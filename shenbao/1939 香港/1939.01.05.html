<h3 id="c1">日本政變及其動向的剖述 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>據今日各報的消息，苦悶多日的近衛內閣果然提出總辭職的呈文，並聞已得日皇的批准，今晚赴興津訪謁西園寺公爵的湯淺內大臣，九時囘東京後，後繼組閣人物及閣僚就可以確定。現在的問題，就只在於近衛留任再來一次改選呢？抑另選別人出來組織新內閣呢？各方面的推測不一，但据我們的觀察，近衛此次或許不再做馮婦了。因爲目前的問題第一在於抑壓政黨及議會以便今年度龐大的預算案及總動員法實施法案得以通過議會，第二在於此後勇敢組織一國一黨的新黨。日本現在的客觀需要一個更法西斯化的政府，但是近衛已不能應付這一個局面，新黨的黨魁更不願意担任，法西斯軍部已不願意再利用下去，但看末次之強硬要求近衛斷然解散議會可知。不過，後任的人物，也不一定就由法西斯薪領袖的末次出來組閣，其原因是：（一）末次的鋒鋩過於顯露，名望又不够；（二）末次雖儼然爲法西斯的領袖，但却爲元老，重臣及財閥所不贊成，今日的日本政局還需要財，政，軍各方面勢力的調和。此外，如寺內，湯淺及南等人雖也有人推測其爲後繼首相，但不够條件較末次爲甚。比較有希望的恐怕還是平沼，因爲他的名望較高，且在平時即有右派法西斯的擁護，對於調和軍，政，財，容易發生效力。至其閣員的去留，據我的推測池田，末次，米內，木戶等人或須去職，而板垣，有田，及荒木等人或將再度上台。此後日本政府將於可能程度內調和各派勢力的條件下積極推進法西斯的統治，是可斷言的。</p>
<p>但是一切橫陳在日本政府眼前的許多問題，却仍無法容易克服。</p>
<p>日本首相近衛，繁忙奔走於重臣，閣僚，政黨及財閥等方面，結果仍不能調和內閣內部的衝突，仍不能免於總辭職，其動向正値得我們注意。在日本第七十四囘議會行將召開的目前，在日本正着手於「改造遠東」的車大工作的今日，特別是在汪精衛先生行動和言論離奇的這幾天，日本政局嚴重的情勢和此後潛伏的矛盾，我們應有一番的剖述。這裏特地加以分析，以見此後日本政局動盪的趨向：</p>
<p>（一）日本內閣此後的改組只有更迭人物而無補强的作用，徒然加深政界的矛盾。日本政府變動，希望再來一次去年五月間　大補强，似已不可能，因爲日本對華的侵略戰爭到了「向下期，和以前的情勢截然兩樣。到這時候，日本內部的矛盾不但大爲複雜化，並且各種矛盾皆漸深刻至無法調和的地步，例如軍事擴大與財力萎縮的矛盾，獨占中國權益與調整外交的矛盾，結束對華戰爭與擾亂中國秩序的矛盾，開發中國資源與日本資本短缺的矛盾，乃至拉攏德意與討好英美的矛盾等等，都是目前最嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>（二）目前日本軍部的意識與國家財力，已經走上「前狀」的發展。日本陸軍次官東條儘管要求軍需工業製造者加倍努力於生產，並宣言準備和中蘇同時作戰，卽近衛十二月二十二日的宣言也稱：「日本政府已决定繼續進行其軍事行動，俾得完全消滅反日的國民黨政府」，但是樞密院方面的持重主張者，却嚴重質問近衛：「戰爭究竟到什麼時候始能結束？在什麼地方結束？」其憂慮並反對戰爭之繼續與擴大，表現於言表。財界且以股票暴跌的趨向答復了好戰者。擴大戰爭需要更多的軍費，明年度日本歲出預算的一般會計卽已比本年增加不少，合侵華軍事費及佔領地行政費計算，當近於百億元。在今日公債消納力達到飽和點而入超大增的時節，不知日本將於什麼方面求得如是鉅額的財政來源。如果認眞實施起總動員法第十一條，甚至於徽用私有財產，這又為資本主義社會所不容，更非高高坐在統治交椅上的財閥們所能容受的。不知道近衛有何法術可以調節這個矛盾？澈底犧牲中小工業以保全大工業，特別是軍需工業家嗎？日本經濟機構勢必整個崩壞。</p>
<p>（三）就最近遠東的情勢看來，日本主觀上必欲企圖獨佔中國的權益，但在客觀上日本又似非調整它與各國的外交關係不可。日本自粵漢戰後屢次發表的狂妄宣言及獨佔中國權益的企圖，已經碰到英美强硬的釘子，英美並餘用援華制日的實際手殺答復了，日本所以日本不但　來在華南的軍事行動已稍鎭靜，卽現階段日本對華政策綜合表示的十二月二十日的近衛宣言，也再重申其斯騙各國的辭令，說：「關於中日經濟合作一點，日本並無意獨佔中國的經濟權，可非欲要求中國限制第三國在華的經濟利益」云云。又在日蘇的關係上，近衛政府又覺得束手無策。不但日軍進攻西北切斷國際交通路綫的企圖，沒有半步的前進，近日還須繁忙調動大軍出關去佈防，不但對蘇聯強硬提出的所謂修正漁約沒有得到蘇聯簽字，倒反在李維諾夫關於反共協定對蘇挑戰的質問下，碰了一鼻子灰，大討沒趣，只好自歎一口氣說：等候明春再談判罷！誠心誠意和英美法蘇調和嗎？征服中國的野心不允許，軍部也不答應，索性和上列各國大玩起「火一來嗎，又爲力量所嚴格限制着。不知道日本政府將如何使「軍事與財政當局能與負外交責任者和衷共濟」呢？</p>
<p>（四）日本目前對華的政策，是結束戰事　擾亂中國的手段同時並用着，一方面企圖結束中日戰爭，如日報所傳近衛正奔走於「早日終止對華戰爭之程序」，另一方面又於最近的宣言中，表示日本政府已决定繼續進行軍事行動。這無可驚疑，前者所指的爲中日戰爭，後者則顯然爲中國內戰畫因日本的陰謀欲以中國內戰代替中日戰爭（參閱，報寸二月六日『日本對和平論者的答復」），其所以急於抬出吳佩孚來，原因卽在於此。但是日本這一企圖已經完全陷入苦悶當中，日軍不退出中國境地，中國的抗日戰爭是不會終止的，今日中國的情勢已非以前可比，同仇敵愾勝過其他的慾望，日本的企圖是不易如願以償的。即令最近有汪精衛的病狂言行，但事實上依然不能影響中國抗戰的大局。</p>
<p>（五）日本目前集中精神在開發中國資源以補救它自己的貧血症，即如好戰主義者板垣，也於粵漢戰後的一次談話中表示：「此後在中國佔領區的方針，已改軍事第一主義爲治安第一主義」了。但是開發資源的第一個條件，是鉅量的資本，日本自己的資本已不充分，又不肯容許瑛美法自由投資，所以開發的工作就非碰牆不可，華中開發資金未能决定，卽其確證。日本政府或者應用總動員法第十一條，禁止資本投於日本政府認爲不急要的產業部門，而強制金融機關投督於緊急事業，但是在華新企業之開設並不更急於日本國內破產企業救濟，數月來，日本中小工業的救濟問題，不是已成日本政界的大問題了嗎？日本政府顧此失彼，不知其將如何解决這一矛盾呢？</p>
<p>（五）自從『九一八事變』以來，日本對德意兩個帮兇的拉攏，確實非常猛進。德意兩國也樂與勾結，所以由三國反共協定到了文化協定，以至醞釀中的軍事三角同盟，德國的大砲換了東三省的大豆。由希特拉的承認僞滿到日方承認德國在華北的貿易特權。（據大阪每日十一月二十五日所載消息）意大利也步着同樣的步伐。德報竟至彈冠相慶，稱；『外國對華貿易卽當完全改觀，而由日德意三國居於控制地位，各民　國現有勢力則什推翻之列』（紐約民聲講壇報所載）。國社黨機關報的民衆觀察報更稱：『東京方面頃已談及中國鐵礦，凡在日本控制下的，均得由。意參加開發。』日本對德意的引誘已無以復加，而德意亦大爲日本聲援，德　陰　擾亂烏克蘭。戈培爾演說的狂妄，乃至意大利對法國的威脅及對英國的牽制，在在都是法西斯集團勾結進展的表現。但是日本這一作法又恰與緩和英美法蘇的必要相衝突。倘若日本侵略者沒有擴大國際的冒險的决心，如日本反戰作家鹿地　先生所言，「此後或將强硬化，用海軍完全封銷海岸，用陸軍遮斷國際公路，最後對華宣戰」（見十二月廿七日各報），則日本政府永久無法打開這個外交的僵局，無論近衛再上舌或由別人細閣，這一問題乃是無法解决的。</p>
<p>一九三九年來到了，日本政局的難關是與年而俱增的，第七十四屆議會首先橫在眼前，不知道日本新政府將如何渡過些重重的暗礁呢？</p>

<h3 id="c2">暗夜旅南昌 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 王墳</p>
<p>想不到在南昌，竟會留下我們的足跡。</p>
<p>當殘秋的夜風輕輕地搖曳書滿天星斗的那一晚，我們這一家流亡的人，被浙贛路車載到了一個陌生的城市，這是南昌，這是一個新與的城市；崇高的車站轟立在我們的眼前，我們第一次踏進了這個城市的領域，一邊歡欣，一邊却又無端的害怕。數欣，我們能够從車裏安全地走了下來；可是害怕，這一個陌生的城市，我們將怎樣進去生活呢？然而比歡欣和害怕更使我們不能忍受的，那是勞疲！從浙江桐盧輾轉來到南昌，雖然在平時只須一兩天、而我們却花費了一星期以上的時日、如果我們半遊覽地拖延着行期、那當然是非常安閒的行旅、其如我們都懷着焦急的心、挨餓挨凍地躭擱着、在徵江的急灘中、我們坐着小船流着大汗、看船夫在急流中拉撑篙、好幾次叫我們變色戰慄、那不是膽怯、這一程水路實在太危險了、在龍游的車站上、我們坐了三夜、沒有法子趁車、看着列列的車輛急驟地馳過、都是早已擠滿了傷兵的所謂客車、即使在月台旁停下、我們還是沒有法干搭上去、這樣、在小小的茅屋中居然停留了三夜、好運氣在第四天晚上竟給我們搭上了車、而在車上、又那麼　坐了一晚、所以到了南昌、我們實在不能够忍受沿途所得的疲勞了、</p>
<p>一下車、第一件事情當然是找旅館、然而　、烏黑的巷子、陌生的路途、這末晚的天色、到那裏去找呢、我把行李提出了車站、抱着一個最小的孩子、招呼家人都上了人力車、管他們拉我們到什麼地方去、過了一段靜僻的田野、望見一條齊整的大路、第一家旅館的招牌映入我們眼簾的是『華中』、好、就進去問問吧、賬房囘說沒有、而日說各家旅館都早已客滿了、我又開始躭憂起來、難道我們要露宿在街上嗎、雖然聽說遭逢這種災難的人、隨處都有、但是我們沒有遭到過。　且。有老人有孩子、也怎末經得起在街上露宿呢、一陣戰慄通過我的全身、我禁不住素索地震顫了一下、望望那些跟行李什麼的堆在門外車子裏的老人和孩子、我不能不可憐地哀求那個矮胖的賬房了、賑房間明了我的來歷、竟然出我意外地替我設法了一個小小的房間、那是他們自己佔住的一室、向來並不出租的、現在只收我很低的賃金、讓我們在此歇宿、這情誼實在叫我們感激，常時我來不及看那房間，急忙跑到門外去招呼他們下車，把行李寄存在賬房旁邊的儲藏室裏，興奮地扶老携幼，跟着旅館的夥計走通那湫隘的房間，不計狹窄，也不等舖位不够，便打開兩個舖蓋舖了開來，孩子們沒有洗臉，便已經呼呼入睡，發着不很淸晰的夢曇了。</p>
<p>這一夜，我們都睡得很酣甜，沒有回顧過去，也沒有展望未來，只顧酣甜地睡去；因爲幾天的疲勞，實在把我們磨折得够累了。</p>

<p>中日戰事發生後、日本貨卽隨軍而大量來華銷售、麵粉輸華之盛、尤堪注意、但近月來忽有激减之勢、以日粉之輸入「華北」而論、本年三月進口九十六萬餘袋、五月減至七十二萬袋、至九月已僅十三萬袋、　月份亦無起色、此何以故、據日入自述其原因有二、</p>

<p>【二】澳洲　粉價遠較日粉爲低、故對「華北」之輸出、反日見增大、如本年四五月已有五十萬袋之進口、至九月已突破一百萬袋之紀錄、日本地位可謂已被澳州所取而代之、</p>

<p>美國加省議會議員兼該會軍事組委員會主席及財政學專家多遞氏、最近抵港、前日參加本港扶輪會聚會、演講英美問題、對遠東問題、亦有說及、主張英美應合作應付、記者昨特再行走訪、叩以對遠東問題之具體意見、當同多氏道達來意後、多氏笑語記者、昨彼昨（前）所申述者、不過此間題之槪略、隨謂時至今日、</p>
<p>遠東局面　確已呈極度嚴重、英美兩國、實應迅予採取共同行動、以資應付、蓋×人在遠東所引起之糾紛、其事實之表現、如牽涉中國內政、如成立僞組織等×人片面行動、固爲各國所萬難承認、此種行動之指歸、蓋將排除各國在華利益、而實行壟斷耳、此則與門戶開放政策、絕不相容也、彼所主張之英美共同行動、卽爲維持此項政策、設法將此戰事終結、不過于此應行提出者、美國人民絕大多數對中國此次之</p>

<p>從×貨冒充國貨說起</p>
<p>魚目混珠，以僞亂眞，認識不够的很容易上當，給欺騙過了。但是魚目究竟是魚目，任你做得怎樣工巧，結果還是瞞不過識貨者的眼光的。對於×貨，也是同樣的道理。</p>
<p>××××××，每一個中國人差不多都　有兩個信念：第一，加速對方的經　崩潰；第二，完成抗戰建國的偉業。抗戰以後，×貨在中國，可以說如扛河日下，廻非昔比；內地除了偷運的一小部份防不勝防之外，公然運入的已不再見，就是香港，×貨的銷數也因之而一銳减」·但是「銳减」祇是「銳减」，却不是「絕跡」；甚而在最近幾個月來，反見『增加』。這是甚麼道理？×××××××××××××，此中自然也不外是受「魚目混珠』那一套的欺騙。往昔，×貨魚目混珠的手段單純是改裝運入，縱然認識不够，也還可以仔細嚴詰一下，結果總易决定是「珠」或許是「魚目」；但可憐今日中國的工廠竟然有一部份變成了製造×貨的機關，鑒別更是一樁頭痛的事。</p>
<p>原來自上海淪陷×手後，上海谷大工廠雖然大部份已遵奉國府的命令　移，遷人內地的不下二十多家，遷來本港的也有十七家，但是仍有一部是處在×人勢力範圍之內不能及時撤退的，資×利用，是不可避免的事。×人佔據之後，源源製貨，用華商的名義運到香港，這樣一來，不但不知道是×貨，反而當做國貨推銷，×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××。幾個月來，改裝入口的×貨爲什麼會突增呢，×××××××××××。</p>
<p>去年，××公司被貼標語的事，鬧得滿城風雨。××××，很値得我們在這個時候重提一下。買×貨的，×××××××××，而是「認識不够」；識貨者却是賣貨的，明知是魚目混珠的×貨，拿來欺騙客人，該誅之至！昨日報載中央查禁×貨條例中，規定以×貨冐充國貨者處死刑，嚴刑峻法，可稱洽當　　　　　　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>不久以前，上海職業界聯合會訂××××××××××××，有兩點最直得注意：一，運用社會的力量來積極推進，務求普遍深入與切實有效；二，××××××××××××××××，要絕對不姑息不徇私。的確，祗要能運用社會的力量，比任何力量都來得更有效。××公司的事件，不就是社會力量的表現嗎！××××上海的同胞，在那麼特殊的環境中，也毫不游疑地幹那種神聖的工作·</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>海軍大檢閱巡禮　諾具爾少將以時局嚴重勗隊員努力</p>
<p>海軍落後的國家的國民，參觀友邦的進步的　軍大檢閱，內心不由自主地充滿着無限的慚悚。</p>
<p>可是，回想我們神聖的抗戰已經展開，新中國的前途，已在漫漫長夜中透露曙光：我們的「明天」快要降臨了，今天友邦的進步現象未始不是我們明天建國的好榜樣。記者終于以興奮的心情，代替慚悚的　懷，昨天早上，就匆匆忙忙增前　跑馬地參觀英國駐港海軍的戰隊的週年大檢閱。</p>
<p>檢閱時間原定上午十時，可是在幾十分　前人馬都已經築齊了。時間神聖，自然亦是一種好現象。</p>
<p>廣大的跑馬塲，像蓋着一福黃綠色的　子。成千個海軍，分成九個中隊站立着，屹然地一點沒有動，亦沒有聲，這樣一幅　默的圖書，只有檢閱有所乘着的馬兒尾巴很　活地上下左右拂動着，吸引着周　無數的觀衆的注意，怪有趣味的。</p>
<p>這次被邀請前往觀操的：有英駐華陸軍總司令賈乃錫少將，港海軍司令狄根，空軍司令官柏克，陸軍軍官麥蘭登，陸軍參謀長愛雲人佐，和法國留港軍艦艦長等數百人。其他各機關長官，及中西　商被邀前往觀操者亦爲數甚衆，大槪有千人左右。</p>
<p>司令台上面的大時鐘已經正十時了，站在司令台最高處的指揮打一下旗語，全場的海軍像觸電一般，很迅速而很整齊地立正，托槍，集體的動作，簡直是一個人的動作，紀律在團體中看出它的偉大作用。</p>
<p>悠揚雄壯的音樂，接着亦奏了起來，激激了靜寂寂的空氣，檢閱的儀式從此揭開序幕。</p>
<p>首先，隊員齊向諾少將行軍人最敬禮，總指揮官布關氏即乘馬辛司令台前　請諾少將檢閱，檢閱官計有英駐華海軍總司令諾員爾中將，總指揮爲伯明漢號英艦長布蘭，副指揮官爲伯明漢號英盤司令官樣吉特諾中將……等，共有六員，威風凜凜地乘着黑色駿馬，慢慢地在九個中隊前面經過，檢閱。</p>
<p>接着檢閱官拉住馬鞭，站在中間的旗幟下面，九個中隊就轉成直行，前進接連着從檢閱官前面經過。</p>
<p>這次受檢閱的主體除英駐華留港海陸戰隊外，並有海軍兩隊，陪同　演。他們的精神，是格外的雄糾糾。</p>
<p>最有趣的是一律的皮鞋，黑絨服裝，綠色脚包與束帶，和白頂的制帽與「海軍型」的反領，一模一樣也好像線條很明顯的圖案、</p>
<p>塲上士兵個個荷着長槍，刺刀閃閃。這是可怕的武器，可是「和平」要靠它來保障·這樣的槍刀，在這個偉大莊嚴的廣場上，又成爲構成圖案的「藝衛品」了。</p>
<p>當托槍，放下槍，左轉，右轉，前進，立正的時候，整齊的步伐與一上一下的手腕擺動……簡直只有一樣的動作，亦是饒有趣味。在團體中沒有個人的自由，在此亦顯示出來。</p>
<p>這樣浩浩蕩蕩的大隊前進，敎我們聯想釗祖國的英勇健兒，就是這樣馳聘疆塲。在贊美友邦的海軍中，同時懷思到祖國的忠勇將士之偉大。</p>
<p>接着，諾少將親致訓詞，由播音機播送出來，全場均聞。時針指着十時三刻，這個降重的議式就宣告閉幕了。</p>
<p>出塲時，由六員長官騎馬導前，軍樂隊在中間，全體海軍排成整齊的隊伍踏踏踏踏從市囘到兵房或艦上。經過的地方，家家戶戶都湧出來看熱鬧。有的是感哨「中國不如英國」—有的是相信我們明天亦會學習友邦的榜樣。</p>
<p>關于諾少將訓詞是以時局嚴重勗隊員努力。原詞如下：</p>
<p>「各位親受同僚，週年之中，鄙人以爲祇有今朝乃有機會，能使鄙人向許多同僚致詞：今日的大檢閱，鄙人認爲是最有其價値的。」第一點：是使諸位秩序化，第二點是使諸位合作化，子許多同僚，　同操演。諸位能集合各單位，成今日的大會操，這稱合作性的表現，是値得稱許的，同時，又使身爲長官的，有機會以命令他的部屬，各隊員又有機會來擎起他的槍桿。關子隊員有機會擎起他的槍桿，我以爲是最重要的一點，吾們海軍人員，要知道海軍的準備與訓總，是有其難鉅的責任的；尤其是吾們奉調駐華的海軍，亦就是今日我海軍各艦，無時不準備用以保陣我英人的性命與財產的。記得去年七月一日，吾們派出海軍人員一百一十人，從陸路赴漢口。他們雖然處子困難的環境中，但亦能幹出美滿的工作；在地中海的，我們海軍又命睦軍合作，綏靖了巴力斯坦的亂事；這樣看起來，陸戰隊的訓練是非常重要的。諸位今日所表現的，鄙人甚感　佩，鄙人又知諸位親愛軍人，當以不斷的不長難精神，　成好身手。我們今日雖處在　世界多事之秋的時候，但鄙人敢以諸位　誇耀，及對英君有信心。卽使將來有任何事件發生，諸位必能　其所能，勿原我諸國駐華艦隊有感覺不足的。』</p>

<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族曲話</p>
<p>淸張聲玠的一折雜劇「畫隱」寫的是畫家趙子固和他的從弟子昂的故事，他們倆是趙氐宗室，宋室旣亡，子固隱而不仕，子昂却靦顏事元，子昂來訪問子固，子固幾笑了他一場，這本之於下面兩種　記：</p>
<p>『子固買舟湖下，飲酣，晚帽以酒晞　。薄暮入西冷，掠孤山，艤掉茂樹間，指林麓最幽處，瞪目絕叫曰：「此眞洪谷子董北苑得怠筆也！」鄰舟數—皆驚駭絕，歎以爲眞謫仙人！』（宋周密齊東野語）</p>
<p>「子周入本朝，不樂仕進，隱居州之廣陳鎭。從弟子昂自　來訪，公閉門不納。夫人勸公，始令從后門入·坐定第問：「弁山笠澤近來佳否？」子昂曰「什·」公日「弟奈山澤佳何？」子昂退。使人濯坐具·」（元姚桐壽樂郊私語）</p>
<p>此劇寫子固聞從弟應元主才士詔以后，憤然唱集賢聽黃鶯道：「趨朝濟濟鳴玉珂，說聖代恩波。全不想故國河山誰打破，向丹墀舞蹈賡歌！（我想國家養士三百年，只得文少保等幾個忠臣！留夢炎以狀元宰相，子　以宗室至親，尙且靦然失節·其他又何問乎！）耐不得首陽飢餓，學不得遼東高臥。問誰何肯早憂王室，荊棘泣銅駝！</p>
<p>後來船家見子固畫畢而臥，誤以子固爲子昂便說：「惜哉呀惜哉！弗應該做子故隻×官。自古道父母之　，弗共戴大。譬如唔祖宗個田產，本勒人　奪子去末，直頭要搭俚做輸贏哉—那舍嘸子淘成到從順了俚介！」</p>
<p>僮　對於子昂的嘲謔也很有趣。僮兒聽說子　只許從後進去，便說：「堂堂學士，前門末　頭弗進。那舍鬼出冰生，到走子俚個後門。要是嘸子後鬥末，直頭要　俚個狗洞哉！』子昂劈頭就被子固說訕：『隔別數年，不料你一朝發跡至此！』出門沒有好氣，　兒又說：『老爺勿要氣哉，勿番海個。唔有兩句　語，說本勒唔聽聽：笑駡由他笑駡，好官我自爲之！』</p>
<p>不知是爲了愛惜子昂之才呢，還是爲了作者自已也是異埃之臣，蔣士銓的冬靑樹對於子昂却沒有多少貶辭，反而像是稱　似的；這一點似不及痛史的作者淸末吳沃堯，他却賦予更多的同情給子固。可是，像張聲玠這樣痛快淋漓的嘲駡漢奸　就是吳沃堯對之，也當自愧不如吧？</p>

<h3 id="c28">一九三八年的文藝評論界 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>抗戰文藝一般論方面，主要的，是討論創作方　的問題·因爲這是現階段抗戰文藝基本問題。</p>
<p>對　　問題，茅質先生在「文藝陣地」第一卷第九期裏一八月的感想——抗戰文勢一年的回顧」一文裏，發揮過非常正確而珍貴的意見。又經常地在「文陣」的「書評」裏以懇摯的態度給我們以最實際的深　的指示。「在抗戰文藝」第十三期，又發衣過「論加强批評的工作」。　秀俠先生在「文陣」一卷四期　發表了一篇「現實主義的抗戰文學論」，也把抗戰又藝上的觀念化，抽象化，單調化等膚淺傾向給以止確的指摘。此外，以日本的革命作家而參加我國抗戰的「當代拜倫」的鹿地口先生，也先後在一戰地半月刊」第五六期　續發表「文學的感想」，在「七月」第三集第五期上發表「文學學雜論』，在抗「戰文藝」第六期發表一關於「藝術和宣傅』的問題」及「七月」諸同人開過兩次的一文藝座談會」，等等。</p>
<p>抗戰以後的文藝，從類別的生產上去看，報告　學和劇本生產的最多，詩歌次之，小說再次之。從創柞傾向上去看·則正如矛盾先生在「八月的感想」裏所分析：</p>
<p>「過去一年的前半期（當然這是極粗疏的分法），文壇上的主要傾向是着眼于一個個的壯烈塲面的描寫。大多數作品把抗戰中的英勇壯烈的故事作爲題材，而且企圖從這些故事的本身說明了時代的偉大！　中國人民的决心與勇敢，認識與希望，對目前犧牲之忍受興對最後勝利之確信。這樣的企圖再加上沒有充分的時間去構思去體驗等等原因，就不自覺地弄成了注重寫『事』而不注重寫『人』的現象。換句話說，就是先有了固定故事的　子，然後塡進人物云，而中國人民的决心與勇敢，認識與希望，對目前犧牲之忍受與最後勝利之確信等觀念，則又分配塡在人物身上。</p>
<p>一我以爲那時同的作品絕少令人滿意　結在於作家之不深入生活者尙少，而在於描寫壯烈事件之成爲風氣者實多。</p>
<p>『從『事』轉到『人』，可說是最近半年來的一大趨勢。、</p>
<p>『最後，我覺得最近半年來抗戰文藝的又進一步是作家間進始有選擇有計劃地描寫壯烈事件中最典型的事件。』</p>
<p>這一番分析，不但是指出了一年來抗戰文藝的事作傾向，更且指示出了文藝　作的　本問　，——寫人，有了人物，冉編配故事：描寫典型環境中的人物性格。</p>
<p>這是事實：抗戰初起後不久幾乎所有的文藝作品，都是寫壯烈的事件，或者寫侵略者姦淫據掠，屠殺的暴行。這造成作品的單調，千篇一律，因之，茅盾先生，一再的呼籲要寫人；祝秀俠先生也嚴重指摘：我們不但要描寫壯烈事件，我們不但要表現侵略者的暴行，我們尤要表現親日派托派漢奸及一切舊時代的殘渣。那些阻碍抗戰建國的負的因素；我們尤要表現侵略者軟硬並旋的毒辣陰謀手段，如收買漢好，招撫無智流民回去淪陷區做順民等。這此指示，對過去，現在，和以後的抗戰　藝，都是適用的原則，我國的抗戰，是民族革命的戰爭，對外是打倒日本帝國主義，爭取民族獨自由的民族戰爭；對內是在砲火的廢墟上建立自由福的新中國的革命戰爭。抗戰文藝要負起這個神聖的任務。抗戰文藝必須從多方面的，關聯的，動的角度，去觀察，去體驗和表現典型環卜的典型的民族英雄，典型的民族殘渣，同樣地必須表現侵略者的硬的手段——暴行，軟的陰謀——利誘。　（未完）</p>

<p>隨便舉個例子，讓「我們來認識一下近衛的　術，然後再說到販子們的本領。譬如，日本「法西斯要創立其大陸政策」的偉業，於是，像給什麼鬼嚇的慌慌張張叫起來：『支那有紅色，那一定是赤化，非防共不可，』結果「皇軍」出動了。這是一例。其次是：跟着紅色顏料之施用，又來了建立東亞「新秩序」的綠色「和平一顏料，自然，還有其他黃色的什麼一王道」牌顏　等等。</p>
<p>混在抗戰中　好細，大抵也是持顏料來粉飾粉飾的。不過，此　使用顏料可非常　巧，忽而顯出「犧牲色』，忽而「焦土色」，忽而「逃跑色」忽忽而「蔚藍色」……眞是不勝其化樣白出，但到底還是『精衛色』。而「精衛色」却和「近衛色」正相調和，於是出現了驚人的『重要建議。』變色術至此窮盡，汪先生的漢好原形，也就畢露無遺。今後用不者再施色料。</p>
<p>這是一　變色戲，其實，明眼人早就向國人警告要小心的。當然，現在原形已現，大家可以明白了，但我們不能就此以爲可鬆一口氣了，請提高應有的警惕性、準備應付可能引起的事件吧！</p>

<p>— 林螢牕</p>
<p>灰黯色的大幕慢慢地移開，星月閃放着除輝，一陣轟然的泡聲簡破了萬　底沉寂，機警的晨鷄也拍　翅提起頸項高叫，尖銳的聲波刺破了我底愁夢，揉揉無力的懶眼，揩掉了那多餘的淚水，透視着窗外紗籠的大地。</p>
<p>哄降的一陣巨嚮，空谷裏起着傳應，觸動了敏感的腦子，斜睨那案　的日曆，光剩着二根鋼柱發亮；一顆流浪的心，油然　起了故鄉！廈鬥的元且：一條慰勞國軍的偉大行列，配齊着幾萬的羣眾，從那定安路婉蜓出發，像一條　地的巨能，沿途爆迸着雄昂的救　歌聲和激烈的口號，朝着駐軍防地出發，虎園路上，停滯着嚴兩團結活潑緊張的空氣，軍兵打成一片，保衛大　門的口號衝　了正午的暴日！</p>
<p>。我把被踢開　一骨碌爬起來，背脊靠在矮小的木屏，我興奮，我感覺得什麼都比不上那天的痛快。現在，今年的元旦，流浪　這裏，聽不到這有力的吼聲，嗅不到火藥味，甚至唱歌，高喊，人家也要呌你　口！可是；家鄉裏的親戚朋友，正在鐵蹄高壓下輾轉掙扎。，也許：今年的元旦，是所謂「市政府」的成立，謟媚無恥的傀儡們正在粉墨登塲，彈冠相賀。造裏所能聽得的，自然與那裏不同。我可以聽到的是騎樓下臥病的呻吟。饑餓的哀聲，和那喧囂的汽車聲，「麻將」的交響，還有那茶館酒家的呼喝猜拳，爵士樂的悠揚繞樑，及鴇母的無情打駡，「國際市場」十的穢淫的招攬。</p>
<p>不久；斷腸的呻吟陸續地刺激　混雜的神經，我那預料的第一聲叫了！我甦醒，我怕，心裏像受到重大打擊，我緊抱着頭，閉了雙眼　進被窩，但週身冷顫，恐怖之神在四面圍襲，看看死的命運就要到來！但我咬緊牙關，反抗，鬥爭，全身燒　狂熱。</p>
<p>熹微的曙光越過了窗欄，照到了慘白的臉上，我睜開眼睛，瞥見迎面飄揚的靑天白日滿地紅，仍在招展，這昭示我要保衛我們的國家，我應到祖國去奮鬥，不再留連於這島上！</p>

<h3 id="c32">買舊書 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 沙利文</p>
<p>買舊書却是我一種僻好，這是鑽書坊趣味的另一方面，因爲書坊全是新書，價錢當然貴一些，愛書的人有時候也吝嗇一些，原因是自已的不寬裕。縱然書坊裏也有價格便宜的「一折八扣」書，然不盡是合我的胃口。不得意而求其次，於是舊書攤，舖店，到處有我的份，想拿低賤的價錢找尋自己心愛的書，雖則在一所黑而小的屋裏擠着，或者蹲在　人道旁晒太陽，耗費很多的時間，我全不愛惜，挾着書回去的時候，我楚愉快的，像孩子們的口袋裏有一句糖，有時候買舊書的抬高書價，或者明知知是好書而自己口袋裏綫不多，祇有發呆，老是翻着書員不想地，離開的時候還回頭望望，彷彿是自已的損失。</p>
<p>買舊書的最大毛病是病菌的傳染，還有損壞汚穢，買囘家之後，不得不費一份工夫，用來洗刷，擲拍，吹曬，黏貼，釘裝·盡了許多心力，一册舊書　我的中間已有了一份深的交情，不比新書的淡泊，在閱讀的時候是加重趣味的力量，我常常誘起這種感覺，似乎它是我底老朋友。</p>
<p>舊書還有種特殊的趣味，是一册書的前一個主人！—甚至轉手過兩三次的，在我做第三次書的主人不是比做一册新書的主人更好嗎！這是一種魔力，譬之我會買到前一主人他處員的　，縱然是上海，南京，香港，廣州廈門……遠遠地互相交換着。在前十年別人手裏的，今犬落在自己的書架上。別人用一元兩九的大價貿的，而我紙是用十分之一或二十分之一的代價買進。許多事情是一件故事，傳奇式的。若是書本是有靈性的，他會說出一部滄桑的歷史，可惜我祇能找尋前人的筆跡去探求它的表面。</p>
<p>還有舊書上劃着的曲線，符號，詳細的註解，大胆的批評，荒唐的意見，滑稽的穿揷，以及斷句，短聯，怪言，歪詩…一方面可以做我閱讀時候的參致，另一方面却也是正經文章之外的最好消遣。</p>
<p>買舊書倒是我一種僻好，「這僻好是太可愛的」，若是你是我的同道；你會說這句話。</p>

<p>〔本　特訊〕爆竹一聲、多難的民國廿七年是已經跟隨時代的巨輪逝去了、在這民廿八年降臨後日幾天裏、籃球房頗冷落、到了昨宵、因爲按表又有三場球賽舉行、故臨塲看客·倒算熱鬧·</p>
<p>第一場是雪花對梅芳、零花的實力、已經是比梅芳相差很遠、加之梅芳隊又是她的姊姊、正因爲這樣、比賽經過、常然不大緊凑、戰至嗚金收軍、雪花爲着成全姊姊的冠軍美夢起見、以二十比四十五打個敗仗、</p>
<p>次塲南華對西南、以兩隊的實力觀測、　華本不在西南之下、但是、南華各將爲暑投籃欠準的緣故、不得不低首稱臣也、</p>
<p>第一節開始、南華樂西南右後衛犯規之便、先面紀錄、貶眼間、西南也照樣取回一分、這時　方的　士、精神都很飽　、你　我往、好像拉鋸一般、混戰很久西南又藉對方犯規之便、賡續連取　分、以三比二結束這一節的攘奪、</p>
<p>第二節戰幕重啓、西南各將趁乘先勝的餘威、織織又遠投中的、但南華頗不示弱、　芬亦乘罰球之使、取厄二分、西南各將竭力相持、續分并不落後、再戰片待、南華因爲各將投籃不甚準確、失機很多、此節仍不免落後一點、</p>
<p>下半塲開始後、西南士氣稍　、致爲南華所乘、三位前　、足跡滿佈西南禁地、一眨眼、　芬建功于　、美薇若梅得手在後、續分起越西南之　、西南各　有鑒於是、爲保持優勝局面社、都很努力、怎奈于時已詎此節完結不遠、甫由識織囘敬一隻後、　笛卽鳴、十七比十三、西南反走下　、</p>
<p>末節爲生死關頭、西南固然不肯放鬆、南華亦不甘示弱、因此戰來很爲　張、精彩發見、十分　後、南華不幸命運、即告開始、各方不特屢投不中、反視西南鋒面、配枝、若梅如得神助、再建三功、反以二十三比十七領先數歡點、南華爲略避鋒　起見、要求暫歇一時、但西南鬥志正盛、　裏有些　影響呢、這樣直至戰事結束、　華仍不免以十七比二十四吃敗仗、</p>
<p>末場爲港大對聖保羅、未戰前、一般人已知道保羅必不是港大的對手、但雖則這樣、趣味却最濃厚是道場、因爲聖保羅的球員、臨時召集了許多娘子啦啦隊、大捧　場、戰至緊張處、嬰宛輩都張開櫻唇、喊至聲斯力竭、但是、港人也拉了多西裝客來幫忙、你呼　我呌、然是不趣、至于說到戰情、不用說是有點那個了、直至完　笛鳴、二十此十二、港大奪得勝利而返、（　底人）</p>

<p>還有、本港籃球界切勿自視　高、其實技術上還是在幼稚時期、記得兩年前有一美艦到港、派隊約本港所謂各勁旅作友誼賽、結果、美水兵橫掃一切、而其時本港籃世界的技術比現在還好得多哩、　（東郎）</p>

<p>先奔跑約四分之一英哩、其速度須合乎中庸、使身體温暖、然後稍　緩她繼、續再跑四分之一英哩速度和開始時相同、但至最後的百一碼時須　畫至力以求達到最高的速度、跑完後稍作急的步行、總之以散步與奔跑交替而行、時間以四十五分鐘至一小時爲取適宜、注意步伐的齊整、</p>
<p>在歸途中、可參以他種運動、如　跳爬樹「引體上升」（Chfnn　Dng）等、這樣就可以收獲最大的效果、同時也能發達胸肩臂各部的肌肉、</p>
<p>行　種運動、最容易構成　動過度的弊害、所以當我們感覺疲乏的時候應立刻停止、切勿過分勉强、可改以急速的步行來完舉全程、至於路程的連近也要預先計劃、</p>
<p>運動完後、切勿使身體驟冷、須立刻沐浴、不可遲疑浴後再用粗糙的大毛巾來摩擦主身、然後安　的休息約一小時、</p>
<p>跳繩和跳躍運動一一這種運動可用以　、替露天的奔跑和步行、但最有效的方法就是間日行之例如星期一、二、五、行奔跑和步行運動、　期二、四、六行跳繩和跳躍運動、這樣興趣也比較濃厚、行跳繩運動時如覺過於輕易可改以兩腿分別而行、於跳襯運動最好選做那些同時有益於軀幹的運動、</p>
<p>呼吸運動——運動時如呼方法錯誤、對　健康實有很大的損害、尤其是在舉行那些以鍛鍊長力爲主的運動時更要謹愼、在行劇烈的運動時、肺臟如需要的空氣較半時多出七八倍、由此可知祇要呼吸方法止確、任何運動同時都可收呼吸運動的功效、　（中）</p>

<p>一國的駐外使節，是其國家和政府的代表；至於大使是駐外代表中最崇高的職位，按照外交慣例曾，不但足以代表一國的政府，且足以代表該國的元首。所以一個大使的發言，往往可爲國際交涉的依據，至其爲世界輿論所重視，更不待言。我國夙昔閉關自守，嚴格言之，原無所謂外交。近數十年來在帝國主義侵略之下，駐外代表大多數只有辦外交之名，而未能眞爲國家民族謀求利益·唯全面抗戰發動以後，情勢乃爲之一變，如我駐法大使顧維鈞博士，確能展其所長，爲國增榮。但據最近外報通訊，我駐某大國之某大使，輕易發表公開談話，應其一已臆測，擅　我國曾向日表示和意，又在某一次宴會中，發表長篇談話，對於×我情勢，旣無透闢之觀察，對於抗戰前途，竟於作觀的結論。現在事實勝於雄搿，我國愈戰而愈有勇氣，×人則已成「强弩之末」；想必歷來「重視現實」的某大使，今日亦當深愧其過去的失言·然在當時此種失敗主義的悲觀論調，不僅使我海外備民·聞而沮喪，抑且使該大使駐在國的人士，頗致疑於我國持久抗戰之實力與我政府國策的可靠性。所以我們對於某大使的失言深感遺憾·依照一外交家的氣節言·如因發言不愼而致　響國家的利益，理應引咎辭職，以謝國人；因爲旣充國家使節，對於基本國策·决不應有私人批評自由。我們希望某大使應知所以自處，更希望政府今後對於駐外使節的人選是否適宜，言行是否正確·更加嚴格的注意！</p>
<p>當心投降份子的新陰謀</p>
<p>中央决議懲處汪精衛以後，投降份子的活動受了重大的打擊，投降份子暫時的失敗·更影響到近衛內閣的加速崩潰。然而不能誤認爲×奸的活動業。停　；並且要更加當心他們新的陰謀，現在有兩個消息値得注意：第一是×奸方面大事謠傳我國政府的『赤化』，什麼『汪派』『右派』被　，什麼『孫科陳誠領導組織斤傾政府』；尤其是投降份子利用其私辦的報紙，濫造謠言，煽　人心。第二個消息是投降份子總用苦肉計，决犧牲其某某兩私人，發表談話否認前次荒謬通電。前一個消息的主要用意，在於混亂國際視　，離間我內部團結，阻礙我國際援助，但是謠言過分怪誕，中外有識之士，决不相信·事實上不僅共黨一再宣言擁護蔣委員長擁護國民政府，而且這次中央懲汪，又係出自全體在渝中委一致　議，其中還有不少爲昔日汪氏之親信—後一個消息的用意又在惑亂各方視綫，轉移注意焦點·當然國家今日仍望汪氏不要一誤再誤悔禍目新，但是所謂自新的方式，决不是一紙空　可了，而要把具體的事實表示出來。總之×奸們難已日暮途窮，而其陰謀活動則决未中止。我們今後還要加倍提防，最近各方輿論對汪一致譴責，確是極好現象，但望各界對於擁護中央，底打擊×人漢奸及投降主義者的活動，作更有力的表示，而對於一切煽惑人心的謠言，尤應加以有効的制裁！</p>

<p>— 作者　San　Bo</p>
<p>保仁譯自十一月World　News　And　Views</p>
<p>自日本發動侵華戰事以來，日本國內的經濟狀况，日趨惡劣，已成强弩之末，由於中國堅苦車絕的長期抗戰，已使日本的金準備消耗殆盡，當戰事開始時，它的金準備存有一，七〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇圓（日元），但到今年八月一日止，其金準備祇剩五九六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇圓。</p>
<p>今年上半年，日本對外貿易的輸人額，較去年同時明增加百分之三十四，因爲國內原料缺乏之其輸出貨物中的百分之六十要仰仗外國原料製造，尤其是棉花和羊毛，占百分之九十九。田於日本對外易　的入超　它的經濟有江河日下之勞；一九三八年上半年，它共耗去準備金一萬九千五百　圓，以後它將無力向外購買原料，製造軍火。</p>
<p>據美國商務部國際貿易局報告。今年美國輸入日本的軍需原料包括銅，鐵，摩托車，飛機，鐵·石油精等已漸减少，今年的輸入額，比去年減少百分之二十五到百分之八十五不等。戰事開始以來，它的戰事消耗已達七十萬萬圓，占每年全國收入總額白分之五十。其發行的公債總額已達一百八十萬萬元。</p>
<p>戰時國內物價也在日趨暴漲，米價較戰前貴出百分之三十，大麥貴白分之五十七，肉類貴百分之四十一，其他日常生活用品，尤其是舶來品，較戰前高出一倍。</p>
<p>國內工人實得工資，也遷滅跌。軍需工廠的工作時間竟延長到每天十六小時。大部工廠受戰事影響而被迫關門，失業工人今年已增加到一百八十萬人。</p>
<p>日本的農村經濟，已形玻產。一般農民因壯丁及馬四被微，勞力減少，同時農具和肥料缺乏，故生產不足自給，再加上各種苛捐雜稅，弄得農民愁眉蹙額，無不叫苦連天。</p>
<p>由於生活程度高漲，一般貧農小企業工人，工匠等的生計多受到困難·因衣食無着而自殺的人，日益普遍。民衆對政府的壓迫和侵略行爲，無不怨聲叔道。</p>
<p>物價騰貴和工資減低　造成了日本國內不斷的罷工風潮。今年四月東京電氣廠有二千五百工人發動罷工，要求廠方增加工資，結果得到部份勝利。五月四日富士（Fuzi）紡織工廠有二千九白六十男女工人罷工，要求改善待遇。六月中日本神奈川縣有二十五家軍需工廠工人聯合罷工，要求增加工資，結果全部勝利。</p>
<p>鄉村農民也時有騷動，他們要求政府減少免除在家長出征期內的耕地租稅·地主與農民的鬥爭日漸滋長，人民反戰情緒也一天一天在擴大起來。</p>
<p>日本實行的所謂總動員法，使國內中小企業一蹶不振一般中小企業家因身受××，非常奮恨。因反對而被捕的人，不可勝數。今年八月的前兩星期內，有一萬零八百商人及店主被捕入獄。</p>
<p>據各方面統計，這次中日戰事（自戰事開始到本年八月止）日方所受的損失，遠在一就〇四——五年日俄戰爭之上。」</p>
<p>現時中日戰事</p>
<p>日俄戰爭</p>
<p>動員人數……二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇强　一，一〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>死傷人數……七〇〇，〇〇〇强　二〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>戰費消耗…七·〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇圓二，三〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇圓</p>
<p>每日平均消耗……二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇圓　三，六〇〇，〇〇〇圓</p>
<p>日本飛機被毀者，已有七百多架。</p>
<p>雖然日本軍閥在國內一再或吹戰爭，用日蜜言語來欺騙他們的民衆，但日本國民對此次戰爭始終不感興趣，今年八月日本降軍少將高田曾在法西斯報章上發言，其中有一句晚：「日本國民對此次戰事的　不關懷，是件很可遺憾的事。」現在日本人民對軍　的侵略戰爭，已由　惡而生出强烈的反戰情緒，起初日本軍閥的侵華口號；是速戰速决，現在已改爲長期戰爭最近　坦曾說：「日本　被迫而準備戰事延長十年」。後來荒木貞夫又加以補充說：「戰爭延長到二十年或三十年在所不惜。」</p>
<p>目前日本國內反戰的怒潮，已到達極點，同時在華作戰的日本軍隊中，抗命及反戰的舉動常有發生·自殺　護變的事件也逐漸增多，前華中日軍司令松并所以奉召囘國，就是爲他督師無方，未能維其「皇軍」的軍紀所致，國內一　靑年爲廻避　役而逃亡失踪的，臨陣脫逃而被捕殺戮的，不知凡幾，現在日本軍部已將這批反戰脫逃的士兵，重　編配，看守在華北的逃兵營內。</p>
<p>戰士家屬對戰爭的苦悶及怨恨，已使日本軍部感到促不安，他的徵兵制已把政府的內政陷入泥沼，這對前綫軍隊的士氣，受到極大打擊。</p>

<p>然而，英國紳士們在遠東的如意之夢，終干在慕尼黑會議成立未久的—月中旬，被日本軍閥的砲聲所擊成粉碎了·日本軍閥悍然不顧一切，亦未出先通知英國，而逕自在華南登陸進攻廣州·英日的妥協聲浪，頓時沉于海底，代之而起的是英法在遠東的聯合陣綫，同時·英內閣于十月末旬通過了增强遠東艦隊的决議·張伯倫鑒于目前國際局勢之嚴重，决大規模擴充空軍與海出，海軍</p>

<p>— 宋斐如</p>
<p>美日兩國外交的衝突最近已到肉搏的地步，卽令不至於立刻激成美日的戰爭「其在太平洋上的經濟戰也將達到空前的高度·粵漢戰後，日本一方面宣言「九國公約」不適用於「東亞的新情勢」，一方面又自實際上封鎖中國的經濟權益歸自己獨占·美國遂於去年十月六日向日本提出嚴重的照會，十一月十八日雖即得到日本的復文，但仍充滿强詞奪理，美國大感不滿，故又於前日重再向日本提出第二次照會，其內容更爲具體，可以歸結出三點：（一）指出日方限制僑華美國人民的行爲與活動，已將日本的利益置於一優越的地位，其影響對於美僑的合法利益無疑的已予以差別待過；（二）指明這種限制辦法旣欠公允，且無根據，更遠反現行國際條約的規定；（三）申明美國人民與政府不能同意由第三國在華設立一種統治，獨斷獨行，攫取美方長久享受的機會均等與公平待遇的權利；（四一）聲明機會均等的基本原則，並非片面的聲明所得而取消，並否認日本有權在遠東建立『新秩序』。</p>
<p>美國第七十六屆議會已於本月三　三日開會，美國政府已擬將日本在中國佔領區內歧視美國商務的資料提出議會，準備採取積極對日加以經濟制裁的議案。現値日本侵略者獨吞中國的陰謀已漸慌亂，英美法蘇制裁日本的響勢已漸發生效力的今日，美國對日的態度及美國議會的决議，是很關重要的。我們願在這裏貢獻幾點意見，以供世界特別是美國人士參老。</p>
<p>（一）世界各國對日的經濟制裁，已到需要切實施行的地步，單只文件的照會或口頭的抗戰，已不能使執迷的日本侵略者醒悟了。目前日本對英美各國實施的經濟差別待遇正如美國第二次服曾所列，是：統制匯兌，强迫流通偽幣，擅自修改關稅，以及促進日方在華經濟獨占；美國政府也應以同樣辦法報復日本。我們相信美國政府是有意施行積極的辦法的。報紙宣傳羅斯福總統是否援用一九三〇年關稅法案中的附欵三三八條的規定要視美國公衆是否賦予權力，這就是說議會若議決美國可以實施這個條款對付日本，則美國政府立刻施行。美國人民索來同情中國抗戰最熱烈，並且自華南據點的廣州失陷後美國貿易也因香港之　立而喪失（去年一月至八月間美國經由香港的輸華出口貨佔總額十分之三，日本軍部機關報的「國民新聞」最近且又主張佔領杳港），此後能否保全在華權益已全視美國人民能否授予美國政府以實施報復手段之權。</p>
<p>（二）日本不但要獨佔中國的經濟權益，並且企圖更積極進出於拉丁美洲。」近年來日本向中南美各小國之進出已甚顯著，最近且如羅總統準備在議會宣讀的開幕演詞中所言，『三國（指日德意）並且聯合欲搜取拉丁美洲的市場與政治利益」。在美國現正精極圖謀「汎美』的密切結合，美洲各，小國皆倚　美國切實領導的今日，美國能否積極阻止德日侵略者侵犯美洲，卽可决定此後美洲整個團結能否成功，能否鞏固。</p>
<p>（三）英法及蘇聯已經準備和美國切實合作以制止遠東國際胃臉者的瘋狂·」英法最近幾次的會商，其範圍已經不只限於歐洲問題，或對付意大利的問題，同時對於遠東問題也深切加以件意，此後日本在華南更擴大的軍事行動，在客觀上更將促成英法的合作。英國已與美締結具有軍事政治意義的通商條約，其合作誠意可見。此外，如蘇聯與美國，不　因貿易關係日益密切而衝突之點較少，客觀上很有合作的可能，即蘇聯的主觀也很希望着蘇美合作實現。幾天前，蘇聯政府方面的某次議會上，會經討論過此後的外交方針，當時把與美國切實合作列爲最重的項目。再自蘇美對德日侵略者必須加以制正的共同性質，蘇聯與美國合作之殷切，是百分之百的可靠。蘇聯所顧慮者是美國執固於「孤立政策」，但美國輿論界已於借欵與中國時推斷將於今年修改孤立法爲重要的原因，則蘇美的合作就完全决於這次議會的態度了。</p>
<p>美國人民要求政府對日加以經濟制裁的熱誠，已於其言論（甚至有說美國因爲供給日本以各種軍火及軍需原料而資備政府無形中參加日本對華作戰）及行動（許多工人拒絕裝運日貨上岸及美貨上船，一般人民也拒買日貨）上看出，代表人民意志的議會正可以痛快直爽地授與總統施行制裁日本法規的權限，「對於任何國家岐視美國商業者，得對具入口貨物，徵收奇重稅則，並得禁止任何其他國家貨物，由該排美國家的輪船，裝載入口」；或甚至「對該排美國家，禁止其二切的貿易。」</p>
<p>我們所希望於美國議會者如此，同時，更盼望美國及各國的輿論，共同起來促進！</p>

<h3 id="c58">山西的游擊縣政近況 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>【本報吉縣通訊】山西的政治機構變更與改革，是始於蘆溝橋事變之初，當時綏靖署和省政府，爲了要使山西的政治機構，適合於戰時的需要，曾通令各縣當局，倘在×人進攻猛烈·或縣城淪陷的時候，縣長須領導着人民自衛隊，游擊隊，將縣政權移到鄉村，繼續執行縣長的職務，後來，雁北太原，臨汾先後失陷，隨着×人又在晉南晉西作大規模的軍事進攻，在這個時候，整個山西的縣政，都在鄉村中建立起來，實行其游擊的生活。</p>
<p>目前山西的縣政機　究竟是怎麼樣呢？它新的政治機　約可分爲下列各點：</p>
<p>（一）在晉北游擊區，縣政府已把總務，財政·建設，敎育四科，改區行政（第一科）經濟（第二科）軍事（第三科）民訓（第四科）四科將總務改爲行政科底下的一段·建設事項包括在軍事科內，敎育事項合併在民訓科內，這一改革，雷際上把各科都擴大了工作範圍。</p>
<p>（二）在第一行政區（五台區）各縣的動員委員會，已有些變更的地方，原日動委會，在行政機構不健全，民運比較落後的縣份，它是動員人力，物力，財力的一個半政權性的組織，但在政權建全的縣份，它却是一個障碍政權鞏固的機關，因此，目前山西在　一行政區，已由縣長聯席會議决定，將動委會中屬於縣政的任務部份，交還縣政府了</p>
<p>（三）其他各區動委會也有一些新的改變，第二戰區政治部曾規定縣政治機構，應以動委會形成集體領導爲原則，在縣動委會下設立政務，經濟，民運，武裝及敎育建設等五科，這樣，應用起來，更覺得簡單和靈活。</p>
<p>（四）爲了迅速糾正錯誤，及有效執行法令起見，各縣縣政府經常的召集各民衆團體代表。開行政檢會議，有時也有數縣縣畏同在一個地方召開，然而在權限上仍舊是極嚴格的劃分着，行政固然不能代替民運工作人員，民運也不能侵犯行政的權限·</p>
<p>（五）山西的第三和第六行政區·已實行區村長民選，民架代表參加區村動委會等，這許多，就是今天山西縣政的特點。</p>
<p>其次就是游擊縣政府所做的工作：</p>
<p>（一）游擊縣政府首要的工作是給了漢奸僞政權以澈底的摧毀，它不但澈底打擊偽維持會，并且爭取其中被×强迫作漢奸的人代我們服務，例如在第八行政區，某縣的維持會，經常的從山底供給我方食糧和重要消息，因此×人的　政權或者根本不能建立起來，或者建立起來而對它毫無用處，</p>
<p>（二）就是動員之廣大的民衆團體，聚在政府的周圍，如犧盟會，農救會，工救會，兒救會，婦救會等羣衆組識，今天不僅是政府法令的忠實擁護者和執行者，且能在政府領導下做到放步哨，佔察×情，檢查行人，進行除奸運動，制裁壞官，壞紳，及壞人，並開展游擊戰爭，協助軍隊襲擊×人。</p>
<p>（三）就是組織了强大的自　隊，及脫離生產的游擊隊，由於×人的焚燒，搶掠，屠殺，姦淫等暴行，使每個民衆都深切痛恨，有着政府去領導，民衆就如風起雲湧般自動組織起來，因此目前山西的自衛隊與游擊隊的數量，已計不勝　了。</p>
<p>（四）由於游擊縣政府的號召，軍民已開始了密切的合作，政府不僅發動民衆幫助軍隊作戰，并且還去召民衆幫助地方友軍解除困難，設法供給糧食，及其他軍需用品。各地民衆到處破壞×人交通，拆燬城牆堡，實行迅速空室淸野，致使×人在進攻某一區域或佔領一個城鄉，都受到極大的困難與阻撓。</p>
<p>（五）就是合理的負担，與減租減息的確實執行。</p>
<p>此外，目前山西的新縣政，除了上述各點以外，同時游擊縣縣長不但能英勇地作戰，并且能够十分吃苦，他們自動把生活費　到五元以下，他們在縣城陷落的時候，就在鄉村執行縣長的職務，有時甚至因×人的追迫，從這一個村莊轉移別一個村莊，但　不出縣境一步，他們更不肯放鬆每一個有利的機會擾亂×人，希助正規軍作戰。所以，現在山西一百零五縣當中，除　北二縣外　（現省府已通令五台區委派縣畏）其餘一百零二縣都建立起我們完整的縣政權，并且有七千餘個這樣的新縣長。</p>

<p>敎育之功能，在于成德達村，成德始于修已，達材所以善羣，換言之：以德智體三育培養靑年使進　適于集團生活，實爲敎育之主要標的。中國之言新敎育，數十年於茲，而成就之學人，仍少致用之才，書本之鑽研，究多無用之學，其於正德利用厚生之道，收效之微，不煩詳說。嘗以爲六藝復興之敎育，實爲今日常務之先。而昔樂之在教育上失其地位，則爲過去敎育失敗之結所在。救弊補偏，不容稍緩，改弦易轍，舍此莫由。</p>
<p>孔子泗之敎，六藝爲先，六藝之中，禮樂爲要。六藝之解凡二。其一曰：禮，樂，射，御，畫，數。顏習齋所謂禮以　五倫，樂以相五倫，射御書數則濟，此五倫者也。其次序之　先，可以　氏之說而明。其一曰：詩，書，禮，樂，易，春狄·詩書所以修已·禮樂所以善羣。易與春秋因天道以明人事之吉凶，陳世變以辨因應之得失，則爲用世之　。二說之中，皆言禮樂，其爲體用兼備之學，蓋無疑義。</p>
<p>周之盛也，文敎昌明，而敎育則融于藝術，孔子所以有『郁郁乎文哉』之嘆。泰伯篇有云：『興于詩，立于禮，成于樂』·學詩學禮，必待樂而完成，則樂敎之重要，更可推見。是以成均之敎，大司成，小司成，樂胥，皆主樂，」周官之制，大司樂，樂師，大胥，小胥，皆主學，（所謂『以治建國之學政」）亦猶　書命敎冑子，屬之典樂之虊，音樂之官，實掌敎育之事，則其時晉樂在敎育上之地位，可以想見其重要。內則：『十三學樂，誦詩，舞勺，成章學射御，舞象』。周之敎育，實以音樂植其始基。蓋所以涵泳性情，使得其中和，而仍利導其發揚蓬勃之生機，故學者致用成材，人知自奮也。</p>
<p>秦漢以後，雅樂失傳，制氏但紀其鼓舞鎰鏘，儒者不能明其意義，不特禮壞樂崩，六藝之敎，亦歸銷歇，魏晉之，世以學給口舌爲道；唐宋矯之，以讀書爲學道。於是學者呻其嗶，無裨世用。立國基礎，旣已動搖，國民性能，因以低落，馴致散漫，凌雜，放僻，萎靡，誰爲屬階？皆由樂敎之失其地位。行列不正，進退不齊，好惡，不平，流宕忘返。物之感人無窮·人之好惡無節，樂記所謂「物至逆化，滅大理而窮人欲」者也。於是有悖逆詐僞之心，有淫佚作亂之事，强者脅弱。衆者暴寡，知者詐愚，勇者苦怯，疾病不養，老幼孤獨，不得其所，頹波所至，洱可目心！</p>
<p>原禮樂之用，在于善羣，羣之性能「基于組織。組強之要，一曰堅强，二日生動，堅强所以恃續其生存，生動所以促進其發展·所謂『安上治民，莫善于禮，移風易俗、莫善于樂，禮具安定之力，安定則組織堅强，樂富發揚之機　發揚故組織生動，相須爲用，相輔以行，禮明樂備，故能自强不息·但禮自外作，樂由心生，禮之用在軌範個體于共同規律之中，樂之用在表現個體于集體動作之內，故禮不免于勉强而行之，樂則庶幾安而行之者。樂主于動，抑揚抗壓，進退疾徐，聲容並茂，則悅懌易從，興會　舉，則自然中節。故發揚蹈厲，可以振意志之萎靡；綴兆行列，可以治身心之散漫；「進旅退旅」，可以理事物之凌雜；安樂中和，可以正性情之放僻。中國文化，亘五千年，雖無往不復，光景常新，然樂敎不修，則過抑生機，將趨衰老，民族之危，不容忽視！</p>
<p>禮敎單行之弊，其一則空氣嚴肅，易流板滯，保守之趣向居多，則進取之勇氣不足。譬之李節，秋冬之歛藏，終不如春夏之生機暢達。古人瞽宗所詔，春誦夏弦，秋冬則敎以書禮，亦見其順應自然，因時施敎·文化之與人生·過程往往相似，中年以什，更事已多，經驗則繼長增高，創造則不輕嘗試·我國文化之已及中年，自爲事實，則不可不恢復固有，以復其天眞，迎頭趕上，以自强不息·記曰：「天地之道，寒暑不時朋疾·敎者，吾民寒暑也，敎不時則傷世」·故因時制宜·促自力之更生·音樂在敎育上，實爲救時之藥。</p>
<p>偏重禮敎之弊，其二則形式雖在，精義不存，重書本而忽應用，認空讀之義理訓詁，爲形而上之道，輕實用之射御書數，爲形而下之技·其結果則智育無以利用厚生，體育無以任重致遠，卽德育亦修齊治平之功少，而著書立說之功多·白面書生，菽麥不辨，用以治人，則未能自治，期以養人，則無由自養，執干戈以衛社稷，則文武之途久分，更無自衛衛人之力。推原其故·則習靜之時，多于習動，實行之力，用于學文，學者安得不僅存奄奄待盡之身？天下安得不畢呈暮氣沉沉之象？針其膏肓，起其廢疾，舍復興樂教，實別無途徑可尋。</p>
<p>音樂之事，器與聲，容，其器則鐘，鼓，管，磬，羽，籥，干，戚，其聲則歌，具容則舞。聽其聲音，意志得廣；習其俯仰，容貌得莊；行其綴兆，要其節奏，行列得正，進退得齊。其爲敎一，而德智體三育成寓其中，移風易俗，陶鑄性情，則德育好焉；手之舞之，足之蹈之，則體育存焉，而引商刻羽，分技無失，五音七律，旋相爲宮！「同律度量衡」，以之爲標準，「協時月政日」以之爲根據，則智育亦俘焉。而其妙用，則統同合愛，親附萬民。整齊一致之步調，和諧親切之聲音，流通精神。動　，血脉，養中和少德，救氣質之偏</p>
<p>當建國大業發軔之時，音樂敎育，實足以蕩滌瑕穢，孚甲新機。</p>
<p>子　之論音聲，凡舉鐘，石，絲，竹，鼓鼙五者，而曰君子聽鐘聲，則思武臣；聽磐聲，則思死封疆之臣；聽琴瑟之聲，則思志義之臣；豐竿笙肅官之聲，則思畜聚之臣；聽鼓鼙之聲，則思將帥之臣。足知發揚蹈厲之音，足以激志氣，干戚羽旄之舞，足以講武備，是以小我之詩作，而秦之霸業日大，馬賽之　興，而法之革命成功，抗戰期間，謀所以振奮人心，激昂士氣，音樂敎育，實具最大之功能。</p>
<p>香樂敎育之功能，如上所陳，可以恢復六藝立國之基礎，可以　救國民道德之駿夷，可以挽囘民旗衰老之危機，可以喚起實用科學之注重，可以收團結精神之效，以榭建頗織基，可以　同仇敵愾之心，以應抗戰之需要；則當二期抗戰開始之時，建國敎育發軔之際，提偏之宜急切可知，地位之屬重要可見。、其感人也至深，故其收效也至速，「暮鼓晨　，發人深省」，宗敎家固已先我知之抑且利用之矣·民族動力之增強其可不于此求之耶！</p>

<p>【美聯社東京四日電】新閣員之人選、雖未發表、但各方猜測、大致平沼騏一郎將任首相、結城豐太郎任藏相、鹽野季彥任內相、按平密會歷充西園寺內閣之司法次官司法大臣及樞密院副議長</p>
<p>【中央社重慶四日電】東京外訊、日皇今午召見宮內大臣湯淺倉平垂詢對于新閣人選意見、湯淺乃請日皇上予與西圍寺公元老交換意見后、再行覆奏、湯淺子今日下午二時離東京、拜訪西園寺公、今晚九時已返京、屆時彼巳直接入宮、根據西園寺公之意見、推薦組閣人選、據續到消息、日皇已召平沼進宮、面令阻閣、</p>
<p>【本報上海四日專電】東京訊、日內閣改組、醞釀已久、今晨九時在首相官那召開之緊急閣議中、突急轉直下、參加者有近衛首相以次各閣僚、討論約一小時、結果决定內閣總辭職、散會後、近衛卽進宮覲見日皇、親遞辭表、同時米內及板垣、分別召開海陸兩省首嘰部會議、海軍方面、出席首有海相米內、次官山本、軍務局長井上、人事局長淸水等、陸軍方面、出席者有陸相板垣、次官東條、軍務局長中村、人事局長阿南、經理局長石川、參謀本部亦派次官多田列席、結果、兩省一致同意、對於繼任首相問題、派遣聯絡員密切聯繫、同時由板垣陸相謁見參謀總長閑院宮親皇、報吿內閣辭職經過、近衛內閣瓦解後、繼任首相人選以平沼樞密院長呼聲最高、目前各方視線、咸集西園寺老公東京之行、及今明召集之重臣會議云、　　近衛辭職宣言</p>

<h3 id="e1">Analysis of the Japanese Coup and Its Trends <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>According to today's newspapers, the Konoe Cabinet, which had been struggling for days, finally submitted its resignation, and it is said that the Emperor has approved it. Minister of the Imperial Household, Yuasa, will visit Duke Saionji in Okitsu tonight. After returning to Tokyo at 9:00 PM, the successor to form the cabinet and the cabinet members can be determined. The question now is, will Konoe remain in office for another reshuffle? Or will someone else be chosen to form a new cabinet? There are varying speculations from all sides, but in our observation, Konoe may not do it again this time. Because the current problems are, firstly, to suppress political parties and parliament so that this year's huge budget and the National Mobilization Law Implementation Bill can be passed by parliament; and secondly, to bravely organize a new one-country, one-party party. Japan now objectively needs a more fascist government, but Konoe can no longer cope with this situation, and he is unwilling to serve as the leader of the new party. The fascist military no longer wants to use him, as can be seen from Suetsugu's strong demand that Konoe resolutely dissolve the parliament. However, the successor may not necessarily be Suetsugu, the leader of the fascists, to form a cabinet. The reasons are: (1) Suetsugu's sharp edge is too exposed, and his reputation is not enough; (2) Although Suetsugu is ostensibly the leader of the fascists, he is not supported by the elders, senior officials, and financial groups. Today's Japanese political situation still needs the coordination of financial, political, and military forces. In addition, although people speculate that Terauchi, Yuasa, and Minami and others may be the successors to the prime minister, they are even less qualified than Suetsugu. The more hopeful person is probably Hiranuma, because he has a higher reputation, and he has the support of the right-wing fascists in peacetime, and it is easier to exert influence in coordinating the military, political, and financial circles. As for the departure and retention of his cabinet members, according to my speculation, Ikeda, Suetsugu, Yonai, Kido and others may have to resign, while Itagaki, Arita, and Araki and others may return to power again. It can be asserted that the Japanese government will actively promote fascist rule to the extent possible under the conditions of coordinating the forces of various factions.</p>
<p>However, many problems lying before the Japanese government cannot be easily overcome.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Konoe is busy running around to senior officials, cabinet members, political parties, and financial groups, but in the end, he still cannot reconcile the internal conflicts of the cabinet, and still cannot avoid resigning en masse. His movements are worthy of our attention. At the moment when the 74th session of the Japanese Parliament is about to be convened, when Japan is embarking on the grand work of "reforming the Far East," especially in these days when Mr. Wang Jingwei's actions and remarks are bizarre, we should have an analysis of the serious situation of the Japanese political situation and the latent contradictions that follow. Here, we specifically analyze it to see the trend of the turbulent Japanese political situation in the future:</p>
<p>(1) The reorganization of the Japanese cabinet in the future can only change people but not strengthen its function, and it will only deepen the contradictions in the political circles. It seems impossible for the Japanese government to change and hope to have another major reinforcement as in May last year, because Japan's war of aggression against China has reached the "next stage," which is completely different from the previous situation. At this time, the internal contradictions in Japan are not only greatly complicated, but also various contradictions are gradually deepening to the point where they cannot be reconciled. For example, the contradiction between military expansion and financial contraction, the contradiction between monopolizing Chinese rights and interests and adjusting diplomacy, the contradiction between ending the war against China and disturbing the order in China, the contradiction between developing Chinese resources and the shortage of Japanese capital, and even the contradiction between wooing Germany and Italy and pleasing Britain and the United States, are the most serious problems at present.</p>
<p>(2) At present, the consciousness of the Japanese military and the national financial resources have embarked on the development of the "previous situation." Although Japanese Vice Minister of the Army, Tojo, demanded that military industry manufacturers double their efforts in production and declared that they were prepared to fight China and the Soviet Union at the same time, and Konoe's declaration on December 22 also stated: "The Japanese government has decided to continue its military operations in order to completely eliminate the anti-Japanese Kuomintang government," the prudent advocates of the Privy Council seriously questioned Konoe: "When will the war end? Where will it end?" Their worries and opposition to the continuation and expansion of the war are expressed in words. The financial community also responded to the warmongers with the trend of stock market crashes. Expanding the war requires more military spending. The general accounting of Japan's budget for the next year has increased a lot compared with this year. Calculated together with the military expenses for the invasion of China and the administrative expenses for the occupied territories, it is close to 10 billion yuan. At a time when the ability to digest public bonds has reached saturation and the import surplus has increased sharply, I do not know where Japan will seek such a huge source of financial resources. If Article 11 of the National Mobilization Law is seriously implemented, and even private property is requisitioned, this is not tolerated by capitalist society, and it is even less tolerated by the financial groups who sit high on the ruling chair. I don't know what magic Konoe has to regulate this contradiction? Completely sacrifice small and medium-sized industries to preserve large industries, especially military industry families? Japan's economic structure is bound to collapse completely.</p>
<p>(3) Judging from the recent situation in the Far East, Japan subjectively wants to monopolize China's rights and interests, but objectively Japan seems to have to adjust its diplomatic relations with various countries. Japan's arrogant declarations and attempts to monopolize China's rights and interests since the post-Guangdong-Hankou War have hit hard nails from Britain and the United States, and Britain and the United States have responded with practical measures to aid China and contain Japan. Therefore, Japan not only has calmed down the military operations in South China, but also Konoe's declaration on December 20, which comprehensively expressed Japan's current China policy, also reiterated his deceptive rhetoric, saying: "Regarding Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Japan has no intention of monopolizing China's economic rights, and it does not want to ask China to restrict the economic interests of third countries," and so on. In terms of Japanese-Soviet relations, the Konoe government also feels helpless. Not only has the Japanese army's attempt to attack the northwest and cut off international transportation routes not made any progress, but it has also recently had to busy mobilizing a large army to go out and set up defenses. Not only has the so-called revision of the fishery treaty strongly proposed by the Soviet Union not been signed by the Soviet Union, but it has also been embarrassed by Litvinov's question about the anti-communist agreement challenging the Soviet Union, and had to sigh and say: Wait until next spring to negotiate! Sincerely and sincerely reconcile with Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union? The ambition to conquer China does not allow it, and the military does not agree. Is it possible to play "fire" with the above-mentioned countries, but it is strictly restricted by its strength. I don't know how the Japanese government will enable "military and financial authorities to work together with those responsible for diplomacy"?</p>
<p>(4) Japan's current policy towards China is to end the war and use means to disrupt China at the same time. On the one hand, it attempts to end the Sino-Japanese War, as reported by the Japanese newspapers that Konoe is running around to "terminate the process of the war against China as soon as possible." On the other hand, in its recent declaration, it stated that the Japanese government has decided to continue military operations. This is not surprising. The former refers to the Sino-Japanese War, and the latter is obviously drawing a cause for the Chinese civil war. Japan's conspiracy is to replace the Sino-Japanese War with the Chinese civil war (see, "Japan's Reply to Peace Advocates" in the February 6th issue of the newspaper). The reason why it is eager to put Wu Peifu forward is precisely for this reason. However, Japan's attempt has completely fallen into distress. If the Japanese army does not withdraw from Chinese territory, China's war of resistance against Japan will not end. The situation in China today is no longer comparable to what it was before. The common hatred of the enemy outweighs other desires, and Japan's attempt is not easy to achieve. Even if there are Wang Jingwei's crazy words and deeds recently, in fact, they still cannot affect the overall situation of China's war of resistance.</p>
<p>(5) Japan is currently concentrating on developing Chinese resources to remedy its own anemia. Even the warmonger Itagaki stated in a conversation after the Guangdong-Hankou War: "From now on, the policy in the occupied areas of China has changed from military firstism to security firstism." However, the first condition for developing resources is a huge amount of capital. Japan's own capital is not sufficient, and it is unwilling to allow Britain, the United States, and France to invest freely, so the development work is bound to hit a wall. The failure to decide on the development funds in Central China is a clear confirmation of this. The Japanese government may apply Article 11 of the National Mobilization Law to prohibit capital from investing in industrial sectors that the Japanese government considers non-urgent, and force financial institutions to invest in emergency projects. However, the opening of new enterprises in China is no more urgent than the relief of bankrupt enterprises in Japan. In recent months, has the issue of relief for small and medium-sized industries in Japan not become a major issue in the Japanese political arena? The Japanese government is preoccupied with one thing and loses sight of the other. I don't know how it will solve this contradiction?</p>
<p>(5) Since the "September 18th Incident," Japan's wooing of its two accomplices, Germany and Italy, has indeed been very rapid. Germany and Italy are also happy to collude, so from the Tripartite Anti-Communist Pact to the Cultural Agreement, and even the brewing military triangular alliance, German artillery was exchanged for soybeans in the three northeastern provinces. From Hitler's recognition of the puppet Manchuria to the Japanese recognition of Germany's trade privileges in North China. (According to the Osaka Mainichi on November 25) Italy is also following the same steps. The German newspapers even celebrated, saying: "Foreign trade with China should be completely changed, and the three countries of Japan, Germany and Italy should be in a controlling position, and the existing forces of various countries should be overthrown." The People's Observer, the organ newspaper of the National Socialist Party, even stated: "Tokyo has recently talked about Chinese iron ore, and all those under Japanese control can be jointly developed by Italy." Japan's temptation to Germany and Italy has been extremely strong, and Germany and Italy have also greatly supported Japan. Germany secretly disturbed Ukraine. The arrogance of Goebbels' speech, and even Italy's threat to France and its restraint on Britain, are all manifestations of the collusion and progress of the fascist group. However, this practice of Japan's conflicts with the need to ease Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union. If the Japanese aggressors do not have the determination to expand international adventures, as the Japanese anti-war writer Mr. Kajide said, "they may become tougher in the future, completely seal off the coast with the navy, cut off international highways with the army, and finally declare war on China" (see the newspapers on December 27), then the Japanese government will never be able to break this diplomatic deadlock. No matter whether Konoe gets back on his tongue or someone else forms a cabinet, this problem cannot be solved.</p>
<p>1939 has arrived, and the difficulties of the Japanese political situation are increasing year by year. The 74th session of the parliament is the first to lie in front of us. I don't know how the new Japanese government will overcome these heavy reefs?</p>

<h3 id="e2">Traveling in Nanchang in the Dark Night <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Fen</p>
<p>I never thought that our footprints would be left in Nanchang.</p>
<p>On that night in late autumn when the night wind gently swayed the sky full of stars, our family of refugees was carried by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to an unfamiliar city. This is Nanchang, this is a new city; the tall station stands before our eyes, and we stepped into this city for the first time, rejoicing on one side, but also inexplicably afraid. Rejoicing that we were able to safely get out of the car; but afraid, how are we going to live in this unfamiliar city? However, what made us more unbearable than joy and fear was fatigue! Although it only takes a day or two to travel from Tonglu, Zhejiang to Nanchang in normal times, we spent more than a week. If we dragged on the itinerary for half a sightseeing trip, it would of course be a very leisurely journey, but we were all anxious, starving and freezing. In the rapids of the Zheng River, we sat on a small boat, sweating profusely, watching the boatmen pull and support the poles in the rapids, and several times we were frightened and trembling, which was not timidity. This water trip was really too dangerous. At the Longyou train station, we sat for three nights, unable to catch a train, watching the trains rush by, all so-called passenger cars that were already crowded with wounded soldiers. Even if they stopped by the platform, we still had no way to hitch a ride. In this way, we actually stayed in a small thatched house for three nights. Good luck finally gave us a ride on the train on the fourth night, and on the train, we sat so miserably for another night, so when we arrived in Nanchang, we really couldn't bear the fatigue we had gained along the way.</p>
<p>As soon as we got off the train, the first thing we did was to find a hotel. However, dark alleys, unfamiliar roads, and such a late hour, where could we find one? I took the luggage out of the station, holding the smallest child, and called the family to get on the rickshaw, and let them pull us to wherever they wanted. After passing through a quiet field, we saw a neat avenue, and the first hotel sign that caught our eyes was "Hua Zhong". Okay, let's go in and ask. The accountant replied that there were no rooms, and said that all the hotels were already full. I began to worry again. Were we going to sleep on the streets? Although I heard that people who encountered this kind of disaster were everywhere, we had never encountered it. And we had old people and children, how could we bear to sleep on the streets? A shiver ran through my body, and I couldn't help but tremble slightly. Looking at the old people and children piled up with luggage and everything in the car outside the door, I couldn't help but plead pitifully with the short and fat accountant. The accountant understood my background, and unexpectedly helped me find a small room. It was a room they occupied themselves, and it was never rented out. Now, they only charged me a very low rent to let us stay here. We were really grateful for this friendship. I didn't have time to look at the room, and hurriedly ran outside to call them to get off the car, and deposited the luggage in the storage room next to the accounting room. I excitedly supported the old and carried the young, and followed the hotel clerk through the narrow room, not caring about the narrowness, and not waiting for the beds to be enough, I opened two quilts and spread them out. The children had not washed their faces, and were already snoring and falling asleep, uttering not very clear dreams.</p>
<p>That night, we all slept very sweetly, without looking back on the past, or looking forward to the future, just sleeping sweetly; because the fatigue of the past few days had really tormented us enough.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Navigation Conference Held in Jinhua. Maritime Transport in Eastern Zhejiang Will Be Effectively Adjusted. Direct Shipping Between Shanghai and Ningbo Has Been Wired to the Military Commission for Approval. 34 Ships Approved to Navigate the Ou River. Haimeda, Tangbei, Tangsai Shanghai-Ningbo Intermodal Transport <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] The Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group convened a navigation conference to adjust maritime transport in eastern Zhejiang. The case ended on the 28th. The results of the meeting will be announced within days. There is also talk of hope for the resumption of direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo. After re-registration, ships sailing in Wenzhou have been approved by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Command. The province of Zhejiang will moderately allow the export of tung oil and tea. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Navigation Conference Ends Successfully</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Tenth Army Group convened a navigation conference in Jinhua on the 27th to effectively adjust maritime transport in eastern Zhejiang, inviting the military chiefs in charge and relevant parties to participate in the discussion. Yesterday at 6 p.m., the shipping department of Lihe Foreign Firm in this city received a telegram from Ningbo reporting that the Jinhua navigation conference ended on the 28th. Mr. Shi, the representative of the Ningbo Shipping Industry Association, and Zhang Guilin, the deputy commander of the Ningbo Garrison, returned to Ningbo after the meeting. The results of the meeting were quite satisfactory. A detailed discussion has been held on the shipping in eastern Zhejiang, and the detailed measures will be announced within days.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Can Be Expected to Resume Direct Shipping</p>
<p>The reporters of the Modern News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the direct shipping route between Shanghai and Ningbo has been banned by order of the headquarters of the Tenth Army Group. All parties have repeatedly telegraphed to request its opening, but it has not been approved due to the orders of the Military Commission. The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai and relevant parties believe that the Yong River is now an important port for the import and export of local products from Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces. If it is closed for a long time, it will have a profound impact on the sales of local products and the rural economy. Therefore, they have re-stated their reasons and telegraphed to the Military Commission and the headquarters of the Tenth Army Group, requesting approval for its resumption. It is now learned that the case has been discussed in detail at the Jinhua navigation conference, and opinions have been signed and submitted to the Military Commission for approval. It is likely that it will be possible to resume it.</p>
<p>34 Ships Approved to Navigate the Ou River</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai shipping companies received a notice from the Wenzhou Shipping Industry Association, which stated that according to the instructions of the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Command, the ship registration forms previously submitted by the association have been reviewed and approved for registration. The approved ships include Bo, Deping, Anping, Anna, Hailong, Peile, Baoli, Moufu, Haiyang, Haicheng, Heguang, Niuzhuang, Lisheng, Baobei, Shifei, Sheng Luosha, Sanma, Chongqing, Dade, Minhe, Feiyun, Meifa, Meida, Fade, Wanguo, Xinde, Kangshayi, Tanglu, Tangsai, Zhiduo, Keleming, Shenganna, Luqin, and Hailer, a total of 34 ships. In addition to the registration forms, they are stored and forwarded separately. Please inform them accordingly.</p>
<p>Unapproved Ships Are Strictly Prohibited from Sailing</p>
<p>The re-registration of these ships was instructed by this headquarters in the instruction No. 292, dated December 2. The registration period is from December 3 to December 23. The registration period has now expired. All ships that have not been approved for registration this time are not allowed to enter or exit. However, ships that were registered in the previous registration but have not been approved this time, and are in transit or have been imported, are allowed to enter and exit once to be consistent with the facts. Please instruct all shipping companies to comply with this order. In addition to notifying them separately, this order is jointly issued to the manager for notification. The reporter learned that the above-mentioned 34 ships include those sailing in the inner harbor.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province Moderately Permits the Export of Tea, Tung Oil, and Tea are the main export products of our country. Every year, the sales to foreign countries account for the top spot in foreign trade. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, tung oil has been an important raw material for military use, so the military authorities in Zhejiang Province have prohibited its export. The transportation and sales of tea leaves also require the purchase of foreign exchange before they can be shipped to Shanghai. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed to the authorities in Zhejiang Province, requesting them to moderately allow the export of tung oil and tea under the principle of not hindering military affairs. Zhejiang Province has ordered the Trade Adjustment Office to handle the matter in accordance with the Ministry's intentions.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger and Cargo Intermodal Transport is Implemented Again. After Shanghai South prohibited direct shipping, a certain Bao ship of the American Huamei Company, which runs the Taizhou-Ningbo line, and the Tangbei ship of the same company, which runs the Shanghai-Taizhou line, handle passenger and cargo intermodal transport. The unified cabin fare is 8 yuan, the room cabin fare is 16 yuan, and the official cabin fare is 20 yuan. The Meda ship of the Portuguese American Company, which runs the Taizhou-Ningbo line, and the Haifu ship of the German Lihe Foreign Firm, which runs the Shanghai-Taizhou line, handle passenger and cargo intermodal transport. The unified cabin fare is 8 yuan, the bunk is 12 yuan, and the room cabin fare is 16 yuan. The Shanghai-Ningbo intermodal transport has begun to be sold.</p>
<p>A Pilot Office is Established in Langzhou</p>
<p>In view of the fact that Wenzhou is at the forefront of national defense, and in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the blockade and maintain sea traffic during the blockade, the Wenzhou Garrison Commander specially organized the Wenzhou Pilot Office to handle pilot affairs in this port. In the future, ships entering and leaving the port must report to the office for guidance before they are allowed to sail. Weng Jiqing has now been appointed as the director of the office. The office is located at No. 20 Siying Lane, Wenzhou, and the branch office is located at Yueqing Huaguan. As for the pilots, they will be selected from among those who have held important positions in navigation in accordance with the promulgated pilot examination regulations, in order to show fairness and solemnity. The office has been officially established.</p>
<p>Large Ships with "Ding" Not Approved Yet</p>
<p>The Nana, Shantay, Haifu, Tangbei, and Gaodeng ships that sail the Shanghai-Taiwan line, and the Meifa ship that sails the Shanghai-Wenzhou line and Wandinghai, have not been approved for resumption of sailing since the Ningbo City Defense Commander notified them to stop sailing to Dinghai. Therefore, they are temporarily dedicated to sailing the Shanghai-Taiwan line. Meifa directly sails the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. As for the Meda and Tangsai ships on the Taiwan-Ningbo line, they have requested the Standing Bureau to make accommodations for fuel problems, but no reply has been received. However, it is heard that the Tenth Army Group has decided to follow the previous order and not make accommodations for the two ships to load coal in Shanghai, as it violates the ban on direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo.

<p>— Chen Zhixiong</p>
<p>Yuanling—Huang County October 18th. This morning, before the dogs barked and before dawn, I got up. The weather was cool, and the wind blew in my face, making me shiver. The waiter had already prepared tea and water, inviting guests to have a meal. After finishing the meal, I got on the bus. It was exactly eight o'clock, the bus drove very slowly, and it was very stable, without any bumps. Yuanling is also known as Chenzhou, famous for producing cinnabar. According to the locals, Chenzhou talismans are good at treating people's illnesses, but the technique has been lost to this day, whether it is true is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>The bus left Yuanling soon, and had to climb a mountain again. When going down the mountain, it was necessary to cross the water. After about 20 minutes, the bus arrived at Suhanpu, and then climbed up the mountain again, first large and then small. At this time, several workers were quarrying and opening roads. Mountain stones were piled up in the middle of the road, and the bus could not move forward. After the road workers moved the stones away, it could continue to drive, but half an hour had passed. The bus went up and down the mountain for a long time before reaching Chuanxi Post. The mountains became more winding and dangerous, so I dared not drive fast. At 9:25, the bus arrived at Chenxi, and coal miners were mining nearby. From Yuanling to here, it is a total of 65 kilometers. This place is 446 kilometers away from Changsha. From here to Zhijiang, it is still necessary to travel 109 kilometers. After the bus arrived at Chenxi River, it crossed the river again. This place has clear mountains and waters, and the scenery is pleasant. After crossing the river, it arrived at Huatangping. At 10:15, the bus started again. Looking down the mountain, the scenery was quiet and secluded, without any worldly atmosphere. After arriving at Baliping, there was a small stream flowing through it, the water was turquoise, and it went straight up along the Caojiaxi River. The scenery along the way was like a painting. There were green mountains in front and green waters on the side. When I arrived at Huang County, it was already after 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I found a hostel to stay in. The military police checked at night, and I rested very early after dinner. I heard from passers-by that a car going to Guiyang was robbed of more than 3,000 yuan on the way. We all had a sense of vigilance.</p>
<p>We stopped at Dongshigu in Huang County and stayed at a small hotel next to the station. Because the bus to Guiyang departs from the West Railway Station, we crossed the river after breakfast the next morning. At that time, the fog was very heavy, and people could not be seen within a short distance, and the weather was very cold. After crossing the river, I learned that the bus had not arrived yet, and I had to stay in Huang County for one or two days before I could leave.</p>
<p>Huang County is divided into two cities, new and old. The new city is three or four miles away from the station. I and three others, including Mr. Zhang, went to the new city. After passing the wooden bridge, we went to Zhongshan Street. The so-called new city only has one street, where foreign goods stores and vegetable markets are located. The road is quite clean, and there are many pedestrians. The market is full of pomelos and persimmons. You can buy three pomelos for one dime. Every family dries peppers in front of their doors. I saw a mother feeding her child with county ginseng rice. I heard the market people say that they still have this thing at home, dry it, and use it to help with meals. People in the market, regardless of men or women, wear black or white cloth on their heads. I heard that the people's superstitious customs are very strong.</p>
<p>Huang County—Huangping October 20th. There are very few buses from Huang County to Huangping, and there are many people. Without a division, a certain gentleman suggested drawing lots. I and Mr. Zhang both drew to go. I packed my luggage that night and got up at 6 o'clock. When I arrived at the station, it was already crowded, and there was no room for those who arrived later. After the bus left Huang County, it climbed up the mountain. The first stop was Mao Yupu, which is the border between Hunan and Guizhou. The second stop was Nanning Fort, and the third stop was Shanmudun. After a short drive, the bus arrived at Yuping, which is famous for producing bridges, especially the cigarette pipes made there, which are unusually elegant. The materials used are all thin bamboo, and the carving is quite exquisite. Those who pass by this place will buy them to keep as souvenirs. The sentences carved by Xiao Shang are mostly "Only people who know the sound of the flute know," or "On a moonlit night, it is good to listen to Xiao Shi," "Only jade-like people know the fairy sound" and other sentences. The bus stopped in Yuping for about four or five minutes before leaving. After climbing two mountains, it arrived at Dongjing Bridge. Then it climbed the mountain again. The mountain road was winding and dangerous. Sometimes the bus drove to a very high and deep place, with no obstacles on either side. Looking down at the deep mountains and valleys, they were all thousands of feet below. The bus was driving in it, and it was very necessary to be cautious, especially when turning corners. When the bus arrived at Sansui Station, it stopped for a while, and everyone got off to buy sweet potato flour to fill their stomachs. Soon, it arrived at Magun. After passing Xiangshui, it arrived at Panshan. The top of the mountain stood in the clouds, thousands of feet above sea level. The bus circled around the mountain, and everyone sat upright, not moving around. Looking out from the window, the mountains glared, and the figures below the mountain were like ants, almost indistinguishable. After passing Xiangziling, it arrived at Zhenyuan. Then it climbed the mountain again and passed Yingxian Temple. Looking far away at thousands of mountains and ridges, the peaks looked at each other. The mountain road was rugged, and it circled to Goose Wings, which is the highest point of the mountain. Looking far away, the river flowed quietly down. The bus entered through Dongmen, climbed Goose Wings, and then wound down the mountain. The scenery can be called amazing. After the bus passed Liujiazhuang and Shibing, the speed increased. It passed Gandiping, Lanqiao, and Chatingao in a hurry, and arrived at Huangban, it was already after 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Huangping City is located high on the mountain. I stayed at the Qiandong Hotel. After a short rest, I went to the city to sightsee. I was very disappointed. There was not a single complete house in the city. There was nothing like a restaurant or department store. There was not even a canned food to buy. As for the public education center, it was unusually simple, which shows the low level of public knowledge.</p>

<p>Before the war, Bianxi Yarn Factory (30,000 Yarn Spindles and 700 Looms) and Kurashiki Yarn Waste (30,000 Spindles and 750 Looms), which were planned to be established by Japanese businessmen in Tianjin, are now already in operation.</p>
<p>Since August 13th, almost all factories in the suburbs of Shanghai have been destroyed, but Yufeng Yarn Factory, a Japanese-owned factory in Yangshupu, was spared. Internal and external yarn factories in the public concession area are even more intact. Now, the destroyed factories have also been roughly repaired and expanded. Therefore, according to a survey by the Japanese Yarn Factory Association in China, at the end of August this year, the operating rate of each Japanese-owned yarn factory in Shanghai is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e11">Further Control of China's Flour <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Japanese goods followed the army and were sold in large quantities in China. The prosperity of flour imports into China is particularly noteworthy. However, in recent months, there has been a sharp decline. Taking the import of Japanese flour into "North China" as an example, imports in March this year were more than 960,000 bags, which decreased to 720,000 bags in May, and only 130,000 bags in September. There was no improvement in October. Why is this? According to the Japanese, there are two reasons for this:</p>
<p>[1] The sharp decrease in the domestic flour inventory in Japan and the decline in rice and wheat production this year.</p>
<p>[2] Australian flour prices are much lower than Japanese flour prices, so exports to "North China" have been increasing. For example, in April and May this year, there were 500,000 bags of imports, and in September, the record of 1 million bags was broken. It can be said that Japan's position has been replaced by Australia.</p>
<p>These two points are indeed facts, but in our opinion, the most important thing is the extremely chaotic result of Japan's trade policy towards China. Because Japan has forcibly pulled "North China" into its so-called "Yen Zone," Japanese goods exported to China are no longer included in foreign exchange income. This has greatly affected its ability to purchase military resources from third countries. Therefore, the Japanese government has had to come forward to limit exports to China of goods sold to other countries, and flour is one of them. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Overseas Chinese Should Rise Up Vigorously; The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Fund-raising Committee Actively Promotes the One-Dollar Movement; The Results of the Event Are Not Good, Only More Than 1,000 Yuan Raised; Committee Members Immediately Donate and Send Letters to Various Organizations to Promote <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Fund-raising Committee held a meeting of the standing committee at 3 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Chairman Li Xingzhou, Vice Chairman Huang Maolin, Committee Members Lei Yinshun, Lu Guomian, Chen Zhongchi, Zhou Xingchi, Cao Fuzhao, Su Chaolian, Huang Lianfu, Liu Jingqing, Liu Yuyun, Xi Peikun, Wu Shipu, Pan Fan'an, Xin Yuming, Li Bingsen, and Jian Chinan, totaling more than 20 people. After the meeting, Secretary Cao Xueyu reported on the committee's affairs: (1) To accept the case of rescuing refugees in Yubei, send a letter to the Yubei Relief Committee to inquire about the disaster situation, and send a letter to the Panyu Chamber of Commerce to inquire about how to provide relief, and then consider allocating funds. (2) To report on the one-dollar debt repayment movement, which has received a total of 1,002 yuan in national currency in recent days. After the various reports were completed,</p>
<p>Chairman and Vice Chairman Actually Resign; Chairman Li Xingzhou and Huang Maolin took the excuse to leave. However, the committee members present unanimously agreed that the one-dollar debt repayment movement, which was accepted and carried out by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, should be promoted by the committee. Now that it has been held for several days, the results are still not good, and we should find ways to raise funds. First, Cao Fuzhao suggested that we should follow the example of promoting national salvation bonds, and send teams to solicit donations. The committee members expressed their opinions one after another. Because the chairman and vice chairman had both resigned, it was like a group of dragons without a leader. Therefore, Lei Yinshun was elected as the interim chairman to continue the discussion, in order to obtain a good method for promotion.</p>
<p>Lei Yinshun Gave a Generous Speech; Lei Yinshun stood up and clarified the significance of promoting the one-dollar debt repayment movement, saying that since the committee has followed the approval of the board of directors and sent letters to all industries and chambers of commerce in Hong Kong to carry out their own activities, whether the results will be good in the future is not predictable. However, in theory, since this chamber of commerce is in a leading position, it should take the lead in initiating and implementing it, so as to avoid outside criticism. As for how much to donate, it is not a problem. Secondly, there are many members of the chamber of commerce. If we hold individual donations from members, the amount should not be small. If we do not do this, it will be the same as all industries and chambers of commerce in Hong Kong and this chamber of commerce. How can we achieve good results? I hope everyone will express their great opinions.</p>
<p>The Committee Members Present Expressed Their Deep Approval; After the chairman finished asking, Xin Yuming, Lu Guomian, Chen Zhongchi, and others expressed their opinions one after another. They all agreed that the one-dollar debt repayment movement can enhance national strength and create a new international perspective. The committee is in a leading position and should work hard to promote its success. Therefore, it was decided (1) to immediately recognize donations and ask representatives of all industries to actively carry out the movement; (2) to send a detailed letter from the manager of the chamber of commerce on the important significance of the one-dollar debt repayment movement; (3) to send letters to non-chamber of commerce member organizations, saying that it is to promote the movement. At this point, the case was resolved.</p>
<p>More Than 400 Yuan Donated on the Spot; After the discussion, an immediate donation was held, resulting in a total of 400 yuan in national currency. Lei Yinshun, Lu Guomian, each donated 50 yuan; Chen Zhongchi 20 yuan; Liu Jingqing 25 yuan; Jian Chinan, Liu Tongyun, Zhou Xingchi, Su Chaolian, Zhang Lanzhou, Cao Fuzhao, Xin Yuming, each donated 20 yuan; Wu Shipu, Li Binglin, Pan Fan'an, Huang Lianfu, and Xian Peikun each donated 10 yuan; Huang Mianying donated 5 yuan, all in national currency. In addition, Wu Hanzhen of the Chinese Amateur School sent a letter to initiate overseas Chinese schools to oppose Wang Jingwei's sensational telegram. After discussion, it was rejected.</p>

<p>The third group of more than a dozen members of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association's return-to-China service corps departed for Xijiang via Macau yesterday. Together with the two batches that had already departed, a total of 65 people have served, of which 40 are serving in the Xijiang area and 25 are serving in the Lianjiang area. In addition, there are 40 more members who are scheduled to depart for a training camp in Xijiang on a given day.</p>

<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, import merchants in Hong Kong were unable to transport goods into the mainland. They requested the Western Chamber of Commerce to postpone delivery, but there was no result. Recently, they appealed to the four Chinese representatives, asking them to request the authorities to come forward and maintain the situation. Yesterday, they received a reply from the Chinese representatives, who were willing to do their best to request the Western Chamber of Commerce to postpone the delivery. All the details have been reported in the newspapers. According to the leader of the textile and foreign goods industries, the matter has now improved because the total amount of goods stored in warehouses is no more than 5 million. Recently, they have been continuously leaving the warehouses and entering the mainland through Guangzhou Bay and other places. It is believed that another 2-3 million yuan can be sold before the end of the lunar year. Seeing this, foreign firms have slightly relented in their handling, and are no longer as insistent as they were a few days ago.</p>

<p>Since the War of Resistance Against Japan in South China and the fall of the war zones, the number of war-stricken compatriots who are displaced and have nowhere to turn has been increasing day by day. It is heartbreaking and pitiful. If we do not find a way to nurture and educate them, these orphaned children will not only fall into depravity, but also have no way to survive. Famous figures in Hong Kong, such as Ye Lanquan, Cai Chaoqun, Li Yunai, Cai Baotian, and Lu Hansheng, have seen this and organized the Orphanage for Handicraft Education. The purpose is to take in orphans and teach them handicrafts, so that they can serve the country and society in the future. The orphanage is currently in active preparation and is expected to be established soon.</p>
<h3 id="e17">The South China Morning Post Publishes an Editorial Denouncing Wang Jingwei, Saying That Wang's Views Have Never Been Firm and Guaranteeing That Wang's Attempts Have Failed <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since Wang Jingwei's sensational telegram advocating peace was published, our government authorities and compatriots at home and abroad have denounced it in unison, and friendly countries that sympathize with our resistance and nation-building have also criticized it. Yesterday, the English-language South China Morning Post published an editorial entitled "The Failure of Wang Jingwei," severely criticizing Wang's absurd move to advocate peace. First, it discussed the firm belief of the Chinese people in resisting Japan and building the nation. Then, it analyzed the peace proposals put forward by Wang and believed that if Wang's proposals were followed, how could China avoid losing its territory and sovereignty? Wang did not explain. He seemed to have a new concept of the value of the promises offered by the Japanese. This may also be a new perception of the mediocrity of the Japanese. Wang's views have never been firm and consistent. This time, his advocacy of peace has been strongly criticized, which is the greatest manifestation of the general loss of faith in him. If Wang's proposals are followed and the desires of the Japanese are satisfied, they will expand their aggression, and China will not only turn against the aid given by its former allies, but also suffer a dishonorable failure. Finally, it said that we dare to guarantee to all friends of China that Wang's attempts have failed.</p>

<p>Mr. Kuang Guangyin, director of the General Company of the Chinese Merchants' Exhibition Hall at the Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco, USA, and general manager of the China Morning Post for Youth, returned to China this time to collect Chinese merchants' goods for exhibition for more than two months. Many goods have been collected and sent to the United States in four batches. The first two batches have already been sent, and the third and fourth batches are scheduled to depart on the 13th of this month. Mr. Kuang held a reception for the local press at the Datong Restaurant at 4 p.m. yesterday, attended by editors and general managers of various newspapers. Mr. Kuang reported on the preparations for his return to China, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>More Than 40 Countries Participate in the Exhibition; The Golden Gate World Exposition is held to commemorate the completion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, to arouse the world's attention to great buildings, and to promote greater prosperity in the future. The scale is grand and the intention is far-reaching. All countries in the world attach great importance to it, and more than 40 countries participate. However, our government is not able to do so during the difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan. For the sake of the country's image and for the sake of developing business, our overseas Chinese do not allow us to neglect this great exposition. Therefore, a company was organized to participate in the capacity of Chinese merchants. A "Chinese Village" was built in the exposition site, and I was sent back to China to be responsible for contacting manufacturers, selecting national goods, and collecting personnel to participate. I arrived in Hong Kong by Pan American flight on November 2 last year after being assigned.</p>
<p>Our National Goods Are Available in All Styles; After returning, due to the fall of Guangzhou and the obstruction of inland transportation, the progress of various matters was not without impact. Fortunately, our press colleagues did their best to promote it, and all sectors of commerce and industry provided enthusiastic assistance. The national goods that have now been purchased include tea, silk, porcelain, lacquer, jade, drawnwork, silverware, ivory, embroidery, calligraphy and painting, gold dragons, yarn dragons, and yarn lanterns, Autumn Scenery, etc. The skill aspects include national skills, martial arts, Cantonese opera, Peking opera, stilt opera, and hand-held opera. All facilities are based on the national standpoint, introducing national goods, and promoting culture is the sole purpose of the company. I sincerely hope that all sectors will cooperate to develop Sino-US trade and enhance China's international position. It is noted that Mr. Kuang was originally scheduled to take a Pan American flight to the United States on the 5th, but has now been rescheduled to take off on the 6th.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Remarks by US Congressman Dawson: England and America Should Actively Assist China; Economic Aid to China Can End the Far East War; × Finances are on the Verge of Collapse and Cannot Be Sustained for Long <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Dawson, a member of the California State Assembly, chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, and expert in finance, recently arrived in Hong Kong. The other day, he attended a meeting of the Hong Kong Rotary Club and gave a speech on Anglo-American relations. He also touched on the Far East issue, advocating that the United Kingdom and the United States should cooperate to deal with it. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to ask for his specific opinions on the Far East issue. After conveying the intention to Mr. Dawson, he smiled and told the reporter that what he had stated yesterday (the day before) was just a general overview of the issue. He then said that as of today,</p>
<p>The situation in the Far East is indeed extremely serious. The United Kingdom and the United States should take joint action swiftly to cope with it. The disputes caused by × people in the Far East, in fact, involve China's internal affairs, such as the establishment of pseudo-organizations. The unilateral actions of × people are difficult for all countries to accept. The aim of such actions is to exclude the interests of all countries in China and implement a monopoly. This is absolutely incompatible with the Open Door Policy. The joint action advocated by him between the United Kingdom and the United States is to maintain this policy and find ways to end the war. However, it should be pointed out here that the vast majority of the American people are deeply sympathetic to China's current</p>
<p>Suffering from aggression. The friendly relations between China and the United States will be maintained without pressure. The various hypocritical propaganda of × people is never believed by Americans. No matter how much they exaggerate their victory, the general American people greatly discount it. Therefore, if the United States participates in any steps to end the war, it will definitely stand on China's side. At this point, the reporter asked whether insisting on the Open Door Policy, which presupposes the integrity of China's sovereignty, urgently requires the active action of the United States, but is this consistent with the "isolationist policy"? Mr. Dawson replied that, indeed, this principle does have its limitations, but due to the lessons of reality, many Americans feel that there is a need for adjustment. In other words, if it is necessary in fact,</p>
<p>The isolationist policy, although not completely abandoned, is also revised to adapt to the reduction in the barriers of time and space due to scientific development. Absolute isolation is practically impossible today. Mr. Dawson continued that, in his personal opinion, a concrete way to end the Far East war would be to actively assist China economically. This alone would be enough to give × people a serious blow, without the need for any military action. Now × people are on the verge of collapse. Their economy is exhausted and they are in a desperate state. Although they are struggling, it is difficult to break through the difficulties. Their access to borrowing in foreign financial markets has been completely cut off, so it is difficult to maintain for long. Regarding the Anglo-American loan, Mr. Dawson said that this is a symbol of joint Anglo-American action. In his personal opinion, this kind of economic assistance can be expected to continue to be provided by the United States.</p>
<p>British people probably feel the same way. Sponsoring China during this difficult stage is indeed the easiest way to end the war and realize the above-mentioned Open Door Policy. Finally, Mr. Dawson asked the reporter if he had read in the newspaper recently that Mr. Wang Jingwei advocated a compromise with × halfway through, but he did not know if it was true. The reporter told him that Wang's move was purely his personal arrogant act, and the highest authorities and all the people of the country expressed their utmost contempt and were determined to resist to the end. At this point, Mr. Dawson said that it would be too ridiculous for China to compromise halfway after fighting hard for more than a year. He knew that Wang's proposal would not have any impact.</p>
<h3 id="e21">School News <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>South China College: South China College, located on Lion Rock Road, Kowloon, was established by a group of celebrities and scholars in conjunction with wealthy Chinese businessmen. It has been half a year since its establishment. The president of the college, Zhong Luzhai, studied education at Mount Holyoke College in the United States and obtained a doctorate in education. After returning to China, he served as the dean of the Faculty of Arts at National Tsinghua University and taught at Shanghai University, Xiamen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Xiangqin College, and other schools for many years, and has rich experience. The professors are also all specialized scholars, including Zeng Youyi, Lei Tongqun, Cheng Jiyuan, and more than ten others. It is reported that since the school was permitted by the Chinese education authorities to operate in accordance with the regulations, it has been working hard to expand its school affairs, in addition to raising funds to add departments, adding affiliated middle schools, and reporting for registration in accordance with the law. Recently, it has also selected a newly built Western-style building at 27-29 Lion Rock Road as the school building. The building has a total of eight floors, and all styles are built according to the needs of the school. Moreover, the location is quiet and the scenery is pleasant, making it a good place to study. A booklet of the 27th year outline has been printed, and will be mailed for a postage of two cents.</p>
<p>Liqun School: Qingzhou Municipal Second Elementary School was well-run and had a good reputation. It was suspended due to the current situation. The principal of the school, Mai Xizhuang, arrived in Hong Kong a month ago and specially opened "Liqun School" at 145-150 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, to recruit new students for all grades of elementary school and kindergarten. The school building is newly built, elegant, spacious, and bright. All the teachers are from the original Second Elementary School of Qingdao. It is now fully prepared and it has been decided that classes will begin next semester. Registration will begin on the 6th of this month. It is also reported that Jiang Guanxun, the principal of the 70th Municipal Elementary School in Guangzhou, will also assist in everything.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Passing off Fish Eyes as Pearls <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Huiren</p>
<p>Starting from × Goods Posing as National Goods</p>
<p>Passing off fish eyes as pearls, using the fake to confuse the real, those who are not knowledgeable are easily fooled and deceived. However, a fish eye is still a fish eye, no matter how cleverly it is made, it will eventually not be able to hide from the eyes of connoisseurs. The same is true for × goods.</p>
<p>, almost every Chinese person has two beliefs: first, to accelerate the economic collapse of the enemy; second, to complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the country. After the war of resistance, × goods in China can be said to be like the sun setting on the river, no longer what they used to be; except for a small part that is smuggled in and is difficult to prevent, openly imported goods are no longer seen in the mainland. Even in Hong Kong, the sales of × goods have also sharply decreased as a result. However, "sharp decrease" is only "sharp decrease," not "disappearance"; even in recent months, it has been seen to "increase." What is the reason for this? The natural reason is that it is also deceived by the "passing off fish eyes as pearls" trick. In the past, the method of passing off × goods as fish eyes and pearls was simply to repackage them and import them. Even if one did not have enough knowledge, one could still question them carefully, and the result would always be easy to determine whether it was a "pearl" or a "fish eye"; but it is pitiful that some of China's factories today have become institutions for manufacturing × goods, and identification is even more of a headache.</p>
<p>Originally, after Shanghai fell into the hands of ×, although most of the Shanghai factories followed the orders of the National Government and moved, no less than twenty moved to the mainland, and seventeen moved to Hong Kong. However, there is still a part that is within the sphere of influence of × people and cannot be evacuated in time. It is inevitable that × will use them. After × people occupied it, they produced goods in a continuous stream, and transported them to Hong Kong under the name of Chinese merchants. In this way, not only do people not know that they are × goods, but they are promoted as national goods. Why has the number of repackaged imported × goods suddenly increased in recent months?</p>
<p>Last year, the incident of ×× Company being plastered with slogans caused a stir in the city. It is worth mentioning again at this time. Those who buy × goods are not because they are, but because they "do not have enough knowledge"; those who know the goods are the sellers, who knowingly pass off fish eyes as pearls, using × goods to deceive customers, and should be punished to the fullest extent! Yesterday's newspaper reported that the central government's regulations on banning × goods stipulated that those who pass off × goods as national goods would be sentenced to death. Strict laws and severe punishments can be said to be appropriate.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Shanghai Vocational Circles Federation made two points that are most noteworthy: one, to actively promote the movement by using the power of society, and to strive for universality, depth, and effectiveness; two, to be absolutely impartial and not to show favoritism. Indeed, as long as the power of society can be used, it will be more effective than any other power. Isn't the incident of ×× Company a manifestation of social power! The compatriots in Shanghai, in such a special environment, did not hesitate to do such sacred work.</p>
<p>In front of a cloth shop, a couplet was erected, with large characters: "How to distinguish between native and foreign goods, carefully evaluate pearls and fish eyes." Although it is not fluent, it is very innocent.</p>

<p>At 7 pm on the 3rd evening, on the sea near Mangjing, which is adjacent to Hong Kong waters, a grain cargo ship registered in Hong Kong was robbed by two bandit boats. The stolen goods amounted to 790 yuan. The registered number of the boat was 679, and the boat owner was Chen Ba, 39 years old. According to his statement to the Au Tau Police Station, at 7 pm that evening, when he was sailing to the sea near Mangjing, which was close to Hong Kong waters, he suddenly saw two bandit boats approaching. The two boats were carrying more than ten bandits, four of whom were masked with black cloth. Among the rest, seven were carrying guns. When the bandit boats approached, they shouted at the grain boat to stop. The people on the grain boat knew that they had no guns to defend themselves, and that the two bandit boats were no match for the crowd. Knowing that they could not resist, they allowed the bandits to board the boat and loot. In total, the bandits looted 115 sacks of grain, worth about 500 Hong Kong dollars. In addition, all the tinware, white rice, cash, and clothing on the boat were also looted. The total loss was about 790 yuan. After the bandits finished looting, they turned around and fled towards Mangjing. Later, Chen Ba continued to sail to Hong Kong, and arrived in Yuen Long, New Territories yesterday morning. He then went to the Au Tau Police Station to report the case. The police are now making every effort to investigate the whereabouts of the bandits. Because four of the bandits were masked, it is clear that the victim had met or knew them, and was afraid of being recognized, so it would be easier to solve the case, so they covered their faces with black cloth.</p>

<p>Among the members of the National Political Consultative Conference currently in Hong Kong are Zhang Yijun, Hu Jingyi, Wang Yunwu, Gan Jieshou, Wu Zhimei, Tao Xingzhi, Chen Shouming, and more than ten others. Since Wang Jingwei issued a telegram betraying the country and the party, all of them have been indignant. Councillor Zhang Yijun told reporters yesterday that there are many councillors staying in Hong Kong, and he intends to convene a meeting of the councillors to exchange views and communicate news from all parties. The third Political Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to be held in Chongqing this month, but the date has not been set. Now that the Speaker has left, the central government must appoint a capable person to succeed him. The candidate has not yet been determined, and the date of the meeting may be postponed to February. Councillor Hu Jingyi, a business magnate from Sichuan, has been in Hong Kong from Ningbo and Chongqing for many days. He plans to take a ship to Singapore on the 6th of this month. If he can make it to the third Political Consultative Conference, he will pack his bags and return to the country. This trip is to investigate the situation in Nanyang in order to develop domestic industries.</p>

<p>— Qizhuo</p>
<p>Naval Review: Rear Admiral Nugent Encourages Troops to Work Hard Due to the Seriousness of the Situation</p>
<p>The citizens of countries with backward navies cannot help but feel infinitely ashamed when they visit the advanced naval reviews of friendly nations.</p>
<p>However, thinking back to our sacred War of Resistance that has already begun, the future of the New China has already revealed a glimmer of dawn in the long night: our "tomorrow" is about to arrive, and the advanced phenomena of friendly countries today may not be a good example for our nation-building tomorrow. The reporter finally replaced his feelings of shame with excitement, and yesterday morning, he hurried to Happy Valley to watch the annual review of the British Royal Navy's squadron stationed in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The review was originally scheduled for 10 am, but the personnel had already gathered several minutes earlier. Sacred time is naturally a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>The vast racecourse was like being covered with a yellow-green carpet. Thousands of sailors, divided into nine squadrons, stood upright, motionless and silent. This silent picture only had the tails of the horses that the reviewers were riding on flicking up and down and left and right very vigorously, attracting the attention of countless spectators around, which was quite interesting.</p>
<p>Those who were invited to watch the exercise this time included: General Jia Naixi, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in China, Deacon, Commander of the Hong Kong Navy, Burke, Commander of the Air Force, Mackland, Army Officer, Ewen, Chief of Staff of the Army, and hundreds of other people, including the captain of the French warship stationed in Hong Kong. Many other heads of various institutions and Chinese and Western merchants were also invited to watch the exercise, numbering about a thousand people.</p>
<p>The large clock on the podium struck exactly 10 o'clock. The commander standing at the highest point of the podium gave a flag signal, and all the sailors on the field stood at attention very quickly and neatly, and hoisted their guns. The collective action was simply the action of one person, and discipline showed its great role in the group.</p>
<p>The melodious and majestic music then played, stirring the silent air, and the review ceremony officially began.</p>
<p>First, the troops saluted Rear Admiral Nugent with the military salute. Commander-in-Chief Buguan immediately rode his horse in front of the podium and asked Rear Admiral Nugent to review the troops. The reviewing officers included Admiral Nuyer, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, Brann, Commander of the British warship Birmingham, Vice Commander Jikitono, Commander of the British warship Birmingham, etc., a total of six officers. They rode slowly in front of the nine squadrons, reviewing.</p>
<p>Then the reviewing officers pulled the reins and stood under the flags in the middle. The nine squadrons turned into a straight line and advanced, passing in front of the reviewing officers one after another.</p>
<p>In addition to the British Royal Marines stationed in Hong Kong, the main body of the review also included two naval teams, who accompanied the performance. Their spirit was particularly heroic.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing was that the leather shoes, black velvet clothing, green leggings and belts, and the white-topped uniform hats and "naval-style" turned-down collars were exactly the same and looked like patterns with very obvious lines.</p>
<p>Every soldier on the field was carrying a long gun, and the bayonet flashed. This is a terrible weapon, but "peace" depends on it to guarantee it. Such guns and knives have become "artistic guards" that constitute the pattern in this great and solemn square.</p>
<p>When the guns were hoisted, lowered, turned left, turned right, advanced, and stood at attention, the uniform steps and the up-and-down wrist movements...were simply the same action, which was also very interesting. The lack of individual freedom in a group is also shown here.</p>
<p>This vast and mighty army advancing made us associate with the heroic soldiers of our motherland, who are just like this galloping on the battlefield. While praising the navy of friendly nations, we also thought of the greatness of the loyal and brave soldiers of our motherland.</p>
<p>Then, Rear Admiral Nugent delivered a personal speech, which was broadcast by a radio, and everyone on the field heard it. The clock pointed at 10:45, and the solemn ceremony was declared closed.</p>
<p>When leaving the field, six senior officers led the way on horseback, the military band was in the middle, and the entire navy formed a neat team and marched back to the barracks or ships from the city. Everywhere they passed, every household came out to watch the fun. Some sighed that "China is not as good as Britain" — others believed that we would also learn from the example of friendly nations tomorrow.</p>
<p>Regarding Rear Admiral Nugent's speech, he encouraged the troops to work hard due to the seriousness of the situation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Dear colleagues, I believe that only today in the year do I have the opportunity to address many colleagues: I believe that today's grand review is the most valuable." The first point is to make you organized, and the second point is to make you cooperative. Many colleagues are exercising together. It is commendable that you can gather all units to form today's grand exercise, which is a manifestation of cooperation. At the same time, it also gives the officers the opportunity to command their subordinates, and the soldiers have the opportunity to raise their guns. I think the most important point is that the soldiers have the opportunity to raise their guns. We naval personnel must know that the preparation and training of the navy is a huge responsibility; especially our navy stationed in China, that is, the ships of our navy today, are always ready to protect the lives and property of our British people. I remember that on July 1 last year, we sent 110 naval personnel to Hankou by land. Although they were in a difficult environment, they were able to do a satisfactory job; in the Mediterranean, our navy cooperated with the army to quell the riots in Palestine; it seems that the training of the marines is very important. I am very impressed by what you have shown today. I also know that you, dear soldiers, should use the spirit of continuous and indomitable spirit to develop good skills. Although we are in a time of world events, I dare to boast of you and have confidence in the British monarch. Even if any event occurs in the future, you will definitely do your best and do not let the fleet of our countries stationed in China feel inadequate."</p>

<h3 id="e27">Book Hermitage <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——National Tunes Talk</p>
<p>Zhang Shengjie of the Qing Dynasty wrote a zaju opera "Painting Hermitage" about the painter Zhao Zigong and his follower Zhao Mengfu. Both of them were members of the Zhao clan, and after the Song Dynasty fell, Zigong remained in seclusion and did not serve, while Mengfu shamelessly served the Yuan Dynasty. Mengfu came to visit Zigong, and Zigong ridiculed him for a while. This is based on the following two anecdotes:</p>
<p>"Zigong bought a boat under the lake, drank heartily, and dried his hat with wine in the evening. At dusk, he entered Xiling, swept across Gushan, moored his oars among the lush trees, pointed to the most secluded place in the forest, stared and shouted: 'This is truly the idle brush of Hong Guizi Dong Beiyuan!' Several neighboring boats were all shocked and sighed that he was a true banished immortal!" (Song Zhou Mi Qi Dong Ye Yu)</p>
<p>"Zigong entered this dynasty and did not like to serve. He lived in seclusion in Guangchen Town in the state. His follower Mengfu came to visit him, but the Duke refused to let him in. His wife persuaded the Duke, and he finally let him in through the back door. After sitting down, he asked: 'Are the Bian Mountains and Lakes still beautiful?' Mengfu said 'What?' The Duke said 'What can my brother do if the mountains and lakes are beautiful?' Mengfu left. He ordered someone to wash the seat." (Yuan Yao Tongshou Lejiao Siyu)</p>
<p>This play writes about Zigong's anger after hearing that his follower had responded to the Yuan Dynasty's call for talented scholars. He angrily sang the "Yellow Orioles Listening in Jixian Pavilion": "Going to court, the jade pendants chime, talking about the Sage Dynasty's favors. They do not think about who broke the rivers and mountains of the old country. They dance and sing in the palace! (I think the country has supported scholars for three hundred years, and only got a few loyal ministers like Wen Tianxiang! Liu Mengyan, as the Number One Scholar and Prime Minister, and Mengfu, as a member of the imperial family, still shamelessly lost their integrity. What else can be asked!) They cannot bear to starve in Shouyang, and cannot learn to lie high in Liaodong. Who would be willing to worry about the royal family early, and the bronze camels weep in the thorns!"</p>
<p>Later, the boatman saw Zigong painting and lying down, and mistakenly thought that Zigong was Mengfu, so he said: "What a pity! He shouldn't be an official. Since ancient times, the enemies of parents cannot live under the same sky. For example, if your ancestors' property is taken away by someone, you should fight to the death with him—why should you become obedient to him!"</p>
<p>The mockery of Mengfu by the servant is also very interesting. The servant heard that Mengfu was only allowed to enter through the back door, and said: "A dignified scholar is not allowed to enter through the front door. He looks like a ghost sneaking in through the back door. If there were no back door, he would have to crawl through the dog hole!" Mengfu was ridiculed by Zigong at the beginning: "After being separated for several years, I didn't expect you to become so successful!" When he left, he was in a bad mood, and the servant said: "Master, don't be angry, don't go back to the sea. I have two sayings, let me tell you: let them laugh and scold, I will still be a good official!"</p>
<p>I don't know whether it was out of cherishing Mengfu's talent or because the author himself was also a minister of a foreign dynasty, Jiang Shiquan's "Winter Green Tree" did not have much derogatory words for Mengfu, but rather seemed to praise him. This point seems to be inferior to Wu Weiyao of the late Qing Dynasty, the author of "Painful History," who gave more sympathy to Zigong. However, the kind of thorough mockery of traitors like Zhang Shengjie's even Wu Weiyao would have to admit that he was inferior.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Literary Criticism in 1938 <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Regarding general discussions of wartime literature, the main focus is on discussing the creator's direction because this is the fundamental issue of wartime literature at this stage.</p>
<p>On the issue of direction, Mr. Mao Dun expressed very correct and valuable opinions in his article "Thoughts of August—A Review of a Year of Wartime Literary Trends" in the first volume, ninth issue of "Literary Front." He also consistently provided us with the most practical and profound instructions in the "Book Review" section of "Literary Front" with a sincere attitude. In the thirteenth issue of "Wartime Literature," he also published "On Strengthening Criticism." Mr. Zhu Xiuxia also published an article "On Realistic Wartime Literature" in the fourth issue of the first volume of "Literary Front," which accurately pointed out the superficial tendencies of conceptualization, abstraction, and monotony in wartime literature. In addition, Mr. Kajii Motojiro, a Japanese revolutionary writer who participated in our country's war of resistance, also successively published "Literary Thoughts" in the fifth and sixth issues of "War Zone Bi-Monthly," published "Miscellaneous Literary Essays" in the fifth issue of the third collection of "July," published "On the Question of 'Art and Propaganda'" in the sixth issue of "Wartime Literature," and held two "Literary Symposiums" with the colleagues of "July," etc.</p>
<p>From the perspective of category production after the War of Resistance, reportage and scripts were produced the most, followed by poetry, and then novels. From the perspective of creation tendencies, as Mr. Mao Dun analyzed in "Thoughts of August":</p>
<p>"In the first half of the past year (of course, this is a very rough division), the main trend in the literary world was to focus on the depiction of individual heroic scenes. Most works took the heroic and tragic stories in the War of Resistance as their subject matter and attempted to explain the greatness of the era from these stories themselves! The determination and courage of the Chinese people, their understanding and hope, their tolerance of current sacrifices, and their certainty of final victory. Such attempts, coupled with insufficient time to conceive and experience, unconsciously led to a phenomenon of focusing on writing about 'events' rather than writing about 'people.' In other words, there was a fixed story framework first, and then characters were filled in, while the concepts of the Chinese people's determination and courage, understanding and hope, their tolerance of current sacrifices, and their certainty of final victory were distributed and filled into the characters.</p>
<p>I believe that very few of the works at that time were satisfactory. The reason lies in the fact that there were still too few writers who delved deeply into life, and there were indeed many who followed the trend of describing heroic events.</p>
<p>'From 'events' to 'people' can be said to be a major trend in the past six months.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that a further step in wartime literature in the past six months is that writers have begun to selectively and plannedly depict the most typical events among the heroic events.'"</p>
<p>This analysis not only points out the creative tendencies of wartime literature in the past year but also indicates the fundamental question of literary creation — writing about people, having characters, and then arranging stories: depicting the character of people in a typical environment.</p>
<p>This is a fact: shortly after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, almost all literary works wrote about heroic events or the invaders' atrocities of rape, plunder, and massacre. This caused the monotony and uniformity of the works. Therefore, Mr. Mao Dun repeatedly called for writing about people; Mr. Zhu Xiuxia also seriously pointed out: we must not only depict heroic events, we must not only express the invaders' atrocities, we must especially express the pro-Japanese factions, Trotskyites, traitors, and all the remnants of the old era. Those negative factors that hinder the War of Resistance and nation-building; we must especially express the invaders' vicious conspiracies of both soft and hard tactics, such as buying off traitors and recruiting ignorant refugees back to the occupied areas to be obedient citizens. These instructions are applicable principles for past, present, and future wartime literature. Our country's War of Resistance is a national revolutionary war. Externally, it is a national war to overthrow Japanese imperialism and strive for national independence and freedom; internally, it is a revolutionary war to build a free and prosperous New China on the ruins of war. Wartime literature must shoulder this sacred task. Wartime literature must observe, experience, and express the typical national heroes and typical national dregs in typical environments from multiple, related, and dynamic perspectives, and must also express the invaders' hard tactics—atrocities, and soft conspiracies—inducements.

<h3 id="e29">"The Art of Changing Colors" <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Luo'er</p>
<p>——Sending to Wang [Jingwei], Part Two</p>
<p>Mud dolls dare not cross the river; this principle is simple, but "fish eyes" can "pass for pearls," which not everyone can see through. The reason is that "fish eyes" still resemble "pearls" to some extent. However, humanity is constantly evolving. Spies who have the "art of passing off" have actually been able to "pass off" for a year and six months, which shows how clever their "art of passing off" is. If we slightly expose its cleverness, then you can discover that the so-called "art" is actually holding on to a "color." Where does this color come from? Answer: It is purchased from Tokyo, especially from Mr. Konoe [Fumimaro], a famous expert in color science.</p>
<p>Let's just give an example to let us understand Konoe's art, and then talk about the abilities of the peddlers. For example, Japanese fascists want to create the great cause of their "continental policy," so they panic and shout as if they were frightened by some ghost: "China has red, it must be communist, and we must prevent communism," and as a result, the "Imperial Army" is dispatched. This is one example. Secondly, following the application of red paint, there comes the green "peace" paint to establish the East Asian "New Order," and of course, there are other yellow "benevolent rule" brand paints, etc.</p>
<p>The traitors mixed in the War of Resistance are also mostly using paint to decorate themselves. However, the use of paint here is very skillful, sometimes showing "sacrifice color," sometimes "scorched earth color," sometimes "escape color," sometimes "azure blue"... It is really too numerous to list all the changes, but in the end, it is still "Jingwei color." And "Jingwei color" is in harmony with "Konoe color," so there appeared the astonishing "important suggestions." The art of changing colors has been exhausted, and Mr. Wang's [Jingwei] original traitorous form is completely exposed. From now on, there is no need to apply colorants anymore.</p>
<p>This is a color-changing drama. In fact, clear-sighted people have long warned the people of the country to be careful. Of course, now that the original form has appeared, everyone can understand, but we cannot assume that we can breathe a sigh of relief. Please raise the necessary vigilance and prepare to deal with possible events!</p>
<h3 id="e30">Memories <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yingchuang</p>
<p>The gray curtain slowly opened, and the stars and moon shone brightly. A burst of rumbling cannon fire shattered the silence of the night. The alert morning rooster also flapped its wings, raised its neck, and crowed loudly. The sharp sound waves pierced my sorrowful dreams. I rubbed my weak, lazy eyes, wiped away the excess tears, and peered through the window at the gauze-covered earth outside.</p>
<p>A crashing roar echoed in the empty valley, stirring my sensitive mind. I glanced at the calendar on the desk, with only two shiny steel posts remaining. A wandering heart suddenly felt a longing for my hometown! The New Year's Day in Xiamen: a great procession to comfort the national army, with tens of thousands of people, starting from that Ding'an Road, winding its way like a gigantic dragon lying on the ground, bursting with heroic salvation songs and intense slogans along the way, heading towards the garrison defense area. On Huyu Road, a tense atmosphere of unity, liveliness, and tension was frozen in the air. Soldiers and civilians mingled together, and the slogan "Defend Dadongmen" shattered the midday sun!</p>
<p>I kicked off the quilt and scrambled up, leaning my back against the low wooden screen. I was excited, and I felt that nothing could compare to the joy of that day. Now, on this year's New Year's Day, I am wandering here, unable to hear this powerful roar, unable to smell the gunpowder, and even if you sing or shout, people will tell you to shut up! However, my relatives and friends in my hometown are struggling under the high pressure of iron hooves. Perhaps this year's New Year's Day is the establishment of the so-called "Municipal Government," and shameless puppets are putting on makeup and celebrating their promotions. What I can hear here is naturally different from what I can hear there. What I can hear is the moans of the sick lying under the arcade, the cries of hunger, the noisy sound of cars, the symphony of "mahjong," and the shouts and guesses of the teahouses and restaurants, the melodious jazz music, and the ruthless scolding of the procuresses, and the obscene solicitations of the "International Market."</p>
<p>Soon, the heart-wrenching moans continuously stimulated my mixed nerves. My premonition came true with a cry! I woke up, I was afraid, my heart felt like it had been hit hard. I hugged my head tightly, closed my eyes, and burrowed into the quilt, but my whole body was shivering, and the god of terror was surrounding me on all sides, and it seemed that the fate of death was about to come! But I gritted my teeth and resisted, struggled, and my whole body was burning with fever.</p>
<p>The faint dawn crossed the window bars and shone on my pale face. I opened my eyes and saw the Qing Tian Bai Ri Man Di Hong (Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth) flag fluttering in the face, still waving, which indicated that I must defend our country, and I should go to the motherland to fight, and no longer linger on this island!</p>

<h3 id="e32">Buying Old Books <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Shalivan</p>
<p>Buying old books is a kind of personal quirk of mine. This is another aspect of the pleasure of exploring bookstores, because bookstores are full of new books, and the prices are certainly more expensive. Book lovers are sometimes a little stingy, the reason being their own lack of affluence. Even though there are "10% to 20% off" books in bookstores that are cheaper, they are not entirely to my taste. Unable to get what I want, I seek the next best thing. So, I have a part in old book stalls and shops everywhere. I want to find my favorite books at a low price. Even though I am squeezed in a dark and small room, or squatting on the roadside sunbathing, and spending a lot of time, I do not cherish it at all. When I go back with the books, I am very happy, like children with a piece of candy in their pockets. Sometimes, the people who sell old books raise the price, or they know it is a good book, but I don't have much money in my pocket, so I can only stare blankly, always flipping through the books and reluctantly leaving, looking back as if it were my own loss.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with buying old books is the transmission of germs, as well as damage and dirt. After buying them back home, I have to spend a lot of effort to wash, slap, blow, dry, paste, and bind them. After so much effort, a deep friendship has already developed between me and an old book, which is not as indifferent as a new book. It adds to the power of enjoyment when reading. I often feel this way, as if it is my old friend.</p>
<p>Old books also have a special charm. It is the previous owner of a book!—Even if it has been transferred two or three times, is it not better for me to be the third owner of the book than to be the owner of a new book! This is a kind of magic. For example, I can buy something from the previous owner, even if it is Shanghai, Nanjing, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Xiamen... They are exchanged with each other from afar. In the hands of others ten years ago, today it falls on my bookshelf. Others bought it at a high price of one or two yuan, but I only bought it for one-tenth or one-twentieth of the price. Many things are a story, a legend. If books are spiritual, they would tell a history of vicissitudes, but unfortunately I can only look for the handwriting of my predecessors to explore its surface.</p>
<p>There are also the curves, symbols, detailed annotations, bold criticisms, absurd opinions, funny insertions, as well as sentence breaks, short couplets, strange words, and crooked poems drawn on old books... On the one hand, they can be a reference for my reading, on the other hand, they are also the best pastime besides serious articles.</p>
<p>Buying old books is a personal quirk of mine. "This quirk is so lovely." If you are my fellow traveler, you will say this.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Organizing a Women's Basketball Charity Tournament - Respectfully Dedicated to the "Shen Bao" Cup Drunken Labor Champion - The Joint Association Met Yesterday and Decided to Hold It Soon <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>×People invaded us, like wild boars and long snakes. Half of our country is in ruins, and wailing fills the fields. Where can they turn for help? The colleagues of this newspaper, sympathizing with the innocent and mourning for the orphaned and widowed, have proposed to Mr. Gao Xiwei, Chairman of the Basketball Federation, to organize a large-scale women's basketball charity tournament during the Lunar New Year. This newspaper will donate a silver cup as a prize for the winning team. Mr. Gao presented this proposal of this newspaper at the meeting of the Joint Association Committee last night. The committee members believed that it was a matter of righteous action and should be accepted and organized. It was unanimously approved to hold it in the near future. In addition, the Joint Association also passed several resolutions, which are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e35">Last Night's Women's Basketball Game: Mei Fang, Southwest, Hong Kong University Win <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Dispatch] With the sound of firecrackers, the difficult year of the Republic of China 27 has already passed with the great wheels of time. In the few days after the arrival of the Republic of China 28, the basketball court was quite deserted. Last night, because there were three games scheduled, the spectators were quite lively.</p>
<p>The first game was Xuehua against Mei Fang. Xuehua's strength was already far behind Mei Fang. Moreover, the Mei Fang team was her older sister. Because of this, the game was not very intense. When the final whistle blew, Xuehua, in order to fulfill her sister's championship dream, lost with a score of 20 to 45.</p>
<p>The second game was Nanhua against Southwest. Judging by the strength of the two teams, Nanhua was not inferior to Southwest. However, because Nanhua's players were not accurate with their shots, they had to admit defeat.</p>
<p>At the start of the first quarter, Nanhua took the lead due to a foul by Southwest's right guard. In the blink of an eye, Southwest also scored a point in the same way. At this time, both sides were in high spirits. They went back and forth, like a tug-of-war. After a long melee, Southwest took advantage of another foul by the opponent and continued to score points, ending the first quarter with a score of 3 to 2.</p>
<p>At the restart of the second quarter, Southwest's players took advantage of their initial victory and made another long shot. However, Nanhua did not show any weakness. Fen also took advantage of a free throw to score two points. Southwest's players tried their best to maintain the lead, and the score was not far behind. After another period of fighting, Nanhua missed many opportunities because their players' shots were not very accurate. They inevitably fell behind a little in this quarter.</p>
<p>After the start of the second half, Southwest's morale declined slightly, which Nanhua took advantage of. Three forwards spread across Southwest's restricted area. In the blink of an eye, Fen scored, and Meiwei Ruomei followed up, surpassing Southwest's score. Southwest's players, realizing this, worked hard to maintain their lead. However, it was already approaching the end of the quarter. After Shizhi returned a shot, the whistle blew immediately. Southwest retreated with a score of 17 to 13.</p>
<p>The final quarter was a matter of life and death. Southwest was certainly not willing to give up, and Nanhua was also unwilling to show weakness. Therefore, the game was very tense and exciting. After ten minutes, Nanhua's misfortune began. Not only did they repeatedly miss shots, but Southwest's forwards, Peizhi and Ruomei, seemed to be divinely aided and scored three more times, leading with a score of 23 to 17. Nanhua, in order to avoid the sharp edge, requested a temporary break. However, Southwest's fighting spirit was high, and there was little impact. Thus, until the end of the game, Nanhua inevitably lost with a score of 17 to 24.</p>
<p>The last game was Hong Kong University against St. Paul's. Before the game, everyone knew that St. Paul's would not be a match for Hong Kong University. However, despite this, the game was the most interesting because St. Paul's players temporarily gathered many cheerleaders to support them. When the game was tense, the girls opened their cherry lips and shouted until they were hoarse. However, Hong Kong University also brought many men in suits to help. They shouted and cheered, which was also interesting. As for the game itself, it goes without saying that it was somewhat like that. Until the final whistle blew, Hong Kong University won with a score of 20 to 12. (Bottom People)</p>
<h3 id="e36">World Professional Tennis Authority to Perform in the East This Year: Women's Star Marble and Others Will Come After <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>According to the Singapore "Hua Nan Chen Bao" news, the world professional tennis giants, Burke, Klein, Barnes, and others, will come to the East for public performances in the first half of this year. According to reports, Burke officially joined the professional tennis world on January 1 this year. After performing in the United States, he will travel to the Far East with Klein, Van, and others, traversing Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, and other places. Also, the world tennis players Marble and Pondai may set off this year to come to the Far East for an amateur performance tour. Barnes once came to Hong Kong with Tilden in the past. Panlai and Burke have not yet come. If it happens, it will definitely be a sensation.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Washington University Basketball Team to Compete in the Philippines in March: Expected to Perform Once When Passing Through Hong Kong, Union <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Dispatch] Basketball is enthusiastically welcomed in the Golden State, just as football is in Great Britain.</p>
<p>In the near future—around March—the basketball team of the University of Washington in the United States, in response to an invitation from Manila, will travel to compete, passing through Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The sports news department of a certain English newspaper in Shanghai has been in contact with the team, inviting them to give a performance when they pass through Shanghai. However, a reply has not yet been received.</p>
<p>The technical level of basketball in Hong Kong is very low, and it is a one-sided activity. In addition to the Chinese who are fond of this sport, there are very few foreigners with team organizations.</p>
<p>If the University of Washington team comes to the East in the future and passes through Hong Kong, it is hoped that the Basketball Association will also find a way to invite them to perform once.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the Hong Kong basketball community tried to form teams to go south (mostly to Manila), but in recent years, they have been content with the status quo. The tune of traveling south to observe technology has not been played for a long time.</p>
<p>If the Federation has the intention to have the basketball community of this Association learn from the University of Washington team, then it may as well accept the reporter's request.</p>
<p>Also, the Hong Kong basketball community must not overestimate itself. In fact, the technology is still in its infancy. I remember two years ago, an American warship arrived in Hong Kong and sent a team to play friendly matches with the so-called strong teams in Hong Kong. As a result, the American sailors swept everything, and at that time, the technology of the Hong Kong basketball world was much better than it is now. (East Lang)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Endurance Training Method <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>First, run about a quarter of a mile at a moderate speed to warm up the body, then slow down slightly and continue running for another quarter of a mile at the same speed as the start, but accelerate to the maximum speed in the last hundred yards. After running, take a short, brisk walk. In short, alternate between walking and running for 45 minutes to an hour. Pay attention to the uniformity of steps.</p>
<p>On the way back, you can incorporate other exercises, such as jumping, climbing trees, and pull-ups (Chin Up), so that you can achieve the greatest effect and develop the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and arms.</p>
<p>With this type of exercise, it is easy to overdo it, so we should stop immediately when we feel tired and avoid overexertion. We can change to a brisk walk to complete the entire course. The distance of the route should also be planned in advance.</p>
<p>After exercising, do not let the body cool down suddenly. Take a bath immediately without hesitation. After the bath, use a rough towel to rub the body, and then rest quietly for about an hour.</p>
<p>Rope skipping and jumping exercises—this type of exercise can be used to replace outdoor running and walking. However, the most effective method is to do it every other day. For example, run and walk on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and skip rope and jump on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This will also make it more interesting. When skipping rope, if it feels too easy, you can change to alternating legs. When doing skipping exercises, it is best to choose those that are also beneficial to the torso.</p>
<p>Breathing exercises—if the breathing method is wrong during exercise, it will cause great damage to health, especially when performing exercises mainly for endurance training. When performing strenuous exercises, the lungs need seven or eight times more air than usual. Therefore, as long as the breathing method is correct, any exercise can also achieve the effect of breathing exercises. (Zhong)</p>

<p>Entertainment……Three Sisters Ssaly·Irene And</p>
<p>Mary</p>
<p>It is a song and dance film that brings together singers, musicians, broadcasters, and screen stars. The story is scattered, but a song and dance film does not necessarily need a perfect story. It only needs gorgeous stage settings and humorous songs and dances to succeed as an entertaining "musical blockbuster."</p>
<p>Alice Faye and Tony Martin have excellent singing and dancing skills. The humor of the big-nosed Jimmy Durante is as constant as ever, and he is also an excellent character in the film.</p>
<p>Empress……The Rat Thief</p>
<p>The Rat</p>
<p>This film has a bold and profound depiction of the life of the lower classes of Paris, interspersed with a distorted love story. A thief nicknamed "The Rat Thief" is naturally suave and unrestrained, and has committed many thefts. The police have no choice but to deal with him. Later, because he loves the girl raised by his friend on the one hand, and is fascinated by a wealthy woman on the other, he mistakenly commits murder and is brought to court. The story is very tortuous, but the handling is slightly vague and lacks possibility. The protagonists, Lu Wukedun and Anton Wumbu, also have mediocre acting skills.</p>
<p>Safety……The Ore Love Seedling</p>
<p>Pa nred Desert</p>
<p>A film describing the American West. The plot lacks development, and the first half is slightly obscure. The second half has some thrilling fight scenes, which feel lively and tense. The story tells the process of tungsten mine exploration, the struggle for land rights, the conspiracy and destruction of villains, and the efforts of the mine owner to finally achieve success.</p>
<p>Wu Sheng George O'Brien has a satisfactory performance in this film.</p>
<p>East……Dual Female Competition</p>
<p>Woman chases Man</p>
<p>Looking at the title, you know that it is an interesting film. The content writes about how a father with no money uses various clever methods to ask a son with money for money, and at the same time uses a woman to do it, making a lot of jokes. As a result, the son actually fell in love with that woman, then needless to say, he is willing to take it out and invest in his father's company.</p>
<p>The protagonists are Joe McClear and Marlene Hawkins, and the performance is just right</p>
<p>Dahua……West Line Spy Network</p>
<p>Lancrr Spy</p>
<p>The story describes a British officer who looks like a German officer, and the German officer is captured by the British army. He disguised himself as a German officer and went back to spy on the enemy's situation, but the German officer had a lover, and this lover did counter-espionage work for Germany. Unexpectedly, they really fell in love with each other and told the truth, and let the fake German officer go back.</p>
<p>Similar spy stories have been told many times in the past, and this film is certainly not new. The whole film is handled very loosely, especially the first half is too dull. The two protagonists, George Sanders and Dorothy de Rio, also have no distinctive performances.</p>
<p>Jingxing……Wells Fnrgo</p>
<p>A film with the theme of developing transportation, depicting the situation at that time with hard work, tireless efforts to break through all kinds of difficulties, and it was written very forcefully, and finally achieved success one day.</p>
<p>Joe McCrae and Francis Dee's performance is very commendable. Although it is a nearly historical film, it does not feel dull due to proper handling.</p>
<p>Central……Four Heroes of the Wang Family</p>
<p>Mandarin film</p>
<p>It is a remake of a silent film story, changed into a sound film and dyed in color, and the scene is much more magnificent than the silent film. Wang Yin replaced Wang Yuanlong, who was popular before, and the heroine is Zhang Hong, who stepped into the film industry from the song stage.</p>
<p>New World……Eighth Heaven</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>Starring Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing</p>

<h3 id="e44">US Congress to Have Heated Debate on National Defense, Unemployment, etc.: This Year's Budget Is Also a Key Case, Haibu Suggests Increasing Bases <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt's budget subcommittee will raise several major financial issues in the country: Can the United States continue to be in a state of financial deficit, allowing the government to waste more gold and silver than its tax revenue by billions? It is speculated that this year's budget will spend 900 million US dollars, while revenue is only about 500 million. Although various sources of income have been developed, since Roosevelt became president, the national debt will total 400 billion US dollars. Not only that, but in the next mid-June, another 170 billion US dollars will be added.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Roosevelt's national defense plan is expected to reach 130 million to 150 million, including the cost of building 12,000 aircraft, two 45,000-ton dreadnoughts in the plan, and enriching the strength of the standing army and developing air force manpower. The House of Representatives now expresses its support for this military build-up plan, but it is expected that any proposal to amend the neutrality law will cause disputes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] This session of the US Congress is meeting in a period of international turmoil, and it will not adjourn until the summer. The current international situation may have an impact on the attitude of the US Congress. During the adjournment of the previous Congress, the United States' attitude towards various dictatorial countries has become tougher. Therefore, the US government will ask Congress to support this attitude and first vote to approve the disbursement of 10 million yuan to meet the needs of the country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The 76th US Congress opened at noon today. The Senate and House of Representatives were full of people. New and old members of Congress introduced each other. Thirty-five new senators took the oath of office to Senate Speaker, Vice President Garner. After House Speaker Bankhead was elected for reelection, all members of the House of Representatives took the oath of office to him. Today was only the opening ceremony, so the Senate and House of Representatives did not discuss any bills other than the customary announcement of the meeting. The atmosphere in the hall was extremely harmonious, but the majority of congressmen also realized that the current Congress will definitely cause heated debates when discussing the neutrality law, national defense issues, and unemployment relief issues. According to the distribution of the number of members of the Seventh and Sixth Congresses, (1) the Senate has 69 Democratic members, 22 Republican members, 1 Progressive member, 1 Ultra-Party member, and 1 Farmer-Labor Party member; (2) the House of Representatives has 261 Democratic members, 169 Republican members, 2 Progressive members, and 1 American Labor Party member.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The US Congress held its 76th meeting today, and the important issues that urgently need to be resolved are the national defense issue and the public relief issue. Some newspapers said that this was a "struggle for leadership" of the Democratic Party between President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner. Check that Garner is a representative of the conservative faction of the Democratic Party. He tried to amend some New Deal laws and wanted to fix the implementation procedures so that they would not go any further. President Roosevelt will try to keep the party free and elect progressives as the party's presidential candidates in 1940. He dealt with the relief issue very skillfully, only informing Congress that if Congress does not pass a new appropriation bill for the use of the Public Works Administration, 3 million people will be unemployed by February 7. Republicans and conservative Democrats are advocating for cuts, the restoration of national control of relief funds to prevent the manipulation of politics by the unemployed. However, government officials believe that opposition politicians, in view of the fact that this matter is related to the continued or interrupted assistance of millions of workers, will follow the customary rules and pass the necessary relief funds. Yesterday, Roosevelt's message to Congress will adopt a strong tone, reiterating his opposition to the expansion of centralized countries, and advocating that the United States should regard itself as the leader of the democratic front in the Americas. Today, Congress elected Pang Dick as the Speaker of the House with a vote of 250 to 160. Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that this meeting will thoroughly review the legislation affecting US international relations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] The US Military Department recently suggested to Congress that the US Navy should build several naval bases in the United States and its vicinity in response to the environment. This matter was recommended by a special naval committee responsible for investigating the location of naval bases. Among the bases it proposes to add, nine are in the Pacific Ocean.

<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 4th] Former US-Philippines Army Chief of Staff and current advisor MacArthur suggested that Guam be built into an armed zone, because the island is located within the Philippine archipelago. If a war breaks out and enemy fleets seal off the Philippines, Guam can help and allow the Philippines to maintain a longer period of neutrality.</p>
<h3 id="e45">British Merchants Urge the Government to Adopt a Tough Attitude Toward Japan: Believing That British Interests Will Be Occupied by Japan, They Should Actively Assist China, Which Was Insufficient in the Past <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Mingdun, 4th] Those who have great financial and economic interests in China deeply hope that the government can adopt a tough attitude. Now the United States' attitude toward Japan is becoming increasingly tough, and at the same time, the United States has agreed to provide export credit guarantees to China. Therefore, those who enjoy financial and economic interests in China are very happy. The US credit guarantee to China is after the British should provide export credit guarantees to China. Although the US credit is not much, this move is extremely important to the morale of the Chinese people. As far as the US attitude is concerned, it will not change during the Sino-Japanese war. Therefore, the aid of the British and American governments is still a decisive factor in rebuilding the Chinese government's open door policy. Anyone who enjoys interests in China should pay close attention to this matter and understand the importance of this matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Protests Only Get Ridicule</p>
<p>[Lu) Tou Dun, 4th] Today, "The Times" and "Daily News" both published the British merchants' anxiety over the occupation of British interests in China by Japan. Lee, chairman of the Clerical Printing Union, wrote to The Times, strongly supporting Nicolson's letter of December 21, and condemning the British government's "long-term policy of enduring pain" in China, saying, "It is surprising that Britain has allowed its largest market to be occupied by Japan. British and other foreign interests in China have been deprived by Japan, and diplomatic protests can only get Japan's contempt and ridicule. If the British government does not change its 'long-term policy of enduring pain' and take active and tough actions, then British trade will only decline, and our dignity will also be reduced. Wuguo has invested 300 million pounds in China. British and American exports to China in 1938 were greatly reduced, while Japanese exports to China increased sharply. Since Japan seized Korea and 'Manchukuo,' British trade in these places is only 1%. If Japan's power is not stopped, then this situation will also occur in China. If we can promote export trade, we can cope with huge military expenditures and social undertakings."</p>
<p>Past Aid to China Was Really Insufficient</p>
<p>China has great potential for developing trade. The Chinese people love peace, and they should get our help. Our previous assistance was really insufficient.</p>
<p>In addition, Keeling wrote an article in the "Daily Telegraph" detailing the economic resources of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" and issued a warning against the speculation that Japan's financial and economic situation is about to collapse. He pointed out that Britain's foreign investment, except for Argentina, is the largest in China, saying, "If Japan can overcome its current financial difficulties and establish a Far East group, then Britain will be the first to suffer."</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Vienna, January 4th] It has been officially confirmed by Polish authorities that Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Mr. Litvinov is scheduled to visit Warsaw, the capital of Poland, at the end of this month. Mr. Litvinov will meet with Polish Foreign Minister Beck, and a new Soviet-Polish trade agreement may also be signed. The details of the agreement were finalized in Moscow before Christmas last year. The Polish side believes that the main topic of discussion between Litvinov and Beck will be the Ukrainian issue, as neither the Soviet Union nor Poland wants the issue of self-determination for the 40 million Ukrainians within the Soviet Union to become internationalized.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tunis, January 4th] On the first day of French Premier Daladier's arrival in Tunis, no demonstrations occurred. Observers believe this is due to tight police security and the Italian community's adherence to discipline. Italian newspapers in North Africa are not criticizing the event, publishing the official announcements from both the French and Italian governments. Currently, much attention is focused on the official banquet to be held at the Grand Hotel on Tuesday evening, where Daladier will deliver an important speech. After this banquet, Daladier will travel to Gabès and inspect the border defenses there on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, January 4th] Italian newspapers are publishing articles commenting on Daladier's visit to Corsica, pointing out that Corsica contains Italian characteristics. The "Florentine Daily" stated in an article, "From the Prime Minister's perspective, Corsica is an integral part of Italy, and the local language, literature, culture, and customs are actually related to Tuscany and Sardinia." "La Folla" reported that Corsican architecture is clearly Italian style.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tunis, January 4th] Last night, local and French demonstrators here broke the windows of an Italian clothing store and tore down the Italian flag. French Premier Daladier broadcast here, "I, as the leader of the government, tell you, 'The motherland protects its colonies as the colonies protect the motherland.'" He stated that the time has come for France and its colonies to be firmly united. He then proclaimed with passion, "France gives you order, laws, and freedom from oppression by violence and tyrannical governments. France has ample strength to guarantee your security. France is a peaceful and unified nation, unbreakable, with unlimited glory, possessing solid strength, ready to face external attacks and all dangers. We will not allow any pretext to divert the people of Tunis and France from their common great cause. In this land, we must establish a human society based on lofty ideals; only these lofty ideals can save the world and prevent it from falling into slavery." His speech was punctuated with constant applause.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tunis, January 4th] French Premier Daladier arrived in Tunis city today, where he was warmly welcomed by the French and Muslim communities. The crowds were so dense as he proceeded to the residence of the Governor-General of Tunis that the police had difficulty maintaining order. The roads were so chaotic and congested that the Prime Minister's car had trouble passing. A demonstration against Daladier occurred outside the Palace of Tunis, but the demonstrators were dispersed by the Governor-General's guards and their banners were torn down. In his welcome to Daladier, the Governor-General stated, "Your Excellency can be certain that the people of Tunis will aid France when necessary. I can guarantee this here."</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e51">An Ambassador's Blunder <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>A country's diplomatic envoys are representatives of its nation and government; the position of ambassador is the highest among these representatives. According to diplomatic custom, an ambassador is not only sufficient to represent the government of a country, but also its head of state. Therefore, an ambassador's statements are often the basis for international negotiations, not to mention their importance to world opinion. In the past, China was closed and isolated, and strictly speaking, had no diplomacy to speak of. In recent decades, under the aggression of imperialism, most diplomatic envoys only had the name of conducting diplomacy, but were unable to truly seek benefits for the nation. However, after the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, the situation changed drastically. For example, Dr. Wellington Koo, our ambassador to France, was indeed able to give full play to his talents and bring honor to the country. However, according to recent foreign news reports, our ambassador to a certain major power carelessly made public remarks, based on his own speculations, claiming that our country had expressed peace intentions to Japan. He also gave a lengthy speech at a banquet, lacking thorough observations about the situation, and drawing a pessimistic conclusion about the future of the war of resistance. Now that facts speak louder than words, our country is becoming more courageous as we fight, while the enemy has become "an arrow at the end of its flight." Presumably, the ambassador who has always "valued reality" must now deeply regret his past blunders. However, at the time, this kind of defeatist pessimism not only disheartened our compatriots overseas, but also made people in the ambassador's host country question the reliability of our country's long-term resistance and the reliability of our government's national policy. Therefore, we deeply regret the ambassador's blunder. According to the integrity of a diplomat, if careless statements harm the interests of the country, he should resign to apologize to the people, because as a national envoy, he should not have the freedom to criticize basic national policies. We hope that the ambassador will know how to conduct himself, and we further hope that the government will in the future pay more strict attention to whether the candidates for diplomatic envoys are suitable, and whether their words and deeds are correct!</p>
<p>Beware of New Conspiracies by Capitulationists</p>
<p>Since the Central Government resolved to punish Wang Jingwei, the activities of the capitulationists have suffered a major blow, and the temporary failure of the capitulationists has further contributed to the accelerated collapse of the Konoe Cabinet. However, we must not mistakenly believe that the activities of the traitors have ceased. We must be even more wary of their new conspiracies. There are two pieces of news worth noting: First, the traitors are spreading rumors about the "reddening" of our government, claiming that the "Wang faction" and the "right wing" are being purged, and that "Sun Ke and Chen Cheng are leading the organization of a left-leaning government." In particular, the capitulationists are using their privately-run newspapers to fabricate rumors and incite the people. The second piece of news is that the capitulationists are always using a ruse, deciding to sacrifice a few individuals to issue statements denying their previous absurd telegrams. The main intention of the first piece of news is to confuse international perceptions, sow discord in our internal unity, and hinder our international aid. However, the rumors are too bizarre, and sensible people at home and abroad will not believe them. In fact, not only has the Communist Party repeatedly declared its support for Chairman Chiang and the National Government, but this time the Central Government's punishment of Wang was also the result of a unanimous resolution by all the Central Committee members in Chongqing, including many former confidants of Wang. The intention of the second piece of news is to confuse all parties and divert attention. Of course, the country still hopes that Wang will not make mistake after mistake and repent. However, the so-called method of self-renewal is definitely not something that can be achieved with a single piece of paper, but must be expressed with concrete facts. In short, the traitors are in dire straits, and their conspiracy activities have by no means ceased. We must be even more vigilant in the future. The unanimous condemnation of Wang by various circles is indeed a very good phenomenon, but it is hoped that all sectors of society will make even stronger expressions of support for the Central Government, deal heavy blows to the activities of pro-Japanese elements, traitors, and capitulationists, and effectively restrain all rumors that incite the people!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, January 3rd] Seven warships from the Brooklyn Navy Yard sailed south yesterday, marking the first act of the large-scale U.S. naval maneuvers. 140 warships and 100 aircraft will participate in these maneuvers, the purpose of which is to make European and South American countries aware of the strength of the U.S. Navy. The authorities have designated these maneuvers as "Naval Problem No. 2," and they are officially scheduled to take place on February 13th. At that time, the fleet participating in the exercises will be divided into attacking and defending forces, the purpose of which is to test the defenses of the Panama Canal. Brazil, Colombia, and other extreme southern nations are also planning to send troops to observe the maneuvers. According to the New York Times' naval correspondent, when the maneuvers begin, the authorities will take over all radio equipment along the U.S. East Coast and apply it uniformly. Commercial shipping in the maneuver zone will also be required to assist.</p>

<p>— Author San Bo</p>
<p>Translated by Bao Ren from World News And Views, November Edition</p>
<p>Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, the economic situation within Japan has deteriorated, becoming an arrow at the end of its flight. Due to China's arduous and determined long-term resistance, Japan's gold reserves have been depleted. When the war began, its gold reserves were 1,700,000,000 yen, but as of August 1st of this year, its gold reserves were only 596,000,000 yen.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, Japan's import volume increased by 34% compared to the same period last year, because of the lack of domestic raw materials. 60% of its export goods rely on foreign raw materials for manufacturing, especially cotton and wool, accounting for 99%. Due to Japan's trade deficit, its economy is declining. In the first half of 1938, it spent a total of 195 million yen in reserves. After that, it will be unable to purchase raw materials from abroad to manufacture munitions.</p>
<p>According to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of International Trade, U.S. imports of military raw materials to Japan, including copper, iron, motorcycles, aircraft, iron, and gasoline, have gradually decreased. This year's import volume is 25% to 85% lower than last year. Since the beginning of the war, its war expenses have reached 7 billion yen, accounting for 50% of the annual national income. The total amount of its issued government bonds has reached 18 billion yen.</p>
<p>Domestic prices are also rising rapidly. Rice prices are 30% higher than before the war, barley is 57% higher, meat is 41% higher, and other daily necessities, especially imported goods, are twice as expensive as before the war.</p>
<p>The actual wages of domestic workers are also declining drastically. The working hours of military factories have been extended to 16 hours per day. Most factories have been forced to close due to the impact of the war, and the number of unemployed workers has increased to 1.8 million this year.</p>
<p>Japan's rural economy has been on the verge of collapse. Generally, farmers suffer from reduced labor due to the conscription of young men and horses. At the same time, there is a shortage of agricultural tools and fertilizers, so production is insufficient to meet their own needs. Coupled with various harsh taxes and levies, farmers are frowning and complaining endlessly.</p>
<p>Due to the high cost of living, the livelihoods of poor peasants, small business workers, and craftsmen are facing difficulties. The number of people committing suicide due to lack of food and clothing is becoming increasingly common. The people are resentful of the government's oppression and acts of aggression.</p>
<p>Rising prices and wage cuts have caused constant strikes in Japan. In April this year, 2,500 workers at the Tokyo Electric Factory went on strike, demanding that the factory increase wages, and achieved partial victory. On May 4, 2,960 male and female workers at the Fuji Textile Factory went on strike, demanding improved treatment. In mid-June, workers at 25 military factories in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, jointly went on strike, demanding increased wages, and won complete victory.</p>
<p>Rural farmers also occasionally have riots, demanding that the government reduce or exempt land taxes during the period when the head of the household is on active duty. The struggle between landlords and farmers is growing, and the people's anti-war sentiment is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>The so-called general mobilization law implemented by Japan has caused the domestic small and medium-sized enterprises to decline sharply. Generally, small and medium-sized business owners are very resentful because they are deeply affected. The number of people arrested for opposition is countless. In the first two weeks of August this year, 10,800 merchants and shopkeepers were arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p>According to various statistics, the losses suffered by the Japanese side in this Sino-Japanese War (from the beginning of the war to August of this year) are far greater than those in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905."</p>
<p>Current Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p>Mobilized Personnel……2,000,000+ 1,100,000</p>
<p>Casualties……700,000+ 200,000</p>
<p>War Expenses…7,000,000,000 Yen 2,300,000,000 Yen</p>
<p>Average Daily Expenses……20,000,000 Yen 3,600,000 Yen</p>
<p>More than 700 Japanese aircraft have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese military repeatedly trumpets the war at home and uses sweet words to deceive their people, the Japanese people have never been interested in this war. In August this year, Japanese Major General Takata once spoke on a fascist newspaper, one of which said: "It is regrettable that the Japanese people are indifferent to this war." Now the Japanese people's hatred of the military's war of aggression has turned into a strong anti-war sentiment. At first, the Japanese military's slogan for invading China was to fight a quick battle and make a quick decision, but now it has been changed to a long-term war. Recently, Koiso Kuniaki said: "Japan is forced to prepare for a war that will last for ten years." Later, Araki Sadao added: "We will not hesitate to prolong the war to twenty or thirty years."</p>
<p>At present, the anti-war upsurge in Japan has reached its peak. At the same time, in the Japanese army fighting in China, acts of disobedience and anti-war often occur. Incidents of suicide and mutiny are also gradually increasing. The reason why Matsui Iwane, the former commander of the Japanese army in Central China, was summoned back to the country was that he failed to maintain the discipline of the "Imperial Army". There are countless young people who evade military service and go missing, and deserters who are arrested and killed. Now the Japanese military has reorganized and re-assigned this group of anti-war deserters to guard the POW camps in North China.</p>
<p>The suffering and resentment of the families of soldiers towards the war have made the Japanese military feel uneasy. Its conscription system has plunged the government's internal affairs into a quagmire, which has greatly affected the morale of the frontline troops.</p>
<p>At present, the Communist Party of Japan is conducting secret activities. The atmosphere is boiling, and the Japanese military is extremely anxious about this. Although it has repeatedly suppressed it, it is still ineffective. The Communist Party's anti-war propaganda work is active everywhere, whether in factories, rural areas, or in the army, there are their traces. Generally, the peasant and worker classes, and even the small and medium bourgeoisie, are also actively promoting peace and resisting the military.</p>
<h3 id="e55">British Unemployed Workers Carry a Coffin to Protest for Relief; Clash with Police When Delivered to the Prime Minister's Residence <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, January 2nd] Members of the British National Unemployed Workers' Movement planned to send a coffin to 10 Downing Street, but were stopped by the police. A large truck arrived on Downing Street and stopped outside the Prime Minister's residence. Several people jumped out of the truck, and people inside the truck began to push out a black coffin, painted with the words "The unemployed, their request for relief has been denied." One person went to the number 10 door and spoke to the attendant inside the door, while his companions pushed the coffin off the truck, intending to take it to the front of the number 10 door. Six police officers discovered this and rushed to the scene to intervene, and a dispute over the coffin broke out between the two sides. The police kept the coffin in the truck and ordered the truck to drive away immediately. At the same time, 100 unemployed workers gathered on Downing Street to demand winter relief. Prime Minister Chamberlain was spending his holiday in the countryside, so he did not witness the incident.</p>
<h3 id="e56">New Situation in the Pacific After a Year and a Half of War <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yuan</p>
<p>However, the pleasant dream of the British gentlemen in the Far East was finally shattered by the artillery fire of the Japanese military, not long after the Munich Conference was established. The Japanese military blatantly ignored everything, and without prior notice to the British, directly landed in South China and attacked Guangzhou. The sound of compromise between Britain and Japan suddenly sank to the bottom of the sea, and what arose instead was the joint front of Britain and France in the Far East. At the same time, the British Cabinet passed a resolution at the end of October to strengthen the Far East Fleet. In view of the seriousness of the current international situation, Chamberlain decided to expand the air force and navy on a large scale. For the navy, 45 ships totaling 355,705 tons will be launched in 1939. After these 45 ships are launched, there are still many other ships that can continue to be launched, including two 40,000-ton battleships, four heavy cruisers, three cruisers, and other smaller ships are not counted. This large-scale shipbuilding phenomenon is also unprecedented since the European War.</p>
<p>Regarding the naval and air force bases in the Pacific, since the completion of the Singapore naval port this autumn, further efforts have been made to strengthen it. For example, the strengthening of Hong Kong's air defense and the increase in the number of mechanized army infantry and artillery units is an example. And the naval and air force bases in Australia are also being greatly strengthened because of their connection with Singapore and Hong Kong. Chamberlain also personally visited the French authorities in Paris in November this year. In addition to European issues, the critical situation in the Far East was also the focus of discussion. Under the goal of common defense, Britain and France adopted close ties for their Far East policies, and France's policy towards the Far East turned to be more active due to British support. The recent freedom of anti-Japanese movements in the French territories in the Far East is the best evidence of this. The French authorities have also decided to strengthen the naval and air defenses of Annam, preparing to take joint intervention actions with Britain when necessary. In the past few months, Japanese diplomacy has made several attempts to intimidate France, but until recently, they lost face and disappeared.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>The third sign is the shift of the Soviet Union's military and diplomatic center of gravity to the Far East, and the increasing closeness of Sino-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's military budget for this year has increased to 27 billion rubles. Because of the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, the Soviet Union has adopted a policy of concession towards Germany, and hopes to have further cooperation and friendship with the United States. As for Sino-Soviet relations, judging from the recent development of events, it can be asserted that in the later stages of the war of resistance, it will become the main force to support us.</p>
<p>Although Soviet Russia has no military action against Japan in the Far East at present, we should understand that under the current situation, rather than hoping that Soviet Russia will fight against Japan, it is better to hope that Soviet Russia will help us more, because in this way, it can dismantle the fascist cohesiveness and strengthen it.</p>
<p>In short, today, a year and a half after the start of the war of resistance, the relations between the great powers in the Pacific have undergone significant changes, and Japan has fallen into a dilemma of being surrounded on all sides. In 1939, it is very likely that the great powers will intervene in the actions of Japanese imperialism in the Far East.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Hope for the American Congress <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Song Feiru</p>
<p>The diplomatic conflict between the United States and Japan has recently reached a point of intense confrontation, even if it does not immediately escalate into war between the United States and Japan, "the economic war in the Pacific will reach unprecedented heights." After the war in Guangdong and Hubei, Japan on the one hand declared that the "Nine-Power Treaty" was not applicable to "the new situation in East Asia," and on the other hand, it actually blocked China's economic interests for its own exclusive occupation. The United States subsequently submitted a serious note to Japan on October 6 of last year. Although it received a reply from Japan on November 18, it was still full of sophistry, and the United States was greatly dissatisfied. Therefore, it submitted a second note to Japan the day before yesterday, the content of which is more specific and can be summarized into three points: (1) Pointing out that the Japanese side's restrictions on the behavior and activities of overseas Chinese American people have placed Japan's interests in a superior position, and its impact has undoubtedly given discriminatory treatment to the legitimate interests of American expatriates; (2) Pointing out that this restriction method is unfair and unfounded, and is far from violating the current provisions of international treaties; (3) Declaring that the American people and government cannot agree to the establishment of a rule by a third country in China, acting arbitrarily, and seizing the rights of equal opportunity and fair treatment that the United States has long enjoyed; (4) Declaring that the basic principle of equal opportunity cannot be canceled by a unilateral statement, and denying Japan's right to establish a "new order" in the Far East.</p>
<p>The 76th Congress of the United States convened on the 3rd of this month. The United States government has planned to submit to Congress the data on Japan's discrimination against American commerce in the occupied areas of China, preparing to adopt a positive bill to impose economic sanctions on Japan. At a time when the Japanese aggressors' conspiracy to monopolize China is gradually becoming panicked, and the momentum of sanctions against Japan by Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union is gradually taking effect, the attitude of the United States towards Japan and the resolution of the United States Congress are very important. We would like to offer a few opinions here for the reference of the world, especially the American people.</p>
<p>(1) Economic sanctions against Japan by all countries in the world have reached the point where they need to be effectively implemented. Mere diplomatic notes or verbal resistance cannot awaken the obsessed Japanese aggressors. The current economic discrimination against Britain, the United States, and other countries implemented by Japan is just as listed in the second American note: controlling foreign exchange, forcing the circulation of counterfeit currency, arbitrarily modifying tariffs, and promoting Japan's economic monopoly in China; the United States government should also retaliate against Japan in the same way. We believe that the United States government intends to implement active measures. Newspaper propaganda states that whether President Roosevelt will invoke the provisions of Article 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act depends on whether the American public empowers him. This means that if Congress resolves that the United States can implement this clause against Japan, the United States government will implement it immediately. The American people have always been most enthusiastic in sympathizing with China's resistance against Japan, and since the loss of Guangzhou, the stronghold in southern China, American trade has also been lost due to the establishment of Hong Kong (from January to August last year, American exports to China via Hong Kong accounted for 30% of the total amount. The "Kokumin Shimbun," the organ of the Japanese military headquarters, recently advocated occupying Hong Kong). Whether or not it can preserve its rights and interests in China thereafter depends entirely on whether the American people can grant the United States government the power to implement retaliatory measures.</p>
<p>(2) Japan not only wants to monopolize China's economic rights and interests, but also attempts to actively enter Latin America. In recent years, Japan's entry into various small countries in Central and South America has been very significant. Recently, as President Luo said in his opening speech prepared to be read in Congress, "the three countries (referring to Japan, Germany, and Italy) are also united in their desire to search for markets and political interests in Latin America." At a time when the United States is currently striving for a close combination of "Pan-America" and the American countries all rely on the United States for effective leadership, whether the United States can actively prevent the aggressors of Germany and Japan from infringing on the Americas will determine whether the entire unity of the Americas can be successful and whether it can be consolidated thereafter.</p>
<p>(3) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are already prepared to cooperate effectively with the United States to stop the madness of international adventurers in the Far East. The recent consultations between Britain and France have not been limited to European issues or dealing with Italy, but have also given deep consideration to the Far East issue. Thereafter, Japan's further military actions in southern China will objectively promote cooperation between Britain and France. Britain has signed a trade treaty with the United States that has military and political significance, and its sincerity in cooperation is evident. In addition, as the Soviet Union and the United States have fewer points of conflict due to increasingly close trade relations, objective cooperation is very possible. Subjectively, the Soviet Union also hopes that Soviet-American cooperation will be realized. A few days ago, a certain parliamentary session on the Soviet government side discussed future diplomatic policies, and at that time, effective cooperation with the United States was listed as the most important item. Furthermore, based on the common nature of the Soviet Union and the United States in suppressing the aggressors of Germany and Japan, the eagerness of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States is 100% reliable. What the Soviet Union is concerned about is the United States' adherence to the "isolationist policy," but the American public opinion has inferred when lending money to China that amending the isolation law this year is an important reason, then the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States completely depends on the attitude of this Congress.</p>
<p>The American people's enthusiasm for demanding that the government impose economic sanctions on Japan has been seen in their speeches (some even say that the United States has invisibly participated in Japan's war against China because it supplies Japan with various munitions and military raw materials) and actions (many workers refuse to load Japanese goods ashore and American goods on ships, and the general public also refuses to buy Japanese goods). The Congress, which represents the will of the people, can frankly grant the President the power to implement regulations to sanction Japan: "For any country that discriminates against American merchants, heavy tariffs may be levied on imported goods, and the goods of any other country may be prohibited from being loaded and imported by ships of that country that excludes the United States"; or even "all trade with that country that excludes the United States may be prohibited."</p>
<p>This is what we hope from the American Congress. At the same time, we also hope that the public opinion of the United States and other countries will jointly promote it!</p>

<h3 id="e58">Recent Developments in Guerrilla County Administration in Shanxi <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's communication from Jixian] The changes and reforms of the political institutions in Shanxi began at the beginning of the Lugouqiao Incident. At that time, the Pacification Office and the Provincial Government, in order to make the political institutions of Shanxi suitable for wartime needs, issued a general order to the county authorities that in the event of a fierce attack by the enemy or the fall of the county seat, the county magistrate must lead the people's self-defense forces and guerrillas to move the county administration to the countryside and continue to perform the duties of the county magistrate. Later, Yanbei, Taiyuan, and Linfen fell one after another. Subsequently, the enemy launched a large-scale military offensive in southern and western Shanxi. At this time, the entire county administration of Shanxi was established in the countryside, implementing its guerrilla life.</p>
<p>What exactly is the county administration mechanism in Shanxi like now? Its new political mechanism can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) In the guerrilla areas of northern Shanxi, the county government has changed the four sections of General Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education to four sections of District Administration (First Section), Economy (Second Section), Military Affairs (Third Section), and Civil Training (Fourth Section). General Affairs has been changed to a subsection under the Administrative Section, construction matters are included in the Military Affairs Section, and education matters are merged into the Civil Training Section. This reform has actually expanded the scope of work of each section.</p>
<p>(2) In the First Administrative District (Wutai District), there have been some changes in the mobilization committees of each county. Originally, in counties where the administrative institutions were not sound and civil movements were relatively backward, the mobilization committee was a semi-political organization that mobilized manpower, materials, and financial resources. However, in counties where the political power was well-established, it was an organization that obstructed the consolidation of political power. Therefore, at present, in the First Administrative District of Shanxi, the joint meeting of county magistrates has decided to return the tasks of the mobilization committee that belong to the county administration to the county government.</p>
<p>(3) There have also been some new changes in the mobilization committees in other districts. The Political Department of the Second War Zone once stipulated that the county political institutions should be based on the principle of collective leadership formed by the mobilization committee. Five sections, such as political affairs, economy, civil movement, armed forces, and education and construction, should be established under the county mobilization committee. In this way, it is felt to be simpler and more flexible to use.</p>
<p>(4) In order to quickly correct errors and effectively implement laws and regulations, the county governments regularly convene representatives of various mass organizations to hold administrative inspection meetings. Sometimes, the county magistrates of several counties also convene in one place. However, the powers are still strictly divided. Administration cannot replace the work of civil movement personnel, and civil movement cannot infringe on the powers of administration.</p>
<p>(5) The third and sixth administrative districts of Shanxi have implemented the popular election of district and village chiefs and the participation of mass representatives in the district and village mobilization committees, etc. These are the characteristics of today's county administration in Shanxi.</p>
<p>The second is the work done by the guerrilla county government:</p>
<p>(1) The primary task of the guerrilla county government is to thoroughly destroy the puppet regime of the traitors. It not only thoroughly attacks the puppet maintenance associations, but also strives to have those who have been forced by the enemy to act as traitors serve us. For example, in the eighth administrative district, the maintenance association of a certain county regularly supplied our side with food and important news from the mountains. Therefore, the enemy's puppet regime either could not be established at all, or it was established but was of no use to it.</p>
<p>(2) It is to mobilize a wide range of mass organizations to gather around the government, such as the Sacrifice League, the Peasants' Salvation Association, the Workers' Salvation Association, the Children's Salvation Association, and the Women's Salvation Association. Today, these mass organizations are not only loyal supporters and executors of government laws and regulations, but can also, under the leadership of the government, do sentry duty, investigate the enemy's situation, inspect pedestrians, carry out anti-traitor movements, punish bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people, and launch guerrilla warfare to assist the army in attacking the enemy.</p>
<p>(3) It is to organize powerful self-defense forces and guerrillas who have left production. Due to the enemy's atrocities such as burning, looting, slaughter, and rape, every member of the public deeply hates them. With the government to lead them, the public is automatically organized like a rising storm. Therefore, the number of self-defense forces and guerrillas in Shanxi is countless.</p>
<p>(4) Due to the call of the guerrilla county government, the military and civilians have begun close cooperation. The government not only mobilizes the public to help the army fight, but also calls on the public to help local friendly troops solve their difficulties and try to supply food and other military supplies. The people everywhere destroy the enemy's transportation, demolish city walls and forts, and implement rapid emptying of the fields, making it extremely difficult and obstructed for the enemy to attack a certain area or occupy a city or town.</p>
<p>(5) It is the reasonable burden and the concrete implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction.</p>
<p>In addition, the new county administration in Shanxi today, in addition to the above points, at the same time, the guerrilla county magistrates are not only able to fight bravely, but also able to endure hardship. They automatically reduce their living expenses to below five yuan. When the county seat falls, they perform the duties of the county magistrate in the countryside. Sometimes, they even move from one village to another due to the pursuit of the enemy, but they do not leave the county boundary even one step. They are even less willing to let go of every favorable opportunity to disturb the enemy and assist the regular army in fighting. Therefore, among the 105 counties in Shanxi today, except for the two counties in northern Shanxi (the current provincial government has issued an order to the Wutai District Committee to appoint county magistrates), the remaining 102 counties have established our complete county administration power, and there are more than 7,000 such new county magistrates.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Enhancing National Dynamism <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Lifu</p>
<p>The function of education lies in cultivating virtue and achieving talent. Cultivating virtue begins with self-cultivation, and achieving talent is for the benefit of the group. In other words, cultivating young people through moral, intellectual, and physical education to make them suitable for group life is the main goal of education. The discussion of new education in China has been going on for decades, but the number of scholars who have achieved success is still small, and there are few talents who can be put to use. The study of books is mostly useless learning, and the effect on the way of rectifying virtue, benefiting the people, and enriching life is minimal, which does not require detailed explanation. I have always believed that the education of the revival of the Six Arts is the priority of today's regular tasks. The loss of music in education is the key to the failure of past education. Remedying shortcomings and correcting biases cannot be delayed, and there is no other way to change course.</p>
<p>Confucius' education started with the Six Arts, and among the Six Arts, rites and music were the most important. There are two explanations for the Six Arts. One is: rites, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic. As Yan Xizhai said, rites are to regulate the five relationships, music is to harmonize the five relationships, and archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic are to assist these five relationships. The order in which they are placed can be explained by Mr. Cheng's theory. The other is: poetry, books, rites, music, Yi, and Spring and Autumn Annals. Poetry and books are for self-cultivation, rites and music are for benefiting the group. The Yi and Spring and Autumn Annals use the laws of heaven to clarify the good and bad fortune of human affairs, and explain the changes in the world to distinguish the gains and losses of responding to them, which is for the use of the world. In both theories, rites and music are mentioned, and there is no doubt that they are studies that combine theory and practice.</p>
<p>During the prosperity of the Zhou Dynasty, culture and education flourished, and education was integrated into art. That is why Confucius sighed, "How flourishing is its culture!" The Taibo chapter says, "Be inspired by poetry, establish yourself with rites, and complete yourself with music." Learning poetry and rites must be completed with music, so the importance of music education can be further seen. Therefore, in the education of Chengjun, Dasi Cheng, Xiaosi Cheng, and Lexu all presided over music. In the Zhou official system, Dasi Yue, Yue Shi, Da Xu, and Xiao Xu all presided over learning (the so-called "governing the learning and politics of building the country"). It is also like in the Book of Documents ordering the princes to belong to the Dianyue and the music officials, who actually presided over education. So the position of music in education at that time can be imagined to be important. The Inner Canon says, "At thirteen, learn music, recite poetry, dance with spoons, complete chapters, learn archery and charioteering, and dance with elephants." The education of the Zhou Dynasty actually planted its foundations with music. The reason is to cultivate one's temperament, to make it harmonious, and to still guide the flourishing vitality, so that scholars can achieve success and everyone knows how to strive for themselves.</p>
<p>After the Qin and Han dynasties, classical music was lost. Those who made music only recorded its drums, dances, and chimes, and the Confucian scholars could not understand its meaning. Not only were rites destroyed and music collapsed, but the education of the Six Arts also declined. In the Wei and Jin dynasties, learning was used to provide eloquent speech. In the Tang and Song dynasties, it was corrected by taking reading as learning the Way. As a result, scholars groaned about their pens without benefiting the world. The foundation of the country was already shaken, and the national character was thus degraded, leading to dispersion, disorder, licentiousness, and weakness. Who can be held responsible? It is all due to the loss of music education. The ranks are not straight, advances and retreats are not uniform, likes and dislikes are not balanced, and people drift away and forget to return. The influence of things on people is endless, and people's likes and dislikes have no moderation. This is what the Book of Music means when it says, "When things arrive, they are transformed in reverse, destroying great principles and exhausting human desires." As a result, there are hearts of rebellion, deception, and falsehood, and there are events of lewdness and rebellion. The strong coerce the weak, the many abuse the few, the wise deceive the foolish, the brave suffer from cowardice, the sick are not cared for, and the old, young, orphaned, and lonely do not get their due. The destruction is heartbreaking!</p>
<p>The purpose of rites and music lies in benefiting the group, and the group's character is based on organization. The key to a strong organization is, first, strength, and second, dynamism. Strength is to sustain its survival, and dynamism is to promote its development. As the saying goes, "To pacify those above and govern the people, nothing is better than rites; to change customs and transform habits, nothing is better than music." Rites have the power of stability, and stability makes the organization strong. Music is rich in the opportunity for development, and development makes the organization dynamic. They must be used in conjunction with each other and work together. When rites are clear and music is complete, they can become self-reliant and never cease. But rites are made from the outside, and music is born from the heart. The use of rites lies in regulating individuals within the common rules, and the use of music lies in expressing individuals within the collective action. Therefore, rites cannot avoid being reluctantly practiced, while music can be practiced in peace. Music is based on movement, with ups and downs, advances and retreats, fast and slow, and sound and appearance are both beautiful, so it is easy to be joyful and follow, and the interests are all raised, so it is naturally moderate. Therefore, the flourishing of courage can revitalize the weakness of will; arranging the ranks can cure the dispersion of body and mind; "advancing and retreating as a brigade" can manage the disorder of things; and peacefulness and harmony can correct the licentiousness of temperament. Chinese culture, spanning five thousand years, although there is nothing that does not return, the scenery is always new, but if music education is not cultivated, it will suppress the vitality too much and will tend to decline and old age, and the crisis of the nation cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the single implementation of rites education is that the atmosphere is solemn, easily flowing into rigidity, and the tendency of conservatism is more, then the courage of advancement is insufficient. Like the seasons, the convergence of autumn and winter is ultimately not as smooth as the vitality of spring and summer. The ancient blind musicians proclaimed that in spring they recite poetry, in summer they play stringed instruments, and in autumn and winter they teach books and rites, which also shows that they follow nature and teach according to the seasons. The relationship between culture and life is often similar. By middle age, there have been many experiences, and experience continues to grow, but creation does not easily attempt. The fact that our culture has reached middle age is a fact, so we must restore the original to restore its innocence, catch up to strengthen ourselves and never cease. It is recorded: "The way of heaven and earth, cold and heat are not always equal." Education is the cold and heat of our people. If education is not timely, it will harm the world." Therefore, adapting to the times and promoting self-reliance and regeneration, music is actually a medicine for saving the world in education.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of overemphasizing rites education is that although the form exists, the essence does not. Overemphasizing books and neglecting application, recognizing the meaning of empty reading, exegesis, and doctrine as the way of metaphysics, and belittling the practical skills of archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic as the skills of metaphysics. The result is that intellectual education cannot benefit the people, physical education cannot bear heavy burdens and go far, and even moral education has less merit in self-cultivation, family governance, and peace, and more merit in writing books and making statements. Pale-faced scholars cannot distinguish between soybeans and wheat, and they cannot govern themselves when used to govern others, and they cannot support themselves when expected to support others. When wielding weapons to defend the country, the path of literary and military arts has been divided for a long time, and there is no strength to defend themselves and others. Tracing the cause, there is more time spent learning to be still than learning to move, and the power of practice is used to study literature, so how can scholars not only have a dying body? How can the world not present a picture of twilight and沉沉? To treat its vital points and revive its wasted diseases, there is no other way to find but to revive music education.</p>
<p>The matter of music involves instruments, sounds, and appearances. The instruments are bells, drums, pipes, chimes, feathers, flutes, shields, and axes. The sounds are songs, and the appearances are dances. Listening to its sounds, the will is broadened; learning its bowing and raising, the appearance becomes solemn; performing its ranks, grasping its rhythm, the ranks are straight, and advances and retreats are uniform. Its teaching is one, and moral, intellectual, and physical education are all contained in it. Changing customs and transforming habits, and shaping temperament, then moral education is good; the hands dance, and the feet step, then physical education exists, and the introduction of Shang and engraving of Yu, dividing skills without loss, five tones and seven rhythms, reciprocally becoming palaces! "The same law measures and balances" is used as the standard, and "coordinating the time, month, government, and day" is used as the basis, then intellectual education is also captured. And its wonderful use is to unify and love, and to be close to all the people. The orderly and unified pace, the harmonious and cordial sound, circulate the spirit. Moving the mind, blood vessels, nourishing moderation and virtue, and saving the deviation of temperament.</p>
<p>When the great cause of nation-building is beginning, music education is enough to wash away flaws and embrace new opportunities.</p>
<p>Mr. Zi's discussion of sounds generally mentions the five: bells, stones, silk, bamboo, drums, and chimes. He said that when a gentleman hears the sound of bells, he thinks of military ministers; when he hears the sound of chimes, he thinks of ministers who died defending the border; when he hears the sound of zithers and lutes, he thinks of ministers with will and righteousness; when he hears the sound of reed pipes and Sheng, he thinks of ministers who raise livestock; when he hears the sound of drums and chimes, he thinks of generals. It is sufficient to know that the sound of flourishing and courage is enough to stimulate ambition, and the dance of shields and axes is enough to discuss military preparations. Therefore, the small self composes poetry, and the hegemony of Qin becomes greater day by day. The Marseillaise is arising, and the French revolution is successful. During the War of Resistance, to plan how to inspire people's hearts and arouse morale, music education has the greatest function.</p>
<p>The function of incense music education, as described above, can restore the foundation of the country with the Six Arts, save the decline of national morality, save the crisis of national aging, awaken the attention of practical science, collect the effect of uniting the spirit, and use the construction of the organizational foundation to eliminate the common hatred of the enemy to meet the needs of the War of Resistance. Therefore, when the second phase of the War of Resistance begins and the education of nation-building is initiated, the urgency of correcting the deviation and the importance of the status are self-evident. Its influence on people is extremely profound, so its effect is also extremely rapid. "The evening drum and morning bell are thought-provoking," and the religious have already known and utilized it before me. Can the enhancement of national motivation not be sought here!</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Oil Mine in Xikang Can Supply the World for 300 Years, Making It the Most Promising Virgin Land for Development; Coal Reserves in Five Provinces Reach Over 80 Trillion Tons <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Kangding Communication] The government has been actively implementing plans for the development of mineral resources in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, with the mining of coal and oil receiving particular attention. Coal and oil are fuels that China currently lacks and urgently needs. Currently, more than 50 official and private companies are working on coal mining, and in the future, production will increase to meet national needs. Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Xikang have the largest oil reserves, and efforts will be made to mine them to curb the outflow of money. It is learned that the current estimated amount of coal reserves in the southwest is 9.874 trillion tons in Sichuan, 1.672 trillion tons in Yunnan, 1.549 trillion tons in Guizhou, 71.950 trillion tons in Shaanxi, and 2 million tons of annual production in Gansu, totaling over 85.045 trillion tons of coal reserves in the five provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Among them, western Shaanxi has the largest amount, ranking second in China. The annual production in the past was 1.4333 million tons, with Sichuan accounting for the majority at 1 million tons. As for oil, according to the survey of foreign experts, the oil reserves in the Ningjing Mountains of Xikang are the largest, and the reserves can supply the world for 300 years. In addition, the reserves in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces also reach 1.357 trillion barrels (one barrel is calculated as 42 gallons), which is 56.994 trillion gallons. Once this astonishing amount of reserves is opened, the profits will be incalculable. Therefore, the development of the rich resources of the southwestern and northwestern provinces, in addition to the coal reserves in the five provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Gansu, the oil mine in the Ningjing Mountains of Xikang is the most promising virgin land for development. This is also included in the government's development plan, so it will be actively mined soon.</p>
<h3 id="e61">"December 25th" in Chongqing <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>A Passionate Commemoration by 700,000 People</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing for This Newspaper] There are three meanings to commemorating "December 25th": (1) December 25th was originally the date of the Yunnan Uprising, which overthrew Yuan Shikai and eradicated the resurgence of imperial ambitions. It can also be seen as a commemorative day for laying the foundation for the revival of China and the establishment of the Republic. (2) It is the anniversary of the Xi'an Incident when the Leader escaped danger. (3) At the onset of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy becomes increasingly weary with each battle, while we become more courageous. In order to strive for final victory, we must unite more sincerely, accept the call of our Leader's great personality and spirit.</p>
<p>Like celebrating the New Year, the streets were lined with large red slogans on every household. National flags with the blue sky, white sun, and crimson ground hung from building tops and windows. Many families also hung four round lanterns. Although there was a constant drizzle from morning till night and thick, muddy ground, the enthusiasm of the general public attending the event was not diminished.</p>
<p>The expanded commemoration of the "December 25th" festival was held in three locations that day. The city district's venue was at the public stadium, a plaza capable of holding over 50,000 people. The meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 4:00 PM. However, by 3:30 PM, it was already packed with representatives from over a thousand organizations, schools, and groups, as well as spontaneously participating civilians, leaving no space to move. Male and female actors from the Central Film Studio, local singers, and latecomers were all excluded, left to sigh from outside the venue. As a result, a human wall formed, extending from Linjiang Heng Street on the left to Chaijia Lane on the right, creating an unprecedented spectacle. Moreover, the areas near the venue and major streets were teeming with spectators, creating a joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>In front of the rostrum, walls and railings were covered with banners dedicated to the Supreme Leader from all sectors. A "hada" (a piece of white silk representing respect) presented by representatives from the 108 Lamas of Lhasa was draped over the Leader's portrait, with foot-long tassels on each end. Looking down from the rostrum, one saw a forest of small flags, portraits of the Leader, lively dragon lanterns, and countless heads wearing straw hats and caps. The rain continued to fall, wetting the heads and feet of the crowd. However, what did that matter? Their hearts were filled with joy and excitement, so everyone stood tall, awaiting the commencement of the commemorative ceremony.</p>
<p>At precisely 4:00 PM, amidst booming cannon fire, the opening ceremony began, proceeding according to protocol under the leadership of Chairman Guo Yuyi. He reported the significance of the meeting, elaborating on the commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising and the Leader's escape from the Xi'an Incident, and solemnly declaring that the commemorative event was purely a spontaneous initiative inspired by the Leader's greatness, character, and spirit, without government orders, and absolutely reflected the true intentions of the people. After the speech, representatives from various sectors marched onto the stage to present flags, totaling over a hundred.</p>
<p>Next, Deputy Director He, representing the Chairman, read Chiang Kai-shek's message: "Today marks the anniversary of my return to Nanjing two years ago after escaping danger in Xi'an. Recalling the initial kidnapping by rebel generals caused endless anxiety among all comrades and the entire nation, who devised every possible way to rescue me, fully expressing their utmost care for the individual and the Party-state, for which I am deeply moved even now. Although my personal safety was a concern at the time, my individual life was of lesser importance. Under no circumstances could the nation be placed in a state of peril because of my personal life. Therefore, I resolved to dedicate my life to the cause in the face of danger, unmoved by intimidation, to preserve the integrity of the world and extend the life of the nation. Now, our enemy, Japanese imperialism, is constantly employing intimidation tactics against us, no different from the situation when I was kidnapped by rebel generals. They merely want us to stop the War of Resistance, accept humiliating terms, and deprive our nation of any hope of revival, turning our descendants into their slaves. I dare to solemnly declare to all comrades and compatriots that I will uphold my long-held aspiration and the resolution I made two years ago in the face of danger, and will never yield to the enemy's ferocious power and allow their delusions to come true. I will continue to lead all comrades and compatriots to engage in a long-term struggle, deal severe blows to the enemy, and complete the great mission of winning the War of Resistance and building the nation. Today, you are all presenting flags to me, which clearly shows your ardent hope for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. While accepting this, I can only work even harder on the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, in order to live up to everyone's high expectations, and hope that everyone will rise up together and advance towards the path of light." This powerful instruction gave us a great deal of excitement and amid thunderous applause, the Chairman's message ended.</p>
<p>Among the guest speakers were General Lu Chao, representative of the National Government, Yang Minshan, representative of the Korean Revolutionary Party, and Aja Jiang Cuo, representative of the Lhasa Tibetan Comfort Team, who all expressed their utmost support for the Leader. Mr. Yang Minshan, the Korean representative, said, "China's War of Resistance is not only seeking the survival of the Chinese nation, but also seeking liberation for our Korean compatriots. Therefore, Korean compatriots have recently established the Righteous Men's Corps to directly participate in China's great War of Resistance. This volunteer corps is just the beginning of Korean compatriots' participation in the war. Now, for the liberation and survival of the two nations of China and Korea, all 33 million people of Korea will rise up together to help in the struggle." This further proves that in the midst of the violent enemy's invasion of China, its internal colonial territories have been fundamentally shaken.</p>
<p>Finally, the conference proposed three resolutions: (1) Seventy million citizens of Chongqing send a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang. (2) A telegram of comfort to the soldiers at the front. (3) Recommend to the central government and the Xingying that "December 25th" be designated as National Revival Day. These were unanimously approved with applause, the cheers reaching the sky. The sound of paper flags waving continued for five minutes. They shouted slogans, and starting in the dim twilight, teams set off on a torchlight parade. The procession stretched for over ten miles. The sounds of firecrackers, singing, and slogans filled the city of Chongqing, and the emotional tension reached its peak. (December 26th)</p>

Yuasa requested that the Emperor first exchange views with Elder Saionji and then report back. Yuasa left Tokyo at 2:00 PM today to visit Saionji, and returned to Tokyo at 9:00 PM this evening. At that time, he directly entered the palace to recommend candidates for the cabinet based on Saionji's opinion. According to follow-up news, the Emperor has summoned Hiranuma to the palace to personally order him to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from Shanghai for this newspaper on the 4th] A Tokyo dispatch reports that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet has been brewing for a long time. In the emergency cabinet meeting convened at the Prime Minister's residence at 9:00 AM this morning, there was a sudden and drastic turn of events. Participants included Prime Minister Konoe and other cabinet ministers. After about an hour of discussion, it was decided that the cabinet would resign en masse. After the meeting, Konoe immediately entered the palace to see the Emperor and personally submit his resignation. At the same time, Minei and Itagaki separately convened meetings of the heads of the Navy and Army ministries. On the Navy side, attendees included Minister of the Navy Minei, Vice Minister Yamamoto, Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau Inoue, and Chief of the Personnel Bureau Shimizu. On the Army side, attendees included Minister of the Army Itagaki, Vice Minister Tojo, Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau Nakamura, Chief of the Personnel Bureau Anan, and Chief of the Accounting Bureau Ishikawa. The General Staff Headquarters also sent Vice Minister Tada to attend. As a result, the two ministries unanimously agreed to maintain close contact through liaison officers regarding the selection of the next prime minister. At the same time, Army Minister Itagaki visited Prince Kan'in Kotohito, the Chief of the General Staff, to report on the cabinet's resignation. After the collapse of the Konoe cabinet, the most popular candidate for the next prime minister is Hiranuma, the president of the Privy Council. Currently, all eyes are focused on Saionji's trip to Tokyo and the meeting of senior statesmen to be convened today and tomorrow. Konoe's Declaration of Resignation</p>
<p>[Tokyo Dispatch of the 4th via Associated Press] After resigning as Prime Minister, Konoe issued a declaration stating, "Japan's policy towards the Sino-Japanese war is entirely approved by His Majesty the Emperor, and therefore cannot be changed. This resignation is because I believe the country needs a 'fresh start.' Under the rule of the new cabinet, the people must concentrate their minds to build a new order in East Asia and resolutely maintain it. I feel that in order to deal with the new situation, we must implement some new measures so that the new cabinet has the responsibility to rely on." He also said, "I feel that my ability is insufficient and I am not worthy to continue in this position, so I will give way to someone more capable. The situation does not allow for any further delay." Interpretations of Konoe's remarks believe that he intends to immediately expand the provisions of the National General Mobilization Law. Even if the law is not fully implemented, at least more of its provisions will be implemented.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing via Central News Agency on the 4th] A Tokyo foreign dispatch reports that Prime Minister Konoe convened a cabinet meeting at 10:31 AM this morning. After the meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM, Konoe entered the palace to have an audience. Afterward, he met with the Chief Secretary and announced that the Prime Minister had submitted the resignation of the entire cabinet to the Emperor. He also declared that the decision to resign en masse was made during the cabinet meeting this morning. Japanese newspapers predict that the new cabinet will be formed by Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō. It seems that three members of the current cabinet may join the new cabinet.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Tokyo via Reuters on the 4th] The Japanese Konoe Cabinet has resigned en masse. Tokyo newspapers predict that Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu and Minister of Finance Ikeda will not be included in the new cabinet, but Minister of Foreign Affairs Arita is expected to retain his position. The stock exchange opened today after a full holiday, and prices plummeted due to the cabinet crisis.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Konoe Cabinet's Resignation</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from Shanghai for this newspaper on the 4th] According to news from North China, after Konoe's resignation, the most likely candidate to succeed him is Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council. The main reason for the downfall of the Konoe cabinet was that Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu, the leader of the fascist military faction, firmly advocated for the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law, which Konoe did not agree with, leading to a decisive break.</p>
<p>[Tokyo Dispatch of the 4th via Associated Press] The Konoe Cabinet submitted its resignation today. It has been learned that Konoe convened a meeting of cabinet members on New Year's Day to discuss the national general mobilization plan. Most cabinet members disagreed, leading to a stalemate and the decision to resign en masse. Recently, Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu has been the strongest opponent of merging domestic political parties and implementing a totalitarian movement under the command of the army and navy leaders. After the dissolution of the Konoe cabinet, the Prime Minister will be succeeded by Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council. The cabinet's resignation is due to: (1) Avoiding the threat of Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu to dissolve the Diet; (2) Dissatisfaction from all parties with the government's increase in military spending by 250 million yuan for China; (3) Difficulty in obtaining foreign loans while the Sino-Japanese war continues.</p>
<p>[Tokyo Dispatch of the 4th via Associated Press] Observers here believe that the Konoe cabinet's resignation is due to Japanese public opinion disapproving of the "national reorganization plan" advocated by Konoe and Suetsugu. The attacks were mainly focused on Suetsugu alone, but since Konoe supported Suetsugu, people generally share the responsibility.</p>

The enemy was caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. The enemy's forces in Guangdong province reached Fogang. Conghua has already been taken by our troops. In recent days, the # army has not been very active, hoping that Wang Jingwei's change of allegiance could promote peace with Japan (?). Yesterday's resignation of the Japanese official will inevitably have a profound impact on the war situation in South China. Regarding Doihara's movements, he is extremely secretive, although there are rumors that he is colluding with various puppets in South China to instigate peace talks, since he believes the Japanese political situation to be dire. Our troops took advantage of the enemy's indecisiveness and launched a simultaneous counter-offensive against the enemy in Sanshui, Southwest, and other areas, with considerable success.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing via Reuters on the 4th] General Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Xingying, declared, "There is a possibility that the Japanese army will land in Beihai.

<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the morning of the 5th] Li Dijun, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told our reporter that the U.S. note sent to Japan on the 31st was stronger and more forceful than before: (1) Stating that the U.S.'s advocacy of the Open Door policy is not solely for commercial interests, but also attaches importance to political and economic stability; (2) Pointing out that the "New Order in East Asia" was created by Japan; (3) Clarifying the U.S.'s understanding of the revision of the treaty and the joint revision of the treaty as illegal. The U.S.'s Far East policy, as seen from this note, is becoming increasingly active.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 3rd] Late arrival, responsible person from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, After the Central government notifies the various embassies and consulates of Wang's [Jingwei] case, the embassies and consulates were very indifferent to this matter and no one felt interested. The Ministry inquired, The recent protests from the U.S. against Japan were issued after Wang [Jingwei]'s announcement (29th), and the wording was even more forceful than before, indicating that the attitude did not change because of Wang [Jingwei]'s affair. The U.S. and the UK have been consistent, so the UK is also without incident. In summary, the quickness with which our central government dealt with this matter, shows that the national policy of resisting until the end is not easy to change, and nobody can change it. Since all countries see that we are able to deal with the situation, there is nothing else to say.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 4th] There has been no special news about the Wang case in recent days.

<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing on the morning of the 5th] Shao Lizi said that whether the central government will make further statements to Japan depends on Wang's future actions.

<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 4th] A certain important person said that the central government has not yet issued an arrest warrant for Wang, which is still lenient. All parties still hope that Wang will not act anymore and betray the nation. It is heard that several people have sent telegrams to Wang in their personal capacities, making a final plea for him to go to Europe to recuperate and await punishment in order to seek the forgiveness of the people.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper] According to sources from relevant parties, Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the country has been met with opposition from the entire nation. The central government has severely punished him, and the international community has not paid much attention. Wang is now very frustrated because this matter has reached a stalemate. He is considering easing the unanimous opposition from all sectors of society. He is also planning to implement a "bitter scheme" by sacrificing his confidants Chen x and Lin x. Gu x will issue a public statement denying that the telegram was Wang's original intention and adding that Chen and Lin made the suggestions on their own authority. Then, Wang will issue a second statement. The content of this statement will still express support for peace, but declare that the previous statement was a suggestion from Chen and Lin, not Wang's suggestion.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 4th] In recent days, generals have telegraphed the central government to support the handling of Wang's case.

As for the situation of the opposition in China, there is no phenomenon that can be said to respond to Wang's telegram. It has no effect on the general morale of China. Chinese people have been strengthened by the preliminary economic assistance given by the United States and Britain, so their resistance is more solid. Observers here have a very good impression of the comparison.</p>

<p>— Our Special Zhejiang Reporter, Geng Ya</p>
<p>"Those not of our 'front' must have different hearts. Grievances have their source, wrongs have their perpetrator, and national and familial hatreds are clearly understood even by village children. This undeniably demonstrates a significant advancement in general national consciousness and cultural standards due to the war of resistance." I had just concluded my conversation about that tearful "Jiangxi fellow" when, diagonally across from me, sat two "Northeast compatriots," also armed comrades, of course. They had just finished eating local grapefruit. One of them, wearing a black leather jacket, raised his voice as if trying to startle everyone, saying:</p>
<p>"Most foreigners bully the weak and fear the strong. The Japanese devils are especially prone to this despicable nature. When they attacked our Xuzhou, damn them, they didn't treat our compatriots as human beings. They killed men on sight and raped women. Some women shaved their heads in advance and disguised themselves as male villagers, but they were still forced to strip for inspection, and ultimately couldn't escape being violated. See how they oppress our ancestors? But every time we surround them on the battlefield, they put on a pathetic act, crying and begging for mercy. The last time we surrounded several hundred of them near Xingzi on the Nanxun Road, they all knelt in rows on the grass, holding their guns high above their heads, as if their parents had died, loudly shouting the slogan 'Long Live the Republic of China' while weeping. Some even spread a handkerchief in front of where they knelt, respectfully presenting gold rings and banknotes looted from our occupied areas on the ground. They thought that by doing this, they could bribe our soldiers and avoid being captured, hoping we would let them go easily. In reality, the Japanese devils are accustomed to playing these kinds of petty tricks, hoping to achieve a seductive effect on the battlefield, which is like a toad trying to eat swan meat!</p>
<p>"However, we have always been ordered to treat captured Japanese soldiers well. We treat the wounded, provide better food than our own soldiers, and try our best to ensure their safety by housing them in foreign company buildings, for example. The Japanese soldiers, for the most part, know how well we treat prisoners, so the more conscious soldiers often take the safe-conduct passes we drop from airplanes and seize the opportunity to escape the clutches of their fascist warlord aggressors, running over to our lines. Some of these more enlightened Japanese soldiers are unwilling to be sent to the rear or secretly return home, and instead wish to join our battlefield work. Thus, we have formed them into a volunteer army and sent them to operate behind Japanese lines. Among them, there are also many patriotic individuals from Korea, Taiwan, Ryukyu, and other places, especially the Korean Nationalist Party volunteer army, who are active in the [unclear] war zone. Each one is loyal and courageous, and their results are very outstanding. As the ancients said, 'Those who lose the Way receive little help, while those who gain the Way receive much help.' This is not only a vivid example, but also a key factor determining our final victory!" Finally, he took out the safe-conduct pass he had on his person, the one used by enlightened Japanese soldiers to surrender to our army, and passed it around for everyone to see. In the end, "forgive me for using the Son of Heaven to command the feudal lords," and taking the liberty of citing readers' need to see it as a reason, I asked him for it to be published as a printing plate. (See attached image)</p>
<p>It was already past two in the morning. The train suddenly stopped and we heard a pheasant crowing at dawn. Our temporary discussion group thus implicitly declared its end, and everyone went to sleep on their seats and chairs. When we woke up the next morning, the train had been stopped in Quanzhou for two or three hours. On the platform, there was a wooden sign stating that the station had air raid shelters capable of holding four to nine hundred people, and that passengers should head towards the designated targets for shelter in the event of an air raid. On both sides of the tracks, along the mountain slopes, newly planted tall pine trees, freshly washed by the night rain, were particularly lovely. Twenty or thirty miles away, there were also tall, towering peaks, glimpsed through the gaps in the fleeting mist, appearing ever higher the more we looked. A moment later, the train whistle sounded a long blast, and the train continued on its way in the rain.</p>
