<h3 id="c1">爭取外交上更在的勝利 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>「爭取外交上更大的勝利」，這是我們第二期抗戰中的重大任務，也是保障遠東和平與世界和平的先决條件。我們必須爲完善達成這一任務而竭盡心力英勇奮鬥。</p>
<p>我們在抗戰一年又六個月中間，曾經在外交上取得那些勝利？我們爲什麽要爭取更大的勝利？並且有爭取更大勝利的可能嗎？我們要爭取那些更大的勝利，而且怎樣去爭取呢？</p>
<p>一年又六個月的抗戰，造成了我國外交上空前勝利的形勢。消極方面，我們從汪兆銘「一面交涉一面抵抗」的政策，達到「停止與侵畧國外交談判」；從南京談判宛平談判的停頓，達到完全停止一切分裂的局部的外交行動更從日×，德大使，親日派等迭次外交談判妥協陰謀的粉碎，達到最近隨汪兆銘叛離祖國而出現的投降主義之德意路綫之總退却。積極方面，我們從全面抗戰的展開與堅持，達到了外交政策的統一明朗，與强硬；達到了「聯合民主和平各國共同反對法西斯侵略者」的外交政策的確立與堅持。綜合上述消極的與積極的外交上的成就，表現在具體事實上的勝利，第一是我國抗日戰爭爭取中華民族自由與維護世界和平的偉大意義，逐漸爲全世界最大多數和平正義人士所理解，所同情，所讚助；第二是日本侵華戰爭的殘酷性野蠻性因我抗戰與外交政策的堅持而益爲全世界人士所痛惡；第三是我國「援華制日」的要求獲得國聯的一致通過；第四是中蘇互不侵犯協定的成立，蘇聯全國遵從國聯援華决議案，給我以精神上物質上的熱烈援助；第五是從美國政府遠東政策的逐漸轉變，援華運動的逐漸積極，影響到美國政府對日妥協政策的逐漸糾正與援華運動的逐漸展開。</p>
<p>過去外交上的成功，是對×不利與對我多利的國際形勢已逐漸發展。是不是還有發展到更加不利於×多利於我的可能呢？我們認爲是有絕對可能的。第一是日本法西斯侵略者勢力在中國在遠東的發展，絕對沒有與英美法蘇各國或其中若干國家成立妥協的可能，相反的，日本勢力發展必然更加增進其和英美法蘇的衝突。這不僅在英法美蘇各國認得淸楚，日本亦不能不自承，據×國同盟社訊，定於明日（二十日）公佈的平沼內閣施政方針，卽將說明其任務在加强侵華，排斥英美勢力；有田外交演說，更將强調此點，卽所謂强化防共協定與完善樹立「日滿支集團的東亞新秩序」。第二是我國全國團結抗戰的堅持，必然更會加强英美法蘇等民主和平各國對于我國最後勝利的信念，及發展援華制日運動的决心。第三是英法英美邦交的更加敦睦和英美法對遠東政策的漸趨一致，必然更將給蘇聯積極援助中國以更大的便利。第四是日德意等法西斯侵畧者更加團結，必然增加英美法蘇等民主和平國家互相依持合作的程度，而更有利於太平洋反法西斯侵略陣綫的結成與進展。</p>
<p>然而截至今日爲止，我國在外交上的勝利還只是一定限度的勝利，這種勝利還不足以解决我國在第二期抗戰中所將遇到的新的困難；同時日本法西斯侵略者在外交上雖然遭遇到空前的慘敗，陷於「四面楚歌」的境地，但是這種失敗與困難也沒有立刻達到壓迫日本統冶者立刻全盤放棄法西斯侵略政策的程度，甚至是日本統治者正在更加瘋狂地走向法西斯侵略的尖端，在這過程中，他們的作惡，會是「變本加厲」的！因此我們絕對不能自滿於過去的初步勝利，我們必須一方面增加日本侵略者前途的困難，使之若非完全放棄法西斯侵略政策，則必促成法西斯侵略機構在內外情勢壓迫下全部崩潰；另一方面又必須爭取我們更大的勝利，達到和平民主各國的親密聯合積極制裁法西斯侵畧者，進而樹立太平洋沿岸以至全世界的集體安全制度。爲完成這兩大任務，我們必須認淸下述各點：</p>
<p>第一，堅决擁護全國團結持久抗戰，是爭取外交上更大勝利的基礎；而熱烈擁護政府「聯合和平民主國家反對法西斯侵略」的正確的國策，堅决反對投降主義者的所謂德意路綫，是爭取外交上更大勝利的最基本的條件。</p>
<p>第二，爭取外交上更大勝利，不能是孤立的聯俄路綫或莫斯科路綫，不能是孤立的英美路綫或倫敦華盛頓路綫，也不能是所謂國聯路綫或日內瓦路綫，我們要認淸蘇聯的和平政策與伕助弱小民族被壓迫民族的政策，蘇聯確是世界和平的支往，特別是中國民族的忠實友人；但是我們更應認淸日益明顯的全世界法西斯侵略陣綫和民主和平陣綫的對立形勢，我們必須把全世界所有反對法西斯侵略的勢力團結到我們友軍的陣營裏來，我們的鬥爭才是更不孤立，我們的勝利才能是更大的而且澈底的。</p>
<p>第三，國聯仍是和平陣綫發動制裁侵畧者的一個機構，因爲這個機構的本身弱點和缺陷，固然不能存何奢望，然而目前國際形勢，則大有利於我國援華制日的運動，現在國聯行政院會議已在開始討論我國的提案，我們必須動員輿論和國內外的羣衆運動，熱烈擁護我國代表的呼籲，在援華部份，我們要求各國更進一步實行對華醫藥，軍火，軍事原料，技術人才的援助：在制日部份，首先要實行停止軍火軍事原料如飛機煤油的輸日，日本輸出商品的抵制等。</p>
<p>此外，我們必須盡一切力量發動與發展全世界和平正義人士反法西斯侵略的聯合陣綫，首先是世界性的以至各國的反法西斯反侵略團體的統一組織，我們更必須盡一切力量發動與發展法西斯侵略家國內部及其統治地域民衆的反法西斯聯合戰綫。只有廣大的反法西斯反侵略運動，和我們全國團結持久抗戰力量的密切配合，才能增加×人的困難，才能完成我國更大最後的勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c2">中華民族的再生 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣宋美齡</p>
<p>倫敦聖保羅大敎堂南面入口之前，有一塊奇特的石碑，上面　刻着一個拉丁字、「ResurgaM」它的意　爲：「我將冉起」。這石碑的來歷是如此的：當這座敎堂的穹頂將要落成的時候，建築師華倫爵士要一塊石頭來　出這建築的中心點，使工人們有所識別。在一堆廢料之中偶而揀到了　塊陳舊的墓碑，上面就鐫刻着這個拉丁宇。它的涵義，使那建築師很受感動，於是决定把這塊石碑築在表面，給它一個永恆保存起來。這塊碑至今還在那裏，凡是看到它的人，心中就不期然而然地興起了樂觀之感。這一個碑文，那麽簡勁有力的一個宇，對於我們，對於目覩着同胞傷亡，家殘國破的我們，尤其富有特殊的感動力，它將要深深地印刻在我們每個人的心頭，鮮明地照耀在旗幟之上！</p>
<p>我們把中國的地圖翻開一看，很容易地就可以明瞭，×人憑了他們優勢的海陸空軍，是怎樣的侵入了我們東部的若十省分，到現在爲止，他們是如何掠奪了我們許多鐵路公路和水道的交通線，如何對　而殘忍地屠殺了我國無數同胞，摧毀了他們的家室，他們的　業，他們的出園；如何使許多人民，不得不長途跋涉來找尋生計，找尋安全的地點來避免轟炸與屠殺。</p>
<p>東部因×人侵襲而受災最慘的各省是我們農產最富文物最盛的區域。</p>
<p>直到最近以前，大家以爲西部各省非忍耐了艱苦的旅行，長途的跋涉，是　遠而不易到達的。住在東部的同胞們，大都把西邊各省看作奇花異阜，由猫野獸以及珍貴金屬的神聖出產地。誰都知道那裏有巍巍的高山，住着原始的土人，這些高山並且是我國若干大川的發源地，但東部同胞却覺到這實在太不容易接近了。</p>
<p>在南京陷落之前，全國同　對這些西陲的遼遠省份，絕少加以注意，可是如今却已有多少萬人民——其中有的是實業界的領袖，有的是學術界的名流，帶領着他們的同事和同學，從輪船，從汽車，或者是步行遷徙了進來。這集體移民的結果，將使四川和其他西部各省，延滯了好久的建設，有加速的進展，這樣在平常或許需要五十年方能完成的事業，在一年中間就可以成功。</p>
<p>我們在這裏的收穫將超出於補償我們的損失。我們將在已經確立的基礎上，迅速地，堅實地締造起一個復興的國家來——一個嶄新的强盛的有力的中華民國。</p>
<p>從前到美國西部去的拓荒者，他們是爲那裏的鑛苗和肥沃的土壤所吸引而去的，然而他們所到的地方乃是未開闢的處女地，我們的西部，雖是那麽遼遠，像向來那樣的難於深入，可是那裏早已建立了文化，居住了稠密的人烟，人們的所以未能開發天然資源，爲了它複折的途徑，險峻的高山，除了長江或較大支流的若十地點有輪舶民船相通外，那裏僅有的交通工具，祇靠苦力或騾馬的蹣跚跋涉，我們的西部跟美國當時西　的不同之點，就是我們西部並不缺乏人力，而祗缺乏技術和交通，換一句話說，祇缺乏促進開發的推動力。如今這一　大量移民，給西部各省帶進了不少的工稈專家來，航空運輸如貫通各省的公路，以及由此經雲南入緬旬，經新疆通歐洲的公路，大大的减少了交迎的困難。鐵路也在推進，到相當時期，可以跟鄰近的西方國家構通起來。</p>
<p>有些人——尤其是侵略我們的×人——他們以爲我國的獨立我國的自主已將到完全消失的末日。還有人以爲我們勁子上套上那奴隸的桎梏，不過是時間的問題。</p>
<p>這些人，不論他們悲觀或樂觀，總是忽略了一個重要的歷史啓示。中國的成爲一個民族和國家，祗因爲　保有一種再生的力量，所以能　克服了　世紀來的天災人禍，仍舊挺立天壤之間，屹然未動。</p>
<p>這種冉生的力量是永不磨滅的。凡是我們的同時代者，都可以看到我們仍舊保有這種深厚的力量，正像我們幾千年歷盡磨拆爲了保衛先人悠久遺產而作長期的　鬥一樣，我們的歷史，寫着不少的事蹟，處處顯出了這種，量的偉大。我們要培養這種力量，利用這種力量，我們絕不讓我們目己這一輩或是朱來的一代蒙上那犧牲了民族生存權利的恥辱。我們的同胞將繼續　鬥下去，生存下去，並且要把我們的民族復興起　，昌盛起來，即使在那名義上淪陷的游擊區域，在萬分艱難的環境之下我們也是如此；在那些區域，×人　誤地認爲他們已掌有了一切，實則不過是轉瞬幻滅的一場春夢而已。這種脆弱的掌握，跟着時間的推移，將一天靠不住一天，結果在我們中華民族英勇奮鬥的壓迫之下，一定非放棄不可！</p>
<p>在西部，我們將用我們那些天生的勇氣，雄邁的肝膽，以及耐久的力量　造一髑新中國來——一個從戰爭的　爐裏鍛煉出來的新國家，我相信她是有應變的智慧的，而且是進步的，不屈不撓而大無畏的。</p>
<p>同情我們的友邦，以及摧殘我們國家的×人，若使他們有相當的想像力，能把過去十八個月來我們不屈不撓的抗戰的特點，加以綜合的考　，那末他們定能看到那個意義深長的拉丁字，同時也在我們中華民國的西部，在我們偉大的長城牆垣上，在我們沿海各省的海岸崖壁上，永遠發着炫耀的光輝。在那奪目的色彩　，交　着先烈所流灑的碧血，大地所燃燒的火焰，我們心靈的慧眼，定能淸晰地看到那個不朽的有着預言意味的拉丁字：「我將再起」，這個簡勁有力的字，就具體地表現了我們中華民族的精神。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日本國內外形勢檢討 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>（續昨日第二段）</p>
<p>最使×人頭痛的便是蘇聯、日本也自認蘇聯是他們的敵人、內閣改組時、軍部也在担心着蘇聯、露出了恐怖的現象、而蘇聯對日態度、我們可以明白、最近蘇聯的拒　日本「漁業談判」、這已表　出蘇聯已在實行對日制裁、至於全國總動員計劃、這完全是軍閥一面要想將財政由財閥手中搶得、作自由徵調、因此財　就不滿意軍閥、在板垣的第五個條件上、想增加國家生　、我們可以調査到日本自戰事發動以來、出口貨貿易和國內工業都受了極大的損失、去年三四月間得到報吿、關於日本紡織、遭受打擊情形、國內外有六百萬錠、以抗戰以來、在靑島毀滅了七十五萬錠、上海三十萬錠、總計三百五十萬錠、到如今損失更大、已經是因爲戰爭而凋敝了、</p>
<p>第六條的要求、是提高國民精神、但是抗戰以來、人民的厭戰、軍人的反戰、他們的戰事、如何　擴大、最近有一件事、可以證明、日本國內已沒有　油、可是機械化部隊、都要汽油、於是只有仰求外人、他們的金庫是空了、要買汽油、沒有現錢、因此乃改用液體燃料、那種燃料是用酒精仲石油代替的、所以不得不多　的播植蕃茨、以二角三分向農民强迫購來、但農民生　蕃署、需要三毫錢、因此非但不能賺錢。反而　本、政府方面、總是一味强制、去年他們國內已有四處發生暴動、這都是日本國內暴露着厭戰反戰和無力生產的繳證、</p>
<p>再　我們國內的×情看起來、去年十二月二十四日、在津浦綫上的靜海、那處×人常常失眠、有一次、十個×兵携帶了一枝機關槍、五枝步槍向我投誠、雖然人數很少、但已足以表現、×兵在戰塲上也是厭戰、最近漢口附近×有一隊因爲發動反戰宣傳、而被×憲兵繳械了、板坦的第七條要求增加對外　易、是日本自發動侵略戰爭以來、日本的對外貿易、只有一天大低下來、所以他的七個要求、只要我們稍稍加以研究、都是自相矛盾、走頭無路的、所以反只能增加日本國內的困難、和促進國民精神的墮落、而國內的革命風潮、也是必然要發生的、</p>
<p>說到我們中國、在我們最高領袖將委員長領導全國軍民、發動抗戰以來、始終是一貫的國策、我們這個國策、三年、五年、十年都是不變的、現在抗戰已達第二期、軍事上的準備、早有佈置、我們土地廣大、民衆極多、現在正加强組織游擊區的民衆組織、加强　擊隊伍、建設游擊區的核心、把×人的後方、作我們的前綫、毫不誇張的說、我們一個游擊核心、至少可以控制×人三個帥　力量、我們有十個游擊區、便可控制×人三十個師團、游擊區的核心愈多、×人是絕對無法活動的、前大彭德懷將軍曾經說到山西五台的游擊戰、×軍用了三師團的兵力、想掃蕩我們游擊隊、結果我們愈打愈强、他們陣亡了一個旅團長、一個聯隊長、而且還有一件趣聞、便是在我們游擊戰區的×軍、他們糧食的供給、都靠飛機運輸、因此我們的游擊隊便化裝了日兵、結果那糧食、都被我們得到了、最近前綫戰况、可以說比剛開始抗戰、還要　烈、譬如武漢失陷後、×軍僅佔去岳州後、就無力進犯長沙、佔據了德　、就無力進犯南昌、這可證明前綫將士戰鬥力的堅强、所以我們今後第二期抗戰的軍事上、是更有把握中、</p>
<p>中國的產業、原來偏重在沿江沿海、但現在已完全遷到了內地、現在是儘量在充實生產、而後方的交通、也在我們不知不覺間完成了許多、這個證明了我們政府是在盡量發揮建設、我在桂林時、曾遇見一位老人、他很誇耀的說：我們廣西人不會修鐵路、而現在也會條鐵路了、所以我們在一年半來的抗戰、在外形上似乎受了損失、然而在內部上却是得到無限的偉大的勝利、助以×人要想用辦法來對付中國是斷斷不可能了、我們已將×人從頭等國通　到最後關頭、再下來、×人一定要「××××」×、（完）</p>

<p>【本報重慶十七日專電】當局今函軍警。嚴禁奸徒造謠　獲以漢奸　、</p>
<p>【本報重慶　約航訊】川省　西南的腹地，距　線千數百里，且爲不設防的城市，年餘以來，耳不聞槍砲的聲音，繼以爲西南　後方，或不致遭受×人的荼毒不圖禍患也到了眉睫，十五日正午過後，鳴鳴的空襲警報已在渝市　出，不旋踵　急警報相繼而來，市民不約而同的向安全地弁避，正在各自尋覓掩護的當中，×機二十七架已抵達渝市上空了。機槍·高射炮·和×機投下的炸彈聲，籠罩了整個渝市，足足過了一小時，解除警報始吿發出。</p>
<p>被炸災區一瞥</p>
<p>在警報尙未解除的時　，人們已像潮水似的　田地下面裏湧，接廚又狠命的朝着對面山上爬，記者當時雜在人叢中，也爬上了一個光兀的小丘，　着丘那邊突出幾個黑煙通的×××，仍完好如故，但它四週的房屋，則糜爛得像蜂窩一樣，尤其那遭難的幾間小屋，十牆與瓦片全成了泥粉。</p>
<p>當警報解除後，記者由小丘上，一氣跑到受難的塲所，在附近的田邊，人們正圍着一隻飛來的斷臂在顫慄，正嘆息，在咒罵，由那擁臂上的細嫩的肉，和那斷有煤跡的黑手掌，可以斷定死者尙是一個少年的工人，但竟給×人這樣殘暴地掉又了他的有用的生命。</p>
<p>似乎有一家遭難得最慘，室內——好像是一個樓倒場下去的——橫地直地躺着七八個受難者，一一個女屍的頭已不翼而飛了，她身上的皮抱、面前的一塊，不知被炸到什麽地方去了。兩個防護團的團員，正守着一個尺來長的嬰兒在　行人了救急法，可憐那無辜的小生命，成了泥做的似的，硬挺挺地躺着，兩眼間微露開的一條縫，牙齒間，以及鼻孔裏。全給泥土塞滿了，腦頂門有一塊乾　了的血包，這樣幼弱的，無能的一個小嬰兒，應該是在它親母的溫軟的懷抱裏，吮吸着它的大糧　安樂地度着它的童年的罷—　我們的萬惡的×人，竟這樣　了他的命。</p>
<p>才這麽幾分鐘的巡視，發兄了我們在一兩間屋子裏死難的兒童，竟有八個之多了，他們的大眞無邪的面孔，全成了東瓜一樣的東西，帶白堊色，浮腫着的，　上沾滿了乾泥土，就像是由地裏剛掘出的。</p>
<p>正打算離開這　被炸區，再往他處巡視的時候，迎面走來了兩個七八歲的兒童，他們淚痕滿面，手携手　走近了那炸毀的房屋，口中喊着『媽媽，媽媽！』我不忍冉聽，我的心在我身中下沉，我只希望那炸掉了頭的女人，不會是他們的媽媽。</p>
<p>關於善後問題</p>
<p>記者巡視災區之後，爲欲明瞭死傷平民的確數，及當局對於慘炸後的措施，特走訪重慶警察局長兼防護團團長徐中齊氏。他吿訴記者：現在死亡人數未能確切統計，但總在二三百的數目。至關於被　民衆及防護團殉職的團員。决請上峯從優撫卹，一面曾將經過情形面謁中樞當局，先作口頭報吿了。當局對本市人口疏散，亦極關懷，幷有所指示。爲着避免將來的無謂犧牲，渝市人口　自卽日起，加緊疏散。凡各機關的公務人員家屬，希望能自　疏散。其餘本市無固定職　市民，卽不必留渝人員，已諭各分局從速調査，必要時决强制疏散，勒令遷移出境。尙望　般市民。一面保存國家元氣，一面看重自己的生命財產，減少無謂的損人與犧牲。</p>
<p>此外防空部對這次死傷平民的撫卹救濟工作，也極爲重視，聞該部第一即將聯合有關機關組織空襲傷亡救濟委員會，俾所屬各地傷亡送渝市民得由該會統籌救濟，第二該部爲疏散及救濟遭受空襲　家可歸的平民，卽將召集本市市府等機關，商　尋覓空地，建築可容數萬人的棚房，賑濟會也允許撥欵補助。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者白雲</p>
<p>四、×人的新進攻是否將開始於西北</p>
<p>我們的國防線，現爲西南與西北，都　我們的國際交通，　重大關係，都爲小能再　的地方。西北的面積極大，戰線極長，由　西綏　經過全部山西的黃河防線，以至豫西鄂西北，都是西北的外圍。×人不能一開始便進攻西安蘭州，必須先做些凖備工作，卽先要能控制這一個很長的外線或這個外線的某些重要部份，那麽他們將由某一處開始進攻呢？還是本線同時進攻呢？我們認爲全線同時進攻，×人的力量辦不到，一定以其主力置於比較重要的一方面，同時在其他方面，作佯攻之勢。這樣，其主力一定是置於置南與隴海中段，以西安爲目標而西犯；同時以一部份兵力，由襄樊南陽五原臨河柳林禹門一帶，佯攻豫西陜南寧夏陜北各地。</p>
<p>×人要達到這種目的，必須做很艱　的準備工作：第一，襄樊南陽五臨等地，决不能垂手而得。第二，爲　便利其西犯的軍事行動，必先打通　漢線，控制以鄭　爲中心的隴　中段，進攻洛陽陜州。然而鄭州潼關間有虎牢與函谷之險，沿線我已拆除各縣　牆建設工事，且豫西地形險要，民性强悍，×西犯必消費相　的時間與力　。第三，晉陜間有黃河大險。全山西散佈　我們數十萬大軍，×專依渡河犯陜，絕非易事，故必一面以　主力由隴海線西進，一面由晉西，渡河，協力前進。不過欲達此目的，必須以極厚的兵力，用於山西　境，首失要進攻晉西北　晉東北，以確保大同這個最重要的後方交通樞紐，其次，要進攻同蒲路與止太路兩側的游擊隊，以確保東南西北的交通綫，最後還要進攻晉中晉東南晉西南與晉南我　軍根據地，封鎖所有的負河波口，斷絕我與後方　絡，置全山西於其控制之下，才敢渡河，才能策　其隴海　西犯的軍事行動。然而要完成這一工作，必須消耗極長的時間與極大的乒力，否則便辦不到。有人說：×人要允進攻陜北，有人說：×人要先攻寧夏；又有人說：×人要先同時攻寧夏與漢中，以達蘭州，對西安取大包圍形勞，這是脫離鐵路線，深入內地的危險路線，而且差不多大部份是山岳地帶，×　的大兵團展不開，重兵器不易用，其艱難較由隴海　西犯更大，何况×人並沒有充裕的兵力可用呢，這樣所以認爲我們：×人進攻西北，以沿隴海線西犯西安的可能性爲人。自然，×人於隴海綫西進受了打擊之後，也有乘虛進攻我兵力比較薄弱之處（如寧夏）的可能，我們不能死板板的　言×人　攻的戰略。</p>
<p>這裏我們要提出注意情報工作一問題。有了確實的情報，才能正確的判斷×情；對×情有了正確的判斷，才能制勝。我們要注意情報的來源和情報員的　力，對每一情報，必須根據當時×我國內外的種種情形，加以止確的判斷。千萬不要把傳說當作情報，不要對每一情報，都不加思索的認爲正確，如此，必貽誤於軍事甚大。</p>

<p>前幾天英意在羅馬舉行談判的時候，德意侵略者在西班牙的遠征軍，曾　領導了一次總進攻，西叛軍　袖佛朗　還大言不慚地宣傳西班，戰事即可結束。但是西班牙政府軍方面，未示弱，他們前綫將士又一次粉碎了法西斯軍隊的猛攻，而且們後方的婦女兒童和老年人，還在×機　炸底下舉行反法西斯示威遊行，壯大全國抗戰的力量。據十八日巴　雜　　，西政府軍的總反攻，業已收復許多要地。對於驕橫無忌的法西斯侵略者實在是一个重大打擊。不過羅馬會談以後，德會侵略者對西班牙的幼奪必更猖狂，這不祗是西政府的威脅，並且也直接影響到　洲各民主國家的安全·歐洲　局的嚴重·同時也會影　到我們的抗戰前途，因此我們一方面希望各國督促國　對此决定符合國際正義的辦法，從法西斯魔手中，拯救出西班牙民主其和政治，一方面要求各國進步人士與政黨·　以全力督促各該政府，在德意侵略軍未盡退出西境之前，各盡一切力量，以保障西政府所需軍火等之得到經常的充分的接濟。</p>

<p>據十八日華盛頓電，「美參議員登臣十七日向國會提出一案，請求通過，內規定卽行取銷政府購　白銀執照的一切權力，滬西保護國內白銀市塲』。這顯然是美國反動勢力對於羅斯福政府的一種『進攻』。因爲美國政府最近的積極反對法西斯侵峪的外交政策，不僅爲　意日本各侵略國家　仇恨，同時也引起國內若干油業棉業　　業與機器業的經營者的反對，正像英國如果實行對日商報復，亦必不免引起自治領五金業與棉毛業中經營日本貿易店所反對一樣，何况國際法西斯和國　若　反動集團還正利用一切，特務組織與「輿論　關」進行反攻呢，不過就最近事勢而論，這些反動勢力現在已經大爲衰弱，而法西斯侵略者的威脅，已在　國　　羣衆以至較大工商業者中間，　成非常恐怖任何反動力量，終將敵不住。反對屠殺與掠奪的時代的洪流。</p>

<p>日本在中國的亂施亂爲，沒有法律可言，祗是武力高於一切吧了。所謂戰區的宣佈，排斥一切第三國的人民，試問有何法理的根據？一九三八年十月六日美國的照會日本，就是因此而發的。</p>
<p>這個照會很重要的，不獨在美國的外交政策上是重要，而且在應付中國未來的外交政策上，更爲重要。一九三七年十月六日國聯大會所通過的報吿書，癸國完全表示贊同。這個報吿齊謂日本的行動，「旣不是根據現行的法理，又不是根據自衞的權利，更與一九二二年二月廿六日簽訂的九國公約與一九二八年八月廿七日簽訂的巴黎非戰公約，大相違背』。同年十一月比京召集的會議，也無具　的辦法去履行九國公約，祗於一九三七年十一月二十四日發表一個宣言，日本的眞面目，還不大揭破的。一九三八年九月十九日國聯行政院邀請日本參與會議，依國聯盟約第十七條討論中日的衝突事情。九月二十二日日本正式拒絕參加，於是在三十日國聯行政院通過一個議决案，謂：『日本拒絕參加會議，依照盟約第十七條第三項的規定，聯盟各會員國可以履行盟約第十六條，根據盟約第十六條個別行動」。十月三日日本外交部卽發表下面的宣言：</p>
<p>「根據第三項的規定，國聯承認中日兩國之間，有一個國家有戰爭發生，實與各會員國以前聲言在中國無戰爭發生的態度不符。日本政府甚爲重視之。『而且，如果任何國家根據行政院的决案，對日制裁。日本將採行反制裁的步驟，以資答覆。』</p>
<p>十月六日美國的照會日本，與美，法，英的聯同向日本抗議，同等重要的。</p>
<p>以上所述，是歷史上第一次數個國聯會員國，一致以非戰爭的方式對付二個侵略國家。依照國聯盟約，日本戰爭而中國則否。因此，從邏　上言，日本不受平時國際公法的限制，但中國則受　保護。國聯宣佈日本戰爭而中國則否，是以美國總統沒有履行中立法的義務。</p>
<p>但是，這種狀　與美國的政策互不相關的。其他的國家可以肯定的採取較爲有效的行動，施行其衛護自己權益的政策。日本已經進一步的摧殘各國在華的利益了。</p>
<p>究不論美國領導行動與否，各條約國都要一致的，因爲日本：（一）直接間接的歧視佔領區域中的非日本人的商業與投資，（二）獨佔佔領區　中的市場，使非日本人的合法工業也不能立足，（三一）日本干涉佔領區域中各國的財產和權益，包括交通，旅行，居留等法益。</p>
<p>日本答覆十一月十八日美國的抗議，猶巧言令色，曉曉置　。此刻美國當然不承認日本「根據遠東的國際公理以建設　秩序」的行動。亦不相信「此爲日本生存的必需條件」，和這個「維持遠東和平和安定力」的政策。美國朝野當然一致反對。對於所謂「軍事行動中有時不能避免」的破　美國人民的利益，亦大加擊。美國人士又一致聲請政府，否認日本一手所造成的僞組織。</p>
<p>最低限度，美國要停止和日本通商，作爲日本損害美國在華的商業活動及蔑視國際公法的報復。</p>
<p>一九一一年二月二十一日，日美簽訂的商約就是現在日美通商的根據。」</p>
<p>這個商約美國給與日本最　國的待遇，但現在日本則摧殘其在中國佔領區域中的美國商業和財產。自從一九二三年後，這個商約日本曾宣吿廢約六個月。現在美國人士要一致要求美國政府立卽官吿廢約，以答覆十數年前日本廢約的舉動。</p>
<p>執　至此，全美論輿均主張履行九國公約，以制裁日本。但日本則反謂此爲『不可行的觀念和陳　　原則」，是不適宜於解决目前的中日糾紛的。</p>
<p>美國的人士會推動政府，維持這些觀念和　際原則嗎？最好的辦法就是除了道義之外，還要實　援華。美國能够每月將十萬元的軍需品運往緬甸些安南，轉運中國政府或？一（續完）。</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>過海碼頭一種新興的生意</p>
<p>你香港到尖沙嘴，或由尖沙嘴渡香港，趁着××輪船公司的小火輪三等位的票價，是四個銅板，但給他半角　幣，沒找續，一毫錢祗拿回銅板五枚，同樣的從油麻地，旺角，或者深水埔搭小火輪到香港，雖然是比尖沙咀便宜一個銅板，但半角銀幣找一，一毫找六，這又是誰也知到的事·一般婦　，不甘吃虧，常常惹起了很多的爭吵·可是笑　由他笑　，賣票的倒是「坐享其成」！</p>
<p>所以一般渡海者，除去無知婦孺外，大多數都是在碼頭買報或買其他東西·換了銅板纔搭船，不甘給賣票的沾光。因爲這樣，便　出一種一找仙過海」的新興生意來了。這幾天來，在尖沙嘴的火輪碼頭，便見一羣十一二歲的孩子，兩手握着銅板，向渡海的客人喊着「找仙過海」兜攬生意］。大家都以爲這些是販報的小　，大槪因爲銅板太多想找換銀幣的，便紛紛的掬出「一毫子」來，可是半角又是找四，等你追問他的緣由時，　已背轉身跑開；一面走，一面說：「橫豎你都是吃虧的了，給我們也比給費票的好呀！」客人這時　知上了當。不禁破口大罵，可是他們也採取了賣蔡者的態度，笑　由他笑駡，好歹我自爲之！他們日中所獲，倒有幾毛錢至一塊錢。</p>
<p>從此尖沙嘴渡海輪的票房是耳根恬靜了，可是碼頭裏唇槍舌劍，又比前熬閙起來。賣票的眼望着生意給人搶盡了，不禁一怒髮冲冠』；可是這羣小羣小孩完全都是頑童小隊裏的人物，平素賣餅賣茶，躱避「　者」已慣，警差到來，一哄而散，賣票的倒沒他的法了呀！</p>
<p>這種新興的玩意意！找仙過海，本小而利大。當然人爭趨之，相信不久的將來，油麻地，旺角，深水埔而至香港，一定也佈滿他們的踪影的。那時節，賣票人眞是啼笑皆非啊！</p>

<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>和後備警察與救傷隊</p>
<p>香港政府所辦的民衆運動，有着較長遠的歷史，較大的規模的要算義勇軍，後備警察和救傷隊了。</p>
<p>香港陸軍義勇軍的名譽總指揮是港督。現任義勇軍總指揮是羅期中佐。副總指揮是美卓爾中佐。義勇軍總司令部在花園道，和輔政司署隔鄰。</p>
<p>現有義勇軍，全體官兵人數約八百餘人。</p>
<p>義勇軍的編制分（一）義勇軍總司令部；（二）第一炮　　（三）　二炮隊；（四）工程隊，（五）機關檢營，下分　隊：電單車隊一隊，機槍隊四隊，第四隊隊員多屬華人；（六）通訊隊；（七）步兵隊；（八）高射炮隊；（九）輜重隊；（十）軍醫隊；（十一）軍需處；（十二）補充隊；（十三）後備軍官；（十四）鐵道管理隊，他們守着『軍隊中廚子也要能够燒槍』的敎訓。輯　隊，軍醫隊……等都要經過嚴格的作戰訓練。</p>
<p>凡僑居本　的　人，英藉人（不論何國人凡入英藉或在英屬各地出世者作英藉人論，在本港出世的華人或葡人亦昨英藉人論，以下仿此）。都可以加入義勇軍，不徵收費用，一切軍服皮鞋，防毒面具，軍械及其他一幼軍用品都由政府發給。</p>
<p>平時每星期需受訓練一次，分隊訓練，時間是　星期中的一日（日期由該隊選定），下午六時，每年冬季例有扎營大演習一次，地點是新界錦田。當駐港海降空軍舉行每年冬季大演習時，義勇軍要合演習，扣任防守香港。</p>
<p>現在義勇軍中有英人，英藉華人，葡人，印人，和白俄……他們是商人公務　或洋行，銀行的職員。</p>
<p>海軍義勇軍，總部設「禾花一艦上。這艦現　灣仃高士打道對出，奇律小島之西南海面。陸上辦事處在廣　銀行大　內。</p>
<p>海軍義勇軍的名譽司令是港督，司令官現任人是比提利上校。敎練是夏拔少校。入伍辦法和陸軍義勇軍一樣。現有官兵人數約二百餘人。後備警察，總部在中央警署，全體歸警察司經享利指揮。現任後備警察警司是參堅。</p>
<p>後備警察的組織分（一）總部，（二）華人隊，（三）印人隊，（四）警車隊，（五）電單車隊。華人隊辦事處在必打行內。印人隊辦事處和警車　的辦事處在雪廠街二十號，電單車隊辦事處在盧　道。</p>
<p>入伍手續很簡單，凡在本港居住的英籍人那可以參加，現有全體警官警員人數約三百人。他們有的是商人，有的是公務人員或洋行職員。</p>
<p>所有一切用品，像制服槍械……等，和費用都由政府供給，加入電單車隊，則要自電單車。</p>
<p>當後備警察的義務，除平日參加訓練外，在冬防時期　戒嚴時，要受警司指揮，出釆　合正規警察，担任巡査市面，保衛治安。</p>
<p>救傷隊，是英國聖約翰救傷隊。海外支隊之一，現在總監是莫理士，總部在銅鑼兩大坊村。</p>
<p>全體長官，醫生，隊員等共五百餘人，分十三分隊，計開中華基督敎靑年會分隊，英皇書院舊生分隊，九廣路分隊，印人分隊，九龍分隊，旺角分隊，　箕灣分隊，摩托車聯合會分隊，中華體育會分隊，九龍靑年食，隊，南華體育會分隊，灣仔分隊，中區分隊。每分隊設醫生一人至若干人，分隊　督一人，隊長一人至若于人，担任敎練。訓練時採用分隊，分班制。</p>

<p>救傷隊，凡居留本港的靑年男女都可以加入，不限英籍，現在救隊中，華人佔最多數，印人，葡人等佔少數，他們多是學生。</p>
<p>加入救傷隊，要先向總部請求，由總部指派往某一分隊學習，或由某一分隊隊員的介紹，直接加入某一分隊學習亦可。經過幾星期的　習，考試及格，領到文憑便是正式的救傷隊。以後的義務是，參加訓練，隨時地執行救　職務，義務施種洋痘和時疫　行時協助衞生當局施行防疫注射……等。</p>
<p>最近他們還有防空防毒的學習，準備非常時期帮助社會，　行防空防毒救護工作。</p>
<p>救傷隊的服裝用品等，都是由隊部供給，不徵收費用。</p>
<p>義勇軍後備警察和救傷隊都是有地方性的，三個組織都是純粹屬於香港，——義勇軍負責防衞香港，後　警察協助警察維持香港治安，救傷隊担任香港社會救傷衛生工作。</p>

<p>編者按、這是中山大學一位朋友寄給本報記者的一封信、內容報吿從香港經安南到廣西龍州一路的經過、生動有趣、特　之發表以　讀者、</p>
<p>××××諸兄、</p>
<p>芝巴德在下午四時起碇、可容四百人的艙位、祗有我們十二旅客、船中精於計算的先生們、把他劃分數部、這是飱廳，這是會客室、這　讀書室、甚至中央還　了一個跳舞場、不期在水上開起大旅店來了、</p>
<p>一路風平浪靜、頭也不　、肚也不痛、和廣州灣猪屎淋頭的情形相比、雖不能說一相去霄壤」、至少也有從衛城道到干諾道的距離、</p>
<p>因爲平安、所以飯也吃得下、話也說得出、××兄的查腸、××兄的爾果、××兄的橘子、都裝入　皮、「食適飲和」格外感謝、</p>
<p>大艙和三等同一地位、所差者、大艙須備帆布床、吃飯祗有三飱、三等有床而多一飱、這十塊港洋合二十隻大洋、花去是不值得的、奉勸××兄來時、如不願坐二等還是請君入「大艙」、</p>
<p>三十一日晨到海防、船泊在碼頭不動、先有人來把護照取去、醫生則始終沒有來騐、各人的行李都搬上碼頭、最好在船上先托一家旅店照料、據弟所知、以二天然」旅店　靠得住、待行李搬齊、海關中的人把我們連人帶物像一羣鴨　、趕進一座海關的大房子、靜候檢査</p>
<p>房子又黑又擠，空氣臭又濕、最好帶點八封丹、免得給　悶出病來、</p>
<p>行李檢査極嚴、一絲一縷的把它翻出來、安南×又可惡、看到中意的東西、就偷偷地！袴子袋裏塞進去、所以必須親自監視、免得不翼而飛、</p>
<p>凡是新的東西如衣服、布匹、化裝品、藥品、都被它拿去、預備抽稅、他們取出時、千萬要他們寫收條、一位浙江大學的學生不知道這種規矩、半箱東西、盡付東流、幾乎哭了出來、</p>
<p>這一張收條、好好收藏、下午或第二日、　旅店中人陪你上海關納稅、把東西領出、</p>
<p>我這一次、因爲有領事向海關說了一聲、所以全部免驗、雖然內中原沒有什麼東西、却可以免却不少麻煩、總算額角很亮、</p>
<p>還要特別注意的、千萬不可帶火柴和針、火柴一匣、罰越幣二十元、××兄是抽煙的、臨上岸摸一下衣袋、不要在預算上多一筆「赤色數字」啊、</p>
<p>行李檢査完了、隨旅館中伙計上旅館、這一路須提防三隻手、尤其是帽子眼鏡、一不小心、就要來『落帽風」陣、「帽子不知何處去」了、旅店還算公道、一天連飲食收越幣一元五角、行李上落每件一毫、護照簽字交一會館費」銀七毫、</p>
<p>海防看上去和中國其他地方沒有什麽分別、本來、原沒有什麽分別啊、安南人、紗長衫半截、長袴子一條、道冠、木屐、　　然頗有畫中占人的風緻、可惜身村瘦弱、眉目不揚、比起吃大塊牛排、喝大　卑酒、挺胸凸肚、皮鞋　　的人、很月在這世界民族上、劃一條界線、立分涇渭的、</p>
<p>那邊人口不多、街上很寂寥、道路相當半坦寬暢，我尤愛二旁密茂的樹蔭、西洋人能愛樹木、而且勤種樹木、這眞是他們的好處、安南人使外面進去的人最討厭的地方、是嚼檳榔、每一個人的上下額、都蠕蠕而動、好像反芻動物、嚼了半天、一大口血水、傾注出來、沿路吐去、因此一路上血跡斑斑、骯髒得很、他們食久了、非但滿口牙齒、都成黑種、而且身十還有一種奇怪臭氣味、聞之作嘔、這眞是一種壞慣習、</p>
<p>如果海關和護照簽字、沒有什麽留難、海防可不必住夜、一直搭車到河內、安南的車子較國內的小而窄、一二三等有行　車、　等行李須隨身帶、因此搭四等反而可以自己照料行李、亦一好處、</p>
<p>三等和四等相比、搭三等車也不値得、非但車費　上一倍有餘、而且行李費也貴上一倍、而座位都是硬木板、何苦坐三等呢、行李的限制、每人可帶三十公斤、過此、多一斤算一斤、論路途遠近來計算、</p>
<p>我在三十一號下午一時搭車到河內、一直到晚上八點多才到、仍舊有天然旅館的伙計來接客、</p>
<p>年年是在河內過的、</p>
<p>元旦日一個人　遊河內、先到皇家公園、那邊樹水扶疏、規模有相當闊　、裏面還有小型的動物、有一隻白額金　的老虎、擺來擺去、踏着方　、一些沒有「山君一威嚴、到像一位敎書先生、</p>
<p>出了皇家公園到西湖、聽了這個名字、　有些「專（草頭）魚（盧旁）之思」、那天朔風凜烈、一河碧水、寒光照人，旣沒有長堤嫩柳、也沒有遠山　嵐、如果家鄕的西湖是處子、那末這裏的祗好算她作寡婦了、</p>
<p>從西湖析到劍　、那是在市中心、湖中間有一座廟宇、其旁又有一座頽塔、湖邊花　很鬧、廻　廣州　市景象、眞有往事如昨、不禁低徊、</p>
<p>這樣行了一周已過二小時、黃包車每時一毫　、所費僅三毫而已、</p>
<p>我國僑民、生意上很有力量、有一條廣東街、人行其間、幾乎疑心是在永漢路高第街、</p>
<p>從內河到龍州、還沒有直接的火車、須先到瓊山或同登、然後搭龍瓊路的公路汽車直　、</p>
<p>我在二號早上六點鐘、搭車出發、到同登是中午十二時、自海防以後、一路沒有什麽檢査、</p>
<p>同登是一個山村、以前中國名字　「文淵、那是中越接壤的地方、一座火車站、旁邊一座海關、孤立在　野裏、小市　離此約半里、祗有二條街、近來因爲車運較繁、才有三數家小客棧</p>
<p>丰進旅店、迎門而坐的都是鴨舌帽、紐領暢開穿着一條大工人袴的司機、一口『阿拉』話、高談闊論、四周圍着許多婦人女子、如衆星之拱北斗、令人想到華盛頓歐文所描寫村閒馬車夫不可一　的高傲景象、</p>
<p>村外滿滿的停着各色汽車、這小的山村、居然變成交通的總匯，因爲下午沒有車上龍州、到鎮南關閑逛</p>
<p>一路上山峯連綿、左面是削壁、右面是山谷、行時如沿古城牆、別有蒼凉之感</p>
<p>約五公里、看見一座古色古秀的關隘迎在面前、正面匾額上是鎭南關、牆邊放着四塊大石、寫着『南疆重鎭」四字、是陸榮廷寫的、關的背面額上有「拱極門」三宇、一入門就是對汎督辦公署的分署、車子入龍州境、便須在此停車、檢驗護照了、</p>
<p>在關面前眺望安南、左右山脈、向二邊迤邐、正好鑲着二條公路、正面山峯拱立、好像天然的屏障、因這雄壯的地勢、追想到先世的工業、不覺神往、</p>
<p>沿路見一般安南工人、面目黧黑、形容枯槁、深深地表顯寄人籬下的苦處、</p>
<p>三號因爲等車、又多住了一天、四號中午才搭上龍諒車、又回到母國的懷抱中了、一路見一溪一山、都倍覺親切、</p>
<p>在暮色蒼茫中、馳進了龍津縣治、那平坦暢闊的馬路、那二旁茂密的蔭樹、已吿訴我們龍州也已近代化了、</p>
<p>師範學院、研究所的同人、因爲隨着校船、還滯留廣西途上、沒有來到、祗有××老師一人、小別三月、在黃昏燈下、驟然見面、眞是驚喜交集、</p>
<p>到第二天、一個人姗姗其來、他是搭車先行的、握手睇視、如隔十年、兄等情意、都一一轉達了、他聽了也喜歡得了不得、</p>
<p>這裏連日陰雨、頗有一點寒意，温度表在華氏四十以下、所以××兄等不要以爲南疆苦熱、什麽衣服都採取放棄政策啊、</p>
<p>×老師又到河內轉往昆明了、我們因爲等車遲行一步、大約一二日內也須即到昆明、一</p>
<p>龍州市面並不大、又因爲怕警報、十一時前街上爾蕭條條、簡直沒有市面、但物價高得很、比廣州差不多要高出二倍、因爲「難兄』太多、供不應求之故、</p>
<p>中山公園面積相當大、以前是伏波將軍駐兵之所、登　山之頂、仰首遙望、雲海山波、浩浩蒼蒼、想到我們民族久遠偉大的功業、總有振作的一日、不禁昂首一噓、</p>
<p>因爲心不安定、所以不能安坐下來多寫、這信是　匆寫下來的、草草從事，叨在老朋友當能鑒諒、</p>

<p>廣州陷落之翌日、梧市即宣布戒嚴、各要隘增設防禦工事甚多、繼復疏柜市內老弱婦孺、因難民由粤人桂者、異常擠擁、當局爲利便避難民衆之入境計、暫免船舶入口撿查、惟是旅館酒　、則仍然執行檢査、凡行客至梧、如係寄寓旅店者、祗准住宿三天、逾期須覓當地商店或有職業之戚友保證、其意殆防好也、　市人口雖　令疏散、但數量反日增加、蓋由粤西上避難者、均以梧市爲集台點、　場營業、上午頗爲冷、下午及　間、則如常暢旺、緣上午須避日飛機之侵襲故也、入口貨如火油，紗、火柴、呢絨、布疋、棉毛織品、捲煙、洋　麵粉等，較廣州未陷前貴一倍以至兩倍、省內物產、如榖米、猪、　、鴨、牛等、則特別低廉、上米每百、僅沽大洋五元餘以至六元、猪每百斤沽大洋十四五元、雞每斤沽大洋二角五分、蓋因下游交通梗塞、內地物產供過於求、故入口貨重而出口貨平、然而農民經濟、不免大受影響、至省內交通、如桂林、柳州、南寗、龍州、百色等、雖因軍運繁忙、而輪　往來、未嘗窒塞、省外運輸、雖大受影響、惟由龍州至越南、南寗至北海、　林至廣州灣、尙可通行、但遠道迂迴，運費殊不經濟耳、日軍佔據廣州後、桂省已受嚴重之威脅、其所負抗戰之　、更形加重、十一月初旬、白副總司令、曾由北綫前方遄赴　林、召集各路指揮官及高級將領、面受機官、同時省內軍事政治、亦從新調整、某處宜駐重兵、東縣劃爲警備區域，某人指揮某路、與及各縣游擊隊之編配、車輛之轉運、餉精器材之籌集、均有精密佈置、同時政治方面、準備於二十八年一月、全省各縣實行民選縣長、在未民選之先、自本年（二十七年）十一月份起、凡接近粤邊毗連戰區之各縣縣長、一律派遣各該縣原籍之人士充任、如懷集，蒼梧、岑、容縣、桂林、聨縣等、均已實行、又限本年底成立縣參議會、各縣所屬之區鄕鎭村街各長、一律由所屬地方　衆推選充任、實行縣自治制、以前各縣覊　之逃避徵兵家屬，統限於十二月水日起、一律釋放、蓋以時局危急、達於極度、當局極企望軍與民打成一片、合作救亡、故軍事政治、兩方面均從事革新也、（完）</p>

<p>參茸均爲補劑用藥、兩者均爲我國東北著名產品、吉林所產之參、與關東所產之鹿茸、尤稱珍品、此外還有　鮮產之高麗參、蘇俄產之雜參、功效均比不上我國國產、至北美之　旗參、其性質則爲淸凉劑、茸則有鹿茸、麋茸及鹿尾數、市面所售、全爲我國東北所產、</p>
<p>本港參茸貿易額每年達幾二千萬元、近以種種關係、此種數字、一落千丈、尢以東化　爲最顯在全盛時期、本港年銷東北參茸達四五百萬元、現退縮不滿百萬元、花旗參　銷千餘萬元、現祗得回五六百萬元、而蘇俄之雜參、前銷　八十億元、現亦　至二三十萬元、</p>
<p>本港　茸貿易、運銷各地者佔全額百分之八上、本地化銷者僅佔百分之二十、東北參葺銷路除兩粤外、南洋及新舊金山均有、而花旗參則以運　南洋爲大宗、兩粤各地次之查東四省自淪陷後、恐游擊隊潛伏于各地山林、對於時械入山行獵者、絕對禁止、而人參之採取、亦連受影嚮、故　年東北參茸出產短少百分之六十、兼以交通關係、販運不易、故市塲益形不振、至花旗來源雖不受影響、但以戰事關係、內地市塲隨之消失、現祗靠南洋爲尾　耳、統計本港參茸貿易、自中日　事發後、平均短去三分之一</p>
<p>朝鮮之高麗參、價格較平、故　銷路極爲普遍、每年銷額約値六七百萬元、運銷以兩粤爲多、自七七事後、國人以仇貨視之、威不過問、而本港參行及洋莊均停止定購、並將各號國存舊貨，一律由行會封存、限期賤賣、現目本港市場、已無高　參踪跡矣、</p>

<p>（本報特訊）本屆麗華盃之初賽期，已　定在本週末舉行、計　期六下午三時半、山陸軍聯隊與西文員　隊對賽於對海紅　九龍足球會球塲、星期日下午三時半、　由華聯隊　海軍聯隊於跑馬地香港足球會球塲、兩賽俱賽足九十分鐘、取淘汰制、到時必有　常精彩之表演者也、</p>
<p>載於昨日止、四強旅之人選、獨文員隊　經選定而已、至於華聯隊人選、雖　一度選出，惟足　總會視當選者號召力容有木足、　影嚮總會之收入而於地口召待菲律賓來港　隊爲有礙、徽示遴選委員應進行遴選、並擬敦請李惠堂出場、遴選委員據此已有最近　行挑選之　、故華聯隊亦未能視　　選已定也、至若海陸軍兩聯隊、在昨日以前、仍未選　也、</p>
<p>據筆者機悉、陸軍聯昨方產生、勢力亦相當强勁。所可異者、則正前　竟　米杜　之皮亞臣而選及之輯軍需隊之文頓　已、至若守門員之選用九，會之劾利、在筆者已早視爲意中事、蓋其人自由米杜息步兵隊調人打旗　後、雖因打旗隊無甲組足球隊而改隸九龍會旗卜出賽、然身爲軍人、遇文員與軍人聯賽時自應重人軍人隊內、而環顧今之陸軍守門員、又無有球藝能出其右者故也、</p>
<p>照今陸軍聯與文員隊之實力以觀、則陸軍似較爲堅實、然文員代表多九龍會中人、而賽事適又在九龍會球塲舉行、則文昌實得地　之宜、是該隊似又可因此點而能予陸軍以相當之威脅、未可知也、茲餘兩隊人選於後、【球場舊侶】</p>

<p>麗華杯初賽的華聯代表、爲　應足球總會之需求、將另行選拔、</p>
<p>昨天我已有一個擬議、陳綫如下、</p>
<p>譚均幹　羅偉權　侯榕生　許竟成　梁榮照　宋靈聖　侯澄滔　　文治　　患堂　　石金　陳炳土</p>
<p>我這個純粹客觀的擬議、相信十九可得選拔委員的同情、</p>
<p>惟聞宋靈　足傷未愈、恐不能入選、那末、前衞綫又費考慮了、</p>
<p>若靈聖果未能入選、朋應用梁榮照居右、許竟成居中、羅偉權居左、員於左內　、就須選苗華國，</p>
<p>桑楡兄主張榮照打右內衛，與華國搭擋、這亦是一得之見、</p>
<p>竊以爲、榮照不彈此調已久、一旦　守內　、未必比　榕生演出特　、</p>
<p>尤須知、前衞綫乃全隊的脊骨、在目下情形而論、華聯必須使衞綫力　充實、策應前　、　　上策、</p>
<p>我終嫌華國動作慢、恐不見抵禦海聯的岩士德郞、惟低權若以靈聖足傷而其仍充前衞、則捨　國外，左內衛再找誰人呢、但水然警察的陳光裕又如何、因他是中國人、可有入選的資格、故我又有一個擬議如下、</p>
<p>譚均幹　陳光裕　侯榕生　羅　權　許竟成　梁榮照　侯澄滔　鄒文治　李惠掌　卓石金　陳炳土</p>
<p>桑楡兄又主張用劉始　在右前衛、果如靈聖却選、用始　固無問題、惟有用始讀而調榮照打內衛、我認爲這些尙須考家、</p>
<p>我的主張、　爲不大信任華國可以掣肘海聯的右翼、遂提　宜用　權或光裕打左內衞、仙光裕能否膺選、則非我所知，照理可能也、（球出太歲）</p>

<p>娛樂…馬可波羅游記</p>
<p>The　Adventure　of　Marco　polo</p>
<p>本片是以我國元朝忽必烈時代作　背景、而以威尼斯商人、馬可勃羅到華經商的經過、作爲本片的故事、是一部俱有歷史性算、而不能當　史片看的影片、因爲大部份情節的胡調、實令我們不敢置信、監者與導　一、對本片所採用的態度、雖一則相當嚴正、但爲迎台一設一美國觀　的心理、而以　愛一絲勉强的穿揷、完全破壞了　本片歷史的意　、不然、本片。　壯麗的佈景、考究的服裝、與及大力圖斧偉大緊張等戰爭場面、對於元朝忽之列時　的表現、已是做到相當成功的了、</p>
<p>嘉萊中柏在本片飾一威尼斯商人，千辛萬苦才從歐洲到達北京、因爲他對女人的特殊經驗、遂得忽必烈歡心幷受　用、出人宮禁，調情胡閙、後忽必烈出征日本、奸臣作亂、還虧他冒險請救　、除　臣，匡扶皇室、這素　可能的美國明星、在本片中的　出、一本他打情賣俏、風流瀟洒的作風、</p>

<h3 id="c60">傅山的民族精神 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>全祖望著的陽曲傳先生　略，這富於民族會識的作品是足供我們參考的。固然，全祖望是個民族主義的作家，寫成這樣的民族主義的文學、原是他自己的富有民族思想的人格　表現；利用了傳山的事跡就是·——當時已經有了馬世奇的傳山傳，全祖　重行給傳山做起事略來，實在是重於民埃精神的表揚的。但在這里，　着全祖望所寫的，我們總得說是傳山的民埃精神。</p>
<p>在明朝的遺民看來，滿洲人是外挨。帮助外族來　絡同胞的是漢奸、本身就是奴隸、傳山不肯做漢奸，不願伊做奴隸，始終不同滿淸　協，滿人入關、爲着奉養母親，他就深居山中。不但不媚外求榮，無論怎麽樣，百般把結他也是無效，對於外族，他是毫不客氣的一點也不肯敷衍、康熙十七年，開所謂博學鴻詞科。「大河以北、莫能窺其藩者」，傳山的學問是够好的，聲望也是够大的，所以李宗孔和劉沛先，兩個，都就把他薦—上去。　在一般　　的文人、認爲千載難逢的機會，是求之不得的：傳山可不願意去。不去並不可以隨便、滿淸政府硬的要他去，他託病，就把他　牀抬去、到了離京城三十里的地方，他以死作抵抗、不肯入城、停起來了，於是大大小小的官員爭先恐後的來見他。一槪不理、他只假病躺在牀上，對于那些自名好賢的人，視若無睹：原來、在外族下面做事的，大官大走狗，也是大漢奸，大奴隸；小官是小走狗，也就是小漢奸，小奴隸；這在明白的人，當然是看不　的。</p>
<p>那些大小無恥之徒的羣醜中，有個馮溥，自動爲傳山到滿淸政府裏去說好，不參加考試，也給傳山官職；說妥以後一定要傳山道謝，多方的　駕、傅山堅决不肯；於是又把他抬走；到了宮中，又把他挾起來使他行禮；但他只是顧自仆在地上，終於一點也不妥協。</p>
<p>當傳山隱居在山中的時候，景仰他的人請敎他；他說，『我是學莊列的，對於目前的事情。害羞道之！』</p>
<p>莊、和列子都是因爲憤世而避世的；傳山這樣說、可見他對於外埃的不合作了。又有人問他，在宋朝的讀書人中誰最好：他的囘答是『吾取同甫。』因爲同甫是主張抗戰而收復失地的。</p>
<p>有個張際的遺民、也是因爲不肯同外族妥協，過度的以酒色自悮、漸的成了慢性的自殺，死後傳山去撫屍痛哭他：說他的死、和在戰場上陣亡的有同樣的意義。這固然是對於當時媚外者衆的憤慨語，也可見傳山是這樣王張　的，就是對於外族，至少要抱不台作主義！</p>
<h3 id="c61">越南同胞與中國難民 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 越南阮得順</p>
<p>中國抗日戰事展開以後，我們全越同胞無不留心每日局　的演變</p>
<p>那些殘酷的大炮聲與炸彈聲，不知殘害了多少衛國的勇士與無辜的民衆已使我們掬了不少同情淚！</p>
<p>我們一般學者或知識份子，是爲着那些歷史深長的名城與　跡——它是代表我們東方文明的精砷，現在一朝被摧毀於侵略者的炮火之下，而表示惋惜與憤恨不已—我們一般民衆，日常從報章和雜誌上，看見千千萬萬的無辜民衆，因侵略者轟炸無設防之城市及鄉村，以致血肉橫飛，遭受慘酷犧牲之消息及畫片，個個感受悲痛咨嗟，幷深恨侵略者之慘無人道—但有時我們聽到中國打勝仗。無論是大勝或小勝，大衆都感覺有無限的快樂。這種濃厚的情感，不是表面上的人爲的親善的表示，實在是基於人類固有的良心，同情於弱者不幸被强者所殘殺，也可說是爲　維護人類生存的正義，與公理的一種表示。</p>
<p>因爲有了這種可貴的同情心，所以，我們越地同胞對於援助中國的各種運動，佃個熱心，尤其是對於籌欵救済難民的工作，更加倍地努力。</p>
<p>這次從十二月一日至四日，我們越地同胞在河內Albert　Sarraut中學面前，一連舉行了四天游藝會。來籌欵救濟中國難民，大家都熱烈參加，旣可表示我們對中國難民的同情心，另一方面又能充分表示我們同胞不忘去年中國　遭受强　的侵略，國難危急之秋。還盡力來籌欵眼　我們大水災的恩息，必要報答鄰邦助我的好意！</p>
<p>我們常埋怨着那些主張和平的民主國家，爲什麽這　軟弱，忍心坐視、使殘暴的侵略者，得在　光天化日的世界，幹那刦掠焚殺的强盜式的暴行呢？我們只悵自已沒有轉變乾坤的力量，不然；我們是不容許這種殘賊人類的惡作劇存在的！</p>
<p>但我們目前所能做得到的，是每個同胞應　開自己的袋子，多捐一塊錢，多救活我們　邦的一個難民！這樣雖不能即刻地把大勢轉變過來，　我們算能盡人類有患難相救濟的義務於萬一　也可稍爲自慰。幷且也可以安慰那正在水深火熱中的中國民衆，証明類中只是少數殘暴者而已，還有大多數同情於他們，正在用盡方法來援助他們的。這是我們今後所應　續努力的途徑，還希望同胞們本着人類患難相救濟的精神，勇往直前，爲人這爲公理而奮鬥，打倒這爲世界上和平民衆的公敵—</p>

<p>— 僅總</p>
<p>是去年一個嚴寒的，冬天的早晨。</p>
<p>天氣冷得令人可怕，飛　似的雪花，在灰白幽暗的天空裏　　着，彷彿永不停制似的。片片的浮雲，時時旋轉　，似乎在找　躱避的地方。</p>
<p>大地上的一切，都沉　在嚴冬的氛園裏。除了凄厲的寒風，落葉的悲嗚，以及遠遠的，隆隆的　聲外，就聽不到別的聲息。</p>
<p>在這暗淡沉寂的天空下，巍巍的，連綿的山峯，環　着一幅廣大田國。滔滔的江水，永遠不息地物流其間。秀削尖峯，殘破的古寺，寬坦的山谷，肥沃的稻田，構成了一個鄉村的樂園，這就是我明媚故鄕的所在地——富　汀頭。</p>
<p>前綫的戰事，彷彿異常的緊張。降隆的大炮聲，在蕭條凄凉的情調裏，越來越近。重機關，手溜彈的聲昔，也淸晰　聞。×人的飛機，　飛　似的，成羣結隊的在這樂園上面盤旋着，恐怖的局面。似乎已到最嚴重的關頭了。壯丁隊，自衛團，</p>
<p>一隊隊的，踏着白雪。冒着寒氣，很莊嚴的向村外進發。他們每一個的臉上，都來現出他們所負的，偉大光榮的使命。</p>
<p>爸爸年紀雖老，還是熱烈地上了晨　綫。弟弟難然尙有穉氣，却不甘示弱，也興冲冲地跟着服務團出發了。「父是英雄兒好漢』，父與子兩代，都感到民埃的危亡，而爭赴國難了。</p>
<p>聽了爸爸的可囑，我不得不伴着年老的媽媽，捲起舖蓋，收拾細軟，離開了我曾經在那裏過了十七個寒暑的故鄉，僱了一隻小艇，向江上搖去。</p>
<p>艇上在滾滾的波流中向前進。礮聲，風聲，槳聲，合成了一種凄凉的交響，艇小人多我們時時感到一種起代不定的搖動。遙望家園，在×人飛機的盤柏下，彷彿低頭　息，在幾聲巨響之後，便着冒一片黑色的濃烟。接　我看見了一層熊熊的火光，彷彿還聽見幾聲低微的爆炸。我們馬上感到一陣緊張，憤恨的情緒，就更厲害的佔據了我們的心靈。</p>
<p>啊呵！櫛比竹籬　舍，，樸素的民房，疎落的　圃，濃密的果林，終十不免在××××××××了。</p>
<p>在滾滾的江繡中，小舟漸搖漸遠，故鄕的一切，終于在隆　的砲聲中，在黑色的濃煙裏，漸漸地渺小而消失了。</p>
<p>故鄉淪陷一年多。　說爸爸和弟弟，還在前方不斷地掙扎着，奮　着。願上帝祝福他們成功。我想終有一天，我可愛的，美麗的故鄕，會一樣明媚地，歡迎我們回去。</p>

<p>— 王劍鳴</p>
<p>不必諱言，我們戰時的文化工作，亦如政治一樣，還沒有能够　上軍事。老早提出的文章下鄉的口號，現在究竟已實行到怎樣的程度，誰也不敢說，甚至這個口號在今日也還未曾脫離討論的階段。我在這裏並不是對文化工作者有什麽吹求，面只是請他們把握住政治的新形勢，趕快由口號過渡到實踐。</p>
<p>同樣的，文章上前線也不是一個新的口號，然而根據沈鈞儒先生十日在本報發表的一篇文章，則「不談士兵，就是將領也往往一月半月看不到一張報紙』。于是戰士們不但和後方在精神上脫了節，而且對于他們自身所進行的戰事，也遠不如安處後方的我們那樣淸楚。抗戰的情勢到底怎樣了？他們不知道：政治的情勢到底怎樣了？他們不知道；國際的情勢到底怎樣了？他們更不知道。最直接的當事者，反而成爲事情的最隔膜者，難怪沈先生說「我們後方的人實布對不起前方將士。」</p>
<p>丟　良心不說，卽以加緊士兵政治敎育而言，也不能再讓這種現象繼續下去。我們能够全靠口頭進行士兵的政治敎育嗎？就算工作者不怕煩難，見效亦必十分遲緩，遠水救不了近火，戰事是不會讓你從容進行的。所以文字該應放在第一位，它能　着戰士跑，它能多方面地增長戰士的　識，它能多方面地解答戰士的問題，然而我們却偏偏缺乏這種最有力的武器。</p>
<p>其實這個口號的本身是無須討論的，要緊的是怎樣去實行。過去曾有輸送書報上前線的辦法，但是一事實上這還是空話，因爲那些書報事實上只能送到副官處，以及司令部等等地方爲　，决不能送到最前線的兵士手裏」。這是沈先生在前線親眼看到的事實。我們不能責怪副官處或司令部，不將書報再向最前線送，我們應該檢討主持輸送書報的工作，而加以改善，例如設立密接的轉運站等，不過專恃後方向前線輸送書報，到底是一件旣不够也靠不住的事，這只能作為戰士讀物的補充，而不能作為主力·第一演輪不變，第二　　不夠分配，第三內容雖能適合讀者的口味。所以最好的辦法，是文化工作者帶着筆上前線寫文章，就地印刷，利用無線電，利用簡單的印刷機，甚　油印機，這樣戰士可以讀到新鮮的東西，數量也可隨人數而增减，而作家與士兵生活在一起，也可用他們的言語，解答他們切身的問題，解答他們急應明白的問題。</p>
<p>過去已有很多文化人跑上前線，但是我們如要補救當前的缺點，開展未來的工作，一方面固然　望已在前線者對此加倍努力，一方面還得號召游離在後方的智識靑年大批擁上前線。自從失敗主義者被肅淸以後。我們的政治已更趨明朗，因之我們工作的阻碍也更爲減少，對于這樣良好的時機萬不　再有壹分鐘的浪費。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Striving for Even Greater Diplomatic Victories <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>"Striving for even greater diplomatic victories" is our major task in the second phase of the War of Resistance, and it is also a prerequisite for safeguarding peace in the Far East and world peace. We must do our utmost and fight heroically to perfectly accomplish this task.</p>
<p>What diplomatic victories have we achieved during the one and a half years of the War of Resistance? Why should we strive for even greater victories? And is it possible to strive for greater victories? What greater victories should we strive for, and how should we strive for them?</p>
<p>The one and a half years of the War of Resistance have created an unprecedentedly victorious situation in our country's diplomacy. On the negative side, we have gone from Wang Jingwei's policy of "negotiating while resisting" to "stopping diplomatic negotiations with the invading country"; from the stagnation of the Nanjing and Wanping negotiations to the complete cessation of all divisive and partial diplomatic actions; and from the repeated frustration of compromise conspiracies in diplomatic negotiations by Japanese and German ambassadors and pro-Japanese factions to the recent total retreat of the line of German and Italian surrenderism that emerged with Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the motherland. On the positive side, from the full-scale unfolding and persistence of the War of Resistance, we have achieved the unification, clarity, and strength of our diplomatic policy; and we have achieved the establishment and persistence of the diplomatic policy of "uniting all democratic and peace-loving countries to jointly oppose fascist aggressors." The comprehensive achievements of the above-mentioned negative and positive diplomacy, reflected in concrete victories, are: first, the great significance of China's War of Resistance against Japan in striving for the freedom of the Chinese nation and safeguarding world peace has gradually been understood, sympathized with, and supported by the vast majority of peace-loving and righteous people around the world; second, the cruelty and barbarity of Japan's war of aggression against China have been increasingly abhorred by people around the world due to the persistence of our War of Resistance and diplomatic policy; third, our demand for "aiding China and sanctioning Japan" has been unanimously passed by the League of Nations; fourth, the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and the Soviet Union's compliance with the League of Nations' resolution on aiding China have provided us with enthusiastic spiritual and material assistance; and fifth, the gradual change in the US government's Far East policy and the gradual activeness of the aid-China movement have influenced the gradual correction of the US government's policy of appeasement towards Japan and the gradual unfolding of the aid-China movement.</p>
<p>The past diplomatic successes indicate that the international situation, which is unfavorable to the Japanese and beneficial to us, has gradually developed. Is it possible for it to develop to be even more unfavorable to the Japanese and more beneficial to us? We believe that it is absolutely possible. First, it is absolutely impossible for the forces of Japanese fascist aggressors to reach a compromise with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, or any of these countries in China or the Far East; on the contrary, the development of Japanese power will inevitably further increase its conflicts with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. This is not only clearly recognized by the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but Japan itself cannot but admit it. According to a report from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the policy speech of the Hiranuma Cabinet, which is scheduled to be announced tomorrow (the 20th), will explain that its task is to strengthen the invasion of China and exclude British and American forces; Arita's diplomatic speech will further emphasize this point, that is, to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact and perfect the establishment of a "new order in East Asia of the Japan-Manchukuo-China bloc." Second, the persistence of our country's united resistance against Japan will inevitably further strengthen the belief of democratic and peace-loving countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in our country's final victory, and strengthen their determination to develop the aid-China and sanction-Japan movement. Third, the closer relations between the United Kingdom and France and between the United Kingdom and the United States, and the gradual convergence of the Far East policies of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, will inevitably give the Soviet Union greater convenience in actively assisting China. Fourth, the greater unity of fascist aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy will inevitably increase the degree of mutual reliance and cooperation among democratic and peace-loving countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, which is even more conducive to the formation and progress of the anti-fascist aggression front in the Pacific.</p>
<p>However, as of today, our country's diplomatic victories are still only victories within a certain limit. This kind of victory is not enough to solve the new difficulties that our country will encounter in the second phase of the War of Resistance; at the same time, although Japanese fascist aggressors have encountered unprecedented defeats in diplomacy and are in a state of "besieged on all sides," these failures and difficulties have not immediately reached the extent of forcing the Japanese rulers to completely abandon their fascist aggression policy. Even the Japanese rulers are going more madly towards the pinnacle of fascist aggression. In this process, their evildoing will be "aggravated"! Therefore, we must never be complacent with the initial victories of the past. On the one hand, we must increase the difficulties in the future of the Japanese aggressors, so that unless they completely abandon their fascist aggression policy, it will inevitably lead to the total collapse of the fascist aggression mechanism under the pressure of internal and external situations; on the other hand, we must strive for our greater victories, to achieve the close union of peace-loving and democratic countries to actively sanction fascist aggressors, and further establish a collective security system along the Pacific coast and even the entire world. To accomplish these two major tasks, we must recognize the following points:</p>
<p>First, resolutely supporting the nationwide united and protracted War of Resistance is the foundation for striving for even greater diplomatic victories; and enthusiastically supporting the government's correct national policy of "uniting with peace-loving and democratic countries to oppose fascist aggression" and resolutely opposing the so-called German-Italian line of surrenderers are the most fundamental conditions for striving for even greater diplomatic victories.</p>
<p>Second, striving for even greater diplomatic victories cannot be an isolated pro-Russian line or a Moscow line, nor can it be an isolated Anglo-American line or a London-Washington line, nor can it be a so-called League of Nations line or a Geneva line. We must recognize the Soviet Union's peace policy and its policy of assisting weak and oppressed nations. The Soviet Union is indeed a pillar of world peace, especially a loyal friend of the Chinese nation; but we should also recognize the increasingly obvious confrontation between the fascist aggression front and the democratic peace front in the world. We must unite all forces in the world that oppose fascist aggression into the camp of our friendly forces, so that our struggle will be less isolated, and our victory can be greater and more thorough.</p>
<p>Third, the League of Nations is still an organization for the peace front to launch sanctions against aggressors. Because of the inherent weaknesses and defects of this organization, we certainly cannot have any extravagant hopes. However, the current international situation is very favorable to our movement to aid China and sanction Japan. The League of Nations Executive Council is now beginning to discuss our country's proposals. We must mobilize public opinion and domestic and international mass movements, and enthusiastically support the appeals of our country's representatives. In the aid-China part, we demand that all countries further implement assistance to China in medicine, military supplies, military raw materials, and technical personnel; in the sanction-Japan part, we must first implement the cessation of the export of military supplies and military raw materials such as airplanes and kerosene to Japan, and the boycott of Japanese export goods.</p>
<p>In addition, we must do everything possible to launch and develop a united front of peace-loving and righteous people around the world against fascist aggression, first and foremost the unified organization of anti-fascist and anti-aggression groups worldwide and in various countries. We must also do everything possible to launch and develop a united front against fascism within the fascist aggressors' own countries and among the people in their occupied territories. Only a broad anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement, closely coordinated with the strength of our national unity and protracted War of Resistance, can increase the difficulties of the Japanese invaders and complete our greater and final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Rebirth of the Chinese Nation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Soong Mei-ling Chiang</p>
<p>In front of the south entrance of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, there is a peculiar stone tablet with a Latin word engraved on it: "Resurgam." It means: "I will rise again." The origin of this stone tablet is as follows: When the dome of the church was about to be completed, the architect, Sir Christopher Wren, needed a stone to mark the center point of the building for the workers to identify. Among a pile of waste materials, he accidentally picked up an old tombstone with this Latin word engraved on it. Its meaning greatly moved the architect, so he decided to build this stone tablet on the surface and preserve it forever. This stone tablet is still there today, and anyone who sees it will spontaneously feel optimistic. This inscription, such a simple and powerful word, is especially moving for us, who are witnessing the deaths and injuries of our compatriots and the destruction of our homes and country. It will be deeply imprinted in the hearts of each of us and shine brightly on our banners!</p>
<p>When we open the map of China, it is easy to understand how the Japanese, relying on their superior naval, land, and air forces, have invaded more than a dozen provinces in our eastern region. So far, they have plundered many of our railway, highway, and waterway transportation lines, and have cruelly massacred countless of our compatriots, destroying their homes, their businesses, and their orchards; forcing many people to travel long distances to find a livelihood, to find a safe place to avoid bombing and slaughter.</p>
<p>The provinces in the east that have suffered the most from the Japanese invasion are our richest agricultural and cultural areas.</p>
<p>Until recently, everyone thought that the western provinces were remote and difficult to reach without enduring arduous travel and long journeys. Most of the compatriots living in the east regarded the western provinces as sacred places producing exotic flowers, rare animals, and precious metals. Everyone knew that there were towering mountains and primitive indigenous people living there, and that these mountains were the source of several major rivers in our country, but the compatriots in the east felt that it was really too difficult to approach.</p>
<p>Before the fall of Nanjing, the people across the country paid little attention to these remote provinces in the west, but now tens of thousands of people—some of whom are leaders in the industry, some of whom are celebrities in the academic field—are leading their colleagues and students to migrate in from ships, cars, or on foot. The result of this mass migration will accelerate the long-delayed construction of Sichuan and other western provinces. In this way, what might normally take fifty years to complete can be achieved in one year.</p>
<p>Our gains here will exceed the compensation for our losses. We will quickly and firmly build a revitalized country on the established foundation—a brand new, strong, and powerful Republic of China.</p>
<p>The pioneers who went to the western United States in the past were attracted by the ore and fertile soil there, but they went to an undeveloped virgin land. Although our west is so vast and has always been so difficult to penetrate, culture has already been established there, and dense populations live there. The reason why people have not been able to develop natural resources is because of its complicated routes and steep mountains. Except for a few places along the Yangtze River or larger tributaries where there are boats and civilian ships, the only means of transportation there rely on the slow and laborious walking of coolies or mules and horses. The difference between our west and the west of the United States at that time is that our west does not lack manpower, but only lacks technology and transportation. In other words, it only lacks the driving force to promote development. Now this large-scale migration has brought many engineers and experts to the western provinces. Air transport, such as the highways connecting the provinces, and the highways leading to Burma via Yunnan and to Europe via Xinjiang, has greatly reduced the difficulty of communication. Railways are also advancing, and at a certain time, they can communicate with neighboring Western countries.</p>
<p>Some people—especially the Japanese who are invading our country—believe that the day of the complete disappearance of our country's independence and our country's autonomy has come. Others believe that it is only a matter of time before we put the yoke of slavery on our necks.</p>
<p>These people, whether they are pessimistic or optimistic, always overlook an important historical revelation. China has become a nation and a country because it retains a power of rebirth, so it can overcome the natural and man-made disasters of the centuries and still stand between heaven and earth, unshakable.</p>
<p>This power of rebirth is indestructible. All of our contemporaries can see that we still possess this profound power, just as we have endured thousands of years of trials and tribulations to protect the long heritage of our ancestors and have waged long-term struggles. Our history is full of events that show this great power. We must cultivate this power, use this power, and we will never let our generation or future generations be stained with the shame of sacrificing the right to national survival. Our compatriots will continue to struggle, continue to survive, and we will revive and prosper our nation, even in the nominally occupied guerrilla areas, under extremely difficult circumstances. In those areas, the Japanese mistakenly believe that they have grasped everything, but in reality, it is just a fleeting dream. This fragile grasp will become less and less reliable over time, and as a result, under the oppression of the heroic struggle of our Chinese nation, they will definitely have to give up!</p>
<p>In the west, we will use our innate courage, heroic spirit, and enduring strength to build a new China—a new country forged from the crucible of war. I believe she has the wisdom to adapt to changes, and she is progressive, indomitable, and fearless.</p>
<p>Friendly countries who sympathize with us, and the Japanese who are destroying our country, if they have enough imagination to comprehensively consider the characteristics of our indomitable resistance over the past eighteen months, then they will definitely see that meaningful Latin word, and it will forever shine brightly in the west of our Republic of China, on the walls of our great Great Wall, and on the coastal cliffs of our coastal provinces. In that dazzling color, intertwined with the blue blood shed by the martyrs and the flames burning on the earth, the wise eyes of our souls will surely clearly see that immortal and prophetic Latin word: "I will rise again." This simple and powerful word concretely embodies the spirit of our Chinese nation.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Review of the Domestic and International Situation in Japan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday's second paragraph)</p>
<p>What troubles the Japanese the most is the Soviet Union. Japan also recognizes the Soviet Union as their enemy. During the cabinet reshuffle, the military was also worried about the Soviet Union, revealing a phenomenon of terror. As for the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan, we can clearly see that the recent Soviet refusal to negotiate with Japan on "fisheries" has shown that the Soviet Union is already implementing sanctions against Japan. As for the national mobilization plan, this is entirely because the warlords want to seize financial power from the hands of the zaibatsu and make free requisitions. Therefore, the zaibatsu are dissatisfied with the warlords. In Itagaki's fifth condition, wanting to increase national production, we can investigate that Japan's export trade and domestic industry have suffered extremely great losses since the war began. In March and April of last year, we received reports regarding the blows suffered by the Japanese textile industry. There were six million spindles at home and abroad. Since the War of Resistance, 750,000 spindles have been destroyed in Qingdao and 300,000 spindles in Shanghai, totaling 3.5 million spindles. The losses are even greater now, and it is already declining due to the war.</p>
<p>The sixth requirement is to enhance national spirit. However, since the War of Resistance, there has been war-weariness among the people and anti-war sentiment among the soldiers. How can their war be expanded? A recent incident can prove that there is no oil in Japan. However, mechanized units need gasoline. Therefore, they can only rely on foreigners. Their treasury is empty. To buy gasoline, they have no cash. Therefore, they changed to using liquid fuel. That fuel is replaced by alcohol and petroleum, so they have to plant more sweet potatoes, and forcibly purchase them from farmers at two cents and three cents. However, farmers need three cents to produce sweet potatoes, so not only can they not make money, but they lose money. The government is always blindly coercive. Last year, there were already four riots in their country. These are all evidence of war-weariness, anti-war sentiment, and the inability to produce in Japan.</p>
<p>Looking at the Japanese situation in our country, on December 24 of last year, in Jinghai on the Jinpu Railway, the Japanese there often suffer from insomnia. Once, ten Japanese soldiers carried a machine gun and five rifles and surrendered to us. Although the number of people is small, it is enough to show that the Japanese soldiers are also tired of war on the battlefield. Recently, a team of Japanese soldiers near Hankou was disarmed by the Japanese gendarmerie for launching anti-war propaganda. Itagaki's seventh requirement to increase foreign trade is that since Japan launched its war of aggression, Japan's foreign trade has only been declining. Therefore, his seven requirements, as long as we study them slightly, are self-contradictory and have no way out. Therefore, they can only increase the difficulties in Japan and promote the decline of national spirit. The revolutionary trend in the country is also bound to happen.</p>
<p>Speaking of our China, since our Supreme Leader Generalissimo Chiang led the soldiers and civilians of the whole country and launched the War of Resistance, the national policy has always been consistent. Our national policy will not change in three, five, or ten years. Now that the War of Resistance has reached the second stage, military preparations have long been arranged. Our land is vast and our people are numerous. We are now strengthening the organization of the people in the guerrilla areas, strengthening the guerrilla forces, and building the core of the guerrilla areas. We are turning the rear of the Japanese into our front lines. Without exaggeration, a guerrilla core can control the strength of at least three Japanese divisions. If we have ten guerrilla areas, we can control thirty Japanese divisions. The more guerrilla cores there are, the more the Japanese will be absolutely unable to move. General Peng Dehuai once talked about the guerrilla warfare in Wutai Mountain, Shanxi. The Japanese army used the strength of three divisions to try to wipe out our guerrillas. As a result, we became stronger and stronger. They were killed a brigade commander and a regimental commander. Moreover, there is also an anecdote, that is, the Japanese army in our guerrilla war zone relies on air transport for their food supply. Therefore, our guerrillas disguised themselves as Japanese soldiers, and as a result, the food was all obtained by us. Recently, the battle situation on the front line can be said to be more intense than at the beginning of the War of Resistance. For example, after the fall of Wuhan, the Japanese army only occupied Yuezhou and was unable to invade Changsha. After occupying De'an, it was unable to invade Nanchang. This proves the strength of the fighting power of the soldiers on the front line. Therefore, in the future military affairs of our second phase of the War of Resistance, we are more confident.</p>
<p>China's industry originally focused on the areas along the river and along the coast, but now it has been completely moved to the inland. Now we are trying our best to enrich production, and the transportation in the rear has also completed a lot without our knowledge. This proves that our government is doing its best to develop construction. When I was in Guilin, I met an old man who proudly said: We Guangxi people could not build railways, but now we can also build railways. Therefore, in the year and a half of the War of Resistance, we seem to have suffered losses in appearance, but internally we have gained infinite and great victories. It is absolutely impossible for the Japanese to use methods to deal with China. We have pushed the Japanese from a first-class country to the final stage. Next, the Japanese must "XXXX" (End)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 17th] The authorities today sent a letter to the military and police strictly prohibiting traitors from spreading rumors. Those caught will be treated as collaborators.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, Approximate Air Travel Time] Sichuan Province is the hinterland of the Southwest, thousands of miles away from the front lines. Furthermore, as an undefended city, for over a year, we had not heard the sound of guns or cannons, leading us to believe that the Southwest rear would not suffer the scourge of the enemy. Unexpectedly, disaster has arrived at our doorstep. After noon on the 15th, the wailing air raid sirens began to blare in Chongqing. Soon after, the urgent sirens followed one after another. Citizens, as if by agreement, sought shelter in safe areas, each searching for cover. In the midst of this, twenty-seven enemy planes arrived over Chongqing. The sound of machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and bombs dropped by the enemy planes enveloped the entire city. A full hour passed before the all-clear siren finally sounded.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Bombed Disaster Area</p>
<p>At the moment when the all-clear siren had not yet sounded, people surged from the fields below like a tide, then desperately climbed towards the mountains opposite. The reporter was mixed in with the crowd at the time and also climbed up a bare hill. Looking at the side of the hill, there were a few black smoke-filled chimneys still intact, but the houses around them were as riddled as a honeycomb. Especially those few small houses that suffered the worst, their walls and tiles had all turned into mud powder.</p>
<p>After the all-clear siren sounded, the reporter rushed down from the hill in one breath to the scene of the disaster. At the edge of the nearby field, people were trembling, sighing, and cursing around a severed arm that had flown over. From the delicate flesh on the arm and the blackened palm with traces of coal, it could be determined that the deceased was still a young worker, but his useful life was so brutally taken away by the enemy.</p>
<p>It seemed that one family had suffered the most tragically. Inside the house—it looked like a collapsed building—seven or eight victims lay horizontally and vertically. The head of one female corpse was missing, and the leather coat on her body, along with a piece in front of her, was gone, blown away to who knows where. Two members of the civil defense force were guarding a foot-long infant, providing emergency treatment to passersby. Pitifully, the innocent little life was like a clay doll, lying stiffly. A thin slit was slightly open between its eyes, and its teeth and nostrils were all filled with soil. There was a dried blood clot on the top of its head. Such a weak and helpless little infant should have been in the warm and soft embrace of its mother, sucking its mother's milk and spending its childhood in comfort—but our wicked enemy had taken its life in this way.</p>
<p>In just a few minutes of inspection, we discovered that there were as many as eight children who had died in one or two houses. Their innocent and pure faces had all become like pumpkins, pale and swollen, covered with dry dirt, as if they had just been dug out of the ground.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to leave this bombed area to inspect elsewhere, two seven- or eight-year-old children, their faces covered in tears, walked hand in hand towards the bombed-out house, shouting "Mama, Mama!" I couldn't bear to listen anymore. My heart sank within me. I only hoped that the woman whose head had been blown off was not their mother.</p>
<p>Regarding the Aftermath</p>
<p>After inspecting the disaster area, in order to understand the exact number of civilian deaths and injuries and the authorities' measures after the tragic bombing, the reporter made a special visit to Xu Zhongqi, Director of the Chongqing Police Bureau and Commander of the Civil Defense Corps. He told the reporter: The exact number of deaths cannot be accurately determined at the moment, but it is generally around two to three hundred. As for the people killed and injured and the members of the Civil Defense Corps who died in the line of duty, it has been decided to request superior authorities to provide generous compensation and pensions. Meanwhile, the situation has been reported orally to the central authorities. The authorities are also very concerned about the evacuation of the city's population and have issued instructions. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices in the future, the evacuation of Chongqing's population will be intensified from today. It is hoped that the families of civil servants in various agencies will evacuate voluntarily. As for other citizens in the city without fixed occupations, those who do not need to stay in Chongqing will be instructed to evacuate as soon as possible by the sub-bureaus. If necessary, compulsory evacuation will be enforced, and they will be ordered to move out of the city. It is hoped that the general public will both preserve the nation's vitality and value their own lives and property, reducing unnecessary harm and sacrifice.</p>
<p>In addition, the Air Defense Department also attaches great importance to the work of providing compensation and relief to the civilians who were killed and injured in this incident. It is reported that the department will immediately join relevant agencies to organize an air raid casualty relief committee so that citizens from various places under its jurisdiction who are injured and killed and sent to Chongqing can be provided relief in a coordinated manner by the committee. Secondly, in order to evacuate and provide relief to civilians who have lost their homes in the air raids, the department will immediately convene municipal government and other agencies in the city to discuss finding vacant land to build temporary shelters that can accommodate tens of thousands of people, and the relief association has also agreed to allocate funds for subsidies.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Suspension of Overdrafts and Debt Repayments: No Impact on Foreign Exchange; Stabilizes Exchange Rates <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] According to well-informed sources, the central government's announcement a few days ago of suspending the payment of interest on foreign debts secured by customs tariffs has had no impact on China's exchange rates. Although the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender has declined since last spring, Shanghai and other inland refugees do not have large amounts of silver coins to exchange for foreign currency. Now that the government is implementing the suspension of interest payments on foreign debts, it is actually protecting China's original foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, it is said that the result of this measure will be to stabilize the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender in the long term.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Dr. Zhang Pengchun, a professor at Nankai University, flew to London from Chongqing. He stayed in Yangon for three days and met with people in academic circles.

China will field 240 divisions, each with 10,000 soldiers. At that time, there will be no so-called positional warfare, nor will there be any so-called front lines, but a new kind of full-scale mobile warfare. Military expansion will extend to all parts of the country. He believes that Japan does not have sufficient troops to offer effective resistance. Furthermore, China's international assistance is gradually materializing according to the expected timeline, that is, 18 months after the start of the war." He concluded by saying, "China's plan is not only to expel the Japanese, but also to build a new nation."</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Situation in the Northwest and River Defense <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Bai Yun</p>
<p>4. Will the Enemy's New Offensive Begin in the Northwest?</p>
<p>Our national defense lines are now in the Southwest and Northwest, both of which have vital connections to our international transportation and are places we can no longer afford to lose. The Northwest has a vast area and an extremely long front line. From the Yellow River defense line passing through western Shanxi and eastern Suiyuan, all the way to western Henan and northwestern Hubei, these are all the outer areas of the Northwest. The enemy cannot begin by attacking Xi'an and Lanzhou; they must first do some preparatory work, that is, first be able to control this very long outer line or some important parts of this outer line. So, from where will they begin their offensive? Or will they launch an offensive along the entire line at the same time? We believe that the enemy does not have the strength to launch an offensive along the entire line at the same time. They must place their main force on the more important side, while simultaneously launching feints on other sides. In this way, their main force must be placed in southern Henan and the central section of the Longhai Railway, aiming at Xi'an and invading westward. At the same time, a portion of their forces will launch feints from areas around Xiangfan, Nanyang, Wuyuan, Linhe, Liulin, and Yumen, attacking various places in western Henan, southern Shaanxi, Ningxia, and northern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, the enemy must do a lot of difficult preparatory work: First, Xiangfan, Nanyang, Wuyuan, and other places cannot be obtained easily. Second, in order to facilitate their westward military operations, they must first clear the Pinghan Railway and control the central section of the Longhai Railway centered on Zhengzhou, attacking Luoyang and Shanzhou. However, there are the dangers of Hulao Pass and Hangu Pass between Zhengzhou and Tongguan. Along the line, we have demolished the city walls and built fortifications in various counties, and the terrain in western Henan is treacherous, and the people are strong and brave. The enemy's westward invasion will consume considerable time and effort. Third, there is the great danger of the Yellow River between Shanxi and Shaanxi. Hundreds of thousands of our troops are scattered throughout Shanxi. It is by no means an easy task for the enemy to rely solely on crossing the river to invade Shaanxi. Therefore, they must first advance westward along the Longhai Railway with their main force and cross the river from western Shanxi to assist in the advance. However, to achieve this goal, they must use an extremely large force in the Shanxi border area. The first loss is to attack northwestern and northeastern Shanxi in order to ensure Datong, the most important rear transportation hub. Secondly, it is necessary to attack the guerrilla teams on both sides of the Datong-Puzhou Railway and the Zhengtai Railway in order to ensure the transportation lines in the east, south, west, and north. Finally, it is also necessary to attack our military bases in central, southeastern, southwestern, and southern Shanxi, block all the river crossings, cut off our connections with the rear, and place the entire Shanxi under their control before they dare to cross the river, in order to coordinate their westward military operations along the Longhai Railway. However, to complete this task, a very long time and a great deal of military strength must be expended; otherwise, it cannot be done. Some people say that the enemy wants to attack northern Shaanxi; some people say that the enemy wants to attack Ningxia first; and others say that the enemy wants to attack Ningxia and Hanzhong at the same time in order to reach Lanzhou and encircle Xi'an. This is a dangerous route that deviates from the railway line and goes deep into the interior, and almost most of it is mountainous terrain, where the enemy's large armies cannot deploy and heavy weapons are not easy to use. Its difficulty is even greater than invading west along the Longhai Railway. Moreover, the enemy does not have sufficient troops to use. Therefore, we believe that the possibility of the enemy attacking the Northwest is to invade Xi'an westward along the Longhai Railway. Naturally, after the enemy has been defeated in its westward advance along the Longhai Railway, it is also possible that it will take advantage of the weakness to attack our relatively weak areas (such as Ningxia). We cannot rigidly determine the enemy's overall offensive strategy.</p>
<p>Here, we want to bring up the issue of intelligence work. With accurate intelligence, we can make accurate judgments about the enemy's situation. With accurate judgments about the enemy's situation, we can win. We must pay attention to the source of intelligence and the ability of intelligence officers. For each piece of intelligence, we must make an accurate judgment based on the various circumstances of the enemy, ourselves, and the international situation at the time. Never treat rumors as intelligence, and never consider every piece of intelligence to be correct without thinking. In this way, it will greatly harm military affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Recently, Our Forces Annihilated Over 20,000 Enemy Troops in Guangdong and Shanxi Provinces; the Imminent Approach of a Major Battle Places Us in an Advantageous Position; an Official Discusses the Battle Situation on Various Fronts <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 18th] A certain official stated that there are currently no major battles on any front. The engagements in Shanxi and Guangdong are also localized. Currently, our forces are actively deploying in preparation for the decisive battle of the second phase. Our international environment is improving daily, our political economy is consolidated, and our spiritual and material strength surpasses that of the past. Furthermore, the Supreme Leader is in good health and spirit, which is especially fortunate for the nation and the people. Should the battle commence, we will undoubtedly occupy a superior position. The enemy is currently adopting a defensive posture on all fronts, with frequent movements and unclear intentions. In the recent two to three weeks of fierce fighting in Guangdong and Shanxi, our forces annihilated over 20,000 enemy troops. A certain unit of ours has been sweeping up small groups of enemy puppet troops in Chahar in recent days, achieving considerable success. In Shandong Province, our replacement troops have arrived, and the enemy has concentrated at transportation hubs,不敢活動。 Recently, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, the Jiaozhou-Jinan Railway, and the Datong-Puzhou Railway have been intermittently disrupted, which proves that our guerrilla forces in the north are indeed stronger.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, Geneva, 18th] Yesterday afternoon, during the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Dr. Gu Weijun, leader of the Chinese delegation, delivered a powerful speech for over an hour, requesting the Assembly to assist China. His conditions are as follows: (1) Financial and economic sanctions against Japan; (2) League of Nations member states should implement a boycott of Japanese goods; (3) Prohibition of the import of raw materials for military supplies into Japan; (4) Strict prohibition of the transport of aircraft and kerosene to Japan; (5) League of Nations member states should effectively assist China through economic means; (6) Simplify the procedures for transporting military supplies to China; (7) All League of Nations member states with interests in the Far East should jointly organize a special committee to review methods of resisting Japan and preventing Japan from continuing its war against China. Mr. Gu also stated that assisting China in resisting aggression is actually for the sake of the interests of all nations, as a free China will certainly make great contributions to world commerce. He also said that in recent weeks, Chinese forces have won consecutive victories, and their strength is increasing in the resistance in the western provinces. Furthermore, the guerrilla tactics of the Chinese forces will intercept the Japanese forces and prevent them from being deployed. He is confident that Hangzhou will be recovered in the near future. Furthermore, in the provinces nominally occupied by the Japanese forces, 93% of the land is still under the administration of the Chinese forces today. In South China, since January, Chinese forces have planned to recover Guangzhou. Currently, all the actual situations can prove that Chinese forces still have the strength to deal with everything. As for the peace conditions proposed by Prime Minister Konoe the other day, if China agrees to accept them, the entire Asia will be under the control of Japanese warlords in the future. Konoe's advocacy of the "Manchukuo" Greater Group is an attempt to forcibly place the Far East under Japanese rule. China's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, in other words, China's diplomacy will be controlled by the Japanese, and China would become a "Shina." He also stated that China's not participating in the Anti-Comintern Pact does not mean that it is adopting communism or implementing communist policies, as the Chinese government has long made a decision, and domestic and foreign policies have been clearly defined. He also stated that the Open Door Policy can only be maintained after China has freedom and independence. He also stated that if Japan wins, Japanese culture will be forcibly implemented in China, but Japanese culture is far inferior to Chinese culture, as is known to the world. Finally, Mr. Gu stated that President Roosevelt's speech on the 4th of this month said that if Japanese forces win, foreign commercial relations in the Far East will be over. Therefore, he hopes that all nations will consider this. It is heard that China's proposal will be debated at today's Assembly.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 18th] The Times published a commentary today, stating, "Dr. Gu Weijun's repeated appeals to the League of Nations are of doubtful effectiveness, as they can only deepen the political weakness of the League of Nations on the whole. The majority of member states of the League of Nations have formally stated that although they have obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, its meaning should be revised. They did not say that the obligations under that article should be voluntary and depend on the circumstances of each case. For example, the financial and economic assistance to China listed by Dr. Gu can be effective.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Geneva, 18th] The League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss China's request for sanctions against Japan. The Chinese representative, Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun, delivered a speech.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Geneva, 17th] Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun, in today's General Assembly of the League of Nations Administrative Council, requested the League of Nations to prohibit the transport of aircraft and gasoline to Japan, stating, "This prohibition is sufficient to stop Japan's work of destroying China. "China respects the Open Door, while Japan wants to dominate it alone." Mr. Gu also elaborated on the Chinese guerrillas' activity strategy behind Japanese lines and its success. Mr. Gu also stated, "The main purpose of the establishment of the League of Nations is to seek international peace and security, so it can be called a peace institution. Although there have been various failures in the past, the Chinese government still believes that it is sufficient to promote peace, and member states, especially the most responsible member states, are still fully prepared to assist in its efforts. The real tool to prevent war does not have to be war itself. President Roosevelt said, 'Besides war, there are other ways to sanction aggressors. What are these methods? That is, to exclude the goods of the aggressor country.' In the current situation, prohibiting the import of Japanese goods by direct or indirect methods can defeat Japan's economic foundation in the shortest time. Eighty percent of Japan's silk production is imported into one country, and four out of five of its textiles are usually sold to three or four countries." Dr. Gu said that this kind of boycott movement has been automatically implemented by the people of many countries, so it is not difficult for the government to implement it. The Administrative Council should make a decision on the matter of prohibiting the export of aircraft and gasoline to Japan, and then transfer it to member states for implementation. The Chinese government hopes that the Administrative Council can make recommendations to member states to provide China with financial and economic assistance to develop and build the southwestern provinces of China and to provide relief to refugees. Furthermore, military supplies provided to China by various countries must also enjoy transportation convenience, so that it can continue to resist the aggression of Japan with effort. In the past eighteen months, the Chinese government has experienced many difficulties in seeking this kind of transportation convenience, and the impact on China's resistance has been significant. The Chinese government now requests the Administrative Council to take special steps to establish a "Coordination Committee." However, if it feels that it is difficult to implement a "full" committee at present, the Chinese government is willing for the Administrative Council to establish a small-scale "Coordination Committee" composed of representatives of countries that pay special attention to the situation in the Far East. Furthermore, the actions taken by various countries to assist China in resisting the war should not be regarded as beneficial only to China, but also to the maintenance of international law and international order, and various countries will benefit. Moreover, all countries with direct rights and interests in the Far East have this legitimate guarantee, which is also sufficient to ensure their own security. According to past experience, if the Chinese people cannot be masters of their own destiny, then it is obviously impossible to maintain the interests of Western countries in China. If we want to continue to maintain the Open Door in China, we must give the Chinese people full power to manage their families. The League of Nations should have taken effective action to stop Japan's aggression long ago. Unfortunately, this opportunity has already passed, and it has been delayed for too long. All countries that own important territorial rights and economic commercial rights in the Far East have a more serious obligation to protect these rights. In the past eighteen months, Japan has abused these rights and expanded the scope of its aggression. All countries should be clear about what they will encounter in the future. If the countries concerned do not intend to abandon their treaty rights and vested interests in China, and in fact, they are not so prepared, then they should not miss the opportunity and should act together to stop the spread of Japan's aggressive ambitions. If all countries can take resolute and agile action, they will certainly gain without loss." According to various predictions, before the adjournment of the General Assembly, another closed meeting will be held to discuss the Chinese government's request.</p>
<p>Representative Gu Issues Statement; Japan Violates the Spirit of Trusteeship</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Geneva, 17th] After the League of Nations Mandates Commission submitted a report on the islands under Japanese mandate, Dr. Gu Weijun specially issued a statement stating that according to the "Japanese Mobilization Law" of May 1938, overall mobilization has been implemented on the islands, which is inconsistent with the spirit of the mandated area. Therefore, he has the right to submit this matter to the League of Nations Administrative Council, having obtained a great deal of information on it. Montesu, the reporter of the committee, said that if information is submitted to the Mandated Areas Committee, the committee should express its opinion.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Geneva, 18th] The League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting yesterday to discuss the report of the Mandates Commission. The British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Batra, delivered a brief speech on the Palestine issue, first stating the report of the Palestine issue investigation team and the Palestine issue meeting to be held in London, and suggested that if the meeting obtains a specific decision, then the Mandates Committee should then hold a meeting to consider what amendments should be proposed, so that the Administrative Council will have a basis when it holds a meeting on the 5th, without delay. At that time, the convener of the Mandates Committee, Latvian Foreign Minister Montes, stood up and replied, accepting Batra's suggestion.</p>
<h3 id="e18">US Senator Proposes to Stop Buying Silver; Frank Farther Appointed Judge; Senate Passed It the Other Day <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 17th] Today, US Senator Winson proposed a bill advocating the immediate cancellation of the authorities' power to purchase silver and issue silver certificates. The purpose is to maintain the domestic market so that it can purchase the existing silver in the country. The bill proposes to prohibit all silver imports. The Ministry of Finance, in addition to reserving 5.5 million ounces of new silver for future minting, will freely dispose of all silver.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, New York, 17th] A correspondent from the Dow Jones Report in Washington stated that several US senators discussed methods to reduce the surplus production of cotton at a cotton conference, but failed to obtain a definite plan. Senator Smith stated that although many bills were proposed at the meeting, none have yet gained majority approval.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 17th] The US Senate today passed the appointment of Frank Farther as a judge of the country's Supreme Court. Mr. Farther is a Jewish professor at Harvard University Law School and is known for his support of liberal intellectual teachings. He is also very sympathetic to President Roosevelt's New Deal.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Bombings in Various Parts of England; Conspiracy of the Irish Republican Army; English Police Have Been Mobilized for Alert <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 10th] According to the results of inspections by officials across the island, the series of mysterious bombings that occurred in London, Manchester, and elsewhere on Sunday have a definite odor of conspiracy. There were three explosions in Manchester, with only one death. Other than that, there were only material losses. After the police officers were quickly transferred, their deduction was the same as that of the official side, that is, these bombings were initiated by those sympathetic to the illegal "Irish Republican Army." The police officers believe that the plan was conceived in Ireland beforehand, and then the bombs made there were transported to England. It is also worth noting that all previous conspiracies have targeted power plants. That is, an unexploded bomb was found in the Hamshire power plant in Birmingam yesterday. The bomb was placed under a main generator. If it had unfortunately exploded, it would have plunged the entire city of Birmingam into darkness. According to power department personnel, they did not know that a bomb existed at first. When they received a report saying that this kind of conspiracy had occurred in other parts of the country, they carefully inspected various parts of the factory before discovering the bomb. They are now waiting for experts from the Ministry of Interior and the police to come and inspect it. In addition to the mine factories, all gas factories and public buildings across the country are also being protected by personnel. Local broadcasting stations in the Midlands and reporting stations in Du Laozizi Weiqu have also had guards sent to them.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 17th] A fifteen-year-old schoolboy found a broken briefcase near Liverpool today, containing a small alarm clock. The public believes that what he found was a remnant of a bomb accessory. Near the briefcase, there was also a dilapidated bridge tower (used to support electrical wires). The main lightning line from Liverpool and Manchester to Burriston passes through this tower. London's "White Hall" was placed on alert today. Both sides of Downing Street are patrolled by police, and pedestrians coming from "White Hall" are subject to strict inspection.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, London, 18th] Yesterday afternoon, the walls of Liverpool were suddenly covered with slogans of the Irish Republican Army, demanding the establishment of a unified Irish Republic. The police immediately mobilized, tore off the slogans, and searched the areas where the Irish live. The city's power plants and public buildings have been heavily guarded.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, London, 18th] The detectives here have been fully mobilized since yesterday morning to protect power plants, gas companies, and water companies, so as to threaten the force. The sleeve and other secondary power stations are also guarded by police. Since Tuesday, the Thames River has also been patrolled by ice police, and police vehicles patrol London to maintain alert. Although the police have stepped up investigations into the bombing case, there have been no results. It is believed that because of the intensified police protection, the troublemakers will be active at night in the future. The bombing case in Birmingam on Monday remains unsolved. The police force in Manchester, Birmingam, and Edinburgh has been increased three times. The power plant in Park Berello in the west of Edinburgh is under even tighter guard, because the two power sources supply Scotland with heavy power. One of the two, which cost 2 million to build, was recently completed.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Italy Increases Troops in Libya; If Action is Taken Against France; Germany Declares it Will Provide Support <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tunis Port, 17th] According to natives of Italian Libya who fled to this place, from the end of November of last year to the beginning of this month, approximately 20,000 officers and soldiers from the Italian mainland army and native troops have successively arrived in the Libyan colony. After landing in the Port of Suara, they have already set off for the Tunisian border. In addition, the Italian military authorities are also building aircraft hangars in western Libya, near the border with Algeria, as a base for attacking Tunisia.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Berlin, 17th] According to authoritative sources, if Mussolini believes that the Spanish non-intervention agreement has been broken by a third country and takes any action, Germany will provide support. It is also said that the interference of France in Spain is a factor that promotes extreme unrest. Some people in France are trying to promote the government to aid the Spanish government. Italy's tough attitude towards this is also supported by people here.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Rome, 18th] Because the French newspapers continue to attack Italy and are considered an insult to the army, the Italian side has been returning the medals previously awarded to Italian military generals by the French government since yesterday to retaliate against the French newspapers. Furthermore, many morning newspapers here yesterday warned France to immediately stop insulting Italian soldiers. If the French newspapers continue their anti-Italian movement, war will be inevitable. A certain newspaper replied to the comments of French newspapers, stating that Italian sailors will only leave their country to serve on the battlefield when absolutely necessary. The remarks of the French newspapers are the biggest obstacle to the realization of world peace. It now seems that the time is approaching when it is absolutely necessary. If the French continue to provoke, the Italian people will find a way to retaliate.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Burgos, today] Spanish rebel troops are currently attacking Barcelona along the highway and have successively captured four city strongholds. They are now only twelve miles away from Igualada, the major industrial center of Spain. The government forces hold heavy troops there. The rebel troops are also approaching Igualada from the southwest, only ten miles away from the city. It is heard that the rebel troops have also captured 1,100 government soldiers and a large number of military supplies. Since the start of the offensive, the rebel troops have captured a total of 38,000 people, all of whom have been placed in concentration camps. According to the rebel troops' supreme command, the offensive on all fronts continues to make progress.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Rome, 17th] According to the Roman Civil Report, the main purpose of the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Storadovic in Becici was to conclude a South Hungarian agreement. The main points of this new agreement are that Hungary respects the existing borders of South Romania, and South Romania guarantees fair treatment for the Hungarian minority in the country. Another purpose of the talks was to make Romania also join the agreement. In addition, it also wanted to form a connection between Italy, Hungary, and Romania to seek special economic benefits. This kind of combination will be in close alignment with the Berlin-Rome Axis, which goes without saying. Gaida, a spokesman for Mussolini, wrote in an Italian newspaper, "Changes are brewing along the Vistula and the Baltic." He reviewed the steps taken by Yugoslavia to gradually approach the Berlin-Rome Axis and said that it is in Romania's own interest to guide its policies in the same direction in the future.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] According to the Paris correspondent of the "Times," the French government has sent a note to Japan, similar in nature to the recent notes sent to Japan by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(Tokyo, 17th) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting of key department heads on the 16th to review the British note to Japan. Furthermore, after a cabinet meeting this morning, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai jointly discussed how to respond to the British note and the American protest. The result was a decision to respond to Britain in writing. At the same time, Foreign Minister Arita will respond orally to U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew. It is said that Japan has no sincerity in this matter and intends to deal with Britain and the United States with evasive arguments.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] It is reported that the Japanese government is willing to discuss the principle of the Open Door Policy in China with Britain and the United States. However, U.S. State Department personnel are unwilling to comment on this, saying that this Japanese suggestion was transmitted through news agencies rather than from official sources, so they do not wish to comment. However, if the Japanese government officially makes this suggestion recently, the State Department will carefully consider it.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Erroneous Arguments in Japanese Newspapers <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 17th] This morning, Japanese newspapers all criticized the British note to Japan. For example, the "Hochi Shimbun" stated that Japan intends to build a "New Order in East Asia," but Britain completely ignores this. It takes a superficial view and makes presumptuous conjectures, believing that Japan will expand its control over "Manchukuo" and China. In fact, this phenomenon is already disappearing. Moreover, Japan has no intention of permanently stationing troops in China. The purpose of Japan's troop deployment is nothing more than to accelerate the restoration of peace and order in East Asia and prevent it from stepping onto the "red path." The newspaper also criticized the Nine-Power Treaty, saying, "In recent years, due to the intensification of the international situation, the treaty has long lost its effectiveness." (Translator's note: According to a Huitong News Agency dispatch, the "Hochi Shimbun's" commentary even included the phrase "Britain must have lost its mind.") Furthermore, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated, "What we want to ask Britain is whether Britain is determined to protect Japan or continues to support the Chiang regime to provide assistance. If Britain is willing to examine Japan's Far East policy, then Japan is also willing to explain its attitude to Britain."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 18th] The French Atlantic and Mediterranean fleets are scheduled to sail from the military ports of Brest in the south and Toulon this morning to the African coast and the Strait of Gibraltar to conduct winter maneuvers. After the two fleets complete their maneuvers in the Strait of Gibraltar, they will sail to the French Moroccan port of Casablanca in North Africa for joint exercises. The exercise program includes attacking Morocco from the sea and the coastal defense by the defending forces. Chief of Staff Gamelin and Vice Admiral Darlan will simultaneously study the defenses along the Moroccan coast. A total of 80 warships will participate in this exercise, including three battleships, ten cruisers, ten destroyer squadrons, two torpedo boat squadrons, two submarine squadrons, and aircraft carriers. The Atlantic Fleet is scheduled to return to its original garrison in mid-February, but the Mediterranean Fleet intends to continue patrolling Tunisia.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e26">The Victory of the Spanish Government Forces <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>During the Anglo-Italian negotiations in Rome a few days ago, the German and Italian aggressors' expeditionary force in Spain launched a general offensive, and the Spanish rebel leader Franco shamelessly declared that the Spanish war would soon end. However, the Spanish government forces did not show weakness. Their frontline soldiers once again shattered the fierce attacks of the fascist forces, and women, children, and the elderly in the rear held anti-fascist demonstrations and parades under the bombing of aircraft, strengthening the national resistance forces. According to the Paris dispatch on the 18th, the Spanish government forces' general counteroffensive has recovered many important locations. This is a major blow to the arrogant and unscrupulous fascist aggressors. However, after the Rome talks, the German aggressors will inevitably become more rampant in Spain. This is not only a threat to the Spanish government but also directly affects the security of democratic countries in Europe. The severity of the European situation will also affect the future of our resistance. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that countries will urge the League of Nations to adopt a decision that is in line with international justice to rescue the Spanish democracy from the hands of the fascist demons. On the other hand, we ask progressive people and political parties in various countries to urge their respective governments with all their might to ensure that the Spanish government receives a constant and sufficient supply of military supplies and other necessities before the German and Italian invading forces have completely withdrawn from Spanish territory.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Activities of Reactionary Forces in the United States <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>According to an 18th Washington dispatch, "Senator Townsend submitted a proposal to Congress on the 17th, requesting its passage, stipulating that all powers of the government to purchase silver licenses be revoked immediately to protect the domestic silver market in Shanghai." This is clearly an "attack" by reactionary forces in the United States against the Roosevelt administration. Because the U.S. government's recent active foreign policy of opposing fascist aggression is not only hated by the aggressive countries of Italy and Japan but has also aroused opposition from some operators in the oil, cotton, and machinery industries in the country. Just as if Britain implements retaliatory measures against Japan, it will inevitably arouse opposition from Japanese trading stores in the metal and cotton industries in the autonomous territories. What's more, international fascists and national reactionary groups are still using all kinds of special organizations and "opinion" to counterattack. However, judging from the recent situation, these reactionary forces are now greatly weakened, and the threat of fascist aggressors has created great terror among the American masses and even larger industrialists and businessmen. Any reactionary force will eventually be unable to resist the torrent of the era against slaughter and plunder.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Review of U.S. Far East Foreign Policy - Translated by Zi Nong from the December Issue of "Asia" Monthly Last Year <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Japan's reckless actions in China are lawless and simply rely on might makes right. What legal basis is there for the so-called declaration of war zones, excluding all third-country nationals? The U.S. note to Japan on October 6, 1938, was issued for this reason.</p>
<p>This note is very important, not only in U.S. foreign policy but also in dealing with China's future foreign policy. The report passed by the League of Nations General Assembly on October 6, 1937, was fully endorsed by the U.S. This report stated that Japan's actions "are neither based on current legal principles nor on the right of self-defense, and are in great conflict with the Nine-Power Treaty signed on February 6, 1922, and the Paris Peace Pact signed on August 27, 1928." The conference convened in Beijing in November of the same year also lacked concrete measures to implement the Nine-Power Treaty, and only issued a declaration on November 24, 1937, without fully exposing Japan's true face. On September 19, 1938, the League of Nations Administrative Council invited Japan to participate in a meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese conflict in accordance with Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant. On September 22, Japan formally refused to participate. Consequently, on the 30th, the League of Nations Administrative Council passed a resolution stating: "Japan refuses to participate in the meeting. In accordance with the provisions of Article 17, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, the member states of the League may fulfill Article 16 of the Covenant and take individual action in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant." On October 3, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately issued the following declaration:</p>
<p>"According to the provisions of Paragraph 3, the League of Nations recognizes that there is a war between China and Japan, which is inconsistent with the previous statements of the member states that there is no war in China. The Japanese government attaches great importance to this." Moreover, if any country imposes sanctions on Japan based on the resolution of the Administrative Council, Japan will take retaliatory steps in response.</p>
<p>The U.S. note to Japan on October 6 is as important as the joint protests by the U.S., France, and Britain to Japan.</p>
<p>The above is the first time in history that several League of Nations member states have unanimously dealt with two aggressor countries in a non-war manner. According to the League of Nations Covenant, Japan is at war, but China is not. Therefore, logically, Japan is not subject to the restrictions of peacetime international law, while China is protected. The League of Nations' declaration that Japan is at war but China is not means that the U.S. president does not have the obligation to fulfill the Neutrality Act.</p>
<p>However, this situation is unrelated to U.S. policy. Other countries can certainly take more effective actions to implement their policies to protect their own interests. Japan has further destroyed the interests of various countries in China.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the U.S. leads the action, the treaty countries must be consistent because Japan: (1) directly or indirectly discriminates against the commerce and investment of non-Japanese in the occupied areas; (2) monopolizes the markets in the occupied areas, making it impossible for legitimate non-Japanese industries to gain a foothold; (3) Japan interferes with the property and rights and interests of various countries in the occupied areas, including transportation, travel, and residence rights.</p>
<p>Japan's response to the U.S. protest on November 18 was still full of sophistry and evasiveness. At this moment, the U.S. certainly does not recognize Japan's actions to "build order based on international principles in the Far East." Nor does it believe that "this is a necessary condition for Japan's survival" and the policy of "maintaining peace and stability in the Far East." The U.S. government and the public certainly unanimously oppose it. They also strongly condemned the damage to the interests of the American people due to the so-called "inevitable military actions." American people unanimously call on the government to deny the false organizations created by Japan.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the U.S. should stop trading with Japan as retaliation for Japan's damage to U.S. commercial activities in China and its contempt for international law.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed between Japan and the U.S. on February 21, 1911, is the basis for current Japanese-American trade.</p>
<p>Under this treaty, the U.S. grants Japan most-favored-nation treatment, but now Japan is destroying U.S. commerce and property in the occupied areas of China. Since 1923, Japan has announced the termination of this treaty six months in advance. Now, American people must unanimously demand that the U.S. government immediately officially announce the termination of the treaty in response to Japan's termination of the treaty more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>At this point, the entire American public opinion advocates implementing the Nine-Power Treaty to sanction Japan. However, Japan claims that this is an "unfeasible concept and outdated principle" that is not suitable for resolving the current Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>Will the people of the U.S. promote the government to maintain these concepts and international principles? The best way is to provide substantial aid to China in addition to moral support. Can the U.S. transport military supplies worth 100,000 yuan to Burma and Vietnam every month for transfer to the Chinese government? (To be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e29">Strengthening Hong Kong's Defense; Britain Sends Blockade Ships to Hong Kong for Reinforcement; New Cruiser HMS Liverpool Also Ordered to East Asia for Garrison; Hong Kong Government to Establish Anti-Gas Training Centers in Various Districts <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government is actively increasing military preparations to cope with the advent of extraordinary times and strengthening the defensive capabilities of the naval and land forces. In the past year, it has been greatly strengthened in accordance with the established plan. On the naval side, high-speed speedboat teams were dispatched to Hong Kong a few months ago. According to a reporter's investigation, the British Navy Department will send two more ships to Hong Kong, one of which is a blockade and defensive ship recently completed in the UK, and the other is a new type of cruiser. The blockade ship is named "Ballone" and was recently launched in the UK. It is now sailing east. The task of this type of ship is to deploy harbor defense wire nets and obstacles for blockade line engineering. The bow is equipped with a large winch, which is very flexible in operation. One ship, named "________," recently arrived at the Singapore naval port. "Ballone" has also arrived in Singapore and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong during the day. After arriving in Hong Kong, the ship will undergo several tests and then be handed over to the Hong Kong Navy Department for crew deployment and garrison in Hong Kong. As for the British Navy's newly equipped large cruiser "Liverpool," it will also set sail to the east soon to garrison Hong Kong. This ship's equipment is all the latest type, and its combat power is very strong. In the future, after arriving in Hong Kong, Hong Kong's naval defense will have an epoch-making improvement. Furthermore, the training ship "Cornflower" of the Naval Volunteer Force is too old, and the authorities now intend to install new equipment. This matter is under consideration by the relevant parties.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hong Kong air defense authorities have recently been actively making air defense preparations. They are now planning to set up anti-gas training centers in various districts and invite teachers from various schools to give lectures. The Chinese language inspector has issued a notice to various schools on this matter, stating, "In order to popularize anti-gas knowledge, the government will set up anti-gas training centers in various districts to give lectures on anti-gas knowledge. All schools must send teachers to give lectures. Before the establishment of the centers, the book 'Anti-Gas and First Aid' will be distributed to various schools. School principals are requested to collect it from the office as soon as possible."</p>
<h3 id="e30">Suddenly Attacked and Injured; Lin Baisheng Not Out of Danger; Police Ban Visits During Hospitalization; Suspect Arrested and Scheduled to Appear in Court This Morning <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Former Legislative Yuan member and current person in charge of the Hong Kong "South China Daily," Lin Baisheng, was attacked by an assailant in front of the Watson's store in the Alexandra Building on Connaught Road Central at 5:15 PM yesterday, the 17th. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. At 5:20 PM yesterday, the 17th, Lin left the Connaught Road Central restaurant after drinking tea, crossed the tram tracks, and when he reached the front of the Alexandra Building, he was suddenly attacked from behind by an assailant. Lin was caught off guard and fell to the ground. The assailant immediately struck Lin's head with an iron rod. Lin dodged to the left and right, resulting in two injuries to the back of his head. The right corner of his forehead and the end of his eyebrow were also cut. Fortunately, the felt hat that Lin was wearing was still on his head, providing some protection. Therefore, although the assailant struck him several times, he did not hit any vital areas. At the time, passersby thought it was a fight and watched from the sidelines. An English soldier who happened to be passing by saw this and came to his aid, immediately arresting a suspect and sending him to the police station. According to the suspect's statement at the police station, his name is Chen Lin, 27 years old, a painter, and he lives in the Painters' Union on Shandong Street, Kowloon. The police immediately sent people to the union to inquire, but everyone said they did not know the person. It is reported that Chen Lin refused to admit to this attack and denied that anyone else was involved. The case was originally scheduled to be heard in the Central Magistracy yesterday morning, but the police requested a postponement because they still needed to collect evidence. If the collection is completed yesterday, it can be presented to the court today. Because Lin was suddenly attacked, the police refused any visits to Lin at the Queen Mary Hospital, regardless of who the person was, until the case is clarified. According to Lin's wife, the doctors reported that although Lin had lost too much blood at the time of the injury, the dangerous period had passed, and he should recover in about three weeks. According to the "Hong Kong Telegraph" last night, the English man, Robertson, who pursued the assailant that day, had just walked out of the exhibition room of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. When he heard a cry for help, he saw a person falling to the ground and an assailant walking towards the post office. When he walked towards the scene, he saw another person holding an axe and hitting Lin's head, who was already lying on the ground, three times in a row. Robertson immediately shouted for help. The assailant hoped to escape through the alley between Gloucester Road and the Connaught Road Central restaurant. Robertson continued to pursue him. At that time, passersby all stood by and watched. An English medical officer, Hepworth, walked out of the Gloucester Road arcade. At that time, the man was caught. Hepworth also chased and assisted in the arrest, until Police Constable Hawkins arrived and was handed over to him for custody. According to another source, Lin is still not out of danger, and there was no improvement last night. It is also reported that Lin went to the political department of Chung Tin Bank that day and was attacked after leaving.</p>

<h3 id="e34">×× Japanese Merchants in Hong Kong Go to Guangzhou to Open Branches; Most Japanese Merchants Hesitate <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign news, some Japanese merchants in Hong Kong recently ×××××× went to Guangzhou to conduct business. All Japanese people who have shops in Hong Kong must open a branch in Guangzhou to sell Japanese goods. However, most Japanese people think that Guangzhou has become a dead market with no business. Even if they open a business, it will be useless. They are also afraid that when the Chinese army counterattacks and rushes into Guangzhou in the future, their lives will be in danger. Therefore, except for a small number who comply with the order, most of them are hesitant.</p>
<h3 id="e35">South China Women's Festival Association Branch: Preparing for the Second Refugee Industrial Cooperative; Yesterday's Welcome to National Women's Association President Guan Huazhen <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The South China Women's Festival Association Branch held its third meeting yesterday at the Winsor Hotel. Attendees included Liu Wang Liming, Han Du, Mr. and Mrs. Li Fang, Liang Bao Ci, Liu Liang, Mrs. Xu Zhenyang, Guan Huazhen, Zhu Shaoping, and others. At 11:00 AM, Chairwoman Liu Wang Liming rose to deliver a speech and briefly introduced the attendees. Huang Han Du reported on the establishment and current state of the refugee industrial cooperative. It was stated that the cooperative members work during the day, making shoes, sewing children's clothing, and knitting sweaters, etc. Most of the various crafts are exported and sold to supply children in childcare facilities. Regarding spiritual training, it has already begun, with education conducted every evening, and lectures given weekly. Currently, the cooperative members are extremely enthusiastic about seeking knowledge and hope that various bookstores and newspaper offices will donate various newspapers and magazines, etc. Following this, Mrs. Li Fang reported that the refugee industrial cooperative has been established, but it can only accommodate fifty refugees. Currently, several letters from refugees requesting accommodation arrive daily. The establishment of a second branch is extremely urgent. After the report, everyone unanimously agreed and immediately decided to establish the second branch as soon as possible. The plan for its establishment includes major departments such as textiles, chemistry, commerce, and general handicrafts, each with its own factory. The planning and design are to be handled by the association's production team. After this proposal was passed, matters related to the association's deposit withdrawal procedures were also discussed. Then, a gathering began, and Ms. Guan Huazhen, President of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, was invited to speak. Ms. Guan came to Hong Kong from Shanghai and will proceed to Nanjing to report to the central government. In her speech yesterday, she earnestly encouraged the women's community, hoping they would be determined to work hard for the country and enhance the status of Chinese women in the world. Finally, Mr. Zhu Shaoping, President of the Chinese Review Society, who had just arrived in Hong Kong from Europe, spoke, elaborating on the expansion of armaments in various European countries, stating that Britain's armament expansion has not yet been completed. Therefore, in the recent past, Britain has not had the strength to contend with various European countries. The European war has not yet reached the outbreak stage, and his conclusion is that a European war in 1939 will be unavoidable.</p>

<p>The order of U.S. shortwave broadcasting rarely allows it to reach our country. According to Ms. Smith, a Commercial Attaché at the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai, when the World's Fair is held on Treasure Island in San Francisco next month, trial adjustments of the antenna will begin. A 20-kilowatt shortwave broadcasting station will broadcast to the Far East. For these few months, broadcasts from California to the Far East will take place, with appropriate wavelengths at various times of the day. In the future, the aforementioned broadcasting station will be moved to Belmont, California. It seems that Hong Kong radio users will have more to enjoy.</p>
<h3 id="e38">[Finding Cents to Cross the Sea]! <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>A New Type of Business at the Ferry Pier</p>
<p>When you go from Hong Kong Island to Tsim Sha Tsui, or from Tsim Sha Tsui to Hong Kong Island, taking advantage of the fact that the third-class fare on the ×× Ferry Company's small ferries is four copper coins, but if you give them a half-dollar coin, you won't get any change. For a dime, you only get five copper coins back. Similarly, from Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, or Sham Shui Po, taking a small ferry to Hong Kong Island, although it's cheaper than from Tsim Sha Tsui by one copper coin, you get one coin back for a half-dollar, and six coins back for a dime. Everyone knows this. Most women are unwilling to be taken advantage of and often start many arguments. But let them laugh; the ticket sellers are "reaping the benefits"!</p>
<p>Therefore, most people crossing the sea, except for ignorant women and children, buy newspapers or other things at the pier, exchanging for copper coins before boarding the ferry, unwilling to let the ticket sellers profit. Because of this, a new type of business, "finding cents to cross the sea," has emerged. In the past few days, at the ferry pier in Tsim Sha Tsui, a group of eleven or twelve-year-old children can be seen holding copper coins in their hands, calling out to passengers crossing the sea, "Finding cents to cross the sea!" Everyone assumes that these are newspaper vendors who have too many copper coins and want to exchange them for silver coins. So they eagerly take out a "dime," but you only get four cents back. When you ask them why, they turn around and run away, saying as they go, "Anyway, you're going to lose out, giving it to us is better than giving it to the ticket sellers!" The passengers then realize they've been tricked and can't help but curse, but they adopt the attitude of vegetable sellers, letting people laugh or scold, and doing what they want. They earn a few dimes to a dollar a day.</p>
<p>From then on, the ticket booth at the Tsim Sha Tsui ferry is quiet, but the verbal battles at the pier are even more lively than before. The ticket sellers, seeing their business being snatched away, can't help but fly into a rage. But these groups of children are all from the mischievous children's squad, accustomed to selling cakes and tea and dodging "inspectors." When the police arrive, they scatter, and the ticket sellers have no way to deal with them!</p>
<p>This new novelty! Finding cents to cross the sea is low-risk and high-profit. Of course, people are rushing to do it. I believe that in the near future, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, and even Hong Kong Island will be filled with their figures. At that time, the ticket sellers will really be caught between laughter and tears!</p>

<h3 id="e40">Children's Welfare Association Industrial Training Institute Established; Training Children to Produce Industrial Products; Over a Hundred Students Achieving Excellent Results <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>To adapt to the needs of children's education in extraordinary times, the Hong Kong Branch of the China Wartime Children's Relief Association has established three children's shelters in Hong Kong to accommodate and educate children transferred from the war zone. The association, wanting to train children in industrial production skills, planned to establish an industrial training institute, but it was delayed due to financial constraints. Recently, a benefactor, Xu Rangcheng, donated funds to establish one, attached to the First Shelter. The institute opened a week ago, attached to the classroom of the Second Shelter in the old National Hospital, using the hospital canteen. In terms of management and administration, there is a supervisor and heads of various sections, responsible for promoting the institute's affairs. Xu Rangcheng serves as the supervisor, Su Hanpeng as the design director, and Zheng Chengyi as the education director. In addition, there are several male and female professors and designers, teaching sawing, planing, grinding, carving, woodworking, tailoring, wax flower making, paper art, and handicrafts. The crafts that the children learn at the institute include fabric, flowers, paper, and woodworking. Most of the products made are toys. In the flower category, there are paper flowers and wax flowers. The paper crafts include making paper boxes and toys. Woodworking products mainly consist of lifelike toys such as wooden lions and wooden horses. National defense weapons such as anti-aircraft guns and tanks are also made. There are over a hundred students, all of whom are children from the Second Shelter, mostly transferred from Hankou, aged between ten and sixteen. (乙) Those who participate in factory registration, if they belong to the factory union federation, must register at a higher fee. Those who are older learn woodworking, while those who are younger learn flower and paper crafts. The learning time is from 1:10 PM to 4:00 PM every day. The morning is study time. Due to space constraints, the institute cannot accommodate a large number of children. However, those in charge are paying close attention to expansion and have already formulated a plan to open a morning class in the future, accommodating more children, allowing them to learn crafts in the morning and study in the afternoon. After opening both morning and afternoon classes, the two classes can take turns learning crafts, and the number of students can be significantly increased, while the classroom problem can also be solved. This is truly a win-win solution.</p>

<h3 id="e42">A Letter from Hong Kong via Annam to Longzhou <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Editor's Note: This is a letter from a friend at Sun Yat-sen University to our newspaper's reporter, reporting on his journey from Hong Kong via Annam to Longzhou, Guangxi. It is vivid and interesting. We are publishing it for our readers.</p>
<p>Dear ××××,</p>
<p>The "Zhibade" set sail at 4 PM, with a capacity for 400 people, yet only twelve passengers including us. The calculating gentlemen on board divided it into several sections: this is the dining hall, this is the meeting room, this is the reading room. They even created a dance floor in the center, turning the ship into a large hotel on the water.</p>
<p>The journey was smooth and calm. No one felt seasick. Compared to the situation of being splashed with pig feces in Guangzhou Bay, while not heaven and earth different, it's at least the distance from Weicheng Road to Connaught Road.</p>
<p>Because of the calmness, we could eat and talk. Brother ××'s preserved plums, Brother ××'s apples, and Brother ××'s oranges all went into my stomach. "Eating well and drinking in moderation" was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>The first-class cabin and third-class are essentially the same. The difference is that first-class has a canvas bed and only three meals, while third-class has a bed and an extra meal. Spending those ten Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to twenty silver dollars, isn't worth it. My advice to Brother ×× when you come is that if you don't want to sit in second-class, please enter the "first-class."</p>
<p>We arrived in Haiphong on the morning of the 31st. The ship didn't move after docking. Someone came to take our passports, but the doctor never came to inspect. Everyone's luggage was moved onto the dock. It's best to ask a hotel to take care of it on the ship. As far as I know, the "Ertianran" Hotel is the most reliable. Once the luggage was all moved, customs officials herded us, people and things like a flock of ducks, into a large customs house to wait for inspection.</p>
<p>The room was dark, crowded, and the air was smelly and humid. It's best to bring some "Baifeng Dan" to avoid getting sick from the stuffiness.</p>
<p>Luggage inspection was extremely strict, turning everything inside out. The Annamese × is hateful. If they see something they like, they secretly stuff it into their trouser pocket. So you must watch them personally to prevent things from disappearing.</p>
<p>Anything new, such as clothes, fabrics, cosmetics, and medicines, will be taken away for taxation. When they take it, be sure to have them write a receipt. A student from Zhejiang University didn't know this rule, and half a box of his things was completely lost, and he almost cried.</p>
<p>Keep this receipt well. In the afternoon or the next day, the hotel staff will accompany you to the customs to pay the tax and retrieve your things.</p>
<p>This time, because the consul said a word to the customs, I was exempted from inspection, even though there wasn't anything special inside. It saved me a lot of trouble, so I consider myself lucky.</p>
<p>Also, pay special attention: do not bring matches or needles. One box of matches is fined 20 Vietnamese piastres. Brother ×× is a smoker, so check your pockets before going ashore to avoid adding a "red number" to your budget.</p>
<p>After the luggage inspection is complete, follow the hotel porter to the hotel. Be wary of pickpockets along the way, especially for your hat and glasses. One careless moment, and a "hat-snatching wind" will blow, and your "hat will be gone, who knows where." The hotel is reasonably priced, charging 1.5 Vietnamese piastres per day including food, 1 cent per piece of luggage for handling, and 7 cents for a "guild fee" for passport endorsement.</p>
<p>Haiphong looks no different from other places in China. In fact, there is no difference. The Annamese people, in their short gauze robes, long trousers, Daoist caps, and wooden clogs, do have a certain charm like figures in paintings. It's a pity they are thin and have unremarkable features. Compared to people who eat large steaks, drink big glasses of beer, stick out their chests, and wear leather shoes, one can draw a clear line between these groups in the world.</p>
<p>If customs and passport endorsement don't cause any trouble, there's no need to stay overnight in Haiphong. Take the train directly to Hanoi. The trains in Annam are smaller and narrower than those in China. First, second, and third-class have luggage cars, but fourth-class luggage must be carried with you. Therefore, taking fourth-class allows you to take care of your luggage yourself, which is also an advantage.</p>
<p>Compared to third-class, taking third-class is not worth it. Not only is the fare more than double, but the luggage fee is also twice as expensive, and the seats are all hard wooden boards. Why bother sitting in third-class? The luggage limit is 30 kilograms per person. Beyond that, it's calculated per kilogram based on the distance.</p>
<p>I took the train to Hanoi at 1 PM on the 31st, and it was after 8 PM when I arrived. Again, there were Ertianran Hotel staff to pick up guests.</p>
<p>I spent the New Year in Hanoi.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, I strolled around Hanoi alone. First, I went to the Royal Park, where the trees and water were lush, and the scale was quite large. There were also small animals inside. An old tiger with a white forehead paced back and forth, stepping on the squares, without the "majesty of a mountain lord" and more like a schoolteacher.</p>
<p>Leaving the Royal Park, I went to West Lake. Hearing this name, I had some "thoughts of hometown." That day, the north wind was fierce, and the river was green and glittering, reflecting the cold light. There were neither long dikes nor tender willows, nor distant mountain mists. If the West Lake of my hometown is a virgin, then this one can only be considered a widow.</p>
<p>From West Lake, I went to the Sword Lake, which is in the city center. In the middle of the lake is a temple, and next to it is a dilapidated tower. The flowerbeds by the lake are lively, resembling the Guangzhou city scene. The past seemed like yesterday, and I couldn't help but linger.</p>
<p>This walk took two hours, and the rickshaw cost only 1 cent per hour, so the total cost was only 3 cents.</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese are very powerful in business. There is a Guangdong Street, and walking through it, you almost think you're on Yonghan Road or Gaodi Street.</p>
<p>There is no direct train from Inner Hanoi to Longzhou. You must first go to Qiongshan or Tongdeng, then take a bus on the Longqiong Road directly.</p>
<p>I took a bus at 6 AM on the 2nd, arriving in Tongdeng at noon. After Haiphong, there were no more inspections along the way.</p>
<p>Tongdeng is a mountain village, formerly known as "Wenyuan" in Chinese. It is the border between China and Vietnam. A train station and a customs house stand isolated in the wilderness. The small market town is about half a mile away, with only two streets. Recently, because of the increased traffic, there are a few small inns.</p>
<p>Sitting at the entrance of the Fengjin Hotel were drivers in peaked caps, with their collars open and wearing large workman's trousers. They spoke loudly in "Shanghai dialect," surrounded by many women, like stars surrounding the Big Dipper. It reminded me of the unapproachable arrogance of the village coachmen described by Washington Irving.</p>
<p>The village was filled with cars of all kinds. This small mountain village had become a transportation hub. Because there were no buses to Longzhou in the afternoon, I took a stroll to Zhennanguan.</p>
<p>Along the way, the mountains were continuous. On the left was a steep cliff, and on the right was a valley. Walking along it felt like walking along an ancient city wall, with a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>About five kilometers away, I saw an antique pass standing in front of me. On the plaque in the front was Zhennanguan, and next to the wall were four large stones with the words "Important Southern Frontier" written on them by Lu Rongting. On the back of the pass was the inscription "Gongji Gate." Entering the gate was a branch office of the Anti-Opium Commissioner's Office. When the bus enters Longzhou territory, it must stop here for passport inspection.</p>
<p>Looking towards Annam from the pass, the mountains on the left and right extend in both directions, perfectly framing two highways. The mountains in front stand tall, like a natural barrier. Because of this majestic terrain, I thought of the industry of our ancestors, and I couldn't help but feel fascinated.</p>
<p>Along the way, I saw Annamese laborers with dark faces and haggard expressions, deeply showing the suffering of living under someone else's roof.</p>
<p>Because I was waiting for a bus, I stayed another day on the 3rd. On the afternoon of the 4th, I finally got on the Longliang bus and returned to the embrace of my motherland. Seeing every stream and every mountain along the way, I felt extra affection.</p>
<p>In the hazy twilight, we drove into Longjin County. The flat and wide road and the lush trees on both sides told us that Longzhou had also been modernized.</p>
<p>The colleagues from the Normal College and the Research Institute were still stranded on the way to Guangxi, following the school ship and had not arrived yet. Only Teacher ×× was there. After a short separation of three months, seeing each other suddenly under the dim light was truly a joyful surprise.</p>
<p>The next day, someone arrived leisurely. He had taken the bus ahead. Shaking hands and looking at each other felt like ten years had passed. I conveyed all of your regards, and he was extremely happy to hear them.</p>
<p>It has been raining continuously here for days, and it's quite chilly. The thermometer is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, so Brother ×× and the others should not assume that the southern border is hot and abandon all your warm clothes.</p>
<p>Teacher × is heading to Kunming via Hanoi. We were delayed because of the bus, but we should also arrive in Kunming in a day or two.</p>
<p>Longzhou is not a large city, and because people are afraid of air raid alerts, the streets are deserted before 11 PM. It's practically lifeless. But prices are very high, almost twice as high as in Guangzhou, because there are too many "suffering brothers" and supply cannot meet demand.</p>
<p>Zhongshan Park is quite large. It used to be the place where General Fubo stationed troops. Climbing to the top of the mountain and looking up, the sea of clouds and mountains stretch endlessly. Thinking of the long and great achievements of our nation, I believe there will be a day of revival. I couldn't help but look up and sigh.</p>
<p>Because my heart is unsettled, I cannot sit down and write more. This letter was written hastily. I hope my old friends will understand.</p>

<p>The American President Lines' ship "President Harrison" departed from New York on the 2nd of last month. It was scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today. However, when the ship was sailing from Honolulu to Yokohama, it encountered severe storms, delaying its arrival in Yokohama until the 16th of this month, three days behind schedule. The ship has already departed from Kobe yesterday and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong on the 21st (Saturday) afternoon. The timing for its departure from Hong Kong to the Philippines and other American territories is still undetermined. Also, the company's ship "President Pierce" departed from San Francisco on the 30th of last month via Honolulu, Japan, and Shanghai. It is also expected to arrive on the 21st (Saturday). However, the departure time from Hong Kong to the Philippines has been changed to 4 PM on the 22nd (Sunday). This is the company's first ship of the year to come to Hong Kong via Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Taishan ship, represented by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., is delayed until this morning. It will dock at Pier A9 in Sheung Wan. Once the cargo is unloaded, it will immediately set sail for Shanghai and America.</p>
<p>The Fuan of Xixing Company and the Anli of Siyi Company joined the Hong Kong-Macau route on the 17th. The Jinshan of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong-Macau Company also sailed to Macau at 5:30 PM yesterday (the 18th). Currently, there are nine ships traveling between Hong Kong and Macau daily, excluding those that are still under repair. The ship names and schedules are listed below for travelers:</p>

<h3 id="e44">What I Saw and Heard on the Guangdong-Guangxi Route After the Fall of Guangzhou (3) Japanese Troops Invade Towns and Cities Along the West River, Guangxi Troops Move East to Strengthen the Defense Line <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Troops from a certain division in Guangxi Province also moved eastward in a continuous stream to Zhaoqing to defend. The ferries and tugboats above Zhaoqing to Wuzhou are used to supply military transport, with very little space for passengers and goods. Only one ship, the Southwest, travels between Zhaoqing and Wuzhou every other day to maintain the limited transportation. A few days later, the Guangxi troops completed their deployment in Zhaoqing, making the defenses upstream of the West River more solid than before, which greatly stabilized the people's hearts. As a result, the stores in Zhaoqing gradually resumed business. However, there are air raid alerts every day, as Japanese planes constantly fly in to bomb and harass.</p>
<p>On November 5th, I took the Southwest ship from Zhaoqing to Wuzhou. Shortly after docking at around 9 AM, an air raid alert sounded. Five Japanese planes flew from downstream of Sanshui and attacked Wuzhou, dropping bombs on Fuhui, Jiaozui, the sulfuric acid plant, Guangxi University, and other places. As soon as the citizens heard the alert, they fled to the caves in the mountains at the foot of Beishan Mountain, Bingjingyong, and Longmu Temple. After landing, the reporter also followed the citizens to seek shelter. The Wuzhou air raid shelters were dug into the mountains, winding and circuitous. Each cave could hold fifty or sixty people, or even more than two hundred. There are about four hundred private and public shelters in the city, which can accommodate more than sixty or seventy thousand people. Such good air raid shelters are rare in the provinces and cities of South China. Is this due to the natural terrain?</p>
<p>The day after Guangzhou fell, Wuzhou was placed under martial law, and many defensive fortifications were added to the key passes. Then, the elderly, weak, women, and children in the city were evacuated. Because the number of refugees entering Guangxi from Guangdong was extremely crowded, the authorities temporarily exempted ships from entry inspection to facilitate the entry of refugees. However, hotels and restaurants still carried out inspections. Visitors to Wuzhou who stayed in hotels were only allowed to stay for three days. After that, they had to find a local store or relative with a job to guarantee them. The intention was probably to prevent spies. Although the population of Wuzhou was ordered to be dispersed, the number increased daily, as refugees from western Guangdong used Wuzhou as a gathering point. The market was quite deserted in the morning, but as busy as usual in the afternoon and evening, because people had to avoid Japanese air raids in the morning. Imported goods such as kerosene, yarn, matches, wool, cloth, cotton knitwear, cigarettes, and flour were one to two times more expensive than before the fall of Guangzhou. Local products such as grain, rice, pork, chicken, duck, and beef were particularly cheap. High-quality rice was only five or six silver dollars per hundred catties, pork was fourteen or fifteen silver dollars per hundred catties, and chicken was twenty-five cents per catty. This was because the downstream transportation was blocked, and the supply of local products exceeded demand, so imported goods were expensive and exported goods were cheap. However, the peasant economy was greatly affected. The transportation within the province, such as Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Longzhou, and Baise, was not blocked, despite being busy with military transport. Although transportation outside the province was greatly affected, routes from Longzhou to Vietnam, Nanning to Beihai, and Guilin to Guangzhou Bay were still passable, but the long detour made transportation costs very uneconomical. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, Guangxi Province was under serious threat, and its responsibility for resisting the war became even greater. In early November, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai rushed from the northern front to Guilin to convene commanders and senior generals from all fronts to receive instructions. At the same time, the military and political affairs of the province were also reorganized. Where should heavy troops be stationed, which counties should be designated as security areas, who should command which route, the allocation of guerrilla units in each county, the transfer of vehicles, and the collection of military salaries and equipment all had detailed arrangements. At the same time, politically, preparations were being made to implement popularly elected county magistrates in all counties in the province in January of the 28th year. Before the popular elections, starting from November of this year (the 27th year), all county magistrates in counties bordering Guangdong and close to the war zone were to be filled by people from the original counties, such as Huaiji, Cangwu, Cen, Rong County, Guilin, and Lian County, which have already been implemented. The establishment of county councils will be limited to the end of this year. All heads of districts, townships, towns, villages, and streets under the jurisdiction of each county will be elected by the local masses, implementing a county autonomy system. All detained family members who had escaped military conscription in each county will be released from December, because the situation is so critical that the authorities hope to unite the army and the people to save the country together, so military and political aspects are being reformed.

<h3 id="e47">Investigation of the Ginseng and Antler Market in Hong Kong <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Ginseng and antler are both medicinal supplements. Both are famous products of Northeast China. Ginseng produced in Jilin and deer antler produced in Guandong are particularly prized. In addition, there is Korean ginseng from Korea and miscellaneous ginseng from Soviet Russia, but their efficacy is not as good as that of our domestic products. As for American ginseng from North America, its nature is a cooling agent. Antler includes deer antler, elk antler, and deer tail. The antlers sold on the market are all produced in Northeast China.</p>
<p>The annual trade volume of ginseng and antler in Hong Kong reaches tens of millions of dollars. Recently, due to various reasons, this number has plummeted. The decline of Donghua is the most obvious. During its peak period, Hong Kong sold four to five million dollars worth of Northeast ginseng and antler annually, but now it has shrunk to less than one million dollars. The sales of American ginseng were more than ten million dollars, but now it only recovers five to six million dollars. The sales of miscellaneous ginseng from Soviet Russia used to be eighty million dollars, but now it is only twenty to thirty thousand dollars.</p>
<p>About 80% of Hong Kong's antler trade is shipped to other regions, and only 20% is sold locally. In addition to Guangdong and Guangxi, Northeast ginseng and antler are sold in Southeast Asia and the old and new Gold Mountains (San Francisco). American ginseng is mainly shipped to Southeast Asia, followed by Guangdong and Guangxi. Since the fall of the four northeastern provinces, the mountains and forests are feared to harbor guerrillas. Therefore, those who enter the mountains to hunt with firearms are absolutely prohibited, and the harvesting of ginseng has also been affected. As a result, the production of ginseng and antler in the Northeast has decreased by 60% this year. In addition, due to transportation issues, trade is not easy, so the market is becoming increasingly depressed. Although the source of American ginseng is not affected, the domestic market has disappeared due to the war, and it now only relies on Southeast Asia. According to statistics, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the average loss in Hong Kong's ginseng and antler trade has been one-third.</p>
<p>Korean ginseng from Korea is cheaper, so its sales are very widespread. The annual sales are worth about six to seven million dollars, and most of it is shipped to Guangdong and Guangxi. Since the July 7th Incident, the Chinese people have regarded it as enemy goods and no longer care about it. Hong Kong ginseng firms and foreign companies have stopped ordering it, and all old goods stored by various firms are sealed by the trade association and sold at a discount within a limited time. Currently, there is no trace of Korean ginseng in the Hong Kong market.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Li Hua Cup Football Preliminary Round: Army-Navy Representatives Selected Yesterday; Healy Appointed Goalkeeper; Seven Players from Middlesex Selected <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) The preliminary round of this year's Li Hua Cup is scheduled to be held this weekend. It is scheduled for 3:30 PM on Saturday, with the Army-Navy United Team playing against the Western Civilians Team at the Kowloon Football Club field in Sham Shui Po. At 3:30 PM on Sunday afternoon, the Chinese United Team will play against the Navy United Team at the Hong Kong Football Club field in Happy Valley. Both games will last for 90 minutes and will be based on a knockout system. There will definitely be very exciting performances at that time.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, only the Civilians Team had selected their players for the four strong teams. As for the Chinese United Team, although their players had been selected once, the Football Association felt that the selected players did not have enough appeal, which would affect the association's income and hinder the arrival of the Philippine team to Hong Kong. Therefore, it instructed the selection committee to conduct another selection and planned to invite Li Huitang to play. Based on this, the selection committee has recently conducted a new round of selection, so the Chinese United Team has not yet finalized its players. As for the Army-Navy United Teams, they had not yet been selected as of yesterday.</p>
<p>According to this reporter's information, the Army United Team was formed yesterday and is quite strong. What is surprising is that Pearson from the Middlesex was not selected as the center forward, but Winton from the Army Service Corps was selected. As for the selection of the goalkeeper, Healy from the Kowloon Club was already expected by this reporter. After he was transferred from the Middlesex Infantry Team to the Tak Shing Team, he joined the Kowloon Club because the Tak Shing Team did not have a First Division football team. However, as a soldier, he should return to the Army team when civilians and soldiers play against each other, and there is no other army goalkeeper who can surpass him in skill.</p>
<p>Judging from the current strength of the Army United Team and the Civilians Team, the Army seems to be stronger. However, the Civilians representatives are mostly from the Kowloon Club, and the game is held at the Kowloon Club field, so the Civilians have a geographical advantage. It is unknown whether this team can pose a considerable threat to the Army because of this. The list of players for the other two teams will be released later. [Old Friends of the Football Field]</p>

<h3 id="e49">Women's Basketball Tournament: South China Fights Hard to Defeat HKU; Snowflakes Lost to Overseas Chinese; Sze Sze Crushes Paul <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Three matches were held in the Youth Basketball Court last night for the Ordinary Women's Basketball Tournament. In the first match, South China played against HKU. After the start of the game, South China launched the first attack. Li Ruomei and Li Yufen broke through the defense line and repeatedly scored. In the first quarter, South China had an advantage of eight to one. HKU tried to recover lost ground. Li Huijuan, Li Zongyu, and Zou Defan worked hard to attack, but South China's defense was solid and there was no development. Li Ruomei and Li Yufen counterattacked again and continued to score points. In the second quarter, HKU was still defeated by two to sixteen. HKU changed its strategy and launched a full-scale attack. Zou Defan, Li Zongyu, and Li Huijuan cooperated with each other and made some gains. However, South China's Li Ruomei, Li Yufen, and Zhang Meiwei presented another leap. The people of Hong Kong were surrounded by enemies on all sides. In the third quarter, South China still won with a score of 26 to 9. At this time, HKU struggled desperately. Zou Defan made some gains, but South China's military power was at its peak. HKU finally lost with a score of 15 to 34. In the second match, Overseas Chinese played against Snowflakes. Chen Rongtang from Overseas Chinese returned to the battle that night, so his offensive power was stronger. He cooperated with Liu Shouguang. Although Snowflakes tried hard to lead, the strength was too different, and they willingly gave way. At the beginning of the competition, Chen Rongtang and Liu Shouguang from Overseas Chinese successively shot and scored, opening the record first. The Snowflakes sisters also worked hard to fight. Liu Qihuan and Luo Qiaobin scored, taking the first quarter with a score of 7 to 4. Seeing this situation, Overseas Chinese used all their strength and saw Chen Rongtang and Liu Shouguang launch a continuous barrage, recovering lost ground. In the second quarter, they reversed the defeat into a victory with a score of 11 to 18. Taking advantage of the victory, Overseas Chinese pressured the Snowflakes' position. Liu Shouguang and Chen Rongtang frequently made free throws. Snowflakes were in a state of collapse. After Luo Qiaobin's second attack, the situation turned around. However, Chen Huizhen from Overseas Chinese tried her best to stop the incoming troops and finished the third quarter with a score of 31 to 21. After that, Snowflakes still fought hard, but Chen Rongtang and Liu Shouguang from Overseas Chinese used a pincer attack, shooting accurately and taking a remote lead in points. After Luo Qiaobin also shot remotely, reporting back some points, the final whistle had already sounded. Overseas Chinese won with a score of 38 to 27. In the third match, Paul played against Sze Sze. After the outbreak of the war, Sze Sze's momentum was loud. Wang Huixian and Cao Bao broke through the pass and went straight to the people. However, Paul resisted stubbornly. Zhang Zhaolan and Su Man'e seized the opportunity and repeatedly built miracles. In the first quarter, Paul took the lead with a score of 9 to 8. Sze Sze changed Huang Lihe to defense because the long attack was ineffective, and the protective offensive was slightly frustrated. Huang Dongfen, Wei Bao, and Zhi Huixian divided their troops to raid and repeatedly hit several goals. Zhang Zhaolan and Su Man'e also reciprocated. In the second quarter, Sze Sze reversed with 18 to 13. From then on, the guarantee fell into turmoil. In the third quarter, she lost again with a score of 16 to 25. After that, they fought each other, and Lian, Zhun Wan, and Su Man'e and Zhang Zhaolan all made progress. However, Huang Fen and Han Huilian from Sze Sze also succeeded one after another, so they won with a score of 34 to 21.</p>

<p>The registration for the First Hong Kong Chinese Cross-Country Race Conference will be held from yesterday to tomorrow.

This year's awards were donated by party and state dignitaries, news circles, education circles, and enthusiastic social figures. It is now scheduled to display all the prizes in the display cabinets of Kowloon Electric Company at the corner of Yau Ma Tei Nathan Road and Jordan Road from January 20th to 21st.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Re-discussion on the Selection of the Chinese United Team for the Li Hua Cup <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>In response to the needs of the Football Association, the representatives of the Chinese United Team for the preliminary round of the Li Hua Cup will be selected separately.</p>
<p>I already have a proposed lineup yesterday, which is as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Junqian Luo Weiquan Hou Rongsheng Xu Jingcheng Liang Rongzhao Song Lingsheng Hou Chengtuo Zou Wenzhi Li Huitang Zhuo Shijin Chen Bingt</p>
<p>I believe that my purely objective proposal will be sympathetic to the selection committee.</p>
<p>However, it is said that Song Lingsheng's foot injury has not healed, and he may not be selected. In that case, the front line will have to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>If Lingsheng is really not selected, then Liang Rongzhao should be placed on the right, Xu Jingcheng in the center, and Luo Weiquan on the left. As for the left inner midfielder, Miao Huaguo must be selected.</p>
<p>Brother Sangyu advocates that Rongzhao play as the right inner defender and partner with Huaguo, which is also a good idea.</p>
<p>I believe that Rongzhao has not played this tune for a long time, and once he defends the inner midfielder, he may not perform as well as Rongsheng.</p>
<p>It must be known that the forward line is the backbone of the entire team. In the current situation, the Chinese United Team must strengthen the defense line to support the front line, which is the best strategy.</p>
<p>I still dislike Huaguo's slow movements, fearing that he will not be able to resist the rock of the Navy United Team, Armstrong Lang. However, if the low authority is to allow Lingsheng to remain in the forward line despite his foot injury, then who else can be found for the left inner midfielder besides Huaguo? But what about Chen Guangyu of the Police Force? Because he is Chinese, he is qualified to be selected, so I have another proposal as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Junqian Chen Guangyu Hou Rongsheng Luo Weiquan Xu Jingcheng Liang Rongzhao Hou Chengtuo Zou Wenzhi Li Huitang Zhuo Shijin Chen Bingt</p>
<p>Brother Sangyu also advocates using Liu Shicheng in the right forward position. If Lingsheng is indeed not selected, there is no problem with using Shicheng. However, it is still necessary to consider using Shicheng to transfer Rongzhao to play as an inner defender.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that because I don't trust Huaguo very much to check the right wing of the Navy United Team, I suggest that Wei Quan or Guangyu be used to play the left inner defender. I don't know if Xian Guangyu can be elected, but it is reasonable to say that he may be. (From Tai Sui of the Football Field)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Volleyball Charity Match Terminated <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Female Nurses Association, facing the bloodied soldiers fighting bravely in the front and not afraid of injury, and feeling the lack of medicine from time to time, recently launched a volleyball charity match to use the proceeds to purchase medicines for use in the front. The Hong Kong University and Chinese University teams were invited to participate in the competition at that time. However, this matter was not carried out in the end. It was found that the Hong Kong Nurses Association and the Youth Special Committee of Hong Kong Journalists held a volleyball charity competition in the short term, and there was a time conflict, so this matter has been stopped.</p>

<p>Entertainment...The Adventures of Marco Polo</p>
<p>This film is based on the era of Kublai Khan in the Yuan Dynasty of our country, and tells the story of the Venetian merchant Marco Polo's business trip to China. It is a film with historical significance, but it cannot be regarded as a historical film. Because most of the plot is nonsense, we dare not believe it. The director and the director have adopted a quite serious attitude towards this film, but in order to cater to the psychology of American audiences, they reluctantly inserted some love threads, which completely destroyed the historical meaning of the film. Otherwise, the film's magnificent set, elaborate costumes, and the great and tense war scenes would have been quite successful in portraying the era of Kublai Khan in the Yuan Dynasty.</p>
<p>Gary Cooper plays a Venetian merchant in this film who travels all the way from Europe to Beijing. Because of his special experience with women, he wins Kublai Khan's favor and is employed, entering the palace to flirt and cause trouble. Later, when Kublai Khan goes to war with Japan, traitors cause chaos. He risks his life to ask for help, remove the traitors, and support the royal family. This possible American star presents his usual style of flirting and being suave in this film.</p>
<p>The heroine, Sigrid Gurie, is a Norwegian stage actress. This film is her debut on the screen. Her second work is "Algiers," which will be screened in Hong Kong soon. Although her style is completely different in the two films, she leaves us with the same perfect impression.</p>
<p>Empress...Boy of the Streets</p>
<p>Mickey's Bed Boy With the Circus</p>
<p>This long slapstick film, led by Tom Kealey and a group of street urchins, is a sequel to Tom's "Boy of the Streets." However, due to the story, it is obviously not as touching as the previous film. However, the director's handling of this film is very lively and interesting. Several gags are still satisfying. The various performances of the circus are very exciting. The performances of a group of child stars are very outstanding. In the end, it is still an entertaining film.</p>
<p>Peace...Scipio Africanus</p>
<p>Scipione L'africano</p>
<p>This is a historical film depicting a fierce foreign war in ancient Rome. The sets and scenes in the film are unparalleled. The magnificence of the palaces and temples, the bloody battles on the battlefield, the charging of tens of millions of cavalry and infantry, the crushing of war teams, and the wonders of ancient wars vividly present the wars between the two nations of that era on the silver screen. From the point of view of film art, this film is a successful work. However, because there are no familiar and famous stars as a gimmick, and it is a film from Italy, and the entire dialogue is in Spanish,</p>
<p>Oriental - Border Flight</p>
<p>Border Flight</p>
<p>A small-budget film with a bland story. The aerial dogfights with bandits are quite exciting and moving. Frances Farmer and John Howard's performances are mediocre.</p>
<p>Dahua - The Sheik</p>
<p>The Sheik</p>
<p>Starring Rudolph Valentino, a very popular star in the silent film era, known as the Great Lover of the Silver Screen. Of course, it was a very satisfying film in that era.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Fu Shan's National Spirit <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>Quan Zuwang's "Biography of Mr. Yangqu" is abridged, and this work, rich in national consciousness, is worthy of our reference. Indeed, Quan Zuwang was a nationalist writer. Composing such nationalist literature was a manifestation of his own personality, which was rich in nationalist thought. Taking advantage of Fu Shan's deeds—at the time, Ma Shiqi's biography of Fu Shan already existed—Quan Zu once again began to write a biography of Fu Shan, which was truly a glorification of the national spirit. But here, based on what Quan Zuwang wrote, we must say that it is Fu Shan's national spirit.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Ming dynasty loyalists, the Manchus were foreign invaders. Those who helped foreign tribes collude with compatriots were traitors and slaves themselves. Fu Shan refused to be a traitor and did not want to be a slave, and he never cooperated with the Qing dynasty. When the Manchus entered the customs, he went into seclusion in the mountains to support his mother. Not only did he not seek glory by flattering foreigners, but no matter what, all attempts to win him over were ineffective. He was utterly rude to foreigners and unwilling to be perfunctory in the slightest. In the seventeenth year of the Kangxi era, the so-called Learned Men of Broad Erudition Examination was opened. "North of the Yellow River, none could peer into its secrets." Fu Shan's learning was good enough, and his reputation was great enough, so Li Zongkong and Liu Peixian both recommended him. Among ordinary scholars, this was considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, something to be sought after; but Fu Shan was unwilling to go. He couldn't simply refuse; the Qing government insisted that he go, so he feigned illness, and they carried him on a bed. When he reached a place thirty miles from the capital, he resisted with death and refused to enter the city. They stopped, and then officials of all ranks rushed to see him. He ignored them all, only pretending to be sick and lying in bed, regarding those who called themselves lovers of virtue as if they were invisible. Originally, those who worked under foreigners, whether high officials or big running dogs, were also big traitors and big slaves; small officials were small running dogs, and therefore small traitors and small slaves. Of course, those who understood could not bear to see this.</p>
<p>Among that crowd of shameless scoundrels, there was a Feng Pu who voluntarily went to the Qing government to speak well for Fu Shan, saying that Fu Shan would be given an official position without taking the examination. After the agreement was reached, he insisted that Fu Shan thank him, and he repeatedly urged him. Fu Shan resolutely refused, so they carried him away again. When they arrived at the palace, they forcibly raised him up to make him perform a ceremony, but he simply prostrated himself on the ground, never compromising in the slightest.</p>
<p>When Fu Shan was in seclusion in the mountains, people who admired him asked for his teachings. He said, "I study Zhuang and Lie, and I am ashamed to speak of current affairs!"</p>
<p>Zhuang and Lie were both recluses because they were indignant at the world. Fu Shan's statement shows his non-cooperation with foreign invaders. Someone also asked him who was the best among the scholars of the Song dynasty. His reply was, "I choose Tongfu." This is because Tongfu advocated resistance and the recovery of lost territory.</p>
<p>There was a loyalist named Zhang Ji who, because he refused to compromise with foreigners, excessively indulged in wine and women, gradually committing chronic suicide. After his death, Fu Shan went to hold his body and weep bitterly, saying that his death had the same significance as dying on the battlefield. This was, of course, an expression of indignation at the many who flattered foreigners at the time, and it also shows that Fu Shan held this Zhang in such high regard; that is, towards foreigners, one must at least adopt a policy of non-cooperation!</p>

<p>— Nguyen Dac Thuan of Vietnam</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of China's war of resistance against Japan, all of our Vietnamese compatriots have been paying close attention to the daily developments of the situation.</p>
<p>The cruel sounds of cannons and bombs have injured so many valiant soldiers defending their country and innocent civilians, causing us to shed many tears of sympathy!</p>
<p>Our scholars and intellectuals feel regret and indignation at the destruction of those ancient cities and historical sites that represent the essence of our Eastern civilization by the invaders' artillery fire. Our ordinary people, seeing in newspapers and magazines the countless innocent civilians who have been bombed in undefended cities and villages by the invaders, resulting in flesh and blood flying everywhere and suffering cruel sacrifices, feel grief and sigh, and deeply hate the inhumanity of the invaders. But sometimes we hear of China winning battles, whether big or small, and the masses feel infinite joy. This profound emotion is not a superficial, artificial display of goodwill; it is truly based on the inherent conscience of mankind, sympathizing with the weak who are unfortunately being slaughtered by the strong. It can also be said to be an expression of the justice and reason of maintaining human survival.</p>
<p>Because we have this precious sympathy, our Vietnamese compatriots are enthusiastic about all kinds of movements to aid China, and we are working even harder for fundraising to relieve refugees.</p>
<p>From December 1st to 4th, our Vietnamese compatriots held a four-day carnival in front of Albert Sarraut High School in Hanoi to raise funds to relieve Chinese refugees. Everyone participated enthusiastically, expressing our sympathy for the Chinese refugees, and also fully demonstrating that our compatriots have not forgotten the strong invasion that China suffered last year, during a time of national crisis. We are also trying our best to raise funds to repay the kindness of our great flood relief, and we must repay the goodwill of our neighboring country that helped us!</p>
<p>We often complain that those democratic countries that advocate peace are so weak and heartless that they sit idly by, allowing brutal invaders to commit robbery, arson, and murder in broad daylight! We only regret that we do not have the power to turn things around; otherwise, we would not allow such a cruel and inhumane act to exist!</p>
<p>But what we can do at present is that every compatriot should open his own pocket, donate more money, and save one more refugee from our neighboring country! Although this cannot immediately change the situation, at least we can fulfill one ten-thousandth of our human obligation to help each other in times of trouble, and we can also console the Chinese people who are in deep water, proving that only a few are brutal, and that most people sympathize with them and are doing everything they can to help them. This is the path we should continue to strive for in the future, and we hope that our compatriots will, in the spirit of human mutual aid in times of trouble, bravely advance and fight for humanity and for justice, and overthrow this common enemy of peace-loving people in the world—</p>

<h3 id="e62">The Rushing Fuchun River Water <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zong</p>
<p>It was a frigid winter morning last year.</p>
<p>The weather was frighteningly cold, and snowflakes like flying cotton were fluttering in the gray and dim sky, as if they would never stop. Patches of floating clouds were constantly spinning, seemingly looking for a place to hide.</p>
<p>Everything on the earth was immersed in the atmosphere of severe winter. Apart from the desolate cold wind, the mournful sound of falling leaves, and the distant rumbling cannon fire, no other sounds could be heard.</p>
<p>Beneath this dim and silent sky, towering and continuous mountain peaks surrounded a vast expanse of farmland. The rushing river water flowed endlessly through it. Slender, sharp peaks, dilapidated ancient temples, wide valleys, and fertile rice fields formed a paradise of countryside, which is where my beautiful hometown, Fuyang Tingtou, is located.</p>
<p>The fighting on the front line seemed unusually tense. The rumbling of artillery fire grew closer and closer in the bleak and desolate atmosphere. The sounds of heavy machine guns and hand grenades could also be heard clearly. Enemy planes, like locusts, swarmed in groups, circling over this paradise, and the terrifying situation seemed to have reached its most critical point. Vigorous men's corps and self-defense groups,</p>
<p>in lines, stepped on the white snow, braving the cold, and marched solemnly towards the outside of the village. On the face of each of them, there appeared the great and glorious mission they were bearing.</p>
<p>Although my father was old, he enthusiastically went to the front line early in the morning. Although my younger brother was still young, he refused to be outdone and followed the service corps cheerfully. "The father is a hero, the son is a brave man." Both father and son felt the peril of the nation and rushed to the national crisis.</p>
<p>After listening to my father's exhortations, I had no choice but to accompany my elderly mother, roll up our bedding, pack our belongings, leave my hometown where I had spent seventeen winters and summers, and hire a small boat to row on the river.</p>
<p>The boat moved forward in the rolling waves. The sound of cannons, the sound of the wind, and the sound of oars formed a desolate symphony. The boat was small and there were many people, so we constantly felt a kind of uncertain swaying. Looking at our home from afar, under the circling of enemy planes, it seemed to be bowing its head and sighing. After a few loud noises, it was covered in a cloud of black smoke. Then, I saw a layer of blazing fire, and I seemed to hear a few faint explosions. We immediately felt a burst of tension, and emotions of anger and hatred occupied our hearts even more intensely.</p>
<p>Ah! The thatched huts lined up in rows, the simple houses, the sparse vegetable gardens, and the dense fruit forests will ultimately not escape ××××××××.</p>
<p>In the rolling river waves, the small boat gradually drifted further and further away, and everything in my hometown finally became smaller and disappeared in the rumbling cannon fire and the black smoke.</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since my hometown was occupied. It is said that my father and younger brother are still struggling and fighting on the front lines. May God bless them to succeed. I think that one day, my lovely and beautiful hometown will welcome us back just as brightly.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Articles to the Front Line <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jianming</p>
<p>There is no need to hide the fact that our wartime cultural work, like politics, has not yet been able to catch up with the military. The slogan of "articles going to the countryside," which was proposed long ago, is still just a slogan today, and no one dares to say how far it has actually been implemented. I am not criticizing the cultural workers here, but only asking them to grasp the new political situation and quickly transition from slogans to practice.</p>
<p>Similarly, "articles to the front line" is not a new slogan, but according to an article published by Mr. Shen Junru in this newspaper on the tenth, "Not to mention the soldiers, even the generals often do not see a newspaper for a month and a half." As a result, the soldiers are not only spiritually disconnected from the rear, but they are also far less clear about the war they are fighting than we are in the rear. What is the situation of the war of resistance? They do not know. What is the political situation? They do not know. What is the international situation? They do not know even more. The most direct parties involved have become the most ignorant of the matter. No wonder Mr. Shen said, "We in the rear are really letting down the soldiers at the front."</p>
<p>Putting aside conscience, even in terms of intensifying political education for soldiers, we can no longer allow this phenomenon to continue. Can we rely entirely on oral political education for soldiers? Even if the workers are not afraid of trouble, the results will be very slow, and distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. The war will not allow you to proceed leisurely. Therefore, the written word should be placed first. It can run with the soldiers, it can increase the soldiers' knowledge in many ways, and it can answer the soldiers' questions in many ways. However, we lack this most powerful weapon.</p>
<p>In fact, the slogan itself does not need to be discussed. The important thing is how to implement it. In the past, there was a method of transporting books and newspapers to the front line, but "in fact, this is still empty talk, because those books and newspapers can only be sent to the adjutant's office, headquarters, and other places, and can never be sent to the hands of the soldiers on the front line." This is a fact that Mr. Shen saw with his own eyes on the front line. We cannot blame the adjutant's office or the headquarters for not sending the books and newspapers to the front line. We should review the work of those in charge of transporting books and newspapers and improve it, such as setting up close transfer stations. However, relying solely on the rear to transport books and newspapers to the front line is ultimately not enough and unreliable. It can only be used as a supplement to the soldiers' reading materials, and cannot be the main force. First, the types of newspapers are not varied; second, there are not enough copies to distribute; and third, the content cannot suit the tastes of the readers. Therefore, the best way is for cultural workers to take their pens to the front line to write articles, print them on the spot, use radio, simple printing presses, and even mimeographs. In this way, the soldiers can read fresh things, the quantity can be increased or decreased according to the number of people, and the writers, living with the soldiers, can use their language to answer their personal questions and answer the questions they urgently need to understand.</p>
<p>In the past, many cultural people have run to the front line, but if we want to remedy the current shortcomings and develop future work, on the one hand, we hope that those who are already on the front line will make redoubled efforts in this regard, and on the other hand, we must also call on the intellectuals and youth who are wandering in the rear to flock to the front line in large numbers. Since the defeatists have been purged, our politics has become clearer, and therefore the obstacles to our work have been reduced. We must not waste another minute of such a good opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Jottings of a March <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The quartermaster, who was in charge of the food, suddenly rushed over and shouted loudly,</p>
<p>"Collect the steamed buns!"</p>
<p>"How many does each person get?"</p>
<p>"Eight."</p>
<p>"They're so heavy."</p>
<p>"You'll find them useful when you're hungry."</p>
<p>Yes, last time we marched, we suffered a great loss because we didn't bring enough steamed buns! We walked for most of the day! We couldn't even get food, because there were no villages along the way where we could cook, and we couldn't buy snacks. We were so hungry that we just slept by the roadside and didn't want to walk. This time, we'd rather collect all the steamed buns and carry a little more on our backs than let our stomachs go hungry.</p>
<p>Many food bags were spread out, and many steamed buns were stuffed into them, and then, they were put on everyone's shoulders.</p>
<p>"Damn it, are we still going to go hungry on the road this time!"</p>
<p>The team set off and first walked a section of mountain trail, and then took the highway that runs through eastern Hubei, heading west to Linshan River.</p>
<p>The rice had already been harvested, and green seedlings had grown a foot high from the cut rice roots. Except for the flood-stricken areas, Hubei had a bumper harvest this year. The water flowed slowly in the fields, and children sat quietly fishing by the ponds.</p>
<p>When we reached the ancient tomb, we met Mr. Yu. We greeted each other warmly. The team had already passed. I immediately sat with him on the hillside and talked about the separation of ten days. It turned out that ten days ago, we four comrades who had been assigned to serve in the regimental headquarters became acquainted with Mr. Yu because of rest. He had originally planned to do small business in Nanjing, but because the capital was not safe, he fled back to his hometown with his family. We talked with him very agreeably, and he kept ordering his children:</p>
<p>"Go and add hot water." (To be continued)</p>
