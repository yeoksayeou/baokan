<p>社評</p>
<h3>加緊改善軍政問題</h3>
<p>全面抗戰由第一階段轉到第二階段，南北各戰塲都已出現我×相持的局面，×優我劣×進我退的情形已在激劇轉變，我們雖未達到完全停止×人進攻，然而確已部分地達到牽制×人進攻和打破×人進攻，並且在若干地方確已開始瓦解×軍收復失地的工作。尤其是配合着政治上全國團結的加强，持久抗戰的堅决，親日漢奸主和份子的墮落，和國際和平陣綫的積極進展，蘇聯美英援華運動的具體化，使這個轉變我×形勢的戰局更呈急激發展之勢。最近×人發動「太平洋上之九一八』的胃險挑釁，使中日戰事更具體地形成一種國際戰爭，形成兩條陣綫戰爭更緊張的局面，對於我國抗戰前途，自將發生非常重要的影響。我們應當趕快抓住這個時機，積極改善軍事政治黨務民運諸端，務使我們能够在這相持戰局中爭取更多的時間，實現一切新的軍政計劃，準備展開反攻的戰略，完成驅×出國收復失地建設新中國的偉大任務。</p>
<p>最高國防委員會成立伊始，近日卽開首次會議，而各戰區黨政委員會亦將先後成立。吾人深盼關係當局，鑒於目前抗戰局面與內外形勢，對於全部軍政，作更進一步之改善，積極展開全面戰局，促進×人於更大困難之境，以便揚前我國抗戰最後勝利的完成。茲特就吾人識見所及，謹献蒭議數端，藉供參攷，並望國人加以注意，共策進步。</p>
<p>最高國防委員會是目前我國抗戰建國的最高權力機關，委員諸公又多屬國民黨黨政軍各部負責當局，其爲全國以至全世界人士之殷切期望，自不待言。軍政百端，諸待改進，亦無庸贅述。特吾人積英勇抗戰二十個月的經騐與敎訓，深知戰事發展辛此，×人迄未放棄其「速戰速决」「以華制華」「分化中國」「反共停戰」的陰謀，也就因爲×國內外危機日益嚴重，非如此則其前途卽將不堪設想也。而我們所賴以力排萬難爭取最後勝利以拯救危亡者，唯一車要工作就是加緊全國團結，發展統一戰綫，持久抗戰到底。現在×人一面固然正在積極準備更大的胃險戰爭，一面却在繼續策動親日漢奸，假借「反共」「和平」之名，企圖離間我國內部團結，破壞我國全面抗戰，實現我國整個降服。而我國內少數頑固分子及無知之徒，繼續堅持失敗主義觀點及黨派系屬的成見，實際上做了日×漢奸的別動隊，同時外國統治者對侵略者的妥協政策，更便利了日×停止我抗戰的陰謀。因此，最高國防委員會應該確切依據國民黨臨全大會以至此次五中全會「團結全國堅持抗戰」的基本原則，一面迅速實現健全發展統一戰綫的妥善的組織形式，使全國抗日的各政黨，各民族，各階層和各界民衆的生動力量，得以迅速切實集中於統一領導之下，爲抗戰最後勝利建國最後成功而奮鬥。一面加緊掃蕩一切公開叛國的漢奸親日份子和僞組織，加緊肅淸潛伏的漢奸親日份子及其秘密組織與宣傳機關，加緊粉碎一切足以亡我國戚我族而危害世界的「反共」「和平」「國際調停」等陰謀活動。</p>
<p>黨政委員會，是目前各戰區統一處理軍事政治黨務民運工作的最高機關。是積英勇抗戰二十個經騐敎訓的光榮偉大的結晶。現在各戰區黨政委會先後成立，使人感到無限的欣慰與期待。我們願舉特別重要的兩點意見以爲負責當局施行或作參玫。首先各戰區軍事政治黨務民運諸端，固然急需統一領導與執行，而經濟工作，尤急求獲得適切的調整與統一的有計劃的推進，所以我們認爲黨政委會除了主持軍政黨務以外，還應該負責經濟工作。第一，凡關於戰區一切軍事黨務政治民運所需費用，均應由黨政委會負責支配，糾正過去一切流弊及困難。第二，實行政治動員，展開戰區經濟工作，一面破壞×人及漢奸的經濟刦掠，一面集中及發展適應適要的經濟力量。不過在這裏應該特別重視兩點，卽一方面要澈底肅淸官僚主義的傾向，澈底肅淸貪汚十劣封建殘餘勢力，另一方面要重用富於民族意識革命精神而在羣衆中有威信的靑年人材。</p>
<p>其次，我們雖然相信最後勝利有可能提前實現，但是我們不能有糊塗的樂觀。我們寧可設想到我們抗戰建國進程中，可能遇到更危險的陷阱與更嚴重的襲擊、寧可設想我們抗戰建國事業要經過非常悠遠而艱苦的鬥爭。因此，怎樣培育幹部，是當前極重大極緊急的問題。關係方面近曾傳出委任陳誠葉劍英負責組織幹部訓練學校的消息，雖然迄未獲得證實，但是時勢需要迫急至此，預想不久當有事實表現。這裏所想喚起關係當局及國人注意的，第一是這種軍事政治幹部訓練學校，不僅應該有一個全國性的大規模的組織成立，並且應該在抗戰建國綱領與統一領導之下，建立各戰區各部隊的訓練班。一方面滿足需要日增的前綫要求，一方面加緊樹立反攻驅×建設新中國的新領導層。</p>
<p>第二是三民主義靑年團向全國廣泛愛國靑年開門的要求，仍是今日的急迫要求。因爲只有使全國靑年參加民族統一戰線，並且英勇奮鬥，才能保證我們抗戰建國的最後成功。</p>

<h3>白崇禧講抗戰來的進步　續</h3>
<p>在滇擴大紀念週上</p>
<p>前進是安全　後退是死路</p>
<p>軍事方面，我們最高的戰略，是持久戰與全面戰，在戰略上，經十九月來抗戰的成績，我們勝利的基礎已經建立了，×人速戰速决的迷夢，已被我們粉碎，遭受重大的失敗。而我們是越來越多。越打越強。今後我們除了運動戰和游擊　之外，還要廣大的發動全面戰，這不分東西南北，都成戰塲，男女老幼，都參加抗戰，連文化敎育也要動員，目前的山西，即是一個實例，現在我報吿一點　海方面的情形，近來之廣　爛言，不說他們由北海登陸。就說他們已在東京　或圍洲島，建造了廣大的飛掛場。有許多人就害怕起來，以爲×任會打到雲南來。這我可以祖保，×人决沒有這樣的實力，沒有這樣的戰術。他由北海登陸到雲南來，還要經過廣西和貴陽，爲交通的梗阻，還有崇山與峻嶺，恐怕他要到廣西也困難，幷且現在北海南　的公路，經北們澈底的破壞，機械部隊和糧秣的輸送將萬分困難。兼之，廣西的民衆，已由靑年們領導普遍動員起來了。幷把握着政治重於軍事，游擊戰重於陣地戰的信條，正在切實準備，一軍民打成一片，切實合作，如果×人眞的冒險前進，那我們全民動員起來予以打擊，擴大了西南的戰區，爭取我們民族的光榮，這我幷不是不　家鄕，因爲××來侵略我們的土地，我們統率數十萬兵至萬　奔馳尋力着，天時地利都不適宜的長江一帶都要同它打，何况它送到我們犬時地利的門口來，雞道還不同它打嗎？（掌聲如雷）我們　不怕×人進攻南寗，柳州，如果它眞的要來嘗試，必定要使它蹈拿破崙進兵莫斯科的覆轍，大家不要天天想找安全地後退，須知前進即是安全，後退即是死路（鼓掌）總之，×人在十九個月來，占據了我們的土地，只是點和線，至於廣大的面積。還在我們手裏。抗戰前途，　爲樂　。</p>
<p>整個遠東問題　世界問題</p>
<p>在經　上我們　農業國家，所以×人雖然封鎖了我們海口。也沒有什麽關係，因爲我們的經濟力量，是在農村，而不在挪市。卽使我們的軍火運輸較前困難，但我們自己能　自造，尤其是我們的游擊戰和運動戰，軍火的消耗量很小，同時英美也給了我們很大的帮助，對日本將加以積極制裁的趨勢，將來恐　還有更多的與國。這是我們百萬將士浴血抗戰所得到的同情。）鼓掌）</p>
<p>外交方面，國聯在九國公約　無實力，但仍是一條援助路線，九國公約的重要，英美法都起來一致予以援助。尤其是英，美，法，蘇的和平民主陣線的一救援助，我們命該把握住的，我們要了解日本向中國侵略，是整個遠東的問題，也是世界的問題。只要將來美國陳兵於太平洋，俄國的大批飛機開到西比利亞和海參威，英法在印度洋有了準備。那時的日本××還不屈膝通？【轉入第四版】</p>

<h3>戰時行都的新聞業</h3>
<p>— 知我</p>
<p>【重慶特約航訊】武漢陷落以後，有着歷史　有廣大的讀者的幾家　聞紙，爲保存他們文字宣傳的抗戰力量，隨着重要機關而撤退。重慶是我們現在軍事，政治，經濟一切的抗戰建國復興民族的中心，同時也是我們暫時的行都。文化事業離不開民族力量集結的重鎭，因此武漢淪陷後各地的新聞紙，多陸續遷渝繼續出版。不但新聞紙遷來，各出版社，各雜誌社，也莫部搬進重慶，重新　起它們的抗戰宣傳責任。</p>
<p>重慶在昔約有人口廿餘萬，抗戰十八個月以來，各地遷來的人士漸多，截止最近已有了七十五萬人口的密度，也可以說除掉淪陷區各都山外，現在的重慶，已蔚成全國唯一的大都市了。抗戰以前這　是有新蜀報，國民公報，商務日報，濟川公報，大陸晚報等大小型新聞紙五六家。其中新蜀，國民，皆具有二三十年歷史，日刊三大張，銷數很不惡，在地方中，足　得起比較健全的新聞紙。去年春。上海時事新報，南京新民報，南京晚報先後遷來，同時行營也辦了一個西南日報，使這一個行都新聞界，激起了軒然的大波，各家雖均照中宣部所規定，縮減篇幅，改出一張，但營業上新聞競爭頗烈。新民報日刊四開報一張，短小精悍，編排新頴，頗能與大報頡頏而爭短長。銷路有一個時期且超出各大報，隱然是重慶中型報紙言論的重真。</p>
<p>去年十一月後，武漢長沙的大報撤退下來，先後在渝發刊的有大公，中央。新華，掃蕩，大江，武漢時報／新蜀報爲營業上的出路，於此時又辦了一種新蜀夜報。算到現在，重慶全市已有大報十一家，中型報二家。晚報三家。以七十五萬人口的都市剖除上分之七的文盲，只有不到卅萬的讀者的區域，而擁着大小晚三種報紙十六家，自可說是犯　消化不良的胃癌病了。因此有着信譽的大新聞紙，至多日銷不過一萬二三千份，普通的不過銷五六千份，最下的約是二三千份而已。</p>
<p>大致重慶的新聞紙，顯然的分出地方報，和外來報兩種。地方報自然要以新蜀國民公報爲好，外來報則大公，時事，中央，掃蕩，新　則無甚上下，其銷數較大的差別，也不過一二千份。時事新報因爲遷移早數月，根蒂略爲深些，所以它的銷路和廣吿，較爲好些。</p>
<p>除了大公而外，其餘皆自備印刷，不過因爲整所的房屋難找，後遷來的如中央，掃蕩，新華，莫不印刷工廠和編輯部分在二三處設立，中央日報的編料部設立在都城街，擠在一家雜貨店樓上一，同院有彈子房，昇平書茶社，還有其他……總而言之，環境是解鑼鼓喧囂的所在，編輯推　一望，眞的可以『目迷五色，笙管嗷嘈』。大公報的機噐由武漢退却時，句船裝運，到現在還沒運來，有人問王芸生君，王君道：『運是運來了，什麼時節運到，那只有上帝曉得』。</p>
<p>這地方因爲交通關係，報紙油墨等印刷材料，極度缺乏，白報紙無論捲筒平板皆無購處，掃蕩，大公，時事，新蜀，新民，國民，大江，是用着舊存的紙，那是半年以前設法運來的，恐怕不久都將用罄。新華，中央，西南，濟川，商務等家，一個月前已改用土紙了。四川出產土紙遠在十數年前，而報紙的採用，也有過十餘年歷史。最初出產的土紙，祗有平板一種，而且糟軟不耐用，抗戰以來求過於供，紙廠因營業的發達，特別加上力量，精益求精，大量的製造，到至現在，產量已晋最高峯，幷且有捲筒紙造出，紙張韌性很人，所差的原料和技術關係，不能由草紙的黄色，而變爲西洋報紙的白色，絞比江西的國產報紙還遜一籌。當地人叫這種紙爲『嘉樂紙』，</p>
<p>在四川合川，永川，璧山，榮昌幾縣專有五六家工廠造「嘉樂紙」，唯造捲筒紙的工廠，只有永川一家。中央，新華，都使用「嘉樂捲筒紙一，此種捲筒紙不論磅，祗論領，每領要　到廿四元。平板的「嘉樂紙」每領要賣十八元。還有種種次色的貨，則賣十六元，十四元。工廠任是晝夜開工不停生產，還是求過於供。有人顧慮到五個月後，其他各家報館，存紙用完，勢必也得改用士紙，恐怕紙價的飛漲猶其餘事，發生紙荒，必不能免。</p>
<p>經濟部目前極力獎助內地絨廠的遷來，或當地倒閉的紙廠復興，以爲救濟紙荒之道，聽說已有人在籌備投鉅資設一大廠的制造，但『遠水不解近渴』，迫在最近的困雞，恐怕仍是無法解决的。</p>
<p>隨着武漢淪陷退到重慶的出版業，大部份是已經繼續的設立起來。但紙料旣恐慌，印刷復困難，各家原在漢口特約的印刷廠，皆是　部開工，不能承應大批的印刷，所以影響到各出版，業非常凄凉。生活，大東，天馬，新知數家六幾個月沒有一本新書問世，所賣的還是那武漢退來的老貨。</p>
<p>雜誌，週刊，半月刊，月刊，抗戰　歌，文藝政論，軍慶當地原出版的，詩漢及各地退下來的，共總有七十多家，各家苦幹的精神，仍如以前，祗係交通不便，外地銷路滯塞，且紙張油墨過　，成本太貴，均不敢多印刷。其間像「中國的空軍」，「文摘』，「全民抗戰」，「國訊」銷路最好，然多者不過一萬份，少則三四千份，「國訊」等廿餘家，用不起白報紙，已改用土紙了。</p>
<p>行都的新聞紙雜誌雖似如此的多，經營的前途如此的困難，但精神均好，大家鄱知道它的使命，而堅苦的奮鬥；這在抗戰全局的後防，建起了精神給養的兵站，於最後勝利獲取途上，已是貢献了他們應盡的責任了。（六日　慶）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>抗議的後盾</h3>
<p>日×侵攻海南島，實際上巳把侵華戰事擴大爲爭覇太平洋的大戰·英法美各國巳在嚴重的威脅之上、因此英法美各國對日抗議，是必然之舉，昨天英國已繼法國而抗議日×侵佔海南島了。</p>
<p>不過口頭的紙面的抗議，必須有雄厚的實力爲後盾，才有收到效果的可能。現在和平國家向侵略者抗議的後盾是甚麽呢？我們看到了昨天英首相發表經與法政府會商共保遠東權益的談話，我們還看到了美國海軍人演習的事實。是的，只有和平國家的團結合作，只有　事力量的示威，才是一切抗議最有力的後盾。不過還有我們未曾認淸的力量，第一是蘇聯和平政策的力量，第二是國際勞動大衆在英美法在日德意進行中的反法西斯反侵略鬥爭的力量。我們必須組織並統一這些力量，配合我國和西班牙的反侵略求解放的鬥爭，才能成爲向法西斯侵略者抗議的後盾。</p>
<h3>春節到了</h3>
<p>春節到了，或是直截了當的說是舊曆年節到了！</p>
<p>按照我國民間習慣，老百姓們平常日夜辛勤，到了新年時節，便借着祭神敬天的禮儀，大家狂歡一下，從人情上講，實在不可　非，而且還可舉出許多値得贊許的理由！</p>
<p>不過我們試一思考，在這樣一個不合理的社會裏，到了新年時節，眞正狂歡的，那裏輪得到那些平常日夜辛勤的人們？還不是給繁重的經濟枷鎖壓迫着連氣也透不過來？如果再想到我們正在×人砲火轟炸下的祖國，想到我們正在×奸刦掠壓迫與殺害之下的田園廬舍父老姊妹，我們眞要懷疑：新年究竟是什麻人的？春節究竟是什麽人的？</p>
<p>寄生在特殊區域裏的有錢人，不要讓自己在震天的炮竹聲鑼鼓聲嬉笑聲中忘了形吧！爲了保陣永遠的自由安全與幸福，每一個人都應該節省一些消費，來献給我們祖國，來××我們前綫將士，來救濟我們各地難民，祖國，將士，難民們高舉着熱情的手向着你，不要失去你光榮献禮的機會！</p>

<h3>白崇禧講抗戰來進步　（接第三版）</h3>
<p>掃除文化漢奸</p>
<p>在文化方面，我們應努九增强民衆抗戰意識，這是文化人的重要任務。但有一種文化人，是民族失敗主義者，我們要　防，他的專門危　聲聽，散播種種搖動人心的謬　。這種失敗主義者的謬論，比之有形的漢奸，爲　更大，這種人我稱之爲「文化漢奸」。我們要把他掃除（鼓掌），才足以樹立起我們全民抗戰的信念。</p>
<p>最後，附帶報吿汪精　先生出走的經過，在這點，我要特別申明，我不是攻擊個人，我是爲國家民族　想，本來汪先生是國民黨的老前輩，與我個人的私交，是很好的。但他求和出走的事實昭然，我不能不把他報吿出來，使大家有一個了解；汪光生此次求和出走，是他主和的一貫政策，南京失陷後，他就主和，武漢失陷，又再求和。這次廣州失陷，他更積極求和。當他朱出走之先，曾在重慶紀念週上報吿：他說：中國現在非主和不可，今天我來講這話，就是誰拿槍來打我三槍乃至於三十槍，我還是要講和，這是在渝的人，都知道他說這話的！有一次他　我去謁委員長。也是談到和的話，問我的意思怎樣，我說：我是一個軍人，是以服從爲天職，我不知道和與不和，最高統帥叫我怎樣我就怎樣，這我是服從抗戰的國策。我在歷史上自來沒有見過因抗戰而滅亡的國家，但如陶希聖之流，他是讀歷史讀雜了，所以才有了現在的行爲。汪先生呢！他是個害着親日病的人，每見前線打勝戰一，他懊惱，見前線打敗戰，反而高興，他在重慶時候，曾提過求和的五個條件。最近發出的豔電，是同×酋近衞有了相當聯絡，總之，汪先生不是一個大政治家的風度。假使是一個大政治家的話，那如英國的艾登與張伯倫的政見不和，則坦白的辭退，站在旁觀地位，不妨礙他人。我們此次抗戰，是旣定的國策，是全民的主張，並且也是爲和平而抗戰，伹×人關鎖了和平的大門。怎能　他　和呢，兼之，和平是要平才能講和，不平之鳴，怎能和得下來呢？更不能由　人單獨行動，隨便講和。目前除了漢奸，還有誰不愿意抗戰圖存呢？（鼓掌）因之，汪先生出走之後，倒使重慶的親日　調分子根　了。（木林）</p>
<h3>歐洲的新危機</h3>
<p>— 董平譯</p>
<p>Polftfcus原著。改譯自『莫斯科新聞』</p>
<p>在倫敦，成羣結隊的學生，擎着一吾人要求美國援助」的標語，在　街小巷中亂　；在蒙烏特法國羣衆眼瞪着維蘇維火山在嚷口號；同樣地，羅馬的議員，法西斯的祁紙及莫索里尼的嘍囉們，也在大　「科西嘉」「尼斯」「突尼斯」及「吉波的』的要求：其實，這類玩意都是一樣的，根本無理取閙。</p>
<p>不幸的是，在這個世界上，民主國家們竟不能守住一個堅定的政策和力　，於是乎，法西期的凶燄，便愈來愈烈；而莫索里尼的要求也便成了了不起的大事。當然，誰都不曾忘記，去年希特勒不是無原無故的要求合倂奧大利嗎？結果他　去了。還有不久以則的捷克，不也是在慕尼黑輕輕地送過去的嗎？不論自歷史，民族或法律那方面看，那一件是有理的。</p>
<p>也許有人想：如果突尼斯當年根本不曾屬於意大利，如果科西嘉老早便賣給了法國；如果尼斯在一八六〇年時，經過公民投票之後，意皇愛麥虞限一世便慷慨的割給了法國的話，現在該不曾生出岔兒來了。但，這會嗎？法西斯侵略者對她自己的路言都一味圖賴，她還會信守她祖宗簽訂的條約嗎？自然她更不會顧到那些土地上的民意了。她的一切行動永遠是取決於兩個文題：『我們須要它嗎？』『我們能够把它弄到手嗎？』</p>
<p>也許誰要問，意大利眞想把這　地方自法國弄到手嗎？爲什麽不呢？她如果能統治了尼斯，科西嘉及突尼斯，那她便完全控制了地中海的西部，使她的本部與遙遠的沙地尼亞和潘特萊里的海軍據點取得密切的聯繫。</p>
<p>同樺的，莫索里尼復不顧他在一九三五年與賴伐爾簽訂的協定——在那協定中，法國同意把杜米亞還給意大利，但以　國不再提出其他要求爲條件——而又提出取囘索馬利蘭及吉波的的要求。如果意國眞的弄着了這兩　地方，英國在非洲亞達的防禦力便馬上會降到等於零。在現在，亞達算是英國船隻赴印度和法國船隻去安南的重要據點。</p>
<p>意大利能够把它弄到手嗎？這個問題的答案，又是正面的。最近的史實便是明證。而且還遺下着最好的法門讓法西斯侵略者去採用。那法門是：「不問你要多少，你用戰爭的恐嚇去要挾好了，你總婦能够自張伯倫和達拉第那兒滿載而歸的。卽令他們知道法西斯意大利的力量，比納粹德意志差得遠，但他們仍然食不惜委屈求全，以化干戈爲玉帛的。所以，予取予求吧！「</p>
<p>於是，在德國的支持之下，意大利嚷出了她的要求了，要求法國殖民地和她本部的分割。在慕尼黑會議之後，達拉第正意得志滿的以爲建立了歐州的和平，頃刻之間，沒料到不久以前跟他「相談甚歡」的莫索里尼却來跟他找麻煩。焦頭爛額之餘，自然又得求援於英國。這一次，英國的態度却令人難測了。帮助「傳統的友人」呢？還是像在慕尼黑賜予德國的一般，也來給意大利一臂之助？</p>
<p>張伯倫先生在羅馬沒逗留到四十八小時，便悄然返英了——譯者）</p>
<p>張伯倫在羅馬跟莫索里尼怎樣「培養一和平，我們無法推測，而且那也是不必要的。他也許採取「合作」方法，把吉波的和自吉波的通阿狄士阿巴巴的鐵道權送給意大利。他也許主張改善突尼斯意人的待遇。他也許建議帮意大利的忙，在蘇彝士運河上爭一份行　權。他也許還有別的許多許多方法。自然，張伯倫在羅馬是會大講「斤頭」的，因爲至少他總知道，少讓意大利佔點上風，不但是法國之幸，也是大英帝國之幸。但無疑的，張伯倫仍然是心甘情願的來談這個交易。當一個人不乾脆地說「不」而說，「好吧，我們商量商量』：那麽事情便有幾分眉目了。所以，這次莫索里尼大約能自張伯倫手中拿到點玩意的，除非莫索里尼的樓氣太大，</p>
<p>自然，莫索里尼的諾言原等於零。但張伯倫却曾在英國議會聲明，非至西班牙志願軍撤退之後，英意協定决不付諸實施。但現在呢？在表面上，意大利是撤退了九千名志願軍—可是，却也換來了更多更强的大批生力軍，正趕上了加泰隆前線的大進攻，爲佛朋　建了一功。</p>
<p>這事實，自然也令張伯倫有點不快，那是很微細的。許多人謠傳着，英國也跟德意一樣的在希望西班牙政府早日潰崩，這也許不是完全無因的。最近英國巳經在醞釀承認叛軍爲交戰團體（現在巳在醞釀合法承認佛朗哥政府了——</p>
<p>法國的處境當然異常困難，莫索里尼的要求只要實現十分之一，法國所受的打擊，就比她失去捷克的屛障時多上十倍。所以他現在堅决地宣稱：决不放棄寸土尺地。但願她能守此信念永遠不渝。</p>
<p>現在的一切，似乎還在彤雲密條的時期，伹無疑地，暴風雨就快降臨了。新的歐洲危機就在眼前。到那時我們且看：意大利又用怎樣的方式來侵略？法國將用如何的手段去抵禦？幷且，誰又知道，這是不是第二次大戰的導火線！</p>

<h3>香港兒童保育院</h3>
<p>去年九月九日的夜晚，九龍車站來到了由漢口出發的二百四十五名難童，因此籌備了相當的時日的，中國戰時兒童保育會，香港分會的兒童保育院，立即充實起來，由於港地人口日增，尋找適合的院址，這是困難，幸虧院長何艾齡博士，各方奔忙，得到當地政府及各團體的援助，借得國家醫院暫用。這批從炮彈逃出，又經過長途跋涉的孩子們，總算有了歸宿。</p>
<p>爲丁完成戰時兒童保育的宗旨，馬上舉行甄別試騐，嚴格地分了七班，計初中一班，高初小共六班。每天上午六時起身，然後早操，早飱，　會，九時至上二時上課，下午一時至三時上課及勞作。下午六時以前的時間，爲學生洗衣洗澡，及課外活動。晚飯後有一小時自習，九點鐘　燈睡覺。每日三餐，均爲會食，各隊長分菜，每人一份，食堂秩序由敎職員輪流監護。　作內容計巳開班的有籐工，木工，製肥皂，及女生縫紉，幼童下午則由敎師率領唱遊及習字自修，最近於晚上睡覺前，又加開一班敎廣東話，因此輩兒童皆爲外省人。兒童欲食三餐外，每星期三加食牛肉粥，星期一五飲牛奶，星期二四下午喝凉茶，星期日分食水菓。還有一批從廣州收來的八十餘名幼童及孤兒，另在元朗第一分院收養，他們的年齡平均幼小，但也過着小組分隊的生活。其中八個大些的組織一服務團，照顧他們幼小的弟妹。元朗地址在鄉村，環境優美，對於兒童發育，非常適台，只要天氣許可，都在戶外上課。在朝會時，各班由級任作時事報吿，課程內容，也在儘量採用適應抗戰的材料。每個星期六晚，舉行同樂會，救亡話劇，抗戰歌曲，佔去了所有的節目。簡陋的演出設備，却會收到良好的效果；緊張嚴肅的會場精神，這說明了大家的心情，在關懷着什末！</p>
<p>生病的兒童，每日由來院的醫生診査，重者送入病院，免費治療，輕者留本院病室療養。爲了　劑生活，鍛練體格，每兩星期，全體作一次短足旅行；幷時常去參觀學校及工業團體，以作生活敎育的參攷。</p>
<p>該院工作人員，除正院長及教務主任爲純粹義務外，其餘副院長及敎職員十七位，都是半盡義務的工作者，每月只領到最低的車費。敎員當中多半是敎育部派港的國語推行員，還有三位是戰時兒童保育總會派出護送兒童來港的先生。職員八人，分別担任敎務，訓育，醫務，庶務，事務等事宜。級任敎員七人，科任敎員二人，除一二門功課由科任担任外，其餘課程均由級任負責，孩子間的問題亦都歸級任先生們負責。級任先生們兼作保姆，這是保育院工作的特徵！學生們的課外組織，巳有自治會話劇團，歌詠隊，小竄樂隊，均由敎師們負責指導。該院經費，</p>
<p>最近，她們又得香港政府撥出舊國家　院的留產室，爲第三保育院，巳開始收容各　院，現有的嬰孩，和元朗分院拾獲的難嬰，合約五十餘名，該院經費，係各界人士熱心捐助支持，未受總會及政府津貼，但很明顯地缺少基金，一切計劃工作都難開展，目前感到困難問題很多，如院址的籌建，敎育用品的缺乏等，都需要各界熱心帮助解决，爲了人類的正義，國家的生存，民族的解放，各界人士尤其是祖國同胞，應以絕大的精力，用在帮忙他們計劃，並實行保育工作上，在這曾經是一羣流浪兒當中，我們深信有着文化上無限的寶藏的</p>

<h3>年宵市場動態</h3>
<p>— 郁瑯</p>
<p>香港人是富於保守思想的，許多陳舊的，針建殘餘的事物，在國内已經廢除干凈，在香港還隨地可見；政府頒行行歷已經許多年了，但是，廢歷新年在香港仍然年年今日，歲歲今朝，鋪燈結彩，慶祝不衰。</p>
<p>什麽『臘鼓冬冬』，『歲聿云暮』，廢歷新年又快到了，算來祗有四日。所以人家都忙着一辦年貨」，準　過新年。一年一度的年宵市場，昨日巳開始，地　香港　在灣　高士打道，由分域道口至動寧道口一段，九龍方面由窩打老道，亞皆　街，南昌街，直至彌教道海傍一段，又由深圳街，砵崙街，大南街直至長沙灣道一段。</p>
<p>灣　的年宵市場有一百方尺的灘位，共四百九十六號，九龍方面有攤位一共也有三百多號，這種攤位都是用竹搭成的，據搭棚匠們說因爲×人的侵略，西江河道不通，竹，蔑，杉　，搭棚用村，供給都很困難，所以搭攤位要比往年貴，往年搭無蓋的攤位祗需三西元，今年却要五六元，有蓋的攤位往年要七八元，今年要十多元。</p>
<p>在往年來說，年宵市塲上佔了大位地的是花市，今年花市却　常冷落因爲華中和廣州淪陷後，花的夾源巳吿斷絕；杜鵑吊鐘的含有一利市一意味的花都告渴市，一般人認爲富　的牡丹花，更找一盤也沒有，唉！大好江南，××××××××，那裏來牡丹花呢？想起牡丹花，眞令人切齒！</p>
<p>今年花市，據一般花販說：祇有靠些芍藥，菊，和洋花——劍蘭，竹節。豆花……來支撑，：吊鐘因爲內地來源斷了，本港山頭的吊鐘，是禁止採伐的、所以祗有私家花園出產的小數。他們雖然不大茂盛，但是『物罕爲奇』。疏疏的一枝吊鐘花，價難也很驚人、他們索價惟往都要二三，塊錢，桃花，梅花，價錢也不弱。　往　　　水仙水，今年也「高市」起來，稍爲好一些的，便要三四塊錢一「頭」。</p>
<p>舊字畫　古玩今年比往年多了一倍以上，大約因爲戰　影嚮，內地的存貨都盡量流到香港吧（？）據個中人說，今年到舊字畫攤去，可以找得一兩件「珍品」。</p>
<p>令人看了興奮的是國產兒童玩品，往年推滿年宵市塲的多是紅紅綠綠的東洋洋娃姓，日本「化學公仔」，今年却不同了，許多國產的小型飛機，戰艦，槍，炮，……代替了「化學公」的地位。汕頭抽紗製品，福州漆噐，石灣倣古瓦器等國產貨品都站着重要的地位。</p>
<p>年宵節約運動的呼聲正高，讓我補充一句，節約是減省幷不是絕對不買，在節約的情形下，我們買物時，要能够祗　國貨便好了。</p>
<h3>國際同情我失學青年　世佛羅里達學生聯盟秘書　特林奉派來華視察救濟　特林女士業已抵港昨日首途赴渝　歐美救濟學生募款已達十萬美元</h3>

<h3>菲埠際足球隊　一行人馬昨抵港　港埠際隊今日與港聨隊作練習賽</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】籌備多時、又是破題兒第一遭之港菲埠際足球賽、在萬千迷民熱望中、巳屆實　之期、本週末午後三時半、兩路大車、使止式接觸於海軍球塲矣、</p>
<p>菲軍一行人馬、由卡爾佛氏率領、趁　萊號輪船、於昨晨抵港、下　思豪酒店、至午後全體驅車到加山南華球塲、小試脚頭、</p>
<p>記者在加山得晤卡氏、　談、『我方之足球運動、歷史尙淺、巳往亦甚少派隊出外比賽、尋求技術上之進益、反之、港方球隊如、華等、在最近十年來、幾乎年必一次蒞臨我方、不吝指敎、使我方足球技術水準、漸自提高、故我方足球界、不啻視港方球隊爲一恩師也、今次蒙香港足球總會之邀、到港作中際賽、但我隊是屬後輩、初臨貴境、至希港中人士、莫嫌我隊技術拙劣、应予南針、是爲厚幸、此次來港球　、共十五人、惟有二位正選、臨時未暇前來、乃另選二員補上、在航程中、風浪頗大、均感不適、　云云</p>
<p>又據卡氏稱、本週末（十九日）之埠際养、該隊上陣人物、大致如下、</p>
<p>堯俄（喇沙書院）　巴戚高（烈他蘭會）　W米蘭打（喇沙書院）</p>
<p>臬都（YCO會）　姚吉地（喇沙書院）　華理斯（喇沙書院）</p>
<p>必治（YCO會）　鮑養利（YCO會）　喇拉沙卑路（隊長喇沙書院）　希烈打（喇沙書院）　利他斯（喇沙書院）</p>
<p>後備　那飛路　香那地斯　嘉巴拉士　章蘭奴華</p>
<p>港埠際隊、於今日下午五時、在海軍球塲冉作練習賽、由港聯隊與之周旋、門票一律二角、港聯陣線、昨再行决定、故與昨報刊出者略有不同、照錄兩陣如下、（東郞）</p>

<h3>歡迎菲律賓球友　（續）</h3>
<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>近幾年來、他們力求深造、不斷地向上　進、學校中也較前加倍重視、使得滬上名將『　賽利』南下、親自提導、啓迪後起、遂有長足的展進、成績　度驚人、去年在港加戰　勝的哥　登隊、在非也吻度　羽、東方會　埃路士打陸軍　後南下　聘、也幾番受抨、　實力如何、太可推像得之、他們唯閔的優點是『高速度』、而盤運諸　、亦足媲美吾國其地守門將軍、因有籃球的、基本訓練、多　出　拔萃的良材、倘非具　異的　們術、不易攻破他們的最後關頭、最可惜的、菲方却沒有水準　足球裁判、客隊在菲賽球、多少總吃點虧，他的自家也知衆點所在、去歲會函　本港裁判會派員往菲指導、　釋犯規（港方卒無人應召）可見他們那探長截　的大慾、和虛心求敎的精神、都　得吾人欽許和　　的</p>
<p>總之、這　菲隊來港作戰、人强馬　、　非昔日央卜阿蒙、　人雖　以免待勞，也應　　看、不可心存輕視、　知他們多是初生之　不畏虎、我們　騐　藝縱使略佔便宜，但「高速率—是他們的宗旨目標、技術問題、在這類的Cup-Ｔie錦標賽中、必歸次要、我們如不鎭靜從事、沉着應有、恐怕在偶爾疏怱中、會蹈着前年敗于滬隊的覆轍、我深信他們這回有相當的準　、有相當的對心、又經過了一番嚴格的訓練、一定會有　妙的表演、以飽飫港人的眼福、其攻守進退的不同、戰略也必有以一新迷胞的脾胃、寄語那一向抱持着士君了風度的球國大衆、請你們以欣賞者的立　、以嘉善矜不能的主義、準備着歡迎的掌聲、靜候着連檯好戲的開塲罷、</p>
<p>在擱筆前、我願以一瓣心香、敬祝那從菲律賓惠　的新舊球友、一賓至如歸、旅次多福一、（完）</p>
<h3>顧后瞻前</h3>
<p>— 賴端甫</p>
<p>此次上海大學生網球隊秉其大無畏之精神、來與技衛蒸蒸日上之香港先進相切磋，竟　有二勝三敗之成績表　上似屬難得、但我望　隊諸君、幸無因此自滿、因彼　所勝者爲港中不甚有名於網球界之大事堂與西洋會而已、照實際論、其隊中諸　、吾只能　李國潘之球藝爲佳、書包嘉貝長於氣力、手法脚法、尙須加以改善、共餘三子，則均在幼稚時期、能　練數年、始有出頭希望、聞諸子今日正午乘法國郵船社美總統囘滬、我呈歸後冉下苦功、我在此特下個敬送禮、</p>
<p>嘉在滬　勝李國璠、我以爲、此或係李賽取穩健、只作底線抽擊之韌性　法、而未研究單打上網法、是以吃不消唐氏大刀闊斧之壓擊故然、我批評球藝、素主愼重、故少錯誤、觀於唐氏之手法脚法、猶須有改善之必要、自　能與李氏今茲之球藝同日而　、若李氏今後悉心硏究上網法而仍不能勝唐氏者、吾敢决其必無此是理、</p>
<p>星期六日南華南終以二對一勝項旅九　會而、準决賽圈、　令國產球迷欣悅、其前之所以未勝而三戰終勝、自是第三次創　盡起之故、但我以爲焦點似不如是簡單、第一原因是馮景祥突有衝剌力與維斗文之能略改「多盤少傳」弊　，其次則能及時起用人無畏之張榮材守門、這番調　得法、莫軍師有莫大之功、今後如遇善衝刺之頑旅、張榮才爲一不可少之一人、</p>
<p>警察會之僅勝無比路度上陣之聖約瑟而獲特別銀牌甲組足球决警權、可謂僥倖之極、其所以勝、功不在西員而在陳范黃三華將、在我之觀察、范貴才賽時如能注全神於賽球、則以有此身材、又有此　法、他日必成名將、黄文之右　演出、亦是可造才、陳光裕則微嫌腰硬、轉身不　、否則亦是上上人物、他日與華隊决賽、此三子如能悉從球藝上做　夫、必能獲同胞之敬仰、</p>
<p>前星期四日之　選隊對港聯隊足球練習賽、選隊演來大失人　、阜拉絕非右翼才、以較突飛孟晉之鄧廣森　色　甚、吿山奴當左内鋒、顯然不慣、於漢與韓尼維路　不見好、施漢遠　　侯榕生、韓尼維路且輸小史杜蘭治、李天生與梁榮照、硬被易位、亦演不出本色、以此而戰遠來之强旅、我爲憂心、　喜菲隊亦不見得甚强或者各本個人球藝，仍有得勝希望、我仍以爲今之最强香港選隊應如下列、</p>
<p>譚均幹（南華）</p>
<p>李天生（南華南）　紐備（海軍隊）</p>
<p>比路度（聖約瑟）　許　成（東方會）　梁榮照（南華南）</p>
<p>侯澄滔（东方會）　馮員祥（南華南）　李惠堂（南華南）　告山奴（聖約瑟）　岩士道郎（　軍隊）</p>
<p>昨日菲律濱選隊巳到、我曾在加路連山親見彼　練習、　隊員多身段不高、脚頭也不甚勁、此或是舟車勞頓後之現　、然而我自　眼力不弱、若果照比人物、除非有極好聨絡、方足勝人、港選隊人物雖錯亂配置、然而員員有老到球　、當仍有取勝希望華聯此隊與　聯隊、則極似有必勝把握、因華聯太好、港聯前　盡衝能員、故比選隊更有取勝把握也</p>
<p>今日港選隊本定與海陸軍聯隊作一次練習賽、但海陸車因有事不暇出隊、昨總會巳另選一港聯隊與戰、（名單見段）、也相當强勁、仍照原定于下午五時在海軍球場舉行、（並非如外傳或在星期五舉行）、入塲券一律二毫、菲隊則定于四時起在該　練習、如早購券入塲、當有雙料眼癮可過、</p>
<p>李滙堂在足球界稱天才、網球又抱相當球　、而且中英文均有深造、的是奇才、此爲人所盡知者、未見甚文奢但觀其歡迓菲隊文　、便不由　不拜服、惟是足球界還有一僩文武全文、尙爲人所不知者、也値得介紹、守門員譚均幹、英文也好、現當杳港義勇軍、習軍事識、於漢文也頗有造就、能寫北魏、作小詩亦此屬不凡，與惠堂共事於瑞典洋行、又有兩人同塲未　敗績之紀錄、堪稱足球界「二難」、</p>
<p>蓬勃有朝氣之東方會甲組足球隊、原本星期六與海軍隊比賽、東方乘戰勝南華南餘威、氣吞河嶽、大可連海軍亦掃敗、與南華南共向冠亞軍之途雙雙謀進取，可是海軍太機警、竟請改期、農曆　夕遂禾能見該齣好戲、但據最近秩序之改定、則該日東方改戰米杜息、米軍亦勁旅、也有看頭、不過米軍無奪標望、興緻不如戰海軍高、惟是上塲猶有一場士葛對　約瑟之甲組聯賽、準下午二時半關場、旣有　料着頭、球迷也宣踴躍　會、</p>
<p>菲隊此次係租船前來、同行者不少因看李惠堂與吿山奴而來之菲島球迷、現多寓菲隊駐　之　豪酒店、</p>
<h3>國際溜冰　芬蘭冠軍</h3>
<p>【海通社十四日沙高賽電】昨星期一日國際溜冰　軍四十公軍分隊接　賽、芬蘭本　仍穩握寶座銜、其隊員乃碧加能、阿拉哥爾柏、柯爾乾那拉、及加賽尼，　閒　二小時八分又卅五秒、第二名瑞典、三名意大利、四名那威、</p>
<h3>電影与戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……煩惱的愛神</p>
<p>Love　Is　A　Ｈadache</p>
<p>是好萊塢戀愛喜劇之濫觴、旣沒有情趣的故事、　員們也缺乏圓　的演作、各個情節之開展、顯見勉强而不自然、</p>
<p>片中描寫一個百老匯的紅伶、　着宣傳、勉强的收養了兩個頑皮不過的孩童、結果雖則兩孩童給她不少的煩惱、這是却使這過慣養尊處優生活的女伶、　會到一種母性的愛、同時描寫一一個遭對女伶非常愛慕、而却極端反對她那種官傳方法的報館編輯、在他們兩人之間所閙出的種種笑話、</p>
<p>法蘭却通、和基地絲佐治兩人雖很賣力、却未獲得美好的成績、　基郞尼在本片中的演作、雖沒像在法官哈地的家庭等片　那樣精彩、但還差强人意、</p>
<p>皇后……巨慶藏珍記</p>
<p>A　slight　Case　of　Murder</p>
<p>本片雖則則是以盜匪爲題村、但却充滿着詼諧的和情趣和諷剌的意味、故事描寫的雖是一班殺人不貶眼的魔王、而給與觀衆的印象、却不是恐怖緊張的刺激、而是輕鬆的喜劇趣　、</p>
<p>愛德華魯濱遜飾一改邪歸正的匪徒但他一向所經營的碑酒事業、因爲出品太壞、平素全靠一班囉囉們用了恐嚇的手段才能推銷、現在旣巳洗手不幹壞事、眼看有這生意大大的虧本、同時他的愛女和一富家兒戀愛、而女兒的條件是須待這男子有獨立的職業，行結婚、那公子哥不得巳暫當警察之職、因爲這是他唯一找到的職位、</p>
<p>幸運轉變了一切、適有另一班盜匪、因爭藏金的緣故、在愛德華　居互相殘殺、及到愛德華他們來到、意外的發兒滿屋屍首、和大量的金錢、而那位東床快婿警察先生、把死屍重行槍殺一番、幷在無意中槍殺匪魁、領得為社會除害的頭功、</p>
<p>愛德華魯濱遜在本片中的作風、雖則有　微的改變、　他的演技却仍　他以前演「社會暴徒」、「賊學博士」等片一樣老鍊精到、出神入在唯妙唯肖的表現出一　匪徒的性格，合演的演員、都是飾演匪徒的妙手、也皆有令人滿意的演作、</p>
<p>平安……國外迫仇記</p>
<p>Border　Law</p>
<p>全片以美國西部爲背景、描寫一段俠士殺賊復仇的故事、片雖不很長、可是有普牧童片所應有的優點、緊張的情節、活潑動作、加上魯比他拖華的西班牙式的淸歌曼　、熱情的　作、在緊張刺激的情　中、加添不少輕鬆的羅曼絲意味、　鐘士在本片中有高超的技　表演、在他所有的作品中、此部「城外追仇記」有較好的成績、</p>
<p>國泰……得意洋洋</p>
<p>Battle　of　Broadway</p>
<p>本片描寫兩條代表某鍊　廠釗紐約出會的硬漢、同時他們負着那廠主私人所託的任務、就是陂壞廠主兒子興一百老匯歌伶的變愛、料他們兩人也是好色之徒、竟一同瘋狂的迷戀另一歌女、繼之廠主也身踏護　、爭風吃醋、　個一塌糊涂、</p>
<p>本片的故事方面、綏無甚可取、但各場面演來尙覺活潑有趣、片中的　頭　域多麥格連、和領伶當　威好勇鬥狠的衣情、　他們互相愚在的演作、而片中的高潮　、神經病院的毆鬥場面、是片中最精彩之一幕、旣緊張　閙、而同時充滿着笑的資料、</p>
<p>東方……菲州拯友記</p>
<p>Bulldog　Drummond</p>
<p>In　Afrlca</p>
<p>大華……母子親情</p>

<h3>體格鍜錬應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>本文祗限於年齡在十六歲以上、四、歲以下的人、並不完全適合於兒童成老年人、不分性別、</p>
<p>體格鍛鍊是指心和身而　、在身的方面、不外發達肌肉、鍛鍊體格、會增進氣和力力、</p>
<p>欲有眞止　全的體格、於體格鍛煉上、必須心身並進、我們　認識鍛煉體格的目的一一健康、也要認清健康的目的、知忽視心的鍛鍊、雖有最强大的體力、亦不及獅、虎、猩猩等猛獸，</p>
<p>在身的方面、發達肌肉、鍛鍊內臟、增氣氣力三者也有相相互的關系、如忽略其一、不　身體各部不能平均發展、並反有傷害身體之虞、身的鍛鍊亦可　須由「內」而「外」、體格有相當基眞的人則可「内」「外」並進，「內」的鍛鍊則內臟的鍛鍊、「內藏的鍛鍊中、最重要的英如心、肺　腸、胃　部、　循環呼吸、消化三系統、此三系統如有正常而活的躍的作用、　　系統亦必　　强健起來、先强內部二後從事外部的鍛鍊發達肌肉、則可收事半功倍之效、</p>
<p>發達肌肉和鍛鍊氣力、在運動的方法上雖稍有差別、但祗要內部強健、肌肉發達、氣力自會隨着强　起來、</p>
<p>在心的鍛鍊上、不外堅强的意志、克苦耐勞的精神、光明正大的思想、高尙的品格、　等等、如缺乏心的鍛鍊、不僅失　健康的真意或不能達到健康的目的、其實、心和身也有互相的關係、如忽視心的鍛鍊、任身的鍛鍊、也很長收獲最大的效果、</p>
<p>運動并不是唯一的鍛鍊體格的方大、而是許多方法中的一個方法、　是鍛鍊體格唯一的積極的方法就是體育的的方法、體育的範圍很　、不是單指跑跑跳跳而　、切與健康有關的積極要素　應列入體育範圍、我們必須同時顧及所有的體育的方法、不可獨　一種或數種、否則、不僅不能收獲最大的效果、往往反而損害健、</p>
<p>在各種體育的方法中、我們很難　斷定那一種是最重要的、　　其中問題最多的　難解的方法就是運動的、　於運動、所說不一、各異其詞、甚至其理論有完全相反者、尤其是初入手的人史難解决各種運勸的問題、</p>
<p>在各種運動之中、最有效的就是徒手體和器械運動、這種運動的特點、　和各位討論過、不冉贅述、我們從事運動、如欲牧獲最大的效果、在方法上除使心身心進和身體『内』『外』平均發展之外、尚須注意下列下列各要點：一二（一）</p>

<h3>舊歷元旦的工作</h3>
<p>— 彭泰</p>
<p>給救亡工作同志的意見</p>
<p>舊曆新年就在目前了，老百姓爲了慶祝舊曆新年好像全心全意恭　了他底　祖公一樣，到丁舊曆的十二月尾和正月起頭，怎樣也不能不空下來，吃一頓，閒一囘。這時　便是救亡工作同志們的黄金時機，救亡工作者應該不放鬆這　會，而對於下面幾項工作，加以注意。</p>
<p>一，開展節約運動：誰都知道，燒香，點燭，化銀寶，放炮竹，還有貼門神，貼對聯，這是沒多大意義的習俗，澈底的廢除，有時是不容易的，我們就來想個折衷的辦法，好像去年惠陽平山某村一樣，把所有的答薩都請到一個林子裏，奉拜二次就够了，哈哈，這種集體的奉菩薩，也是新色新香的把戲，至於寫對聯，我們要替他們寫，我們爭取改變内容的機會。</p>
<p>其次如做粉果，打米糕，花糧食，又不合衛生，然而，鄉下人爲了舊例來　親戚，怎麼也不能聽我們的話來在親戚面前丢臉子，所以，我們要廣泛的開展宣傳。指　利害，最低限度我們也要使得他們盡量減少這種消費。</p>
<p>還有宴客的狂飲狂餐，流連不止，我們也要切切注意做這些事，　看環境接受性的深淺，還要　自巳的家庭自己的村子做起。</p>
<p>二，過年的一段日子中，大家荷包中總還搜得多少出錢，財主們更不成問題了，這時，我們正好大　的募捐，除了捐錢之外，就是食物亦好，好像惠陽的淡水坪山一帶，以前徵集過千幾二千袋　生來慰勞防軍一樣。現在我們巳可以募錢做寒衣也可以徵集糕來送給後方的難民和前綫上的將土，總之，我們在新年頭中來慕捐是比較容易的，我們展開金錢食物的募捐運動吧！</p>
<p>三，聯合武裝舉行大打獵：新年過後的短短時期中，一般人是相當有空閒的，這時，　很容易使他們走上不正當娛樂的塲所去，因此我們　動聯鄉聯姓大打獵，組織游擊隊的于段，再恰當也沒有了，從這活動中來知道他們武裝的力量，同時給他們游撃戰爭的戰術知識，呵，這有意義的運動，在我們反攻聲中來發勸，是十分有意義的，聽說淡水坪山一帶巳準備這樣做了。</p>
<p>四，如禁賭宣傳，春耕宣傳，學校復課宣傳……等等，也是應　力以求撻到而來的目標呀。</p>
<p>最後，我特別要介紹的。我們的宣傳隊要與鄉下人的舞獅隊配合　來，有很多的條件給我們力便。我們在他們的舞獅，打拳，對刀之前前後後，我們可以家揷歌詠，講話，幕把的街頭劇，那麽我們的宣傳收効是十分可以有把握的，募捐運動的募捐隊跟　這種舞聨隊，更是適合，紫金古竹抗日先鋒隊，現在就忙着　備配合這一時機了！</p>
<p>舊曆的新年，我們要表現出我們偉大的工作以達救濟　難的同胞，慰問抗*的將士的兩大目的。</p>
<h3>勤務兵</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>——戰地旅行雜感——</p>
<p>一位軍官的太太，問我爲什麽不帶　勤務兵，我說：「本來也有過一個勤務兵，後來在南京戰死了。我從山西南歸以後，深深覺得用勤務兵是不合理的。』我的意思是想吿訴她：「在軍隊中，　勤務兵做　軍中公務，那還可以說得過去：若斯勤務兵來替軍官太太當聽差，那是不應該的。「過了不久，她的勤務兵『開小差』，自己走了，她大爲發火說：「我　一件不好好兒看待他？打了牌，頭錢也是他的！吃的穿的，那一樣不比別人好，你看，那些兵，這天氣，還不是凍得打抖！』我因爲相識較久，就開誠對她說：『太太，這是你所不懂的：你說他樣樣不缺少，但他缺少了兩樣的重要的東西——「希望」和「光榮」。做軍官的勤務兵巳沒有多大希望，做軍官的太太勤務兵，更沒有希望；做軍官的勤務兵，巳不光樂。做軍官太太的勤務兵。更不光榮。你想：他卽有了希望，居然升了小軍官了，別人私下的說他，原是替某軍官太太做勤務乓的，他的　擱到那裏去？別人我不知，我自己卽算餓死凍死，決不做勤務兵，除非我的愛人做了軍官，她做穆桂英，我做楊宗保。」她們聽了，都相視大笑。</p>
<p>我的弟弟季　，在軍隊中過活多年，會綜括軍中人對於勤務兵的感想道：『五百年必有王者興，一千年難得一個好的勤務兵！一勤務兵之難得其人，彷彿比行政院長還不容易。仔細想來，並不是勤務兵　得其人，實在勤務兵這制度，根本是錯誤的，他們詛咒勤務兵的，原說其中聰明的會齣皮，揩油。姘軍官太太，無所不至：其老實的，蠢笨如牛，什　事都得撥一撥動一動，無時不嘔氣。但考察勤務兵所有的事務，當該軍官未發　時，都是他自己料理的，做了軍官，並無不能自己料理之埋。而那些替軍官太太服務的勤務乓。其實只是替太太省下了一個娘姨錢，拆突來說，也是　公家的油水，圖自己的利便，十二分不　該的。那軍官太太所以要用勤務兵，省錢固是一因，要表示自己是軍官的太太，更爲其主內，這也是一種極錯誤的心理。</p>
<p>我們過隨軍生活，曾相約自己的細務自己料理，養成自己服務的習慣；這習慣的結果很好，有時交互服務反而能增進深切的友誼。我常說官僚政治若不打破，使沒建國的希望，要打破官僚政治，先得從打破一布爾喬亞」的老爺太太觀念起。</p>
<p>一月二十七日在贛寄</p>
<h3>徬徨</h3>
<p>— 抱一</p>
<p>離羣的羊，無舵的舟，茫茫然飄泊在渺無邊際的人生中，一點抓不着實際，悲要，憤怒，榜徨，包圍了一身，耳聞，目睹，盡是悽慘的景象—</p>
<p>我不願再這樣地生活下去了，這樣的生活下去，我深信我的生命會無意義的斷送了的。我　驅除四周環繞着我的×人，我要衝破一切黑暗的環境，我要從徬徨的當中去求得砥直的道路，達到理想的樂地。</p>
<p>但，理想的勁敵，他絲毫不放鬆我，他更猙獰地向我肆威，用更殘酷的手段來加緊對我壓迫。生活的鞭笞，無情地向着我抽打，無寬裕的餘地，給我以喘息的機會。人情的險惡，處處施用着毒辣的手面來控制着我，我脆弱的心靈，經不起這樣的打擊，壓迫，我不禁痛楚起來而流淚了！</p>
<p>然而，單是靠了流淚，仍是脫不了悲哀，徬徨的境界。這不啻是向黑暗的環境表示屈服了，這顯然是環境的勝利對本身的痛苦絲　未得解脫．這除了表示是足的懦弱外，無其他積　的行動來代替奮鬭的。</p>
<p>我知道痛苦是螺旋式的，在人生的過程當中，是無窮盡的，不明白人生觀的人，把痛苦和安樂分成兩個部份，其實痛苦和安樂是永遠地聯擊在一起的；沒有痛苦，就不知道有安樂，知道了痛苦，然後纔能體會到安樂呢。</p>
<p>我要從痛苦的深淵當中，力自振作起來：教要用最大的决心，來克服黑暗的環境，不悲觀，不徬徨，一心一意地向着理想的樂地走去。對以前人生觀念的口誤，失却奮鬥的勇氣，從今天須大大的改變一下。那就是要用堅强的决心，使什替悲觀和徬徨，來穩定未來的前途。</p>
<h3>残照裏</h3>
<p>— 洪焰</p>
<p>四野裏靜悄悄的，北風很和緩地吹着。夕陽爬到了生命的邊緣，漲紅了臉，在獰視　人地。</p>
<p>阿福，小陸，老劉，三個兒緩緩地定到　上去，齊聲哼着老劉——年靑堅强的凍北人新做的歌兒；</p>
<p>提起那民二十年的事，</p>
<p>那會使鐵人淚下；　我們的田地給×人踐踏</p>
<p>三千萬同胞變成牛馬！</p>
<p>我們被禁禁止自己的話</p>
<p>我們被趕出了自己的家。</p>
<p>我們冉聽不到黑龍江鳴咽的寒潮，</p>
<p>再看不見長白山上那輝耀的雲花！</p>
<p>但，我們毋庸怨嗟。</p>
<p>我們决不讓×人的旗幟長久飄揚，</p>
<p>我們要以眼還眼以牙還牙！</p>
<p>同胞們團結起來，</p>
<p>用　腥的戰　做我們的回答！</p>
<p>用血腥的戰鬥做我們的回答！囘答！反覆地呼　，離開西村只有三里多路了！</p>
<p>「老劉！你說，碰到要搜査的時候，怎辦，這幾桿傢伙？」阿福忽然輕輕地問那勇敢的鄕下人，一邊撫摩着左邊胸前微微突起的東西</p>
<p>『傻子，怕什麽！不給咱們麻煩。那算了，給他們多活幾個　點，不然，哼！不耐煩活，送他們囘去得啦！」老劉爽利地這樣囘答。</p>
<p>「不過，這對於我們的任務有些兒不便當　！』小陸冷冷地說着。</p>
<p>沒有第二個人接下去說話，四圍空氣也寂靜了下來。</p>
<p>突然阿爾拉住老劉的衣袖，止住在路上，輕輕的用嘴向前努者：「哼！當心！來啦！』</p>
<p>在前面十來丈路的地方。兩個東西抱着兩　三八，嘻嘻哈哈的向這邊走來。</p>
<p>「別管他，向前留心地走吧！太陽快下去了呢！」老劉若無其事地說。</p>
<p>近了，兩面只離開丈把路了！</p>
<p>兩個東西大搖大　喝醉了似地繙動驚　看見這邊三個雄赳赳的伙伴，趕忙就拿起上着剌刀的三八，嘴裏咕嚕着：</p>
<p>「站住！站住！壞來西！游擊　。」</p>
<p>「他媽的！得大爺動手，』老劉　駡着，即　向，小陸阿福使了個眼色。</p>
<p>兩個立刻向前走了一步，站在路中，舉着手。老劉亦跟着這　做，但　的趣位比較落後一些。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈……對方得意地　着，都一手握着步槍，一手來搜小陸阿福他們的身上。</p>
<p>出其不意的老劉擭下了那亮閃閃的剌刀，隨即敏捷的一刀直戳進了搜着小　的那個的腦壳。倒了！</p>
<p>另一個正想囘身逃，阿福早就一把拖住了。想叫，小陸已一手蓋住了他的嘴吧！他漲紅着臉，拚命地掙扎著！</p>
<p>老劉照那個一樣給他頭頂上開了個窟隆，一邊嘴嘆恨恨地　着：</p>
<p>『小雜種，躭誤了大爺的時光！今天大爺得爽快的多宰你幾個！哼，你們快活啊，』</p>
<p>夕陽漲着煊紅的面巳決到地平綫，在沒落前還返射着一抹殘光。</p>
<h3>三夢蹟</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>明英宗和景宗時，也先入寇，正是現今×人的影子。屢次索賄，從無饜足；輕視中國，以爲一戰可取，等到于謙在京師抗戰，　知道中國實未可侮，大大的碰了一個釘子。一西湖佳話」卷之八「三　夢蹟」就是專寫于謙的生平的。所述大部份根據明史卷一百七十本傳。惟開端叙于謙幼時軼事，則取之傳說。連泥塑的神也怕于謙，被派往嶺南充車就害怕，被命令屈膝就只得依從，這種故事是我們常在林蘭所輯的「朱洪武故事」裏所能看到的，至於出口成章，認對敏捷。那又在林蘭所輯的「趣聯的故事」裏常可見到。至於專與和尙屬對談話，那只是爲了本傳上台這樣兩句話：「有佾奇之曰：「他日救時幸相也！」』在三　夢蹟裏，便是：那和尙道：「諸君莫笑，此子骨格不凡，出口成章，他日撥亂宰相也！」</p>
<p>關於于謙守京師禦也先之事，明史本傳和西湖遊覽志餘卷八都有記載。明史較好，不　志餘那樣的迂闊：寫戰爭場面，亦以明史爲較有聲色，不像志餘那樣的有氣無力。時爲景泰元年十月，明史云：「也先挾上皇破紫荆關一直入窺京師，石亨議斂兵堅壁老之。謙不可，曰：「奈何示弱，使×益輕我！」亟分遺諸將率師二十二萬，列陣九門外。悉閉諸城門，身自督戰，下令：「臨陣將不顧軍先退者，斬其將：軍不顧將先退者，後隊斬前隊。」於是將士知必死，皆用命。初，也先深入，視京師可旦夕下。及見軍官嚴陣待，意稍沮。叛閱喜寗嗾使邀大臣迎駕，索金帛以萬萬計，帝不許，也先氣益沮。庚申，寇窺德勝們，謙令亨設伏空舍，遺數騎誘×，×以萬騎來薄，副總兵范廣發火器，伏起齊擊之，也先弟中槍死。彭義門寇逐至土城，居民升屋號呼，投磚石擊寇；　聲動天。援至，寇乃却，相持五日，也先邀請旣不應，戰又不利，知終弗可得志，遂擁上皇西去，謙調諸將追擊至關而還。論功加謙少保，總督軍務。」（節）至於三臺夢　的本文，我想可以在此不必繁引了。</p>
<p>上面引文有兩點可以注意，第一，也先「視京師且夕可下」，此與敵人之估計台免莊一撇，及至受挂以後，方　歎了一口氣說：「想不到小小的台兒莊，這樣的困難！一第二，民衆升屋以磚石抗戰，獲得成功，於此更足見民衆武裝之必要，　若全國皆兵，處處可戰，那未×人將防不勝防，終至於崩潰了。</p>
<p>于謙的愛國可於志餘卷八見之：「景泰間北　南征，軍務旁　。公常一日而平章者數端，夜分乃罷，輒　膺曰：「一腔血竟灑何地！」」</p>
<p>他的詩在明詩紀事乙籤卷十一中存有五首。志餘並錄斷句。如詠蘇武云：「富　儻　君莫問，丹心報國是男兒。」又云：「蕭　行囊君莫笑，獨留　劍倚靑天」。均「可以知其孤介絕谷之操」和「忠直之氣」。</p>
<p>明人追念　謙的詩，較　名的有黄鳳翔的「謁于少保祠」云：「九鼎奠如山，邊　靜若捲」。又，楊焯的「拜于忠肅公墳」云：「憶昔景泰年間事，隻手扶天助天討。司馬門前鐵　寒，居庸關外攙槍掃」。</p>
<p>某君所作「五千年來中華民族魂」（？）以于謙爲四中樞之一，與謝安李綱虞允文並列，足見推崇之至。</p>
<p>寫于謙的小晚，尙有明孫高充的「于少保萃忠全傳」拾卷四拾傳。還有一種明人的一正統傳一是舒于謙的。前者存而後者巳佚，足見「公道自在人心」了。</p>

<h3>Intensifying Improvement of Military and Political Issues</h3>
<p>The all-out war of resistance has transitioned from its first stage to its second, and a stalemate has emerged in various battlefields, both north and south. The situation of the enemy being superior and us being inferior, the enemy advancing and us retreating, is undergoing drastic change. While we have not completely halted the enemy's offensive, we have indeed partially succeeded in containing and disrupting it. Furthermore, in some areas, we have even begun the task of dismantling the enemy's forces and recovering lost territory. In particular, coupled with the strengthening of national unity in the political realm, the resolute determination to wage a protracted war, the depravity of pro-Japanese traitors and appeasers, the active progress of the international peace front, and the materialization of Soviet, American, and British aid to China, the shifting war situation is developing at an accelerated pace. The recent reckless provocation by the enemy, the "September 18th Incident in the Pacific," has given the Sino-Japanese war a more concrete form as an international conflict, intensifying the two-front war. This will undoubtedly have a very significant impact on the future of our war of resistance. We must seize this opportunity to actively improve our military, political, party affairs, and people's movements, ensuring that we can gain more time in this stalemated war situation, implement all new military and political plans, prepare to launch a counter-offensive strategy, and complete the great task of driving out the enemy, recovering lost territory, and building a new China.</p>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council was established recently and held its first meeting. Party and political committees in various war zones will also be established one after another. We sincerely hope that the relevant authorities, in light of the current war situation and domestic and international circumstances, will make further improvements to the entire military and political system, actively expand the all-out war situation, and drive the enemy into greater difficulties, in order to achieve the ultimate victory of our war of resistance. Here, based on our knowledge and insights, we offer several humble suggestions for reference, hoping that the people of the country will pay attention and work together to promote progress.</p>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council is currently the highest authority in our country's war of resistance and nation-building. Its members are mostly responsible officials from the Kuomintang's party, political, and military departments. The earnest expectations of people across the country and around the world are self-evident. There is no need to elaborate on the numerous military and political aspects that need improvement. However, based on the experience and lessons learned from twenty months of heroic resistance, we deeply understand the hardships of the war's development. The enemy has not abandoned its conspiracies of "quick victory," "using Chinese to control Chinese," "dividing China," and "anti-communist armistice," precisely because its domestic and international crises are becoming increasingly serious; otherwise, its future would be unimaginable. And what we rely on to overcome all difficulties, strive for final victory, and save ourselves from peril is the intensification of national unity, the development of a united front, and the unwavering determination to fight the war of resistance to the end. Now, while the enemy is actively preparing for a larger reckless war, it is also continuing to instigate pro-Japanese traitors, using the pretext of "anti-communism" and "peace" in an attempt to alienate our internal unity, undermine our all-out war of resistance, and achieve the complete subjugation of our country. Meanwhile, a small number of stubborn elements and ignorant people within our country continue to adhere to defeatist views and partisan prejudices, effectively becoming a special operations force for the Japanese and traitors. At the same time, the compromise policy of foreign rulers toward the aggressor further facilitates the enemy's conspiracy to halt our war of resistance. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council should strictly adhere to the basic principles of "uniting the nation and persisting in the war of resistance" adopted at the Kuomintang's Provisional National Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, on one hand, swiftly realize a sound and well-developed organizational form for the united front, enabling the vibrant forces of all anti-Japanese political parties, ethnic groups, social strata, and people from all walks of life to be quickly and effectively concentrated under unified leadership, striving for the final victory of the war of resistance and the ultimate success of nation-building. On the other hand, intensify the elimination of all openly treasonous traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and puppet organizations, intensify the purging of lurking traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and their secret organizations and propaganda organs, and intensify the crushing of all conspiracies such as "anti-communism," "peace," and "international mediation" that could destroy our country, harm our nation, and endanger the world.</p>
<p>The Party and Political Committee is currently the highest authority in each war zone for unified handling of military, political, party affairs, and people's movement work. It is the glorious and great culmination of twenty months of experience and lessons learned from heroic resistance. The successive establishment of Party and Political Committees in various war zones fills people with infinite joy and anticipation. We would like to offer two particularly important opinions for responsible authorities to implement or consider. First, while the unified leadership and execution of military, political, party affairs, and people's movements in each war zone are urgently needed, economic work is even more urgently needed to obtain appropriate adjustments and unified, planned promotion. Therefore, we believe that in addition to presiding over military, political, and party affairs, the Party and Political Committee should also be responsible for economic work. First, all expenses related to military, party affairs, political, and people's movement needs in the war zone should be managed by the Party and Political Committee, correcting all past malpractices and difficulties. Second, implement political mobilization, expand economic work in the war zone, on one hand, destroy the enemy and traitor's economic plunder, and on the other hand, concentrate and develop appropriate and necessary economic forces. However, two points should be particularly emphasized here: one is to thoroughly eliminate the tendency of bureaucratism and thoroughly eliminate corrupt officials and feudal remnants; the other is to re-employ young talents with a strong sense of national consciousness, revolutionary spirit, and prestige among the masses.</p>
<p>Second, while we believe that the final victory can be achieved earlier, we cannot have muddled optimism. We would rather anticipate that we may encounter more dangerous traps and more serious attacks in the process of our war of resistance and nation-building, and we would rather anticipate that our war of resistance and nation-building will go through a very long and arduous struggle. Therefore, how to cultivate cadres is a very important and urgent issue at present. It has recently been rumored that Chen Cheng and Ye Jianying have been appointed to organize cadre training schools, although this has not yet been confirmed, but the urgency of the situation requires it, and it is expected that there will be factual developments soon. What we want to remind the relevant authorities and the people of the country is that, first, not only should a national large-scale organization of this kind of military and political cadre training school be established, but also training classes should be established in various war zones and troops under the program of war of resistance and nation-building and unified leadership. On one hand, meet the increasing demands of the front line, and on the other hand, intensify the establishment of a new leadership for the counter-offensive, driving out the enemy, and building a new China.</p>
<p>Second, the Three Principles of the People Youth League's call to open its doors to patriotic youth across the country is still an urgent requirement today. Only by enabling the youth of the whole country to participate in the national united front and fight heroically can we guarantee the final success of our war of resistance and nation-building.</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds with Sophistry; Britain and France Discuss Countermeasures; The Two Governments Maintain Close Contact; The Enemy Lands in the Southern Part of Hainan Island</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming by This Newspaper, 14th] The enemy occupies Hainan Island. Long Yun said that the occupied guard post of the Pacific gate is tantamount to the beginning of the Pacific War. The enemy's purpose this time is to directly threaten Annam and indirectly monitor Britain and France, not to attack Guilin, and it has little impact on our war of resistance. French diplomacy is weak and can only laugh and cry. Democratic countries should no longer protest verbally or in writing, but should adopt a tough attitude to be of practical help.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] According to enemy sources, at about 5:00 a.m. on the 14th, enemy troops landed again at Sanya Bay, west of Yulin, at the southern end of Hainan Island, and invaded Sanya Street from Xincun.</p>
<p>Britain and France successively Lodge Protests with the Enemy Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, the governments of France and Britain successively lodged protests with the Japanese government on the same day, demanding an explanation of the reasons and nature of this move, and how long it would last. According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already submitted a reply, which mainly consists of five points: (1) Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is purely for military reasons, to destroy China's resistance; (2) Japan will continue to occupy the island until its goal is achieved; (3) The Japanese government has no intention of infringing upon the interests held by Britain and France. The British Foreign Office is currently studying this reply, and the governments of Britain and France will consult with each other to determine the appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Tokyo News. Regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, Foreign Minister Arita explained the matter to British Ambassador Craig this morning, and the assurances he provided were exactly the same as those he gave to French Ambassador Henri yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Tokyo News. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Foreign Minister Arita at 9:30 this morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] Under-Secretary Butler stated in response to a question from a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons yesterday that the government has been in contact with the French government regarding the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island. Conservative Member of Parliament Milner asked whether Japan had notified Britain and France of its intentions before occupying the island, and whether it had notified them of relevant information after the occupation. The Under-Secretary said that the points raised by Mr. Milner were of utmost importance, and he hoped that the relevant parties would pay attention to them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Conservative Member of Parliament Milner raised an inquiry about the Hainan Island issue. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied that the governments of Britain and France were exchanging opinions on how to jointly safeguard their respective interests.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with Japanese Ambassador Shiratori today to discuss the international repercussions caused by the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island.</p>
<p>The Philippines Feels Threatened; An American Warship Sails to Qiongzhou for Investigation</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 14th] The U.S. destroyer "Edsall" has been ordered to proceed from Hong Kong to Haikou, Hainan Island, to investigate the situation there and provide assistance to American expatriates. The ship is expected to arrive tonight.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] The Navy Department has announced that the destroyer USS John D. Edwards, belonging to the U.S. South China Fleet, is scheduled to proceed to the northern coast of Hainan Island, China, on the 14th of this month for a routine voyage.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] The U.S. naval community heard that the U.S. destroyer Edsall will make a one- or two-day stopover in Haikou this time, and then sail to Hong Kong. If there are American expatriates living in Haikou who wish to leave, they can take the ship back to Hong Kong. Also, the U.S. ship Alden left Hong Kong yesterday and is expected to arrive in Haiphong tomorrow. The ship carries supplies for warships and five U.S. sailors to replace those on American ships. After arriving in Haiphong, they will report to Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] In the southeastern Pacific, speculations are rife about the motives of Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, and a widespread sense of unease is growing. According to sources in Saigon, some well-informed people say that Japan intends to turn Hainan Island into a submarine base. Because Hainan Island is located in a strategic location, it is an ideal base for attacking Singapore, the Philippines, and Annam. Moreover, it straddles the main trade routes in the Far East, and the importance of its position can be imagined. Hainan Island is very close to the Philippines, no less than the gateway to the island. Therefore, if Japan occupies the island for a long time, with the weakness of the Philippines' national defense capabilities, it will lack a sense of security. For this reason, people in the Philippines who advocate independence are greatly discouraged. Military experts say that if Japan uses Hainan Island as a naval base, it will be easy to blockade Hong Kong, and its position as a hegemon in the Pacific will become more consolidated. It is reported that France is currently making every effort to strengthen the defenses of Tonkin Bay in Annam.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] Philippine officials and newspapers are still paying close attention to the Hainan Island issue. The Philippine Vanguard recently commented on Chairman Chiang's remarks on the Hainan Island issue, saying that Chairman Chiang's analysis of the situation may indeed have some basis in fact, which is an undeniable fact. If we are convinced that Hainan Island does not have a significant impact on the current Sino-Japanese war in terms of strategy, then we cannot but reach a conclusion, that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island must have a greater purpose. Some say that Japan's move is only one of Japan's military plans to invade China, but if Chairman Chiang's predictions unfortunately come true, then his warning to the countries of the Pacific should not be ignored, and the Philippines should listen to his warning and know what to be vigilant about.</p>
<h3>The Han and French Clash Again; The Japanese Blockade the Concession Again Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] This agency received a special report from Hankou stating that the Japanese authorities today once again strictly implemented a blockade on the transport of various food items into the French Concession. The Japanese army had previously banned food from overseas from being transported to the French Concession. After the French and Japanese authorities signed an agreement for the sake of the sustenance of the Chinese people in the concession, the ban was lifted. It is reported that this incident was caused by a new dispute between the French and Japanese sides.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] According to a report from this agency's reporter in Hankou, the origin of the Japanese authorities' sudden prohibition of food from entering the French Concession was because the French authorities did not allow the Japanese army to pass through the newly opened street in the French Concession. Therefore, the Japanese authorities took retaliatory measures, not only strictly prohibiting various food items, but also strictly restricting the entry and exit of all people, both Chinese and foreign. It is also said that the Japanese authorities do not allow the International Red Cross to transport food to the French Concession to relieve refugees, and demand that it be distributed by the Hankou Puppet Security Committee.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Gansu and Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] Enemy planes have been reconnaissance and bombing in various parts of Shaanxi and Gansu for days, doing their utmost to vent their brutality. According to people from Pingliang, when enemy planes wantonly harassed Pingliang a few days ago, it happened to be the time of the mule and horse market, and merchants returning home gathered in the county town. The enemy planes then indiscriminately bombed civilians and livestock, and strafed with machine guns, killing more than a hundred unarmed civilians and eighty mules and horses.</p>
<h3>The Government Attaches Importance to Education in the Border Areas; The Border Education Committee is Established; Chen Lifu Serves Concurrently as Chairman</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper, 14th] The Border Education Committee has been established, with Chen Lifu serving concurrently as chairman, to thoroughly improve education in Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Xikang. The National Education Conference is scheduled to be convened in early March, focusing on the education of the occupied areas.</p>
<h3>Responding to Britain and the United States, France Sends a Note to Japan, Denouncing the So-Called "New Order"; Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Publishes the Full Text</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] After the governments of the United States and Britain successively sent notes to Japan, refuting its so-called "New Order in East Asia" and declaring their intention to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty and not allow Japan to unilaterally revise it, the French envoy to Japan also submitted a similar note to Japan on the 19th of last month in response. Although there were records in domestic newspapers at the time, the content was brief and unclear. This agency has obtained the full text from the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the translated version is published as follows for the reference of those who are concerned about foreign affairs. The translated version is as follows: "The undersigned has been instructed to inform Your Excellency that the Imperial Government has recently issued a declaration, which is intended to promote the policy of the Imperial Government in the East, and the French Government has taken special note of it. The French Government believes that this policy is inconsistent with the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. The French Government wishes to point out that any changes in the situation created by the existing treaty in China, which have not been consulted and agreed upon in advance by the countries concerned, will be difficult for the French Government to recognize or accept. The French Government still believes that the principles stipulated in the Washington Treaty of February 6, 1922, have not lost any of their value, and only by respecting these principles can the problems caused by Japan's actions in China be satisfactorily resolved by third countries. The French Government does not believe that the Imperial Government intends to unilaterally abandon the provisions of the treaty that it freely acceded to, or to change the situation created by such provisions, and to place third countries before a fait accompli, the nature of which is sufficient to seriously harm the interests of third countries. If the Imperial Government believes that the situation in the Far East allows for adjustments to the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, then its first task must undoubtedly be to notify other signatory countries of the suggestions that the Imperial Government deems appropriate, and based on the same assumption, the French Government will give the most careful study to the opinions put forward by the Imperial Government."</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Talks About the Progress of the War of Resistance - Continued</h3>
<p>At the Enlarged Memorial Week in Yunnan</p>
<p>Advancing is Safety, Retreating is a Dead End</p>
<p>In the military aspect, our supreme strategies are protracted war and all-out war. Strategically, based on the achievements of the war of resistance over the past nineteen months, the foundation for our victory has been laid. The enemy's dream of a quick victory has been shattered by us and suffered a major defeat. And we are getting more and more, fighting harder and stronger. In the future, in addition to mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare, we must also widely launch all-out war. Regardless of east, west, north, or south, it will become a battlefield, and men, women, old, and young will participate in the war of resistance. Even culture and education must be mobilized. Shanxi is a current example. Now I will report on the situation in the Guangdong area. Recent rumors in Guangzhou, not to mention their landing in Beihai, say that they have built large airfields in Dongjing or Weizhou Island. Many people are afraid that the enemy will attack Yunnan. I can guarantee that the enemy has no such strength or tactics. If it lands in Beihai and attacks Yunnan, it will have to pass through Guangxi and Guiyang. Due to traffic congestion, and the presence of high mountains and steep ridges, it will probably have difficulty even reaching Guangxi. Moreover, the Beihai-Nanning highway has been thoroughly destroyed by us, making it extremely difficult to transport mechanized units and supplies. In addition, the people of Guangxi have been universally mobilized under the leadership of young people. They are firmly grasping the belief that politics is more important than military affairs, and guerrilla warfare is more important than positional warfare, and are earnestly preparing to unite the army and the people and cooperate sincerely. If the enemy really takes the risk of advancing, then we will mobilize the whole nation to attack them, expand the southwestern theater, and strive for the glory of our nation. I am not afraid of my hometown because the Japanese are invading our land. We command hundreds of thousands of soldiers to travel thousands of miles, struggling in the Yangtze River area, where the climate and terrain are not suitable. How can we not fight them when they come to our door with suitable conditions? (Thunderous applause) We are not afraid of the enemy attacking Nanning and Liuzhou. If it really wants to try, it will inevitably repeat Napoleon's advance on Moscow. Everyone should not think about finding a safe place to retreat every day. You must know that advancing is safety, and retreating is a dead end (applause). In short, in the past nineteen months, the enemy has occupied our land, but only at points and lines. As for the vast area, it is still in our hands. The future of the war of resistance is bright.</p>
<p>The Entire Far East Question is a World Question</p>
<p>Economically, we are an agricultural country, so even though the enemy has blockaded our seaports, it does not matter much, because our economic strength is in the countryside, not in the cities. Even if our arms transport is more difficult than before, we can manufacture them ourselves, especially our guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, the consumption of arms is very small. At the same time, Britain and the United States have given us great help, and the trend of actively sanctioning Japan, I am afraid that there will be more partner countries in the future. This is the sympathy we have gained from the bloody battle of millions of soldiers.) (Applause)</p>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, the League of Nations is powerless in the Nine-Power Treaty, but it is still a line of assistance. The importance of the Nine-Power Treaty is that Britain, the United States, and France have all risen up to provide assistance. Especially the peace and democratic front of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, we must grasp this assistance. We must understand that Japan's aggression against China is a problem for the entire Far East and also a world problem. As long as the United States deploys troops in the Pacific, and a large number of Russian planes are sent to Siberia and Vladivostok, and Britain and France are prepared in the Indian Ocean. At that time, will Japan not submit? [Continued on page four]</p>
<h3>The Western Transportation Network is Being Intensively Completed</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] A Hua source reports that the 1,200-kilometer railway project from Yunnan to Myanmar will be completed within two years. At present, China can only obtain foreign arms supplies through highway transportation. It is also reported that the National Government is now negotiating with France and the Soviet Union to establish air routes to connect China with the Soviet Union and Vietnam. In addition, the Sino-British air route connecting Chongqing and Yangon may be established in mid-March.</p>
<h3>An Enemy Bomber Forced to Land in Shayang, Central Hubei; Four People on Board Attempt to Escape by Boat; None Escape After Our Pursuit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yichang, 13th] On the morning of February 1st, a strong wind and rain struck central Hubei. An enemy heavy bomber was forced to land in the air above Shayang on Shazhou, about thirteen miles northwest of the nearby area. It was discovered by our army, who opened fire. The enemy plane then struggled to fly again, but the nose of the plane was damaged. It only managed to cross Xiangyang before finally landing at Guankou. The people in the plane found a small boat in the river, killed the boatman, and sailed downstream in a hurry. When they passed Shayang, our river defense sentries called them to shore for inspection. The boat ignored the order, and our guards immediately pursued in a boat. At that time, the wind and waves were surging in the river. When they were chased to Xincheng, about twenty miles from Shayang, the front boat was about a hundred meters away. The people on the boat immediately opened fire on us. We returned fire. At this time, the enemy quickly threw the documents, objects, and machine guns in the boat into the river. The boat also stopped at this point. Our army boarded the boat for inspection and found that four people had been killed, and two others were seriously injured and died shortly after reaching the shore. Many important charts and other items, as well as amulets, talismans, and diaries, were found in the boat. The reporter personally saw the symbols, armbands, collar badges, and business cards worn by the six enemies in Shayang, all belonging to enemy aviation Colonel Watanabe Hirota, Majors Okuda Yuzo, Takahashi Fukujiro, wireless employee Izumisawa Nobuo, maintenance worker Warrant Officer Tani Satakashi, and Shimmura Shigejiro.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders All Military Districts to Strictly Prohibit Illegal Conscription; New Recruits are Specifically Allowed to Report Derelict Officials</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper, 14th] The Ministry of Military Affairs, upon the order of Chairman Chiang, telegraphed all provincial military districts, stating that after new recruits enlist in the army, the training officers should first inquire in detail about their family situation, background, and experience. If they were illegally conscripted, they are allowed to report it. After verification, the person in charge of the conscription agency and the Baojia chief in the district will be thoroughly investigated and punished.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Northern Front: We Recapture Ren County, While Gan, E, and Xiang Provinces Adopt a Defensive Posture</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 14th] Gan, E, and Xiang provinces are all adopting a defensive posture, and the battle situation is quiet. The provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, and Hebei are more active, constantly engaging in fierce battles with us. Teng Jing is currently in southern Hebei, and Umezu has arrived in Taiyuan. In the areas of Xinxiang, Xiuwu, Yangwu, and Yuanwu in northern Henan, there are approximately eight to nine thousand [Japanese troops], with over a thousand in Yuanwu. An attempted southward advance was repelled, and we recaptured Yangqiao Lai Tongzhai and other places. Guerrilla warfare is intense on the border between Shandong and Hebei. A portion of the [Japanese] forces in western Shandong opened up towards southern Hebei, and we are intercepting and attacking them separately.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 14th] In southern Shanxi, a certain brigade of our forces engaged in a bloody battle with the [Japanese] for seven days and nights in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Yesterday, they advanced towards Wenxi and encountered the [Japanese] in battle, inflicting heavy casualties. The [Japanese] forces in Linfen have increased to three thousand, and the [Japanese] forces in Yicheng and Qinshui are being transferred towards Hejin. Fierce battles have been taking place near Jishan since the 11th. The main force of the [Japanese] Ushijima Division is also gathering in this direction. Ren County in Hebei Province was recaptured by the troops of Shi Yousan on the 11th, annihilating over five hundred [Japanese troops]. The remaining [Japanese troops] fled in defeat to Xingtai. Our North China Guerrilla Force has shattered the [Japanese] encirclement line.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 14th) The [Japanese] forces in Heshun fled in defeat towards Tulianping and Niuchuan. We are currently in pursuit. Xiyang is under our counter-offensive. The [Japanese] 'mopping-up' operation in eastern Shanxi has failed. Transportation between Houma and Xinjiang is very busy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] Military news, the situation in southern Hebei in brief is as follows: (1) Fierce battles are raging in the suburbs of Julu. Our troops annihilated hundreds of [Japanese soldiers] in the area of Dongnan Di Village and Yangliu Xing in the east of the city, capturing over thirty warhorses and a large amount of supplies. One unit of our [forces] in Liu Village, northwest of [Julu], defeated over two hundred reinforcing [Japanese soldiers], killing sixty to seventy [Japanese soldiers] and seizing over ten boxes of ammunition. (2) Several hundred [Japanese troops] from Dacheng advanced south towards Shizhuang but were defeated by a certain unit of our army, killing and wounding forty to fifty [Japanese soldiers].

<h3>The Newspaper Industry in the Wartime Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhi Wo</p>
<p>[Special Chongqing Airmail Dispatch] After the fall of Wuhan, several newspapers with a long history and a large readership retreated with important government agencies in order to preserve their strength in using words for war propaganda. Chongqing is now the center of our military, political, and economic efforts for resisting Japan, building the nation, and reviving the nation, and it is also our temporary capital. Cultural undertakings are inseparable from the concentration of national power, so after the fall of Wuhan, newspapers from various places mostly moved to Chongqing one after another to continue publishing. Not only newspapers moved, but also various publishing houses and magazine publishers all moved to Chongqing to resume their responsibility for war propaganda.</p>
<p>Chongqing formerly had a population of over 200,000. Since the beginning of the war of resistance eighteen months ago, the number of people who have moved in from various places has gradually increased. As of recently, it has reached a population density of 750,000. It can be said that, excluding the major cities in the occupied areas, Chongqing is now the only large metropolis in the country. Before the war, there were five or six large and small newspapers, including the Xinshu Daily, Guomin Gongbao, Shangwu Daily, Jichuan Gongbao, and Dalu Evening News. Among them, Xinshu and Guomin both had a history of twenty or thirty years. They were published daily on three large sheets and had very good circulation. They were relatively healthy newspapers in the local area. Last spring, the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao, Nanjing Xinminbao, and Nanjing Evening News moved here one after another. At the same time, the [Nationalist Government's] Headquarters also started a Southwest Daily, which aroused a great wave in the newspaper industry of this wartime capital. Although all newspapers reduced their size and changed to one sheet as required by the Central Propaganda Department, business competition was fierce. The Xinminbao was published daily on one sheet of four-open paper. It was short, concise, and well-arranged, and it was able to compete with the larger newspapers. For a time, its circulation even exceeded that of the major newspapers, and it became a pivotal voice among Chongqing's mid-sized newspapers.</p>
<p>After November of last year, the major newspapers of Wuhan and Changsha retreated here. The Dagongbao, Zhongyang, Xinhua, Saodang, Dajiang, and Wuhan Shibao were published in Chongqing one after another. For business reasons, the Xinshu Daily also started a Xinshu Evening News at this time. As of now, there are eleven major newspapers, two mid-sized newspapers, and three evening newspapers in Chongqing. In a metropolis with a population of 750,000, after deducting seven-tenths for illiteracy, there are only less than 300,000 readers. Yet there are sixteen newspapers, large, medium, and evening, which can be said to be suffering from indigestion. Therefore, the reputable major newspapers have a maximum daily circulation of only 12,000 to 13,000 copies, the average is only 5,000 to 6,000 copies, and the lowest is only about 2,000 to 3,000 copies.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Chongqing's newspapers are clearly divided into local newspapers and newspapers from other places. The Xinshu Daily and Guomin Gongbao are naturally the best of the local newspapers. Among the newspapers from other places, the Dagongbao, Shishi, Zhongyang, Saodang, and Xinhua are all about the same. The biggest difference in their circulation is only 1,000 to 2,000 copies. The Shishi Xinbao moved here several months earlier, so its roots are slightly deeper, and its circulation and advertisements are slightly better.</p>
<p>Except for the Dagongbao, the others all have their own printing facilities. However, because it is difficult to find a complete building, the Central, Saodang, and Xinhua, which moved here later, all have their printing plants and editorial departments located in two or three places. The editorial department of the Central Daily News is located on Ducheng Street, squeezed into the upstairs of a grocery store. In the same courtyard, there is a billiards room, a Shenping Book Tea House, and others... In short, the environment is a noisy place. When the editor looks out, he can really 'be dazzled by a riot of color, and deafened by the din of pipes and strings.' The machinery of the Dagongbao was transported by boat when it retreated from Wuhan, but it has not yet arrived. Someone asked Mr. Wang Yunsheng, and Mr. Wang said, 'It has been transported, but only God knows when it will arrive.'</p>
<p>Because of transportation, printing materials such as newsprint and ink are extremely scarce here. Neither rolled nor flat newsprint can be purchased. The Saodang, Dagong, Shishi, Xinshu, Xinmin, Guomin, and Dajiang are using old stock that was transported here six months ago. It is feared that it will soon be exhausted. The Xinhua, Central, Southwest, Jichuan, and Shangwu have all switched to using local paper a month ago. Sichuan has produced local paper for more than ten years, and newspapers have been using it for more than ten years as well. The first local paper produced was only flat, and it was too soft and not durable. Since the war of resistance, demand has exceeded supply. The paper mills have added strength and strived for perfection because of the development of business. Mass production has reached its peak, and rolled paper has also been produced. The paper has good toughness. The only difference is that, due to raw materials and technology, it cannot be changed from the yellow color of grass paper to the white color of Western newspapers, which is even inferior to the domestic newspapers in Jiangxi. Locals call this paper 'Jiale Paper.'</p>
<p>There are five or six factories specializing in the production of "Jiale Paper" in Hechuan, Yongchuan, Bishan, and Rongchang counties in Sichuan. Only one factory in Yongchuan makes rolled paper. The Central and Xinhua both use "Jiale rolled paper." This kind of rolled paper is not priced by weight but by ream, and each ream costs 24 yuan. Flat "Jiale Paper" sells for 18 yuan per ream. There are also various inferior grades, which sell for 16 yuan and 14 yuan. The factories are operating day and night, but demand still exceeds supply. Some people worry that in five months, when the other newspaper offices run out of their stock of paper, they will have to switch to local paper, and it is feared that soaring paper prices will be a minor issue. A paper shortage will be inevitable.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently making great efforts to encourage the relocation of inland paper mills or the revival of local closed paper mills as a way to alleviate the paper shortage. It is said that some people are preparing to invest heavily in building a large factory, but 'distant water cannot quench present thirst.' The immediate difficulties will probably remain unresolved.</p>
<p>Most of the publishing houses that retreated to Chongqing with the fall of Wuhan have already resumed operations. But since paper is scarce and printing is difficult, the printing factories that each had special contracts with in Hankou are all operating at full capacity and cannot handle large-scale printing, which has had a very dire impact on the publishing industry. Several houses, including Shenghuo, Datong, Tianma, and Xinzhi, have not published a single new book in six months, and they are still selling the old stock that they brought back from Wuhan.</p>
<p>There are over seventy kinds of magazines, weeklies, semi-monthlies, and monthlies, as well as war songs, literary and political commentaries, and military celebrations, including those originally published locally in Sichuan and those that have retreated from various places. Everyone is still working hard as before. The only difference is that traffic is inconvenient, sales in other places are stagnant, and paper and ink are too expensive, so they dare not print too much. Among them, "China's Air Force," "Digest," "National War of Resistance," and "Guoxun" have the best sales, but the most is only 10,000 copies, and the least is 3,000 to 4,000 copies. Over twenty houses such as "Guoxun" cannot afford to use newsprint and have switched to using local paper.</p>
<p>Although there seem to be so many newspapers and magazines in the wartime capital, and the prospect of operating them is so difficult, everyone is in good spirits. Everyone knows its mission and struggles hard. In the rear of the overall war of resistance, it has built a spiritual supply station, and it has contributed its due responsibility to the path to final victory. (Chongqing, 6th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Aggression League China Branch Exposes [Japanese] Ambitions: States that Landing in Hainan Has Direct Conflicts with Powers</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 14th] The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League has sent a telegram to the Geneva General Assembly, stating the fact of the Japanese military landing on Hainan Island and its serious impact. The telegram stated roughly, "This association wishes to notify all countries of the world, especially the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, that the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island intends to control the Gulf of Tokyo, so that Japan can surround the Philippines and cut off traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore. If a war occurs in the Pacific, Japan can resist the joint actions of the British and American navies. If Japan builds fortresses and enhances defenses on Hainan Island, then the power of the Japanese will expand to the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, Japan's invasion of Hainan Island is not another Sino-Japanese 'incident,' but part of the entire Pacific problem and has a direct relationship with some powerful countries. If the Japanese military resolutely occupies Hainan Island, then the entire international situation will inevitably change."</p>

<h3>Acknowledging the Spanish Rebel Army Issue: French Cabinet Meeting Discussed, With Lebrun Attending in Person. The British Steps Will Be Presented to Parliament.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the British government is in close contact with the French government regarding the recognition of the Franco government, but no decision has yet been made. A member of parliament asked whether Parliament should be guaranteed a discussion before any steps are decided. Chamberlain replied that the government would naturally be responsible. Chamberlain replied to other questions, stating that Senior Naval Officer Palma, a senior naval officer of the Spanish Rebel Army, admitted that the bombing of the British cruiser HMS Devonshire in Mahon Harbor was a violation of orders and expressed his deep apologies.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The French Cabinet held a meeting this morning under the personal chairmanship of Lebrun to discuss the issue of reversing the Franco government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet informed British Ambassador Phipps today that the French government's cabinet meeting will decide to recognize the Franco government in principle. However, legal recognition of the Franco government will be decided after the situation in Madrid has calmed down. In addition, Palada is now returning to Burgos to maintain diplomatic contact with the Franco government. The Spanish Republican government's ambassador to France visited French Foreign Minister Thérèse today to convey Prime Minister Negrin's note to France, stating that the Spanish Communist government has been re-established in Madrid.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Local political figures believe that the French cabinet will decide on the principle of recognizing the Franco government no later than tomorrow, and will send Bérard to Burgos again to exchange views again. Leftists will severely oppose the immediate and unconditional recognition. French citizens will also greatly oppose it. It is heard that the French government's recognition of Franco will include the transfer of the Spanish Embassy in Paris to the rebel envoys, the French government severing relations with the Madrid government, and the transfer of Spanish gold in France to Franco. According to the Paris Evening News, Franco will use the gold to pay off his German-Italian war debts. Everyone feels that the handling of the Spanish government army that has entered French territory will become a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>Spanish Government Forces Resolve to Defend Madrid to the Death</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Madrid, 13th] Today, the Spanish government authorities here distributed countless pamphlets with slogans, advising residents to defend Madrid to the death and not to retreat even a single soldier. All workers in the national defense industry are adding twelve hours of work each day. Even women and disabled soldiers are being conscripted to participate in defense work. All disabled soldiers are being re-examined, and those who are still able to serve in the military are being sent to the front for combat. Those who are semi-disabled are being hired as workers by various factories. Military experts have inspected the Madrid defense line and are preparing to set up new fortifications.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Perpignan, 12th] Barcelona reports that in the past 24 hours, the rebel army has occupied the Llivia area in northern Catalonia. The enemy has also been cleared west of Figueras, and more than two hundred trucks loaded with ammunition have been seized. It also stated that in the fifty days of the rebel army's attack on Catalonia, the government army's transportation on three sides has been cut off, and 110,000 people have been captured and over 30,000 have been killed or wounded. The rebel army currently has a military force of approximately 300,000, of which 80,000 are reserves. Reports from Madrid say that the lines are quite quiet, but rebel aircraft are constantly bombing Madrid and Valencia, causing heavy civilian casualties. The Spanish government army is now headquartered in Madrid and has resolved to continue the war of resistance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Burgos, 14th] The Spanish rebel army government recently issued a decree stating that its purpose is to prevent local authorities from taking retaliatory measures against the people under the jurisdiction of the current Republican government. The decree stipulates that local authorities may refer to the specific circumstances of each case when considering the provisions for punishment. According to the penalty rules, the government may confiscate all or part of the property of the parties concerned, and sentence them to imprisonment for three months to fifteen years.</p>
<h3>Senior U.S. Naval Officials Closely Watch the Large-Scale Exercises: Ships and Aircraft Sail to Designated Locations. Hull Refuses to Convene Disarmament Conference.</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Senior naval officers are currently closely watching the development of simulated warfare between the two fleets in large-scale exercises. The purpose of this exercise is entirely to test the navy's defensive strength. The Black Fleet, led by Admiral Gages, has secret orders to sail to the Atlantic Ocean and then attack the Panama Canal from there. The White Fleet, under the command of Admiral Andrews, is preparing to repel the above attack. However, because the exact direction of the attack is not yet known, it is necessary to conduct extensive reconnaissance, and even the coast of South America is included in the defense line, as the attackers may inevitably use it as a base for air operations. All the battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers, and submarines participating in the exercises departed from their bases at midnight on Sunday. It is said that it will take two or three days of sailing to reach the "battlefield" area. In this exercise, senior officials are trying to give both sides an equal opportunity to show their abilities. They will also go to sea on ships to observe the "battle" and calculate the points of victory or defeat for both sides. Heavy artillery exercises have been conducted in the past few days, and the results of the shooting will also be the result of the large-scale exercises. According to naval experts, this exercise is the first of its kind in American history, and its purpose is to check whether the national defense strength in the Western Hemisphere is sufficient.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The warships, aircraft, and submarines participating in the large-scale Atlantic naval exercise are heading to their designated locations. This exercise is very important. Roosevelt arrived at the exercise site to inspect the exercise. U.S. officials maintain extreme secrecy about this exercise and do not allow any journalists to visit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] Senator Parr proposed to the Senate to expand the national defense air force and start training 80,000 civil aviation personnel at the same time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The largest naval exercise in American history opened yesterday in the Caribbean Sea. 114 warships, 61,000 officers and soldiers, and 100 aircraft participated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] Democratic Congressman Lu Luli requested that the government convene an international disarmament conference. This proposal has been rejected by Secretary of State Hull, who believes that the international situation is such that it is not appropriate to take this step.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The Army and Navy Journal is the most authoritative publication for U.S. Army and Navy officers and soldiers. This issue of the weekly carries a full-page editorial, believing that the U.S. has legitimate reasons to allocate huge military expenditures. It is important to know that once the colonies of the United Kingdom and France fall into the hands of totalitarian countries, then the U.S. will have extremely difficult responsibilities in terms of national defense. If the British and French navies can always maintain their strength, then the U.S. will be absolutely safe, and any enemy will find it difficult to approach the U.S. border. If the British and French armies "fail," then the U.S. will become the target of attack by various totalitarian countries. Consider that if war breaks out again in Europe, who can say that the British and French armies will necessarily be safe? According to a special article by famous military reporter Colonel Palmer in the New York Times on the 22nd of last month, the U.S. is absolutely not afraid of any enemy ships approaching the U.S.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 14th] U.S. Admiral Huo Huochi recently gave a speech at the Mining and Metallurgical Engineers Society, stating that although the U.S. has begun to build 100 warships, including 6 battleships, and is actively expanding the air and ground forces, the U.S. strength is still not enough to cope with war. Huo Huochi pointed out that the obstacle to national defense expansion is that various manufacturing machines are not fully available. The government is now strongly urging factories to pay attention to this point. The countries of Europe and Asia spent 16 billion yuan on the arms race last year, but the U.S. will not be so "enthusiastic." The U.S. Army is also ranked nineteenth in the world, and the Navy is only ranked third. This is probably because we are not currently in danger of being invaded, but we must also prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates the Far East Issue: Members Are Dissatisfied with Japanese Aggression, and Dian-Burma Transportation Is Under Development.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] In the British House of Commons today, several questions concerning China were raised again for debate. Conservative MP Hanna asked about the relationship between the British Concession in Tianjin and the Japanese authorities there. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that regarding the various restrictions imposed by the Japanese on the movement of residents within the Concession under the pretext of preventing anti-Japanese activities, the local British Consul has sent a note to the Japanese authorities, and the British government has also sent a note to the Japanese government. He also said that the government will pay close attention to the situation there. Butler then replied to Conservative MP Moore-Brabazon, stating that the blockade of the Pearl River was first by the Chinese government, and after the fall of Guangzhou, it was by the Japanese government. The British government has protested to each government and will take all possible steps to achieve the opening of the Pearl River. Regarding the British government's negotiations with the Japanese government on British interests in the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Beining railways, Butler said that he reported this matter on December 21st of last year, and the situation has not changed. The question of what more effective methods will be adopted in the future is being re-examined. Moore Brabazon asked the Under-Secretary to pay attention to this matter, saying that it has been under consideration for several months since December 21st of last year. The Under-Secretary replied that he would pay close attention. He also answered other questions from Moore Brabazon. Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's restoration of its administrative rights in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas, the Municipal Council is negotiating with the local Japanese authorities. We are waiting for the results of their negotiations and do not want the government to negotiate directly with the Japanese for the time being. The Under-Secretary then replied to Conservative MP Marsden, saying that the British Consul-General in Shanghai has reported that there is little progress in organizing the Yangtze River Shipping Company. It is very doubtful whether the company currently has any ships. In other aspects, the situation on the Yangtze River has not changed. British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has sent another note to the Japanese government. Then Hanna asked whether the Japanese government does not allow the Joint Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan to sell foreign exchange to those who do not use Joint Reserve Bank banknotes. He asked the government to send another note to the Japanese government, stating that it is invalid to recognize counterfeit currency. The Under-Secretary replied that the government believes that sending such a note at this time will not achieve a useful purpose. Japan is now clear about the British government's view, that the issuance of inconvertible banknotes in North China is harmful to the interests of all trading countries. He said that he would keep this matter in mind.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] In the British House of Commons today, a member of parliament questioned the authorities about the transportation situation between Burma and India, what steps the government will take to improve the existing transportation, and what new transportation methods it will open. Under-Secretary for Indian and Burmese Affairs Colonel Muirhead reported on the situation of the new road from Lashio to Kunming. He also reported that only when the weather is clear can traffic pass through the section from Bhamo to that road. He also said that regarding the route from Bhamo to Tengchong, the government has agreed with the Chinese government to establish an air route between Burma and Kunming. The establishment of other routes is also under consideration. Labor MP Gilson asked whether these transportation routes are important in terms of military strategy and transportation since Japan occupied Hainan Island, and whether the government has considered ways to promote transportation convenience. Under-Secretary Muirhead said that this must be considered before a reply can be given.</p>
<h3>Britain's Note to Japan Has Not Yet Been Answered</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The British Foreign Secretary said during question time in the House of Commons today that the British government sent a note to the Japanese government on January 14th, stating that the British government cannot accept or recognize the situation changed by force. The Japanese government has not yet answered the note.</p>
<h3>Palestine Talks Continue; Jewish Delegation Issues Statement: The Fundamental Problem Lies in Residence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The Palestine Conference continued this morning. Colonial Secretary MacDonald and Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Butler jointly met with the Arab delegation. The theme of the meeting was to discuss the document presented by Pasha concerning the neighboring states of Palestine. According to well-informed sources, Pasha made efforts last week to reconcile the disputes between the two Arab parties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] The Jewish delegation to the Palestine Conference issued a statement today, saying, "The fundamental problem for Jews lies in having nowhere to live. We believe that the Jewish and Arab nations can find a mutually beneficial method to solve this problem. This method must be based on the League of Nations mandate system. The number of Jews immigrating to Palestine should be based on the region's economic capacity and absorptive capacity. The interests of minorities in Palestine should be effectively protected. Jews do not want to rule the Arabs, but they will never be ruled by the Arabs. As for the plan to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, it will take a long time to realize. The Arabs say that Palestine is an Arab country, but this is impossible to realize. Jews account for one-third of the population of Palestine, and their economic and cultural activities account for two-thirds. The construction work of Jews in Palestine in the past sixty years has been remarkable. The British government's plan to amend the mandate system to weaken the basic rights of Jews is beyond our expectations. The world must have a land for Jews to live in, where Jews can determine their own destiny and not be ruled by others. Palestine has become prosperous through the efforts of Jews for sixty years, with excellent agricultural and industrial conditions, and a Jewish society has been established. Palestine can now accommodate millions of refugees. If Palestine cannot accommodate all the refugees, it should still accommodate as many Jews as possible. We are extremely willing to reach an understanding with the Arabs. Although Palestine is a holy land for the Arabs, it is not a holy land for the British. The area has never been a center of civil development for the Arabs."</p>
<h3>U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Brandeis Resigns</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Brandeis, has now resigned. He is eighty years old and in poor health. He assumed this position on January 28, 1916. Brandeis was the first Jew to serve on the highest court.</p>
<h3>New German Battleship "Bismarck" Launched; Hitler Presides in Person</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hamburg, 14th] Germany recently built three 25,000-ton battleships. One of them was launched today. Hitler personally attended the ceremony. The ship was named "Bismarck," and Bismarck's granddaughter performed the naming ceremony. Hitler delivered a short speech praising Bismarck as the creator of the Second German Empire.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Passes Resolution Mourning the Pope</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The U.S. Congress adjourned until tomorrow. Both the Senate and the House passed resolutions expressing deep mourning for the Pope's death.</p>
<h3>Government Wins Majority in Czech Provincial Elections</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 13th] In the elections in the provinces of Kapes and Ukra, the government won a majority of 92%. 93% of voters were involved.</p>
<h3>Italy to Make Demands: Seeking Tunisia, Gibraltar, and Participation in Suez Canal Management; Italian Warships to Concentrate in Preparation for Any Eventuality</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 14th] According to diplomatic circles here, Mussolini may issue a public statement on the 19th, explaining Italy's natural inclinations to the world, especially regarding the Mediterranean and North Africa. Because of his successes in Spain, Mussolini is increasingly confident. The current statement may focus on the following three points: (1) Italy's population is rapidly increasing, and it is indeed necessary to reclaim Tunisia. (2) Italy urgently wants to participate in the management of the Suez Canal. (3) Gibraltar naturally belongs to Italy geographically in East Africa.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th] Italian officials announced that several Italian warships previously dispatched to patrol the Central American region have completed their mission and have decided to return to Italy and no longer advance westward. According to foreign naval observers, the sudden return of the Italian warships this time is due to the anti-fascist movements that have taken place in Central America. In addition, the Italian government, due to the serious international situation, urgently wants to concentrate Italian warships in Italian territorial waters in the shortest possible time in preparation for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>The Backing of Protest</h3>
<p>Japan's invasion of Hainan Island has effectively expanded the war of aggression against China into a major war for supremacy in the Pacific. Britain, France, and the United States are under serious threat. Therefore, it is inevitable that Britain, France, and the United States will protest against Japan. Yesterday, Britain followed France in protesting against Japan's occupation of Hainan Island.</p>
<p>However, verbal and written protests must have strong strength as backing in order to be effective. What is the backing for peaceful countries protesting against aggressors now? We saw the British Prime Minister's statement yesterday, after consulting with the French government, to jointly protect interests in the Far East. We also saw the fact of the U.S. Navy's exercises. Yes, only the unity and cooperation of peaceful countries, only the demonstration of military strength, is the most powerful backing for all protests. But there are also forces that we have not yet clearly recognized. The first is the power of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, and the second is the power of the international labor masses in Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Germany, and Italy in their anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggles. We must organize and unite these forces and coordinate them with our country's and Spain's struggles against aggression and for liberation in order to become the backing for protesting against fascist aggressors.</p>
<h3>The Spring Festival Has Arrived</h3>
<p>The Spring Festival has arrived, or, to put it bluntly, the Lunar New Year has arrived!</p>
<p>According to Chinese folk customs, the common people work hard day and night, and when the New Year comes, they take the opportunity to celebrate wildly through the rituals of worshiping gods and respecting heaven. From a human perspective, this is indeed not something to be criticized, and many praiseworthy reasons can be cited!</p>
<p>However, if we think about it, in such an unreasonable society, who really gets to celebrate wildly during the New Year? Isn't it those who are usually oppressed by heavy economic shackles and can't even catch their breath? If we think of our homeland under the bombardment of invaders' artillery fire, and our fields, houses, elders, sisters under the oppression and murder of invaders and traitors, we really have to wonder: whose is the New Year after all? Whose is the Spring Festival after all?</p>
<p>Wealthy people living in special areas, don't let yourselves forget your place in the earth-shattering sound of firecrackers, gongs, drums, and laughter! In order to protect eternal freedom, security, and happiness, everyone should save some consumption to dedicate to our motherland, to support our frontline soldiers, and to help our refugees in various places. The motherland, soldiers, and refugees are holding up their passionate hands to you. Don't lose your chance to make a glorious offering!</p>
<h3>Italy and Germany Sign Trade Agreement; France and Germany Also Hold Business Negotiations: Exchanging Coal and Iron, Selling Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 14th] According to the Italian official news agency, the Italian-German trade agreement was signed yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th] French-German business negotiations began yesterday. Germany's exchange of coal for French pig iron and the issue of the German market accommodating the sale of French agricultural products are the themes of the negotiations between the two sides.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Speaks on the Progress of the War of Resistance (Continued from Page 3)</h3>
<p>Eliminate Cultural Traitors</p>
<p>In the cultural field, we should strive to enhance the people's awareness of the war of resistance. This is an important task for cultural figures. But there is a kind of cultural figure who is a believer in national defeatism. We must guard against him. He specializes in spreading rumors and disseminating all kinds of deceptive fallacies that shake people's hearts. The fallacies of these defeatists are even more harmful than tangible traitors. I call these people "cultural traitors." We must eliminate them (applause) in order to establish our people's belief in resisting the war.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to report on the departure of Mr. Wang Jingwei. On this point, I want to make it clear that I am not attacking individuals. I am thinking for the country and the nation. Originally, Mr. Wang was a senior member of the Kuomintang, and I had a very good personal relationship with him. But the fact that he sought peace and left is obvious. I cannot but report it to everyone so that everyone has an understanding. Mr. Wang's seeking peace and leaving this time is a consistent policy of his advocacy of peace. After the fall of Nanjing, he advocated peace. After the fall of Wuhan, he sought peace again. This time, after the fall of Guangzhou, he sought peace even more actively. Before he left, he reported at the memorial week in Chongqing: He said: China must now seek peace. Today, I am here to say this. Even if someone takes a gun and shoots me three or even thirty times, I will still advocate peace. Everyone in Chongqing knows that he said this! Once, he asked me to visit Chairman Chiang. He also talked about peace and asked what I thought. I said: I am a soldier, and obedience is my duty. I don't know whether to seek peace or not. I will do whatever the supreme commander tells me to do. I am following the national policy of resisting the war. In history, I have never seen a country perish because of resisting the war. But people like Tao Xisheng have read history too chaotically, so they have their current behavior. Mr. Wang is a person suffering from a pro-Japanese disease. Every time he sees a victory on the front line, he is annoyed. When he sees a defeat on the front line, he is happy instead. When he was in Chongqing, he proposed five conditions for seeking peace. The recent telegrams are related to his considerable contact with X chief Konoe. In short, Mr. Wang is not a great statesman. If he were a great statesman, then, like Eden and Chamberlain in Britain, if their political views were not in harmony, they would frankly resign and stand aside without hindering others. Our current war of resistance is an established national policy, is the claim of the people, and it is also the resistance for peace, but the X have closed the door to peace. How can he advocate peace? Moreover, peace must be achieved on the basis of equality. How can unequal demands be peaceful? Furthermore, individuals cannot act alone and casually negotiate peace. At present, besides traitors, who else does not want to resist the war to survive? (Applause) Therefore, after Mr. Wang left, the pro-Japanese and moderate elements in Chongqing were uprooted. (Mulin)</p>
<h3>The New Crisis in Europe</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dong Ping</p>
<p>Original by Politicus. Adapted and translated from "Moscow News"</p>
<p>In London, groups of students paraded the streets with signs that read, "We Demand American Aid!"; in Montmartre, French crowds were gazing at Mount Vesuvius and shouting slogans; similarly, Roman parliamentarians, fascist cadres, and Mussolini's henchmen were loudly demanding "Corsica," "Nice," "Tunisia," and "Gibraltar"; in fact, such antics are all the same, simply making unreasonable demands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this world, democratic countries have failed to uphold a firm policy and force; therefore, the arrogance of fascism has grown increasingly intense; and Mussolini's demands have become a significant matter. Of course, no one has forgotten that Hitler did not demand the annexation of Austria without reason last year, and he got it. Nor was Czechoslovakia quietly handed over at Munich not long ago? None of these events were justified from a historical, national, or legal perspective.</p>
<p>Perhaps some might think: if Tunisia had never belonged to Italy, if Corsica had long been sold to France, if Nice had been generously ceded to France by King Victor Emmanuel I after a plebiscite in 1860, then these complications might not have arisen. But, would that be the case? Fascist aggressors rely entirely on their own rhetoric and would never honor treaties signed by their ancestors. Naturally, they would pay even less attention to the opinions of the people in those lands. All their actions are always determined by two questions: "Do we need it?" "Can we get it?"</p>
<p>Perhaps someone will ask, does Italy really want to seize these territories from France? Why not? If she could control Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia, she would completely dominate the western Mediterranean, establishing a close connection between her mainland and the naval bases in distant Sardinia and Pantelleria.</p>
<p>Similarly, Mussolini disregarded the agreement he signed with Laval in 1935—in which France agreed to return Doumerea to Italy on the condition that Italy would not make further demands—and demanded the return of Somaliland and Gibraltar. If Italy were to seize these two territories, Britain's defensive strength in Africa and Asia would immediately drop to zero. At present, Asia serves as an important base for British ships traveling to India and French ships traveling to Annam.</p>
<p>Can Italy get it? The answer to this question is also positive. Recent history provides clear evidence. And it leaves behind the best method for fascist aggressors to adopt. That method is: "No matter how much you want, use the threat of war to demand it, and you will always be able to return fully loaded from Chamberlain and Daladier. Even if they know that Fascist Italy's power is far inferior to that of Nazi Germany, they will still spare no effort to compromise and seek peace." So, demand and take whatever you want!"</p>
<p>Thus, with Germany's support, Italy has voiced its demands, demanding the division of French colonies and her mainland. After the Munich Conference, Daladier was smugly convinced that he had established peace in Europe. In an instant, he did not expect that Mussolini, who had been "in good spirits" with him not long ago, would come to trouble him. In a state of panic, he naturally had to seek help from Britain again. This time, Britain's attitude is unpredictable. Help the "traditional friend"? Or, like in Munich, give Germany a boost and also give Italy a hand?</p>
<p>Chamberlain did not stay in Rome for even forty-eight hours before quietly returning to England—(translator).</p>
<p>We cannot speculate on how Chamberlain "cultivated peace" with Mussolini in Rome, and it is unnecessary. He may have adopted the "cooperation" method, giving Italy the railway rights from Gibraltar to Addis Ababa. He may have advocated improving the treatment of Italians in Tunisia. He may have suggested helping Italy in securing an administrative right on the Suez Canal. He may have had many other methods. Naturally, Chamberlain would have bargained a lot in Rome, because at least he always knew that letting Italy gain less of an advantage was not only good for France, but also good for the British Empire. But undoubtedly, Chamberlain was still willing to come and discuss this deal. When a person does not simply say "no" but says, "Okay, let's discuss it": then things are somewhat promising. So, this time Mussolini will probably be able to get something from Chamberlain, unless Mussolini's appetite is too big.</p>
<p>Naturally, Mussolini's promises are worth zero. But Chamberlain had declared in the British Parliament that the Anglo-Italian agreement would not be implemented until the Spanish volunteers had withdrawn. But now? On the surface, Italy has withdrawn 9,000 volunteers—but has exchanged them for a larger and stronger contingent of fresh troops, who are catching up with the major offensive on the Catalan front, building a merit for Franco.</p>
<p>This fact naturally also made Chamberlain a little unhappy, but it was very subtle. Many people rumored that Britain, like Germany and Italy, was hoping for the early collapse of the Spanish government, which may not be entirely without reason. Recently, Britain has been brewing to recognize the rebels as belligerent groups (and is now brewing to legally recognize the Franco government—).</p>
<p>France's situation is of course extremely difficult. If Mussolini's demands are only one-tenth realized, the blow to France would be ten times greater than when she lost the barrier of Czechoslovakia. Therefore, he is now firmly declaring: never give up an inch of land. May she be able to keep this belief forever unchanged.</p>
<p>Everything now seems to be in a period of gathering clouds, but undoubtedly, the storm is coming soon. A new European crisis is upon us. At that time, we will see: what new ways will Italy use to invade? What means will France use to resist? And, who knows, is this not the fuse for World War II!</p>

<h3>Tung Wah Hospital Board Held Re-election Yesterday: 27 New Merchant Directors Elected; Letter Urging Selection of Retail Merchant Directors Has Been Sent; Zhou Zhao Wu Reports on the Progress of the Issue of Abolishing Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>The current term of the Directors of Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong for the year of Wu Yin (戌寅) expired on the first day of the eighth lunar month and have resigned according to precedent. In addition to the election of new Directors by the various trade associations, new Merchant Directors were also to be elected. Tung Wah Hospital specially held the election of new Merchant Directors for the year of Ji Mao (己卯) at the hospital auditorium at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, in order to hand over hospital affairs. More than ten people attended, including Zhou Zhao Wu, Lin Pei Sheng, Yang Yong Sheng, Lao Mian Nong, Luo Xian Sheng, Feng Wei Xuan, Xu Tie Ru, Kang Jing Bo, Yun Guan Zhan, Xu Li San, Huang Chi Pu, Tang Yi Tang, Chairman Zhou Zhao Wu, and Secretary Gong Jian Ming. It is heard that after the meeting, the secretary read the notice calling the meeting to order.</p>
<p>Chairman Announces the Reasons for the Election</p>
<p>The Chairman then announced the reasons for the meeting, stating that today is the date for Tung Wah Hospital to elect the new Merchant Directors for the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). The chair has been nominated by the local community to serve as chairman for the two years of the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China. At present, the country is facing a serious crisis, and the hospital's responsibilities have become even more onerous. The domestic war is still in a serious state, and the hospital's relief responsibilities cannot be terminated. Looking back over the past two terms, Dong et al. have been sincere and devoted to repaying the community. Although there have been no achievements, fortunately, the colleagues have had the same heart and mind, and the consultants have given timely instructions. Upon the expiration of his term, he will announce his resignation according to precedent, so that capable people can be elected to continue the hospital's affairs. In recent years, the hospital has been affected by the economic downturn, making it difficult for each session to find capable people to succeed. The reasons are that the burden on the three hospitals is increasing day by day. However, past predecessors have pioneered the sources of income, and the hospital's expenditures and reforms have all been put on track. It is expected that the next capable people will be able to display their talents. Considering the current financial difficulties of the three hospitals, the Hong Kong government is concerned and is doing its best to maintain them. Therefore, the directors of the three hospitals are only required to contribute their talents to seek happiness for the community and the endless stream of refugees. The remaining financial problems can be observed at any time and addressed according to the environment. This section is sincerely to comfort the new directors. The chair knows that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are all patriotic and enthusiastic. It is hoped that the new directors elected by you will regard the current relief work of the hospital as their own responsibility, each contribute their talents, and also serve the country. As for the next retail merchant directors, the hospital has sent a letter urging them, sincerely hoping that each trade association will nominate the new directors in the short term, etc.</p>
<p>A Total of 27 New Directors</p>
<p>After Lao Mian Nong briefly delivered a speech, the election of Merchant Directors for the year of Ji Mao (己卯) began. The process went smoothly, and a list of candidates was approved, totaling 27 people. A total of 9 current directors were re-elected. Observers said that Yang Yongkang is the most popular candidate for the position of chairman. The list is as follows: Chen Youfu, Yang Yongkang, Han Runlin, Ma Zewen, Kuang Xiang, Chen Bocheng, Kuang Baotian, Ruan Weiyang, Zhou Guan Nian, Chen Lanfang, Lin Zheng Feng, Lao Yingqun, Lin Shao Dong, Wu Ren Huai, Luo Xian Sheng, He Zhaoji, Wu Yi Sun, Xie Yuchun, Zhou Shiyuan, Chen Zhenhua, Lao Mian Nong, Wei Wenwei, Deng Wentian, Jiang Yutang, Zou Jieren, Zhou Chengtai, Tang Yi Tang.</p>
<p>Abolishing Traditional Chinese Medicine Was Not Hastily Implemented</p>
<p>Zhou Zhao Wu then gave a written report on the discussions with the authorities regarding the issue of whether to retain or abolish the traditional Chinese medicine physicians of the three hospitals, stating that the hospital's negotiations with the government on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine are a matter of concern to all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, and also a matter of national essence. The brother has been serving as chairman of the three hospitals for two years and has long anticipated that the expenses of the three hospitals would increase day by day. After taking office, he immediately drew up a budget and requested assistance from the government for the annual deficit. The brother deeply feels that the government empathizes with the situation. The government has already accepted and allocated assistance for the previous deficit of more than 150,000 yuan, and has also agreed to increase the subsidy by 30,000 yuan per year in the future, that is, the annual subsidy for the three hospitals will increase to 121,000 yuan, and has also agreed to subsidize the annual deficit. However, when requesting subsidies for the deficit, the authorities put forward several conditions, one of which was the issue of retaining or abolishing traditional Chinese medicine. Our colleagues believe that this is a serious matter. According to the medical superintendent, they wanted to abolish traditional Chinese medicine. Our colleagues, in order to maintain the status of the three hospitals and for the sake of the national essence, argued strongly. The brother asked the authorities whether they recognized the Tung Wah Hospital as an independent organization of overseas Chinese, and whether the government should provide various forms of assistance to public welfare undertakings. The authorities understood the importance of the issue and did not hastily implement it. Today, the brother announces the result of this issue, fearing that rumors will spread. However, I believe that all parties will read the newspaper and also know that in the previous Legislative Council session, the advanced member Sir Brook questioned the issue of the Tung Wah Hospital's management responsibilities. The Colonial Secretary, Mr. Mei, replied as usual, with no change. From this, it can be seen that the authorities have a clear attitude towards the three hospitals. During the brother's two terms, the authorities provided various forms of assistance, which is deeply appreciated. The brother is about to step down, but because of the importance of the Tung Wah Hospital in the current national crisis, I sincerely hope that our enthusiastic fellow countrymen will always maintain it, and create the ambition of the three hospitals, and forever protect the three hospitals as the only independent charitable organization of our overseas Chinese. The meeting adjourned until after 5:00 p.m. It was found that the 27 Merchant Directors who were elected will be sent letters of appointment by Tung Wah Hospital within the next few days to formally assume their posts.</p>
<h3>各界賑聯會昨議決　自設辦難民習藝所　即席通過習藝所組織及規程</h3>
<p>The Joint Relief Committee of All Circles Resolved Yesterday to Establish a Refugee Vocational Training Center on Its Own, and Immediately Approved the Organization and Regulations of the Vocational Training Center</p>
<p>香港各界　濟華民難　聯席會、昨日下午三時、座華商總會四樓、召開第三十六次大會、是日出席者有各社團代表多人、列席者有醫藥組監司徒永覺夫人、由新會商會代表周星池主席、</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Joint Relief Committee for Chinese Refugees held its 36th General Meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday on the 4th floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Many representatives from various organizations attended, including Mrs. Situ Yongjue, supervisor of the medical team. The meeting was chaired by Zhou Xingchi, representative of the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>報告事項</p>
<p>Report Items</p>
<p>開會後、首由司徒永覺夫人執吿中國工業合作協會工作之近况、大意謂、該在中國已有一年歷史、政府經撥巨欵五百萬元、以爲設立經費、生產機關、必需在原料出產豐富之地、故中國政府已預備多做此種工業合作社于西北西南等各省、最近更擬在粤北設一分社、就地取材製造物品、港方並非原料　產地、且製成品　入內地、頗覺困難，且香港政府亦未預算長期收容難民、不過急則治標、暫時安頓、故習藝所實宜設於内地、希望賑聯會對於此點、加以注意云、繼由財務部報吿去週支納數目、由民廿八年二月七日起、至二月十三日止、（港幣）進陽商會五—元、接上共進一十萬零四十八百二十九元三毫二仙、支總部五千元、接上共支九萬零零九十九元三毫一仙、比對尙存一萬四千七百三十元、（國幣）是週無進支、接上週存六萬一千二百三十元零九分、（餘略）</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Mrs. Situ Yongjue first reported on the recent developments of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Association, stating that it had been in existence in China for a year, with the government allocating a huge sum of five million yuan for its establishment. Production facilities need to be located in areas with abundant raw materials. Therefore, the Chinese government is preparing to establish more of these industrial cooperatives in the northwestern and southwestern provinces, and recently plans to establish a branch in northern Guangdong to manufacture goods using local materials. Hong Kong is not a raw material production area, and it is quite difficult for manufactured goods to enter the mainland. Furthermore, the Hong Kong government has not budgeted for long-term refugee accommodation, but only for temporary relief in emergencies. Therefore, vocational training centers should be established in the mainland. She hoped that the Relief Committee would pay attention to this point. The finance department then reported on the number of expenditures and receipts for the past week, from February 7th to February 13th of the 28th year of the Republic (Hong Kong dollars): the Jinyang Chamber of Commerce contributed 50 yuan, bringing the total income to 100,4829 yuan, 3 jiao and 2 fen. 5,000 yuan was disbursed to the headquarters, bringing the total expenditure to 90,099 yuan, 3 jiao and 1 fen, leaving a balance of 14,730 yuan.

<h3>海口海關　被×強佔　廣東輪今開往</h3>
<p>Haikou Customs Occupied by the Enemy; Guangdong Ship to Sail Today</p>
<p>海口陷落、該地我國海關，有被×强　壓迫、該關稅務司史蔑夫交出所有文件消息、記者昨向此間我國海關叩詢、據發言人答稱、日軍强佔海口海關、信必有其事、本人料日軍佔港口後、其對于海口海關、與日軍佔　上海、南京、廣州、厦門等地時所取手段相同、可無疑問、故彼間情形、準此可測知、本人從可靠方面得悉、海口海關人員、現尙安全、現此間無直接消息云、又據中國電報局訊、香港與海口電報，自昨十一日巳不能通訊云、故此間相信、我軍將電機自動炸毁、或×軍將海口電報强佔、都在意中、故一切訊悉間絕、又據　古輪船公司華經理莫慶鏘謂，太古輪仍照常行走該　、今午有廣，號　開往彼間云、</p>
<p>Haikou has fallen. It has been reported that our customs office there has been oppressed by the enemy and that the customs commissioner, Smith, has handed over all documents. Reporters inquired with our customs office here yesterday. According to a spokesperson, it is certain that the Japanese army has occupied the Haikou Customs. It is expected that after the Japanese army occupies the port, their treatment of the Haikou Customs will be the same as their methods when occupying Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Xiamen and other places. There is no doubt about this. Therefore, the situation there can be inferred accordingly. I learned from reliable sources that the personnel of the Haikou Customs are currently safe. There is currently no direct news here. According to a report from the China Telegraph Administration, telegrams between Hong Kong and Haikou have been unable to communicate since the 11th yesterday. Therefore, it is believed here that our army automatically destroyed the motors or the enemy army forcibly occupied the Haikou telegram, which are both expected, so all news is cut off. According to Mo Qingqiang, the Chinese manager of the Taikoo Steampship Company, Taikoo ships are still sailing as usual. The "Guang" ship will sail there this afternoon.</p>
<h3>衛生局昨會議　司徒永覺解答　肺癆列入傳染症理由　醫師須呈報藉知實情　預防步驟將按步實施</h3>
<p>Health Bureau Meeting Yesterday: Situ Yongjue Explains Reasons for Listing Tuberculosis as a Contagious Disease; Doctors Must Report to Understand the Facts; Preventive Measures to be Implemented Step by Step</p>
<p>市政衛生局、昨午四時十五分、召集會議、出席者托特（主席）司徒永覺（副主席）工勝司幹德臣、華民政務司嘉利、警察司經享利周錫年譚雅士等、開會如儀後、主席托特首向周錫年氏致賀、聯任該　議員、繼譚雅士　問、關于肺癆症被宣佈列入傳染症事、請主席解　三點、（一）港政府採取此項步驟之理由、（二）港政府所擬採行處置此項疾病之辦法、（三）是否將實施關于傳染病之一九三六年禁海及預防疾病條例規定、特別是九一三六年第七號則例第三款關于消毒隔離檢視及拘禁之規定、</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau convened a meeting at 4:15 PM yesterday. Attendees included Todd (Chairman), Situ Yongjue (Vice Chairman), Gong Shengsi Gande Chen, Huamin Political Affairs Secretary Carli, Police Secretary Jing Henry Zhou Xinian Tan Yashi, etc. After the meeting began as usual, Chairman Todd first congratulated Mr. Zhou Xinian on his reappointment as a member of the council. Then Tan Yashi asked about the declaration of tuberculosis as a contagious disease, and asked the chairman to explain three points: (1) The reasons why the Hong Kong government took this step; (2) The measures the Hong Kong government plans to take to deal with this disease; (3) Whether the provisions of the 1936 Ordinance on the Prohibition of the Sea and Prevention of Diseases concerning infectious diseases will be implemented, especially Article 3 of Regulation No. 7 of 1936 concerning disinfection, isolation, inspection and detention.</p>
<p>肺病列入　傳染理由</p>
<p>Reasons for Listing Tuberculosis as a Contagious Disease</p>
<p>由醫藥總監司徒，永覺代表答覆，（第一項）因肺癆爲流行本港死症之一。去年統計、居民死于是症奢達九千餘人、在公衆衛生立塲、欲確知該問題之廣闊、非調查息病者之實數、實無從措乎、列肺癆爲頒行通吿傳染症、實欲使註册醫師、必須將到診之肺癆　者呈報政府、使衞生當局得以調査其年齡、性別、听傳染疾、　其營養居屋及衛　、狀况、俾從中尋求辦　、以遏止此症之　染、同時使衛生當局得以决定採取何種步驟以隔離病人、及施行醫藥檢驗、與屋宇消毒、以滅　該症之傳染、</p>
<p>Situ Yongjue, the Director of Medical and Health Services, replied on behalf of the government: (1) Because tuberculosis is one of the common deadly diseases in Hong Kong. According to statistics last year, more than 9,000 residents died from this disease. From a public health standpoint, in order to know the extent of the problem, it is necessary to investigate the actual number of patients. Listing tuberculosis as a declared infectious disease is intended to require registered physicians to report tuberculosis patients who come to their clinics to the government, so that the health authorities can investigate their age, gender, source of infection, nutritional status, housing and sanitary conditions, in order to find ways to curb the spread of this disease. At the same time, it enables the health authorities to decide what steps to take to isolate patients, implement medical examinations, and disinfect houses to eliminate the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>政府施行　預防步驟</p>
<p>Government Implements Preventive Measures</p>
<p>（第二項）至于政府擬採行何種辦法、此時言之未免過星、有待于實施呈報後所得結果、始能决定、現所可言者、如委任專員處理肺癆事件　　建設肺癆病院、及拆除發生該症特多之稠陋民居等、皆在可能施行範圍內（第三項）關於實施禁海及防止疾病例則、視病人之環境而定、如設法防止傳染他人、病人所處之黃精、決定屋宇應否實施消毒、醫治病人方法、醫院中應有設備是也、權由主席宜佈下次會期、展　至三月二日舉行、此次申請發給牌照者六宗、均議决不准、最後宣讀各項衛生報吿畢，遂散會云、</p>
<p>(2) As for what measures the government plans to take, it is too early to say at this time. It will be decided after the results of the report are implemented. What can be said now is that appointing a commissioner to deal with tuberculosis events, building tuberculosis hospitals, and demolishing densely populated houses where the disease occurs frequently are all within the scope of possible implementation. (3) Regarding the implementation of the Sea Ban and Disease Prevention Regulations, it depends on the patient's environment, such as finding ways to prevent transmission to others, the patient's environment, deciding whether to disinfect the house, methods of treating patients, and the equipment that should be available in the hospital. The chairman announced the next meeting date, which was postponed to March 2. All six applications for licenses this time were rejected. Finally, after reading out the various health reports, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>×犯海口影響　柴價又將高漲　農歷年關海防柴又告斷絕</h3>
<p>Enemy Invasion of Haikou Affects Firewood Prices, Which Will Rise Again; Haiphong Firewood Supply Cut Off Again at the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>日前柴荒危機、　巳渡過消息、遍見本港報端、居民聆訊、無不額手稱慶、向例每屆殘冬、居民多預先購貯大批柴薪、以防價格高漲、惟自危機渡過消息傳出後、乃皆存觀望之心、不敢多購、以俟其價格低降、故日來柴薪囘情呆滯異常、記者昨晤某柴商、據謂柴薪價格暫時實無市跌希望、以坡柴與海防柴兩種言之、其所含水份實不相上下、如坡柴之發行價爲每元約八十斤、則海防柴價最多亦僅可得多數斤而已、至若零　價格、坡柴每元約可購五十餘斤、海防柴約六十斤左右、又據另一柴商言、海防柴運港、最近頗見活躍、然自去週瓊崖吿警、來源頓絕、對本港柴薪市塲、不　影嚮之處、逆料短期内，柴薪價格、不獨不能平復、新年以後、市價當當高漲云、</p>
<p>The news that the firewood shortage crisis had passed has been widely reported in Hong Kong newspapers. Residents were all celebrating. It is customary for residents to purchase and store large quantities of firewood in advance every winter to prevent prices from rising. However, since the news that the crisis had passed, everyone has been waiting and seeing, and dare not buy too much, waiting for the price to drop. Therefore, the firewood market has been extremely sluggish in recent days. A reporter met with a firewood merchant yesterday. According to him, there is no hope for a drop in firewood prices in the short term. Taking the two types of firewood, Po firewood and Haiphong firewood, the moisture content is about the same. If the issue price of Po firewood is about 80 catties per dollar, then the price of Haiphong firewood can only be a few catties more at most. As for the retail price, you can buy about 50 catties of Po firewood for one dollar, and about 60 catties of Haiphong firewood. According to another firewood merchant, the transportation of Haiphong firewood to Hong Kong has been quite active recently, but since Qiongya issued a warning last week, the source has been cut off, which has affected the Hong Kong firewood market. It is expected that in the short term, firewood prices will not only not recover, but will also rise after the New Year.</p>
<h3>農歷新年內　全日供水　由十七日至十九日</h3>
<p>Full-Day Water Supply During Lunar New Year, From the 17th to the 19th</p>

<p>On the 12th of this month, cargo ship No. 632 was carrying a large number of livestock and food from the Chinese border to Hong Kong. At 4:30 PM that afternoon, it arrived at the sea near Guo Zhou near Po Toi Island and suddenly encountered a robber boat carrying five pirates, all armed with pistols, who ordered it to stop. The people on the cargo boat saw that the situation was not good, and they rowed away in an attempt to avoid the robbery, which angered the robbers, who opened fire. Bullets rained down, and a boat companion, Mr. Jia, was injured by a stray bullet, bleeding profusely and falling into the boat. His boat companions, seeing the fierce banditry, had to stop advancing. The robber boat quickly caught up, swarmed over, threatened all the companions, and transferred all the 47 live pigs, 150 chickens, and 12 baskets of eggs they were carrying to their boat and left. After the robbers left, the cargo boat sailed to Hong Kong. The boat owner, Wang Naicheng (37 years old), went to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station to report the case and sent the injured person to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. The loss from this robbery amounted to several hundred yuan.</p>

At 11:00 AM on the (12th), when sailing to the Ma Zhou waters opposite Chi Wan, a robber boat suddenly came head-on. There were five robbers on the boat, who shouted loudly for Yu's boat to stop and raised their guns as if to bombard it. Yu obeyed the order to stop. Later, the robber boat approached and docked next to the boat. The three robbers holding pistols jumped over to Yu's boat and forced Yu and others to drive the boat near. Yu also cleverly obeyed and landed on the shore. Unexpectedly, the robbers Tong Erqiang forced Yu and others to go ashore, and then drove Yu's boat away. Yu's boat can carry 153 piculs and is worth 100 yuan. The department's police officer has recorded the case and is investigating according to the information provided.</p>

<h3>香港兒童保育院</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Children's Care Home</p>
<p>去年九月九日的夜晚，九龍車站來到了由漢口出發的二百四十五名難童，因此籌備了相當的時日的，中國戰時兒童保育會，香港分會的兒童保育院，立即充實起來，由於港地人口日增，尋找適合的院址，這是困難，幸虧院長何艾齡博士，各方奔忙，得到當地政府及各團體的援助，借得國家醫院暫用。這批從炮彈逃出，又經過長途跋涉的孩子們，總算有了歸宿。</p>
<p>On the night of September 9th last year, 245 refugee children from Hankou arrived at Kowloon Station. The Children's Care Home of the Hong Kong Branch of the China Wartime Children's Care Association, which had been in preparation for some time, was immediately filled. Due to the increasing population in Hong Kong, finding a suitable location for the home was difficult. Fortunately, the director, Dr. He Ailing, worked hard and received assistance from the local government and various organizations to borrow the National Hospital for temporary use. This group of children who escaped from the bombs and traveled a long distance finally had a home.</p>

<h3>International Sympathy for Our Students Deprived of Education; Secretary of the World Student Christian Federation, Miss Tomlin, Dispatched to China to Inspect and Provide Relief; Miss Tomlin Has Arrived in Hong Kong and Set Off for Chongqing Yesterday; Fundraising for Student Relief in Europe and America Has Reached US$100,000</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since the outbreak of war, × has been vigorously destroying our nation's cultural institutions. Countless schools in various regions have been destroyed by ×'s bombs and cannons, causing students in our war zones to be displaced and unable to seek education. Their plight is beyond description. People from all walks of life deeply sympathize with these young people deprived of education. In addition to the Student Mutual Aid Society and the Far Eastern Student Relief Association jointly organizing the National Student Relief Association with the Student Department of the National YMCA to specialize in providing relief to displaced students in various regions, the World Student Christian Federation has also worked hard to help. Last year, it raised US$53,000 to provide practical assistance to Chinese students. However, due to the complexity of relief efforts, this was merely a drop in the bucket. Therefore, a decision was made to continue fundraising. It is planned to raise US$94,760 this year. The organizations responsible for fundraising include the Far Eastern Student Emergency Committee in the United States, and the International Student Service Organization in Europe. It is reported that the funds raised so far have reached US$18,000. Fundraising in Europe totals 160,000 Swiss francs, equivalent to US$35,000. International student groups participating in this fundraising campaign include the Roman Catholic Student Association, the World Union of Jewish Students, and the International Student Federation. The domestic organizations in China managing this international fundraising effort are the National Student Relief Committee, jointly organized by the YMCA and YWCA, and the International Student Donation Management Committee, chaired by Mr. Zhang Boling. Recently, the donations received by these two organizations have reached over 100,000 yuan. In addition to initiating fundraising to provide relief to our nation's students, the World Student Christian Federation has specially dispatched Miss Tomlin, the secretary of the federation, from Geneva via the United States to China to inspect the mainland in order to determine relief plans. According to reports, Miss Tomlin arrived in Hong Kong on the 10th of this month aboard the Empress of Russia, and inquired about the affairs of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association, organized by the local YMCA. After a brief stay in Hong Kong, Miss Tomlin set off for Chongqing yesterday, the 13th. The main task of Miss Tomlin's visit to China is to attend the National YWCA Training Conference, which will open on the 6th of next month, where she will give a three-week lecture. After the conference, she plans to travel around mainland China, inspecting student organization centers in various regions in detail in order to collect rich materials and formulate effective relief plans upon her return to Europe.

<h3>The Philippine Interport Football Team Arrives in Hong Kong Yesterday; Hong Kong Interport Team to Hold Practice Match with Hong Kong League Team Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The much-anticipated Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Match, a first-of-its-kind event, is finally about to take place. This weekend at 3:30 PM, the two teams will officially meet at the Navy Ground.</p>
<p>The Philippine team, led by Mr. Carl, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning on the SS Lyemun and checked into the Astor House Hotel. In the afternoon, the entire team drove to the South China Stadium in Happy Valley for a light practice.</p>
<p>The reporter met with Mr. Carl at Happy Valley. In the conversation, he said, "Our football movement has a shallow history, and in the past, we rarely sent teams abroad to compete and seek technical improvement. On the contrary, Hong Kong teams such as South China have come to our country almost once a year in the past decade to provide guidance, which has gradually improved the technical level of our football. Therefore, our football community regards Hong Kong teams as a benefactor. This time, we are honored to be invited by the Hong Kong Football Association to Hong Kong for the interport match. However, our team is a junior and is visiting your country for the first time. We hope that people in Hong Kong will not dislike our team's poor skills and will give us guidance. It is a great honor. There are fifteen players in this trip. However, two starters were unable to come at the last minute, so two other players were selected to replace them. During the voyage, the wind and waves were quite strong, and everyone felt uncomfortable. "</p>
<p>According to Mr. Carl, the lineup for this weekend's (19th) interport match is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Yao E (La Salle College), Ba Qigao (Letran), W. Miranda (La Salle College)</p>
<p>Neil Du (YCO Club), Yao Jidi (La Salle College), Wallace (La Salle College)</p>
<p>Bitch (YCO Club), Bao Yangli (YCO Club), Lala Salbilu (Captain, La Salle College), Hillit Da (La Salle College), Lithas (La Salle College)</p>
<p>Substitutes: Na Feilu, Xiang Nanadis, Jia Balashi, Zhang Lannuhua</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Interport team will hold a practice match at the Navy Ground at 5:00 PM today, with the Hong Kong League team as their sparring partner. Tickets are uniformly priced at two corners. The Hong Kong League lineup has been finalized, so it is slightly different from what was published in yesterday's newspaper. The two lineups are recorded as follows: (Dong Lang)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Interport Team)</p>
<p>Tan Junqian (South China)</p>
<p>Shi Han (Middlesex), Li Tiansheng (South China)</p>
<p>Liang Rongzhao (South China), Dickson (Navy), Hannivelu (Navy)</p>

<p>Hong Kong League Team</p>

<h3>Welcome Philippine Football Friends (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>In recent years, they have strived for in-depth study and continuous progress. Schools have also paid more attention to it than before, so that the famous Shanghai general "Sai Li" went south to personally guide and inspire the younger generation, which has made considerable progress. The results were once amazing. Last year, they defeated the Gothenburg team in Hong Kong and the Eastern team. After Ai Lushi of the Army was hired to the south, he was also criticized several times. It is easy to imagine their strength. Their only advantage is "high speed", and their dribbling skills are also comparable to those of our country. The goalkeeper, because of basketball training, has produced many outstanding talents. If they do not have unique skills, it is not easy to break through their last barrier. Unfortunately, the Philippines does not have football referees of a certain level. The visiting team always suffers a little in the Philippines. They also know the point. Last year, they wrote to the Hong Kong Referees Association to send people to the Philippines to guide and explain fouls (no one from Hong Kong responded), which shows their great desire to learn and their spirit of humbly seeking advice, which are worthy of our admiration and praise.</p>
<p>In short, this Philippine team has come to Hong Kong to fight with strong people and horses. It is not the old Yang Bu A Meng. Although people are tired and avoid work, they should be careful and not take it lightly. You should know that they are mostly young calves who are not afraid of tigers. Our experience and skills may have a slight advantage, but "high speed" is their principle and goal. Technical problems must be secondary in this type of Cup-Tie championship. If we do not deal with it calmly and cautiously, I am afraid that we will repeat the mistakes of losing to the Shanghai team the year before last in an occasional negligence. I firmly believe that they have considerable preparation, considerable determination, and have undergone strict training, and will definitely have wonderful performances to satisfy the eyes of Hong Kong people. Their different attacks, defenses, advances and retreats, and strategies will definitely refresh the taste buds of the fans. I would like to say to the football public, who have always held the demeanor of scholars, please prepare applause to welcome them from the perspective of appreciators and with the doctrine of being good at praising those who are not capable, and wait quietly for the opening of the good show.</p>
<p>Before I put down my pen, I would like to offer a heartfelt wish to the new and old football friends from the Philippines, and wish them a pleasant journey and a happy journey! (End)</p>
<h3>Looking Back and Looking Forward</h3>
<p>— Lai Duanfu</p>
<p>This time, the Shanghai University Students Tennis Team, with its fearless spirit, came to Hong Kong to learn from the advanced players with their rapidly improving skills, and achieved a record of two wins and three losses, which seems rare. However, I hope that the players will not be complacent because of this, because they only defeated Dashi Tang and the Western Club, which are not very famous in the tennis world in Hong Kong. In reality, I can only say that Li Guopan's tennis skills are good, and Shuba Jiabei is good at strength. His techniques and footwork need to be improved. The remaining three are all in their infancy and can only hope to make a name for themselves after several years of training. I heard that the players will take the French mail ship President Shemei back to Shanghai at noon today. I will send them a gift when they return to Shanghai to work hard.</p>
<p>Jia won over Li Guofan in Shanghai. I think this may be because Li took a steady approach and only used the resilience of baseline shots, and did not study the net attack method, so he could not stand Tang's bold attack. I criticize tennis skills and always pay attention to caution, so there are few mistakes. It is necessary to improve Tang's techniques and footwork. Naturally, he can be as skilled as Li today. If Li studies the net attack method in the future and still cannot win against Tang, I dare to conclude that there is no such reason.</p>
<p>On Saturday and Sunday, South China South finally defeated Xianglu Kowloon Club by two to one and entered the semi-finals, which made domestic fans happy. The reason why they did not win before and finally won after three battles is that the third time they started their best players. However, I think the focus is not so simple. The first reason is that Feng Jingxiang suddenly has a strong impact and Wei Douwen can slightly change the disadvantage of "more dribbling and less passing". Secondly, he can promptly use the fearless Zhang Rongcai as the goalkeeper. This time, the coach has made great contributions. In the future, if he encounters a stubborn team with good charge, Zhang Rongcai is an indispensable person.</p>
<p>It can be said that the police club is extremely lucky to have narrowly defeated St. Joseph's, which had no comparable players on the field, to win the special silver medal in the Group A football finals. The reason for their victory is not due to the Western players, but to the three Chinese generals, Chen, Fan and Huang. In my observation, if Fan Guicai can concentrate on the game, then with this height and technique, he will become a famous general in the future. Huang Wenzhi's right wing performance is also a talented player. Chen Guangyu is slightly stiff in the waist and does not turn well. Otherwise, he is also a top-notch person. In the future, if these three players can work hard on their skills in the finals with the Chinese team, they will be respected by their compatriots.</p>
<p>In the friendly match between the selected team and the Hong Kong League team last Thursday, the selected team performed poorly. Fu La is not a right winger at all, and his performance is much inferior to that of Deng Guangsen, who has made rapid progress. Gao Shannu is obviously not used to being a left inside forward. Yu Han and Han Nivelu did not perform well. Shi Han is far inferior to Hou Rongsheng, and Han Nivelu even lost to Little Stulland. Li Tiansheng and Liang Rongzhao were forcibly switched positions, and they did not perform their true colors. I am worried about fighting a strong team from afar with this. Fortunately, the Philippine team is not very strong, or each individual's skills still have hope of winning. I still think the strongest Hong Kong team today should be as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Junqian (South China)</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng (South China), Newby (Navy)</p>
<p>Bello Du (St. Joseph's), Xu Cheng (Eastern), Liang Rongzhao (South China)</p>
<p>Hou Chengtou (Eastern), Feng Jingxiang (South China), Li Huitang (South China), Gao Shannu (St. Joseph's), Armstrong (Army)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Philippine selected team arrived. I saw them practice at Caroline Hill. Most of the players are not tall and their shots are not very strong. This may be due to the appearance after a long journey. However, I am not weak in vision. If you compare the characters, unless there is very good coordination, you can be better than others. Although the characters of the Hong Kong selected team are wrongly arranged, but the players are experienced, they should still have hope of winning. The China Federation team and the Hong Kong Federation team are very likely to win, because the China Federation is too good, and the Hong Kong Federation's forwards are all capable members, so they are more likely to win than the selected team.</p>
<p>Today, the Hong Kong selected team was originally scheduled to have a practice match with the Navy and Army United team, but the Navy and Army could not send a team due to something. Yesterday, the General Assembly has selected another Hong Kong League team to fight (see section for the list), which is also quite strong. It will still be held at the Navy Stadium at 5:00 PM as scheduled (not on Friday as rumored). Admission tickets are uniformly priced at two dimes. The Philippine team is scheduled to practice there from 4:00 PM. If you buy tickets early and enter the venue, you will have a double dose of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Li Huitang is called a genius in the football world, and he also has considerable tennis skills. Moreover, he is well-versed in both Chinese and English. He is a prodigy. This is known to everyone. I have not seen much extravagance, but after seeing his warm welcome to the Philippine team, I can't help but admire him. However, there is still one man of both literary and military talent in the football world who is not yet known, and is also worth introducing. Goalkeeper Tan Junqian, is also good at English, is currently serving in the Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Corps, studying military knowledge, and is also quite accomplished in Chinese. He can write Northern Wei script and write small poems. He is also extraordinary. He and Huitang work together at the Swedish foreign company, and there is a record that the two have never lost on the same field. They can be called the "two difficulties" in the football world.</p>
<p>The vigorous and energetic Eastern Group A football team was originally scheduled to compete with the Navy team on Saturday. The Eastern team took advantage of the victory over South China South, and their momentum swallowed the mountains and rivers. They could even sweep away the Navy team and advance hand in hand with South China South towards the championship. However, the Navy team was too alert and asked to postpone the game. The Lunar New Year's Eve was not able to see that good show. However, according to the recent change in the schedule, the Eastern team will play against Middlesex that day. The Middlesex army is also a strong team, and it is also worth seeing. However, the Middlesex army has no hope of winning the championship, and the interest is not as high as fighting the Navy. However, there is still a Group A League match between Scott and St. Joseph's before the match, which will be closed at 2:30 PM. Since there are exciting games to watch, fans should also actively support the event.</p>
<p>The Philippine team chartered a ship to come this time. Many of the companions are Philippine fans who came to see Li Huitang and Gao Shannu, and are now staying at the Astor House Hotel, where the Philippine team is stationed.</p>
<h3>International Skating Finnish Champion</h3>

<h3>Film and Theater</h3>
<p>Entertainment... Troublesome Cupid</p>
<p>Love Is A Headache</p>
<p>This is a worn-out Hollywood romantic comedy. The story lacks appeal, the actors lack well-rounded performances, and the development of each plot point seems forced and unnatural.</p>
<p>The film depicts a Broadway star who, for publicity, reluctantly adopts two mischievous children. Although the two children cause her much trouble, they ultimately allow the pampered diva to experience maternal love. It also depicts a newspaper editor who deeply admires the diva but strongly opposes her publicity stunts, and the various jokes that arise between them.</p>
<p>Franchot Tone and Gladys George both work hard, but without great success. Barton MacLane's performance in this film, although not as brilliant as in films like "Judge Hardy's Family," is still passable.</p>
<p>Queen... A Slight Case of Murder</p>
<p>A Slight Case of Murder</p>
<p>Although this film is themed around bandits, it is full of humor, wit, and satire. The story depicts a group of cold-blooded murderers, but the impression given to the audience is not one of terror and tension, but rather one of lighthearted comedic fun.</p>
<p>Edward G. Robinson plays a reformed gangster whose brewery business is failing due to the poor quality of its products. He has always relied on his gang members using intimidation to sell his beer. Now that he has retired from crime, his business is facing huge losses. At the same time, his beloved daughter is in love with a rich man's son, but her condition for marriage is that the man must have an independent occupation. The young man is forced to temporarily work as a policeman, as this is the only job he can find.</p>
<p>Luck changes everything. Another gang of bandits, fighting over hidden gold, massacre each other in Edward's residence. When Edward and his crew arrive, they unexpectedly find a house full of corpses and a large amount of money. The prospective son-in-law, the policeman, shoots the corpses again and unintentionally kills the bandit leader, earning the credit for eliminating a menace to society.</p>
<p>Although Edward G. Robinson's style in this film has subtle changes, his acting is still as skillful and refined as in his previous films such as "Little Caesar" and "The Whole Town's Talking." He vividly portrays the character of a gangster with lifelike perfection. The supporting actors, all adept at playing gangsters, also give satisfactory performances.</p>
<p>Peace... Border Law</p>
<p>Border Law</p>
<p>The whole film is set in the American West, depicting a story of a hero seeking revenge by killing bandits. Although the film is not very long, it has the advantages of a typical Western: tense plots, lively action, coupled with Lupita Tovar's Spanish-style clear singing and passionate acting. In the midst of tense and exciting situations, it adds a lot of lighthearted romance. George O'Brien has superb skills in this film. Among all his works, this "Border Law" has a better performance.</p>
<p>Cathay... Battle of Broadway</p>
<p>Battle of Broadway</p>
<p>The film depicts two tough guys representing a certain factory who go to New York on a mission. At the same time, they are entrusted with a private task by the factory owner: to disrupt the love affair between the factory owner's son and a Broadway singer. Unexpectedly, the two men are also lustful and become madly infatuated with another singer. Subsequently, the factory owner also personally intervenes, leading to jealousy and chaos.</p>
<p>The story of this film is nothing to write home about, but the scenes are still lively and interesting. The performances of the two main actors, Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, who play rough and tough, and their mutual fooling around, are amusing. The climax of the film, the brawl in the mental hospital, is one of the most brilliant scenes in the film, both tense and riotous, while filled with comedic elements.</p>
<p>Oriental... Bulldog Drummond in Africa</p>
<p>Bulldog Drummond in Africa</p>
<p>Great China... Of Human Hearts</p>
<p>Of Human Hearts</p>
<p>The film has a strong tragic element, and the plot resembles a Chinese familial drama. Apart from James Stewart, the other actors seem relatively unfamiliar to us, but their performances do not disappoint.</p>

<h3>Essential Knowledge for Physical Training</h3>
<p>— Wong Hok-ching</p>
<p>This article is limited to people aged sixteen to forty years old and is not entirely suitable for children or the elderly, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>Physical training refers to both the mind and body. In terms of the body, it is nothing more than developing muscles and exercising the physique, which will increase qi and strength.</p>
<p>To have truly complete physical fitness, physical training must advance both mind and body together. We must recognize the purpose of physical training – health – and also recognize the purpose of health. If we ignore the training of the mind, even the strongest physical strength will not be as good as that of lions, tigers, apes, and other fierce beasts.</p>
<p>In terms of the body, developing muscles, exercising internal organs, and increasing qi and strength are also interrelated. If one is neglected, not only will the various parts of the body not develop evenly, but it may also harm the body. The body's training must also proceed from "inner" to "outer." People with a good foundation can advance "inner" and "outer" together. "Inner" training refers to the training of internal organs. Among the training of internal organs, the most important include the heart, lungs, large and small intestines, stomach, etc., as well as the circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems. If these three systems have normal and active functions, the entire system will definitely become stronger. If you strengthen the inside first, and then engage in external training to develop muscles, you can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Although there are slight differences in the methods of exercising strength and developing muscles, as long as the internal organs are strong and the muscles are developed, strength will naturally increase accordingly.</p>
<p>In the training of the mind, it is nothing more than a strong will, a spirit of hard work and endurance, bright and upright thoughts, a noble character, etc. If the training of the mind is lacking, not only will the true meaning of health be lost or the purpose of health not be achieved. In fact, the mind and body are also mutually related. If the training of the mind is ignored, while focusing on the training of the body, it will be difficult to obtain the greatest effect.</p>
<p>Exercise is not the only way to train the physique, but rather one of many methods. The only active method of training the physique is sports. The scope of sports is very broad and does not only refer to running and jumping. All active elements related to health should be included in the scope of sports. We must consider all sports methods at the same time and not focus on only one or several. Otherwise, not only will we not be able to obtain the greatest effect, but we will often harm our health.</p>
<p>Among the various sports methods, it is difficult for us to determine which is the most important. Among them, the most problematic and difficult method to understand is exercise. There are different opinions about exercise, each with its own words, and even theories that are completely contradictory. It is especially difficult for beginners to resolve the various problems of exercise.</p>
<p>Among all the exercises, the most effective are calisthenics and machine exercises. The characteristics of these exercises have been discussed with everyone, so I will not elaborate further. If we want to achieve the greatest effect from exercise, in addition to advancing both mind and body together and developing the body "inner" and "outer" evenly, we must also pay attention to the following points: one, two (one)</p>

<h3>Work on the Lunar New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Pang Tai</p>
<p>Suggestions to Comrades in the National Salvation Movement</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year is just around the corner. The common people seem to be wholeheartedly revering their ancestors to celebrate the Lunar New Year, and they cannot help but take time off at the end of the twelfth lunar month and the beginning of the new year to eat a meal and relax. This is the golden opportunity for comrades in the national salvation movement. National salvation workers should not let go of this opportunity and should pay attention to the following tasks.</p>
<p>1. Launch a thrift campaign: Everyone knows that burning incense, lighting candles, burning paper money, setting off firecrackers, and pasting door gods and couplets are customs that have little meaning. Completely abolishing them is sometimes not easy, so we should come up with a compromise. Like a certain village in Ping Shan, Huiyang last year, all the gods were invited to a forest, and it was enough to worship them twice. Haha, this kind of collective worship of gods is also a fresh and new trick. As for writing couplets, we should write them for them, and we should seize the opportunity to change the content.</p>
<p>Secondly, making rice cakes and pastries wastes food and is unhygienic. However, villagers cannot disobey us and lose face in front of their relatives because of old customs, so we must widely publicize and point out the harms. At a minimum, we must make them reduce this kind of consumption as much as possible.</p>
<p>We must also pay close attention to excessive drinking and eating at banquets and endless lingering. We should do these things according to the depth of the environment's acceptance, and we must start from our own families and villages.</p>
<p>2. During the New Year period, everyone will still be able to scrape together some money in their pockets, and the rich are even less of a problem. At this time, we can launch large-scale fundraising campaigns. In addition to donating money, food is also good, just like in Danshui Pingshan, Huiyang, where thousands of bags of peanuts were previously collected to comfort the defense army. Now we can raise money to make winter clothes or collect cakes to send to refugees in the rear and soldiers on the front lines. In short, it is easier to raise donations in the New Year, so let's launch a fundraising campaign for money and food!</p>
<p>3. Joint armed hunting: In the short period after the New Year, most people are relatively free. At this time, it is very easy for them to go to improper entertainment venues, so we should organize joint village and clan hunting, which is also a good way to organize guerrillas. From this activity, we can learn about their armed strength and at the same time give them tactical knowledge of guerrilla warfare. Oh, this meaningful movement is very meaningful to encourage in our counter-offensive. It is said that Danshui Pingshan is already preparing to do so.</p>
<p>4. Such as anti-gambling propaganda, spring farming propaganda, school resumption propaganda... etc., are also goals that we should strive to achieve.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to especially introduce that our propaganda team should cooperate with the village lion dance team, which will provide many opportunities for our convenience. Before, during, and after their lion dance, martial arts, and swordplay, we can intersperse songs, speeches, and street dramas. Then our propaganda effectiveness will be very reliable. Fundraising teams following this kind of lion dance team are even more suitable. The Zijin Guzhu Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team is now busy preparing to cooperate with this opportunity!</p>
<p>In the Lunar New Year, we must show our great work to achieve the two major goals of relieving the suffering of our compatriots and comforting the soldiers fighting against Japan.</p>
<h3>Orderly</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>——Random Thoughts on Travel in the War Zone——</p>
<p>An officer's wife asked me why I didn't bring an orderly. I said, "Originally, I did have an orderly, but he died in Nanjing. After I returned south from Shanxi, I deeply felt that using orderlies was unreasonable." I meant to tell her, "It is understandable for orderlies in the army to do military affairs. But it is not right for an orderly to act as a servant for an officer's wife." Not long after, her orderly 'went AWOL' and left on his own. She was furious and said, "Did I not treat him well? When playing cards, I gave him the starting money! He eats and wears better than anyone else. Look at those soldiers; aren't they shivering in this weather?" Because I had known her for a long time, I spoke frankly to her: "Madam, this is what you don't understand. You say he lacks nothing, but he lacks two important things: 'hope' and 'honor.' There is not much hope in being an officer's orderly, and even less hope in being an officer's wife's orderly. It is not glorious to be an officer's orderly. It is even less glorious to be an officer's wife's orderly. Think about it: even if he had hope and was promoted to a junior officer, others would secretly say that he used to be an orderly for so-and-so's wife. Where would he put his face? I don't know about others, but I myself would rather starve to death than be an orderly, unless my lover became an officer, she became Mu Guiying, and I became Yang Zongbao." They laughed at each other after hearing this.</p>
<p>My younger brother, Ji Ju, who has lived in the army for many years, once summarized the feelings of people in the army about orderlies: "A good king will appear every five hundred years, and a good orderly is hard to come by in a thousand years! Finding a good orderly seems even more difficult than finding a premier of the Executive Yuan. Thinking carefully, it is not that it is difficult to find the right person for the job of orderly. It is that the system of orderlies is fundamentally wrong. Those who curse the orderlies say that the smart ones will be slippery, freeloading, and have affairs with officers' wives, doing everything imaginable. The honest ones are stupid as cows, and everything must be pushed and poked to get them to move, causing constant annoyance. But examining all the tasks of an orderly, when the officer had not yet been promoted, he managed them himself. There is no reason why he cannot manage them himself after becoming an officer. And those orderlies who serve the officer's wife are actually just saving the wife the cost of a maid. Frankly speaking, it is also taking public funds for private gain, which is completely unacceptable. The reason why the officer's wife wants to use an orderly is partly to save money, but more so to show that she is the wife of an officer. This is also a very wrong mentality.</p>
<p>We, who live with the army, have agreed to take care of our own affairs and cultivate the habit of serving ourselves. The result of this habit is very good. Sometimes, serving each other can even enhance deep friendship. I often say that if bureaucratic politics are not broken, there is no hope for national construction. To break bureaucratic politics, we must first break the old master and mistress mentality of the bourgeoisie."</p>

<h3>Hesitation</h3>
<p>— Bao Yi</p>
<p>A sheep separated from the flock, a boat without a rudder, drifting aimlessly in the vast and boundless life, unable to grasp anything real, sadness, anger, and hesitation surrounding me, everything I hear and see is a miserable sight—</p>
<p>I don't want to live like this anymore. If I live like this, I am convinced that my life will be meaningless. I want to drive away the evil people surrounding me, I want to break through all the dark environments, I want to seek a straight path from the midst of hesitation and reach the ideal paradise.</p>
<p>But, the powerful enemy of the ideal does not let me go, but more fiercely exerts his power on me, and uses more cruel means to intensify the pressure on me. The whip of life ruthlessly lashes me, without any room for relaxation, giving me a chance to breathe. The sinister nature of human relationships uses vicious tactics to control me everywhere. My fragile soul cannot withstand such attacks and oppression, I can't help but feel pain and tears!</p>
<p>However, just relying on tears, you still can't escape the sad, hesitating realm. This is tantamount to expressing submission to the dark environment, this is obviously the victory of the environment over one's own pain and no escape from the past. This only shows weakness instead of positive action to replace struggle.</p>
<p>I know that pain is spiral, and in the process of life, it is endless. People who do not understand life divide pain and happiness into two parts, but in fact pain and happiness are always connected together; without pain, you will not know happiness, and only when you know pain can you realize happiness.</p>
<p>I want to cheer myself up from the depths of pain: teach to use the greatest determination to overcome the dark environment, not be pessimistic, not hesitate, and wholeheartedly go to the ideal paradise. I must greatly change from today on the previous errors in the concept of life and the lack of the courage to fight. That is to use a strong determination to replace pessimism and hesitation to stabilize the future.</p>
<h3>In the Sunset Glow</h3>
<p>— Hong Yan</p>
<p>The fields are quiet, and the north wind is blowing very gently. The setting sun climbed to the edge of life, its face flushed red, glaring at the people and the land.</p>
<p>A-Fu, Xiao Lu, and Lao Liu, three children slowly walked up the embankment, humming in unison the song newly composed by Lao Liu—a young, strong Dongbei person;</p>
<p>Thinking of the events of the 20th year of the Republic of China,</p>
<p>That can make a man of iron shed tears;</p>
<p>Our fields were trampled by Japanese devils,</p>
<p>Thirty million compatriots turned into beasts of burden!</p>
<p>We were forbidden to speak our own language,</p>
<p>We were driven out of our own homes.</p>
<p>We can no longer hear the sobbing tides of the Heilongjiang River,</p>
<p>Nor can we see the shining clouds on Changbai Mountain!</p>
<p>But, we need not complain.</p>
<p>We will never let the flag of the Japanese devils fly for long,</p>
<p>We will pay back with an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth!</p>
<p>Compatriots, unite,</p>
<p>Use bloody battles as our answer!</p>
<p>Use bloody battles as our answer! Answer! Repeatedly shouting, only three miles away from Xicun!</p>
<p>"Lao Liu! You said, what should we do if we are searched, with these few weapons?" A-Fu suddenly asked the brave villager softly, while stroking the slightly protruding object on the left side of his chest.</p>
<p>"Fool, what are you afraid of! If they don't give us trouble, then forget it, let them live a few more days, otherwise, hum! If they're tired of living, we'll send them back!" Lao Liu replied briskly.</p>
<p>"However, this is a little inconvenient for our mission!" Xiao Lu said coldly.</p>
<p>No one else continued to speak, and the surrounding air became silent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, A-Er grabbed Lao Liu's sleeve, stopped on the road, and gently pointed forward with his mouth: "Hum! Be careful! They're coming!"</p>
<p>About ten lengths of road ahead. Two things hugging two three-eight rifles, walked towards this side laughing and joking.</p>
<p>"Never mind them, let's walk forward carefully! The sun is going down soon!" Lao Liu said as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Closer, the two sides were only about a foot apart!</p>
<p>The two things swaggered and swayed like drunkards, suddenly startled to see these three tall and strong partners, quickly picked up the three-eight rifles with bayonets, and mumbled:</p>
<p>"Stop! Stop! Bad guys! Guerrilla army."</p>
<p>"Damn it! Have to let Grandpa take action," Lao Liu cursed, and immediately made a look at Xiao Lu and A-Fu.</p>
<p>The two immediately took a step forward, stood in the middle of the road, and raised their hands. Lao Liu also followed suit, but his position was a little further back.</p>
<p>"Hahaha..." The other side laughed triumphantly, both holding a rifle in one hand, and reaching out to search Xiao Lu and A-Fu's bodies with the other.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Lao Liu snatched the shiny bayonet, and then quickly stabbed the one searching Xiao Lu's brain. He fell!</p>
<p>The other one was about to turn around and run, but A-Fu had already grabbed him. He wanted to shout, but Xiao Lu had already covered his mouth with one hand! His face flushed red, struggling desperately!</p>
<p>Lao Liu made a hole in the top of his head like the other one, while sighing hatefully:</p>
<p>"Little bastard, you've delayed Grandpa's time! Today Grandpa has to happily kill a few more of you! Humph, you're happy,"</p>
<p>The setting sun, with its blazing red face, had reached the horizon, and before setting, it still reflected a ray of afterglow.</p>
<h3>Three Dream Traces</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——Ethnic Novel Talk</p>
<p>During the reigns of Emperor Yingzong and Emperor Jingtai of the Ming Dynasty, Esen invaded, which is exactly the shadow of today's × people. He repeatedly demanded bribes, never satisfied. He looked down on China, thinking he could conquer it in one battle, but when Yu Qian resisted in the capital, he realized that China could not be humiliated, and he suffered a great setback. The "West Lake Anecdotes," Volume 8, "Three Dream Traces," is dedicated to Yu Qian's life. Most of the descriptions are based on Volume 170 of the Ming History, the biography of Yu Qian. However, the introduction narrates anecdotes from Yu Qian's childhood, which are taken from legends. Even the clay statues of gods feared Yu Qian, and those dispatched to Lingnan as chariots were afraid, and those ordered to kneel had to obey. These kinds of stories are commonly seen in Lin Lan's "Stories of Zhu Hongwu." As for his ability to speak eloquently and respond quickly, that is often seen in Lin Lan's "Stories of Witty Couplets." As for specifically engaging in conversations with monks, that was only because of the two sentences in his biography: "There was a strange person who said, 'In the future, he will be a fortunate minister who saves the times!'" In "Three Dream Traces," it is written: "That monk said, 'Gentlemen, do not laugh. This child has extraordinary bones and is eloquent. In the future, he will be a prime minister who restores order!'"</p>
<p>Regarding Yu Qian's defense of the capital against Esen, both the Ming History biography and Volume 8 of "West Lake Tour Records" have records. The Ming History is better, not as convoluted as the "Tour Records." The Ming History also depicts the war scenes in a more vivid manner, unlike the "Tour Records," which are lackluster. At that time, it was October of the first year of Jingtai. The Ming History says: "Esen, holding the retired Emperor, broke through Zijing Pass and directly invaded the capital. Shi Heng proposed to gather troops and defend the city, exhausting the enemy. Yu Qian disagreed, saying, 'How can we show weakness and make × even more despise us!' He quickly divided and dispatched the generals, leading an army of 220,000, and arrayed them outside the nine gates. He ordered all city gates to be closed and personally supervised the battle, giving the order: 'If a general retreats before his army, the general will be beheaded; if an army retreats before its general, the rear ranks will behead the front ranks.' Thus, the officers and soldiers knew they would surely die, and all fought with their lives. Initially, Esen advanced deep, thinking the capital could be taken in a day or two. But when he saw the officers and soldiers waiting in strict formation, his intentions were slightly frustrated. The rebel Yue Ning incited him to invite ministers to welcome the Emperor and demand gold and silk in the hundreds of millions. The Emperor refused, and Esen's morale was further diminished. On the gengshen day, the bandits probed Desheng Gate. Yu Qian ordered Heng to set up an ambush in empty houses and sent a few riders to lure ×. × came with ten thousand cavalry. Deputy Commander Fan Guang fired firearms, and the ambush rose up and attacked together. Esen's brother was shot and killed. Peng Yimen pursued the bandits to the earthen city. Residents went up to the roofs and shouted, throwing bricks and stones to attack the bandits. The sound shook the heavens. When reinforcements arrived, the bandits retreated. After five days of stalemate, Esen's invitation was not answered, and the battle was unfavorable. Knowing that he could not achieve his goals, he took the retired Emperor west. Yu Qian dispatched the generals to pursue them to the pass and then returned. For his merits, Yu Qian was promoted to Junior Protector and Supervisor of Military Affairs." (Excerpt) As for the full text of "Three Dream Traces," I think it is not necessary to quote it extensively here.</p>
<p>Two points can be noted in the above quotation. First, Esen "thought the capital could be taken in a day or two." This contrasts with the enemy's estimation of a quick victory at Taierzhuang. Only after suffering losses did they sigh, "I never thought that little Taierzhuang would be so difficult!" Second, the people went up to the roofs and used bricks and stones to resist, achieving success. From this, we can see the necessity of arming the people. If the entire nation were soldiers, and there were battles everywhere, then the × people would be impossible to defend against and would eventually collapse.</p>
<p>Yu Qian's patriotism can be seen in Volume 8 of the "Tour Records": "During the Jingtai era, the northern [enemies] and the southern expeditions made military affairs heavy. The Duke often settled several matters in a day and did not stop until late at night, often saying, 'Where will this heart's blood be spilled!'"</p>
<p>Five of his poems are preserved in Volume 11 of "A Collection of Ming Dynasty Poetry." The "Tour Records" also records fragments of poems, such as the poem about Su Wu: "Wealth or poverty, do not ask, A loyal heart repays the nation, that is what a man should do." And: "Do not laugh at the simple traveling bag, I alone keep my sword leaning against the blue sky." Both "can be seen as his isolated and upright character" and "his spirit of loyalty and integrity."</p>
<p>Ming people commemorated Yu Qian with poems, the more famous being Huang Fengxiang's "Visiting the Shrine of Junior Protector Yu," saying, "The nine tripods are as stable as a mountain, the borders are as calm as if rolled up." Also, Yang Zhuo's "Worshipping at the Tomb of Duke Zhongsu Yu," saying, "Remember the events of the Jingtai era, With one hand supporting the sky and assisting the heavens in punishment. The iron staff before the Sima Gate is cold, the spears sweeping outside Juyong Pass."</p>
<p>Someone made "The Soul of the Chinese Nation for Five Thousand Years" (?) and regarded Yu Qian as one of the four pillars, alongside Xie An, Li Gang, and Yu Yunwen, showing the utmost respect.</p>
<p>Regarding the novels written about Yu Qian, there is also Sun Gaochong's "The Complete Biography of Junior Protector Yu's Loyalty," ten volumes in forty biographies. There is also a Ming person's "Authentic Biography," which is dedicated to Yu Qian. The former survives, while the latter is lost, showing that "public opinion is in people's hearts."</p>
