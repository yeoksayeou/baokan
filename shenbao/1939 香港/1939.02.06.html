<h3 id="c1">日軍閥的騙局及其結果 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>古今東西的軍閥，醉心於强權，都是不相信世上有公理和眞情，祗有武力卽可以爲所欲爲，多設騙局卽可以統治異民族，拿破崙的敗北，維廉二世的失敗，尙且不足以給它們驚醒，反說是先人的不高明，所以維廉儘管失敗，希特勒仍抄襲其故技，田中儘管失敗，板垣仍是原性不改的，因爲希特勒和板垣認爲先人的不智在於輕視政治工作，尤其是宣傳工作，在希特勒和板垣們心目中的宣傳卽是騙局，多設計幾樣騙局就可以成功，其實騙局的結果又是怎樣呢？我們且從板垣們年來的騙局叙述一下吧；</p>
<p>日軍閥欺騙中國人的宣傳原則是「無領土野心　和「援助中國的獨立」，是「中日合作」，是「反共救國」，這些騙局展開於我們的面前的事實是這樣的：</p>
<p>（一）所謂「大漢主義」是去年五月間由漢好張鳴搬進厦門的，日軍閥在厦門宣傳「大漢主義」的理由，據說是接納漢奸張鳴的建議的結果，因爲華南民族主義思想已根深蒂固，旣不能採用三民主義，就要來一種民族主義的幌子，才能吸收靑年及海外的華僑，日軍閥想起來也是近道理的建議，所以慨然接納，同時並目解明大漢主義的宗旨是漢民族的自治主義，順便也可以證明日軍閥在厦門並無領土的野心，漢奸張鳴開始宣傳「大漢主義」不上一個月，台灣政府就來了一張嚴重的抗議，說甚麼台灣有五百萬的漢民族，若「大漢主義」風行到台灣，台灣革命起來誰去負責，接踵而來的是要求厦門歸台灣政府統治，經過五個月的爭執，廈門的統治權竟落在台灣政府手裏，「大漢主義」也跟張鳴赴上海過寓公生活了，「大漢主義」的敎訓就是騙局，永遠的騙局！</p>
<p>（二）「和平救國」運動也是日軍閥得意的騙局，這個騙局的導演者是土肥原，在華北的執行者是喜多，華中是楠本，華南是萱野和高橋，口號是和平又是救國，眞實的意圖是分化統一陣綫和瓦解國民黨，這種陰謀是從徐州失守後開始的，胃充救亡團體發出僞通電和聲明書，造謠言誹謗將領附×，散佈和平空氣，所有的騙術盡量搬上舞台表演了，但是半年來所得的結果是汪兆銘的逃亡和××日報被××，一切的騙局都被折穿了。</p>
<p>事後板垣談云：「汪兆銘悮解我們的眞意，我們期待汪能在重慶內部起作用，現在他走了。」</p>
<p>（三）「反共親日的政府」是日軍閥掩飾「無領土野心」和「援助中國獨立」的烟慕。所以土肥原拚命拉攏唐紹儀出山，唐死後又拼命運動吳佩孚出任僞大統領，以便於欺騙國際，玩弄落伍的群衆，以利誘威脅和造謠的手段，欲迫吳佩孚下海做漢奸，但是吳佩孚提出兩個條件，一爲政權交還中國人，一一爲組織中國人指揮的軍隊，旣稱無領土的野心又要援助中國獨立，吳佩孚的條件當然是可以接受，爲何不能應允，偏要自拆穿自己的騙局呢？有田外相在十二月廿二日的國會演說，宣稱「帝國政府期望新中央政府從速成立與我方協力收拾戰局」，僅經過八天後，又在國會答復議員的質問的時候，竟自翻前說，並謂「從歷史及現狀看，造成以中國爲一體的中央政府是不容易的，要在連合地方政權應付國際而已」，這是自打嘴吧的行動，騙局只是騙局，假話說不出眞事，那是意料中的事。</p>
<p>現在日軍閥的誘降政策已經失敗，騙局又是不成，而國際危機巳緊迫於三島的門前，爲要打開僵局，政黨方面建議召開中日民族會議，從會議中找出解决糾紛的路徑，元老重臣方面又在計劃召集國際會議解决中日紛爭，這種建議，平沼在當初是不接受的，但是國內的危機已到最深刻的階段，國際干涉的危機，亦因美國參加陣營，具實現的可能性，確是軍閥意料外的迫切，故日來平沼的態度逐漸傾向於接納，但是軍閥仍是執迷不悟而且正在計劃新的騙局，冀望在騙局中取得便宜！</p>
<p>不管日政局如何轉變，日軍閥怎樣翻出新花樣，騙局永遠是騙局，絕對不能解决中日的糾紛，我們應該提高政治的警惕性，加緊戰區的政治工作，與軍事並進，以我們的實力粉碎日軍閥的迷夢—使日軍閥知道公理的威力！</p>

<h3 id="c2">新的世界大戰（二） <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 陳友仁</p>
<p>在事實上，如今在亞洲，歐洲，非洲，已見有「不宣而戰」的實際的戰爭狀態。這狀態隨時可突現於目前，只要你能看一看那些新的「凱薩」似在奧國，在捷克，在西班牙，在地中海，在北非與巴里斯丹，在阿比西尼，在中國和遠東的海上的計劃的和實際的動作。而這類的動作，你又可見其行將擴展到別的地區：到意大利認爲倫敦信約允劃讓而還沒有劃讓給他的那些地區，到埃及，到英法比葡荷蘭的屬地，並到亞洲，到太平洋其他的地區。如果德意的活動仍繼續在尼加拉加及美洲別處進行不斷，則動作的擴展，又行將要達到門羅主義地域範圍內的重要據點。</p>
<p>（四）戰爭與外交</p>
<p>這類的動作有若千類的形態。在對待一個弱小而又沒有與別强國訂立軍事協定的國家，如中國，阿比西尼亞，和西班牙，則這類的動作就表現於公開戰爭的形態。如果是要對待一個弱小的而同時又與英法訂有軍事協定關係的國家，那末，動作的表現，就要採取別的形態。又如果要對付强盛的英法，則明知英法如得蘇俄的援助，大可以將當今的「凱薩」們制服，那末，動作的表現，當另採別的花樣。總而言之，在對付强國及與强國有軍事協定關係的弱國，當今的　凱薩」們，自會根據其極權的外交方式與辦法，從多方面，運用其『無形戰爭』的新戰略。在外交上的運用，他們自與英法不同。英法之視外交，是一種賭博，一種技巧。希特勒和莫索里尼則視外交爲戰爭中的一個部門。</p>
<p>那末，如今同時在各地發生的有形與無形的戰爭的動作是可視作偶然的事態嗎？我們在這裏又大可以問前次的世界大戰的各戰陣是否亦是偶然發生的局部戰？</p>
<p>在如今的有形的與無形的戰爭中，實在是一個共通的作用。如今的有形的與無形的戰爭的動作，實在是和前次世界大戰的各陣地的戰爭沒有分別。在前次世界大戰，彙合西方戰場的法蘭　與法國北境之戰爭和一九一四至一九一七年其他戰場之戰爭而成爲歐洲大戰。自美國參戰後，這個歐戰就一變而成爲世界大戰了。如今，則彙合九一八日本實行在中國發動的有形戰爭，一九三五年意大利在阿比西尼亞發動的有形戰爭，一九三六年德意在西班牙發動的有形戰爭，和德意在歐洲各地，在地中海，在北非，及在巴力斯丹發動的無形戰爭，而成一個「大戰的會合」。這「大戰的會合」，如今則由反共協定的出現而成爲新的世界大戰了。</p>
<p>（五）獨裁者與戰禍</p>
<p>而察覺這個所謂「下次的世界大戰」實在已經發生，實是不容易。因爲這大戰的來臨，宛如基督聖經上所說死神的降臨，在深夜好像小竊般的偷進！</p>
<p>前次的世界大戰之開始，完全根據國際公法所規定的儀式舉行，先之以正式宣戰，繼之以軍事之迅速動員，再殿之以大量的殺戮。而許多人們對於「下次的世界大戰」的開幕，尙深信必經同樣的儀式，必先見同樣的凶兆。但這次戰爭，這次當今的獨裁領袖久巳開始的戰爭，到進入决定勝負第二階段，到進入極權國家開始總攻擊的時候，自然有極慘痛極大量的殺戮：而這新的大戰不獨巳無正式宣戰的必要，亦無突然舉行動員的必要，蓋在獨裁者治下的極權國家中，軍隊久已作永久的動員了。</p>
<p>猶諸古之羅馬，在戰爭時實行獨裁制度，以求較有效的領導作戰，如今的德意很顯然的有一個坐大的領袖，有一個鬬爭的領袖。他們久已實際和公開的用完全獨裁者的精神與手段統治他們的國家。他們已運用他們的權力與極權的辦法將全國的男子，物質，和精神的力量動員，而將其國家變成了最高度的戰鬬的國家。在戰爭時期，甚至一個民主的國家也須採取這樣的辦法。卽前次世界大戰時的民主國家，也曾在大致上實行這集中權力的手段。民主國家且如此，那末，這些懷着只有用戰爭手段才能達到其目的的獨裁者，自然更須儘量的運用其全國的極權的組織與職能，以求達到建立「我的奮鬥」書中所想望的大德意志第三帝國，莫索里尼的新羅馬帝國和日本少壯派獨裁者所想望假借一東亞新秩序」招牌而樹立的擴大的日本帝國。</p>
<h3 id="c3">看×人將怎樣犯桂 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 本報派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>武漢撤守。迄今三月，相持沉寂之戰局，最近復有漸趨緊張之勢。其主要原因，則由於疲敝之×，飢不擇食，掣草湊籃，以老弱靑年及僞蒙軍，略事補充整理，不忘速戰速决（？）的迷夢，再想來作弩末之掙扎。且自×前首相發表荒謬媾和的聲明以後，對我不僅不能售其政治分化的陰謀，反使我內部潛伏着的動搖分子，因此簸颺以去，全國團結，益增鞏固；同時，國際實力援華，亦伴隨我抗戰轉入新階段，日趨積極，紛紛對我信甩貸欵，眼見我抗戰建國大業，卽將迅速順利以完成——這，在日法西軍閥們看來，當然是他們侵略政策的最嚴重之打擊！當此千鈞一髮的時機，日軍閥們倘能立刻放下屠刀，知難而退一，其國家生命，或不致從此斷送；但認爲「日本人個個都是拿破侖」的日軍閥們，他們是絕不肯這樣去幹的，這好像老水牛進仄巷，打不來轉　，只好將錯就錯，蠻幹到底。從而知他們對我政治陰謀旣吿失敗，也要繼續在軍事上作來孤注一擲。</p>
<p>在軍事上作孤注一擲，便想把我們整個中國民族，一口吞下，談何容易？打開天窻說亮話：第一期抗戰，我們人體和機械搏鬥，血肉與砲火死拚，我們固然要遭逢一些意中料的失敗：而今我們抗戰到了第二期，軍隊素質已改良，數量增多，並添設機械化部隊，其他軍政，政治，經濟各部門機構，均經堅強密綿的改進，使能配合戰時的需要。無論西北，中部，西南各戰場，以及×後各游擊區，一切必要　進備工作，都已加倍努力完成。不管×人側重任何方面向我進攻，抑或南北中三方面同時幷犯，我們都能予以極其强劫的打擊，而粉碎其任何進攻的策略。</p>
<p>尤有進者：在第二期抗戰發動後，若×人因兵力限制，採取北守南攻，或南守化攻的戰略時，那末，我們的應付方法，因在前期戰果上，旣爭獲主動地位，决於本期實行全面抗戰，則對×主力進犯之路，固須出全力以迎頭痛擊，此外對×採取守勢的方面，亦當「一視同仁」，大張撻伐，驅彼××，還我河山。故戰火燃燒之處，不專在×主力進犯的一個戰區，而是南化中以及×後的一切戰區，戰地較前期抗戰擴大，戰事亦較前期極爲猛烈，距我「最後勝利」的途程，自亦更加縮短而接近。</p>
<p>再具體的說：今後戰局，我們鑒於前期所獲得的血的敎訓，要嚴防×人使用較少兵力，得在各戰塲上，從容抽調，向我各個擊破的話，那我們决採用「擊南則北應，擊北則南應，擊中則南北皆應」的戰略，步步爲營，處處設陣，不等它來打我，我便先去打它，必然要使它招架不了，而困敗于楚歌四逼中。</p>
<p>以上是記者對第二期戰局的粗線的看法——所以新年爆竹聲響後，正擬從衡陽趣裝北上，街頭遇着一同業，剛從粤北戰塲來，他說：×人從粤北戰地，相縱撤退，集中廣州，擬會合北海×艦，準備進犯廣西，故第二期戰事重心，必在廣西境內；幷勸我復折回廣西，一同去工作。但經我把一廣西固將吃緊，中部及西北亦不免將有大戰一的理由告他，他也非常的首肯。</p>
<p>不過戰火兇燄，巳　漫粤桂邊境，局勢將有怎樣的演變？這確是極堪注意的問題。爲了要得到這問題的可靠解答，特往訪第×路軍駐衡辦事處主任謝宗鏗氏：謝氏是廣西人，並在該省軍政界歷任要職，故對廣西人非常熟習。據他說：『廣西是我西南抗戰的一大根據地，×早遲欲侵犯，亦是意料中事。也許犯桂目的，僅在「聲東擊西」，牽制我西南兵力，以掩護在西北的奮動。測其犯桂路綫，不外三條：一條溯西江而上：一條由北海登陸；一條或自廣東四會，沿公路經廣　等縣，侵入桂境懷寧，以威脅桂林。可是桂省多山，險峻天成，自來發生戰爭，無不難攻易守。×人果能利用淺水艦，溯西江面上，傾其力量進犯，最多不渦得達梧州；梧州以上，水路則淺而多灘，絕難航行，陸路則支道分歧，過河無橋；×縱增用三倍兵力，　亦無法推進寸步。若企圖由化海登陸，但沿岸淺灘，寬達二十餘里，輕重兵　，均不得靠岸，目沿岸防綫，固如金湯，×僅用汽艇大砲騷擾，斷難震撼我防綫之毫髮。至於自四會入桂公路，尤多　山峻　路綫變曲崎嶇，眞難加以形容。沿路地　，旣不　合機械化部隊的活動，遇必要時，我們更可將全路加以迅速破壞。廣四天然環境，實充分具有優越的國防條件，幷得人事上的堅强凖備，已早將各路入口險要處，都部署成一道道的天塹了—　安排香餅釣金鰲」，看你　兒——×人怎樣來侵犯』？</p>
<p>謝氏這一席談話，如老吏斷獄，中無一字　句，而不根擄實情。華北士地平曠，交通便利，×人尙且馬上一得」之，而不能下馬治之，今對天時地利人和三者具佔的廣西，　企圖人舉　犯，這未免太不度德不量力了，雖然，古人說得好：『慶父不死，魯難未已。』日法西軍閥們的掠奪懲業，戰爭野心，不失敗到山窮水盡時，她萬會多望囘頭的。來吧；我們負有保衛大廣西重任的中華男兒英勇將士，已將炮衣褪下，刺刀擦亮，久候多時了！</p>

<p>— 蒙</p>
<p>【昆明特約航訊】昆明處在西南的一角、過去因爲　通閉　、經　困難、文化無從灌漑、所以在抗戰　它是一個文化較低落的地方、自中日戰事發動後、一年來的昆明、一切都任活躍了、就文化方面　、昆明多了兩家報館、遷來了五個國立大學、來了很多文化人、增加了幾個劇團、新出了許多雜誌。</p>
<p>（一）報紙</p>
<p>昆明原來有兩家報館、『雲南日報』與『民國日報一、前者創辦的歷史頗久、在本地銷路還好、後者是雲南省黨部的黨報、社址設在黨部內、這兩家報紙、你們受了新文化的灌漑、近來都有了顯著的進步、</p>
<p>新近來到昆明的報紙、是天津益世報與南京朝報、益世報去年十二月八日在昆明復刊、雖然只有一個多月的時間、他的銷路却是特別、這一方面因爲他們的工作緊張、新添了幾在大學讀書的靑年記者、所以顯得異樣的活躍、一方面　他的副刊特別多、『宗敎與文化』、『靑年園地』、『烽火圍中』、『讀書』、『圖書』『敎育』、『史學』『醫學』『邊疆』『科學』、前三種是報館主編、自出刊以夾、很博得廣大讀者的好評、</p>
<p>最近益世報又發行了一小張『益世晚報』、昆明第一次看見　報、所以格外受一般市民的歡迎</p>
<p>朝報復刊在去年變十節、它是一張精短的小報、售價　官宜、　天發行的時　、特別早、所以也很得一般市民　愛　、</p>
<p>將來昆明復刊的、還有中央日報長沙版、他們的器與全體職已、已由桂林起程、不久可到達昆明、同時、重慶時事新報也將在昆明設分館、</p>

<h3 id="c14">斥希特勒荒謬演講　陳友仁發表談話　建議外交當局速提抗議 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>【本報特訊】德元首希　勒去週在國會講演，對於日本之侵華　强詞奪　的讚美，謂『爲人類文明　戰』。其侮辱吾國，情見乎辭。記者因走謁。　外長陳友仁氏，提出此問題，叩詢　意見。當即冰陳氏發表談話，大對如次：</p>
<p>大欺大騙原則</p>
<p>陳氏謂：『希特勒在其所著一我的奮鬥』書中，曾公然的　言大欺大騙之可貴，謂欺騙愈大，則信者將必愈多。他這次讚美日本，顯然是將此大欺大騙原則在實際的應用。同時，他演辭的全部，亦不外是應用此原則，爲德意日三國所造成的國際偎局，强加　辯。</p>
<p>當今國際事件之最主要點實爲德意日所發動的破壞國際現狀的鬥爭。德國之企圖，是在囊括東歐中歐幷奪取羅里尼亞及蘇俄的油田，以造成其所謂大德意志帝國。同時。亦企圖從英法比葡在非洲的屬地中。奪取若干部份，以造成　殖　地帝國，意國則以控制地中海及支配阿拉伯，幷奪取巴力斯坦及摩蘇爾的　田爲造成其新羅馬大帝國的根據　日本則企圖征服中國，獨覇太平洋，並奪取荷屬東印度的油田，而假借『東亞新秩序』的招牌，實行樹立擴大的日本帝國。油田的奪取和控制，實爲德意日今日所夢寐不能忘者。蓋今日爲飛機坦克車所控制之時代也。</p>
<p>維持國際現狀的國家</p>
<p>這種疆界的變更，只有由戰爭，或由祝目力主維持國際現狀的央美法蘇的屈服，方能　到。因爲和平是維持國際現狀的必須條件，故英美法蘇，在客觀上，實爲當今的和平國家、反之，因爲要破壞國際現狀，須要採用暴力侵略，方能達到，所以德意日三國實爲當今的侵略國。</p>
<p>爲要掩　着侵略的行爲，希特勒如今遂不得不運用其大欺大騙的原則。又因爲英美法的統治階級對布希維克主義，尙存憎念，猶諸封建時代的統治者對資本主義，加以憎怒，於是希特勒　靦顏作態，斥罵蘇聯爲人類寸明之　敵，而反讚美日本在華年來的絕無人道的行爲，曰：爲人類文明而服務。</p>
<p>人類文明眞正的威脅</p>
<p>如果維持人類社會的進化與活動的最善方法是在和平，又如果和平又是人類進步的眞正途徑，則德意日因要破壞國際現狀而生的種種對人類的物質與精神橫加的×行，實爲羅馬帝國解組後對文明人類的最大威脅。</p>
<p>我在　裏得向我國負責决定外交政策的人們。提　建議知王吿。我認爲對於希特勒次無理的讚揚日本年來在華的慘無人道的行爲，而對我精神上外交上橫加的侮辱，外交部義難坐視，應立卽　出一個適當的抗議。</p>
<p>我要正吿的，是很簡單。最近汪精衛氏主張吾國加入反共集團。而反共集團的主張，是：（一）破壞中國，使中國不復成爲獨立的國家，（二）　彙合所有的和平國如英美法蘇，成爲玫擊的對象。因此，迫使吾國參加反共集團，不獨是犧牲中國，奉送日本，同時、亦是準備在維持國際現狀與破壞國際現狀的大戰時，迫使中國反英，反法，反美。</p>
<h3 id="c15">卡爾曼一夕譚 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>【桂林特約航訊】</p>
<p>晚飯後，在樂　社和卡爾曼打了一盤彈子，他邀我再到他的臥室裏去談談。</p>
<p>廣西特製的炭爐，能熊地散放着熱熖。本來不十分寒令的南國的屋宇中，更有入春之感。這位還不過卅二歲而足跡已　遍「烽火中的西班牙」和「在鬥爭中的中國」一蘇聯消息報記者，兼蘇聯新聞影片製造廠的攝影師，雖然才從由　慶飛來的　機下來，但顯得並不疲倦。他興奮地從熱水瓶裏倒了一　熱咖啡遞給我笑着說：『這是從重慶來的熱咖啡！』一壁倒了一材給自己。又把一個麵包放進我的碟子說：『請一嘗用飛機從重慶運來的麵包！』</p>
<p>我喝着帶有熱帶風味的咖啡，啖着自從武漢退出以後，就沒有嘗到過的鬆軟的麵包，不禁說：『這眞是件有趣的事！，不過。到將來中國抗戰勝利以後，你可以在重慶用早茶，漢口吃午餐，南京出席下午的招待記者茶會，而到上海參加慶功的宴舞呢！』</p>
<p>他和悅地笑着。那笑容是在去年九月，他初由蘇聯來武漢後，就熟悉了的。此後我們同浴着鄂湘的車　最後退出武漢。在　縣的一個寒冷的早晨，我曾被這一個笑容邀去，在公路邊的小茶館裏吃他的沙丁魚麵包，談着關於第二期抗戰的一切，長沙別後　十二月初又曾在桂林再見。此後，他就到重慶去了。</p>
<p>他雖在中國抗戰一年後才來到我國，但在前綫和後方，比其他各團的記者們更活躍，他像一個美國人，更具有一個美國新聞記者的活潑和才幹。他同情中國的抗戰，在前綫看到英勇將士們的浴血戰鬥，在後方看到和平民衆的慘遭轟炸，知道只有用實力來對中國作同情的喛助。於是，一四十八號秘密文件一等通訊在莫斯科報紙上刊出了。把日本去西軍閥用毒瓦斯屠殺中國軍民的眞相，吿訴給蘇聯的明友們。他的「愛摩」　影　軋軋地攝取了一在鬥爭中的中國」，即將給蘇　以及世界上千萬電影觀衆對中日戰爭作更接近的觀察。他在外國記者　中，似乎是一個後來者，却是一個中國軍民的取好的朋友。他的筆和攝影機，交流了中蘇兩大民主國家和民族間的熱忱的友情在重慶，短短的一個月中。他不斷地接受着中國朋友的宴請，　乎每大就爲　宴而奔忙着。中國朝野都已知道國際宣傳的重要，對外賓　招待尤其是特別週到。茶　和宴會，常使　一個外賓感到忙碌；但我們除了請國際的朋友　嘗中國菜之外，更重要的還有讓他們「知道」『看見』這兩件事、却反被認爲次要的事。在我是？得應該稍爲一那個二點的。他覺得重慶市足以增加×機轟炸的威力，應該積極在消極防空方面　力。他特別吿訴我，在重慶認識了趙侗，北平附近游擊隊的指揮官，盛讀他的壯美和勇敢。</p>
<p>他說：「在中國艱苦的抗戰獲得最後的勝利以後，中國必和世界上其他最富强的國家一樣。中國的財富一般人都說　地下，只待開發；　在我看來，並不完如此。在四川就看見就地可掘取煤斤的礦區。我對於　西特別感到興味：男子五下萬人在　　作衛國的戰爭；婦女强健耐苦，在後方做着任何勞作，山水　是那麽美麗！一到最沂爲　，廣西在他的膠片上，印着最長的一段。</p>
<p>他把退出武漢以後攝取的新　照片給我看。並一一爲我說明。出於一個電影影師之手的新聞照片，特具着一種藝術的風趣。我看到蔣委員人主席南嶽會議時沉毅的英姿，全國高級將領齊濟一堂的盛况，湯恩伯將　在前綫司令部中　　淡巴菇的閑適的神情，×××師在湘鄂前綫構築的堅强而完美的工事，政治工作的推行，軍民的打成一片等等，通過　的手腕，好多張照片常能代表一篇某一問題的通訊。至於有林轟炸的紀錄，尤必能引起未經親歷其境者的憤　與同情。</p>
<p>他見過蔣夫人宋美齡女士：一她見我，便問我能否講英語。我說能。於是她便口若懸河地對我講了許多。其實我的英語並不精，這樣我便　　不了．我連忙說：『蔣夫人，對不起。我很難　會運未快的英語，』這樣她就慢慢　講了。她眞是一個能幹的婦人，蔣介石將軍的好帮手。</p>
<p>他唔了我許多關於南戰　的問題。他將在一週內到第四戰區去，回到桂林後，打算再後北海。要我和他一起去。北海方面，我本來想去看看，將如能在他　第四戰區歸來時，我已能從　　回到桂林，他倒是一個很　的去北海的旅伴。我吿訴他到北海的公路，到　林　不能再南進了，他得擱置了目備汽車步行。</p>
<p>咖啡喝完，談話也由戰局轉到一般的題，他懷念着現在還在西班牙政府軍手中，朝　恐將陷入法西　手的巴塞。　　，他說：『我有一次在巴塞　邱的一所軍服工廠攝取影片，　裏面完全是女工，常她們知道我是蘇聯的　影師時，全塲都歡呼起來，有一位老年的婦人竟突然熱烈地擁抱我，吻　，　着，我給五十個少年女工包圍着一一接吻。』他談起『在××曾遇到一個名字叫做Yoshihito的日本俘虜，擄供屬於一百零六師　，是一個日本　級官吏的兒士。那孩了竭力作反戰的　調。』他找出許多俘虜照片，我認識了那個日本少年。有一張是一個日本俘虜，一手拈着一枝香烟，一手做着手勢，坐在我國政治工作人員的對面，報吿　他們的軍情。最後，又談到擊彈。我說：『我比較時常玩『落袋』！』他高興極了，說：『在蘇！祗有『落袋』］他也是『落袋』打得好！』</p>
<p>當我們拉拉手，互道晚安時，卡爾曼說『　天下午二時，我們較量一下『落袋』吧！』</p>
<p>（一九三九，一，二六，桂林）。</p>

<p>— 天齡譯</p>
<p>本文乃據譯自凱達爾教授（Janae　Eendall）所著『BreathaFrealy』作者　任英國　格蘭愛丁堡大學化學敎授，歐戰時任聯軍化學部隊　絡將授。</p>
<p>坊間流行書籍之描寫下次世界大戰時大都市平民在空襲下所受之慘禍者，每故甚其詞，或謂　彈從天而降，毒氣即　漫全城，或謂飛機結隊而來，撤佈「死霧」，申謂有新發明之奇異毒氣，足致人於死，而非任何防毒面具所能抵禦者，繪影繪聲，至足駭人。然吾以一化學師之　格敢斷言此等盡屬讕言也。</p>
<p>就余所知科學家輩最近無重要之新毒氣發現，卽將來亦恐不易發現。毒氣殺人之力，科學家於歐戰前早已知之至詳（氯氣發現于一七七四年，光氣于一八二年，芬子氣于一八五〇年）。而現在化學家輩則預料此十年間當無較芥子氣更列之毒氣發現，卽或有之，則以其危險　旣烈。恐終不能大規模製造也。一九一八年八月歐戰未已，美國瑪里蘭（Maryland）其芥子氣製造廠中化學戰爭服務團。其中因製造該氣而受毒者其數竟超過同時在西戰場上作戰人數與該團等之任何部之傷亡率，而央國在阿奉　（Aconmonth）芥子氣製造廠內全體一千一百名職員中，數月之間竟無一能免受毒者。</p>
<p>至謂毒氣能透過防毒面具，此亦未是爲慮，蓋以科學新法，吾人現用防毒面具中所用之活性炭，實能吸收任何重氣之微小份子，目在一定期間內復能抗拒一切較輕之氣。如氯氣及光氣等，若木炭內再雜入　打（Sodallme）則　抗毒力當更可持久，故防毒向具內遞毒設　實可抵禦任何毒氣也。</p>
<p>世之故作驚人之論者，謂空襲大都市如倫敦者必得成功，此等人幻想大隊之轟炸機　數千噸毒氣，而城內人民旣無防備，復豕突狼奔不知所措，有某將軍寫倫敦一旦受襲擊之情形謂：『城內人　必驚擾數日，醫院擁塞，交通斷絕，全城將成　怖地獄，當局將爲惶亂之情形所影　，而無所措于，此時敵人乃提出　和條件，於是政府急不暇擇而逕予接受矣』。惟就事實觀之，則近世防毒方法之邁進實遠勝於施放毒氣之方法，設非突如其來不及防避　外，則受毒者必少也。</p>
<p>據余所知以測，若倫敦被襲之情形大約當如下述：</p>
<p>戰端將啓、政府即發給防毒　具與人民，人各二具，出入携帶，兒童持之上課，成人携之工作，待大隊敵機已近倫敦之　息一至，則警號人鳴，市民走　室中，預備　具，一聞特別警號卽立刻戴上，半小時後，毒性最烈之芥子氣由空中，量放下，然街上行人早已逃避一空，故除因炸彈擊中屋宇或在旁爆炸致碎片擊中破壞玻　窗外，城內居民絕不感受毒氣，而毒氣彈放落後數分鐘內，消毒隊隨至，一小時後，市民聆號卸下面具，惟仍留居室中，待各段安全警號發出時始恢復經常行動，數小時內倫敦城繁，情形，一復舊觀矣，待後報章揭載，是役有數百市民經已送入醫院，其中多數爲小孩而大率受毒極微，至于二三十名不幸死亡者，則因被大片彈片擊傷也。至所謂『死霧」實亦幻想之尤，據謂人隊敵機可以在高空中不動聲息，施放此種毒氣，而此毒氣　放時渺小不可見，遇物則爆炸，防不勝防，惟據有經驗之專家言；施放毒　流　時飛機之飛行高　最多不得過三百尺，故如城市略有空防設備，卽無須恐懼毒氣之襲擊也。</p>
<p>恐怖論者每喜提文一噸芥子氣即山致四千五百萬人於死地之事實，惟此乃指此四千五百萬人結隊等候受毒　言也，夫如是，設倫敦市　皆自動臥下，則一輛輾路機亦可壓死全市內之居民矣，惟人見輾路機來鮮有惶然而不知趨避者。</p>
<p>在理想條　下，即在無風之平原上，七噸光氣亦僅能於圓徑五　碼高度十五尺之空間內，保持其致人死命之濃度，毒氣施放于城市之中，其爲害之小當可想見，憶一九二八年五月德國漢堡（Hambvrg）城內，因爆炸而有十一噸光氣洩出，結果十二人死亡，十二人中毒，一百六十人受微毒，當時城內居民未得警號，仍在街中　來，目又未帶備防毒面具也，使人民留居室中，配帶面具，而室內復有相當空防設備者，則除氣彈擊中屋宇爆炸外，當不致受害也。</p>
<p>據某化學專家在其空防小册子中所述謂：吾人對于空襲實不足長，蓋歐戰時法國農民居近前線者，遇毒氣來則　避室中，緊閉窗戶·待毒氣過而後出，當時彼蜚固未嘗有任何防毒設備，然卒能避免損害。</p>
<p>吾人對予毒氣攻襲之備防，不在其毒而在其所引起人心之浮動，蓋敵人施放毒氣于一城市時，其目的初不在殺害人民，而欲使人民驚惶失措渴望和平而已，故吾人在敵人空襲時及其前後第一必須切記勿妄目驚擾！</p>

<p>慕尼黑會義以後，法國現任達拉第內閣追隨張伯倫的妥協外交反動政策，曾經使法國從歐洲一等强國降到第二三國家的地位。可是達拉第內閣現在還在繼續執行其反動政策，據今天巴黎電訊，他們一面已經派出比拉德氏至西班矛叛軍所在地蒲爾哥斯與意大利指揮下的西叛軍私通欵曲，一面密派安南銀行總裁巴　榮到羅馬與意談判法意妥協。這種反動政策直接犧牲西班牙民主共和國，同時亦將使法國於地位低熟之後再加上殖民　的割讓！</p>
<p>拉達第內　是法國獨佔資本的代理人，他們心目中只有藉出費與戰爭以便私人發財，根本不會顧到國家利益，更不會顧到世界和平！現在的問題，就在法國人民對反動政策容忍到什麽程度？就在法國人民陣綫如何在金融資本的武力之下掙扎起來。推翻達拉第內閣，產生眞正代表人民的內閣。意大利指揮下的四叛軍，距法國邊境只有三十公里了！法國人民不能讓法國永遠屈服下去！</p>
<p>墨索里演詞</p>
<p>意大利侵略者的法西斯最高會議於四日晚開幕，首相舉索里尼發表演說及報吿，全文尙未發表，但一般觀察，除了對於德國帮助意國侵略表示讚美之外，似不致有驚人的地方。這當然是受了美國和蘇聯當局最近表示積極援助民主國的影響所致。不過我們不能就此認定意大利不會再有驚人之舉，不，當意大利全部征服西班牙之後，他們必更與德國及日本勾結發動更大的暴行，五日美國海陸軍紀事報所稱西戰停止後，德意必將有新的要求提出，實爲依據意　內外危機事實的推斷。只有一個辦法可以防止意德新的要求，那就是英法兩國迅速聯合蘇美，從積極挽救西班牙民主國開始！</p>
<p>囚犯集中營</p>
<p>本港當局現感囚犯日多，各監獄多已超過原定限額，現取法世界各地建集中營收容囚犯辦法，並將各種政府工程分派囚犯祖任，以代獄中苦工。</p>
<p>資本主義社會發展，囚犯的增多是必然的結果，在整個社會沒有改造之前，對於日益增多的囚犯安置問題，實有益趨嚴重之勢，固不僅本港二地爲然。現在建築集中營，自爲安置辦法之一一，因爲既可節省政府公帑，又可實行監獄制度的改善。不過鑒於過去各國囚犯集中營的弊害，爲事前補救計，第一是應該改善及推進囚犯的敎育一，至少使囚犯有讀報，俾獲知世界大勢；第二是改良囚犯的生活，給以相當體育與更人道的物質生活。</p>

<p>— 蔡魯生</p>
<p>抗戰以來，跟着厦門和廣州的陷落，華南沿海岸綫的被×人所大肆騷擾，香港——這「避難」的『樂園』，由於各地的難民像潮水似地擁至，便人口在急劇地激增起來，一切的日常用品，都因求過於供而使物價飛騰；更因內地的交通梗塞，來源幾絕而隨時呈現不敷和缺乏。</p>
<p>託居在這匯率高漲，生活程度日高一日的「樂園」中，除了是有產　級之外，難民和「凖難民」們，普通的生活本來就已經不易支持，再加以圖發「國難財」的商人們的操縱壟斷，在所謂「米珠薪桂」的畸形狀態之下，窮苦階層的生活，更是窘困不堪了！</p>
<p>現在，單從鬧了許久還沒有得到解决的一「柴荒」來談談，就有很多被大人先生們忽略的「小問題」。</p>
<p>這佔若「開門七件」中重要的一件的柴薪，它的價値，在香港，以前　　當便宜的　　普遍每一塊錢就可以購買一百多斤，但現在因着需要的增加，作爲來源的內地又因交通閉塞而斷絕，從「星加坡」和「山打根」等處運來的，又因運費過高而成本昂貴，影響所及，所有的柴價就飛漲了一倍，而且還有供不應求之勢。</p>
<p>因爲柴的缺乏，和它的價値已成『高不可攀」的結果，一般購買力有限的家庭，——或是難民和一凖雖民一們，爲了經濟的問題，而常將向來不被注意的破蓆子，舊木屐，木屑，爛紙……等，都加以「珍視」，而搬堆灶前，以至於把它送進灶社。有時，也會在門口買些好像從土裏發掘出來的，被白蟻蛀成百孔千瘡的爛木頭：或是一些由一山老鼠」們偷盜得來的林木；價値當然比較便宜一點。但這類偷來的林木，是祗有那些住在比較荒僻的地方的人家才敢買受，可是也常因傳言「差人」們要來檢奄私柴，而一做賊心虛」地大批加以拋棄。</p>
<p>依照我們這些「外江佬」看來，這具有熱帶風的香港，樹林山草，都非常暢茂，到處滿是柴薪，再鬧什麽「柴荒」？但住久了就會知道，這些都是「皇家」的「野」、不但不許人們採伐，而且設有許多專司保護林木的「差人」來看管着。要是有盜伐林木而被捉着的話，那就要受判處罰欵或被監禁的處分。所以，除了少數以偷柴爲業的一山老鼠一、和窮苦階層的人，盜取一些來出賣或是用外，生活比較過得　的人，當然不敢也不願意去幹這種「觸犯刑章」的勾當。</p>
<p>在稍爲荒僻的山林地帶，『偷柴』的事是常常有得發見的，每當夕陽西下的幕色中，就時常可以看見一些沙塵遍體的窮苦男女，幾個人一組的，肩挑背負着那一偷來」的一些爛木殘枝，像驚弓之烏似的，從山上的小徑裏偷偷溜下來。雖然那些爛木殘枝的「被偷」，損不了這島上的什麼「風景」，但要是不幸碰着了看護林木的「差人」，那就非吃官司——坐苦監不可。</p>
<p>不久之前，筆者曾見過一個鶉衣百結的窮苦婦人，拿了一些拾來的，應該是並不怎樣「犯法」的幾段爛枯的小樹枝，和幾隻破木屐，正行行於臨海的岸上，冷不防給一位『差人』先生看了，她因驚恐過度，在逃跑與掙扎中，不知怎麽一來，她竟失足撞入了汚黑臭濁，深可沒頸的港裏去。這時，岸上就立刻圍上許多來看「熱鬧」的人，那婦人淋漓地佔在海裏，浸着冰冷過　的海水，她抖顫着，她慘然望着岸上的人；望着威風凜凜的『差人』，她始終看不見一隻同情的手，她窮苦，她無助，她『犯法』，她的淚水像泉水似的湧流着。在絕望，一切都是絕望中，她不願再悲慘地活下去了，她猛然轉身鑽入海中，整個人不見了，這時，岸上看「熱鬧」的人才騷動起來，都急得大叫：救人呀！救人呀！</p>
<p>在那婦人的生死已判于頃瞬間，一位靑年再也看不過這幕慘劇，他不顧自己服裝的什麼「莊嚴」奮身躍入海裏。他好容易抓着婦人的長髮，費了九牛二虎之力，才算將婦人救了囘來，但　婦人因飲了滿肚子的海水，已經面如土色，不省人事，結果還終於被抬去「報案」了！</p>
<p>還有一次，那是在一儸已將人夜的晚上，筆者住處郊近的公路旁邊的　凹裏，正圍繞着一羣拾荒囘來的衣不蔽體的苦孩子，他們每個人的手臂上都掛着一只空空的畚箕，眼淚晶瑩地望着一天辛苦得來的爛枝，桔皮和敗葉等，給拘獲而聚之付之一炬，然而這應該是比較很『慈悲』的一幕了。</p>
<p>『柴荒』！「柴荒」要是沒有辦法解决：依然荒着下去的話，那麽很多令人看了不十分『順眼』的悲劇。是會繼續不斷而且與日俱增地演下去的——雖然問題是不僅限於『柴荒』那樣簡單。</p>

<p>冒着刺骨的凄風，飲着冰寒的苦雨，在生活底鞭策下，深夜裏還　抖搜精神，縮瑟在寂寞的街頭而掙扎的手車佚，可算得是繁榮都市裏勞苦羣衆最悲凄的工作者了！</p>
<p>手車，在這個大時代的齒輪嚼嚼之下，逐漸步上淘汰的階段，不久之將來，終於要和馬車一樣的成爲陳迹，僅在世界交通發達史裏留下一頁紀載吧！</p>
<p>在這兒，有小敦倫之稱，而還得保持着封建時代遺下特殊色彩的香島，手專業之所以　久延殘喘地繼續下去，給遠方遊客來欣賞一下遠東帶獨有的工業，自然是香港的一個奇蹟，它之不爲交通工具的洪流（巴士或稱長途汽車）所吞沒，並不是本身具有了不得的特殊交通效能，它的唯一續命湯，據說是曾經効勞過當地的『皇家』才能特別恩准留存到現在，在本港山頂區方面的手車夫是在空前絕後（？）的世界大戰時爲人道而自動參加工作者的後裔，至于九龍方面，由官　至敦道一帶的手車夫，則更是一九二六年之役効勞港府得特殊功動，他們由那時起，一直保持着拖車工作到而今，他們的原籍大都是海陸豐人，這次九龍車夫，請求『批頭』減車租的事件，也是發生在這官涌帶的手車夫羣中。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的，在過去的習慣手車夫都是直接向對海五大手車主租車營業，每天的租在四毫半至五毫之間，從一九二七年到現在，也沒有多大變動，單獨在最近有石顏××的「批頭」（意思是由車主承租大批車輛轉租給手車夫者）把名下十九輛手車的租　，抬高到八毫許，車夫平添了這筆重担，每日把血汗勞力賺得來的錢，餘掉車租以外所得的餘款，不足以維持生活，那末，不得不要求「批頭」減輕一些。經過了雙方幾次的談判之下，「批頭一還沒有減輕車租的願意，結果這羣勞苦人衆，卒於向華民政務司投訴，請求主持公道，經過幾次的調解，直至今年二月一日，才吿一段落。</p>
<p>據聞這次調解的結果，勞工們卒進得最後勝利，這十九輛手車，顏××只准許繼續承批一季（至四月一日止），到期時交還顏××和顏××兩大車主，以後各手車夫照舊營業，可以直接向車主和車，車相和其他的一樣，不能抬高，不過要繳納港幣六元的按金，用途是防止欠租金，待至退租時，方許收回，</p>
<p>這一風潮，得到了解决，手車夫表面上雖獲得最後勝利，但過去在交涉過程中，車夫們仍須按日繳租八毫八仙，直至本年四月一日為止，這筆意外的損失，依然落在車夫身上，那是無所補償了！　（民）</p>

<p>— 柯紹明</p>
<p>渴望許久、終歸得到了一個七天的假期、事先我們再三的籌劃、怎樣利用這短少的假期去從來沒有到過的地方遊歷、變換一下日常生厭的環境、但這問題總沒有一個完滿的解决、因爲時間所限、遠的地方不能去、近的地方十之八九曾經遊覽、同時還東烽火連天、許多地方欲去不能、結果得了旅行社的指示、乘汎美航空公司的飛剪號機岷尼拉、在那裏遊覽碧瑤與及北山寒瀑布、星期四前往、下星期三趁從三藩市飛來的西航機返港、需時僅六日、來囘旅費包括膳宿遊覽、每人祗需港幣四百九十元、這樣低廉的代價、遊覽遠東著名的碧瑤山與及趁兩次世界馳名的飛剪號、毫不遲疑地我們把這計劃實現了、</p>
<p>星期四早晨七時一刻、我們在九龍半島飯店集合、乘航空公司預備的漂亮公共汽車往啓德飛行塲、查騐護照以及客人行李過磅之後、我們乘兩分鐘的汽艇登巨型的飛剪號機、因爲它浮泊在水面·離岸三四白礪，郵件客人俱用汽艇轉駁、這次所乘的是夏威夷飛剪號、（該機距作者乘後數星期遇事失踪）、是美國馬田廠出品、裝有八百匹馬力的引擎四具、每小時航行一百五十英里、載旅客二十八名、豋機後照購票時的號碼依次就坐、機分上下兩層、上層是駕駛室、無線電司機室、以及安放郵件行李燃料等雜物、下層前部是機長室、職員室、當中大部份是客艙、尾部是盥洗室以及廚房、舒適的座位晚上可以變成臥鋪、但這航線除了從三藩市到檀香山外、不用夜間飛行、臥舖祗有那段路程適用、八時半起航後、俯瞰香港以及環繞香港九龍的無數大小島嶼、煞是奇觀、祗那一剎間、已很値得我們這次飛航、雖然在高空八千尺上、除了發動機聲音有點刺耳外、與乘坐汽車不覺有怎樣的區別、當日港報以及美國新出版雜誌任客人閱讀、坐在安樂椅中、外觀宇宙的奇景、不知不覺已是午時、在機上吃了一頓精美的午餐、午後二時抵達岷尼拉、乘汽車往指定的旅館休憇、那旅館建築設備都很新式、而且適合熱帶、安放好了行李之後、我們步行遊覽、岷市的街道、整齊淸潔、樹木參天、住宅區更覺幽美無比、人行其中、如置身公園內、那便是岷尼拉的新城、原來岷尼拉有新舊城之分、歐美人士新式商店銀行旅社多在新城、舊城是西班牙人所建、多居土著、看了一回落日、返囘旅館、因爲落日在岷市是奇景之一、</p>
<p>翌日乘汽車遊覽全市、先至舊城、街道整潔、不及新城、屋宇參差、很不一樣、城垣外的濠溝、經已塡成平地、變成哥爾夫球塲、參觀岷尼拉大敎堂菲列濱大學、博物院等處、可惜我們對菲列濱的歷史沿革、不甚熟識、否則這囘遊歷更會增加趣味不少、</p>
<p>本來我們預算第三天早晨遊北山寒Pagsanjan瀑布、卽夜囘岷、後來聽了別人的勸吿、北山寒遊玩適宜於上午、可避太陽熱力之苦、而且午前奇景、變幻萬千、過午便失原來面目、於是當日前去、在北山寒瀑布憩宿一宵、早上起床、略進早點、換好了游泳衣、頭戴闊邊笠帽、步行至江岸、登獨木製的小舟、每舟僅坐一人、但舟的前後、有經驗豐富的舟子二、把舵掉槳、起先在湖裏泛掉、沒有可異的地方、惟四圍峭壁、高可三四百尺、椰樹遍生巒上、泛了一陣水流急速起來、發見許多瀑布、我們的小舟逆流而下、危險萬分、稍一不愼、便有覆舟之虞，縱使你怎樣善于游泳、然總不能抵抗那些急流、幸舟子們皆有豐富的經驗、經過了無數的急灘、遇了五次以上的驚險、同時又聽見猿猴的哀鳴聲、史增加心內的難過、經過了兩小時後、纔抵達一個平靜的內湖，休憩片刻、沿來路而返、那回小舟順流而下舟子雖沒有來時那樣辛苦、而危險的程度反過之、心驚蕩魄、歷一小半後返原處，（比來時少半句鐘（大衆透了一口氣到旅館更衣、乘汽車沿另一條路返岷中、</p>
<p>第四天早晨六時三十分乘菲列濱航空的士公司皮來卡機往碧瑤、那機身很小規模遠不及飛剪號、僅容乘客四名、飛行的高度從一千尺至七千五百尺、一小時後抵達碧瑤、碧瑤是遠東著名的避暑區、雖在盛暑，猶服秋衣、據說、居住的人、是依靈格埃、文化低下、兇悍異常、與菲列濱人完全兩樣、不久以前、尙有殺戳白人的事發生、我們得友人的介紹寄寓鄉村俱樂部、先至市墟觀看、見那些依靈格人沒有傳聞那樣駭怕、興遊客亦頗親近、他們用木器雕成人頭、向遊容兜售、我們購了幾具、與及一些木器雕刻以留念、因爲碧瑤是遊客足跡常到之地、公路以及設備完善的旅社很多、倘若不乘飛機、從岷市趁公共汽車四五小時便可抵達、當局又闢了幾個完備的哥爾夫球塲、馴服的馬匹、可以租賃、我們馳騁一陣、返鄉村俱樂部休息、</p>
<p>第五日趁昨日乘來的皮來卡機返岷尼拉、再事遊覽、晚間又到熱鬧的街上觀光</p>
<p>第六日我們乘從三藩市西來的中國飛剪號返港、沒有到香港之前、那機在澳門停靠汎美公司爲我們僱汽車遊覽全埠、停留約五十分鐘、繼續飛航、下午一時十分抵達啓德飛行塲、</p>
<p>從香港到個碧瑤、倘若是乘飛機、第一天到岷尼拉、第二天換機至碧瑤、乘輪船需三四日、兩日兩岷市、改火車或公共汽車到碧瑤、</p>

<p>— 孫恩霖</p>
<p>兩年前到陜北去，交通上雖比較現在爲方便，但在人事上却沒有現在痛快。囘想當時的情景，尙有値得重述的地方。我目把從西安到膚施途中的經過，就記憶所及的寫出來。關於人物和政治等問題，一則時過境遷，已成往事；再則本文以遊目騁懷為主旨，只重趣味，不涉其他，一概從略了。</p>
<p>正是江南春光明媚的節季，我們——兪頌華君和我——到了西安的第二天，就碰着數十年來未有的大風沙。從西京招待所的樓窗外望，呼呼的大風，捲着黃沙在空中打旋，不見天，不見地；一片黯淡灰黃的景色，使這古老的長安城，顯得格外的枯燥和寡歡。</p>
<p>大風之後，繼以下雨，西北的粘士路，着了雨不能走車輛，所以直遲到第四天纔啟程往陜北去。事先我們在「七賢莊」那裏接洽好，附搭了運糧汽車出發。從西安到膚施，平均兩天可到，可是這些迷貨車，大半已上了些年紀，而且又負着數千磅的糧秣，像一匹贏浴的老牛，雖經鞭策，亦已愛莫能助了。我們是四十四日早晨從西安出發，到十六下午纔抵達膚施。</p>
<p>那天往陝北去的大汽車共有五輛，翁君和我分佔了兩輛汽車駕駛座旁的一個位置、我們在沒動身之前、已經打聽得沿途旅行食宿的簡陋，並且還承招待我們者方面的好意。先對我們說明：『恐怕你們兩先生不慣，能够自備被褥和雜用品更好。』我們於是託了招待所的周君，租了四條棉被，並購置了箝毛毯，面盆，漱口杯，風鏡，手電筒，熱水瓶，罐頭食物等，兪君還置辦了些香烟，——其中有淡味的「三砲台」烟——我撿點行裝時，又將從上海帶去的牛乳麥精粉，方糖，麥麵姘干等一起放到網籃裏。起初我們覺得眞慚愧，爲什麽我們不能過幾天最簡陋的生活呢？可是事後我們又覺得，在這『天荒地老」的陜北旅行，帶一些烟、上坡時不至倒退或滑脫。</p>
<p>好容易爬上了山頂，汽車要添水修理，車夫要休息，我們也趁此下車走走，舒絡筋骨。山頂是一片平坦的士地，這眞出於我們的意料。我們吸着紙燜，喝着帶來的開水，在這四圍奇幻景象的山顚上踱方步。舉目一看，許多的山巓都是削平的，好像放着無數的大圓檯，檯面上却空無所有；有些山顯着巨大的創痕——似乎瘋神在那裏打架，經過巨靈之掌所抓破的，一縷縷的痕跡，非常明顯，又像大自然間燃着巨燭，流下來的燭淚堆成了無數的奇蹟。羣山雖然靜立着不動，而我們的眼睛，當注視着這個山，或那個山稍久了，便似有許多鴻荒巨獸，隨着我們指間繚繞的烟霧，冉冉上昇，在山嶺巨谷間跳躍着；愈看愈不淸楚，幻狀，雲霧……忽然聽到汽車夫喊道：「車子弄好了，大家上車走罷！』我們便把渺小的香煙拋擲在萬丈深谷中，重新踏上我們的征程</p>
<p>在宜君附近地勢最高，上坡下坡，經過幾十次的上落顚簸，纔到達了離開延安最近的洛川、歇宿過夜、在途間，我們除了領略這大地黃沙，貧瘠之區的陜北景色外，沿途也曾碰到許多樸實的老百姓，在車子上，往往看見一輛笨拙的牛車。迎面而來。汽車之不能讓牛車，眞像那市裏的人看不起鄕下人一般，於是操將重濁口音的陝北人，便很着急的跳下車來，使勁的拖那牛避向道旁，牛的頭腦愈不淸楚，鄕人的情狀，愈爲着急。他一面恐怕汽車輾傷那牲口，或撞翻了車上的東西——無非是些煤塊，草料，或木柴之類，而一面又聽得慣走快路的汽車夫們在那裏護罵，那種狼狽可憐的情狀，從他『想盡方法』的舉動中，不斷的流露出來。有些鄕人，趕着背上馱有煤塊的騾子，在山道中馳騁着，口中噓噓作聲，趕那牲口快快的跑，他們一天奔跑幾十里路，把那笨重而不値錢的煤塊賣掉，而所得的酬報還不到數十糖，茶，或水菓之類，却有不可思議的妙處哩！</p>
<p>「渭陽古渡」憧憬在我們的眼前了。在沒有到達之三原前，我們先要渡過這歷史上著名的渭河和涇河。河面上有架着的木榆，看上去已是不甚結實，幸虧橋頭下橫着些方頭木舟，承着橋面，做了中流的砥柱。我們看見這種情形，心裏未免惴惴，好在同車的人，都有此感，大家下車步行，走過橋面。那汽車夫們却不顧一切，一輛輛的過對岸去了、許多騾馬手車之類。有的利用方頭式渡船過河，有的也從橋面上走過去。渭河裏的水本來很混濁，流量也不湍急，在南方人的目光中，這種河道還値得留戀麽？但是自從過了涓，涇，一直到延安，沿途除了很少溪流之外，却沒有寬大的河道了。</p>
<p>在耀縣過了一宿，此去到第二歇足站的洛川，中間要經過同官，宜君，和中部——黃帝陵所在的地方——地勢漸漸的高起來，汽車道忽而低，忽而高，翻山過嶺，盤旋着行走。一路觸於眼簾的，全是赭赤和灰黃的士山，這裏所說的土山，眞不要小看它，並不是指平淡的小阜，或隨便堆着的泥土而言。那是許多怪奇的幻景，有時多看了，幾乎要令人發瘋似的，這許多黃沙土，據地質學家言。是在幾千年前，由中亞細亞的大風，把沙土從蒙古一帶朝東吹來，久而久之，便成了現在的奇象。汽車從山谷中上昇異常吃力，軋軋仔的呌聲，分明吿訴人家，它已是萬分的盡職了。然而車夫更要盡職，脚踏着最高率的排擋，開着最大度的催速機，這可憐的汽車，就拚着它最後的一滴血，來和這峻峭的山坡當鬬。當然比人走路還要慢，一步挨着一步前進，我所坐的一輛運貨車，除了車夫之外，還帶了一個助手，這時候他的工作緊張極了，他手裏提了一個巨大的木槌，汽車上坡的時候，遇到最危急，而要「脫力」的當兒，他便把這大木槌塡嵌在後車輪下面，這樣纔帮助了這負責而年老的汽車，在個銅子哩。</p>
<p>陝北人的生活可用四種顏色——紅，黃，灰，黑，來表示。住的是窰洞，——黃土山中所開的洞，吃的是粗麵條或硬饅首，灰而發黃。佐以紅色的辣椒醬，灰色的鹽。穿的衣服，雖然原來不是黑色的，但是因爲缺少水，而又蒙上許多灰沙黃土。島油油的不黑也黑了。一切的一切，似乎不能再簡單、再陋略了。如果人的財產服飾住屋等？能以厚度來計算的話，那末陜北人民除了一個赤裸的身子外，他們身上所蒙着的，祗是一層蓮膜而已。</p>
<p>在洛川碰到無線電台主任劉君，武進人，和電報局長陳君，寧波人，在離開江浙江幾千里路外，他們遇到我們江南人，自然是分外的高興；而我們呢，雖然離開上海不過一星期之久，因爲環境的變換太劇烈而太速了，竟像離開家鄉已經有幾年，一見之下，也覺得有「他鄉遇故知」之感。</p>
<p>在下午淡薄的陽光照射在延安城牆上，而將要西散的時候，我們進了這個古城，因爲那裏已經得到西安的通知，就有人來招待我們在賓館裏住下，臥的雖是土坑，吃的雖是灰色饅首，然而碰到的却是些有名的人物，他們做着許多繁複艱難的工作，度着最簡單，最低微的生活。</p>
<p>夜來臨了，我鬥從街上回來，沒有煤氣燈，更沒有電燈，許多老百姓小販們，在微弱的燭光和油燈下做賈賣，他們出售粗製的手工品，硬饅首，麵，餅，和一些菜蔬之類。馬路上也相當的熱閙，不過七八點鐘時候。這市集就散了。黑暗和冷靜，交織在延安的街道上，因爲那裏的人，雖有武噐，而不一定穿皮鞋，除了遠遠聽見隱約的口令聲音，和黑暗中看見雪亮的手電筒光亮外，就不知道還有人在漆黑的馬路上行走哩，這是延安之「夜」。</p>

<h3 id="c51">消滅我蠶絲業之陰謀 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 吳馬</p>
<p>攫奪戰區的絲廠、無暇顧到種塲方面、一方面也因當製種界還沒有像無錫的張子珍、錢　高聲的敗類、雖然也有與僞政府中互通聲氣的人、但整個地說、還能保持中華民國蠶種製造塲的尊嚴骨氣、這是一年來戰區蠶種界在這種苦難環境下忍辱奮鬥的評價、</p>
<p>可是淪陷區究竟是淪陷區、日人對中國整個的陰謀終究是兇狠惡毒的、而尤孝標、（僞江蘇省政府建設廳第二科科長兼技正、兼蠶業取締所所長、實際上係偽蘇省政府蠶業行政之最高權威者）之沭、也終不過是搖頭擺尾的漢奸、要想在淪陷區裏一本以往的方針繼續經營蠶種製造事業、或者要想在尤孝標之流的卵翼之下、維持蠶種製造場的地位、甚至藉機得些利益、都是夢囈、因爲事業上、（一）覆巢之下無完卵、（二）奴才們也决無干預『主子』（？）和參加末議的權力與膽量、這是戰區蠶種業界應該充分認識淸楚的兩個前提、</p>
<p>從而、我們進一步的來討論、『華中蠶絲公司』最近的戰區蠶種製造業界的進攻、</p>
<p>二·五個滅亡的條件</p>
<p>在最近，「華中蠶絲公司」爲實行統制戰區的蠶種業、以遂其提取或是毀滅整個江浙的蠶絲業起見、巳向素被稱爲江浙牌子最老範圍最大的滸墅關大有蠶種製造場提出「合作」、這是日方對戰區糧塲的第一砲、無疑的是要推行到江浙戰區的全體種場、合作的條件是暫擬五條、茲摘錄如下、</p>
<p>（一）原種向公司購買、不得複製或轉讓、</p>
<p>（二）由公司委派技術指導，場方支付薪給、</p>
<p>（三）毒率不得超過千分之三、</p>
<p>（四）製造之蠶種、由公司銷售、不得自行出售或轉讓他人、種欵以交種時付一半、其餘春種於七月後、秋種於十月後付淸、</p>
<p>（五）發出蠶種、成績不良時、由塲方負責賠償、</p>
<p>五個條件之中、尤以第一條第四條和第五條爲最狠毒、第二第三兩條、不過是這三條的輔助、茲再爲分析於後、</p>
<p>關於第一條、實任包含着三個險惡的意義、第一、當然是統制戰區的蠶品種、使幾個較大的種塲原來培育的優良品種趨於消滅、這樣一來、一方面各種場非與「華中蠶絲公司」合作、即無法獲得原種飼育、以製造普通蠶種、換言之：卽唯日人是賴、那末、蠶絲的存在與消滅、也可由日方原種的供給與否、而完全操於日人之手了、第二、日本自從戰爭以來、卽限制羊毛輸人、但因爲日本羊毛生產的貧瘠、不得不另謀補救方法、於是有所謂繭質羊毛、即以繭經化學藥品處理後、使近似羊又之一種纖維、）之提倡、但毛因充作繭質羊毛之原料繭、不但不必如製絲原料蘭般之優良、且反以不堪製絲綿繭爲適用、故在國內提倡飼育之後、卽遭製絲業界之劇烈反對、理由爲此種下等原料繭一提倡、對於充作製絲用之優良蘭的生產、勢必大受影響也、所以日人如果統制江淅戰區的原種、使各種塲都購買他們的產品、當然有乘機將此類品種輸入戰區、一則可使戰區中的國人代他們生產原料、以遂其榨取的目的、再則更可緩和國內製絲業界的反對、第三是日人素視中國爲其蠶絲敵國、因爲中國土地廣漢、人力豐富蠶絲業尙有偉大的發展可能、日本則適得其反、正唯其如此、對日本的蠶絲王國的威脅也最大、所以日本政府在中國蠶絲業主要地帶的江浙失陷之後、就一而再、再而三的派遣國內蠶絲學界的權威、如東高蠶的木暮、福本、上田的林貞三等、先後來調査視祭、以冀獲得一個整個的對華蠶絲方策、當時、日本的論調有整個消滅與開發的二種、可是現在日人的陰謀、却是採用了開發的消滅、就是在江浙等戰區、行統制的開發、除掉日人之外、華方無對其他外國發生買賣的關係、使華絲在世界消費市場的地位、締於消滅、道樣、旣無虞於華絲與日絲的競爭、又可獲得戰區中蠶絲業的寶藏、戰區中的原種一統制、當然這個目的不難達到、最淺顯的例、就是如果把不堪製絲的蠶品種推行到戰區，則上海的絲廠和戰區的小絲廠、就無法也不屑收取戰區中生產的原料繭、因爲這種繭子巳不是製絲所需的原料了、這就是日人大聲疾呼的所謂「樹立百年大計」的百年大計呀、亦即是日政府所謂「經濟合作」的面員、　（未完）</p>

<p>（本報專訊）東方會之足球鬥士、邇來殊進步、遂乃有前週力克南華南於聯賽、昨日與南華華之特別銀脾重賽、又吿大捷、而獲凖决賽權、</p>
<p>昨日東方之大勝、劉顯漢應居首功、蓋昌上半塲開始之十分鐘內、南華攻勢極盛、陳德輝、楊水益、區仕諤等、先後得機而妙射、勢將必破門而入者、凡數次之多其時顯漢獨能於駭浪驚濤中、力挽狂瀾、卒保不失、家因之使全隊得捩聯之機、致有侯澄滔乘隙反攻之得手、故顯漢之功、高於一切也、</p>
<p>上半塲之戰局、南華原多得勢、祗以厄於顯漢之手、望門興嘆、如當其進攻甚亟之際、能獲球在先、則十氣一振、形勢更好、或不致有第一二　疏忽之失、惟得失之數、有時非人力所能為者、而戰爭之變化無窮、尤不可逆料也、</p>
<p>東方各員表演、以顯漢、澄滔特佳外、其餘亦稱職、尢以防禦方面得度過初期之危險、至足稱道、故其首二兩球排云得之於　會凑合、然全軍精神之一致、則非南華所司及、卒獲大勝、固非無因也、</p>
<p>至於南華敗蹟、咎在守力不堅、林德譜負傷登塲、表失色、游華興則盲踢盲傳、復無以阻澄滔之進展、故整個能衛　、祗有謝錦洪强差人意、因而進退失擄、支撑不起、東方遂得以收乘隙而攻之效、</p>
<p>劉茂、劉偉培、更無善足陳、屢次誤事、蓋第一二兩球之失、皆因二氏疏忽所致、惟第二球譚均幹接而復漏、亦不能辭　咎、</p>
<p>某君語弛者曰、南華之敗、雖屬守者之過、但最大原因、尙在編陣之錯誤、蓋右南衛一職、捨梁伯偉不用、而用有勇般謀之畢興、已是失語、其次德譜足傷未愈、原未可以上陣、乃又用之出應此車要之戰、亦屬自誤、故目敗也、乃敗於負食編陣者之手、未得完全歸咎於球人也、</p>

<p>【本報特訊】上海學生網球隊、前日與港大隊對抗、先施下馬威、大獲全勝、昨日下午一時半、在皇囿與南華會隊比賽、結果南華以三比二勝、</p>
<p>上海大學網球隊來港之後、閃事忙未嘗見其練習情形、前日又因觀南華南對外之特別銀牌　、未克分身訓赴薄扶林觀戰、心癢雖熬也、昨知彼輩於二時半與南華體育會中人、賽於京士柏南雜網球塲、乃先往一觀、而後轉看光華對外之足球戰、尙幸彼輩先作最好之兩　單打，吾遂得窺見唐寶嘉與李國璠演出之一斑、</p>
<p>計常時唐李二氏、同時在兩塲分戰陳志强與黃福南、吾又適　陳光耀氏請作唐陳一場之底線裁判、故僅能一談唐氏之藝、唐陳一塲先賽畢、雖亦嘗略賞觀李黃之賽、然僅見最後兩局、是以未敢　評李氏之藝、　能謂其短小精幹、亦稱得上穩健一字而已、至其些二者之球　如何、則　有俟　口得見乃再筆管見耳、蓋昨因分心於足球、未四時即離、後第三塲單打與雙目兩　均未嘗欣賞也、</p>
<p>唐實對陳志强之一場、兩人俱有碩健之身材、亦皆有猛擊之手法、可以謂之功力悉敵、但唐年輕、究欠歷練、目場地不熟、又適逢陳氏表演特好、故相形之下、遂似多　未及陳處、具連負六對三、六對三兩　、似連可代表二人昨日球藝之距離程度也、</p>
<p>唐氏爲可造村、後或有大進之望、然今則對來球之預測力、似過於迅捷、脚法亦常見　亂、反擊與高擊皆未見有何特殊高甚妙之演出、上網更未見工夫、蓋昨日被陳自强佔盡上風、絕不與以上網機會也、發球則第一球得手仍有可觀、第二球則弱甚、唯妙在有時能橫掃近界撇球、又善窺空急擊、PassB　11、長抽嫌由底抽出、去勢太高、茲未足以稱上乘、如不向脚上研究、恐難有長足之進步、救球　疾、氣力充足、則　其長處、若在現時之本港論、則十名以下人物而已、</p>
<p>昨賽陳志强先負二局、進回二對二、又敗二局、然後進囘三對四、即以三對六輸第一盤、第二盤先勝一局、乃戰成一對一、二對一、二對二、三對二、以後便連負四局、又以三六敗、李國　則以六對一六對四勝賞福南、　（球場舊侶）</p>

<p>（本報特訊）光華與聖約瑟、昨日下午四一刻、再度會師于九龍會塲、此乃甲組足球聯賽也、憶於第一戰時、光華曾以三比一將聖隊擊敗、昨天冉度遭遇、聖隊存雪恥之心、乃配足人馬上陣、名將大吿山奴、担任前鋒、比路度則司中堅之聯、故以實力論、聖隊似勝一籌、然而鏖戰結果、光華又以二比一告捷、誠傑作也、</p>
<p>是役聖隊之　綫、原甚活躍、常圍攻光華之門、水洩不通、中堅比路度演出、亦殊　妙、祗因內衞防守不堅、未　遏阻光華之進犯、此其致敗之原因、光華方面、李國、侯容生、卓石金、鄒文治諸子、均有極佳貢獻、遂因是奠定獲勝之基、鍾輝林之動作、則頗嫌遲滯、予人以　、幸國祺及容生、鎭壓得法、始得轉危爲安、前衞三將、亦算努力從事、但技術不足、致未能將對方之前歸、　于中路、前綫五將、皆舉動活潑、有諒解之合作、故得在此惡戰中、卒獲最後勝利也、</p>
<p>戰事旣啓、各呈智能、有可能、有頃、光華諸　、嘗兩度衝淮要　、惟卒以遇阻退囘、聖隊隨卽傾師來　、容牛大力闊斧、擊退來將、鏖戰移時、光華前、又復活躍、熾芬隻身盤球而進、瞬至腹地、思馬發士出阻犯規、被罰十二碼球、石　主踢、一射人網、聖隊員後、乃傾全力反攻、即兩內衛亦越中央線界、上前協助、劇戰五分鐘、光華頻生　險、幸全軍出命、乃得暫保原有陣地、旋石金突圍而出、沿邊進襲、幷演　兩　美妙之傳中、在後一次時、乃爲必勝之機、惜熾芬未能及時衝進、遂失之交臂、</p>

<p>娛樂！富家女的祕密</p>
<p>There　Goes　Heart</p>
<p>是一部美國式的笑片、故事的取材與及情節的編排、完全是爲達到喜劇的目的、導演出奇制勝的手法、在本片中給觀衆製作了不少新鮮的笑料、劇情的瘋狂諧趣、也很有引人人勝的力量、</p>
<p>片中描寫一個不經世故而渴慕自由的富家女的出走、同時怎樣的與一個記者在特殊的形境之下發生戀愛的故事、</p>
<p>弗德立馬區和薇琪尼白羅絲、都不是很高明的諸角、在片中沒有什麽成就、　出平平而已、潘倩凱莉明朗爽快、倒有很出色的表演、是一個可愛的　魚、南錫卡洛、飾演一個虛榮嫉妒的女店員、這是她重囘銀幕的第二次演作、成績還不錯、</p>
<p>皇后同映……</p>
<p>平安……英宮六十年</p>
<p>Sixty　Glotious　Years</p>
<p>本片同是寫英女王維多利亞一生的光榮史蹟、不過較前一部更爲詳盡而已、將她在位六十年中許多重要的功績、都包括在內了、爲　重與畢眞起見、特由英國皇家公司攝製、却多少　一點宣傳英國女王歷史的色彩</p>
<p>因爲素材特別豐富、而那種素材都　寶負、不容得　去或删去、那麽在這種情形之下、導演是不容易討好、及處理得當、本片就犯了這个毛病、全劇除前半部寫女皇婚後生活、稍見生動活潑，外、在後半部祇好家割據歷史片段、作爲機權的介紹而已、　也不能怪導演的丰腕了、</p>
<p>全　有幾個很優越的場面、如女皇婚後的生活、英國皇家軍的衝　、女皇舉行　禧紀念及後去看她的老宮女時、都値得提起的、演員方面、同前一部「英后偉史」沒有都大更動、飾女呈的安娜尼格兒、演出絕佳、尤其是在老年時、飾阿爾伯親王的安東華爾勃羅、也極優秀、</p>
<p>東方……及筓年華</p>
<p>That　Certafn　Age</p>
<p>這裏所描寫的是一個早熟的少女、她竟戀上了比她年紀大一倍條的記者、他起先並不知道、及後發覺是這麽一會事之後、極力想使她絕念、都不生效力、結果還是由另外一個女子來解了</p>
<p>無疑地、狄安娜賽萍在這本片中是更見得美麗了、不但是演出上的細膩與活潑、有着顯著的　步、男主角茂文陶格拉斯、非常稱職、像『巧女歌聲』裏的馬勃赫歇一樣、賈克古栢、仍留露着天眞的演技、</p>
<p>裏頭四支新歌、亦頗動聽、</p>
<p>太華……瑞士小姐</p>
<p>Swfss　Miss</p>
<p>老萊哈台折夥前最後第二部台滑稽片、故事寫一個賣鼠軋的商人、老萊哈台）、一次他們到瑞士去做生意、二個自作聰明的獃子、就閙了不少的笑話、有些地方果然是欠强、但也正爲是喜劇的緣故、</p>
<p>裏面尙有二個歐洲的歌唱家、參加表演、尤其是那個女子的歌很好、兩個寶貝的演出，同以前沒有兩樣</p>
<p>新世界……摩登女招夫</p>
<p>事語片</p>
<p>就是舞上的『摩登女招夫』所改編、劇情是叙述一個家產百萬的富翁、慳吝異常、對於一切公益事業、非但一毛不拔、反要想法來佔人家便宜、這時因爲各界發起籌欲建立華民工業後、想請他帮仃、可是結果他非但沒有拿出一點錢夾、反而在會議席上、油了幾件西點、於是衆人設法想出這『摩登女招夫』的辦法來、想他來上當、再用女色來誘騙他、</p>
<p>主處是舞　紅伶、馬師曾譚　卿、也是製片家的生意眼</p>
<p>關於導演的手法還相當說</p>
<p>中央……烏衣隊</p>
<p>粤語片</p>
<p>本片中所表現的、是社會中兩個懸殊的階級、一方面是勞苦的婦女大衆、另一方面則是一些有閒階級　者逸的老爺少爺們、但是導演對於各個情節的描寫、未免過求達到「香艷」的目的、而忽略了現實的表現、同時也爲了太求「香艷」的緣故、益使全片充滿　低級下流、調情胡閙的意味、</p>
<p>劇情描寫一　弱息女子、夫往外洋認生、家渡不良，迫她往外傭工、而受盡種種的欺侮壓迫、及夫榮歸、又發生種種誤會、</p>
<p>半部情卽鬆弛、且大部份以歌劇的形式演出、企圖掩飾內容的空、導演手法也嫌不够洗練、但是女主角黃曼麗、在本片中出色的表演、是不能埋沒而值得讚許的、</p>
<p>太平……粤劇</p>
<p>太平男女劇團</p>
<p>日演……暫停</p>
<p>夜演……痴心女</p>

<h3 id="c63">當心「民族扒手」 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 鐵光</p>
<p>五中王會閉會後，嚇人對於抗戰國策與國內團結的信賴，顯然是愈加堅定而結實。人們看到國民黨　於軍事，政治，文化，經濟，黨務，民運各方面，都有着更加明確的提示，尤其看到最高國防委員會的設立與人選問題的配置適當，都充份的加强着人們對於抗戰必勝，建國必成的信念。我們有權可以說，最高國防委員會的建立，乃是爭取最後勝利的一個最有活力的唯一領導機構；我們更有理由可以說，最高國防委員會的存在，它將隨着抗戰的持久而表揚着對於民族解放運動的光輝成就，因此，今後應當如同去執行最高國防委員會的種種指示，這乃是我們推動抗戰，斃　抗戰一個最正確的實踐。我們不必疑慮，我們只有熱情地信剌而表現在我們的行動。</p>
<p>然而我們應當嚴厲的指出某些奸細們者，他們首先對於這次五中全會的議决案，最重要而最可疑慮的一件就是國防最高委員的設立，他們此種疑慮，其實就是×人的疑慮。</p>
<p>奸細們，眼中的國防碗高委員會，是有意歪曲着視綫，有意抹煞着眞正的事實的。他們死口咬定最高國防委員會，乃是國共兩黨共同委員會的建立，他們否定了各抗日黨派的並存與合作的重要因索這是一種對各抗日黨派的汚衊，一種最陰毒的挑撥伎倆，我們該要淸楚的看出他們的面目罷。</p>
<p>奸細們一路來都是造出共產黨刦　政府的謠言。他們這造謠確有相當的本領，但人民大衆以及精明的抗戰將士都用信着事實，而粉碎了奴方們造謠的嘴舌。所以自五中全會明會後。一直到國防最高委員會設立的目前，奴才們雖然也還是同樣的造出共產黨刦待國防委員會的謠言，而堅决反對這個容納各抗日黨派的最高權力機關，可是人們已經深明了這不過是奴才們心勞日出的狂吠，沒有人聽它，更沒有人信它的。信它的人，恐怕只有少數民族收類與擺出奴隸總管的架子的　落文人罷。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要鄭重的說一句，國防最高委員會，乃是各抗日黨派的眞正合作，民埃統一陣綫的眞正建立的最高母體，這當然　奸細眼中所看不到的了，因為妤細是染有昏盲眼病的；我們常前的任務，是在思樣戮穿這些民族扒手們的惡毒謠言，而把亞們的罪惡，赤裸裸的暴露在民衆前面。</p>

<p>每次製片商請求准許攝製他的作品時，蕭伯納總是冷笑地說：『我是够出名了，不需要任何影片來增加我的光榮。我是够富足了，不需要　們的錢。所以我為什麼要把我的作品賣給　片商呢？他們也許會糟塌它們，給我不必要的煩惱』！</p>
<p>一個一個製片商都這樣碰壁，不想再在他身上打什麽主意。這個特橡，後來却讓一個比較不出名的製片商獲得，一切有名的公司反而失敗。葛白利。巴斯葛，雖然！是一個法國人的名字，他是生在匈牙利的。他是一個　聞計者，說明書撰述人，小說家及製片人，他甲在好萊塢，倫敦，柏林，維也納，羅馬布建佩斯許多製片公司工作不少時間。</p>
<p>最近他在巴黎，囊中不名一分，他忽發奇想，寫了一封信給兩三年前曾在亞得里亞海　見過一面的蕭伯納求助，他那封信的大意是：</p>
<p>『先生，也許你仍　記得我，我們在意人利，曾經叙談過』次『實際上叙談過十五分鐘』，也許你還記得，我現在是一個製斤商，我老是對于你的著作感覺興趣　，我極希望把你者的一個劇本，尤其是『Pygmalfon』　，製成影片，在什麽條件之下，你賜給我這個特權呢？至少，你隨便給我一種吧。</p>
<p>眞奇怪，蕭伯納眞還記得這個匈牙利人，並且一反平時的習慣，還給了他一封囘信，這一次他不像先前一樣，老是說些令人失望的話，他指示他（巴斯萬）去找他的帳房先生，『這是　頂講理的人，他現在荷蘭旅行，他告訴他（帳房先生）在路特頓的通信處。</p>
<p>『我唯一的機會是我自己到路特頓去！』巴斯葛對他在巴黎的唯一的朋友說，並且把蕭伯納的回信給他看。『如果你能够借一千法郎給我，我在一星期內可以取得Pygmalion「的攝製檢」。</p>
<p>那個朋友，借了一千法郎給他，巴斯葛就跑到路特頓夫會那個帳房先生（他是倫敦的一個律帥）。經過了十次的談判，他們還沒有商議定當。巴斯　怎麽辦呢？那位律師索價極大，要　期付欵，並且要求一切保證，而巴斯島口袋裏的錢，却一天一天少起來。最後他的錢全部用完，沿着路特頓船塢散步，他無意十看見一隻英國運貨船在一小時以內開到倫教去。</p>
<p>『船長在那裏』？巴斯葛擊機一動的問。</p>
<p>『你問重作什麽？』在他面　的一個水于囘答說。『他大概在大路那邊的酒館裏？』</p>
<p>『船長』，那個匈牙利人請求那位高　，的豪爽的人說『只有你可以救我的性命。我水遠感激你。』</p>
<p>巴斯嘆極簡單的把他現在的處境告訴他他接得蕭伯納的回信，他與蕭伯納的帳房的商講不得要領。</p>
<p>『如果你會我到倫敦去，我一定能够會見蕭伯納，只要見到他，一切問題在牛小時以內可以全部解决』。</p>
<p>三十小時以後，巴斯噶到逢倫敦，到輪伯納家中。</p>
<p>『我是葛白利，巴斯　』，他說。『我到遼夢來，請你自己簽定這張合同，因為你的帳房先生，雖然極會做生意，但是我和他總說不投機。你想，他把我們的談判拉長到十天以上，弄到我口袋裏一個便十都拿不出來。事實上，現在我是請一隻運貨船的船長帶我到倫敦來看你的。』</p>
<p>蕭伯納聽了這些話，不覺哈哈六笑。兩個人接着談了一囘，喝了一兩杯威士忌酒。兩伯納就在哈巴斯葛那封信的信　後面，簽定了『Pygmanon』的攝製　給他。</p>
<p>這部影片正任倫敦攝製，一個新片商向將成功的路上前進。『譯自MagazineDfgest』</p>

<p>廣東青年抗日先鋒隊</p>
<p>（一）踏上二千八百里的征途</p>
<p>是深秋時節了，秋風飄颯着，格桐柴從母體裏零落地洒下。廣州芳村培英學校的大廣場裏，擠着幾百沸着血的靑年，緊張，熱烈的空氣，漲滿本來相當荒落的大廣塲，這是整個抗允的同志聚集着的大會，在這兒，討論着出發的行軍路綫和編隊。</p>
<p>十月邪惡日晚，七十多個不同服裝的戰土，背上包袱，沉着，迅速，蛇般穿過廣州的　街，涉過河。到了石圍塘軍站，開始踏上我們一千八百里的征途。</p>
<p>午夜了，天體像墨般黑，只有疏疏的幾點星星眨着眼。石圍塘車站，擠着無數　的難民，忽然，嗚嗚的警報，電燈熄滅了，一切都停止了活動，我們只得散開在車站的週國。天將要　時，才解除警報，大隊沿着鐵路摸索着前進，天光後，炸彈爆裂聲像跟在　後，回頭望去，遠遠的白雲山下，在不停地冒着白烟，毀滅了，廣州毀滅了，一種難以抑壓的沉重壓上心頭，大家懷着悲憤的心情，依然繼續前進。</p>
<p>佛山，同樣是緊張，混亂，老百姓忙着疏散。經過一日夜的步行，疲之侵襲在每個同志的身上，大家倒頭便睡着。半夜，人正睡得甜，奈何集合的哨子響了，帶着惺忪而模糊的姿態歸隊，隊長響着沙啞的聲音說：『同志們—大家都促疲乏了，可是，這點點兒苦，抗先的同忘是不在乎的，我們為了國家，為了民族，我們應該吃盡一切的苦，抗先的同志是不怕辛苦的，大家拿出先　精神來，這些話，一句句打在同志們的耳鼓裏，像注上一口嗎啡，同時，隊長佈告看，我們是急行軍，在夜裏特別應該加强警楊性。</p>
<p>從西南，到琶江口，走水路，經過多方的交涉，才找得一條帆船，擠術七十多個人，還有原來的搭客，所以。無論船的那一個角落，船傍，船頂，都擠滿了人。船呟得太飽了，走得像駱駝般滯緩，我們為了要急進，為要了減輕船家的辛勞，就發動了拉蕯隊，無疑地，每個同志都充分地表示着先鋒精神的，請纓的踴躍爭先，於是分了組，輪流　帮船家拉纜。唱着船夫曲，却用着與　活潑的姿態，急速的把船拖着走；因此，我們能够很快地溜過西南，三水，藍苞，淸遠，而至琶江口。</p>
<p>琶江口的鐵牌，只剩下幾根歪成，無力而又殘廢地支持着。橋下不斷地，流着燒焦的木塊，為了阻止敵人的前進，我方是不惜犧牲了多少偉人的建築物啦。據情報，×人離此只不過七八十里，我們估計過×人的進攻路線，决定　過這危險線，取道向北走。</p>
<p>學習，學習，再學習，這是隊裏自我敎育的中心口號，水路上，沒有什麽工作，時間就丟在理論的學習上，爭取時間，讀必要讀的書，熱烈地討論着有關抗戰的各種問題。</p>
<p>從邑江口起，大隊是沿着粵鉄路前進，沿途的車站都燒燬了，車站傍疊着一堆堆的枕木，在能熊的總着，這是我方為了不甘資　用的表示，一切都為了×人燒壞了，何時正得收拾破山河，這只要我們肯努力！</p>
<p>雖然是急行軍，然而，沒有一刻把我們的工作放　過。大坑口的一個小山岡，樹林像帳幕般給它蓋得密之地，我們駐在這兒，碰到廿九軍新招的一隊弟兄，這隊本來頺颯，而充滿了思家的情緒的新入伍者，給我們什歡送大會裏的演講，歐聲，趨走了豐迫蕭他們的疲乏，和組構着他們的思家心情，尤其是隊裏的小鬼，更使他們趕到上前綫去和×人拚命，是光榮的義務和神聖的權利啊！</p>
<p>小鬼時只有十三歲的一個女同志，她跟着哥哥參加抗先，背上包袱；插在大隊裏，同樣地踏着大步跟着大隊走。走山路找不到人家，跑六七十里吃不到一頓經飯，然而，却不能減煞她的與奮，不但用不到大鬼的繁忙，而且，還常常起着使大鬼們興齊的動力。</p>
<p>（二）打到×人後方去</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Japanese Warlords' Deception and Its Consequences <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Warlords, both ancient and modern, Eastern and Western, are intoxicated with power and do not believe in justice or true feelings in the world. They believe that only military force can achieve anything and that many deceptions can rule over foreign races. The defeat of Napoleon and the failure of Wilhelm II were not enough to awaken them. On the contrary, they claimed that their predecessors were not clever enough. Therefore, although Wilhelm failed, Hitler still copied his old tricks, and although Tanaka failed, Itagaki remained unchanged. Because Hitler and Itagaki believed that their predecessors' unwisdom lay in neglecting political work, especially propaganda work. In the minds of Hitler and Itagaki, propaganda was deception. They believed that designing several deceptions could lead to success. But what are the consequences of deception? Let's start with a description of Itagaki's deceptions over the years:</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords' propaganda principles for deceiving the Chinese people were "no territorial ambitions" and "aid to China's independence," "Sino-Japanese cooperation," and "anti-communism to save the country." The facts of these deceptions unfolding before us are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The so-called "Great Hanism" was brought to Xiamen by the traitor Zhang Ming in May last year. The reason given by the Japanese warlords for promoting "Great Hanism" in Xiamen was said to be the result of accepting the suggestion of the traitor Zhang Ming. Because nationalist ideas in South China were deeply rooted, and the Three People's Principles could not be adopted, a nationalist facade was needed to attract young people and overseas Chinese. The Japanese warlords thought this was a reasonable suggestion, so they readily accepted it, and at the same time clarified that the purpose of Great Hanism was the autonomy of the Han people, which could also prove that the Japanese warlords had no territorial ambitions in Xiamen. Zhang Ming began to promote "Great Hanism" for less than a month, and the Taiwan government issued a serious protest, saying that Taiwan had five million Han people, and if "Great Hanism" became popular in Taiwan and a revolution broke out, who would be responsible? What followed was a demand that Xiamen be governed by the Taiwan government. After five months of dispute, the ruling power of Xiamen fell into the hands of the Taiwan government, and "Great Hanism" followed Zhang Ming to Shanghai to live a life of leisure. The lesson of "Great Hanism" is deception, eternal deception!</p>
<p>(2) The "Peaceful Salvation of the Country" movement was also a deception that the Japanese warlords were proud of. The director of this deception was Doihara, the executors in North China were Kita, in Central China was Kusumoto, and in South China were Kayano and Takahashi. The slogan was peace and saving the country, but the real intention was to divide the united front and disintegrate the Kuomintang. This conspiracy began after the fall of Xuzhou. Groups claiming to save the country issued false telegrams and statements, spread rumors and slandered generals as being pro-Japanese, and spread an atmosphere of peace. All the tricks of deception were put on stage, but the result after half a year was Wang Jingwei's escape and the censorship of the ×× Daily. All the deceptions were exposed.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Itagaki said, "Wang Jingwei misunderstood our true intentions. We expected Wang to play a role within Chongqing, but now he has left."</p>
<p>(3) "Anti-communist and pro-Japanese government" is the smokescreen used by the Japanese warlords to cover up "no territorial ambitions" and "aid to China's independence." Therefore, Doihara desperately tried to get Tang Shaoyi to come out of retirement. After Tang's death, he desperately tried to get Wu Peifu to serve as the puppet president, in order to deceive the international community and manipulate the backward masses. Using the means of enticement, threats, and rumors, he tried to force Wu Peifu to become a traitor. However, Wu Peifu put forward two conditions: one was that political power should be returned to the Chinese people, and the other was that an army commanded by the Chinese should be organized. Since they claimed to have no territorial ambitions and wanted to aid China's independence, Wu Peifu's conditions should of course be acceptable. Why couldn't they agree and instead tear down their own deception? Foreign Minister Arita, in his speech to the Diet on December 22, declared that "the Imperial government hopes that the new central government will be established as soon as possible to cooperate with us in resolving the war situation." Only eight days later, when answering questions from members of the Diet, he reversed his previous statement and said, "From a historical and current perspective, it is not easy to create a central government with China as a whole. It is only necessary to unite local regimes to deal with international affairs." This was an action of slapping oneself in the face. Deception is just deception, and lies cannot produce the truth, which was to be expected.</p>
<p>Now the Japanese warlords' policy of inducing surrender has failed, and the deception has also failed. The international crisis is pressing on the doorstep of the three islands. In order to break the deadlock, the political parties have suggested convening a Sino-Japanese ethnic conference to find a way to resolve the dispute. The veteran ministers are also planning to convene an international conference to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Hiranuma did not accept this suggestion at first, but the domestic crisis has reached the most profound stage, and the crisis of international intervention has also become a possibility due to the United States joining the camp. This is indeed an urgency that the warlords did not expect. Therefore, Hiranuma's attitude has gradually inclined towards acceptance, but the warlords are still obsessed and are planning new deceptions, hoping to gain advantages in the deceptions!</p>
<p>Regardless of how the Japanese political situation changes and how the Japanese warlords come up with new tricks, deception is always deception and can never solve the Sino-Japanese dispute. We should raise our political vigilance, step up political work in the war zones, and advance alongside the military, using our strength to shatter the Japanese warlords' illusions—to make the Japanese warlords know the power of justice!</p>

<h3 id="e2">The New World War (II) <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youren</p>
<p>In fact, today in Asia, Europe, and Africa, there is already a state of actual war of "undeclared war." This state can suddenly appear at any time, as long as you can see those new "Caesars" who seem to be in Austria, in Czechoslovakia, in Spain, in the Mediterranean, in North Africa and Palestine, in Abyssinia, in China, and in the planned and actual actions on the seas of the Far East. And you can see that these types of actions are about to expand to other regions: to those regions that Italy believes the London Treaty promised to cede but has not yet ceded to him, to Egypt, to the colonies of England, France, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands, and to Asia, to other regions of the Pacific. If the activities of Germany and Italy continue to be carried out in Nicaragua and elsewhere in the Americas, then the expansion of actions will also reach important strongholds within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine.</p>
<p>(IV) War and Diplomacy</p>
<p>These types of actions have various forms. When dealing with a weak country that has not entered into a military agreement with another strong country, such as China, Abyssinia, and Spain, these types of actions are manifested in the form of open warfare. If it is to deal with a weak country that also has a military agreement with England and France, then the manifestation of the action must take other forms. And if it is to deal with the powerful England and France, knowing that England and France, with the aid of Soviet Russia, can subdue today's "Caesars," then the manifestation of the action should take other forms. In short, when dealing with strong countries and weak countries that have military agreements with strong countries, today's "Caesars" will naturally use their totalitarian diplomatic methods and means from many aspects to use their new strategy of "invisible warfare." In diplomatic use, they are different from England and France. England and France regard diplomacy as a gamble, a skill. Hitler and Mussolini regard diplomacy as a department in war.</p>
<p>Then, can the actions of tangible and intangible wars that are occurring simultaneously in various places today be regarded as accidental events? Here we can also ask whether the battlefields of the previous World War were also accidental local wars?</p>
<p>In today's tangible and intangible wars, there is indeed a common effect. The actions of today's tangible and intangible wars are really no different from the wars in the various battlefields of the previous World War. In the previous World War, the war in France that converged the Western battlefields with the war in northern France became the European War from 1914 to 1917. After the United States joined the war, this European war changed into a World War. Today, the tangible war launched by Japan in China on September 18, the tangible war launched by Italy in Abyssinia in 1935, the tangible war launched by Germany and Italy in Spain in 1936, and the intangible wars launched by Germany and Italy in various parts of Europe, in the Mediterranean, in North Africa, and in Palestine, have become a "convergence of great wars." This "convergence of great wars" has now become a new World War due to the emergence of the Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>(V) Dictators and the Scourge of War</p>
<p>And it is really not easy to realize that the so-called "next World War" has already occurred. Because the arrival of this great war is like the coming of death mentioned in the Christian Bible, sneaking in like a petty thief in the middle of the night!</p>
<p>The beginning of the previous World War was completely based on the rituals prescribed by international law, beginning with a formal declaration of war, followed by rapid military mobilization, and then by mass killings. And many people still deeply believe that the opening of the "next World War" must go through the same rituals and must first see the same ominous signs. But this war, this war that today's dictatorial leaders have long begun, will naturally have extremely painful and massive killings when it enters the second stage of determining victory or defeat, when it enters the stage when totalitarian countries begin their general offensive. And this new great war not only has no need for a formal declaration of war, but also has no need for a sudden mobilization, because in totalitarian countries under dictators, the army has long been permanently mobilized.</p>
<p>Just like ancient Rome, it implemented a dictatorship during wartime in order to lead the war more effectively. Today's Germany and Italy obviously have a great leader and a fighting leader. They have long actually and openly ruled their countries with the spirit and means of complete dictators. They have used their power and totalitarian methods to mobilize the national male, material, and spiritual forces, and have transformed their countries into the highest degree of fighting nations. In wartime, even a democratic country must take such measures. Even the democratic countries during the previous World War had roughly implemented this means of concentrating power. Democratic countries are like this, then these dictators who believe that they can only achieve their goals by means of war naturally need to maximize the use of their national totalitarian organizations and functions in order to achieve the establishment of the Great German Third Reich desired in the book "Mein Kampf," Mussolini's New Roman Empire, and the expanded Japanese Empire established by the Japanese young and middle-aged dictators who desire to establish a "New Order in East Asia."</p>
<h3 id="e3">See How the Japanese Will Invade Guangxi <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter dispatched by this newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>The withdrawal from Wuhan occurred three months ago. The stalemate and silent war situation has recently shown signs of becoming gradually tense again. The main reason for this is that the exhausted Japanese, desperate for food, hastily assembled old, weak, young, and puppet Mongolian troops, making some supplements and reorganizations, and not forgetting the dream of a quick decision (?), they want to make one last struggle. Moreover, since the former Japanese prime minister made a ridiculous statement about peace negotiations, it has not only failed to sell their conspiracy of political division to us, but has instead shaken the wavering elements lurking within us, making the unity of the whole country more consolidated. At the same time, international forces aiding China have also entered a new stage along with our resistance, becoming increasingly active, and have extended credit and loans to us one after another. Seeing that our great cause of resisting the war and building the country is about to be completed quickly and smoothly—this, in the eyes of the Japanese fascist warlords, is of course the most serious blow to their policy of aggression! At this critical moment, if the Japanese warlords can immediately lay down their butcher knives and retreat in the face of difficulties, their national life may not be ruined from then on. But the Japanese warlords, who believe that "every Japanese is a Napoleon," are absolutely unwilling to do so. This is like an old buffalo entering a narrow alley; it can't turn around and has to go all the way, blindly. From this, we know that since their political conspiracy against us has failed, they will continue to make a last-ditch effort militarily.</p>
<p>To make a last-ditch effort militarily, they want to swallow our entire Chinese nation in one bite. How easy is that? To speak frankly, in the first phase of the War of Resistance, we fought with our bodies and machines, desperately fighting flesh and blood against artillery fire. We certainly encountered some unexpected failures. Now that our War of Resistance has reached the second phase, the quality of our troops has improved, the number has increased, and mechanized units have been added. The various military, political, economic, and other departmental agencies have also undergone strong and dense improvements to meet the needs of wartime. Whether in the Northwest, Central, and Southwest battlefields, as well as in the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines, all necessary preparations have been doubled. No matter which direction the Japanese focus on attacking us, or whether they attack on all three fronts, north, south, and central, we can give them extremely strong blows and crush any of their offensive strategies.</p>
<p>What's more, after the launch of the second phase of the War of Resistance, if the Japanese, due to troop limitations, adopt a strategy of defending the north and attacking the south, or defending the south and attacking the center, then our response method, based on the initiative we have already gained in the early stage, will be to implement a comprehensive war of resistance in this phase. We must not only go all out to fight head-on against the road of the Japanese main force's invasion, but also treat the aspects where the Japanese have adopted a defensive posture "equally," launching large-scale attacks to drive them out and reclaim our rivers and mountains. Therefore, the places where the flames of war burn are not only in one war zone where the Japanese main force is invading, but in all war zones in the south, center, and behind enemy lines. The battlefield is larger than in the early stage of the War of Resistance, and the war is also more intense than in the early stage, and the journey to our "final victory" is naturally shorter and closer.</p>
<p>To put it more concretely, in the future war situation, we will learn from the bloody lessons learned in the previous stage and strictly prevent the Japanese from using fewer troops to calmly transfer them on various battlefields and defeat us individually. Then we will adopt the strategy of "responding to the north when attacking the south, responding to the south when attacking the north, and responding to both north and south when attacking the center," advancing step by step and setting up positions everywhere. Instead of waiting for them to attack me, I will attack them first, and I will surely make them unable to resist and be trapped and defeated by the surrounding Chu songs.</p>
<p>The above is the reporter's rough view of the war situation in the second phase. Therefore, after the sound of New Year's firecrackers, I was just about to head north from Hengyang when I met a colleague on the street who had just come from the northern Guangdong battlefield. He said: The Japanese are retreating from the northern Guangdong battlefield and concentrating in Guangzhou, preparing to join forces with the Japanese fleet in Beihai to prepare to invade Guangxi. Therefore, the center of gravity of the war in the second phase must be in Guangxi. He also persuaded me to return to Guangxi and work together. But after I told him the reason that Guangxi will be tight, and the central and northwest will inevitably have a big battle, he also nodded very much.</p>
<p>However, the flames of war have spread to the border between Guangdong and Guangxi. What kind of changes will there be in the situation? This is indeed a question that deserves great attention. In order to get a reliable answer to this question, I specially visited Mr. Xie Zongkeng, the director of the Eighth Route Army's office in Hengyang. Mr. Xie is from Guangxi and has held important positions in the province's military and political circles, so he is very familiar with the people of Guangxi. According to him: "Guangxi is a major base for our resistance in the southwest. It is expected that the Japanese will invade sooner or later. Perhaps the purpose of invading Guangxi is only to 'attack the east and strike the west,' to contain our southwest forces in order to cover up their activities in the northwest. Judging from their invasion routes into Guangxi, there are no more than three: one is to go up the Xijiang River, one is to land at Beihai, and the other is to enter Guangxi from Sihui, Guangdong, along the highway through Guangning and other counties, to Huaining to threaten Guilin. However, Guangxi is mostly mountainous, with natural hazards. Since wars have occurred, it has always been difficult to attack and easy to defend. If the Japanese can use shallow-water ships to invade on the Xijiang River with all their strength, they will at most be able to reach Wuzhou. Above Wuzhou, the waterways are shallow and have many beaches, making it extremely difficult to navigate. The roads are branched and there are no bridges across the river. Even if the Japanese increase their troops threefold, they will not be able to advance an inch. If they attempt to land in Beihai, the shallow beaches along the coast are more than twenty miles wide, and light and heavy troops cannot get close to the shore. The coastal defense line is as solid as gold. The Japanese can only use motorboats and artillery to harass, and it is difficult to shake the hair of our defense line. As for the highway into Guangxi from Sihui, there are even more steep mountains and winding roads that are difficult to describe. The terrain along the road is not suitable for the activities of mechanized units. When necessary, we can quickly destroy the entire road. Guangxi's natural environment is fully equipped with superior national defense conditions, and we also have strong personnel preparations. We have already deployed each entrance to the dangerous places into heavenly trenches—'arranging fragrant cakes to fish for golden turtles,' see how you, the Japanese, invade"?</p>
<p>Mr. Xie's remarks are like an experienced official judging a case. There is not a single word or sentence that is not based on the actual situation. The land in North China is flat and the transportation is convenient. The Japanese are still "able to get on their horses immediately" but unable to govern from horseback. Now, in Guangxi, which has all three advantages of favorable weather, geographical advantages, and the support of the people, they are attempting to invade with great fanfare. This is too much for them to overestimate themselves. Although, the ancients said it well: "If Qingfu does not die, the disaster of Lu will not end." The Japanese fascist warlords' predatory careers and war ambitions will not fail until they reach the end of the road, and she will hope to turn around. Come on; we, the heroic soldiers of China, who bear the heavy responsibility of defending Guangxi, have taken off the gun covers and wiped off the bayonets, and have been waiting for a long time!</p>

The Japanese Attempt to Invade Shaanxi Becomes a Bubble. <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Xi'an, 5th of the month by this newspaper] Although the plan to invade the Northwest is urgent, the Yellow River has rapid water flow and the ice shuttles are small pieces. Currently spring is approaching, it will not freeze solid, and our river defenses have been strengthened, the Japanese attempt to cross the river to invade Shaanxi will be a bubble. The Japanese are accumulating food and ammunition in Ningwu, Shanxi province, as a base for invading the Northwest. The Japanese in Eastern Jin, HeShun, Liaoxian, have increased to two brigades and continued to divide and attack west. They fought fiercely with us in Ximucheng. There were also battles near Liaoxian and Sixiacun. Liaoxian has been overcome by us. After the Japanese invaded Yicheng in Quwo, they have a tendency to continue east. We have taken strict precautions. There is still the sound of artillery fire on the banks of the Yellow River in Southwestern Jin. Approximately 1300 Japanese soldiers at Zhan Dian Station and Xiao Ji Dian Station in Northern Henan, in our surprise attack. Approximately 4000 Japanese soldiers in Xiuwu are moving northwest and were intercepted by us, with over 100 Japanese soldiers killed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 5th of the month] Liaoxian, which was once captured by the Japanese on the 31st of last month, has been retaken by us on the 2nd after we increased and redeployed troops. Currently our army is dividing and pursuing. It will not be difficult to eliminate the Japanese invaders in Eastern Jin.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Fierce Battles on Various Roads in Guangdong. The Japanese Continue to Increase Troops in Sanshui. <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Special report from Sihui, 5th of the month by this newspaper] The various roads in Guangdong are still in fierce battles. Over 300 Japanese soldiers invaded and harassed Lianzu from Zengcheng to Dongguan and were killed by us. Over 500 Japanese soldiers in Xinjie invaded and harassed Maxi Huangqi Mountain. The Japanese in Fengyong fled into Jinbu. We intercepted and attacked them. The Japanese in Sanshui have increased to three companies. The Japanese continued to open from Diankewan to the south, and cut off traffic on the Beihai sea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 4th of the month] Our guerrillas ambushed the Japanese in two ways between Tongshan Chongyang on the evening of the 3rd, and gave the Japanese a heavy blow. Often, one route detected that over a hundred Japanese soldiers in Baini Bridge were moving towards Chongyang along the highway. Our army ambushed Gaojia Ling on the east side of the road, and waited for the Japanese to pass. Taking advantage of the superior terrain from a high position, they launched dense shooting, killing over dozens of Japanese soldiers and seizing a lot of ammunition. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated in panic to Baiqiao. Another route detected that about one or two miles south of Nanlin Bridge, in Tongpen Ridge, there was a Japanese company entrenched and fortifications were built. They groped forward in the dark of night, and set fire to the barracks before the Japanese soldiers, and then destroyed the barbed wire set up around their quarters. The Japanese soldiers fled in a hurry. They were captured by us in large numbers. Later, the Japanese soldiers in Nanlin Bridge opened fire to support, and some of them fled towards Nanlin Bridge.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Smooth Cargo Transport Between Burma and Yunnan: British and Burmese Authorities Take Strict Protective Measures; ×'s Conspiracy to Disrupt Thwarted <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Since the disruption of the Canton-Hankow Railway, our sea gateway route has shifted from Hong Kong-Canton-Hankow to Burma-Yunnan. Rangoon has imperceptibly become a second transfer hub. Our overseas purchases of European and American goods are now entirely shipped directly to Burma, then transported back to Kunming via the Burma-Yunnan land and water transport routes, before being distributed to various locations in need. For more than three months, the goods we have ordered from Europe and America that are transported by waterway have consistently used the Suez Canal route, and the large quantities of goods previously stored in Hong Kong have also been gradually transferred via Rangoon. Having been completed, a certain official dispatched by the central government to Rangoon to manage the transfer of goods came to Hong Kong on official business. Upon inquiring about the transport situation in Burma and Yunnan, and the conditions in Burma, he described the following:</p>
<p>Pro-China and Pro-× Locals Form Two Factions</p>
<p>The Burmese people's level of knowledge is relatively low, leading to the imperceptible formation of two major factions among the Burmese locals: pro-China and pro-×. The situation has become increasingly tense recently. Burmese people traditionally deeply believe in Buddhism and have great faith in their monk leaders. Among them, a monk leader named 某 [omitted] has always engaged in local autonomy movements and incited the locals to engage in various disruptive actions. He had been imprisoned several times before. Later, unable to gain a foothold, he fled to Tokyo, Japan, where he was taken in and exploited by the × [omitted]. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the × [omitted] sent Mr. Ke back to Burma to conduct pro-× propaganda among the locals. A portion of the simple-minded locals were quite fooled by him. However, the majority of Burmese people have great sympathy for us. Since the beginning of the war, they have adopted a pro-China and anti-× attitude. Most of the people on this side are intellectuals, led by high-ranking officials in the Burmese government, who lead the entire Burmese education sector and the working class of merchants in actively supporting China and enthusiastically promoting various practical actions. They are highly admired by both Chinese and foreign figures and actively resist Mr. Ke and his followers, who are incited and lured by the × [omitted]. They are particularly powerful in terms of written propaganda.</p>
<p>After the Burma-Yunnan Road became our main foreign route, the monk-led pro-× locals urgently tried to disrupt it and did their best to obstruct the transport of goods to our country through Burma. Disruptions to the Burma-Yunnan transport line have occurred repeatedly in the three months since. On the one hand, they searched for various military raw materials. A month ago, the × [omitted] attempted to bribe a local to purchase a large amount of kerosene from a certain kerosene company at the Burmese oil fields for transport to Japan. However, the person in charge of the company suspected that the locals were buying a large amount of kerosene and investigated strictly, revealing the truth and refusing to sell. This aroused jealousy among the × [omitted]. Later, after a great deal of suppression and mediation by the authorities, a satisfactory resolution was reached.</p>
<p>British and Burmese Authorities Carefully Maintain Public Order</p>
<p>After the inside story was revealed, the British and Burmese authorities, in order to maintain overall public security, promulgated emergency martial law regulations for extraordinary times, taking careful measures in important areas such as traffic throughout Burma. In the past, the Burmese-Chinese transportation industry was extremely chaotic, with all kinds of vehicles operating freely by merchants and without time restrictions. However, due to the current tense situation, these have been curbed and uniformly managed. Following the Hong Kong traffic management methods, whether it is long-distance buses, taxis, trams, etc., they must all be registered with the government and operated exclusively by one company. Furthermore, all traffic and vehicle operations are restricted from ceasing after 5 PM every day. The main traffic routes are patrolled by an increased number of police officers, and the British defense forces stationed in Burma have also been ordered to assist the police in defending local security and maintaining order. Under these strong measures, public order has improved. At the same time, for thorough planning, all social norms have been placed under emergency regulations for extraordinary times. Regardless of any person, any gathering cannot be freely held without the permission of the authorities. Machine gun and artillery fortifications have been set up in various important Burmese city markets, commercial districts, and road junctions, and they are garrisoned by British defense forces. Every night, the atmosphere is tense and heavily guarded.</p>
<p>Troops Stationed Along Transportation Lines</p>
<p>Since our imports of goods ordered from Europe and America are now transported via the Burma-Yunnan line, the urgency of shipping has created a phenomenon rarely seen in Burmese history. Cargo ships from various countries shuttle back and forth in the waters of Rangoon, and large cargo ships traveling to and from Burma and Yunnan on the Irrawaddy River are operating day and night. Because the main Burmese-Chinese transport line, the railway, is not yet fully completed, all goods are transferred by road freight trucks. If heavy machinery is encountered, they are forced to be transferred by waterway because bridges and other structures are unable to handle the load. Therefore, the number of river ships has temporarily increased dozens of times due to the current special needs. The British and Burmese authorities, in order to carefully protect the safety of our transferred goods, prohibit all irrelevant persons from approaching our purchased goods upon arrival in inland waterways, whether they are on the original ship or have been transferred to barges. Even any ships must be moored at a distance of one hundred feet away, or they will be severely punished. As for the section of the Burma-Yunnan Highway within Burmese territory, a protective station is established at regular intervals, garrisoned by British defense forces and equipped with powerful anti-aircraft guns and machine guns for comprehensive protection. The Burma Road runs from Rangoon directly to the Hsenwi station on the Burmese-Yunnan border, a distance of 655 miles. On the 512-mile journey, there is the Gokteik Viaduct, a great engineering feat of the world. The bridge is one and a half miles long and is constructed between two mountain ridges. The distance from the bridge surface to the bottom of the valley is over seven thousand feet. This shows the immensity of the bridge's construction. Currently, anti-aircraft defense stations have been set up at both ends of the bridge and in the middle, defended by the military. Pedestrians are strictly prohibited from passing, and vehicles passing over the bridge are also prohibited unless they have obtained a permit from the Chinese and British authorities. Each military convoy must first be led by an armored vehicle before proceeding, followed by a string of cargo trucks.</p>
<p>Burma-Yunnan Railway to Be Completed Soon</p>
<p>The frequency of cargo transport on the Burma-Yunnan line is increasing daily, and it is believed that this transportation route will undoubtedly develop further in the future. To meet future needs, both China and Britain have already started construction on the Burma-Yunnan Railway. Currently, the railway project is being accelerated for completion, and it is estimated that the administrative methods of the railway will be based on the British-Chinese collaboration methods of the Canton-Kowloon Railway around May or June of this year. The reporter also learned that upon the completion of the Burma-Yunnan Railway, all personnel originally employed on the Canton-Kowloon and Canton-Hankow Railways will be transferred to serve on that railway to gain experience. Mr. Li Lüzhuan, the former director of the Canton-Kowloon Railway Bureau, has also left Hong Kong for Rangoon to plan and allocate personnel for the entire railway, so that they can quickly become operational at that time, increasing our import of overseas goods, thereby strengthening all aspects of the war effort and national reconstruction.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Assault on British Nationals in Hankou: British Consulate Lodges Protest; Situation in Hankou Shows No Improvement After × Ceases Blockade of French Concession <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] News from Hankou: Regarding the assault on British national Mr. Corson and his wife by Japanese sentries on January 27th, the British consul in Hankou has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities. Mr. Corson is the manager of the Hankou Trading Company and the Hankou Ice Factory. According to his wife, they saw a Chinese worker attempting to carry a basket of food into the French Concession that day. Japanese sentries immediately destroyed the food and dishes in the basket. Mr. Corson and his wife did not interfere, but the Japanese sentries surrounded them and attempted to push them into a Japanese naval vehicle. Mr. and Mrs. Corson resisted, and the Japanese sentries began to beat them and strip their clothes. French police rescued Mr. and Mrs. Corson. Mrs. Corson was bedridden for several days due to the assault.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] News from Hankou: The Japanese authorities ceased their "blockade" of the French Concession yesterday. Chinese people can now carry a small amount of food into the French Concession. However, if the Japanese side deems that too much is being carried, the food will still be confiscated. Today, many Chinese people are therefore entering the French Concession.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] News from Hankou: On February 2nd, the Japanese consulate here issued a notice stating that foreign nationals in Hankou must henceforth show proof of identity when passing Japanese sentry posts for inspection. The Japanese military authorities explained this to reporters yesterday, stating that Hankou is still under martial law. Although no incidents have occurred to date, there is no guarantee that incidents will not occur in the future. Therefore, the Japanese side cannot treat third-country nationals differently. Foreign nationals do not need to remove their hats and salute Japanese sentries when passing sentry posts.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] News from Tianjin: Since × forces occupied Tianjin, they have arbitrarily arrested and oppressed our people, employing every possible means. Recently, × forces set up obstacles near the British and French concessions, threatening to blockade the two concessions. They sent personnel to major stores in the concessions to negotiate, demanding 300,000 yuan in "contribution" funds as a condition for removing the obstacles and stopping the inspection of pedestrians. However, our fellow merchants have refused.</p>

<p>— Meng</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming] Kunming is located in the southwest corner. In the past, due to poor communication and economic difficulties, culture could not be cultivated. Therefore, before the War of Resistance, it was a culturally underdeveloped place. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, everything in Kunming has become active in the past year. In terms of culture, Kunming has added two newspapers, relocated five national universities, attracted many cultural figures, increased several theater troupes, and newly published many magazines.</p>
<p>(1) Newspapers</p>
<p>Kunming originally had two newspapers, the "Yunnan Daily" and the "Republic Daily." The former has a long history and good sales locally. The latter is the party newspaper of the Yunnan Provincial Party Headquarters and is located within the Party Headquarters. Both newspapers have undergone significant improvements recently after being exposed to new culture.</p>
<p>The newspapers that have recently arrived in Kunming are the Tianjin Yishibao and the Nanjing Chao Bao. The Yishibao resumed publication in Kunming on December 8th last year. Although it has only been a little over a month, its sales are particularly good. This is partly because their work is intense, and they have added several young reporters studying at universities, making them appear unusually active. On the other hand, their supplements are particularly numerous: "Religion and Culture," "Youth Garden," "Surrounded by Flames of War," "Reading," "Books," "Education," "History," "Medicine," and "Borderland," "Science." The first three are edited by the newspaper and have been well-received by a wide readership since their publication.</p>
<p>Recently, the Yishibao has also published a small "Yishibao Evening News." Kunming has seen an evening newspaper for the first time, so it is particularly welcomed by the general public.</p>
<p>The Chao Bao resumed publication in early December last year. It is a concise small newspaper with an affordable price. It is published very early in the morning, so it is also very popular with the general public.</p>
<p>The "Central Daily News" Changsha Edition will also be republished in Kunming in the future. Their equipment and entire staff have already departed from Guilin and will arrive in Kunming soon. At the same time, the Chongqing Shishi Xinbao will also set up a branch in Kunming.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Chen Youren Condemns Hitler's Absurd Speech: Suggests Diplomatic Authorities Promptly Lodge Protest <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report] In his speech to the Reichstag last week, German leader Hitler lavishly praised Japan's invasion of China, perversely calling it a "struggle for human civilization." His insults to our country are evident in his words. This reporter therefore visited Mr. Chen Youren, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, presented this issue, and inquired about his views. Mr. Chen immediately gave the following response:</p>
<p>The Principle of Great Deceit and Great Lies</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said: "In his book 'Mein Kampf,' Hitler openly extolled the merits of great deceit and great lies, saying that the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it. His praise of Japan this time is clearly a practical application of this principle of great deceit and great lies. At the same time, the entirety of his speech is also an application of this principle, forcibly justifying the international stalemate created by the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<p>The most important point of current international events is in fact the struggle to destroy the international status quo initiated by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Germany's ambition is to encompass Eastern and Central Europe and seize the oil fields of Romania and Soviet Russia to create its so-called Greater German Reich. At the same time, it also attempts to seize some parts of the African territories of England, France, Belgium, and Portugal to create a colonial empire. Italy's ambition is to control the Mediterranean and dominate the Arabs, and seize the oil fields of Palestine and Mosul as the basis for creating its New Roman Empire. Japan's ambition is to conquer China, dominate the Pacific, and seize the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies, using the banner of 'New Order in East Asia' to establish an expanding Japanese Empire. The seizure and control of oil fields are what Germany, Italy, and Japan are dreaming of day and night today because today is an era controlled by airplanes and tanks.</p>
<p>Countries Maintaining the International Status Quo</p>
<p>This kind of border change can only be achieved through war or through the surrender of England, America, France and the Soviet Union, who are mainly committed to maintaining the international status quo. Because peace is a necessary condition for maintaining the international status quo, England, America, France, and the Soviet Union are objectively the countries of peace today. Conversely, because destroying the international status quo requires the use of violent aggression to achieve, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan are in fact the countries of aggression today.</p>
<p>In order to cover up their aggressive acts, Hitler now has no choice but to use his principle of great deceit and great lies. Also, because the ruling classes of England, America, and France still harbor hatred for Bolshevism, just as the rulers of the feudal era hated capitalism, Hitler shamelessly pretended to condemn the Soviet Union as the enemy of human civilization, while praising Japan's inhumane actions in China over the years, saying: It is serving human civilization.</p>
<p>The Real Threat to Human Civilization</p>
<p>If the best way to maintain the evolution and activities of human society is through peace, and if peace is the true path to human progress, then the various atrocities perpetrated by Germany, Italy, and Japan against humanity's material and spiritual well-being in order to destroy the international status quo are the greatest threat to civilized humanity since the dissolution of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to make a suggestion to those in our country responsible for deciding foreign policy. I believe that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should not sit idly by in the face of Hitler's unreasonable praise of Japan's inhumane behavior in China over the years, and his mental and diplomatic insults to our country, and should immediately issue an appropriate protest.</p>
<p>What I want to say is very simple. Recently, Wang Jingwei advocated that our country join the anti-communist group. The propositions of the anti-communist group are: (1) Destroy China, so that China will no longer become an independent country, (2) Unite all peace-loving countries such as England, America, France, and the Soviet Union as targets of attack. Therefore, forcing our country to join the anti-communist group is not only sacrificing China and offering it to Japan, but also preparing to force China to oppose England, oppose France, and oppose the United States in the great war between maintaining the international status quo and destroying the international status quo.</p>
<h3 id="e15">A Night's Tale with Karman <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guilin]</p>
<p>After dinner, I played a game of billiards with Karman at the "Le" Club. He invited me to his room to talk further.</p>
<p>A Guangxi-made charcoal stove warmly radiated heat. The room, already not very cold for the southern country, felt even more like spring. This man, not yet thirty-two years old, who had traveled extensively through "Spain in Flames" and "China in Struggle," a reporter for the Soviet News and a cameraman for the Soviet Newsreel Studio, didn't seem tired despite having just arrived on a plane from Chongqing. He excitedly poured a cup of hot coffee from a thermos and handed it to me, smiling and saying, "This is hot coffee from Chongqing!" He poured a cup for himself and put a piece of bread on my plate, saying, "Please try the bread flown in from Chongqing!"</p>
<p>Drinking the coffee with its tropical flavor and savoring the soft bread, which I hadn't tasted since leaving Wuhan, I couldn't help but say, "This is truly an interesting thing! But in the future, after China wins the war, you can have morning tea in Chongqing, lunch in Hankou, attend an afternoon press conference in Nanjing, and join a victory banquet and dance in Shanghai!"</p>
<p>He smiled amiably. It was a smile I had become familiar with since he first came to Wuhan from the Soviet Union last September. Afterwards, we shared the hardships of leaving Hubei and Hunan, and finally withdrawing from Wuhan. On a cold morning in Xianning County, I was invited by that smile to eat his sardine bread at a small roadside teahouse, discussing everything about the second phase of the war. After parting in Changsha, we met again in Guilin in early December. After that, he went to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Although he came to our country a year after the start of China's war of resistance, he was more active on the front lines and in the rear than reporters from other countries. He was like an American, possessing the energy and talent of an American journalist. He sympathized with China's war of resistance, witnessing the heroic battles of soldiers shedding blood on the front lines and the tragic bombings of peaceful civilians in the rear, knowing that only by using strength to provide sympathetic assistance to China. Thus, the "Secret Document No. 148" and other dispatches were published in Moscow newspapers, revealing the truth about the Japanese warlords using poison gas to massacre Chinese soldiers and civilians, telling the Soviet people. His "Amo" film reel captured "China in Struggle," allowing millions of moviegoers in the Soviet Union and around the world to observe the Sino-Japanese War more closely. Among foreign reporters, he seemed to be a latecomer, but he was a good friend of the Chinese military and people. His pen and camera facilitated the enthusiastic friendship between the two great democratic nations and peoples of China and the Soviet Union. In Chongqing, during a short month, he was constantly being invited to banquets by Chinese friends, seemingly rushing about every day for these feasts. The Chinese government and the public have already realized the importance of international publicity, and the hospitality towards foreign guests is particularly thoughtful. Tea parties and banquets often keep a foreign guest busy; but besides asking international friends to taste Chinese cuisine, the more important things are to let them "know" and "see" these two things, which are often considered secondary. I feel that this point should be emphasized a little more. He felt that Chongqing City was increasingly under the threat of bombing and should actively focus on passive air defense. He particularly told me that he met Zhao Tong, the commander of the guerrillas near Beiping, in Chongqing, and praised his bravery and courage.</p>
<p>He said, "After China's arduous war of resistance achieves final victory, China will surely be like other of the world's strongest countries. People generally say that China's wealth is underground, waiting to be developed; but in my opinion, that's not entirely true. In Sichuan, I saw coal mining areas that could be mined on the spot. I am particularly interested in Guangxi: tens of thousands of men are fighting a war to defend the country; women are strong, hardworking, and doing all kinds of labor in the rear; and the scenery is so beautiful! As far as I'm concerned, Guangxi occupies the longest section on his film."</p>
<p>He showed me new photos he had taken since leaving Wuhan and explained them to me one by one. News photos taken by a filmmaker have a special artistic flair. I saw Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's resolute and heroic posture at the Nanyue Conference, the grand occasion of senior generals from all over the country gathered together, General Tang Enbo's leisurely demeanor smoking a pipe at the front-line headquarters, the strong and perfect fortifications built by the ××× Division on the Hunan-Hubei front line, the promotion of political work, and the unity of the military and civilians, etc. Through his skills, many photos can often represent a dispatch on a certain issue. As for the records of enemy bombings, they will inevitably arouse anger and sympathy in those who have not experienced them firsthand.</p>
<p>He met Madam Chiang Soong Mei-ling: "When she saw me, she asked me if I could speak English. I said I could. So she spoke to me at length. Actually, my English is not very good, so I didn't understand very well. I quickly said, 'Madam Chiang, I'm sorry. I have difficulty understanding fast English.' So she spoke slowly. She is a very capable woman, a good helper to General Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<p>He asked me many questions about the southern war zone. He will go to the Fourth War Zone in a week, and after returning to Guilin, he plans to go to Beihai again. He wanted me to go with him. I originally wanted to go to Beihai, and if I can return to Guilin after he returns from the Fourth War Zone, he would be a good travel companion to Beihai. I told him that the road to Beihai only goes as far as Lianlin, and he would have to leave the car behind to go the rest of the way on foot.</p>
<p>After finishing the coffee, the conversation turned from the war situation to general topics. He missed Barcelona, which was still in the hands of the Spanish government forces and was likely to fall into the hands of the Fascists. He said, "Once, I was filming in a military uniform factory in Barcelona. It was full of female workers. When they knew I was a Soviet cameraman, the whole place cheered. An elderly woman suddenly embraced me warmly and kissed me. Then, I was surrounded by fifty young female workers who kissed me one by one." He talked about "meeting a Japanese prisoner named Yoshihito in ××, who belonged to the 106th Division. He was the son of a Japanese senior official. The boy tried his best to promote anti-war sentiment." He found many photos of prisoners, and I recognized the Japanese boy. One photo showed a Japanese prisoner, holding a cigarette in one hand and gesturing with the other, sitting opposite a Chinese political worker, reporting their military situation. Finally, we talked about billiards. I said, "I usually play 'pocket billiards'!" He was very happy and said, "In the Soviet Union, there is only 'pocket billiards'! He is also good at 'pocket billiards'!"</p>
<p>As we shook hands and wished each other good night, Karman said, "Let's compete at 'pocket billiards' at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon!"</p>
<p>(January 26, 1939, Guilin).</p>

The gazette expressed satisfaction with Hitler's recent declaration of close cooperation with Italy, and then briefly described the proceedings of the meeting, stating that the Prime Minister had made a general report on the international situation, which was greeted with enthusiastic applause and support from the participants. Foreign Minister Ciano explained the main points of Italian foreign policy, and the Prime Minister made further explanations on important points, and Ciano's report was adopted. The Supreme Council expressed extraordinary satisfaction with Hitler's declaration at the 6th Anniversary of his coming into power, expressing willingness to cooperate closely in political and military affairs between Fascism and National Socialism. "Since the occupation of Girona, Catalonia has been freed from the 'barbaric' oppression of communism. The Supreme Council has paid the greatest respect to the courageous 'Spanish' (?) and foreign volunteer soldiers who have achieved 'victory.' At the same time, it must be stated that the Fascist volunteer army will never abandon this mission until Franco achieves complete victory, that is, until Fascism achieves victory. The official gazette stated that the Prime Minister has announced his plan to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Fascist Rule on March 23rd, at which time the new Fascist United Congress will be opened, and at the same time, at the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the intricate social legislation will also be further developed at that time. The Supreme Council finally reviewed Italy's income and expenditure reports from 1920 to 1928, and the meeting will be continued on the evening of February 10th."</p>
<p>Mussolini Makes No Surprising Remarks, New Offensive Being Prepared in Secret</p>
<p>[Rome, 4th, Reuters] The Italian Fascist Grand Council held its first meeting since last November tonight. It is expected that Mussolini will report on various items and announce his determination until the meeting starts.</p>
<p>Aside from routine matters, will there be anything else surprising in the speech that Mussolini will make?</p>
<p>[Rome, 5th, Associated Press] According to the Italian authoritative magazine "International Relations" weekly, peace in Europe is unlikely before the issue of German and Italian colonies is resolved. The Fascist Supreme Council met last night at 9:00 PM, and the public gathered outside the Venice Palace to cheer. It is said that Mussolini personally presided over the meeting to discuss various important issues.</p>
<p>[Washington, 5th, Associated Press] According to the unofficial authoritative newspaper "Army and Navy Journal," based on the speculation of American naval personnel, Germany and Italy will make new demands after the end of the Spanish war, and the world situation will become the most serious at that time. Italy's demands may be directed towards France, and if the opportunity is ripe, Germany may again raise the issue of foreign colonies.</p>
<p>The French Government Conspires to Collude with Italy, the People Unanimously Oppose</p>
<p>[Paris, 5th, Associated Press] It is heard that the Daladier Cabinet intends to secretly resolve various conflicts between France and Italy. According to reliable official sources, the President of the Annam Bank, Baudoin, has arrived in Rome to conduct negotiations with Italy. Mr. Baudoin's visit to Italy has no official title, but it is said that he was appointed by the French government to negotiate with Mussolini on the railway of Djibouti, which is proposed to be jointly managed by France and Italy as a buffer condition, and the issue of the Mediterranean will also be discussed.</p>
<p>[Paris, 5th, Reuters] The French newspapers are extremely focused on the fact that France sent Mr. de Peysson to Burgos (the location of the Spanish rebel government) as a representative of the French government. The left-wing newspapers unanimously attacked this move, saying that Foreign Minister Bonnet acted without authorization and without the approval of the Cabinet. Right-wing newspapers expressed their approval. According to the "Le Petit Parisien" newspaper, Mr. de Peysson's mission includes the following matters in addition to discussing the refugee issue: (1) To find out whether Franco is willing to accept the conditions put forward by the French envoy and to find out whether Franco requires legal recognition of his government; (2) If France participates in the war, whether Franco is prepared to remain neutral; (3) To require Franco to reiterate his commitment to maintaining the territorial integrity of Spanish territories.</p>

<p>[Burgos, 4th, Reuters] After the rebel army attacked and occupied Girona, it is only thirty-four miles from the French border, and the rear units of the rebel army are sixty miles from Barcelona.</p>
<p>[Paris, 4th, Reuters] As the Spanish rebel army continues to advance, 1,200 members of the government army's security corps have arrived in Bayonne from Collioure today. It is said that all members of the Collioure security team expressed their willingness to return to Spanish territory under the rule of the rebel army.</p>
<p>[Perpignan, France, 5th, Central News Agency] The number of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France has gradually increased, reaching 70,000 to date. The governments of France and Spain have formulated methods to deal with the refugee problem, so the situation at the border is no longer as chaotic as in the first few days. The Sixth Army Corps of the Spanish government army has been driven to the mountains on the Spanish border.</p>
<p>[Perpignan, 4th, Reuters] According to the current rate of advance of the rebel army, Figueres will fall within three days. Government agencies were still working late at night in the basement of the Figueres fortress last night, but the area was repeatedly bombed, and diplomatic envoys were unwilling to visit for any meetings. Currently, refugees are flowing on the French border highway. According to estimates, 70,000 people have entered French territory. The French and Spanish authorities have taken effective measures, so there is no chaos like in the first few days, but there are six government army units now pushing north to the mountain areas on the Franco-Spanish border, and tragedies may occur. In the final stage, these government troops will be forced to retreat on three routes and be bombed by rebel aircraft. The government fleet is now firing up its engines but can do nothing except transport senior officials and technicians to the Valencia and Madrid areas.</p>

<p>[Perpignan, France, 5th, Central News Agency] According to news here, the Spanish government is planning to withdraw from the city of Figueres due to the continuous bombing of the city of Figueres by the "National" army, and the city of Girona (50 miles from Barcelona) has been lost to the west. However, it is not known whether the Spanish government will immediately choose to go to Valencia or Ceret, or whether it will support itself near the Catalan coast for a few more days before taking other measures. According to the progress of the Spanish "National" army, the city of Figueres may fall within three days. Last night, Spanish government personnel were still working in the ancient cellars of the city.</p>
<p>[Paris, 5th, Reuters] A vehicle transporting works of art from the Spanish government from Figueres to the border was bombed by rebel aircraft. It is not clear whether there were any losses.

<p>[Rome, 3rd, Central News Agency] Italian newspapers have recently spared no effort in personally slandering the US President, even using insulting words to say that the President has physical defects. The US government today lodged a formal protest with Italy because of this. The US resident in Italy, Ambassador Phillips, submitted the protest to the Italian government today. According to the situation in which Italian newspapers, under the leadership of Guido, the editor of the Salvation Newspaper and the unofficial spokesperson for Mussolini, are attacking the US President, the US protest states that the US government does not oppose Italian newspapers criticizing the US and its foreign policy, but the US government believes that it is necessary to take formal action against the personal attacks on the President by Italian newspapers. Some Italian newspapers even inferred that the President suffers from paralysis, which causes his "nervous disorder." The Minbao newspaper likened the President to "the first public enemy of peace." Guido, the editor of the News Newspaper, wrote a three-column editorial on the front page of the newspaper, saying that the President is "a disturber of European problems and an instigator of international turmoil" and believes that European problems have nothing to do with the President. In addition, he issued a warning to the American people, saying that the President's proposals will determine the future lives and interests of the American people and said that before criticizing extreme countries, the United States should first recall its own oppression of other nations and commented that the United States' oppression of Indians, Mexicans, and Hawaiians is no more brutal than the means by which Germany and Italy treat the Norman nation.</p>

As a result, the United States shares its interests with Britain and France. President Roosevelt's expression this time is an attempt to contain it. Regarding the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, after the ambassadors and ministers of Japan stationed in various European countries held a meeting in Paris on the 29th of last month, the German Ambassador to Japan, Voth, and the Italian Ambassador to Japan, Oletti, held talks with the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tsurumi, yesterday. It is said that the main points discussed were whether this military alliance should stipulate that when one of the signatory countries goes to war with the Soviet Union or any other country, the other signatory country should be obligated to provide assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e26">空襲不足畏！ <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Tianling</p>
<p>This article is translated from "Breathe Freely" by Professor Janae Eendall, a chemistry professor at the University of Edinburgh, UK. During the European War, he served as a lieutenant colonel in the Allied Chemical Corps.</p>
<p>Popular books describing the tragedies suffered by civilians in large cities during air raids in the next world war often exaggerate the situation. They claim that bombs fall from the sky and poison gas permeates the entire city, or that planes arrive in formation, spreading "death fog," and allege the existence of newly invented, strange poisonous gases that can cause death and cannot be resisted by any gas mask, painting a vivid and alarming picture. However, as a chemist, I dare to assert that all such claims are nonsense.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, scientists have not recently discovered any significant new poisonous gases, and it will likely not be easy to discover any in the future. Scientists knew the killing power of poisonous gases in great detail before the European War (chlorine was discovered in 1774, phosgene in 182, and mustard gas in 1850). Chemists now predict that there will be no more potent poisonous gases discovered in the next ten years than mustard gas. Even if there were, their danger would be so severe that large-scale production would be impossible. In August 1918, before the end of the European War, the Chemical Warfare Service Corps in a mustard gas factory in Maryland, USA, had a higher number of poisoning cases among those manufacturing the gas than the casualty rate of any unit of the same size fighting on the Western Front. In the British mustard gas factory in Avonmouth, none of the 1,100 employees could avoid being poisoned within a few months.</p>
<p>The claim that poison gas can penetrate gas masks is also not a cause for concern. With new scientific methods, the activated carbon used in our current gas masks can absorb even the smallest molecules of any heavy gas and can resist all lighter gases, such as chlorine and phosgene, for a certain period. If sodalime is added to the charcoal, the resistance to poison will be even more durable. Therefore, the anti-poison device in the gas mask can indeed resist any poison gas.</p>
<p>Those who deliberately make alarming claims that air raids on large cities like London will inevitably succeed imagine large formations of bombers dropping thousands of tons of poison gas while the city's residents are unprepared and panic, not knowing what to do. One general wrote about the situation in London after an attack: "The people in the city will be disturbed for days, hospitals will be overcrowded, traffic will be disrupted, and the entire city will become a terrifying hell. The authorities will be overwhelmed by the chaotic situation and will be at a loss. At this time, the enemy will propose peace conditions, and the government will accept them hastily." However, in reality, the advances in modern anti-poison methods far surpass the methods of releasing poison gas. Unless the attack is sudden and unexpected, there will be few victims of poisoning.</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge, the situation in London if attacked would be roughly as follows:</p>
<p>When war is about to begin, the government will distribute gas masks to the people, two for each person, to be carried at all times. Children will bring them to school, and adults will bring them to work. Once news arrives that a large formation of enemy planes is near London, an alarm will sound, and citizens will go indoors, prepare their masks, and put them on immediately upon hearing a special alarm. Half an hour later, the most potent mustard gas will be released from the air in quantity. However, the pedestrians on the street will have already fled, so the city's residents will not be affected by the poison gas, except for those whose houses are hit by bombs or whose windows are broken by flying debris from nearby explosions. Within minutes of the poison gas bombs being dropped, the decontamination team will arrive. An hour later, citizens will remove their masks upon hearing the signal, but will remain indoors. Only when the all-clear signal is given will they resume normal activities. Within a few hours, London will return to its bustling state. Later, newspapers will report that several hundred citizens have been sent to the hospital, most of whom are children and mostly only slightly poisoned. As for the twenty or thirty unfortunate deaths, they were caused by being hit by large pieces of shrapnel. As for the so-called "death fog," it is purely fantasy. It is said that enemy planes can silently release this type of poison gas at high altitude, and this gas is so minute and invisible when released that it explodes upon contact, making it impossible to defend against. However, according to experienced experts, aircraft must fly no higher than 300 feet to release poison gas streams. Therefore, if a city has even a little air defense equipment, there is no need to fear poison gas attacks.</p>
<p>Alarmists often like to mention the fact that one ton of mustard gas can kill 45 million people. However, this refers to those 45 million people standing in line waiting to be poisoned. If that were the case, if all the residents of London were to lie down automatically, a road roller could also crush all the city's residents. However, few people panic and do not know how to avoid an oncoming road roller.</p>
<p>Under ideal conditions, that is, on a windless plain, seven tons of phosgene can only maintain a lethal concentration within a circular area with a radius of 5 yards and a height of 15 feet. The small amount of harm caused by poison gas released in a city can be imagined. I recall that in May 1928, eleven tons of phosgene leaked in Hamburg, Germany, due to an explosion, resulting in 12 deaths, 12 poisonings, and 160 mild poisonings. At that time, the city's residents had not received an alarm, were still coming and going on the streets, and were not wearing gas masks. If people stay indoors, wear masks, and have adequate air defense equipment in the room, they should not be harmed unless a gas bomb hits the building and explodes.</p>
<p>As a chemical expert stated in his air defense pamphlet: We do not need to exaggerate our fear of air raids. During the European War, French farmers living near the front lines would hide indoors when poison gas came, tightly close their windows, and only come out after the gas had passed. At that time, they did not have any anti-poison equipment, but they were still able to avoid harm.</p>
<p>Our preparation for poison gas attacks lies not in the poison itself but in the panic it causes. When the enemy releases poison gas in a city, their primary goal is not to kill people, but to make people panic and long for peace. Therefore, the first thing we must remember during and after enemy air raids is not to panic blindly!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 4th] Regarding the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary, the government's official newspaper, Izvestia, commented that the Anti-Comintern Pact was a prelude to the military alliance treaty concluded by Germany, Italy, and Japan. This is well-known in Moscow. Hungary first signed a cultural agreement with Japan, then recognized "Manchukuo," and recently joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. Although this action is ostensibly anti-communist, it will undoubtedly become a sharp blade in the hands of the aggressor nations. The diplomatic policies pursued by bourgeois countries are based on violence, aggression, hypocrisy, cowardice, and fantasy. The Soviet Union, however, bravely exposes their masks and reveals their true faces, and takes appropriate measures to maintain peace and national independence. The severance of diplomatic relations with Hungary is just one example.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Schnurre, head of the Eastern European Department of the Trade Division of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, originally planned to visit the Soviet Union, but recently postponed the trip. Foreign observers here have commented that there are two main reasons for this. First, the economic delegation sent by the Polish government is currently conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union. If Germany were to send a representative to Moscow at this time, it would inevitably be suspected of competing with Poland. Germany does not want to offend Poland. Second, after France and the Soviet Union become closer, Japan will definitely be unhappy, which is also not what Germany wants. Regarding the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary, some observers believe that Hungary joined the Anti-Comintern Pact fifteen days ago. Why did the Soviet government wait until now, after US President Roosevelt decided to assist the democratic countries, to sever diplomatic relations with Hungary? There are clues to be found in this.</p>
<h3 id="e39">小評　達拉第的反動政策 <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<h3 id="e40">Short Commentary: Daladier's Reactionary Policy <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>慕尼黑會義以後，法國現任達拉第內閣追隨張伯倫的妥協外交反動政策，曾經使法國從歐洲一等强國降到第二三國家的地位。可是達拉第內閣現在還在繼續執行其反動政策，據今天巴黎電訊，他們一面已經派出比拉德氏至西班矛叛軍所在地蒲爾哥斯與意大利指揮下的西叛軍私通欵曲，一面密派安南銀行總裁巴　榮到羅馬與意談判法意妥協。這種反動政策直接犧牲西班牙民主共和國，同時亦將使法國於地位低熟之後再加上殖民　的割讓！</p>
<p>Since the Munich Agreement, the current Daladier cabinet in France has followed Chamberlain's reactionary policy of compromise diplomacy, which has reduced France from a first-rate European power to a second- or third-rate country. However, the Daladier cabinet is still continuing to implement its reactionary policy. According to today's Paris dispatch, on the one hand, they have sent Mr. Bérard to Burgos, the location of the Spanish rebels, to collude with the Spanish rebels under Italian command. On the other hand, they have secretly sent Mr. Baudoin, president of the Banque d'Indochine, to Rome to negotiate a Franco-Italian compromise. This reactionary policy directly sacrifices the Spanish Democratic Republic and will also lead to France's further weakening after its status has been lowered, plus the cession of colonies!</p>
<p>拉達第內　是法國獨佔資本的代理人，他們心目中只有藉出費與戰爭以便私人發財，根本不會顧到國家利益，更不會顧到世界和平！現在的問題，就在法國人民對反動政策容忍到什麽程度？就在法國人民陣綫如何在金融資本的武力之下掙扎起來。推翻達拉第內閣，產生眞正代表人民的內閣。意大利指揮下的四叛軍，距法國邊境只有三十公里了！法國人民不能讓法國永遠屈服下去！</p>
<p>The Daladier cabinet is an agent of French monopoly capital. They only think about making personal fortunes through expenditure and war, and they will never consider national interests, let alone world peace! The question now is, to what extent will the French people tolerate the reactionary policies? How will the French Popular Front struggle under the force of financial capital? Overthrow the Daladier cabinet and create a cabinet that truly represents the people. The four rebel armies under Italian command are only thirty kilometers from the French border! The French people must not allow France to submit forever!</p>
<p>墨索里演詞</p>
<p>Mussolini's Speech</p>
<p>意大利侵略者的法西斯最高會議於四日晚開幕，首相舉索里尼發表演說及報吿，全文尙未發表，但一般觀察，除了對於德國帮助意國侵略表示讚美之外，似不致有驚人的地方。這當然是受了美國和蘇聯當局最近表示積極援助民主國的影響所致。不過我們不能就此認定意大利不會再有驚人之舉，不，當意大利全部征服西班牙之後，他們必更與德國及日本勾結發動更大的暴行，五日美國海陸軍紀事報所稱西戰停止後，德意必將有新的要求提出，實爲依據意　內外危機事實的推斷。只有一個辦法可以防止意德新的要求，那就是英法兩國迅速聯合蘇美，從積極挽救西班牙民主國開始！</p>
<p>The Fascist Supreme Council of the Italian aggressors opened on the evening of the 4th. Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech and report. The full text has not yet been published, but general observation suggests that there will be nothing surprising apart from expressing praise for Germany's assistance in Italy's aggression. This is of course due to the recent expressions of active assistance to democratic countries by the US and Soviet authorities. However, we cannot assume that Italy will not take any more surprising actions. No, when Italy has completely conquered Spain, they will surely collude further with Germany and Japan to launch even greater atrocities. The US Naval and Military Record of the 5th stated that after the end of the Spanish war, Germany and Italy will surely make new demands, which is a deduction based on the internal and external crisis facts of Italy. There is only one way to prevent new demands from Italy and Germany, and that is for Britain and France to quickly unite with the Soviet Union and the US, starting with actively saving the Spanish Democratic Republic!</p>
<p>囚犯集中營</p>
<p>Prisoner Concentration Camps</p>
<p>本港當局現感囚犯日多，各監獄多已超過原定限額，現取法世界各地建集中營收容囚犯辦法，並將各種政府工程分派囚犯祖任，以代獄中苦工。</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities are currently feeling the increasing number of prisoners, and most prisons have exceeded their original limits. They are now taking the approach of building concentration camps to accommodate prisoners, following examples from around the world, and assigning various government projects to prisoners to replace hard labor in prisons.</p>
<p>資本主義社會發展，囚犯的增多是必然的結果，在整個社會沒有改造之前，對於日益增多的囚犯安置問題，實有益趨嚴重之勢，固不僅本港二地爲然。現在建築集中營，自爲安置辦法之一一，因爲既可節省政府公帑，又可實行監獄制度的改善。不過鑒於過去各國囚犯集中營的弊害，爲事前補救計，第一是應該改善及推進囚犯的敎育一，至少使囚犯有讀報，俾獲知世界大勢；第二是改良囚犯的生活，給以相當體育與更人道的物質生活。</p>
<p>The increase in prisoners is a natural result of the development of capitalist society. Before the entire society is transformed, the problem of accommodating the increasing number of prisoners will inevitably become more serious. This is not only true for Hong Kong. The construction of concentration camps is one way to accommodate them, as it can save government funds and implement improvements to the prison system. However, in view of the past abuses of prisoner concentration camps in various countries, the first thing to do in order to prevent these problems is to improve and promote the education of prisoners, at least allowing them to read newspapers to learn about world affairs. The second is to improve the lives of prisoners, providing them with adequate sports and a more humane material life.</p>

<p>The thousands of isolated troops who mistakenly entered British territory, after being relocated by the Hong Kong authorities to the Matou Chung refugee camp, were eager to fight [Japanese] and felt ill-suited to the living conditions. They secretly formed groups and attempted to return to the front lines to serve the country. Because the garrison discovered and stopped them, bloody tragedies occurred many times. Those who were intercepted on the way were also sentenced to imprisonment separately. The issue of the treatment of the isolated troops is one of the reasons for their secret departure from the camp.</p>

<p>醫　總監　力圖改善</p>
<p>Director of Medical Services Strives for Improvement</p>
<p>記者昨以孤軍日常生活之改善問題、舉詢于醫藥總監司徒永覺（氏爲難民營之負責管理人、）據稱、政府規定撥給華軍衣食、巳極度充足，卽西人每日食用此數量亦相當充裕、至華軍之所以發生不滿者、或由於廚子之技術方面、未得完滿、致有所影響、現在已積極加以改淮、舉凡廚夫工役、均以富有經驗者充任、本人前以各難民管理工作、極度冗忙、故未暇及此、現救濟難民、已歸統一、救濟工作、吿一段落、特規定每星期至馬頭涌營巡視一次、如發覺有不善之處、逐步改良、至於禦寒之毛毡衣被、現目亦頗充足、幷就孤軍習慣所需要之娛樂、一一供應、使不致生活上感到寂寞、營中一切設備、已逐漸趨於完備之境、本人責有所司、當竭力謀改善、使華軍不致再有秘密離營之事件發生、</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter asked the Director of Medical Services, Situ Wing-kok (who is the responsible manager of the refugee camp) about the improvement of the daily lives of the isolated troops. It is said that the government's allocation of food and clothing for the Chinese troops is extremely sufficient, and even Westerners would find this amount sufficient for daily consumption. The reason why the Chinese troops are dissatisfied may be due to the fact that the skills of the cooks are not perfect, which has had an impact. Active improvements are now being made. All chefs and workers are now experienced. I was previously too busy with the management of the refugees and did not have time for this. Now that the refugee relief work has been unified and has come to an end, I have specifically decided to inspect the Matou Chung camp once a week. If I find any shortcomings, I will gradually improve them. As for the woolen blankets and bedding for warmth, there are now quite enough of them. Entertainment that the isolated troops need according to their habits will be supplied one by one so that they do not feel lonely in their lives. All the equipment in the camp is gradually becoming perfect. I have a responsibility and will strive to improve things so that the Chinese troops do not secretly leave the camp again.</p>

<p>According to a report in the English Sunday newspaper in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government authorities, in view of the current overcrowding in various prisons, plan to implement a prisoner labor system to disperse them and save a lot of expenses for the Public Works Department. The method is to build a camp, to which all prisoners serving short sentences will be transferred. These prisoners will be used to engage in various public works. According to Prison Officer Wilcox, this method is not new. He implemented this method in the colony where he previously served, and the results were very satisfactory. Concentrating prisoners for work is practiced in many other parts of the world and has become a common trend in modern punishment methods. This measure can not only save a lot of expenditure on public works, but also reduce the cumbersome procedures for registering new prisoners, thereby reducing expenses and personnel. Those sent to this camp are first-time offenders serving short sentences. The work they do may be more difficult than the work they do in prison, but doing it in the open air is naturally more comfortable for the body and mind and far better than living in a cage. This camp will become a permanent facility. It will not be surrounded by stone walls, but only by wire mesh, just like the method of detaining prisoners of war during the last World War. It is now planned to carry out a great land reclamation project in Kowloon Bay, and the work will likely become one of the tasks assigned to these prisoners, but this matter is still under discussion. Also, the number of prisoners in the various prisons in Hong Kong has now doubled the original capacity, and the above-mentioned method has almost become an urgent measure.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The central government has established various methods of rewards and preferential treatment for increasing production and exporting domestic goods, in order to lay the economic foundation of the country during this difficult period of resistance. Overseas Chinese also deeply understand this purpose and give it enthusiastic support, so the export of domestic goods is improving day by day. However, recently, some shameless [Japanese people] have been repackaging [Japanese goods] to pretend to be domestic goods in order to deceive overseas Chinese and seize our domestic goods market. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, seeing this, has telegraphed chambers of commerce in various parts of the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) to pay attention to this matter. In the future, the export of domestic goods will be given concrete proof by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Please investigate to avoid being deceived. As for the incident of pretending to be domestic goods, active measures are also being taken to prevent it. As for the goods transported from factories in Hong Kong to Nanyang, whether they are piece goods, foreign goods, woven goods, hardware, or various other items, they are all inspected by the relevant chamber of commerce. When it is determined that they are indeed domestic goods without error, a corresponding certificate is issued. When overseas Chinese purchase goods, a certificate can immediately determine the truth and the cunning scheme of those who pretend to be genuine [is uncovered], and it is difficult for them to sell. As for the piece goods sold retail in Hong Kong, those that are genuine domestic goods must have a certificate from the Piece Goods Dealers Association, which is hung high in a conspicuous place in the store. Those who do not have this certificate are feared to be counterfeit. Because the prerequisite for obtaining this certificate is to sell genuine domestic goods. If there is any fraud, once discovered, the seller is willing to be punished by the regulations of the Piece Goods Congress with a fine of several hundred yuan to purchase public bonds, and their store name will be publicized as a warning. Overseas Chinese who want to buy genuine domestic cloth or domestic goods must pay attention to this matter. (Luo)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Special Report by This Newspaper: Firewood Shortage! Firewood Shortage! The Tragedy of the Impoverished Class <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Lusheng</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, with the fall of Xiamen and Guangzhou, and the widespread harassment of the South China coastline by the enemy, Hong Kong—this "haven" of "refuge"—has experienced a rapid surge in population due to the influx of refugees from various regions like a tide. The price of all daily necessities has skyrocketed due to demand exceeding supply. Moreover, due to the blockage of transportation in the mainland, the source of goods has been almost completely cut off, leading to constant shortages and deficits.</p>
<p>Living in this "haven" where exchange rates are high and the cost of living increases daily, it is already difficult for refugees and "quasi-refugees" to sustain a basic livelihood, let alone with the manipulation and monopolization by merchants seeking to profit from the "national crisis." Under the distorted state of so-called "rice as pearls and firewood as cassia," the lives of the impoverished class are even more distressed!</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the "firewood shortage," a problem that has been lingering for a long time without resolution. There are many "small issues" that have been overlooked by the bigwigs.</p>
<p>Firewood, which accounts for an important part of the "seven necessities of life," used to be very cheap in Hong Kong. One dollar could generally buy more than a hundred catties. However, now, due to the increase in demand and the disruption of the mainland as a source of supply due to transportation blockades, firewood imported from places like "Singapore" and "Sandakan" has become expensive due to high transportation costs. As a result, the price of all firewood has doubled, and there is still a shortage of supply.</p>
<p>Because of the scarcity of firewood and its price becoming "unattainably high," families with limited purchasing power—or refugees and "quasi-refugees"—often "cherish" things that were previously unnoticed for economic reasons, such as worn-out mats, old wooden clogs, wood shavings, waste paper, etc., and pile them up in front of the stove, even sending them into the stove. Sometimes, they also buy some rotten wood at the entrance that seems to have been dug out of the ground, riddled with termite holes, or some timber stolen by "mountain rats." The price is, of course, a bit cheaper. However, this kind of stolen timber is only dared to be bought by families living in more remote areas, but they often abandon it in large quantities out of a "guilty conscience" due to rumors that the "police" are coming to inspect private firewood.</p>
<p>From the perspective of us "outsiders," Hong Kong, with its tropical climate, has lush trees and mountain grass, and firewood is everywhere. Why the "firewood shortage"? But after living here for a long time, you will know that these are all "royal" "wildlands." Not only are people not allowed to cut them down, but there are also many "police" officers specifically responsible for protecting the trees. If anyone is caught stealing timber, they will be subject to penalties such as fines or imprisonment. Therefore, except for a small number of "mountain rats" who steal firewood for a living, and impoverished people who steal some to sell or use, people with a relatively comfortable life certainly dare not and are unwilling to engage in this kind of "criminal" activity.</p>
<p>In slightly remote mountainous areas, "firewood theft" is often discovered. Every time in the twilight of the setting sun, you can often see some impoverished men and women, covered in dust, in groups of several people, carrying some "stolen" rotten wood and broken branches on their shoulders and backs, sneaking down from the mountain paths like frightened birds. Although the "theft" of those rotten wood and broken branches does not damage the "scenery" of this island in any way, if they unfortunately encounter the "police" guarding the trees, they will inevitably face lawsuits—and imprisonment.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw a poorly dressed, impoverished woman carrying some small, rotten, withered branches that she had picked up, which should not be considered "illegal" in any way, and a few broken wooden clogs, walking along the seaside. Unexpectedly, a "police" officer saw her. Due to excessive panic, in the process of running and struggling, she somehow accidentally fell into the dirty, smelly, and neck-deep harbor. At this time, many people immediately gathered on the shore to watch the "show." The woman stood dripping wet in the sea, soaking in the icy cold seawater. She trembled, staring miserably at the people on the shore, staring at the majestic "police" officer. She never saw a single sympathetic hand. She was poor, she was helpless, she was "breaking the law," her tears flowed like a spring. In despair, everything was despair. She no longer wanted to live so miserably. She suddenly turned around and plunged into the sea. The whole person disappeared. At this time, the people watching the "show" on the shore began to stir, shouting anxiously: Save her! Save her!</p>
<p>In the instant that the woman's life or death was determined, a young man could no longer bear to watch this tragedy. Regardless of the "dignity" of his clothing, he jumped into the sea. He managed to grab the woman's long hair, and with great effort, he managed to save the woman back to shore. However, the woman had swallowed a bellyful of seawater and her face was ashen. She was unconscious. In the end, she was carried away to "report the incident"!</p>
<p>Another time, it was one evening when the night was already getting dark. Near my residence, beside the highway in a depression, a group of poorly clad, impoverished children who had returned from scavenging were gathered around. Each of them had an empty basket hanging on their arms, their eyes glistening with tears as they watched the rotten branches, tangerine peels, and fallen leaves, etc., that they had worked hard to collect all day being confiscated and gathered together to be burned. However, this should be a relatively "compassionate" scene.</p>
<p>"Firewood shortage"! If the "firewood shortage" cannot be resolved and continues to be a shortage, then many tragedies that are not very "pleasing to the eye" will continue to be staged and will increase day by day—although the problem is not limited to being as simple as a "firewood shortage."</p>

<p>The Jinshan Wheel, which once test-sailed between Guangzhou and Hong Kong a month ago, has recently been rumored to resume navigation again. This reporter said that to understand whether the ship would resume, he specifically visited the person in charge of the ship's office yesterday. The answer was: Guangzhou is now a dead market. Even if this ship resumes navigation, our people may not take it back to the province. If there are no passengers and few goods, the cost is too high and it is difficult to maintain for long. This ship is considering this issue. The saying of resuming navigation in these few days will be difficult to achieve. It is also checked that foreign vessels such as Dongan and Dali, which are trapped in the provincial river, have not yet been released. According to yesterday's English weekly newspaper, it said that the foreign vessels remaining in the province would be released back to Hong Kong during the day. This is the result of the British negotiations with the enemy. According to another news, the issue of the official opening of the Pearl River Channel has not yet reached the stage of resolution. The enemy still insists on exclusive occupation, only allowing enemy ships to navigate, and third-country merchant ships cannot touch it.</p>

<p>Recently, smugglers on the border of Hong Kong have been very rampant, smuggling dutiable goods into the mainland in large quantities. In order to step up the work of arresting them, the customs authorities have now organized a motorcycle squad and a special team to patrol between the Kowloon-Canton Railway and the Po Tai Road, so that smugglers have nowhere to escape.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Fishermen's Association Submits a Petition to the Central Relief Commission, Asking the Hong Kong Government to Protect Fishermen, and Sends a Letter to Cai Chusheng Regarding Work Relief Measures, Requesting the Purchase of Fishing Boats for Work Relief Cooperation with Relief Funds <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Acting Member of the Central Relief Commission, believes that fishermen have been ravaged by the enemy, causing them to gather in Hong Kong waters and not dare to sail for work, thus leaving them without a livelihood. He specifically ordered the Fishermen's Association to create a detailed report, so that it could be forwarded to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in preparation for submitting it to the British government for protection. The Fishermen's Association obeyed the order and did so, and yesterday submitted a petition to the Commission. The content of the petition first stated the total number of fishing boats that had been in distress and the total number of casualties, as well as the total value of the property lost, and then described the number of fishing boats in distress in 1939, which had reached as many as forty-six. Finally, it stated the importance of fishing to Hong Kong's commerce, and that most of the fishermen were Hong Kong citizens, appealing to the authorities to negotiate with the British, requesting the Hong Kong authorities to provide protection, or for the Hong Kong authorities to negotiate with the enemy, and that these unarmed fishing boats should not be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Relief for Fishermen: Work Relief Cooperation</p>
<p>Regarding the method of providing relief to fishermen in distress, social figures concerned about this incident have proposed various methods of relief. However, the number of unemployed fishermen is very large, and if the goal is to benefit everyone, it is indeed difficult to plan. Yesterday, the Fishermen's Association specifically replied to Cai Chusheng's contribution of views, and now it quoted its original letter as follows: Dear Mr. Chusheng, Having received your letter, as well as the letter from the Joint Committee of All Sectors of Hong Kong for Relief to South China Refugees to you, I am aware of everything. I am entrusted to draw up a relief distribution plan, etc. The Relief Association, despite its simplicity, tentatively proposes the following: Those in urgent need of relief number no less than thousands, and even women and children number no less than hundreds. Now, because there are many victims and the relief funds are only two thousand national currency, if only women and children are provided with relief and men are not, it seems to be biased in favor of universality. Even if it is limited to women and children, if two thousand national currencies are divided and distributed, each person will receive only two or three yuan. With these two or three yuan, thrifty people can use it for two weeks or one month. If it is not wasted, it will only be enough for a moment. Therefore, although the Relief Association has obtained a fundamental relief for the fishermen in distress, the charitable funds must be used to handle charity that also combines production, so that their talents can be displayed, their skills can be used, and collective economy can be used to benefit a large group. Therefore, this Association has repeatedly stated to the Deputy Chairman of the Central Relief Commission, in order to provide fundamental relief.</p>
<p>Work Relief Measures: Purchase Boats for Fishing</p>
<p>Now, I am entrusted to draw up a distribution plan, and this Association only recommends work relief cooperation as a suggestion, for the following reason: The work relief cooperation method can use two thousand national currency, which is more than one thousand and ten Hong Kong dollars, to purchase four small fishing boats (Gu Zai) for the use of fishermen in distress to fish. This Association, according to the household registration on the People's Livelihood Registration List, selects 515 people whose lives are the most difficult, excluding women and children who cannot work, and 240 people who can work and produce. These 240 people will be divided into several teams, with five people arranged on each boat for each team. Each team is limited to five days, and each person can work for five days. The income earned in five days will be divided into six parts, with each person occupying one part, and the remaining part will be used as a public accumulation for the cost of repairing the boats. In this way, every victim can benefit. All women and children can be given hemp spinning and weaving, which can also obtain a considerable solution, and at the same time, it can promote the first voice of fishermen's cooperation, and the charitable funds will also be used for a long time. How are the above two points considered to be brilliant? If it is in accordance with the intention of Mr. He Xiangning in the letter, this Association does not agree, but only asks to set a method and hand it over to this Association for execution.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Feature: Kowloon Handcart Porters: Request Reduction of Cart Rental Tide Resolved: Cart Rental Restores to Original Price After April 1 <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Braving the piercing cold wind, drinking the icy cold rain, under the spur of life, the handcart porters who still shake their spirits late at night and huddle on the lonely streets to struggle can be regarded as the most tragic workers among the toiling masses in a prosperous city!</p>
<p>Under the chewing of the gears of this great era, the handcart is gradually entering the stage of elimination. In the near future, it will finally become a thing of the past like the horse-drawn carriage, leaving only a page of record in the history of world transportation development!</p>
<p>Here, in this Xiangdao, which is known as Little Dunlun and still maintains the special colors left over from the feudal era, the reason why the handcart profession continues to drag on for a long time is to allow distant tourists to appreciate the unique industry of the Far East. Naturally, it is a miracle of Hong Kong. It is not swallowed by the flood of transportation tools (buses or long-distance cars) because it has a special transportation function that is incredible. Its only life-saving elixir is said to be that it was specially approved to be retained until now because it had served the local "royal family." The handcart porters in the Peak area of Hong Kong are descendants of those who voluntarily participated in the work for humanitarian reasons during the unprecedented World War (?). As for the handcart porters in the Yau Ma Tei to Jordan Road area of Kowloon, they were even given special merit for serving the Hong Kong government during the 1926 war. From that time on, they have been maintaining the work of pulling carts to this day. Their original homes are mostly from Hailufeng. This incident of the Kowloon cart pullers requesting the "pit head" to reduce cart rental also occurred among the handcart pullers in the Yau Ma Tei area.</p>
<p>The matter is like this: In the past, handcart pullers would directly rent carts from the five major handcart owners facing the sea. The daily rent was between four and a half hairs and five hairs. From 1927 to the present, there has not been much change. Only recently did Shi Yanxx's "pit head" (meaning someone who rents a large number of vehicles from the owners and sublets them to the handcart pullers) raise the rent of the 19 handcarts under his name to eight hairs. The cart pullers added this heavy burden. The money earned by their blood and sweat labor every day, after deducting the remaining money from the cart rental, was not enough to maintain their lives. Therefore, they had to ask the "pit head" to reduce it somewhat. After several negotiations between the two sides, the "pit head" was still unwilling to reduce the cart rental. As a result, this group of toiling masses finally complained to the Chinese Affairs Secretary, requesting to uphold justice. After several mediations, it was not until February 1 this year that it came to an end.</p>
<p>It is heard that as a result of this mediation, the workers finally achieved a final victory. Yanxx was only allowed to continue to batch the 19 handcarts for one season (until April 1), and return them to the two major cart owners, Yanxx and Yanxx, when they expired. In the future, each handcart puller will operate as before and can directly rent the cart from the owner, and the cart fee will be the same as the others and cannot be increased. However, a deposit of six Hong Kong dollars must be paid, the purpose of which is to prevent arrears of rent. It will only be allowed to be recovered when the rent is returned.</p>
<p>This trend has been resolved. Although the handcart pullers have achieved a final victory on the surface, during the negotiation process in the past, the cart pullers still had to pay a daily rent of eight hairs and eight cents until April 1 of this year. This unexpected loss still fell on the cart pullers, and there was no compensation! (Min)</p>

<p>— Ke Shaoming</p>
<p>After yearning for a long time, I finally got a seven-day vacation. In advance, we repeatedly planned how to use this short vacation to travel to a place we had never been to before, and change the daily environment that we were tired of. But this problem never had a satisfactory solution, because of time constraints, distant places could not be visited, and eight or nine out of ten nearby places had been visited. At the same time, there were flames of war everywhere, and many places could not be visited. As a result, we got instructions from a travel agency to take Pan American Airlines' Clipper to Manila, visit Baguio and the Pagsanjan Falls in the North Mountain. We went on Thursday and returned to Hong Kong on Wednesday next week on the Western Airlines plane flying from San Francisco. It only took six days, and the round-trip fare, including meals, accommodation and sightseeing, only cost HK$490 per person. At such a low price, we visited the famous Baguio Mountain in the Far East and took the world-renowned Clipper twice. We did not hesitate to realize this plan.</p>
<p>At 7:15 on Thursday morning, we gathered at the Kowloon Peninsula Hotel and took the beautiful bus prepared by the airline to Kai Tak Airport. After checking our passports and weighing our luggage, we took a two-minute motorboat to board the giant Clipper, because it was moored on the water three or four hundred yards from the shore. Mail and guests were transferred by motorboat. The one we took this time was the Hawaii Clipper (the plane went missing a few weeks after the author took it). It was produced by the American Martin factory and was equipped with four 800-horsepower engines, which traveled at 150 miles per hour and carried 28 passengers. After boarding the plane, we took our seats in the order of the numbers on the purchased tickets. The plane was divided into two floors. The upper floor was the cockpit, the radio operator's room, and miscellaneous items such as mail, luggage, and fuel. The front part of the lower floor was the captain's room, the staff room, and most of the middle part was the cabin. The rear part was the bathroom and the kitchen. The comfortable seats could be turned into berths at night, but this route, except from San Francisco to Honolulu, did not fly at night. The berths were only suitable for that section. After taking off at 8:30, we looked down at Hong Kong and the countless large and small islands surrounding Hong Kong and Kowloon. It was a spectacle. Just that moment was worth our flight. Although we were 8,000 feet in the air, except for the engine noise, which was a bit harsh, we did not feel much different from riding in a car. The Hong Kong newspapers and newly published American magazines were available for guests to read that day. Sitting in an armchair, looking at the wonders of the universe, we were unconsciously at noon. We ate a delicious lunch on the plane and arrived in Manila at 2:00 pm. We took a car to the designated hotel to rest. The hotel was newly built and well-equipped, and suitable for the tropics. After putting down our luggage, we walked around. The streets of Manila were neat and clean, with towering trees. The residential area was even more beautiful. People walked in it as if they were in a park. That was Manila's new city. It turned out that Manila was divided into new and old cities. Europeans and Americans, new-style shops, banks, and hotels were mostly in the new city. The old city was built by the Spanish and mostly inhabited by natives. After watching the sunset, we returned to the hotel, because the sunset in Manila was one of the wonders.</p>
<p>The next day, we took a car to tour the city. First, we went to the old city. The streets were clean, but not as good as the new city. The houses were uneven and very different. The moat outside the city wall had been filled and turned into a golf course. We visited Manila Cathedral, the University of the Philippines, and the museum. Unfortunately, we were not very familiar with the historical evolution of the Philippines, otherwise this trip would have been much more interesting.</p>
<p>Originally, we planned to visit Pagsanjan Falls in the North Mountain on the third morning and return to Manila that night. Later, after listening to other people's advice, the North Mountain Falls were suitable for visiting in the morning to avoid the heat of the sun, and the wonders before noon were ever-changing, and they would lose their original appearance after noon. So we went there that day and rested at the Pagsanjan Falls for one night. We got up in the morning, had a light breakfast, changed into our swimsuits, put on a wide-brimmed hat, and walked to the river bank. We boarded a small canoe made of a single log. Each boat could only seat one person, but there were two experienced boatmen in front and behind the boat to steer and paddle. At first, we paddled in the lake, and there was nothing unusual. Only the surrounding cliffs were as high as three or four hundred feet, and coconut trees grew all over the mountains. After paddling for a while, the water became rapid and many waterfalls were discovered. Our small boat went down against the current, which was extremely dangerous. If we were not careful, we would capsize. Even if you were good at swimming, you could not resist the rapids. Fortunately, the boatmen were all experienced. We passed countless rapids and encountered more than five dangers. At the same time, we heard the mournful cries of monkeys, which increased the sadness in our hearts. After two hours, we arrived at a calm inner lake. After resting for a while, we returned along the same road. Although the boatmen were not as tired as when they came, the degree of danger was reversed. We were terrified. After a little over half an hour, we returned to the original place (half an hour less than when we came (everyone breathed a sigh of relief and went to the hotel to change clothes and take a car back to Manila along another road.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, at 6:30 in the morning, we took Philippine Airlines' Pelaika plane to Baguio. The plane was very small in scale, far less than the Clipper. It could only accommodate four passengers. The altitude of the flight was from 1,000 feet to 7,500 feet. We arrived in Baguio one hour later. Baguio is a famous summer resort in the Far East. Even in the hot summer, we still wore autumn clothes. It is said that the people who live there are Iliguae, who are culturally backward and extremely fierce, and are completely different from Filipinos. Not long ago, there were still incidents of killing white people. With the introduction of friends, we stayed at the Country Club. First, we went to the market to see that the Iliguae people were not as scary as rumored, and were also very close to tourists. They carved wooden heads and peddled them to tourists. We bought a few, as well as some wooden carvings as souvenirs, because Baguio is a place that tourists often visit. There are many highways and well-equipped hotels. If you don't take a plane, you can reach it by public bus from Manila in four or five hours. The authorities have also opened several complete golf courses. Tame horses can be rented. We galloped for a while and returned to the Country Club to rest.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, we took the Pelaika plane we took yesterday back to Manila and visited again. In the evening, we went to the lively streets to sightsee again.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, we took the China Clipper from San Francisco back to Hong Kong. Before arriving in Hong Kong, the plane stopped in Macau. Pan American Airlines hired a car for us to tour the entire city. We stayed for about 50 minutes and continued flying. We arrived at Kai Tak Airport at 1:10 pm.</p>
<p>From Hong Kong to Baguio, if you take a plane, you will arrive in Manila on the first day and change planes to Baguio on the second day. It takes three or four days by ship, two days in Manila, and change to a train or public bus to Baguio.</p>

<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>Although it was only two or three years ago, things have changed, gatherings and separations are impermanent. The travel companions of the past are now scattered like clouds and have gone their separate ways. Therefore, although it was only two or three years ago, it seems like a distant dream.</p>
<p>It was the spring of 1936 when school was out for spring break. More than a dozen of us like-minded classmates who often spent time together organized a tour group with Huangshan in Anhui Province as our destination.</p>
<p>We took a train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, and then a long-distance bus from Hangzhou directly to the foot of Huangshan.</p>
<p>The Lullaby of Nature</p>
<p>On the first night of arriving at Huangshan, we stayed at the China Travel Service guesthouse. The place was quiet, and the environment was elegant. Because there were so many of us, although there were not enough beds, I spent the most comfortable night of my life there.</p>
<p>The rustling of the towering trees outside being blown by the wind, mixed with the gurgling sound of the spring water in the deep valley, formed the gentlest lullaby sung by the mother of nature. After the sound of laughter gradually disappeared, I finally fell asleep in the embrace of nature. This was the most memorable sleep in recent years, reminiscent of the restful sleep in my mother's warm embrace in childhood.</p>
<p>A Beautiful Maze</p>
<p>We seemed to have entered a beautiful maze, running east and west among the mountains formed by those huge, unparalleled boulders. We walked a distance, and then another distance, until we were exhausted, still surrounded by mountains. The rugged mountain road seemed endless. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Sun Enlin</p>
<p>Two years ago, going to northern Shaanxi was more convenient in terms of transportation than it is now, but the people were not as straightforward as they are now. Looking back at the scene at that time, there are still things worth recounting. I will write down the journey from Xi'an to Fushi, as far as I can remember. As for issues concerning people and politics, firstly, time has passed and they have become things of the past; secondly, this article focuses on free observation and unrestrained expression, emphasizing only interest and avoiding other topics, so I will omit them all.</p>
<p>It was precisely the season of bright spring in Jiangnan when we—Mr. Yu Songhua and I—arrived in Xi'an. The next day, we encountered a sandstorm the likes of which had not been seen in decades. Looking out from the window of the Xijing Guest House, the whistling wind was swirling yellow sand in the air, obscuring the sky and the earth. The bleak and grayish-yellow scene made this ancient city of Chang'an appear particularly arid and cheerless.</p>
<p>After the strong wind came rain. The clay roads in the Northwest became impassable to vehicles when wet, so we didn't set off for northern Shaanxi until the fourth day. In advance, we had made arrangements at "Seven Sages Village" and hitched a ride on a grain truck. From Xi'an to Fushi, it normally takes two days, but most of these freight trucks were already old, and they were carrying thousands of pounds of grain. Like a gaunt, old ox, even with the whip, they were beyond help. We departed from Xi'an on the morning of the 4th and didn't arrive in Fushi until the afternoon of the 16th.</p>
<p>There were a total of five large trucks going to northern Shaanxi that day. Mr. Weng and I each occupied a seat next to the driver in two different trucks. Before we set off, we had already inquired about the simple travel accommodations and food along the way, and we also received good intentions from those who were hosting us. They first explained to us: "I'm afraid you two gentlemen are not used to it. It would be better if you could bring your own bedding and sundries." So we asked Mr. Zhou from the guest house to rent four cotton quilts and purchased flannel blankets, washbasins, mouthwash cups, goggles, flashlights, thermos bottles, canned food, etc. Mr. Yu also bought some cigarettes—including the mild "Three Cannons" brand. When I checked my luggage, I also put milk malt extract powder, sugar cubes, and wheat biscuits that I had brought from Shanghai into the basket. At first, we felt really ashamed, why couldn't we live a few days of the simplest life? But later we felt that traveling in this "remote wilderness" of northern Shaanxi, bringing some cigarettes wouldn't hurt, and we packed the basket full. The tires of those old trucks, when climbing uphill, wouldn't slip or fall back easily.</p>
<p>It was not easy climbing to the top of the mountain. The truck needed to add water and be repaired, the drivers needed to rest, and we also took the opportunity to get out of the car and stretch our muscles. The top of the mountain was a flat piece of clay land, which really surprised us. We smoked our cigarettes and drank the boiled water we brought, pacing on this mountain top with its strange and fantastical scenery. Looking up, many of the mountain peaks were flattened, as if countless large round tables had been placed there, but the tabletops were empty. Some mountains showed huge scars—as if mad gods had fought there, and the giant spirits had broken them with their palms, the streaks of the traces were very obvious, like giant candles burning in nature, and the candle tears had formed countless miracles. Although the mountains stood still, our eyes, when staring at this mountain or that mountain for a little longer, seemed to see many ancient, huge beasts rising slowly with the smoke swirling around our fingers, jumping between the mountain ridges and giant valleys; the more we looked, the more unclear it became, illusions, clouds... Suddenly we heard the car driver shout, "The car is fixed, everyone get in and let's go!" We then threw our tiny cigarettes into the deep valley and re-embarked on our journey.</p>
<p>Near Yijun, the terrain was the highest, with dozens of ascents and descents, we finally reached Luochuan, the closest point to Yan'an, and stayed overnight. Along the way, in addition to experiencing the northern Shaanxi scenery of the yellow sand and barren land, we also encountered many simple and honest common people. On the road, we often saw a clumsy ox cart coming towards us. The inability of the car to yield to the ox cart was really like city people looking down on country people. So the Shaanxi people with their heavy accents would anxiously jump out of the car and try to drag the ox to the side of the road. The ox's brain was even more unclear, and the villager's situation was even more anxious. On the one hand, he was afraid that the car would crush the livestock or overturn the things on the cart—nothing more than some coal, fodder, or firewood, and on the other hand, he could hear the drivers who were used to fast roads cursing there. That kind of embarrassing and pitiful situation was constantly revealed in his "trying every possible means." Some villagers, driving mules carrying coal on their backs, galloped in the mountain roads, making "hissing" sounds in their mouths to urge the livestock to run faster. They ran dozens of miles a day, selling the heavy and worthless coal, and the reward they got was less than a few dozen coppers. Some people regard sugar, tea, or water fruit as having incredible wonders.</p>
<p>The "Weiyang Ancient Ferry" loomed before our eyes. Before reaching Sanyuan, we had to cross the historically famous Wei River and Jing River. There were wooden elms erected on the river surface, which looked not very strong. Fortunately, there were some square-headed wooden boats lying under the bridgehead, supporting the bridge surface and acting as pillars in the middle of the river. When we saw this situation, we couldn't help but feel uneasy. Fortunately, the people in the car all felt the same way, so everyone got out of the car and walked across the bridge. The drivers, however, disregarded everything and drove one by one to the other side. Many mules, horses, and handcarts used square-headed ferries to cross the river, and some also walked across the bridge. The water in the Wei River was originally very turbid, and the flow was not rapid. In the eyes of Southerners, is this kind of river worth missing? However, since passing the Jing River, all the way to Yan'an, there were no wide rivers except for a few streams.</p>
<p>We spent a night in Yaoxian. On the way to the second rest stop, Luochuan, we had to pass through Tongguan, Yijun, and the middle part—the location of the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum—the terrain gradually became higher, and the car road suddenly went low and suddenly high, climbing over mountains and ridges, and winding around. All that met the eye was ochre-red and grayish-yellow soil mountains. Don't underestimate the soil mountains here, they don't refer to ordinary small mounds or randomly piled mud. They are many strange and fantastical scenes, sometimes after looking at them for a long time, it almost makes people go crazy. According to geologists, these many loess soils were blown eastward from Mongolia by the strong winds of Central Asia thousands of years ago, and over time, they became the strange phenomenon they are now. The car struggled to climb the mountain from the valley, and the creaking sound clearly told people that it was doing its duty to the fullest. However, the driver had to do his duty even more, stepping on the highest gear and opening the accelerator to the maximum. This poor car was fighting with the steep mountain slope with its last drop of blood. Of course, it was even slower than walking, moving forward step by step. The freight truck I was riding in, in addition to the driver, also had an assistant. At this time, his work was extremely tense. He was holding a huge wooden mallet in his hand. When the car was climbing uphill, when it was at its most critical moment and about to "lose power," he would wedge this large wooden mallet under the rear wheel. In this way, he helped this responsible and old car, not even for a copper penny.</p>
<p>The life of the people in northern Shaanxi can be represented by four colors—red, yellow, gray, and black. They live in cave dwellings—caves dug in the yellow earth mountains, they eat coarse noodles or hard steamed buns, which are gray and yellowish. They are served with red chili sauce and gray salt. The clothes they wear, although they were not originally black, are covered with a lot of gray sand and yellow earth due to lack of water. They are shiny and oily, and if they are not black, they are black. Everything seems to be no simpler or cruder. If people's property, clothing, housing, etc., can be calculated in thickness, then the people of northern Shaanxi, apart from their naked bodies, are only covered with a thin film.</p>
<p>In Luochuan, we met Mr. Liu, the director of the radio station, from Wujin, and Mr. Chen, the director of the telegraph office, from Ningbo. Thousands of miles away from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they were naturally very happy to meet us Jiangnan people. And us, although we had only left Shanghai a week ago, because the change in the environment was too drastic and too rapid, it seemed like we had been away from our hometown for several years. At first sight, we also felt a sense of "meeting an old friend in a foreign land."</p>
<p>In the afternoon, as the faint sunlight shone on the city walls of Yan'an and was about to fade westward, we entered this ancient city. Because they had already received notice from Xi'an, someone came to greet us and put us up in the guest house. Although we slept on earthen beds and ate gray steamed buns, we met some famous people who were doing many complex and difficult tasks and living the simplest and most humble lives.</p>
<p>Night came, and I walked back from the street. There were no gas lamps, let alone electric lights. Many common people and vendors were doing business under the dim candlelight and oil lamps. They sold roughly made handicrafts, hard steamed buns, noodles, cakes, and some vegetables. The streets were also quite lively, but around seven or eight o'clock, the market dispersed. Darkness and calmness were intertwined on the streets of Yan'an, because although the people there had weapons, they did not necessarily wear leather shoes. Except for hearing faint command sounds from afar and seeing the bright flashlight light in the darkness, you wouldn't know that there were still people walking on the dark streets. This is the "night" of Yan'an.</p>

<h3 id="e60">A Conspiracy to Destroy Our Silk Industry <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ma</p>
<p>Seizing silk factories in the war zone, with no time to take care of sericulture farms. On the one hand, it is also because there are not yet degenerates in the sericulture seed industry like Zhang Zizhen and Qian in Wuxi who are loudly denounced. Although there are also people who collude with the puppet government, on the whole, they can still maintain the dignity and integrity of the sericulture seed production farms of the Republic of China. This is the evaluation of the war zone sericulture seed industry's perseverance and struggle under such difficult circumstances for the past year.</p>
<p>However, the occupied area is still an occupied area. The Japanese conspiracy against China as a whole is ultimately fierce and vicious, and You Xiaobiao's (the second section chief and technician of the Construction Department of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, and concurrently the director of the Sericulture Control Office, who is actually the highest authority in sericulture administration in the puppet Jiangsu Province) is ultimately just a spineless traitor. Trying to continue operating sericulture seed production in the occupied area according to the previous policy, or trying to maintain the status of the sericulture seed production farm under the protection of people like You Xiaobiao, or even taking the opportunity to gain some benefits, is all a pipe dream. Because in business, (1) no eggs are left unbroken under an overturned nest, (2) slaves have no right or courage to interfere with the "master" (?) and participate in the end discussions. These are the two preconditions that the war zone sericulture seed industry should fully recognize.</p>
<p>Therefore, we further discuss the recent attack of the "Central China Silk Company" on the sericulture seed production industry in the war zone.</p>
<p>Two or Five Conditions for Destruction</p>
<p>Recently, in order to implement control over the sericulture seed industry in the war zone and to achieve the extraction or destruction of the entire silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the "Central China Silk Company" has proposed "cooperation" to the Hushu Pass Dayou Sericulture Seed Production Farm, which has always been known as the oldest and largest brand in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. This is the first shot fired by the Japanese at the sericulture seed farms in the war zone, and it is undoubtedly intended to be promoted to all the sericulture seed farms in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zone. The terms of cooperation are tentatively set at five, which are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The original seeds must be purchased from the company and may not be reproduced or transferred.</p>
<p>(2) The company will send a technical advisor, and the farm will pay the salary.</p>
<p>(3) The disease rate shall not exceed 3 per 1000.</p>
<p>(4) The manufactured silkworm seeds shall be sold by the company and shall not be sold or transferred to others. Half of the seed money will be paid upon delivery of the seeds, and the remainder will be paid after July for spring seeds and after October for autumn seeds.</p>
<p>(5) If the silkworm seeds issued produce poor results, the farm will be responsible for compensation.</p>
<p>Among the five conditions, the first, fourth, and fifth are the most vicious. The second and third are merely supplementary to these three. I will analyze them further below.</p>
<p>Regarding the first article, it actually contains three sinister meanings. First, of course, it is to control the silkworm varieties in the war zone, causing the excellent varieties originally cultivated by several larger sericulture seed farms to be eliminated. In this way, on the one hand, various farms will not be able to obtain original seeds for breeding to produce ordinary silkworm seeds unless they cooperate with the "Central China Silk Company." In other words: they will rely solely on the Japanese, so the existence and elimination of silk can be completely controlled by the Japanese supply of original seeds. Second, since the war, Japan has restricted the import of wool, but because Japan's wool production is poor, it has to find other remedies, so there is the so-called cocoon-quality wool (that is, cocoons are treated with chemicals to make them a fiber similar to wool). Not only are the cocoons used as raw materials for cocoon-quality wool not necessarily as good as the raw materials for silk, but they are actually more suitable for cocoons that are unsuitable for silk making, so after promoting breeding in the country, it was met with fierce opposition from the silk industry, the reason being that the promotion of this kind of inferior raw material cocoons will inevitably greatly affect the production of excellent cocoons for silk making. Therefore, if the Japanese control the original seeds in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zone, so that various farms buy their products, they will of course take the opportunity to import this type of variety into the war zone, on the one hand, they can get the Chinese in the war zone to produce raw materials for them, in order to achieve their purpose of squeezing, and on the other hand, they can alleviate the opposition from the domestic silk industry. Third, the Japanese have always regarded China as an enemy country of their silk industry, because China has a vast land and abundant labor force, and the silk industry still has great potential for development. Japan is just the opposite. Precisely because of this, the threat to the Japanese silk kingdom is also the greatest. Therefore, after the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the main areas of China's silk industry, the Japanese government has repeatedly sent authorities from the domestic silk industry, such as Kogure of Higashi-Taka Sericulture, Fukumoto, and Hayashi Teizo of Ueda, to successively investigate and view sacrifices, in order to obtain an overall policy on Chinese silk. At that time, the Japanese argument was that there were two types of complete elimination and development, but now the Japanese conspiracy is to adopt controlled development elimination in the war zone, that is, to carry out controlled development in the war zones such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Except for the Japanese, the Chinese side has no buying and selling relations with other foreign countries, so that the position of Chinese silk in the world consumer market will be terminated and eliminated. In this way, there is no need to worry about the competition between Chinese silk and Japanese silk, and the treasures of the silk industry in the war zone can be obtained. Once the original seeds in the war zone are controlled, this goal can of course be easily achieved. The most obvious example is that if the silkworm varieties that are unsuitable for silk making are promoted in the war zone, then the silk factories in Shanghai and the small silk factories in the war zone will not be able to and will not bother to collect the raw material cocoons produced in the war zone, because these cocoons are no longer the raw materials needed for silk making. This is the so-called "establishment of a century-old plan" loudly advocated by the Japanese, and it is also the veneer of "economic cooperation" that the Japanese government calls for.

<h3 id="e62">Special Silver Plate Replay: Eastern Eliminates South China; Liu Zhuhan of Eastern Deserves Primary Credit; South China's Weak Defense Leads to Two Goals Lost Due to Carelessness <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Our Report) Eastern Athletic Club's football players have shown remarkable progress recently, leading to their victory over South China in the league the previous week. Yesterday, in the special silver plate replay against South China, they once again achieved a major victory and secured a spot in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Yesterday's major victory for Eastern can be primarily attributed to Liu Xianhan. During the first ten minutes of the first half, South China's offensive was extremely strong. Chen Dehui, Yang Shuiyi, Qu Shi'e, and others had multiple opportunities to make brilliant shots that seemed certain to break through the goal. At that time, Xianhan alone was able to turn the tide amidst the overwhelming attacks, successfully preventing any goals from being scored. This allowed the entire team to seize a counter-attack opportunity, leading to Hou Chengtuo's successful strike. Therefore, Xianhan's contribution was greater than anyone else's.</p>
<p>During the first half, South China generally had more momentum, but they were thwarted by Xianhan's defense, leaving them sighing in vain before the goal. If they had managed to score first during their intense offensive, it would have boosted their morale significantly and potentially prevented the first two careless losses. However, the outcome of the game is sometimes beyond human control, and the changes in war are infinite and unpredictable.</p>
<p>In Eastern's performance, Xianhan and Chengtuo stood out, but the rest of the team also performed their duties well. Their ability to withstand the initial dangers in the defense was particularly commendable. Although their first two goals can be attributed to chance, the team's unified spirit was unmatched by South China. Their ultimate victory was not without reason.</p>
<p>As for South China's defeat, the blame lies in their weak defense. Lin Depu's injured appearance affected his performance, while You Huaxing kicked and passed blindly, failing to stop Chengtuo's progress. Therefore, the only reliable defender was Xie Jinhong, who barely met expectations. Consequently, they lost control in both offense and defense and were unable to withstand the pressure. Eastern was thus able to take advantage of the opportunities and launch attacks.</p>
<p>Liu Mao and Liu Weipei offered nothing commendable and repeatedly made mistakes. The loss of the first two goals was due to their carelessness. However, Tan Jun'gan, who missed the catch on the second goal, cannot escape blame either.</p>
<p>Someone said to the reporter that although South China's defeat was due to the defenders' mistakes, the biggest reason was the error in team formation. It was already a mistake to abandon Liang Bowei in the right-back position and use Bi Xing, who had courage but lacked strategy. Secondly, Depu's foot injury had not yet healed, so he should not have been sent to play in this crucial match. Therefore, their defeat was due to the mistakes of those responsible for the lineup and should not be entirely blamed on the players.</p>

<p>The referee blew the whistle to start the game. South China launched a fierce attack first. After four minutes, Shi'e crossed from the baseline, and Dehui shot, but it went high above the goal, missing a great opportunity. After nine minutes, Dehui swept the ball towards the corner of the goal, but Xianhan managed to save it in time. After ten minutes, Eastern launched a counter-attack. Jingcheng and Ling collaborated to advance, then Qi and Liu Mao kicked the ball simultaneously. The ball bounced off Deqi and he passed it to Chengtuo, who ran quickly and kicked it into the net, giving Eastern a 1-0 lead. After twelve minutes, South China launched an attack. Huaguo jumped high to head the ball, avoiding South China's rush and conceding a corner kick. Songsheng took the kick, and Dehui headed the ball towards the goal, but Xianhan managed to push it out. When Shuiyi took the third corner kick, Songsheng fouled, and the defense was relieved. After fifteen minutes, Shuiyi took a long shot while running, and Xianhan jumped to catch it, conceding another corner kick. South China was able to benefit from this. In an instant, Shi'e, seeing an opportunity, launched an attack, but Xianhan fell to the ground and pushed it out of bounds. Although South China got a corner kick, Eastern's defense worked together to save the ball. After surviving the crisis, Eastern's good fortune arrived. Ling quickly passed to Chengtuo, who used his old trick, running around and attacking the goal. Jun'gan fell to the ground to catch the ball, but the ball was too strong and slipped out of his hands. Bingtu rushed forward and pushed it in, scoring another goal. After twenty-nine minutes, Lingsheng passed the ball to Bingtu. Bingtu, being in defense, passed it to Deqi. Deqi dribbled past Weipei and passed it to Chengtuo. Chengtuo then swept the ball into the net, making it 3-0, ending the first half. Switching sides to start the second half, Eastern continued to work hard. After six minutes, Deqi received Chengtuo's pass, turned around, and shot the ball into the net, scoring the fourth goal and securing the victory. After ten minutes, Huaguo tripped Dehui in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Shuiyi took the kick and scored, breaking the shutout. After thirty-two minutes, Eastern became slightly lax as the end of the game approached and was attacked fiercely by South China. Songsheng took the opportunity to score a goal. The game ended soon after, with Eastern eliminating South China by a score of 4-2.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Shanghai Student Tennis Team Loses to South China 2-3; Tang Baojia Shows Promise <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai student tennis team competed against the Hong Kong University team the day before, demonstrating their strength and achieving a great victory. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, they competed against the South China Athletic Association team at the Hong Kong Cricket Club, and South China won 3-2.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai University tennis team arrived in Hong Kong, they were busy and I had not seen them practice. The day before, I was unable to watch the South China-South China special silver plate match and could not spare the time to go to Pok Fu Lam to watch them play. I was very eager to see them play. Yesterday, I learned that they would be playing against members of the South China Athletic Association at the King's Park South China Athletic Association tennis court at 2:30 PM, so I went to watch them first before heading over to watch the Guanghua-Foreigner football match. Fortunately, they played their best two singles matches first, allowing me to catch a glimpse of Tang Baojia and Li Guofan's performances.</p>
<p>At that time, Tang and Li were playing Chen Zhiqiang and Huang Funan simultaneously on two courts. I was also invited by Mr. Chen Guangyao to be the baseline judge for Tang and Chen's match, so I can only talk about Tang's skills. Tang and Chen's match finished first. Although I briefly watched Li and Huang's match, I only saw the last two games, so I dare not comment on Li's skills. I can only say that he is small and agile, and can be described as steady. As for how good his ball skills are, I will have to wait until I see him again before I can offer my opinion. Yesterday, I was distracted by the football match and left before 4 PM, so I did not get to enjoy the third singles match or the two doubles matches.</p>
<p>In the match between Tang and Chen Zhiqiang, both players had large and sturdy builds, and both had powerful strokes. It can be said that they were evenly matched in terms of strength. However, Tang is young and lacks experience. He was also unfamiliar with the court, and Chen performed exceptionally well, so in comparison, Tang seemed to lack in many aspects. He lost both sets by a score of 6-3, 6-3, which seemed to represent the difference in their skills yesterday.</p>
<p>Tang is a promising talent and may improve significantly in the future. However, his ability to predict incoming balls seems too quick, and his footwork is often chaotic. I did not see any particularly impressive shots or high shots, and he did not show much skill at the net. Yesterday, Chen Zhiqiang dominated him at the net and never gave him a chance to get there. His first serve was decent, but his second serve was weak. However, he sometimes managed to sweep the ball near the line and was good at seizing opportunities for quick attacks and passing balls. His long shots from the baseline were too high and not good enough. If he does not improve his footwork, it will be difficult for him to make significant progress. His speed and stamina in saving balls are his strengths. However, in Hong Kong today, he is only a top ten player.</p>
<p>In yesterday's match, Chen Zhiqiang lost the first two games, then came back to tie it 2-2, then lost two more games, before coming back to 3-4. He then lost three more consecutive games to lose the first set 3-6. In the second set, he won the first game, then the score became 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-2, and then he lost four consecutive games to lose 3-6. Li Guofan defeated Shang Funan by a score of 6-1, 6-4.

Fourth place: Wu Song (Individual) with a time of 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds. Fifth place: Liang Ruiguang (Youth Cycling Team) with a time of 1 hour, 31 minutes, and 5 seconds. The results of this race were not good and failed to break the previous record of 1 hour and 6 minutes. It is said that the association will hold a 50-mile race in March.</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Soldiers Give Their All; Guanghua Defeats St. Joseph's Again; Dagaoshannu and Biludo Have No Place to Show Their Skills; Guoqi and Rongsheng Display Their Skills <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Guanghua and St. Joseph's met again at the Kowloon Club at 4:15 PM yesterday. This was a first division football league match. In the first match, Guanghua defeated St. Joseph's 3-1. Yesterday, when they met again, St. Joseph's was determined to avenge their defeat and deployed a full squad. The famous player Dagaoshannu was assigned to the front line, and Biludo was assigned to the center back position. Therefore, in terms of strength, St. Joseph's seemed to have the upper hand. However, after a fierce battle, Guanghua won again with a score of 2-1, a truly outstanding performance.</p>
<p>In this match, St. Joseph's offensive line was very active and constantly besieged Guanghua's goal, making it impenetrable. Biludo's performance as a center back was also excellent. However, the internal defense was not strong enough to stop Guanghua's attacks. This was the reason for their defeat. On Guanghua's side, Li Guo, Hou Rongsheng, Zhuo Shijin, and Zou Wenzhi all made excellent contributions, which laid the foundation for their victory. Zhong Huilin's movements were rather slow and sluggish. Fortunately, Guoqi and Rongsheng defended effectively, turning danger into safety. The three midfielders also worked hard, but their skills were insufficient to contain the opponent's front line. The five forwards were all lively and worked well together, which allowed them to secure the final victory in this fierce battle.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, both teams displayed their skills. Guanghua's players launched two attacks on the opponent's goal, but were blocked and forced to retreat. St. Joseph's immediately launched a counter-attack. Rong Niu used his great strength to repel the attacking players. After a while, Guanghua's forwards became active again. Chi Fen dribbled the ball forward and reached the opponent's territory. Sima Fashi committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Shi Jin took the kick and scored, giving St. Joseph's a one-goal lead. The St. Joseph's players then launched an all-out counter-attack, with even the two internal defenders crossing the center line to assist. After five minutes of intense fighting, Guanghua was in constant danger. Fortunately, the entire team gave their all and managed to temporarily hold their ground. Shi Jin then broke through and attacked along the side, making two beautiful crosses. On the latter occasion, it was a sure chance to score, but Chi Fen failed to rush forward in time, missing the opportunity.</p>
<p>After a while, Biludo sent a pass forward. Dagaoshannu intercepted the ball and shot at the goal. Guoqi fell to the ground and blocked it, but Huilin kicked the ball weakly. Aruo Wushi happened to be in front of the goal and took the opportunity to shoot it into the net, tying the score. At this point, the situation became very tense, and there were many exciting moments. Soon after, Rongsheng saved the ball and Jingcong received it and attacked. After reaching a suitable position, he crossed the ball. Wenzhi rushed forward to meet it and kicked the ball into the net. Maguishi missed the save, and Guanghua took the lead again with a score of 2-1. After that, Guanghua was besieged again. Li Anna and Dagaoshanu shot at the goal one after another, with shots raining down. Fortunately, Guoqi was a skilled goalkeeper and managed to defuse the danger one by one. Soon after, the first half ended. After the break, the battle resumed. At this time, the St. Joseph's players had high morale and were very active. Guanghua's capital was constantly under attack. Dagaoshannu had many opportunities to shoot at the goal, keeping Guoqi busy. Fortunately, all the soldiers fought bravely and managed to escape the danger. Then, Guanghua's two wings launched a counter-attack, but the opponent's defense was very strong and they were quickly repelled. However, St. Joseph's had the upper hand at this time, but they had bad luck and were unable to recover their lost ground. In the last five minutes, St. Joseph's launched a more intense counter-attack, but time ran out, and the battle ended. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Guanghua Association)</p>
<p>Li Guoqi</p>

<p>Entertainment! The Secret of a Rich Girl</p>
<p>There Goes My Heart</p>
<p>This is an American-style comedy. The story and plot arrangement are entirely for the purpose of achieving comedy. The director's surprising and victorious techniques have created many fresh jokes for the audience in this film. The plot's crazy and humorous elements are also very attractive.</p>
<p>The film depicts the story of a rich girl who is inexperienced and craves freedom running away from home, and how she falls in love with a reporter under special circumstances.</p>
<p>Frederic March and Virginia Bruce are not very good protagonists and did not achieve much in the film. They performed averagely. Patsy Kelly is bright and cheerful and gave a very outstanding performance. She is a lovely clown. Nancy Carroll plays a vain and jealous shop assistant. This is her second performance since returning to the screen, and the result is not bad.</p>
<p>Showing at the Queen's...</p>
<p>Peace... Sixty Glorious Years of the British Royal Family</p>
<p>Sixty Glorious Years</p>
<p>This film also depicts the glorious history of Queen Victoria's life, but it is more detailed than the previous one. It includes many important achievements during her sixty years in power. In order to pursue truth and authenticity, it was specially produced by the British Royal Company, but it is somewhat of a promotional film for the history of the British Queen.</p>
<p>Because the material is particularly rich and the material is precious, it cannot be omitted or deleted. Under these circumstances, it is not easy for the director to please the audience and handle it properly. This film suffers from this problem. The whole play, except for the first half, which depicts the Queen's life after marriage, is slightly vivid and lively. In the second half, it can only introduce historical fragments as a matter of power. One cannot blame the director's limited skills.</p>
<p>There are several very excellent scenes in the film, such as the Queen's life after marriage, the British Royal Army's impact, the Queen's Jubilee celebration, and the visit to her old maids of honor. They are all worth mentioning. In terms of actors, there is not much change from the previous "The Story of Queen Victoria." Anna Neagle, who plays the Queen, gave an excellent performance, especially in her old age. Anton Walbrook, who plays Prince Albert, is also very excellent.</p>
<p>Eastern... That Certain Age</p>
<p>That Certain Age</p>
<p>This film depicts a precocious girl who falls in love with a reporter who is twice her age. He initially does not know this. After realizing this, he tries his best to dissuade her, but to no avail. In the end, another woman resolves the situation.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Deanna Durbin is even more beautiful in this film. Not only is her performance delicate and lively, but she has also made significant progress. The male lead, Melvyn Douglas, is very qualified, just like Marjorie Rambeau in "The Primrose Path." Jackie Cooper still reveals his innocent acting skills.</p>
<p>The four new songs inside are also quite moving.</p>
<p>Tai Wah... Swiss Miss</p>
<p>Swiss Miss</p>
<p>This is Laurel and Hardy's penultimate film. The story is about two cheese sellers (Laurel and Hardy). Once, they went to Switzerland to do business, and the two foolish guys made a lot of jokes. Some places are indeed lacking, but that is precisely because it is a comedy.</p>
<p>There are also two European singers participating in the performance, especially the woman's singing is very good. The two treasures perform the same as before.</p>
<p>New World... Modern Woman Seeking Husband</p>
<p>Cantonese Silent Film</p>
<p>This is adapted from the stage play "Modern Woman Seeking Husband." The plot tells the story of a millionaire who is unusually stingy. He not only refuses to contribute to any public welfare undertakings but also wants to take advantage of others. At this time, various sectors have launched a campaign to raise funds to establish a Chinese industrial factory and want to ask him for help. However, as a result, he not only does not take out a penny but also stole some pastries at the meeting. Therefore, everyone devised the "Modern Woman Seeking Husband" plan to trick him and then use female charms to seduce him.</p>
<p>The main characters are stage stars, Ma Shizeng and Tan Lanzhen, which is also the producer's business sense.</p>
<p>The director's techniques are still quite good.</p>
<p>Central... Black Clothes Team</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>This film depicts two disparate classes in society: on the one hand, the hard-working women of the masses, and on the other hand, some leisurely class playboys. However, the director's description of each plot is too focused on achieving the goal of "sensuality" and ignores the expression of reality. At the same time, for the sake of "sensuality," the film is filled with low-level, vulgar, flirtatious, and chaotic elements.</p>
<p>The plot depicts a weak woman whose husband went abroad to earn a living. Her family was not well-off, forcing her to work as a maid and endure all kinds of bullying and oppression. When her husband returned home with honor, all kinds of misunderstandings arose.</p>
<p>Half of the film is loose, and most of it is performed in the form of opera, in an attempt to cover up the emptiness of the content. The director's techniques are also not refined enough. However, the actress Huang Manli's excellent performance in this film cannot be buried and is worth praising.</p>

<p>(Our Report) The Navy and the Scottish Regiment drew 2-2 in the first week, with no clear winner. Yesterday, they met again, and the Navy crushed the Soviet Army 6-0. The Soviet team's defeat was expected, as they had lost several good players to returning to their home country. The team's foundation was unstable. When they met this maritime bully yesterday, the difference in strength was already apparent. Their main player, Bo Yudu, was also absent, weakening their defense. As soon as the game started, the situation became one-sided. The Navy's victory was due to their solid defense. Newley played again, preventing Hodges' threat. The offense and defense were consistent, and the coordination was flawless. Armstrong showed an amazing performance, dribbling, passing, and shooting with ease. He deserves the most credit. The rest of the team also performed well.</p>
<p>In the Division B match, the Engineers defeated the Police 6-1. As the Division A match began, the Navy lost its position and attacked Red Sun. McVittie guided from the middle, dribbling a few steps and then crossing the ball. Armstrong moved forward to meet it and shot with great speed, hoping to succeed at the first attempt. However, Cutler managed to return in time and saved the goal, kicking the ball out of bounds. The Scottish Regiment took the opportunity to launch a major attack, but the two wings failed to coordinate, missing several opportunities. Hodges rarely received support, and his heroism had no place to show. He could only sigh in vain. The maritime bully then launched a comeback, dividing its forces into five groups and penetrating into the opponent's territory. The Scottish Regiment's defense was in frequent danger, and everyone was on edge. Deng Qin, seeing the dangerous situation, bravely left his goal to attack. However, Adamson misunderstood and kicked the ball back to his own territory. Deng Qin was unable to save it, allowing McVittie to take advantage and open the scoring.</p>
<p>The game resumed in the center circle, and the Navy's momentum was strong. The forwards moved all over the field, wreaking havoc in the Scottish Regiment's territory. Deng Qin saved three dangerous shots in a row, but the crisis could not be averted. After a long struggle, ten minutes before the end of the first half, Turban and Armstrong used their heads to score two goals in a row, ending the first half with a score of 3-0. After the break, the game resumed. The Scottish Regiment's forward line showed its weaknesses. Armstrong entered the opponent's territory as if it were no man's land. Fraser was unable to stop his attacks. At this point, the situation became one-sided. McVittie took advantage of a cross and scored the fourth goal. Turban then met a pass in front of the goal and scored again, making it 5-0. McVeigh also showed his strength, breaking through the defense alone. Deng Qin was unable to stop him, and he scored another goal, making it 6-0. The Soviet Scottish Regiment suffered a crushing defeat, losing 6-0. The lineups are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e72">Beware of "National Pickpockets" <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Tie Guang</p>
<p>After the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee concluded, people's trust in the national policy of resistance against Japan and domestic unity has obviously become more firm and solid. People see that the Kuomintang has clearer guidance in military, political, cultural, economic, party affairs, and civil movements. In particular, the establishment and appropriate staffing of the Supreme National Defense Council has fully strengthened people's belief that resistance against Japan will surely succeed and nation-building will surely be accomplished. We have the right to say that the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council is the most dynamic and only leading institution for winning the final victory. We have more reason to say that the existence of the Supreme National Defense Council will, along with the persistence of resistance against Japan, promote the glorious achievements of the national liberation movement. Therefore, from now on, we should execute the various instructions of the Supreme National Defense Council. This is the most correct practice for promoting resistance against Japan and ensuring its victory. We do not need to worry; we only need to enthusiastically believe and manifest it in our actions.</p>
<p>However, we should sternly point out certain spies. For them, the most important and most suspicious matter of the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session is the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council. Their suspicion is actually the suspicion of the "X" people.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the spies, the Supreme National Defense Council is deliberately distorting vision and obliterating the true facts. They stubbornly insist that the Supreme National Defense Council is the establishment of a joint committee between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. They deny the important factor of the coexistence and cooperation of various anti-Japanese parties. This is a slander against various anti-Japanese parties, a most insidious trick of instigation. We should clearly see their true colors.</p>
<p>The spies have always fabricated rumors that the Communist Party is robbing the government. They are indeed quite capable of spreading rumors, but the people and the astute anti-Japanese soldiers have used facts to shatter the tongues of these slaves. Therefore, from the clear meeting of the Fifth Plenary Session to the current establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council, although the slaves are still fabricating rumors that the Communist Party is seizing the National Defense Council and resolutely oppose this supreme power organ that accommodates various anti-Japanese parties, people have deeply understood that this is just the mad barking of slaves who are racking their brains. No one listens to them, and no one believes them. Those who believe them are probably only a few ethnic minorities and those literary men who put on the airs of slave overseers.</p>
<p>Finally, we must solemnly say that the Supreme National Defense Council is the true cooperation of various anti-Japanese parties, the supreme entity for the true establishment of the national united front. This is of course invisible to the spies, because the spies are suffering from blinding eye disease. Our current task is to puncture the malicious rumors of these national pickpockets and expose their crimes nakedly in front of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Eunuch <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Mr. Xiaoyu</p>
<p>I used to raise a cat. Following the suggestion of the old nanny, I neutered it. Sure enough, the animal grew up strong and extraordinary, but there was one shortcoming: after being neutered, it became listless, only knowing how to eat, no longer catching mice at night, and no longer looking for a lover in the spring.</p>
<p>Opening the Shen Bao of January 25th, who knew that the headline that caught my eye on the first page was a Japanese councilor suggesting cutting off bovine glands. It is said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare did not dare to act rashly because the common people opposed this "virtuous" policy, thus arousing severe criticism from two councilors of the Minsei Party, who said they were useless. This eunuch policy is listed on the agenda of the sacred parliament of the Holy East Asian League's Anti-Communist Axis New Order Inventor Count, truly is the pinnacle of civilization today.</p>
<p>I don't know if the two councilor masters are representatives of the common people? Are they turning a blind eye to the "Old Chiefs'" (soldiers too) warmongering, acting against the tide, and constantly using big hats like "Yamato Spirit" and loyalty to the emperor and love for the country to force the common people to prostrate themselves and obediently provide them as cannon fodder to fight Chinese people of the same culture, and still feel that the sacrifice is not thorough enough, wanting to turn the people into a uniform mass of dull-headed eunuch cats.</p>
<p>I thought of a business for the Japanese people, which is to repay them in their own coin. For now, it's better for everyone to rise up and neuter these warlords and politicians who breathe through the same nostrils as the warlords first. Let's see if they will be so ferocious after becoming eunuch cats and eunuchs. Furthermore, it is better to give birth to fewer little demon kings who stir up trouble, boil beans to burn stalks, and half-baked people who act as accomplices for tigers and oppress compatriots.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Process of Bringing Shaw's Play to the Screen <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiafeng</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw is one of the world's most opposed to having his works made into films. Over the years, international film companies from England, America, France, and Germany have tried every means to purchase the film rights to his novels or plays. Every time filmmakers went to ask him, he would cleverly reply: "The film rights to each play sell for one million pounds. Only if you shoot a silent film for the deaf to see will my play be given to you." Or he would say: "The protagonist in my film must be played by Lloyd George (Translator's Note: a contemporary British statesman)."</p>
<p>Every time filmmakers requested permission to film his works, Shaw would always sneer and say: "I am famous enough and do not need any films to increase my glory. I am rich enough and do not need their money. So why should I sell my works to filmmakers? They might ruin them and give me unnecessary trouble!"</p>
<p>One filmmaker after another ran into a wall like this and didn't want to pursue the matter with him anymore. This privilege was later obtained by a relatively unknown filmmaker, while all the famous companies failed. Gabriel Pascal, although a French name, was born in Hungary. He was a news recorder, specification writer, novelist, and filmmaker. He worked in many film companies in Hollywood, London, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, and Budapest for a long time.</p>
<p>Recently, in Paris, without a penny to his name, he suddenly had an idea and wrote a letter to Shaw, whom he had met on the Adriatic Sea two or three years ago, seeking help. The gist of his letter was:</p>
<p>"Sir, perhaps you still remember me, we had a conversation in Italy" twice "actually talked for fifteen minutes," perhaps you also remember, I am now a filmmaker, I have always been interested in your works, I really hope to make one of your plays, especially 'Pygmalion,' into a film, under what conditions would you grant me this privilege? At least, give me one casually."</p>
<p>Strangely, Shaw actually remembered this Hungarian and, contrary to his usual habits, even gave him a reply. This time, he didn't say the same disappointing things as before. He instructed him (Pascal) to find his accountant, "This is a very reasonable person, he is currently traveling in Holland," he told him (the accountant) the mailing address in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>"My only opportunity is to go to Rotterdam myself!" Pascal said to his only friend in Paris, and showed him Shaw's reply. "If you can lend me a thousand francs, I can obtain the film rights to 'Pygmalion' within a week."</p>
<p>That friend lent him a thousand francs, and Pascal ran to Rotterdam to meet the accountant (he was a lawyer from London). After ten negotiations, they still hadn't agreed. What could Pascal do? The lawyer was asking for a high price, requiring payment in installments and demanding all kinds of guarantees, while the money in Pascal's pocket was dwindling day by day. Finally, all his money was used up. Walking along the Rotterdam docks, he inadvertently saw a British cargo ship leaving for London within an hour.</p>
<p>"Where is the captain?" Pascal asked with a spark of inspiration.</p>
<p>"What are you asking for?" A sailor in front of him replied. "He's probably in the pub across the road?"</p>
<p>"Captain," the Hungarian pleaded with the tall, generous man, "Only you can save my life. I will always be grateful to you."</p>
<p>Pascal simply told him his current situation, that he had received Shaw's reply and was unable to reach an agreement with Shaw's accountant.</p>
<p>"If you can get me to London, I will definitely be able to meet Shaw. As long as I see him, all problems can be solved within half an hour."</p>
<p>Thirty hours later, Pascal arrived in London and went to Shaw's house.</p>
<p>"I am Gabriel Pascal," he said. "I have come all the way to ask you to sign this contract yourself, because your accountant, although very good at business, is not on the same wavelength as me. Just think, he dragged out our negotiations for more than ten days, to the point where I couldn't even take out a penny from my pocket. In fact, now I am asking the captain of a cargo ship to bring me to London to see you."</p>
<p>Shaw couldn't help but laugh loudly when he heard these words. The two continued to talk for a while and drank a glass or two of whiskey. Shaw signed "Pygmanon" on the back of Habascal's letter, giving him the film rights.</p>
<p>This film is being shot in London, and a new filmmaker is moving forward on the road to success. 'Translated from MagazineDigest'</p>
<h3 id="e75">Winter Jasmine <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Bu Pai</p>
<p>It's that season,</p>
<p>The four-petaled winter jasmine,</p>
<p>Yellow and bright, blooming on the fence.</p>
<p>The north wind sends the bare-chested boats,</p>
<p>Carrying farmers and their families from the countryside,</p>
<p>They smile, wrinkles appearing at the corners of their eyes.</p>
<p>Buying cloth to make new clothes,</p>
<p>Exchanging rice for pork,</p>
<p>And New Year incense for the gods.</p>
<p>But this story is too old,</p>
<p>Today they are captured by "X" troops,</p>
<p>Driven to the front line to supplement the Imperial Army's shortage.</p>
<p>Disobedience is "Communist,"</p>
<p>Machine guns are mounted on their backs,</p>
<p>"Civilization" is interpreted as "arbitrary killing."</p>
<p>It's that season,</p>
<p>But the four-petaled winter jasmine</p>
<p>No longer blooms on the fence.</p>

<p>Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard</p>
<p>(1) Embarking on a Two Thousand Eight Hundred Li Journey</p>
<p>It was the season of late autumn, with the autumn wind blowing and the leaves of the Chinese tallow trees falling to the ground. In the large square of Pui Ying Middle School in Fangcun, Guangzhou, hundreds of youths with boiling blood were gathered, and a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere filled the originally desolate square. This was a general meeting where all comrades resisting Japan were gathered, discussing the departure marching route and formation.</p>
<p>On the evil evening of October, more than seventy warriors in different clothes, carrying bundles on their backs, calmly and quickly passed through the streets of Guangzhou like snakes and crossed the river. Arriving at the Shiwetang military station, we began our one thousand eight hundred li journey.</p>
<p>It was midnight, the sky as black as ink, with only a few sparse stars twinkling. Shiwetang Station was crowded with countless refugees. Suddenly, the wailing air raid siren sounded, the lights went out, and all activity ceased. We had to scatter around the station. Only when dawn was about to break did the alarm end. The main force groped forward along the railway. After dawn, the sound of exploding bombs followed behind us. Looking back, under the distant Baiyun Mountain, white smoke was constantly rising. Destruction, Guangzhou was destroyed. A heavy, almost unbearable weight pressed on our hearts. Everyone continued to move forward with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Foshan was the same, tense and chaotic, with the people busy evacuating. After a day and night of walking, fatigue invaded every comrade's body, and everyone fell asleep. In the middle of the night, just as people were sleeping soundly, the assembly whistle rang. With sleepy and blurry postures, we returned to the team. The captain said in a hoarse voice: "Comrades - everyone is tired, but this little bit of hardship is nothing to the Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades. For the sake of the country, for the sake of the nation, we should endure all hardships. The Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades are not afraid of hardship. Everyone, bring out the vanguard spirit!" These words struck the comrades' ears like a shot of morphine. At the same time, the captain announced that we were on a forced march and should especially strengthen vigilance at night.</p>
<p>From the southwest to the Pearl River Estuary, we traveled by water. After much negotiation, we found a sailboat that crammed in more than seventy people, plus the original passengers. Therefore, every corner of the boat, the sides, the top, was crowded with people. The boat was too full and moved as sluggishly as a camel. In order to advance quickly and reduce the hardship of the boatmen, we launched a cable-pulling team. Undoubtedly, every comrade fully demonstrated the vanguard spirit. Those who volunteered were eager to be first. So we divided into groups and took turns helping the boatmen pull the cable. Singing boatmen's songs, but with lively postures, we quickly dragged the boat forward. Therefore, we were able to quickly slip past Southwest, Sanshui, Lanbao, Qingyuan, and to the Pearl River Estuary.</p>
<p>At the Pearl River Estuary, only a few railway ties remained, twisted and powerless, supporting it. Under the bridge, charred pieces of wood flowed continuously. In order to stop the enemy's advance, our side did not hesitate to sacrifice many great people's buildings. According to intelligence, the "X" people were only seventy or eighty li away from here. We estimated the "X" people's line of attack and decided to pass this danger line and take the road north.</p>
<p>Learning, learning, and learning again, this was the central slogan of self-education in the team. On the water, there was no work to do, so time was spent on theoretical learning, seizing time to read necessary books, and enthusiastically discussing various issues related to the resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>From the Pearl River Estuary, the main force advanced along the Guangdong-Han Railway. The stations along the way were burned down, and piles of railway sleepers were stacked next to the stations, burning fiercely. This was our expression of unwillingness to supply the enemy. Everything was burned down for the "X" people. When will we be able to rebuild this broken country? This only requires us to work hard!</p>
<p>Although it was a forced march, we never neglected our work for a moment. At a small hill in Dakengkou, the forest was so dense that it covered the place like a curtain. We were stationed here and encountered a team of new recruits from the 29th Army. This team of new recruits, who were originally demoralized and filled with homesickness, was driven away by the speeches and singing at our farewell rally, which dispelled their fatigue and reorganized their homesickness. In particular, the little ghosts in the team made them feel that going to the front line and fighting the "X" people was a glorious duty and a sacred right!</p>
<p>Little Ghost Shi was a female comrade who was only thirteen years old. She followed her brother to participate in the Anti-Japanese Vanguard, carrying a burden on her back; she blended into the main force and followed the main force with big steps. When we couldn't find a house on the mountain road and couldn't get a decent meal for sixty or seventy li, she couldn't reduce her excitement. Not only did she not need the busywork of the big ghosts, but she also often aroused the motivation of the big ghosts.</p>
<p>(2) Hitting the "X" People's Rear</p>
<p>The main force arrived in Wengyuan. The people's spirit here was particularly closed and dull. The people simply did not know what resistance against Japan meant. Most pitifully, some picked up leaflets dropped by the "X" people from airplanes and even took them home to frame them on the wall as decorations.</p>
