<h3>外匯平準下之暗市匯價</h3>
<p>— 章榴</p>
<p>章榴先生係某經濟學家之筆名，以熟悉金融市况受人器重，該文係對今後外匯暗市之一種有力之推測，關心本問題者希注意之　編者</p>
<p>一　外匯平準基金與暗市</p>
<p>外匯平準基金委員會是在香港成立了，所謂平準基金，當然是平準法幣的匯價，但現在中國實際上已有兩個匯價，一是中央銀行掛牌的官價，一是暗市中的私價，那末，今後外匯平準基金實施平準的匯價，是官價呢私價呢？</p>
<p>從下面的理由上，我們假定今後實施平準的匯價，是私價，而不是官價。下因為</p>
<p>第一，中央銀行的匯價至今極穩定，照原牌毫無變更，根本就用不着平準。况在幣制革以來，政府在倫敦紐約，即有平準基金的專欵，暗市發生後，中國銀行又出而調整，（見宋子文氏談話）就當時的暗市匯價與後來匯價比較，可見中國外匯平準基金有盈無虧。也就是說中國的外匯基金，在戰後雖或沒有增加，但决不至受有損失，這樣自無補充外匯基金的必要，此次設置的基金，自然供平準晤市之用</p>
<p>第二，這是以暗市匯價存在而定。因爲暗市如果不存在，那未匯價只有一個，自然毋須問他是平準那一個了。從實際上言，假定英美銀行有決心，肯幇中國國家銀行的忙，共同來消滅暗市。似乎並非沒有可能。但是在現在市勢中，他們旣以八辦士可易得中國價値一元之商品，爲什麼一定要做一先令二辦士半的官價來交換的笨伯呢？</p>
<p>第三，設置外匯基金時倫敦方面發表談話，認為對英國商業有利。而目前的各國貿易，差不多集中於暗市，是以所謂有利當然也指暗市。就委員銀行的地位說：匯豐麥加利是商業銀行，中交兩行雖與中央同以國家銀行系統見稱，在商業銀行中也佔重要地位，如果是平準官價，就不應沒有中央銀行在內。再次，就成立的地點說，如果他是中國的外匯機關，總樞紐應設在重慶，香港應為辦事處，而此次外匯平準基金委員會，明明係倫敦發源，而置重心於香港，所以其平準目標也必在於穩定暗市，而便利中英貿易無疑，</p>
<p>二　九辦士乎辦士乎</p>
<p>從有外匯暗市以來，市價大致一往直下，從最初的一先令二辦士半，降到最近的八辦士二五左右，其間却有一個特點，卽最近三個月，市價特別顯示穩定，其穩定之趨勢，就經騐中觀察（一）邁有大量放出時，麥加利，匯豐兩行，常為吸收人，（二）遇頭寸非常緊凑時，麥加利匯豐兩行常為供給人，（二）市價伸出八辦土二五以後，不久必重新回復到八辨士二五；而市價縮入八辦士二五，不久也必平衡在八辦士二五之上，從（一二）兩點來說，顯然匯豐麥加利兩行實際上已在負平凖匯市的作，從（三）點說，則顯然外匯暗市中的標準已安定在八辦士二五之上。</p>
<p>等到外匯基金的消息傳出後，才知道麥加利匯豐兩銀行原是外匯平準基金委目會中之負責份子，則今後之暗市平衡標準究將如何？</p>
<p>（一）說是抬到九辦士，理由是八辦士半或八辨士二五的匯價，跟法定官價相去過遠，上海洋商進出口商行，據傳曾要求以九辨士給予外匯。八辨士二五之水凖，安定業有數月，如果　然長放，必立即予金融市場以收縮作用。所以就現率出發，把匯價抬到九辨士最有可能。</p>
<p>（二）也有一說，以為匯市不會動，將永遠安定在現價八辨士二五之上。理由以為現價，業已安定數月之久，因匯價貶低所受之刺激，反予上海以提高物價的利益，發生了特殊景氣。各國如要支持貿易，就必須維持此種景氣存在，也就是必須維持低匯價的水準。</p>
<p>（三）更有一說，以為外匯暗市在今後將無水準的上下，外匯委會之任務，固在安定外匯暗市，却不是供給外匯暗市。所以外匯委會對今後英國商人能以九辦士的市價　得外匯，至其他商人，則置之不理。同時，對於暗市的外匯買賣，仍用「頭寸多時儘量吸入，頭寸少時以一定限度拋出」的方法來安定匯市。</p>
<p>上面三說，都有若干理由，也都有若干可能性。最近市勢還看不出，當局究將採取何　辦法，不過有幾點可以光先下來：第一，外匯暗市再縮下去大致是不可能的。第二外匯基金委員會必將直接參加外匯暗市。或者用某種標準，却不一定維持某種標準。</p>
<p>三　暗市與官價之將來</p>
<p>早有人主張將官價貶低，換言之，是將官價撤消，而俯就暗市，這種主張固沒有實現，且不曾實現，實現起來，在中國必有害而無利，如果將官價取消，無異在說明政府已沒有維持原匯價的誠意，同時，暗市中非正式的匯價，因取消了官價，無形中予以合法的承認，所以事實上决不曾實行的。</p>
<p>最後，就外匯平衡基金的本質來說，外匯平衡會維持暗價可取之處便極少。因爲外匯暗市之發生，由於中國管理外匯。如果使暗市能够予取予求，則何必在戰時管理外匯呢？</p>
<p>但轉過來說，對中國究竟是有利的。外匯平衡基金的增厚，是表示中國貨幣基礎日益鞏固；同時，該項委員會旣由中英專家負責處理其事，當然不會給第三國利用。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從四月九日至四月十五日</p>
<p>一九三九年是暴風雨的年代，一九三九年的四月，更是暴風雨的月份，狂風，驟雨，怒雷，急電，再加上空前未見的黑暗與腥臭</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞又繼告淪亡了，犧牲在意大利的瘋狂侵略和英法的不千涉政策下面了！阿國淪亡以後，巴爾幹諸國固然是唇亡齒寒，全歐洲以至拉丁美洲亦不能再幻想無抵抗的和平了。然而英法美各國所採取的反侵略的步驟，是否已能制止擴大中的世界危機呢？</p>
<p>東方侵略者在歐局危急之際，趕緊召開一次重臣會議，一方面固然將加緊其對華進攻的步驟，另一方面却想對英法各國實施其『趁火打劫』的故技！中國的抗戰在本週已有更重大的發展，然而英法各國對遠東危機，又將取什麼對策呢？</p>
<p>（一）阿爾巴亞淪亡　世界危機益緊迫</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞，在意大利大舉進攻之下，終以寡不敵衆而淪亡了。意軍於七日登陸，八日開入阿京梯倫那，九日己着手組織傀區政權。至此歐洲又少一獨立的小國，而侵略者則又完成了改造世界地圖的一部份計劃。</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞以國小人少，軍事力量又極為不尼興窳陋，但猶能堅决抵抗强大敵軍的海空軍大舉猛攻，在拉素港等處會一再擊退敵軍，而阿國獵戶及各界民衆，亦踴躍參加抗戰，阿國兩王子迄今尙在領導武裝反侵略鬥爭。這種民埃精神，實可保證其未來復國的可能，我們應該寄與無限的同情與祝意。</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞淪亡之後，南斯拉夫與希臘固然直接受到威脅，整個巴爾幹亦為之震動。且因意德侵略者的勾結，更加重了對於波蘭，羅馬尼亞以至整個歐洲的威脅。反之，在侵略者方面，意大利佔得阿國後，在海上已可完全獨佔亞得里亞海，阻斷南斯拉夫和英法的海上連絡，增强其在東地中海的地位；在陸上則已獲得侵略巴爾幹諸國的據點據點，而配合德國將來在東南歐的軍事行動。德意在西班牙勢力日增，已有統轄西地中海之勢；今意大利又佔阿國，更可完成德意在東地中海建立優勢的計劃了。</p>
<p>德意第二步驟已在開始了！九日莫斯科悄息報羅馬記者報告：意軍卽將佔據南希邊界及海岸，俾展開對英法屬地更廣大的進攻。十日倫敦泰晤士報羅馬通訊報告：德意企圖奪取愛零海，再進一步迫羅國割讓黑海口岸。十三日巴黎晚報和倫敦每日晚報並報告：意國凖備與南保密約，瓜分巴爾幹，並圖組織馬其頓獨立國。美國政界更指出：德意目的不僅在囊括巴爾幹，且圖於反侵略集團充實陣容之後，賡續舉行，以試探英法有無抵抗决心。柏林方面也已露出德意進一步侵略計劃：將控制一切小國，平分中歐，如迫使波蘭加入軸心，羅匈兩國由德控制等。德意由於內部危機，急取軍事投機冒險，以進攻小國為進攻英法的第一步驟，實際上世界大戰已達到更嚴重的階段了。</p>
<p>（二）小國驚惶亂動　英法再發宣言</p>
<p>法西斯侵略者推進世界大戰的瘋狂冒險旣如上述，民主和平各國又有什麼表示呢？</p>
<p>第一，已成直接併吞目標的一切小國，目前雖已有『驚惶亂飛』的現象，但大都不願屈辱降×，準備聯合抵抗。希臘，南斯拉夫，瑞士，荷蘭等，均已實施局部動員，準備應付非常事變。近東回敎國家及全世界囘敎徒，反侵略情緒　為高漲，土耳其，叙利亞及巴勒斯坦以至北菲各地，一週來均有熱烈的反意示威運動。羅馬尼亞與土耳其談話，十日結束，己經同意合力保持兩國安全獨立。羅南兩國日內亦有重要會談。不過如果英法再不積極團結這些小國，建立集體安全政策，堅决反抗侵略，則各小國仍不免慘遭各個擊破，進而及於英法本身！</p>
<p>第二，英法兩國，亦已被迫採取反抗侵略的各種步驟，英首相張伯倫與法總理達拉第，于十三日同時分別發表宣言，申述兩國對目前歐局的立場。張伯倫宣言要點是：（一）英帝國决以最大努力，防止一切藉威脅或武力以圖擾亂地中海或巴爾幹半島現狀之所為；（二）保證希臘及羅馬尼亞之獨立，（三）不發止英意協定，（四）與蘇俄仍有聯絡；（五）號召和平國家團結一致抵抗侵略。達拉第宣言大致相同，要點是‘（一）法政府巳採軍事措置以保衛國土；（二）與吳美蘇波土羅南希等國保持接觸維護和平；（三）保證羅馬尼亞及希臘完整；（四）法波根據同盟條約實行互助。英法此種宣言，自有極其重要的意義，特別是敢於公開宣稱决心聯合蘇聯等和平國家抵抗侵略者一點。但是要求眞正發生制止侵略的效力，則尙有賴於眞正實行集體安全政策，切實聯台蘇聯及美國，團結一切小國，制裁侵略國家，爭取長時間的整體的和平。英國兩院議員已一致要求英蘇切實合作，法國人民亦同樣熱烈的要求着。</p>
<p>（三）美蘇密切合作　和平陣綫強化</p>
<p>美國和蘇聯的反侵略運動，最近又有新的進展。美總統羅斯福在十一日的『華盛頓郵報』發表一篇重要談話，警告侵略國家，他說：『極權國家倘眞造成戰爭時，其動手之初，卽有一個國家，比德意兩國合成之力量尤見偉大者，將被牽涉在內。』美國各報，亦一致指稱羅氏此文表示：『大戰果爆發，美國不能熟視無覩。』美國謹員亦一致擁護，認為』正確表明美國政府人民對料局的態度。』十四日美國務卿赫爾更向全世界廣播，强調聲明美國全民族有决心有勇氣以抵抗侵略國家。而近日政界及人民援華制日運動，情緒尤為高漲，民主黨議員伏希士，前共和黨衆院議長鐵爾遜等，均有重要建議，並且獲得贊成。</p>
<p>至於美國對蘇聯和蘇聯對中國的友誼，最近更有重大進步。蘇聯的海軍調查團已到美京，進行蘇美兩國海軍合作的重要會談。美國商部並以對蘇貿易數字證明蘇聯工業的綿密化及國防工業的加强。同時美國外交覜察冢還一致指稱：蘇聯遠東政策確將確切强化，援華工作亦將加緊。原因是：（一）蘇聯現在已經完成肅黨肅軍工作，戰時可無內顧之憂；（二）蘇聯國防程序的效率，已超過一般的期望；（三）蘇聯策略家深信：同時防衛東西兩國境，可以獲得成功。此外，十二日美聯社華盛頓電並曾報告蘇聯發言人最近談話，稱：『蘇聯必須並具已經在歐亞兩方面，同時凖備自衛；因為軸心國家，詭計多端，勢必東西呼應。』</p>
<p>美蘇兩國，堅决反抗侵略者前决心，勇氣與力量，美蘇及中蘇友誼關係的進步，必將提高全世界和平正義人士的鬥爭情緒。卽英法兩國，對於蘇聯，亦巳為時勢所迫，不得不重視其保銜和平的力量，而不斷的進行各種關係問題的談判。英法有識之士，亦紛促政府聯合蘇聯，擴大和平陣綫：自由黨領袖勞合喬治，旣於十二日演說，力促張伯倫從速與蘇聯成立切實的軍事合作；英工黨領袖阿特里，保守黨領袖邱吉爾，自由黨領袖辛克萊，工黨議員達爾頓，以至中耐爾貴族，及雜零安候爵等，亦分在衆貴兩院敦促政府與蘇聯締結同盟，以為建立反侵略集團的保證。</p>
<p>至於遠東方面，新加坡總督於二月間遊歷安南暹羅時，會建議馬來亞新加坡安南緬甸暹羅等，合締不侵犯公約，以擊破日×的挑撥，最近盛傳巳獲『良好的反向』。我們希望英法美各國認淸日×侵華及最近强佔海南島新南羣島等暴行對於各國的嚴重威脅，如在歐洲為各方所要求一樣，而迅速聯合中國與蘇聯，團結一切小國及被壓迫民族，一致抵抗侵略者。</p>
<p>（四）全面反攻展開　抗戰形勢樂觀</p>
<p>國際上民主和平國家與法西斯侵略者的兩條陣綫的　爭，已經史强烈地展開了。我們為保衛民族獨立自由並保衛世界和平而鬥爭的抗日義戰，亦已有更猛烈的開展。</p>
<p>先看×情，誠如紐約民聲報十一日社評根據軍略家觀察所稱『日軍困難日增，華軍反攻得勢，故日軍對華冒險行動，將人緊急關頭。』廣漢陷落以來，日×兵力不足與分散的困難日益發展，直至南昌陷落，消耗戰鬥力尤為重大，又加軍事困難及國內與台灣朝鮮東北等地仍需大量兵力，新兵補充亦大感困難　，近來雖圖實行投機冒險，但是實際力量則極有限。因此目前日×整個軍事策略是：（一）加緊强化佔領區為主，（二）密切配合『和平』『反共』運動；（三）利用反共和平烟幕實行軍事的投機冒險。至於目前戰略則是（一）加緊打通平漢粵漢兩路，强化東部中國的佔領，（二）實施對西北西南的軍事投機，反共和平陰謀如有進展，立卽大舉侵犯。</p>
<p>我們為要粉碎×人這種新的策略，一面要　底打擊×奸反共和平的政治陰謀。一面要加緊增强各路前綫的戰鬥力和廣泛發動×後的游擊戰。</p>
<p>就軍事發展情形說，我們在本週內北自綏察前綫，南至南海之濱，巳開始全綫總反攻的軍事。最値得重視的是：（一）華北方面，傳作義部進駐綏西，綏省軍政頓呈活躍；偽蒙騎兵兩師相繼反正，寨上軍民抗戰熱潮澎湃。山西×軍七次進犯中條山，但七次均遭擊破，現芮城陌南均已收復，重要據點悉入我手。晉西及晉西北我軍亦先後發動反攻，甚為得手。冀魯各地游擊戰現亦繼續進展　。（二）東北方面，第八路軍部隊深入關外，與各地抗日聯軍取得聯絡；日前北甯路錦州皇姑屯站都有風聲鶴唳之慨。東北四省現已劃歸第×戰區，委××為司令長官，而晉翼綏一帶游擊隊，均已奉令出關，發動大規模的反攻（三）隴海線方面，第八路軍和于學忠孫殿英孫桐萱等部，由東西兩端分向徐州及開封進攻。開封當卽被我於十一日衝入，十二十三兩日，尙在巷戰；偽靖綏委員六人被殺，×偽軍損失重大，外國軍事觀察家亦認為『華軍對日軍佔領重要城市第一次的有效的攻擊。』同時第八路軍一部約二千人，則又於十二日在台兒莊東北大獲勝利，反攻徐州及魯豫蘇邊區軍事，卽將有新的進展。（四）鄂豫兩省反攻軍事，本週亦有相當成功，鐘祥一帶×軍正受圍殲，信陽等地之×亦遭我軍圍攻，損失重大。（五）裏戰場方面，蘇北我軍乘勝進取沐陽，包圍淮陰，皖境我軍進攻合肥一帶，×軍受創甚重，偽軍路家雲部千餘人並於九日全部反正。蘇浙皖贛邊我軍亦已分路實行大反攻。而南京近郊亦巳再度遭遇我新四軍的攻擊。（六）華南方面我軍一部雨克佛山，一部北克花縣，一部東克增城，現己協同進迫廣州。</p>
<p>由於各戰場反攻的開展，全面戰局巳經激劇轉趨優勢，配合着政治上全國將領全國民衆和政府當局嚴懲通×　汪精衛。澈底打擊『反共和平』陰謀，我們抗戰建國事業的前途，是更加光明更可樂觀了！不過在目前，無論在政治上在軍事上在外交上，我們所有的成就，還沒有達到足以予×以致命打擊的程度；×國內部×軍內部的危機以全×人在國外一切活動所受困難，亦未發展到無力發動冒險進攻的程度，而叛國通×份子且在加緊其反共和平陰謀，以為日×服務而危害我國家民族！因此城們還必須加緊策國內的團結，軍事和政治上的進步，民族自尊心自信心的提高，實現全國人民一切力量的總動員，配合國際反侵略的和平陣綫的發展，予×奸以澈底的打擊。只有在更艱苦的戰鬥中，才有我們的勝利的和平！</p>
<h3>新四军一年来　抗戰經騐與教訓（二）</h3>
<p>— 項英</p>
<p>根據一年來的作戰，×人的優點與弱點可分下列幾點：第一，×人的戰術，一，×人的戰術是依靠到處構築據點，修築公路，縮小我們的活動的範圍。二，分進合擊，採取襲擊包圍。三，輕裝掩進，便於迅速動作，突然襲擊。四，採用　擊，利用道路伏擊我部隊。五，採取隱蔽的行動，白天容易發覺，夜間行動，使我警戒疏忽，部隊打受易擊。它走小路，不走太路。六，依靠火力，用火力威脅×人，壓制×人，第二，×人的優點。一，射擊準確。二，善於利用地形，地物，隱蔽前進。三，會游泳，四，傷病兵的救護迅速，軍火的收拾機敏。五，頑强性由於武士道的敎育，軍閥的武斷，欺騙，宣傳養成了×軍戰鬥的頑强性，以前寗可打死，不願繳槍，現在程度降低了，不如以前那般頑强。六，　種動作合於戰術。合於戰鬥的要求。七，幹部很強，能掌握部隊，遇戰鬥展開很快。八，士兵服從性强，說進就進，說退就退，打敗了能集台。九，對於交通修復力很强。十　戰術運用派靈活，隨時的變動，今天失敗，明夭就改了。第三　對付我們的計策：一，所有重要交通綫，以及公路轉國沬角處，都構築工事做據點。二，做鐵絲綱，用警犬，小河用活動橋　。四，行軍或運輸，用小兵力先佔據顯要地位，掩蔽前進，搜索前進。五，宿營地點常常變動。六，住的房子挖戰壕槍洞。七，利用河道運輸，防我襲擊。第四，敵人的弱點，一，輕敵心仍然存在，警戒疏忽。二，缺乏攻擊精神。三，動作呆笨遲鈍。三，不能勞耐，不能長途行軍。急行軍，强行軍。五，利用漢奸失的敗。與偽軍的無用，和不可靠。</p>
<p>民運工作的　經騐與教訓</p>
<p>我們在這一年來，在前方在後方，為了動員民衆，加强抗戰的力量，為了達到軍民的合作，以及在民衆的擁護與帮助之下，能够在江南困難的環境下面，來堅持鬥爭，所以自從本軍成立以來，隨時隨地的進行民衆運動，雖然我們因為各種客觀條件，使我們在某一個時候，某一個階段中間，不能依照我們自己的願望，進行民衆工作，甚至不能做民衆工作，臂如本軍成立開始，由改編到集中，特別是在集中這一階段，我們為了遵守上級的命令，為了免除許多誤會，這個時間，何以說是沒有做民衆工作，直到我們部隊展開惟後，進行作戰時，才在我們自巳作戰的區域，我們自已軍隊的周圍，開始進行民斚工作，我們以前的宣傳工作，是，得很少，在這時間才開始進行，不僅宣傳，並且由宣傳進到組織，可是直到今天，還有一部份人不了解民衆工作的重要，還不了解如何達到軍民的合作，這樣不僅不能開展表面的民衆運動，達到救亡運動的開展，甚至於不願有民衆運動，和妒嫉人家作民衆運動。我們為什麼要做民運工作呢？為了抗戰，為了可以戰勝×人，消滅×人，爭取抗戰的勝利，站在軍隊的本身說，為了軍隊的生存，沒有民衆，軍隊不能開展，不能生長，要打敗仗，尤其其在中日戰爭條件對比之下，我們的武器比較×人差得多，拿我們新四軍來講，比一般抗戰的軍隊武器還要差，我們拿這樣劣等的武噐，對抗優等的×人，主要依靠民衆的力量，和帮助，如果沒有民衆，那末我們不但不能够抵抗×人，並且不能取得優劣懸殊情况下的作戰的勝利，這說明我們為　麼要作民衆工作，為什麼我們這個工作和我們的生存與勝利，看得這樣重要，因為這是不可分離的。半年多以來我們的民衆運動，可以分為三個部份來講：</p>
<p>一，半年來的經騐與敎訓：A第一個經騐，也可說是一個敎訓，軍隊的本身的實際行動，它是得到民衆信仰與擁護的，基本條件，它是開始民運工作的基礎，我記得當本軍從南昌出發的時候，我曾經向服務團同志作一個關於戰區民運工作的報告，我曾經指出第一以軍隊的本身行動作民衆運動的基礎，因為我們是軍隊做民運工作，首光就要自己的紀律嚴明。才能取得民衆的信仰，我們想我們這一年，尤其是下半年來。更可證明這一點，　如說，在上半年本軍集中後，向戰區開進的時候，我們沒有作宣傳工作，工作開始還是服務　同志到了戰爭環境展開以後，但為什麼到處的許多民衆，他們對我們歡迎，信仰，許多民衆對我們幇助，使本軍在皖南民衆中間，得到極好極好的信仰，因為我們軍隊有極好的紀律，不但紀律好，而且至處　護民衆，到處尊重民衆的利益，因此雖然我們沒有許多宜傳，而我們到處受歡迎，當我們軍隊開　到江南作戰地區的時候，因為日本軍隊的宣傳及過去國內戰爭時的宣傳，許多人對我們不了解，但我們的先遺隊去了一轉，馬上江南民衆對我們認識了，等到主力開進的時候，民衆到處歡迎我們，這些事實證明了這一眞理，軍隊紀律是民運工作的基礎，同樣的反過來證明那一個軍隊紀律不好，雖然做了許多宜傳，老百姓仍然不相信，許多人以為我們不知道化了多少錢作宣傳工作，眞正的宣傳工作我們覺得慚愧得很，正為我們軍隊的行動才能取得民衆的信仰，這樣再去做民運工作，就便利得多了。B第二，作戰的勝利是開展民運工作必要的條件，單憑作宣傳不去打仗，或打仗不好，老百姓說『好是好的呀，沒有用呀！』簡單一句話，我們所以由江南取得廣大民衆的擁護，很快的開展民運工作，和我們在江南的勝利有很大的關係，這是第二個經驗與敎訓，C第三，統一戰綫是進行民蓮工作的前提，我在上一次報告中特別指出一切經過統一戰綫，在統一戰綫基楚上，才能使民衆動員起來。今天我們也可證明那一個統一戰綫運用的好，就能大大的開展工作，那個地方差一點，工作也就差一點。D深入民衆，為動員民衆和組織民衆有效方法，要去組織，動員單靠宣傳不行，標語也不行，這些作用是很有限度的，一定要到民衆裏面去，才能了解民衆，才能接近民衆，才能在這個基礎上把他們組織起來，動員起來。一味站在民衆上面，想做民衆工作那是空的，這一個可以拿我們的經驗來看，前後方那些地方，沒有深入到民衆中去，工作就還不够，羣衆的動員就做不通，這是第四個經驗與教訓。E第五，要注意民衆的生活，這是動員民衆抗戰的主要條件，也可以說是必要的因素，要使廣大的民衆參加到抗戰中來，必須注意他們的生活問題，不想法子去解决他們的生活問題，那麼就不能將他們的熱情提高，因為這是他們切身感覺的，我們拿經驗來看，那個地方注意了這個問題，並給以相當的解决，那個地方的抗戰情緒就不同，那個地方沒有顧到這個問題，民衆運動就差多了，不僅在前方，在後方也是一樣的，但我們有一個原則，在抗戰最高原則下面，來進行解决民生問題，為抗戰來發動民衆來達到使他們參加抗戰，站在抗戰利益下去解决民生痛苦，這是一個原則，這也是我們半年多以來民運工作第五個經騐與敎訓。F無論任何民衆運動從開始發動繼續發展深入，民衆組織的鞏固，如果不能在當地民衆中間提拔許多幹部，培養幹部領導工作，這一民衆運動就不能開展，民衆組織，就不鞏固，只有提拔和培養了當地民衆中間的幹部，使這些幹部去鞏固和堅强民衆組織，沒有這些骨幹是不成的，那地方有相當地幹部，有自己本身幹部工作，民衆運動一定好，那個地方經常請別人替他辦理是沒有大效果的，這是明顯的事實。G第七就是我們在方法上的一個經騐與敎訓，關於戲劇與化裝講演，這是農村宣傳最有效的方法，假若我們有很好的適台農村的戲劇，來提高他捫戰大的意識，比我們講很　的報告效用還抗，一般的民衆沒有進到學校，所以要注意我們了解的程度，採取各種各樣的方法如果像我們今天的報告，農民一聽，腦子就昏了，我們說在鬥爭以來經騐的方式，在農村中那些是有效的，可以說演講標語都沒有多大的效果，甚至於有藝術的圖畫也沒有十分作用，如果是化裝演講，演戲那就不同了。H第八，民運工作與民衆的動員，我們來分析ｇ　下，那些地方有民運工作，民衆的動員就容易；那些地方就可以適應抗戰的需要，减少動員的困難，凡有民衆組織的地方，動員就更快，沒有組織的羣衆，則政治認識不够，動員力量是小的，總之，　就是抗戰中很大的弱點，為什麼民衆動員不起來呢？就是，有組織，所以我們要做民運工作，要組織民衆，要依靠民衆組織才可以適合抗戰的要求。（未完）</p>

<h3>關南游擊軍印象記（上）</h3>
<p>（晋西北通訊）我跑到前方、聽見當地老百姓說了許多關南游擊軍的話，這些話當然是好壞兩方面的。有的說這一部分軍隊對待老百姓不客氣，有的說這一部分軍隊常打日本××，並且還獲得多次的勝利。　縣動委會的一位同志，對我講述國這樣一段故事：</p>
<p>『九月十八的那一天，杜司令忽然問了聲幹部們…『今天是什麼日子？』接着他就下了個命令，親身帶了二部隊伍，到同蒲路附近襲擊×人。襲擊歸來，集合起隊伍訓話，大意說…『我們用戰鬥來紀念九一八呢！』</p>
<p>聽到各方面的話，對于關南游擊軍，腦海裏凑成這樣一個猜想…『杜司令也許是位行伍出身的英雄？軍紀方面有點犯極端民主的毛病？』</p>
<p>去年十二月四日，天氣是那樣明朗，我們還吊着忻口大戰過後的戰場，走到了××村。這裏是最前綫了，時刻有和×人接觸的可能，所以山頭的哨兵，戒備甚嚴。當我們定進村口，哨兵很嚴密的向我們盤查了一番。</p>
<p>我們蒙司令部的招待，住在附近一二里的一個村子裏，隨卽由兩位負責同志去謁見杜司令，接洽慰勞的事情，結果約定在下午四點鐘笨行慰勞一，我們這一趟出來慰勞，每到一處，總不能依預定的時間完成工作。這一天很痛快的當天就能完成任務，同志們的心裏是非常高興的，可是時問到了，不見杜司令到來，我們好幾次跑到村口去張望，都不見一絲動靜。我們正在急躁中，高參謀處長相隨着周支隊長和兩位政治工作人員來了。</p>
<p>高參謀長是位善於辭令的人物，談鋒甚健，說起話來，好像運珠砲的。我們中間除了一兩個負責同志述明我們的來意外，其餘的人都是默然傾聽。他首先說明了杜司令今天不能來的緣故，是因為軍書勞午，抽不出空閒來。慰勞的事情，改在明天舉行。接着他就介紹了關南游擊軍的來歷，並且談了許多實際的問題。</p>
<p>聽了高處長的說話，知道這一部份軍隊是在戰鬥中生長起來的，而現在已經成長得强壯起來了。在不斷的戰鬥中，給了×人很大的打擊，如閻莊衛村的戰鬥，獲得了大的勝利，得到了民衆的擁護，鼓動了戰士們的殺×情緒。杜司令不如我猜想的那樣，相反的是一位文縐縐的「儒將』，曾在美國留學多年，為了痛心于半壁河山的淪陷，所以拋棄了優裕的生活，跑到最前綫和×日作殊死的搏鬥。在好幾次的戰鬥中，×人的炮打到了他的附近。而軍紀方面也特別嚴峻，遠反民衆利益或逃跑的士兵都要槍决。高處長特別指出以前和各方面不諒解的地方，是因為沒有政訓處。他褒到這一點時，忘形的瞟了那兩位相隨而來的政工人員，興高彩烈的說：</p>
<p>『現在好了　我們的政訓處成立了，從此可以和民衆榕頭了！』</p>
<p>次日太陽剛出山，杜司令來了，中個子的身材，着一身粗布灰色軍衣，態度很和　，不帶一點官僚習氣，沉着少言和我們作了一番介紹，就引我們去慰勞軍隊。</p>
<p>隊伍集合在村外的一片廣場上，映在我們眼帘裏的是陣容的嚴整，武噐的齊全，精神的振奮。他們唱着雄壯的歌曲，歡迎着我們。</p>
<p>我們向他們講述來意熱致慰問後，接着又把一桿上面寫着「民族英雄』四個字的靑天白日旗，敬獻杜司令。國旗在杜司令手裏把着，隨着微風飄揚，保衛祖國的戰士們，朝若行了一個禮，接着杜司令訓話了。他說：「這是中華民國的國旗，大家嬰敬重！大家答覆慰勞團的盛意，要把中華民國的國旗揷遍了全中國！收復失地，把日本××趕出去！」講演完畢，他沉着的向戰士們道：『是我們怕×子，還是×子怕我們？』</p>
<p>『×子怕我們！』是一聲堅决而宏大的囘答。</p>
<p>最後，杜司令領導着戰士們唱歌，領導着戰士們呼口號：『戰到最後一憫人』！『戰到最後一條槍』！堅决的吼聲，在山野裏激蕩着。</p>
<p>慰勞完了，杜司令又相隨到我們的住處，和我們懇談着，我們一面吃着早飯，一面聽他談話，他給我們不憚煩的講述戰鬥，介紹他的身世，他說：他很願意和學生派的人在一塊兒』臨別，流露出戀戀之意。</p>
<p>經過這一次的慰勞，關　游擊軍在我腦海里留下了一個深的印象像杜司令的環境，很有可能住在一堪察加一過着洋樓汽車的生活。然而他，他愛過戰鬥的生活！他愛要祖國的目由！（未完）</p>

<h3>廣東的新省會　曲江新姿態</h3>
<p>— 湯士</p>
<p>【本報特稿】隨着軍事需要的轉移，粵省都會從廣州移到連縣，又從連縣移到曲江了。目前曲江已成為粵省政治中心。最近各救亡團體又泰半集中到這裏來，從前這裏只是粵漢路上交通的要點，救運還比較冷落，可是現在已表現出蓬勃活躍的景象</p>
<p>雖然×人殘酷地將這裏大部份繁盛的地區——風度南路之至風烈路到曲江橋一帶商店民房炸成一片瓦礫之場，可是其他未遭毒手之地區，依然照常營業，而一羣羣一隊隊的靑年夥子的雄壯隊伍，不時在市街上經過，整齊的步伐，洪亮的歌聲，抖搜的精神，顯示出第二階段中新生的力最是在飛躍的發展中，街頭特大的壁報，以通俗的文字，生動的諷剌圖畫，淸晣的地圖，簡明有力的標語口號，完全改變以往枯燥空洞的作風，而以簇新的姿態出現。路上忽忽地經過的除了武裝同志之外，穿着靑斜布制服的救運靑年男女同志，也任忽忙地熙攘往來。</p>
<p>到來此地不過兩天，但碰見已往同在一塊兒工作的同志已不下數百，他們自廣州撤退後分散到東江西江南路各處，有的在前線隨軍服務，有的在淪陷區加入了游擊隊，有的在後方幹着民運，可是最近却不期而遇的許多團體都匯集到這裏來——當然，這並不是說他們放下了工作而來，而是各團體都有一部份子到來這裏，有些在受着訓練，有些是經過此地作暫時的逗留，另外還有一些是政府機關主辦的團體，被派在此地經常工作的。茲將從各方探得的情形作概括的　述：</p>
<p>現目在曲江的團體有抗先總隊，抗×靑年前衛團，靑年羣，新運會婦女工委會，四戰區政工大隊，軍委　第五政工大隊，省救護委會第一大隊，此外還有保安政治大隊，省黨部主辦社會服務處，曲江縣民敎館等。</p>
<p>一，抗先總隊</p>
<p>『抗先』是廣東靑年抗×先鋒隊的簡稱，在廣州未失陷以前已是統一的靑年組織，當時人數約有二千人，去年「一，二一」，從廣州步行出發，那時粵省動員委員會組織的政治工作隊，其中大部分都是抗先的份子。後來在各地工作時逐漸發展，已在各縣成立了十七處分部（卽縣隊部），在預算中一共有廿三個縣隊部，總隊部前設新興，二月初才遷來曲江。</p>
<p>三月廿一至廿四日，抗先總隊部開第三次全體委員會議，當地黨政長官曾與會領導，除了檢討已往工作外，還决定了仿後青運方針：</p>
<p>（一）信奉三民主義，實踐抗戰建國綱領，竭誠擁護政府，擁護蔣委員長，擁護統一戰線，參加一切抗戰工作，</p>
<p>（二）緊急動員廣大靑年到隊去，到各種武裝隊伍去，直接參加戰爭以及緊急動員民衆，在戰地，在淪陷區展開游擊戰，打擊并消滅×人。</p>
<p>（三）號召靑年，踴躍參加政府各種軍事政治訓練班，養成軍事政治幹部人材。</p>
<p>（四）本着鞏固團結，反對分裂，互相帮助，互相發展和民生原則，充實原有各地靑年組織，進而建立全省靑年統一戰線。</p>
<p>最近各委員已返各地推進工作。抗先的平日工作約有下列幾方面：</p>
<p>（一）武裝團隊——約有三百人在十二集團軍內工作，另一部份在增城一帶打游擊。</p>
<p>（二）民衆組——在各鄉成立民衆抗×協會，民衆訓練班等。</p>
<p>（三）團結靑年——已有全省統一組織的初步基礎，人數最近有六千餘。</p>
<p>（四）自我敎育——母週隊員有小組會，座談會，行軍演習等。</p>
<p>二、抗青前衛團</p>
<p>也是去年「十，廿一」退出廣州。但因為退出時間較促，甚感狼狽，致受相當損失，全團人數較少，約有二百餘，他們工作約分三方面：一是參加政府主待的工作，一是開展民衆組織，一是團聚原有份子及吸收新進份子，從事補充和調整，總隊部現時亦設在曲江。</p>

<p>【美聯社倫敦十四日電】英外部今日向駐蘇英大使發出特別訓令一通、內容無從探悉、惟聞英大使將於最近與蘇外交委員長李維諾夫舉行晤談、此或爲英蘇兩國將成立有限制之軍事協定之徵兆、據稱除非駐西意軍於五月初卽行撤退、則英國將被迫而宣吿廢棄英意友好協定、據未證實消息、謂英大使行將與蘇政府談判締結空軍協定、以陸上合作之困難、此事固正合邏輯者也、外交界方面認爲希特勒現正從外交上進行反對立陶宛、此實爲希特勒對「反希勒特」集團之首次答復云、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦十四日電】英外交部向駐蘇英大使發出特別訓令之消息、已得官方證實、英使與蘇外委李維諾夫之會談、已改於星期六日舉行、英蘇航空協定之舉、前途雖未可推定、但相信英方正準備向蘇認眞進行談判、</p>

<h3>英法宣言反響</h3>
<p>【倫敦十四日電】下院各黨對首相昨日宣言之主要决斷、均一致擁護之情形、可於今日各報評論見之泰晤士報引述對波蘭、希臘、及羅馬尼亞所給予之保證稱、自是一向被視爲立於侵略暴力的茅尖之波、希、羅三國可　以稍釋其憂慮矣、蓋因一旦被迫而爲自由抗戰時、則應戰者固不僅彼等三國而已也、英國政策業已作大步之前進、英國此次所爲、殊非不經意之措施、而其承諾此項責任之先、亦早經深思熟慮、明白此項責任之意義、英國此舉、可以代表一種由於時局演變所產生的正確民族自决、赛爲無瑕可擊云、</p>

<p>【美聯社羅馬十四日電】蓋達本日在「意大利日報」著評、痛斥張伯倫之論及阿爾巴尼亞事件、幷宜稱、亞得里亞海中、英國幷無利益、蓋達論及達拉第之宣言、謂不値一評、因法國自一九三五年欺騙意大利後、在歐洲政治舞台、已無足輕値矣、</p>
<p>【海通社匈京四日電】此間現以匈牙利改革派之眼光、考慮英法之保瞪、對於西方兩大民主國之宣言、一般認爲尙非在任何强力要求之下、絕對保證巴爾幹兩國之主權者、因此和平修正條約、尙非絕不可能、某報力言張伯倫及達拉第之官言、並無對羅馬尼亞現存邊界予以保證、而在匈羅兩國之間、尙冇須待解决之問題而須在兩國成立睦隣關係以前、加以解决者云、</p>

<h3>暹羅與越南</h3>
<p>在未來的世界大戰中　遠東民族容易受法西斯侵略國的引誘的怕只有暹羅吧！</p>
<p>爲了英法兩國强相互牽制的緣故、暹羅的運道、要比它的鄰國緬甸、安南好、在十八九世起、始終成爲一個緩衝國、沒有遭受亡國之痛、可是它的領土却被局部牽割九次了</p>
<p>暹雜的人口一千五百萬　、我們僑胞的人口要佔二百五十萬、除了害怕英法爪分之外、還要擔心國內經濟權落在華僑手中、因此今天暹羅在亞洲的地位和匈牙利在歐洲的地位差不多、它所要求的是收復前世紀以來的失地、獲得眞正的獨立自主、</p>
<p>這是暹羅民族正當的要求、所不幸的、暹羅沒有用正當的革命手段、去求貫澈他的正當要求、爲了反對帝國主義、反而投到帝國主義的懷抱裏、自從九一八以後、暹羅是露骨的表示親日排華的唯一亞洲國家、一九三三年間、國際聯盟通過讉責日本的决議案的時候、只有選羅棄權、暹羅境內的華僑、時時受着殘酷的待遇、抗日的言論集會自由是完全剝奪了、</p>
<p>近年暹羅的軍隊、騁用了日本的顧問、購買了日本軍火、政治上受日本的影響很大、日本想貸欸給暹羅　開鑿克拉遝河、使遠東船舶、可以不經新加坡、直達印度洋、這一個工程假如成功、對於英國在遠東的軍事和商業地位、不用說會有嚴重的損害、這個計劃雖然因了英國的反對而暫時擱置、但是並沒有完全拋棄、</p>
<p>自從德意日反共協定簽字之後　德國勎力也潛入暹羅、殺近德國供給暹羅的軍火的數量很不少、這更加增加了英法的不安、雖然目前暹羅還沒有加入反共協定的可能、可是暹羅的政府要人已相屢次表示同情于反共集團的政府了、　（未完）</p>
<h3>佛朗哥軍隊準備宣告復員</h3>

<h3>英法蘇談判空軍合作</h3>
<p>昨日倫敦每日電訊報外交記者報吿，『英法蘇三國當局現正考慮宣佈；在彼等所保證之任何一國家遭受侵攻時，英法蘇三國空軍採取共同行動之計劃，英蘇目前之外交談判，即與此計劃有關。」</p>
<p>這個消息是否能爲事實·固然未便懸揣，但至少可以證明英法目前已感此種需要，而此種消息乃適爲英法大多數人士所歡迎。因爲目前要反抗侵略保障和平，非聯合蘇聯不可，這是早已成爲普遍的常識了，不過要聯合蘇聯，决非空口說說就算，必須有密切合作的事實、而英法蘇空軍合作·自爲民主和平各國今後反抗侵略弭止戰禍的有效保障。</p>
<p>我們歡迎英法蘇空軍合作成爲事實，自無待說；但是爲要眞正保障和平，不使其局限於暫合的與局部的，則尙有進而考慮英法美蘇的海軍時作，這樣才能保障東北歐，近東和遠東的集體安全；如果這種要求能够實現，我們相信德意日三大侵略魔王就不能不俯首貼耳了！如果我們努力，如果民主和平國家的國民反侵略運動進展，這種要求决不會是空虛的理想的！</p>

<p>（路透社華盛頓十四日電）美總統羅斯福、今日在汎美聯盟董事會發表演說、謂「舊世界現正陷於悲慘之漩渦中」、舊恨新仇、一時爆發、而美洲之所能堅持特立者、固由於美洲獲得獨立自由之時、奢產生一種新興與堅強之理想、卽成立一國際聯合也、汎美國家曾公開會議、成立公開協定、「吾人之所以舉行會議、並非爲戰爭之結果、而爲吾人期望和平所促成」、總統繼謂、舊世界之步入一新禍亂階段、並非命運使然、「人類並非命運之囚徒、而但受其本人野心之驅使、數日以前、某大國領袖曾指其本國爲地中海之囚徒、後又有某大國元首、探悉其鄰國已承允保衛其第一鄰國之獨立時、竟認此協定爲威脅與包圍、然事實上斷無任何愛好和平國家包圍、威脅或覊囚其他愛好和平國家之理一、羅斯福氏繼又抨擊「征服他人之迷夢」、認此爲「可笑及犯罪之行爲」、彼又謂、「吾人今日慶祝之美洲和平、幷無弱點存在、吾人準備以吾人之全力維護及保衞此和平、如冀圖破壞此組織及損及吾人團體中之任何分子者、吾人决以武力還擊武力、如有以經濟壓迫爲手段者、吾願保證亦將以吾國之經濟實力爲後援、使美洲任何國家、不至犧牲其主權上之自由、以換取經濟利益、」羅斯福氏繼又稱、美洲各國今亦將向全世界發表其主張、「吾人所注意者、並非如何、保衛吾人之海岸線而已、經濟上之機構、已使全世界逐漸成爲一個單位、任何一地受其擾亂時、必至影響及于其他各地、下代之人物、將感到須如何設法、使新舊世界得以同存共榮、除非吾人成爲他國之附庸、則吾人有權說明、任何國際事務之組織、吾人皆有參加之權、美洲維護和平信守不渝之概念、更有賴於海外各國、亦能拋棄戰亂思想、吾人亦爲國際情勢之中流砥柱、吾人對和平之願望、與互相保衞之信念、同其堅強、使暫時戰勝及求無價値之光榮之心變爲忠實、犧牲及紀律之精神、至是吾人方可以重奠國際紀律、此乃新世界致舊世界之箴言也」、羅斯福氏繼謂、彼相信新世界之共和國、力仍足以協助舊世界防止可怕事件之發生、述及集權國家曾以被包圍而抗議、羅斯福氏謂、去歲美國曾向加拿大保證、如加拿大一旦受海外之攻擊時、美國將與之聯合抵抗、後又在利馬發表汎美國家宣言、表示共同合作、以保衞其組織之直接或間接受外來侵略、「惟並無任何一國、認爲因此已使另一國成其他國家之囚徒、或已遭受其他國家之包圍、吾人此種措施、並非爲戰爭之保證、而實爲和平之保證、蓋美洲中並無任何一國、意存侵略或獨佔自尊也、如此舉在此獲得成功、豈此舉不能成功於他處乎、吾人是否認爲除適用數百年前之破壞手段、然後方能達到其目的耶、吾人之文化是否將永陷於無底軍國主義及不斷戰事之悲慘漩渦中、而不能自拔、抑吾人將維持理想之和平及個別之文化、而視此爲吾人生命中之要伴耶」、</p>
<p>美國政策爭論　兩派形成樹立</p>
<p>【美聯社華盛頓十五日電】羅斯福演說發表後、美國外交政策之爭論、顯已形成互對之局、一部份人士對羅斯福欲干涉歐局之意、頗爲懷疑、因無人能斷定、所謂軍事與經濟援助、在何種範圍之內、方足以避免漩入歐洲戰爭也、目下政府之外交政策、自羅斯福與赫爾先後發表演說後、顯已决定路綫、（一）美國願以武力及經濟援助拉丁美洲諸國、以應付獨裁者之侵略、（二）美國將領導西半球諸國、一致反對以戰爭與征服爲已任之國家、（三）如戰爭發生、美國决不參加、唯盡力以使戰爭中止擁護總統之人士、如民主黨之要員及共和黨之史汀生、均對此項主張、一體贊助、認爲咿美國干涉歐局、乃能獲得世界和平、反對羅斯福政策者、爲大部參議員、彼等認爲　羅斯福此次之演說、徒使歐洲戰爭空氣更爲緊張、反有引起某某國家輕舉妄動之可能、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦十四日電】此間對羅斯福演說、一致好評、各方希望羅斯福之演詞　能使獨裁國家之軍事活動、稍加斂跡、</p>
<p>【美聯社巴黎十四日電】此間對羅斯福之演說、甚表歡迎、尤其對羅氏否認各國目下進行包圍政策、及表示將來空軍可以遠渡重洋、極爲重視、因後者、顯足爲美國軍事方面之反映也、</p>
<p>【美聯社柏林十四日電】此間官方斥羅斯福之演說、謂羅斯福實爲張伯倫包圍政策之先驅、宣傳部稱、「吾人其能希望自美記者所稱之包圍政策之父口中、獲得其他語言哉」、</p>

<h3>廠商考察團歸港　澳門三日</h3>
<p>— 景南</p>
<p>葉蘭泉談此行的收獲</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>香港廠商澳門玫察團、在澳攷察三天、昨日下午四時、又辭別了將來實業發展的目的地了。別時正是風　　。雨蕭蕭，這象徵着中華民族的命運，撼動着每一個團員的心靈。</p>
<p>考察團以三天的時間赴了兩個　會，三個茶會，拜訪了五個以上的當地政府要員，和華僑領袖，這短短的三天，用來踏勘廠址，考察一般情形及來樹立海外華僑民族資本當然是不够的，可是，考察圑此舉，有兩個事實，已經明顯地展開着大家面前要我們不能不注意到的：第一，抗戰後華僑投資祖國實業問題，第二，抗戰期中，發展後方生產，增强抗戰實力問題。但，這兩個問題，在這裏略略提出來就算吧，我還是說說攷察三天收將穫好。</p>
<p>在歸途輪上，許多圍人着團長葉蘭泉先生致賀，他老人家這回領隊的成功，最低限度來講：都有二點値得提出的：（一）使港澳僑胞進一步的團結　（二）因考察圑團員精神的良好，使友邦人士認識中華民族的偉大與進步。這兩點，就是老察團所予澳鬥僑胞與葡人觀點上說的，它另外還有辦了兩件好事，一件是捐了數百元給澳門難民營的難胞，第二件，是捐助五百元給無原　工藝學校，建築一個「香港廠商考察團紀念堂。」至于它此行原定目的是否得到圓滿收穫哩，雖然現在未能够十分確定，但我聽見有一間玻璃廠和一間硫酸廠已經决定在澳門說立了，這兩間工廠是因爲廣州淪陷的懷抱的。</p>
<p>葉團長在輪中談及此行印象說，「澳門政府對我們投資是歡迎的，我以為　仔是可以設廠的，但，一憫最重要問題仍須等待一個星期才能次定一切的事，這就是買地皮間題，因爲在澳門買地皮，在法律上須用葡國人註册的，現在，梁後源先生說，這個法律手續已經不存在了，即使是這麼樣子，我們還須等待梁先生于一星期後，把地皮圖則繪就給我們看過，才來决定的。我們自己，也須等待各廠報吿所得的意見」。</p>
<p>澳門政府對廠商要求已表示盡力給予各種方便，如减輕水費，電費、工人年齡及工作時間等限制，都答應予以可能的通融，這可算是攷察圑此行確知的限制了·那裏祇有幾憫設工廠的條件，留待考察的，也許，許多個團員心目中已有很好的主意了。在圑員中有一個對于設厰素有學力和經驗的提出了下列幾點，我把它寫出來做這篇的尾巴，以爲大家一個參攷；做實業中心區的地方所需要具備的條件，大致如下；（一）製迭原料容易獲得，（二）接近市場，（三）運輸方便，（四）人力之獲得，（五）其他一般設廠上之便利。</p>
<h3>狂歡的香港週末</h3>
<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>星期六的下午到了。市中心的「維多利亞城」充滿了緊張的空氣。</p>
<p>洋行，機關和銀行裏的大小職員們都忙着，結束了他們底工作，「放工」去。</p>
<p>工廠底「血盤大口」似的大門也開放了把千百疲乏的勞作者嘔吐出來。</p>
<p>學校的學生哥，學生姐們，像小麻雀般跳躍着，挽着書包囘家去，帶着無限的愉快，他（她）們亨受一天又半的休假。</p>
<p>馬路上，車輛特別密，汽車，巴士，電車，一串一串，來來往往，交織着，大小職員，工人，學生·男人，女人，潮水般，湧來，湧去，大家都露着忽忙的態度，帶着急迫的步伐跑着路。</p>
<p>華貴的菜館裏，坐滿了富商，巨賈，買辦，大職員，和髙等難民，一般茶居，餐室也坐滿了大小職員，工人和學生，午餐，有的安閒地，享受着較豐富的一頓，因爲今天是星期六，下午不須辦公，不須趕時間，有的却更忽忙，更「草草」地吃，因爲今天是期六下午不須工作，却趕着要去找娯樂，尋消遣。</p>
<p>下午二時半快到了，電影院門前站滿了人，廣吿畫上，半裸的美女，申出豐滿，雪白的大腿，招引着紳士，太太，小姐和少爺們。</p>
<p>二時半，五時一刻，七時一刻的坐位都賣淸光，九時半的也决賣完「座位已滿」的紙牌掛遍每一間戲院的每一個賣票房，</p>
<p>每隔一星期便有一次的「特別賽馬」，當然也就吸收了相當消遣週末的市民。</p>
<p>快活谷裏，有千百富商巨賈，千百中國和外國的紳士，高等難民，和小市民們也不肯放過運氣，他（她）也到馬場來和富商們一起賭賭幸運。他（她）們不祇是消遣，是享樂，還是想發財。鈔票引着馬，馬引着人，追逐，追逐，大家追逐着的還是鈔票。</p>
<p>和馬場隔不遠的便是足球場，說起足球，大家都知道『球迷』們廣於足球是怎樣看法的了，闊人們固然花幾塊洋，算不得什麽一囘事，普羅球迷，當了一套衣服來買張門券去『睇波』的亦大有人在。傳說有某街市小販，父子兩人都是球迷、逢週來賽足球便不『開檔』，連生意也不幹去看球哩。</p>
<p>本地球迷旣然這樣踴躍，避難而來的球　也不讓人，他們「迷」的程度幷不低下，所以目前的週末球賽每一場都人山人海，不到下午三時，快活谷或加露連山便給人包圍個水洩不通．</p>
<p>下午五時至七時的茶舞，在星期六當然不會冷場，少年紳士們，不會放過牠的。誘惑，興奮的爵士音樂早把這一羣都市兒女們陶醉在舞池裏。</p>
<p>下午七時來臨了，夜的黑幔，籠罩了香島。「魔鬼的陽光一——這燈和霓虹管！即放出柔媚，引誘，刺激的光線來，找開心的時間到了，夜生活的序樂由　士樂班髙奏出來。</p>
<p>菜館，餐室比中午更熱閙，更流行的「雀局」也在每一間菜館底每一間旳「廳」和俱樂部　開始「作戰」，擘擘拍拍的蔴雀聲，非到星期日早上二時不會停止。</p>
<p>每一間餐室，每間一酒店的電話線都和每一所「道遊社」的電話線含接起來。酒店的小房間，落下布幔的餐室卡坐都是女導遊員，「導」客人「遊」的場合。</p>
<p>花枝招展的導遊姑娘都跟鈴鈴不停的電話鐘聲忙起來。</p>
<p>八時後，舞場又開始緊張起來，出賣腰肢和大腿的彈性姑娘們，誰也知道星期六之夕是特別忙的時間，誰也想在星期六之夕多拿幾張舞票，多坐幾檯子，多……</p>
<p>在都市的僻靜的幾個角落裏，凄淡的路證照耀之下，穿着黑衣服的傭婦們正忙着，伴着，穿得花碌碌塗濃脂厚粉的神女們，去幹她們可憐的勾當。</p>
<p>神女，是都市的可憐女兒，在她們一羣裏，竟然有十三四歲的女孩子！</p>
<p>記得不久以前，『救世軍』開年會時，討論到『童娼』問題，主席先生下過這樣的結論，他說，『她們對於賣淫或餓死之外，簡直再無可選擇……』！</p>
<p>夜生活的腐化，勞工們的也要遭它侵蝕　——</p>
<p>在星期六晚上，蔴雀牌館特別興旺，這種下級牌館，多是一間普通店戶，裏面　着十張八張四方檯，每張檯有着一枝電燈，檯上放着麻雀牌，或天九牌，任何人都可以入去『打牌』，祗要你繳出相當手續費，這樣費用是照賭錢的『注』數捅出幾成的，它叫做『抽水』。倘若你不够四人，他們底『伙記』可以和你凑够來玩。</p>
<p>他們打蔴雀牌都是「散計」——「地莊」——的，縱然你祇有兩角錢你也可以入去搓幾「手」，輸了可以跑，贏了搓下去，因爲如此，所以入息很少的人也給他吸引了，輸乾輸凈。</p>
<p>賭，大概是下層社曾唯一的娛樂吧（？）他們　頭迷腦地賭到天亮。</p>
<p>寄生在賭上的生意，像小咖啡店，小冰室，「烟格」「紅丸館」，下乘私娼窩……也述帶地興旺擠擁起來。</p>
<p>或許是五天半的機械生活把他（她）們的疲乏麻木吧（？）香港的週來是狂樂，頽廢的時光，一到星期六的下午，大家便忘記了一切，忘記了戰事，忘記了自己，忘記了他人，盡情歡樂，沉迷下去。一直到星期日光早的來臨。</p>
<p>星期日上午十二待，很多人才從被窩裏出來。</p>

<p>我們在戰區鄉村，從事於戲劇工作，二十個月以來，使我們深切的感到，要戲劇在抗戰中發揮大的效果，只有把它和實生活密切的聯系起來。血腥的現實，敎訓了每一個人，自然也教訓了每一個戲劇工作者，要進步，要長成，必須把自已溶化到抗戰中去，擺在我們面前的，只有兩條路，成長或死滅，想在這中間取巧，必爲時代所揚。</p>
<p>其實，不獨戲劇如此，一切工作都是這樣的。</p>
<p>前年（一九三七）八月，我們由上海出發，經過蘇，皖，豫，鄂，湘，桂，粤…諸省，我們看到許多戰爭中各方面的情形，這些情形吿訴我們，三切都在動，每一個部門的工作者，每一個民衆，都在向前邁進，都在盡最大的力量供獻於抗戰中國是在加速的進步，加速的成長。</p>
<p>二十個月抗戰過程中的一切現象，使我們有確切的把握，保證我們必勝的前途，這是一個不移的眞理，不容任何人有絲毫壤疑的。我們應該把握住這一眞理，加緊的奮鬥下去！</p>
<p>委員長在南嶽會議中，指示出在第二期抗戰的現階設；「政治重於軍事」，「宣傳重於作戰」，這充分的顯示了文化工作的重要性。我們從事於文化工作的人，應該以這一指示爲據，追隨於諸先進之後·勉力工作。</p>
<p>現在，我們要結束國內二十個月的工作，走向國外，去完成另一個任務：去將抗戰以來，我軍的英勇戰績，各方面在抗戰中表現的偉　大力量，軍民合作的情况，軍事上政治上的進步，向僑胞作更普遍更具體的宣傳，以鞏固僑胞抗戰勝利的信心，提高僑胞抗戰情緖，開展僑胞救亡運動，使其有力出力，有錢出錢；去揭露，摧殘文化宗敎，濫肆轟炸，施放毒氣，危害外僑諸暴行。幷暴露×閥欲併吞中國，獨佔遠東市場，排斥各國在華經濟利益之野心，破壞國際公約之野蠻行爲，向世界和平挑釁之陰謀，及其日漸沒落的事實，並說明其終必爲新生的中國所擊破之理由，以促進國際對我作更實際之援助。同時，去募集五十萬元捐款，建立傷兵收容站十所，傷兵醫院五所，戰地文化供應總站一所，支站十所，創設殘廢軍人及　　軍人家屬陣亡將士家屬習藝所十所，以部分的解决我們在戰地工作時所見到的急需解决的問題。這一任務實在是相當的艱鉅。但我們願盡最大的努力去完成。多盡一分力量，我們多一分愉快，對于抗戰中的祖國，也多一點微未的貢獻。不過，這貢獻是必須借助於親愛的僑胞，方能完成的。我們深信僑胞會給我們在工作上以莫大的助力！</p>
<p>我們從烽火中來，我們怎樣也不能忘懷正在苦鬥中的祖國的兄弟。我們打算把這一件工作很快的完成，很快的回到祖國來，囘到前線去，與英勇的兄弟在一起，參與最後勝利的大决戰！　（四月十日於救亡社）</p>

<h3>舞臺技術講話</h3>
<p>— 盧敦</p>
<p>八重音和標點</p>
<p>話劇的生命，在于對話，演員唸台詞動聽，是該以控制操縱觀眾的情緒的，這當然是語調抑揚頓挫之運用得法，方才收到這樣的效果。可是語調之抑揚頓挫，該怎樣去運用呢？這是大有研究的。</p>
<p>演員的念詞，主要的目的，是要把每一句台詞的含義完全的表達出來，這是與抑揚有關係的。不過，抑揚的運用，還不單是表達了詞句的含義，主要是傳達情感。</p>
<p>詞句　揚的運用，固然要看字韻，仝時又要找出句里應該着重的地方，這叫做「重音」·項音的所在，往往就一句里節癸的中心，比方一句話：「張三給人殺死了了」這一句的重昔就在「殺」這一个宇，因爲這一个字是全句中最主要的意思，是必須稍爲誇大地表達出來的，就由這一重音而决定了一句的抑揚。</p>
<p>同時，重音的錯誤，又往往可使相仝的句子變成不同的意義，比方「你在做什麼」？只這幾个字，但如果重音的地位不同，就可以有不同的効果：如集音昔在「什麽」，意思就是「你曾吿訴說你在做一件事，但是究竟是什麽事」？重音在「在」，就成爲　你現在在做什麽呀」？重昔在「你」，就有點罵他的意思；如果重昔在「做」，就成爲「我們已經聽到過你的意見了，但是你眞正做了些什麽呢」？如東着重不在任何一個字上，則全句都重要，而變成請求的語氣。</p>
<p>因此，要把對話的含義正確地表達出來，適當的重音是必要的，重音不對可以歪曲作者原意，因爲要解决重音中的困難。演員在讀詞時，必須先事研究，找出重音之所在，再加以練習。</p>
<p>一段台詞，多數是由幾句句子構成的，因此斷句是必須注意的。</p>
<p>在那些以幾句句子構成的一段台詢中，先要看看每一斷句的標點，普通逗點，稍停，支點和句點可以稍停長久一點，這也不是一定的，必須看語勢情緖而决定；但句與句之間停頓之最短是很緊要的，因爲這就是表情的地方了。有些演員往往在這種停頓的地方停的　長，而每一停頓的時間都是平均的這就不大好，因為如此，就沒有快慢節奏了。有時候，一段長的台詞，雖然其中分開幾句，而一口氣把它念完，不加停頓，往往是可以取得効果的，這在喜劇上應用最多。</p>
<p>不過，所謂不加停頓一口氣唸完，也並不是說句與句之間完全沒停頓，不過是停頓的時間非常短促，而以語氣作爲標點，使觀衆聽起來，可以聽得懂，分得出一句一句來。</p>
<p>錯俠的斷句又是往往使句子發生不同的意思的，可以舉一個俗語爲例，如「路不通行，不得在此小便」。斷句的地方是行字，念詞的時候頓，停的地方就在行字之後，但如果念的時候，停頓的地方弄錯了，把它念成：「路不通，行不得，在此小便。」則整句的意思就完全弄成相反了。所以，念詞時候，斷句停頓的地方是應該特別注意的，有時候，雖然是一句很長很長的句子，如果當中沒停頓之符號及可能，就千萬不要在隨便一個當中停頓，必須一口氣念完爲了表情的原故，也只可以着重于重音，或者某一兩個字音拖長——之類，但不能完全停了下來，</p>
<p>有些演員常常是把一句中，每兩個字兩個字念出來好像演說一樣，沒不但有情　，也不自然，不像說話，叫人聽起來是非常討　的，</p>
<p>總之，念詞是演員們底主要的功課，非得多多練習不可。（未完）</p>
<h3>青年劇協歡迎中救劇團大會速寫</h3>
<p>— 朱白水</p>
<p>夥伴們，在工作中緊密攜手起來！</p>
<p>這是香港靑年戲劇工作者底一個難忘的歡叙呵！</p>
<p>爲了歡迎我們底戰士，歡迎在祖國烽火中鬥爭了十九個月的夥伴們，香港靑年戲劇協會發起了全香港的靑年戲劇社團舉行了個歡迎『中國救亡劇圑』大會。</p>
<p>到的社團有紅白劇圍，新聲劇社，蘆烽劇社。弓劇社，紅藍劇團，靱鬥劇團業餘劇團，鐵沬劇團，螞蟻兒童劇團，先鋒兒童劇團，靑年同樂社，丁丑劇社，旋風劇社，學德勵志社，中華書局劇團，惠靑戲劇組，宣訓班戲劇組，靑年團，廣大劇社，學賑西區戲劇組，總動員地有着三四百個夥伴們，是香港戲劇工作者破記錄的歡叙。</p>
<p>擠擁而歡欣地充滿了華南中學底禮堂，每個人都交織在興奮和熱情中，大家都渴望着貴賓底來臨，心坎裏是含蘊着崇高的敬仰和英雄的采膽呢！</p>
<p>終于，熱烈的掌聲中，肅立的歡迎中，我們底英勇的戰士——甲國救亡劇團的夥伴們，一行二十餘人出現在我們底盛會中了。</p>
<p>一種極度的興奮和狂熱的情緖飄蕩在我們的當中—</p>
<p>戴着眼鏡的年輕的主席站起來致了簡潔的開場白，跟着由陸浮先生，詳細地報吿和介紹「中國救亡劇團」底生長和鬥爭的歷程，使大家更深刻明晰的了解這夥戰士們的歷史和戰績。</p>
<p>這是一陣怎樣急劇而熱烈的掌聲呵，我們底英勇的先行者，今夕的貴賓，金山先生以英維樣的姿態高高地站在我們的面前了。</p>
<p>他充滿了興奮嚴莊，却燃燒在熱情和歡樂中，以宏亮而動人的音調，以舞台上的演員，以戰場上的戰士式的開始了演詞——</p>
<p>首先他報吿他們從八一三抗戰開始後在上海救亡演演劇移勸第二隊的組織中出發到內地工作去，先後經過蘇州，南京，徐州，開封，鄭州，洛陽，漢口，商城，麻城，而溯粤漢路南下，轉湘入桂的經歷，在十九個月的當中，他們像士兵·農民一樣地生活着，在工作的渦程中，他們了解，並且堅决地相信中國是有救的，中團抗戰是會獲得最後勝利的！</p>
<p>他指出鬥爭在廣大戰區中的政治工作靑年，戲劇工作靑年等底堅决和英勇，刻苦和沈毅，因此，他强調地說：目前是不需要「電影明星」，需要的是參加抗戰的靑年救亡工作者！</p>
<p>——一陣熱烈的鼓掌使大家更振奮的仰瞻着他。</p>
<p>因爲是夕到會的都是從事抗戰劇運的靑年工作者，因此他具體即指州抗戰中戲劇的力量和效果是怎樣的，並且用了四五個實例的工作報吿去說明。</p>
<p>他詳細報吿怎樣利用演劇去感動和說明了一個殺人不　眼的大地主起來參加抗戰，利用演劇去發動民衆參加游擊隊，利用演戲去轉變了當小漢好的孩子們和眞正的漢奸們等，這都時寶貴的經驗和動人的事蹟。</p>
<p>跟着他堅决地說現階段的戲劇底內容是要現實的，生動的，丰富的，情感的，有肉有血的，沒有空虛也沒有幻想，完全是在實生活中表現着的。眞正的藝術是代表着國家底靈魂，新的藝術是在民族革命中產生的！</p>
<p>「爲什麼救亡戲劇會蓬勃而廣大地發展着呢？每個從事救亡戲劇的靑年工作是怎樣地鬥爭在祖國呢……？」金山先生是這樣有力地反問着，所有的人都沉默而肅穆的望蒲他：「每個工作者都有高度的熱情和深刻的政治認識，除了忙迫的工作和少量的睡眠外，每個人都沉溺在研究抗戰形勢的發展，國際政治的變動，他們生活是絕對民衆化，不浪沒，不靡爛，和農民士兵打成一片的，工作的內容是最現實的，决沒有半點空想，幷且工作在戰區中的工作者，是絕對團結地沒有任何磨擦的！」</p>
<p>他滔滔不絕地以有力的聲調敵擊着每個人底心門，以一種富有戲劇性的姿態揮動看結實的拳臂，最後，他强烈地昂語：</p>
<p>『祗有團結才能發揮最大的力量，在目前，是需要廣大的靑年工作者到內地去，發動民衆來參加民族抗戰，到戰習區等去，到農村學習去，士兵·農民工人是，我們最良好的學習者學　！</p>
<p>在偉大的民族革命抗戰中鍛鍊出來的戰士底英姿，是使每個人都永恆不忘的，金山先生就這樣的感動了每個人。</p>
<p>王瑩先生跟着站在我們的前面了，她微笑，她結實，她莊重，她開始報吾她們隊伍的工作過程，工作是繁重而忙迫的，但生活却是刻苦而堅毅，住的是民房，廟宇，食的是和士丘農民一樣的，前後曾演出過七百多次，從沒有爲自己團體賣過一次票。</p>
<p>王先生很詳細地報吿工作的經驗，最後她沉毅地說武裝我們的精神，在自己的工作崗位上作堅强的鬥爭！</p>
<p>又是一陣急劇而熱烈的掌聲，秣樞先生跟着王瑩先生的結詞而站出來了，林先生是一位有極度半富的政治軍事修養的入，因此，他劈頭就拿在精衛的『舉一個例』來痛斥一回，並且很正確的分柝曾伸　的死，汪精衞的逆黨叛國，說得痛快淋漓，使每個人都刺激得很憤慨的。</p>
<p>林先生更正確地以數字統計去確證×人在戰爭中的損失，這種損失是使×人走向于崩潰和失敗中去的！中國的抗戰是爭取全面的，不在一點一綫之爭，祇要每個中華民國的國民都是一個英勇的鬥士，那麽最後勝利是我們的！</p>
<p>范政，中國救亡劇團唯一的小戰士，在林先生的介紹中，在悠長而熱烈的掌聲中，他結實而果敢地站在台了。</p>
<p>他的年紀最多也不過十三歲吧，他是慘痛地從東北失陷後逃亡着，然而，他不愿做小奴隸小難民，他要復仇，他要鬥爭，這樣他就英勇地在祖國烽火中生長着。</p>
<p>他報吿在祖國中鬥爭着的兒童劇圑的姿態，如新安旅行團，孩子劇團·廈門兒童救亡劇圍等等，最後並描述安徽抗日兒童團底英勇的殺×工作，是那樣的使人感動呵！</p>
<p>最後還有參與盛會的敎育家方興讓先生的致詞，金山先生並懇摯的希望香港劇運工作加强工作，圑結起來！</p>
<p>在强烈的燈光照耀下使得每人的在發亮，不，興奮很通紅，桌子上的桔子，花生米和餅干等早已經過剝削而成　殘餘的榨滓了，我們在與奮，歡笑，湊趣中交織一片。</p>
<p>趣緻的餘興加濃了大家的熱情與興奮，王瑩的「蘆溝橋」，范政旳「汪精衛」，朱國萍的「兒童先　歌」，救亡劇圑的「我們是靑年演劇隊員」，螞蟻劇團的「歌八百壯土」……</p>
<p>在「義勇軍進行曲」底合唱中，每個人底心坎，都在熱烈地燃燒若熱烈的希望——祖國在鬥爭中踏上勝利的前途！</p>

<h3>批評電影的幾點注意點</h3>
<p>— 白雪</p>
<p>有了電影，跟着就產生了批評。每一部片子的觀客，甚至於非觀客，時常都在批評電影，無論他批評的態度怎樣，其中最容易被人注意的，是寫出來而且已經發表了的影評文字。每個人可以批評電影，但很少人能作適當恰切的批評。很多人可以寫影評文字，但很少有價値的影評。這爲文字實在是「批判之批判」，僅是說明了批評電影必需注意的幾點：</p>
<p>第一，如果要批評一部片子，必需看過那部片子</p>
<p>——這一點似乎似笑話，事實上確是批評電影的第一個不可少的步驟。譬如香港幾家著名報紙所通行的一輪片公演當日見報的影評，多數就是沒有看過片子而寫的批評。作者多半是參考了外國報章雜誌的批評，翻譯之後，再加以自己預測的意見而寫成影評。其實這種文字稱爲「影評」是不十分適當的，最好是稱爲「觀影指南」或「新片介紹」。但這些文字很多有參考價値的，而且寫起來也許比看片後的批評費力氣。不過因爲是未看之先的預測，或者以他的批評爲批評，總不免有錯誤。再如一般粤語片很少有人批評。批評一種東西必需那種東西有値得批評的價値。但即使是最壞的東西，也自有它被批評的價値，惟其壤，越需要正確的批評來糾正它。粤語片之所以缺乏批評，正不在它本身的價値如何，就是　爲「要批評一部片子，必要看過那部片子」，而有批評能力的人，却很少有精神來做這番「看」的功夫。</p>
<p>第二，如果要批評電影必需要懂得電影</p>
<p>——常常可以聽到「他根本就不懂，這批評些甚麽」。事實上，電影的人很少，但批評電影的人很多，其中固然有以不知爲知之的，但多數還是就他所懂的一部份加以立論。懂得少的，作淺近的批評。懂得多的，作專門的批評。大致演員表演的好壞，故事的好壞，多數人是容易了解的：技巧的運用，氣氛的造成，觀衆雖然受了感應，但多數人是不了解的，所以前者堂被批評，後者很少有人能批評，原因是知其當然不知其所以然。賣錢的片子，不一定是好，好的片子，不一定賣錢」，一方面固然當爲電影商人的，「定命論」所造成。（商人根據觀衆心理。猜測某一種片子太受歡迎，則減少宣傳，排在「冷」日子放演，其實正未必然。）一方面就是由於好片子的好點，禾能爲觀衆所「懂」。譬如一般粤語片的主要觀衆，——　姨，大姐，工女，老婆口，和一般被指爲低級觀衆的，他們懂電影嗎？不，　他們沒有批評嗎？有的。也許他們可以批評某一部「民間故事」片故事不對，正因爲他　看過那部「民間故事」的木魚書，而使他們懂得那部「民間故事」未能把木魚書的精彩做出來。也推其不，得更多不能作更深的辨別和批評，所以才能對一般的粤語片發生興趣，這種「懂」的範圍是非常廣泛的。從一部片子的題材，演員，導演，佈景以至於細微的甩具，而至於工作者的態度，旣往的成績，技術的運用種種方面，懂得的越多，常識和專門的知識越多，批評才越有所根據，而批評的本身才越有價値。中國的影評，有許多是不大　電影的更不曾產生過權威的影評家。當然還另有原因，主要還是在「懂」得够不够的問題。</p>
<p>第三，批評電影不能有偏見不能一概而論不能為宣傳所蒙蔽</p>
<p>批評電影不能爲宣傳所蒙蔽，批評者　本是個人，終歸不免是『我以爲怎樣』，但批評的態度必需是比較客觀而嚴肅的，不能有偏見。自的的愛　而批評好壞。比如我喜歡某一個明星，我喜歡某一類影片，其部片子是大導演的作品，某個人是不可救藥的。這些只能作批評的參考，不能作批　的根據。名導演常有不足取的作品，小演員常有了不得的演技。批評電影不能一概而論：　如，中國電影不如外國電影，但不能一筆抹煞而說中國電影沒有希望。美國雖然有好的電影，但好來場實在低能得很，金元造成了一切，他們有限的成功，不足以補　他們浩大的消費。好的出品最多也不到百分之二十。中國電影固然差得太遠，但中國電影的一點成就，是從貧困難苦中掙扎出來的。資本的的微小械機的落伍，它的成就可以說已經超過了消費，以好來塢一部偉大出品的資金，差不多可以收買全中國電影公司而有餘，假如批評這兩國度的出品，當然不能用一的看法，「概而論，比如現在上海的製片組織，能够製作歸有意義的出品，或香港的影片公司能够產生較好的片子。批評者是應該給他們高度評價的。其次批評者要有些別力不能爲宣傳政策所蒙蔽，現代電影的宣傳政策驚人的，最賣錢的片子，不一定是很好片子，而常常是「轟動性的片子。」觀衆就常常被宣傳的轟動性所影響？而去看一部片子，轟動性的片子不一定就是好片子，　有時甚至影響觀者不能辨別，而以它確是好片子。這是批評電影所最爲注意的幾點，絕不能受了心　下的影響，而人舊亦云，比如某一部古裝片在繼力鋪張它佈景偉大，　大倒不是壞事，但假如沒有考據而偉大到莫明其妙，批評者是心加以辯別了的。</p>
<p>第四，批評電影必需有獨到的見解</p>
<p>批評一部片子的好壞，無論從他內容所表現的意義上或者技巧的成就上來立論，主要的，都是要有獨到的見解，要能深入，才能成爲有價値的批評。僅塡鴨式的用導演技巧如何，演員是否老練，攝影是否優美，等等字眼來批評，實在不夠表現，譬如你能够指出一部片子的缺點，固然是好，　如你更能够說明怎樣可以補這個缺點，豈不更好。</p>
<p>劇協歡迎夏衍座談會</p>
<p>今晚七時在華南中學舉行</p>
<p>香港靑年戲劇協會是港九二十多個靑年戲劇團體的統一組織。活潑的姿態流露着靑年的熱力，同時亦象徵着劇運的光明前途。此次熱烈歡迎中救劇團之後，接着又定於今日（十六）下午七時舉行歡迎該會顧問夏衍先生座談會，將研討「中國現階段戲劇運動」一劇本創作』，及「香港戰劇運動新展望」等問題。並邀請蔡楚生，司徒慧敏諸先生參加討論，屆時必有一番熱烈之盛况，聞該會歡迎愛好戲劇者出席參加云。</p>
<p>第一劇團新生</p>
<p>定十八日正式成立</p>
<p>廣東戲劇協會是南國新開的戲劇花朵，由廣州二十多個戲劇團體組合成的，會員擁有五百多人，胡春冰，趙如琳，鍾啓南，羅海沙等是該會熱心領導者。</p>
<p>廣州失陷之後，這五百多個戲劇工作者就散到各十去工作，有的是隨軍服務去。有一部份抵港的會員，爲着繼續工作，去年歲暮，就組成了「廣東戲劇協會留港同人會，」在艱辛中仍努力推動工作的發展。</p>
<p>嶄新而具體的表現，就是將原日廣東戲劇協會理事會議决組織的『第一劇團』在胡冰春·唐叔明夫婦領導之下，重新復活起來。這可說是劇運的一支熱流。</p>
<p>現該團團址已擇定，幷定於本月十八日星期三下午一時舉行成立典禮，俾得迅速開展工作。聽說預備第一次公演的名劇有胡春冰的「中國男兒」夏衍的「一年間」尤競的「上海屋　下」和，「慾魔」，『欽差大臣』「大電雨」等名劇。從跑火下出來的工作者，相信必會好好地幹着。我們謹以最誠懇的敬意，祝他們的新生和長成！</p>
<p>兒童劇協成立</p>
<p>十七晚行成立典禮</p>
<p>香港兒童戲劇協進會是本港各兒童戲劇的最高統一組織。負有聯絡各劇團感情與推進兒童劇運發展之兩大使命。經過螞蟻，先鋒，强中，中央，學賑，靑年同樂等兒童劇團積極籌備以來，各項進行，大體就緒。經定於本月十七日下午七時，在砵崙街中央女子學校舉行成立典禮，前因環境關係，一延再延之「兒童萬歲」大公演，亦將可與觀衆見面。査該會組織，全體大會之下設理事會及顧問，常務理事之不再分五部，（一）總務部分有文書，理財，交際，事務等股。（二）組織部分有交通，聯誼。調査，登記等股。（三）劇務部設幹事四人。（四）研究部分有編纂，技術，座談，圖書等股。宣傳部分有出版，美術，雜技，，歌詠等股·新的兒童劇運在最近的將來，必有一驚番人的成績表現。</p>
<p>「人類的呼聲」</p>
<p>日間開拍的英語片</p>
<p>國際公司與眞光公司合作攝製之第一部英語影片「人類的呼聲』，我們在前數期已一篇短文介紹。現在聽說該片日內卽將開拍，因英爲英語影片的攝製，尙是一種拓荒的工作。而參與此次工作者，向均以製作態度愼重著稱，且該片所取的題材，以及任何方面，都不失爲一「巨片」型，所以所費籌備期間特長，最主要的爲關於劇本方面的編撰，分幕，譒譯與修改工作　費時至久。而在英語片攝製上，尤有必需事先克服的種種困難，然後力能進行攝影場上的工作。聽說該片的職員方面：監製人爲羅明佑，製片主任黃國飲，編劇鍾石根，導演　　，技術主任黎民偉，攝影周達明；劇務方面工作則由裴冲，屠恒福，方梅超，童振民四人合作。主要演員為張翼，黎灼灼，陳雲裳，吳楚帆，盧敦諸人。該片係取材於抗戰中一个大的難民羣與侵略者，疫病，自私心的鬥爭，相許多不同的人物，表現一个　人的故事。頃聞已由導演人决定先往粉嶺拍難民生活場面。預計最低需時三四個月方能完成呢！</p>
<p>名劇「鳳凰城」</p>
<p>許多劇團都在排演</p>
<p>『鳳凰城』和『魔窟』是抗戰後產生的『劇作雙壁』，可是『鳳凰城』更値得讀美，因爲在描寫正面（魔窟主要的是反面）的抗戰劇本，她是很成熟的，而是把正確的理論是大衆的語言譜出來，經過了純熟的形象化的歷程</p>
<p>鳳凰城是靑年劇作家吳祖光描寫苗可秀在義勇軍中的英勇行動，及其殉國的　壯事跡的，他把一個偉大的難以處理的影村，很成功地寫成了這個劇本，在國　戲劇學校重慶上演的成績，更證明了她的舞台適應性。</p>
<p>生活書店把這劇本印出來以後，全國在爭着上演，香港華人文員協會，經李晨風氏導演外，中旅排着國語的，紅白劇團排着　語的，中旅已定于下　四五兩晚在皇后戲院義演其他亦都積極預備於最短期內演出。</p>
<h3>國立戲劇學校徵集話劇史料啟事</h3>
<p>話劇運動已經三十年了。在這三十年間·話劇在艱苦奮鬥中長成。那經過的史實，都應該留下賣貴的紀錄。一方面固然是追述戲劇界諸先進艱苦締造的功績，一方面也是　後起者作爲繼續奮鬥的借鏡。</p>
<p>關於話劇史料的搜集與編製，公家向未經營，雖有一二愛好戲劇者的努力，終以私人的精力財力所限，辦理或有本周。並且値此烽火瀰天的今日，對於史料的保藏與搜集，都感覺極端困難。所以本校鑒於當前形勢的艱危，特呈准敎育部組設「中國話劇運動史編纂委員食」正式從事於中國話劇運動史料的徵集編簒與印行。</p>
<p>在既往三十年間的話劇運動，已經有若干劇校，劇團，劇人，以及一般學校圑體的附帶從事戲劇活動者，他們對於戲劇無論表現於文字，活躍於舞台，都留下很多賣貴的成績。在這些成績裏，無論爲印件，鈔件，照片，甚至於當事者口頭的述說，都是話劇史上所應採取的資料。</p>
<p>現在史料的徵集工作，已經開始，希望全國今昔各公私立劇校，劇院，短期戲劇訓練班，愛美劇團，職業劇團，以及黨政軍敎育機關文化團體的流動宣傳隊，演劇團等，凡屬參與，劇活動者，都把成立的經過，組織的方式，經費的來源，工作的成績，技術上諸問題的解決方法，詳細地，正確地，函示我們。並且還要請求戲劇界諸先進，和各地主持話劇運動者，也都把個人倡導話劇的過程，翔實地函示或面示。尤其是關於話劇一切文件，如成立宣言，組織章程，計劃書，預算表，會議錄，工作報吿·紀念刊全體職演員名册，照片，簽名式，檔案，文件，戲劇書籍，（理論史話與劇本（戲劇刊物，（單行本，雜誌，期刊，或報紙，附載劇　）及演出時壁報，廣吿，票樣，說力書，特刊，舞台面，報紙期刊上尃號或附錄（演出的廣吿，報道，與批評，）以至一切與戲劇有關的文獻典籍，無論爲鉛印，石印，油印，鈔寫，攝影，剪報，不　以前的，現在的，完好的，汚損的，都熱望賜存，並代搜集或借閱。件寄重麽冉家巷十二號國立戲劇學校，中國話劇運動史編纂委員會」以便彙集起來編成一部豐富的中國話劇運動史稿，幸甚盼甚！</p>

<p>我華隊是屆確有包辦六大錦標的可能、這不是自己誇大、也不是在做夢、觀察現勢、祇要我們健兒努力到底、便可成功、若果包　得來、金甌無缺、這等偉業、的是光前俗後、</p>
<p>此項錦標賽、產生於一九二五年、銀杯則由英文星期報捐贈的、參加隊伍、以國籍爲限、起始卽有大中華　葡萄牙、英格蘭、蘇格蘭、四隊參與競爭、中途又增多愛爾蘭、威爾殊兩隊、本屆也還有中、葡、英、蘇、愛五隊共同角逐、决賽權則爲中、葡兩隊所得、在今天會師、一决雌雄、且看誰奪錦標歸、</p>
<p>比賽採九十分鐘制、故欲爭取勝利、球藝固要優良、氣力也須充沛、如缺一不足、都難以成事、本屆我華隊人材鼎盛、聚衆集軍、實力雄絕一時、乃能初戰而破蘇軍、　　而克英兵、再進一步、若於今天打坍葡隊、便卽蟬聯錦標云、</p>
<p>門票收入、概撥作慈善用途、球人出力、球迷出錢、可算各盡其責了、信得過今天午後的掃桿埔、萬人空巷、又展開一個熱鬧場面、惟須放睛、才不致影響收入、可得美滿的成績、</p>
<p>下午四時開火、如兩隊賽完九十分鐘的規定時間、尙成和　、則加賽二十分鐘、以决勝負、二時許便開始售票、球迷們欲得一良好座位、請提早到場、</p>

<p>生力軍、馬山兒、架地路、窩特、申都氏、</p>
<p>去年耶穌誕、葡隊初與愛隊交鋒、其時葡隊的陣容甚是完整、因前鋒線有小吿山奴及金氏効力、進展迅速、聯絡稠密、故能以七與一的大比數、把愛隊淘汰出局、可是現在小吿遠客厦門、金氏又隨東方南遊末歸、旣少了這兩位內鋒、進攻力必受影響、而大吿山奴或因輔助不得人、說不定有孤掌難嗚之嘆、</p>
<p>我華隊亦因東方南遊、而致缺去一二應選的人物、然整個陣線、似無孔漏、實力比葡隊强、勝利希望亦高</p>
<p>我華隊的前鋒線、是最理想的、李惠堂射門有把握、馮景祥盤運够工夫、黎兆榮讚營識門路、彼唱此和、無堅不摧、加以侯澄滔與鄧廣森的疾捷突擊、飛將軍如天上來、必會令到葡隊守將、防不勝防、</p>
<p>葡隊防衛方面、以比路度、雷米迪、麥士維路三人爲主力、但整個非完善、定沒法控制我華隊的前鋒線、不過、我可想像到比路度必採第三內衛防守法、以截阻惠堂、故惠堂亦應用調虎離山計、略爲退後、設法誘比路度出擊、而給予景祥及兆榮以乘時側擊之機、</p>
<p>大吿山奴是個危險份子、來頭必兇、然左右兩內錄非上駟材、與大吿必不甚默契、會弄到大吿孤軍無助、難以深入、惟大吿自有找尋出路的本領、非極力把他制時不可、</p>
<p>葡隊兩翼也矯捷、傳中衛不錯、故要提防他倆切中及大吿衝前的迎頭一擊、</p>
<p>總之、我華隊得勝是意中事、惟事關爭標的嚴重關頭仍須努力、經歷屆盟主表如、下（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>學習游泳常識</h3>
<p>— 潘叢紹</p>
<p>南國的四月天氣、又開始引誘人們到淸凉世界去、爲了學取一種護身之技、爲了增進康健、甚而追求水中之樂的、都一齊願意　進永消夏日的水裏去、但是、怎樣才能滿意達到所想象的、這就値得加以留意、紙上談兵、不動作水中的練習、斷不易成就的、假如從事水上運動外得其法、成效未見、我害先臨、這非故意駭人聽聞、「善泳者溺」屢見不鮮初學者所應具的游泳常識實屬必要、多少弄潮兒輕舉妄動、自貽其害、尤爲可惜、</p>
<p>游泳的方式很多、從其各不相同的動作上可分爲、（一）由泳（Craw　Ttro　a）又名捷泳、因爲這種泳式的動作是頂矯捷迅速的、（二）背泳（Back　Stroke）又稱仰泳、（三）胸泳（BreastStroke）亦叫俯泳或蛙式、以其泳姿很像蛙游的動作、與蛙泳動作略有不同的蝴蝶式近年來很流行、側泳、潛泳及其他但初學奢要按步就班、先從易　着手、還有入水絲習、這是　泳成功作進一步學習的頃目、對於游泳興趣的增進和泳術的應用的帮助很大、</p>
<p>胆大心細、這是游泳者至髙無上的安全保　、否則太危險了、先說胆大、初學者成績不優、原因可以概別爲三、（甲）練習時間的斷續和不充份、（乙）練習方法不佳、（丙）胆量太小、至於初學者怎樣才可戒除畏水的弱點、這得下个最大决心、乃濟于事、旣諳游泳而欲求進步的、那更需胆量大的幫忙　尤其入水的練習　如是胆小鼠的、簡直無從着手</p>
<p>許多正在準備畢習游泳的、很想曉得怎樣才算學得上手、關於這問題、我好在此說明、第、浮體已有把握、第二、動作能把身體推進、第三、呼吸舒暢、能够達到上述條件、就使泳術還很幼稚、已把深造的基礎建立起來了、游泳呼吸動作的重要、不但初學者每多忽略、許多已諳的亦不曉得求其改進之這、爲的是呼吸是游泳動作得以持久的先决條件、</p>
<p>關於游泳在水中、未下水前、跟出水後該注意的、分別略作一般的提供、其中多是每易犯着的惡習、卽其好作水上運動的亦未能免、影　所及、不僅健康有損而已、</p>
<p>（A）入水前——不妨先從游泳衣說起、泳衣的種式很多、特別是女性穿用的、花樣百出、對它選用、還是以線織的好、價廉耐用、又很輕便、毛製的雖易疏水、復有溫體的好處、但其增加所附水量的累贅、很覺不便　所以選用泳衣時要注意是否輕便適體、否則輙易阻碍游泳的動作、其次、泳帽的戴用、泳者所以要戴泳帽、並不是有什麽護頭的作用、又不是參加水球比賽、以資識別、顯明的乃爲包髮之用、假如慣用泳帽而忽把它脫掉了、馬上感覺得水髮夾掩眼前之苦、還是不戴泳相的好、</p>
<p>再其次、果眞下水去了、得先把四肢以水澆擦一遍　預防肌膚驟比體温低些的刺激、那是所謂抽筋的一種原因、多少泳者若剛飽吃過了東西或經長途步行、體温劇增的、也切不要卽下水、又若游泳于沒有設備的地方、還得察看一番、水質是否太汚、水流是否太急、有沒有浮游着的東西　然後可下水、惟初學者總以績習於游泳場爲宜、</p>
<p>（B）在水中——許多人在游泳中感覺頭痛、如沒有其他原因、就是受了陽光的刺激、若以水濕髮、便可無事、但有游泳而不濕髮、顯然是畏水、最低限度也是個害怕水的衝刺五官者、若愈圖規避、愈使動作運用不靈、所以頻以手抹臉眼的、又是惡習之一、在以自來水爲源的泳池裏、隨便唾涎、公共衞生有碍、固不道德、但受水衝刺的口腔雖覺不安、總要忍着、否則可貴的唾液白　得太多、不特影響消化的能力、還易受着病菌的侵襲、因爲水質總難純潔、而胃液又弱了殺菌能的力　初習泳者、久未游泳的、和身體較弱的、不宜久沉水中、要常上岸休息　倘四肢冷硬、或覺疲倦、還是出水休息才是、任是怎樣髙明的潛水者、設貿然而至入水台前的正中、眞是危險得很、又多舉一點要注意的事、貪便在水中便溺、千萬不可、這會弄到下部生出毛病來、</p>
<p>（C）出水後——沐浴更衣、肚子餓了、如要進食、請別多飲汽水之類、先以潔手漱口　藍非憚煩的事、耳部給水衝進去、要設法使它消出來、這很簡便、以足尖頻躍、側着頭部、水就會出來了、要是水質太劣　泳罷把眼睛消毒、也是一老緊要的事、</p>
<p>怎樣練習游泳呢、捷泳胸泳、背泳、潛泳、以至入水的話、下回續談、</p>

<h3>魂繞江門樹</h3>
<p>— 健彬</p>
<p>瀋陽事變後沒有幾天，我獨個兒悄悄地到了滘頭，這優美恬静的小鄉村·就在江門對岸，那兒有阡陌相連的稻田，有矮矮的山崗，有小溪潤，有樹林，還有我的生活所寄託的一所師範學校，那時救亡的熱流，正流遍了每個同學的心底，激盪着，掀起了抗日的髙潮。我們散佈在新會縣每一個角落裏，奔走呼號，在搖旗，在吶喊，把抗敵的種子向四方八面散播。隨着政府的屈服退讓，我們被迫着拋棄了可愛的工作，重返課室，對着生疏了的敎育學鑽研。沉悶的氣氛，咬嚙着我們的心，就在那段時間裏·我認識了幾個英勇的靑年伙伴，我們把生活打成了一片，幾個人一條心，企圖繼續那未了的志願。不斷的閱讀救亡書本，早晨裏練習爬山跑步，每星期還有一次絕食，打算靠了這些訓練，把自己壯健起來。那時我們跑步的地段，一天比一天拉得更長，一千米突，二千三千……，滘頭附近跑遍了，渡河往江門，沿了公路向化角，新會　作長途跑步，雖然在寒風凜烈中奔走是一件苦事，却是精神上感覺十分快慰、每天跑畢歸來，爬上矮矮的山崗上，向遠處公路瞭望着，低下頭來向脚底的江流凝想，夢想着不久的將來，一隊義勇軍就會像奇蹟似的突然出現於目前，我們馬上參加隊伍，踏上救亡大道，多麽令人興奮啊！這消息我們一天一天祈待着，還是不曾到來。一二八過了，淞滬協定成立了，我們幼稚的心靈，隨著沉悶的局勢，一天一天冷落下去，終于挨到暑假，到被派往中心小學實習，冷落了，一切熱烈的盼望都成了空想的時候，不論滘頭·江門·北街·新會城·我們疾步踐踏過的公路，仍然靜悄悄地臥着，偶然也不過揚起一陣汽車引起的烟塵，惹起我們一聲嗟嘆而已，</p>
<p>畢業了，我們各自星散，有些北上參加廿九軍，有些分發鄉公所任職，有些仍然敎學，我自已也遠遠的跑到上海去念書，過着靡爛的大學生活。</p>
<p>今天，江門的爭奪戰終於爆發了，我們幷日站立凝想的小山崗，我們揮汗疾走的公路，我們冒着寒風游泳的河流，我們躺着閱讀救亡書本的稻草堆……都成了戰場，每一方寸地，都塗着血跡·滘頭，江門，北街，新會城，我們稔熟的地帶，我們訓練的場所，每一條馬路都成爲戰壕，每一聞房子都成了堡壘，我們八年前熱烈祈望着的幻想，今終於於實現了，不同的只是戰場已由北而南，烽火燃遍了廣東，不同的只是英勇的鬥士，已不限於幾個爬山跑步的少年夥子，轉而爲廣大的勞苦大衆了。</p>
<h3>關於民族英雄傳記的寫作</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>關於民族英雄傳記的寫作，現在大家都認爲很需要的，因爲他一方面不但可以發揚我們先民所表示的民挨的人格，一方面可以激勵我們後生今日對於民族應有的認識。這種寫作，當然以大衆爲對象，所以他的寫作，第一應用大衆所能瞭解的文字，不能從古史上抄錄一些就算；第二必須根據可靠的材料編寫，不能把材料加以曲解，如演義小說加入無謂的神怪故事；第三必須加以簡要注釋，如地名官名之類，免得讀者讀了有所隔閡。我近來因爲搜集一些這方面的材料，可惜都使我覺得有些欠妥的地方，茲敢略抒鄙見，與讚者諸君一加商榷。</p>
<p>第一，我所謂應用大衆所瞭解的文字，這在現在所已出版的民族英雄傳能諸書，都已沒有問題，只有商務一套「少年叢書」，仍是用文言寫的，那是因爲出版日期猶在民國初年，無怪如此，不過像易君左所寫「文天祥」與「史可法」二書（新生命出版），關於對話部分，仍引用原文，不加譯解，這實在是很不當的。譬如「文天祥」中考官王應麟看了文天祥的試卷，對帝有云：「是卷古誼若龜鑑忠肝如鐵石。」「忠肝如鐵石」或者還可瞭解，「古誼若龜鑑」，試問大衆如何能懂？不過將文言譯爲白話，有時候的確也是很困難的，所以我以為像這種地方，我們只寫其大意，不必定要照原文對譯。同時用語體寫作，也不能過於文藝化，如吳曙天所寫的「岳飛」（兒童出版），開首寫太陽烏鵝，頗具詩意，這在一般大衆看來，也並不感到興趣。况目故事本身是轟轟烈烈的，我以爲不妨開門見山，熱閙上場，此柳富有詩意的環境，實在不能引起讀者的情緒。正如一齣戰事劇本，開幕却是一場美麗花園佈景，總覺得有些大不對勁罷！</p>
<p>第二，我所謂必須根據可靠的材料編寫，這本來是不成問題的，但問題却在把可靠的材料，有的仍有誤解的地方，譬如章衣萍的『天文祥』（兒童出版）在『京口逃難』一節中說，『天祥跟着元軍一路行去，舟過錢塘。看見西湖山水如畫，不禁悲從中來，淚下如雨，後過吳門，至京口。』按天祥時在臨安，（今杭州）北皐亭山元營，被伯顏强迫北行，此行實由運河而北，故過吳門，（今蘇州）而至京口（今鎭江）旣在臨安之北起程，則天祥如何能再見『西湖山水如書』？宋史中並無此語，却被章君誤拉進去了，又同節說『那個監押天祥的人，名字叫做王千戶，』按千戶係官職名，並非名字，此種也是誤解，與原意大相差異，又如易君左的『文天祥，』也有同樣誤處，如說，『景定元年，朝延封他做鎭南軍節度』按劉岳申文丞相傳原云。『授寗海軍節度判官應公事。天祥上書乞斬董宋臣，不報，自免歸。以前職於鎭南軍』是鎭南軍亦爲節度判官廳公事，非節度也，且此非封爵，只是除官，亦不能稱之爲『封』，再如央曙天的『岳飛』，在他『洞庭湖大戰中，竟誤『張浚爲張俊，更可謂疏忽之至不知浚俊原係兩人，豈可混爲一談。又張浚時爲都督諸諮軍馬，岳飛不過一員大將，以今日形勢譬之，一是總司令，一是軍長，軍長對司令自有尊卑之分。但吳君寫岳飛對張浚說話，却是：「用不着，你只要留兵八天，我包管盪平洞庭湖。」按宋史飛本傳，則謂：「已有定畫。都督能少留，不八日可破賊。」明明是稱都督而不用汝，被她改用一個「你」字，直如命令式的，這實在不成爲對上說話的語氣了。</p>
<p>第三我所謂必須加以簡單的注釋，原因是古今名稱不同，非加以注釋，實難使大衆瞭解。譬如岳飛討李成一節，李成遺將進犯「洪州」。這洪州在現在地圖上是沒有的，若加注釋「卽今江西南昌」，豈非使讀者更易於明瞭？又如上面所舉文天祥爲「寗海軍節度判官廳公事」，這在現在也沒有這種官名，我們不妨簡要的說，這是專管文讀會計的官。可惜我們所看到的諸書，大多沒有顧到這些，尤其是官名，都不加以注釋。</p>
<p>以上所說，只就伽人管見，所列諸書，也只是隨便舉例，如有冒眛之處，務請原作者與讀者原加以諒！</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>在高遙的空闊間的雲雪中，透出模糊的月痕；月下，依舊定過着稀薄的雲片，飛落若雪，從雲雪的縫隙間，透落下來的淸淡的月光，彷彿在引導他和她走出停留已久的黑暗的牆邊。</p>
<p>不過，她還向他說：</p>
<p>『你必須答應我一個條件，保障我的安全。』</p>
<p>『我絕對可以答應你！』</p>
<p>於是，她隨他走起路來，走了幾步，她又停下，急迫地向他：</p>
<p>『你要吿訴我，什麽時候放我囘來呀？』</p>
<p>『你家什麽時候送錢來，就什麼時候放你回去。』</p>
<p>『我爸爸是愛錢的，如果他永遠不送錢來呢？』</p>
<p>『那我也絕對放你囘去！』</p>
<p>『多久？』</p>
<p>他愼重地考慮一下說：</p>
<p>『兩個月以內。』</p>
<p>『不，兩個月太久了！最多一個月，你答應我嗎？』</p>
<p>『答應你！」</p>
<p>然後，她又隨他走起未盡的雪路，現在，他和她已經成爲兩偭自由結合的行旅者了。不久，由黑暗中轉到明亮些的路上；路旁商店的燈光，誘惑她和他不時地相望，每當雙方視線相觸的時候，立刻又各自避開，隨便把視線移至某一視點；過了些時，各自冉把視線偷偷地移向對方去，好像要問一句：</p>
<p>『你心在想什麽呢？』　（卅八）</p>
<h3>荒郊外</h3>
<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>迎着一陣蕭瑟的寒氣，奔下山坡，已經是初春的季候，怎麽原野上仍是僵凝着，沒萌團綠意？陰森的，凄凉的，一陣風，吹動墓頭草，還會發出恐怖的尖音。</p>
<p>停住了步子，遙望荒塚：那些凌亂的殘草，衰枯的荊棘，交織成了一幅黃色地毯，鋪展開來；墓碑倒在那襄，荒冷沉靜的一片，沒有人憑弔，也沒有詩人來吟咏</p>
<p>「就在這裏吧！荒塚當作堡壘·棺槨當作槍架，可以對着前面的公路」。</p>
<p>說這話的老强，立刻揮動泥鍪，像挖饅頭似的輕易，挖出了正尺對徑一洞穴。身軀攢了進去，靜待着，把住機關槍桿向一個小孔外怒視着！我們把挖出來的泥土殘草壓平了之後，也一個快步，就穿過了叢林。</p>
<p>這個地帶是被認爲「掃蕩」了的，空氣裏的火藥味也似乎消失了。××多麼得意，在彎曲如長蛇的公路上蠕動着，那零落的黑影，就像野狗在覓食，把伏在荒塚裏的老强，望得眼睛裏發火，然而，他又祇好忍耐地屏息着，讓時間靜悄悄地逝去。由侵晨到中午，又到黃昏，他像一雙伏在繭中的蠶，那麽的潛藏着，牢記隊長的訓話：——鬼子認爲這地帶是被「掃蕩」了的，等到戒備鬆弛，估計得能够符合我們殲滅的量，就幹！</p>
<p>零落的鬼影，惹動他的怒火，不知道有多少次，終會因重温訓話，而抑壓下；繼續等待。注望，估計，延候到幾十個小時。</p>
<p>時間是快到第二天的黃昏了。</p>
<p>在沉靜的薄暮中，公路上傳來一陣喧囂，三個蓄八字鬍　，載金絲眼鏡的××，騎着髙馬來了，指揮刀閃動出燦爛的銀光，得意而傲慢地，後面拖帶着一大群。摩托在公路上顚簸，樣子很沉重，大概是　的軍火吧？</p>
<p>這時候，老强估計得發笑了：憤怒之火燃燒起來，劇烈而迅捷的，通過了他底全身：把住機關槍——一格格格……一勇猛地掃射一陣。</p>
<p>八字鬍鬢·金絲眼鏡的人，立刻翻下馬，接速地倒下去，汚血飛濺滿地。後面沒死的××，都　駭得發呆了，慌忙向四周亂射一陣，天空裏就縱横交錯，組成了一個火網，籠罩着空曠的荒郊。</p>
<p>××也許在懷疑吧？這是人間，還是夢境？張眼瞭望，曠野裏祇有沉靜如死的叢林和荒塚，並沒有人。</p>
<p>當他們跑步向叢林中圍攻時，老强却笑痛了肚皮，側臥下來吃乾糧。</p>
<p>一陣奔跑，老强又一陣掃射，火網下××，也不知道倒了多少。</p>
<p>夜色漸漸地深沉，撲空的××　，依舊是驚嚇焦急，；發怒他們仗着精銳的器械來發揮其毀壞的威力了：——轟……通……冬……山砲震動了整個　野，火燄在乾枯的亂草地上蔓延着；老强的熱血也跟着沸騰了，但他却更鎭靜地撫摸着機槍柄：格格格格格……接着又大笑起來。</p>

<h3>The Black Market Exchange Rate Under Exchange Equalization</h3>
<p>— Zhang Liu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Liu is a pen name of a certain economist, and he is respected for his familiarity with the financial market. This article is a powerful prediction of the future of the black market for foreign exchange. Those concerned about this issue should pay attention. — Editor</p>
<p>1.  The Exchange Equalization Fund and the Black Market</p>
<p>The Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has been established in Hong Kong. The so-called equalization fund is of course to equalize the exchange rate of the legal tender. However, there are actually two exchange rates in China now: one is the official rate quoted by the Central Bank, and the other is the private rate in the black market. Then, what exchange rate will the Exchange Equalization Fund implement in the future? The official rate or the private rate?</p>
<p>Based on the following reasons, we assume that the exchange rate to be equalized in the future will be the private rate, not the official rate, because:</p>
<p>First, the exchange rate of the Central Bank has been extremely stable so far, with no changes to the original rate, so there is no need for equalization at all. Moreover, since the currency reform, the government has had special funds for the equalization fund in London and New York. After the emergence of the black market, the Bank of China also came out to adjust it (see Mr. Song Ziwen's remarks). Comparing the black market exchange rate at that time with the later exchange rate, it can be seen that China's foreign exchange equalization fund has been profitable without loss. In other words, China's foreign exchange fund may not have increased after the war, but it will definitely not suffer losses. In this way, there is no need to replenish the foreign exchange fund. The fund set up this time is naturally for equalizing the black market.</p>
<p>Second, this is based on the existence of the black market exchange rate. Because if the black market does not exist, then there is only one exchange rate, so naturally there is no need to ask which one to equalize. In reality, if British and American banks are determined and willing to help China's national banks to eliminate the black market, it seems not impossible. However, in the current market situation, since they can easily obtain Chinese goods worth one yuan for eight pence, why must they be foolish enough to exchange them at the official rate of one shilling and two and a half pence?</p>
<p>Third, when the foreign exchange fund was established, the London side issued a statement, believing that it was beneficial to British commerce. And the current trade of various countries is almost concentrated in the black market, so the so-called benefit naturally also refers to the black market. Judging from the position of the committee banks: HSBC and Jardine Matheson are commercial banks. Although the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are both known as national banks like the Central Bank, they also occupy an important position in commercial banks. If it is to equalize the official rate, then there should be the Central Bank included. Again, judging from the location of its establishment, if it is China's foreign exchange agency, the headquarters should be set up in Chongqing, and Hong Kong should be an office. However, the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee was clearly originated in London and places its focus on Hong Kong, so its equalization goal must also be to stabilize the black market and facilitate Sino-British trade, no doubt.</p>
<p>2.  Nine Pence? Or Eight Pence?</p>
<p>Since there has been a black market for foreign exchange, the market price has generally been declining, from the initial one shilling and two and a half pence to about eight pence and twenty-five recently. However, there is a special feature in between, that is, in the past three months, the market price has been particularly stable. The trend of its stability, observed from experience: (1) When there is a large amount of release, Jardine Matheson and HSBC are often the absorbers; (2) When the position is very tight, Jardine Matheson and HSBC are often the suppliers; (3) After the market price extends beyond eight pence and twenty-five, it will soon return to eight pence and twenty-five; and if the market price shrinks below eight pence and twenty-five, it will soon be balanced above eight pence and twenty-five. From points (1) and (2), it is clear that HSBC and Jardine Matheson are actually undertaking the work of equalizing the exchange market. From point (3), it is clear that the standard in the foreign exchange black market has been stabilized above eight pence and twenty-five.</p>
<p>After the news of the Foreign Exchange Fund came out, I realized that Jardine Matheson and HSBC were originally responsible members of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. Then, what will be the future standard of balance in the black market?</p>
<p>(1) It is said that it will be raised to nine pence. The reason is that the exchange rate of eight and a half pence or eight pence and twenty-five is too far from the statutory official rate. Shanghai foreign firms and import and export firms are rumored to have requested to be given foreign exchange at nine pence. The level of eight pence and twenty-five has been stable for several months. If it is allowed to be released for a long time, it will immediately give the financial market a contraction effect. Therefore, starting from the current rate, it is most likely to raise the exchange rate to nine pence.</p>
<p>(2) There is also a saying that the exchange market will not move and will always be stable above the current price of eight pence and twenty-five. The reason is that the current price has been stable for several months, and the stimulus caused by the depreciation of the exchange rate has given Shanghai the benefit of raising prices, resulting in a special boom. If various countries want to support trade, they must maintain this boom, which is to maintain the level of low exchange rates.</p>
<p>(3) There is also a saying that the foreign exchange black market will have no level of ups and downs in the future. The task of the Foreign Exchange Committee is to stabilize the foreign exchange black market, but not to supply the foreign exchange black market. Therefore, the Foreign Exchange Committee will not care about whether British merchants can obtain foreign exchange at the market price of nine pence in the future, and will ignore other merchants. At the same time, the method of "absorbing as much as possible when there is a large position, and throwing out to a certain extent when there is a small position" is still used to stabilize the exchange market for foreign exchange trading in the black market.</p>
<p>The above three statements have some reasons and some possibilities. It is not yet clear from the recent market situation what method the authorities will adopt. However, a few points can be determined in advance: First, it is generally impossible for the foreign exchange black market to shrink further. Second, the Foreign Exchange Fund Committee will directly participate in the foreign exchange black market. Or use a certain standard, but not necessarily maintain a certain standard.</p>
<p>3.  The Future of the Black Market and the Official Rate</p>
<p>Some people have long advocated lowering the official rate, in other words, abolishing the official rate and complying with the black market. This proposal has not been realized and has never been realized. If it is realized, it will be harmful and not beneficial to China. If the official rate is abolished, it is tantamount to stating that the government has no sincerity in maintaining the original exchange rate. At the same time, the informal exchange rate in the black market is given legal recognition by abolishing the official rate, so it has never been implemented in fact.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of the essence of the foreign exchange equalization fund, there are very few advantages to maintaining the black market price through foreign exchange equalization. Because the occurrence of the foreign exchange black market is due to China's management of foreign exchange. If the black market can be given whatever it wants, then why manage foreign exchange during the war?</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it is ultimately beneficial to China. The increase in the foreign exchange equalization fund indicates that China's monetary base is becoming more and more consolidated; at the same time, since the committee is handled by Chinese and British experts, it will certainly not be used by third countries.</p>
<h3>World Trends in a Week</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From April 9th to April 15th</p>
<p>1939 is a year of storms, and April 1939 is even more a month of storms, with gales, showers, thunder, lightning, plus unprecedented darkness and stench.</p>
<p>Albania has been annexed again, sacrificed to Italy's crazy aggression and the non-interventionist policies of Britain and France! After the fall of Albania, the Balkan countries are naturally in a precarious situation, and all of Europe and even Latin America can no longer fantasize about peace without resistance. However, are the anti-aggression steps taken by Britain, France, and the United States sufficient to stop the escalating world crisis?</p>
<p>The Eastern aggressors, at a time when the European situation is critical, are rushing to convene a meeting of senior officials, on the one hand, to intensify their steps to attack China, and on the other hand, to implement their old trick of "taking advantage of the fire" against Britain and France! China's resistance war has had more significant developments this week, but what countermeasures will Britain and France take against the Far East crisis?</p>
<p>(1) The Fall of Albania Makes the World Crisis More Urgent</p>
<p>Albania, under the large-scale attack of Italy, finally fell due to being outnumbered. Italian troops landed on the 7th, entered the Albanian capital Tirana on the 8th, and started to organize a puppet regime on the 9th. So far, Europe has lost another independent small country, and the aggressors have completed part of the plan to transform the world map.</p>
<p>Albania, with its small country and small population, and its extremely poor military strength, was still able to resolutely resist the large-scale offensive of the powerful enemy's naval and air forces. It repeatedly repelled the enemy troops in places such as the Port of Razzo, and Albanian hunters and people from all walks of life also actively participated in the war of resistance. The two Albanian princes are still leading the armed anti-aggression struggle. This kind of national spirit can guarantee the possibility of its future restoration. We should give it unlimited sympathy and blessings.</p>
<p>After the fall of Albania, Yugoslavia and Greece were directly threatened, and the entire Balkans was also shaken. Moreover, the collusion of the Italian and German aggressors has further increased the threat to Poland, Romania, and even the entire Europe. Conversely, on the aggressor's side, after Italy occupied Albania, it can completely monopolize the Adriatic Sea at sea, blocking Yugoslavia's maritime communication with Britain and France, and enhancing its position in the Eastern Mediterranean; on land, it has obtained a base for invading the Balkan countries, and cooperate with Germany's future military operations in Southeast Europe. German and Italian forces are increasing in Spain, and they already have the potential to dominate the Western Mediterranean; now that Italy has occupied Albania, it can complete the plan of Germany and Italy to establish an advantage in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy's second step has already begun! On the 9th, the Moscow News' Rome reporter reported: Italian troops will soon occupy the southern border and coast to launch a wider offensive against British and French territories. On the 10th, the London Times' Rome correspondent reported: Germany and Italy attempted to seize the Aegean Sea and further force Romania to cede Black Sea ports. On the 13th, the Paris Evening News and the London Daily Evening News also reported: Italy is preparing to secretly agree with Yugoslavia to divide the Balkans and plan to organize an independent state of Macedonia. American politicians further pointed out: Germany and Italy's goal is not only to include the Balkans, but also to continue to hold meetings after the anti-aggression group has enriched its ranks to test whether Britain and France have the determination to resist. Berlin has also revealed further German and Italian aggression plans: to control all small countries and divide Central Europe equally, such as forcing Poland to join the Axis and Romania and Hungary to be controlled by Germany. Due to internal crises, Germany and Italy urgently took military speculative risks, taking the invasion of small countries as the first step in attacking Britain and France. In reality, the world war has reached a more serious stage.</p>
<p>(2) Small Countries Panic and Flounder, Britain and France Issue Declarations Again</p>
<p>Since the fascist aggressors' crazy adventure to advance the world war is as described above, what are the expressions of democratic and peaceful countries?</p>
<p>First, all the small countries that have become direct annexation targets, although there are currently signs of "panic and fluttering," most of them are unwilling to surrender in humiliation and are preparing to unite and resist. Greece, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, etc. have all implemented partial mobilization in preparation for emergencies. The anti-aggression sentiment of Near Eastern Islamic countries and Muslims around the world is extremely high. In Turkey, Syria, Palestine, and even North Africa, there have been enthusiastic anti-Italian demonstrations in the past week. Romania and Turkey ended talks on the 10th and have agreed to work together to maintain the safety and independence of the two countries. There will also be important talks between Romania and Southern countries in the coming days. However, if Britain and France do not actively unite these small countries, establish a collective security policy, and resolutely resist aggression, then all small countries will inevitably be defeated individually, and then Britain and France themselves will be affected!</p>
<p>Second, Britain and France have also been forced to take various steps to resist aggression. British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier simultaneously issued declarations on the 13th, stating the positions of the two countries on the current European situation. The main points of Chamberlain's declaration are: (1) The British Empire is determined to use its utmost efforts to prevent anything that attempts to disrupt the status quo in the Mediterranean or the Balkan Peninsula through threats or force; (2) Guarantee the independence of Greece and Romania; (3) Do not issue the Anglo-Italian Agreement; (4) Still have contact with Soviet Russia; (5) Call on peaceful countries to unite and resist aggression. Daladier's declaration is roughly the same, and the main points are: (1) The French government has taken military measures to defend its territory; (2) Maintain contact with Wu Meisu Bo Tu Luonan Greece and other countries to maintain peace; (3) Guarantee the integrity of Romania and Greece; (4) France and Poland implement mutual assistance based on the alliance treaty. This kind of declaration by Britain and France has extremely important significance, especially the courage to openly declare the determination to unite with the Soviet Union and other peaceful countries to resist the aggressors. However, in order to truly exert the effect of stopping aggression, it still depends on truly implementing a collective security policy, effectively uniting the Soviet Union and the United States, uniting all small countries, sanctioning aggressive countries, and striving for a long-term overall peace. Members of the British Parliament have unanimously demanded that Britain and the Soviet Union cooperate effectively, and the French people are also demanding the same enthusiastically.</p>
<p>(3) Close Cooperation Between the United States and the Soviet Union Strengthens the Peace Front</p>
<p>The anti-aggression movements of the United States and the Soviet Union have recently made new progress. US President Roosevelt published an important speech in the "Washington Post" on the 11th, warning aggressive countries, he said: "If totalitarian countries truly cause war, at the beginning of their actions, there will be a country that is more powerful than the combined forces of Germany and Italy, which will be involved." American newspapers also unanimously pointed out that Luo's article means: "If a great war breaks out, the United States cannot turn a blind eye." American officials also unanimously supported it, believing that "it correctly shows the attitude of the American government and people towards the situation." On the 14th, US Secretary of State Hull broadcast to the world, emphasizing that the entire American nation has the determination and courage to resist aggressive countries. And recently, the movement of government officials and people to aid China and curb Japan is even more enthusiastic. Democratic Congressman Fuchs and former Republican Speaker of the House Tilson have made important suggestions and have gained support.</p>
<p>As for the friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the Soviet Union and China, there has recently been significant progress. The Soviet naval investigation team has arrived in Washington to conduct important talks on naval cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. The US Department of Commerce also used trade figures with the Soviet Union to prove the Soviet Union's industrial density and the strengthening of its national defense industry. At the same time, American diplomatic observers also unanimously pointed out: The Soviet Union's Far East policy will definitely be strengthened, and aid to China will also be intensified. The reasons are: (1) The Soviet Union has now completed the work of purging the party and the army, and there is no need to worry about internal affairs during wartime; (2) The efficiency of the Soviet Union's national defense procedures has exceeded general expectations; (3) Soviet strategists firmly believe that defending both eastern and western borders at the same time can be successful. In addition, the Associated Press Washington telegram on the 12th also reported the recent remarks of a Soviet spokesperson, saying: "The Soviet Union must and has been preparing for self-defense in both Europe and Asia at the same time; because the Axis countries are full of tricks and will inevitably echo each other east and west."</p>
<p>The determination, courage, and strength of the United States and the Soviet Union to resolutely resist the aggressors, and the progress in the friendly relations between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China will definitely increase the fighting spirit of peace and justice-loving people all over the world. Even Britain and France, for the Soviet Union, have been forced by the situation to attach importance to its power to protect peace, and are constantly conducting negotiations on various relationship issues. People of insight in Britain and France are also urging the government to unite with the Soviet Union and expand the peace front: Liberal Party leader Lloyd George gave a speech on the 12th, urging Chamberlain to quickly establish effective military cooperation with the Soviet Union; British Labour Party leader Attlee, Conservative Party leader Churchill, Liberal Party leader Sinclair, Labour MP Dalton, and even the Duke of Sutherland and the Marquis of Zetland, also urged the government in both houses of Parliament to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union as a guarantee for establishing an anti-aggression group.</p>
<p>As for the Far East, when the Governor of Singapore traveled to Annam and Siam in February, he suggested that Malaya, Singapore, Annam, Burma, and Siam should jointly sign a non-aggression pact to break Japan's instigation. Recently, it has been widely rumored that it has received "good reactions." We hope that Britain, France, and the United States will recognize the serious threat to all countries posed by Japan's invasion of China and the recent seizure of Hainan Island and the Xinnan Islands, and quickly unite with China and the Soviet Union, unite all small countries and oppressed nations, and jointly resist the aggressors, just as everyone in Europe is demanding.</p>
<p>(4) Full-Scale Counter-Offensive Launched, Optimistic Situation in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The competition between the two fronts of democratic and peaceful countries and fascist aggressors in the international arena has been fiercely launched. Our anti-Japanese war of justice to defend national independence and freedom and defend world peace has also had a more violent development.</p>
<p>First, look at the war situation. As the New York Min Sheng Pao's editorial on the 11th said, based on the observations of military strategists, "The Japanese army's difficulties are increasing, and the Chinese army's counter-offensive is gaining momentum, so the Japanese army's adventurous actions against China will reach an emergency." Since the fall of Wuhan, the Japanese army's difficulties in insufficient and dispersed troops have become increasingly prominent. Until the fall of Nanchang, the consumption of combat power was particularly significant. In addition, military difficulties and the need for a large number of troops in the country, Taiwan, Korea, and Northeast China made it difficult to replenish new troops. Although they have recently tried to carry out speculative adventures, their actual strength is extremely limited. Therefore, the current Japanese military strategy is: (1) to intensify the strengthening of the occupied areas; (2) to closely coordinate the "peace" and "anti-communist" movements; (3) to use the anti-communist and peace smoke screen to carry out military speculative adventures. As for the current strategy, it is (1) to intensify the opening of the Pinghan and Yuehan lines and strengthen the occupation of eastern China; (2) to implement military speculation in the northwest and southwest, and if the anti-communist and peace conspiracies make progress, they will immediately invade on a large scale.</p>
<p>In order to crush the Japanese's new strategy, we must thoroughly strike at the political conspiracies of Japanese traitors who oppose communism and seek peace. On the other hand, we must intensify the enhancement of the combat power of the front lines and widely launch guerrilla warfare behind the enemy.</p>
<p>In terms of military development, we have launched a full-scale general counter-offensive this week, from the Sui-Cha front in the north to the coast of the South China Sea in the south. What is most worthy of attention is: (1) In North China, it is reported that Fu Zuoyi's troops have entered Sui-Xi, and the military and political situation in Sui Province has suddenly become active; two divisions of pseudo-Mongolian cavalry have revolted one after another, and the military and civilians in the village are enthusiastically resisting the war. The Japanese army in Shanxi invaded Zhongtiao Mountain seven times, but all seven times were defeated. Ruicheng and Monan have now been recovered, and all important strongholds are in our hands. Our army in western and northwestern Shanxi has also launched counter-offensives one after another, which have been very successful. Guerrilla warfare in various parts of Ji-Lu is also continuing. (2) In Northeast China, the Eighth Route Army troops have penetrated into Guanwai and established contact with the anti-Japanese united forces in various places; recently, there has been a lot of rumors at Jinzhou and HuangguTung stations on the BeiNing Road. The four northeastern provinces have now been assigned to the ×th war zone, and ×× has been appointed as the commander. The guerrilla teams in the Jin-Yi-Sui area have been ordered to go out of Guan and launch a large-scale counter-offensive. (3) On the Longhai Line, the Eighth Route Army and the troops of Yu Xuezhong, Sun Dianying, and Sun Tongxuan are attacking Xuzhou and Kaifeng from both east and west. Kaifeng was immediately stormed by us on the 11th, and street fighting was still going on on the 12th and 13th; six members of the pseudo-Jing-Sui Committee were killed, and the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy losses. Foreign military observers also believe that "the Chinese army's first effective attack on the Japanese army's occupation of important cities." At the same time, a part of the Eighth Route Army, about 2,000 people, won a great victory northeast of Taierzhuang on the 12th. The counter-offensive against Xuzhou and the military in the Lu-Yu-Su border area is about to have new developments. (4) The counter-offensive military in Hubei and Henan provinces has also had considerable success this week. The Japanese army in the Zhongxiang area is being encircled and annihilated, and the Japanese army in Xinyang and other places has also been besieged by our army, suffering heavy losses. (5) On the battlefields inside the country, our army in northern Jiangsu took advantage of the victory to advance to Muyang and surround Huaiyin. Our army in Anhui attacked the Hefei area, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. More than 1,000 troops from the puppet army under Lu Jiayun revolted in full on the 9th. Our army in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi has also launched a large-scale counter-offensive in separate routes. And the suburbs of Nanjing have also been attacked again by our New Fourth Army. (6) In South China, a part of our army has captured Foshan, another part has captured Huaxian, and another part has captured Zengcheng in the east, and is now coordinating to advance on Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Due to the development of counter-offensives on various battlefields, the overall war situation has dramatically shifted to an advantageous position. Coupled with the political fact that the national generals, the national people, and the government authorities severely punished the traitor Wang Jingwei, and thoroughly cracked down on the "anti-communist peace" conspiracy, the future of our war of resistance and nation-building is brighter and more optimistic! However, at present, whether politically, militarily, or diplomatically, all our achievements have not reached the point where we can fatally strike the Japanese; the crisis within the Japanese, the crisis within the Japanese army, and the difficulties faced by all Japanese activities abroad have not developed to the point where they are unable to launch adventurous offensives, and the traitors and collaborators are intensifying their anti-communist peace conspiracy to serve the Japanese and harm our country and nation! Therefore, we must intensify the internal unity, the progress in military and politics, the enhancement of national self-esteem and self-confidence, and realize the general mobilization of all the strength of the national people, cooperate with the development of the international anti-aggression peace front, and thoroughly strike the Japanese traitors. Only in more arduous battles can we have our victorious peace!</p>
<h3>The New Fourth Army's Year of Anti-Japanese War: Experiences and Lessons (II)</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ying</p>
<p>Based on a year of combat, the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese can be divided into the following points: First, the Japanese tactics: 1. The Japanese tactics rely on constructing strongholds everywhere, building roads, and narrowing the scope of our activities. 2. Simultaneous advance and combined attacks, adopting surprise encirclements. 3. Lightly equipped advancement, facilitating rapid movement and surprise attacks. 4. Employing ambushes, using roads to ambush our troops. 5. Adopting concealed actions, easily detected during the day, acting at night, causing our vigilance to be lax, and troops easily attacked. They take small roads, not main roads. 6. Relying on firepower, using firepower to threaten the Japanese, suppressing the Japanese. Second, the Japanese advantages: 1. Accurate shooting. 2. Skilled in using terrain and objects for concealment and advancement. 3. Able to swim. 4. Rapid rescue of wounded and sick soldiers, quick collection of military supplies. 5. Tenacity due to the education of Bushido, the arbitrariness of warlords, deception, and propaganda, forming the tenacity of the Japanese army in combat. In the past, they would rather die than surrender, but now the degree has decreased, not as tenacious as before. 6. Various movements are in line with tactics, meeting the requirements of combat. 7. The officers are very strong, able to control the troops, and deploy quickly in combat. 8. The soldiers are highly obedient, advancing when told to advance, retreating when told to retreat, and able to regroup after being defeated. 9. Very strong ability to repair transportation. 10. Tactical application is very flexible, changing at any time. If they fail today, they will change tomorrow. Third, strategies to deal with us: 1. All important transportation lines, as well as the turning points of highways, are built with fortifications as strongholds. 2. Making barbed wire, using police dogs, and using mobile bridges for small rivers. 4. When marching or transporting, use small forces to occupy prominent positions first, concealing the advance, searching forward. 5. Camping locations are often changed. 6. Houses are dug with trenches and gun holes. 7. Use waterways for transportation to prevent our attacks. Fourth, the enemy's weaknesses: 1. Contempt for the enemy still exists, and vigilance is lax. 2. Lack of offensive spirit. 3. Awkward and slow movements. 3. Cannot endure labor, cannot march long distances. Forced marches, rapid marches. 5. Taking advantage of the failures of Chinese traitors and the uselessness and unreliability of puppet troops.</p>
<p>Experiences and Lessons of Civil Affairs Work</p>
<p>In the past year, both in the front and in the rear, in order to mobilize the masses and strengthen the strength of the anti-Japanese war, and to achieve cooperation between the military and the people, and with the support and help of the masses, we have been able to persist in the struggle in the difficult environment of Jiangnan. Therefore, since the establishment of our army, we have carried out mass movements anytime and anywhere. Although we, due to various objective conditions, at a certain time, in a certain stage, could not carry out mass work according to our own wishes, or even could not do mass work, for example, at the beginning of the establishment of our army, from reorganization to concentration, especially in the stage of concentration, we, in order to abide by the orders of our superiors, in order to avoid many misunderstandings, during this time, how could we say that we did not do mass work, until after our troops were deployed, and during combat, only in our own combat area, around our own troops, did we begin to carry out mass work. Our previous propaganda work was very little, and only at this time did we begin to carry it out, not only propaganda, but also from propaganda to organization, but even to this day, there are still some people who do not understand the importance of mass work, and do not understand how to achieve military-civilian cooperation. This not only fails to develop mass movements on the surface, to achieve the development of the national salvation movement, but even unwilling to have mass movements, and are jealous of others doing mass movements. Why do we do civil affairs work? For the sake of the anti-Japanese war, in order to defeat the Japanese, eliminate the Japanese, and win the victory of the anti-Japanese war. From the perspective of the army itself, for the survival of the army, without the masses, the army cannot develop, cannot grow, and will be defeated. Especially under the comparative conditions of the Sino-Japanese War, our weapons are much worse than the Japanese. Taking our New Fourth Army as an example, it is even worse than the weapons of ordinary anti-Japanese armies. We use such inferior weapons to fight against the superior Japanese, mainly relying on the strength and help of the masses. If there are no masses, then not only will we not be able to resist the Japanese, but we will not be able to achieve victory in combat under circumstances where the strengths and weaknesses are so disparate. This shows why we do mass work, why we see this work as so important to our survival and victory, because it is inseparable. Our mass movement for more than half a year can be divided into three parts to discuss:</p>
<p>1. Experiences and lessons of the past six months: A. The first experience, which can also be said to be a lesson, is that the actual actions of the army itself are the basic conditions for obtaining the faith and support of the masses. It is the foundation for starting civil affairs work. I remember when our army set out from Nanchang, I once gave a report to the service group comrades on civil affairs work in the war zone. I pointed out that the first thing to do is to use the actions of the army itself as the basis for civil affairs work, because we are an army doing civil affairs work, and the first thing is to have strict discipline ourselves in order to gain the trust of the masses. We think that this year, especially in the second half of the year, can further prove this point. For example, in the first half of the year, after our army concentrated, when advancing to the war zone, we did not do propaganda work, and the work only began after the service comrades arrived after the war environment unfolded, but why did many masses everywhere welcome and believe in us, and many masses help us, so that our army gained extremely good faith among the masses in southern Anhui, because our army had extremely good discipline, not only good discipline, but also protected the masses everywhere, and respected the interests of the masses everywhere. Therefore, although we did not have much publicity, we were welcomed everywhere. When our army advanced to the Jiangnan combat area, because of the propaganda of the Japanese army and the propaganda during the past domestic wars, many people did not understand us, but our advance team went and came back, and the Jiangnan masses immediately recognized us. When the main force advanced, the masses welcomed us everywhere. These facts prove this truth: army discipline is the foundation of civil affairs work. Similarly, it proves the opposite: which army has bad discipline, even if it does a lot of publicity, the common people still don't believe it. Many people think that we don't know how much money we spend on publicity work, but we feel very ashamed of the real publicity work. It is because of the actions of our army that we can gain the trust of the masses, and it is much easier to do civil affairs work in this way. B. Second, the victory of combat is a necessary condition for developing civil affairs work. Simply relying on propaganda without fighting, or fighting poorly, the common people say, "Good is good, but it's useless!" In a simple sentence, the reason why we have gained the support of the broad masses in Jiangnan and quickly developed civil affairs work is largely related to our victory in Jiangnan. This is the second experience and lesson. C. Third, the united front is the prerequisite for carrying out civil lotus work. In my last report, I specifically pointed out that everything must go through the united front, and only on the basis of the united front can the masses be mobilized. Today we can also prove that whichever united front is used well, the work can be greatly developed, and where it is a little worse, the work will be a little worse. D. Going deep into the masses is an effective method for mobilizing and organizing the masses. To organize and mobilize, relying solely on propaganda is not enough, and slogans are not enough. These effects are very limited. You must go into the masses to understand the masses, to get close to the masses, and only on this basis can you organize and mobilize them. It is empty to want to do mass work while always standing above the masses. This can be seen from our experience. In the front and rear, where we have not gone deep into the masses, the work is still not enough, and the mobilization of the masses cannot be achieved. This is the fourth experience and lesson. E. Fifth, pay attention to the lives of the masses. This is the main condition for mobilizing the masses to resist Japan, and it can also be said to be a necessary factor. To enable the broad masses to participate in the anti-Japanese war, we must pay attention to their livelihood problems. If we don't find a way to solve their livelihood problems, then we cannot raise their enthusiasm, because this is what they feel personally. Looking at our experience, the place that pays attention to this issue and gives a considerable solution, the anti-Japanese sentiment in that place is different, and the mass movement in the place that does not take this issue into account is much worse, not only in the front, but also in the rear. But we have a principle, under the highest principle of the anti-Japanese war, to solve the livelihood problems, to mobilize the masses for the anti-Japanese war to achieve their participation in the anti-Japanese war, and to solve the suffering of the people from the perspective of the anti-Japanese war. This is a principle, and it is also the fifth experience and lesson of our civil affairs work for more than half a year. F. No matter what mass movement, from the beginning of initiation, continued development, and deepening, the consolidation of mass organizations, if we cannot promote many cadres from the local masses and cultivate cadres to lead the work, this mass movement cannot be developed, and mass organizations will not be consolidated. Only by promoting and cultivating cadres from the local masses can these cadres consolidate and strengthen mass organizations. Without these backbones, it will not work. If that place has considerable cadres, and its own cadres are working, the mass movement will definitely be good. It is obviously ineffective to always ask others to handle it for him. G. Seventh is an experience and lesson in our method. Regarding dramas and costumed speeches, this is the most effective method of rural propaganda. If we have very good dramas suitable for rural areas to improve their sense of combat, it will be more effective than giving very long reports. The general public has not gone to school, so we must pay attention to our level of understanding and adopt various methods. If we give a report like today, the farmers will get dizzy. We say that the methods that have been effective in the countryside since the struggle can be said that speeches and slogans are not very effective, and even artistic pictures are not very effective. If it is a costumed speech or a play, it is different. H. Eighth, civil affairs work and the mobilization of the masses, let us analyze it a little bit. Where there is civil affairs work, the mobilization of the masses is easy; where can it meet the needs of the anti-Japanese war and reduce the difficulty of mobilization? Wherever there are mass organizations, the mobilization will be faster. Masses without organizations have insufficient political understanding, and the mobilization power is small. In short, it is a big weakness in the anti-Japanese war. Why can't the masses be mobilized? It is because there is no organization, so we must do civil affairs work, organize the masses, and rely on mass organizations to meet the requirements of the anti-Japanese war. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Intense Street Fighting in Zengcheng, the Masses Rose Up, the Japanese and Puppet Troops Suffered Setbacks in Foshan and Junta</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan, 15th] Frontline phone call: The Chinese army besieging Zengcheng selected daring troops to rush into Zengcheng at dawn on the 14th. Gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls in the city, and loud explosions were heard everywhere. When our follow-up troops advanced to Chali at the hour of Chen, the Japanese and puppet artillery from Shangluogang fired at Zengcheng, covering a unit of about several hundred Japanese infantry to come to aid, intending to divide their forces to meet the attack.

Also, Captain Yagi of the Japanese squadron in the Battle of Makou was indeed killed by us.</p>
<p>[Dongjiang Express News] Our army's counterattack on Zengcheng, under the planning and command of Wu Tingwei, Chief of the General Department of the 9th Army Corps, and Zhaoce, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Army Corps, broke through the city walls on the 14th and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese and puppet troops. The entire city has fallen into the hands of our army. It will not be difficult to wipe out the Japanese and puppet troops stubbornly defending the city in one fell swoop. The details of our army's counterattack on Zengcheng are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Counterattack Process</p>
<p>According to frontline military news, our army's siege of Zengcheng was divided into three routes. The leading troops were the regiments of Chen Ji, Ni Dingheng, and Wei De, who went straight to Zengcheng along the Bo-Zeng Highway. The troops of Lin Weichou and the Huang Brigade and the Wen Shuhai Brigade met at Gaotan and fiercely attacked the front of Zengcheng. The regiments of Liu Kexiong and Chen Shuying and the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade and the Shi Jishi Division went east along the Conghua-Zengcheng Line, attached to the sides and rear of Zengcheng. The three armies completed the encirclement line after the 13th, and the attack on the city began at 6 pm. The Japanese and puppet troops tried to stop our army from advancing, so they set up more than a dozen steel cannons and more than twenty machine guns at the East Gate Bridge and the Zeng-Cong Station outside the city and stubbornly defended the pre-built defensive fortifications, launching a dense bombardment of our advancing army.</p>
<p>Street Fighting Situation</p>
<p>At that time, our various armies believed that the Japanese and puppet troops stubbornly defending the city were trapped beasts, so to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they only controlled the high ground outside the northeast gate and took control steps, calmly responding. After a stalemate until about 5 am, the Japanese and puppet forces were exhausted. Seeing that the time had come, our army gave an order and broke through the city walls with the force of a bamboo. The leading plainclothes team first entered the city and engaged in fierce street battles with the remaining Japanese and puppet troops. At dawn, at about 7 am, several Japanese planes suddenly flew from Guangzhou to our army's position in a rotating bombardment, but our officers and soldiers fought to the death, one after another, and continued to rush into the city, in the midst of soaring flames, each occupying broken tiles and hiding walls, short-range fighting, hand-to-hand combat, the battle situation was extremely tragic, and after several hours of melee, the Japanese and puppet troops gradually showed their support, and set fire to the main roads and command posts to stop our advance. For a time, the flames were raging, and dense smoke filled the air, covering the entire city, which could be seen for several miles.</p>
<p>Can Be Taken Soon</p>
<p>After the Japanese and puppet troops defending the city set the fire, most of them fled in a mess, leaving a small part to cover, desperately stopping our pursuit. The remnant Japanese and puppet troops, together with the puppet maintenance association and puppet police, stubbornly resisted. The rest mostly retreated to the Zeng (Cheng) Guang (Zhou) highway station to prevent our army from outflanking them and cutting off their retreat. According to the latest news, the Liang Shiji unit of our army at the North Gate has already copied out the Guang-Zeng line to cut off the retreat of the Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese and puppet troops are surrounded on both sides and are already shaking. Zengcheng will be officially recovered by evening. As of 12 o'clock, no less than three or four hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers were wounded, their corpses lay everywhere, and blood stained the thoroughfares. More than a hundred residents in the city who failed to escape were detained and massacred by the Japanese and puppet troops. It is difficult to calculate the military supplies and firearms seized at one time.</p>

<h3>King of Ordos Reprimands Prince De</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yulin, 15th] During the second temporary meeting of the Mongolian-Tibetan Council, the reporter accompanied Mr. Chen Yujia to Yu. Wang, the Acting Chairman of the Sakke Banner Mongolian Council, deeply criticized Prince De for attempting to steal the mausoleum of Genghis Khan in his closing remarks, saying, "The traitor De recognizes the thief as his father and is trapped in the mud, unable to extricate himself. He is not only sorry for the party and the country, but also for our ancestors who were outstanding in martial arts. Now he even wants to steal the mausoleum, he is insane. Now we have strict precautions in Yijin Holo, and have sent troops to guard it."</p>
<h3>Progress of Resistance in Guangdong Province: Yu Hanmou Issues Proclamation to the People, "Even If One Breath Remains, the Determination to Overthrow Qin Will Not Waver; With the People's Help, We Will Surely Recover the Strong Spear of Qi"</h3>
<p>Recently, our troops on various fronts launched counter-offensives, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. General Yu Hanmou, after the commencement of our army's counter-offensive on the Guangdong battlefield, specially issued a proclamation to the people of Guangdong, saying, "It has been several months since Hanmou communicated with my elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen. I, conscious of my role as one awaiting punishment, am utterly inadequate. Like Bao Xu weeping blood, I merely harbor the heart to restore Chu; like Yue Shi resting on his spear, I have not yet fulfilled my ambition to swallow the barbarians. I have allowed my countrymen to hold empty hopes for banners, and allowed the Cloud Mountain of Pearl River to be occupied by barbarians for so long, causing me great shame towards my homeland and country. In reason and in emotion, I find it hard to forgive myself. However, Hanmou deeply believes that the fighting spirit of our army has never wavered, and the morale of the people of Guangdong is greatly encouraging. At the same time, I especially believe that the foundation of a long-term resistance war lies with the people, and the future chances of victory ultimately depend on the assistance of the entire population. Therefore, for the past six months, I have endured pain and humiliation, on the one hand, strictly ordering my subordinates to actively train, so that officers and soldiers are united and work hard for success. On the other hand, I have paid special attention to the pacification of local areas and the connection with the people, striving to make military and political affairs converge and progress together, fostering the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and establishing the foundation of cooperation between soldiers and civilians. Fortunately, the comrades of our army and fellow countrymen in various places have been able to share hardships and difficulties, and treat each other with sincerity and without suspicion. Recently, our troops launched attacks, and progress has been made on the eastern, western, and northern fronts. The main reason for our victories is that we have been able to obtain the assistance of local militias and the people. The battle of Hua County is a particularly prominent example. According to the investigation of Hua County, the unit numbers of the troops (officially issued by the Japanese Imperial Army) were the Bobian and Tingjing units. When our army successfully attacked and entered the county seat, the people returned from the mountains en masse, cheering along the streets and helping us carry the spoils of war. The enthusiasm was extremely high. Although this is a small victory and a small advance, it is not of great significance to the gains and losses of the overall war situation. However, this proves that our people sympathize with the War of Resistance and have become more determined over time, and it further proves that the will of our people is where victory lies. Its significance in manifesting the spirit of our nation and strengthening the belief of our people is extremely important. This is why Hanmou does not dare to be trifling and dares to report this to comfort my elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen. Alas, we admire the people of Yan who refuse to submit to the strong, so Li Yu returned with his spear. Startled by the shouts of the masses, the Khitans retreated. From ancient times, the morale of the people has been enough to suppress the enemy's atmosphere. Moreover, the mountains and rivers of Guangdong have nurtured a spirit of righteousness and bravery. The battle blood of the Pomegranate Flower Pagoda is still fresh, and the spirit of the Three Yuanli is not far away. The years are getting colder and the seasons are apparent, how can the ancient times be different from now? Therefore, the power of the people that will be brought into play in the future will provide greater and more inspiring assistance to our army. This can also be pre-announced to comfort my elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen. As long as Hanmou has one breath left, I am determined to make an early decision. The shame of residing in Ju has not been washed away, and the determination to overthrow Qin will not waver. Some of you are displaced abroad, and your grief is even deeper. Some of you are trapped in the occupied areas, and your cries are not heard. All these feelings are my fault. I vow to exhaust the remaining years of my life to save my homeland and repay my country. In these difficult times, I will do my utmost to serve. I respectfully present these meager words, hoping for your enlightened consideration. (Central News Agency)"</p>
<h3>Southwest Headquarters Values Improving People's Livelihood; Formulates Measures to Lift People Out of Poverty and Blockade Enemy Areas; Orders Subordinates to Implement Them Conscientiously</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qujiang] The political department of the Southwest Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission reported that the enemy used political tactics to win over the hearts of the people. Recently, transportation in various places has been inconvenient, and the distribution of materials has been uneven, resulting in a shortage of daily necessities. Even if there are any, the supply cannot meet the demand, and the prices are high. Villagers are forced by life to take risks, which is a great obstacle to the future of the war of resistance. Now that the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun, it is imperative to win over the people. Therefore, to eliminate this kind of bad phenomenon, we must first alleviate the suffering of the people, and then find ways to prevent and control it, so that we can achieve results. Yesterday, special countermeasures were proposed: (1) The military and political authorities in various places should find ways to regulate materials and assess prices, so as to ensure that supply and demand are met, and the burden on the people is reduced. (2) Intensify propaganda work, expose the enemy's conspiracies, and urge the people to conscientiously implement the anti-Japanese public agreement. (3) Strictly implement the anti-blockade policy against enemy areas, and strictly inspect import and export trade goods and mail. If they are enemy goods, they will be detained and handed over to the local anti-Japanese support association for disposal, but no disturbances are allowed under any pretext. (4) Once private enemy merchants are detected, they should be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. These strategies have been separately telegraphed to the various political departments under their jurisdiction for implementation, and they have also been instructed to follow them. The political department of the Fourth War Zone received the telegram and ordered its subordinates to implement it.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Formulates Administrative Program</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] Since Li Hanun, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, took office in January of this year, he has believed that the facilities of the provincial government during the war of resistance should be coordinated with military affairs. He then ordered the various departments to study administrative plans within their respective jurisdictions in order to adapt to the wartime environment. It is reported that the Guangdong Provincial Wartime Administrative Program has now been formulated based on the findings of the various departments. The content of the program is divided into three parts: political, economic, and cultural. Special attention is paid to promoting the morale of the people and implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization. It will be promulgated and implemented after being passed by the next provincial affairs meeting, so as to reform politics, develop the economy, and promote culture.</p>
<h3>Impression of the Guerrilla Army in Southern Shanxi (Part 1)</h3>
<p>(Communication from Northwestern Shanxi) I ran to the front line and heard many stories about the guerrilla army in southern Shanxi from the local people. Of course, these stories were both good and bad. Some said that this part of the army was not polite to the people, while others said that this part of the army often fought against the Japanese, and had won many victories. A comrade from the County Mobilization Committee told me this story:</p>
<p>"On September 18th, Commander Du suddenly asked the cadres... 'What day is today?' Then he gave an order and personally led two teams to attack the Japanese near the Tongpu Railway. After the attack, he gathered the troops and gave a speech, roughly saying... 'We use battle to commemorate September 18th!'"</p>
<p>Hearing the words from all sides, I had such a guess about the guerrilla army in southern Shanxi... "Commander Du may be a hero from the military? Is there a problem with extreme democracy in military discipline?"</p>
<p>On December 4th last year, the weather was so clear. We were still hanging around the battlefield after the Battle of Xinkou and walked to ×× Village. This is the front line, and there is always the possibility of contact with the Japanese, so the sentries on the mountain were heavily guarded. When we entered the village entrance, the sentries interrogated us very strictly.</p>
<p>We were invited by the headquarters to stay in a village one or two miles nearby. Then, two comrades in charge went to see Commander Du to discuss the condolences. As a result, it was agreed that we would clumsily carry out the condolences at 4:00 p.m. We came out to offer condolences this time, and we could never complete the work according to the scheduled time. We were very happy that we could complete the task that day, but when the time came, Commander Du was nowhere to be seen. We ran to the village entrance several times to look around, but there was no sign of him. While we were anxious, Chief of Staff Gao came with Captain Zhou and two political workers.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Gao is a man of eloquence, with a sharp tongue. When he speaks, it is like a cannon of words. Except for one or two comrades in charge who stated our intention, the rest of us listened silently. He first explained the reason why Commander Du could not come today, because he was busy with military affairs and could not spare any time. The condolence event was changed to tomorrow. Then he introduced the origin of the guerrilla army in southern Shanxi and talked about many practical issues.</p>
<p>After listening to Chief Gao's words, I knew that this part of the army grew up in battle, and now it has grown strong. In the constant battles, the Japanese were dealt a great blow, such as the battle of Yanzhuang Weicun, which achieved a great victory, won the support of the people, and inspired the soldiers' anti-Japanese sentiment. Commander Du was not as I imagined, on the contrary, he was a refined "Confucian general," who had studied in the United States for many years. Because he was heartbroken by the fall of half of the country, he abandoned his comfortable life and ran to the front line to fight to the death with the Japanese. In several battles, the Japanese artillery hit near him. Military discipline is also particularly strict, and soldiers who violate the interests of the people or desert are shot. Chief Gao especially pointed out that the previous misunderstandings with various parties were because there was no political training office. When he praised this point, he glanced at the two political workers who accompanied him and said happily:</p>
<p>"Now it's good! Our political training office has been established, and from now on we can integrate with the people!"</p>
<p>The next day, as soon as the sun came out, Commander Du came. He was of medium height, wearing a coarse gray military uniform, with a very gentle attitude, without any bureaucratic habits. He was calm and taciturn and introduced himself to us. Then he led us to comfort the army.</p>
<p>The team was gathered in a square outside the village. What caught our eyes was the strict formation, complete weapons, and high morale. They sang majestic songs to welcome us.</p>
<p>After we explained our intention and offered warm condolences to them, we then respectfully presented Commander Du with a blue sky and white sun flag with the four characters "National Hero" written on it. Commander Du held the national flag in his hand, fluttering in the breeze. The soldiers who defended the motherland saluted, and then Commander Du gave a speech. He said: "This is the national flag of the Republic of China, and everyone should respect it! Everyone should respond to the kindness of the condolence delegation and plant the national flag of the Republic of China all over China! Recover the lost land and drive the Japanese out!" After the speech, he calmly said to the soldiers: "Are we afraid of the Japanese, or are the Japanese afraid of us?"</p>
<p>"The Japanese are afraid of us!" It was a firm and loud answer.</p>
<p>Finally, Commander Du led the soldiers to sing, led the soldiers to shout slogans: "Fight to the last soldier!" "Fight to the last gun!" The resolute roar echoed in the mountains.</p>
<p>After the condolences, Commander Du accompanied us to our residence and talked with us earnestly. We ate breakfast while listening to him talk, and he patiently told us about the battle and introduced his background. He said that he was very willing to be with the students. Before parting, he revealed his reluctance.</p>
<p>After this condolence visit, the guerrilla army in southern Shanxi left a deep impression on my mind. In Commander Du's environment, it is very possible to live in Kamchatka and live a life of Western-style buildings and cars. However, he, he loves the life of battle! He wants the freedom of his motherland! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Our Army's Recent Victory Extensively Praised by British Newspapers Yesterday; Famous French Journalist Li Meng Arrives in Shashi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] Today, the Daily Telegraph published an article extensively praising China's recent successful military operations. It stated that China has been able to launch a counter-offensive in the spring of the third year of the war, which proves the futility of the aggressors' attempts to conquer China and the endlessness of their losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shashi, 14th] The famous French journalist Li Meng and his wife arrived in Shashi from Xiangfan on the morning of the 24th. People from all walks of life held a grand welcome meeting. Mr. and Mrs. Li reported in detail on the good impressions they had gained from their travels to various places and their understanding of China. At the same time, they also expressed that they would do their best to publicize the enemy's atrocities in China and the heroic spirit of our army and people in resisting the war to the international community. Mr. and Mrs. Li are scheduled to take a boat to Changsha on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Regulates Military and Civilian Food Supply</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Quick News] Zhang Fakui, commander-in-chief of the Fourth War Zone, believes that the food supply for our troops on the front line is extremely important at a time when the military counter-offensive in Guangdong Province is making steady progress. In addition to finding ways to provide large-scale assistance, in order to seek mutual assistance and regulation of food supplies on various fronts, he specially ordered the food management office in the area to investigate the actual food situation of the military and civilians in various places on the front line. It is reported that Shen Pengfei, the director of the office, has been ordered to send personnel to the eastern, western, and northern routes of Guangdong Province to conduct thorough investigations. It is also planned to establish food supply stations in convenient locations on various routes to provide food for the troops and to contact the local government to provide food for the fleeing people. This work is being actively planned and will be realized soon.</p>
<h3>Increase Production and Expand Spring Plowing</h3>
<p>[Qujiang Quick News] Li Hanun, chairman of the provincial government, pays close attention to developing wartime production and increasing food for the people. It has been decided to provide rural loans to help farmers cultivate wasteland. At present, the urgent task is to expand spring plowing. Methods for promotion have now been formulated, and the main points are to strictly order the county, district, and township offices to effectively supervise farmers to cultivate as much of the original cultivated land as possible, and to force them to cultivate wasteland. Otherwise, the district office will hire workers to cultivate the land on behalf of the farmers. Production cooperatives for refugees in the war zone will be organized, and the provincial bank or relief agency will provide loans to undertake wasteland cultivation. Detailed joint methods have been handed over to the construction department for processing and will be implemented in the short and medium term.</p>
<h3>Miss Killed the Enemy and Died for Her Country; Supreme Glory of the Chinese Nation; Government Will Commend Yan Huilan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, 14th] Miss Yan Huilan, the leader of the local self-defense squadron in Xinkaitang, Yueyang, led 70 brave men of her unit to attack the Japanese near Xinkaitang on the evening of the 19th of last month. When breaking through the barbed wire, they were discovered by the Japanese and machine-gunned. Yan and two squad leaders unfortunately died for their country. It is reported that Miss Yan was only eighteen years old and killed the enemy and died for her country. It is heard that the government intends to commend her to encourage others.</p>
<h3>Desolate! Anti-Communist Meeting Fails; No One Willing to Participate; Big Disappointment for Japanese in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 15th] The "Anti-Communist Festival Celebration" prepared by the Japanese side was originally scheduled to be held at the Richard Hotel tonight, but it has been cancelled. Japanese newspapers said that the meeting was originally planned to hold a dance party, but it has been cancelled due to insufficient space. However, according to other sources, it was due to the small number of people attending.</p>
<h3>International Radio Station; Kunming Branch Station Has Excellent Business</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 15th] Since the Kunming International Radio Branch Station started broadcasting, its business has been excellent, especially the commercial telegrams between Kunming and Hong Kong. In order to improve its business, the station is now reducing the price of telegrams sent to Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma.</p>
<h3>The New Provincial Capital of Guangdong: The New Posture of Qujiang</h3>
<p>— Tang Shi</p>
<p>[Special Article from This Newspaper] With the shift in military needs, the capital of Guangdong Province has moved from Guangzhou to Lian County, and then from Lian County to Qujiang. At present, Qujiang has become the political center of Guangdong Province. Recently, most of the national salvation groups have also gathered here. In the past, this was only an important transportation point on the Yuehan Road, and the national salvation movement was relatively deserted. However, now it has shown a vigorous and active scene.</p>
<p>Although the enemy cruelly bombed most of the prosperous area here—the shops and houses along Fengdu South Road from Zhifenglie Road to Qujiang Bridge into a field of rubble, the other areas that have not been poisoned are still operating as usual. Groups and teams of young men's heroic teams pass through the streets from time to time. The neat steps and loud songs show that the newly born force in the second stage is in the midst of rapid development. The extra-large wall newspapers on the streets, with popular text, vivid satirical pictures, clear maps, and concise and powerful slogans, have completely changed the dry and empty style of the past and appeared in a brand-new posture. In addition to armed comrades, young men and women comrades in blue twill uniforms who are engaged in the national salvation movement also pass by in a hurry.</p>
<p>I have only been here for two days, but I have met no less than hundreds of comrades who used to work together. After they withdrew from Guangzhou, they scattered to various places along the East River and South River. Some served in the army on the front line, some joined the guerrillas in the occupied areas, and some were engaged in civilian transportation in the rear. However, recently, many groups have gathered here unexpectedly—of course, this does not mean that they have put down their work and come, but that each group has a part of its members who have come here. Some are being trained, some are passing through this place for a temporary stay, and there are also some groups organized by government agencies who have been assigned to work here on a regular basis. The following is a summary of the information gathered from various sources:</p>
<p>The groups currently in Qujiang include the Anti-Japanese Vanguard General Team, the Anti-Japanese Youth Vanguard Group, the Youth Group, the Women's Working Committee of the New Life Movement, the Political Work Brigade of the Fourth War Zone, the Fifth Political Work Brigade of the Military Affairs Commission, the First Brigade of the Provincial Relief Committee, the Security Political Brigade, the Social Service Office organized by the Provincial Party Department, and the Qujiang County People's Education Center.</p>
<p>1. Anti-Japanese Vanguard General Team</p>
<p>"Anti-Japanese Vanguard" is the abbreviation of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team. Before the fall of Guangzhou, it was a unified youth organization. At that time, there were about 2,000 people. On January 21st last year, they set off on foot from Guangzhou. At that time, most of the members of the political work team organized by the Guangdong Provincial Mobilization Committee were from the Anti-Japanese Vanguard. Later, they gradually developed while working in various places, and 17 branch offices (i.e., county team headquarters) have been established in various counties. It is estimated that there are a total of 23 county team headquarters in the budget. The general team headquarters was originally located in Xinxing, and only moved to Qujiang in early February.</p>
<p>From March 21st to 24th, the Anti-Japanese Vanguard General Team Headquarters held its third plenary committee meeting. Local party and government leaders attended the meeting to provide guidance. In addition to reviewing past work, it also decided on the following guidelines for the youth movement:</p>
<p>(1) Believe in the Three Principles of the People, practice the program of resisting the war and building the country, sincerely support the government, support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, support the united front, and participate in all anti-Japanese work.</p>
<p>(2) Urgently mobilize the vast number of young people to join the team, to various armed teams, directly participate in the war, and urgently mobilize the people to launch guerrilla warfare in the battlefield and in the occupied areas, and to attack and eliminate the Japanese.</p>
<p>(3) Call on young people to actively participate in various military and political training classes organized by the government to cultivate military and political cadres.</p>
<p>(4) Based on the principles of consolidating unity, opposing division, helping each other, developing each other, and people's livelihood, enrich the existing youth organizations in various places, and then establish a unified front for the youth of the province.</p>
<p>Recently, various committee members have returned to various places to promote their work. The daily work of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard includes the following aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Armed Team—About 300 people work in the 12th Army, and another part of them are fighting guerrillas in the Zengcheng area.</p>
<p>(2) Civilian Group—Establishing civilian anti-Japanese associations, civilian training classes, etc. in various villages.</p>
<p>(3) Uniting Youth—There is already a preliminary foundation for a unified organization in the province, with a recent population of more than 6,000.</p>
<p>(4) Self-education—Every week, team members have group meetings, seminars, marching exercises, etc.</p>
<p>2. Anti-Japanese Youth Vanguard Group</p>
<p>Also withdrew from Guangzhou on "October 21st" last year. However, because the withdrawal time was more urgent, it felt very embarrassed, resulting in considerable losses. The total number of people in the group is relatively small, about 200. Their work is divided into three aspects: one is to participate in the work mainly held by the government, one is to develop civilian organizations, and one is to gather the original members and absorb new members to engage in supplementation and adjustment. The general team headquarters is also currently located in Qujiang.</p>

<h3>Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Consider Air Force Cooperation; British-Soviet Diplomatic Talks Underway; Joint Assistance to Guaranteed Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Mail" here declared in a discussion of British-Soviet diplomatic talks today that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are now considering air force cooperation in order to take joint action when the countries they guarantee are attacked. The correspondent pointed out that the biggest difficulty at the moment is that Poland and Romania are hesitant about the Soviet Union's wartime assistance, but all parties believe that the two countries will welcome the Soviet Union's air force assistance. At the same time, the two countries also hope that the Soviet Union will guarantee the supply of raw materials, financial resources, and manufactured goods. Therefore, all parties suggested that the three powers should take air force cooperation in addition to military cooperation. The correspondent also said that the British government is now paying close attention to the increasing threat to British interests in Egypt and Gibraltar. The Ministry of War has been holding continuous meetings to study the military defense plan for the two places if recent military activities are necessary.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 15th] The work of setting up military obstacles here is still in progress. The two entrances to the British naval commander's port have been blocked.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The British ambassador to the Soviet Union visited Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today on the instructions of the government to further discuss British-Soviet talks. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the British side did not disclose the nature of this meeting, but it is generally believed that since Britain has given guarantees to Poland and Romania, the Soviet Union's border has also been guaranteed. The current plan is to seek how the Soviet Union can provide support when either of the two countries is attacked. At the same time, Britain is continuing to discuss the Balkan issue with Turkey.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 14th] The British Foreign Office today issued a special instruction to the British ambassador to the Soviet Union. The content is unknown, but it is heard that the British ambassador will hold a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in the near future. This may be a sign that Britain and the Soviet Union will establish a limited military agreement. It is said that unless the Italian troops stationed in Western Italy withdraw in early May, Britain will be forced to announce the abandonment of the British-Italian friendship agreement. According to unconfirmed reports, the British ambassador is about to negotiate with the Soviet government to conclude an air force agreement. Due to the difficulty of land cooperation, this matter is logically correct. Diplomatic circles believe that Hitler is now conducting diplomatic opposition to Lithuania, which is actually Hitler's first response to the "anti-Hitler" group.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 14th] The news that the British Foreign Office issued a special instruction to the British ambassador to the Soviet Union has been officially confirmed. The meeting between the British ambassador and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov has been changed to Saturday. Although the future of the British-Soviet aviation agreement is uncertain, it is believed that the British side is preparing to conduct serious negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Since Britain and France provided guarantees to Romania and Greece, the diplomatic activities of the democratic countries have continued unabated. They are now working hard to strengthen the second link in the anti-aggression chain, that is, the relationship between Poland and Romania. According to reports, Poland and Romania have already signed an alliance. At the same time, negotiations with the Soviet Union are still ongoing. All parties hope to agree on satisfactory measures with Moscow, and the Soviet Union will indirectly provide material assistance to Poland and Romania. Because France originally signed a consultation agreement with the Soviet Union, this negotiation with the Soviet Union is actually led by France (rather than Britain). Yugoslavia's attitude is still doubtful, but it is heard that Bulgaria has expressed dissatisfaction with the Albanian incident and does not dare to cooperate with the Axis countries, believing that the spearhead of destroying the Balkans. If Bulgaria can maintain good relations with the Balkan countries, a line of resistance to aggression can still be established there.</p>
<h3>Repercussions of the Anglo-French Declaration</h3>
<p>[London, 14th Dispatch] The major resolutions of all parties in the House of Commons regarding the Prime Minister's declaration yesterday are uniformly supported, as can be seen in today's newspaper commentaries. The Times, citing the guarantees given to Poland, Greece, and Romania, stated that these three countries, traditionally seen as standing at the forefront of aggressive violence, can now have their worries alleviated somewhat. This is because if they are forced to fight for freedom, it will not be just these three countries that are fighting. British policy has taken a major step forward. This action by Britain is not a careless measure, and its commitment to this responsibility was carefully considered beforehand, understanding the meaning of this responsibility. This move by Britain can represent a correct national self-determination arising from the evolution of the current situation, and it is flawless, they say.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] All Soviet newspapers have published Chamberlain's speech in detail, but without any commentary. A Soviet spokesperson, while refusing to criticize, indicated that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the effectiveness of Britain's new policy of stopping aggression is not as cold and mocking as it was during the Munich Agreement last September, they say.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 15th Dispatch] The Prime Minister's declaration in the House of Commons, guaranteeing Greek independence, has made a very positive impression here. The public is very welcoming of Britain's new policy, believing it is sufficient to resist the demons of brutal destruction. All newspapers have published the speech in a prominent position, but without commentary.</p>
<p>[Capital of Yugoslavia, 15th Dispatch] Although there is no criticism here regarding the declaration by the heads of the British and French governments guaranteeing Romania and Greece, the public welcomes it warmly, they say.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th Dispatch] Following Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons and the announcement of unilateral guarantees to Greece, Berlin political circles believe that Britain's continued promotion of its encirclement policy against Germany is an undeniable fact. However, the question remains whether Greece and Romania are willing to accept British protection. It is recalled that Germany and Romania previously concluded a commercial agreement, deepening relations between the two countries. Mussolini has also expressed friendship towards Greece. Therefore, Berlin believes that Britain's guarantee is not intended to maintain peace, but rather to preemptively seize military strongholds for combat. Britain is currently seeking naval bases in the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea. The British Prime Minister's declaration stated that if necessary, an agreement could be concluded with Greece immediately. This situation is very similar to the position of the Allied forces and Greece before the European War. It is recalled that in 1915, British and French troops disregarded Greece's neutrality and landed in Salonica, continuing to occupy Athens and other places. Under these circumstances, Greece was then forced to join the Allied forces. This time, Greece's acceptance of the British guarantee is intended to avoid a second British invasion. The Romanian Foreign Minister will go to Berlin on April 18, and Greek cabinet members are also preparing to attend the celebration of Hitler's birthday. These two events are enough to prove that these two countries do not feel threatened by Germany. In short, the German side has a very low assessment of Britain's stance, but believes that reintroducing Soviet Russia into the European vortex is the greatest crisis. Daladier's concise speech shows that France is deeply dependent on Britain, they say.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 14th Dispatch] Gayda commented in today's "Italian Daily" harshly criticizing Chamberlain's remarks on the Albanian event and declaring that Britain has no interests in the Adriatic Sea. Gayda, referring to Daladier's declaration, said it was not worth commenting on, because France has been insignificant in the European political arena since deceiving Italy in 1935.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 4th Dispatch] The Anglo-French guarantee is currently being considered here from the perspective of Hungarian reformers. The general view is that the declarations of the two major Western democracies do not constitute an absolute guarantee of the sovereignty of the two Balkan countries under any strong demands. Therefore, a peaceful revision of the treaty is not absolutely impossible. A certain newspaper strongly stated that Chamberlain and Daladier's official statements do not guarantee Romania's existing borders, and that there are still unresolved issues between Hungary and Romania that must be resolved before the establishment of good neighborly relations, they say.</p>
<h3>German Military Movements Busy in the German-Austrian Region; Spanish Troops Move Closer to the French Border; France Has Increased Border Defense Strength; Germany and Italy Plot to Partition Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 14th Dispatch] After France learned that 5,000 Spanish troops had moved into Villa, a village only three miles from the French border, it quickly dispatched a large army to the Pyrenees border to strengthen defenses. At the same time, the French also dispatched troops to garrison near Gibraltar, where Spanish troops were concentrated in Rani Li, and heavy artillery such as Zuke vehicles had appeared. British engineers in Gibraltar have cut off the passage between Gibraltar and Rani Li. According to reports from visitors to the French border, German troops are active in the Rhine region and near Trier and Strasbourg. Foreign experts believe that German troops are moving east along the Yugoslav border towards Poland.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Capital of Yugoslavia, 14th Dispatch] Senior officials here have recently confirmed the Associated Press report on Thursday, stating that Italy has offered a guarantee to the border between Yugoslavia and Germany. Informed sources believe that if Yugoslavia refuses this guarantee, Italy will collude with Germany to partition Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Jerusalem, 15th Dispatch] Over the past few days, British troops stationed near Haifa along the coast of Palestine have been practicing with new long-range artillery. Also, most of the British troops stationed in Lydda have been deployed to Egypt. According to the "De Xia" newspaper, local newspapers are not allowed to publish information about troop movements.</p>
<h3>Moroccans Oppose Germany and Italy, Organize Marches and Demonstrations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Gallong Bulanga, 14th Dispatch] Today, a large group of Moroccans marched and demonstrated against Germany and Italy here. The crowd first went to the Muslim temple to pray, and then marched around, shouting slogans against totalitarian countries and calling Italy "Public Enemy Number One of Muslims." When they were about to march towards the Italian consulate, the police stopped them and dispersed them. They later sent representatives to meet with the authorities to protest Italy's policies towards Muslims, "especially the annexation of Albania," expressing dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th Dispatch] The Albanian ambassador here recently sent a reply to the Albanian Foreign Minister, declaring, "I do not recognize the government established with foreign support," asking the Albanian Foreign Minister to value the government.</p>
<p>Italy to Send Governor-General to Albania</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th Dispatch] According to news here last night, the Italian Governor-General to Albania will be filled by a member of the royal family. It is generally believed that the Duke of Bergamo will be elected. Duke Yao is currently the commander-in-chief of the Milan military region and showed his skills during the Abyssinian War. It is said that because the Duke has rich military experience, he is considered the most suitable person during this military operation.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Germany and Italy Preparing to Attack Southeastern Europe; German Army and Navy Conduct Spring Maneuvers; Berlin Announces Start Next Month; Greece Pays Close Attention to Soviet Ship Movements</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 14th Dispatch] The optimism caused by the announcement of British and French guarantees to Greece has recently been hit, as the German fleet's exercise in the western Mediterranean has been officially announced. Also, three Soviet destroyers have sailed from the Black Sea to Helespont. It is generally believed that the Soviet ships may be heading to the Far East, but so far, they have not been seen entering the Suez Canal. If the western Mediterranean is cut off, the British and French guarantees to Greece will be weakened. It is reported that a large amount of Italian military supplies are currently being poured into Albania, and it is also rumored that the Axis countries are preparing to attack Macedonia (southeastern Europe).</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th Dispatch] The German army authorities have ordered the mobilization of soldiers of all ranks in the Berlin area in preparation for spring maneuvers, which have been officially announced to begin next month. About 40 German warships will participate in this spring maneuver, and will start departing for Spanish waters next Tuesday. At the same time, Hitler is studying a response to the British and French encirclement movement. The German side said that this spring maneuver is being held as usual and has nothing to do with the current situation in the Mediterranean, but it is intended to show the cooperation of the Axis countries at sea.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th Dispatch] Informed sources here believe that the joint German-Italian fleet in the Mediterranean is sufficient to compete with the British and French fleets currently in the Mediterranean.</p>
<h3>Germany Fabricates Report, Says Poles Mistreat Germans</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 15th Dispatch] The official news agency here, after remaining silent for several days, today published a large number of reports, stating that anti-German demonstrations are taking place everywhere in Poland, and Germans are being mistreated.

<h3>Goering Arrives in Italy, Meets Mussolini Yesterday, Returns to Berlin Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>—Goering—</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th Dispatch] German Aviation Minister General Goering, who recently visited the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, returned here at noon today for a formal visit. Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and the Chief of the Army General Staff all personally welcomed him.

The streets through which General Goering passed were crowded with people who warmly cheered.</p>
<h3>Siam and Vietnam</h3>
<p>In the future world war, Siam is probably the only Far Eastern nation easily tempted by fascist aggressor countries!</p>
<p>For the sake of mutual restraint between Britain and France, Siam's fate is better than its neighbors Burma and Annam. From the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries onwards, it has always been a buffer state and has not suffered the pain of national subjugation, but its territory has been partially cut off nine times.</p>
<p>Siam has a population of 15 million, and our compatriots account for 2.5 million. In addition to fearing the partition by Britain and France, we also worry about the economic power in the country falling into the hands of overseas Chinese. Therefore, Siam's position in Asia today is similar to Hungary's position in Europe. What it demands is to recover the lost territories since the last century and to achieve true independence and autonomy.</p>
<p>This is a legitimate demand of the Siamese nation. Unfortunately, Siam has not used legitimate revolutionary means to achieve its legitimate demands. In order to oppose imperialism, it has instead embraced imperialism. Since the September 18th Incident, Siam has been the only Asian country that openly expresses pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese sentiments. In 1933, when the League of Nations passed a resolution condemning Japan, only Siam abstained. Overseas Chinese in Siam are often subjected to cruel treatment, and freedom of speech and assembly for anti-Japanese activities is completely deprived.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Siamese army has employed Japanese advisors and purchased Japanese weapons. It is greatly influenced by Japan politically. Japan wants to lend money to Siam to dig the Kra Canal, so that Far Eastern ships can reach the Indian Ocean directly without passing through Singapore. If this project succeeds, it will undoubtedly seriously damage Britain's military and commercial position in the Far East. Although this plan has been temporarily shelved due to British opposition, it has not been completely abandoned.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, German influence has also penetrated into Siam. The number of weapons supplied by Germany to Siam is quite large. This has further increased the uneasiness of Britain and France. Although Siam has not yet joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, key figures in the Siamese government have repeatedly expressed sympathy for the governments of the Anti-Comintern Group.

<h3>Franco's Troops Prepare to Announce Demobilization</h3>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations on Air Force Cooperation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the diplomatic correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph reported, "The authorities of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are currently considering announcing a plan in which the air forces of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will take joint action when any country they guarantee is attacked. The current diplomatic negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are related to this plan."</p>
<p>Whether this news can become a reality is, of course, inconvenient to speculate, but at least it proves that Britain and France currently feel this need, and this news is welcomed by most people in Britain and France. Because to resist aggression and safeguard peace, it is impossible without uniting the Soviet Union. This has long become common knowledge. However, to unite the Soviet Union, it is definitely not enough to just say it. There must be a close cooperation in fact, and the cooperation of the British, French, and Soviet air forces will be an effective guarantee for democratic and peace-loving countries to resist aggression and stop the scourge of war in the future.</p>
<p>We welcome the cooperation of the British, French, and Soviet air forces to become a reality, needless to say. But in order to truly safeguard peace, and not limit it to temporary and partial measures, there is still a need to consider the naval cooperation of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Only in this way can we guarantee the collective security of Northeast Europe, the Near East, and the Far East. If this demand can be realized, we believe that the three major aggressor devils of Germany, Italy, and Japan will have to bow their heads! If we work hard, if the anti-aggression movement of the people of democratic and peace-loving countries progresses, this demand will never be an empty ideal!</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Speech, Severely Condemning Acts of Aggression, Fully Defending Peace in the Americas, Hoping to Rebuild International Discipline</h3>
<p>Roosevelt</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 14th Dispatch) US President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Board of Directors of the Pan American Union today, and broadcast his speech to the world in six languages.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 14th Dispatch) US President Roosevelt, delivered a speech at the Board of Directors of the Pan American Union today, saying, "The Old World is now trapped in a tragic vortex." Old hatreds and new grievances have erupted at the same time, and the reason why the Americas can insist on being independent is because the Americas, when gaining independence and freedom, extravagantly produced a new and strong ideal, that is, to establish an international union. Pan-American countries have openly met and established open agreements, "We hold meetings not as a result of war, but because we hope for peace." The President continued, the Old World's entry into a new stage of disaster is not a matter of fate, "Humans are not prisoners of fate, but only driven by their own ambitions. A few days ago, the leader of a certain great power pointed out that his country was a prisoner of the Mediterranean, and later the head of a certain great power, upon learning that its neighbor had agreed to defend the independence of its first neighbor, actually considered this agreement a threat and encirclement. But in fact, there is absolutely no reason for any peace-loving country to encircle, threaten, or imprison other peace-loving countries." Roosevelt then criticized "the delusion of conquering others," considering it "a ridiculous and criminal act." He also said, "The peace of the Americas that we celebrate today has no weakness. We are prepared to maintain and defend this peace with all our strength. If anyone attempts to undermine this organization and harm any member of our group, we will resolutely retaliate with force. If anyone uses economic oppression as a means, I guarantee that we will also use our country's economic strength as a support, so that no country in the Americas will sacrifice its sovereign freedom in exchange for economic benefits." Roosevelt then said that the countries of the Americas will now also announce their position to the world, "What we are concerned about is not how to defend our coastline alone. The economic structure has gradually made the world a unit. When any place is disturbed by it, it will affect other places. People of the next generation will feel the need to find ways for the Old and New Worlds to coexist and prosper, unless we become a dependency of other countries, then we have the right to state that we have the right to participate in the organization of any international affairs. The concept of the Americas' unwavering commitment to maintaining peace is even more dependent on countries overseas being able to abandon the idea of war. We are also the mainstay of the international situation. Our desire for peace and our belief in mutual defense are equally strong, so that the spirit of temporary victory and the pursuit of invaluable glory are transformed into a spirit of loyalty, sacrifice, and discipline. Only then can we rebuild international discipline. This is the admonition of the New World to the Old World." Roosevelt then said that he believed that the republics of the New World still have enough strength to help the Old World prevent terrible events from happening. Referring to the protest of totalitarian countries being surrounded, Roosevelt said that last year the United States guaranteed Canada that if Canada was attacked from overseas, the United States would unite with it to resist, and later issued a Pan-American declaration in Lima, expressing cooperation to protect its organization from direct or indirect external aggression, "But no country considers that this has made another country a prisoner of other countries, or has been surrounded by other countries. Our measures are not a guarantee of war, but a guarantee of peace, because no country in the Americas intends to invade or monopolize self-esteem. If this move is successful here, can this move not be successful elsewhere? Do we think that only by applying destructive means from hundreds of years ago can we achieve our goals? Will our culture be forever trapped in the tragic vortex of bottomless militarism and constant wars, unable to extricate ourselves? Or will we maintain the ideal of peace and individual culture, and regard this as an essential companion in our lives?"</p>
<p>Debate over American Policy, Two Factions Form</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] After Roosevelt's speech, the debate over American foreign policy has clearly formed opposing positions. Some people are quite skeptical of Roosevelt's intention to interfere in European affairs, because no one can determine what range of military and economic assistance is sufficient to avoid being drawn into the European war. At present, the government's foreign policy, since Roosevelt and Hull's speeches, has clearly determined the path: (1) The United States is willing to provide military and economic assistance to Latin American countries to cope with the aggression of dictators; (2) The United States will lead the countries of the Western Hemisphere to unanimously oppose countries that take war and conquest as their own; (3) If war occurs, the United States will never participate, but will do its best to make the war stop. Those who support the president, such as key members of the Democratic Party and Republican Stimson, unanimously support this view, believing that the United States' interference in European affairs can achieve world peace. Those who oppose Roosevelt's policy are mostly senators, who believe that Roosevelt's speech has only made the atmosphere of the European war more tense, and may cause a certain country to act rashly.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 14th Dispatch] There is unanimous praise here for Roosevelt's speech. All parties hope that Roosevelt's speech can make the military activities of totalitarian countries slightly restrained.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 14th Dispatch] There is great welcome here for Roosevelt's speech, especially the emphasis on Roosevelt's denial of the encirclement policy being carried out by various countries and the expression that the air force can cross oceans in the future, because the latter clearly reflects the military aspect of the United States.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th Dispatch] Officials here condemned Roosevelt's speech, saying that Roosevelt was the precursor to Chamberlain's encirclement policy. The propaganda department said, "How can we hope to obtain other language from the mouth of the father of the encirclement policy, as called by American reporters?"</p>

<p>The European situation is unstable. Whether a world war will break out depends solely on the actions of totalitarian states. Democratic countries around the world, awakened by China's resistance, are determined to maintain peace by armed force. The local authorities here have followed British national policy and made all wartime preparations. In addition to strengthening the army, navy, air force, and air defense capabilities, they have also strictly regulated public order laws to prevent foreigners from causing disturbances in Hong Kong. According to the gazette published yesterday morning, the Governor, in conjunction with the Executive Council, revised the Emergency Ordinance, granting special privileges to police superintendents and medical officers. This ordinance is based on Section 2 of the Emergency Ordinance of 1922, repealing Items (4) and (5) of Section 34 of the Emergency Ordinance published in Hong Kong Government Notice No. 794 on October 12 of last year, and revising the following provisions: Item (4) stipulates that the Commissioner of Police or the Director of Medical Services may detain foreigners in any tent or place as stipulated in Item (2), and may move them to other tents or release them. The aforementioned commissioners or their subordinates may order the police to restrict movement or other behaviors. Item (5) stipulates that the Commissioner of Police, the Director of Medical Services, personnel authorized by them, and military police who have obtained this authorization may use force to arrest and detain any persons deemed to be foreigners subject to this ordinance when necessary, and may transport such persons to tents or places established in accordance with Item (2).</p>
<p>Hong Kong Naval Defense Emergency Order. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Naval Defense Ordinance has been announced and implemented by the Hong Kong government. According to the gazette published yesterday morning, the British Emperor, based on the Colonial Naval Defense Act of 1931 and the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force Ordinance, issued the Hong Kong Naval Defense Order (1931). The order stipulates: (1) Hong Kong may provide for and deploy warships at its own expense; (2) The Admiralty may accept warships provided by the Hong Kong government at its own expense. If the warships are jointly provided by other colonies, the latter's consent is also required; (3) Officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Force (A) must comply with the regulations temporarily implemented to enforce naval discipline, whether serving at sea or on land, within or outside Hong Kong, as well as amended laws suitable for the Hong Kong environment; (B) They may be sent outside Hong Kong to serve and train on any warship or in other agencies or locations; (C) In times of emergency, they shall be incorporated into the naval service, and shall be designated as naval reserves, naval volunteer reserves, or a portion as naval reserves and a portion as naval volunteer reserves; (4) The Admiralty may accept officers and soldiers sent by the Hong Kong government to serve in the navy.</p>
<p>Five Hundred Boy Scouts Trained in Air Defense. In addition, the local air defense authorities are actively training citizens to participate in air defense work. Recently, they also plan to train five hundred boy scouts to provide them with air defense training, so that they can undertake communication work when telephone lines are damaged during wartime, such as reporting bombing situations and population casualties to the nearest air defense monitoring posts for assistance. In addition, the Hong Kong Cyclists' Association has offered its services to the Air Defense Association, dispatching qualified members to undertake communication work during air raids. The Air Defense Association has highly praised this.</p>

<h3>A Rainstorm Suddenly Hit Hong Kong Yesterday, Two Children Drowned When a Boat Capsized at Sea, Dark Clouds Layered, Heavy Rain Flying Horizontally, the Whole of Hong Kong Suddenly Plunged into a Dark World, Many Small Boats in Yau Ma Tei and Cheung Sha Wan Were Blown Over, Resulting in Significant Losses</h3>
<p>At 9:40 yesterday morning, a rainstorm suddenly struck Hong Kong. Dark clouds layered, and heavy rain flew horizontally. In an instant, the whole of Hong Kong was plunged into darkness. Districts in Kowloon such as Kowloon Tong and 花園角 (Flower Garden Corner) were as dark as night. Although the headlights of cars were turned on, they still had to drive slowly. The same scene appeared in North Point and Sai Wan in Hong Kong. Merchants turned on electric lights, and the red light signs and electric lights in the display windows of stores in the Central District were also turned on, creating a scene no different from nighttime. The wind and rain yesterday morning came so suddenly that people were caught off guard. According to the records of the Hong Kong Observatory's anemometer, the wind speed reached 50 miles per hour. Fortunately, it passed quickly, otherwise Hong Kong would have suffered major losses.</p>
<p>Boat Capsizes, People Drown, Two Children Die</p>
<p>It was found that at that time, the sea was in great turmoil, with towering waves. Ship traffic was suspended for tens of minutes. According to investigations after the event, two sampans at sea were unable to escape in time due to the sudden wind and rain and were destroyed by the strong winds. It is believed that many ships outside the port encountered danger or misfortune. More than ten small boats in the Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter suddenly capsized. Many boat people were blown into the sea by the wind. Fortunately, they were rescued by neighboring boats, avoiding drowning. However, Zheng's brother and sister from boat No. 2828 drowned because they were young and weak. It was found that the boat owner, Zheng Shui, lived on the boat with his mother, Guo, his younger sister, Zheng Di, his wife, and two children. That morning, Zheng went ashore for business, leaving only his mother, sister, wife, and children on the boat. Unexpectedly, they were capsized by the strong wind and rain, and everyone sank into the water at the same time. Zheng's eldest daughter, Ah Su (8 years old), and youngest son, Ya Fu (6 years old), floated on the surface of the water, drinking seawater. Later, a ferry sailor from Yau Ma Tei bravely jumped down to rescue them. However, when they were rescued, the two children had already stopped breathing. Although the people on the ferry tried all kinds of treatments, they could not be revived. The ferry then sailed to Hong Kong and immediately carried the bodies of the two children to the pier after docking. The marine police then used a black box to carry them back to the Tsim Sha Tsui Marine Police Station for filing, and then transferred them to the Peninsula Mortuary for autopsy.</p>
<p>Many Ships at Sea Encountered Danger. It was also found that during the strong wind and rain yesterday morning, a 金星 (Golden Star) boat and four sampans on the sea off Sham Shui Po and Cheung Sha Wan were also blown over. Fortunately, most of the people on the boats were men and knew how to swim, so they were able to escape from danger calmly after the accident, and there were no deaths. However, all the belongings on the boats had mostly sunk into the sea without a trace, and the losses were not small. It was found that the reason why more than ten boats were blown over was that the boat people took the boat as their home, and all their clothes and belongings were stored in the boat. Now that they have suddenly capsized, most of them were washed away by the waves and sunk to the bottom of the sea. The total loss is estimated to be two or three thousand yuan. According to experienced boat people, the sudden and violent nature of this rainstorm suggests that many ships at sea must have encountered danger. Although 海艦 (sea-going ships) have been rampant recently, the number of cargo ships traveling between Hong Kong and Macau and fishing boats going out to sea is still not small. It is difficult to avoid danger when suddenly encountering such a treacherous storm while sailing. According to the Hong Kong Observatory's weather report, such rainstorms are rare. The weather will be sunny this week, no longer cloudy, and there will be occasional sunshine. (From 7:00 AM this morning (yesterday) to 11:00 AM, the heavy rain yielded a total of 5.4 inches of water.)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Observatory's Gale Signal Locations Yesterday Morning. The newspaper published a notice from the Hong Kong Observatory, stating that in the future, when issuing Hurricane Warning Signals No. 5 to No. 10, residents should not call the observatory to inquire about news, because the observatory staff will be very busy during this time. Various signals will be displayed at the following locations: Hong Kong Observatory, Kowloon Signal Hill, 九飛碼頭 (Nine Flying Wharf), 黄捕船廠 (Huang Pu Shipyard), Marine Department, Teng Ma warship, Guizhou, Lai Chi Kok, Lei Yue Mun, Gough Hill Police Station, Star Ferry Pier (Notice Board), General Post Office (Notice Board), and Kowloon Tong. In addition, the Hong Kong Telephone Company has set up a weather warning service center.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Chaozhou Association is organized by cultural figures from Chaozhou and Shantou. Since its establishment, the association's affairs have been thriving. It is heard that it has been approved for registration by the British government. In order to enhance the strength of protecting Great Chaozhou and Shantou, it recently held a current affairs symposium and invited Mr. Xia Yan, the president of the Save-the-Nation Daily News, who has returned from an inspection of Chaozhou and Shantou, to give a lecture on the topic of "The Current New Situation in Chaozhou and Shantou."

<h3>Brigandage Rampant, Eighteen Cases of Robbery on Land and Sea Occurred in the Last Twenty Days, More Than One Hundred Bandits in Total, Only Seven People Arrested, Sixty-Two Firearms Seized, More Than Six Thousand Dollars in Property Robbed</h3>
<p>Recently, land and sea have been uneasy, and robbery cases have been frequent. Although the police authorities are making every effort to pursue the criminals, the bandits are as rampant as ever. According to investigations, in the last twenty days, from March 27 to April 13, as many as eighteen robbery cases occurred in the rivers of Kowloon and the New Territories. The number of bandits in the cases reached one hundred, and only seven people were arrested. The rest have disappeared without a trace. According to statistics, the above-mentioned robbery cases involved 101 bandits, 62 long and short firearms, and 5 sharp swords and blades. The property robbed amounted to 6,215 yuan and eight jiao. Among them, there was one tragic case that occurred on the sea off Lintangwei. A boatman, Liang Hong, was injured by 15 pirates armed with firearms, and 140 yuan was robbed. The largest loss occurred when a cargo ship on the sea off Jiuzhendao was looted by ten bandits, with 2,800 yuan being robbed. The second largest was the Hua'an Gold Shop on Shanghai Street in Mong Kok, with jewelry worth 1,667 yuan being robbed.</p>
<p>Two More Gun Theft Cases in the Peninsula</p>
<p>In addition, in the past two days, two robbery cases occurred in Mong Kok and Nathan Road within nine hours. It was found that a major theft case occurred in a Westerner's residence in Gan Jiao. Between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM yesterday morning, an unknown method was used to steal a jewelry box containing valuable jewelry worth 645 yuan. The owner went to the police station yesterday morning to report the case and asked them to investigate the whereabouts of the bandits. Secondly, a young lady was walking near Dundas Street, Nathan Road, Yau Ma Tei at 8:00 PM the night before when she was suddenly robbed of her handbag by a man in his early twenties who had been tailing her. After succeeding, he ran away. The bag contained a ladies' fountain pen worth two yuan, a pair of sunglasses worth two yuan, twenty yuan in Shanghai paper money, one ten-yuan Hong Kong bill, five one-yuan bills, a powder box, and a lipstick, totaling thirty-three yuan. It was found that the young lady's name is Zhang Lili.</p>
<p>The Situation is Treacherous, Insurance Premiums for Goods Shipped from Hong Kong to Europe Increase Sharply Again, Doubling the Original Price</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the unstable situation in Europe, insurance premiums for goods shipped from Hong Kong to various parts of Europe have repeatedly increased. Yesterday, the premiums increased again, with the newly set premiums doubling the original price. However, the British government's subsidies have made it possible to maintain reasonable insurance rates for cargo transportation between Britain and Hong Kong. The British government's subsidies to British insurance companies are actually a manifestation of safeguarding British cargo transportation. It is believed that British insurers will be able to cooperate with the government. The increase in premiums is limited to shipping cargo on merchant ships in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers' Delegation Returns to Hong Kong, Three Days in Macau</h3>
<p>— Jing Nan</p>
<p>Ye Lanquan Talks About the Gains of This Trip</p>
<p>Feature</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Manufacturers' Macau Inspection Delegation, after inspecting Macau for three days, bid farewell yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to the destination for future industrial development. The departure was amidst wind and rain, symbolizing the fate of the Chinese nation, shaking the hearts of every member of the delegation.</p>
<p>The inspection delegation spent three days attending two banquets, three tea parties, and visiting more than five local government officials and overseas Chinese leaders. This short three days is certainly not enough to survey factory sites, inspect general conditions, and establish overseas Chinese national capital. However, this move by the inspection delegation has two facts that have clearly unfolded before everyone, demanding our attention: First, the issue of overseas Chinese investment in the motherland's industry after the war; second, the issue of developing rear-area production and enhancing resistance strength during the war. However, let's just briefly mention these two issues here, and I will talk about the gains of the three-day inspection.</p>
<p>On the return voyage, many people congratulated the delegation leader, Mr. Ye Lanquan. The success of his leadership this time, at the very least, has two points worth mentioning: (1) further strengthening the unity of the Hong Kong and Macau compatriots; (2) the good spirit of the delegation members made friendly countries recognize the greatness and progress of the Chinese nation. These two points are what the old inspection delegation said about the views of the Macau compatriots and the Portuguese. It also did two other good things: one was donating hundreds of yuan to the refugees in the Macau refugee camp, and the second was donating 500 yuan to the 無原 工藝學校 (Orphanage Technical School) to build a "Hong Kong Manufacturers' Inspection Delegation Memorial Hall." As for whether the original purpose of this trip has been fully achieved, although it is not yet possible to fully determine, I have heard that a glass factory and a sulfuric acid factory have decided to set up in Macau. These two factories were embraced because Guangzhou fell.</p>
<p>Chairman Ye said on the ship about his impressions of this trip, "The Macau government welcomes our investment. I think 仔 (Taipa) is a suitable place to set up a factory, but the most important issue still needs to wait a week before all the matters can be decided. This is the issue of buying land, because legally buying land in Macau requires registration by a Portuguese person. Now, Mr. Liang Houyuan says that this legal procedure no longer exists. Even so, we still need to wait for Mr. Liang to draw up the land drawings for us to see in a week before making a decision. We ourselves also need to wait for each factory to report the opinions they have obtained."</p>
<p>The Macau government has expressed its best efforts to provide various conveniences to the manufacturers' requests, such as reducing water and electricity fees, and the restrictions on the age and working hours of workers. These can be said to be the definite restrictions that the inspection delegation knows about. There are only a few conditions for setting up a factory there, and many members of the delegation may already have good ideas in mind for inspection. Among the members, one who has expertise and experience in setting up factories proposed the following points, which I will write down as the ending of this article as a reference for everyone: The conditions required for a place to be a central area for industrial implementation are roughly as follows: (1) raw materials are easily obtained, (2) close to the market, (3) convenient transportation, (4) availability of manpower, (5) other general conveniences for setting up a factory.</p>
<h3>A Jubilant Hong Kong Weekend</h3>
<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon has arrived. The air in the city center, "Victoria City," is thick with tension.</p>
<p>Clerks, both big and small, in foreign firms, government offices, and banks are busy finishing up their work and "getting off work."</p>
<p>The factories' "blood-guzzling mouths" of gates also open, spewing out thousands of exhausted laborers.</p>
<p>School students, both boys and girls, hop around like sparrows, carrying their schoolbags home, filled with boundless joy as they enjoy a day and a half of vacation.</p>
<p>On the roads, traffic is particularly dense, with cars, buses, and trams forming strings, coming and going, interwoven. Clerks, workers, students, men, women, like a tide, surge to and fro, all revealing hurried attitudes, running along with urgent steps.</p>
<p>In the splendid restaurants, wealthy merchants, tycoons, compradores, senior officials, and high-class refugees fill the seats. Ordinary teahouses and dining rooms are also packed with clerks, workers, and students. Some leisurely enjoy a more substantial lunch, because today is Saturday, and there is no need to work in the afternoon, no need to rush. Others eat even more hastily, more "carelessly," because today is Saturday afternoon, there is no need to work, but they are in a hurry to find entertainment, to seek amusement.</p>
<p>It's almost 2:30 PM. People are packed in front of the movie theaters. On the advertising posters, half-naked beauties, displaying full, snow-white thighs, beckon to gentlemen, wives, young ladies, and young masters.</p>
<p>The 2:30 PM, 5:15 PM, and 7:15 PM seats are all sold out, and the 9:30 PM ones will definitely be sold out too. "Seats are Full" signs hang all over every box office of every theater.</p>
<p>The "Special Horse Races," held once every week, naturally attract a considerable number of citizens looking for weekend entertainment.</p>
<p>In Happy Valley, there are thousands of wealthy merchants and tycoons, thousands of Chinese and foreign gentlemen, high-class refugees, and even ordinary citizens who are unwilling to pass up a chance at fortune. They also come to the racecourse to gamble on luck with the wealthy. They are not just seeking entertainment, they are seeking enjoyment, and even hoping to get rich. Money leads the horses, the horses lead the people, chasing, chasing, everyone is chasing after money.</p>
<p>Not far from the racecourse is the football field. Speaking of football, everyone knows how the "fans" feel about football. For the wealthy, spending a few dollars is nothing. But there are also many ordinary fans who sell a set of clothes to buy a ticket to "watch the game." It is said that a certain market vendor, both father and son being fans, would not "open their stall" whenever there was a football match, even skipping business to watch the game.</p>
<p>Since local fans are so enthusiastic, the soccer teams that came to seek refuge are not to be outdone. The degree of their "obsession" is not low, so every weekend football match is packed with people. Before 3 PM, Happy Valley or Caroline Hill is surrounded, not a drop of water can leak through.</p>
<p>The tea dances from 5 PM to 7 PM are of course a lively affair on Saturdays, and young gentlemen will not miss them. The tempting, exciting jazz music has long intoxicated this group of city children on the dance floor.</p>
<p>7 PM arrives, and the black curtain of night envelops Hong Kong Island. "The devil's sunshine"—the lights and neon tubes!—release gentle, seductive, and stimulating rays, the time for finding happiness has arrived, and the prelude to nightlife is played loudly by jazz bands.</p>
<p>Restaurants and dining rooms are even more lively than at noon. The more popular "mahjong games" also begin "battling" in every "hall" and club of every restaurant. The sound of mahjong tiles, "smack, smack, clatter, clatter," will not stop until 2 AM on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The telephone lines of every restaurant and every hotel are connected to the telephone lines of every "tour guide agency." The small rooms in hotels and the curtained booths in restaurants are all places where female tour guides "guide" guests on "tours."</p>
<p>The gaudily dressed tour guide girls are busy with the incessantly ringing telephones.</p>
<p>After 8 PM, the dance halls become tense again. The elastic girls who sell their waists and thighs all know that Saturday evenings are particularly busy, and everyone wants to get more dance tickets, sit at more tables, more…</p>
<p>In several quiet corners of the city, under the dim light of the streetlamps, maids dressed in black are busy accompanying goddesses dressed in colorful clothes and thick makeup to do their pitiful deeds.</p>
<p>Goddesses are the pitiful daughters of the city. Among them, there are even girls as young as thirteen or fourteen!</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, when the "Salvation Army" held its annual meeting, when discussing the issue of "child prostitution," the chairman made this conclusion: "They simply have no choice other than prostitution or starvation…!"</p>
<p>The corruption of nightlife also erodes the lives of laborers—</p>
<p>On Saturday nights, mahjong parlors are particularly prosperous. These lower-class parlors are mostly ordinary shops, inside which are placed ten or eight square tables, each with an electric light. Mahjong tiles or "tien gow" cards are placed on the tables. Anyone can go in to "play cards" as long as you pay a certain handling fee. This fee is a percentage taken from the "stakes" of the gambling, called "drawing water." If you don't have four people, their "staff" can join in to make up the numbers.</p>
<p>They play mahjong with "scattered calculations"—"earth banker"—even if you only have twenty cents, you can go in and shuffle a few "hands." If you lose, you can run away; if you win, you can keep playing. Because of this, even people with very low incomes are attracted and lose everything.</p>
<p>Gambling is probably the only entertainment for the lower classes (?). They gamble head-over-heels until dawn.</p>
<p>Businesses parasitic on gambling, like small coffee shops, small ice rooms, "cigarette stalls," "red pill halls," lower-class private prostitute dens… are also prospering and crowded.</p>
<p>Perhaps the five-and-a-half days of mechanical life have numbed their weariness (?). Weekends in Hong Kong are times of wild joy and decadence. Once Saturday afternoon arrives, everyone forgets everything, forgets the war, forgets themselves, forgets others, indulging in joy and reveling in it. Until the early morning of Sunday arrives.</p>
<p>Many people don't get out of bed until noon on Sunday.</p>

<h3>Ours</h3>
<p>— Jin Shan</p>
<p>—— Regarding the China Salvation Drama Troupe ——</p>
<p>For the past twenty months, we have been engaged in dramatic work in rural war zones. This has made us deeply aware that, in order for drama to have a significant impact on the war of resistance, it must be closely linked to real life. The bloody reality has taught everyone, and naturally every drama worker, that to progress and grow, one must dissolve oneself into the war of resistance. We are faced with only two paths: growth or annihilation. Trying to be clever in between will inevitably be discarded by the times.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not unique to drama; it applies to all work.</p>
<p>In August of the year before last (1937), we departed from Shanghai, passing through the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong… We saw many aspects of the situation in the war. These situations told us that everything is in motion, every worker in every department, every civilian, is moving forward, is doing their utmost to contribute to the war of resistance. China is accelerating its progress, accelerating its growth.</p>
<p>All the phenomena of the twenty-month war of resistance have given us a firm conviction, guaranteeing our certain victory in the future. This is an immutable truth, not to be doubted in the slightest by anyone. We should grasp this truth and intensify our struggle!</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, in the Nanyue Conference, pointed out the current stage of the second phase of the war of resistance: "Politics is more important than military affairs," "Propaganda is more important than combat." This fully demonstrates the importance of cultural work. We, who are engaged in cultural work, should take this instruction as our guide, follow in the footsteps of those who have gone before us, and strive to work diligently.</p>
<p>Now, we are about to conclude our twenty months of work in China and head abroad to complete another mission: to conduct a more widespread and concrete propaganda campaign among overseas Chinese regarding the heroic achievements of our army since the war of resistance, the great strength displayed by all sectors in the war of resistance, the situation of military-civilian cooperation, and the military and political progress. This aims to consolidate the overseas Chinese' confidence in victory in the war of resistance, enhance their enthusiasm for the war of resistance, and expand the overseas Chinese salvation movement, so that those with strength contribute strength, and those with money contribute money; to expose and destroy the acts of cultural and religious destruction, indiscriminate bombing, the use of poison gas, and the endangerment of foreign nationals. And to expose the ambition of the × warlords to annex China, monopolize the Far East market, and exclude the economic interests of various countries in China, the barbaric act of violating international conventions, the conspiracy to provoke world peace, and the fact of their gradual decline, and to explain the reasons why they will ultimately be defeated by the new China, in order to promote more practical assistance from the international community. At the same time, to raise 500,000 yuan in donations to establish ten wounded soldier reception stations, five wounded soldier hospitals, one general station for wartime cultural supplies, ten branch stations, and to establish ten vocational training centers for disabled soldiers and the families of martyrs, in order to partially solve the urgent problems we saw while working in the war zone. This task is indeed quite arduous. But we are willing to make our best efforts to complete it. The more effort we put in, the more joy we have, and the more small contributions we make to the motherland in the war of resistance. However, this contribution must be accomplished with the help of our beloved overseas Chinese. We firmly believe that overseas Chinese will give us great help in our work!</p>
<p>We come from the flames of war, and we can never forget the brothers and sisters of our motherland who are struggling hard. We plan to complete this task quickly and return to our motherland quickly, return to the front lines, and participate in the final decisive battle with our heroic brothers! (April 10th at the Salvation Society)</p>

<h3>On Stage Techniques</h3>
<p>— Lu Dun</p>
<p>Eightfold Tone and Punctuation</p>
<p>The life of a spoken drama lies in the dialogue. It is the duty of the actor to control and manipulate the audience's emotions by reading the lines in a pleasing manner. This, of course, is achieved through the skillful use of intonation and cadence. But how should intonation and cadence be used? This requires much study.</p>
<p>The main purpose of an actor's recitation is to fully express the meaning of each line, which is related to intonation. However, the use of intonation is not only about expressing the meaning of the words, but mainly about conveying emotions.</p>
<p>The use of intonation in words and sentences depends not only on the rhymes of the words, but also on finding the places in the sentence that should be emphasized, which is called "stress." The location of the stress is often the central point of a sentence. For example, in the sentence: "Zhang San was killed," the stress is on the word "killed," because this word is the most important meaning in the whole sentence, and it must be expressed slightly exaggeratedly. It is from this stress that the intonation of the sentence is determined.</p>
<p>At the same time, an error in the stress can often cause the same sentence to have different meanings. For example, "What are you doing?" Only these few words, but if the position of the stress is different, it can have different effects: if the stress is on "what," the meaning is "You once told me you were doing something, but what exactly is it?" If the stress is on "are," it becomes "What are you doing right now?" If the stress is on "you," it has a bit of a scolding tone. If the stress is on "doing," it becomes "We have already heard your opinion, but what have you really done?" If the emphasis is not on any one word, then the whole sentence is important and becomes a tone of request.</p>
<p>Therefore, to accurately express the meaning of dialogue, appropriate stress is necessary. Incorrect stress can distort the author's original intention. To solve the difficulties in stress, actors must study in advance when reading the lines, find the location of the stress, and then practice it.</p>
<p>A passage of dialogue is mostly composed of several sentences, so attention must be paid to the division of sentences.</p>
<p>In those passages of dialogue composed of several sentences, first look at the punctuation of each sentence. Ordinary commas require a slight pause, colons and semicolons can pause a little longer, but this is not fixed, and must be determined by the momentum and emotions; but the shortest pause between sentences is very important, because this is where the expression lies. Some actors often pause too long in these places, and the duration of each pause is average, which is not good, because then there is no rhythm of fast and slow. Sometimes, a long passage of dialogue, although divided into several sentences, can often achieve an effect by reciting it in one breath without pausing, which is most often used in comedy.</p>
<p>However, the so-called reciting in one breath without pausing does not mean that there is no pause at all between sentences, but that the pause is very short, and the tone of voice is used as punctuation, so that the audience can understand and distinguish the sentences one by one.</p>
<p>An incorrect division of sentences can often cause sentences to have different meanings. A common saying can be used as an example, such as "Road not passable, no urinating here." The place to divide the sentence is the word "passable," when reciting, the pause is after the word "passable." But if the place to pause is mistaken when reciting, and it is recited as: "Road not passable, cannot pass, urinate here," then the meaning of the whole sentence is completely reversed. Therefore, the place to divide and pause the sentence when reciting should be paid special attention to. Sometimes, even if it is a very long sentence, if there is no pause sign in the middle, then do not pause randomly in the middle, but must recite it in one breath. For the sake of expression, you can only emphasize the stress, or lengthen the sound of one or two words - but you cannot stop completely.</p>
<p>Some actors often recite every two words in a sentence like they are giving a speech, which not only lacks emotion, but is also unnatural, unlike speaking, and is very annoying to listen to.</p>
<p>In short, reciting lines is the main homework for actors, and much practice is necessary. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of the Youth Drama Association's Welcome Meeting for the China Salvation Drama Troupe</h3>
<p>— Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>Comrades, let us join hands closely in our work!</p>
<p>This is an unforgettable joyous gathering for Hong Kong youth drama workers!</p>
<p>In order to welcome our warriors, to welcome the comrades who have been fighting in the flames of war in the motherland for nineteen months, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association initiated a welcome meeting for the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" by all the youth drama groups in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The groups that attended included the Hongbai Drama Troupe, the Xinsheng Drama Society, the LuFeng Drama Society, the Gong Drama Society, the Honglan Drama Troupe, the Rendou Drama Troupe, the Amateur Drama Troupe, the Tiemo Drama Troupe, the Ant Children's Drama Troupe, the Pioneer Children's Drama Troupe, the Qingnian Tongle Society, the Dingchou Drama Society, the Cyclone Drama Society, the Xuede Lizhi Society, the Zhonghua Bookstore Drama Troupe, the Huiqing Drama Group, the Propaganda Training Class Drama Group, the Youth Corps, the Guangda Drama Society, and the XueZhen Western District Drama Group, with a total of three or four hundred comrades, a record-breaking joyous gathering for Hong Kong drama workers.</p>
<p>The auditorium of South China Middle School was crowded and joyful. Everyone was intertwined with excitement and enthusiasm. Everyone was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the distinguished guests, with a deep sense of reverence and heroic admiration in their hearts!</p>
<p>Finally, amidst warm applause and standing ovations, our heroic warriors - the comrades of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, a group of more than twenty people, appeared at our grand meeting.</p>
<p>An extreme excitement and fervent emotion floated among us—</p>
<p>The young chairman wearing glasses stood up and gave a concise opening speech, followed by Mr. Lu Fu, who gave a detailed report and introduction to the growth and struggle of the "China Salvation Drama Troupe," allowing everyone to understand more deeply and clearly the history and achievements of these warriors.</p>
<p>What a rush of rapid and enthusiastic applause this was! Our heroic pioneers, the distinguished guests of tonight, Mr. Jin Shan, stood tall before us in a heroic posture.</p>
<p>Filled with excitement and solemnity, yet burning with passion and joy, with a loud and moving tone, like an actor on stage, like a warrior on the battlefield, he began his speech—</p>
<p>First, he reported that they started working in the interior from the organization of the Shanghai Salvation Drama Propaganda Second Team after the start of the August 13th War of Resistance, and successively passed through Suzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hankou, Shangcheng, Macheng, and then went south along the Yuehan Railway, transferring to Hunan and entering Guangxi. During the nineteen months, they lived like soldiers and farmers. During the course of their work, they understood and firmly believed that China was saveable, and that China's war of resistance would achieve final victory!</p>
<p>He pointed out the determination and heroism, perseverance and composure of the political work youth and drama work youth in the vast war zone. Therefore, he emphasized: What is needed now is not "movie stars," but youth salvation workers who participate in the war of resistance!</p>
<p>—A burst of warm applause made everyone more invigorated to look up to him.</p>
<p>Because those who attended this evening were all young workers engaged in the anti-Japanese drama movement, he specifically pointed out the power and effect of drama in the war of resistance, and used four or five examples of work reports to illustrate it.</p>
<p>He reported in detail how drama was used to move and explain to a big landlord who killed without batting an eye to participate in the war of resistance, to mobilize the masses to participate in the guerrilla team, and to transform children who were acting as local guides for the Japanese and real traitors. These are all valuable experiences and moving deeds.</p>
<p>Then he resolutely said that the content of drama at the current stage should be realistic, vivid, rich, emotional, with flesh and blood, without emptiness or illusion, completely expressed in real life. True art represents the soul of the country, and new art is born in the national revolution!</p>
<p>"Why is salvation drama developing so vigorously and widely? How are each of the young workers engaged in salvation drama fighting in the motherland…?" Mr. Jin Shan asked powerfully, and everyone silently and solemnly looked up at him: "Each worker has a high degree of enthusiasm and a deep political understanding. In addition to busy work and a small amount of sleep, everyone is immersed in studying the development of the war of resistance situation and the changes in international politics. Their lives are absolutely popularized, without wastefulness or decadence, and they are integrated with farmers and soldiers. The content of the work is the most realistic, without any empty thoughts, and the workers in the war zone are absolutely united without any friction!"</p>
<p>He eloquently struck the hearts of everyone with a powerful tone, waving his solid fist in a dramatic pose. Finally, he strongly declared:</p>
<p>"Only unity can exert the greatest strength. At present, it is necessary for a large number of young workers to go to the interior to mobilize the masses to participate in the national war of resistance, to go to the war zones, and to go to the countryside to learn. Soldiers, farmers, and workers are our best learners!</p>
<p>The heroic posture of the warriors tempered in the great national revolutionary war of resistance is unforgettable for everyone. Mr. Jin Shan moved everyone in this way.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Ying then stood in front of us. She smiled, she was strong, she was dignified, she began to report the work process of their team. The work was heavy and busy, but the life was arduous and persevering. They lived in civilian houses and temples, and ate the same food as the soldiers and farmers. They have performed more than seven hundred times, and have never sold tickets for their own group.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang reported the experience of the work in detail. Finally, she said with composure: Arm our spirit, and make a strong struggle in our own work position!</p>
<p>Again, there was a burst of rapid and enthusiastic applause. Mr. Mo Shu followed Mr. Wang Ying's concluding remarks and stood up. Mr. Lin is a person with extremely rich political and military cultivation. Therefore, he started by taking Jingwei's "give an example" to severely criticize it, and very correctly analyzed the death of Zeng Shi, and Wang Jingwei's traitorous country, saying it happily and vividly, making everyone feel very angry.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin also correctly used numerical statistics to confirm the losses of the × people in the war. This loss is causing the × people to move towards collapse and failure! China's war of resistance is to strive for a comprehensive victory, not a struggle for one point or one line. As long as every citizen of the Republic of China is a heroic fighter, then the final victory is ours!</p>
<p>Fan Zheng, the only young warrior of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, stood firmly on the stage with his chin as Mr. Lin introduced him amidst the long and warm applause.</p>
<p>He is no more than thirteen years old at most. He escaped tragically after the fall of the Northeast. However, he did not want to be a small slave or a small refugee. He wanted revenge, he wanted to fight, so he grew up heroically in the flames of war in the motherland.</p>
<p>He reported the posture of the children's drama groups fighting in the motherland, such as the New An Travel Troupe, the Children's Drama Troupe, and the Xiamen Children's Salvation Drama Troupe, etc. Finally, he described the heroic work of killing × by the Anhui Anti-Japanese Children's Corps, which was so moving!</p>
<p>Finally, there was also a speech by educator Fang Xingrang, who participated in the grand meeting. Mr. Jin Shan also earnestly hoped that the Hong Kong drama movement would strengthen its work and unite!</p>
<p>Under the strong light, everyone's face was shining. No, it was excited and very red. The oranges, peanuts and biscuits on the table had long been exploited and turned into residual dregs. We are intertwined in excitement, laughter, and fun.</p>
<p>Interesting after-dinner entertainment intensified everyone's enthusiasm and excitement. Wang Ying's "Lugou Bridge", Fan Zheng's "Wang Jingwei", Zhu Guoping's "Children's Pioneer Song", the Salvation Drama Troupe's "We Are Young Drama Team Members", the Ant Drama Troupe's "Sing the Eight Hundred Brave Soldiers"...</p>
<p>In the chorus of "March of the Volunteers", everyone's heart was burning with fervent hope - the motherland is embarking on a victorious future in the struggle!</p>

<h3>A Few Points to Note When Criticizing Movies</h3>
<p>— Bai Xue</p>
<p>With the advent of movies, criticism inevitably follows. Every viewer of a film, and even those who haven't seen it, are often critical of movies, regardless of their critical attitude. The most easily noticed are film reviews that are written and published. Everyone can criticize movies, but few can make appropriate and fitting criticisms. Many can write film reviews, but few are of value. This article is truly a "critique of critiques," merely outlining a few points to keep in mind when criticizing movies:</p>
<p>First, if you want to criticize a film, you must have seen it.</p>
<p>——This point may seem like a joke, but in fact, it is the first essential step in criticizing a movie. For example, the film reviews that appear in several well-known Hong Kong newspapers on the day a film is released are mostly written without having seen the film. The authors mostly refer to criticisms from foreign newspapers and magazines, translate them, and then add their own predicted opinions to write the film review. In fact, it is not entirely appropriate to call this kind of writing "film review"; it is best to call it "movie-watching guide" or "new film introduction." But many of these articles have reference value, and writing them may even be more laborious than writing a review after seeing the film. However, because it is a prediction before seeing the film, or taking someone else's criticism as one's own, errors are inevitable. Furthermore, very few people criticize Cantonese films in general. Criticizing something requires that thing to have value worth criticizing. But even the worst thing has its own value to be criticized; the worse it is, the more it needs accurate criticism to correct it. The reason why Cantonese films lack criticism is not in their inherent value, but because "to criticize a film, you must have seen it," and those with the ability to criticize rarely have the energy to do the "watching" work.</p>
<p>Second, if you want to criticize a movie, you must understand movies.</p>
<p>——One often hears, "He doesn't understand at all; what is he criticizing?" In fact, there are few movie experts, but many movie critics. Among them, some pretend to know what they don't, but most base their arguments on what they do understand. Those who understand little make superficial criticisms. Those who understand more make specialized criticisms. Generally speaking, most people can easily understand whether the actors' performances are good or bad, or whether the story is good or bad. As for the use of techniques and the creation of atmosphere, although the audience is affected, most people do not understand them. Therefore, the former is often criticized, while the latter is rarely criticized. The reason is that they know what happens, but not why. "A money-making film is not necessarily good, and a good film does not necessarily make money." On the one hand, this is caused by the "determinism" of film merchants. (Merchants guess that a certain type of film is too popular based on audience psychology, so they reduce publicity and release it on "cold" days, which is not necessarily the case.) On the other hand, it is also because the good points of good films cannot be "understood" by the audience. For example, the main audience of Cantonese films in general—aunties, older sisters, female workers, wives—and the general audience that is considered low-class, do they understand movies? No.　Do they not have criticisms? They do. Perhaps they can criticize a certain "folk tale" film for having the wrong story, precisely because they　have seen the "folk tale" wood-fish book, which enables them to understand that the "folk tale" film failed to capture the essence of the wood-fish book. And precisely because they do not, or cannot, make deeper distinctions and criticisms, they are able to be interested in Cantonese films in general. This range of "understanding" is very broad. From a film's subject matter, actors, director, sets, and even the smallest props, to the workers' attitudes, past achievements, technical applications, and other aspects, the more one understands, the more common sense and specialized knowledge one has, the more grounded the criticism will be, and the more valuable the criticism itself will be. Many Chinese film reviews do not truly understand films, and have never produced authoritative film critics. Of course, there are other reasons, but the main one is whether they "understand" enough.</p>
<p>Third, movie criticism should be unbiased, not generalized, and not blinded by publicity.</p>
<p>Movie criticism must not be blinded by publicity. Critics　are inherently individuals, and ultimately cannot avoid "what I think," but the attitude of criticism must be relatively objective and serious, and must not be biased. Criticizing good or bad based on personal preferences. For example, I like a certain star, I like a certain type of film, that film is the work of a great director, or someone is incorrigible. These can only be used as references for criticism, not as the basis for criticism. Famous directors often have undesirable works, and minor actors often have remarkable performances. Movie criticism cannot be generalized:　for example, Chinese movies are not as good as foreign movies, but one cannot write off Chinese movies as hopeless. Although the United States has good movies, Hollywood is really quite inept; money has created everything. Their limited success is not enough to compensate for their vast consumption. The best products account for no more than 20 percent. Chinese films are indeed far behind, but the little achievement of Chinese films has been struggled out of poverty and hardship. The capital is small, the machinery is outdated, and its achievement can be said to have already exceeded consumption. The funds for one great Hollywood production are almost enough to buy up all the Chinese film companies with plenty to spare. If one criticizes the productions of these two countries, of course one cannot use the same perspective. "Generalization, for example, now the Shanghai production organization is able to produce valuable productions, or the Hong Kong film company is able to produce better films. Critics should give them high praise. Secondly, critics should have some ability to not be blinded by publicity policies. The publicity policies of modern movies are amazing. The best-selling movies are not necessarily the best movies, but often "sensational movies." The audience is often influenced by the sensationalism of publicity? And to see a movie, sensational movies are not necessarily good movies,　sometimes even affecting viewers' ability to distinguish, and they take it for granted that it is a good movie. These are the points that should be paid the most attention to when criticizing movies, and must never be affected by the mentality,　and people blindly follow what others say. For example, a certain costume drama is constantly exaggerating the grandeur of its sets,　which is not necessarily a bad thing, but if it is grand to the point of being inexplicable without any research, the critic should discriminate against it.</p>
<p>Fourth, movie criticism must have unique insights.</p>
<p>Whether criticizing the merits of a film from the meaning expressed in its content or the achievements in its techniques, the main thing is to have unique insights and be able to go deep in order to become a valuable criticism. Merely using a rote-learned style to criticize how the director's techniques are, whether the actors are experienced, whether the photography is beautiful, etc., is really not enough to express oneself. For example, if you can point out the shortcomings of a film, that is certainly good;　if you can further explain how to make up for this shortcoming, wouldn't that be even better?</p>
<p>The Drama Association Welcomes Xia Yan to a Symposium</p>
<p>To be Held at South China Middle School at 7 PM Tonight</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Youth Drama Association is a unified organization of more than 20 youth drama groups in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Its lively demeanor reveals the enthusiasm of youth, and also symbolizes the bright future of the drama movement. After warmly welcoming the China Salvation Drama Troupe, it is scheduled to hold a symposium to welcome Mr. Xia Yan, advisor to the association, at 7 PM today (the 16th), which will discuss "The Current Stage of the Chinese Drama Movement", "Playwriting", and "New Prospects for the Hong Kong Wartime Drama Movement". Mr. Cai Chusheng, Mr. Situ Huimin and other gentlemen will also be invited to participate in the discussion. There is sure to be a lively scene. It is heard that the association welcomes those who love drama to attend and participate.</p>
<p>The First Theater Troupe is Reborn</p>
<p>Officially Established on the 18th</p>
<p>The Guangdong Drama Association is a newly opened flower of drama in the South, composed of more than 20 drama groups in Guangzhou, with more than 500 members. Hu Chunbing, Zhao Rulin, Zhong Qinan, Luo Haisha, etc., are enthusiastic leaders of the association.</p>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, these more than 500 drama workers scattered to various places to work, some serving in the army. A part of the members who arrived in Hong Kong, in order to continue their work, formed the "Guangdong Drama Association Hong Kong Branch" at the end of last year, and continued to promote the development of the work with great effort in difficult times.</p>
<p>The new and concrete expression is the reorganization of the "First Theater Troupe," which was originally resolved by the Guangdong Drama Association's board of directors, under the leadership of the couple Hu Bingchun and Tang Shuming. This can be said to be a surge of heat in the drama movement.</p>
<p>Now the troupe's address has been selected, and the inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held at 1 PM on Wednesday, the 18th of this month, so that work can be carried out quickly. It is said that the famous plays prepared for the first performance include Hu Chunbing's "Chinese Men," Xia Yan's "One Year," You Jing's "Shanghai Rooftop," "Lust Demon," "The Inspector General," and "The Great Thunderstorm," and other famous plays. Workers who have come out of the fire of war will surely do a good job. We extend our most sincere respect and wish them a rebirth and growth!</p>
<p>Children's Drama Association Established</p>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony on the Evening of the 17th</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Children's Drama Association is the highest unified organization of children's drama in Hong Kong. It is responsible for the two major missions of connecting the feelings of various troupes and promoting the development of the children's drama movement. After active preparations by children's drama troupes such as Ant, Pioneer, Qiangzhong, Central, Xue Zhen, and Youth Co-op, various items have been generally prepared. It has been decided to hold the inauguration ceremony at the Central Women's School on Portland Street at 7 PM on the 17th of this month. Due to environmental reasons, the "Long Live Children" grand performance, which has been postponed again and again, will also be able to meet the audience. According to the association's organization, under the general meeting, there is a board of directors and advisors. The standing directors are divided into five departments: (1) The general affairs department has documentation, finance, public relations, and affairs sections. (2) The organization department has transportation, friendship, investigation, registration, and other sections. (3) The theater affairs department has four officers. (4) The research department has editing, technology, seminars, library, and other sections. The publicity department has publishing, art, acrobatics, and singing sections. The new children's drama movement will surely have a surprising achievement in the near future.</p>
<p>"The Cry of Humanity"</p>
<p>An English Film Being Shot During the Day</p>
<p>The first English film "The Cry of Humanity," co-produced by International Company and Zhenguang Company, has been introduced in a short article in our previous issues. Now it is heard that the film will be shot in the coming days, because the production of English films is still a pioneering work. The participants in this work have always been known for their cautious production attitude, and the subject matter taken by the film, as well as any other aspect, is no less than a "giant film" type, so the preparation period has been particularly long. The most important thing is the compilation, staging, translation, and modification of the script, which has taken a long time. In the production of English films, there are also various difficulties that must be overcome in advance, and then the work on the set can be carried out. It is said that the staff of the film are: Luo Mingyou as the producer, Huang Guoyin as the production director, Zhong Shigen as the screenwriter, director　　, Li Minwei as the technical director, and Zhou Daming as the photographer; Pei Chong, Tu Hengfu, Fang Meichao, and Tong Zhenmin will collaborate on the theater affairs. The main actors are Zhang Yi, Li Zhuozhuo, Chen Yunshang, Wu Chufan, and Lu Dun. The film is based on the struggle between a large refugee group and aggressors, epidemics, and selfishness during the War of Resistance, showing the story of one person. It is heard that the director has decided to go to Fanling first to shoot scenes of refugee life. It is expected to take at least three or four months to complete!</p>
<p>Famous Play "Phoenix City"</p>
<p>Many Troupes Are Rehearsing</p>
<p>"Phoenix City" and "The Devil's Den" are the "twin masterpieces of drama" that emerged after the War of Resistance, but "Phoenix City" is more worth reading because it is a very mature script depicting the positive (The Devil's Den is mainly the negative) War of Resistance, and it puts the correct theory into popular language and has gone through a skilled process of imagery.</p>
<p>Phoenix City is a script by young playwright Wu Zuguang depicting Miao Kexiu's heroic actions in the Volunteer Army and her martyrdom. He has successfully written a great and difficult-to-handle film village into this script, and its performance at the Chongqing National Academy of Drama has further proved its stage adaptability.</p>
<p>Since the Living Bookstore printed the script, the whole country has been vying to perform it. The Hong Kong Chinese Clerical Association, directed by Li Chenfeng, is performing it. The China Travel Agency is rehearsing it in Mandarin, and the Red and White Drama Troupe is rehearsing it in Cantonese. The China Travel Agency has scheduled charity performances at the Queen's Theater on the fourth and fifth nights of next month, and the others are also actively preparing to perform it in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Call for Historical Materials on Spoken Drama by the National Academy of Drama</h3>
<p>The spoken drama movement has been around for 30 years. In these 30 years, spoken drama has grown up in hard struggle. The historical facts that have been experienced should be left as valuable records. On the one hand, it is to recall the achievements of the predecessors in the drama circle who worked hard to create it, and on the other hand, it is to serve as a model for the latecomers to continue to struggle.</p>
<p>The collection and compilation of historical materials on spoken drama has not yet been managed by the government. Although there have been efforts by one or two drama lovers, they have been limited by the energy and financial resources of individuals, and the handling may be incomplete. Moreover, in today's world of war, the preservation and collection of historical materials are extremely difficult. Therefore, in view of the dangerous situation at the moment, our school has specially approved the Ministry of Education to set up a "Editorial Committee for the History of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement" to formally engage in the collection, compilation, printing, and distribution of historical materials on the Chinese spoken drama movement.</p>
<p>In the past 30 years of the spoken drama movement, there have been a number of drama schools, drama troupes, drama people, and general schools and groups that have been involved in drama activities as a sideline. Whether they express themselves in writing or are active on the stage, they have left many valuable achievements. Among these achievements, whether they are printed matter, handwritten matter, photographs, or even oral accounts by the parties concerned, are all materials that should be adopted in the history of spoken drama.</p>
<p>Now the work of collecting historical materials has begun. It is hoped that all public and private drama schools, theaters, short-term drama training classes, amateur drama troupes, professional drama troupes, and mobile propaganda teams and drama troupes of party, government, military, educational, and cultural organizations, who have participated in drama activities in the past and present, will send us detailed and accurate information about the process of their establishment, the form of organization, the source of funds, the achievements of their work, and the solutions to technical problems. It is also requested that the predecessors in the drama circle and those in charge of the spoken drama movement in various places send us detailed information about the process of their personal advocacy of spoken drama, either in writing or in person. In particular, all documents related to spoken drama, such as founding declarations, organizational charters, plans, budget tables, meeting minutes, work reports, commemorative publications, rosters of all staff and actors, photographs, signatures, files, documents, drama books (theoretical history and scripts (drama publications (single books, magazines, periodicals, or newspapers, attached to drama　)) and wall newspapers, advertisements, ticket samples, power books, special issues, stage appearances, newspaper and periodical special issues or appendices (advertisements, reports, and criticisms of performances), and all other documents and classics related to drama, whether they are letterpress, lithographic, mimeographed, handwritten, photographed, clippings, old, new, intact, or damaged, are all earnestly hoped to be donated and collected or borrowed. Please send the items to "Editorial Committee for the History of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement, National Academy of Drama, No. 12 Ranjiakang Lane" for compilation into a rich manuscript of the history of the Chinese spoken drama movement. We sincerely hope for this!</p>
<p>Sincerely, National Academy of Drama</p>

<h3>International Football Final Today - Chinese and Portuguese Teams Meet to Compete for the Championship - Kickoff at 4 PM at So Kon Po Stadium - Our Chinese Team is Strong and Can Regain the Top Spot</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the beginning of spring, there has been little rainfall, and the water shortage problem on the island is quite serious. Yesterday, spring thunder rumbled, shocking all plants and trees. Heavy rain poured down, and the landscape changed color. Fortunately, it was sweet dew from the willow branches, sprinkling all over the world, saving people from suffering.</p>
<p>However, yesterday's football spectacle was ruined by the heavy rain, and the good time was missed. What a day—the championship battle in the First Division League, forced to be temporarily suspended due to the heavens crying. Who is the owner of the famous flower, and the matter is still unclear, also teaching the footballing masses to be bored and spend this Saturday in vain, seeking pleasure in mischief.</p>
<p>This great battle will be rescheduled to 5 PM on Wednesday, the 19th of this month. Maybe Mai Shaohan, the famous Nan Hua Nan Nei Wei general, will be able to play at that time. If so, then yesterday's rain was beneficial to Nan Hua. The Navy side, aiming for both fame and fortune, was energetic. Who would have thought that they wouldn't get several thousand dollars yesterday? That's also bad luck. However, the money is ultimately theirs. Whether they get the championship is a question.</p>
<p>If it rains again today, I am afraid that the international final will also be postponed. We hope that the heavens will be kind and not make another mistake, so that the game can start as scheduled. It will surely cause a sensation. Good things are coming, but the heavens are in control.</p>
<p>Our Chinese team certainly has the possibility of winning all six major championships this year. This is not self-aggrandizement, nor is it a dream. Observing the current situation, as long as our athletes work hard to the end, they can succeed. If we win it all, there will be no flaws. This is a great achievement that will honor our ancestors and set an example for future generations.</p>
<p>This championship was established in 1925. The silver cup was donated by the English weekly newspaper. The participating teams are limited to nationalities. At the beginning, there were four teams participating in the competition: Greater China, Portugal, England, and Scotland. Later, Ireland and Wales were added. This year, there are still five teams competing together: China, Portugal, England, Scotland, and Ireland. The right to the final has been won by the Chinese and Portuguese teams, who will meet today to determine the winner. Let's see who wins the championship.</p>
<p>The match adopts a 90-minute system, so to win, the ball skills must be excellent, and the strength must be abundant. If one is lacking, it is difficult to succeed. This year, our Chinese team has a wealth of talent, gathering troops and assembling the army, and its strength is unsurpassed for a time. It was able to defeat the Soviet army in the first battle, and then conquer the English soldiers. If we take another step and defeat the Portuguese team today, we will retain the championship.</p>
<p>The ticket revenue will be allocated for charitable purposes. The players contribute their efforts, and the fans contribute their money. It can be said that each fulfills their responsibilities. I believe that this afternoon's So Kon Po will be packed with people, and another lively scene will unfold. However, it is necessary to have clear skies so as not to affect the revenue and to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The kickoff is at 4 PM. If the two teams are still tied after the stipulated 90 minutes, there will be an additional 20 minutes to determine the winner. Tickets will start selling at around 2 PM. Fans who want to get a good seat, please arrive early.</p>
<p>Greater China Team</p>
<p>Tan Junqian, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Hou Chengbo, Li Zhaorong, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>New Recruits: Yang Zixiang, Zhuo Shijin, Zhong Huilin, Liu Shizan, Liang Bowen</p>
<p>Portugal Team</p>
<p>W Sousa, Sousa, Remedi, Irins, Bi Ludo, Maxwell, Aruves, Roger, Gao Shannu, Panila, Ma Kuishi</p>
<p>New Recruits: Ma Shaner, Jialilu, Wo Te, Shen Dushi</p>
<p>Last Christmas, the Portuguese team first played against the Irish team. At that time, the Portuguese team's lineup was very complete. Because the front line had the services of Little Gao Shannu and Jin, the progress was rapid and the connection was dense, so they were able to eliminate the Irish team with a large score of seven to one. However, now Little Gao is a guest in Xiamen, and Jin has traveled south with the East and has not returned. With the loss of these two inside forwards, the offensive power will inevitably be affected, and Big Gao Shannu may lament that he is unable to clap with one hand because he cannot get support from others.</p>
<p>Our Chinese team has also lost one or two candidates due to the East's southern tour. However, the entire front line seems to have no leaks, and its strength is stronger than the Portuguese team's, and the hope of victory is also higher.</p>
<p>Our Chinese team's front line is the most ideal. Li Huitang has the certainty of scoring, Feng Jingxiang's dribbling is skillful, Li Zhaorong is good at scouting, and they sing in harmony with each other, making them indestructible. In addition, Hou Chengtao and Deng Guangsen's swift attacks are like flying generals coming from the sky, which will surely make the Portuguese defenders unable to defend.</p>
<p>The Portuguese team's defense is mainly based on Bi Ludo, Remedi, and Maxwell, but the whole is not perfect and will definitely not be able to control our Chinese team's front line. However, I can imagine that Bi Ludo will adopt the third inside defender's defensive method to intercept Huitang, so Huitang should also use the plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain, retreating slightly, trying to induce Bi Ludo to attack, and giving Jingxiang and Zhaorong the opportunity to attack from the side.</p>
<p>Big Gao Shannu is a dangerous element and must be fierce, but the left and right inside records are not top-notch materials, and they must not be very tacit with Big Gao, which will lead to Big Gao's helpless isolation and difficulty in going deep. However, Big Gao has the ability to find a way out, and he must be suppressed with all his might.</p>
<p>The Portuguese team's wings are also agile, and the cross-center back is not bad, so we must guard against their cut-in and Big Gao's head-on attack.</p>
<p>In short, it is expected that our Chinese team will win, but it is still necessary to work hard in this serious juncture of fighting for the championship. The list of previous champions is as follows (Football Field Tai Sui):</p>
<p>1925……Scotland</p>
<p>1926……Portugal</p>
<p>1927……Scotland</p>

<h3>40 Countries to Participate in the Next World Games</h3>

<h3>A Total of Six Teams Participating in the Hong Kong Open Baseball Tournament - Registration Fee Must Be Paid Before May 1st</h3>
<p>As of now, there are six teams participating in the Hong Kong Open Baseball Tournament: Chinese Team (last year's champion), Minedenu (American ship), Western Club, MB Team, South China Club, and Hong Kong Club. The MB team is organized and paid by the Friendship Monument Manufacturing Company. Most of the personnel are members of last year's Volunteer Army baseball team, and their strength is not weak. The South China Club has not participated in baseball competitions for several years. Its reappearance this time has aroused a lot of interest among baseball audiences. It is noted that the club's strong players include Feng Jingxiang, Bao Jiaping, Zhu Guolun, Ye Zhaohua, etc., who dominated the hazelnut court in previous years, but it is not known whether they will be able to play this year. Because the South China Club already has the motive to travel south to Malaya, football players will definitely be selected to go, so the club's baseball warriors are trying to search for players. The teams participating in the competition must pay the report fee to the baseball association before May 1st in order to be valid, otherwise it will be invalid. The association is scheduled to start the competition at 2:30 PM on May 6th, when the Western Club will play against the MB team.</p>

<h3>Basketball Games Last Night: Kwong Tai Defeats Pui Ying, Second Division Lai Hang and Wah Nam Triumph; Three Second Division Games Today</h3>
<p>The Open Men's Basketball League saw Lai Hang play Ling Ying in the first Second Division game last night. Lai Hang has been dubbed undefeated since the start of this season, while Ling Ying is also quite strong. Thus, in the first half, Lai Hang only led by 38 to 20. In the second half, Lai Hang was unstoppable. Wong Lung-sik, Luk Tak-cheung, Wong Lung-wu, and others demonstrated skill in passing and stealing, while Lam Yau-pui also had excellent plays. Until the end of the game, Lai Hang won overwhelmingly with a score of 93 to 37. In the second game, Kwong Tai faced Pui Ying in the First Division. The two teams were quite evenly matched, but unfortunately, neither side put on a spectacular performance, resulting only in a chaotic match. In the end, Pui Ying lost with a score of 42 to 53. Kwong Tai's Chan Kwong-luk demonstrated skill in shooting, with nimble turns, allowing him to break through the opponent's defense. Cheng Yuk-tong's dribbling was also excellent. Players such as Ng Hsuan-chiu and Lo Tung were also steady. However, the overall team coordination was lacking, but it was still much better than Pui Ying's, allowing them to take an early lead of 25 to 14 in the first half. It was observed that Pui Ying's coordination was not close enough, and the team members fought individually. Although there were excellent opportunities, they could not respond to each other, resulting in missed chances. Furthermore, the entire team lacked skilled shooters, which contributed to their defeat. In the first half, Chau Chu-siang and Ho Yat-sum worked extremely hard and fulfilled their duties. However, forwards Poon Kam-hung and defender Lam Man-li failed to act accordingly, repeatedly missing opportunities to win. Twenty minutes before the end of the game, Yau Kwong-sip played in the center, strategizing under the opponent's basket. At the same time, both Lam and Poon became active, and once closed the gap to 34 to 38. Unfortunately, Kwan and Ho were unable to resist, and the improved situation was fleeting. At the end of the game, Kwong Tai finally won with a score of 53 to 42.</p>
<p>In the game, Chan Kwong-luk of Kwong Tai opened the scoring, Liang Jiang-qiang made one free throw and one successful shot. Pui Ying only scored with a free throw by Lam Man-li. After a long chaotic struggle, Kwong Tai took the lead with advantages of 6 to 1 and 16 to 7. Later, Cheng Yuk-tong and Lo Tung scored consecutively. Yau Kwong-sip of Pui Ying responded in turn. At the end of the first half, Kwong Tai still led with 25 to 14. In the second half, Chan Kwong-luk of Kwong Tai was unstoppable, leading further with 31 to 18 and 37 to 29. Until Lai Wan-chak showed his potential and caught up, trailing by only two points. But in an instant, Chan Kwong-luk scored several baskets in a row. Therefore, at the end of the game, Kwong Tai finally won with a score of 53 to 42.</p>
<p>In the last game, Wah Nam played Chun Cho. During the game, Chun Cho had strong morale and accurate shots. In the first half, they led with 22 to 16. However, in the second half, Wah Nam launched a courageous counterattack. Cheuk Kwok-ying and Chiu Chun-piu scored consecutively, resulting in a final score of 43 to 34, turning defeat into victory.

<h3>Today's Schedule</h3>
<p>Today, three Second Division games will be held at the YMCA gymnasium. At 3:30 PM, Hoi Kwong will play Pui Ying. At 4:30 PM, the originally scheduled First Division game between Star Island and Wah Nam has been changed to Second Division Tai Koo against Hong Yuen. At 5:30 PM, Overseas Chinese will play Morning Light. Judging by the strength of each team, Pui Ying is stronger than Hoi Kwong and has a chance of winning. Tai Koo and Hong Yuen are evenly matched, and the outcome is unpredictable. Overseas Chinese is quite strong and progressive, so Morning Light is unlikely to win. Also, admission tickets for today's games will be waived. Outside visitors are welcome.</p>
<h3>Kam Chuen Cup Table Tennis Tournament Tonight: Three Matches at Yuet Wah Table Tennis Room</h3>
<p>The Kam Chuen Cup table tennis tournament will feature three matches tonight. At 7 PM, Wah Yee will play Reporters. At 8 PM, Commercial will play Chinese Staff. At 9 PM, Customs will play Southern Women's. All matches will be held at the Yuet Wah Table Tennis Room.</p>
<h3>Learning Swimming Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Poon Chung-siu</p>
<p>The weather in the southern country in April has begun to tempt people to go to the cool world. In order to learn a life-saving skill, in order to improve health, and even to pursue the joy of water, they are all willing to step into the water to spend the summer days. However, how to satisfactorily achieve what is imagined deserves attention. Talking about it on paper without actual practice in the water will definitely not succeed. If one engages in water sports without getting the right method, the effect will not be seen, and the harm will come first. This is not intentionally alarmist. "Those who are good at swimming drown" is a common occurrence. It is essential for beginners to have the swimming knowledge they should have. It is a pity that many daring people act rashly and cause harm to themselves.</p>
<p>There are many ways to swim. They can be divided according to their different actions: (1) Crawl, also known as freestyle, because the movements of this swimming style are very agile and fast. (2) Back Stroke, also known as supine swimming. (3) BreastStroke, also called prone swimming or frog style, because its swimming posture is very similar to the frog's swimming movements. The butterfly style, which is slightly different from the frog style, has become popular in recent years. Sidestroke, underwater swimming and others, but beginners should proceed step by step, starting with what is easy. There is also water entry training, which is an item to further study the success of swimming. It greatly helps to increase interest in swimming and to apply swimming skills.</p>
<p>Be brave and careful. This is the supreme safety guarantee for swimmers. Otherwise, it is too dangerous. First, let's talk about courage. The reasons why beginners do not perform well can be generally divided into three: (a) Intermittent and insufficient practice time. (b) Poor practice methods. (c) Too little courage. As for how beginners can get rid of their fear of water, they must make the greatest determination to solve the problem. Those who are proficient in swimming and want to improve need even more help with courage, especially in water entry practice. If they are timid, they simply have no way to start.</p>
<p>Many people who are preparing to complete their swimming training want to know how to be considered proficient. Regarding this question, I would like to explain it here. First, you must have confidence in floating. Second, the movements must be able to propel the body forward. Third, breathing must be smooth. Being able to meet the above conditions means that even if the swimming skills are still very immature, the foundation for further study has been laid. The importance of swimming breathing is not only often overlooked by beginners, but also many people who are already proficient do not know how to seek improvement in this regard. This is because breathing is a prerequisite for swimming movements to be sustained.</p>
<p>Regarding swimming in the water, what should be paid attention to before entering the water, and after coming out of the water, I will briefly provide some general suggestions. Among them, many are bad habits that are easily committed, even by those who like to do water sports. The impact is not only detrimental to health.</p>
<p>(A) Before entering the water—It is better to start with swimming suits. There are many types of swimming suits, especially those worn by women, with various patterns. When choosing them, it is better to choose those made of thread, which are cheap, durable, and very lightweight. Although those made of wool are easy to drain water and have the benefit of keeping the body warm, the added burden of the amount of water they hold is very inconvenient. Therefore, when choosing a swimming suit, you should pay attention to whether it is lightweight and fits the body. Otherwise, it will easily hinder swimming movements. Second, wearing a swimming cap. The reason why swimmers wear swimming caps is not to protect their heads, nor to participate in water polo competitions to facilitate identification. The obvious purpose is to wrap the hair. If you are accustomed to wearing a swimming cap and suddenly take it off, you will immediately feel the pain of water and hair covering your eyes. It is better not to wear a swimming cap.</p>
<p>Next, if you really go into the water, you must first sprinkle water on your limbs to prevent the skin from being suddenly stimulated by a temperature lower than your body temperature. This is one of the causes of so-called cramps. Many swimmers who have just eaten too much or walked a long distance and whose body temperature has increased sharply should also not go into the water immediately. Also, if you are swimming in a place without facilities, you must check whether the water quality is too dirty, whether the water flow is too rapid, and whether there are floating objects before entering the water. However, beginners should always practice in swimming pools.</p>
<p>(B) In the water—Many people feel headaches while swimming. If there is no other reason, it is because of the stimulation of the sun. If you wet your hair with water, it will be fine. But to swim without wetting your hair is obviously afraid of water, or at least afraid of water splashing into your facial features. The more you try to avoid it, the more you make your movements clumsy. Therefore, it is also a bad habit to frequently wipe your face and eyes with your hands. Spitting casually in swimming pools that use tap water is harmful to public health and is immoral. Although the mouth feels uncomfortable from being hit by water, you must endure it. Otherwise, you will waste too much precious saliva, which will not only affect your digestive ability, but also make you more susceptible to germs. This is because the water quality is never completely pure, and the gastric juice weakens the ability to kill bacteria. Beginners, those who have not swum for a long time, and those who are weak should not stay in the water for too long and should often go ashore to rest. If your limbs are cold and stiff, or you feel tired, you should still come out of the water to rest. No matter how skilled a diver is, it is very dangerous to rush to the center in front of the diving platform. I will add more points to pay attention to. Do not urinate in the water for convenience. This can cause problems in the lower body.</p>
<p>(C) After coming out of the water—Take a bath and change clothes. If you are hungry and want to eat, please do not drink too much soda. First wash your hands and rinse your mouth. This is not a troublesome thing. If water gets into your ears, you should try to get it out. This is very simple. Jump frequently on your toes and tilt your head, and the water will come out. If the water quality is too poor, it is also very important to disinfect your eyes after swimming.</p>
<p>How to practice swimming? Freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, underwater swimming, and even entering the water will be discussed next time.</p>

<h3>The Soul Lingers Around the Jiangmen Trees</h3>
<p>— Kin Bun</p>
<p>A few days after the Mukden Incident, I quietly went alone to Jiao Tou, this beautiful and tranquil little village on the opposite bank of Jiangmen. There were rice fields connected by paths, low hills, streams, woods, and a normal school where I lived. At that time, the patriotic fervor was spreading throughout the hearts of every student, stirring and setting off a climax of anti-Japanese sentiment. We spread out to every corner of Xinhui County, running around and shouting, waving flags and shouting, spreading the seeds of resistance to all directions. As the government yielded and retreated, we were forced to abandon our beloved work and return to the classroom, studying unfamiliar pedagogy. The dull atmosphere gnawed at our hearts. It was during that time that I met several heroic young partners. We intertwined our lives, several people with one heart, trying to continue our unfinished aspirations. We constantly read books on national salvation, practiced climbing and running in the morning, and even fasted once a week, intending to strengthen ourselves through these trainings. At that time, the distance we ran became longer and longer every day, one kilometer, two thousand three thousand... We ran all over Jiao Tou, crossed the river to Jiangmen, followed the highway to Huajiao, and Xinhui did long-distance running. Although running in the cold wind was a difficult task, it was spiritually very gratifying. Every day after running, we climbed the low hills, looked at the highway in the distance, lowered our heads and pondered the Jiang River at our feet, dreaming that in the near future, a volunteer army would suddenly appear before us like a miracle. We immediately joined the ranks and embarked on the road to national salvation, how exciting! We waited for this news day after day, but it never came. The January 28th Incident passed, and the Shanghai Truce was established. Our immature minds, along with the dull situation, became colder and colder day by day. Finally, we waited until the summer vacation, when we were assigned to practice at the central elementary school. When all our enthusiastic hopes had become empty dreams, Jiao Tou, Jiangmen, Beijie, Xinhui City, the highways we had hastily walked on, still lay quietly, occasionally only raising a cloud of dust caused by cars, arousing a sigh from us.</p>
<p>After graduation, we dispersed. Some went north to join the 29th Army, some were assigned to work in township offices, and some continued to teach. I myself ran far away to Shanghai to study, living a decadent university life.</p>
<p>Today, the battle for Jiangmen has finally erupted. The small hills where we stood and pondered, the highways we ran and sweated on, the rivers we swam in against the cold wind, the haystacks where we lay and read books on national salvation... have all become battlefields, every inch of land stained with blood. Jiao Tou, Jiangmen, Beijie, Xinhui City, the familiar areas where we trained, every road has become a trench, every house has become a fortress. The fantasy we eagerly prayed for eight years ago has finally come true, the only difference is that the battlefield has moved from north to south, and the flames of war have spread throughout Guangdong. The only difference is that the heroic fighters are no longer limited to a few young boys who climb and run, but have turned into the vast laboring masses.</p>
<h3>On Writing Biographies of National Heroes</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>It is now widely believed that writing biographies of national heroes is very necessary, because on the one hand, it can promote the noble character displayed by our ancestors, and on the other hand, it can inspire our descendants today to have a due understanding of the nation. This kind of writing, of course, is aimed at the general public, so the writing should first use words that the general public can understand, and cannot simply copy some things from ancient history; second, it must be based on reliable materials, and the materials cannot be distorted, such as adding unnecessary mythical stories like in romance novels; third, brief annotations must be added, such as place names and official titles, so as not to create a sense of estrangement for the readers. Recently, because I have been collecting some materials in this area, unfortunately, I feel that there are some inadequacies, so I dare to express my humble opinions and discuss them with fellow writers.</p>
<p>First, what I mean by using words that the general public can understand is no longer a problem in the already published biographies of national heroes. Only the Commercial Press's "Juvenile Series" is still written in classical Chinese, which is because the publication date was still in the early years of the Republic of China, so it is not surprising. However, in the two books "Wen Tianxiang" and "Shi Kefa" (published by New Life) written by Yi Junzuo, the dialogue parts still quote the original text without translation, which is really inappropriate. For example, in "Wen Tianxiang," the examiner Wang Yinglin said to the emperor after reading Wen Tianxiang's examination paper: "This paper's ancient righteousness is like a tortoise shell mirror, and its loyal heart is like iron." "Loyal heart like iron" may still be understandable, but how can the public understand "ancient righteousness like a tortoise shell mirror"? However, translating classical Chinese into vernacular is indeed very difficult sometimes, so I think that in this kind of place, we only need to write the general meaning, and do not necessarily have to translate it literally. At the same time, when writing in vernacular, we should not be too literary. For example, Wu Shutian's "Yue Fei" (published by Children) starts with writing about the sun and black crows, which is quite poetic, but this is not of interest to the general public. Moreover, the story itself is magnificent, so I think it is better to get straight to the point and start with the excitement. This kind of poetic environment cannot arouse the reader's emotions. It is just like a war drama, but the opening scene is a beautiful garden setting, which always feels a bit out of place!</p>
<p>Second, what I mean by basing the writing on reliable materials is not a problem in itself, but the problem is that some of the reliable materials still have misunderstandings. For example, in Zhang Yiping's "Wen Tianxiang" (published by Children), in the section "Escaping from Jingkou," it says, "Tianxiang followed the Yuan army all the way, and the boat passed Qiantang. Seeing the picturesque scenery of the West Lake, he could not help but feel sad and his tears fell like rain. Later, he passed Wumen and arrived at Jingkou." According to the history, Tianxiang was in Lin'an (now Hangzhou), in the Yuan camp at Beigaoting Mountain, and was forced to go north by Boyan. This journey was actually north along the Grand Canal, so he passed Wumen (now Suzhou) and arrived at Jingkou (now Zhenjiang). Since he set off north from Lin'an, how could Tianxiang see the "picturesque scenery of the West Lake" again? There is no such statement in the History of the Song Dynasty, but it was mistakenly pulled in by Zhang Jun. Also, the same section says, "The person who supervised Tianxiang was named Wang Qianhu." Qianhu is an official title, not a name. This is also a misunderstanding, which is very different from the original meaning. Yi Junzuo's "Wen Tianxiang" also has similar mistakes. For example, it says, "In the first year of Jingding, the imperial court appointed him as the Jiedushi of the Zhennan Army." According to the biography of Liu Yueshen and Wen Chengxiang, it originally said, "He was appointed as the Pan Guan Ying Gongshi of the Ninghai Army Jiedushi. Tianxiang wrote a letter requesting the beheading of Dong Songchen, but was not approved, so he resigned and returned. He served at Zhennan Army with his previous position." Zhennan Army was also a Pan Guan Ying Gongshi of the Jiedushi, not a Jiedushi. Moreover, this was not a conferment, but simply a removal from office, so it cannot be called a "conferment." Furthermore, in Wu Shutian's "Yue Fei," in his "Battle of Dongting Lake," he mistakenly wrote "Zhang Jun as Zhang Jun," which can be said to be extremely negligent. He does not know that Jun and Jun were originally two people, how can they be confused? At the time, Zhang Jun was the Dudu of Zhuzi Army, and Yue Fei was only a general. To use today's situation as an analogy, one is the commander-in-chief and the other is the division commander. The division commander naturally has a distinction of superior and inferior to the commander-in-chief. But when Wu Jun wrote about Yue Fei speaking to Zhang Jun, it was: "There is no need, you only need to keep the troops for eight days, and I guarantee that I will pacify Dongting Lake." According to the History of the Song Dynasty, Biography of Fei, it said: "There is already a plan. If the Dudu can stay for a while, the bandits can be defeated in less than eight days." It is clear that he addressed him as Dudu and did not use "Ru" (you), but she changed it to a "you," which is like a commanding tone, which is really not the tone of speaking to a superior.</p>
<p>Third, what I mean by adding simple annotations is because the names of things are different from ancient times to today, and without annotations, it is difficult for the public to understand. For example, in the section where Yue Fei attacked Li Cheng, Li Cheng sent generals to invade "Hongzhou." This Hongzhou does not exist on the current map. If we add an annotation "that is, Nanchang, Jiangxi today," wouldn't it make it easier for readers to understand? Also, as mentioned above, Wen Tianxiang was "Pan Guan Ying Gongshi of the Ninghai Army Jiedushi." There is no such official title today. We may as well briefly say that this is an official in charge of writing and accounting. Unfortunately, most of the books we have seen do not pay attention to these things, especially the official titles, which are not annotated.</p>
<p>The above is only my humble opinion. The books listed are just examples. If there is anything offensive, please forgive the original author and the readers!</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>In the high and remote open space of clouds and snow, faint traces of the moon appear; under the moon, thin clouds still float, falling like snow, and the faint moonlight that penetrates from the gaps in the clouds and snow seems to be guiding him and her out of the dark wall they have been lingering by for a long time.</p>
<p>However, she still said to him:</p>
<p>"You must promise me a condition to guarantee my safety."</p>
<p>"I can absolutely promise you!"</p>
<p>So, she started walking with him. After a few steps, she stopped again and said to him urgently:</p>
<p>"You have to tell me, when will you let me go back?"</p>
<p>"Whenever your family sends the money, that's when I'll let you go back."</p>
<p>"My dad loves money. What if he never sends the money?"</p>
<p>"Then I will definitely let you go back!"</p>
<p>"How long?"</p>
<p>He carefully considered it and said:</p>
<p>"Within two months."</p>
<p>"No, two months is too long! One month at most. Do you promise me?"</p>
<p>"I promise you!"</p>
<p>Then, she continued to walk the unfinished snowy road with him. Now, he and she have become two freely united travelers. Soon, they turned from the darkness to a brighter road; the lights of the shops along the road tempted her and him to look at each other from time to time. Whenever their eyes met, they immediately avoided each other and casually shifted their gaze to a certain point; after a while, they would secretly shift their gaze back to each other, as if to ask:</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" (38)</p>
<h3>Outside the Desolate Suburbs</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Facing a gust of desolate cold air, rushing down the hillside, it is already the season of early spring, why is the wilderness still stiff and frozen, without a hint of green? Gloomy, desolate, a gust of wind blows through the grass on the graves, and it even makes a terrifying sharp sound.</p>
<p>Stopping, gazing at the desolate tombs: those messy residual grasses, withered thorns, intertwined into a yellow carpet, spread out; the tombstones are lying there, desolate and silent, no one commemorates them, and no poets come to chant.</p>
<p>"Let's do it here! Use the desolate tombs as fortresses, and the coffins as gun racks, so we can face the highway in front."</p>
<p>The old man who said this immediately waved his mud shovel and easily dug a hole with a diameter of one foot, as if digging a steamed bun. He squeezed his body in, waited quietly, and glared out of a small hole with the machine gun handle! After we flattened the dug-up mud and residual grass, we also quickly passed through the jungle.</p>
<p>This area was considered to have been "swept clean", and the smell of gunpowder in the air seemed to have disappeared. The ××s were so complacent, wriggling on the winding highway like a long snake, their scattered black shadows like wild dogs looking for food, making the old man lying in the desolate tombs burn with anger, but he had to endure and hold his breath, letting time pass quietly. From dawn to noon, and then to dusk, he hid like a pair of silkworms lying in cocoons, remembering the captain's instructions: - The devils think this area has been "swept clean", so wait until their vigilance is relaxed, estimate that it can meet our amount of annihilation, and then do it!</p>
<p>The scattered devil shadows aroused his anger, and he suppressed it countless times by reviewing the instructions, and continued to wait, watch, estimate, and wait for dozens of hours.</p>
<p>Time was approaching dusk of the second day.</p>
<p>In the silent twilight, a burst of noise came from the highway. Three ××s with handlebar mustaches and gold-rimmed glasses came riding on tall horses, their command knives flashing with brilliant silver light, complacent and arrogant, followed by a large group. The motorcycles bumped on the highway, looking very heavy, probably loaded with ammunition?</p>
<p>At this time, the old man estimated and laughed: the fire of anger burned up, violently and swiftly, through his whole body: he held the machine gun - ge ge ge... - and fiercely swept a burst.</p>
<p>The people with handlebar mustaches and gold-rimmed glasses immediately fell off their horses and quickly fell down, their dirty blood splattering all over the ground. The ××s who were not killed behind were all stunned and frantically fired around, and a fire net crisscrossed in the sky, covering the empty wilderness.</p>
<p>The ××s were probably wondering, right? Is this human world, or a dream? Looking around, there were only silent jungles and desolate tombs in the wilderness, and no one else.</p>
<p>When they ran to encircle the jungle, the old man laughed so hard that his stomach hurt, and he lay down to eat dry food.</p>
<p>After a burst of running, the old man fired another burst, and under the fire net, who knows how many ××s fell.</p>
<p>The night gradually deepened, and the ××s who had missed the attack were still frightened and anxious; angry, they relied on their sophisticated equipment to exert its destructive power: - boom... tong... dong... the mountain guns shook the entire wilderness, and the flames spread on the dry weeds; the old man's hot blood also boiled, but he more calmly caressed the machine gun handle: ge ge ge ge ge... then laughed loudly again.</p>
<h3>The Last Poem of Spring</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shuipai</p>
<p>'Spring, sweet spring, the merry monarch of the year;</p>
<p>Then each thing puts forth; al that tread,</p>
