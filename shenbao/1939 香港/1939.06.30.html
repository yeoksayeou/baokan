<p>社評</p>
<h3>關於英日東京談判問題</h3>
<p>天津租界問題，將由英日雙方在東京進行談判以謀解決了。我們已在前天小評中指出：日×最近一面向外蒙挑釁，一面強佔汕頭定海，宣佈封鎖福州溫州，同時具有向英國誘騙與嚇許的作用。昨日本港突然傳出「廣州×軍全部撤退」的消息，雖然事實上日×為軍事意義，容有撤調一部份駐粵軍隊的可能，但是亦可看做日×配合汪逆等正在進行中的大陰謀在對英談判前排演的某種姿態！</p>
<p>據廿七日路透社南京電，日方在對英談判提出兩項要求，第一項，天津租界不應為華人作反日活動之用，第二項，天津租界不能作為支持中國國幣以對抗日本新幣之根據地。該社傳稱：『英政府不能同意第二項建議』。英政府方面的態度，從張伯倫最近的演詞看來，已擬接受日方要求，。儘管全英國人民反對妥協外交的聲浪業以汹湧澎湃，然而張伯倫政府則還堅持『和平未至絕望時期决不放棄和平』的原則。因此，就目前形勢而論，英日東京談判之不會獲得解决問題的根本辦法，是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>不過，事實上不管日×怎樣對英誘騙與嚇詐，也不管英國對日會不會繼續妥協屈服，有一件事是不會變化的，這就是日×勢力的發展，就必然日益增進。它和英國的矛盾衝突，或除英國自願退出遠東，英日縱使妥協，亦不會有多少時日的。何况，儘管日×採取一切欺騙的方式，事實上日×早已對英實行『不宣之戰』了！</p>
<p>同時，就最近幾年來在遠東發生的一切事件觀察，英國的利害，已和我國的利害完全一致；在日本××的瘋狂進攻，劫掠，與殺戮之下我們喪失了東北四省，英國亦卽喪失其原在東北四省所享的一切權益，我們的軍隊和政權從華北華中華東以至華南退出，英國亦即喪失其原在華北華中華東以至華南的一切權利和僑民遭遇日×的破壞，劫奪，侮辱和殺戮。相反的，我國全民族的抗戰，爲了保衛我國的領土主權，同時亦爲英國在華權益以有力的保障。因此我國抗戰如果中途妥協或失敗，實際上也就是英國的失敗與損失，我國的抗戰如果能够堅持，則必能獲得最後的勝利，而我國的勝利，亦卽是英國的勝利。</p>
<p>這個理由，每個中國人應該知道，亦爲每個有遠見的英國人士以至英國政府所早已洞鑒的。因此，不管英政府目前對日會不會是妥協，我們都可以斷言：中國不是捷克！英國不會亦不能把中國當捷克！</p>
<p>無論東京談判將怎樣進行，我們不僅絕不容許英國政府漢視我國的利益，不僅絕不容許這次談判對我抗戰的利益加以任何以損害，並！同時，我們還要向國人提醒：我們英勇堅持抗戰兩年的結果，己經取對遠東問題與任何有關我國的的國際問題的發言權，而旦有權督促各國尊重我們這個權利。不過我們還要向國際向友邦表現更偉大的力量，要表現我們自已的力量亦足以戰勝日×漢奸，表現中華民族决不受日×漢奸的統治，那麼，我們每一個不願做奴隸中國人，都得嚴肅緊張起來才是！尤其天天接近友邦人士的同胞，更要提高我們的自尊心和自信心啊！</p>

<h3>平地游擊戰爭論</h3>
<p>— 周士梯</p>
<p>（一）平地游擊戰爭的重要性</p>
<p>一、廿四個月的抗戰的經騐證明了在×人後方側方廣大地區發展游擊戰爭、建立游擊根據地、已達到它的任務、</p>
<p>甲、發動並組織了千百萬羣衆與×鬥爭、摧毀了僞政權、保持×軍佔領區域內大部領土在中國人手裏、</p>
<p>乙、消耗了×人不少人力物力財力和箝制及分散了×人不少兵力、</p>
<p>丙、動搖了×人的軍心、並組織了不斷的僞軍反正、</p>
<p>丁、在戰略戰役戰鬥上、配合正規軍、起了很大作用。</p>
<p>二、目前的戰爭形勢、是處於從第一階段、（×人戰進攻、我軍戰略防禦）過渡到第二階段（×我戰略相持）的時期、堅持與發展×人側方後方各地區的游擊戰爭、鞏固原有的及建立新的戰略支點、配合各方面作戰、以達到更大更多的消耗×人、箝制、分散×人、迅速結束第一階段、而渡過到第二階段、使在第三階段時更有保障和順利地進行戰略反攻、具有很重要的意義的、尤其是在今天的華北、更爲重要迫切的任務、</p>
<p>而華北地區、平地比華中華南更多、因此在華北就應該有決心在平地發展游擊戰爭、</p>
<p>如果說平地不能進行游擊戰爭、不能建立游擊根據地、則等於自動放棄華北約三分之一以上（我從地圖上大約計算的數字）的領土、任日×統治、讓千百萬同胞給日×摧殘、屠殺、讓無限的富源任×人掠取、這不僅是對於游擊戰爭的實質和重要性的不了解、而且也是對於抗日戰爭發展缺乏信心、因此對於平地游擊戰爭、應從整憫抗日戰爭中、從政治上從軍事上和經濟上去認識其重要性、</p>
<p>（二）平地能發展游擊戰爭，建立游擊根據地嗎？</p>
<p>一、山地地形條件以平地地形條件好、游擊戰爭容易發展、游擊根據地容易建立與鞏固、這是事實、可是、建立游擊根據地、發展游擊戰爭的主要條件、是羣衆條件、羣衆與游擊隊正如魚之與水、魚有了水、可以馳騁自如、游擊隊有了羣衆、可以抗擊×人與保衛自己、不論河北、山東、河南、山西、綏遠、察哈爾、熱河等地、平地的人口村莊、總比山地稠密得多、有了群衆條件、（當然要去發展組織領導）、就存在着能够發展游擊戰爭、建立游擊根據地的基本條件、</p>
<p>二、平地能增加空軍、裝甲部隊、（包括坦克車、裝軍汽車、裝申火車）、騎兵、砲兵的效力、×人技術比我優越、這是在平地中不利的條件、可是平地也有很多的村莊、大溝、小溝、土堆、隙地、河流、樹林、植物等的地形地物、以及夜間、雨、露、風、雪等的天時、都可以使部隊客易隱蔽、都可以使×人的技術兵種的活動受到部份的限制、同時、×愈深入、則戰綫愈延長、×人兵力愈不够分配、尤其是×人的技術兵種是有限的、而且大部份經久使用於主要戰場、在後方側方游擊地區分配的比例很少、）不是說×人不會集中兵力和技術、來進攻游擊根據地、而是說一般的是少數、同時、汽車、裝甲汽車、都要有汽車路或較好的火車路、才能行駛、坦克車必依靠火軍遝輸到離作戰地區百數十里才使用、坦克車爲防反坦克車砲、在村莊周密地區使用、顧慮甚大、兼以車中熱氣很重、行駛時左傾右斜、駕駛員精神上很不舒服、一個駕駛員工作一天卽須休息、如裝中火車只能在鐵路上行駛、裝甲部隊、幷不無條件的使用、它亦有很多的困難、同時、我們亦有防衛抗擊的方法與經騐、所以在平地不要過分的害怕×人技術兵種、只要有群衆條件、有了高度的抗日情緒和心理、有了吃苦耐勞的精神、就能在平地中產生游擊戰爭、</p>
<p>三、在華北方面、廿四個月的抗戰、事實己證明了平地可以發展游擊戰爭、建立游擊根據地、山東的西北部、河南的東北部、河北全省、綏遠東部南部北部、山西的雁北壩子、汾河壩子等平地、不但小的游擊隊、而且大的游擊兵團和正規兵團、都能活動自如、並且　冀中、冀東、冀南、山東西北部的平原中、都建立了大塊游擊地、（雖然有無還不是鞏固的）例如我們的第□支隊第□支隊、在陽曲、淸源、文水、交城、祁縣、太谷、汾陽的平壩中活動、無數次的與×進行戰爭、取得不斷的勝利、摧毀了×人僞政權、發動組織了廣大羣衆、特別是我們□□支隊配合保安支隊與工人自衛隊各一部、十月間襲擊在汾河壩子中間的祁縣北關、獲得完滿的成功、他們襲擊時、從很遠地方帶去牛車五十輛、襲擊成功後、將日×的布廠的布運囘二千餘疋、（就地發給羣衆千餘疋尙在外）這是游擊隊在平地活動的創舉與奇覜、</p>
<p>四、我們肯定的說、平地也能發展游擊戰爭、建立游擊根據地、雖然比山地困難些、</p>
<p>（三）戰術上幾個問題</p>
<p>在平地、我們仍然要運用「主要的是游擊戰、但不放鬆有利條件下的運動戰」的原則、可是、平地與山地的地形條件不同、在平地進行較大規模運動戰的時機較少、但不是說在平地完全不能進行運動戰、而是說平地上游擊戰更爲主要罷了、現在將在平地活動的幾個戰術問題分述如下、</p>
<p>（甲）行軍　應注意的事項</p>
<p>子、爲若易于蔭蔽與防空、大部隊的行動、便於夜間行軍爲有利、（平地道路平坦寬大、便於夜閱行軍，）可是道路繁多和地形地物不易識別、故通訊聯絡須特別注意，</p>
<p>丑、平坦地道路寬大、應探取二　至四路縱隊、縮短行軍路距離、但在白天爲便於防空、各分隊間須留出相當距離、平地平行路多、如大兵團打動、可分二三個縱隊行進、</p>
<p>寅、白天行軍應特別注意防空、每個人員馬匹担架、必須確實僞裝、發現×機時、迅速離開道路、利用附近的地形地物、雖小溝大堆、田坎、草木、都是很有價値的、不論有無地形地物利用、均取臥下姿勢、不應在村莊中密集蔭蔽、蔭蔽時以班爲單位分散、指揮者與分散各部隊應注意聯絡、此時對地上的×人、（特別是騎兵）的警戒、是要特別注意、對空射擊部隊、如×機未發現我們、和不在有效射擊距離內、不應射擊、</p>
<p>卯、平地交通便利、道路繁多、×人騎兵、裝甲部隊、汽車等的活動力大、與×距離甚遠、亦應有遇×之顧慮、因此偵察、警戒和戰鬥準備、隨時隨地都要注意的、平地平行道路很多、前衛、後衛、側衛的警戒部隊、必須根據原則、按照情况而派遣、途中休息時、亦須卽時派出警戒、疏忽和苟且是不允許的、此次□支隊第□連、在歸綏東南的平壩中、襲擊僞軍、繳獲五六十匹馬、因不注意偵察警戒、行至四通子、附近、被×伏擊、致繳獲馬匹及勝利品盡失、且傷失聯絡數人、這是嚴重的敎訓、</p>
<p>（乙）宿營時應注意事項</p>
<p>子、宿營地的區分、要合於戰術要求、冬春天雖然要全部合營、但房屋缺少時、可盡量擠攏、不可因房屋的關係、而影響到整個宿營的計劃、</p>
<p>丑、先派出警戒、然後才可進入宿營地、進宿營地後、各級幹部及通信員、要預先察看宿營及附近的地形路徑及緊急集合場、各級幹部須考慮到發現×人的處置、經常要有値班部隊、以應付臨時事變、並須調查周圍一百里以內的路線、繪成路綫圖。</p>
<p>寅、偵察警戒要嚴密、並且應是周圍的。除主力部隊派出偵察外、警戒部隊要派出偵察班或組、在警戒綫外十數里處、不斷偵察、警戒部隊、依照警戒原則、和當地情况、　備兵力兵器、一般的要比山地加强、距離可稍速些、並且一定要做工事和偽裝、觀察者可位置於樹上、屋頂上加以偽裝或在高粱地內、（用架梯子、觀察者坐於梯子上）</p>
<p>卯、防空、每個宿營地、都要設專門對空觀察哨、防空警報、對空射擊部隊、區分蔭蔽地域、蔭蔽地點不應在村莊內、可利用村莊外之小溝十堆、植物園地、樹林等、一切可能利甩的地形地物、并做單人的防空蔭蔽孔、或四五個人的防空蔭蔽溝、加以偽裝、如時間許注意對地上的×人、尤其是騎兵的襲擊、故此時除警戒部隊外、各部隊應有專門的地上的觀察員、</p>
<p>在平地上防空、最要注意的是烟火、平地的烟火、空軍很遠就能發見、是對空軍指示目標的最好標記、故在宿營地燒火的時間、應有計劃的規定、最好從八時至十六時不應燒火、早飯在八時以前煮好、晚飯在下午輪流來煮、以免同時發現很多煙火、如發現×空軍時、火煙均應撲滅、並規定在白天不準燒坑</p>
<p>辰、如着防空、以駐小村莊爲有利因大村莊和市鎭、目標更大</p>
<p>丙　作戰時應注意事項</p>
<p>子、平地交通便、×人增援出速、兼以火力效能增大、而×人火力即佔優勢、如果戰鬥時間延長、對我是不利的、故戰鬥時更要堅决勇敢迅速、在短時間內解决戰鬥爲有力、</p>
<p>丑、估計到×人火力的强盛、所以我們要善於集中和使用我們的武器、有計劃的組織火力、用突然的猛烈的火力、在短時間內取得火力的優勢、此時突擊隊應堅決迅速的施行突擊、在×火力未展開前、我已接近×人、進行肉搏、使×人武器雖優、亦無所施、在平地戰鬥、一方面要避免和減少×人武器的傷害、這是戰鬥約要訣、同時、超越射擊的時機很少、間隙射擊增多、這都是在平時教育上要注意的、</p>
<p>寅、平地便於坦克車、裝甲汽車、裝甲火車、騎兵等技術兵種和空軍的活動、不論在行軍宿營、都要注　對×技術之防禦與抗擊、並在平時要加强對×技術兵科的敎育、</p>
<p>卯、我方各級指揮者、在戰鬥時、常常是在部隊的前面、或第一梯隊、這是革命的責任心所使、但這樣往往容易遇到不應有的損害、特別在平地上、火力的猛烈、和不易掩蔽、故各級指揮者的位置與指揮所、應以便以指揮所屬分隊和觀察各方面的情況爲標準、不宣過於接近前方、同時要有偽裝、</p>
<p>辰、平地上村落較好、往往爲攻者防者的據點、成爲在戰術上很有價値的地物、根據抗戰以來的經驗、×人與我戰鬥時、多利用吋落爲據點、而我們武器缺乏、和戰術上有多少弱點、致×利用村落時、就不易克服、在平地上村落戰鬥時機更多、我們須把過去村　戰鬥的經騐敎訓和村落戰鬥的戰術原則、實際運用在部隊中增加村落戰鬥的演習、</p>

<h3>欣欣向榮的寶雞</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>漢高帝「明修棧道，暗渡陳倉」的典故，說起來大家總會覺得十分耳熟，而且有些興趣吧！這裏要談的寳鷄，就是陳倉所在地（與寳鷄城隔河相望），不過自抗戰而後，隴海通車至此，她却另以一種劃時代的嶄新姿態出現了。</p>
<p>寳鷄以前因交通不便，敎育落後，一般政治　設，均少成績可言。據現任縣長王奉瑞氏談：中國革命廿餘年，但力量尙未達到縣政府。所謂科房司爺，多係前淸衙門中人，從十餘至二十的人數。包辦科房工作，但月領薪項僅六十四元，卽將食宿辦公費統盤包括在內，個中弊實叢生，自可不問而知。莫說一切庶政建設談不上，甚至連縣府都被住吃得連「化子房」不如，可是歷任縣長及世襲科房司爺，均一貫安之若素。</p>
<p>可是現在的寳鷄，却大非昔比了。這位王縣長是研究工程學的，他原在實業部任事，因蔣委員長鑒於寳雞市政建設之重要，特意把他調來担任是職。行新政要用新人，他曾委任了十六個靑年大學生做助手。惟縣府經費有限，月薪每人十六元，而伙食卽須吃至十七元半，不敷者王縣長只好由目己稅收提成項下，撥來津貼他們。這十六個靑年志在做事，此外倒也滿不在乎。縣政一切收入開支，採用銀行薄記法，按日筆筆淸算，假若上峯要來查賬，或者有人參觀，隨時可將簿記取出，使對方一目了然，縣府如此財政公開，却是難能可貴。一般縣政中，　放纏足，男剪髮辮，此間尙待努力推行，上月份開始剪辮運動，僅在縣城罅鎮兩地，卽剪獲一萬七千餘條，於此可見一</p>
<p>戰時縣政，縣府會同第×預備師政治部主任岳峙及全部人員　極力推進</p>
<p>工業方面，自抗戰以後，各大都市的工廠，因受戰事影饗，相繼西遷寳雞者，如紡織，印刷，機械，電池，火柴，肥皂，織染等，大小約計二百家，其中以申新紗廠規模較大。各工業幷有合作社的組織，其數量已達四十三個單位，自戰區流徙至此的失業工人，曾爲之安挿了六七千人。各工廠重要機器，都採用戰時科學處理方法，疎敬四鄉，而深藏於窰洞中。假若我們把『鴻飛冥冥，弋人何慕』的古詩，改成『廠設幽幽，鐵烏將安下卵』之句，用以歌誦寶鷄地下工廠之安全，大概不至會失于誇大　！</p>
<p>普通防空洞之多，亦幾堪與蜂巢嫓美。敵機曾到此肆虐兩次，投彈五六十枚，很死傷數頭次僅爲二十人左右，第二次且減至七八人而已。</p>
<p>此間舊有一惡習，無論城鄉居民，多不講公共衛生，而可到處便溺。後經×師到此駐　，嚴令取締，每晨佈哨捉拿，日得數百數，人不等；有一早上，某師長且御駕親扯，單槍匹馬，速俘此輩『毒品私造私販犯』三十餘人，槪行發配挖掘防空洞，『經之營之，不日成之』。從此私販絕跡，而空防亦告完功了。</p>
<p>寶雞前無報紙，後經師部籌劃，始得鄭州通俗日報社同意，於四月間遷此出版，日出小型報一張，定價三月二元。由師部印發推行市民閱讀辦法，勸吿市民訂閱，目的希望達到每家一份，以期民　與文化事業得同收實效。</p>
<p>寳雞交通四達，已成西北與西南的聯絡中心。物產方面，除上述棉麥之外，尙有南山茂密的森林。數處豐美的煤礦。以及可供發電之用的大瀑布，均足適應目前工廠林立之需要，所以地價飛漲，如在交通路綫附近的耕地，以前每畝値價數十元者，現巳漲至一千餘元。假若該地今後不至遭遇特殊打擊，其工商企業之繁榮，文化事業之發達，前途誠未可限量。</p>
<p>民訓工作，以記合戰時的需要。中如壯丁，保長，甲長，茶役，妓女，商民，難童，戲劇負，技藝人員（說棗，相命各雜技）等等，均曾分別加以二月以上的訓練，大都已有較滿人意的成績表現了。</p>
<p>關于已訓民衆，對于募捐，宣傳，慰勞，防空，救護，偵察等項工作，都已實際做過，且做得相當的好。例如前線轉運來此的傷兵，經常約達××成數，不論舊有的新來的，民衆都在熱烈地慰勞他們。各戲院每週招待看戲一次，澡堂每週歡迎洗澡一次，理髮業每週輪流赴醫院理髮一次，各校學生，亦不斷赴院歌唱演劇，及代寫書信。婦女慰勞隊（以妓女成分最多，計有一六一人），亦每週赴院歌詠演劇，或分別談話一次。軍民互相友善的情感。由此一天天建立起來，直接固可鼓勵士氣，間接亦能增進社會秩序。妓女受訓時，曾　習看護特務兩科，寳鷄前兩次被炸，她們都能勇往直前，救護死傷。此外她們還破獲盜案數起，所以很博得一般人的好評。</p>
<p>縣城內的新建設，首推敷設濾水器及通水管，引用北山泉水，以供全城飲料。西北各縣之有自來水，殆以此爲矯矢。次爲縣府地下辦公室，現正就靠城某山腹開鑿中，設計之完美，似不僅備供縣府一時防空之用。另外還有個市區工程計劃，大約不久亦可見諸實行。</p>
<p>寶縣的農產物，米粮很少，每年約產四百石，棉麥產量較多，棉年產約六七十萬餘斤，麥約四萬八千五百餘石。商業不甚發達，市面貨物。其銷售量較大者，以米麥藥材花布爲大宗。</p>

<h3>世界和平的保障</h3>
<p>— 世長</p>
<p>自從英法和蘇聯開始談判以來，已四月有餘、但是最後的協定，終遲遲未能締結，問題的癥結，，顯然是對於波羅的海諸國的保證，其他的困難，是不成問題的，據最近的消息，英國已决定再度讓步，凖備接受蘇方的一切要求，所以，英蘇協定的成立，在最近的將來，必可實現了。</p>
<p>我們應該認淸，英蘇雙方的談判，是基於互惠平等的原則，並且，是為了大家的利益，如果，波羅的海各國一旦遭受侵略。那末，蘇聯的安全就有了嚴重的威脅，英國也定必感覺不安；而且，英法若不和蘇聯接近，舉行談判，成立協定，則納粹艦隊很可大膽的駛入波羅的海，進犯蘇聯，威脅英法，但是，英法蘇三國協定成立以後，實力堅强，足以對付任何侵略，使侵略者不致亳無顧忌的為所欲為，這實是世界和平的保障。</p>
<p>英法蘇三國，我們承認，都是愛好和平的國家，它們互相舉行談判的目的，除了確保本身安全外一，也是為了世界的和平上或者，更準確的說，歐洲的和平。所以，很顯然的，英法蘇協定的主要目的是在避免戰爭，英法决不會引起戰事，這是誰都承認的，戰爭的危險在德國了如果希特勒再說反對戰爭，那是有些確實的，因為，納粹黨希望推行不流血的征服制度，吞奧大利，併捷克斯拉夫，不都是很好嗎？</p>
<p>希特勒大聲狂呼，德國必須收囘舊有殖民地，而對波羅的海至黑海一帶，更是野心勃勃，但，如要達到這種目的，除了戰爭外，別無良策，所以，德國的一切行動，都以戰爭為依據；全國的經濟，更是基於備戰的狀態，生產事業的百分之八十，都是戰爭材料和軍用品，工資低落，人民購買力減少，粮食的進口都被戰爭材料的輸人所替代，一切的一切，都以戰爭為中心，捨麵包而取大砲，德國的情勢，巳到了萬分危險的地步了。</p>
<p>各國對于德國的情形都很熟悉，希特勒和戈林之流並不是不知道本國的危機，但是，他們尚存一線希望，那就是，等候良機，逞時一戰，捨此而外，實別無良策，以挽救國內的厄運了。</p>
<p>這是目前毆洲的危機狀態，德國急切要向外謀發展，而民主國家集團，對於行將爆發的侵略行為，必須加以制止，固然，未來的大勢，神秘莫測，任何人都不能準確的預料到，但是，推求獲得和平的方向，是不很困難的，英法蘇三角大同盟的重要，也就在此地，德國在發動侵略以前，就必須顧到英，法，蘇，美，波蘭和土耳其，這些國家將和德國處於敵對的地位；而且，意大利的冷淡態度，巴爾幹諸國的中立，都足予德以不利，但是，如果英法蘇未能　　協定，一切的情形就大大不同了，那時，納粹領袖們必定迅速的動員，突襲毗隣的小國，其後果是不堪設想的。</p>
<p>現在的國際局勢，是在緊張的場面下維持着，關心和平者，莫不憂形於色，但是，大局的操縱者，和戰的决定者，還是在倫敦和莫斯科，無疑的，英法蘇協定將是世界和平的保障。</p>

<h3>大學敎育</h3>
<p>大學值得進嗎？</p>
<p>要研究現代大學敎育的價值，哈佛大學的一九一一年級，是很好的資料。我們一班都是很普通的學生，沒有特別好的讀書成績，沒有名震全國的大運動家，也沒有出類拔萃的思想冢。大學生在美國祇代表全部人民的百分之五，我們都是少數的幸運兒，得以受到世界上的所謂高等敎育。現在我們不妨來研究研究，看我們怎樣利用這種高等敎育的機會吧。</p>
<p>在我們一級中，眞是人才濟濟：有前美國軍團總司令，有五年沒睡過床的流浪漢，有汽車添油站的老板，有前紐約證券交易所的所長，有機器師，有無線電播昔家，有國際聯盟會的高級長官，有大學校長，有鐵路郵務員，有出租午餐車者，有星星監獄的哈佛俱樂部會員。此外，還有的是，枚不勝舉。</p>
<p>在我們這班人中有百分之五十，承認我們目前的職業，不是當初大學畢業時所希望做的。我們有的已經換過五六種職業，現在還在找新的。從畢業時起到現在一直釘住一種職業的，祇有百分之五。</p>
<p>在我們一班中，我又發現了幾件可驚的事實。在從大學校裏畢業了二十五年的今日，有八分之一的同窗在受政府的救濟。或是靠家庭吃飯。有些同學連校長的名字都拚不出，在脫離大學生活二十五年的今日，我們全級平均收入是每年每人四千五百美金。在我們這些受過大學敎育，而且在社會中混了四分之一世紀的人看來，這數目當然不能算多</p>
<p>我把這五白四十一人詳細調查過以後，覺得大學敎育並不能担保生活安定。有些和富家女結婚的同學，把錢胡亂投資花盡了，有些同學讓他們的岳父去投資，也都失敗了，有許多同學釘住一種職業，結果受盡不景氣的打擊。在另外一方面，有一個在大學裏工讀的窮孩子，當初祇認得十幾位級友，現在是一串雪茄公司的大老板了。那個晚上在交易所裏接電話掙錢，日裏到學校裏來上課，不曉得在甚麼時候睡覺的小子，今日是美國幾個大科學家之一·那個在學校裏加人每個俱樂部，一天到晚跟人家握手的同學，最近繳付了兩千六百四十五元美金的所得稅。</p>
<p>那麼，所謂大學敎育的四年，對於我們有甚麼特殊的利益沒有呢？世界上有不少沒有進過大學的人，他們也幹出大事業，做過對於人類有裨益的事情。從我們級中的一部份人講來，大學敎育無疑地是有價值的。可是要賣股票，賣證券，做保險生意，賣地產，要做投資顧問，或是窒內裝飾匠，那是用不若受大學敎育的。</p>
<p>大學校素來被看做一盞智慧之燈。可是現在這盞智慧之燈却產生了這樣一批公民。假如你送兒子進大學去，是想要他和一些顯貴的子弟交游，或是希望他將來錢掙得多，那麼你還是再想想看，你是否在空耗他的時間和你的金錢。</p>
<p>最後，我又得聲明，這是說的美國，中國是不是如此，不得而知。</p>

<p>國學大師韓昌黎，最惧僧道妄言，認為是：亡國之妖孽也。他的家門口，總是貼着「僧道無緣」，從來不拔一毛。</p>

<p>一次，他們找到了一個把柄，便去見韓老夫子，問　：</p>
<p>『你旣然如此輕視佾道，為什麼你的小公子的小名却叫「僧哥」呢？』</p>
<p>『那太簡單了，』老韓一本正經地說，你們不聽見，打更的王老二，把兒子叫「阿狗」，買菜的李三　兒子叫「阿貓」嗎？我的兒子叫「倫哥」，也就是這個意思。」</p>

<h3>海上風雲</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述一九一四</p>
<p>年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，趁德輪『凱柏隆齊號』去游歷歐洲。在船上接着消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來。不久，又遇到冰山，和英艦的炮擊。好容易地逃出虎口，囘到美境白海。傑克比與爾便囘紐約去，見到邱克斯先生。邱又叫他們去歐洲找他的兒子……</p>
<p>「兌成現金帶去，」他將支票交出來，「若這些用完了，倫敦的李屋和哈定都是我的代理人，你要什麼去找他們。還有，這一次，你要帶什麼人同路嗎？」</p>
<p>「先生，我也預備說，這樣的苦差，比爾南諾——」</p>
<p>「他，我知道的，那個瘦長的孩子。很不錯的，但是他願意跟你去嗎？」</p>
<p>「我想地會願意的。」</p>
<p>九　再記一次賬</p>
<p>這樣一次差事，正如傑克自己也說過的，成功，簡直近乎不可能。但是，傑克究竟孩子氣十足，他倒挺高興趁此去觀光一下戰時的歐洲。至於比爾南諾，他對於受刺激，頗有點成癖的樣子。</p>
<p>『聖瑪克號』是一條很有名的船，往常她開航出去，常常艙位都賣滿。但是，這次，頭等艙乘客寥寥無幾，二等艙乘客疏若晨星，末等艙呢，數來不到一百個人，大半都是到歐洲囘本國去入伍的。</p>
<p>當他們航出海口的時候，兩岸滿列着都是大小的船隻，從小貨馱，到四個烟卣的大輪船，都下了的　　　　　　　　　　　　　　在那兒。在戰事以前，他們往來於託金斯維，斯　泰，弗羅里達，經商事業，到現在，似乎一切都癱痪了，呆滯不動了。美國是守中立法的，她的責任，檢查出口的船隻，防止　他們攜帶戰時違禁品，尤其對於掛着參戰國國旗的更加注意。</p>
<p>經過一偭靑年低級車官，查問了一番之後，「聖瑪克號」降下旗幟，駛出海口。</p>
<p>『好啦，傑克，』比爾南諾說，這時，傑克剛替船上發完幾封道別和商業上的信件，「我們又上路啦。」</p>
<p>「眞是，并且這一次，謝天謝地，我們是在美國旗下面了，在這年頭兒，眞算好運氣。」</p>
<p>「這到是的，可是你可有一點影兒，知道這船會靠那一個口岸？」</p>
<p>『現在還不知道，我們要等紐約或者倫教公司的電報來，才决定呢。』</p>
<p>『我們現在所任的，眞是一椿新奇的職位傑克，』</p>
<p>『可不是嗎？我希望能進行得說順利，無論如何，對於我們，却是一個機會去看看戰爭時的情形。</p>
<p>『這到是個極好的機緣，至於很尋找湯姆邱克斯，那等於海底撈針，真非容易呢。』</p>
<p>一個身軀重大的男子，黑　鬚，走進無線電室，他手裏拿著一封己經寫好了的信件。</p>

<h3>水球的傳遞及投射　講座</h3>
<p>— 潘叢紹</p>
<p>為着使球　得遠、遠力大、或拋高球、臂力運用、必須强勁、而上體浮出水面愈高、揮手拋球與腰力的發出、也就愈大、一隻手持球拋擲、另一隻手要在水中向身旁側伸、以助臂力的運用、同時還有向下微壓、使體更浮之功、要注意這要在水中的手所能發出浮體助力的動作、</p>
<p>浮體固為擲球者所要勤習、以便靈活運用、水球傳遞、接球者也要具有高浮水中的泳技、至其對于搶球之重要、更不必說了、</p>
<p>具有捷泳的本領、曉得持球擲球、傳遞水球、已有可能、也能作整隊水球運動的練習了、至投射球門、擇其要訣的一二、以供習者參考、</p>
<p>從水球戰略上來說、如何佈陣前進、扣關之術貴能奇速、而日常練習射門、就要注重投射的基本技術、水球門並不　濶、守門者如具跳躍水中的長才、投球入鬥、實非易者、故扣關者必須、</p>
<p>第一、投射的力量猛烈、動作迅速、由于力猛、因賽場面積不廣、往往迫近球門、始作投射、頗使守門者見而生畏、而動作迅速、卽令門將鎭靜、時因迅雷不及掩耳、而致搶救莫及、</p>
<p>第二、投射方向、務求勿顯、因為迫近球門投射、投射方向、易被觀測、故在放球時的手勢看來殊像仍在準備投射動作中、根本不使守門者獲其觀測、以資應付的機會、</p>
<p>凡此兩端、均為門將所忌怕的、施我之長、以彼不能克服的缺陷、如此基本動的作學取、價值至大、（完）</p>

<h3>太極拳式的外交</h3>
<p>— 千里</p>
<p>和平，和平，大事化眞小事，小事化爲烏有，這是「和平天使」張伯偷先生執政以來所持的政策。可是有時被那些不講道理只是蠻幹的蠻子，迫得沒有辦法的時候，張「和平天使」也只好暫時把和平口號放下，而大講其實力來。他說：「你看我們英國的海軍是最强的，我們英國的空軍是世上第一，我們的唐克和大砲的威力，也是誰都比不上的哩，我們不害怕誰，我們也「不怕打戰」，如果你們若一味不自量力蠻下去，那麼，你們要生後悔的……」</p>
<p>有時，這些話也發生了點効力，於是張老先生就順勢力推舟，將那些糾紛的事件，遷就結束。但有時，遇薯更蠻强的蠻子，他們看淸這位手拿和平雨傘的張老先生，究竟不是戰神，雨傘也不能代替槍劍，所以他們置之不理，而繼續蠻幹下去。這時候，張伯倫先生的處境確有點爲難，可是他也有法子，就是連絡各方面，叫大家忍受，退讓，犧牲，勿使事件擴大，守住「和平」。</p>
<p>就用這種辦法，遂產生了對西的「不于涉政策」，對捷的『明興會議』，而保住了世界的『和平』！</p>
<p>我們的吳老先生看見張伯倫先生所玩的這種外交政策，的是工夫老到，變化無窮，所以稱張先生的政策，好比是「打太極拳」，說他『硬中帶軟，中帶硬，以柔制剛，使對方無法施展的妙策。』他叫人家莫要小看這位老頭子。</p>
<p>就我所知，大概不會有人敢看輕這位工夫老到所施的外交妙策的。可惜的，是那些蠻幹的蠻子并不理解張老先生的「太極拳玫策」的利害，而仍是蠻幹下去。所以結果西班牙被犧牲了，捷克也被犧牲了，而奧大利，阿爾巴尼亞先後同遭犧牲，此外如波蘭，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞……也危危急急在等著犧性。</p>
<p>在遠東方面哩，中國本身被犧牲了一大半，而列强在華的利益被犧牲的也許更在大半以上，滿州的市場被日本小蠻子完全霸佔了，華北和華中的外人市場也被排除得幾乎凈盡，現在僅存的幾個相界也在風雨飄搖之中，鼓浪嶼的警權的橫被蹂躪及受封鎖，上海的工部局的屢被子涉及脅迫，英艦英輸的迭被轟炸，英國外交官員的不時受書及架綁，這一切都是張伯倫先生「和平外交」對付强權者所結的佳果。</p>
<p>如今在這天津事件里頭，對方蠻幹的蠻法似更爲透骨化了。日本小鬼不但把堂堂的大英帝團臣民，通通封鎖在通薯電流的租界內，斷絕蔬菜和肉類的輸進。幷且還要玩著種種的把戲，例如强迫英僑在光天化日之下當衆赤身裸體，挑剔搜查，甚至於下體和頭髮都不能免，而且更進一步對於英僑段特生女士，亦喝令其當衆脫開褲子來了，這種極端的待遇，就是被征服的國土恐也未必常有的吧。然而張倫伯先生似平幷不在乎的樣子，他老人家除堅决表示「尚未達到報復的嚴重階段」之外，就是派遺駐日大使克萊琪去拜訪日外相有田，請其大發慈悲，中止日方行爲的一法，這大概也就是太極拳外交政策以柔制剛的辦法了。</p>
<p>不過，這種太極拳式的外交，是否能獲到効果，使日方終見天良而發慈悲，結果被柔所克服？抑反而只有「等於鼓勵日方繼暴行」？從事實上的證明，似乎是屬於後者。我們不看見，鼓浪嶼登陸的日兵因爲英美法三國的同樣的動作而撤退了嗎？天津租界內的肉蔬不是因爲有英兵保護而才得通過？</p>
<p>爲甚麼日本不馬上進佔天津英租界呢？那并不是因為張老先生的太極拳式的外交使其忌憚，而是界內及海口有著不少的英國的大砲，要是吃這塊肉而不免要犧牲，那不是它所樂幹的。現在時機是那麼嚴重和急迫，而張老先生若還只是滿口「和平」，只有撤退僑民及靜待日方悔悟的話，則長夜茫茫，惡夢正多，那怕不僅天津英租界不久將要完全成爲死市，而香港新加波恐亦未必能安然高臥了吧。</p>
<h3>給無名英雄</h3>
<p>— 時光</p>
<p>朋友：我是最怕孤獨，和冷靜的一個入，我對於孤獨和冷靜，正彷彿漆黑一團的無燈無星月之夜，處身於萬丈深淵，要爬過幾萬隧道一般的使我駭拍。</p>
<p>在戰前。我有着許多互相了解，互相同情的朋友，常常聚在一起，所談的多半是世界現狀，國際形勢；一般朋友們也慷慨，豪爽，熱心，努力，負責，竟超過了一般的男子。可是戰後不久，兩個失踪了，失　將近二年；一個犧牲了，她犧牲的時候正是去年今日！</p>
<p>祇有我在今天，還孤零零的居留在這魔島上，過若弱文子的生活，一切都成了我的囘憶。但我並不沉悶：你們，殉道者是光榮的死去了，然而你們己成就了自己底志願，你們的偉大精神是永還存在着的。</p>
<p>啊。友人，遺會；又是一個消息傳來，我幾乎不相信我的耳朶，你又爲國捐軀了，眞的你死了，我笑，我笑你的求仁得仁，一個生長在海外的僑胞，會犧牲到烽火連天的祖國的懷抱裏來，從美國流浪到中國，血染沙場，那是何等偉大呀！</p>
<p>你是一個充滿了朝氣的靑年，在隊伍裏，你更刻苦地担負着責任。入伍不到一個月，你就一人而兼四職。上火線衝鋒有你當先，敎練弟兄們由你去，編大衆歌曲敎老百姓唱，辦壁報，也是你。</p>
<p>我還記得：「環境是這樣，但我得改造環境，和環境鬥爭！」是你說的。</p>
<p>「朋友，希望你勇往直前。不錯，環竟是要我們去創造的呀！」當我聽到你講述起那地方的某種特殊情形時，總是這樣勸你，我們初會時，你給我們的印象就很深刻，我們是這樣的互相認識了，但其間竟沒有更多的機會作竟日之長談，因爲大家都忙啊：　是剛毅而老成，極其機警，遇到一件困難的事情，兩個　請常會　作深黑色。你同情着世界上所有的被壓迫者，甚至親自去當碼頭工人，也到工廠裏去做過小工。像你這樣的孩子，還是生在資產階級家庭中的人，究竟是少數啊！</p>
<p>從今以後，你安然長眠在祖國的溫暖妁泥士中吧，磷磷白骨和鮮紅血肉，都做着在成長巾的新中國的肥料。不久的將來，這塊土地上會長着更美麗的蓓舊的。</p>
<p>啊！偉大光榮的死者，永還在我們心裏活着的無名英　，會麼時候，我　帶一束鮮花，　開幕前的　　　肅穆他献在你的面前</p>
<h3>撲向了祖國</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>靜聞偏着頭忿忿地說。</p>
<p>「那倒不一定，不過多一番手續就是了。」</p>
<p>「可是——」靜聞的臉轉向青芷，爲什麼那些頭等客人就能上去尼？」</p>
<p>那誰知道，反正小社會，大社會都是那一套，怎麼也跳不出去！」</p>
<p>她們無可如何地走囘艙房，把鬥關了，就躺在床上去睡。聽不見輪船行進的聲。反而有點覺得寂寞起來了，把艙門打開，嘈雜的人聲，又使人的心煩亂。</p>
<p>「無論如何我們也該打起一點精神來，因為我們回到祖國的懷抱裏來了」。</p>
<p>靜開了像自解似地這樣說了一句。</p>
<p>「路總是一步步地走的，我們先從×人的魔手出來，漸漸就能走到我們也去的地方。好着，那些房字眞有趣，簡直像小玩具一般疊在那裏，你看那電軍要那麼小、人　那麼小、……」</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>內地來的呼</h3>
<p>— 綸子</p>
<p>來吧，朋友們！如果你們不打算來的，你們一定要來；如果你們打算來而還想慢些來的，你們早此來</p>
<p>我知道你們在孤島上不滿意。你們有的在讀書，却是不定心，因爲上海根本不是讀書的地方，而現在爲尤甚。你們有的在作着一些小事，勉張可以餬口的職業，却覺得無聊，以爲這樣工作着，太沒有意義。你們有的在閒蕩着，或者史受到生活的壓遍，乏味得無以復加。你們大家都想過得滿意些，痛快些。</p>
<p>那末，奇怪，你們為什么不到內地來呢？內地有的是自由，你們做什么便什么。內地有的是朝氣，可以使一個頹廢的人奮發起來。內地遍是有意義的工作，有力的可以肩槍，有口才的可以宣傳，有專門技能的可以適當地用得其長。內地不但沒有生活的憂慮，更富於生活的實感。你們為什么不來呢？</p>
<p>你們一定來，並且早些來！你們知道，我們的痛若漸漸過去了；我們的光明就在目前了；我們一切偉大的目的，就是達到了。你們不肯來迎接這樣一　時代麼？你們不肯來參加這個時代的實現麼？你們賴在孤島上，如果不是存心等候作亡國奴，難道又存心現在袖手旁觀，而將來則坐旱其成麼？你們竟沒有志氣麼？沒有雄心麼？</p>
<p>自然你們也有種種困難，使你們不得脫身。但是你們忘了「有忘者事竟成」這句千古不磨的格言麼？只要你們有志，我相信你們的家庭牽累，一定可以解决；只要你們肯向別人詢問，你們一定可以找到適宜的途徑。</p>
<p>請你們暫閉你們肉體的耳目，用心靈的耳聽一聽，我們在喊着你們，請你們就來參加不久就要舉行的喜筵；用心靈的目看一看，我們在向你們招手，請你們來和我們一同打退侵略者，然後一同建設我們的新中國！</p>
<p>來吧，孤島上的朋友們！</p>
<p>無名戰士</p>
<h3>古城</h3>
<p>— 李衢</p>
<p>——徐州突圍囘憶記——</p>
<p>早說只有二十里的古城，不想直走到黃昏時，才算到了這悠遠的宿營地。</p>
<p>拖着疼痛着的兩隻脚，跨進了給暮靄籠罩着，四面包圍着綠樹　顯得那末淸幽的古城裏，心裏忽然浮起了一縷悠然的情思：這就是張翼德守過的那古城嗎？記得小時看三國演義上的那畫圖，關雲長斬蔡陽時，張翼德還蹲在古城的城樓上敲着鼓在助威，難道剛才跨過的那低矮的柵子門樓上，身軀高大的張將軍也會蹲得下去嗎？——也許這城門不是從前那城門，但這城究竟是不是張翼德守過的那古城呢？請考古家們去考考吧！</p>
<p>這城只是一個約有兩三百戶人家的市鎭，屬亳州管，在平日似乎還相當熱鬧，但現在已被殘暴的飛機光臨過幾次，人民已被炸跑了，城裏充滿了怕人的凄凉，街兩旁的房子完全緊關着，狗也不知隨着主人逃到那裏去了，連一聲歡迎的吠聲也沒有，在稀薄的夜色裏，只有幾隻蝙蝠張着黑翼，迅速的來往飛着，像是代替着孩子們在玩遊戲似的。</p>
<p>找到了一間　大的空屋內什麼也沒有一點遮蓋的，便躺下來了，</p>
<p>「命令！」一個人在門外打着門。</p>
<p>開了門，一個傳令兵走了進來：</p>
<p>「師長的命令：叫楊同志趕快到毫州去偵察，我們在路上衝散了的隊伍，到毫州沒有？趕快要和他們取得連擊……」</p>
<p>那傳令兵走出去了，睡在床上的楊同志跳下牀來，搔着頭：</p>
<p>「這黑夜怎麼走呢？我又沒有到過亳州……」</p>
<p>那時，亳州正在打着仗；但不去行嗎？</p>
<p>猶豫了一會，楊同志換上了一身老白姓的衣服，隨着一個無導走出去了。</p>
<p>屋裏的人又睡下不久，一個命令又傳了來：</p>
<p>——今夜四點鐘出發，目的地坵渠集……</p>
<p>還沒有到天亮，人馬雜沓的從每間房裏走了出來，馬蹄聲，水壺和刺刀的碰擊聲，爭濁的脚步聲……混做一團，在沅睡着的古城裏響着，死僵了的古城似乎又復活起來了！</p>

<h3>×××。不能新生！　潮汕的苦難與展望</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>參加潮僑學會幹部會議之後</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>爲國仇，爲鄕誼，潮僑學會於前天晚上假南華學院樓上開救濟桑梓的緊急會議。張家彥、王永戰、王猷建，林天鐸，陳昌尉，蔡楚生，羅吟圃等理事都撥冗出席。列席者有陸浮，蔡漢蓀，蔡削天，黃心競，林高，朱奇卓等。在平日，這該是一個天時，地利，人和無不具備的歡叙，可是，家鄉的漫天烽火，人間的罪惡與恥辱，沉重地壓在旅外游子的心頭，舊恨新愁，誰有興致去理會獅子石道接連郊野那美麗而恬靜的夜景！</p>
<p>汕頭與香港間已有輸船往來，郵政却未通，洋行專送信件經巳抵港，汕頭運到傷兵數在數百以七，沿潮汕鐵路我有劇烈抵抗是千眞萬確的事實，新聞報道雖然還有弱點，可是，强調失敗理論，過度悲觀頹喪，亦是不該有的現象，——你一句我一句，互相傾訴之後，直到八時許，就正式開會了。</p>
<p>主席林天鐸氏首先致詞：「我們的家鄉汕頭，潮安相繼失陷了！×人的陰謀，我們早已料到，在整個戰局看來，是用不着悲觀的，可是，難民流離失所，以及其他的工作，在等着我們去完成，應如何做法？請諸位發表意見」。</p>
<p>「君從故鄕來，當知故鄕事」，永載君這樣提議，大家和議，林高君就站立起來，十分沉痛地把汕頭淪陷的經過，源源本本地報告出來，讀者要知其詳。請閱林君的汕頭淪陷目擊記——連載於本報國內版。</p>
<p>接着，C君報告列席潮僑籌賑兵災難民會緊急會議的經過。並謂家鄉父老對於家鄕之淪陷，有難言之痛。解釋整個局勢的發展及協助籌賑工作，我們學會應負起這個責任。</p>
<p>開始討諭第一項就是希望集中旅港潮人、在救濟家鄕旗幟之下，發揮各個崗位的最大力量，集中所有力量爲家鄕爲邦國做點應該做的工作。方式先由學會致函潮僑籌賑兵災難民會表示願參加協助工作、使商界與文化界密切聯系、如蒙該會同情，就推派林天鐸，王猶建，羅吟圃，蔡削天四君，爲學會全權代表。</p>
<p>潮汕的命運，是整個國家命運之一環。沒有苦難，就沒有新生，等到把×人趕出潮汕領土之日，就是建設新潮汕開始之時。是不會起生機的；新生命是不會產生的；　爐中經不起磨練，純鋼是不會鍛練出來的。整僑國家是要抗戰，亦要建國，潮汕一環，亦是要抗戰，亦是要建設，</p>
<p>當前的課題，是如何支持潮汕的持久抗戰，與如何做建設新潮汕的開始工作，新的潮汕不僅是消減了外侮，而且是翻開了歷史的重壓，政治澄清了，大家互相提携，團結一致努力向上了。我們要把這般意思慰勉海內外的潮籍同鄉聊盡港僑文化人的責任——大家同意這獻議，宣言由C君起草交執委會通過。</p>
<p>除宣言之外，還應該出版小冊子，登載潮汕淪陷經過，並約請港僑文化人撰文，使行動有正確的指標，分散的力景集中起來，辦法是成立編輯委員會，推舉蔡楚生，羅吟圃，陳昌蔚，蔡漢　，蔡削天，張家彥，王永載，吳其敏，朱奇卓等為委員。</p>
<p>救濟失學事生及指導逃難舉生，亦是家鄉的百年大計。决定成立潮汕學生救濟委員會，推林天鐸，王猷建，張家齋，蔡漢蓀，王永載，爲委員。</p>
<p>潮汕有潮汕的特殊方言。抗戰建國的潮汕歌劇運動，有大規模展開之必要，本港亦不乏愛好歌劇的靑年的生命力芷在等着發展。遂舉出永載君負責計劃，這儸問題，蔡楚生，譚友六諸戲劇界先進亦早已注意過了。她們一定會多多加以指導的。</p>
<p>關於參加各界賬聯會事，推陸浮君負責接洽。最末的一項討論，就是决定於七月八日下午一時，在勝新酒店舉行全體會員大會；曁歡送本會代表L君出國，希望他出國後，調查南洋，美洲一帶潮僑的狀况，並發動潮僑的組織與團結、共同爲救　救國而努力。</p>
<p>直至十二時許才告散會，在歸送中，還暢談潮汕受了訓練的廣大靑年，一定會更努力發動和組織起無數的老百姓一起，協助政府，與軍隊發展潮汕的游擊戰爭，這些艱苦實幹的靑年，是民族的靈魂，是家鄉的新生命，中國是有辦法的，潮汕亦是有辦法的。</p>

<h3>孤島的新事業　女子擦鞋公司</h3>
<p>皮鞋是最風行而普遍的一種　具、不很上層階級人穿着、就是一般中等人、甚至勞働者都有購買慾、最低限度的話、也要在馬路邊舊貨攤買一雙便宜貨、因此皮鞋業在無形中非常發展、由需要而必求精、因此皮鞋的花樣。也隨着時代進化、由平跟而進步為高跟、由圓頭而至尖頭、最近又新出了一種奶油皮底……等很多很多的樣式、確實是很合大衆的需要、不過奶油底……等高貴皮鞋、是上層公子少爺、小姐們的履具、他們是沒有一處不考究的、又因了考究之故、特地想出了一個以女子代替他們來擦皮鞋、使他們的皮鞋沒有一時一刻不保持着光亮、這自然是公子少爺、小姐們的幸福、</p>
<p>女子擦鞋公司一定設立在豐場的附近、如跑馬廳畔的『麗足女于擦鞋公司』內部裝璜極簡單、除了五六個女子以外、便沒有什麼、　們的裝束很奇怪、好像一個半女學生、又似女工模樣、逢到主客光顧的時候、很殷勤的招侍上坐、伊就開始工作——擦鞋、伊們的擦鞋的確是富有經騐、每次的收費漆皮一角四分、香賓一角四分、普通七分、擦白粉四分、全天的營業時光最忙的要算是華燈初上時候、因為許多紅男綠女們已在出勤、他們為的是要出風頭、源源的向那裏跑進去、大有應接不暇之勢、伊們的營業也出於例外、大約要夜半十一時才停、正適合了狂遊者的口味、</p>
<h3>爲籌難民給養費哈同花園將開放　國際收容所附設無線電班訓練六個月表演成績不惡</h3>
<p>上海難民的給養、始終成為一個問題、許多主持難民收容所的人士、都在焦慮着難民以後的經費、最近聽說有人在向哈同花園主人接洽、希望能開放一次、開放以後的門票、最少可得十幾萬元、暑期中兩個月的難民經費、倒從此可以有個下落</p>
<p>據說哈同太太還沒有答應、為了數十萬難民的食養、好做善事的哈同太太、似乎也不應該再堅持下去、如果這一計劃能實現的話、這倒是眞眞的大好事、</p>
<p>一二十年前、哈同花園曾開放過一次、（據說內部風景極佳）現在如若再開放、確是一樁稀有的盛舉呢！</p>
<p>以上這個消息、只能算是附帶的報告、</p>
<p>最近，為了去訪問馬斯南路上第一國際收容所裏附設的難童無線電訓練班、同時也得到一個不幸的消息、就是這收容所奉了總會的命令、現在已在疏散難民、使一般有家鄉有職業的人、慢慢離間收容所、想在最近期內把收容所結束、</p>
<p>雖然我們不能說難民必需水遠依靠難民收容所、但救濟會經費的支絀、却于此可見的、</p>
<p>第一國際收容所的地址、本來是震旦大學的操場、震旦也曾催過幾次、要收囘自用、看上去、這第一收容所不久就得結束的、</p>
<p>昨天我去的時候、就看見收容所蘆蓆棚門前、堆滿了包裹與零星物件、大概這就是離所難胞們的物件吧、</p>
<p>我和所中主任潘先生及敎育組主任李馥承先生作了半小時的談話、承他們領我參觀無綫電班的課室、時間已經中午了、十六七歲的男女難童、正在他們敎室的桌子上吃他們最淸苦的午餐、</p>
<p>十一日那天、他們這班無綫電班、曾經請上海幾家無綫電公可的經理、如李維壽、楊樹芬諸先生担任評判、舉行了一次無綫電通報的表演、</p>
<p>表演的方法是用一張英文稿子、由敎授用無綫電碼發來、當場由男女學生收下來、第二步由學生自發自己收、</p>
<p>據說、那天表演的成績不壞、</p>
<p>李馥承先生說、這訓練班的學生、本來是由國際收容所的三個牧容所裏自已保送的、此外旁的收容所也保送很多人、</p>
<p>開始辦的時候、大約有五六十人、後來把視覺聽覺不靈敏的剔除、現在全班人數有三十四人、女生有六七人、</p>
<p>訓練的步驟共分兩種、第一、是初級訓練班、注重收報發報、第二是高級訓練班、注重收發報機的修理及裝置、訓練時間是六個月、</p>
<p>應現在時間課程的支配、六個月當然是相當短促的、如若學生能下點苦功、當然也可以應付了、</p>
<p>據潘主任說、六個月訓練完畢、出路可以完全無問題、因為各處大量需要這項人才、</p>
<p>担任敎練的是張和卿、汪壽齡二先生、他們都是完全盡義務、並不支取薪給、這種精神、很可佩服、</p>
<p>所中的生產方面、又在計劃製造紅藍墨水、經過好多次的試騐、這計劃已得總所的同意、大約不久就可以製造出品、</p>
<p>據說這第一收容所中的難胞、每一個人都是生產工作者、有些是外面有職業的有些是所中做工的、一個收容所能到如此地步、的確已很不容易了、</p>
<p>附帶又參觀了所中為難胞們所設的托兒所、我參觀的時候、大約有十數個六七歲的兒童、坐在一張矮的長方桌上吃飯、個個都又肥又胖、中間有一個站起來對我一鞠躬、我對他笑笑點點頭、他馬上轉進去對他的小伙伴晚、</p>
<p>「他對我點點頭呢！」</p>
<p>我和潘先生李先生聽了都笑起來、</p>
<p>孩子們的天眞、這地方是够可愛的、</p>
<h3>電珠工人生活</h3>
<p>— 雁</p>
<p>由於一個朋友的介紹、使我有機會去參觀了一下某電珠廠工場的工作實况、並詳細的訪問了那裏男女工人們的生活、下面就是筆者把那裏訪問所得的、各部門工人生活的情形的記述、</p>
<p>捒S的</p>
<p>小電泡之中的燈絲、它的裝置的形狀、宛如一個『S』字、所以揀燈絲在一般的電珠工人們說起來、是稱它為「揀S」、揀S這工作是女工們擔任的、她們的年齡都在十五至二十五左右、因為唯有這樣年靑的婦女、她們纔有着耐心、能精細週到地勝任這工作、這是極長度而最織細鋼絲、經過工程師的科學方法的柔鍊和剪軋後、才適用於電珠上裝配的燈絲、必須經過一下整理和選剔、她們需要具有銳利的目光、否則這極微的『S』幾乎不易見到、所以、工作極費視力和腦力的、整天到晚伏在案頭上、往往使她們目眩、頭昏、背酸、她們的工資、雖較一般的女工為稍高、但每天也只能賺到五六角與七八角、</p>
<p>製S的</p>
<p>這是以　熔的玻璃管把兩條燈絲黏攏來、而屬於男工們的工作部門、他們終日坐在烈性的自來火爐的旁邊、不住地勞作、不論冬天或夏天、終是流着滿身的大汗、濕透着衣襟、他們的窒息和難耐、和着大熔爐旁的鐵匠、是沒有分別的、他們在各部門工人中是比較艱苦的一種、可是他們的工資極有限、大約僅和揀S的女工們差不多、</p>
<p>吹泡的</p>
<p>這部門是由男女童了担任的、她們的年齡多在十歲至十四歲左右、她們的工作較製S的工入們更為痛苦、因為他們終日在烈性的自來火爐旁勞作、口內又要啣住着極熱的玻瑙管、對準着火燄吸著、吹着、吸着、直至溶成流質的玻璃、吹成泡子的形式而後已、他們大約為着尚在學習時期的關係、所以工資便微簿得可憐、每月僅有一元至三元左右、</p>
<p>抽空氣</p>
<p>這是重要工人所担任的一部門、他們必須具有科學和化學的智識、便是、當玻璃泡子吹成以後、必須用化學物品和科學方法把它的空氣抽凈、然後才能把銅頭子和燈絲裝配上去、他們的工資比較一般的男女工人都要高、大槪每月自四十元至七八十元、</p>
<p>黏石膏</p>
<p>把銅頭子裝配到泡子的上面去、必須黏此石膏、這也是女工們的工作部門、她們不論老幼都有、她們的工資是包工制度計算的、每千隻以二角至三角計算、所以她們的工作雖比較容易、但她們的收入、每月倒也能得到自十餘元至廿餘元、</p>
<p>湯錫的</p>
<p>要把「S」和銅頭子穩牢聯繫、除了石膏的黏力外、更須在頂上燙以錫、因為這是比較容易做的一部、所以只是由童工中比較稍長的男工們來擔任、但他們的勞苦、比較製S和吹泡的、也不相上下、他們的工資、每月自四元至六七元、</p>
<p>揀泡子</p>
<p>這是各部門中比較最易的一部、只需把製成的泡子中有損壞痕跡的、都揀選出來、這是由最初入廠的女工和東工擔任的、工資也僅有一元至三元、此外、也有包工制度的（限於女工）或臨時僱用的、揀就每千只以三分計算、每天能獲三五角不等、</p>
<h3>滬兩租界電車公司　使用代幣券　財部補救滬上銅元缺乏將發分券運往消除困難</h3>
<p>滬市銅元映乏、各業均感因難、英、法兩租界公共汽車、電車公司、已使用代幣券、以便乘客、財部將仿照內地銷元缺乏辦法、發行分券、運滬補救、故短時內銅元缺乏風潮、可望逐漸消除、茲分誌各情如、次</p>
<p>法電車公司代幣券</p>
<p>法租界電車公共汽車、因拒收郵票印花、營業上殊感困難、公司當局為謀補救、已於昨日起使用代幣券、此券計分一分、二分、兩種、係用卡紙製成、中英文對照，限用於法租界內，茲錄該公司事務總管維亞利之通告云。『本公司之一分二分代幣券、祇適用於法租界內、每一售票員、最多領取二元為限、以代法幣缺乏、卽遇非必要時、不得隨意找給』、</p>
<p>公共租界電車公司</p>
<p>公共租界英商電車公司自銅元缺乏風潮後、雖不拒用郵票印花、但賣票員賣票時及核算票價時、均顯增困難、故與法租界電車公司採取同一步驟、亦發行二分、三分、兩種、係用薄卡紙印成、三分淡湖色、二分糙米色、頗易辨別、券上印有中英文說明、並印着紅色阿刺伯字「3」、「2」、中女之「三分」「二分」、則係空心字、券之下端、軋有綫眼、上端則編印號碼、該公司規定、此項代幣券除在車上通用外、並得向蘇州路一八五號該公司辦事處兌現、</p>
<p>財部將發分券補救</p>
<p>各業以郵票印花、為營業上之零戊、因日久漸不以為怪、故恐慌情勢、已不若初時之嚴重、查滬市銅元偷運出口問題、在國軍西移後、卽已發生、故政府方面、早經注意及此、據銀錢界消息、財部定將仿照內地缺乏銅元辦法、發行分券、運滬補救、故銅元缺乏困難、短時期卽可望消除、</p>

<h3>新安定金融辦法盛慕傑</h3>
<p>（上海特訊）八一三戰事發生後、財政部為定安金融起見、曾施行非常時期安定金融辦法和補充辦法、經過二十二個月的運用、尚無大窒碍之處、最近財部又在平準基金委員會調整匯價之後、于六月二十二日起確行一種新的安定金融辦法、內容非常簡單、大要是自二十二日起對于存款的支付在五百元以內支給法幣、五百元以上的以匯劃付給、八一三以前的存款仍照安定金融辦法去辦理、至於匯入內地的資金不受此項辦法的限制、同時此項辦法亦限于在上海施行</p>
<p>戰期中上海金融狀况、起初因有安定金融辦法的施行、狀態雖然緊張、可是危機是相當輕微、但是安定金融辦法日久漸漸失其效用、同時因有劃匯貼現制度的產生、愈加使安定金融辦法削弱封鎖資金的效用、到今年、上海金融上不安的現象逐漸顯露出來、我曾經就這兩點上加以論述、第一、上海金融因資金充裕而生的結果、實在不容漠視、因上海資金充裕、金融業活期存欵增加頗多、但上海旣缺少正當運用的途徑、而資金內移開發西南、又因環境關係未能充分利用、因之大部份資金轉用於投機事業、結果造成租界物價高翔與工業畸形發展、此種現象非但不利於上海金融市場的安定、且與政府戰時金融政策背道而馳、第二、外匯上的壓力、上海的對外貿易本年五個月的入超累計約在一萬萬元左右、而逐月貿易情形、進口增加、出口滅退、入超累積愈多、外匯數額需要愈鉅、同時日偽的套置、亦是虎視耽耽、所以安定金融辦法到現在差不多等於具文了。</p>
<p>自從六月七日外匯平凖基金委員會調整匯價之後、外匯市場顯然處於不安的狀態之下、現貨行市雖與匯豐銀行掛牌價相等、可是期貨則極其萎縮、現期差額甚大、套利高到五分、因之投機者紛趨套利的一途、上海金融在此種局面之下、頗現緊張狀態、拆息、劃匯貼現、日趨高升、倘對此種現象沒有一種辦法來限制它的發展、則對調整後的匯價仍是非常有害的壓力、故為求匯市安穩起見、祗有對於法幣加以約東、——這便是新安定金融辦法施行的最大理由、</p>
<p>新安定金融辦法施行後的利益、最顯然的便是減少外匯上投機的需要、和平衡現在帶有投機性的商品價格、最顯然的弊害便是商業一、的週轉不易、同時因辦法太簡單、施行起來便有幾多矛盾、譬如一張超過五百元的劃頭支票存入銀行、有的是收的。有的則不收、說是匯劃、前者當然是對的、後奢則不免誤會了、因為劃頭本來能付現的、現在財部的新辦法、不過說祗能每五百元一星期地支取而已、支取超過五百元以上的給與匯劃、並未說劃頭已變成匯劃了、總之、上海的銀錢業最好再擬出一個詳細的補充辦法來、在封鎖資金的原則下仍能靈活商業的交易、</p>
<p>最後、新安定金融辦法實行後、匯劃貼現的制度實在應當設法取銷、否則超過五百元以上的數額卽是匯劃、資金仍無法封鎖的、</p>

<h3>中國藥材舖風光</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>一爿中團藥鋪、除非有上約一千種不同的、自低廉的皮橘起至昂貴的羚羊角止的藥草申殼興石礦、是不够稱為完備的。</p>
<p>照最低的佔計、其中約有四百種藥味、日常在應用着。而依據了醫生的指示、某種藥材須先侵入密糖或人乳、有些更須興盬或米酒煮過後、才可應用。</p>
<p>中國的藥物表、誠如一家水菓店事的目錄然、例如、夏天被當作冷飲品的西瓜、就在治熱病的藥味裏佔着重要的位置、其餘荷葉、蓮心、橄欖（尤其是西藏的乾的一種）、杏仁、桂圓、柿子、批杷輿生梨等、也均是治咳的特效藥、</p>
<p>中國的藥物表、又像是動物園裏的名單、虎骨是可以治風濕病、其他又有龜甲、羚羊角、蟬衣、鹿茸（每盎司值價三百元）、死了的蠶、犀牛角、蠍子與蜈蚣等等、其中最後兩種、則比較很少用到、</p>
<p>此類中有三種奇罕而高貴的東西、值得來提一提、其一就是馬寶、據說在蒙古與滿洲的畜牧場裏、吾們可以發見一種性情奇特的馬、它常常在月下施深呼吸、而一連幾天不進飼食、將它殺死後、吾們就可以在它的胃裏、得到一種哽似石塊的『寶物』、乃是醫治神經病最好的藥品、又在牛與狗的骨裏、也有此種硬塊存在——這三種藥材、只有在幾家大藥舖裏才可以買到、</p>
<p>另一些中國藥材、又像一家雜貨店裏的東西、其中有治寒症的薄荷、治胃痛的大蒜、酒醋與鹽等、最後一種、據云是用來醫治內熱的、</p>
<p>中國藥材大多是草根之類、其餘　以石礦與甲殼佔多數、各種藥材都須向專地去採辦、雖然、有許多小藥舖也向他地去買了價廉的東西來當眞品出賣的、</p>
<p>藥鋪裏都以兩為單位。犬多數藥村雖都是只有幾分錢一兩、一帖兩服的普通的中國藥、倒總要在一元錢左右、</p>
<p>在中國藥　裏當先生的、要經過長期的訓練後、才能勝任、靠牆壁排列的、筐是藥抽屜、每一只抽屜裏、則放着各種藥村、配藥的人必須先知道這些抽屜置放的程序、所以、非讀過三年的學徒生涯、一定不能夠知道一千種不同藥味、是怎樣地放置着的、</p>
<p>與外國藥房的將藥方拿到製藥室裏去不同、中國藥鋪的配藥先生是當了顧客的面、來撮配各種藥味的、他先將藥方放在櫃台上、然後、在櫃台與抽屜之間走着、從各只抽屜裏、他取出各種不同的藥來放在幾張小的方紙上、</p>
<p>一張普通的中國藥方、載有九至十三種藥味、所以、他就要如此地往來上次、當他將最後的一種藥味秤好的時候、一個對藥的先生跑來一一地查看一番、看配藥的有否錯誤、之後、在他藥方上蓋了一負責的印子、配方的再跑來一一地甩一毬軟的、上印此種藥味的名稱與功效的紙張、將各種藥味、都包了起來、</p>
<p>一個平常人眞不知道怎樣用一張四寸見方薄紙、包起一定量的藥來、他一定會覺得不是紙太小、就是紙頭被摺得很皺、或甚至於是破了、然而、中國藥舖裏的先生、却能够包得很快、並且很齊整、</p>
<p>於是配藥的更將各種包子用了一張大紙似起來、頂上放了那張藥方、而用細繩包紮完事、價銀照例是寫在藥方上的、在平日、吾們總可以得到一個九扣、每逢國曆或廢暦的初一月半、再可以有一個額外的九扣得到。</p>
<p>有幾家中國藥鋪、又在免費贈送棗子或其他的甜品、以使病人在嘗飲藥湯後得聊解苦味、</p>
<p>現在，更有代各煎藥的，他們將煎好的藥湯，分裝在兩只熱水　裏，每服只取五分。中國醫生很少有對病人說明，藥湯到底當在飯前或飯後飮服的，但是一般人都相信，在飯前服下較好，否則藥品的功效，很容易被飯食沖淡，</p>

<h3>上海的小學敎師</h3>
<p>— 毅</p>
<p>小學敎師、一般的說來、是敎育界中最淸苦的了、他們一天忙到晚、所得僅足以糊口。上海雖是個繁華的都市、可是小學敎帥的淸苦。也不能例外。</p>
<p>小學敎師的資格、有下列數種、（一）師範學校畢業生、（二）大學肄業、（三）中學畢業生、（四）幼稚師範畢業生、（五）其他、上面所說的中學畢業生、包括高中及初中畢業生而言、幼稚師範畢業生、大都以担任幼稚園敎員為最理想的出路、而都是女性、其他　項、包括前淸秀才、及一般私墊出身者等。</p>
<p>小學敎師的待遇、雖視學校的情形而不同、大致說來、在往常、公立的小學比私立的小學、則視其校務的發達與否、而異其敎員之待遇、一般的情形、敎課以鐘點多少而定其薪給、普通一二年的敎員、每小時以三角計、三四年的以四角計、五六年的、每小時以五角計、所以一個小學敎師、每月的所得、普通終在三十元左右、每月能掙四五十元的、已是很少、一般幼稚園的敎師、普通做主任的、可得月薪三十五元左右、助敎的、則在二十元左右、這是指公立學校而言、私立的、恐怕遼不及此數了、</p>
<p>戰事以後、上海的小學敎師、除極少數外、受到了一個極大的打擊、他們的學校、大多是在戰區中、或是鄰近戰區的、因此一時不能開學、他們的生活、便發生了問題。一二幸運的、尚能在不被砲火影響的學校裏暫得一枝之棲、一大半却都是失業而度若非常悽苦的生活了、後來環境稍稍平靜、有的小學在租界上向別的學校借了一二間臨時課室、繼續施教、可是敎員待遇、眞是悽慘極了。有的小學教員、每月祇得軍馬費四五元、眞是苦極了、可是校長還在嘆蝕本呢、有的小學、在租界上另起　籬、重行開學、可是敎員的薪給、據說為了房租的昂貴、而不得不打折扣了、往常能掙三四十元的、如今祗可得二十元光景了、</p>
<p>目前因為租界上入口激增、學齡兒童、隨之大增、小學敎育竟能特別發達起來、在戰區搬到租界上來的小學校也有、新設立的也有、有的本在租界上的、竟因學生衆多、而開設分校哩、可是當小學敎員的、未必因此而得生活稍為寬裕吧、</p>

<h3>Concerning the Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Concession issue will be negotiated by the British and Japanese sides in Tokyo to seek a resolution. We already pointed out in yesterday's "Small Commentary": Recently, Japan × has been provoking Outer Mongolia on the one hand, and forcibly occupying Shantou and Dinghai on the other, announcing the blockade of Fuzhou and Wenzhou. At the same time, it is enticing and intimidating Britain. Yesterday, a sudden message of "complete withdrawal of Guangzhou × troops" was spread in this port. Although in fact Japan × may have withdrawn and transferred some of the troops stationed in Guangdong for military reasons, it can also be seen as Japan × cooperating with the ongoing great conspiracy of Wang's regime and others, rehearsing a certain posture before the negotiations with Britain!</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 27th, the Japanese side put forward two requests in the negotiations with Britain. First, the Tianjin Concession should not be used by the Chinese for anti-Japanese activities. Second, the Tianjin Concession should not be used as a base to support Chinese national currency to counter the Japanese new currency. The agency reported: "The British government cannot agree to the second proposal." Judging from Chamberlain's recent speech, the British government's attitude seems to be to accept the Japanese demands. Despite the surging waves of opposition to appeasement diplomacy from the British people, Chamberlain's government still adheres to the principle of "never giving up peace until the hope of peace is exhausted." Therefore, judging from the current situation, it can be asserted that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo will not obtain a fundamental solution to the problem.</p>
<p>However, in fact, no matter how Japan × entices and intimidates Britain, and no matter whether Britain will continue to compromise and yield to Japan, one thing will not change: the development of Japan ×'s power will inevitably increase day by day. Its contradictions and conflicts with Britain, unless Britain voluntarily withdraws from the Far East, even if Britain and Japan compromise, will not last long. What's more, despite Japan × adopting all kinds of deceptive methods, in fact Japan × has already carried out an "undeclared war" against Britain!</p>
<p>At the same time, observing all the events that have occurred in the Far East in recent years, Britain's interests are completely consistent with our country's interests. Under the crazy attacks, plunder, and killings of Japan ××, we lost the four northeastern provinces, and Britain also lost all the rights and interests it originally enjoyed in the four northeastern provinces. Our troops and political power withdrew from North China, Central China, East China, and even South China, and Britain also lost all its original rights in North China, Central China, East China, and even South China, and its overseas Chinese encountered destruction, robbery, insults, and killings by Japan ×. On the contrary, our nation's war of resistance, in order to defend our country's territorial sovereignty, is also a powerful guarantee for Britain's interests in China. Therefore, if our war of resistance compromises or fails midway, it is actually Britain's failure and loss. If our war of resistance can persist, we will surely achieve final victory, and our victory is also Britain's victory.</p>
<p>Every Chinese should know this reason, and every far-sighted British person, even the British government, has already seen it clearly. Therefore, regardless of whether the British government will compromise with Japan at present, we can assert: China is not Czechoslovakia! Britain will not and cannot treat China as Czechoslovakia!</p>
<p>No matter how the Tokyo negotiations proceed, we not only absolutely do not allow the British government to disregard our country's interests, and not only absolutely do not allow this negotiation to inflict any damage to the interests of our war of resistance, but also at the same time, we must remind our compatriots: the result of our heroic persistence in the war of resistance for two years is that we have already obtained the right to speak on the Far East issue and any international issue related to our country, and we have the right to urge all countries to respect this right. However, we must also show the international community and friendly countries an even greater power, and show that our own power is enough to defeat Japan × and the traitors, and show that the Chinese nation will never be ruled by Japan × and the traitors. Then, every Chinese who is unwilling to be a slave must be serious and tense! Especially those compatriots who are close to friendly people every day, we must enhance our self-esteem and self-confidence!</p>

<h3>On Guerrilla Warfare in Flat Terrain</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shiti</p>
<p>(1) The Importance of Guerrilla Warfare in Flat Terrain</p>
<p>1. The experience of twenty-four months of the war of resistance has proved that developing guerrilla warfare and establishing guerrilla bases in the vast areas behind and on the flanks of the × people has achieved its task.</p>
<p>A. It has mobilized and organized millions of people to fight against ×, destroyed the puppet regime, and kept most of the territory within the occupied areas of × in the hands of the Chinese.</p>
<p>B. It has consumed a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the × people, and restricted and dispersed a lot of the × people's forces.</p>
<p>C. It has shaken the morale of the × people's army and organized constant defections of the puppet army.</p>
<p>D. It has played a great role in coordinating with the regular army in strategy, campaigns, and battles.</p>
<p>2. The current war situation is in a period of transition from the first stage (× people attacking, our army strategically defending) to the second stage (× our strategic stalemate). Insisting on and developing guerrilla warfare in various areas on the flanks and rear of the × people, consolidating the original strategic support points and establishing new ones, and coordinating with operations in all aspects to achieve greater and more consumption, restriction, and dispersion of the × people, rapidly ending the first stage and transitioning to the second stage, so that the strategic counter-offensive can be carried out more guaranteed and smoothly in the third stage, is of great significance, especially in North China today, which is a more important and urgent task.</p>
<p>And in North China, there is more flat terrain than in Central and South China. Therefore, in North China, we should have the determination to develop guerrilla warfare in flat terrain.</p>
<p>If it is said that guerrilla warfare cannot be carried out in flat terrain and guerrilla bases cannot be established, it is equivalent to automatically giving up more than one-third of the territory in North China (the number I roughly calculated from the map), allowing the Japanese × to rule, letting millions of compatriots be destroyed and massacred by the Japanese ×, and letting unlimited resources be plundered by the × people. This is not only a lack of understanding of the essence and importance of guerrilla warfare, but also a lack of confidence in the development of the war of resistance against Japan. Therefore, the importance of guerrilla warfare in flat terrain should be understood from the entire anti-Japanese war, from the political, military, and economic aspects.</p>
<p>(2) Can Guerrilla Warfare Be Developed and Guerrilla Bases Established in Flat Terrain?</p>
<p>1. It is a fact that the terrain conditions in mountainous areas are better than those in flat terrain, guerrilla warfare is easier to develop, and guerrilla bases are easier to establish and consolidate. However, the main condition for establishing guerrilla bases and developing guerrilla warfare is the condition of the masses. The masses and the guerrillas are like fish and water. With water, fish can gallop freely. With the masses, the guerrillas can resist the × people and defend themselves. Whether in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, etc., the population and villages in flat terrain are always much denser than in mountainous areas. With the conditions of the masses (of course, to develop, organize, and lead), there are basic conditions that can develop guerrilla warfare and establish guerrilla bases.</p>
<p>2. Flat terrain can increase the effectiveness of air force, armored units (including tanks, armored vehicles, and armored trains), cavalry, and artillery. The × people's technology is superior to ours. These are unfavorable conditions in flat terrain. However, flat terrain also has many villages, large ditches, small ditches, mounds, gaps, rivers, forests, plants, and other terrain features, as well as the weather such as night, rain, dew, wind, and snow, which can easily conceal the troops and partially restrict the activities of the × people's technical arms. At the same time, the more the × people go deep, the longer the battle line becomes, and the less the × people's forces are allocated. Especially the × people's technical arms are limited, and most of them are used for a long time on the main battlefield, and the proportion allocated to the rear and flank guerrilla areas is very small.) It is not to say that the × people will not concentrate their forces and technology to attack guerrilla bases, but that in general, it is a minority. At the same time, automobiles and armored vehicles must have roads or better railways to travel. Tanks must rely on railway transport to hundreds of miles away from the combat area before they can be used. In order to prevent anti-tank guns, the use of tanks in densely populated areas around villages is of great concern, and the heat in the vehicle is very heavy, and the driver is mentally uncomfortable when driving from left to right. A driver must rest after working for a day. If armored trains can only run on railways, armored units are not used unconditionally, and they also have many difficulties. At the same time, we also have methods and experience to defend and resist. Therefore, in flat terrain, do not be overly afraid of the × people's technical arms. As long as there are mass conditions, a high degree of anti-Japanese sentiment and psychology, and a spirit of enduring hardship, guerrilla warfare can be generated in flat terrain.</p>
<p>3. In North China, twenty-four months of war of resistance have proved that guerrilla warfare can be developed and guerrilla bases can be established in flat terrain. In the northwest of Shandong, the northeast of Henan, the entire province of Hebei, the east, south, and north of Suiyuan, the Yanbei dam and Fenhe dam in Shanxi, not only small guerrilla teams, but also large guerrilla corps and regular corps can move freely, and large guerrilla areas have been established in Jizhong, Jidong, Jinan, and the plains in northwestern Shandong (although whether they are still consolidated or not). For example, our □ Detachment and □ Detachment operate in the flat dams of Yangqu, Qingyuan, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Qixian, Taigu, and Fenyang, fighting countless times with × and achieving constant victories, destroying the × people's puppet regime, and mobilizing and organizing a wide range of people. In particular, our □□ Detachment, in cooperation with the Security Detachment and a part of the Workers' Self-Defense Force, attacked the North Pass of Qixian in the middle of the Fenhe Dam in October and achieved complete success. When they attacked, they brought fifty oxcarts from a very far place. After the attack was successful, they transported back more than 2,000 pieces of cloth from the Japanese × cloth factory (more than 1,000 pieces were distributed to the masses on the spot, and some are still outside). This is a pioneering work and a miracle of guerrilla teams operating in flat terrain.</p>
<p>4. We are sure that guerrilla warfare can also be developed and guerrilla bases can be established in flat terrain, although it is more difficult than in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>(3) Several Tactical Issues</p>
<p>In flat terrain, we still have to apply the principle of "mainly guerrilla warfare, but do not relax mobile warfare under favorable conditions." However, the terrain conditions in flat terrain and mountainous areas are different. There are fewer opportunities to carry out large-scale mobile warfare in flat terrain, but it is not to say that mobile warfare cannot be carried out at all in flat terrain, but that guerrilla warfare is more important in flat terrain. Now, several tactical issues in flat terrain are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Matters to be Noted During Marching</p>
<p>1. In order to easily conceal and prevent air raids, it is advantageous for large units to march at night (the roads in flat terrain are flat and wide, which is convenient for night marching), but there are many roads and the terrain features are not easy to identify, so special attention must be paid to communication and liaison.</p>
<p>2. The roads in flat terrain are wide and large, so two to four columns should be adopted to shorten the marching distance, but in the daytime, in order to facilitate air defense, a considerable distance must be left between each detachment. There are many parallel roads in flat terrain. If a large group is mobilized, it can be divided into two or three columns.</p>
<p>3. During daytime marching, special attention should be paid to air defense. Every person, horse, and stretcher must be effectively disguised. When × planes are discovered, quickly leave the road and use the nearby terrain features. Even small ditches, mounds, field ridges, grass, and trees are very valuable. Regardless of whether there are terrain features to use or not, take a lying down posture. Do not densely conceal in villages. When concealing, disperse in units of squads. Commanders and dispersed troops should pay attention to liaison. At this time, special attention should be paid to the vigilance against the × people on the ground (especially the cavalry). If the air defense shooting troops, such as the × planes, have not discovered us and are not within the effective shooting range, they should not shoot.</p>
<p>4. Flat terrain has convenient transportation and many roads. The mobility of × people's cavalry, armored units, and automobiles is great. Even if the distance from × is very far, there should be concerns about encountering ×. Therefore, reconnaissance, vigilance, and combat readiness must be paid attention to at all times. There are many parallel roads in flat terrain. The vigilance troops of the vanguard, rearguard, and flank guard must be dispatched according to principles and circumstances. When resting on the way, vigilance must be dispatched immediately. Negligence and perfunctoriness are not allowed. This time, the □ Company of the □ Detachment attacked the puppet army in the flat dam southeast of Guisui and seized fifty or sixty horses. Because they did not pay attention to reconnaissance and vigilance, they were ambushed by × near Sitongzi, resulting in the loss of all the seized horses and spoils, and the loss of contact with several people. This is a serious lesson.</p>
<p>(B) Matters to be Noted During Bivouacking</p>
<p>1. The division of bivouac sites should meet the tactical requirements. Although all troops should be bivouacked together in winter and spring, if there is a lack of houses, they can be squeezed together as much as possible. The entire bivouac plan should not be affected by the relationship of the houses.</p>
<p>2. Send out vigilance first, and then enter the bivouac site. After entering the bivouac site, cadres at all levels and communicators should check the terrain, paths, and emergency assembly areas in and around the bivouac in advance. Cadres at all levels must consider the handling of the discovery of × people. There must always be duty troops to deal with temporary incidents, and the routes within a hundred miles around must be investigated and drawn into a route map.</p>
<p>3. Reconnaissance and vigilance must be strict and comprehensive. In addition to the main force sending out reconnaissance, the vigilance troops must send out reconnaissance squads or groups to continuously reconnoiter at a distance of tens of miles outside the vigilance line. The vigilance troops must prepare for force and weapons in accordance with the vigilance principles and local conditions. In general, they should be strengthened more than in mountainous areas, and the distance can be slightly faster. They must also do work and disguise. Observers can be placed on trees or roofs to disguise or in sorghum fields (using ladders, observers sitting on the ladders).</p>
<p>4. Air defense. Every bivouac site must have a dedicated air observation post, air defense alarm, and air defense shooting troops. Distinguish the shaded areas. The shaded locations should not be in the village. Small ditches, mounds, botanical gardens, forests, and all possible terrain features can be used, and single-person air defense shelter holes or four or five-person air defense shelter ditches can be made and disguised. If time permits, pay attention to the attacks of the × people on the ground, especially the cavalry. Therefore, in addition to the vigilance troops, each unit should have special ground observers.</p>
<p>In air defense in flat terrain, the most important thing to pay attention to is smoke. The air force can detect smoke in flat terrain from a long distance. It is the best marker for indicating targets to the air force. Therefore, the time for burning fire in the bivouac site should be planned and regulated. It is best not to burn fire from 8:00 to 16:00. Breakfast should be cooked before 8:00, and dinner should be cooked in turn in the afternoon to avoid finding a lot of smoke at the same time. If × air force is found, all fire and smoke should be extinguished, and it is stipulated that pits are not allowed to be burned during the day.</p>
<p>5. If you are defending against air raids, it is advantageous to station in small villages because large villages and cities have larger targets.</p>
<p>(C) Matters to be Noted During Combat</p>
<p>1. Flat terrain has convenient transportation, and × people can quickly reinforce, and the effectiveness of firepower is increased. The × people's firepower has an advantage. If the combat time is prolonged, it is unfavorable to us. Therefore, during combat, we must be more decisive, brave, and quick, and it is advantageous to resolve the battle in a short time.</p>
<p>2. Estimate the strength of the × people's firepower, so we must be good at concentrating and using our weapons, and organize firepower in a planned way. Use sudden and fierce firepower to gain the advantage of firepower in a short time. At this time, the assault team should resolutely and quickly carry out the assault. Before the × firepower is deployed, I have already approached the × people and carried out a melee, so that even if the × people's weapons are superior, they cannot be used. In combat in flat terrain, on the one hand, we must avoid and reduce the harm of the × people's weapons. This is the key to combat. At the same time, there are few opportunities for overshooting, and the number of gap shootings increases. These should be paid attention to in peacetime education.</p>
<p>3. Flat terrain is convenient for the activities of technical arms such as tanks, armored vehicles, armored trains, and cavalry, as well as the air force. Whether marching or bivouacking, we must pay attention to the defense and resistance of × technology, and strengthen the education of × technical arms in peacetime.</p>
<p>4. In combat, our commanders at all levels are often in front of the troops or in the first echelon. This is caused by the revolutionary sense of responsibility, but in this way, they are often prone to unnecessary damage, especially in flat terrain, where the firepower is fierce and it is not easy to conceal. Therefore, the position and command post of commanders at all levels should be based on the standards of being able to command the subordinate detachments and observe the situation in all aspects. They should not be too close to the front, and should be disguised.</p>
<p>5. Villages and towns are better in flat terrain, and they are often strongholds for attackers and defenders, becoming terrain features of great tactical value. According to the experience since the war of resistance, the × people often use villages and towns as strongholds when fighting with us, and we lack weapons and have some weaknesses in tactics, so it is not easy to overcome when × uses villages and towns. There are more opportunities for village combat in flat terrain. We must practically apply the past experience and lessons of village combat and the tactical principles of village combat in the troops and increase the exercises of village combat.</p>

<h3>Our Forces Fight Valiantly Near Jieyang; Shandong Changes from Defense to Offense, Advancing on Multiple Routes; Japanese Army Busily Deploying, Planning Further Offensives</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Because the Japanese army has difficulty advancing on various battlefields, they are using their navy to harass coastal areas. Our Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong forces have new deployments, and the invading Japanese will suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] The Japanese army in Southern Shandong is now on the defensive. We are advancing on multiple routes, and the overall situation is turning in our favor. In Shanxi Province, in the area between Xia County, Wenxi, and Jiang County, there have been local engagements for the past two days. In the southern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway, the Japanese army is still busily deploying, with plans for further offensives. The number of Japanese troops at Fenglingdu has decreased compared to before, but they still sporadically shell across the river. In northern Henan and eastern Henan, there are constant small engagements. Central Hubei is calm. The remaining Japanese forces in Qianjiang are still trapped.</p>
<p>Large Army Arrives in Eastern Guangdong; Japanese Troops in Chaoshan Have No Strength to Penetrate Deeper</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shaoguan, 30th Dispatch] The Japanese army in Shantou, fearing an attack from our forces from the rear, have again occupied Chao'an. Our XXX Army rushed to Chao'an to reinforce, but unfortunately, it was too late. Our XXX Division and XXX Division are currently deploying from Hailufeng to Jieyang. The self-defense corps led by Hua Zhenzhong is fighting the Japanese army along the Chaoshan Road with the XXX Division, with minor losses. Their retreat was carried out according to a pre-determined plan and did not have the chaotic situation that happened during the fall of Guangzhou last October. According to a senior staff member here, the Japanese in Chaoshan will not invade northwards. Shaoguan is difficult to sneak through because of the Luofu Mountains that obstruct the area between Chaozhou and Shaoguan. Furthermore, the Japanese who landed were naval marines, who lack the strength to penetrate into the interior. A portion of our Guangxi Province's mechanized troops has arrived north of Conghua and Xinjiekou to block the Japanese army from invading northwards.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shaoguan, 30th Dispatch] It is said that the Japanese army's invasion of Shantou is related to the ambitions of the Mitsui Zaibatsu. This is because the Chaoshan area is rich in mineral deposits, which are coveted by the Zaibatsu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Liuhuang, 28th Dispatch] According to a Jieyang phone call, the Japanese army invading Shantou dispatched two shallow-water warships carrying approximately one thousand soldiers late at night on the 26th, sailing west along the river to Guanbu, which belongs to Chaoyang. There, they switched to speedboats and went straight for Jieyang. On the morning of the 27th, they landed about thirty li southeast of the county seat, between Beizhai and Paotai City, and fled north. A small portion, about one hundred soldiers, raided Paotai City, while the majority turned northeast, passing through Pingjiao, where Chao'an and Jieyang meet, on the western side of our Fuyang-Fengxi line, intending to coordinate with the Japanese army on the front of the railway. They were ambushed and attacked by self-defense corps from various villages along the way, suffering more than half casualties. The remaining Japanese forces were met with strong resistance about ten li west of Fuyang-Fengxi, and are currently engaged in mixed combat. The Japanese forces raiding Paotai City were repelled by our counterattack and retreated towards Beizhai.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan] The Japanese forces invading Chaoshan this time number around ten thousand. Due to rising river waters, Japanese ships are extremely active. Our army, according to the original plan, fought hard on the two lines of the outskirts of Shantou City and national defense works for six days and nights, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. It is estimated that more than a thousand Japanese have been annihilated. Our army transferred to a new position at You (5-7 PM) on the 26th. Now, our reinforcements have arrived on the front lines of Chaozhou and Jieyang, and are counter-attacking the Japanese army.</p>
<p>[Express News from Daxu News Agency, Xingning] After our army in Fuyang changed positions, it made close contact with the reinforcements. Near Tiechang, the terrain is narrow, and the Japanese army did not dare to advance easily. On the morning of the 29th, multiple teams of planes attacked Tiechang, Xinxu, Xichang, and Jieyang County, bombing and strafing everywhere. Many bombs were dropped, and the extent of the damage is unknown.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 28th Dispatch] Early this morning, our army took advantage of the moonlight to launch a surprise attack on the Japanese army near Shengang in Conghua. The Japanese initially resisted stubbornly, but our artillery exerted its power, concentrating bombardment, killing more than two hundred Japanese soldiers. More than a thousand remaining Japanese soldiers were routed from Shengang in a panic, and retreated to the mountains to the east, relying on solid fortifications to hold their ground. At dawn, more than ten Japanese planes bombed and strafed our army in batches to assist in the battle. A portion of our army detoured and attacked Dagang Ridge (north of Shengang), the outer defense of the Japanese army from the south, cutting off communication between the Japanese army and Taipingchang. As of 3 PM, the fighting between us and the Japanese army was still ongoing. Also this morning, a portion of our army advanced to Wenmenlu in the southeast of Shengang, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army. Because of excessive casualties, the Japanese army was routed to Zhushiling behind them, and our army is currently in pursuit.</p>
<p>Martial Law Implemented in Fuzhou; Fierce Fighting Still Ongoing in Yuhuan Area</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 29th Dispatch] A well-known foreign military observer here stated that the Japanese army's attempt to occupy Fuzhou and Wenzhou has no military value, and occupying Shantou and Chao'an is not enough to cause major damage to the Chinese. The supply of Chinese military arms in Guangdong is transported from Chongqing, and although coastal areas have been occupied, it will have absolutely no impact on China's overall strength in resisting Japan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Chinese authorities have declared martial law in Fuzhou and are actively preparing to resist the Japanese army's invasion. Starting today, all Chinese and foreign ships are prohibited from entering or leaving the port. Chinese coastal artillery units engaged in fierce artillery battles with eight Japanese warships outside the mouth of the Min River on Tuesday (the 29th).</p>
<p>[Guomin News Agency, This Port Dispatch] Since Xiamen and Jinmen successively fell, the Fujian authorities have long been making military preparations for Fuzhou. Residents have been ordered to evacuate the old, the weak, women, and children early, to prepare for when necessary. The front lines of Fuzhou have also been deployed and stationed with heavy troops. The people of Fujian have always been rich in the spirit of resistance. This is clear and verifiable in national history. Moreover, the people of Fujian have an irreconcilable hatred with the Japanese. Tracing back to the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, pirates harassed Fujian, carrying out cruel massacres. The people of Fujian are eager to kill the Japanese, and heroes against the Japanese have emerged in every generation. Qi Jiguang and Zheng Chenggong are the most famous of them. Moreover, the mountains of Fujian Province are connected, and the terrain is naturally formed. The dangerous places at sea have been set up with artillery batteries everywhere since Li Shijia took over as commander of Mawei, and are equipped with new-style cannons. The military and civilians can cooperate effectively. They are only afraid that the Japanese will not come. Now that the Japanese are invading, they should start a bloody battle and shatter the Japanese people's dream of aggression.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] It is reported that Chinese troops on Yuhuan Island, near Wenzhou, are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops that landed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 28th Dispatch] This morning at 9 AM, more than two hundred Japanese troops were added to the Kanmen Zhiyan Artillery Battery Mountain area of Yuhuan. Zhan Yinzi, the Magistrate of Yuhuan County, still led his troops to constantly strafe and attack them. At 12 PM, Kanmen was finally abandoned due to the complete destruction of the fortifications. After the Japanese entered Kanmen, they immediately set it on fire. The fire has not been extinguished by the evening. The battle is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Artillery Battle North of Xinqiang River; Fierce Fighting Still Ongoing in Southwestern Shanxi Province</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, 29th Dispatch] On the morning of the 29th, sporadic artillery fire was again heard north of the Xinqiang River. It is assumed that the Japanese army was carrying out probing firing towards Weiwulingxia Yan'an on our north bank, lasting more than ten rounds, then stopped.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, 28th Dispatch] An artillery battle occurred north of the Xinqiang River on the 28th, which ceased after five hours. Our guard troops at Weiwuling and Majiawan on the north bank deliberately exposed targets in the morning to attract the attention of the Japanese observation teams. Before long, Japanese guns north of Changshan and Manjia Mountain concentrated their fire on the area, firing over a hundred rounds each, including poison gas shells. At that time, officers and soldiers had entered the shelters, so losses were minimal.</p>
<p>[Zhongzhong News Agency, Xingji, 29th Dispatch] The Japanese troops invading south along the Baijin Highway have recently been entering and exiting the areas of Zouma Ling, Xiyang, Niu Temple, and Gucheng (all south of Qiaodian). Their main force is still concentrated in Quindian. On the night of the 21st, our XX Division engaged in fierce fighting with them at Shanggu until the morning of the 22nd, then it became calm again. On the 24th, a portion of the Japanese army harassed southward along the highway, but retreated north after seeing our counterattack. Currently, the Japanese forces in that area are looting the people's property, forcibly conscripting laborers, searching and arresting XXX every day, and constructing fortifications and rushing to repair highways in the areas of Zouma Ling, Xiyang Niu Temple, with the appearance of a long-term occupation. We are taking the opportunity to encircle and attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 28th Dispatch] Military news: at 2 PM on the 27th, about two hundred Japanese troops engaged in fierce fighting with our army for three hours at Mulizhuang (more than ten li west of Longhua Town in Gucheng). The Japanese army could not hold out and retreated to the southeast. After dusk, the Japanese force sneaked back and was again repulsed by our army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wu XXX, 28th Dispatch] More than three hundred Japanese troops from Fengzhen invaded the Longshengzhuang area on the evening of the 14th, but were lured to the mountains. In the fierce battle until noon on the 15th, more than fifty Japanese troops were killed, and two vehicles were destroyed. The remaining Japanese troops fled west, and our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them to Shudong Shuhe and other places in Suiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 28th Dispatch] When our army attacked Wang Mao Town (north of Yuanqu) on the 16th, it surrounded the Japanese army's baggage train and annihilated them all, with no survivors. All of the Japanese supplies were captured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 28th Dispatch] A unit of our army in eastern Henan attacked the Yejigang Station east of Landaidong on the night of the 22nd, killing twenty to thirty Japanese troops and destroying a section of the railway track.</p>
<h3>National Government Establishment Anniversary; No Celebrations to be Held</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Regarding the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government on July 1st, the Central Government had previously resolved to hold a joint celebration. However, there is no need for people from all walks of life to hold celebrations on that day. Furthermore, since the start of the War of Resistance, the Central Government has decided to strive for simplicity in all celebrations. If there is a need to hold an event, the Central Government will first issue an order to all localities to comply.</p>
<h3>Disregarding British and American Objections, the Japanese Army Implements a Blockade of Wenzhou; Orders the British Hospital in Datong to Withdraw; Britain Demands a Reply to the Tinker Case</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] A Shanghai-based foreign source reports that the British naval authorities informed the Japanese side that the British Navy would send a warship to Fuzhou to protect British nationals. However, the Japanese side stated that if the British warship did not withdraw from Fuzhou before 11 AM today, the Japanese side could not be held responsible. It is reported that the Japanese side has decided to ignore the British protest and implement a blockade of the Wenzhou estuary.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] According to foreign news, the situation in various parts of South China has not changed significantly in the past two days. The British ships "Sharnet" and "Scott" are still docked in Shantou. The most recent British ship to call at the port of Shantou was the "Jiangsu" of the Taikoo Company. Other British ships are still sailing to Shantou as usual, but they are all anchored outside the harbor. There are two British destroyers in Fuzhou, and no British nationals in Fuzhou have been evacuated.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th Dispatch] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons on the 28th regarding the situation in South China, that the Japanese authorities have announced their intention to take military action on the 27th of this month against the treaty ports of Wenzhou in China. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, made a request to the British Consul-General, Mr. Fu, that all foreign merchant ships and warships should leave these ports before noon on the 29th of this month. The British Consul-General immediately rejected it, stating that the right of British ships to navigate to Chinese ports must not be infringed. The British government believes that the Japanese authorities have no right to interfere with the actions of British ships and the lives and property of British nationals.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Regarding the news that the US ambassador to Japan, representing the US government, sent a note to the Japanese government, stating that if the Japanese army occupies Fuzhou and Wenzhou, the Japanese side must be fully responsible for all losses of American nationals in the two locations, US Secretary of State Hull met with reporters yesterday and expressed tacit agreement on the matter, explaining that the US government has granted Admiral Yan Luer, commander of the US Navy in China, greater authority to deal with unexpected matters, but the power of decision-making remains in the hands of the US envoys in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Northern Ping foreign dispatch: The Japanese military authorities here have ordered the hospital run by the British Church outside Datong to withdraw from the area within one week. The hospital's superintendent, Bishop Norris, has gone to Datong to investigate everything. It is said that the Japanese side has long intended to buy the hospital. The total value of the hospital is as high as 400,000 yuan, but the Japanese side is only offering 75,000 yuan. Now they want to force the hospital to hand it over by force.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th Dispatch] The British government has issued an urgent order to British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, instructing him to demand that the Japanese government promptly issue a reply to Britain's previous protest regarding the murder of Tinker in Shanghai by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement in Qingdao; Britain Protests to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Shanghai foreign dispatch: An anti-British movement has recently erupted in Qingdao. Anti-British slogans have been posted on streets, lanes, and in front of the British Consulate. The British Consul has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Returns to Shanghai; Met with Wang Kemin and Sugiyama in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Ping foreign dispatch: After meeting with Wang Kemin and Sugiyama, Wang Jingwei returned to Shanghai. Wu Peifu insisted that he must have absolute autonomy in finance, diplomacy, and military affairs before agreeing to come out of retirement, so Wang did not meet with him.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 29th Dispatch] Regarding the news that Wang Jingwei and the Japanese government have formed an agreement to organize a "united government" with Wang as the head of state, well-informed political circles here state that this is premature. Since the two puppet governments of Beiping and Nanjing must cede some of their rights to Wang, they will definitely object. Unless the Japanese side acts as a mediator, Wang's plan will not be supported by the two puppet governments of Ningping at the meeting next month. It is also heard that Wang's relatives and friends, who recently returned from Tokyo, said that the first step of Wang's plan is to reorganize the "Kuomintang" in the Japanese-occupied areas and arbitrarily change the Kuomintang's party platform to suit the Japanese government's slogan of "Asia is for Asians." Wang is currently conducting a large-scale propaganda campaign. In the past few weeks, Wang has bought several Shanghai newspapers.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Groups Express Sympathy to Compatriots in Tianjin; Soldiers and Civilians on Eastern Battlefield Call on All Countries to Restrain Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th Dispatch] The Japanese army has blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin for more than half a month. Various trade associations and women's cultural circles in Chongqing are very concerned about the compatriots in the concessions who are in dire straits. They have sent telegrams to express their condolences and encourage them to fight to the end.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Eastern Jiangxi, 27th Dispatch] Since the Japanese army illegally blockaded the Tianjin concessions, the soldiers and civilians on the eastern battlefield have been extremely indignant. They all advocate using national diplomacy to telegraph the British, French, and American governments, strongly restrain Japan, and express sympathy and support to our compatriots and foreigners trapped in the Tianjin concessions. The party, government, military authorities and people's organizations, cultural organizations of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and the political department of the XXX War Zone have jointly telegraphed to the Central Propaganda Department to translate and transfer to the envoys of Britain, France, and the United States and the heads of state, foreign ministers, and parliaments of various countries, expressing support and asking for joint and strong restraint against Japan. At the same time, they also telegraphed to the national press and compatriots across the country, unanimously advocating.</p>
<h3>Li Hanhun Returns to Guangdong from Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Daxu News Agency, Shaoguan Express] Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun went to Chongqing on the 15th of this month to meet with the central authorities, report on the administration of Guangdong Province, and request instructions on future policies. He originally intended to stay in Chongqing for a longer period of time, but the provincial government has telegraphed urging him to return to Guangdong and preside over affairs due to the outbreak of the Chaoshan battle. It is reported that Li has already set out from Chongqing and is rushing back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] The Japanese army has repeatedly broadcasted absurd rumors in Tokyo, attempting to confuse and mislead listeners. A few days ago, they again employed their habitual tricks in Tokyo, promoting the rumor that Li Hanhun, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government and chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, has been dismissed. The reporter took the opportunity to speak with the spokesperson of the Military Commission yesterday, who said that since Li Hanhun took charge of Guangdong, he has been loyal and hardworking, and has made many achievements. The government has high expectations for him. It is the nature of the Japanese to fabricate things out of nothing, but this clumsy propaganda is truly laughable for those who are knowledgeable.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Attempt to Poison the Jiangzhe Area; Our Guerrillas are Ordered to Monitor</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th Dispatch] The Japanese army is implementing a poisoning policy in the occupied areas of Jiangzhe. A large quantity of drugs is being continuously shipped from North China to Shanghai under the control of the Japanese side by traitorous merchants, and then transferred to the interior. Our guerrillas have been ordered to severely punish these traitorous merchants once they are discovered.</p>
<h3>The Period for Stopping Traffic on the Qi'ao Highway is Pending</h3>
<p>[Daxu News Agency, Zhongshan Express] Yesterday, it was rumored that the Qiguan Car Company plans to stop traffic on the Qi'ao Highway on July 1 due to thorough destruction. According to a senior official of the 6th Guerrilla Area Command, the highways in Zhongshan County have been destroyed in segments to meet wartime needs. The Qi'ao Highway is destroyed in three segments, but it is still temporarily possible to drive in segments. As for when the destruction will be such that traffic is impossible, this will be determined by the military authorities based on observations of the situation. The Qiguan Car Company has no such power.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong Water-Land Transportation; Jointly Managed Automotive Teams Are in Operation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinhua, 29th Dispatch] The authorities of the five provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong believe that since the War of Resistance, inter-provincial trade has become increasingly developed, and the adjustment of products between the provinces is particularly urgent. They have specially prepared for joint water-land transportation in the five provinces. Now, the joint water-land transportation office for the five provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong has been formally established in Jinhua. Each province has a branch office to manage transportation affairs. The office has specially authorized commercially operated vehicles. Automotive teams with five vehicles are also operated, starting on June 11. Its journey starts from Zhejiang, passes through Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, and ends in Guangdong Province. Therefore, in the future, joint passenger and freight transportation among the five provinces will become more convenient.</p>
<h3>Chongqing China-America Cultural Association Hosts Johnson; Tea Party Scheduled for July 1</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] Kong Yongzhi, president of the China-America Cultural Association, Chen Lifu, vice president, and others are scheduled to hold a tea party on July 1 to welcome US Ambassador Johnson. They have invited representatives from China, America, and other friendly countries stationed in Chongqing to attend.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Raid Chongqing Five Times; It's Not Worth the Loss; The Japanese Spent 40 Million, We Lost 5 Million; Estimated by Foreign Aviation Experts</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Communication] Shanghai's Millard's Review commented that the recent five air raids on Chongqing by the Japanese army cost at least one million US dollars each time, five times costing five million US dollars. This is the opinion of foreign aviation experts, several of whom were in Chongqing when it was bombed. The Japanese figures are as follows: The average number of bombers participating in the air raid was 27. Each time the Japanese lost four of their planes. Each bomber of the type used by the Japanese costs approximately US$125,000. Losing four planes each time is US$500,000. Each bomber carries seven airmen, four of whom operate machine guns. Training an airman in the United States costs approximately US$100,000. If it only costs half that much to train a Japanese airman, the loss is not difficult to calculate. In addition, items such as bombs and gasoline are also considerable. Each plane carries approximately one thousand pounds of bombs, which costs an average of approximately US$1.50 per pound, so each plane's bombs cost approximately US$1,500. Since the nearest air force base is in Hankou, each plane flies for eight hours, requiring approximately 800 gallons of aviation gasoline. Shanghai's major companies sell aviation gasoline wholesale at approximately US$0.25 per gallon, so each plane's gasoline costs approximately US$200. The total cost for the entire team is approximately US$5,400. The property destroyed in Chongqing may not exceed 5 million legal tender. Therefore, the cost of the five air raids by the Japanese army has reached 40 million legal tender at the current exchange rate.</p>
<h3>A Flourishing Baoji</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>The story of Emperor Gaozu of Han "openly repairing the plank roads while secretly crossing Chencang" is something everyone finds familiar and interesting! The Baoji discussed here is the location of Chencang (facing Baoji city across the river). However, since the completion of the Longhai Railway to this point after the War of Resistance, it has emerged with a brand new, epoch-making appearance.</p>
<p>In the past, Baoji suffered from inconvenient transportation and backward education. Generally speaking, political establishments showed little progress. According to the current County Magistrate Wang Fengrui: In over twenty years since the Chinese Revolution, its power had not yet reached the county government. The so-called department clerks and officials were mostly people from the former Qing yamen, numbering from over ten to twenty. They handled the work of the departments, but received only sixty-four yuan per month, including food, lodging, and office expenses. Corruption was rampant, which was self-evident. Not to mention any administrative construction, even the county government was worse than a "beggar's shelter" in terms of living conditions. However, successive county magistrates and hereditary department clerks and officials had always accepted this with equanimity.</p>
<p>But the Baoji of today is vastly different from before. This Magistrate Wang studied engineering and originally worked in the Ministry of Industry. Chiang Kai-shek, recognizing the importance of Baoji's municipal construction, specially transferred him to this position. To implement a new administration, new people were needed, so he appointed sixteen young university graduates as assistants. However, the county government had limited funds, with each person receiving a monthly salary of sixteen yuan, while meals cost seventeen and a half yuan. To cover the shortfall, Magistrate Wang had to allocate funds from his own tax revenue commission to subsidize them. These sixteen young people were focused on getting things done and didn't care about anything else. All income and expenditures of the county government were recorded using bank bookkeeping methods, with daily clearings of each entry. If superiors wanted to audit the accounts or if there were visitors, the books could be taken out at any time to make everything clear at a glance. Such financial transparency in the county government was truly commendable. In general county administrations, foot binding and men's queues were being abandoned, but this area still needed efforts to promote it. Last month, a queue-cutting campaign was started, and in the county seat and the market town alone, over seventeen thousand queues were cut off. This shows one...</p>
<p>During wartime, the county government, together with Yue Zhi, Director of the Political Department of the ×th Reserve Division, and all personnel, vigorously promoted...</p>
<p>In terms of industry, since the War of Resistance, factories from major cities, affected by the war, have successively moved west to Baoji. These include textiles, printing, machinery, batteries, matches, soap, dyeing, etc., totaling about two hundred large and small enterprises. Each industry also has cooperative organizations, numbering up to forty-three units. Six or seven thousand unemployed workers displaced from the war zone have been resettled there. The important machinery of each factory is protected using wartime scientific methods, dispersed in the countryside, and hidden deep in cave dwellings. If we change the ancient poem "The wild goose flies in the vast sky, what does the hunter seek?" to "The factories are hidden in the depths, where will the iron crow safely lay its eggs?" to praise the safety of Baoji's underground factories, it would probably not be an exaggeration!</p>
<p>The number of ordinary air-raid shelters is almost comparable to a beehive. Enemy planes have ravaged this place twice, dropping fifty to sixty bombs. The number of deaths and injuries in the first attack was only about twenty, and the second time it was reduced to only seven or eight.</p>
<p>There was an old bad habit here: residents, whether in cities or villages, did not pay attention to public hygiene and could defecate anywhere. Later, after the ×th Division was stationed here, strict measures were taken to ban this. Sentries were posted every morning to arrest people, catching hundreds of people every day. One morning, a certain division commander even personally took action, single-handedly capturing over thirty of these "illegal manufacturers and traffickers of poison," and sentenced them all to digging air-raid shelters: "Planning it, building it, completing it in no time." From then on, illegal trafficking disappeared, and air defense was also successfully completed.</p>
<p>Baoji previously had no newspaper. Later, through the planning of the division headquarters, the Zhengzhou Popular Daily agreed to move its publication here in April, publishing a small newspaper daily, priced at two yuan every three months. The division headquarters printed and distributed methods to encourage citizens to read the newspaper, urging citizens to subscribe, with the aim of achieving one copy per household, so that people's intellect and cultural endeavors could achieve practical results together.</p>
<p>Baoji has become a communication center connecting the Northwest and Southwest. In terms of products, in addition to the cotton and wheat mentioned above, there are also the dense forests of the Southern Mountains, abundant coal mines in several places, and large waterfalls that can be used for power generation, all of which are sufficient to meet the needs of the currently numerous factories. Therefore, land prices have soared. For example, farmland near transportation routes, which used to be worth tens of yuan per mu, has now risen to over a thousand yuan. If this place does not encounter any special setbacks in the future, the prosperity of its industry and commerce, and the development of its cultural undertakings, have truly unlimited potential.</p>
<p>Civil training work is in line with the needs of wartime. Among them, able-bodied men, village chiefs, neighborhood heads, tea servers, prostitutes, merchants, refugee children, theater performers, skilled workers (storytellers, fortune tellers, and various other performers), etc., have all undergone training for more than two months, and most have achieved relatively satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The trained people have actually participated in and done quite well in tasks such as fundraising, propaganda, comfort, air defense, rescue, and reconnaissance. For example, the number of wounded soldiers transferred here from the front lines often reaches ×× percent. Whether they are old or new arrivals, the people warmly comfort them. Each theater hosts them for a show once a week, bathhouses welcome them to bathe once a week, barbershops take turns going to the hospital to cut hair once a week, and students from various schools also constantly go to the hospital to sing and perform dramas, and write letters for them. The women's comfort team (mostly composed of prostitutes, totaling one hundred and sixty-one), also goes to the hospital every week to sing and perform, or have separate conversations. The feelings of mutual friendship between the military and the people are built up day by day, which can directly encourage morale and indirectly improve social order. Prostitutes were trained in nursing and special service subjects. During the two bombings of Baoji, they were able to bravely step forward to rescue the dead and injured. In addition, they have also solved several theft cases, so they have won high praise from the general public.</p>
<p>The new construction in the county seat is primarily the installation of water filters and water pipes, using spring water from the Northern Mountains to supply drinking water for the entire city. It is said that this is the first county in the Northwest to have running water. Second is the county government's underground office, which is currently being excavated on a mountainside near the city. The design is so perfect that it seems to be more than just for the county government's temporary air defense. There is also a municipal engineering plan, which will probably be implemented soon.</p>
<p>Bao County produces very little rice. The annual output is about four hundred shi. The output of cotton and wheat is relatively high. The annual cotton production is about six to seven hundred thousand jin, and wheat is about forty-eight thousand five hundred shi. Commerce is not very developed. Among the goods on the market, the largest sales volume is for rice, wheat, medicinal materials, and printed cloth.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Situation Unresolved - Japan to Intensify Blockade - Consuls from Both Countries Have Gone to Tokyo - Rumor is Japan Will Present Four Demands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Shanghai dispatch: According to Japanese sources, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin will intensify their blockade of the British Concession starting in July. From July 1st or 2nd, all entrances and exits of the British Concession will be limited to one-way traffic. The evening curfew will also be extended. The Japanese authorities in Tianjin also stated that they cannot accept the British protest this Thursday regarding anti-British movements in various locations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Tianjin dispatch: The British Consulate-General announced yesterday that the British Consul in Tianjin, Herbert, left at 5:00 AM this morning via Tanggu on the British warship "Decoy" to participate in British-Japanese negotiations regarding the Tianjin issue. It is reported that the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Tanaka, is scheduled to leave today to participate in the negotiations in Tokyo. Yesterday, the general situation in Tianjin had eased. No incidents occurred at the Japanese military obstacles in the concessions. The local situation is now easing. General attention has shifted from Tianjin to Tokyo. At the same time, there is much discussion about the outcome of the negotiations and the impact of this meeting on British rights in North China. On Tuesday afternoon, a British tugboat carrying several Chinese and foreign passengers was forced by the Japanese military to dock at the Dalian Steamship Company pier for inspection. It was detained for several hours before being released.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tianjin dispatch: Well-informed Japanese observers recently stated that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have no objection to the British and Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. However, based on the observations of the Japanese diplomatic and military authorities in Tianjin, the following four points should be the minimum conditions for Japan to resolve the Tianjin incident: (1) The British and Japanese should jointly conduct strict inspections and suppress "terrorists." (2) Anti-Japanese elements within the British Concession should be suppressed with strict measures. (3) The economic chaos in North China should be resolved. The British should cooperate in implementing the economic policies of the newly organized North China government. (4) The 48 million yuan in reserves stored in Chinese banks within the British Concession should be handed over to the "Provisional Government of Peiping."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 29th] On Tuesday, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, held a meeting with the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, for two and a half hours. It is reported that the main issue discussed was the Tianjin incident. As for the results, nothing has been announced.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th] Regarding the Tianjin incident, sources close to the Foreign Office here stated that Britain does not intend to change its current general policy in the Far East, especially regarding Chinese currency. The 48 million Chinese currency stored in British Concession by Chinese banks should not be handed over to the Japanese. The Chinese financial issue is not only related to Britain, but Britain's policy towards China is also part of Britain's overall foreign policy. When the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, holds talks with the Japanese authorities, he should treat the Tianjin case as a local incident and try to resolve it, lest the Japanese use this case to change Britain's policy towards China. In summary, the principle of maintaining neutrality in the British Concession of Tianjin is acceptable to the government, but Britain's authority within the Concession must be maintained intact.</p>
<p>British Houses of Parliament - Day-Long Verbal Debate</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] During today's discussion in the House of Commons on the recent situation in Tianjin, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated that the supply of perishable foods remains intermittent and only a small fraction of the usual amount is being delivered to the British Concession. The British authorities in Tianjin have taken effective measures to compensate for the current shortage. A total of fifteen British residents, including one woman, were forced to undergo strip searches when crossing the blockade line, but such incidents seem to have ceased in the past day or two. Representatives of the local British and Japanese authorities will be invited to Tokyo to attend a meeting to jointly resolve all issues related to the current situation in Tianjin. Chamberlain continued, "The scope of the negotiations will be all local incidents, and will seek to determine the nature of the British Concession, maintaining neutrality while ensuring British sovereignty. In view of the convening of these negotiations, the British government anticipates that the strip searches in Tianjin and all similar incidents will cease from now on, and there is ample reason to hope that this anticipation will become a reality. In this environment, the government does not intend to consider submitting this dispute to the Council of the League of Nations based on Deng's suggestion. Regarding South China, the Japanese authorities have announced that they will implement military operations against Wenzhou and Fuzhou. The British authorities have received a request from the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, ordering all ships of third countries (including warships) to leave the aforementioned two commercial ports by noon on Thursday (the 29th). The British Consul-General in Shanghai replied, stating that the British Navy's freedom to sail to any Chinese commercial port remains unchanged, and that the British also feel that the Japanese authorities are unreasonably interfering with the movements of British ships or deliberately endangering the lives and property of British residents. The situation regarding merchant ships going to Shantou is still unclear, and negotiations between the local British and Japanese authorities are continuing."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Lord Elibank expressed his opinion in the House of Lords today, saying that the Japanese insult to Britain in China this time will be difficult to forget even after a long time. He found the Japanese government's suggestion to ask Britain to cooperate in suppressing anti-Japanese elements particularly unbearable. The word "cooperation" in the Japanese dictionary actually means "giving whatever is demanded," so he hoped that Sir Robert Craigie would not forget this point when conducting negotiations with the Japanese in the future. Japan may also request British assistance in its currency in North China. Fortunately, the British government has refused and hopes to persevere to the end, so that international trade and British trade in China will not be trampled on. The fifty million yuan in silver deposited in the Chinese Bank in the Tianjin Concession is especially coveted by the Japanese. He hopes that the British government will not hand it over. At the same time, he hopes that Japan will not press too hard, as British tolerance also has its limits. Foreign Secretary Halifax then assured Lord Elibank that the government would consider Lord Elibank's observations and hoped that Lord Elibank would absolutely trust the government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] National Labour Congress representatives Sir Walter Citrine, Dr. Hugh Dalton, and Herbert Morrison met with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in the Prime Minister's Office in the House of Commons today to discuss various diplomatic issues, lasting two hours.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Winston Churchill warned listeners in a radio address today that the situation in Europe would reach its most tense state in the next three months. At the end of his speech, he also mentioned the situation in Tianjin. He said, "I see Goebbels' Italian partner Dagay will laugh at us because of the British residents in Tianjin. However, once the security of the Mediterranean is ensured, there will be no need to send warships to the Far East, and the Japanese will also restore their inherent courtesy. Japan is mired in the war against China. Japanese blood has been spilled everywhere in China, and national strength is being greatly depleted. In North China, it is being suppressed by the Soviet Union. I don't believe that Japan will be willing to fight the British Empire before recognizing what changes are taking place in the European situation. Therefore, we should commend the government's patience and firmness in dealing with the distant problems." Finally, Churchill again called on the government to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] The Times stated, "Regarding the Tianjin incident, it would be premature to say that it will be easily resolved, but Tokyo's agreement to negotiate shows that the ambassador's policy of patient diplomacy has been successful. The differences between Britain and Japan can now be discussed in Tokyo, where the arrogance of the warlords is not as high as in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. No matter what demands Japan puts forward, the fact that this matter has been moved from Tianjin to Tokyo proves that the Japanese government is willing to seek a peaceful and reasonable solution."</p>
<h3>German-Italian Air Force Cooperation Agreement Announced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th] The German-Italian Air Force Cooperation Agreement was officially announced today. The agreement was signed by German Air Minister Goering and Italian Air Force Commander General Valle.</p>
<h3>Britain Begins Appeasement Again - Submits Memorandum to Germany - Asks When Negotiations Can Begin - How to Obtain Treaty Guarantees</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The British Embassy in Berlin has submitted the British reply to the German memorandum on the cancellation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The British Foreign Office also published the contents of the memorandum tonight, stating briefly that regardless of where Germany becomes involved in a war in Europe, Britain will not necessarily take a hostile attitude towards Germany. Britain will only become hostile if Germany undertakes aggressive actions against other countries. The German government's claim that Britain is pursuing a policy of encircling Germany is completely unfounded. Britain has no intention of limiting Germany's commercial development and has already provided Germany with a large amount of raw materials. If Britain and Germany can establish mutual trust and friendship, the British government is very willing to hold negotiations with Germany to improve Germany's economic position. The British government's wish is not only not to wage war against Germany, but also to establish British-German relations based on mutual understanding of each other's needs, and to seek to avoid conflicts with the interests of other countries. The main purpose of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is to achieve a stable state and avoid unnecessary arms races. Therefore, the agreement does not have a unilateral cancellation clause. Today, it is stated that cancellation or modification must be discussed by both parties. When the agreement was signed in 1935, it was declared to be permanent in nature and stipulated that, except for submarines, the condition for modifying the agreement was a major shift in the naval balance. Even if this situation has occurred, Germany must consult with the British government before modifying the agreement. The German government has violated these regulations and did not consult with the British government on the situation before taking the action of canceling the agreement. The British government previously notified Germany of the British Navy's planned strength. Its sole purpose was to fulfill the terms of the 1935 agreement and to allow Germany to fully utilize its 1935 quota. However, if Germany is no longer bound by the 35% quota stipulated in the agreement, the British government can no longer be bound by its past planned strength. Therefore, the planned strength has already been considered canceled. If Germany wants to seek to reopen negotiations and establish another agreement, the British government is very willing to know Germany's views on the scope and purpose of the new agreement. What it especially wants to understand is (1) When does Germany think the discussion to establish a new agreement should be held? (2) How will Germany guarantee that, during the implementation of the new agreement, agreement should be obtained from both parties on the issue of cancellation or amendment?</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th] The British Embassy in Germany delivered the British government's note on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement to the German Foreign Office last night. Hitler, Ribbentrop, and other government officials immediately convened a meeting to study the contents of the British note. The original text of the note was also published in newspapers. The People's Observer's commentary was completely negative in nature, believing that the British note did not contribute to peace and was sufficient to prove that the agreement should be cancelled. The newspaper also said that the wording of the British note was provocative, only stating that Britain had no intention of pursuing a policy of encircling Germany, while the words expressing willingness to engage in discussions were expressed in unfriendly language.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Autumn Grand Exercise - Extremely Important Significance</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 29th] It was announced here today that the Soviet Army's grand autumn exercise this year will be held in the Leningrad Military District. In political circles, in view of Leningrad's proximity to Finland in the north and Estonia in the west, the current international political situation, and the Soviet Union's insistence on guaranteeing the Baltic states, this exercise is considered extremely important.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Air Combat Again - Two More Japanese Planes Shot Down - Central News Agency Reporter Goes to Inspect</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] According to the official news agency, fifteen Japanese bombers, protected by fighter planes, flew over the area of Lake Buir today on the "Manchurian" border. Soviet anti-aircraft guns shot down two Japanese bombers, and dispatched fighter planes to intercept them. The Japanese planes eventually retreated to "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Somewhere on the Outer Mongolian-"Manchukuo" Border, 29th, 2 Telegrams] This reporter went to inspect a location on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" yesterday, and toured a week at the location which had been bombed by Mongolian planes previously. Strangely, no one there knew anything about the air combat, nor were there any signs of the Mongolian planes. It was only said that news had been received from the Buir Lake area that there had been a small-scale air battle there on the 27th of this month. A fighter plane caught fire and went down. The pilot then jumped out with a parachute. The soldier was immediately captured by the Japanese army. This reporter got to see the soldier. He was unable to say more because he was extremely shaken and also had burn wounds. The only thing known was that his name was Teraminsky, and he was 23 years old. The atmosphere is extremely tense here, and it is believed that a major war will break out before long.</p>
<h3>US Again Finances ×</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 28th] Two Japanese manufacturers recently ordered steelmaking plant machinery from the United States, valued at several million yen.</p>
<h3>British Royal Society Meeting - Ambassador Koo Speaks - Denounces Japanese Aggression - Destroys Open Door Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Ambassador Wellington Koo spoke today at the Cobden Memorial Meeting of the Royal Society, saying that Japan's acts of aggression have not only destroyed Chinese sovereignty, but "the principle of the Open Door has also been destroyed by these notorious acts." One of the main goals of Japan's policy of aggression against China is clearly to weaken and destroy the principle of equal opportunity, which in the past fifty years has proven to be a major force in stabilizing relations between China and other countries. Ambassador Koo continued, "The ultimate goal of the Japanese government is becoming increasingly clear. Its goal is to exclude all foreign interests in China obtained through commercial treaties. The instability of the commercial interests of Europe and the United States in the Japanese-occupied areas is increasing. No matter what assurances Japan provides, in fact the open door is only open to Japan's exports, not for the benefit of other foreign countries." Ambassador Koo continued to warn his listeners that if Japan once swept across China and then used this large workforce, using China as a market for its products and as a huge warehouse for its mineral and agricultural resources, then Japan would certainly "use these unlimited and immeasurable human and material resources as a tool for aggressive annexation." Ambassador Koo's speech was entitled "Open Door and World Peace." Attendance at the meeting was very enthusiastic, and all were well-known figures. It was chaired by Lord Lytton. Ambassador Koo said that in the Far East, the principle of the Open Door is not only considered the basic principle for maintaining relations between China and foreign countries, but also the basic principle for maintaining relations between countries.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain to Deliver Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a radio address at five minutes past nine o'clock on Sunday evening (standard time), entitled National Service. The broadcast will last about ten minutes.</p>
<h3>British and French Representatives Meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Yesterday - Soviet Union Recalls Chargé d'Affaires to Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] According to authoritative sources here, after French Foreign Minister Bonnet and British Ambassador to France Phipps held a meeting, the British and French governments have reached an agreement on the new instructions to be submitted to the British and French representatives in Moscow. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and British Special Envoy Strang will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Thursday.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 29th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet received US Ambassador Bullitt and British Ambassador Phipps on Wednesday afternoon. It is reported that the purpose of the US Ambassador's trip was to pay a courtesy call after suddenly returning from the United States, and to take the opportunity to provide a face-to-face account of the United States' diplomatic policy towards Europe. It is also reported from communication circles that the meeting between the French Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador was to discuss the British side's new proposal to Moscow. The contents of the proposal were communicated to the British Ambassador in Paris to inquire about the views held by the French Foreign Office and report them to the British government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Union's Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Smetanin, has been recalled to Moscow. The reason for this has not been announced, but foreign observers believe that his return to the country is to report on the situation in the Far East to the government and to receive the government's views on this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] Soviet parliamentarian Zhdanov published an article in "Pravda" today, stating that the negotiations for the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance pact are progressing slowly, and that Britain and France are really to blame, with Britain bearing even more responsibility. The Soviet Union has made various efforts to ensure the speedy realization of the mutual assistance pact, but so far there has been no significant progress. This is enough to show that Britain and France do not want to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union on the basis of equality. What they hope for is that after the Soviet Union concludes the treaty, it will shoulder all the obligations. They do not know that any self-respecting country will never be willing to be played with at will, or to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for others. The Soviet Union's power and solemnity have been universally known, and it is even less willing to agree to this kind of treaty.</p>
<h3>Complete Success of the Anglo-French Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 29th] Vice-Admiral D'Argenlieu, Commander-in-Chief of the French Naval Forces in the Far East, told a Reuters reporter today that the Anglo-French joint defense conference was a complete success. The Anglo-French Commanders-in-Chief in the Far East will meet regularly to discuss the situation.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>The Call from the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Today's news reports that the Party and government authorities, people's organizations, cultural organizations, and war zone political departments of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have jointly sent a telegram to both domestic and international audiences regarding the illegal blockade of the Tianjin Concession by Japanese forces. The telegram calls for international sanctions against Japan and expresses sympathy and support for compatriots trapped in the Concession. This is a movement that deserves enthusiastic response from all regions and sectors of the country. We, being overseas, should even more so feel obligated to use all our strength to urge friendly nations to jointly promote the aid-China and anti-Japanese movement. We should also call on overseas Chinese to unanimously launch a campaign to express sympathy for our compatriots trapped in Tianjin.</p>
<p>However, we must also clearly recognize that the current dire situation of our compatriots in the eastern provinces is particularly unbearable to imagine. This is partly due to Japan's intimidation of Britain, and partly due to Japan's eagerness to exploit the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of our occupied areas to "support the war." Therefore, from Shanghai, Dinghai, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou in the north, to Shantou and Chaozhou, there is again a state of extreme fear.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not only respond to the call from the eastern front, but also do our best to assist our soldiers and civilians on the eastern front—supporting their resistance against Japanese forces and the traitor Wang Jingwei, and opposing Wang Jingwei and his group's traitorous rhetoric of peace and anti-communism. We must be vigilant and aware that Japanese forces and Wang Jingwei are attempting to use this kind of activity, even coordinating with deceptive maneuvers such as the "withdrawal of Japanese troops from Guangzhou," to orchestrate political conspiracies and deceptions during the second anniversary of the "July 7th Incident." They aim to divide and split the unity of our nation, completely undermine our national policy of resistance and reconstruction, and shamelessly betray the Chinese nation, condemning our entire people to eternal slavery under Japanese forces!</p>
<h3>Situation in Danzig Suddenly Tense; Nazi Troops to Make Unusual Moves; Polish President Delivers Strong Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] It is reported that the Nazis in Danzig are rumored to be making military preparations. However, upon hearing this news, there are no signs of unrest here. Polish newspapers are all questioning whether the Nazis are about to launch an attack. There are many rumors circulating, but the general public's attitude can be summed up in the words "monitoring" and "vigilance."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] After learning of the news that German troops and armaments have arrived in Danzig, newspapers here fear that the Nazis will take action and warn Germany. They also believe that Britain and France will fulfill their obligations to Poland. "Le Figaro" reports that German troops will be instructors for the Danzig Free Corps, attempting to prevent any forward action by Poland and enabling German troops to invade the Vistula River. "L'Ordre" states, "If Hitler seizes Danzig and succeeds, he will become the overlord of Eastern Europe. Prime Minister Daladier's speech on Tuesday showed that he has no illusions, but Chamberlain continues to give speeches filled with doubt, encouraging Nazi actions, or even imagining a new Munich, which will be the death knell of Britain and France."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] Polish President Mościcki delivered a broadcast speech today, strongly asserting that the ports of Gdynia and Danzig are extremely important to Poland's national economy. "The connection between Danzig and Poland has lasted for thousands of years, and the reason lies in this." Gdynia and Danzig are both free ports, where merchants from all countries can freely conduct business.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 29th] A certain foreign expert on international affairs here stated that German leader Hitler has ordered the acceleration of agricultural harvesting in East Prussia, Czechia, and Moravia, in order to store more grain to cope with a possible crisis in mid-August. German troops continue to concentrate in eastern Moravia, and troop movements are carried out at night to avoid attention. The Polish border area is also preparing to build barracks sufficient to accommodate 100,000 soldiers.</p>
<h3>The Guarantee of World Peace</h3>
<p>— Shichang</p>
<p>It has been over four months since Britain, France, and the Soviet Union began negotiations, but the final agreement has been delayed. The crux of the problem is clearly the guarantee for the Baltic states. Other difficulties are not a problem. According to recent news, Britain has decided to make concessions again and is prepared to accept all of the Soviet Union's demands. Therefore, the establishment of an Anglo-Soviet agreement will surely be realized in the near future.</p>
<p>We should recognize that the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality, and are for the benefit of everyone. If the Baltic states were to be invaded, the security of the Soviet Union would be seriously threatened, and Britain would also feel uneasy. Moreover, if Britain and France do not approach the Soviet Union, hold negotiations, and establish an agreement, then the Nazi fleet could boldly sail into the Baltic Sea, invade the Soviet Union, and threaten Britain and France. However, after the establishment of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement, their combined strength will be strong enough to deal with any aggression, preventing aggressors from acting recklessly without any consideration. This is truly the guarantee of world peace.</p>
<p>We recognize that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are all peace-loving countries. The purpose of their mutual negotiations is not only to ensure their own security, but also for world peace, or more precisely, European peace. Therefore, it is clear that the main purpose of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement is to avoid war. Britain and France will not provoke war, which everyone acknowledges. The danger of war lies in Germany. If Hitler says again that he opposes war, it is somewhat true, because the Nazi Party hopes to promote a bloodless system of conquest. Wasn't the annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia very good?</p>
<p>Hitler loudly clamors that Germany must recover its old colonies, and he is even more ambitious for the area from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. However, to achieve this goal, there is no other good way except through war. Therefore, all of Germany's actions are based on war; the entire economy is based on a state of war readiness. Eighty percent of production is war materials and military supplies. Wages are low, the purchasing power of the people is reduced, and food imports are replaced by war materials. Everything is centered on war, sacrificing bread for cannons. Germany's situation has reached an extremely dangerous point.</p>
<p>All countries are familiar with Germany's situation. Hitler and the like are not unaware of the crisis in their own country. However, they still have a glimmer of hope, which is to wait for a good opportunity to fight a battle. Other than this, there is no good way to save the country from its misfortune.</p>
<p>This is the current state of crisis in Europe. Germany urgently needs to seek external development, while the democratic bloc must prevent the imminent acts of aggression. Of course, the future trend is mysterious and unpredictable, and no one can accurately predict it. However, finding the direction to achieve peace is not very difficult. The importance of the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance lies in this. Before launching an aggression, Germany must consider that Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, Poland, and Turkey will be in a hostile position with Germany. Moreover, Italy's cool attitude and the neutrality of the Balkan countries are all unfavorable to Germany. However, if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union fail to reach an agreement, everything will be very different. At that time, the Nazi leaders will surely mobilize quickly and launch a surprise attack on neighboring small countries, the consequences of which would be disastrous.</p>
<p>The current international situation is maintained under tense circumstances. Those who care about peace are all showing worry on their faces. However, the manipulators of the overall situation and the decision-makers of war and peace are still in London and Moscow. Undoubtedly, the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement will be the guarantee of world peace.</p>

<h3>University Education</h3>
<p>Is University Worth Attending?</p>
<p>To study the value of modern university education, the Harvard University class of 1911 is a good source of information. Our class was made up of very ordinary students, with no particularly good academic records, no nationally renowned athletes, and no outstanding thinkers. College students in the United States represent only 5 percent of the total population, and we are among the fortunate few to receive so-called higher education in the world. Now, let us study how we have used this opportunity for higher education.</p>
<p>In our class, there are truly many talents: a former commander of the American Legion, a vagrant who hasn't slept in a bed for five years, the owner of a gas station, a former director of the New York Stock Exchange, a machinist, a radio broadcaster, a senior official of the League of Nations, a university president, a railway postal worker, a lunch wagon renter, and a member of the Harvard Club in Sing Sing Prison. In addition, there are many more.</p>
<p>In our class, 50 percent of us admit that our current occupation is not what we originally hoped to do when we graduated from university. Some of us have changed jobs five or six times and are still looking for new ones. Only 5 percent have stuck to one occupation from graduation to the present.</p>
<p>In our class, I also discovered several surprising facts. Twenty-five years after graduating from university, one-eighth of our classmates are receiving government relief or are relying on their families for support. Some classmates can't even spell the president's name. Twenty-five years after leaving university life, the average income of our entire class is $4,500 per person per year. In the eyes of those of us who have received a university education and have been in society for a quarter of a century, this number is certainly not a lot.</p>
<p>After investigating these 541 people in detail, I feel that a university education does not guarantee a stable life. Some classmates who married wealthy women have invested their money wildly and spent it all. Some classmates let their fathers-in-law invest, and they also failed. Many classmates stuck to one occupation and suffered the effects of the economic downturn. On the other hand, there was a poor kid who worked his way through college and only knew a dozen or so classmates. Now, he is the big boss of a chain of cigar companies. The kid who made money answering phones at the stock exchange at night and came to school during the day, not knowing when he slept, is now one of America's great scientists. The classmate who joined every club in school and shook hands with people all day long recently paid $2,645 in income tax.</p>
<p>So, what special benefits did the four years of so-called university education bring us? There are many people in the world who have never attended university, but they have also accomplished great things and done things that have benefited mankind. From the perspective of some people in our class, a university education is undoubtedly valuable. But to sell stocks, sell securities, do insurance business, sell real estate, be an investment consultant, or be an interior decorator, there is no need to receive a university education.</p>
<p>Universities have always been regarded as a beacon of wisdom. But now, this beacon of wisdom has produced such a group of citizens. If you send your son to university because you want him to socialize with the children of the wealthy or hope that he will earn a lot of money in the future, then you should think again about whether you are wasting his time and your money.</p>
<p>Finally, I must state that this is talking about the United States. Whether it is the same in China is unknown.</p>
<h3>One Person Per Day</h3>
<p>Han Yu, a great master of Chinese studies, was most afraid of monks and Taoists talking nonsense, believing them to be "demons that would destroy the country." His door was always posted with "No monks or Taoists allowed," and he never gave them a single hair.</p>
<p>The high-ranking monks in the capital often suffered his anger and hated him to the core.</p>
<p>Once, they found a handle and went to see Master Han, asking:</p>
<p>"Since you despise Buddhism and Taoism so much, why is your young son's nickname 'Monk Brother'?"</p>
<p>"That's too simple," Old Han said solemnly. "Haven't you heard that Wang Laoer, the night watchman, calls his son 'Doggy,' and Li San, the vegetable seller, calls his son 'Kitty'? My son is called 'Lunge,' which is the same meaning."</p>
<h3>Plan</h3>
<p>Not long ago, an American women's magazine solicited the opinions of domestic women on the topic of "The Ten Most Important Things That Modern Women Think Are Important." The following are the results obtained by the magazine, ranked in order of importance, with the most important ranked at the top:</p>
<p>(1) Beauty</p>
<p>(2) Emotion and Love</p>
<p>(3) Economic Stability</p>
<p>(4) Youth</p>
<p>(5) Health</p>
<p>(6) Children</p>
<p>(7) Fashion</p>
<p>(8) Family</p>
<p>(9) The Surrounding World</p>
<p>(10) Entertainment</p>
<h3>Rain Flower</h3>
<p>Officer: How is your health?</p>
<p>Recruit: I don't understand.</p>
<p>Officer: Nonsense, don't you understand your own health?</p>
<p>Recruit: Because my body has been dedicated to the country, it is not my own body.</p>
<p>Lawyer: It would be good if you could prove that you were not at the scene when the theft occurred. At that time, did anyone see you anywhere?</p>
<p>Defendant: No. Fortunately, no one saw me, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to do it.</p>
<p>Metropolitan woman visiting a pasture: Oh, that cow keeps looking at me.</p>
<p>Guide: That's because you're wearing red.</p>
<p>Woman: The hateful thing, does it know in the countryside that this dress is not fashionable this year?</p>
<p>A: I can't fall asleep if I drink coffee.</p>
<p>B: I'm the opposite. Once I fall asleep, I won't drink coffee.</p>
<h3>Weather Station</h3>
<p>What is it called? In Hanoi, one is attacked and expelled; in Shanghai, one cannot live; in Nanjing, no one cares; in Beijing, there is unanimous opposition: What is this called? A burial ground.</p>
<p>We are very fortunate that the British Empire is indeed a country with democratic politics. This time, we have seen it even more clearly. Every day, the House of Lords speaks, the House of Commons discusses, you question, I criticize, strong, strong! Public opinion is expressed with great enthusiasm. !</p>
<p>, Stripped naked, is not insulting; the Japanese say. John Bull says: Let's discuss it, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong news item. A faithful report: "The Hong Kong and Kowloon Tour Guide Industry held a charity fundraising meeting for the 'July 7th' memorial at the Ko Shing Tea House yesterday. Seventy-two tour guide agencies from Hong Kong and Kowloon attended, with representatives reaching one hundred people. After the meeting, the chairman gave an opening speech, saying that all Hong Kong organizations are preparing to commemorate 'July 7th', each fulfilling the responsibility of a citizen. Therefore, the Hong Kong and Kowloon tour guide industry will also conduct a charity tour on 'July 7th' for one day and one night, and all proceeds will be allocated, with one-tenth to be used to console the family of the martyred Chinese detective Yin Wen, and the remaining nine-tenths to be sent to the central government to strengthen the forces." Long live patriotism!</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>There was a fellow who liked to write articles, but his writing style was poor. Every time he wrote an article, he would use "Alas" a lot. Often, the text was less than two hundred words, but there were already seven or eight "Alas." Once, his friend added a long comment behind one of his favorite masterpieces, which was full of "Alas":</p>
<p>Beginning with "Alas," ending with "Alas," in the middle, everything is "Alas." Long "Alas," short "Alas," saying it over and over again, it's always "Alas." "Alas" and "Alas," "Alas" and again "Alas," I'm afraid you'll soon be "Alas"!</p>
<h3>A Small Question</h3>
<p>There is a piano in the living room, and a parrot on the piano. John is playing the piano, and Tom is singing and walking around the piano. When the parrot sees Tom turning, it also turns. Tom turned five times and stopped, and the parrot also stopped.</p>
<p>Now, please answer: How many times did Tom turn around the piano? How many times did Tom turn around John? How many times did Tom turn around the parrot? How many times did the parrot turn around the piano? How many times did the parrot turn around John? How many times did the parrot turn around Tom?</p>
<h3>Sea Storm</h3>
<p>— By Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>The previous text excerpted from 1914</p>
<p>In the autumn of that year, Jack, the radio operator of the Cox shipping company, and Bill, the mechanic, took the German ship "Kaiser Wilhelm II" to travel to Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war, and British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then fled madly. Soon, they encountered icebergs and British warships' shelling. With great difficulty, they escaped the tiger's mouth and returned to White Sea, America. Jack and Bill then returned to New York to see Mr. Cox. Cox then asked them to go to Europe to find his son...</p>
<p>"Exchange them for cash and take them with you," he handed over the checks, "If these are used up, Lee House and Harding in London are my agents, you can find them for anything you need. Also, this time, do you want to bring anyone with you?"</p>
<p>"Sir, I was also preparing to say that this kind of hard work, Bill Nanuo—"</p>
<p>"Him, I know, that lanky kid. Not bad, but is he willing to go with you?"</p>
<p>"I think he will be willing."</p>
<p>9 Remembers the Account Again</p>
<p>This kind of errand, as Jack himself said, was almost impossible to succeed. However, Jack was still childish enough, and he was quite happy to take this opportunity to tour wartime Europe. As for Bill Nanuo, he was somewhat addicted to being stimulated.</p>
<p>The 'Saint Mark' was a very famous ship, and in the past, she was often fully booked when she sailed out. However, this time, there were very few first-class passengers, and second-class passengers were as sparse as the morning stars. As for the lower class, there were fewer than one hundred people, most of whom were going back to Europe to enlist in their home countries.</p>
<p>When they sailed out of the harbor, the two sides were lined with ships of all sizes, from small freighters to large liners with four smokestacks, all docked there. Before the war, they traveled between Torkinsville, Statesville, Florida, and other places for business, but now, everything seems paralyzed and stagnant. The United States is a neutral country, and it is her responsibility to inspect outgoing ships and prevent them from carrying wartime contraband, especially those flying the flags of belligerent countries.</p>
<p>After being questioned by a young junior officer, the "Saint Mark" lowered its flag and sailed out of the harbor.</p>
<p>"Okay, Jack," Bill Nanuo said, at this time, Jack had just finished sending a few farewell and business letters for the ship, "We're on the road again."</p>
<p>"That's true, and this time, thank goodness, we're under the American flag, which is really good luck these days."</p>
<p>"That's true, but do you have any idea which port the ship will dock at?"</p>
<p>"It's still unknown, we have to wait for telegrams from the New York or London companies to decide."</p>
<p>"The position we're holding now is really a novel one, Jack,"</p>
<p>"Isn't it? I hope it goes smoothly. In any case, it's an opportunity for us to see the situation during the war."</p>
<p>"That's a great opportunity, but as for finding Tom Cox, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack, it's really not easy."</p>
<p>A large man, with a black beard, walked into the radio room, holding a letter he had already written.</p>

<h3>The Passing and Throwing of Water Polo – Lecture</h3>
<p>— Pan Congshao</p>
<p>In order to throw the ball far, with great force, or to throw it high, strong arm strength must be used. The higher the upper body rises out of the water, the greater the force of the arm swing and the waist. When throwing the ball with one hand, the other hand should extend sideways in the water to assist the arm's power, and at the same time, apply a slight downward pressure to help the body float. It is important to note that this hand in the water should be able to produce a floating-body assisting action.</p>
<p>Floating the body is a skill that throwers must practice diligently for flexible use. In water polo passing, receivers must also have high swimming skills for floating in the water. As for its importance in ball-grabbing, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Possessing the ability of freestyle swimming, knowing how to hold and throw the ball, and passing water polo, it is possible to practice the entire water polo sport. Here are a few key points for shooting at the goal for the reference of those who are learning.</p>
<p>From a water polo strategic perspective, how to arrange formations for advancing and the art of scoring require quick and unexpected techniques. Daily shooting practice should focus on the basic techniques of throwing. The water polo goal is not very wide, and if the goalkeeper has the talent to jump high out of the water, it is not easy to throw the ball into the net. Therefore, scorers must:</p>
<p>First, the throwing power must be fierce and the action quick. Because the competition area is not wide, shooters often approach the goal before throwing, making the goalkeeper intimidated. And because the action is quick, even if the goalkeeper is calm, they may not be able to react in time due to the suddenness of the attack.</p>
<p>Second, the direction of the throw must not be obvious. Because throwing occurs close to the goal, the direction of the throw can be easily observed. Therefore, the gesture of releasing the ball should appear as if still in the preparatory throwing motion, so that the goalkeeper does not have the chance to observe and react.</p>
<p>Both of these points are feared by goalkeepers. Apply one's strengths to exploit the opponent's weaknesses that cannot be overcome. Acquiring these basic movements is of great value. (End)</p>
<h3>"Two-Ton Giant" Loses to "Black Boxing King": Galento Fails in the Fourth Round</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 29th] The world heavyweight boxing champion, "Black Boxing King" Joe Louis, fought "Two-Ton Giant" Galento last night at Yankee Stadium. In the first round, Galento attacked fiercely, acting cautiously, with powerful left and right punches. Joe Louis also retaliated with powerful blows. Galento won this round. In the second round, Galento landed a strong left punch, but was also hit by Joe Louis, causing his nose to bleed. Then, Galento powerfully struck Joe Louis, knocking him down, but Joe Rose immediately jumped up and landed many powerful punches, very successfully. Galento appeared to have difficulty defending. Joe Louis won this round. In the third and fourth rounds, Galento continued to try to win, launching fierce attacks, but Joe Louis launched a series of fierce attacks, causing him to lose his balance. He grabbed the referee's arm, his face covered in blood. The referee then announced the termination of the continuation of the match. In total, they fought for four rounds, lasting two minutes and thirty-nine seconds. Joe Louis retained his "Boxing King throne."</p>

<h3>Tai Chi Style Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Qianli</p>
<p>Peace, peace, turning big matters into small matters, and small matters into nothing. This is the policy adopted by "Peace Angel" Mr. Zhang Bolun since he took office. However, sometimes, when forced by those unreasonable and reckless barbarians, "Peace Angel" Zhang has no choice but to temporarily put down the slogan of peace and talk about his strength. He said, "Look, our British navy is the strongest, our British air force is the best in the world, and the power of our tanks and cannons is unmatched by anyone. We are not afraid of anyone, and we are 'not afraid of war'. If you continue to be reckless and overconfident, then you will regret it..."</p>
<p>Sometimes, these words have some effect, so Mr. Zhang takes advantage of the situation to bring those disputes to a compromise ending. But sometimes, when encountering even stronger barbarians, they see that Mr. Zhang, holding a peace umbrella, is not really a god of war, and the umbrella cannot replace guns and swords, so they ignore him and continue to be reckless. At this time, Mr. Chamberlain's situation is indeed a bit difficult, but he also has a way, which is to contact all parties, asking everyone to endure, concede, sacrifice, and prevent the event from escalating, holding on to "peace."</p>
<p>Using this method, he produced the "non-interference policy" towards Spain and the "Munich Conference" towards Czechoslovakia, preserving the "peace" of the world!</p>
<p>Our Mr. Wu saw that Mr. Chamberlain's diplomatic policy was very skillful and infinitely varied, so he called Mr. Zhang's policy "playing Tai Chi," saying that it was "hard in the soft, soft in the hard, using gentleness to overcome strength, a clever strategy that makes the opponent unable to deploy." He told people not to underestimate this old man.</p>
<p>As far as I know, probably no one would dare to underestimate this skillful and sophisticated diplomatic strategy. Unfortunately, those reckless barbarians do not understand the advantages and disadvantages of Mr. Zhang's "Tai Chi policy" and continue to be reckless. So as a result, Spain was sacrificed, Czechoslovakia was also sacrificed, and Austria and Albania were sacrificed one after another. In addition, Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania... are also in imminent danger of being sacrificed.</p>
<p>In the Far East, China itself has been sacrificed in large part, and the interests of the great powers in China have perhaps been sacrificed even more. The market in Manchuria has been completely occupied by the Japanese barbarians, and the foreign markets in North China and Central China have been almost completely excluded. The few remaining concessions are also in turmoil. The police power in Gulangyu is being wantonly trampled upon and blockaded, the Shanghai Municipal Council is repeatedly threatened, British ships are repeatedly bombed, and British diplomats are constantly being insulted and kidnapped. All of this is the fine fruit of Mr. Chamberlain's "peace diplomacy" in dealing with the powerful.</p>
<p>Now, in the Tianjin incident, the opponent's reckless methods seem to be even more thorough. The Japanese devils not only confine the citizens of the great British Empire within the electrified concession, cutting off the supply of vegetables and meat, but also play all sorts of tricks, such as forcing British expatriates to strip naked in broad daylight for intrusive searches, even the genitals and hair cannot be spared, and even further demanding that Ms. Duan Tesheng, a British expatriate, take off her pants in public. Such extreme treatment is probably rare even in conquered countries. However, Mr. Chamberlain seems not to care. In addition to firmly stating that "the serious stage of retaliation has not yet been reached," he has also sent Ambassador Craigie to Japan to visit Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, asking him to have mercy and stop the Japanese actions. This is probably the method of using gentleness to overcome strength in the Tai Chi diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>However, can this Tai Chi style diplomacy achieve results, causing the Japanese to finally see the light and be merciful, and ultimately be overcome by gentleness? Or will it only "encourage the Japanese to continue their atrocities"? From the evidence of the facts, it seems to belong to the latter. Did we not see the Japanese troops landing in Gulangyu withdraw because of the same actions of the British, American, and French? Isn't the supply of meat and vegetables in the Tianjin concession only able to pass through because of the protection of British troops?</p>
<p>Why doesn't Japan immediately occupy the British concession in Tianjin? It is not because Mr. Zhang's Tai Chi style diplomacy makes them fear, but because there are many British cannons inside the concession and at the harbor. If they eat this piece of meat and inevitably have to sacrifice, that is not what they want to do. Now that the situation is so serious and urgent, if Mr. Zhang is still only talking about "peace" and only evacuating expatriates and waiting for the Japanese to repent, then the long night will be dark, and there will be many nightmares. I am afraid that not only will the British concession in Tianjin soon become a completely dead market, but also Hong Kong and Singapore may not be able to sleep peacefully.</p>
<h3>To the Nameless Heroes</h3>
<p>— Shiguang</p>
<p>Friends: I am the most afraid of loneliness and calmness. To me, loneliness and calmness are like a pitch-black night without lights, stars, or moon, being in an abyss of ten thousand feet, having to crawl through tunnels of tens of thousands, which makes me shudder.</p>
<p>Before the war, I had many friends who understood and sympathized with each other. We often gathered together, mostly talking about the world situation and the international situation. The friends were also generous, forthright, enthusiastic, hardworking, and responsible, even surpassing ordinary men. However, not long after the war, two disappeared, having been missing for nearly two years; one sacrificed, and she sacrificed on this day last year!</p>
<p>Only I remain alone on this devilish island, living the life of a weak writer. Everything has become my memory. But I am not depressed: You, martyrs, died gloriously, but you have achieved your own aspirations, and your great spirit will always exist.</p>
<p>Ah, friend, regret; another message came, and I almost couldn't believe my ears, you sacrificed yourself for the country again. Really, you died. I laugh, I laugh at your seeking benevolence and gaining benevolence. A overseas Chinese who grew up overseas sacrificed himself in the embrace of the war-torn motherland, wandered from the United States to China, and stained the battlefield with blood. How great that is!</p>
<p>You were a young man full of vigor. In the team, you took on responsibilities even more diligently. In less than a month of joining the army, you held four positions at once. You took the lead in charging on the front line, you trained the brothers, you composed popular songs for the people to sing, and you also managed the wall newspaper.</p>
<p>I still remember: "The environment is like this, but I have to transform the environment and fight against it!" You said.</p>
<p>"Friend, I hope you move forward bravely. That's right, we have to create the environment!" When I heard you talk about a certain special situation in that place, I always advised you like this. When we first met, you gave us a deep impression. We got to know each other like this, but there was no more opportunity to have a long conversation all day long, because everyone was busy: You were firm and mature, extremely alert. When encountering a difficult matter, two are often deeply black. You sympathized with all the oppressed people in the world, and even went to work as a dock worker and as a worker in a factory. Children like you are still a minority among those born in bourgeois families!</p>
<p>From now on, may you rest peacefully in the warm soil of your motherland. Your white bones and bright red flesh and blood are all fertilizer for the new China that is growing up. In the near future, even more beautiful buds will grow on this land.</p>
<p>Ah! Great and glorious dead, nameless heroes who will always live in our hearts, when will I bring a bouquet of flowers to the solemn he dedication before the opening ceremony in front of you</p>
<h3>Hurled Themselves Towards the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>— The Story of a Girl —</p>
<p>Jingwen tilted her head and said angrily.</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true, but there are more procedures."</p>
<p>"But—" Jingwen's face turned to Qingzhi, "Why can those first-class passengers go up?"</p>
<p>"Who knows? Anyway, small societies and large societies are all the same. There's no way to jump out!"</p>
<p>They helplessly walked back to the cabin, closed the door, and went to sleep on the bed. They couldn't hear the sound of the ship moving. On the contrary, they felt a bit lonely. When they opened the cabin door, the noisy voices made people feel upset.</p>
<p>"No matter what, we should cheer up a bit, because we are back in the arms of the motherland."</p>
<p>Jing opened her mouth as if explaining to herself.</p>
<p>"The road is always walked step by step. First, we will come out of the clutches of the × people, and gradually we will be able to go to the place we want to go. Good, those houses are really interesting, they are simply stacked there like small toys. Look, that electric army is so small, the people are so small..."</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Call from the Mainland</h3>
<p>— Lunzi</p>
<p>Come on, friends! If you don't plan to come, you must come; if you plan to come but want to come later, come sooner</p>
<p>I know you are dissatisfied on the isolated island. Some of you are studying, but you are not settled, because Shanghai is not a place to study at all, and it is even worse now. Some of you are doing some small things, reluctantly working in a job that can make a living, but you feel bored, thinking that working like this is too meaningless. Some of you are wandering around, or you are overwhelmed by life and feel unbearably boring. You all want to live more satisfactorily and happily.</p>
<p>Then, strangely, why don't you come to the mainland? The mainland has freedom, you can do whatever you want. The mainland has vigor, which can make a decadent person strive. The mainland is full of meaningful work. The strong can shoulder guns, those with eloquence can propagandize, and those with specialized skills can be used appropriately. The mainland not only has no worries about life, but is also richer in the feeling of real life. Why don't you come?</p>
<p>You must come, and come sooner! You know, our pain is gradually passing; our light is right in front of us; all our great goals will be achieved. Are you unwilling to come and greet such an era? Are you unwilling to participate in the realization of this era? If you are lingering on the isolated island, if you are not intending to wait to be a subjugated slave, are you intending to stand by now and then sit back and enjoy the success in the future? Do you have no ambition? No ambition?</p>
<p>Of course, you also have various difficulties that prevent you from escaping. But have you forgotten the immortal maxim, "Those who have ambition will succeed"? As long as you have the will, I believe that your family burdens can be resolved; as long as you are willing to ask others, you can definitely find a suitable path.</p>
<p>Please temporarily close your physical ears and eyes, and listen with your spiritual ears. We are calling you. Please come and join the wedding feast that will be held soon; look with your spiritual eyes. We are waving to you. Please come and join us in repelling the invaders, and then build our new China together!</p>
<p>Come on, friends on the isolated island!</p>
<p>Nameless Soldier</p>
<h3>Ancient City</h3>
<p>— Li Qu</p>
<p>— Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou —</p>
<p>They said it was only twenty li to the ancient city, but I didn't expect that we didn't arrive at this distant campsite until dusk.</p>
<p>Dragging my aching feet, I stepped into the ancient city shrouded in twilight, surrounded by green trees, which seemed so quiet and secluded. A touch of leisurely thought suddenly floated in my heart: Is this the ancient city that Zhang Yide guarded? I remember when I was a child, I saw the picture in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. When Guan Yunchang beheaded Cai Yang, Zhang Yide was still squatting on the city tower of the ancient city, beating the drum to cheer. Could General Zhang, with his tall stature, squat down on the low fence gate tower that I just stepped over? — Maybe this city gate is not the same city gate as before, but is this city really the ancient city that Zhang Yide guarded? Please let the archaeologists examine it!</p>
<p>This city is just a market town with about two to three hundred households, under the jurisdiction of Bozhou. It seems to be quite lively on weekdays, but it has now been visited by brutal planes several times, and the people have been bombed and run away. The city is full of frightening desolation. The houses on both sides of the street are completely closed. Even the dogs don't know where they have escaped with their owners. There is not even a welcoming bark. In the thin night, only a few bats are flapping their black wings, flying back and forth quickly, as if they are playing games for the children.</p>
<p>We found a large empty house without any covering, and lay down.</p>
<p>"Order!" someone knocked on the door outside.</p>
<p>I opened the door, and a messenger walked in:</p>
<p>"The commander's order: Comrade Yang is asked to go to Bozhou to scout as soon as possible. Have the teams we were separated from on the road arrived in Bozhou? We must quickly get in touch with them..."</p>
<p>The messenger walked out, and Comrade Yang, who was lying on the bed, jumped off the bed and scratched his head:</p>
<p>"How can I go in this dark night? I haven't been to Bozhou before..."</p>
<p>At that time, Bozhou was at war; but can I not go?</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, Comrade Yang changed into an old peasant's clothes and went out with an unguided man.</p>
<p>Not long after the people in the house fell asleep, another order came:</p>
<p>— Depart at four o'clock tonight, destination Qiuchu Village...</p>
<p>Before dawn, a mixed crowd of people and horses came out of each room. The sound of horses' hooves, the collision of canteens and bayonets, and the turbid footsteps... mixed together, echoing in the ancient city that was still sleeping. The dead ancient city seemed to come alive again!</p>

<h3>Special Gazette Issued: Ferry Engine to be Quarantined; Passengers Must Submit Certificates and Undergo Inspection Before Departure; Governor Has the Power to Promulgate Special Cases to Suppress Epidemics</h3>
<p>Cholera is prevalent in Hong Kong. The government authorities have already taken active measures to prevent it. In order to prevent external infections, strict precautions have been taken for passengers on Hong Kong-Macau ships. Yesterday, the government's special gazette again promulgated regulations on ship quarantine. These regulations stipulate that aircraft and ships traveling from Hong Kong to Macau must first undergo inspection before being allowed to depart. These regulations are listed in the 1936 Sea Ban and Disease Prevention Ordinance. The Governor-in-Council and the Legislative Council have the power to issue various special cases to suppress it in the event of smallpox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, and intestinal epidemic. The notice stated that all ships traveling to Hong Kong and Macau require passengers and sailors to be injected by health officials, and must submit certificates proving that they have recently been vaccinated and injected to prevent cholera and other infectious diseases. Anyone found to be suffering from an infectious disease or who has been in close contact with someone who has been infected must leave the ship immediately. The injection certificate must prove the date of the injector, which must be six days before and not more than half a year old, and must have a photo of the certificate holder, and be valid only after being printed by the government and signed by the Health Bureau. The ban to be implemented is recorded below.</p>
<p>(All aircraft or ships sailing from Hong Kong to Macau must be subject to the following regulations, unless specially exempted by the Director of Medical Services). (1) The parts of the ship or aircraft that are particularly susceptible to contamination must be hygienically cleaned. (2) Passengers and crew must first be inspected by a health official and must submit recent vaccination and immunization certificates. (3) Anyone found to be suffering from an infectious disease listed in Article 2 of the regulations, or who is in close contact with a patient and may be infected, the health official has the right to order him to leave the ship or aircraft. (4) The ship and aircraft are where there is dirt. The health official has the right to remove it. (5) When the plague is prevalent, the government implements the ban. The health official suspects that rats have been found on the ship or aircraft and can order rat extermination. (6) If enteritis is prevalent and the government has to implement the ban, no matter who or other items, the health officer has the right to order its disinfection after inspection.</p>
<h3>Air Force Technicians Arrive from England One After Another: Two Batches of Seventy Men are Transferred to Hong Kong; Local Chinese Air Force Personnel to be Recruited in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>In light of the increasingly precarious situation in the Far East, the Hong Kong military authorities are taking proactive measures to strengthen defenses in all three areas – sea, land, and air. Particular attention is being paid to air defense, as warfare today is three-dimensional. Should an emergency arise, there will be no distinction between front lines and rear areas, and there is a risk of being threatened at any time. Therefore, preparations for air defense are being pursued more actively than other areas. In addition to intensifying the training and organization of the public in air defense knowledge and skills, increasing the strength of the air force is also urgently needed.</p>
<p>Two Batches of Air Force Personnel Arrive in Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to air force sources yesterday, the Royal Air Force station in Hong Kong has completed the magnificent Kam Tin Airport. Together with the existing Kai Tak Royal Air Force station, there is sufficient capacity to house a large air force. The British Air Force High Command has decided to dispatch air force technical personnel to be stationed here. They are arriving in batches. The first batch of 25 men arrived last month, and the second batch of 45 men arrived in Hong Kong yesterday by transport. This second batch of more than 40 men includes pilots, mechanics, bombardiers, and other specialized technical personnel, all of whom are outstanding members of the air force. The air force technical personnel that England has decided to transfer to Hong Kong will continue to arrive in Hong Kong in the near future.</p>
<p>Planning to Recruit Local Chinese Personnel</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to replenish the number of air force personnel to meet urgent needs, the air force authorities are considering a plan to recruit a certain number of local Chinese air force personnel, similar to the methods used in the army and navy. These personnel will be responsible for all heavy work related to the air force, facilitating swift action in emergencies, just like the current local Chinese artillerymen and engineers in the army. The air force authorities have already completed the planning for this matter and submitted it to the British Air Force Ministry for approval. Once approved, recruitment of these local Chinese volunteer air force personnel will commence to meet the needs. As for the organization of the Air Force Volunteer Corps, the air force authorities believe that since it has already been implemented in other overseas territories of the British Empire, it is also necessary to establish it in Hong Kong as soon as possible. Therefore, based on the organizational methods of the Army Volunteer Corps, a complete organizational outline has been drafted and submitted to the British military department for review. Approval is expected soon, and all preparations will then begin, it is said.</p>

<h3>New Record: 120 Vehicle Accidents Last Week</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Police Traffic Department, in the week ending at 8:00 PM last Saturday, a total of 120 traffic accidents occurred in Hong Kong, an average of 17 accidents per day, setting a new historical record for Hong Kong. There were 69 injuries and two deaths. Among the types of vehicles involved in the accidents, private cars were the most numerous, accounting for 58, followed by buses with 31, trucks with 26, and 22 combined for single and three-wheeled vehicles. Trams accounted for 14, carts for 7, and motorcycles for 5.</p>
<h3>Survey of Air Defense Personnel in Various Districts: No One in Section A of Central District Passed the Exam; Few Applicants Since the Start of the Second Class</h3>
<p>To ensure that the general public has a widespread understanding of air defense knowledge, the Hong Kong air defense authorities have established air defense training classes in various districts of Hong Kong. These classes teach residents of each district various types of knowledge about avoiding air raids, so that they can protect themselves and others, and serve the local area in times of emergency. Air defense classes have been established in various districts for some time. Recently, to understand the number of people who have passed the air defense exam in each district, so that they can be easily assigned to service work in times of emergency, the authorities have sent letters to the heads of each district, instructing them to report the detailed numbers. Liu Jingqing, the head of the Central District Section A Air Defense Training Class, received the letter and, after investigation, replied to the air defense authorities yesterday, stating: "This district has been thoroughly investigated, but as of now, no one has passed the exam. It is found that there are about 1,200 shops and more than 4,000 floors of buildings under the jurisdiction of this district. Moreover, this district is a commercial hub with a relatively large number of intellectuals. Yet, among the residents of the entire district, no one holds a certificate as a trainer or paramedic. The reasons for this can be divided into the following three points: (1) Businesses in this district may be too busy with their commercial affairs and therefore do not pay attention to sending people to learn. (2) They believe that practicing air defense knowledge is just working for others and hold a negative view, thinking that even if an air raid occurs, government personnel will provide guidance, so they do not send people to learn. (3) At the same time, they believe that sending shop assistants to learn air defense means one less person in the shop, indirectly affecting business. It is hoped that the businesses and residents in this district will promptly abandon the above three negative views, as practicing air defense is not primarily for protecting others, but for protecting oneself first," etc. According to reports, the air defense class opened in the Central District section of Central District last month had a total of 191 trainees, but only about 30 of them were from that district, with the rest coming from other districts. Moreover, since the start of the second class, almost a month has passed, and only a few people have applied for training. The head of the district hopes that the businesses in the district will promptly send personnel to participate. If the number of applicants still does not reach 50 within this ten-day period, it may be necessary to cancel the class and reorganize it. As for the business people in other districts who are inconvenienced in learning air defense, there are many inconveniences, it is said.</p>

<h3>Ling Ying Middle School Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday: British Guest's Speech Was Very Insightful; Expressed Great Confidence in China's Future in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Ling Ying Middle School in Hong Kong held its middle school graduation ceremony, as well as graduation ceremonies for the attached elementary school and kindergarten, at the school at 9:00 AM yesterday. Several hundred people attended, including parents and all the school's teachers and students. After the ceremony proceeded as usual, the school's principal, Hong Gaohuang, gave an opening speech. Then, a British guest, Mr. Luo Dale, delivered a speech. The speech was delivered in fluent Mandarin and was very moving. Principal Hong translated the gist into Cantonese, saying that today's crisis in China is a crisis for the world, a crisis for the youth, and also a crisis for the individual. The rapid progress of construction in southwestern and northwestern China, and especially the spirit of unity and hard work, are enough to guarantee that victory will belong to China. China is now opening the back door of the northwest as an international gate, making transportation extremely convenient. The spirit of the youth at the Anti-Japanese University is especially admirable. Young people working hard to serve society will surely become great figures, etc. Then, Provincial Assemblyman Jin Zengcheng gave a speech. After the principal awarded graduation certificates and prizes, elementary school student Bei Jianming gave a speech in Mandarin, which was quite innocent and lively. Entertainment was provided and the school's silver band, led by Lin Shengweng, played music, ending the event with joy. It is reported that the school had 30 graduates from middle school, 26 from elementary school, and 11 from kindergarten this year.</p>

<h3>Legislative Council Meeting Yesterday: Announcement of Air Defense Expenditure; Extension of Banks' Right to Issue Banknotes Passed; Postmaster Authorized to Search Residences at Any Time</h3>
<p>The Legislative Council held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Those present included: Sir Geoffry Alexander Stafford Northcote (Chairman), Commander of the Army Major-General A.E. Grasett (representing A.S. McKerron), Colonial Secretary N.L. Smith, Financial Secretary G.G. Gimson, Secretary for Chinese Affairs R.A.C. North, Commissioner of Police E.I. Barreto, Director of Medical and Sanitary Services S.Y. King, Director of Marine J.O. Thomson, Director of Public Works A. Inglis, and Unofficial Members Sir Shouson Chow, T.N. Chau, R.H. Kotewall, James Paterson, L. D'Almada Remedios, and Lo Man Kam. After opening the meeting, the Colonial Secretary first announced the situation regarding air defense actions and expenditures, stating that when the budget was discussed last year, the air defense item was only a rough estimate, as the air defense plan was still under consideration. After research, the outline of the air defense plan was decided, and the implementation steps included the installation of air defense chambers and sandbags in various agencies, the addition of firefighting tools, gas masks, clothing, and medicines, as well as the preparation of subsidies for the construction costs of air defense chambers for private factories and companies, and the formulation of a air raid shelter excavation plan. The decision was made not to proceed with the construction of large tunnels and basements, as it would be difficult for citizens to rush to the tunnels from crowded areas within a few minutes after the alarm was issued, and there was fear that the existence of tunnels would cause citizens to neglect indoor air defense construction. Regarding the issue of defense against poisonous gas, a plan has been drafted to establish an organization to operate the sale of gas masks at cost, and the government will provide free custody. As for the detailed methods, they will be announced in the future. The implementation of the air defense plan requires expenditure exceeding the 1939 budget. In addition to the expenditure of the Air Defense Department, the various air defense units need $250,000, and public construction will require $200,000. The air defense expenditure for this year exceeds $1.5 million, and that number will be submitted to the Finance Committee for discussion and approval, it was said.</p>
<p>After the Colonial Secretary finished the announcement, Unofficial Member Sir Shouson Chow raised the following questions: "Have the rates for 1939 to 1940 been assessed? If the assessment is complete, please announce the new figures." The Colonial Secretary, representing the government, replied that the new assessed rates for each district in Hong Kong and the comparative figures for the rates for 1938 to 1939 are as follows:</p>
<p>Region Assessed Value for 1938-1939 Assessed Value for 1939-1940</p>
<p>Victoria City 21,346,621 24,657,053</p>
<p>Hong Kong Rural Area 3,828,927 4,279,463</p>
<p>Kowloon 81,181,336 100,857,840</p>
<p>New Kowloon 2,208,738 2,282,9772</p>
<p>Statistics 35,502,622 41,915,072</p>
<p>Financial Secretary G.G. Gimson proposed the following resolution regarding pensions for widows and orphans: "The resolution regarding the provisions for widows and orphans' pensions passed by this council on June 1, 1938, is hereby repealed in its entirety and replaced by the following provision: 'The resolution passed by this council on August 2, 1902, regarding the exchange rate for widows and orphans' pensions paid in London at three shillings per dollar shall not apply to those receiving pensions after June 1, 1938, but those approved by the Governor may receive pensions at that exchange rate.'" The motion was passed unanimously. Then, the lawyers submitted for first, second, and third readings and passed "The Draft Law Extending the Term of Legal Authority of Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India and China to Issue Banknotes." It was passed unanimously. Finally, the following draft laws were passed at the second and third readings: (A) Draft Amendment to the 1899 Merchant Shipping Ordinance, (B) Draft Amendment to the 1936 Telegraph Ordinance, (C) Draft Amendment to the 1937 Gold Standard Salary Remittance Ordinance, (D) Draft Amendment to the 1933 Naval Volunteer Ordinance, (E) Draft Amendment to the 1901 Rating Ordinance, (F) Draft Amendment to the 1873 Dangerous Goods Ordinance, (G) Draft Amendment to the 1932 Pension Ordinance. Regarding the Telegraph Ordinance draft, which authorized the Postmaster and his staff to search residences at any time, Councillor Lo Man Kam expressed the opinion that there was a risk of abuse or disturbance to residents and should be considered. The Attorney General immediately explained that this was a necessary measure in times of emergency and then sought the opinions of everyone. With the exception of Councillor Lo, everyone else expressed their approval, and the draft was passed by a majority vote.</p>

<h3>Admiral Noble to Arrive in Hong Kong Tomorrow; Will Go to Weihaiwei to Avoid the Summer Heat</h3>
<p>Admiral Sir Percy Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, will return to Hong Kong aboard the flagship HMS Kent after attending the British-French summit military conference in Singapore, together with Lieutenant General McNair, Commander of the Army.

<h3>Telegrams Still Reachable Between Hong Kong and China; However, No Telegrams Received in Three Days; Fujian Provincial Bank Also Sends Telegraphic Transfers</h3>
<p>Although telegrams between Hong Kong and Fuzhou are still communicable, most Fuzhou merchants in Hong Kong have not received telegrams from Fuzhou for three days since the 27th. It is rumored that although telegrams are communicable, they must be relayed through other places, resulting in delays in transmission, or that telegrams are being blocked because Chuanshi Island has been occupied, as the Great Northern Telegraph Company's submarine cable station is also located on that island. Although the Bank of China and other banks in Hong Kong have announced a suspension of remittances to Fuzhou, the Hong Kong branch of the Fujian Provincial Bank can still send telegraphic transfers. As of yesterday, it had not yet received a notice from the provincial headquarters to suspend, so the rumors of war in Fuzhou are likely false, it is said.</p>

<h3>×××. Cannot be Reborn! The Suffering and Prospects of Chaoshan</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>After Attending the Cadre Meeting of the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese Association</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<p>For national hatred and hometown friendship, the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese Association held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday evening at the Nanhua College building to provide relief to our homeland. Zhang Jiayan, Wang Yongzhan, Wang Youjian, Lin Tianduo, Chen Changwei, Cai Chusheng, Luo Yinpu and other directors spared time to attend. Those present included Lu Fu, Cai Hansun, Cai Xuetian, Huang Xinjing, Lin Gao, Zhu Qizhuo, etc. Usually, this should have been a joyful gathering with the right timing, location, and people. However, the flames of war raging in our hometown, the sins and disgrace of humanity, weighed heavily on the hearts of travelers abroad. With old and new sorrows, who would have the interest to pay attention to the beautiful and tranquil night scene where Lion Rock Road connects to the suburbs!</p>
<p>There are already transport ships traveling between Shantou and Hong Kong, but the postal service is not yet open. Foreign firms specialize in sending letters that have already arrived in Hong Kong. The number of wounded soldiers transported from Shantou is in the hundreds and seventies. It is absolutely true that we have fierce resistance along the Chaoshan Railway. Although news reports still have weaknesses, it is also inappropriate to emphasize the theory of failure and to be excessively pessimistic and depressed. After exchanging words, the official meeting started at around 8 o'clock.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Tianduo first gave a speech: "Our hometown, Shantou, and Chao'an have fallen one after another! We have long anticipated the conspiracy of the × people. Looking at the overall war situation, there is no need to be pessimistic. However, the refugees are displaced, and other tasks are waiting for us to complete. How should we do it? Please express your opinions."</p>
<p>"You come from your hometown, you should know the affairs of your hometown." Mr. Yongzai suggested this, and everyone agreed. Mr. Lin Gao stood up and reported the process of the fall of Shantou in great detail with great sorrow. Readers who want to know the details, please read Mr. Lin's eyewitness account of the fall of Shantou – serialized in the domestic section of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. C reported on the emergency meeting of the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese Disaster Relief Association. He also said that the elders in the hometown have unspeakable pain for the fall of their hometown. Explaining the development of the overall situation and assisting in the disaster relief work, our association should take this responsibility.</p>
<p>The first item of discussion was to concentrate the Chaoshan people in Hong Kong under the banner of saving their hometown, to exert the greatest strength in each position, and to concentrate all the strength to do some work that should be done for their hometown and country. The method is for the association to send a letter to the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese Disaster Relief Association expressing its willingness to participate in assisting work, so as to closely link the business community and the cultural community. If the association sympathizes, it will nominate Lin Tianduo, Wang Youjian, Luo Yinpu, and Cai Xuetian as the association's fully authorized representatives.</p>
<p>The fate of Chaoshan is one part of the fate of the entire country. Without suffering, there will be no rebirth. The day when the × people are driven out of the Chaoshan territory will be the time to build a new Chaoshan. There will be no vitality; new life will not be produced; pure steel cannot be forged if it cannot withstand the test in the furnace. The entire overseas Chinese nation must resist the war and build the country. Chaoshan must also resist the war and build the country.</p>
<p>The current issue is how to support the long-term resistance of Chaoshan and how to start the work of building a new Chaoshan. The new Chaoshan not only eliminates foreign insults, but also overturns the historical pressure. The politics are clarified, everyone helps each other, unites, and strives upwards. We must use these meanings to comfort the Chaoshan compatriots at home and abroad, and fulfill the responsibility of the Hong Kong overseas Chinese cultural people – everyone agreed to this proposal, and the declaration was drafted by Mr. C and submitted to the executive committee for approval.</p>
<p>In addition to the declaration, a booklet should also be published, containing the process of the fall of Chaoshan, and invite Hong Kong overseas Chinese cultural people to write articles, so that the action has a correct indicator, and the scattered forces are concentrated. The method is to establish an editorial committee and nominate Cai Chusheng, Luo Yinpu, Chen Changwei, Cai Han, Cai Xuetian, Zhang Jiayan, Wang Yongzai, Wu Qimin, Zhu Qizhuo, etc. as members.</p>
<p>Relief for students who have dropped out of school and guidance for refugees are also a major plan for the hometown for a century. It was decided to establish a Chaoshan Student Relief Committee, and Lin Tianduo, Wang Youjian, Zhang Jiazhai, Cai Hansun, and Wang Yongzai were nominated as members.</p>
<p>Chaoshan has its own special Chaoshan dialect. The Chaoshan opera movement for resisting war and building the country needs to be launched on a large scale. There is no shortage of young people in Hong Kong who love opera, and their vitality is waiting to be developed. Therefore, Mr. Yongzai was elected to be responsible for the plan. Cai Chusheng, Tan Youliu and other senior figures in the drama industry have already paid attention to this issue. They will definitely give more guidance.</p>
<p>Regarding participation in the joint fundraising association of all sectors, Mr. Lu Fu was nominated to be responsible for contact. The last item of discussion was the decision to hold a general meeting of all members at the Shengxin Hotel at 1:00 p.m. on July 8th, and to bid farewell to Mr. L, the representative of the association, who will go abroad. It is hoped that after he goes abroad, he will investigate the situation of the Chaoshan overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and the Americas, and mobilize the organization and unity of the Chaoshan overseas Chinese to work together to save the country.</p>
<p>The meeting did not end until around 12 o'clock. On the way back, we also talked about the vast number of young people in Chaoshan who have been trained will definitely work harder to mobilize and organize countless ordinary people to assist the government and the army in developing the guerrilla warfare in Chaoshan. These hard-working young people are the soul of the nation and the new life of the hometown. China has a way, and Chaoshan also has a way.</p>
<h3>From July 1st, a Cyclical Water Rationing System will be Implemented in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Water will be Rationed for Six Hours Every Other Day, from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM the Next Morning.</h3>
<p>Heavy rain poured down last month, and all reservoirs were overflowing. The Public Works Department increased the supply of drinking water to be open all day and canceled restrictions. However, after only a little over a month, the Public Works Department, considering the large amount of drinking water consumed daily, and in order to prepare for a rainy day, restricted it again. A notice has been issued yesterday that starting from the first day of next month, water will be reduced every other day in Hong Kong and Kowloon for six hours, from 10:00 PM every night to 4:00 AM the next morning. The water supply will be suspended. Hong Kong will be open from 4:00 AM to 10:00 PM daily starting from July 1st, and the supply will be suspended after 10:00 PM. Kowloon will also be restricted in the same way as Hong Kong starting from July 2nd.</p>

<h3>New Business in the Isolated Island: Women's Shoe Shining Company</h3>
<p>Leather shoes are a kind of the most popular and the most common shoe, people who are not from the upper class also wear them. That is, even the middle class and even workers also have desire to buy it. At the very least, they also buy a pair of cheap goods at used goods stalls on the roadside. Therefore, the leather shoe industry has developed very much invisibly. Due to the needs, they must seek refinement. Therefore, the designs of the leather shoes also evolved with the times, from flat heels to high heels, from round heads to pointed heads, and recently a new type of cream leather soles has been launched... etc., there are many, many styles, which are indeed very suitable for the needs of the public. However, cream soles...etc., noble leather shoes are the footwear of the upper-class young masters and young ladies. There is nowhere that they are not particular about. Also because of their fastidiousness, they specially came up with the idea of using women to replace them to shine their leather shoes, so that their leather shoes are always kept shiny at all times. This is naturally the happiness of the young masters and young ladies.</p>
<p>Women's shoe shining companies must be set up near the prosperous areas, such as the "Lovely Feet Women's Shoe Shining Company" near the racecourse. The interior decoration is very simple. Apart from five or six women, there is nothing else. Their attire is very strange. They look like half-female students and half-factory workers. When a guest comes, they invite them to sit down very diligently, and then they start working - shining shoes. Their shoe shining is indeed very experienced. The fee for patent leather is 14 cents, champagne leather is 14 cents, ordinary leather is 7 cents, and whitening powder is 4 cents. The busiest time of the whole day is when the lights are on in the evening, because many fashionable men and women have already started to go out. They want to show off, and they keep running in there, which makes them overwhelmed. Their business is also exceptional, and they usually stop around 11:00 p.m., which is just right for the taste of night owls.</p>
<h3>To Raise Funds for Refugee Relief, Hardoon Garden will be Opened. The International Shelter's Radio Class Has Been Training for Six Months and the Performance is Not Bad</h3>
<p>The provision of food for Shanghai refugees has always been a problem. Many people in charge of refugee shelters are anxious about the future funding for the refugees. Recently, I heard that someone is contacting the owner of Hardoon Garden, hoping to open it once. The ticket sales after the opening can generate at least hundreds of thousands of dollars. The refugee expenses for the two months of summer vacation can be taken care of with that money.</p>
<p>It is said that Mrs. Hardoon has not yet agreed. For the food and clothing of hundreds of thousands of refugees, Mrs. Hardoon, who likes to do good deeds, does not seem to insist any longer. If this plan can be realized, it would be a great good thing.</p>
<p>Hardoon Garden was opened once one or two decades ago (it is said that the scenery inside is excellent). If it is opened again now, it is indeed a rare event!</p>
<p>The above news can only be regarded as an incidental report.</p>
<p>Recently, I went to visit the children's radio training class attached to the First International Shelter on Massenet Road. At the same time, I also received an unfortunate news, that the shelter has received an order from the general association and is now dispersing the refugees, so that people who have a hometown and a job can gradually leave the shelter. The shelter is expected to be closed in the near future.</p>
<p>Although we cannot say that refugees must rely on refugee shelters forever, the financial difficulties of the relief society are evident here.</p>
<p>The address of the First International Shelter was originally the playground of Aurora University. Aurora has also urged it several times to take it back for its own use. It seems that the First Shelter will have to be closed soon.</p>
<p>When I went there yesterday, I saw the shelter's reed shed door piled high with packages and scattered items. I guess these are the belongings of the refugees who are leaving the shelter.</p>
<p>I had a half-hour conversation with the director of the shelter, Mr. Pan, and the director of the education group, Mr. Li Fucheng. They led me to visit the classroom of the radio class. It was already noon, and sixteen or seventeen-year-old refugee boys and girls were eating their most frugal lunch at their classroom tables.</p>
<p>On the 11th, this radio class invited the managers of several radio companies in Shanghai, such as Mr. Li Weishou and Mr. Yang Shufen, to serve as judges and hold a radio communication performance.</p>
<p>The method of the performance was to use an English manuscript, which was sent by the professor in radio code, and the boys and girls received it on the spot. The second step was for the students to send and receive themselves.</p>
<p>It is said that the performance was not bad that day.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Fucheng said that the students in this training class were originally recommended by the three shelters of the International Shelter itself. In addition, other shelters also recommended many people.</p>
<p>When it first started, there were about fifty or sixty people. Later, those with poor vision and hearing were removed. Now the class has thirty-four students, six or seven of whom are girls.</p>
<p>The training steps are divided into two types. The first is the elementary training class, which focuses on receiving and sending reports. The second is the advanced training class, which focuses on the repair and installation of transceivers. The training time is six months.</p>
<p>According to the current time allocation of the course, six months is of course quite short. If students can work hard, they can of course cope with it.</p>
<p>According to Director Pan, there is absolutely no problem with the way out after six months of training, because there is a large demand for this type of talent everywhere.</p>
<p>The coaches are Mr. Zhang Heqing and Mr. Wang Shuling. They are completely voluntary and do not receive any salary. This spirit is admirable.</p>
<p>In terms of production in the shelter, they are also planning to manufacture red and blue ink. After many experiments, this plan has been approved by the general office and production is expected to begin soon.</p>
<p>It is said that every refugee in this First Shelter is a productive worker. Some have jobs outside and some work in the shelter. It is indeed not easy for a shelter to reach this level.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I also visited the nursery set up in the shelter for the refugees. When I visited, there were about a dozen children aged six or seven sitting at a low rectangular table eating. They were all fat and chubby. One of them stood up and bowed to me. I smiled and nodded to him. He immediately turned around and said to his little friend,</p>
<p>"He nodded to me!"</p>
<p>Mr. Pan and Mr. Li and I all laughed.</p>
<p>The innocence of the children is lovely enough here.</p>
<h3>The Life of Light Bulb Workers</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Due to a friend's introduction, I had the opportunity to visit the actual work of a certain light bulb factory and interviewed the lives of the male and female workers there in detail. Below is the description of the living conditions of the workers in various departments that I learned from the interviews.</p>
<p>Sorting S</p>
<p>The filament in a small light bulb, its installation shape, is like an "S" shape, so sorting the filament is generally called "sorting S" by the light bulb workers. Sorting S is done by female workers, who are all around fifteen to twenty-five years old, because only such young women have the patience and can carefully and thoughtfully complete this work. This is an extremely long and fine steel wire, which has been refined and cut by engineers using scientific methods before it can be used for assembling the filament on the light bulb. It must be sorted and selected. They need to have sharp eyesight, otherwise this extremely small "S" is almost impossible to see, so the work is very tiring for the eyes and the brain. Working at the desk all day long often makes them dizzy, lightheaded, and backache. Although their wages are slightly higher than those of ordinary female workers, they can only earn five or six cents to seven or eight cents a day.</p>
<p>Making S</p>
<p>This is the work of male workers, using molten glass tubes to stick the two filaments together. They sit next to the fierce acetylene stove all day long, constantly working. Whether it is winter or summer, they are always covered in sweat, soaking their clothes. Their suffocation and unbearable heat are no different from the blacksmiths next to the furnace. They are one of the more difficult types of workers in the various departments, but their wages are very limited, about the same as the female workers who sort S.</p>
<p>Blowing Bubbles</p>
<p>This department is staffed by boys and girls, mostly aged ten to fourteen. Their work is even more painful than the workers who make S, because they work next to the fierce acetylene stove all day long, and they also have to hold the extremely hot glass tube in their mouths, aiming at the flames to suck and blow, suck and blow, until the molten glass forms the shape of a bubble. They are probably still in the learning stage, so their wages are pitifully low, only about one to three yuan per month.</p>
<p>Extracting Air</p>
<p>This is a department staffed by important workers. They must have scientific and chemical knowledge, that is, after the glass bubbles are blown, they must use chemical substances and scientific methods to extract the air from it before the copper head and filament can be assembled. Their wages are higher than those of ordinary male and female workers, about forty to seventy or eighty yuan per month.</p>
<p>Applying Plaster</p>
<p>To assemble the copper head to the top of the bubble, plaster must be applied. This is also the work of the female workers, both old and young. Their wages are calculated on a piecework basis, two to three cents per thousand pieces, so although their work is relatively easy, their income can still reach more than ten to twenty yuan per month.</p>
<p>Soldering Tin</p>
<p>To firmly connect the "S" and the copper head, in addition to the adhesion of the plaster, tin must also be soldered on top, because this is a relatively easy part to do, so it is only done by male workers who are slightly older among the child laborers. But their hardship is comparable to that of those who make S and blow bubbles. Their wages are four to six or seven yuan per month.</p>
<p>Picking Bubbles</p>
<p>This is the easiest part of all the departments. All they have to do is pick out the bubbles with damaged marks. This is done by the female workers and child workers who first entered the factory, and their wages are only one to three yuan. In addition, there is also a piecework system (limited to female workers) or temporary employment, paying three cents for every thousand pieces, and they can earn three to five cents a day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Concessions Trolley Company Uses Vouchers. The Ministry of Finance Remedies the Shortage of Copper Coins in Shanghai and Will Issue Fractional Notes to Eliminate the Difficulty.</h3>
<p>The shortage of copper coins in Shanghai is felt by all industries. The public buses and trolley companies in the British and French concessions have used vouchers to facilitate passengers. The Ministry of Finance will follow the practice of the shortage of copper coins in the interior and issue fractional notes to be transported to Shanghai to remedy the situation. Therefore, it is hoped that the shortage of copper coins will gradually be eliminated in a short period of time. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>French Tram Company Voucher</p>
<p>French concession tram public buses were greatly inconvenienced in business due to the refusal to accept stamps and receipts. To remedy this, the company authorities have been using vouchers since yesterday. These vouchers are divided into one-cent and two-cent denominations, made of cardboard, with Chinese and English translations, limited to use within the French concession. The notice from Mr. Viali, the general manager of the company, is recorded as follows: "The one-cent and two-cent vouchers of this company are only applicable within the French concession. Each ticket seller can only receive a maximum of two yuan to replace the shortage of legal tender, and must not be given at will unless absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>Public Concession Tram Company</p>
<p>Since the copper coin shortage, the British tram company in the Public Concession, although not refusing to use stamps, has found it increasingly difficult for ticket sellers to sell tickets and calculate fares. Therefore, it has taken the same steps as the French Concession Tram Company and has also issued two-cent and three-cent denominations, made of thin cardboard. The three-cent denomination is light lake blue, and the two-cent denomination is unpolished rice color, which is easy to distinguish. The vouchers are printed with Chinese and English instructions, and are printed with red Arabic numerals "3" and "2". The Chinese characters "three cents" and "two cents" are hollow characters. At the bottom of the vouchers, there are rolled eyelets, and at the top, there are printed serial numbers. The company stipulates that these vouchers can not only be used on the trams, but can also be redeemed at the company's office at 185 Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance will issue fractional notes to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>All industries use stamps as small change in their business, and have gradually become accustomed to it over time, so the panic situation is not as serious as it was at the beginning. The problem of the smuggling of copper coins from Shanghai began after the Western Expedition of the National Army, so the government has long paid attention to this. According to news from the banking sector, the Ministry of Finance will follow the practice of the interior to make up for the lack of copper coins, issue fractional notes, and transport them to Shanghai to remedy the situation. Therefore, the difficulty of the copper coin shortage can be expected to be eliminated in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Jottings</h3>
<p>Industry Bureau Library Adds Documents and Books</p>
<p>The Industry Bureau Library Committee held its first meeting of the year on the 12th of this month. Committee member Xi Yushu was elected as the chairman of the committee. During the meeting, the committee members submitted a list of Chinese books proposed to be purchased this year for consideration. The list included 127 types of books, valued at approximately 950 yuan in national currency. Among them was a photographic reprint of the "Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times," comprising 808 volumes, divided into six categories: Astronomy, Geography, Ethics, Natural History, Philosophy, and Economics. According to records, the original book was published approximately 309 years ago. Its content spans both ancient and modern times, combining classics and history, and it is truly a comprehensive overview of Chinese classics. The photographic reprint that the Industry Bureau Library Committee intends to purchase is published by the Zhonghua Book Company. At a meeting held on the 14th of this month, the Industry Bureau Board of Directors resolved to approve the entire book list proposed by the Library Committee and to allocate 950 yuan for the purchase of the aforementioned "Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times" and the other 126 types of books.</p>
<p>Shanghai Second Special District Court Burns Prohibited Items</p>
<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, as a matter of established practice, publicly burns confiscated opium, opium paraphernalia, morphine, red pills, and other drugs, as well as gambling and other prohibited items every three months. This has been done 21 times in the past. Now, for the six-month period from July of last year to the end of December, covering the 22nd and 23rd sessions, the items were handed over by the former President Wang Simo to the new President Yang Qi for management. President Yang, together with Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang, held a joint public burning of the narcotics and other contraband from both sessions. A report was first submitted to the higher-level Third Branch Court, which then forwarded it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, designating Zheng Yue, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch Court, to supervise the proceedings on-site. The 22nd session involved the burning of 120 sets of opium paraphernalia, 518 opium pipes, 200-odd pounds of opium, 29 kilograms, 1323 taels, six maces, three fen, and 1226 and a half packets, 989 opium bubbles, 5 pounds, 86 taels, six maces, and 101 small packets of fake opium ingredients, 10 pounds, 51 bags, and one packet of red pills, 846 grains and six packets of white powder, 243 packets of heroin powder, one and a half pounds of morphine, 42 taels, six maces, 2036 packets, half a pound and one packet, 43 taels and one bottle of morphine, 12 morphine needles, and other miscellaneous small packets of drug-making equipment, an uncounted number of gambling paraphernalia, 921 mahjong tiles, 49 dice, 10 prohibited imitation handguns, 821 counterfeit banknotes, 302 obscene books, 390 obscene photographs, nine soft film negatives, 24 glass film negatives, and an uncounted number of fake trademark gift certificates, checks, and miscellaneous items. The 23rd session involved the burning of 308 taels of opium, 149 opium pipes, 55 pounds of opium, 75 kilograms, 13,800 cubic centimeters, 28 catties, 2615 taels, three maces, 320 small packets, and one suitcase of opium, three maces of opium residue, 2538 opium bubbles, 31 taels of opium paste, 161 red and black pills, 4 pounds of morphine, 87 taels, three maces, two fen, 4499 small packets of morphine, two taels, six maces of heroin, 224 small packets, five morphine needles, and other miscellaneous items, an uncounted number of gambling paraphernalia, four mahjong tiles, 4812 Huahui lottery tickets, one general blueprint, two Huahui books, and other miscellaneous items, an uncounted number of prohibited items, three handguns, 47 yuan and five jiao and 61 counterfeit banknotes, 184 obscene books, one blood-stained garment, and other miscellaneous items, an uncounted number of miscellaneous items. The burning began at 2:00 PM and concluded at 6:00 PM in the evening. The representatives dismissed and departed. The ashes were bagged, hired boats, and dumped into the sea outside of Wusong Port.</p>
<p>Compromise Reportedly Reached in Shanghai Pseudo-Police Station Incident</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, in the incident of the "Da Dao" pseudo-police returning to the pseudo-police "substation" on Great West Road, which was sealed off by British troops, the British military commander and the Public Concession police authorities made representations to the Japanese military authorities amidst heightened tensions. The negotiations between the two sides lasted for quite some time, and it is expected that a satisfactory resolution can be reached. According to the propaganda organ newspaper controlled by the Japanese and their puppet regime, a verbal compromise has been reached on the matter, as follows: (1) The barbed wire erected by the British soldiers should be removed; (2) The pseudo-police substation should display a sign with the words "Great West Road Police Substation" at the entrance, allowing people to enter and exit; (3) The above measures should be implemented within one week.</p>
<p>Speculators Manipulate Shanghai Rice Prices, Causing Sharp Rise</p>
<p>Due to speculation and manipulation by hoarding households, massive purchases continued in the bean and rice market, causing prices to continue to rise sharply. Market transactions were exceptionally chaotic. Premium white japonica rice from Changshu rose to over 21 yuan. The Rice Trade Association has suggested to the Concession authorities that they promptly take measures to stop this. As for the overall supply of staple food, there is no risk of shortage.</p>
<p>Economic Notes</p>
<h3>New Financial Stabilization Measures by Sheng Mujie</h3>
<p>(Special Shanghai Dispatch) After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the Ministry of Finance implemented emergency financial stabilization measures and supplementary measures to stabilize finances. After 22 months of operation, there have been no major obstacles. Recently, after the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted exchange rates, the Ministry of Finance implemented a new financial stabilization measure on June 22nd. The content is very simple: in general, payments for deposits up to 500 yuan will be made in legal tender, and payments for amounts over 500 yuan will be made by remittance. Deposits made before August 13th will still be handled according to the financial stabilization measures. Funds remitted to the mainland are not subject to these measures. At the same time, these measures are limited to implementation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The state of Shanghai's finances during the war was initially stable due to the implementation of financial stabilization measures. Although the situation was tense, the crisis was relatively minor. However, the effectiveness of the financial stabilization measures gradually diminished over time. At the same time, the emergence of the remittance and rediscount system further weakened the effectiveness of the financial stabilization measures in blocking funds. This year, the signs of instability in Shanghai's finances have gradually become apparent. I have discussed these two points before. First, the result of Shanghai's financial prosperity due to the abundance of funds cannot be ignored. Because Shanghai has abundant funds, the current deposits of financial institutions have increased significantly. However, Shanghai lacks proper channels for utilization, and the inward transfer of funds to develop the southwest has not been fully utilized due to environmental factors. As a result, a large portion of the funds has been diverted to speculative activities, resulting in high commodity prices and distorted industrial development in the concessions. This phenomenon is not only detrimental to the stability of Shanghai's financial market but also runs counter to the government's wartime financial policy. Second, the pressure on foreign exchange. Shanghai's foreign trade has accumulated a deficit of approximately 100 million yuan in the first five months of this year. The monthly trade situation shows that imports have increased and exports have decreased, and the accumulated deficit is increasing, requiring a larger amount of foreign exchange. At the same time, the arbitrage of the Japanese and their puppet regime is also lurking. Therefore, the financial stabilization measures are now almost a dead letter.</p>
<p>Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted exchange rates on June 7th, the foreign exchange market has been clearly in an unstable state. Although the spot market price is equal to the exchange rate quoted by HSBC, the futures market is extremely sluggish. The difference between spot and futures prices is large, and arbitrage is as high as five points. As a result, speculators are flocking to arbitrage. Shanghai's finances are in a tense state under this situation. Interbank lending rates and remittance rediscount rates are rising. If there is no way to limit the development of this phenomenon, it will still be a very harmful pressure on the adjusted exchange rate. Therefore, in order to ensure the stability of the exchange market, it is only possible to restrain legal tender—this is the greatest reason for the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures.</p>
<p>The most obvious benefit of implementing the new financial stabilization measures is the reduction in the need for foreign exchange speculation and the balancing of currently speculative commodity prices. The most obvious drawback is the difficulty in commercial turnover. At the same time, because the measures are too simple, there are many contradictions in their implementation. For example, a check with a crossed-out amount of more than 500 yuan deposited into a bank is sometimes accepted and sometimes not, saying it is a remittance. The former is of course correct, and the latter is unavoidable. Because the crossed-out amount can originally be paid in cash, the Ministry of Finance's new measures only say that it can only be withdrawn at a rate of 500 yuan per week, and it does not say that the crossed-out amount has become a remittance. In short, the silver and money industries in Shanghai should come up with a detailed supplementary measure to ensure that commercial transactions can still be flexible under the principle of blocking funds.</p>
<p>Finally, after the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures, the remittance rediscount system should be abolished. Otherwise, if the amount exceeds 500 yuan, it is a remittance, and funds cannot be blocked.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Feels Uneasy After the Price of Legal Tender Drops; Capital of "Huaxing" Bank Decreases by 400,000 Pounds</h3>
<p>According to the Millard's Review, the recently established "Huaxing Bank" by the Japanese, which issues "Huaxing" banknotes, aims to carry out a trick to obtain foreign exchange. After issuing banknotes, Huaxing Bank can directly or indirectly obtain Chinese legal tender and purchase foreign exchange. The total capital of the bank is 50 million Chinese yuan. According to the original plan, it was intended to gradually convert it into foreign exchange. However, after the Hong Kong Exchange Equalization Fund Committee readjusted the exchange rate of legal tender, not only was Shanghai surprised, but Huaxing was also frustrated. Because, according to the new exchange rate, the bank's capital has decreased by 400,000 pounds. No wonder the Hongkou area was greatly disturbed after hearing about the drop in the foreign exchange rate.</p>
<h3>The Scenery of Chinese Herbal Medicine Shops</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>A Chinese medicine shop, unless it has about a thousand different types of medicinal herbs, shells, and mineral stones, from cheap tangerine peel to expensive antelope horn, is not considered complete.</p>
<p>At the lowest estimate, about four hundred types of medicinal ingredients are used daily. And according to the doctor's instructions, some medicinal materials must first be soaked in honey or human milk, and some must be boiled with salt or rice wine before they can be used.</p>
<p>The Chinese materia medica is like a fruit shop's catalog. For example, watermelon, which is used as a cold drink in summer, occupies an important place in the treatment of heatstroke. Other ingredients such as lotus leaves, lotus seeds, olives (especially the dried ones from Tibet), almonds, longans, persimmons, loquats, and pears are also effective medicines for coughs.</p>
<p>The Chinese materia medica is also like a list from a zoo. Tiger bones can treat rheumatism, and there are also turtle shells, antelope horns, cicada shells, deer velvet (worth 300 yuan per ounce), dead silkworms, rhinoceros horns, scorpions, and centipedes, among others. The last two are relatively rarely used.</p>
<p>Among these, there are three rare and precious things worth mentioning. One is Maba, which is said to be found in the pastures of Mongolia and Manchuria. We can find a horse with a peculiar temperament that often breathes deeply under the moonlight and does not eat for several days. After killing it, we can get a stone-like "treasure" in its stomach, which is the best medicine for treating nervous disorders. There are also such hard lumps in the bones of cows and dogs. These three medicinal materials can only be bought in a few large pharmacies.</p>
<p>Some other Chinese medicines are like things in a general store, including mint for treating colds, garlic for treating stomach pain, wine, vinegar, and salt. It is said that the last one is used to treat internal heat.</p>
<p>Most Chinese medicinal materials are grass roots, while mineral stones and shells make up the majority. Various medicinal materials must be purchased from special places. However, many small pharmacies also buy cheaper goods from other places and sell them as genuine products.</p>
<p>Pharmacies use taels as the unit. Although most medicinal materials only cost a few cents per tael, a typical Chinese medicine prescription for two doses always costs around one yuan.</p>
<p>Someone who works as a "sir" in a Chinese medicine shop must undergo a long period of training before being qualified. The baskets of medicine drawers are arranged against the wall. Each drawer contains various medicinal materials. The person dispensing the medicine must first know the order in which these drawers are placed. Therefore, without three years of apprenticeship, one cannot know how the thousand different medicinal ingredients are placed.</p>
<p>Unlike foreign pharmacies that take the prescription to the dispensing room, the Chinese medicine shop's dispensing clerk dispenses various medicinal ingredients in front of the customer. First, he places the prescription on the counter. Then, he walks between the counter and the drawers, taking out different medicines from each drawer and placing them on several small square papers.</p>
<p>A typical Chinese medicine prescription contains nine to thirteen ingredients. Therefore, he has to go back and forth so many times. When he has weighed the last medicinal ingredient, a clerk responsible for checking the medicine comes to check it carefully to see if there are any errors in the dispensing. After that, he stamps the prescription with a responsible seal. The person dispensing the medicine then takes a ball of soft paper, prints the name and efficacy of the medicinal ingredient on it, and wraps up all the various medicinal ingredients.</p>
<p>An ordinary person really does not know how to use a thin paper, four inches square, to wrap up a certain amount of medicine. He would definitely feel that either the paper is too small, or the paper is folded too wrinkled, or even torn. However, the clerk in a Chinese medicine shop can wrap it up quickly and neatly.</p>
<p>Then, the dispenser uses a large sheet of paper to wrap all the packets together, places the prescription on top, and ties it up with a thin rope. The price is usually written on the prescription. On weekdays, we can always get a 10% discount, and on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, we can get an extra 10% discount.</p>
<p>Some Chinese medicine shops also give away jujubes or other sweets for free to relieve the bitter taste after the patient tastes the medicinal soup.</p>
<p>Now, there are also services that boil the medicine for customers. They put the boiled medicine in two thermos bottles, and each dose costs only five cents. Chinese doctors rarely tell patients whether the medicinal soup should be taken before or after meals, but most people believe that it is better to take it before meals, otherwise the effectiveness of the medicine is easily diluted by food.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Teachers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Generally speaking, elementary school teachers are the poorest in the education field. They are busy from morning to night, and their income is only enough to make ends meet. Although Shanghai is a prosperous city, the poverty of elementary school teachers is no exception.</p>
<p>The qualifications of elementary school teachers are as follows: (1) graduates of normal schools; (2) university students; (3) high school graduates; (4) kindergarten normal school graduates; (5) others. The high school graduates mentioned above include senior high school and junior high school graduates. Kindergarten normal school graduates mostly regard kindergarten teachers as the most ideal way out, and they are all women. Other items include former Qing scholars and those from general private schools.</p>
<p>The treatment of elementary school teachers varies depending on the situation of the school. Generally speaking, public elementary schools used to be better than private elementary schools, and private elementary schools varied depending on the development of their school affairs and the treatment of their teachers. In general, teaching is paid according to the number of clock hours. Teachers in the first and second years are paid three cents per hour, those in the third and fourth years are paid four cents per hour, and those in the fifth and sixth years are paid five cents per hour. Therefore, the monthly income of an elementary school teacher is usually around thirty yuan. Those who can earn forty or fifty yuan per month are very few. Generally, kindergarten teachers, especially those who are principals, can get a monthly salary of about thirty-five yuan, while assistant teachers get about twenty yuan. This refers to public schools. Private schools are probably far less than this.</p>
<p>After the war, elementary school teachers in Shanghai, with the exception of a very small number, suffered a huge blow. Most of their schools were in the war zone or near the war zone, so they could not start school for a while, and their lives became a problem. A few lucky ones were able to temporarily find a place to live in schools that were not affected by the shelling, but the majority were unemployed and lived a very miserable life. Later, when the environment was slightly calmer, some elementary schools borrowed one or two temporary classrooms from other schools in the concession to continue teaching, but the treatment of teachers was truly miserable. Some elementary school teachers only got four or five yuan a month in travel expenses, which was really extremely bitter, but the principal was still sighing about losing money. Some elementary schools started new schools in the concession and reopened, but the salaries of teachers were said to be discounted due to the high rent. Those who used to earn thirty or forty yuan can now only get about twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Currently, because the number of immigrants in the concession has increased sharply, the number of school-age children has also increased greatly, and elementary school education has been able to develop particularly well. There are also elementary schools that have moved from the war zone to the concession. There are also newly established schools. Some schools that were originally in the concession have even opened branch schools due to the large number of students. However, elementary school teachers may not be able to live a slightly better life because of this.</p>
