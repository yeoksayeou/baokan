<p>再者、今日日本之貿易統制、已實放所謂一進出口連鎖制一、凡欲輸入原料、必需有同等價格之該項製造品之出口始可、戰事發生以來、『華北』麥產銳減、加以東北與日本國內亦大吿荒歉、最近米價飛漲之烈、尤可見其國內糧食恐慌之一斑、因此日粉之出口、無形中更受限制、</p>
<p>更有一重大之原因、此卽日本粉業資本之來華大　活動是、蓋自戰事發生以還、華商粉廠、幾全盤停頓、或被砲毀不存、日商乃藉其軍隊爲後盾、若不逕自侵領戰區內未毀之粉廠而自行開工外、或在威脅利誘之下强迫與華商在共同經營』下開工、若干日商、且謀獨佔中國市塲計、亦均先後來華設廠、或擴充其在華原有之工廠、大事增產、故今日淪陷區內之中日粉廠、幾全在日人手中復活、而統轄於日本三大粉閥、日本製粉』『日淸　粉一『日東製粉』之下、形成如此之壟斷陣綫、</p>
<p>日本製粉會社　該社現在「華北」擴有製粉工廠上一處、日產能力達萬二于包、如與在滬新設之工廠合計、日產力達一萬四千包之鉅、其中屬於支會社「三吉粉廠」者有三、由該廠直接經營者僅天津擁有一千二百五十包之一廠、此外七廠、皆係華商粉廠、現歸該會社經營者、故該社之粉廠、巳密佈於靑島、濟南、天津、濟寗、徐州等地、最近上海之福新第三廠、亦入該社手中、可見該社之勢力、現又伸入長江流域矣、</p>
<p>日消製粉會社目前該社僅有濟南及北平之兩廠、濟南之廠、且係日軍强佔華商粉廠、而在所謂「軍營領」下委託經營者、北平之廠、則係收負華商之粉廠而來、該社現尙正物色設廠地點、企圖參與獨佔中國粉市之競爭中、</p>
<p>日東製粉會社該社早在「華北」進出、但尙不及日本製粉會社之勢力浩大、惟最近開封方面有華商粉廠三家、己歸該社之　而復活、依該社之計劃、擬在平漢綫及山西一帶確定其獨佔粉市之地盤云、</p>
<p>就該三大粉閥目前之行動觀之、對于中國之粉市塲、似已分賊妥定、津浦綫一　帶以及長江流域、爲日本製粉　社所控　、平漢綫一帶以及西爲日東製粉會社之活動領域、日淸製粉會社、則有向平綏綫及北寗綫一帶及以北活動之趨勢、</p>

<h3 id="c7">抗戰一年來　海外僑胞救運概要　動員人力財力均著良好成績　港僑捐輸成績僅居第四五位 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>中央僑務委員會、最近發表抗戰一年來之僑務、對于一年來海外各埠華僑救國運動情况、捐輸人力物力財力之成績、有詳細報吿、茲擇要錄如下、藉使本港各界僑胞參攷、使益加奮勉、</p>
<p>抗戰開始　捐輸熱烈</p>
<p>蘆機橋事變發生後、政府尙未舉行募捐、　國公債雖已公布、而尙未開煩勸銷之時、華僑之捐助抗戰運動、早已風起雲湧、僑務委八員會最早收到之捐欵、在七月二十二日、自此以後、至八一三以前、計收到捐欽十八宗、數達八萬餘元、就八一三以後之捐欵、亦頗多爲八一三以前所匯寄者、其中溫哥華僑胞捐奇三萬五千二百元、西雅圖僑胞捐寄七萬一千一百八十六元、以時攷之、皆在七七以後八一三以　、由此事實、可見喬胞捐欵、不獨於數爲最　、且於時爲最早、其自發精神、固有足多、其中見遠識、亦有不可及者矣、</p>
<p>一年期間　達八千萬</p>
<p>華僑捐欵、匯交機關、至不統一、間有因當地環境關係、只能籌賑款而不能籌我捐、且此賑欵亦不　匯寄政治機關者、多寄中國紅—字會經收、間有因經募機關之從屬關係而匯寄者、例如由國民黨總支部、或支部經募者、則寄交中央黨部、使領館經募者、則寄交外交部、間有因捐款性質而　寄者、例如賬濟傷兵難民之捐欵、則寄眼務委員會、購允軍實之捐欵、則分寄軍事委員會或軍政部、或航空委員會、間有因鄕土關係而匯寄者、例如廣東僑胞、間有寄廣東省政收轉者、至於救國公債必寄交救國公債勸募委員會總會、或其他指定之銀行、更　明令所規定、此外逕寄行政院或財政部者、爲數亦甚不少、自不恃言、現財政部已着手向各經牧機關調查捐欵、總數大約最近之將來、　有詳確之報吿發表、依現時各方之估計、則僑胞捐款、總數已達八千萬元左右、此雖槪括之詞、要亦距寳際數月不還、至僑務委員會經收捐欵、各幣合計約合計國幣三十一萬三千餘元、其　匯僑務委員會而由救國公債勸募委員會總曾截收者、計國幣七十五萬四千二百九十四元九角七分、原匯僑務委員會而由中央銀行收轉救國公債勸募委員會總會者、計國幣二十九萬零九百九十元七角六分、原回僑務委員會而由中國銀行收轉財政部者、計國幣四萬四千一百四十元一角七分、總計約國幣一百四十萬元、</p>
<p>香港成績　居四五位</p>
<p>至各　捐款之比　、截致今年五月止、英屬馬來亞捐欵公債合數達二千四百餘萬元、首爲首屈一指、若依人口比例計之、則菲律濱僑胞人數約十一萬、捐欵及公債總數已達菲幣八百萬元、平均每人負担菲幣約八十元、是爲初期捐輸之冠、此外澳洲美洲等地、亦異常踴躍、（按、香港僑胞捐輸成續僅居於第四五位）、就此論之、僑胞之熱心、實各地盡同、偶有不同者、環境各異　、現在各地均已舉行有系統有計劃之常　捐、成績極有可觀　新加坡之常月捐辦法、係依照僑胞原有之鄉土組織、分福帮、廣帮、潮帮、客帮、瓊帮、　江帮等六帮、分頭勸募、此外凡華僑經營之事、就其物產每担抽百份之若干、每月可得一百五十萬元以上、菲律濱僑胞之實行勸募常月捐則係今年三月由菲律濱華僑援助抗×委員會發起主持者</p>
<p>經濟制裁　打擊×人</p>
<p>持久抗戰　基礎、在經濟力量之允實與鞏固、　實施方案、積極方面、在經濟建設、在消極方面、則當在經濟上給×人以打擊、此種特殊工作、華僑尤優爲之、蓋全世界均滿佈華僑、而華僑又多半爲零賣商、苟華僑一致起來排斥×貨、則日本國際貿易必受絕大之打擊　、　僑對日經濟馴裁、一年以來成效至舊、吾人苟一臺南洋一帶（主要華僑居留　）之日貨入口報吿、及×大藏省對南洋貿易之輸出統計、即可知僑胞對日經濟制裁爲力之、對日經濟制裁除抵貨外、封銷輸日原料亦爲主要工作之一、×人仰給兩洋之原　全多、就中以馬來亞之　爲　重要、在抗戰以前××、每年取給於馬來亞之鐵　、爲數在　百五十萬噸以上、抗戰開始後、各株巴轄××礦山之華僑工人首先停工、吉寧丹了如奴及柔佛各地受×僱用之工人亦先後停工、結果××礦山幾全部停頓、每月運往日本之鐵砂、共減少百分之九十以上</p>
<p>人力物力　動員情形</p>
<p>關於人力物力之動員情形、則更千頭萬緒、有書不勝書之慨、抗戰初起、海外僑胞之暹　囘　殺×者、日無盧千數百起、儒務委員會付僑胞此植　國壯志、固　激嘉許、但一方權漸利害、認爲僑胞之叢大任務、唯在輸財、若葉其千辛萬苦所爭得之職業地位、而反歸國從事甚練之兵役、實　用達其長、　通軍海外各地、勗僑胞以生產事業爲重、專負輪財輸力之兩大責任、自此以後、僑胞　　歸國之、已漸減少、但技術人員、則仍供給不斷、舉例曾之、如越南及美洲華僑之於航空人材、除將已造就者資送回國外、更以公費就地訓練航空生以宏浩、就最近旅美華僑更僑資成立「旅美華僑航、　學校」、以造就航空人材、其餘各地、對航空、機械、防空、防　、化學、交妒、工程、醫　、救護等專門人材、均有源源不　之供給云、（下略）</p>

<p>— 張敏</p>
<p>夜的香港，眞是美麗的香港—如果你徒中國的內　或歐美夜船到香港來：如果你從九龍夜船到香港來，跟着輪船的進，一座花燈一般的夜城就漸次的推到你面前來。三色的年紅燈是這火的皇冕的綴師；山間的燵帶宛如橫串的珍珠。把你自已幻想置身于一艘渡海的天星小輪中罷，跟着船程的推進，奇境漸次開展于　的眼前。</p>
<p>船近陸了，整齊的柏油路淸楚地橫列在你的眼前，船　岸了，一踏上碼頭，淋漓滿目的廣吿給這「遠東的商業中心」以明証。到街上——你在跟隨我似描述的嗎，——層疊的摩大廈排　在你跟前，兩旁塞滿了自用及和作汽車·維持交通的路警扭上紅燈，一切汽率中止進行，先容你急急趕過。</p>
<p>請繼續跟我來，　馬十卽置身于必打街了，到思豪酒店前沿着密排停放的汽車向右轉，你一壁走一壁要　疑香港每個居民也有一部　車，當你還未解决你的懷疑，你馬上就走到香港最偉人的出樓之一——吿　士打之下了。樓項上一面光茫的大鐘。時間指明是下午十時，夜正作騰沸開展的黃金時候。</p>
<p>然而，你已見了全維多利亞城放整齊修潔是體面的一部了，我勸你中止進行：但你一定不滿足于這短小得滑稽的行程　堅待走下去的好罷，請繼續西行——你在跟隨着我嗎？——過了郵局，我們沿着電車路，置身于這商業區的正心了。</p>
<p>當心汽車較安全，請走騎樓底下的行人道，當你正疑神鑒愼　都　風光的時你的脚不扭防却在　些障礙物上。當心，你正着一個人，幾乎摔了一交了。</p>
<p>天哪！寒凜的初冬天　肅瑟於破棉敗絮　這一堆一堆地排列在這行人道上的是人嗎？覇了。是露宿的人，　你隊我一樣的人。這不是奇蹟中之奇蹟嗎？十尺之外，川流着的　數汽車中，載有着無數醇飽歸來的紳士太太，上尺之內，滿躺了瑟綿街頭無家可歸的露宿者；一方面是暖襖輕裘，旣醉目飽，一方面是飢寒與痛苦。</p>
<p>露宿！是每年冬季香港的嚴重問題，橫街上是露宿的人，直街上也躺滿，以　只見　身的漢子，現在全家老小婦　都有了，尤其是×人南犯後，廣州和四鄕居民都相率來港，本港樓宇項求過於供的情勢下，唯利是視的業主們，將原有住客驅逐，轉租與　的富有住客，於是，這些無冢可歸的難同　和被業主迫遷者都到街頭來了！一張破蓆，一條破毛毡，細看枕在泥磚上的　苦的頭，一家男女老少就以這爲家、互相緊偎着藉體溫以取煖。這　人，每個人身後都有一段凄凉的故事，尤其是流亡異地的這些一家之衆，以前每人都有過很幸福的家庭，但都給××戕賊了一切了，無家多數無業，地們大都以行　爲生；偶或充充苦力，每大賺來的一兩毛　，實在不够幾口的飽煖。白天，　起了相依爲命的舖蓋，負在身上，成埋匿在人家的　底，　一個流　，到四邊去碰極他們的運氣，××××××一點冷飯殘羹。夜了。晚上—時十一時以後，商店上了門，大家爭佔　較不　店家出入的地方，就落地而臥：每夜每夜祈禱天氣的温和，連睡眠的時候　得碰運氣。傷是平常事，只冷望別到病重，更不要冷風價。就算到運了！</p>
<p>聖誕　夕，報載曾冷僵了三個，然而這才是開始呢，天時繼續要冷三個月，今後路　的凍死骨尙多，雖然有露宿救濟會，然而露宿者，眞止　多，而救濟會，實在太少了，正如日前新界的難民營之容不下許多雞民徒有設備而不敷，這實在是美中不足。</p>
<p>露宿于香　九龍的貧民由八十歲的老人到八天大的孩子都有，除了山　區及洋人住宅區外，那一處沒有他們了等到你午夜聽兒這些飢寒者的　泣聲，你將體味着這未見過的人世間的苦調。沒有比　更諷刺的對照的了：龍城譚公道上座別墅一般美麗的狗屋，譚公道　　橫地躺着露　者羣；他們的好夢，常爲狺的狗吠聲所驚醒，××××××××××××××××××××××××！</p>
<h3 id="c18">澳門紀遊 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>因爲抗戰關係，港中多少商衆飽受摧殘：同時正因爲抗戰，各奴樂消費的營業，却蓬勃萬丈。這自然是一種不合常規的畸形的發展。澳鬥也就在這種，態中，發達起來了，記者乘着年假之使，跑到這個東方家特卡維的澳門去一，觀賞觀賞那裏熱烈的　况。走馬，花，所開不廣，爰　目覩情况約略紀述下來。</p>
<p>澳門底徵象</p>
<p>搭着開赴澳門的火輪，不消三點鐘的航　，她底；人底背影，便倏　眼前，滾滾　水，川流不息，小艇來件梭巡，喚渡呼賣，堤岸迤長，人行如。乍見之下，一切的　級人物，都沅惚像當年廣州的長堤。但如今五羊文物，飽蒙恥辱，繁華的長堤，巳成灰燼，思前想後，惹起了遊客的憤慨罷了！無何，輪船泊岸，『車　』猛力鼓動，翻江　海，海底的污泥，浮泛水面，還有很多拉圾污物，　波逐流地　着，一切似在　徵着澳門的呀！</p>
<p>澳門底進歩</p>
<p>輪船泊了岸，葡　站在碼頭上，臨風屹立，一衣，一帽，一履，倒富　觀。大艙，搭客，有釘些畢歸心似箭的，看見了吊橋放下，便馬上想登岸，給警察一掌打得倒退下來。原來　裏落客上岸的辦法，是和香港一樣的，西　房唐餐房的搭客得　優權，繼着的便是尾樓客，末了　是人艙的搭客，不過　門那邊還沒有實行二十元担保那條條　罷了！</p>
<p>演門在各處交通繁衝的　方，依然和外地一樣·設着交通的崗位，和站崗的警察。所　者，這裏的警裝是比較美觀點吧在路上，記者看見一羣橫過馬路的同胞，因　避軍，所以站在　上，那位交通警察看見了，很不　興的操着「半鹹半淡一的廣東口音，聲色俱　的　着，這是一幅很生動的圖書。五年前，記者會遊於此，還未兄　們幹得這樣認眞的，可是，五年過去了，是應該有點進步的吧！</p>
<p>賭徒的勇敢</p>
<p>白大的澳門，還算沉靜，兩輪的貨車「轆轆」的輾動，一些活潑的女學生，踏遠自山車，很寫意的在路上馳着。可是薄募黃昏過去，電炬開始　　火花，整個澳門都沸動了。在福隆　街一帶地方，一般窰子姑娘，都濃裝淡抹的招搖過　，或在甯子裏鼓着琴，輕舒歌　的唱着。燈光琴韻，掩　街前，尋芳客川流不息的走動　。雜　的人聲，賭館的　喝聲，旅舘的蔴活命，蕭　曹　的鬧成一片，一直到天亮還沒有停下來，熱　　了。那些賭徒下注的勇敢，和嫖客的奮不額身，多少和前方忠男將衝鋒肉搏，手刃仇×時的情形有點相似。所不同之處，就是嫖客寫的是尋找一已的浪狂歡娛而犧牲，將士則爲着爭取國家民族的自出生存而奮鬥；前者是馬驚，是　落的，後者是光榮，是偉大的。這就是兩者熱鬧同而實質逈異的所在。</p>
<p>下賭注和買公債</p>
<p>澳門的地方比香港小，澳門也不像香港的富商雲集，但那裏每天銷費的數目着實不少，那裏嫖賭飮吹的銷費，雖然是沒有止確的統計，不過某大酒家的賭塲，每天收人最　的時候，是曾超過二十幾萬的，其餘的銷費，也在可以想見，這些滾進賭商袋裏的巨重禮物，自然是大部份從富商和過氣的官僚的手裏一批一批的送去的、假如他們那能拿卜賭注和去嫖賭的精神和勇氣去購買救國公債、香港　·門的公債銷額，　早就滿額、甚至超過任何地方的成績了．爲甚麼不這樣做呀，究竟是缺乏國家民族的觀念呢，還是應了「貨悖而奢，亦悖而出」　句老話啊！</p>
<p>救亡的工作</p>
<p>救亡的工作在澳門發展的程度怎樣？這是我們每個人都能够想像得到的；更因爲富局對這種工作的進展異常留意，有　時些工作都沒辦法去做。記者　找澳中唯一的救亡團體女慰勞分　，探訪他們的工作情形，但跑了半大，問過很多人　找着。你道這　會設在什麼　方，原　在一家舊　的大夏裏面，在屋角掛着一塊小牌，寫着澳門婦女慰勞分會，僑是不下—二分的精神，一定有不見的·其他的當然更難找了—談到聯絡，更是隔撓，所以一切工作比起查港這邊來是差　遠了！</p>
<p>奇怪的標語</p>
<p>隨着救亡工作沒多大發展，那裏還有很多奇異的情形，在大街上走着，時時　極着某國人軒然昻然地走着，衣服面貌，都　類我們的同胞·祇是言語跟行動差一點，其餘有很多時　，僑　都相屬按道的去有「×××的樓船」的。</p>
<p>正當汪精衛發表主和　　　，在大街通　中，貼滿了很多「××親善」，「××提携」的標語，途人均好足而觀，後來，一熱心人把它撕毀了，這　一事件，　吿結束·此外還　很多很多怪人怪事想吿訴朋者諸君而沒辦法吿訴的，這當然是一個憾事！</p>
<p>最後，記者雖　在澳門停留的時間很少，但半時耳聞的事，完全目覩了，這自然是有無限的高興，同時也覺得　限的悲傷啊！</p>

<h3 id="c19">一九三八年日本「文壇」 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 赤槐</p>
<p>用「文壇」二字來形容一九三八年的日本文學界的動態，實在是不配的。今日的日本只有法西斯蒂軍人的「擂台」，失去了自由意志的日本文人，所謂，『文壇』云云，充其量，也不過在「擂台」上所演場面的一幕而已。日本的批評家們，巳自行承認他們在文學上是敗北的了。但就文學的形式言，文學形式作品的繼續在產生，却仍舊是事實，像火野葦平的『麥與兵隊」，在日本是被認作今年的最大收穫的。而且他們還在誇稱中國的抗戰文學，還沒有這樣『偉大』成績。但『麥與兵隊』的作者是個普通的兵士，如果這種以中國人的血和肉砌成的東西够稱得『偉大』，那麼一切法西斯蒂的歡性文學，都可算是『偉大』的作品。就我們中國人看『麥與兵隊』這本書的能有幾分價　，就是在其骨子裏尙能幾分暴露日軍　　　　　　　　、同時反映着中國軍民在抗戰中所表現的偉大精神。作者的動機却絕非如此，只是他這壹枝筆、尙無力掩蓋盡壹切現實的眞相。</p>
<p>但就日本一般旣成文人的功勳言，其貧乏的情况，殊爲日本文壇史上最黑暗的一個時期。先就主要七種雜誌上所刊載的分量言，則發表作品最多的作家，是和田傳（七篇），其次是兩部知二和德永直（各六　）再次是高見順和間宮茂輔（各五篇），以上各人是今年日本「交壇」上發表作品最多的作家。</p>
<p>以上幾個文人中，德永直的名字在中國是相當熟的。他是老早「轉向」的了，換句話說，也早就墮落的了，所以雖然寫了六篇，其中兩篇却都是寫的自己的回憶，如『技師阿波忠助』和『最初的記憶』·一個文人開始寫自已的囘憶，而目的又非是在暗示時代的轉移意義，那就是表示這文人的文才已趨退潮，回憶是他最後的影子，不久就連這種影子也將歸於消滅。據說德永直因時局的關係，已『自行』將他過去的幾本著作絕版</p>
<p>其次是阿部知二，在中國人中間恐怕不如德永直的有聲名，他今年也發表了六篇作品。據窪川鶴次郎的評語，尙不能和德永直的相比，多數都是流行文學的東西，如銷路頗好好的『北京』一書，就是江湖文學一例。</p>
<p>高見顧的作品恐怕在中國還沒有介紹過。他是一二年前的新露頭角的流行作家，可是今年他的作品却受到了激烈的攻擊，例如在『日本評論』月號所發衣的「盛場』，竟被川端康成評爲意外的惡作。而據窪川鶴次郎的評語，也認爲他今年所寫的作品，確都是不能上眼的東西。</p>
<p>再次如丹羽文　和武田麟太郎，兩人均不過發表了三篇東西，丹羽的三篇是「被毆的情人」（「日本評論」一月號），那是寫愛護的東西，其次是「妻　作品」（「改造」三月號），及『自己的事』（『日本評論』六月號）。後者兩篇　說是有新的作風。武田的三篇是『井原西鶴』（文藝七月號），『眼鏡』，（『文學界』—月號）『朝之草』『中央公論六月號）我們不必怎樣仔　審究這些作品生內容，只要看有這篇作品的題目，就可以推知一個大槪情形·而事實上篇篇的題都不外是個人纖感情的抒發（在允許抒發的範圍內）沒有一篇　反映日本的現實生活的。但就　種文學動態的整個現象言，却最明自的反映了今日日本國內的文壇實情—貧乏，空虛，墮落和黑暗。</p>
<p>以上所述，雖不能句括盡日本全部的『文壇』現狀，但幾　較知名的文人旣然如此，則已可槪見其一班。所謂『文壇的底流』，實　僅是喘息在軍事法西期蒂重壓下的一條陰溝而已。</p>

<p>— 杜埃</p>
<p>體到你死的消息，朋友們都啞然的瞠目起來，不可抗拒的悲哀，把你的在活着的朋友們，都壓得　頭了。</p>
<p>在沉默的哀思裏。我就想起了你在港時度一切。我將永不能忘記的，一個矮小的身軀。一副寡言的沉着的面龐。你好像是單純的沉默的人，在表面上很缺乏熱情·但是，蘊藏在你底心裏的，每一個細胞裏的，却是樸實的友愛，和高度的工作情緒，祗要你認爲應該做的，沒有不切切實實幹完它。你對於「事業」的負責，是値得每，年靑的人們　習·但你最大的優點，是表現於工作中的積極性和自覺性。就拿你的私生活來看，也足爲年靑人的模範，簡單，樸實，沒有一點不好的嗜好，你在過着，如無數靑年一樣的過着：廿世紀四十年代的中國人底最淸苦而又最富於朝氣的生活，什麼東西也不能沾染你，什麼東西也不能阻撓你，你在不斷地用沉着的步武，把一切因襲的觀念，和腐敗的誘惑，排除了，漸次的克服了。你在任何一個場合裏，都不急燥，耶慶是碰到一件十分麻煩的事情，你也不急燥的·但你却勇於負責。你不如其些人那樣的輕率，自大；也不如某此人那樣的只說話，不做事，但你也有缺點，那就是當必須說話的時候，說得那樣的少。你那少說話的脾氣，也許有些人會把你看成　傲的。其實，你一點也不·你有着强烈的正義感，你不寬許一切的腐敗和醜惡，但你却寬恕愚昧的不幸底人羣，付以深湛的憐憫和熾熱的愛情。</p>
<p>當你隨着服務團向西江出發的那天，我們馬上感到缺少了一件什麼東西似的。然而，你的離開，不是爲了別的，却是爲了祖國的解放·這使我們不會宛惜的·到了去年上月初的時候，從你的來信裏知道你底工作有了極大的開展，你在負担舊幾千個自衛團團員的敎育工作會連連地來信要求藝協動員會員回去協助工作，但是，我們底動員計劃還未實現，而你底死訊傳來了·啊啊！你在敵機的轟炸下，竟這樣的就死去了。</p>
<p>雖然你這樣的就死去了，但你是帶着光榮死去的，如今，你在安息，但死者却也更昂揚地踏上了你底未完的路。祖國今天正以空前的進步。堅持抗戰，我們的解放事業正轉人一新的階段，雖然，剛在這時候，汪精衛　變了，但抗戰陣綫却更加堅强起來，安息　！你底光榮與民族的光榮一樣萬年不杇的。</p>
<h3 id="c21">張曙之死 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 殊倫</p>
<p>在聶耳死去的時候，陶行知在一篇文章里這樣地悼惜過：</p>
<p>，『聶耳先生之死是中國大衆音樂的一個最大損失，幾乎是等於音樂之國里失悼一個東北，東北可以收囘，聶耳不能復活！』</p>
<p>聶耳先生之死，我們永遠銘記營。</p>
<p>三年之後，承繼着聶耳遺志的大衆歌曲作家之一的張曙先生也死十×人炸彈之下，我們所感到的卽是一個偉大的損失，幷且在心頭上加深了一種對×人摧殘文化莫大的憎恨。</p>
<p>我們承認聶耳是中國新音樂最有力的策動者，奠基者，聶耳死後，一大羣新音樂工作者，支持着他的遺志，這其中——星海，呂驥，孫愼，賀綠汀，塞克，麥新，沙梅，雪廠，張曙都是不斷的創作着，生產着，磨練着他們鬥爭的武器，向全中國千千萬萬　自不同階層的羣衆宣揚着，呼召着，敎育着，武裝着。他們給與了全中國的人民以一種共同的活底呼叫！</p>
<p>在新音樂運動發展過程當中，誰都發生了一個共同的感覺，　就　爲勞苦大衆而創作的歌曲，無論在實和量都呈現得非常貧乏，不够力，不够用，不够俗與不能達到口語化。不能傳達出勞苦大衆的生活的感情，這使得新音樂運動永久停留在一個階稈上，還沒有達到廣泛的大衆化。</p>
<p>這原因，一方面是由於大衆歌曲製作的不容易，正如。陶行知先生所提示的：一個脫離了大衆生活的天才决寫不出大衆的歌曲來。」由此可知大衆歌曲是從大衆層中的生活過濾與滲透出來的，基於此，要產生眞正的大衆樂曲，不須先有無數參與和熟透，然苦人衆生活的作曲家。</p>
<p>其次，中國新音樂運動雖然隨伴　抗戰的進展而進展着，但它的發展還遠未達到成熟的地步，這是整个進步的現象，然面也是整個的作曲者還將在抗戰的火血中成功起來。</p>
<p>不過，對於張曙先生，這努力的聲樂研究者，進　的作曲家的死，我却付以很大的痛惜與同情。這些年來，張曙先生對於大衆歌曲從事了不息的勞作。生產了車夭曲，築堤歌，救災歌，生活敎育歌，保衛華北，在綠星旗下諸名　。</p>
<p>這些歌曲，是力之流，活底呼叫，中國人民共同的心底共鳴。</p>
<p>然而，張　死了，他沒有死在前線，却死在×人的炸彈下，因爲半中國一人民都是×人殺害的目的物。</p>
<p>張曙死了，可是，他死得一點遺感也沒有，他使用他自己創造出來的音樂打擊過敵人，法西斯的會子手。</p>
<p>無數　靑的後一代的人衆的音樂家會跟着起來的。</p>
<h3 id="c22">一九三八年的文藝評論界 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>文學理論的根本問題方面，除了單行本不計外，今年以李南桌先生發表意見最多。他在『文藝陣地』先後發表『關於文藝大衆化』，『廣現實主義』，『再廣現實主義』，「論『差不多』和『差得多』」和「論典型」等論文·除第一篇和利用舊形式一問題有關外，其餘都是文學理論上的基本問題。</p>
<p>我們在上面　經略爲分析過，一年來家作家們的創作之所以不大爲人滿意，主要原因，就是在乎作家對於現實主義的創作方法的把握之不深入，因之，對于現實的本質，對于主觀的能力與作家的個性，對于人物性格的把握，部很浮泛。這產生出來的必然結果，就正如上述茅盾先生所指示的一樣。李先生的幾篇論文，雖然還有點示『書生氣』，除了批評過曹禺先生的『原野』外，只是『純理論』地闡揚邇些文學理論上的基本問題。但李先生的發言，也是針對着時弊。所以我們認爲他的功績是很大的。</p>
<p>李先生的『廣實現主義』，是針對狹隘的現實主義；『論『差不多』與『差得多』，是討論客觀的現實與主觀的能力問題·幾年來，文壇上都鬧　『不多主義』『千篇一律主義」的論爭。甚至還有些別具心肺的人，藉差不多與千篇一律來攻擊新文學，有些人更滑稽，他們認爲科事已發達到現在這樣高的階段，使人的認識方法趨于一致化了，因之大家所認識的客觀事物，無不相同。作品也就無法不「差不多」了。但我們不以爲這樣·對于認識方法的科學化，從而對于客觀事象的認識的一致化，對于這點，我們是同意的。然而，「人之不同各如其面』，作品之不同，也各如其作家之面。這不是笑話，這正是那些滑稽的膚淺『理論家』所忽視，或者是所不懂的一點。試問，曾有那一個讀者，感覺到魯迅，郭沬若，茅盾三先生的作品是差不多的呢？無論在內容上，方法上·又，作家儖管去學杜斯托也夫斯基，托爾斯泰，巴爾扎克，狄更斯，或高爾基，蕭洛霍夫，而受其影響，但從無一個作家學得十全十足。這不僅是作家的學習能力問題，更其有作家個性問題存在。托爾斯泰在未發表的死前日記裏曾說過，最無聊的事，莫過於讀沒有灌注着作家自己的思想和個性的作品。這正是道破着這個問題。我們再反問；爲什麼同是以八百壯十或台兒莊大勝爲題材的許多作品，並非篇篇一樣？爲什巴金　生的作品富于熱情，老舍先生的作品充滿幽默呢？這是因爲一個作品的產生，它的內容雖然是在作家的認職，也許是『差不多』的客觀現實，但是這被認職，不是像照相一樣，直接照樣複寫出來。是經過作家的藝術概括的過程，滲　作家自己的思想，心理，感情和個性的成分進去，這就成了各個作家的作品都有自己的特色的事實。所以李先生論『差不多』與『差得多』一文裏的結論說：</p>
<p>『在文藝作品當中有些地方是應該『差不多』的，那是眞理的所在，那些地方是應該『人同此心，心同此理』的。</p>
<p>『但是另外的正和這一面相對的作家的個性在作品中的表現，却不應該『差不多，應該『差得多』。『差得』和作家個性間彼此差異一般『多』—（見『文陣』一卷六期）</p>
<p>『論典型』一文，作者是認爲『人性』，『類型性』，『個性』這三要素的總和，再加入時間的要素，能動的人物，才配稱做『典型』。作者在此篇中引用了許多高爾基論典型創造的話，這些，國內已有許多人的譯文，故這裏不絮再論。</p>
<p>最後，我們謹以—二萬分熱忱向李先生表示哀悼，因爲他于于今年十月十四日（？）逝世了。</p>
<p>魯迅研究方面，今年也有很大的收穫</p>
<p>魯迅先生是我國新女學的創造者，是我國革命文學運動的導師，他的全部遺產。光耀地指示着找國新文學發展的前途。對他的遺產，對他們的偉大研究的精神的發揚光大，正是給我們抗戰文藝以新鮮的滋養。</p>
<p>在魯迅先生逝世二週年紀念中，除了爲我國出版界空前盛舉的魯迅全集，在蔡元培，胡愈之，茅盾，巴金等先生的共同努力之下，得以完成外，『文藝陣地』第二卷第一期也出了『紀念特輯』，此外有一本單行本式的綜台雜誌名「思想家的魯迅」，頭一篇文章就是「思想家的魯迅」，凡數萬言，對于魯迅先生的思想——它的成長，發展，成熟，給以系統的研究，正確的闡揚。這篇文章，和『文』的『特輯』裏王任叔先生的『魯迅先生的藝術觀』合併起來讀，更有益。尤其値得珍貴的，是「特輯』裏的魯迅夫人許景宋女士所寫的長文『魯迅和靑年們』用最忠實的筆法，將魯迅先生後半世的生活，對靑年們的熱心的愛護和指導，對社會污濁罪惡的激烈的憎悵與反抗等等，極深刻地表現了出來。在完全的令人滿意的魯迅傳沒有出來以前，這可以當爲魯迅傳讀·此外，『特輯』裏的『魯迅的輯佚工作』，也說明了魯迅先生的事業的另一面，可供參考。其他零碎文章，或我所看不到的，從略了。（完）</p>

<p>在運　的時候、切勿停止呼吸、並且還要使呼作用與動作相稱或調和吸、否則身體將受這大的損害、尤以心肺兩部爲最甚、</p>
<p>關於深呼吸的方法、最重要的有下列五點、一（一）、用鼻氣呼吸孔氣用口、（二）吸氣時腹部盡量漲大、呼氣腹部盡　縮小、（三）吸氣時全身肌肉皆須鬆弛、不可用力，姿勢要自然、（四）呼氣時兩臂相交於胸前、　力　　將胸部壓縮、使肺中空氣書量澈底排出、(五）不可迎風呼吸、（六）每次行深呼吸以五分鐘爲最適宜、</p>
<p>此外尙有兩種呼吸運動對於呼吸系統特別有益，茲將其略述於下、</p>
<p>（一）嘴唇緊收、祗留，小孔、風吹笛時口部之姿勢相似，但與　口　不同、　後　將空氣呼入、及至肺部充滿空氣爲止、吸氣時嘴唇不必緊收、普通深呼吸法相向、如用鼻孔　亦可、須用手指將其遮蓋、祇留一小孔、注意吸氣時須用力、呼吸務須深長、</p>
<p>（二）與前運動相反、則將空氣由鼻孔或嘴唇段留之小孔徐徐呼出、氣時則與普通深呼吸法相同、</p>
<p>這兩個呼吸動最好行於運之　、或運動之間並應與普通的　呼吸法分替而行、叩先行這種運動三次、後繼續反覆而行約三四分鐘。（下）</p>

<p>— 球場舊侶</p>
<p>憶不佞自南服回港之初，行裝甫卸，卽有請重事紛</p>
<p>以言體育之事者，不佞以遠游多年，久未涉獵於是間球事，新進者且多未謀面，則何有於技術之批評，逐未教貿然作馮婦，然而每披　報章體育欄，知此調乃未減往時之盛，以比不佞離此北上時，目有過之無不及，不禁心然嚮往，由是詣賽塲，作壁上之收賞，不謂目之所見，乃覺今之足　人物之造詣，大　遠不如昔也，時以無評球之職守，私意對而自知　。未嘗以吿別人焉。</p>
<p>於某次參觀中西劇　之中·鄰而坐者適爲舊雨郭晏波君·（君爲南華會　助，因力但體育，幾破其產，本港華僑足球技術克臻今日之盛，微君當日之悉力以赴恐莫能致，其功績暇當爲文紀之，聊誌景仰。（列坐於後者則某著名球人與二三熱中體育之　也。乃在賽事正烈之某種失意之一煞那間，郭君忽顧不佞而言曰，以子之所見，則今日我球人之技，以比往—年爲何如耶？有否　化之象徵？不佞　之作會心之微笑，不禁點首表同情者再。</p>
<p>不謂座後之　人聞言，竟慍然而言曰，今之吾人球　退化耶？以事實言，則成績之佳，遠非往時所得而有也不觀乎『雛　』賽球之速度與脚頭之爽採。又豈前輩所得而　見哉，言下復引得獎成績以爲證，（當時南華華所向址靡，華聯隊每出。亦英勇莫當。）傍　人而坐者復多韙其言，郭君與不佞以爲曲歌相寡，不應與爲口舌之爭，則惟有相視作會心之苦笑，緘口不復再言。</p>
<p>自時　後，南華一帆順風·榮膺聯賽冠軍銜，特別銀牌之賽，南華兄弟班又復橫掃諸軍，相與得决賽權，不甯唯是，香港之足球甲組錦標，爲數僅六，華隊乃併得其五，餘麗華獎杯，亦得决賽之權，徒以當時高手未盡出場，遂屈居亞軍而已；不佞爲事實所惑，幾以爲目光退化，而致疑於一已今茲之觀察爲有誤也。</p>
<p>因衣食所驅，不得已而重作評球馮婦以後，卽不能不於球事更加以細意之觀察則更感我　僑之所以能突奪多標，實非球藝之有進，乃西隊人才零落故然，及見　靈登與南坼兩球隊之來賽，兩俱幾於　掃香江而後去，遂益知己見爲非謬，然而港人則又曰，哥靈登國之勁旅也，南坼隊亦有長足之進步，非復吳下阿蒙，不佞以未嘗一覩英國球藝之果何若，　靈登而非　國名班，特耳食而知耳，卽南坼隊往日之造詣如何，亦未嘗目見，今以謂港人　藝退化故敗，而非由於來者之特强，則苦　無左證，亦惟有人云亦云日，事　然，來隊力强，是以最强之　華，亦僅能一敗一和於哥靈登，又僅一和而一次僅勝南胡　也。</p>
<p>然而觀港人足球之演出，久久仍覺遠未如國隊二次游澳大利亞洲歸來時也，不獲不能如二次漫游澳大利亞洲歸來時。即球員之一部，分裂以另組中華體育會時期之當日南華隊之球術，亦似有未如也，但事證何在耶？雖欲有所言以促球人之覺悟而仍有所未　，則惟有茹而不吐身：茹而未吐，如梗在喉甚以爲苦焉，因力求所以能證其說之事實，以求有發表鄙見之一日，</p>
<p>南華歡宴哥靈登隊之夕，不佞叨陪末座，得與某海軍賽　者攀談，因詢其對哥靈登　術作何批評，據　亦佳，然未臻其祖國稱强之水準，旬　其祖國之海軍選隊，常被擊至片碎，不佞誅彼言中有物，因　同是海軍選隊也，何如英國者獨强？其人曰，英國海陸軍年必有足球人比賽，故兩方士兵之極能於玩球者。必留國侍用，不輕於外調，是以獨强，今之來港海陸軍，不獨遠比留英者之球齡弱，卽以比前者港中區區一襤或一營之選手亦或較爲遜色，蓋前此海陸軍部未有擇留足球能手以駐於國之動機也，不佞聞是不禁有悟，因更肯定此爲港人足球技術水準低落之一証、然此亦耳食之言耳？或尙未足以平今之球人自大之心。旣不能平其自大之心而促之求進步，則爲言適足以傷其觀感而巳，於事無補，於是仍隱而勿言。</p>
<p>今者李惠堂，吿也奴，比路登（Beltroa有照英式調音而譯作日路度者，其　照葡國昔以譯則斯爲近。）利美度士（亦有照滬譯作雷米迪者，此子壯年待乃本港中著名前衛，曾膺埠際代表之選，當日蜚聲於西洋會球隊時，不佞嘗照粵昔譯法以上四字名其人，今想人偤有憶及者。）等復出，不佞隊得有本港足球技術水準低落之鐵証而發爲期文矣。</p>
<p>李惠堂與大吿山奴，固吾人所認爲一個時期之港中絕妙足　前鋒才也，然而在二者之壯年期間，雖任聲勢赫維之時，固未常排於每賽必能建功者也，今則此二君者，雖未得云老，然已喪失其賽球之黃金年齡，若自今細察兩者之演出，則跑步盤球，均有遜當年也，乃常年之未必每賽建功者，今在爲藝已遜時期，乃獨能窺　以雄，賽必得功以還，目不止一賽一射而數數射，功蓋其　也；以此爲例，則今之守衛者抱藝爲較遜前人，不已昭然如揭乎？</p>
<p>比路登（比路度）固曾蜚聲球國爲勇前衛，惟以比當時中華之林玉英，梁玉堂，南華之黃美順，九龍之福士，麥基路肥未如也，乃昔在盛時之未超塵脫俗者，今在吿休已久年齒加長之時，乃能一出而維視儕輩，則其能如　者，豈有仙術？無亦今之球人爲熱遠勝昔時，兩相比較，遂若未如垂垂老去之重來崔　然耳。</p>
<p>至於利美度士（雷米迪），前在全盛時期，亦前衛才已耳，尙憶西祥　一次因勇將多傷，改用彼當內衛則大敗，是當時之　美度士而當內衛，爲藝且比平平無奇之西洋會後內衛爲未如，若以比當年之霎氏，陳　，吳錦泉，黎郁達輩，更不足以望人項背；然而今者祇於馬齒徒增之年，出當右內衛，乃又有憂憂獨造之勢，則若而人者，又豈突爾而　仙山學得內衛術耶？毋亦今之前　少良材，相形之下，遂覺其獨妙而已。</p>

<p>日本內閣　在昨天（五日）正式組成了。今日的問題是：近衛內閣爲什摩終於崩潰？現在這個平沼內閣的組成又有什麼意義？今後日本將向何處去？對於中國和世界將有什麼影響？</p>
<p>近衛內閣原是軍閥財閥臺體內閣，其任務是由發動及支持大現模侵華軍事開始，奠立法西斯侵略者的遠衆霸權。但是這個內閣在中國堅持持久抗戰的前面碰了壁，他的『速戰速决』戰略不能實現，國內財政的危機　在國際日陷孤立，更使近衛內閣不能完成其任務。勉強支　到今日，一方面因中國的愈戰　勇，决不妥協，注精的投降政策，完全破　，另方面因央美反日援華態度愈加積極，日本在國際形琳愈感　立，再加上日本本身困難的激化，如總動員法案及龐人預算案的難關不易渡過，由於這種種因素，暴露了近衛內閣巳經喪失完成其任務的能力。</p>
<p>平沼新內閣的產生·便是想藉更張有力的政權，以解除其內部的困難，而以「一新局面」的招牌，來挽救日本在國際將陷末路的命運·拭一險閱平沼新閣陣容，即可發出可爲上列論證的兩個特點：第一是自首相平沼以下，全部閣員，都是更接近法西斯軍　或衹爲軍　　策的人物，不是所　使軍事財政外交更加團稱，也就是使這三者更緊密控制在法西斯軍　的手中，以便進有邃無前途的戰爭。第二是內相末次的下合，民政黨總裁町與田政友會分子前日拉閣，以及外相有田的　連，藏次石原的　正，這充分表露其緩和內部不安與國際孤立的意圓。</p>
<p>然而日本統治者　『更引』將依然成爲徒勞，因爲平沼坐閣的主要任務依然是完成『征服中國』及『奠定東亞秩序』，爲要完成這一任務，即對外固然不能不繼績加强與德意的勾結，和實際上必然使其與央美之蘇　國衝突更加嚴重，對內亦不能不　暴力通過龐，預算案及實施總動員法全部，因此又將加深其財政危機以及激化人民反戰運動，何况中國抵抗的力　日益發展與國形勢益見對日不利呢！然而日本統治者這一更張，對世界和平與民主，顯爲　狂妄的威脅，它將使日本人民受更大的刦難，它將使中國及和平民主各國益堅其反侵略的决心。</p>

<p>本屆日本內閣、有兩大特　、其一、兼任者甚多、可知其組織之匆促、其二、不少閣員屬二流以下人物、不得不稱之爲一弱體內閣」、茲誌平沼等略歷如次：</p>
<p>首相平沼</p>
<p>岡山縣人、現年七十三歲、爲一　夫、一八八九年東京帝大法學部英法科畢業後卽入司法省任職、一九一一年任司法次官、旋歷任檢事總長、大審院長、一九二三年任第二次由本內閣之司　大臣、一九二四年任　密院顧問官、一九二五年任樞密院副議長兼任皇室制度審查委員，並授男爵、至一九三六年升任樞密院　長、以至今日、平沼原爲有名的日本法西斯團體國本社領袖、爲衆所知、國本社脫胎於東京　大內反　團體之興國同志會、該會成立于一九二〇年、翌年卽　平沼爲顧問、一九二四年半沼卸任法相後、即組織此所謂『精神的敎化團體」之國本社、平沼曾自　　不信仰法西斯主義、但國本社爲日本重要法西斯團體之、却爲鐵的車實、當時與國本社有關者、句括軍部、官僚、財關各方面之重要人物、如東鄕平八郎、齋籐實、宇垣一成、加籐寬　、大角岑生、荒木貞夫、眞崎甚三郎、小磯國昭、秦眞次、松井石根、水田鐵山、　籐　夫、田邊治通、池田成彬、結城豐太郎等均支持之，故平沼之潛勢力　當大、而　次內閣改組、皆有呼聲、但正因關係太繁雜、往往弄得多方面不討好、以致平沼數次不能出山、二二六事件日本政局大變、平沼于獲得機密院議畏後、即辭去國本社社長之職、旋卽宣吿　散國本社、以職位關係、近來平沼對于法西斯活動、　稍會沉前、</p>
<p>此次平沼得乘各　矛盾對立中上台、固可一過首相之癮、然前途實難樂觀、壽命必短、老奸巨滑的平沼、雖各方面皆有連繫、但各　面對他均無—分好感、現口暫時　他過波而已、蓋軍部法西斯以平沼難爲老牌　西斯戶頭、但並不是一个純粹行動主義者、年來與元老重臣官僚等結托過密、自身亦深染官僚氣、甚爲少壯法西斯分子所不悅、同　、政黨財閥則以平沼爲法西斯領袖、相當討　他、且看平沼如何處　這樣複雜的日本政局製、</p>
<p>鐵相前田</p>
<p>和歌山縣人、年五十八歲、東京法學院畢　、會業律師、一九　一年任犬養內閣之商工大臣、一九三六年任廣田內閣之鐵　大臣、一九三七年任內閣參議、直至現在、此次係第二度出任鐵道大臣、前田爲政友會中的重豐分子、歷任該黨總務、幹事長等要職、現爲代行委員之一、其人具有相當政治手腕、　未說黨、但接近軍部法西斯、在新黨運動中甚爲活躍、主塲棄旣成政黨、最近政　會中中島派與鳩山派之爭、前　傾向于中島，實際亦一法西斯的御用者、</p>
<p>農相町田</p>
<p>秋田縣人、年七十七歲、政界元老、一九一五年任農商務省參政官、一九二五年第一次若槻內閣、一九二九年濱口內閣、一九三一年第二次若組內閣、町田均任農林大臣、一九三四年任岡田內閣之商工大臣、二二六事變高橋相被殺、氏曾暫　藏相數天、一九三七年秋內閣參制成立、就任內閣參議、直至現在、此次爲第四度出任農林大臣、町田爲民政黨領袖、任該黨總裁已多年、現尙在職、氏又具理財手腕、原爲山。財閥之要員、</p>
<p>藏相石渡</p>
<p>東京人、現年西十八歲、東京帝大英法科畢業，歷任閣內賞勳局調查官、大藏主省計局長、大藏次官等職、前賀屋藏相及剛卸任之池田藏相時　、兩任大藏次官卽爲石彼、其人具有編製預算　之特殊能力、歷次預算、氏均參與編、近年龐人軍事預算、氏且皆屬言編、爲一財政技術家、與賀屋相似、氏在財政經濟界中、本未有若何勢力、但　一親軍的少壯財政官僚、故此次得出任藏相要職、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c48">抗戰建國中之地方長官 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>抗戰建國之成功，與地方政治機構之健全，有不可分離之關係。頻聞各省區地方政府將有若干更張，其故當亦在此。近頃旣經先後見諸事實者：西康特區改建省治，而以劉文輝氏爲省政府主席，李漢魂氏繼吳鐵城氏爲廣東省政府主席；比外尙有某省某氏，某氏某省之說，或非無因。</p>
<p>任何國家機構之中，地方長官因時調動，原屬行政之常經，初不必特殊之原因，亦卽非意外之變故。顧於中國，一般人士對於此類事，猶多作逾度之注意者：殆因地方各級公務人員之黜陟進退，未入常軌，輒以長官之更迭而演爲宦海升沉之微波，轉展影響，所及遂廣；復因早年割據狀熊尙未剷除之際，主政省區，儼然封建，其人權位之得失，卽是勢力之消長，及今國政之統一雖已完成，而民間尙有狃於傳統觀念而不自覺者。因是之故，凡關此類人事問題，每爲一般興趣所鍾，視聽所集，欣欣樂道焉：是亦所謂可以已而不已者歟。雖然，負方面之任者，固中央與地方之間居樞紐也；國家法政之暢行與否？功令之獲效與否？其有應省自爲政，因地制宜者，得當與否？爲國政，爲省政，必不免於利弊相伴，得失互見者，其利弊得失之分，有接影響及於民間而逈殊其爲禍爲福之成分，是尤繫於省政之得人與否？得法與否？平時然，在抗戰建國之非常時期尤然。頗聞半載之前，國民政府屢以各種方式，指示各省區，日黨政軍，務一體也：日戰時之凡百，務以軍事爲主也；更復內定地方長官人選之原則，曰凡在戰區，務任使軍人也；因時制宜，自應爾爾。故當時不合人選原則之省分，一律改弦更張，惟黔粤以離前綫較遠，斯爲例外；及今戰於嶺南，乃畀李漢魂氏以重任，李氏固才識卓越，佼佼儒將也。</p>
<p>在此若干省府已經改組之時，若干省府亦傳改組之日，竊願爲吾中央獻言者：抗戰建國，當然由中央提綱絜領，統盤運籌，然士氣民心·人力物力，必然以地方爲源泉；故今後更應視地方爲抗戰建國之根本，以地方之政績爲檢討國政之主要對象。良以國家之政事軍事，祇有局部至善而全部未至善者，絕對無全部巳至善而局部尙未至善者。近年中國，進步極多極速；顧以得力於蔣委員長之精誠力量者爲最大，故全部與局部之向善程序，不能作合理之平衡進步，不惟形之畸，抑且有倒置之觀；郎氣象之淸明，勞苦之神情，工作之效率，殆皆與蔣委員長距離之遠近成正比例，不若是者，僅爲例外。如此畸形狀態，一方面可爲中華國族獲得超越羣倫之領袖而忻喜，一方面不能不鞭策領袖以次，政治上之各階層，由道德與職堂之責任爲出發點，有痛切之自覺，奮發向善。中央之公務員，輔佐領袖，當然有其莊嚴責任；而地方官獨當方面，負責尤重。是以中央政府之遴選地方長官；應不僅求其能對中央忠實服從，務必求其能力才調，克收實際功績以追隨中央。庶幾可以爲抗戰建國培養宏遠之根本源泉，底定深厚之全部基礎。旣得其人，尤必澈底糾正旣往對於若干省分分割事權分別畀倚之失策；湔底體認黨政軍所以務爲體之絕對必要，予其人以全責全權，俾克充量發揮其能力才調；不若是，更張無益：必若是，始可責以務竟全功。</p>

<h3 id="c53">軍政要人戰局談片　接第八版 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>「不過，我們處在這個戰局轉變的過度時期，象徵中的中國，族解放之新生，正如胎兒之降生還要感到一番必有的困難。換句話說，××强盜之不能一戰而亡我國，但我們也不能很快的就轉弱爲强馬上就將××强盜　出國境。我們祇有堅持長期抗戰，　强國內團結，才是　耶困難，眞正轉入勝利階段的基的方針……」</p>
<p>「報吿：有位客人請見部長—」周先生唯一的隨從副官忽然椎門進來這樣說，同時還　上二張名片。周先生請那位客人進來，他帶着上尉肩章，他說在××軍校肄業時，曾受過周先生的敎育。他現在某部隊服務，準備開往前方，不料廣州失陷，家屬逃難來桂，　餐不繼，特來請周先生帮忙。周先生在××軍校任敎，已經是很早以前的事，對于這泣高足弟子，當然一時記不起來。但　本着「民胞物與」，「有敎無類的精神，先從乞助弟子手中，接過幾張難民証來一看，便誠懇地對那人說：「求助于人，不是根本辦法，你應該叫某某三人去做工，某人去做點小買賣，共同來養活其餘一個老太婆和兩個小孩。」說畢，便慨然解囊，送他三十元錢，叫指定的那個人去做點小買賣，决不可坐吃山空，將錢白白地化了。</p>
<p>我們知道，八路軍將士薪餉，每月除伙食而外，零用錢，十兵僅有兩元，將官有五元。周先生的錢來路不易，正當用途甚多，可於他懇切囑語中，想　得到。然而最要　的意義是，爲人無論處常處變，都貴有自立自助的精神，那個軍官及其家屬。果能體　得透，進而躬行實踐，則其所得實患，將終身受用不了。</p>
<p>接着，周先生就有文壇健將胡愈之先生來訪，陳銘樞先生也派人來請他去談話，於是我只好興辭了。臨別握手，他忽然向我要一本「贛皖湘鄂視察記」，我很詫異怎麼他會　得我五年前出版的這本小册子，當時只好答應以後另行郵寄請敎。</p>
<p>他的那位惟一的隨從副官，年紀不過十五六，待人非常有禮貌。據朋友說：他年紀雖靑，但久經征戰，從實際經驗中，已練得一手好槍法。比力，他要用槍打你的眼睛，子彈就絕不會斜射着你的眉毛或鼻樑。槍法果能如此準確，眞可稱爲一種絕技了！</p>
<p>郭沫若論新階段</p>
<p>郭沬若先生的談話，恰與白崇禧周恩來兩先生互為呼應，如出一脉。對於整個戰局的觀察，他的見解是這樣：</p>
<p>『戰事轉入新階段，我軍政當局，已有適當槽置，决將前一階段所有優點，儘量維持下去，缺點，則嚴予糾正。新階段無可違言，困難很多，但有辦法克服。凡我國民，都應减低生活水準，無論參加抗戰工作與否，無論在前方或方，無論團體生活或私人生活，同樣要盡可能地節己奉公這就是克復困難最切實的初步步驟，同時也是每個人應當做而目做得到的起碼救亡工作</p>
<p>『新階段，×方增加的無限困難，且更甚于我。前階段抗戰×占優勢，以致我們　失了一部份土地和人民；但是我們在上海會戰時，己擊破×人「速戰速決」的夢想，徐州會戰，更毫不容情地粉碎×人「以華制華」的企圖，到了　漢會戰，×人傾　海陸空力量，分路會台進犯，妄想倖獲殲滅剿效果，可是我們又轟轟烈烈地支持了四五個月，使、人海陸空力量大消耗之後，才將武　作有計劃的放集，金甌無恙似的保持住主力，使×人攻進武漢的迷夢——殲滅戰，實際上直等于撲了一　空。</p>
<p>『前一階段的抗戰，我們不但很完美地保持住主力，可以　期支持戰事；另一方面，我們還將華中大江南北的很多民族工廠，安全遷移西南內地，將整　抗戰建國大業中的經濟部門，與政府　本工業互相配合着建立起來，使今後的抗戰資源，有所自出，取之不盡，用之不竭。』</p>
<p>『加以客觀上新階段×人作戰之不便，第二，佔領區愈大，戰綫俞拉長。×人的兵力，便愈不够分配；相反地給予我們乘　攜弱的機會，也就遂漸加多。第二，在我西北西南兩大區　腹地作戰，×人海陸空軍之運用，均受地形上的限制，絕不能如以前在沿海一帶作戰，可以得到交通暢了之便利。幷且以後難找一個如徐州，武漢一樣的中心地，來給他作大規模的會戰；要是有的話，更同樣不能使他僥倖獲得殲滅戰果。至於我們的實力，無論在前綫或×後，到處星羅棋佈，能個別機動作戰，×人想對我們各個擊破，而我亦可各自爲戰，將×人個別解决。照這樣相持局勢，堅强奮鬭一個時期，使我們得儘量利用地形，物產，經濟，政治之特長，增加我們抗戰軍事上無限之力量與優勢，我們便可勝利的轉入第三階段。　卽　×人之時期了！』</p>
<p>之後，郭先生還談了一點日本國內潛伏着的禍機，及國際間對日本不利的情勢。　先生　　是現代文化界的明星，抗戰文學的嚮　，他現在貿然負著高級的政治責任，可是他還非常關心文化事業。關於申報在上海復刊經過，及其港版擴充篇　情形，逐一詳爲詢問，表示高興；並應記者之請，俟公務有暇，决定寫點文章，儘先寄給申報發表。記得抗戰剛開始的時候，郭先生曾在一申上發表了一篇「在轟炸中來去」的大作，今後到了掃蕩×人的時期。也許好再寫篇「轟炸中收復失地」的　？</p>
<p>×人在香港上海一帶，常造謠生事，說我們內部黨派，是怎樣怎樣的磨擦。郭先生聽得這話，當時也有個很輕鬆的解答；他說：『恩愛的夫妻，有時還會吵嘴，黨派有點小磨擦，這有什麼關係。　　在事實上，我們因有蔣先生之賢明領導，抗戰後之各黨派間，就不曾發生過什麼磨擦。今後且因抗戰時期之延長，抗戰責任之加重，各黨派一致需要之團結合作，必然更要增加其精誠稈度。』</p>
<p>此外，另在有三廳一位友人處，聽得某當局宣示新階段抗戰之政　方針，是要在「政治中有軍事」，「精神中有物質」，「民衆重於　兵一的一大前提下，去更團結民力，更愛惜物力，幷安插難民，政治對象在前方，工作開展則在下方。過去頭重底輕的弊病，務須把它矯正過來。同時，我們還要訓練政治幹部人才，限期　年，訓成此　人才×萬，用作扣當新階段政治工作的堅實基礎。</p>
<p>總而言之，我軍政當局，對於新階段抗戰建國的　業，確有新盤計劃，使其順利達到必勝必成之領域。</p>
<p>——爲抗戰而流徙到湘桂車中來的一般乘客們，尤其是那五六個來自江浙及華北失陷區的車　　談到與國家民族存亡有關的戰局問題，當然大家是非常關心的。我因爲被那个富有愛國心的　　，侃侃　述自崇禧先生之演講詞的熱忱所感動，一禮尙往來「，才將周恩來郭沬若諸先生的談話，如前文所述一般的轉吿他們，大家都　雀無聲地傾聽着，有的還發出會心的微笑，於是那輛冷風襲　的膳車，伸刻間，好似就充溢着興奮和樂觀的空氣！</p>
<p>次晨（從桂林出發的第三天）車抵三塘，距與粵　路會合處——衡陽僅—二公里，不知它又在打什麼主意，而在三塘久停不開。我想換換口味，便下車去搭西南運輸公司的汽車。該車係從衡陽江　運汽油到此，另由火車轉運他處，　數十車往返同運數日，迄今尙未，完。雖議戰時一滴油，勝似人身一滴血，但我們對這貨色之充分準備，於此即想見一斑。司機人姓黃，他是南洋粵籍華僑，在南洋向備汽車，習就駕車技術，抗戰軍奧，始約一般華僑愛國同志，設法回國服務，各就所能，司機已一年多，據說，他本人和其他數同志，在南洋做生意所拿月薪，都在百元上下。囘國以後，每人雖僅拿薪卅六元至四十二元，惟其是救國工作，精神上反覺特別高興。</p>
<p>湖南公路兩旁植樹，採取西湖蘇堤辦法，加上生產意義，便是「間　楊柳間柏　」，此時桐葉一落，柳葉發黃，附近偶然點綴上幾樹　楓，恰似一幅天然秋景美畫，汽車從中駛過，看來眞是賞心悅目，不過，枝頭林間，已開出戰時之花，那就是「第×汽車塲」，「第×傷兵醫院」，「行軍修息處」的牌子和箭頭，有時會偷偷地跳　你眼廉，將你的出世幻想拉囘「現實」來。</p>
<p>一會見到了衡陽，暫住城外杏花村。</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>仍在湘桂車中。雨也繼續下着，有時還夾雜着雹點，大如米顆豆，將車廂打得錚琮作響。</p>
<p>車到東安站，卽入湖南境。舉目四望，山勢平和，水田甚多，景象迥異廣西。冷水灘是零陵縣的一個大鎭，也是湘桂路的一個大站，電線經緯如織，民房更聚居成一大片。這里旣是個重鎭，便有漢奸來活動，車到站前數，分鐘，路警還捕到個　綽漢奸；他佩着湘桂路職員冒牌徽章，及藏着其他部隊的符號，還帶有某銀行的支票。因向站上探聽各情，被疑捕獲，一鞠卽供，可謂自投羅網。</p>
<p>又距此不遠的某地，前被×機襲擊，有人先出白巾招展，旋用巾自蒙其口，當被駐軍捕獲，割其兩耳；可是釗了審問時，他抵死不認是漢奸。他說他用白巾蒙口，因見×機中彈胃烟，懊認它在放毒氣，才蒙口防毒的。審問官信以爲眞，向他道歉，幷賠償藥費，將他放了。誰知他已深中×人誘惑之毒，後來他又去幹這勾當，再度被捕。前次旣有割耳爲號，這次×機又未中彈冒煙，不能再惜故推託，當然只好俯首受法。</p>
<p>粵桂邊境，也曾捕獲個漢奸集團，他們是個大規模的北式把戲班，男女一共十餘人；想到華南刺探軍情。地方當局已早得情報，不過抓不着他們的確鑿証據，後來費盡了心思，才從他們要把戲時，用以騎着走鉛絲的那個脚踏獨輪車胎中，檢查出秘密文件，始將此案圓滿解决。</p>
<p>總之，凡當漢奸的，都沒有好下場。做三角五角錢放一次信號的小漢奸固然太不上算；就當能博一官半職的大漢奸，終歸是椿賠本生意。因爲差點兒自己的大本錢——腦袋就要搬家，這還有什麼利益好賺呢？何况，　死狗烹，主子們一時不高興，會也置你於死地，到此地步，這才更是做鬼也難瞑目呢！</p>
<p>到了夜間，這特快車又在一个站上停留下來，一切很安靜，我們好像是住在一間狹長的旅館裏。記者和般乘客們，又隨便談起天來。膳車中有五六　車童，他們都是受過高小或初中敎育，此刻工作完畢，也在看書談話。當中有個比較聰明點的，是從浙贛路調來的，他說他從前曾在浙贛車上認識過我；他問我：昨天西南行營主任白崇禧先生在桂林召集學生演講，去聽了沒有？他說他本人已經去聽了，接着他就將日記簿取出看着，把上面記着的白先生演講詞，從頭重述給我聽了一遍。</p>
<p>白先生演講詞的綱要，首先是解釋全面戰術，謂人無分男女老少，都要踴躍奔赴；地無分東西南北，或前方後方，都要完全發動起來，，直接間接予×方以打擊。在戰塲上，我們不爭「點」與「綫」，而爭「面」。繼復指出此次抗戰的戰略階段，在岳陽失陷前爲第一期，以後爲第二期。在第二期戰爭中，我們要在淪陷區擊破×僞組織，樹立强固政權，實行全面之爭取。必使×人進退失據，遭受拿破崙進攻莫斯科的失敗。</p>
<p>白先生這樣正確重要的演講，不去聽誠然可惜（編者按：本報業已全文阻載）。不過我未去聽的原故，是事先已另有約會，卽去分訪政治部副部長周恩來先生，及該部第三廳廳長沬若先生，其次還要收拾行李，所以他把機會放過了。當然，周郭兩先生的談話，同樣也有發表參証的必要。</p>
<p>周恩來會見記</p>
<p>大家知道，周恩來先生是一手造成國共合作，一致抗日的功臣，同時他又是國際聞名的時代政治家。記者曾先後訪晤過他一次，有一次還有葉劍英先生在場，可惜訪他的人太多，我們就不曾痛痛快快地談上五分鐘的話。準備向他請敎的幾個問題中，僅「現階段的抗戰形勢」一題，承他解答了一部份。</p>
<p>他說：「我們目前的抗戰形勢，誠如蔣委員長所說：「已經進到第二期了。」這樣的分期法，是從戰略上來看的。過去抗戰階段，有將戰事開始，截至南京失守時稱爲第一期，又至徐州失守時爲第二期，武漢失守時爲第三期，這是由戰役上來劃分的，但不如從戰略上來劃分較爲便於應月。以前×人採取速戰速决的戰略，滿想一戰卽使我屈服，接受城下盟，走上亡國路；但是我們十六個月來的抗戰勛績，已經把它這種戰略政略擊得粉碎無餘了。</p>
<p>「×人屢次想引誘我們的兵力，數十師集中一點，如上海，南京，徐州，武漢各次大會戰，×人都不惜付以重大代價，而想殲滅我們的主力；可是各次人會戰的結果，因爲我們能够靈活的配用戰略戰術，以空間換取時間，造下長期抗戰基礎。我們的主力不但决未被它殲滅着，而且還生機决然，蓬蓬勃勃，正在潛滋　長中。我們要使正面防禦保有繼續作戰的部隊，同時後方也能迅速加緊建立新的近代化的國防軍，特別是在戰區×後方，派遣得力部隊，發展廣大的游擊運動，例如華北五省，直到現在，三分之二以上的城市，仍在我們的軍隊和人民的手裏，廣人的民衆被組織起來參加游擊戰爭，許多漢奸維持會被摧毀了，許多漢好首領及僞縣長被刺殺，許多僞軍保安隊反正了，平津人民仍不斷地帮助我們的游擊隊。照這樣情勢繼續發展下去，變×人後方爲前方，發動全面總反攻，不是就得步入勝利之門了麼？</p>

<p>— Chen Zhixiong</p>
<p>Huangping - Guiyang: I got up at 6:00 AM on the 21st of last month because the car was scheduled to leave at 7:30 AM. I quickly bought coffee, meat, and rice wine at the gate to satisfy my hunger. The prices were cheap and the quality was good. This was the only food available for sale in the early morning. If you wanted to buy other kinds of breakfast, there was nowhere to buy them. Soon after departure, we ascended a high mountain. Looking down, people looked like ants. The car arrived at Chongnv and crossed over again. The mountain road was rugged, and the jolts were severe, causing headaches. The car arrived at Mafang and then Huangsi Town. This place is still 99 kilometers away from Guiyang. When the car approached Shaping, the mountain road turned silver-gray. The car crossed Wengcheng Bridge, Gouling, and then climbed the mountain again, passing Longyitang, Mazhipu, Longligu Street, Malu, Nierguan, Huangnishao, Longlibao, and finally reached Tulongguan, only 9 kilometers away from Guiyang. When the car crossed Yugao Bridge, we had reached the outskirts of Guiyang. The scenery outside the city was serene and free from worldly dust. Along the Zhuh River, the mountains were clear and the water was beautiful. The car had just passed Zhongshan Park and arrived at the station. It was already past 3:00 PM. The military police at the station checked very strictly. Even showing a pass was ignored. It was said that they were under orders to open the luggage for inspection before allowing passage. So, I ordered the driver to carry the luggage to the hotel. The daily accommodation cost was $1.20, meals were separate. I had to use a kerosene lamp at night. The owner was from Zhejiang, and the food he prepared was very poor. After a short rest, I went out for a walk. During this extraordinary period, the streets were filled with soldiers. Besides cars, small horses were mostly used to carry goods. The horses seemed to understand human intentions and knew their way. The Zhongshan Road area was the most prosperous. The management of the Guiyang Electric Plant was probably inadequate. The streetlights were dim and lackluster at night. Because of the poor inland transportation, goods were expensive, especially imported goods and daily necessities, which were three or four times more expensive than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The weather today was quite hot. Around 10:00 AM, Mr. Zhang and I went to Yuegong Restaurant for lunch. Then we went to the Commercial Press and the Chung Hwa Book Company to buy books. After that, we went to Datongmen Yumen Road, Gong Road, and reached Guangfo Temple. In front of the temple is Jiaxiu Immortal Pavilion. The four characters were written by a certain Taoist priest. The calligraphy was elegant and leisurely, suspected to be written by an immortal. We sat on the stones in front of the pavilion to rest. Looking far at the mountains, the pavilions and towers were clearly visible, making people linger and reluctant to leave. Then we passed Yu Fu Bridge. There are pavilions on the bridge, with many famous inscriptions.</p>
<p>(1) Water emerges from a jade ring, people walk in a lotus petal.</p>
<p>(2) Misty rain pavilions outside the mountains, books and paintings on the city walls reflected in the water.</p>
<p>(3) The Milky Way floats with clouds, stars cross the water, jade halberds drag rain, geese cross the autumn. (4) Taking a short rest and becoming an immortal, listening to the sound of pearls and orioles, turtle reefs, fish singing, general's pillars, rain pattering.</p>
<p>Arriving suddenly in the city, the dust and noise far away, copper cliffs flanking the reeds and sheng pipes, ancestral halls in the clouds, dew.</p>
<p>After crossing Yufu Bridge and passing through the North Gate, we returned. In the evening, we had dinner at Zhuguang Restaurant and then watched a military movie.</p>
<p>A Trip to Qianling Mountain</p>
<p>The weather today was still very hot. In the afternoon, Mr. Zhang and I took a trip to Qianling Mountain. The mountain is two or three miles west of the city. The mountain road is steep, and it was quite strenuous to climb. After about an hour, we reached the foot of the mountain, as if we had encountered peach blossoms, as the dense shade was distributed, the green leaves were whirling, interspersed with red and purple, which was very pleasing to the eye. We slowly climbed to its peak, and the higher we went, the cooler our mood became, and we could no longer see the sun. First, we went to the Guan Temple and the Washing Bowl Pond, and then we reached the Great Hall of the Great Hero, the atmosphere was gloomy, there were several Buddha statues, tall and majestic, gorgeous and extraordinary, then the mountain road was inclined. When we reached the top of the mountain, we felt exhausted. Then we went down the mountain, walked along the slope, to the ancient Buddha Qilin Cave. There were stalactites at the entrance of the cave, hanging down like a Qilin, hence the name. Due to time constraints, we hurried out and took a car back, and then the lamp was all over the city.</p>
<p>Guiyang - Yongning, I got up at about 5:00 AM on the 26th of last month, because the car left very early. After 11 kilometers, we reached Er. From Guiyang to here, the road was half flat. After that, we reached Goufang, Haozhitang, Xiagaocun, Shoulishan, and Qingzhen. Because the car was moving very fast, there was no time to appreciate the scenery, which was a pity.</p>
<p>The car entered the city, passed through Zhongzheng Road, and then left the city. What we saw along the way was all poor people's areas. After about 42 kilometers, the car arrived at Yalongfeng, which is the place where General Li Zikang, the commander of the 38th Division, died. Soon after, the car arrived at Buyunguan and Pingba County, and then entered the city. There is a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in the city, which is very magnificent. There are few people in the city, only a few dozen families. The car continued to move forward, passing Xiatoupu, Shazishao, Shibanwu, and then to Dashuiqiao. The water under the bridge is very shallow, I don't know where the name Dashui (Big Water) comes from. After 75 kilometers, the car arrived at Daizijie, after 88 kilometers, we arrived at Liangsuosheng, after 95 kilometers, we arrived at Anshun Station. The city is very clean. All guests who want to go to Yongning must prepare food such as head cakes in advance here. There should be enough food prepared on the road, lest the car be delayed on the road. After lunch, the car left Anshun, passed Dashanshao, and arrived at Ning, then entered the city. The car stopped for about ten minutes and then started again. There were many Miao people along the way, with peculiar costumes. After a long time, the car arrived at Guanling and saw a large waterfall, like a large silver pillar pouring into the valley, the sound shaking the mountains. Soon we arrived at Dapotop, Baling, and after the car arrived at Yazi Village, the water in the car tank was exhausted, so the car stopped on the road, and the driver went up the mountain to fetch water. After filling it up, we continued to drive, to Guanlingfang, along the way there were large mountains, and the car was not easy to drive. When we arrived at Shuiningmou, it was already dusk, so we stayed in a traveler's inn. The inn was dirty and unbearable, so we slept with our clothes on.</p>
<p>Yongning - Panxian I got up at dawn on the 27th of last month, because the car was scheduled to leave at 8:05 AM. There were many stones along the mountain, and it was very difficult for the car to drive. Soon we arrived at Xinpu Street, the streets were very stable, there were only twenty or so poor families. After that, it was barren wilderness, and there were no people. Soon we arrived at Panjiang, the color was turbid like mud, and it was poisonous. When the car arrived at the Iron Chain Bridge, all the passengers got off the car. There is a female stone statue next to the bridge, the carving is very exquisite, supported by six iron chains, so it is called Iron Chain Bridge. People walking over it are cautious. Looking at the front of the bridge, the two mountains are thousands of feet high, facing each other, with rivers running through the middle, the scenery is amazing. The car crossed Shanjiang, the terrain was steep and difficult to climb. Looking down at the famous mountain valley from the car, it was unfathomably deep. The car circled continuously on the mountain, and the head was dizzy. After the car traveled two thousand li, we arrived at Shenshuiying. From here we went to Hataizhuang, the characters were written by Mr. Zeng Yangfu, vigorous and powerful. When the car was 233 kilometers away from Guiyang, the situation was extremely dangerous, turning twenty-four times on the high mountain. Or left, or right, or up, or down, circulating back and forth, making people dizzy and frightened. If the driver accidentally turned the corner, he would fall into the abyss. It is said that several accidents have happened to cars in front of them. Now passing by, I am still a little scared in my heart. When we arrived at Shaziling, the water in the car was boiling and could not go forward. The car stopped again, and after adding cold water, it was able to drive again. The car traveled through Bazhu for about three hours before going up the mountain. It can be imagined how high the mountain is. The mountains are rich in coal deposits, and the soil is dark red, suspected to be oxidized or iron. It is a pity that the place is remote and no one is mining. It is a great source of profit, hidden underground, which is a pity. The car traveled about 300 kilometers, arrived at Anpu Peak Temple and reached Sanban Bridge. A clear stream under the bridge, crossed the bridge and went up the mountain, the color of the mountain was like vermilion. The car passed through here, the scenery of Sanbamen was exceptionally elegant, looking at the mountains on the opposite side, or red or green, competing with each other for glory, it was very spectacular. The magnificence of the mountains and rivers is nowhere to be found here. Although there was no danger on the car ride today, climbing this mountain allowed us to appreciate the mountain scenery, and our mood suddenly felt cooler. However, recalling the steepness of today's car ride, it was almost soul-stirring. From Guizhou to Yunnan, this section of the road is the most difficult to drive, because the cars are traveling on cliffs and precipices thousands of feet high. Those who read my book, if they ever find themselves in this situation, will know that my words are not false.</p>
<p>Panxian - Banyi I arrived at Panxian at about 4 or 5 PM yesterday, and immediately ordered the porters to carry the luggage into the city. Passing through Zhongshan County Road, the streets were very dirty. Every time I passed, I covered my nose. Fortunately, we found a hotel on the hill, which was exceptionally dark and cluttered with objects, and the room was full of smoke. But there was no better hotel to be found, so we had to stay here for one night. The same was true of Tongxing Warehouse, just as bad. However, the accommodation and meals were very cheap, only 50 cents for one night and two meals. At night, the citizens came and went endlessly. The mountains were lit up with lights and stalls selling goods, mainly cloth, towels, and odds and ends. The people simply did not know what hygiene was, and their intellectual level was extremely low. They acted without order, far from the New Life Movement. I hope the authorities will pay attention to this. The owner was very kind to the guests. There were still many people smoking opium here. The government should ban it. The car left Panxian at 8:15 AM. Although the road was high in the mountains, it was very flat and not tiring. After the car passed Pingyisuo, the mountain scenery was magnificent and the scenery was pleasant. When we arrived at Jingsheng Pass, the mountain was dangerous. Fortunately, the car was safe and arrived at Banyi at 3:00 PM. After staying in Banyi for three days, we took a car to Yunnan. The road was flat along the way. Because I was tired, I didn't record anything along the way. The car was driving very fast, reaching 60 kilometers per hour. The car was shaking very badly. When we arrived at Huguo Street in Kunming, it was already afternoon. If I have time in the future, I will make a trip to Yunnan to share with my readers.</p>
<p>Chinese men and women returning to their homeland and planning to retreat south in the near future must obtain a passport from the Chinese Consulate General before leaving. The passport fee is $4.56 in Straits currency, plus a Chinese Overseas Registration Certificate for $0.12 in Straits currency. Each person should submit six 4-inch half-length photos. Spouses and children under the age of sixteen can be photographed together on one photo. The passport should be submitted to the local photo bureau (in the Chinese Affairs Department building of the Civil Affairs Secretary Office) for visa endorsement, which costs $6 in Straits currency.</p>
<p>Those who do not have an entry permit can apply for an entry permit from the Immigration Department (in the Chinese Affairs Department building of the Civil Affairs Secretary Office), which costs $5 in Straits currency and also requires two 4-inch photos, to avoid the procedures for new immigrants when coming south in the future. If traveling in the steerage class, a passport and visa are not required, but an entry permit must still be obtained in advance.</p>
<p>When women apply for an entry permit, they must be guaranteed by their father, husband, or senior relatives. Professional women and school teachers should be guaranteed by the employer's store and the school principal.</p>

<p>The Jeliss铎加苏 (Jeliss铎加苏) liner, represented by the Tianxiang 洋行 (Tianxiang Trading Company), departed from Luzon on November 25th of last year, bound for the United States. After several days at sea, it strayed due to heavy fog and ran aground on Huadi Island. Subsequently, a tugboat was dispatched from Hong Kong to rescue it and towed it back to the Kowloon Shipyard for repairs. After half a month, this reporter visited the Kowloon Docks yesterday and saw that the bottom of the ship, cargo hold, engine room, reverse gear, and other parts were still under repair and were expected to be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Italian Postal Ship Company's Gandrosu (干德羅素) departed from Shanghai yesterday for Hong Kong. It is expected to arrive at the Kowloon Warehouse Pier around 6:00 AM this morning and will depart at noon on the same day for Singapore, Mumbai, Colombo, Geneva, and Italy.</p>
<p>The Feidaren (非打倫) liner, represented by the Meizuishi 洋行 (Meizuishi Trading Company), was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Yabao today, but according to the company, the liner will be delayed until the 12th of this month.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Japan's trade control today has practically implemented the so-called "import-export chain system". Anyone wishing to import raw materials must have an export of manufactured goods of equivalent value. Since the outbreak of the war, wheat production in "North China" has plummeted. Coupled with the severe famine in the Northeast and Japan itself, the recent surge in rice prices is particularly indicative of the food panic within the country. Therefore, the export of Japanese flour is invisibly further restricted.</p>
<p>There is an even more significant reason: the large-scale activities of Japanese flour industry capital in China. Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese flour mills have almost entirely shut down or been destroyed by artillery fire. Japanese merchants, backed by their military, have either directly seized undamaged flour mills in the war zone and started operations themselves, or, through threats and inducements, have forced Chinese merchants to start operations under joint management. Some Japanese merchants, also seeking to monopolize the Chinese market, have come to China one after another to establish factories or expand their existing factories in China, greatly increasing production. Therefore, the Chinese-Japanese flour mills in the occupied areas today have almost all been revived in the hands of the Japanese, and are under the control of the three major Japanese flour cartels: "Nippon Flour Milling", "Nissin Flour Milling", and "Nitto Flour Milling", forming such a monopolistic front.</p>
<p>Nippon Flour Milling Co., Ltd. The company currently has 11 flour mills in "North China", with a daily production capacity of 12,000 bags. If combined with the newly established factory in Shanghai, the daily production capacity reaches a huge 14,000 bags. Among them, the sub-company "Sankichi Flour Mill" has three mills. The company directly operates only one mill in Tianjin with a capacity of 1,250 bags. In addition, the other seven mills are Chinese-owned flour mills that are now operated by the company. Therefore, the company's flour mills are densely distributed in Qingdao, Jinan, Tianjin, Jining, Xuzhou, and other places. Recently, Fuxin No. 3 Mill in Shanghai has also fallen into the hands of the company, indicating that the company's power is now extending into the Yangtze River basin.</p>
<p>Nissin Flour Milling Co., Ltd. Currently, the company only has two mills in Jinan and Beiping. The mill in Jinan was forcibly seized from a Chinese-owned flour mill by the Japanese army and is being operated under the so-called "military occupation". The mill in Beiping was acquired from a Chinese-owned flour mill that was in debt. The company is currently looking for factory sites, attempting to participate in the competition to monopolize the Chinese flour market.</p>
<p>Nitto Flour Milling Co., Ltd. The company entered "North China" earlier, but its power is not as great as that of Nippon Flour Milling Co., Ltd. However, recently three Chinese-owned flour mills in the Kaifeng area have been revived under the company's banner. According to the company's plan, it intends to establish its exclusive territory in the flour market along the Pinghan Railway and Shanxi areas.</p>
<p>Judging from the current actions of these three major flour cartels, the Chinese flour market seems to have been properly divided. The Jinpu Railway area and the Yangtze River basin are controlled by Nippon Flour Milling Co., Ltd. The Pinghan Railway area and the west are the operational territory of Nitto Flour Milling Co., Ltd. Nissin Flour Milling Co., Ltd. has a tendency to operate in the Pingsui Railway and Beining Railway areas and to the north.</p>

<h3 id="e7">An Overview of Overseas Chinese Relief Efforts in the Year Since the Start of the War: Notable Achievements in Mobilizing Human and Financial Resources; Hong Kong Chinese Rank Only Fourth or Fifth in Donations <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government recently released a report on overseas Chinese affairs in the year since the start of the war. It provided detailed information on the achievements of overseas Chinese communities in various ports in their patriotic movements, including contributions of manpower, material resources, and financial support. Excerpts are provided below for the reference of the Hong Kong Chinese community, to encourage them to work even harder:</p>
<p>Outbreak of War Fuels Enthusiastic Donations</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident, before the government organized fundraising and before the issuance of national bonds, overseas Chinese already began donating to the war effort. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received its first donation on July 22. From then until August 13, it received 18 donations totaling over 80,000 yuan. Many donations received after August 13 were actually remitted before then. These included 35,200 yuan from Chinese in Vancouver and 71,186 yuan from Chinese in Seattle, all donated between July 7 and August 13. This shows that overseas Chinese donations were not only the most substantial but also the earliest. Their spirit of initiative is commendable, and their foresight is unmatched.</p>
<p>Reaching 80 Million in One Year</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese donations were remitted through various channels. Due to local circumstances, some could only raise relief funds, not direct war donations, and these relief funds were often sent to the Chinese Red Cross. Others were sent through fundraising organizations, such as those affiliated with Kuomintang headquarters or branches, which remitted funds to the central party headquarters. Donations collected by consulates were sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some donations were earmarked for specific purposes, such as aid for wounded soldiers and refugees, which were sent to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Funds for purchasing military supplies were sent to the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of War, or the Aviation Commission. Some donations were sent based on hometown ties, such as Guangdong Chinese remitting funds to the Guangdong provincial government. Funds for national salvation bonds were sent to the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee or designated banks, as stipulated. Many donations were also sent directly to the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is now investigating donations through various fundraising channels. A detailed report of the total amount is expected in the near future. Current estimates suggest that overseas Chinese donations have reached approximately 80 million yuan. While this is an approximate figure, it is likely close to the actual amount. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received donations totaling over 313,000 yuan in various currencies. Additionally, 754,294.97 yuan was originally remitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission but was intercepted by the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee. 290,990.76 yuan was originally remitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission but was transferred to the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee by the Central Bank. 44,140.17 yuan was originally remitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission but was transferred to the Ministry of Finance by the Bank of China. In total, approximately 1.4 million yuan was handled this way.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Ranks Fourth or Fifth</p>
<p>As of May of this year, donations and bond purchases from British Malaya totaled over 24 million yuan, ranking first. However, based on population proportion, the approximately 110,000 Chinese in the Philippines donated and purchased bonds totaling 8 million Philippine pesos, an average of about 80 pesos per person, making them the top donors in the initial stage. Chinese in Australia, the Americas, and elsewhere were also very enthusiastic. (Note: Hong Kong Chinese donations rank only fourth or fifth.) This shows that overseas Chinese everywhere are enthusiastic, with any differences due to varying circumstances. Regular, systematic, and planned donations are now being conducted everywhere, with impressive results. Singapore's regular monthly donation method is based on existing hometown organizations, dividing donors into six groups: Hokkien, Cantonese, Chaozhou, Hakka, Hainanese, and Ningbo, each responsible for fundraising. Additionally, a percentage is levied on each unit of production of Chinese-run businesses, generating over 1.5 million yuan monthly. The Philippines' regular monthly donation program was initiated and managed by the Philippine Chinese Aid to Resist × Committee in March of this year.</p>
<p>Economic Sanctions: Hitting the × People</p>
<p>The foundation for a sustained war of resistance lies in a sound and solid economic foundation. The active aspect of implementation lies in economic construction, while the passive aspect lies in inflicting economic blows on the × people. Overseas Chinese are particularly well-suited for this special task, as they are spread throughout the world and mostly operate as retailers. If they unite to boycott × goods, Japan's international trade will suffer a major blow. The effectiveness of overseas Chinese economic sanctions against Japan over the past year has been significant. Reports on Japanese imports in the Nanyang region (where most Chinese reside) and statistics on exports from the × Ministry of Finance to Nanyang demonstrate the impact of overseas Chinese economic sanctions. In addition to boycotting goods, blocking raw materials to Japan is also a key task. The × people rely heavily on raw materials from Nanyang, with iron ore from Malaya being particularly important. Before the war, × × annually obtained over 1.5 million tons of iron ore from Malaya. After the start of the war, Chinese workers at × × mines in various parts of Johor went on strike, followed by workers in other regions like Kuantan and Johor Bahru. As a result, almost all × × mines shut down, reducing monthly iron ore shipments to Japan by over 90%.</p>
<p>Mobilization of Manpower and Resources</p>
<p>The mobilization of manpower and resources is a complex issue that cannot be fully described. At the beginning of the war, thousands of overseas Chinese clamored to return to China to fight against the ×. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission recognized and praised their patriotic aspirations, but also considered the potential drawbacks. It believed that overseas Chinese could best contribute by providing financial support. Instead of abandoning their hard-earned jobs to engage in unskilled military service, they should focus on their strengths. It communicated this policy to overseas Chinese communities, urging them to prioritize production and take on the dual responsibility of providing funds and resources. As a result, the number of overseas Chinese returning to China has gradually decreased, but the supply of skilled personnel continues uninterrupted. For example, Chinese in Vietnam and the Americas have supported aviation development. In addition to sending trained personnel back to China, they are also sponsoring local aviation training at public expense. Recently, Chinese in the United States established the "Overseas Chinese Aviation School" to train aviation personnel. Other regions are providing a steady stream of specialists in aviation, machinery, air defense, chemical defense, communications, engineering, medicine, and rescue. (Remainder omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Residents' Association to be Established Within the Month: Actively Safeguarding Residents' Interests <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, Hong Kong's population has surged, leading to a housing shortage. In this extraordinary situation, residents' interests are often affected. Those concerned about social welfare have formed the "Hong Kong Li Long Residents' Association" to safeguard residents' interests.</p>
<p>Fundraising Concludes</p>
<p>As a result, it has gained sympathy from all walks of life, with many joining. According to a statement by an executive of the association, fundraising concluded last night. Mr. Liao Jiongquan won the overall silver award and the highest number of people, raising a total of 4,359.4 yuan. Other teams also achieved good results. The association has scheduled the inauguration ceremony within this month, inviting prominent figures from all walks of life to participate. (The association's address is 26 Des Voeux Road Central, telephone 32993).</p>
<p>Appointed Legal Counsel</p>
<p>According to the association's constitution, its top priority is to protect the interests of residents. Therefore, it has appointed permanent legal counsel. Members facing unreasonable pressure from landlords, such as rent increases or forced evictions, can request assistance. After review, if the request is reasonable, the association will provide support. In addition, it will make suggestions to the government regarding future events related to the interests of residents.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Conflict over Old Debt Leads to Shooting in Lok Ma Chau Late at Night: Refugee Father and Son Wounded, Wife Killed; Two Assailants at Large, Police Issue Arrest Warrant <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Around 11 PM the night before last, a shooting occurred in the Chiau Mei area of Lok Ma Chau in the New Territories, resulting in the death of one woman and injuries to a man and a child. The victims were refugees from Bao'an who had fled to Hong Kong. Unable to escape the ravages of war, they fell victim to criminals. This is a tragedy within a tragedy. The following is a detailed account: (Originally refugees from Bao'an who fled to Hong Kong)</p>
<p>The victim in this case was Huang Zhong, a female refugee from Bao'an, 41 years old. Her husband was Wang, and they had three children: a 17-year-old eldest daughter, an 11-year-old second son, and an 8-year-old youngest son. They originally lived in Jiada Village, Bao'an. A month ago, × × invaded Bao'an, causing devastation. Huang and her family fled to Hong Kong, crossing the border at Lok Ma Chau, built a thatched hut in Chiau Mei, and temporarily eked out a living. Recently, Bao'an has been recovered by our army, but Huang and her family remained in the New Territories due to the large number of children and the difficulty of moving. They intended to return home after the situation stabilized.</p>
<p>(Conflict Leads to Gun Violence)</p>
<p>Suddenly, Huang's brothers, Huang Jinwen and Huang Hai, came to visit. That afternoon, Huang Zhong kept the two at the hut for dinner, and they were very happy and sociable. One of them even told Huang that they recently acquired two handguns. Huang Zhong then brought up the issue of repaying an old debt. He explained that the two owed him money back home, and since they now had money to buy guns, they should repay the debt. They refused, leading to a dispute. After they left, they returned around midnight and called Huang Zhong and his wife out of the hut. It is unknown what happened, but they began arguing again. Huang Zhong's wife also came out of the hut, and the two assailants opened fire, killing the wife and wounding Huang Zhong and his 11-year-old son, Huang Ri. They then fled. It was late at night, and there was no way to call for help. Only at dawn did someone nearby help them inform the police, who sent the two injured to the hospital for treatment and the deceased to the mortuary. The police are now searching for the assailants to bring them to justice.</p>

The president of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, has decided to accept the post of vice president of the Kuomintang. Chen Youren, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, who has been in Hong Kong for a long time and has not been involved in politics, is also rumored to be resuming his post.

<p>Ms. Kuang Guangyin, an overseas Chinese from the United States, came to Hong Kong via the Pan American Clipper to seek a standard beauty as Miss China to attend the Golden Gate International Exposition. Now, Ms. Kuang has found her goal difficult to achieve and has abandoned the plan. According to Ms. Kuang, Hong Kong women can hardly represent all Chinese women. Ms. Li has scheduled to return to the United States on the Philippine Clipper today.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Big View Film Company Gambling Case: Police Strongly Testify; Gamblers Gathering to Gamble on Pai Gow and Poker; Deputy Attorney General Wei Yi Personally Prosecutes; Defendant Pleads Not Guilty, Hearing Adjourned <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Chao Shurong, director and manager of the Big View Film Company, and Chen Chengjia were charged with running a gambling den. Huang Chong, Zhao Gang, Shang Fei, Li Liang, Chen Ruiquan, Li Hua, Li Tai, and Kuang Fu were charged with gambling. The case was formally brought before the Kowloon Magistracy for trial yesterday morning at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Qian Si Presides</p>
<p>The case was prosecuted by Government Deputy Attorney General Xiong Yi. The defendants hired Barrister Mike Carin to defend them. After the court opened, the barrister representing the defendants pleaded not guilty. Officer He Sheng, Badge Number 112, took the stand to testify. He stated that on the morning of the 24th of last month, he received information and reported it to Officer Yi Hua. At 12:20 AM, Yi Hua led him, Detective Hu Jin, and several other police officers to the address. As he approached the intersection of Ma Tau Wai Road and Pak Tai Street, he left the group and proceeded to the Big View Film Company at 83 Pak Tai Street. Although there was someone guarding the door, he did not stop him from entering. He pushed open the door and entered the main hall, which was the film studio. As he went to the left, he saw 30 people surrounding a large table. As he approached, he saw a gambler in front of him</p>
<p>With four pai gow tiles in front of him and two pink chips. The gambler then opened the tiles, the first pair being 'one seven one earth' and the second pair being 'one day one person'. At this time, he saw the second defendant, Chen Chengjia, saying to the gambler, 'The two pink chips are worth a yuan. Now that you have won, you have to pay a five-cent rake-off.' The gambler listened and gave three silver coins and two white chips, which he handed to the second defendant, who put them into a white iron box. About a foot away from the pai gow table, there was also a poker game. He only saw two people gambling. At this time, Officer Yi rushed in, and he told everyone not to move, but the gamblers still ran around, trying to escape. Later, they</p>
<p>Arrested them. Yi Hua, an intelligence officer from the Hung Hom Police Station, then took the stand to testify. He said that after he and others arrested the defendants that night, he asked who was in charge. About three feet away from the gambling table, there was a bar. The first defendant, Zhao Gang, was standing beside the bar, in a place where his eyes could reach the gamblers. He asked who the manager was, and someone pointed out that Zhao was the manager there, and Zhao also</p>
<p>Admitted to it. He arrested him and returned to the station to file charges. This concludes the prosecution's testimony. The first defendant, Zhao Shurong, then took the stand to present counter-evidence. He claimed that that night, the company's affiliated sports association held a party. The proceeds were all used for refugee relief. Tourists who entered that night were given red, green, and white chips in exchange for cash, so they could spend them at various events, using the chips instead of cash. He did not stop them from gambling on pai gow because they were all doing it for fun, without real money. The hearing continued until around 1:00 PM, and the magistrate then ordered the case to be adjourned to 11:30 AM on the 9th of this month.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong military authorities are actively strengthening their defense forces to cope with the current environment. All military exercises are being conducted continuously. It has been learned that the Hong Kong Air Command has scheduled bomb-dropping exercises to test the strength of the bombs. A notice has been issued asking the Air Force to conduct exercises on the 9th and 10th of this month (Monday and Tuesday), morning and afternoon, in the waters of Ma Wan and Shek O, dropping 500-pound and 200-pound live bombs. The danger zone is located within 2,500 yards of the Ngau Tau Chau promontory. The Army Headquarters has also scheduled live-fire exercises for the 20th and 21st of this month, with the designated location near Half Moon Bay. The danger zone is from the south of Chau Kung Island to Po Toi O, Colinson Hill, Basalt Island, Tathong Channel to Lung Kwu Tan, south of Fat Tong Chau, and south of Chau Kung Island. Those passing through the above locations at that time must be careful to avoid them.</p>

<p>— Zhang Min</p>
<p>The Hong Kong night, truly a beautiful Hong Kong—if you arrive in Hong Kong from the interior of China or Europe and America by night ship: if you arrive in Hong Kong from Kowloon by night ship, following the ship's progress, a night city like a flower lantern gradually pushes itself before you. The three-colored neon lights are the adornments of this fiery crown; the lights on the mountains resemble a string of horizontal pearls. Imagine yourself on a Star Ferry crossing the sea, following the ship's advance, a wonderland gradually unfolds before your eyes.</p>
<p>As the ship approaches the land, the neat asphalt roads clearly line up before you. Once the ship docks, the dazzling advertisements provide clear proof of this "commercial center of the Far East." On the street—are you following my description?—layers of skyscrapers line up before you, both sides filled with private and commercial cars. The traffic police maintaining order turn on the red light, and all car horns cease, allowing you to hurry across.</p>
<p>Please continue to follow me, and immediately you will find yourself on Pedder Street. In front of the Swire House Hotel, turn right along the densely parked cars. You may wonder if every resident of Hong Kong owns a car. Before your doubts are resolved, you will immediately arrive at the foot of one of Hong Kong's most magnificent buildings—Gloucester Tower. A large, luminous clock on the top of the building indicates that it is 10 p.m., the golden hour when the night is just beginning to unfold.</p>
<p>However, you have only seen a part of the orderly and clean facade of the entire Victoria City. I advise you to stop. But if you insist on continuing this comically short journey, then please continue west—are you following me?—After passing the post office, we will be on the tram tracks, right in the heart of the commercial district.</p>
<p>Be careful of the cars and stay safe. Please walk on the sidewalk under the arcades. Just as you are cautiously enjoying the scenery, your foot unexpectedly stumbles over some obstacles. Be careful, you are stepping on someone and almost fell.</p>
<p>Oh my god! In the cold early winter, shivering in torn cotton and worn-out rags, are these piles arranged on the sidewalk people? Yes, they are. They are people sleeping in the open, just like you and me. Isn't this the most amazing of all miracles? Ten feet away, countless cars flow by, carrying countless gentlemen and ladies returning from banquets. Within one foot, the street is full of homeless people sleeping in the open. On one hand, there are warm coats and light furs, and drunkenness and satiety. On the other hand, there are hunger, cold, and pain.</p>
<p>Sleeping in the open! It is a serious problem every winter in Hong Kong. There are people sleeping in the open on the side streets, and the main streets are also full of them. In the past, you could only see single men, but now entire families, old and young, men and women, are present. Especially after the [omitted due to sensitivity] invasion of the south, residents of Guangzhou and surrounding villages have come to Hong Kong one after another. With the demand for housing in Hong Kong far exceeding the supply, landlords who only care about profit evict existing tenants and rent to wealthy tenants from elsewhere. As a result, these homeless refugees and those evicted by landlords have all come to the streets! A torn mat, a tattered blanket, and a close look at the painful heads resting on mud bricks. An entire family, men, women, old and young, take this as their home, huddling together to keep warm with body heat. Each of these people has a tragic story behind them, especially these families who have fled to a foreign land. In the past, each of them had a happy family, but everything was plundered by [omitted due to sensitivity]. Most of the homeless are unemployed, and they mostly live by begging. Occasionally, they work as coolies, but the meager sum of one or two dimes earned each day is simply not enough to feed several mouths. During the day, they roll up their bedding, which they depend on for survival, carry it on their backs, and hide in the shadows of other people's eaves, like a [unclear], going everywhere to try their luck, begging for scraps of cold rice and leftover soup. Night falls. After 11 p.m. or later, the stores close, and everyone competes for a place where they are less likely to be disturbed by store owners. They then lie down to sleep, praying every night for mild weather, having to rely on luck even when they sleep. Injuries are commonplace. They only hope not to get seriously ill, and even more so not to catch a cold. If that happens, it's really bad luck!</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, it was reported that three people had frozen to death. However, this is just the beginning. The cold weather will continue for three more months. There will be more frozen corpses on the road in the future. Although there is a homeless relief society, the number of homeless people is truly too many, and the relief society is truly too small, just like the refugee camps in the New Territories a few days ago, which could not accommodate many refugees despite having facilities. This is truly a blemish.</p>
<p>The poor people sleeping in the open in Hong Kong and Kowloon range from eighty-year-old men to eight-day-old babies. Except for the mountain areas and foreign residential areas, there is no place without them. Wait until midnight to hear the sobs of these hungry and cold people, and you will experience the bitter tune of this unseen world. There is no more ironic contrast than this: on Tan Kung Road in Kowloon, there are doghouses as beautiful as villas, while on Tan Kung Road [unclear] there are groups of people sleeping in the open. Their good dreams are often awakened by the barking of dogs [omitted due to sensitivity]!</p>
<h3 id="e18">Travels in Macau <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>Due to the war of resistance, many merchants and people in Hong Kong and China have suffered greatly. At the same time, precisely because of the war of resistance, the businesses that cater to pleasure consumption have flourished. This is naturally an irregular and abnormal development. Macau has also developed in this state. Taking advantage of the annual leave, the reporter ran to Macau, this Oriental Monte Carlo, to observe the lively situation there. Having only made a brief tour, I will roughly describe what I saw and heard.</p>
<p>Macau's Impression</p>
<p>Taking the steamer to Macau, in less than three hours, Macau's [unclear] silhouette appears before my eyes. The rushing water flows continuously. Small boats shuttle back and forth, calling for passengers and selling goods. The embankment stretches long, and people walk like [unclear]. At first glance, all the [unclear] figures vaguely resemble the Bund in Guangzhou in the past. But now, the cultural relics of Guangzhou are suffering shame, and the prosperous Bund has been reduced to ashes. Thinking about the past and the present, it arouses the indignation of tourists! Before long, the ship docks, the [unclear] vigorously stir, overturning rivers and seas, the mud from the seabed floats to the surface, and there are many garbage and filth [unclear] drifting with the waves, all of which seems to be [unclear] Macau!</p>
<p>Macau's Progress</p>
<p>After the ship docks, the Portuguese [unclear] stand on the pier, standing tall against the wind. Their clothes, hats, and shoes are quite pleasing to the eye. Some passengers in the main cabin, eager to return home, want to disembark as soon as they see the gangway lowered, but are pushed back by the police. It turns out that the method of disembarking passengers here is the same as in Hong Kong. Passengers in the Western-style rooms and Chinese restaurants have priority, followed by passengers in the rear cabin, and finally passengers in the [unclear] cabin. However, the 20-dollar guarantee rule has not yet been implemented at the gate!</p>
<p>In busy traffic areas, Macau, like other places, still has traffic posts and police on duty. The difference is that the police uniforms here are more aesthetically pleasing. On the road, the reporter saw a group of compatriots crossing the road. In order to avoid the military, they stood on the [unclear]. The traffic police officer, looking very [unclear], used a [unclear] Cantonese accent, gesticulating and shouting. This is a very vivid picture. Five years ago, the reporter traveled here and had not seen them working so conscientiously. But five years have passed, and there should be some progress!</p>
<p>Gamblers' Bravery</p>
<p>Macau during the day is still quiet. Two-wheeled trucks roll by, and some lively female students ride their bicycles, leisurely riding on the road. But as dusk fades and the electric lights begin to [unclear] sparks, the entire Macau boils. In the area around Fuk Long Street, prostitutes dress up and swagger about, or play the qin in brothels, lightly singing songs. Lights and music fill the streets, and customers walk back and forth. The mixed sounds of people, the shouting in gambling houses, and the [unclear] in hotels all mix together, creating a chaotic scene that doesn't stop until dawn. The enthusiasm [unclear] is extreme. The bravery of those gamblers placing bets and the recklessness of the patrons are somewhat similar to the situation when loyal men and generals on the front lines charge into battle, fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy [omitted due to sensitivity]. The difference is that the patrons are sacrificing themselves in the pursuit of wild pleasure, while the soldiers are fighting for the survival of the nation. The former is [unclear], is [unclear], while the latter is glorious, is great. This is where the excitement is the same but the essence is different.</p>
<p>Placing Bets and Buying Public Bonds</p>
<p>Macau is smaller than Hong Kong, and Macau does not have as many wealthy merchants as Hong Kong, but the amount of money spent there every day is not small. Although there are no accurate statistics on the spending on prostitution, gambling, and drinking, the gambling hall of a certain large restaurant earned over 200,000 [unclear] on its best days. The rest of the spending can also be imagined. These huge gifts that roll into the pockets of gambling merchants are naturally sent batch by batch from the hands of wealthy merchants and retired bureaucrats. If they could take the spirit and courage of placing bets and going to prostitutes and gamble to buy national salvation bonds, the bond sales in Hong Kong and Macau [unclear] would have been fully subscribed long ago, even exceeding the results of any other place. Why not do this? Is it because they lack a sense of nation and country, or is it in response to the old saying "goods gained dishonestly are also lost dishonestly"!</p>
<p>Work of National Salvation</p>
<p>How is the work of national salvation developing in Macau? This is something that we can all imagine. Moreover, because the Portuguese authorities pay close attention to the progress of this work, sometimes some work cannot be done. The reporter [unclear] searched for the only national salvation organization in Macau, the Women's慰勞分 [unclear], to inquire about their work, but after running around for half a day and asking many people, [unclear] found it. You know where this [unclear] is located? Originally [unclear] in an old [unclear] mansion, with a small sign hanging on the corner of the house, reading Macau Women's慰勞分会 [unclear]. If you don't have [unclear] a certain amount of effort, you will definitely not see it. Others are of course even harder to find. Talking about contact is even more obstructive, so all the work is far worse than in Hong Kong!</p>
<p>Strange Slogans</p>
<p>Along with the lack of much development in the work of national salvation, there are many strange situations there. Walking on the street, I often [unclear] certain nationals walking proudly with their heads held high, their clothes and faces [unclear] similar to our compatriots. It's just that their language and actions are a little different. The rest of the time [unclear], most of the [unclear] are passing by the so-called "楼船 of ×××."</p>
<p>Just as Wang Jingwei published [unclear], many slogans of "×× friendship" and "×× cooperation" were posted in the streets and alleys. Passersby all stopped to watch. Later, a zealous person tore them down, and this [unclear] event [unclear] ended. In addition, there are many, many strange people and strange things that I want to tell my friends but cannot tell, which is of course a regrettable thing!</p>
<p>Finally, although the reporter [unclear] only stayed in Macau for a short time, I have completely witnessed and heard about everything. This is naturally infinitely happy, and at the same time I feel [unclear] limited sadness!</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Japanese "Literary Scene" in 1938 <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Huai</p>
<p>It is really unworthy to use the word "Literary Scene" to describe the dynamics of the Japanese literary world in 1938. Today's Japan only has the "arena" of fascist soldiers. Japanese writers, who have lost their free will, the so-called "literary scene," is at best just a scene played out in the "arena." Japanese critics have already admitted that they have been defeated in literature. But in terms of literary form, the continued production of literary form works is still a fact, such as Hino Ashihei's "Wheat and Soldiers," which is recognized as this year's greatest harvest in Japan. Moreover, they are still boasting that China's literature of resistance has not achieved such "great" results. But the author of "Wheat and Soldiers" is an ordinary soldier. If something made of Chinese blood and flesh is enough to be called "great," then all fascist celebratory literature can be regarded as "great" works. From the perspective of us Chinese, what value can we see in the book "Wheat and Soldiers"? It is that in its bones, it still exposes the [unclear] of the Japanese army to some extent, while reflecting the great spirit shown by the Chinese army and people in the War of Resistance. However, the author's motive is definitely not like this, it's just that his pen is not strong enough to completely cover up all the reality.</p>
<p>But in terms of the merits of the general established Japanese writers, their poverty is a particularly dark period in the history of the Japanese literary scene. First, in terms of the amount published in the seven major magazines, the writer who published the most works was Wada Den (seven articles), followed by Abe Tomoji and Tokunaga Sunao (six articles each), and then Takami Jun and Mamiya Shigeho (five articles each). The above people are the writers who published the most works on this year's Japanese "literary scene."</p>
<p>Among these writers, Tokunaga Sunao's name is quite familiar in China. He "turned" early on, or in other words, he fell early on. So, although he wrote six articles, two of them were about his own memories, such as "Technician Abe Chusuke" and "The First Memory." When a writer begins to write about his own memories, and the purpose is not to suggest the significance of the shift of the times, it means that the writer's literary talent has receded. Memory is his last shadow, and soon even this shadow will disappear. It is said that Tokunaga Sunao has "voluntarily" discontinued several of his past works due to the current situation.</p>
<p>Next is Abe Tomoji. I am afraid that he is not as famous as Tokunaga Sunao among the Chinese. He also published six works this year. According to Kubokawa Tsurujiro's comments, he is not as good as Tokunaga Sunao. Most of them are popular literary works, such as the best-selling book "Beijing," which is an example of [unclear] literature.</p>
<p>Takami Jun's works have probably not been introduced in China. He is a popular writer who emerged one or two years ago, but this year his works have been severely attacked. For example, "The Stage" published in the July issue of "Japan Review" was unexpectedly criticized by Kawabata Yasunari as a bad work. According to Kubokawa Tsurujiro's comments, he also believes that the works he wrote this year are really not worth looking at.</p>
<p>Next, Niwa Fumio and Takeda Rintaro both published only three articles. Niwa's three articles are "The Beaten Lover" (January issue of "Japan Review"), which is about protecting [unclear]. The next is "Wife's Work" (March issue of "Remodeling") and "My Own Affair" (June issue of "Japan Review"). The latter two are said to have new styles. Takeda's three articles are "Ihara Saikaku" (July issue of "Literature"), "Glasses" (January issue of "Literary World"), "Morning Grass" (June issue of "Central Review"). We don't need to examine the content of these works carefully. Just by looking at the titles of these works, we can infer a general situation. In fact, the titles of each article are nothing more than the expression of personal emotions (within the allowed range). None of them reflect the reality of Japanese life. But the whole phenomenon of this literary movement most clearly reflects the actual situation of the literary scene in Japan today—poverty, emptiness, depravity, and darkness.</p>
<p>The above description, although it cannot cover the entire Japanese "literary scene," since some of the more well-known writers are like this, we can get a glimpse of the whole situation. The so-called "undercurrent of the literary scene" is actually just a sewer gasping for breath under the heavy pressure of military fascism.</p>

<p>— Du Ai</p>
<p>When we heard the news of your death, our friends stared blankly in shock. Irresistible sadness overwhelmed your living friends.</p>
<p>In silent mourning, I thought of everything you did in Hong Kong. I will never forget your small body, your reticent and calm face. You seemed to be a simple and silent person, lacking enthusiasm on the surface. However, what was hidden in your heart, in every cell, was sincere friendship and a high degree of work ethic. As long as you thought it should be done, you would do it thoroughly. Your responsibility for "work" is worthy of young people to learn. But your greatest advantage is the initiative and awareness shown in your work. Looking at your private life, it is also a model for young people: simple, unpretentious, without any bad habits. You were living, like countless young people, the most simple and energetic life of a Chinese person in the 1940s. Nothing could contaminate you, nothing could hinder you. You were constantly using calm steps to eliminate all inherited concepts and corrupt temptations, and gradually overcome them. You were never impatient in any situation, even when encountering a very troublesome matter. But you were brave to take responsibility. You were not as rash and arrogant as some people, nor were you like some people who only talk and do nothing. But you also had shortcomings, that is, when you had to speak, you said so little. Some people might see your reticent temper as arrogance. In fact, you were not at all. You had a strong sense of justice. You did not tolerate all corruption and ugliness, but you forgave the ignorant and unfortunate people, giving them deep compassion and ardent love.</p>
<p>On the day you set off for the West River with the service corps, we immediately felt as if something was missing. However, your departure was not for anything else, but for the liberation of the motherland. This made us not feel regretful. In early last month, we learned from your letters that your work had made great progress. You were responsible for the education of several thousand members of the self-defense corps [unclear] repeatedly wrote letters asking the Art Association to mobilize members to go back to assist in the work. However, our mobilization plan had not yet been realized, and the news of your death came. Alas! You died in an enemy air raid.</p>
<p>Although you died like this, you died with glory. Now you are resting in peace, but the dead are also stepping more vigorously on your unfinished road. The motherland is today making unprecedented progress, adhering to the War of Resistance, and our cause of liberation is entering a new stage. Although Wang Jingwei [unclear] changed at this time, the anti-Japanese front has become stronger. Rest in peace! Your glory is as eternal as the glory of the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Death of Zhang Shu <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Shulun</p>
<p>When Nie Er died, Tao Xingzhi mourned in an article:</p>
<p>"Mr. Nie Er's death is the greatest loss to Chinese popular music, almost equivalent to the loss of the Northeast in the country of music. The Northeast can be recovered, but Nie Er cannot be resurrected!"</p>
<p>We will always remember the death of Mr. Nie Er.</p>
<p>Three years later, Zhang Shu, one of the popular song writers who inherited Nie Er's legacy, also died under the [omitted due to sensitivity] bomb. What we feel is a great loss, and a deep hatred for the [omitted due to sensitivity] destruction of culture is deepened in our hearts.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that Nie Er was the most powerful motivator and founder of Chinese new music. After Nie Er's death, a large group of new music workers supported his legacy. Among them—Xinghai, Lü Ji, Sun Shen, He Luting, Saike, Mai Xin, Sha Mei, Xue Chang, and Zhang Shu were constantly creating, producing, and honing their weapons of struggle, proclaiming, calling, educating, and arming the masses from all walks of life in China. They gave the people of China a common, living call!</p>
<p>In the process of developing the new music movement, everyone has a common feeling, that is, the songs created for the working masses are very poor in both quality and quantity, not strong enough, not useful enough, not popular enough, and unable to achieve colloquialization. Unable to convey the life and feelings of the working masses, this makes the new music movement permanently stay at one level, and has not yet reached widespread popularization.</p>
<p>The reason for this is partly because popular songs are not easy to produce, as Mr. Tao Xingzhi pointed out: "A genius who is divorced from the life of the masses will never be able to write popular songs." From this, we can see that popular songs are filtered and permeated from the life of the masses. Based on this, to produce truly popular music, there must first be countless composers who participate in and thoroughly understand the lives of the working masses.</p>
<p>Secondly, although the Chinese new music movement has progressed with the progress of the War of Resistance, its development is still far from mature. This is the phenomenon of overall progress, but also the fact that the composers as a whole will succeed in the fire and blood of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>However, I feel great sorrow and sympathy for the death of Mr. Zhang Shu, this diligent researcher of vocal music and progressive composer. Over the years, Mr. Zhang Shu has been engaged in unremitting labor for popular songs, producing songs such as Vehicle Song, Dike Building Song, Disaster Relief Song, Life Education Song, Protect North China, and Under the Green Star Flag.</p>
<p>These songs are a force of torrent, a living cry, and a common resonance in the hearts of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>However, Zhang [unclear] died. He did not die on the front line, but died under the [omitted due to sensitivity] bombs, because half of the Chinese people are the target of the [omitted due to sensitivity] murder.</p>
<p>Zhang Shu died, but he did not die with any regrets. He used the music he created to attack the enemy, the [unclear] henchmen of fascism.</p>
<p>Countless [unclear] young musicians from the next generation will rise up.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Literary Criticism in 1938 <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Regarding fundamental issues of literary theory, aside from single publications, Mr. Li Nan-zhuo expressed the most opinions this year. He successively published papers such as "On the Popularization of Literature and Art," "Broad Realism," "Further Broad Realism," "On 'Almost' and 'Far From'," and "On the Typical" in "Literary Front." Except for the first article, which is related to the issue of utilizing old forms, the rest are basic issues in literary theory.</p>
<p>As we have briefly analyzed above, the main reason why the creations of writers have not been very satisfactory this year is that writers do not have a deep grasp of the creative methods of realism. Therefore, their grasp of the essence of reality, the subjective ability and personality of the writers, and the characters' personalities are all very superficial. The inevitable result of this is just as Mr. Mao Dun pointed out above. Although Mr. Li's several papers still have a bit of "scholarly air," and besides criticizing Mr. Cao Yu's "Wilderness," they only expound on these basic issues of literary theory in a "purely theoretical" way, Mr. Li's statements are also aimed at current malpractices. Therefore, we believe that his contribution is very significant.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's "Broad Realism" is aimed at narrow realism; "On 'Almost' and 'Far From'" discusses the objective reality and subjective ability. In recent years, the literary world has been filled with debates about "Almost-ism" and "Uniformity-ism." Some people with ulterior motives even use 'almost' and uniformity to attack new literature, and some are even more ridiculous, believing that science has developed to such a high stage that it has made people's methods of understanding tend to be unified, so everyone recognizes the same objective things. Therefore, works cannot help but be "almost" the same. But we do not think so. We agree with the scientification of cognitive methods, and thus the unification of the understanding of objective phenomena. However, "people are different as their faces," and works are different as the faces of their writers. This is not a joke, this is exactly what those ridiculous superficial "theorists" have overlooked or do not understand. May I ask, has there ever been a reader who felt that the works of Mr. Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, and Mao Dun are almost the same? Whether in terms of content or method. Also, no matter how writers learn from Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Balzac, Dickens, or Gorky, Sholokhov, and are influenced by them, no writer learns them perfectly. This is not only a matter of the writer's learning ability, but also a matter of the writer's personality. Tolstoy once said in his unpublished pre-death diary that the most boring thing is to read works that are not infused with the writer's own thoughts and personality. This precisely reveals this problem. Let us ask again: why are the many works with the same theme of the Eight Hundred Warriors or the Great Victory of Taierzhuang not all the same? Why are Ba Jin's works full of enthusiasm, and Mr. Lao She's works full of humor? This is because the content of a work, although in the writer's understanding, may be the "almost" objective reality, but this recognition is not directly copied like a photograph. It is through the process of the writer's artistic generalization, infiltrating the writer's own thoughts, psychology, emotions, and personality components, which becomes the fact that each writer's works has its own characteristics. Therefore, Mr. Li concluded in his article "On 'Almost' and 'Far From'":</p>
<p>"In literary and artistic works, there are some places that should be 'almost', that is where the truth lies, those places should be 'people have the same heart, and hearts have the same reason'."</p>
<p>"But the performance of the writer's personality in the work, which is opposite to this aspect, should not be 'almost', but should be 'far from'. The 'difference' is as 'much' as the difference between the writer's personalities - (see 'Wen Zhen' Volume 1, Issue 6)"</p>
<p>In the article "On the Typical," the author believes that the sum of the three elements of "human nature," "typicality," and "individuality," plus the element of time and the dynamic characters, deserves to be called "typical." In this article, the author quoted many of Gorky's words on typical creation. These have been translated by many people in China, so I will not discuss them here.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to express our condolences to Mr. Li with 120,000 points of enthusiasm, because he passed away on October 14th (?) of this year.</p>
<p>There were also great gains in Lu Xun studies this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun was the creator of China's new female studies and the mentor of China's revolutionary literary movement. His entire legacy shines brightly, indicating the future development of China's new literature. Carrying forward his legacy and his great spirit of research is precisely giving our anti-Japanese war literature fresh nourishment.</p>
<p>In the second anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, in addition to the unprecedented grand event in China's publishing industry, the Complete Works of Lu Xun, which was completed with the joint efforts of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Hu Yuzhi, Mao Dun, Ba Jin and others, "Literary Front" Volume 2, Issue 1 also published a "Commemorative Special Issue." In addition, there is a single-volume comprehensive magazine called "Lu Xun the Thinker," the first article of which is "Lu Xun the Thinker," which is tens of thousands of words long and gives a systematic study and correct interpretation of Mr. Lu Xun's thoughts—its growth, development, and maturity. It would be more beneficial to read this article together with Mr. Wang Renshu's "Mr. Lu Xun's View of Art" in the "Special Issue" of "Wen." Especially valuable is the long article "Lu Xun and the Youth" written by Lu Xun's wife, Ms. Xu Guangping, which uses the most faithful brushstrokes to express Mr. Lu Xun's life in his later years, his enthusiastic love and guidance for young people, his fierce hatred and resistance to the filth and evil of society, etc., extremely profoundly. Before a completely satisfactory biography of Lu Xun comes out, this can be regarded as a biography of Lu Xun. In addition, "The Work of Collecting Lost Works of Lu Xun" in the "Special Issue" also illustrates another aspect of Mr. Lu Xun's career and can be used for reference. Other fragmentary articles, or those that I have not seen, are omitted. (The End)</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Li Huitang, the "Oriental Standard Football Man," has been famous in the football world for a long time. Years ago, when he lived in Shanghai, he set an example for the development of football, and Li's contribution was the greatest. Therefore, Li became famous in Guangdong during the past eighteen years, but he actually succeeded in Shanghai. Now, people in Shanghai still remember him.</p>
<p>Shanghai has fallen into an isolated island, and there are many refugees who urgently need relief. Now, the Shanghai National Disaster Relief Association believes that there are still more than tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Shanghai, which requires a lot of expenses. In order to supplement funds, it plans to hold a charity football match. Because Li Huitang is a famous figure in the football world and has great appeal, it specially entrusted Zhou Shouchen to invite Mr. Li to Shanghai to participate in the match to help the good cause. It is reported that Zhou has forwarded this intention to Mr. Li, but whether Li will go to Shanghai or not is still undetermined.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Guangzhou Lingnan (Red and Gray) and Pui Ying (Green and White) volleyball teams came to Hong Kong and held several charity matches, the volleyball movement, which had been silent for a long time here, gradually showed signs of resurgence.</p>
<p>There are many Pui Ching alumni in Hong Kong who are good at this sport, such as Li Lianying and Tan Jingsu, who were famous players in their early years, but they have not played this tune for a long time, and they have become rusty.</p>
<p>Seeing that Red Gray and Green White have been established one after another, they were excited and summoned old comrades from the school who had fled here, intending to organize a (Red and Blue) team.

<p>— Zhengxue Wang</p>
<p>Do not stop breathing during exercise, and also make breathing commensurate with or harmonious with the action. Otherwise, the body will be greatly damaged, especially the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of deep breathing, the most important are the following five points: (1) Breathe through the nose, not through the mouth; (2) expand the abdomen as much as possible when inhaling, and shrink the abdomen as much as possible when exhaling; (3) all muscles of the body must be relaxed when inhaling, do not use force, and the posture should be natural; (4) cross your arms in front of your chest when exhaling, and compress your chest forcefully to completely expel the air in your lungs; (5) do not breathe against the wind; (6) it is best to do deep breathing for five minutes each time.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two kinds of breathing exercises that are particularly beneficial to the respiratory system, which are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Tighten your lips, leaving only a small hole, similar to the mouth position when blowing a flute, but different from blowing. Then blow air in until your lungs are full of air. When inhaling, you do not need to tighten your lips, like ordinary deep breathing, or you can use your nostrils, but you must cover them with your fingers, leaving only a small hole. Pay attention to using force when inhaling, and the breathing must be deep and long.</p>
<p>(2) Contrary to the previous exercise, slowly exhale the air from the nostrils or the small hole left by the lips. When inhaling, it is the same as ordinary deep breathing.</p>
<p>It is best to do these two breathing exercises before or between exercises, and they should be done alternately with ordinary breathing methods. It is better to do this exercise three times first, and then continue to repeat it for about three or four minutes. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The football movement in the Philippines has made great progress in recent years, and it has a tendency to surpass Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I still remember that when the British Lington Teachers came to the East last spring, they won all battles except for the last one against South China in Hong Kong. When they went to the Philippines to compete, they lost once. Therefore, it can be inferred that the technical level of the Philippine football movement has indeed increased compared to four or five years ago.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-City Game will be realized soon. As for the date of the competition, the Management Group Committee of the General Assembly decided to hold it on the 18th of next month (Lunar New Year's Eve) at the meeting the previous evening.</p>
<p>Committee member Huang Jiajun said to me that the date of this game has not yet been determined and may be changed, because people are busy on New Year's Eve and do not watch the game much. It would be best to hold it on the Lunar New Year. We need to wait for the Philippine side to reply and see when the team arrives in Hong Kong, and then hold a meeting to finalize the date of this game.</p>
<p>The competition program has also been drafted. The first game is the Inter-City Game, and the second and third games are the performance matches. The program is as follows: (Dong Lang)</p>

<p>— A Former Football Fan</p>
<p>I recall that when I first returned to Hong Kong from the south, before I had even unpacked, I was immediately inundated with requests concerning sports. Having been away for many years, I had not been involved in football matters for a long time. Many new players were unfamiliar to me, so how could I possibly offer any technical critique? Thus, I did not dare to act rashly. However, every time I perused the sports pages of the newspapers, I learned that the enthusiasm had not diminished from the past. Compared to when I left for the north, it seemed even greater, which made me yearn for it. Therefore, I went to the stadium as an observer. Unexpectedly, what I saw made me feel that the current football players' skills were far inferior to those of the past. At the time, without any official duty to comment on football, I kept my private opinions to myself and did not tell anyone.</p>
<p>On one occasion, while watching a Chinese opera, I happened to sit next to my old friend, Mr. Kwok Yan-bo. (Mr. Kwok assisted the South China Athletic Association, dedicating his efforts to sports to the point of almost bankrupting himself. The flourishing state of Hong Kong Chinese football today is largely due to his tireless efforts. I will write about his contributions in detail later, simply expressing my admiration for now.) Sitting behind us were a famous football figure and a few sports enthusiasts. During a particularly frustrating moment in the match, Mr. Kwok suddenly turned to me and said, "In your opinion, how do our football players' skills today compare to those of the past? Is there a sign of decline?" I gave a knowing smile and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the person behind us heard this and angrily said, "Are you saying our current football players are declining? The facts show that our achievements are far better than in the past! Just look at the speed and sharpness of the players in the 'Junior Shield' matches. Would the predecessors have ever seen that?" He then cited award-winning performances as evidence. (At that time, South China Athletic Association was invincible, and the Chinese team was exceptionally brave.) The people sitting next to him largely agreed with his words. Mr. Kwok and I felt that we were singing a different tune and should not argue, so we simply exchanged knowing, bitter smiles and remained silent.</p>
<p>Since then, South China Athletic Association has enjoyed smooth sailing, winning the league championship. In the Special Silver Shield competition, the South China brothers swept all the teams and won the finals. Not only that, but of the six Hong Kong First Division football championships, the Chinese team won five. They also reached the final of the Lai Wah Cup, but lost due to not fielding their best players, finishing as runners-up. I was misled by the facts and almost thought that my eyesight was failing, leading me to doubt the accuracy of my observations.</p>
<p>Driven by the need to make a living, I reluctantly returned to being a football commentator. I had to observe the football scene more closely. I felt that the Chinese team's ability to win multiple championships was not due to improved skills, but rather the decline in the talent of the Western teams. When I saw the Corinthian and South China Sea football teams competing, both of whom almost swept Hong Kong, I became more certain that my views were correct. However, the people of Hong Kong said that the Corinthian was a strong team from their country and that the South China Sea team had also made significant progress, no longer being the "Amoy of Wu." I had never witnessed the true level of British football skill, and I only knew that the Corinthian was a famous British team by hearsay. I also had not seen the South China Sea team's past achievements. Therefore, I could not provide concrete evidence that Hong Kong's football skills had declined, rather than the visiting teams being particularly strong. As a result, I simply echoed what others said. Indeed, the visiting teams were strong. As a result, even the strongest Chinese team could only manage one win and one draw against the Corinthian, and only one draw and one narrow victory against the South China Sea team.</p>
<p>However, after watching Hong Kong football for a long time, I still felt that it was not as good as when the national team returned from their second tour of Australia. Nor could it match the football skills of the South China team when a part of the players split to form the Chinese Athletic Association. But where was the evidence? Although I wanted to say something to awaken the football players, I still hesitated. I was left with something stuck in my throat, which was very painful. Therefore, I tried hard to find facts to support my argument in order to publish my humble opinion one day.</p>
<p>On the evening of the South China Athletic Association's banquet for the Corinthian team, I was fortunate enough to be at the end of the table and had a chat with a certain naval officer. I asked him what his critique of the Corinthian's skills was. He said that their skills were good, but not up to the level of their country's strength. He added that their country's naval team was often crushed. I felt that his words had some substance because they were both naval teams. Why was the British team so strong? He said that the British army and navy had football competitions every year, so the soldiers who were best at football were kept in the country for service and not easily transferred abroad. That was why they were so strong. The army and navy teams that came to Hong Kong now were not only far weaker than those stationed in Britain, but even weaker than the players from a mere company or battalion in Hong Kong in the past. The army and navy had no motivation to retain football talent in the country. Hearing this, I suddenly understood and became more certain that this was evidence of the declining standard of Hong Kong football. However, this was just hearsay, and it might not be enough to calm the current football players' arrogance. If I could not calm their arrogance and encourage them to improve, then my words would only hurt their feelings and would be of no help. So I remained silent.</p>
<p>Now that Lee Wai-tong, Ko Siu-nu, Beltroa (some translate it as Bi Lu Du based on the English pronunciation, but translating it from Portuguese would be closer to Bias), Remedios (some translate it as Lei Mi Di based on the Shanghai pronunciation; this was a famous halfback in Hong Kong in his prime, who was selected to represent the Interport team. Back then, when he was famous in the Western football teams, I used to translate his name using the Cantonese pronunciation; I wonder if anyone still remembers it.) and others have returned to the field, I believe I have solid evidence of the declining standard of Hong Kong football and should publish my article.</p>
<p>Lee Wai-tong and Ko Siu-nu are indeed considered by us to be the most outstanding football forwards in Hong Kong during a certain period. However, even during their prime, they were not always guaranteed to score in every game. Now, although these two gentlemen cannot be said to be old, they have passed their golden age of football. If you observe their performance now, their running and dribbling are inferior to their prime. Even though they often failed to score in every game in the past, they are now able to seize opportunities and score frequently, often scoring multiple times in a single game. Taking this as an example, isn't it clear that the current defenders are less skilled than their predecessors?</p>
<p>Beltroa (Bi Lu Du) was indeed a famous forward, but he was not as good as Lin Yuk-ying and Liang Yuk-tong of the Chinese team, Huang Mei-shun of the South China team, or Fox and Makgilovi of the Kowloon team. He was not outstanding even in his prime. Now, after retiring for a long time and getting older, he can still surpass his peers as soon as he comes out. How can he be so skilled? Isn't it simply that the current football players are far worse than in the past? Comparing the two makes it seem like an old man who has returned to the field is extraordinary.</p>
<p>As for Remedios (Lei Mi Di), he was just a halfback during his prime. I remember once when the Western Athletic Club was short of players due to injuries, they used him as an inside back and were defeated. At that time, Remedios was not as good as even an average Western Athletic Club inside back when playing as an inside back, let alone compared to Shashi, Chen Wai, Wu Kam-chuen, and Lai Yuk-tat. However, now, at an older age, he is playing as a right inside back and has the potential to be outstanding. How could he have suddenly learned the skills of an inside back? Isn't it simply that there are few good halfbacks now, so he seems exceptional in comparison?</p>

<p>Entertainment... Three Sisters</p>
<p>Sally, Irene And</p>
<p>Mary</p>
<p>This is a musical featuring singers, musicians, old-time stars, and famous screen actors all in one. The story is scattered, but as a musical, it doesn't necessarily need a perfect story. It succeeds as an entertaining "musical film" simply by relying on gorgeous staging and the humorously interspersed songs and dances.</p>
<p>Alice Faye and Tony Martin have excellent singing and acting skills. Jimmy Durante, with his big nose, is as humorous as ever and is also an outstanding character in the film.</p>
<p>Queen... The Rat</p>
<p>The Rat</p>
<p>This film offers a bold and profound depiction of life in the lower echelons of Parisian society, interwoven with a twisted love triangle. A thief nicknamed "The Rat" is naturally charming and carefree, committing countless thefts, and the police are helpless against him. Later, because he loves both his friend's adopted daughter and is infatuated with another wealthy woman, he accidentally commits murder and is brought to court. The story is very convoluted, but the handling is somewhat vague and lacks plausibility. The lead actors, Ivor Novello and Isabel Jeans, also have mediocre acting skills.</p>
<p>Peace... Panhandle</p>
<p>Panhandle</p>
<p>A film depicting the American West. The plot lacks development, and the first half is somewhat obscure. The second half has some thrilling action scenes and feels more lively and tense. The story tells of the development of a tungsten mine, disputes over land rights, the schemes and sabotage of villains, and the mine owner's efforts to struggle and ultimately achieve success.</p>
<p>George O'Brien gives a satisfying performance in this film.</p>
<p>East... Beloved Enemy</p>
<p>Beloved Enemy</p>
<p>A film about the Irish Revolution. Merle Oberon plays the daughter of a British Governor-General in Ireland, who sympathizes with the Irish Revolution and falls in love with their leader (Brian Aherne).</p>
<p>The director handles the film quite successfully. Several scenes of searching for the Party are also very tense and capture the climax of the drama. The male and female leads are well-matched.</p>
<p>Great China... Lancer Spy</p>
<p>Lancer Spy</p>
<p>The story depicts a British officer who, because of his resemblance to a German officer, is used to impersonate him after the German officer is captured by the British. He goes back to spy on the enemy. However, the German officer has a lover who works as a counter-spy for Germany. Unexpectedly, they genuinely fall in love, reveal their true feelings, and let the fake German officer go back.</p>
<p>Similar spy stories have been told many times in the past, so this film is not particularly innovative. The overall handling is very loose, especially the first half, which is dull. The two leads, George Sanders and Dolores del Río, also give unremarkable performances.</p>
<p>Bright Star... Wells Fargo</p>
<p>Central... The Prisoner of Zenda</p>
<p>The Prisoner of Zenda</p>
<p>A story of a hero and a beauty. The male lead, Ronald Colman, plays two roles, delivering a brilliant performance. The female lead, Madeleine Carroll, and supporting actors such as Raymond Massey, all give excellent performances.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt, in his State of the Union address to Congress today, recalled his previous declarations to the Congress regarding the situation of foreign disturbances and the necessity of the United States preparing to deal with the situation. His speech stated: "As this seventy-sixth Congress opens, we must once again issue a warning. The war threat that now hangs over the entire world, though it has been averted, peace is clearly still not guaranteed. Foreign trends have directly threatened three essential institutions of the United States. The first is religion, the second is democracy, and the third is international faith. In terms of modern culture, these three are interrelated. If religious freedom is attacked, then democracy also suffers. If a democratic government is overthrown, then we cannot see the spirit of freedom of belief. If religion and democracy are diminished, then international faith will retreat to allow the brutal ambition and cruel force. If mankind does not pay attention to religious freedom of belief, democracy and international faith, there is no hope of obtaining peace. The United States is determined to adhere to its previous beliefs and defend these three good institutions. Mankind is encountering a period in which it must not only prepare to defend its family, but also to defend the human faith that establishes churches, governments and cultures. Defending religion, democracy, and international faith is the same thing. If we want to save one of these three, we must decide to save the other two as well. We deeply know what the situation will be if force invades our country. We have resolved to protect the democratic governments and peace-loving people of this hemisphere. But this does not mean that the American republics will not cooperate with countries on other continents, nor does it mean that the United States opposes other countries in the world. The United States is willing to see with other countries the elimination of international aggression, the cessation of the arms race, and the restoration of commerce. Countries with democratic governments can never watch their fellow countries with the same government being invaded without resistance. We have learned an ancient lesson that only defense that is always prepared can reduce the threat of foreign force. In a few days, I will submit to Congress the appropriate steps for defense. If a certain type of government can form a united front to attack democratic governments, it will encounter the resistance of united democratic governments. This kind of democratic government can exist in the United States, and the United States must also have this kind of democratic government. The expansion of the scale of military equipment in the United States in the past six years is unprecedented in previous history. But this kind of work does not use the orders of dictatorial power, does not force labor, does not confiscate capital, does not affect freedom of speech and publication, and all natural human rights. We are now actively conducting democratic work, so we must obtain peace and self-defense. We can use labor and funds to compete with dictatorship. If we want to increase production and consumption, the government should not consider reducing investment. The industrial, commercial, and financial circles of the United States require Congress to take all necessary steps to increase the national income to 8 million million yuan per year. Solving this problem also requires maintaining our freedom at the same time." When Roosevelt walked into Congress, the people in the entire venue responded with warm cheers and applause. Especially when the President's speech reached a highlight, it was met with cheers from the audience, especially when he mentioned the method of the United States preparing to resist foreign threats. The German Chargé d'Affaires to the United States, Thomson, listened quietly to the US President's speech in the auditorium. Other audience members included the French Ambassador, the Spanish Ambassador, and the Portuguese Minister. The President's mother and wife were also in the crowded auditorium. [Reuters, Washington, 4th] Senator Pittman criticized Roosevelt's speech, saying that he believed that the government already knew that it was necessary to use moral, commercial, and financial sanctions to deal with those who violated treaties.</p>
<p>British and French Comments</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] US President Roosevelt's expression that the United States is determined to adopt a firm position to resist aggressor countries is attracting considerable attention from the British people, as Britain is also preparing to deal with new crises in 1939. Some people believe that in addition to Roosevelt's warning, other similar warnings have been obtained through diplomatic channels. The result has triggered Britain's efforts to rearm. The summary of the speech has been transmitted to Britain. After several cabinet members and other government officials learned about it, one of them expressed an opinion: If we have experience in publishing, this opinion is exactly what we have also published. British wireless stations are all receiving Roosevelt's broadcast. Roosevelt's voice is extremely loud and clear. Those listening to the radio can even hear the sound of Roosevelt turning the pages of the speech. At the same time, crowds on the streets are rushing to read the speech with eight-character headlines published in the evening newspapers. All parties in the government feel that Roosevelt's three points are noteworthy. These three points may produce concrete results for international politics. First, the Neutrality Act should be revised so that it is no longer beneficial to aggressors. Second, the words stated that democratic countries can obstruct without war. Third, this is a statement that the United States is willing to consult with other countries on sanctions against aggression, resume talks with other countries on limiting armaments, and revitalize commerce.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] French newspapers criticized the speech of US President Roosevelt, believing that the speech will affect Chamberlain's attitude towards Italy. The famous political commentator Madame Tabouis said in the 'Labor Daily,' 'The American President's declaration will definitely have an impact on the policies of dictators.' The 'Rothschild Report' stated that President Roosevelt's speech will have an immediate echo.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] Wall Street unanimously stated that President Roosevelt's speech was moderate in tone regarding the American treasure industry. The main purpose of the speech was to lay the groundwork for a large-scale expansion. In the past, governments often proposed plans in advance for this type of major political power, but this time it was uniquely lacking. Observers speculated that the government's move was to induce critics of the "New Deal" to come forward and each propose their own separate plans. At that time, the government would make the plan public again. Mr. also blamed the unemployment case on the country. He implied to the country that if the country's various expenditures were reduced, causing the people to suffer, then the country would have to be judged by the voters, because the voters still admire the self-governing agenda. Washington officials are all very concerned about this, saying that Mr. Luo's skills are high.</p>

<p>[United News Agency, London, 5th] The News Agency reported that the British Navy's various fleets will add more than 100 new vessels according to this year's plan, including 10,000-ton cruisers, and even larger warships. Those currently under construction must be completed by 1940. In addition to the 35,000-ton warships that have already begun construction, the five aircraft carriers under construction will have two completed this year. Of the 22 cruisers planned, three 10,000-ton vessels will be ready for service this year. Of the 23 destroyers, 20 will be completed. Of the 25 submarines, 13 will be built. This year, there will also be three auxiliary ships, four torpedo boats, three reconnaissance ships, one submarine mother ship, two river gunboats, and 30 light vessels ready. According to the 1939-40 naval shipbuilding schedule, seven new cruisers should be ready for service this year. Of the five 35,000-ton warships currently under construction, two should be completed next year, and the remaining three must be completed in 1941. There are also two large warships whose plans have been reviewed, but construction has not yet begun. It is said that each will reach 40,000 tons. The report also said that, according to current estimates, there are approximately 150 British warships under construction.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Los Angeles, 5th] The US fleet here sailed out yesterday morning in the dim light. There were only a few green lights in the port, sometimes bright and sometimes dim. Everything showed a wartime secret operation. The warships were lined up in front, and aircraft flew in formation overhead. This exercise is scheduled to be held on February 1. The "White Fleet" of attackers is commanded by Carl Vinson, and the "Black Fleet" of defenders is commanded by Andrew. All US warships will participate. This day and night offensive and defensive battle, submarines, and various aircraft will also participate. The soldiers participating in the exercise will reach 50,000, and the officers will reach 3,000. The exercise is expected to be completed in early June.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Roosevelt's Message to Congress: Firmly Requesting Amendment of the Neutrality Act, Aggressive Actions Cannot Be Ignored, Vigorously Criticizing the Dictatorial System <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] The Senate and the House of Representatives held a joint meeting in the House of Representatives this afternoon. President Roosevelt arrived at the venue at 1:00 PM (local time) and immediately personally announced the message, stating that the Neutrality Act, in its current form, is sufficient to facilitate aggressive countries and is not conducive to countries that are being invaded. It must be amended. Aggressive actions, no matter where they occur, should not be ignored by the United States without lodging a protest. At this time, the three things that are indispensable to the American people, namely religious democracy and international sincerity, are being threatened and must be defended. We should also strengthen our military and prevent various aggressions before war breaks out. He then vigorously criticized the dictatorial system. Finally, when talking about domestic affairs, he said that the federal government's expenditure on various projects should continue to be promoted until the total annual income of the country returns to its original amount of 8 million million US dollars.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] When US President Roosevelt read a message to his country's Congress today, advocating for an amendment to the current Neutrality Act, diplomatic and political figures here were deeply impressed. They believed that President Roosevelt's actions were to further guide American public opinion to understand that countries with the same ideals must establish a common defense line. However, it is not yet known whether the Neutrality Act amendment will be proposed immediately. In addition, President Roosevelt also denounced the dictatorial countries in his message, and his wording was almost equal to the speech given by US Secretary of the Interior Ickes on the 18th of last month.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 4th] According to the Soviet official news agency, February 23rd is the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Red Army. All members of the Red Army are scheduled to take an oath on this day. The full text of the oath will be published in various newspapers. In the past, the Soviet Red Army took oaths in a collective manner, making verbal oaths. However, this new oath will be read by every Red Army soldier and signed on the oath. The content of the new oath is roughly as follows: Every Soviet soldier vows to be an honest and law-abiding combatant. The Red Army is willing to abide by the orders of the workers' and peasants' government and defend the motherland. There is a sentence in the oath that says, "I, standing as a combatant of the workers' and peasants' army, vow to use courage, ingenuity, seriousness, and glorious actions, regardless of my own life, to defend the motherland and to complete the victory over our enemies."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 4th] After US President Roosevelt read the message to his country's Congress yesterday, Italian political figures were deeply impressed. They all said that the policies promoted by the United States may become increasingly unfavorable to dictatorial countries in the future, which is a cause for concern. Relations between the United States and Italy were originally not very good, and may become increasingly worse in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e43">England and the United States Urge the Government to Act in Concert, Cabinet Members Discuss Strong Measures to Deal with Japan's Discriminatory Trade <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] 'Financial News' published a lengthy unsigned article today, stating, "The increasingly fascist nature of the Japanese government is by no means a good omen for British trade interests in China." After detailing the significant losses suffered by British trade in China due to the Sino-Japanese war, the article stated, "These reasons and the dissatisfaction of the Japanese military authorities make it clear to us that Japan will not be satisfied unless it completely controls China's trade and resources, eliminates the interests of other countries, and permanently abolishes the 'Open Door' policy. If Japan succeeds, it will establish a powerful government in the style of 'Manchukuo' (the current puppet provisional government in Peiping is powerless because it cannot gain the people's trust). We can resolutely state that British interests will prevent this outcome at any cost. If Britain waits for Japan to achieve its aims, a British-Japanese conflict will be inevitable. Providing economic aid to China through credit loans is very effective, and it costs far less than directly engaging in war with Japanese imperialism." The author also suggested that the government take steps to prevent British automotive products and essential materials from being transported to Japan, and to prohibit Japanese goods from being imported into England.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The Yorkshire Post (known as the mouthpiece of former Foreign Secretary Eden) recently reported that cabinet members will discuss countermeasures against Japan's policies towards China before the resumption of Parliament on January 31st. At that time, a more forceful attitude may be adopted to deal with Japan's discrimination against British trade. All actions taken by England should be consistent with the attitude of the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] Regarding the matter of upholding the Nine-Power Treaty concerning China, the second note presented by the US government to Japan was recently published in an editorial by the Yorkshire Post. The editorial stated that the note presented by the US government to Japan on October 6th of last year firmly refuted Japan's claim that after establishing a so-called new order in the Far East through military action, it could unilaterally revise existing treaties and other conditions. Other governments should regard this as an invitation to the British government to follow the US and demand that Japan accept the US proposal to convene an international conference and the suggestions that will be put forward. The British government has no reason to refuse to publicly declare its willingness to act in concert with the US. Furthermore, the editorial recalled that in January 1932, former US Secretary of State Stimson presented a note to the British government, advocating that the US and the UK adopt a coordinated policy to deal with the September 18th Incident. Because the British government failed to do so, it was criticized by public opinion in both countries and others. Now, how can we not take this as a warning from the past?</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The Chinese Ambassador to England, Quo Tai-chi, stated in a speech this evening that the Chinese people are determined to resist until the end, their strength has greatly increased, and they are sure to persevere until a just and lasting peace is achieved.

<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 5th] Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax were originally scheduled to return to London at the end of this week, but they suddenly returned to the capital yesterday. Although officials and the Prime Minister's spokesmen strenuously denied that their early return was due to a cabinet meeting being held this week, observers believe that the two men's journey must be of great importance. London is paying close attention to the recent fierce offensive by Spanish rebels, so the British government's attitude towards the Spanish and Mediterranean issues has become firmer in recent days, hence Chamberlain and Halifax returned to London early.</p>
<p>[Haihun News Agency, London, 5th] According to the diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Herald", the British Foreign Office is currently undergoing reorganization. The Spanish issue, previously handled by the "Western" division, has now been transferred to the "Southern" division, which handles Italian affairs. The British government, recognizing the close relationship between the Spanish and Italian issues, felt the need to consider reorganizing external affairs. It is also rumored that the British representative in Burgos, Rotton Braid, is currently under surveillance by rebel police, but this has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e46">Formation of the New Japanese Cabinet <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese cabinet was formally formed yesterday (the 5th). Today's questions are: Why did the Konoe Cabinet finally collapse? What is the significance of the formation of this new Hiranuma Cabinet? Where will Japan go from here? What impact will it have on China and the world?</p>
<p>The Konoe Cabinet was originally a cabinet of military cliques and financial groups, whose mission was to launch and support a large-scale invasion of China, laying the foundation for the distant hegemony of fascist aggressors. However, this cabinet met with resistance in the face of China's persistent war of resistance. Its "quick victory" strategy could not be realized, the domestic financial crisis was intensifying, and international isolation was deepening, making it impossible for the Konoe Cabinet to complete its mission. It勉强supported撐 until today because, on the one hand, China became more and more brave in the war and refused to compromise, and the policy of 注精的投降capitulation was completely破breaked; on the other hand, the attitude of the Central America反日Anti-Japanese援華Aid China became more and more active, and Japan felt more and more立isolated in the international形琳situation. In addition, the intensification of Japan's own difficulties, such as the difficulty in passing the Total Mobilization Act and the庞人huge budget案, exposed the inability of the Konoe Cabinet to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p>The emergence of the new Hiranuma Cabinet is an attempt to use a more robust政權regime to alleviate its internal difficulties and to save Japan's fate of falling into末路the end of the road in the international arena with a "new situation"招牌signboard. A perusal of the new Hiranuma cabinet阵容lineup reveals two characteristics that support the above arguments: First, from Prime Minister Hiranuma downwards, all cabinet members are closer to fascist軍military　 or衹為only for軍military　　策figures, which is 使so that軍事military財政finance外交diplomacy更加更團called稱, that is, to使so that這三者these three are更緊密more closely控制controlled in法西斯fascist軍military　　的手中hands of,以便進so that to有邃無前途的war war. Second, the下合union of 内相末次interior minister Sue, the民政党總裁civil administration party president町与田 and the 政友会分子seiyuukai elements前日拉阁, and the　連connection of 外相有田,the　正justification of 藏次石原, fully表露exposes their intention to緩和appease internal不安unrest and國際孤立international isolation.</p>
<p>However, Japan's rulers　“更引”will still be in vain, because the main task of the Hiranuma坐阁cabinet is still to complete the “conquest of China” and “establish the East Asian order”. In order to complete this task, they must continue to strengthen their勾結collusion with Germany and Italy, which will inevitably使使其with Central America衝突conflict will be even more serious. Internally, they cannot　violence through庞a huge,budget案 and實施the implementation of總動員total mobilization法all, so will again加深deepen its財政financial crisis and激化激化 the人民人民anti-war運動movement, let alone China's抵抗resistance力　power is日日development and國勢the country's situation益見對日不利becomes more unfavorable to Japan! However, this renewal by the Japanese rulers is顯為显然a狂妄presumptuous威脅threat to world和平peace and民主democracy. It will使make the Japanese people受undergo更大的更大的 hardships, and it will使make China and all countries of peace and democracy益堅益堅 their反侵略反侵略决心determination.</p>
<h3 id="e47">× Brief Biographies of New Cabinet Members <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The current Japanese cabinet has two major features. First, there are many concurrent appointments, indicating the haste of its formation. Second, many cabinet members are second-rate or lower figures, and it must be called a "weak cabinet." Here are brief biographies of Hiranuma and others:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hiranuma</p>
<p>From Okayama Prefecture, currently 73 years old, a夫. After graduating from the English and French Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University in 1889, he immediately joined the Ministry of Justice. In 1911, he became the Vice Minister of Justice, and subsequently served as Prosecutor General and President of the Supreme Court. In 1923, he served as the Minister of Justice in the second Yumoto Cabinet. In 1924, he became a Privy Councilor. In 1925, he became the Vice Chairman of the Privy Council and concurrently served as a member of the Imperial Family System Review Committee, and was awarded the title of Baron. In 1936, he was promoted to Chairman of the Privy Council until today. Hiranuma was originally the leader of the famous Japanese fascist group Kokuhonsha, as is well known. Kokuhonsha originated from the Tokyo Imperial University anti-foreign group, the Kyokoku Doshikai. This association was established in 1920, and Hiranuma was immediately appointed as an advisor the following year. In 1924, after Hiranuma resigned as Minister of Justice, he organized this so-called "spiritual education group" called Kokuhonsha. Hiranuma once自declared自己 that he did not believe in fascism, but Kokuhonsha was a important fascist group in Japan, which is an iron fact. At that time, those related to Kokuhonsha included important figures from the military, bureaucracy, and financial circles, such as Togo Heihachiro, Saito Makoto, Ugaki Kazushige, Kato Kanju, Osumi Mineo, Araki Sadao, Masaki Jinzaburo, Koiso Kuniaki, Hata Shunroku, Matsui Iwane, Mizuta Tessei, Fujiwara Ginjuro, Tanabe Harumichi, Ikeda Seihin, and Yuki Toyotaro all supported it, so Hiranuma's potential勢力power was 當large, and次there have been calls for cabinet reshuffles, but precisely because the relationships were too complicated, he often offended many parties, so Hiranuma could not take office several times. After the February 26th Incident, when the Japanese political situation changed drastically, Hiranuma, after obtaining the position of member of the Privy Council, immediately resigned from the position of President of Kokuhonsha, and immediately announced the dissolution of Kokuhonsha. Due to his position, Hiranuma's fascist activities have been slightly沉前silenced in recent times.</p>
<p>This time, Hiranuma was able to take the stage amidst the contradictions and oppositions of various factions. It can be said that he enjoys the addiction of being Prime Minister, but the future is difficult to be optimistic, and his life will be short. The old and cunning Hiranuma has connections in all aspects, but all factions do not have—good feelings towards him. Currently, they are using him as a temporary過波transition, because the military fascist considers Hiranuma difficult to be a old-fashioned fascist household, but he is not a pure activist. In recent years, he has been too closely associated with 元老重臣elder statesmen, senior officials, and bureaucrats, and has become deeply infected with bureaucratic tendencies himself, which is not favored by young fascist elements. At the same time, political parties and financial groups consider Hiranuma to be a fascist leader and quite hate him. Let's see how Hiranuma handles such a complicated Japanese political situation.</p>
<p>Iron Minister Maeda</p>
<p>From Wakayama Prefecture, 58 years old. Graduated from Tokyo Law School and worked as a lawyer. In 1931, he served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Inukai Cabinet. In 1936, he served as Minister of Railways in the Hirota Cabinet. In 1937, he served as a cabinet councillor until now. This is the second time he has served as Minister of Railways. Maeda is a heavyweight figure in the Seiyukai and has served as the party's Chief of General Affairs and Secretary-General. He is currently one of the acting members. He has considerable political skills, is not a said party, but is close to the military fascist, and is very active in the new party movement. He advocates abandoning established political parties. In the recent struggle between the Nakajima and Hatoyama factions in the political party, Maeda tends towards Nakajima and is actually a tool of fascism.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Machida</p>
<p>From Akita Prefecture, 77 years old, a veteran politician. In 1915, he served as a Parliamentary Councilor in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. In 1925, in the first Wakatsuki Cabinet, in 1929, in the Hamaguchi Cabinet, and in 1931, in the second Wakatsuki Cabinet, Machida served as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. In 1934, he served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Okada Cabinet. After Takahashi was killed in the February 26th Incident, he temporarily served as Minister of Finance for a few days. In the autumn of 1937, the Cabinet Counselor system was established, and he took office as a Cabinet Councillor until now. This is the fourth time he has served as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. Machida is the leader of the Minseito Party and has served as the party's president for many years. He is still in office. He also has financial skills and was originally a key member of the Yama. financial group.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ishiwatari</p>
<p>From Tokyo, currently 48 years old. Graduated from the English and French Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University. He has served as an investigator in the Bureau of Decorations within the Cabinet, Director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and Vice Minister of Finance. During the tenures of former Finance Minister Kaya and the recently resigned Finance Minister Ikeda, Ishibayashi served as Vice Minister of Finance for both terms. He has special abilities in budget preparation. He participated in the preparation of all budgets. In recent years, he has belonged to all those responsible for compiling the huge military budget and is a financial technician similar to Kaya. He originally did not have any power in the financial and economic circles, but is a pro-military young financial bureaucrat, so he was able to serve as a key position as Finance Minister this time.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e48">Local Officials in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction is inextricably linked to the soundness of local political institutions. It is frequently heard that local governments in various provinces and regions will undergo some changes, and this is likely the reason. Recently, what has been seen as fact one after another: the transformation of the Xikang Special District into a province, with Liu Wenhui as the chairman of the provincial government; Li Hanhun succeeded Wu Tiecheng as the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government; in addition, there are rumors about a certain person in a certain province, which may not be without cause.</p>
<p>In any national institution, the temporary transfer of local officials is a normal administrative process and does not necessarily require special reasons or unexpected changes. However, in China, the general public still pays excessive attention to such matters, probably because the promotion, demotion, advancement and retreat of local officials at all levels have not entered a normal track. Changes in officials have often evolved into subtle waves in the officialdom, and their impact has spread widely. Moreover, when the state of separatism in the early years has not yet been eradicated, governing provinces and regions is like feudalism, and the gains and losses of their power and position are the ebb and flow of power. Even though the unification of national politics has been completed now, there are still people in the folk who are blindly committed to traditional concepts without being aware of it. For this reason, all personnel matters of this kind are the focus of general interest and attention, and people are happy to talk about them: is this not what is meant by being able to stop but not stopping? Although, those who bear the responsibility for one aspect are indeed the pivot between the central and local governments. Whether or not the national laws and policies are carried out smoothly? Whether or not the meritorious orders are effective? Whether or not it is appropriate to govern the province independently and adapt measures to local conditions? As for national politics and provincial politics, there will inevitably be benefits and drawbacks, and gains and losses will be mutually visible. The division of benefits and drawbacks, gains and losses has a direct impact on the people, and the components that turn out to be disasters or blessings are completely different. This is especially tied to whether or not the provincial government obtains the right people? Whether or not the method is appropriate? It is the same in peacetime, and even more so in the extraordinary period of war of resistance and national reconstruction. I have heard that half a year ago, the National Government repeatedly instructed various provinces and regions in various ways, saying that party politics and the military must be one: and that all aspects of wartime must be dominated by military affairs; moreover, it internally determined the principles for the selection of local officials, saying that in the war zones, military personnel must be appointed. Adapting measures to local conditions, this should naturally be the case. Therefore, provinces that did not meet the principles of personnel selection at that time were all rectified, except for Guizhou and Guangdong, which were relatively far from the front lines; now, with the war in Lingnan, Li Hanhun has been given important responsibilities, and Li is indeed a talented and outstanding general.</p>
<p>At this time, when several provincial governments have been reorganized and it is rumored that several provincial governments will also be reorganized, I would like to offer a suggestion to our central government: The war of resistance and national reconstruction are of course led by the central government, which coordinates and plans the overall situation, but morale, popular support, manpower, and material resources must originate from the local level. Therefore, the local level should be regarded as the foundation of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and the achievements of local government should be the main object of reviewing national politics. It is good that national politics and military affairs can only have partial perfection and not overall perfection. There is absolutely no overall perfection and local imperfection. In recent years, China has made extremely many and rapid advances; however, the greatest of these is due to the sincere efforts of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the program of goodness of the whole and the partial cannot make a reasonable balance and progress, not only forming a畸unnatural shape, but also having an倒置inverted view; the Qingmingclear air, the laborious expressions, and the efficiency of work are almost all directly proportional to the distance from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; those who are not like this are only exceptions. Such an unbalanced state, on the one hand, can be celebrated for the Chinese nation's acquisition of a leader who surpasses the crowd, and on the other hand, it must spur each level of politics after the leader, starting from the responsibility of morality and office, to have a keen self-awareness and strive for goodness. The civil servants of the central government, assisting the leader, of course have their solemn responsibilities; but local officials are solely responsible for one aspect, and their responsibilities are even heavier. Therefore, the central government's selection of local officials should not only seek their ability to be loyal and obedient to the central government, but must also seek their ability and talent to achieve practical results to follow the central government. This is how we can cultivate a far-reaching fundamental source for the war of resistance and national reconstruction and determine a deep and solid foundation for the whole. Having obtained the right people, it is especially necessary to thoroughly correct the past failures to divide the power of certain provinces and entrust them separately; and to fundamentally recognize the absolute necessity of the party, politics, and military so that they can be a part of a whole, giving that person full responsibility and full power, so that they can fully exert their ability and talent; if not, the reorganization is useless: it must be so, so that they can be held responsible for completing the entire task.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Overview of the Week's War Situation (From December 26th to January 1st) <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Minister of Political Affairs, Chen Cheng</p>
<p>(Guangdong Area)</p>
<p>Since our fierce counter-offensive in Guangdong, giving a 重重重创heavy blow to the ×army, the ×army谋plans to shorten the defense line,整理reorganize and await援aid. Also, in Zengcheng, Huangpu, Shunde, Jiujiang, Foshan, Sanshui and other areas around Guangzhou, they are actively building工事constructions as a plan for retreating and attacking. Recently, the ×army in Zengcheng and 上下罗冈Shangxia Luogang have been袭击attacked by our certain troops' assault team, causing great恐慌panic, 发炮firing artillery at night, and 消称claiming there are a lot of弹药ammunition. The ×army in Shilong was袭击attacked by our certain assault team on the night of the 28th. They battled each other in the巷巷 streets for a few hours, killing over a hundred people. At the break of dawn, our troops still safely retreated back to the original阵地position. Around one thousand people of a part of the Foshan ×army were调官dispatched, and around one连队regiment was调回transferred back from someplace to 填补fill.　　　　调adjustments, The Sanshui ×army of around one division seems to be actively preparing. Rumor has it that there is still a subsequent troop continuously transporting. They have an active intention toward the West River. The North Sea and Hainan Island Sea×warships have not been seen active.</p>
<p>(Hunan-Jiangxi Area)</p>
<p>On the Yuehan Northern Section and　浔Xun Areas, In the Yuehan Northern Section, the war area has been quite沉寂silent in recent days. Our×army is still対峙confronting on the 新墙河Xinqiang River　岭街Lingjie Line. Our troops夜袭night assaulted the　林Lin of Lingxiang on the night of the first, killing many ×armies. The 残×remnants fled to the north in a panic. On the 南　方面South Side, ×army and our are still対峙confronting on both banks of the 修河Xiu River. Except for a small contact occasionally with ×army by the guerrilla troops, there has been no fierce war yet on the正面front. Our military took advantage of the ×army's lack of防备readiness on the dawn of the first day and violently攻战engaged the ×army at each main point between Yongxiu and Dean, killing many ×armies. The 残×remnants all溃退collapsed and retreated, and we are sending teams to pursue in.</p>
<p>(Hubei-Henan Area)</p>
<p>In the Northern Hubei Area, the ×armies at Yingshan, Taolin River,　河舖He Pu, etc. have all退退 retreated to Zhe River after our掃蕩suppression. The Guan Temple ×army also retreated to Yingshan. The Anlu ×army was袭击attacked by our certain troop, and took Qinglongtan. The ×army retreated to Yandundian. The 皂市Zaoshi ×army of around 2000 is very戒严vigilant, and looks very恐慌panicked. In the Southern Henan Area, there has been no war situation recently, but the ×army has been quite active in the Eastern Henan Area. The ×armies near Shang對对Kaifeng have increased to 5000-6000 people. A part of a few hundreds of people are invading Tuocheng County, and are now in fierce engagement with our守城defending troops. Although Tongxu has been occupied by ×army, it is not　invaded to the west due to the牽制restraint of our guerrilla troops. In the Northern Henan Area, the Newxiang ×army headquarters was袭击attacked by our plainclothes team. The fire burned all day. The Newxiang North, the Luwangfen Station was　attacked, and the ×army did not支support and溃退collapsed and retreated north.</p>
<p>(Shanxi-Suiyuan Area)</p>
<p>The Shanxi ×army is recently planning to aggressively攻打attack our military, to prepare to cross the river and invade westward. Beginning in the late December, they began attacking in路routes. One from Hejin attacking north, after being severely stricken by us near Mount Yumen, has already crawled back to Hejin. One from Linfen attacking westward, with the ×army south from Fenyang,窜crawled to the 大窘 大窘 on the 29th.　使make some parts disturb Jixian and Xiangning. It is now in intense battle with us. One from Fenyang crossing Jiuyu attacking south, met our troop 裁击裁击, and did not succeed. One from Lishi attacking, was 邀击intercepted by us near Liulin, and a part has already crawled back. Other parts are still planning to invade west. Our military is駆逐driving them out in different routes. In summary, between Jixian and Xiangning, is our predetermined戰战, and has been planned with strict. Expect that the ×army on this side will suffer a great blow in days. In the Guyuan area of Suiyuan, ×army continued to add, and looks like西犯　樣 invading west. Because they fear our guerrilla troops襲attack, recently demolished the houses inside Guyuan City and　園園Zhoulili, and the refugees without homes have群起risen to join the guerrilla troops, giving　a serious戚胁threat, At the same time, the偽軍puppet troops of the land are互相互相 内鬨内讧, and the more powerful troop is　酝酿plotting 反正counter-attack.</p>
<p>(Hebei Area)</p>
<p>There are a lot of駐駐 troops stationed in each main point on the North Section of the Pinghan Line. There are over ten thousands of ×armies near Shijiazhuang. Around seven thousands of that part have gradually shifted westward, seemingly to增援aid Shanxi. In summary,</p>
<p>(This Week's War Situation)</p>
<p>There has been no special man war in each side. In the Southern China Area, the Guangdong ×army seems to hold the main point in the vicinity of Guangzhou and the据据base of Humen and Dongguan. With the main force invading Zhao　 from Sanshui,　after our each line simultaneously attacked, giving the ×army no time to consider both ends, and repeatedly受under重创重创, forcing them to retreat back to the original阵地陣地.　Only the little contacts are间间 in华中the middle lines, it seems the ×army concentrates the 武演武演 to 整理整理. We are waiting for the opportunity to 围　围　. In华北Northern China　, the Shanxi 察绥察绥 ×army seems比较active, and曾曾 attacked晋西western Shanxi in different ways. However, after迎头被head on attack , its 损失损失頗頗. It is still in 对对抗 confrontation near 河津河津, 离石离石. Our army are strictly防范vigilant and the forces are雄雄, and it is痴人作梦foolish dreams if the ×army want to break波波 west. At the start of the second明抗战Ming resistance, it is actually good for us for the ×armies to penetrate into mountains. No matter in the 政政 strategic and 战卫战卫 each side, it has shown　心心 tired and daily　. We often utilize the new战战 strategy and tactics and implement a complete打击打击×people to make them tired to run and迫迫 make them lose their position and to make a serious break to collapse. That is the wish that we can预祝anticipate at the start of the the renewing season of the year of 28.</p>
<h3 id="e50">A Foreigner Arrives in Shanghai and Talks About the Current Situation in Japan; Foreign Magazines Become Rare Items; Kobe and Yokohama Have Become <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondent] According to a foreigner who came to Shanghai from Japan, the Japanese people's concern and anxiety about the crisis in relations between Japan and the Soviet Union can be seen everywhere. Japanese people, who are accustomed to talking with foreigners, secretly declare that the situation is tense and the tragic result for Japan can hardly be avoided. The police are extremely active and their surveillance of the Japanese people is even greater than that of foreigners. Therefore, conversations almost prohibit mentioning international events. News is, of course, censored, and exchange restrictions are strictly enforced. Even for foreigners subscribing to foreign newspapers, they must gather many foreigners to pool foreign exchange to pay for the newspapers. Apart from government figures, foreign magazines have become rare luxury items. The traveler used to see Kobe and Yokohama as bustling commercial cities, but now they are like dead cities. Commerce in both places seems to be at a standstill. Docks and transport terminals are guarded by soldiers. The docks in Osaka are occupied by loading and unloading military supplies, and the ships used for transportation are all military vessels, so the ships there are　and cannot engage in freight. A certain ship inspector from the police station talked about this war, which is a rare move by Japanese officials. It is said that Japan was wrong not to engage in a war as large as today's in 1932.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Intense Battle in Jiangbei, The Situation in Haimen Eases <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Starting from the 22nd of this month, the Japanese side has gathered a large force and launched attacks along the river from both land and water, resulting in fierce battles with our forces. Currently, the situation in Haimen has eased somewhat, and the center of the fighting has shifted to Sanhe Port in Qidong. Foreign merchant ships have temporarily suspended operations since December 28th. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Advance</p>
<p>The guerrilla forces in Haimen, Qidong, Tongzhou, and other areas of Jiangsu Province have been reorganized into regular troops by the provincial authorities and are under the command of Li Mingyang. The military strength of each county has been increasing day by day. Most of the soldiers are veterans with sharp weapons, stationed along the river, constantly attacking the Japanese army, which has become a thorn in the side of the Japanese. They have long wanted to launch a large-scale attack to eliminate them. Therefore, on December 22nd, they mobilized more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers, along with puppet Manchukuo troops and local puppet police, totaling about 5,000 to 6,000 people, from Nantong, Haimen, Qinglong Port Dasheng Third Factory, and several gunboats, advancing in five directions, guided by traitors and forcibly recruited civilians.</p>
<p>We Inflict Heavy Damage</p>
<p>The Tongzhou, Haimen, and Qidong forces had long prepared for the Japanese's ambition to attack. This time, under the unified command of Sun Xuechao, the magistrate of Haimen County and commander of the 5th Brigade of the 4th District of the 24th Group Army, and with the cooperation of generals Ding Jutang, Zhang Nengren, Chen Caiyun, Lu Zhoupei, and Sun Xuechao from northern Jiangsu, they launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese army. They had previously moved the riverine troops inland to avoid the danger of attacks from both land and water. The Japanese army launched an all-out offensive, and except for heavier losses by Sun Xuechao's troops, the other units remained intact. However, when the Japanese troops invaded Songjigang and Lao Honggang, they suffered about 100 casualties, and the puppet police also suffered casualties.</p>
<p>Shift to Qidong</p>
<p>According to people from Haimen, the fighting has continued for a week since it began on December 22nd and has not yet stopped. The situation in Haimen has eased, but the center of the fighting has shifted to Sanhe Port and Dongyihao Port in Qidong. This time, the Japanese army harassed various ports in Haimen but suffered heavy losses due to the combined counterattacks of the Chinese army. All the occupied ports were retaken by the Chinese army after the thin Japanese forces were driven back, and defenses were restored. However, dozens of gunboats and speedboats frequently patrolled and harassed the coast. The Chinese army has taken strict precautions, and the Japanese army has not dared to cross the river easily. The Japanese army in Qinglong Port Dasheng Third Factory is also under siege.</p>
<p>All Ships Suspend Service</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war at various ports in Beisha, local residents feared large-scale burning and killing by the Japanese army and fled to seek refuge. All commercial activities have also completely stopped. Although the situation at Haimen, Songjigang, Niuhonggang, Shujigang, Lao Honggang, Xingang, and Lingdiangang has become orderly and stable, commerce has not yet recovered. Therefore, the foreign merchant ships Winton, Changde, Deyi, Fulu, Libei, and Paide, which operate on the Beisha line, have temporarily suspended service since December 28th. However, foreign ships with lighter loads, such as St. Louis, are still operating and calling as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e52">× English and American Goods Excluded Due to Monopoly of Occupied Area Market, Foreign Merchants Gather to Discuss Countermeasures <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] To retaliate against the active support of China by Britain and the United States, the Japanese side plans to increase tariffs in North China and monopolize the market for British and American goods. This is now brewing for implementation, and it is said that the exclusion of foreign goods in the guerrilla areas of Central China is particularly severe. According to news from customs officials and import and export companies in Shanghai, in the past month, British and American goods shipped to various lines of the Yangtze River for sale have been frequently inspected and detained by the local Japanese garrison, citing that they are not products of Japan and are not allowed to be sold, resulting in heavy losses for the companies. Those who refuse to unload the goods and return them to their place of origin must pay double the freight, resulting in considerable losses. As the Sino-American loan is about to be established, the Japanese army in various areas of Central China hates Britain and the United States even more, so the exclusion of foreign goods has become even more intense. In the past week, the shipment of British and American goods to various ports along the Yangtze River has become almost non-existent. Import and export companies and customs brokers are all wary and dare not easily declare goods. The Japanese ambition to monopolize the Far East trade market is increasingly exposed. It is heard that British and American merchants are now gathering to discuss effective countermeasures to maintain their economic interests in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Influx of Japanese Currency into Occupied Ports is Alarming</p>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Since the outbreak of the Japanese war of aggression against China, the domestic economic situation in Japan has fallen into extreme difficulties and is difficult to sustain. Therefore, the Japanese militarists and financial groups are implementing currency inflation domestically and actively engaging in economic aggression in the occupied areas of China, excluding third countries such as Britain and the United States from trading with China. At that time, a large amount of inflated Japanese currency and non-convertible Japanese military scrip were used to purchase agricultural products such as food and cotton, and an attempt was made to allow Japanese yen forces to invade the Chinese market. The entry of these Japanese yen scrips, which were declared to customs at occupied ports, amounted to 4.35 million yen in November of this year, and a total of 14.4314 million yen in the eleven months of this year, not including those transported by special ships.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Military and Political Figures Discuss the War Situation, Continued on Page 8 <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>"However, we are in a period of transition in this war situation. The rebirth of the symbolized China and the liberation of the nation is like the birth of a fetus, which must feel some necessary difficulties. In other words, the ×× robbers cannot destroy our country in one battle, but we also cannot quickly turn weakness into strength and immediately drive the ×× robbers out of the country. We can only adhere to a protracted war of resistance and strengthen domestic unity. This is the basic policy to overcome difficulties and truly enter the stage of victory..."</p>
<p>"Report: A guest is requesting to see the Minister—" Mr. Zhou's only attendant adjutant suddenly knocked on the door and said this, while handing over two business cards. Mr. Zhou invited the guest in. He wore the rank of captain and said that he had been educated by Mr. Zhou when he was studying at the ×× Military Academy. He is now serving in a certain unit and is preparing to go to the front, but unfortunately Guangzhou fell, and his family fled to Guilin. They have no food to eat, so he has come to ask Mr. Zhou for help. Mr. Zhou taught at the ×× Military Academy a long time ago, so he certainly could not remember this high-achieving disciple for a while. However, based on the spirit of "treating all people as brothers" and "teaching without discrimination," he first took a few refugee certificates from the begging disciple to look at and then sincerely said to the man: "Seeking help from others is not a fundamental solution. You should ask so-and-so three people to work, and someone to do a little business, to jointly support the remaining old woman and two children." After saying this, he generously opened his purse and gave him thirty yuan, telling him to let the designated person do a little business and not sit idle and squander the money.</p>
<p>We know that the salaries of the soldiers and officers of the Eighth Route Army, excluding food, are only two yuan for pocket money for soldiers and five yuan for officers per month. Mr. Zhou's money does not come easily, and there are many proper uses for it, which can be imagined from his earnest exhortations. However, the most important meaning is that whether a person is in normal or changing circumstances, it is important to have a spirit of self-reliance and self-help. If that officer and his family can thoroughly understand and put it into practice, the actual benefits they will receive will be inexhaustible for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>After that, Mr. Hu Yuzhi, a strong figure in the literary world, came to visit, and Mr. Chen Mingshu also sent someone to invite him to talk, so I had to say goodbye. Shaking hands before leaving, he suddenly asked me for a copy of "Inspection Notes on Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei." I was surprised that he would remember this booklet that I published five years ago, and at that time, I could only promise to mail it to him later for his review.</p>
<p>His only attendant adjutant was only fifteen or sixteen years old and was very polite to people. According to a friend, although he is young, he has been in battle for a long time and has learned a good marksmanship from practical experience. For example, if he wants to shoot you in the eye with a gun, the bullet will never slant into your eyebrow or bridge of your nose. If his marksmanship can be so accurate, it can truly be called a superb skill!</p>
<p>Guo Moruo on the New Stage</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Moruo's remarks echoed those of Mr. Bai Chongxi and Mr. Zhou Enlai, as if they came from the same source. Regarding his observation of the overall war situation, his views are as follows:</p>
<p>"As the war enters a new stage, our military and political authorities have made appropriate arrangements to maintain all the advantages of the previous stage as much as possible and to strictly correct the shortcomings. It is undeniable that there are many difficulties in the new stage, but there are ways to overcome them. All our citizens should reduce their standard of living. Whether participating in the war of resistance or not, whether in the front or the rear, whether in group life or private life, everyone should try their best to be frugal and serve the public. This is the most practical initial step to overcome difficulties and also the minimum salvation work that everyone should do and can do.</p>
<p>"In the new stage, the difficulties that the × side is increasing are even greater than ours. In the previous stage of the war of resistance, the × side had the advantage, which led to our loss of some land and people. However, we shattered the × people's dream of a 'quick victory' in the Battle of Shanghai, and even more ruthlessly shattered the × people's attempt to 'use Chinese to control Chinese' in the Battle of Xuzhou. By the Battle of Wuhan, the × people poured their naval, land, and air forces, and advanced along multiple routes, vainly hoping to achieve annihilation and suppression. However, we supported them with great fanfare for four or five months, so that after the × people's naval, land, and air forces were greatly depleted, we made a planned withdrawal from Wuhan and maintained our main force like a flawless jade box, so that the × people's dream of attacking Wuhan—the annihilation battle—was actually equal to an empty catch.</p>
<p>"In the previous stage of the war of resistance, we not only perfectly maintained our main force, so that we can expect to support the war, but on the other hand, we also safely moved many national factories in the north and south of the Yangtze River in Central China to the southwest hinterland, and established the economic sector in the whole anti-Japanese nation-building cause, and the government-run basic industries cooperated with each other, so that the anti-Japanese resources in the future can be produced by ourselves and can be obtained inexhaustibly and used inexhaustibly."</p>
<p>"In addition, objectively, the inconvenience of the × people's operations in the new stage, first, the larger the occupied area, the longer the battle line. The × people's forces are not enough to be allocated. On the contrary, the opportunities for us to take advantage of the weaknesses will gradually increase. Second, in the hinterland of our two major regions in the Northwest and Southwest, the use of the × people's naval, land, and air forces is restricted by the terrain, and it is absolutely impossible to get the convenience of smooth transportation as before in the coastal areas. And it will be difficult to find a central place like Xuzhou and Wuhan to give him a large-scale battle. If there is one, it will not be possible for him to have a chance to get annihilation results. As for our strength, whether in the front line or behind the × people, it is scattered everywhere and can operate individually. The × people want to defeat us one by one, and we can also fight independently and solve the × people individually. According to this stalemate situation, we can strengthen our struggle for a period of time, so that we can make full use of the characteristics of terrain, products, economy, and politics to increase our unlimited strength and advantages in the anti-Japanese war, and we can victoriously turn into the third stage. 　That is, the counterattack of the × people!"</p>
<p>After that, Mr. Guo also talked about some of the hidden dangers lurking in Japan and the unfavorable situation of the international community for Japan. 　Mr. 　　is a star in the modern cultural world and the leader of anti-Japanese literature. He now suddenly bears high-level political responsibilities, but he is still very concerned about cultural undertakings. He inquired in detail about the process of the resumption of publication of Shen Bao in Shanghai and the expansion of its Hong Kong version, expressing his pleasure. At the request of the reporter, he decided to write some articles and send them to Shen Bao for publication as soon as he had time from his official duties. I remember that at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Guo published a great work "Coming and Going in Bombing" in Shen Bao. Perhaps when the time comes to sweep away the × people. Maybe it's a good idea to write another article about "Recovering Lost Land in Bombing"?</p>
<p>The × people often spread rumors in Hong Kong and Shanghai, saying how our internal parties are rubbing against each other. When Mr. Guo heard this, he had a very relaxed answer at the time; he said: "Even loving couples will sometimes quarrel. What does it matter if the parties have a little friction? 　　In fact, because of Mr. Jiang's wise leadership, there has never been any friction between the parties after the Anti-Japanese War. In the future, because of the extension of the Anti-Japanese War and the increase of the responsibilities of the Anti-Japanese War, the united cooperation needed by all parties will inevitably increase its degree of sincerity."</p>
<p>In addition, I also heard from a friend in one of the three halls that a certain authority announced the political policy of the new stage of the Anti-Japanese War, which is to further unite the people's strength and cherish the material resources under the major premise of "military in politics," "matter in spirit," and "the people are more important than the soldiers," and to resettle the refugees. The political object is in the front, and the work is developed below. The shortcomings of the past, where the head was heavy and the bottom was light, must be corrected. At the same time, we must also train political cadres and talents, and train × 10,000 talents within a limited period of 　 years to be used as a solid foundation for the new stage of political work.</p>
<p>In short, our military and political authorities do have a new plan for the cause of anti-Japanese nation-building in the new stage, so that it can smoothly reach the realm of inevitable victory.</p>
<p>——The general passengers who were displaced to Hunan and Guangxi because of the Anti-Japanese War, especially the five or six car 　　from the lost areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and North China, are of course very concerned about the war situation related to the survival of the country and the nation. I was moved by the patriotism of the 　　and the enthusiasm of Mr. Bai Chongxi's speech, so I returned the courtesy and told them about the talks of Mr. Zhou Enlai and Guo Moruo as described in the previous article. Everyone listened in silence, and some even gave knowing smiles, so that the cold 　　dining car was filled with excitement and optimism in an instant!</p>
<p>The next morning (the third day after departing from Guilin), the car arrived at Santang, only one or two kilometers away from the junction with the Guangdong 　 Road—Hengyang. I don't know what it was thinking, but it stopped at Santang for a long time and didn't leave. I wanted to change my taste, so I got off the car to take a bus from Southwest Transportation Company. The car was transporting gasoline from Hengyang Jiang 　to this place, and it was transferred from the train to other places. 　Dozens of cars shuttled back and forth for several days, and it has not been completed yet. Although it is said that one drop of oil in wartime is better than one drop of blood, we can see a glimpse of our full preparation for this stuff. The driver's name is Huang. He is an overseas Chinese from Guangdong in Nanyang. He has prepared cars in Nanyang and learned driving technology. He started to serve in the Anti-Japanese Army. He agreed with a group of overseas Chinese patriotic comrades to find ways to return to China to serve, and each did what he could. He has been a driver for more than a year. It is said that he and other comrades used to get monthly salaries of about 100 yuan when they were doing business in Nanyang. After returning to China, each person only gets a salary of 36 to 42 yuan, but because it is the work of saving the country, they feel particularly happy in spirit.</p>
<p>The trees planted on both sides of the Hunan highway adopt the method of the Su Causeway of West Lake, and add the meaning of production, that is, "planted willows and cypresses alternately 　". At this time, the leaves of the paulownia tree fall, and the leaves of the willow tree turn yellow. Occasionally, a few trees of 　maple are dotted nearby, just like a beautiful natural autumn scene. The car drives through it, and it is really pleasing to the eye. However, the flowers of wartime have already bloomed among the branches and trees, that is, the signs and arrows of "No. × Automobile Field", "No. × Wounded Soldiers Hospital", and "Marching Rest Place", which will sometimes secretly jump 　into your eyes and pull your otherworldly fantasy back to "reality".</p>
<p>After a while, I saw Hengyang and stayed temporarily in Xinghua Village outside the city.</p>

<p>[Electric from Xingshi, Central News Agency, 4th] On the third, fierce battles raged on the Yellow River line between the × and us. Our artillery exerted its power, firing at the south bank. The × in Wencheng, 　　, and Zhongshi suffered numerous casualties. The × near Xiaochuanwo were fiercely intercepted by our machine guns and fled eastward. Our troops launched fierce attacks on Yifu and Mount Renzu, Mount Guantou, and other places. The × west of Xiaochuanwo, except for a small part, mostly retreated to 〇 County. The 2,000 × troops in Daning moved towards Pingdu Pass. The × in 〇 County planned to merge with the × forces in Daning to seek other crossing points.</p>
<p>[Electric from Xingshi, Central News Agency, 4th] At the beginning of last month, the × forces on the Tongpu Railway crossed the Fen River and invaded Fensi. Because our railway sided with the flanking attacks, the × took a defensive posture, waiting for reinforcements to act again. Until the next 　, Xixi 　　just stopped. The × successively gathered about 6,000 to 7,000 in Fenshui, 3,000 in Hongdong Zhaocheng, 6,000 in Linfen, 3,000 in Quhou Xingan, and more than 2,000 in Hejin Jishan. Since the 25th, they have launched a large-scale westward invasion. The first route took Fenxiao as its base, passed through Duijiugu, Damaojiao, and Shikou, and headed north to Shishou and south to Zuji. The trail of × was found along the Xinguandu River west of Shi. The second route took Linfen as its base, passed through Tumen Heilongguan, and invaded Puxian, Daning Yangkou Honglianggou Nanwanli, and other places. There were fierce battles in all places. The third route headed west from Nangling, occupied the front and back Guojiazhuang, and fled north after being met by our attack. A bloody battle was launched west of Chengnan Slope Pond. The × then converged with the × of Qinyuling and Heilongguan. In this battle, our regimental commander Wei Wu and battalion commander Gao Qu died in battle, and Zhao De 　regiment was defeated. The fourth route Quhou Xingan × north 　Quan Zhang San 　Zhao Kang and other places, our regiment marched from Kouping to Jiwang Mountain, attacking from north and south, the × troops hesitated and found it difficult to advance, our battalion commander Yuan Sandao died in battle. The fifth route took Hejin as its base, passed through Fancun, Guzhen, West 　Kou, Xipozhen, and Maozijin, and advanced north, attacking Yumen with its main force. 　Our general recovered Yumen, and the × fled to 　Shishi 　Tan, and occupied Niangniang Temple to the east, invading Xiangning Jixian, and then divided into 　to attack our Xiaochuanwo crossing. It was found that the × who invaded this time were the Taniguchi Mototsurao unit of the 118th Division. Most of the division was composed of old and weak soldiers. It suffered the greatest losses in Jiangxian Henglingguan Hengshui and other places in southern Shanxi. The entire 115th Regiment was annihilated by our Peng Division. In total, the entire division lost more than two-thirds of its strength. The former division commander and brigadier commander Nakano were also 　dismissed for their defeat in the Yuanqu battle. In this operation, in addition to 　new recruits, many 　Emperor's Cooperative Army such as Wang Ying and Zhang Renjie were also equipped. Now our army has recovered Hualezhen, Daning, Chuanzhuang, and other places west of Heilongguan. The × rear road has been cut off, and both sides are often attacked. After being frustrated in Xiaochuanwo, although they tried to find another crossing point in 　Du Guan or Xinguandu, they were afraid that they would not be able to do so.</p>
<p>[Mingge News Agency Xingshi 5th] This time, the number of × attacking Mount Lüliang was about 7,000 to 8,000. They began to move on the 25th, 26th, and 20th of last month. One route invaded Tumen Heilongguan from Linfen, and one route fled Guojiazhuang from Xiangling. The two routes were about 4,000 to 5,000 people. One route invaded Xiangning from Jishan, and one route invaded Yaoxi Gukou from Hejin. The two routes numbered about 4,000 to 5,000 people. The × attacking Guojiazhuang turned north after being severely attacked by our army and joined with the × in Linfen, invading Puxian Daning. Our Chen army attacked them from time to time along the way, suffering heavy casualties. In addition, Tumen Heilongguan were successively 　recovered by our army, and the × rear road was cut off, which was very Panic. The × in Jishan Beifan joined the × in Xigushan and successively invaded Xiangningji 　, and invaded the Yellow River to the west. After three days of fierce fighting, the × 　suffered a great defeat. The remnants of the × fled north, and there was a look of attacking Ping 　Guan with the × in Daning. At the same time, the × in Fenyang also increased by more than 5,000 last month. One part of 　supported Lishi Shiyang, and one part supported the × in Duijiugu, Xixian, and Zhongyang. On the 29th, they fled from Shijiazhuang to Shangguan and invaded Shishou. After being severely attacked by our army in Jinluozhen, the × in Lishi has not yet moved. It is said that a part of the × in Shishou fled to Xiguan 　, which is currently fighting with our unit.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Our Army Fiercely Attacks Zengcheng, The × Continue to Reinforce and Still Plan to Defend to the Death, Our Second Attack Kills Many × <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Awakening Society Shenzhen Express News] Our Eastern Route Army, led by Huang Xun, Wen Shuhai, Wu Daonan, and others, has been fiercely attacking Zengcheng in recent days, and has twice rushed into Zengcheng Street (county seat), breaking through the main force of the ×. However, the × continue to 　reinforce in an attempt to defend to the death. However, the troops reinforced by the × are all remnants of defeated soldiers from various battlefields. The soldiers have no fighting spirit, and their combat strength is extremely weak. It is really unbearable to attack. Therefore, since the 29th of last month, our army on the east bank of the Zeng River has once again launched an attack on the ×. There have been great gains in consecutive days, especially in the battles of Dayigang and Shetouling on one day, and the street fighting between our × and the northeast gate of Zengcheng. The battles were the fiercest. Our officers and soldiers were all extremely brave, and they only advanced and never retreated, so they killed × extremely 　. Now the Zengcheng × army has reported a total collapse, with thousands of casualties in the past ten days. Knowing that the general situation has passed, on the second 　they withdrew to Yiyao Taihe and Shitan on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Now there are no traces of × in the Zengcheng Zhucun Fuhe and Xietan areas. Our army has sent vanguard troops to search for the remaining × in the city, and the large army is advancing forward in a steady stream, continuing to contact our electricity on the left wing of Beitou and fiercely attacking Xizhou. At the same time, our army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is also determined to take advantage of the victory in Zengcheng, and urgently attack Shilong and Shitan, along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway straight to Guangzhou. Now the × army in Shit 　Shitan, because the outer defense line of Zengcheng was broken by us, and there is a large army of ours pressing down on the East River and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, will automatically abandon Shilong and Shitan, shorten the defense line, and firmly defend the northeastern suburbs of Guangzhou, Chepo Shipai Jijengkeng, and other areas, as an inner line war.</p>
<p>The Henan-Hubei × Army is at a Loss</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Luoyang 4th] There are less than 20,000 × puppet troops in northern Henan, mainly based on the 14th Division. Most of them are concentrated in the western section of Daoyan, Huojia Xiuwu, and Qinyang, attempting to threaten Zhengzhou Gongxian and Luoyang, eyeing western Henan. The eastern section of Daoqing and Xinxiang are all along the Beijing-Hankou line, and the × army is extremely scarce 　. The × army adopts a conservative policy on military affairs in northern Henan, so each is based on 　, and solid forts are built to prevent our attacks. In addition, several teams of infantry, cavalry, and artillery are combined to carry out guerrilla warfare in all directions. However, the × army is currently unable to invade the west.</p>
<p>[Every News Agency, Shanghai, Every 5th] According to Japanese reports, there are still a large number of Chinese troops active in the rear of the Japanese army. After the Japanese army carried out aerial reconnaissance, it was found that there were still many Chinese regular troops occupying various villages north of Yingkou and in the Dabie Mountains in the northeast. Therefore, the Japanese army will 　"clean up" this area, and it is impossible to avoid a major battle. Also, the Japanese front line north of Hankou is not long enough to prevent the Chinese army from taking advantage of the gaps.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 4th] Yangzhong County fell last spring. The traitor Gu Xianzhi took office as the puppet county magistrate and established various puppet organizations. Since the retreat of the enemy, Yangzhong has been manipulated by the puppet organization. The Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army entered and surrounded the puppet government last month, capturing more than 20 Chinese traitors and seizing more than 70 firearms. Yangzhong was thus recovered. However, Gu Xianzhi escaped. It is known that the Jiangnan Guerrilla Force attacked Changzhou on the 18th of last month and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy for several hours before safely withdrawing.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] Japanese aircraft flew over the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession this morning, dropping countless Chinese leaflets. These leaflets contained absurd remarks signed by leaders of various Chinese circles, stating that they were all willing to seek peace according to Wang Jingwei's proposal but were obstructed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It also claimed that Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi, and Ambassador to the US Hu Shi had telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting him to accept Wang's proposal.

<h3 id="e66">Observers from Various Countries Comment on the Political Turmoil in Japan, Saying Fascism Overthrowing Konoe, Military Setbacks Are the Real Cause <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 5th] Soviet officials believe that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet is actually a victory for Japanese fascism. The Japanese military believes that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek cannot be defeated, and Konoe is responsible for this. Therefore, the military is the main driving force behind the collapse of the Konoe cabinet.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The Evening Standard used a headline like "Fascists Overthrow Japanese Prime Minister" to report the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, but did not publish an editorial. Japanese people in London expressed regret over the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, saying that Konoe was very able to maintain a balance between all parties and resisted the demands of the extremists, especially those made after the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou. Many believe that Konoe was confident in his recent peace proposals to China, but he was actually greatly disappointed. This is probably the most recent reason for his resignation. As for Hiranuma, who succeeded him as Prime Minister, he is "the most extreme and untrustworthy nationalist." The resignation of Ikeda as Minister of Finance is considered a pity because he is considered by many to be the most competent member. These Japanese people are very concerned about the choice of successor. Many expect that Japan's two political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, will follow the events of the autumn of 1936 and the spring of 1937 and fiercely oppose the Japanese military's attempts to organize a new party and move towards fascism. If the military's plan is realized, the Japanese parliament will be reduced to a mere formality. Observers here believe that the new Japanese cabinet cannot last long. Chinese people here expressed their opinions to Reuters, saying that whoever takes power in Tokyo has little to do with us, because we must continue to resist. A government of extremists is actually beneficial to us because it will more easily incite internal rebellion in Japan.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] After the Japanese Konoe cabinet resigned en masse and Privy Council President Hiranuma was ordered to form a new cabinet, American officials commented, saying that Hiranuma is representative of the Japanese fascist faction. His succession as Prime Minister is intended to form a cabinet indispensable for continuing the war against China and conquering land. If economic sanctions were imposed on Japan at this time, the effect would be the greatest. As for the interests that the United States maintains in China, Japan has adopted various discriminatory measures and cut off traffic between Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and the Chinese mainland. Sino-American commerce has virtually come to a standstill. The US government may recall Ambassador Grew to Japan to report on the policies advocated by President Roosevelt in his message, namely, to deal with aggressive countries with strong measures, and discuss the implementation methods, which may not be avoided.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Germany is paying close attention to the resignation of the Japanese cabinet and the formation of a new cabinet and believes that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet will strengthen Japan's foreign policy. However, officials do not want to comment on anything before the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet. The Berliner Tageblatt stated, "Konoe's resignation is enough to make people understand what the Japanese newspapers said last year, that Japan's foreign policy in 1939 will be unified, and that military, economic, and diplomatic policies will be adjusted." The newspaper reviewed Konoe's cabinet in the past, believing that the demand for the unification of Japanese foreign policy has not yet been realized.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] After an emergency meeting of various officials, Army Minister Itagaki planned to submit seven demands to the government: 1. The policy towards the China Incident must be fully implemented in accordance with the Imperial Conference and the declaration of December 22nd. 2.

<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Still on the train in Hunan and Guangxi. The rain continues to fall, sometimes mixed with hail the size of rice grains and beans, making a clanging sound against the train car.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Dong'an Station, we entered Hunan Province. Looking around, the mountains are gentle, and there are many paddy fields, a landscape very different from Guangxi. Lengshuitan is a large town in Lingling County and also a large station on the Hunan-Guangxi Railway. Electric wires crisscross like a web, and the houses are clustered together in a large area. Since this is an important town, there are traitors active here. A few minutes before the train arrived at the station, the railway police arrested a blatant traitor. He was wearing a fake Hunan-Guangxi Railway employee badge, and hiding symbols of other units, and also carrying a check from a certain bank. He was suspected of inquiring about various situations at the station and was arrested. He confessed immediately, a case of walking right into the net.</p>
<p>Also, in a certain place not far from here, which was previously attacked by enemy aircraft, someone first waved a white towel and then used the towel to cover his mouth. He was captured by the stationed troops and had both ears cut off. However, during interrogation, he stubbornly denied being a traitor. He said he covered his mouth with a white towel because he saw enemy aircraft being hit by bullets and emitting smoke, mistakenly believing that it was releasing poison gas, so he covered his mouth to prevent poisoning. The interrogating officer believed him and apologized to him, also compensating him for medical expenses, and released him. Who knew that he was deeply poisoned by the enemy's temptation. Later, he went to do this again and was arrested again. Since he had his ears cut off as a mark last time, and this time the enemy aircraft was not hit by bullets and did not emit smoke, he could not use the old excuse. Of course, he had to submit to the law.</p>
<p>On the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, a group of traitors was also captured. They were a large-scale northern-style acrobatic troupe, with more than ten men and women in total. They thought to come to South China to spy on military intelligence. The local authorities had obtained intelligence early on, but they could not grasp their conclusive evidence. Later, they spent a lot of effort to examine the tire of the unicycle that they used to ride on the tightrope when they performed, and found secret documents, which satisfactorily solved the case.</p>
<p>In short, all those who are traitors will not have a good end. Small traitors who send signals for three or five cents at a time are certainly not worth it. Even those big traitors who can get an official position will eventually lose out. Because the capital, their head, is in danger of being lost, what profit is there to be made? Moreover, "the cunning rabbit dies, the hound is cooked." If the masters are unhappy, they will also put you to death. At this point, it is even more difficult to rest in peace even as a ghost!</p>
<p>At night, the express train stopped again at a station. Everything was very quiet, and we seemed to be staying in a long, narrow hotel. The reporter and the passengers casually chatted again. There were five or six car attendants in the dining car. They were all educated in elementary school or junior high school, and were now reading books and talking after finishing work. One of them was smarter and was transferred from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He said he had met me on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi train before. He asked me: Did you go to hear Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Headquarters give a speech to the students in Guilin yesterday? He said that he had gone to listen himself, and then he took out his diary and looked at it, recounting the speech that Mr. Bai gave on it, from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The outline of Mr. Bai's speech first explained comprehensive tactics, saying that everyone, regardless of gender or age, should enthusiastically rush to the battlefield. No matter the location, east, west, north, or south, whether it is the front or the rear, they must be fully mobilized to directly and indirectly strike at the enemy. On the battlefield, we do not compete for "points" and "lines," but compete for "surfaces." He then pointed out the strategic stages of this war of resistance. The period before the fall of Yueyang was the first stage, and after that was the second stage. In the second stage of the war, we must defeat the enemy's puppet organizations in the occupied areas, establish strong governments, and strive for full control. We must make the enemy unable to advance or retreat, and suffer the failure of Napoleon's attack on Moscow.</p>
<p>It is a pity not to listen to Mr. Bai's correct and important speech (Editor's note: This newspaper has already published the full text). However, the reason why I did not go to listen was because I had another appointment beforehand, which was to visit Mr. Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department, and Mr. Guo Moruo, Director of the Third Department of the Political Department. Secondly, I had to pack my luggage, so he missed the opportunity. Of course, the talks of Mr. Zhou and Mr. Guo also need to be published for reference.</p>
<p>A Meeting with Zhou Enlai</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Mr. Zhou Enlai is a meritorious official who single-handedly created the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan together. At the same time, he is also a world-renowned contemporary statesman. The reporter had visited him once before, and Mr. Ye Jianying was also present on one occasion. Unfortunately, there were too many people visiting him, so we did not have the chance to talk freely for five minutes. Of the several questions I prepared to ask him, he only answered part of the topic of "the current situation of the war of resistance."</p>
<p>He said: "Our current situation in the war of resistance is indeed as Chairman Chiang said: 'We have already entered the second stage.' This method of staging is viewed from a strategic point of view. In the past, the stages of the war of resistance were divided as the first stage from the beginning of the war to the fall of Nanjing, the second stage to the fall of Xuzhou, and the third stage to the fall of Wuhan. This was divided from a tactical perspective, but it is better to divide it from a strategic point of view for application. Previously, the enemy adopted a strategy of quick war and quick resolution, hoping to make us surrender in one battle, accept the alliance under the city, and embark on the road to national subjugation. However, our achievements in the war of resistance for sixteen months have shattered this strategy and political strategy of theirs completely.</p>
<p>"The enemy has repeatedly tried to lure our forces, concentrating dozens of divisions on one point, such as the major battles in Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Wuhan. The enemy did not hesitate to pay a heavy price and wanted to annihilate our main force. However, the result of each major battle was that because we were able to flexibly deploy strategic and tactical resources, exchange space for time, and create a foundation for long-term resistance. Not only was our main force not annihilated by it, but it was also full of vitality, flourishing, and growing rapidly. We must ensure that the frontline defense has troops to continue fighting, and at the same time, the rear can quickly step up the establishment of a new modernized national defense force, especially in the enemy's rear in the war zone, dispatching capable troops to develop large-scale guerrilla warfare. For example, in the five provinces of North China, until now, more than two-thirds of the cities are still in the hands of our troops and people. The people of Guangdong have been organized to participate in guerrilla warfare. Many traitor maintenance societies have been destroyed, many traitor leaders and puppet county chiefs have been assassinated, and many puppet army security teams have revolted. If this situation continues to develop, turning the enemy's rear into the front line and launching a full-scale general counter-offensive, wouldn't we be stepping into the door of victory?"</p>
