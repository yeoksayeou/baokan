<h3 id="c1">英蘇法軍事同盟的影響 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>據倫敦昨日電訊，英國官方業已證實：英國已同意與蘇聯成立防衛軍事同盟；又傳法國將為同盟的一分子，土耳其亦有加入的情勢。這樣一來，陰晴無常的歐洲反侵略陣綫的締結，算巳明朗化，反侵略陣綫的基礎也從這兒完全鞏固，所以英蘇法軍事同盟的成立，意義非常之大。其影響也極廣泛，將不只限於歐洲，且將及於遠東。</p>
<p>據英方的消息，蘇聯大槪將在兩項條件之下加入同盟：其一，在相互動作的基礎上決定三國共同的措施，其意思就是，三國中任何一方受到侵略時，其他兩國應卽出而援助；其二，對於保證其他國家問題，三國將同意任何其他國家如受浸犯，而確已竭力抵抗侵略，且已呼籲援助者，三國應傾其全力，以援助該被侵略的國家。只照這內容看來，英蘇法的軍事同盟，至少將有下列幾種影響：</p>
<p>一，歐洲反侵畧陣綫將以這個英蘇法的軍事同盟為基礎而健全樹立起來，其他各弱小國家且將爭先參加這個同盟，或附屬這個同盟集團，因為他們此後已有充分的可靠的保證了。前此，東歐諸小國乃至北歐及東歐的有些弱小國家，皆因英國過去保證的不十分可靠而徘徊不定，加以德意的拉攏頗有反投侵畧者的懷裏去的可能。但是現在蘇聯的條件若被採納，則保證可充分，自然願意離去虎穴，而就安樂窩。</p>
<p>二，英蘇法軍事同盟將大大影響及於遠東，意即我們所强調反侵畧陣綫不能不包括遠東一項，也將從此開展。我們的論據；同盟上將規定三國中任何一方受到侵略時，其他兩國應卽出而援助，而英蘇法在遠東方面處處皆有被東方侵略者侵略的可能，是則世界反侵略陣綫自不能獨限於歐洲了。這裏，更因為遠東也有不少的弱小國家希望受到强國的保證，而美國主張又最烈，於是美國也就極自然地或早或晚加入反侵畧陣綫將更加强。</p>
<p>三、同盟的集團，也卽侵略集團與反侵略集團將更集中化，其對立情勢也更明朗化，形成第一次歐戰前同盟對立的情勢。德意軍事同盟已於昨晨正式簽字，這個情勢逼成英蘇法軍事同盟，其次，預料德意咸將於不久的將來逼日本參加三國軍事同盟，再次反侵略或有被侵略危險的國家，也將繼續加入英蘇法同盟集團。</p>
<p>在這情勢下最堪注意的，是我們×人的外交動向。他們的外交放針截至今日確是成立兩派：（一）元老重臣等穩健派雖尚不贊成率然加入德意日三國軍事同盟因而開罪於英美法等民主國家，（二）但是少壯派軍人却强調加入，最近「國民新聞」一貫的主張和中國淪陷區的積極排英，卽其明證。但却苦壞了左右為難的平沼老頭子，直至今日還含糊其詞，謂「日本國策乃建基於正義道德之上」，是也云苦矣！</p>
<h3 id="c2">最近我國教育文化事業　邊疆教育　經費續有增加　設施多所推進 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（重慶特訊）敎部自民十九成立蒙藏敎育司，對於邊彊敎育，卽積極進行，歷來已有相當成續，茲探錄其槪要於下：</p>
<p>（邊教經費）</p>
<p>關於邊疆教育經費之籌劃與分配，在民二十、二十、二十二等年教部曾與蒙藏委員會數度商討，推行邊疆敎育方案，終以每年經費預算僅有五萬元，除由蒙委會分別補助邊疆原有成續優良學校　校，補助邊疆學生升學，並酌量補助邊彊文化團體外，巳無餘狄可資分配，所擬計劃，均無任實現，敎部鑒於邊彊問題複雜，若不亟　樹立文化基礎，政敎建設，恐將無法進行，爰於二十四年，在補助邊遠省瘠省份經費內，指定以五十萬元，作為辦理邊敎之用，二十六年度，增為六十四萬元，指定六項用途，（一）補助成績優良學校，（二）訓練師資，（三）增設小學，（四）增設社敎機關，（五）補助邊地學生升學，（六）編譯並印刷敎科圖書。</p>
<p>（學校教育）</p>
<p>敎部補助設立之邊彊學校，計甘肅省立蘭州鄉師附設蒙藏囘師資訓練班一班，小學五十五所，靑海省立西寗蒙藏簡師一所，中學二所，小學一百四十三所，　夏省立蒙旗師範班二班，小學十四所，西康省立康定簡易師校一朋，小學五所，雲南省立邊地簡易師校三所，（據報十所，惟尚無詳細報告到部，故僅就已報者開列），小學三十五所，貴州省立貴陽鄉師一抆，小學十二所，四川省立屛山，茂縣簡師二所，小學十五所，湖南省立湘西特區師資訓練班一所，短期小學一百所，新疆省立迪化師範附設蒙囘師範五班，及阿克蘇簡師一府，小學一千四百十二所，綏遠省設有國立綏遠蒙旗師範一校，補助土默特　旗立中學一所，小學二十九所，察哈爾省立蒙旗小學十三所（現察全停，綏僅有小學四所，繼續開學，）廣西省立特種資師訓練所一所，小學五百四十一所，西藏拉薩市立第一小學一所，總計師範十二校，又九班，中學二校，小學三千二百七十校。</p>
<p>（社會教育）</p>
<p>敎部補助設立之社敎機關，計有寗夏省立蒙旗敎育巡迴工作團一團，拉卜楞藏民文化促進會巡迴施敎隊一隊，蒙古文化館一處（已停辦）察哈兩省第二巡迴社會敎育舘一處，（已停辦）及察哈爾十二旗羣立蒙古編譯館一處，（已停頓）寺廟敎育：教部為改進寺廟敎育曾會同蒙藏委會，通令各邊省敎廳。及蒙藏地方政府督促當地各寺廟，設立民衆學校或補習學校，以為附近民衆及憎侶經生等求學之所，囘敎淸真寺，附設阿文學校，亦曾令增加國語常識及算術等科目並利用各寺廟講經時間，作精神演講，與識字運動，並對於喇嘛和尚阿　等，設法予以訓練。</p>
<p>（學生優待）</p>
<p>敎部為鼓勵蒙藏囘學生升入內地專科以上學校起見，於二十五年起劃撥專欵予以補助，每人每年補助三百元，此外並另酌發旅費，計每年補助者，平均各數十人。文化講座：敎部為溝通漢藏文化，於二十六年在中央，淸華，武漢，中山，北京等五大學，增設西藏文化講座，特聘西藏格西喜饒嘉錯担任。敎科編譯：邊邊疆情形特殊，語文各異、普通敎科不能適用，由敎部另行編譯，印發應用，計現已編就「漢蒙合璧」敎科書，小學國語八册，常識四册，三民主義千字課四本，短期小學課本四册，「漢藏合璧」敎科書，小學國語四冊，民衆學校課本四册，「漢囘合璧」小學敎科書三册，此外審定西康呈送之漢藏合璧敎科書八册，及漢藏敎理院呈送之漢藏文讀本五冊，惟內容禾臻完善，現已設法改編中。</p>
<p>（改進事項）</p>
<p>（一）「邊敎設施範圍之擴大，」查邊疆民族複雜，文化落後，各地情形均屬不同，不獨蒙蔽地方，須適應環境施敎。即新疆之囘族，靑海土番及西南邊地各族，其語文風習。均與內地逈異。自應視其實際需要，以推進各地之敎育，俾收效較易，故敎部蒙　司工作範圍，已遍及邊區各地，（二）混合敎學訂正名稱，邊疆敎育之目的，在于國族文化之融合，如各立名目，標明標點　無異將中華之整個國族自行分散，抑各族學生，若各自單獨敎學，感情亦無法聯絡，故敎部通令邊彊各校，應以地名為校名，招收學生，不限族別，混合敎學，以冺除各族之界限，（三）「以國語為敎學之中心」少數民族，情感隔開，其主要原因，為語文不同，故邊疆敎育，首先任務，必須使邊疆人民通為國文國語則無謂之隔關，可無形消滅，（四）『邊敎事業』，逐漸由補助辦法，變為中央直接辦理，邊彊各地，因政治未上軌道，邊敎推行，諸多障碍，故敎舊一方設法整理原有敎育機關，繼續予以補助，一方逐漸設國立師範，以統制師資，設實驗小學，以輔導地方敎育，設國立中學，以吸收靑年，設邊區　校，以培養建設人才，設邊彊學校，以為研究及推進各區敎育之中心，如是則邊敎專業可逐漸由中央統制，俾能在一定計劃與方針之下，順利進行</p>
<p>成人教育</p>
<p>廣西注力推行　各省大可效法</p>
<p>【桂林通訊】柳江是廣西九十九縣里面相當重要的一縣，全縣面積為七千一百八十二方里，共分五鎭三十鄉，四百二十九村街，二十三萬八千八百餘人口，當中失學成人為一萬八千七百六十七人，（係據二十七年三月的統計）柳江縣政府奉令舉辦成人敎育後，便决定了下列七個辦法。</p>
<p>成立推行委會</p>
<p>（一）成立推行成人敎育委員會，該會巳在本月一日正式宣告成立，專門負責推行成人敎育，務期於本年內，掃除文盲，普及民衆敎育，加强民衆動員工作，發揮抗戰建國力量，（二）宣傳，由各村街長，學校敎員以及熱心敎育人士，於村街民大會或其他集會時，努力宣傳成人敎育重要性，柳州日報業巳出版「成人戰育專刊」，擴大宣傳，使民衆自動踴團參加。</p>
<p>訓練成教師資</p>
<p>（三）訓練師資，全縣共有四百二十九村街，每村街須專任成人敎師一人，共須成人敎師四百二十九人，又因本年成人敎育與過去的狹義的識字運動，補習敎育不同，所以關於師資方面，不得不成立師資訓練班，將所有師費作短期訓練，第一期除分別抽調各鄉鎭小學敎師訓練外，並實行考試制度，拔取眞才，計本期訓練師資共一百六十餘人，該班業已上課，開畢上課，訓練十日後，卽行分赴合鄉鎭村街，担任成人敎育工作，（四）設立成人敎育班，全縣共有四百二十九村街，每村街頭預定設成人班一班咸兩班，設專任敎師一人，月給生活費國幣十元，於兩班結束後，幷另津貼國幣五元，人數規定，每班最少三十人，最多不得超過六十人，（五）設立表證成人班，這是本省成人敎育方案第八條所規定，每縣應特約中等學校，咸成續優良之中心學校，舉辦表證成人班，現本縣巳决定由柳州省立初級中學和私立龍城初級中學，各設立　證成人班一班，以為他校表。　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c3">日×在華北的經濟刦奪　續昨 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>濫發紙幣之外，並盡量吸牧紙幣。吸方法亦有多種，太原×特務機關長谷荻那華雄佈告；向來市面通行之中國銀行及交通銀行發行之紙幣，除其票面上印有天津，青島，游擊者外，一律限于六月十日，（去年）以前兌成中國準備銀行紙幣。但實際上中國民衆對偽紙幣的不信任。巳否定了此種辦法的有效，老百姓寧　蒙家中，亦不兌偽幣，所以日×吸收法幣的方法，只有藉助于苛捐雜稅與肆行掠奪而已。</p>
<p>乙、設置晨貸機關：</p>
<p>日×在各地普遍的設置農貸機關，實際上也是為了遂行剝創而已。</p>
<p>偽河北省銀行去年六月間，在河北滄縣，辦理農貨，共投費的十五萬元，農民借貸均須依照定章，以地契作押，限期　還，至期不還者，卽將土地沒收</p>
<p>在日×等苛捐雜稅壓榨下的農民大衆，又怎能如期償還利息加倍的借貸呢？結果只有土地被日×沒收了。</p>
<p>二，實業方面</p>
<p>甲，偽臨時政府整理既存礦業權：</p>
<p>偽臨時政府于去年六月間，廢止民國二十一年修正現行礦業法的一切規定，按原定礦業公司其過半股分須歸中國人所有，董事過半數及董事長總經理，須以中國人充當，煤，鋼，銅，煤油等以國營為原則……等條例，對日×的經濟陰謀，當然有所阻礙，偽臨時政府以『此種規定為排外的條項』為口實，索性整個廢棄了！既存礦業權中完至解消，並重新頒佈偽『礦業法條例』，關於礦業的轉移及其他關聯處分，非經偽政府特許，一概無效，於此萬人所經營的一切煤礦鐵礦等企業，完全移人日×之乎。</p>
<p>乙，積極開發華北實業：</p>
<p>偽日華經濟協議會于去年五月間，卽擬就開發華北實業的具體方案，茲特介紹如下：</p>
<p>一，『農村復與計劃案』</p>
<p>華北農村開發九年計劃，以棉花增產一千萬相，小麥增產一億二千八百萬祖為目標……</p>
<p>一，合作社組織案，</p>
<p>華北農業實行機關合作社，係以各鄉村為單位的單位合作社，其上有縣聯合會，這聯合會，省聯合會，中央聯合會，組織一系統的合作社，由實業部新民會担任技術的指導。</p>
<p>一，棉花增產計劃案：</p>
<p>設置華北棉產協會，作為担任實行棉花增產計劃的直接的指導獎勵機關，並决定『九年增產計劃』</p>
<p>一，農業試驗場統一案：</p>
<p>將從來散在各省的農業試驗場，分別統合改由省或縣營，置于外務省文化事業部的統治下，以圖增進農業……』</p>
<p>一，華北產業中如交通、通信、電汽、鐵礦，採炭，製鹽與曹達工業石炭液化七項，因關重要定為統制合業。</p>
<p>一、歡迎第三國資金之參加。</p>
<p>偽日華經濟協會，於去年九月開四次會决定『經濟提携大綱』三項：一、棉花增產，二、促進貿易，三、開發產業，在開發產業項內，特別指明「對華北重要產業、煤鐵，電力，鹽，及石炭液化等五種事業須盡量開發」這五種事業。是軍事工業上的必需品，日×準備長期侵略戰爭，於此可見。除此以外，其他各種實業的開發，也鄒帶有戰時的性質。日×的目的，一方面為了榨取，一方面為了軍事。現在我們將在華北數省已創設的日×的實業機關及榨取情况，略述梗槪，以見日×經濟侵略的陰謀。</p>
<p>（一）煤礦：華北煤藏量之鹽富，首推山西，煤質分有煤煙無煤煙兩種，產地以娘子關裏外為別，關外井陘等地所產為『有烟煤』普通叫「烟煤』關裏陽泉等地所產為『無煙炭』自太原失守後，日×卽積極開採，去年撥劃歸偽軍管理第四工廠管理，該廠接收陽泉保晉公司後，卽將該工廠管理礦區劃為十四處，幷徵集多數工人，績極採掘。</p>
<p>太原附近東山西山煤礦區，藏量亦頗豐富，既屬于僞軍管理第五工廠開發，去年十月間，×實行經濟封鎖後。指定偽柳大公司獨家專賣，柳大公司在太原首義門外，開設大存煤廠經營販責。</p>
<p>晉北大同口泉煤礦。歸偽北自治政府管理，晉南　縣靈石中間之富家　煤礦，亦劃為偽軍管理第四十二工廠，準備發掘。</p>
<p>河北產煤亦頗富饒，日×以開灤烟媒與×製鐵事業。有密切關係，于上年九月投資五百萬元，擬定增產計劃，現在年產額在五百萬噸以上。</p>
<p>山東煤礦在膠濟路沿綫的，概歸偽靑島魯大礦產公司管理，幷將前華商總理的各炭礦，辦行接收，該公司過去年產額達三百萬噸以上，事變後銷路阻滯。降為百萬噸左右，最近日×决加以復興，投資七百萬元。現各礦區每月出煤量，博山四百噸，大昆倫八百噸，洪山二百噸，普樂，坑子，等約五百噸。（二）鐵礦：日×對于鐵礦的開採，甚為重視，二十六年底，卽四寇興中公司開始發　宣化，龍烟鐵礦，並在烟簡山礦區設立公司管理，將材料廠亦行擴大。此外更在龍關縣屬三叉口——辛窰等處礦區開採礦石。</p>
<p>此外，日×深感鐵礦之需要，去年十一月，×三井，三菱，大倉三社曾在華北各地大量搜集碎鐵，古銅，制錢，碎鉛，彈殼等，搜集極夥。</p>
<p>（三）金鑛：河北遵化縣之金鑛，蘊藏極富，過去冀東政府時代，曾有多數小規模開採公司，惟因資本薄弱，　用土法，因之幾完全停業，去年七月，×興中公司與住友會社，合組一華北採金公司，在天津成立，從事開採遵化之金鑛。</p>
<p>山西代縣金鑛，過去亦用土法開採聞最近日×已派某公司技師前往確實調查過，想亦有發掘的企圖。</p>
<p>（四）電氣事業：日×在華北的電氣事業，尚無任何發展，最近日×聲稱將在北平成立『電氣委員會』，在電氣方面，稍有改進，去年七月，察綏滿洲與華北方面，開始有電報聯絡，不過聯絡方法，不僅仰給於郵電總局採取之對外電訊連絡方法，察綏與滿洲聯絡，使用張家口，大同兩電報局的無綫電機，華北與綏察聯絡，則用張家口與北平之原有電綫，後於九月間在張家口承德間，又架設自動二層電綫。</p>
<p>電氣事業的必需原料石油，日×加以統制，去年七月設立「華北石油統制會社」，牧買舊大華火油公司，並購入原油，加以精製販賣。</p>
<p>（五）食鹽：久為縣案的長蘆鹽田，子去年六月由興中公司决定加以開發，計劃為一窩五千『町步』的新鹽田之開發，並將洗滌鹽工廠的能力亦加續充，七月初，又將東大誥子鹽　子橋南的廢鹽灘，加以整理，預訂去年春季可以正式出鹽。</p>
<p>自日×統制食鹽後，民衆很感食鹽的缺乏，同時在日商欺騙壓榨之下，市價高抬，民衆食鹽，遂意為困難，去年以來河北沿海一帶，滄縣鹽山等地農員，多私自晒製硝鹽。附近民衆爭相販賣。後被日×偵悉，以為影響于長蘆鹽銷路至鉅，卽將各地鹽田及鹽池等完全沒收。興中公司並决定利用滄鹽地區原有鹽民，開發工業用鹽，專門供給×國內亶達工業，硝子工業及一切化學工業的需要。</p>
<p>山西運城之盬池，產量亦甚饒，過去除供給晉南以外，陝甘河南等地亦仰給於此，去年三月×佔領運城，卽將該地鹽池之河東鹽，完全沒收，更徵集　工從事　製，但以鹽池周　為我游擊部隊出沒之地，一般鹽工所工作的時間與　製的鹽田面積，均不遠往。所以產量不多，現山西各地食鹽尚多係長蘆鹽。</p>
<p>山東沿海一帶亦多產鹽，靑島近海處，產鹽更多，每年靑島鹽對日興朝鮮之輸出額凡達千窩噸左右。</p>
<p>（六）農產：除上述各部門外，華北的農產開展，亦在積極進行，日×食糧缺乏，企圖從中國方面徵集，所以奪佔察綏以後，卽由偽蒙區聯合悉織會與偽察南蒙聯晉北三自治政府先修正土地法及土地整理法，凝定三年計劃，各偽政府為設置中央試騐場。</p>
<p>在太原方面，自去年七月初，卽統制雜箱運輸出境，並設立『雜糧運輸組合』，但事實上均為日方操縱。華商加入組合，盡皆虧本，後華商幾度要求組合員以外輸出的許多，均被駁回。結果華商多數退出組合，却暗將食糧輸往游擊區中，日×感食糧恐慌，常派士兵到鄉村中掠奪，這是日×最感惶惑的一個嚴軍問題。</p>
<p>（七）棉產：棉產物也是軍需品之一，日×向來卽大半仰給於中國，奪　河北後卽設置『河北棉產改進會』，擬定五年增產計劃，設立『華北棉花公司』，並積極整理正定，彰德，濟南，石家莊等地方棉花市場打倒工廠。</p>
<p>日×初未料到中國民衆多半參加了戰，雖然苦心經營，但是結果戰後一年的產額，遠遜于事變以前，供不應求，棉價高漲，華北棉花在大阪收貨之價格，較之美棉約高千餘元之譜，日×想幾次增進對日輸出，但結果却形成全面交易的輸出杜絕的狀態。日×力拙技窮，於此可見。</p>
<p>去年底日×外務特務兩省與偽臨時政府，曾計劃設置華北棉花增產指導機關，總會設北平各省設分會。再于各縣設支會，擬定今年卽將成立。</p>
<p>（八）麵粉：供給山西各地×偽軍政機關麵粉的是太原偽軍管理第二第七兩工廠，卽前電燈公司與麵粉公司兩廠舊址，現在產量雖不及過去，但以日×買小麵麥時，往往不必公取公買，所以當然有利可圖，這是日×抓取的一般方式。</p>
<p>太原以外，在山西設置的麵粉工廠尚有三處，臨汾為偽軍管理第三十一工廠，裝飾電輪汽磨，早遠為偽軍管理第三十工廠，規模較小，工人僅數十，榆次（北門外，舊晉豐麵粉工廠，亦劃歸偽軍管理第十二工廠，去年十二月，偽軍管理第七工廠復將運城的舊晉豐麵粉公司第二工廠，修理恢復，企圖於最近開工。</p>
<p>山東×區內規模最大的麪粉工廠，當首推日商三井系之三吉靑島麪粉公司，現在三吉之直屬工廠，計有靑島，濟南天津三工廠，其業已委任經營的尚有濟南之家鹽，靑島之中央，雙扶等工廠</p>
<p>（九）煙酒：抗戰以後，平津紙煙公司，十九倒閉，因各種紙煙原料，大部採自內地，游擊戰的普遍的展開後，往×區運輸原料，遂成絕不可能，因而各公司因原料缺乏無織工作，同時在日×强取盜奪之下，亦無織存在，結果只有倒閉，紙煙的一般漲價，原因卽基於此。</p>
<p>平津酒業亦復如是，中國酒商遂漸滅跡，西洋輸入之酒亦較前减少，充斥市上的，幾完全由×國輸來，尢其麒麟牌，太陽脾等最多。</p>
<p>去年九月寇華北煙葉株式會社發起組織，華北煙草統制會社，總公司設靑島，北平及東京設辦事處，對于煙葉的買賣，倉庫業運輸業的管理，均由該偽會社統制經營，同時山東方面，亦設立偽山東煙葉股份有限公司，社長為×松尾晴冠，係由東亞滿洲兩煙草公司合賣組成。</p>
<p>山西烟葉亦採統制辦法，並禁止外省絲烟輸入，極意經營偽軍營理第十三工廠（卽前晉華捲烟廠舊址），但以原料缺乏，銷路停滯，營業甚為寰落所出牌號有旭牌，黎明，協和，幸福四種，以美麗的包裝盒封入宣傳性的畫片，並注入毒品，上年六月曾由民衆吸食，此種捲煙，往往中毒斃命，日×陰謀之危毒，一至於此。</p>
<p>（十）酒精與洋炭：在華北日×稍具規模的酒精廠，首推大同酒精廠，偽晉北自治政府將由西北實業公司經營的酒精製造廠重加整頓，易名為「晉北興農酒精廠」，上年八月初開始工作，當地偽組織盡量徵集豆類高梁包米以為製造原料。</p>
<p>華北洋灰業，過去多為唐山啓新洋灰公司所獨佔，年產額約在三十萬噸以上，事該後由于治安及運輸的關係，其產額大為减少。太原方面，日×將舊西北洋灰廠委×淺野灰會社經營，現在修理中，濟南方面，致敬水泥公司亦為×盤城灰會社接收，惟產量甚微。</p>
<p>（11）火柴業：北平偽臨時政府于去年十一月曾在『火柴聯營社』擬定具體方案，其綱要分（一）限制生產，（二）取締私貨，（三）集中發賣三點。但究其目的，却不外在統製整個華北火柴企業而巳，靑島為火柴最發達之地，華北火柴廠，振業火柴廠，靑靑火柴公司等均先後為日商獨佔，於上年九月間，開始營業，平津一帶，多於此間織往</p>
<p>靑島火柴公司等規模最大的要算「華北火柴公司」，係由前靑島火柴公司改組而成，董事長為×宇田川，副董事長如楊遵圭。</p>
<p>（十二）皮革羊毛：華北皮革之盛，首推綏遠，現在軍事繁急時期，皮革羊毛及軍用必需品，所以日×對於晉綏畜牧事業極為重視，其目的就在抓取大量的皮革羊毛。供供他作戰的需要。</p>
<p>皮革由於羊毛的重要，便注意到畜產問題。日×照例寶行統制辦法，偽察南政府民生廳于去年八月，即禁止畜產的輸出、一面訓令各警察機關嚴于監視，一面在平綏綫康莊車站，設置畜產監視　，嚴禁私意出入。</p>
<p>西羊皮之統制專買權歸偽軍管理第十六廠（舊西北實業公司毛織廠遺址），在該廠內設有購買本部重榆次忻縣平遙新降曲沃孝義等縣，均設置購買所。其收買價格，由太原×特務機開規定，如該工廠不需要時，其餘可得以輸出，但還必須經×特務　關之許可方法實行。</p>
<p>山西皮革之產量，為華北第一，一九三六年度牛皮為二百四十五萬四千枚，羊皮為八百九十五萬六千枚，由于日×企圖為軍用品製作捉供的陰謀，其收買處已委諸偽軍管理第十七工廠（西北實公業司遺址），並在榆次壽陽汾陽臨汾新絳等地設購買分所，交易則以物交易為主，現物到來，則以金票交換支給，又以皮革為軍需原料，附有重要性，購買時須與×軍當局有所聯絡，聽從×軍之指示命令。</p>
<p>山東偽省府建設廳于去年九月設立，『種畜改良場』，另設畜疫防治所，但以規模甚小，無若何成績績。</p>
<p>最後</p>
<p>綜觀日×在華北的種種陰謀，在經濟方面，正在加緊榨取與開發佔領地的資源與財富，同時用各種方法破壞搗亂中國的經濟財政，以求摧毀中國抗戰物質基礎；在國際貿易方面，日×自握取海關及交通要道後，盡力排擠英美商業，傾銷日貨，在財政方面，盡量發行偽聯合準備銀行鈔票，强迫民衆使用並追以沙幣兌換，企圖收買法幣更偽造法幣私換外匯，强制訂定偽幣之外匯價格，希圖擾亂中國之金　。這是日×經濟優略的總陰謀，其侵略的部門，凡屬于日×公司的活動且有相當的成績的已如遠。屬于秘密性質，雖在積極計劃中，而無若何成續的，故暫從闕。以俟後日再續。（民革社）</p>

<h3 id="c13">海豐速寫 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 小鳴</p>
<p>海豐為東江的大邑，在革命時代，曾經有　驚人的事跡，當廣惠汕公路　事的時　，市場繁盛　因罵旅客若果往汕頭（或由汕頭往廣州），一定要在這里住息一夜，然後於明早趁車。可惜白大亞灣×人登陸後，公路破壞，市場已難囘復從前的盛况了。</p>
<p>作者最近會在該縣略作勾留，特將當地的風土人情文化敎育　竭向讀者作一個忠實扼要的報吿。雖然報吿中的悲觀成分多於樂觀，而作者仍熱烈希望地方當局和海豐有職之士能够共屬艱鉅向建設的大道邁進！</p>
<p>一，海豐的文化敎育和建設</p>
<p>海豐地方稅款，抽得很重，而文化敎育，和建設事業，却俱出乎一般人的意料之外，海豐縣城祇得一間書局。該書局還取賣故衣，玻璃櫃內滿藏書古文，唐詩，經史的大達圖書，我　買一本『大家唱』歌集，找遍了海丰全縣亦賣不到，由這可見該縣的文化水準是如何的低下了。雜誌固　不用講，即如香港的申報，大公報等報紙，亦沒有零星購買，全縣訂閱香港報紙不滿卅份，全騙　有黨部出版一份民國日報（四開紙的，消息大半是轉載汕頭報和香港報），其餘與文化有關的事業（收音機，電影，公共運動場等），多付缺如。</p>
<p>海申縣的敎育經費，在平時為每年十七萬元，華南戰事發生後減為七萬餘元，現在據說因為稅牧知拙，在二十八年度全縣的預算中，敎育經費祇佔三萬餘元，在這個預算看來，就可以推想海丰全縣的敎育情形了。三萬餘元辦一間初級中學亦不够，且且該三萬餘元，還是全　的敎育經費啊，海丰民衆的敎育怎能普及呢？文盲又　能播除呢？海豐雖然有民衆敎育舘，但亦因限于經費，對于民衆敎育不能有什麽大貢献。再如海丰的小學敎師每月祇支伙食九元，（這還是指縣立小學而言。海豐全縣的小學多少我不大淸楚。）至于區立和鄕立的小學，聞說敎師一個學期，最多只能得五十元，中學的敎師，聞說但是義務的（海豐全縣祇有一間初級中學和一間水產學校）。敎師的待遇如此菲薄，有什麽精神去敎學呢？</p>
<p>海豐有許多　田和荒地，若果有人整理的話，我想每年可增加不少的收入，無奈本地的有產階級，對於這天然的優良環境，任它廢棄。海豐全縣的山頭，光禿禿的佔十分之九·九，爲什麽不推行大規模的造林運動呢？就因樹林太少，所以海　雖然近海，而氣候的冷　，即是央　，風災水災。是沒有一年可以偉　的。</p>
<p>這地民眾很保守　，舖戶的建築最高不上二層。據說一般富戶所以不敢建造洋　的，理由是因爲鑒於陳炯明的洋　變成廢瓦頹垣，就認爲海豐地土，是不適越宜築大洋　的！</p>
<p>我很不情願批評，寥東一帶的地方當築，因爲實在使人失望了。就以海豐的建設來　，修　馬路的聲浪，已鬧了一年多了，可是馬路的水泥固，仍在一日一日的破碎中。在不久以前，第×戰區司令部旅一個姚參議到來海豐視察，曾見有工人在修補屬路，隔了三日姚參　往與寧去了，修補馬路的人亦不見了。</p>
<p>二，海豐的風俗習慣和物產</p>
<p>住在廣州附近的我，驟然奔投到海豐來，覺得有許多事實値得我來報吿。卽如這裏的方言，叫做『學佬話』，有一個字和廣州語完全相的，廣州話稱人美曰『觀』，這地稱人美曰『衰』，廣州朋友初次到海豐要注意這字的用法，以免誤會呀！</p>

<p>【民革社路明航訊】昆明，這個後方的重鎮，由于抗戰以來，全國商業，文化等等都集中在這裏，他便不得不緊密地和有計劃地在担負着維護後方的重資。于是，在五月十三日，昆明市縣空襲緊急救濟聯合募捐辦事處，在省黨部大禮堂開了一個宣傳大會，防空司令官祿介决定在十四，十五兩日分別在城鄕大宣傳。十五日『國際反侵略大會中國分會昆明支會』也開成立大會了。這個抵抗暴×的有力組織在昆明成立，是有極重大的意義的。那天到各團體機關學校及省市縣黨部工作人員八百餘人。先由陣崇仁主席報吿：『反侵略運動大會中國分會昆明支會成立大會，其意義之重大，一方面將×××××××手段宣達於世界，使世界各友邦有所瞭解，進而予我以同情與帮助；一方面×人今日之目的在使吾人遭受重大之犧牲與威脅，而使吾人就範，受其壓迫剝削。但此續果僅足以堅固吾人抗戰之决心，×人毫無效果可言。因此吾人亦將此種種宣諸世界並　告日內瓦總會。爲吾同胞復仇，更予××以制裁。就是反侵略大會的重大意義。」</p>

<p>再經襲廳長演說　，便誦讀致日內瓦總會，及中國分會電文，全場鼓掌通過。我們的「爲正義人道而戰」，「爲維護世界和平而戰」的呼聲，將一定激　國際人士更進一步的制裁國際××侵略者，幷由大會電蔣委員長及前敵將士致敬。</p>
<p>「國際反侵略運動大會中國分會昆明支會，在今日宣吿成立自有偉大的歷史的使命，因爲她是全世界反侵略運動的一環……大家站在一條線上團結一致抵抗×日的侵略……爭取中華民族的自由平等保障世界和平！」這個嚴正的宣語，又在熱烈的掌聲中通過了。</p>

<p>我們在這里要特別認清，目前國際形勢，已經非常利於我們推進這種反侵略運動了。第二，是由於全世界民主國家和廣大愛護民主與和平的人類，均已痛切感受法西斯侵略者的威脅；第二是由於蘇聯和平政策外交與反侵略運動的成功，英法蘇美建立反侵略陣綫運動的進展；第三是中國抗日救國的鬥爭，已經英勇支持了廿二個月以上，而且愈戰愈奮，被全世界公認為反侵略的主力軍，而且同時昭示全世界：橫行一世的法西斯侵略者是可以打倒的！</p>

<p>— J.　V　Kurenberg　王仲鄂</p>
<p>使拜訪非常驚奇的，是德皇的機警與壯盛，他的面容極為動人，當他講起有許多記載德皇的書籍，其實只有少數作者能瞭解他時，當掛着一絲嘲笑，語音中帶有譏諷的抑揚頓挫。</p>
<p>談　有勁而滔滔不絕，無法去阻斷他的。記者想在某次會議中轉到別的話題上——我的機會恰好來了，德皇正在自己動手吃菓醬和麵包——但是他和我笑迎迎地使了一個眼色，又繼續講了下去！他從來不會忘記一個日期或一個人名。</p>
<p>他們談話直言無隱有時雜着俚話，但是講起的只及於自己的時代，從來不曾講過一九一八年十一月以後的事情。</p>
<p>這些就是他的生活情形，是非常　正的生活，從來不想去作投機取巧，或陰謀叛亂等等活動。性格溫和，有老年人的愉悅。常常可以看見他被人干涉，眼光中有老邁的堅實的神情，檢討自己，保住着平和的脾氣。</p>
<p>他以溫暖的愛心，講起忠誠同情於他放逐生活的人們，以及他的友人們。說起英國，那是非常高興的，德皇覺得自己有一半像英國人。他愛好英國鄉親的生活，即以自己的退隱來模倣。但是他覺得在他的心情中常常有抗拒的情懷。</p>
<p>德皇每晨起身的時間是八時至時九，晨餐後在園中散步一會。在村中散步時，他先知照警察，於是他們很謹慎的跟在他後面，其實是不用特別保護的，他同村人都很熱。</p>
<p>伐木已是過去的事情了。他現在歡喜園藝，看護玫瑰花，他常在鄉間駕車出游，或到北海岸去看朋友，喝清茶。而常常是收到不不少少的郵件。</p>
<p>因此在午飯之後，就到書齊中去結束一天的工作。他宴常請杜恩的「工作社團」：他的朋友考古學家們。在一九〇三年買了科夫（Corfn）島後，古物學就成為心愛的癖好了。在二十年的放逐生活中，他已完成了他的「事略，」古物學確已成為最大的愛好。他覺得和科學家在一起是非常愉快的事情，他所宴請的也就是科學家們。</p>
<p>這些就是一個放逐的君王的印像，簡括說來，就是：有老年人快樂的傾向；討論古代文化的興緻很好；在他質樸的杜恩住宅中，有許多欣欣向榮的鮮花。</p>
<h3 id="c29">歐洲能免戰禍乎　上海外僑之見解 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>〔上海通訊〕本埠外僑之大多數、不信歐洲大戰、迫在眉睫、至少有法人一、覺戰爭遲早必成事實、意人一、以為戰事大約將發生之成分、較不致發生之成分為多、惟德人一、相信各問題終可覓得和平之解決、其不信戰爭行將到臨之數人、皆以為希望或可成思想之母、但美人團體敢決美國將不參戰、記者因歐洲危機日見緊急、曾就與歐局最有關係的數國之僑民、探詢彼等之意見、茲彙錄如次、想為關心時局者所樂聞也、</p>
<p>德願與法和平相處</p>
<p>德律師威廉博士曰、余不信戰事即在目前、德國有心向和平之元首在、決不欲訴諸武力、余近曾邀遊歐洲、覺各國中唯德國不談戰事、其他各國人民皆謂德國不鑒信各國報章之與論、其作此言、實極愚昧、要知德國並不如是、德國恒願與其鄰邦生存於和平之中、元首希特勒最近猶特殊聲明、德國願與法國和平相處、德國不因英國報紙盛談戰事而震動、德國不欲得英國任何屬地、余意波蘭問題有獲和平解決之可能、余信波蘭等國必可諒解、若德國該部分為他國之走廊分開、而不予德國以交通之便利、此實不近情理、元首在某次演說中、曾稱、本年九月間之國社黨大會、將名之曰「和平大會」、此節甚堪注意也、</p>
<p>意國情勢今非昔比</p>
<p>中意航業公司意人里希尼曰、歐洲戰禍能望挽回之機會有二、（一）所謂民治陣綫與軸心國相融洽、（二）該陣綫勢力雄厚、足以嚇倒柏林、羅馬、然後者恐難成事害、德、意將為彼等之權利而奮鬥、意國猶未忘上次歐洲大戰後議和時為英、法所給、英法囊括所有、而意國則毫無所獲、飢者將不擇食、必急而得之、今有一事可決者、德意對其今所有者、將永不心饜、意國民眾現日受宣傳之打針、使知意國國力強厚、當局絕少黨及金錢之無多、亦未注重新時代之戰爭、經濟重於武器一節、今日之情勢、當然遠不若一九三五年之惡劣、當時英艦隊駛入地中海、以對付意艦隊、意艦隊之軍火、祇敷作六小時之戰鬥、今則意國海陸軍皆軍火充矣足、</p>
<p>日人感想注視英國</p>
<p>同盟社記者Sbibata曰、余意歐洲戰爭實現與消滅之機會、各佔其半、英國對於戰事、諸多顧忌、其一為歐戰既作、日本將乘機攘奪遠東英人之利益、再、英國因欲維持均勢與現局、及欲決定德、意、日反共同盟究將有何結果、以便發言、故至少目前不致發動、總之、英國現守觀望態度、其大部分之注意、無疑的將在由英為調解人、而成中日和局之可能性、蓋此舉可置日本於大舉參加歐戰之不利地位、英國相信如是則彼能進行建立民治陣綫矣、大局今後微妙、孰敢決定歐戰即將發生工、或不發生乎、蓋任何事件均能牽動均勢也、</p>
<p>法商觀察戰禍不免</p>
<p>經勞世界貿易巴黎某商行之入口經理曰、歐戰在余觀之、實不能免、或發生於最近之將來、或發生於距今若干時、或竟發生於明日、但余敢決終必發生、余意一切談判、不特不足療病、且轉將增重之、唯一之希望、厥在民治陣綫強於柏林、羅馬軸心、恐即如是、亦不能消弭戰禍也、余之巴黎總行來函云、戰事雖不致立即發生、但不可不作未雨綢繆計、故銷謚中國之貨物、立即交貨之定單、法國尙可接受、遠期交貨之定單、則須拒絕、因防戰事發生、港口封鎖、或輪船被沉、貨物被沒收也、自一九一四年夏季以還、歐洲之憂慮戰禍、從無若今日之甚者、蓋上年九月　克危機發生時、余之商行猶接受遠期定意、甘冒危險、而今日則不敢也、此使由歐洲運貨銷滬之商家大受損害、自中國工廠為砲火轟毀滅、入口織品、銷路激增、吾人若能接受遠期定單、則誠大佳事也、</p>
<p>民治國可消弭歐戰</p>
<p>近游歐洲歸滬之某英籍證券經紀人曰、余意民治各國突然轉強其態度、大足消弭歐戰、歐洲今日火藥、散播各地、星星之火、即易使之燎原、但余意希特勒與莫索里尼今皆需用保安火柴、且擬繼續作此戒防、彼等寗願從事談判、而不預昧興我、以作僥倖之圖、萬一失敗必將盡失其今日之所有、余意德國旣與羅馬尼亞訂成協定、因此可獲得收回其舊日殖民地所能得之利益、如油小麥等產品、均可隨意得之、且不必付出行經費、及維持海航之費、歐洲之緊張、固非一時所能寬馳、但余信不致發生戰禍也、</p>
<p>意相智慧不致求戰</p>
<p>美國海軍青年會事務秘書羅斯曰、余個人之見解、歐洲不致發生戰爭、歐洲之政治家今人人皆知戰爭之意義、尤以莫索里尼為最、莫索里尼氏至聰明、至愛國、決不忍使意國淪於破壞也、上次歐戰時、亦曾服務意國青年會中頗久、所得經騐甚巨、余深知莫索里尼氏之為人、但余對於希特勒所知甚寡、然余意希特勒不得莫　里尼之助、必無能為也、莫索里尼善用其智慧、雖其仇者亦為欽佩、余信莫索里尼必知大戰一旦發生、將使之喪失大權、且毀滅其手成之功業、意國之財力、不能從事大戰、意國或有被迫捲入戰爭漩渦之虞、如上次歐戰之奧國然、但余個人不信意國將出此、余信莫索里尼因熟悉經濟及愛護本國、必永無簽字於英、法宣戰書之一日、渠必如當日慕尼黑然、另股覓一出路也、</p>

<h3 id="c32">貝特蘭在文化界歡迎會中演講最近國際形勢 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>民主國家團結在發展中，我們要竭力推動！</p>
<p>雨後的宇宙，淸爽，明朗。離開苦悶的斗室跑到外面逛逛，原本就有這般意態，何况這是一個難得的歡聚，——旣可以會會朋友，又得聽聽不遠千里而來的國際友人的演講。于是乎，堅道。般含道途中，絡繹儘是本港的文化人。</p>
<p>英國曼徹斯特導報名記者貝特蘭先生，奉派冉度來華，道經本港，中國靑年記者學會香港分會特約同文藝協會香港通訊處，在昨天下午四時假座般含道聖約翰宿舍開會歡迎，並請貝氏講「最近國際形勢」。貝特蘭先生是英國的名記者，對于我國抗戰極表同情，曾于去年冬親赴山西前綫巡視，著有「華北前綫」及「中國的新生」等書，昨日赴會參加者，有本港文化界百餘人，眞的是　　畢至，濟濟一堂、許地山先生致詞歡迎之後，年靑而和靄可親的貝特蘭先生遂很生動地開始他的演詞，並由羅吟圃先生繙譯。</p>
<p>貝特蘭先生說在離別香港的一年中，半年是在倫敦，半年是在紐約。這次再來看看在奮鬥中進步的中國，看看諸位親愛的朋友，覺得是非常高興的。在未嘗講入正題之前，他先說明他的立場，並非代表任何一佃國家，興任何一個政府，而是眞眞正正的中國人的朋友。他說在歐美和一般人說到這問題意見大致相同所以，現在所說的話是代表多數外人來說話，接着，他很有層次地掉上本題來了；</p>
<p>國際上有二個可能的政策：第一是『集體安全』；第二是『勢力的均衡』。英美法諸國常在這二者中間搖動。集體安全制度，嘗經一度高唱入雲，終于一九三一年被日本破壞了。繼起而發生的嚴重問題如阿比西尼亞問題。西班牙問題，捷克問題等等的慘劇，無異給『集體安全』一個嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>集體安全的對面就是張伯倫主義——現實主義這是引起的。在保守黨寡頭政治統治之下，　　　　　　　　　　　　張伯倫骨于裏的企圖就是要向德意妥協，進而拉攏法國，成立英法德意的四强同盟，好把蘇聯擠出去。</p>
<p>爲什麽英國人民反對張伯倫，而張伯倫政權一直延續到現在呢？這，就應該從英法的關係研究起。原來，英法二國都有反勢力在互相牽制着；在捷克問題最緊張的時候，　　　　　　德國佔領蘇台德區的，但是要他慢慢地悄悄地不要張揚，　　　　　　　　　是希特勒卻不願等待，急急地張揚起來了。</p>
<p>今天報載英法蘇將成立新協定，如果是事屬眞實的話，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　力　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，將有兩種可能：一是張伯倫政權繼續下去；　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　美國，亦可有能加進英法蘇的這邊來，重新實現『集體安全』了。這，雖然是嫌其太遲，但，還是挽救得及。照此情勢發展下去，無疑地可以增加民主國家帮助中國的力量，深化日本的困難，中國抗戰的最後勝利，就可以提早二年或一年了。</p>
<p>最近英美法對於鼓浪嶼事件之一致行動，亦未嘗不是這種趨勢的象徵。張伯倫之轉變，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。中國方面除希望政府團結之外，還要使人民團結起來擴大反侵略運動。</p>
<p>——一陣熱烈的掌聲，謝謝國際友人的指示。</p>
<p>各位如有什麽問題，可以提出來研討，——許地山先生，希望活潑會場的空氣。喬木先生立刻站立起來；</p>
<p>『　　　　　　　　　　，新的英法蘇協定是不容易實現的』，貝特蘭先生謂：『現在的情勢與從前不同了』『如果新形勢的發展是成功，日本是否加入德意陣線？』貝特蘭先生這樣對思慕先生說：『日本可以有二種可能，一是拆散英美的聯合、一是打蘇聯，這二種，都有困難，都要失敗。』</p>

<p>— 史原</p>
<p>至於這裏人民的戰鬥力亦不差，當莞城和石龍淪陷×人進行第一次掃蕩的時候，大朗墟的民衆在模範壯丁隊的領導之下曾與×人作過壯烈的巷戰，以一百多個武裝的壯丁打擊了來犯的千餘强×，自己雖然死傷了十多位戰士，但×軍的傷亡更數倍於我，裝得一卡車滿滿的運返莞城去。這種光榮的英勇抵抗，使×人感覺到十分的棘手與困難，另方面却大大的提高了民衆的自信心。</p>
<p>可惜因爲得不到有力的指導和帮助，使這龐大的民間武力沒法組織起來，而一些已組織起來的（如模範壯丁隊）亦因經費和種種困難不能支持下去。</p>
<p>更可惜的，這些偉大的民間武力因沒有正當的組織和領導，有時反受土劣流氓的煽惑，用作械鬭撕殺，最近前綫的大沙附近仍有兩姓之間互用機關鎗而進行殘酷械　的痛心事件發生。</p>
<p>（四）埋洃苦幹的靑年戰士　環境雖然惡劣和困難，但這裏的救亡工作並不會因此而停頓，仍有許在熱誠的靑年男女散在各鄕艱苦地支持，他們始終不放棄自己的戰鬥崗位，到香港或其他安全的地方去做難民，更有的因爲反對父兄做順民的無恥，而堅决地和家庭斷絕關係，他們的雄心不但戰勝×人漢奸的壓迫和欺騙，而且戰勝了饑餓與疾病的襲擊。</p>
<p>最近他們更從個別作戰的狀態中轉變過來，在軍政當局的帮助之下建立了統一的『東莞民衆救亡工作』。這個在艱苦奮鬥中長大起來的新陣容，必將掀起東莞的抗戰巨浪而把×人的新陰謀粉碎。</p>
<p>然而我們不能隱諱，在東江的南戰場上仍潛伏着許多嚴重的危機和弱點，它使我們蒙受了不少的損失和困難，並錯過了許多有利的時機。</p>
<p>（一）×人的懷柔政策　日×自第一期作戰受了嚴重的打擊之後，便改用所謂「懷柔」政策，這個政策在莞城和石龍的表現是一，暫時放　屠殺政策，二，把大量劣貨向民衆廉價推銷，三，利用漢奸施行奴化敎育和欺騙定傳，四，設立兌換處，日本軍用票可以隨時換回中國國幣。因此有許多落後民衆受其愚惑甘作順民。</p>
<p>（二）漢奸傀儡的活動數月來莞城和石龍的×人在表面上似乎非常沈寂沒有什麼積極的行動，但實際上它們的陰謀，是此過去更來得的毒辣，它們軍事上雖然是採取守勢，在政治上却是積極的進攻，盡量收買和訓練漢奸，及鞏固僞政權的組織。並多方面向×區附近的人民恫嚇，威迫他們要建立偽維持會的組織，企圖這樣來逐步縮小我游擊隊的活動範圍，以至消滅我們的游擊根據。</p>
<p>（三）軍民關係的惡化　說到軍官本身亦有許多嚴重的弱點，中下級軍隊的戰鬥情緖不够堅强，嫖賭的風氣比過去更盛，一部分新編的游擊隊更加腐化：打票，勒索，搶刦，包私形同土匪（其實有小部份原來就是土匪以致民間怨聲載道，甚至說比日本兵還要慘呀』，這雖是一小部份的腐敗行爲，但因爲他們是掛着游擊隊的招牌　一般頭腦簡單的民衆便對整個部隊也發生極惡的印象。給×人和漢奸一個很好的挑撥機會。</p>
<p>（四）行政機構軟弱　在這個游擊區裏而雖然我們仍保有廣大的行政領域，但因爲環境困難和×人漢奸的恫嚇，許多鄕保甲長，都不敢認眞負責做事，並表示要辭職，譬如政府的許多重要法令都無法傳達到下層去執行，形成了無政府狀態，這亦是漢好活動較爲容易的原因之一。</p>
<p>（五）友軍關係不密切因爲這裏的部隊有許多是從外處調來的，且有二部是初組織的新軍，因此在敎育和戰鬥能力上因有强弱之分，而軍紀亦有好壞之別，正爲此，大家日常的關係便存着好些隔膜，並有意無意地互相輕視，這種現象在作戰時往往影響了切實合作的精神。</p>
<p>整個抗戰的局勢已走上更有利的階段，×人因爲國內反戰運動的日益擴大，我游擊隊的普遍發展，其速戰速决的陰謀將更加積極。它們鞏固後方的計劃，與進攻西南和西北的企圖是同時並進的。因此，我們切勿看到東莞石龍的×人暫採守勢，就忘記了它們打通廣九路的陰謀。</p>
<p>東江南岸的兄弟姊妹們，僑外的東寳同胞們，大家緊急地動員來協助政府軍隊，爲克服上面這些弱點，爲支持東江南岸的抗戰，爲粉碎×人打通廣九路的陰謀，而支持一切的力量吧！</p>

<h3 id="c56">世界博覽會電影展覽　例如「運輸和交通」項目　分為政治教育商業等類 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>四月三十日開幕的紐約世界博覽會中、電影也是佔據着相當軍要的地位的、但在大會所展覽的十四項目中、它並不獨立、也不屬於『娛樂』或『藝術』這兩個項目、而是列入了『運輸和交通』內、爲什麽要把電影列入『運輸和交通』呢？這是經過大會當局議决後才定的辨法、因爲他們認爲電影能傳遞消息、把世界各國的風物新聞、介紹給觀衆們、對於運輸和交通方面、其貢獻是重大於『娛樂』或『藝術』的。</p>
<p>這次的電影展覽是完全免費參觀的、因性質而又分爲政治、敎育和商業三類、</p>
<p>屬於政治一類的影片、當然要推西席地密爾導演的『進展中的美國』、此外、英國用電影聯合會的名義參如了幾部記錄片、法國則以旅行短片最多、蘇聯也有幾部技術和故事並美的長片加入、至於小國中、比利時的工業和風景短片（共二十一部）是最値得一看的、</p>
<p>敎育影片方面、米高梅、派拉蒙、雷電華、二十世紀福斯、華納、環球等影片公司都有出品參加、而美國各州也有叙述本州的風景產物、文化、習慣……等影片、共四十八部、</p>
<p>商業電影方面、著名世界的美國麥費登出版公司的一部短片、最使人注意、這部短片只有四卷長、但却化了五萬美金的巨資、童星馬滋孿生兄弟在該片中任要角、故事是叙述一家公司頓廣吿力量、使事業日趨繁榮、當然、這影片的目的、原是要招攬各地商店公司在這公司出版的刊物上登廣吿、</p>
<p>卡通片也有兩部、一部是華德狄斯耐為國家餅乾公司而攝製的『米老鼠大集會』、另一部是美國煤油業攝製的橡皮傀儡影片、描寫煤油對於人類生活的重要、因爲演出者是用有伸縮性的橡皮人、爲電影藝術闢了一條新路、所以從創作上的價値而言、這部卡通片是勝過了『米老鼠大集會』</p>
<p>博覽會中還設者一個影片評選會、把展覽的影片、分門別類加以批評、優勝者給予獎牌和獎狀、</p>

<p>（一）醫生的困難（The　Doctors　Dilemma）本劇紀的是美國革命故事、仍由温黛希拉任女主角、按温黛希拉飾演費花女。乃蕭伯納親自推薦的、現在已與巴氏簽訂五年合同、在銀壇上的堆位自然將漸漸高升、男主角屬於鼎鼎大名的克拉克蓋博、</p>
<p>（二）魔鬼的門徒（TheDevil＇s　Disciple）巴氏早就想拍這一部劇本了、但蕭氏以爲本劇太激烈、或者將受人反對、所以才先拍『賣花女』的、現已定在『醫生的困難』後攝製、</p>
<p>（三）凱撒和克麗奧派屆拉（Caesar　And　Celpatra）本劇是羅馬時代的一段羅曼史、西席地密爾曾根據這件故事拍過一部『傾國傾城』、當然在蕭的劇本中、還有他自已的觀點</p>

<p>詹姆士賈克奈『一身是瞻』爲當然的代表作。</p>
<p>洛勒蒙高茂萊　洛勒年來作品甚少。允以數年前與茂娜洛埃合演之『石榴裙熱』爲最出色。</p>
<p>保羅茂尼　保羅演戲。可謂無片不隹。『左拉傳』被當選爲去年十大巨片之一。惜不能在滬公映。　以『傷面人』『亡命者』「萬古流芳」「莽漢懺情」諸片比較。允以「萬古流芳』一片最爲卓越精湛。</p>

<p>希金不知道怎樣囘答。因爲，不滿二十呎遠，卡伯帝在和愛利莎談話。他心裏很討厭那人，但是毫無辦法可想，一時脫不開身，等到脫身時，卡伯帝向他走來，帶着得意。</p>
<p>『密司杜麗特兒很是幽默，』他說了便走向一羣新聞記者面前去。</p>
<p>一個女記者問、「唉、密司脫卡伯帝，那位密司杜麗特兒是誰？」</p>
<p>「我已知道她的一切，她是——」他停止談話，低頭俯在女記者的耳上，輕聲地說：「我想，她不過是個貧民區的女子」。</p>
<p>『你瘋了嗎！』卡伯帝嘲笑的說，『我——阿力司鐵卡伯帝、你最好的學生，知道她一定是位公主！」</p>

<p>息影多時之劉松生、昨日披甲上陣、在上半時充當右內鋒、脚法如舊、盤運亦矯捷、下半時任右前衛、氣力稍差、張金海守前線時、技術平平、未露頭角、但以松生易位後、竟能連建兩功、甚見活躍、羅斗文祖任左翼、甚爲努力、好盤及貪功兩種弊病、一一捐除、傳球亦算及格、梁柏偉表演頗隹、位置亦好、譚振輝氣力充足、但經騐似尙欠缺、其餘諸將、皆能演出彼等之原有水準、中鋒之陳德輝亦覺出角、</p>
<p>洋水兵守勝于攻、老漢巴谷門路純熟、進退得宜、技不在的臣之下、兩內衛亦甚可人、上半時力阻南華前鋒、使彼等無射門機會、僅以〇比一先負、下半時十五分鐘許、馬田息抽筋離場、不能再賽、南華前鋒連進數球、造成六比〇之絕大比數、戰情如后、</p>
<p>兩軍接觸後、德輝、北華、松生分兵推進、堪士、馬田、加利亞、谷巴、丹利士打分頭迎戰、</p>
<p>五分鐘、水益傍襲、忌利打路擋出界外、南華開得角球、無所建樹、八分鐘、水益邊睡發難、德輝同時突入、猛射攻鬥、忌利打路勇撲出外、水益再望門發炮、堪士衛來抵拒、球落荒而去</p>
<p>十分鐘北華水益聲東擊西、德輝越入陣地、猛施射門、球疾如矢、忌利打路挽救無及、一比零南華先勝、</p>
<p>十二分鐘、德輝捲土重來、馬田飛身力拒、德煇掃射攻門、球中門柱、反彈而出、馬田力救得免、同時麥尼路衣云士、菲路士揮軍進犯、終無所逞、</p>
<p>十九分鐘、德輝遠送球斗文、卽乘虛突入、逼近門前、發足掃射、竟中忌利打路之足、</p>
<p>廿一分鐘、斗文越過馬田、水益同時侵入、勁射攻門、忌利打路挽救迅速、渡渦危關、巳而水益逼得角球、落點適中、忌利打路拒出門外、斗文趕來發射、竟中鬥柱、如入寳山、空手而回、上半場水兵以〇比一見敗</p>
<p>易地交鋒、南華改調松生退守中關、金海調充前綫、軍容更盛、五分鐘、水兵冀圖收復失地、森馬士傍吊攻門、榮才援救得力化險爲夷、</p>
<p>十分鐘、水兵五路齊下、頻向南華陣地園攻、衣云士突施冷矢、榮才勇救出關水兵懊喪而退、</p>
<p>十五分鐘、斗文德輝衝入水兵陣地、堪士出迎、德輝脚頭起處、二比〇再捷、</p>
<p>十八分鐘、德輝興兵、北華策應趕來、谷巴、馬田力拒無效、北華卽掃射入網、三比〇、</p>
<p>廿分鐘、北華捲土重來</p>
<p>金海奮身直入、再陷一城、四比〇、</p>
<p>廿二分鐘、斗文傍傳、金海即向門發射、球中門柱、惟南華銳氣正盛、松生截交北華、再傳德輝、果不辱命、又建一功、五比〇、</p>
<p>廿八分鐘、慶才遠送一程、金海鬥前迎頂、球卽進入網內、六比〇、此時水兵雖竭力相持、終以大勢已去、無能爲力、鳴金收軍時、水兵以〇比六慘敗、陣勢如下、</p>

<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>墊上運動、在我國的歷史還很短、在這短促的期間、要使全國都普遍採作體育訓練材料、當然不是容易的事、不過這種運動、有它獨特的價値、尤其在全面抗戰、體育須與軍事配合的今日、格外顯出它的重要、先讓我先來談一談它的價値、和實施應注意的事項：</p>
<p>墊上運動的動作、如：旋轉、滾翻、倒立、顚仆等、能養成顚盪迴旋的習慣、適應航空技術的需要、機巧敏捷、生動活潑、能養成隨機應變的技術、適應白刃相接的環境、它是眞正的全身運動、一跳一躍、一滾一翻之間、對於內臟的刺激、軀幹的鍛鍊、格外有益、能培養元氣、適應持久抗戰最後的堅持、它不需多大的設備、除了幾張墊子而外、別無他求、能省經濟、爲抗戰樽節財力、這都是它直接有助於抗戰的、至於它動作的活潑　於健身衛國而外、還能發展練習者活潑的天性、尤其餘事、</p>
<p>墊子的製法、最講究的、是用棉胎兩面舖棕　皮做裏、用翻布做面、面上縱橫隔尺許的地方、須縫牢、以免棉胎和棕　皮會縮做一團、馬虎一點、可以編稻草爲墊、面上蒙起蔴袋和蓆子、節可以、因陋就簡的話、就是編草爲塾、或在平整的地上、也都可以做、</p>
<p>墊子的保管　也是很重要的問題　最緊要是不可淋着雨水　致下次無法應用　用後必須把塵埃拭凈、放置高處、免染汚穢、運動時有碍衛生、</p>
<p>在實施墊上運動之前　必須先做一些準備運動　使身體發暖　最好的準備遝動、就是跳的動作、做時可以令練習者繞墊子的一面跑成一個圈子　跑到墊子的時候、就依次做幾種跳的動作</p>
<p>墊上運動、是一種機巧和美和的運動、不是用蠻力硬幹的運動、所以做動作必須按照一定的方法；同時它需要胆大而兼心細、所以做動作不能粗野草率、倘是違背了這兩個原則、往往容易發生危險的。</p>
<p>墊上運動的動作、有一個人做的、有聯合多人做的、難易深淺、分得很淸楚、任何人都可以按步就班的學習、不過它高深艱難的動作、需要相當的練習工夫　這襄先介紹一些初步的動作、掛一漏萬、在所不免　還請指正、</p>
<p>在沒有談動作之前　筆者有一個小小的聲明　希望閱者要注意　就是下列的動作、有分類的性質　但不是嚴格的分類、動作的難易、、不是順着總次序的　每一類中都有難易之分　一個動作有幾種做法、而方法相同或這一類動作與別一類動作的方法相同時、就祗在說明下註明、不逐一的舉出來了、墊上運動多數都可以連續做的、雖沒有每個都註明、習者是不可不知道的、</p>

<h3 id="c73">所謂「華與商業銀行」及其任用 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 寒暉</p>
<p>南京「維新政府」和日商銀行合設的所謂「華興商業銀行、在天津「聯銀券」市價慘跌中在上海創立了、據該行「總裁」陳錦濤和興亞院聯絡部津田表示、「該行資本五千萬圓、日僞各半將發行與法幣同價的「華興券」、「常能自由兌換外負」　津田並有「日本僑民將首先使用其銀行券」之語、好些人以爲北方「聯銀」券價格慘落、欲代替法幣的作用、已歸失敗、今日還想在上海及江南推行「華興」券、殊爲不解、其實、這個問題、决非如一般人想像中那麽簡單、値得仔細准究、</p>
<p>帝國主義經濟侵略的發展過程、是由商品輪出進入資本輸出、然而資本輸出時代、並不停止商品輸出、而更須擴大其商　輸出　以增加其資本的累積、資本輸出的目的、是操縱殖民地的金融和產業、——尤其是操縱殖民地的貨轄制度、所謂美元集團、英鎊集團、卽是資本輸出最成功的表現、日本因重工業原料缺乏、產業基礎建築於輕工業、國際牧支的平衡、全賴輕工業、甚至農村半製品（如絲　）的輸出、甚於輸出的資本、除東三省較有成績、此外就不能和英美法各國競爭、且其輕工業主要涼料如羊毛棉花、仍須仰　於國外、「九一八」後、侵奪了我國東四省、固然解决了它重工業原料的缺乏、而輕工業主要原料的貧乏、仍未解决、爲了解决這種困難、故有內蒙及華北特殊化、和所謂日「滿」支聯合的日元集團運動、可是日本經營東四省、已竭其資本的大部分、實無餘力實現這種陰謀、又因中央法幣政策的成功、和華北當局的堅毅支持、所謂中日經濟提携、日元集團的計劃、全部失敗、日軍領佔華北以後、就由『北平臨時政府』創立的「聯合準備銀行」發行「聯銀」券、其計劃是根本消滅法幣、而爲北方唯一的通貨、實現牠日元集團的陰謀、可是、事實上、華北的法幣勢力、决不如奉票一般的脆弱、所以「聯銀」券在日軍的　　下推行逾年　仍祗限於若干日軍城市據點以內、並未成爲北方唯一的通貨、其失敗原因很多、大致說來、</p>
<p>（一）因日本長期侵華戰爭的結果、公債濫發、通貨膨脹、日元的價格動搖、興日元聯繫的「聯銀」券、其價格自難免暴落、</p>
<p>（二）法幣準備充足　最近外匯平衡準備金成立、上海的「黑市」、亦相當穩定、人民一致信仰、</p>
<p>（三）日僞統治勢力、尙侷促於若干城市據點、大部土地仍在中央政府統治之下、</p>
<p>（四）天津租界區的白銀、刼奪不成、英美法各外商銀行一致拒絕「聯銀」券</p>
<p>（五）聯銀券並無準備、發行數額甚鉅、以致物價高漲、券價慘跌、（僞券之天津市價貸跌至僅値法幣六角左右、</p>
<p>至（六）最近中央軍事上反攻的勝利、</p>
<p>因此、「聯銀」券祇在日軍佔領的北方都市中　强通行、而一入農村、便爲法幣的世界、絕無「聯銀」券通行的餘地、日本發行「聯銀」券、以代替法幣的陰謀、在北方可說已吿失敗、但因利用「聯銀」統制外匯、限制進出口貿易、促進日本商品的推銷、却已有相當成效　觀於本年度第一季日貨進口激增、歐美各國貨物輸入激减、可爲證明、</p>
<p>在日軍於前年的初佔領上海及江南時、强迫使用若干軍用票、其原意、以爲此等軍用票、一經使用於佔領區、祗　花了一些印刷費、卽可無償的換到鉅額的農產品、以充其輕工業的原料以及食糧、以挽救其將崩　的經濟機構。</p>

<p>國外經濟狀況</p>
<p>至國外經濟狀况　在外交緊張　軍備競爭之局面下　亦以不景氣現象爲較普遍、就英國而言　本年度始終在不景氣之過程中、依據倫敦經濟　雜誌畫業活動指數、自去年十二月之一一一　〇（一九三五爲一〇〇）絡續下跌、至本年度十二月爲一〇〇·五、縮减百分之十左右、物價亦見下降、而失業人工、則有增加　推其原因、最初感受美國物價及股票市場暴落之影響　繼則對外留易、因世界政治之不安　日見不振、以　形成國際收支之惡化、英鎊地位　殊感虛軟　九月間因捷克問題、外　交危急、英美匯率、絡續下降　達四元六角餘、美國方面、本年度上半期經濟狀况　承上年度秋季股票市塲風潮之後、依然不見振作　惟至五月以後　羅斯福總統再度膨脹預算、支出餌額救濟費用、因市場籌碼之增加、各業漸見活動、股票及商品價格、又趨上游、同時大宗商品存底、自去歲减產以來、頗見减少、而國內外備戰益亟、需要軍實至殷、工業生產、遂受刺激、出口貿易、亦略能維持上年度之水準一切情狀、較英國爲佳、法國方面因法郎跌價物價絡續上漲、但生產指數、至年底始稍增加　而失業人數、迄未减退、且因擴充軍備、預算不敷日鉅、本年度底遂有新財政經濟計畫之實施、延長勞工工作時間、以增生產、减省政府支出、改良稅收、以求預算之平衡、强健政府之金　組織、以引資金之復歸、各項經濟狀况、正在調整之過程中、至德、意、日俄等國、在統制經濟之下、以備戰爲惟一目的、推行種種計劃、以求經濟之自足、人民生活之改善與否、已非當前之要圖、總觀各國經濟狀况、雖不如我國之直接感受戰事　擊、而因　戰及應戰事關係、　已失其止常發展、無不犧牲一切、以求軍力之充實、今後世界和平希望、殆已不絕如縷、此則吾人於觀察國內外環境之餘、不能不抱有無遺　者也（完）</p>

<p>— 朱里</p>
<p>沒有了家鄕，家裏來的信也不再像以前那麽絮刮的了，而且從來未曾提起一句家事以外的話：地方是怎樣失去的，失去了，又怎樣地醞釀着另外一種『組織』，怎樣地被統治着。</p>
<p>然而我却完全明白了這緘默的原因。能够從撿查員的手上滑到郵袋裏去的信件，用曠棄已久的毛筆寫着歪斜的字，信上說着的話也就老是那　些了，地方上不能有新的恐怖，新的威脅和數說不淸的新的捐稅，同時，也不能不有仇恨的生長，反抗，到處發生着狙擊案，和揭竿而起的游擊戰鬥。以征服者的姿態出現　的軍隊卽不能不一面施賄賂，一而加以壓　，一個過去曾憑着幾十支土匪時代的舊毛瑟駁殼槍橫行一時的鄕紳現在居然是顯赫的統治階級或以猙獰的面目代表着統治階級；而一個和平的村莊會因爲位居在游擊隊退却的路綫上，或完全不需要任何原因，被焚毀了，成爲廢墟。</p>
<p>這些是預期着的災殃。但是每看完了家裏來的信，我茫然若失了，我所得到的全不是我所預備着的。這是可相信的嗎，故鄉的一切仍舊，殘殺停止了，而且可以像從前那麽平靜地安居着，這又是可以相信的嗎，地方安靜，人們重新在征服者的統治下安排着生活和事業，沒有仇恨，也沒有游擊戰爭？</p>
<p>不會是這樣的，過去，我們是習慣了，我們受着自己的軍隊保護，我們熟習着每一種捐稅的名目，也熟習着每一個徵牧捐稅的人，他們來了，把錢交出去，收據，那是多麽不信任人家的憑證，覺得沒有需要，推辭着不領，卽使是塞到手裏來了，也幷沒有重視，隨手塞到要是找都找不到的角落裏去。</p>
<p>現在提着錢袋來敲門的人却不再是熟稔的了，從來沒有聽見過的捐稅要那惡狼的嘴裏聽見了，聽見了便得交出同樣數目的錢，不容許說一句想說的話，這已經是鬼魅的世界，人有人情理，可是這情理已不復存在，勿庸申說，也申說不通。</p>
<p>從前，我們出門，沒有一點顧忌，走遠路，天夜了。趕下囘家，便去敲人家的門，或投宿在途中的廟宇裏。現在就是一個行商也要被關在家裏，那不必在夜間，白天跨出自己的家門，一支白色的刺刀便會截住了去路，「通行證，」這是自己的土地，自己砌起來的道路，但是道路上已站着黃色的障礙物，執着尖槍，把槍尖上的刺刀截住了人們的去路。</p>
<p>就是終日把自己關在家裏的人，事實上也無法過着安靜的日子，不是沒有那樣的事，平白地有人破門而入，洗刦了住家又撕拆了女人。爲什麽？連自己的家鬥都不能隨自己的意思打開或關閉了，一個安靜的家庭也會受到干涉的。不只是戶外，每個隘路上站着黃色的障礙物，而是黃色的障礙物盤據在每一隻角落上。他們可以隨時破門而入，洗劫了住家又撕折了女人，這是爲什麽？就是爲了搜查「良民證？」</p>
<p>應該還有着數說不淸的災殃，而這些悲慘的遭遇是無論什麽時候都可能發生在人們的身上的。過去曾爲着享受生活而賡續着生命，現在！生活裏有了無期盡的痛苦，生命卽是那麼脆弱，那麽悲慘地蒙上了永久的恥辱。</p>
<p>儘管相信着這恥辱是可以用血洗去的，沒有了家鄕已經是整整一年的事了，起初我是那麽焦慮看，盼望一點家理來的消思，可是消息那麽地斷絕着。後來，終于像其他的地方一樣，信件又通行了，我殷切地折開着每一封家理來的信，但是我所得到的全不是我所預期着的。我芒然若失了，</p>
<p>我突然從迷茫中想起來，同樣一把剪刀是可以剪去戰區游華的活躍和「征服者」寄到在海那邊的家裏去的鄉愁的消息的。</p>
<h3 id="c79">苦悶——在香港 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 何歷江</p>
<p>這塊抗戰後的樂土。在我却目之爲沙漠。我在這沙漠上，感到的是：寂寞，單調，精神的飢渴，心靈的苦悶，遭遇的悲哀，前途的黯淡；然而，我的意志是鐵般的，我們當然不是悲觀主義義者。</p>
<p>我的苦悶，相信很多靑年都感到苦悶，因爲這裏實在沒有什麽工作可撇。環境的不良，社會的黑暗，人情的好僞，如果沒有學熱了吹牛拍馬的手段，想混一點事情做，是很難很難的事，眞似難於上靑天。</p>
<p>洋場的堆方雖然爲一大部份人所喜歡，感到快樂，感到興趣，享樂主義者，在銷金窩裏，金迷紙醉，酒綠燈紅，戲院舞廳，導遊社，酒家等，式式皆有，不患缺少陶醉的地方。當然，這些興奮劑，麻醉藥，他們自然合口味</p>
<p>引　，欺詐，鑄束，不自由，沒有工作可做，沒有與趣的生活，也缺乏了有童義的正當娛樂，所以，精神的飢渴，和心震的苦悶，這是許多靑年所感受到的。</p>
<p>金光，洋氣，籠罩着這塊地方，許多人們的頭腦昏亂了，神經麻醉了，目光迷眩了，忘却了原來，也忘却了爲什麽會　開美麗的故鄕，來到這裏，而這裏是什麼旗下？什麽政治？甚麽地方？爲甚麽原因會如此？，更滿不在乎。力其高等的羣，更會弄得人瞪目結舌。</p>
<p>總之，，就生活方面說：米珠薪桂，寸金尺土，許多衣料及廳用東西，除某種劣貨外，物價指數甚高，資本家業主，大肆發國難財。我在香港，只有感到無數的悲哀和苦悶而已。</p>

<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>一，我有一根槍了</p>
<p>我有一根槍了，而且是七九式的長槍。</p>
<p>我忍不住驕傲起來了……</p>
<p>我周身的血液也因此沸騰起來，激烈地在震盪着，</p>
<p>我彷彿要忍不住了，</p>
<p>我想開槍，</p>
<p>豁——啦，</p>
<p>我攀開槍機，裝了了一排子彈。</p>
<p>然後，我把自已比擬做一個真正的戰士了</p>
<p>於是，當若黑夜，我悄悄地獨自的遺留在平原裏，在</p>
<p>剛揷下秧的水田岸上，</p>
<p>我還爬上了土岡，</p>
<p>也攀登上了巍峨的山嶺：</p>
<p>在那裏，我握着槍極目從視地面，</p>
<p>朝着那些山山，水水和碧綠的田野，我忍不住輕笑起來了，</p>
<p>我這麽輕輕自語着：我正是祖國的守護者呵！</p>
<p>二，一場激烈的戰鬥等待着我</p>
<p>一場激烈的戰鬥等待着我了，</p>
<p>但我一點也沒有着慌，</p>
<p>我反而更加鎮定，更加鼓舞，</p>
<p>我開始把一切繫念都割斷了，</p>
<p>我只用一顆憤怒的心呼喚着自己，</p>
<p>於是，我的血液反而更加沸騰了，</p>
<p>我迫切地渴待着戰鬥的來到，</p>
<p>我不能再稍爲忍耐了，</p>
<p>我要戰鬥，</p>
<p>我要殲滅我的敵人，</p>
<p>我知道得淸淸楚楚：祖國要在戰鬥中生長</p>
<p>我抓緊了鎗，吳奮得有點狂了，</p>
<p>祖國，祖國的自由與光明呵！</p>
<p>三，我珍愛着鎗彈</p>
<p>接過了沉重的鎗彈的時候，我興奮得戰慄起來了，</p>
<p>我輕輕地撫摩着它們，</p>
<p>我　視着它們那在太陽下面反射的光亮，</p>
<p>我是珍惜它們的</p>
<p>我把它們仔細地點數着：</p>
<p>一二三四五……</p>
<p>我數了一遍又一遍，</p>
<p>我的希望落在　一顆子彈的上面，</p>
<p>我要每顆子彈射擊出去開出了我的希望之花，</p>
<p>我要一顆子彈換得了一個×人的生命，</p>

<h3 id="c81">新階段的文藝批評 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>在今日中國整個的文藝運動中，創作實踐之趕不上客觀的抗戰現實，乃是一件非常明顯的事，然而事情還有比這更爲嚴重的，那就是批評實踐之大大的落後，自從抗戰開展以至於目前，二十幾個月來的鬥爭已經在我們民族的內部引起了無限的發展變動，使中國的現實大大地改換了它的形貌，然而我們的文藝底批評實踐和理論活動，不僅趕不上那時時刻刻處在激越的轉變中的現實，而是連那本來已經落在現實後面的創作實踐也無法追上，它的這種不可諱言的落後，無疑地是今日中國文藝運動的損失，中國民族解放的文化鬥爭的損失。</p>
<p>文藝的理論活動和批評實踐，是應該時時刻刻站在創作活動的前頭，給予創作活動以不斷的指導　檢討和策勵的　尤其在今日根基還是非常脆弱的中國新興文藝運動之中　創作活動之需要理論和批評的培育，正如同一個嬰孩之需要乳汁和一株嫩草之需要露水一樣，必需有健全的理論活動與批評實踐的指引與扶掖，它才能夠獲得迅速的正常發展，而今日中國中文藝運動上的理論批評之落後，就使得創作活動失去了它所需要的乳汁與露水，失去了它的指導的中心，這種營養資料的缺乏，是中國文藝運動之始終不能脫出稚弱的貧乏的階段，不能大踏步地伴隨着現實作每一個細微曲折的階段的發展底最主要的原因。</p>
<p>理論與批評上的這種嚴重的落後，是必需予以迅速的克服的，爲着我們文藝運動的發展，爲着文藝上抗日任務之完密的達成，許多時候以前人們的目光使注視到了文藝理論與批評活動之强化，可是直到今日，抗戰已經愈益深入地轉進了它的新階段，已經給當前的文藝運動帶來了許多更新而且也更嚴重更迫切的任務，而我們的文藝理論與批評，却仍舊未能得到眞正豫期的强化或發展，這顯然是一個重大的缺陷，如果我們今日運不趕速的來進行這一方面補强工作，那麽明天的同時也是今天的文藝運動，將不能不大大地失色，大大地脫節於今日激烈的民旗解放現實，因爲現實是進展的，我們的理論與批評必需隨時隨地　活地站在現實底每一個發展環節的前頭，啟示給文藝創作以新的適應於每一個現實環節的道路，引導它的發展，批判它的工作，同時强化它的鬥爭，這樣地才能使文藝運動跟抗戰的現實發生緊密的聯系，互相交流，互相形響，從而使它所有担的任務獲得完全的達成，反之，如理論果與批評不能發揮其領導的批判任的務，則文藝運動之與抗戰現實脫節是所在難免的，無論是今天或是明天。</p>
<p>文藝運動上的理論與批評實踐的强化與深化，今日無疑地是交到了全中國的文藝工作者手上來，這是我們中國又藝工作奢在抗戰新階段上底最偉大而且最迫要的工作之一，我們不能忽視這一項工作，也正猶同我們不能忽視戰們　行動上的戰鬥一樣，今天，我們有新的必要迫使我們向我們過去的文藝批評理論活動採取全設的批判討檢，針對着我們當前客觀的抗戰情緖，同時適應着我們民族底偉大的歷史傳統，建設我們適應於新形勢興新階段的新的理論，新的批評；提高我們文藝運動的理論認識，深化一般文藝工作者對於現階段中國歷史的本質和轉點以及新階段現實形勢的中心與傾向底理解，根　我們的民族革命運動，根據我們民族的特點，根據今日處在苦鬥中的中國大衆底生活與習慣的內容，去建設純粹現實化中國化的文藝創作與批評的基本方法，奠立中國文藝理論底完整的體系——這就是我們今天底最偉大的工作，最有意義的工作。</p>
<p>在抗戰的新階段上愈益嚴重化了和深化了的現實戰鬥，是向文藝要求着更高度的敏銳性與機動性來反映以及促進現實的鬥爭，因此，新階段的文藝批評，首先就需要在每一個現實戰鬥的進行中或是發展中，提出新的創作的中心，指出當前的文藝反映所需要循依的標準的道路，把引導文藝的鬥爭與現實的鬥爭相聯系相配合的工作，當成自己的基本的任務，所以我們今日的批評實踐和理論的活動，必需以高度的敏感去完成它的使命，正猶同蘇聯著名的文藝理論家倍斯巴洛夫（I．Bespalov）所說的一樣，它必需「一面作時代的總計，一面由樣式與風格去檢討文學的習慣，只有這樣，才不單能够給與評價文學的可能性，還能給與把新的課題提出於文學之前的可能性。」</p>
<p>新階段對於理論與批評所提出的要求，不祗是不斷地在每一發展與躍進的前頭給文藝創作提出新的課題，並扶被其完成這種新的課題底工作，而且，它更向理論與批評要求其本身的深化，因爲倘使理論與批評的本身不能獲得深化，那麽它就不能有力地去領導文藝的創作與文藝的鬥爭，所以它必需加緊其自身的鍊鍛工作，積欐去研究對於現實之新的美的關係，發掘新的美的理想和大衆化的正在形成着的文藝批評的新形式，從事於具體地表現着我們今日的現實對藝術的要求底新的美學之創造。</p>
<p>文藝工作者羣是一個偉大的敎育人羣，他們需要敎育今日的中國大衆生活，去鬥爭，但是，他們的本身也需要受敎育，他們需要從文藝的理論活動與批評實踐的中間獲得敎育，因而，處在戰新階段的今日，我需要加深這種敎育敎育者的工作。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Influence of the Anglo-Soviet-French Military Alliance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>According to a London dispatch yesterday, the British government has officially confirmed that the United Kingdom has agreed to form a defensive military alliance with the Soviet Union; it is also rumored that France will be a member of the alliance, and Turkey is also in a position to join. In this way, the establishment of the volatile European anti-aggression front can be considered clear, and the foundation of the anti-aggression front has been completely consolidated from here. Therefore, the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance is of great significance. Its impact will also be very broad, not only limited to Europe, but also extending to the Far East.</p>
<p>According to British sources, the Soviet Union will most likely join the alliance under two conditions: first, to determine common measures for the three countries on the basis of mutual action, which means that if any one of the three countries is subjected to aggression, the other two countries should immediately come to their aid; second, with regard to guaranteeing the issues of other countries, the three countries will agree that if any other country is invaded, and has indeed tried its best to resist the aggression, and has appealed for assistance, the three countries should devote all their efforts to assist the invaded country. Judging from this content alone, the Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance will have at least the following impacts:</p>
<p>First, the European anti-aggression front will be soundly established on the basis of this Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance, and other small and weak countries will compete to join this alliance, or be affiliated to this alliance group, because they will have sufficient and reliable guarantees from now on. Previously, small countries in Eastern Europe, and even some small and weak countries in Northern and Eastern Europe, hesitated because the UK's past guarantees were not very reliable, and coupled with the enticement of Germany and Italy, there was a possibility of defecting to the aggressors. However, if the Soviet Union's conditions are adopted now, the guarantee can be sufficient, and they will naturally be willing to leave the tiger's den and enter a comfortable home.</p>
<p>Second, the Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance will greatly affect the Far East, meaning that our emphasis that the anti-aggression front must include the Far East will also develop from here. Our argument is that the alliance will stipulate that if any one of the three countries is subjected to aggression, the other two countries should immediately come to their aid, and the UK, Soviet Union, and France all have the possibility of being invaded by Eastern aggressors in the Far East. Therefore, the world's anti-aggression front cannot be limited to Europe alone. Here, because there are also many small and weak countries in the Far East that hope to be guaranteed by strong countries, and the United States' advocacy is the strongest, the United States will also very naturally join the anti-aggression front sooner or later, which will be further strengthened.</p>
<p>Third, the alliance groups, that is, the aggression group and the anti-aggression group, will be more centralized, and their opposing situation will be clearer, forming the opposing situation of the alliance before the First World War. The German-Italian military alliance was officially signed yesterday morning, and this situation forced the Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance. Secondly, it is expected that Germany and Italy will force Japan to join the tripartite military alliance in the near future. Again, countries with anti-aggression or being in danger of aggression will continue to join the Anglo-Soviet-French alliance group.</p>
<p>In this situation, the most noteworthy thing is the diplomatic trends of our × people. Their diplomatic policy up to today is indeed to establish two factions: (1) The elders and important ministers of the stable faction still do not approve of rashly joining the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance, thereby offending democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. (2) However, the young military officers strongly emphasize joining. Recently, the consistent advocacy of "National News" and the active anti-British sentiment in the occupied areas of China are clear evidence of this. However, it has troubled the old man Hiranuma, who is in a dilemma, and to this day he is still ambiguous, saying that "Japan's national policy is based on justice and morality," alas!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Recent Developments in China's Education and Culture: Continued Increase in Funding for Frontier Education and Further Advancement of Facilities <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) Since the Ministry of Education established the Mongolian-Tibetan Education Department in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), it has been actively carrying out frontier education and has achieved considerable results over the years. A summary is extracted below:</p>
<p>(Frontier Education Funding)</p>
<p>Regarding the planning and allocation of frontier education funding, the Ministry of Education and the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission discussed it several times in the 20th, 21st, and 22nd years of the Republic (1931-1933) to promote the frontier education program. In the end, the annual budget was only 50,000 yuan. In addition to the Mongolian Affairs Commission separately subsidizing the existing schools with excellent results in the frontier areas, subsidizing frontier students to study further, and providing appropriate subsidies to frontier cultural groups, there was no surplus available for distribution. The proposed plans were not realized. The Ministry of Education, in view of the complexity of the frontier issue, believed that if a cultural foundation was not established urgently, political and educational construction would be impossible. Therefore, in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), it designated 500,000 yuan within the subsidies to remote and poor provinces for the purpose of handling frontier education. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), it was increased to 640,000 yuan, designating six uses: (1) subsidizing schools with excellent results, (2) training teachers, (3) increasing the number of primary schools, (4) increasing the number of social education institutions, (5) subsidizing frontier students to study further, and (6) compiling and printing textbooks and books.</p>
<p>(School Education)</p>
<p>The frontier schools subsidized by the Ministry of Education include one Mongolian-Tibetan-Hui teacher training class attached to the Lanzhou Rural Normal School in Gansu Province, 55 primary schools, one Xining Mongolian-Tibetan Simple Normal School in Qinghai Province, two middle schools, 143 primary schools, two Mongolian Banner Normal School classes in Ningxia Province, 14 primary schools, one Kangding Simple Normal School in Xikang Province, 5 primary schools, three Border Simple Normal Schools in Yunnan Province (reported to be ten, but no detailed report has been received by the Ministry, so only those that have been reported are listed), 35 primary schools, one Guiyang Rural Normal School in Guizhou Province, 12 primary schools, two Pingshan and Maoxian Simple Normal Schools in Sichuan Province, 15 primary schools, one teacher training class in the Xiangxi Special Zone in Hunan Province, 100 short-term primary schools, five Mongolian-Hui normal school classes attached to the Dihua Normal School in Xinjiang Province, and one Aksu Simple Normal School, 1,412 primary schools, one National Suiyuan Mongolian Banner Normal School in Suiyuan Province, subsidizing one Tumote Banner Middle School, 29 primary schools, 13 Mongolian Banner Primary Schools in Chahar Province (all closed down in Chahar, only four primary schools in Suiyuan continue to operate), one special teacher training institute in Guangxi Province, 541 primary schools, and one Lhasa First Primary School in Tibet. In total, there are 12 normal schools, plus nine classes, two middle schools, and 3,270 primary schools.</p>
<p>(Social Education)</p>
<p>The social education institutions subsidized by the Ministry of Education include one Ningxia Provincial Mongolian Banner Education Touring Work Group, one Labbuleng Tibetan Cultural Promotion Association Touring Education Team, one Mongolian Cultural Center (now closed), one Chahar Second Touring Social Education Center (now closed), and one Chahar Twelve Banner Group Mongolian Translation Center (now suspended). Temple Education: In order to improve temple education, the Ministry of Education, together with the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, issued a notice to the education departments of various border provinces and the Mongolian-Tibetan local governments to urge local temples to establish public schools or supplementary schools for the nearby people and monks to study. In Islamic mosques, Awen schools attached to them were also ordered to increase subjects such as national language knowledge and arithmetic, and to use the time of lecturing on scriptures in various temples to give spiritual lectures and carry out literacy campaigns, and to find ways to train lamas, monks, and Ahongs.</p>
<p>(Preferential Treatment for Students)</p>
<p>In order to encourage Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui students to enter specialized schools and above in the interior, the Ministry of Education has allocated special funds to subsidize them since the 25th year of the Republic (1936), with a subsidy of 300 yuan per person per year. In addition, travel expenses are also issued at the Ministry’s discretion. On average, dozens of people are subsidized each year. Cultural Lectures: In order to communicate Han-Tibetan culture, the Ministry of Education added Tibetan cultural lectures to five universities, including Central, Tsinghua, Wuhan, Sun Yat-sen, and Peking Universities, in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), and specially hired Geshe Sherab Gyatso of Tibet to teach. Textbook Compilation and Translation: The situation in the frontier is special, and the languages are different. Ordinary textbooks cannot be applied. The Ministry of Education separately compiles, translates, prints, and distributes them for application. At present, "Han-Mongolian Bilingual" textbooks, eight volumes of primary school national language, four volumes of common sense, four books of the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Text, four volumes of short-term primary school textbooks, "Han-Tibetan Bilingual" textbooks, four volumes of primary school national language, four volumes of public school textbooks, and three volumes of "Han-Hui Bilingual" primary school textbooks have been compiled. In addition, eight volumes of Han-Tibetan bilingual textbooks submitted by Xikang and five volumes of Han-Tibetan readers submitted by the Han-Tibetan Buddhist Academy have been reviewed, but the content is not perfect, and methods are being sought to revise them.</p>
<p>(Improvement Matters)</p>
<p>(1) "Expansion of the Scope of Frontier Education Facilities." The frontier ethnic groups are complex, the culture is backward, and the situations in various places are different. Not only the Mongolian areas must adapt to the environment to implement education, but also the Hui people in Xinjiang, the Tuban people in Qinghai, and the various ethnic groups in the southwestern border areas, their languages, customs, and habits are very different from those in the interior. We should proceed from their actual needs to promote education in various places, so that it is easier to achieve results. Therefore, the scope of work of the Mongolian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education has spread to various border areas. (2) Correct the name of mixed teaching. The purpose of frontier education is to integrate national and cultural identity. If each establishes its own name and marks punctuation, it is no different from dividing the entire Chinese nation. If students of each ethnic group are taught separately, feelings cannot be connected. Therefore, the Ministry of Education ordered various border schools to use the place name as the school name, and enroll students regardless of ethnicity, and implement mixed teaching to eliminate the boundaries between ethnic groups. (3) "Taking the national language as the center of teaching." The main reason for the emotional separation of ethnic minorities is the difference in language. Therefore, the first task of frontier education must be to make the frontier people understand the national language, so that there is no so-called barrier, which can be eliminated invisibly. (4) "Frontier education" is gradually changed from a subsidy method to direct management by the central government. Because the politics of various frontier areas are not on the right track, there are many obstacles to the promotion of frontier education. Therefore, on the one hand, the old educational institutions are being reorganized and subsidies are continuing to be provided. On the other hand, national normal schools are being gradually established to control teachers, experimental primary schools are being established to guide local education, national middle schools are being established to absorb young people, border schools are being established to cultivate construction talents, and frontier schools are being established as the center for researching and promoting education in various regions. In this way, frontier education can be gradually controlled by the central government, so that it can proceed smoothly under a certain plan and direction.</p>
<p>Adult Education</p>
<p>Guangxi Pays Attention to Promotion, Which Other Provinces Can Emulate</p>
<p>[Guilin Correspondence] Liujiang is a very important county among the ninety-nine counties in Guangxi. The total area of the county is 7,182 square miles, divided into five towns and thirty townships, 429 villages and streets, and a population of over 238,800. Among them, there are 18,767 adults who have dropped out of school (according to the statistics in March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938)). After the Liujiang County Government was ordered to hold adult education, it decided on the following seven methods.</p>
<p>Establish a Promotion Committee</p>
<p>(1) Establish a promotion adult education committee. The committee was officially announced this month and is specifically responsible for promoting adult education, striving to eliminate illiteracy, popularize public education, strengthen public mobilization, and exert the power of the war of resistance and national construction within this year. (2) Publicity: Village and street chiefs, school teachers, and enthusiastic educators will work hard to publicize the importance of adult education at village and street people's congresses or other gatherings. The Liuzhou Daily has also published a "Special Issue on Adult Education for War," expanding publicity to encourage the public to actively participate in group activities.</p>
<p>Train Adult Education Teachers</p>
<p>(3) Training of teachers: There are a total of 429 villages and streets in the county, and each village and street must have one full-time adult education teacher, requiring a total of 429 adult education teachers. Moreover, because this year's adult education is different from the past narrow literacy campaign and remedial education, it is necessary to establish a teacher training class for teachers and conduct short-term training for all teachers. In the first phase, in addition to separately transferring teachers from township primary schools for training, an examination system will be implemented to select true talents. It is estimated that more than 160 teachers will be trained in this phase. The class has already started. After completing the class and training for ten days, they will go to the villages and streets of the township to take on adult education work. (4) Establishment of adult education classes: There are a total of 429 villages and streets in the county. Each village and street is scheduled to set up one or two adult classes, with one full-time teacher, with a monthly living allowance of 10 yuan in national currency. After the two classes are over, there will be an additional subsidy of 5 yuan in national currency. The number of people is stipulated to be at least 30 people per class and no more than 60 people. (5) Establishment of model adult classes: This is stipulated in Article 8 of the adult education program of this province. Each county should specially invite secondary schools and central schools with excellent performance to hold model adult classes to set an example for other schools. Now, the county has decided that the Liuzhou Provincial Junior High School and the private Longcheng Junior High School will each establish a model adult class as an example for other schools.

<h3 id="e3">Japanese Economic Plunder in North China (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>In addition to excessive issuance of paper money, they also try their best to absorb it. There are also many ways to absorb it. Gu Yina Huaxiong, the head of the Taiyuan Special Affairs Agency, announced: Chinese Bank and Bank of Communications banknotes circulating in the market, except those printed with Tianjin, Qingdao, and guerrilla designations, must be exchanged for banknotes of the Chinese Reserve Bank before June 10 (last year). But in reality, the Chinese people's distrust of counterfeit banknotes has negated the effectiveness of this method. The common people would rather hoard them at home than exchange them for counterfeit money. Therefore, the Japanese method of absorbing legal tender can only rely on exorbitant taxes and wanton plunder.</p>
<p>B. Establishing Agricultural Loan Institutions:</p>
<p>The widespread establishment of agricultural loan institutions by the Japanese in various places is also, in fact, for the purpose of carrying out exploitation.</p>
<p>In June of last year, the puppet Hebei Provincial Bank handled agricultural loans in Cang County, Hebei, investing a total of 150,000 yuan. Farmers who borrowed money had to follow the established regulations, using land deeds as collateral, and repay the loans within a limited time. If they failed to repay the loans by the deadline, the land would be confiscated.</p>
<p>How could the vast majority of farmers under the oppression of exorbitant taxes imposed by the Japanese be able to repay loans with interest doubled on time? As a result, their land was only confiscated by the Japanese.</p>
<p>II. In the Industrial Sphere</p>
<p>A. The Puppet Provisional Government Restructuring Existing Mining Rights:</p>
<p>In June of last year, the puppet provisional government abolished all the provisions of the current mining law revised in the 21st year of the Republic of China. According to the original regulations, more than half of the shares of a mining company must be owned by Chinese, more than half of the directors and the chairman and general manager must be Chinese, and coal, steel, copper, kerosene, etc., should be state-owned in principle... These regulations, of course, hindered the Japanese economic conspiracy. The puppet provisional government, using the excuse that "these regulations are exclusionary," simply abolished them all! Existing mining rights were completely dissolved, and a fake "Mining Law Ordinance" was re-promulgated. The transfer of mining rights and other related dispositions are invalid without the special permission of the puppet government. Therefore, all coal and iron mines and other enterprises operated by tens of thousands of people were completely transferred to the Japanese.</p>
<p>B. Actively Developing Industries in North China:</p>
<p>In May of last year, the puppet Japan-China Economic Association drafted concrete plans for developing industries in North China. The following is a special introduction:</p>
<p>1. "Rural Rehabilitation Plan"</p>
<p>The North China Rural Development Nine-Year Plan aims to increase cotton production by 10 million dan and wheat production by 128 million dan...</p>
<p>2. Cooperative Organization Plan:</p>
<p>The North China Agricultural Implementation Agency Cooperative is a unit cooperative based on each village. Above it are the county federation, the provincial federation, and the central federation, forming a systematic cooperative organization. The Department of Industry and the Xinmin Association are responsible for technical guidance.</p>
<p>3. Cotton Production Increase Plan:</p>
<p>Establish the North China Cotton Production Association as a direct guidance and incentive agency responsible for implementing the cotton production increase plan, and decide on the "Nine-Year Production Increase Plan."</p>
<p>4. Agricultural Experiment Station Unification Plan:</p>
<p>The agricultural experiment stations formerly scattered in various provinces will be integrated and reorganized under the management of the provinces or counties, and placed under the control of the Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to improve agriculture..."</p>
<p>5. Industries in North China, such as transportation, communications, electricity, iron ore, coal mining, salt production, soda industry, and coal liquefaction, are of crucial importance and are designated as controlled joint ventures.</p>
<p>6. Welcome the participation of third-country funds.</p>
<p>In September of last year, the puppet Japan-China Economic Association decided on three items of the "Economic Cooperation Outline" at its fourth meeting: 1. Increase cotton production, 2. Promote trade, and 3. Develop industries. In the item of developing industries, it specifically pointed out that "the five important industries in North China, coal, iron, electricity, salt, and coal liquefaction, must be developed as much as possible." These five industries are necessities for military industry, which shows the Japanese preparation for a long-term war of aggression. In addition to this, the development of other industries also has wartime characteristics. The purpose of the Japanese is, on the one hand, for exploitation, and on the other hand, for military purposes. Now, we will briefly describe the Japanese industrial institutions that have been established in several provinces in North China and the exploitation situation to show the conspiracy of Japanese economic aggression.</p>
<p>(1) Coal Mines: The salt deposits in North China's coal reserves are the richest, with Shanxi being the foremost. The coal quality is divided into bituminous coal and anthracite. The production areas are divided into those inside and outside Niangziguan. The coal produced in Jingxing and other places outside the pass is "bituminous coal," commonly known as "smoky coal." The coal produced in Yangquan and other places inside the pass is "anthracite." After the fall of Taiyuan, the Japanese actively mined it. Last year, it was assigned to the management of the Fourth Factory under the puppet army. After the factory took over the Yangquan Baojin Company, it divided the mining area managed by the factory into fourteen areas, and recruited a large number of workers to actively excavate.</p>
<p>The coal mining area of Dongshan Xishan near Taiyuan also has quite rich reserves. It belongs to the Fifth Factory developed by the puppet army. After the Japanese implemented an economic blockade in October last year, they designated the puppet Liu Da Company as the sole agent for exclusive sales. The Liu Da Company opened a large coal storage factory outside the Shouyi Gate in Taiyuan to operate sales.</p>
<p>The Datong Kouquan Coal Mine in northern Shanxi is managed by the puppet North Autonomous Government. The Fujia Coal Mine between Ling Shi in Jinan County is also designated as the Forty-Second Factory under the puppet army, preparing for excavation.</p>
<p>Hebei is also quite rich in coal production. The Japanese have a close relationship with the Kailuan Yanhmei and the ironmaking industry. In September of last year, they invested 5 million yuan and formulated a production increase plan. The current annual production volume is more than 5 million tons.</p>
<p>The Shandong coal mines along the Jiaoji Railway are all managed by the puppet Qingdao Luda Mining Company. The company also took over the various coal mines formerly managed by Chinese businessmen. In the past, the company's annual production volume reached more than 3 million tons. After the Incident, sales were hindered, and it dropped to about 1 million tons. Recently, the Japanese decided to revive it and invested 7 million yuan. The monthly coal output of each mining area is currently 400 tons in Boshan, 800 tons in Dakunlun, 200 tons in Hongshan, and about 500 tons in Pule, Kengzi, etc. (2) Iron Ore: The Japanese attach great importance to the mining of iron ore. At the end of the twenty-sixth year, the Siyekou Xingzhong Company began to develop the Xuanhua and Longyan iron mines, and established a company management in the Yanjianshan mining area, expanding the material factory as well. In addition, they also mined ore in the Sanxakou-Xinyao mining area under Longguan County.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese deeply felt the need for iron ore. In November of last year, the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Okura companies extensively collected scrap iron, ancient bronze, coins, scrap lead, shell casings, etc. in various parts of North China. The collection was extremely large.</p>
<p>(3) Gold Mines: The gold mine in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, is extremely rich in reserves. In the past, during the Jidong government era, there were many small-scale mining companies. However, due to weak capital and the use of indigenous methods, they were almost completely shut down. In July of last year, the Xingzhong Company and the Sumitomo Corporation jointly formed a North China Gold Mining Company, which was established in Tianjin to engage in the mining of gold mines in Zunhua.</p>
<p>In the past, the gold mine in Dai County, Shanxi Province, was also mined using indigenous methods. It is heard that recently the Japanese have sent technicians from a certain company to conduct a thorough investigation. It is thought that they also have excavation plans.</p>
<p>(4) Electrical Undertakings: The Japanese have not developed any electrical undertakings in North China. Recently, the Japanese claimed that they will establish an "Electricity Committee" in Beiping. There has been a slight improvement in the electrical aspects. In July of last year, telegraphic contact began between Chahar-Suiyuan, Manchuria, and North China. However, the contact method relies not only on the external telecommunications contact method adopted by the Directorate General of Posts, but also on the wireless telegraphs of the Zhangjiakou and Datong telegraph offices for contact between Chahar-Suiyuan and Manchuria. For contact between North China and Suiyuan-Chahar, the original telegraph lines between Zhangjiakou and Beiping are used. Later, in September, a two-layer automatic telegraph line was erected between Zhangjiakou and Chengde.</p>
<p>Petroleum, the raw material necessary for the electrical undertakings, is controlled by the Japanese. In July of last year, the "North China Petroleum Control Company" was established, purchasing the old Dahua Petroleum Company and purchasing crude oil for refining and sale.</p>
<p>(5) Salt: The Changlu Salt Field, which has been a case for a long time, was decided by the Xingzhong Company to be developed in June of last year. The plan is to develop a new salt field of 5,000 '町步' (chōbu), and the capacity of the salt washing factory will also be increased. In early July, the abandoned salt flats of Dongda Gaozi Salt Ziqiaonan were also reorganized, and it was scheduled that salt could be officially produced in the spring of last year.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese controlled salt, the people have felt a lack of salt. At the same time, under the deception and oppression of Japanese merchants, market prices have risen sharply, and it has become difficult for the people to eat salt. Since last year, in the coastal areas of Hebei, farmers in Cang County, Yanshan, and other places have mostly made saltpeter privately. People nearby scrambled to sell it. Later, it was discovered by the Japanese, who thought that it greatly affected the sales of Changlu Salt, and they completely confiscated the salt fields and salt ponds in various places. The Xingzhong Company also decided to use the original salt farmers in the Cangyan area to develop industrial salt, which would be specially supplied to domestic 亶達 industrial, nitrate, and all chemical industries.</p>
<p>The Yuncheng Salt Pond in Shanxi has a large production capacity. In the past, in addition to supplying Jinan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, and other places also relied on it. In March of last year, the Japanese occupied Yuncheng and completely confiscated the Hedong Salt from the salt pond. They also recruited workers to engage in production, but because the area around the salt pond was where our guerrillas haunted, the working hours of the general salt workers and the area of the salt fields they worked on were not far away. Therefore, the production volume was not high. Currently, most of the edible salt in Shanxi is still Changlu Salt.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of salt produced along the coast of Shandong. Qingdao, especially near the sea, produces more salt. The annual export volume of Qingdao salt to Japan and Korea reaches about 1,000 tons.</p>
<p>(6) Agricultural Products: In addition to the above-mentioned departments, the agricultural development of North China is also actively underway. The Japanese lack food and attempt to collect it from China. Therefore, after seizing Chahar-Suiyuan, the puppet Meng district United Weaving Association and the puppet Chanan Menglian Jinbei three autonomous governments first amended the land law and land consolidation law, setting a three-year plan. Each puppet government set up a central test.</p>
<p>In Taiyuan, since the beginning of July last year, the export of miscellaneous boxes has been controlled, and a "Miscellaneous Grain Transportation Association" has been established, but in fact, it is all manipulated by the Japanese. Chinese merchants who joined the association all lost money. Later, the Chinese merchants repeatedly requested that many exports be made outside of the members of the association, but they were all rejected. As a result, most of the Chinese merchants withdrew from the association, but secretly transported food to the guerrilla areas. The Japanese felt panicked about food and often sent soldiers to the countryside to plunder. This is a serious military problem that the Japanese feel most anxious about.</p>
<p>(7) Cotton Production: Cotton products are also one of the military supplies. The Japanese have always relied heavily on China. After capturing Hebei, they set up the "Hebei Cotton Production Improvement Association" and formulated a five-year production increase plan, established the "North China Cotton Company," and actively reorganized cotton markets and factories in Zhengding, Zhangde, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and other places.</p>
<p>The Japanese did not expect that most of the Chinese people would participate in the war. Although they worked hard, the result was that the production volume in the year after the war was far less than before the Incident. Supply could not meet demand, and cotton prices soared. The price of North China cotton delivered in Osaka was about 1,000 yuan higher than that of American cotton. The Japanese tried to increase exports to Japan several times, but the result was a complete trade export cutoff. The Japanese are at their wit's end, as can be seen from this.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Special Affairs Bureau of the puppet provisional government planned to establish a North China Cotton Production Increase Guidance Agency, with the general headquarters in Beiping and branch offices in various provinces. Branch offices will also be established in various counties, and it is planned to be established this year.</p>
<p>(8) Flour: The Taiyuan puppet army manages the Second and Seventh factories, the former sites of the Electric Light Company and the Flour Company, to supply flour to various puppet military and political institutions in Shanxi. Although the current output is not as high as in the past, the Japanese often do not have to publicly purchase wheat when they buy small wheat, so they can of course make a profit. This is the general method used by the Japanese.</p>
<p>In addition to Taiyuan, there are still three flour factories set up in Shanxi. Linfen is the Thirty-First Factory managed by the puppet army, equipped with decorative electric wheels. Zaoyuan is the Thirtieth Factory managed by the puppet army, which is smaller in scale and has only dozens of workers. Yuci (outside the North Gate, the old Jinfeng Flour Factory) is also assigned to the Twelfth Factory managed by the puppet army. In December of last year, the Seventh Factory managed by the puppet army repaired and restored the Second Factory of the old Jinfeng Flour Company in Yuncheng, and attempted to start production recently.</p>
<p>Among the largest flour factories in the Japanese-occupied area of Shandong, the Qingdao Sanji Flour Company of the Mitsui Group is the most important. Currently, Sanji's directly affiliated factories include the Qingdao, Jinan, and Tianjin factories. The factories whose operations have already been entrusted to it include the Jiazhiyan in Jinan, and the Zhongyang and Shuangfu factories in Qingdao.</p>
<p>(9) Tobacco and Alcohol: After the War of Resistance, 19 of the paper cigarette companies in Pingjin went bankrupt because most of the raw materials for various paper cigarettes were collected from the interior. After the widespread development of guerrilla warfare, it became impossible to transport raw materials to the Japanese-occupied areas, so the companies were unable to work due to lack of raw materials. At the same time, they were unable to exist under the strong seizure and theft of the Japanese. As a result, they could only go bankrupt. The general price increase of paper cigarettes is based on this reason.</p>
<p>The Pingjin liquor industry is also the same. Chinese liquor merchants have gradually disappeared, and the imported Western liquor has also decreased compared to before. Almost all the liquor flooding the market is imported from Japan, especially the Kirin and Asahi brands.</p>
<p>In September of last year, the Kowa Tobacco Company of North China initiated the organization of the North China Tobacco Control Company, with the general headquarters in Qingdao and offices in Beiping and Tokyo. The buying and selling of tobacco leaves, the warehousing industry, and the management of the transportation industry are all controlled and operated by the puppet company. At the same time, the puppet Shandong Tobacco Co., Ltd. was also established in Shandong, with Sunguo Haruhi, a Japanese national, as the chairman. It was jointly formed by the East Asia and Manchuria Tobacco Companies.</p>
<p>Shanxi tobacco leaves also adopted control methods, and the import of silk cigarettes from other provinces was prohibited. The 13th Factory managed by the puppet army (the former site of the Jinhua Cigarette Factory) was extremely meticulously operated, but due to lack of raw materials and stagnation of sales, the business was in a very dilapidated state. The brands produced include Xu, Liming, Xiehe, and Xingfu. They are sealed in beautiful packaging boxes with propaganda pictures, and injected with drugs. In June of last year, the public ate and smoked. Such cigarettes often caused death from poisoning. The danger of the Japanese conspiracy has reached this point.</p>
<p>(10) Alcohol and Foreign Coal: Among the alcohol factories with a slightly larger scale in North China, the Datong Alcohol Factory is the most important. The puppet Jinbei Autonomous Government reorganized the alcohol manufacturing factory operated by the Northwest Industrial Company, renaming it the "Jinbei Xingnong Alcohol Factory." It began operations in early August last year. The local puppet organization tried its best to collect beans, sorghum, and corn as raw materials for manufacturing.</p>
<p>In the past, the North China cement industry was mostly monopolized by the Tangshan Qixin Cement Company. The annual output was about 300,000 tons or more. After the incident, due to security and transportation, its output was greatly reduced. In Taiyuan, the Japanese entrusted the operation of the old Northwest Cement Plant to the Asano Cement Company. It is currently under repair. In Jinan, the Zhijing Cement Company was also taken over by the 盤城灰 Company, but the output is very small.</p>
<p>(11) Match Industry: In November of last year, the puppet provisional government of Beiping drafted a concrete plan for the "Match Joint Operation Society." The outline is divided into three points: (1) Restricting production, (2) Banning smuggled goods, and (3) Centralized sales. However, its purpose is nothing more than to control the entire North China match enterprise. Qingdao is the most developed place for matches. The North China Match Factory, the Zhenye Match Factory, and the Qingqing Match Company have all been exclusively occupied by Japanese merchants. They started operations in September of last year. Most of the weaves in the Pingjin area are sent here.</p>
<p>Among the largest scale of the Qingdao Match Company and other scale companies, the "North China Match Company" is the largest. It was reorganized from the former Qingdao Match Company. The chairman is Utagawa, a Japanese national, and the vice chairman is Yang Zungui.</p>
<p>(12) Leather and Wool: The North China leather is most prevalent in Suiyuan. Now that the military is busy, leather, wool, and military necessities are very important, so the Japanese attach great importance to the livestock industry in Jin-Sui. The purpose is to grab large amounts of leather and wool for his combat needs.</p>
<p>Due to the importance of leather and wool, attention is paid to livestock. The Japanese conduct control methods as usual. In August of last year, the Civil Affairs Department of the puppet Chanan government prohibited the export of livestock. While instructing various police agencies to strictly monitor, it also set up a livestock monitoring station at the Kangzhuang Station on the Ping-Sui line to strictly prohibit private entry and exit.</p>
<p>The exclusive purchase right for the control of West sheepskins belongs to the 16th Factory managed by the puppet army (the former site of the Northwest Industrial Company Woolen Factory). A purchasing headquarters is set up in the factory, and purchasing offices are set up in Yuci, Xin County, Pingyao, Xinjiang, Quwo, Xiaoyi and other counties. The purchase price is determined by the Japanese Special Affairs Bureau in Taiyuan. If the factory does not need it, the rest can be exported, but it must be implemented with the permission of the Japanese Special Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Shanxi's leather production is the first in North China. In 1936, there were 2,454,000 pieces of cowhide and 8,956,000 pieces of sheepskin. Due to the Japanese conspiracy to capture and provide for military supplies, the purchase office has been entrusted to the 17th Factory managed by the puppet army (the site of the Northwest Industrial Public Company), and purchasing branch offices have been set up in Yuci, Shouyang, Fenyang, Linfen, Xinjiang, and other places. The transaction is mainly bartering. When the goods arrive, gold tickets are exchanged. Leather is an important military raw material, so it is necessary to contact the Japanese military authorities during the purchase and follow the instructions and orders of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The Construction Department of the puppet provincial government of Shandong established the "Livestock Breeding Improvement Farm" in September of last year, and also set up a livestock disease prevention and control institute, but because the scale is very small, there are no achievements.</p>
<p>Finally</p>
<p>Looking at the various conspiracies of the Japanese in North China, in the economic sphere, they are intensifying the exploitation and development of the resources and wealth of the occupied areas, and at the same time using various methods to destroy and disrupt China's economy and finance, in order to destroy the material basis of China's resistance. In international trade, after the Japanese seized control of customs and key transportation routes, they tried their best to exclude British and American commerce and dumped Japanese goods. In the financial sphere, they tried their best to issue counterfeit banknotes of the United Reserve Bank, forced the people to use them, and pursued the exchange of sand coins, attempting to buy legal tender and counterfeit legal tender for private exchange of foreign exchange, and forcibly set the exchange rate of counterfeit currency, hoping to disrupt China's gold standard. This is the general conspiracy of the Japanese economic strategy. The department of aggression belongs to the activities of the Japanese company and has considerable achievements, as far as far. It belongs to the secret nature, although it is actively planned, and there is no result, so it is temporarily absent. Wait for the next day to continue. (Minge Society)</p>

<h3 id="e6">British, American, and French Consuls in Xiamen Protest to × Consul, Demanding Rapid Withdrawal of Landing × Troops, × Consul's Reply Still Evasive <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Gulanyu, 22nd] External Dispatch: The Consular representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France jointly lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul in Xiamen yesterday, stating that the Japanese side, under the pretext of suppressing terrorist activities, has dispatched troops to forcibly occupy the Gulangyu International Settlement in order to attack the Chinese army defense line on land. The dispatch from the three powers demanded the prompt withdrawal of Japanese troops and the restoration of the settlement to its pre-occupation state. The main points of the protest letter are as follows: (1) Anti-Japanese terrorist incidents in the settlement are not as prevalent as the Japanese side claims. Before the Japanese troops landed, only two incidents occurred, one of which was committed by a Taiwanese person. Since the landing of Japanese troops, the order and tranquility of the settlement have been disrupted by the illegal searches and arrests of Japanese patrols. (2) The Japanese side claims that the landing of Japanese troops is to protect Japanese residents and pro-Japanese elements, which is merely a pretext to build machine gun positions on Gulangyu to attack the Chinese army positions on the mainland opposite the island. (3) The need for protection of residents is not limited to Japan. If the original state is not immediately restored, other relevant countries will take effective measures to protect the residents, interests, and rights under law of their respective countries on the island. The Japanese Consul in Xiamen, Uchida, has already replied to this protest, but his reply remains evasive and provides no definite answers.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Beijing Dispatch] The local police bureau has ordered each branch bureau to select officers to patrol public places and prohibit criticism of current affairs. Those who "deliberately spread rumors to disrupt public order" may be arrested. This measure is clearly an attempt to deceive the public, fearing that news of Chinese victories will spread among the people, and also to conceal the Japanese army's × actions.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Committee Member Yu Youren reported at the Central Commemoration Week on the 22nd, stating in essence that the flames of the War of Resistance over the past two years have forged the scattered Chinese nation into iron. The recently convened production conference is like the engine of a huge machine. The President's instructions, President Kong's speech, and the suggestions of various experts at the conference have already demonstrated the highest principles and implementation steps for our production and construction. This is the great gain of this production conference. He concluded that war is cruel but also the mother of culture. Therefore, he hoped that scholars, experts, and all working compatriots across the country would mobilize their spirits, work hard to produce, and strive to create a new China of culture, which will soon arrive.</p>

However, the disaster situation in various places has expanded, the number of refugees has increased sharply, and the restoration of Mufu County, which suffered particularly heavy damage, requires more assistance. He requested the Central Government to allocate an additional 200,000 yuan to be used as special funds for central government consolation to the recovered counties. Mr. Han has also telegraphed the Central Government for instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Shanghai × Attempts to Revise Tax Rates Again, Excluding European and American Goods, Forcibly Burning British Goods in Occupied Areas, Instructing Puppets to Expel British Residents <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Shanghai dispatch: After the entire tariff of our customs was altered once under the pressure of the × side on June 1st of last year, it is now learned that the × side is not satisfied with this and will once again alter the entire tariff of the Jianghai Customs, further reducing the tax rate on × goods entering the country. If this matter materializes, the goods of European and American countries will be completely excluded from the Chinese market. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States are paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai Dispatch] Burning British goods has become a regular activity in the anti-British movement in Japanese-occupied areas of China. In some cities, they have even gone so far as to search houses for British goods. The supporters of this movement claim that the United Kingdom is responsible for the current Sino-Japanese War. This move is clearly instructed by the Japanese military authorities. The puppet government in Nanjing under the command of the Japanese military is the puppet of this movement, expressing the need to prevent British influence from penetrating China. There are three steps to this movement: (1) Instilling anti-British education in the Chinese people. (2) Boycotting British goods. (3) Expelling British missionaries and merchants from the country. Although the third task mentioned above is still pending, the puppets responding to this movement hope to first lay a certain foundation, shouting anti-British slogans at anti-British rallies.</p>
<p>× Sabotages the Settlement, Three Consuls Issue Warning</p>
<p>[Shanghai, 22nd] The British, American, and French Consuls jointly issued a warning to the × side yesterday, demanding that the × side immediately cease all illegal sabotage activities in the settlement, otherwise the United Kingdom, the United States, and France would take direct and effective action to protect the safety of the settlement. At the same time, they declared that the × side would bear full responsibility for any serious incidents caused by the × side's illegal actions in the future.</p>
<p>Shops in the Settlement Receive Intimidation Letters from ×</p>
<p>In the past two days, various shops in the settlement have successively received intimidation letters from the × side printed in ink, stating that all shops must accept the counterfeit banknotes of the Huaxing Bank from today and must not discriminate against them, otherwise drastic measures will be taken. The various shops believe that this move by the × side is clearly intended to disrupt our financial system and sabotage commerce in the settlement. They have reported to the police and requested their utmost protection. They have also reported to the Chamber of Commerce and will convene an emergency joint meeting soon to discuss countermeasures. As a result, they unanimously resolved to firmly refuse to use counterfeit banknotes and to not fear any intimidation.</p>
<p>Results of Search in the Settlement Reportedly Lead to Multiple Arrests</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 22nd] The settlement authorities are remaining silent regarding the results of the large-scale search of residents by military and police personnel on Friday. According to usually reliable sources, twelve people were arrested. It is heard that they are related to politics and are engaged in anti-Japanese activities in the Shanghai settlement. Among them, eight people were arrested in the French Concession, and four people were arrested in the International Settlement.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Sketches of Haifeng <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ming</p>
<p>Haifeng is a major county in the Dongjiang region. During the revolutionary era, it had some amazing feats. When the Guanghui-Shantou highway was ×, the market was prosperous. × People scolded travelers if they were going to Shantou (or from Shantou to Guangzhou), they must stay here for one night, and then catch the car early in the morning. Unfortunately, after the landing of the Japanese × people at Daya Bay, the highway was destroyed, and it was difficult for the market to return to its former prosperity.</p>
<p>The author recently made a brief stay in the county and will do his best to provide readers with an honest and concise report on the local customs, culture, and education. Although the report contains more pessimism than optimism, the author still fervently hopes that local authorities and Haifeng's professionals will be able to jointly overcome difficulties and move towards the road of construction!</p>
<p>I. Culture, Education, and Construction in Haifeng</p>
<p>Haifeng's local taxes are levied heavily, but its culture, education, and construction are all beyond people's expectations. Haifeng County only has one bookstore. The bookstore also sells old clothes. The glass cabinet is full of books, ancient texts, Tang poems, and large-sized books on history and classics. I × bought a "Sing Together" songbook. I searched the entire Haifeng County but couldn't find it. From this, it can be seen how low the county's cultural level is. Magazines certainly need not be mentioned. Even newspapers such as Hong Kong's Shen Bao and Ta Kung Pao are not available for single purchase. The total number of Hong Kong newspapers subscribed to in the county is less than 30 copies. The entire × has a Kuomintang branch that publishes a Republic of China Daily (a four-page newspaper, most of the news is reprinted from Shantou newspapers and Hong Kong newspapers). Other culturally related undertakings (radios, movies, public sports grounds, etc.) are mostly lacking.</p>
<p>Haifeng County's education funds were usually 170,000 yuan per year. After the outbreak of the South China War, it was reduced to more than 70,000 yuan. Now, it is said that because the tax × is known to be inept, the education funds in the county's budget for the 28th year account for only more than 30,000 yuan. From this budget, we can imagine the state of education in the entire Haifeng County. Even 30,000 yuan is not enough to run a junior high school, and this 30,000 yuan is still the entire county's education funding. How can education be popularized among the people of Haifeng? How can illiteracy be eliminated? Although Haifeng has a Mass Education Center, it is also limited by funding and cannot make any great contribution to mass education. Furthermore, Haifeng's primary school teachers only receive 9 yuan per month for food (this refers to county-run primary schools). I don't know how many primary schools there are in Haifeng County. As for district-run and township-run primary schools, it is said that teachers can only get a maximum of 50 yuan per semester. It is said that middle school teachers are only volunteers (Haifeng County only has one junior high school and one fisheries school). With such meager treatment of teachers, how can they have the spirit to teach?</p>
<p>Haifeng has many × fields and wasteland. If someone were to cultivate them, I think it would increase a lot of income every year. Unfortunately, the local propertied class is abandoning this natural and excellent environment. Nine-tenths of Haifeng County's mountains are bare. Why not promote a large-scale afforestation movement? Because there are too few trees, Haifeng, although close to the sea, has a cold climate ×. It means Central ×, wind disasters, and floods. There is no year to be great.</p>
<p>The local people are very conservative ×. The buildings of the shops are at most two stories high. It is said that the reason why the general wealthy families dare not build Western-style buildings is because they have seen Chen Jiongming's Western-style buildings become dilapidated ruins. They believe that Haifeng's land is not suitable for building large Western-style buildings!</p>
<p>I am very reluctant to criticize the local authorities in the Liaodong area, because it is really disappointing. Taking Haifeng's construction as an example, the sounds of repairing the road have been going on for more than a year, but the road cement is still breaking day by day. Not long ago, a Councilor Yao from the ×th War Zone Command came to Haifeng to inspect and saw workers repairing the road. Three days later, Councilor Yao × went to Yuning, and the people repairing the road also disappeared.</p>
<p>II. Haifeng's Customs, Habits, and Products</p>
<p>Living near Guangzhou, I suddenly rushed to Haifeng and felt that there were many facts worth reporting. For example, the local dialect is called "Hoklo," and there is one word that is completely different from Cantonese. Cantonese calls a person beautiful "gwaan" (觀), while here they call a person beautiful "seui" (衰). Cantonese friends should pay attention to the use of this word when they first come to Haifeng to avoid misunderstandings!</p>
<p>Speaking of social interactions, in Haifeng, the great principle of "men and women should not touch hands when giving and receiving" is emphasized. Even if you meet a female classmate from the same school and class on the street, even if you are willing to greet her, she will bow her head and not look at you. Naturally, women receive even more old × education. Although the sign of the Women's Association is nailed up, the work cannot be carried out. × (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Brave Men of Southern Fujian Cross the Sea in Light Boats, Night Raid Kinmen, × Troops Wake Up in Terror and Are Mostly Annihilated, Officers Award and Console the Triumphant Return <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st] The islands of Kinmen and Xiamen in southern Fujian are isolated in the sea and have been occupied by × invaders for a year. Our coastal military and civilians have been attacking the violent × and are filled with endless hatred. Brave and enthusiastic warriors × Tie ×, Chen Dayuan, and others, ×× organized a brave death squad. On the evening of the 20th of last month, taking advantage of the dark night, they crossed the sea in small boats and launched the first daring raid on Kinmen × bandits. That night, the moon was dark and the tide was surging. It took four hours to cross the Kinmen Strait and reach the other shore. After landing, they split into three teams. One team was responsible for destruction, pretending to be a decoy force. Another team went straight to the red Western-style building in Guan'ao, which was occupied by ××. They immediately killed the × sentry and × arrived downstairs. They concentrated their firepower to fire, and the sounds of machine guns and grenades were simultaneous. The × troops woke up from their dreams, panicked and fought back. In the dim light, they were annihilated for the most part. As our brave men retreated, they suddenly heard women waking up and screaming upstairs. The third team sneaked to the southeast corner of the city and took swift action, breaking into the × army's No. 10 barrack. They immediately killed 14 × soldiers, destroyed their artillery and supplies, and withdrew calmly. They boarded the boat together. As they moved away from the shore, they heard gunfire and artillery fire erupting on the island. Our brave men returned in triumph. In this operation, they captured two light machine guns, six rifles, two steel helmets, two × flags, six bayonets, six military uniforms, 142 bullets, and many other symbols and documents. The × troops annihilated were the 24th Company of the Onishi unit of the Sasebo Second Special Naval Landing Force. The names of those who can be verified are Hirabi, Pi Quan, Hasegawa, Yoshinari Kono, Tokuju Ueno, Sugimoto, Iwai Kozo, Hayashi × zo, Ito, and other 14 people, all of whom were ordinary seamen. The × troops annihilated in the Western-style building are not included. Our brave and heroic warriors only lost Zheng Liang and Chen Fu. After receiving the news, our officers commended and consoled them separately to show their sincere loyalty.</p>
<h3 id="e15">"Anti-Aggression Movement" in Kunming <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shih-huai</p>
<p>[People's Revolutionary Society, Kunming Dispatch] Kunming, a key rear area, has had to bear the heavy responsibility of maintaining the rear due to the concentration of national commerce, culture, etc. there since the War of Resistance. Therefore, on May 13th, the Kunming City and County Air Raid Emergency Relief Joint Fundraising Office held a propaganda meeting in the Provincial Kuomintang Headquarters Auditorium. Anti-Air Defense Commander Lu Jie decided to carry out large-scale propaganda in the urban and rural areas on the 14th and 15th, respectively. On the 15th, the "China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League Kunming Branch" also held its inaugural meeting. The establishment of this powerful organization to resist violent × in Kunming is of great significance. More than 800 people from various groups, agencies, schools, and provincial, municipal, and county Kuomintang Headquarters attended. First, Chairman Chen Chongren reported: "The establishment of the China Branch of the Anti-Aggression Movement League Kunming Branch is of great significance. On the one hand, it will convey the ××××××× methods to the world, so that all friendly countries in the world can understand and further give us sympathy and help. On the other hand, the purpose of the × people today is to make us suffer great sacrifices and threats, and to make us submit and be subjected to their oppression and exploitation. However, this continued result can only strengthen our determination to resist the war, and the × people have no effect to speak of. Therefore, we will also declare all this to the world and × report to the Geneva Headquarters. Vengeance for our compatriots and sanctions for ×× are the great significance of the Anti-Aggression League."</p>
<p>The Secretary-General then gave a brief speech on the topic of "The Current International Situation and Our Mission." Mr. Luo Wengan, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, further developed his grand theory from the historical perspective of China. He said: "Historically speaking, our country had the theories of 'non-aggression' and 'light troops' during the Spring and Autumn Period, which is the same as the meaning of anti-aggression today.</p>
<p>After Director Xi gave a speech, he read out the telegrams to the Geneva Headquarters and the China Branch, which were approved by applause from the audience. Our cry of "fighting for justice and humanity" and "fighting for the maintenance of world peace" will certainly inspire international people to further sanction international ×× aggressors, and the conference sent a telegram to Generalissimo Chiang and the front-line generals to pay tribute.</p>
<p>"The establishment of the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement League in Kunming today has a great historical mission, because it is a link in the global anti-aggression movement... Everyone stands on the same line and unites to resist the aggression of × day... Strive for the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation and safeguard world peace!" This solemn declaration was also passed in warm applause.</p>
<p>Although it has been raining non-stop in Kunming recently, this "torch of anti-aggression" has been firmly raised in the high sky of Kunming, like a star that shines forever, unafraid of wind or rain.</p>
<p>At around 5 o'clock, the crowd of more than a thousand people left the venue. Everyone had the same feeling: "To uphold true peace, we must rise up and overthrow this human- ××××× ×!"</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 22nd Dispatch] The Japanese yen reported another drastic fall in the unofficial market today. One hundred national currency can be exchanged for 107 Japanese yen. Therefore, the Japanese yen is only worth eight pence, which is even more different from its official price of one shilling and two pence in Tokyo. Although rumors are rampant, financial circles believe that this drastic fall in the Japanese yen is of little significance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 22nd Dispatch] The Japanese yen continues to fall, with each yen worth 93% of a national currency. The various gold and silver exchange offices in the occupied areas have recently decided on the "black market exchange rate" for counterfeit Huaxing Bank currency, that is, one yuan and six jiao is worth one national currency.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Changchun, 22nd Dispatch] According to local official reports, a Mongolian aircraft crossed the "Manchukuo" border on the 20th of this month and was shot down by "State of Zhou" machine gunners.

First, Shao Lizi, the chairman of the presidium of the conference, reported in detail on the development of the International Anti-Aggression Movement over the past year and the great contribution of our country's heroic resistance to the Anti-Aggression Movement. Then, Chairman Lin's and Generalissimo Chiang's instructions and the congratulatory telegram from Li Shizeng, the chairman of the standing representative delegation of the League abroad, were read. Generalissimo Chiang's instructions stated:</p>
<p>The purpose of your League is to fight against the tide of aggression, to eliminate the threat and trend of war, and to lay the foundation for true world peace. However, to fight against the tide of aggression, we must not achieve results with gentle weakness and disorganized responses. We must base ourselves on the brave and resolute will of anti-aggressors around the world and use our greatest determination for peace to make active struggles in order to achieve results. All our compatriots across the country believe that our resistance is a concrete and effective action to contain aggression. All peace-loving countries recognize that the success of our country's resistance is the most effective warning to others who attempt to undermine world peace. If we unite to contain Japan's violent ambitions, then the work of defeating aggressors and avoiding the world's re-involvement in war will be completed sooner. Our resistance is not only for ourselves, but also for the world. The enthusiasm and heroism we have shown in the resistance is enough to encourage anti-aggressors around the world to ××× with us, inflict fatal blows on aggressors, and realize the goal of world peace.</p>
<p>After the reading, representatives of various agencies gave speeches in succession. Then, proposals and the conference declaration were discussed, and Ding Weifen, Zi Zuoren, and other 101 people were elected as honorary chairmen of the second session.

<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] It has now been officially confirmed that Britain has agreed to form a defensive military alliance with the Soviet Union. The deadlock that has hampered the progress of the European peace front for two months has been broken. France will be one of the allied nations, and Turkey will also join. After making this decision, Britain will allow the Soviet Union to join the alliance under the following conditions: (1) An Anglo-French-Soviet treaty shall be established based on complete reciprocity, whereby if any of the three countries is attacked, the other two countries shall immediately provide assistance. (2) The three countries shall no longer declare guarantees to other countries, but agree that if any other country resists aggression with all its might and requests assistance, the three countries shall immediately provide full assistance with all their strength.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 22nd] Halifax met with Maisky twice yesterday. Bonnet also separately visited Halifax and Maisky this morning. All newspaper diplomatic correspondents agree that there has been progress in the Anglo-Soviet talks, but as of now, no definitive decision has been made. Some newspapers say that nothing will be announced until the British Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. It is said that Bonnet has offered a compromise proposal including key points from both Britain and the Soviet Union. Under the current circumstances, the Baltic states may not be guaranteed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 21st] British Foreign Secretary Halifax held a three-hour talk with French Prime Minister Daladier and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris last night. This morning, he met with the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, here. The two had an hour and a half talk, which was very sincere. It is known that Maisky came to Geneva yesterday afternoon, and when passing through Paris, he paid a visit to French Prime Minister Daladier. British Foreign Secretary Halifax is also meeting here with the League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, Burckhardt, and had tea with the League of Nations Secretary-General, Avenol. He plans to meet with Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler tonight. After Halifax and Maisky met, they each reported to their respective governments. There will probably be no further developments at this time, and we must wait until the British Cabinet meeting on the 24th, as Halifax will return to London on the 23rd to attend the Cabinet meeting. All parties are paying extremely careful attention to the current situation. Apart from a generally improved atmosphere, all other information must be carefully studied.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 22nd] This morning, London newspapers still made the most optimistic criticisms of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations currently underway in Geneva. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that it is almost bizarre that an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union has not yet been reached. However, the final decision may have to be made at the Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, after Halifax rushes back to attend. Furthermore, the "Daily Express," which has always opposed an Anglo-Soviet agreement, published an article today stating, "Unfortunately, since Britain promised to guarantee the security of Central Europe, the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet agreement is a natural result."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] French Foreign Minister Bonnet said in a speech in Arras today that France's desire for peace has never changed. "The suffering from the absence of peace is enough to diminish human dignity and happiness. We believe that force cannot rule Europe." Bonnet emphasized that other countries are gradually agreeing with France's viewpoint, and said, "France has agreed with Britain to complete the guarantee system, and is negotiating with the Soviet Union and Turkey to seek peace.

<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 21st] Polish Becker customs officers were attacked by Nazi stormtroopers yesterday and resisted behind closed doors. The Polish Commissioner in Danzig has lodged a strong protest with the Senate. These customs officers were rescued by Danzig police today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 21st] It is reported that at 5 pm today, Nazi stormtroopers attacked the Polish Customs in Becker. According to the latest reports, the Polish customs supervisors resisted behind closed doors and requested assistance by telephone. It is heard that these stormtroopers had gathered in Danzig before the event. The Polish administrator has notified the Danzig Senate tonight, saying that the Polish government demands that the Senate immediately take necessary measures to restore the freedom of Polish officials in Becker. Polish sources say that today's German attack on the Polish Customs at Kassow, on the border of East Prussia, is a provocative act. However, it has not yet been determined whether the initiator was the Danzig Senate, the local Nazi Party, or Germany. It is reported that the five Nazi members who attacked the vehicle of the Polish Deputy Administrator came from Marienburg in East Prussia. According to a telegram from Berlin, Danzig Nazi leader Greiser has submitted a memorandum to the Polish Minister, demanding compensation for the Kassow incident, saying that when the Danzig Deputy Administrator sent by the Polish government to investigate arrived at the scene, the anti-Polish demonstrations had already stopped, and the innocent Danzig citizen Grubele was hit and killed by the headlights of the Deputy Administrator's car when he returned from Marienburg and exited the gate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 21st] Regarding the anti-Polish incident that occurred in Kassow, Danzig, the Polish High Commissioner in Danzig, Chodacki, recently protested to the Chairman of the City Council, Greiser, stating that the municipal authorities had recently provided guarantees that they would take necessary measures to ensure the safety of Polish personnel so that they could freely perform their duties. However, this guarantee has not been fulfilled, indicating that the city authorities are unwilling or unable to maintain order, and should be held responsible for the Kassow incident. In short, the rights that Poland retains in Danzig in terms of taxation cannot be restricted by fait accompli. Therefore, three demands are made: (1) The municipal authorities should investigate the circumstances of the Kassow incident, obtain results, and notify Poland. (2) Polish customs officers should be compensated for damages. (3) Since Polish citizens and civil servants are frequently attacked, the municipal authorities should clearly and resolutely state to the Polish government whether they can maintain order and protect the safety of Polish personnel.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 22nd] A citizen of Danzig, named Gdny Buler, was shot and killed by a Polish coachman for no reason on the 20th. According to the official statement issued by the Danzig municipal authorities, Buler hired a cab that evening to go to Danzig. Suddenly, a car with Polish license plate number VI-61.306 violated the road traffic rules and shone extremely bright headlights on it. Grubele was forced to stop the car, and the coachman, Hopo, got out of the car to inquire. Unexpectedly, the people in the car with the Polish license plate started shooting without saying a word. His head and chest were injured. Then, the coachman Pu and two other passengers went to the German-Polish border, Bert Hoff, and brought back the local police with medicine to the scene of the incident, only to learn that a car head that drove out of the Polish border Baosichao station has brought the killers away.</p>
<p>As for the tax decision on the Polish vehicle, it has been temporarily postponed. According to official confirmation, one was Pankowski, the secretary of the Polish Legation, one was Dr. Schuler (both are Polish diplomatic representatives stationed in Danzig), one was Wei Tai, the chief inspector of the customs, and one was a coachman whose true name has not yet been verified. After this incident occurred, Greiser, the Speaker of the Danzig Senate, immediately invited the Polish Minister to Danzig, Chodacki, to come and protested in the name of the Free City of Danzig. The protest "opposed in the strongest terms the perverse acts of Polish officials who enjoy extraterritoriality within the territory of Danzig, and demanded that Poland immediately investigate the truth of the case and implement compensation."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 22nd] According to the official announcement released yesterday afternoon, Grubele, who was tragically murdered on the evening of the 22nd, was shot in the back. In the Polish "murder" car that caused the incident, two Polish military pistols and one Mauser pistol were found. According to police investigation, one of the aforementioned military pistols had been recently fired. It is also particularly noteworthy that after the incident, a locomotive carried the murderers to the Baosichao station in Poland, and the driver was a Polish employee of the Kassow station in Danzig.</p>
<p>Polish Statement</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 26th] Yesterday afternoon, the Polish side issued an article to defend the Kassow incident. The article mentions the shooting incident on the evening of the 20th, saying, "On Saturday, a Polish customs officer in Kassow was suddenly attacked by a crowd and retreated into Polish territory. The Polish diplomatic representative stationed in Danzig planned to send two officials to Kassow to request protection from the local police, but was refused. The two then went to Bu Suofu alone and were threatened by the crowd. For self-defense, the coachman fired a shot into the sky as a warning, but it was still ineffective. The crowd was fired upon once more. As for how it started and what the results were, Warsaw of the Polish army has not yet learned of it. The Polish government has lodged a serious protest with Danzig."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] A book about future wars has recently been published here for the public to read. It states that if a fascist invasion occurs, the Soviet Union should be loyal to its obligations and never abandon democratic countries. The book describes a hypothetical war in which Germany attacks France and Soviet Russia. The "Pravda" newspaper gave a three-column review of it, calling it "the most realistic and reasonable" work. The book describes the Soviet Russian Air Force rejecting the German Air Force's attack and flying to bomb the bases of the German Air Force, destroying the German Air Force. As a result of the defeat, a revolution occurred in Germany, and France was reorganized into a People's Front government.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Canada Participates in the War: Memorial Tower Unveiled; British King Attends and Delivers a Speech: Peace and Freedom are Inseparable <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 21st] This morning, a ceremony was held here to unveil the memorial tower for participation in the war. The British King delivered a speech, with the famous line: "There is no lasting peace without freedom, and no lasting freedom without peace." The British King said that we should pay attention to the symbolic meaning of the memorial tower: "The archway through which the national army passed is engraved with images of peace and freedom. This is not a mere juxtaposition, because peace and freedom are inseparable. It is a great event that one of the world's major capitals (referring to Ottawa) has this memorial tower to commemorate the great truth." The British King also said, "The memorial tower reminds me of Canada's contributions in the last Great War. Fortunately, my work has been largely completed. The exquisite artwork I unveiled (referring to the memorial tower) will surely vividly express the spirit of Canada forever. This memorial tower is enough to show the world the heart of Canada and is the best symbol, which is appropriately called 'Response.' When world peace was disrupted and human freedom was endangered in the last World War, the world expected Canada's answer, and Canada sacrificed 60,000 lives for this, and the number of those who were injured in their hearts was even greater. This memorial tower is indeed a good word to future times and all countries in the world." When the British King spoke, his words were clear, and a large crowd made statements at the memorial. The British King arrived at 11 am, and the crowd cheered incessantly. A guard of honor, dressed neatly, surrounded the memorial tower, holding military flags fourteen feet high, which was very spectacular. The crowd sang hymns, and then the British King and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie presented wreaths and placed them next to the memorial tower. The British King walked around at will for about half an hour, and the couple were wildly cheered by the crowd before leaving. The memorial tower is built of granite and is worth 200,000 pounds. The location is excellent, facing the newly expanded Elgin Street, with the beautiful Laurentian Mountains as the background. A total of 200,000 people participated in this memorial tower event. The British King and his wife contacted Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose by long-distance telephone this morning, and left here for Kingston at 6:36 pm (Greenwich Mean Time).</p>
<h3 id="e24">German-Italian Military Alliance Signed Yesterday Morning; Permanent Committee Organized Simultaneously; Wartime Economic Cooperation to Be Carried Out <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The German-Italian military alliance was formally signed here this morning by Ribbentrop and Ciano. The alliance treaty stipulates three points: (1) Both parties need to maintain mutual contact forever in order to obtain common opinions on disputes concerning the interests of both parties and the European situation. (2) If the common interests of one party are jeopardized due to international developments, both parties must immediately conduct consultations to decide on steps to be taken to protect the interests of both parties. (3) If the security and major interests of one party are threatened, the other party should do its best to provide assistance politically and diplomatically. If one party is at war or in dispute with Germany, the other party should provide assistance with all its naval, land, and air forces. The annex to the agreement stipulates that Germany and Italy will further expand cooperation between the two countries in military activities and wartime economy. The two countries will organize a permanent committee to receive instructions from the two foreign ministers to determine the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the agreement. Once a war occurs, both parties must fully agree before peace can be negotiated. The relations of the friendly countries of the two alliances, such as Japan, "Manchukuo," and Hungary, are highly valued. The term of this treaty is ten years.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Berlin today. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally went to the station. Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, and military and political dignitaries also arrived at the station to welcome him. The signing of the agreement will take place tomorrow at 11 am in the Ambassador's Office of the New Reich Chancellery. It is expected that Hitler will not participate for a while, but Ribbentrop will guide Ciano to meet Hitler in his personal office after the signing. At that time, Ciano will hand over a personal letter from Mussolini to Hitler. The German and Italian foreign ministers will make short speeches after the agreement is signed, which will be broadcast by radio stations in both countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st] Hitler received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon and held talks. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. A press release was issued afterwards, only saying that the talks lasted a long time, and nothing else was mentioned. In addition, Hitler also received Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys and held discussions. Ribbentrop and Lithuanian Ambassador to Germany, Škirpa, were also present.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] The Foreign Ministry spokesman met with journalists today and remained silent on the inquiry regarding the "basic decision" of the Cabinet to decide whether Japan would participate in the German-Italian military alliance. He could not make any statement. The spokesman also refused to answer whether the Japanese government had notified any other governments of its "fixed policy," only saying that the Japanese government is closely watching the situation in Europe. General observers believe that Japan is currently unwilling to participate in the German-Italian military alliance, but agrees to amend the Anti-Comintern Pact to express Japan's sympathy for the policies of Germany and Italy.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 21st] The League of Nations' tripartite committee of Britain, France and Sweden has decided that under the current tense situation, the status of Danzig will not be changed and will remain under the protection of the League of Nations. Therefore, in theory, the League of Nations is still the protector of Danzig. However, the High Commissioner for Danzig has not returned to his post since reporting to the League of Nations in February.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Promoting the Anti-Aggression Movement <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The International Anti-Aggression Movement Conference Branch met on the 21st. Chairman Chiang's speech aimed to promote the international anti-aggression movement and expand the international movement to aid China and sanction Japan.</p>
<p>Here, we must especially recognize that the current international situation is very conducive to our promotion of this anti-aggression movement. The second is because democratic countries all over the world and the vast majority of people who love democracy and peace have deeply felt the threat of fascist aggressors; the second is because of the success of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy diplomacy and anti-aggression movement, and the progress of the movement for Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States to establish an anti-aggression front; the third is China's struggle to resist Japan and save the country, which has been bravely supported for more than twenty-two months, and is becoming more and more enthusiastic. It is recognized by the world as the main force of anti-aggression, and at the same time it shows the world: the fascist aggressors who have been rampant for a lifetime can be defeated!</p>
<p>Under this favorable situation, we must follow Chairman Chiang's guidance, step up national diplomatic activities, launch a domestic and overseas Chinese public opinion mobilization and other propaganda mobilizations, and promote the international anti-aggression movement. In particular, we must strive to publicize the disasters caused by Japan × in China to Chinese civilians, to world peace, and to human culture, strive to publicize the unity and heroic resistance of all ethnic groups and parties in China and even all the people, and strive to publicize that unifying and developing the international anti-aggression movement and aiding China and sanctioning Japan is the common task of today's world justice and peace people. At the same time, in order to achieve these tasks, we must also redouble our efforts to clean up all remarks and actions that oppose the war and build the country, and clean up all remarks and actions that undermine unity, resistance to war, and the international anti-aggression front.</p>
<h3 id="e27">First Sound of Municipal Improvement <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>In order to make Hong Kong an important city in the world, the local authorities have recently planned to improve it. Today's newspaper reported that the first step will be to demarcate industrial zones in Hong Kong and Kowloon, that is, factories originally located in commercial or residential areas will be ordered to move to areas such as King's Road, Cheung Sha Wan Road, or Ma Tau Wai Road starting from January 1 of next year.</p>
<p>This plan is not only the first sound of municipal improvement, but also can be said to be one of the benevolent policies to improve social security and protect people's lives at this time of increasing population and flourishing industry. However, when advising relocation, we should also pay attention to two points: First, to minimize the difficulties of industrial operators as much as possible, and to provide considerable and necessary convenience and protection when they withdraw from the old site and move to the new site. Second, for designated industrial areas, any factory should be differentiated according to its nature in order to ensure the safety and convenience between them. At the same time, each factory or factory unit should have considerable and necessary sanitary equipment, air defense equipment, sports equipment, and even cultural equipment to promote the morality and knowledge of workers. This is not only to protect the reasonable life of workers, but also to protect social tranquility and protect the lives of citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e28">A Meeting With the Deposed German Emperor, Continued Conclusion <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— J. V Kurenberg Wang Zhong'e</p>
<p>What made the visit very surprising was the German Emperor's alertness and strength. His face was extremely moving. When he spoke of the many books that recorded the German Emperor, only a few authors could understand him. There was a trace of mockery on his face, and his tone was satirical.</p>
<p>Talking is energetic and eloquent, and it is impossible to stop him. The reporter wanted to switch to another topic in a meeting - my chance came just right, the German Emperor was eating jam and bread himself - but he smiled at me and continued to talk! He never forgets a date or a name.</p>
<p>Their conversations are frank and sometimes mixed with slang, but they only talk about their own era, and never about things after November 1918.</p>
<p>These are his living conditions, which are very upright, and he never thinks about speculation or conspiracy rebellion. Gentle in character, with the joy of old age. He can often be seen being interfered with, and there is an old and solid look in his eyes, examining himself and maintaining a peaceful temper.</p>
<p>He spoke with warm love about the people who were loyal and sympathetic to his exile life, as well as his friends. Speaking of England, he was very happy. The German Emperor felt that he was half English. He loves the life of British relatives and imitates them with his own retirement. But he feels that there is often a feeling of resistance in his heart.</p>
<p>The German Emperor gets up every morning between 8:00 and 9:00. After breakfast, he walks in the garden for a while. When walking in the village, he first informs the police, so they follow him very carefully. In fact, there is no need for special protection. He is very popular with the villagers.</p>
<p>Logging is a thing of the past. He now likes gardening and taking care of roses. He often drives out to the countryside or goes to the North Coast to see friends and drink tea. And he often receives a lot of mail.</p>
<p>Therefore, after lunch, he goes to the study to end the day's work. He often invites the "work community" of Doorn: his friends archaeologists. After buying Corfn Island in 1903, antiquities became a beloved hobby. In twenty years of exile, he has completed his "events," and antiquities have indeed become his greatest love. He feels that it is very pleasant to be with scientists, and he only invites scientists.</p>
<p>These are the impressions of an exiled monarch. In short, he has the joyful tendencies of old age, a great interest in discussing ancient culture, and many thriving flowers in his simple Doorn residence.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Can Europe Avoid the Scourge of War? Views of Foreign Residents in Shanghai <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] The majority of foreign residents in this port do not believe that a major European war is imminent. At least one French person believes that war is inevitable sooner or later, and one Italian person believes that the likelihood of war is greater than the likelihood of it not happening. However, one German person believes that all issues can ultimately find a peaceful resolution. Those few who do not believe that war is coming generally believe that hope may be the mother of thought. But the American community is certain that the United States will not participate in the war. As the European crisis becomes increasingly urgent, this reporter has sought the opinions of residents of several countries most closely related to the European situation and compiled them below. I believe this will be welcomed by those concerned about the current situation.</p>
<p>Germany Wishes to Live in Peace with France</p>
<p>Dr. William, a German lawyer, said, "I do not believe that war is imminent. Germany has a leader who is committed to peace and will not resort to force. I recently traveled to Europe and found that only Germany does not discuss war. People in other countries say that Germany does not trust the opinions expressed in the newspapers of various countries. Such statements are extremely ignorant. You should know that Germany is not like that. Germany has always wanted to live in peace with its neighbors. Leader Hitler recently made a special statement that Germany wants to live in peace with France. Germany is not shaken by the British newspapers' constant talk of war. Germany does not want any British territory. I think the Polish issue has the possibility of a peaceful resolution. I believe that Poland and other countries can understand that it is unreasonable for Germany to be separated by a corridor belonging to another country without providing Germany with convenient transportation. In a recent speech, the Leader stated that the National Socialist Party Congress in September of this year would be called the 'Peace Congress.' This point is worthy of attention."</p>
<p>The Situation in Italy Is Different Now Than Before</p>
<p>Mr. Richini, an Italian from the Sino-Italian Shipping Company, said, "There are two opportunities to prevent a European war: (1) the so-called democratic front and the Axis powers can reconcile; (2) the democratic front is powerful enough to intimidate Berlin and Rome. However, the latter is unlikely to succeed. Germany and Italy will fight for their rights. Italy has not forgotten what it was given by Britain and France after the last European war when negotiating peace. Britain and France took everything, while Italy got nothing. A hungry man will not be picky about food and must get it urgently. One thing is certain now: Germany and Italy will never be satisfied with what they have now. The Italian people are now being indoctrinated daily to believe that Italy's national power is strong. The authorities pay little attention to the lack of parties and money, nor do they pay attention to the fact that in the new era of war, economics is more important than weapons. The current situation is certainly far worse than in 1935 when the British fleet entered the Mediterranean to confront the Italian fleet. The Italian fleet's ammunition was only enough for six hours of combat. Now, Italy's army and navy are fully stocked with ammunition."</p>
<p>Japanese Impressions Focus on Britain</p>
<p>Mr. Sbibata, a reporter for the Domei News Agency, said, "I think there is a 50/50 chance of a European war happening or not. Britain has many concerns about war. One is that if a European war breaks out, Japan will take the opportunity to seize British interests in the Far East. Secondly, Britain wants to maintain the balance of power and the current situation, and wants to determine what the results of the German, Italian, and Japanese anti-Comintern pact will be in order to speak out, so at least for now, it will not launch an attack. In short, Britain is currently adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Most of its attention is undoubtedly focused on the possibility of Britain acting as a mediator to achieve peace between China and Japan, as this move would place Japan in an unfavorable position to participate in the European war on a large scale. Britain believes that in this way, it can proceed to build a democratic front. The overall situation is subtle and who dares to decide whether a European war will happen or not? Any event can affect the balance of power."</p>
<p>French Businessman Observes that War Is Inevitable</p>
<p>The import manager of a certain trading house in Paris said, "In my view, a European war is inevitable. It may happen in the near future, or it may happen some time from now, or it may even happen tomorrow, but I am sure it will eventually happen. I think all negotiations will not only fail to cure the disease but will also worsen it. The only hope lies in the democratic front being stronger than the Berlin-Rome Axis, but even so, it may not be able to eliminate the scourge of war. A letter from my Paris headquarters said that although war may not happen immediately, precautions must be taken. Therefore, orders for goods sold to China that require immediate delivery can still be accepted by France, while orders for delivery in the distant future must be rejected to prevent war, port blockades, or ships being sunk and goods being confiscated. Since the summer of 1914, Europe has never been more worried about the scourge of war than it is today. When the Czech crisis occurred last September, my trading house still accepted long-term orders, taking risks, but today it does not dare to. This has greatly damaged businesses that ship goods from Europe to Shanghai for sale. Since Chinese factories have been destroyed by artillery fire, sales of imported textiles have increased sharply. It would be great if we could accept long-term orders."</p>
<p>Democratic Countries Can Eliminate European War</p>
<p>A British stockbroker who recently traveled to Europe and returned to Shanghai said, "I think the sudden strengthening of the attitude of the democratic countries can largely eliminate the European war. Today, gunpowder is scattered all over Europe, and a single spark can easily start a prairie fire. But I think Hitler and Mussolini now both need security matches and intend to continue to take this precaution. They would rather engage in negotiations than risk failure, which would result in the loss of everything they have today. I think that since Germany has signed an agreement with Romania, it can obtain the benefits it would have obtained by recovering its old colonies, such as oil and wheat, which can be obtained at will without having to pay transportation costs and maintain maritime navigation. The tension in Europe cannot be eased for a while, but I believe that war will not happen."</p>
<p>Italian Wisdom Will Not Seek War</p>
<p>Mr. Ross, the Secretary of the YMCA of the American Navy, said, "In my personal opinion, there will be no war in Europe. European politicians today all know the meaning of war, especially Mussolini. Mr. Mussolini is extremely intelligent and patriotic and will never allow Italy to be destroyed. I served in the Italian YMCA for a long time during the last European war and gained a lot of experience. I know Mr. Mussolini very well, but I know very little about Hitler. However, I think Hitler would be powerless without Mussolini's help. Mussolini makes good use of his wisdom and is admired even by his enemies. I believe that Mussolini must know that if a major war breaks out, he will lose his power and destroy his achievements. Italy's financial resources cannot engage in a major war. Italy may be forced to be drawn into the whirlpool of war, like Austria in the last European war, but I personally do not believe that Italy will do this. I believe that Mussolini, because of his familiarity with economics and his love for his country, will never sign a declaration of war against Britain and France. He will find another way out, just like he did in Munich."</p>

<h3 id="e30">First Sound of Municipal Government Improvement: Hong Kong Government Designates Industrial Zones in Hong Kong and Kowloon; Locations are King's Road, Cheung Sha Wan Road, or Ma Tau Kok; All Factories in Other Areas Must Relocate Starting Next Year <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the number of residents in Hong Kong has increased sharply, and industrial plants in the mainland have also relocated to Hong Kong to survive, so the population density in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon has increased suddenly, leaving almost no vacant land. However, Hong Kong is a commercial port, and mixing factories in between not only tarnishes the city's appearance but also has a significant impact on the health and well-being of residents. Therefore, the Hong Kong authorities have drafted the 1939 Urban Design Ordinance and appointed multiple committee members and experts to manage the affairs of the Urban Design Improvement Committee. Once the ordinance is implemented, the first step will be to designate each district in the city as a residential area, an industrial area, or a commercial area. Currently, the industrial areas have been designated as King's Road on Hong Kong Island and Cheung Sha Wan Road or Ma Tau Kok in Kowloon. These areas have fewer residential buildings, and some factories have already been established there. The current priority of the government authorities is to relocate all factories mixed in with commercial or residential areas to avoid affecting the health and well-being of residents. It is understood that the authorities have decided to implement the above plan, starting from January 1, 1940. All factories originally established in residential or commercial areas must relocate in accordance with the order starting from January 1 next year and must not delay. Those who violate the order will be ordered to suspend operations. Currently, factories are paying close attention to this and have already sent people to survey the above locations to avoid being caught off guard when the time comes.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Water Storage in Hong Kong and Kowloon Breaks Records; Water Released All Day Starting Today; Water Storage in Reservoirs Reaches 4.5 Billion Gallons; Silver Jubilee Reservoir Water Transported to Hong Kong Now Has New Pipes <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>This year's rainfall in April broke the previous record for the same period. The Water Department immediately extended the daily drinking water supply time from eight hours to ten hours. In the past three days, continuous heavy rain has further increased the water storage in the reservoirs of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Therefore, the Water Department officially announced yesterday afternoon that it had decided to resume the full-day supply of drinking water from today onwards, without any restrictions. The reporter received semi-official news the day before yesterday and published that the Water Department planned to implement the full-day water supply on Monday of last week. However, the implementation of a law requires certain procedures to be followed, so it was delayed until today. As for whether this full-day water supply method will change this year, it is still unknown and depends on whether the rainfall is sufficient in the next three months of the rainy season.</p>
<p>Water Storage in Hong Kong and Kowloon Reservoirs Increases Sharply</p>
<p>In the past three days, the amount of water obtained by the reservoirs in Hong Kong and Kowloon totaled 998,000,000 gallons. As of 6 a.m. yesterday, the amount of water increased in the reservoirs on Hong Kong Island within 72 hours ranged from 7.84 inches to 10 inches, and the amount of water increased in the reservoirs in Kowloon ranged from 9.1 inches to 13.1 inches. On May 12, the amount of water stored in the reservoirs on Hong Kong Island was 1,866,000,000 gallons, which increased to 2,296,000,000 gallons as of yesterday morning, an increase of 426,000,000 gallons. On May 12, the amount of water stored in the reservoirs in Kowloon was 1,657,000,000 gallons, which has now increased to 2,229,000,000 gallons, an increase of 572,000,000 gallons. Currently, the total amount of drinking water stored in the reservoirs of Hong Kong and Kowloon is 4,521,000,000 gallons, which is the highest record of water storage in the history of Hong Kong. This is due to the Silver Jubilee Reservoir's ability to store a large amount of drinking water. Before the reservoir was completed, the maximum amount of drinking water that could be stored in the reservoirs of Hong Kong and Kowloon was only 3,000,000,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Highest Water Storage Record in More Than Ten Years</p>
<p>In the past three days, a total of 11 inches of water has been obtained, and the amount of water obtained in May has reached 16.85 inches, the highest record since 1928. The amount of water obtained in May of that year was 18.41 inches. The highest record of water obtained in May was 25.445 inches in 1927. There is a great possibility that this year's May water record will break the highest record. The amount of water obtained this month is already about 5 inches higher than the average. Since January, a total of 25.445 inches of water has been obtained, about 15 inches higher than the average. The time with the most water obtained in the past three days was yesterday (22nd) morning, from 5:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., with a total of 2.74 inches of water. From 10 a.m. on Friday to 10 a.m. on Saturday, 2.75 inches of water was obtained. From 10 a.m. on Saturday to 10 a.m. on Sunday, a total of 2.965 inches of water was obtained. From 10 a.m. on Sunday to 10 a.m. yesterday (Monday), a total of 5.76 inches of water was obtained. In three days, a total of 11.5 inches of water was obtained, which is equal to the average amount of water in May. The pipes used to transport water from the Silver Jubilee Reservoir to Hong Kong have now been replaced with new pipes. The pipes are capable of transporting a large amount of drinking water and are placed on the seabed between Hong Kong and Kowloon. They will be completed soon. When they are put into use in the future, the water supply in Hong Kong will be temporarily suspended within a certain period of time each day. The Water Department will announce the date in a few days so that residents can be prepared.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Betrand Speaks on the Latest International Situation at a Welcome Meeting in the Cultural Community <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Democratic countries are uniting in development, and we must do our best to promote it!</p>
<p>The universe after the rain is clear and bright. Running outside from the depressing small room was originally the intention, not to mention this is a rare gathering—not only can you meet friends, but you can also listen to the speech of an international friend who has come from thousands of miles away. So, on Conduit Road and Bonham Road, there were many cultural figures from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Mr. Betrand, a famous reporter for the Manchester Guardian in the United Kingdom, was assigned to come to China via Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association and the Hong Kong Liaison Office of the Literary and Art Association held a meeting to welcome him at the St. John's Hall on Bonham Road at 4 p.m. yesterday and invited Mr. Betrand to speak on "The Latest International Situation." Mr. Betrand is a famous British reporter who expresses great sympathy for China's war of resistance. He personally inspected the front lines of Shanxi last winter and wrote books such as "The Front Line of North China" and "The New Life of China." More than 100 people from the cultural community in Hong Kong attended the meeting yesterday. It was really a full house. After Mr. Xu Dihans speech of welcome, the young and amiable Mr. Betrand began his lively speech, which was translated by Mr. Luo Yinpu.</p>
<p>Mr. Betrand said that in the year since he left Hong Kong, he spent half a year in London and half a year in New York. He was very happy to see the progressive China in the midst of the struggle again and to see all his dear friends. Before he began to talk about the main topic, he first explained his position: he did not represent any country or any government, but was a true friend of the Chinese people. He said that in Europe and the United States, the opinions of the general public on this issue are largely the same, so what he is saying now represents the words of most foreigners. Then, he turned to the main topic in a very organized manner:</p>
<p>There are two possible policies in the international arena: the first is "collective security"; the second is "the balance of power." The United Kingdom, the United States, and France often vacillate between the two. The collective security system was once highly praised, but it was finally destroyed by Japan in 1931. The serious problems that followed, such as the Abyssinian problem, the Spanish problem, the Czech problem, and other tragedies, were tantamount to giving a serious blow to "collective security."</p>
<p>The opposite of collective security is Chamberlainism - realism. This is what caused it. Under the rule of the Conservative Party oligarchy, Chamberlains fundamental attempt was to compromise with Germany and Italy, and then win over France to form a four-power alliance of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, so as to squeeze out the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Why do the British people oppose Chamberlain, but Chamberlain's regime has continued to this day? This should be studied from the relationship between the United Kingdom and France. Originally, the United Kingdom and France had counteracting forces that were mutually restraining each other. At the most tense time of the Czech problem, Germany occupied the Sudetenland, but he wanted him to do it slowly and quietly, without publicizing it. Hitler was unwilling to wait and publicized it in a hurry.</p>
<p>Today, the newspaper reported that the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will form a new agreement. If this is true, there will be two possibilities: one is that Chamberlain's regime will continue; the United States may also be able to join the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union to re-implement "collective security." Although this is considered too late, it can still be salvaged. If this situation continues to develop, it will undoubtedly increase the power of democratic countries to help China, deepen Japan's difficulties, and the final victory of China's war of resistance can be brought forward by two years or one year.</p>
<p>The recent unanimous action of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on the Gulangyu incident is also a symbol of this trend. Chamberlains transformation. In addition to hoping that the government will unite, China must also unite the people and expand the anti-aggression movement.</p>
<p>—A burst of warm applause thanked the international friend for his instructions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, you can raise them for discussion, —Mr. Xu Dihans hope to liven up the atmosphere of the meeting. Mr. Qiao Mu immediately stood up;</p>
<p>" is not easy to achieve," Mr. Betrand said, "The situation is different now than before." "If the development of the new situation is successful, will Japan join the German-Italian front?" Mr. Betrand said this to Mr. Si Mu: "Japan may have two possibilities: one is to dismantle the union of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the other is to attack the Soviet Union. Both of these are difficult and will fail."</p>

<p>Continuous torrential rains have eroded soil in various areas, leading to frequent landslide incidents. On the evening of the 21st, a tragic incident occurred in a small house in Chueng Lung Hong, Sai Wan Ho, Shau Kei Wan, where a landslide crushed the structure, resulting in three deaths and two injuries. Just hours after this tragedy, a wall collapse occurred on Kennedy Road, also due to rain erosion. The wall's collapse buried six people alive. Fortunately, rescuers arrived in time, saving their lives. It is reported that the small house opposite 140 Kennedy Road was home to two couples, Zhang De and his wife, Huang Bai and his wife, and another couple, Ling Mei and his wife, totaling six people. Around 7 a.m. yesterday, the wall behind the house collapsed due to days of heavy rain and erosion. The collapsed wall completely buried the house. Residents nearby called the fire department, which dispatched fire trucks and ambulances to the scene. Liu, a resident of 140 Kennedy Road, and his family, along with Dennis, an employee of Tienshan Trading Company, assisted firefighters in the excavation. Soon, all six people inside the house were rescued. Zhang De told reporters, "We were awakened from our sleep by a loud noise. The roof collapsed, and we were trapped inside. Soon, all light was blocked out, and the air was filled with the smell of earth. We could hear digging, and we thought a long time had passed. When we were dug out, we realized we had only been buried for fifteen minutes." Additionally, (1) a large amount of soil collapsed on a side path on Stubbs Road yesterday morning, covering half the path; (2) near Kennedy Road on MacDonnell Road; (3) at the junction of Robinson Road and Arbuthnot Road; (4) on the hillside of Wan Chai East Hospital Road; (5) near 295 Gough Hill Road; and (6) on the hillside of Wong Nai Chung Road, landslides occurred yesterday morning, blocking traffic.

The second floor collapsed, and one Indian resident, who was sleeping there, was unable to escape in time and was trapped under the fallen debris. Residents on the first floor, hearing the noise, panicked and fled, unsure of what was happening. After discovering the collapse, they called the Central Police Station to report the incident. The police station dispatched a fire engine, an emergency response vehicle, and an ambulance, along with a large number of Chinese and British detectives, to investigate. The injured resident received minor surgery and was then allowed to leave. It is reported that the injured resident only suffered a minor injury to his right foot and did not require hospitalization. It is also reported that the second floor of the house was made of wooden planks, so the pressure from the collapse was minimal, and the Indian resident only suffered minor injuries. Otherwise, he would have been buried alive.</p>

<p>Lawahari, a former member of the International Air Force of the Spanish government army, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. In a conversation with reporters, he discussed the Spanish war and his observations, stating, "I firmly believe that the Spanish war is not over. After the German and Italian forces withdraw from Spanish territory, General Franco will face a crisis on all sides. Many of Franco's subordinates are wavering, and the spirit of the Spanish people remains unyielding. Although they are currently subjected to violence, they will eventually rise up, and this force will not be easily suppressed." Regarding the main reason for the Spanish government army's defeat, he said that the food supply lines were blocked by the enemy, leading to a lack of supplies. In terms of defensive fortifications, the defense lines of Madrid are exceptionally strong, comparable to the Maginot Line.</p>

<p>The Tung On and other foreign ships on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route, which had been detained in Guangzhou for seven months, were released after serious negotiations by the British Consul in Guangzhou. Recently, the Chinese side proposed conditions requiring all cargo on the ships to be completely unloaded before being allowed to leave.

The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure from Guangzhou</p>
<p>After the Chinese side proposed the conditions, all ships prepared to unload their cargo. The Guangxi ship sailed to Dien Bridge on the 19th to unload its cargo. However, Jardine Matheson Warehouse refused to unload the cargo because the ship had not obtained a permit from the Chinese authorities. The ship then negotiated with the navy. Several Chinese warships, seeing the ship crossing the police line, inquired about the situation and sent Chinese soldiers to assist. The ship was then able to unload its cargo. On the 20th, it departed from Guangzhou and arrived in Hong Kong at around 5 p.m. This was the Guangxi ship's escape.</p>
<p>News of Other Ships</p>
<p>Regarding the Tung On, Tai Lee, and Tai Ming ships, according to sources, they were still detained at the mouth of the Pearl River yesterday. The Chinese side's condition for allowing the ships to leave empty required inspection. Cargo that could be carried back to Hong Kong would be allowed, while cargo that could not would have to be completely unloaded. Therefore, the ships were delayed and unable to leave as scheduled. It is estimated that they may be able to escape and return to Hong Kong in the next day or two.</p>

<p>Major factories in Kowloon believe that the electricity company's charges are too high. Several days ago, they jointly wrote to the company requesting a reduction in rates. At the time, the company seemed receptive to the idea, but so far, there has been no concrete response. Yesterday, the factories sent another letter requesting a reduction, but there was still no result. It is reported that there are no fewer than twenty factories of considerable scale in Kowloon, with the three or four largest factories paying up to 2,500 yuan per month for electricity. The factories believe that the price of each generator is only over 10,000 yuan, and they can recover the cost in a few months by installing their own generators. Therefore, they have decided to install their own generators and are currently consulting with a British company. However, smaller factories are facing difficulties.</p>

<p>(Qujiang News) The Provincial Party Department believes that the people's power in the province has not been fully utilized during the Anti-Japanese War, and in order to meet military needs, it is now urgent to catch up and carry out various tasks of organizing the masses, training the masses, and leading the masses. All 30 million men, women, and children in Guangdong can be incorporated into the organization's framework, receive the benefits of doctrine, and participate in various departments' Anti-Japanese War and national construction work under the leadership of the Provincial Party Department. Therefore, it has formulated a general plan and implementation measures for mass organization and training work, which will be issued to Party Departments in various counties and cities so that they can follow the same standards for organization and training work and establish the foundation for the mass movement in the birthplace of the revolution. The first step of the plan is to adjust the original civil groups in various regions, improve their organization, and strengthen their work. The second step is to expand the organization of grassroots mass groups and establish various agricultural, industrial, commercial, and student groups at the county, district, and township levels, penetrating into rural areas and organizing the masses from the bottom up. The third step is to expand guidance to the masses, organize wartime work teams, and organize them according to the characteristics of the masses to undertake various wartime service tasks to meet military needs. The fourth step is to universally implement the training of Anti-Japanese War and national construction knowledge and skills, mobilize Party members and intellectuals in various regions, adopt various forms of activity, and conduct training separately. In addition, various social activities, such as assisting in the promotion of military service, relief for disaster victims and refugees, savings campaigns, national economic construction campaigns, and donation campaigns, all have detailed plans and are being promoted step by step. There are also strict plans for the organization and training of the masses in guerrilla areas. The plan will be completed in all parts of the province within a month.</p>

<p>[Suixi Express] Since the invasion of Hainan Island by the enemy, the situation in the Southern Road has become increasingly tense and has entered a state of war. Suixi, one district, is close to the coast, but most of its territory is adjacent to the French Guangzhou Bay, and the terrain is flat. Since the spring of this year, the first district has been instructed by the county government to destroy highways, and has already instructed the township chiefs and deputy chiefs under its jurisdiction to complete the destruction within the prescribed time limit and report it. However, the township chiefs all feel that the terrain is flat and the destruction is not thorough. Now, they have been ordered to thoroughly destroy all highways within the jurisdiction of the district, and the nine townships and towns near Anliang, Xi'an, Nanmu, Donghe, Zhonghe, Xiluo, Zhonghuo, and Beijing have convened the village chiefs separately and urged the people to thoroughly destroy the highways in their respective jurisdictions every day, with more than 300 workers in each village. In addition, the section from Shentang Market in the county to Mao Tengdu Ferry has not yet been destroyed due to manpower constraints. In order to comply with military orders, a destruction team was specially dispatched yesterday to assist with the work and thoroughly destroy the section, while prohibiting vehicles from passing through. In addition, Xuwen, Qinlian, Hepu, and other counties have been ordered by the provincial government to continue to thoroughly destroy highways.</p>

<p>[Qujiang Express] In order to understand the local health facilities and to provide separate guidance, the Provincial Health Department sent Su Liuzhao, Director of the Rescue Section, to inspect areas such as Yingde, Qingyuan, Sihui, and Guangning. He has now completed his mission and returned to the department to report. It is reported that the governments of the various counties are mostly busy with various wartime tasks, and funds, talent, and medicines are insufficient, so they have hardly taken care of health facilities. At the same time, they regard rescue and treatment as the entire health undertaking, because the responsibilities of the health department and the health office system are not very clear, and they have not widely prepared for it. As for various places, private doctors with a good reputation have moved far away for treatment, and pharmacies have raised the prices of medicines. For example, in Qingyuan County, vaccination costs one yuan per time, and Jianlian pills have risen to six cents per pill, and Jianlian injections cost more than ten yuan per time. However, many villagers in Qingyuan are willing to take on rescue work, so there are still enough rescue team members to dispatch. In Sihui City, only Huici Hospital can provide medical treatment and vaccination. The tax police regiment and its four corps regularly dispatch and assist in rescue work. Yingde Pingmin Hospital is currently preparing to reorganize into a health office and also run a hospital. Many local doctors in Guangning County have not been approved to officially practice, and the source of medicines is very small. During the inspection period, Director Su also convened discussion meetings at any time to discuss health issues in each county, and gave detailed instructions on the health offices, county hospitals, rescue teams, schools, health, and the establishment of rescue stations in each county, and the handling of guidance work was still smooth.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Southern Battlefield of the Dong River <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yuan</p>
<p>As for the fighting strength of the people here, it is also not weak. When Wan City and Shi Long fell and the [Japanese] invaders conducted their first mopping-up operation, the people of Da Lang Market, under the leadership of the Model Volunteer Corps, engaged in fierce street fighting with the [Japanese] invaders. More than one hundred armed volunteers struck over a thousand strong [Japanese] invaders. Although they suffered more than ten casualties, the [Japanese] army suffered several times more casualties than us, filling a whole truck to transport back to Wan City. This glorious and heroic resistance made the [Japanese] invaders feel very tricky and difficult. On the other hand, it greatly enhanced the confidence of the people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because they did not receive strong guidance and assistance, this vast civilian armed force could not be organized, and some that had been organized (such as the Model Volunteer Corps) could not continue due to funding and various difficulties.</p>
<p>Even more unfortunately, these great civilian armed forces, lacking proper organization and leadership, are sometimes incited by local bullies and ruffians to engage in armed fighting. Recently, there have been heartbreaking incidents of brutal armed fighting between two clans near Da Sha on the front line, using machine guns against each other.</p>
<p>(4) Hardworking Young Patriotic Soldiers: Although the environment is harsh and difficult, the national salvation work here will not stop because of this. There are still many enthusiastic young men and women scattered in various villages, supporting it arduously. They never give up their fighting positions, go to Hong Kong or other safe places to become refugees. Some even resolutely sever ties with their families because they oppose the shamelessness of their fathers and brothers becoming submissive citizens. Their ambition not only overcomes the oppression and deception of the [Japanese] invaders and traitors but also overcomes the attacks of hunger and disease.</p>
<p>Recently, they have transformed from individual combat to establishing a unified "Dongguan People's National Salvation Work" with the help of military and political authorities. This new force, which has grown up in arduous struggle, will surely set off a huge wave of resistance in Dongguan and shatter the [Japanese] invaders' new conspiracy.</p>
<p>However, we cannot hide the fact that many serious crises and weaknesses still lurk in the southern battlefield of the Dong River. They have caused us a lot of losses and difficulties, and we have missed many favorable opportunities.</p>
<p>(1) The [Japanese] Invaders' Appeasement Policy: Since suffering serious blows in the first phase of the war, the Japanese invaders have switched to a so-called "appeasement" policy. This policy is manifested in Wan City and Shi Long in the following ways: First, temporarily suspending the slaughter policy; second, selling a large number of inferior goods to the people at low prices; third, using traitors to implement enslavement education and deceptive propaganda; and fourth, establishing exchange offices where Japanese military currency can be exchanged for Chinese national currency at any time. Therefore, many backward people are deceived and willingly become submissive citizens.</p>
<p>(2) Activities of Traitor Puppets: For several months, the Japanese invaders in Wan City and Shi Long seemed to be very quiet on the surface, without any aggressive actions. But in fact, their conspiracy is even more vicious than in the past. Although they are adopting a defensive posture militarily, they are actively attacking politically, trying their best to buy and train traitors, and consolidate the organization of the puppet regime. They are also intimidating the people near the [liberated] areas in many ways, coercing them to establish puppet maintenance associations, attempting to gradually narrow the scope of our guerrillas' activities and even eliminate our guerrilla bases.</p>
<p>(3) Deterioration of Military-Civilian Relations: Speaking of the officers themselves, there are also many serious weaknesses. The fighting morale of the middle and lower-level troops is not strong enough, and the atmosphere of prostitution and gambling is more prevalent than in the past. Some newly formed guerrilla units are even more corrupt: issuing fake passes, extorting, robbing, and engaging in private activities like bandits (in fact, a small part of them were originally bandits, so the people are full of complaints, even saying that they are "more miserable than the Japanese soldiers"). Although this is only a small part of corrupt behavior, because they are carrying the banner of the guerrillas, ordinary people with simple minds have an extremely bad impression of the entire unit, giving the [Japanese] invaders and traitors a very good opportunity to sow discord.</p>
<p>(4) Weakness of Administrative Organs: Although we still retain a vast administrative territory in this guerrilla area, because of the difficult environment and the intimidation of [Japanese] invaders and traitors, many village heads and heads of pao-chia dare not take their responsibilities seriously and express their intention to resign. For example, many important laws and decrees of the government cannot be transmitted to the lower levels for implementation, forming a state of anarchy. This is also one of the reasons why traitors are more easily active.</p>
<p>(5) Unclose Relations Between Allied Forces: Because many of the troops here have been transferred from other places, and two units are newly organized armies, there are differences in education and combat capabilities, and there are good and bad military disciplines. Because of this, there are some gaps in everyone's daily relations, and they unintentionally despise each other. This phenomenon often affects the spirit of practical cooperation in combat.</p>
<p>The overall situation of the War of Resistance has entered a more favorable stage. Because of the increasing anti-war movement at home and the widespread development of our guerrillas, the [Japanese] invaders' conspiracy of a quick victory will become more active. Their plan to consolidate the rear and their attempt to attack the southwest and northwest are proceeding simultaneously. Therefore, we must not forget the [Japanese] invaders' conspiracy to open up the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway just because we see that the [Japanese] invaders in Dongguan and Shi Long are temporarily adopting a defensive posture.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters on the south bank of the Dong River, fellow countrymen from Dongbao living abroad, let us urgently mobilize to assist the government army, to overcome the above weaknesses, to support the War of Resistance on the south bank of the Dong River, to crush the [Japanese] invaders' conspiracy to open up the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and to support all forces!</p>
<p>...End...</p>

<h3 id="e56">World's Fair Film Exhibition - For Example, the "Transportation and Traffic" Category is Divided into Political, Educational, and Commercial Categories <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>In the New York World's Fair, which opened on April 30th, film also occupies a considerable military position. However, among the fourteen items exhibited at the conference, it is neither independent nor belongs to the "Entertainment" or "Art" categories, but is included in "Transportation and Traffic." Why put film in "Transportation and Traffic"? This was decided by the conference authorities after deliberation because they believe that film can transmit news and introduce the customs and news of various countries to the audience. Its contribution to transportation and traffic is greater than "Entertainment" or "Art."</p>
<p>This film exhibition is completely free to visit and is divided into three categories according to its nature: political, educational, and commercial.</p>
<p>Among the political films, the most recommended is Cecil B. DeMille's "America in Progress." In addition, the British participated with several documentaries in the name of the Film United Federation. France has the most travel shorts, and the Soviet Union also has several feature films that combine technology and story. Among the smaller countries, Belgium's industrial and landscape shorts (21 in total) are the most worth seeing.</p>
<p>In terms of educational films, MGM, Paramount, RKO, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., Universal, and other film companies have entries. Various states in the United States also have films describing their state's scenery, products, culture, customs, etc., totaling 48 films.</p>
<p>In terms of commercial films, a short film from the world-famous American MacFadden Publishing Company is the most noteworthy. This short film is only four reels long, but it cost a huge sum of US$50,000. Child stars the Maz twins play key roles in the film. The story tells of a company's growing prosperity due to the power of advertising. Of course, the purpose of this film is to attract stores and companies from all over the world to advertise in the company's publications.</p>
<p>There are also two cartoons. One is Walt Disney's "Mickey Mouse Rally," made for the National Biscuit Company. The other is a rubber puppet film made by the American petroleum industry, depicting the importance of petroleum to human life. Because the performers are elastic rubber people, it has opened up a new path for film art. Therefore, in terms of creative value, this cartoon surpasses the "Mickey Mouse Rally."</p>
<p>The fair also set up a film review committee to classify and critique the exhibited films. The winners are awarded medals and certificates.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Shaw's Famous Plays Continuously Appear on the Silver Screen - Clark Gable Will Star with Wendy Hiller in a Film <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>We have already enjoyed Shaw's "Pygmalion." The producer of "Pygmalion," the Hungarian Gabriel Pascal, was originally a friend of Shaw. The film rights to almost all of Shaw's famous plays belong to him. After "Pygmalion," at least the following three plays will continue to be filmed:</p>
<p>(1) The Doctor's Dilemma: This play chronicles an American revolutionary story. Wendy Hiller will still play the female lead. It is said that Wendy Hiller was personally recommended by Shaw to play the flower girl. She has now signed a five-year contract with Pascal, and her position on the silver screen will naturally gradually rise. The male lead belongs to the famous Clark Gable.</p>
<p>(2) The Devil's Disciple: Pascal has long wanted to film this script, but Shaw believed that the play was too intense and might be opposed, so he filmed "Pygmalion" first. It is now scheduled to be filmed after "The Doctor's Dilemma."</p>
<p>(3) Caesar And Cleopatra: This play is a romance set in Roman times. Cecil B. DeMille once filmed a "Cleopatra" based on this story. Of course, in Shaw's script, there are also his own views.</p>
<p>After these films are made, they will all be distributed by MGM.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Hollywood Star Representatives - Continued <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Jack Oakie: Jack is good at playing promoters, but he also played the "Accordion Player" once. "A Parisian Woman" gave a very good impression.</p>
<p>Jimmy Durante: The first thing that comes to mind is his big-nosed pranks, "The Passionate Plumber".</p>
<p>Joe E. Brown: The wide-mouthed star's "Alibi Ike" is the most comical.</p>
<p>Boris Karloff: What left the deepest impression on the audience was "Frankenstein."</p>
<p>Johnny Weissmuller: In "Tarzan and His Mate", his second Tarzan film, there is a most wonderful performance.</p>
<p>James Cagney: "Yankee Doodle Dandy" is of course his representative work.</p>
<p>William Powell: Powell has had few works in recent years. "My Man Godfrey", which he co-starred with Myrna Loy a few years ago, can be considered the most outstanding.</p>
<p>Paul Muni: It can be said that Paul's films are all of high quality. "The Story of Louis Pasteur" was selected as one of the top ten blockbusters last year. It is a pity that it cannot be shown publicly in Shanghai. Comparing "Scarface", "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", "The Life of Emile Zola", and "Juarez", it is agreed that "The Life of Emile Zola" is the most outstanding and refined.</p>

<p>Higgins did not know how to answer. Because, less than twenty feet away, Carpathia was talking to Eliza. He hated that man in his heart, but there was nothing he could do, and he could not get away for a while. When he did get away, Carpathia walked towards him, with a smug look on his face.</p>
<p>"Miss Doolittle is very humorous," he said and walked towards a group of reporters.</p>
<p>A female reporter asked, "Oh, Mr. Carpathia, who is Miss Doolittle?"</p>
<p>"I already know everything about her. She is—" He stopped talking, leaned down to the female reporter's ear, and whispered, "I think she's just a slum girl."</p>
<p>"Are you crazy!" Carpathia said mockingly, "I—Alexi Carpathia, your best student, know she must be a princess!"</p>
<p>Higgins breathed a sigh of relief at this time and calmed down. "Okay! Whatever you say," he said softly.</p>
<p>The next morning, when Mrs. Pearce brought in the tea, she said with a bitter face, "Eliza is gone."</p>
<p>"Gone?" he asked in return, and then woke up. He remembered that she insisted on going home last night.</p>
<p>When they got home from the dance party, although they were grateful that they had not failed, they were very tired.</p>
<p>"Thank God, it's finally over," he had said, yawning. "I can go to sleep in peace. Where are my slippers?"</p>
<p>"Here, here," Eliza threw the slippers over angrily, "You thank God it's over, but what about me? What about me?"</p>
<p>"You won't have any problems," he said worriedly.</p>
<p>Their arguments were not out of their own wishes. Higgins never thought that one day this matter would turn into nothing. But now Eliza is gone. Really gone!</p>
<p>He asked the police to investigate, but they could not find her whereabouts. "What are these police here for?" he angrily scolded the police on the phone.</p>

<h3 id="e61">South China Football Team Painfully Defeats Foreign Sailors Yesterday - Score of 6-0 is a Comfortable Victory <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 5:30 PM, the South China Southern Tour football team played a friendly match against the British Navy's HMS Gannet at Jia Hill. The match was originally scheduled to start at 5:00 PM, but due to the death of a colleague on the ship, the funeral was held in the afternoon, and all the crew members went to participate, causing a delay and postponing the start time.</p>
<p>The South China team was about to set off, but the players had not yet been selected. Team Leader Mo specifically scheduled this match to review the strength of the players as a basis for selection.</p>
<p>Liu Songsheng, who had been retired for a long time, played yesterday, acting as the right inside forward in the first half. His footwork was as good as before, and his dribbling was also agile. He played right midfielder in the second half, but his strength was slightly lacking. When Zhang Jinhai guarded the front line, his skills were mediocre and he did not show his talent, but after Songsheng changed positions, he was able to score two goals in a row, which was very active. Luo Douwenzu played the left wing and worked very hard. The two drawbacks of good dribbling and greed for credit were eliminated one by one, and the passing was also considered passable. Liang Baiwei performed quite well, and his position was also good. Tan Zhenhui had sufficient strength, but his experience seemed to be lacking. The rest of the generals were able to perform at their original level. Center Chen Dehui also stood out.</p>
<p>The foreign sailors focused on defense rather than offense. Old Man Bagu's skills were proficient, and he was able to advance and retreat appropriately. His skills were no less than the minister's. The two inside backs were also very likable. They blocked the South China forwards in the first half, preventing them from having any shooting opportunities, and lost 0-1 first. After about fifteen minutes into the second half, Martin had cramps and left the field and could not play anymore. The South China forwards scored several goals in a row, resulting in a huge score of 6-0. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>After the two armies came into contact, Dehui, Beihua, and Songsheng divided their forces and advanced, and Kansi, Martin, Garia, Guba, and Dan Lister fought head-on.</p>
<p>In the fifth minute, Shuiyi attacked from the side, and Jili Daru blocked the ball out of bounds. South China took a corner kick, but it did not achieve anything. In the eighth minute, Shuiyi made a surprise attack on the side. Dehui also broke in at the same time, and shot fiercely at the attack. Jili Daru bravely扑the ball out. Shuiyi fired again, and Kansi defended and resisted, and the ball went wild.</p>
<p>In the tenth minute, Beihua and Shuiyi went east and west, Dehui crossed into the阵地, and fiercely shot. The ball was as fast as an arrow, and Jili Daru could not save it. 1-0 South China won first.</p>
<p>In the twelfth minute, Dehui came back, and Martin飞身力拒, De煇扫射攻门, and the ball hit the post, bounced out, and Martin力救得免. At the same time, McNerney Yunshi, Phirux, and others launched an attack, but they did not succeed.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth minute, Dehui sent the ball far to Douwen, and then took advantage of the emptiness to break in, approached the goal, and fired a shot, which hit Jili Daru's foot.</p>
<p>In the 21st minute, Douwen越过Martin, Shuiyi invaded at the same time, and shot strongly at the attack. Jili Daru saved quickly, and passed the dangerous pass. Already Shuiyi forced a corner kick, the landing point was适中, Jili Daru拒出门外, Douwen came to fire, and hit the斗柱, as if entering the treasure mountain, and returned empty-handed. The first half ended with the sailors losing 0-1.</p>
<p>After exchanging positions, South China changed the position of Songsheng to defend the center, and Jinhai was transferred to the front line, making the military appearance even more glorious. In the fifth minute, the sailors tried to recover the lost ground, and Somas made a side吊攻门, and Rongcai援救得力化险为夷.</p>
<p>In the tenth minute, the sailors went down in five ways, frequently园攻 South China's阵地. Yi Yunshi suddenly fired a cold arrow, and Rongcai bravely saved the sailors and retreated in frustration.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth minute, Douwen and Dehui rushed into the sailor's阵地, Kansi came to meet them, Dehui's foot head rose, and 2-0 won again.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth minute, Dehui raised troops, and Beihua策应赶来. Guba and Martin failed to effectively resist, and Beihua swept into the net, 3-0.</p>
<p>In the 20th minute, Beihua捲土重来</p>
<p>Jinhai奋身直入, and fell into another city, 4-0,</p>
<p>In the 22nd minute, Douwen傍传, and Jinhai immediately fired at the door, and the ball hit the door post. Only South China's锐气 was盛, and Songsheng intercepted Beihua and passed it to Dehui again, and it did not辱命, and built another achievement, 5-0,</p>
<p>In the 28th minute, Qingcai送一程, Jinhai斗前迎顶, and the ball卽进入网内, 6-0, at this time the sailors tried their best to hold on, and ultimately the general trend had passed and they could not do anything. When the gold was 收军, the sailors were慘败 with 0-6. The阵势 is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e72">Preliminary Floor Exercises <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>The history of floor exercises in our country is still very short. During this short period, it is certainly not easy to make it a common material for physical training throughout the country. However, this kind of exercise has its unique value, especially in today's all-out war of resistance, where physical education must be coordinated with military affairs, its importance is particularly evident. Let me first talk about its value and the matters that should be paid attention to in its implementation:</p>
<p>The movements of floor exercises, such as: rotation, somersault, handstand, somersault, etc., can develop the habit of tumbling and rotating, adapting to the needs of aviation technology, ingenuity, agility, and liveliness, can develop the technology of adapting to changes, adapting to the environment of close combat. It is a true full-body exercise. Between a jump, a leap, a roll, and a somersault, it is particularly beneficial to the stimulation of internal organs and the exercise of the torso. It can cultivate vitality and adapt to the final persistence of the protracted war of resistance. It does not require much equipment. In addition to a few mats, it requires nothing else, which can save money and conserve financial resources for the war of resistance. These are all directly helpful to the war of resistance. As for its lively movements, in addition to building up the body and defending the country, it can also develop the lively nature of the practitioners, especially the rest.</p>
<p>The most exquisite method of making mats is to use cotton wadding with palm fiber skin on both sides as the lining, and to use canvas as the surface. The surface must be sewn firmly every foot or so vertically and horizontally to prevent the cotton wadding and palm fiber skin from shrinking into a ball. If you are a little more careless, you can weave rice straw into a mat, and cover the surface with sackcloth and mats, which is economical. If you are simple, you can weave grass into a cushion, or you can do it on flat ground.</p>
<p>The storage of mats is also a very important issue. The most important thing is not to get wet in the rain, so that it cannot be used next time. After use, the dust must be wiped clean and placed in a high place to avoid contamination, which is detrimental to hygiene during exercise.</p>
<p>Before implementing floor exercises, some preparatory exercises must be done first to warm up the body. The best preparatory exercise is jumping. When doing it, the practitioners can be instructed to run around one side of the mat in a circle, and when they run to the mat, they will do several kinds of jumping exercises in sequence.</p>
<p>Floor exercise is a kind of exercise that combines skill and beauty, not an exercise that uses brute force. Therefore, the movements must be done according to a certain method; at the same time, it requires courage and meticulousness, so the movements cannot be rough and careless. If these two principles are violated, it is often easy to be dangerous.</p>
<p>The movements of floor exercise are done by one person, or by a combination of many people. The difficulty is clearly divided. Anyone can learn step by step, but the advanced and difficult movements require considerable practice. Some preliminary movements are introduced here. It is inevitable to miss something. Please correct me.</p>
<p>Before talking about the movements, I have a small statement that I hope the reader will pay attention to, that is, the following movements have a classifying nature, but it is not a strict classification. The difficulty of the movements is not in the order of the total order. Each category has different levels of difficulty. A movement has several ways to do it, and if the method is the same, or the method of this type of movement is the same as that of another type of movement, it will only be noted in the description, and it will not be listed one by one. Most floor exercises can be done continuously, although not every one is noted, the practitioner must know it.</p>

<h3 id="e73">The So-Called "China and Commerce Bank" and Its Appointment <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Hanhui</p>
<p>The so-called "China Xing Commercial Bank," jointly established by the Nanjing "Reformed Government" and Japanese banks, was established in Shanghai amidst the disastrous fall in the price of "Lian Yin" notes in Tianjin. According to Chen Jintao, the "President" of the bank, and Tsuda of the Xingya Institute Liaison Department, "The bank has a capital of 50 million yen, half from the Japanese and half from the puppets, and will issue 'China Xing' notes with the same value as the legal tender," and "can freely exchange foreign debt." Tsuda also said that "Japanese residents will first use its banknotes." Many people believe that the disastrous fall in the price of "Lian Yin" notes in the north, which wanted to replace the role of the legal tender, has failed. Today, they still want to promote "China Xing" notes in Shanghai and the Jiangnan region, which is very incomprehensible. In fact, this issue is by no means as simple as people generally imagine, and it is worth careful study.</p>
<p>The development process of imperialist economic aggression is from commodity export to capital export. However, the era of capital export does not stop commodity export, but needs to expand its commercial export to increase its capital accumulation. The purpose of capital export is to control the finance and industry of the colony, especially the monetary system of the colony. The so-called US dollar group and pound sterling group are the most successful manifestations of capital export. Because Japan lacks raw materials for heavy industry and its industrial base is built on light industry, the balance of international revenue and expenditure depends entirely on the export of light industry, even the export of semi-finished rural products (such as silk), which is more than the export of capital. Except for some achievements in the three eastern provinces, it cannot compete with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Moreover, its main raw materials for light industry, such as wool and cotton, still need to be imported from abroad. After the "September 18th Incident," the invasion and seizure of the four eastern provinces of China certainly solved its lack of raw materials for heavy industry, but the lack of main raw materials for light industry has not yet been solved. In order to solve this difficulty, there is the specialisation of Inner Mongolia and North China, and the so-called yen group movement jointly organized by Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. However, Japan's operation of the four eastern provinces has exhausted most of its capital, and it has no surplus to realize this conspiracy. Moreover, due to the success of the central government's legal tender policy and the firm support of the North China authorities, the so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and the yen group plan have all failed. After the Japanese army occupied North China, the "United Reserve Bank" established by the "Peiping Provisional Government" issued "Lian Yin" notes. The plan was to fundamentally eliminate the legal tender and make it the only currency in the north, realizing its yen group conspiracy. However, in fact, the power of the legal tender in North China is by no means as fragile as that of Feng Piao. Therefore, the "Lian Yin" notes have been promoted under the force of the Japanese army for more than a year, and are still limited to some Japanese military strongholds, and have not become the only currency in the north. There are many reasons for its failure. Generally speaking,</p>
<p>(1) As a result of Japan's long-term war of aggression against China, public bonds were issued indiscriminately and the currency was inflated. The price of the yen fluctuated, and the price of the "Lian Yin" notes linked to the yen inevitably plummeted.</p>
<p>(2) The legal tender is fully prepared. Recently, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund has been established, and the "black market" in Shanghai is also relatively stable. The people have a consistent belief in it.</p>
<p>(3) The ruling power of the Japanese puppets is still confined to some urban strongholds, and most of the land is still under the rule of the central government.</p>
<p>(4) The silver in the Tianjin concession area has not been robbed successfully, and all foreign banks in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have refused to accept "Lian Yin" notes.</p>
<p>(5) Lian Yin notes have no reserves, and the amount of issuance is very large, resulting in rising prices and plummeting note prices. (The Tianjin market price of counterfeit notes has fallen to only about six jiao of legal tender.</p>
<p>To (6) The recent victory of the central government's military counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Lian Yin" notes are only forcibly circulated in the northern cities occupied by the Japanese army, and once they enter the countryside, they become the world of legal tender, and there is no room for "Lian Yin" notes to circulate. Japan's conspiracy to issue "Lian Yin" notes to replace the legal tender can be said to have failed in the north. However, it has achieved considerable success in using "Lian Yin" to control foreign exchange, restrict import and export trade, and promote the sales of Japanese goods. This can be proved by the sharp increase in imports of Japanese goods and the sharp decrease in imports of goods from European and American countries in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army initially occupied Shanghai and Jiangnan the year before last, it forced the use of some military tickets. Its original intention was that once these military tickets were used in the occupied areas, it would only cost some printing fees to exchange them for huge amounts of agricultural products free of charge to fill its light industry raw materials and food to save its collapsing economic structure.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities; Domestic Economic Environment Changes (Continued); Shanghai's Abnormal Prosperity Is Not To Be Overly Optimistic; Economic Development of Southwest Depends On Transportation Construction <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Economic Conditions</p>
<p>As for the economic situation abroad, under the situation of tense diplomacy and arms race, the phenomenon of recession is also more common. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, the whole year has been in the process of recession. According to the London Economic Magazine's industrial activity index, it has fallen continuously from 111.0 in December last year (1935 as 100) to 100.5 in December this year, a reduction of about 10%. Prices have also fallen, while the number of unemployed workers has increased. The reason is that it was initially affected by the sharp fall in US prices and the stock market, and then foreign trade was increasingly sluggish due to the insecurity of world politics, resulting in the deterioration of the balance of international payments. The position of the pound sterling is particularly weak. In September, due to the Czech issue, the diplomatic crisis was urgent, and the exchange rate between the British and American currencies continued to decline, reaching more than four yuan and six jiao. In the United States, the economic situation in the first half of this year has not improved since the stock market turmoil in the autumn of last year. However, after May, President Roosevelt expanded the budget again and spent a huge amount of relief funds. Due to the increase in market chips, various industries gradually became active, and stock and commodity prices rebounded. At the same time, the inventory of bulk commodities has been greatly reduced since the production cut last year, and domestic and foreign preparations for war are becoming more and more urgent, and the need for military equipment is very high, so industrial production has been stimulated, and export trade can also slightly maintain the level of last year. The situation is better than that of the United Kingdom. In France, prices have continued to rise due to the devaluation of the franc, but the production index has only slightly increased by the end of the year, and the number of unemployed people has not decreased. Moreover, due to the expansion of armaments, the budget deficit has increased day by day. At the end of this year, a new fiscal and economic plan was implemented, extending the working hours of workers to increase production, reducing government expenditures, and improving tax collection in order to balance the budget and strengthen the government's financial organization in order to attract the return of funds. Various economic conditions are in the process of adjustment. As for Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and other countries, under the control of the economy, preparing for war is the only purpose, and various plans are being promoted to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Whether the people's lives are improved or not is no longer the current important issue. Looking at the economic conditions of various countries, although they are not as directly affected by the war as our country, they have lost their normal development due to the war and the war-related relations. They all sacrifice everything to seek the enrichment of military power. From now on, the hope of world peace is almost in danger. This is something that we cannot fail to bear in mind when observing the domestic and foreign environment. (End)</p>

<p>— Zhuli</p>
<p>Without a hometown, letters from home are no longer as nagging as before, and they never mention a word about anything other than family matters: how the place was lost, how it was lost, and how another kind of "organization" is brewing, how it is being ruled.</p>
<p>However, I completely understand the reason for this silence. Letters that can slip from the inspector's hands into the mailbag, written in crooked characters with a long-abandoned writing brush, always say the same things: there can be no new horrors, new threats, and countless new taxes in the area. At the same time, there cannot be no growth of hatred, resistance, sniper cases happening everywhere, and guerrilla warfare rising up. The army that appeared in the posture of conquerors could not but bribe on the one hand and suppress on the other. A local gentry who once ran rampant with dozens of old Mauser pistols from the bandit era is now actually a prominent ruling class or represents the ruling class with a ferocious face; and a peaceful village may be burned down and become ruins because it is located on the retreat route of the guerrillas, or for no reason at all.</p>
<p>These are the expected disasters. But every time I finished reading the letter from home, I was at a loss. What I got was not what I had prepared for. Is this believable, everything in my hometown is still the same, the killing has stopped, and I can still live peacefully as before, is this also believable, the place is quiet, people are rearranging their lives and careers under the rule of the conquerors, without hatred, and without guerrilla warfare?</p>
<p>It cannot be like this. In the past, we were used to it. We were protected by our own army. We were familiar with the names of every tax and every person who collected the taxes. They came, handed over the money, the receipt, that was such a distrustful certificate, we felt no need, and refused to take it. Even if it was stuffed into our hands, we did not value it, and just stuffed it into a corner that we could not even find.</p>
<p>Now the people who come to knock on the door with money bags are no longer familiar. We heard the unheard-of taxes from the mouths of those wolves, and when we heard them, we had to hand over the same amount of money. We were not allowed to say a word we wanted to say. This is already a world of ghosts and demons. People have human relationships, but these relationships no longer exist. It is useless to argue, and it is impossible to argue.</p>
<p>In the past, we went out without any worries. We walked long distances, and it was night. We rushed home and knocked on people's doors, or stayed in temples on the way. Now even a traveling merchant has to be locked at home. Not necessarily at night, but during the day, stepping out of his own home, a white bayonet will block the way. "Pass," this is our own land, the road we built, but there is a yellow obstacle standing on the road, holding a sharp gun, and the bayonet on the tip of the gun is blocking people's way.</p>
<p>Even people who shut themselves at home all day long cannot live a quiet life. It is not as if someone breaks into the house for no reason, loots the house, and tears down women. Why? Even our own doors cannot be opened or closed as we please, and a quiet family will be interfered with. Not only outside, there are yellow obstacles standing at every pass, but the yellow obstacles are entrenched in every corner. They can break into the house at any time, loot the house, and tear down women. Why is this? Is it just to search for "good citizen certificates?"</p>
<p>There should be countless disasters, and these tragic encounters can happen to people at any time. In the past, we continued our lives to enjoy life, but now! There is endless pain in life, and life is so fragile and tragically covered with permanent shame.</p>
<p>Although we believe that this shame can be washed away with blood, it has been a whole year since we lost our hometown. At first, I was so anxious to see and hoped for some news from home, but the news was so cut off. Later, finally, like other places, letters were able to pass again. I eagerly unfolded every letter from home, but what I got was not what I had expected. I was at a loss.</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered from the confusion that the same pair of scissors can cut off the news of the activity of wandering in the war zone and the homesickness of the "conquerors" sent to their homes across the sea.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Depression—In Hong Kong <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— He Lijiang</p>
<p>This piece of happy land after the war of resistance. To me, it seems like a desert. On this desert, what I feel is: loneliness, monotony, spiritual hunger, mental depression, sorrow of encounters, and a bleak future; however, my will is like iron, and of course, we are not pessimists.</p>
<p>My depression, I believe many young people feel it too, because there really isn't much work to do here. The adverse environment, the darkness of society, the hypocrisy of human relationships, if you haven't mastered the art of flattery and boasting, it's very, very difficult to find something to do, truly as difficult as ascending to the blue sky.</p>
<p>Although the Westernized environment is liked and enjoyed by a large number of people, hedonists indulge in spending extravagantly, with gold and paper in a drunken stupor, amidst wine, green lights, theaters, dance halls, tour agencies, restaurants, etc., there's no shortage of places to get intoxicated. Of course, these stimulants and narcotics naturally suit their tastes.</p>
<p>Deception, constraints, lack of freedom, no work to do, a life without interest, and a lack of meaningful and proper entertainment, therefore, spiritual hunger and mental depression are what many young people feel.</p>
<p>Golden light and a foreign atmosphere envelop this place, confusing the minds of many people, numbing their nerves, and dazzling their eyes, making them forget their origins and why they left their beautiful hometowns to come here. And what banner is this under? What kind of politics? What kind of place is this? Why is it like this? They couldn't care less. The behavior of the upper class is even more jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>In short, in terms of living: rice is as precious as pearls, firewood as valuable as cassia, and every inch of land is worth gold. Except for certain inferior goods, the price index for many clothing and household items is very high. Capitalists and landlords are making a fortune from the national crisis. In Hong Kong, I only feel countless sorrows and depression.</p>

<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>1.  I Have a Gun</p>
<p>I have a gun, and it's a Type 79 rifle.</p>
<p>I can't help but feel proud...</p>
<p>The blood all over my body is boiling because of this, vibrating intensely,</p>
<p>I seem to be unable to hold back,</p>
<p>I want to fire the gun,</p>
<p>Whoosh——</p>
<p>I cocked the gun and loaded a row of bullets.</p>
<p>Then, I likened myself to a true soldier.</p>
<p>So, under the dark night, I quietly and alone remained in the plains, on</p>
<p>the banks of the paddy fields where the rice seedlings had just been planted,</p>
<p>I even climbed the earthen mound,</p>
<p>and also ascended the majestic mountain range:</p>
<p>There, I held the gun and looked out over the ground,</p>
<p>Towards those mountains, waters, and the green fields, I couldn't help but laugh softly,</p>
<p>I murmured to myself: I am indeed the guardian of the motherland!</p>
<p>2.  An Intense Battle Awaits Me</p>
<p>An intense battle awaits me,</p>
<p>But I am not flustered at all,</p>
<p>Instead, I am more calm and more encouraged,</p>
<p>I began to sever all attachments,</p>
<p>I only use an angry heart to call out to myself,</p>
<p>Therefore, my blood is even more boiling,</p>
<p>I eagerly await the arrival of the battle,</p>
<p>I can't bear to wait any longer,</p>
<p>I want to fight,</p>
<p>I want to annihilate my enemies,</p>
<p>I know very clearly: the motherland will grow in battle.</p>
<p>I gripped the gun tightly, so excited that I was almost crazy,</p>
<p>Motherland, the freedom and light of the motherland!</p>
<p>3.  I Cherish the Bullets</p>
<p>When I received the heavy bullets, I trembled with excitement,</p>
<p>I gently stroked them,</p>
<p>I stared at their light reflecting in the sun,</p>
<p>I cherish them,</p>
<p>I counted them carefully:</p>
<p>One two three four five...</p>
<p>I counted them again and again,</p>
<p>My hope rests on every single bullet,</p>
<p>I want every bullet fired to blossom with my flower of hope,</p>
<p>I want every bullet to exchange for the life of a × person,</p>
<p>How much I love them!</p>
<p>I circled them around my waist, like receiving a hug from a dear person,</p>
<p>And when I felt that burden...that weight, the joy I felt was indescribable!</p>
<h3 id="e81">Literary Criticism in a New Stage <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>In the entire literary movement of China today, it is very obvious that creative practice cannot keep up with the objective reality of the war of resistance. However, there is something even more serious than this, and that is the great backwardness of critical practice. Since the start of the war of resistance to the present, the struggles of the past twenty-odd months have triggered infinite development and changes within our nation, greatly altering the appearance of China's reality. However, our literary critical practice and theoretical activities not only cannot keep up with the reality that is in a state of intense transformation at all times, but also cannot catch up with the creative practice that has already fallen behind reality. This undeniable backwardness is undoubtedly a loss for today's Chinese literary movement and a loss for the cultural struggle for the liberation of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Literary theoretical activities and critical practice should always stand ahead of creative activities, providing creative activities with constant guidance, review, and encouragement. Especially in today's newly emerging Chinese literary movement, whose foundation is still very fragile, creative activities need the cultivation of theory and criticism as much as an infant needs milk and a tender grass needs dew. It must have the guidance and support of sound theoretical activities and critical practice in order to achieve rapid and normal development. However, the backwardness of theoretical criticism in today's Chinese literary movement has caused creative activities to lose the milk and dew they need, and to lose their guiding center. This lack of nutritional materials is the most important reason why the Chinese literary movement has consistently failed to break out of the stage of immaturity and poverty, and has failed to keep pace with reality in every subtle and tortuous stage of development.</p>
<p>This serious backwardness in theory and criticism must be overcome quickly. For the sake of the development of our literary movement and the complete accomplishment of the anti-Japanese tasks in literature and art, people have often focused on strengthening literary theory and critical activities in the past. However, even today, as the war of resistance has increasingly deepened and moved into a new stage, and has brought many newer, more serious, and more urgent tasks to the current literary movement, our literary theory and criticism have still failed to achieve the truly expected strengthening or development. This is obviously a major defect. If we do not promptly carry out this aspect of supplementary work today, then the literary movement of tomorrow, which is also the literary movement of today, will inevitably lose its color and become greatly detached from today's intense reality of national liberation. Because reality is progressing, our theory and criticism must stand vividly at the forefront of every developing link of reality at any time and anywhere, enlightening literary creation with new paths that adapt to each link of reality, guiding its development, critiquing its work, and strengthening its struggle. Only in this way can the literary movement be closely linked to the reality of the war of resistance, mutually communicating and influencing each other, thereby enabling it to fully accomplish all the tasks it undertakes. Conversely, if theory and criticism cannot exert their leadership and critical responsibilities, then the separation of the literary movement from the reality of the war of resistance is inevitable, whether today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Strengthening and deepening theoretical and critical practice in the literary movement has undoubtedly been handed over to all Chinese literary workers today. This is one of the greatest and most urgent tasks of our Chinese literary workers in the new stage of the war of resistance. We cannot neglect this work, just as we cannot neglect our combat on the action front. Today, we have a new necessity that compels us to adopt a comprehensive critical review of our past literary critical theoretical activities, targeting our current objective anti-Japanese sentiment, and adapting to the great historical tradition of our nation, to build new theories and new criticisms that adapt to the new situation and new stage; to improve the theoretical understanding of our literary movement, to deepen the understanding of the general literary workers regarding the essence and turning point of the current stage of Chinese history, as well as the center and trend of the new stage of the real situation, to construct the basic methods of purely realistic, sinicized literary creation and criticism, based on our national revolutionary movement, based on the characteristics of our nation, and based on the content of the life and habits of the Chinese masses who are in hard struggle today, to lay the foundation for the complete system of Chinese literary theory - this is our greatest work today, the most meaningful work.</p>
<p>The increasingly serious and deepened real struggle in the new stage of the war of resistance demands that literature and art reflect and promote the struggle in reality with greater sensitivity and mobility. Therefore, the literary criticism in the new stage must first propose new creative centers in the course or development of every real struggle, point out the standard paths that current literary reflections need to follow, and regard the work of linking and coordinating the struggle of literature and art with the struggle of reality as its basic task. Therefore, our critical practice and theoretical activities today must complete its mission with a high degree of sensitivity, just as the famous Soviet literary theorist I. Bespalov said, it must "on the one hand, make a summary of the times, and on the other hand, review the habits of literature from the style and style, only in this way can it not only give the possibility of evaluating literature, but also give the possibility of proposing new topics to literature."</p>
<p>The demands put forward by the new stage for theory and criticism are not only to continuously propose new topics for literary creation ahead of every development and leap, and to help and urge it to complete the work of these new topics, but also to demand the deepening of theory and criticism itself, because if theory and criticism itself cannot be deepened, then it cannot effectively lead the literary creation and literary struggle, so it must intensify its own training work, actively study the new aesthetic relationship to reality, explore new aesthetic ideals and new forms of popularizing literary criticism that are being formed, and engage in the creation of new aesthetics that concretely express the demands of our current reality on art.</p>
<p>The literary workers group is a great educational group. They need to educate the Chinese masses today to live and struggle, but they also need to be educated themselves. They need to obtain education from the middle of literary theoretical activities and critical practice. Therefore, in the new stage of the war of resistance, I need to deepen the work of educating the educators.</p>
