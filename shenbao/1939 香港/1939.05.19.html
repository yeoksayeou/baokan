<h3 id="c1">英美法聯合對日 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>英美法聯合對抗共同×人的日本，在今日已是客觀情勢事實上逼不得已的必要了。</p>
<p>日本侵略者侵華戰爭的幾種幻夢，現在差不多逐一粉碎了；第一，「速戰速决」巳絕對不可能；第二，整個征服中國更完全成了空想；第三，懇求第三國出頭調停，也已完全成了過去；第四，勾引漢奸的毒計也無多大的進展。</p>
<p>日本侵略者處在這樣進退維谷的情形下，自然想再試一試武力的冒險，以打開這一悶局。他們不能早日結束中日戰爭征服中國，但却遷怨於英美法蘇等第三國的援助中國抗戰，特別認爲英美法在華的權益已無再爲保障的義務，在英美法繼續援華的藉口下，公然宣稱有將英美法的權益及勢力驅逐出遠東的必要。日本特別强調英美法的租界地是抗日反日的根據地。這雖只是一種藉口，但其欲驅逐英美法的政治勢力出於中國，却是事實。這是繼英美法在華經濟勢力被蹂躪而來的必然的趨向。</p>
<p>但在目前，日本對英美法在華政治勢力的驅逐，還是第一步，還不出試探的態度。在這種試探當中蘊蓄看極大的危機。倘若英美法忽畧了這一點而再放任日本肆行無忌，侵略者是要得寸進尺的。鼓浪嶼的被佔，英美法若稍爲放鬆，上海及天津等租界就不能保障安全。鼓浪嶼問題確是英美法能否保持在華權益的一個重要的試金石。對付日本侵佔鼓浪嶼，最良善的辦法，是英美法聯合一致起來對抗。日軍在鼓浪嶼登陸並肆行無忌，已過週日而英美法各國截至昨日除空洞抗議外，尚缺少實際的行動。這使我們十分失望。但據今日英國海軍部的宣告，英美法軍艦已各派水兵四十二名在鼓浪嶼登陸，其總數正與在該地登陸的日本水兵勢均力敵。英國方面並己由海軍司令諾貝爾上將對日提出嚴重警告。這是英美法保衛在華權益的具體表現的第一步。相信英美法能繼續作下去，他們在華的政治權益始能維持得住。</p>
<p>日本對英美法租界的幾次騷極原當不出於恐嚇與試探，所以倘若英美法能强硬抗拒並講究實際有效的辦法對付，則可不費氣力而逼日本退却。本日路透社鼓浪嶼電傳：「在鼓浪嶼登陸的日本陸戰隊，大部分已於昨晚撤退」。這不消說，是英美法聯合採有效辦法對付的結果。對付瘋狂侵略者的辦法，只有强硬的手段，因爲侵略者大都色厲而內荏，特別是東方的侵略者因其內部的矛盾——如元老，重臣，穩健派軍人，及一部分財閥反對過分的胃險，反對和英美法决絕，而只少壯派軍人及代表言論機關極力主張對第三國强硬蠻幹——自然不能持久蠻幹到底。程咬金三下大斧，只能嚇嚇軟弱的對方，若碰到强硬的對手，只須稍爲招架，他也就棄甲曳兵而走了。</p>
<p>然而英美法的聯合對日，不能只是一時的，必須有持久性，因爲鼓浪嶼的被侵佔，不只是一地方的局部問題，而是關係全局的問題。</p>

<p>— 趙美</p>
<p>德國經濟　不能長期作戰</p>
<p>美國著名經濟雜誌『分析者』發表一文，詳細分析法西斯德國的經濟。該雜誌諭云：</p>
<p>「對外貿易，在德國整個經濟上是比較軟弱的二環。一九三八年德國的入口貨，超過出口貨四萬三千二百四十萬　布。德國沒有充分的存金和外幣，入超對于德國確是一個嚴重的問題」。</p>
<p>該雜誌以下又說，奪得奧國和蘇台德州，非但沒有减輕德國在對外貿易方面所感受的困難，相反的。反而加強了。「應當記得，在一九三六年，奧國所消費的原料，半數輸自外國，而德國那時却只輸入五分之一的原料。蘇台德州的入口原料的依存性，並不亞於奧國。奪得奧國和蘇台德州之後，使德國的食物問題，愈益尖銳化。奧國的農業只能滿足該國食物消費的百分之七十三——七十四，同時德國的農業也只足百分之八十二。　國只得輪入她所消費的百分之四十的小麥，大部分肉食和其他最重要的食物。蘇台德州是工業區，需要更多的食物輸入。同時，由奧國和蘇台德州的輸出，自各該地被德國奪取以來。巳經說减』該雜誌又繼續說：十分顯明，德國是不能長久支持這穩商業的損額的。該雜誌詳細計算德國的存金和外幣之後，作一個結論說：「表面上，似乎德國也有些微存儲，其實爲數很少，决不能彌補像一九三八年那樣虧損的對外貿易的損額。德國企圓或用減少輸入，或用增加出口，或用調整兩奢的方法，以滅少出口貨與入口貨之間的差額。</p>
<p>討論到德國是否能够减縮入口貨的問題，該雜誌說介使這是可能的話，那末主要是想要更進一步的减少食物的輸入，首先是脂油。至於工業原料，那末在法西斯政權成立以來，雖然法西斯者高喊所謂「四年計劃」，德國工業的原料輸入的依存性，非但沒有减少，並且巳經激增。該雜誌發表一有趣的統計表，表明德國自法西斯政策成立以來的這幾年中，原料輸入的變化，假如規定一九三三年輸入的指數是百分之二百，那末一九三八年德國生國的輸入却增加到百分之四百十八，五金增到百分之一百五十四·棉花百分之八十三·獸毛百分之八十八，皮張百分之八十六，煤油百分之一百八十五，亞麻百分之一百十七，膠皮百分之一百八十一。「卽使能够某種程度的滅少輸入的量數，但因世界市場上原料價值的提高，它的支出並不會減少。」</p>
<p>『分析者』論到德國的出口貨，說前途絕對暗淡。第一，抵制德貨遝動加强，尤其是在德國排斥猶太人之後。第二，其他國家的競爭加緊，使德國不得已把自己的貨物賤價出賣。德國的貿易方法引起他國採取對策。例如，美國對於德國往南美各國的輸出，擬採取對付方法。英國出口貨基金的增高，是證明英國已打算加緊競爭。英美締結新商約，英鎊市價跌落，也是證明對於德國貿易不利的。</p>
<p>該雜誌作結論說：「雖然在設法解除難關可能改着德國的貿易，但是無疑，貿易前途决不會給予法西斯德國當局的安慰。德國出口貨與入口貨之間的差額，對於德國今後用從前工業生產的程度來執行軍備和國防的計劃，無疑是比較嚴重的威脅。這也是說明，一德國無論如何不能指望作順利的戰爭，或進行長期抵抗，假使她受到經濟壓迫的時候。</p>
<p>德國人民　反法西斯運動</p>
<p>德國資本現在向工人級階的生活水平和基本權利進行新的空前的進攻。法西斯如　如王的準備戰爭，把全部重擔放在勞動者的肩上。首先是工人的肩上。</p>
<p>在德國實施新的法令，各種工業部門工作時間都延長到十小時，『特別重要的（卽軍火和與軍火有關的工業部鬥）甚至延長到十四小時。當然，現在大多數工業部鬥都是屬於這一類。「佛郎克孚特日報」不久遺要求施行十八小時工作制。</p>
<p>法西斯在「合理化」的口號之下，進攻工人，工人進行頑强的鬥爭。法西斯企圖用殘酷的恐怖手段撲滅這鬥爭。禁止罷工，參加罷工的工人，受嚴厲處罰。但是工人仍舊找到實際反對法西斯「合理化」的方法。那便是减低工作的速度。這是秘密的罷工方法，在改善待遇的鬥爭中，頗收效能。</p>
<p>在德國國外發行的反法西斯報紙，滿載德國採用這方法的成功。例如一個鑛工寫道：「在上西列齊省裏，工人積極實行工作緩慢的口號。每一公斤多餘的煤，每一小時多餘的工作，都是有利於戰爭的。我們不願意戰爭。」</p>
<p>建築軍事防禦工程的工人狀况特別艱苦。德國西陲國境建築要塞，有數萬工人。他們的生活很苦，苦得簡直可怕，德國失業工人很明白要塞工作的艱苦，所以他們拒絕去做工。平常總是强迫他們去。是這樣辦的！由勞動市埸通知失業工人，在指定時問必須到車站報到。到了車站，載上特備火車，用重兵看護着，開到國境去。假使工人不到，當天警察便到他家去把他綁去，强迫開往國境。</p>
<p>裝載失業工人而開往西陲的列車，這裏叫做「死刑者的列車」。被派去的人在車站上和親屬告別情形很悽慘。時常形成反法西斯示戚。後來法西斯挺進隊便禁止親屬到月台送別。</p>
<p>許多從事防禦工事建設的工人，忍不住艱苦的條件，紛紛逃往外國或逃囘內地。假使沒有逃成，反而弄到警察的手裏，那末他們便被押往集中拘留營或是槍斃。特里爾和阿漢的監獄己有人滿之患。阿漢現正建築大監獄。</p>
<p>要塞工程的工作時間每日不下十四小時，工資並不超過失業工人的救濟金。</p>
<p>對於法西斯政權的不滿，在德國民衆各階層中日益高漲。反法西斯運動澎湃。德國各大城市都有大批反法西斯傳單數發，柏林有一張傳單這樣寫若：『德國人民不願意戰爭。應常使工業製造有用的貨物。提高工資！打倒戈林的食物代用品』！署名是「德國人民陣線」。另一張在多爾蒙特散發的傳單，這樣寫道：『多爾蒙特市民們！現在大家都明白：希特勒要戰爭。　使發生世界大戰，希特勒使是罪魁。德國民主人民共和國萬歲』，署名：『多爾蒙特反法西斯者』</p>
<p>上西列齊的許多本煤礦裏，最近有大批這樣的傳單散發：『要求漲工錢，不給戰爭縱火者挖一斤煤，鑄一斤銅』！</p>
<p>大批傳單號召援助西班牙人民，不久還發生這　的一個事實：不久希特勒到撒蘭布留根去，他到達的前夜，希特勒將在那裏演講的當地戲院的窗戶上出現紅色的標語：『算賬的時候來到了』，警察沒有能够捉住這寫標語的人。</p>
<p>德國工人的戰鬥精神，並沒有摧毀。反法西斯運動正在德國展開着，這運動日益包括更多的廣大工人羣衆。</p>
<p>經濟危機　在日德意三國</p>
<p>最近世界經濟危機的發展，在法西斯侵咯者各國適應着戰爭把它們的經濟加以改造。軍事原料的强大需要，在中國，西班牙，與阿比西尼亞進行着的戰爭，這些狀况相當地阻止了一般的生產過剩的爆發。然而由於它們的商品在世界市場上銷售的困難。由於它們缺少現金購買足够的原料，這些國家底生產，尤其是非軍事工業底生產，近來亦大加縮减了！</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>在德國，希特勒匪徒們一向就在吼着法西斯制度下的經濟不會遭受危機。雖然德國的戰爭經濟在某種程度上阻止了生產過剩，德國經濟底發展，終於達又着法西斯匪徒走門底王言，被捲入到世界經濟底危機裏，這首先表現在財政危機中。交易所內股票底行市大加減低了。由於重新增加　稅，各種股票大量地被拋賣出去。馬克底價格在國外大大的减低，德國已走上了通貨膨長的驗途，根據着『新世界論壇』週刊的統計，我們看到以下情況德國貨幣流通額的統計（以百萬馬克爲單位）</p>
<p>紙幣流通額　硬幣流通額　總計</p>
<p>一九三二年十二月　四一四一　一五〇一　五六四二</p>
<p>一九三七年十二月　五八八四　一六一五　七四九九</p>
<p>一九三八年　六月　六八三〇　一六三六　八四六六</p>
<p>這說明了貨幣流通額比希特勒專政以前增加了二十八萬萬二千四百萬馬克。通貨膨脹必然地减少了馬克底購買力，再加以德國國民收入底銳减，對於德國經濟發生了嚴重的影響。德國的對外貿易呢？，英美比各國在世界市場上的競爭，使德國商品底銷路日益困難。只是一九三八年七個有的統計，德國對外貿易入超了一萬萬六干七百萬馬克之多。這不能不使德國的輸出品發生生產過剩，同時入超底現象使德國不能獲取足够的外幣以購買它所必需的外國原料。爲了免强應付國外原料底　買，德國底現金大量地流出，以至國庫日益空虛。</p>
<p>不錯，法西斯狂徒們在大吹大擂它們的自足自給經濟，定出了並且巳進行着他們的『四年計劃』。可是效果呢？希特勒在三月間大吹了煤油底自足自給，然而煤油底輸入量比任何時都高：人造橡皮底生產並未能减少天然橡皮底輸入。在四年計劃中唯一有些成續的是織維品底製造，然而亦只能補充紡織品底一小部分。四年計劃中的許多工作由於原料與勞動力底抉乏不得不停止，就是原來哄動一時的柏林興幕尼黑的改造計劃亦早已無聲無臭。</p>
<p>德國人民底生活呢，由於擴展軍隊及軍事工業的關係，由於數十萬動者被關在集中營及各地監獄的關係，失業者底數量是『减少』了，然而他們陷在比失業更悲慘的生活裏，農民的農產品被政府以强制的低價收買了去，把農民們投在生死莫由的苦境裏，法西斯統制下的德國人民被陷在中世紀的地獄中，希特勒在瘋狂地進行戰爭，以這樣貧困的經齊與苦痛的蘊藏着强烈反抗性的人民來支持侵略戰爭，其結果會易促進法西斯蒂底死亡！</p>
<p>意國</p>
<p>另一法西斯國家——意大利遭受着比德國還要困難的苦境。意大利資本主義是貧弱的。它無有近代工業底重要原料，如煤鐵，石油、五金等等。在本國內還存在着强大的封建殘餘，農業比較落後。勞動生產力低小，一般的國民收入低微，國內市場窄小。這逼使着意大利工業工與日本相仿，只有在國外找　出路。由於上述原因，意大利工業在世界濟濟上已處於不利的地位，在新的經濟機危中，它在置界市場上更遇到强烈的競爭者，再加以它的日益擴展的軍事工業所急需的國外原料，這樣使意國的對外貿易陷入了入超的地位，一九三七年對外貿易的入超竟達到五十六萬萬二千九百萬里拉之多，償管意大利瘋狂地擴展軍備，而且軍事工業底擴展，在意大利工業發展中佔着相當大的比重，但是工業生產底總額還是降低了的。一九三七年的工業生產爲一一七（假定一九二八年爲一週），而一九三八年則减爲一〇五。一些工業部門中的生產（如五金工業）則减少了百分之二十五（見國際通訊四十二期）意大利貨幣里拉亦日趨於貶值之一途。一九三六年十月間，在墨索里尼『恢復與美金的舊的價值比例』的法　下，里拉却又貶值了百分之四十二！</p>
<p>也許墨索里尼以毫無阻碍地侵佔了阿比西尼亞來自豪，可是阿比西尼亞底佔領不但未解决了銷路缺乏與原料缺乏的問題，不但未加强意大利資本主綫底伏况，反而更加使它削弱了，　化了。爲了鎭壓可七西尼亞人民持久的反抗，爲了開發那兒的富源，意大利到現在也還須支支大量的資金。一九三七年度開發阿比西尼亞的資金，根據意大利財政部長一九三八年五月十八日的講演，共支出了一百七十五萬萬里拉。根據英國『新財政』雜誌的計算，意大利在『結束了』阿比西尼亞戰爭以後每月還須支付四萬萬里拉的軍費少了意大利的現金，危害了里拉底穩定，除了對於阿比西尼亞的廳大支出一無所獲以外，侵略西班牙的戰爭亦大大消耗了意大利的經濟。墨索里尼從來未公佈過他對於西班牙的侵略費用。根據『新財政』雜誌的計算。除了供給佛朗哥的費用之外，意大利在西班牙戰爭中每月還要支出一百五十萬萬左右的軍費，這同樣是一字無從補償的損失。意大利瘋狂的軍擴，西班牙底英勇抗戰以及阿比西尼亞的持久的游擊戰將會使意大利經濟陷了枯竭。雖然墨索里尼狂妄地大吹其意大利是第一等的軍事勢力，雖然他進行侵略戰爭中找求生路，然而這只能恐嚇一些無知的濡弱者，企圖轉移意國人民視綫於國外以减輕反法西鬥爭的欺騙而已，意大利底日趨疲弱的經濟是不能維持長期的大規模的戰爭的。</p>
<p>日本</p>
<p>日本：日本是侵略陣綫中最野蠻而同時又最貧困的一個。日本的工業生產被强烈的軍備擴充所激勵着，從一九三一年的九一（一假定一九二九年爲一百）增加到一九三七年的一七一，這已達到它的頂點。一九三八年的二月間，它的工業生產便已縮减了百分之十六。由於我國的堅持持久抗戰，由於日本的殘暴在世界上引起的廣泛的憤慨，世界各處爆發了普通的抵制日貨運動。因之爲日本收入主要源泉之一的國外貿易過到很大的打擊，變成了入超的狀况。據日本『獨賣新聞』的統計·一九三七年一月至七月問的日本對外貿易入超爲七萬萬二千萬强，一九三八年同期入超爲一萬萬八千八百六十萬。一九三八年入超减少的原因是由於日本缺乏之外幣因而不得不强烈統治外國原料底輸入及使用，這是　爆露了日本金融底枯竭與其經濟上的更大困難。原料極度的缺乏，使着非軍事工業底生產縮降的更加利害，紡織業，絲織業，人造絲業及造紙業等工業部門停用的機器達百分之五十五。輸入的原料品只允許用在輸出品底製造及軍事工業上。對我國的侵略戰爭與對外貿易的入超逼使着日本現金大量外溢，因而使日本國庫的現金日益减少，因而亦影嚮到日金的暴跌。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義對於我國的侵略戰爭大大消耗了日本的財政。一九三八——三九年對華戰費的特別預算爲四十八萬萬五千萬元，一九三九——四十年的對華戰費預算爲五十萬萬元。但這只是指公佈的預算而言，未公佈的以及間接用於戰爭方面的費用當還有驚人的數目。在我國人民堅持持久抗戰直至最後勝利的過程中，這種龐大的戰費，將使日本財政更趨於貧困而至於崩潰的地步。這種龐大的支出，只能由兩個途徑上來籌措。一是舉行外債。向它的同盟國——德意法西斯蒂來借嗎？這兩個國家的專政者正在紋盡腦汁尋求外債而不可得，對於日本亦只有『愛莫能助』之感。向富有資會的英美去借嗎？這兩個國家在華的利益，特別是英國在華中華南的利益，己被日本帝國主義蹂躪殆遍。這樣，英美當然無多大借欵與日本而助長其侵凌自己利益的興趣，相反地，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，亦逼使着英美等資本主義國家對我抗戰與以援助，不久以前英美對於我們的借款只是後助底開始　丁。其次是發行內債與增加賦稅之一途，然而這必然引起日本人民更大的貧困化與日本財政更大的枯竭，引起日本人民對日本軍閥的鬥爭。十七個月的侵略戰爭把已日本人民陷於重大的苦痛中，一旦這種重大負担超過了日本人民所能容忍的飽和點時，在日本人民陣綫領導之下，日本人民與士兵將有倒轉柑頭推翻本國反動政府與建立日本人民民主共和國之一日。日本內部的困難將隨着我國抗戰之日益增進的堅持性而增進着，誠如毛澤東先生所說，它是我國抗戰最後勝利底要素之一。</p>
<h3 id="c3">戰時我國之新發明 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

<p>開吸式電磁控制開關　華生電器廠發人，以電磁吸鐵原理，啟閉電燈，在原理及一般構造上，應用之處已多，但該開關之拉鈎跳片及活動觸頭部分構造尤層新頴台於實用。</p>
<p>風球　發明人舒明海，經詳加比較。該項風球，扇葉部份，確與普通電扇之講造不同，夏日拂暑，又多一種工具。</p>
<p>自來錫電烙鐵　發明人李幹民。係裝置一圓形鎔錫筒之鐵筒，筒外繞以線圈，通電流後，則筒之四週受熱，錫卽鎔化而積于筒內，視普通之電烙較爲便利。</p>
<p>坐煕自由車　發明人黃史典，係于普通自由車外，加備鋼骨帆布床面，如將車拆開，利用其零件改裝爲床架，將帆布床面裝上，卽成臥床，可作臥宿救護等用。</p>
<p>人力車資計數表　發明人蔡順富，該表自動裝置，里程，車資記錄，轉動控制及照明四部分，係利用各種機械配合而成用以計算人力車行車里程以及車資堪稱便利。（國新社）</p>

<p>其次請言工業。上文論及農業政策、會以農業興工業之配合、爲今後我國農業政策之主幹，工業界爲謀增加原料之供給、應有以協助農產品之改良與運銷；農業界爲謀產品之易於脫售而獲善價，應有以適應工業界之需要。苟能使農工二業之生產與需要、發生緊密之聯繫、則一方不至感無可用之原料、一方不至陷產品滯銷之苦境、二者相成、則百事供興、近代戰爭之勝負、由於人力物力財力持久興否之比賽、在今日環境之下、欲發展工業、期能實現旣定之政策、必斟酌實際情形、以定緩急先後、又必改正過去缺陷以减少發展阻力、而後始能增厚抗戰力量、及奠定建國之基礎也、</p>
<p>居今日而言吾國之工業建設，自必以加緊戰時生產爲目標。欲達此目的，在組織方面，應有健全嚴密之統制機構。在經營方面，應　總理遺敎及中央政策；凡與國防有關之重工業及基本工業，皆以國營爲原則；其餘大小工業，以民營爲原則，而由政府予以督導獎勵與協助。如此始能循序發展，以促進戰時工業生產，及樹立戰後工業之基礎。政府爲獎勵生產及保護私人營業計，苟非事屬必要，宜採用相當寬大政策。西南西北各省，農礦寶戲極　，取之不盡，用之不竭，工業建設之條件，天然具備；吾人爲求我國新工業之建設，應首先注意此廣博天然富源之開發，以增加原料之供給，使國防及民生工業，皆以中國天產之富，人力之庶，必能兼程並進，長足進展，於較短之時日中，樹立强大之新工業焉。</p>
<p>今後方針</p>
<p>建設工業，非僅開發富源已也，又須應各種天產之地域分佈，建樹各種不同之工業中心，實行地區分工，分頭並進，以收因地制宜之效。每一工業中心之建樹，必須考量共交通狀况，視察其資源豐嗇，研討其需要情形，斟酌於三者之間，以爲設施之標準，而各種工業產品之分配與籌劃，亦可依此而爲合理可靠之决定。建設工業，非僅注重重工業及大工業已也，蓋民族工業之建設，必以自給自足爲其終極之標的。中國工業基礎。本屬薄弱，建國創制，宜有兼籌幷顧之宏規，而無偏頗疏陋之過失，不惟輕工業小工業不能偏廢，卽農村副業，及家庭手工業，亦應竭力倡導倡庶幾集腋成裘，有以補重工業大工業之不足。况多數大工業非短時期間，所能完成，而近代工業之趨勢，又偏重分散，以避免戰時之殘破，中國原有鄉村工業，更未可任其凋零，而須加以扶持與改良，於主要工業建設之外，各種工業間之聯繫，及各業間之工業，亦應加以建設以收聯絡機動之功、卽工業試驗及工業調查，亦須注意進行，以及精益求精之效果。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c20">動員中的　晉西婦女兒童 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 穆欣</p>
<p>【民革社汾西通訊稿】這是一個文化最落後，交通最閉塞的地區。在過去，廣大的婦女大衆，一直都在一種悲慘奴役的生活裏混亂着，她們被人家看作商品一樣的出賣，童養媳，「殺嬰」這些制度，都是使婦女從小的年歲，便受到非人的看待，城裏到鄉村，婦女自小便受着纏足的「苦刑」，她們永久都沒有受到敎育的機會，而且她們自己提本就沒有讀書的念頭，整天被丈夫孩子，一些瑣碎專情挽束着，直到病老死亡爲止。兒童也有着最悲慘的命運。大多寒苦的孩子，根本沒有讀書的機會，很小的時候，便做着成年人同樣笨重的工作和勞働。</p>
<p>但是，自從抗戰的烽火，在東方，在西方，在整偶戰區開始燃燒的時候起，過去這種落後的局面，都在這新的形勢下改變了。像所有的靑年人，壯年人開始了抗戰動員一樣，婦女與兒童也開始被廣泛的組織着，幷且受到普通的敎育與訓練，婦女救國會，兒童救國會，出現在每一個極其偏僻閉塞的角落，鮮明的爭取民族的解放的旗織，被她（他）們到處高高舉起來。她（他）們的悲壯的救亡歌聲，在每一個角落裏漾溢　，顫盪在廣大的鄉村中和山野裏。</p>
<p>根據山西公犧洪趙中心區的統計，在去年十月份，晉西這一個抗×據根地中，已經成立了八百三十個婦女救國會，擁有三萬六千二百二十八個會員。兒童救國會成立的總數，是一千一百四十二個，共有二萬八千五百二十一個天眞的兒童團結在她的周圍。幷且這些團體的組織一天比一天的擴大着，她（他）們自被組織起來開始，大半都受着組織的訓練，幷且用小組把他們分別的編開，過着規律的集體生活。</p>
<p>一般的，婦女救國會的工作，經常的有這幾種：一，對于婦女本身敎育和組織，宣傳纏足等壤處，把她們自家庭中拉到會場上，參加目前這神聖的戰爭；二，勸自己的子女上前綫，寫慰勞信等，鼓勵前綫將士，她們還當常號召與前綫將士們縫洗衣服、三，擴大後方的生產，增强抗戰力量，養育家畜，帮助田地的收穫及耕耘。四，組織婦女自衛隊。有很多地區裏，，女自衛隊都巳組織起來，她們不但像男自衛隊一樣受訓，問時還像男子一樣站崗放啃，盤查行人，有過路的人，從她們身前走過，拿着大刀的女自衛隊員便問你要「路條」來看。在農忙時問，她們喊出「丈夫去耕地，老婆替他們放哨」的口號。可惜因爲封建思想的難以迅速更改，婦女工作幹部的缺乏，女自衛隊還未普遍發展起來。五，各區建立了各級行政會議，給輿人民參政的自由，在各地選舉中，婦女救國會也都活動着選舉她們的代表，這　工作也同樣是現了上邊的弱點，而不能更如熱烈起來。</p>
<p>擎着抗戰火把的朋友，也一樣的熱烈的幹着他們能够幹的工作，任憑很小的孩子，他都能哼唱着很多的抗×歌曲。『日本是我們的×××』『最後的勝利是我們的！』很深的印在小孩的腦際，我會問過一個十二歲的孩子，『甚麼叫做統一戰綫？』他很自然的說，『中國人不分黨派，不分窮富，不分男女老幼，聯合起來打倒×××××』他們常常手拿着大刀，站在村頭担任放哨的責任。在晉西各地行走，你可以在各個地方看見這些小英雄的踪跡，他們那種非常認眞的態度，使你們受到很大的感動。很多只有十多歲的孩子，他們都用步槍打過靶。有一次，記者問汾西暖泉頭的放哨「小兵」：「有　的大漢奸來，你拿刀也沒法殺他，你怎麼辦？」他很天眞的說：「讓道個孩子去報告軍隊，我用刀先砍他的腿，他的腿斷了，便得臥下，我再砍斷他的××××」後來問他，他才只有十一歲呢。</p>
<p>很多英勇的婦女與兒童，都堅决的參加了正規軍的隊伍，靑年抗×决死隊所屬的曹誠總隊，原先有一個軍隊全是「女兵」，而且都是鄉村婦女武裝起來的。後來因爲行軍的不方便，才用說服她們的方式，把它們遺散在山西政治保衛隊里，小孩子佔有好幾百的數量，其他的部隊里，也那有戰鬥很久了的十四五歲的「小兵」。現代靑年抗×决死隊。縱隊部還有一個婦女兒童隊。</p>
<p>在决死隊里，有四五个話劇團，這里邊小孩子佔有相當大的成份，在趙城，洪洞，蒲縣，汾西等縣，都有一个「婦兒工作團」，他們到處振起悲壯的歌聲演白話劇給老百姓看，作深入宜傳的動員工作，把千百个民衆，從混沌的境遇里，拉向堅决　戰的路子。</p>
<p>積存在婦女兒童中間的，那種抗×偉大的力量，已經開始在普遍的動員着，雖然，這種動員今天還存有着極多的弱點，但是，已經發揮了種大的力量，幷給以×寇漢奸以很多的迫害！</p>

<p>中華民族的抗日革命戰爭，是爲全中國民衆爭獨立爭自由爭幸福的戰爭，如果這次戰爭而半途妥協，則不僅國家淪亡，而全民受辱，卽我中華民缺子孫，亦將被陷於萬劫不復，卽整個世界和平與人類文化，亦將遭法西斯俊略者之蹂躪屠毒至於不堪設想。但是目前抗戰，還在日趨新的艱苦之境；而×人及漢奸，則正在千方百計的企圖破壞我　結阻　我抗戰，因此我們要動員全民族的生動力量來支持抗戰，粉碎×好毒計，這　不僅希望於國內同胞，同時史祈望於海外僑胞之努力，這裏不僅希望匹夫從戎，同時更祈望於二萬二千五百萬匹婦之奮起參加！</p>
<p>吉隆坡橋商官文森獨資組辦文森女子回鄉服務隊，一行七人巳於昨日由星洲返國抵港，日內出發東江爲前綫將士服務。我們首先要對文森隊歐巾幗，王春紅，李逢娣，祝少珍，賀玉蘭，葉淸秀，古秀英等七位女僑胞奉致崇高的敬禮，因爲你們首先囘應了烽火中苦難中之祖國的呼籲，第一次以愛國華僑婦女的英勇的姿態，囘到祖國的懷抱，爲祖國的獨立自由與幸福而奮鬥！在曳曳沓沓的奢侈淫逸的士女中間，你們是多麼可以敬愛可以自傲啊！在奮發有心投奔無路的士女中間，你們是多麼英勇的先鋒隊啊！成千成萬的後援者，將追從你們所高擎着的「拯救祖國去」的旗識之後！其次，我們更以最崇高的敬體，献給吉隆坡僑商官文森氏！因爲出資援助僑衆回國服務，不僅較諸任何　華的行爲更可傲人，而且較諸任何局部性的　善捐款更有重大的意義。這行為不僅可為千萬殷富僑商的　範，而且亦大可爲僑胞任國際爭光，大可堅強了國際正義人士援助中國的决心！</p>
<p>追從七位華潘中的女英雄，向烽火中的祖國邁進吧！追從吉隆坡僑商官氏之後，爲苦難中的祖國而踴躍捐輸吧！</p>

<p>— 育萬</p>
<p>抗戰後滿佈在港九的洋樓區域</p>
<p>『船行覺岸移』，香港的洋樓並不「少』，祇是人來得太『多』吧——給×人趕走的難民，條人潮一般漂流到大海之濱；偌大的香島，此時正好使難民們「彼岸同登」了。</p>
<p>風平浪靜的時節，島上的樓字，一　甚而至於一座要出租了，縱然標貼了字條，至少也要一二天或至於一星期才有人過問的，樓租和待遇還得再三商量。然而，時至今日，別說一層一座，雖一房一角之小，除了要討三倍以上的租值之外，還得講什麼「　金」一佣錢」呢。房子要出貢了，簡直用不着標貼字條的，縱然標上了，也决不告訴人以門牌號數的……襲斷也好，把持也好，找房子　得「低首下心」！</p>
<p>『求過於供，價格就高』，這是必然的觀象，人擠得意多，租金便提得念高！難民中不少要想做生意，瞣幾個錢來糊口維持生活的，然而，在資本主義社會之下，幾許難民如何去鑽營呢？</p>
<p>利用樓梯下面來闢商店，這委實是『地盡其利』啊！饑餓者羣，他們沒有能力開店戶，只得向樓梯下面求出路。</p>
<p>這並不是偶然瞥見的情况，而是普週的現象。這半年來，我們走到街頭，祇消稍一留神。隨處都能看到樓梯下面的小商店。不論香港　九龍　每一個住宅區，如堅道，黃泥涌道，彌敦道，大埔道等，在石屎的，士敏土的，或者是意大利批擋的權梯門口，幾乎都看到這些侷侷促促的小商店。這裏有裝飾得唐哉皇哉的一個門首。有橫七豎八，陳設了大小玻璃櫃架的小　，掛滿了西文雜誌的，有堆塞了文房用品的，所謂現代化，新型的窗飾，不期竟應用於樓梯下面的角落裏，他們，掙扎着的他們，何嘗不是一樣的慘淡經營呢？看啊，閃燦的電燈，把他們的雜貨映　得通明了，嬌媚的盆花，把他們的門面，都點得紅紅綠綠。</p>
<p>有的是拿一百幾十元來做血本的，有的是拿二百塊錢來展開他們的「美夢』，至於一二十元作堅苦奮鬥的，也頗不少。他們賣些什麼？他們沒有貨倉和增棧，他們祇是資本主義制度下的「小販」罷了。用品方面，他們有的是西式的信紙和信封，花巾和領帶；雪水呢，唇脂呢，甲油呢，祗要是來貨平而易聽錢的，他們都應有盡有；食物方面，他們更含包萬象了餅干也有，西餅也有，其餘則橄欖，藥梅，嘉應子，合桃酥，魚皮花生，鐵精牛肉，奇衛糖，撒騎馬……何嘗不是樣樣俱全？至於玩的東西，則更是百分之百了，模型祇，是近來最流行的東西；縱使是坭公公，木兎子，紙靑蛙，也一樣的縱橫錯雜竭盡迎合主顧的能事，</p>
<p>小商店裏，看不到大腹便便滿身銅臭的司理，看不到長衫短褂的老板，看到的祇有咬緊牙關爲生活而掙扎的命運反抗者。中年的，他們或許竟是論陷區夷的小商人，老年的，那更是竣氣竣力的在苟延餘生！其中，最值得人注意的，問題亦最嚴重的，要算是許的年輕姑娘了。她們，正是靑春活　的時候，她們莫非是有家歸不得，有書不能念的吧，這一羣，這一羣，究竟是乘機抓錢的，還是被迫出此呢？——他們，住在那裏的？啊！——一個棱形的梯角裏，他們就像蠶兒作蘭般找尋歸宿去。</p>
<p>聽說這機的一個樓梯口，也要十元八塊的租。所謂尺土寸金，就是這樣形成的夜幕拉開了，霓虹光管，映醉了太太小姐們的　　；小商店裏的女郎，—樣也抹濃了胭脂，在月痕般的眉梢募我們看見她微笑；她會心了，這一元八角的收入，糊口總算有方了！但是，這是眞正的出路否？眞正的出路在何處，　聰明讀者自己解答吧。</p>

<p>【新亞社訊】昨日下午四時、港菲網球表演賽、第二次在木　會舉行、秩序為（一）雙打、菲選手對林珍兄弟、（二）單打、菴邦對徐潤培、（三）單打、山渣士對徐煒培、三個節目、皆有可觀、最後一幕、可稱為「港菲埠際單打網球賽」、蓋大徐為港冠軍、山渣士為菲冠軍故也</p>
<p>第一戰</p>
<p>林珍兄弟初戰菲將、甚肯用心、祇以球運不濟、于第一盤竟　負四局、被山渣士及菴邦一對　至應付不來、林珍兄弟經此威脅、改弦易轍、有機即送高球向對方之弱點進攻、按步追趕、做成五比五之和局、此後山澄士之高壓漸次改進、不比昨日之毫無把握、擊破兩林戰略、以七比五得勝、第二盤、菴邦大演身手、一攻一守、皆堪讚歎、網前『撲壓』一道、尤為神化莫測、在旁觀戰之港督、亦屢次鼓掌、結果菲將再以六比四勝第二盤、成績如下山菴——七比五　六比四—林珍兄弟</p>
<p>第二戰</p>
<p>徐潤培與菴邦作單打賽、小徐在第一盤全力以赴、打成四次平手、競爭頗劇、小孩子菴邦不獨擘殺利害、防守搶救、亦甚出色、小徐送出之兇險　兒、每被其「溜冰式之快步一一打囘、觀衆不斷叫好、菴邦弱點、是在反手、故小徐屢向其左路抽送、可是菴邦跑步敏捷、詭計多端、彌補　處、卒以七比五勝第一盤、第二盤小徐散漫起來、再以一比六敗于菴邦、昨日小徐在首盤中、表演佳妙、一看成績表、卽知小徐大有擊敗菴邦之可能、可惜小徐未能沉着應戰、致受挫折、</p>
<p>菴邦——七比五　六比一——徐潤培</p>
<p>第三戰</p>
<p>山渣士對大徐、山氏先發球、連「雙錯誤」三次、旋又連得「愛司」三次、卒乘發球之便、先取一局、次局大徐取正手猛抽及反手割球兩種手法應敵、奪囘一關、成一比一、此後山氏發球山氏勝、大徐發球大徐勝、相持不下、打至四比四平手、及至大以五比四攻破山氏發球局後、卽呈活躍、連送强勁之邊線球、山氏雖法抵擋、大遂以六比四勝、第二盤、山氏强能以二比〇佔先、但被大一氣以六比二反敗為勝、</p>

<p>— 應永玉</p>
<p>一、何謂外匯套息</p>
<p>上海外匯行市、向有近明遠期之分、而近期遠期之市價、因市面關係、發生差數、有時近期比遠期高、有時近期較遠　低、近來市面大都近賤遠貴、卽本月份之價比下月份之價低、若買進本月份期貨、同時賣出下月份期貨、卽發生一筆差額、此差額、卽利息；利息之高低隨差額之大小而定、其辦法、與從前之公債套息相仿、</p>
<p>關於套息計算利率之方法、有普通、法與簡易算法兩種、茲分別述之於後英金套息之利率計算方法、</p>
<p>（一）普通算法、</p>
<p>例如十二月二十四日上午外匯暗市開盤、英金十二月份價八辦士五九三七五、與二十八年一月份價八辦土五六二五、欲投資一萬鎊、能合月息幾釐、</p>
<p>十二月份應交出國幣</p>
<p>二十八年一月份可收入國幣差額＄1、019.24、即＄279、272、73一個月之利息、欲求台月息幾厘、</p>
<p>卽台月息三釐餘</p>
<p>（二）簡易算法、</p>
<p>將本下兩月份行市相差之數、以下月份行市除之、乘月利率卽得、</p>
<p>依上例</p>
<p>十二月份與一月份行市相差之數為03125、一月份行市爲8，5625、其算式如後、</p>
<p>·03125+8，5625×1，000＝3，64995033即合月三幣餘</p>
<p>日期　市價</p>
<p>七月廿一日　七月份　一八·四三七五</p>
<p>八月份　一八·二五</p>
<p>八月二十日　八月份　一七·二五</p>
<p>九月份　一六·九〇六二五</p>
<p>八月三十日　八月份　一七·二五</p>
<p>九月份　一六·七八二一五</p>
<p>九月廿二日　九月份　一七·二五</p>
<p>十月份　一六·九〇六二五</p>
<p>十月份　一六·九〇六二五</p>
<p>十月廿一日　十月份　一五·七〇</p>
<p>十一一月一五·五</p>
<p>十一月廿一日十　一月份　一六·〇六二五</p>
<p>十二月份　一五·九五三〇一二五</p>
<p>十二月二十日十二月份　一六·一八七五</p>
<p>一月份　一六·一二五</p>
<p>差額</p>
<p>合月息</p>
<p>二八班　七五　一〇·二七三九七二六</p>
<p>一二八七五　一二·九三九〇〇一八四</p>
<p>四六八七五　二七·九三二九六〇八九</p>
<p>三四三七五　二〇·三三二七一七一九</p>
<p>二五　一六·一二九〇三二二五</p>
<p>一〇九三七五　六·八五六〇二三五</p>
<p>〇六二五　三·八七五九六八九九二</p>
<p>普通算法與簡易算法原則一樣、其所求得之利率、大數相同、其尾數因英金合國幣之尾數有五捨六入之關係、略有差異</p>
<p>美金套息之利率計算方法、</p>
<p>例如、二十七年六月二十三日外匯暗市六月份價十八元、</p>
<p>七月份價十七元半、能合月息幾釐</p>
<p>（以美金十萬元計）</p>
<p>（一）普通算法、</p>
<p>六月份應交出國幣</p>
<p>七月份可收入國幣</p>
<p>差額＄15，873，02、即＄555，555，5一個月之利息、欲求合月息幾厘，</p>
<p>將＄15873，02×1，000（月利率）十＄555，559，55＝28，5714362</p>
<p>即合月息二分八厘餘、</p>
<p>（一）簡易算法、</p>
<p>六月份與七月份行市差數為50、七月份行市為17，5，其算式如後、，50　17，5×1，000　　28，57142857、</p>
<p>卽台月息二分八厘餘、</p>
<p>以上兩法所求得之利率、大數相瞪、其星數因美金合國幣之尾數有五捨六入之關係、略有差異、</p>
<p>附註、以上所求得之利率、關於經紀人之用金均未扣除、依銀行例需付售出外匯部牧入國幣之二十二分之一％、買入外匯部份、不付用金、</p>
<p>三、最近半年來美金套　息利率高低之比較</p>
<p>茲為此較上海半年來套息利率之高低起見、特擇美金套息最近六個月中每日之比較可以代表之日、（因　個月中各日套息因差額大小高低不一）分列於後、以觀變動之大概、華中公司』者、盈利竟　七百元之巨、其所以有如此收獲原因有二、</p>
<p>（一）歐美銷路起色、絲價因之暴漲、</p>
<p>（二）以中國廠商之存棧乾繭、統行沒收、</p>
<p>今錫地被迫由其統制之絲廠、計十四家、車數四千八百五十二部、尚在繼續侵略、正當商人、因不能立足、祇得在滬設廠、自去年四月份起、至本年目前為止、據絲業界最準確之統計、共為三十七家、分佈於租界區者計二十家、滬西越界地區者計十七家、總車數為五千八百三十五部、加開夜工者佔全數七〇％（如四千〇八十四部）、故目下上海絲車約一萬部弱、每月出絲三千一百餘担、吾人以乾繭四担製生絲一担　計算、則每月所用乾繭為一萬二千四百担、如全年開工、則滬上絲廠應儲藏之原料、須十五萬担方可維持也、以上統計、不過以每日每部出絲十八兩計算、至於工作之快慢、產量之多寡、皆須視各廠內部之管理情形而定、今以生絲產量列表如下、（量之單位為斤）</p>

<h3 id="c73">當前學生　對於體格訓練應有的革新（二） <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>過去學生從事體格訓練，大都為着踝程的限制，學校的强迫，敎員的監視，被動而動，免强而做，抱着為課程，為學校，為敎員而動的觀念。因此馬虎苟且，撩草　責，一離開了上課，就把體格訓練拋之九霄外雲這種被動免强的結果，學校體育就成了少數好動者的專利品，多數學生才有體育之名而無體育之實，體育的效果，也無從談起，這被動免强的錯誤　念必須革除，而自動自發的精神必具者一。</p>
<p>過去學生對於運動，成了兩種現象：一種是稍知運動的皮毛，就自嗚不凡，抱着惟我獨尊的觀念，　傲　巵，放縱恣使，覇持全校的體育，一種是不知運動為何物，視運動為出怪靈醜的舉動。抱着獻醜不如藏絀的觀念。視運動場為長途，終年無一動的與致，因此少數强者日益强，多數弱者日益弱的現象，自然形成。這傲視畏縮的錯誤觀念必須革除，而母　毋羞的精神必具者二，</p>
<p>過去學生，往往抱着運動為娛樂的觀念，有娛藥性的運動就肯做，在娛樂的限度內，無須用大力時就肯做；反之就不肯做。須知把運動代替娛樂則可，認運動的自的就是娛樂則不可。精神　用愈振奮，體力也愈用愈强大，用力時耐勞耐苦的程度愈卓越，體力的產生愈超羣，而體格的堅强也卓愈絕堅强體格的獲得，除了把用力來換取而外，雖充滿了金錢，集中了權力，都無法招致的。這認運動為娛樂的錯誤觀念必須　除，而耐勞耐苦的精神必具者三，</p>
<p>過去學生，往往抱着運動健身的惟一工具的觀念，運　時專心一志，一絲不苟的注意。一離了運動，就：穿衣只圖好看，狹窄緊束；食物只逞口腹，狼吞虎嚥；　跟只貧溫暖，閉窗蒙頭；行動只愛自由，浪漫腐化，這種運動而不衛生的結果，與衛生而不運動實無分軒徑；甚或不如，因衛生而不運動，日常工作中，多少尚有活動的機會；運動而不衛生，則運動所耗的體力，不銜生所耗的精力，都無法補給，必致再衰而三竭，這專重運動的錯娛觀念必須革除，而運動與衛生並重的精神必具者四。</p>
<p>二，材料的革新：運動種類繁多，性質功能也各各不同，它與時勢環境以及各人身體的情况，有着密切的關係，倘不能適宜的取材，恰當的運用，不察情勢不洽需求，人之亦云，耳食盲從的亂來一陣，所得的結果，不言可知，</p>
<p>在全面抗戰中，全國應集中一切力量，在抗戰的目標下努力，有裨抗戰的就採取，否則就屏棄，這是全團上午一致的主張，因此對學生體格訓練的取材，我敢武斷的揭兩個原則：要能節省經濟，增强抗戰的，「財力」；要能適用於軍事，增强抗戰的「人力」，根據這兩個原則，我們可以檢討當前學生臢格訓練的材料問題：</p>
<p>球戲和田徑賽運動，尤其球戲，是過去學生最好尚的運動，走遍全國，能用其他運動作為學生體格訓練材料的，可說鳳毛麟角，的確這種運動包含的天然動作多，自由活潑，適合人們自由的心理，大家愛它，不為無因：而動作敏捷靈活；也不能說它於軍事上絕對沒有裨益。不過它是非錢不行的運動，有十足貴族式的色采，不是目前各方為抗戰而撙節的情勢下所宜；而直接或間接有裨於軍事的動作，也嫌不足。</p>

<p>四·利率高低與資金逃避之關係</p>
<p>資金逃避一事、大都係國人將欵項存入外商銀行或買外匯、但套息利率之高低、影響資金套避亦鉞、因套息利厚而吸收國人經營外匯套息交易、且一般不懂套息為物何者、受報紙之宣傳卹息利率之優厚、亦相繼而加入焉、如十月份、因套息利率可扯月息二分左右、做套息交易、格外動躍、據中中交三行報吿、十月份中直接間接流入外商銀行欵項、數逾千萬元、但近兩月來因套息所扯之利率、日益低落、國人不願冉做此項交、將款項收囘、轉存華商銀行生息、為數頗鉅、約計在數百萬元、可云逃避資金已收囘一部、查外匯套息之主動者、大都係外商銀行、彼因頭寸關係、而定差額之大小、並大部份於成單上批明、此項外匯需存於該行、不計利息、故外國套息可謂外商銀行向國人吸收之信用借款是也、依現在市面情形而論、若套息所址之利率高、資金逃避必多、利率低、已逃避之資金、自然收囘、關於資金之　避、影響市面頗大、且匯劃貼現之暗盤行市漲跌、亦連帶發生關係、總而言之、外匯套息與資金逃避、實甚密切也、</p>

<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>一兩種人</p>
<p>三四兩日，重慶被炸慘酷，五日淸晨，蔣委員長於國府成立紀念會上，作過一番沉痛的演說，除指示急賑的具體辦法外，並要文武官員，下犧牲的决心，加緊工作，以答復敵機的狂炸。可是，開完會後，據說有些高官顯貴就帶　姨太太往鄉下安全地帶逃難去了；有些則陪着太太（姑說其是太太，其實我敢打賭是　太太！）到香港去玩了，委員長的訓示，他們把耳朶畫在牆壁上聽着。在這些人，眞所謂「女人至上，逃難至上」了！</p>
<p>然而，另一方面，賑濟委員會委員長，年逾古稀的老翁，難民之父的許世英先生，（林主席，蔣委員長親身視察災區，慰問難胞，姑不用提。）却勇敢地，於五日風塵僕僕地由香港飛到被怯弱的人認為沒有一秒鐘不危險的重慶來，親自主持一切急賑，事宜甚至每一個難民收容所，每一個災區，都親身去視察，督屬施賑，挖掘，掩　等工作。</p>
<p>對于這種無畏的工作精神，我們除無上地敬佩外，還得請那些「女人至上，逃難至上」的老爺們向許先生學習！</p>
<p>二送禮</p>
<p>西北數省，其窮苦狀况，實還出乎我們的想像之外。我這次的旅行，碰見過不少西北數省的高級官吏，他們每不勝　嘆地對我說：「林先生！在你們貴省當一個鄉長好過在我們這邊當一個區長；在你們那邊當一個區長；好過在我們這邊當一個縣長，在你們當一個縣長，好過在我們這邊當一個主席……」我常只是哈哈大笑無以對。後來經我細心視察他們的所謂農村與城市，非唯感覺到他們所說的笑話，含着十分的眞實，而且我就簡直驚嘆西北同胞怎麼活得下去！</p>
<p>然而，話雖然這麼說，「財源」却還是「有辦法』。試隨便舉一個例　！我看一位廳長先生一次就買了差不多二千塊錢的鹿角當禮物，送給他的上級。國難時期當一個廳長一年的薪水一次送了禮，他們怎麼活呢？要不然，他們的錢從那裏來呢？小子頭腦不靈，更無經濟常識。想不出來。</p>
<p>三儉約菜</p>
<p>國民公約第二條是「不違反政府法令」。政府曾公佈過法令，國難明間，宴會中餐每席不得超過八元是西餐每容不得過超一元，一般『闊佬」們當然，好國民會遵守國民公約，但他們遵守的辦法却有所不同，譬如說，某某請客、每席非一百元是不够架子的，如果西餐的話，每客非五元是有委某某的臉的。好吧，就那麼　吧，結賑時，把中餐一席開成十席，把西餐一客開成五客就是了。</p>
<p>同時，一切大小公私事體，必全在這觥觴交錯中商談，解决。</p>
<p>這是「儉約菜」的眞義</p>

<p>— 茜菲</p>
<p>離別了可愛的石牌千里迢迢，夢一樣的來到了　江。</p>
<p>石牌的有加利在　夜裏所散佈着的幽香，茶園的山色，竹林裏的湖光，還不是如在夢境麼？</p>
<p>我說得，月夜裏，月色　在綠的瓦背上，反射着銀漾的光芒，湖水像明鏡似的，偶燃一隻烏鴉劃過，在鏡波中投下一個影子。晚風吹若竹林，吹過樹叢中，透過樹裏是萬　燈光。</p>
<p>如今，如今一切都已成為夢幻似的過去了，紅墻綠瓦的新式建築，給換來一間破舊的古廟堂，剝落的泥塔，破壁的蛛網，地上，隨風揚起一股股的塵埃。我們坐在泥磚墊的木板上，敎授站在只有黑板的合前。拿起粉擦，不自覺的呌起釆：</p>
<p>「眞難擦呢。」於是，黑板給這剛硬的粉，擦得沙沙地響。會心的微笑，掛在每個人的嘴角上了。</p>
<p>要是高興，到室外去晒一身陽光，坐在庭階上，乾泥撤着，新生小花兒　着，空氣是靜寂的，只聞敎授的演籌聲。烏鴉頑皮而又使人厭煩的，不時「呀……呀……」從顯上掠過去。</p>
<p>矮小木架上掛着的鐘「當……當……」地響了，在我們的記憶裏，喚起了從前八角的　亭，曾經多少顆心，多少變足步，在八角亭內的鐘聲裏！齊一起來。</p>
<p>課室　不下去了。只好走往樹下去。有加利細長的葉子，已成為我們記憶裏的陳跡了。這兒僅有的是稀疏的柏樹，畢直的伸向高空。靜夜裏，再嗅不到有加利的幽香了</p>
<p>宿舍裏最閃眼的是竹　的窓戶，白糊紙的窓玻璃，　破窓　，便可以窺見房裏的人，多古雅的一囘專喲！</p>
<p>在石牌，扭開龍頭，自來水便汨汨湧來了，可是，現在，龍頭那兒去了，任挑水夫壓　了担杆兒，水池還是乾涸的，廣東人也只好幾天洗一次澡，然而，有時，鄉人喜歡給他三幾角子，就會把山水引進來，雖然是污濁的，也許會有小虫兒游來游去，然而，許多雙手放在肥皂泡裏　，把衣服擦起來了，心却會回到可愛的廣東去，隨處的靑山綠水的廣東啊。</p>
<p>晚上火油燈暗淡的發看昏黃的光，黑的頭，都伏到架在泥磗的條板上，寂靜地工作，只聽見黑夜裏的狗吠聲，恐怖的事會在我們心裏滑過去。</p>
<p>燈下，為了病而揮着淚寫家書的，靜靜地把他們的心邊寄回可愛的故鄉，甜密的家去了，可是，迢迢千里，且留待夢裏去追尋吧。</p>
<p>小縣城從此熱鬧起來了，每天，同學們在僅有的熱鬧的兩條街上，穿梭似的。瀓江每期的墟市，都有我們趁墟的份兒。</p>
<p>開展在我們眼前的，是一個陌生的環境，雖然這事交通太跋涉了，但這兒是後方重要的地方啊。</p>
<p>在生活裏，使我們逐漸去了解認識這新的環境，和陌生的人羣，瀓江的湖光，山色，柏林，正不　石牌當年，然而，這兒的空氣實在太窒息了，像四周圍繞着的高山沉壓着似的瀓江。只見人們癸苦地可又貧苦地生活着，山外事對他們有點遼遠了。</p>
<p>我們熱愛着家鄉，然而，也更熱愛營祖國。在這祖國遼遠的後方裏，讓我們的瀓情努力主開發着一個新團地吧。</p>
<p>江的　仙湖奔勝怒吼，正象徵看　靜的　江，也會有一天怒吼起來。</p>

<p>不過，　　要實地調查一次，或者可以攜得一些證據材料。因此，留下二　心探，預備保護朱琳，其餘的去了。</p>
<p>這時候，雨文早已時起　來，站在朱琳的一旁。他想走，怕走得　突，筱女僕認出來，他如果停留，也是有着同樣的危機。於是，他不安起來；但還要忍耐。他想：</p>
<p>『朱琳，這次可以試一試是不是同志！』</p>
<p>女侵並不注意他，因為　積蓄了通多的言語，正向朱琳傾吐：</p>

<p>得酒欲銷魂；</p>
<p>可憐　鵡洲邊路　客裏</p>
<p>逢君又送君。</p>
<p>秋已降臨到人間，但漢口還在熱浪的氛圍中：尤其是吃過午飯之後，室內的寒暑表，常在九十度以上，眞有點揮汗如雨了。『你不是說要往鸚鵡洲去嗎？老　就在那里等候呢』！施劍雄從外面突然地跑來，這樣向我催促着。他是剛從徐州突園囘來的，預定在武昌休息幾天，便要跟部隊出發咸寧去：而交通部戰地服務團的舒運鵬，不久也將　漢赴湘，所以老　特地選探了那「芳草萎還一的有名勝地，大家去作一次哲時分別的會餐，</p>
<p>說起老　，馬上會使人感到說不出的愉決；他從法國囘來後，就在曁大敎書，跟他的哥哥爽秋，眞是一模一樣，老是穿了一　藍布工裝，個子高高的，跑起路來蠻像卓別林，自從滬戰爆發直到國軍內撤，便决心要學起班定遠來；「萌性點吧！」豫你這樣的書　子，還想投筆從戎哩！」他的夫人嘲笑地，似乎表示不很信任。「那麼請你看好了！」老　抗議着，沒有多時，他接到張發奎將軍的電報，要他馬上動身到瑞昌去，果然實踐了他的願望：當我在江漢路種見他們的時候，已經全副武裝，快要向戰地出發了。</p>
<p>戰地的生活，自然不會「寫意」的：但你意識到在大時代之中，而能躬自參加，就覺得非常愉快：何况為了祖國，任何最高物質享受，都可以完全犧牲。老　　然拒絕了　陽大夏的聘約，去到前綫服務，誰說文化人不應如此呢？</p>
<p>到了鸚鵡洲，大家已是滿頭大汗，老　等已經先到了。我們各自將隨身帶去的餞行酒饌取出，借一家茶店摟上大嚼起來，劍雄大談台兒莊的戰績，滔滔不絕地；又鄭重地把李宗仁將軍的照片拿出來，給我們瞻仰了一囘：那照片是在台莊車站的月台上攝的，李將軍屹立於站名牌之前，丰神奕奕，使人肅然敬起。</p>
<p>太陽快要落山了，這才跟鸚鵡洲道別，老能知道我會謅幾句舊詩，一定要「報效」他一首，我在現代班定遠的壓迫之下，就隨便哼了前面的一絕。</p>
<h3 id="c79">面子 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>連外國人，不，西洋人，都說，中國人最講究面子，這句話常然可以作正反兩種解釋：正面，中國是禮義之邦，人人都要顧惜毛羽，何況面子，不肯為非作歹，給人笑話：反面，那末就是說，只顧面子，不顧「夾裏」，實際，因此躭誤了許多正事。</p>
<p>西洋人的說話大槪早對的。不過我們時常所看見的面子却又仰乎反面的居多數，這眞有些便人慨乎言之了。不是嗎：在前，能够在衙門裏走走的人，算是有面子的，能够要到免票，白坐頭等火車或大菜間輪船的，算是有面子的，坐了汽車，撞死個把人，賠去幾個錢，不必吃官司，算是有面子的。……現在，討新娘子，大出喪，鋪張揚厲，勞民傷財算是有面子的……多得很，不暇一一舉。</p>
<p>為什麼他們要這樣的面子呢？一言以蔽之，無非想得到一點虛榮，聽人　嘖稱茨暹了。於是沒有面子的，或者面子還不大的，就不惜千方百計，力爭上游，或者筆龍鱗，附鳳翼，以求置身靑雲之上，或者黏牢驥尾，以致身千里之遠。更加精明的，還有「打腫了面孔裝胖子」這一法。董胖子者，發福之人也，走到人前，何等感風，而面黃肌瘦，望塵莫及焉，沒奈何，就只好有屈兩　尊頰，打腫了一下再說·開山王府裏的嚴太師，願意請鄒老爺打到滿面烏靑，以便「皇司」（在皇帝面前打官司）打　，找回面子，也可以算作這樣精明的方法。</p>
<p>面子旣如此可貴：沒有的，不惜下「血本」去弄來，那末，已有的，目然不肯輕易放掉，到「死」也「要」了。於是在保全面子這一個重要動機之下，就發生了許多妙事：</p>
<p>明明不敢和人家打架，却捲袖掙臂，大喊你來你來！等到人家一奔而前，就囘身便走，用嚴重的警吿口吻說，有種的不要跑，等我去叫我的阿哥來！這一來，面子保全了。</p>
<p>明明怕老婆，却說免淘氣。怕老婆而至於下跪，却說「偷閒學拜年」。唐朝的任壞，說得更好，以一「生菩蔭」，「九子母」，「鳩盤荼」來自文其不得不怕的所以然。這一來，面子保全了。</p>
<p>這樣的日常細事，正也不知道有多少。漢朝甫越王趙佗的「聊以自娛」，晉朝阮仲容的「未能免俗，聊復爾爾」，都可婦入這一類，可見面子之必須保全，由來久矣。</p>
<p>我以為古人最善於保全面子的，可以推孟之反為第一。打了敗仗逃命，一個子落在後面，表示他「獨擋一面」，「掩護撤退」，已經很妙了，進城門時，還要「策其馬曰，非敢後也，馬不進也」，更表示他並不需要面子，這一來，就妙得連孔老夫子也連連稱讃其『不伐」了。其實，二『伐』而又冉『伐』了，照我看。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，也許有人以為我在挖苦面子，不贊成面子。這話倒也不盡然。正面的面子，『吾無間然』，自然贊成；就連反面的面子，我也以為：三代以上，惟恐好面子：三代以下，惟恐不好面子：要面子總比男盜女娼，無所不為好些吧。</p>
<p>於今『焦』頭瀾額，硬要『挺』一挺的『沒面目」，實在太多，而『杜』絕人氣，『與』風作浪的『鬼　兒』也不少他們都是殺人不怕血腥氣的好漢，眞叫我懷念面子不止！甚至明知其『假』，也以為廣何傷！</p>

<h3 id="e1">United Anglo-American-French Front Against Japan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>That the United States, Great Britain, and France should unite to confront Japan, the common enemy, is today an objective reality, an unavoidable necessity.</p>
<p>Several illusions of the Japanese aggressors in their war of aggression against China have now been shattered one by one. First, a "quick victory" is absolutely impossible; second, the complete conquest of China has become a complete fantasy; third, begging third countries to mediate has completely become a thing of the past; and fourth, the poisonous scheme of enticing Chinese traitors has not made much progress.</p>
<p>The Japanese aggressors, being in such a dilemma, naturally want to try again a military adventure to break this deadlock. They cannot end the Sino-Japanese War and conquer China soon, but they resent the assistance of third countries such as Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to China's resistance against Japan. In particular, they believe that Great Britain, the United States, and France no longer have the obligation to protect their interests in China, and under the pretext that Great Britain, the United States, and France continue to aid China, they openly declare that it is necessary to expel the rights and interests and influence of Great Britain, the United States, and France from the Far East. Japan particularly emphasizes that the concession areas of Great Britain, the United States, and France are bases for resisting Japan and opposing Japan. Although this is only an excuse, the fact is that they want to expel the political power of Great Britain, the United States, and France from China. This is an inevitable trend following the trampling of the economic power of Great Britain, the United States, and France in China.</p>
<p>But at present, Japan's expulsion of the political power of Great Britain, the United States, and France in China is only the first step, still a tentative attitude. In this tentative probing lies a great crisis. If Great Britain, the United States, and France ignore this point and allow Japan to act recklessly again, the aggressors will become more and more demanding. If Great Britain, the United States, and France relax slightly on the occupation of Gulangyu, the safety of concessions such as Shanghai and Tianjin cannot be guaranteed. The Gulangyu issue is indeed an important touchstone for whether Great Britain, the United States, and France can maintain their interests in China. The best way to deal with Japan's occupation of Gulangyu is for Great Britain, the United States, and France to unite to confront it. The Japanese army landed on Gulangyu and acted recklessly. It has been over a week, and as of yesterday, the United States, Great Britain and France have lacked practical action other than empty protests. This is very disappointing to us. But according to today's announcement from the British Admiralty, British, American and French warships have each sent 42 sailors to land on Gulangyu, and their total number is evenly matched with the Japanese soldiers who landed there. The British side has also issued a serious warning to Japan by Admiral Noble, the naval commander. This is the first step in the concrete manifestation of Great Britain, the United States, and France defending their interests in China. I believe that Great Britain, the United States, and France can continue to do this, and their political rights and interests in China can be maintained.</p>
<p>Japan's several disturbances to the concessions of Great Britain, the United States, and France were originally intended to intimidate and probe, so if Great Britain, the United States, and France can resist strongly and pay attention to practical and effective methods to deal with it, they can force Japan to retreat without much effort. Today's Reuters Gulangyu telegram said: "Most of the Japanese Marines who landed on Gulangyu withdrew last night." Needless to say, this is the result of the joint adoption of effective measures by Great Britain, the United States, and France. The only way to deal with crazy aggressors is through tough measures, because aggressors are mostly fierce on the outside but weak on the inside, especially Eastern aggressors, because of their internal contradictions—such as the opposition of elders, senior officials, steady military personnel, and some financial groups to excessive risks and separation from Great Britain, the United States, and France, while only young military personnel and representatives of the media strongly advocate being tough and reckless against third countries—they naturally cannot be reckless to the end. Cheng Yaojin's three axes can only scare the weak, but if he encounters a strong opponent, he only needs to parry a little, and he will abandon his armor and run away.</p>
<p>However, the Anglo-American-French united front against Japan cannot be temporary, it must be sustainable, because the occupation of Gulangyu is not just a local problem, but a problem related to the overall situation.</p>

<p>— Zhao Mei</p>
<p>Germany's Economy Cannot Sustain Long-Term Warfare</p>
<p>The famous American economic magazine "The Analyst" published an article analyzing in detail the economy of Fascist Germany. The magazine said:</p>
<p>"Foreign trade is a relatively weak link in the entire German economy. In 1938, Germany's imports exceeded exports by 432.4 million marks. Germany does not have sufficient gold and foreign currency reserves, and import surpluses are indeed a serious problem for Germany."</p>
<p>The magazine went on to say that acquiring Austria and the Sudetenland not only did not alleviate Germany's difficulties in foreign trade, but on the contrary, strengthened them. "It should be remembered that in 1936, Austria consumed half of its raw materials imported from abroad, while Germany only imported one-fifth of its raw materials at that time. The dependence on imported raw materials in the Sudetenland is no less than that of Austria. After acquiring Austria and the Sudetenland, Germany's food problem has become increasingly acute. Austria's agriculture can only meet 73-74 percent of the country's food consumption, while Germany's agriculture only meets 82 percent. Austria has to import 40 percent of its wheat consumption, most of its meat and other important foods. The Sudetenland is an industrial area that requires more food imports. At the same time, exports from Austria and the Sudetenland have decreased since these areas were seized by Germany." The magazine continued: "It is quite obvious that Germany cannot sustain this steady loss of trade for long." After carefully calculating Germany's gold and foreign currency reserves, the magazine concluded: "On the surface, it seems that Germany also has some slight savings, but in fact, the amount is very small and cannot compensate for the loss in foreign trade as in 1938. Germany is trying to reduce the difference between exports and imports by either reducing imports, increasing exports, or adjusting both."</p>
<p>Discussing whether Germany can reduce imports, the magazine said that if this is possible, then the main goal is to further reduce food imports, especially fats and oils. As for industrial raw materials, since the establishment of the Fascist regime, although the Fascists have shouted the so-called "Four-Year Plan," Germany's dependence on imported industrial raw materials has not only not decreased, but has also increased sharply. The magazine published an interesting statistical table showing the changes in raw material imports in Germany in the years since the establishment of the Fascist policy. If the import index in 1933 is set at 100 percent, then in 1938, Germany's imports of raw iron increased to 418 percent, non-ferrous metals increased to 154 percent, cotton increased to 83 percent, wool increased to 88 percent, leather increased to 86 percent, kerosene increased to 185 percent, flax increased to 117 percent, and rubber increased to 181 percent. "Even if it is possible to reduce the amount of imports to a certain extent, its expenditure will not decrease due to the increase in the value of raw materials in the world market."</p>
<p>"The Analyst" commented on Germany's exports, saying that the future is absolutely bleak. First, the movement to boycott German goods has intensified, especially after Germany excluded Jews. Second, competition from other countries has intensified, forcing Germany to sell its goods at low prices. Germany's trade methods have led other countries to take countermeasures. For example, the United States plans to take countermeasures against Germany's exports to South American countries. The increase in the British export fund proves that Britain intends to intensify competition. The conclusion of a new trade agreement between Britain and the United States and the fall in the market price of the pound sterling also prove to be unfavorable to German trade.</p>
<p>The magazine concluded: "Although trying to solve the difficulties may change Germany's trade, there is no doubt that the trade future will not give the Fascist German authorities comfort. The difference between Germany's exports and imports is undoubtedly a more serious threat to Germany's plan to carry out military and national defense plans with the previous level of industrial production in the future. This also explains that Germany cannot expect to fight a smooth war or conduct long-term resistance if it is subjected to economic pressure.</p>
<p>German People's Anti-Fascist Movement</p>
<p>German capital is now launching a new and unprecedented attack on the living standards and basic rights of the working class. The Fascists are preparing for war like madmen, placing the entire burden on the shoulders of the laborers, especially the workers.</p>
<p>New laws have been implemented in Germany, extending working hours in various industrial sectors to ten hours, and even to fourteen hours in "particularly important" (i.e., military and military-related industrial sectors). Of course, most industrial sectors now belong to this category. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" recently even demanded the implementation of an eighteen-hour work system.</p>
<p>Under the slogan of "rationalization," the Fascists are attacking the workers, who are waging a stubborn struggle. The Fascists are trying to extinguish this struggle with cruel terror. Strikes are prohibited, and workers who participate in strikes are severely punished. But the workers still find practical ways to oppose Fascist "rationalization," which is to reduce the speed of work. This is a secret method of striking, which is quite effective in the struggle to improve treatment.</p>
<p>Anti-Fascist newspapers published abroad are full of successes in Germany using this method. For example, a miner wrote: "In Upper Silesia, workers are actively implementing the slogan of slow work. Every kilogram of extra coal, every hour of extra work, is beneficial to the war. We don't want war."</p>
<p>The situation of workers building military defense projects is particularly difficult. Tens of thousands of workers are building fortresses on the western border of Germany. Their lives are very hard, simply terrible. Unemployed workers in Germany are well aware of the hardships of fortress work, so they refuse to work. Usually, they are forced to go. This is how it is done! The labor market notifies unemployed workers that they must report to the station at the designated time. When they arrive at the station, they are loaded onto special trains, guarded by heavy soldiers, and driven to the border. If the workers do not arrive, the police will go to his house that day, tie him up, and force him to the border.</p>
<p>Trains carrying unemployed workers to the west are called "trains for the condemned." The scene of those who are sent off saying goodbye to their relatives at the station is very tragic. Anti-Fascist demonstrations often form. Later, the Fascist stormtroopers prohibited relatives from seeing them off on the platform.</p>
<p>Many workers engaged in the construction of defense works cannot bear the harsh conditions and have fled to foreign countries or back to the interior. If they do not escape and fall into the hands of the police, then they will be押往forced into a concentration camp or shot. The prisons of Trier and Aachen are already overcrowded. Aachen is currently building a large prison.</p>
<p>Working hours for fortress engineering are no less than fourteen hours a day, and wages do not exceed the relief money for unemployed workers.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the Fascist regime is growing among all levels of the German people. The Anti-Fascist movement is surging. A large number of Anti-Fascist leaflets are being distributed in major German cities. One leaflet in Berlin wrote: "The German people do not want war. Industry should always manufacture useful goods. Raise wages! Down with Goering's food substitutes!" It is signed "German People's Front." Another leaflet distributed in Dortmund wrote: "Citizens of Dortmund! Now everyone understands: Hitler wants war. If a world war breaks out, Hitler will be the culprit. Long live the German Democratic People's Republic," signed: "Dortmund Anti-Fascists"</p>
<p>In many coal mines in Upper Silesia, a large number of such leaflets have recently been distributed: "Demand a raise in wages, don't dig a pound of coal or cast a pound of copper for war arsonists"!</p>
<p>A large number of leaflets called for aid to the Spanish people. Recently, there was also the following fact: Not long ago, Hitler went to Saarbrücken. On the night before he arrived, red slogans appeared on the windows of the local theater where Hitler would speak: "The time for reckoning has come." The police were unable to catch the person who wrote the slogans.</p>
<p>The fighting spirit of the German workers has not been destroyed. The Anti-Fascist movement is unfolding in Germany, and this movement is increasingly including more and more broad masses of workers.</p>
<p>Economic Crisis in Japan, Germany and Italy</p>
<p>The recent development of the world economic crisis in the fascist aggressor countries is adapting to the war by transforming their economies. The strong demand for military raw materials, the wars being waged in China, Spain, and Abyssinia, these situations have considerably prevented the outbreak of general overproduction. However, due to the difficulty of selling their commodities in the world market, and due to their lack of cash to purchase sufficient raw materials, the production of these countries, especially the production of non-military industries, has also been greatly reduced recently!</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>In Germany, Hitler's bandits have always been shouting that the economy under the fascist system will not suffer a crisis. Although Germany's war economy has prevented overproduction to some extent, the development of the German economy has finally reached the point where Hitler's bandits are about to be engulfed in the world economic crisis. This is first manifested in the financial crisis. The market prices of stocks in the stock exchange have been greatly reduced. Due to the renewed increase in the inheritance tax, various stocks have been sold off in large quantities. The price of the mark has been greatly reduced abroad, and Germany has embarked on the road of inflation. According to the statistics of the "New World Forum" weekly, we see the following situation: Statistics of German currency circulation (in millions of marks)</p>
<p>Circulation of Paper Money  Circulation of Coins  Total</p>
<p>December 1932  4141  1501  5642</p>
<p>December 1937  5884  1615  7499</p>
<p>June 1938  6830  1636  8466</p>
<p>This shows that the amount of currency in circulation has increased by 2824 million marks compared with before Hitler's dictatorship. Inflation inevitably reduces the purchasing power of the mark, coupled with the sharp reduction in Germany's national income, which has a serious impact on the German economy. What about Germany's foreign trade? The competition from Britain, the United States, and other countries in the world market has made it increasingly difficult to sell German goods. Just in the seven months of 1938, Germany's foreign trade had a deficit of 167 million marks. This cannot but cause overproduction of German exports. At the same time, the phenomenon of import surpluses makes Germany unable to obtain sufficient foreign currency to purchase the foreign raw materials it needs. In order to barely cope with the purchase of foreign raw materials, Germany's cash is flowing out in large quantities, so that the treasury is becoming increasingly empty.</p>
<p>It is true that the fascist madmen are boasting about their self-sufficient economy, and have set out and are carrying out their "Four-Year Plan." But what is the effect? Hitler boasted in March about the self-sufficiency of kerosene, but the amount of kerosene imports is higher than ever before. The production of artificial rubber has not reduced the import of natural rubber. The only thing that has been somewhat successful in the Four-Year Plan is the manufacture of textiles, but it can only supplement a small part of textiles. Many of the tasks in the Four-Year Plan had to be stopped due to the lack of raw materials and labor. Even the once-sensational renovation plans in Berlin and Munich had long since disappeared.</p>
<p>What about the lives of the German people? Due to the expansion of the army and military industry, and due to the hundreds of thousands of workers being held in concentration camps and prisons, the number of unemployed has "decreased," but they are trapped in a life more miserable than unemployment. Farmers' agricultural products are forcibly purchased by the government at low prices, throwing the farmers into a state of distress where they cannot survive or die. The German people under fascist rule are trapped in the hell of the Middle Ages. Hitler is frantically waging war, using such a poor economy and a people harboring strong resistance to support the war of aggression. The result will easily promote the death of fascism!</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Another fascist country—Italy is suffering even more difficult hardships than Germany. Italian capitalism is weak. It lacks important raw materials for modern industry, such as coal, iron, oil, non-ferrous metals, etc. Strong feudal remnants still exist in the country, and agriculture is relatively backward. Labor productivity is low, the general national income is low, and the domestic market is narrow. This forces Italian industry to find a way out abroad, similar to Japan. Due to the above reasons, Italian industry is already in a disadvantageous position in the world economy. In the new economic crisis, it has encountered strong competitors in the world market. In addition, its ever-expanding military industry urgently needs foreign raw materials. This has put Italy's foreign trade in a position of import surpluses. In 1937, the foreign trade deficit reached as much as 562.9 million lira. Although Italy is frantically expanding its armaments, and the expansion of the military industry accounts for a considerable proportion of Italy's industrial development, the total amount of industrial production has still decreased. Industrial production in 1937 was 117 (assuming 1928 as 100), while in 1938 it decreased to 105. Production in some industrial sectors (such as the non-ferrous metal industry) decreased by 25 percent (see International Communication Issue 42). The Italian currency, the lira, is also trending towards devaluation. In October 1936, under Mussolini's decree to "restore the old value ratio with the US dollar," the lira was devalued by another 42 percent!</p>
<p>Perhaps Mussolini boasts that he occupied Abyssinia without hindrance, but the occupation of Abyssinia not only did not solve the problem of lack of sales and raw materials, not only did not strengthen the situation of Italian capitalists, but on the contrary, weakened and complicated it. In order to suppress the persistent resistance of the Abyssinian people, and in order to develop the resources there, Italy still has to spend a lot of money up to now. The funds for developing Abyssinia in 1937, according to a speech by the Italian Minister of Finance on May 18, 1938, totaled 175 million lira. According to calculations by the British "New Finance" magazine, Italy still has to pay 400 million lira in military expenses every month after "ending" the Abyssinian war, reducing Italy's cash and endangering the stability of the lira. In addition to the huge expenditure on Abyssinia, the war of aggression against Spain also greatly consumed the Italian economy, yielding nothing in return. Mussolini has never announced his expenses for the invasion of Spain. According to calculations by the "New Finance" magazine, in addition to the expenses for supplying Franco, Italy also has to spend about 150 million military expenses every month in the Spanish war, which is also a loss that cannot be compensated. Italy's frantic military expansion, the heroic resistance of Spain, and the persistent guerrilla warfare in Abyssinia will exhaust the Italian economy. Although Mussolini arrogantly boasts that Italy is a first-class military power, and although he seeks a way out in the war of aggression, this can only intimidate some ignorant weaklings, attempting to divert the Italian people's attention to foreign countries in order to alleviate the anti-fascist struggle. Italy's increasingly weak economy cannot sustain a long-term large-scale war.</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>Japan: Japan is the most barbaric and at the same time the poorest of the aggressor camp. Japan's industrial production was stimulated by a strong armament expansion, increasing from 91 in 1931 (assuming 1929 as 100) to 171 in 1937, which has reached its peak. In February 1938, its industrial production had already been reduced by 16 percent. Due to our country's persistent resistance and due to the widespread outrage caused by Japan's brutality in the world, a general boycott of Japanese goods broke out everywhere. Therefore, foreign trade, which is one of the main sources of Japan's income, was greatly hit and turned into a state of import surpluses. According to the statistics of the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun," Japan's foreign trade deficit from January to July 1937 was 720 million yen, and the deficit in the same period in 1938 was 188.6 million. The reason for the decrease in the deficit in 1938 was that Japan lacked foreign currency, so it had to strongly control the import and use of foreign raw materials. This exposed Japan's financial exhaustion and its greater economic difficulties. The extreme lack of raw materials has made the production of non-military industries more severely reduced. In industrial sectors such as textiles, silk weaving, rayon, and paper making, 55 percent of the machines have been shut down. Imported raw materials are only allowed to be used in the manufacture of exports and in military industries. The war of aggression against our country and the foreign trade deficit have forced Japan's cash to flow out in large quantities, thereby reducing Japan's treasury cash and also affecting the sharp drop in the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialist war of aggression against our country has greatly consumed Japan's finances. The special budget for the war against China in 1938-39 was 4.85 billion yen, and the budget for the war against China in 1939-40 was 5 billion yen. But this only refers to the announced budget. The unannounced and indirect expenses for the war must also be an alarming number. In the process of our people's persistent resistance until the final victory, this huge war expenditure will make Japan's finances even poorer and even collapse. This huge expenditure can only be raised through two channels. One is to issue foreign debt. Borrow from its allies—the German and Italian fascists? The dictators of these two countries are racking their brains to seek foreign debt and cannot get it, and they can only feel "helpless" to Japan. Borrow from the wealthy United States and Britain? The interests of these two countries in China, especially Britain's interests in South China, have been ravaged by Japanese imperialism. In this way, the United States and Britain certainly have no great interest in lending money to Japan and helping it to promote its infringement on its own interests. On the contrary, it also forces capitalist countries such as the United States and Britain to provide assistance to our resistance. The loans from the United States and Britain to us not long ago are just the beginning of assistance. The second is to issue domestic debt and increase taxes, but this will inevitably lead to greater impoverishment of the Japanese people and greater exhaustion of Japanese finances, causing the Japanese people to fight against the Japanese warlords. Seventeen months of the war of aggression have trapped the Japanese people in great suffering. Once this heavy burden exceeds the saturation point that the Japanese people can tolerate, under the leadership of the Japanese People's Front, the Japanese people and soldiers will one day overthrow the reactionary government and establish a Japanese People's Democratic Republic. Japan's internal difficulties will increase with the increasing persistence of our resistance, as Mr. Mao Zedong said, it is one of the elements of our country's final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Our Nation's New Wartime Inventions <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Since the start of the War of Resistance, our compatriots in the rear have redoubled their efforts in production and construction, resulting in a series of new industrial products. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has established a Committee for the Review of Industrial Technology Awards, which began registering inventions last year. To date, at least twenty new inventions have been reviewed and approved, each granted a three-year patent to encourage diligence. With the exception of those related to military affairs, which will be omitted, the various inventions are listed below:</p>
<p>Literacy Machine: Invented by Zhou Yin, this machine consists of mechanisms such as a handle, gears, and rollers. Its purpose is to facilitate literacy, greatly benefiting literacy efforts and popular education. It also includes a rotating literacy record table and an incentive savings box, which can stimulate children's interest in saving and increase literacy effectiveness.</p>
<p>Active Fountain Pen Brush: Invented by Li Yiren, its external appearance is similar to an ordinary fountain pen. Its internal structure includes a spiral water channel, an ink-adjusting needle, and a hollow double-layered pen tip, which are absent in general fountain pen brushes on the market.</p>
<p>Elliptical Dual-Purpose Compass: Invented by Nie Shuxiang, this compass has three legs: A, B, and C. Legs B and C are the same as the two legs of an ordinary compass. However, leg A is above leg B and can move up and down and rotate left and right to draw circles. This is constructed using the principle of a cylinder intersecting a plane at an angle.</p>
<p>Type Case: Invented by Mr. Chen, the case is a sloping surface constructed with multi-layered sloping type trays. The sliding, upright types utilize the tilting sliding force of lightweight objects, causing each ready-to-use type to automatically appear in front of the typesetter, increasing work efficiency, reducing labor, and reducing the space occupied by printing houses, benefiting cultural and journalistic endeavors.</p>
<p>Calendar Clock: Invented by Shi Yongen, in addition to the function of an ordinary clock displaying the time, it also automatically displays the day, week, month, and year. The leap years and the varying lengths of months are automatically adjusted, providing accurate indications, and its structure is different from those invented by predecessors.</p>
<p>Open-Suction Electromagnetic Control Switch: Invented by the Hua Sheng Electric Factory, it uses the principle of electromagnetic attraction to turn lights on and off. Although the principle and general structure have many applications, the switch's latch, jumper, and moving contact parts have a particularly novel and practical design.</p>
<p>Fan: Invented by Shu Minghai, after careful comparison, the fan blades are indeed different from the structure of ordinary electric fans, providing another tool for escaping the summer heat.</p>
<p>Self-Feeding Solder Iron: Invented by Li Ganmin, it consists of an iron cylinder with a circular solder-melting container. The outside of the cylinder is wrapped with a coil. When current is passed through, the cylinder's surroundings heat up, and the solder melts and accumulates inside the cylinder, making it more convenient than ordinary soldering irons.</p>
<p>Sitting Tricycle: Invented by Huang Shidian, in addition to an ordinary tricycle, it has a steel-framed canvas bed surface. If the tricycle is disassembled, its parts can be used to convert it into a bed frame, and the canvas bed surface can be installed, forming a bed that can be used for sleeping, rescue, and other purposes.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Fare Calculator: Invented by Cai Shunfu, this automatic device has four parts: mileage, fare record, rotation control, and lighting. It uses a combination of various mechanisms to calculate the rickshaw's mileage and fare, which is quite convenient. (Guoxin News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Japanese Prisoners of War Receive Preferential Treatment; Voluntarily Offer Services to Our Cause; Deeply Regret Being Deceived and Helping the Japanese in China; Willing to Promote an Early End to the War of Aggression <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Today, local and foreign reporters in the city interviewed 22 prisoners of war recently brought from the [number redacted]th War Zone. The prisoners were all dressed in gray uniforms, sitting on mats as if they were in their own country. After greeting the reporters, a medium-sized man stood up. After inquiry, he was identified as a Captain, named Susumu Ue, from Hiroshima City, 33 years old, of a Japanese army transport unit. Although this Captain and the other 21 men belonged to different units, they all regarded him as their leader because of his higher rank and longer association with them. He introduced to the reporters that some were infantry, and some were artillery. Among them, Kazuo Takaki, a 21-year-old mechanic, was the most innocent and sincere. According to him, he was from Hyogo Prefecture and worked as a worker in an engine assembly plant before enlisting, earning 3 yuan and 33 cents a day. His parents are still alive, and he has no siblings. He was ordered by the factory owner to enlist, which was slightly different from ordinary soldiers. After being captured, he received preferential treatment from our army and had nothing but gratitude to express. In addition, Tatsumatsu Morikawa and Nagashi Takahashi, both 35 years old, belonged to the 104th Regiment of the 13th Division and were both of peasant origin. Their speech was straightforward. However, the more educated one was still Captain Ue. He recently wrote a reflection, which stated that when he was ordered to come to China, he was deceived by the warlords who claimed that China had become communist and that their arrival was to fight the communists. It was only after arriving in China that he learned that the actual situation was different from what the warlords had said. After being captured, Chinese officers, soldiers, and intellectuals all showed sympathy, which moved him to tears of gratitude. In the future, he deeply desires to dedicate his skills to China in order to repay this kindness and promote an early end to the war so that all can share the joy of equality and happiness.</p>
<h3 id="e8">US Fleet Commander to Take Office in Shanghai <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Shanghai news: The new US Asia Fleet Commander, Admiral Hart, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 18th to take office. The current commander, Admiral Yarnell, is scheduled to return to the United States at the end of June.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Naval Landings by Britain, America, and France on Gulangyu; Express Determination to Uphold Far East Interests; Japanese Marines Retreat in Disappointment <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Gulangyu, 18th] Two hundred Japanese naval personnel landed on Gulangyu last week. Only forty-two remain on the island. At 6 PM on Tuesday, approximately 150 British, American, and French naval personnel landed on Gulangyu. This action followed an ultimatum issued to the Japanese by British Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, Admiral Noble, which stated that if the Japanese did not withdraw from Gulangyu, the British, American, and French navies would conduct a landing. Noble also stated that the administrative organization of Gulangyu could not be changed. Currently, many warships from various countries are concentrated here, including the British cruiser HMS Birmingham, destroyers HMS Duncan, HMS Protector, and HMS Scout, the US cruiser USS Marblehead, destroyer USS Barker, and the French cruiser HMS Borde.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] The Navy Department issued a public announcement today stating that after the Japanese Navy Marines landed on Gulangyu in China, marines from the British, French, and American navies also landed at the same location today. The number of personnel is equal to that of the Japanese troops, it said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied to Britain regarding the protest against the Japanese Navy landing on Gulangyu. This reply was delivered to the British Embassy here last night. However, the content has not been disclosed.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, New York, 18th] Various newspapers commented that the landing of US sailors in Xiamen is the United States' first level of attention to its Far East policy. They also said that the sending of sailors to Gulangyu by Britain and America proves the joint expression of Britain and America to safeguard their interests in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 18th] On Wednesday afternoon, 42 British and 42 American sailors landed on Gulangyu. British Naval Far East Commander Noble has arrived in the concession. It is heard that the landing of British and American sailors is an attempt to prevent the Japanese army from interfering with the administration of the concession again. According to the Thursday's agricultural report, the sailors of the British cruiser Birmingham waited until the US warship USS Marblehead arrived from Qingdao before landing together. A French warship also sent 42 sailors ashore, united in protecting the interests of Britain, America, and France in Xiamen.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] When the Japanese Navy spokesperson answered questions about the situation in Gulangyu, he acknowledged that before the Japanese Navy landed, there had been no attacks on Japanese residents, nor had any Japanese property been damaged. However, he said that the Japanese Navy authorities considered the landing of marines on Gulangyu to be "a necessary emergency self-defense measure." He also said that the development of the situation did not require the British, American, and French naval authorities to take the same action. He said he could not understand why the Japanese Navy's actions in Gulangyu had caused so much disturbance to foreign countries.</p>

<p>Sixth, labor and capital must cooperate to improve production discipline. Today, both entrepreneurs and workers are producing and laboring for the country. At this time of national crisis, both labor and capital must cooperate in spirit, help each other, and cooperate in division of labor, which is the basic principle of modern undertakings. Not only should there be absolute cooperation between labor and capital, but all people, whether officials or entrepreneurs, whether technicians or workers, should advance in different ways under strict self-consciousness, each doing their best to give full play to the spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance. At the same time, in production undertakings, we must establish a spirit of discipline and the rule of law. We must thoroughly break with the evils of favoritism, nepotism, monopolization, and corruption. We must appoint capable, talented, responsible, and hardworking individuals to establish a spirit of rapid, accurate, capable, and long-term service, and a pure spirit of enterprise that is selfless, meticulous, unplayful, and untiring. This spirit must permeate every state-owned or privately-owned enterprise, demonstrating a strict discipline and a good atmosphere. The above six points can be summarized in eight words: increase production and reduce consumption. This is the fundamental principle of livelihood during the war. We must base ourselves on these two major principles to meet the military needs of the War of Resistance and establish a foundation for an equitable livelihood. By advancing from this, we will be able to achieve a balanced and rational development of public and private industries after the war and obtain national prosperity and happiness, completing the great mission of building the country based on the Three Principles of the People. The bright future of our country is already in sight. However, the success of all great undertakings depends on our extraordinary efforts. We must drive out the brutal Japanese and achieve national prosperity. We must always remember two words: "diligence and thrift." Diligence and thrift are inherent virtues of our nation and the fundamental basis of modern prosperity. The ancients said, "Livelihood lies in encouragement, and diligence will not lead to scarcity." Diligence means hard work. Entrepreneurs, workers, and technicians must not be afraid of hardship, constantly strive, and constantly create. Thrift means hard work and frugality. The ancients said, "Those who produce are many, those who consume are few, those who work are quick, and those who use are slow, then wealth is always sufficient." A few people creating wealth, and many people sharing it, with the latest consumption on the oldest production, is the root of national poverty and popular hardship, and it is also a disgrace to our spirit. The danger the country faces today is due to our past insufficient promotion of diligence and thrift. We have thousands of years of education, and the current national crisis is also a time of war of survival, we must endure hardships beyond the ordinary in order to preserve the heritage of our ancestors and to build a strong foundation for our descendants. Prosperity is the goal of our material construction, and diligence and thrift are the foundation of our spiritual mobilization. With spirit and matter complementing each other, we can resist the war, build the country, and continue the past and open up the future, completing the great mission of building the country based on the Three Principles of the People. I wish you all efforts and success. (The end)</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 18th] According to Reuters reporters, the United States' reply to Japan's request to revise the "Land Regulations" is a blunt refusal. The reply even demands that the Japanese return the concession north of the Suzhou Creek, which they occupy, to the management of the Public Works Department. This reply was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry by US Ambassador to Japan Grew yesterday. The reply states that the proposal to revise the "Land Regulations" cannot be discussed until the situation is completely stable. Under the current special circumstances caused by Japan's invasion of China, it is difficult to reach a satisfactory agreement. The letter warns Japan not to abuse this special situation caused by the general situation and to infiltrate the disputes in the concession, saying that the US government is willing to conduct friendly and reasonable negotiations to revise the "Land Regulations," but the current situation is special and certainly not the time. The letter also points out that the Public Works Department's performance of its duties is greatly hindered by illegal activities in the neighboring concession area, and the Japanese refusal to return Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Huishan to the management of the Public Works Department is an even more difficult knot. Finally, the letter states that Shanghai is a large city, and any attempt to change its status quo will involve many countries.</p>

The readers are all workers, and then the patrolmen swept the road one by one, and all kinds of leaflets were taken back to the Bureau of Industry and Translation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai External News, although the Japanese spokesman claimed that the five Chinese arrested by the Japanese Gendarmerie in the Public Concession a few days ago have been released, the results of investigations by various newspapers here are purely inaccurate.

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech the day before yesterday, stating that in view of the Japanese aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Chongqing and major cities across the country, large-scale and strict population evacuations should be initiated to strengthen the spirit of resistance and increase rural production, Chongqing's new mayor, He Guoguang, has drafted the following plans to comply with the leader's instructions to cope with the future:</p>
<p>(1) Survey Chongqing's population;</p>
<p>(2) Build firebreak alleys;</p>
<p>(3) Conduct resident registration to determine who should be evacuated;</p>
<p>(4) Reorganize various service teams and cooperate uniformly with the Garrison Headquarters. It is reported that, except for resident registration, which will take a long time, other plans can be completed immediately. In addition to actively evacuating the population, the municipal government is also cooperating with the Chamber of Commerce to limit the prices of daily necessities because prices have been rising since the Japanese aircraft bombings. Food prices are to be determined by a committee, and those who intentionally speculate and sabotage will be severely punished. Furthermore, Chongqing's air defense capabilities have been greatly enhanced, and many air raid shelters and anti-aircraft gun emplacements have been added. Government agencies, schools, and hospitals have almost all moved to the suburbs. Major financial institutions and banks have also established offices outside the city. In the bombed areas, businesses have not yet resumed operations and mostly want to find land outside the city to operate. According to reports from various locations, major cities in Sichuan Province have also been ordered to evacuate, and more than half of the residents of densely populated cities have experienced relocation, so the villages near the cities are extremely crowded. Local governments are now focusing on maintaining transportation, stabilizing prices, and relocating handicrafts and various factories from dangerous areas within the bombed cities. Therefore, rural areas occupy an important position in wartime production. According to police reports, order is well-maintained everywhere, and the prosperity of the villages within a hundred miles around Chongqing is unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Declaration of the Production Conference <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Agricultural and Industrial Cooperation</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about industry. The previous article discussed agricultural policies, and the coordination of agriculture and industry will be the main focus of our country's agricultural policies in the future. To increase the supply of raw materials, the industrial sector should assist in the improvement and marketing of agricultural products. To easily sell products at good prices, the agricultural sector should adapt to the needs of the industrial sector. If the production and needs of agriculture and industry can be closely linked, then neither side will lack usable raw materials nor suffer from product stagnation. The two industries will complement each other, and all undertakings will prosper. The victory or defeat of modern warfare depends on the competition of sustained human, material, and financial resources. Under today's circumstances, to develop industry and achieve the established policies, we must consider the actual situation to determine the order of priority and urgency. We must also correct past shortcomings to reduce development resistance, and then we can strengthen the resistance and lay the foundation for national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Speaking of China's industrial construction today, it must aim to accelerate wartime production. To achieve this goal, there should be a sound and strict control mechanism in terms of organization. In terms of management, we should follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the central government's policies. Heavy and basic industries related to national defense should be state-owned in principle, while other industries, large and small, should be privately owned in principle, and the government should supervise, encourage, and assist them. Only in this way can we develop in an orderly manner to promote wartime industrial production and establish the foundation for post-war industry. To encourage production and protect private businesses, the government should adopt a fairly lenient policy unless absolutely necessary. The southwestern and northwestern provinces are extremely rich in agricultural and mineral resources, which are inexhaustible. The conditions for industrial construction are naturally available. To build China's new industry, we should first pay attention to the development of these vast natural resources to increase the supply of raw materials, so that national defense and people's livelihood industries can both advance at an accelerated pace. In a relatively short period of time, we can establish a strong new industry.</p>
<p>Future Direction</p>
<p>Building industry is not just about developing resources. We must also build various industrial centers according to the regional distribution of various natural resources, implement regional specialization, and advance simultaneously to achieve the effect of adapting to local conditions. The establishment of each industrial center must consider its transportation conditions, investigate its resource abundance, study its needs, and weigh the three to serve as the standard for construction. The allocation and planning of various industrial products can also be based on this to make reasonable and reliable decisions. Building industry is not just about focusing on heavy industry and large industry. The construction of national industry must take self-sufficiency as its ultimate goal. China's industrial foundation is weak, and national reconstruction should have comprehensive and long-term plans without biased and negligent mistakes. Not only should light industry and small industry not be neglected, but also rural side occupations and family handicrafts should be vigorously promoted, hoping to accumulate little by little to make up for the shortcomings of heavy industry and large industry. Moreover, most large industries cannot be completed in a short period of time, and the trend of modern industry is to emphasize decentralization to avoid wartime damage. China's original rural industry should not be allowed to wither but should be supported and improved. In addition to major industrial construction, the links between various industries and the industries between various industries should also be constructed to achieve the effect of coordination and maneuverability. Industrial experiments and industrial surveys must also be carried out with attention to achieve the effect of continuous improvement. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Women and Children in Shanxi Province Being Mobilized <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Xin</p>
<p>[People's Revolutionary Society, Fenxi Correspondence] This is one of the most culturally backward and transportationally isolated areas. In the past, the vast majority of women were mired in a miserable and enslaved life. They were treated as commodities to be sold. The systems of child brides and infanticide meant that women were treated inhumanely from a young age. From cities to villages, women suffered the "torment" of foot-binding from a young age. They never had the opportunity to receive education, and they themselves never even had the thought of studying. They were tied down all day by their husbands, children, and trivial matters, until they fell ill, grew old, and died. Children also faced the most tragic fate. Most poor children had no opportunity to study at all. From a very young age, they did the same heavy work and labor as adults.</p>
<p>However, since the flames of the war of resistance began to burn in the East, in the West, and throughout the war zone, this backward situation has changed under the new circumstances. Just as all young and middle-aged people began to mobilize for the war of resistance, women and children also began to be widely organized and received general education and training. Women's National Salvation Associations and Children's National Salvation Associations appeared in every extremely remote and isolated corner. The clear banner of striving for national liberation was raised high everywhere by them. Their tragic and solemn songs of national salvation echoed in every corner, rippling through the vast countryside and mountains.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Shanxi Public Relief Hongzhao Central District, in October of last year, 830 Women's National Salvation Associations had been established in this anti-Japanese base area in western Shanxi, with 36,228 members. The total number of Children's National Salvation Associations established was 1,142, with a total of 28,521 innocent children united around it. Moreover, the organization of these groups is expanding day by day. Since being organized, most of them have received organizational training, and they are divided into small groups, living a regular collective life.</p>
<p>In general, the work of the Women's National Salvation Association often includes the following: 1. Educating and organizing women, publicizing the harms of foot-binding, and pulling them from their homes to the meeting place to participate in this sacred war; 2. Persuading their children to go to the front line, writing letters of comfort, etc., to encourage the soldiers on the front line. They also often call on and sew and wash clothes for the soldiers on the front line; 3. Expanding production in the rear, strengthening the power of resistance, raising livestock, and helping with the harvesting and cultivation of fields; 4. Organizing women's self-defense teams. In many areas, women's self-defense teams have been organized. They not only receive training like male self-defense teams but also stand guard and watch the fields like men, checking passersby. When people pass by, the female self-defense team members holding large knives will ask you to show your "road pass." During the busy farming season, they shout the slogan "Husbands go to plow, wives watch for them." Unfortunately, due to the difficulty in quickly changing feudal ideas and the lack of female work cadres, women's self-defense teams have not yet been widely developed. 5. Establishing administrative conferences at all levels in various districts to give the people freedom to participate in politics. In the elections in various places, the Women's National Salvation Association also actively participated in electing their representatives. This work also reflects the weaknesses above and cannot become more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Friends holding the torch of resistance are also enthusiastically doing the work they can do. Even very young children can sing many anti-Japanese songs. "Japan is our ×××" "The final victory is ours!" are deeply imprinted on children's minds. I once asked a twelve-year-old child, "What is a united front?" He naturally said, "Chinese people, regardless of party affiliation, rich or poor, men or women, old or young, unite to defeat ×××××." They often stand at the village entrance with broadswords, responsible for guarding. Walking around western Shanxi, you can see the traces of these little heroes everywhere. Their very serious attitude is very moving. Many children only ten years old have used rifles for target practice. Once, a reporter asked a "little soldier" guarding Nuanquantou in Fenxi: "If a big traitor comes, you can't kill him with a knife, what will you do?" He innocently said, "Let a child go to report to the army. I'll cut off his legs first. When his legs are broken, he has to lie down, and then I'll cut off his ××××." Later, I asked him, and he was only eleven years old.</p>
<p>Many heroic women and children resolutely joined the ranks of the regular army. The Cao Cheng Brigade, which belongs to the Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps, originally had an army that was entirely "female soldiers," and they were all armed rural women. Later, because of the inconvenience of marching, they were persuaded to be dispersed into the Shanxi Political Security Team. Children accounted for several hundred of the number. In other troops, there were also "little soldiers" of fourteen or fifteen years old who had been fighting for a long time. The Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps headquarters also has a women and children's team.</p>
<p>In the Dare-to-Die Corps, there are four or five drama troupes, and children account for a considerable proportion of them. In Zhao City, Hongdong, Puxian, Fenxi, and other counties, there is a "Women and Children's Work Team." They everywhere raise tragic songs and perform vernacular dramas for the common people to watch, doing in-depth propaganda and mobilization work, pulling thousands of people from a state of chaos to the path of resolute war of resistance.</p>
<p>The great anti-Japanese force accumulated among women and children has begun to be widely mobilized. Although this mobilization still has many weaknesses today, it has already exerted a great force and has given many persecutions to Japanese invaders and traitors!</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Labour MP Leslie asked in the House of Commons today that, in view of the government's declared policy of resisting aggression, will the British representative attending the League of Nations meeting propose an embargo and ban the sale of all minerals and gasoline to Japan that Japan relies on to invade China? Undersecretary Butler replied that the Chinese government's request had been included in the agenda of the current League of Nations Council meeting. The issue will be discussed by the Council as a whole. It is not possible to make predictions at this time. Leslie also asked, "What instructions will the British government give to the British representative attending the League of Nations?" Butler refused to announce, only saying that Foreign Secretary Halifax would personally attend the meeting. Leslie also asked, "Has the Undersecretary noticed that a large amount of tungsten is currently being shipped from Canada to Japan? Is this not the time when action needs to be taken?" Butler said that the government would undoubtedly consider it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] At the House of Commons meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, Liberal MP Mendel asked whether the Prime Minister intends to ask the League of Nations to negotiate with the Japanese government regarding the repeated bombing of Chongqing City and other places in China by Japanese aircraft, which has resulted in the tragic massacre of ordinary people. Undersecretary Butler replied that the League of Nations General Assembly had passed a resolution condemning this bombing method, saying that it was contrary to human conscience and various principles of international law. The British government has also made serious representations to Japan yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Labour MP Macmillan asked whether the government had accepted Japan's proposal to conclude a long-term non-aggression pact.

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question that the Anglo-Turkish Declaration established on the 20th of this month did not change the Montreux Convention regarding Turkish protection of the Dardanelles. Besides the UK and Turkey, other countries participated in the treaty. The content of the Anglo-Turkish Declaration did not prevent the two governments from cooperating with other Mediterranean countries in the event of an aggressive war in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the British government is prepared to cooperate not only with Turkey but also with other countries related to the Mediterranean to jointly maintain peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. The British Cabinet has passed a new reply to the Soviet Union, which will become the basis for the Soviet Union to join the anti-aggression front. It is said that after the cabinet meeting, the British Prime Minister informed the Soviet Ambassador of the content of the British reply. After some diplomatic formalities with the Soviet Embassy, the UK will send the reply immediately.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th] The center of political interest in London is now focused on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The British government's decision to promptly submit a reply to the Soviet Union is sufficient to prove its desire to establish some kind of concrete agreement. British foreign policy is based on the system of concluding agreements and providing guarantees. If the Anglo-Soviet negotiations fail to succeed, the impact can be known. Even the Anglo-Turkish agreement will lose its meaning if the Soviet Union does not join. The opposition in the government is eagerly hoping that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations will be successfully concluded, otherwise, the British political authorities will be further attacked by the opposition. Even the opinions of the Conservative Party believe that the key to Chamberlain's future lies in the development of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th] Chamberlain's future is now tied to the success or failure of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The government's supporters are fully aware of the importance of these negotiations. If these negotiations fail, the opposition will be able to obtain the best opportunity to attack, and Chamberlain's position is in deep danger. It is generally believed that Chamberlain's unwillingness to conclude a military agreement with the Soviet Union is not out of fear of the disagreement of small countries, but out of his traditional unwillingness to leak British military secrets to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 17th] Regarding the negotiations between the UK, France, and the Soviet Union to form an anti-aggression group, according to responsible sources here, Foreign Minister Bonnet has telegraphed Ambassador Corbin in the UK to submit new proposals to the British government.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] People from the Balkan countries here recently announced that while the UK and the Soviet Union are negotiating collective security issues, the Soviet Union and Turkey have already secretly concluded an agreement with extremely broad content, stipulating: (1) Any act of aggression that undermines the status quo in the Balkans shall be jointly resisted by the Soviet Union and Turkey; (2) In the event of war, the Soviet Union and Turkey shall merge all resources and forces in order to cope with it together. The land forces of the two countries shall be under the unified command of Turkish generals, and the air forces of the two countries shall be under the unified command of Soviet generals. The Soviet Navy is responsible for protecting the safety of the Black Sea, and the Turkish Navy shall join the British and Greek navies to protect the safety of the Eastern Mediterranean. In addition, the Soviet Union and Turkey promise to transfer the defense forces of the two countries stationed in the Caucasus Mountains to the Black Sea coast at any time when necessary, so that they can be transported to the Balkans at any time. The Soviet government also requires Turkey to restrict the passage of warships from various countries through the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. In other words, except for countries that have concluded non-aggression pacts with the Soviet Union, warships from other countries are not allowed to pass through these straits. It is reported that Arab countries have expressed their support for the agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and Turkey.</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Palestine Question: Britain Announces New Policy – Plans to Build an Independent State Within Ten Years – Hopes Parliament Will Pass It <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The British government has released a White Paper outlining its policy on Palestine. The British government plans to establish an independent Palestinian state within ten years, maintaining treaty relations with Britain to satisfy the commercial and strategic needs of both countries. In the future, Jews and Arabs in the new state government will share administrative power according to their population size. During the transitional period, the number of Jewish and Arab seats in the government will be increased. Jewish immigration will be limited to no more than one-third of the total population. In the next five years, Jewish immigration will not exceed 10,000 per year, plus 25,000 refugees. After five years, no further immigration will be allowed without the consent of the Arabs. Jewish representatives criticized the White Paper, saying, "The new policy virtually deprives Jews of the right to rebuild their homeland and transfers power to the majority of Arabs. The Jews believe that this British move is a 'breach of faith.' At this time of extreme suffering, Britain's suggestion to destroy the last hope of the Jews is a cruel blow."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent reports that various parties hold different views regarding the proposal to reorganize Palestine. The government hopes that it will be passed by a majority in the meeting, but it is also expected to be criticized by the opposition.</p>
<p>Britain's Aim: To Remove Anxiety</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, the British government's purpose in issuing a declaration on the Palestine issue is to quell the anxieties and beliefs that are the major cause of the disturbances in Palestine. This policy will be criticized by both sides, but it is believed that this proposal can still be regarded as a fair solution because the obligations of sacrifice are equal for Jews and Arabs. The British government has compromised on the extreme demands of both Jews and Arabs and decided to adopt an independent state so that both sides can share governmental responsibilities while serving common interests. The establishment of this new state can be completed through consultations with the League of Nations without the need for a mandatory decision, and the unification can be achieved. The White Paper specifies a plan to protect foreign interests, especially those of American missionaries. As for the decision to allow 25,000 immigrants and refugees, including 10,000 children, this plan will be approved by the League of Nations and the Permanent Mandates Commission. It is reported that it will be discussed around June and then passed by the League of Nations. The White Paper will be discussed in the Lower House next Monday and Wednesday, and Colonial Secretary MacDonald will explain it. Arab figures here have expressed great disappointment with this plan, believing that the deadline for establishing the state should be at most within three years, arguing that this delay in independence not only violates Arab interests but also the interests of the general public, thus preventing Palestine from reaching the goal of an Arab Federation.</p>
<p>Rumors of a Jewish Strike Brewing</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] According to reports from Jerusalem today, Jews are currently brewing a major strike to protest the British government's White Paper. Zionist activists have announced three points as an organized opposition to the White Paper, but they stated that they will never resort to force. The three points are: (1) Vow not to cooperate with the British government's policies and refuse to serve a political system in which Jews are a minority. (2) Expand political activities to influence the Lower House's debate on the White Paper, so that the League of Nations Mandate extends to the Palestine Committee. (3) Actively promote construction work within Palestine to establish Jewish rights in Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] Fifteen hundred Jewish demonstrators attacked the local government office yesterday, vandalizing its interior and setting it on fire. A Jewish policeman was seriously injured. Several bombs were placed in the upper levels of the Jerusalem government immigration department, causing a large fire. Two Jewish constables suffered minor injuries. Most Jews do not approve of the riotous behavior and advocate for the declaration of the Jewish Congress opposing the British government's White Paper. It is believed that the public may adopt a method of passive resistance similar to that of Gandhi.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] According to powerful diplomatic sources, the only condition of Mussolini's recent military agreement with Hitler was that Hitler must resolve disputes with Poland peacefully and not resort to force. Hitler also agreed at the time and expressed his conviction that the German-Polish and German-French issues could be resolved without war. Foreign diplomats have apparently received assurances that Germany and Italy have no intention of initiating conflict, so they have not expressed alarm at the conclusion of the military agreement between Germany and Italy. According to people close to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the procedures for the conclusion of the German-Italian military alliance have been completed and are in the final stage of signing. Its content goes beyond the original intention of a purely defensive agreement and includes a formal military alliance sufficient to encourage and express the will of the two countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 16th] In view of the tension in the Free City of Danzig, the government authorities have taken various preventive measures to deal with Germany's future actions. Armored trains have been traveling back and forth on the railway from the northern end of the Polish Corridor, the city of Gdynia, to the province of Pomerania, transporting troops every day. However, there is no definite destination. The authorities intend to continue this mobilization so that Polish troops regularly pass through Danzig and stay in the city as much as possible. Sometimes, due to damage to the armored train machinery, they stop for repairs. All of this is done to prevent any eventuality and to make the residents of Danzig understand that if Germany were to send troops to occupy the city, there would be various difficulties in terms of military strategy, as the city is only connected to the German province of East Prussia by a single line that must pass through Polish territory.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] During today's meeting of the British House of Commons, Labour MP Mr. Leach asked whether the trafficking of Chinese children in Hong Kong and Malaya still exists and whether the government has paid attention to the statement by Mr. Oakley, Deputy Secretary for Chinese Affairs in Selangor, that selling children is not a crime under local law. Colonial Secretary MacDonald replied that the government has noted the remarks on the matter in a certain newspaper, stating that the trafficking of children with the intention of enslaving them as prostitutes or for other immoral and illegal acts is prohibited by the laws of Hong Kong and Malaya. The Hong Kong and Malaya Domestic Servants Committee recently conducted a thorough investigation into any system of transferring children prevalent in the two regions, but according to the report, there is no system of buying and selling under the pretext of adoption or other reasons. Recently, many Chinese children have been taken to Malaya, but it is believed that they are refugees fleeing from war zones. The government has now taken steps to ensure that the governments of Hong Kong and Malaya cooperate with each other to prevent abuses from occurring, and if the circumstances require it, special management legislation will be enacted.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee held a closed-door meeting on the 16th to discuss revisions to the Neutrality Law. A representative from the Department of Commerce attended the meeting and explained the impact of the current Neutrality Law on U.S. commerce during wartime. Although the authorities are keeping it secret, according to well-informed sources, the acting chairman of the committee, Mr. Bloom, has submitted a draft of the new Neutrality Law that has been endorsed by the State Department. The content is similar to the bill previously proposed by Democratic Senator Gillette, advocating that the President be authorized to designate any country as an aggressor and designate a certain area as a danger zone in the event of international war, and that U.S. citizens and ships are not allowed to go there to engage in commerce, otherwise all risks should be borne by themselves. In this way, the United States can continue to supply arms to certain belligerent countries without the government having to compensate for accidental losses. However, when the committee discussed the case today, the debate was fierce and the meeting had to be adjourned. It is generally expected that Mr. Bloom will have to draft a compromise proposal and submit it for discussion again.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Quebec, 18th] The British King and Queen were warmly received at the government banquet today. The evening's welcome program included a large fireworks display, watched by thousands of people. The British King and Queen left for Montreal at 9:19 a.m. (local time) today and are expected to arrive at approximately 2:15 p.m., and will depart for Ottawa at 11:00 p.m. Newspapers in Canada, the United States, and France have criticized the welcome the British King and Queen received in Quebec. A "New York Times" correspondent stationed in Quebec said, "If the British King and Queen can receive such a warm welcome in British Canada and the United States, they will have completed the primary goal of this trip, which is to conquer North America. "The Kingston "Standard" said, "A new conquest of Canada has taken place on the Plains of Abraham."</p>
<p>Grand Welcome in Quebec</p>
<p>[Reuters, Quebec, 18th] Yesterday, the British King performed the duties of the King of Canada for the first time and formally approved the U.S. government's appointment of Mr. Roberts as the ambassador to Canada.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Quebec, 17th] The "Empress of Australia" has arrived here. When the British King and Queen appeared on the deck of the ship, the crowds on the shore cheered wildly. The British King wore a naval admiral's uniform, and the Queen wore a gray-white dress. Escorting warships were lined up in the middle of the river. Minutes after the "Empress of Australia" dropped anchor, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie boarded the ship to welcome them. The British King and Queen landed at 3:38 p.m. (British Standard Time), and military horns sounded loudly, and Governor-General Besborough fired a 21-gun salute to pay tribute. The escorting warships also fired salutes in return. Among the audience gathered on the riverbank, some used telescopes, and others stood on the cliffs regardless of the danger. After the British King and Queen shook hands with the welcoming dignitaries, they were led to a platform to meet with Canadian cabinet members and many celebrities, and then drove to the Legislative Assembly building, where the crowds greeted them with enthusiastic cheers. Quebec Governor Duplessis officially welcomed the British King and Queen at the Legislative Assembly, expressing "the joy, respect, loyalty, and love of the entire province of Quebec." Mr. Duplessis recalled the grand occasions of the British King George V (during the era of Prince of Wales) in 1908 and Queen Mary's visit to Canada in 1901, and said, "We are particularly pleased that the British King's visit to Canada started in Quebec, which is the cradle of Canada. We believe that the British King is the fortress of our people's democratic system and constitutional freedom." The British King and Queen then went to the Governor-General's residence, where the leader of the Senate government, Mr. Dandurand, delivered a welcome speech in French, stating that the French-Canadians are willing to sincerely support the British King. The British King also responded in French, praising the beauty of Quebec and saying that the French and British peoples live here together in harmony. The spirit of Quebec is a combination of progress and conservatism. From early morning to late at night, countless people have cheered enthusiastically for the British King. This afternoon, 20,000 schoolchildren sang "God Save the King" and "O Canada" to the British King and Queen. Later, the British King issued a decree expressing his gratitude for the welcome telegrams from the United States and various autonomous territories, but there were so many that he could not reply to each one individually.</p>

<p>The Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan is a war for all Chinese people to fight for independence, freedom, and happiness. If this war is compromised halfway, not only will the country be lost, but the whole people will be humiliated. Even our Chinese descendants will be trapped in eternal suffering, and the entire world peace and human culture will be trampled and poisoned by the fascist invaders beyond imagination. However, the current war of resistance is still becoming increasingly difficult, and the * people and traitors are trying their best to undermine our * solidarity and obstruct our war of resistance. Therefore, we must mobilize the dynamic strength of the entire nation to support the war of resistance and crush the * poisonous schemes. This * not only relies on our compatriots at home, but also hopes for the efforts of overseas Chinese. Here, we not only hope that every man will join the army, but also that the 22.5 million women will rise up and participate!</p>
<p>Mr. Guan Wensen, an overseas Chinese businessman in Kuala Lumpur, has solely funded the establishment of the Wensen Women's Home Service Team. A group of seven people returned to the country from Singapore yesterday and arrived in Hong Kong. They will set off for Dongjiang within days to serve the soldiers on the front line. First of all, we want to pay the highest respect to the seven female overseas Chinese compatriots of the Wensen team: Ou Jinzhuo, Wang Chunhong, Li Fengdi, Zhu Shaozhen, He Yulan, Ye Qingshou, and Gu Xiuying, because you are the first to respond to the call of the motherland suffering in the flames of war, and the first to return to the embrace of the motherland in the heroic posture of patriotic overseas Chinese women, fighting for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the motherland! Among the extravagant and dissolute women, how admirable and proud you are! Among the aspiring women who are eager to join but have no way, how heroic you are as vanguards! Thousands upon thousands of supporters will follow behind the banner of "Saving the Motherland" that you are holding high! Secondly, we offer our highest respect to Mr. Guan Wensen, an overseas Chinese businessman in Kuala Lumpur! Because investing in assisting overseas Chinese to return to the country to serve is not only more commendable than any *華 act, but also more significant than any local * charitable donation. This behavior can not only be an *範 for thousands of wealthy overseas Chinese businessmen, but also greatly glorify overseas Chinese internationally and strengthen the determination of international justice advocates to assist China!</p>
<p>Follow the heroines among the seven Huapan and march towards the motherland in the flames of war! Follow in the footsteps of Mr. Guan, an overseas Chinese businessman in Kuala Lumpur, and enthusiastically donate to the motherland in distress!</p>

<h3 id="e36">Adapting to Extraordinary Times – Automatic Registration of Chinese People Already Implemented – Announced Starting Yesterday That Anyone with Specialized Talents Can Register – Four Chinese Representatives Issue a Proclamation to Overseas Chinese, Please Participate Enthusiastically <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government authorities have taken the step of registering Chinese and British residents in order to adapt to the needs of extraordinary times. The registration of British people has already exceeded 80%, and the authorities have decided to end it at the end of this month. The automatic registration of Chinese people was also announced to begin yesterday. Its nature is slightly different from the registration of British people. The registration of British people is mandatory, while the registration of Chinese people is purely voluntary. Chinese people, whether British or not, who possess the abilities and qualifications sought by the authorities can register automatically, and those who do not wish to do so may decline. The authorities have been preparing for the automatic registration of Chinese people for a long time, and it was only officially implemented yesterday. The registration form for soliciting the automatic registration of Chinese people with specialized talents has been printed. Although there is no stipulation regarding the registration deadline, the authorities have notified all registration offices to collect the forms at the end of June and send them back to the Chinese Civil Affairs Department. Chinese people aged 18 and above who are willing to serve Hong Kong voluntarily are requested to register at the designated registration offices.</p>
<p>The Chinese Civil Affairs Director Talks About the Beginning and End</p>
<p>Mr. Cary, the Director of Chinese Civil Affairs, met with reporters yesterday and announced the free registration of human resources. He stated that the Hong Kong Legislative Council passed the British Personnel Registration Ordinance in the spring of this year. This ordinance does not include Chinese people in the list of those who must register. He recalled that at a meeting of the Hong Kong Legislative Council last year, Chinese representative Mr. Zhou Junnian commented on the government's proposal to hold a personnel registration of Hong Kong residents. Mr. Zhou believed that Chinese people should not be an exception to the registration. He believed that some Chinese people were born in Hong Kong, and some had lived in Hong Kong for as long as twenty or thirty years. They have great love for Hong Kong, so the government also decided to hold free registration for Chinese people. The Civil Affairs Department is responsible for everything. Now 3,000 forms have been printed and distributed to various community organizations. Because this is a voluntary matter, it has not been possible to limit the registration period. However, it cannot be delayed repeatedly, so I have ordered all registration offices to collect the forms at the end of June and send them back to the Civil Affairs Department for sorting.</p>
<p>Proclamation to Overseas Chinese by Chinese Representatives</p>

<p>The Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps "Vincent Team," comprising seven individuals (female), led by team leader Ms. Ou Jinxiong, arrived in Hong Kong from Nanyang the day before yesterday. They are scheduled to depart during the day to serve in Dongguan, Bao'an, and Zengcheng. This situation has been reported in previous issues. The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief Association's Hong Kong Relief Office, to encourage them, held a tea party at the Huichang Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon to welcome the team leader Ou Jinxiong, recorder Wang Chunjiang, team members Zhu Shaozhen, Gu Xiuying, He Yulan, Ye Qingxiu, Li Fengdi, and former deputy commander of the Boluo Guerrilla Team, Chen Jie, Ke Xiaotang, Chen Chengkuan, Lin Lisan, and dozens of others. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The meeting started on time, and after performing the rituals,</p>
<p>All Seven Members Are Female</p>
<p>Chairman Ke Xiao announced the reason for the meeting, stating that today, our office welcomes the Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps "Vincent Team." We are honored and grateful to have everyone present to offer guidance. Since the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese in Nanyang have continuously contributed money and effort to help the motherland and have shown enthusiastic sympathy, which is deeply admired. The Nanyang Huiqiao Relief Association previously organized two teams to return to the country to serve. Now, Mr. Vincent Huan has independently organized the "Vincent Team" to return home to serve wounded soldiers and refugees at the front lines. This shows that the saying "overseas Chinese are the mother of revolution" is very accurate. All the members of the "Vincent Team" are female, which is particularly commendable. It shows that for our country to achieve final victory, not only men must rise up, but women must also rise up. With men and women united, striving for victory in the War of Resistance, the strength of the nation's resistance will be greater, and victory will come sooner. Finally, he hoped that all members of the "Vincent Team" would return to the countryside, mobilize thousands upon thousands of rural women to contribute to the country, and achieve the final victory of national liberation. End of speech.</p>
<p>Departing During the Day to Serve in Dongbao</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ms. Zhu Shaozhen, representing the team, gave a brief report on the organization's progress. First, she expressed her gratitude for the welcoming meeting and expressed her deep humility. She stated that since the War of Resistance, overseas compatriots have been organizing teams to return to the country to serve. Among the overseas compatriots who were unable to return to the country to serve, their enthusiasm for the work of saving the country was exceptionally strong. The team was established on the 21st of last month, with training scheduled from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and in the afternoon, they engaged in the work of collecting medicines. On the 2nd, the training and fundraising concluded simultaneously. At that time, they raised over a thousand yuan. By the 5th of this month, they started their journey to Hong Kong. On the ship, enthusiastic individuals donated over 140 yuan, which will be used to purchase medicines to comfort the soldiers at the front. With such enthusiasm from our compatriots, the final victory of our country can be secured. Ms. Zhu continued, stating that the team will depart to serve in Dongguan, Bao'an, Zengcheng, and other places. Today, they received a warm welcome, expressing their willingness to serve the country with loyalty. Finally, Ms. Zhu, on behalf of the entire team, extended the most respectful greetings to everyone. After the speech, Mr. Zhong Xiunan delivered a speech, expressing his respect for the "Vincent Team" for coming from afar and sacrificing their home-saving work. He also expressed his admiration for the fact that the team was entirely composed of women. Finally, Chen and others delivered words of encouragement. The tea party concluded around 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>The China National Salvation Drama Troupe has achieved remarkable results in its propaganda work on the front lines and in rural areas. A month ago, in order to enhance the national salvation sentiment of overseas compatriots and expand the international aid-China movement, it came to Hong Kong from the mainland to prepare for propaganda activities in Nanyang, the Philippines, and the United States. Since arriving in Hong Kong, it has been warmly welcomed by various groups. This situation has been reported in previous issues. The Federation of Various Circles in Hong Kong, admiring the troupe's theatrical art, has invited it to give a large-scale charity performance for the Federation before its departure abroad, in order to raise funds for disaster relief and national salvation propaganda. The troupe has now decided to stage great plays such as "Defend the Motherland," "Long Live the Nation," and "The Spring of Taierzhuang" at the Lee Theatre for three consecutive nights starting on the 25th of this month. At that time, there will surely be a grand and enthusiastic occasion. It is reported that after the performance, the troupe will immediately go to Nanyang to comfort overseas compatriots and complete even greater tasks. In order to seek advice and thank the various groups for their kindness, the troupe has specifically scheduled a tea party tomorrow (the 20th) at 3:00 PM on the second floor of the Gloucester Hotel, inviting celebrities from all walks of life in Hong Kong to attend and provide guidance.

<p>Areas with Foreign Buildings Filling Hong Kong and Kowloon After the War of Resistance</p>
<p>"The boat moves, one feels the bank shifting." There are not "few" foreign buildings in Hong Kong; it is just that too "many" people have come—refugees driven away by [omission] people, drifting like a tide to the edge of the sea. At this time, the large island of Hong Kong is just right for the refugees to "land together on the other shore."</p>
<p>During calm and peaceful times, one or even an entire building on the island would be available for rent. Even if a sign was posted, it would take at least one or two days, or even a week, for someone to inquire. The rent and terms would have to be discussed repeatedly. However, nowadays, not to mention an entire floor or building, even a small room or corner requires three times the rent or even demands for "extra fees" or "commissions." When a house becomes available for rent, there is simply no need to post a sign. Even if one is posted, it will never tell people the house number... Whether it's monopoly or control, finding a house requires one to "lower one's head and bow one's heart"!</p>
<p>"Demand exceeds supply, prices will be high." This is a natural phenomenon. When people are crowded together, rents are raised higher. Many refugees want to do business, scraping together some money to make a living, but how can so many refugees find a way in a capitalist society?</p>
<p>Using the space under the stairs to open a shop is truly "making the most of every piece of land"! A hungry crowd, they do not have the ability to open large stores, so they have to seek a way out under the stairs.</p>
<p>This is not just an accidental glimpse, but a common phenomenon. Over the past six months, when we walk down the street, as long as we pay a little attention, we can see small shops under the stairs everywhere. Whether in Hong Kong or Kowloon, in every residential area, such as Caine Road, Wong Nai Chung Road, Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, etc., at the entrances of stone, cement, or Italian plaster stairs, we almost always see these cramped small shops. Here, there is a doorway decorated in a grand style. There are small spaces with glass cabinets and shelves arranged haphazardly, filled with Western magazines, and others piled with stationery. The so-called modern, new-style window decorations are unexpectedly applied to the corners under the stairs. They, struggling, are they not just as miserably managed? Look, the sparkling electric lights illuminate their groceries brightly, and the charming potted flowers adorn their facades with red and green colors.</p>
<p>Some use a hundred or so dollars as their capital, some use two hundred dollars to unfold their "beautiful dreams," and there are quite a few who are struggling hard with only ten or twenty dollars. What do they sell? They do not have warehouses or storage, they are simply "hawkers" under the capitalist system. In terms of supplies, they have Western-style stationery and envelopes, scarves and ties; snow creams, lipsticks, and nail polishes, as long as they are cheap and easy to sell, they have everything; in terms of food, they contain everything imaginable. There are biscuits, pastries, and the rest are olives, preserved plums, Chia Ying Zi, walnut cakes, fish skin peanuts, iron-essence beef, kiwi candies, Saqima... Is there anything they don't have? As for things to play with, they are even more comprehensive. Model paper is the most popular item recently; even clay figurines, wooden rabbits, and paper frogs are arranged in a variety of ways to cater to customers as much as possible.</p>
<p>In the small shops, one cannot see pot-bellied managers full of the smell of money, nor can one see bosses in long gowns and short jackets. What one sees are the fate-resistors who are clenching their teeth and struggling for a living. The middle-aged ones may even be small businessmen fleeing from the occupied areas, and the elderly ones are even more trying to prolong their lives with dwindling energy! Among them, the most noteworthy and the most serious issue is the many young girls. They are at the age of youth and vitality, could it be that they have no home to return to, or no books to read? This group, this group, are they taking the opportunity to make money, or are they forced to do this? — Where do they live? Ah! — In a prismatic corner under the stairs, they seek a place to settle down, just like silkworms making nests.</p>
<p>I heard that even a staircase entrance like this costs ten or eight dollars to rent. This is how the so-called "every inch of land is precious" is formed. When the night falls, the neon lights intoxicate the ladies; the young women in the small shops also put on thicker rouge. We see her smiling at the moon-like tips of her eyebrows; she understands, this one dollar and eight cents of income is enough to make a living! But is this the real way out? Where is the real way out? Let smart readers answer for themselves.</p>

On the day of the exhibition, all the works will be displayed for public viewing.

<p>In order to expand disaster relief, the charity performance by ladies and celebrities is approaching, and the work of the actors is becoming more serious. They dare not be careless. You see, the actors have been putting on makeup during the recent rehearsals and performing with grace.</p>
<p>Miss Xin Mulin is a graduate of St. Paul's Girls' School and now works at the Nanjing Bank. She is of moderate height, beautiful, and lively. She plays the role of Lin Baoqin in the "Dream of the Red Chamber," a flower of beauty that can be appreciated, smelled, drawn, and worn as a hairpin. Her expressions and singing skills are particularly remarkable.</p>

<p>Miss Lu Xiulian Playing Jia Yuanchun in the Play</p>
<p>Miss Lu Xiulian plays Jia Yuanchun, the most beautiful and innocent. She is a graduate of St. Stephen's Girls' College and loves to study music. It is believed that she will be able to give full play to her strengths during the upcoming performance.</p>
<p>Miss Guan Yaozhi plays Jia Xichun. She is a high-achieving student at Pui To Girls' School and the daughter of Guan Xinmin. She is very quiet and loves to paint. Sometimes, when the school celebrates anniversaries with drama performances, she is one of the mainstays, and her graceful dances and clear songs can make the audience applaud incessantly.</p>

<p>Miss Lu Yanxing plays Li Wan. She has a dignified and virtuous appearance, which is very suitable. She is originally a Western music expert and has deep knowledge from her graduation from St. Stephen's Girls' College. Her father is the current political figure Mr. Lu Wenlan.</p>
<p>Miss Lu Yanxing Playing Li Wan in the Play</p>
<p>In the home of Mrs. Tan Shifan, the chairman of the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, her old lady is painstakingly supervising the servants and receiving guests during the rehearsal of the drama. She also personally takes care of the makeup and costumes, ensuring that each actor wears the correct attire. She does not delegate this task to others, but respectfully provides for them. I understand the old lady's intentions, because the actors are taking on the important responsibility of saving the nation through charity performances, and they are very busy. If she can take care of their clothes, it will surely bring them mental pleasure. If they can gain mental pleasure, the appeal to the audience will naturally be stronger. The old lady's feelings for the country can be said to be meticulous.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Guangdong Provincial Government Determines Measures to Handle Accumulated Cases in Various Counties, Dealing with Them Leniently to Expedite the Resolution of Outstanding Cases <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Shaoguan) Since Li Han-hun took office as the chairman of Guangdong Province, his aim has been to eliminate corruption and promote benefits. Considering that various counties in the province have suffered from successive incidents, and county magistrates have been frequently replaced, cases have often remained unsettled, with some cases dating back dozens of terms of office. These cases have been repeatedly shirked and deferred, leading to a daily increase in accumulated cases. It is estimated that from the third year of the Republic of China (1914) to the end of July of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), there were more than 1,200 accumulated cases that had not been resolved. Repeated urging for supplementary handling has been ineffective. Although the provincial government had passed measures for clearing accumulated cases in August of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), only a few have complied with them to this day. This is partly due to the lack of vigorous implementation by county magistrates, but also because many cases are difficult to clear due to the remoteness of the years, changes in personnel, unknown addresses, or the death of the persons involved, and other reasons. Rather than leaving the debts uncleared and facing endless entanglements, it is better to set a deadline and deal with them leniently to expedite the resolution of outstanding cases. Therefore, the Department of Finance has been instructed to revise the clearing measures, which have been submitted to the 25th provincial affairs meeting for approval and implementation. The main points are as follows: (1) All unsettled cases of former county and city bureau chiefs or magistrates from January of the 3rd year of the Republic of China (1914) to the end of July of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) shall be cleared in accordance with the following measures. (2) If a former county or city bureau chief or magistrate, whether or not they have completed handover procedures, falls under any of the following categories, the case shall be closed upon approval by the Department of Finance based on a truthful report from the successor, and the closure shall be reported to the provincial government for record-keeping: 1. The person has passed away and has no heirs. 2. The person served for less than three months, did not complete handover procedures, and there are no investigations of arrears in public funds. 3. A register has already been created and reported, but the case has not been closed due to incomplete procedures. After investigation and reporting by the successor, with no arrears in public funds, the case shall be closed upon approval by the Department of Finance, and the closure shall be reported to the provincial government for record-keeping. (3) For cases where handover procedures have been completed and registers have been submitted to the county or city bureau but have not yet been closed, the current officeholder shall handle them in accordance with the following provisions: 1. If the managed funds have been cleared and there are no arrears, regardless of whether the original submitted forms are complete or not, the matter shall be promptly investigated, reported to the Department of Finance for approval and closure, and reported to the provincial government for record-keeping. 2. If the handover procedures have been completed and submitted to the county or city bureau but have been subsequently lost and cannot be resubmitted, and after investigation, it is found that there are no arrears in public funds, the successor shall investigate, revise, and report to the Department of Finance for approval and closure, and report the closure to the provincial government for record-keeping. 3. If it is clearly determined that there are arrears in public funds, a register shall be immediately created and reported, along with the amount of arrears and a detailed list, and two copies shall be prepared and submitted to the Department of Finance for review and transfer to the Department of Civil Affairs for verification. For those who served for more than three months and have created a handover register, if there are confirmed arrears in public funds, the current officeholder shall investigate and urge repayment, and report to the Department of Finance for compilation and publication in newspapers in Hong Kong, Macau, Shaoguan, and Shantou, setting a deadline for settlement before the end of October of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). If the deadline is exceeded, the Department of Finance shall verify the facts and issue an arrest warrant for investigation and prosecution. 5. If current public officials in the province have outstanding handover matters from their previous tenure as county or city bureau chiefs or magistrates, they shall immediately send personnel to the relevant counties or city bureaus to settle them within the time limit specified in the preceding article. If the deadline is exceeded, they shall be dismissed and handled in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article. 6. If a current county or city bureau chief is ordered to hand over their duties during the period of clearing handover documents and cases, they shall specifically transfer the handled clearing records and other documents to the successor for continued processing. 7. Current county and city bureau chiefs may hire additional personnel to assist in clearing handover cases, as appropriate. The required labor costs, stationery, and other expenses shall be budgeted and submitted to the Department of Finance for approval, and paid from the county and local reserve funds for the 28th year. 8. Current county and city bureau chiefs shall complete the clearing by the end of October of the 28th year (1939). Those who exceed the deadline shall be subject to the following penalties: 1. A minor demerit for exceeding the deadline by half a month. 2. A major demerit for exceeding the deadline by one month. 3. Dismissal for exceeding the deadline by three months. The aforementioned measures will be officially announced and implemented soon.</p>

<p>(1) Unprecedented Record According to recent news from Washington, the list of people who earned more than $15,000 per year in 1937 has been compiled. This list was compiled by the Department of Finance based on the income taxes paid by each individual. The results show that seven of the top ten highest paid people are Hollywood figures. Louis B. Mayer, Chairman of MGM, ranked first with an annual salary of $1,296,503. The annual salary is so generous that it has never been seen before in the United States, creating an unprecedented page. Among the top twenty highest paid people, fifteen are actors, actresses or film company executives. If we take the company as a unit, the table shows that the top three companies are MGM Films, DuPont, and Metropolitan Life Insurance. The annual salaries of the employees in these three companies who earn more than $15,000 are: MGM (240 people), DuPont (196 people), and Metropolitan (167 people). According to statistics, the annual salaries of wage earners increased significantly in 1937 compared to 1936.</p>

<p>(4) Great Change</p>
<p>Carole Lombard and Clark Gable were married last month. Their combined annual income is $600,300, which is much higher than two years ago. There have been many changes in the 1937 list. In 1936, Louis B. Mayer was not included in the top ten highest paid people. In that year, Alfred Sloan of General Motors was the highest paid person in the United States with an annual salary of $561,311. Mae West's income in 1936 was $323,000, but she was not included in the top 20 highest paid people in 1937. It's just luck.</p>

<p>Clark Gable: Clark's comedies are more numerous than war and historical films. The comedies have an average development, while the historical films are best known for "Mutiny on the Bounty".</p>
<p>Wallace Beery: Wallace Beery's "The Champ" and "Min and Bill" are immortal works, and "Viva Villa!" can be called the representative of the immortal works.</p>
<p>William Powell: William is good at acting in realistic dramas, and his performances are also balanced. If movie fans are not forgetful, the former "The Thin Man" and the current "The Great Detective Nick" should be the most hilarious.</p>
<p>Tyrone Power: Tyrone's famous works are "Lloyd's of London" and "In Old Chicago". Tyrone in "In Old Chicago" is not weak either. These two films can be called Tyrone's representative works.</p>
<p>Errol Flynn: Errol's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" are already known to everyone as Errol's two best films.</p>

<p>She thought to herself that this girl was extremely lovely. He greeted her with a smile.</p>
<p>Then they began to talk. Although Eliza's speech had some blurring on a certain tone, people couldn't tell after listening to it. But when it came to long conversations, she didn't know how to answer people's questions. Mrs. Higgins asked her how the weather was, and she recited the practice sentence that the professor had taught her, which made the listeners confused. Later, when they talked about health, she replied in a vulgar language. The guests were all nobles and didn't understand at all. They stared at each other. Higgins was so anxious that he was in a terrible state, and his repeated hints were ineffective. Knowing that this time she must have revealed her secrets, he himself could not avoid being used as a joke by the people of London. Furthermore, he would lose the bet with Pickering.</p>
<p>At the critical moment, a savior suddenly came. One of the guests, a young man named Freddie Hill, had been looking at Eliza with a fascinated look. At this time, he suddenly laughed.</p>
<p>"I say, Miss Doolittle," his tone was full of hot appreciation, "you have learned those new slang words so interestingly."</p>
<p>"New slang words, yes," Higgins had to put on a forced smile and echoed, but the eyes looking at Eliza were not happy.</p>
<p>When he, Pickering, and Eliza returned to the laboratory on Downing Street, he was very unhappy. Eliza, like a wronged child, sat on a chair and cried sadly.</p>
<p>Pickering looked at her sympathetically and said gently, "We should be ashamed, Higgins. We really shouldn't have done this."</p>
<p>Higgins suddenly smiled and said, "Maybe we were too hasty, but I can correct it."</p>
<p>Eliza sighed long, raised her lovely eyes, and looked at him eagerly.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Hong Kong-Philippines Tennis Exhibition Match: Xu Wei-pei Bravely Defeats Philippine General: Philippine Generals Win All Other Matches <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[New Asia News] Yesterday afternoon at 4 pm, the second Hong Kong-Philippines tennis exhibition match was held at the YMCA. The order was: (1) Doubles, Philippine players vs. Lam Zhen brothers, (2) Singles, Om-bang vs. Xu Run-pei, (3) Singles, San Jashi vs. Xu Wei-pei. All three programs were spectacular. The last scene can be called the "Hong Kong-Philippines International Singles Tennis Tournament", because Xu is the Hong Kong champion and San Jashi is the Philippine champion.</p>
<p>First battle</p>
<p>The Lam Zhen brothers tried their best in their first battle against the Philippine generals, but unfortunately their ball luck was not good. In the first set, they actually lost four games. They were completely unable to cope with the pair of San Jashi and Om-bang. After this threat, the Lam Zhen brothers changed their strategy and sent high balls to attack the opponent's weaknesses when they had the chance. They gradually caught up and made it a 5-5 tie. After that, San Chengshi's high pressure gradually improved, unlike yesterday's lack of confidence. He broke the Lam brothers' strategy and won 7-5. In the second set, Om-bang showed off his skills, and his attacks and defenses were commendable. The "pounce" in front of the net was even more miraculous. The Governor of Hong Kong, who was watching the game, applauded repeatedly. As a result, the Philippine generals won the second set again with 6-4. The results are as follows: Shan An - 7-5 6-4 - Lam Zhen Brothers</p>
<p>Second battle</p>
<p>Xu Runpei and Anbang competed in a singles match. Xiao Xu did his best in the first set and tied four times. The competition was quite fierce. The child Anbang was not only good at deadly attacks, but also very good at defense and rescue. Every dangerous ball sent out by Xiao Xu was hit back by his "skating-style quick steps". The audience kept cheering. Anbang's weakness was in the backhand, so Xiao Xu repeatedly sent the ball to his left. However, Anbang was agile and had many tricks to make up for his shortcomings, and finally won the first set 7-5. In the second set, Xiao Xu became more lax and lost to Anbang 1-6. Yesterday, Xiao Xu performed well in the first set. Just look at the results, and you will know that Xiao Xu had a great chance of defeating Anbang. It is a pity that Xiao Xu failed to fight calmly and was defeated.</p>
<p>Anbang - 7-5 6-1 - Xu Runpei</p>
<p>Third battle</p>
<p>San Jashi vs. Da Xu, San Jashi served first, with three consecutive "double faults", and then three consecutive "aces". He took advantage of the serve to take the first game. In the second game, Da Xu used two techniques to deal with the enemy: a forehand smash and a backhand slice. He won back a game and made it 1-1. After that, San Jashi served and San Jashi won, and Da Xu served and Da Xu won. They held on to each other and tied 4-4. When Da broke San Jashi's serve at 5-4, he became active and sent strong sideline balls continuously. Although San Jashi could not resist, Da won 6-4. In the second set, San Jashi managed to take a 2-0 lead, but Da reversed the defeat and won 6-2 in one go.</p>
<p>Looking at the two major battles, Da Xu has always displayed his personal peak skills. His weakest serving technique has been completely renewed, which is really a good work. San Jashi is not weak. The forehand "horizontal slice" is extremely sharp. Even if it is hit once, the opponent is helpless. Compared with when he came to Hong Kong last December, he has made great progress. It can be said that he is a different person. This time Xu was able to defeat this master, which can be said to be heroic.</p>
<p>Da Xu - 6-4 6-2 - San Jashi</p>

<p>...The Xuhe Cup football final, which was undecided the week before last, was replayed between the Navy and South China at Jiashan at 5 PM the day before yesterday. Although there was a Taiwan-Philippines Cup tennis exhibition match at 4 PM on the same day, football fans and enthusiasts flocked to Jiashan to watch the game. Including friends from Langyuan and Shandaoh, the crowd swelled to about 10,000 people. It was considered the last scene of the football season, a rare opportunity not to be missed. Wang Zhengting, Lu Guang, Chen Ce, and others also attended with their wives as spectators (Note: Wang, Lu, and Chen are all government officials who are very enthusiastic about supporting sports).</p>
<p>...Five o'clock arrived, but South China only had ten players, which alarmed the fans. Center forward Li Huitang was late. It was said that he couldn't leave his office early due to official business. The fans waited anxiously.</p>
<p>...Navy defender Xuan Di made an excessive move, intentionally hitting Yang Shuiyi. The referee was fair and ejected him, adding a stain to the football game.</p>
<p>...South China won the championship with a score of 4-1, completing the unprecedented feat of winning six major championships this year for a Chinese team.</p>
<p>After the game, Mrs. Jia Naixi presented the awards, and the fans were overjoyed. There will be opportunities in the future. Goodbye for now. (Xin Sheng)</p>

<h3 id="e69">School Volleyball Tournament: Senior Baoluo Defeats Hanzhong; Junior Peiying Easily Defeats Southwest <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The school volleyball tournament, organized by the Volleyball Association, held two matches yesterday, one senior and one junior. In the senior match, Baoluo played against Hanzhong. Baoluo was quite strong, with consistent attacks from the front row and meticulous defense from the middle and back rows. Hou Yueyu and Ren Zhaohui were able to attack from the sides, and the back line was also well-coordinated. Hanzhong fought hard as a team, and their defense was also mutually supportive, but their offensive power on the front line was weak, so they were repeatedly taken advantage of by Baoluo, who won 3-0. After the start of the match, Baoluo's momentum was strong. Hou Yueyu and Liao Jianfen attacked from the left and right. Hanzhong's Zheng Guancan, Yang Yongsen, Liu Binglin, and Pan Rurong also tried their best to fight back. After a fierce battle, Baoluo took the lead in the first game with 21-16. Taking advantage of their victory, Baoluo repeatedly put pressure on Hanzhong. Chen Huaquan, Hou Yueyu, Ren Zhaohui, Liao Jianfen, and Huang Yuchang attacked from five directions, and Hanzhong was in a state of chaos. Li Qihao, Yang Zhenlv, and Liu Binglin tried their best to block, and Li Yufen and Lin Qingmin advanced step by step, but Baoluo continued to apply pressure, and Hanzhong still lost with a score of 8-21. Afterwards, Hanzhong hoped to recover lost ground, but Baoluo's army was in full swing. Hou Yueyu fired from the front, Ren Zhaohui attacked from the back, and Huang Yuchang and Li Mingjie were able to support. Hanzhong launched a counterattack when they were down 8-15, but Baoluo's back row was already prepared, and ultimately it was ineffective. The third game was lost with a score of 12-21. In the junior match between Peiying and Southwest, Peiying's combat power was quite strong, and the match became one-sided. Southwest resisted, but lost 3-0. In the first game, Peiying won 21-5, in the second game 21-9, and in the third game 21-6. The lineups of the two senior teams are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e70">Foreign Exchange Arbitrage and Capital Flight <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Yongyu</p>
<p>1. What is Foreign Exchange Arbitrage?</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange market has always distinguished between near-term and forward contracts. Due to market conditions, there is a difference between the market prices of near-term and forward contracts. Sometimes the near-term price is higher than the forward price, and sometimes the near-term price is lower than the forward price. Recently, the market has mostly been near-cheap and far-expensive, meaning that the price for this month is lower than the price for the next month. If you buy a futures contract for this month and sell a futures contract for the next month at the same time, a difference will occur. This difference is interest. The level of interest depends on the size of the difference. The method is similar to the previous arbitrage of public bonds.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of calculating interest rates for arbitrage, there are two types: ordinary method and simplified method. The method of calculating interest rates for English gold arbitrage will be described separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary algorithm,</p>
<p>For example, on December 24th, the opening price of the black market for foreign exchange in the morning was 8.59375 for the English gold in December, and 8.5625 for January of the 28th year. If you want to invest 10,000 pounds, what is the monthly interest rate?</p>
<p>National currency to be delivered in December</p>
<p>National currency can be received in January The difference is $1,019.24, which is $279,272.73 in monthly interest. To find the monthly interest rate,</p>
<p>That is, the monthly interest rate is more than three-tenths.</p>
<p>(2) Simplified algorithm,</p>
<p>Divide the difference between the market prices of the current and next months by the market price of the next month and multiply by the monthly interest rate.</p>
<p>According to the above example,</p>
<p>The difference between the market prices in December and January is 0.03125, and the market price in January is 8.5625. The calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>0.03125+8,5625×1,000＝3,64995033, which is more than three-tenths per month.</p>

<p>The ordinary algorithm and the simplified algorithm have the same principle. The interest rates obtained are mostly the same, and the tails are slightly different due to the rounding of the English gold combined with the national currency.</p>
<p>Method of calculating interest rates for US dollar arbitrage:</p>
<p>For example, on June 23, 27th year, the black market price for June was 18 yuan,</p>
<p>The price for July is 17 and a half yuan, what is the monthly interest rate?</p>
<p>(Calculated in US$100,000)</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary algorithm,</p>
<p>National currency to be delivered in June</p>
<p>National currency can be received in July</p>
<p>The difference is $15,873.02, which is $555,555.5 in monthly interest. To find the monthly interest rate,</p>
<p>Multiply $15,873.02 by 1,000 (monthly interest rate) divided by $555,559.55 = 28.5714362</p>
<p>That is, the monthly interest rate is more than 2.8%.</p>
<p>(1) Simplified algorithm,</p>
<p>The difference between the market prices in June and July is 50, and the market price in July is 17.5. The calculation formula is as follows:, 50 17.5×1,000 28.57142857,</p>
<p>That is, the monthly interest rate is more than 2.8%.</p>
<p>The interest rates obtained by the above two methods are mostly the same, and the asterisks are slightly different due to the rounding of the US dollar combined with the national currency.</p>
<p>Note: The above interest rates do not deduct the funds used by the broker. According to bank practice, one twenty-second of a percent must be paid for the national currency invested in the sale of foreign exchange, and no funds are paid for the purchase of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>3. Comparison of High and Low US Dollar Arbitrage Interest Rates in the Last Half Year</p>
<p>In order to compare the high and low arbitrage interest rates in Shanghai in the past six months, we have selected the daily comparison in the most recent six months that can represent it (because the arbitrage interest rates on each day in each month vary depending on the size of the difference) and listed them separately below to observe the general trend. 』The company's profits were as high as 700 yuan. There were two reasons for such a harvest:</p>
<p>(1) Sales in Europe and the United States have improved, and silk prices have soared as a result.</p>
<p>(2) The dried cocoons stored in the warehouses of Chinese manufacturers were confiscated.</p>
<p>Now Xidi is forced to continue invading the silk mills under its control, with a total of 14 factories and 4,852 machines. Legitimate merchants are unable to gain a foothold and have to set up factories in Shanghai. From April of last year to the present year, according to the most accurate statistics in the silk industry, there are a total of 37 factories, 20 of which are distributed in the concession area and 17 in the Shanghai West out-of-bounds area. The total number of machines is 5,835, and 70% (such as 4,084 machines) work night shifts. Therefore, there are currently about 10,000 silk machines in Shanghai, producing more than 3,100 dan of silk per month. If we calculate 4 dan of dried cocoons to produce 1 dan of raw silk, then 12,400 dan of dried cocoons are used per month. If the factory operates all year round, the raw materials that Shanghai silk factories should store must be 150,000 dan to maintain production. The above statistics are calculated based on 18 taels of silk produced per machine per day. As for the speed of work and the amount of output, it depends on the internal management of each factory. The raw silk production is now listed in the table below (the unit of measurement is catties):</p>

<h3 id="e74">The Current Students' Necessary Reform of Physical Training (II) <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>In the past, students engaged in physical training mostly because of the limitations of the curriculum, the compulsion of the school, and the supervision of the teachers. They were passive and reluctant, holding the concept of doing it for the curriculum, for the school, and for the teachers. Therefore, they were perfunctory and sloppy, and as soon as they left the class, they threw physical training to the clouds. As a result of this passive and reluctant approach, school sports became the patent of a few active people, and most students had the name of physical education but not the substance of physical education. The effect of physical education was out of the question. This passive and reluctant wrong idea must be reformed, and the spirit of automatic initiative must be possessed.</p>
<p>In the past, students' attitudes towards sports became two phenomena: one was that they knew a little about the superficial aspects of sports and thought they were extraordinary, holding the concept of being the only one, arrogant and indulgent, and dominating the school's sports. The other was that they did not know what sports were and regarded sports as strange and ugly acts, holding the concept that it is better to hide one's clumsiness than to show it off. They regarded the sports field as a long distance and never moved throughout the year. Therefore, the phenomenon of the few strong becoming stronger and the many weak becoming weaker naturally formed. This arrogant and timid wrong idea must be reformed, and the spirit of being unashamed must be possessed.</p>
<p>In the past, students often held the concept that sports were for entertainment. They were willing to do sports that were entertaining, and they were willing to do them within the limits of entertainment, without having to use much effort; otherwise, they were not willing to do them. It should be known that it is acceptable to replace entertainment with sports, but it is unacceptable to think that the purpose of sports is entertainment. The more invigorated the spirit is, the more powerful the physical strength becomes, and the more outstanding the degree of endurance and hard work, the more outstanding the physical strength generated, and the more determined the physique becomes. The acquisition of a strong physique can only be obtained by exchanging effort for it. Even if it is full of money and concentrated power, it cannot be achieved. This wrong idea of regarding sports as entertainment must be eliminated, and the spirit of endurance and hard work must be possessed.</p>
<p>In the past, students often held the concept that sports were the only tool for fitness. When exercising, they paid attention with concentration and meticulousness. Once they left the exercise, they only wanted to wear clothes that looked good, narrow and tight; they only wanted to eat food that pleased their taste buds, devouring it; they only wanted to be warm in bed, closing the windows and covering their heads; they only loved freedom of action, romantic and corrupted. The result of this kind of exercise without hygiene is no different from hygiene without exercise; or even worse, because hygiene without exercise still has some opportunities for activity in daily work; exercise without hygiene, then the physical strength consumed by exercise and the energy consumed by not living healthy cannot be replenished, and it will inevitably lead to decline and exhaustion. This mistaken concept of emphasizing exercise must be reformed, and the spirit of equally emphasizing exercise and hygiene must be possessed.</p>
<p>2. Reform of Materials: There are many kinds of sports, and their nature and functions are different. It has a close relationship with the current situation and environment and the physical condition of each person. If you cannot choose the appropriate materials and use them properly, and if you do not observe the situation and do not meet the needs, and if you follow others and blindly follow suit, the results obtained are self-evident.</p>
<p>In the overall war of resistance, the whole country should concentrate all its strength and work hard under the goal of resisting the war. Take what is beneficial to the war of resistance, otherwise discard it. This is the unanimous position of the whole group. Therefore, I dare to arbitrarily reveal two principles for the selection of materials for students' physical training: it must be able to save the economy and enhance the war of resistance's "financial resources"; it must be applicable to military affairs and enhance the war of resistance's "human resources." Based on these two principles, we can examine the current problem of the materials used for students' physical training:</p>
<p>Ball games and track and field sports, especially ball games, are the sports that students like the most in the past. Throughout the country, it can be said that there are very few examples of using other sports as materials for students' physical training. Indeed, this kind of sports contains many natural movements, is free and lively, and is suitable for people's free psychology. Everyone loves it, and there is a reason for it: and the agility and flexibility of movements cannot be said to be absolutely not beneficial to military affairs. However, it is a sport that cannot be done without money, and has a completely aristocratic color, which is not suitable for the current situation in which all parties are saving money for the war of resistance; and the actions that directly or indirectly benefit the military are also insufficient.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<p>4. The Relationship Between the Level of Interest Rates and Capital Flight</p>
<p>Capital flight mostly involves domestic people depositing money in foreign banks or buying foreign exchange. However, the level of arbitrage interest rates also affects capital flight. Because arbitrage interest is high, it absorbs domestic people to engage in foreign exchange arbitrage transactions. Moreover, those who do not understand what arbitrage is are also successively added to it under the promotion of newspapers on the favorable interest rates. For example, in October, because the arbitrage interest rate can be around 20% per month, arbitrage transactions were particularly active. According to the reports of the three major banks in China, the amount of money flowing directly and indirectly into foreign banks in October exceeded 10 million yuan. However, in the past two months, the interest rates offered by arbitrage have been declining, and domestic people are unwilling to engage in this kind of transaction again, and have transferred their funds back and deposited them in Chinese banks to earn interest. The amount is quite large, estimated to be several million yuan. It can be said that a part of the capital flight has been recovered. Most of the initiators of foreign exchange arbitrage are foreign banks. They determine the size of the difference due to their position, and most of them specify on the order that the foreign exchange must be deposited in the bank, without interest. Therefore, foreign arbitrage can be said to be a credit loan from foreign banks to domestic people. Based on the current market situation, if the interest rate offered by arbitrage is high, there will be more capital flight; if the interest rate is low, the capital that has escaped will naturally be recovered. The capital flight has a great impact on the market, and the rise and fall of the black market exchange rate for remittances and discounts are also related. In short, foreign exchange arbitrage and capital flight are very closely related.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Statistics on Shanghai Silk Factory Production <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all industries have suffered huge losses. The Chinese silk industry, which was in the midst of recovery, has suffered this unprecedented catastrophe. Those who hear about it are deeply saddened. In recent years, the Chinese government has recognized silk as an important commodity for China's export, so it has spared no effort in promoting and supervising it. In addition, the efforts of our silk workers have greatly improved, so the products have been greatly refined. Shanghai is the hub of foreign trade, and the government has deliberately established a provincial inspection bureau. The Chinese silk exported must undergo strict inspection before it can be transported to Europe and the United States. Therefore, foreign firms are only willing to purchase raw silk that has passed the inspection bureau and trust it very much.</p>
<p>Now, the areas of cocoon production and silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have fallen one after another. The silk industry is under the control of the Japanese puppets, and all material economy is being exploited. Last year, the so-called "</p>

<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>Two Kinds of People</p>
<p>During the horrific bombings of Chongqing on the third and fourth days [of the month], early on the morning of the fifth, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a sorrowful speech at the National Government Anniversary Meeting. Besides providing specific measures for emergency relief, he also urged civil and military officials to steel their resolve for sacrifice and intensify their work to counter the enemy's indiscriminate bombing. However, after the meeting, it is said that some high-ranking officials and dignitaries took their concubines and fled to safe havens in the countryside; others accompanied their wives (let's call them wives, although I bet they were mistresses!) to Hong Kong for leisure. They turned a deaf ear to Chairman Chiang's instructions. For these people, it was truly "women first, escape first"!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the chairman of the relief committee, the octogenarian Mr. Xu Shiying, the "father of refugees," (I won't even mention Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, who personally inspected the disaster areas and comforted the refugees.) bravely flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing, a city considered too dangerous by the cowardly, to personally oversee all emergency relief matters. He even personally inspected every refugee shelter and disaster area, supervising the distribution of aid, excavation, burial, and other work.</p>
<p>In addition to our utmost admiration for this fearless work ethic, we must urge those gentlemen who prioritize "women first, escape first" to learn from Mr. Xu!</p>
<p>Two: Gift-Giving</p>
<p>The poverty in the northwestern provinces truly surpasses our imagination. During my recent trip, I met many high-ranking officials from these provinces, who repeatedly sighed and told me: "Mr. Lin! Being a township head in your province is better than being a district head here; being a district head in your province is better than being a county magistrate here; being a county magistrate in your province is better than being a provincial chairman here..." I often just laughed without knowing how to respond. Later, after carefully inspecting their so-called rural and urban areas, I not only realized that their jokes contained a great deal of truth, but I was also astonished at how the people of the Northwest were able to survive!</p>
<p>However, even with that being said, "financial resources" are still "available." Let me give a simple example! I saw a department head buy almost two thousand dollars worth of deer antlers as gifts for his superiors. How do department heads survive in times of national crisis when they give away a year's salary in one gift? Or, where does their money come from? This humble fellow is not clever and lacks economic knowledge. I can't figure it out.</p>
<p>Three: Thrifty Cuisine</p>
<p>Article Two of the National Covenant is "not to violate government laws." The government has issued laws stating that during the national crisis, banquets should not exceed eight yuan per table for Chinese food or one yuan per person for Western food. Of course, the general "big shots," as good citizens, will abide by the National Covenant, but their method of compliance is different. For example, someone may host a dinner party, and anything less than one hundred yuan per table is considered inadequate; for Western food, anything less than five yuan per person would be embarrassing for Mr. So-and-so. Very well, so be it. When settling the bill, they simply record one Chinese meal as ten meals or one Western meal as five meals.</p>
<p>At the same time, all matters, large and small, public and private, must be discussed and resolved amidst the clinking of wine cups.</p>
<p>This is the true meaning of "thrifty cuisine."</p>
<h3 id="e77">Quiet Chengjiang <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Qianfei</p>
<p>Leaving behind the lovely Shipai, I traveled a thousand miles, arriving in Chengjiang as if in a dream.</p>
<p>Wasn't the fragrance of eucalyptus spreading through the night in Shipai, the mountain scenery of the tea gardens, and the lake views in the bamboo forests all like a dream?</p>
<p>I remember how, in the moonlight, the moon shone on the green tiled roofs, reflecting silvery light, and the lake was like a mirror. Occasionally, a crow would fly across, casting a shadow on the rippling water. The evening breeze gently swayed the bamboo forests, blew through the trees, and through the trees, a myriad of lights.</p>
<p>Now, now everything has become a dreamlike past. The new-style buildings with red walls and green tiles have been replaced by a dilapidated ancient temple. The mud pagoda is crumbling, the cobwebs are in broken walls, and the ground is covered with dust that rises with the wind. We sat on wooden planks supported by mud bricks, and the professor stood in front of the only blackboard. Picking up the chalk eraser, I unconsciously cried out:</p>
<p>"It's so hard to erase." So the blackboard was rubbed roughly by the hard chalk, making a scratching sound. Knowing smiles hung on everyone's lips.</p>
<p>If we were happy, we would go outside to bask in the sun, sitting on the steps of the courtyard, with dry mud cracking, and small, newly sprouted flowers budding. The air was quiet, and only the professor's voice was heard. A mischievous and annoying crow would often fly by, squawking "ah...ah..."</p>
<p>The clock hanging on the short wooden frame chimed "dong...dong..." In our memories, it evoked the octagonal pavilion of the past. How many hearts, how many footsteps, had echoed within the clock's sound in the octagonal pavilion! Let's all rise together.</p>
<p>We couldn't continue in the classroom, so we had to go to the trees. The slender leaves of the eucalyptus were already a memory for us. Here, there were only sparse cypress trees, stretching straight into the sky. In the quiet night, we could no longer smell the fragrance of the eucalyptus.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching thing in the dormitory was the bamboo framed window, with white paper panes. Through the broken window, one could see the people inside the room, how quaint!</p>
<p>In Shipai, when we turned on the tap, tap water would gush out. But now, the tap was gone. No matter how the water carrier strained at the carrying pole, the pool remained dry. The Cantonese people had to take a bath only once every few days. However, sometimes, if they gave the villagers a few cents, they would bring in mountain water, even though it was dirty and might have small insects swimming in it. Still, many hands lathered soap and scrubbed clothes, while their hearts would return to lovely Guangdong, with its green hills and clear waters everywhere.</p>
<p>In the evening, the dim kerosene lamp emitted a faint yellow light. Black heads were bent over the wooden planks resting on mud bricks, working quietly. Only the sound of dogs barking in the night could be heard, and terrifying thoughts would slip through our minds.</p>
<p>Under the lamp, those who were sick wrote letters home with tears in their eyes, quietly sending their heartfelt thoughts back to their beloved hometown, to their sweet homes. But, a thousand miles away, let us pursue them in our dreams.</p>
<p>The small county town became lively from then on. Every day, students hurried through the only two lively streets. Every market day in Chengjiang had our participation.</p>
<p>Unfolding before our eyes was an unfamiliar environment. Although the transportation here was too arduous, this place was an important area in the rear.</p>
<p>In our lives, we gradually came to understand and recognize this new environment and unfamiliar people. The lake views, mountain scenery, and cypress forests of Chengjiang were no less than those of Shipai. However, the air here was really too suffocating, as if surrounded by high mountains pressing down on Chengjiang. We could only see people living hard and in poverty, and the affairs of the outside world seemed distant to them.</p>
<p>We love our hometown, but we love our motherland even more. In this remote rear area of the motherland, let us work hard to develop a new community with our Chengjiang feelings.</p>
<p>The roaring torrent of the Xian Lake in Chengjiang symbolizes that the quiet Chengjiang will one day roar as well.</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>However, to conduct an actual investigation, one might be able to obtain some evidence. Therefore, two people were left behind to keep watch, prepared to protect Zhu Lin, while the rest went away.</p>
<p>At this time, Yu Wen had already gotten up and stood beside Zhu Lin. He wanted to leave, but feared leaving too abruptly and being recognized by the maidservant. If he stayed, he would face the same danger. So, he became uneasy; but he had to endure. He thought:</p>
<p>'Zhu Lin, this is a chance to test if you are a comrade!'</p>
<p>The maidservant did not pay attention to him, because she had accumulated so much to say and was pouring it all out to Zhu Lin:</p>
<p>"Miss, look, my hair is really white! Miss, since you left, I haven't been able to close my eyes in peace. That bandit who kidnapped you, trampled on my toes until they still hurt! That bandit was so cruel, he killed without blinking! Miss, don't you think? I say, if we could just catch that one kid, that would be enough. Let me cut him to death piece by piece. If he doesn't die, I'll make him suffer! Miss, don't you think? If I didn't want to leave some merit for the afterlife, I would really say that kid was not born of a human mother! He was born of beasts!'"</p>
<p>Yu Wen couldn't bear it any longer. He turned around and glared at the maidservant, signaling: "Do you recognize me? Shut up!"</p>

<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>——Battlefield Notes——</p>
<p>Eastward flows the Han River, the sunset is dim,</p>
<p>At the top of the building,</p>
<p>I get drunk and want to dispel my sorrow;</p>
<p>Alas, by Parrot Island, a traveler</p>
<p>Meeting you and then seeing you off.</p>
<p>Autumn had already arrived, but Hankou was still engulfed in the heat wave. Especially after lunch, the indoor thermometer often read above ninety degrees, causing one to sweat profusely. "Didn't you say you wanted to go to Parrot Island? Old Tai is waiting there!" Shi Jianxiong suddenly ran in from outside and urged me. He had just returned from a raid around Xuzhou and was planning to rest in Wuchang for a few days before heading to Xianning with his troops. Shu Yunpeng, from the Ministry of Transportation's Battlefield Service Corps, was also soon leaving Hankou for Hunan, so Old Tai had specially chosen that famous scenic spot of "fragrant grass withering and flourishing again" for a farewell meal.</p>
<p>Speaking of Old Tai, one immediately felt unspeakable joy. After returning from France, he taught at Jinan University. He was just like his brother, Shuangqiu, always wearing a blue worker's uniform. He was tall and walked somewhat like Charlie Chaplin. From the outbreak of the Shanghai War until the National Army's withdrawal, he was determined to emulate Ban Chao. "Stop fooling around! You're just a scholar. You want to join the army!" His wife mocked, seemingly unconvinced. "Then you just watch!" Old Tai protested. Before long, he received a telegram from General Zhang Fakui, ordering him to go to Ruichang immediately, thus fulfilling his wish. When I saw them on Jianghan Road, they were already fully armed and about to depart for the battlefield.</p>
<p>Life on the battlefield was naturally not "easy," but realizing that one was participating in a great era and being able to participate oneself was very enjoyable. Moreover, for the sake of the motherland, any highest material enjoyment could be completely sacrificed. Old Tai resolutely rejected the offer from Shanghai University and went to serve at the front. Who says intellectuals shouldn't do this?</p>
<p>When we arrived at Parrot Island, everyone was covered in sweat. Old Tai and the others had already arrived. We each took out the farewell wine and delicacies we had brought and gorged ourselves upstairs in a teahouse. Jianxiong talked at length about the victories at Taierzhuang, speaking endlessly. He also solemnly took out General Li Zongren's photo for us to admire. The photo was taken on the platform of Taierzhuang Station. General Li stood before the station nameplate, full of spirit, inspiring awe.</p>
<p>The sun was about to set, so we bid farewell to Parrot Island. Old Tai knew that I could compose a few old-style poems and insisted that I "repay" him with one. Under the pressure of the modern-day Ban Chao, I casually hummed the first quatrain.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Face <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>Even foreigners, no, Westerners, say that Chinese people are most concerned about face. This statement can naturally be interpreted in two ways: positively, China is a land of ritual and righteousness, and everyone wants to protect their reputation, let alone their face, and is unwilling to do evil and be laughed at; negatively, it means that they only care about face and not about substance, and therefore delay many important matters.</p>
<p>What the Westerners say is probably mostly correct. However, the face we often see is mostly on the negative side, which is truly regrettable. Isn't it so? In the past, being able to walk around in government offices was considered having face, being able to get free tickets and ride first-class trains or luxury liners was considered having face, and driving a car and killing someone without having to go to court, just paying a few dollars, was considered having face… Nowadays, extravagant weddings and funerals that waste money and labor are considered having face… There are so many examples that I can't list them all.</p>
<p>Why do they want such face? In a nutshell, it is nothing more than wanting to gain some vanity and hear people praising them. Therefore, those who have no face, or whose face is not yet great, will spare no effort to strive upwards, either attaching themselves to powerful figures in the government or clinging to their coattails, in order to reach high positions, or sticking firmly to the tail of a fine horse, so as to travel thousands of miles. Even more shrewd people use the method of "puffing up their face to look fat." Fatty Dong is a prosperous man. When he walks in front of people, he looks so impressive, while those who are pale and thin cannot compare. Helplessly, he can only puff up his cheeks to make himself look fatter. Grand Tutor Yan in Prince Kai's mansion was willing to have Lord Zou beat his face black and blue so that he could file a lawsuit before the emperor and regain face. This can also be considered such a shrewd method.</p>
<p>Since face is so precious, those who don't have it spare no expense to get it. Then, those who already have it naturally won't easily let it go, even unto "death." Thus, under the important motivation of preserving face, many wonderful things happen:</p>
<p>Clearly afraid of fighting with someone, yet they roll up their sleeves and wave their arms, shouting, "Come on, come on!" As soon as the other person rushes forward, they turn around and run away, saying in a serious warning tone, "If you have the guts, don't run! Wait for me to call my brother!" This way, face is preserved.</p>
<p>Clearly afraid of their wife, yet they say, "Spare me the mischief." Afraid of their wife to the point of kneeling, yet they say, "Stealing a moment to practice New Year's greetings." Ren Huan of the Tang Dynasty put it even better, using a "living Bodhisattva," "nine sons and a mother," and "Kumbhanda" to explain why he had to be afraid. This way, face is preserved.</p>
<p>There are countless such daily trifles. Zhao Tuo, King of Yue of the Han Dynasty, said he was "merely amusing himself," and Ruan Zhongrong of the Jin Dynasty said he "couldn't avoid vulgarity, so he just went along with it." Both of these can be included in this category, showing that the need to preserve face has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>I think the ancients who were best at preserving face can be considered Meng Zhifan as the first. After being defeated and fleeing for his life, he left one chariot behind, indicating that he "stood alone against the enemy" and "covered the retreat." That was already wonderful. When entering the city gate, he had to "urge his horse and say, 'It's not that I dared to lag behind, but the horse wouldn't go forward,'" further indicating that he didn't need face. This made it so wonderful that even Confucius repeatedly praised him for not boasting. In fact, he was boasting and then boasting again, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Writing this far, some people may think that I am mocking face and not approving of it. That's not entirely true. I naturally approve of positive face, with "no room for criticism." Even for negative face, I think that before the Three Dynasties, people were afraid of being too concerned about face; after the Three Dynasties, people were afraid of not being concerned about face. Wanting face is always better than being a male thief or a female prostitute, doing anything and everything.</p>
<p>Today, there are really too many "shameless" people who are "burnt and battered" and insist on "standing tall." And there are also many "ghosts" who "cut off humanity" and "stir up trouble with the wind." They are all brave men who are not afraid of the stench of blood, which truly makes me miss face! Even if I know it's "fake," I think it's not much harm!</p>
