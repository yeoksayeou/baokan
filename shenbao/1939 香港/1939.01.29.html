<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>全國士紳應負之責任</h3>
<p>— 王曉籟</p>
<p>目「八一三」迄今，我國與×人作殊死戰，有我無×，有×無我。目前國家民族之生命已不絕如縷，任何國民自當急起直追，慷慨赴難！今我天縱英武之領袖，方鞠躬盡瘁與　×相周旋，矧為國民一份子者又將如何困心衡慮淬厲奮發以供國家驅策：庶幾過去為抗戰而流之軍民鮮血不致完全擲諸虛牝，而國家民族亦得在萬重難關中轉出一線生機。</p>
<p>雖然，我最高領袖日理萬幾，刻不暇給，勢難躬親與各地民衆一一相聯擊，乃貴乎有地方英秀傑出之士出而倡導，擴大其服務桑梓之範圍，而盡捍衛國家之責任。前讀領袖昭告全國士紳之皓電，對於此點再三可囑，語重心長，欽佩無已，皓電特注重於「推行兵役」與「開發地方經濟」二事，請申論之：</p>
<p>（一）今日對又戰事旣為全民抗戰，自當人人執干戈以衛社稷，地方士紳及其子弟在平時席豐履厚，養尊處優，在今日正可躬為表率，為民先驅，民衆自必相率景從，較諸政府法令尤有應驗，可以斷言。余不敏嘗於「八一三」戰役以前，不計年齡，參加上海市之公民訓練，不但體魄獲得鍛鍊，日益强健，而精神上亦特感愉快；再兒輩亦早於數年前使入軍校，以期他日學成，為國家効力於疆場之上。全國士紳深明大義者何可勝數，誠能以事實表現，響應我領袖之呼籲，則自信可於最短期間蔚為風氣，然後政府趁勢利導，便可事半功倍矣。</p>
<p>（二）我領袖又昭告國人云：「以我國物產之富，人力之盛，果能組織精密，運用靈活，則我經濟持久一端卽足以制×人之死命」，此所以勉我士紳積極協助政府開發地方經濟為充實長期抗戰之資源，奠立未來建國之基礎者也。竊覺我國少數民族資本固因遭受强鄰經濟之壓迫，不獲正常發展，而華北東南等地更為日本軍事的以及經濟的侵略所摧毀，幸我西南西北之物產人力，較諸華北東南並無遜色；而國家對於開發戰時資源之需要，尤屬迫切萬分：吾人自應乘此時機，遵照領袖皓電及政府法令，力矯過去專力都市建設之誤，依一定計劃及組織，積極開發內地。惟吾人須注意者，經濟建設，務須遵照中山先生民生主義，不可祗為少數人打算，而應以實現「人人都有工做，大家都有飯吃」為目的：此不但針對現實問題，而且使未來新中國之建設及新社會之改造亦可藉以減少無數量之流血與磨擦，凡吾士紳似當再三致意也。</p>
<p>居嘗自思：世上最偉大之力量，决非以數字所可估計，日本侵略者夙以好大喜功見稱，而經此十九個月來之抗戰，無論其財力兵力皆已捉襟見肘，其窮迫之窘狀乃均有數字可供左證，其終不免於慘敗崩潰，乃為勢所必然。反之，吾國之偉大，乃不可以數字計。余最近曾遍歷西南諸省，益信吾國之偉大之不可以數字計，而西北諸省之偉大，更不在西南諸省之後。雖然此一大片處女地决非一朝一夕之力，一手一足之烈所可開發，凡吾士紳，尤當向海內外各界廣為宣傳，俾知我國不僅有力堅持抗戰，亦且具備抗戰必勝之條件，最後勝利之期必不在遠矣。余書至此，不覺發生無限興奮與期待之情，深望人人努力領袖皓電中所昭示之「四幹」，而屛絕其所警戒之「四廢」，全國同胞尤其是士紳先生其共勉之哉。</p>
<h3>中華民族的再生（其二）</h3>
<p>— 蔣宋美齡</p>
<p>在上星期（見十九日第二版）的那篇文字裏曾經說明，我們對於中華民挨的再生有堅决的確信。然而要把信念變成事實，我們必須從理想演經成實際的行動</p>
<p>從前希臘哲學家蘇格拉底訓練他的弟子，要他們『諒解自己』，無疑地他是要大家作一個客觀的冷靜的自我分析，以作改善自身的基礎。</p>
<p>要建設一個新穎的，强盛的，統一的中華民國，我們每一個人都首先應當作深切的自省，對於過去的失敗，以往的錯誤，都得嚴刻地檢討，坦白地自承，然後方能在未來的時日中，補救失敗和改正錯誤。</p>
<p>我們所收穫的惡果，乃是自己播植的種子，過去若干年來，我們弛緩的風氣，發展成不普遍地況滯的習俗。若使我們的國家在國際間成了時代的落伍者，那末除了祇能怪自己，不能怨尤別人。</p>
<p>日後要是能從碧血和灰燼之中挺生出一個　有光輝生命的新中國來，那末，那些處在負責地位的人們，一定將覺悟，他們必需自動地負起担子來，盡他們最大的義務，把所有的精力，思想以及智慮貢獻到福國利民的工作上面，不然他應該引咎自退。</p>
<p>要收拾戰後殘局，重建中國，人格是極端重要的。須要心靈的正直，行為的純潔，而最要緊的還是淸明的良知，當然，還須要切實的智慧。</p>
<p>個人的行為是續成良好人格的模型，所以我們祇要改良我們的生活，復活我們對公對私的責任觀念，就可以親自建立起崇高的道德，由此而產生一種力，在整個民族的冉生中，作有效的貢獻。設若我們不能開鑿我們自救的道路，那就辱沒了我們的祖先。</p>
<p>凡是處在負責地位的人們，縱令他祇有一分的能力，就得竭誠地憑看他這一分能力做去，這不僅為了國家應當如此，卽就個人着想，為了避免素餐尸位的醜名，避免在國家危難中故意推諉責任的詰責，也得如此。</p>
<p>凡是達反大衆利益的行動，我們都應當加以嚴格的批判，對於那些表面上裝着熱心公務的食祿居位的人們，都得加以毫無瞻徇的檢討。在另一方面，假使那些由國庫贍養名在仕籍，而委棄責任，負有罪疚的，將予以嚴厲的處分。</p>
<p>傅令嘉獎對于那些負責而賢明的人們，乃是最低限度的報償。</p>
<p>我國從前所有的那些腐化貪污的　瑕點，凡我同胞，誰都有淸滌它們洗刷它們的責任。緊跟着貪污的後面，就是那影形不離的畏葸怯懦。我們應當永遠記得，我們的國恥，我們甲午戰後被割領土的恥辱都是貪污懦怯兩者所聯合造成的結果。現在，我們已有機會來洗去這歷史上的污點了。前線英勇的軍士犧牲着他們的生命，這就足以使我們不再顧慮自身的安全。祇有喪盡了天良的漢奸，他們利用了安全。直接或間接地侵吞着救國抗戰的公款，辜負了英勇戰士，他們的臉上，才會不　起羞慚的紅　來。每一個在後方的人們，應當毫無隱藏地注意到，所有的力量，所有的金錢，都完完全全用到抗戰建國的工作上，這工作正使許多士在兵犧牲，無數民衆在受難的呢。不僅因為我們國家的命運，比了甲午那個時候，遭遇着更危殆的境遇，並且因為我們要在歷史的記錄中，留下正直的勇敢的令名。</p>
<p>我們過去的瑕點，很久以前，蒲克（Hdmund　Bnrke）在他的著述中已經形容過，他道：『食污給我們的禍患，更甚於數萬萬的債務；它驅除了我們軍士的勇敢，它剝奪了我們當局者的智慧，以及我們政治機構中最重要部分的信用。』我們誰會願意這種苦痛敎訓的舊課重溫嗎？大家當然一致會說「不願意」的。那末，每一個官吏對于他所獲得的酬報，從國庫中所得的俸祿，也就是人民直接間接地貢献出來的血汗，戰戰兢兢地永遠把它看作絲毫不容茍且的東西，還有比這件事更急切重要的嗎！</p>
<p>受國家俸祿的人，誰都不能忘記，也不容他們忘記，他旣享用了人民賦稅，他就是人民的公僕。必須以提高純潔，以眞正為民服務的兩種觀念作為一切行勵的準繩。</p>
<p>從前官吏為人民主人的腐化思想，在我們的腦海裏應當驅之唯恐不遠。</p>
<p>從自由的火焰裏，我們將鍛鍊出一個新的認識：一切完課納稅的民衆有權享受良好而公止政府的恩惠，這個政府，不惜任何代價必得名副其實地為人民謀福利。</p>
<p>若使政府果能如此，人民必然富庶，人民富庶，國家必盛，繁榮的國家必定和平而强勁。</p>
<p>國家到了和平富强的境地，那末，一個新中國，將像寓言上傳說的那隻　　的鳳凰那樣，從然她的灰盡中，復活起來，眞正地達到那個拉丁字（RESURGAN）所預言的目的：」我將再生」。</p>
<h3>中國在戰鬥（二）</h3>
<p>— 蘇聯·卡爾曼作</p>
<p>—自譯一月一日莫斯科消息報—</p>
<p>新中國的軍人</p>
<p>早晨在陳誠將軍的司令部裏得遇周恩來先生。他很淸瘦，樣子很疲乏，用他那因睡眠不足而發紅的眼睛環顧四周的人，他是奉蔣總裁之命主持長沙大火眞相調查工作的。</p>
<p>在岳州軍隊的指揮官陳以濟（譯音）親自把沿鐵路作戰情形講給我聽。他已經三十一歲，可是看上去至多不過二十五歲。他很活潑，樂觀，他用　步在房內，來，去。笑聲很淸脆，說起話來，指手劃脚起勁得很。他在國內和軍隊裏有不退將軍之稱，中日戰爭開始的時候，佔優勢的×軍曾在河北襲擊過他所統率的那一團，這區在中國軍隊西翼內，任務是保衛二保定，日軍為消滅這一團分三路攻保定，那時中國砲隊還沒有由後方趕到，而×方空軍及重砲隊則已全體出動。陳以濟和手下士兵在不斷砲擊和轟炸之下和×人相持了四晝夜。第四天只打剩幾十個兵了，他親自帶他們作短　相接，不幸他肩中了一彈倒下來。這消息一霎時間傳入了每一個士兵的耳中，繼『團長受傷了！』之後有人高呼一聲『團長打死了』！前進的行列不期然地停頓下來，他醒過來站直了，高喊：『團長在這裏，衝！』</p>
<p>慌亂之中日軍急速離開高地，損失步槍機槍無算，兵士們佔了高地照接到的命令　多守了六小時。可是第二彈又突過陳團長的胸，幾個輕傷的兵把他抬到後方去，這一戰日本軍隊的傷亡在二千人以上。</p>
<p>陳以濟在沒有滿休養期限的時候就離院囘隊去了。在台兒莊他曾統率　一旅之衆參加殲滅日×戰。在徐州他的一旅截住了想句圍中國軍的日本軍隊，他奉命要掩護大軍直到脫圍而後止。日軍向他那一旅用飛機投彈，並施放毒氣，等到他的部下死守陣地泰半中毒殉　後，他幫了幾個隨身護從親臨陳地作戰。</p>
<p>中國軍隊終於出了國，但他仍帶了多少士兵繼續支持，並給與日　以重大打擊。『撼山易，撼中國軍難』的豪話因而響徹全國。</p>
<p>陳旅長說：『日本人完了，我們把他們攔住。多少次他們想强　修水進入長沙這一面，但是每一次進襲都給打退。在河的那一岸他們正在築堅固工事；佈鐵絲網；把我們自動毀壞的鐵路修成公路；天天派間諜到我們這邊來。往往是隨便抓一個鄉下人給他手上打一針，派他到戰線去。告訴他那毒是致命的，並且說：十天以內你如果帶囘中國軍隊的消息，我們再給你打一針解毒藥，你就可以活。那些鄉下人一直　到中國軍隊司令都裏去把這種情形講出來。昨天就有兩個這樣的渾人發　驪　，死得非常之慘。鄉下人講被佔領區內日軍種種恐怖手段。日本人因為在那些地方旣找不到吃的東西和住的地方，又找不到路，就在未及避開的居民身上報復。他們殺成百成千的人，事先并施以種種　　，這要　人去　　　　事。</p>
<p>陳　長把　子打　，為上有人扶過一位穿着時髦的婦人，耶婦人在哭，他是這一次被處死刑長沙大火　魁之一的妻子，哭聲仍一陣陣由窗外傳來。樹後發出三聲槍響，陳旅長　　傾聽後把窗子關上說：『這是把他們槍决了。』（以下盤入第三版）</p>

<h3>中國在戰鬥　續第二版</h3>
<p>衡山軍事會議</p>
<p>由長沙到衡山去一定要在晚上，路程是一百廿公里，渡河的時候如果遇到×　是最危險不過，因為等渡船的時例、總是排了幾十輛汽車，成了顯著的目標，衡山最近被×機炸平了，連衡山郊外壯麗的古廟也未能倖免，空襲的時候有幾十個人逃到廟裏去，他們之中許多人都死在頹垣之下。</p>
<p>一個寬敞的舊日學校，如今變成了一個濃密的走不通的樹林，幾十株由山裏砍來的柏樹和松樹插在地裏，全院滿舖了厚厚一層松柏的樹枝，各路戰錢的指揮都聚集在此地，來交換經驗，把結束了的第一期抗戰作一個統計，並籌劃以後抗戰的途徑，此地全中國軍隊的精華，各軍各師各旅的指揮都薈萃一堂了。</p>
<p>會議在破曉時就起始，等到飛機能够活動的時候就停止，到晚上再繼續。</p>
<p>那些代表在沒有開會以前，就在院子裏一組一組地走來走去的談論，或者坐在周圍的岩石上等開會。最令人注意的是年輕人之多。許多書年軍官因為勇敢機警，在幾個月戰爭之內就擢升到重要的位置上去。如果院內走過一位有名的前輩宿將，他們都立正致敬。代表之中瘦瘦的身材不很高的陳誠將軍，是第九戰區司令畏官兼政治部部長，他剛和蔣委員長一起從長沙來。白崇禧將軍修長英俊儒雅，也是蔣委員長最接近的抗戰同志，他所担負的新兵訓本練是抗期戰中最寫要的工作。軍政部長何應欽徵英着匆匆向兩面的人行　，走入會　廳，廳裏人滿了，各人安次序坐下，但一聲『立正』後，大家都肅立起來。蔣委員長綫步走入，他坐在滿裝旗幟的高台上示會請各軍官坐下。各發言者向委員長致敬之後，開始演說，各指揮依次講×人的　點，易受攻擊處。×人怕壞天氣和黑夜，在山裏和離交通綫遠的地方不能作戰。總之他們作戰少一個條件就受不了：日軍要是沒有了砲隊，就完全失却戰鬥能力。他們常常把力量集中在一點上，失却和後方的聯絡，因此就吃了游擊隊的虧。</p>
<p>所有會中演說者論到中國士兵的長處時，都異口同聲讀嘆他們的英勇和堅忍。他們恨透了×人，並且不怕死。他們在山裏沒有砲隊助戰也一樣打得非常之好，他們常常作兩鋒襲擊，而日本人照例是抵抗不了這個。</p>
<p>各指輝官也注意到自己的缺點。他們一定說要加速戰地的傳　，加强各種部隊的聯絡，改善傷兵的醫治。</p>
<p>有空襲警報的時候，各軍官就離座避到山洞裏聽×機軋軋之聲。有一次十五架轟炸機在上面飛過，沒疑心到它們下面有多麼豐富的目標，不知道在這些山洞裏，全中國最優秀的軍事指揮官正在討論覆滅日軍的計劃。</p>
<p>蔣委員長在這有歷史意義的會議上說：</p>
<p>「第一期抗戰結束，我們已踏入抗戰的新階段。為了策劃如何加强我們今後抗戰的力量，我們的軍官和士兵必須分柝第一期抗戰的敎訓和經驗，我們引誘日軍深入我國，把他們的兵力分散各處，粉碎了他們速戰速决的迷夢，因此在這一期裏我們是勝利了。日本克服中國的詭計成了泡影。」</p>
<p>幾十輛偽裝的汽車半夜在山中閃着燈光發出嗚嗚之聲，那些指揮官匆匆道別赴前綫去了。</p>
<p>長沙政府佈告欄裏面寫着救濟長沙大火被災難民所採取的步驟，以及嚴辦那些罪首的消息。所以現在路上又擠滿了一羣一羣囘到城裏來的難民。</p>
<p>後備軍大本營</p>
<p>半夜渡河之後，我們就入了廣西省境。年輕的男女哨兵細查所有過境的汽車，並檢查文件。</p>
<p>中國西南的廣西省在國內佔一個特殊的地位，它的行政，地理，生活情形，和居民的工作習慣，甚至於服裝，都非常別緻，所以一入了廣西省就覺得眞像過了一道疆界。連此地的山都不像山：由平坦的高原上聳起高而直的方尖塔。它們一個接一個成千的顯現在蔚藍的霧似的地平綫上。這一個奇特而偉大的景色，很像是一個藝術家極力想表現的神秘的古希臘建築中的人彩石往，廣西人說按科學的考據，廣西省從前實在是海洋的底，說這些石柱是水底中流冲成的。山裏面有許多洞，長及幾公里，洞內有奪目的景色，偉大的地下宮殿，富麗堂皇的拱門主榔，峻險的懸崖絕壁，潺潺下瀉的瀑布，眞嘆奇觀。大自然在此創造的景物，竟是建築天才不能實現的一個虛幻夢境。</p>
<p>廣西人利用這些山洞來避空襲。廣西省城桂林幾於無日不遭×人狂暴轟炸。他們把一條一條的街　全毀了。成千的人變得無家可歸，也全虧每次空襲警報發得其時，城內生命的犧牲比較還少。</p>
<p>每一次警報一經發出，全城立刻離位，幾萬人像潮似地在街上湧，店家住戶都急急上門，一刻鐘之後，全城若死，人羣已經在城外向山裏去。由高山峯上下望全城，如在掌上。飛機聲近了，十八架雙發動機的轟炸機，有驅逐機掩護，在高空飛翔，等一會兒該有爆裂聲響了，可是出乎衆人意料之外；飛機不投彈，這麼在頭上面過云了。一會兒遍山滿城都是由天上落下來的傳軍，傳單上寫着荒膠的字句。</p>
<p>躱在山裏的人恨極了，不等看完就把傳單撕碎，就地堆起來燒，那十八　飛機掉頭又向城上面飛，幾十個重量炸彈落到城裏，山都像給震動了，飛機為避去高射砲的轟　，都個別分散一來一去的轟炸市區。人們用呆了的目光看他們的房子塌下去，許多人甚至在哭。</p>
<p>日本把傳單丟給廣西省的居民幷不是偶然的，且廣西人放下他們的槍桿也不是偶然的。</p>
<p>廣西省是中國民衆後備軍的大本營，全省一千四百萬人口之中二百五十萬人會作戰，受過軍事訓練，每一村的鄉下人工作之後都有二小時的軍訓。受軍訓的有大學生，中學生，政府機關服務人員和婦女，中國軍隊裏有五十萬兵是廣西人，每一個高中畢業的廣西人都有班長的資格。</p>
<p>在這一個比較起來幷不饒富的省份裏，識字的百分率很高。廣西居民百分之六十四受過敎育。每一個廣西人很徵然講本省的戰鬥能力，講廣西人在自衛戰裏所有的榮譽責任。廣西人壯强健康，能吃苦耐勞。此地的婦女從來沒有鑼過足，和男子一樣挑担，這在湖南湖北很少見的。看了廣西婦女飛種健美，你就不能不讀賞，一對又大又括靈的眼睛在象牙色的臉上閃閃發光，她們用有力而富肌肉的手搖船上的重槳，提了很重的桶子担子，走起路來還是那麼輕快。廣西婦女的射擊也很優良，她們和男子一樣能忍受一切行軍之苦。一路直到貴州省境，我們儘看見靑年男女學生軍的隊伍全副武裝地受戰略，射擊，建築，行軍的訓練。</p>
<p>對妥協之咒詛</p>
<p>我們漸漸轉入山中，有時脚底下盤綏一層乳白色的雲霧。路是幾年前修的，路旁岩石上有一個碑是紀念築這條路因暑熱疾病和失足下跌而殉職的工人的。這些山之中藏着無限的寶藏。煤層就在地面上，幾於俯拾　是。有一天此地將燃起隨爐之火，山洞裏將有滿載　石石炭五金的火車來來去去，瀑布洪　之聲將發自電廠鍋輸之中。在今日，從這幾百萬噸豐富的貯藏之中所取出少量的煤，只溫暖了一個窮人的茅舍。</p>
<p>再過一道疆界我們就離開貴州了。從灰色的高在雲上的山岩上我們降到當饒的四川山谷裏。長江兩岸的果園，無涯的稻田，全給一層臘月之霧的灰　籠罩着。我們離開長沙之後巳經走了一千五百公里路。道路向長江一面很峻峭地下去。轉灣處突出於河面。擴展在羣山之上的是一座大城，低低的灰雲覆在它上面，那是重慶！—中國的臨時首都。</p>
<p>重慶早在漢口失陷之前，事實上已成了中國的重要中心，所有政治組織，中央機關，以及北平南京上海出來的著名藝術家，文學家，科學家，只要不直接參加前線工作的都集中在重慶。</p>
<p>一看就可知道重慶人口之密。路上擠滿了汽車洋車和成千的人。街道上的人非常活動興奮。現在正當宣傳週，每一個街角上一堆一堆的人圍着宣傳者聽他們報告戰爭消息，以及全國各地傳來的急起響應政府軍事處置的民衆呼聲。這一個戰爭用空前的速度推行了鞏固中國民衆的工作，他們相信自己必勝。一九三九年恰巧和第二期抗戰同時開始，中國在檢討衡量自己的力量，在作統計，在動員中國有受過軍訓的軍隊凡二百四十師。</p>
<p>武漢淪陷不到兩月，所有在保衛武漢大會戰裏的軍隊損失巳經全部補充好，幾十萬生力軍準備參加隊伍。</p>
<p>軍隊一切必需品都很充足，去年豐收，大量食糧得以團積起來，供給士兵和居民。</p>
<p>中國民衆知道×人巳經精疲力盡，知道淪陷區域之內千千萬萬的人巳起來奮鬥。</p>
<p>中國民衆咒組所有夢想『和平』和投降的漢奸。</p>
<p>『堅决抗戰到底，直到×人整個毀減。』這兩句話，像烈燄似的，在中員全副力量來推翻×人的民衆的心動燃燒着。</p>

<h3>最近日本內部的情況</h3>
<p>夏雲節譯自蘇聯眞理教　（續完）</p>
<p>這種宣言是要勸導一般民衆忍受飢餓而不發一怨言的。但營養不足的結果，却使得日本勞動大衆的健康日益衰萎。據一家報紙的報告，目前東京就有十五萬四千人患肺癆病。因肺病而死的數目也日見增加了。一九三六年，單單東京一地，在八萬零八百三十六個死人中就有一萬四千九百二十五人是息肺癆病的。</p>
<p>在這種惡劣環境下，日本勞動大衆就祇有看見了一條出路。但，那些給統治階級所　養的改組派却出賣了工人階級的利益，使他們的罷工歸於失敗，至為統治者所屈服。</p>
<p>日本的勞工大衆又想把社會民主黨變成聯合戰綫的政黨。所以，在一九三七年四月卅日總選的時候，社會民主黨因為得到工人的擁護、便搏得了三十七票，比較一九三六年的十八票使超出了一半以上。但，社會民主黨的領袖們又一次出賣了工人階級。其中的一個領袖竟公然宣稱『內閣應採取如同希特勒和莫索里尼一樣的斷然政策。』</p>
<p>在本年內（一九三八）許多大工廠的工友們便走到社會民生黨領袖們的前頭，準備為要求加薪來一次有力的龍工。日本報紙曾報道過『工潮正在增長着，罷工的次數一月一月的增加，罷工的範圍也漸漸擴大開來，參加罷工的成份有醫生，有女工，差不多各界都有。』</p>
<p>大量××</p>
<p>在日本祇要對軍閥稍有些微的批評，便有被捕的可能，（有許多工人巳獲得這種待遇了），從這一點，我們便可以看出日本這種××的侵華戰爭是不為一般民衆所掬護的。這種反戰情緒的高漲從什麼地方可以看得到呢？我們都知道日本曾公佈了要實施全國徵兵總動員法案。可是這法案公佈之後，許多工人竟然拒絕到動員站報到，這就是一個例證。同時，從前　受傷歸來的士兵那種慘狀也給予他們一個深刻的印象，使他們更進一步的覺悟到這種××的侵華戰爭，得益的祇是那些布蘭喬亞和軍事的冒險家而巳，他們自己就祇有受害。</p>
<p>現在正領導着一般勞動大衆來進行反法西斯反軍閥的冒險行動的英勇鬥爭。</p>
<p>現在，日本普羅列答利亞特政治勢力的增長，罷工的浪潮，就是促使日本政府惶恐不安的主力。同時，日本在華的軍事胃險行動再要砥畏下去，那麼，她的內部形勢就必然要走上更嚴重更惡化的一個階段。</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>吳佩孚斥×謠言</h3>
<p>據美聯社廿八日北平電：吳佩孚的代言人，對於日方最近宣傳有關吳氏出為傀儡的謠言，怒加否認。由此更可見×奸陰謀的無恥與無聊。但亦可見×奸對於不願為其利用者不惜造謠評　的惡毒。吳氏過去能够　　民族大義，不受×人漢奸污辱，不僅為央氏個人光榮，亦為中華民族光榮。我們始終希望吳氏堅持大義，愛護祖國，為「已保晚節，為人間存正氣。我們更望其他為日×漢奸包圍誘脅的人，都能書其大仁大勇，保留淸白，力持芷義，化除黨派成見，　泯內部消耗，認淸共同×人，××日本的侵略者。」</p>
<h3>××漢奸新醜劇</h3>
<p>日本侵略者鑒於內外危機的日趨嚴重，鑒於我國堅持團結抗戰到底，又將從根打破他們『速戰速决』的計劃，因此一面固然不得不『竭滯而漁』，加緊對國內及佔領地的搜刮，準備與補充其更大的進攻；一面更不得不加緊實行『以華制華』的陰謀，排演『在中國樹立中央新政權』的醜劇。</p>
<p>×奸趕排『中央新政權』醜劇的用意，第一是企圖統一强佔地區的漢奸傀儡政權，加强具統治力量，以便控制與刦奪全部有生力量無生力量一，支持更瘋狂的侵略軍事。第二是利用『主和』『反共』等口號，麻痺我人民，分裂我團結，停止我抗戰，進而到達滅亡我國家民族的企圖</p>
<p>最近在北方擴大宣傳『吳佩孚親日主和』，在南方則以日方御用報紙××日報和汪精衛私辦的××日報為中心，擴大宣傳『反共』『停戰』『議和』『親日』，並且捏造謠言，厚幣誘買。其樹立偽中央政權陰謀活動之亟，實為前所未見。</p>
<p>日×和漢奸這種陰謀活動，當其臨於末路窮途之際，更必瘋狂兇惡，原係意料中事，無足驚異。但我們仍須注靦者，第一，任何中華民族兒女，吾人均盼其自尊自重，吳佩孚氏過去為一舊軍閥，然年來處身於魔窟而獨能大義凜然，不為×奸所用，故吾人對之特表敬意。第二，應知一切不能戰勝×好利誘威脅或甘心附逆的人物，在其個人則為自暴自棄，衡以大義則為民族公敵，旣為全國人民所唾棄，更不能藉任何的組織而發生統治作用。第三，汪精衛自暴其親日投降面目以後，即失其招搖撞開出賣民族的憑藉，一般與論為之慶幸，緘屬確當。然而如果就此不加注視，則不僅係屬錯誤，而且是一種罪惡。陳誠張發奎等通電致請緝辦　氏，××××，實為依據抗戰年餘血淚經驗的重要呼籲。現在汪氏不僅不知悔　，並且利用其宣傳工具，一面造謠煽亂挑撥離間，一面與日×及南北澳奸秘密勾結活動，可以看做寬大政策的態果。第四，潛伏着的親日漢奸，今後必將更無忌憚的用『和平』『反共』等烟幕，進行其出賣民族國家的勾當，我各級當局和各界同胞。均應隨時提防？加以揭發，加以打擊。</p>

<h3>陳公哲書法著述展覽　貢献四十年研究所得於大衆</h3>
<p>本報特寫——書法展覽會原是一椿　　　事情，同時展覽用其與著述，可就有些不凡：　　　的個人展覽會，就以這樣不凡的姿態於昨天在金陵酒店出現</p>
<p>據陳君語記者：「此次展覽並非希望從此生意走上門，或是藉此標榜自己。而是着重於將研究所得，貢獻諸社會，俾後進者有所參考，以企「後來」者得能「居上」。這未始不是文化工作者應有的態度。</p>
<p>陳君謂渠研究書法凡四十年，中間走了十五年黑暗的寃枉路。倘照其所得之科學方法學習書法，以十年之時間，可以達到彼二十五年之成就，以此類推，三年者可當普通方法者十年；一年者，可當普通方法者三年。其方法為用筆方面不用軟性之羊毫，而用健毫如狼毫，兎毫等。至於權衡字之好壤，則以幾何曲線為標準。陳君自稱係半科學家，而謙遜非書法家，著有「科學書法」等書，已在商務印書館出版者計有四本，尚有數本方在付梓中。</p>
<p>至於書法之分析，陳君謂點　之重要性佔百分之六十；結構之重要性佔白分之三十；行氣之重要性佔百分之十。倘用十年時間學習書法，照上比例，化在點畫時間應有六年，結構三年，而行氣則僅一年。可知現在一般寫字之毛病，最大結在於點畫之不正確。</p>
<p>至於此次展覽內容：書法著述凡十一種；書法用具凡十種；書法作品凡九種，約百數十幅。皆甚超脫。而最有價値者，厥為渠所發明與創作之：科學磨墨機；字體重心証明圖，書道原素系統圖，玉製篆筆試筆圖等。</p>
<p>在學術空氣淡薄的社會環境中，陳君這樣致力于研究與發明之精神，分明是値得我們矜式的。</p>

<h3>住客聯合會成立</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>希望它能真正的為住客謀福利</p>
<p>在業主的加租和逼　的狂潮稍告平息中，　着因為水費的繳納問題業主和住客之間平地又　起了多少波潤。在這波瀾日漸增長的時候，忽而宣告港　住客聯合會正式成立了，這是一個多末値得一般住客歡喜的消息來啊！</p>
<p>昨天，太陽湘在雲端　老大爺好像擺出陰悟而又冷酷的面孔，不免人打着寒噤，是下午四　多　，思豪酒店的樓頭，馬上熱鬧起來，行頭工會代表，商店的老板，還有敎育界，像穿梭般踏上二樓。闊闊的大堂，差不多塞滿人了。開會的時間還早，大家閒扯閒談，漸漸由國事而轉入了水費的問題，業主與住客之間，不免發生多少糾紛，大家談到這邊，都不覺廢然興嘆！</p>
<p>奏樂完畢，馬古司路化律師，便起把紅幔揭開，香港九龍住客聯合會這幾個金字，便輝煌地映入眼簾。揭　完畢，他便開始把住客聯合會的目的宣述：『這個會的宗旨是慈善的，它不僅是住客們的法律顧問，而且它還繼續着筹辦住客們的免費醫藥，和設立住客們子女的免費學校，以及住客們一切的利益」。說到這裏，他頓了一頓，繼續說起故事來，說的是柴夫小孩和樹枝，大意是說獨枝易折，衆枝難摧，所以希望大家羣業羣力，團結起來，為人羣謀福利！</p>
<p>跟着是主席致詞，因為主席沒到，所以由李澤業代表。繼着由鑒炳泉報告籌備經過，他很明白闡述了加入這個會裏的利益：將來如果會員受到迫遷，沒有效果而須要法律解决的時候，將由總會出面，依法律替代住客辦理，這辦法倒很不錯；雖然訴訟費還沒有說定由誰担負！</p>
<p>此外據說，凡加入住客聯合會的，有甚麼難解决的事和急難，會裏都　以借箸代筹的。會員的利益，據說實在不少，所以要求入會的，非常擠擁。到月前為止，已經有四千四百八十七人，每個人以三塊錢的入會費計算，巳經有萬幾塊錢了，繼續徵求入會的，還不知多少。以這麼豐厚的財力，似這麼雄厚的人力，大家都希望這個住客聯合，能够有很好的成績表演出來！</p>
<p>聽說該會未曾成立以前，會員裏被逼遷及割去水鏢而要求訴理的，巳經有二百多起，可知逼遷和水費的風潮的重大，和社會人士對這個會的關懷。末了，副主席還諄諄的說，要使這個會更普化而為下階層的勞苦大衆謀利益呢！</p>
<p>副主席報告完畢，繼續由來賓演說，大致都是對這個會寄其萬二分祈望之忱的。散會的時候，大家都懷着滿腔的歡快回去，同時，亦都懷着希望該會快些表現成績的心！</p>
<h3>活躍的惠寳人民游擊隊（一）</h3>
<p>— 柔芝</p>
<p>本報特約通訊——惠寶人民抗日游擊隊的產生和發展給全東江人民發出了一個信號——人民自動參加抗日戰爭保衛家鄉爭取民挨解放勝利的信號，意義是非常重大的。</p>
<p>惠寳一帶的人民不少參加過大革命時代的　爭，大革命失敗以後潛伏着不小鬥爭的力量。而惠寶一帶離鄉出外的靑年更有很多接受了時代的使命，自動負起了救亡的責任，在惠陽靑年會和除閒樂社等幾個團體的推動之下，當華南形勢危急的時候，紛紛參加囘鄉工作團，回惠寶一帶活動，進行宣傳組織民衆的工作，動員民衆起來保衛家鄉。由於他們的努力，工作開展異常迅速，民衆的武裝組織也奠定了初步的基礎。</p>
<p>去年十月十二日，×人進攻華南的砲聲在澳頭附近響起來了。工作最深入，和澳頭最接近的淡水，坪山，龍岡，坑梓，葵涌等地，人民在工作團領導之下，發動起來，準備予×人以打擊：這時候所集中的少數武裝就是現在惠寶人民抗日游擊隊的維形。×人在這一帶地方騷擾的時候，朱長成的游擊隊就隨時。擇有利的地形與時間向×人進行襲擊選雖然因為力最的不够雄偉，不曾得到巨大的勝利，但確實巳給×人相當的威脅；同時還協同正規軍一五一師溫旅麻營作戰，堅决勇敢的行動對該部正規兵士起了不小的影響作用。每經一次戰鬥，就擴大了數量，增加了武裝；　時只有十幾個人幾條槍，現在巳發展到×百個人×百條了，而且重機關，輕機關，手機關也都有了。這是很明顯的：惠寶人民抗日游擊隊是在戰鬥中生長和發展的。它說明什麼呢？它說明：抗日戰爭不是使我們的力量削弱，而是使我們的力量增强。誰說人民的力量不大？誰脫抗日戰爭後不能得到勝利？</p>
<p>惠寶游擊隊是以回鄉工作團一部分堅决的團員和當地一部分勇敢的幹部組織的，未正式成立時就自動在麻園，覇岡，橫岡，三四田等處作了幾次戰鬥。由於他們行動的正確，得到當地民衆的愛戴擁護與支持，進而得到了當地防軍的信任，在前月初呈准政府正式成立為「惠寶人民抗日游擊隊」，由積極抗戰的惠陽靑年和南方海員的領袖曾生君任總隊長負責指揮。從這時起，更動員了一批少壯的海員工友前往參加，擴大組織，加速發展，各村壯丁自衛團隊員也有不少携槍自動加入。同時，東莞寶安的一部分目衛隊，在退出東莞寶安後，因為失去了聯絡，也到這裏來會合。因此，游擊隊的聲勢就日益浩大了。</p>
<p>淡水城是上月七日收復的，最先入城的就是惠寳游擊隊。一見×人有撤退模樣，游擊隊就派一部分便衣士兵先行入城，所以維持會的漢奸正在預備逃走，就被他們活捉了三個。×人退後，游擊隊整隊入城，然　號召居民回來，舉行了一次盛大的民衆大會，把這三個狗東西槍决了，並沒有了他們的財產，全城民心大快。</p>
<p>游擊隊的行動是天天一樣積極的。現在雖然因為×人退走很遠去了，這一帶已不是前線，但他們時時刻刻都準備着未來的新的戰國。他們每天黎明起床後，就集合操練學習跑步和基本的技術。早飯後上政治課和軍事課；下午舉行演習野外作戰或巷戰。晚上開會討論和檢討，有時亦露營練習夜戰。（未完）</p>

<p>座談會的意義</p>
<p>陸浮：我們申報自去年底擴充篇幅後，為推進抗戰建國的一個新文化部門！電影戲劇　起見，特出版這一個電影戲劇週刊。創刊以來，蒙各位先進和各位同志的熱烈愛讓和帮助，鼓勵和培植，使我們一方面無限的感愧，一方面更使我們警惕着本身責任的重大。</p>
<p>現階段電影戲劇運動在民族解放鬥爭中的重大作用，諸位當然是知道得很明白；而現階段電影戲劇的情形：如南北電影界的不能負起戰時藝術的任務，新興戲劇的還停留任萌芽時期的惡劣環境中苦鬥掙扎，諸位亦當然知道需要我們更大努力去糾正去推動的。所以，我們為集思廣益，聯絡感情，展開集體的討論，建立正確的理論和批評，推動現階段的電影戲劇起見，特別發起舉行這個「電影戲劇座談會」。蒙各位先進和各位同志熱烈前來參加，不勝榮感！</p>
<p>我們這個座談會的形式是很隨便的，我們希望每一星期或每兩星期能經常舉行一次，每一次在喝喝茶　談笑中，認定一個工作主題做討論的中心，一方面希望在這個座談會中能針對電影戲劇界的現狀作一全面的檢討，一方面使我們同志間彼此有更密切的聯繁。這樣，諸位亦覺得很有意義吧！</p>
<p>討論中心課題</p>
<p>日前，我曾和幾位先進談過這個問題，大家都很贊同，同時，還指出擺在我們眼前的幾個主要工作課題，如：一，建立進步的電　戲劇批判；二，建立正確的電影戲劇理論；三，推進新階段的電影戲劇運動；四，展開電影戲劇淸毒運動……等，我們卻需要加以詳確的集體討論。</p>
<p>今天，我們擬定討論的中心課題是「建立進步的電影戲劇批判」，因為批判工作在推動電影戲劇運動的作用是非常重要的。我們知道，每一事物沒有批判和檢討，是不可能要求它能有正常的發展和進步的·一二八後上海電彩界的飛躍前進，大部份就是進步的電影批評家的努力所推動。文化水準這麼低落的香港，這工作，當然是迫切需要的。現在，我們所要討論的，便是怎樣建立這個批判工作，以及怎樣認淸環境的和時代的需求，確定批判的標準。同時，這個問題的原則决定後，我們幷進一步試以中華藝　劇團今次演出做我們批判的對象，因為她是香港話劇運動的新興的中心團體，這次是第一次正式演出。對香港的劇運是有很大的意義的。希望各位先進和各位同志對這個問題不客氣的盡量發表意見，加以詳確的集　的討論。</p>
<p>幾個重要原則</p>
<p>歐陽予倩：申報電影戲劇週刊主開這個座談會，是有着很大的意義的。今天所要討論的課題，亦是一個重要的工作課題。我們知道，進步的電影戲劇批判，在現階段的電影戲劇運動是有着很大的作用的為了使批判工作能够發揮更大的作用，我們應該建立一個批判中心，建立一個批判的目標。第一批判中心，內容是最重要的，不過內容亦有很多要注意的，抗戰進展到現階叚，初明抗戰的劇本到現在已經有許多足不够了，現在是需要以更新的形式更新的體裁和更新的內容了。這是我們應該特別注意的。內容决定之後，對於表現的技術批判亦是很重要的，因為有好的技術方能表以出好的的內容，使它表現出更充實更有力—第二，批判是有着宣傳的作用的，所以我們是不能隨意的好惡而褒貶，應該有一個正確的共同的目標，這目標，當然就是，對民族抗戰之有無利益為準則。這樣，何者應該宣傳何者不應該宣傳，就有根據。第三，電影與戲劇的批判不能一律的，因為電影的物質條件複什得多，同時，新興的戲劇現在正在艱苦奮鬥的萌芽時期中，還未取得社會的地位，所以我們批評的態度是要比較寬容而輔助其長成的。同時，戲劇方面亦有職業劇團和非職業劇團之分，職業劇團的技術當然純熱一點，物質條件亦當然優好一點，但非職業劇團的工作態度却比較勇敢一點、演出的對象亦比較廣泛，所以我們的批判態度又是有點不同了。第四，因為環境的關係，有些應該批判的使我們沒法于批判，比如八一三以後的上海電影戲戲界，好的少，而懷的多、但壞的背景却有某種勢力的支持，使我們沒法子去執行正確的批判，這樣我們就應該好的去批判，不好的不去批判，讓它在有眼睛的觀衆面前自生自滅，這是一個很好的辦法。</p>
<p>毀滅中的電影</p>
<p>蔡楚生：電影和戲劇這兩姊妹藝術，因為在不同的環境中不同的運用不同的生長，所以質和量上都有很大的差別。剛才歐陽先生說電影和戲劇的批判工作應該分開，這是很正確的。現在，對這個問題，我亦分開來講：先說電影，一二八以後，中國電影的進步，電影批評家是有着很大的貢献的。在進步的文化人的督促，和進步的電影理論和批評的被建立起來，而使電影工作者在這民族生死關頭的刺激下，和進步的文化人新的啓示下，有了空前的醒覺，使過去為藝術而藝術的電影是有着很顯明的轉變·揚棄了舊的渣滓·而和新文化運動配合起來。可是，八一三民族抗戰展開後，一般的新文化運動都隨着抗戰的展開而展開了，作為新文化重要的一環的電影却隨着抗戰的展開而末落。現在，除了在政府支持下的中國電影製片廠和中央電影攝製場在英勇地担負起光輝的任務外，蓬勃一時的電影文化運動，無分南北，都全在進了毀滅的路了。就歷史的進化來說，作為新文化運動的一環的電影，是應該更英勇更活躍地跟着民埃抗戰英勇向前進展，担負起應負的更偉大的任務才對，為什麼相反地大部份走上墜落的路途，有的甚至可說是替×人麻醉我們的民衆奴化我們的民衆呢？這是如何痛心的事實！</p>
<p>毀滅的兩原因</p>
<p>這裏，我們要確定怎樣建立進步的電影批判，就要明瞭電影究竟為什麼會在這抗戰中成為表現得最弱的一環，甚至逃避了而走上背反的途路　這原因：第一就是電影的製作幷不像其他藝術這麼簡單，而需要較多的資本來支持，每一個電影工作者的背後，就站着一個足以支配你的一切（？）的投資者，電影商人，，因為目前中國的電影商人始終還保持着手工業時期的經營方法，一切祇有保守，而沒有展拓，祇有求利，而沒有認識，更不知道電影文化的重大使命，和在民族解放鬥爭中戰時商人所應負的任務，於是在大時代中的暴風雨冲刷下，自然招架無力，而「聽天由命的趨於崩潰而毀滅，甚於　所欲為的走向墮落的途路去，第二，由於中國電影工作者大部份的沒有嚴格的訓練，沒有充分的修養，沒有正確的認識，沒有堅定的意志，同時，又把個人的生活問題和享用看得太重了一點，於是，遇到非常時期的動亂，就鮮有不手忙脚亂，罔知所措，循至相反地任人擺佈了！</p>
<p>勸導商人醒覺</p>
<p>基於上述的兩個原因，抗戰的中國電影就必然地會造成悲慘的結果，這是不可避免的定律。所以，我們要補救這悲慘的局面糾正這嚴重的錯誤，就要針對這些原因，馬上建立起進步的電影劇劇批判來。用我們的血誠，，用我們的口舌，用我們的筆墨去使每一個電影商人和電影工作醒覺起來，使每一個被麻醉的觀衆醒覺起來。</p>
<p>第一，我們要告訴一切電影商人，無論任何一個國家民族，在遇到歷史上空前未有的存亡絕續的危險關頭時，一切正視現實，有內容，有生命，而充滿鼓勵戰鬥情緒的作品，是沒有不被她的國民所熱烈擁護，過去一般電影商人之散佈國防電影營業慘敗的空氣，作為攝製毒素影片的掩護，在這里我們更要嚴正而誠懇的指出：他們所指的國防電影，幷不是眞正的國防電影，而多數是以似是而非的所謂國防電影，將眞正國防電影的信譽弄得一敗塗地。眞正的充實的有意義國防電影是决不會不賣錢的。在决定國防電影一定賣錢的原則下鼓勵他們從事於眞正的國防電影的創造，為獲取較大潤名而醒覺而努力。同時，更指斥出他們如不再醒覺的嚴重危機！</p>
<p>克服口號公式</p>
<p>第二，我們要克服一切口號化的公式化的國防電影的產生，我們要對一切電影工作者嚴正的指出，眞正的國防電影並不是一定要喊出「打倒××」的，或充滿着戰爭或毆打×人漢好的場面的。而是要活生生地現實地對觀衆報告我們怎樣受壓迫，應該怎樣求生存的故事。我們要告訴每個電影工作者，如果沒有相當的技術，沒有正確的認識，再加上缺乏生活的實際體騐，結果是空有一個好主題，也祗是做到生吞活剝的口號公式的積累，而做不出動人的好作品的。至於看錯了所謂「生意眼」而七拉八湊地容納了一些低級趣味的素材進去，那更是要不得的。像這樣的「似是而非」的『國防電影』必然是會使羣衆感到內容的空洞虛泛而覺得味同嚼臘，甚至起了厭惡之感而望以去。至於肉感的，低級趣味的，民間故事的毒素片的製作，我們更要嚴厲地指出它前送的黑暗。</p>
<p>發揮群衆力量</p>
<p>第三，我們的批判工作要深入觀衆階層去，我們對每一電影製作的內容和技術，都要給以詳確的誠懇的而又通俗的批判，以提高每一觀衆鑑賞和取捨的水準。好的我們固是要推讀，不好的我們更要嚴格的指摘，使每一觀衆都不要糊里糊塗跑進電影院。同時更要使每一個有智識的羣衆，明瞭應該怎樣在民挨解放鬥爭中得到良好的精神糧食，和應該怎樣帮助國防電影的建立，從自已做起，以及勸導接近的親友，不要去看有毒素的電影，和積極鼓勱他們去看有意義的眞正的國防電影。這樣，我們的批判就發生了最大的作用，縱使電影商人和電影工作者猶不醒覺，想再糊里糊塗地做下去，亦就不可能了！</p>
<p>推動大衆劇運</p>
<p>關於戲劇·因為這一部門直到現在還未取得社會的所謂「商業地位」，和資本家還沒有密切的關係。所以始終還靠一些對戲劇本身發生興趣，或是把戲劇看成有效的宣傳工具的藝術工作者在艱辛困苦的環境中堅决支持。亦因為這些藝術工作者態度比較純潔，認識亦較淸楚，所以，話劇在中國雖然還是萌茅時期，甚至於無時不在風雨　搖中，但是在八二三民族抗戰展開後，她却在這偉大的烽中畏成起來，而且有超越二十餘年空前未有的輝煌的成就。國內的固不用說了，單就這文化荒島的香港來說，抗戰以來，在中華藝術協進會等文化團體的極力推動下，國防戲劇運動亦是飛躍地向前進了。綜觀過去一年的香港劇運，演出的次數可統計的已達二百餘次，大小劇團現在巳達三四十個，這是一個如何可喜的現象。但是，在這文化的荒島中，因為文化水準的低落，戲劇到現在沒有相當的社會地位，還未能取得廣大羣衆的愛護，我們對這方面的批判當然是要比較寬容，而取着推動的鼓勵的態度。最主要的，除了在技術方面給以提高外，就是應該克服過去一些戲劇工作者為藝術而藝術僅而在狹小的文化圈子裏打滾的錯誤，而極力的推動戲劇大衆化的實踐，使它普遍發展起來。尤其對于一般小劇團，更要給以更大的鼓勵，指示以各方面的經騐，使他們盡量地向廣大的羣衆階層中發揮其煞情和力量。雖然他們大多雖不免幼稚，但他們是不難在鬥爭中長成起來的。</p>
<p>劇運動態</p>
<h3>青年劇協　二次聯演</h3>
<p>靑年戲劇協會，是港九靑年戲劇團體一個總的組織，在統一戰線與提高工作效率的迫切要求之下，該會以嶄新姿態出現於「文化荒島」的香港，宜乎我們於感慰之中，致其無限的願望。</p>
<p>他們去年舉行過一次聯合公演，現在，又再選定由今天（一，二九）起假華南中學聯合公演三晚。今晚第一晚演出團體與劇目有：新聲劇社的「有力出力」；蘆烽劇社的「重逢」；丁丑劇社的「太陽旗下」；旋風劇社的「盲啞恨」；及紅白劇社的「報血忠魂」等五個獨幕劇。明晚第二晚有：學賑會的「三江好」；八一三的「我們的游擊隊」：業餘聯誼社的「黑影」；中華業餘的「最後一計」及廣東劇協留港同人會的「中華女兒一。後晚第三晚有：弓劇社的「死裏求生」；平凡劇社的「還我們的孩子」：及軔鬥劇社的「春之笑」。聞同時還有：中華業餘合唱團，靑年同樂社，廣州鋒社歌詠隊，中華書局同人歌詠隊等參加歌詠、在香港劇壇上、這是一個很有意義的聯合公演。</p>

<h3>靑年戲劇協會萬</h3>
<p>— 蔡楚生</p>
<p>這是一椿非常榮幸的事，在港九靑年戲劇協會，以至於參加這組織的各個單位，前後的幾次公演，我差不多都有機會得在台卜人山人海的觀衆中佔着一個位子。看到他們那不避任何艱難困苦的精神，始終認眞工作的態度，我眞祇有愧死—由於他們的絕不苟且，所以演出的成績都非常之好，每次，都給予我以無限的感動。</p>
<p>以前，香港是曾被議為「文化的荒島」的；話劇，更被議為是「無人境」。現在，不但規模較大的戲劇團體，有了很好的表現；規模較小的團體，也在蓬勃滋長起來了。就九龍方面，就有二十幾個戲劇組織，這些組織並打破了最不易聯合起來的難關——建立一個總的機構，而成立了「靑年戲劇協會」，繼續着幹起大規模的聯合公演來，這和抗戰後上海二十幾個小劇團所組合的「星期小劇場」，同足以交輝南北。</p>
<p>香港，這「荒島」上現在是開遍許多戲劇之花了。這現象，應該是値得每一個注意這島上的文化運勸的人十分高興的事。</p>
<p>自然，這些新茁的花朶，還免不了脆弱，他們多數沒有很多的經驗，沒有很多的財力，沒有很多的人才，而紙是憑着靑年們一腔對國家民族的熱情，來灌溉，來培植，要它很快就能發榮滋長，當然是較為困難的事。因此，我特別希望他們能經常在一個總的機構中，集台一切的經驗，和人力財力，共事灌漑，共事培植，不但在整個戲劇運動中能起很大的作用，同時也使每一個戰鬥單位的工作者，在經驗和技術上有飛快的進步，這是一個展開大衆戲劇運動中，需要而且是必要的工作。</p>
<p>靑年戲劇協會，應該是港九靑年戲劇工作者一個很理想的組織了。無論暫時還有若干避不了的困難，免不掉隔閡，但祇要我們認定這工作在大前提上是對的，那麼我們就應該拿出愛護自己單位的心，來愛護這個總的機構，而在衆人毅力和熱情之下，一切的困難是都可以衝破的！</p>
<p>當着齊年戲劇協會又作第二次大規模聯合公演的今日，我　高呼：</p>
<p>靑年戲劇協會萬歲！</p>

<h3>為今春茶產銷籌改進</h3>
<p>— 謝耀原</p>
<p>分別言之、上海洋莊茶棧為一經銷之機關、產茶區域製茶廠始為實際上之茶業經營者、上海洋莊茶棧貸放金副通資於製茶廠、而經銷其製成茶葉（卽箱茶）上海洋莊茶棧旣負有經濟上之責任、宜如何於製茶廠為必要之監督與指導、然而上海洋莊茶棧組織未臻健全、不克盡其職責、產茶區域　茶廠業務實側重於技術方面、然而經理之者、又多非專才、敎育程度且亦有極低者、筆奢嘗數遇此輩茶商、甚且有以外國需此茶葉何用相問者、至堪扼腕、至於國外市倩之如何、更屬茫無所知、此種深可憾慨之現象、籍者雅不欲故甚具說、然實無以諱之也、內外交相敷衍塞貴、惟以博取利潤為務、習俗相沿、舊規墨守、不足以言茶業之發展、蓋絕非偶然、</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>茶業旣因上述原因趨於衰落、欲謀振興、商人資力有限、學識未充、殊未易為力、故政府統制、實為當務之急、但統制之說、雖　之有年、而一方因商人囿於近利、復多無謂之猜忌、未能與政府切實合作之他方、政府亦並未實際執行、終未獲收宏效、本年政府因統制外匯、並為調整國際貿易、有貿易委員會之設立、隸屬於財政部、茶列為該會統制經營之一種、於是統制乃見實現、今試將統制之現狀作槪括之檢討、</p>
<p>茶葉為有季候性之生產品、商人經營、期前集股設廠、進行製做銷售、無形中亦有其一定之營業步驟、留會統制茶葉運銷之寶　、已在本年茶葉營業進行之後期商人所製做之茶葉已為成品、並巳運輸抵達出口口岸、準備裝運來滬以謀、銷售、貿會頒令實施統制、遽不能運輸出口、商人雖奉侖惟滿、然因未明統制之眞意、一時羣情懷駭、威感不安故在進行中之業務一律停頓、（未完）</p>

<h3>今天足球有激戰　南華南再逢東方　警察對士葛一役亦工力悉敵</h3>

<p>南南乃戰東方、這齣好戲、定然悅目可觀、還記得兩隊首次碰頭、南南五比零大勝、但今天重逢、南南恐難冉有前次的收獲、加以南南球員李天生、麥紹漢、扶傷歸來、還未　可、今天却是勉强登場、</p>
<p>東方自孫錦順中途離隊赴滬後、實力尚無絲毫影響、戰績反而更佳、這無他、一心一德故也、</p>
<p>李四說：「右脚還未消腫、日來練習、改以左脚扣射、也頗如意、」</p>
<p>總之、是役在東方乃想報復一箭之仇、在南南則欲鞏固奪標地位、因此、激戰必不免、</p>
<p>警察對士葛一幕、因於錦標大勢無關、勝負都無足輕重、然而、兩隊工力悉敵、亦有惡鬥也、（球場太歲）</p>

<p>據李國璠對記者稱、他們京定本月卅一日才離滬南下、惟以寒假無事、乃提前來港、在航行中、國基因感冒風寒、熱度高至一百零三、刻下尚在調理中、恐怕未卽全愈、難以登場表演、</p>
<p>今天下午、羅律師文錦文惠兄弟替他們接風、往赤柱別墅練習、蔡永善、何家隊等作陪、</p>
<p>這幾位球人、至有朝氣、球藝相當成就、尤以唐寶嘉與李國璠合作雙打、經巳馳譽申江、去年滬津埠際賽、他倆列入正選、此次南來、定多貢献、</p>
<p>對南華會隊一場、聽說訂於二月五日（星期日）下午二時半在九龍皇囿南　網球場舉行、南華並巳選出（單打）陳志强、陳福南、陳錦滿、（雙打）呂桂芳、馬乃　、李均雄、何顯芹等應戰、五球人榮街列下、唐寶嘉全滬華人單打冠軍李國璠全滬華人單打亞軍</p>

<h3>足球情報</h3>
<p>【本港專訊】香港足球會、近年來人材零落、實力大削、「大檀」威風、消失殆盡、尤其在本屇、該隊出師以來、敗多勝少、無善足陳、有聲於時之「肥史』、因見大勢已過、興緻索然、近來亦不常參予佐戰、茲探悉該隊台柱碧福及史堅拿、不日又離港返英、若是、該隊陣容更不整矣、又聞九龍會之廖亞臣、亦告他去、</p>
<p>昨日南華英文早報登戲一旅港菲籍讀者來函、略謂港菲埠際足球賽、為期巳邇、但未悉港隊代表中、李惠堂及大告山奴二人、是否入選、蘆菲方人士、對此二位遠東著名球人、素來欽仰、若其此次入選、則菲方人士當不少專為參觀而來者云云、</p>
<p>菲埠際足球隊他日到港、共有三場比賽、首場為埠際賽、二三兩場為表演賽、茲有人献議、凡經代表港數出席埠際賽之球負、最好於表演　中、不再選之、若此、則一般技藝良好而未入選於埠際賽之球人、可以在表演　中得有一顯身手之機會矣、按此獻　、甚有道理、不過我華聯隊若取此法、實力影響至大也、</p>
<p>上海國際救濟會邀請李惠堂北上參加之足球義賽、乃定下月二十及廿一日舉行惟惠堂適於其時、在港有埠際賽及廿六日有義賽、未克依期北上、昨據惠堂表示、謂、赴滬之舉、義不容辭、惟希望滬方將比賽改期三月四五日舉行、否則　難應命矣、（東郎）</p>
<h3>光華勇拒米杜息　三與三比春色平分</h3>

<h3>愛麗絲馬寶兒的網球登龍秘法（五）　球場舊侶</h3>
<p>關於發球的手法、我也主張用歐陸握拍法、這、對於迅疾力、準繩、和旋轉力、俱有相當的助力、照我的閱歷、以為女子只要學平打及片打兩種發球之法便足、而永不可學美國式的打發球法、因為在女子的生理上、背部的筋肉斷不如男子强健、勉作扭打、是易於蓄傷背部的肌肉的和筋絡、</p>
<p>我自己所用的片打發球法、是幷無師承的、這是我自己在三藩市的金門囿看男子賽球學來的、但我現時以為這一種發球法所得到的好處、却補不來身力的虛耗、故我也甚望自己能有完全脫離了此種開球習慣之一日、換而言之、便是此舉不足法、現時因用慣了、已成了一種陋習、却一時要改改不來</p>
<p>有許多女網球家、以為自己如果能用球面新打的發球法、則為革地賽的一種殺手鐧、然而我却要勸你們不可作如是想、其寔如果此法用不得其當、則幷不比那平打和球底斬球的不吃力發球法較好、同時、我更想作進一步的有力勸諫、球面　　的發球法、在草地上比賽大可說是完全沒大用的、</p>
<p>我深信我們美國的女網球家必有一日有大多數所不吃力的發球法的、因為發球以不吃力和不免强為主、我更望我的女同志莫思疑我是自私自利者、而想着自秘着一種發球法力求自成一派、須知我是天生的運動家、又幸而有了一位看出我有夭然運動本能的師傅、更由她的循循善透和我自己多時的苦練、才打得出這一手、如果沒有這種種條件的人、如果强要學我、敢信必定終於自糟、又何况如我也有應捨棄此種發球法的感覺呢、總而言之、球面　球的發球法、實在是太難學而為女子所絕不畢應的、</p>
<p>發球的秘訣是永莫將球作壓低的打出、如果在發球時　將球擲高到高出頭頂三尺、而球拍的發動要繞到頤項之下的話、則打出時、球拍應先向天後向前以擊　、至於打出後、球拍應隨餘勢繞至身之左而垂於左足之前、則是借此餘勢使球迅疾飛出、拍之打出餘勢在將了未了前之听以必應垂低、是一種天然的需要、不如是則球出無勁力、在我則為發球之得法否、實在比其他手法的好否尤應重靦、因為這是　衛的集中點、發球得注與否之影響於比賽的勝負問題、實在與棒球的發球和高爾夫球的使捧之一煞那間同其重要、好不好盡在自己於將發未發時所施用的力量和方法</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……情寶初開</p>
<p>Love　Finds　Andy　Hardy</p>
<p>每一部　寫哈地法官家庭的影片、都能給與觀衆新鮮的趣味、這類片子之中、充滿着眞實性、能够近情合理的表現出大量有趣的人生經驗、而其描寫的迫眞、幾令觀衆親身體騐到片中的一切、而感化在這家庭悲歡離合的情緒之中、現在這部「情竇初開』、第四部哈地法官的片子、對於靑春男女戀愛心理、有極深刻迫眞的描寫、安地（麥蓋郎奈飾）大鬧戀愛忙、周旋於三個女子之間、一個是他眞心愛慕的、一個是友人託他看　的、另一個是給他不少幫助、眞摯熱誠的朋友、同時家庭方面、遭遇到一件不幸的事情、安地的外祖母、身患重病、生死未卜、他的母親離家親往服侍、在這種情境之下、他們預備着過一個憂悶的聖誕、但突然的母親帶着好消息囘來、送給他們一個「快慰」的禮物、一家過着狂歡的聖誕節</p>
<p>密蓋郎尼在本片中特別賣力、之巳往數片、有更好的成績、魯意史東飾一沉毅誠懇的長者、是本片中最出色的人物、在原有的演員表之外、更加上一個歌唱女童星裘蒂嘉蘭、她那眞摯動人的表情、淸妙悅耳的歌聲、在本片中也佔一重要之地位、</p>
<p>皇后平安……巴黎蜜月</p>
<p>Parfs　Honeymoon</p>
<p>故事很簡單、所有場面全靠各演員的支撐、演出尚輕鬆可喜、演員陣容相當齊整、可惜演員的支配不甚適合、一部份的演員未能儘展其所長、</p>
<p>故事叙述一個美國西部的百萬闊少、帶着未婚妻到巴黎、因為未婚妻在那里、尚得和舊夫辦妥離婚手續、他便先到一個玫瑰鄉村小住、在那里却遇到當地的玫瑰花后、一個時時叫他麻煩、他呌她『小頭痛』的小姑娘、在無意中發生戀愛、同時他的未婚妻在巴黎、却和舊夫重溫好夢、他便和那玫瑰花后結婚、</p>
<p>片中有動聽歌曲數　、由萍克勞斯貝唱、秀蘭露絲和愛德華霍登、在片中沒甚戲做、愛金　密洛夫、這個以演反角出名的明星、在這里充當諧角、成績也很不差、弗蘭西絲嘉嘉演出活潑而優秀、</p>
<p>東方……瑞士小姐</p>
<p>Swfss　Mfss</p>
<p>故事很簡單、寫兩个賣老鼠軋的商人（勞萊、哈台）、他們忽然異想天開到瑞士去做生意、可是非但生意不曾做着、結果還要罰在旅館裏做侍者、兩个自作聰明的獃子、就鬥了不少笑話、</p>
<p>這裏面有二個歐洲的歌唱家、尤其是那位女的、有很好的歌喉、勞萊、哈台演出與以前的作品沒有什麼兩樣、</p>
<p>大華……同歌共舞</p>
<p>Everybody　Sfng</p>
<p>裘蒂珈倫主演、她的歌喉　然不及狄安娜賽萍來得動人、可也是新人中極出的人才了、本書內容是寫一個戲劇狂的家庭、演出方面一切都編重在喜劇與歌舞、也是一般好萊塢歌舞片的彩色、裘蒂珈倫除歌唱之外、表情也不差、亞倫瓊斯却沒有像『情韻動軍心』裏那樣出色、</p>
<p>新世界……真假武則天</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>一部想利用香艷肉感作為號召的商品、是以一個生性奇淫的舞台紅伶作為本片的中心人物、而以她在舞台上飾演武則天、和荒淫的私生活、作為描寫材料，怪　不經的內容、但可能的迎合低級趣味、儘所謂香艷肉感的場面、也未敢澈底、徒令『鹹濕』觀衆失望、普通觀衆肉麻而巳、</p>
<p>中央……金葉菊續集</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>看過上集的觀衆、總記在得結局時、金葉菊仍被周志誠倫去一對、現在積集中就從這事講起、到金葉菊歸遺為止、劇情無上集緊張而曲折、演來亦非常鬆懈、但是中閒仍有不少地方能博得一部份愚笨觀衆的眼淚、如鄺山笑之被害而入獄、小燕非之探監等、民間故事一貫的作風、還是不能避免、我們不需要有過、就能猜到該片劇情、果然這理想並不錯誤、曹綺文不適宜演這種影片、佈景攝影在華南尚可以過去、收音却是失敗的、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「×馬」</h3>
<p>— 曹衆仁</p>
<p>—戰地旅行新感—</p>
<p>某君來此　談，問起我：「×人的馬被我軍截獲的時候，就低下頭去表示慚愧懺悔的樣子，可有這回事？」我抱愧得很，不但沒有看見過，簡直沒有聽過到。我把許多我方將領騎在俘獲的×馬上的照片給他看，那昂然的樣子，好像並沒有懺悔的表示。不過能找一匹從戰場過來一心要出家的×馬看看，也頗爲有趣，可惜我們無此眼福。</p>
<p>由於某君提起×馬的話題，許多在戰場上過活的朋友都說起他們自己的見聞來。在蘭陵附近的一個寨子裏，一中隊×方的騎兵給我軍包圍住了，到了第三天，在一個堅韌的鐵圍中，顯然沒有突破的希望了。第西天的早晨，有一架×機就在那寨子上低飛，投下一個信號，×機飛囘去以後那一小時，寨子裏有一陣斷續的槍聲，接着又寂然無聲了。不久那寨子就給我軍打開了，那寨子裏橫着四十多個×兵，還有五十多匹×馬：那些馬，有的只剩一隻耳朵，有的只剩一隻眼睛，淋着鮮血站在那兒。其中有幾匹眞正成爲獨眼龍的，到現在還在我們的馬羣裏拖車。×人的馬，樣子倒是很不錯的，胖胖的，毛色狠光鮮。</p>
<p>G參謀長追述在魯南親見那一囘事，觸起了W軍事長的新話題，他說：「×人的馬太漂亮了使我們沒有辦法，一零六師團送給我們的那些馬足夠編成一個游擊隊，其中十幾匹項漂亮的，據說是一種各貴的馬種，速草料都得從他們自己國內帶來的。我們養不起這些步爺馬，抬又抬不動，只好讓它餓死在那農，」某君笑道：「×人的藝術家，亦許可以畫成一幅義馬圖，說那些馬中的少爺被俘不屈，絕食而死。」我在哄堂大笑之後，補敘「朱死的兵」中，×人對自己馬匹所批評的括，他們自己說：「中國的騾馬，看是那惆鬼樣子，又瘦又小，一步拖一步的；一到走起還路來，尤其在泥濘崎嶇的長途上，我們的看是頂出色的馬匹，大不如那些鬼樣子的騾馬，耐苦耐走，不會倒下去。」這倒是中日兩國戰事前途命運的總說明了；×人的馬，象徵了×人的作戰力。</p>
<p>T參謀在蘭封作戰，出入於著名遊竄的土肥原所指揮的騎兵縱隊中十多天，先先後後截獲了許多馬匹，他自己所騎的馬和軍長所騎的都還是那回奪來的。他的「×馬論」也頗爲有趣，他說：「主人的性格常會從他所愛好的對象表現出來；小姐們歡喜巴兒狗，大盜要帶一隻掙獰向人的狼式的狗，這都是主人性格的反映　敵人對於馬匹有一種普遍的心念，這是「×軍」的馬要胖要光鮮，內裏結實不結實可不大注意。我們閒常時候，也把敵馬當作裝飾品；一上戰場，我可要另外選擇一下了。」用馬匹的形態來刻劃暴發戶的心理，從深處想，倒是很雋永的。</p>
<p>在日本方面，也未始沒有人看到這一點；那被犧牲於二二五事件的高橋藏相，不是曾說到他們自己經濟根底上的空虛嗎？魯進</p>
<h3>倒也！倒也！</h3>
<p>— 魯進</p>
<p>誇下了「三日佔上海，十日下南京」的大口底「遠扯隊」，到了一年又半的現在，自然是有些捉襟見肘了，但是中國的軍隊却愈打愈有勁，而且政見都統一了，卽使想慫勇一個傀儡來開開「和平之門』，也徒然暴露自己的惶恐，卑鄙，——這叫做『騎虎難下』。</p>
<p>在守着這般廣大的地區而無法進取的時候，在財政羅掘已窮的時候，祇有開　子，販毒物，讓遠征的兵士做些工作，而榨取一點錢，這名之曰「繁榮」的「政策」，也是最後的「下策」了。可是一片焦士，滿眼瓦礫，既無從「繁榮」，也無財帛可榨，由「滑稽之流」招呼中國的老百姓「來啊，來啊」吧！却不幸來了一隊游擊隊，而居住着的老百姓也忽然全變做「　民」，「麻醉民心」和「就地微餉」的如意算盤，正如自扳石頭自壓腳。這呌做「啼笑皆非」。</p>
<p>而現在又更進一步，不但財政羅掘已窮，連軍隊都將不夠分配，方法却還多得想的，組織「反共靑年團」，「強黴一百三十五萬人」，這果然又是「以華制華」的毒辣政策；然而在游擊區中的中國青年是否隨便打發，他們自已也恐懼着「是否放心此等武裝華人，猶屬疑問」，——這是「左右爲難」了。</p>
<p>總之，近衛既不能保「衛」社　」，平沼麒一郎恐也不能「平」此大難，即使高唱「長期戰爭』，也將如喝了蒙汁酒似的，行將見「倒也，倒也」了！李輝英</p>
<h3>行軍瑣記</h3>
<p>— 李煇英</p>
<p>望着那新式的樓頂，有人在奇怪地叫起來。</p>
<p>「這小山溝，怎麼還會有樓房？」</p>
<p>「是呀，把樓房修在這里作什麼用？難道是關人的別墅不成？』</p>
<p>「是禮拜堂吧？外國人傳教的勢力是一直深人農村的。』</p>
<p>漸漸地拐過了山開。讓我們看見了全個樓面，那是一座粉自的二層樓，房頂還是倒翻過來的斗形洋頂，紅洋瓦蓋，非常耀眼。因爲樓的長度足有八九間以上。看起來寬敝壯觀。樓上窗于是方格子的，因之那廊子就橫陳在前面，寬寬　闔，顯得樓面很夠氣派</p>
<p>我們的猜想，無從得到合適的解答，因爲，倘如說這是孔朋，萬不會造出洋樓；教堂的樓房更不是這種樣子，闊人在這里條別蠶，交通又太不便利，那麼，除此之外，還能猜到什麼地方？</p>
<p>人是好奇的動物，這話該不錯吧？就以我們一行人來請，當第一眼望見樓頂矗立在這小小的山村時，就有些孩子一般覺得稀奇了；在僻塞的鄉村，忽然看見一座樓房，那比下鄉買　還難得。現在，隊伍既經走進小小的市街，爲了要證實自己的好奇心起見，放下肩上的背包和乾糧帶，就急急忙忙趕過去。</p>
<p>『那是孔子講明。』</p>
<p>街上的人指示着我們。在小小的山村中，能夠有機會在洋樓的孔廟中拜見一下至聖先師，這不是很難得麼。</p>
<p>剛走到街後，道旁的石碑留住我們的腳步。　『子路問路處。』——字跡風蝕雨淋得不淸楚了。</p>
<p>於是，我這武人，想起來昔日文聖的一段故事，不是麼，孔子迷了路，不知東南四北，派子路去問路，這才有了辦法。這——全是從前的事情了。</p>
<p>那粉白的洋樓，還有着八成新，看來沒有修理多久，門洞上刻着「問津書院」四個大宇，用在這裏的『問津』恐怕是說給現時的後學弟子的了，因爲這帝邊還掛着一面小學校的木牌。樓外高高的石灰牆上，殘存着「保八團」從前所寫的「勦共」的標語。</p>
<p>這樓房並非孔廟，正是個小學校，樓上地板的油漆還很光亮，佔用了這是一座樓房的小學校，規模不算小，可是現在空無一人，學校大概是因時局原故停課了。鄒嘯</p>
<h3>胡少保平×戰功</h3>
<p>— 鄒噓</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>明季周淸原的「西湖二集」最後一卷卽卷之三十四，就是「胡少保平倭戰功」並附「要緊海防」的方法於後，大約有深意存在裏面吧？否則爲什要把半倭的故事作爲壓卷，並且再三的把防倭的方法告訴讀者呢？</p>
<p>這一回短篇小說大部分是根據明茅坤的「紀剿除徐海本末」，好些地方只是文言改爲白話，並稍加描寫罷了。</p>
<p>其中有一節王翠翹的故事，寫妓女誘徐海投降，害死徐海，頗爲動人；其行爲有類於明末的費宮人。崑曲「刺虎」既是舞臺上常演的名劇，王翠翹該也是極好的戲劇題材了。</p>
<p>關於王翠翹，明佚各的『嘉靖東南平倭通錄』簡直不曾提起，明朱九德的「倭變事略」也只有這樣幾句：『嘉靖三十五年八月十九日，海知危在且攻夕，漏二鼓，遺親密護送二愛姬出巢逃遞」。所謂二愛姬，就是王翠翹和綠妹。</p>
<p>主翠翹的本事如下：『王翠翹臨溜妓也，倭寇江南，掠翠翹去，寨主徐海絕愛幸之，尊爲夫人。凡一切計劃惟翹指使，乃翹亦陽暱之，實陰幸其敗事。會督府遣華老人招海降，海將殺之，翹解其縛而贈之金。歸告督府，乃更遣羅中軍詣海說，而益市金珠寶玉以陰賄翹。翹日在帳中從容言大事必不可成，不如降也。海計遂决。督府大整兵，佯稱逆降；迫海寨，海信翹言不爲備，官兵突入，斬海首，而生致翹，倭人殲為。督府以翹賜永順酋長，翹去，渡錢塘　日：『明山遇我學，我以國事誘殺之；殺一酋更屬一酋，何面目生乎？」夜半投江死。」（節茅坤紀剿除徐海本末）</p>
<p>歐陽予倩想將此事衝爲新皮黃，以他寫一梁紅玉』的技巧，來寫王翠翹離間葉麻陳東，必有一番雋言妙語：惟本事中「市金珠寶玉以陰賄翹，」（稽　靑一中日歷代戰史」面三二六也說：「數還諜持簪珥　翠遺海兩侍女，日夜說海。）未免降低了王翠翹的身分和志願。照上下文看來，則主翠翹前既「陽諾之，實陰幸其敗事。」後又自言「以國事誘殺之。」可見在未受賄前，其志早决，並且明言是爲了國事，豈是金珠寶玉所能說動的呢？我希望將來予倩寫此劇時，能夠強調王翠翹爲國事殺徐海這一點。</p>
<p>徐海本是華人，助紂爲虐，這使我們想起八二二滬戰時，我國石洞口的漁夫，領導敵人深入，以致失去了羅店，蘇南亦因漁夫做了漢奸，以致蘇州無錫江險一帶，很快的失去，以今證古，如出一轍，予倩在「梁紅玉」既已活畫出王智來，那末像徐海那樣的大漢奸，一定也能夠給我們一張『謔畫』吧。</p>
<h3>讀「挑戰狀」後記</h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>在去年十二月某報紙上，似乎讀到一段新聞，說×人在華南的軍部司令官曾致蔣委員長以挑戰書，可惜新聞是讀過了，但×人的挑職書內容，却沒有這種眼福寓目。因想×人是善操筆作文的，並且還能標新立奇，舉凡人間不堪做的醜事，×人都能黨而正之的用正式的文件發出來。昨天買來一本最近一期的「文献」，裏面恰好轉刊着這而「鴻文」，一九三八年的世界文獻，得此一篇，足能生色不少罷。</p>
<p>『挑戰狀』三個字，無論怎樣仔細審查，總不類中國貨，大概又是和國產了，這三個字從前也沒有聽見過，且擇狀裏的幾句和文名句罷：</p>
<p>「夫天之這，炳煜如大日輸，風雲何懼　？蔣××秘暴毒天下，陷無辜之民衆於　炭之苦……」這是挑戰狀大文開頭，到底島國之民，一出口，就氣勢凌人。同時還品口聲聲『民衆』長，『民衆』短，說來×人入寇，侵略人家國土主權，恐怕又是×人有理，我們却沒有，並且還「替夭行道』，「解員之困」，說起來又是仁師了。記起『九一八』瀋陽事變那天的淸晨，瀋陽市街各處也曾大貼安民佈告，其氣派，造語，幾乎和這挑戰狀實無多大的差別，關東軍的強盜行爲，也是『蘇解民困』，強凌暴寡，×人卻自稱是替民衆趕出『萬惡軍閥』，眞是日本人的玩弄詞句，隨便造謠的技能，世界人土恐都當退避三舍了，現在再抄一段「九一八」事變第二天本莊繁的安民佈告：</p>
<p>「……夫我軍欲　　者，彼東北軍權而巳，關于所有民生休戚，本職最所注意苦慮，特對部下，巳經切實論示雜護其福利，愛護其身命，仰　東北民衆，各宜自重，無所憂……」</p>
<p>這段是日本在一九三一年的巨製，當然也是不可輕棄的重要文獻，和去年華南司令官所發的挑戰狀詞對校起來　，還是無大差別。『膚懲』『民衆」這一類的話說多了，也倒成爲平庸無奇，不過在挑戰狀裏還有奇句，不得不提引出來。就如：</p>
<p>「廣州之陷落，日軍僅以一，二個大隊作戰於是役，眞不堪脾肉之嘆……時正嶺南沃野秋色深，驅颯爽之風，進軍以决勝負……』</p>
<p>島國小民勝則喜，躊踷滿志的醜態，溢於言表，大有像村里小兒，拾得狗頭金，得了便宜還賣乖。</p>
<p>但最表出痛苦萬狀的，並不在這些高視傲然的吹牛大話裏，乃是尾段的：</p>
<p>「稱畏期抗戰而僅示以背，徒招卑劣　怯之謗耳」。</p>
<p>這幾句，其實長期抗戰的策略，就是『不迎面出擊』，「而僅示以背」的戰法，昨日（二十三）×酋板　陸相在議會中發表的演說中，對中國現有的軍隊配置曾有估計，大的還有一百十師軍隊，絲亳禾受損害而戰鬥極強的中國軍隊，那麼×酋也就不得不以「此次中日戰爭。不僅海陸軍人努力，且須全國人民共負艱　」的忠言，向全島國人民作最最迫切的要求了。狄酋板垣是曾在台兒莊吃過大苦頭，眞知道中國利害的一員　軍高級畏官，那麼他的話，能引起全島人的言視了。如果拿了板垣的話來。和道挑戰狀裏的「徒招卑劣卑怯之　」的話相對證，那麼最醜陋卑劣卑怯不是中國，正是日本了。</p>
<p>去年十月時候，日本軍隊在德安一役，喪師萬人，血戰七畫夜如果對「脾肉之嘆」而言，眞是厭其　　，大過戰爭　了，然而×軍司令卻投出祈降書，要求刀下留情，槍下留命，下賤可憐之醜態，比之於挑戰狀，眞不堪以道里計了了。</p>
<p>常聞人言，日本人是世界上最會　　的民族，其實也是世上最不知恥的民族。咸過「挑戰狀」，就更不會有昌　了。</p>

        <h1>1939.01.29</h1>
<h3>The Responsibility of the National Gentry</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolai</p>
<p>From "August 13th" until now, our country has been engaged in a life-or-death struggle with the × people, it's either us or them. The life of the nation is now hanging by a thread, and every citizen should rise up and bravely face the difficulty! Now, our divinely gifted and valiant leader is bending over backwards and exhausting himself in dealing with the ×, how should we, as members of the nation, ponder deeply, sharpen our resolve, and exert ourselves to serve the country's needs? Perhaps the blood shed by soldiers and civilians for the war of resistance will not have been shed in vain, and the nation will be able to find a glimmer of hope amidst the myriad difficulties.</p>
<p>However, our supreme leader is handling a myriad of affairs every day and has no time to spare, making it difficult for him to personally connect with the people in various regions one by one. Therefore, it is essential that outstanding local talents emerge to advocate and expand the scope of their service to their hometowns, and to fulfill their responsibility to defend the nation. I previously read the leader's telegram to the national gentry, which repeatedly emphasized this point with earnestness, and I admire it immensely. The telegram particularly focuses on "promoting military service" and "developing the local economy." Please elaborate on these two matters:</p>
<p>(1) Today, since the war has become a national war of resistance, everyone should take up arms to defend the country. The local gentry and their children, who are usually accustomed to a life of comfort and luxury, can now set an example and be pioneers for the people. The masses will naturally follow suit, which is more effective than government decrees, I dare say. I, though not talented, participated in the citizen training in Shanghai before the "August 13th" battle, regardless of my age. Not only did my physique get trained and become stronger, but I also felt particularly happy spiritually. Furthermore, I sent my children to military school several years ago, hoping that they would be able to serve the country on the battlefield after they finish their studies. There are countless national gentry who deeply understand the greater good, and if they can demonstrate it with actions and respond to our leader's call, I am confident that it can become a trend in the shortest possible time. Then, the government can seize the opportunity and guide it, achieving twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(2) Our leader also declared to the people: "With the abundance of our country's products and the strength of our manpower, if we can organize meticulously and utilize them flexibly, then the sustained economic strength alone will be enough to deal a fatal blow to the × people." This is why he encourages our gentry to actively assist the government in developing the local economy to replenish resources for a long-term war of resistance and lay the foundation for future nation-building. I feel that although the capital of our ethnic minorities has been unable to develop normally due to the economic oppression of a powerful neighbor, and North and Southeast China have been destroyed by the Japanese military and economic invasion, fortunately, the products and manpower of our Southwest and Northwest are no less than those of North and Southeast China. Moreover, the country's need to develop wartime resources is extremely urgent. We should seize this opportunity, follow the leader's telegram and government decrees, and vigorously correct the past mistake of focusing solely on urban construction, and actively develop the inland according to a certain plan and organization. However, we must pay attention to the fact that economic construction must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood and should not only be for the benefit of a few, but should aim to realize "everyone has work to do, and everyone has food to eat." This not only addresses the current problems, but also reduces countless bloodshed and friction in the construction of a new China and the transformation of a new society in the future. Our gentry should pay close attention to this.</p>
<p>I often think to myself: The greatest power in the world cannot be estimated by numbers. The Japanese aggressors have always been known for their love of grand achievements, but after these nineteen months of war, their financial and military strength has been stretched thin, and their state of poverty and distress can be evidenced by numbers. Their inevitable disastrous defeat and collapse is a matter of course. On the contrary, our country's greatness cannot be measured by numbers. I have recently traveled to various provinces in the Southwest and am even more convinced that our country's greatness cannot be measured by numbers, and the greatness of the Northwest provinces is no less than that of the Southwest provinces. However, this vast virgin land cannot be developed in a day or two, or by the efforts of one person alone. Our gentry should widely publicize this to all sectors at home and abroad, so that they know that our country not only has the strength to persist in the war of resistance, but also has the conditions to win the war. The day of final victory will not be far away. As I write this, I cannot help but feel infinite excitement and anticipation, hoping that everyone will strive to embody the "four diligences" proclaimed in the leader's telegram and reject the "four wastes" that he warned against. May all compatriots, especially the gentry, encourage each other.</p>
<h3>The Rebirth of the Chinese Nation (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chiang Soong Mei-ling</p>
<p>In the previous article (see the second edition of the 19th), I explained that we have a firm belief in the rebirth of the Chinese nation. However, to turn belief into reality, we must evolve from ideal reasoning into practical action.</p>
<p>The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates trained his disciples to 'understand themselves.' Undoubtedly, he wanted everyone to do an objective, calm self-analysis as the basis for improving themselves.</p>
<p>To build a novel, strong, and unified Republic of China, each of us must first engage in deep introspection. We must strictly examine and frankly admit our past failures and mistakes, so that we can remedy failures and correct mistakes in the days to come.</p>
<p>The bad results we reap are the seeds we ourselves have sown. In the past few years, our lax atmosphere has developed into a stagnant custom that is not universal. If our country has become a laggard in the international arena, then we can only blame ourselves and cannot complain about others.</p>
<p>If a new China with a glorious life can emerge from blue blood and ashes in the future, then those in responsible positions will realize that they must automatically shoulder the burden and devote their greatest obligations, all their energy, thoughts, and wisdom to the work of benefiting the country and the people. Otherwise, he should resign and take the blame.</p>
<p>To clean up the post-war mess and rebuild China, character is extremely important. We need the integrity of the mind, the purity of behavior, and most importantly, a clear conscience. Of course, we also need practical wisdom.</p>
<p>Personal behavior is the model for continuing a good personality. Therefore, as long as we improve our lives and revive our sense of responsibility for public and private matters, we can personally establish lofty morals, thereby generating a force that can make an effective contribution to the regeneration of the entire nation. If we cannot carve out our own path to self-salvation, then we will disgrace our ancestors.</p>
<p>All those in responsible positions, even if they only have one point of ability, must do their best with that ability. This is not only for the country, but also for personal consideration, in order to avoid the ugly name of being a sinecure and to avoid the accusation of deliberately shirking responsibility in the face of national crisis.</p>
<p>We should strictly criticize all actions that violate the interests of the public, and we must conduct a review without favoritism of those who superficially pretend to be enthusiastic about public affairs but live off the state. On the other hand, those who are supported by the national treasury, registered as officials, but abandon their responsibilities and bear guilt will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Giving commendation and rewards to those who are responsible and wise is the least amount of compensation.</p>
<p>All of our compatriots have a responsibility to cleanse and wash away the flaws of corruption and bribery that our country once had. Closely following corruption is the shadow of cowardice. We should always remember that our national humiliation and the shame of our territory being ceded after the Sino-Japanese War were the result of the combination of corruption and cowardice. Now, we have the opportunity to wash away this historical stain. The heroic soldiers on the front lines are sacrificing their lives, which is enough to make us no longer worry about our own safety. Only the traitors who have lost their conscience, who take advantage of safety to directly or indirectly embezzle public funds for saving the country and resisting the war, and disappoint the heroic soldiers, will not be ashamed. Everyone in the rear should pay attention without hiding that all the strength and all the money are completely used for the work of resisting the war and building the country. This work is causing many soldiers to sacrifice and countless people to suffer. Not only because our country's fate is in a more dangerous situation than it was in the Sino-Japanese War, but also because we want to leave a reputation of integrity and courage in the historical record.</p>
<p>Our past flaws were described long ago by Edmund Burke in his writings. He said: 'Food and filth give us more harm than hundreds of millions of debts; it expels the courage of our soldiers, deprives the wisdom of our authorities, and the credit of the most important parts of our political machinery.' Who would want to relive this old lesson of pain? Everyone will of course say "no." Then, is there anything more urgent and important than that every official should tremble and always regard the reward he receives, the salary he receives from the national treasury, that is, the blood and sweat directly and indirectly contributed by the people, as something that cannot be taken lightly!</p>
<p>No one who receives a salary from the state can forget, nor can they be allowed to forget, that since he enjoys the people's taxes, he is the people's servant. We must use the two concepts of improving purity and truly serving the people as the criterion for all actions.</p>
<p>The corrupt idea that officials are the masters of the people should be driven out of our minds as far as possible.</p>
<p>From the flames of freedom, we will forge a new understanding: all people who pay taxes have the right to enjoy the grace of a good and just government, and this government must truly work for the benefit of the people at any cost.</p>
<p>If the government can do this, the people will inevitably be rich, and if the people are rich, the country will inevitably be prosperous. A prosperous country must be peaceful and strong.</p>
<p>When the country reaches a state of peace and prosperity, then a new China will be like the legendary phoenix, resurrected from her ashes, truly achieving the purpose predicted by the Latin word (RESURGAN): "I will be reborn."</p>
<h3>China in Battle (II)</h3>
<p>— Written by Karlman of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>—Translated from the January 1st Moscow News—</p>
<p>The Soldiers of the New China</p>
<p>In the morning, I met Mr. Zhou Enlai at General Chen Cheng's headquarters. He was very thin and looked very tired, looking around at the people with his red eyes due to lack of sleep. He was ordered by President Chiang to preside over the investigation into the truth of the Changsha fire.</p>
<p>Chen Yiji (transliteration), the commander of the Yuezhou army, personally told me about the battle situation along the railway. He was already thirty-one years old, but he looked no more than twenty-five. He was very lively and optimistic. He paced back and forth in the room. His laughter was very clear, and he gestured enthusiastically when he spoke. He is known as the "General Who Never Retreats" in the country and in the army. When the Sino-Japanese War began, the superior × army attacked the regiment he commanded in Hebei. This area was in the western wing of the Chinese army, and its mission was to defend Baoding. The Japanese army attacked Baoding in three routes to eliminate this regiment. At that time, the Chinese artillery had not yet arrived from the rear, while the × air force and heavy artillery had already been fully deployed. Chen Yiji and his soldiers held out against the × people for four days and nights under constant shelling and bombing. On the fourth day, only a few dozen soldiers were left. He personally led them in close combat. Unfortunately, he was hit by a bullet in the shoulder and fell down. The news spread to the ears of every soldier in an instant. After "The regimental commander is injured!" someone shouted, "The regimental commander is dead!" The advancing ranks stopped unexpectedly. He woke up, stood up straight, and shouted: "The regimental commander is here, charge!"</p>
<p>In the panic, the Japanese army quickly left the highlands, losing countless rifles and machine guns. The soldiers occupied the highlands and guarded them for six more hours according to the received orders. But the second bullet pierced through the chest of Regimental Commander Chen again. Several lightly injured soldiers carried him to the rear. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 2,000 casualties.</p>
<p>Chen Yiji left the hospital and returned to the team before the end of his recuperation period. In Taierzhuang, he led a brigade to participate in the annihilation of the Japanese × war. In Xuzhou, his brigade intercepted the Japanese army that wanted to encircle the Chinese army. He was ordered to cover the large army until it was out of the encirclement. The Japanese army used planes to bomb his brigade and released poison gas. After most of his subordinates died guarding the position due to poisoning, he helped a few personal followers to personally go to the Chen site to fight.</p>
<p>The Chinese army finally left the country, but he still led some soldiers to continue to support and inflict heavy blows on the Japanese. The bold statement "It is easier to shake a mountain than to shake the Chinese army" resonated throughout the country.</p>
<p>Brigade Commander Chen said: "The Japanese are finished, we have stopped them. Many times they wanted to forcefully cross the river to enter Changsha, but every attack was repelled. On the other side of the river, they are building strong fortifications; laying barbed wire; repairing the railways that we automatically destroyed into highways; and sending spies to our side every day. Often, they just grab a villager and give him an injection in his hand, and send him to the front line. They tell him that the poison is fatal, and say: If you bring back news of the Chinese army within ten days, we will give you another antidote injection, and you can live. Those villagers went all the way to the Chinese army headquarters to tell this situation. Yesterday, two such muddleheads gave up their lives and died very miserably. The villagers talked about the various terrorist methods of the Japanese army in the occupied areas. Because the Japanese could not find food or places to live in those places, nor could they find roads, they retaliated on the residents who had not had time to avoid them. They killed hundreds and thousands of people, first subjecting them to all kinds of abuses. This requires people to... to..."</p>
<p>Brigade Commander Chen broke the... and someone helped a fashionable woman in, and the woman was crying. She was the wife of one of the masterminds of the Changsha fire who was executed this time. The sound of crying still came from outside the window in waves. Three gunshots came from behind the tree. Brigade Commander Chen listened attentively and closed the window and said: "This is them being shot." (Continued on page 3)</p>

<h3>The Northwestern War is Approaching. A Certain Official Inspects the Front Lines. Our Strength is Several Times Greater Than the × Army. There Have Been Skirmishes in Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 28th of this month] Shaanxi Electric Dispatch: Because the × have repeatedly increased their troops in Shanxi and Suiyuan, we have also strengthened our defenses in the Northwest. Now our strength is several times greater than that of the ×, and our weapons are also quite sophisticated. It is impossible for the × to break through. A certain official recently went to the front again for inspection, greatly boosting morale. It is confirmed that the × have suffered a total of 10,000 casualties in their harassment of western Shanxi. Recently, they have been constantly mobilizing on the Tongpu Road and various highways, and fierce battles will resume. Currently, there are small contacts in the vicinity of Yuxiang, Jiexian, Anyi, Xiaxian, Wenxi, Jiangxian, and Quwo. Our guerrillas once occupied the Songdian Station. The capture of Xiaxian has not been confirmed. Between Zhongyang and Lishi, we annihilated more than 100 × soldiers and are still in fierce battle.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 28th of this month] The military situation in the Northwest is gradually becoming tight.

Kondo's Fifth Fleet has also gathered towards Weizhou Island, attempting to invade from Beihai. We have made strict preparations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] Nearly 1,000 × have recently been added to Fenyang. The commander resides in Diaoshi, commanding the troops in Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Zhongyang, and Lishi. There is no change in the Jiugu Hujia Rong area.

They also said that they suffered from hunger and cold in the mountains and gained nothing. The Chinese army's hand grenades are very lethal, it was said. In addition, a guerrilla team of our department in central Shanxi attacked the × in Pingyao and Jiexiu for several days in a row, achieving considerable gains, and destroyed more than four miles of the railway between Beiliang Rubiqiao and Jichengdian, and destroyed a turret.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] Military News: The × have added a total of eight or nine thousand troops in Anyi, Yuncheng, Jiexian, and Jiangxian in southern Shanxi.

<p>[People's Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 28th] The ×, who had invaded Yangyi in the south, sneaked into the Niuchuan Nanyang Yang area on the 22nd, with a vanguard of more than 1,000 troops, and advanced towards Heshun. They were intercepted by our troops near Qianjiaying and fought fiercely for more than five hours, killing more than 200 × soldiers. By evening, the × successively reinforced and bombarded our positions with heavy artillery. Our army then moved its position for battle reasons. That night, the × advanced to Heshun City and Yaboping (east of Heshun) and still showed signs of advancing south.</p>
<p>[People's Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 28th] More than 1,000 × have been added to Lingshi in recent days, with seven or eight artillery pieces, stationed in the Shagu Shangcun area east of the city, plotting to commit Jingzhen Le.

<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] It is rumored that the Japanese government has decided to annex the Xisha Islands. The Japanese decision has been approved by the Japanese Emperor on the 28th of this month. London is consulting on this matter, which has not yet been confirmed. Diplomatic officials believe that it is not very reliable. According to what is known, France occupies the island, which is undoubtedly the case. There are only a few fishermen on the island. It is reported that when Japan wanted to occupy Hainan Island some time ago, the French government decided to take steps to guarantee its rights to the Xisha Islands. France sent a warship to the area and saw a Japanese warship docked there. After exchanging courtesies, the Japanese warship withdrew within a few hours.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 27th] After all the Gui Sui × bandits moved to Xincheng, several members of our plainclothes team sneaked into the city and burned many houses where the × were stationed, causing heavy losses to the ×.

<h3>The Victory Report of Our Army in Hangzhou's Suburbs: Twice Attacking the × Army in Gongbu, Fierce Battles in Changan and Tangqi</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shanghai on the 28th of this month] Special News from Hangzhou: Liu's troops and Jiang Shuwei's troops of the Jiaxing Militia Volunteers in the suburbs of Hangzhou took advantage of their victory on the 20th and advanced from the Yu Hang Highway and other places. The Gongzhan Bridge was captured and continued to advance towards Hangzhou City. On the 21st, more than 1,000 soldiers from the × army suddenly came from Shanghai, covered by artillery and aircraft, and pounced on the Gongbu position. In order to avoid sacrifices, we temporarily retreated to ××. On the 21st, we took the opportunity to rush into Gongbu again, and then released the fruit. The area has been extremely chaotic in recent days. In addition to rushing to build fortifications in the city, the × army has also transferred a large number of reinforcements from the Beijing-Hangzhou National Road and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, stationed in Jibomen, Qiantangmen, Yongjinmen, and other places. Since the 23rd, the × army in Tangqi in the suburbs of Hangzhou has been attacked by our army from Huzhou in four routes. The × army's defense works have been completely destroyed, and a barracks of × soldiers has been burned down. Fierce battles are still going on. Water and land transportation are completely cut off.

<h3>Chongqing Churches Telegraph the League of Nations to Expose the Crimes of Japanese ×, The Residences of Foreign Nationals in Xi'an Were Also Destroyed by × Aircraft</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] The churches in Chongqing telegraphed the League of Nations to protest that the × aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of urban areas in Chongqing on the 15th caused hundreds of innocent civilians to be killed or injured, which is a great crime against humanity, and requested the League of Nations to awaken world opinion and unanimously condemn the Japanese side's atrocities. The well-known organizations in the telegram are the American Methodist Mission in the Inland, the Anglican Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Canadian Church, and the Friends Church.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] When Japanese aircraft bombed Xi'an on the 28th of this month, the residence of Ms. Franklin, a female missionary of the Central Baptist Church, collapsed due to the shock.

<h3>Rumors that Shao Lizi Was Kidnapped Is Actually a Misunderstanding. This Newspaper Sent Special Telegrams to Chongqing and Shanghai to Investigate the Truth. The Kidnapped Person Was Wool Merchant Zhao Lianchi</h3>
<p>[Special News from This Newspaper] Yesterday morning, Reuters and Associated Press reported that Shao Lizi was kidnapped by × at his residence on Avenyi Road, Dahua Road, Shanghai. This newspaper sent special telegrams to Chongqing and Shanghai to investigate the truth. After receiving replies last night, it was confirmed that it was a misunderstanding. The Chongqing reply said, "Regarding the kidnapping of Shao Lizi in Shanghai, after inquiring from people close to Shao, it was confirmed to be completely untrue. Shao has not yet gone to Shanghai, let alone been kidnapped by ×. Chongqing finds this unfounded rumor ridiculous." The Shanghai reply said, "After careful investigation, Shao Lizi did not come to Shanghai. According to foreign telegrams, the kidnapped person was actually wool merchant Lu Huanchi. The Shanghai English Da Mei Evening News mistakenly identified him as Shao Lizi due to translation issues."</p>
<h3>× Maneuvers Exhausted: Forged Telegram from Wu Peifu Attempting to Force Wu to Assume a Puppet Position; Wu's Spokesperson Denies</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beijing, 28th] Japanese sources spread rumors that Wu Peifu has accepted a position under Japanese protection. Today, Wu's spokesperson angrily denied it, stating, "Wu sent a telegram to several of his friends, but Japanese inspectors recklessly altered it, turning it into a telegram to deceive the entire nation." Neutral observers explain that the Japanese are doing this to force Wu to betray his integrity.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beijing, 28th] According to reports from here, people in both the Northern and Southern puppet governments deeply fear that Wu Peifu will take up a puppet military position, thus losing their power. The news released by the Domei News Agency, requesting Wu to take a position, was entirely issued by the traitorous side. Neutral observers believe that the Japanese are spreading this news with the aim of having the traitor Liang issue a declaration, enraging Wu and making him accept Japanese conditions, thereby excluding the traitor Liang.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beijing, 28th] The puppet government continues to try to entice Wu Peifu to take a position. However, the various puppets within the puppet organization fear that once Wu takes office, he will seize their power. Therefore, they only nominally promote Wu to head North China military affairs. The Japanese still have their final chess move in mind, that is, if they cannot induce Wang Jingwei to take a puppet position in the Central China government, they will utilize Wu. Wu met with a group of traitors from the puppet provisional government on the 24th of this month, but the meeting ended unhappily. The traitors in the puppet government suggested to Wu that he should leave Beiping for Kaifeng to take up a military position, with Kaifeng as his base. Wu angrily said that this was not inviting him to take a position, but actually exiling him.</p>
<p>× Failure to Entice Wu Peifu; Now Attempting to Entice Wang Zhaoming</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 28th] According to political figures, the Japanese military is paying close attention to Wang Jingwei. They currently believe that Wang is still residing in Hanoi. Although Wang recently announced the so-called "Three No's Doctrine," the Japanese still hope that he can emerge to form a puppet regime under their control. At that time, Wang could obtain the title of "President." It is also rumored that Japanese agents are still urging Wang to take a position immediately and not stay in Hanoi for long. Furthermore, the plan advocated by the previous Konoe cabinet in Japan to merge puppet regimes or organize a joint Chinese puppet regime has been completely abandoned by the Hiranuma cabinet. Hiranuma and others believe that the merger of puppet organizations is of no importance, and the most important issue is how to make the Chinese people willing to accept Japanese rule. Therefore, they should utilize their past influence over Wang to preside over the South China puppet regime and assist Japan in ruling all of China.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members Assigned to Serve on the Battlefield and Preside Over Political Training Work</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 28th] According to political figures, members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees without fixed duties will be immediately dispatched to various guerrilla units to preside over political training work for the military and the people. (Editor's Note: This news was first recorded in this newspaper's special dispatch on the 26th.) According to recent reports received here, battles are occurring in various guerrilla areas, and as a result, Japan cannot but step up its response.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Guerrillas Execute Spies; Shanghai × Lacks Strength</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Office, 28th] In the Yanghang area of Baoshan County, our army's guerrillas have entered and are active, controlling land and water transportation in the surrounding villages. The county town's × army does not dare to underestimate and attack this force and remains motionless due to its limited strength. In order to actively carry out anti-traitor work, the guerrillas recently selected two individuals from among the several pseudo-investigators sent by Shanghai's pseudo-"Detective Weaving Team" who were loyal as slaves and acted as spies for the × side to investigate the guerrillas' movements. After interrogation, the two pseudo-"investigators" admitted to engaging in sabotage work against the guerrillas and have been executed in a certain location. Before long, the translator of the pseudo-"Police Station" was also arrested by the guerrillas the day before yesterday. The reason for the arrest was also for specializing in espionage work for the × army. After the two cases occurred, the × pseudo-authorities were greatly alarmed and have been stepping up precautions in the Songbao area in recent days.</p>
<h3>× Occupation; Reopening of the Yangtze River Indefinitely Postponed; German Ship Robbed Near Zhanghuabin</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 28th] According to the chairman of the Wuhan Pseudo-Maintenance of Public Order Committee, the Japanese side is determined to reopen Yangtze River navigation within a month. However, business circles in that area do not believe this news. It is heard that British merchants in Hankou have requested the British authorities to send ships to transport British expatriate families from Shanghai back to Hankou. However, the British ambassador advised British expatriates not to board Japanese ships on the Yangtze River to avoid affecting the issue of demanding the reopening of waterways from Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Shanghai dispatch: The German ship "Hensha" was robbed by pirates near Zhanghuabin at the mouth of the Yangtze River yesterday at midnight. Several Chinese passengers and a barge loaded with goods were taken away. The pirates have not yet made a ransom demand.</p>

<h3>China at War Continued from Page 2</h3>
<p>Hengshan Military Conference</p>
<p>Traveling from Changsha to Hengshan must be done at night. The journey is one hundred and twenty kilometers. Crossing the river is the most dangerous, because dozens of cars always line up waiting for the ferry, making it a conspicuous target. Hengshan has recently been bombed flat by × planes. Even the magnificent ancient temple on the outskirts of Hengshan was not spared. Dozens of people fled into the temple during the air raid, and many of them died under the ruins.</p>
<p>A spacious old school has now become a dense, impassable forest. Dozens of cypress and pine trees cut from the mountains are planted in the ground, and the entire courtyard is covered with a thick layer of pine and cypress branches. Commanders from all war fronts gathered here to exchange experiences, compile statistics on the completed first phase of the war of resistance, and plan the path for future resistance. This is the essence of the Chinese army, with commanders of all armies, divisions, and brigades gathered in one place.</p>
<p>The meeting started at dawn and stopped when the planes could operate, continuing again in the evening.</p>
<p>Before the meeting started, the representatives walked around in groups in the courtyard, discussing or sitting on the surrounding rocks waiting for the meeting to begin. The large number of young people was most noticeable. Many young officers were promoted to important positions within a few months of the war because of their courage and resourcefulness. If a famous senior general passed by in the courtyard, they would stand at attention and salute. Among the representatives, General Chen Cheng, the commander of the Ninth War Zone and the Minister of the Political Department, was of a slender build and not very tall. He had just arrived from Changsha with Chairman Chiang. General Bai Chongxi, tall, handsome, and refined, was also Chairman Chiang's closest comrade in the war of resistance. The training of new recruits that he was responsible for was the most important task in the war of resistance. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin hurried past the rows of people, walking into the meeting hall. The hall was full, and everyone sat down in order, but after a shout of "Attention," everyone stood up straight. Chairman Chiang strode in and sat on the high platform decorated with flags, indicating for the officers to sit down. After each speaker saluted the Chairman, they began to speak. Each commander spoke in turn about the × people's strengths and vulnerable points. The × people were afraid of bad weather and darkness and could not fight in the mountains or in places far from transportation lines. In short, they could not withstand the loss of even one condition for battle: if the Japanese army did not have artillery support, they would completely lose their fighting ability. They often concentrated their forces on one point, losing contact with the rear, and thus suffered losses from the guerrillas.</p>
<p>All speakers at the meeting unanimously praised the Chinese soldiers' courage and perseverance when discussing their strengths. They hated the × people and were not afraid of death. They fought very well in the mountains without artillery support and often launched two-pronged attacks, which the Japanese invariably could not resist.</p>
<p>The commanders also noted their own shortcomings. They all said that they must accelerate communication in the war zone, strengthen communication between various units, and improve the treatment of wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>When there was an air raid alert, the officers would leave their seats and take refuge in the mountain caves, listening to the rattling sound of the × planes. Once, fifteen bombers flew overhead, unaware of the rich target below them, unaware that in these caves, the best military commanders in China were discussing plans to destroy the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said at this historically significant meeting:</p>
<p>"The first phase of the war of resistance has ended, and we have entered a new stage of the war of resistance. In order to plan how to strengthen our forces in the future war of resistance, our officers and soldiers must analyze the lessons and experiences of the first phase of the war of resistance. We lured the Japanese army deep into our country, dispersed their forces everywhere, and shattered their dream of a quick victory. Therefore, we were victorious in this phase. The Japanese plot to conquer China has become a bubble."</p>
<p>Dozens of camouflaged cars flashed their lights and made a humming sound in the mountains in the middle of the night. The commanders bid farewell in a hurry and went to the front lines.</p>
<p>The Changsha government's bulletin board was filled with the steps taken to relieve the victims of the Changsha fire and the news of the severe punishment of those responsible. So now the road is again crowded with groups of refugees returning to the city.</p>
<p>Reserve Army Headquarters</p>
<p>After crossing the river in the middle of the night, we entered Guangxi Province. Young male and female sentries carefully checked all vehicles crossing the border and inspected documents.</p>
<p>Guangxi Province in southwestern China occupies a special position in the country. Its administration, geography, living conditions, residents' work habits, and even clothing are very unique. So once you enter Guangxi Province, you feel like you have crossed a border. Even the mountains here do not look like mountains: tall, straight obelisks rise from the flat plateau. They appear one after another in the thousands on the azure, misty horizon. This peculiar and magnificent landscape is very similar to the polychrome stone columns in a mysterious ancient Greek building that an artist is trying to express. The people of Guangxi say that according to scientific research, Guangxi Province was actually the bottom of the ocean, and these stone pillars were formed by the currents in the water. There are many caves in the mountains, several kilometers long, with dazzling scenery inside, magnificent underground palaces, magnificent arched main halls, steep cliffs, and cascading waterfalls, truly a wondrous sight. The scenery created by nature here is a virtual dream that architectural genius cannot realize.</p>
<p>The people of Guangxi use these caves to avoid air raids. Guilin, the provincial capital of Guangxi, is bombed violently by the × people almost every day. They have completely destroyed street after street. Thousands of people have become homeless, and it is all thanks to the timely issuance of each air raid alert that the loss of life in the city is relatively small.</p>
<p>As soon as each alarm is issued, the entire city is immediately vacated. Tens of thousands of people surge through the streets like a tide. Store owners and residents hurriedly board up their doors, and after a quarter of an hour, the entire city is like death. The crowds have already left the city and are heading into the mountains. Looking down on the entire city from the mountain peaks is like holding it in your palm. The sound of airplanes is getting closer. Eighteen twin-engine bombers, with fighter escorts, are flying at high altitude. After a while, there should be the sound of explosions, but unexpectedly, the planes do not drop bombs and just pass over our heads like this. After a while, the mountains and the city are filled with leaflets falling from the sky, with absurd words written on them.</p>
<p>The people hiding in the mountains are extremely angry. They tear up the leaflets before they finish reading them and pile them up on the spot to burn. Those eighteen planes turn around and fly over the city again, and dozens of heavy bombs fall into the city. The mountains shake as if they have been shaken. The planes, in order to avoid the bombardment of anti-aircraft guns, disperse individually and bomb the urban area back and forth. People watch their houses collapse with stunned eyes, and many people even cry.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that the Japanese dropped leaflets on the residents of Guangxi Province, and it is no coincidence that the people of Guangxi put down their guns.</p>
<p>Guangxi Province is the headquarters of China's people's reserve army. Of the province's population of fourteen million, two and a half million can fight and have received military training. Villagers in every village receive two hours of military training after work. Those receiving military training include university students, middle school students, government agency service personnel, and women. Five hundred thousand soldiers in the Chinese army are from Guangxi. Every high school graduate in Guangxi is qualified to be a squad leader.</p>
<p>The literacy rate is very high in this relatively poor province. Sixty-four percent of Guangxi residents have received education. Every Guangxi person is very proud of the province's fighting ability and talks about the glorious responsibilities that Guangxi people have in the war of self-defense. Guangxi people are strong, healthy, able to endure hardship and stand hard work. The women here have never bound their feet and carry burdens like men, which is rarely seen in Hunan and Hubei. When you see the flying beauty of Guangxi women, you cannot help but admire them. A pair of large, intelligent eyes sparkle in their ivory-colored faces. They use their strong, muscular hands to row heavy oars on boats, carrying heavy buckets of burdens, and still walk so briskly. Guangxi women are also excellent at shooting. They can endure all the hardships of marching like men. All the way to the border of Guizhou Province, we kept seeing teams of young male and female student soldiers fully armed receiving training in strategy, shooting, construction, and marching.</p>
<p>The Curse of Compromise</p>
<p>We gradually turned into the mountains, sometimes with a layer of milky white clouds hovering beneath our feet. The road was built a few years ago, and there is a monument on the rocks beside the road commemorating the workers who died while building this road due to heatstroke, illness, and falling. These mountains contain infinite treasures. Coal seams are on the surface, almost everywhere. One day, the fires of smelting furnaces will be lit here, and trains loaded with coal and metals will come and go in the mountain caves. The sound of waterfalls will come from the power plant's boilers. Today, only a small amount of coal is extracted from these millions of tons of rich reserves, only to warm a poor man's thatched hut.</p>
<p>After crossing another border, we left Guizhou. From the gray, high, cloud-covered rocks, we descended into the fertile Sichuan valley. The orchards and endless rice fields on both sides of the Yangtze River are all covered by a layer of gray mist. We have already traveled one thousand five hundred kilometers since leaving Changsha. The road descends very steeply towards the Yangtze River. The turns protrude over the river. Spreading above the mountains is a large city, covered by low gray clouds, that is Chongqing!—China's temporary capital.</p>
<p>Even before the fall of Hankou, Chongqing had in fact become an important center of China. All political organizations, central agencies, and famous artists, writers, and scientists from Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai, as long as they were not directly participating in frontline work, were concentrated in Chongqing.</p>
<p>You can tell at a glance that Chongqing is densely populated. The roads are crowded with cars, rickshaws, and thousands of people. The people on the streets are very active and excited. It is currently propaganda week, and at every street corner, groups of people are gathered around propagandists listening to their reports on war news and the popular voices from all over the country responding urgently to the government's military arrangements. This war has promoted the consolidation of the Chinese people at an unprecedented speed. They believe in their inevitable victory. The year 1939 coincided with the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. China is examining and measuring its strength, compiling statistics, and mobilizing China's trained army of 240 divisions.</p>
<p>Less than two months after the fall of Wuhan, all the army losses in the battle to defend Wuhan had been completely replenished, and hundreds of thousands of fresh troops were ready to join the ranks.</p>
<p>All army necessities are abundant. Last year's harvest was bountiful, and large amounts of food were able to be hoarded to supply soldiers and residents.</p>
<p>The Chinese people know that the × people are exhausted and that tens of millions of people in the occupied areas have risen up to fight.</p>
<p>The Chinese people curse all traitors who dream of "peace" and surrender.</p>
<p>"Resolutely resist to the end until the × people are completely destroyed." These two sentences, like raging flames, are burning in the hearts of the Chinese people, who are using all their strength to overthrow the × people.</p>
<h3>× Financial Situation on the Brink of Bankruptcy; Intending to Increase Taxes Again in Mid-February; Desperate for War Funds</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] According to official news agency reports, in order to cope with the specially increased military expenditure, the Ministry of Finance will implement an increase in income tax, transaction tax, and sugar monopoly tax in mid-January to raise 200,000 yen.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Japanese Minister of Finance proposed a case that stipulates that the government will purchase all gold in the country, and all privately held gold ornaments should also be presented to the government. The Japanese government's new establishment of this regulation and the application of new taxes show that the Japanese side is searching for ways to support the war expenses against China.</p>
<p>Japan Sends Tani Masayuki as Ambassador to France; French Authorities Reject</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tokyo News: Japan sent Tani Masayuki as ambassador to France and sought France's consent. The French authorities refused because Tani had publicly attacked France to reporters in Shanghai. Hiranuma and Arita were very embarrassed and convened a cabinet meeting on the 27th to discuss countermeasures. It was reportedly decided that Arita would handle the situation as circumstances required, temporarily dispatching its minister-counselor in France as acting envoy, and the Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that France's refusal to consent was incomprehensible. During the plenary session of the House of Peers, member Sakatani also raised questions about Tani's case, but Arita only said that he was currently watching France's attitude and had no intention of replacing the ambassador.</p>
<p>House of Representatives Foreign Policy Questions; × Cabinet Members Struggling to Cope</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tokyo News: The Japanese House of Representatives held a plenary session on the 27th, with the most questions about foreign policy. First, Tsurumi Yusuke of the Democratic Party, known for his foreign affairs expertise, raised questions about the notes from the UK, the US, and France. Tsurumi said that since the views of the three countries were different from Japan's, what methods would the cabinet use to make them understand? Arita replied that he would deal with it with an unyielding spirit, and that long-term endurance was needed not only in armed warfare but also in ideological and cultural warfare. Tsurumi also asked why the cabinet did not make further efforts since the US note of December 31 was milder than before. Arita replied that he would adopt specific policies after the end of the war to make them understand. This answer showed that Arita still had room for flexibility, with the intention being to be both willing and cautious. Kasai Heiji questioned whether there was a solution to the issue of Yangtze River navigation and the interests of various countries in China. Arita replied that the pending issues between Japan and the UK and the US were being resolved as quickly as possible. Kasai also asked whether it was true that the army advocated northward expansion and the navy advocated southward expansion. Hiranuma replied that both the army and the navy sought the development of national power based on national policy, and there was no distinction between northward and southward expansion. Kasai's words were an indirect question about friction with the navy, but Hiranuma's reply was irrelevant. Morita of the Seiyukai questioned that if work on rear construction was not fully promoted, would it hinder "long-term construction?" Hiranuma replied that rear construction would inevitably be suspended due to the increase in military spending, and he would try his best to save other expenses to meet the needs of rear construction. From this question and answer, it can be seen that the × people's rear construction has completely stopped, and the so-called "long-term construction" has no extra strength. ×'s predicament is more than half over.</p>

<h3>British Authorities Order Resumption of Naval Emergency Reserve; French and British Foreign Ministers Separately Meet Soviet Ambassadors; Soviets Decide to Maintain Franco-Soviet Alliance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] It is learned that British authorities have announced that the Royal Navy's "Emergency" Reserve Force is to be reinstated. This reserve force was established in 1912 and abolished after the war. Its purpose is to be able to quickly summon personnel of all ranks (including signalmen and telegraph operators) in times of emergency. They will serve for a period of five years before the Royal Proclamation for the conscription of all reserve forces, and will be paid one shilling per day.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador Suritz yesterday. It is rumored that the talks were related to the recent news of trade negotiations between the Soviet Union and Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax this evening, for reasons unknown. What is noteworthy is that Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz also happened to visit French Foreign Minister Bonnet at the same time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon and briefed him on the details of the Rome talks. Maisky, in turn, explained the commercial negotiations that the Soviet Union and Germany were about to undertake. Regarding this matter, Soviet sources here say that these negotiations were initiated by Germany, and the German side may take the opportunity to inquire about the Soviet Union's attitude should something happen in Western Europe in the future. As for the Soviet Union, it will maintain close contact with Poland. During talks with German leader Hitler earlier this month, information was provided regarding the situation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and it was stated that it was unlikely to promote the separation of the Ukrainian republic. The intention was to shift Germany's attention to the West, which is greatly appreciated. Furthermore, the current Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union should provide military assistance to France if Germany attacks France. However, if France is attacked by Italy, this mutual assistance treaty cannot be implemented. If the member states of the League of Nations can invoke the covenant at that time, the Soviet Union can still provide assistance to France in accordance with the terms of the covenant.</p>
<p>British Three Ministers Roar Like Lions: Military Strength "Unmatchable"</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] British First Lord of the Admiralty Stanhope published an article in the newspaper today, stating that after the beginning of 1939, Britain will launch at least one new warship every week. The shipbuilding plans of Japan, France, Germany, and Italy cannot catch up with Britain. Therefore, in the next two or three years, Britain will be superior to any other country in terms of warships. The scale of Britain's naval expansion today is unprecedented in British peacetime history. The most important warships currently under construction include seven battleships, twenty-one cruisers, fifteen destroyers, fifteen harbor patrol boats, and five aircraft carriers. Of the seven battleships under construction, four can be launched within this year. Air Minister Wood said today at the opening ceremony of a newly established aircraft factory that the monthly production of aircraft in Britain in 1938 has doubled compared to before, and the quantity this year may double again. The quality of the aircraft will also be better than before. Furthermore, Home Secretary Hoare gave a speech in Harwich yesterday, saying that the British army, navy, and air force will be "unmatchable." Note: Since last September, when the European situation became tense, Britain has remained silent. Now, the ministers of the navy, air force, and home affairs are all roaring like lions at the same time. Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver a speech in Birmingham tomorrow, and at that time, Britain will have another opportunity to roar. Has the British Cabinet decided to adopt a tough stance in order to arouse the people's patriotism, while at the same time warning the dictators of the world? The Prime Minister may express this during his speech.</p>
<h3>Four-Power Conference; France Opposes Holding It; Italy Denies Convening</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th] How to resolve Italy's various demands is a major problem at present. According to well-informed sources, the French government is unwilling to convene a four-power conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, following the Munich conference method, to find a solution. When Foreign Minister Bonnet and Premier Daladier gave speeches in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, they expressed the idea of convening an international conference, the purpose of which was to solve all the problems related to various countries, and should not be confused with a four-power conference. However, German newspapers took the opportunity to attach themselves and said that the French officialdom had approved the four-power conference, which is not true. According to sources in Rome, the Italian government will propose to convene this conference in the near future. As for France, it refuses to recognize Italy's unilateral abolition of the 1935 agreement, and the only acceptable solution is to hold direct talks with Italy, and is unwilling to submit this dispute to any conference for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 27th] It was previously rumored that Mussolini intended to propose convening a four-power conference after the fall of Barcelona to resolve the Spanish problem. Officials here have now denied it in a statement. They also fear that French Foreign Minister Bonnet's advocacy of convening an international conference in his speech to the Chamber of Deputies is not yet the right time.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Supplies France with a Large Number of Aircraft; Roosevelt Has Agreed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] U.S. President Roosevelt announced today that U.S. aircraft manufacturers have obtained government approval to supply a large number of aircraft to France, the quantity of which is not limited.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee will investigate the matter that the President and the government have allowed France to purchase 600 U.S. aircraft worth $65 million.</p>
<p>[Foreign News] A U.S. Curtiss Hawk pursuit aircraft made a free flight in Buffalo, New York, with a speed of over 575 miles per hour. All previous speed records cannot be compared with it. According to Curtiss factory personnel, this aircraft can even fly 600 miles per hour. It is reported that this aircraft is one of the hundred ordered by the French government. The pilot said that he did not feel any adverse effects during the flight.</p>
<h3>The All-Union Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party Will Be Held on October 3rd; Stalin Will Report on the Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 27th] The plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party is scheduled to be held on October 3rd, before the National Congress of the Communist Party. The agenda of this plenary session includes the report of the Central Executive Committee, the report on the Five-Year Plan by Stalin, and the implementation report by Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov. Furthermore, the drafting of amendments to the Communist Party's political program by a special committee has also been included in the agenda.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Peace; Opposing Aggression; U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles Gives a Speech on Current Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] Under Secretary of State Welles gave a speech at a banquet of the New York State Bar Association this evening, briefly stating that the current foreign policy of the U.S. government focuses on maintaining peace. The attitude of our government and people towards the policies implemented by certain governments has not changed. In other words, whenever humanity suffers from cruel and inhumane treatment, the United States has the right to protest and provide assistance. This has been clearly expressed before, and this right should be exercised in the future. If the foreign policy of any country threatens the peace and security of the United States, infringes on the United States or infringes on American citizens, the United States should also resist it when necessary, in accordance with the rights it possesses under existing treaties. In short, the goals of the U.S. government are nothing more than (1) to promote friendship with all countries, (2) to promote foreign trade, (3) to maintain the legitimate rights of American expatriates in foreign countries in accordance with existing treaties, (4) to restore the rule of international law to resist violence, (5) to restrict and reduce various economic barriers that hinder international trade, and (6) to establish international agreements to limit land, sea, and air force armaments. Welles then summarized various international events since the Great War and concluded that events in which humanity inflicts certain cruel behaviors on their fellow humans, even during the European War, are difficult to believe to be true, but are now commonplace. Before 1914, if a government dared to kill women and children, or kill ordinary people during wartime, it would definitely be despised. At this point, we see this kind of practice every day.</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Continue to Advance Northward; The Government's New Capital Is Again Bombed; Mussolini Rewards Aggression</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 28th of This Newspaper] A person in charge of external debt discussed that the Spanish Civil War has taken a sharp turn for the worse due to the fall of Barcelona. The situation in the Mediterranean has changed immediately. Italy, in its triumph, will further demand colonies, etc., from Britain and France. Europe will be in turmoil from now on.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 28th] Spanish rebels are advancing along the Mediterranean coast and have reached the small town of Sant Celoni de Vilasar, 35 kilometers from Barcelona. Furthermore, Spanish rebels occupied the industrial town of Badalone yesterday, on the north coast of Barcelona, with a population of about 25,000. The rebels are still advancing north, about 25 kilometers away, chasing the retreating government forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Perpignan, France, 28th] The city of Figueres, the location of the Spanish government, was bombed yesterday morning. Details are unknown, but there must be hundreds of deaths.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 28th] Yesterday at noon, Spanish rebel aircraft bombed Valencia. A British ship was sunk, but there were no casualties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Perpignan, 28th] The situation in Figueres, the location of the headquarters of the Spanish government forces, was extremely chaotic yesterday. Government personnel were looking for their departments, ministers were looking for their colleagues, and weeping mothers were looking for their lost children, and begging for bread to fill their stomachs. Refugees have nowhere to settle, crowding together to avoid the cold of war. The authorities are now working hard to organize them and prevent refugees from fleeing chaotically into France. Guard posts have been set up along the Franco-Spanish border, and warning lights flash at night to indicate the border. The snow on the roads is very thick, sometimes up to ten feet. Some people are working hard to clear the thick snow on the roads. Many believe that the retreat of the government forces this time was very orderly, but its ability to resist seems to be only enough to cover the transfer of a large number of military supplies to the south.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 28th] Mussolini personally telegraphed General Gambara, commander of the Italian forces in Spain, and appointed him as a division commander.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, 27th] Belgium and the Spanish government have resolved their differences. Chargé d'affaires of the Spanish Embassy in Belgium, Mr. Triva Zhenuo, has returned to Beijing as the country's chargé d'affaires in Belgium. Belgium has appointed its chargé d'affaires in Spain to return to his post.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Prague, 27th] The Czech government has decided to recognize the Spanish National Army government as the legitimate government and establish formal diplomatic relations with it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Gibraltar, 27th] General Franco's representatives here held a "victory celebration" today to celebrate the fall of Barcelona. Guests gathered to sing the rebel "national anthem" and cheer "Long live Franco," "Long live Mussolini, Hitler." About 300 people on the street below who sympathized with the government forces responded with insults in English. Soon, a low-ranking rebel officer brandished a pistol to demonstrate, and the crowd mocked him again, resulting in a brawl. The city police were dispatched to suppress the fighting.</p>
<h3>Another Thousand German Jews Go to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Naples, 27th] A thousand Jews (mostly German) boarded the Italian ship "Berncamanono" today bound for Shanghai. They will seek refuge in China.</p>
<h3>Prominent Figures from All Walks of Life in Britain Broadcast to Germany; Appealing for Efforts to Prevent War; Sincere Cooperation to Build the Future</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Today, "British Broadcasting Corporation" representatives of twelve famous figures from all walks of life in Britain delivered speeches in German to Germany, asking German leaders and people to "make their utmost efforts to prevent the scourge of war." The above-mentioned famous figures include: (1) Former Governor-General of India, Sir Wellington; (2) Sir Poppey; (3) Governor of the Bank of England, Norman; (4) Poet Laureate Masefield; (5) Famous Doctor, Sir Dawson; (6) Famous Doctor, Sir Horder; (7) Famous Athlete, Sir Burghley; (8) Architect, Sir Lutyens.

Let us each, in a spirit of freedom and willingness, cooperate sincerely to build a bright and splendid 'future,' so that we can not only preserve the existing civilization, but also pass it on to future generations, so that they will have one more experience."</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Asks for Emergency Appropriation; To Purchase a Large Number of Fighter Planes; The Senate Rejects the Relief Bill</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] President Roosevelt asked Congress for an emergency appropriation of $50 million to purchase 565 new-style army fighter planes. Roosevelt previously proposed a $552 million military expansion plan, and this emergency appropriation is only the beginning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] The government's relief amendment has been rejected by the Senate. According to the amendment, the United States' relief funds should be increased from $72.5 million to $87.5 million. The bill was proposed by the Senate committee and passed by the House of Representatives.</p>
<h3>The Recent Internal Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>Summer Cloud, translated from Soviet Truth Teaching (Continued)</p>
<p>This kind of declaration is to persuade the general public to endure hunger without complaining. However, the result of malnutrition has made the health of the Japanese working masses increasingly weakened. According to a newspaper report, there are currently 154,000 people in Tokyo suffering from tuberculosis. The number of deaths due to tuberculosis is also increasing daily. In 1936, in Tokyo alone, 14,925 out of 80,836 deaths were due to tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Under this harsh environment, the Japanese working masses only saw one way out. However, those reorganizationists who were supported by the ruling class betrayed the interests of the working class, causing their strikes to fail and being subdued by the rulers.</p>
<p>The Japanese working masses also wanted to turn the Social Democratic Party into a united front party. Therefore, during the general election on April 30, 1937, the Social Democratic Party won 37 votes due to the support of the workers, more than half of the 18 votes in 1936. However, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party once again betrayed the working class. One of the leaders even openly declared that "the cabinet should adopt resolute policies like Hitler and Mussolini."</p>
<p>Within this year (1938), many workers in large factories went ahead of the leaders of the Social Democratic Party and prepared to launch a strong strike to demand a salary increase. Japanese newspapers reported that "labor unrest is growing, the number of strikes is increasing month by month, and the scope of the strikes is gradually expanding, with participants including doctors and female workers, almost all walks of life."</p>
<p>A large amount of ××</p>
<p>In Japan, as long as there is a slight criticism of the warlords, there is a possibility of being arrested (many workers have already received this treatment). From this point, we can see that this ×× invasion war of Japan is not protected by the general public. Where can we see the rise of this anti-war sentiment? We all know that Japan has announced the implementation of the National Conscription Mobilization Law. However, after the announcement of this law, many workers refused to report to the mobilization station. This is one example. At the same time, the tragic situation of the soldiers who returned wounded from the front gave them a deep impression, making them further realize that the beneficiaries of this ×× invasion war are only the bourgeois and military adventurers, and they themselves only suffer.</p>
<p>Is now leading the heroic struggle of the general working masses to carry out anti-fascist and anti-warlord adventures.</p>
<p>Now, the growth of the proletariat's political power in Japan and the wave of strikes are the main forces that make the Japanese government panic. At the same time, if Japan's military adventures in China continue to be undermined, then its internal situation will inevitably move towards a more serious and deteriorating stage.</p>
<p>A Short Comment</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu Denies × Rumors</h3>
<p>According to an Associated Press dispatch from Peiping on the 28th, Wu Peifu's spokesman angrily denied the recent propaganda by the Japanese side regarding rumors about Wu being a puppet. This further shows the shamelessness and boredom of the × treacherous conspiracy. However, it also shows the viciousness of the × traitors in resorting to rumors and criticisms of those who are unwilling to be used by them. Wu was able to uphold national righteousness in the past and was not insulted by Japanese × and traitors, which is not only Wu's personal glory, but also the glory of the Chinese nation. We have always hoped that Wu will adhere to righteousness, love the motherland, and "preserve his integrity in his later years, and preserve justice in the world." We also hope that others who are surrounded and threatened by Japanese × traitors can write about their great benevolence and courage, preserve their purity, firmly uphold righteousness, eliminate party prejudices, and recognize the common × Japanese invaders and ×× Japanese aggressors."</p>
<h3>×× Traitors' New Ugly Drama</h3>
<p>The Japanese invaders, in view of the increasingly serious internal and external crises, and in view of our country's insistence on uniting to resist the war to the end, and will fundamentally break their "quick battle and quick decision" plan, therefore, on the one hand, they inevitably have to "exhaust the pond to get the fish" and intensify the search for and exploitation of domestic and occupied areas, preparing for and supplementing their greater offensive; on the other hand, they have to intensify the implementation of the conspiracy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" and rehearse the ugly drama of "establishing a new central regime in China."</p>
<p>The intention of the × treacherous people to rush to rehearse the ugly drama of the "new central regime" is, first, to attempt to unify the puppet regimes of the traitors in the occupied areas, strengthen their ruling power, in order to control and plunder all living and non-living forces to support more crazy aggressive military forces. Second, to use slogans such as "seeking peace" and "anti-communism" to paralyze our people, split our unity, stop our resistance, and then reach the point of destroying our country and nation.</p>
<p>Recently, in the north, they have expanded the propaganda of "Wu Peifu being pro-Japanese and seeking peace," while in the south, they have used the Japanese-owned newspapers ×× Daily and Wang Jingwei's privately run ×× Daily as the center to expand the propaganda of "anti-communism," "ceasefire," "peace negotiations," and "pro-Japanese," and fabricate rumors and heavy bribes. The urgency of their conspiracy to establish a pseudo-central regime is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The Japanese × and traitors' conspiracy activities will inevitably become more crazy and vicious when they are on the verge of desperation, which is to be expected and not surprising. But we still need to pay attention to, first, any Chinese sons and daughters, we all hope that they will respect themselves and Wu Peifu was a former old warlord, but in recent years, he has been able to stand in the demon's cave and be awe-inspiring and not be used by × traitors, so we express our special respect to him. Second, we should know that all those who cannot overcome the × temptation of benefit, threat, or willingly attach themselves to adversity are abandoning themselves in their individual capacity, and are enemies of the nation if measured by righteousness. They have been abandoned by the people of the whole country and cannot exert a ruling role through any organization. Third, Wang Jingwei has lost his capital to swindle and sell the nation since he exposed his pro-Japanese surrender face, and the general theory is fortunate for it, and the seal is indeed appropriate. However, if we do not pay attention to it, it is not only a mistake, but also a crime. Chen Cheng, Zhang Fakui and other telegrams to request the arrest of Mr. ×××× is an important appeal based on the blood and tears experience of more than a year of resistance. Now, Wang is not only unaware of repentance, but also uses his propaganda tools to spread rumors, incite chaos, sow discord, and secretly collude with Japanese × and traitors in the north and south. This can be seen as a state of lenient policy. Fourth, the lurking pro-Japanese traitors will inevitably use the smokescreens of "peace" and "anti-communism" more unscrupulously in the future to carry out their tricks of betraying the nation and the country. Our authorities at all levels and compatriots from all walks of life should always be vigilant and expose and crack down on them.</p>

<h3>Singapore Strictly Restricts the Import of Chinese Laborers; Ship Tickets to Singapore Suddenly Rise; One-Third Increase in Tickets for Men and Women Compared to Three Months Ago; Men's Tickets Rise to $280 Per Ticket</h3>
<p>The Singapore government previously repeatedly promulgated many new restrictions to maintain local unemployed workers, strictly limiting the entry of Chinese laborers, and reducing the number of male and female praying guests allowed to enter each month to 500. After the ban was issued, the number of male laborers going south from Hong Kong was greatly reduced, and the price of ship tickets suddenly rose. Recently, the (new passenger) male ticket has actually risen to $278, and the female ticket has also risen to $178, which is more than a hundred dollars more expensive for men's tickets and forty or fifty dollars more expensive for women's tickets compared to three months ago.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Authorities Set Up Classes in Different Districts; To Train Air Raid Wardens; Residents Are Encouraged to Actively Participate in Air Defense Lectures; Lecture Locations and Times Have Been Announced Separately</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Air Defense Authority is sparing no effort in preparing the necessary facilities for passive air defense, and is particularly active in carrying out the dissemination of air defense knowledge.

<h3>Bank of China Myanmar Branch Opens</h3>
<p>Our government, in order to develop the treasure of the southwest and strengthen the strength of the war of resistance, specially accelerated the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Highway to facilitate transportation. The highway has recently been completed and the traffic is smooth. In order to develop their business, many import and export merchants in Hong Kong have set up branches in Myanmar, especially the banking industry. The Myanmar branch of the Bank of China, which has been preparing for a long time, has been established, and the opening ceremony was held on the 14th of the month, which will be of great help to the industrial construction of the southwest in the future.</p>
<h3>Chen Gongzhe's Calligraphy and Writings Exhibition - Contributing Forty Years of Research to the Public</h3>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper - A calligraphy exhibition is usually a commonplace affair. However, an exhibition that combines calligraphy with writings is quite extraordinary. Just such an extraordinary personal exhibition opened yesterday at the Jinling Hotel.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen, speaking to the reporter: "This exhibition does not aim to attract business or promote myself. Rather, it focuses on contributing my research findings to society, providing a reference for those who come after, so that the 'later' ones can 'surpass' us. This is precisely the attitude that cultural workers should have."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen stated that he has studied calligraphy for forty years, during which he spent fifteen years on a dark and unjust detour. If one were to learn calligraphy using his scientific method, it would take ten years to achieve what he achieved in twenty-five years. By extrapolation, three years would be equivalent to ten years using ordinary methods, and one year would be equivalent to three years using ordinary methods. His method involves using firm bristles like wolf hair or rabbit hair, instead of soft sheep hair brushes. As for judging the quality of a character, he uses geometric curves as the standard. Mr. Chen describes himself as a semi-scientist and humbly claims not to be a calligrapher. He has authored books like "Scientific Calligraphy," of which four have already been published by the Commercial Press, with several more in the process of being printed.</p>
<p>Regarding the analysis of calligraphy, Mr. Chen stated that the importance of dots accounts for 60%, the importance of structure accounts for 30%, and the importance of the flow of energy accounts for 10%. If one were to spend ten years learning calligraphy, according to the above proportions, six years should be spent on dots and strokes, three years on structure, and only one year on the flow of energy. It can be seen that the biggest problem with most calligraphy today lies in the inaccuracy of dots and strokes.</p>
<p>As for the content of this exhibition: there are eleven kinds of calligraphy writings, ten kinds of calligraphy tools, and nine kinds of calligraphy works, totaling about one hundred and several tens of pieces, all of which are very refined. But the most valuable are his inventions and creations: the scientific ink grinder, the center of gravity proof diagram, the calligraphy element system diagram, and the jade seal brush testing diagram.</p>
<p>In a social environment with a weak academic atmosphere, Mr. Chen's spirit of dedicating himself to research and invention is clearly worthy of our admiration.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Departed for Shantou and Ganzhou - Delegation Composed of Twenty-Five Members</h3>
<p>The newly formed third and fourth teams of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Youth Association Military Service Corps, after many days of preparation, yesterday (the 27th) set off with twenty-five male and female members on the Qingxing steamship for Shantou. It is said that after arriving in Shantou, they will pass through Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Xingning, detour into Jiangxi, and first go to Nanchang to join the second team, and then meet with military commanders to await orders for assigned work. It is reported that this delegation is carrying many tools, including a record player, a movie projector, films, bicycles, books, pictorials, and medical supplies. They are also carrying about three thousand cotton-padded jackets and vests donated by the people of the rear to the soldiers at the front, over twelve thousand comfort bags, and dozens of boxes of biscuits and candies.</p>
<h3>Western and Chinese Prostitution Den Raided on the Third Floor of the Asia Hotel - Female Chinese Affairs Secretary Xia Lixin Personally Led the Raid - Three Young Women and One American Girl Rescued</h3>
<p>Last Friday night, the Female Chinese Affairs Secretary, Xia Lixin, raided a case of private prostitution in the Asia Hotel on Connaught Road Central. At the same time, an American girl was discovered to be engaged in the same profession. It started when Xia received a tip from an informant that someone was hiding young girls in a certain room in the Asia Hotel. She immediately went with police detectives to conduct the raid. Upon arriving at the hotel, they went straight to the third floor and entered a certain room, where they indeed saw three young girls, about twenty years old, heavily made up. There was also a woman who appeared to be a madam inside. She immediately ordered people to watch over them and then searched another room, where she found a middle-aged man and a beautiful American girl living together. The girl was only fifteen years old. Xia questioned her and found that although she was American, she did not speak English, but she spoke fluent Chinese. Apparently, the girl had been brought back to China by her Chinese adoptive father when she was young and raised there. After further questioning, Xia learned that the girl, along with the three young women mentioned above, were being raised by the madam in the room. At the same time, another woman claimed to be the girl's manager. Xia arrested all of them and took them back to the Chinese Affairs Office for questioning. Later, the American girl was transferred to the Salvation Army camp for care, while the three Chinese girls were sent to Po Leung Kuk. As for the two women and the man, they were temporarily detained at the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Drivers and Mechanics - Go to Guilin to Serve - Du Qizhang Sends Them Off Yesterday</h3>
<p>Several dozen members of the Vietnamese Chinese Driver Service Corps, led by Ye Jian, arrived in Hong Kong a month ago, but because Guangzhou and Wuhan fell in succession, they stayed in Hong Kong. Fortunately, they received assistance from Mr. Du Qizhang, a local businessman, who introduced them to Chairman Zhou. They were selected into the Chinese Rescue Team, and the corps has now departed for places like KaiPing to serve. As for the drivers and mechanics, Li Jinshui, Du Zuzhen, and He Junpei, all four were also introduced by Mr. Du and recruited by the Political Department. They departed from Hong Kong yesterday to take a French postal ship to Haiphong and enter Guilin. Mr. Du, considering that these drivers and mechanics were serving the country, held a farewell banquet for them at the Wuchang Restaurant. During the banquet, he offered much encouragement and introduced them to the French postal office staff and Chinese community leaders in Hanoi and Haiphong to take care of everything.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter received news that a cargo boat had capsized near Tonggu in British waters, with three of the four people on board missing. Only the boat owner was rescued by another fishing boat and reported the case to the local police station. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded below. The cargo boat had no registration number. The boat owner's name is Chen Er, 39 years old. There were three partners on the boat: Liang Jinzhen, 51 years old; Gan Cheng, 26 years old; and Zhong, 38 years old. They set sail from near Tung Lo Wan in Chinese territory on the 24th of this month, fully loaded with fresh fruit and sundries worth a total of 140 yuan. At about 7:00 PM, when they were sailing near Tonggu in British waters, a sudden storm arose. The helmsman, seeing the situation, immediately turned the helm to avoid it and immediately lowered the sails. However, it was too late, and the entire boat was blown over by the gale. Everyone on board fell into the sea. But it was nighttime, and there were very few fishing boats. Their calls for help were ineffective. The boat owner clung to a wooden plank and drifted with the waves. However, he could no longer see any trace of his three companions. It is likely they were taken by the sea gods. Chen drifted on the sea all night. Until the morning of the 25th, he saw a fishing boat in the distance. Chen shouted for help, and the fishing boat rescued Chen and brought him aboard. After being rescued for a long time, his spirits finally calmed down a bit. Later, the fishing boat returned to the Hong Kong police station to report the case. The on-duty assistant stated that he would send a water police boat to patrol the sea area where the accident occurred to search for the three missing companions.</p>
<h3>Hainanese Overseas Chinese Congress - Successfully Concluded - Special Meeting Held Late Last Night - Executive and Supervisory Committee to Meet Today</h3>
<p>The Overseas Hainanese Chinese Representatives Congress concluded last night after a declaration. The congress held nine meetings in ten consecutive days. More than thirty motions from representatives of various ports were fully discussed and passed. Yesterday was the last day of the congress, and more than forty representatives attended, chaired by Fu Zhifeng. In the morning session, after the second reading of the constitution was passed, discussions focused on membership fees. The representatives conducted detailed research on this issue, which took a long time. It was originally planned to start the election in the afternoon, but it could not be held as scheduled due to issues with the election law. The representatives believed that the executive and supervisory committee members of the general association must be separately elected by representatives from various ports. Only in this way could the strength of the general association be increased. Therefore, the election of the executive and supervisory committee members of the general association was postponed until last night. A special meeting was held at 8:00 PM, and the election was not completed until around 11:00 PM. The congress then concluded last night. Today, the executive and supervisory committee members will hold a meeting.</p>
<h3>Fishermen's Free School - Preparations Begin - Relief Committee Provides Monthly Aid of One Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association previously submitted a detailed plan to Mr. Xu Shiying, Acting Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, stating that the number of fishermen in distress has been increasing in recent years, and their livelihoods are on the verge of collapse, requesting relief. In the plan, in addition to establishing a fishing reclamation area, establishing a fishermen's free school is also a key item in the relief plan. It is now known that Mr. Xu Shiying has accepted this plan. The person in charge of the Fish Association received a reply from Mr. Xu yesterday, stating that preparations will begin on February 1st, with 1,500 yuan in national currency for start-up costs and 1,000 yuan in national currency per month for expenses. The Fish Association is currently proceeding with all preparations. The plan is to first establish one school in each of the three major fishing areas: Shau Kei Wan, Aberdeen, and Cheung Chau, with a temporary enrollment of 100 students per school. The Aberdeen and Cheung Chau Fishermen's Associations already have two existing fishermen's schools, but they are very small in scale, with only dozens of students. It has now been decided to expand them. New methods will be used in the Shau Kei Wan area. It is hoped that classes can begin around March of this year.</p>

<h3>British Army Commander - Arrives Back in Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Major General Grasar, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in China, left Hong Kong at the end of last year to inspect the British Army units in Shanghai and Tianjin. He returned to Hong Kong from Shanghai yesterday (the 28th) morning on the British mail ship Empress of Canada, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Captain St. John.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Seamen in Hong Kong Prepare to Return to China - To Participate in Transportation Work - Seamen's Leaders Have Begun Organizing</h3>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War began, the seamen in Hong Kong have been extremely active in patriotic movements. However, since the Seamen's Union was disbanded, this activity has come to a virtual standstill due to the lack of leadership. Recently, Feng Yongyou, the founder of the former Chinese Seamen's Industrial Joint Association, came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou via a roundabout route, intending to join forces with Hong Kong seamen's leaders Wang De, and Guan Yusheng, to organize Hong Kong seamen to return to northern Guangdong and assist the government in undertaking transportation work. Preparations are now complete, and they will likely depart during the day.</p>
<h3>Refugees in Guangxi Are Everywhere - Suffering from Hunger and Cold, Urgently Awaiting Relief - Guangxi Refugee Association Sends Letter to Relief Association - Calling for Allocation of Funds to Relieve Refugees in the Province</h3>
<p>Refugees are everywhere in Guangxi, urgently awaiting relief. Zhang Zhaotang, Zong Jun, and He Haiyu of the Guangxi Refugee Association yesterday presented a letter to the Hong Kong All Circles Relief Association, requesting that funds be allocated to relieve the refugees in the province. The letter stated (excerpt): Since the establishment of the Southwest Military Headquarters, Guangxi has become the center of the Anti-Japanese War in the Southwest. Therefore, enemy aircraft frequently fly over and bomb, causing severe damage. Refugees are displaced and suffering from hunger and cold. Although the government is rushing to provide emergency relief, the disaster area is vast, and it is difficult to provide widespread assistance. We have long admired your association's compassion and far-reaching benevolence. Therefore, we dare to write a special letter, appealing for your assistance. Please find a way to quickly raise large sums of money and remit them for relief, so that the dying victims of the disaster can be revived and forever grateful. Looking forward to good news from afar.</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Residents' Association Established</h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>Hoping it can truly benefit the residents</p>
<p>In the midst of a slight lull in the tidal wave of rent increases and forced evictions by landlords, the issue of water bill payments has once again stirred up many waves between landlords and tenants. At a time when these waves are growing, the official establishment of the Hong Kong Residents' Association has suddenly been announced. This is such happy news for the general residents!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sun was hiding in the clouds, and Old Man Sun seemed to be putting on an ominous and cold face, making people shiver. It was a little after four o'clock in the afternoon, and the top of the Sihao Hotel suddenly became lively. Representatives from the trade union, shop owners, and people from the education sector were threading their way up to the second floor. The spacious hall was almost full of people. It was still early for the meeting, and everyone chatted idly, gradually shifting from national affairs to the issue of water bills. Inevitably, many disputes have arisen between landlords and tenants. Everyone sighed in despair when they talked about this!</p>
<p>After the music was played, lawyer Ma Gu-Si Lu-Hua stood up and unveiled the red curtain, and the golden characters of the Hong Kong Kowloon Residents' Association were brilliantly reflected in everyone's eyes. After the unveiling, he began to announce the purpose of the Residents' Association: "The purpose of this association is charitable. It is not only a legal advisor for residents, but it will also continue to plan free medical care for residents, establish free schools for residents' children, and protect all the interests of residents." At this point, he paused and continued to tell a story about a woodcutter, children, and branches, the gist of which was that a single branch is easy to break, while many branches are difficult to break, so he hoped that everyone would work together to benefit the community!</p>
<p>Next was the chairman's speech, but because the chairman had not arrived, it was given by Li Zeyie as a representative. After that, Jian Bingquan reported on the preparations. He clearly explained the benefits of joining this association: in the future, if a member is subjected to forced eviction and needs legal resolution without success, the general association will come forward and handle it on behalf of the resident according to the law. This method is quite good, although it has not yet been determined who will bear the litigation costs!</p>
<p>In addition, it is said that if anyone who joins the Residents' Association has any difficult problems or emergencies, the association will provide assistance in planning and offering solutions. The benefits for members are said to be numerous, so there is a great rush to join. As of last month, there were already 4,487 people, and with an entrance fee of three dollars per person, there are already over ten thousand dollars. The solicitation of new members continues, and it is unknown how many more there will be. With such abundant financial resources and such strong manpower, everyone hopes that this Residents' Association can achieve great results!</p>
<p>It is said that before the association was established, there were already more than 200 cases of members being subjected to forced eviction and water meters being cut off who requested legal assistance, which shows the seriousness of the forced eviction and water bill trend, and the concern of the community for this association. Finally, the vice-chairman earnestly said that the association should be more universalized to benefit the working masses of the lower classes!</p>
<p>After the vice-chairman's report, the guests continued to give speeches, which were generally expressions of their great expectations for this association. When the meeting ended, everyone went home with joy, and at the same time, they also hoped that the association would soon show results!</p>
<h3>The Active Huibao People's Guerrilla Force (1)</h3>
<p>— Rouzhi</p>
<p>Special Correspondence from This Newspaper - The emergence and development of the Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force sent a signal to all the people of the East River region - a signal that the people are automatically participating in the Anti-Japanese War to defend their homes and strive for the liberation and victory of the people. The significance is very important.</p>
<p>Many of the people in the Huibao area participated in the struggles of the Great Revolution era. After the failure of the Great Revolution, there was considerable hidden strength for struggle. Moreover, many young people from the Huibao area who left their hometowns accepted the mission of the times and automatically took on the responsibility of saving the nation. Under the promotion of several groups such as the Huiyang Youth Association and the Chuxian Le Society, when the situation in South China became critical, they actively participated in the work team to return to their hometowns. They returned to the Huibao area to carry out the work of propagandizing and organizing the masses, and mobilizing the masses to defend their homes. Thanks to their efforts, the work progressed extremely rapidly, and the initial foundation for the armed organization of the masses was laid.</p>
<p>On October 12th of last year, the sounds of enemy artillery attacking South China rang out near Aotou. In Danshui, Pingshan, Longgang, Kengzi, Kuiyong and other places, which were closest to Aotou and where work had been carried out most thoroughly, the people, under the leadership of the work team, mobilized and prepared to strike at the enemy. The small number of armed forces concentrated at this time were the early form of the current Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force. When the enemy harassed this area, Zhu Changcheng's guerrilla force at any time carried out attacks on the enemy by selecting favorable terrain and time. Although they did not achieve a great victory due to insufficient strength, they did pose a considerable threat to the enemy. At the same time, they also coordinated with the 151st Division of the regular army, led by Wen Brigade and Ma Battalion, in combat. Their resolute and courageous actions had a significant impact on the regular soldiers. Each battle expanded the number of troops and increased their weapons. At first, there were only a dozen people with a few guns, but now it has developed to hundreds of people with hundreds of guns. Moreover, they also have heavy machine guns, light machine guns, and hand-held machine guns. This is very obvious: the Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force grew and developed in battle. What does it show? It shows that the Anti-Japanese War is not weakening our strength, but strengthening it. Who says the strength of the people is not great? Who says that victory cannot be achieved after the Anti-Japanese War?</p>
<p>The Huibao Guerrilla Force was organized by a group of resolute members of the returning work team and some brave local cadres. Before its official establishment, it automatically fought several battles in places such as Mayuan, Bagang, Henggang, and Sanshitian. Because their actions were correct, they gained the love, support, and endorsement of the local people. Furthermore, they gained the trust of the local defense forces. At the beginning of last month, they submitted a request to the government and were officially established as the "Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force." Zeng Shengjun, an active anti-Japanese youth from Huiyang and a leader of the Southern Seamen, was appointed as the commander-in-chief in charge of command. From this point on, a batch of young and strong seamen workers were mobilized to join, expand the organization, and accelerate development. Many members of the village militia self-defense teams also voluntarily joined with their guns. At the same time, a portion of the Dongguan Baoan self-defense force, after withdrawing from Dongguan Baoan, because they lost contact, also came here to join forces. Therefore, the momentum of the guerrilla force became increasingly strong.</p>
<p>Danshui City was recovered on the 7th of last month. The first to enter the city was the Huibao Guerrilla Force. As soon as the guerrillas saw that the enemy was retreating, they sent a group of soldiers in civilian clothes to enter the city first. As a result, the traitors of the Maintenance Association were preparing to escape, but they were captured alive. After the enemy retreated, the guerrilla force entered the city in formation and then called on the residents to return and held a grand mass meeting. They shot and killed these three dogs, and did not seize their property. The hearts of the whole city were greatly delighted.</p>
<p>The actions of the guerrilla force are always active. Although the enemy has retreated far away, and this area is no longer the front line, they are constantly preparing for the new wars of the future. Every day after getting up at dawn, they gather to practice running and basic techniques. After breakfast, they attend political and military classes. In the afternoon, they hold exercises, field operations, or street fighting. In the evening, they hold meetings to discuss and review, and sometimes they also camp out to practice night battles.

<p>The Significance of the Symposium</p>
<p>Lu Fu: Since the expansion of our Shen Bao at the end of last year, it has become a new cultural department for promoting the War of Resistance and national reconstruction! In order to promote film and drama, we have specially published this Film and Drama Weekly. Since its inception, we have received enthusiastic love and help, encouragement and cultivation from all seniors and comrades, which on the one hand makes us infinitely grateful, and on the other hand makes us more aware of the importance of our own responsibilities.</p>
<p>Everyone is certainly well aware of the important role of the film and drama movement in the national liberation struggle at this stage; and everyone also knows that the current state of film and drama, such as the inability of the northern and southern film circles to shoulder the task of wartime art, and the struggling and suffering of emerging drama in the nascent stage, requires us to make greater efforts to correct and promote it. Therefore, in order to pool our wisdom, connect our feelings, launch collective discussions, establish correct theories and criticisms, and promote the film and drama at this stage, we have specially initiated this "Film and Drama Symposium." We are very honored that all seniors and comrades have enthusiastically come to participate!</p>
<p>The format of our symposium is very casual. We hope that we can hold it regularly once a week or every two weeks. Each time, over tea and laughter, we will determine a working theme as the center of discussion. On the one hand, we hope that this symposium can comprehensively review the current situation of the film and drama industry, and on the other hand, enable our comrades to have closer ties with each other. In this way, everyone will also feel it is very meaningful!</p>
<p>Key Topics for Discussion</p>
<p>A few days ago, I talked about this issue with several seniors, and everyone agreed. At the same time, they also pointed out several main tasks in front of us, such as: 1. Establishing progressive film and drama criticism; 2. Establishing correct film and drama theories; 3. Promoting the new stage of film and drama movement; 4. Launching a film and drama purification movement...etc. We need to conduct detailed collective discussions.</p>
<p>Today, the central topic of our discussion is "Establishing Progressive Film and Drama Criticism" because criticism plays a very important role in promoting the film and drama movement. We know that without criticism and review, it is impossible to expect anything to have normal development and progress. The leap forward of the Shanghai film industry after January 28th was largely driven by the efforts of progressive film critics. This work is, of course, urgently needed in Hong Kong, where the cultural level is so low. Now, what we need to discuss is how to establish this critical work, as well as how to recognize the needs of the environment and the times, and determine the criteria for criticism. At the same time, after the principles of this issue are decided, we will further try to use the current performance of the China Art Drama Troupe as the object of our criticism, because it is the emerging central group of the Hong Kong drama movement, and this is its first official performance. It is of great significance to the drama movement in Hong Kong. I hope all seniors and comrades will not hesitate to express their opinions on this issue and conduct detailed collective discussions.</p>
<p>Several Important Principles</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian: The Shen Bao Film and Drama Weekly organizing this symposium is of great significance. The topic to be discussed today is also an important task. We know that progressive film and drama criticism plays a very important role in the film and drama movement at this stage. In order to enable critical work to play a greater role, we should establish a critical center and establish a critical goal. First, the content of the critical center is the most important, but there are also many things to pay attention to in the content. As the War of Resistance has progressed to the current stage, the scripts that initially praised the War of Resistance are no longer sufficient. Now we need newer forms, newer styles, and newer content. This is what we should pay special attention to. After the content is determined, the critical evaluation of performance techniques is also very important, because only with good techniques can good content be expressed, making it more substantial and powerful. Second, criticism has a propaganda effect, so we cannot arbitrarily praise or criticize based on personal preferences. We should have a correct common goal. This goal, of course, is to use whether it benefits the national War of Resistance as the criterion. In this way, we will have a basis for determining what should be promoted and what should not be promoted. Third, film and drama criticism cannot be uniform, because the material conditions for film are much more complicated. At the same time, emerging drama is now struggling in its nascent stage and has not yet gained social status, so our attitude towards criticism should be more tolerant and supportive of its growth. At the same time, there is also a distinction between professional and non-professional theater troupes in drama. The techniques of professional troupes are certainly more skilled, and the material conditions are certainly better. However, the working attitude of non-professional troupes is more courageous, and the audience is more extensive, so our critical attitude is also somewhat different. Fourth, due to environmental reasons, there are some things that we should criticize but cannot. For example, in the Shanghai film and drama circles after August 13th, there were few good things and many bad things. However, the bad things were supported by certain forces, making it impossible for us to carry out correct criticism. In this case, we should criticize the good things and not criticize the bad things, letting them live or die in front of the eyes of the audience. This is a good way.</p>
<p>Film in Destruction</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng: Film and drama, these two sister arts, have great differences in quality and quantity because they are used and grown in different environments. Just now, Mr. Ouyang said that film and drama criticism should be separated, which is very correct. Now, I will also talk about this issue separately: First, let's talk about film. After January 28th, film critics made great contributions to the progress of Chinese film. Under the supervision of progressive intellectuals and the establishment of progressive film theories and criticisms, and stimulated by this moment of national life and death, and inspired by progressive intellectuals, film workers had an unprecedented awakening, which made the past films for art have a very obvious transformation, abandoning the old dross and coordinating with the new cultural movement. However, after the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, the general new cultural movement unfolded with the War of Resistance, but film, as an important part of the new culture, declined with the unfolding of the War of Resistance. Now, except for the China Film Studio and the Central Film Studio, which are supported by the government and bravely shoulder the glorious task, the once vigorous film culture movement, regardless of north or south, is all on the road to destruction. From the perspective of historical evolution, film, as an integral part of the new cultural movement, should have been more heroic and active, following the people's resistance and bravely moving forward, shouldering the greater tasks it should have shouldered, but why, on the contrary, did most of it embark on the path of decline, and some can even be said to be anesthetizing our people and enslaving our people for the benefit of the × people? What a painful fact this is!</p>
<p>Two Reasons for Destruction</p>
<p>Here, to determine how to establish progressive film criticism, we must understand why film has become the weakest link in this War of Resistance, even avoiding it and embarking on a path of betrayal. The reason for this is: First, film production is not as simple as other arts, and requires more capital to support it. Behind every film worker stands an investor, a film merchant, who can control everything about you. Because the current Chinese film merchants still maintain the operating methods of the handicraft industry, everything is only conservative, without development, only seeking profit, without understanding, and even less knowing the important mission of film culture and the tasks that wartime merchants should shoulder in the national liberation struggle. Therefore, under the storm of the great era, they are naturally unable to resist and "resigned to fate, tending to collapse and destruction, even going to the path of depravity at will." Second, because most of the Chinese film workers lack strict training, sufficient cultivation, correct understanding, and firm will, and at the same time, they value their personal life and enjoyment too much, so when they encounter the turmoil of extraordinary times, they rarely do not panic and do not know what to do, and instead let others manipulate them!</p>
<p>Advising Merchants to Wake Up</p>
<p>Based on the above two reasons, Chinese film during the War of Resistance will inevitably lead to tragic results. This is an inevitable law. Therefore, to remedy this tragic situation and correct this serious mistake, we must address these reasons and immediately establish progressive film criticism. Use our sincerity, our tongues, and our pens to awaken every film merchant and film worker, and awaken every anesthetized audience.</p>
<p>First, we must tell all film merchants that in any country or nation, when encountering an unprecedented life-and-death crisis in history, all works that face reality, have content, have life, and are full of encouragement for combat emotions will be enthusiastically supported by their people. In the past, some film merchants spread the atmosphere of the disastrous business of national defense films as a cover for the production of toxic films. Here, we must solemnly and sincerely point out that the national defense films they are referring to are not real national defense films, and most of them are pseudo-national defense films that ruin the reputation of real national defense films. Real, substantial, and meaningful national defense films will never fail to make money. Under the principle of determining that national defense films will definitely make money, encourage them to engage in the creation of real national defense films, awaken and work hard to obtain greater profits. At the same time, point out the serious crisis if they do not wake up!</p>
<p>Overcoming Slogans and Formulas</p>
<p>Second, we must overcome the production of all sloganized and formulaic national defense films. We must solemnly point out to all film workers that real national defense films do not necessarily have to shout "Down with ××" or be full of scenes of war or beating × people and traitors. Instead, they must realistically and realistically report to the audience the story of how we are oppressed and how we should seek survival. We must tell every film worker that if they do not have sufficient skills, correct understanding, plus a lack of practical life experience, the result will be just an accumulation of rote slogans and formulas, and they will not be able to produce moving good works, even if they have a good theme. As for mistakenly seeing the so-called "business acumen" and incorporating some low-level taste materials into it, that is even more undesirable. Such "pseudo-national defense films" will inevitably make the masses feel that the content is empty and superficial, and feel tasteless, and even feel disgusted and avoid them. As for the production of sensual, low-level, folk tales, and toxic films, we must severely point out the darkness ahead.</p>
<p>Unleashing the Power of the Masses</p>
<p>Third, our critical work must go deep into the audience class. We must give detailed, sincere, and popular criticism of the content and technology of every film production in order to improve the audience's level of appreciation and choice. We must certainly promote the good ones, and we must strictly criticize the bad ones, so that every audience does not run into the cinema in a muddle. At the same time, we must make every knowledgeable mass understand how to get good spiritual food in the struggle for national liberation, and how to help establish national defense films, starting from themselves, and persuade close relatives and friends not to watch toxic films, and actively encourage them to watch meaningful and real national defense films. In this way, our criticism will have the greatest effect. Even if film merchants and film workers still do not wake up and want to continue to do things in a muddle, it will no longer be possible!</p>
<p>Promoting Mass Drama Movement</p>
<p>Regarding drama, because this sector has not yet achieved the so-called "commercial status" in society, and capitalists do not have a close relationship with it, it still relies on some art workers who are interested in drama itself or who regard drama as an effective propaganda tool to firmly support it in difficult and arduous environments. Also, because these art workers have a more pure attitude and clearer understanding, although drama in China is still in its infancy, and is even constantly shaking in the wind and rain, after the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, it has grown up in this great beacon, and has achieved brilliant achievements that surpass the past twenty years. Not to mention the domestic situation, just in Hong Kong, this cultural desert, under the vigorous promotion of cultural organizations such as the China Art Association, the national defense drama movement has also leaped forward. Looking back on the Hong Kong drama movement in the past year, the number of performances that can be counted has reached more than 200, and there are now 30 to 40 large and small theater troupes. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, in this cultural desert, because of the low cultural level, drama does not yet have a considerable social status, and has not yet won the love of the masses. Our criticism in this regard must certainly be more tolerant, and take an attitude of promotion and encouragement. The most important thing, in addition to improving the technical aspects, is to overcome the past mistakes of some drama workers who only engaged in art for art's sake and only rolled around in a small cultural circle, and vigorously promote the practice of popularizing drama, so that it can develop universally. Especially for the general small theater troupes, we must give greater encouragement and provide guidance with experience in all aspects, so that they can exert their passion and strength as much as possible among the broad masses. Although most of them are inevitably naive, they can easily grow up in the struggle.</p>
<p>Drama Movement Status</p>
<h3>Youth Drama Association's Second Joint Performance</h3>
<p>The Youth Drama Association is a general organization of youth drama groups in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Under the urgent requirements of a united front and improved work efficiency, the association appeared in Hong Kong, a "cultural desert," with a brand-new attitude. We should express our infinite wishes while feeling gratified.</p>
<p>They held a joint performance last year. Now, they have again selected to hold a joint performance for three nights starting today (January 29th) at South China Middle School. The performing groups and plays for the first night tonight are: New Voice Theater's "Contributing Strength"; Lushui Theater's "Reunion"; Dingchou Theater's "Under the Sun Flag"; Whirlwind Theater's "The Hatred of the Blind and Mute"; and Red and White Theater's "Reporting Blood and Loyal Souls," five one-act plays in total. The second night tomorrow night will feature: Xuezhen Society's "Three Rivers Good"; August 13th's "Our Guerrilla"; Amateur Friendship Society's "Black Shadow"; China Amateur's "The Last Plan"; and Guangdong Drama Association's Hong Kong Fellow Association's "Chinese Daughter." The third night the day after tomorrow will feature: Gong Theater's "Seeking Life from Death"; Ordinary Theater's "Return Our Children"; and Rendou Theater's "Spring's Smile." It is reported that at the same time, the China Amateur Choir, the Youth Tongle Society, the Guangzhou Fengshe Chorus, and the China Bookstore Fellow Chorus will also participate in singing. This is a very meaningful joint performance on the Hong Kong drama scene.</p>

<h3>Long Live the Youth Drama Association</h3>
<p>— Cai Chusheng</p>
<p>This is a very honorable thing. I have had the opportunity to occupy a seat in the sea of people in the audience at almost every one of the several performances by the Youth Drama Association of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and even the various units participating in this organization. Seeing their spirit of not avoiding any difficulties and hardships, and their attitude of always working conscientiously, I am truly ashamed—because of their absolute meticulousness, the performance results are very good, and I am given infinite emotion every time.</p>
<p>In the past, Hong Kong was considered a "cultural desert"; drama was even considered a "no-man's land." Now, not only do the larger-scale drama groups have good performances; the smaller-scale groups are also booming. In Kowloon, there are more than 20 drama organizations, and these organizations have broken through the most difficult barrier to unite - the establishment of a general institution, and the establishment of the "Youth Drama Association", continuing to do large-scale joint performances, which and the "Sunday Small Theater" composed of more than 20 small theater troupes in Shanghai after the War of Resistance, are enough to shine north and south.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, this "desert" is now full of many drama flowers. This phenomenon should be a matter of great pleasure for everyone who pays attention to the cultural movement on this island.</p>
<p>Naturally, these newly budding flowers are inevitably fragile. Most of them do not have much experience, not much financial resources, and not many talents, and paper relies on the youth's enthusiasm for the country and nation to irrigate and cultivate them. It is certainly more difficult for them to develop and grow quickly. Therefore, I especially hope that they can often gather all their experience, manpower, and financial resources in a general organization, and work together to irrigate and cultivate, which can not only play a great role in the entire drama movement, but also enable the workers of each fighting unit to make rapid progress in experience and technology. This is a work that is needed and necessary in launching a mass drama movement.</p>
<p>The Youth Drama Association should be a very ideal organization for youth drama workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon. No matter how many unavoidable difficulties and unavoidable gaps there are temporarily, as long as we recognize that this work is correct in the big premise, then we should take out the heart of loving our own unit to love this general institution, and under the perseverance and enthusiasm of everyone, all difficulties can be overcome!</p>
<p>On the occasion of the Youth Drama Association's second large-scale joint performance, I loudly shout:</p>
<p>Long live the Youth Drama Association!</p>

<h3>Planning Improvements for This Spring's Tea Production and Sales</h3>
<p>— Xie Yaoyuan</p>
<p>Specifically speaking, Shanghai's foreign tea firms are a distribution mechanism, while tea factories in tea-producing areas are the actual operators of the tea business. Shanghai's foreign tea firms provide financial support to tea factories and distribute their manufactured tea leaves (i.e., boxed tea). Since Shanghai's foreign tea firms bear economic responsibility, they should provide necessary supervision and guidance to tea factories. However, the organization of Shanghai's foreign tea firms is not yet sound, and they cannot fully fulfill their responsibilities. In tea-producing areas, tea factory operations primarily focus on technical aspects. However, those managing them are often not specialists, and their education levels are extremely low. I have often encountered such tea merchants who even ask what foreigners need these tea leaves for, which is very regrettable. As for the state of overseas markets, they are even more ignorant. Such lamentable phenomena, I don't want to deliberately overstate, but there's no way to avoid mentioning it. Both internal and external operations are perfunctory and aimed solely at maximizing profits. Old habits are followed, and old rules are adhered to, which is not conducive to the development of the tea industry. This is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Since the tea industry is declining due to the aforementioned reasons, it is difficult to revitalize it because merchants have limited capital and knowledge. Therefore, government control is urgently needed. However, the idea of control has been around for years, but partly because merchants are limited by immediate interests and have many unnecessary suspicions, failing to genuinely cooperate with the government, and partly because the government has not actually implemented it, it has not achieved significant results. This year, the government established a Trade Commission under the Ministry of Finance to control foreign exchange and adjust international trade, and tea is included as one of the items managed by the commission. Thus, control is being realized. Now, let's try to comprehensively review the current state of control.</p>
<p>Tea leaves are seasonal agricultural products. Merchants operate by raising capital in advance to establish factories, produce, and sell. This inherently involves certain operational steps. The Trade Commission's control over tea transportation and sales was implemented in the later stage of this year's tea business. The tea leaves manufactured by merchants had already become finished products and had been transported to export ports, ready to be shipped to Shanghai for sale. The Trade Commission issued an order to implement control, suddenly preventing transportation and export. Although merchants obeyed the order, they were filled with apprehension because they did not understand the true meaning of control. Therefore, business in progress was completely halted.

<h3>Intense Football Match Today: South China South Faces Eastern Again; Police vs. Scots Also Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>[Our Report] South China has returned, and football affairs are heating up again. Today's league features two first division matches. South China South, after a brief hiatus of over twenty days, will appear and showcase their skills amid the eager anticipation of fans.</p>
<p>South China South vs. Eastern is a good show that is sure to be pleasing to the eye. Remember when the two teams first met, South China South won 5-0. But today, as they meet again, South China South may find it difficult to repeat that previous achievement. Moreover, South China South players Li Tiansheng and Mai Shaohan have returned from injuries and are not yet fully recovered. They are勉强 appearing today.</p>
<p>Since Sun Jinshun's mid-season departure to Shanghai, Eastern's strength has not been affected in the slightest. In fact, their record has been even better. This is because of their unity and singleness of purpose.</p>
<p>Li Si said: "My right foot has not yet healed. I've been practicing with my left foot lately, and it's been quite satisfactory."</p>
<p>In short, Eastern wants to avenge their previous defeat, while South China South wants to consolidate their position as champions. Therefore, an intense battle is inevitable.</p>
<p>The Police vs. Scots match, because it is unrelated to the championship situation, the outcome is not important. However, the two teams are evenly matched and there will also be a fierce fight. (Football Grand Duke)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Student Tennis Team Arrives in Hong Kong for Challenge; Six-Member Team, Match Schedule Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Although Shanghai has become an "isolated island," sports are still active and full of vitality.</p>
<p>Tang Baojia (John's), Li Guofan (Jiao Tong), Cai Guoji (John's), Wei Zhenxing (John's), and Xu Peizhi (Shanghai University), who are quite reputable in the Shanghai tennis scene, were selected by the Chinese Tennis Association to form a student tennis team to challenge Hong Kong, the "second isolated island."</p>
<p>The team's trip to the south was sponsored by Black Brothers Toothpaste Company. A Shanghai newspaper also specially made uniforms to present to the five players to boost morale.</p>
<p>Secretary Jiang Jiehe and a group of six people left Shanghai on the Empress of Canada on the 26th and arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning. They are staying at Room 410, Hotel des Nations.</p>
<p>They will stay in Hong Kong for about ten days and play about four or five matches. However, the match schedule is undecided and is still being negotiated. Tentatively: (1) against the Hong Kong University student team, (2) against the South China team, (3) against the Hong Kong Football Club team, and (4) against the Chinese Recreation Club team. After competing in Hong Kong, they will go to Macau for one or two matches and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to Li Guofan, they were originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for the south on the 31st of this month. However, as they were free during the winter vacation, they came to Hong Kong early. During the voyage, Guo Ji caught a cold and fevered up to 103 degrees. He is currently recuperating and may not be fully recovered and able to perform.</p>
<p>This afternoon, lawyers Luo Wenjin and Luo Wenhui hosted a welcome reception for them. Cai Yongshan, the He family team, and others accompanied them to Stanley Villa for practice.</p>
<p>These tennis players are very energetic and have considerable tennis skills. In particular, Tang Baojia and Li Guofan's doubles partnership has been well-known in Shanghai. They were selected for the Shanghai-Tianjin intercity competition last year. This time, they will contribute a lot.</p>
<p>The match against the South China team is said to be scheduled for 2:30 PM on February 5th (Sunday) at the Kowloon Recreation Ground tennis court. South China has already selected (singles) Chen Zhiqiang, Chen Funan, Chen Jinman, (doubles) Lü Guifang, Ma Nai , Li Junxiong, and He Xianqin to compete. The five players are listed below: Tang Baojia: All-Shanghai Chinese Singles Champion, Li Guofan: All-Shanghai Chinese Singles Runner-up.</p>
<p>(Note: Tang and Li have won the All-Shanghai Chinese Hard Court Doubles Championship and the All-Shanghai Open Hard Court Championship and were selected for last year's Tianjin-Shanghai intercity competition.)</p>
<p>Wei Zhenxiang: St. John's University Singles Champion</p>
<p>Xu Peizhi: Shanghai University Singles Champion</p>
<p>Cai Guoji: All-Shanghai Junior Singles Runner-up</p>

<h3>South China Hua vs. Hong Kong Football Club</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the First Division League match between South China Hua and the Hong Kong Football Club was held at the Caroline Hill Ground. The stands were deserted, the atmosphere was relaxed, and there was nothing much to say. Hong Kong Football Club was missing key players. "Big Daan" Fopula was tired and out of form, and Yi Shidulanqi was drafted to fill his position. "Little Daan" E Fopula resembled his brother and played with his brother's style. The Hong Kong Football Club did not have enough players, so they used Second Division players to form a team. The Second Division players, who had fought two battles in a row, looked dejected. South China Hua's center midfielder Lin Depu injured his foot, and Yang Genbao returned to defend the center. At the same time, Lu Dakeng replaced Li Shuoyou, who had been imprisoned for a year, and the left-wing offense was somewhat reduced. However, the whole team played well together and, against the weak Hong Kong Football Club, they not only did not expose any flaws but also played with ease. Eighteen minutes after the start of the game, Chen Dehui led a fierce attack, dribbled deep, and shot hard, hitting Gao Lusi's body and bouncing out. Gao Lusi pounced again from the goal, and Song Sheng, who had been waiting in front of the goal, lightly added a kick, and the ball rolled into the empty net. 1-0, South China scored first. At 30 minutes, Jin Hong crossed from the wing, and Shui Yi copied it into the corner of the city, casually scoring another goal (2-0). Then the half-time whistle blew. Changing sides and fighting again, Hong Kong made some progress, but it was short-lived. Mo Shen was in distress. At 25 minutes, Dehui dribbled close to the goal, aimed accurately, and scored again (3-0). At 28 minutes, Hong Kong Football Club's left inside midfielder Mei Ling committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Shi Kua took the penalty and scored with a powerful shot (4-0). Two minutes later, Shui Yi took advantage of the transportation from the rear and shot coldly from the right wing, the ball flew into the net (5-0). Gao Lusi could not help but be dumbfounded. Until the end of the game, South China won 5-0. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>(South China Hua)</p>
<p>Tan Junqian, Liu Mao, Liang Bowei, Xie Jinhong, Yang Genbao, Liu Weipei, Lu Dakeng, Qu Shi'e, Chen Dehui, Liu Songsheng, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Football Club)</p>
<p>Gao Lusi, Mei Suidun, Ji Shi, Xiaozaola, Shi Jiannaiyi, Ge Yun, Bangdi, Bi Fu, Tulanzhi, Pi Yashi, Wei Luson</p>

<h3>Football Intelligence</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Special Report] The Hong Kong Football Club has been declining in recent years, and its strength has been greatly reduced. The "Great Altar" prestige has disappeared. Especially in this season, since the team's expedition, they have lost more than they have won, and there is nothing much to say. "Fat Shi," who was once famous, has seen that the situation is over and is no longer interested. He has not often participated in the war lately. It is learned that the team's pillars, Bickford and Skinner, will soon leave Hong Kong to return to England. If so, the team's lineup will be even more incomplete. It is also heard that Liao Yazhen of the Kowloon Football Club has also left.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter from a Filipino reader in Hong Kong was published in the South China Morning Post, stating that the Hong Kong-Philippines intercity football match is approaching, but it is not known whether Li Huitang and Da Gaoshanu have been selected for the Hong Kong team. The Filipino people have always admired these two famous football players in the Far East. If they are selected this time, many Filipinos will come specifically to see them.</p>
<p>The Philippine intercity football team will have three matches in Hong Kong in the future. The first match is the intercity match, and the second and third matches are exhibition matches. Someone suggested that any player who has represented Hong Kong in the intercity match should not be selected for the exhibition matches. If this is the case, players with good skills who have not been selected for the intercity match can have the opportunity to show their skills in the exhibition matches. This suggestion is very reasonable. However, if our China United team adopts this method, its strength will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee invited Li Huitang to go north to participate in a football charity match, which is scheduled to be held on the 20th and 21st of next month. However, Huitang will have the intercity match in Hong Kong at that time, and there will be a charity match on the 26th, so he cannot go north on schedule. According to Huitang yesterday, going to Shanghai is an unavoidable duty, but he hopes that the Shanghai side will reschedule the match to March 4th or 5th, otherwise it will be difficult to comply.

<h3>Guanghua Valiantly Resists Middlesex; Three to Three, Spring Colors Evenly Divided</h3>
<p>Guanghua and Middlesex played against each other at So Kon Po Ground yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. As a result, each team scored three goals, dividing the spring colors evenly. Yesterday, Guanghua's rear defense was very solid, especially Li Guoqi and Hou Rongsheng, who performed very well. The three midfielders were criticized for their lack of energy and slow movements, which prevented them from resisting Pearson and Shushi's attacks. The five forwards coordinated better than before. Shi Jin, Wenzhi, and Chifen all had tacit cooperation, so they were able to draw with the strong Middlesex team. On the Middlesex side, because Generals Watson and Gegen left Hong Kong to return to England, although there were replacements, their strength was affected. There was a reason why they did not win. As soon as the battle began, Guanghua attacked first. Shi Jin and Jiao Zhi jumped forward, like fish in water, and rolled into the hinterland, but they were eliminated by Bidi's kick. Middlesex launched a division to invade. De di took the lead and passed through several passes. When he reached the last kick in front of the goal, he shot diagonally into the wilderness. After that, Guanghua was attacked very quickly. Seeing the enemy riding vertically and horizontally, the danger was everywhere. Fortunately, all the generals were able to do their best and fight to the end, and the capital was temporarily protected. After a period of fierce fighting, Guanghua counterattacked in the meantime. Jing Cong smuggled in from the side, but the Middlesex midfielder line was strong and was eventually defeated. Without what, the Middlesex army came to invade again, forcing a corner kick. Marabu took the main kick. The ball fell to the left of the goal. Pearson intercepted it and passed it back to the center. De di rushed to the top in time and slanted into the net, winning the first goal. After Guanghua's loss, they tried their best to counterattack. Chi played the ball forward, passed short to Wenzhi to shoot, but was caught by Ji Chen and kicked back to the center. Pearson intercepted and passed over Zixiang and shot at the goal. The ball came from the left corner of the goal, as fast as a shooting star. Fortunately, Guoqi reacted quickly and jumped up to save it. Soon, Guanghua was in a hurry again. A melee broke out in front of the fight. In the killing, the referee suddenly whistled and punished Guanghua with a penalty kick. Pearson shot the ball in the net. Before long, the first half ended. After resting, they fought again. The Middlesex army continued to attack, but Guanghua's generals gradually became active and changed to low-ball short-pass counterattacks. The ball was kicked far by Wenzhi and passed to Shijin. Zuhan's resistance was ineffective, and Shijin sloped into the net, paying the Middlesex army back one. Before long, Guanghua turned bad luck into good luck. Bingjin's teacher rose from the frontier, cut the ball in the middle, and Fenji flew over people, and rushed to it in time, and then hit it into the door, leveling the game again. At this time, the battle situation gradually became tense, Mi put all his strength into the attack, surrounded and attacked for a while, and finally Chen Shishi took the opportunity of Marabu's pass in the middle and scored a goal, and Guanghua was not weak, taking advantage of the opportunity, and Wenzhi shot at the goal, Guba intercepted it, Jing Cong rushed, took the ball and before the plate, buckled and shot in, and became a tie again. Before long, the battle ended, dividing six goals.</p>

<h3>Alice Marble's Tennis Ascent Secrets (5): Old Court Lovers</h3>
<p>Regarding the serve technique, I also advocate using the Continental grip. This has considerable assistance in speed, accuracy, and spin. Based on my experience, I think it is enough for women to learn two serving methods: flat serve and slice serve. And never learn the American-style serving method, because in women's physiology, the muscles of the back are definitely not as strong as men's. Making forced twists and turns is prone to injury to the back muscles and tendons.</p>
<p>The slice serve technique I use myself has no mentor. I learned it myself by watching men's ball games in the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. But now I think that the benefits of this serving method do not compensate for the depletion of physical strength, so I also hope that one day I can completely get rid of this serving habit. In other words, this is not a good example. Now that I'm used to it, it has become a bad habit, but it's difficult to change it for a while.</p>
<p>Many female tennis players think that if they can use the topspin serve, it will be a killer trick in hard court competitions. However, I want to advise you not to think like this. If this method is not used properly, it is no better than the flat serve and the bottom-cutting serve that are not laborious. At the same time, I want to make further forceful admonitions. The topspin serve can be said to be completely useless on grass.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that one day, most of our American female tennis players will have an effortless serving method, because serving is based on being effortless and avoiding being forced. I hope that my female comrades will not doubt that I am selfish and thinking of secretly trying to develop a serving method to seek self-achievement. You must know that I am a born athlete, and I am lucky to have a teacher who saw that I had a natural athletic ability, and with her patient guidance and my own long-term hard practice, I was able to play this trick. If a person without these conditions wants to learn from me, I dare to believe that he will eventually ruin himself, not to mention that I also feel that I should abandon this serving method. In short, the topspin serve is really too difficult to learn and is by no means necessary for women.</p>
<p>The secret of serving is to never hit the ball low. If you toss the ball three feet above your head when serving, and the movement of the racket should wrap around below the neck, then when hitting, the racket should first face the sky and then forward to hit the ball. As for after hitting, the racket should follow the remaining momentum around to the left of the body and hang down in front of the left foot, which is to use this remaining momentum to make the ball fly out quickly. It is a natural need that the racket's remaining momentum must be lowered before it is finished, otherwise the ball will not be powerful. For me, whether the serve is effective is more important than whether other techniques are good, because this is the focus of defense. Whether the serve is effective affects the outcome of the game, just like the serving in baseball and the moment of using the club in golf. It all depends on the power and method you use when you are about to serve.</p>

<h3>Movies and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment... First Love</p>
<p>Love Finds Andy Hardy</p>
<p>Every film about the Hardy family offers the audience fresh enjoyment. These films are filled with authenticity and can reasonably portray a wealth of interesting life experiences. Their vivid depictions almost allow the audience to personally experience everything in the film, moved by the family's joys and sorrows. This film, "First Love," the fourth about Judge Hardy, offers a profound and realistic depiction of the romantic psychology of young men and women. Andy (played by Mickey Rooney) is caught up in a love affair, juggling three women: one he genuinely loves, one he is looking after for a friend, and another who is a sincere and enthusiastic friend who offers him much help. At the same time, the family faces an unfortunate event: Andy's grandmother is seriously ill, her life hanging in the balance, and his mother has left home to care for her. In this situation, they prepare for a somber Christmas. But suddenly, the mother returns with good news, bringing them a gift of "comfort," and the family celebrates a joyous Christmas.</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney puts in extra effort in this film, achieving even better results than in previous films. Louis Stone, as a thoughtful and sincere elder, is the most outstanding character in the film. In addition to the original cast, a singing child star, Judy Garland, is added. Her sincere and moving expressions, and her clear and delightful voice, also occupy an important position in the film.</p>
<p>Queen's Cinema... Paris Honeymoon</p>
<p>Paris Honeymoon</p>
<p>The story is simple, and all the scenes rely on the support of the actors. The performance is lighthearted and delightful, and the cast is quite complete. Unfortunately, the actors are not used to their best advantage, and some of them fail to fully showcase their talents.</p>
<p>The story tells of a millionaire from the American West who brings his fiancée to Paris because she needs to finalize her divorce with her former husband there. He first stays in a rose village, where he meets the local Rose Queen, a little girl who constantly causes him trouble, whom he calls "Little Headache." They unintentionally fall in love. Meanwhile, his fiancée in Paris rekindles her romance with her former husband. He then marries the Rose Queen.</p>
<p>The film features several lovely songs sung by Bing Crosby. Shirley Ross and Edward Everett Horton don't have much to do in the film. Akim Tamiroff, a star known for playing villains, plays a comedic role here, and does quite well. Franciska Gaal gives a lively and excellent performance.</p>
<p>Oriental... Swiss Miss</p>
<p>Swiss Miss</p>
<p>The story is simple, about two rat poison merchants (Laurel and Hardy) who suddenly have the idea to do business in Switzerland. However, not only do they not succeed in business, but they end up having to work as waiters in a hotel. These two foolishly clever guys create many jokes.</p>
<p>There are two European singers in this film, especially the female one, who has a very good voice. Laurel and Hardy's performance is no different from their previous works.</p>
<p>Grand China... Everybody Sing</p>
<p>Everybody Sing</p>
<p>Starring Judy Garland. Her singing voice may not be as moving as Deanna Durbin's, but she is still an extremely talented newcomer. The film is about a family of theater enthusiasts, and the performance is focused on comedy and song and dance. It is a typical Hollywood musical in color. Besides singing, Judy Garland's expressions are also good. Allan Jones is not as outstanding as in "A Day at the Races."</p>
<p>New World... The Real and Fake Empress Wu Zetian</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>A commodity film that attempts to attract viewers with its sensuality. It centers on a stage actress with a strange sexual proclivity, using her performance as Empress Wu Zetian on stage and her licentious private life as material. The content is strange and absurd, but it may cater to low tastes. The so-called sensual scenes are not thorough, disappointing viewers interested in such things and disgusting ordinary viewers.</p>
<p>Central... The Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>Viewers who have seen the previous installment will remember that at the end, Golden Chrysanthemum was still being fought over by Zhou Zhicheng. This sequel picks up from there, continuing until Golden Chrysanthemum returns home. The plot is not as tense or convoluted as the previous installment, and the performance is also very lax. However, there are still many moments that can evoke tears from some foolish viewers, such as Kuang Shanxiao being framed and imprisoned, and Xiao Yanfei visiting him in prison. The consistent style of folk tales is unavoidable. We can guess the plot of the film without having seen it, and indeed, that prediction is not wrong. Cao Qiwen is not suitable for this type of film. The set design and cinematography are passable for South China, but the sound recording is a failure.</p>

<h3>"X Horse"</h3>
<p>— Cao Zhongren</p>
<p>— New Impressions from Battlefield Travel —</p>
<p>A certain gentleman came to talk and asked me, "When the horses of the X people are captured by our army, do they lower their heads to show shame and repentance?" I was very ashamed; I had neither seen nor heard of such a thing. I showed him many photographs of our generals riding captured X horses, looking proud, with no sign of repentance. However, it would be interesting to see an X horse that had come from the battlefield and was determined to become a monk, but unfortunately, we do not have that fortune.</p>
<p>Because the gentleman brought up the topic of X horses, many friends who live on the battlefield shared their own observations. In a village near Lanling, a squadron of X cavalry was surrounded by our army. By the third day, in a tight iron enclosure, there was obviously no hope of breaking through. On the morning of the third day, an X plane flew low over the village and dropped a signal. An hour after the X plane flew back, there was a burst of intermittent gunfire in the village, followed by silence. Soon, our army broke into the village, where they found more than forty X soldiers lying dead, along with more than fifty X horses: some of the horses had only one ear left, and some had only one eye left, standing there drenched in blood. Several of them truly became one-eyed dragons, and are still pulling carts in our herds today. The X people's horses are quite handsome, plump, and with shiny coats.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff G recounted an incident he personally witnessed in southern Shandong, which sparked a new topic from Military Commander W. He said, "The X people's horses are too beautiful, making it difficult for us. The horses given to us by the 106th Division are enough to form a guerrilla team, and a dozen of them are so beautiful that they are said to be a precious breed, requiring special fodder brought from their own country. We cannot afford to raise these noble horses, and they are too heavy to lift, so we can only let them starve to death in the fields." The gentleman laughed, "Perhaps the X people's artists can paint a picture of righteous horses, saying that these young master horses were captured but unyielding, and died of starvation." After a burst of laughter, I added the words used by the X people themselves to criticize their own horses in "The Dead Soldiers of Zhu," they themselves said: "The mules and horses of China look like ghosts, skinny and small, dragging one step after another; but when it comes to walking, especially on muddy and rugged long distances, our top-notch horses are not as good as those ghostly mules and horses, enduring hardship and able to walk without falling down." This is a general explanation of the future fate of the Sino-Japanese war; the horses of the X people symbolize the fighting power of the X people.</p>
<p>Staff Officer T fought in Lanfeng, entering and leaving the cavalry column commanded by the notorious wanderer Doihara for more than ten days. He captured many horses one after another, and the horse he rode and the one the army commander rode were both captured at that time. His "Theory of X Horses" is also quite interesting, he said: "The character of the master is often expressed through the objects he loves; young ladies like pugs, and bandits want to keep a ferocious, wolf-like dog, these are all reflections of the master's character. The enemy has a common mindset about horses, which is why the "X Army's" horses must be fat and shiny, but they don't pay much attention to whether they are solid inside. We usually treat enemy horses as decorations; but when we go to the battlefield, I have to make another choice." Using the appearance of horses to depict the psychology of the nouveau riche, is quite profound when thought about deeply.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, there were also people who saw this point; wasn't Takahashi, the finance minister who was sacrificed in the February 26th Incident, talking about the emptiness of their own economic foundations? Lu Jin</p>
<h3>Alas! Alas!</h3>
<p>— Lu Jin</p>
<p>The "Far-reaching Force" that boasted of "occupying Shanghai in three days and capturing Nanjing in ten days" is naturally a bit stretched after a year and a half. However, the Chinese army is fighting more and more vigorously, and their political views are unified. Even if they want to encourage a puppet to open a "door of peace," it only exposes their own panic and baseness—this is called "riding a tiger and finding it difficult to dismount."</p>
<p>While guarding such a vast area and unable to advance, and with financial resources exhausted, the only options are to open opium dens, traffic in drugs, and make the expeditionary soldiers do some work to extract a little money. This "policy" called "prosperity" is also the last resort. However, with scorched earth and rubble everywhere, there is no way to "prosper," and no wealth to extract. Let the "slippery characters" beckon the Chinese people, "Come, come!" But unfortunately, a guerrilla team came, and the resident people suddenly all turned into "stubborn people." The wishful thinking of "numbing the people's minds" and "local requisitioning" is like lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot. This is called "a situation that is both funny and sad."</p>
<p>And now, even further, not only are financial resources exhausted, but even the troops will not be enough to distribute. However, there are still many methods to think of, such as organizing "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" and "forcing 1.35 million people" into service, which is indeed a poisonous policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." However, whether the Chinese youth in the guerrilla areas can be easily dealt with, they themselves are afraid that "whether it is safe to trust these armed Chinese is still in question"—this is "caught between a rock and a hard place."</p>
<p>In short, Konoe cannot protect the "guard" society, and Hiranuma Kiichirō probably cannot "pacify" this great disaster. Even if they loudly proclaim a "long-term war," it will be like drinking a hallucinogenic liquor, and they will soon see "Alas! Alas!" Li Huiying</p>
<h3>Military Notes</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Looking at the new-style building top, someone exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>"How can there be a building in this small mountain ravine?"</p>
<p>"Yes, what would they use a building for here? Could it be a villa for keeping people captive?"</p>
<p>"It's a chapel, right? The influence of foreign missionaries has always been deep into the countryside."</p>
<p>Gradually, we rounded the mountain bend, allowing us to see the entire facade of the building. It was a white two-story building, with an upside-down bucket-shaped Western roof, covered with red Western tiles, which were very dazzling. Because the length of the building was more than eight or nine bays, it looked spacious and grand. The windows upstairs were square, and the corridor ran horizontally in front of them, wide and stately, making the facade of the building look very imposing.</p>
<p>Our guesses failed to produce a satisfactory answer. If it were a Confucius temple, it would never be built in a Western style; a church building would not look like this either. Rich people would not raise silkworms here, and transportation is too inconvenient. So, besides these, what else could we guess?</p>
<p>Humans are curious animals, isn't that right? Just take our group as an example. When we first saw the building top standing in this small mountain village, we felt as curious as children; it is even rarer to see a building in a remote village than to go to the countryside to buy sugar. Now that the team has entered the small market street, to satisfy our curiosity, we put down our backpacks and ration bags and rushed over.</p>
<p>"That's the Confucius Temple."</p>
<p>The people on the street pointed us in the direction. In a small mountain village, to have the opportunity to visit the Most Sagely Teacher in a Western-style Confucius temple, isn't that rare?</p>
<p>Just after walking behind the street, a stone tablet by the roadside stopped us. "The place where Zilu asked for directions"—the writing was eroded by wind and rain and was unclear.</p>
<p>And so, I, a military man, remembered a story from the past about the Cultural Sage. Confucius got lost, not knowing which way was east, west, south, or north, and sent Zilu to ask for directions, which is how he found his way. This—all happened in the past.</p>
<p>The white Western-style building was still about 80% new, indicating that it hadn't been repaired long ago. Above the entrance, the four large characters "Wenjin Academy" were carved, the "Wenjin" used here is probably meant for the current students, because there was a small school wooden sign hanging next to it. On the tall lime wall outside the building, the slogan "Suppress the Communists" written by the "Bao Ba Tuan" remained.</p>
<p>This building was not a Confucius temple, but a small school. The paint on the floors upstairs was still very shiny. Occupying a whole building, the school's scale was not small, but now it was empty. The school was probably closed due to the current situation. Zou Xiao</p>
<h3>Hu Shaobao's War Achievements in Pacifying the X People</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>— National Novel Talks</p>
<p>The last volume, Volume 34, of Zhou Qingyuan's "Second Collection of West Lake" from the Ming Dynasty is "Hu Shaobao's War Achievements in Pacifying the X People," with methods for "Important Coastal Defense" attached at the end. Does it have a deeper meaning within? Otherwise, why would he make a story about pacifying the X people the final volume, and repeatedly tell the reader about methods of defending against the X people?</p>
<p>This short story is mostly based on Mao Kun's "Chronicle of the Suppression and Elimination of Xu Hai," from the Ming Dynasty. Many places are simply the literary language changed to vernacular, with some descriptions added.</p>
<p>One section tells the story of Wang Cuicao, a courtesan who entices Xu Hai to surrender, harming Xu Hai and it is quite moving. Her behavior is similar to that of Concubine Fei in the late Ming Dynasty. Kunqu Opera "The Tiger Assassin" is a famous play often performed on stage, and Wang Cuicao should also be excellent dramatic material.</p>
<p>Regarding Wang Cuicao, the "General Record of Pacifying the X People in the Southeast in the Jiajing Era" simply does not mention her, and Zhu Jiude's "Brief History of the X People's Rebellion" only has these few sentences: "On the 19th day of the eighth month of the 35th year of Jiajing, Hai knew that danger was imminent and an attack was coming that evening, so at the second watch, he secretly sent his two beloved concubines out of the camp to escape." The so-called two beloved concubines are Wang Cuicao and Green Sister.</p>
<p>The story of Cuicao is as follows: "Wang Cuicao was a prostitute from Lin'an. When the X pirates invaded Jiangnan, they captured Cuicao. The camp leader Xu Hai greatly favored and doted on her, respecting her as his wife. All plans were dictated by Cuicao. However, Cuicao pretended to be intimate with him, secretly hoping for his defeat. The governor's office sent Hua the Elder to persuade Hai to surrender. Hai was going to kill him, but Cuicao untied his bonds and gave him gold. Hua the Elder returned and told the governor's office, which sent Zhongjun Luo to persuade Hai, and also secretly bribed Cuicao with gold, jewels, and jade. Cuicao said calmly in the camp every day that great things were bound to fail and that it would be better to surrender. Hai made his decision. The governor's office mobilized troops, feigning surrender. They attacked Hai's camp. Hai, trusting Cuicao's words, did not prepare. The government troops rushed in, beheaded Hai, captured Cuicao alive, and annihilated the X people. The governor's office gifted Cuicao to the Yongshun chieftain. Cuicao left, crossed the Qiantang River, and said: 'Ming Shan treated me with learning, and I used state affairs to entice him to kill him; killing one chieftain and then belonging to another, how can I live?' She drowned herself in the river at midnight." (Excerpt from Mao Kun's Chronicle of the Suppression and Elimination of Xu Hai)</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian wants to adapt this story into a new Peking opera. With his skill in writing "A Biography of Liang Hongyu," to write about Wang Cuicao causing dissent between Ye Ma and Chen Dong, there must be some excellent and witty words. However, the fact that "she bribed Cuicao with gold, jewels, and jade" (Ji Qing's "Complete History of Sino-Japanese Wars Through the Ages" also says: "They sent spies holding hairpins and earrings to leave for Hai's two maids, who persuaded Hai day and night.") inevitably lowers Wang Cuicao's status and ambitions. Judging from the context, Cuicao had previously "pretended to be intimate with him, secretly hoping for his defeat," and later said herself, "I used state affairs to entice him to kill him." It can be seen that her determination was made before she was bribed, and she clearly stated that it was for the sake of the country, so how could gold, jewels, and jade move her? I hope that when Yuqian writes this play in the future, he can emphasize Wang Cuicao's killing of Xu Hai for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>Xu Hai was originally a Chinese, helping the wicked to do evil. This reminds us of the fishermen of Shidongkou, our country, during the August 13th Shanghai Battle, who led the enemy deep into the area, causing us to lose Luodian. Southern Jiangsu also quickly lost the dangerous areas of Suzhou and Wuxi because fishermen acted as traitors. Proving the present with the past, they are exactly the same. Yuqian has already vividly portrayed Wang Zhi in "Liang Hongyu," so he will surely be able to give us a "satirical painting" of a great traitor like Xu Hai.</p>
<h3>After Reading the "Challenge"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>Last December, I seemed to have read a piece of news in a certain newspaper saying that the commander of the X people's military headquarters in South China had sent a challenge to Chairman Chiang, but unfortunately, I did not have the good fortune to see the contents of the X people's challenge. I thought that the X people were good at writing, and could also be innovative and unique, and that the X people could justify all the ugly things that humans are ashamed to do with formal documents. Yesterday I bought a recent issue of "Literature," and it happened to reprint this "great work." This piece in the 1938 World Literature will add a lot of color.</p>
<p>No matter how carefully you examine the three words "Challenge," they don't seem like a Chinese product. It's probably a foreign product. I haven't heard of these three words before. Let's start with a few sentences and famous lines from the challenge:</p>
<p>"The sky is clear, as bright as the great sun, what fear is there of wind and clouds? Chiang XX secretly commits atrocities, plunging innocent people into the misery of charcoal..." This is the beginning of the challenge. After all, the people of the island nation are imposing as soon as they speak. At the same time, they repeatedly mention "the people," saying that the X people's invasion and aggression against other people's national sovereignty is justified, but we are not, and they are also "acting on behalf of heaven" and "relieving the people's plight," making them seem like benevolent teachers. I remember that on the morning of the "September 18th Incident," notices to reassure the people were posted everywhere on the streets of Shenyang, and their tone and wording were almost the same as this challenge. The bandits' behavior of the Kwantung Army was also to "relieve the people's plight," bullying the weak and plundering the strong. The X people claimed to be driving out the "evil warlords" for the people. It is true that the Japanese people's skill in playing with words and fabricating rumors is something that the people of the world should avoid. Now let me copy a paragraph from Honjō Shigeru's notice to reassure the people on the second day of the "September 18th Incident":</p>
<p>"...Our army only wants to punish the Northeastern military authority. Regarding the well-being of all people, this officer is most concerned and attentive. I have specifically instructed my subordinates to protect their welfare and cherish their lives. I hope that the Northeastern people will all take care of themselves and have no worries..."</p>
<p>This paragraph is a masterpiece from Japan in 1931 and is of course an important document that cannot be discarded lightly. Comparing it with the challenge issued by the South China commander last year, there is still not much difference. "Punishment" and "the people" are said too much, and they have become commonplace and uninteresting. However, there are still remarkable sentences in the challenge that must be mentioned. Such as:</p>
<p>"The fall of Guangzhou was achieved by the Japanese army with only one or two battalions. It is truly a sigh of pity... At that time, the Lingnan was full of fertile fields in the deep autumn, driving the refreshing wind, and advancing the army to decide the victory..."</p>
<p>The small people of the island nation are happy when they win, and their complacent and complacent ugly state is overflowing in words, much like a village child who picks up a nugget of gold and sells his advantage when he gets a bargain.</p>
<p>But what expresses the utmost pain is not in these high-sounding boasts, but in the ending:</p>
<p>"Claiming to fear protracted resistance and only showing one's back, merely invites the slander of being base and cowardly."</p>
<p>In fact, the strategy of protracted resistance is the tactic of "not attacking head-on" but "only showing one's back." Yesterday (23rd), X chieftain Itagaki, the Army Minister, gave a speech in the parliament, in which he estimated China's existing troop configuration, saying that there were still 110 divisions of troops that had not suffered any damage and were extremely strong in combat. Therefore, X chieftain had to tell the people of the entire island nation the most urgent request with the faithful words that "this Sino-Japanese war requires not only the efforts of the navy and army, but also the joint responsibility of the entire nation." Die chieftain Itagaki suffered greatly in the Battle of Taierzhuang and truly knows the advantages and disadvantages of China, is a senior officer of the X army, then his words can arouse the attention of all islanders. If we take Itagaki's words and compare them with the words "merely invites the slander of being base and cowardly" in the challenge, then the most ugly, base, and cowardly is not China, but Japan.</p>
<p>Last October, the Japanese army lost tens of thousands of soldiers in the Battle of De'an, fighting bloody battles for seven days and nights. If we talk about "sigh of pity," it is truly disgusting, a great over-war. However, the X army commander sent out a letter of surrender, asking for mercy and sparing of lives. The contemptible and pitiful ugliness is beyond measure compared to the challenge.</p>
<p>I often hear people say that the Japanese are the most capable of cheating the world, but they are also the most shameless people in the world. I will not be disappointed after reading "Challenge".</p>
