<h3 id="c1">英對華新貸欵成立 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>英國對華新貸欵，業經正式成立，此事不僅對於中英兩國關係具有極其重要的意義，而且對於我國抗戰前途，對於遠東以及世界情勢，亦將發生相當重大的影響，這是我們所不能忽視的。</p>
<p>我國政府自全面抗戰開展以來，曾以極大之努力，維持國家債信，穩定法幣價值，對外保障友邦在華利益，對內充實抗戰建國力量，二十個月以來，慘淡奮鬥，卒爲國際所贊美同情。最近我國財政部爲使法幣更臻穩定，乃舉債一千萬鎊，除半數由中國交通兩銀行負責外，其餘半數則向英國方面借取。英國政府鑒於穩定中國幣值，關係在華商務及其他權益之維護者至爲重大，加以國內人民及對華工商業務關係者的一致同情呼號，終得告成。英財相乃於前日（八日）在下議院宣佈中國穩定幣制的計劃已告成功，英方貸欵的五百萬鎊，由匯豐銀行及麥加利銀行合同貸出。由英國財政部對該兩行担保。西門財相並宣佈此款將由中英兩方合組經理委員會，委員共五人，除中英兩方各派代表兩人外，第五人由英國政府商得中國政府同意委任。</p>
<p>此次中國向英欵成功，在財政經濟方面的意義，當然非常重要，第一，是證明我國英勇抗戰二十個月以來，財政經濟方面不僅沒有日本方面的危機四發岌岌不可終日，而且基礎日臻穩固前途日趨樂觀，此種情形，並已獲得英國上下一致承認與贊助。第二，是足使我國法幣基礎，更臻鞏固。同時對於中外商業，各蒙其利。誠如宋子文氏昨日談話所云：「我國今日國際收支狀况，實已無慮外匯準備金之流出，今復由中英兩國之重要銀行，共組平準基金以應付今後市面之一切行動，而其撥出之資源，又數倍於中國銀行在過去期間內所運用之數額，無論中外商業，均極欽幸。蓋此於法幣之穩定，實有莫大關係焉」。第三也是特別值得重視的是足以打擊日本最近對强佔地區貨幣的陰謀。華北華中偽府，前曾宣佈從今日（三月十日）起，實行禁用我國法幣，而中英雙方乃於前一日宣佈中英新借欵成功，外匯平準基金成立，對於日本陰謀，當然是重大的打擊。第四，對於英國方面，亦有很大的利益，因爲日本侵華軍事發展結果，英國在華權益大受損害，最近華北之天津華中之上海及華南之香港，所有英國商務之受日方打擊者尤爲驚人重大，英國爲打破此種惡劣局面而維護其正當權益，唯有積極地予日乂以打擊，今日英政府此舉，可謂積極行動的第一步驟。</p>
<p>其次在政治方面，實際上更加值得重視，第一，證明英國已覺悟中國抗戰以來實力的雄厚及惟有積極援華，始能維護其遠東利益。誠如昨（九）日我國駐英大使郭泰祺氏所云：「英國政府此舉，足以證明中國政府財政上及行政上均具有雄厚堅定力量，英國在此時機與華合作，實示歐西各國已明瞭維持其本國及遠東利益，其最善之辦法，厥爲盡力予中國以合法的援助。」第二證明我國堅持團結抗戰，必能日益獲得國際信賴與援助，其情形與日本愈戰而愈見其國際地位險惡者恰恰相反。因此外交界咸認：「中英新借款之成功，將使中國人士倍感欣慰，蓋不僅物質上中國獲得援助，且深知此舉之足以保護中英兩國的權益及促進中英兩國的友誼也」第三，中英新借欵成立，對於民主和平各國援華制日運動，可以成爲極大的推進力量，蘇聯之將因而獲得進一步援助我國的便利，自不待言，美法兩國的物質援助運動亦將有重要的發展。美聯社華盛頓九日電卽稱：「政界方面認爲英國此舉，與最近美國貸欵二千五百萬與中國事有關，並謂英美準備採同樣步驟，在財政上援助中國」該社同日巴黎電亦稱：『法政府雖不欲宣佈貸款與華，但將以信用貸欵方式售汽車與中國。又訊法方復有不少工業家由法啓程赴華視察，關於滇緬鐵路，法方正與英國接洽合資建築。』這是一個新鮮的證明。</p>
<p>我們由中英新借欵成立一事，對於中英兩國友誼前途，對於國際援華制日運動前途，對於我國抗日戰爭前途，表示無限的欣尉與期待！我們更可藉此新的事實來粉碎一切對於抗戰表示悲觀失望，和失敗主義者蔑視和平陣綫力量主張停戰降日的論調！但是，我們在這裏仍舊不能不喚起各方注意者，亦有下列數點：卽第一，中英新借欵成立僅是英國援華制日採取積極行動的第一步表現，我們不僅要繼續努力推進英國和其他民主和平國家這種積極行動，同時還應努力淸掃阻礙此種行動的妥協調停陰謀。第二，英國這種積極步驟的斷然表現，其主動力一爲鑒於我國堅持團結抗戰的前途大有希望，一爲鑒於全英人民一致反對退讓呼號援華制日，保衞在遠東權益，因此我們一面要加緊內部團結堅持抗戰到底，勿使國際友人失望，一面還要進一步努力團結與發展國際反法西反侵略運動。第三，我們抗戰建國，必須是在「自力更生」原則下極力爭取最多的外援，但是絕對不是親日漢奸和失敗主義者所謂領事外援，欠在此國際情勢急轉於吾有利的形勢之際，必須加緊國內的團結和政治的進步，加緊集中全國所有生動力量到抗戰建國戰綫上來，因爲祗有全國生動力量總動員，才能保證抗戰建國的最後成功，才能保證國際援助的更加廣泛與持久。</p>

<p>【西安航訊】日本×閥崩潰的朕兆，已經發現了！經過這二十個月的長期戰爭，×國內經濟的不振，資源的竭枯，入超的繼續，財政的拮据，兵力的耗損，國際關係的惡化，以及戰爭的尙無止境，佔領區域的無法控制，我們抗戰的力量日益加强等等，因而形成其全國普遍的不安現象，如工人罷工，農民暴動，及其人民和士兵的反戰運動，這都是上述所謂『朕兆』的明顯事實，特別是這種反戰述動，將爲直接促成日本×閥總崩潰的重要因素之一。</p>
<p>爲舉世所矚目而含着血腥的平沼內閣，其所有的萬應良方，並不是先要加緊侵華戰爭以挽救其×閥末路，而是要先加强對其國內人民的剝削以挽救其無望的侵華戰爭，我們在目前雖然還不能說日本國內就會因此而爆發革命。然而無疑的日本人民和士兵的反戰運動將更擴大，漸漸的走近革命。</p>
<p>就日本國民經濟的結構言，反戰運動必然的要日見普遍。日本的工業發展是畸形的，就是資產集中而生產散漫。在城市工業中，中小企業佔着很重要的成份，戰爭的利益惟有營軍需工業的大資產階級才能享受，這些中小企業家很容易因國家的統制和戰爭的影饗而陷于破產的命運，而因大羣工人的失業必不可免。中小商人因國內購買力之減退，亦必蒙受捐失。在農村經濟中，封建地主握着大量的土地，生產沒有資本主義化，因而小農和佃農在農村生產中還佔着極重要的地位，受了戰爭的種種打擊之後。他們平生所過的牛馬生活，還要降低。試問日本的　農羣眾能對戰爭永遠持着放任的態度而使自己白白的餓死嗎？他們的反戰趨向，可以說是必然的</p>
<p>參加侵略戰爭的日本士兵，大部份來自田間，一部份來自城市的工人和中小商人中小企業的子弟，他們及其家庭都是最先受到戰爭禍害的，而且受禍最烈，他們的父母兄弟妻子天天在饑餓線上掙扎。他們自己受傷的受傷，殘廢的殘廢，陣亡的陣亡，被俘的被俘，而戰爭又無目的與止境，在這種情形之下，他們將會發生甚麼感想丫他們同是人類，他們必不能堅持戰爭，進一步自然也要趨於反對戰爭的。</p>
<p>日本的民眾和士兵中，自然不乏有先見的進步份子，他們在戰爭初開始時，就領導反戰運動。一年以前，我們在戰區中，就發現過日本士兵的反戰傳單，不過那時日本一般的民眾和士兵，在其×閥的欺騙之下，還沒有深深的嘗到戰爭的惡果而發生普遍的覺醒，反戰份子的活動，還未能深入羣眾，同時日本×閥的監視極嚴，他們的活動，也未易普遍。經過這一年多的悲慘戰爭，他們的活動，已漸漸的獲得有利的條件，所以反戰運動便日益普遍，日益深入。近來在山西戰場上，我們到處嘗發現反戰傳單，最近在晉西吉縣一個俘虜的身上，竟搜出十一張尙未散完的　　傳單，這傳單是石印的，紙張極薄，字跡工整，印刷淸晰，可見他們的技術相當高明，計劃也相當週詳。</p>
<p>有些人常常的對報紙上×兵反戰的紀載表示懷疑，他們認爲日本士兵學過長期含有毒素的國民教育，對侵華戰爭，不會輕於發生動搖，而且他們在其×閥的嚴密監視之下與欺騙之中，　反戰活動，也不易進行。然而正因爲如此，這種反戰運動之發生，才更有意義。無</p>
<h3 id="c4">躍進中的安徽 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>【本報特訊】自南京，徐州兩次大會戰以後，安徽已從極度的緊張中突然的寧靜下來。現在的安徵，雖不是戰事的中心地區，但在全面抗戰的意義上自然不失重要的價值。在歷史上看，當元朝末年，明太祖朱元璋以一個手無一兵一卒的平民，在江，淮，徐，泗間稍稍揭竿而起，掛出聲討異族的招牌，不數年間，立刻把中國有史以來武功最盛的元朝顚覆了。他一半爲着個人的利益，一半也爲看民挨的自由。不過我們自這段歷史的反映中，可以明白安徽的民眾是具有傳統的反抗異埃壓迫的思想的。在淪陷區中，必不甘於屈服；在非淪陷中，必有英勇的貢獻。前幾天，剛有一位在詹中元師當參謀的友人從安徽回來，給記者帶了不少的興奮和安慰的消息。使我們知道了今天的安徵，已在不聲不息的寧靜中完成了許多抗戰的工作，爭取得許多勝利的條件。一面抗戰，一面建國，安徽正是這掛的無言奮們着。</p>
<p>安徵全省六十二縣，徽北津浦沿線的縣　雖被×人佔據，而皖南還多在我手中。安徽省政府所能統治的尙有五分之三以上。同時安徵正是丘陵地帶，地勢西甫高陡而東北低趨，我們的統治區對×人的佔據區恰取了一個居高臨下的控制優勢。在×人攻陷南京而不　擾懷寧，攻陷徐州而不淸除淮西，雖於兵力，和　事價值有關，但多少也受了地勢的限限。今天我們正利用這有利的地勢，予×人嚴重的打擊和威脅。</p>
<p>無疑地，自南京，徐州，九江淪陷了，安徽三面受着×人的包圍，但由於×人兵力的奇絀，早已不能台圍再進，遂給我們在腹部的×人建立起反攻的堅强根據地了。所以今天的安徽，十像一支挿向×人腹部的利劍，劍尖是合肥，劍柄是蘭谿而我們握劍的手，却從雲貴沿長沙，南昌成一條直線的伸出，只要我們的手愈見堅强，則這支的劍也愈爲有力。現在，我們努力的將這支刺早在×腹的劍日推日深，自然不久會看見『白刀子進去，紅刀子出來。』</p>
<p>據說：自去年十二月以來，這三四個月裏。安徽境內非常的沉寂，連×人的飛機都少發現。我們的隊伍扼拒於貴池一帶，×人經過武漢的會戰，喘息未定，固無犯皖的餘力，而我們的實現持久戰略，也沒有施行大規模的出擊，所以轉戰南潯，隴海線的丘兆琛，詹中元許多師勁旅，移駐其間，還沒有大顯身手，不無『髀肉生』之復感，爲了建立起反攻的根據地，軍事當局巳利用了寧靜的時機，在安徽盡量訓練和編立預備隊伍，增强未來出擊的力量。徽州附近的××××諸縣，有看不少四川，貴州的健兒們，每天在原對間高呼著口號，學習著操典的動作。川貴的健兒，富有沉毅而堅耐的特性，再灌輸以現在的軍事智慧，配合起來，足造成一支精銳的隊伍，在下期的抗戰中樹立起偉大的勞績。兵役工作安徵也做得很好，避役和逃亡的非常的少，每個師管區每期的徵兵，大致都能徵到百分之八九十以上，而且都是自動的應徵，所以從這兩點觀，察我們的兵源補充是絕無問題的。即使這一批戰士為民族作了英勇的犧性　會有第二批更英勇的踏戰士着未乾的血跡前進。</p>
<p>兵役成續的好，大部似基於安徽保甲制度的健全。安徽的保甲，是值得讀美的。無論窮鄉小甲，都已經嚴密的施行調查編組。因此逼近前線的皖北各縣，也屬秩序井然。尤其對于軍運代辦和搖役供應工作，別省本屬一件難題，但安徽有了保　的正確藍本，分配較極均勻，民眾樂於效力。於是行軍上獲得助力不少。無論長距離，短距離，每到一個鄉村，一個鄉村必誠懇的欵待協助。民眾愛護軍隊，軍隊固不忍騷擾民眾，而且將加意的保衛民眾，正是互助，合作的階梯。安徽的軍民已熱烈的握起手來。</p>
<p>雖在×人包圍之下，安徽和內地的交通一樣的便利。比方從徽州登程，坐幾點鐘公路汽車到蘭豁，可以轉乘火車通過南昌，分往粵桂川黔等省。境內的津浦，京蕪鐵路雖早失陷，但全省的六千幾公里的公路中，還有許多公里仍不斷的通車，溝通着情報，軍隊，經濟和文化。不過毗隣着×區的才澈底的施行破壞了。</p>
<p>安徽省會的徽州，在戰火中很苦的生長起來了。去年經×機的迭次轟炸，人口本疏散了一部，現在却又漸漸的熱鬧了。附帶值得一提的，安徽去年豐熟，農產品極平，物價與曲江比較，平達二倍，人民生活和軍隊給養有了絕對的把握，抗戰精神會更加的旺盛了。</p>
<p>×人境內的津浦路徐州至浦一段未通車，依然是一條『死』路。我們經常地甩正規隊伍率領了武裝的農民分佈在鉄路兩旁或開至京蚌一帶襲擊，×更恐慌，每次總有所獲，安徽的民間槍枝不多，所以還沒有像廣東的自衞團的設立，不過民眾的恣態都是勇敢强悍的。</p>
<p>安徽已像一支利劍，要一步步地挺上×人的腹心，×人的橫暴殘酷，遠勝過成吉斯汗的遺裔×人的武功遠不及蒙古　朗，江淮徐泗間的英雄紊傑們，不要忘記了明太祖的偉跡，起來和異挨的仇×拚命。</p>

<p>英西門財相</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦八日電】英財相西門、今日下午在下議院宣佈、中國政府、準備籌欵一千萬鎊、作爲鞏固其幣制之外匯平準基金、已有英銀行兩家、願代爲合籌五百萬鎊，餘欵則由中國政府銀行兩家負擔、該兩英銀行願爲籌欵、但須英財部擔保、英財部亦經允予擔保、現已起草提案、送由立法當局批准、據聞此次借欵之利息、特別低微云、</p>
<p>【本港消息】英國方面負責籌集五百萬英鎊者、爲匯豐銀行負責三百萬英鎊、麥加利銀行負責二百萬英鎊、中國方面則由中國銀行與交通銀行負責籌集、此一千萬英鎊外匯穩定金、由一管理委員會負分配之責、會址聞擬設於香港、委員包含兩英銀行及兩華銀行、另一委員則由中政府與英政府共同委定、但須取得匯豐銀行與麥加利銀行同意、此項基金之設立、目的在安定中國貨幣價格、防止法幣英鎊匯率之反常閃縮不定、調整外匯交易、此項外匯穩定金貸欵成立之後、中國政府之經濟與金融政策、將採取穩定法幣對英鎊匯　之價值、後此購買外匯、必須與管理委員會之銀行中之一交易、</p>
<p>中國銀行董事長宋子文談話　公佈中欵成立經過　深信中外商業同蒙其益</p>
<p>【本港消息】中國銀行董事畏宋子文氏、對於倫教宣佈之法幣平衡基金發表談話如下、</p>
<p>我國法幣自上年六月間起、卽己維持穩定、此次中國銀行交通銀行會同英方匯鹽銀行麥加利銀行、共同組成平衡基金、當使法幣之基礎、更臻鞏固、查上年三月十二日政府因特殊情勢、命令政府銀行、停止按法價無限制售出外匯辦法、另行公布申請外匯審核規則、實施之後、上海市面對英匯價睦續下降、至六月間竟達八便士左右、當時中國銀行、認爲法幣對外價值已屬貶抑過度、以國人對於法幣信仰之深、若果因軍政方面、有一時不利消息、致使市面衝動詩、　須本行决心維持、不難穩定、此項維持政策、經獲得政府之贊同、及中外同業之熱心協助、本行始從事于穩定外匯之工作、</p>
<p>以經過事實而言、本行所預測者、實非過當、在九江廣州漢口相繼陷落之時、雖感受投機者之威脅、而外匯市面、仍能維持其平衡、不獨此也、每當風潮平息之後、本行仍能將因維待法幣所售出之外匯、悉數睛回、</p>
<p>按我國今日國際收支狀况、實已無慮外匯準備金之流出、今復由中英兩國之重要銀行、共組平衡基金、以應付今後市面之一切衝動、而其撥出之資源、又數倍於中國銀行在過去期間內所運用之數額、無論中外商業、均極欽幸、蓋此於法幣之穩定、實有莫大關係焉、</p>
<p>英方負責人宣稱將續且我國　英政府重視其在華利益　此次借欵不啻對日警告</p>
<p>【中央社倫敦八日電】財相西門向下議院宣佈、英國銀行兩家協助中國政府設立兌平準基金之後、此間負責人士頃宣稱、此項基金設在倫敦、當與英國匯兌平準基金同其運用、英國支持中國法幣主要目標、厥在維護英國作華國務、并不以維護金鎊利益，此舉對於日本絕無不友好之處、日政府若果提出交涉、卽當予以釋答、囊者日本政府一再聲明必須以該國所認爲適當之方式、維護中國貨幣、英國政府亦亟願以本國所認爲適當之方式、維　中國幣價、英商務因貨幣價漲落而受損害、總之、英國此舉係在對華推行友好的中立的政策範圍以內、并非歧視日本，今後或當　以其他方法援助中國云、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦八日電】負責方面指出、中國以海關稅收爲抵押之借欵付息、迄末有延期不付之事、至於其他借款、中國亦均如期付息、中國雖在艱難困苦之中、兼之若干稅收旺盛地方、己淪他人之手、然猶極力維持信用、較諸若干國家、並無此種藉口、而蓄意抵賴者、相去遠矣、此次借欵維持中國幣制計劃、雖不能直接影響華北管理外匯一事、然此實爲向日方提出之警告、卽英政府决不坐視英國在華利益之飽受摧殘、而不加以實際上之援助也、並悉尙有多項積極辦法、正在攷慮中、曾有若干方面、不斷要求政府向日本採取報復手段、使其取銷英國在華利益之限制，日前倡議緩和政策者、今亦認爲唯有報復手段、方能獲得完滿之結果也、</p>

<p>— 宋美齡</p>
<p>……在渝紀念會致詞原文……</p>
<p>凡是有益于抗戰建國的工作，男子能擔當的、我們也要當仁不讓的祖當起來，尤其重要的、而且是多數女子都能做的、我以爲無過于安慰出征軍人家屬、和協助出征軍人家屬、我們要經常慰問前綫將士和陣亡將士的家族、、使他們精神上得到安慰、我們要扶助他們能够自立、醫如舉辦小工藝、組織合作社等等、使他們經濟和生活不發生困難、并且帮助他們解决子女教靑的問題、這樣出征軍人們沒有後顧之憂、一般同胞們、就可以踴躍應徵上前綫、我們兵役問題、有了順利推行的辦法、抗戰就一定勝利、國家就得到保陣、</p>
<p>我相信以我們女界的精神、對于抗戰、一定能貨獻很大的助力的、祇要看星期日女界獻金的成續、就可以使我們有確實的自信、女界獻金爲什麼能有這樣的成績呢、完全由于我們有組織、能團結、也有刻苦耐勞的精神、我們女界能够一致動員、不分彼此、把或多或少或大或小的力量、一齊實戲出來、　有這樣的成績、但我以爲、我們的工作多得很、不一定件件都要有表面顯著的成績、我們的工作、祇是發勸于我們愛國的天職和責在、我們應該不希望誇耀、不希望贊揚、也不需要鼓勵、而埋頭努力于更切實的工作、越是不求人知的工作、力量越是大，我們在艱苦寂寥的工作中、去做　名的英雄，不求個人的榮養、而以羣策羣力，求得國家民族的榮譽、這樣、我們必定能够從實際工作中、提高我們女子的地位、達到我們更崇高的目的、</p>
<p>各位同胞、我們這一次抗戰、是正義和暴力的戰爭、是民族存亡的關頭、亦是國家復興的序幕、我們現在應該一切不問、一切不顧、專心一致的、求得抗戰的勝利、我們要知道、正義公理是屬於我們的、世界上全人類的同情、是屬於我們的、我舉幾個例子來証明、</p>
<p>第一件、我提出給各位看、一件寶貴的贈品、這是一位印度女子、從她的身上解下來的、她說、「她對日本××殘暴、懷着極深的痛恨、對我們中國抗戰、起無限的同情、對我們中國女同胞努力抗騷工作、是萬分的感動，决沒有什麼可以表示、就把她僅有的財產，也是她身上一刻不離的飾物、解了下來、捐贈給中國、」我請各位看看，在這條環練上、是寄託着多少的深情、</p>
<p>第二件是我接到一位美國留目女童的來信、還附贈金圓一枚、她信上說她是一個不幸的女子、但她聽聞中國受×人蹂躪如此殘黠、中國男女兒童的痛苦、是這樣的深、她對於×人、對中國殘酷的行爲、都能了解、并不盲目、她覺得她再不應該埋怨不幸、她表示慚愧、她又表示對中國女同胞從事職抗的勇敢、感到無　的興奮、這一對信和來自萬　以外的一枚金圓、眞足使我們感動、</p>
<p>第三件是我發到另外一位外國女子一封信、她說她的未婚夫和朋友出游、不幸死了、她自己息着半身不遂的病症、但爲了正義入道觀念的驅使、對中日戰爭十分的關念、天天要看報、天天祝禱中國勝利、醫生怕她多受刺激、甚至不許她看報、她自己不能寫信、只好託她的朋友代寫一封信、希望我們中國同胞能持久努力、求得最後勝利、各位要知這、我近來所接到國外的來信、一天總有好幾封，</p>
<p>上面不過隨便舉幾個例子、我們看萬里以外的異國友人、尙且如此、我們卻是中華民族的女兒、更應該如何勉勵自已、鞭策自己來救起我們的國家、求得我們國家民族的解放呢、以我們自身的犧牲奮鬥、求得國家的解放和二萬幾千萬女同胞眞正的解放、我十分確信、是一定能達到我們的志願的、我願今天到會的女同胞們、立定决心、向前　鬥、爲世界婦女運動史上寫七最光榮的一貢、（完）</p>

<h3 id="c35">德國的大公路計劃 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 董平譯</p>
<p>—希特勒東進政策的又一暴露—</p>
<p>Roger　Shaw原奢。載「現代史料」二月號</p>
<p>去年十二月中的一個夜晚，柏林最大的民眾戲院裏，舉行着一個「同志娛樂會」；參加的是三千名築路工人，希特勒自己也親臨出席；元首的警察樂隊也到塲奏樂助興。情况的熱烈，不下於美國人的度耶誕節。</p>
<p>這三千名築路工人，是代表着一個非常重要的德國國家組織。它的任務是築汽車路。那晚的娛樂會，便是慶祝德國三千公里大公路網的完成與揭幕在表面上，築這個大公路網的目的，是在救濟德國失業人民；但實在的，那是一個純粹的軍事計劃。它跟古時羅馬帝國中的錯縱連橫的大道一樣，完全用以作迅速的軍運的。</p>
<p>設計這條大公路，是一個叫杜德的德國工程師。正對着法國馬奇諾防線的，德國萊茵區的新堡壘，也出自他的心血。</p>
<p>杜德的這個公路網，遠自北海平原，延到阿爾卑斯山麓，自工業繁盛的西區，仲到士地枯瘠的東方。在這條大公路上，沒有一個村莊，沒有一個念道、所以，行駛車子可以用最快的速度而沒有半點限制。</p>
<p>杜德的計劃，每年還要擴充一千公里。同時，在杜德的計劃之下，一個「國社黨汽車團」是組成了；這個「汽車團」，是具有極大的政治意義的；它跟褐衫的「衝鋒隊」與黑衫的「鉄衞軍」，同是國社黨的三大軍隊。</p>
<p>但是，德國的這個大公路計劃，可並不如此簡單。杜德和他的財政後台——林帝國銀行——現在正準備把這公路伸延到德國以外去。依照他們的新計劃，第一步先貸通德國最新的勝利品捷克；那麼，一條大路便可以自德國的西里西，自北而南，直達維也納。這樣，西里西及奧大利的駐軍，就可以在頃刻之間集中起來，循捷克的大道向東推進，以　波蘭或蘇維埃鳥克蘭。同樣的，這條南北大道對於德，奧的貿易，也是收獲非鮮的。</p>
<p>這條路，德國是準備獨資建築的，同樣，她也要全權管理的；甚至於在沿路的捷境中，德國還要享有治外法權，那簡直就是捷克境內「德國走廊」。德國商買人民在這走廊之中，是根本用不着護照，而不受捷克檢查的。</p>
<p>其實，這真不過是德國在捷克的大公路計劃的序幕，其餘的還在秘密設計之中。同時，捷克政府現在則計劃在國內，自西而東築一條大公路，一切磨用材料，都已準備，約計需要五萬到十萬的工人，工作五六年方　完成。但如果杜德一也加入帮忙的話，相信可以很快的完工的。</p>
<p>現在可以說得明白一點了，如果，這金部計劃完成之後，德國的大軍，便可以自西里西及維也納兩端，迅速沿「德國走廊」集中到捷克；然後再循捷克的公路，向東急馳；直達羅馬尼亞的邊境，羅馬尼亞產油最富，早爲國社黨所覬覦。自羅馬尼亞向東南伸展，便可達於黑海，及蘇維埃烏克蘭的重要海港奧達塞——一個國社黨的主要目標。再說得簡潔點、所有的公路都是直向着鳥克蘭的；那兒有的是豐富的麥和鑛及複雜的民情。</p>
<p>假使德，蘇發生戰爭，汽車是佔着很重要的位置；坦克，鐵甲車，卡車，指揮車，炮單及其他一切的車輛，都要大肆活動。德，蘇兩國的軍隊，都早見及于此，而在忙淸準備。步隊，炮隊及輜重隊，都積極在摩托化。</p>
<p>國社黨很明自，現代的戰神是摩托了；所以，整個的德國汽車工業，便適應軍事的需要，南昌把卡車與客車一律標準化了。所有的卡車全分作噸半，三噸及五噸三種。客車原有一百三十五種式樣，現在也限制成十五種了，全適合軍事用送的。機器脚踏車對於軍隊，也極重要，德國是在大量儲存着。</p>
<p>德國的摩托化部隊，現在有三師，約三萬人；最近還在招募一師。但，德國的騎兵，却只有一營，都是著名的東普　士騎兵的子孫，最近聽說，又在招募新的騎兵，準備用在東方的平原上。</p>
<p>德國目前的陸軍實力大約是這樣的：正規軍四十二師，但大炮隊很缺；奧軍六師，成績不大高明；，兩師精銳後備軍在東普魯士；另外的三十八師後備軍中，炮隊，官員及運輪，都差得很遠。這數目一共約一百萬人，但人單多，實力却不及一般所想像的好。這是因爲德國在一九三五年方開始自己訓練軍隊的原故。</p>
<p>但，如果德國眞的以「汽車團」向蘇維埃烏克蘭進攻起來，蘇聯的應付實力怎樣呢，</p>
<p>自然，蘇聯是抉不甘示弱的，現在也在積極準備反杜德的大計劃。莫斯科最著名的史太林慶及莫洛托夫廠，便是蘇聯製造汽車的中心，兩廠每年要出車二十萬輛，及價值七千萬美元的汽車零具部份。</p>
<p>現在，蘇維埃烏克蘭與滿洲之間，正在建築一條公路，這條路的建築，一般相信，實在是反攻希特勒計劃的一部。</p>
<p>世界上的汽車比賽，也見得多了。在不久的將來，汽車比賽將會以一個新的方式展開在我們眼前，在那要面，將决定歐洲的命運。</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>現代的戰爭，是立體的戰爭，亦是最殘酷的戰爭。進步的科學本身沒有罪惡，可咀咒的是錯用了科學的侵略國家。咀咒是弱者的呼聲，要消滅武力，畢竟還是要借用武力，要運用科學。</p>
<p>我們祖國，就是爲了反對侵略，消滅橫暴的武力而展開了神聖的民族解放鬥爭。盡管×人怎樣轟炸，毀滅：我們却在抗戰中磨練，新生。這個割時代的大戰，在我們廣大的領土上巳展開二十個月了。</p>
<p>在個陰林　的大氣流罩之下，記者亦接　參着觀的人羣，　上九龍半島酒店的一樓巡禮防空展覽會去。進人第一展覽室的第一個印象，就是巨輻的「炸彈暴炸距離五十尺的成力一的圖畫。教人聯想到炸彈下降那一剎那的可怕！這滋味，逃難到香港的同胞不少人已經嘗過！難道它會趕到香港來嗎？第二幅驚心動魄的圖書是「防空指導員當值圖」。那熊熊的火焰，炸後的斷樑頺壁，死傷遍地，教人聯想到這己是我們同胞今日普遍着的命運了！</p>
<p>室內有四個人的模型，除穿着防空與消毒的特製服裝外，還戴了防毒面具，孩子們旣好奇又懼怕地說鬼—鬼！鬼—是的，這是科學的「鬼」。要使前線的將士免受×人的毒氣所殺害，我們應該輸送大批的防毒面具，使他們變成了有抵抗能力的「鬼」。</p>
<p>有一個房間，是示範玻璃窗被震碎後如何用　屏封封閉窗門以杜毒氣的侵入。還陳列有全套的七樣救傷藥品，五元錢就可以買到。</p>
<p>家庭築造避難室的圖畫，好像在暗示參觀者趕快握起斧頭與鋸子來。此外，還有「中國式房屋改爲防空指導員崗位模型一，「避難壕模型」；「防毒窗門」　　等，都是科學化的設備。</p>
<p>進入第二室的第一個印象是比例尺六分當一尺的「救傷站模型」示範負傷者進站療治的過程，眞是有條不紊。招待員細細地對參觀者解釋，讓聽者伸出了舌頭，　嘆：「眞周到」可是這樣的情形還是不要發生好！」</p>
<p>有一具「毒氣閘模型」，好奇的，要親身體驗的，都　入去窘息了一下子跑出來。現在，它權當是遊戲的玩具。</p>
<p>「面具管理法」的一部份陳列有很多防毒面具，讓參觀者自由嘗試，亦像好玩般戴了「鬼臉」。互相笑謔了一番散聞。</p>
<p>此外，還有『民用面具』；『毒氣侵害身體一電表，』等，都可以給參觀者長了不少的常識。負責招待與解釋的，有中西的服務員。尤其是着了救護服裝的少女來得中莊嚴，活潑，動人，記者暗地裏說：要是囘到祖國去眞的實踐，豈不是更偉大更有意義！</p>
<p>在第一二室的門口，有幾位西婦在販　「　難室」鬧片，教人如何　置一個避難室。掏出一角錢　一張回來可就容易。要照樣築造，可　不是人人所能做得到。記者逗留了好久，知道主顧多數是洋人。那邊還有一則通告，叫人去參加防空委員會主辦的防空訓練班。爲了充實戰時常識，這個倒是必要。</p>
<p>中西的男女老幼，還有學校的學生集體來參觀眞是濟　極了。當記者踏出門口時，在擁入來的人羣中，有幾位沒有着襪子的婦人被擋駕了。她們知道來凑趣，知道來看點新奇，却疏忽了這裏是「半島酒店」的大廈，終於悵悵抱怨而歸。</p>
<p>在半島酒店對面曠地，還有戶外防空展覽，外面用布幕蓋搭起來。裏面築有一個眞的防空壕，很精緻，足足可容六人。記者鑽入去巡視一下。那一次又一次的警報，轟炸之聲，婦孺倉惶之狀……悲慘的往事，立刻闖進記憶的領域。這是「往事」麼？不！這還是祖國廣大同胞的生活課題—××××××××××，思念及此，眞是悲從中來！</p>
<p>聞今日下午三時半且在該酒店對面空地戶外展覽處，由消毒隊演習，屆時施放毒氣，各隊員迅赴肇事地點測勘，隨卽實施消毒工作，藉以增加參觀者實際的防空智識。如果下星期六日天氣睛朗，還將於下午在上述的空地實施撲救燃燒彈的演習。</p>
<p>「防空展覽會」—這究是有備無患呢？××××××××？</p>

<p>王毛阮劉胡聯請的茶會</p>
<p>【本報特寫】是一個輕鬆的集會——王曉籟，阮維楊，毛和源，劉慶萱，胡妤，五　聯名約請的茶會，蒞會的有新聞界，電影，戲劇界，和名流閨秀，眞果是濟濟一堂，熱鬧極了。</p>
<p>時鐘打過四下，香港大酒店樓頭，慚漸熱鬧起來了，因爲秩序還來開始，客廳中，做了各人的臨時交際塲，新聞界，電影界，名流各界。一界一界，界限分淸的圍壠起來無拘無管的談談笑笑。一會兒，影星胡蝶也和金素琴一塊兒簇擁着名流小姐來到了。</p>
<p>紅茶小啜，阮維揚起立致詞，謂介紹一位朋友給各位，這位朋友是誰，就是金素琴啊—現在請金小姐出來和各位見面，金素琴帶點羞意—笑咪咪地站起來，向座眾點點首，她柳葉般的眉兒，笑得更彎了。</p>
<p>繼着阮維揚把金氏這次來港的工作介紹出來，接着是歐陽予倩的演說，將他和金素琴認識的經過，和金氏對戲劇的認識的正確，以及對於改良舊劇的努力。繼着他談到金氏的演技，他認爲金氏唱工最好，動作，身材也都不錯啊！</p>
<p>在談話當中，王曉籟先生來了，少不了要說幾句話。跟着金素琴，陳孝威顧無爲等也起來說話，對舊劇改良運動都有一番發揮。在萬家燈火近黃昏的時候，才結束了這一個輕鬆的聚會！</p>

<p>話劇狂流在這個年頭，從國內向香港湧過來，眞是蓬勃一時。許多名劇都用着不同的國語，粵語，或英語先後演出，而許多都是為著籌欵賑濟傷兵難民，如果我們不能忘記表揚這一點的話，我們要說到今夕和明晚在聖保羅女書院演出的「前夜」。</p>
<p>「前夜」是名作家陽翰笙先生的傑作，是暴露天津淪陷前一班，漢奸的活動，和一般愛國靑年在堅苦中扎鬥爭的國防名劇。在此時此地論出，是有其重大的意義的。何祝它同時是聖保羅女書院和香港聯靑社合辦的義舉呢，</p>
<p>「前夜」在李穆龍指導之下，在該女書院試演過多次，劇中人完全是由該校學生和它的許多舊生挑選出來　任的。吳愛玲飾漢奸。白次山的太太（鄭文萱），戀愛著她的家庭教師，她誘引青年底手段和表情，以及嫉妬的表演，都是不錯。但最好的地方，還是她對愛人訴說身世時的凄怨嬌羞底態度！蘇曼娥飾漢奸的姪女白靑虹，佩蓮飾漢奸走狗劉濟成，一個卻機警慧智的做出她　父的敵手，一個却表現老奸巨滑足的漢奸舉動。李慧清飾白次山，宋漱琴飾林建平　均能做出逼眞底救亡責的氣慨。關於這一點，李穆龍先生和聖保羅胡校長表示着十分滿意，他們說，「從未認真出台做戲的人，能有如此表演，是難能可貴的，因爲他們都是女學生」。</p>
<p>爲了救亡戲劇運動，爲了救齊，流離顚沛的難民，我們顧意先在這里作一個義務宣傳，希望大家踴躍前來吧！</p>

<p>— 張問强</p>
<p>在抗戰時期，政府爲充實軍費，維護稅源固屬重要，但是，改善人民生活，以增强抗戰力量，也是當前的急務，况且目前豁免洋米進口稅，對政府的財政收入並無多大影響，原因是：外匯高漲，洋米成本高昂，再加以每相國幣三元多的進口稅，己使洋米價格高至難於進口，目前雖在照常徵收洋米稅，而因洋米進口數針極微，稅欵非常之少，汕頭爲洋來進口最多的一個口岸，但據統計，自今年一月一日起至二月廿六日止，將近兩個月的期間，潮梅需米正殷的時候，潮海關進口的洋米，合計不過四萬四千餘担，所牧米稅不過一十四萬餘元。由此觀之，我們可以說，目前洋米稅之征收，只能阻止洋米之進口，對於政府的財政收入並無多大的禆袖。</p>
<p>然而，也有人說，限制洋米進口，維持國內的米糧價格，卽所以維護農民的利益，此亦爲政府征收洋米進口稅的目的之一，此一見解，在平時是正確的。因爲洋米如果免稅進口，將大量傾銷中國，使國內各省過剩的米糧，不能運銷缺米的地區，致供過於求，使其價格低落，危害農民的利益。但在現在，在潮汕一隅，情形却大不相同：第一，國內產米之區的米，受×軍阻止，已無法運來潮汕，潮汕的米價高低與產米之區的農民絕少影響；第二，潮汕的農民所生產的米谷并不多，十部份的佃農及目耕農辛勤一年的的收穫，不足供自己的食用，有米谷出賣的只有極少數的富農與地主，米價高昂亦只有極少數的富農與地主得到利益。對于大多數谷米不够自給的農民是有害的。所以，洋米征稅，對于財政收入旣無多補，在民眾更增加了極大的負担，非但使人民生活困苦，且有米荒之虞，使民眾陷於有錢無米的恐慌狀態中，這對于潮汕人民的抗日戰爭是有極大的妨害的，因此，我們希望政府立卽豁免洋米稅！</p>
<p>豁免了洋米稅，使洋米得大量進口，固然可以防止米荒的到來，但是未必能够平抑米個以改善人民生活。民國廿六年與廿七年潮汕方面爲維持民食，平抑米價，曾請准政府豁免洋米進口稅斟酌人民的需求情形，限定一個洋米進口免稅的數量與時期。結果是米荒雖不曾發生，米價則仍然高昂，洋米免稅的利益，完全落入米商及一部份貪污之輩的私囊中</p>
<p>洋米免稅的本旨，一方面固在防止米荒，使民食充足，才能支持抗戰，另方面也在平抑米價，滅輕貧民負担，改善人民生活，以增强抗戰力量。但是，商人好利，而且善於牟利，與貪污的公務人員互相勾結，便把洋米免稅的利益全數巧取而去了。</p>
<p>因爲免稅洋米有數量與降日的限定，米商多在免稅期間大景囤積不售，存米雖多，亦覺求過於供，價俗高昂。到了免稅期限巳過，商人始將存米出售、其價格則等於有稅之洋米。所以，過去兩年的洋米免稅，民眾未得絲毫利益。</p>
<p>豁免洋米進口稅，主要目的固然在乎防止米荒，但是同時也要平抑米價，使廣大的民眾能够得到免稅利益，不應該讓政府損失的洋米稅，完全流入米商與貪污份子的私囊。過去兩年，汕市當局，爲防範商人操縱米價，曾組織過評價委員會，但是，評價委員會過於愛護米商的利益，所評定的價格，都比商人的售價更高。評價委會不但沒有限制米商的操縱米價，而且掩護了米商操縱的行爲，在未做到嚴密管理糧食以前，如果照過去的成例，限定數量與時期豁免米稅，無論什麼方法都不容易杜絕商人的作弊而得到平抑米價的效果，我們認爲局部地在潮汕豁免洋米稅，不應再有數量與時期的限定，使商人難於操縱，才能平抑米價，實惠貧民。在梅潮一隅，在抗戰時期，所患糧食不足，不惠糧食過剩，平日政府提倡儲糧，收效極微，縱使免稅洋米進口數量超過了當前人民的需要，在糧食生產不足的潮梅，多餘一恢糧食，應該是利多而弊少。在宣佈暫免洋米之後，政府可斟酌情形，到必要時才些復征稅。</p>
<p>解决潮汕的糧食問題，豁免洋米稅不過是目前治標的辦法，根本的辦法應該從增加生產着手。當此初春時節，應該發動廣泛的熱烈的春耕運動，鼓勵農民增加生產。</p>
<p>在潮汕發動春耕運動應該注意的第一是劇除鴉片，第二是開墾荒地，第三是改良耕法。潮汕方面有不少膏腴之田，目前所栽種的並不是稻麥及其他有益民生的農業作物，而是戕害人民的罌粟。揭　，豐順。普寧的偏僻鄉村就有不少的田畝正在長着繁茂的罌粟，而且農民種烟的比抗戰以前史多了了。在抗戰時期，爲應付×人的海洋封鎖，潮梅糧食自給的要求比平時實增加千百倍的迫切，而農民不但不能增加糧食的生產，反而減少生產，我們肅之惟恐不淸的鴉片，却比抗戰以前生產得更多了，這是一個矛盾而且痛心的現象！</p>
<p>饒乎，南山，豐順各處，還有不少可以闢爲良田的荒地，擴大春耕運動應該極力鼓勵農民墾荒，各縣局當局，應積極指導農民到荒地去開墾，並予以種種的便利與保障，使農民明瞭墾荒的意義，並能得到切實的利益，因而樂於從事墾荒工作。</p>
<p>潮汕的農民尙沿用千年相傳下來的舊方法去耕作，比之科學昌明的國家，我們的田地之生產量實還不如。雖然，我們不能學工業發達的國家，使農業機械化，但是，如何改良施肥的方法，如何淸除農作物的害虫等等普通的科學常識，灌輸給廣大的農民，也足以使農作物生長更好，結成更豐當的果實，增加收獲的數量。</p>
<p>抵抗敵人的進攻，糧食與子彈同樣重要。在敵人耽耽地窺伺潮汕的今日，解决潮汕的糧食問題，我們應該切切實實地努力做去！</p>

<p>好萊塢、這個地名有多少人在憧憬着呀、每一次有個新面孔在銀幕上發現、總有多少人在奇怪着、她—或他—是那裏來的呢、是怎樣跑進電影圈的呢、爲什麼自己就沒有這樣的機會呢、</p>
<p>靜靜心、把這裏一百零一條方法仔細看過一遍、我敢說、至少一定有一條適合你的、這許多方法之中、有的需要天才，有的需要胆量、而有的却完全靠運氣、揀你辦到的一條做去、誰敢斷言你將來一定不是位閃爍的明星呢、反過來說、也許這兒的方法只會打破了你做明星的夢想——僈說掃興話、先看了再說、</p>
<p>（一）穿上禮服、赴駐泊在聖也巴巴拉英國戰艦上的宴會、——第二天在卡塔林那醒來時、被裝在一家影片公司的船裏——對人說自己决心投身好萊塢——然後、當看一個在英國會會過一次的某導演的面、跳下汽車來——只要那位導演一高興、你就有試鏡頭之望了、台維尼文（David　Niven）就是這樣七了銀幕、</p>
<p>（二）在適當的時間內、在適當的地點、裝扮得很漂亮的進晚膳、文黛芭、（Wendy　Barrie）莎麗愛鸞（SallyEilers）和瑪琳奧莎麗文都是分別在倫敦，杜潑林、和好萊塢的咖啡座上被發現的、</p>
<p>（三）做个着名演員的子孫、瓊斐納和康絲登斐納姊妹、泰隆鮑華、小范朋克和達慮璧諾（Ida　Luplno）都是靠了這上面的助力、</p>
<p>（四）生長在意大利的工人家庭——未訓練就能歌唱得如一隻雲雀——對人誇耀自已的天才——由學校方面捐集了錢上好萊塢—在屈洛卡台羅得到一个星期日試唱的機會、萊尼林（LenfLynn）就這樣到手一張合同、</p>
<p>（五）學做鬼臉和怪聲、然後上好萊塢表演給人看、慮夫台維斯（Rufe　Davis）就是如此、</p>
<p>（六）兒時剛一學步、馬上學跳舞、祗要學得好、十五年至二十五年之後不怕沒人發見你、至少弗蕾亞斯祖、伊蓮諾鮑惠兒和奧琳白勃拉娜就是以此法成功的，</p>
<p>（七）做一个職業的滑稽角色、被影業中人個去在宴會裏歡娛賓客、芬斯巴奈脫（Vfnec　Barnett）就開頑笑開到銀幕上去了、</p>
<p>（八）發明一个奇形怪狀的樂器、在嘉年華會裏演奏八年、再在江湖遊藝班裏演奏八年、周巡美國四十八州、多聽些牆談巷語、然後拉長一副正經面孔、說給人家聽、鮑勃彭斯用這个方式賺了大錢、</p>
<p>（九）進一个學校、而學校內的劇社有時兼拍一些容易給製片家看到的業餘影劇、這就是製片家發見安特拉烈絲經過、</p>
<p>（十）做个電影女演員的姊妹，洛麗泰楊能踏上銀壞、就因爲她是寶萊安揚（Polly　Ann　Young）的妹妹、</p>
<p>（一一）認識一個女演員、而她是有勇氣把你介紹給一个編派演員人的、舉個例說，林卡佛（Lynne　Carver）是認識寶萊安楊的，</p>
<p>（一二）製造可用大字標題的新聞、做孿生五女之一、或是駕了飛機要往洛衫磯、反而在愛爾蘭降落之類</p>
<p>（一三）追隨一個著名影星到好萊塢、隨後嫁給他，伊蘭芭莉（Elafne　Barrie）追着嫁了約翰巴里摩亞、而現在她也是影界中人了、</p>
<p>（一四）做明星們不敢做的驚險把戲、你或者不能成爲一影星、但是有做影星的『替身』之望——像伊翁利特（Ione　Reed）那樣，</p>
<p>（一五）假使你從未演過戲、而被一个代理人誤認爲另一人、問你曾演過什麼戲時、不要躊躇、給他个很快的回答、快學學亞倫摩勃萊（Alan　Mowbray）、</p>
<p>(一六）握着世界溜冰錦標、到好萊塢去、假如沒人注意、不妨來一次表演、這是宋雅海妮的辦法、</p>
<p>（一七）長着一張半像羅拔泰勒、半像泰降鮑華的臉、李却格林成功了、</p>
<p>（一八）進演員養成學校、如果有人給你一個鏡頭試驗、不要跟別人一樣、要顯出冷淡視之態度、好讓他知道你不是好萊塢型的人、裘恩卡遜（June　CaRlson）便因此事變成了露茜瓊絲（Lucy　Jones）、</p>
<p>（一九）運用口才弄到一個編劇的職務、學一點「神秘一之秘訣、實地應用起來、希迪拉瑪便如此上了銀幕、一</p>
<p>（二〇）和一个戲劇教員結婚，克拉克蓋勃爾第一拉夫人——約瑟芬狄倫（Josephfne　Dfllon）、教他如何演戲、並且盡力鼓勵他試去拍電影、</p>
<p>（二一）先期做一个現在是好萊塢名人的舊友、賣克卡遜（Jack　Carson）由他的老朋友大導演奮治史提芬斯（George　Stevens）那兒得到了機會、</p>
<p>（二二）使你的歌唱天才在故鄉戲劇批許界裏雷下一个好印象、讓他們把你囀的歌喉灌成片子送到好萊塢、蘇珊拉遜（Susanne　Larson）之上好萊塢全由是她歌喉所介糾的、</p>
<p>（二三）學用一種怪　子、完全跟本人平日所用的不同、再弄一個木偶人坐在膝上、玩點小笑話、够了、七年之後好萊塢就會發現你如同發現愛茄倍根（EdgarBergen）一樣、</p>
<p>（二四）一直釘着一個尋天才演員的人、直到他給你一個鏡頭試驗才讓他脫身、像弗萊麥克茂萊、（這法子有點笨而且需要很好的耐性、不過假如對方比你更有耐性的的話、我敢說你要失敗了）、</p>
<p>（二五）在一條電影製片人來往最多的航線上、做個旅客機駕駛員、假如他們給你一點拍片的建議、馬上採取它、如約翰屈蘭脫（John　Trert）、</p>
<p>（二六）找一個戲劇指導人、担保你成功、而且可以在你成名以後冉收取學費、瑪麗惠爾遜（Marfe　Wilson）就找到一個、</p>
<p>（二七）是一個漂亮的體育記者，隨支如哥運動員到他們的春季訓練營去、有許多疲倦了的尋求演員的人、都在那兒休養的、這是維納利根（Ronald　Reagen的方式、</p>
<p>（二八）臉上有一些特異之點、像傑美杜侖的大鼻子、喬伊白郎的闊嘴巴，蒙蒙的翹嘴唇、</p>

<p>F　、散隊——關于散除、在平常看來、似乎不重要、事實上、我們　然要使學生養成有紀律化的習慣、和有終始的精神、必需要最小的事情、也能夠合乎規律、不能茍且了事、因爲散隊時、若無不定之儀式或良好之習慣時，學生們、必漸漸的就會養成了散漫、隨便、茍且等不良之習慣、所以散隊時、　並要有一定的儀式，及最後之精神，如軍隊裏之散隊、在未散隊之先、高呼口號、（這種口號係關干可以振發精神、加强意志的）、而在我們的體育課、也可以實行、不過在香港內、未知適應與否、還要加以考慮、如童子軍所慣用的、退後一步行舉手禮、或行禮後、向後轉、等、皆可任意採用、切不可在學生自由解散為要、現把我平日所慣用的兩憫習慣舉例如下、</p>
<p>（一）如在轉堂的時間、為保持學校的安靜，而不到影響於其他班級之授課、最好能夠原隊帶到課室裏準備受課、</p>

<p>— 魏飛</p>
<p>抗戰後的香港，大有人滿之患。所以很多商人業主們，都當這是難得的機會。</p>
<p>我到香港的時間雖然有限，然而搬房的次數却就不少，由尾房搬到頭房，頭房搬到中間房，光的搬到暗的，暗的搬到黑的，大的縮小，有窻變作無窗。要有書非開燈不行，晴天的止午還可勉强二三小時。空氣自然不好，衛生史談不到，但房東並不却管這些，房租由四元半加至　元二，五元二加至五元半，我想，倘若再要我多搬二次時，那麼，那麼只有搬到屋主的樓底去罷！</p>
<p>這樣的房間，沒有意，沒有陽光，也沒有奸的空氣，日間是　沉沉，夜間　是黑沉沉，煮飯時更烟得淚水連珠。報載肺病的數字底單位中，恐怕也要我來肩上一個。</p>
<p>在房裏旣不能自修，不如釗外邊散散步，但是，每當一踏進行人道，便茫然不知何處去好。尤其在九龍，旣沒有人書局，又沒有有公司，從這裏走到那裏，從那裏走到這裏，有家好像無家。彷徨，彷徨，香港確是熱鬧了，西裝的，長衫的，旗袍的，夾着手的，並有肩的，在那屬，穿穿挿插，馬路上，汽車，Bus單車……來來往往，店舖一天天多起來，應接不暇，那裏有糖果公司。洋服店，也有歐化十足的電影院，這路是多美麗啊！可是，近來却一天不如一天了，那裏有二個，五個——　宿街頭者。弄得凡俗了。</p>
<p>我恐慌，害怕自己將要在那裏佔一蓆地，然我鎭靜自己，明知白慌是沒用的，仍然在散步，在行着同，行着好像　流在海上，從朝行到午，從午行到晚，東逛逛，西走走，從佐敦道走到彌敦道，從彌敦道走到上海街，從這邊行到那邊，經過露宿救濟會，很多人在那裏候着，候着，預備候得安樂的一宿，我嘆息。經過間故衣店，貼滿了五光十色的紙條，都寫着，『收盤在即』，『被迫交鏽』，我沒决，我嘆息，我覺得自已的能力量只有　息，再行前看見許多人圍着一間半開的綢緞舖，仰着頭在望，走近一看，原來又是如此，大家正默讀着貼在壁上的三對白紙對聯：</p>
<p>『金錢勝公理人情遜　權』</p>
<p>『鍬舖風行予苦矣鞋金雨至爾歐哉』</p>
<p>『藉萬惡金錢不惜手段卑污甘作害羣之馬</p>
<p>乘一時機會只顧荷　腫漲居然利慾薰心』</p>
<p>『我看了也是沒法，還是只有嘆息。</p>

<p>— 郭尼迪</p>
<p>——通俗歌謠——</p>
<p>廿三日天氣淸，碧空萬里無片雲，名山大川都不表，單表一座蘭州城。蘭州地處甘肅境，四通八達大下聞，正當是日中午十二點正，大街上人來人往鬧盈盈，忽聽得嗚嗚鳴警戰鳴，又知討厭的×機到來臨，各家店舖從容不迫把牌門　，胆小的市民防空壕裏暫躱身，表軌軋軋聲隱隱，機身遠遠看得淸，一字人字分行列，整隊飛來氣騰騰。好比似秋大雁陣，好比似點水蜻蜓。試把指頭數一數，廿機不差半毫分，我國空軍早已有戒心，說時遲，那時快，升臨雲空候端正。機中坐的是一個碧血赤心的飛將軍。不待×機來身近，風馳電掣向前迎。霎那間，機關槍聲劈劈拍拍連連響，仿佛如除夕夜裏鞭炮鳴，鵲起鶻　逞技能，威風癝癝無與倫，一場惡戰就開展，驚天動地泣鬼神。敵機見有準備心慌張，立刻陣容還散亂紛紛。只得手忙脚亂來招架，困我重圍欲逃萬不能。愁雲密密風瑟瑟，日色無光宇宙昏。忽聽得轟隆一聲震山岳，一架敵機著火炸藥崩，黑煙彌漫不分明；從雲頭里一個筋斗直往下界沉，骨碌碌，骨碌碌，好比似斷綫風第儘翻身，葬送了櫻島　中夢里人，我機一見胆氣壯萬分，橫衝直撞不容情。敵機是士無鬭志將無勇，東奔西竄思逃生，又一刻，轟隆兩下如雷霆，兩架敵機亦遭覆轍化灰燼。形　頓時又一變；各敵機加足　率四方奔，我機奮勇　尾追擊，飛將軍個個笑盈盈，接二總三的敵機被擊中，墜落城東十里墩、這一次敵機共喪九架，世界報紙齊喧，諸公聽我結後文，這叫做「蘭州空戰獲大勝」。</p>

<p>— 阿棠</p>
<p>你生長在明媚的南國，你的家在綺麗的南島。你靈魂裏燃燒着熱帶的野火。你的丰儀却是一株瀟灑恬靜的棕櫚樹。</p>
<p>你是早已存在。你將水恆地存在，然而我在先並沒有注意你底存在。</p>
<p>但是我們終於　逅了。你對我凝視，你的眼睛微　憂悒，但同時是極端　柔；你的眼色是靜的，但同時是熱灼的，你對我凝視，可是我不注意你的存在。</p>
<p>你越過荒漠的遼關的莽原來了，你駐足在窗外的欄梢上，你停留在憲帷間，你掀起帳紗，鑽進我的髮髻裏。</p>
<p>從夢影中，我睜開惺忪的眸于，發覺了你的存在。但我矜持着，對你熱情的凝視，我投以冷淡的一瞥。</p>
<p>然而，嚴冬雪降，塞雪凍結了我的心，於是你越過荒漢遼廣的莽原來。</p>
<p>到了炎炙夏暑，火機的太陽燒灼了我的心，於是你又越過荒寞遼闊的莽原來了。</p>
<p>我倦怠欲死的時候，你帶來芬芳的花香，使我聞之蘇醒。</p>
<p>你跋涉長途，你忙碌着，不是爲了報酬或幸福。</p>
<p>你對我凝視，你的眼睛是　悒，但是極端的温柔，你的眼色是冷靜，但又極端的熱灼，你只管對我凝視，於是我的心兒起了怔忡。</p>
<p>你越過荒漠遼廣的莽原來的時候，我尙　然在夢中。你怕聲醒我的酣睡，於是默靜　　足在憲外的樹梢上，靜默地停留在鸞帷聞，輕輕地掀起帳幔又輕輕地　進我的髮變裏。</p>
<p>當冬的積雪凍結了我的心的時候，你給我以　情暖意，於是我感到春陽煥發，積雪融解，春又回到人間。</p>
<p>當夏陽燒灼了我的心的時候，你一陣輕薰，却又使我淸凉入髓。如浴淸泉。我不冉苦熱，不再煩燥。</p>
<p>我愛聽你的步履，我在夢裏仍追憶你的步履，因它是如此輕柔，又如此穩健。</p>
<p>我愛聽你的聲音，我在夢裏仍追憶你的聲音，因它是，如此懇切，如此温婉，如此低沉，我更愛你的微笑。我在夢裏更追憶你的微笑，因它是如此的眞誠，如此由衷：如此的柔情，又如此的無邪。</p>
<p>我愛你的眼睛，我在　裏更苦憶你的眼睛，因它是如此深情，如此懇摯，但又如此純潔。它告訴我你是一個高貴的靈魂：它叫我相到白潔無瑕的嬰兒；救我想到聖潔崇高的天使。</p>
<p>於是我需要你，我在你處得到　安，我要與你同化！</p>
<p>你越過荒漠遼廣的原野來吧！你下必徘徊，不要遲擬，不必駐在樹梢上或停留意惟間。來吧，隋進來，永遠停在我髪鬆　。</p>
<h3 id="c75">鄉紳 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>我們這兒地方上有着許許多多的鄉紳。這些鄉紳，正如動物學上的爬虫類，哺乳類，鳥類的各有它們的通性一樣，也自然有着他們的通性的，這就是：終年不做事，却舒暢住在那間設備很好的房子裏抽大烟，打牌，飲人參湯，而且，莫明其妙地凡官都總是他們的朋友，都同他相好。</p>
<p>響如，我就舉我們這兒一個頂有聲價的大鄉紳做一例子吧。</p>
<p>我們這個大鄉紳不是商人，他在鎭裏并沒有一間店號；也不是大地主，他家裏只耕了兩三担殼的田地；他固然有幾個兒子——是兩三個妻子生下來的，那些兒子也固然做了一些小小的『起碼官』，但他們的收入却還不够他們各自的揮霍；我們的大鄉紳自然也不是一個富翁，人們都知道他前一　的生活是很不好過的，而他自己呢，年輕時候旣然沒有出過南洋，中年時節也不曾經營過什麼像樣的生意；總之，我們的大鄉紳就是這樣一個人：旣不是富翁，似乎也不大有什麼入息。</p>
<p>然而，說起未來免確有點類於神話的了——這事實，眞是有誰信得過的呢？</p>
<p>我們的大鄉紳却住在一間精緻華麗大寬大異常的房</p>
<p>子裏。他是很少到什麼街上去逛逛的，他幾乎整日整夜地停留在他的房子裏忙碌着許多瑣屑的事體，他要招待過往的或是地方上的官吏——目然，那些筵席都是珍貴的，豐美的而且花樣新鮮的，因此，他和許多官吏相熟了，他們往往在烟床上臥上了那麼的大半天商量着許多我們永遠不知曉的事情。</p>
<p>他的心地又是最爲慈悲博愛的，他雖然沒有加入耶蘇教會，却學着了耶蘇的塼愛精神，他時常接見許多陌生的面帶戚容的人們，而且總是那麼「義不容辭」的要替他們担下了弭　的担子，譬如說有一次一個婦人找到了他，告訴他警察局把她一個親屬抓去了。</p>
<p>「她其實不是私娟——她那裏是呢？」</p>
<p>「唔……唔……」我們的鄉紳點點頭，他是了然的，「那是要罰上好幾十元了的呀」！</p>
<p>「但總要……」婦人直爽地說着，『那一切我是曉得的』。</p>
<p>『——那就有辦法了』鄉紳搖了個電話給警察局長『那是我的親戚啊，她不是私媚——眞是豈有此理，那個說她是私娼的呢？』</p>
<p>於是那個私娼就又搖搖擺　的走到街頭來了。</p>
<p>又有一次，有一個人央求他帮忙土地的事情。</p>
<p>『那寔在是我的土地呀，但他一口咬定說是他的，他要霸佔了去。』那個人這樣敘述着。</p>
<p>鄉紳一言不語，他胸中立刻我有了辦法了。</p>
<p>『你那地方值……』鄉紳計算着那愧地價，於是說，『這樣好了，我管你沒事，你拿給我交涉費……』</p>
<p>那地方自然沒事了。</p>
<p>再有一次是這樣——我還想舉一件例子；一個征着了兵的靑年人這樣哀求他：</p>
<p>『鄉長說要我六十元，我那拿得出那許多呢，我雖有二十元，……』</p>
<p>鄉紳收下了靑年的二十元，於是靑年沒事了，我們的　紳寔在是這樣的一個好人。</p>
<p>他莫可拒抗的勢力還可以從他的房子的潭號上看出來——「租界」。什麼叫做租界，走過上海的人自然知這的，就是：政府的權力及不到的地方，我們的鄉紳的房子確實如此。，如說我們的政府是禁烟禁賭的，違法的一經抓住了總得要罰上一大筆款子方得脫身。但在我們的鄉紳的房子裏，却像始終不曾知道有這麼一條禁令一樣。每天，每天各種各樣的人們盡像趕集般的鑽到他的大門裏來。他的房子自然是寬大的，但這一來也顯得是異常狹隘的了，人們擠擁着，就像在市集裏一樣，番攤股子，荷蘭牌，紙牌，麻省，頂上精桃烟膏，……這一切把人們的腦筋都弄得有點量眩起來了，但他們却是寬心的，他們不必一壁躭憂着警察局的偵緝隊，因爲那裏是『租界』呀，而且，角落裏那個『擺莊』的不正就是局長嗎？</p>
<p>但不能因此就說我們那個大鄉紳是不愛國的，絕劉不能，他實在是非常愛國的，他雖然很罕得看一看那份定閱的報紙——他幾乎是從來不看書報的，因爲那上面有着過多他不認得的字，但他却常常關心國事，也買了五元的救國公債，而且，他還是，彷彿是自衞團什麼的委員呢！</p>

<p>不過，在成功與失耽之間，還存在着許多可以想到的問題；這些間題，使他有所躊躇。比方：如果他還未到那姑娘的家庭以前，被偵探發覺了他的秘密，是悄悄地自殺呢？還是勇敢地决鬥呢？如果那從未受過驚嚇的姑娘，一見他的手槍昏倒了，失了知覺，是拖走她呢？還是喚醒她再走呢？如果一切都很順利，祇有在臨行的時候，她家的護勇堵住去路。以手槍指着他說：</p>
<p>『嘰，你要是够朋友，請你把我們的小姐留下，我也一定購交情，給你讓開路……』</p>
<p>這時候，他該走入怎樣一種境地？扮起怎樣一種不可想像的角色？如果……最後，他把一切的雞題，都交給了他的手槍；他相信它是可以解决一切的。不過，以不傷害她爲原則，因爲祇要有她，便永有這一工作的對象；卽使他犧牲了，以後，還可以有代替他工作的同志。（二）</p>

<h3 id="e1">New British Loan to China Established <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The new British loan to China has been officially established. This matter is not only of utmost importance to the relationship between China and Britain, but also will have a significant impact on the future of China's war of resistance, on the situation in the Far East and the world. This is something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Since the full-scale war of resistance began, our government has made great efforts to maintain national credit, stabilize the value of legal tender, protect the interests of friendly nations in China, and strengthen the power to resist the war and build the nation. For twenty months, we have struggled arduously, and finally won international praise and sympathy. Recently, in order to further stabilize legal tender, our Ministry of Finance raised a loan of 10 million pounds. Half of it was undertaken by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, and the other half was borrowed from Britain. The British government, recognizing that stabilizing the value of Chinese currency is of utmost importance for the maintenance of commercial and other rights and interests in China, and coupled with the unanimous sympathy and calls from the people at home and those involved in Sino-British industrial and commercial affairs, finally made it happen. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the House of Commons the other day (the 8th) that the plan to stabilize China's currency system had been successfully completed. The British side's loan of 5 million pounds was jointly lent by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China. The British Treasury will guarantee the two banks. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also announced that this fund will be managed by a joint Sino-British management committee, with a total of five members. In addition to two representatives from each of China and Britain, the fifth member will be appointed by the British government with the consent of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The success of this loan from Britain to China is, of course, very important in terms of finance and economy. First, it proves that in the twenty months since the start of China's heroic resistance, the financial and economic situation has not only not been in a precarious state, as Japan has claimed, but that the foundation has become increasingly solid and the future is becoming more optimistic. This situation has been unanimously recognized and supported by Britain. Second, it is sufficient to further consolidate the foundation of China's legal tender. At the same time, Chinese and foreign businesses will benefit from it. As Mr. T.V. Soong said yesterday, "Our country's current international balance of payments situation is actually free from worries about the outflow of foreign exchange reserves. Now, the important banks of China and Britain are jointly forming an equalization fund to cope with all future market actions, and the resources allocated are several times the amount used by the Bank of China in the past. Both Chinese and foreign businesses are extremely fortunate. This is of great importance to the stability of legal tender." Third, and especially worthy of attention, is that it is sufficient to strike a blow against Japan's recent conspiracy regarding the currency of the occupied areas. The puppet governments in North and Central China had previously announced that starting today (March 10), the use of China's legal tender would be prohibited. The Sino-British announcement of the success of the new Sino-British loan and the establishment of a foreign exchange equalization fund on the previous day is, of course, a major blow to Japan's conspiracy. Fourth, there are also great benefits for Britain, because as a result of the development of Japan's military invasion of China, British interests in China have been greatly damaged. Recently, British businesses in Tianjin in North China, Shanghai in Central China, and Hong Kong in South China have been particularly severely hit by the Japanese. In order to break this bad situation and protect its legitimate rights and interests, Britain has no choice but to actively strike against Japan. Today's move by the British government can be said to be the first step in active action.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the political aspect, it is actually even more worthy of attention. First, it proves that Britain has realized the strength of China's resistance since the start of the war, and that only by actively assisting China can it maintain its interests in the Far East. As our Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mr. Quo Tai-chi, said yesterday (the 9th), "This move by the British government is sufficient to prove that the Chinese government has strong and firm financial and administrative power. Britain's cooperation with China at this time demonstrates that the Western countries have understood that the best way to maintain their own and Far Eastern interests is to do their best to provide legitimate assistance to China." Second, it proves that our insistence on united resistance will inevitably gain increasing international trust and assistance, a situation that is exactly the opposite of Japan's, which becomes increasingly dangerous in its international position as it fights more and more. Therefore, the diplomatic community believes that "the success of the new Sino-British loan will make the Chinese people feel extremely gratified, because not only has China received material assistance, but it is also deeply aware that this move is sufficient to protect the rights and interests of both China and Britain and promote the friendship between China and Britain." Third, the establishment of the new Sino-British loan can become a great driving force for the movement of democratic and peaceful countries to aid China and contain Japan. It goes without saying that the Soviet Union will thereby gain further convenience in assisting our country, and there will also be important developments in the material aid movement of the United States and France. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 9th stated that "Political circles believe that this move by Britain is related to the recent US loan of 25 million to China, and said that the United States and Britain are prepared to take the same steps to provide financial assistance to China." A dispatch from Paris on the same day also stated: "Although the French government does not want to announce a loan to China, it will sell automobiles to China in the form of credit loans. It is also reported that many French industrialists have set off from France to inspect China regarding the Yunnan-Burma Railway, and the French are in contact with Britain to jointly invest in construction." This is fresh proof.</p>
<p>We express our infinite joy and expectation regarding the establishment of the new Sino-British loan, the future of friendship between China and Britain, the future of the international movement to aid China and contain Japan, and the future of our country's war of resistance! We can also use this new fact to shatter all pessimistic and despairing views on the war of resistance, and the defeatist arguments of those who despise the power of the peace front and advocate a ceasefire and surrender! However, we still cannot but call the attention of all parties to the following points: namely, first, the establishment of the new Sino-British loan is only the first step in Britain's adoption of active actions to aid China and contain Japan. We must not only continue to work hard to promote this active action by Britain and other democratic and peaceful countries, but we must also strive to clear away the compromising and mediating conspiracies that hinder this action. Second, the decisive manifestation of this active step by Britain is driven by two main forces: one is the hope for the future of China's insistence on united resistance, and the other is the unanimous opposition of the British people to concessions, calling for aid to China and containment of Japan, and defending rights and interests in the Far East. Therefore, on the one hand, we must intensify internal unity and persist in resistance to the end, so as not to disappoint international friends, and on the other hand, we must further strive to unite and develop the international anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement. Third, our war of resistance and national construction must be under the principle of "self-reliance" to strive for the most foreign aid, but it is definitely not what pro-Japanese traitors and defeatists call for relying on foreign aid. At this time when the international situation is rapidly turning in our favor, we must intensify domestic unity and political progress, and intensify the concentration of all the living forces of the country on the front of the war of resistance and national construction, because only the general mobilization of the living forces of the country can guarantee the final success of the war of resistance and national construction, and can guarantee the more extensive and lasting international assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Worthless Puppet Currency in North China, Trade Declines in Tianjin, Beijing and Qingdao <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Correspondent's Report] Foreign newspapers here report that American businessmen traveling to Beijing, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other northern ports said in Shanghai yesterday (28th) that because of exchange rate restrictions, trade in North China has shrunk to a barter basis, and even this trade is minimal. The new regulations strictly enforced by the Japanese authorities, which require all remittances to be handled through Yokohama Specie Bank and force people to use puppet currency, have brought exports to a standstill. If imports are banned for a long time, exports will suffer equally. Import and export businesses in Tianjin and Yantai are trying to use barter, that is, extending credit for exports in exchange for import drafts. Of course, this method cannot completely offset the loss from exchange rates, but it can minimize the loss. Merchants in North China believe that even this barter system will be allowed by the Japanese authorities to continue for a long time. Dalian's exports are dominated by farmers' agricultural products, but since the Japanese army occupied the area, agricultural activity has been drastically reduced. According to a person who has lived in North China for many years, farmers have indeed abandoned their fields in recent months and moved to the interior or cities. There are many abandoned fields in the countryside of North China. Judging from the state of the mountains and fields, farmers are clearly not preparing for spring plowing. This has two effects. First, the Japanese army destroys villages and seizes property for military purposes or in retaliation against guerrilla teams, so farmers are no longer concerned about the land. The second, which is also quite important, is that a large number of farmers, adopting a scorched earth policy, leave their homes and move elsewhere, leaving behind abandoned fields as a reward for the invaders. The Japanese military authorities have banned the export of many goods that could be used for military purposes, making commerce almost completely stagnant for Chinese merchants. The implementation of commercial restrictions has instead caused them to focus on land, because most Chinese merchants feel uneasy about holding cash and are eager to convert cash into property as soon as possible. They have absolutely no trust in the "Federal Reserve Bank" and its puppet currency, and although they occasionally use it, it is only because they are forced to do so under certain circumstances. Most of the Chinese merchants I have contacted are willing to exchange the puppet currency for legal tender at a 60% discount, and I believe they are willing to exchange it for foreign currency at a 40% discount. On this point, I can speak from my own experience. No matter what ratio the Japanese authorities set for exchanging puppet currency for foreign currency, they will never succeed. I have tried to exchange puppet currency for foreign currency, and even the "Federal Reserve Bank" itself is unwilling to accept its puppet currency. After considering all these factors, it is easy to be optimistic about the future of foreign trade in North China. When asked if he had seen signs of guerrilla activity during his trip to North China, the American businessman replied that the Japanese officers in Tianjin were very fearful and uneasy. Two weeks ago, the Japanese army sent out a patrol of 25 soldiers to investigate the location of the guerrillas, but they never returned. Two days later, another 50 soldiers were sent out, but they also did not return to camp. Therefore, the Japanese army did not dare to leave Tianjin a single step. Although there are Japanese troops guarding the villages and towns near Tianjin and Yantai during the day, they all return to the headquarters at night and do not dare to go out until dawn. Along the Tianjin-Beijing railway, I saw a bridge that was being repaired. Others told me that the bridge had been destroyed by guerrillas a week ago. Although I traveled around the north and did not personally witness any fighting, one night while staying in a hotel in Beijing, I was shaken by the sound of heavy artillery fire, which did not stop all night. The next day, the Japanese authorities claimed that the artillery fire was a shooting exercise, but according to foreigners in Beijing, there had been fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies nearby. As for Dalian, a once prosperous city, it is now completely in decline. Seeing its condition is disappointing. I was quite surprised by the state of Dalian. When I left the United States for China, I still saw a book sent by the Manchurian "authorities" with photos of the prosperity of Dalian. The North China correspondent reported in the North-China Daily News Tianjin that, that here the monetary situation has not changed, but the conditions in Beijing and Tianjin are very different. In Beijing, because there are no concessions, the Japanese can forcibly enforce the punishment regulations for using legal tender. As a result, the banknotes of the puppet government are seeing premiums. In Tianjin, puppet currency must be discounted before it can be used, and the discount is about equal to the premium in Beijing. Last November and December, there was a severe shortage of ten-yuan and five-yuan legal tender notes in Tianjin, but this is no longer a problem. Puppet currency is rarely seen in the concessions. The Japanese authorities had previously complained that British and American banks did not recognize puppet currency as legal tender. What is strange is that the German and Italian banks in Tianjin, which have very friendly relations with Japan through the Anti-Comintern Pact, also follow the example of British and American banks and refuse to use puppet currency. This shows that this puppet currency is not trusted by people. How can Japan's national education create such rigid minds in its people, but the tragic life of war will eventually make their minds clear. No matter how high the deceptive techniques of the Japanese ×-clique are, our preferential treatment of prisoners of war and the long-term nature of the war will eventually be completely exposed. The following translation and photograph of an anti-war declaration are the true evidence of Japanese soldiers' anti-war sentiments, and there will be no more doubts in the future.</p>
<p>To All Soldiers:</p>
<p>Why are you fighting? Why are you dying because of the war? These are all deceptive tricks of some tyrannical departments.</p>
<p>The wives and children of the war dead often feel life is difficult and have become beggars!</p>
<p>The financial cliques do not give a penny of condolence money, and Konoe has not even written a single condolence letter.</p>
<p>A dou of rice has risen in price to five and a half yuan, a preserved plum has risen in price to three cents, and a salted fish has risen in price to thirty cents. Our families have fallen into this kind of hardship. This is the military's so-called reform of the Japanese spirit and politics!</p>
<p>The coal in Shandong has been monopolized by the Okura Company, textiles by the Mitsui Company, and salt, alkali powder, and cement by the Mitsubishi Company. Manchuria is the world of Ayukawa alone. The Mitsui Company monopolizes the kerosene and commerce in Shanghai, and the Mitsubishi Company monopolizes the warehouse and transportation industries.</p>
<p>Look, on the battlefield where the blood has not yet dried, the military and the financial cliques are combined to divide the profits. Is this the military's proclamation of national prestige?</p>
<p>The Chinese people must persevere in their resistance with a determination to die!</p>
<p>If we retreat, then the ambitions of the × Pass and the financial cliques will have no way to be realized!</p>
<p>If we stop the war, the lives of the whole country can improve!</p>

<h3 id="e3">Ironclad Proof of × Soldiers' Anti-War Sentiments - Special Correspondent Geng Jianbai <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Xi'an] The signs of the collapse of the Japanese × clique have already appeared! After these twenty months of long-term war, the Japanese domestic economic stagnation, resource exhaustion, continued trade deficits, financial constraints, troop losses, deterioration of international relations, and the war's lack of an end, the occupied areas cannot be controlled, and our forces of resistance are growing stronger and stronger. As a result, there has been a widespread sense of unease throughout the country, such as worker strikes, peasant riots, and anti-war movements among the people and soldiers. These are all obvious facts of the so-called "omens" mentioned above, especially this kind of anti-war narrative, which will be a key factor directly contributing to the total collapse of the Japanese × clique.</p>
<p>The bloody Hiranuma cabinet, which is attracting worldwide attention, has all kinds of effective remedies. However, it must first intensify the war of aggression against China to save the end of the × clique. Rather, it must first strengthen the exploitation of its own people to save its hopeless war of aggression against China. Although we cannot yet say that a revolution will break out in Japan because of this, there is no doubt that the anti-war movement of the Japanese people and soldiers will expand further and gradually approach revolution.</p>
<p>In terms of the structure of the Japanese national economy, the anti-war movement will inevitably become more widespread. Japan's industrial development is deformed, that is, capital is concentrated while production is scattered. Small and medium-sized enterprises account for a very important part of urban industry. Only the large capitalist class that operates military-related industries can enjoy the benefits of war. These small and medium-sized entrepreneurs are easily bankrupted by national control and the shadow of war. The unemployment of a large group of workers is inevitable. Small and medium-sized merchants are bound to suffer losses due to the decline in domestic purchasing power. In the rural economy, feudal landlords hold large amounts of land, and production is not capitalist. Therefore, small farmers and tenant farmers still occupy a very important position in rural production. After suffering all kinds of blows from the war, the life of toil that they have led all their lives will be further reduced. May I ask, will the Japanese peasant masses forever maintain a laissez-faire attitude toward the war and allow themselves to starve to death in vain? Their anti-war trend can be said to be inevitable.</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers who participated in the war of aggression mostly come from the countryside, and some come from the children of workers and small and medium-sized merchants in the cities. They and their families are the first to suffer the scourge of war, and they suffer the most. Their parents, brothers, wives, and children struggle on the line of hunger every day. They themselves are wounded, disabled, killed in action, and captured, and the war has no purpose or end. Under these circumstances, what will they feel? They are all human beings. They must not be able to persist in the war, and naturally they will tend to oppose the war.</p>
<p>Among the Japanese people and soldiers, there are naturally progressive elements with foresight, who led the anti-war movement at the beginning of the war. A year ago, we found anti-war leaflets from Japanese soldiers in the war zone. However, at that time, the general Japanese people and soldiers, under the deception of the Japanese × clique, had not yet deeply tasted the evil consequences of the war and had not generally awakened. The activities of anti-war elements had not been able to penetrate the masses. At the same time, the Japanese × clique's surveillance was extremely strict, and their activities were not easy to spread. After more than a year of this tragic war, their activities have gradually gained favorable conditions, so the anti-war movement has become increasingly widespread and in-depth. Recently, on the Shanxi battlefield, we have often found anti-war leaflets. Recently, eleven leaflets that had not yet been distributed were found on a prisoner in Jixian County, western Shanxi. The leaflets were printed by lithography, the paper was extremely thin, the handwriting was neat, and the printing was clear, which shows that their technology is quite advanced and their plans are quite comprehensive.</p>
<p>Some people often express doubts about the records of × soldiers' anti-war sentiments in newspapers. They believe that Japanese soldiers have learned a long-term national education containing toxins, and will not easily waver in their war of aggression against China. Moreover, under the strict surveillance and deception of their × clique, anti-war activities are not easy to carry out. However, precisely because of this, the occurrence of this kind of anti-war movement is even more meaningful. No</p>
<h3 id="e4">Anhui in Rapid Progress <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After the Nanjing and Xuzhou campaigns, Anhui has emerged from extreme tension into sudden tranquility. Although Anhui is not the central area of the war, it naturally retains important value in the overall War of Resistance. Historically, at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, the Ming Emperor Taizu, started as a commoner without a single soldier, raising the banner of condemning foreign tribes in the area between Jiang, Huai, Xu, and Si. Within a few years, he overthrew the Yuan Dynasty, which had the most powerful military force in Chinese history. He did so partly for personal gain and partly for the freedom of the people. However, reflecting on this part of history, we can understand that the people of Anhui have a traditional spirit of resistance against foreign oppression. In the occupied areas, they will never willingly submit; in the non-occupied areas, they will surely make heroic contributions. A few days ago, a friend who was a staff officer in General Zhan Zhongyuan's division returned from Anhui, bringing the reporter much exciting and comforting news. He told us that today's Anhui has quietly completed much anti-Japanese work and secured many conditions for victory. Resisting the enemy while building the nation, Anhui is silently striving in this way.</p>
<p>Of the 62 counties in Anhui Province, those along the Jinpu Railway in northern Anhui are occupied by the enemy, but most of southern Anhui is still in our hands. The Anhui Provincial Government is still able to govern more than three-fifths of the province. At the same time, Anhui is a hilly area, with high and steep terrain in the west and low terrain trending towards the northeast. Our controlled areas have a commanding advantage over the enemy-occupied areas. The enemy's failure to disturb Huaining after capturing Nanjing, and the failure to clear Huaixi after capturing Xuzhou, are related to military strength and strategic value, but are also limited by the terrain to some extent. Today, we are taking advantage of this favorable terrain to inflict serious blows and threats on the enemy.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, since Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Jiujiang fell, Anhui has been surrounded by the enemy on three sides. However, due to the enemy's stretched forces, they have long been unable to advance further, allowing us to establish strong bases for counter-offensive in the enemy's rear. Therefore, today's Anhui is like a sharp sword inserted into the enemy's abdomen, with Hefei as the tip and Lanxi as the hilt. Our hand holding the sword extends from Yunnan and Guizhou along Changsha and Nanchang in a straight line. The stronger our hand becomes, the more powerful this sword will be. Now, we are striving to push this sword deeper and deeper into the enemy's abdomen, and soon we will see "the white blade goes in, the red blade comes out."</p>
<p>It is said that in the past three or four months since last December, Anhui has been very quiet, and even enemy planes have rarely been seen. Our troops are holding the line in the Guichi area. The enemy, after the Battle of Wuhan, is still catching their breath and has no extra strength to invade Anhui. Our implementation of the strategy of protracted war also does not involve large-scale offensives, so many elite troops of Qiu Zhaochen, Zhan Zhongyuan, and others, who fought on the Nanchang-Xunyang and Longhai lines, have been stationed there without showing their full potential, inevitably feeling a sense of "fat thighs." In order to establish a base for counter-offensive, the military authorities have taken advantage of the quiet period to train and organize reserve forces in Anhui as much as possible, increasing the strength for future offensives. Near Huizhou, there are many strong soldiers from Sichuan and Guizhou who shout slogans and learn the movements of the drill manuals every day in the training grounds. The soldiers from Sichuan and Guizhou are known for their fortitude and perseverance. Combined with modern military knowledge, they can form an elite force to establish great achievements in the next phase of the War of Resistance. Anhui is also doing a good job in conscription. There are very few cases of draft evasion or desertion. Each conscription district can generally recruit more than 80% or 90% of the required number, and they are all volunteering. Therefore, from these two points, we can see that there is absolutely no problem with our troop replenishment. Even if this group of soldiers makes heroic sacrifices for the nation, a second group of even more heroic soldiers will advance on their un-dried bloodstains.</p>
<p>The success of conscription is largely based on the soundness of Anhui's baojia system. Anhui's baojia system is worthy of praise. Whether in poor and remote villages, thorough investigations and organization have been strictly implemented. Therefore, even the counties in northern Anhui close to the front line are orderly. In particular, the work of military transportation and supply, which is a difficult problem in other provinces, has a correct blueprint in Anhui's baojia system. The distribution is relatively even, and the people are happy to serve. As a result, the military has received a lot of help on the march. Regardless of long or short distances, every village they arrive at sincerely treats and assists them. The people cherish the army, and the army naturally cannot bear to harass the people, and will carefully protect them. It is a ladder of mutual assistance and cooperation. The military and civilians of Anhui have warmly joined hands.</p>
<p>Even under the enemy's encirclement, transportation between Anhui and the interior is still convenient. For example, departing from Huizhou, after a few hours by highway bus to Lanxi, one can transfer to a train through Nanchang to various provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou. Although the Jinpu and Jingwu Railways in the province have long been lost, many kilometers of the province's six thousand kilometers of highways are still open to traffic, communicating information, troops, economy, and culture. However, those adjacent to the occupied areas have been thoroughly destroyed.</p>
<p>Huizhou, the capital of Anhui Province, has grown up painfully in the flames of war. After repeated bombings by enemy planes last year, part of the population was evacuated, but now it is gradually becoming lively again. It is worth mentioning that Anhui had a bumper harvest last year, agricultural products are extremely cheap, and prices are twice as low as in Qujiang. The people's livelihood and military supplies are absolutely guaranteed, and the spirit of resistance will be even stronger.</p>
<p>The Xuzhou-Pukou section of the Jinpu Railway in the enemy-occupied area is still a "dead" road, not open to traffic. We often send regular troops leading armed peasants to distribute themselves on both sides of the railway or open up attacks near Jingbeng, causing the enemy even more panic. Each time there are gains. There are not many civilian firearms in Anhui, so there is no establishment of self-defense corps like in Guangdong, but the people's attitudes are brave and strong.</p>
<p>Anhui is like a sharp sword, about to steadily thrust into the enemy's heart. The enemy's tyranny and cruelty far surpass the descendants of Genghis Khan. The enemy's military power is far inferior to the Mongolians. Heroes and talents in the Jiang, Huai, Xu, and Si area, do not forget the great achievements of the Ming Emperor Taizu, rise up and desperately fight against the foreign aggressors.</p>

<h3 id="e5">British Chancellor of the Exchequer Announces Establishment of New Sino-British Loan in the House of Commons; Totaling £5 Million for Exchange Equalization; Sino-British Banks to Jointly Manage the Fund <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the Chinese government is preparing to raise £10 million as a foreign exchange equalization fund to strengthen its currency system. Two British banks are willing to jointly raise £5 million on behalf of the Chinese government, with the remaining funds to be borne by two Chinese government banks. The two British banks are willing to raise the funds, but require a guarantee from the British Treasury, which has been granted. A proposal has been drafted and submitted to the legislature for approval. It is reported that the interest rate on this loan is particularly low.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The two British banks responsible for raising £5 million are HSBC, responsible for £3 million, and Mercantile Bank, responsible for £2 million. On the Chinese side, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are responsible for raising funds. This £10 million foreign exchange stabilization fund will be managed by a management committee, with the headquarters reportedly planned to be located in Hong Kong. The committee will include representatives from the two British banks and the two Chinese banks, with another member jointly appointed by the Chinese and British governments, subject to the approval of HSBC and Mercantile Bank. The purpose of establishing this fund is to stabilize the price of Chinese currency, prevent abnormal fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the British pound, and adjust foreign exchange transactions. After the establishment of this foreign exchange stabilization fund loan, the Chinese government's economic and financial policies will adopt the value of stabilizing the Chinese yuan against the British pound, and future purchases of foreign exchange must be transacted with one of the banks on the management committee.</p>
<p>Statement by Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, Announcing the Process of Establishing the Chinese Loan, Confidently Believing that Chinese and Foreign Businesses Will Benefit</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, made the following statement regarding the foreign currency stabilization fund announced in London:</p>
<p>Our Chinese yuan has maintained stability since June of last year. This time, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, together with the British HSBC and Mercantile Bank, have jointly established an equalization fund, which should further consolidate the foundation of the Chinese yuan. On March 12th of last year, due to special circumstances, the government ordered government banks to stop selling foreign exchange without limit at the official price and announced new rules for applying for foreign exchange approval. After implementation, the Shanghai market's exchange rate against the British pound continued to fall, reaching around eight pence in June. At that time, the Bank of China believed that the external value of the Chinese yuan had been excessively devalued. Given the deep faith of the Chinese people in the Chinese yuan, if there were temporary unfavorable news in the military and political situation that caused market agitation, the bank would be determined to maintain stability and it would not be difficult. This maintenance policy was approved by the government and enthusiastically assisted by Chinese and foreign colleagues, and the bank began to work on stabilizing foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Based on past experience, the bank's predictions were not excessive. During the fall of Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Hankou, although we felt the threat of speculators, the foreign exchange market was still able to maintain its balance. Not only that, but whenever the turmoil subsided, the bank was still able to recover all the foreign exchange sold to maintain the Chinese yuan.</p>
<p>According to China's current international balance of payments, there is no need to worry about the outflow of foreign exchange reserves. Now, the major banks of China and Britain have jointly established an equalization fund to cope with all future market shocks, and the resources allocated are several times the amount used by the Bank of China in the past. Both Chinese and foreign businesses are extremely fortunate, as this is of great importance to the stability of the Chinese yuan.</p>
<p>British Officials Declare Continued Support for China; British Government Values Its Interests in China; This Loan Serves as a Warning to Japan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th] After Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced to the House of Commons that two British banks would assist the Chinese government in establishing an exchange equalization fund, officials responsible here recently declared that this fund, located in London, would be operated in the same way as the British exchange equalization fund. The main goal of British support for Chinese legal tender is to safeguard British business in China, not to protect the interests of the gold pound. This move is in no way unfriendly to Japan. If the Japanese government raises objections, it will be explained to them. Previously, the Japanese government repeatedly stated that it must maintain Chinese currency in a manner it deems appropriate. The British government is also eager to maintain Chinese currency prices in a manner it deems appropriate. British businesses are suffering from currency price fluctuations. In short, this move by Britain is within the scope of pursuing a friendly and neutral policy towards China and is not discriminatory against Japan. In the future, it may use other methods to assist China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Those responsible pointed out that the interest payments on loans secured by Chinese customs revenue have never been delayed. As for other loans, China has also paid interest on time. Although China is in difficult circumstances, and some areas with strong tax revenues have fallen into the hands of others, it is still trying its best to maintain its credit. Compared to some countries that deliberately deny it on the pretext of hardship, it is very different. Although this loan to maintain the Chinese currency system plan does not directly affect the management of foreign exchange in North China, it is actually a warning to Japan: the British government will never sit idly by and watch British interests in China be devastated without providing practical assistance. It is also learned that there are many other active measures being considered. Some parties have been constantly demanding that the government take retaliatory measures against Japan to remove restrictions on British interests in China. Those who previously advocated a policy of appeasement now also believe that only retaliatory measures can achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Financial Circles in Shanghai and Hong Kong Pleased with the Rise in the Chinese Yuan Exchange Rate; Domestic and Foreign Bonds Soared Yesterday; Enemy Control of Foreign Exchange in North China is Insignificant <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] After the news of the loan was revealed yesterday morning, the foreign exchange value of the Chinese yuan in Hong Kong and Shanghai increased. In Shanghai, the value of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar rose from 15875 to 16062 yuan, and against the British pound from 8 pence and 1/8 to 8 pence and 9/32. The market is firm. The enemy in North China will implement foreign exchange controls today. Under normal circumstances, our foreign exchange would be affected by it, especially the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the US dollar and British pound. However, not only is there no adverse impact, but it has turned for the better, indicating that the enemy's efforts are futile. In Hong Kong, the exchange rate of the Chinese yuan against the Hong Kong dollar rose from 548 to 556 yesterday. The yuan also followed the Chinese yuan and rose in price, and there is still potential for further increases. The exchange rate also followed the Chinese currency in its appreciation, and has room to increase further.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 9th] After the announcement of the British loan of £10 million (correction: should be £5 million) to China, economic circles here expressed their satisfaction. The market atmosphere has been refreshed, which has not been seen recently. Simon's announcement has caused all domestic public bonds to rise, with enthusiastic buyers. General confidence in the government has also increased. The exchange rate of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar and the British pound has also rebounded. A trading broker told reporters that the success of this loan is extremely beneficial to Shanghai's financial circles.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The Shanghai financial market suddenly became active yesterday. The price of national bonds soared, and the market situation was very stable. The exchange rate of the silver dollar against the British pound and the US dollar also improved. The foreign exchange outlook is very optimistic. As for Hong Kong, the trading of silver dollars has been unusually cold for the past month, but it also changed its usual state yesterday. Speculators are extremely active, but sellers mostly regard this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and are unwilling to release their stored silver dollars immediately for small profits, so there are very few transactions. It is believed that the volume of silver dollar transactions in these few days will definitely break previous records.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] After Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced to the House of Commons that the Chinese government had established an exchange equalization fund, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi issued a statement to the press, saying that this move is sufficient to demonstrate China's strength and that it is capable of coping with financial, commercial, territorial, and administrative matters. British cooperation with China is also sufficient to prove that the Western countries are giving China full and legitimate assistance, which is a measure to safeguard the business and interests of those countries in the Far East. This move by Britain directly helps China, and also proves that the common interests of China and Britain must be safeguarded, which our country warmly welcomes and is willing to do its best to achieve.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] Official opinion here believes that Sir Simon's announcement of a loan to China to stabilize the Chinese government's currency is sufficient to counteract Japanese attempts to undermine the value of the Chinese yuan in North China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] Officials remain silent and have not yet commented on Sir Simon's announcement of a loan to stabilize Chinese currency. However, government officials believe that this move by Britain is related to the recent US loan of $25 million to China. It is said that the US and Britain are prepared to take similar steps to provide financial assistance to China. It is also believed that most of the loan will be at the disposal of the Chinese government, otherwise the effect will be minimal.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] Although the French government does not want to publicly announce loans to China, it will sell military vehicles to China through credit loans.

<h3 id="e16">Shanghai Puppet Organizations Vie for Power <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Since the puppet mayor Chuan Xiaonan took office last year, in order to expand his territory, he planned to include the nine counties near Shanghai, including Shanghai, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Chongming, Taicang, Jiading, and Qingpu, under his jurisdiction. Together with the five districts in the urban area, namely the Southeast District, Pudong North District, Pushe, West Shanghai, and Zhabei, he divided them into fourteen districts, each with a puppet "District Public Office" and dispatched henchmen as puppet "District Chiefs". This caused a fierce dispute with the puppet Jiangsu "Provincial Office", so Chuan's plan could not proceed smoothly. As a result, only the four suburban eight township puppet "Political Affairs Offices" of the former puppet Superintendent's Office were reorganized into puppet "District Public Offices". The eight puppet "District Chiefs" were still succeeded by the former puppet "Political Affairs Chiefs", including Zhu Yuzhen, the puppet "District Chief" of the Southeast District of Pudong, Zhu Rui (a pseudonym for Zhu Yun), Shen Shijing of Nanshi, Li Zidong of West Shanghai, Zhang Pinquan of Zhabei, Yan Gangru of Baoshan, Lu Tieying of Chuansha, and Mei Liyang of Nanhui. Each person was given a puppet "salary" of 360 yuan per month. There were also puppet "Section Chiefs" in each puppet "Office" who received 130 yuan per month, and puppet "Staff Members" who received 100 yuan per month. Together with the expenses of each puppet "Office", the puppet "Municipal Government" had to bear 25,000 yuan per month. Like a bolt from the blue, on the 1st of this month, Chuan Xiaonan suddenly issued a puppet "order" to retain "positions" and suspend "salaries" on the pretext that the puppet treasury was empty. The eight small puppets were extremely shocked and went to Jiangwan together to demand that Chuan Xiaonan withdraw the puppet "order", but to no avail. Because their income was cut off, they were all extremely embarrassed. Now each puppet "Office" has completely stopped handling puppet "affairs" and will undergo reorganization within a week.</p>
<h3 id="e17">British Newspapers Comment on the Exchange Equalization Fund, Saying it is Sufficient to Consolidate Our Currency System and Hoping for Greater Assistance <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The financial correspondent of the "Times" declared today, "After the government lent China £10 million as a Chinese exchange equalization fund, the financial community here expressed a warm welcome, especially those concerned about Chinese trade. The Chinese government has received a lot of assistance from the US Treasury's purchase of silver, but recently the shipment of silver to the US has decreased. Although China still has adequate funds to subsidize foreign exchange, it is not as wealthy as expected. Under these circumstances, the equalization fund, although not essential, will ultimately be welcomed. What is even more important is that Chinese banks are still able to share such a large amount, which is truly gratifying. This fund is large enough to meet all exchange requirements. The fund committee will be located in Shanghai and will be responsible for managing the fund to equalize foreign exchange and control exchange rates. At the same time, we should also pay close attention to Japan's attempt to force the circulation of counterfeit 'Reserve Bank' currency in North China, because although it will not damage the Chinese yuan, it is enough to disrupt North China's normal foreign trade. However, the establishment of this equalization fund has nothing to do with Japan's attempts in North China and is not politically motivated. From a purely commercial point of view, Britain's support for the Chinese yuan is a necessary and constructive policy. This foreign exchange credit loan is related to China's repayment of debts and makes it easier for the Chinese government to manage its position. Therefore, we now hope that the Chinese government can make further progress in repaying debts."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The "News Chronicle" said today, "The stability of the Chinese currency system is extremely necessary for British financial and commercial interests. This is a good reason to help China, but not the best reason. All parties demand that Japan should not carry out large-scale killings of its neighbors. Financial assistance is one way for Britain to help China strengthen its heroic resistance, but there should be even more assistance than this."</p>

<p>— Song Meiling</p>
<p>……Original Text of Speech at the Chongqing Commemoration Meeting……</p>
<p>Anything that benefits the war effort and national reconstruction, we women should not hesitate to take on tasks that men can handle. Especially those important tasks that most women can do. I believe nothing surpasses comforting the families of soldiers at the front and assisting them. We should frequently comfort the soldiers at the front and the families of fallen soldiers, providing them with spiritual comfort. We should help them become self-sufficient, such as by organizing small handicrafts and cooperatives, to prevent economic and living difficulties. We should also assist them in resolving their children's educational issues. In this way, soldiers at the front will have no worries about their families, and our fellow citizens can enthusiastically enlist and go to the front. If we have a smooth way to implement the conscription, victory in the war is certain, and the country will be secure.</p>
<p>I believe that with our women's spirit, we can certainly contribute greatly to the war effort. Just look at the achievements of the women's donation on Sunday, and we can have real confidence. Why can women's donations achieve such results? It is entirely because we have organization, unity, and a spirit of hard work and endurance. We women can mobilize unanimously, regardless of each other, and bring out our forces, whether large or small. With such achievements, I believe we have much more work to do, and not every task needs to have obvious superficial results. Our work is only driven by our patriotic duty and responsibility. We should not hope for praise, or encouragement, but bury our heads in more practical work. The more work that goes unnoticed, the greater the power. We should be unsung heroes in arduous and lonely work, not seeking personal glory, but seeking the glory of the country and nation through collective efforts. In this way, we will certainly be able to raise the status of our women and achieve our more lofty goals through practical work.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens, this war of resistance is a war of justice against violence, a critical moment for national survival, and the prelude to national rejuvenation. We should now ignore everything else, concentrate on winning the war. We must know that justice and righteousness belong to us, and the sympathy of all mankind in the world belongs to us. Let me give you a few examples to prove it.</p>
<p>First, I would like to present to you a precious gift. This is an item that an Indian woman took off her body. She said, "She has deep hatred for the cruelty of the Japanese ×× and infinite sympathy for our Chinese resistance, and is greatly moved by the efforts of our Chinese women in the anti-aggression work. Not having anything to offer, she took off her only property, the ornament she always wore, and donated it to China." I ask you to look at this necklace, how much deep affection is entrusted to it.</p>
<p>Second, I received a letter from an American girl studying abroad, and also attached a gold coin. In her letter, she said that she was an unfortunate woman, but she heard that China was being ravaged by × people so cruelly, and the suffering of Chinese men, women, and children was so deep. She understands the cruel actions of × people towards China, and is not blind. She feels that she should no longer complain about her misfortune. She expressed shame and also expressed her infinite excitement at the courage of Chinese women engaged in anti-aggression. This letter and a gold coin from thousands of miles away are truly moving.</p>
<p>Third, I received a letter from another foreign woman. She said that her fiancé and friends had died on a trip, and she herself was suffering from paralysis, but driven by the idea of justice and morality, she was very concerned about the Sino-Japanese War and prayed for China's victory every day. Her doctor was afraid that she would be too stimulated and even forbade her to read the newspaper. She could not write the letter herself, so she asked her friend to write a letter on her behalf, hoping that our Chinese compatriots could persevere and strive for final victory. You should know that I have been receiving several letters from abroad every day recently.</p>
<p>The above are just a few examples. We see that foreign friends thousands of miles away are like this, how should we, as daughters of the Chinese nation, encourage and urge ourselves to save our country and seek the liberation of our nation, and the true liberation of tens of millions of female compatriots? I am fully confident that it is certain we can achieve our goals with our own sacrifices and struggles, seeking national liberation and the true liberation of tens of millions of female compatriots. I hope that the female compatriots present today will make up their minds, move forward and fight, and write the most glorious contribution in the history of the world's women's movement. (End)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Ninth Dispatch] In the Central Hubei battles, we used powerful troops to launch fierce counter-attacks between Jingzhong and Hanyi roads. About a thousand people are currently in Zhongxiang, belonging to the 13th Regiment of the 6th Division. On the 9th, they continuously bombarded the east bank of the Xiang River all day. Our artillery also returned fire, and 乂 did not dare to cross the river. After our advancing troops arrived near Wamiao and Yihe, 乂 also reinforced and counter-attacked, and a bloody battle is underway.

<h3 id="e20">British War Secretary Reports Good Military Reorganization, Submits Army Budget to the Lower House, Increases Air Defense and Overseas Strength <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Belisha</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London Eighth] War Secretary Belisha submitted the budget for the next year (1939-40) to the House of Commons, totaling £161,133,000, and explained that Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement on February 6, stating that Britain and France have a joint relationship, and if France is attacked without provocation, Britain will support it with all its forces. Therefore, the British Army must prepare everything to be able to go to the European continent to participate in the war if necessary. The goal of the talks between the British and French staff is limited to formulating a joint defense plan and has no aggressive meaning. But as the overall situation is like this, we must reorganize the military so that all kinds of troops can get full supplies, and we must pay attention to the defense of this headquarters to protect the safety of the people.</p>
<p>[Reuters London Eighth] British War Secretary Belisha continued to speak in the House of Commons today on the reorganization of the army. He said: The main issue in the House of Commons is what preparations the British Army should have to deal with once a war breaks out on the European continent. He mentioned Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration of British and French unity, saying that "This makes us have to consider and prepare to use the army in order to deal with certain events. If we are involved in the war, our contribution and the method of application will not be subject to any limited liability principle. The negotiations between our country and France only discuss the plan of self-defense, not for aggressors. On our country’s side, we have a detailed plan. We are willing to exert the greatest power in the war. Therefore, in peacetime, we should adjust production, accumulate reserve goods, and create new production industries in order to supply the army’s equipment and maintain it. As the final period of war danger approaches, the army must be trained and supplied with the necessary equipment. What I am doing is in accordance with this principle." After announcing various reorganizations and increases in personnel, Belisha continued, "Domestic defense is our greatest responsibility and receives our greatest attention. Its development can resist aggressors and keep our people safe. This has been decided and must be completed."</p>
<p>[Reuters London Eighth] British War Secretary Belisha said when submitting the army budget to the House of Commons today that the reorganization of the British Army and the defense of Britain and the Empire have made amazing progress. He first reported on the situation this year, saying that the original two divisions of anti-aircraft artillery teams have been expanded into five divisions, and a headquarters has been set up to command them. The various administrative conveniences of these anti-aircraft artillery teams have also been greatly increased. Many concrete and steel-bone gun beds have been added and are continuing to be added. The artillery has also been increased, and the transportation system and the method of recruiting personnel have been improved. Next year, two more divisions of anti-aircraft artillery teams will be added, totaling seven divisions. The existing fortresses will also be increased by 50% to 100%. Each medium and heavy anti-aircraft artillery fortress is equipped with heavy artillery and searchlights. A factory for manufacturing 3.7-caliber guns has been opened and will be produced this autumn. Swiss-style 40 cm light anti-aircraft artillery can also be manufactured by this autumn. At the same time, it is being purchased from foreign countries. Belisha then discussed overseas defense, saying that our goal is to maintain the garrison troops in each territory so that they can cope with the outbreak of war without affecting the standing army. Local people can be recruited into the army if necessary. The Army Department has decided to add 700 Mudith artillerymen. A location has been found for training Cidis and English artillerymen. The government has sent officers to Cyprus to find out the extent to which the people there are willing to participate in the defense of the Empire. About 1,000 Malay and Indian soldiers will be added in Singapore. The same number will be added to the Chinese and Indian soldiers in Hong Kong. For the first time, the government has added Ceylon soldiers to the coastal defense team and the anti-aircraft artillery team. Troops in other parts of the Empire are also increasing local personnel. In order to seek free action of warships and reduce their original protection duties, the defense of overseas ports has been strengthened. Reserve teams in the Middle East, India, and the Empire are being organized. The current reserve team in the Middle East includes two divisions, stationed in Palestine, with two brigades per division and four battalions per brigade. This reserve team is an independent army and does not need to consume domestic resources. It is hoped that the results of the Charterfield Committee's recommendations will produce a suitable Indian reserve team. Four battalions of British infantry in India have been transferred and are now in the Mediterranean region. The Middle East reserve team, like the domestic national defense forces and the strengthening of overseas garrisons, will not affect the strength of the Empire reserve team. The Empire reserve team can draw on combat troops, train them, and equip them to cope with the war in Europe. The troops include 13 infantry divisions, 2 mechanized teams, 3 armored vehicle teams, 2 cavalry brigades, and other troops. Belisha continued, "Our country’s production situation is very good. We can predict that all regular troops can be fully equipped to cope with the war next year. However, the new armored vehicle division has not yet been established. Only a large number of excellent light tanks are being received. The performance of the women who handle the autonomous territories' troops and affiliated businesses is also good. There are 6,500 national defense groups, and more will be added in the future. Regarding recruitment matters, soldiers of all levels have reached 531,353 people (excluding the central army of India and Myanmar), indicating that 83,000 people have been added in December." Regarding the mobilization plan, Belisha said, "Within four days of mobilization, 200 central locations can supply the combat troops' needs. After mobilization, the recruited troops can join the autonomous territories' troops to support the war."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Paris, Day Telegram] French officials are very welcome to War Secretary Belisha's speech because it confirms that if a war breaks out in Europe, British troops will go to the continent to fight. France has recently believed that if a war breaks out, France will bear the brunt. Now the British authorities' statement is enough to dispel their concerns.</p>
<p>[Haitong Guo London Ninth Telegram] According to today's Daily Express, War Secretary Belisha announced in the House of Commons yesterday that in the near future, British and French military officers will hold a meeting. The telegram also said that the topic to be discussed in the future is expected to be the number of expeditionary forces dispatched by Britain in the event of war.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Japanese Soldiers ×××× Secretly Expand the Military <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Tokyo Communication] According to the Associated Press, visiting reporter Mr. Lee Clay in Tokyo stated that the Japanese soldiers, in view of the two years of war in China, are trapped in deep mud, with huge losses and a worrying future, are actively rebuilding the army, navy, and air force in secret. The military buildup plan is absolutely kept secret from the people, for fear that the people will rise up against it due to the increased burden. However, the army and navy are quite active. The battle was promoted in the recent parliament, and 1,550,000,000 yuan has been proposed as the military expenditure for the next year. The purpose is three points: 1. To prepare for war with the Soviet Union, this is the last wish of the Japanese army. 2. To fundamentally control the western Pacific with naval and air force strength and prevent the British and American interference in Japan's continental aggression policy. This is the task of the Japanese navy. In short, Japan's new military expansion plan is to attempt to realize its inherent dream of climbing to the status of a world power. The Japanese army is confident that only by conquering with force can Japan enter the extreme of world politics and economy. Regarding the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty, which will expire in mid-March, the Japanese side is strenuously propagating that the Soviet Union will refuse to renew it, so the rumors that Japan intends to go to war with the Soviet Union are quite noisy. The parliament even passed a bill requiring the government to "strive for fishing rights with all its strength." As for the United States, Japan would regard it as its only enemy in the Pacific, but it does not dare to provoke it at present, because the Japanese navy personnel admit that the Japanese fleet is only enough to resist the US attack, but has no strength to counterattack the United States. However, they still brazenly said that if the United States wants to enter the West Pacific and interfere with Japan's maritime blockade operations, a Japanese-American war may still break out. Once this fact occurs, it will be the Japanese navy to launch its dream of a southward policy. The central purpose of this policy is in the rich Dutch East Indies. They said that they do not intend to explore the southward policy until all routes have been blocked. What is worth noting is that Japan's naval expansion plan is now being promoted particularly actively. This year's naval general budget is 113,000,000 yuan, and there is a supplementary budget, but it refuses to publish it. Its entire plan can be completed in about three years. According to the Naval Minister Yonei's report to the members of parliament, the Japanese navy's plan pays special attention to the increase in aircraft. However, Yonei did not agree to talk about the matter of adding four 35,000-ton large cruisers, only said that there are indeed warships under construction.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo Ninth Telegram] Yesterday afternoon, the House of Representatives held a budget debate. Aoki, the president of the Planning Bureau, replied to a question about the four-year plan to develop industrial production, saying, "After the completion of the four-year plan, China and Japan can be self-sufficient in steel, iron, coal, light metals, zinc, automobiles, ships, and railway equipment. If 1938 is the base year, then the iron in 1941 will increase by 250%. The percentage of other increased production is as follows: steel, 60%; special steel, 200%; coal, 30%; copper, 80%; lead, 90%; zinc, 70%; gold, 20%; automobiles, 50%; locomotives, 30%; passenger cars, 70%; freight cars, 50%."</p>

<p>[Reuters London Eighth] According to responsible sources, the British government is now considering the true proposal on the Palestine issue and will submit it to the Arab and Jewish delegations in the middle of next week. It is reported that the British government submitted some proposals to the Arab and Jewish sides ten days ago, and now their attitudes have been clarified. Although there are still some details to be discussed, it is believed that the government is now working hard to seek a possible solution. In the next few days of this week, we will specifically discuss the so-called "British government's final proposal on the Palestine issue" and learn that the British government is particularly willing to discuss it jointly with the Arab and Jewish sides. The government does not believe that the future is hopeless, and the meeting will continue to be held to see whether the British government's proposal can promote a solution. If the proposal is still not accepted by the Arab and Jewish sides, it is heard that the British government will unilaterally solve it. [Reuters London Eighth] British Colonial Minister MacDonald replied to a question on the Palestine Conference in the House of Commons today, saying that he could not make any statement other than what he reported on the 27th of last month. Liberal Party member Mr. Pidd asked whether Mr. MacDonald could guarantee that the Palestine Conference would still be based on the League of Nations mandate. MacDonald replied that the government is still bound by the treaty, but it is not convenient to make any further statement at present.</p>

Butler also replied to another question, saying that according to the information obtained by Foreign Secretary Halifax, the Italian government increased its troops in Libya by 30,000.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] Senator Hale stated that he supports any government steps to repeal the Neutrality Act. However, he questioned why Roosevelt previously advocated for the enactment of the Neutrality Act but now advocates for its repeal, and the reasons for this should be explained. Senator Lewis has submitted a bill to the Senate to repeal the Neutrality Act.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] After the Senate passed the National Defense Bill today, it was submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion. The main amendments to the bill by the Senate include increasing the number of army aircraft to 6,000 and limiting the maximum expenditure on aircraft and other equipment for the army to $300 million. Administration officials expressed opposition to the limitation on aircraft expenditures. In addition to stipulating an increase in the number of aircraft, the National Defense Bill also allocated $23,750,000 to maintain the fortifications of the Panama Canal and $34,500,000 to order a large quantity of war materials.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 9th] Gaeta wrote an article in "Il Giornale d'Italia" today, stating that the activities of pro-war elements in the United States have caused Roosevelt to develop the idea of using force against totalitarian states, with Stimson being the most prominent.

<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] In the House of Commons today, Member of Parliament Whit asked Under-Secretary Butler to explain the purpose and intention of the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to establish a special agency headed by Japanese officials. The Under-Secretary stated that he had not received any information regarding the purpose of this special agency, but he knew that the proceedings did not infringe upon the powers of the Municipal Council. When asked why the Japanese refused to withdraw from British cotton mills in Shanghai, Butler said that despite repeated explanations from the British Consul-General in Shanghai, the Japanese side still doubted whether three of the cotton mills were British-owned. As for the fourth cotton mill located on Chongming Island, it had been occupied by the Japanese army and used as a transportation hub. The British government had recently protested to Tokyo about this matter. In short, the government will ensure that the Japanese quickly withdraw from British cotton mills. When asked when the warship transportation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou could be restored, Butler reiterated his previous response and added that it was not yet possible to predict when the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway would reopen. This matter is currently being discussed by the British Consul-General in Guangzhou and the Japanese Consul.</p>

<h3 id="e34">New Japanese Law <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th reports that the Japanese government has submitted a new law to the Diet to manage the issuance of banknotes by the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, and the Bank of Taiwan. It is preparing to implement controls over the issuance of banknotes by these three national banks to issue banknotes according to military needs and states that this law may be repealed one year after the end of the "Sino-Japanese Incident."</p>
<p>It is to be expected that such laws will inevitably lead to more dangerous "malignant inflation," making Japan's financial and economic difficulties more serious. What we should pay particular attention to here is that this new law of the Japanese government shows that the Japanese aggressors are intensifying their plunder of money from within Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, preparing to continue their war of "conquering China." Therefore, while we feel great pity for the future lives of the people of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, we should also more clearly understand the determination of the Japanese aggressors to destroy our country. There are still a few compatriots who mistakenly believe that the Japanese aggressors are prepared to repent and cease hostilities. We are reluctant to say that these people are intentionally being used by traitors, but in reality, such erroneous observations and arguments are sufficient to confuse the public, eliminate hatred, and allow the Japanese to advance smoothly. Therefore, we should not only be vigilant against this "peace" discourse and advocacy but also expose and attack it.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Germany's Great Highway Plan <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Dong Ping</p>
<p>— Another Exposure of Hitler's Eastern Advance Policy —</p>
<p>Original by Roger Shaw. Published in "Modern Historical Materials," February issue.</p>
<p>One night in mid-December last year, the largest public theater in Berlin held a "Comrades' Entertainment Party." Three thousand road construction workers attended, and Hitler himself attended; the Führer's police band also came to the event to play music. The situation was no less enthusiastic than Americans celebrating Christmas.</p>
<p>These three thousand road construction workers represent a very important German national organization. Its task is to build motorways. The purpose of that night's entertainment party was to celebrate the completion and unveiling of Germany's 3,000-kilometer highway network. Superficially, the purpose of building this highway network was to relieve unemployed people in Germany; but in reality, it was a purely military plan. Like the crisscrossing roads in the ancient Roman Empire, it was entirely used for rapid military transport.</p>
<p>The designer of this highway is a German engineer named Todt. The new fortress in the Rhineland area of ​​Germany, facing the French Maginot Line, also came from his mind.</p>
<p>Todt's highway network extends from the North Sea plains to the foothills of the Alps, from the industrially prosperous West to the barren East. On this highway, there is not a single village or a single thought, so driving cars can use the fastest speed without any restrictions.</p>
<p>Todt's plan is to expand by 1,000 kilometers every year. At the same time, under Todt's plan, a "National Socialist Motor Corps" was formed; this "Motor Corps" has great political significance; it is the same as the Brown Shirt "Stormtroopers" and the Black Shirt "Iron Guard," and is one of the three major armies of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>However, Germany's great highway plan is not so simple. Todt and his financial backer – the Reichsbank – are now preparing to extend this highway outside of Germany. According to their new plan, the first step is to extend it to Germany's newest victory, Czechoslovakia; then, a highway can extend from German Silesia, from north to south, directly to Vienna. In this way, the garrisons in Silesia and Austria can be concentrated in an instant, advancing eastward along the highways of the Czech Republic to attack Poland or Soviet Ukraine. Similarly, this north-south highway is also very rewarding for German-Austrian trade.</p>
<p>Germany is preparing to build this road with its own funds, and it also wants to manage it with full authority; even in the Czech territory along the road, Germany will enjoy extraterritoriality, which is simply a "German Corridor" within Czech territory. German merchants and people in this corridor do not need passports at all and are not subject to Czech inspection.</p>
<p>In fact, this is only the prelude to Germany's highway plan in Czechoslovakia; the rest is still being secretly designed. At the same time, the Czech government is now planning to build a highway in the country from west to east. All the grinding materials have been prepared, and it is estimated that 50,000 to 100,000 workers will be needed to complete the work in five or six years. But if Todt also joins in to help, I believe it can be completed quickly.</p>
<p>Now it can be said more clearly, if this Jinbu plan is completed, the German army can quickly concentrate from both ends of Silesia and Vienna along the "German Corridor" to the Czech Republic; then, it can rush eastward along the highways of the Czech Republic; reaching the border of Romania, which is the richest in oil production, which has long been coveted by the National Socialist Party. Extending from Romania to the southeast, it can reach the Black Sea and the important Soviet Ukrainian seaport of Odessa - a major goal of the National Socialist Party. To put it more simply, all the highways are heading straight for Ukraine; there is abundant wheat and ore and complex folk customs.</p>
<p>If a war breaks out between Germany and the Soviet Union, automobiles will occupy a very important position; tanks, armored vehicles, trucks, command vehicles, shells, and all other vehicles must be active. The armies of Germany and the Soviet Union have long seen this and are busy preparing. Infantry, artillery, and supply teams are all actively being motorized.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party understands very well that the modern god of war is motorized; therefore, the entire German automobile industry is adapting to military needs, and Nanchang has standardized trucks and passenger cars. All trucks are divided into three types: one and a half tons, three tons, and five tons. There were originally 135 types of passenger cars, but now they are also limited to 15 types, all of which are suitable for military use. Motorized bicycles are also very important to the army, and Germany is storing them in large quantities.</p>
<p>Germany's motorized units now have three divisions, about 30,000 people; it has recently recruited a fourth division. However, Germany's cavalry has only one battalion, all of whom are descendants of the famous East Prussian cavalry. Recently, I heard that new cavalry are being recruited, preparing to be used on the plains of the East.</p>
<p>Germany's current land strength is roughly like this: 42 regular divisions, but the artillery is very short; 6 Austrian divisions, the results are not very good; 2 elite reserve divisions in East Prussia; among the other 38 reserve divisions, artillery, officers, and transportation are very far behind. This number totals about one million people, but the number of people is large, but the strength is not as good as generally imagined. This is because Germany only started training its own army in 1935.</p>
<p>But, if Germany really attacks Soviet Ukraine with the "Motor Corps," what is the Soviet Union's ability to respond?</p>
<p>Naturally, the Soviet Union is not willing to show weakness and is now actively preparing to counter Todt's big plan. Moscow's most famous Stalin Plant and Molotov Plant are the centers of Soviet automobile manufacturing, and the two plants produce 200,000 vehicles and $70 million worth of automobile parts every year.</p>
<p>Now, a highway is being built between Soviet Ukraine and Manchuria. It is generally believed that the construction of this road is actually part of a counterattack against Hitler's plan.</p>
<p>There have been many automobile competitions in the world. In the near future, automobile competitions will unfold in front of us in a new way, and the fate of Europe will be determined on that surface.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Britain Actively Strengthens Far East Defenses, Will Recruit Chinese and Indian Soldiers in Hong Kong, Quota Set at One Thousand, Trained by British Officers, Hong Kong Air Force Commander Replaced, Brands Succeeds <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense, and Hong Kong's position has become increasingly important. Therefore, the British authorities have been actively strengthening Hong Kong's defenses in recent years. Yesterday (8th), the British House of Commons held a meeting to discuss the army's budget. The Secretary of State for War, Mr. Hore-Belisha, explained the various figures in the budget (see another article on page 4). Among them, regarding Hong Kong, he said that Hong Kong's defenses have become increasingly consolidated after being strengthened. At the same time, the number of defense forces has increased by more than 3,000. It is now decided to recruit a total of one thousand Chinese and Indian people, who will be appropriately trained by British officers to defend Hong Kong. The British Secretary of State for War, Mr. Hore-Belisha, said that the purpose of recruiting soldiers locally in overseas territories is to maintain peace in the area during peacetime and to ensure that the strength of the regular army is not affected in the event of a war and to take responsibility for defending itself. Therefore, if the environment requires it, local people will be recruited to engage in military tasks. From 1938 to 1939, the number of troops recruited locally in British territories was 250,000, which was more than the number of overseas territorial troops set in the past. This is a special situation that has never been seen before in peacetime. It is estimated that 77,800 people have responded to the call this year, while only 45,000 in the previous year. In addition, Singapore, which is closely related to Hong Kong, will also recruit one thousand people this year, the same number as Hong Kong. In addition, it is reported that the current Hong Kong Air Force Commander, Mr. Smeeton, has completed his term of office, and the vacancy will be filled by Squadron Leader Brands. It is known that Mr. Brands has served as the commander of the 35th Bomber Squadron of the British Air Force in Newton and other positions. Also, the army, navy, and air force stationed in Hong Kong have been constantly practicing for months to review Hong Kong's offensive and defensive strength. At 9:00 am yesterday, the Cape D'Aguilar Battery also held a cannon exercise. The sound of cannons rumbled and resonated far and wide. The exercise ended at 6:00 pm. The Hong Kong military authorities issued a notice in advance to inform the public.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Emergency Refugee Association in Fanling, Manages Education for Refugee Children, Over a Thousand Students in Primary Schools and Kindergartens, Lack of Classrooms, Seven Hundred Out of School <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Association held a meeting at St. John's Cathedral at 5:30 pm yesterday. The attendees included Father Watterhouse, Mrs. Situ Yongjue, Miss Budinger, Huang Maolin, Father Lai Yien, Professor Foster, Miss Buko Yili, and others. Father Lai Yien chaired the meeting, and the secretary read the following report: (1) Financial report: The income for the month, together with the balance from January, totaled HK$122,334.32, and the expenditure totaled HK$30,304.38. The balance after income and expenditure was HK$92,029.64. The income in national currency, together with the balance from last month, was 63,949.78, totaling 63,999.78. The expenditure totaled 13,700 yuan, and the balance after income and expenditure was 50,299.78 yuan. The income in the construction fee account, together with the amount transferred from last month, was HK$20,714.45, totaling HK$39,814.45. The expenditure totaled HK$20,000, and the balance after income and expenditure was HK$19,414.45.</p>
<p>Establish People's Palace</p>
<p>Regarding the People's Camp, the Association has set up 40 People's Palaces. If the Public Works Department completes the various drainage facilities in time, they will be available for residence on the 19th of this month. Currently, there are 225 applications for residence, which are currently being considered one by one by the People's Palace Committee, but very few meet the requirements. The requirement is that they have a current occupation and have suffered significant losses due to the war. However, these 40 residents will now be selected separately. The subsidy granted by the Hong Kong government is 18,700 yuan. In addition to expenses such as construction, there is still a slight surplus. The Hong Kong government has now been asked to waive rates and to ask the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to agree to repay the advances in seven years. The rent for each People's Palace is less than ten yuan, and it is hoped that this number will include half of the electricity bill.</p>
<p>Refugee Tents</p>
<p>Regarding the various refugee tents, there have been many changes in the facilities of the various tents since the last conference. The North and South Tents in Fanling were closed on the 3rd of last month, but reopened on the 21st of last month, but they are no longer responsible for providing food. The Third Tent in Fanling has also been reopened, but it is managed by the International Red Cross. These three tents currently house 2,522 refugees. A new tent was built at San Uk Ling near the border on the 2nd of this month, which currently houses 910 people. The Association is currently responsible for managing the education of refugee children in Fanling. A place has now been obtained to teach 200 refugee children. The executive department of the Association has now approved the construction of a shed near the new tent for teaching refugee children, and another shed for the residence of staff. It has now been completed.</p>
<p>Education for Refugee Children</p>
<p>The British Zhenfen Branch and the Education Department have not approved the Association's application for education subsidies, so the Association can only manage within the 600 yuan education fee per month. At the same time, enthusiastic educators are invited to donate. Kindergartens and primary schools have been open for six weeks, with a total of about 1,100 students. The school to be set up in San Uk Ling and the new school in Kam Tin will both open next week, and the number can increase to 1,500, but due to the lack of classrooms, there are still 700 school-age children who do not have the opportunity to receive education. As for craft teaching, the grass bag products of the Kam Tin tent are quite successful, with four being produced each month. The King's Park ball field tent also produces a lot of bamboo brooms, with hundreds of orders received every day. A commissioner has now been appointed to be responsible for inspecting the handicraft work of the various tents and planning new facilities, hoping to make progress in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Air Defense Exhibition Tour <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Modern warfare is three-dimensional warfare, and it is also the most brutal. Progress in science itself is not sinful, but it is the aggressive nations that misuse science that are to be condemned. Condemnation is the cry of the weak; to eliminate armed force, one must ultimately resort to armed force; one must utilize science.</p>
<p>Our motherland has launched a sacred national liberation struggle to oppose aggression and eliminate tyrannical armed forces. No matter how the × people bomb and destroy, we are tempered and reborn in the war of resistance. This great war of the era has been unfolding on our vast territory for twenty months.</p>
<p>Under a forest of umbrellas, this reporter, along with a crowd of onlookers, ascended to the first floor of the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon to tour the Air Defense Exhibition. The first impression upon entering the first exhibition room was a huge painting titled "The Power of a Bomb Exploding Fifty Feet Away." It reminded people of the horror of the moment a bomb descends! Many compatriots who have fled to Hong Kong have already tasted this feeling! Could it be coming to Hong Kong? The second shocking picture was "Air Defense Instructor on Duty." The raging flames, the collapsed beams and walls after the bombing, and the casualties everywhere reminded people that this is already the common fate of our compatriots today!</p>
<p>Inside the room were models of four people, wearing special air defense and disinfection suits, as well as gas masks. The children said curiously and fearfully, "Ghosts—ghosts!" Yes, these are scientific "ghosts." To prevent soldiers on the front lines from being killed by × people's poison gas, we should transport a large number of gas masks to make them "ghosts" with resistance.</p>
<p>One room demonstrated how to seal windows with screens after glass windows were shattered by explosions to prevent the intrusion of poisonous gas. There was also a complete set of seven first-aid medicines on display, which could be purchased for five dollars.</p>
<p>The paintings of families building shelters seemed to be hinting that visitors should quickly grab axes and saws. In addition, there were also "Models of Chinese-style houses converted into air defense instructor posts," "Shelter models," and "Gas-proof windows," all of which were scientific equipment.</p>
<p>The first impression upon entering the second room was a "First-Aid Station Model" with a scale of six minutes to one foot, demonstrating the process of treating the wounded entering the station in an orderly manner. The attendant explained carefully to the visitors, causing the listeners to stick out their tongues and sigh, "So thoughtful! But it's better if such a situation doesn't happen!"</p>
<p>There was a "Poison Gas Gate Model." Those who were curious and wanted to experience it for themselves went in and held their breath for a moment before running out. Now, it was being treated as a game toy.</p>
<p>A section of the "Mask Management Method" displayed many gas masks, allowing visitors to try them on freely, and they put on "ghost faces" as if for fun. They laughed at each other before dispersing.</p>
<p>In addition, there were also "Civilian Masks," "Poison Gas Damage to the Body Meter," etc., all of which could give visitors a lot of common knowledge. Responsible for reception and explanation were Chinese and Western service personnel. Especially the girls in ambulance uniforms were solemn, lively, and moving. The reporter said secretly: If they return to the motherland and really practice what they learned, wouldn't it be even greater and more meaningful!</p>
<p>At the entrance of the first and second rooms, several Western women were selling pamphlets on "Building a Shelter," teaching people how to set up a shelter. It was easy to take out a dime to buy one. But to build it accordingly was not something everyone could do. The reporter stayed for a long time and learned that most of the customers were foreigners. There was also a notice calling on people to participate in the air defense training courses organized by the Air Defense Committee. To enrich wartime knowledge, this was necessary.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western men, women, old and young, as well as school students, came to visit in groups, which was extremely crowded. When the reporter stepped out of the door, several women without socks were turned away from the crowd pouring in. They knew to join in the fun and see something new, but they neglected that this was the "Peninsula Hotel," and finally left with disappointment and complaints.</p>
<p>In the open space opposite the Peninsula Hotel, there was also an outdoor air defense exhibition, covered with cloth curtains on the outside. Inside, there was a real air-raid shelter, very delicate, which could accommodate six people. The reporter drilled in to inspect it. The alarms again and again, the sound of bombing, the panicked state of women and children… the tragic past immediately rushed into the realm of memory. Is this the "past"? No! This is still the life lesson of the vast compatriots of the motherland—××××××××××, thinking of this, I felt a deep sadness!</p>
<p>It was reported that at 3:30 this afternoon, the disinfection team will conduct a drill at the outdoor exhibition area on the open space opposite the hotel, releasing poisonous gas at that time, and the team members will quickly go to the scene of the incident to survey and then carry out disinfection work, in order to increase the actual air defense knowledge of visitors. If the weather is clear next Saturday and Sunday, exercises on extinguishing incendiary bombs will also be carried out in the afternoon in the above-mentioned open space.</p>
<p>"Air Defense Exhibition"—Is this ultimately preparation for the worst? ××××××××?</p>
<h3 id="e41">Compensation Distribution Method for the Luohu Bombing Incident: Chinese $300, Indian Soldiers $500, British Soldiers $3000 <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The incident of Japanese aircraft bombing Luohu in the New Territories has been resolved lightly with compensation of 20,000 yuan after Ando, commander-in-chief of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, sent Chief of Staff Tanaka to Hong Kong to represent the Japanese government and negotiate with the Hong Kong authorities. All the details have been reported in the newspapers. According to the reporter's investigation, this international incident, which shook the world, could be resolved in such a short time and at such a small price.</p>
<p>After the Luohu incident, the British side not only proposed compensation for losses and a guarantee that similar incidents would not happen again, but also proposed varying degrees of compensation. The British Foreign Office, after negotiations with Japan, soon received a telegram from the Colonial Office in Hong Kong, requesting compensation of 300 yuan per person for the six Chinese who died, 500 yuan for the one Indian soldier, and 3,000 yuan for the one British soldier, plus 8,000 yuan for material property losses. Since Japanese aircraft flew into British territory to bomb, it was a contempt for Britain and a violation of international law, so they specially requested compensation of 10,000 yuan, totaling ¥***. When Japanese Chief of Staff Tanaka arrived in Hong Kong and held negotiations at the Deputy Secretary's Office, Tanaka expressed full acceptance of the compensation item and promised to compensate a total of 20,000 yuan.</p>

<p>There are approximately 4,000 printing workers in Hong Kong, most of whom work in newspaper offices. Their wages range from more than ten yuan to more than twenty yuan. Among them, those who work in printing houses work the longest, with daily working hours constantly between fourteen and sixteen hours. Due to the excessively long working hours, they are mentally exhausted, and many have developed opium addiction. The Printing Trade Union previously petitioned the Hong Kong Labour Department to improve working hours. It is reported that after receiving the petition, the Labour Department has scheduled to summon representatives of the union on the 15th of this month to inquire about everything in detail, so as to understand the living conditions of the workers and improve them.</p>

<p>Educational institutions in the country have been ravaged and destroyed by ×. Thousands of educators from various places have fled to Hong Kong. They usually live frugally, so they feel even more difficult after fleeing to Hong Kong. It is now found that about 200 of them have jointly requested political figures in Hong Kong to turn to the education authorities for relief. Many members of the Central Committee in Hong Kong held a discussion meeting yesterday to discuss the matter. Participants included Hu Wencan, Deng Qingyang, Chen Ce, and others. As a result, it was decided to draft detailed and fundamental relief measures, submit them to the central government, and request consultation with the Guangdong Education Department. The method is to discuss with Chinese schools in Hong Kong that have been registered with the Ministry of Education to borrow classrooms and use the evening or afternoon hours to run free schools for civilians or other easy-to-manage vocational schools, so that they can both educate out-of-school children and refugees, and rescue unemployed teachers, killing two birds with one stone. Detailed measures are being drafted and will be sent out soon. According to reports from various Central Committee members, among the unemployed educators in Hong Kong, there is a former director of teaching affairs at a middle school in Guangzhou who is now selling salty crispy peanuts at the Royal Pier to make a living. This is enough to show the general difficult living conditions of unemployed educators. Therefore, rescuing them is extremely urgent.</p>

<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>Tea Party Jointly Hosted by Wang, Mao, Ruan, Liu, and Hu</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] It was a relaxed gathering - a tea party jointly hosted by Wang Xiaolai, Ruan Weiyang, Mao Heyuan, Liu Qingxuan, and Hu Yu. Those present included people from the news media, film, drama, and famous ladies. It was truly a lively gathering.</p>
<p>The clock struck four, and the upper floors of the Hong Kong Hotel gradually became lively, because the order had not yet begun. In the living room, it became everyone's temporary social arena. People from the news media, film industry, and famous figures from various circles gathered in separate groups, chatting and laughing freely without restraint. After a while, film star Hu Die and Jin Suqin also arrived, surrounded by famous ladies.</p>
<p>Sipping black tea, Ruan Weiyang stood up and gave a speech, saying that he would introduce a friend to everyone. Who is this friend? It is Jin Suqin - now, please Miss Jin come out and meet everyone. Jin Suqin stood up with a bit of shyness - smilingly nodding to the audience, her willow-leaf eyebrows smiling even more.</p>
<p>Following that, Ruan Weiyang introduced Jin's work in Hong Kong this time. Next was Ouyang Yuqian's speech, describing his acquaintance with Jin Suqin, Jin's correct understanding of drama, and her efforts to improve old dramas. Then he talked about Jin's acting skills, believing that Jin's singing was the best, and her movements and figure were also good!</p>
<p>During the conversation, Mr. Wang Xiaolai arrived, and he could not help but say a few words. Following that, Jin Suqin, Chen Xiaowei, Gu Wuwei, and others also stood up to speak, all expressing their views on the old drama reform movement.

<h3 id="e48">Raising Funds to Rescue Wounded Soldiers and Refugees: "The Eve" Performed Tonight and Tomorrow, Tonight and Tomorrow Night at St. Paul's Girls' School <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The drama craze is sweeping from mainland China to Hong Kong in this year, and it is truly thriving. Many famous dramas have been performed one after another using different Mandarin, Cantonese, or English, and many of them are for raising funds to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. If we cannot forget to commend this point, we must mention "The Eve," which will be performed at St. Paul's Girls' School tonight and tomorrow night.</p>
<p>"The Eve" is a masterpiece by the famous writer Yang Hansheng. It is a national defense drama that exposes the activities of traitors and the struggles of patriotic youth in Tianjin before its fall. Performing it at this time and place has great significance. Why is it also a charity event co-organized by St. Paul's Girls' School and the Hong Kong United Youth Society?</p>
<p>"The Eve" has been rehearsed many times at the girls' school under the guidance of Li Mulong. The cast members are entirely selected from the students of the school and many of its alumni. Wu Ailing plays a traitor. Bai Cishan's wife (Zheng Wenxuan) is in love with her tutor. Her methods and expressions of seducing young people, as well as her jealous performance, are good. But the best part is her sad and charming attitude when she tells her life story to her lover! Su Mane plays Bai Qinghong, the traitor's niece, and Pei Lian plays Liu Jicheng, the traitor's lackey. One is alert and wise, making her an opponent to her father, while the other shows the old, cunning, and slippery actions of a traitor. Li Huiqing plays Bai Cishan, and Song Shuqin plays Lin Jianping, both of whom can express the true vigor of saving the country.

<h3 id="e49">Situation on the Northern Front Enters New Stage: × Troops Massing 6-7,000 in Congzengjian, Our Troops Prepare Counter-Offensive and Intensify Deployment, Yubei Militia Scores Victory Attacking × Camp in Jiangcun, Fengyong Official Kiln × Afraid of Us and Dares Not Disturbe <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Express News from Northern River] The southern invading × chief has recently repeatedly begged the Taiwan Xiamen × base camp for aid, plotting the last struggle. Therefore, it has recently been rumored that × troops have increased in number, being transferred to Guangdong, planning to spy on the north and invade the southern route to commit crimes in Guangxi. Therefore, the situation in the Guangdong war has entered a new stage. It is found that there are 6,000 to 7,000 × troops recently gathered in the Congbei Zengcheng strongholds. The information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Our Troops on the Northern Front Will Launch a Counter-Offensive</p>
<p>According to military news, Commander Zhang Fakeui of the Fourth War Zone, in order to smash the × bandits' conspiracy to spy on the north, took the opportunity to launch a counter-offensive. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed the frontline garrisons to attack the × on the date. It is found that the × in Huaxian Xinjie on the southern section of the Guangdong Road have been repeatedly raided by our Chen Division in recent days and are now in a state of panic. The × troops at the Sheigang Taipingchang strongholds are also afraid of our Liang's attack and are stepping up the construction of defensive stubborn resistance. It is heard that our counter-offensive military affairs on the northern front have been intensified, and it has been decided to launch them in the near future. In addition to the main attack on the front, a pincer movement will be used to advance from Tanfang on the left wing towards Zhongxin Fuhe, etc., in order to cut off the communication between the Conghua Zengcheng × troops, and join the Eastern Route Army to control Zengcheng.</p>
<p>Yubei Militia Scores Victory Attacking ×</p>
<p>In addition, the Second District Guerrilla Commander Wu Guanqi ordered Deputy Commanders Li Shuzong and Peng Linsheng to lead their troops in Fanyu Conghua Huaxian to launch guerrilla warfare to annihilate × for several months. Especially the Yubei Township militia is even more active, repeatedly launching attacks on various strongholds, making × exhausted. On the 4th of this month, our guerrilla team, which was ambushing in a certain place, gathered dozens of people at 9 p.m. and suddenly attacked the × camp in the suburbs of Jiangcun. In the darkness, they secretly sneaked up to the × camp. The × sentry could not detect it. At the sound of a secret signal, each team of soldiers fired at the × with machine guns and box cannons. Hearing the sound of gunfire, the × troops were startled and fought back in panic. Our team of soldiers bravely charged and killed. For a time, the sound of gunfire was rapid, like a string of beads. More than a dozen × troops were annihilated. Soon, × reinforcements arrived, and our team of soldiers returned to their original defenses after completing their mission. In this battle, they also obtained a × light machine gun and several long and short guns. Since this battle, the × army in Yubei has been extremely panicked and has intensified its vigilance day and night, inspecting the people coming and going in various villages to prevent our team of soldiers from attacking again.</p>
<p>According to Fengyong, The official kiln lies dormant in a corner</p>
<p>According to another report, on the Chantan Highway, the × entrenched in Guanyao Fengyong has been continuously reinforced, sending troops to disturb the towns of Sanjiang, Yinggang, Tanbu, and Fanhu near the hospital. After our guerrilla teams intercepted them in separate ways, they suffered heavy losses repeatedly. The × began to retreat to their original defenses and lie dormant, slightly restraining their atrocities. It is found that in Luoping Sanjiang, Yinggang Fanhu, and other places, the × troops have not dared to disturb in recent weeks. Therefore, the border between Nanhai and Sanshui has been quite peaceful in the past week. However, some traitors and local ruffians have taken the opportunity to collude and rob the villagers and people coming and going, which is extremely rampant. Those with a little property are often taken to ransom, regardless of the amount. For a time, there are thorns everywhere, and bandits are like hair. The nearby villagers are in a great situation of either dying from × or from bandits, and the situation is extremely difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Provincial Government Issues Order Commending Loyal Martyrs: Donating Money and Sacrificing Lives, the Mountains and Rivers are Magnificent; Achieving Benevolence and Taking Righteousness, the Sun and Moon Compete for Glory <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Correspondence] The Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday issued an order to the administrative commissioners of each district, the original text of which reads, "It has been found that the virtues are excellent, and the Central Government has decided to commend them. The loyal martyrs have achieved benevolence, and Qing Shi will serve as an example. The upright spirit fills the world, and this virtue is famous in the country. The great ones are related to the rise and fall of the nation, and the small ones are related to saving the fence. To change customs and eliminate turbidity is no small matter. Since the late Qing Dynasty, our party has advocated revolution, and people of benevolence and lofty ideals have emerged one after another. Those who have sacrificed their minds, energy, wealth, and lives to engage in innovation are countless. Some even do not occupy success, but return to their original state and remain hidden, living in poverty in remote areas, and their surnames are no longer mentioned, and there are many such people everywhere. Although the central government has tried its best to search for them, there may be some that have not been fully recorded. Since the Anti-Japanese War, famous cities have been lost, and houses have been turned into ruins. All those with blood and energy have the same hatred for the enemy. In the meantime, those who united to defend themselves, donated money and sacrificed their lives, bravely annihilated the enemy, died tragically, and the four husbands and wives who were unwilling to surrender to the enemy and sacrificed their lives to save the country are even more countless. Strengthening the spirit of the mountains and rivers and competing for the light of the sun and moon, the nation will not perish, and all rely on this. To explain the hidden virtues of the secluded light and express the great integrity of loyalty and chastity, it is appropriate to show condolence to encourage the future. Each administrative inspector should turn to the county magistrates under his jurisdiction to persuade them to search for them, and report them according to the merits. Those who collude with the enemy to act as traitors and are willing to humiliate themselves will be abandoned by the people of the country and should be punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing traitors, enforce the law to rope them, or present a clear wanted notice to do the rest, so that the evil will be eliminated and the truth will be distinguished between the superiors and the subordinates, and the sun will be bright and the shadows will disappear, and the spring and autumn will be severe and the axes will rejoice. The future of the Anti-Japanese War is truly dependent on this. In addition to the separate orders, the command is to follow them, and turn to the subordinates to follow them, and still report the obedience. This order, Chairman Li Hanhun."</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Food Problem in Chao-Shan <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenqiang</p>
<p>During the war of resistance, it is certainly important for the government to enrich military spending and maintain tax revenues, but improving the people's lives to enhance the strength of the resistance is also an urgent task. Moreover, the current exemption of import duties on foreign rice does not have much impact on the government's financial revenue. The reason is that high exchange rates make the cost of foreign rice high. Coupled with an import duty of more than three yuan in national currency per unit, it has made the price of foreign rice so high that it is difficult to import. Although foreign rice tax is still being collected as usual, the amount of foreign rice imported is extremely small, and the tax revenue is very low. Shantou is one of the ports with the most foreign imports, but according to statistics, from January 1 to February 26 this year, a period of nearly two months, when Chao-Mei was in dire need of rice, the foreign rice imported by the Chao Customs totaled only over 44,000 dan, and the rice tax collected was only over 140,000 yuan. From this point of view, we can say that the current collection of foreign rice tax can only prevent the import of foreign rice and does not contribute much to the government's financial revenue.</p>
<p>However, some people also say that restricting the import of foreign rice and maintaining the price of domestic rice is to protect the interests of farmers, which is also one of the purposes of the government collecting foreign rice import duties. This view is correct in normal times. Because if foreign rice is imported duty-free, it will be dumped into China in large quantities, making it impossible for the surplus rice in various provinces to be transported to rice-deficient areas, resulting in a surplus of supply over demand, which will lead to lower prices and harm the interests of farmers. But now, in the corner of Chao-Shan, the situation is very different: first, the rice from the rice-producing areas in the country cannot be transported to Chao-Shan due to the * army's obstruction, and the rice price in Chao-Shan has little impact on the farmers in the rice-producing areas; second, the farmers in Chao-Shan do not produce much rice. The harvest of ten parts of tenant farmers and self-cultivating farmers after a year of hard work is not enough for their own consumption. Only a very small number of rich farmers and landlords have rice to sell, and only a very small number of rich farmers and landlords benefit from the high rice prices. It is harmful to the majority of farmers who do not have enough rice for their own consumption. Therefore, taxing foreign rice does not contribute much to financial revenue, and it greatly increases the burden on the people. It not only makes people's lives difficult, but also threatens to cause a rice shortage, putting the people in a state of panic with money but no rice. This is extremely detrimental to the anti-Japanese war of the Chao-Shan people. Therefore, we hope that the government will immediately exempt foreign rice tax!</p>
<p>Exempting foreign rice tax, allowing large quantities of foreign rice to be imported, can certainly prevent the arrival of rice shortages, but it may not be able to stabilize rice prices to improve people's lives. In the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China, in order to maintain the food supply and stabilize rice prices, the Chao-Shan area requested the government to exempt foreign rice import duties, considering the needs of the people, and to limit the quantity and period of tax-free foreign rice imports. As a result, although a rice shortage did not occur, rice prices remained high, and the benefits of tax-free foreign rice fell entirely into the pockets of rice merchants and some corrupt people.</p>
<p>The main purpose of tax-free foreign rice is to prevent rice shortages, so that the people have sufficient food to support the war of resistance, and also to stabilize rice prices, reduce the burden on the poor, and improve people's lives to enhance the strength of the war of resistance. However, merchants are fond of profit and good at profiteering. They collude with corrupt public officials and take all the benefits of tax-free foreign rice away.</p>
<p>Because tax-free foreign rice has a quantity and date limit, rice merchants often hoard a large amount during the tax-free period and do not sell it. Although there is a lot of rice in storage, it feels like demand exceeds supply, and prices are high. After the tax-free period has passed, merchants begin to sell the stored rice, and the price is equal to that of taxed foreign rice. Therefore, in the past two years of tax-free foreign rice, the people have not received any benefit.</p>
<p>The main purpose of exempting foreign rice import tax is to prevent rice shortages, but at the same time, it is also necessary to stabilize rice prices so that the general public can benefit from the tax exemption. The government should not lose foreign rice tax and let it all flow into the pockets of rice merchants and corrupt elements. In the past two years, the Shantou authorities organized an evaluation committee to prevent merchants from manipulating rice prices. However, the evaluation committee was too protective of the interests of rice merchants, and the prices they evaluated were even higher than the prices sold by the merchants. The evaluation committee not only did not restrict the manipulation of rice prices by merchants, but also covered up the behavior of merchants' manipulation. Before strict management of food is achieved, if we follow the old practice and limit the quantity and period of tax exemption, it will not be easy to stop merchants from cheating and achieve the effect of stabilizing rice prices. We believe that the local exemption of foreign rice tax in Chao-Shan should no longer have a quantity and period limit, so that merchants cannot manipulate it, so as to stabilize rice prices and benefit the poor. In the corner of Mei-Chao, during the war of resistance, we are worried about insufficient grain, not surplus grain. The government usually advocates grain storage, but the effect is minimal. Even if the amount of tax-free foreign rice imported exceeds the current needs of the people, in Chao-Mei, where grain production is insufficient, more grain should be more beneficial than harmful. After announcing the temporary exemption of foreign rice, the government can consider the situation and resume taxation when necessary.</p>
<p>To solve the food problem in Chao-Shan, exempting foreign rice tax is only a temporary solution. The fundamental solution should start with increasing production. At this early spring season, we should launch a widespread and enthusiastic spring plowing movement to encourage farmers to increase production.</p>
<p>The first thing to pay attention to when launching a spring plowing movement in Chao-Shan is to eradicate opium, the second is to reclaim wasteland, and the third is to improve farming methods. In the Chao-Shan area, there is a lot of fertile land. Currently, the crops planted are not rice, wheat, or other agricultural crops that are beneficial to people's livelihoods, but poppies that harm the people. In the remote villages of Jieyang, Fengshun, and Puning, there are many fields growing flourishing poppies, and farmers are planting more opium than before the war of resistance. During the war of resistance, in order to cope with the * people's maritime blockade, the requirement for Chao-Mei's self-sufficiency in food has increased a thousandfold. However, farmers are not only unable to increase food production, but are reducing production. The opium that we hate so much is produced more than before the war of resistance. This is a contradictory and painful phenomenon!</p>
<p>In Raohe, Nanshan, Fengshun, and other places, there is still a lot of wasteland that can be reclaimed into fertile land. Expanding the spring plowing movement should vigorously encourage farmers to reclaim wasteland. The county authorities should actively guide farmers to reclaim wasteland and provide them with various conveniences and guarantees, so that farmers can understand the significance of wasteland reclamation and can obtain tangible benefits, and thus be happy to engage in wasteland reclamation.</p>
<p>The farmers in Chao-Shan still use the old methods of farming passed down for thousands of years. Compared with countries with advanced science, our land production is far inferior. Although we cannot learn from industrialized countries and mechanize agriculture, ordinary scientific knowledge such as how to improve fertilization methods and how to eliminate pests in crops can be instilled in the general public, which is enough to make crops grow better, bear more abundant fruits, and increase the amount of harvest.</p>
<p>To resist the enemy's attack, food and bullets are equally important. Today, when the enemy is eyeing Chao-Shan, to solve the food problem in Chao-Shan, we should work hard to do it in a practical way!</p>

<p>Hollywood, how many people yearn for this place name? Every time a new face is discovered on the screen, how many people wonder, where did she—or he—come from? How did they get into the film industry? Why don't I have such an opportunity?</p>
<p>Calm down and read these one hundred and one methods carefully. I dare say that at least one of them is suitable for you. Among these many methods, some require talent, some require courage, and some rely entirely on luck. Pick one that you can do. Who dares to say that you will definitely not be a shining star in the future? Conversely, perhaps these methods will only shatter your dream of becoming a star—but don't be discouraged, read them first.</p>
<p>(1) Put on a formal dress and attend a banquet on a British warship stationed in Santa Barbara—wake up in Catalina the next day and be put on a ship of a film company—tell people that you are determined to devote yourself to Hollywood—then, when you see a certain director who you met once in England, jump out of the car—as long as that director is happy, you have the hope of a screen test. David Niven entered the screen this way.</p>
<p>(2) At the right time, in the right place, dine in a beautifully dressed manner. Wendy Barrie, Sally Eilers, and Maureen O'Sullivan were all discovered in cafes in London, Dublin, and Hollywood, respectively.</p>
<p>(3) Be a descendant of a famous actor. Joan Fontaine and Constance Fontaine, Tyrone Power, Little Fan Pengke, and Ida Lupino all relied on this help.</p>
<p>(4) Grow up in an Italian working-class family—be able to sing like a lark without training—boast of your talent—raise money from the school to go to Hollywood—get a Sunday audition opportunity at Cullo Catelo. LenfLynn got a contract this way.</p>
<p>(5) Learn to make funny faces and strange noises, and then go to Hollywood to perform for people. Rufe Davis did it this way.</p>
<p>(6) Learn to dance as soon as you learn to walk as a child. As long as you learn well, you don't have to worry about being discovered after fifteen to twenty-five years. At least Freya Szu, Eleanor Powell, and Olin White Burrana succeeded with this method.</p>
<p>(7) Be a professional clown and be invited by people in the film industry to entertain guests at banquets. Vfnec Barnett went to the screen by making jokes.</p>
<p>(8) Invent a strange musical instrument, play it at the carnival for eight years, and then play it in a folk art troupe for eight years. Travel through the forty-eight states of the United States, listen to more gossip, and then put on a straight face and tell it to people. Bob Burns made a lot of money with this method.</p>
<p>(9) Enter a school, and the school's drama club sometimes also shoots some amateur films and dramas that are easy for filmmakers to see. This is how filmmakers discovered Antella Reis.</p>
<p>(10) Be a sister of a movie actress. Loretta Young was able to step onto the screen because she was Polly Ann Young's sister.</p>
<p>(11) Know an actress who has the courage to introduce you to a casting director. For example, Lynne Carver knows Polly Ann Young.</p>
<p>(12) Create news that can be headlined in large letters, such as being one of the quintuplets, or flying an airplane to Los Angeles but landing in Ireland.</p>
<p>(13) Follow a famous movie star to Hollywood and then marry him. Elafne Barrie chased and married John Barrymore, and now she is also in the film industry.</p>
<p>(14) Do stunts that stars dare not do. You may not become a movie star, but you have the hope of becoming a star's "double"—like Ione Reed.</p>
<p>(15) If you have never acted before, but an agent mistakenly thinks you are someone else, don't hesitate when asked what plays you have acted in. Give him a quick answer. Learn from Alan Mowbray.</p>
<p>(16) Hold the World Skating Championship and go to Hollywood. If no one notices, you might as well give a performance. This is Sonja Henie's method.</p>
<p>(17) Having a face that is half like Robert Taylor and half like Tyrone Power, Lee Krueger succeeded.</p>
<p>(18) Enter an actor training school. If someone gives you a screen test, don't be like everyone else. Show a nonchalant attitude so that he knows you are not the Hollywood type. June Carlson changed from this incident to Lucy Jones.</p>
<p>(19) Use eloquence to get a job as a screenwriter. Learn a little bit of the "secret of mystery" and apply it in practice. Hedy Lamarr entered the screen this way. One</p>
<p>(20) Marry a drama teacher. Clark Gable's first lady—Josephfne Dfllon—taught him how to act and tried her best to encourage him to try filming a movie.</p>
<p>(21) Be an old friend of someone who is now a Hollywood celebrity. Jack Carson got a chance from his old friend, the great director George Stevens.</p>
<p>(22) Make your singing talent impress the drama critics in your hometown. Let them record your singing and send it to Hollywood. Susanne Larson's road to Hollywood was entirely introduced by her singing voice.</p>
<p>(23) Learn to use a strange voice, completely different from the one you usually use. Then get a puppet and sit on your lap and play some small jokes. Enough, Hollywood will discover you like they discovered Edgar Bergen after seven years.</p>
<p>(24) Keep staring at a talent scout until he gives you a screen test before letting him go. Like Frye McCauley (this method is a bit stupid and requires good patience, but if the other party is more patient than you, I dare say you will fail).</p>
<p>(25) Be a passenger plane pilot on a route where film producers travel the most. If they give you some suggestions for filming, take it immediately, such as John Trert.</p>
<p>(26) Find a drama instructor who guarantees your success and can charge you tuition after you become famous. Marfe Wilson found one.</p>
<p>(27) Be a beautiful sports reporter and follow the sports team to their spring training camp. Many tired talent seekers are recuperating there. This is Ronald Reagen's way.</p>
<p>(28) Having some unique features on your face, like Jamie Duren's big nose, Joey Brown's wide mouth, and Meng Meng's pouty lips.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Shanghai Basketball Fierce Battle: Paramount's Momentum is Gone; Defeated by Mailinghong's Failure <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai News on the 4th) In the West Youth Basketball League, the two heroes of China and the West, Paramount against Mailinghong, met at the basketball hall last night at 9:00 p.m. Since the beginning of the battle, they have won many victories. This game is Mailinghong's last battle. After winning, they will win the championship. Although Paramount still has two makeup games, if they overcome this difficulty, they will also embark on a smooth path and can win the league championship. It is no less than the championship final. Last night, nearly a thousand people watched, and the West Youth was full. After the contact, Paramount took the lead with 9 to 2. Then it became 9 to 9, 11 to 11, and 13 to 13 three times equal. And Paramount again took the lead with 19 to 13, leading by six points. But Mailinghong scored eight points in a row. The first half ended with 19 to 21, Paramount losing by two points. A few minutes after the start of the second half, Cai Yanxiong was sent off. Mailinghong took the lead even more. Paramount worked hard to attack, forcing a 32 to 32 tie. Then it became 35 to 35, and Zhong En was sent off again. The situation changed suddenly. As a result, Mailinghong won with 48 to 40, winning the championship. Paramount's failure was a great pity.</p>
<p>Equally Matched, Suddenly Ahead and Suddenly Behind</p>
<p>The referee was Qu Lv Bolang. Paramount played with two Chen Zhous, Cai, and Lu. Mailinghong played with Mu, Pai, Wang, Sa, and Bo. After contact, the two sides were evenly matched. Mailinghong's five players defended continuously, and Paramount repeatedly failed to attack. Soon after, Bolien fouled, and Xianglong opened the record with a penalty shot. Zhong En and Yanxiong then scored, and Paramount took the lead with 5 to 0. Mailinghong hurriedly called a timeout to frustrate their spirit. Bolien broke the basket, and Xianglong Dayun immediately retaliated. Soon after, Cai Zongxiang Tie fouled, and Bolien made two penalty shots in one throw, forcing it to 6 to 9. Paramount called a stop, and Paerman scored three points in a row, making it 9 to 9. Dayun Muir each scored a goal, making it 11 to 11. Muir Xianglong made it 13 to 13 again. The intensity of the competition can be imagined. After Paramount called a stop at Liu Fang, San Yuan scored three times in a row, but Mailinghong suddenly added eight points. The first half ended with Mailinghong 21 and Paramount 19.</p>
<p>The Main General Was Sent Off, and the General Situation Was Gone</p>
<p>Changing baskets and fighting again, Yanxiong took the lead and hit the bullseye. Bolien immediately won two points. Yanxiong was dismissed with four fouls. Xilin entered the field. Wang Erde was penalized but did not score. Xianglong Zhong En was also penalized. Fortunately, Bolien Wang Erde did not make any achievements. Bo Yao probed the basket and entered the net in response. Seeing that the situation was not good, Paramount called a stop and transferred Xu Wenkui to replace Xianglong. Wenkui was flustered when he came on the court and was attacked by Bo stealing a city. Xilin Zhonghu, Mu broke the basket twice. At this time, Bo's one penalty and one throw were both successful. Paramount also increased by eight points, making it 32 to 32. The two sides were still in a fierce battle. After 35 to 35, Bo made another contribution. There were still five minutes left, and Zhong En was sent off. The general situation was gone. Mai Youliang entered the field and only scored one goal after the opponent scored two goals. After that, Paramount made a major adjustment, but it was useless. Instead, Mailinghong was in high spirits. Before long, the bell rang, and as a result, Paramount was miserably defeated by Mailinghong with 40 to 48. Mailinghong won the championship with a complete victory.</p>

<p>Matters needing attention when teaching ordinary exercises — Zhuoyue Yi</p>
<p>F. Dismissal – Dismissal seems unimportant in normal times, but in fact, we must cultivate students' disciplined habits and the spirit of finishing what they start. Even the smallest things must be regular and cannot be done casually. Because at the time of dismissal, if there is no fixed ritual or good habit, the students will gradually develop bad habits such as sloppiness, casualness, and perfunctoriness. Therefore, at the time of dismissal, there must be a certain ritual and the spirit of the end, such as the dismissal of the army. Before the dismissal, shout slogans (this slogan is about stimulating the spirit and strengthening the will). It can also be implemented in our physical education class, but it is not known whether it is adapted in Hong Kong or not, and it needs to be considered. For example, the boy scouts are used to taking a step back to salute, or turning around after saluting. etc., can be used arbitrarily. It is never possible to dismiss students freely. Now I will give two examples of the habits I usually use.</p>
<p>(1) If it is the time to transfer classes, in order to maintain the quietness of the school, and not to affect the teaching of other classes, it is best to bring the original team to the classroom to prepare for class.</p>
<p>(2) If it is necessary to dismiss the team on the playground, first stand at attention, then step the left foot half a step forward as the first movement, the second movement, buckle the right foot, and the third movement is to clap the hands, which is divided into three beats. It is necessary to strike and sing one, two, three to invigorate the spirit.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned things are ordinary, they are in fact the most important things that ordinary people easily overlook. In addition, regarding the breathing of students during exercise, it should be harmonious with the beat of the action, and there should be no pauses. I urge my comrades to pay attention. (The End)</p>

<p>— Wei Fei</p>
<p>Post-war Hong Kong is overcrowded. Therefore, many businessmen and landlords regard this as a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>Although my time in Hong Kong is limited, I have moved houses many times. From the back room to the front room, from the front room to the middle room, from the bright room to the dark room, from the dark room to the black room, the big ones shrink, and the ones with windows become without windows. You have to turn on the lights to read, and even on a sunny day, you can barely manage for two or three hours at noon. The air is naturally not good, and hygiene is out of the question, but the landlord does not care about these. The rent has increased from four and a half yuan to five yuan two, and five yuan two to five yuan and a half. I think, if I have to move two more times, then, then I will only have to move to the bottom of the landlord's building!</p>
<p>Such a room has no meaning, no sunlight, and no good air. It is always gloomy during the day, and always dark at night. When cooking, the smoke makes tears flow. I am afraid that I will also have to shoulder one in the low units of the number of lung diseases reported in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Since I can't study in the room, I might as well take a walk outside, but every time I step on the pedestrian path, I don't know where to go. Especially in Kowloon, there are no bookstores or companies. Walking from here to there, from there to here, it's like having no home. Wandering, wandering, Hong Kong is indeed lively. People in suits, long gowns, and cheongsams, with their hands clipped, and those with shoulders, shuttle through the crowds. On the road, there are cars, buses, bicycles... coming and going. The number of shops is increasing day by day, and there are too many to see. There are candy companies, Western clothing stores, and European-style cinemas. This road is so beautiful! However, it has become worse day by day. There are two, five—homeless people sleeping on the streets. It's all vulgar.</p>
<p>I panic, afraid that I will occupy a place there, but I calm myself, knowing that panicking is useless. I am still walking, walking the same way, as if drifting at sea. From morning to noon, from noon to night, wandering east and west, from Jordan Road to Nathan Road, from Nathan Road to Shanghai Street, from this side to that side, passing the homeless shelter, many people are waiting there, waiting, preparing to wait for a comfortable night. I sigh. Passing a second-hand clothing store, it is covered with colorful paper strips, all writing, "Closing soon", "Forced to hand over the embroidery". I didn't decide, I sigh. I feel that my ability is only sighing. Looking ahead, I see many people surrounding a half-open silk shop, looking up. I walk closer to take a look. It turns out it's the same again. Everyone is silently reading three pairs of white paper couplets pasted on the wall:</p>
<p>"Money prevails over justice, human affection yields to power"</p>
<p>"The rise of pawnshops is a misery, the fall of golden rain is a joy"</p>
<p>"Borrowing the evil money, using despicable means at all costs, willingly harming the community"</p>
<p>"Taking advantage of a temporary opportunity, only caring about the swelling purse, greed blinds the mind"</p>
<p>I looked at it and there was nothing I could do, I could only sigh.</p>

<p>— Guo Nidi</p>
<p>——Popular Ballad——</p>
<p>The weather was clear on the 23rd, with ten thousand miles of clear sky and no clouds. Not to mention famous mountains and great rivers, just mention the city of Lanzhou. Lanzhou is located in Gansu Province, with access to all directions, and is well-known. It was exactly twelve o'clock noon on that day, the streets were crowded with people coming and going. Suddenly, they heard the wailing of the air raid siren, knowing that the annoying × planes were coming. The shops calmly closed their doors, and the timid citizens temporarily hid in the air raid shelters. The sound of the tracks was faintly heard, and the fuselage could be seen clearly in the distance. In rows of one character and human character, the whole team flew in with vigor. It was like a flock of wild geese in autumn, like dragonflies skimming the water. Count them with your fingers, twenty planes, not half a point off. Our air force was already prepared, and in the blink of an eye, they rose to the clouds and waited in a straight line. Sitting in the plane was a Flying General with a loyal heart. Without waiting for the × planes to get close, they rushed forward like lightning. In an instant, the sound of machine guns was crackling and popping, like firecrackers on New Year's Eve. They showed their skills like magpies rising and falcons swooping, and their power was unparalleled. A fierce battle began, shaking the heavens and earth and making the gods weep. The enemy planes panicked when they saw that we were prepared, and immediately their formation was scattered. They had to parry in a hurry, unable to escape our encirclement. Gloomy clouds were dense and the wind was rustling, the sun was dim and the universe was dark. Suddenly, a loud bang shook the mountains, and an enemy plane caught fire and exploded. Black smoke filled the air and could not be distinguished; a somersault from the clouds fell straight down to the lower world, tumbling and tumbling, like a kite with a broken string turning over and over, burying the dreamer from Sakurajima. Our planes were greatly encouraged, charging and ramming without mercy. The enemy planes had no will to fight, and the generals had no courage, running east and west, thinking of escaping. In another moment, two loud bangs like thunder, two enemy planes also suffered the same fate and turned to ashes. The situation suddenly changed again; each enemy plane accelerated and fled in all directions. Our planes bravely chased after them, the Flying Generals all smiling. One after another, enemy planes were hit and fell to Shili Dun in the east of the city. This time, the enemy planes lost a total of nine aircraft. The world's newspapers shouted together. Gentlemen, listen to me conclude the text. This is called "Great Victory in the Lanzhou Air Battle".</p>

<p>— A Tang</p>
<p>You grow in the bright southern land, your home is on the beautiful southern island. In your soul burns the wildfire of the tropics. Yet, your demeanor is that of a free and quiet palm tree.</p>
<p>You have existed long ago. You will eternally exist, yet I did not notice your existence before.</p>
<p>But we finally met. You gaze at me, your eyes slightly filled with melancholy, but at the same time extremely gentle; the color of your eyes is calm, but at the same time scorching hot, you gaze at me, but I do not notice your existence.</p>
<p>You came across the desolate, vast wilderness; you paused on the railing outside the window, you lingered in the boudoir, you lifted the curtain, and slipped into my hair.</p>
<p>From the haze of dreams, I opened my sleepy eyes and discovered your existence. But I held myself back, to your passionate gaze, I gave a cold glance.</p>
<p>However, when severe winter snow fell, the bitter cold froze my heart, so you came across the desolate and vast wilderness.</p>
<p>When the scorching summer heat burned my heart, so you came across the desolate and vast wilderness again.</p>
<p>When I was tired and wished to die, you brought fragrant flowers, awakening me with their scent.</p>
<p>You travel long distances, you are busy, not for reward or happiness.</p>
<p>You gaze at me, your eyes are melancholic, but extremely gentle, the color of your eyes is calm, but extremely scorching hot, you only gaze at me, and my heart begins to palpitate.</p>
<p>When you came across the desolate and vast wilderness, I was still in a dream. You feared awakening me from my deep sleep, so you silently paused on the treetops outside the boudoir, quietly lingered in the boudoir, gently lifted the curtains and gently slipped into my hair.</p>
<p>When the accumulated snow of winter froze my heart, you gave me warmth, and I felt the spring sun shine, the accumulated snow melt, and spring return to the world.</p>
<p>When the summer sun burned my heart, your gentle breeze brought coolness to my marrow, as if bathing in a clear spring. I no longer suffer from the heat, no longer feel agitated.</p>
<p>I love to hear your footsteps, I still recall your footsteps in my dreams, because they are so soft, and so steady.</p>
<p>I love to hear your voice, I still recall your voice in my dreams, because it is so earnest, so gentle, so low. I love your smile even more. I recall your smile even more in my dreams, because it is so sincere, so heartfelt, so gentle, and so innocent.</p>
<p>I love your eyes, I recall your eyes even more in my dreams, because they are so affectionate, so earnest, but also so pure. They tell me you are a noble soul: they make me think of a pure and flawless baby; they make me think of a holy and sublime angel.</p>
<p>Therefore, I need you, I find peace with you, I want to assimilate with you!</p>
<p>Come across the desolate and vast wilderness! You don't have to hesitate, don't linger, don't pause on the treetops or linger in the boudoir. Come, slip in, and stay in my hair forever.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Country Gentry <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>In our place, there are many, many country gentry. These country gentry, just like reptiles, mammals, and birds in zoology, each has its own common traits, naturally they also have their common traits, which are: not working all year round, but comfortably living in that well-equipped house, smoking opium, playing cards, drinking ginseng soup, and, inexplicably, all officials are always their friends, and are on good terms with them.</p>
<p>For example, let me give you an example of a very reputable country gentleman in our area.</p>
<p>This great country gentleman of ours is not a businessman, he doesn't have a shop in town; nor is he a big landlord, his family only cultivates enough land for two or three dan of rice; he certainly has some sons—born to two or three wives, and those sons certainly hold some small 'official positions', but their income is not enough for their own extravagance; our great country gentleman is certainly not a rich man, people all know that his life was not very good in the past, and he himself, neither went to Nanyang when he was young, nor did he manage any decent business in middle age; in short, our great country gentleman is such a person: neither a rich man, nor seems to have much income.</p>
<p>However, speaking of the future, it is indeed somewhat like a myth—this fact, who can really believe it?</p>
<p>Our great country gentleman lives in an exquisitely ornate, large, and unusually spacious house. He rarely goes to the streets for a stroll, he stays in his house almost all day and night busy with many trivial matters, he has to entertain visiting or local officials—naturally, those banquets are precious, sumptuous, and novel, therefore, he is familiar with many officials, they often lie on the opium bed for most of the day discussing many things we will never know.</p>
<p>His heart is also the most kind and loving, although he has not joined the Jesus Church, he has learned the loving spirit of Jesus, he often receives many strangers with sorrowful faces, and is always so "duty-bound" to take on the burden of eliminating disasters for them, for example, once a woman found him and told him that the police station had arrested a relative of hers.</p>
<p>"She is actually not a prostitute—how could she be?"</p>
<p>"Hmm... hmm..." Our country gentleman nodded, he understood, "That would be a fine of several tens of dollars!"</p>
<p>"But still..." The woman said straightforwardly, "I know everything."</p>
<p>"—Then there is a way," the country gentleman made a phone call to the police chief, "That is my relative, she is not a prostitute—it's really outrageous, who said she is a prostitute?"</p>
<p>So that prostitute walked back to the street again, swaying.</p>
<p>Another time, someone asked him for help with land matters.</p>
<p>"That is really my land, but he insists it is his, he wants to seize it." That person narrated like this.</p>
<p>The country gentleman said nothing, he immediately had a solution in his mind.</p>
<p>"Your place is worth..." The country gentleman calculated the land price and then said, "That's fine, I'll guarantee you'll be alright, you give me the handling fee..."</p>
<p>That place was naturally alright.</p>
<p>There was another time like this—I still want to give another example; a young man who was drafted into the army pleaded with him like this:</p>
<p>"The township head wants sixty dollars from me, where can I get so much, although I have twenty dollars,..."</p>
<p>The country gentleman accepted the young man's twenty dollars, and so the young man was alright, our country gentleman is really such a good person.</p>
<p>His irresistable power can also be seen from the nameplate of his house—"Concession." What is a concession, people who have been to Shanghai naturally know, that is: a place where the government's power does not reach, our country gentleman's house is indeed like this. For example, if our government prohibits smoking and gambling, those who violate the law will have to pay a large sum of money to get away with it. But in our country gentleman's house, it's as if they never knew there was such a prohibition. Every day, all kinds of people rush into his gate like they are going to a fair. His house is naturally spacious, but it also seems unusually narrow because of this, people are crowding, just like in a market, fan-tan, dice, playing cards, mahjong, top-quality opium paste,... all this makes people's minds a little dizzy, but they are relieved, they don't have to worry about the police detectives, because that is a "concession," and, isn't the "banker" in the corner the police chief?</p>
<p>But one cannot therefore say that our great country gentleman is unpatriotic, absolutely not, he is actually very patriotic, although he rarely looks at the newspaper he subscribes to—he almost never reads newspapers, because there are too many words he doesn't recognize, but he often cares about national affairs, and also bought five dollars of national salvation bonds, and, he is also, it seems, a committee member of the self-defense force or something!</p>
<h3 id="e76">In Memory of My Uncle <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— By Anar Wright</p>
<p>Translated by Yuan Shuiyi</p>
<p>(A thirteen-year-old child's poem)</p>
<p>When Ben Wright came into the world, and saw the flag of democracy, he wondered: How long can this flag last? Later he saw the Spanish people, unable to endure the tyranny of the tyrant. He saw that they would have a terrifying king, he saw democracy wandering in the fog, the black curtain of fascism was being drawn tighter and tighter, Ben Wright threw himself into the Spanish revolution. Like every soldier, brave and good at fighting, fighting the fascist devil of Hitler. His friends and brothers were all fighting, he said: "Bullets cannot damage freedom." Even when he died on the battlefield, he still said, "Bullets cannot damage freedom."</p>
<p>(This is a poem written by a thirteen-year-old American child. In memory of his uncle Ben Wright, who gloriously died on the peninsula last year for participating in the Spanish anti-war and like other sacrificed comrades of the International Brigade. "Bullets cannot damage freedom"! The Spanish government, is in the storm, we bless them with these words! - Translator's Postscript</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Snow in Manchuria <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>Then, he smiled at the perpetrator, expressing his intention: whether the bullet pierces his heart, or the blade grazes his neck, he will endure it with the same patience: because he is the son of the motherland, on the altar of the motherland, holding a great sacrifice for the motherland, so he has no sorrow, and no complaint, perhaps he has regrets—for himself, his comrades, the motherland.</p>
<p>However, between success and failure, there are still many conceivable problems; these problems made him hesitate. For example: if he was discovered by detectives before he reached the girl's home, should he quietly commit suicide? Or bravely duel? If that girl who has never been frightened, fainted at the sight of his pistol, lost consciousness, should he drag her away? Or wake her up and then leave? If everything goes smoothly, only at the time of departure, her family's guards block the way, pointing a pistol at him and saying:</p>
<p>"Hey, if you're a friend, please leave our young lady, I will definitely be courteous and let you go..."</p>
<p>At this time, what kind of situation should he enter? Play what kind of unimaginable role? If... In the end, he gave all the questions to his pistol; he believed it could solve everything. However, the principle is not to harm her, because as long as there is her, there will always be an object for this work; even if he is sacrificed, later, there can still be comrades who can replace him in the work.
