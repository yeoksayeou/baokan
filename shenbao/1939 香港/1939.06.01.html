<p>社評</p>
<h3>論×軍五月攻勢的失敗與今後戰局</h3>
<p>×軍日前盛大宣傳其「五月攻勢」，經過我軍這兩週來的反擊，已經完全失敗了。這次戰役，是抗戰第一期結束後進入過渡時期以來具有重大的歷史意義的戰役，我們應該對此有必要的　識，深切的研究，作爲爭取最後勝利的參攷。</p>
<p>×軍的「五月攻勢」是從五月上旬就發動的，據五月十二日×軍宣傳機關同盟社漢口電稱：『日軍發言人今日宣佈日軍在鄂北進行的巨大的剪式運動的戰術計劃，聲稱：華軍十二師團已完全臨于死地。華軍九師已爲日軍鞏敗，日軍似圍北的陣勢將在棗陽東一帶會師，該地離漢口西北約一五零英里』，該社同日同地電訊又稱，「日軍包圍二十師華軍之陣勢已縮成東西長一〇英里，南北長三〇英里之橢圓形。在李宗仁湯恩伯二將軍指揮下之殘餘華軍，後路已斷，現正成千成百，企圖突圍，日軍殲滅華軍九師，現正向棗陽城下包圍前進，棗陽爲第五戰區華軍左　根據地。』會經這樣無恥地誇大地宣傳過的×軍這個『五月攻勢』，主要目的在於運用『坦能　戰　』或所謂「色當戰術」消滅我華中最優秀最精銳的部隊。實行『　陽樊城大進軍』，造成　應豫北晉南×軍進窺關陝的形勢，開　迂迴湘省西北策應湘　邊境×軍打通粵漢全綫的『奇徑。』同時在政治上更可一面緩和它們內部的反戰怒潮，一面挫喪我國上下堅持持久抗戰的精神，而便利漢奸在派等在『和平。反共，救中國』的幌子下進行降服全中國的陰謀。</p>
<p>五月一日起，×軍各路開始總攻，×軍北路於月初攻陷桐柏，十一日攻陷新野，十二日攻陷唐河；企圖向南迂迴，同時×軍南路右翼則攻陷隨縣。棗陽，左翼則由鐘祥北進，越過宜城襄陽。但是×軍北路經我豫南兵團截擊，十七日卽呈潰象、×軍南路右翼第三師團，經我左路軍迎頭痛擊，傷亡甚眾，棗陽隨縣亦先後收復，×軍南路左翼受我河東部隊擊側，惡戰週餘，傷亡數千，至十七日以後，×軍不僅發覺『其園殲華軍二十個師』的計劃已被粉碎，並且×軍自已倒已遭我圍殲了。</p>
<p>據軍委會發表的戰報、此次鄂中之役、斃×二萬餘名，傷者更不計其數，×藤田，藤江，荻州各師團，及小島騎兵旅團等主力部隊，損失過半，×軍兩翼包圍的奸計、已被我完全粉碎，自豫南克新野，唐河，桐柏，鄂北克棗陽、隨縣，襄江克多寶灣，羅漢寺，漁新村，瓦廟集，雁門口，岳口各要地以後，殘×多竄　　　近一帶，連日經我大軍以猛虎搏兔咨態向敗潰之×繼續迫擊，迄廿九日　　　　合國之勢已成，當日拂曉，開始攻擊，一畫夜間，又殲×逾千，×軍這　　中　後據點，已瀕危急，於是武漢之×亦日漸入我控制範圍了、又據指揮鄂北戰事的李司令長官來電，亦稱五月一日以來，×以三個師團一個騎兵旅分三路向我隨，棗，樊進犯正面襄花公路，經我軍連芳軍據堅固工事激戰經句，殲×近五千，其他各路大軍　乘×突進之際，分途合擊、共殲×近萬，×以親彈不權，狼狽囘竄，隨棗相繼克服，此外路透社也完全證實中央社所發『鄂中×軍慘敗』的消息，指出『日軍全綫崩潰』，而×方盟友的宣傳機關海通社亦於二十五日傳出『日軍發言人稱：鄂北日軍已退囘大別山脉以南陣地，並改取守勢』，卅日該社又傳鄂省戰訊稱『前綫沉寂』，『日軍繼續向京山退却』了！</p>
<p>×軍就這樣地自己打了自已的喘巴　自己承認了一切宣傳的誇大與無　！</p>
<p>×軍是怎樣失敗的？第一，我們早在日前社評及「一週間」中指出，×軍目前在軍事上遭　到一種日　嚴重的困難，卽是兵力的不足，交通的險阻，地形的不利，用兵的困難，後方的本虛，這是戰爭進入過渡時期以至相持階段後，×軍遭遇　最普遍也　嚴重的困難，也是日方本身力量所不能解救的困難。『五月攻勢』失敗的主要原因，亦卽在此，今後×軍亦必仍將因此遭遇失敗。第二，由於這些軍事上困難的存在，×軍就很難採取適當的戰略，而這次「五月攻勢」，不僅是句圍綫太長，使上述各困難愈加嚴重，而且他所包圍的又正是作戰形勢完全有利於我的大洪山桐柏山；結果因我運動戰術的活用而使×軍變成包圍了自己！第三，在戰術方面，×人亦犯了維大的錯誤，他們幾乎完全沒有願　到如何解决他　交通　阻，地形不利，後方空虛等困難，因此當它們銳氣萬丈地前進深入之後。當它們近代武器的威力消耗殆盡之後，立刻被我們取得反客爲主的主動的出　，使我們得　一以猛虎搏兔姿態，迫擊潰敗之×！」</p>
<p>我軍怎樣勝利的？誠如中央社三十日重慶電所指出的，「此次作戰、我軍係探取新戰略，實施全面戰　，因此我軍各路成出擊，致使×軍分配於各戰區之兵力絕難活動，而其國內又無可調之部隊，是以×於此次包圍攻犯鄂北，其不能調集更多之兵力，如一期作戰之進犯徐州武漢而進攻襄樊者，其原因卽在此！』這是　個總的勝利因素，不條今日在鄂北取得勝利者在此，卽將來繼續阻止×軍進攻攻準備我軍反爭取最後勝利，亦莫不在此，而汪精衛等以及頑固守舊份子之幾評及咒駡運動戰游擊戰全面戰，可見是只在替日本侵略者說話！至於具體的說起來這次勝利。第一是由於我鄂北豫南前綫部隊善於運動革命的運動戰，善於發展×軍的困難與發揚我軍的優勢，第二，是由於我軍之善於發揮×後戰鬥威力，配合前綫正而作戰，主要的是：（一）漢宜路上我軍不斷予×後方以威脅，（二）平漢路上我軍不斷襲撃武勝關　公山等地以截擊×軍給養輜重；（三）豫南各地我軍與鄂北各軍密切配合作戰，側擊北路進攻的×軍：（四）湘贛鄂邊我軍在陳誠將軍領導下反攻南昌等地，而皖省我新四軍等則同時發展反攻，如包圍合肥等，都足以帝制鄂中之×而協助爭取這次偉大的勝利。</p>
<p>×軍這次『五月攻勢』主要目的是在配合着日×侵華新策略的政治進攻的，牠們企　由『五月攻勢』來鞏固平漢粵漢以東的佔領地區，配合着汪精衛等「和平，反共，救中國」的滅亡中國的政治陰謀，以破壞我抗戰陣綫，以加强其佔領地區的統治，刦掠與壓榨，而準備進一步的征服全中國，以至獨覇東亞！現在鄂北的「五月效勢』雖遭失收，今後同一意義的湘北甚或潮汕的「六月攻勢」也許會繼續佈置與實現，因此，我們更應接受與研究這次勝利的經　與教訓，以加倍的努力，來增加×軍今日的困難，來發　我軍今日的進步，我們要加緊擴大×後的游　戰爭，要加緊　強前綫的戰鬥力量。要加緊戰區與×後的一切政治工作。×軍「五月攻勢」的失敗，己經證明×軍！全盛時代己經過去了！我×勢均力敵，以至×軍開始退化的相持階段快要全面實現了！我們要如緊全民族的團結與堅持持久抗戰，來迎接更偉大的勝利！</p>
<h3>對於中國青年統一戰綫的認識（上）</h3>
<p>— 西安特約航訊</p>
<p>中國靑年統一戰綫已經不僅是必要的和可能的，而且是現實了。</p>
<p>中國靑年統一戰綫有她的特徵。每一個爲中國靑運的統一團結的同志，首先必須認識中國靑年統一戰綫的特後。</p>
<p>中讓靑年統一戰綫是全民族的，是屬於全體靑年的。這使得它與歐美許多國家的形大不相同。在那些國家裏：靑年運動和一般羣眾運動一樣，常帶着人民陳綫的色彩，但是中國的靑年運動却抵抗外×的愛國運動，因此就比在那些國家廣泛　多，中國靑年統一戰綫是長期的。因爲第一　中國的抗戰是弱國對强國的抗戰，不能不是長期的，所以靑年統一戰綫也不能不是長期的，第二，中國靑年統一戰綫僅是爲了抗戰。而且爲了建文三民主難的民主共和國，這更能是一個長期的通程。</p>
<p>中國靑年統一戰線是在廣大靑年羣眾散漫無組織的狀况之下發展起來的。我們不但要去求得巳組織的靑年的統一，並且還要去把幾百萬幾千萬未組織的靑年統一起來。不然我們的統一戰線基礎還是落了空。所以組織無組織的靑年也正是爲了靑年的統一。遭個工作的範圍是廣大的，用一切現有的組織力量去進行，也不會在工作上互相重複的。</p>
<p>中國骨年統一戰線的發展是不平衡的。各階層的政治覺悟和政治力量瓦有高低，以至現在參加統一戰線的靑年主要的只是知識分子，工農靑年雖是擁護統一戰線，但是很少有權利和有可能參加統一戰綿的組織和行動。各地區的政治，軍事，經濟，文化互有出入，對於靑年統一戰線的發展也有很大的影響，有些地方靑年運動已經達到完全的統一，有些地方就差得多，還有些地方，甚至無論什麼靑年團體都不能存在，更不必說什麼靑年統一戰線了。這兩方面的不平衡發展，加上國內國際形勢的千變萬化，使中國靑年統一戰線的發展過程成爲非常曲折和複雜。我們若是不能認識這一點，不能靈活的把握當時當地的具體情况，而只想一步登天，或者只靠千篇一律的公式，就不能不在實際工作中感到失望了。</p>
<p>並且中國靑年統一戰綫還有許多客觀的困難。</p>
<p>過去我們民族各階層各黨派各種族中間長期的尖銳的不和睦還留着一些影響。全國廣大人民和廣大靑年是要一致團結和長期團結的，但是有少數不顧大局，不明大義的頑固份子，或者因爲他們的階級利益和民族利益有了矛盾，或者因爲他們是專靠造謠誣蔑挑撥離間爲生，是專門吃『磨擦飯』的小人，却在處處阻碍着我們。他們想把三民主義偷換爲一民主義，把統一偷換爲××，把抗日偷換爲××××，想把民族團結和靑年團結的事業引到歧途上去。日本　　和他的一些狐羣狗黨，漢奸××親日派，更因此乘虛而入，對於我們靑年相互間的團結，相互間的了解和諒解。定出種種陰謀來進行破　。</p>
<p>過去我們民族長期缺乏民主政治，也有復大的影響。人民和靑年的百分之九十九都不能過組織的生活，不知道什麼叫做組　習慣和組織觀念。傳統的政治，不議羣眾有自己的組織，對於靑年有自己的組織就不喜歡，傳統的政治或者輕視靑年，厭惡靑年或者是懷疑和害怕靑年，而結果總是制限靑年的活動，因此直到現在，還有不少地方靑年活動得不到公開合法的機會、靑年的自由和安全常常缺少最低限度的保障，這些都使我們變無組織的靑年爲有組織，變不平衡的情况爲平衡的工作難於進行。</p>
<p>靑年的生活常常太痛苦了，靑年的教育非常落後，文盲佔極大部分，大部分的靑年每天要十二小時到十六小時的勞動，除了不充分的睡眠以外，什麼餘暇也沒有，就是有了餘　，也不是靑年自己的。工廠工人要求成立抗×後援會，甚至要求受一些政府所規定要受的軍訓，也常常得不到廠方的允許，有些雇主於國難期間在勞動靑年身上大發其國難肘，靑年旣然自顧不暇，要求進行廣泛的團結自然很不容易。</p>
<p>守舊的家庭對於靑年限制也很兇。家長對於自己的子弟尤其是妻女的政策就是不許他們出大門一步，不許他們和外人有接觸的機會，靑年婦女很多處於半奴隸的狀態；在她們還不知人事的時候，緾和足買賣婚姻已經將他們的身體和精神，都緊緊束縛起來了。</p>
<p>靑年自身也有一些弱點。因爲中國是一個落後的國家，靑年運動初期的幹部多數都還是知識份子，他們雖有他們的長處，但在接近農村靑年和軍隊靑年的時候，他們的長處却不容易很快的編出來。又因爲中國靑年受的壓迫太多，所以鬥爭的情緒很高，並且常常走在一般羣眾運動的前面，表現出一種特有的先鋒性：這種先鋒性使我們積極勇敢熱情本來是好的，但是它也可能使我們有時頭腦不够冷靜，眼光不够遠大，因而趨於極端。</p>
<p>充分的認識中國靑年統一戰線的這些特徵和困難，對於我們的工作非常重要。只有這樣，才能眞正堅定我們的信念，堅持我們的方針，打破障碍而找到出路。我們現在可以預見到我們前進的速度暫時在全國的範圍內，必然不能普遍的大，我們前進的道路必然是崎嶇曲折的，我們將不免要受到一些挫折，遇到一些逆流，但同時我們也可以偵見到我們靑年的全民族的和長期的靑年統一戰線的遠景必然是勝利的。</p>
<p>但是我們的任務不能止於口種預見，我們必需研究這些特徵和困難的中國靑年統一戰線的發展法則：我們必需掌握己往的一切經驗教訓，以便我們更會得適應今天的具體情况，更能够順利的展開工作。</p>
<p>我們的經驗教訓有以下幾方面：</p>
<p>第一，統一戰綫工作的基本原則，就是要眞正忠實於國家民族的利益，要眞正做到『抗日高於一切，一切服從抗日。』凡是抗日的靑年我們都要一視問仁，凡是抗日的事業我們都要參加，因爲這樣才於抗日有利：凡是反對團結的靑年我們都要說服，凡是破瓌團結的行爲我們都要拒絕，因爲這樣才於抗日有利。在工作中間我們也會發生爭執，那時我們應該怎樣呢？要是讓步了於抗日有利，我們應該讓步的：要是讓步是超出於抗日有利的範圍，削弱了抗日的力量，我們應該堅持我們的立楊。</p>
<p>第二，爲了抗日的利益，統一戰線的內部必需互相尊重，互相帮助，互相發展。只看見自己，不看見旁人，只顧自己單獨發展，不讓大家共同發展，這樣的統一戰線是不可能的，抗日需要加强全體的力量，不是要剜了肉來補瘡，劃了左手添到右手上去。</p>
<p>在有一地方的有些學校裏少數同學組織了一種團體，今天打傷幾個教員，明天趕走幾個同學，鬧來鬧去，大家卽使怕它了，却始終不佩服它，不同情它，它發起的時候有多少人，過了一年半載還是多少人。</p>
<p>反過來說，如果彼此謙讓互助眞誠友愛，那末彼此就都得到益處。有臺個小學校裏曾經有兩個意見不和的教員，一個人主持一個夜校。第一個夜校的學生很多，第二個夜校裏却是一個學生也沒有。主持第一個夜校的教員這時就把他那裏的學生自動帶到第二個夜校裏來和主持這個夜校的教員合作。以後這兩個教員的感情就完全融洽起來，他們的夜校也蒸蒸日上了。這雖是一件很小的事情，却包含着很大的眞理。</p>
<p>第三，爲丁抗日利益，統一戰綫必需力求出於自覺自顧，出於民主，而不能採取強硬的手段，各個人有各個人的思想信仰，各個團體也有各個團體的特殊歷史和特殊地位，不願意忽然無條件的歸於消失，幾偭團體用適當的方法互相合併，固然是可以增加力量，但如方法不當，使有些團體感覺到不是自動而是被動，不是合併而是吞併，這就只有毀滅國家民族的寶貴元氣，愈要增加力量，力量反而愈減少了、愈要統一靑年，靑年反而愈不統一了。比如一個互不了解的男女，原來是可以逐漸了解的，若是强迫他們結婚，他們就只有整天的互相反目，一有機會，他們還是要離婚的。（大笑）</p>
<p>第四，統一戰線的建立是一個過程。普通要實現組織的統一，常常要從行動的統一開始，西安，廣州，溫州各地靑年運動的經騐都證明一個具體的日常行動上的統一要比一切空洞的形式上的統一更有效些，</p>
<p>上海暨南大學的同學曾有一個很長的時間是在分裂的狀態裏·綏遠抗戰的時候，有一部分同學發起爲前方將士募捐寒衣，募捐運動先由校長開了頭，接着全校師生都參加了，於是一個統一的保管委員會組織起來了。還個運動後來發展成爲全校的一日一枚運動，而且一直影響到全上海市。　（未完）</p>

<h3>久別了的宋希濂將軍</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者雅</p>
<p>從××地，乘着一部特殊的軍用車，在一個被黑　所統制着的夜晚、好像瞞天過海似的，到達了隴海路附近的××縣。「八一三」滬戰時的抗×名將宋希濂將軍，統率着健兒，不　不響地正在這裏養精蓄銳，等待若反攻時期一到，他將像神龍似的一躍而出，把×人迻出國境之外。</p>
<p>記者就在這樣的一個黑夜裏，會着了由三十六師師長晉升爲××軍軍長的宋將軍，他先敘述了滬戰以後的行踪。次言及國際情勢。最後以對戰局樂　而興奮的語句，結束了談話。</p>
<p>『八一三滬戰後，』他陷於往事的憶想中了：一我辭別了那些用自己的血肉，換取了×人的生命，戰死在沙場上的同志，領着兩千多名身經百戰的弟兄，去到南京補充和訓練。當我們補充訓練完畢，準備着重上前線的時候，×人的鐵蹄已瘋狂地向南京猛進了！此時我們便加入保衛南京的戰鬥，在連天的炮火下，和　×血戰了八天！</p>
<p>『南京棄守後，我的部隊到了江西，先從事整理，嗣北閒徐州，在李宗仁將軍的　揮下，參加了合兒莊的殲滅戰。接着就衝到了湖北的麻城，在保衛武漢的大會戰中，與暴×血戰了五十天！以後便到了河南南陽從事整理後，才開到此地來。囘想八一三滅戰時的弟兄，現在已完全升了班長。</p>
<p>『在南京戰鬥中，我的部隊裏有一個班長被×人所俘，與其他友軍的將士一起，被×人押至一塊空地上，用機關槍掃射。　班長很是機警，×人機觀槍一響，他就裝作飲彈而斃的樣子。停了有兩個鐘顯之久，他偷偷地拾起頭來想逃走，誰知看守的×人還沒有離開那兒，因被×人在身上殺了兩刺刀，他一聲不響裝做死去了。到了晚上，他按緊了自己的創口。從血肉糢糊的死屍堆中逃歸部隊，已升了連長。他當常爲新來的弟兄講述自己脫險的故事，及×人的殘暴情形，因此弟兄們都有共同信念：「縱然被包圍，也只有戰死，俘虜是做不得的！」</p>
<p>『弟兄們在每次戰役中，都是英勇無匹的。特別是在富金山一役，把×人的第十三師團打得一個落花流水！被我們殲滅及殺傷的×軍在四千以上，並且還打傷了他們一個旅團長。現在我們每一個老兵的身上都有着一兩件由×人那兒得來的勝利品。</p>
<p>『由歷次的戰門中，我看出×人的戰鬥能力及精神，是一天比一天低落，一次比一次衰敗，直到最近×人的攻擊鋒芒，常被我們到處莜斷。我們的軍隊，技術和武噐雙方面都進步了，僅由這一點直感，就足够使每一個中國人對抗戰前途覺得樂觀而又興奮。</p>
<p>『說到國際問題，目前最顯著的是德意等全能國一步步向英法逼得更厲害了，英法已是到了退無可退的地步，所以世界大戰遲早總得　發。在歐戰爆發後，中國所處的境地也許要艱苦一點，但這是在中日戰爭中一個不可避免的過程。不過我們知道現時的戰爭是經濟的戰爭，英美援助我，一方面固然是我們打得好，給別人看得起，認爲是值得帮助的一個民族；另一方面也是因爲中國土地肥沃，礦產豐富的原故，如果我們的國土是一片沙漠、那麼英美就沒有帮助我們的必要了。所以我們只要努力開發資源，穩定貨幣，以我們這樣一個人力、財力，物力充足的國家，與那樣一個地少，人少，財力窘迫的國家作戰；只要我們萬眾一心，戰勝×人是有把握的。至于×人在我們的土地上作戰，任其鐵蹄蹂躪，給我們以種種的痛苦困難，那是不要緊的；歐戰時德國的軍隊也曾在法國士地上作戰，等到終了，因爲德國的經濟崩潰，他不得不一收塗地的退出了法國土地，最後得到勝利的還是法國。』</p>
<p>辭別了宋希濂氏，卽至離此間數十里之××村，參觀在那兒訓練的機械化部隊，將近××村時，一路上只見坦克車多如蟻聚之爬虫，來往奔馳，記者感到無限的驚奇與興奮！反觀來往村民，咸皆視若無賭，像上海居民對汽車的疾駛而過沒有任何感覺一樣，原來他們已是司空見慣了。記者旋卽趨前普謁談隊負責人，並與之作長談、然所談者大多有關軍秘，未便公然發表、但有一語可爲讀者道及，卽：待第三期——反攻時期開始時，所有精兵及機械化部隊，將巾躍于全國各戰場上，向着敗北的×人猛襲，一直把他們趕下鴨綠江去！</p>

<h3>河內視察記</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>（續五月三十日本版）</p>
<p>『（罔咯通訊）汪精衛與××××，妄生和議，背叛黨國于先、桃撥離間于後，在國人　起圍攻中、走避河內，且有出爲傀儡準備，現汪×指使爪牙，四出活動，收買言　機關，亂倡主和論調，藉以靈惑同胞，遂其私慾。日昨本京各大商號，突接到一藍色小册子，名爲：「汪副總裁最近言論集，附名流學者和平意見，桂林國際評論社發行」。此種小册子，顯然是汪×爪，所編印，其謂在桂印刷者，完全係欺入之詞。蓋現在之廣西，斷難容汪×爪牙活動其間。其所以分寄僑商者、莫非在混淆視聽，蠱惑僑胞、該小册子內容文字有「副總裁主張言和某主歌從近衛內閣到平沼內閣，華僑領袖張水福響應汪副總裁和平之意見。注先生離渝前曾訪蔣力陳和戰利害，和平運動有普遍趨勢、和與戰，國民黨止副總裁宣告分裂。和與戰之中國　史觀」等，各篇內容均荒　絕倫，讀之令人作嘔，僑胞愛國情緒，向極高昂，擁護抗戰、擁護最高領袖、始終如一，决非汪×隻言片語听能蠱惑，故一般人于接到該小册子後，于情怒唾駡之餘，卽予撕毀。最可怪者，該種小册子，並非在香港直接寄來，而係在本京寄出者，因小册子所貼者爲暹國二分郵票，顯然係大帮運咯後，由此間汪×黨徒或×奸代爲分寄。誠可惡之極，此種含有毒素之汪×言論，願僑胞應予注意，勿爲所愚。」</p>
<p>海外僑胞的捐輸救國，對于祖國抗戰建國的前途。有决定的影響。今汪×及其爪牙們仍變本加厲，在海外　惑僑胞，身居與論界的我們，不能不鄭重地指出，請求嚴重注意這個問題，並設量切實的其體對策。</p>
<p>其次，記者仍有不得已于言者，記者于二月初留港時，卽曾聽到×人對安南頗有野心行　之風聞，二月廿八日在重慶曾聽到日本東京中央廣播電台的播音，大意謂安南土人對法之壓迫，甚爲不滿，時刻有發生民族獨立運動之可能云云。故記者此次越南觀察，對于這點，亦頗注意。据說×收賣越人，桃撥越人與法人，越人與華人之惡感，不　餘力；數週前，曾有過一次風傳，謂越人擬暴　屠殺華人，被巡捕房發覺，　取必要的措置，始告無事，然到底有二華人在郊外被殺云云。但記者未偵確實證據，未敢斷言。除此而外，×人妄造進攻越南謠言，動搖人心，使一般人民，多存現銀，致影響西　紙每元須姑水一二仙，有時甚或超過此數（在海防見到此現象）。進攻越南，固爲毫不足　的無稽謠言。但×人玩弄其一　的毒辣手段，挑撥離間，動搖人心，造成恐怖，搔亂金融，則是已見的　實，對于這一切，我們相信我們的友邦，　明的法國政府必已有必要得對策：賢明的　南人士，亦必不會為×人所欺騙與蠱惑，但望我們　越僑胞，事事須格外小心謹慎，以增進中法中越友誼增厚抗戰力量。</p>

<h3>「婚」在香港</h3>
<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>婚在香港，形式不一，有坐花轎的舊式結婚，有坐汽車的「文明結婚」，有宗教儀式結婚，也有『臬署簽字』的　冊婚，交代淸楚，下便逐個來談。</p>
<p>舊式婚有「文定」，「行聘」俗稱「過大禮』和「親迎」三部曲。「文定」是定婚的儀式，舉行時離結婚日子遠近不一定，有的定了婚一兩年然後結婚，也有定婚一兩個星期後便結婚的。</p>
<p>「文定」的儀式是由男家方面辦備禮餅，豬，酒，菓品，檳榔，靑等禮物和金飾一二件送往女家，女家便把衣料飾物，「茶脚」，和取其『好意』的薑，藕，芋，等答囘，禮物數量多少視門戶貧富而定。</p>
<p>上面說過的「茶脚」是一種「術語」，牠句括煎唯，鬆糕，「大發」——糕之一種——飽子，糖餅，和油炸的食品。</p>
<p>「過大禮」是最隆重的搬送禮物儀式——乾，坤兩宅，變方言語的禮物數量，像酥餅若干担，酒若干壜豬若干担，京　若干，海味若干，生菓若干，洋酒若干，……都要如數奉上；倘若有些差少，那末吵鬧免不得，說不定「親家變了冤家」。</p>
<p>禮餅的名目很多，屬於酥餅的有：紅綾，白綾，黃綾，燒鷄，皮蛋……，其餅還有龍　餅，　仁餅，雞蛋糕……最平的要二十塊錢一担，貴的四十多塊錢一担，洋酒，海味：「早晚時價不同」。</p>
<p>禮餅，果品都用圓餅盆載好，放在食箱上，用人佚抬了，浩浩蕩蕩，送到女家。</p>
<p>「年生庚讀」的禮書，金鐲，戒指和一切貴重飾物，「聘金」還是行聘的主要東西，不過官有人家多不購聘金多少的，因爲恐人家笑他們「賣女」；祇任乾宅封來便了；有的封來也不受的，經濟是打倒舊禮教的勁軍，近年來，爲着節省人伕「力金」，很多人都用運貨汽車，輸運禮物。</p>
<p>女家收過禮物，也用「茶脚」囘禮，抱褂料，鞋，帽，……贈書當然是主要物。</p>
<p>「大禮」過了，普通多在三五七天內舉行婚禮，在婚禮舉行的前夕，女家要把「嫁粧」搬過往男家，嫁粧多少是個貧富問題，普通都是房裏傢私，應用被褥，衣服……富人們都要「行嫁粧」，一本「粧奩錄」成尺厚，自「廳面」的酸枝檀　，沙發餐檯，麻雀檯，銀器，錫噐，房內的粧檯，小沙發，鴨毛被，金山毡，一切零星什物，珠寶金飾，一直倒馬桶，担杆，柴刀，火鉗，甚至鹹魚，梅菜也得列入。成副吹打導送，在馬路上半小時也未過完。</p>
<p>「親迎」之日，花轎是主要的東西，花轎的租值，等級很多，最廉的紅緞轎要五六元，翠轎六七元，頭號電燈翠轎却要十　二十多塊錢。倘若要八名抬轎的轎佚穿着紅色制服，每名又要加工資一元。</p>
<p>花轎之外，儀仗採用，貧富不同，簡單的祇用一頂花轎一對燈籠，一班「馬步吹」，所謂「四吹六拾」——（卽四人吹打鼓樂，六人抬轎）——的便是</p>
<p>有錢的却要多用『大樂』，燈龍也要兩對以上，『糖山』，『花炮』，翠亭，笨燈，羅傘，寶扇……所費非一百幾十元不辦。</p>
<p>更富有的，便弄得來出會景似，「馬」，『飄色』，僱用女童，扮成古人騎着馬兒前導，又扮成成班宮娥後擁裝成什么『天姬送子』『銀河相會』等俗劇景色，用人抬着巡行：翠亭，雙翠，單笨，軟翠，五光十色，大吹大擂，儀仗延長里許，行人站立道傍觀看，一小時才看得完。</p>
<p>除了上說三部曲外，還有其他「上頭加冠」，三朝新女壻上廳謁祖，三朝送燒豬囘門……等，繁文耨節，寫出來便成一本書。</p>
<p>請酒也是一個主要節目，男家頑張的要一是日薄酌」「翌日梅酌」，大宴親朋兩天：女家也要大請「喜酌」。</p>
<p>「文明結婚」是封建社會沒落。資本社會崩潰中產生的省事省錢的結婚儀式。</p>
<p>簡單的只用一架汽車，扎上「某府迎親」的生花牌，從男家駛到女家，把新娘接囘來，便算喜禮告成。晚上至多擺幾桌酒歡宴一下戚友便了。一套證婚人致詞，主婚人致詞，來賓致詞，換戒指發結婚登書，茶會護照……的把戲，更富有的却要開香檳，跳探戈舞，來賓中：長袍馬褂，花裙大褂的有人，燕尾禮服，輕紗軟緞的有人，人與物都中西合壁，「傻，多，多，多；傻，你至，多，……」的洋八音的「結婚進行曲」也要奏得響亮。</p>
<p>說道結婚禮堂和茶會，中上的酒店要簡堂租廿元，茶點每客七毫，高貴的酒店，禮堂免租，茶點每客一元，香檳，樂隊，生花裝點另計。</p>
<p>文明結婚，雖然不少人穿長衫馬褂；有的甚至　起背后　　的西服獵裝也來，有的却要穿燕尾大禮服，拿高相，這種禮服高帽，造起來很破費，洋裁隨非二三百元不辦；國人裁縫也要百多元；好在「結婚禮服出租」巳經很多戶，燕尾禮服，高帽，襯衫，一切零件包括，每天租價不過十三四塊錢，新娘的白緞禮服，頭紗，手套，每天租價不過七八塊錢罷。</p>
<p>宗教儀式，結婚是在教堂舉行：香港，及九龍，天主教和基督教教堂領有發結證婚書執照的，一共有三十多間；他們給人行婚禮後，例需呈報政府結婚註册處備案。</p>
<p>宗教式和文明婚差不多，不過儀式是由牧師或神父主持罷。</p>
<p>宗教式也要花錢的，打一打動聽的婚鐘便要破鈔廿五洋。</p>
<p>「果署簽名」的註冊結婚，是很單簡的，祇要向註冊署登記，由註册官把男女學方姓名住址，職業，在高級法庭婚姻註册處公佈，兩星期後便可舉行結婚，登記費祇一元，倘若外急不及待，那末你可以討取持別許可證，隨時可以行婚禮，不過特別許可證要繳費五十元的。</p>
<p>在註冊處行婚禮要繳費十元，儀式祇有由註册主任，新郎，新娘，和兩個見証人共署婚證便了。</p>
<p>事情雖然這樣單，不過常有的人，往往在註册處登記後，還要在酒店禮堂再來一套茶會跳舞，晚上又要在酒館，開筵大宴賓客的。</p>
<p>除了上面說過的各種形式外，「集團結婚」，靑年會也曾舉辦過，成績也不錯，後來，「七七事發」他認爲國難嚴重，便停止舉辦，却不知去年到現在，本港結婚宗數反　增起來。（明天：喪在香港）</p>

<p>壽險理論</p>
<h3>人壽保險與生命價值</h3>
<p>— 王蘊玉</p>
<p>何謂人壽保險？</p>
<p>人壽保險者，乃一種準備階曾以賠償一般出資者，因死亡，殘廢以及衰老所遭遇之經濟損失之法則也。從社會一般立論，人壽保險爲積聚資金，以賠償死亡損失之社會方策，此種危險之責任由個人或少數人轉嫁于衆人共同担負之。從個人一般立論，人壽保險乃由一方，即投保人數被一定之保費，倘死亡或一定之事情發生，他方，卽保險公司賠償投保人或其指定之受益人以所保之金劃之一種契約也。</p>
<p>何謂生命價值？</p>
<p>世界上之價値，大的可分爲二種：卽財產價值與生命價値是也。財產價值係一種有形的，如房屋，田地，貨物等之屬子物質，而可顯見其價値者。生命價値則係一種無形的，如個人之技能，學識，操行等之屬于人事，而其價値乃爲無形者也。生命價值爲創置財產價値之原素，無生命價値卽無財產價値，故生命價値實較財產價，尤爲重要。如房屋被焚，固可使家主及其家屬感覺不便與困苦：但其人若繼續生存而得工作，則不久背幣之損失司以補價，而能重建房屋。反之，若房屋未被焚毀，而家主云亡，則其生產能力永遠喪失矣，况生命之損失，遲早必有一日，其發生乃屬必定，而財產之損失，或永不發生，卽發生之期亦甚遠也。生命價值，就吾人平時收入能力所表現者而觀，乃爲一種資產，實與實際財產無異，但世人不察，多知財產之價值，故對于財產保險視爲當然，如房屋，機器，船隻，房車，貨物等，皆保火險或水險，以爲之保障，使一旦遇有水火等危險，而遭損失，可向保險公司取得賠償，對於無上價值之生命，則往往忽視，不思有以保障。而彌袖其損失，實有未明人壽保險之功用也。</p>
<p>壽險對于生命價值之保障</p>
<p>人壽保險乃以處理人類生命之經濟價值爲目的。財產閃水火之危險而遭損失，固經投保水險或火險，以為保障，人類生命價値亦恆因死亡危險，而受摧毀，尤須投保壽險以爲保障，使家庭之依靠者，免因投保人之死亡，以致生產能力消滅，而受經濟上之根失。故人壽保險最大之目的，乃在保障投保人之生命因身體摧毀而生產能免遭全部或永久損失之危險，計種危險并不能投保人宣吿經濟死亡。下列三種危險即爲宣吿經濟死亡之原因：</p>
<p>（一）壯年天亡</p>
<p>（二）身體殘廢</p>
<p>（三）老年無依</p>
<p>壯年夭亡卽是在生產明內死亡之謂，此種危險在經濟上之重要，較諸財產遭遇水火之危險，更爲嚴重。而人之生命價值，在無論何時，皆有罹此危險之可能。身體殘廢與老年無依，雖生命尙存，然工作能力，均已消滅，無有生產，惟有繼續爲消費者而巳，故雖生猶死也。</p>
<p>上述三種危險之嚴重，顧非有一種保障以資防堞不可。人壽保險即爲保障此種危險唯一最妥當之辦法。蓋吾人如保有壽險，則在生產期內夭亡，則所保壽險可作為家庭未來產業，使有賴者不至匱乏。如年老退休而投保人仍然生存無憂。則所保壽險可爲自己防老之儲蓄款項。又如投保人遭遇全部殘廢，亦有相當收入，並免其此後續檄保費，保險契約繼續有效，直至死亡時，作為身後家庭之生計</p>
<p>生命價值之估價及保額</p>
<p>生命價値高于財產價値以及人壽保險對于保障生命價值之重要，巳如上述。茲此而言生命價值之估價及其應行保險之金額。生命價値既爲生產能力之資本化，則與財產同爲一種資產。今資產價値之估價巳成爲普遍之現象，則對于較大價値之生命，若作同樣之處理，乃屬當然之事。依照許多學者之意見，均認爲一個家庭之保額，須按通常投資馧舉之本金所得之收入，足興家庭在投保人生前進狄中除去投保人自己所屬部分相當，例如投保人每年之處投為六千元、計中半數，即三千元，乃充家屬難艱之體。如按年息五厘計算，則其本金應爲六萬元。換言之，卽應投保六萬元，則每年可繼續有三千元之收入作爲家屬之膽養費矣。</p>
<p>此種計劃爲為瞻養身後家屬一般良好之法則，但各人家庭之大小不同，收入不同，其所依賴於家長保險之保陣，亦各有別。如未屆自立年齡之兒童數目若干，永難自給之依賴者之有無，敎育基金之需要與其他投資之數目及爲性質，均爲决定保險金額之條件。總而言之，家屬之經濟幸福，實爲家長者首應計劃之問題，吾人若不藉人壽保險以作適當之保障，則對于此種當前之最大經濟危險，不啻行險，以圖僥倖，不智孰甚。世界著名壽險專家，漢伯納氏有云：「為家長者如無大宗恒產，而又不保壽險以保障其依賴者，使免受其自己生產能力損失之痛苦，則其行爲與犯罪相去無幾矣。」</p>
<p>壽險問題</p>
<h3>自殺與壽險公司責任問題</h3>
<p>— 孔滌菴</p>
<p>險中之死亡保險係以被保險人之身故，爲保險公可給付賠款之條件，換言之，被保險人死亡後，保險單中指定之受益人，始能向保壽公司領取賠欵是也。但致死之道其多，苟死亡之原因，出於受益人之謀害，法律如仍允其有領收賠欵之權利，則非但被保險人隨時隨地將惴惴於生命之危附，而其影響所及，社會將視投保壽險爲畏途，而裏足不前矣。因此受益人故意致被保險人於死亡，在刑法上固當課以殺人罪之嚴刑，在保險法上亦斷不許其有領受賠欵之權利也。</p>
<p>惟被保險人死亡之原出，並非由於他殺，而於自殺，斯時壽險公司之責任如何？實有深切研究之必要。</p>
<p>自殺係以絕滅自己生命爲目的，故意自加戕害之一種行爲，其非以戕害生命爲目的，縱令其行爲之結果足以讓成死亡之危險，並不得謂之自殺：故自殺之要件，須以意　思之存在為前提。倘本無自殺之意思，出於偶然的過失而喪身者，如藥劑師因化驗毒品而斃命，飛行家因練習失事而殉職，固不得視作自殺；即因心神喪失人事而致之之死亡亦不得謂之自殺。</p>
<p>自殺之發生，有出於偶然者，有蓄諸已久，一朝勃然發生者，其動機有悲時身世，感偽過甚者，有俯仰愧怍，爲避免精神的苦痛者，不問其原因之如何？要之旣出於自己之意思，皆得謂之自殺。至於因暫時精神上之障碍，或激於倉皇之義俠，如銘酊過甚，誤弄繪機，孺子入井，躍水抖擻，以致不幸犧牲性命者，非出有意，自非自殺。</p>
<p>自殺與他殺，雖其致死之原因，截然不同，而結果則一，故依我國保險法第六十六條規定保險公司均得免除給付賠欵之責任。</p>
<p>惟不出自殺原因之出於故意與否，槪許壽險公司得免付賠欵，衡以公平之法理，似又欠妥當，故我國保險法中，僅規定故意之自殺，保壽公司始得主張免除責任焉，所以然者，蓋恐被保險人因營業倒閉。或受重大刺激，蓄意自殺，而又慮死亡以後，妻寒兒號，生活無着，特預向保險公司訂立終身壽險契約，以爲遺族安全之計，如此可知被保險人己早存自殺之念，保險公司爲保護本身利益起見，當然得於保險單中挿入非在訂約經過若干時後之自殺，不負賠款義務之條款也，但被保險人雖畜意自殺，而自殺之意思，决無歷久不變之理由，故我國保險法第六十條第二項又規定保險契約，壽過二年，（按英國保險法規定一年），被保險人因自殺而死亡者，保險公司仍負給付賠欵之實任也。</p>
<p>被保險人之自殺，保險公司雖可免除賠飲，而保險費之計算，因以平準主義爲標準，卽投保人於契約期是內，自始至終，每年繳納同額之保費，是訂約切期所給付者，實超過被保險人實際年齡所應繳之數，此超過部分之保險費績存金，原爲被保險人預付之金額，而爲其應有之權利，故自殺結果之保險契約雖屬無效，而保險法第六六條第一項但書，特規定保險費積存金仍須返還於被保險人也。</p>

<p>健康常識</p>
<h3>便秘與疾病</h3>
<p>— 李浩田</p>
<p>便秘爲不良習慣之結果、在都市居住之人、其發生比其他疾病爲多、故曰文明之疾、便秘爲百病之原、能影響全身各器官之康健、幸而時至今日、智識界多已明瞭此爲傷身之蟊賊、</p>
<p>便秘之習慣多成于早年、不習之母親、每在無意中使子女要成此惡習慣、爲母者因繁於應付其子女之天性要求、每令他等對于大便强力制止、所以當其進校之時、不敢請小假出外、迨已長成、因社交環境、長途旅行或公事太忙、而强力制止大便之需要、凡此鐘種均爲便秘習慣之所由來、</p>
<p>吾人每日進食三次、大便一次爲最理楊之常規。惡習慣能使人發生生理之變態，飢則思食，倦則思眠，此習慣也。食睡不依時則發生胃病吳失眠病，而療治之最良方法，並不求助於藥，而求於早眠與定時進餐而已，由此觀之，欲治便秘，亦同一例，應以好習慣治惡習慣。大自然能使人收自種之果，便秘其惡習乎？</p>
<p>便秘之結果：直腸爲體內殘餘物質之總匯，惡毒之氣由此而生，其不濕之水份每由此間被吸入血液，而生下列病狀：頭痛，頭量嘔吐，胃痛，胃口消失等。至於疾病之發生則有下列：風溫，骨節炎，神經炎，扁桃體炎血管便等種種。不良之食物亦能發生使秘，而消失乙種維他命之白米，不宜于食。乙種維他命爲營養神經之原素，使一旦消失或減少，則胃腸之蠕動減，而使胃腸之力弛。便秘之自療：（一）食物之選擇，如蔬菜，粟類，水菓，多爲輕瀉劑。（二）多飲永爲防止便秘之良去，每日官飲八至十杯或每早餐前砍二三杯。但此習慣宜漸爲之，從以冷沸水爲宜。（注意餐時飲水則不甚相宜）。（三）藥劑若常服之，則不宜，然當久患便秘，偶一爲之亦無不可。瀉藥與其他刺激性瀉劑不宜多服。礦油較爲安全，直腸灌洗，難以常常施行，但當便秘太久之時，亦可偶一爲之。（四）這動，能令肌肉增强，如打球，散步，騎馬等。</p>

<h3>莫愁前路無知己　球國誰人不識君　南華隊踏上征途　昨一行十九人乘廣東號南駛　譚振輝江干送別忽變作征人</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）「滿船離別恨、風雨送征人」別是一番滋味在心頭、</p>
<p>昨天午前、毛毛雨下個不停、那三番更改行期的南華南征足球隊、卒於昨天午後四時、乘長風破萬里浪、向天南進發、</p>
<p>這次遠征人選、經莫慶軍師仔細思商、點出二十名好漢、</p>
<p>二時半、冒雨跑往皇后碼頭歡送的、有球人們的家屬戚友、及會中幹事多人、但、我瞧瞧送行隊裏、却少了「陸叔」一人、此老素具熱腸、南華每次出征、必見他送往迎來、可是這次却成例外了、</p>
<p>不聽聞「Come　on　South　China」的呼聲、未知球人們作何感想、聽說此老爲了兒子隨征無緣、有點不高興、</p>
<p>「胖子」周幹事、姍姗來遲、點過了隨征名單、莫軍師跟着趕到、左關右顧、忙個不了、</p>
<p>譚振輝落第後、深歎無緣、昨天悄悄地混在歡送人羣中、一言不發、確是難過、可是、「天無絕人之路」、周胖子忽得到莫軍師面援機宜、臨時准許振輝隨征、這麼一來、眞令他啼笑皆非、</p>
<p>振輝對我說、「莫軍師眞神機莫測、我現在白手空拳踏上征途、連內衫褫也沒有、眞狼狽、」</p>
<p>李滇友「波監」未滿、有行不得也哥哥之喚、祗到歡迎人家一程、但當一般送行人們了「廣東」輪的時候、碩友却未動身、還留在輪中、如此這般、可想觸得之</p>
<p>卓石金的「大人」、借同石金的妹妹同來送行，惜別依依、惹人注目、眞有「柳絲槃得吾郎住、願向江頭種兩行」的感慨、</p>
<p>在小輪中、石金對我說、「今日這般浪大、廣東號不是巨洋輪、出到海外、必不免有吐浪之苦」、他的太太聽了、偷偷瞧地他一眼、有點關懷、</p>
<p>我和郭英祺開玩笑、問他「這囘南遊、要吃幾碗飯」、他說、「現在不行了、肚子也還有站微痛、吃飯成續、已不比以前那麼可觀了」、</p>
<p>馮「二歲」縱開小輪、踏上廣東號的夾板上、却發覺遺下了一個小皮囊、未幾、由謝錦洪拿到來、物交原主、二叔感激之餘、謂至少給他一元茶資、但結果二叔說出做不出、</p>
<p>梁榮照因爲事務太忙、還未幹妥、未能同時出發、須過幾天、他才單獨動程、</p>
<p>麥紹漢足傷、尙須休養　、將俟大軍到達星洲、他才趕往歸隊、李惠堂亦尙未偕行、</p>
<p>因此、昨天開拔的祇有領隊莫慶、幹事周潤年、隊員包家平、張榮才、李天生、侯容生、李國威、郭英祺、劉慶才、劉松生、楊根保、譚振輝、鄧廣森、楊水益，馮景祥、黎兆榮、陳德輝、卓石金、羅斗文、一行共十九人、</p>
<p>莫軍師說、「這次行程、先到海防、轉往河內、順化、西貢、馬來亞羣島、吉隆坡、柔佛、星架坡、馬六甲、雪蘭莪、霹靂、檳榔嶼、緬甸、仰光、蘇門答臘、棉蘭、荷屬八打戚、三寳壟、泗水等地、然後取道岷尼拉返港、需時約四個月、九月中旬趕返參加下季足球聯賽」</p>
<p>別矣征人、「莫愁前路無知己、球國誰人不識君」、且待秋凉九月、歸來冉會、但祝前途無恙、「足上」生威、</p>
<p>我們歸途中、在渺茫的烟水中、望着郵巨型的廣東號、與我們距離漸遠而至於消失、</p>
<p>足球部郝主任田立發、邀我們踏上瑣零閣、一杯在手、洗滌離腸、</p>
<p>（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>田邊耕一郎的郭沬若</h3>
<p>— 麥穗</p>
<p>日本作家或詊論家描述外國作家的文章，都含有毒剌的日本主義的思想。這是他們所謂「武士道精神」的狂妄與無恥。日本文壇散佈着這種毒菌，是日本法西主義的文學者的倒行逆施。日本評論五月號田邊耕上郎的「郭沬若」，就是含有這種毒菌的文章，田邊頌楊「東洋文化」與「東洋和平」，是與日本法西軍閥的口吻同出一轍的。</p>
<p>文章共分成四節來叙述郭沬若的生涯，一開首就這樣說：</p>
<p>『郭沬若是魯迅死後中國文壇上的巨頭，在中國的新靑年之間，是崇敬他爲第二個魯迅的。』</p>
<p>這是對郭沬若表示敬重，但是，跟若他又是這樣說：</p>
<p>『我原和郭沬若一面不識，作爲東洋人的人道主義者的郭沬若，在這無可避免底事變的悲劇下，我爲了他是文學和思想家的緣故，自己曾暗地裏對他底態廣作過深奧而趣味的眺視。爲什麼呢？爲了民埃的不同，在愛國心情上，在超民族超利己主義的人類正義底理想上，假如我們和郭沬若同樣，在這無可避免的中日大悲劇的發生，「東洋和平」是樹立在「民族共存」上面，我們互相要有一致挺身而出的志雖。</p>
<p>這裏所謂志願，是和日本法西軍閥的倒行逆施同出一轍的其後田邊還唁示着說：他並不條汪精衛那樣，在事變下自覺地承認中日協同體是有可能，而投身到抗日陣營裏去？我確是對郭沬若不解的」。我國的抗戰是爲了民族的獨立，而且日本的法西軍閥把日本的人民驅到戰場上來嘗炮灰，全是爲了造成他們自身階級的地位，這槍狂暴的行爲，不但是中國人民的大敵，同時也是日本人民之敵，爲了人類的正義與和平，我們是該一致打倒共同的敵人——日本軍閥。除了漢奸和走狗之類，甘心倒行逆施之外，全世界愛好和平的人類，我想也反對日本軍閥這種狂妄行爲的，田邊旣沒有這種認識，反而替軍閥吹牛，是多麼無恥！</p>
<p>然而，田邊還引用下面一首詩：</p>
<p>「又當投筆請纓時，別婦拋離斷藕絲，去國十年餘淚血，登舟三宿見旌旗，欣將殘骨埋諸夏；哭吐精誠賦此詩，四萬萬人擠蹈厲，同心同德一戎衣」。</p>
<p>他對這首詩三跪九叩的讚譽着：「是一首壯麗的憂國之士的詩，日本人的武士道精神，對這種壯靈的心懷，是敲着船舷讚譽的。……他對祖國的正直，日本人無論誰都首肯的。」</p>
<p>這樣看來，日本人的武士道精神是破產之至了。日本軍閥對我國抗戰是多麼震慄呢！</p>
<p>文章的第二節，他說：</p>
<p>「郭朱若和郁達夫，雖然同是中國文壇的巨頭；然而郁達夫却純然是個作家，郭沫若不但是作家，而且是思想家，更其是學者。他亡命日本的時候，他著的中國古代史和金石甲骨文字的研究，是將成爲不朽的大功蹟。」</p>
<p>他又說：「作爲思想家的郭沬若，究竟站什麼立場，他雖然和蘇聯顧問鮑羅廷同時參加國民革命，但他風言論與行動，與共說是共產主義，不如說是民主的人道主義，而且是極其東洋的人道主義，他正如魯迅一樣，是東洋人的人道主義者。他是政治家，僅是詩人質的，他是詩人，也是熱血型的最紫朴三民主義的學者。」</p>
<p>這種分析也不免陷入日本法西主義者的偏狹性，並沒有虔誠的認識郭沬若爲民族解放奮鬥的最光榮的立場，所謂民主的人道主義和極其東洋的人道主義，也懂不過是　軍備頌揚「東洋文化」與『東洋和平』底幌子而已。</p>
<p>文章的第三節，他對郭氏的作品作最詳盡的叙述，而且想通過郭氏的作品描他底生涯與形象。他說：</p>
<p>『作爲文學家的郭沬若，他在作品有描寫幼年期的生活一我的童年」，描寫着靑春期的『黑貓』，描寫日本留學時代的日本娘戀愛的「落葉」，描寫結婚後在福岡生活的「漂流三部曲」！和創造社時代的『創造十年』與『北伐』。都是他的作品的代表。』</p>
<p>關於『黑貓』他這樣評述！「小說「黑貓』是有着珠淚滂沱的場面正如普式庚的名作『布羅斯基』那機有着浪漫主義底美感。」</p>
<p>他評述『落葉』是這樣說：「小說『落葉』是郭沬若夫婦國際愛的靑春時代的描寫，與歌德的一少年維特之煩惱一並駕齊軀的，作爲靑春的聖典，描出中國現代靑年男女的心。」</p>
<p>田邊對郭沬若的作品的贊譽，但他僅是以一個自由主與文學者的眼光來贊譽，他並沒有理解郭氏的作品反映着的郭氏的生涯，而且也並不理解郭氏的作品是中國解放爭鬥過程的描述。在這一節秦。田邊只拘泥着日本主義者的思想，沒有伸展到為人類正義及反軍閥的眼光。可以說這是作為日本作家，一貫的下流性格。</p>
<p>在第四節中，田邊更表露着他底獰猙的面目了，他固執地擁護東洋文化，充滿了日本軍閥的排歐排外思想。他對郭沬若最近的行動，下這樣的斷語：</p>
<p>「郭沬若只是爲四萬萬民衆和祖國的命運而從日本逃　，現在爲要救祖國與四萬萬民衆，樹立東洋的理想，主張『東洋和平』我想是郭沬花等的一大使命吧！」</p>
<p>這是多麼無恥的笑話，所謂「爲救中國和四萬萬民衆」，就是我們在日本法西軍閥侵略下爭取自由，我們要堅持持久戰爭與最後的勝利。現在，日本遭了我國嚴重的抗戰，已一天天的趨於崩潰，眼前就是他們滅亡之路。田邊這頗的日本作家，就替軍閥侶導日麼東洋和平」「東亞協同體」，這種自欺欺人的狂言，是簡直失了作家的良心。，正如郭沬若先生在「中國人的確是天才」裏設：</p>
<p>「中國人的確是天才，而一般對中國不懷好意的日本人，是嫉妒我們，盡力阻碍我們的發展的。但我們絲毫不要氣餒，同時也不要自滿，……大家下一個决心，刻苦地奮動吧。」</p>
<p>這段話確是給日本法西文學者們痛快的打擊，嫉妒我們的日本法西惡　，也徒見心勞日推而已。從田邊的「郭沬若」看來，不但是表現着日本法西文壇的沒落，而且表明日本法西軍閥的滅亡！</p>
<h3>地下火</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>有些人怕火，飛禽走獸尤其怕火，他們一看見火，如果不能弄息牠，就只有飛快的逃開，免得被燒死，如果能够弄息他，那他們當然是願意盡其力之所及，使之消滅的</p>
<p>火固然是從天上來的，然而爲了怕火者的摧殘，也就會向地下去，於是當今的火，我們就看見他的潛身地下，使世界上暫時停止了烈烈轟轟，燒毀一切穢物的場面，摧殘者的得意，自然是可想而知的。</p>
<p>原來火是活潑的，巧捷的，同時也是激烈的，上帝的聖靈，也就以她爲代表，他不願在摧殘者的穢朮之下，輕易犧牲，他可以暫降他的烈焰，他可以稍歛他怒步，如果逼得緊，他可以深藏於地下。</p>
<p>在地下，他找到了豐富的煤，任何足以加增力量的燃料，他非但不就此息滅，更因此而熾盛，他不斷地伺隙而出面燒痛摧殘者的手，腳，以及任何一部份的肢體，銷鎔地上任何惡物的蹤跡一旦時機成熟，他會轟然爆發，震動天地，重新囘到地上來。</p>
<h3>名</h3>
<p>— 聞歌</p>
<p>人生　平凡　人壽啊幾何？有人感慨起來，不甘默默地度過一世，眉頭一皺，計上心來，覺得大可以做一番事業，留二個一名」在人家的腦海中。因此人們便多了一種工作：求利之外，更要求名。有了名旣可以聞達於當時，又能流傳於後世，使人家一聽到，便會肅然起敬，惶恐不巳。一舉而魚與熊掌兼得，大是美事。</p>
<p>名是死的，要有名便須求。求的方法，不外乎鑽，拍，捧等幾種。我正在學鑽，學拍，學捧中人具體的程序當然說不出，所幸這幾種成功的好處，我倒有些耳聞目見，不妨說出來大家聽聽，省掉些藏之名山的跋涉。</p>
<p>假定你的名可以聞達於當時，那你各面都會得心應手，常扯順風旗。醫如你是一個名震南北的文人，那眞了不得，不但讀者們欽佩莫名，連編者們也五體投地，因此，你的文章人就會像希世奇珍一般地搶奪，不用說是紙貴洛陽了。這麼著，你便可偶然搭搭架子，若卽若離地，對付著一羣拉稿者之以增加人家對你的大名信仰，直至於最高案。如此以後，縱令你有不好的作品，也不愁沒有用路了。</p>
<p>文人有名的好處，不僅此也，當然還有旁的，你是你文人做膩了，想改一改行那容易得很，要仠麼便是什麼，祇要你與之所至的話。</p>
<p>文人如此，推而廣之，大腹賈何嘗不可以藉善名而廣收其利？「華威先生一之流底正人君子又何嘗不可以藉著名而躍登政治舞台？名有這樣多的用處，於是乎世上便多了不少爲名忙亂的人，於是乎有人便要搖其頭而擺其尾曰：「名之然用大矣哉！」</p>
<p>但人是不免要死的，假如你這個有名的文人死了，我想一定和常人兩樣，人家不但都要追悼或紀念你，甚至政府也會爲了你下命令褒揚，立傳，宣付國史館和發些治喪費，這些，都是因爲你有名的緣故才如此，至於以後呢，好處自然還有許多，別的且不講，你的大名總可以隨史冊的記載和人們的傳說，傳之於憶萬年的。所以那時你雖死，你還該替你自己慶幸，因爲有千千萬萬沒有名的「阿Q」式的膺人們，竟無人替他們言歸正傳，而你却與衆獨異，這眞相隔雲泥哪！</p>
<p>若再推而廣之，大腹　，「華威先生」式人物又何嘗不可以再藉名的力，而一爭身後的哀榮呢！</p>
<p>名的好處有這樣的多，大哉　旣可受惠於身前，又可澤及於身後，好名的大雅君子，盍興乎來！</p>
<p>不過千萬別中了「人怕出名猪怕壯」的毒，因爲這些都是有名的人想限制你們來的威嚇。</p>
<h3>黑眼鏡與冰結漣</h3>
<p>— 恝梨</p>
<p>一看到這個題目，便立刻會使人感到：夏天到了。</p>
<p>炙熱的太陽晒着人們刺激了人們底眼睛，使人們底汗，雨水般地往下流，于是人們喊道：「熱啊熱啊！」</p>
<p>爲了保護眼請不受刺激，于是戴起了黑眼鏡：爲了要來汗少出些，於是吃些冰結漣之類的冷飲品！</p>
<p>可是這兩件東西，在表面上宥來，是屬于夏天的，其實並不然，往常不論在春天狄天冬天，也可以見到這兩件東西，譬如患了眼病，當然要戴黑眼鏡：在舞場戲院內感到「狂熱」時，當然要吃水結漣了。</p>
<p>「六月天氣穿皮袍」說是笑話，則冬天吃結漣不是笑話？但是笑話德管是笑話存在總是存在的，就拿戴黑眼鏡來說，也是同一道理。患睫病而戴黑眼鏡，爲的是「保護」，不受陽光刺激而戴黑眼鏡，也爲的是「保護」爲什麼戴黑眼鏡便認爲是夏天了呢？這都是一些不可解的疑問，不可解的便是笑話，笑話都是不可解的。</p>
<p>然而我們却很明瞭這一點，無論什麼不可解的問題，要它是存在，它總有它的理由，（無論是對的或是錯的。）而我們在夏天戴黑眼鏡吃冰結漣，非但它們不是不可解，它們更有「確定」的理由，上面都已一一說過，根本不用再來饒舌了。</p>
<p>不過因爲它們不是「笑話」的緣故，它們的理由却不能沒有疑問，這倒頗是的……夏大戴黑眼鏡是避免陽光的刺激，吃冰結漣是少出汗，可是這都是受了外來的打擊，而致然的，因爲沒有了抵抗力，才利用這些東西作盾牌，至於往常戴黑眼鏡吃冰結漣都是出於內心所欲的原因。自己缺乏抵抗力，藉此種東西作盾牌，實在是不允許存在的。</p>
<p>因此，在往常戴黑眼鏡吃冰結漣，因出於內心所欲，與人特異，雖是「笑話」，倒頗時髦，風雅，反之，在夏天戴黑眼鏡吃冰結漣，却算不得時髦，稱不得高尙風雅，無非是懦弱的表示，「笑話」而已。</p>
<h3>鄕音</h3>
<p>— 鐵</p>
<p>她又說：你過去寄的信雖都收到，可是每一次的信必定隨來的三起高麗密探，也許夾　着一個日本人，說你是在中國當兵，反抗「滿洲」反抗日本，你的家庭通通是反日份子，給中國通消息。」「我每次信很簡單哪！」「好，那怕你是白紙，他說你全用暗號」。「我們家有日本人哪，我們×總不是有日本老婆嗎，我們不是眞正擁護大日本而做他的順民嗎！」「得了！日本婦人多甚，她們一樣受日本軍人虐待，並不比我們強多少。」日本軍閥，不但殘踏我們中國人民，一樣的壓迫他們自己的百姓。</p>
<p>「所以你每次去信，不但託出人情，還要花出許多錢運動，幸而沒受到意外的爲難。」「還有意外嗎？」「咳！提起這話真叫落淚呀，去年五月吧，陶聚仁接到由漢口奇去一封信，附帶匯去三百元錢，乃是他的故友還他多年的債務，這事人人都曉得，可是日本人認是接濟義勇軍，把他收監了，咱們的縣長——一九一八事變時的維持會長，以後實任了僞縣長，出來作保，他們說縣長與義勇軍通氣，結果縣長被囚禁三年，陶聚仁送命，這是他朋友的天良還錢，那知到是索命，後來把他的財產充公了，他的兒子成了乞丐。」</p>
<p>陶聚仁是我縣的財主，人多麼忠厚，有求必應，附近的人們，誰不稱他是「老好」，事變的那年，一般浪人，遍處燒據，可是陶聚仁沒受著害，窮人們沒有不念他好的，而今竟成這個結果</p>
<p>「去年征收廢銅亂歐，就是家裏有個斧頭，有個火盆都得送到村公所，一聲令下，那個敢違抗哪，現在家中除去一把菜刀。那還見到銅鐵的影兒，就是菜刀一家祗准有一把！」「這樣厲害？」「你還有這種輕慢口吻，我們是驚弓之爲了！」</p>
<p>「徵收穀草，每家二十斤，每一個小學生五斤，命令一下，不出十天，都送到縣城了，奇怪，就是紀森十多年沒納過錢糧，也沒敢落後，每家不但送了規定的撤二最少還要多帶幾斤，怕景過秤的人說少吃耳光子。」</p>
<p>歡募公債，公債也不知發行多少，一次一次的按戶送，名目是勸募，實在叫你買一百，那個敢買九十九呀！誰都知到公債是廢紙，那一個不苦着臉兒默祝蒼天，希望國軍早復失地互歸祖國的懷抱！」</p>

<h3>On the Failure of the × Army's May Offensive and the Future War Situation</h3>
<p>The × Army recently heavily publicized its "May Offensive," but after our army's counterattacks over the past two weeks, it has completely failed. This battle is a battle of great historical significance since the end of the first phase of the War of Resistance and the entry into the transitional period. We should have the necessary understanding of this, conduct in-depth research, and use it as a reference for striving for the final victory.</p>
<p>The × Army's "May Offensive" was launched in early May. According to a Hankou telegram from the × Army's propaganda organization, the Allied News Agency, on May 12: "A Japanese military spokesman announced today that the Japanese army is carrying out a huge scissor movement tactical plan in northern Hubei, claiming that the Chinese army's 12th division has been completely cornered. The Chinese 9th division has been defeated by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's encirclement of northern Henan will converge in the Zao Yang east area, which is about 150 miles northwest of Hankou." A telegram from the same agency on the same day and location also stated, "The Japanese army's encirclement of the Chinese army's 20th division has shrunk into an ellipse with a length of 10 miles east-west and 30 miles north-south. The remaining Chinese army under the command of Generals Li Zongren and Tang Enbo has been cut off from the rear and is now trying to break through in thousands. The Japanese army is annihilating the Chinese 9th division and is now advancing to encircle Zao Yang, which is the left-wing base of the Fifth War Zone of the Chinese army." The main purpose of this "May Offensive" by the × Army, which has been so shamelessly and exaggeratedly publicized, was to use "blitzkrieg tactics" or the so-called "Sedan tactics" to eliminate the best and most elite troops in central China. Implement the "Great Xiangyang Fancheng Advance" to create a situation where the × Army in northern Henan and southern Shanxi could covet Guanzhong and open a "shortcut" to bypass northwestern Hunan Province to support the × Army on the Hunan-Guangdong border in opening up the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway line. At the same time, politically, it could ease the internal anti-war sentiment on the one hand and frustrate the spirit of our country's persistence in the long-term war of resistance, while facilitating the traitors' faction in carrying out the conspiracy to subjugate all of China under the guise of "peace, anti-communism, and saving China."</p>
<p>Beginning on May 1, the × Army launched a general offensive on all fronts. The × Army's northern route captured Tongbai in early May, Xinye on the 11th, and Tanghe on the 12th, attempting to outflank southward. At the same time, the right wing of the × Army's southern route captured Suixian. Zao Yang, the left wing advanced north from Zhongxiang, crossing Yicheng Xiangyang. However, the × Army's northern route was intercepted by our southern Henan army group, and it showed signs of collapse on the 17th. The third division, the right wing of the × Army's southern route, was severely attacked head-on by our left-wing army, suffering heavy casualties. Zao Yang and Suixian were also recovered one after another. The left wing of the × Army's southern route was attacked on its flank by our Hedong troops. After more than a week of fierce fighting, thousands of casualties were suffered. After the 17th, the × Army not only discovered that its plan to "annihilate 20 divisions of the Chinese army" had been shattered, but the × Army itself had been encircled and annihilated by us.</p>
<p>According to the war report released by the Military Affairs Commission, in this battle in central Hubei, more than 20,000 × soldiers were killed, and the wounded were countless. The main forces of the × Fujita, Fujie, and Ogishima divisions, and the Kojima Cavalry Brigade suffered losses of more than half. The × Army's flanking encirclement conspiracy has been completely shattered by us. Since the recapture of Xinye, Tanghe, and Tongbai in southern Henan, and Zao Yang and Suixian in northern Hubei, and Duobaowan, Luohansi, Yuxincun, Wamiaoji, Yanmenkou, and Yuekou and other key locations in Xiangjiang, the remaining × soldiers have mostly fled to the vicinity, and have been continuously pursued by our army in a manner like a tiger pouncing on a rabbit for days. By the 29th, the situation of surrounding and annihilating the enemy had been formed. At dawn that day, the attack began. In one day and night, more than a thousand × soldiers were annihilated. The last stronghold of the × Army in central Hubei was on the verge of crisis, and the × Army in Wuhan gradually came under our control. According to a telegram from Commander Li, who was in command of the battle in northern Hubei, since May 1, × had advanced on Sui, Zao, and Fan in three routes with three divisions and a cavalry brigade, along the Xianghua Highway on the front. After our army, led by Lian Fangjun, fought fiercely from solid fortifications, nearly 5,000 × soldiers were annihilated. Other large armies took advantage of the × breakthrough to launch joint attacks on separate routes, annihilating nearly 10,000 × soldiers in total. × was exhausted and fled in panic. Sui and Zao were successively overcome. In addition, Reuters also fully confirmed the Central News Agency's report of the "miserable defeat of the × Army in central Hubei," pointing out that "the entire Japanese front has collapsed." The × side's allied propaganda organization, Haitong News Agency, also reported on the 25th that "a Japanese military spokesman said that the Japanese army in northern Hubei has retreated to the southern line of the Dabie Mountains and has changed to a defensive posture." On the 30th, the agency reported on the battle in Hubei Province, saying, "The front line is silent" and "The Japanese army is continuing to retreat to Jing Shan"!</p>
<p>The × Army thus slapped itself in the face, admitting all the exaggeration and unfoundedness of its propaganda!</p>
<p>How did the × Army fail? First, as we pointed out in previous editorials and "One Week," the × Army is currently encountering increasingly serious difficulties in military affairs, namely, insufficient troops, dangerous transportation, unfavorable terrain, difficulty in using troops, and a weak rear. This is the most common and serious difficulty encountered by the × Army after the war entered the transitional period and even the stalemate stage, and it is also a difficulty that the Japanese side itself cannot solve. The main reason for the failure of the "May Offensive" lies in this. In the future, the × Army will inevitably continue to encounter failure because of this. Second, due to the existence of these military difficulties, it is difficult for the × Army to adopt appropriate strategies. This "May Offensive" not only made the above-mentioned difficulties more serious because the encirclement line was too long, but also the encirclement was precisely the Dahongshan Tongbai Mountain, where the combat situation was completely favorable to us. As a result, the × Army turned into encircling itself due to the flexible use of our mobile warfare tactics! Third, in terms of tactics, the × people also made a huge mistake. They almost completely did not consider how to solve the difficulties such as obstructed transportation, unfavorable terrain, and a weak rear. Therefore, after they advanced and penetrated deeply with high spirits, when the power of their modern weapons was exhausted, we immediately took the initiative to turn the tables and gain the initiative, allowing us to "pursue the defeated enemy with the posture of a tiger pouncing on a rabbit!"</p>
<p>How did our army win? As the Central News Agency pointed out in its Chongqing telegram on the 30th, "In this operation, our army adopted a new strategy and implemented a comprehensive war. Therefore, our army launched attacks on all fronts, making it extremely difficult for the × Army to deploy its forces in various war zones, and there were no troops available for transfer in their country. Therefore, × could not mobilize more troops in this encirclement and attack on northern Hubei, such as the invasion of Xuzhou Wuhan and the attack on Xiangfan in the first phase of the war. The reason lies in this!" This is a general victory factor. Not only is the victory in northern Hubei today based on this, but also the future continued prevention of the × Army's offensive and the preparation of our army to fight for the final victory are all based on this. The criticisms and curses of the mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare by Wang Jingwei and other stubborn and conservative elements show that they are only speaking for the Japanese aggressors! As for the specifics, this victory is due, first, to the fact that our front-line troops in northern Hubei and southern Henan are good at revolutionary mobile warfare, good at developing the difficulties of the × Army and promoting the advantages of our army; second, to the fact that our army is good at exerting the power of combat behind the enemy lines, cooperating with the front-line regular combat. The main points are: (1) Our army on the Hanyi Road constantly threatens the × rear; (2) Our army on the Pinghan Road constantly attacks Wushengguan, Gongshan and other places to intercept the × Army's supplies; (3) Our army in various parts of southern Henan closely cooperates with the armies in northern Hubei, launching side attacks on the × Army attacking on the northern route; (4) Our army in the Hunan-Jiangxi-Hubei border, under the leadership of General Chen Cheng, counterattacks Nanchang and other places, while our New Fourth Army and others in Anhui Province simultaneously develop counterattacks, such as surrounding Hefei, all of which are sufficient to contain the × Army in central Hubei and help win this great victory.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the × Army's "May Offensive" was to cooperate with the political offensive of the new strategy of the Japanese × invasion of China. They attempted to consolidate the occupied areas east of the Pinghan and Guangdong-Hankou Railways through the "May Offensive," and cooperate with Wang Jingwei and others' political conspiracy of "peace, anti-communism, and saving China" to destroy our war of resistance front, strengthen their rule in the occupied areas, plunder and exploit them, and prepare for further conquest of all of China and even dominate East Asia! Although the "May Offensive" in northern Hubei has failed, a "June Offensive" of the same significance in northern Hunan or even Chaoshan may continue to be planned and realized. Therefore, we should accept and study the experience and lessons of this victory, and make redoubled efforts to increase the difficulties of the × Army today, to develop the progress of our army today. We must step up the expansion of guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines, strengthen the combat strength of the front line, and step up all political work in the war zone and behind the enemy lines. The failure of the × Army's "May Offensive" has proved that the golden age of the × Army has passed! The stalemate stage, in which our strength is evenly matched with the × Army and even the × Army has begun to degenerate, is about to be fully realized! We must tighten the unity of the entire nation and persist in the long-term war of resistance to welcome a greater victory!</p>
<h3>Understanding the Unified Front of Chinese Youth (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Air Dispatch from Xi'an</p>
<p>The unified front of Chinese youth is not only necessary and possible, but also a reality.</p>
<p>The unified front of Chinese youth has its characteristics. Every comrade who strives for the unity and solidarity of the Chinese youth movement must first understand the unique aspects of the unified front of Chinese youth.</p>
<p>The unified front of Chinese youth is national and belongs to all youth. This makes it very different from that in many European and American countries. In those countries, the youth movement, like the general mass movement, often bears the color of a people's front, but the Chinese youth movement resists foreign aggression and is a patriotic movement, so it is more widespread than in those countries. The unified front of Chinese youth is long-term. Because first, China's war of resistance is a war of resistance of a weak country against a strong country, and it cannot but be long-term, so the unified front of youth cannot but be long-term; second, the unified front of Chinese youth is not only for the war of resistance, but also for building a democratic republic based on the Three People's Principles, which is even more likely to be a long-term process.</p>
<p>The unified front of Chinese youth has developed under the condition of scattered and unorganized youth masses. We must not only seek the unity of organized youth, but also unite millions and tens of millions of unorganized youth. Otherwise, the foundation of our unified front will be empty. Therefore, organizing unorganized youth is precisely for the unity of youth. The scope of this work is vast, and even if all existing organizational forces are used to carry it out, there will be no duplication of work.</p>
<p>The development of the unified front of Chinese youth is uneven. The political consciousness and political strength of various classes vary, so that the youth who participate in the unified front now are mainly intellectuals. Although workers and peasants support the unified front, they rarely have the right and the possibility to participate in the organization and actions of the unified front. The political, military, economic, and cultural conditions of various regions also differ, which has a great impact on the development of the unified front of youth. In some places, the youth movement has already achieved complete unity, while in other places it is much worse. In some places, even any youth organization cannot exist, let alone a unified front of youth. This uneven development in both aspects, coupled with the ever-changing domestic and international situation, makes the development process of the unified front of Chinese youth very tortuous and complex. If we cannot recognize this, cannot flexibly grasp the specific situation at that time and place, and only want to reach the sky in one step, or only rely on a uniform formula, we cannot but feel disappointed in our actual work.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unified front of Chinese youth also faces many objective difficulties.</p>
<p>The long-term sharp discord among various classes, parties, and ethnic groups in our nation in the past still has some influence. The vast majority of the people and the vast majority of youth want to unite and unite for a long time, but there are a few stubborn elements who disregard the overall situation and do not understand the great righteousness, or because their class interests and national interests have contradictions, or because they specialize in making rumors, slanders, and sowing discord for a living, and are villains who specialize in eating "friction rice," but they are hindering us everywhere. They want to steal the Three People's Principles and replace them with One People's Principle, replace unity with ××, replace resistance to Japan with ××××, and want to lead the cause of national unity and youth unity astray. Japanese spies and some of their accomplices, traitors ×× pro-Japanese factions, took advantage of the situation and set various conspiracies to undermine our mutual unity, mutual understanding, and mutual understanding among our youth.</p>
<p>The long-term lack of democratic politics in our nation in the past also has a great impact. Ninety-nine percent of the people and youth cannot live an organized life and do not know what organizational habits and organizational concepts are. Traditional politics does not allow the masses to have their own organizations, and it does not like the youth to have their own organizations. Traditional politics either despises youth, hates youth, or suspects and fears youth, and the result is always to restrict youth activities. Therefore, even now, there are still many places where youth activities cannot get public and legal opportunities, and the freedom and safety of youth often lack the minimum guarantee. These all make it difficult for us to change unorganized youth into organized youth and to change the unbalanced situation into balanced work.</p>
<p>The lives of young people are often too painful, and youth education is very backward. Illiteracy accounts for the vast majority. Most young people have to work 12 to 16 hours a day. Except for insufficient sleep, they have no leisure time. Even if there is leisure time, it is not their own. Factory workers often cannot get the factory's permission to establish anti-Japanese support associations, or even to receive some military training stipulated by the government. Some employers take advantage of the national crisis to make a fortune from the labor of young people. Since young people are unable to take care of themselves, it is naturally very difficult to carry out extensive unity.</p>
<p>Conservative families also severely restrict youth. The policy of parents towards their children, especially their wives and daughters, is not to allow them to take a step out of the door and not to allow them to have contact with outsiders. Many young women are in a state of semi-slavery. When they are still ignorant, foot-binding and the buying and selling of marriages have already tightly bound their bodies and spirits.</p>
<p>Youth themselves also have some weaknesses. Because China is a backward country, most of the early cadres of the youth movement are still intellectuals. Although they have their strengths, their strengths are not easily compiled when they approach rural youth and military youth. Also, because Chinese youth suffer too much oppression, their fighting spirit is very high, and they often walk in front of the general mass movement, showing a unique pioneering spirit. This pioneering spirit makes us active, brave, and enthusiastic, which is originally good, but it may also make us sometimes not calm enough and not have far-sighted eyes, thus tending to be extreme.</p>
<p>Fully understanding these characteristics and difficulties of the unified front of Chinese youth is very important for our work. Only in this way can we truly strengthen our beliefs, adhere to our policies, break through obstacles and find a way out. We can now foresee that our speed of advance will temporarily not be universally great within the scope of the whole country, our road of advance will inevitably be rugged and tortuous, and we will inevitably suffer some setbacks and encounter some adverse currents, but at the same time we can also detect that the prospect of our national and long-term youth unified front will inevitably be victorious.</p>
<p>But our task cannot stop at verbal predictions. We must study the laws of development of the unified front of Chinese youth with these characteristics and difficulties. We must grasp all past experiences and lessons so that we can better adapt to today's specific situation and be able to carry out our work more smoothly.</p>
<p>Our experiences and lessons have the following aspects:</p>
<p>First, the basic principle of unified front work is to be truly loyal to the interests of the country and the nation, and to truly achieve "resistance to Japan is above everything, and everything is subordinate to resistance to Japan." We must treat all young people who resist Japan equally, and we must participate in all undertakings that resist Japan, because this is beneficial to resisting Japan. We must persuade all young people who oppose unity, and we must reject all behaviors that undermine unity, because this is beneficial to resisting Japan. We will also have disputes in our work. What should we do then? If making concessions is beneficial to resisting Japan, we should make concessions. If making concessions goes beyond the scope of being beneficial to resisting Japan and weakens the strength of resisting Japan, we should adhere to our position.</p>
<p>Second, for the sake of the interests of resisting Japan, the inside of the unified front must respect each other, help each other, and develop each other. It is impossible to have a unified front if you only see yourself and not others, and if you only care about your own individual development and do not allow everyone to develop together. Resisting Japan requires strengthening the strength of the whole, not digging out flesh to mend sores, or drawing from the left hand to add to the right hand.</p>
<p>In some schools in one place, a small number of students organized a group. Today, they beat up a few teachers, and tomorrow, they drive away a few students. After all the trouble, even if everyone is afraid of it, they never admire it or sympathize with it. How many people did it have when it was launched, and how many people does it still have after a year and a half.</p>
<p>Conversely, if they are humble, helpful, sincere, and loving to each other, then they will all benefit. In a small school in Taiwan, there used to be two teachers who disagreed with each other. One person was in charge of a night school. The first night school had many students, but the second night school did not have a single student. At this time, the teacher in charge of the first night school voluntarily brought the students there to the second night school and cooperated with the teacher in charge of the second night school. Later, the feelings of the two teachers became completely harmonious, and their night school flourished. Although this is a very small matter, it contains a great truth.</p>
<p>Third, for the sake of the interests of resisting Japan, the unified front must strive to be conscious and self-reliant, and must be democratic, and cannot take tough measures. Each person has his own thoughts and beliefs, and each organization also has its own special history and special position. They are unwilling to suddenly disappear unconditionally. It is of course possible to increase strength if several organizations merge with each other in an appropriate way, but if the method is improper and some organizations feel that they are not automatic but passive, and that it is not a merger but an annexation, then it will only destroy the precious vitality of the country and the nation. The more you want to increase strength, the more strength will decrease. The more you want to unify youth, the more youth will not be unified. For example, a man and a woman who do not understand each other can gradually understand each other. If they are forced to marry, they will only be at odds with each other all day long, and if they have a chance, they will still divorce. (Laughter)</p>
<p>Fourth, the establishment of a unified front is a process. Usually, to achieve organizational unity, it often starts with the unity of action. The experiences of the youth movements in Xi'an, Guangzhou, Wenzhou, and other places have proved that a concrete and daily unity of action is more effective than all empty and formal unity.</p>
<p>The students of Jinan University in Shanghai were in a state of division for a very long time. During the War of Resistance in Suiyuan, some students initiated a fundraising campaign for winter clothing for the soldiers on the front line. The fundraising campaign was first started by the president of the school, and then all the teachers and students of the school participated. A unified management committee was organized. This movement later developed into a one-cent-a-day movement for the whole school, and it has been affecting the entire city of Shanghai. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Our Army Rapidly Advances in the Bloody Battle in Central Hubei, Besieging Zhongxiang and Fiercely Attacking the × Army Invading Southward, Sweeping Northern Hubei Smoothly and Clearing Away the Remaining × Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing from Our Newspaper on the 30th] The great battle in central Hubei, aimed at preventing the × Army from crossing the Xiang River, has continued for two days and nights. The × Army has invaded in two routes. One route is spying on Yichang along the Hanyi Highway and has been intercepted by us in the Luohansi area. The other route is scurrying southward and has invaded Yuekou Town. Our troops on the northeast bank of the Xiang River are reinforcing the area. The sweep in northern Hubei is proceeding smoothly. All strongholds have been recovered. The remaining × soldiers have been cleared away. Zhongxiang, an important stronghold with decisive significance for the victory or defeat of the battlefield in central Hubei, is being besieged on three sides and will be recaptured soon.</p>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Chongqing on the 31st] Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission General Feng Yuxiang announced that the defeated and残 (remnants/defeated) Japanese troops in northern Hubei have been forced to retreat 200 li. The Japanese army has suffered 25,000 casualties on that line. According to estimates by the Chinese military authorities, the total number of Japanese casualties since the start of the war is 870,000. General Feng dismissed the number of casualties claimed by the Japanese side as completely exaggerated and inaccurate. General Feng also expressed extreme satisfaction with the training and morale of the Chinese new army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xi'an on the 30th] Military intelligence: the × soldiers between Dezhou and Jinpu on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, with nearly 10,000 troops, have launched a large-scale invasion from En County Yuanping and breached the Yellow River north and south on the 25th and 26th. Our army engaged in more than 20 melee combats with the × soldiers. The × soldiers suffered more than 1,000 casualties and retreated to Daizhuang Kou in Tai'an. We are still pursuing the attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing on the 30th] News from Shanghai: fierce battles have been raging for days between Jiaxing and Jiashan on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The bridge between Xin Zhuang has been destroyed by our army, and the highway has also been cut off in two places. The × troops have been trapped inside and have repeatedly tried to break out to make contact, but they have been repulsed by our army. A few days ago, 200 × soldiers in Jia Shan tried to break out again to go to Jia Xing, but they were fiercely attacked by our army. The × soldiers suffered 140 casualties, and the remaining 50 fled back to Jia Shan and are now holding on to the trenches.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai on the 31st] Chinese guerrillas are very active on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway between Jia Xing and 南 (South). Japanese artillery departed from Hangzhou, attempting to intercept the guerrillas, but the railway near Jia Xing has recently been cut off.</p>
<p>[Fast News from Continental News Agency, Zhaoqing] The war on the upper reaches of the western front has become tense again. The × Army has transferred hundreds of infantry and cavalry and more than ten tanks from Guangzhou Foshan to reinforce the He Kou in the southwest and the Ma Kou area, seemingly intending to invade west, spying on the Sui River coast. On the 26th, 27th, and 28th, they all sent small units to attack Lu Bao, Jin Li, Ma Fang, Lu Cun, etc., but they were severely repulsed by our army and could not advance an inch.</p>
<h3>Great Victory for Us in the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region; Fierce Battles for Over Ten Days Result in Over a Thousand Enemy Deaths; Enemy Reinforcements Arrive Attempting to Re-Offend</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th] Since the beginning of this month, the enemy has successively transferred approximately 15,000 troops from the Pinghan, Zhengtai, and Tongpu lines to penetrate deep into the inland areas of the Jin-Ji-Cha border region for a "mopping-up" operation. Their goal is to open transportation routes from Wutai to Fuping, Wutai to Daying, and X-county to Laiyuan. They first attacked our troops in the area and then proceeded to build highways, launching offensives from areas east of Wutai and south of X-county's Doucun and Dongzhi towns. Starting from the 7th, they engaged in several days of combat with us in villages and towns such as Nanru Village, Hengqiang, Dagu, Jiangfang, and Xiakou. On the 10th and 11th, the enemy, under the cover of aircraft, continued their eastward advance, and Gaohongkou and Gengzhen fell into enemy hands. Another enemy force advanced southward from Shahe and D, east of Fanshan, attempting to join forces with the enemy advancing eastward from Wutai to attack Taihuai Tie (northwest of Longquanguan in northeastern Wutai). On the 13th, over 700 enemies from Daying advanced to the vicinity of Shangxia Yaojian in northeastern Wutai, where they were surrounded by us. After a fierce battle lasting a day and night, most of them were wiped out, and the remaining 200-plus enemy troops fled back to Daying. The enemy advancing southward from Shahe was intercepted by us near Shizi Slope and repeatedly attempted to break through, but without success. After the victory north of Taihuai, the momentum of the enemy advancing eastward from Wutai was shaken. We seized the opportunity to counterattack and recovered Gengzhen and Gaohongkou on the 15th and 16th. The enemy retreated to the Nanru Village area. The enemy on the Pinghan Line frequently reinforced Qu Yang, Dangcheng, and Lingshou from Wangdu, Dingxian, and Zhengding, totaling no less than 4,000 troops. On the 9th, over 500 enemy troops from Dingxian advanced westward but were ambushed by us, leaving behind over a hundred corpses before fleeing eastward. On the 8th, several agricultural enemy troops and over a hundred soldiers in eleven vehicles departed from Shijiazhuang for Lingshou, but were ambushed by us en route in Shangqu Yang. Seven enemy vehicles were destroyed, and over thirty enemy troops were killed. After being struck by us, the enemy invading westward from Yixian regrouped over a thousand infantry and artillery troops to invade Dalonghua to the west. On the evening of the 20th, we bravely met their attack, and the battle lasted until the 21st, resulting in a victory for us. Over 400 enemy troops were killed, and one enemy captain, eight soldiers, and 120 puppet troops were captured alive. The remaining enemy troops fled towards Lianggezhuang, and Dalonghua was recovered by us. At the same time, a portion of the enemy, over 300 troops, advanced eastward from Laiyuan, attempting to join forces with the enemy from Yixian. They were soundly defeated by us near Futu Valley and retreated. In summary, since the beginning of the month, we have engaged in over thirty continuous bloody battles with the enemy in the Jin-Ji-Cha border region, and finally the enemy's eastward advance from Wutai, eastward attacks from Doucun, southward attacks from Daying Shahe, and westward attacks from the two counties of Ding and Yi were all defeated individually. The battles of Taihuai North and Dalonghua were particularly fruitful, with us killing over a thousand enemy troops, seizing three Type 93 mountain guns, one mortar, over forty light and heavy machine guns, over three hundred rifles, one hundred warhorses, three vehicles, and many important documents. Currently, the enemy on the northern section of the Tongpu line is still continuing to reinforce Wutai, attempting to launch another large-scale offensive.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hequ, 30th] On the 26th, over a thousand enemy troops again advanced towards Dagounei Hejiadian in the Anbei area, using smoke screens. Our troops bravely met their attack and, after a hard-fought battle until the afternoon, defeated the enemy, killing over forty of them. We also suffered some casualties.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Three-Power Talks: Significant Meaning; Unified Action Against Japan in the Future; The Outcome of the Talks Will Influence British Diplomatic Notes; A Major Turning Point in the Far Eastern Situation Is Expected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shanghai 31st Special Dispatch] According to usually reliable sources, the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France held a meeting last night at the British Consulate General here, lasting three hours. However, as of this morning, this information has not been officially confirmed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shanghai 31st Special Dispatch] The French Ambassador to China, S-M, met with the British Ambassador yesterday morning for approximately one hour. However, both British and French officials have not confirmed this information.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London 30th] Britain is now preparing to expand its Far Eastern policy, shifting from economic assistance to China to resisting Japan, in order to counter Japan's threat to British interests in China. Britain is currently actively considering issuing a diplomatic note to Japan, the wording of which will depend on Japan's actions in the coming days. If Japan's actions interfering with British interests in China show some restraint, the wording of the British diplomatic note will be moderate. If Japan continues to pressure British shipping and demand the seizure of sovereignty over the public concessions, Britain will adopt economic defense measures to impose sanctions on Japan. British government legal experts are currently studying various methods and may include requests in the diplomatic note as needed. Due to the delay in discussions among various departments, this diplomatic note will not be sent to Tokyo for several days. The diplomatic representatives and naval commanders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are currently discussing the following issues in Shanghai: (1) the Japanese Navy's blockade of the Chinese coast; (2) the Japanese military's demand to rule the public concessions; (3) the crisis in Gulangyu. The outcome of these talks in Shanghai is bound to influence Britain's diplomatic note to Japan.</p>

<p>From X-X place, riding in a special military vehicle, on a night controlled by the dark, as if deceiving the heavens to cross the sea, arrived at X-X county near the Longhai Railway. General Song Xilian, the famous anti-Japanese general during the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, leads his brave soldiers, quietly and silently, in recuperating here, waiting for the counter-offensive period to arrive. He will leap out like a divine dragon and drive the Japanese out of the country.</p>
<p>The reporter met General Song, who was promoted from the 36th Division Commander to the X-X Army Commander, on such a dark night. He first narrated his movements after the Shanghai Battle, then talked about the international situation, and finally concluded the conversation with optimistic and excited words about the war situation.</p>
<p>"After the August 13th Shanghai Battle," he was lost in reminiscences of the past: "I bid farewell to those comrades who exchanged their blood and flesh for the lives of the Japanese, and who died on the battlefield. Leading more than two thousand battle-hardened brothers, I went to Nanjing for replenishment and training. When we completed our replenishment and training, and were preparing to return to the front lines, the Japanese iron hooves were already advancing madly towards Nanjing! At this time, we joined the battle to defend Nanjing, and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese for eight days under continuous artillery fire!"</p>
<p>"After the abandonment of Nanjing, my troops went to Jiangxi, first to reorganize, and then went north to Xuzhou, where under the command of General Li Zongren, we participated in the annihilation battle of Heierzhuang. Then we rushed to Macheng in Hubei, and fought a bloody battle with the violent Japanese for fifty days in the great battle to defend Wuhan! After that, we went to Nanyang in Henan for reorganization, and then came to this place. Recalling the brothers during the August 13th Battle, they have now all been promoted to squad leaders."</p>
<p>"During the battle of Nanjing, a squad leader in my unit was captured by the Japanese. Together with other officers and soldiers from friendly forces, they were taken by the Japanese to an open space and machine-gunned. This squad leader was very clever. As soon as the Japanese machine gun fired, he pretended to be shot and killed. After lying still for more than two hours, he secretly raised his head to escape. Who knew that the Japanese guards had not left? He was stabbed twice by the Japanese, but he remained silent and pretended to be dead. At night, he pressed his wound tightly and escaped from the pile of bloody corpses back to the unit, and has been promoted to company commander. He often tells the new recruits the story of his escape and the brutality of the Japanese. Therefore, the brothers have a common belief: 'Even if we are surrounded, we can only fight to the death. We cannot be captured!'"</p>
<p>"The brothers are always incomparably brave in every battle. Especially in the Battle of Fujin Mountain, we defeated the Japanese 13th Division in a rout! More than four thousand Japanese soldiers were annihilated and wounded by us, and we also wounded one of their brigade commanders. Now every veteran has one or two trophies from the Japanese."</p>
<p>"From the previous battles, I can see that the Japanese combat ability and spirit are declining day by day, and weakening more and more. Until recently, the attacking edge of the Japanese is often cut off by us everywhere. Our army has improved in both technology and weaponry. This intuition alone is enough to make every Chinese optimistic and excited about the future of the war."</p>
<p>"Speaking of international issues, the most prominent thing is that the totalitarian countries such as Germany and Italy are pressing the United Kingdom and France more and more fiercely. The United Kingdom and France have reached a point where there is no retreat, so a world war will break out sooner or later. After the outbreak of the European War, the situation in China may be a bit more difficult, but this is an inevitable process in the Sino-Japanese War. However, we know that the current war is an economic war. The United Kingdom and the United States are helping us. On the one hand, it is because we are fighting well and others look up to us, thinking that we are a nation worthy of help. On the other hand, it is also because China has fertile land and abundant mineral resources. If our country was a desert, then the United Kingdom and the United States would not have any need to help us. Therefore, as long as we work hard to develop resources and stabilize the currency, we have a sufficient country with manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and we are fighting against a country with little land, few people, and financial difficulties. As long as we are united, we are confident of defeating the Japanese. As for the Japanese fighting on our land, letting their iron hooves trample on it, and giving us all kinds of pain and difficulties, that doesn't matter. During the European War, the German army also fought on French soil. When it was over, because of the economic collapse of Germany, he had to withdraw from French soil completely, and France still won the final victory."</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to Song Xilian, I went to X-X village, dozens of miles away from here, to visit the mechanized troops training there. Near X-X village, I saw tanks as numerous as ants crawling around, running back and forth. The reporter felt infinite surprise and excitement! Looking back at the villagers coming and going, they all regarded it as nothing, just like the residents of Shanghai have no feeling for the speeding cars. It turned out that they were already accustomed to it. The reporter then went to visit the person in charge of the team and had a long talk with him. However, most of what was discussed was related to military secrets and could not be publicly disclosed. But there is one sentence that can be told to the readers, that is: When the third phase - the counter-offensive period - begins, all the elite soldiers and mechanized troops will jump on all the battlefields of the country and launch a fierce attack on the defeated Japanese, driving them all the way down the Yalu River!</p>

<h3>Admiral Oikawa Hosts a Banquet for Naval Commanders from Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai 31st] Admiral Oikawa, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese X China Fleet, will host a banquet on the flagship "Izumo" tomorrow, supposedly to entertain British Naval Commander Noble, US Naval Commander Yarnell, French Naval Commander Beaucorps, and Italian Naval Commander Gogent. Noble will visit Oikawa on Friday to discuss various issues, primarily to seek a solution to the Gulangyu incident. Foreigners here believe that the chances of the talks succeeding are slim. Especially since semi-official sources say that the Japanese Navy landed in Xiamen this afternoon as reinforcements. The purpose of the Japanese Navy's landing in Xiamen is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Gulangyu: More Japanese Troops Land; The Purpose is to Demonstrate</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Shanghai 31st] A Japanese military spokesperson explained on Wednesday that the reason why the Japanese military sent more troops to land in Xiamen was due to the surge in anti-Japanese movements in Gulangyu and the concessions. However, neutral observers believe that the Japanese reinforcement is likely to demonstrate to the British, American, and French navies landing in Gulangyu.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Tokyo 31st] The telephone lines between Xiamen and Gulangyu are out of service because an English ship carelessly dropped anchor there on Monday and cut off the undersea telephone cable. Japanese engineers have now begun investigating.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Japanese Organizations Threaten the Municipal Council; Declare That if the Land Regulations Are Not Revised, the Japanese Side Will Take the Final Effective Steps</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Shanghai 31st] The Japanese-language newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" claimed today that the Japanese Road Association has issued a declaration urging the Municipal Council to change the election system, give taxpayers greater "rights," and suppress anti-Japanese terrorist activities. The newspaper also said that the Road Association is prepared to convene a Japanese meeting when necessary to discuss ways to deal with the concession authorities. If the Municipal Council does not change the "Land Regulations" and ignores the demands of the Japanese, the Japanese side will take the final steps to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Shanghai 31st] The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department has returned the registration certificate to the "Ta Mei Bao," allowing the newspaper to resume publication on June 2nd. However, the "Ta Mei Bao" authorities have decided to publish a weekly magazine in the future instead of a daily newspaper. According to reports, the "Ta Mei Bao" was stripped of its registration certificate on the 19th for publishing a summary of Chairman Jiang's speech, because the Municipal Council believed that the summary of the speech "harms the peace and order of the Public Concession."</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side Promotes Big Propaganda, Attempting to Attack Outer Mongolia; The Japanese Kwantung Army Issues a Proclamation; The Ambitions Are Revealed</h3>
<p>[Shanghai 31st] According to a dispatch from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the crisis on the Manchurian-Mongolian border became more tense today, because the Japanese Kwantung Army has decided to counterattack Mongolia and carry out a "mopping-up" operation. The commander of the Kwantung Army issued a proclamation at 4:10 pm yesterday, saying, "The current situation on the border is entirely caused by the illegal entry of Mongolian troops into Manchuria". Because the Outer Mongolian army has repeatedly attempted to sabotage the territory of Manchuria, the Kwantung Army has now made a final decision to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Japan-Manchuria Agreement, and, together with the Manchurian army, will adopt a cooperation to defend the territory". The proclamation expressed serious concern about the participation of Soviet aircraft in the war, and said that in the recent air battle, a large number of Soviet aircraft were shot down and fell within the territory of Manchuria. Yesterday, the activity of the army and air force in the border area was extremely frequent, as if a fierce war had broken out on the border. According to reports from the Japanese side, hundreds of Soviet and Mongolian aircraft participated in the battle. The number of Japanese participants was not announced, but the proclamation claimed that 42 Soviet aircraft were shot down, while the Japanese side lost one aircraft, and the pilot of this aircraft landed on the Japanese line with a parachute. The puppet state of Manchuria also followed the Japanese and issued a new protest to Mongolia. Domei News Agency said that the nature of the protest was "like an ultimatum", stating that the Manchurian army has closely cooperated with the Japanese army and adopted "self-defense" measures, and firmly demanded that the Mongolian army stop illegal activities.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Party Affairs and Finance Are Actively Improving</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shaoguan 30th Special Dispatch] In order to develop party affairs, the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters has decided to hold weekly group meetings, divided into five groups, with the directors of each department serving as the group leaders, focusing on launching party affairs in the war zone.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shaoguan 31st Special Dispatch] Recent key policy measures of the Guangdong Finance Department include: (1) The financial personnel training class has completed its term and is assigned to serve in various counties, and tax affairs in various counties and cities are progressing well. (2) Planning for expenditures of 9 million yuan per year, which is proposed to be shared by the treasuries of various counties.</p>
<h3>Inspection Diary of Hanoi</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>(Continued from the May 30th edition)</p>
<p>"(Won Lort Correspondence) Wang Jingwei and X-X-X-X, recklessly create peace talks, betraying the party and the country in the first place, and sowing discord afterward. In the midst of national attacks, they fled to Hanoi, and are ready to be puppets. Now Wang X is instructing his henchmen to move around, buying up speaking organs, and advocating pro-peace rhetoric to confuse compatriots and achieve their selfish desires. Yesterday, major commercial firms in the capital suddenly received a small blue book entitled: "Collection of Recent Speeches by Vice President Wang, with Peace Opinions from Famous Scholars, Published by the Guilin International Review Agency". This booklet is obviously compiled by Wang X's claws. Their claim that it was printed in Guilin is completely deceptive. The current Guangxi can hardly tolerate the activities of Wang X's claws. Their purpose in sending it to overseas Chinese merchants is nothing more than to confuse the public and bewitch overseas Chinese. The contents of the booklet include words such as "The Vice President advocates peace talks, from the Konoe Cabinet to the Hiranuma Cabinet, the overseas Chinese leader Zhang Shuifu responds to Vice President Wang's peace proposals. Before leaving Chongqing, Mr. Zhu visited Jiang to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of peace and war. The peace movement has a general trend. Peace and war, the Vice President of the Kuomintang declared a split. The historical view of peace and war in China" and other articles, all of which are absurd and nauseating. Overseas Chinese are extremely patriotic, and they support the war of resistance and the supreme leader as always, and they will never be bewitched by Wang X's few words. Therefore, after receiving the booklet, people generally tore it up after angrily spitting and scolding. The most strange thing is that the booklet was not sent directly from Hong Kong, but from the capital, because the booklet was affixed with Siamese two-cent stamps. It is obvious that it was transported in bulk and then distributed by Wang X's party members or X-traitors here. It is extremely hateful. Overseas Chinese should pay attention to Wang X's toxic remarks and not be fooled."</p>
<p>The donations of overseas Chinese for national salvation have a decisive impact on the future of the motherland's war of resistance and national construction. Now Wang X and his henchmen are intensifying their efforts to bewitch overseas Chinese. We, who are in the speaking circles, cannot but solemnly point out and request serious attention to this issue, and set up concrete countermeasures.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reporter still has something he is compelled to say. When the reporter stayed in Hong Kong in early February, he heard rumors that the Japanese had ambitions for Annam. On February 28th, he heard a broadcast from the Japanese Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station, which said that the Annamese natives were very dissatisfied with the oppression of France and that a national independence movement was likely to occur at any time. Therefore, the reporter paid close attention to this point during his observation in Vietnam this time. It is said that X has bought over the Vietnamese, provoking the ill feelings between the Vietnamese and the French, and between the Vietnamese and the Chinese. A few weeks ago, there was a rumor that the Vietnamese were planning to massacre the Chinese, but the police discovered it and took the necessary measures to prevent it. However, two Chinese were killed in the suburbs. But the reporter did not find accurate evidence and dared not make a judgment. In addition to this, X recklessly created rumors of an attack on Vietnam, shaking people's hearts, causing the general public to store cash, which affected the French currency, which had to be diluted by one or two cents per yuan, sometimes even more than this (this phenomenon was seen in Haiphong). An attack on Vietnam is certainly an absurd rumor that is completely unfounded. However, X's poisonous methods of playing with one trick, provoking dissension, shaking people's hearts, creating terror, and disrupting finance have already been seen in reality. We believe that our friendly country, the enlightened French government, must have necessary countermeasures for all of this. We hope that our Vietnamese people will be extra careful in everything to enhance Chinese-French and Chinese-Vietnamese friendship and strengthen the power of resistance.</p>

<h3>Three-Nation Mutual Assistance Agreement to Be Established Soon; Britain and the Soviet Union Continue Consultations to Make Final Efforts; French-Turkish Negotiations Also Near Completion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] Regarding the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, as well as the agreement between France and Turkey, responsible figures here recently declared that the countries concerned have reached a consensus in principle, with only minor issues remaining to be resolved. It is expected to be established this Friday. As for the British, French, and Soviet agreement, the Soviet Union's response to the British and French drafts still needs to go through diplomatic channels. Therefore, when People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov delivers a speech in the Soviet Parliament tomorrow, he will broadly discuss the Soviet Union's general foreign policy, and he may not provide concrete details about the three-nation agreement. As for the French-Turkish negotiations, they are also nearing completion. The current discussion regarding the Sakarya region is focused on the issue of safeguarding France's interests in that area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 31st] The British proposal for concluding a three-nation alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been disclosed, stipulating that the Soviet Union will provide full assistance to Britain and France under the following circumstances: (1) When any of the three countries (Britain, France) is attacked in Europe, leading to war; (2) When Britain and France go to war due to fulfilling guarantees provided to certain countries; (3) When any European country requests assistance, and Britain and France have already implemented such assistance. Simultaneously, when the Soviet Union goes to war in Europe due to any of the above three points, Britain and France will also provide assistance. It is understood that the second article of the proposal stipulates that any assistance from any of the three countries should be in accordance with the principles of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Furthermore, the third article of the three-nation alliance stipulates that the method of mutual assistance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should be determined through negotiations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] Semi-official sources here have expressed satisfaction with the discussions regarding the establishment of a three-nation alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, stating that it is very beneficial for preventing chaos in Europe. This place has renewed interest in and attention to the Soviet Union's impending signing of the agreement, especially in light of this week's conflicts on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border. Although officials have not formally predicted changes in the situation, the general public believes that the three-nation alliance is sufficient to guarantee a long period of peace and reduce incidents during peacetime. The disruptive state of European mobilization can also be reduced, and the establishment of greater security will be as desired. "The peaceful alliance has 300 million people, and its economic, military, and naval power is extremely strong. Authoritarian countries are well aware of this situation and will be willing to implement diplomatic negotiations to resolve disputes instead of resorting to force."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] Reports from London, Paris, and Moscow all unanimously hope for an early announcement of the anti-aggression agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. News from Paris states that informed sources in Paris believe that the Soviet Union will respond to the British and French proposals in the "near future." The agreement may be officially announced before the weekend. They believe that Molotov's foreign policy speech tonight will only cover general issues and will not address this agreement. Some British diplomatic reporters also have high hopes for this. Bartlett of the "News Chronicle" is the most optimistic. He listed Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky's visit to the Foreign Office yesterday and stated that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds had received new instructions from the British government, preparing to resolve the "only difficulty" before Molotov's speech. That difficulty is the Soviet Union's suspicion regarding the proposal being submitted to the League of Nations. Many people agree with Bartlett's view, requesting Britain to make a clear demonstration that this anti-aggression action will not be stopped by the League of Nations. News from Moscow states that the Soviet Union's response will be sent to the British Embassy before Molotov's speech. Sir Seeds had a long talk with Molotov on Monday night, clarifying several key points. This morning, London newspapers routinely carried other news from Moscow stating that the Soviet Union had also expressed objections to another point, namely the status of the neutrality of the Baltic Sea. They are now unwilling to accept promises of such assistance. The reporters did not explain whether this difficulty could be removed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 30th] Regarding the issue of Britain and the Soviet Union concluding an agreement, the Soviet Union's reply to the British proposal is expected to be sent to the British Embassy before Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presents a report to the Parliament on the 31st. It is understood that British Ambassador Seeds had a meeting with Molotov on the evening of the 29th for one hour and forty-five minutes. The nature of the meeting was the exchange of opinions, and the result was the clarification of several points in the agreement proposal. French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Naggiar returned to this place today and immediately visited the British Ambassador.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th] Regarding the issue of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union concluding a mutual assistance agreement, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov believes that the drafts proposed by Britain and France, with the League of Nations Covenant as the core, are unavoidable. The British government ordered its Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, to negotiate with Molotov regarding the reason why the draft relied on the principles of the League of Nations Covenant, only wanting to explain the reasons for the establishment, but in fact, the mechanical nature of the implementation of the agreement did not diminish because of it. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Oliphant also conveyed this idea when meeting with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon.</p>
<p>Military Cooperation Between Countries: Britain Discusses Separately with Poland and Turkey</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th] The government recently sent military experts to investigate Poland's military equipment needs. Once the government receives the report, it will consider what form of assistance to provide to Poland to complete its military expansion plan. In the view of financial figures, Poland's defense plan is deeply concerned by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and financial assistance should be provided jointly. Among them, France has already lent Poland a huge sum of more than ten million francs over the years. However, the Soviet Union has not yet taken any action, and it is generally believed that the country may not be willing to lend it the item. After the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established, they should jointly discuss ways to assist Poland.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, London, 31st] According to this morning's "Daily Express," Stanley, the Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, flew to Warsaw by plane on Sunday and will stay there for ten days. According to semi-official sources, this trip by Stanley is the beginning of a new friendship between Britain and Poland. According to reports, Stanley accompanied British Prime Minister Chamberlain to Germany for a return visit last September due to the Sudetenland incident and is an important figure in the British Foreign Office.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, London, 31st] The Turkish military inspection team, led by General Aubé, is expected to arrive here today. It is rumored that the mission of the inspection team is to discuss military issues with the British General Staff based on the British-Turkish mutual assistance agreement.</p>
<h3>Troops Stationed in Western Germany Triumphantly Return Home</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 31st] Five thousand German troops left Spain by ship and returned home, entering the mouth of the Ilz River last night and mooring there, waiting for General Göring's triumphal welcome. General Göring set sail this morning aboard the ship "Hamburg" to inspect the fleet at the mouth of the Ilz River.</p>
<h3>Hungarian General Election Results: National Socialist Party Becomes the Largest Opposition Party in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 30th] The results of the Hungarian general election are now mostly clear. The National Socialist Party has become the largest opposition party in the House of Representatives, increasing from no seats to twenty-five seats. The Independent Party, which was originally the largest opposition party, still supports the government party, which occupies an absolute advantage in the parliament, with a ratio of about three to one.</p>
<h3>Southern King and Foreign Minister Scheduled to Arrive in Berlin Today; Important Talks Conducted Behind the Scenes; Germany Will Urge Closer Ties</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Vić will arrive here on Thursday with Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the regent of the country. It is known that although this trip is ostensibly a state visit to Germany, important talks will actually be conducted behind the scenes. Political circles believe that Germany will urge Yugoslavia to strengthen its ties with the Axis powers. However, people from Yugoslavia here insist that strict neutrality is the country's only possible policy. If a good opportunity arises, Yugoslavia is willing to increase its trade relations with other countries, but the country's political independence will be firmly maintained.</p>
<h3>× Passions Boil; Konoe Will Visit Saionji to Seek Assistance</h3>
<p>[Haitong Press, Tokyo, 31st] Privy Council President and Minister without Portfolio Konoe will visit Saionji this Saturday to discuss Japan's current domestic and foreign political issues.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, Berlin, 31st] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Vić recently wrote an article in a publication discussing Prince Paul's visit to Germany and German-Yugoslav relations, stating that after Germany annexed Austria, it became directly adjacent to Yugoslavia, and the relationship between Germany and Yugoslavia has become closer than before. Yugoslavia's exports of agricultural products and other goods are mostly imported by Germany, and Yugoslavia's imports are also mostly from Germany. The close economic cooperation between the two countries can serve as a good foundation for cooperation in other areas. German authorities have provided assurances, expressing their continued policy of maintaining friendly relations with Yugoslavia and respecting Yugoslavia's interests. Yugoslavia has placed complete trust in this assurance, so Yugoslavia has reason to continue promoting friendly relations with Germany.</p>
<h3>Explorer Lander Passes Through the Netherlands to Go to the United States; Reportedly Flying to New Guinea; Great Scientific Gains</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, Netherlands, 30th] Mr. Lander, a member of the Arkborough aviation exploration team, who previously flew to New Guinea with the team for exploration, arrived here today and is transferring to the United States. He stated that the scientific gains of the exploration team are the most important. The team encountered natives who had never seen white people and discovered several new mammals. According to reports, the exploration team consisted of six members who flew from San Diego, California, to New Guinea in June of last year, reaching their destination after flying 10,000 miles.</p>
<h3>British Labor Party Members Request to Have Their Party Membership Restored</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] British Labor Party progressive leaders Cripps, Strauss, Bevan, Young, and Bruce have recently been expelled from the Labor Party and have now decided to request to have their party membership restored. They have already notified the Labor Party Executive Committee, stating their willingness to transcribe the vows observed by all party members. Chakriots was expelled because of his attitude towards the Popular Front and because he had distributed pamphlets to various member groups advocating policies not endorsed by the national Labor Party.</p>
<h3>British King's Speech in Canada: Gratitude for the Warm Welcome from the People; Human Evolution Depends on Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Victoria, 30th] The British King attended the formal banquet of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia and the Provincial Council today. After taking his seat, Provincial Premier Pattullo gave a welcome speech, followed by the King, who rose to express his gratitude, saying, "During this trip west, we have been warmly welcomed by the people wherever we have gone. Since landing in Quebec, the Queen and I have been extremely grateful for the loyalty and love of the Canadian people. It is an honor for anyone to be able to tour such a vast territory, and even more so to be warmly treated by men, women, and children everywhere. I fear that there are few in the world who can have this kind of experience. We will never forget it, and the encouragement we have received will be a lifelong memory for us." The King then spoke about Canada's position between Europe and Asia, saying, "With the advancement of science and the development of transportation, Canada will also become a thoroughfare connecting the two continents. One day, the world will realize that the evolution and prosperity of mankind depends on mutual cooperation, which cannot be achieved through war. The dawn of this day has already appeared, and I hope that Canada will continue to make greater efforts to promote friendly relations between East and West. As Canada's responsibility for international friendship has expanded, the benefits that mankind will enjoy will also be greater."</p>
<h3>Italian Undersecretary for Aviation Presents Air Force Budget; Praises the Effectiveness of Airplane Bombing</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 30th] Italian Undersecretary for Aviation General Val, while presenting the air force budget in the Senate today, declared, "Based on our experience in Spain, we have been able to prove that the effectiveness of airplane bombing is far beyond expectations." Val also said that when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last inspected the first squadron of the Italian Air Force in Piedmont, he had already told him that more than 80 percent of the Italian aircraft in Spain had returned to Italy. "From the battles in Barcelona and Valencia, we have gained the impression that a prosperous area can be turned into a desolate and uninhabited wasteland."</p>
<h3>Legal Tender of France Triumphs Over Japanese Yen: Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance Expresses Views</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wanqing, 31st] Recently, Japanese gold notes and puppet currency in North China have both experienced sharp declines. At the same time, the puppet Huaxing Bank in Shanghai opened and issued counterfeit banknotes. At today's regular press conference, foreign journalists asked the spokesperson of our Ministry of Finance to express his views on this situation. The following answers were given separately: "The facts are obvious, so why bother adding criticism? Since you have inquired, I will reiterate the facts for your benefit. Japan attaches great importance to its gold yen, the same way it boasts its military power. Now, nearly two years into the war, although the legal exchange rate of the Japanese yen in Tokyo is still listed as one shilling and two pence, in fact, it has plummeted to seven and thirty-two elevenths of a penny in Shanghai. Roughly calculated in terms of Chinese legal tender, one hundred Japanese yen can only be exchanged for about 89 yuan of our legal tender. This is fact number one. In North China, the puppet reserve bank initially issued banknotes, hoping to steal the position of our legal tender with a currency without any reserves and backed by empty promises from Japan. Although the name of this counterfeit currency is the same as the Japanese yen in value, in fact, unless using roundabout methods, first exchanging the counterfeit currency for legal tender, and then using legal tender to purchase foreign exchange, it cannot be exchanged for any foreign currency. Moreover, since its issuance, the market price has gradually fallen. Until now, no one is willing to exchange 100 yuan of legal tender for less than 133 yuan of counterfeit currency, even the Japanese. This is fact number two. The puppet Huaxing Commercial Bank has opened in Shanghai and issued counterfeit banknotes. The Japanese exhausted their tricks to disguise it, claiming that the value of the new banknotes issued is only linked to our legal tender and can be exchanged for any legal tender. However, as soon as it appeared on the market, its true colors were exposed. Our government has not yet implemented countermeasures, and it has already shown signs of failure. The market price plummeted to the point where 160 yuan were exchanged for 100 yuan of our legal tender. As for the foreign banking community in Shanghai, no matter how the Japanese promote it, they are not lured by it and instead deny that they have accepted this counterfeit currency. This is fact number three. The above-mentioned facts are enough to make Japanese financial strategists feel discouraged. Therefore, they are racking their brains to find ways to save the situation but ultimately find nothing. One can imagine how serious this matter is for Japan. However, countries around the world are not surprised at all. Even if Japanese gold notes and various counterfeit banknotes continue to fall in value, it is inevitable and reasonable. However, this contains an important meaning. What is the meaning? It is that nearly two years into the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese legal tender has ultimately triumphed over the Japanese yen, as evidenced by this. According to Japanese propaganda, the reasons for the recent sharp decline in Japanese gold notes and various unfounded claims are as follows: (1) inflation in Japan, (2) sharp increase in prices in Japan, (3) the Sino-Japanese War has not ended, coupled with the tense situation in Europe, (4) Japan is unable to implement the original plan regarding the Huaxing Bank. In a nutshell, the decline of the Japanese gold yen is caused by Japan's own destruction of its currency system. It is obvious that Japan's finances are in difficulty, and in order to cope with the war of aggression against China, the government has long since driven the domestic Japanese print shops to frantically print public bonds. However, because society is unable to absorb this unlimited amount of bonds, gold notes are printed excessively to maintain military expenses. When necessary, the Japanese, in the war zone in our country, intend to use the manpower, financial resources, and material resources of our people. The emergence of the puppet Huaxing Bank in Shanghai, such as Japan's new financial plan, uses this bank as a pioneer, aiming to manipulate the economic organization centered on Shanghai. But at the same time, this move is enough to prove the economic difficulties Japan is in, and the increase in supplies is approaching the end. Countless amounts of inconvertible Japanese gold notes and military notes have been issued. Japan's foreign exchange reserves are almost exhausted. This kind of gold note is inherently unprepared. Moreover, once the war ends, Japan may deduct or even confiscate them. As for the worthlessness of counterfeit banknotes in North China, it is known to the world. The predicament it is currently in has completely placed Japan's North China counterfeit currency plan in a state of failure."</p>
<h3>Southwest Africa and South Africa Police Merge</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Pretoria, 30th] Authorities here announced today that the Southwest African police and the South African police will merge from June 1.</p>
<h3>Rhine River Floods: German Defense Line Damaged; Repairs Will Take Ten Months; Rumors of Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 31st] There have been recent rumors of labor strikes on the German Siegfried Line. The political editor of the "Radical" newspaper here declared today, "I have learned from reliable sources that the recent flooding of the Rhine River has rendered 53 kilometers of the Siegfried Line unusable. According to military experts, it will take ten months to repair this damage, which is extremely important because, in the development of diplomatic events, the leaders of the Axis powers must be tenacious about the shortcomings of the German fortifications and cannot ignore them."</p>

<h3>Congratulations on the Establishment of the Hong Kong Branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday. The cultural circles and general residents of Hong Kong have expressed warm congratulations and great joy.</p>
<p>Today's China has become a champion of world peace and has stood on the front line of anti-aggression to defend democracy, peace, and global human culture. The struggle of the Chinese people for the past 22 months has been for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the Chinese nation, and it is also for the practice of the noble ideals of British people who love democracy, freedom, peace, and human culture. This point is commonly recognized by friendly countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, the current British people are urging the government to promote mutual assistance negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to organize an anti-aggression front. This kind of movement is necessary for today's Britain to save and defend itself, and it is also necessary to defend democratic politics, world peace, and human culture, and in reality, it can directly and indirectly help the Chinese people's ongoing war of resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>The improvement of friendship between the people of China and Britain and the closeness of diplomatic relations between the two countries have never been as urgently needed in history as they are today! In fact, there has never been such close cooperation as there is today! Hong Kong today occupies a very important position in promoting Sino-British diplomatic relations and strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Britain. The residents of Hong Kong, especially the cultural circles, have an extremely important task in this regard. The important meaning of the establishment of the Hong Kong branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association lies in this, and the importance of the tasks it should undertake in the future also lies in this.</p>
<p>We hope that social leaders and enthusiastic members of the cultural circles from all walks of life in Hong Kong will actively participate in this branch in the future, and earnestly recognize the current status of Hong Kong, enthusiastically take on the aforementioned common tasks of the people of China and Britain today, trust each other, help each other, to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Britain, to strengthen the cooperation between the two countries, to develop the cultural and educational undertakings of Hong Kong, and to jointly build a democratic, free, and peaceful cultural fortress.</p>
<h3>German-Danish Agreement Rumored to Be Signed in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th] Semi-official sources recently announced that the German-Danish non-aggression agreement will be signed here tomorrow.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Cooperation with Us Is Actively Developing; Epidemic Prevention Experts Distributed Throughout</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 30th] League of Nations special envoy Mackenzie, an Englishman, returned here from Chongqing today and said that the League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution last September to allocate 2 million Swiss francs to promote cooperation between China and the League of Nations. This is now actively developing. Epidemic prevention experts are currently distributed in various parts of North China, West China, and Central China to carry out work. In response to the request of the Chinese government, several doctors and engineers have been concentrated along the Yunnan-Burma Road, which passes through areas prone to epidemics, and are now working hard to improve it so that it can still be open to traffic as usual during the unfavorable season from June to November.</p>
<h3>Britain Actively Expands Navy; Sets Large-Scale Program; Countering the Shipbuilding Movement of the Axis Countries</h3>
<p>[Haitong Press, London, 31st] This morning's Daily Telegraph published the British naval expansion program. According to the newspaper, the British government ordered 75 warships from Grant Shipyards two years ago, worth a total of £52 million. Currently, nine capital ships are under construction, including five 35,000-ton ships and four 40,000-ton ships. Recently, there has been a plan to build more capital ships, as the British government has promised the Australian government to send a fleet to be permanently stationed in the Pacific. At the same time, the construction of five "George V" class capital ships must be accelerated to balance the maritime power of various countries, as Germany, Italy, and Japan are now working hard to build new ships.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, London, 31st] According to this morning's Daily Telegraph, the British Admiralty first ordered two capital ships yesterday, each with a displacement of 40,000 tons. The two new ships will be named "Lion" and "Dreadnought".</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] The War Office recently announced that the British Army will appoint two inspectors general, with General Ishon, the Governor of Gibraltar, as the overseas inspector general, and General Coke as the domestic military inspector general. According to reports, the British Army had the position of inspector general before the European War, but it was abolished soon after. It has now been restored, and it is slightly different from the past.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong University Improvement Association Suggests Central Higher Education Cooperation: Plans to Expand HKU Site and Increase Enrollment; Medical, Engineering, and Faculty in All Departments Will Be Expanded</h3>
<p>As Sino-British relations become increasingly close, cultural communication between the two countries is especially important. Hong Kong, being close to our country, has its highest institution of learning in the University of Hong Kong. If one wants to see the flourishing of cultural endeavors between the two countries, it is easiest to start with improving HKU, so that it can connect with universities in mainland China. This can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The Hong Kong authorities, recognizing this, have established the Hong Kong University Education Improvement Committee, appointing HKU Vice-Chancellor Sir Shouson Chow as Chairman, with Colonial Secretary Mr. Smith, Financial Secretary Mr. Keen, Sir Robert Ho Tung, Secretary-General of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Mr. Li Wu, Bishop Hall, Father Cooney, Mr. Lo Min, Mr. Soley, Mr. Li Tze-fong, Professor Zen, and Professor Wright as members. Mr. Nee has been appointed as secretary, specializing in studying the following matters: (1) What subjects need and can be developed to promote cooperation in higher education between HKU and various universities in China? (2) If this development is implemented, how much personnel and expense will need to be added? (3) Study other suggestions regarding the improvement of HKU. (4) Provide suggestions on the above. The committee held its first meeting on March 14 of this year. Up to April 28, a total of thirteen meetings were held. Based on the results of the meeting discussions, a report was prepared and submitted to the Governor for review last Friday, along with a letter from the committee chairman to Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote.</p>
<p>Improvement Plan Requires Huge Funds</p>
<p>The letter stated, "I am deeply honored to submit the committee's report, which should address how to reform and develop HKU so that it not only benefits Hong Kong but also benefits Chinese people, and facilitates students from mainland China, Malaya, and the East Indies. We are well aware that the various items proposed, if fully implemented, will result in HKU's expenditure greatly exceeding its current income. Our study is not limited to how to develop within the existing financial resources of HKU. We were ordered to put forward the improvement plans that we consider necessary and effective, regardless of the amount of funds required. We feel that HKU, influenced by external environment, now has an opportunity to approach the purpose hoped for by its founders, and that if this opportunity is lost, it will be difficult to recover. Now, we have completed our mission and proposed a plan to establish places so that students from mainland China can receive maximum benefit. The plans we have put forward are for reference only and are not the final decisions. We deeply believe that without a huge amount of help to open the doors of HKU to accommodate these students, a large part of our proposed plans would be meaningless in today's HKU environment."</p>
<p>Sincere Cooperation with Our Authorities</p>
<p>The report is divided into twelve chapters. Chapter 1: Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote's address to the HKU Council on February 10, 1939. Chapter 2: List of committee members, research items, number of meetings. Chapter 3: Nature of research and recommendations. Chapter 4: Relationship between HKU and Chinese universities. Chapter 5: Students' economic difficulties. Chapter 6: Medical school. Chapter 7: Engineering school. Chapter 8: Faculty of Science. Chapter 9: Faculty of Arts. Chapter 10: Various libraries. Chapter 11: Relocation of the university and new buildings in the city. Chapter 12: Summary of recommendations and estimates. The report provides detailed research on various issues. The following is a selection of its recommendations and estimates:</p>
<p>The committee recommends: (1) For the sake of development, the issue of relocating the university to a larger site outside the city should be considered immediately. The new school buildings planned and proposed in this report must be completed before the university is relocated. (2) If the Chinese Ministry of Education organizes a university bureau, it can help the orderly development of Chinese university education. HKU should cooperate with this bureau. (3) A. Efforts should be made to raise funds to establish academic positions for university graduates to study medicine and public health. B. Efforts should be made to raise 28,000 yuan annually to maintain the entire scholarship plan, which is given to graduates and students of Chinese universities. C. Please ask one of the wardens of the university's affiliated dormitory to test student self-catering and use dormitories instead of one room per person to save expenses at HKU. (4) Please ask the government to provide a more suitable sports field.</p>
<p>Add Lectureships to the Medical and Science Faculties</p>
<p>(5) (A) Since Hong Kong has a new-style general hospital supply, Queen Mary Hospital can be modified into a teaching hospital. (B) Dormitories should be set up in Queen Mary Hospital in the shortest possible time for students to live in for treatment and emergency work in the hospital. (C) Within the scope possible, preparations should be made to employ as many government medical officers and private practicing doctors as possible as medical professors, and hospitals should be found for these professors. (D) A new lectureship in physical chemistry should be established to teach diagnostics. (E) In the Faculty of Science, such as in clinical medicine and pre-clinical medicine, there should be equipment for postgraduate students to study. Within each department, there should also be an assistant instructor. (6) The government and HKU should cooperate to establish a public health research institute to improve the health benefits of Hong Kong and improve the teaching of hygiene. However, the institute must be able to issue a public health diploma.</p>
<p>Give Subsidies to Engineering Students</p>
<p>(7) (A) The "degree course" in [Civil] Engineering and Electrical Engineering has been decided to be discontinued, and it has been decided to grant subsidies to students studying this subject. However, once the number of new students is sufficient, or when China needs to train such personnel, HKU should be prepared to develop the engineering departments. (B) A new building must be built as a laboratory for civil engineering and electrical engineering. This school must have some new equipment. (C) The government must be requested to allocate a suitable location in the New Territories as a permanent survey site for the university. (D) The Hong Kong government must appoint HKU graduates as deputy engineer officer students. (8) A. Develop the academic excellence of medicine, lecturing, and degree lectures in medical electrotherapy to accommodate as many electrotherapy degree students as possible and research electrotherapy. An additional lecturer must be added. (B) Develop the honorary professor of chemistry. A microbial analysis department should be established in the chemistry department. This measure requires the establishment of a new lecturer in the biochemistry department. (C) The biology lecturer must extend the teaching to fourth-year students. This requires the addition of a lecturer and a experimental anatomy learning member, and increase the maintenance costs of books. (D) Establish a summer school for aquatic biology. This school should be held annually in the new Fisheries Research Institute and cooperate with the aquarium and other Chinese organizations. (E) Under the Department of Biology of HKU, an office should be set up in the Fisheries Research Institute to manage the supply of aquatic biological specimens.</p>
<p>English Department Adds Lectureships</p>
<p>(9) A. Establish a lectureship in English literature. This requires the addition of a Chinese lecturer in the English literature department. B. In order to study logic, ethnology, history of philosophy, and comparative Chinese and Western thought, a philosophy teaching assistant and a Chinese philosophy lecturer should also be established, in cooperation with the Sino-British Cultural Association. (C) In order to develop historical research, one lecturer and two faculty members should be added. (D) One teaching assistant and one lecturer should be added to develop geography and geology. (E) The current business department should be discontinued, and economics, politics, and law should be developed. This requires the establishment of a Chinese economics lecturer. (F) An advanced teacher training course should be established annually to train Chinese teachers in Hong Kong and South China. (G) Stipulate that students who have not graduated from specialized subjects must read Chinese.</p>
<p>Establish Advanced Teacher Training Department to Improve Teachers</p>
<p>(10) A. Appoint a psychology expert in the Education Department of the government to assist HKU in training teachers. (B) The Higher Normal Department of HKU should pay special attention to teaching Chinese teachers English. (C) The normal department should be jointly established by the Government Education Department and HKU. (D) The Government Education Department should employ an expert to assist HKU in training teachers. (11) HKU should increase library fees.</p>

<h3>After the Murder in Jiaojia Street, Police Detectives Offer Reward to Arrest Murderer: Cash Lost in Safe, Suspected of Murder for Money; Serious Case, Police Search Everywhere for Suspects</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 30th of last month, a tragic murder case occurred at the Man Hing Lung rice store at No. 30 Jiaojia Street, Sheung Wan. The store owner, Wong Tak-kin, and his family of five were brutally murdered, resulting in the tragic deaths of four people, with only a three-day-old baby girl surviving by a thread. It is truly a cruel tragedy. After the incident, the murderer escaped without a trace, and the three store employees and a domestic helper also went missing. The police have paid close attention to this tragic tragedy and have been patrolling all major traffic arteries to strictly apprehend the bandits, but no suspects have been arrested yet. The motive for this tragedy, whether it was murder for money or a deep-seated hatred, is something that the public is eager to know.</p>
<p>Safe Deposit Contains No Less Than a Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>According to police detective news yesterday morning, no items were lost at the scene. However, an investigation by a reporter from the Hong Kong Telegraph revealed that the murderer's motive must have been murder for money. Although there were no obvious changes to the safe on the surface that night, the key to the safe was found on the bed. It was revealed that the safe contained about 1,000 Hong Kong dollars, which has now disappeared. Furthermore, Wong Chau-ming, the younger brother of the deceased, told the Telegraph reporter that it was absolutely reliable that the deceased (Wong Tak-kin) kept cash in the safe. The deceased's store business was exceptionally prosperous, and the store also stored a large amount of rice. From his personal perspective, the cash that the deceased put in the safe on Monday night was at least 1,000 yuan. According to police sources, when the safe was opened, it was found that there was nothing inside, only a few useless receipts. It is learned that the deceased's younger brother, Wong Chau-ming, manages the store affairs at Zhenglong Rice Store on Hollywood Road. Zhenglong has been in business for several years and is his father's property. Not long after Zhenglong opened, Wan Hing Lung was established at No. 30 Jiaojia Street.</p>
<p>Bloodstains on the Embankment Are Clearly Evident</p>
<p>When this tragedy occurred, Wong Chau-ming was still at Zhenglong. Later, an acquaintance knew that Wan Hing Lung had not opened by 11 a.m. and suspected something was wrong, so he informed him. When Chau-ming arrived at the scene, he knocked on the door for a long time, but no one responded. Chau-ming then realized that something had happened and reported it to the police station. When the police detectives pushed the door open, they saw that the order in the store was chaotic, but nothing was lost, and there were no signs of anyone. After careful investigation by the police detectives, bloodstains were discovered. Following the bloodstains, several corpses were found buried in the rice pile. Later, the key was found, and the key was also covered with finger marks and bloodstains, which were clearly evident. From this, it can be inferred that after the murderer committed the crime, his hands were still covered in blood, and then he grabbed the key and opened the safe.</p>
<p>The Murderer Was Not Caught After the Incident</p>
<p>Regarding the occurrence of the tragedy, the Telegraph reporter determined that it was related to murder for money. As for the reason why the murderer killed the deceased's eldest son and eldest daughter, it was to destroy the evidence of his cruelty. The police authorities believe that the occurrence of this tragedy should be urgently investigated and the murderer apprehended. A large number of police detectives have been dispatched since Monday night to search ships leaving for Australia and vehicles leaving Hong Kong for the New Territories. Suspicious pedestrians have also been strictly searched. Starting yesterday, Hong Kong has also begun searching for suspicious pedestrians. Those who are deemed suspicious are taken back to the police station for investigation. However, as of last night, the murderer has not been caught. It was also said yesterday that a suspect was arrested on a certain ship on Monday morning. The reporter believes that this case is of great concern to society and has inquired about news from various police stations, but all have stated that no suspects have been apprehended. At present, the police have offered a reward of 250 yuan to purchase and arrest the murderer and investigate the case.</p>
<h3>Continuous Rainfall and Shortage of Mountain Firewood, Firewood Merchants Manipulate and Raise Firewood Prices; Residents Mostly Switch to Coal to Reduce Burden, Those Who Have Not Set Up Coal Stoves Are Mostly Threatened</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, transportation has been blocked, and the source of firewood has been frequently affected. Several months ago, Hong Kong suddenly experienced a firewood shortage. The authorities have repeatedly sought good methods to solve the problem. General firewood merchants have also purchased and transported large amounts of firewood from Sandakan and Singapore. The panic has gradually disappeared. However, although the price of firewood has not increased, it is still very different from what it used to be. In the past, one yuan could buy 100 catties of Sandakan firewood, but today it can only buy about 60 catties. In the past, one yuan could buy more than 80 catties of miscellaneous firewood, but today it can only buy about 50 catties. Most residents who cannot afford it try to switch to charcoal or coal. Some people also try to search for and purchase mountain firewood. Because Aberdeen and the New Territories are densely forested, many local natives secretly collect and transport firewood to the city for sale. Therefore, although firewood has been in short supply recently, residents are not in a panic because of this supplement. However, due to continuous rainfall in the past month, it has rained for twenty days within a month. Those who usually collect and sell mountain firewood have therefore ceased. Because buyers believe that the firewood has been wet by the rain and is difficult to dry, they mostly do not ask about it. Sellers also do not go to the market. Except for Sham Shui Po, where there is a large stock of firewood, some have taken this opportunity to take advantage of the opportunity to raise prices in order to monopolize the market. Most users who have not set up coal stoves have to reluctantly purchase at a high price. However, unless they have to, they only try to find and purchase mountain firewood for future use. This is ultimately the result of some firewood merchants' pursuit of profit, but it does not have much impact on the normal market situation.</p>

<h3>"Marriage" in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>Marriage in Hong Kong takes many forms, including old-fashioned weddings with sedan chairs, "civilized weddings" with cars, religious weddings, and "signing at the court" registration weddings. I will explain them one by one.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned weddings have three parts: "engagement," "betrothal" (commonly known as "passing the great gifts"), and "welcoming the bride." "Engagement" is the engagement ceremony. The time it is held from the wedding date varies. Some people get engaged one or two years before the wedding, while others get engaged one or two weeks before the wedding.</p>
<p>The "engagement" ceremony involves the groom's family preparing gifts such as wedding cakes, pigs, wine, fruits, betel nuts, and green (tea) and one or two pieces of gold jewelry to send to the bride's family. The bride's family then returns gifts such as clothing, jewelry, "tea feet," and ginger, lotus root, taro, etc., which are considered "auspicious." The amount of gifts depends on the wealth of the families.</p>
<p>The "tea feet" mentioned above is a kind of "term," which includes fried glutinous rice cakes, steamed sponge cakes, "big hair" (a kind of cake), steamed buns, candy cakes, and fried foods.</p>
<p>"Passing the great gifts" is the most solemn ceremony of sending gifts. The number of gifts from both the groom's and bride's families varies depending on local customs. For example, a certain number of dan of shortcakes, a certain number of jars of wine, a certain number of dan of pigs, a certain number of Beijing fruit, a certain number of dried seafood, a certain number of fresh fruit, a certain number of foreign wine... must all be presented in full. If there are any shortages, there will inevitably be quarrels, and the "in-laws may become enemies."</p>
<p>There are many kinds of wedding cakes. Those that belong to shortcakes include: red satin, white satin, yellow satin, roasted chicken, preserved eggs... Other cakes include dragon and phoenix cakes, walnut cakes, sponge cakes... The cheapest costs twenty yuan per dan, and the expensive costs more than forty yuan per dan. The prices of foreign wine and dried seafood "vary at different times."</p>
<p>Wedding cakes and fruits are all loaded in round cake basins, placed on food boxes, and carried by coolies in a mighty procession to the bride's home.</p>
<p>The "birth date" gift book, gold bracelets, rings, and all valuable jewelry, and the "bride price" are still the main things in the betrothal. However, wealthy families usually do not pay much attention to the amount of the bride price because they are afraid that people will laugh at them for "selling their daughters." They just accept whatever the groom's family gives. Some do not even accept it. Economics is the main force in overthrowing the old etiquette. In recent years, in order to save "labor fees," many people have used cargo trucks to transport gifts.</p>
<p>After receiving the gifts, the bride's family also returns gifts such as "tea feet," cloth for gowns, shoes, hats... Books are of course the main item.</p>
<p>"Great gifts" are usually followed by a wedding within three, five, or seven days. On the eve of the wedding, the bride's family will move the "dowry" to the groom's house. The amount of dowry depends on the wealth of the family. Usually, it includes furniture, bedding, clothes... Wealthy people have to "parade the dowry," with a "dowry list" that is several inches thick, including "living room" furniture made of rosewood and sandalwood, sofas, dining tables, mahjong tables, silverware, tinware, dressing tables in the room, small sofas, duck down quilts, velvet blankets, all kinds of odds and ends, jewelry and gold ornaments, all the way down to chamber pots, carrying poles, wood axes, fire tongs, and even salted fish and preserved vegetables. The entire procession is led by musicians and takes half an hour to pass on the road.</p>
<p>On the day of "welcoming the bride," the sedan chair is the main thing. The rental value of sedan chairs varies greatly depending on the grade. The cheapest red satin sedan chair costs five or six yuan, the green sedan chair costs six or seven yuan, but the top-of-the-line electric light green sedan chair costs ten to twenty yuan. If you want the eight sedan chair coolies to wear red uniforms, each one will cost an additional yuan in wages.</p>
<p>In addition to the sedan chair, the ceremonial guard used varies depending on wealth. The simple one only uses a sedan chair, a pair of lanterns, and a group of "marching band," which is called "four blows and six lifts" (that is, four people playing drums and music, and six people carrying the sedan chair).</p>
<p>The wealthy ones use more "great music," and the lanterns must be more than two pairs. The cost of "sugar mountains," "firecrackers," green pavilions, stupid lanterns, parasols, and treasure fans... is not less than one or two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>The even wealthier ones put on a show like a parade, with "horses," "floating colors," employing girls dressed as ancient people riding horses in front, and other girls dressed as palace maids to hold up scenes such as "Heavenly Maiden Sending Son" and "Meeting in the Milky Way," which are carried by people: green pavilions, double greens, single stupid lanterns, soft greens, all kinds of colors, loud blowing and beating, the ceremonial guard extends for miles, and pedestrians stand by the roadside to watch. It takes an hour to see it all.</p>
<p>In addition to the three parts mentioned above, there are other things such as "crowning the bride," the bride's parents greeting the ancestors in the hall on the third day, and sending a roast pig back to her own family on the third day... The cumbersome formalities would make a book if written out.</p>
<p>Hosting a banquet is also a major event. The groom's family strives to hold a "light meal on the first day" and a "plum meal the next day," hosting a grand banquet for relatives and friends for two days. The bride's family must also host a grand "joyful meal."</p>
<p>"Civilized weddings" are a wedding ceremony that saves trouble and money, born out of the decline of feudal society and the collapse of capitalist society.</p>
<p>The simple one only uses a car, tied with a floral sign that says "So-and-so Family Welcomes the Bride," and drives from the groom's home to the bride's home to bring the bride back, which is considered the completion of the wedding ceremony. At most, a few tables of wine are set up in the evening to entertain relatives and friends. A set of plays involving the wedding officiant giving a speech, the host giving a speech, the guests giving speeches, exchanging rings, issuing marriage certificates, tea parties, passports... The wealthier ones will open champagne and dance the tango. Among the guests, some wear long gowns and mandarin jackets, some wear floral dresses and gowns, some wear tailcoats and soft silk dresses. People and things are a combination of Chinese and Western styles. The foreign orchestra also plays the "Wedding March" loudly.</p>
<p>Speaking of wedding halls and tea parties, mid-to-upper-class hotels charge 20 yuan for renting the hall, and the tea and snacks cost 70 cents per guest. High-end hotels do not charge for renting the hall, but the tea and snacks cost one yuan per guest. Champagne, orchestra, and fresh flower decorations are charged separately.</p>
<p>Although many people wear long gowns and mandarin jackets at civilized weddings, some even wear ill-fitting Western suits and hunting outfits, while others wear tailcoats and top hats. It is very expensive to make this kind of formal attire. Foreign tailors charge no less than two or three hundred yuan, while Chinese tailors charge more than one hundred yuan. Fortunately, there are many stores that "rent wedding attire." The daily rental price for a tailcoat, top hat, shirt, and all accessories is only thirteen or fourteen yuan. The daily rental price for the bride's white satin dress, veil, and gloves is only seven or eight yuan.</p>
<p>Religious weddings are held in churches. There are more than 30 Catholic and Protestant churches in Hong Kong and Kowloon that are licensed to issue marriage certificates. After they perform a wedding ceremony for people, they are required to report to the government marriage registry for record.</p>
<p>Religious weddings are similar to civilized weddings, except that the ceremony is presided over by a pastor or priest.</p>
<p>Religious weddings also cost money. Ringing the wedding bells costs 25 yuan.</p>
<p>Registration weddings, where you "sign at the court," are very simple. You only need to register with the registry, and the registrar will announce the names, addresses, and occupations of the bride and groom at the high court marriage registry. You can get married two weeks later. The registration fee is only one yuan. If you are in a hurry, you can apply for a special permit and get married at any time, but the special permit costs 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Holding a wedding at the registry costs ten yuan. The ceremony only involves the registrar, the groom, the bride, and two witnesses signing the marriage certificate.</p>
<p>Although things are so simple, some people often hold a tea party and dance at a hotel hall after registering at the registry, and then hold a grand banquet for guests at a restaurant in the evening.</p>
<p>In addition to the various forms mentioned above, "group weddings" have also been organized by youth associations, and the results have been good. Later, after the "July 7th Incident" occurred, they thought that the national crisis was serious, so they stopped holding them. However, I don't know that the number of marriages in Hong Kong has actually increased from last year to now. (Tomorrow: Funerals in Hong Kong)</p>

<p>Life Insurance Theory</p>
<h3>Life Insurance and the Value of Life</h3>
<p>— Wang Yunyu</p>
<p>What is life insurance?</p>
<p>Life insurance is a method of preparing funds to compensate contributors for economic losses incurred due to death, disability, and old age. From a general social perspective, life insurance is a social strategy for accumulating funds to compensate for losses due to death, where the responsibility for such risks is transferred from individuals or a small number of people to the collective responsibility of the public. From a general individual perspective, life insurance is a contract in which one party, the insured, pays a certain premium, and the other party, the insurance company, compensates the insured or their designated beneficiary with the insured amount upon death or the occurrence of a specified event.</p>
<p>What is the value of life?</p>
<p>The values in the world can be broadly divided into two types: property value and life value. Property value is tangible, such as houses, land, goods, etc., which belong to material objects and can visibly demonstrate their value. Life value, on the other hand, is intangible, such as an individual's skills, knowledge, character, etc., which belong to human affairs, and its value is invisible. Life value is the element that creates property value; without life value, there is no property value. Therefore, life value is actually more important than property value. For example, if a house is burned down, it can certainly cause inconvenience and hardship to the homeowner and their family; however, if the person continues to live and can work, the loss can soon be compensated for, and the house can be rebuilt. Conversely, if the house is not burned down, but the homeowner dies, their productive capacity is lost forever. Moreover, the loss of life is inevitable sooner or later, while the loss of property may never occur, or the time of occurrence may be very distant. Life value, as expressed by our usual earning capacity, is a kind of asset, no different from actual property. However, people are often unaware of this and only recognize the value of property. Therefore, they take property insurance for granted, such as insuring houses, machines, ships, cars, and goods against fire or water damage to protect them. If they encounter dangers such as fire or water and suffer losses, they can obtain compensation from the insurance company. However, they often neglect the supreme value of life and do not think of protecting it and compensating for its loss, which shows a lack of understanding of the function of life insurance.</p>
<p>Life Insurance's Protection of Life Value</p>
<p>Life insurance aims to deal with the economic value of human life. Property faces the danger of water and fire damage, and is insured against water or fire to provide protection. Similarly, the value of human life is also constantly destroyed by the danger of death, and should be insured with life insurance to provide protection, so that the dependents of the insured are not left destitute due to the loss of the insured's productive capacity and suffer economic hardship. Therefore, the greatest purpose of life insurance is to protect the insured's life from the danger of complete or permanent loss of productive capacity due to physical destruction. These dangers can be considered economic death. The following three dangers are the causes of economic death:</p>
<p>(1) Premature death in adulthood</p>
<p>(2) Physical disability</p>
<p>(3) Old age without support</p>
<p>Premature death in adulthood refers to death during one's productive years. The economic importance of this danger is more serious than the danger of property encountering water or fire. And the value of human life, at any time, has the possibility of facing this danger. Physical disability and old age without support, although life still exists, the ability to work has been eliminated, and there is no production, only continued consumption. Therefore, although alive, it is as good as dead.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the above three dangers requires a form of protection to prevent and address them. Life insurance is the only and most appropriate way to protect against these dangers. If we have life insurance, then if we die prematurely during our productive years, the life insurance can serve as the family's future estate, so that dependents are not left in poverty. If we retire in old age and the insured still lives without worry, the life insurance can serve as our own savings for old age. Also, if the insured encounters total disability, there is a considerable income, and they are exempt from continuing to pay premiums thereafter, and the insurance contract remains valid until death, serving as the family's livelihood after death.</p>
<p>Valuation of Life Value and Sum Insured</p>
<p>The fact that the value of life is higher than the value of property and the importance of life insurance in protecting the value of life have been discussed above. Now, let us discuss the valuation of life value and the amount of insurance that should be taken out. Since life value is the capitalization of productive capacity, it is a kind of asset, just like property. Now that the valuation of asset value has become a common phenomenon, it is only natural to treat the larger value of life in the same way. According to the opinions of many scholars, it is believed that the amount of insurance for a family must be based on the income from the principal usually invested, which is sufficient to support the family in the way they lived before the insured's death, excluding the part attributable to the insured himself. For example, if the insured's annual expenditure is six thousand yuan, half of which, that is, three thousand yuan, is used to support the family, then calculated at an annual interest rate of five percent, the principal should be sixty thousand yuan. In other words, one should take out sixty thousand yuan of insurance, so that there can continue to be an income of three thousand yuan per year to serve as the family's support.</p>
<p>This plan is a good general rule for supporting one's family after death, but the size of each family is different, the income is different, and the protection that they rely on from the head of the household's insurance also varies. The number of children who have not reached the age of independence, the existence of dependents who are unable to support themselves, the need for educational funds, and the amount and nature of other investments are all conditions for determining the amount of insurance. In short, the economic happiness of the family is the primary issue that the head of the household should plan for. If we do not use life insurance to provide adequate protection, then for this greatest economic danger facing us, it is no different from taking risks and hoping for luck, which is extremely unwise. As the world-renowned life insurance expert, S. S. Huebner, said: "A householder who does not have substantial property and does not take out life insurance to protect his dependents from the pain of losing his own productive capacity is committing an act that is not far from a crime."</p>
<p>Life Insurance Issues</p>
<h3>Suicide and the Responsibility of Life Insurance Companies</h3>
<p>— Kong Dian</p>
<p>Death insurance within insurance uses the death of the insured as a condition for the insurance company to pay compensation. In other words, the beneficiary designated in the insurance policy can only receive compensation from the life insurance company after the insured's death. However, there are many ways to die. If the cause of death is the beneficiary's murder, and the law still allows them to have the right to receive compensation, then not only will the insured always be worried about the danger of life, but the impact of this will make society regard life insurance as a fearful path, and hesitate to move forward. Therefore, if the beneficiary intentionally causes the death of the insured, not only should they be severely punished for the crime of murder under criminal law, but they should also not be allowed to receive compensation under insurance law.</p>
<p>However, if the cause of the insured's death is not due to homicide, but suicide, what is the responsibility of the life insurance company at this time? There is a need for in-depth research.</p>
<p>Suicide is an act of intentionally harming oneself with the aim of extinguishing one's own life. If the purpose is not to harm life, even if the result of the act is sufficient to create a danger of death, it cannot be called suicide. Therefore, the requirement for suicide is that it must be based on the existence of intention. If there is no intention to commit suicide, and death occurs due to accidental negligence, such as a pharmacist dying from testing poisons, or an aviator dying from a practice accident, it cannot be regarded as suicide. Similarly, death caused by loss of mind and reason cannot be called suicide.</p>
<p>The occurrence of suicide can be accidental, or it can be accumulated for a long time and suddenly occur one day. The motives can be sadness about the times and one's own circumstances, excessive sorrow, or shame and guilt, to avoid mental suffering. Regardless of the cause, as long as it is based on one's own intention, it can be called suicide. As for those who are temporarily mentally impaired, or driven by impulsive chivalry, such as excessive intoxication, misusing machinery, a child falling into a well, or jumping into water to shake off something, resulting in unfortunate sacrifice of life, if it is not intentional, it is not suicide.</p>
<p>Although the causes of death in suicide and homicide are completely different, the result is the same. Therefore, according to Article 66 of our country's Insurance Law, insurance companies can be exempted from the responsibility of paying compensation.</p>
<p>However, it does not seem appropriate to allow life insurance companies to be exempted from paying compensation regardless of whether the cause of suicide is intentional or not. Therefore, our country's Insurance Law only stipulates that insurance companies can claim exemption from liability for intentional suicide. The reason for this is that it is feared that the insured, due to business bankruptcy or a major shock, will intend to commit suicide, but also worry that after death, his wife and children will be cold and hungry, and their lives will be unsupported. Therefore, they specifically enter into a whole life insurance contract with the insurance company in advance, as a plan for the safety of their family. From this, it can be seen that the insured has already had the intention of committing suicide. To protect their own interests, insurance companies can, of course, insert a clause in the insurance policy stating that they are not liable for compensation if suicide occurs within a certain period after the contract is signed. However, although the insured intends to commit suicide, there is no reason for the intention of suicide to remain unchanged for a long time. Therefore, Article 60, paragraph 2 of our country's Insurance Law also stipulates that if the insurance contract has been in effect for more than two years (the British Insurance Law stipulates one year), and the insured dies due to suicide, the insurance company is still responsible for paying compensation.</p>
<p>Although insurance companies can be exempted from paying compensation for the suicide of the insured, the calculation of insurance premiums is based on the principle of level premium, that is, the insured pays the same amount of premium each year from the beginning to the end of the contract period. The amount paid when signing the contract actually exceeds the amount that should be paid based on the insured's actual age. This excess portion of the insurance premium accumulation is originally the amount prepaid by the insured, and is their rightful right. Therefore, although the insurance contract resulting from suicide is invalid, the proviso in Article 66, paragraph 1 of the Insurance Law specifically stipulates that the insurance premium accumulation must still be returned to the insured.</p>

<h3>Constipation and Disease</h3>
<p>— Li Haotian</p>
<p>Constipation is the result of bad habits. It occurs more frequently among people living in cities than other diseases, hence it is called a "disease of civilization." Constipation is the origin of all diseases and can affect the health of all organs in the body. Fortunately, today, the intelligentsia mostly understands that it is a pest that harms the body.</p>
<p>The habit of constipation often forms in early years. Unskilled mothers often unintentionally cause their children to develop this bad habit. Mothers, being busy dealing with their children's natural demands, often make them forcibly suppress the urge to defecate. So, when they enter school, they dare not ask for a short break to go out. When they have grown up, due to social environments, long-distance travel, or being too busy with official business, they need to forcibly suppress the urge to defecate. All of these are the origins of the habit of constipation.</p>
<p>The most ideal routine is for us to eat three times a day and defecate once. Bad habits can cause people to develop physiological abnormalities. Hunger makes one think of food, and fatigue makes one think of sleep; this is habit. Eating and sleeping irregularly can cause stomach problems and insomnia. The best way to treat them is not to seek help from medicine, but to seek early sleep and regular meals. From this, it can be seen that to cure constipation, the same principle applies; one should use good habits to cure bad habits. Nature allows people to reap what they sow. Is constipation a bad habit?</p>
<p>The result of constipation: the rectum is the collection point of residual substances in the body, and poisonous gases are produced from it. The undigested water is often absorbed into the blood from here, resulting in the following symptoms: headache, dizziness, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, etc. As for the occurrence of diseases, there are the following: influenza, arthritis, neuritis, tonsillitis, vascular diseases, and more. Poor food choices can also cause constipation, and white rice, which lacks Vitamin B, is not suitable for consumption. Vitamin B is an essential element for nourishing nerves. Once it disappears or decreases, the peristalsis of the stomach and intestines decreases, and the strength of the stomach and intestines weakens. Self-treatment of constipation: (1) Choice of foods, such as vegetables, millet, fruits, are mostly mild laxatives. (2) Drinking plenty of water is a good way to prevent constipation. Drink eight to ten cups a day, or chop two or three cups before each breakfast. However, this habit should be gradually developed, starting with cold boiled water. (Note that drinking water during meals is not very suitable). (3) Medicines should not be taken regularly, but if you have suffered from constipation for a long time, taking them occasionally is also permissible. Purgatives and other stimulant laxatives should not be taken too often. Mineral oil is safer. Rectal enemas are difficult to perform often, but when constipation has been too long, they can also be performed occasionally. (4) Exercise can strengthen muscles, such as playing ball, walking, riding, etc.</p>

<h3>Don't Worry About Having No Confidants Ahead; Who Doesn't Know You in the World of Football? South China Team Embarks on a Journey; Yesterday a Group of Nineteen People Sailed South on the Guangdong; Tan Zhenhui and Jiang Gan's Farewell Suddenly Turned into a Traveler</h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) "A boat full of parting sorrow, wind and rain send off the traveler." A different kind of taste in my heart.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, it was drizzling continuously. The South China Southern Expedition football team, which had changed its departure date several times, finally set off towards the south at 4:00 PM yesterday, braving the wind and waves.</p>
<p>The selected team for this expedition, after careful consideration by Coach Mo Qing, consisted of twenty heroes.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, those who braved the rain to rush to Queen's Pier to see them off included the players' family members and friends, as well as many association officials. However, when I looked at the farewell team, I noticed that "Uncle Lu" was missing. This old man has always been enthusiastic. Every time South China goes on an expedition, he is always there to send them off and welcome them back. But this time, it was an exception.</p>
<p>I didn't hear the shouts of "Come on South China." I don't know what the players thought. I heard that this old man was a little unhappy because his son was accompanying the team without him.</p>
<p>"Fatty" Zhou, the association official, arrived late. After checking the list of those accompanying the team, Coach Mo hurried over, looking left and right, busy as could be.</p>
<p>After being dropped, Tan Zhenhui deeply sighed that he had no chance. Yesterday, he quietly mingled in the crowd of well-wishers, not saying a word, which was truly sad. However, "Heaven never bars all roads to a man." Zhou Fatty suddenly received a confidential instruction from Coach Mo and temporarily allowed Zhenhui to accompany the team. This made him laugh and cry.</p>
<p>Zhenhui said to me, "Coach Mo is truly unpredictable. I am now embarking on the journey empty-handed, without even underwear. It's really embarrassing."</p>
<p>Li Dianyou's "suspension" has not yet expired, so he couldn't go and could only welcome people for a short distance. But when the general send-off party left the "Guangdong" ship, Shuo You did not move, but remained on the ship. It is conceivable that this would touch him.</p>
<p>Zhuo Shijin's "family" came with Shijin's sister to see him off. Their reluctant farewell attracted attention. It was truly a feeling of, "I wish to plant willows along the riverbank, hoping to keep my beloved here."</p>
<p>On the small boat, Shijin said to me, "Today the waves are so big. The Guangdong is not a giant ocean liner. Once out at sea, it will inevitably suffer from seasickness." His wife heard this and secretly glanced at him, a little concerned.</p>
<p>I joked with Guo Yingqi, asking him, "How many bowls of rice will you eat on this southern tour?" He said, "I can't do it now. My stomach still hurts slightly. My appetite is not as good as before."</p>
<p>Feng "Two Years Old" drove the small boat and stepped onto the deck of the Guangdong, only to find that he had left behind a small leather bag. Before long, Xie Jinhong brought it over and returned the item to its owner. Uncle Two, out of gratitude, said he would give him at least one yuan for tea, but in the end, Uncle Two said he couldn't do it.</p>
<p>Liang Rongzhao was too busy with affairs and hadn't finished them yet, so he couldn't leave at the same time. He had to travel alone in a few days.</p>
<p>Mai Shaohan's foot was injured and he still needed to rest. He would wait for the main force to arrive in Singapore before rushing to rejoin the team. Li Huitang had also not yet accompanied the team.</p>
<p>Therefore, yesterday, only the team leader Mo Qing, official Zhou Runnian, and players Bao Jiaping, Zhang Rongcai, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Li Guowei, Guo Yingqi, Liu Qingcai, Liu Songsheng, Yang Genbao, Tan Zhenhui, Deng Guangsen, Yang Shuiyi, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Zhuo Shijin, and Luo Douwen, a total of nineteen people, departed.</p>
<p>Coach Mo said, "This itinerary will first go to Haiphong, then to Hanoi, Hue, Saigon, the Malay Archipelago, Kuala Lumpur, Johor, Singapore, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Penang, Myanmar, Yangon, Sumatra, Medan, the Dutch East Indies Batavia, Semarang, Surabaya, and then return to Hong Kong via Manila, which will take about four months. We will rush back in mid-September to participate in the next season's football league."</p>
<p>Farewell, travelers, "Don't worry about having no confidants ahead; who doesn't know you in the world of football?" Let's wait until the cool autumn in September to meet again. But I wish you a safe journey and "powerful legs."</p>
<p>On our way back, in the vast misty waters, we watched the giant Guangdong postal ship, gradually moving away from us until it disappeared.</p>
<p>Football Department Director Hao Tianlifa invited us to step onto Suolingge, a cup in hand, washing away the sorrow of parting.</p>

<h3>South China Athletic Association Resumes Holding Summer Friendly Football Tournament: Registration Begins Today, Deadline on the 15th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Exclusive] The South China Athletic Association, considering that the official Hong Kong football league has already concluded, has decided to organize a friendly football tournament during this long summer to train up-and-coming talents and provide its members with the opportunity to participate in football activities. It is noted that the Association had already held the first and second summer friendly football tournaments in 1919 and 1920. At that time, the Association was still small in scale, and membership was limited, with only four teams participating. However, the competition was already quite fierce. Now, Liu Qingxiang, Chen Guangyao, Ye Jiugao, Chen Su, Guo Baogen, Hong Renzhou, and others, who have broken free from the playing field and are renowned as famous players, all had their start at that time. Back then, South China did not yet have the Caroline Hill pitch, so all matches were held at the So Kon Po grounds. In 1921, plans were made to continue with the third tournament, but unfortunately, due to issues with the pitch, it could not be realized. Some years ago, when Lin Zhonghao was in charge of the football department, there was also a proposal to continue with a summer friendly football tournament to nurture talent. However, at that time, the Caroline Hill pitch was in urgent need of repair and the turf was being re-laid, and there was no suitable alternative pitch to borrow. Thus, the proposal to continue the tournament ultimately did not come to fruition. This year, the Association's football committee, recognizing that many members desire the opportunity to play football and also planning to organize training classes to practice formal football skills, felt that although borrowing a pitch might present some problems, for the sake of cultivating football talent and giving newcomers the opportunity to learn, it decided to continue the tournament. It also resolved to establish a Summer Friendly Football Tournament Committee to be solely responsible for its management. Many veteran football players were invited to provide sponsorship. Registration begins today, and the deadline is the 15th of the same month. In the future, after the tournament, those with better skills and diligent participation in the competition will be selected to form a training class and be trained by veteran players, with the aim of cultivating outstanding talent to serve the Association. Given the large membership of the Association, it is expected that a considerable number of people will participate, and the emergence of new talent can be predicted. The regulations of the tournament are appended below:</p>
<p>(1) Objective: The objective of this tournament is to cultivate football talent, foster camaraderie, and strengthen physical fitness.</p>
<p>(2) Eligibility: All male members of the Association who are interested in studying the art of football may register to participate.</p>
<p>(3) Team Formation: After members join, the committee will assign teams and team captains, with each team having 13 players. Once the teams are formed, they are final and no changes will be allowed. Players must faithfully serve their team to align with the Association's intention to train team members.</p>
<p>(4) System: If seven or more teams join the tournament, an elimination system will be used first. Once four teams remain, a single round-robin system will be used. If the number of participants is only sufficient to form seven teams, then the entire tournament will use a single round-robin system.</p>
<p>(5) Rules: The rules of the match will be in accordance with the existing competition rules established in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(6) Referee: The referees for each match will be appointed by the Association. All players must absolutely obey their authority to execute all judgments.</p>
<p>(7) Disputes: In the event of a dispute during the match, the referee has the right to make a decision. If the participating team is still dissatisfied, the team captain must appeal to the tournament committee within 48 hours, which will then be judged by the committee.</p>
<p>(8) Postponement: Once the competition schedule has been determined, no team may request a postponement under any circumstances, regardless of any unexpected events encountered. However, this does not apply in the event of rain or wind. The date of the make-up match will be determined by the committee.</p>
<p>(9) Time: All matches are scheduled to be held every Saturday and Sunday. After the order of play is determined, it will be sent to each team member, one copy per person. Please arrive on time to participate in the match. No further notices will be sent. If less than eight players arrive within fifteen minutes of the scheduled time, the team will be deemed unable to form a team and will be considered to have lost.

<h3>Koichiro Tanabe's Guo Moruo</h3>
<p>— Wheat Ear</p>
<p>Japanese writers or critics' articles describing foreign writers all contain the poisonous idea of Japanism. This is the arrogance and shamelessness of their so-called "bushido spirit." The spread of this germ in the Japanese literary world is the regressive behavior of Japanese fascist literary figures. Koichiro Tanabe's "Guo Moruo" in the May issue of the Japanese Review is an article containing this germ. Tanabe's praise of "Eastern culture" and "Eastern peace" is in the same tone as the Japanese fascist warlords.</p>
<p>The article is divided into four sections to describe Guo Moruo's life. It begins by saying:</p>
<p>"Guo Moruo is the giant of the Chinese literary world after Lu Xun's death. Among the new Chinese youth, he is revered as the second Lu Xun."</p>
<p>This expresses respect for Guo Moruo, but then he goes on to say:</p>
<p>"I originally did not know Guo Moruo personally. As a humanitarian of the Orient, I have secretly made profound and interesting observations on his attitude under the tragedy of this unavoidable incident, for the sake of his being a literary and intellectual figure. Why? Because of the differences between nationalities, in terms of patriotic sentiments and the ideals of human justice that transcend ethnicity and self-interest, if we were the same as Guo Moruo, in the occurrence of this unavoidable Sino-Japanese tragedy, "Eastern peace" is established on "national coexistence," and we must mutually have the will to stand up."</p>
<p>The so-called will here is in the same vein as the regressive behavior of Japanese fascist warlords. Tanabe further indicates that he does not ask whether Wang Jingwei consciously acknowledged the possibility of a Sino-Japanese cooperative body under the incident and threw himself into the anti-Japanese camp? "I am truly puzzled by Guo Moruo." Our war of resistance is for the independence of the nation, and the Japanese fascist warlords are driving the Japanese people to the battlefield to taste gunpowder, all to create their own class status. This violent behavior is not only the great enemy of the Chinese people but also the enemy of the Japanese people. For the sake of human justice and peace, we should unite to overthrow the common enemy—the Japanese warlords. Except for traitors and running dogs who are willing to act perversely, I think all peace-loving people in the world oppose this arrogant behavior of the Japanese warlords. Tanabe has no such understanding and instead blows his own horn for the warlords. How shameless!</p>
<p>However, Tanabe also quotes the following poem:</p>
<p>"Again, it is time to throw down the pen and volunteer for the army, bidding farewell to my wife and severing the lotus root threads. Tears of blood for more than ten years away from the country, boarding the ship and seeing the banners for three nights. Gladly bury my remaining bones in China; crying out my sincerity to compose this poem. Four hundred million people rush forward, with one heart and one mind, wearing the same uniform."</p>
<p>He praises this poem on his knees: "It is a magnificent poem of a patriotic person. The Japanese spirit of Bushido praises this magnificent heart while knocking on the side of the boat... His integrity to his motherland is something that any Japanese can agree with."</p>
<p>In this light, the Japanese spirit of Bushido has completely gone bankrupt. How much are the Japanese warlords trembling at our resistance!</p>
<p>In the second section of the article, he says:</p>
<p>"Guo Moruo and Yu Dafu are both giants in the Chinese literary world, but Yu Dafu is purely a writer, while Guo Moruo is not only a writer but also a thinker and even more so a scholar. When he was in exile in Japan, his research on ancient Chinese history and the study of inscriptions on bronze and oracle bone characters will become immortal achievements."</p>
<p>He also says: "From what position does Guo Moruo stand as a thinker? Although he participated in the National Revolution at the same time as the Soviet adviser Borodin, his words and actions, when spoken about communism, are better described as democratic humanism, and extremely oriental humanism. He, like Lu Xun, is a humanitarian of the Orient. He is a politician, only a poet in essence; he is a poet, but also a zealous, most simple-minded scholar of the Three Principles of the People."</p>
<p>This analysis also inevitably falls into the narrowness of Japanese fascists and does not have a sincere understanding of Guo Moruo's most glorious stance of fighting for national liberation. The so-called democratic humanism and extremely oriental humanism are nothing more than a cover for the army's praise of "Oriental culture" and "Oriental peace."</p>
<p>In the third section of the article, he provides the most detailed description of Guo's works and wants to depict his life and image through Guo's works. He says:</p>
<p>"As a literary figure, Guo Moruo has works describing his childhood life, "My Childhood," the youthful period "Black Cat," the "Fallen Leaves" depicting love with Japanese girls during his study in Japan, and the "Drifting Trilogy" depicting his life in Fukuoka after marriage! and "Ten Years of Creation" and "Northern Expedition" of the Creation Society era. These are all representative of his works."</p>
<p>Regarding "Black Cat," he commented: "The novel 'Black Cat' has scenes of tearful grief, just as Pushkin's famous work 'Broski' has a romantic beauty."</p>
<p>He commented on "Fallen Leaves" by saying, "The novel 'Fallen Leaves' is a depiction of the international love of Guo Moruo and his wife's youth, on par with Goethe's 'The Sorrows of Young Werther.' As a canon of youth, it depicts the hearts of modern Chinese young men and women."</p>
<p>Tanabe praises Guo Moruo's works, but he only praises them from the perspective of a free-minded person and a literary figure. He does not understand that Guo's works reflect Guo's life, nor does he understand that Guo's works are a description of the Chinese liberation struggle. In this section Qin, Tanabe only adheres to the idea of Japanism and does not extend to a perspective for human justice and anti-warlordism. It can be said that this is a consistent, inferior character as a Japanese writer.</p>
<p>In the fourth section, Tanabe reveals his ferocious face even more. He stubbornly supports Oriental culture and is full of the anti-European and anti-foreign ideas of the Japanese warlords. He makes the following judgment on Guo Moruo's recent actions:</p>
<p>"Guo Moruo only escaped from Japan for the sake of the fate of the 400 million people and the motherland. Now, to save the motherland and the 400 million people, and to establish the ideal of the Orient, advocating "Oriental peace" I think it is a great mission for Guo Moruo and others!"</p>
<p>What a shameless joke. The so-called "saving China and the 400 million people" is that we are striving for freedom under the invasion of Japanese fascist warlords. We must adhere to a protracted war and the final victory. Now, Japan has suffered serious resistance from our country and is collapsing day by day. The road to their destruction is right before their eyes. Tanabe, this kind of Japanese writer, guides the warlords to say "Oriental peace" and "East Asian Cooperative Body." This kind of self-deceiving madness simply loses the writer's conscience. As Mr. Guo Moruo said in "The Chinese Are Indeed Geniuses":</p>
<p>"The Chinese are indeed geniuses, and the Japanese who generally harbor ill intentions towards China are jealous of us and try their best to hinder our development. But we must not be discouraged at all, and we must not be complacent either... Let everyone make a determination and work hard."</p>
<p>This passage is indeed a powerful blow to Japanese fascist literary scholars. The Japanese fascists who are jealous of us will only see their efforts pushing them further into decline. Judging from Tanabe's "Guo Moruo," it not only shows the decline of the Japanese fascist literary world but also indicates the demise of the Japanese fascist warlords!</p>
<h3>Underground Fire</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Some people are afraid of fire, especially birds and animals. When they see fire, if they cannot extinguish it, they can only flee quickly to avoid being burned to death. If they can extinguish it, they are certainly willing to do everything in their power to eliminate it.</p>
<p>Fire originally comes from heaven, but to avoid the destruction of those who fear it, it will go underground. Thus, the fire we see today is hiding underground, temporarily stopping the scene of blazing flames and burning all filth in the world. The triumph of the destroyer is naturally imaginable.</p>
<p>Originally, fire is lively, clever, and also intense. The Holy Spirit of God is also represented by it. It is unwilling to be easily sacrificed under the foul arts of the destroyers. It can temporarily reduce its flames, and it can slightly restrain its angry steps. If it is forced too hard, it can hide deep underground.</p>
<p>Underground, it found abundant coal, any fuel that can increase its power. Not only will it not be extinguished, but it will become more intense. It constantly seeks opportunities to come out and burn the hands, feet, and any part of the limbs of the destroyers, melting away any traces of evil on the ground. Once the time is ripe, it will explode with a bang, shaking the heavens and the earth, and returning to the surface.</p>
<h3>Fame</h3>
<p>— Wen Ge</p>
<p>Life is ordinary, and how long does human life last? Some people sigh, unwilling to spend their lives in silence. They frown and an idea comes to mind, feeling that they can do a great career and leave a "name" in people's minds. Therefore, people have one more task: in addition to seeking profit, they also seek fame. With fame, one can be known in one's time and be passed on to future generations, so that when people hear it, they will be respectful and fearful. Achieving both fish and bear's paw in one fell swoop is a great thing.</p>
<p>Fame is dead, and to have fame, one must seek it. The methods of seeking it are nothing more than drilling, flattering, and praising. I am learning how to drill, flatter, and praise. The specific procedures cannot be said, but fortunately, I have heard and seen some of the benefits of these successes, so I might as well say them for everyone to hear, saving the arduous journey of hiding them on famous mountains.</p>
<p>Assuming that your name can be known in your time, then you will be able to handle everything with ease, often sailing with the wind. For example, if you are a famous writer in the north and south, that is really amazing. Not only will readers admire you, but even editors will prostrate themselves before you. Therefore, people will snatch your articles like rare treasures. Needless to say, paper will be expensive in Luoyang. In this way, you can occasionally put on airs, being evasive, dealing with a group of manuscript pullers to increase people's belief in your great name, until it reaches the highest level. After that, even if you have bad works, you don't have to worry about them not finding a way out.</p>
<p>The benefits of a writer having a name are not only this. Of course, there are others. If you are tired of being a writer and want to change careers, that is very easy. You can be whatever you want, as long as you and your words reach the right place.</p>
<p>What applies to writers can be extended to wealthy merchants, who can also use a good name to increase their profits? Can the gentlemen of the "Hua Wei" type not use fame to leap onto the political stage? Fame has so many uses, so there are many people in the world who are busy seeking fame, so some people will shake their heads and wag their tails, saying: "The use of fame is great!"</p>
<p>But people are bound to die. If you, the famous writer, die, I think it will be different from ordinary people. Not only will people mourn or commemorate you, but even the government will issue an order to commend you, write a biography, send it to the National History Museum, and issue some funeral expenses. All of these are because you are famous. As for what happens later, there are naturally many benefits. Let's not talk about others, your great name can always be passed down for hundreds of millions of years with the records of history and the legends of people. So at that time, even though you are dead, you should still be grateful for yourself, because there are thousands of nameless "Ah Q"-style mediocrities who have no one to tell their stories, but you are unique, which is truly a world of difference!</p>
<p>If we extend this further, can the wealthy merchants and the "Hua Wei" type of people not also fight for posthumous honor by relying on the power of fame?</p>
<p>Fame has so many benefits, great! It can benefit you in your lifetime and extend to your descendants. Great gentlemen who love fame, why don't you come!</p>
<p>However, be sure not to fall victim to the poison of "people are afraid of becoming famous, and pigs are afraid of becoming fat," because these are threats from famous people who want to limit you from coming.</p>
<h3>Black Glasses and Icy Refreshments</h3>
<p>— Jia Li</p>
<p>The moment you see this title, you immediately feel: Summer has arrived.</p>
<p>The scorching sun beats down on people, irritating their eyes, causing sweat to flow down like rain, so people shout: "It's hot! It's hot!"</p>
<p>To protect their eyes from irritation, people wear sunglasses. To sweat less, they eat icy refreshments!</p>
<p>But these two things, on the surface, seem to belong to summer, but they are not necessarily so. Usually, in spring or winter, you can see these two things. For example, if you have an eye disease, you naturally have to wear sunglasses. When you feel "feverish" in a dance hall or theater, you naturally want to eat icy refreshments.</p>
<p>"Wearing a fur coat in June" is said to be a joke, so isn't eating icy refreshments in winter a joke? But jokes, even though they are jokes, still exist. Taking wearing sunglasses as an example, it is the same principle. Wearing sunglasses because of an eye disease is for "protection." Wearing sunglasses to avoid sunlight irritation is also for "protection." Why is wearing sunglasses considered to be summer? These are all incomprehensible questions. What is incomprehensible is a joke, and jokes are all incomprehensible.</p>
<p>However, we are very clear about this point: no matter how incomprehensible a problem is, if it exists, there is always a reason for it (whether it is right or wrong). And when we wear sunglasses and eat icy refreshments in the summer, not only are they not incomprehensible, but they have "definite" reasons. All of the above have been explained one by one, so there is no need to be verbose.</p>
<p>However, because they are not "jokes," their reasons cannot be without question, which is quite true... Wearing sunglasses in summer is to avoid sunlight irritation, and eating icy refreshments is to sweat less, but these are all caused by external blows. Because there is no resistance, these things are used as shields. As for wearing sunglasses and eating icy refreshments at ordinary times, they are all for reasons desired from the heart. Lacking resistance and using such things as shields is really not allowed to exist.</p>
<p>Therefore, wearing sunglasses and eating icy refreshments at ordinary times, because they come from the heart and are different from others, although they are "jokes," they are quite fashionable and elegant. On the contrary, wearing sunglasses and eating icy refreshments in the summer is not considered fashionable or elegant, but merely a sign of weakness, a "joke."</p>
<h3>Native Accent</h3>
<p>— Tie</p>
<p>She also said: "Although I received all the letters you sent in the past, every letter was always accompanied by three Korean secret agents, perhaps mixed with a Japanese person, saying that you were a soldier in China, resisting 'Manchukuo' and resisting Japan, and that your family were all anti-Japanese elements, passing news to China." "My letters are very simple!" "Well, even if it's blank paper, he says you use all codes." "We have Japanese people in our family, doesn't our × have a Japanese wife? Aren't we truly supporting Great Japan and being its obedient citizens?" "Enough! What's so great about Japanese women? They are also abused by Japanese soldiers and are not much stronger than us." Japanese militarists not only trample on the Chinese people but also oppress their own people.</p>
<p>"So every time you send a letter, you not only have to ask for favors but also spend a lot of money to lobby, fortunately avoiding unexpected difficulties." "There are still unexpected things?" "Alas! It's really tearful to mention this. Last May, Tao Juren received a letter from Hankou, with 300 yuan attached, which was his old friend repaying a debt from many years ago. Everyone knew about this, but the Japanese thought it was to support the Volunteer Army and imprisoned him. Our county magistrate—the chairman of the maintenance association during the 1918 Incident, who later became the puppet county magistrate—came out to vouch for him. They said that the county magistrate was in collusion with the Volunteer Army, and as a result, the county magistrate was imprisoned for three years, and Tao Juren died. This was his friend's conscience repaying the money, but who knew it would be fatal? Later, his property was confiscated, and his son became a beggar."</p>
<p>Tao Juren was a wealthy man in our county, a very kind person, always responsive to requests. Everyone nearby called him "Old Good Man." In the year of the Incident, general vagrants burned everywhere, but Tao Juren was not harmed. Poor people all remember his kindness, but now he has come to this end.</p>
<p>"Last year, when scrap copper was collected, there was random beating. Even if you had an axe or a brazier at home, you had to send it to the village office. Once an order was given, who dared to disobey? Now there is only a kitchen knife left in the house. Where can you see the shadow of copper and iron? Even with kitchen knives, only one is allowed per household!" "So fierce?" "You still have this dismissive tone, we are like startled birds!"</p>
<p>"Grain stalks were collected, 20 catties from each household, and 5 catties from each elementary school student. Once the order was given, they were all sent to the county seat within ten days. Strangely, even Ji Sen, who had not paid taxes for more than ten years, did not dare to fall behind. Every household not only sent the prescribed amount but also brought a few catties more, for fear that the person weighing it would say they were short and slap them."</p>
<p>"Public bonds are raised. I don't know how many public bonds have been issued. They are sent to households one by one. The name is fundraising, but they are actually forcing you to buy a hundred. Who dares to buy ninety-nine? Everyone knows that public bonds are waste paper. Who doesn't bitterly pray to heaven, hoping that the national army will recover the lost land and return to the embrace of the motherland!"</p>
<p>"I heard that various donations will be increased this year. As for how to explain this 'voluntary donation,' only heaven knows."</p>
<p>Later, I asked her about the Zhanggufeng Incident. How did the Northeast newspapers report it? She said that Northeast newspapers never reported the Changkufeng Incident or the Mutugou Incident. I asked her about the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan! "The newspapers praise Japanese victories every day. Who believes it! Even the Taierzhuang battle, the newspapers did not report the Chinese victory. I don't know who spread it, but everyone knows about it, and they talk about it with great interest."</p>
<p>"Recently, they are going to levy again. The household registration check is too strict. Those without household registration cannot return, and those with household registration cannot leave. Even we women are strictly checked. Counting from the time I boarded the ship in Tianjin to leave home, I went through seven inspections and interrogations, especially at the Tianjin International Bridge, which was the most dangerous. It can be considered a narrow escape."</p>
<p>Ah! ××××××× seizes our money, collects our iron, drinks ××××!</p>
