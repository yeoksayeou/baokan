<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>中蘇兩國對世界和平所負的責任</h3>
<p>二十餘個月以來的日本侵華戰爭，因為我們中國的堅强抵抗，已經造成日本進退維谷的形勢，這是全世界都已經明瞭的事實，毋庸再加以詳細的說明了。最近二月十日，日本又突然轉變方向，向海南島進攻，這個舉動，是日本軍閥野心的更深一層的暴露。海南島是中國南端雷州半島外邊的一個島，面積和台灣相似，而距安南約百哩，北距廣州灣約四十哩，隅着南海，和菲律賓相對峙。他的位置，旣足以控制南海和東京灣，並且切斷香港和新加坡的通路。從日本的觀點上說，日本往澳洲，往南洋，往印度以至往歐洲都必須經過海南島。所以日本處心積慮想取得海南島，以作為日本南向的門戶，以便控制安南，印度，南洋，菲律賓以至檀香山，幾十年來，未會放鬆過。此辭日本向我國的侵略戰爭擴大到現在的地步，旣以基于日本軍閥對於我國估計的錯誤，以致消耗了他陸空軍的戰鬥力，至少是三分之二，而我們中國反愈戰愈强，已經註定了他們的失欺。祇因為我國缺乏海軍，所以還能讓他保留住海軍的大部力量，未曾使用。這次進攷海南島，一方面是利用他僅存的一部份力量，對我國做最後的威脅，一方面也是利用歐洲局面的不安，向英法挑釁。旣可以為他在歐洲的與國德意聲援，也希望僥倖完成幾十年來攫取海南島控制南太平洋的好夢。蔣委員長說：「日軍今年之進窺海南島，卽等於一九三一年九月十八日之佔領瀋陽。換言之，日本之進攻海南島，無異造成太平洋上之九一八。』對於日本軍閥的野心，可謂一語破的。所以中日戰爭到目前這一個階段上，已開始一個新的意義。這個新的意義就是說，日本已經開始向世界進攻。</p>
<p>我現在所以要向蘇聯人民說話，因為蘇聯是一個愛好和平的國家。不但愛好和平，並且有維護世界和平的志願。蘇聯幾年以來，在國際聯盟以及其他國際方面的努力，都已經作這種志願最確切的證明。我們中國，一樣是一個愛好和平的國家，一樣具有維護世界和平的志願。不幸我國多年以來，受帝國主義的梏桎，辛亥革命以後，二十餘年，尙未能積極建設，以敎空抱這種志願，而對於世界和平的貢献，非常的少、這次日本帝國主義者無端地向我們大舉侵略，我們不惜以全國人的血肉，做堅强不屈的抵抗，使帝國主義者明白認識人道正義一類的名詞，畢竟不是處無飄渺東西：而逞强逞霸的野心家，終必自食其報。我們所給與日本帝國主義者這個合理的囘答，至少也可以說是已經担任了維護世界和平的前哨工作，中蘇兩國，旣然同為愛好和平的國家，同具有維護世界和平的志願，而在地理歷史上，又具有深切的關係，為實現中蘇兩國共具的志願，實有共同努力之必要。過去二十個月日本向中國進攻，蘇聯的政府和人民，旣已予中國以莫大的同情各援助　現在日本已開始他的侵略的新意義，向世界進攻，中蘇兩國所負的任務，更為重大。我相信蘇聯的政府和人民對於日本這個侵略的新意義，也一定更為注意。</p>
<p>日本是西太平洋上一個島國。五十年前，和中國一樣是個被侵略的國家。一八九四年中日戰爭裏，獲得了勝利，才開始取得國際地位。後來又利用英國，成立英日同盟，隨卽於一九零四發動日俄戰爭，而打勝了帝俄。這兩次嘗試的成功，竟把日本引入了瘋狂的狀熊裏，處心積慮要完成其所謂大陸政策的迷夢。關菸大陸政策的內容，和目的，說得最透切的，是田中義一的奏摺。田中奏摺說：「將來欲制中國，必以打倒美國為先决問題。這是與日俄戰爭的意義，大同小異。然欲征服中國，必先征服滿蒙。欲征服世界，必先征服中國。倘中國完全可以被我征服，其他如小亞細亞及印度南洋等處，必長我敬我而至於降我。使世界知東亞為我國之東亞，永無向我侵犯的大膽。此乃明治大帝之遺策，亦卽我日本帝國之生存上所不可不做之事也。』可是日本的大陸政策，就是征服世界的政策。本來三十年（從一九零二到一九二一）的英日同盟，前半段是對俄，後半段是對美。因為日本征服世界的政策，以征服中國為第一步。一八九四年的中日戰爭，因俄國的千涉，而退遠遼東半島，日人旣恨之刺骨。日俄戰後，日本旣已窺破帝俄內容的空虛，元足深畏；而美國又適有維持中國門戶開放的主張，對於日本獨吞中國的野心，又予以重大的打擊，所以日本在這個時期裏，就拼命拉着英國以自重，而以應付其獨吞中國的障礙！俄美為目標。一九二一年華盛頓會議裏，雖然因美國之壓迫，而取消英日同盟，但日本在歐戰期間，乘各國不暇東顧，已向中國和其他方面，取得很多特殊利益，羽翼已成，所以近年以來，竟不顧一切地向我國直接進攻，而尤以九一八後為甚。不過我國並非一個可以輕侮的國家，旣具有五千年的民族歷史，而近年革命運動進展，已經把我國一切一切，推進到一個新的階段，很淸楚地認識自身對於自已國家民族，和對於世界所負的使命；絕不允許侵略者如此猖在下去。所以從蘆溝橋第一聲炮響，就立刻發動全國人力物六抵抗起來。固然是為保障自已國家民族的獨立生存，也是為世界和平而戰。</p>
<p>我現在所要說明的，是日本對於征服世界一貫的迷夢，並未因我國二十個月以來所給予他的打擊而驚醒。最近轉變方向，對世界進攻，就是明證。不過就日本的國力和所處的國際形勢上，是孤注一擲的辦法罷了。就日本的國力說，在目前歐局緊張的時侯，以僅存的海軍力量，向英法兩國遠東海軍做冒險的試探，他是有膽量的。而在國際形勢上，德意雖號稱為他的與國，但自身陷于歐局的變動，並且對於遠東的關係較淺，也未必願意，甚至沒有力量對日本加以支持。而况日本自身的矛盾，已經捉襟見肘，卽使他甘冒天下之大不建發動向世界的進攻，他的前途是不可想像的。我們知道，惟有和平才是人類眞正的福音。現在世界上大部份的國家，甚至包括少數野心家所統治的人民，都是站在和平陣綫上，我們就可以斷言人道正義終究是不可抹滅的名詞，而世界和平終究有實現之一日。</p>
<p>實現世界和平的責任，究竟應該由誰來負呢？我們中國和日本侵略者巳經周旋了二十餘個月，事實上已經消滅了日本陸軍和空軍三分之二的力量，這當然是巳經給日本帝國主義者以極嚴重的打擊。蘇聯在地理上，旣和日本密切地接觸着，而愛好和平，和維護世界和平的志願，又復興中國相同；從國力方面說，又具有充實的力量，至少在遠東風狂雨驟的狀况之下，是立於一個最重要的地位。目前日本帝國主義者向世界挑戰的路綫，雖似有由進攻海南島而南向的趨勢，但從他征服世界的一貫的野心上看，南進北進，都不過程序的問題。我們為擁護人道正義，為維持世界和平，絕不容許這種野心家存在，原不必注意他首先進攻的方向。我們衹願世界上一切愛好和平的國家和人民，共同負起予打擊者以打擊的責任：而在目前遠東烽火正旺的時侯，尢其希望於與遠東存有密切關係的蘇聯。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間　從廿八年五月十四日至二十日</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>這一週間的世界情勢，恰好用到『春雲初展』四個字，給我們帶來了許多可喜的消息。最較重要的，是英蘇談判之續有進展，英美友誼關係的增強，英美法各國對鼓浪嶼和上海租界事件的採取示威行動，和全世界援華制日運動的熱烈等等。而我們堅持進行中的抗日戰爭，又有新的勝利，尤其是鄂中和華北我軍的勝利，使日×遭受了十分嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>另一方面，德意兩個法西斯侵略國家，仍在準備更進一步的投機和冒險的戰爭，遠東××的日本法西斯，則更在窘極無聊之中，開始向英美大送秋波，而在暗中，則正準備着更毒辣的進攻。不過從大體上說起來，在反侵略運動日漸鞏　與發展之下，法西斯侵略者在今日確已遭遇到他們所未會想像得到的困難了。我們如果能够以更大的努力，克服反侵略陣線內依舊存在的弱點，加緊反對侵略的實際鬥爭，增進侵略者內在與外來的困難危掛；則二次世界大戰尙可消泯，而我們所祈求着的眞正和平也可以提前實現！</p>
<p>（一）反侵略運動的進展</p>
<p>反法西斯反侵略運動，在這一週間，一巳有較大的進展，表現在具體事實上的：第一是英國和土耳其當局，同於十二日宣佈决定成立　定。此種協定的具體條件，據稱尙在繼續談判，原則上是當一旦因有侵略行為而致地中海地帶發生戰事之時，英土兩國準備有效的合作，互予對方以一切援助及接濟。緊接着這個消息之後，法土兩國互助協定，亦有在短期內公佈的傳說，這種傳說出諸法國負責方面，其可信成份自然不少。本月十七日，蘇聯與士耳其成立秘密協定的消息，也已傳遍世界，據稱內容是：（一）任何侵略情事，凡足以破壤巴爾幹半島現狀的，蘇土兩國當合作對抗；（二）若有戰事發生，蘇土兩國應將一切資源力量合作應付。土耳其在地形上，不僅掌握着黑海與地中海的鎖鑰，並且控制着地中海經紅海到印度洋的歐亞交通咽喉，英法蘇土各國的密切聯合反抗侵略，不僅對於東南歐和近東各地，而且對於遠東以至全世界，也都有其重大意義的。第二，是英國和蘇聯的台作互助談判，經過一度優持之後，在本週內又呈進展形勢。十七日英外相哈里法克斯的與蘇大使邁斯基等再度曾談以後，英國答覆蘇聯的新牒文，於十八日送抵英斯科。據稱英國在原則上業已接受亙助的建議，答允在蘇聯因保衛波蘭羅馬尼亞與土耳其而遭受攻襲時，出而援助蘇聯，卽以英法兩國軍力財力等資源供給蘇聯，不過英國拒絕在目前將保陣伸展至波羅的海。蘇聯當卽於十九日覆文英方，堅持先行訂立英法蘇三國互助協定，然後可以保證東歐各國，以免授法西斯侵略者以可乘之隙，而使英國的反侵路運動成為一種罪惡的騙局。現在英國有遠見的政界人士和法國當局，都在力促英政府從連成立協定，大約在下週就可有較明白的結論了。第三，是英美友誼關係亦續有增進，這幾天英王英后在加拿大大受歡迎，歡呼之聲終日不絕，而美國人民尤一致響應英方與論，願以英王英后之來加來美而增進英國與美洲的友善關係，同時英政府方面亦决意實行英美物物交換以捉進兩國邦交。英美合作，對於歐洲尤其是遠東，有非常重要的意義，我們要靈力促其實現。</p>
<p>（二）德意日本的新活動</p>
<p>法西期侵略者有其新的活動，它們一面正在加緊破壞反法西斯反侵略運動，一面又在加緊佈置新的帝國主義大戰（一）關於前者，他們採取了兩種方法，第一，還是煽動與勾引小國，最近表現在事實上的是意國之策動保加利亞與希臘和南期拉夫的衝突，（見十三日海通社布達　斯電）；是意國之勾引南期拉夫，（見十三日海通社羅馬電「南國攝政謁見敎皇」）；是挑撥保加利亞與羅馬尼亞的糾紛而從中拉攜（見十三日路透社倫敦電），是德意兩國在商業上竭力獲取羅馬尼亞；（見十四日海通社柏林電：「德羅巳成立商約」十八日路透社羅馬電「意羅成立物之交換協定」）是勾引南斯拉夫加入德意軸心（見十九日路國；對芬蘭，瑞典，挪威三國，雖已挫敗，（十七日路透社電稱該三國拒絕德國建議），而對丹麥，愛沙尼亞及拉特維亞的談判，則有「完成」之說（見十八日路透社柏林電）。第二，是破壞英法美互助協定談判，而集中力量於煽動及威脅英國政府中的頑固份子反動份子，英國對蘇談判迄今未能傾其誠意成立互助協定，所受頑固及反動份字之制肘者亦屬不小。而最近日本亦竟對英美大送秋波，十七日英國衆院卽曾討論到日本企區與英國訂立不侵犯條約的事件，日外相有田更於十八日在送別美駐日大使時表示日本解决美日縣案，不妨碍美國在華權益的「誠意」，而勸美國不要採取國際合作等形式。（二）關於後者，在本週表現於事實的，第一就有德意軸心的加緊團結。意外長齊亞諾將於今天（廿一日）到達柏林，定於明日正式簽訂政治軍事協定，而意王愛麥虞於軍約簽訂後，亦將到柏林，以增强侵略者軸心的團結，柏林巳在準備盛大歡迎。第二則是德國對於波蘭的威脅是更加嚴重了，大批德軍，業已集中於波蘭邊境摩拉維亞地區；而據十八日哈瓦斯社倫敎電，則謂德國納粹黨軍隊數千人，內有三千人為希特勒銜隊，已經秘密混入但澤。另傳德軍開到但澤的已達二萬之衆。第三，是希特勒與墨索里尼都於十六日巡視各國沿法國邊境一帶的防綫。而兩國軍事工程刻正在加工趕造中。第四，是準備與四班牙訂立軍事同盟，實際上則準備在西班牙加緊布置西法邊境與直布羅陀的軍事工作，準備威脅法英兩國，十九日西班牙在德意兩國驅策下舉行祝「捷」大會，實可看做侵略者對英法美各民主和平國家的示威，也正是對一切偽善的怯懦的妥協政策的殘酷的獰笑！</p>
<p>總結這一週的時事，可以看到法西斯侵略　確已遭受新的困難，但是他們正在進行更殘酷與惡毒的陰謀！</p>
<p>（三）英美法對日大示威</p>
<p>隨着反侵略運動的進展，隨着遠東××投機冒險的日益猖狂，英美法等民主和平各國，終於採取了比較强硬的步驟來對付日×的挑釁了，第一步是為對付日×强佔鼓浪嶼，英美法三國駐遠東軍艦，各派水兵於十七日在鼓浪嶼登陸，總數與在該地登陸的日水兵勢均力敵，英海軍司令諾貝爾並對日×發出嚴重警告，不能對鼓浪嶼工部局有所變更。現傳日水兵已偷偷撤離該地。第二步是為對付日×之準備劫奪上海及天津漢口各地租界地英美法當局於十九日在上海公共租界與法租界實施緊急戒嚴，駐軍，探捕，萬國商團實行　出動，漫界各處亦增設鐵絲網等』如臨大故，在日×尙未發動武裝刦奪之前，實行對日大示威。這種緊急行動，可說是自從日×實行全面排擊歐美列强在遠東勢力以來，英美法三國第一次的有力的共同一致的答覆，這種答覆表明了英美法各國對於日×所謂「東亞新秩序」的堅决的反對，和保衛其在華在遠東權益的决心。無怪日×當局聞而警惶了—連日日本各報已多表示皇惑的文字，而日外務省發言人更於十九日對此事宣稱為「極可悲痛」了！不通我們仍須在這裏明白指出三點：即第一，日×之謀劫奪租界與排斥歐美列强在遠東勢力，　係依據於日本資本帝國主義發展的必要與其建立東亞霸權的國策，今後與歐美列强矛盾祇會發展，絕難調和；今日則為解救其侵華軍事政治經濟的嚴重困難而更加緊其刦奪步驟，除了遭受致命的打擊，絕對不會中止或退讓的。第二，英美法目前這種共同行動與示威，還不是足予日×以致命打擊的力量，而且如查禁援助中國的譯報、文匯、大美，中美各報，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，以及種種干涉中國人一切合法的愛國言論與行動如懸掛國旗等，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。第三，為英美法各友邦的本身利益和遠東眞正和平計，今日各友邦應即繼續對日大示威之後，立卽進一步協商政治軍事經濟的密切合作，採取更廣泛更切實的援華制日的步驟，壓迫日×放棄投機胃險的法西斯侵略政策，而要求其切實成功，首先是要中國抗日戰爭之取得决定的勝利。如果沒有中國抗戰勝利做根據，則一切和平的保證，都不能孤立存在的。</p>
<p>（四）國際援華運動熱烈</p>
<p>反法西斯反侵略運動的進展，實際上就是大有助益於我國抗戰建國的。而目前蘇聯之堅决主張締結英法蘇三國互助協定，堅决主張反侵略戰綫應包括遠東，及其努力進行與近東各國和對美合作，所有這些，更是大有助益於我們抗戰建國的。此外，最近一週來國際援華運動，亦有新的表現，在美國方面，我振委會代表于斌主敎在美國大受華僑及美國朝野人士的歡迎，于主敎的抗戰宣傳工作獲得極大的收獲。全美三大主敎之一的費城總主敎刀和地並發起歡迎于主敎，且諭示全區敎友，應一律盡心蜴力，授助與救濟中國難民。又據十六日哈瓦期社華盛頓電，美國國會方面對中國態度極為友好，絕不致通過任何足以妨礙中國抗戰的中立法或其他法案。至於美國廣大勞工，則一致願為援助中國抗戰制裁日本侵略而奮鬥。在英國，最近援華運動尤為熱心，史奈爾，薛西爾及里斯多威爾三貴族等所組成的代表團，於十九日訪外相哈立法克斯，敦請英國政府在日內瓦會議席上，用盡英國之力，務使國聯採取積極行動以援助中國。英國議院方面對於援華制日，連日均有熱烈討論。而中英文化協會於十六日在重慶舉行第四屆年會，英籍會長卡爾主席演說，欽佩我國人堅持抗戰精神，並認中英兩國關係、必日臻密切。法國方面、對日×態度亦轉强硬，如十九日重慶法使館消息，法政府代表團已東來調查海防改自由港，並將准予滇越鐵路於大量運輸以種種方便。此外各國對於×機最近在華暴行，一致痛斥，蘇聯英美法各國朝野人士，均先後來電慰問，反侵略總會會長薛西爾爵士亦來電慰問，並向我上下一至英勇抗戰表示敬禮，且稱堅信×必被我擊退，勉我全國加强團結統一，堅持持久抗戰。</p>
<p>國際人士之熱烈援華，是我們英勇堅持二十二月的結果。今後當然要更加團結堅持抗戰，以爭取國際更多更大的同情援助，而提前實現抗戰勝利。但是我們回顧過去對外宣傳，尤其是國民外交工作，的確還是非常不夠的。目前抗戰進入新的嚴重階段，我們不能不加倍努力於此。國聯行政院開會在即，我駐英大使郭泰祺於十九日偕蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基同赴日內瓦，當經巴黎時，將與我駐法大使顧維鈞一同代表我國出席。我們今日一高要督　政府　　　　　　　　我國代表加倍努力，一面嫵要展開國民外交，推　各　政府出席代表，務求達到各國對日實施有效壓力，與切實援助我國的目的！</p>
<p>（五）抗日戰爭一週形勢</p>
<p>這一週的戰事的重心，仍在湖北河南一帶，尤其在湖北襄陽樊城以東一帶，但是我們在華北和華東，尤其是華北各地，戰事亦非常激烈。華南方面的戰事，則仍在珠江三角洲激烈進行，不過雙方都沒有重大發展。一週來鄂豫我軍連戰連捷，不僅打破了×人「包圍我二十個師」的夢囈，而目經過鄂北豫南兩週血戰，使×傷亡共有一萬七八千人，　達其華中侵略主力部隊全額的三分之一，據中央社干五日洛楊電我軍此次克復唐河，僅一夜之酣戰，竟斃傷×千人之多！現在×人侵奪襄樊的計劃，大致已被粉碎。在鄂豫我軍已經實現主動作戰，控制全局，繼續在隨州，棗陽以北，桐柏新野以南地帶與×激戰。情勢已可樂觀。其次，華北方面，一週來我軍又獲重大勝利，據十八日路透社北平電稱，我第八路軍挺進熱河省內的各支隊，現正與日軍激戰。河北省中部地區，游擊隊勢力更與日俱增，今春侵入各該地區的日軍，已迫得全部總撤退。平漢路東雖尙有若干村莊為日軍佔據，但已陷困守，失去發制各地能力。綏遠戰事近來亦甚激烈，，四五月間兩星期內，卽已璣×近千，而平綏，平漢，各路，戰事亦繼續發生。東部戰場，戰事亦有進展。蘇北我軍，並再度於十六日晚衝入徐州，焚燬×偽機關。津浦，滬杭，蘇嘉，京杭，京蕪各綫沿路，亦隨時發生戰爭，如滬杭蘇嘉路間我軍，卽於十五日晚衝入桐鄉，痛剿×　。華南方面上週白主任崇禧將軍巡視粵北召開重要會議以後，進一步的反攻軍事已在逐漸開展。據十九日韶關通訊，粵境我軍現一面反攻，一面加強力量，東江×軍毫無所逞，北江之×紛起反戰，增城從化之×屢有被嫌而繳械禁閉的。西江下游，×仍未退，江會一帶激戰雖會城得而復失，但仍被我控制，江門附近我軍，且已推進杜阮　莊。珠江三角洲之×，如無增援部隊續到，顯已成為强弩之末了。</p>
<p>總觀全局，×人雖然傾其全力以窺襄樊，以圖奠定其進攻西北的根據，但是因為它的兵力仍舊不能進行新的大規模的進攻，而各種困難又在繼續增加，所以主要目的，還是悄極性的在企圖打擊我前綫的反攻，加强其佔領區的控制與統治，再準備將來的大舉進攻。而×人之力圖　奪上海等地租界，與在鼓浪嶼登陸，一方面固然在於排斥歐美列强在遠東勢力，另二方面則在企圖予我一切×後戰鬥以政治上經濟上的打擊，更便利其對於佔領區的控制。今後×人對於平漢粵漢兩路以及潮汕經韶關至湘桂各路，似有首先發動大規模攻勢的可能。</p>
<p>我們在這裏所不能忽視的還有兩點：卽第一，對×，還要估計到，現在有三種力量在阻止×人的前進，第一是我軍前綫戰鬥力的增强，第二是英美法聯合對日的示威，第三是日本經濟危機的嚴重。對我，則還要估計到在內外情勢激趨有利之際，仍有不少阻碍，卽（一）汪××的××××行動雖遭失敗，而一切汪系××，動搖份子，頑固份子的妥協與反　的錯誤念頭則尙未澈底肅淸，所以精神動員，團結統一，持久抗戰，尙有待於更廣泛更深入的宣傳。（二）阻　全民族力量總動員與國際援華制日運動的勢力與傾向之繼續存在與發展，也是在目前抗戰新的嚴重階段所急須注意的事實，我們必須加緊推進政治的進步，以實現民主精神改善民衆生活擴大國際宣傳作為爭取勝利的基本工作，卽如本週結束的全國生產會議，如要求其决議之認眞實現與切實增進生產建設，支持抗戰建國，亦非注意上述基本工作不可！</p>

<h3>生產會議宣言（四）</h3>
<p>資本　吸收游資</p>
<p>農林工礦交通五者，為今後國家經濟建設之主張、不揣愚陋、而一一陳之。於茲尙有數事，雖非生產事業之本身，而實為發展生產所必須注意者，敬為國人告焉。其一為資本，貿易與金融。我國以農立國，生產資本，積儲本　，當此促進生產之日，資本之需要，至民鉅大，於發展國家資本，運用工商資本以外，必須吸收游資，以收集腋成裘之效果，而吸牧游資之方法，則莫善於合作事機之推廣，不但可以集合資金，更可於無形中對農民施以生產運銷之敎育，及减輕商人對於農民之剝削</p>
<p>貿易統制</p>
<p>生產專業，必賴商業以周轉，二者不但相輔以相成，而其發展之程度，又往往比例以并進，我國於商業政策，因廣大農村之需要，對於小商人應格外扶持，政府稅捐，亦應酌量減輕，以示體恤與獎勵。國際貿易，吾人不惟在戰時主張　營，更望今日之統制政策，逐潮嚴密，以樹立戰後國營國際貿易之基礎。</p>
<p>金融機構</p>
<p>金融流通為生產事業之命脉，必須適應農工商界之需要。政府十餘年努力之結果，上層金融機構，逐漸完密，惟地方金融機構，則尙待繼續調整，雖經兩次地方金融會議之改營，但尙未臻健全境地。抗戰以來，政府堅持避免通貨膨脹政策，此種謹嚴　度，吾人實不勝敬佩。但今後生產事業，旣日益擴大，則法幣數量，必求適應生產事業之需求，亦為事理之所宜。更望發揮銀行之效能，透成短期資金之源泉，發揮信託與儲蓄之效能，以造成中期資金之源泉。發揮壽險之效能，以造成長明資金之源泉。蓋現代生產發達之國家莫不以銀行，信託，儲蓄，壽險四大金剅事業，為　成與擴大民族資金之方法與保障民族生產事業安全之護符也。</p>
<p>勞工</p>
<p>利用人力</p>
<p>其二為勞工。欲求生產事業之發展，必須運用吾國天賦之特長。吾人之機械與技術，雖遠較歐美為遜，然苟能善於運用，四萬五千萬之廣大勞動羣衆，改良現有生產方法，亦禾嘗不可以彌補機械不足之缺憾。吾人之為此言，絕非故步自封，遺忘工業近代化之方法，徒以運輸不便，國外之機械旣不能大量運輸，勢不可因望梅而廢解渴，且此種生產方法，雖不如機械生產之便利，但亦有其優點。即不致如機械生產之易，使產業界掀起强烈之波動，而有多數工人失業之患也。</p>
<p>救濟失業</p>
<p>兩年以來，戰區各業相備殘破，多數工人，陷於失業之苦境，同時後方生產事業，又因技術工人之缺乏，而感覺極大之困難，發生無限之浪費，其由戰區遷移後方之工人，又因失於調整，多不事生產，或担任不適宜之工作，致無從盡其才能，此皆國家人材之浪費，亦卽生產發展之障碍。本會同人以為政府對於戰區及游擊區之生產事業，固應特別重視，同時對於後方技術工人之調查與調整，及設法招徠　區之技術工人，以避免×人之利用，亦慮予以特別注意。</p>
<p>勞資糾紛為近代一大問題。此問題之正當解决，不惟繫乎社會秩序之安寧，亦月有關國家生產力之培養。工資待遇，應力求合理，以造成勞資雙方之團結與台作。他如職業介紹所之設立，勞資仲裁之實行，以及工人衛生之設備，皆一一舉辦，以日　民生主義之理想。其在農業方面，吾人認為政府應畫力扶持自耕小農，使其生活優裕，更認為應設法使各地佃農逐慚獨立，以實現本黨耕者有其田之理想，與樹立國家堅實之基礎也。</p>
<p>教育</p>
<p>技術人材</p>
<p>其三，為生產教育。生產教育，為生產人材之源泉，百年樹人，事不容緩，歐美各，為發展生產之基本。說者謂歐戰前德國工業之日進無疆，及其戰後復興之迅速，皆以其大量之技術工人，為主要因素，蓋苟非如此，卽有完善之設備興鉅額資之本，亦將因運用不善，而消耗浪費于無形也。中國今日之缺憾，不僅高級專門人才之缺乏，而尤在於低級技術工人之不足，政府當局，應嚴密考慮國家所需技術工人之種類與數量，實施大規模之生產敎育，以為迅速之補救。現有各級學校之敎材，須重新改編，務使各級學校之敎育，皆與生產事業發生緊密之聯繫，庶可敎不虛施，而才有所用，以達到建敎合作之目的。更因一般人民之貧窮與政府財力之有限，於正學校規以外，尤應注重補習學校之設立，農業推廣及工廠實　之舉行，予一般人民以求學　之便利。婦女敎育，亦須依此原則，充分推廣，使全國婦女皆有接受生產敎育之機會。我中國二萬萬數千萬之婦女，倘能因才施敎，使能參加近代生產，與男子共負抗戰建國之責任，則其造福國家，將不可紀極。</p>
<p>兵工人材</p>
<p>至於兵工技術人才之培養，事需專才，施行較難，應由軍事機關負責統籌，惟亦應使之能與各大學之理工課程及各生產機關發生聯繋，以備國家綏急之需也。總裁之言曰：我國抗戰根據，不在沿江沿海之淺狹交通地帶，而在廣大深長之內地，西南西北諸省，尤為我抗戰之策源地，蓋惟西南西北交通經濟之發展，始為長期抗戰與建國工作之堅實基礎。</p>
<p>結語</p>
<p>此次全國生產會議，舉行於前方將士浴血反攻殺×奏功之日，及殘暴×機威壓轟炸之下，本會同人念國難之嚴重，懷匹夫之有責，殫思竭慮，日夕商討，冀能於西南西北交通經濟之發展，貢其棉薄而抑副總裁　國之宏猷，兼慰政府殷切之期望。此偉大歷史的使命之實現，與艱鉅責任之負何，實有賴全國上下共同一致之努力，本會同人，更當竭其心力，敬謹追隨於國人之後而努力焉。所望朝野上下，悉心盡力，計劃務求其切實，經費務求其節省事業務本其必成，苦幹實幹，以達於成功，國勢之凌夷，於今百年，多難興判，古有明訓，繼往開來，責在吾人，以往兩年之抗戰，旣使吾人於艱苦奮鬥之歷程中，獲得無限寳貴之經驗與教訓，更使吾人深切自信，我炎　神明之苗裔，必能刈夷大難，而吃然自立於今日之世界，以發揚我舊邦新命之國光。今後之經濟建設，更必能證明吾中華民族創造力量之偉大，能於舉國抗戰之中，以其餘力完成中國之產業革命，確立新中國生產事業之基礎，及實現中央一面抗戰一面建國之國策。竊願國人共勉之焉。此次大會，本黨　我及國府主席，於一日萬幾軍事旁午之中，昭示訓詞，行政院　院長又點不辭勞瘁，　臨主持，諄諄　示，國人等感中　當局善　從長之至意，與殷切圖治之深心，議　發　宜言之際，敬謹表示擁護與感。（完）</p>
<h3>來自游擊區的廿個俘虜</h3>
<p>— 范世勤</p>
<p>【樊城航訊】在四個月以前，大家的心中大別山脈的游擊區，像是一個孩子失了母親，落在　　襄一樣。可是事實不然，它送了信來，說它已經從荊棘叢中長大了；它派了人來稅，它已經把　　趕出大門外了。最近，它恐怕我們不相信，它送來廿個日本弟兄來作證。</p>
<p>當我問一位憲兵的官長，將那廿個日本弟兄放在什麼地方的時候，他指着在廣場上操體操的一羣穿着土布衣服的人說：「那些就是！」我很驚奇，因為我剛從他們身邊過來，我還以為他們是些受訓的壯丁。</p>
<p>「日本弟兄們，這次你們從大別山脈裏到這裏，定了一千多里的路，可辛苦了你們。」</p>
<p>「那裏！」一個眼珠圓溜溜的日本弟兄劈頭這樣回答：「眞是想不到，我們到一個地方，這個地方的中國老百姓，送香烟送手巾給我們，而且還開會歡迎，開會歡送。今天我們到此，老百姓又送鞋送襪子來，還請我們洗了澡，我們眞又感激！又慚愧！」</p>
<p>路透社記者史密斯先生和我們同在。他說，中國老百姓眞寬大，眞愛和平。</p>
<p>我一憫一個地問着他們</p>
<p>一個矮壯的日本弟兄回答我說：「我是運瑜艦上的船員，因為被派到安慶的岸上去搶東西，給當地的游擊隊捉住了。」</p>
<p>一個有着黑　　的叫做森川囘答我說：「我是貧窮的農民，被迫來作戰，我天天夢想着家。」</p>
<p>兩個站在一起的日本弟兄對我說：</p>
<p>「合肥的游擊隊打到合肥飛機場，我們是飛行員，被他們捉住了。」</p>
<p>「日本國民的生活，在不打仗時已經活不了，現在更不用說。」</p>
<p>「日本国民反軍閥的思潮，一天一天在高漲」</p>
<p>這是他們異口同聲地對我說的。</p>
<p>有個叫做窪田益的智識分子，他分析日本說：「農民——疲憊；工人——在榨取下；智識分子——借國家為名；軍人——少壯派急進；政黨——軍關的尾巴；行政——增稅；外交——古來就軟弱」</p>
<p>還有一個穿著橡皮靴的佐籐周太郎說：「在我去年六月出國時，日本社會　不景氣，我知道我的朋友十二個人，因為反戰被關了起來。日本勞農沒有一個願意戰爭，聽說現在東京戒備甚嚴，防止反戰運動。」</p>
<p>「日本究竟出了多少兵，征兵已經到了第幾次？」我問一位在運輸艦服務的船員。</p>
<p>「去年十月以前，」他囘答：「已經出了將近二百萬人，征兵到了卅次，可是現在不知道。」</p>
<p>我們談到日本為什麼要侵略中國，一個呌做板木的說：「在國內，我聽說中國在西安事變後，中國國共兩黨聯合起來，日本為要阻止「赤化」，同時為要阻止英國在遠東勢力膨脹，所以發起這个戰争。」</p>
<p>「現在你可明白這個戰爭的眞意義嗎？」我反問。</p>

<p>【美聯社倫敦十九日電】外次巴特勒今日在下院演說、對於英、蘇談判發生阻礙之說、予以間接之證實、渠謂、蘇聯最近致英之提案、說明蘇聯計劃之優點、但英政府答稱、在現時之環境下、英國之提案較為　合、巴特勒氏繼謂、「吾人之計劃較為簡單、各國需要援助時、吾人卽能予以援助、并能維持各有關國家間之融治合作」云、</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>關於人材登記</h3>
<p>本港各報這幾天刊登着一幅引人注目的廣告</p>
<p>華人人材登記開始！</p>
<p>華人登記請從速報名！</p>
<p>衛地方卽擭衛自已！</p>
<p>今天報上、另有一則新聞、則是說：——</p>
<p>救濟廣州失業機工！</p>
<p>中央派員來港調查擬予錄用！</p>
<p>港三百餘機工參加人才登記！</p>
<p>看到從這一廣告和這一新聞，覺得有許多話應該和讀者諸君一談：本港政府於英人人材登記之後，繼續舉辦華人人材自動登記，完全因為　於時局的嚴重，急需動員人材護衛地方，其用意至為純正確當。我居留本港同胞，頗多會經參加第一次大戰的，當時對於協約國方面出力不少，那次戰爭雖然不應該參加，而華人之英勇正義，則為舉世所共欽。目前大戰危機又迫，我們自當嚴正認淸未來戰爭的意義，為維擭和平與正義而堅决反對法西斯侵略者，友邦英國近來巳在勞力于反侵略運動，我們對於本港政府這種號召，更應予以熱烈的讚助，發揚華僑過去偉大的精神，準備為保衛地方保護和平與人類文化之進步而奮鬥。我們要當同時注意的，卽是在人材登記後的擢用與待遇，能與英人完全平等而已。</p>
<p>其次，關於中央派員來港調查失業機工，我們覺得更應予以注意，第一，因為目前我國抗戰，進入一個新的嚴重階段，在在需要人材，去協力克服困難，爭取勝利，其所望於僑胞者尤為迫切。第二，抗戰以來，國內各項人材之　遭犧牲，固不待說，而流亡各地以至海外者，尤是急待救濟，目前中央能注意及此，眞是極大好事，我各界蘿僑，尤應極力擁護興協助其進行。不通我們同時還要注意者，目前祖國所需要的人材，至為廣泛，不僅迫急需要各項有助於生產建設事業的技術人才，並且還迫切需要關於軍事，政治，文化，外交各方面的專門人材；而目前流落國外的同胞中，亦不乏此種人材，因此我們希望趕快舉辦一種範國較廣計劃較詳的人材登記，經過適當的試驗，組織及訓練，分別擢引到各部門去工作。這事就不能僅賴中央政府，而有盼於各界華僑團體及社會熱心領袖，出而協力。</p>
<p>時危勢迫，願我各界僑胞，一致勉　！</p>

<p>（本報特訊）好的電影是文化的先鋒，壞的電彩，是破壞文化的先鋒。蔣百里先生在軍事上有幾句名言：「生活條件與戰鬥條件相合則勝，相離則敗，相反則亡。」從抗戰以來，華南電影界有多少工作是和抗戰相配合的，有多少工作是和抗戰相離的甚至相反的，這是不難估計的；而×人之圖我，則是無微不至，二步不肯鬆，他們向上海影界的進攻巳經有些幕後活動是敗露了。最近他們在華南又大奔走，多想從這一弱點上進攻，聽說某戲院正有被收買的可能，而某公司出品的民間故事片，也正在希圖向淪陷區大量的供應，假如我們的工作是與抗戰條件相離了，相反了，也許還未嘗不可補救，假如我們的工作更和×人的侵略步驟相配合了，那罪惡將是不可赦的，那嚴重的後果，將是不可　的。希望華南電影業嚴防×人陰謀，不要為利所誘，賺那出賣民族利益的血錢，使現者所痛，仇者所快—為了祖國千萬人犧牲頭戲，千萬人流離失所，千萬人奔走呼號出綫出力所支持的抗戰，為了你自已萬世子孫的自由，我們要大聲急呼！「商人縮囘你那食得的手吧！」</p>

<h3>香港的鼠！</h3>
<p>— 俟</p>
<p>蕃殖數量、尤多於人！</p>
<p>在報館工作的時候，是在晚上辦公的、非到深夜二時以後不能休息。那時候每個人都在，煖烘烘的被窩里尋好夢了，大地沉寂如死；老鼠也就乘着這個機會出來活動，尋覓他的食料。牆壁和地板之下，簡直是它們的「寄宿舍」，沙發和一些名貴的傢私，也不過是它們的「運動場」。它們列隊而出，來來往往，東奔西跑，熟的食物偷吃不到，生的菓品也能果腹；倘然它走進你的臥室，因為找不到食糧，於是窮凶極惡，叫個不休，這些刺耳的怪聲，使熱睡的人也要給它驚醒。有時它們更運用集團的力量，推翻花瓶飮水，打落皂虹吃皂；倘然縫了一　新衣服，不好好的掛在廚里，不幸而給它們發覺成衣匠遺留的漿糊痕跡，為了要吃漿糊，你的衣服便等不到明天，就因而穿了幾個大洞了。鼠對於人完全是破壞的，所以人對於鼠也是深惡痛絕，恨不得把它們根株剷滅—但是我們在晚上工作的，雖然明看見它們橫行，却是因為工夫最緊張的時候，不暇向它們討伐了。</p>
<p>鼠不但擾我們的好夢，毀我們的器物，更是傳染病的媒介，「鼠疫」就是多謝它們帶給人類的一種傳染病，流行的「黑死病」，也就是鼠體上的蚤所傳染的，患者發熱，身體內生了核，死後體作黑斑，醫生也常常因之束手。</p>
<p>鼠雖然在每個地方都有，不是香港的特有產品，但是香港的鼠却似乎特別的多。原來鼠的生殖力很大，小鼠百日以後，卽能產子，一年之中，共有四產，每產的五頭至十頭，這樣伸算下去，數目至為驚人；大概香港因為滅鼠的工作做得不够，所以它們能不斷的生產繁殖下去。據潔凈局的統計，從一九三〇年至一九三八年上的八年中，在香港和九龍兩地一共殺滅了一百五十萬老鼠，平均每年約有二十萬頭。滅鼠的成續這就算好嗎，但據專家的估計，每對鼠在十二個月中，可產小鼠一千二百頭，目前香港的人口雖突然增加起來，但相信鼠的數目要比人的數目多兩倍至三倍，這是多麼驚人啊—至於香港的財物因為鼠的「肆虐」而遭受的損失，他們也曾加以統計，據說每年的達二百萬元，說來幾乎令人不相信。</p>
<p>香港因為鼠而傳播的疫症，也曾鬧得很萬害，一八九四年的大疫，就是鼠的賜予。聞那次大疫最先發生於雲南，權而傳到香港，再由香港傳到印度和遠東各地。這次疫症的死亡率，廣州十萬人，香港五千人，印度逾一千萬人，從一九三〇年到現在，鼠疫在香港已經很少發現了。</p>
<p>養貓雖然可以捕鼠，但是我們對付貓也是感到相當的困難；用　籠捕鼠事實上很難成功，偶然的成功也不過是僥倖之置了。在美國，法國，俄國，英國都有「殺鼠公司」的創設，這種公司專為人家捕鼠殺鼠，解除災疫的。在香港還沒有這種設備，到現在依然大部靠貓滅鼠。提起滅鼠，香港有一件笑話，據說有一次香港政府因為鼠太橫行了，為殺滅鼠類。便頒布一條獎例：凡是殺鼠一頭的。政府以五仙的代價向他購買死鼠的屍體。這個獎例果然很收効，每天拿死鼠去兌錢的非當踴躍，源源不絕，成績甚有可觀。到後來，竟發現許多是從廣州和澳門運來的，原來他們正利用這條獎例贃錢。香港政府因此也停止收買了。</p>
<p>殺鼠最有效的辦法是用毒物殺鼠劑，最新式的殺鼠劑是「臘丁」。方法用「臘丁」射入麵包，米麥，木質，布料之中，放在老鼠必經之處，任鼠偷食，等鼠到將毒汁食物吃下時，毒性發作，鼠的全身立時强熱，就此嗚呼身死，可惜現在香港還沒有人用這方法呢！</p>

<h3>歐陽予倩論</h3>
<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>謹向努力劇運三十年的鬥士致敬</p>
<p>百齡人瑞馬相伯先生的　典過了沒多久，香港戲劇界同人又舉行歐陽予倩先生五十歲壽辰的會集。對於這位戲劇巨人，為了他三十年來的努力，使中國話劇史有着繼續不斷的新員，我們，戲劇工作者的我們，應致無限的敬意。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們需要知道他的生活與思想，足有這樣，我們才能了解他工作的過程，了解他作品的特質，由他的生涯中，我們會發現中國劇運幾個時期的基調。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生生於民國紀元前二十二年（卽光緒十五年已丑）。家鄉是湖南瀏陽，祖父是有名學者，譚嗣同唐才常先生皆出其門下，予倩生先十五歲赴日本留學，民國紀元前五年（丙午）返國，和劉韻秋女士結婚。婚後再赴日本，初學政治，後轉攻文藝。至辛亥年返國。在日本和返國以後的戲劇生活，歐陽氏有他的「自我演戲以來」一書中，有「春柳裏的開場」，「申酉會」，「同志會」，「社會敎育團」，「文社」，「春柳劇場」，「作職業悱優的時期，」「在南通住了三年」，「國民劇場的經過」，「廣東戲劇研究所之經過情形」十章述說得很詳細詳細。是從民國十六年在南京，和民十八以後在廣東，工作的收穫圾豐富。民國十九年底到上海辦「大時代社」，一二八後出國。在法國和蘇聯停留最久，參觀各劇場劇團，和飽讀各國戲劇名著。民廿二年返國，一度往福建，後再赴日本，返國歷在新華公司明星公司，聯華公司任編劇主任兼導演。七·七以後，參加上海文救。對演劇隊及組織舊戰演員，參加統一戰線工作，不遺餘力，其後才經過香港赴廣西，為國防藝術社及二一劇社導演。民廿七夏，到香港，直到現在。</p>
<p>從這三十年的戲劇活動　起來，我們可以斷定對於舊社會或壓迫者，他永遠是一個叛徒，他的工作向來未曾停止，也從不停留於一個階段。他是一個有多方面才能的藝人，最後但决不是最不重要的是：他求　在學習着，他永遠在工作着，他永遠在敎育着。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>由　所　作的劇本及影劇中，我們可以曼现　　人對於大踏步前進着的中　　　，是怎样　　握着和吸收着，怎　　　　　　參加創　　。下面是　一不甚備的目綠：</p>
<p>話劇</p>
<p>潑婦？（獨幕劇，民國十三年）</p>
<p>囘家以後（獨幕劇，民國十三年）</p>
<p>以上兩劇是屬於上海戲劇協社時代的。</p>
<p>潘金運（多幕，民國十六年）</p>
<p>車夫之家（獨幕，民國十八年）</p>
<p>屏風後（獨幕，民國十八年）</p>
<p>小英姑娘（兩慕劇，民國十八年）</p>
<p>買賣（獨幕劇，民國十八年）</p>
<p>國粹（獨幕劇，民國十八年）</p>
<p>白姑娘（兩幕劇，民國十九年）</p>
<p>以上屬於廣東戰劇研究所時代</p>
<p>不要忘了（多幕，民國廿一年）</p>
<p>同住的三家人（獨幕，民國廿一年）</p>
<p>曙光（獨幕，民國廿六年）</p>
<p>靑紗帳裏（多幕，民國廿六年）</p>
<p>翻譯話劇</p>
<p>玩偶家庭（易卜生：Nora）</p>
<p>空與色（谷崎潤一郎）</p>
<p>賊（前田河廣一郎）</p>
<p>兒童世界（蘇聯兒童劇）</p>
<p>慾魔（卽黑暗之勢力）</p>
<p>歌劇</p>
<p>尤三姐（民國三年）</p>
<p>實蟾送酒（民國七年）</p>
<p>人面桃花（民國七年）</p>
<p>臥薪嘗胆（民國八年）</p>
<p>是恩是愛（描寫石達開的末路民國九年）</p>
<p>荊軻（民國　十六年）</p>
<p>潘金蓮（民國十六年）</p>
<p>楊貴妃（民國十八年）</p>
<p>劉三妹（民國十八年）</p>
<p>嫵夫恨（民國廿四年）</p>
<p>桃花扇（民國廿六年）</p>
<p>梁紅玉（民國廿六年）</p>
<p>影劇</p>
<p>王潔冰淸（民國十五年）</p>
<p>三年以後（民國十五年）</p>
<p>挑花扇（民國廿四年）</p>
<p>小玲子（民國廿五年）</p>
<p>淸明時節（與姚葦農合編　民國廿五年）</p>
<p>如此繁華（民國廿六年）</p>
<p>木蘭從車（民國廿七年）</p>
<p>在這些劇本中，都沒有了不得的說敎，也沒有驚人的情節。他所有的是近情近理的情節，隨時隨地的現實，適於大衆的形象的發展，和天衣無縫，銳利諷刺的對白，特別充溢在字裏行間成文字以外的是反抗性和正義感。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>予俯先生受革命的洗禮最早，在日本時，同盟會正是活　的時期。民國成立後，軍閥的强烈的壓迫，也直接影響到他。十六年到廿四年的時候，他一直感受到國內政治的不統一和侵略者所賜予的痛苦。所以根本上他是一個具有正確世界觀的統一戰綫的擁護者。</p>
<p>在戲劇電影方面，從民國十八年起，他提倡着，「適時代為民衆的戲劇」這一口號，在抗戰劇運展開中，他是主張「戲劇應該實踐中國化，大衆化」上主張「提高藝術水凖」，主張「戲劇工作者不要　了　情而忘記了戲劇聯術需要修養。」</p>
<p>自然，這些是對抗戰劇運理論興實踐的提示與補充，而不是某一理論　　的全郎。」</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>予倩先生可以說是多才的藝人，幾乎是全能的戲劇工作者。他懂哲學，懂，政治，長於詩詞，了解音樂，他可以編劇。導演，表演，設計舞台裝置，他會英語日語，對法國蘇聯文字亦有若干根底。在一個中國人中，確是不可多得的巨人。</p>
<p>他主要地是一個好導演，其次是一個編劇家，再其次是一個不喜歡出聲的理論家；他是一個不大成功的管理者與組織者，是一個很不行的政客——他不會宣傳，不會標榜，不能手疾眼快地應付事情，太不善變。</p>
<p>這是他有成就的原因　但同時也是他的工作不能充分實現効能，得到一致了解的原故。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>在今日，戲劇工作者所要跟歐陽先生學習的，是數十年如一日不斷學習，不斷工作，不斷救育的精神。和他「富貴不能淫，威武不能屈」的反抗奮鬥的勇氣，學他那深入淺出的大衆化，中國化的多樣的劇作方式，和不爭名不奪利的服務態度。</p>
<p>同時，也有許多地方是要靑年工作者用突擊精神建造新紀錄，以補充和老大歐陽先生的工作，使抗戰劇運得到更高度的發展的，那就是：</p>
<p>（一）加强抗戰必勝，建國必成的信念，使戲劇眞能動員大衆，加運民族解放勝利之獲得；</p>
<p>（二）建立鋼鐵的靑年戲劇幹部，集體地學習與工作，充實並擴大全國劇界的統一戰線；</p>
<p>（三）　行劇本創作運動，要內容和形式有機地統一，要雄渾有力，代表新生的中國；</p>
<p>（四）提高演技及舞台技術水準；實踐戲劇領域之擴展；</p>
<p>（五）工作能力，工作路綫，工作方式，工作態度之有機地一致的發展。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生還沒有老，他在工作與學習中都充溢着靑春與活力，這篇文不是淸算而是更大的行動的引子。我們可以預言—到予倩先生和馬相伯先生一樣大的時候，我們將有更豐富的檢閱！</p>
<p>寫於歐陽先生五十壽辰之日</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生近影</p>
<h3>中救招待會特寫</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>馳聘南北戰場二十個月、為千千萬萬軍民所愛護的中國救亡劇團，抵港已經一個多月了。時間在工作者的眼前溜過。更像閃電一般的匆急。五十多天來，由於中救朋友們的「堅苦」與「熱情」所感召，有如洪流一般，到處就掀起「歡迎」，「聯歡」，演講，「座談」，「贈旗」的高潮。中救的朋友們，為誠懇的答謝各界的盛情。并為交換工作意見，特於昨天，假座思豪酒店舉行了一次盛大的集會。</p>
<p>天一直下着雨，但是雨，阻不住他們的會見。亦就是因為雨，越是顯示出眞誠的感應，匯成了熱的交流。本港各界領袖與各社團機關代表接三連四地跑進來，身子一搖，衣服上的雨水直向地板上洒着，雨衣，雨傘，慢慢集中起來，男裝，女裝，華貴的，樸素的，樣樣式式，應有盡有，怪有趣的一個「雨具展覽會」。見面寒暄，劈頭先說「等雨」，「避雨」，「冒雨」的三部曲。中救朋友應接不暇，頻頻說着「勞駕！勞駕！」「對不起！對不起！」三五成組，教佈在巨大的禮堂，暢所欲言。</p>
<p>時間的指針到了四時，前面一橫行，中間二豎行，一百多人，很整齊地圍坐起來。</p>
<p>在一陣熱烈的掌聲中，「中救」的團長金山先生站了起來，首先他代表「中救」，向今天冒雨參加的來賓，致誠摯的謝意，然後說到二十个月來，他們在戰地工作的過程。他說：「廿個月來，在戰地，同英勇的將士，純僕的同胞，密切的生活一起，抱定學習的態度來工作，到現在，我可以說，我們對於戰爭中的祖國，是了解的，我們認認了祖國，深深知道祖國前途的光明，是在歷史上找不出例證來的。」</p>
<p>「但是，居留在海外的僑胞，為了地域的特殊，我相信有一部份僑胞對於祖國的認識是不免模糊的，尤其在武漢失守以後的抗戰現階段，尤其在×寇漢奸大肆造謠，破壞，誣　的今天，敝團這次出國的任務，便是針對着這幾點，去向僑胞宣傳，使他們更進一步的參加抗戰建國的偉業，使僑胞了解戰勝的祖國，是會把他們在海外困苦的地位改變過來的，是不會抹煞每一個國民在緊難困苦的鬥爭中的功續的。</p>
<p>「同時根据我們在戰地的工作經騐，傷兵的醫藥，收容，運輸問題，戰地文化食糧問題，殘廢軍人，出征軍人家屬，陣亡將士家屬的生計問題，使我們感到都有盡最大的可能去解决的必要，敝團這次出國的另一任務，便是為建立傷兵收容站傷兵醫院等募集五十萬捐款，抗戰以來，僑胞輸材輸力的踴躍情形，是每個同胞都知道的。他們寄給祖國的千百萬損欵是建國的基石，抗戰的力量，我相信熱愛祖國的僑胞是會帮助我們來完成這一工作。</p>
<p>「但是，這一任務是太重了，我們自已是太不夠了，不久，我們就要挑負起這個重大的担子離開香港。在離開此地以前，熱切的盼望各位先生各位朋友給我們以多方面的指敎，各位一分寶貴的意見，可以减少我們十分工作的困難，為了想多得到一些指敎，我不願把我的話拖得太長，同時也免得過多的躭誤了諸位寳貴的時間」。</p>
<p>熱情，誠懇，金山先生不但是一個嚴肅的救亡工作者，同時亦是一個富有感動力的演說家。這是時代訓練出來的優秀人材。大家很與奮地一面吃茶點，一面聽演講：</p>
<p>來賓演講第一位是中央委員吳鐵城代表宋大章先生，對於中救慰勉有嘉。記者公會代表李建豐說中救從服務前線到海外宣慰僑胞，是文化界的光榮。表現我們靑年不頹唐，不萎靡，亦是中華民族的光榮。次說他承各界賑聯會之托，協辦此次中救的義演，為藝術，為意義，是値得大家踴躍欣賞的。</p>
<p>張兆棠先生說：戲劇就是宣傳的最好工具。從前的戲劇，演岳飛的，備受歡迎，演秦檜的，給觀衆恨着，罵着，打着，可知戲劇的力量之偉大。現在的戲劇比從前又進步得多了，收效亦更深刻了。</p>
<p>戲劇界先進歐陽予倩先生說；中敎抵港，各界熱烈地歡迎着，到海外去的使命很重大，亦必受廣大倚胞迎。中救初成立，歐陽先生也在上海，他現在還記得一他當時歡送的情形，我們聽了，亦深深感動。他說，現在見了金山，如見久別的朋友，非常興奮，非常高興。中救的工作是多力面的，戲劇僅僅是重要的工具而已。他們的進步，是從火綫上　鍊出來的，這亦是中國戲劇的新發展，在鄒市的戲劇界實在覺得十分慚愧！</p>
<p>現在，抗戰是艱苦，將來在瘡痍滿目中建國亦是困難，中救此行任務為抗戰，亦為建國。我們大家亦負有同樣重要的任務，歡迎中敎，要以工作上相見面。</p>
<p>——這一席括，給歐陽先生說來特別親切而有意義，一陣熱烈的掌聲織動起來。</p>
<p>還有好幾位來賓演講後，隨中救出國之廣西學生軍團長林樞先生殿後報告地在前綫參加抗戰的經過，全場空氣特別緊張起來，他說在大炮，飛機炸彈之下如何作戰，以及士氣之旺盛，靑年，民衆的偉大力量，活生生的英勇事蹟，使人聽了非常奮。林先生圾後一段話尤其使人感動的：「金山先生說我帮忙中救宣傳，非常難得，其實，我跟中救胄年朋友學習，才是非常難得。金山導演的時候滿身大，使我非常感動，現在汗，我不會演劇亦担任了一個小角色來，我希望將來會演得更進步給大家參觀。」熱烈的掌聲拉得很多，大家笑送下著林生先。來</p>
<p>最未金山先生作總結束：「我們是大家派出的哨兵，我們經驗駐中了解抗戰一定是勝利的。我們自已覺得修養很不够，但是有二個宇我們一定做得到的，就是「誠懇」。我們流盡最後一滴血亦决不退回來，希望諸位給我們哨兵以命令，與鞭策。我們一定要以工作來報答諸位的祈望。現在謹代表中國救亡劇團全體團員，向諸位敬禮。再見」！</p>
<h3>「黃花崗」重演的意義</h3>
<p>— 膺鍾</p>
<p>中國的新興戲劇運動，因為全面抗戰的展開更加顯示了它的尖銳性和鬥爭性。香港的戲劇工作者，也應環境的需要，發揮了戲劇藝術的宣傳效果，領導着大衆參加到抗戰的行列中去。</p>
<p>「黃花崗」這幕偉大歷史革命劇，就在這種意養下公演了，這是香港戲劇運動史上少有的偉大行動，它的力量和反響的宏大自是無可比擬的，尤其在以鞏固與發展香港的劇運工作下，他盡了很大的促進任務。現在，它又在香港各界賑聯會主辦下再度的公演了，這次公演負起了兩點重大的作用：除了和第一次公演時一樣地為籌欵撫　前線陣亡將士的家屬，更為着慶祝我們戲劇工作者最先進的導師歐陽予倚先生的五十壽辰。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生在中國新興戲劇運動他建立了不少的功績，他開闢了舊戲改良的生路，他領導了新興戲劇運動，從幾十年前直到現在，他始終都是牢牢地站在戲劇的崗位上。</p>
<p>凡十年來中國戲劇運動的建立期內，為了環境的阻撓，困難不知有多少戲劇工作者離開了自已的崗位，放棄了這偉大的工作，但是我們的歐陽予倩先生，還是那樣數十年如一日的在艱難中苦鬥着！</p>
<p>抗戰的現階段，戲劇固然發揮了他的很大的效能，但是，却有不少的戲劇工作者，抹煞了戲劇在藝術上應有的深入的工作，而只拾起了他宣傳的一面，其實，戲劇藝術的精，是會帮助他的宣傳作用的，扶煞了這一點，往往不免流入庸俗，自然，我們不能在這樣緊迫的時候，要求每個戲劇工作者都兩面顧到，但是，這艱鉅的工作却必須有人肩負起來，而歐陽予倩先生，直到現在都是在衆領導着我們，領導着大走向那一條充滿了光芒，的路上去。</p>
<p>我的戲劇工作者，以最大的熱誠，來祝福歐陽予倩先先生的五十壽辰？是寄與了無限重大的深意和作用的。</p>
<h3>祝歐陽先生永遠青百！</h3>

<p>歐陽予倩先生是什慶樣的一個人？為什麼値得我們戲劇工作者來慶祝？自然，我相信我們戲劇工作者都已經淸楚知道——歐陽予倩先生是我們中國的新興戲劇之拓荒者—他在三十年前把這新興戲劇　術傳播到祖國的軍野，同時，在這三十年悠長的歲月裏，他壓　千辛萬苦，以暴風雨中的海燕底姿態出現，不屈不撓地培植，灌漑……始終沒有離開過他的崗位，始終沒有放秦過新興戲劇傳統的革命任務；可以說：歐陽予倩先生的戲劇工作史，就是中國新興戲劇運動史中重要的一個篇章，歐陽予倩先生戲劇工作的光榮紀錄，也就是中國今日戲劇所開放的花朶的主要滋養；這一切，一切，已經足够我們戲劇工作者熱烈慶祝的了！</p>
<p>在這原則上値得我們熱烈慶祝之外。我以為：在歐陽予倩先生不斷的學習，不斷的工作，時時刻刻站在大時代的前面，勇敢戰鬥，這種精神，正是戲劇工作者的樓範，就是我們値得學習的。發揚的。</p>
<p>同時，在今天。民族自衛抗戰在達到了一個更嚴重的階段，一些對國家民族沒有堅决信念的動搖份子，都先後現形，叛離祖國投到×人的隙營裏去了，或者離開自已的崗位而停止了戰鬥，而歐陽先生在行動上答覆我們，他貢献了全部的力量，服役抗戰。『歲寒知松柏』，「烈風知勁草」，中華民挨到這危難的時機的現在，以五十高齡的默陽先生，仍然效忠如一，挽救民族危亡。我們來慶祝這樣一个鬥士的壽辰，决不是沒意義的。</p>
<p>最後我慶祝：歐陽先生的工作精神永遠靑春！</p>

<h3>大地影業公司第一部影片「孤島天堂」的紹介</h3>
<p>— 青雲</p>
<p>蔡楚生南來後導演的第一部新作品</p>
<p>在祖國突發的抗戰進入長期戰爭狀態以後，在上海和香港相繼形成孤島以後，那不及應付突然襲擊而僵死了的上海電影業是借屍還魂了，同時，香港影業也如醉如狂地顯着異樣的蓬勃起來。這種畸形現象，使整個影壇為之陷入動蕩不安的狀態。所幸還有少數工作者不曾為威所脅，為利所誘，在惡劣環境中堅守着他們的電影崗位，由於實際行為的證明，我們的前進的導演蔡楚生先生，該說是守住崗位的一個：這種不放棄責任的工作者，我們與其尊之為勇敢的鬥士，毋寧說他是「艱苦的小兵」。</p>
<p>在某種導演可以出產三四十片的時間裏，他還是在經營「南海風雲」的劇本——搜集，選擇，處理他的劇本材料，他抱定了一個主意。——寧可它不實現，决不讓它馬虎的實現，而約請蔡楚生先生導演，這部片子的大地影業公司也正抱着同標的宗旨。</p>
<p>因為需要等候天時來拍「南海風霎」，所以在幾個月以前，他决定先拍趙英方君原著之「孤島天堂」這一個新戲，經過兩三個月的埋頭工作，他完成了分幕劇本，籌備好了一切，于是「孤島天堂」開始了攝影場上的工作，連日以來，通宵，通宵，通宵，正在緊漲的攝製中，每一個參與工作的人，都用足了他們的力量。</p>
<p>這部戲雖然叫做「孤島天堂」但它是剝去了「孤島」所披看天堂的外衣，透視着孤島的內層，從這裏剖析經過「抗戰」—這塊大試金石所試過的一羣人物，從這一羣人物中，見到抗戰的縮影，表現出它絕對的意義。</p>
<p>它所包括的人物有北方舞女，神秘靑年，內地小姐，洋場闊少，破打啞針的　吧，被炮火嚇壞的　子，流氓爪牙，苦命婦人，賣報的孩子羣，……飾演這些角色的人，是遠這而來的黎莉莉，洪虹，寧做餓莩而不拍毒素電影的李淸，久違了的白璐，蔣君超，和中華藝術劇團的諸位演員，如童　，楊薇，葛鑫，姜明，李化，李景波，藍馬，張立德……諸位，在銀幕上在舞台上，各地觀衆對於他們是早有非常淸楚的認識了。</p>
<p>因為電影不特是綜合的藝術，更是綜合的科學技術——聲光電化，都是造成一部電影圾精妙的部份，所以技術的好壞，常常决定了一部影片藝術價値的美惡。大地公司雖然是在艱難困苦中拓荒草創起來，但對於這一點，則是一絲一毫都不肯苟且的，記者會經參觀「孤島天堂」部份的試片，在技術上可說是有着飛速的進步，可與舶來的影片相媲美。其次我們看到大地公司技術上的設備，覺得他們是應該得到這種優異成績的。他們所用的攝影機是「拜而好」最新式專拍聲片備有五個鏡頭的機器，錄音機係羅靜予設計製造國內唯一之靜音式錄音機，其他如配音，洗印，燈光，剪接都是華南影界所僅有的。</p>
<p>大地公司技術部也是由該公司主持人羅靜予先生親自負責，羅氏在抗戰後對電影技術上的貢献很多，是不必多所介紹的。至於劇務和事務方面繁重的責任則由譚友六先生主持，此外由名攝影師吳蔚霎先生担任攝影，經驗暨富的葉堅先生擔任佈景，從這一個理想的工作人陣線上，可以斷定它必會成為一部理想的作品。</p>
<p>從來對於作品絕不馬虎是蔡楚生先生成功的特點之一，應該給觀衆看而觀衆又需要看的部份他越發會不憚煩難的表現出來，絕不會濫用電影手法，來避免困難。在劇本裏，他巳經把戲的細部想的非常週到，寫的非常詳細，而在每場戲攝製之前更用圍表來計劃每個演員的地位，這種工作，也是南中國導演所不會做過的。惟有　苦的奮鬥，才有卓絕的表現，在「都會的早晨」「漁光曲」「新女性」「迷途的羔羊」「王老五」之後，我　將能看到怎樣的一部「孤島天堂」這是不難的預測。</p>
<p>中立者為孤島天堂導演蔡楚生　左右為主角李清及黎莉利</p>

<h3>足球義賽因雨取銷　今天南華戰水兵　下午五時一刻在加山舉行</h3>
<p>（本報事訊）已近黃梅時節、雨水正多、而現在尙施、下午三時半鐘聲對海光、行限制食　的香港、雨正是居民的甘露，不過、每逢星期四時半大中對太古、五時半六及星期日、乃球人活躍的好日子、一般及時行樂的迷民春草對康元、以各隊實力論、誰也不願意在這兩天內因雨　興、事負良辰、卽如昨天、鐘聲聯絡得宜、海光當非球壇原有兩個好秩序、（一）是南華對聯隊的足球義賽、其敵、太古比大中咯强、有（二）是中華對友碑的棒球聯賽、若然演出、必哄動一時取勝可能、春草進守得宜、、怎知整天大雨、俱不能舉行、大煞風景、一般迷民皆怨當可擊敗康元、又今日一律老天不行方便、</p>
<p>那幕足球義賽、旣因雨誤佳期、恐不能繼續舉行了、因為聯隊的球人、乃由幾會方面負責選出的、昨天旣賽不成、總會便不能卽速通知各球人、改於今日作戰、而且陸軍的球人、向在星期日甚少作足球之戲、故卽使總會能够卽速分別通知、亦未必可以成軍、出與南華週旋、所以、總會負責人昨已通知南華、這幕義賽在今天將不能舉行的、而南華又出發南遊在卽、再無適合的日期、可與聯隊會師、且待將來班師囘港、然後為難民請命龍、</p>
<p>然而、南華曾約定英艦干和路號的水兵、于今天下午五時一刻、在加山作練習賽、如今天放晴、則這幕戰爭、必依時畢行、聽說這隊水兵、不乏能員、實力很强、故南華亦編一完善的陣綫應戰、</p>

<h3>初學游泳者（一）　幾種常見的錯誤</h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>游泳是一種全身運動、並且是人生絕不可缺少的保身技術、在四時皆宜的南國　、格外是一種至高無上的運動。不過初學的人、往往自己有了錯誤而不自知、而這種錯誤的結果、小則可以影響游泳的技術、大則可以危及生命、現在把常見的幾種舉出來、希望初學游泳的人注意改正、</p>
<p>（一）慌張怕水　水是天然具有『浮力』和「壓力』的、初泳的人、沒有認識水性於入水後復受着浮力的影響、覺得手不能動作、足不能舉步、身體搖搖欲倒、一切動作、不能自主、受着壓力的影響、胸部備感束轉、呼吸不能自由、氣急敗壞、岌岌可危、週身沒有是處、因此就懷疑水這探東西、不是人力可以戰勝、不期然而然的生出一種怕水的心理、慌張失措、舉止反常、水中的一切危險、就從此造成了，須知水旣有『浮力』它目然能帮助我們浮出水面、只要你熟習了水性、用鎭定的頭腦、適當的方法來利用這種『浮力』、自然可以使你獲得游泳技術上的一切要求、水是絕沒有可怕的道理、</p>
<p>（二）昂頭屈膝　初泳的人、因為水會乘呼吸時從鼻孔和口腔裏侵入肺部、為　利呼吸、避免危險、所以老是把頭部昂出水面，因為足部受着水的壓力、伸直了不易上舉、為了便利動作、所以擊水都是屈曲膝蓋、不過物件在水裏能够浮起、是看它的重量和附着於水面面積的大小為斷的、同樣大小同條輕重的物件、要是浮起的話、它附着於水面的部份、一定是最大、響如、一根木頭、它浮在水面、一定是橫着、沒有堅着的、這是一個很淺顯的例子、因此、一個人要能在水裏浮起、也必須盡量便全體在水面上的部份增大、倘是昂起頭部，屈曲膝部、那麼全身附着於水面的部份，就减少了頭部和足部的屆曲、浮起自然感覺困難了、初泳的人、越想浮起、越不能浮起的原因、就在于此、</p>

<h3>當前學生（四）　對於體格訓練應有的革新</h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>學生對於這動，大都唱着如意調，高興怎樣就怎，，不管什麼叫作姿勢，芷確不正確，更不願計及。此中原因，一則因為他們隨便成習，隨便動着，容易適合他們隨便的意意；一則因為他們偷懶成性，按正確資勢做運動，一定感吃力，希圖省力，所以不願出正確的姿勢，須知運動不按正確的姿勢，是無法獲得運動的效益的。譬如：體操中的轉體運動，功效本在腹腰，練習時雙足不可隨着轉體的方向移動旋轉，否朋，影響只及雙足。不及腹腰，這是直接影響身體的；又如田徑賽和球類等運動，不按正確姿勢，表面上雖只影響成績，但往往因為成績落後而减少興趣，不願繼續努力，結果還是影響健康。這是隨便的運動，必須革新為正確姿勞的運動者一。</p>
<p>畢生平時為了習尙所好，往往單做一種自己喜歡的運動，結果往往功效偏於局部而形成畸形的發展；專重肌肉的發達而忽略內臟的鈠練，釀成外强中乾的缺陷。須知身體的任何一部，不能得正常的發展，都可以影響健康的。我們固然不能單做甲部份的運動，而忽略了乙部分的運動；我們也不能因為運勸甲部，乙部間接有運動的機會而忽略了它直接的運動。因為間接的運動，牧效總不如直接運動來得迅速，這是局部的運動，必須革新為全身各都平均發展的運者二。</p>
<p>終日不上運動場，終年少有運動機會的學生，於體格固然不能得鍛鍊之益，成日在運動場，不管體力勝任不勝任，一味靈動　幹的學生，體格不能獲鍛練之益，也是一樣，所謂『過猶不及』是也，不過我以為太過的弊害，還勝過不及，不及的，只要加緊努力，就可達到適可的程度。太過的：輕者須要相當時問休養，才能恢復原狀，以前鍛鍊的工夫，盡付流水；重者須要長時間療治，甚或戕害其身體，終身無復原的希望。這是太過或不及的運動，必須革新為適可而止的運動者三。</p>
<p>受着教員的監視而動，人多興旺時而動，有好良環境時而動，運動合於本人心意時而動，反之卽不動的一曝十寒，或作或息的運動，任憑你一天動得怎樣動，一次動得怎樣多，結果和一天吃了多次，隔了多天再吃，一次吃了許多，下次不吃，身體上不能得營養的一樣無益，這是或作或聲的運動，必須革新為持之以恆的運動者四。</p>
<p>『登高必自卑』。『行遠必自邇』，是做事必須循序漸進的最好例證。練習運動，不但應當按各人的發育順序，體格情形循序漸進；就是每次練習中，也應當按生理的需要循序漸進。初練運動，身體未到達堅强的程度，應當先用緩和而能普遍發展的運動，打好根基，然後逐漸採用動量較大的運動來增進健康，每次運動開始時，因為體温較低，各部肌肉未有準備，應當先用舒緩的運動使身體發暖，關節曁活，然後逐步增加動量以違成運動的目的。不問一切，千篇一律的正式打球運動，是許葬運送健康的，這是越級獵等運動，必須革新為循序漸進的運動者五，</p>
<p>總之在這非常時期，國家非常分子——學生，應當具備非常體格應付非常環境，完成抗戰露國的非常事業，是盡人皆知的，不過要有非常的體格，對於體格訓練必須下非常的决心，把以前一切不正確的認識，正確過來、走錯的路徑、故換過來，才有確實　成的把握（完）</p>

<h3>祗要要演习不应膜拜</h3>
<p>— 史超</p>
<p>什聲　藝術？——藝術是向着形式創造的人　的勞働底生產物。</p>
<p>什麼　藝術家？——　術家是把周圍環境的這個或那個的要素在空間改　着位置的，合　的的人類底活動的勞慟者。</p>
<p>我從前是這樣說，現在也還是這樣說：『對任何前衛或先驅鄒紙要學習，不應膜拜』。</p>
<p>我們對藝術的前衛者是祇應當像羅馬的民衆向當時的富者這樣叫喊：『給我們麵包和美觀呵—……給我們以美麗的印象呵！而這印象又是豐富的，多樣的，明快的，他們必須是中等以上，必須在我們普通所見的東西以上』。這樣去要求和準備去學習與接受，而不應該像一般愚劣的教徒們向上帝禱求。</p>
<p>然而，跟着前衛底後一代靑年們，大部份是把這　弄錯了，他們對任何的一个前衛者都看做神聖不可侵犯的東西，他們幷不是　到前衛者底寶藏萬去學習與接受他那豐膽的財富，而祗是跪在連我們底前衛底眼看不見的遠遠的地方去膜拜與喃喃地祷求，在家裏供奉着，什麼地方也供奉着……這是多可憐的事。</p>
<p>要知道，我們的前衛從祖先的接受的財富，是必然地也同樣更或增加了地交給他那可愛的後一代的，祇要願意去學習。奧斯特洛夫斯基說；「他（前衛者）是把給己的財富毫不愛惜地，分配前我們的」。</p>
<p>當然，把前衛者當是一个沒有生命沒有靈魂的木偶而去膜拜，是不但不能把他的財富提取過來，更無可疑義地對他是一種絕大的侮辱。無論我們的前衛是如何的天才或深湛，但到底是有血有肉的，有靈魂，有優　也有缺點的人，他的理論，他的行動，他的一切，由於他經驗豐贍，修養的深刻，都會大部份是對的，不過，却不能說是全部的絕對的對，原因並沒有什麼，就是前衛者也是人——與普通人沒有兩樣的人。人與人間是祗有學習，幷沒有模拜是瞭然的了。</p>
<p>五月廿日適　是我國劇運底前衛的藝人——歐陽予倩先生的五十壽辰，全港的戲劇工作者為了要慰勞那堅决刻苦地幹了了二三十年劇運工作，在中國的貧弱的劇運史中，流了不少汗的勞働者，特演出民族史劇『　花崗』，這當然是一件很有意義的事，不過，我們慶祝的意義幷不是向歐陽先生膜拜，而是跟他習學，這點是有鄭重地提出的必要。</p>
<p>我們應當向他學習些什麼呢？</p>
<p>第一是他的勇敢；第二是他是勇敢；第三也還是他是勇敢地把中國幾千年的舊戲劇換以新的內容，更盡量地使用着新的形式，使舊戲劇能與偉大的戰鬥階段相適應，成功為抗戰建國過程中的一環有力的宣傳工具。</p>
<p>他是勇敢地把接受到的西歐的先進劇人的遺產而匯輸到中國，使中國的話劇適動有着美麗的成果。</p>
<p>他是勇敢地在中國廿年劇運中中。挺起胸脯，不折不撓的堅持到令日。</p>
<p>他從前是勇敢地刻苦地研究着，現在也仍是勇敢地刻苦地研究着，連一滴注意，一滴精神，也貫輸到中國話劇運動中。一方面他把勞動所得來的豐贍的經騐毫不愛惜地給與年靑的後一羣：另一方面他仍努力地學習着追求着。</p>
<p>他勇敢堆……</p>
<p>這些都是應當跟似學習，而相信他也會很願意亳不介懷地把全部拿供出來，祗要後一輩不把他作為偶像去膜拜，而切實地跟他學習。</p>
<h3>三重奏</h3>
<p>— 楊彥歧</p>
<p>海之幻想曲</p>
<p>海上的風像有異味的靈感。我想振翼飛去，出港口，飄在海面，數浮行船舶，歌離鄉之曲。多少人，奔赴前程；帶着各式的心。映着不同的淸影，留着異樣的心情·在港內海濱·行子遠去迢迢，白　且一程送，送別歸來，又復一陣惆悵。</p>
<p>海上的風像有異味的靈感。我想潛入水底，靜游去，探盡大洋的秘府，　覓人間乾凈土。海底的陰沉，一片碧，禁不住軍烟兵火，也染上了紅色斑點。隨了遠征人的心頭火，低歌正義韻律：數不盡的恨，說不完的情緒，跟着水泡，浮到海而，　海風吹掉。</p>
<p>老年人台髮的樂章</p>
<p>海面的波紋，映出老年人的白　銀絲。</p>
<p>每一條細柔的白髮，孕蔽了一個心底的幽靈——或者說是死去的玫瑰花吧。</p>
<p>靑年人愛山，老年愛海</p>
<p>因為靑年人會在山驚間奔放他們的情感，他們會跑，會跳，會伴着各人身外的靈魂。從這個山峯　攀另一個石嶺·太陽是他們的，給他　熱和力，尤其在烽火中，穿山越嶺，千萬年靑人合着一條心。</p>
<p>老年人會在海面上咀嚼剩餘在心靈深處的味道，月亮是屬於他們的，月亮的永生的光輝，使他冷了的心情重複墮入昔日的夢境。記得是某年的嚴冬，金戈影兒幌出的軍令，戰鼓的怒嗚，曾換得多少敵人的頭頗肝心—或者，或者是某年的五月裏，春光未老，風物逗着人笑，他會經為一個美體的少女留下過紙上文字的影兒：還有，那徵雨的簿暮，園地的迷濛春色，正撇下第一點風光，他曾緩步而行，想尋求一個天上籃色的冠冕。如今，藍的冠冕也祗是紙上的淡痕，復經時光的磨蝕了。</p>
<p>白髮裏，又顯　墓地黃昏；晚霞　過兩排白場，正是夕陽無限好，春風輕拂柳梢。老年人……樂章的餘音像一陣微風，吹在海面上，引起絲絲微波。</p>
<p>沒有詩意的故事</p>
<p>靑年人的人生，與老年人的人生，有一個不同，就是：前者是『侍候的人生』：後者是『被侍候的人生』</p>
<p>所以，海風裏永遠旋着不同的故事。</p>
<p>青年人這個，愛那個；愛女神，愛永生的美。處處把目已認作一個候人，來侍候所愛的一切——結果是在心上刻上一個人生的歷史畫，到了老年，需要侍候的時候，心上生命的歷史盡成了烟絲飄浮的所在。</p>
<p>不妨講一段戀愛故事吧（人生一切可以用戀愛喻）</p>
<p>靑年的愛，熱如火焰；到了老年，縐發覺是館了的。戀愛，應該像吸烟一樣：愉快的燃着了，愉快的吸出烟味，又愉快的擲掉。老年人的鬍子裏，流出一絲笑，笑靑年人把一件愉快的事，弄得太嚴肅了。（其實當老年人年輕時，又何嘗不如此呢？這是纏人的柔絲！）</p>
<p>戰地的金戈影兒，震起　子裏更安祥的微笑。</p>
<p>我說過，老年人愛海；所以。海面上又露着一個慈和純白的老年人的像。</p>
<h3>在丁溝</h3>
<p>— 童瘦萍</p>
<p>流動宣傳記略</p>
<p>現在第三次出發了，地點是在丁溝。</p>
<p>丁溝摩開我們　據地約三十里路，那邊從沒有人去宜　過，地方情形據說是相當的好。我們便决定去一次，在途中經過三小時，先到了丁溝市立的小學，校長聲說在城裏因公未返，由一位姓史的代表招待着，他對我們表示很歡迎，他說：</p>
<p>「在這個時候，諸位還能不遠的到我們這窮鄉僻壤的小鎭上來，眞是難得，我們也非常的感激，我們這裏的人，很多是抱了各人自掃門前雪的主張，對於國家的事，他們根本不願意多聽，更不願傍的人多說。今天諸位從遠處來，我想定能够刺激下子的，實在，我們自己的能力太單弱了……』接着是謙虛地浮出了一陣笑，我們都隨着笑了。</p>
<p>史先生領着學生都集合到操場上去。接着由秋同志演說。</p>
<p>這裏的一羣開始貼標語，又去買了紙來，臨時寫了許多。</p>
<p>操場上轟起一片掌聲，秋同志的動人演說精東了，接着史先生又作了一次充補，忽然，從遠處　來了一陣歡聲，西邊的樹林後，一列學生，正徐徐的唱着歌走來。我問了史先生，纔知道他們的分校長得訊就集合學生趕來參加，我們眞感到無上的興奮，眼望着行列走進操傷，有次序地立定了。由史先生的介紹，我們認識那分校長黃君，在『為了組國』的共同目標下，我們親熱的握手談着着。</p>
<p>漸漸地，一輪淡白色的太陽，從雲層裏看出它緊掛在西塘上的樹稍頭，鵠立着的學生，經過了史先生　吩咐，次第的排成一條長長的行列，跟在我們身後，走出校門，這樣繞　遊行了一週，那悲壯的歌聲，激昂的口號，在數百個巨細喉嚨中，激邊着全鎭，人們都給轟動了起來！</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸四下裏合壠釆，我們重進該校，開始演講。承史先生的熱心，着實給予很大的助力：在校外的廣場上，特別替我們搭好一座檯，天快黑了，掛上一架汽油燈　光亮得好似白天一樣。四下裏的人，都從黑暗中奔集到這光明的場合來，立定了脚跟，伸着頸項向臺上望着，望着我們在光明的燈下演出：『東北同胞一，『糊塗蛋』。</p>
<p>觀衆越聚多了，在臺上的我們。可以見到站近的人面部表情，在隨着劇情而嗔而喜，好些人還在　在為。一般于思于思的老公公，念經拜佛的老婆婆，還有一些公子哥兒般的少年——更很有興趣的立在羣衆中凝神注視着。</p>
<p>夜風襲上廣塲，氣溫更低了，然而我們並不覺得冷，觀衆更不覺得冷，我們抵禦着，到完成我們的工作，總下　穿起厚的服裝，最後，人才漸漸的移動，散開，留下了一個寂寞的廣場。</p>
<p>史先生早給我們預備下住處，在一個校　裏十幾隻課桌拚成了一隻巨床。中二個靑年，　在八九條棉被中，度過了一個嚴冬之夜。</p>
<h3>幻</h3>
<p>— 電長</p>
<p>曾有過美麗而縹渺的幽夢，在過度神經疲乏之後，心底疊起一申，它濃似酒。然而淡如水，正是將褪盡顏色的時候。</p>
<p>我……我髣髴矗立在高山之巔，岌岌然，巍巍然，黃霞摩掣我之頂，儼然如冠，白雲冉冉按撫我之背，更　傲地抬首，仰天，胸樣淫浸着郁濃的雨露俯視足下萬千：那蜿蜓曲折的長流，那蓊鬱莽蒼的田野，那方形伏踞的城廓，那鱗次櫛比的人家，那隆突起伏的山早，那水明如鏡的湖沼，偶有幾處烟霞輕鎖，濛濛淇溟，游絲上漾，裊裊漫浸，又遙　碧穹外，渺渺無窮……一切都很寧靜，和平—我奇怪：這裏居然有寧靜、和平，他們幾時逋逃這專來的？來自何方？是我疲乏了，想寧靜和平囑——世界上的寧聲，和平早已泯滅，死亡，這裏莫不是幻景？</p>
<p>我就和山之嶺道別。我又髣髴躺在水之涯，斜倚在磐石旁，穩穩地用手輕摩一邊茁壯的淺草，潤濕融滑淸新的香味，黑土之營養。偶囘頭，盼睞舊處的山，却成為一抹淡灰，山拗　　地，似是眉峯，美麗但憂愁！</p>
<p>一會，高山　盡了，淡灰　為茫茫的一片，血糊的一片。我驚訝：茫茫何處尋？（原來先前眞個是幻景！）一陣差恥襲進了心，於是我從磬石旁挺站了進來——　石却早腐爛。磐石消滅何速？脊往祗覺硬化了，呼吸有些窒息，揮手悄無語……我狂　，把狂嘯縈遶天地——給悲風帶去四方。不知何處却又回應過來天籟的古銅聲：洪隆！勞髴還遠樹叢中有幾點烏鴉　看虛偽的翅盼在跳，跳嘿，這是『寧靜』與『和平』嗎？虛偽呀小醜！我冷冷地笑了。</p>
<p>我又聽見依稀的衰弱的斷續鼓嗚，調和了冷冽的幽風襲來，似怒蛙，似老牛，更似寒蟲，却愈鬼嘯。它瑟瑟地橫過田哇，阡陌之中的靑翠，就焦，黃，枯，朽，這鼓嗚卻還緊抱著殘枝腐草舞蹈。</p>
<p>讓它舞蹈罷，這草骷髏的路舞！　不曾濃似酒，神經乏。</p>
<p>我這樣經過了美麗而縹渺的夢。她不曾濃似酒，神經的Curve在向上了。淸醒。</p>
<h3>不必等待</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>事業被　武者的侵略　蹄所摧殘的人，飯碗　武者的侵略鐵蹄所踏碎的人，眞不知道有多少—十九個月來，只聽到失業問題的日益嚴重，失業羣的數字日益增加—尤其是上海。</p>
<p>不幸而被捲進了失業旋渦的人，其唯一的期望和工作，無疑的就是懇親求友代謀職業，終日徘徊於親友之門，虛聲下氣，把熱面孔去碰冷面孔。</p>
<p>然而，事實吿訴我們，在現在懇親求友代謀職業的結果，十有九是得來幾句：『現在謀事眞是困難，但請勿急，等到最後勝利之後，總有辦法……』的摩登安慰語；似乎等到最後勝利之後，就立刻有事可做，這種『摩登」的說法，不但是被請求者用以安排央業者的最好方法，卽失業者的本身也多以此自慰。</p>
<p>我們難不否認，在最後勝利之後謀職業比較現在容易，但是，我們却不敢贊同一般失業者坐守家園，以待最後勝利。因為將來的建設時期，必然的，是需要有充分的學識，有豐富的技能，有勇毅的精神有强健的體魄的人才，來建設新中國，决不致於會需要一般平平庸庸，空無所有的人物來共同吃飯；換一句話說，就是：沒有學識，技能，體魄的人，等到最後勝利之後，畢竟還是要做被時代遺棄的殘渣，將來的境遇未必能優於現在。而相反的，有學識，有技能，有適合於現實社會所需要的本領，卽處在失業巨潮澎湃洶湧的現在，也有不被捲入失業漩渦的可能。</p>
<p>所以，失了業的人——尤其是困居於「孤島」的，絕不能被親友們的摩登安慰語所矇誤，也不能因為謀職困難，而把一個期望託到最後勝利之後，只要先檢點一下自己，就可肯定自己的命運。倘若自已沒有獨特的學識，技能等等，就要設法補救自已的缺點，修養自己的學識，練習自己感興趣的技能，鍛鍊自己的衰弱體質，使之合於最後勝利之後的國家，社會所需的人才，就無虞失衆的鞭子來抽撻了。記得高爾基曾說過：「愚笨的人才怕失業，失業的恐怖只襲進愚笨人的腦海……」這兩句話給我們的教訓，就是要我們不怕失業，自己製造出克制失業的能力來。</p>
<p>內地，無論那一處，抗戰建國的工作都是緊張的，沒有一處不歡迎各部門的眞正人才，去共同完成復興的大業；有學識，有技能的人才，正不必困居『孤島』，叩求親友之門，虛聲下氣去領略幾句『摩登』的安慰語，也不必等待最後勝利之後，有一技之長，儘可站到民族解放的大　下去工作，把智和力去換取最後勝利；不但要解决自己的飢餓問題，並且，還要更進一步解决整個的失業問題，為多數的失業羣解决生活。</p>
<p>所以，我們可以說，坐守家園，等候最後勝利之後再想辦法的失業靑年。眞無異是自己拋棄職業。</p>

        <h1>1939.05.21</h1>
<h3>The Responsibility of China and the Soviet Union for World Peace</h3>
<p>For over twenty months, the Japanese war of aggression against China has, due to our China's staunch resistance, created a dilemma for Japan. This is a fact already understood by the whole world and needs no further detailed explanation. Recently, on February 10th, Japan suddenly changed direction and attacked Hainan Island. This move exposes the deeper layers of the Japanese militarists' ambition. Hainan Island is an island off the southern end of China's Leizhou Peninsula, similar in size to Taiwan, about a hundred miles from Annam, and about forty miles from Guangzhou Bay, facing the South China Sea and opposite the Philippines. Its location is sufficient to control the South China Sea and the Gulf of Tonkin, and to cut off the passage between Hong Kong and Singapore. From Japan's point of view, Japan must pass through Hainan Island to reach Australia, Southeast Asia, India, and even Europe. Therefore, Japan has been scheming to acquire Hainan Island as a gateway for Japan to the south, in order to control Annam, India, Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and even Honolulu for decades, without ever letting go. This time, Japan's war of aggression against our country has expanded to its current state, based on the Japanese militarists' misjudgment of our country, which has consumed at least two-thirds of their land and air combat power, while our China has become stronger in fighting, which has already doomed their failure. Only because our country lacks a navy can he retain most of his naval power, which has not been used. This time, the attack on Hainan Island is on the one hand to use his remaining part of the force to make a final threat to our country, and on the other hand to take advantage of the unrest in Europe to provoke Britain and France. It can both support his allies Germany and Italy in Europe, and hope to complete the good dream of seizing Hainan Island and controlling the South Pacific for decades by chance. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "The Japanese army's incursion into Hainan Island this year is equivalent to the occupation of Shenyang on September 18, 1931. In other words, Japan's attack on Hainan Island is tantamount to creating a 'September 18th Incident' on the Pacific." This can be said to have pinpointed the ambition of the Japanese militarists. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese War has entered a new stage of significance. This new significance means that Japan has begun to attack the world.</p>
<p>The reason why I am now speaking to the people of the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union is a peace-loving country. Not only does it love peace, but it also has the ambition to safeguard world peace. The Soviet Union's efforts in the League of Nations and other international aspects in recent years have been the most definite proof of this ambition. Our China is also a peace-loving country and also has the ambition to safeguard world peace. Unfortunately, our country has been shackled by imperialism for many years. After the Xinhai Revolution, for more than twenty years, it has not been able to actively develop, so it only holds this ambition, and its contribution to world peace is very small. This time, the Japanese imperialists launched a large-scale aggression against us for no reason. We spared no effort to use the flesh and blood of the whole country to make a strong and unyielding resistance, so that the imperialists clearly recognize that terms such as humanity and justice are not ethereal things after all; and the ambitious people who are strong and domineering will eventually eat their own fruits. The reasonable answer we have given to the Japanese imperialists can at least be said to have assumed the advanced position of safeguarding world peace. Since China and the Soviet Union are both peace-loving countries and both have the ambition to safeguard world peace, and they also have deep relations in geography and history, it is necessary to make joint efforts to realize the common ambitions of China and the Soviet Union. In the past twenty months, Japan has attacked China, and the Soviet government and people have given China great sympathy and assistance. Now that Japan has begun its new meaning of aggression and is attacking the world, the tasks of China and the Soviet Union are even more important. I believe that the Soviet government and people will also pay more attention to this new meaning of Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>Japan is an island nation in the western Pacific. Fifty years ago, it was an invaded country like China. It only began to gain international status after winning the Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Later, it used Britain to form the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and then launched the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, defeating Imperial Russia. The success of these two attempts actually led Japan into a state of madness, scheming to complete its so-called dream of a continental policy. The content and purpose of the Guandong Continental Policy were most clearly stated in Tanaka Giichi's memorial. Tanaka's memorial said: "If we want to control China in the future, we must first defeat the United States. This is very similar to the significance of the Russo-Japanese War. However if we want to conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia. If we want to conquer world, we must first conquer China. If China can be completely conquered by us, others such as Asia Minor, India, Nanyang, etc., will respect me and even surrender to me. So that the world knows that East Asia is East Asia of my country, and will never dare to invade me. This is the legacy of Emperor Meiji, and it is also something that our Japanese Empire must do for its survival." However, Japan's continental policy is a policy of conquering the world. Originally, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance for thirty years (from 1902 to 1921), the first half was against Russia, and the second half was against the United States. Because Japan's policy of conquering the world takes conquering China as the first step. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Russia interfered and retreated from the Liaodong Peninsula, which the Japanese hated to the core. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan had seen through the emptiness of the content of Imperial Russia and was not deeply afraid; and the United States happened to have the idea of maintaining China's open door, which dealt a major blow to Japan's ambition to annex China alone. Therefore, in this period, Japan desperately pulled Britain to support itself, in order to cope with its obstacles to annexing China alone! Russia and the United States are the targets. At the Washington Conference in 1921, although the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was cancelled due to the pressure of the United States, Japan took advantage of the fact that all countries were not available to look to the East during the European War and had obtained many special interests from China and other aspects, and its wings had been formed. Therefore, in recent years, it has ignored everything and directly attacked our country, especially after the September 18th Incident. However, our country is not a country that can be despised lightly. It has a national history of five thousand years, and the progress of the revolutionary movement in recent years has promoted everything in our country to a new stage, clearly recognizing its own mission for its own country and nation, and for the world; and will never allow aggressors to be so rampant. Therefore, from the first cannon shot at Lugou Bridge, we immediately mobilized national human and material resources to resist. It is of course to protect the independence and survival of our own country and nation, but also to fight for world peace.</p>
<p>What I want to explain now is that Japan's consistent dream of conquering the world has not been awakened by the blows that our country has given him in the past twenty months. The recent change of direction and attack on the world is clear evidence. However, judging from Japan's national strength and the international situation it is in, it is just a desperate gamble. Judging from Japan's national strength, at the time of the current tense situation in Europe, it is daring to make a risky attempt on the British and French navies in the Far East with its remaining naval power. In terms of the international situation, although Germany and Italy are known as his allies, they are caught in the changes in the European situation and have a shallow relationship with the Far East, and they may not be willing or even have the strength to support Japan. Moreover, Japan's own contradictions have been stretched to the point of exhaustion. Even if he takes the risk of the world's great disapproval and launches an attack on the world, his future is unimaginable. We know that only peace is the true gospel of mankind. Now that most of the countries in the world, even including the people ruled by a few ambitious people, are standing on the line of peace, we can assert that humanity and justice are ultimately indelible terms, and that world peace will eventually be realized one day.</p>
<p>Who should bear the responsibility for realizing world peace? Our China and the Japanese aggressors have been dealing with each other for more than twenty months, and have actually eliminated two-thirds of the power of the Japanese army and air force. This has of course given a very serious blow to the Japanese imperialists. The Soviet Union is geographically in close contact with Japan, and its love of peace and its ambition to safeguard world peace are the same as those of China; in terms of national strength, it also has substantial strength, at least in the situation of storms and rains in the Far East, it stands in a very important position. At present, the path of the Japanese imperialists' challenge to the world seems to have a trend of heading south from attacking Hainan Island, but from his consistent ambition to conquer the world, both southward and northward advances are just a matter of procedure. In order to uphold humanity and justice, and to maintain world peace, we will never allow such ambitious people to exist, and there is no need to pay attention to the direction of his first attack. We only hope that all peace-loving countries and people in the world will jointly take the responsibility of giving blows to the blowers; and in the current time when the flames of war are raging in the Far East, it is especially hoped that the Soviet Union, which has close ties with the Far East.</p>
<h3>World Trends of the Week From May 14th to 20th, Year 28</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>The world situation this week can be aptly described as "spring clouds beginning to unfold," bringing us much heartening news. The most important aspects are the continued progress in Anglo-Soviet negotiations, the strengthening of Anglo-American friendship, the demonstrative actions taken by Britain, the United States, and France regarding the Gulangyu and Shanghai concession incidents, and the enthusiastic global support for China and boycott of Japan. Moreover, our ongoing War of Resistance against Japan has seen new victories, particularly those of our forces in central Hubei and northern China, inflicting severe blows on the Japanese forces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fascist aggressor nations of Germany and Italy are still preparing for further speculative and adventurous wars. The Japanese fascists in the Far East, in a state of extreme distress and boredom, have begun to make overtures to Britain and the United States, while secretly preparing for even more ruthless offensives. However, generally speaking, with the anti-aggression movement becoming increasingly consolidated and developed, fascist aggressors are indeed encountering difficulties they never imagined. If we can make greater efforts to overcome the remaining weaknesses within the anti-aggression front, intensify the practical struggle against aggression, and increase the internal and external difficulties and threats to the aggressors, then a second world war can still be averted, and the genuine peace we seek can be realized sooner!</p>
<p>(1) Progress of the Anti-Aggression Movement</p>
<p>The anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement has made significant progress this week, manifested in concrete facts: First, the British and Turkish authorities jointly announced on the 12th their decision to establish an agreement. The specific terms of this agreement are said to be still under negotiation, but in principle, should any act of aggression lead to war in the Mediterranean region, Britain and Turkey are prepared for effective cooperation, providing each other with all assistance and supplies. Following this news, there are rumors of a Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement being announced soon, which comes from the French side, so the credibility is naturally high. On the 17th, news of a secret agreement between the Soviet Union and Turkey also spread around the world, reportedly containing the following: (1) Any act of aggression sufficient to disrupt the status quo in the Balkan Peninsula will be jointly opposed by the Soviet Union and Turkey; (2) If war breaks out, the Soviet Union and Turkey should cooperate to deal with it with all resources and strength. Turkey, geographically, not only controls the key to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea but also controls the Eurasian transportation artery from the Mediterranean Sea via the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. The close alliance of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Turkey against aggression is of great significance not only for Southeast Europe and the Near East but also for the Far East and the entire world. Second, the negotiations for mutual assistance between Britain and the Soviet Union, after a period of stalemate, have shown progress again this week. After British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky on the 17th, the British response to the Soviet Union was sent to Moscow on the 18th. It is said that Britain has accepted the proposal of mutual assistance in principle, agreeing to assist the Soviet Union when it is attacked for defending Poland, Romania, and Turkey, that is, to supply the Soviet Union with the military and financial resources of Britain and France. However, Britain refuses to extend the guarantee to the Baltic Sea region at present. The Soviet Union immediately replied to the British on the 19th, insisting that a tripartite mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union be concluded first, to guarantee the countries of Eastern Europe, to avoid giving fascist aggressors an opportunity, and to prevent Britain's anti-aggression movement from becoming a deceitful fraud. Now, far-sighted politicians in Britain and the French authorities are urging the British government to conclude an agreement as soon as possible, and a clearer conclusion is expected next week. Third, the friendly relationship between Britain and the United States continues to grow. In the past few days, the King and Queen of England have been very popular in Canada, with cheers resounding throughout the day, and the American people have unanimously responded to British public opinion, hoping that the visit of the King and Queen of England to Canada and the United States will enhance the friendly relationship between Britain and the Americas. At the same time, the British government is also determined to implement barter trade between Britain and the United States to promote the friendly relations between the two countries. British-American cooperation is of great significance for Europe, especially for the Far East, and we must strive to achieve it.</p>
<p>(2) New Activities of Germany, Italy, and Japan</p>
<p>Fascist aggressors have new activities. On the one hand, they are intensifying their efforts to undermine the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement, and on the other hand, they are stepping up the deployment of a new imperialist war. (1) Regarding the former, they have adopted two methods. First, they are still inciting and colluding with small countries. Recently, this has been manifested in the fact that Italy is instigating conflicts between Bulgaria and Greece and Yugoslavia (see the Hai Tong News Agency's Budapest dispatch on the 13th); Italy is colluding with Yugoslavia (see the Hai Tong News Agency's Rome dispatch on the 13th, "Yugoslav Regent Meets the Pope"); provoking disputes between Bulgaria and Romania and taking the opportunity to win them over (see the Reuters London dispatch on the 13th); Germany and Italy are making every effort to acquire Romania commercially (see the Hai Tong News Agency's Berlin dispatch on the 14th: "German-Romanian Commercial Agreement Has Been Established," Reuters Rome dispatch on the 18th: "Italian-Romanian Agreement on Exchange of Goods Has Been Established"); and luring Yugoslavia to join the German-Italian axis (see the 19th [source missing]). Although attempts to persuade Finland, Sweden, and Norway have been thwarted (Reuters reported on the 17th that the three countries rejected Germany's proposal), negotiations with Denmark, Estonia, and Latvia are said to be "completed" (see Reuters Berlin dispatch on the 18th). Second, they are disrupting negotiations on a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the United States, and concentrating their efforts on inciting and threatening the stubborn and reactionary elements within the British government. The fact that Britain has not yet been able to sincerely conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union is due in no small part to the obstruction of stubborn and reactionary elements. Recently, Japan has even begun to make overtures to Britain and the United States. The British House of Commons discussed the incident on the 17th when Japan attempted to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Britain. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita even expressed Japan's "sincerity" in resolving the US-Japan issue without hindering American interests in China when bidding farewell to the US Ambassador to Japan on the 18th and advised the United States not to adopt international cooperation and other forms. (2) Regarding the latter, this week, it has been manifested in the fact that the German-Italian axis is strengthening its solidarity. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive in Berlin today (the 21st) and is scheduled to formally sign a political and military agreement tomorrow. After the military agreement is signed, King Emmanuel of Italy will also go to Berlin to strengthen the unity of the aggressor axis. Berlin is preparing a grand welcome. Second, Germany's threat to Poland is becoming more serious. A large number of German troops have already been concentrated in the Moravian region on the Polish border; according to a Havas News Agency London dispatch on the 18th, thousands of German Nazi troops, including 3,000 members of Hitler's guard, have secretly infiltrated Danzig. Another report says that as many as 20,000 German troops have arrived in Danzig. Third, Hitler and Mussolini both inspected the defense lines along the French border on the 16th. Military engineering projects in both countries are currently being rushed to completion. Fourth, they are preparing to conclude a military alliance with Spain, and in practice, they are preparing to intensify military work on the Spanish-French border and in Gibraltar, preparing to threaten Britain and France. On the 19th, Spain held a celebration of "victory" under the instigation of Germany and Italy, which can be seen as a demonstration by the aggressors against the democratic and peaceful countries of Britain, France, and the United States, and a cruel sneer at all hypocritical and cowardly policies of appeasement!</p>
<p>In summary, this week's events show that fascist aggression has indeed encountered new difficulties, but they are carrying out more cruel and vicious conspiracies!</p>
<p>(3) Major Demonstrations by Britain, the United States, and France Against Japan</p>
<p>Following the progress of the anti-aggression movement and the increasingly rampant speculation and adventurism in the Far East, democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, the United States, and France have finally taken relatively tough steps to deal with Japanese provocations. The first step is to deal with the Japanese occupation of Gulangyu. On the 17th, warships from Britain, the United States, and France stationed in the Far East each sent sailors to land on Gulangyu. The total number was evenly matched with the Japanese sailors who landed there. British Navy Commander Noble issued a serious warning to the Japanese authorities that there should be no changes to the Gulangyu Municipal Council. It is now reported that the Japanese sailors have secretly withdrawn from the area. The second step is to deal with Japan's preparation to seize the concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou. On the 19th, the British, American, and French authorities implemented emergency martial law in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession. Troops, detectives, and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps were fully mobilized, and barbed wire fences were added everywhere in the concession, as if facing a major event. Before the Japanese launched an armed seizure, they carried out a major demonstration against Japan. This emergency action can be said to be the first powerful and concerted response from Britain, the United States, and France since Japan implemented a comprehensive rejection of European and American powers in the Far East, this response showed the firm opposition of Britain, the United States, and France to Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia" and the determination to defend their rights and interests in China and the Far East. No wonder the Japanese authorities were alarmed when they heard about it - Japanese newspapers have expressed panic in their articles these days, and the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs even declared on the 19th that this matter was "extremely regrettable"! However, we still need to clearly point out three points here: First, Japan's plan to seize concessions and exclude European and American powers in the Far East is based on the necessity of the development of Japanese capitalist imperialism and its national policy of establishing hegemony in East Asia. In the future, conflicts with European and American powers will only develop and are difficult to reconcile. Today, in order to solve its serious military, political, and economic difficulties in invading China, it will intensify its seizure steps, and unless it suffers a fatal blow, it will never stop or back down. Second, the current joint action and demonstration by Britain, the United States, and France are not yet powerful enough to give Japan a fatal blow, and actions such as banning the Yi Bao, Wen Hui, Da Mei, and Sino-American newspapers that aid China, as well as various interferences with all legitimate patriotic speech and actions of the Chinese people, such as hanging national flags, are [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text]. Third, for the sake of the interests of Britain, the United States, France, and other friendly nations and the true peace of the Far East, today, after continuing to demonstrate against Japan, all friendly nations should immediately further negotiate close political, military, and economic cooperation and take broader and more practical steps to support China and boycott Japan, pressuring Japan to abandon its speculative and adventurous fascist aggression policy. To demand its effective success, the first thing is to achieve a decisive victory in China's War of Resistance against Japan. Without the victory of China's War of Resistance as a basis, all guarantees of peace cannot exist in isolation.</p>
<p>(4) The International Aid China Movement is Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The progress of the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement is actually of great help to our country's War of Resistance and national construction. At present, the Soviet Union's firm advocacy of concluding a tripartite mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, its firm advocacy that the anti-aggression front should include the Far East, and its efforts to cooperate with countries in the Near East and the United States are all of great help to our War of Resistance and national construction. In addition, in the past week, the international Aid China movement has also had new manifestations. On the American side, our Zhenwei Association representative, Bishop Yu Bin, was warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese and people from all walks of life in the United States. Bishop Yu's anti-war propaganda work has been extremely successful. Archbishop Doherty of Philadelphia, one of the three major archbishops in the United States, initiated a welcome for Bishop Yu and instructed all parishioners in the region to do their best to help and rescue Chinese refugees. According to a Havas News Agency Washington dispatch on the 16th, the US Congress has a very friendly attitude towards China and will never pass any Neutrality Act or other legislation that would hinder China's War of Resistance. As for the broad masses of American workers, they are unanimously willing to fight to aid China's War of Resistance and sanction Japanese aggression. In Britain, the Aid China movement has been particularly enthusiastic recently. A delegation composed of three nobles, Snell, Cecil, and Listowel, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax on the 19th, urging the British government to use all its power at the Geneva Conference to ensure that the League of Nations takes active action to aid China. The British Parliament has held enthusiastic discussions on aiding China and boycotting Japan in recent days. The Sino-British Cultural Association held its fourth annual meeting in Chongqing on the 16th. British Chairman Karl gave a speech, admiring the spirit of our people in persisting in the War of Resistance and believing that the relationship between China and Britain will become increasingly close. The French side has also become more firm in its attitude towards Japan. According to a message from the French Embassy in Chongqing on the 19th, a French government delegation has come to the East to investigate the conversion of coastal defenses into free ports and will allow the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to provide various facilities for large-scale transportation. In addition, countries have unanimously condemned the recent atrocities of Japanese aircraft in China. People from all walks of life in the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and other countries have successively sent messages of condolence. Sir Cecil, chairman of the Anti-Aggression General Association, also sent a message of condolence and expressed his respect to us for our unified and heroic War of Resistance, and said that he firmly believes that the [Japanese] will be defeated by us, urging our country to strengthen unity and persist in the protracted War of Resistance.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic aid to China from international figures is the result of our heroic persistence for twenty-two months. In the future, we must of course unite and persist in the War of Resistance even more, to win more and greater sympathy and assistance from the international community, and to realize the victory of the War of Resistance ahead of schedule. However, when we look back at past foreign propaganda, especially national diplomacy, it is indeed still very insufficient. At present, the War of Resistance has entered a new and critical stage, and we cannot but double our efforts in this regard. The League of Nations Executive Council meeting is approaching, and our Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, and Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, went to Geneva together on the 19th. When they passed through Paris, they will attend together with our Ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, on behalf of our country. Today, we highly urge the government to [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] our representatives to redouble their efforts. On the one hand, they must carry out national diplomacy and promote [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] representatives attending to achieve the goal of all countries implementing effective pressure on Japan and providing practical assistance to our country!</p>
<p>(5) The Situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan This Week</p>
<p>The focus of the war this week is still in the Hubei-Henan area, especially in the area east of Xiangyang and Fancheng in Hubei, but the fighting is also very fierce in North China and East China, especially in various parts of North China. The fighting in South China is still fiercely ongoing in the Pearl River Delta, but neither side has made significant progress. Over the past week, our troops in Hubei and Henan have won successive battles, not only shattering the Japanese's delusional "encirclement of our twenty divisions," but also inflicting a total of 17,000 to 18,000 casualties on the Japanese forces after two weeks of bloody battles in northern Hubei and southern Henan, reaching one-third of the total strength of their main invading forces in central China. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Luoyang on the 15th, our army's recapture of Tanghe this time resulted in the killing or wounding of thousands of Japanese troops in just one night of fierce fighting! Now, the Japanese plan to invade Xiangfan has been largely crushed. Our army in Hubei and Henan has realized active operations, controlling the overall situation, and continuing to fight fiercely with the Japanese in the area north of Suizhou and Zaoyang and south of Tongbai and Xinye. The situation is already optimistic. Second, in North China, our army has won another major victory this week. According to a Reuters dispatch from Peiping on the 18th, the various detachments of our Eighth Route Army advancing into Rehe Province are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. In the central region of Hebei Province, the strength of the guerrillas has increased even more against the Japanese, and the Japanese army that invaded these areas this spring has been forced to completely withdraw. Although some villages east of the Pinghan Railway are still occupied by the Japanese army, they have been trapped and have lost the ability to control various places. The war in Suiyuan has also been very fierce recently, and nearly a thousand Japanese have been killed in two weeks during April and May. The fighting on the PingSui and PingHan railways has also continued. The war on the eastern front has also made progress. Our army in northern Jiangsu broke into Xuzhou again on the evening of the 16th and burned down the Japanese puppet organs. Along the Jinpu, Huhang, Sujia, Jinghang, and Jingwu lines, wars also occur from time to time. For example, our army in the area between the Huhang and Sujia roads broke into Tongxiang on the evening of the 15th and severely suppressed the Japanese. On the southern front, after General Bai Chongxi, Director of the General Staff, inspected northern Guangdong and held an important meeting last week, further counter-offensive military operations have been gradually launched. According to a dispatch from Shaoguan on the 19th, our army in Guangdong is now counter-attacking on one hand and strengthening its forces on the other. The Japanese army in Dongjiang has achieved nothing, and anti-war incidents have occurred frequently among the Japanese in Beijiang. The Japanese in Zengcheng and Conghua have often been suspected, disarmed, and detained. In the lower reaches of the Xijiang River, the Japanese have not yet withdrawn. Although the fierce battle in Jianghui has resulted in the capture and recapture of the city, it is still under our control. Our army near Jiangmen has even advanced to Duruancun. The Japanese in the Pearl River Delta, without reinforcements continuing to arrive, have obviously become exhausted.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, although the Japanese have tried their best to covet Xiangfan in order to lay the foundation for their advance into the Northwest, their military strength is still unable to carry out a new large-scale offensive, and various difficulties continue to increase. Therefore, their main purpose is still to passively try to attack our front-line counter-offensive, strengthen their control and rule over the occupied areas, and prepare for a large-scale offensive in the future. The Japanese's attempt to seize concessions in Shanghai and other places and land in Gulangyu is not only to exclude European and American powers in the Far East, but also to give a political and economic blow to our post-defeat battles and facilitate their control over the occupied areas. In the future, the Japanese seem likely to launch large-scale offensives on the PingHan, YueHan railways, and the Chaoshan-Shaoguan-XiangGui roads.</p>
<p>There are two points that we cannot ignore here: First, regarding Japan, we must also estimate that there are now three forces preventing the Japanese from advancing: First, the enhanced combat effectiveness of our front-line troops; second, the joint demonstration against Japan by Britain, the United States, and France; and third, the severity of Japan's economic crisis. As for us, we must also estimate that at a time when the internal and external situation is becoming increasingly favorable, there are still many obstacles, namely, (1) Although Wang Jingwei's [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] actions have failed, the erroneous ideas of compromise and [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] of all Wang's faction, wavering elements, and stubborn elements have not yet been completely eliminated, so spiritual mobilization, unity, protracted war of resistance, still need to be more extensive and in-depth propaganda. (2) The continued existence and development of the forces and tendencies that [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] total mobilization of national strength and the international Aid China boycott Japan movement is also a fact that needs to be paid close attention to in the new and serious stage of the current War of Resistance. We must step up the promotion of political progress to realize the democratic spirit, improve the people's livelihood, and expand international propaganda as the basic work for winning victory. For example, the National Production Conference, which ended this week, requires that its resolutions be seriously implemented and that production and construction be effectively increased to support the War of Resistance and national construction. It is impossible to ignore the above-mentioned basic work!</p>

<h3>Our Army Advances on Multiple Routes in Sui and Zao, Recapturing Numerous Strongholds on the East Bank of the Xiang River; The Situation in Southern Henan Remains Tense with Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] The × offensive in central Hubei and southern Henan has weakened, and the overall situation has shifted under our control. All villages and towns between Zhangjiaji and Xiaohongshan on the east bank of the Xiang River have been recaptured, and we are mopping up the remaining × forces. There was fierce fighting between our forces and the × forces between Zhongxiang and Changshoudian, resulting in significant gains. In the Sui County and Zao Yang area, the × forces are still resisting stubbornly. Our army is advancing on multiple routes, and the war situation is improving.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] The war in central Hubei in the past few days was extremely fierce. Both Chinese and Japanese forces suffered heavy casualties in Gucheng, Jingmen, Yicheng, Fancheng, and Huang'an. Currently, the first line of the Chinese army has advanced to the area between Xiangyang, Xinye, Tanghe, and Tongbai. Fresh troops have been added to cooperate with the southern route forces. At the same time, the southern route forces are intercepting the Japanese army on the Han-Yi Highway, forcing them to Zhenxiang, forming a semi-circular formation to block the Japanese army's advance. Furthermore, the Japanese army's rear lines have also been intercepted. The Japanese army's plan to occupy Xiangyang on the Han River was forced to be abandoned. They can only gather their forces and attempt to attack Xiangyang, where the large Chinese army is stationed. According to Chinese military sources, the Chinese army's ability to quickly withdraw without being surrounded by the Japanese army proves the new mechanized units of the Chinese army in the second phase of the war. It is also said that news from the front line is delayed, so the number of losses on both sides in recent days has not been confirmed, but it is believed to be very significant.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 20th] According to Chinese war reports, after two days of bloody battles, the Chinese army has recaptured Zao Yang, and over ten × Japanese soldiers have been annihilated. Tianmen has also been recaptured. The Chinese army is attempting to cut off the Japanese army's communication between Jingmen and Yingcheng and is engaged in fierce battles near Yiheji. The weather has been extremely hot, around 100 degrees, which is not conducive to military operations due to the fear of epidemics. Therefore, both Chinese and Japanese forces are vying for strongholds, it is said. This is believed to be a major battle before the Japanese army advances on Changsha. The Japanese army has now abandoned its full-line advance and is implementing breakthroughs with large units, resulting in repeated strong guerrilla attacks on their flanks, and their rear transportation lines are in imminent danger.</p>
<h3>Fierce Guerrilla Warfare in Lu and Ji</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] 1. Our army in Shandong Province has achieved a great victory in recent days, killing hundreds of × Japanese soldiers and capturing a large number of weapons. 2. After Commander Chiba was killed by our forces, the two commanders, Yimaru Oka and Hirata, engaged in fierce battles with our teams in Feicheng and Pingyin on the 11th. Maruoka was killed in battle, and Hirata was seriously injured. 3. All × Japanese soldiers in Shanghe were annihilated by our forces on the 12th night, and the county seat was recaptured. 4. Our plainclothes team attacked the Jinan Commercial Port on the 1st, killing more than 20 × Japanese soldiers in the puppet Preparatory Bank. At dawn on the 3rd, they attacked Guanzhaying, stormed into the × Japanese camp, and all 30+ × Japanese soldiers were killed. 5. Commander Shoushima, who was defending Qingyun, asked our forces through the Hui Father to not attack again. 6. Huang Zhentai's unit of more than 1,000 puppet troops in Cangzhou defected to our side, and we rewarded them with 6,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>All-Out Attack in Northern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 19th] The war on the west bank of the Fu River is quiet, but in the Wuyang area, the × Japanese cannons occasionally fire at us, making a show of force to prevent our advance. The × Japanese forces have increased in Xiangtang, Shabu, Tanxincun, and other places, and they are building defensive works.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 19th] The war situation in northern Jiangxi has improved since we launched a full-scale attack against the × Japanese forces from the latter part of last month. Apart from the recent left-wing aspects, we successively captured Gao'an, Gao You City, Xiangfu Temple, Fenghuang Mountain, Yajiuling, and surrounded Fengxin City three times, and once occupied Zhanggongdu. Among them, the battles near Gao'an and Fenghuang Mountain (about 5 kilometers south of Fengxin) were the most intense. The × Japanese casualties were over 3,000, including the deaths of three high-ranking × Japanese officers, including Suzuki Takashi, the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Independent Mountain Artillery 2nd Regiment. Five were captured alive, and eight × Japanese field guns, more than 200 cans of unused poison gas, and more than 30 boxes of other documents and military supplies, as well as countless grain supplies, were seized. On the right wing, our attacking troops entered Nanchang City twice and engaged in fierce battles with the × Japanese forces inside and outside Nanchang City. The × Japanese casualties were more than 3,500. Later, the × Japanese forces urgently increased reinforcements. We retreated from the suburbs after achieving our goal of annihilating the × Japanese forces. As for the units that crossed the Jin River from the front, they successively captured Dacheng, Wanshou Palace, Shengmi Street, and once reached Niuxing and Lehua Railway Station, disrupting the × Japanese rear transportation and communication, also achieving results. In summary, the total number of casualties of the × Japanese forces in this attack in northern Jiangxi should exceed 10,000. Moreover, the quality of their soldiers is declining, and the atmosphere of war-weariness and anti-war sentiment is increasing. In the mouths of the captured × Japanese soldiers, there is no shortage of phrases such as "I only received two months of military training and was conscripted to the front line in China. How can I fight this battle?" and "When I was on guard on the front line in southern China, looking up at the sky, I thought of home, and my head drooped down." As for our army, this reporter once saw a certain unit crossing the Jin River to the front line three times, and saw that our army was in an active position, with both manpower and firepower capable of being used flexibly, encircling and annihilating the × Japanese army everywhere. Therefore, the morale is as strong as it has ever been. In addition, the relationship between the military and the people is also more harmonious than before. Wounded soldier rest stations and tea and water supply stations have been widely established along the way. The subsequent transportation of wounded and sick officers and soldiers, and the forward supply of ammunition and food, are all regulated by post stations, with transportation teams and ancestral frames organized by various counties to transport them back and forth in an orderly manner. However, the most difficult thing for the front line now is the lack of medicines and medical supplies. Because the troops have been fighting on the front line for a long time, they are prone to illness. It is hoped that all sectors will rise up to donate and provide practical and effective assistance.</p>
<h3>Continuous Cannon Fire at Tongguan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 19th] The × Japanese forces at Fenglingdu have been continuously shelling the Tongguan military since the 18th, firing more than ten shells every four or five minutes. A × Japanese plane circled in the air to indicate targets. Our artillery responded with counterattacks, and many shells landed in the × Japanese positions. By noon on the 19th, seven × Japanese planes flew over our territory and bombed, but we suffered no losses. It is reported that the × Japanese forces on the north bank are also firing continuously.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 20th] On the 19th noon, more than 700 × Japanese soldiers from Jiaozuo, along with more than 40 cavalrymen, arrived in Qinyang, led by the × Japanese commander Dongze, and advanced towards our defending troops in Wanzhuang (20 miles west of Boai). × Japanese planes also flew in to assist in the battle. Our army calmly responded, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. In addition, more than 200 × Japanese soldiers once infiltrated Xinghe District, but were met with a head-on attack by our defending troops. After three hours of fierce fighting, the × Japanese soldiers were unable to withstand the attack and retreated to Xingtai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 18th] A certain army of ours entered the Wang Detachment in Suidong. Recently, they have successively carried out large-scale destruction of the railway north of Fengzhen, as well as the bridges and power lines on the motor road between Fengzhen and Guisui Zhuozishan. The × Japanese forces are unable to travel. The Wang Detachment has captured many villages and towns in Suidong. The local people, oppressed by the × Japanese and exploited by traitors, felt like they had seen the light of day again when they suddenly saw the National Army arrive. They are all willing to serve as vanguards and serve the country. The detachment is now both appeasing the people and actively continuing to destroy without end. Father Leimingyuan</p>
<h3>Father Leimingyuan Pays Respects to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] Leimingyuan, head of the North China War Zone Service Corps, arrived in Shaanxi from the front line on the 18th and immediately went to Chongqing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, report on everything, and make requests.</p>
<h3>The British Side's Firm Attitude on the Shanghai International Settlement Issue; The Settlement's Administrative Agency Refuses to Change</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] According to official information received here, the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, expressed support for the American viewpoint when discussing the Shanghai International Settlement issue with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, namely that it is not appropriate to discuss changing the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement at this time. Ambassador Craigie went on to express the British opinion on the Japanese proposal of May 3 regarding the reorganization of the Shanghai Settlement and, while supporting the American viewpoint, stated that this issue must be jointly discussed by other relevant countries, including China.</p>
<h3>× Japanese Forces Conduct Anti-British Propaganda in the Hongkou Area; Hongkou Police Did Not Intervene</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] Shanghai dispatch: On the 17th, an anti-British propaganda movement was held in the Hongkou area under the instigation of × Japanese people. On that day, four trucks slowly drove along various roads. The first truck was a military band playing marches. The next two trucks carried Chinese children of pre-school age, carrying a large number of anti-British leaflets, which they distributed along the way. The last truck carried a team of × Japanese soldiers. The leaflets incited Chinese people to be anti-British and discouraged Chinese people from depositing money in British banks. The Hongkou police did not intervene in this matter, only picking up the leaflets and sending them to the Central Police Station.</p>
<h3>Shanghai British Authorities Compile a List of British Nationals; Prepare to Conscript When Necessary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 20th] The British authorities here recently issued a notice stating that a list of male and female residents of British nationality has now been compiled, so that they can be requisitioned in the event of an emergency. Those concerned about this matter can inquire at the Consulate General for details. This notice is due to the amendment to the Conscription Act announced by the British House of Commons on the 17th of this month, which stipulates that British people abroad must also undergo military training.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the Gulangyu Incident</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The Manchester Guardian recently commented on the Gulangyu case. This matter can be compared to a scene in Shakespeare's famous play "Hamlet." In itself, it is not important and has a humorous flavor, using the small to imply the big, seeing the microcosm to know the whole picture. What the Japanese army is performing is to test the reaction of Western countries before taking action in Shanghai. However, the result has been clarified. Britain, the United States, and France have all sent warships to Gulangyu, and the US government has gone a step further and submitted a memorandum to the Japanese government, refusing to consider revising the Shanghai International Settlement Yangjingbang Land Charter. The wording of the memorandum is straightforward and penetrating, and it is a rare masterpiece of diplomatic documents. After the Japanese were flattered by the US President's special dispatch of a cruiser to transport the ashes of the late Japanese Ambassador to the United States back to Japan, considering it as a special favor from the United States to Japan, they should now know that this is not the case when they read this memorandum. More generally speaking, since the United States has cooperated with the relevant countries on the Gulangyu incident to protect its interests, it will probably adopt the same attitude towards Shanghai and other places in the Far East. Among the British, it is believed that if Britain signs a military alliance treaty with the Soviet Union, it may be enough to prompt Japan to change its policy.</p>
<h3>The People of Shaanxi and Hunan Are Eager to Kill × Japanese; Able-Bodied Men Voluntarily Enlist; Rural Women Send Their Sons to Join the Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tonghe, 18th] Yang Deshu, the Bao chief of Langjiang Township in this county, and others voluntarily enlisted to kill × Japanese. The township specially convened a grand farewell meeting, and the able-bodied men made generous speeches, vowing to complete the mission of resisting the war and building the country under the leadership's guidance. The voices and emotions were tragic and unprecedented. The able-bodied men were then transferred to the camp. The Bao chiefs of the township are loyal, brave, and patriotic. The township chief, Li Shiquan, has provided excellent guidance and is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] Gan Tai, a rural woman from Mian County, and Wang Ming and Lin Lucong, farmers from Lintong County, hate the invasion of the brutal × Japanese and have all sent their beloved sons to serve as soldiers. The authorities believe that these people have a deep understanding of righteousness and have issued a special order to commend them and presented them with a plaque.</p>
<h3>× Japanese Planes Bomb Mawei</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th] × Japanese planes dropped eight bombs on Mawei again yesterday. In the afternoon, they entered the air over Fuzhou City three times, flying low to spy.</p>
<h3>The × Japanese Forces in Guangzhou Arrest Able-Bodied Men in Large Numbers; Forced to Build Defensive Works</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, a certain place, 20th] The situation in Guangzhou has become tense. The × Japanese forces are arresting pedestrians in the streets in large numbers and forcibly conscripting thousands of able-bodied men, who are being taken to the suburbs to build fortifications and erect power lines.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Five-Minister Conference Concluded Yesterday Morning; Prime Minister Hiranuma Was Received in Audience to Report; The Content Is Rumored to Be Related to the European Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Five-Minister Conference concluded at 11:40 this morning. Afterwards, Prime Minister Hiranuma immediately entered the palace to report the cabinet's decisions to the Japanese Emperor. After Hiranuma reported the content of this morning's meeting to other cabinet members who did not attend the meeting, he will issue a statement, it is said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese cabinet held a special meeting this morning on a "final decision" regarding Japan's policy toward Europe. However, this decision has not yet been publicly announced.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] At the cabinet meeting on Saturday and Sunday, the attitude that Japan should take in dealing with the European situation, which has been discussed for several weeks, was finally decided. However, political figures have no way of knowing the content of the resolution. It is reported that Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai gave speeches at the meeting, examining the European political situation in detail. After the meeting, Prime Minister Hiranuma reported the situation of the meeting to the Japanese Emperor and distributed reports to all cabinet members who did not attend. It is said that Foreign Minister Arita will report on the international situation to the Privy Council on Wednesday and announce Japan's attitude towards various issues. [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Tokyo dispatch: Although officials refused to disclose the contents after the Five-Minister Conference ended on the 2nd, it is rumored that the content is unrelated to the German-Italian military alliance. Japan's position is to adopt a neutral attitude towards the European situation, express sympathy for the Axis powers, and provide moral assistance, it is said.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Production Conference (4)</h3>
<p>Capital - Absorbing Floating Capital</p>
<p>Agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, and transportation are the main points of national economic construction in the future. Despite our ignorance, we have presented them one by one. There are still several matters that, although not the production business itself, are essential for the development of production, and we respectfully inform the people of the country about them. The first is capital, trade, and finance. Our country is based on agriculture, and production capital is accumulated. On the day when we promote production, the need for capital is extremely great. In addition to developing national capital and utilizing industrial and commercial capital, we must absorb floating capital to collect small amounts into a large sum. The best way to absorb floating capital is to promote cooperative affairs, which can not only gather funds, but also invisibly educate farmers on production and marketing, and reduce the exploitation of farmers by merchants.</p>
<p>Trade Control</p>
<p>Production specialization must rely on commerce for circulation. The two not only complement each other, but their degree of development often progresses in proportion. In our country's commercial policy, due to the needs of the vast rural areas, small merchants should be given extra support, and government taxes should also be reduced as appropriate to show consideration and encouragement. In international trade, we not only advocate government management during wartime, but also hope that today's control policies will gradually become stricter to establish the foundation for government-run international trade after the war.</p>
<p>Financial Institutions</p>
<p>Financial circulation is the lifeblood of production enterprises and must adapt to the needs of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. As a result of more than ten years of government efforts, upper-level financial institutions have gradually become complete. However, local financial institutions still need to be continuously adjusted. Although they have been reformed through two local financial conferences, they have not yet reached a sound state. Since the War of Resistance, the government has insisted on avoiding inflation, and we cannot help but admire this cautious attitude. However, since production enterprises are expanding day by day in the future, the amount of legal tender must be adapted to the needs of production enterprises, which is also appropriate. We also hope to give full play to the effectiveness of banks to create a source of short-term funds, give full play to the effectiveness of trusts and savings to create a source of medium-term funds, and give full play to the effectiveness of life insurance to create a source of long-term funds. Modern production-developed countries all use banks, trusts, savings, and life insurance as methods to form and expand national funds and as protective charms to ensure the safety of national production enterprises.</p>
<p>Labor</p>
<p>Utilize Human Resources</p>
<p>The second is labor. To seek the development of production enterprises, we must use our country's innate strengths. Although our machinery and technology are far inferior to those of Europe and the United States, if we can make good use of the vast labor force of 450 million people and improve existing production methods, we may not be able to make up for the lack of machinery. We say this not to stick to old ways and forget the methods of industrial modernization, but because transportation is inconvenient, and machinery from abroad cannot be transported in large quantities. We cannot give up quenching our thirst because we are just looking at plums. Moreover, this production method, although not as convenient as mechanical production, also has its advantages, that is, it will not easily cause strong fluctuations in the industry like mechanical production, and there will be no danger of a large number of workers losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Relief for Unemployment</p>
<p>For two years, the industries in the war zones have been damaged, and most workers have fallen into the suffering of unemployment. At the same time, production enterprises in the rear feel extremely difficult due to the lack of skilled workers, resulting in infinite waste. The workers who have moved from the war zones to the rear are often not engaged in production or are engaged in unsuitable work due to a lack of adjustment, so they cannot use their talents to the fullest. This is a waste of national talents and an obstacle to production development. The members of this association believe that the government should pay special attention to the production enterprises in the war zones and guerrilla areas. At the same time, the investigation and adjustment of skilled workers in the rear and the method of recruiting skilled workers in the occupied areas should also be given special attention to avoid the utilization of × Japanese people.</p>
<p>Labor-Management Disputes</p>
<p>Labor-management disputes are a major problem in modern times. The proper resolution of this problem is not only related to the tranquility of social order, but also related to the cultivation of national productivity. Wage treatment should strive to be reasonable to create unity and cooperation between labor and management. Other things such as the establishment of employment agencies, the implementation of labor-management arbitration, and the equipment of worker health should all be done one by one to realize the ideals of the People's Livelihood Principle. In agriculture, we believe that the government should vigorously support self-cultivating small farmers so that they can live a prosperous life. We also believe that we should find ways to make tenant farmers gradually independent to realize the Party's ideal of "land to the tiller" and establish a solid foundation for the country.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Technical Talents</p>
<p>The third is production education. Production education is the source of production talents, and it is imperative to cultivate people for a hundred years. European and American countries have made this the basis for developing production. It is said that before the European War, Germany's industry was advancing without bounds, and its post-war recovery was rapid, all because of its large number of skilled workers. If this were not the case, even with perfect equipment and huge capital, it would be consumed and wasted invisibly due to poor management. China's lack today is not only the lack of high-level specialized talents, but especially the lack of low-level skilled workers. The government authorities should carefully consider the types and quantities of skilled workers needed by the country and implement large-scale production education as a quick remedy. The teaching materials of existing schools at all levels must be re-edited so that the education of schools at all levels is closely linked to production enterprises, so that teaching is not in vain and talents can be used to achieve the goal of cooperation between construction and teaching. Moreover, due to the poverty of the general people and the limited financial resources of the government, in addition to regular school regulations, we should also pay attention to the establishment of cram schools, the promotion of agriculture, and the implementation of factory internships to provide the general people with the convenience of studying. Women's education must also be fully promoted according to this principle so that women across the country have the opportunity to receive production education. If China's two hundred million women can be taught according to their talents so that they can participate in modern production and share the responsibility of resisting the war and building the country with men, then their contribution to the country will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Ordnance Talents</p>
<p>As for the training of ordnance technical talents, special talents are needed, and it is more difficult to implement. It should be the responsibility of the military organs to coordinate, but it should also be able to connect with the science and engineering courses of various universities and various production organs to prepare for the country's urgent needs. The President said: The foundation of our country's resistance is not in the shallow and narrow transportation areas along the river and coast, but in the vast and deep hinterland. The southwestern and northwestern provinces are especially the source of our resistance. Only the development of transportation and economy in the southwest and northwest can be a solid foundation for the long-term resistance and construction work.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This National Production Conference was held on the day when the soldiers on the front line were fighting bloody battles and making meritorious contributions to killing × Japanese soldiers, and under the threat of the brutal × Japanese planes' coercion and bombing. The members of this association are concerned about the seriousness of the national crisis and feel responsible for the country's safety. They have racked their brains and discussed day and night, hoping to contribute their meager strength to the development of transportation and economy in the southwest and northwest and to assist the Vice President's great strategy of governing the country and to comfort the government's earnest expectations. The realization of this great historical mission and the assumption of arduous responsibilities depend on the joint and consistent efforts of the people of the whole country. The members of this association will devote their efforts and respectfully follow the people of the country and work hard. It is hoped that the government and the people will devote their efforts and carefully strive for practicality in planning, economy in expenditure, and success in enterprises. Hard work and practical work will lead to success. The humiliation of the national situation has lasted for a hundred years. Adversity can revitalize the nation. The ancients have clear instructions. It is our responsibility to carry on the past and open up the future. The past two years of the War of Resistance have given us invaluable experience and lessons in the course of arduous struggle and have made us deeply confident that our descendants of the Yanhuang gods will surely be able to overcome great difficulties and stand on their own in today's world to promote the national glory of our old country with a new mission. The economic construction in the future will certainly prove the greatness of the Chinese nation's creative power, and we will be able to complete China's industrial revolution with our spare strength in the midst of the country's resistance against Japan, establish the foundation of the new China's production enterprises, and realize the central government's national policy of resisting Japan and building the country at the same time. We sincerely hope that the people of the country will encourage each other. At this conference, the Party and the Chairman of the National Government issued instructions amidst the urgency of military affairs. President of the Executive Yuan also personally presided over the meeting despite his fatigue and gave earnest instructions. The people of the country are grateful for the authorities' good intentions to follow the long-term plan and the deep heart of earnestly seeking governance. At the time of discussing and issuing a declaration, we respectfully express our support and gratitude. (End)</p>
<h3>Twenty Captives from the Guerrilla Zone</h3>
<p>— Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>[Fancheng Dispatch] Four months ago, the guerrilla zone in the Dabie Mountains was, in everyone's mind, like a child who had lost its mother, and fallen into Xiangyang. But the truth is not so; it sent word that it had grown up in the thickets; it sent people to say that it had driven the [Japanese] out of its gates. Recently, afraid that we wouldn't believe it, it sent twenty Japanese "brothers" to testify.</p>
<p>When I asked a military police officer where those twenty Japanese "brothers" were being kept, he pointed to a group of people in coarse cloth uniforms doing exercises in the square and said, "Those are them!" I was very surprised, because I had just passed by them, and I thought they were some recruits being trained.</p>
<p>"Japanese 'brothers,' this time you came from the Dabie Mountains, traveling more than a thousand *li* to get here; you must be very tired."</p>
<p>"Not at all!" A Japanese "brother" with round eyes replied bluntly, "It's really unexpected that we came to a place where the Chinese people gave us cigarettes and towels, and even held meetings to welcome us and send us off. Today, now that we're here, the people have given us shoes and socks and invited us to take a bath. We are really grateful and ashamed!"</p>
<p>Reuters reporter Mr. Smith was with us. He said that the Chinese people are truly generous and peace-loving.</p>
<p>I asked them with compassion.</p>
<p>A short, sturdy Japanese "brother" replied to me, "I am a crew member on the Unyu transport ship. I was captured by the local guerrillas because I was sent to the shore in Anqing to loot."</p>
<p>One with dark [complexion], named Morikawa, replied to me, "I am a poor farmer, forced to fight. I dream of home every day."</p>
<p>Two Japanese "brothers" standing together said to me:</p>
<p>"The guerrillas in Hefei attacked the Hefei Airport. We were pilots and were captured by them."</p>
<p>"The life of the Japanese people is already impossible without war, let alone now."</p>
<p>"The anti-warlord sentiment among the Japanese people is rising day by day."</p>
<p>This is what they said to me in unison.</p>
<p>A intellectual named Kubota Masaru analyzed Japan, saying: "Farmers - exhausted; workers - exploited; intellectuals - using the name of the country; soldiers - radical young officers; political parties - tails of the military; administration - increasing taxes; diplomacy - weak since ancient times."</p>
<p>Another person, Sato Shutaro, wearing rubber boots, said: "When I left Japan last June, Japanese society was in a recession. I know that twelve of my friends were imprisoned for opposing the war. Not a single Japanese laborer or farmer wants war. I heard that Tokyo is now heavily guarded to prevent anti-war movements."</p>
<p>"How many soldiers has Japan actually sent out, and how many times has conscription been carried out?" I asked a crew member who served on a transport ship.</p>
<p>"Before last October," he replied, "nearly two million people had been sent out, and conscription had been carried out thirty times, but I don't know now."</p>
<p>We talked about why Japan wanted to invade China. One, named Banmu, said: "In the country, I heard that after the Xi'an Incident, the Chinese Kuomintang and the Communist Party united. Japan wanted to prevent 'redification' and at the same time prevent the expansion of British power in the Far East, so it launched this war."</p>
<p>"Do you understand the true meaning of this war now?" I asked in return.</p>
<p>"The Japanese warlords caused this great chaos in order to get promoted and get rich," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>They complained to me that they were not acclimatized to the climate and soil when they came to China to fight, and nine out of ten people got sick. Fighting in the mountains, they couldn't find their way and couldn't find food. In winter, four people shared one quilt. They spoke as frankly as children.</p>
<p>"Do you know what stage the war has reached now?"</p>
<p>"Although we don't know what stage the war has reached now," one Japanese "brother" replied, "we have come here to guarantee China's victory."</p>

<h3>Soviet Ambassador Declares No Change in Viewpoint Rejects Latest British Proposal Again Halifax to France for Consultation</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 20th) British Foreign Secretary Halifax, now en route to Geneva, will arrive in Paris today to meet with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet to discuss British-Soviet negotiations. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has also set out for Geneva to attend the League of Nations meeting to be held on Monday.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, London, 10th) Yesterday the British government decided to change its policy and negotiate with Poland and Romania in an attempt to eliminate "various obstacles," as the Soviet Union may believe that assisting Poland and Romania only when requested would damage its reputation. According to political circles here, the focus of future negotiations will not be in Geneva, but in London, and the main figure will be Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, as Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin cannot personally attend the League of Nations meeting. The first step in the new British policy is today's meeting between the British and French foreign ministers in Paris. Once the two sides have agreed on a plan, the British ambassador to Poland and the minister to Romania will contact the governments of their respective countries to explore their attitudes towards a British-Soviet agreement, and present the results for discussion at the British cabinet meeting next Wednesday to determine the next steps. Diplomatic circles here are currently very optimistic and expect that Britain and the Soviet Union can reach an agreement next week. It is reported that the British cabinet has decided to accept the Soviet conditions, and will also accept the French proposals for accompanying military conditions. According to news from the capital of Romania, Romania no longer rejects the Soviet guarantee, and Poland's attitude is no longer as rigid as before. According to news from Warsaw, Poland will not take any steps before Britain announces its readiness to enter into an alliance with the Soviet Union. However, the issue of whether Poland and Romania will also participate in the British, French, and Soviet alliance and enjoy the same rights remains unresolved and requires consideration. The only countries left are the three small Baltic states, but whether these issues will be raised for discussion in Geneva is still unknown.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th] Before the British House of Commons met today, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited the British Foreign Office again to deliver the Soviet Union's reply rejecting Britain's latest proposal. The Soviet reply insisted on the conclusion of a tripartite mutual assistance agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the British Foreign Office this morning and met with Foreign Office advisor Sir Vansittart. It is reported that the Soviet Ambassador informed Vansittart of the Soviet government's response to what they discussed on Wednesday. The details of the two men's talks this morning were recorded and submitted to Chamberlain for reference before Chamberlain's speech to the House. In the past day or two, the British government has not issued new instructions to its ambassador to the Soviet Union. According to Reuters, although Britain and the Soviet Union do not entirely agree on the method of anti-aggression, it is believed that it can be eliminated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] Soviet Ambassador Maisky left for Geneva via Paris at 10 p.m. tonight. Beforehand, British government diplomatic advisor Vansittart had asked to meet with him again at 7 p.m. (the two had already concluded a meeting in the morning), asking whether the Soviet government's proposal on the 15th of this month, "that is, the proposal that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude a formal mutual assistance agreement," was definitive in nature. Ambassador Maisky immediately replied that the basic viewpoint of the Soviet government was to organize a collective security system, and that mutual assistance obligations were essential for success. This viewpoint would not be changed, and therefore, other suggestions besides a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union could not be accepted.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the progress of the current British-Soviet negotiations. The cabinet members present generally acknowledged that the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union was a matter of urgency, and that Britain should make concessions. It is said among people close to the government that a British-Soviet agreement is expected to be reached, and that the Soviet Union's requests can be substantially satisfied. At the same time, Britain's freedom of action with its allies in the event of war in Eastern Europe will not be restricted in any way, and the power to decide on war and peace will not be left to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Sinclair Churchill Acknowledge Soviet's Important Position</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th] Liberal Party leader Sinclair criticized the government's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal in a debate in the House of Commons today, saying, "I don't know if we can win in war without the Soviet Union, but I am certain that we cannot maintain peace without the Soviet Union." "The British proposal is not reciprocal. We must remember that Hitler is now closely watching the British-Soviet negotiations. If we want to gain the friendship of the Soviet Union and its military assistance, we must be on an equal footing with the Soviet Union, as equal partners, to jointly resist aggression."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Churchill, who participated in the House of Commons debate on foreign policy yesterday, stated that unless the Soviet Union is treated equally and can prove that the measures taken by the United Nations are effective, the Soviet Union will not be able to join any agreement. If leadership cannot be clearly defined, no one will be willing to join. The British government must recognize that without the backing of a vast and solid Soviet ally, no Eastern European country will be able to sustain a war for more than a year. Churchill continued, "We are not asking for help from the Soviet Union, but there are better proposals than those put forward by our government, which are clear and straightforward. We must not let past efforts be wasted. We sincerely hope that the government can understand the key points. If the government abandons this strong and factually necessary Soviet assistance, it will betray the people's confidence and tolerance in the government."</p>
<p>Eden Calls for Swift and Thorough Cooperation Between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Eden then expressed his opinion, stating that in his view, if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can reach an understanding, it would be a blessing for peace. The sooner the understanding between the three countries is reached, the more substantial the content, and the more lasting the effect, the greater the benefits will be. He is convinced that this move will be beneficial to Britain, the Soviet Union, Europe, and the entire path to maintaining peace. Eden then discussed the issue from the perspective of British-Soviet relations, saying that he saw no reason why British-Soviet relations could not avoid conflict. Who in the world can devote themselves to domestic construction with all their strength? What is the government's current policy aiming for? It is not to seek a way to win the war, but to seek to avoid the occurrence of war. If this is the case, the stronger the organization, the greater its effect in preventing war. Therefore, for the sake of peace in Europe, it is necessary to quickly establish complete and thorough cooperation. Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler replied on behalf of the government: "I have heard people say that if an act of aggression occurs in the Mediterranean and the cooperation of the Soviet Union cannot be obtained, Turkey will not move a single soldier, but those who make this argument have misunderstood the true meaning of Turkey's declaration." Deputy Foreign Secretary then stated that the British government has no intention of considering recognizing Germany's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia. The British government has notified the Soviet Union that the British government believes that the British policy is more suitable for the current environment. Although it is not as clear as the Soviet proposal, it is believed that it will be able to provide effective assistance to places that need assistance. At the same time, the Soviet Union's [points] have been given careful and sympathetic consideration, and negotiations between the two sides are still in progress.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th] Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler indirectly confirmed in a speech in the House of Commons today that there were obstacles in the British-Soviet negotiations. He said that the Soviet Union's recent proposal to Britain explained the advantages of the Soviet plan, but the British government replied that in the current environment, the British proposal was more [suitable]. Butler continued, "Our plan is simpler. When countries need assistance, we can provide it, and we can maintain harmonious cooperation between the countries concerned."</p>
<p>France Acknowledges That the Hope of Completing the British-Soviet Agreement Has Increased Greatly</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Chamberlain's foreign policy speech has made political circles here feel that the hope of completing the British-Soviet agreement sooner has greatly increased. Although this question has repeatedly received divergent news from London and Moscow, it is unanimously believed that there is ample room for reconciliation where the views of the two countries differ, and France occupies an important position in this reconciliation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Well-informed sources maintain an optimistic attitude towards the British-Soviet negotiations. It is said that the British side's new lectures were sent to Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday. Although the content failed to completely satisfy the Soviet Ambassador, it has made significant revisions to the Soviet viewpoint. The Soviet Union's reply in principle is expected to be sent to London tonight. It is generally hoped that after this revision, the agreement may be concluded; otherwise, British Foreign Secretary Halifax's talks here tomorrow may also help to conclude the agreement. French Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, Secretary-General Léger, and Director of Political and Commercial Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Charvériat will all participate in this important negotiation. Halifax will be accompanied by British Ambassador Phipps and British Foreign Office British-Soviet relations expert Strang. French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador Suritz this afternoon, and the Franco-Turkish agreement involving the security of the Mediterranean and the future of the Sanjak is also scheduled to be signed next week, or on May 22, the day Germany and Italy are preparing to sign an alliance. The French cabinet meeting tomorrow will make a decision on the Sanjak issue in principle. It is reported that Turkey has requested that the area be transferred to Turkey immediately. The Franco-Turkish agreement may promote the success of the British-Soviet negotiations, as Turkey believes that Soviet assistance is crucial in the event of war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] A political commentator said today, "Chamberlain hopes to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union in the near future. If it is realized, then from Germany's observation, it will only increase the Soviet Union's arrogance, just as Britain's provision of guarantees to Poland has turned Poland hardened." According to political circles, strengthening guarantees to Poland, Romania, Greece, etc. will only increase Europe's unease. The political commentator stated that Chamberlain's talk about colonial issues stated that Germany's demands for colonies were not a matter of asking for concessions, but a due right based on President Wilson's Fourteen Points. What Germany seeks has not exceeded its original colonies, and there has never been any destruction of the Fourteen Points' crude oil behavior.</p>
<h3>British Labor Congress Decides to Participate in National Defense Work Rejects Proposal for General Strike Urges Britain and the Soviet Union to Conclude an Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Although the Labor Congress severely criticized the implementation of conscription, as a result of today's special meeting, it still passed the proposal to participate in national defense work by a majority of 3,678,000 votes to 450,000 votes. 1,000 representatives from 38 trade unions attended the meeting, rejected the proposal to launch a general strike to resist conscription, and resolved that the General Federation of Trade Unions should continue to negotiate with the Ministry of Labor on wartime industrial issues, and urge the government to quickly take necessary steps to control prices, limit profits, and collect private wealth.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th] A meeting of 1,000 labor leaders passed a [resolution] urging the government to immediately conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union to establish a "genuine peace front," and hoping that the United States could cooperate.</p>
<h3>German-Italian Military Alliance to Be Signed Tomorrow Italian Foreign Minister and Army Minister Arrived in Berlin Yesterday Rumors That Three Joint Committees Will Be Established</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 20th] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano left for Berlin today with Army Minister [Pariani] for a three-day visit. Ciano will sign the German-Italian military alliance in Berlin on Monday (the German signatory will be Ribbentrop), and then meet with German leader Hitler.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 19th] Well-informed sources recently declared that the German-Italian political and military alliance agreement will be signed on the 22nd. The content stipulates the establishment of three joint committees to study, (1) military issues, (2) economic issues, (3) wartime economic issues. In addition, there is another important clause, which will stipulate the measures for Germany to use Italian labor in peacetime and wartime.</p>
<h3>Franco Delivers Radio Address Victory Parade Held in Rain Volunteer Troops Will Be Withdrawn Soon</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 19th] General Franco delivered a radio address today, calling on the people to unite, saying, "If we do not seize a sound peace policy after our army's victory, then the acquisition of victory is empty and meaningless." Political circles here also declared that Franco will meet with several diplomatic corps on Saturday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 19th] A victory parade was held here today in the rain, led by the Italian army, lasting about an hour, followed by the Spanish army, carrying a portrait of General Franco. When Franco arrived at the distant inspection platform, cabinet members, diplomatic envoys, and military officers welcomed him. The streets were full of German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish national flags. Several aircraft flew low in the sky, forming the words "Franco." When the German Condor Legion appeared in the parade, radio stations reported on the legion's achievements in the Spanish Civil War, praising them greatly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 19th] After the Spanish National Army triumphantly entered the city of Madrid today, five Italian transport ships are scheduled to depart from the port of Naples on the 20th and sail to the port of Cadiz in Spain to transport 18,000 Italian volunteer soldiers back to their country.</p>
<h3>League of Nations to Discuss Our Country's Application Fortification of the Åland Islands Also Included in the Discussion Procedure</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th] The 105th regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. The agenda only contains two political issues, one being the application submitted by China. When discussing this issue, the Administrative Council can take the opportunity to comprehensively review the situation in the Far East. The other is the issue of the fortification of the Åland Islands. Regarding this matter, Finland and Sweden have established an agreement with the signatory countries to the 1921 international convention (i.e., Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Britain, France, and Italy), and now they will request the Administrative Council to approve it. In addition, other [issues] have not been included in the agenda. The Administrative Council's Three-Country Committee (composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Sweden) will also be submitted for discussion, which is also not certain. The change in the legal status of the city, in particular, is still firmly opposed by Poland. Generally speaking, representatives from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will take advantage of the Administrative Council meeting to hold talks outside the venue, and its nature must be very important. However, because Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin is not here, Britain and the Soviet Union may not be able to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Inspects Border Defenses Again Hitler Also Expresses Observations on Inspecting Defenses</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Mussolini again inspected Italian defenses along the French border today, and Hitler also issued a communiqué from Eppingen tonight, describing his observations on inspecting western defenses for the past six days. Hitler claimed that he believed that the defenses there were absolutely solid. According to news from Berlin, the Germans were quite resentful that Hitler's inspection had not been fully publicized abroad. According to an explanation from a German newspaper, British policy is most afraid of discussing German national defense issues, which is why this happened.</p>
<h3>German-Lithuanian Trade Agreement to Be Signed in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] Negotiations between the German authorities and the Lithuanian commercial delegation have now reached an agreement. The Lithuanian Foreign Minister will arrive here today to sign the agreement. It is reported that Germany will obtain 30% of Lithuania's total foreign trade.</p>
<h3>German Naval Commander-in-Chief Speaks to Youth League</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Brunswick, Germany, 19th] German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder told the German Youth League today, "Our country must possess powerful battleships, so it can win in war and defend its superiority at sea. All wars are determined by naval power."</p>
<h3>Procedures for Visiting the United States Have Been Drafted British King Arrives in Ottawa Delivers Speech at Parliament Accepts Credentials Presented by the American Envoy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] The State Department recently announced that the procedures for the British King and Queen's visit to the United States have been [finalized]. When someone asked whether the aunt of the Duchess of Windsor, Mrs. Bessie (Mrs. Manley Lehman), who is now in Washington, would be invited to participate in the welcome banquet, officials refused to answer this question.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 19th] It was announced here that when the British King's train arrives, the entire city will prepare a warm welcome. The streets are lined with a large number of neatly arranged army and air force personnel. It is reported that the British Queen accepted an ivory model last night at the Mount Royal banquet (engraved with a portrait of the princess) as a souvenir to take back from Mount Royal. When the royal car arrived, the British King stepped out of the car and reviewed the guard of honor. 6,000 people cheered enthusiastically. Lord Tweedsmuir and his wife were at the station to greet him, and a 21-gun salute was fired at the same time to pay tribute. Then, they drove to the Government House to meet with members of the diplomatic corps. When the British King arrived, it was raining heavily, and the people stood in the streets for two hours in the rain. Afterwards, the weather cleared up. The road from the station to the Government House was full of flags, dazzlingly beautiful. Thousands of young people stood by the roadside, waving British flags. The British Queen wore a light purple dress and a gray hat with ostrich feathers. The British King wore the uniform of a Field Marshal. The British King and Queen visited the Canadian Parliament this afternoon, and met with reporters in the Government House in the evening. The British King signed several bills in Parliament and delivered a speech to both houses, saying, "The late King said during the Silver Jubilee that the unity of the British Empire does not lie in the British Council possessing supreme power, but in the free union of the various nations within the Empire, accepting common political principles, common ideals of peace and freedom, united and loyal to the royal family. I deeply hope that this visit to Canada can promote greater unity among the Canadian people. I also hope that the visit to the United States can enhance the friendly relations between Britain and the United States. My visit abroad is enough to show that the spirit of our nation lies in friendship with all nations, whether they are of the same race or different races. Britain is willing to maintain friendly and harmonious relations with them." The British King also accepted the credentials presented by the new American envoy to Canada, Robert, at the Government House.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 20th] The British King and Queen met with about 80 reporters and several Ottawa parliamentary reporters at the Government House last night. The British King is officially spending his birthday in the territory of the Dominion for the first time, which is a historical first. All parts of Canada have declared today as a holiday. Special celebration programs include a review of the Canadian Guard and a celebratory banquet held at the Government House. The British Queen will preside over the groundbreaking ceremony of the Ottawa High Court today. Afterwards, the British King and Queen will cross the river to visit Hull and dine with Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who will host a banquet for the British King and Queen at the Chateau Laurier Hotel tonight.</p>
<h3>Regarding Talent Registration</h3>
<p>Local newspapers have been running an eye-catching advertisement for the past few days:</p>
<p>Chinese Talent Registration Begins!</p>
<p>Chinese, Register Quickly!</p>
<p>Defend the Land and Defend Yourself!</p>
<p>Today’s newspapers also carry a news item that says:</p>
<p>Relief for Unemployed Mechanics in Guangzhou!</p>
<p>Central Government Sends Personnel to Hong Kong to Investigate and Consider Employment!</p>
<p>Over Three Hundred Mechanics in Hong Kong Participate in Talent Registration!</p>
<p>Seeing this advertisement and news item, I feel that there are many things I should discuss with my readers: After the British talent registration, the Hong Kong government continued to organize automatic registration of Chinese talent entirely because of the severity of the current situation, urgently needing to mobilize talent to defend the local area. Its intention is extremely pure and appropriate. Many of our compatriots residing in Hong Kong have participated in the First World War and contributed significantly to the Allied countries. Although that war should not have been participated in, the heroism and righteousness of the Chinese people were admired by the world. The crisis of another major war is now imminent, and we must solemnly recognize the meaning of future wars, resolutely oppose fascist aggressors to maintain peace and justice. Friendly nation Britain has recently been working hard in the anti-aggression movement. We should give enthusiastic support to this appeal from the Hong Kong government, promote the great spirit of overseas Chinese in the past, and prepare to fight for the protection of the local area, the protection of peace, and the progress of human culture. What we should pay attention to at the same time is that the promotion and treatment after talent registration should be completely equal to that of the British.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the central government sending personnel to Hong Kong to investigate unemployed mechanics, we feel that we should pay even more attention. First, because our country's war of resistance has entered a new and critical stage, we need talent everywhere to work together to overcome difficulties and strive for victory, and what is expected of overseas compatriots is particularly urgent. Second, since the war of resistance, not to mention the sacrifices of various talents in the country, those who have been displaced to various places and even overseas are in urgent need of relief. It is truly a great thing that the central government can pay attention to this at present, and our various overseas Chinese communities should strongly support and assist its implementation. However, at the same time, we should also pay attention to the fact that the talents needed by the motherland at present are extremely extensive, not only urgently needing technical talents who can contribute to production and construction undertakings, but also urgently needing specialized talents in military affairs, politics, culture, and diplomacy; and among the compatriots currently stranded overseas, there is no shortage of such talents. Therefore, we hope to quickly organize a talent registration with a broader scope and more detailed plans, and after appropriate testing, organization, and training, separately promote them to work in various departments. This matter cannot rely solely on the central government, and we hope that overseas Chinese groups and enthusiastic social leaders from all walks of life will come forward to cooperate.</p>
<p>The times are critical and the situation is pressing. May our compatriots from all walks of life encourage each other!</p>

<h3>China Salvation Drama Troupe Receives Guests from All Walks of Life Yesterday to Report on Overseas Propaganda Mission; Enhancing the National Salvation Sentiment of Overseas Compatriots; Using the Reality of the War of Resistance as International Propaganda</h3>
<p>In order to enhance the national salvation sentiment of overseas compatriots and expand the international aid-China movement, the China Salvation Drama Troupe will soon go abroad to promote in the Nanyang, Philippines, and American areas. Passing through Hong Kong, at the request of the Hong Kong Federation of Relief Associations, they will make a short stay to hold charity performances to raise funds for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees, which will be held at the Lee Theatre on the 25th of this month. In order to enable people from all walks of life in Hong Kong to understand the mission and significance of this overseas trip, the troupe specially held a tea party at the Astor Hotel on the second floor yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, inviting celebrities from all walks of life in Hong Kong and comrades from the cultural and drama circles to report on the overseas propaganda mission. Invitations were sent to various groups and celebrities to participate. Although the weather was unfavorable that day, with heavy rain pouring down, the attendees were very enthusiastic. It is estimated that there were over two hundred people, including Song Dazhang, representing Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng, as well as Zhang Zhaotang, Chen Binhe, Ouyang Yuqian, Li Jianfeng, Lu Guomian, Liu Qingxuan, Mrs. Chen Youxuan, Chen Tieyi, Li Meng, representatives from major social organizations, editors from various newspapers, reporters from various news agencies, and principals from various schools, gathering together, creating a grand occasion. The atmosphere was exceptionally lively and harmonious. First, Jin Shan, the head of the troupe, delivered a speech, reporting on the troupe's past work and the purpose and mission of this overseas propaganda trip. Jin first stated that the national cultural circles mobilized after July 7th and August 13th, organized the Drama Circle National Salvation Association, and formed fifteen national salvation performance troupes, which went to various war zones to carry out propaganda work. This troupe was the second troupe, which left Shanghai in August the year before last and went to Suzhou, Nanjing, Anhui, Hebei, Hunan, Guangxi and other places to do various national salvation work for a period of twenty months. Recently, in order to expand propaganda, there was the motivation to go overseas for propaganda. He continued to state that the purpose of this overseas trip was because overseas compatriots are far away from the motherland and it is not easy to understand the real situation of the motherland's war of resistance. Therefore, this overseas trip is on the one hand to fulfill their own responsibilities, and on the other hand to convey to the overseas compatriots the various atrocities that the troupe has seen in the past twenty months, and how bravely the soldiers on the front lines are fighting to defend the country, and how the people in the rear are shouldering their responsibilities during the war of resistance. In addition to expressing it through drama, they will also use various methods to promote to the overseas compatriots, so that the overseas compatriots have a deep understanding of the situation of the motherland's war of resistance, so as to give more help to the country. Jin finally stated that the troupe will first go to Nanyang, the Philippines, Singapore, and other areas, and then to Honolulu, San Francisco, and other areas. At the same time, they will also promote the war of resistance photos and war trophies to the international community. Finally, Song Dazhang, representative of Wu Tiecheng, Li Jian of the Press Association, Zhang Zhaotang, President of Guangxi Bank, Ouyang Yuqian, a pioneer in drama, Chen Tieyi of the Education Federation, General Chen Xiangyuan, and Lu Guomian of Zhong Sheng Charity Society, delivered speeches, giving much praise and encouragement. The meeting ended happily at 6:00 PM. (Please refer to today's newspaper's film and drama weekly feature)</p>

<h3>Attention, South China Film Industry! Strictly Guard Against XX's Silver Conspiracy; XX Actively Running Around in South China After Failure in Shanghai; A Certain Theater and Film Company Are Even Considering Willingly Being Bought Out</h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Good films are the vanguard of culture, while bad films are the vanguard of destroying culture. Mr. Jiang Baili has a few famous sayings in military affairs: "If living conditions are compatible with fighting conditions, then victory; if they are separate, then defeat; if they are opposite, then death." Since the War of Resistance, it is not difficult to estimate how much work in the South China film industry has been coordinated with the War of Resistance, how much work has been separated from the War of Resistance, and even opposed to the War of Resistance. And XX's plot against us is meticulous, never letting up. Their attack on the Shanghai film industry has already revealed some behind-the-scenes activities. Recently, they have been actively running around in South China, trying to attack from this weakness. It is said that a certain theater is likely to be bought out, and a folk tale film produced by a certain company is also trying to supply the occupied areas in large quantities. If our work is separated from the conditions of the War of Resistance or opposed to it, it may not be impossible to remedy. If our work is even coordinated with XX's aggressive steps, then the crime will be unforgivable, and the serious consequences will be unpredictable. I hope the South China film industry will strictly guard against XX's conspiracy, and not be tempted by profit, earning bloody money by selling out national interests, causing pain to the present and joy to the enemy—for the sake of the war of resistance supported by the sacrifice of the heads of millions of compatriots, the displacement of millions of people, and the efforts of millions of people running around calling for help, and for the sake of the freedom of your own descendants for generations to come, we must loudly cry out! "Merchants, take back your greedy hands!"</p>
<h3>Fellow Townsmen from Guangdong and Guangxi in Shanghai Donate 10,000 Yuan for Disaster Relief in Guangxi; Remitted Through Guangxi Bank</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zhang Zhaorong of the Hong Kong branch of Guangxi Bank received HK$200 donated to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance by the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Support Association of Vancouver, Canada, and HK$200 for the comfort of Generals Li and Bai. Mr. Zhang immediately accepted and forwarded them. It can be seen that the overseas Chinese community in Canada is donating large sums of money back to the country, which shows the patriotic enthusiasm of the local people. In addition, the Hong Kong office of the Guangdong and Guangxi Fellow Townsmen's Relief Committee for Refugees in Shanghai, in view of the urgent need for relief for refugees, donated 10,000 yuan to be used for the relief of refugees in Guangxi. It was also remitted free of charge by Mr. Zhang to Chairman Huang of the Guangxi Provincial Government for receipt and forwarding.</p>

The meeting adjourned at half past five in the afternoon. Many relatives and friends of Dr. Shang sent elegiac addresses and funeral orations. Wu Tiecheng, a member of the Central Committee, and Liao Chengzhi, a representative of the Eighth Route Army, both sent wreaths. The famous reporter Snow personally attended the memorial service and offered condolences to Mrs. Shang after the meeting. The wife wiped away tears and talked with Mr. Snow, and expressed her gratitude. It is noted that Dr. Shang sacrificed himself for the country this time, and his family is poor and his orphans are young.

<h3>Preparing to Cope with the Current Environment; Hong Kong Volunteer Force Expands; General Garsia Speaks, British Position Is Extremely Serious; Hong Kong Must Work Hard to Prepare, Hoping for Participation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps held its annual dinner and shooting awards ceremony yesterday (the 19th). Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote of Hong Kong attended the meeting to present the awards. Participants included Commander-in-Chief General Garsia, Volunteer Force Commander Law Si, Lo Man Kam, Duo Wei Lu, and Liao Yali. Approximately 360 military, political, business, and gentry figures attended. During the meeting, Volunteer Force Commander Law Si reported on the general situation of military affairs last year, stating briefly that under the guidance of the Governor of Hong Kong, and with the enthusiastic cooperation of the army, navy, and air force, the exercises in various camps achieved satisfactory and excellent results. Recently, in order to adapt to the environment, the military quota has been expanded, and it is hoped that all sectors of Hong Kong will make efforts to participate. As for the current headquarters and barracks being insufficient, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army has been keenly aware of the urgent needs of the military and has agreed to find a way to solve this problem. After the speech, Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Garsia delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, saying briefly that the environment in which the British Empire finds itself is extremely serious. The speaker believes that even the most optimistic among us cannot deny this. Regardless of the international situation, we should strive to prepare to cope with the advent of adverse situations. We must know that striving to prepare is our responsibility. In times of emergency, the responsibilities of the Volunteer Force are extremely important. Therefore, it is hoped that the people of Hong Kong can actively participate in the Volunteer Force service, so that the status of Hong Kong can be further strengthened.

<p>Yesterday, there was torrential rain, the fourth time since spring. All the reservoirs in Hong Kong have received a large amount of water. According to the report of the Observatory yesterday afternoon, a total of two inches, seven tenths and five hundredths of an inch of rain were received within 24 hours from 10:00 AM the day before yesterday to 10:00 AM yesterday. Also, from 10:00 AM yesterday to</p>
<h3>Torrential Rain Yesterday; Water Shortage May Be Resolved; Landslide Near Tai Po Road</h3>
<p>Until 7:00 PM, a total of one and a half inches of rain were received. If there is continued rain, the drinking water problem can be completely solved. It is noted that yesterday, the low-lying streets in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon were flooded by rainwater. At 6:00 PM yesterday, the hillside near 5.5 miles of Tai Po Road suddenly collapsed due to the influence of rainwater, blocking the road. Judging from the situation, it seems that there is a risk of continued collapse. The Public Works Department sent personnel to organize and warned passing vehicles and pedestrians to pay attention to avoid danger.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong's Rats!</h3>
<p>— Waiting</p>
<p>Breeding Quantity, Even More Than People!</p>
<p>When working in the newspaper office, I worked at night, and I couldn’t rest until after 2:00 AM. At that time, everyone was in a warm bed, dreaming good dreams, and the earth was as silent as death; the rats took this opportunity to come out and move around, looking for their food. Under the walls and floors were simply their "dormitories," and sofas and some valuable furniture were just their "sports grounds." They marched out in formation, coming and going, running east and west. They couldn’t steal cooked food, but they could also fill their stomachs with raw fruits. If they entered your bedroom, because they couldn’t find food, they would become extremely fierce and scream incessantly. These harsh, strange noises would startle even the soundest sleepers. Sometimes they even used the power of the group to overturn vases and drink water, knocking down soap and eating it; if you sewed a new piece of clothing, and didn’t hang it properly in the kitchen, and they unfortunately discovered the starch residue left by the garment maker, in order to eat the starch, your clothes wouldn’t even wait until tomorrow, and would have several large holes. Rats are completely destructive to humans, so people also deeply hate rats, wishing they could eradicate them completely—but we who work at night, although we clearly see them running rampant, are simply too busy to fight them when our work is most intense.</p>
<p>Rats not only disturb our good dreams and destroy our objects, but also spread infectious diseases. "Plague" is an infectious disease that is brought to mankind thanks to them. The popular "Black Death" is also transmitted by fleas on the rats. Patients develop a fever, develop nuclei in their bodies, and after death, their bodies develop black spots. Doctors are often helpless in the face of this.</p>
<p>Although rats exist everywhere and are not a unique product of Hong Kong, Hong Kong rats seem to be particularly numerous. Originally, rats have a very high reproductive capacity. Small rats can produce offspring after 100 days, and there are four litters a year, with five to ten offspring per litter. Calculating this way, the numbers are staggering; probably because Hong Kong's rat extermination work is not sufficient, they can continue to produce and reproduce. According to the statistics of the Cleaning Bureau, in the eight years from 1930 to 1938, a total of 1.5 million rats were killed in Hong Kong and Kowloon, an average of about 200,000 per year. Is this a good result for rat extermination? But according to experts' estimates, each pair of rats can produce 1,200 small rats in twelve months. Although Hong Kong's population has suddenly increased, it is believed that the number of rats is two to three times the number of people. This is how alarming it is! As for the property losses caused by the rats' "rampage" in Hong Kong, they have also been statistically analyzed. It is said that it reaches 2 million yuan every year, which is almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>The epidemics spread by rats in Hong Kong have also been very harmful. The great epidemic of 1894 was a gift from rats. It is heard that the epidemic first occurred in Yunnan, then spread to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to India and various parts of the Far East. The mortality rate of this epidemic was 100,000 in Guangzhou, 5,000 in Hong Kong, and over 10 million in India. From 1930 to the present, plague has rarely been found in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Although raising cats can catch rats, we also feel that dealing with cats is quite difficult; trapping rats with cages is actually difficult to succeed, and occasional success is just a fluke. In the United States, France, Russia, and England, there are "rat extermination companies." These companies specialize in catching and killing rats for people and eliminating disasters. Hong Kong does not yet have this kind of equipment, and to this day still mostly relies on cats to kill rats. Speaking of rat extermination, there is a joke in Hong Kong. It is said that once, the Hong Kong government, because rats were too rampant, promulgated a reward policy to kill rats. For every rat killed, the government would buy the corpse of the dead rat from him for five cents. This reward policy was indeed very effective. Every day, people taking dead rats to exchange for money was very enthusiastic, and the stream was endless. The results were quite remarkable. Later, it was discovered that many were transported from Guangzhou and Macau. Originally, they were using this reward policy to make money. Therefore, the Hong Kong government also stopped buying.</p>
<p>The most effective way to kill rats is to use poisonous rodenticides. The latest rodenticide is "Latin." The method is to inject "Latin" into bread, rice, wheat, wood, and cloth, and place it in places where rats must pass, allowing rats to steal and eat it. When the rats eat the poisoned food, the toxicity will take effect, and the rats' bodies will immediately become strong and hot, and they will die from it. It is a pity that no one in Hong Kong is using this method yet!</p>

<h3>On Ouyang Yuqian</h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>Respectfully Saluting a Fighter Who Has Strived for Thirty Years in the Theater Movement</p>
<p>Not long after the centenary celebration for Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a venerable elder, theatrical figures in Hong Kong again gathered to celebrate Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's fiftieth birthday. To this theatrical giant, for his thirty years of effort in continuously adding new members to the history of Chinese spoken drama, we, the theater workers, should offer our boundless respect.</p>
<p>Here, we need to understand his life and thoughts. Only in this way can we understand the process of his work, understand the characteristics of his works, and discover the keynote of several periods of the Chinese theater movement through his career.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian was born in the twenty-second year before the founding of the Republic of China (i.e., the fifteenth year of Guangxu, Ji Chou year). His hometown is Liuyang, Hunan. His grandfather was a famous scholar, and both Tan Sitong and Tang Caichang were his students. Yuqian went to Japan to study at the age of fifteen. He returned to China in the fifth year before the founding of the Republic of China (Bing Wu year) and married Ms. Liu Yunqiu. After the marriage, he went to Japan again, initially studying politics, then turning to literature and art. He returned to China in the Xinhai year. Regarding his theatrical life in Japan and after returning to China, Ouyang has described it in detail in his book "Since I Started Acting," in ten chapters: "The Opening in the Spring Willow Theater," "The Shenyou Society," "The Tongzhi Society," "The Social Education Group," "The Wen Society," "The Spring Willow Theater," "The Period of Being a Professional Actor," "Living in Nantong for Three Years," "The Experience of the National Theater," and "The Experience of the Guangdong Drama Research Institute." The harvest from his work in Nanjing from 1927 and in Guangdong after 1929 was extremely rich. At the end of 1930, he went to Shanghai to establish the "Great Era Society." After the January 28th Incident, he went abroad, staying in France and the Soviet Union for the longest time, visiting various theaters and troupes, and reading famous dramas from various countries extensively. He returned to China in 1933, went to Fujian for a period, and then went to Japan again. After returning to China, he served as a screenwriter and director at Xinhua Company, Star Company, and Lianhua Company. After the July 7th Incident, he participated in the Shanghai literary salvation movement, sparing no effort in forming acting troupes, organizing former war actors, and participating in the united front work. After that, he went to Guangxi via Hong Kong, where he directed for the National Defense Art Society and the 21 Drama Society. He arrived in Hong Kong in the summer of 1938 and has been there ever since.</p>
<p>Looking back on these thirty years of theatrical activity, we can conclude that he is forever a traitor to the old society or oppressors. His work has never stopped, nor has it ever remained at one stage. He is an artist with many talents. Last but certainly not least, he is constantly learning, constantly working, and constantly educating.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>From the plays and films he has created, we can see how he grasps and absorbs the rapidly advancing Chinese culture, and how he participates in the creation. Below is a not-so-complete list:</p>

<p>In these plays, there is no remarkable sermon, nor is there any startling plot. What he has are reasonable and realistic plots, reality anytime and anywhere, the development of images suitable for the masses, and seamless, sharply satirical dialogues. What is especially overflowing between the lines and beyond the words is a sense of resistance and justice.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Mr. Yuqian received revolutionary baptism very early. When he was in Japan, the Tongmenghui was in its active period. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the strong oppression of the warlords also directly affected him. From 1927 to 1935, he constantly felt the disunity of domestic politics and the pain inflicted by the invaders. Therefore, fundamentally, he is a supporter of the united front with a correct worldview.</p>
<p>In terms of theater and film, since 1929, he has been advocating the slogan of "theater suitable for the times and for the people." In the unfolding of the anti-Japanese theater movement, he advocated that "theater should practice sinicization and popularization," advocated "improving artistic standards," and advocated that "theater workers should not be overwhelmed by passion and forget that theatrical art needs cultivation."</p>
<p>Naturally, these are suggestions and supplements to the theory and practice of the anti-Japanese theater movement, rather than a complete rejection of a certain theory.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Mr. Yuqian can be said to be a multi-talented artist, almost an all-around theater worker. He understands philosophy, understands politics, is good at poetry, understands music, and he can write scripts, direct, perform, and design stage settings. He knows English and Japanese, and also has some foundation in French and Soviet languages. Among the Chinese, he is indeed a rare giant.</p>
<p>He is mainly a good director, secondly a playwright, and then a theorist who doesn't like to speak out; he is not a very successful manager and organizer, and a very poor politician—he can't promote, can't flaunt, can't handle things quickly, and is too inflexible.</p>
<p>This is the reason for his achievements, but it is also the reason why his work cannot fully realize its effectiveness and be understood unanimously.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>What theater workers need to learn from Mr. Ouyang today is the spirit of continuous learning, continuous working, and continuous salvation that has lasted for decades. And his courage to resist and fight, "unmoved by wealth and unyielding to force," learn from his in-depth and simple popularization, the diverse ways of writing Chinese plays, and the service attitude of not competing for fame or gain.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are also many areas where young workers need to build new records with a spirit of blitzkrieg to supplement and expand the work of the elderly Mr. Ouyang, so that the anti-Japanese theater movement can achieve a higher degree of development, that is:</p>
<p>(1) Strengthen the belief that the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built, so that the theater can truly mobilize the masses and accelerate the victory of national liberation;</p>
<p>(2) Establish a steel-like team of young theater cadres, collectively study and work, enrich and expand the united front of the national theater community;</p>
<p>(3) Carry out a script creation movement, to organically unify content and form, to be powerful and representative of the new China;</p>
<p>(4) Improve acting skills and stage technology standards; practice the expansion of the theater field;</p>
<p>(5) The organic and consistent development of work ability, work line, work method, and work attitude.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is not old yet. He is full of youth and vitality in work and learning. This article is not a settlement but an introduction to greater action. We can predict—when Mr. Yuqian is as old as Mr. Ma Xiangbo, we will have a richer review!</p>

<h3>Special Report on the China Salvation Troupe Reception</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>The China Salvation Troupe, which has been galloped through the northern and southern battlefields for twenty months and loved by millions of soldiers and civilians, has been in Hong Kong for more than a month. Time slipped away before the eyes of the workers, like lightning. In the past fifty days, inspired by the "perseverance" and "enthusiasm" of the China Salvation Troupe friends, a climax of "welcome," "reunion," speeches, "forums," and "flag presentation" has been set off everywhere like a torrent. The friends of the China Salvation Troupe, in order to sincerely thank the kindness of all walks of life and to exchange work opinions, held a grand gathering at the Sihao Hotel yesterday.</p>
<p>It had been raining all day, but the rain could not stop their meeting. It was also because of the rain that the sincere response was shown even more, forming a hot exchange. Leaders from all walks of life in Hong Kong and representatives from various social organizations and institutions ran in one after another, shaking their bodies, and the rainwater on their clothes splashed directly onto the floor. Raincoats and umbrellas slowly gathered together, men's wear, women's wear, gorgeous, simple, all kinds of styles, everything, a strange and interesting "rain gear exhibition." When meeting, the first thing to say was the trilogy of "waiting for the rain," "sheltering from the rain," and "braving the rain." The friends of the China Salvation Troupe were too busy to attend to everyone, repeatedly saying "Sorry! Sorry!" Groups of three or five were taught to cloth the huge auditorium, speaking freely.</p>
<p>When the pointer of time reached four o'clock, more than a hundred people sat down neatly in a horizontal row in the front and two vertical rows in the middle.</p>
<p>In a burst of warm applause, Mr. Jin Shan, the head of the "China Salvation Troupe," stood up. First, on behalf of the "China Salvation Troupe," he expressed his sincere gratitude to the guests who attended in the rain today. Then he talked about their work process in the war zone in the past twenty months. He said: "In the past 20 months, in the war zone, we have lived closely with the heroic soldiers and simple compatriots, and worked with a learning attitude. Now, I can say that we understand the motherland in the war. We recognize the motherland and deeply know that the future of the motherland is bright, and there is no precedent in history."</p>
<p>"However, the overseas Chinese who reside abroad, because of the special nature of the region, I believe that some overseas Chinese inevitably have a blurred understanding of the motherland, especially in the current stage of the anti-Japanese war after the fall of Wuhan, especially today when the × bandits and traitors are spreading rumors, sabotaging, and falsely accusing, the task of our delegation to go abroad is to promote these points to the overseas Chinese, so that they can further participate in the great cause of anti-Japanese war and national construction, so that the overseas Chinese can understand that the victorious motherland will change their difficult status overseas, and will not erase the merits of every citizen in the struggle of hardship and difficulty."</p>
<p>"At the same time, based on our work experience in the war zone, the medical, reception, and transportation problems of the wounded soldiers, the problem of cultural food in the war zone, and the livelihood problems of disabled soldiers, the families of soldiers who went on expeditions, and the families of fallen soldiers, make us feel that it is necessary to solve them as much as possible. Another task of our delegation to go abroad is to raise 500,000 donations to establish wounded soldier reception stations and wounded soldier hospitals. Since the war of resistance, the enthusiastic situation of overseas Chinese transporting materials and strength is known to every compatriot. The millions of donations they sent to the motherland are the cornerstone of national construction and the power of the anti-Japanese war. I believe that overseas Chinese who love the motherland will help us to complete this work."</p>
<p>"However, this task is too heavy, and we are too insufficient. Soon, we will have to pick up this major burden and leave Hong Kong. Before leaving this place, we earnestly hope that all gentlemen and friends will give us guidance in many ways. One valuable opinion from everyone can reduce our difficulties by ten points. In order to get more guidance, I don't want to drag my words too long, and at the same time avoid wasting too much of your valuable time."</p>
<p>Enthusiastic and sincere, Mr. Jin Shan is not only a serious salvation worker, but also an inspiring speaker. This is an excellent talent trained by the times. Everyone ate tea and snacks while listening to the speech:</p>
<p>The first guest speaker was Mr. Wu Tiecheng, member of the Central Committee, representing Mr. Song Dazhang, who praised the China Salvation Troupe. Li Jianfeng, representative of the Press Association, said that it is the glory of the cultural world for the China Salvation Troupe to serve the front line and comfort the overseas Chinese. It shows that our youth is not decadent or sluggish, and it is also the glory of the Chinese nation. Secondly, he said that he was entrusted by the Charity Federation of all walks of life to co-organize this charity performance of the China Salvation Troupe. For art and for meaning, it is worth everyone's enthusiastic appreciation.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhaotang said: Drama is the best tool for propaganda. In the past, dramas that performed Yue Fei were very popular, and those that performed Qin Hui were hated, scolded, and beaten by the audience, which shows the greatness of the power of drama. Today's drama is much more advanced than before, and the effect is even more profound.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, a pioneer in the theater world, said; When the China Salvation Troupe arrived in Hong Kong, all walks of life welcomed them warmly, and the mission to go overseas is very important, and it will surely be welcomed by the vast number of overseas Chinese. When the China Salvation Troupe was first established, Mr. Ouyang was also in Shanghai. He still remembers the situation when he sent them off at that time. We were deeply moved when we heard it. He said that now seeing Jin Shan is like seeing a long-lost friend, very excited and very happy. The work of the China Salvation Troupe is multi-faceted, and drama is only an important tool. Their progress is tempered from the front line, and this is also a new development in Chinese drama. The theater community in Zou City really feels very ashamed!</p>
<p>Now, the war of resistance is difficult, and it will be difficult to build the country in the future with scars all over. The task of the China Salvation Troupe is for the war of resistance and also for the construction of the country. We all have the same important task. To welcome the China Salvation Troupe, we must meet in work.</p>
<p>——This passage was particularly kind and meaningful when Mr. Ouyang said it, and a burst of warm applause was woven together.</p>
<p>After several other guests spoke, Mr. Lin Shu, the head of the Guangxi Student Army Regiment who went abroad with the China Salvation Troupe, reported on the experience of participating in the war of resistance on the front line, and the atmosphere in the whole venue became particularly tense. He said how to fight under the artillery and airplane bombs, and the strong morale, the great power of the youth and the masses, and the vivid heroic deeds made people feel very excited. Mr. Lin's last paragraph was especially moving: "Mr. Jin Shan said that I am helping the China Salvation Troupe to promote, which is very rare. In fact, it is very rare for me to learn from the young friends of the China Salvation Troupe. When Director Jin Shan was directing, he was full of sweat, which moved me very much. Now, I don't know how to act, but I also play a small role. I hope to perform better in the future for everyone to see." Warm applause was drawn a lot, and everyone laughed and sent off Mr. Lin first. to come.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Shan gave the final conclusion: "We are the sentinels sent by everyone. We have experienced and understood that the war of resistance will surely be victorious. We ourselves feel that our cultivation is not enough, but there are two words that we can definitely do, that is "sincerity." We will never retreat even if we shed the last drop of blood. I hope you will give us sentinels orders and whips. We must repay your expectations with work. Now, on behalf of all the members of the China Salvation Troupe, I salute you. Goodbye"!</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Re-performance of "Huanghuagang"</h3>
<p>— Ying Zhong</p>
<p>The emerging theater movement in China has shown its sharpness and fighting spirit even more because of the full-scale unfolding of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Theater workers in Hong Kong have also given full play to the propaganda effect of theatrical art according to the needs of the environment, leading the masses to participate in the ranks of the War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<p>"Huanghuagang," this great historical revolutionary drama, was performed under this meaning. This is a rare great action in the history of the Hong Kong theater movement. Its power and the magnitude of its response are unparalleled, especially in consolidating and developing the theater movement in Hong Kong, it has made a great contribution to the promotion task. Now, it is being re-performed under the auspices of the Hong Kong Charity Federation of all walks of life. This performance bears two major roles: in addition to raising money to comfort the families of the soldiers who died on the front line, just like the first performance, it is also to celebrate the fiftieth birthday of Mr. Ouyang Yuqi, the most advanced mentor of our theater workers.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian has made many contributions to the emerging theater movement in China. He opened up a way to improve the old opera, and he led the emerging theater movement. From decades ago to the present, he has always stood firmly on the position of theater.</p>
<p>In the establishment period of the Chinese theater movement in the past ten years, because of the obstruction of the environment, I don't know how many theater workers left their positions and gave up this great work, but our Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is still fighting hard in the difficulties as he has been for decades!</p>
<p>In the current stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, theater has certainly played a great role, but many theater workers have obliterated the in-depth work that theater should have in art, and only picked up its propaganda side. In fact, the essence of theatrical art will help its propaganda role. If this point is obliterated, it will inevitably flow into vulgarity. Naturally, we cannot ask every theater worker to take care of both sides at such a critical time, but this arduous work must be shouldered by someone, and Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is still leading us all the way to that road full of brilliance.</p>
<p>My theater workers, with the greatest enthusiasm, to bless Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's fiftieth birthday? It is a deep meaning and role with infinite importance.</p>
<h3>Wish Mr. Ouyang Always Young!</h3>
<p>— Ling Ke</p>
<p>What kind of person is Mr. Ouyang Yuqian? Why is it worthy of our theater workers to celebrate? Naturally, I believe that our theater workers already know clearly—Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is the pioneer of our Chinese emerging theater—he spread this emerging theater art to the wilderness of the motherland thirty years ago. At the same time, in these thirty long years, he has experienced all kinds of hardships, appearing as a petrel in the storm, and unyieldingly cultivating and irrigating... He has never left his position, and has never given up the revolutionary task of the emerging theater tradition; it can be said that Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's theater work history is an important chapter in the history of the Chinese emerging theater movement, and the glorious record of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's theater work is also the main nourishment for the flowers opened by Chinese theater today; all this is enough for our theater workers to celebrate enthusiastically!</p>
<p>Besides being worthy of our enthusiastic celebration in principle. I think: Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's constant learning, constant work, standing in front of the great era at all times, and brave fighting, this spirit is the example for theater workers, and it is what we should learn and promote.</p>
<p>At the same time, today. The national self-defense war of resistance has reached a more serious stage, and some wavering elements who do not have firm faith in the country and the nation have successively appeared and defected from the motherland to the × bandits' camp, or left their positions and stopped fighting, and Mr. Ouyang answered us in action, he contributed all his strength to serve the war of resistance. "Pine and cypress are known in the cold winter," and "strong grass is known in the fierce wind." Now that the Chinese people are in this critical time, Mr. Moyang, who is fifty years old, is still as loyal as ever to save the nation from danger. It is by no means meaningless for us to celebrate the birthday of such a fighter.</p>
<p>Finally, I celebrate: Mr. Ouyang's working spirit will always be young!</p>

<h3>Introduction to "Paradise in a Lonely Island," the First Film by Da Di Film Company</h3>
<p>— Qing Yun</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's First New Work After Coming South</p>
<p>After the sudden outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in the motherland entered a prolonged state, and after Shanghai and Hong Kong successively became isolated islands, the Shanghai film industry, which had been caught off guard and became rigid, was resurrected, while the Hong Kong film industry flourished in an abnormal and almost insane manner. This distorted phenomenon plunged the entire film industry into a state of turmoil. Fortunately, there were still a few workers who were neither threatened by power nor lured by profit, and who firmly defended their film posts in the harsh environment. As proven by their actual actions, we should say that our progressive director, Mr. Cai Chusheng, is one of those who stood their ground. We should not so much honor such responsible workers as brave fighters, but rather call them "hardworking soldiers."</p>
<p>In a time when some directors could produce thirty or forty films, he was still working on the script for "Storms in the South China Sea"—collecting, selecting, and processing his script materials. He was determined to—rather not realize it than realize it carelessly. And Da Di Film Company, which invited Mr. Cai Chusheng to direct this film, also holds the same goal.</p>
<p>Because they needed to wait for the right time to shoot "Storms in the South China Sea," several months ago, he decided to first shoot "Paradise in a Lonely Island," originally by Mr. Zhao Yingfang. After two or three months of hard work, he completed the screenplay and prepared everything. Thus, "Paradise in a Lonely Island" began its work on the set. In recent days, working through the night, through the night, through the night, it is being filmed under intense pressure. Everyone involved in the work is putting in all their effort.</p>
<p>Although this film is called "Paradise in a Lonely Island," it strips off the outer garment of paradise that "the isolated island" wears, and sees through the inner layer of the isolated island. From here, it dissects a group of characters who have been tested by "the War of Resistance"—this great touchstone, and from this group of characters, it sees a microcosm of the War of Resistance, expressing its absolute significance.</p>
<p>The characters it includes are: a northern dancer, a mysterious young man, a young lady from the mainland, a playboy from Shanghai, a bartender who gives injections to relieve pain, a young lady frightened by the artillery fire, gangster henchmen, a miserable woman, a group of children selling newspapers... The people who play these roles are Lili Li and Hong Hong, who came from afar, Li Qing, who would rather starve than make poisonous movies, Bai Lu, who has been away for a long time, Jiang Junchao, and the actors from the China Art Troupe, such as Tong Ru, Yang Wei, Ge Xin, Jiang Ming, Li Hua, Li Jingbo, Lan Ma, Zhang Lide... Audiences in various places have long had a very clear understanding of them on the screen and on the stage.</p>
<p>Because film is not only a comprehensive art, but also a comprehensive science and technology—sound, light, electricity, and chemistry are all sophisticated parts that make up a film, so the quality of the technology often determines the beauty or ugliness of the artistic value of a film. Although Da Di Company was established through pioneering in difficult and arduous conditions, it does not want to be careless in the slightest about this point. The reporter has visited a partial screening of "Paradise in a Lonely Island," and it can be said that there has been rapid progress in technology, comparable to imported films. Secondly, we see the technical equipment of Da Di Company and feel that they should get such excellent results. The camera they use is the latest "Beyer Good" machine specially designed for sound films with five lenses. The recorder is the only silent recorder designed and manufactured in China by Luo Jingyu. Other equipment such as dubbing, printing, lighting, and editing are only available in the South China film industry.</p>
<p>The technical department of Da Di Company is also personally responsible by Mr. Luo Jingyu, the head of the company. Mr. Luo has made many contributions to film technology after the War of Resistance, which does not need to be introduced much. As for the heavy responsibilities of the drama and affairs, they are presided over by Mr. Tan Youliu. In addition, the famous photographer Mr. Wu Wei serves as the photographer, and the experienced Mr. Ye Jian serves as the set designer. From this ideal team of workers, it can be determined that it will definitely become an ideal work.</p>
<p>Never being careless about works has always been one of the characteristics of Mr. Cai Chusheng's success. He will go to great lengths to express the parts that should be seen by the audience and that the audience needs to see, and he will never abuse film techniques to avoid difficulties. In the script, he has already thought about the details of the play very carefully and written it very detailed. Before the filming of each scene, he uses a watch to plan the position of each actor. This kind of work is also something that directors in southern China have never done. Only through arduous struggle can there be outstanding performance. After "Morning in the Metropolis," "Song of the Fishermen," "New Woman," "The Prodigal Lamb," and "Wang the Bachelor," what kind of "Paradise in a Lonely Island" will we be able to see? This is not difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Work Overview of the Editorial Committee for the History of Chinese Spoken Drama Movement The Ministry of Education Appoints Shu Chang as Editor-in-Chief The History of Drama is Currently Compiled Up to the Return of the Spring Willow Society</h3>
<p>The "Editorial Committee for the History of Chinese Spoken Drama Movement," in order to widely collect historical materials on drama, sent a letter to this newspaper's editor, Lu Fu, and Nanhua College's secretary, Wang Yongzai, asking them to be responsible for collecting materials in Hong Kong. This news has been recorded in previous issues of this journal. Now, Lu and Wang have begun to plan the methods for collecting historical materials. In addition to consulting with various drama pioneers and the heads of various theater groups, they have also rushed to print two types of survey forms, one for groups and one for individuals, which can be sent out as soon as they are printed during the day.</p>
<p>Regarding the overview of the committee, many comrades have inquired. Now we will briefly report its general situation in advance to answer the concerned friends:</p>
<p>In January of this year, Yu Shangyuan, the principal of the National Academy of Drama, was ordered by the Ministry of Education to organize the "Editorial Committee for the History of Chinese Spoken Drama Movement," with Yu Shangyuan, Zhang Daofan, Wan Jiabao, Gu Yiqiao, Liang Baoqiu, Zhao Taiyou, Huang Zuolin, Yan Zhewu, Shu Chang (Weiqing), etc. as members, concurrently serving as the editor-in-chief, and formally engaged in the collection, compilation, and printing of historical materials on the Chinese spoken drama movement.</p>
<p>The editor-in-chief of the committee, Shu Chang, currently works at the National Academy of Drama. For more than 20 years, he has successively promoted the spoken drama movement in Ping, Tianjin, Yu, Zhe, Gan, Xiang, and E. He also specializes in the collection of dramatic books, publications, pictures, and historical materials on acting. He has compiled books such as "A Catalogue of Modern Dramatic Books."</p>
<p>According to a letter from Mr. Shu Chang: The history of the movement has now been compiled up to the return of the Spring Willow Society. The first stage is about to be completed, and he hopes that the pioneers of the drama world will send initial historical materials to enrich it.

<h3>Football Charity Match Canceled Due to Rain Today, South China Plays Sailors At 5:15 PM at Jia Shan</h3>
<p>(Reported by This Newspaper) It's almost the Plum Rain season, and there's plenty of rain. Now, it's still being implemented. Hong Kong, which restricts food at 3:30 PM against Haiguang, the rain is the sweet dew for the residents. However, every Thursday at 4:30 PM, Da Zhong vs. Taikoo, and 5:30 PM and Sundays, are good days for football players to be active. Generally, pleasure-seeking fans, Spring Grass vs. Kang Yuan, judging by the strength of each team, no one wants to have their excitement spoiled by the rain on these two days. It would be a shame to miss the good times. For example, yesterday, the Bell Sound team coordinated well. Haiguang should not be the original two good orders in the football world, (1) is the South China vs. All-Star football charity match, the enemy, Taikoo is slightly stronger than Da Zhong, there is (2) is the Chinese vs. Friends Cup baseball league. If it were performed, it would definitely cause a sensation. Winning is possible. Spring Grass defends well, and can definitely defeat Kang Yuan. But today, heaven is not cooperating.</p>
<p>That football charity match, since it missed the good opportunity due to rain, it is feared that it cannot continue. Because the football players of the All-Star team are selected by several associations. Since yesterday's match was not successful, the General Association cannot immediately notify the football players to change the game to today. Moreover, the soldiers of the Army rarely play football on Sundays. Therefore, even if the General Association can immediately notify them separately, it may not be possible to form a team and compete with South China. Therefore, the person in charge of the General Association has notified South China yesterday that this charity match will not be held today. And South China is about to leave for a southern tour, and there is no suitable date to meet with the All-Star team. Let's wait until they return to Hong Kong before pleading for the refugees.</p>
<p>However, South China has agreed to a practice match with the sailors of the British warship HMS Gannet at Jia Shan at 5:15 PM today. If it clears up today, then this battle will definitely be carried out on time. It is said that there are many capable members in this team of sailors, and their strength is very strong. Therefore, South China has also compiled a perfect lineup to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>Zhang Jinhai, a football player from Shanghai, has been working very hard in every practice match since joining South China. The South China authorities attach great importance to him. Therefore, he has been specially transferred to play as the right midfielder today. Let's see how he performs after changing his style. Also, Liu Songsheng, who has been absent for many months due to a foot injury, has recently fully recovered. Today, he will wear his uniform again. The lineup is arranged as follows: (Tai Sui)</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Liang Bowen</p>
<p>Tan Zhenhui Liu Qingcai Zhang Jinhai</p>
<p>Luo Douwen Ye Beihua Chen De Liu Songsheng Yang Shuiyi</p>

<h3>For Beginner Swimmers (1) Several Common Mistakes</h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>Swimming is a full-body exercise and an essential life-saving skill. In the southern country, where it is suitable for all seasons, it is an especially supreme exercise. However, beginners often have mistakes that they do not realize themselves, and the result of this mistake can affect swimming technique to a small extent, and endanger life to a large extent. Now, I will list several common mistakes, hoping that beginners will pay attention to correcting them.</p>
<p>(1) Panic and Fear of Water Water has natural "buoyancy" and "pressure." Beginners, without understanding the nature of water, are affected by buoyancy after entering the water, and feel that their hands cannot move, their feet cannot take steps, and their bodies are swaying and falling. All movements are beyond their control. Affected by the pressure, the chest feels bound and breathing is not free. They are anxious and flustered, and in a precarious situation. There is no right place all over the body. Therefore, they doubt that water is something that cannot be conquered by human power, and they naturally develop a fear of water. They panic and act abnormally. All the dangers in the water are created from this. You must know that since water has "buoyancy," it can naturally help us float to the surface. As long as you are familiar with the nature of water, use a calm mind and appropriate methods to use this "buoyancy," you can naturally achieve all the requirements of swimming technique. There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of water.</p>
<p>(2) Raising the Head and Bending the Knees Beginners, because water will enter the lungs from the nostrils and mouth when breathing, in order to facilitate breathing and avoid danger, always raise their heads out of the water. Because the feet are subjected to the pressure of the water, it is not easy to lift them up when they are straightened. In order to facilitate movement, they all bend their knees when kicking water. However, whether an object can float in the water depends on its weight and the size of the area attached to the water surface. For objects of the same size and the same weight, if they are to float, the part attached to the water surface must be the largest. For example, a piece of wood, when it floats on the water, it must be horizontal, not vertical. This is a very simple example. Therefore, if a person is to float in the water, they must also try to maximize the part of the whole body that is on the water surface. If you raise your head and bend your knees, then the part of the whole body attached to the water surface will be reduced by the bending of the head and feet, and it will naturally feel difficult to float. The reason why beginners cannot float more than they want to is because of this.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Baseball Game Was Stopped by Rain Two Games Will Be Held Today If the Weather Clears The Second Act South China vs. Mindi Nu Is Sure to Be Spectacular</h3>
<p>Yesterday's baseball league was stopped due to rain. If the weather is good today, there will be two games held at 10:00 AM. (1) Western Association vs. Hong Kong Association, (2) Mindi Nu vs. South China Association. It is predicted that there will be a fierce battle in the second act, because the Mindi team is fierce enough, and the South China team is experienced enough. When two heroes meet, it is really unknown who will win. South China baseball players such as Bao Jiaping and Feng Jingxiang are both fierce football players. They will depart with the South China football team for a southern expedition and will not be able to return until September.

<h3>Current Students (4) The Necessary Reforms for Physical Training</h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>Students are mostly singing an agreeable tune about this movement, doing whatever they please, regardless of what is called posture, whether it is correct or not, and even less willing to take it into account. The reasons for this are, firstly, because they are used to being casual and moving casually, which easily suits their casual intentions; secondly, because they are lazy by nature, and doing exercise according to the correct posture is bound to feel strenuous, hoping to save effort, so they are unwilling to do the correct posture. It must be known that without correct posture in exercise, it is impossible to obtain the benefits of exercise. For example: the effect of the twisting exercise in gymnastics is originally in the abdomen and waist. During practice, the feet should not move and rotate with the direction of the twisting movement, otherwise, the effect will only reach the feet, not the abdomen and waist. This directly affects the body; also, in sports such as track and field and ball games, not following the correct posture, although only affects the results on the surface, often reduces interest due to poor results, and unwillingness to continue efforts, and the result is still affecting health. This is casual exercise, which must be reformed into correct and arduous exercise.</p>
<p>In peacetime, for the sake of hobbies, they often do only one kind of exercise that they like. As a result, the effect is often biased towards a local part, forming a deformed development; they specialize in the development of muscles while ignoring the training of internal organs, resulting in a defect of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. It must be known that any part of the body that cannot get normal development can affect health. We certainly cannot only do exercises for part A while ignoring exercises for part B; we also cannot ignore the direct exercise of part B because part B has an indirect opportunity for exercise when we exercise part A. Because indirect exercise is never as rapid as direct exercise. This is local exercise, which must be reformed into exercise that develops all parts of the body evenly.</p>
<p>Students who do not go to the sports field all day long and rarely have the opportunity to exercise throughout the year cannot get the benefits of physical training. Students who are in the sports field all day long, regardless of whether their physical strength is competent, just move and work hard, cannot get the benefits of physical training, either. The so-called "too much is as bad as too little" is true. However, I think that the disadvantages of too much are better than too little. Those who are too little can reach the appropriate level as long as they intensify their efforts. Those who are too much: lightly, they need a considerable period of rest to recover to their original state, and the previous hard work is all in vain; heavily, they need long-term treatment, or even harm their body, and there is no hope of recovery for life. This is too much or too little exercise, which must be reformed into exercise that is appropriate and moderate.</p>
<p>Exercising under the supervision of the teacher, exercising when there are many people and the atmosphere is lively, exercising when there is a good environment, exercising when the exercise suits the individual's wishes, and otherwise not exercising, is sporadic or intermittent exercise. No matter how much you move in a day, or how much you move at a time, the result is as useless as eating multiple times a day, skipping many days before eating again, eating a lot at a time, and then not eating next time, which does not provide nutrition to the body. This is intermittent exercise, which must be reformed into exercise that is persistent and persevering.</p>
<p>"Climbing high must start from the bottom." "Traveling far must start from the near." These are the best examples of doing things that must be done step by step. When practicing exercise, not only should we proceed step by step according to the individual's developmental order and physical condition; even in each practice, we should proceed step by step according to physiological needs. When starting exercise, the body has not reached a strong level, and we should first use gentle and universally developing exercises to lay a good foundation, and then gradually use exercises with greater momentum to improve health. At the beginning of each exercise, because the body temperature is low and the muscles have not been prepared, we should first use gentle exercises to warm up the body and activate the joints, and then gradually increase the momentum to achieve the purpose of exercise. Disregarding everything and doing the same formal ball game exercises is burying the health of the delivery. This is cross-level and indiscriminate exercise, which must be reformed into exercise that is step by step.</p>
<p>In short, in this extraordinary period, the country's extraordinary elements—students—should have extraordinary physiques to cope with extraordinary environments and complete the extraordinary cause of resisting the war and revealing the country. This is known to everyone. However, to have an extraordinary physique, we must have an extraordinary determination for physical training, correct all the previous incorrect understandings, and change the wrong paths to have the confidence of sure success.

<h3>Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities; Changes in the Domestic Economic Situation (Continued): Excessive Optimism About the Abnormal Prosperity of the Shanghai Market Is Unwarranted; Development of the Southwest Economy Depends on Transportation Infrastructure; Annual Report of the Shanghai Bank</h3>
<p>Trade</p>
<p>This year, our country's foreign trade has been severely affected by the war. Total import trade amounted to 86,199,000 yuan, a decrease of 67,186,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Total export trade amounted to 762,641,000 yuan, a decrease of 75,615,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The trade deficit was 123,558,000 yuan, an increase of 8,428,000 yuan compared to the previous year. However, the above figures do not accurately reflect the severity of the impact, as the total value of import trade by customs is converted into national currency based on the legal exchange rate of the gold unit, while the total value of export trade has been automatically adjusted based on the black market exchange rate. If both were converted into pounds sterling at the black market exchange rate, the total value of import trade would be £49,708,000, a decrease of £7,079,000 compared to the previous year, and the total value of export trade would be £31,470,000, a decrease of £18,301,000, while the trade deficit would be £18,213,700, an enormous increase of £11,220,000 compared to the previous year, indicating that the decline in exports was even greater than the decline in imports.</p>
<p>Production Stagnation: This stems from the westward shift of the war and the widening of the war zone. Production enterprises have been greatly damaged, and the output of local goods has naturally decreased. Coupled with the obstruction of transportation and the difficulty of shipping, the only channel for export throughout the year was the Canton-Hankou Railway line, which was also interrupted in the autumn. Fortunately, the government established a trade adjustment agency to actively encourage exports, allowing large quantities of local goods to be exported quickly; otherwise, the decline in the value of export trade would have been even greater.</p>
<p>Grains and Flour: Among imported goods, the largest increase was in grains and flour, totaling 130,004,000 yuan, an increase of over 71 million yuan compared to the previous year. Wheat flour alone increased by over 46 million yuan, and rice imports also increased by 16 million yuan. This is because the inland food supply could not be transported and sold in large quantities due to the war, and coastal ports had to rely on imported food.</p>
<p>Metals and Ores: The largest decrease in imports was in metals and ores, totaling 65,117,000 yuan, a decrease of 66 million yuan compared to the previous year. Various construction projects were suspended this year, and metal transportation was particularly difficult, resulting in a large decrease in imports. The largest import quantities, in order, were grains and flour, miscellaneous goods, oils, candles and soaps, metals and ores, chemical medicines, machinery and tools, paper, and vehicles.</p>
<p>Textiles: The largest increase in exports was in textiles, totaling 165,127,000 yuan, an increase of over 36 million yuan compared to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in cotton exports, mostly to Japan, reaching approximately 10,100,000 yuan, an increase of nearly 70 million yuan compared to the previous year. However, exports of other textiles, such as wool and raw silk, decreased (to be continued).</p>

<h3>Only Practice, Don't Worship</h3>
<p>— Shi Chao</p>
<p>What is art? Art is the product of the labor of those who create form.</p>
<p>What is an artist? An artist is a laborer who changes the position of this or that element of the surrounding environment in space, a person whose activities are harmonious.</p>
<p>I used to say this, and I still say it now: "We should learn from any avant-garde or pioneer, but we should not worship them."</p>
<p>We should only call out to the avant-garde of art like the Roman people did to the rich of that time: "Give us bread and beauty... give us beautiful impressions! And these impressions should be rich, diverse, and bright; they must be above average, above what we normally see." We should demand this and prepare to learn and accept, but we should not pray like foolish believers pray to God.</p>
<p>However, the younger generation following the avant-garde mostly misunderstands this. They see every avant-garde artist as something sacred and inviolable. They do not go to the treasure trove of the avant-garde to learn and accept his rich wealth, but only kneel far away, where even the eyes of our avant-garde cannot see, to worship and murmur prayers, enshrining him at home and everywhere... This is so pitiful.</p>
<p>We must know that the avant-garde inevitably passes on the wealth he has received from his ancestors, equally or even more, to his beloved younger generation, as long as they are willing to learn. Ostrovsky said: "He (the avant-garde) distributes the wealth given to him unreservedly to us."</p>
<p>Of course, treating the avant-garde as a lifeless, soulless puppet and worshiping him not only prevents us from extracting his wealth but is also undoubtedly a great insult to him. No matter how talented or profound our avant-garde is, he is still a person with flesh and blood, a soul, advantages, and shortcomings. His theories, his actions, everything he does will be mostly right due to his rich experience and deep cultivation, but we cannot say that everything is absolutely right. The reason is simply that the avant-garde is also a person - no different from ordinary people. It is clear that there is only learning between people, and no worship.</p>
<p>May 20th marks the 50th birthday of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, an avant-garde artist in our country's drama movement. In order to honor this laborer who has resolutely and painstakingly worked in the drama movement for two or thirty years and shed much sweat in the history of China's weak drama movement, theatrical workers throughout Hong Kong are staging the national historical drama "Pan Huagang." This is certainly a very meaningful event, but the meaning of our celebration is not to worship Mr. Ouyang but to learn from him. This point needs to be emphasized.</p>
<p>What should we learn from him?</p>
<p>First is his courage; second is his courage; and third is still his courage in replacing China's old drama, which has existed for thousands of years, with new content and making the most of new forms so that the old drama can adapt to the great combat stage and successfully become a powerful propaganda tool in the process of resisting Japan and building the country.</p>
<p>He courageously took the legacy of advanced Western European dramatists and transferred it to China, resulting in beautiful achievements in China's spoken drama movement.</p>
<p>He courageously stood tall in China's 20-year drama movement, persevering unwaveringly to this day.</p>
<p>He used to study bravely and painstakingly, and he still studies bravely and painstakingly, pouring every drop of attention and spirit into China's spoken drama movement. On the one hand, he generously gives the rich experience he has gained through his labor to the younger generation; on the other hand, he continues to work hard to learn and pursue.</p>
<p>He is brave...</p>
<p>These are all things we should learn from, and I believe he will be very willing to offer everything without reservation, as long as the younger generation does not treat him as an idol to be worshiped but diligently learns from him.</p>
<h3>Trio</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Sea Fantasy</p>
<p>The sea breeze is like an inspiration with a strange smell. I want to spread my wings and fly out of the harbor, floating on the sea, counting the floating ships, singing songs of leaving home. How many people rush to the future with various hearts, reflecting different clear shadows, leaving different moods. In the harbor and on the beach, sons go far away, with white sails sending them on their way. After sending them off, there is another wave of melancholy.</p>
<p>The sea breeze is like an inspiration with a strange smell. I want to dive into the water, swim quietly, explore the secret mansion of the ocean, and search for a pure land on earth. The darkness of the seabed, a piece of green, cannot resist the smoke of war and is also stained with red spots. Following the heart fire of the expeditionaries, it sings the rhythm of justice. Countless hatreds, endless emotions, float to the sea with the bubbles, and the sea breeze blows them away.</p>
<p>The Old Man's White Hair Rhapsody</p>
<p>The ripples on the sea surface reflect the old man's white hair, silver threads.</p>
<p>Each fine, soft white hair conceals a ghost in the bottom of his heart—or perhaps a dead rose.</p>
<p>Youths Love the Mountains, Old Men Love the Sea</p>
<p>Because youths will release their emotions in the mountains, they will run, jump, and accompany the souls outside their bodies. They climb from one mountain peak to another. The sun belongs to them, giving them heat and strength, especially in wartime, crossing mountains and ridges, millions of youths united as one.</p>
<p>Old men will chew the remaining flavors in the depths of their souls on the sea. The moon belongs to them, the eternal brilliance of the moon causes his cold mood to repeatedly fall into the dreams of the past. I remember it was a severe winter one year, the military orders flashed by the golden spears, and the roaring of war drums had exchanged for the heads and livers of many enemies—or, perhaps, in May of a certain year, the spring was not yet old, and the scenery was teasing people to laugh, he had left a paper shadow for a beautiful young girl: and, in the twilight of drizzle, the hazy spring colors of the garden, just leaving the first bit of scenery, he had walked slowly, wanting to seek a heavenly blue crown. Now, the blue crown is only a faint trace on paper, eroded by time.</p>
<p>In the white hair, the twilight of the graveyard is visible again; the evening glow passes through two rows of white fields, truly the sunset is infinitely beautiful, and the spring breeze gently blows the willow branches. Old man... The aftersound of the rhapsody is like a breeze blowing on the sea, causing slight ripples.</p>
<p>A Story Without Poetry</p>
<p>There is a difference between the lives of young people and the lives of old people: the former is a "life of serving"; the latter is a "life of being served."</p>
<p>Therefore, different stories are always spinning in the sea breeze.</p>
<p>This young man loves that; he loves the goddess, he loves eternal beauty. Everywhere he recognizes himself as a waiter, serving everything he loves—as a result, a historical painting of life is engraved on his heart, and when he is old, when he needs to be served, the history of life in his heart becomes a place where smoke floats.</p>
<p>Let's tell a love story (everything in life can be compared to love)</p>
<p>The love of youth is as hot as a flame; when you get old, you find it is ruined. Love should be like smoking: burning pleasantly, inhaling the smoke pleasantly, and throwing it away pleasantly. A smile flows from the old man's beard, laughing at the young man for making a pleasant thing too serious. (But when old men were young, didn't they do the same? This is an entangled soft thread!)</p>
<p>The shadows of golden spears on the battlefield aroused a more peaceful smile in the old man's heart.</p>
<p>I said that old men love the sea; therefore, the image of a kind and pure white old man appears on the sea again.</p>
<h3>In Dinggou</h3>
<p>— Tong Shouping</p>
<p>A Brief Record of Mobile Propaganda</p>
<p>Now setting out for the third time, the location is in Dinggou.</p>
<p>Dinggou is about thirty li away from our base area. No one has ever propagated there before. The local situation is said to be quite good, so we decided to go there once. After traveling for three hours, we first arrived at the Dinggou Municipal Elementary School. The principal said he had not returned from the city on official business, and a Mr. Shi represented him to greet us. He expressed a warm welcome to us and said:</p>
<p>"At this time, it is really rare that you can come to our remote and impoverished town, and we are very grateful. Many people here hold the idea of sweeping only the snow in front of their own doors, and they are simply unwilling to listen to national affairs, let alone allow others to talk about them. Today, you have come from afar, and I think it will definitely stimulate them. In fact, our own capabilities are too weak..." Then he modestly showed a smile, and we all laughed along.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi led the students to assemble on the playground. Then Comrade Qiu gave a speech.</p>
<p>A group here began to put up posters and bought paper to write many temporary ones.</p>
<p>A burst of applause erupted on the playground. Comrade Qiu's moving speech was wonderful. Then Mr. Shi gave a supplementary speech. Suddenly, a cheer came from afar. Behind the woods to the west, a column of students was slowly walking and singing songs. I asked Mr. Shi, and only then did I know that their branch principal had received the news and gathered the students to come and participate. We felt extremely excited, watching the line walk into the playground and stand in order. Through Mr. Shi's introduction, we met the branch principal, Mr. Huang. Under the common goal of "For the Sake of the Country," we warmly shook hands and talked.</p>
<p>Gradually, a pale white sun peeked out from the clouds and hung tightly on the treetops on the western pond. The students standing still, after Mr. Shi's instructions, gradually formed a long line, following behind us, walking out of the school gate. In this way, we paraded around the town for a week. The tragic songs and passionate slogans, echoed by hundreds of large and small throats, stirred the entire town, and people were all shocked!</p>
<p>Night gradually enveloped all around. We re-entered the school and began to give speeches. Thanks to Mr. Shi's enthusiasm, he really gave us a great help. In the square outside the school, he specially built a stage for us. As it was getting dark, we hung up a gasoline lamp, which was as bright as day. People from all around flocked from the darkness to this bright occasion, stood still, and stretched their necks, looking at the stage, watching us perform under the bright lights: "Northeast Compatriots" and "The Confused Egg."</p>
<p>More and more audiences gathered. From the stage, we could see the facial expressions of the people standing close, showing anger and joy with the plot. Many people were also involved in acting on the spot. Some thoughtful old grandfathers, old grandmothers who recited scriptures and worshiped Buddha, and some young men like young masters - even more interested in standing in the crowd and staring intently.</p>
<p>The night wind swept across the square, and the temperature dropped even lower. However, we did not feel cold, and the audience did not feel cold either. We resisted until we finished our work. Only then did we put on thick clothes. Finally, people gradually moved and dispersed, leaving a lonely square.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi had prepared accommodation for us long ago. Dozens of desks were pieced together into a giant bed in a school classroom. Two young men, wrapped in eight or nine quilts, spent a cold winter night.</p>
<h3>Illusion</h3>
<p>— Dian Chang</p>
<p>I once had a beautiful and ethereal dream. After excessive nervous exhaustion, a sense of desolation arose in my heart. It was as thick as wine, yet as light as water, just as the colors were about to fade.</p>
<p>I... I seemed to be standing on the summit of a high mountain, precarious and majestic. The yellow glow caressed the top of my head, as if it were a crown. White clouds gently soothed my back. Even more proudly, I raised my head, looked up at the sky, my chest steeped in the rich rain and dew, looking down at the myriad things beneath my feet: the winding long rivers, the lush and boundless fields, the square city lying prostrate, the neatly arranged houses, the undulating mountains, the lakes and marshes as clear as mirrors. Occasionally, a few wisps of smoke and mist lightly locked, hazy and misty, wandering like gossamer, lingering and permeating, and far away, outside the azure sky, boundless and infinite... Everything was very peaceful, serene—I wondered: how could there be tranquility and peace here? When did they escape this specialized place? Where did they come from? Was I exhausted, longing for tranquility and peace—the world's sound and peace had long been extinguished, was death the end here, or was this an illusion?</p>
<p>I bid farewell to the ridge of the mountain. I seemed to be lying on the edge of the water, leaning against a boulder, steadily stroking the thriving shallow grass with my hand, moistening and smoothing its fresh fragrance, the nourishment of the black soil. Occasionally, I turned my head and gazed at the old mountain, but it had become a faint gray, the bend in the mountain... as if it were an eyebrow, beautiful but sad!</p>
<p>After a while, the high mountain... was gone, the faint gray... became a vast expanse, a blood-smeared expanse. I was astonished: where to find the vastness? (It turned out that everything before was really an illusion!) A wave of shame struck my heart, so I stood up straight from the boulder—but the boulder had already rotted. How quickly the boulder disappeared! The spine felt stiff, breathing was somewhat suffocated, I waved my hand silently... I went crazy, my frenzy reverberating through heaven and earth—carried by the sad wind to all directions. I don't know where, but an ancient bronze sound of heaven responded: Honglong! I vaguely saw a few crows in the distant trees... looking at the wings of hypocrisy flapping, flapping, hey, is this "tranquility" and "peace"? Hypocrisy, clown! I laughed coldly.</p>
<p>I also heard the faint, weak, intermittent drumming, harmonizing with the cold, desolate wind, like angry frogs, like old cows, even more like cold insects, yet howling even more ghostly. It rustled across the fields, the green among the paths becoming scorched, yellow, withered, rotten. Yet the drumming still tightly embraced the remaining branches and rotten grass, dancing.</p>
<p>Let it dance, this road dance of grass skeletons! ...It was never as thick as wine, nerves were exhausted.</p>
<p>I went through a beautiful and ethereal dream like this. It was never as thick as wine, the nerve Curve was going up. Sober.</p>
<h3>No Need to Wait</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>How many people have had their careers destroyed by the invading hooves of the aggressor? How many have had their rice bowls shattered by the invading iron hooves of the aggressor? For nineteen months, we have only heard about the growing seriousness of the unemployment problem and the increasing number of the unemployed—especially in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Those who have unfortunately been caught in the whirlpool of unemployment undoubtedly have their only hope and task in earnestly seeking help from relatives and friends to find a job, lingering at the doors of relatives and friends all day long, using humble words and putting a warm face to a cold face.</p>
<p>However, the facts tell us that the result of earnestly seeking help from relatives and friends to find a job now is that nine out of ten times, you will get a few "modern" words of comfort: "It is really difficult to find a job now, but please don't worry, there will always be a way after the final victory..." It seems that there will be jobs available immediately after the final victory. This "modern" saying is not only the best way for those being asked to deal with those seeking work, but also how the unemployed themselves comfort themselves.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that it will be easier to find a job after the final victory than it is now, but we dare not agree with the general unemployed who sit at home waiting for the final victory. Because the construction period in the future will definitely require talents with sufficient knowledge, rich skills, courageous spirit, and strong physique to build a new China. It will certainly not need ordinary, mediocre people with nothing to eat together. In other words, those without knowledge, skills, and physique will still be the dregs abandoned by the times after the final victory, and their future situation may not be better than it is now. On the contrary, those with knowledge, skills, and abilities that are suitable for the needs of real society have the possibility of not being caught in the whirlpool of unemployment even in the present situation, where the huge tide of unemployment is surging.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who have lost their jobs—especially those trapped in the "isolated island"—must not be deceived by the modern words of comfort from relatives and friends, nor can they entrust their hopes to the final victory because of the difficulty of finding a job. As long as they examine themselves first, they can be sure of their fate. If they do not have unique knowledge, skills, etc., they must find ways to remedy their shortcomings, cultivate their knowledge, practice the skills they are interested in, and exercise their weak physique so that they meet the needs of the country and society after the final victory, and they will not have to worry about the whip of unemployment lashing them. Gorky once said: "Only foolish people are afraid of unemployment, and the terror of unemployment only enters the minds of foolish people..." The lesson these two sentences give us is that we should not be afraid of unemployment and create our own ability to overcome unemployment.</p>
<p>In the interior, no matter where, the work of resisting Japan and building the country is tense. There is no place that does not welcome true talents from various departments to jointly complete the great cause of restoration. Talents with knowledge and skills do not need to be trapped on an "isolated island," knocking on the doors of relatives and friends, and humbly listening to a few "modern" words of comfort. Nor do they need to wait for the final victory. If they have a skill, they can stand on the great stage of national liberation and work, exchanging their wisdom and strength for the final victory. Not only will they solve their own hunger problem, but they will also take a step further to solve the entire unemployment problem and solve the livelihood of the majority of the unemployed.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that unemployed young people who sit at home waiting for the final victory before thinking of a solution are no different from abandoning their careers themselves.</p>
