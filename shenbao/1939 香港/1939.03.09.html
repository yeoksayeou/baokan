<h3 id="c1">蘇聯往何處去？　—論聯共十八屆代表大會的報告 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 晏</p>
<p>蘇維埃社會主義共和國聯邦的共產黨第十八屆代表大會，定於明天三月十日開幕。當此國際形勢激劇轉變，法西斯侵略者加緊推進世界大戰，和平陣綫積極謀求鞏固與擴展其勢力的時候，被　爲世界和平柱石的蘇聯的態度與其內情，自然是全世界一致注目的，而這次聯共第十八屆代表大會，則一面將聽取關於蘇聯共黨一切重要報吿，一面又將根據這些報吿來作影響全聯邦以至全世界的决定，所以這次大會，尤爲世界各國人民所注目。這次大會中，蘇聯人民委員會委昌長莫洛托夫氏，將提出關于發展蘇聯國民經濟的「第三個五年計劃』，而齊達諾夫氏則將提出「修正黨章綱要』。莫齊兩氏報吿之特別値得注意，就在這兩個報吿不僅說明蘇聯最近的內情，並且預示了蘇聯今後的趨向。英勇抗戰二十個月而且續向抗戰建國之途邁進的中國同胞，對於友邦蘇聯的內情與其動向，自然更應屛除情感，袪除成見，平心靜氣地加以檢閱，則不僅對於揚厲於市的一切謠言邪說，固然可以不惑不慮，而對於我國抗戰建國前途與國際情勢，亦可獲得正確的認識，與堅定勝利的信心。</p>
<p>（一）關於第三個五年計劃的報告</p>
<p>莫洛托夫氏關於發展蘇聯國民經濟第三個五年計劃「一九三八——一九四二」的報吿，曾於本年新年在蘇聯數百萬種報紙上發表，並且展開全國勞動人民大衆的熱烈的討論，獲得一致的忠誠的擁護。莫洛托夫氏的報吿，首先指出</p>
<p>第二個五年計劃的成功</p>
<p>蘇聯第二個五年計劃圓滿完成的結果，是它已經完成其建設社會主義國家的主要的歷史任務·它已經肅淸一切剝削階級。它巳經根絕一切足以發生人對人的剝削·及劃分人爲　削者與被剝削者的因素。它已經完成了社會主義革命最艱難的任務——業集體化，集體農塲的制度，現巳根深帶固了，它並已建立起社會主義之第一階段。社會主義的勝利，已經具體表現在蘇聯新憲法內。截至第二五年計劃結束時上，社會主義產業巳　全國生產資金總數　分之九八·七，社會主義生產巳經完全控制整個國民經濟，達工業總生產額百分之九九·八；農業總生產額百分之九八·六；貿易總額百分之一百。一九三七年，社會主義經濟雇用的工人職員佔全國人數百分之三四·七，集體農民及手藝合作社團結的手工業人數佔百分之五五·五，軍人學生及受瞻養者及其他佔百分之四三。因此·全國人口百分之儿四·四，巳經直接從事於社會主義經濟，或與社會主義經濟發生密切的關係了，此外</p>
<p>國民經濟之技術的全部改造</p>
<p>是第二五年計劃之主要的决定的任務，現在亦巳在大體上獲得成功。一九三七年全部工業生產中，百分之八十以上是第一第二兩五年計劉內新建或全部改造的工廠產出，農業全部　引機及刈打聯合機約百分之九十，是第二五年計劃期內由蘇聯本國自製。第二個工業五年計劃，已於一九三七年四月以四年又三個月的時間提前完成。鐵道運輸部份則史在四年以內就巳完成，而且成績超過計劃。農業部份，關於糧食及棉花，亦已超過計劃。計一九三七年工業生產較一九二二增加百分之一二〇，而原則計劃僅爲百分之一一四。又第二五年計劃期內，每年工業生產平均增加百分之一七，一，原定計劃則僅爲百分之一六·七·尤其是經過第二五年計劃完成以來，一切經濟部門已培植成功能够把握新技術的幹部，其中最大成功，是蘇維埃知識份子中重要幹部的提出，及一切經濟部門中新領導工人之大胆的提拔，因爲不問此種幹部是黨員或黨外的布爾雪維克份子，部是社會主義建設各方四所必需的。（這種精神在今日中國自然更値得鼓勵），尤其是斯　罕諾夫運動，更鮮明地反映了　聯建設把握新技術的成功。第二九年計劃期內，大工業勞動生產率提高達百分之八二，原定計劃則僅爲百分之六三。</p>
<p>物質及文化　準提高</p>
<p>第二五年計劃中能規定的任務，一提高工人階級物質及文化水準，使　費程度增加二倍餘』亦已完成了。國民經濟各部鬥的工人職員人數，增加百分之一七。六，工人職員每年平均工資，一九三七較一九三二年增加了百分之一一三·五。國家撥付工農文化及物質服務（敎育，衛生等）的經費，從四十四萬萬增至一百四十萬萬盧布。又一九三三至三七的四年內·集體農民的總收入亦增達二·七倍。一九三七年必需品的生產較一九三二年增二倍餘，國家及合作貿易總額增五倍以上。而同計劃期內，國內實際經過了文化革侖，中小學生由二千一百三十萬增至二千九百四十萬名，大學生增至五十五萬名，而蘇聯東方人民物質文化的進步尤爲迅速·</p>
<p>蘇聯的新階段</p>
<p>第二五年計劃結束，第三五年計刻開始，蘇聯全國進入一新階段，完成一個無　級社會主義的建設，從社會主義漸轉　至共產主義的階段·莫洛托夫對於這個新階段的任務，有很明白的指示：</p>
<p>此階段內勞動民衆之共產主義的敎育，自有其决定的重要性。它要尅服人民（共產主義建設者）心中的資本主義的殘餘，蘇聯業經轉變爲一經濟獨立的國家，能以一切必要技術設備供應本國經濟及匯防。蘇聯在工業發展率上佔世界第一位，蘇聯工業生產總額，與技術上經濟上最前進的資本主義國家比較上之不足，必須澈底掃除，俾共產主義得在與資本主義的歷史競爭中，取得最後勝利。我們現在能够，而且必須實行，將完成蘇聯主要的經濟任務之責任自己担負起來，在經濟園地追及並超過歐洲最發達的資本主義國家及美國，在最近的將來解决這個問題。同時新計劃內，我們必須促進國民收入及貿易額的增加，使民衆消費量得增加一倍半至二倍，進一步與此類主要任務相配合，必須提高一切城市農村勞動民衆的文化水準，使工人階級——會主義最前列的領導勢力——的文化及技術程度，邁進至工程師及技師的水平。</p>
<p>莫氏的報吿中指出在第二五年計劃期內，工業及全部國民經濟已有極大的發展，現在更要求其按照固定計劃，有進一步無阻礙的成長，尤其在帝國主義勞力加緊侵略及包圍蘇聯的條件下，自必須創立大規模國的家儲備，首先關於燃料，電力，一部份國際工業，以及運輸業的發展。</p>
<p>第三個五年計劃內容</p>
<p>蘇聯怎樣實踐莫氏報吿中的目前新階段的新任務呢？第三個五年計劃配合上述任務，提出如下各項規定：</p>
<p>工業方面</p>
<p>規定一九四二年（第三五年計劃末年）蘇聯全部工業總生產額應爲一千八百萬萬盧布，較一九三七年的九百五十五萬萬，增加白分之八八。其中生產工具的生產增百分之一〇三，消費品生產增百分之六九·今年蘇聯工業應製出汽車一百四十萬噸，生產電力七百五十萬萬千瓦小時，煤二萬三千萬噸，石油五千四百萬頓，銑　二千二萬噸，鋼二千七百七十萬噸，滾鐵二千一百萬噸，化學品總値一百三十四萬萬盧布，機器製造工業生產應增二·二五倍，提高煤炭生產，使不僅足够國內經常需要，並可成立國家儲備；在伏爾加河與烏拉嶺創立新石油根據地『第二巴庫』，展開各種燃料的氣化工作，尤其是煤炭的地下氣化，使其成爲一種獨立工業；根據硬性燃料　氣法，創造人工液體燃料工業，首先在東方實行，並用人工使氣體變爲液體燃料，增加各電廠的總發電量至二·一倍，變化學工業爲主要工業部門之一，以應國民經濟及國防的需要·此外，第三五年計劃還應爲化學的五年計劃，化學工業生產應增二。三倍，　鐵工業亦應不斷增加生產，使同計劃亦成爲特種的五年計劃。一般消費品的生產，應增一。七倍，工業勞動生產率應提高百分之六五，生產成本則應降低百分之十一。</p>
<p>農業方面</p>
<p>農業總生產額，規定內一九三七年的一百九十八萬可增至一九四二年的三百〇二萬萬盧布、卽增加百分之五三；同時。每年平均糧食收穫額，規定自第二五年計劃期內的五十五萬萬油得增至七十萬萬蒲得，卽增加百分之廿七；工業作物收獲額至一九四二年，規定增至甜菜三萬萬公擔，棉花三千二百九十萬公擔，亞麻八百五十萬萬公擔，牲畜中馬增加白分之三五，牛百分之四〇，猪百分之百，　羊及山羊百分之一〇，農業方法之機械化，亦應澈底完成，</p>
<p>運輸方面</p>
<p>運輸方面鐵道貨運規定自一化三七年之三千五百五十萬萬頓公里增至一九四二年之五千一百萬萬噸公里；河道貨運自三百三十萬萬噸公里增到五百八十萬萬噸公里，鐵道　車增加七·三七〇輛，車輛十九萬輛，建築新　道一萬一千公里，舖設雙軌八千公里，　道電力化一·八四〇公里，內河可航水道自一〇一·〇〇〇公里增闢至一一五·〇〇〇公里·至本計劃結束時　北冰洋航綫變爲經常可航的水道，與遠東保持正常交通。汽車　輸增四·六倍，建築及改造公路廿一萬公里。</p>
<p>其他方面</p>
<p>人才方面，莫氏報吿文中建議訓練各　專門技　員一百〇四千名，受過高（等　育的專門人才六十萬名·</p>
<p>又第三五年計劃內資本建設總値規定爲一千八百？萬萬盧布（第二五年計劃爲一千一百五十萬萬盧布）其中工業佔一千〇三十三萬萬，運輸估三百五十八萬萬，農業一百〇六萬萬，開辦總值一千七百九十萬盧布的新造及改造的工廠，增加各電力廠總發電量，使目八十萬萬千瓦增至一百七十二萬萬千瓦，增加煤業生產量一·七倍，鋼鉄廠生產量至二千四百萬噸，銑鉄業至二·四倍，鋁　至三·八倍，汽車業至二·四倍，棉業至倍半。</p>
<p>特別加速遠東方面建設</p>
<p>蘇聯第三個五年計劃中，特別值得注意的是規定特別加速遠東方面建設，莫氏文中規定：東方及遠東各區域的資本建設及工廠建築應特別加速進行，以全力發展此等區域的冶金業，在東部創設大紡織工業，使用中亞細亞的棉花·保證民族共和國及省區之進一步的經濟及文化發展。</p>
<p>至第三五年計劃內應建立的大工廠是重機器工具製造廠數處，鍋輪製造廠五處，小型汽車製造廠數處，西伯利亞及遠東的新汽車裝配及運貨汽車廠多處·紡車及織機製造廠數處·開始創造世界最大的建設工程，庫比雪夫的兩座水電廠，總量三百四十萬千瓦。開始建造卡魯加水電廠，造成烏里克·李賓斯克，契爾齊克，卡納基爾，斯維爾（兩座）尼伐（兩座），蘇杜米等水電廠，開始建築水電廠一座及地方熱力電廠九十一座，開發年產共一萬五千萬噸的新　　數處，開辦新煉油廠　處，總　一千五百萬噸，精煉廠數處，總量四百五十萬噸。完成參尼托戈斯克鋼廠，諾伐塔吉爾，黑龍江之彼特洛夫斯克查彼卡里廠，查普洛西廠，亞吉夫鋼版廠，烏拉爾及尼柯波鋼管廠的建築工程；在南烏拉爾及東西伯里亞開始建染新鋼鐵廠數處，烏拉爾建電桿鋼管廠一處，中央區域建　管廠一處，建築新煉鐵風爐二十座，非　工業方面，完成巴爾希　銅廠及中烏拉爾與布里維亞聯合廠，開始建築賈卡干及亞爾馬甲煉銅廠，阿爾泰煉鉛鉄廠，開辦烏拉爾鉛廠，甘達拉夏及李賓斯特鉛廠，南烏拉爾及北方鎳廠，開始建築新鉛，鋅，錫，鎢，等廠數處·化學工業開始建築新蘇打，硫酸廠數處，人工橡皮廠十四處，車胎廠十四處，帆中廠七處，天然橡皮廠四十六處，人工液體燃料廠二處。</p>
<p>新舊都改造</p>
<p>莫斯科和列寧格勒，並按照原定一劃進一步發展改造。完成莫斯科地下鐵道第三段，大體完成蘇維埃宮。</p>
<p>農業方面增組機器曳引機站一千五百處，建築新榖倉數處，總量一千萬餘噸。</p>
<p>提高城鄉工作人民文化水準方面，勞動民衆的消費量要提高一倍半以上。工人職員人數要較一九三七年增百分之十七，其平均工資增百分之三十五，總工資增百分之六十二·國家撥付文化物質服務事業經費，卽社會保險，敎育，衛生，多兒之津貼等費，要由一九三七年的三百〇八萬萬增至五百三十萬萬盧布。集體農民收入亦要使其大有增加。</p>

<p>國民總收入在五年內要增加一·八倍。</p>
<p>向勝利之途　進</p>
<p>從莫洛托夫氏的報吿文中，可以看到：第一，蘇聯經過第二個五年計劃之後，已經除盡所有剝削階級。根絕一切足以生人對人的剝削及劃分社會爲剝削者的因素，在國內主要上巳經建立起共產主義社會主義的第一階段。第二，第三個五年計劃是根　着蘇聯發展的新階段，而謀完成無階級社會主義的建設，從社會主義漸變至共產主義的階段。第三，爲完成弟三五年計劃，勞動民衆之共產主義的敎育，取得决定的重要性，目前條件巳使蘇維埃知識份子的地位日增重要，他們知道如何以布爾雪維克刀式工作及鬥爭，從而提高勞動民衆的文化水準及共產全義自覺。第而莫溶托夫氏在報吿文中還特別指出，爲完成第三五年計劃規定各任務意見，必須展開社會主議競賽及斯　罕　夫運動，堅决維持勞動紀律，完全淸算托洛斯基派及布哈林派法西斯主義及外國資本家閒諜之反革命破壤活動影響，如强布爾雪維克的警覺性·最後，我們從這報吿文中可以看到的現象：卽目前在蘇聯社會主綫社會的政治經濟地位巳臻鞏固之後，已能把握生產技術之幹部有决定的重要性，此種蘇維埃的文化勢力，將領導勞働大衆從事偉大鬥爭，以爭取共產主養的完全勝利·</p>
<p>（二）關於修正黨　章案的報告　修改衛收黨員條件</p>
<p>齊達諾夫關於修正黨韋綱要的報吿，首先建議的是修改徵收黨員的條件。因爲蘇聯勞動民衆間的階級界限，自第二個五年計劃完成以來，卽巳大致消滅，工人，農民，及知識份子間之經濟的政治的矛盾，亦類就泯除，而趨於消滅，共產黨徵收新黨員的條件，自應加以適要的修改·目前徵收黨員的手續，是按照請求入黨者的社會地位，分爲四等，聯共黨章（聯共第十七屆代表大會一致通過的）第一章規定：</p>
<p>一，凡承認黨綱，在黨的一個組　內工作，服從黨的决議和繳納黨費者，都得認爲黨員。</p>
<p>二，（略）</p>
<p>三，接受黨員只能按個別的手續進行。新黨員是從候補黨員中經過了規定的候補期限，受過了政治常識敎育，領會了黨綱和黨章者接收的，工人集體農民，紅軍兵士，學生和職員，在同情組內，在蘇維埃，職工會，靑年團，合作社和代表會內的工作中有了好的表現，得到了他以前或現在做工地方的組織的批評以後。都得被接收　黨員。</p>
<p>候補黨員轉　黨員的手續如下：</p>
<p>（一）規定四種類；一，工業工人生產年限滿了五年者，二，工業工人生產年限不滿五年者，農業工人，由工人和集體農民出身的紅軍兵士，直接在車間或生產地段上做工的工程技術工作人員，三，集體農民，手工業組合的社員，小學敎員，四，其他職員。</p>
<p>（二）第一類人入黨，須有三個有五年黨齡的黨員介紹，第二類人入黨，須有五個有五年黨齡的黨員介紹；第三類人入黨，須有五個有五年黨齡的黨員介紹和農業機器站政治部或區委一個代表底介紹，第四類人入黨，須有五個有十年黨齡的黨員介紹。</p>
<p>（三）以下略</p>
<p>這種辦法，匪與自社會主義勝利後，蘇聯社會的階級結構情况不合，因此，齊氏報吿提議將目前徵收黨員的等級取消，此後新黨員加入時，無論係工人，　民，或知識份于，其手續應一律相同·</p>
<p>增加黨員權利的規定</p>
<p>過去關於黨員權利，認爲本身自明，而未在黨章內列述，這一吿　　提議於黨章中新增此一條文，規定黨員有權在黨部會議席上，批評任何黨部工作人員，選舉及被選舉入黨部機關，於無論何時，日本人之活動或行爲，經討論决定處置時，要求出席參加，提出任何問題，或聲明於任何黨部組織，包括聯共中央委員會在內。</p>
<p>關於廢除清黨辦法</p>
<p>蘇聯淸黨辦法，是開始實　新經濟政策時採用的，現在情勢演進，此種辦法，自巳沒有繼續存在的理由·同時在實施時的經騐，亦証明此種辦法，不能對各個黨員單獨考察，結果對於善於掩飾的反對份子不生効力，而反易將忠實自覺的黨員以『消極』的　由而加以開除。因此齊氏報吿提議，廢止定期大批淸黨的辦法，建議於决定開除黨籍問題時，必須採取十分愼重的及關心的同志的態度，詳細考察黨員被指摘的理由，保障黨員權利，使不致被任何武斷舉動損害·而以開除黨藉爲黨的最高懲罰，於不得巳時方用之·</p>
<p>切實實現黨內的民主</p>
<p>齊氏報吿又提議於黨章中將蘇聯共黨業巳實行使黨內民主效能切實實現的各項辦法，列爲具體條文，如黨部選舉的秘密投票，禁止按名選舉，黨員可以無限制批評攻擊候選人，按期召集市區黨部積極工作人員會議·因爲黨的首要組織任務，是幹部的正確選擇，及決議案實施狀况的考察，齊氏報吿中文建議於聯共中委會下設立幹部廳，於省及區域黨委會，各民族共和國黨中央委員會以及市及區委員會下設立幹部。</p>
<p>增設宣傅鼓動聽</p>
<p>爲提高黨的宣傳及鼓動工作達到正當水準起見，報吿建議於聯共中央委員會下設宣傳鼓動廳，省及區黨委員會各民族共和國黨中央委員會以及市及區委員會下，設立宣傳鼓動部·</p>
<p>因爲黨與國家生活步調加速，幷爲及時解决黨的政策方面緊急問題起見，報吿提議每年至少召集全聯邦地方黨部代表全體會議一次，幷賦予該會議以召囘中央委員會中不能切實執行責任的委員，而改推其他委員代替的權利，惟人數不能超過黨代表大會選出中委人數五分之一以上，上述曾議的决定，除改推中委一項以外，都要　過中央委員會核准。</p>
<p>黨部監察生產機關</p>
<p>因爲黨部的基本組織，巳日益强固，與實際行政及文化的工作的關係亦日益密切，齊氏報吿又建議：爲加强各基本組織，在各生產機關，包括國營及集體農塲，內部的地位及增進其對各該機關的負責程度起見，要賦予以該組織以監察各該機關行政組織之工作的權利，各人民委員會中黨部組織，因蘇維埃機關的特殊工作條件，不能實施監察的，必須將各該人民委員會及內中各個員司工作上的缺乏，通知黨中央委員會及各　民委員會之領導工作人員。</p>
<p>提拔新工作幹部</p>
<p>又爲造成提拔新工作幹部任黨內領導工作條件起見，報吿建議，規定省及區域委員會及民跌共和國中央委員會書記的最低在黨履歷爲五年以上，（前此爲十二年）各下級黨部書記之最低在黨履歷亦要相應減低。</p>
<p>結語　當法西斯侵略者加緊推進進攻英美法等民主和平及家，而實行其重新劃分世界的大戰的時候，他們爲要破壞蘇聯的和平外交政策，破壞蘇聯民主和平各國及全世界正義人士中間日益增長的威信，破壞民主糾平各國與蘇聯保持密切聯系起見，他們會經不惜耗費鉅額的金錢和人力，淮行對於蘇聯外交政策尤其是內部情况的造謠詆毀運動。然而我們從上述莫洛托夫氏關於第三個五年計劃的報吿，巳可看到蘇聯及聯邦全民衆，其經濟上，文化，日常生活上的空前進步與勝利，這種進步與勝利還在急速度的發展，　我們在這里應知資本主義各國及其民衆，尤其是法西斯侵略者控制下的日德意各國及其民衆，其經濟情况，其物質上文化上生活情况，則相反的是空前的退步與貧困—）同時。我們從本屆大會上將由齊達諾夫氏報吿的「修正黨章案綱要」，則更可見蘇聯民衆政治地位的提高，全蘇維埃聯邦飛躍的進步，這種進步的本身就是一種無敵的力量，它沉默無言地粉碎了法西斯主義國外國資本家對於蘇聯的造謠，它史將沉默無言地增漲了，它在全世界勞動大衆和正義前進　士中間的威信，而克盡其爲全世和平與文化的最忠誠最堅强的衛士的任務。</p>

<p>【車慶通訊】出征軍人的家庭是抗戰中國最光榮之家，它的光榮，猶如科舉時代有子弟中了狀元或進士……一般·山城裏熱騰騰景象，就是「光榮之家』榮光的輻射與普照。</p>
<p>馬路上招待汽車昂揚的嗚嗚地在疾駛，龍燈與樂隊在繁鬧的地方奏演着，尤其値得重視的是大樑子一圍舉行了一個盛大的「招待出征軍人家屬遊藝會」·三點多鐘那會塲裏巳經擠滿了人，二樓三樓也人頭密密地，這樣總有二三千人，男的女的老的少的，一個個强健的面孔，浮起慰安與勝利的微笑，象　着征人的安康與快樂·</p>
<p>這時記者訪問了六十歲　翁蔣雲程，五十歲的雷老太，奇怪，他們都異口同聲地吿訴我，他們孩兒應徵出征都是出於自動的投效，蔣平貴祗十八歲，入伍巳一年多了，他是一位愛國而又孝順的孩于，他給蔣老爹的信說：「羊跪乳，鳥反哺，爲人于者能不如禽獸乎？故已節下餉金二十元充甘旨之用·」蔣老爹吿訴我平貴在家撑小船爲業，後因開駛洋船，生意衰落，故自投軍營，參加殺×，一方面救國，一方也幫助了家用。雷老太的孩子離家應徵的時候，沒有得到母親的允許，老母親忽然發覺兒子失蹤，着急起來，但後來就知道他一定投軍去了，因為他會告國訴母親：「如果我們不去殺推日本××，中國是要被滅亡的』</p>
<p>偉大的中華民族呀！誰說他還是一睡獅」？</p>
<p>三點半鐘光景，各長官葉禁傖，邵力子，呂超，蔣夫人代表史良，洪蘭友各界領袖胡文瀾温少鶴等在主席台領導着舉行了開會的儀式，由政治部陳誠部長主席並致慰問詞，他因爲連續不斷地開會，他的喉嚨巳經喊啞了，然而，他仍提着子他說：日本××的帝國主義者，在數十年來，就處心積愿，想滅亡中國，想把我們的人民做他們的奴隸牛馬，我們的最高領袖深知日本兇狠的毒計，所以毅然决然發動了抗戰，這次的抗戰，應該是我們全民族的責任，我們要抗戰一定要有優良的軍隊，優良的軍隊是由我們優良的民衆組成的，現在戰事巳一年多了，……人已經給我們打得沒法應付了，但我們愈打愈强，最後勝利的獲得，一定是有絕對的把握的，這也就是你們的子弟夫婿的功績，光榮—親愛的軍人家屬們。我要吿訴你們的子弟夫婿在前方，生活極好，而且很安寗，我是從前方來的，我總覺前方比後方好，我看見前方的兄弟們，臉孔身體很結實强壯·而且政府對你們的子弟夫婿很是關懷，所以巳經决定了優待出征軍人家屬的辦法，成立了一個出征軍人慰勞會，擬定慰勞辨法，每一出征軍人家屬發穀兩担，就是析錢十五元，以後每三個月發一次，重慶方面是由社會局經辦的，如果發現有保甲長虐待作弊可以報吿政府究辦。最後有一點就是我們現在的抗戰，和保衛我們的家鄕有直接關係，我們現在大家去殺日本人。使他不能來四川，否則大家不動手，日本人是可以殺到我們四川來的，也可以用狠毒的獸行，像下江人所受到慘遇一般來殺害我們的父母子弟，××我們的諸姑姊妹的。渦去一般的同胞以當兵爲苦事，現在巳不　樣了，有些地方，老百姓爭先恐後自已願意投效當兵，祗要大家一致起來，×盡日本××、我們的民族就有生路了。』陳部長講完後又由胡文瀾温少鶴致詞、大意說「抗戰出征家屬是頂光榮的人物、所以我們應尊敬抗戰軍人、也尊敬抗戰軍人的家屬，今後更加要發揮這意義，使投軍的人愈多，勝利也可愈快愈大了。蔣夫人代表史良也勉勵婦女界的同胞，要鼓勵丈夫或兒子哥哥弟弟們去殺×，蔣夫人一定用全副精神設法安慰我們前方將士，使他們的家屬有工可做，子弟有書可讀，現在重慶正籌辦軍人家屬工廠。將來成立，希望大家踴躍參加，最後由車人家屬張明婁，羅仁齋等致答詞，一面感謝當局的關切，一面興會地慰安着征人的欣愉，他們一致地認爲這是國民的天　「國家興亡，匹夫有責，一前方的勝利就是後　的快樂。而且我們有子弟在前方殺×，實在是光榮的事等語。</p>

<p>— 宋美齡</p>
<p>——在渝紀念會致詞原文——</p>
<p>【中央社重慶八日電】蔣夫人宋美齡女士、在「三八』節紀念會致詞、原文錄次、</p>
<p>各位同胞、今天我們開會紀念「三八節」、這個「三八節」、决定爲國際婦女節、是一九零九年在丹　京城開會時所决定的、到今天恰恰卅年了、所以今天是「三八節」的卅週年紀念日、我們華民國的婦女們、在××侵略、國家　苦的今天、在一面抗戰、一面建國的今天、來舉行這一個重要的紀念、我們每一個八的心中、必然有一種特殊的感想、「三八節』的意義、正如各位所得知、是在求得女子的解放、但是所謂『女子解放」、不　是解放了就算了、是須由我們女界同胞的努力、增進我們民族的地位、要使民族生活受到女子的影響、因而提高它的精神物質兩方面的標準、使大多數乃至全體的同胞、都得到獨立自由平等的幸福、我們要認識、女子解放、不能單單作一種權利看、應該當作一種責任來看、我們爲什麽要求女子解放、爲的是要負起我們女子的責任、換一句話說、我們要眞正求得女子的解放、首先就要我們先能負起責任、我們總理孫先生在民國十三年演　、有幾句很重要的話、他說『革命不能成功的原因、就是個人爭自由、忘記了國家的自由、要曉得國家沒有自由、個人就不能自由」這是十分眞確的道理、我們須要解放、也要曉得國家沒有解放我們全國的女子、就不得到眞正的解放、我們國家今天受×人這樣的欺侮侵略、整個民族處在暴力的軍壓之下，全國同胞、流　痛苦、我們不先把　個危急的國家扶救起來、我們四萬五千萬男女、都要做亡國的奴　、更從何處談女子的解放、更向何人去要求女子的解放、</p>
<p>我常常說、女子解放、要看我們女子本身的努力、如果我們女子的知識能力、有不斷的進步、我們女子對于國家民族和世界人類、的有確實的貢献、女子的地位、就自然而然的提高現在或者有人以爲女子參與政治、是求得女子解放的第一步這句話也許是對的、現代的國家、都不能否認女子要有參政權、可是女　解放眞正的意義、並不是祇求得女界少數入得到政治上和經濟上的地位、乃是姿解放大多數婦女痛苦、改善大多數婦女同胞的生活、從敎育和組織着手、來增進婦女的能力、提高婦女的地位、而且實　說來、只講婦女解放還不够、過要用我們婦女的力量、來達到全民族同胞的解放、纔算盡了我們的責任、</p>
<p>今天到會的許多婦女團　的代表、有知識界的婦女、有職業界的婦女、也有勞動界的婦女、我們這些人、在幾千萬女同胞中、算是此較有能力、有地泣的、雖不能說是先知先覺、至少是在水平以上、我們得想想、我們該怎麽樣纔不辜負我們自身的知識與能力呢、我們該怎麽樣纔不辜負我們所受的敎育和訓練呢、我們該怎麽樣、纔對得起我們的國家民族和我們所處時代呢、尤其重要的、我們這許多婦女團體、該拿怎麽樣的態度、來對一般同胞有所貢献呢、</p>
<p>我舉一個故事來吿訴大家、記得荷蘭女皇維　海娜幼小的時候、他的父親巳經去世了、有一天過十歲的生日、她的母親爲她舉行慶賀、就有成千成萬的男女民衆、到皇宮外來祝賀他、幼年的女皇、看見這種熱烈的景象、高興極了、感動極了就向她的母親說、「這些民衆、是不是屬于我們的呢』、她的母親說、「不是的、不是他們屬於你的、而是你屬於他們的、』我願今天到會的女同胞們、也要認識、我們是屬於民衆的、不是民衆屬于我們的、我們做一切活動的時候、切不可自認爲我們可以支配民衆、而要自認爲民衆　役、我們要接近民衆、深入民衆中間、誠心　釁的爲同胞服務、去敎育他們、援助他們、救濟他們的痛苦、創造他們的幸福</p>
<p>在現在這個非常時期、國家和國民的禍福利害、是一致的、我們若不能求得抗戰勝利、我們民族就不能生存、我們建國若不成功、我們個人就沒有一些幸福、今天我們的女界同胞、各人都要量自已知識能力的大小、定責任的輕重、誰的知識能力越大、責任就越重、我們要有熱情、有毅力、有辦法、更要有組織、去担任種種有關抗戰的工作、我們要提倡節約、勸導生產、推進社會教育、主持救濟事業、鼓勵從軍殺×、協助抗戰宣傳、（未完）</p>

<p>— 常人</p>
<p>【本報桂林航訊】二十世紀四十年代的運輸，論空間，巳由水陸發展到天空；論　間，則交通工具已進步到了人體難能忍受的時速，但因爲愈速則載重　輕，愈速則需費愈大的兩個反比例的原則，到目下爲止，大部分的運輸還是向戰重和省　兩方面去求發展。譬如汽車在戰重和速率上固不失爲完美的工具；但二十汽車所載的物品。只需一輛鈇蓬車便可戰運。同樣兩百個甚至四百個八百個汽車駕駛員才能够載運的貨物，只要兩三個大車司機人便能運動。諸如此類，火車的運費便較汽車的　廉多了．反之：假如一列火車所載運的物品，在時間上允許利用航運，那麽就是用一百　輪船或一千　帆給來運輪，在運費上仍能求得低廉。世界各國對　運的競爭，這也是原因之一、</p>
<p>運輸在戰時的重要性是誰都知道的．戰爭的目的在爭奪　間和空間，　輸使是這種爭奪的一種手段。我國自抗戰以來，在這方面所受的敎訓巳經不少，同時也無時不在力求彌補這一方面的缺陷。我國的航空運輸當正在發　時期，就遇到戰事的打擊，到現在雖還在×人優勢空軍的威脅下，力圖發展，航綫　竟　縮短不少·抗戰進入第二期後，鐵道運輸也因鐵道綫的續被佔領，也大大的减縮了能力　今後的運　幾乎百分之八十以上要　求汽車運輸。在我們還不能自製汽車，不能自煉汽油的現在，軍事和經濟上都受到相當的影響。譬如從昆明運一車軍火到長沙，據一個管理汽車運輸的人員說：「一輛載重汽車的三分之一地位得裝載汽油；而且因爲公路不能如想像中的完美，一輛載重汽車的三分之一的　命也由此减短。從這一現象來推測其他，那麼我們在這一期的抗戰中，在汽車運輸上的消耗，一定非常可　。</p>
<p>軍事當局早就顧　到這一端。東戰場，魯南戰塲，長江兩岸各戰役中，除了儘可能運用鐵道和公路外，對水路更充分利用。並玆料及戰局的發展必將　入長江中游和珠江下游；同時湘南廣西勢必爲我軍必戰，必守，的必勝的所在；所以從去年上半年起，就授命場子江水利委員會開始籌劃進行整理湘桂水道的工程，希望把這地理上不多見的水道，像大　河的貫穿着海河，黃河和長江一般，把長江和珠江「工」字形的溝通起來，把華中的武漢三鎮和華南廣州連繫起來，以補償鐵道和公路運輸的不足　損耗，增加軍事和民運的便捷·</p>
<p>湘桂水道北起長沙，南達桂江西江合流地的蒼梧，全長在一千公里以上，幾乎是湘江，離水和桂江三條河流的全長總和。這水道流域的交通狀况，大部和江　吳縣（蘇州）與浙江嘉興間的運河流域一樣，有平行的鐵道綫公路綫和水道　互交　。湘江和離水同發源於廣西北部的興安山地，南北分流，其中有一脈可通。湘江在衡陽以上，僅可通行民船，衛陽長沙間，春夏水漲時有小汽輪航行；長沙以下，終無通行江輪離水是從興安經桂林到　樂的一段水道。桂林以上，水枯時很少舟揖之利：桂林平樂間，最深處不過四五尺，淺處則　一二尺，河面寬處約半里，窄處四五丈，徒步可涉，所以每年僅有兩月可通電船，餘時通民船。平樂蒼　間的水道稱桂江，水道漸寬且深，因爲淺灘比離水更多，所以全年也只有四個月可通電船。</p>
<p>從以上的說明，可以知道湘桂水道工程，衡陽以迄平樂的一段最爲艱鉅，尤其是作爲分水嶺的興安附近，水道都還是天然狀况，和經過人工疏導約束的長江大河不同，因此得以治河的「渠化」和「治理」來兼　並用。</p>
<p>揚子江水利委員會　統下的湘桂水道工程處，在去年九月一日成立，處長是張含英。九月下旬正式工作，因爲適應第二期的迫切需要，同時又因工程材料，混擬土，　筋鋼板等應　先供給軍用的緣故，不能從事根本的工作。去年五月間尙開始測量的桂林全縣　—就是興安分水嶺南北附近的水道——一百五十公里的一控制段」，也以態作局部的改進：增加低水時的航道水深至八公寸，（約合二尺餘）·使一方能減短運輸時間，一方能增加水　重量。至於離水自桂林以上均須築閘，浚深　道，以便工作完畢後，再繼續實施了。</p>
<p>桂林以北的大榕江到以南的大墟之局部改進工程，現正在進行中。這裏面包括疏濬航道，導流，按設絞關，炸除礁石等四項工程。可惜因爲工人不易召集，朱能大舉興工。但在今　四月底以前，仍可有二十多處工程可以完成。五月初到九月底，是漲水期，來年度的工作將在十月間開始。這一段的工程，希望能於明年上半年完成。</p>
<p>湘桂水道工程的目的不單是溝通長江和珠江，爲內陸航運開闢一新紀元；它更大的作用還具有聯絡國際內河航運的使命。西江上游的主流，自蒼梧到桂平稱潯江，自桂平到邕寧（南寗）以西稱鬱江，自　寧以西迄龍　稱麗江（左江）·麗江的發源地，一是桂　邊區。經平孟隘附近流入法屬安南，至水口關附近復入國境：一是安南境內的集溪，由平南翻附近流入國境，就在龍津合流。龍津以上的河道，雖很少航運的便利；但龍津是湘桂鐵路延長線最南的大城，距安南僅五十餘公里·假如在這一方面的水道工程一　完成·我國西南國際運輸勢必再爲改觀：同時，對我國四大巨流之一的珠江，亦將從新估計它的價値了、</p>

<p>美海軍作戰部長李希大將於七日針對日本宣佈六年內擴大海軍一事發表談話，稱「如有外國在物質上加强其海軍實力者，美國海軍亦當有增强其實力之必要。』這是明白表示美國抵抗日本的决心。同日美參院以絕對數多連過政府所提七千二百萬鎊陸軍擴軍案，並通過准予陸軍飛機增至六千架一案。這裏更表明美國政府在法西斯侵略者加緊冒險政策之際，巳經確定其以實力應付的决心。對于若干民主和平國家之繼續以妥協退讓妄冀和平的盲動，可作强烈的對照與諷勸。不過「成功的抵抗，不能孤立進行』，因此美英美蘇在反侵略戰爭的必要上的合作，實應爲當前緊急的國際任務。美國前任國務卿史汀生氏前日號召美英法等民主國家團結抵抗侵略國家，可爲當前最緊急的也是最台人道的號召·</p>

<p>日來日本以漁區問題加緊對蘇聯挑釁，以及蘇聯對於日本使略者絕端强硬的態度，引起國際關於遠東大戰的憂慮。</p>
<p>日本新的挑釁，用意顯然只是製造嚴重空氣，一以對內緩和人民反戰情緒，一以對外響應意德以至詐惑英法·蘇聯的强硬態度，則不僅不會促進遠東大戰，而且足以制止這種戰爭的擴大。日本在蘇聯這種强硬態度下不敢冒險，將是意料由。</p>
<p>因此我們對于蘇日關係日趨緊張，應該注意的是：一日本對蘇聯挑釁，一面將是對華更大進攻的初步，一面又將實際上加緊西南攻略，而從國際方面及漢奸份子的活動，以圖實現停止我國的抗戰！二，蘇聯的强硬，足以表示蘇聯『不威脅他國亦不受威脅』的態度，有其雄厚實力後盾，而對于我國抗戰，則有其甚大的協助的意義</p>
<h3 id="c35">日本財政的危機 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 世長譯　原著者Kurt　Bloch載二月號亞美雜誌</p>
<p>誰都知道，中日戰爭的發生，長由於日本的侵略，因爲日本不願中國向統一和團結的大道邁進，所以發動了這次破壞性的戰爭。戰爭一天一天的擴大和延長以後以我，我們可以很明顯的看到，日本不是單獨的在和中國作戰，同時也向列强在華的權益鬥爭。慕尼黑會讓以後，捷克的分裂。使日本的使略工作得到不小的鼓勵，所以，主張與英，美維待友好的日外相宇垣，得不到軍部的擁護，被迫下台，而由在一九三八年四月卽公開主張廢除「門戶開放」的有田繼任。不久日本卽開始進攻廣州，威脅香港，所以，上年十月六日，美政府向日本提出維護『門戶開放」的牒文，並不是偶然的；當然，日本的答覆仍是含糊其詞，可是，據日本半官方的論調，巳經明顯的表示，日本有獨佔中國的意向。</p>
<p>這種對於列强權益的威脅，不可謂不嚴重，自蘆溝橋事件引起戰爭以來，日本借手於「滿洲國」，從德國方面，得到不少借狄。據一般的估計，惜款數額至少约爲四千五百萬美金，很顯而易見的，這是一種戰債。當然，德國方面因此得享受若干優　　和特殊權利益；南滿鐵路的日本駐德代表，也切實允諾德，意在華的特權，可是，德國因爲準備大規模的歐洲戰爭，經濟商業的情形，日　　洛，出口的能力，也巳大大的减少了·</p>
<p>南滿鐵路近來曾經同美國要求鐵路設備借款二千另五十萬美金，但是，沒有獲得成功。還有，滿洲實業公司總經理也啓程到美國，希望得到美國製造家的合作，而發展滿洲的汽車，鋼，鉄和煤等事業，這都是軍用性質的工業。汽車工業可以使日本軍隊機械化，鋼鈇工業的發展，可以使日本不必向美國購買，滿洲煤礦的開發。也可以救濟日本的煤荒。但是，日本的消耗非常鉅大，而且，滿洲的各種事業，也顯然的呈不穩固的現象，所以，這事是很少成功希望的。相反的·正當日本向美借狄失敗的時候，美國復興銀行公司管轄下的華盛頓進出口銀行，允許中國大量信用借軟，計美金二千五百萬元，以美國的農產品和工業品。交換中國的桐油（桐油是美國汽車工業所需的快乾油漆的一種重要原料）·同樣的，英政府採取了「平行行動」，由出口信用担保局貸華五十萬　。以發展緬甸和中國間的貿易和交通。數犬以後，美國財政部長宣言，中國政府有大量金準備存於美國、作爲担保，美政府準備擴充對華的借欵。</p>
<p>當然的，日本嚴厲　擊英，美對華貸款的舉動，日外相有田批評尖國對華的貸狄說：「這是美國不適當的舉動，美國各報認爲美國反對日本，所以採取這種政治的態度；我想這是極端危險的態度，日本可以認爲這是對於日本的一種經濟壓力，美國預期的結果是不會實現的」·同時，他更聲言，在華的外國租界和治外法權，應該一律廢除，外商的經濟活動也應受到若干限制。</p>
<p>正在那個時候，日本控制下的北平、南京、漢口和廣州各地僞政府，舉行一次聯席會議，討論抗議英，美貸款中國的舉動，和攷慮採取報復的手段。日軍發言人曾經非正式的表示，這種貸狄不過使行將結束的戰事，延長至夏天而巳，其效力是不大的。這種表示，有趣得很，恰巧針對日本對華政策的宣言，好像默認到了一九三力年夏天的時候，日本的經濟和財政情况，必定將近於崩潰，决不能戰勝中國了，在另一方面，軍事專家一致的相信，華軍　移內地，保持實力，日本的重砲和機械化部隊漸漸的失效，在這種情形下，日本是不能獲得勝利的。近來時局的變遷，英，美動搖不定的態度，也巳逐漸堅强，决定在財政上援助中國，和德國在財政上的援助日本，可以抗衡了。這在中國方面，自然是感覺欣慰的。從英，美方面看來，這也沒有奇異的地方，中日戰爭開始以前不久，英國出口信用担保局，在上海設立一特別辦事處，以推進，英中間的貿易·美國的華盛頓進出口銀行，差不多也在這個時候，第一次允許中國方面的借款，以鐵路機車二十輛售予中國鐵道部。所以，英，美現在貸欵中國，不過是繼續一九三七年的經濟政策而已。</p>
<p>東亞的情勢巳經有新發展了，英美兩國重新囘到一九三七年的經濟政策·是很重要的·一九三七平，英美貸欵中國，因爲當時它們想中國是一個人力富强，軍備不佳的國家，希望在財政上予以援助以後，可以漸漸興盛起來，成爲一个極好的市塲，但是。在一九三八年終了的時候，英美對于日本和中國的見解，有了劇烈的改變，一年半的戰爭証明，中國的車備，幷不像它們在一九三七年所想像的那　柔弱，同樣的，一年半的戰爭也訨明，日本的軍備並不像它自已誇　的那麼强大，更不能建立東亞的新秩序。反之，日本的軍官都沒有豐　的軍事學識和經濟，連親日的德國也嚴　的批評日軍：政治方面的情形，也是這樣，目前中國淪陷區的政治，比較中國歷史上任何時期，還要黑暗和擾亂，很不幸的，迷夢的日本領袖沒有看淸這種事實，沒有發現可怕的日本危機，這就是它屢次激怒列强，反一對自己的理由·</p>
<p>一九三八年四月，有田曾嚴峻的反對『門戶開放」政策，他就任外相以後，仍　沒有改變意見，雖然作語氣方面，是稍爲緩和一些。另一方面，在華的日本軍事領袖所宣佈的「勝利」祇能獲得中國　土上的殘餘濟滓，以供給友好的德，意，和日本控制下的企業。同時，更竭力驅逐外國的工商業，西方國家巳經發覺對華貿易自由和商業利益的發展，祇有從中國的中央政府方面可以得到，這種情形是由日本造成，日人大可以自責自萬的。</p>
<p>美幽的對華借欵，是基於它歷史久長的傳統外交政策，美國對華常常是友好的，在華的美敎會也不時援助中國。一九三一年揚子江的大水災，美國農本局會已一千五百萬　小夢貸予中國，一九三三年宋子文氏於出席倫敦世界經濟會議後，抵達美國，獲得了五千萬美金的棉麥借　，一九三三到一九三四年，中國從美國方面得到借　一千七百萬元，成立了「中國經齊委員會一。一九三六年美國白銀政策，相當的影響中國財政；美國繼續購買白一銀，切實援助中國鞏固貨幣的基礎，當美國進口銀行批准以機車貸華的時候，中國財長孔祥熈氏和美財長一致同意，中國向美購買實質黃金，所以這次以中國銀行負担保的美國新借狄，互相會換中美兩國的貨物，是不足爲奇的。</p>
<p>這是顯而易見的，中國得到新借款，日本表示大大的失望，自從慕尼黑會議後，法西斯三國集團以爲可以橫行全球了；可是，事實巳經明明白白的吿訴日本，英美巳經在財政上支持中國，控制全中國之迷夢，是萬難實現的；而且，中國更可在蘇聯方面獲得切實援助，同時，日軍自從攻陷廣州和漢口以後，毫無新的發展，廣州更時常受到精銳華軍反攻的威脅，對於贛，相兩省的進攻，也已經停頓；　次楊　進攻中國西本，切斷中蘇交通聯絡的企　，早已失敗，在經濟上，開發中國資源的結果，祇不過增加一重失望，因為中國的農民和工人都在拒絕合作，在「滿洲國」方面，人力的缺乏，極爲明顯，地方的和平，不能維持，時常受到八路軍的威脅——這種種都阻止滿洲的發展。至於在日本本部，戰爭巳經帶給人民不能容忍的艱苦，神秘的大火和爆炸可以令我們相信，日本的「靜默民衆」是不能永遠的保守靜默了。</p>
<p>目前是中國獲得財政上援助的最好時機，也是列強援　的最好時機，日本急於需要在本年夏天以前得到勝利，巳經漸　的感覺不安了；因爲「中國事件一將延畏下去，較日本財政力量所能支持的時期長得多，英美對華的借　，無論是　於商業性質，或是政抬性質，對於日本，實在是一个不小的日擊·</p>

<p>— 蔭霞</p>
<p>一個創香港婦女運動紀錄的熱鬧場面</p>
<p>在抗戰轉入了更艱困的階段，「三八」國際婦女節，又翩然降臨，爲了加緊喚醒全港谷階層的婦女，踏上自由解放的大道，全香港的四十幾個婦女團體，都團結在一塊兒，籌　擴大分　舉行這一個婦女解放的節日。紀念大會，在利舞臺舉行，中國婦女領袖，和全香港的婦女領袖，都匯流在一起，濟濟一堂，熱鬧的情况，替香港婦女運動創造了一員有史以來的新紀錄。</p>
<p>是一個晴朗的上午，渣甸畔的利舞　　中水馬　，穿着　色校衣的女學生，穿着簇新土布衣服　女工披　花紅紫綠各色　袍的婦女領袖，團體代表，一串一　的　　　　　，沒多時，二樓，大堂，巳經黑壓壓地擠滿人了·</p>
<p>肅立默哀，開會的儀式，一項一項的過去，繼着由主席何玉英女士致開會詞，一個個子不高的中年婦人，　着莊重柔和的態度登場，她用流利爽朗的口吻先叙述了三八國際婦女節的起緣，和提出保障婦女權利，提高婦女地位的「八三一婦女節的兩個大目的。跟着她展述着世界戰爭風雲是這樣的險惡，全世界各國的婦女們，都應該積　起來，擁護公理，提倡和平，和克己服務。如果世界佔着人類一半數的世界婦女，能够這樣做，人類互相大屠殺的日子，或者可以避免的。</p>
<p>說到香港婦女的地位，她認爲巳經提高很多了，同時在抗戰展開，香港婦女們更能聯絡起來，做着献金，捐助醫藥，　育孤兒，種種救亡的運動，這是香港婦女界的一個好現象，「不過，那還是不够的！」她加重點聲說着，「我們更應該深切的認識抗戰時期，就是婦女謀解放的機會，因之我們就更要刻苦，和犧牲。我們在　抗戰的大時代裏，能與男子同甘苦，共患難，將來在新中國當中，我們一定能够和男子同享榮耀，同享權利的」她一口氣說完了，在不斷的掌聲中送她坐下來！</p>
<p>跟着是何香凝女士演講，她是中國婦女解放運動中的一員前驅的戰士，巳經用不看我們怎樣加以介紹。她年紀雖然那麽樣大，頭髮也花斑人了，但她的亮晶晶的限，她　活的嘴，她奮鬥的精神，沒有一處不是表現着靑春的活力的。她移步到　前，首先談起「三八」婦女節在中國的歷史，跟着她說，「我們在爲陣亡將士及罹難同胞　念三分鐘的時候，在那　　的一刹部中，我們想起我們在淪陷區　的姊妹，××××××××××××××，我們覺得　限傷心，無限悲痛，我們要立着决心，爲他們仲雪恥辱，×××××！」她說這幾句話時，太用力了，你看過一个武十在生死存亡的關頭　書了他的×人時的緊張情况嗎？「×××」！塲裏的人，全都熱血奔流，怒髪直豎了！</p>
<p>講到我們婦女應該努力鬥爭，她輕輕舒了口氣說？「我們誠然要爭取我們和男子的平等地位，但這祗是個人的享受，爲的祇是私利，我們如果要達到我們的自由平等解决，就先要取得國家民族的自由年等解放·」一陣熱烈的掌聲，打斷她的話頭：「希望今日在座各位，尤其是學生們要積極的宣傳，喚醒全港盼婦女，更推而廣之喚醒全國的婦文，起來爭取國家民族的目由平等！「她用力的說，興奮得手也抖素起來了。</p>
<p>談到僑居香港的婦女，她用悲凉的語調說：「僑居在香港的婦女，雖然隔離祖國那麽近，　慘的事實，差不多可以耳聞目見，但我所知到的，現在不少婦女還日夕沉溺在享樂，享樂啊！說了這句話會場裏很多人都左顧右盼，像在搜尋甚麼似的，其實有些人已經臉紅紅了。在冷靜的空氣中，她繼續說着：「希　大家都能及時覺醒，把這種有用的　錢，來救濟苦　的同胞，和貢献給國家」。</p>
<p>「國家興亡，匹夫匹婦皆有責任，」當婦女的責任，可以說比男子的責任更重大，這是怎麼樣說法呢？假如全國的男子都　牲殆盡，我們後方的女子，二樣也需要到前線去作戰，我伯想在十人之中，平均一人懷孕，那鼓幾年後就多添了，幾十萬的戰士阿！「一陣輕中鬆的笑志，截斷她的話，頓了一頓，她繼續着說「希望女同胞們，起來奮鬥阿！』掌聲激烈得像新年的燒爆竹，場內的人差不多要感動的熱淚幷出了。</p>
<p>演說完了，繼續是報吿通電給國民政府和軍事委員會委員長，場上各人，一熱烈的鼓掌擁護，這時何香凝女士，站起身來，跑到擴音　前，大聲的喊着，「就從今天起，全港舞術紀念八三節的各婦女團體，組成全港婦女救國大聯會好嗎？」好！又是一陣熱烈的掌聲！</p>
<p>在何香凝女士演說當中，孫總理夫人宋慶齡女士悄悄地降臨了，幾千　眼睛都射在她的身上，好像她的身上有着奇珍　寶一樣，她非常謙遜的坐在第三排椅子上，經不起各人的惇惇　請，她　於登台坐下了，這天她穿着玄色旗袍，蔴絨的大衣，顯出她那沉着的莊重，和人談，老是笑着，露出她那雪白的牙齒，態度是那麽樣的温柔和藹，一談一吐都在活現出她的堅毅的的活力，她給我們的印象是崇高的，是和靄的，是偉大的，是卓越的，</p>
<p>記者請她對香港婦女述動發表一點意見，她遲疑了一會說纔說；關於這些明天她有篇文章發表，所以沒有甚麽意見啊！事實上她在會　上也沒有說過多少說，因爲她是不尙多言的啊！僅在贈贈旗給三婦女會時她簡單地說：「在美英法　會時五婦女團體靜聯結起能够發揮了她很大的工作効律啊！」雖然這祗是零零幾句說話，但語重心長全港的婦女團衛敎亡團體實在需要團結起來而奮鬥啊！</p>
<p>頒獎獎品完畢紀念的儀式便吿完成，跟着便是游　，獨幕劇一中華兒女」，是由廣東戲協會，留港同人會担任演出的成績和效果那很美滿。孫夫人和　夫人一千人也留眞有戲凑熱鬧，劇完塲散，於是這個紀念三八大會，便吿終了蔡魯生</p>
<h3 id="c45">「三八」節在鴨眯洲　大眾婦女空前的大集會 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡魯生</p>
<p>昨天，本港的婦女團體，共分五區同時熱烈而隆重地舉行紀念全世界的婦女們爲了要求自由解放的偉大紀念日——「國際婦女節」。筆者所參加的，是離開香港中心區約半小時「巴士」路程的香港三大漁區之一——省港仔對海鴨脷洲的紀念會。由於是會的普遍化與大衆化，在這文化落後的漁區裏，是給予人們以無限的興　的！</p>
<p>該會是由漁民與小販等的大衆婦女，配台着智識婦女而組成的「鴨脷洲婦女團」所主催。會場在一個週遭被漁民們晾滿着很多海產的矌塲上；塲的南部，蓋搭着一座竹蓬的大台，台下整齊地列着一排一排的長坐椅。檯上除了懸着應有的黨國旗和總理還像之外，台下還滿掛着五光十色的各種標語，如：「紀念三八節不要忘記前方千萬婦女被×軍蹂躪；後方千萬婦女爲×機轟炸！」「對於抗戰建國的工作，我們嬰和男子共同努力！」「少買一些化粧品，便可增加一些國力！』等等，那是多麼發人深省的語句啊！</p>
<p>因爲會場是在露天的曠場上，所以無論什麽人都可以有機會來參加，未屆開會的時間，就己經黑壓壓地擠滿着人——其中有一向被人們所「歧視」的「蛋家婆」和小販，商人，智識份子；亦有高貴的太太小姐們，這在向來是荒僻冷落的鴨脷洲，不能不算是一個盛大而空前的婦女集會！</p>
<p>上午十時餘，大會就揭幕了，依儀行禮後，卽由主席余鳳寧女士致開會詞——對「八三」節的歷史和意義，加以精闢而詳細的申述·得到了不少熱烈的掌聲，隨着，就是代表「三八」籌備會前來參加的陳　雲女士，演講抗戰二十個來月，國內在軍事上政治上的進步，和國際情勢的好轉；再次就是婦女處在今日的地位，應如何而使自己做一個「人」，和男子共同担負這抗戰的神聖任務。她並勉勵大家應該學游擊隊的母親趙老太太那樣的英勇，爲婦女的解放和民族的解放而鬥爭！更博到了聽衆熱狂的鼓掌。</p>
<p>在其他的幾位婦女代表，也相繼發揮她們的意見之後，游藝跟着開始了。首先是生活合唱團婦女組的歌詠：「大軍進行」，「我們需要戰爭」……等，全場充溢　慷慨激越的　聲，很使大　動容。接着就是鴨脷洲婦女團的表演，獨幕劇「自由？」，由是大會主席余鳳寧女士及婦女團主幹吳倩卿女土等合演，吳女士反串男角，雖然雌雄不辨，而惹得許多天眞質樸的漁人們，捧肚大笑，但效果却是很好的，第三個節目是該團鄭敏提諸女士演出的「女性的吶喊」，表演非常賣力。第四個節目是長城謠的象　表演，因爲演出的眞切，不但演者哭成淚人兒許多觀眾——尤其是婦女們，都被感動得熱淚交流，而紛紛把「亳只」「先士」拋到台上去。還有其餘不少可觀的節　，這裏因篇幅關係，不能儘量記錄下來。總之，這會的舉行，巳使鴨脷洲的婦女們——尤其是貧窮階層的婦女們，開始從黑暗中醒覺過來了，她們在不久的將來將必能在事實上來證明她們如何跟踪這偉大的三八婦女運動，而去爭取做一個」人——一個能和男子們共同担當選民族自由解放門爭的健全的「人」！</p>

<h3 id="c51">潮的糧食問題 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 張問强</p>
<p>潮汕的糧食生產不數潮汕人民的食用，不敷之額，向來從閩南與長江流域各省的國米以及安兩，暹羅，仰光等處的　米運來供給。故在抗戰發生以前潮汕因地　海濱，交通便利，無論本地收成，歉如何，外米供給從無斷絕之　，只有米貴、絕無米荒。然而，自抗戰軍興以來，尤其在武　放棄，廣州淪　以後，潮汕與國內產米之區的交通綫，除閩南一隅外，已被敵人截斷，　米運入潮汕，異常困難，各處洋米則因國幣相對落價，以外幣計　之成本因而暴漲，運銷國內，價格太昂，商人無　可圖，進口幾乎絕跡。所以在三個月以前，潮汕雖在冬收不久之後，米價卽空前昂　，每元僅　得六七斤左右。貧民負担加重，生活困難，己足以削弱抗戰的力量，今後更有米　之處，倘民食一吿斷絕，潮汕的自　力量，甚至抗戰的全局　將受其影嚮。潮汕的糧食問題實是　常嚴重，値得大家注意研究，設法解决的。</p>
<p>目前潮汕的糧食問題，只有米貴的現象，尙未演成米荒的程度。平抑米價，解除人民痛苦，固爲民衆迫切之要求，如何防止米荒，更是與「足兵」幷重的「足食」問題，在敵人南侵的政策益加急　的今日！</p>
<p>潮汕人口約四百五十萬，每年米糧的消耗量約九百一十五萬七千餘担，而潮汕各縣生產的米每年僅七百四十萬祖，不敷之額約一百七十五萬担。兼之梅屬各縣所缺的米糧亦大部份由汕頭米商採購供給，統計潮梅兩屬需要外米接濟的數量每年約三百六十萬担。些三百六十萬担的米糧，在洋米未征稅以前，大部份由安南暹羅仰光等處供給，洋米征稅以後，則多由國米供給；湘米經粤漢路由廣州運來汕頭，蘇皖等省的米由上海出口，海運來汕。現在粤　路交通中斷，湘米巳絕對不能運汕銷售。經滬出口之蘇皖各省之米，最近一月來雖有五六萬包運來汕頭，爲潮汕食糧最大的來源，但是，敵人看得眼紅，現巳開始阻止蘇米運汕了。現在閩省當局復禁米運出省境，潮汕民食之國米供給已吿斷絕了。假如不及早設法挽救，潮汕嚴靈的米荒確有形成的可能。</p>
<p>防止潮汕米荒的唯一辦法便是打　洋米的來源了。洋米所以會不能有大量的進口，前面巳經說過，是因爲成本太高，成本高的原因，一是外匯的高漲，二是關稅的征收。要使洋米能够進口，當然要　法減低它的成本。外匯的高低是整個國家金融問題，不能使它跟局部的食糧問題而轉移，要滅低洋米的成本，我們所能做到的只有暫時需免洋米的進口稅、　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c52">軍火商的妻子　希迪拉瑪 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>二十三歲的希迪拉瑪、在好萊塢、在美國、在全世界的銀幕上、都是紅極了的第一流明星、可是她的過去、却正是一篇可歌可泣的小說、整整七年、她設法由惡劣的環境中解放出來、再靠着自己一番努力、終於把她從來的夢想化爲事實，這裏、我們由她主演第一張影片「慾焰」時說起、</p>
<p>那時她正是十六歲、一個還不十分明瞭世故的女孩、胡　胡塗的在演戲合同上簽下字、一點沒想到這件事對她的一生是如何重安、便對那些片中裸體和戀愛場面發生討厭、不知道這正是她日後成名的出發點、</p>
<p>而且這張片子引起了她父母的惡感、尤以父親——一個高貴的維也納銀行家——爲甚、希迪說：「律師勸他對這件事有所表示，他拒絕了、因爲這張影片在那時候還不甚出名、這樣一來、只有引起歡會人士的更大注意、』</p>
<p>他是錯了、這片子終於在歐洲大出其風頭、得了榮譽獎、此後在美國也引起了極大的重視、</p>
<p>片子攝成以後的希迪、　到維也納和父母同住、希望略略能減輕二老的煩惱、不久、他跨上了舞台、祖任在當地上演的「伊利莎白皇后」劇中的茜雪一角，又受了一次熱烈的歡迎、</p>
<p>就在這時候、常有人送花給她、每次、送來的大枇鮮花之間、總有一束附着「菲烈茲曼特爾」名字的花束、這個人請求和她會見一次、希迪雖然記得有這樣一個崇拜她的人、可是沒有給過他一次答覆、結果他們終於會面了、就在她家裏、由於她母親的介紹</p>
<p>他、是一個不達目的從不歇手的人、在歐洲、他的名宇常爲一種神秘的氛圍包裏着、再說得淸楚一點、是一個出名的軍火商、一個有力的幕後人、一個鐵石心腸的漢子、</p>
<p>第一次見面、他　直的問她、『你當然聽見過我的是不是」、</p>
<p>希迪微笑、「自然——不過並不是特別頂好的事、』</p>
<p>環境改變了她、使她對每個來訪的人、或那些對她陷入戀愛狀態中的人都有巧妙的應付方法，她向來對那些挾有野心俱來的人、極力不肯稍假辭色、否則將更多麻煩、</p>
<p>然而這次遇上菲烈茲、她感到一種不可抗拒的力量、他那可　的智力、各式各議的才幹、對體育的愛好和他特有的那種硬性的求愛方式、一切的一切、造成他那們一個活躍有生氣的男子、使她無可避免、不知不覺的也愛上了他、</p>
<p>婚禮是寧靜的、希迪完全沉醉在愛河裏、疏忽了今後的命運，。</p>
<p>婚後、菲烈茲把她像籠中小鳥似的家養起來、給她的別院、凡是她想要的、他一一聽從辦到、好了、這樣、一個女人還該不知足嗎、</p>
<p>可不是、他供給她一切的需要、然而他辦這些事正和經營軍火業一樣辦法、這就是他最大的錯誤了、他是他王國中的主宰、對僕役發命令、也對希迪發命令、對一切的人都發命令、他眞像是個皇帝、希迪就是皇后、皇后是沒有一點實權的、</p>
<p>希迪眞能長久停留在這種生活中嗎、她是有雄心的、早年就有一個要做个好萊塢影星的願望、可是現在結婚之後、在這種奢華而不自由的生活中、把日子一天一天的送過去、她成爲菲烈茲的禁衝、慢慢爲外面世界上的人所遺忘了、</p>
<p>現在的希迪可以肆無忌憚的談這些事、可是常她還是個禁宮中的皇后時、她連多一句話也不敢說、她的電話有人接綫竊聽、無論到什麽地方都有人暗中隨察、和同一男于連跳兩次舞更是絕對禁止的事、菲烈茲和她結婚、爲的就是要獨　她、同時也要她作如是想、一別的女子也許就會在這一樣的待遇下斷送了一生、可一並不是希迪、雖則她也曾被一迫在家裏、安安靜靜的做个囚犯、過了相當長久的一个時期、終於忍耐不住了、她想乞援於她的父母、不幸父親那時正息着很利害的心臟病、這事連吿訴他也不成、直到某一夜、父親逝去、她覺得這該是逃走的時期了、否則、遲早會被他自己所造成的「愁海」淹死的、</p>
<p>直到現在、希迪還不敢說出是誰助她逃出維也納來、而她自己也直到踏上倫敦的土地以後、才敢確信她是安全的了、由此可見、她是如何的畏懼她的丈夫和他那種特殊的監獄式的　情、</p>
<p>帶着一顆支離破碎的心、她在　晤士河畔遇見了、影業巨頭魯意斯梅耶夫婦、那點想做明星的希望之火重又燃燒起來，而且美國不是離開她丈夫更遠些嗎、於是當下決心、與梅耶夫婦同船赴美、在途中、由梅耶夫人的意思、改了名字、由希迪凱絲勒搖身一變而爲希迪拉瑪、後來的大影星的名字、</p>
<p>到了好萊塢、她開始學習演戲和英語、她那小孩脾氣還未改掉、情願跑到電影院去學英語、也不願和她私人敎師對坐着、這樣當然不會有什麽好成績、以致久久無戲可演、甚至後來米高梅公司裏的人也相信她不久會被送回歐洲去的、</p>
<p>大約在八個月後、一次宴會裏、却爾斯飽育發現了她、那時他巳被派爲『海角遊魂』的男主角、祇是女主角尙沒有定妥、希迪和他見面還不到一會兒、他就在該片製片人華爾脫華格面前推薦她、二</p>
<p>「那個正配作我們的女主角、你看對嗎』、</p>
<p>這位製片人看了她一眼、心想這話也許對，於是希迪被暫借去和別的人同試幾個鏡頭、試過十個人之後、希迪才正式的被借去充任「海角遊魂」的女主角、</p>
<p>此片一出、她的聲譽幾凌查爾斯飽育而上之、雖則她演戲很少、而全片也幾乎沒有她一個人的近寫、可是對於她最壞的批評也不過是說、一她並不在演戲、本片也未表明她是個好演員、可是我們不管這些』、終於她還是受着擁戴、</p>
<p>佛蘭克鮑賽琪是她新片I　Take　That　Woman的導演、他正極力的使這張片子有一個大收獲、而米高梅公司對她也特別重視起來了、我們希望她有更好的演出、她的前途是未可限量的、</p>
<p>她有一座靜雅的新住宅、配着最新式的傢具、希望最短期間內能把她母親接來同住、</p>
<p>因爲她和雷琪茄地納感情很好、當他傷　的時候、常到醫院探視、外面又有點捕風弄影了、然而希迪雖有一個熱情的個性、同時也有一個冷靜的判斷力、這事大約並不似一般所想的那樣、</p>

<p>（本報專訊）農曆新年期內舉行之港菲埠際足球賽、菲隊三戰三北、鍛羽南返、然其於比賽中雖無所獲、但因看客眾多、三場門票共收人一萬二千九百餘元、此種良好成績、誠非意料所及、故菲隊此行、雖然全敗、仍得滿意而歸、</p>
<p>港隊則定四月底赴菲報聘、咋（六）日總會月會時、曾經議决港隊於四月廿八日乘克利夭蘭總統輪船前往、五月十日自菲乘太平洋號輪船返港、至於人選事宜、則由管理組委員會負責辨理、</p>
<p>咋日管理組委員開會、對於選拔代表事宜、有所討論、並內定十五人、計爲譚均幹（南華華）、李天生、（南華南）、施漢（米杜息、菲士窩打（米杜息）、梁榮照（南華南），烈厘（海軍）奄巴臣（炮兵隊）、馮景祥（南華南）、李惠堂（　華會）、入告山奴（聖約瑟）、懇地（海軍）、侯容生（光華會）、衣史杜蘭治（香港會）、幕尼（米杜息）、黎兆榮（南華南）、</p>

<p>— 賴端甫</p>
<p>本月四日東方挾有破天荒擊敗南華南之餘威、渡海戰九龍會而不勝、我爲之惜、考其上半時不滕之原因、在於突用許竟成返當正前　、而用久未賽球之陳宇鈿作前鋒、若當時仍以有陣勢應戰、則勝利穩　也、乃因和局而冉失一分、　亞軍希望、已甚微弱、然昨日南華華竟勝海軍、此舉不特造福於南華南、亦有利於東方、本悉東方能否找尋今後之　　、而圖亞軍一席為已有耳、</p>
<p>華聯隊五日作督憲杯之戰、三次落後、四次平手、而後終得五對　勝利、人謂其勇毅可嘉、我謂其爾失當態、蓋西聯本臨時拉集成軍、殊非勁旅、華聯乃南華東方兩會之精英、是宜一氣呵成、大勝而特勝者也，乃一　賽來、多時落後、若從邏輯爲言、則力量如此、他日何以敵强旅、我見其事、不禁為華隊前途作杞　也、</p>
<p>顯然、華隊實非弱者、常日之反常、或事出偶然耳、　是吾爲愛見華隊必盡奪平　之六項錦　計、以爲後此之華聯前　綿、應有所改善、爲合作　、此後　線　論選用兩南華東方人物、或兩　方　南　　、均宜使同會者并肩、毋使甲會一人錯雜於乙會兩人之間而成各自爲戰之弊、五日之戰、兩東方員因欲維　、竟有由左直跑至右端、成又由右　直奔至左方以助同隊之人者、由是不獨陣容爲亂、且馴至二者奔走太多、竟有氣力不繼之狀、斯可爲今後遴員者作一教訓也、</p>
<p>李碩友元月一日被罰出塲而判取銷比賽資格至於十二月卅一日止、高路士溢華根於二月廿五日被罰出場亦取銷比賽資格至十二月卅一日止、足球總會似只知有十二月卅一日而不知有其他、果如此、我忽發奇想、以爲下屆比賽時、滿肚牢騷的球員、不妨於十二月尾時亂揮拳、豈不有坐幾日「波監」便了事的希望、一笑、</p>
<p>海軍快要出海大操演、此爲他日南華南與東方戰勝勁於之大機會、但、兩華隊莫作「坐過貴人一之想、仍要下苦工練習、待挫强敵爲宜、因海軍出操、終要大隊囘來、雖說好手如狄臣、韓尼維路、拖般、墾地等快要調防、但海軍健將眾多、來去不常、數健將雖去、不難到時冉來幾位更了得者、故我以爲華隊欲求上進、非寔行一自力更生」不可、</p>
<p>星期六日南華要與東方火併、同爭特別銀牌决賽權、同是華隊、我們中立派、自然那一隊得勝也同樣喜歡、所望者是到時兩隊注全神於賽時表演、切莫有本年一、月一日的重演、給人看了別有印象、</p>
<p>南華乙租本週末如能打政士萬隊，便可穩坐冠軍單、聞說南華到時要起用張滿榮當左冀、的是好新聞、但願他們此囘得勝、打開我們乙組多年未得聯賽冠軍之悶局、</p>

<p>（本報專訊）足球之戰、成敗至難逆料、如咋日下午南華華與海軍在加山舉行之甲組聯賽、凡熟悉本港足球現勢者、咸知海軍實力强勁，爲奪標呼聲最高之雄師、加以該隊處茲嚴重關頭而益自勉勵、志在必得錦標、氣慨不凡、而其各昌由來表演、亦常在良好狀態中、於是看客對咋日之戰局、多下肯定之預斷、認爲此兩點績分、海軍得之而無疑、其最高地位、當非刻已消失冠軍色相之南華華所可動彼分亳者也、記者之意、亦謂南華華凶多吉少、蓋鑑於該隊邇來戰績、無善足陳、又復人馬時　、職守靡　、尤足影響者、則李碩友停賽、揚水益匿跡、風兮鳳兮、至是有折冀之悲、劉　生林德譜又足傷尙未痊可、暫時不能上陣、雖南華旗下、濟濟多士、弗慮替補無人、但健將旣不齊、實力當削弱、識者以其每况愈下、以爲此後將無佳作復見矣、</p>
<p>昨日之戰、初見南華華登場人物、易以乙組球員五六人、陣容殊不整、看客覩狀、皆、其必敗、記者之意亦云然、以為所望於該隊帮忙乃兄（南華南）之舉、恐成夢想、蓋以人材加此、烏可抗强頑之海車、不特難以求勝、似亦難以求和、欲不敗者幾稀矣、詎知競爭結果、事實竟與吾人所預料者相反、彼自負勝利至有把握之海車、則人强馬壯、不可一世、無如演出多不佳、故至終局、被南華華攻下一城、以零比一失敗、其奪標地位、隨此一牧而動搖、或謂海軍數奇、至有冷門突出、而南華華挫此勁敵、雖於本身無所利、然因間接造福於乃兄、如他日南華南果得錦標、則弟弟之功、不可沒也、</p>
<p>去屆南華華榮膺冠軍，半由人力、半由倖致、然其間接得乃兄屢挫頑勁、造成其最高地位、是亦一因也、憔本屆自開賽以來、迄今五月、南華華在過程中、似無一是處、故間接所助於乃兄者、前未嘗見、迨昨日則一鳴驚人、軍威重振、竟將位高一切之海軍擊敗、此種偉大之功成、仍不失冠軍態度、月此勝之價值、非同等同、　助乃兄至多、等於服一定心丸也、</p>
<p>海軍之敗、原因有三、（一）初見南華華以半數乙組球自應戰、便存輕敵之心、以爲競爭之下、其取勝定不困難、因而各員演出甚　、（二）上半時海事屢攻不得逞、一無所　、至是輕敵之心、變爲着急、迨下　時急於圖勝，　急愈亂，遂遭挫敗、三）前衞三人、下半時常上前助　、置後防於不　、不料南華華即乘其防禦空虛之際、突然襲擊、其守將措手不及、卒簽城下盟、</p>
<p>南華華非勝干實力過人、亦非勝于技術超卓、唯一因素、乃全軍努力、奮鬥到底，見人則繼、見球　搶、故海軍雖　得勢、惟　　深入必受阻、有射又爲譚　幹所解救、門禁森嚴、莫　得入、總之、南華華之勝、厥因在于勇與勤、或謂南華華各員在此役之演出、英勇耐戰、有初陸甲組時之作風、此亦多調少壯派上陣所由致也</p>
<p>今南華華造福乃兄之願、經已得償、惟望南華南諸子、此後益加努力、再接再厲、以竟全功、方不致有負弟弟此番盛情也、</p>
<p>顧海軍之敗、球運不濟，亦是一因、試觀其上半時、圍攻南華華聲勢之大、可以爲證、同時南華華右翼葉潤波失機頻頻、不特不能與前線聯成一氣、反而累及後防多事、下半時廿八分鐘、楊根保猛射一球、哥打士士離出門外、葉氏飛奔而至、若從容一射、卽可獲勝、不料脚起球飛、越門而去、失必勝之良機、座上看容皆爲嘆惜不置、再三分鐘、根保盤球男淮、傳交潤波、潤波切中、德錦猛衝、迎球一頂、隊建奇勛、此葉氏間接之功、則足以補過也、</p>
<p>咋南華華表演最出色之人物，當推譚均幹與陳德輝、譚氏門前却敵、屢教險球、其餘諸子、皆能出盡九牛二虎之力、死纏敵將、其功甚偉、實應嘉許、海軍前鋒、能衝而不擅射、以致常失良機、同時右翼菲頻士、上半時足部被產傷、蹣跚不前、遂無雁行折冀、下半時十八分鐘、菲頻士雖與懇地互調、祇以奔走不能、無濟于事、完場前兩分鐘、拖舷會一度冷射、均幹及時單手托出門後、僅負角球、亦云幸矣、茲將雙方球負列后、</p>

<h3 id="c68">我們的批評呢？ <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>幾天前我遇見了一位做劇評的朋友，我知道他有這方面很努力，所以向他說：「你有希望休息個影評家。」他卽刻分辯：「不，不，為了生活。」真的，現在誰也免不了在麵包屑裏廝混，然而爲了這麼一混，好的東西簡直看不見了：批評界也如此。</p>
<p>報紙上或雜誌上，我很少發現好的批評文章，所見到的只是些千篇一律的「捧場」或「喝采」：這不是批評（Crftfcfsm）而是介紹（Revfewfng）我門當然不要介紹。這是　人的。我們的批評呢？</p>
<p>批評——文評，影評，書評，劇評，書評　——是藝術的一個部門。嚴格講來，聖柏甫（St．Beuye）以前沒有批評這樣東西，所以十九世紀起才有批評。它底歷史雖短，却　然露了頭角，成爲一種獨立的學問：因此，要想寫個批評，必須有相當的水準。我們都明自：好的批評與好的創作一樣具有積極的力量，可是怎樣才算一個好批評呢？</p>
<p>我這裏，依據繆萊（Murry）說法，把一個好的批評的水準寫在下面：</p>
<p>第一、表現出被批評東西的效果與特色</p>
<p>第二、浪溯這效果與特色，且述其必要的表現。</p>
<p>第三、建立這感人力的决定因索（作者身世可以一述）。</p>
<p>第四、作品形式技術的考察。</p>
<p>第五、某一特點的更仔細的考察。</p>
<p>最後，最重要的一點、卽批評家應該把自己提高，我們聽繆萊說吧：「批評家應該覺察自己就是一個藝術家，他應該注意放在他的藝術上的責任；他應該尊敬的工作的技術。他不應該賦價，也不應該輕信，他不應該不忠實，不論　美或責　，尤其在現代，他不應該在　美上不忠實。</p>
<p>繆萊未一點說得極透澈，爲了生活，大批評家變成賤價，顧不到自己的藝術或技術，做出不忠實的讀美與責——在我們就叫做「捧場」與「喝倒采」，這樣的人離批評家還遠哩。我們要再建批評。</p>
<p>我還覺得中國所以沒有好的批評，一部份是爲了沒有足够的篇幅給予批評。文藝副刊很少闢出批評一欄，他種副刊有着限制，雜誌現在談不上。這種環境，好的批評自然難能造成。批評本身旣是一種藝術，他要求一定容量的完整。</p>
<p>如果上面兩個條件達到——不賤價，不受篇輻的束縛——繆萊所定的五個水準怎樣達到？我敢提供一個方法：批評家是藝術家，那麼，像藝術家一樣，他要有修養與根基。批評家不容易做，佛勒里（Fleury）這樣向法朗士（A　France說：「先生，演詞，純文學，哲學，歷史，一切都在這裏，批評不算在內，它包括它們一切。對呀，批評家倫流做着演說家，哲學家，歷史家。」我希望，批評家不要爲了生活而忽略了他們的鍛鍊。</p>
<p>批評家，你們是有力量的，但不要貶價取巧。</p>
<h3 id="c69">胡銓的主戰論 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 杰</p>
<p>——讀史隨筆——</p>
<p>歷史往往是現實底極好的教訓。古人所錯誤的事，在歷史上照然明示着後人，使後人能够避免同樣錯誤的重演。這好像一隻綸船，在其一個礁石上觸沉，這礁石就應該有一個標示，警告後來的輪船。</p>
<p>在宋朝詩，遭受金人的侵略，徵欽二帝被據而去；黃河南北，相繼淪陷。於是宋高宗甫渡臨安，成立了偏安的小朝展，這時候，的確國難己達到極端。但當時內有李綱趙鼎等賢相，外有張浚，宗澤，岳飛，韓世忠等名將：而月兩河義兵豪傑，受宗澤節制而抗金的，有百萬之眾。這時候只須宋高宗下一個抗戰决心，不難收復失地—但可惜高宗昏庸懦弱，輕信了汪伯產，黃潛善，秦檜等　班主和派的妄言，竟接受辱國條件而與金人議和。於是賢相被逐，良將被　，兩河的百萬豪傑間之氣沮，也就四散解體了。</p>
<p>正在秦檜主持和議的時候，樞密院編修官胡銓力主抗戰，在他的上疏中，激昂沉痛，不但說明和戰的利弊，而且竟大膽主張把主和派暫首，以表示永不屈辱議和的決心，他目光中的主和派罪魁，是秦檜，孫近，王倫三個人，他上疏：說「願斷三人頭，竿之稿街，然後　留虜使，責以無禮，徐與問罪之師，則三軍之師不戰而氣自倍，不然，臣有赴東海而死耳，寧能處小朝廷求活耶？」疏上之後，秦檜還疑心他是有神經病的，否則怎能有這般大膽狂言呢？秦檜就把他貶官到廣州去，宜興人吳師古把胡銓的一篇「主戰論疏」刻在木上，金人出千金募之，可見敵人也祟拜宋朝的直凍忠臣。</p>
<p>後來宋孝宗接位，胡銓又第二次上疏，疏中又是排斥和議，請求出兵抗戰，他分析當時主和派的心理，極為詳細。他以為有三種主和的人：一種是「偷懦」全無復興民族的精神，只知貪生怕死，第二種是「茍安」只知道暫圖一時安逸，不為國家久長之計。第三種是「附會」，大臣說應該議和。就跟着附和，以博大臣歡心。國家者是被這三種人弄壞的可異胡銓二欠上疏，都沒有採用。宋高宗一誤於前，孝宗再誤於後，結果失地不能收復，宋朝也岌岌可危了！</p>
<p>前事不忘後事之師。歷史的教訓，每一個人應該牢記不忘。我們希望現在每一個人要做主戰的胡銓，把一切偷懦，茍安，附會的主和觀念澈底打消。誰敢公然主張議和，就該『斷其頭，竿之稿街』。</p>

<h3 id="c71">煉鎢 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 心君</p>
<p>世界上產鎢國要算中國第一，在湘贛粵桂等省礦產很多，全國產量佔世界產量的百分之三十七，實是我國的一大資源。鎢和錫很相似，所以不容易分辨出來，到了1781年，隋耳Scheele能辨出它是一種金屬。隔了兩年，有人將鎢分製出來，以後就用做硬的台金。但是從沒有單獨用過。到1905年鎢和糊調勻了，從模子裏擠射出來，才做成供給電燈泡裏用的最好的燈絲。不過鎢絲很脆，所以製造的時候很感覺困難，使用的時候也感覺不便，美國奇異公司柯立芝傳士費了多年的工夫。發明了使鎢有延性（柔靭）的方法。當初一般冶金專門家以爲還是不可能的，因爲平常使金屬有延性，是將金屬加熱到還韌點以上，再冷到導常溫度，就可以達到目的。但是用這樣方法應用到鎢上去，可說是毫無影響。末了，尋出了唯一的方法可以鍊，使韌。這方法是將着的金屬細粒搗碎，打成紋條。在冷的時候變軟，於是加熱，不使高到還靭點，隨卽很仔細的錘鍊。冷下後冉加熱錘鍊，每次的溫度比前一次要低一些。這樣再熱再冷，繼續錘鍊到尋常溫度爲止。要是對於旁的金屬用同樣的方法，不但不變韌，並且反而變脆了。</p>
<p>方法只有這一個，惟要完全照着一步一步的做，將金屬　粒拉出來，鱸就變韌了，若是稍爲粗心一些，就得完全失敗，弄得鎢到冷的時候，會一觸就粉碎了。</p>
<p>這樣經過多年的苦功研究，才有滿意的結果。所做成的鎢絲，眞有了不得的拉力：一英寸的千分之一的粗細，可受到每方吳寸六十萬磅的力。這種鎢絲柔　得可以繞成種種式樣，是不會斷的。成語說：百鍊鋼化爲繞指柔，現在真可說百鍊鎢化</p>
<p>慫鎢鑛裏提煉鎢的方法是比較簡單。就是從　石裏提出三養化鎢又名鴿酸，再用炭和三養化　起還原作用，得到不純粹的粉狀　。這種粉類用大的水力壓成條，不能用熱熔的，因爲鎢的熔點有3370度。比任何金屬都高，白金不過1755度，再從條做成絲，又費很多的手續，並且複羅的。</p>
<p>有了鎢絲之後，電燈泡的效率榆加了一倍以上，所發的光又比以前一切所用的燈，亮得白凈。留聲機片用的針頭用鎢鋼來製之後，其效率的增加比以前所用的針頭要五十多倍。其餘種種東西，像X射綫管　的靶子，汽車要的發火綫頭，卻是　鎢來改進的。</p>
<p>鎢的西文各有兩個是：Wolfram一是Tungsten。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Where is the Soviet Union Heading? – On the Report of the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is scheduled to open tomorrow, March 10th. At a time when the international situation is undergoing dramatic changes, fascist aggressors are intensifying their efforts to advance a world war, and the peace front is actively seeking to consolidate and expand its power, the attitude and internal affairs of the Soviet Union, regarded as a pillar of world peace, are naturally attracting worldwide attention. This 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party will not only hear important reports on all aspects of the Soviet Communist Party but will also make decisions based on these reports that will affect the entire Union and even the world. Therefore, this Congress is of particular interest to the people of all countries. At this Congress, Soviet People's Commissar Chairman Molotov will present a report on the "Third Five-Year Plan" for the development of the Soviet national economy, while Zhdanov will present an "Outline for Revising the Party Constitution." The reports of both Molotov and Zhdanov are particularly noteworthy because they not only explain the recent internal affairs of the Soviet Union but also foreshadow its future trends. Chinese compatriots, who have been heroically resisting aggression for twenty months and are continuing to advance on the path of resisting aggression and building the nation, should naturally examine the internal affairs and trends of the friendly Soviet Union calmly, removing emotions and prejudices. This will not only prevent them from being confused by the rumors and heresies that are rampant in the city but will also enable them to gain a correct understanding of the prospects for our country's resistance and nation-building and the international situation, and to strengthen their confidence in victory.</p>
<p>(1) Report on the Third Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Molotov's report on the "Third Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet National Economy" (1938-1942) was published in millions of Soviet newspapers on New Year's Day this year and sparked enthusiastic discussions among the working people of the country, gaining unanimous and sincere support. Molotov's report first pointed out the</p>
<p>Success of the Second Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>The successful completion of the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan means that it has completed its main historical task of building a socialist state. It has eliminated all exploiting classes. It has eradicated all factors that could lead to the exploitation of man by man and the division of people into exploiters and the exploited. It has completed the most difficult task of the socialist revolution—agricultural collectivization. The collective farm system is now deeply rooted, and it has established the first stage of socialism. The victory of socialism has been concretely embodied in the new Soviet Constitution. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, socialist industry accounted for 98.7% of the total production funds in the country. Socialist production has completely controlled the entire national economy, reaching 99.8% of the total industrial output value, 98.6% of the total agricultural output value, and 100% of the total trade volume. In 1937, workers and staff employed in the socialist economy accounted for 34.7% of the national population, collective farmers and handicraftsmen united in handicraft cooperatives accounted for 55.5%, and soldiers, students, dependents, and others accounted for 43%. Therefore, 94.4% of the national population is directly engaged in the socialist economy or closely related to it. In addition,</p>
<p>The Complete Technical Transformation of the National Economy</p>
<p>was the main decisive task of the Second Five-Year Plan, and it has now been largely successful. In 1937, more than 80% of the total industrial output was produced by factories newly built or completely renovated during the First and Second Five-Year Plans. About 90% of all agricultural tractors and combine harvesters were manufactured in the Soviet Union during the Second Five-Year Plan. The Second Industrial Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule in April 1937, in four years and three months. The railway transportation sector was completed in less than four years, and its performance exceeded the plan. In the agricultural sector, grain and cotton production also exceeded the plan. It is estimated that industrial production in 1937 increased by 120% compared to 1922, while the original plan was only 114%. Furthermore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, annual industrial production increased by an average of 17.1%, while the original plan was only 16.7%. In particular, since the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, all economic sectors have cultivated cadres capable of mastering new technologies. The greatest success is the emergence of important cadres among the Soviet intelligentsia and the bold promotion of new leading workers in all economic sectors, because regardless of whether these cadres are party members or non-party Bolsheviks, they are all necessary for all aspects of socialist construction. (This spirit is naturally even more worthy of encouragement in China today.) In particular, the Stakhanov movement vividly reflects the success of Soviet construction in mastering new technologies. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, labor productivity in large-scale industry increased by 82%, while the original plan was only 63%.</p>
<p>Improvement of Material and Cultural Standards</p>
<p>The task stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan, "to raise the material and cultural standards of the working class and to increase consumption by more than two times," has also been completed. The number of workers and staff in all sectors of the national economy increased by 17.6%. The average annual wage of workers and staff in 1937 increased by 113.5% compared to 1932. The state allocated funds for workers', peasants', cultural, and material services (education, health, etc.) increased from 44 billion to 140 billion rubles. Furthermore, the total income of collective farmers increased by 2.7 times in the four years from 1933 to 1937. The production of necessities in 1937 increased more than two times compared to 1932, and the total amount of state and cooperative trade increased more than five times. During the same period, a cultural revolution actually took place in the country. The number of primary and secondary school students increased from 21.3 million to 29.4 million, and the number of university students increased to 550,000. The progress of the material and cultural development of the peoples of the Soviet East was particularly rapid.</p>
<p>A New Stage for the Soviet Union</p>
<p>With the end of the Second Five-Year Plan and the beginning of the Third Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union has entered a new stage, completing the construction of a classless socialist society and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. Molotov gave clear instructions regarding the tasks of this new stage:</p>
<p>In this stage, the communist education of the working people is of decisive importance. It must overcome the remnants of capitalism in the hearts of the people (communist builders). The Soviet Union has been transformed into an economically independent country, capable of providing its national economy and national defense with all the necessary technical equipment. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of industrial growth rate. The shortcomings of the Soviet Union's total industrial output compared to the most advanced capitalist countries in terms of technology and economy must be completely eliminated so that communism can achieve final victory in the historical competition with capitalism. We are now able to, and must, take on the responsibility of completing the main economic tasks of the Soviet Union ourselves, catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in Europe and the United States in the economic field, and solving this problem in the near future. At the same time, in the new plan, we must promote the increase of national income and trade volume, so that the consumption of the masses can be increased by one and a half to two times. In further coordination with such major tasks, we must improve the cultural level of all working people in cities and rural areas, so that the cultural and technical level of the working class—the leading force at the forefront of socialism—advances to the level of engineers and technicians.</p>
<p>Molotov's report pointed out that the industrial and national economy have developed greatly during the second five-year plan period. It is now required to further develop unhindered in accordance with a fixed plan, especially under the conditions of imperialism intensifying its aggression and surrounding the Soviet Union. We must create large-scale national reserves, first of all regarding fuel, electricity, a part of international industry, and the development of the transportation industry.</p>
<p>Contents of the Third Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>How will the Soviet Union implement the new tasks of the current new stage in Molotov's report? The third five-year plan, in coordination with the above tasks, puts forward the following provisions:</p>
<p>Industrial Aspect</p>
<p>It stipulates that in 1942 (the last year of the third five-year plan), the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union should be 1.8 trillion rubles, an increase of 88% compared to 955 billion in 1937. Among them, the production of production tools will increase by 103%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 69%. This year, Soviet industry should produce 1.4 million tons of automobiles, 750 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 230 million tons of coal, 54 million tons of oil, 22 million tons of pig iron, 27.7 million tons of steel, 21 million tons of rolled steel, and a total value of 134 billion rubles of chemical products. The output of the machine manufacturing industry should increase by 2.25 times. Increase coal production, so that it is not only sufficient for domestic needs, but also can establish national reserves; establish a new oil base "Second Baku" in the Volga River and Ural Mountains, and expand the gasification of various fuels, especially underground gasification of coal, so that it becomes an independent industry; According to the gasification method of hard fuel, create an artificial liquid fuel industry, first implement it in the east, and use artificial methods to turn gas into liquid fuel. Increase the total power generation of each power plant to 2.1 times, and transform the chemical industry into one of the main industrial sectors to meet the needs of the national economy and national defense. In addition, the third five-year plan should also be a chemical five-year plan. The production of the chemical industry should increase by 2.3 times. The iron and steel industry should also continue to increase production, so that the same plan also becomes a special five-year plan. The production of general consumer goods should increase by 1.7 times, industrial labor productivity should increase by 65%, and production costs should be reduced by 11%.</p>
<p>Agricultural Aspect</p>
<p>The total agricultural output value is stipulated to increase from 198 billion in 1937 to 302 billion rubles in 1942, an increase of 53%; At the same time. The average annual grain harvest is stipulated to increase from 550 million bushels during the second five-year plan period to 700 million bushels, an increase of 27%; By 1942, the harvest of industrial crops is stipulated to increase to 300 million quintals of sugar beets, 32.9 million quintals of cotton, and 8.5 million quintals of flax. Among livestock, horses will increase by 35%, cattle by 40%, pigs by 100%, sheep and goats by 10%. The mechanization of agricultural methods should also be thoroughly completed.</p>
<p>Transportation Aspect</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, railway freight transport is stipulated to increase from 355 billion ton-kilometers in 1937 to 510 billion ton-kilometers in 1942; River freight transport will increase from 33 billion ton-kilometers to 58 billion ton-kilometers. The railway will add 7,370 locomotives and 190,000 vehicles. 11,000 kilometers of new railways will be built, 8,000 kilometers of double-track railways will be laid, and 1,840 kilometers of railways will be electrified. The navigable waterways of inland rivers will be expanded from 101,000 kilometers to 115,000 kilometers. By the end of this plan, the Arctic Ocean route will become a regular navigable waterway, maintaining normal traffic with the Far East. Automobile transport will increase by 4.6 times, and 210,000 kilometers of highways will be built and renovated.</p>
<p>Other Aspects</p>
<p>In terms of talent, Molotov's report suggested training 104,000 various specialized technicians and 600,000 specialized talents who have received higher education.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total value of capital construction within the third five-year plan is stipulated to be 1.8 trillion rubles (the second five-year plan was 1.15 trillion rubles), of which 1.033 trillion is for industry, 358 billion is for transportation, and 106 billion is for agriculture. The total value of new and renovated factories opened is 17.9 billion rubles. The total power generation of each power plant is increased, so that it is increased from 80 billion kilowatts to 172 billion kilowatts. Increase coal production by 1.7 times, steel plant production to 24 million tons, pig iron industry to 2.4 times, aluminum to 3.8 times, automobile industry to 2.4 times, and cotton industry to 1.5 times.</p>
<p>Especially Accelerate Construction in the Far East</p>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy in the Soviet Union's third five-year plan is the provision to especially accelerate construction in the Far East. Molotov's article stipulates: The capital construction and factory construction in the eastern and far eastern regions should be accelerated, and efforts should be made to develop the metallurgical industry in these regions, create a large textile industry in the east, and use cotton from Central Asia. Ensure the further economic and cultural development of national republics and provinces.</p>
<p>The large factories to be built during the third five-year plan are several heavy machine tool manufacturing plants, five turbine manufacturing plants, several small automobile manufacturing plants, and multiple new automobile assembly and freight automobile plants in Siberia and the Far East. Several spinning machine and weaving machine manufacturing plants. Start creating the world's largest construction project, two hydroelectric power plants in Kuibyshev, with a total of 3.4 million kilowatts. Start building the Kaluga Hydroelectric Power Plant, creating the Uglich, Rybinsk, Chirchik, Kanakir, Svir (two), Niva (two), Sudomi, and other hydroelectric power plants. Start building one hydroelectric power plant and 91 local thermal power plants. Develop several new mines with a total annual output of 150 million tons. Open several new oil refineries with a total capacity of 15 million tons and several refineries with a total capacity of 4.5 million tons. Complete the construction projects of the Magnitogorsk Steel Plant, Novaya Tagil, Petrovsk-Zabaikalsky, Zaporozhye Plant, and Azov Steel Plate Plant in the Amur River; Start building several new steel plants in the South Ural and East Siberia. Build an electric pole steel pipe plant in the Urals and a steel pipe plant in the central region. Build 20 new iron-smelting blast furnaces. In the non-ferrous industry, complete the construction of the Balesh Copper Plant and the Central Ural and Buryatia United Plant. Start building the Dzhezkazgan and Almalyk Copper Smelting Plants, and the Altai Lead and Zinc Smelting Plant. Open the Ural Lead Plant, the Kandalaksha and Rybinsk Lead Plant, and the South Ural and Northern Nickel Plant. Start building several new lead, zinc, tin, tungsten, and other plants. In the chemical industry, start building several new soda and sulfuric acid plants, 14 artificial rubber plants, 14 tire plants, 7 canvas plants, and 46 natural rubber plants, and two artificial liquid fuel plants.</p>
<p>Renovate Both Old and New Cities</p>
<p>Moscow and Leningrad will continue to be developed and renovated according to the original plan. Complete the third section of the Moscow Subway and largely complete the Palace of Soviets.</p>
<p>In the agricultural sector, add 1,500 machine tractor stations and build several new granaries with a total capacity of more than 10 million tons.</p>
<p>To improve the cultural standards of working people in urban and rural areas, the consumption of the working people should be increased by more than 1.5 times. The number of workers and staff should increase by 17% compared to 1937, their average wages should increase by 35%, and total wages should increase by 62%. The state should allocate funds for cultural and material service undertakings, including social insurance, education, health, and allowances for children, which should be increased from 30.8 billion in 1937 to 53 billion rubles. The income of collective farmers should also be greatly increased.</p>
<p>In terms of education, universal secondary education should be implemented in cities, and the implementation of universal seven-year education (primary education) should be completed in rural areas. The number of primary and secondary school students in cities should increase to 12.7 million, in rural areas to 27.7 million, and the number of university students should increase to 650,000.</p>
<p>The state health expenditure should increase from 10.3 billion in 1937 to 16.5 billion rubles in 1942. The value of state and cooperative trade should increase from 126 billion in 1937 to 206 billion rubles in 1942.</p>
<p>The gross national income should increase by 1.8 times in five years.</p>
<p>Advancing Towards Victory</p>
<p>From Molotov's report, we can see: First, after the second five-year plan, the Soviet Union has eliminated all exploiting classes. It has eradicated all factors that could lead to the exploitation of man by man and the division of society into exploiters, and it has basically established the first stage of communist socialism in the country. Second, the third five-year plan is based on the new stage of Soviet development and aims to complete the construction of a classless socialist society, gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. Third, in order to complete the third five-year plan, the communist education of the working people has gained decisive importance. The current conditions have made the position of the Soviet intelligentsia increasingly important. They know how to work and struggle in the Bolshevik style, thereby improving the cultural level and communist consciousness of the working people. Fourth, Molotov also specifically pointed out in his report that in order to complete the tasks and opinions stipulated in the third five-year plan, it is necessary to launch socialist competition and the Stakhanov movement, resolutely maintain labor discipline, and completely eliminate the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of the Trotskyist and Bukharinist fascists and foreign capitalist spies, such as strengthening the vigilance of the Bolsheviks. Finally, we can see from this report that after the political and economic position of the Soviet socialist society has been consolidated, cadres who can grasp production technology have decisive importance. This Soviet cultural force will lead the working masses to engage in a great struggle to strive for the complete victory of communism.</p>
<p>(2) Report on the Amendment to the Party Constitution – Modifying the Conditions for Recruiting Party Members</p>
<p>Zhdanov's report on the Outline for Revising the Party Constitution first suggested modifying the conditions for recruiting party members. Because the class boundaries among the Soviet working people have been largely eliminated since the completion of the second five-year plan, the economic and political contradictions between workers, peasants, and intellectuals have also been largely eliminated and are tending to disappear. The conditions for the Communist Party to recruit new party members should also be appropriately modified. Currently, the procedures for recruiting party members are divided into four classes according to the social status of the applicant. Chapter 1 of the All-Union Communist Party Constitution (unanimously adopted by the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party) stipulates:</p>
<p>1. All those who recognize the Party Program, work in a Party organization, obey Party resolutions, and pay Party dues shall be considered Party members.</p>
<p>2. (Omitted)</p>
<p>3. Acceptance of party members can only be carried out according to individual procedures. New party members are accepted from candidate party members who have passed the prescribed probationary period, received political common sense education, and understood the Party Program and Party Constitution. Workers, collective farmers, Red Army soldiers, students, and staff who have performed well in the sympathy group, in the Soviets, trade unions, youth leagues, cooperatives, and congresses, and who have received criticism from the organization where they previously or currently work, can be accepted as party members.</p>
<p>The procedures for candidate party members to become party members are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Four categories are stipulated: 1. Industrial workers with five years of production experience; 2. Industrial workers with less than five years of production experience, agricultural workers, Red Army soldiers from workers and collective farmers, engineering and technical personnel who work directly in workshops or production sections; 3. Collective farmers, members of handicraft combinations, primary school teachers; 4. Other staff.</p>
<p>(2) To join the party, the first category of people must have three party members with five years of party membership to introduce them; the second category of people must have five party members with five years of party membership to introduce them; the third category of people must have five party members with five years of party membership and an introduction from the political department of the agricultural machinery station or a representative of the district committee; the fourth category of people must have five party members with ten years of party membership to introduce them.</p>
<p>(3) Omitted below</p>
<p>This method is not in line with the class structure of Soviet society after the victory of socialism. Therefore, Zhdanov's report proposed to abolish the current classification of recruiting party members. From now on, when new party members join, whether they are workers, peasants, or intellectuals, the procedures should be the same.</p>
<p>Increase the Provisions of Party Members' Rights</p>
<p>In the past, the rights of party members were considered self-evident and were not listed in the Party Constitution. This report proposed adding a new clause to the Party Constitution, stipulating that party members have the right to criticize any party staff at the party meeting, to elect and be elected into the party organs, to require attendance at any time when the activities or behavior of Japanese people are discussed and decided, to raise any questions, or to declare to any party organization, including the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party.</p>
<p>Regarding the Abolition of Party Purification Methods</p>
<p>The Soviet Party purification method was adopted when the New Economic Policy was first implemented. Now that the situation has evolved, this method no longer has any reason to continue to exist. At the same time, the experience in implementation has also proved that this method cannot individually examine each party member. As a result, it is not effective for opposition elements who are good at disguising themselves, but it is easy to expel loyal and conscientious party members on the grounds of "passivity." Therefore, Zhdanov's report proposed to abolish the method of periodic mass purification of the party, and suggested that when deciding on the issue of expulsion from the party, a very cautious and concerned attitude should be adopted, the reasons for the accusations against party members should be carefully examined, and the rights of party members should be protected so that they are not harmed by any arbitrary actions. Expulsion from the party should be used as the party's highest punishment and only used when it is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Truly Realize Democracy Within the Party</p>
<p>Zhdanov's report also proposed to list the various methods that the Soviet Communist Party has already implemented to effectively realize the effectiveness of democracy within the party as concrete clauses in the Party Constitution, such as secret voting in party elections, prohibiting nominations, party members can criticize and attack candidates without restriction, and periodically convene meetings of active party workers in urban areas. Because the primary organizational task of the party is the correct selection of cadres and the examination of the implementation status of resolutions, Zhdanov's report suggested setting up a Cadre Department under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and setting up cadres under the provincial and regional party committees, the central committees of the party of the national republics, and the city and district committees.</p>
<p>Add a Propaganda Department</p>
<p>In order to improve the party's propaganda work to a proper level, the report suggested setting up a Propaganda Department under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and setting up propaganda departments under the provincial and regional party committees, the central committees of the party of the national republics, and the city and district committees.</p>
<p>Because the pace of the party's and the country's life is accelerating, and in order to solve urgent problems in the party's policy in a timely manner, the report proposed to convene a plenary meeting of representatives of the party's local branches throughout the country at least once a year, and to empower the meeting with the right to recall members of the Central Committee who cannot effectively perform their responsibilities and to elect other members to replace them, but the number cannot exceed one-fifth of the number of Central Committee members elected by the Party Congress. The decisions of the above-mentioned meeting, except for the replacement of Central Committee members, must be approved by the Central Committee.</p>
<p>Party Department Supervises Production Institutions</p>
<p>Because the basic organizations of the party have become increasingly strong and their relationship with practical administrative and cultural work has become increasingly close, Zhdanov's report also suggested: In order to strengthen the status of each basic organization in each production institution, including state-owned and collective farms, and to increase its responsibility for each institution, it is necessary to empower the organization with the right to supervise the work of the administrative organization of each institution. The party organizations in each People's Committee cannot implement supervision due to the special working conditions of the Soviet organs. They must notify the Central Committee of the Party and the leading personnel of each People's Committee of the deficiencies in the work of each People's Committee and each of its staff members.</p>
<p>Promote New Working Cadres</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to create conditions for promoting new working cadres to take on leadership work within the party, the report suggested stipulating that the minimum party experience for secretaries of provincial and regional committees and central committees of national republics should be more than five years (previously it was twelve years). The minimum party experience for secretaries of each lower-level party branch should also be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>Conclusion: When the fascist aggressors are intensifying their attacks on democratic peace-loving countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and are implementing their war to redivide the world, in order to undermine the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, undermine the growing prestige of the Soviet Union among democratic peace-loving countries and all righteous people in the world, and undermine the close ties between democratic peace-loving countries and the Soviet Union, they have spared no expense in spending huge sums of money and manpower to carry out a slander campaign against the Soviet Union's foreign policy, especially its internal situation. However, from Molotov's report on the Third Five-Year Plan, we can see the unprecedented progress and victory of the Soviet Union and the entire people of the Union in their economy, culture, and daily life. This progress and victory is still developing at a rapid pace. (Here we should know that the economic situation of the capitalist countries and their people, especially the countries under the control of fascist aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, and their people, and their material and cultural living conditions, on the contrary, are unprecedentedly regressing and impoverished—) At the same time. From the "Outline for Revising the Party Constitution" reported by Zhdanov at this Congress, we can see the improvement of the political status of the Soviet people and the leap forward progress of the entire Soviet Union. This progress itself is an invincible force. It silently shattered the rumors of the fascist foreign capitalists about the Soviet Union. It will also silently increase its prestige among the working masses and righteous progressives in the world, and fulfill its task as the most loyal and strongest guardian of world peace and culture.</p>
<h3 id="e2">×Devaluation of Legal Tender, Oppression of Chinese and Foreign Banks ×Failure to Obtain Foreign Exchange Led to Significant Impact from Counterfeit Currency Circulation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondence) Since the implementation of our country's legal tender policy, due to sufficient reserves, it has gained the faith of both Chinese and foreigners. The Japanese, after failing to obtain foreign exchange through a "linked banknote" scheme, have forcibly devalued the legal tender, and both Chinese and foreign banks have been subjected to oppression. Representatives from banking circles in North China have arrived in Shanghai to report on the situation, details of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Counterfeit Currency Everywhere</p>
<p>Since the fall of Tianjin, the puppet organization in Peiping established the "China United Reserve Bank" and issued banknotes without any collateral, forcing their circulation in the market. As of January 10th of this year, the total amount in circulation reached a staggering 185 million yuan. In addition, there were unsecured banknotes issued by the "Central Bank of Manchuria" and the "Ji-dong Bank," with approximately 16 million yuan circulating in Peiping and Tianjin. Furthermore, the Hebei Provincial Bank has expanded its issuance to 58 million yuan. Recently, the "United Reserve Bank" has also issued three types of small-denomination, non-convertible paper money in denominations of five fen, one fen, and half a fen. The scope of circulation is extremely broad, and the quantity issued is unlimited.</p>
<p>Forced Devaluation</p>
<p>The aim of the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in issuing banknotes was to absorb our legal tender and seize foreign exchange. However, due to the Chinese government's control of foreign exchange and the people's increasing faith in the legal tender, the counterfeit currency was only accepted and paid out. As a result, the puppet organization's plan to obtain foreign exchange failed, and the circulation of counterfeit currency was greatly affected. Consequently, orders were issued, first forcibly halting the circulation of our legal tender in Peiping, Tianjin, and other occupied areas. Subsequently, the China and Communications Banks in Tianjin were limited to using legal tender banknotes at 90% of their face value. From January 20th of this year, the rate was further reduced to 60%, and from March 10th, the circulation of legal tender was completely stopped in the market.</p>
<p>Oppressing the Market</p>
<p>The puppet interim government's finance department, in conjunction with the Peiping Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association, stipulated that from February 20th, all deposit contracts using the term "legal tender" must be changed to the term "national currency" (meaning the puppet United Reserve Bank's banknotes). Failure to do so would result in a discount of 60% based on the second devaluation. Foreign banks would continue to pay in legal tender for drafts, but checks would be divided into legal tender and "puppet currency." During the second devaluation period, foreign bank notes could only be collected at a 60% discount. After March 10th, they could no longer be collected.</p>
<p>Real Currency Situation</p>
<p>In fact, in the guerrilla areas of North China and the concession and embassy areas of Tianjin and Peiping, legal tender trades at a premium of approximately 2%, and no one has ever been heard of using our legal tender at a 90% or 60% discount. This shows that the price of our legal tender remains stable and its credit is increasingly strong. On the contrary, although "puppet currency" is widely accepted in Peiping and Tianjin, its actual price is lower than that of legal tender.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Various Circles in Chongqing Host Soiree for Families of Soldiers <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing Correspondence] The families of soldiers fighting at the front are the most glorious families in China's war of resistance. Their glory is like that of a family in the imperial examination era whose children passed the highest level exam... The bustling scene in Chongqing is the radiation and pervasion of the glory of these 'Glorious Families.'</p>
<p>Motorcades of cars offering support are speeding along, and dragon lanterns and musical ensembles are performing in the bustling areas. What deserves special attention is the grand 'Soiree in Honor of Families of Soldiers,' held at Daliangzi. By a little after 3 p.m., the venue was already packed, with every inch of the second and third floors also filled with people. In total, there were perhaps two or three thousand people, men and women, young and old, each with strong, healthy faces and smiles of reassurance and victory, symbolizing the health and happiness of the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>At this time, the reporter interviewed sixty-year-old Jiang Yuncheng and fifty-year-old Lei Laotai. Strangely, they both unanimously told me that their children's conscription was out of their own free will. Jiang Pinggui is only eighteen years old and has been in the army for more than a year. He is a patriotic and filial child. His letter to his father read: "The lamb kneels for milk, the bird feeds its mother. How can a human being be inferior to birds and beasts? Therefore, I have saved twenty yuan from my pay to provide for you." Jiang told me that Pinggui used to support the family by ferrying boats, but later business declined due to the opening of steamships, so he joined the army to kill [the enemy], both to save the country and to help support the family. When Lei Laotai's son left home to enlist, he did not obtain his mother's permission. The old mother suddenly realized that her son was missing and became anxious, but later she knew that he must have joined the army because he had told her, "If we don't go to kill the Japanese [enemy], China will be destroyed."</p>
<p>Great Chinese nation! Who says it is still a sleeping lion?</p>
<p>Around 3:30, officials such as Ye Gongchuo, Shao Lizi, Lü Chao, Ms. Shi Liang representing Madame Chiang, and community leaders such as Hu Wenlan and Wen Shaohe led the opening ceremony on the platform. Minister Chen Cheng of the Political Department presided over the ceremony and delivered a message of condolence. Because of continuous meetings, his throat was already hoarse, but he still raised his voice and said: The Japanese [enemy] imperialists have been plotting for decades to destroy China and enslave our people. Our supreme leader knows the Japanese's vicious plot, so he resolutely launched the war of resistance. This war of resistance should be the responsibility of our entire nation. If we want to resist, we must have an excellent army. An excellent army is composed of our excellent people. The war has been going on for more than a year... the [enemy] has been unable to cope with our attacks. But we are becoming stronger and stronger. We are absolutely confident of achieving final victory. This is the achievement and glory of your children and husbands—dear families of soldiers. I want to tell you that your children and husbands at the front have a very good life and are very secure. I came from the front, and I feel that the front is better than the rear. I saw that the brothers at the front were very strong and healthy. Moreover, the government is very concerned about your children and husbands, so it has decided to give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and has established a soldiers' comfort association to formulate comfort measures. Each family of a soldier receives two dan of grain, which is equivalent to fifteen yuan, and this will be issued every three months. In Chongqing, this will be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau. If it is found that a Baojia chief is abusing or cheating, you can report it to the government for investigation. Finally, one point is that our current war of resistance is directly related to defending our homeland. We are now going to kill the Japanese, so that they cannot come to Sichuan. Otherwise, if everyone does not take action, the Japanese can kill us in Sichuan and use cruel bestial behavior, like the people of the Lower Yangtze have suffered, to kill our parents, children, and [enemy] our sisters. In the past, the common people regarded being a soldier as a hardship. Now, it is no longer the same. In some places, the people are vying to volunteer to be soldiers. As long as everyone unites to eliminate the Japanese [enemy], our nation will have a way out. After Minister Chen finished speaking, Hu Wenlan and Wen Shaohe also gave speeches, generally saying that "the families of soldiers who have gone to war are the most glorious figures, so we should respect the soldiers and also respect the families of soldiers. In the future, we must further promote this significance, so that more people will join the army, and victory can be achieved more quickly." Ms. Shi Liang, representing Madame Chiang, also encouraged the women to encourage their husbands, sons, brothers, and younger brothers to kill [the enemy]. Madame Chiang will definitely use her full spirit to find ways to comfort our soldiers at the front, so that their families have work to do and their children have books to read. Chongqing is now preparing to establish a factory for the families of soldiers. In the future, when it is established, we hope that everyone will actively participate. Finally, the families of soldiers, Zhang Minglou, Luo Renzhai, and others delivered responses, thanking the authorities for their concern and happily comforting the soldiers. They unanimously believe that this is the duty of the people. "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual. The victory at the front is the happiness of the rear. Moreover, it is truly an honor to have our children at the front killing [the enemy]," and so on.</p>
<p>The wonderful and cheerful entertainment program began, and two or three thousand hearts in the venue were transformed into emotions of glory and joy. (3.1)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shashi, 7th] The war in Central Hubei is extremely fierce. Our forces are actively counter-attacking on all fronts, achieving many victories. On the Hankou-Yichang Railway, our troops are approaching Wamiaoji. Five to six hundred [enemy] soldiers and more than twenty tanks at Sanyangdian were attacked by our forces multiple times, and [enemy] casualties were heavy. The [enemy] in Xiantao Town were annihilated by our forces, and Xiantao Town has been recaptured.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 8th] A foreigner who recently arrived here from Yichang told an Associated Press reporter that the Japanese army had occupied Anlu, and the situation in Yichang was somewhat tense. However, whether the Japanese army's next move would be to cross the Xiang River to the south or to attack Xi'an is still unknown. Military experts told the Associated Press reporter that the Chinese army is now preparing to defend against the Japanese army's advance along the Pinghan and Longhai railway lines in Henan Province. After occupying Anlu, the Japanese army may target Xiangyang and then attack Laohukou from Xiangyang.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 8th] A Japanese military spokesman said that there are currently about seventy divisions, totaling about 300,000 Chinese troops, fighting the Japanese army in the area south of the Longhai Railway and west of the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese army in Anlu is advancing towards Suixian. It is reported that the Chinese army has moved northwest. Also, about seven divisions of Chinese troops between Haizhou and Xuzhou are intercepting the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu. Yesterday, Sunday, Japanese air force units bombed Chinese cities and Ningxia in the northwest. At that time, about thirty Japanese aircraft attacked Ningxia, and about twenty aircraft entered the airspace and dropped bombs on the area.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Due to repeated internal disputes within the Japanese army in China and frequent anti-war incidents, the military headquarters recently dispatched a large number of personnel to various regions to supervise. Japanese army supervisors Koki and Zhuang Tian in South China arrived here the day before yesterday. It is said that since the [enemy] army landed in the [enemy] region, until the end of December last year, there were a total of 27 internal disputes and anti-war incidents within the Japanese army in South China, including 15 anti-war incidents. The future of the war is particularly worrying.</p>
<p>Internal Disputes Abound, Nakano Heavily Attacked</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] According to Japanese sources, Nakano may be dismissed from his position as a member of parliament for being absent from parliamentary meetings. The real reason is that Nakano gave a speech in Shanghai the day before yesterday attacking the government. Nakano and another member of parliament, Kimura, had requested a week's leave from parliament to accompany German and Italian reporters to China to inspect the war. Now they want to extend their leave, and it is said that the Seiyukai party has expressed opposition. If they are not allowed to extend their leave, they must return to the country within a week to attend the parliament. If they are overdue, they will be dismissed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 8th] Local Japanese officials were furious about Nakano's speech yesterday and asked [the party] to deny that it had approved Nakano's speech draft. They said that he is the chairman of the Toho Society, but he does not have the power to influence the government. Japanese military officials said that Nakano is overly sensitive. However, it is understood that [they] have refused Nakano to accompany German and Italian reporters to inspect the [front] line.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 8th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui told officials of the United States today that "a roundtable conference convened by the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss ending the Sino-Japanese War is the only feasible way to resolve the war and establish peace. China will agree to participate in this conference, provided that the conference must maintain China's territorial and administrative integrity, the Open Door Policy, and the principle of equal opportunity. The interests of Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in the Far East are very great, the same as Japan. Can send notes to Japan (not necessarily joint notes), urging Japan to participate in this conference to discuss peace, but at present Japan obviously has no intention of accepting this form of mediation, because Japan's 'New Order in East Asia' policy is based on seizing hegemony over the entire Pacific region, which was clearly expressed in the Konoe Declaration in December last year. However, as the war lengthens, Japan's national strength is gradually turning [against it], and at that time, it will accept mediation. After the mediation of the third country tends to fail, active steps should be taken to aid [China], and passive steps such as boycotting Japanese goods should be taken. These steps can be effective. Recently, Great Britain and the United States have provided loans to China, and the attitudes of Great Britain, the United States, and France towards Japan have gradually strengthened. China's diplomacy has progressed more than a few months ago."</p>
<h3 id="e11">Commemorating March 8th <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Soong Mei-ling</p>
<p>——Original Speech at the Chongqing Commemoration Meeting——</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The original text of Madam Chiang Soong Mei-ling's speech at the "March 8th" Commemoration Meeting is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, today we are holding a meeting to commemorate "March 8th." This "March 8th" was designated as International Women's Day at a meeting held in Copenhagen in 1909. It has been exactly 30 years to this day, so today is the 30th anniversary of "March 8th." Our women of the Republic of China, in today's [enemy's] invasion and the suffering of the country, in today's war of resistance and national construction, are holding this important commemoration. Each of our hearts must have a special feeling. The meaning of "March 8th," as everyone knows, is to seek women's liberation, but so-called "women's liberation" is not just liberation for its own sake. It requires the efforts of our women compatriots to enhance the status of our nation, to make national life influenced by women, thereby raising its standards in both spiritual and material aspects, so that the majority and even all of our compatriots can obtain independent, free, and equal happiness. We must recognize that women's liberation cannot be seen as merely a right, but should be regarded as a responsibility. Why do we demand women's liberation? It is to take on our women's responsibilities. In other words, if we want to truly seek women's liberation, we must first be able to take on responsibilities. Our leader, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, said a few very important words in a speech in 1924: "The reason why the revolution cannot succeed is that individuals fight for freedom and forget the freedom of the country. We must know that without the freedom of the country, individuals cannot be free." This is a very true principle. We need liberation, and we must also know that if the country is not liberated, the women of our country will not be truly liberated. Our country is being bullied and invaded by [enemy] people today, and the entire nation is under the military oppression of violence. All of our compatriots are suffering and in pain. If we do not first rescue this critical country, our 450 million men and women will all become slaves of a lost country. Where can we talk about women's liberation, and who can we ask for women's liberation?</p>
<p>I often say that women's liberation depends on the efforts of women themselves. If our women's knowledge and ability are constantly improving, and our women are making real contributions to the country, the nation, and the world, then women's status will naturally rise. Now some people may think that women's participation in politics is the first step in seeking women's liberation. This may be true. Modern countries cannot deny that women should have the right to participate in politics, but the true meaning of women's liberation is not just to seek for a small number of women to gain political and economic status, but to liberate the suffering of the majority of women and improve the lives of the majority of women compatriots, starting with education and organization to enhance women's abilities and improve women's status. Moreover, to be honest, it is not enough to only talk about women's liberation. We must use our women's strength to achieve the liberation of all our compatriots, and that is how we fulfill our responsibilities.</p>
<p>Today, many representatives of women's organizations are present, including women from intellectual circles, women from professional circles, and women from the working class. Among the tens of millions of female compatriots, we are considered to be more capable and influential. Although we cannot be said to be the first to know and understand, we are at least above the average level. We must think about how we can be worthy of our own knowledge and abilities. How can we be worthy of the education and training we have received? How can we be worthy of our country, our nation, and the era in which we live? Especially important is what attitude should these many women's groups take to contribute to the general compatriots?</p>
<p>I will tell you a story. I remember when Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands was young, her father had already passed away. One day, on her tenth birthday, her mother held a celebration for her, and tens of thousands of men and women came to the palace to congratulate her. The young queen saw this enthusiastic scene and was very happy and moved. She said to her mother, "Do these people belong to us?" Her mother said, "No, they do not belong to you, but you belong to them." I hope that the women compatriots present today will also recognize that we belong to the people, not that the people belong to us. When we do everything, we must not think that we can control the people, but we must think that we are servants of the people. We must approach the people, go deep among the people, and sincerely serve our compatriots, educate them, help them, relieve their pain, and create their happiness.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period, the welfare of the country and the people is consistent. If we cannot win the war of resistance, our nation will not survive. If our national construction is not successful, we will not have any happiness. Today, our female compatriots must all measure the size of their knowledge and abilities and determine the weight of their responsibilities. The greater one's knowledge and ability, the greater one's responsibility. We must have enthusiasm, perseverance, methods, and, even more so, organization, to take on all kinds of work related to the war of resistance. We must promote thrift, encourage production, advance social education, preside over relief efforts, encourage joining the army to kill [the enemy], and assist in the war of resistance propaganda.

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] Regarding the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin placing barbed wire around foreign concessions, the British Consul there has lodged another protest. The British government also lodged a protest with the Tokyo government on the same day. According to responsible sources here, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, lodged a protest with the Japanese government a few days ago.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Tianjin dispatch: It is reported that the British and French consular authorities met with the Japanese authorities yesterday, stating that the British and French authorities had previously issued a formal note pointing out the Japanese side's placement of obstacles around the British and French concessions. They specifically requested the Japanese side to explain who this action was aimed at and when it would be removed. However, no response has been received to date, and a prompt reply is requested. For several days, the obstacles near the concessions have not only not been removed but have also increased compared to the past. Reuters reporters recently inspected the boundaries of the concessions and saw that the British and French concessions had become a large-scale concentration camp (referring to the British and French concessions being surrounded on all sides by the Japanese). Wire mesh and other obstacles are piled up outside the boundaries, blocking all passages except for a few important roads. On both sides of the roads, there are armed Japanese sentries and a large number of Chinese police. So far, the Japanese side has not interfered with traffic inside and outside the concessions. A key stronghold near the concessions has a machine gun emplacement, which is very eye-catching. Electric fences have also been placed on the streets of various special districts near the concessions. Residents must navigate the electric fences when going out and returning home, like entering a maze, which is extremely inconvenient. Within the Japanese-occupied area, brick buildings have been erected on the main roads, occupying a large area, like barracks. In addition, sentry posts have been placed on the roads, making the roads narrower and causing great inconvenience to traffic. According to external reports, a bridge is being added between the Japanese concessions, leading to speculation among foreign communities here. It is said that the Japanese side plans to add a bridge south of the British concession so that all ships can be diverted to Special District 1. This area has become extremely prosperous since the Japanese side began large-scale development. These rumors have not yet been officially confirmed. However, Japanese bridge-building experts have now come to Tianjin, and a large quantity of materials for bridge construction is piled up in Special District 1. The location where the materials are piled up is near the rumored bridge site, indicating that the rumors are likely to be true. Failure to instigate Wu Peifu</p>

<h3 id="e15">Xiang-Gui Waterway Project <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Changren</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin Shipping News] In the 1940s, transportation, in terms of space, has developed from land and water to the sky; in terms of time, transportation has progressed to speeds that are difficult for the human body to endure. However, due to the two inversely proportional principles of the faster the speed, the lighter the load, and the faster the speed, the greater the cost, most transportation still seeks development in terms of heavy load and cost savings. For example, automobiles are indeed perfect tools in terms of heavy load and speed; however, the goods carried by twenty automobiles can be transported by just one railway freight car. Similarly, the goods that two hundred, or even four hundred or eight hundred, automobile drivers can carry can be transported by just two or three large railway drivers. In this way, the freight rate of trains is much cheaper than that of automobiles. Conversely, if the time allows for the use of shipping for the goods carried by a train, then even if one hundred steamboats or one thousand sailboats are used, low freight rates can still be achieved. This is one of the reasons for the competition between various countries in the world for shipping.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the importance of transportation in wartime. The purpose of war is to compete for time and space, and transportation is a means of this competition. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, our country has learned many lessons in this regard and has been striving to make up for the deficiencies in this area. Our country's air transport encountered setbacks during the period of development due to the war. Although it is still trying to develop under the threat of a superior enemy air force, the flight routes have actually been shortened quite a bit. After entering the second phase of the War of Resistance, railway transportation also greatly reduced its capacity due to the continuous occupation of railway lines. From now on, almost 80% of the transportation will have to rely on automobile transportation. In our current situation where we cannot manufacture automobiles ourselves and cannot refine gasoline ourselves, both military and economic aspects are considerably affected. For example, transporting a truckload of ammunition from Kunming to Changsha, according to a person in charge of automobile transportation, "one-third of the load capacity of a truck has to be used to carry gasoline; and because the roads are not as perfect as imagined, one-third of the life of a truck is shortened as a result." Extrapolating from this phenomenon, our consumption on automobile transportation in this phase of the War of Resistance must be very alarming.</p>
<p>Military authorities have long been concerned about this. In the Eastern Theater, the Lunan Battlefield, and various battles along the Yangtze River, in addition to using railways and highways as much as possible, water transport was more fully utilized. Furthermore, it was anticipated that the development of the war would inevitably enter the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the lower reaches of the Pearl River; at the same time, southern Hunan and Guangxi would inevitably be the sites where our troops must fight and defend, and must win. Therefore, starting in the first half of last year, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission was instructed to begin planning and carrying out the Xiang-Gui Waterway Project, hoping to connect the Yangtze River and the Pearl River in an "I" shape, like the Grand Canal connecting the Hai River, the Yellow River, and the Yangtze River, to compensate for the lack of and damage to railway and highway transportation and to increase the convenience of military and civilian transport.</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Waterway starts from Changsha in the north and reaches Cangwu, where the Gui River and the West River converge, in the south, with a total length of over 1,000 kilometers, almost the sum of the total lengths of the Xiang River, Li River, and Gui River. The traffic situation in the basin of this waterway is mostly the same as that of the canal basin between Jiangxu Wu County (Suzhou) and Jiaxing, Zhejiang, with parallel railway lines, highway lines, and waterways intersecting each other. The Xiang River and the Li River both originate in the Xing'an Mountains in northern Guangxi, flowing north and south, with one branch connecting them. Above Hengyang, the Xiang River can only be used by civilian boats. Between Weiyang and Changsha, small steamboats operate during the flood season in spring and summer; below Changsha, there are no Yangtze River steamers passing through. The Li River is a section of waterway from Xing'an through Guilin to [illegible] Le. Above Guilin, there is little benefit of boat travel during the dry season; between Guilin and Pingle, the deepest point is no more than four or five feet, and the shallowest point is only one or two feet. The river surface is about half a li wide in wide places and four or five zhang wide in narrow places, and it can be crossed on foot. Therefore, electric boats can only pass for two months of the year, and civilian boats pass at other times. The waterway between Pingle and Cangwu is called the Gui River, and the waterway gradually widens and deepens. However, because there are more shoals than in the Li River, electric boats can only pass for four months of the year throughout the year.</p>
<p>From the above description, it can be known that the section of the Xiang-Gui Waterway from Hengyang to Pingle is the most difficult, especially near Xing'an, which serves as the watershed. The waterways are still in their natural state, unlike the Yangtze River, which has been artificially dredged and constrained. Therefore, the "canalization" and "governance" of river management can be used together.</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Waterway Project Office, under the command of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, was established on September 1st last year. The director is Zhang Hanying. The official work started in late September. Because it was to meet the urgent needs of the second phase [of the war], and because engineering materials such as mixed concrete, steel bars, and steel plates had to be given priority for military use, fundamental work could not be carried out. The "control section" of 150 kilometers in Guilin County—that is, the waterway near the Xing'an watershed to the north and south—which was started to be surveyed in May last year, was also partially improved: increasing the water depth of the navigation channel during low water to eight public inches (approximately two feet or so). One is to shorten the transportation time, and the other is to increase the water transport weight. As for the Li River, sluice gates must be built above Guilin and the channel must be deepened so that work can continue to be implemented after completion.</p>
<p>The partial improvement project from Darongjiang north of Guilin to Daxu south of Guilin is currently underway. This includes four projects: dredging the navigation channel, diverting the flow, installing capstans, and blasting rocks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to recruit workers, so large-scale construction cannot be carried out. However, more than 20 projects can still be completed by the end of April this year. Early May to the end of September is the flood season, and next year's work will begin in October. It is hoped that this section of the project can be completed in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Xiang-Gui Waterway Project is not only to connect the Yangtze River and the Pearl River and to open up a new era in inland navigation; its greater role is to have the mission of connecting international inland navigation. The mainstream of the upper reaches of the West River, from Cangwu to Guiping, is called the Xun River; from Guiping to Yongning (Nanning) to the west, it is called the Yu River; from [illegible] Ning to the west to Long [illegible], it is called the Li River (Zuojiang). One source of the Li River is the Guixi border area, which flows into French Annam near the Pingmeng Pass and re-enters the country near the Shuikou Pass; the other is the Jixi in Annam, which flows into the country near the Pingnan Fan and converges in Longjin. Although there is little convenience of navigation on the river channel above Longjin, Longjin is the southernmost major city on the extension line of the Xiang-Gui Railway, only more than 50 kilometers away from Annam. If the waterway project in this area is completed, the international transportation in our southwest will inevitably be changed again; at the same time, the value of the Pearl River, one of the four major rivers in our country, will also be re-evaluated.</p>

<p>[Japanese] Puppet Exchange Control; Aim is to Expel Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 8th] A business leader here told reporters that the North China puppet government's measures to restrict import and export trade are aimed at forcing foreign banks to use puppet currency and exchange it for exchange rates that they cannot currently obtain. Since the Chinese government's banknotes are circulating in the interior, it is doubtful whether this restriction will be effective. If foreign governments recognize this restriction, the business interests of foreigners in North China, which have been built up over many years, will be constrained by others. "The puppet state of Manchukuo can serve as a warning. Although this new restriction is said to be seeking cooperation with foreigners, its ultimate purpose is to weaken foreign interests and benefit Japan. Therefore, the only appropriate action is for various countries to take retaliatory measures against Japanese commerce."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] U.S. President Roosevelt told the press today that if the United States must have a national vote before declaring war, then the defense of the United States will easily be undermined by any such law. He seems to believe that representative government should be applied to war as it is applied to other matters. The defense or major interests of the United States will be undermined by "quasi-war" acts.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Rear Admiral Leahy commented to reporters today on Japan's desire to achieve naval equality with Britain and the United States within six years, saying, "If other countries want to increase their naval strength, then the United States must also increase its naval strength." He then went on to disclose the results of the recent U.S. naval exercises in the Caribbean. It is reported that attacking destroyers and submarines have invaded several points in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and northeastern Haiti, but no ship has been able to invade the United States. According to the [illegible] Daily, Rear Admiral Leahy said that he believes that the U.S. Navy should be ready at any time to uphold national policy. If U.S. national policy includes maintaining commerce, then the Navy should be prepared to protect it. He also said that he believes that the U.S. Navy is sufficient to deal with any combined fleet attacking the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Passes Army Expansion Bill</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Cooke testified before the Senate Naval Committee today, strongly advocating the establishment of an air base on Guam as an "outpost."

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The U.S. Senate today passed the government's 72 million pound army expansion bill by a large majority. The bill will largely realize President Roosevelt's 110 million pound defense plan. The bill has now been submitted to a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives for discussion to adjust differences of opinion. Also, yesterday the Senate passed a bill authorizing the Army Department to have 6,000 aircraft, while the House of Representatives previously passed a bill authorizing only 5,500 aircraft. A joint conference of the two houses will also try to reconcile this difference. The Senate has agreed to limit the aircraft funding in the Army expansion bill to 60 million pounds and has agreed to limit the profits of aircraft manufacturers and others from contracts under this bill to 10%.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] U.S. Democratic Senator Barkley explained in the Senate yesterday that the purpose of President Roosevelt's foreign policy is to maintain peace in the Western Hemisphere and also to contribute to world peace. The United States is unwilling to intervene in European problems by force, but if its own interests are threatened, it will rise up to protect them. Navy Rear Admiral Cooke told the Senate Naval Committee that Guam could become a "lookout post" for the U.S. Navy after it is fortified. Also, during a debate in the Senate today, Senator Clark said that President [Roosevelt] had never implemented the Neutrality Act after the Sino-Japanese War broke out. Senator Barkley said that it is questionable whether the President has the right to decide to implement the Neutrality Act in a state of undeclared war.</p>

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3 id="e33">US Aggressively Expanding Military <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>On the 7th, US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy, in response to Japan's announcement of expanding its navy within six years, stated, "If a foreign country materially strengthens its naval power, the US Navy must also increase its strength." This clearly expresses the US's determination to resist Japan. On the same day, the US Senate passed the government's proposed 72 million pound army expansion bill by an absolute majority, and also passed a bill approving an increase in army aircraft to 6,000. This further indicates that the US government, as fascist aggressors intensify their adventurist policies, has determined its resolve to deal with them with strength. This serves as a strong contrast and admonition to the continued blind actions of some democratic and peaceful countries that vainly hope for peace through compromise and concession. However, "successful resistance cannot be carried out in isolation." Therefore, cooperation between the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union in the necessary anti-aggression war should be the urgent international task at hand. Former US Secretary of State Stimson's call the other day for democratic countries such as the US, Britain, and France to unite in resisting aggressor nations can be considered the most urgent and humane call of the moment.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Japan's Provocations Against the Soviet Union <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, Japan has intensified its provocations against the Soviet Union over the fishing grounds issue, and the Soviet Union's extremely tough attitude towards the Japanese emissaries has caused international concern about a major war in the Far East.</p>
<p>Japan's new provocations are clearly intended to create a serious atmosphere, first to ease domestic anti-war sentiment, and second to respond to Italy and Germany and even to deceive Britain and France. The Soviet Union's tough attitude will not only fail to promote a major war in the Far East but will also be enough to prevent the expansion of such a war. Japan will not dare to take risks under the Soviet Union's tough attitude, which is to be expected.</p>
<p>Therefore, with regard to the increasingly tense relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, we should pay attention to the following: first, Japan's provocation against the Soviet Union will, on the one hand, be a preliminary step toward a greater offensive against China, and on the other hand, will practically intensify its southward strategy, and from the international aspect and the activities of Chinese traitors, attempt to realize the cessation of our country's resistance! Second, the Soviet Union's toughness is sufficient to express the Soviet Union's attitude of "not threatening other countries nor being threatened," with its strong strength as its backing, and has great significance for assisting our country's resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Japan's Financial Crisis <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi Chang, Original author Kurt Bloch, published in the February issue of Asia-America Magazine</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War was due to Japan's aggression because Japan did not want China to move towards unification and unity, so it launched this destructive war. As the war expands and prolongs day by day, we can clearly see that Japan is not only fighting China alone but also fighting against the powers' interests in China. The Munich Agreement and the division of Czechoslovakia gave Japan's strategic work no small encouragement. Therefore, Japanese Foreign Minister Ugaki, who advocated maintaining friendly relations with Britain and the United States, did not receive the support of the military and was forced to step down, and was succeeded by Arita, who publicly advocated the abolition of the "Open Door" policy in April 1938. Soon Japan began to attack Guangzhou, threatening Hong Kong. Therefore, it was no accident that the US government issued a diplomatic note to Japan on October 6 last year, maintaining the "Open Door." Of course, Japan's response was still ambiguous, but according to Japan's semi-official rhetoric, it has clearly stated that Japan intends to monopolize China.</p>
<p>This threat to the interests of the powers cannot be said to be insignificant. Since the outbreak of the war caused by the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan has borrowed from Germany through "Manchukuo." According to general estimates, the amount of debt is at least about 45 million US dollars. It is very obvious that this is a war debt. Of course, Germany will therefore enjoy certain preferential and special rights and interests. The Japanese representative of the South Manchuria Railway in Germany has also firmly promised Germany and Italy special rights in China. However, Germany is preparing for a large-scale European war, and its economic and commercial situation is deteriorating day by day, and its export capacity has also been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway has recently requested a loan of 2.5 million US dollars from the United States for railway equipment, but it has not been successful. In addition, the general manager of the Manchuria Industrial Development Corporation has also set off to the United States, hoping to obtain the cooperation of American manufacturers to develop Manchuria's automobile, steel, iron, and coal industries. These are all military-related industries. The automobile industry can mechanize the Japanese army. The development of the steel and iron industry can make Japan not have to purchase from the United States. The development of Manchuria's coal mines can also alleviate Japan's coal shortage. However, Japan's consumption is very large, and various industries in Manchuria are also obviously unstable, so this matter has little hope of success. On the contrary, at the very time that Japan's attempt to borrow from the US failed, the Washington Export-Import Bank, under the jurisdiction of the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation, allowed China a large amount of credit loans, totaling 25 million US dollars, to exchange American agricultural and industrial products for Chinese tung oil (tung oil is an important raw material for quick-drying paint needed by the US automobile industry). Similarly, the British government adopted a "parallel action" by lending 500,000 pounds to China through the Export Credits Guarantee Department to develop trade and transportation between Burma and China. Several days later, the US Secretary of the Treasury declared that the Chinese government had a large amount of gold reserves stored in the United States as collateral, and the US government was preparing to expand loans to China.</p>
<p>Of course, Japan severely attacked the British and American moves to loan money to China. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita criticized the US loan to China, saying: "This is an inappropriate move by the United States. The US newspapers believe that the United States opposes Japan, so it has adopted this political attitude; I think this is an extremely dangerous attitude. Japan can consider this an economic pressure on Japan. The results expected by the United States will not be realized." At the same time, he further stated that the foreign concessions and extraterritorial rights in China should be abolished, and the economic activities of foreign businessmen should also be subject to certain restrictions.</p>
<p>At that time, the puppet governments in Beijing, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou, all controlled by Japan, held a joint meeting to discuss protesting the British and American loans to China and considering retaliatory measures. A Japanese military spokesman informally stated that these loans would only extend the war, which was about to end, to the summer and would not be very effective. This statement is very interesting and happens to contradict Japan's declaration on its China policy, as if admitting that by the summer of 1939, Japan's economic and financial situation would be close to collapse and it would not be able to defeat China. On the other hand, military experts unanimously believe that the Chinese army has moved inland, maintaining its strength. Japan's heavy artillery and mechanized units have gradually become ineffective. Under these circumstances, Japan cannot win. Recently, the situation has changed, and the wavering attitude of Britain and the United States has gradually strengthened, deciding to financially aid China, and can compete with Germany's financial aid to Japan. This is naturally gratifying to China. From the perspective of Britain and the United States, this is nothing strange. Not long before the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the British Export Credits Guarantee Department established a special office in Shanghai to promote trade between Britain and China. The US Washington Export-Import Bank also approved a loan to China for the first time around this time to sell 20 railway locomotives to the Chinese Ministry of Railways. Therefore, the current loans from Britain and the United States to China are merely a continuation of the economic policy of 1937.</p>
<p>The situation in East Asia has undergone new developments. The return of Britain and the United States to the economic policy of 1937 is very important. In 1937, Britain and the United States loaned money to China because they thought that China was a country with strong manpower and poor military equipment, and hoped that by providing financial assistance, it could gradually prosper and become an excellent market. However, at the end of 1938, the views of Britain and the United States on Japan and China had changed dramatically. A year and a half of war proved that China's military equipment was not as weak as they had imagined in 1937. Similarly, a year and a half of war also proved that Japan's military equipment was not as strong as it boasted and could not establish a new order in East Asia. On the contrary, Japanese officers do not have abundant military knowledge and economic knowledge, and even pro-Japanese Germany strictly criticizes the Japanese army. The political situation is also like this. The current politics in the occupied areas of China are darker and more turbulent than at any time in Chinese history. Unfortunately, the dreamy Japanese leaders have not seen this fact, have not discovered the terrible Japanese crisis, which is why it has repeatedly angered the powers, creating reasons for itself.</p>
<p>In April 1938, Arita sternly opposed the "Open Door" policy. After he took office as Foreign Minister, he still did not change his opinion, although the tone was slightly milder. On the other hand, the "victories" announced by the Japanese military leaders in China can only obtain the remaining remnants of Chinese soil to supply friendly Germany, Italy, and enterprises under Japanese control. At the same time, they are also doing their best to drive out foreign industries and commerce. Western countries have realized that the freedom of trade with China and the development of commercial interests can only be obtained from the central government of China. This situation is created by Japan, and the Japanese can only blame themselves.</p>
<p>The US loans to China are based on its long-standing traditional foreign policy. The United States has always been friendly to China, and the American churches in China often assist China. In the great flood of the Yangtze River in 1931, the US Farm Bureau lent 15 million US dollars to China. In 1933, after attending the London World Economic Conference, Song Ziwen arrived in the United States and obtained a loan of 50 million US dollars for cotton and wheat. From 1933 to 1934, China obtained loans of 17 million US dollars from the United States and established the "China Economic Committee." The US silver policy in 1936 significantly affected China's finances. The United States continued to purchase silver, effectively helping China consolidate its monetary foundation. When the US Import-Export Bank approved a loan to China for locomotives, Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and the US Secretary of the Treasury agreed that China would purchase substantial gold from the US. Therefore, it is not surprising that this new US loan, guaranteed by the Bank of China, will mutually exchange goods between the US and China.</p>
<p>It is obvious that China's new loans have greatly disappointed Japan. Since the Munich Conference, the fascist tripartite group thought it could run rampant throughout the world. However, the facts have clearly told Japan that the British and Americans have financially supported China, and the dream of controlling all of China is difficult to realize. Moreover, China can obtain effective assistance from the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Japanese army has made no new progress since capturing Guangzhou and Hankou. Guangzhou is often threatened by counterattacks from the elite Chinese army. The attacks on Jiangxi and Hunan provinces have also stalled. Several attempts to attack western China and cut off China's transportation links with the Soviet Union have long failed. Economically, the result of developing China's resources is nothing more than adding to the disappointment, because Chinese farmers and workers are refusing to cooperate. In the "Manchukuo," the lack of manpower is very obvious, local peace cannot be maintained, and it is often threatened by the Eighth Route Army—all of these are preventing the development of Manchuria. As for Japan itself, the war has brought the people intolerable hardships. The mysterious fires and explosions can lead us to believe that the "silent masses" of Japan cannot remain silent forever.</p>
<p>Now is the best time for China to receive financial assistance, and it is also the best time for the powers to provide assistance. Japan is anxious to win before this summer and is gradually feeling uneasy, because the "China Incident" will be prolonged for longer than Japan's financial strength can support. The British and American loans to China, whether commercial or political, are indeed a blow to Japan.</p>

<p>Distributes to Five Women's Organizations</p>
<p>Madam Sun Soong Ching-ling then stepped onto the stage amid applause and said, "When I came to Hong Kong from Shanghai, I often heard statements that the work of women's organizations here was scattered and disorganized. At that time, I felt that it was indeed necessary to unite because unity is strength. Since the establishment of the Sino-American-French Charity Bazaar Committee, I have learned of the efforts of various organizations. To express my gratitude, I especially represent the Sino-American-French Bazaar Committee to present banners to the Women's Comfort Association, the War Relief Association, the New Movement Association, the Women's Association, and the Young Women's Christian Association," etc. The banners were made of red satin and praised as "Striving for National Salvation."

<p>The ocean liner Empress of Britain, renowned as a "floating hotel" of over 40,000 tons, arrived in Hong Kong for its eighth around-the-world voyage yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, anchoring at the Kowloon Wharf. The ship departed from New York on January 7th, sailing east across the Atlantic Ocean, through the Mediterranean Sea and India to reach Hong Kong. The ship's facilities are magnificent and unparalleled. Passengers can tour the world's famous cities, expanding their knowledge, and can avoid feeling lonely during the long journey. There are a total of 150 tourists on this trip, most of whom are wealthy Americans, and many are repeat visitors returning to familiar places. The rest are mostly wealthy merchants from European countries and Canada. Among them are Mr. and Mrs. Robert Titterton, Mrs. Louis Brown, and Mrs. McIntyre, all of whom are well-known figures in the United States. Several people are traveling in the most luxurious cabins, with fares reaching $66,000. The ship will stay in Hong Kong for four days. The China Navigation Company has already arranged sightseeing itineraries and social events in Hong Kong. It has been learned that 30 passengers will transfer to the Empress of Japan in Hong Kong to return to the East. Due to the current situation, this voyage has decided to cancel the trips to Shanghai and Japan, and instead go to South America. After leaving Hong Kong, the ship will sail to Manica and the Dutch East Indies, and then head to South America, passing through Havana and returning to New York, arriving in Southampton again on May 24th. After the ship arrived in Hong Kong at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the tourists disembarked to sightsee at 8:45 AM. Many speculators first displayed various goods for sale at Bridge No. 5. Stalls selling antiques and sandalwood canes were everywhere around the bridge. Antique shops outside the Kowloon Wharf also displayed new items to attract the attention of the tourists. About 60 to 90 cars were waiting to transport them to tour Hong Kong and Macau. Hundreds of rickshaws were waiting outside the wharf to be hired. The crowded situation was unprecedented.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese army stepped into South China, Hong Kong's land and water transportation with the mainland has been cut off, with only the Hong Kong-Macau route still able to communicate with the mainland. Furthermore, the coastal roads in Eastern Guangdong, Chaoshan, and Southern Guangdong have been destroyed, causing great inconvenience. Coupled with the recent escalation of naval blockades in the South, the import of foreign goods and industrial products from Hong Kong to the mainland has come to a standstill. According to people in the industry who have been importing foreign goods and Hong Kong-made products, the business of most companies has been suspended for the past three to four months. Nowadays, foreign goods are rarely seen in the markets of the four rural districts of the mainland. Foreign companies and agents in Hong Kong have suffered significant setbacks. At the same time, many small industrial factories in Hong Kong, which rely on the mainland market as their backbone, have also been significantly affected. In order to maintain their own businesses, in addition to reducing the number of employees and saving daily expenses, they are actively seeking development in Southeast Asia, selling their products in large quantities to Southeast Asia to offset past losses.</p>

<p>At 1:50 AM yesterday, Chinese police officers Yang Jiu and Wu Hua from the Lok Ma Chau Police Station in the New Territories were patrolling outside San Tin Village when they suddenly saw three robbers dressed in black approaching. Their movements were unusually furtive. The two police officers were highly suspicious and immediately shouted to question them, intending to search them. Unexpectedly, before the two police officers finished shouting, the three robbers quickly dispersed and opened fire on the police officers, almost ambushing them. At that time, the two police officers, for self-defense, also drew their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged shots, and the gunfire sounded like a string of pearls. The villagers, startled by such loud gunfire in the middle of the night, thought that a major incident had occurred and woke up from their dreams, quietly watching to see what was happening. After more than ten minutes, the gunfire stopped. The three robbers had already disappeared without a trace after the gunfire stopped. Yang and Wu pursued them without success and returned to the station to report. The officer on duty, deeply concerned that the criminals might be plotting something sinister in the middle of the night, immediately mobilized all Chinese and Indian detectives to search the area, but the three robbers had already vanished.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Commemoration of "March 8th" <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Xia</p>
<p>A Lively Scene That Set a Record for the Hong Kong Women's Movement</p>
<p>As the War of Resistance has entered a more difficult stage, "March 8th" International Women's Day has arrived again. In order to further awaken women of all social strata in Hong Kong and embark on the path of freedom and liberation, more than forty women's organizations in Hong Kong have united together to plan and expand the commemoration of this day of women's liberation. The commemoration meeting was held at Lee Theatre. Chinese women leaders and all the women leaders in Hong Kong gathered together, a lively situation that created a new record in the history of the Hong Kong women's movement.</p>
<p>It was a clear morning. In the Lee Theatre by Jardine's Corner, female students wearing blue school uniforms, female workers wearing new homespun clothes, and women leaders wearing floral red, purple, and green gowns, groups of people, one after another, gathered. Before long, the second floor and the lobby were already densely packed.</p>
<p>Standing at attention in silence, the opening ceremony proceeded item by item. Next, Chairperson He Yuying delivered the opening address. A middle-aged woman of short stature took the stage with a dignified and gentle demeanor. In a fluent and brisk tone, she first described the origin of the March 8th International Women's Day, and put forward the "two major goals of the March 831 Women's Day" which are to protect women's rights and improve women's status. Then she explained that the world war situation is so dangerous, and women all over the world should actively stand up to uphold justice, promote peace, and practice self-discipline and service. If the women of the world, who account for half of humanity, can do this, the days of human mutual massacre may be avoided.</p>
<p>Speaking of the status of women in Hong Kong, she believes that it has improved a lot. At the same time, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, women in Hong Kong can unite even more to donate money, donate medicine, raise orphans, and carry out various national salvation movements. This is a good phenomenon in Hong Kong's women's community. "However, that is still not enough!" She emphasized, "We should more deeply recognize that the War of Resistance period is an opportunity for women to seek liberation. Therefore, we must be more diligent and self-sacrificing. In the era of the great War of Resistance, we can share the joys and sorrows with men and share the hardships together. In the new China in the future, we will definitely be able to share glory and rights with men." She finished in one breath and sat down amidst continuous applause!</p>
<p>Next was a speech by Ms. He Xiangning. She is a pioneer in the Chinese women's liberation movement, and it is unnecessary for us to further introduce her. Although she is so old and her hair is already gray, her bright eyes, her lively mouth, and her fighting spirit all demonstrate the vitality of youth. She moved to the front and first talked about the history of "March 8th" Women's Day in China. Then she said, "When we commemorate the fallen soldiers and the deceased compatriots for three minutes, in that moment, we think of our sisters in the occupied areas, ××××××××××××××, and we feel infinitely sad and infinitely painful. We must resolve to avenge their humiliation, ×××××!" She spoke these words with too much force. Have you ever seen the tension of a warrior at the moment of life and death, when he is writing his will? "×××"! Everyone in the audience felt their blood rushing and their hair standing on end!</p>
<p>Speaking of how we women should strive to fight, she took a light breath and said, "We certainly want to fight for our equal status with men, but this is only for personal enjoyment, only for personal gain. If we want to achieve our freedom and equality, we must first obtain the freedom and equality of the nation." A burst of warm applause interrupted her. "I hope that everyone present today, especially the students, will actively promote and awaken all the women in Hong Kong, and extend it further to awaken the women all over the country, and rise up to fight for the freedom and equality of the nation!" She said forcefully, her hands trembling with excitement.</p>
<p>Speaking of the women residing in Hong Kong, she said in a sad tone, "Although the women residing in Hong Kong are so close to the motherland, the tragic facts can almost be heard and seen, but what I know is that many women are still indulging in pleasure day and night, pleasure!" Saying this, many people in the audience looked around, as if searching for something. In fact, some people were already blushing. In a calm atmosphere, she continued: "I hope everyone can wake up in time and use this kind of useful money to help our suffering compatriots and contribute to the country."</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of everyone," but the responsibility of women can be said to be even greater than that of men. How can this be said? If all the men in the country are killed, we women in the rear will also need to go to the front line to fight. I think that on average, one in ten women is pregnant, and that will add hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a few years!" A burst of light laughter interrupted her. After a pause, she continued: "I hope the female compatriots will rise up to fight!" The applause was as intense as firecrackers during the New Year. Almost everyone in the audience was moved to tears.</p>
<p>After the speech, the resolution to send a telegram to the National Government and the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission was passed. Everyone in the audience warmly applauded in support. At this time, Ms. He Xiangning stood up, ran to the microphone, and shouted loudly, "Starting from today, should all the women's organizations in Hong Kong commemorating the March 8th Festival form a Hong Kong Women's National Salvation Federation?" Good! Another burst of warm applause!</p>
<p>During Ms. He Xiangning's speech, Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, quietly arrived. Thousands of eyes were fixed on her, as if she possessed rare treasures. She humbly sat in the third row of chairs. Unable to resist the earnest invitations from everyone, she finally took the stage and sat down. She was wearing a black cheongsam and a flannel coat, showing her calm dignity. She always smiled when talking to people, revealing her snow-white teeth. Her attitude was so gentle and amiable. Every word and gesture vividly demonstrated her unwavering vitality. The impression she gave us was noble, amiable, great, and outstanding.</p>
<p>The reporter asked her to express her opinion on the Hong Kong women's movement. She hesitated for a moment and said, "She has an article to publish about this tomorrow, so she has no opinion!" In fact, she didn't say much at the meeting because she doesn't like to talk much! Only when she presented banners to the three women's associations did she simply say, "During the Sino-British-French association, the five women's organizations united together and were able to exert their great working efficiency!" Although these were just a few words, they were weighty. The women's organizations in Hong Kong really need to unite and fight!</p>
<p>After the awards ceremony, the commemoration came to an end. Then there was entertainment. The one-act play "Chinese Sons and Daughters" was performed by the Guangdong Opera Association, and the results and effects were very satisfactory. Madam Sun and Mrs. Peel also stayed to enjoy the show. After the play ended and the audience dispersed, the commemoration of the March 8th Festival came to an end. Cai Lusheng</p>
<h3 id="e45">"March 8th" Festival in Ap Lei Chau: An Unprecedented Mass Gathering of Women <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Lusheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, women's organizations in Hong Kong enthusiastically and solemnly held celebrations simultaneously in five districts to commemorate the great anniversary of women around the world fighting for freedom and liberation – "International Women's Day." I attended the celebration in Ap Lei Chau, one of Hong Kong's three major fishing areas, across from Aberdeen, about half an hour's "bus" ride from the central district of Hong Kong. Because of the universality and popularization of the event, it gave the people in this culturally backward fishing area boundless excitement!</p>
<p>The event was sponsored by the "Ap Lei Chau Women's Group," composed of mass women such as fishermen and peddlers, together with intellectual women. The venue was a vast open space surrounded by fishermen drying a lot of seafood. A large bamboo stage was erected at the southern part of the space, and rows of long benches were neatly arranged in front of the stage. In addition to the necessary national flag and the portrait of the Premier hung on the stage, the space below was also filled with colorful slogans, such as: "Remember the March 8th Festival, don't forget the thousands of women at the front being ravaged by the × army; and the thousands of women in the rear being bombed by × planes!" "For the work of resisting Japan and building the nation, we women must work together with men!" "Buy fewer cosmetics and you can increase national strength!" What thought-provoking sentences!</p>
<p>Because the venue was in an open space, anyone could have the opportunity to participate. Before the meeting even started, it was already crowded with people – including the "Tanka women" and peddlers, merchants, and intellectuals who have always been "discriminated" against; and also noble ladies. In Ap Lei Chau, which has always been desolate and remote, this can be considered a grand and unprecedented gathering of women!</p>
<p>At a little after ten in the morning, the conference opened. After the ceremony, Ms. Yu Fengning, the chairman, delivered the opening speech – elaborating on the history and significance of the "March 8th" Festival in a penetrating and detailed manner, which received a lot of warm applause. Following that, Ms. Chen Yun, representing the "March 8th" Preparatory Committee, gave a speech on the progress made in the country in the military and political spheres during the twenty months of the War of Resistance, and the improvement of the international situation; and then on how women should position themselves today to make themselves a "person" and jointly shoulder the sacred task of resisting Japan with men. She also encouraged everyone to learn from the bravery of Zhao Laotaitai, the mother of the guerrillas, and to fight for the liberation of women and the liberation of the nation! This garnered even more enthusiastic applause from the audience.</p>
<p>After several other women representatives also expressed their opinions one after another, the entertainment began. First, the women's group of the Life Choir sang: "The Army Marches On," "We Need War"..., filling the entire venue with a generous and passionate sound that deeply moved everyone. Next was the performance by the Ap Lei Chau Women's Group, a one-act play "Freedom?". It was performed by Ms. Yu Fengning, the chairman of the conference, and Ms. Wu Qianqing, the backbone of the Women's Group, etc. Ms. Wu played a male role in reverse. Although it was difficult to distinguish between male and female, it made many innocent and simple fishermen laugh heartily, but the effect was very good. The third program was "The Cry of Women" performed by Ms. Zheng Min and others from the group. The performance was very energetic. The fourth program was a tableau performance of the Song of the Great Wall. Because the performance was so sincere, not only did the performers cry, but many audience members – especially women, were moved to tears and threw "mao zhi" (small denomination coins) and "cents" onto the stage. There were many other interesting programs, which cannot be fully recorded here due to space constraints. In short, the holding of this conference has awakened the women of Ap Lei Chau – especially the women of the poorer classes – from the darkness. In the near future, they will surely be able to prove in fact how they are following this great March 8th Women's Movement and striving to become a "person" – a healthy "person" who can jointly shoulder the burden of fighting for national freedom and liberation with men!</p>

<h3 id="e46">Guangdong × Has a Major Tendency to Invade the West, We are Determined to Crush the Conspiracy of × to Invade Guilin, Guerrillas are Doubly Active, Repeatedly Annihilating Stubborn × in the Rear, Sanshui × Has Been Peeping and Harassing Our Coastline for Days Without Success <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Xijiang Fast Report] Since the × army on the Xijiang front has recently deployed a unit to increase defenses, they have been busy building pontoon bridges and constructing trenches and fortresses in various strongholds every day, seemingly preparing for a major invasion of the west. Therefore, the defense of the west line has become slightly tense. Generals Rao Xia and Deng Longguang of the Guizhou Province, who are responsible for defending the Xijiang, have requested instructions from He, the Southwest Commander-in-Chief, to seize the opportunity to kill the × enemy. Director Bai has a complete offensive and defensive plan for the military affairs of the Guangdong-West and Jiangnan Roads to crush the conspiracy of the × people to invade Guilin. The following is a record of the recent situation of × and us in Xijiang.</p>
<p>Large Army Guards the Southwest Road of Xijiang</p>
<p>Recently, it was rumored that × chieftain An Tenghui requested from the × headquarters to increase the number of three divisions to Guangdong, attempting to use force to make Guilin. The news was rampant. Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Commander-in-Chief had already made a great determination to aid Guangdong and protect Guilin. No matter whether the Guangdong × invaded Guilin by advancing along the Xijiang River or by landing on the southern road for a roundabout attack, there were strict defenses to prevent them. × will never succeed. The elite Wei Yunsong unit of Guizhou Province has been transferred to Qinzhou and other areas in southern Guangdong to strengthen the defense of the border between Guizhou and Guangdong. Our large army is gathered along the Xijiang River, and the defense is particularly strong. × dare not risk an attack.</p>
<p>Guerrillas Repeatedly Annihilate × in the Rear</p>
<p>After General Deng Longguang, the commander of the × army, moved his troops to the Xijiang River, in order to launch a large-scale guerrilla war to cooperate with the regular army's plan to attack the ×, he recently sent a large number of plainclothes guerrillas to the occupied areas from Sanshui Hekou Southwest to Foshan to carry out extensive propaganda to the villagers and persuade them to join the guerrillas to kill the ×. It is now found that our plainclothes guerrillas have penetrated deep into the rear of the × people and are extremely active. In the Foshan area, the misleading slogans posted by Li Daoyi, the pseudo-administrative commissioner of Nanhai, have been torn down by our guerrillas for days. At the same time, the pseudo-self-defense corps and × sentries have also been repeatedly killed. The × bandits entrenched in Foshan are panicked. Our guerrillas' strategy of disrupting the violent × by penetrating deep into the rear has achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>Sanshui × Army Peeps and Harasses the Coast</p>
<p>It was also found that after the increase of the × troops on the Sanshui front, they have been strengthening their defenses at various strongholds near Hekou, Zhennan, Xinxu, and Ganggen, Makou, Jiaowei, and Laoyazhou for days, and erecting floating bridges. On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month, the Haikou and Ganggen Makou × troops sent infantry and cavalry to forcibly pull laborers from nearby villages to transport wood and erect military bridges. It is estimated that more than 300 people have been forcibly conscripted in recent days. According to intelligence, there are now × motorized boats and rubber boats, Chuan ships, and seven or eight electric boats berthed near Zhennan Xinxu and 口. On the 6th and 9th, the × motorized boats patrolled along the river, searching around Ganggen Makou and the old Ershui Jiaowei Laoyazhou area to search for our guerrillas. On the 6th, some × soldiers from the 墟 area rode motorized boats to Jiaowei to land and increase defenses. That night, two × motorized boats, each carrying dozens of × soldiers, sailed from Jiaowei towards Qingqi, using searchlights to illuminate and spy along the coast. Our sentries, believing that the × boats were harassing, strictly monitored them. The × soldiers, not seeing any movement and not knowing our reality, did not dare to approach the shore and sailed downstream.</p>
<p>Jiujiang Stubborn × Builds Defenses and Guards</p>
<p>Also, on the downstream of the Xijiang River, in the Jiujiang Heqing area, on the 4th, more than 100 × soldiers came to the two Longs from the Jiangfo Lu Ba Jiashui Teng. Currently, there are more than 500 × soldiers in Jiujiang Shakou Heqing. Apart from actively building defenses in recent days, there have been no other unusual movements. On the night of the 5th, more than ten × motorized boats sailed to Jiujiang to unload military supplies and forcibly conscripted our strong men to dig trenches along the coast of Shakou Heqing. There were no other changes. However, there were sporadic gunshots from the front line, which seemed to be fired by our guerrillas attacking the ×.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Our Army on the Northeast Road Liaisons to Encircle Zengcheng, Although × Gathers in Zengcheng, They Dare Not Act Rashly, Dongbao Huibo Are All Solidly Defended <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Shenzhen Quick Report] The situation in Dongjiang has been uncertain for the past week, with frequent troop movements and fluctuating troop strength in the strongholds of Zengcheng, Shilong, Wancheng, and Taiping. Although the situation in the Zeng (cheng) Cong (hua) area seems slightly tense after the recent × gathering of troops in Zengcheng, the Dong (guan) Hui (yang) Bo (luo) area is still extremely peaceful. The military and civilians in various places are busy strengthening their defenses and resisting the ×. The following is a record of the situation in Dongjiang obtained here in the past two days.</p>
<p>Our Army Strictly Controls Zengcheng</p>
<p>It was found that the × army has been transporting troops from the Guangzeng Highway and the Zengtan Highway to Zengcheng, Zengkou, Fuhe, Zhucun, Shiqiao, and Shigang for days, increasing the number of × soldiers. However, Wu Qiwei, the commander-in-chief of our East Road, and Yu Hanmou, the commander-in-chief of the North Road, have already issued orders to transfer elite troops to be stationed in Longmen Boluo Conghua and other areas, adopting close liaison to strictly encircle and control the × army in Zengcheng. It will be difficult for the × to break through and flee. According to information received from a certain agency, the number of × in Zengcheng has increased, but they know that our large army is gathered, so they have not dared to act rashly in the past two days. Our positions are solid and our morale is high.</p>
<p>Dongbao's Defense is Becoming More Stable</p>
<p>In addition, except for Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping, which are occupied by the ×, there are no × traces in the rest of the Dongguan territory, the downstream of the Dongjiang River, Mas, Qishi, Longjiao, Jitou, Tiangang, and Qiaotou. Although the areas adjacent to Dongguan City, Taiping, and Shilong are constantly harassed and threatened by the × army, the × army does not dare to occupy them. The pseudo-maintenance committees of various villages that were threatened by the × a few days ago have now disintegrated one after another, and the people are also enthusiastically joining the guerrillas to kill the ×. Therefore, most of the Dongguan County territory is still in the hands of our army. Zhang Wodong, the deputy commander of the Fourth Guerrilla Area and the county magistrate of Dongguan, is now actively promoting the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Movement among the people in the occupied and non-occupied areas. As for the Baoan County territory, there are no × traces now. The × army has been spreading rumors of a renewed invasion of Baoan every day, but our teams have already strengthened their defenses with real knives. If the × invade, they will be severely attacked at any time. Zhang Wodong Liang 仁 , the two county magistrates, have also been discussing the measures to defend against ×, eliminate bandits, and maintain law and order for days. Therefore, the defense of the two counties of Dongbao is becoming more and more solid.</p>
<p>It is Rumored that More than 10,000 × Troops are Coming to Guangdong for Reinforcement</p>
<p>According to intelligence, An Teng, the head of the southern invasion ×, has requested assistance from the × country in view of the long east, west, and north Jiang front lines after launching the military operation to invade Hainan Island, the insufficient distribution of troops, and the pressure from our large army. In order to consolidate the original points and lines and prevent our large army from attacking and seize the opportunity for a final struggle, many × ships have arrived in the Pearl River one after another, carrying more than 10,000 × soldiers. One part has landed in Huangpu Humen and is reinforcing the east, west, and north Jiangs, and the other part is reinforcing Hainan Island.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The National Economic Construction Commission Promotes International Trade, Organizes Joint Venture Companies, and Will Develop to Overseas Areas <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Correspondence] Since its establishment, the National Economic Construction Commission has been actively promoting the development of domestic economic affairs. In view of improving the quality of domestic goods and promoting the number of outbound sales, it has initiated the organization of a China National Products Joint Venture Company to promote international trade and exchange foreign exchange from overseas. The company's recent work plan is as follows: 1. Prepare for the establishment of national product companies in various places, and formulate the guidelines for the articles of association of national product companies in various places, the "Outline of Joint Taiwan Measures" and the "Organization Procedures." 2. Prepare for the establishment of national product stores in various places, and formulate the "Measures for National Product Stores in Various Places" and the "Outline of Joint Business Measures." 3. Act as an agent for public and private institutions and groups to purchase large quantities of domestic goods, including "Measures for Purchasing Large Quantities of Domestic Goods." 4. Undertake the promotion and sale of domestic goods entrusted by domestic goods manufacturers, and formulate an outline of a promotion cooperation method. Since the War of Resistance, the company, in view of the increasing enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for using domestic goods, has planned to contact local overseas Chinese to jointly initiate organizations in overseas areas in order to promote international trade and exchange foreign exchange. It plans to initiate them in Southeast Asia first, and plans to gradually plan to establish them in places such as Batavia, Manila, and Bangkok. In addition to the company first recognizing one-quarter or one-third of the subscribed capital, the rest will be provided by enthusiastic overseas Chinese or banks in each location. This is really enough to develop international trade and reverse the trade deficit.</p>

<p>The Market Situation Plummeted</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Fifth District of Shunde Suffered a Catastrophe, The Place Has Become a Place of媚 to Seek Full-time Retribution <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Since × occupied the area along the Fojiang Highway in the Fifth District of Shunde, its transportation has been greatly threatened by our guerrillas' attacks and sabotage from time to time. Recently, due to our large-scale counter-offensive, fearing that they would be intercepted by our guerrilla teams when retreating, they dispatched the Nanhai Pseudo-Political Police Force and the original Nanhai Detective Team, etc., a total of about 300 traitors, local bandits, and soldiers, led by the × chieftain, Captain Dashi, claiming to sweep away our guerrilla teams, and肆 to villages near the highway. When × arrived at Xinlong Township, the villagers immediately fled in investigation. Only three servants were guarding the township office. ×</p>
<p>, then proceeded to Dalou Township. When they arrived at the edge of Dalou Township, a local bandit named Li of the township contacted × in the name of the chairman of the township maintenance committee. × then ordered him to lead the way into the village. When they reached the bridgehead in the center of the village, the traitorous bandits and × soldiers looted the property of each store, causing huge losses. After × looted the area, they proceeded to Laocun Township along Daoxiang Township. At that time, the people of Laocun Township did not know that × was acting so × in Dalou Township. Therefore, ×× Lao×× Lao×× Liang and others recognized them as members of the township maintenance committee and went out of the village to greet them in advance. After × entered the village, they made a brief patrol and looted the wealthy households and overseas Chinese residences on Changtang Street, causing a loss of no less than tens of thousands of yuan. One day, × surrounded Yuebu in four routes from Lanshi and Shuiteng. He and other traitors in the township immediately welcomed × into the village in separate ways. After × entered the village, they repeated the old trick and looted the village, even taking away towels and cigarettes. After × finished looting, they fled back to Lanshi along Yuanji. When they arrived at Xiaoyong Township,節After the area was轮 through, farmers and merchants, etc., had already fled. The local security was lacking people in charge, and local bandits took the opportunity to纠 gang and拦 to intercept and rob,打 at night. Those who could not escape had to suffer再 bandits, which can be described as tragic.</p>
<p>The Market Situation Remains Desolate</p>
<p>As for the general market situation, various entertainment venues are still very deserted. × once forced the cinemas to reopen, claiming that if they did not comply, they would强 disturb their business. One was indeed forced at the time, but it was still closed due to the lack of films. Only a few restaurants, such as Jinlong, Jinlun, and Dasanyuan, are open. Although some stores have reopened, most of them have been forced to. Guangzhou used to have many foreign goods stores, but now they have been replaced by hundreds of × stores, selling × goods.</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Food Problem in Chaozhou <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenqiang</p>
<p>The grain production in Chaozhou and Shantou is not as much as the people of Chaozhou and Shantou eat. The insufficient amount has always been supplied by importing national rice from southern Fujian and various provinces in the Yangtze River Basin, as well as rice from 安 两 , Siam, Yangon and other places. Therefore, before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Chaozhou and Shantou, due to their geographical location on the coast and convenient transportation, could always get a continuous supply of foreign rice regardless of the local harvest, with only expensive rice and no rice famine. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, especially after the abandonment of Wuhan and the fall of Guangzhou, the transportation lines between Chaozhou and Shantou and the domestic rice-producing areas, except for a corner of southern Fujian, have been cut off by the enemy, and it is extremely difficult to transport foreign rice into Chaozhou and Shantou. The cost of various foreign rice has skyrocketed due to the relative devaluation of the national currency, and the cost calculated in foreign currency has skyrocketed. The price of sales in the country is too high, and merchants have no profit to seek, and imports have almost disappeared. Therefore, three months ago, even shortly after the winter harvest in Chaozhou and Shantou, the price of rice skyrocketed unprecedentedly, with each yuan buying only six or seven catties or so. The increased burden on the poor and the difficulty of life have been enough to weaken the strength of the War of Resistance. In the future, there will be more and more rice shortages. If the people's food is cut off, the self-reliance of Chaozhou and Shantou, and even the overall situation of the War of Resistance, will be affected. The food problem in Chaozhou and Shantou is really very serious and worthy of everyone's attention, research, and solutions.</p>
<p>At present, the food problem in Chaozhou and Shantou only has the phenomenon of expensive rice and has not yet developed into the degree of rice famine. Stabilizing the price of rice and relieving the suffering of the people is indeed the urgent demand of the people. How to prevent rice famine is even more of a "sufficient food" problem that is as important as "sufficient soldiers" in today's increasingly urgent policy of the enemy's southward invasion!</p>
<p>The population of Chaozhou and Shantou is about 4.5 million, and the annual consumption of rice is about 9.157 million dan. The rice produced by each county in Chaozhou and Shantou is only 7.4 million dan per year, with a deficit of about 1.75 million dan. In addition, most of the rice shortage in the counties of Meizhou is also purchased and supplied by rice merchants in Shantou. According to statistics, the amount of rice that needs to be supplemented from outside in Chaozhou and Meizhou each year is about 3.6 million dan. Before foreign rice was taxed, most of these 3.6 million dan of rice were supplied by Annam Siam Yangon and other places. After foreign rice was taxed, most of them were supplied by domestic rice. Xiang rice was transported from Changsha to Shantou via Guangzhou via the Yuehan Railway, and rice from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces was exported from Shanghai and shipped to Shantou by sea. Now that the Guangdong-汉 railway transportation has been interrupted, Xiang rice can absolutely not be transported to Shantou for sale. Although 50,000 to 60,000 bags of rice from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces exported through Shanghai have been transported to Shantou in the past month, which is the largest source of food for Chaozhou and Shantou, the enemy is jealous and has now begun to prevent Su rice from being transported to Shantou. Now the authorities in Fujian Province have also banned the transportation of rice out of the province, and the supply of domestic rice for the people's food in Chaozhou and Shantou has been cut off. If we do not take steps to save the situation as soon as possible, there is indeed a possibility that a severe rice famine will form in Chaozhou and Shantou.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent a rice famine in Chaozhou and Shantou is to open up the source of foreign rice. The reason why foreign rice cannot be imported in large quantities has been mentioned earlier, because the cost is too high. The reason why the cost is high is the high exchange rate and the collection of tariffs. To enable foreign rice to be imported, we must of course find ways to reduce its cost. The level of the exchange rate is a financial problem of the entire country, and it cannot be shifted with the local food problem. To reduce the cost of foreign rice, all we can do is to temporarily exempt the import tax on foreign rice, (to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Wife of an Arms Dealer: Hedy Lamarr <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Twenty-three-year-old Hedy Lamarr is a dazzling, top-tier star in Hollywood, in the United States, and on screens worldwide. However, her past is a heart-wrenching novel. For seven years, she struggled to free herself from dire circumstances, and through her own efforts, she finally turned her long-held dream into reality. Here, we start from her starring role in her first film, "Ecstasy."</p>
<p>At that time, she was only sixteen years old, a girl who didn't fully understand the ways of the world. She signed the acting contract somewhat confusedly, not realizing how much this event would reshape her life. She grew to dislike the nude and romantic scenes in the film, not knowing that this was the starting point for her future fame.</p>
<p>Moreover, this film caused resentment from her parents, especially her father, a distinguished Viennese banker. Hedy said, "Lawyers advised him to make a statement about this, but he refused, because the film wasn't very famous at that time. Doing so would only attract more attention from pleasure-seekers."</p>
<p>He was wrong. The film eventually became a huge sensation in Europe, winning honors. Afterwards, it also gained significant attention in the United States.</p>
<p>After the film was completed, Hedy went to Vienna to live with her parents, hoping to alleviate their worries somewhat. Soon after, she stepped onto the stage, taking on the role of Empress Elisabeth in the local production of "Empress Elisabeth," and received another warm welcome.</p>
<p>Around this time, she often received flowers. Each time, among the large bouquets of fresh flowers, there was always one bouquet with the name "Fritz Mandl" attached. This person requested a meeting with her. Although Hedy remembered having such an admirer, she had never given him a response. Eventually, they finally met at her home, introduced by her mother.</p>
<p>He was a person who never stopped until he achieved his goals. In Europe, his name was often shrouded in an aura of mystery. To put it more clearly, he was a famous arms dealer, a powerful behind-the-scenes figure, a man with a heart of stone.</p>
<p>At their first meeting, he asked her directly, "You've certainly heard of me, haven't you?"</p>
<p>Hedy smiled, "Of course—but not particularly good things."</p>
<p>The environment had changed her, enabling her to skillfully handle every visitor or those who fell in love with her. She always avoided those with obvious ambitions, otherwise, she would face more trouble.</p>
<p>However, upon meeting Fritz, she felt an irresistible force. His formidable intelligence, various talents, love of sports, and his unique, assertive courtship all combined to make him such an active and energetic man that she inevitably, unconsciously, fell in love with him.</p>
<p>The wedding was quiet. Hedy was completely immersed in love, neglecting her future destiny.</p>
<p>After the marriage, Fritz kept her like a caged bird, giving her a separate residence. Everything she wanted, he would fulfill. Well, shouldn't a woman be content with this?</p>
<p>But no, he provided everything she needed, yet he handled these matters in the same way he ran his arms business. This was his biggest mistake. He was the master of his kingdom, giving orders to servants, giving orders to Hedy, giving orders to everyone. He was truly like an emperor, and Hedy was the empress. The empress had no real power.</p>
<p>Could Hedy truly stay in this kind of life for long? She was ambitious and had an early desire to become a Hollywood star. But now, after marriage, she spent her days in this luxurious but unfree life, becoming Fritz's prisoner, slowly being forgotten by the outside world.</p>
<p>Now, Hedy could talk about these things without hesitation, but when she was still a queen in the forbidden palace, she didn't even dare to say an extra word. Her phone was tapped, and she was secretly watched wherever she went. It was absolutely forbidden to dance twice with the same man. Fritz married her to monopolize her, and he wanted her to think the same way. Another woman might have had her life ruined under the same treatment, but not Hedy. Although she had been forced to stay at home, quietly being a prisoner, for quite a long time, she finally couldn't bear it anymore. She wanted to seek help from her parents, but unfortunately, her father was suffering from severe heart disease at that time, so she couldn't even tell him about it. Until one night, her father passed away, she felt that this was the time to escape, otherwise, she would be drowned by the "sea of sorrow" he had created sooner or later.</p>
<p>Even now, Hedy still doesn't dare to reveal who helped her escape from Vienna, and she herself didn't dare to be sure that she was safe until she set foot on the soil of London. This shows how much she feared her husband and his special, prison-like affection.</p>
<p>With a shattered heart, she met the film industry mogul Louis B. Mayer and his wife on the banks of the Thames. The flame of her desire to become a star was rekindled, and wasn't America farther away from her husband? So she immediately decided to sail to America with the Mayers. On the way, at Mrs. Mayer's suggestion, she changed her name from Hedy Kiesler to Hedy Lamarr, the name of the great movie star to come.</p>
<p>When she arrived in Hollywood, she began to study acting and English. Her childishness hadn't changed, and she preferred to go to the cinema to learn English rather than sit face-to-face with her private tutor. Of course, this didn't yield good results, so she couldn't get any roles for a long time. Eventually, even the people at MGM believed that she would soon be sent back to Europe.</p>
<p>About eight months later, she was discovered by Charles Boyer at a party. At that time, he had already been assigned as the male lead in "Algiers," but the female lead had not yet been decided. Hedy had only met him for a short while before he recommended her to Walter Wanger, the producer of the film.</p>
<p>"She's perfect for our female lead, don't you think?"</p>
<p>The producer looked at her and thought that might be true. So Hedy was temporarily borrowed to do a few screen tests with other people. After testing ten people, Hedy was officially borrowed to play the female lead in "Algiers."</p>
<p>As soon as this film came out, her reputation surpassed that of Charles Boyer. Although she had little acting experience and almost no close-ups of her alone in the entire film, the worst criticism against her was only that "she wasn't acting, and the film didn't show that she was a good actress, but we don't care about these things." In the end, she was still embraced.</p>
<p>Frank Borzage is the director of her new film "I Take This Woman." He is trying his best to make this film a great success, and MGM is also paying special attention to her. We hope she has better performances, and her future is limitless.</p>
<p>She has an elegant new house, furnished with the latest furniture, and hopes to bring her mother to live with her as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Because she and Reginal Gardiner are very close, she often visits him in the hospital when he is injured. There is some speculation outside again. However, although Hedy has a passionate personality, she also has a calm judgment. This matter is probably not what people generally think.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Canada, 7th] The father of the world-famous Dionne quintuplets stated today that he does not approve of the authorities' plan to move the five girls to North Bay so that the King and Queen of England can meet them during their tour of Canada. Although he is very willing for his girls to see the King and Queen, he does not want them to be separated. He hopes that the authorities can invite the King and Queen to visit his home.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Hong Kong Football Team to Visit the Philippines in Return Match; Fifteen Players Internally Selected; Li Huitang and Yige Shan'nu Included in the Internal List <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) During the Lunar New Year, the Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-City Football Match saw the Philippine team lose all three games and return south defeated. However, although they gained nothing in the competition, the large number of spectators resulted in ticket revenue totaling over 12,900 yuan for the three games. This excellent result was truly unexpected. Therefore, although the Philippine team suffered complete defeat, they returned satisfied.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team is scheduled to visit the Philippines in return in late April. At yesterday's (6th) General Meeting, it was decided that the Hong Kong team would travel on the President Cleveland ship on April 28 and return to Hong Kong on the Pacific ship from the Philippines on May 10. As for the selection of players, the Management Committee will be responsible for handling it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Management Committee held a meeting to discuss the selection of representatives and internally selected fifteen players, including Tam Kwun-kan (South China Chinese), Li Tiansheng (South China South), Shi Han (Middlesex), Fizz Walter (Middlesex), Liang Rongzhao (South China South), Lie Li (Navy), Yamba Chen (Artillery Team), Feng Jingxiang (South China South), Li Huitang (Chinese YMCA), Yige Shan'nu (St. Joseph's), Kent Di (Navy), Hou Rongsheng (Kwang Wah), Yi Shi Du Lanchi (Hong Kong Club), Mu Ni (Middlesex), and Li Zhaorong (South China South).</p>
<p>However, this is an internal selection and not a final decision. Their opinions will be sought first to see who can travel and who cannot. Then, another selection meeting will be held. Therefore, although the internal selection is currently as such, whether there will be any changes in the future depends on their responses. (The Old Man of the Stadium)</p>

<p>— Lai Duanfu</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, Eastern, emboldened by their unprecedented victory over South China South, crossed the sea to battle Kowloon Club but were unable to win. I regret this. Examining the reason for their sluggish performance in the first half, it lies in the sudden use of Xu Jingcheng to return to the center forward position, while using Chen Yutian, who hadn't played for a long time, as a forward. If they had continued to fight with their existing formation, victory would have been assured. Instead, because of the draw, they lost another point, and their hopes for second place are now very slim. However, yesterday South China Chinese surprisingly defeated the Navy. This not only benefited South China South but also Eastern. I hope that Eastern can find their future direction and aim for second place for themselves.</p>
<p>The Chinese Combined Team fought the Governor's Cup on the 5th, falling behind three times, tying four times, and finally winning five to four. People say their courage and determination are commendable. I say they were improper in their approach. The Western Combined Team was hastily assembled and is by no means a strong team. The Chinese Combined Team is the elite of South China and Eastern. They should have achieved a complete and decisive victory. However, in this game, they often fell behind. Logically speaking, if this is their strength, how will they defeat strong teams in the future? Seeing this, I cannot help but worry about the future of the Chinese Combined Team.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Chinese Combined Team is not weak. Their abnormal performance was perhaps accidental. I am eager to see the Chinese Combined Team win all six championships at stake. I believe that the future of the Chinese Combined Team should be improved. For the sake of cooperation, in the future, whether selecting players from South China and Eastern or selecting two from one side and one from the other, it is advisable to have teammates play side by side. Do not have one player from Team A mixed between two players from Team B, leading to a lack of coordination. In the game on the 5th, two Eastern players, wanting to protect each other, actually ran straight from the left end to the right end, and then straight from the right end to the left end to help their teammates. This not only disrupted the formation but also caused the two to run too much, resulting in fatigue. This can serve as a lesson for future team selection.</p>
<p>Li Shuo You was sent off on January 1st and banned from competition until December 31st. Gao Lushi Yihua Gen was sent off on February 25th and also banned from competition until December 31st. It seems that the Football Association only knows about December 31st and nothing else. If that's the case, I suddenly have a strange idea: in the next competition, players with a lot of complaints may as well throw punches at the end of December. Wouldn't they have the hope of serving just a few days of "football jail"? Just kidding.</p>
<p>The Navy is about to go to sea for major exercises. This is a great opportunity for South China South and Eastern to defeat a strong opponent. However, the two Chinese teams should not have the thought of "waiting for good luck." They still need to work hard in practice to defeat strong opponents. Because the Navy will eventually return as a team after the exercises. Although it is said that key players such as Dickson, Hannyville, Tuo Ban, and Kent Di are about to be transferred, the Navy has many strong players. Their movements are uncertain. Even if those players leave, it will not be difficult for them to bring in even better players. Therefore, I believe that if the Chinese teams want to improve, they must implement a "self-reliance" strategy.</p>
<p>South China will clash with Eastern this weekend to compete for the special Silver Shield final. Both are Chinese teams. As neutrals, we will be equally happy no matter which team wins. We only hope that the two teams will focus on the game and performance at that time and not have a repeat of what happened on January 1st this year, giving people a bad impression.</p>
<p>If South China B can defeat the Shiwant team this weekend, they can secure the championship. It is said that South China will use Zhang Manrong as the left winger. This is good news. I hope they will win this time and break the deadlock of our B team not winning the league championship for many years.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Venue Becomes a Problem; Shanghai Football Tournament Cannot Be Completed; Yiyuan and Racecourse Stadiums to Cease Operations; Over Forty Games Awaiting Rescheduling <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai News] This year's Western League football tournament has been repeatedly hampered for the past four weeks, with as many as 45 games awaiting rescheduling. The Yiyuan and Racecourse stadiums will cease operations from the 20th of this month (Monday). Only the Jiaozhou Park is available until the end of this month. Therefore, whether it is the league or cup tournament, it is difficult to complete this season. It will likely be stopped midway. According to Mr. Speke, the secretary of the association, they have decided to quickly complete the cup tournament first. Only the finals remain for the Scoto Cup, International Cup, Yu Lin Cup, and Junior Cup. The league matches of each group will also enter the final stage. However, the Group A matches, because they use a round-robin system, are the most difficult to resolve. The Scoto Cup final between the Shanghai Municipal Police and the Western Police team will take place next week. The International Cup final between Portugal and Scotland will be held the week after (i.e., the 18th or 19th). If, unfortunately, there is rain again, the Yu Lin Cup or Junior Cup will also not be completed, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e59">South China Chinese's Only Masterpiece This Season; Defeating the Maritime Overlord; Indirectly Benefiting South China South <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The outcome of football matches is difficult to predict. For example, in the Group A league match between South China Chinese and the Navy held at Jia Hill yesterday afternoon, anyone familiar with the current state of football in Hong Kong knows that the Navy has strong strength and is the most likely team to win the championship. In addition, the team is in a serious situation and is working harder to win the championship, with extraordinary ambition. Their past performances have also often been in good condition. Therefore, spectators made a positive prediction for yesterday's game, believing that the Navy would undoubtedly get these two points and that their top position could not be shaken by South China Chinese, who had already lost their championship appearance. The reporter also believed that South China Chinese had more bad luck than good luck, given the team's recent poor performance, frequent personnel changes, and lack of responsibility. What's more, Li Shuo You was suspended, and Yang Shui Yi disappeared. Alas, the phoenix has broken its wings. Liu Yisheng and Lin Depu were also injured and unable to play temporarily. Although South China has many talented players, there is no need to worry about replacements. However, with key players not present, their strength will be weakened. Experts believe that their situation will only worsen and that there will be no more good performances.</p>
<p>When South China Chinese's lineup was first seen yesterday, it was replaced by five or six players from the B team. The formation was incomplete. Spectators who saw this all believed that they would surely lose. The reporter also thought so, believing that their hope of helping their brother team (South China South) would become a dream. With such personnel, how could they resist the strong Navy? It would not only be difficult to win but also difficult to draw. It would be almost impossible not to lose. Who knew that the result of the competition would be the opposite of what we had predicted? The Navy, which was confident of victory and invincible, performed poorly. In the end, South China Chinese scored a goal and lost 1-0. Their championship position was shaken by this loss. Some say that the Navy had bad luck, with an upset occurring. South China Chinese's defeat of this strong opponent, although it does not benefit them directly, does indirectly benefit their brother team. If South China South wins the championship in the future, the contribution of the younger brother team cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Last season, South China Chinese won the championship, half due to human effort and half due to luck. One reason was that their brother team repeatedly defeated strong opponents, creating their top position. In this season, since the start of the competition until now in May, South China Chinese seems to have been doing nothing right. Therefore, the indirect assistance to their brother team had not been seen before. But yesterday, they made a splash, revived their military might, and defeated the Navy, which was in a high position. This great achievement still shows the attitude of a champion. The value of this victory is not the same as ordinary victories. It greatly helps their brother team and is equivalent to giving them a reassuring pill.</p>
<p>The reasons for the Navy's defeat are threefold: (1) When they first saw South China Chinese using half of their B team players to compete, they had a sense of contempt, believing that it would not be difficult to win the competition. As a result, their players performed poorly. (2) In the first half, the Navy repeatedly attacked without success, achieving nothing. This turned their contempt into anxiety. When they were eager to win in the second half, the more anxious they became, the more chaotic they became, and they were defeated. (3) The three midfielders often went forward to help in the second half, leaving the defense unprotected. South China Chinese took advantage of their empty defense and launched a surprise attack. Their defenders were caught off guard and signed a treaty under the city walls.</p>
<p>South China Chinese did not win because of superior strength, nor did they win because of superior technique. The only factor was the effort of the entire team, fighting to the end, continuing to attack people, and搶抢 for the ball. Therefore, although the Navy gained momentum, their deep incursions were blocked. Even if they shot, they were saved by Tam Kwun-kan. The defense was tight, and no one could enter. In short, South China Chinese's victory was due to courage and diligence. Some say that the performance of South China Chinese's players in this game was brave and resilient, with the style of when they first entered Group A. This is also due to the deployment of many young players.</p>
<p>Now that South China Chinese's wish to benefit their brother team has been fulfilled, it is hoped that the players of South China South will work harder and continue to make efforts to achieve complete success, so as not to let down their brother team's kindness.</p>
<p>Considering the Navy's defeat, bad luck was also a factor. Just look at their attacks in the first half, the momentum of the siege of South China Chinese can be used as proof. At the same time, South China Chinese's right winger Ye Runbo missed opportunities frequently, not only failing to connect with the front line but also dragging down the defense. In the 28th minute of the second half, Yang Genbao shot a fierce ball, and Kotas 士 rushed out of the door. Ye rushed over and could have won with a calm shot. Unexpectedly, the ball flew over the door. The spectators all sighed with regret. Three minutes later, Genbao dribbled the ball male Huai and passed it to Runbo. Runbo 切切中, Dejin rushed forward and headed the ball, creating a miracle. This indirect contribution of Ye is enough to make up for his mistakes.</p>
<p>The most outstanding players for South China Chinese yesterday were Tam Kwun-kan and Chen Dehui. Tam defended in front of the goal, repeatedly defusing dangerous balls. The rest of the players were able to exert all their strength and tenaciously缠绕敌将军, Their功甚伟, It should be encouraged. The Navy's forwards can衝而不擅射, Resulting in常失良机, At the same time, right winger 菲频士Was产伤在足部 in the first half,蹣跚不前, So there was no雁行折冀, In the 18th minute of the second half, although菲频士Switched with肯地, Only奔走不能, Useless, Two minutes before the end of the game, Dragging会曾经有cold射, BothJunkan timelyWith one hand拖出门后, Only负角球, Yiyun fortunately, Here are the球负列后Of both sides,</p>

<p>Since Mr. Chen Shulin, a Master's degree holder, took over as the principal of Kowloon Heung Kong Middle School, he has been determined to reform the school's administration. The faculty members are all well-known figures from home and abroad. In terms of physical education, experts such as Yu Anbin, Deng Jixi, and Chen Dexin have been hired. It is said that the school's physical education facilities will be implemented based on the principles of militarization. Currently, Deng Jixi and others are responsible for planning the initial implementation guidelines, emphasizing the sound organization of student physical education administration, following the Ministry of Education's standards for primary and secondary school physical education curriculum, and implementing compulsory physical education step by step according to the situation, promoting military training. The results of physical examinations and school certifications will be used to determine the amount of exercise for students. Students with poor physical fitness will be divided into groups for special training. The results of physical education problem tests will be used to understand students' needs and the suitability of the venue, as a basis for providing teaching materials and formulating examination standards, with the application of teaching materials as the training center. Female students will be assisted in adding rhythmic activities and extracurricular activities will be implemented as appropriate, promoting medal sports and strict field life. Preparations are now underway to build a complete equipment and playground, including more than a hundred kinds of light and heavy fitness equipment and correction tools, as well as considerable equipment for military physical education and children's games. It is said that in the future, in addition to providing for the school's staff and parents, it will also be open at specified times to guide public sports.</p>

<p>— —Excellence—</p>
<p>(3) Counting off: Counting off is a very important thing in the entire team. In the past, many people adopted the method of forwarding (passing the buck) for counting off. I believe this method of counting off is harmful and not applicable. What is the reason? I will tell everyone three points: A. In close proximity and with a loud voice, there is no need to forward to hear. In the army, this forwarding method of counting off is used at night and with whispered counting to prevent the enemy from knowing. We don't need it. B. Turning back and forth easily hinders the posture and majesty of standing at attention. C. When we count off, we must use all the energy from our dantian to push the sound from the trachea to the throat in order to be loud and resounding. If we make this kind of sound, the top of our head should not be in the normal state but deformed (twisting). On the one hand, it is easy to injure the trachea. On the other hand, the sound produced will not be accurate. Therefore, it is best not to turn your head when counting off.</p>
<p>E. Rhythmic chanting - Regarding the chanting of rhythmic beats, if it can be harmonious with the action, it can originally improve the interest in exercise and increase the efficiency of learning, but improper chanting can also hinder physiology and posture. Therefore, when we exercise, we should pay attention to the following points for chanting in rhythm:</p>
<p>(1) The chanting should be harmonious with the action.</p>
<p>(2) The sound of the chanting should be clear, fast, and strong.</p>
<p>(3) All movements of the torso, head, and neck are not suitable for chanting.</p>
<p>(4) Chanting during rapid exercise is harmful to the lungs and should not be practiced.</p>
<p>(5) Limb exercises should be chanted rhythmically to increase the interest in exercise and help the development of the vocal cords. (3)</p>

<h3 id="e68">Where is Our Criticism? <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>A few days ago, I met a friend who writes theater reviews. I know he works hard in this area, so I said to him, "You have hope of becoming a film critic." He immediately retorted, "No, no, for the sake of livelihood." Indeed, nowadays, no one can avoid struggling for breadcrumbs, but because of this struggle, good things are simply unseen: the criticism field is also like this.</p>
<p>In newspapers or magazines, I rarely find good critical articles. What I see are just the same old "praise" or "cheers": this is not Criticism but Reviewing. Of course, we don't need introductions. That's for passersby. Where is our criticism?</p>
<p>Criticism—literary criticism, film criticism, book review, theater review—is a department of art. Strictly speaking, before Sainte-Beuve, there was no such thing as criticism. Therefore, criticism only emerged in the 19th century. Although its history is short, it has gradually emerged as an independent discipline: therefore, to write a critique, one must have a certain level of expertise. We all understand: good criticism, like good creation, has a positive force. But what counts as good criticism?</p>
<p>Here, based on Murry's theory, I write down the standards for good criticism below:</p>
<p>First, express the effect and characteristics of the thing being criticized.</p>
<p>Second, trace the origins of this effect and these characteristics, and describe their necessary manifestations.</p>
<p>Third, establish the decisive factors of this captivating power (the author's background can be mentioned).</p>
<p>Fourth, examine the form and technique of the work.</p>
<p>Fifth, a more detailed examination of a particular feature.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important point is that the critic should elevate himself. Let us listen to Murry: "The critic should realize that he is an artist. He should pay attention to the responsibilities placed on his art; he should respect the technology of his work. He should not overvalue or be gullible. He should not be unfaithful, whether in praise or blame, especially in modern times, he should not be unfaithful in praise."</p>
<p>Murry's point is extremely thorough. For the sake of livelihood, great critics become cheap, disregard their own art or technique, and make unfaithful praise and blame - which we call "flattery" and "condemnation." Such people are still far from being critics. We need to rebuild criticism.</p>
<p>I also feel that one reason why China does not have good criticism is that there is not enough space given to criticism. Literary supplements rarely open a column for criticism, other supplements have restrictions, and magazines are out of the question now. In this environment, good criticism is naturally difficult to create. Criticism itself is an art, and it requires a certain amount of completeness.</p>
<p>If the above two conditions are met—no cheapness, no restrictions on space—how to achieve the five standards set by Murry? I dare to offer a method: the critic is an artist, then, like an artist, he must have cultivation and foundation. It's not easy to be a critic. Fleury said to Anatole France: "Sir, oratory, pure literature, philosophy, history, everything is here, criticism is not included, it includes everything. Yes, critics take turns as speakers, philosophers, historians." I hope that critics will not neglect their training for the sake of livelihood.</p>
<p>Critics, you are powerful, but don't devalue yourselves or be opportunistic.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Hu Quan's Pro-War Argument <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>——Random Notes on Reading History——</p>
<p>History is often an excellent lesson from reality. The mistakes made by the ancients are clearly shown in history to future generations, so that future generations can avoid repeating the same mistakes. This is like a ship that runs aground and sinks on a reef. This reef should have a sign to warn later ships.</p>
<p>In the Song Dynasty, which suffered from the Jin invasion, Emperors Huizong and Qinzong were taken away; areas north and south of the Yellow River fell one after another. Therefore, Emperor Gaozong of Song briefly crossed to Lin'an and established a small, safe, but incomplete court. At this time, the national crisis had indeed reached its extreme. However, at the time, there were virtuous ministers such as Li Gang and Zhao Ding internally, and famous generals such as Zhang Jun, Zong Ze, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong externally; moreover, there were millions of righteous soldiers and heroes on both sides of the Yellow River who were under the command of Zong Ze and resisting the Jin. At this time, if Emperor Gaozong of Song had only made a determination to resist the war, it would not have been difficult to recover the lost territory—but unfortunately, Gaozong was昏庸 cowardly and weak, and lightly believed the false words of Wang Boyan, Huang Qianshan, Qin Hui, and other pro-peace faction members, and actually accepted humiliating conditions to negotiate peace with the Jin people. As a result, virtuous ministers were expelled, good generals were wronged, and the will of the millions of heroes on both sides of the Yellow River was frustrated, and they scattered and disintegrated.</p>
<p>While Qin Hui was in charge of peace negotiations, Hu Quan, a compiler in the Privy Council, strongly advocated resistance. In his memorial, he was passionate and somber, not only explaining the pros and cons of war and peace, but also boldly suggesting that the pro-peace faction be temporarily beheaded to show his determination never to humiliate and negotiate peace. In his eyes, the culprits of the pro-peace faction were Qin Hui, Sun Jin, and Wang Lun. He wrote in his memorial: "I wish to cut off the heads of the three men and impale them on poles in the Gaojie, then the envoy will stay, and we will blame them for their rudeness, and then ask for a teacher to punish them, so that the spirit of the three armies will double without fighting; otherwise, I would rather go to the East China Sea and die. How can I live in the small court?" After the memorial was presented, Qin Hui suspected that he had a mental illness, otherwise how could he have such bold and arrogant words? Qin Hui demoted him to Guangzhou. Wu Shigu of Yixing had Hu Quan's "Pro-War Argument Memorial" engraved on wood. The Jin people offered a thousand taels of gold to recruit it, which shows that the enemy also worshiped the upright and loyal officials of the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Later, when Emperor Xiaozong of Song ascended the throne, Hu Quan presented a second memorial, which again rejected peace negotiations and requested that troops be sent to resist the war. He analyzed the psychology of the pro-peace faction at the time in great detail. He believed that there were three types of people who advocated peace: one type was "stealing and cowardly," with no spirit of national revival, only knowing how to be greedy for life and afraid of death; the second type was "begging for peace," only knowing how to temporarily seek temporary comfort, not for the long-term plan of the country; the third type was "flattering," following the minister's suggestion that peace should be negotiated, in order to win the minister's favor. The country was ruined by these three types of people! It is strange that Hu Quan presented two memorials, but none of them were adopted. Emperor Gaozong of Song made a mistake in the past, and Emperor Xiaozong made another mistake in the future. As a result, the lost territory could not be recovered, and the Song Dynasty was in jeopardy!</p>
<p>Don't forget the past, the teacher of the future. The lessons of history, everyone should remember and never forget. We hope that everyone now should be Hu Quan who advocates resistance, and completely eliminate all pro-peace concepts of stealing and cowardice, begging for peace, and flattering. Whoever dares to openly advocate peace negotiations should "cut off his head and impale him on a pole in the Gaojie."</p>

<h3 id="e71">Refining Tungsten <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>The world's tungsten producing country is China first. There are many mineral deposits in Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces. The national output accounts for 37 percent of the world's output. It is a major resource of our country. Tungsten is very similar to tin, so it is not easy to distinguish. It was not until 1781 that Scheele could distinguish it as a metal. Two years later, someone separated tungsten, and since then it has been used to make hard alloys. But it has never been used alone. In 1905, tungsten was mixed with paste and extruded from a mold to make the best filament for light bulbs. However, tungsten wire is very brittle, so it is very difficult to manufacture and inconvenient to use. Coolidge, a professor at General Electric of the United States, spent many years of hard work. He invented a method to make tungsten ductile (flexible). At first, general metallurgical experts thought it was impossible, because the usual way to make metal ductile is to heat the metal to above the tough point and then cool it to the normal temperature, so that the purpose can be achieved. However, using this method applied to tungsten can be said to be ineffective. Finally, the only method that can be refined and made tough has been found. This method is to crush the metal grains and beat them into grain strips. Soften them when they are cold, then heat them, not so high that they return to the tough point, and then hammer them very carefully. Reheat and hammer them after cooling, each time at a lower temperature than the previous time. Reheat and cool like this, continue hammering until the ordinary temperature is reached. If the same method is used for other metals, not only will they not become tough, but they will become brittle instead.</p>
<p>There is only this one method, but it must be done step by step according to the steps. When the metal grains are pulled out, the bar becomes tough. If you are a little careless, it will completely fail, and the tungsten will be pulverized at the slightest touch when it is cold.</p>
<p>Only after years of hard work and research can satisfactory results be achieved. The tungsten wire that has been made really has an extraordinary tensile strength: one thousandth of an inch thick can withstand a force of 600,000 pounds per square inch. This kind of tungsten wire is so soft that it can be wound into various patterns without breaking. As the saying goes: Refined steel turns into a soft finger, now it can really be said that refined tungsten turns into</p>
<p>The method of refining tungsten from tungsten ore is relatively simple. That is to extract tungsten trioxide, also known as tungstic acid, from scheelite, and then reduce it with carbon and tungsten trioxide to obtain impure powdered tungsten. This kind of powder is pressed into strips with large hydraulic force. It cannot be melted by heat, because the melting point of tungsten is 3370 degrees. This is higher than any other metal, white gold is only 1755 degrees. It takes a lot of procedures and is very complicated to make filaments from strips.</p>
<p>With tungsten wire, the efficiency of light bulbs has more than doubled, and the light emitted is brighter and whiter than any light used before. The efficiency of the phonograph needle made of tungsten steel has increased more than 50 times compared with the needles used before. Other things, like the target of X-ray tubes and the spark plug of cars, have been improved by using tungsten.</p>
<p>Tungsten has two names in Western languages: Wolfram and Tungsten.</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The Macheng River lay quietly across our path. We finally summoned the courage to wade across the river barefoot.</p>
<p>The river water was icy cold. When we dipped a foot in, the chill went straight through our soles and into our hearts. The water grew deeper, and Lao Kai found it a little hard going, but just then, the comrades started singing "Song of the Volga Boatmen."</p>
<p>"This quiet Macheng River isn't bad."</p>
<p>"The waters of the Volga River are full of the breath of freedom."</p>
<p>"This river doesn't freeze in winter. It can't compare to the Volga River."</p>
<p>"The Songhua River does freeze, doesn't it? One day, it will roar out a voice of protest from under the winter ice, bringing fresh air and freedom."</p>
<p>When we reached the opposite bank, we were indeed a little tired. Comrade Wang, being short, had his shorts wet half way up his thighs. "Juan's roar" blurted out a Sichuan curse, then laughed at himself and started wringing the wet water out of his pants.</p>
<p>"You probably can't find a fellow as short as you on the banks of the Volga River." Someone was teasing Comrade Wang.</p>
<p>The little brother didn't mind at all, but said with a chuckle, "I guess the people on the banks of the Volga River don't have noses as small as ours, do they?"</p>
<p>Everyone laughed. Shouting:</p>
<p>"Long live little brother!"</p>
<p>Ahead was a sandy beach. We had to cross the sand to get to the fields, and then we'd reach the main road into town. When one foot came out, the other would sink in. Fine sand stuck to everyone's feet. Looking back, the winding tracks looked like long ropes newly added to tie up boats.</p>
<p>"Faster!"</p>
<p>"Faster!" If we walked another three miles, we'd reach the important town of northeast Hubei—Macheng County.</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>He must remember this task: alone, using a pistol to threaten a young woman from a good family, forcing her from her home to the secret room he has prepared for her; he has already investigated her thoroughly – her courtyard, her bedroom, her bed, even her whereabouts and where she goes at all times.</p>
<p>He must remember this task: to solve the hunger of thousands of comrades and guns, and at the same time, to determine several percentages of his motherland’s fate.</p>
<p>He is not a thief or a robber; he is just a student who studied the navy, a young man of twenty-one years old. He has neither participated in war, nor walked the edge of the battlefield: this kind of life-risking attempt is still new to him.</p>
<p>He wears a leather hat that tightly secures his jaw, leaving only his eyes and nose exposed outside the edge of the hat; on his feet, he wears a pair of felt boots that extend past his knees, with beautiful leather patterns inlaid on the edges and between each seam of the boots: in his hand, he holds a cane, with a kind of elasticity, which, when pushed forcefully against the wind, can produce a sound similar to that of metal. To unfamiliar eyes, he seems like a noble hunter who enjoys hunting as a hobby – someone who still loves his hunting attire while hunting; this kind of deception, using falsehood to conceal a troubled soul, is also a first for him.</p>
<p>However, he is not afraid; because what he relies on is a uniquely selfless belief. The courage generated by this belief is the most invincible.</p>
<p>Of course, he hopes for his own success. After success, in the snowy fields, between the flowing waters, comrades who have suffered for the motherland for years in the piercingly cold wind, can have one or two full meals – even if it is a thin sorghum porridge; at the same time, the gun barrels of their equally hungry guns can also be loaded with a few more bullets. After success, on both banks of the Songhua River's ice flow, in the middle of the snow-capped peaks rising from Changbai Mountain, there will be one or several glorious battles recorded in the motherland's history. After success, countless people will once again celebrate by setting off firecrackers towards the enemy: escaped birds can fly back, and fly back to their old nests. After success, when he returns, let countless hands of comrades cheer and embrace him, embrace and cheer:</p>
<p>'Defender of the Motherland!' Even</p>
<p>'The success of a hero!'</p>
<p>In the world, even if there are precious miracles, how can they compare to his glory and pride? At that time, his life will have received the greatest reward of life, he can die, die in a burst of laughter, and after death, have nothing to regret.</p>
<p>If he fails, he will calmly walk to the desolate execution ground, look at the people seeing him off with pitying faces in front and behind him, and return a sign of revenge, or words:</p>
<p>'Do not forget me, I die for the living – you are Chinese, you should avenge me!'</p>
<p>Or, towards the vast space, say one more sentence:</p>
<p>'Farewell, Motherland and comrades!'</p>
