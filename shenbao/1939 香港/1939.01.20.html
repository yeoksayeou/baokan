<p>全面抗戰開展以後，一年又六個月之間，我國政府在非常艱險痛苦之中，卒能保持全國一致之擁護，並增高我在國際上之地位者，除能在政冶上善於團結全國堅持抗戰建國大業以外，厥爲能在經濟上善於內順抗戰需要外應國際形勢，愼重制定及堅决執行其正確之政策而已。吾人對於國內金融與經濟事業家之勇於愛國忠於受命，及國際友邦之主持正義同情援助，固不勝其感激之情，而對於我國政府之殫精竭慮，面面照顧，事事負責，用能以大信昭示中外，亦不能不表示敬佩；尤以債信之維持一事，為中外所膺服。反觀日乂當局之內則竭澤而漁，萬民騰怨，外即巧取豪奪，舉世沸反，誠不可同日而語。</p>
<p>自民國二十年九月十八日瀋陽事變以來，尤以僞滿洲國成立以後，日×對華，軍事進攻與經濟侵略，相爲車輔，並駕齊驅，其間武裝走私之破瓖我國稅及軍事刧奪之霸佔我海關，直接破壞中外工商營業，間接更予我償還外債工作以重大困難。此固中外週知之事實也。所幸我國負責當局，力排萬難，不惜犧牲，以維持債信爲首務。尤以最近十數個月以來，沿海旣遭日×海軍封鎖，重要海關亦復先後淪入×軍刧持霸佔之下，而我國債信，卒能屹然不動，徵諸近代各國戰時財政史實，誠可謂爲中國莫大之光榮。然我國之光榮，固爲×人所不能容忍；而關稅鉅欵，更爲日×大慾所在，故東北三省關稅之霸佔，尙嫌不足，而繼　天津，秦皇島，烟台，威海衞，龍口，靑島各地海關之攫取；華北關稅之霸佔尙嫌不足，而進謀華中華南全部海關之攫取；猶恐無所逃遁於天下之唾罵誅伐也，乃又有去年五月對　舉行華北上海關稅會談之發起，而卒有危害我國主權之所謂英日關稅協定之成立。彼時我國負責當局，對此非法協定，曾有嚴正聲明，全　有知之士尤其我金融界，亦曾一致反對。自協定成立以後，日×行爲更趨狂謬，凡我沿海及戰區一切重要海關稅收，悉遭暴力劫持，且其所刼持之稅欵，不依法解交總稅務司，而悉移置於該國所設銀行，企圖充作繼續侵華及發展其在遠東勢力之用。其侵害友邦債權，更不待言，此亦中外所共見之事實也。我政府鑒於事勢演變至此，從國家利益立場，固不能長此容忍而繼續爲之墊欵償還關稅担保之一切債務；從國際信義立場，我各友邦亦必能對我處境與態度表示同情，而不能容許日×長此巧取豪奪，以發展其在遠東之勢力。故於本月十五日發佈通告，重申政府維持債信之决心，嚴斥日×侵略友邦債權之非法行爲，並聲明我國政府迫不得已，實行新定辦法，暫時停止墊欵償還所有以關我担保之債務。</p>
<p>我國財政部此種新辦法頒佈以後，薄海內外，均表注意，雖以我國之義正辭嚴，×方之狂勃不法，而博得各國輿論之同情，及對於日乂之抨責。但日×漢奸，則竟乘機製造謠言，從而煽惑，於是浮言囂塵。而據路透社電傳，謂上海銀行界竟有主張承認去年五月英日簽訂所謂海關稅收存放協定之說。吾人同顧我上海銀界過去表現，對此消息，殊表懷疑。所不能不加說明者，厥爲所謂英日海關稅收存放協定，不僅顯然損害我國主權，早爲中外輿論所一致抨擊，亦且爲日×藉以公開刼奪我國稅收，用以推進其在遠東非發展之烟幕，更宜爲中外正義人士所不容，並與友邦在華債權之安全相背反。如此種片面協定竟可承認，則日×刧奪稅收之非法行爲且可謂爲合法；此點尤當爲賢者所共鑒。無論爲我國家利益或顧全友邦在華債權計，對此非　協定，不問持何藉口，斷難予以承認。而財部十五日通告，亦在明顯指出此點，不僅應爲全國所擁護，亦當爲我各友邦所同情共諒。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，我財部十五日通告所暴暫停墊欵償還關稅担保債務之辦法，言其範圍，則僅限於以關稅爲担保之債務；言其內容，則査關稅担保各該長期債務之本額總數，以法定匯率核算，約等於國幣二十五萬萬元，包括外幣借欵約六萬萬元，庚子賠欵約一萬萬元，國幣借欵約十八萬萬元，在民國廿六年內，按期應償還之數，外幣欵項下約國幣四百萬元，庚子賠欵項下約國幣三百萬元。國幣借欵項下約一千一百萬元，共計每月約爲國幣一千八百萬元，而庚欵項下對英美兩國部份，至民國三十五年卽可償淸，且其每月應償之額將較現在月額遞少。吾人於此可知：（一）財部今茲公佈之新辨法，純爲戰區關稅盡被日×刼持，不得已而始出此，正所以表示我國政府對維持債信之鄭重態度。通告原文中固曾明言：『嗣後對於海關担保各項長期債務，凡在戰前訂借，而尙未清償者，當就戰區各關稅收比例應攤之數，按期撥交中央銀行專欵存儲；惟此項攤存辦法，原係應付目前非常情勢之暫時處置，如戰區各關將已存欠繳之應攤債賠欵，及嗣後稅收應攤之數額，如數照舊解交總稅務司時，政府自當仍卽同時照舊撥付債賠欵基金，以恢復舊狀也』觀乎此文，我國尊重債信與大公無私之態度，尤當爲各友邦所共諒。（二）財部新辦法不僅與我國過去苦心維持債信之榮譽毫無影響，且正所以表示尊重我各友邦之債權，用以促督各該友邦與我密切合作，吾人深望各友邦，尤爲英美法各國，應立卽聯合一致，抗議日×侵害債權之不法行爲，促其尊重第三國在華利益，並以經濟制裁等有効辦法，用爲抗議之後盾。蓋日×獨佔中國之野心一日不遭粉碎，中國海關主權一日不獲獨立完整，則絕無利益均霑可言，此亦爲『九一八』以來之淚血事實，而早爲中外所共睹也。試閱十九日路透社倫敦電，『英工商界一致讚許中國財部之通告，所有中國債券，一律囘漲。』更可見公道自在，不容歪曲也。</p>
<p>最後吾人深盼全國各界凜於『國家興亡匹夫有責』之義，當此抗戰成敗轉捩關頭，尤宜對內對外，提高我中華民族之自尊心與自信心，發揚我中華民族團結一致爭求獨立自由之偉大精神？內以鼓舞將士，外以激勵友邦，集中一切力量，克服最後難關，果能人以此自勉，以此勉人，普天之下，同仇×愾，共禦暴×，則何憂抗戰前途之阻礙哉！</p>

<p>七，對於上級命令和本人迭次講演，應切實研究，努力作到。</p>
<p>八，希望大家臥薪嘗胆，知恥　發，以必死之堅心，爭取國家的獨立和民族的生存！</p>
<p>今天在講演之前，先要報吿一段新聞。就是最近一位新聞記者，從上海回來，他在滬港輪中遇着一位日本朋友——一位大阪朝日新聞的記者，在談話中，這位日本記者談判他對於本國軍隊的感想，他說：『日軍此次作戰，雖佔優勢，但軍隊本質已壞，無法救治，無論上海，南京，蘇州，杭州，日軍官兵，紀律之壞，無以復加，遇見女人，不問老幼，任意××，强×之後，加以慘殺，　到壯丁，更是一律殘殺，種種慘酷行爲，全無人道！到一城鎭，任意劫掠，搶了東西，還要焚燒房子！上行下效，無法約束，這實在是日令一憫最大的隱憂」！這一段事實，由他們日本記者親眼看見，吿訴出來，可見凡×軍所到之處，××刦掠，焚燒殘殺，無所不爲，眞是慘無人道，暗無天日！這樣滅絕人性，形同禽獸的軍隊，××政府已無法節制。他們本想將在華　備役部隊調囘本國，換調一批現役部隊來華，但新部隊來到中國，又恐軍紀變動，而已壞的部隊如調回去，不僅社會秩序必起大亂，而且會掀起政叛變，如「二二六」事件，刺殺總理，包圍皇宮的一　行動，都要發生出來。由此可知××現在已經陷於進退維谷的險境，他們軍隊紀律之　，其政府與人民都已深感恐慌，如我們能持久抗戰，××內部必自趨崩潰！各位聽了個新聞，知道××外强內腐的情形，囘到部隊，就要將這種種情形吿訴一般官兵，和各地民衆，增强他們的自信心，激勵他們的敵愾心，使他們知道×軍不僅××；××之後、還要刺殺；不僅槍刦，搶刦之後，還要焚燒房屋，如此滅絕人性，慘無人道，凡屬中國人，無論軍民，都要將×軍看做豺狼猛默，非　除他們不能保護我們同胞生命財產的安全，非消滅他，不能保障我們國家民族的生存，我們參謀人，最重要的任務，就在於明瞭×情，激勵部下和人民的敵愾心，以堅强軍民的戰鬥意志，發揮軍民的戰鬬　能！尤其在每次下令攻戰之前，對部隊要有精神講話，將×情眞像吿訴一般官　，將我們高級指揮官的精神和决心貫徹到最下一層士兵，務使發生强烈的敵愾心，非殺盡×人不肯罷休！如此，纔能够打敗××！</p>
<p>現在要講×我的戰術。首先要知道×人戰術，究竟有什麽長處？前次我們截獲×人一種文件，其中　說日軍擁有優越的兵器，橫　直突，不必取得聯繫，只要估領一個據點，我軍便不敢反攻。這是他自認擅長的第一個戰術。其次他們以爲我軍的優點，第一是軍民氣盛：第二軍隊數量多。因而决定他的戰術。第一在打擊我軍民盛壯的十氣：第二施行各個擊破；第三要泊使我軍處於被動地位，運用他的優越兵器，採取　烈攻勢。處處要先發制人，雖一兵一槍，亦要進攻，務使我軍胆寒氣喪，打消我軍的戰意，×人對我軍情的判斷，和所採取的戰術如此，我們就以此作根據，研究應×的方法，第一，×軍所恃的在優越的兵器，我們就要設法使他作多量的消耗，而不能發生效力。二，　要打擊我軍民的旺盛士氣，我們就要加緊戰時部隊組織訓練，勵行對民衆的政治宣傳，尤其要整飭戰地與後方衛生，救護，運輸，通訊等勤務工作，維持抗戰軍民強固的士氣，並要發揚我軍民先聲奪　的革命威力，壓倒××狂暴的氣焰。第三，他要對我軍施行各個擊破，使我全軍失却聯繫，我們就要勵行協同動作的戰術，密切聯絡，遂行戰略的全面抗戰，他的戰術，卽一兵一槍，亦要對我攻擊，我們就要設法阻止他，消滅他，要打得他一乓一槍，都不能存留！第四，他要先發制人，陷我于被動地位。我們就要處虜立於主動地位，嚴密監視×人的活動，出其不意，攻其不備，迫進×陣斷行殲滅！我們從這半年多抗戰經過，來觀察×人所用的種　戰術，就其顯著之特徵看起來，可以槪括名之爲「錐形突擊」。他們所用的中央突破的慣技，亦就是結集主力施行一錐形突擊」的戰術、這是他們戰鬬訓練中的傳統敎育。我們旣知道他慣用錐形突擊的戰術，就一定要法打破，打破了這個慣　以後，他　不能制我而要爲我們所制服！各位究研戰術，唯一要訣，就是要找着×人最　長最主要的技倆來研究，設定種種可　情况，擬定種種有效方案，拿來訓練部隊，並要注重實地演習，運用嫻熟，務必挫其所長，攻其所短，以爭取勝利的把握。</p>
<p>我們要打破×軍這個「錐形突擊」的戰術，最適當的方法，就是「側擊」側擊的要件：第一要控制相當數量的預備隊，　置於待機的地位，就在×軍進攻方向和必經道路的適宜地點上，周密配備，當×施行錐形突擊時，我預備隊對×軍的側背，猛力進展，施以側擊，尤其要注意　射，從側　方面，襲擊，人。這種側擊，是制服「錐形突擊」最有效的方法，我們過去的失敗，就是不知道運用這個戰術。各級指揮官，沒有控制　行側擊的預備隊，只知道×人由何處攻進來，就只在何處應戰，他突破一點，我全線都退。如果我們在適當待機的　點控制了相當預備隊，當正面被×錐形突擊時，就利用預備隊乘虛側擊，切斷他前後方的聯絡，斷其接　，動搖他的軍心，他的，形突擊，中央突破的慣技，就無法得逞了！第一錐要止面陣地穩定持久，使側擊部隊有充裕的運動與作戰的時閒。面且正面陣綫堅持愈久，×A的弱點，愈易暴露出來，我們側擊的機會愈多，就愈易收得襲擊的效果！我們要正面陣綫能够穩定持久，就要固守重要支撑　，四面築成　固陣地，並須以雄厚的壓力，作縱深配備，準備充分的彈藥，糧秣爲持久副守之計，即使×軍用迂迴包抄或側擊的戰術來攻擊我軍，我們亦能　　　面抗戰，使×人無法攻入。我們要固守支撐　，又要嚴肅戰鬬紀律，非奉命令，雖餘一兵一槍，亦要堅守不退，這就全靠我們官長能激勵部屬的敵愾心，使各個官長都有非吞滅×人不止的决心。我們正面陣地能堅守不動，然後　能够發　側　的效能，打破×人「錐形突擊」的戰術！</p>
<p>我們要打破×軍「錐形突擊」的戰術，還有一點，要特別注意，就是選擇陣地和　置陣地應以兵力爲標準。就是要依照我軍實在的兵力來佈置陣地，不要依地形來配備兵力，以免兵力使用，爲地形所限。這幾句話，希望大家要牢牢記住，切實作到！我們過去所築　防工事，宣是依地形構築陣地　支兵力，以致正面廣　，兵力分散，因而處　不易固守。今後一定要按照兵力多寡決定陣地正面的廣狹。換句話説，就是有多少兵力守多少陣地，兵力支配不到的地方，寧肯暫時放棄；而應守御的陣地，就要抵死固守，不許隨便退退出，至於兵力的配備，還有一個原則，大家應該注意，就是凡决定要守的正面或支撑點，不厭其小，一定要以相當少數的堅强兵力，配以充分的武器彈藥和糧秣，堅築各種正面側面陣地，面面固守，而將我軍的主力控置于側面待機地位，專司側背攻擊，等到×軍經過我側面陣地的時候，突出猛擊，或待×人強攻我正面陣地時，全軍出擊。總之，打破×軍「錐形突擊」的唯一要訣，就是要正面強固堅守，側面猛烈攻擊，一切兵力配備，陣地選擇，工事構築，</p>

<p>【本報特訊】重慶財部十五日通吿，重申政府維持債信之决心嚴斥××侵害友邦債權之不法行爲，並聲明暫停墊付戰區各關應離債款之正當處置。義正辭嚴，引起海內外的注意。各國輿論一致攻擊××，對我毫無閒言，唯一部份人，竟有主張承認去年五月二日海關稅收存放協定，以取得戰區各關，應攤還賠各欵的表示，記者向特有關係方面探得××劫奪關稅的經過如下</p>
<p>海關稅收，向分金單位與國幣兩　，每月均由各關稅務司解匯中央銀行總稅務司賬戶，再由總務稅司委托匯豐銀行代匯到期外債欵，××强奪稅牧始自一九三二年東北各關被×偽武力接收，約佔全國稅收百份之二十，內外債信在我政府努力維持之下，並未受其影響。當時××雖揚言必須有關係各國，承認僞滿，外債賠欵担保部分。方能撥付，各國均置之不理。嗣後德意雖助桀爲虐，承認傀儡政權，竟未曾分得餘瀝，××掩耳盜鈴，欺詐背信，早爲中外所共見。抗戰以來，天津海關首當其衝，前年九月起稅收卽入于正金銀行掌握，嗣後秦皇島，煙台，威海衛，龍口，靑島各關相繼爲×所提取，其中以津海關應撥債賠各欵比數（Quota，此項比數往往歷年不變，約等於各關稅收在全國　數內所佔的百分比，而不盡相同）爲最大，計二三％，一九三七年九月後，津海關僅解來國幣廿萬元，其他華北海關則分文未匯。上海海關應攤債賠各欵之比率爲四三％，從前年十一月起，卽不斷受××摟奪的恫嚇，去年五月三日，英日閒關于華北上海各關關稅存放協定公佈，稅收卽日移存正金銀行，仍用稅務司名義，指定撥充外債及賠款担保基金，當時我政府發言人以該協定損我主權，堅决反對，江海關華員激于義憤罷工反抗，並成　護關組織，擁護政府，××意尙未　，復要求英日協定，應從前年戰事爆發起生効，即江海關積存匯豐二千五百萬元之欵，應歸正金保存，我政府嚴令總稅務司堅决拒絕，×計不得逞，迫廈門漢口廣州各關相繼被攫，××所據各戰區海關稅收約佔全國百份之八十四，我政府去年僅獲得戰區稅收之極小部分，即江海關于六月間一度在其全部八千餘萬元稅收中，解欵一百八十餘萬元，仍苦心維持內外債信，計代墊戰區各海關應　未解之額達一萬萬七千五百萬元之鉅，是所謂英日協定政府因未承認，××亦極力破壞，視爲公然攫取稅收的烟幕，若欲政府改變去年五月以來堅决反對之立場，是抹煞過去東北海關之教訓；而成現實主義之應聲蟲，且爲××所竊笑。</p>
<p>按×最近企圖、爲華北東北化，華中華北化，其于海關亦然。它不但不受英日協定的限制，且可能再來一套無恥的把戲，竟謂海關稅收，屬于所豢養的僞組織，各國必須承認漢奸政權，債欵方能照付，届時，又將如何獲得解决的新辦法？總而言之，政府十五日通吿宗旨，在于指出×方使害友邦債權人和益之事實及其貴任，如　責于政府之不肯承認英日協定，是固例果爲因也。</p>
<p>此事最正當之處置。應由英美法各國，聯合對日抗議，斥其侵害友邦債權之不法行爲，促其尊重第三國在華之利益，並以有効之經濟制裁爲抗議之後盾，援助中國，保持其海關主權之獨立與完整，方談得到利益均霑也。過去上海稅收，原有由國際銀團或第三國銀行保管之議，最近稅欵不存正金銀行之說，甚囂塵上，各友邦目前實不容坐視××囊括政策之持續，而甘受其愚弄也。</p>
<p>最後，中國萬一承認英日協定，不啻在法律上承認××劫奪稅收之行爲，自九一八以來，中國政府習各友邦卽堅持不承認，破壞中國主權之種種侵略事實的態度，此一點萬無商量之餘地，當更爲各友邦所同情所共諒！</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　白云</p>
<p>（二續）</p>
<p>五　西北的重要性</p>
<p>過去我們保衛上海，保衛徐州，保衛武漢等處，在戰略上的目的。都可以說爲的是爭取時間，曾預料到在必要的時候，要自動放棄的。然而在現時的情况之下，我們對於保衛西北或西南，便不能存着這種觀念。我們應運過用去十六个月中抗戰的一切經驗，保衛這國家民埃生命所依的最後堡壘與收復失地的根據地——西北和西南，不使冉有所失。假使我們認爲在西北上將來還有其些地方於必要時，爲了戰略關係而自動放棄，那麽我們在爭取時間上，就要盡最大的努力，爭取的時間愈長愈好，所以今後保衛西北的任務，將比過去保衞任何一重要地方爲艱鉅，在我們的頭腦中，最好不存預料到西北還要淪陷的觀念。</p>
<p>西北不僅關係我們的國防路綫，而且是西南國防根據地的屛障，是收復華北失地的根據堆，是山西這個保衛華北堡壘的後方，絕對不能再使之有絲毫動搖。</p>
<p>就交通，經濟，政治，文化和軍事各方面言，關中特別是西安，乃整個西北的中心，也可以說是西北的心臟，所以要保衞西北，首先要重視關中，特別是西安。西北上的漢回兩民族，必須精誠無間的共負保衛西北，特別是關中和西安的責任。</p>
<p>有人認爲陜西是西北的『前衞』，這話頗有語病；假使如此，我們保衞西北的前綫，就預定在陜西，這樣不僅陝西不能守，即西北也不能保了。西北的外圍是救西綏南山西豫西和鄂西北，要保衛西北，必須鞏固陜西，特別是關中；要鞏固陜西特別是關中，我們必須在軍事上政治上以全力鞏固這個外綫，必須在這個外綫上作不斷的攻勢防禦，這是保衛西北的基本條件，要你護黄河綫，應過河去打，不能只過河來守。</p>
<p>在這　外綫上，我們早有所備。最近我們更有進一步的部署，這正是保　西北的髙明戰略，特別是在山西，我們不惟不許軍隊退過河西或河南，而且睡次增加兵力，只就山　言，我們的兵力，已不下數十萬，游擊戰之發展，極爲普遍。晉西北，晋東北，晋東南和晉南中條山一帶，都已建立下極堅固的游擊戰根據地，晉西呂梁山脈，和汾河流域我軍，也有若干根據地。×人僅在同蒲路和正太路沿綫保持了若干據點，且時時受我襲學，不能安寗，疲於奔命，一年多以來×人不敢渡河犯陜犯豫，這是一个最重要的原因。</p>
<p>×人在山西被我們經常的牽制了他們五六師團兵力，還立脚不穩，何能談到渡河？過去和目前，他們根本上就沒有這種企圖。×人在山西過去和目前，僅僅有啪種企圖：第一，進攻沿黄河的各岸，欲封鎖各渡口，斷我河東西的聯絡，阻我向山西增兵和運輸彈樂等等，以陷我河東軍隊於困境而便於消滅。這一企圖始終沒有順利的實現：風陵渡，大慶關，吳王渡，東禹門口諸波口，雖因永濟河津臨津榮河諸縣失陷而被封鎖，但在晋南垣曲，平陸，晉西軍渡吿處，×一再受我打擊，封鎖渡口的目的，迄朱能達到，我們前後方的聯絡，始終未斷，最近×攻吉縣和柳林一帶的目的，也不過如此，並非有渡河進犯陜北的企圖。一般人一聽見黄河岸上的砲聲，或×人進攻黄河綫某一渡口，便認爲×人要渡河了，這實在幼稚的可笑。第二，×人爲防我游擊隊之發展，爲保護其鐵路或重要公路的交通綫，時時想分區進攻我們游擊隊的根據地，如過去之進攻五台，長治，中條山，汾河流域等處，都不外是這種企圖，但結果大部份都失敗了，而且受過很大的打擊，×人在這種情形之下，還敢輕言渡河嗎？况且在目前全部戰局沉寂之中，×人在山西並未增兵，還有些調赴東北，只是那些少數部隊東抽西調，故示有備，或僅在某些地方以攻爲守的保護其據點，那敢冒險渡河？西北較寒，也是×人所怕的。所以目前即放他們小股渡河來，他們也是不敢的。</p>
<p>×人過去因爲在山西殺人放火搶刦××，激動了我民衆的抗×情緒，加以我軍日久均習於游擊戰衛，軍民合作日益密切，×人在軍事上吃虧不淺，所以近數月以來×人也大做其所謂民衆運動，以貸欵與停止燒殺等小惠，誘惑我無知民衆，以　低我民衆之憤恨，並破壞我軍民合作。本來×人的殘×行爲極難消除，所施小惠，也不易取得我民衆的信任，不宰我地方自衛隊，份子複雜，紀律不良，擾民之處較×有過之無不及，且民衆負担太重，所謂『合理負担』者，原來極不合理，致無知愚民，竟不免有受×人誘惑者，誠屬可惜，此種情形，亟應改善，以增加西北外綫的抗戰力量。</p>
<p>六、黃河防線的近況</p>
<p>在西北外綫作攻勢的防禦，發展廣大的游擊戰，這是保衞西北的積極方法，加强黄河防務，凖備對渡河之×迎頭痛擊，是這保衛西北的消極方法，單就軍事上言，要完成保衛西北的任務，必須將這兩種方法配合紀來。如此才可以對渡河的×人，實行尾擊與迎擊，使不能順利的渡河。</p>
<p>黄河雖非絕對的天險，然而也自有其在防禦戰略上的價値，假使沒有黄河爲界，我們想像陜西自山西失守以後還能有今日這樣安定嗎？有人說：黄河能抵數十萬大兵，自非過言。</p>
<p>黄河自山西河曲聯以下，水流湍急，且流沙過多，河床一日數變，水流中時起沙離，×偷渡極不容易，假使×人要實行渡河，其重兵器在開始絕對不能渡過，必須在步兵渡河佔領相當據點，戰敗我河防部隊以後，才能渡過重兵器，當雙方都以步兵爲主力時，×人便不敵我們，當×步兵渡河時，立刻就與我河防部隊要發生肉搏戰，敵在彼岸的砲兵和上空的飛機，也必失去作用，這樣×人的步兵失去保障，其犧牲精神，决非我×，我們很容易消滅×人於中流或初登庫之後。所應注意者，是我河防部隊，應擇要點而作『從深配備』，最忌長蛇式的沿河佈防，一且×人突破一點，則補救不及了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c32">日本間諜活動 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>間諜戰爭，是現代戰爭中最重要的一種戰爭方式，特別是法西斯侵略者，由於它們本身政治上經濟上種種弱點，不能不運用一切機巧方法，彌補其在戰爭中不能取勝於敵的地方。因此，這些國家對子使用間諜，可謂『不惜鉅資，無微不至』。日本間諜與活動的廣泛與劇烈，尤爲舉世驚嘆。反共協定成立以後，他們又和德意等國秘密勾結，其活動目更可注意。</p>
<p>十九日新加坡電『日本問諜近在此間殊爲活動，英政府警探當局十八日大舉搜査日人商店住宅，搜獲軍要秘密文件無數。』這不過是一個隨手拾到的例子。這些間諜不僅發現在新加坡，並且還遍佈於菲律賓以至大家的四週，這是公開的秘密。除了希望英美法各友邦當局對此能作更進一步的警備以外，爲了地方的治安和國際和平，各界人士，亦應提高警惕，尤其是努力救亡事業的份子，和負有國家任務的官員們，在社會關係異常複雜的地方，更應隨時檢視自己的行爲，至少消極的防制爲×探所用。</p>

<h3 id="c34">羅馬尼亞政治形勢 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 髯虬</p>
<p>（一）國際視線為什么集中到羅馬尼亞？</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞是巴爾幹半島的一個王國，面積不過二十九萬五千方公里，全國人口總數不足二千萬，文化相當落後，國內工業也並不發達，可是現在已經變成了研究歐洲國際問題的重要對象，原因可以分幾方面講：第一在物產上，天然蘊藏和農產品非常豐富，主要物產有石油，食糧，木材和牧羣等，石油是現代戰爭的主要軍資，木材和牧羣等是工業國家的重要原料，因此窮兵讀武和缺乏原料的帝國主義者，就把她看成刦掠的對像，不肯放鬆。第二在地方方面，（一）與蘇島的烏克蘭蘇維埃共和國毗鄰，構成法西斯帶進窺聯克蘭的孔道，（二）多腦河就在羅馬尼亞流入黑海，法西斯帶想從多臘河順流直下，而伸展到近東去，（三）占着黑海西部的海岸線。德國在海上與英國爭覇，她的艦隊非要能在黑海進出不可。第三，羅馬尼亞的命運與世界和平不能分離。羅馬尼亞如果淪爲德國的坿庸，希特勒就如虎添翼，戈秣的使略計劃就有了辨法。國際間縱横交錯的矛盾衝突，把羅馬尼亞織成一個交點，這個火藥庫，如果一旦爆發，將會牽動全歐洲，而把戰禍蔓延到全世界去。目前在我們中國和歐洲的西班牙，侵略與抵抗的戰爭在　着肉搏。已被捲入旋過的人們和已經變成戰場的地區，所占全世界人口和面積的比數，証明戰爭不是局部的，二次世界大戰早已開始了</p>
<p>日本在「九一八」起開始侵略，一舉而佔領了我們的東北四省，國際沒有反應，於是意大利出兵併吞了阿比西尼亞，國際還沒有反應，德意從此聯合起來攻打西班牙，日本在東方進一步要獨佔中國，德國在歐洲兼倂奧大利，分割捷克斯拉夫。三個法西斯惡魔互相呼應着接二連三的打家刦舍，如果歐洲的法西斯蒂一旦取得羅馬尼亞通過這個門戶而進入近東，就會與日本會合起來，世界益發不堪收拾。所以羅國的存亡是世界安危所繫的重要關　，現就羅國政治槪况略陳如次；</p>
<p>（二）從戈格內閣到羅王獨裁</p>
<p>戈格是親德派的首領，在執政以前，久居柏林，和希特勒，赫斯，戈林，戈培爾，牛賴德，里賓特羅甫，羅森堡及其他納粹要人過從甚密。他們的目的，想叫戈格囘去，傳達德國的意旨，勸誘卡雜爾投入納粹黨的懷抱。結果由德國特務橄關在希笑勒設計之下，造成了一篇假報吿，說鐵都萊斯古（鄒國的政治家曾任外長）在國外有種種不利於羅王的陰睬活動，交戈格帶囘羅京吿密。當時鐵氏遠正在國內生病，於是就在聖瑪利八個醫生的會診之下送了性命。據羅京又一傳說，是他給一個鐵衛圑暴徒冒充廚夫混入旅館把他藥死的，這篇假報吿眞是一箭雙鵰，不特劇除了希脫勒的眼中釭，而且做了戈格的敲門磚，在去年十二月廿八日羅王下令解散泰塔萊斯科內閣，論功行賞，戈格居然率命組閣、新外長米萊斯科是意羅法學會的主席，從此羅馬尼亞就與蘇聯疏逺，走上了德意路綫，首先就承認意國倂吞阿比西尼亞，並且簽所訂了所謂兩國和好條約</p>
<p>戈格內閣並無羣衆基礎，就在資產階級中間擁護戈格的人們也不很多，戈格上台以後，羅京交易所的羅馬尼亞證券，陸之跌價，銀行家家擠兌。</p>
<p>戈格內政的第一砲，就是排除猶太人，目的在於榨取錢財，同時拉擺一部份意圖排猶自肥的羅馬尼亞人。</p>
<p>第二砲是違法解散國會，從新選舉。爲便於大選舞弊起見，把前內閣時代所成立的地方自治機關和民衆團體一律改組，而易以法西斯份子。</p>
<p>戈格上台以後，首先感到困難的就是因爲英法捷蘇等國不能立刻改變外交方針，羅馬尼亞重整軍備非露蘇捷英法的軍械與經濟不可，因此不得不聲明外交方針不變而處與周旋。</p>
<p>戈格內閣的壽命很短，成立之後，國內政局搖擺不定，財政經濟都沒有辦法。在六星期中表示整個失敗了。尤其因爲英國方面通知卡羅爾在政局未穩定前不必訪英，法國的表示亦是如此。卡羅爾借債無看，吃着斤量感覺應當愼重。於是內閣又突然改組。他想自己獨裁。不願受政黨牽制。因此新閣閣員全由自己挑選。內閣總理是克利斯德。（在卡羅爾出奔期內，任攝政院職務，是法西斯蒂的同情者）而以泰塔萊斯科爲新閣的靈魂。（泰氏是因爲鎭壓白賽賴比亞南區農民暴動有功而顯達起來的，久得　王信任。）</p>
<p>這個內閣的特質是君主軍事獨裁。卡羅爾老實停止原有憲法的施行。在二月二十一日頒布了，欽定憲法，禁止政黨活動，把一切權力集中在軍隊手裏，民族政策仍是一貫的排除異族，外交路綫是把蘇法捷克及巴爾幹各國擱在旁邊向去接近德意。從此形式的立憲政體變成了十足的君主獨裁。</p>
<p>可是這個內閣卡羅爾還未能認爲滿意。到三月卅一日又全體辭職。四月一日重新改組，換上一批唯命是聽的純傀儡，外交部長改由祠孟祖任。柯氏在使德時代就主張疏法親德。卡羅爾想借希特勒的力量去兼倂匈牙利，而以作爲法國借欵祖保的煤油全部借給德國，爲交換條件。柯孟之出任外交實含有此項作用。</p>
<p>今年三月奧大利的亡國慘劇和鐵衛團的陰謀驚醒了卡羅幽的迷夢。他開始覺悟希特勒的目的在於刦掠，幷不能給他什麽帶助。在五月間，希氏陳兵邊境威脅捷克時候，他切實體會到唇亡齒寒的危險，於是一面由內閣總理克利斯德到華沙去與波蘭簽訂協定，一面繼續鎭壓國內的異已勢力，鞏固他的獨裁地位，而向英國求助。英羅關係於是有了新的發展。下面是最値得注意的幾樁事情：</p>
<p>（一）英國授意羅馬尼亞在黑海沿岸康斯當沙港建築海軍根據堆、範圍較該港原來規模六十二倍，可以停泊現代最大的兵艦。（二）英政界，及經濟界要人紛紛往羅國攷察。（三）英國增購羅馬尼亞農產與石油並鉅量投資。（四）特別制定便于英商在羅投資的法律。（五）英國投資發展羅國的軍火製造業。（六）改訂劃賬辨法。（七）英銀行界大量收買羅國股蔡。</p>
<p>最近（十二月二十日）德國海通社傳說羅外長柯孟已向羅王提議辭職。這個親德外長的辭職消息是很値得注意的。</p>
<p>（三）政黨槪况</p>
<p>一，鐵衛團</p>
<p>鐵衞團又自稱『祖國黨』，是戰後產生的一個秘密恐怖團體。當初首領是苛得利奴。他是因爲在一九二三年晤殺吉賽地方（Jassy）禁止學生反猶示威的警察長而出名的。雖然自命爲羅馬尼亞民埃主義者，但是幷非羅馬尼亞的血族，而是一個烏克蘭人。眞名字叫做財靈斯基（Zelfnskl）這個團體的宗旨是法西斯帶主義。反對蘇聯，反對英法，反對與巴爾幹各國聯合，而主張投降德意軸心。該團經費由德國津貼。內部組織一律軍隊化。團員深入政府重要機關，如參謀本部，特務機關和各大企業，都有他們的活動，幷且按期向首領苛得利奴是具報吿。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 王舉政</p>
<p>精神和恒心是懂得健美的要訣，苦盡甘來！克苦耐勞，出一點力，流一點汗，才能獲得眞正的健美，除此之外，幷沒有別的途徑。</p>
<p>我們舉行健美運動，如欲收獲最大的效果，運動時除須聚精會神之外，尙　具有下列各種精神，如缺乏這種精神，運動往任不僅無益，反而有害，</p>
<p>（一）不可敷衍從事，方法要絕對的正確，動作要澈底，對於運動應有深切　認識。</p>
<p>（二）運動時須「置身於其間」</p>
<p>（三）克苦耐勞的精神，依照規定的次數，行至疲乏而後止，我們從事這種運動在開始的時候，未免感覺困苦，但然習之後，反覺舒適，所以，在運動時不可因稍感不適總爾中斷，</p>
<p>（四）不屈不撓，再接再厲的精神，運動要有規律和一律的秩序，</p>
<p>（五）進取和大無畏的精神不可因稍感困難而退縮。</p>
<p>（六）希望不可過奢，運動亦不可操之過急，須「穩紮曆打」希望過奢常常爲『灰心』之母。</p>
<p>在把第二次的運動介紹給各位之前，我要提醒各位的就是「把每次所介紹的運動繼續行約三日或一星期，然後改行下次所介紹的運動。　（未完）</p>

<p>娛樂……巴黎獨行俠</p>
<p>Lone　Wolf　of　Parls</p>
<p>離奇盜　的內容、喜劇諧趣的風　、故事的佈局也相當曲折、但全片很多髙潮、都平凡地過去、叙述一個世界聞名的珠寶盜、本已改過自新、不做盜竊勾當、但在巴黎爲了帮助一個小國家的公主、奪回皇冕上的珍珠、　重施其空空妙手、巧妙竊術、與藕珠的好爵、大關機智、乃在公主的親弟弟將行登基、片刻的時間中、才完成他的任務、那幼君方得登位、</p>
<p>法國西斯里特勒和弗蘭西絲黛蘭、在本片中皆極稱職、</p>

<p>華悅狄斯奈、所監製的鋼筆畫片、是受每一個觀衆的讀　與歡迎的、特別是在他「雪姑七友」大胆嘗試的成功之後、更受一般愛好電影的祝衆們大大的注意、這一場『彩片精華』的放映、都是選擇集合他最近的作品、片共上本、片名列下、</p>
<p>『獵狐記』、『怪鸚鵡』、『家畜交響曲』、『打球笑話』、『水晶宮王子』一銀星童詁』『捕鯨記』『幸運之日』『不　之牛』『巨人記』</p>

<p>平安……羅容宮烈傳</p>
<p>Scilone　Liafrlcano</p>
<p>是一部歷史片描寫古代羅馬一段轟擊烈烈的對外戰爭，片中的佈景興及場面的偉大沒有部影片足與比幷的、宮殿廟宇的壯觀、沙場的血戰、成千　萬的騎步兵的　鋒陷陣、象戰隊的推堅、古戰艦的奇觀、把那時代兩個民族的戰爭、活神活現的表現在銀　上、從電影藝衛的觀點上看來、本片是是一部成功的作品、但是因爲片中深有我們熟識聞名的明星作爲號召、同時又時一部義國的出品、並且是全用西班牙語　日、</p>
<p>東方……白虎魔神</p>
<p>BooLoo</p>
<p>雖不能說是組襲濫造但也不見得怎樣精彩、不過故事的背景與取材，比之普通的野獸片、較爲新穎不同一點、導演格拉雅利岳對於野獸片的攝製頗有經驗、本片處理得還可取</p>

<p>— 希氏</p>
<p>廣州失陷前、港粵間交通原極使利的、今已至爲困阻、加上內地公路中離戰區較近者多已自動破壞、往來行旅、無論在經濟、時間及精神、體力等方面的額外虛耗都感到不勝其繁、筆者本年元旦首　南、自粵西北之連縣起、陽山、淸遠、四會、髙要、新興、開平、　會、中山等縣而過澳抵港、耗時旬又兩日、其間除百餘華里仍獲公路車乘搭外、其餘旅程盡以安步當車、倘不習於跋涉之勞動者、當大嘆其苦也、</p>
<p>連縣、昔爲淸連州府治地、　連江上游、爲小北江貨物集散處、去年上月末旬省府移　後、粵省軍政　要及各界名流雲集其間、他在政治、經濟、文化上之地位突形重要、當廣州失守前後、×機分飛粵省各縣市濫施轟炸實爲「七七」以來最慘　者、待省府及華南各重要機關遷　後不久×機即對其作首次之轟炸、結果、死傷二百餘、新　頹垣、自是昔日街市繁榮、白日裏已成蕭條寂靜的縣城、影響所及、附近未遭轟炸縣　的同胞咸受風鶴之驚，這止好是「事實勝於雄辯」的抗戰宣傳、替我們喚醒了還有許多是仍在醉生夢死乃至那些全然昧於國勢的一般農民們、</p>
<p>從前、廣州連縣間的往還路線多以走廣武鐵路、在連江口站轉乘民船直往爲主、其次、乘輪至淸遠　城、轉搭公路車至縣屬白石潭、再步經陽山縣而達、本來、淸陽公路（由淸遠至陽山）興築於數年前、迄今通車者僅得上述的一程、具未開築路線則佔大半，以連陽一屬（連縣、連　、陽山）山地連綿、僻於西北、文　之與三角洲者比、不啻壤霄、則其有待乎交通及百端待舉　開發正殷、但公路之完成迄仍遙遙無期、　江在未受粵南戰事影響前原爲此小化江所經各縣份貨運行旅習經水道、惟其是北江之支源、終年滾滾　南而　、平均水　不致　脛、湍流險灘至多、順流而　、偶爾不　、舟翩極易、倘溯流而上、非以船夫步行河畔以繩拉船不前、　號叫以寬呼吸急逼之巨　、臨風傳進耳朶、×眺視船夫牽繩俯身拼命爭扎的艱辛動作、可知人力與自然搏鬥、所負代價大而收效徵、小北江交通困閉於此可見、</p>
<p>元旦乘舟順流南下，連縣陽山兩縣縣城相距約百一十華里、益以西北風之助力、五小時即達、自後者南幷淸遠白石潭有兩路可通、一經七拱壚、一經水口墟、分爲西東兩　，惟前者路遠平坦、後者較近　多、倘不習長途步行者、白二—里的崎唱山道、步行確苦、但尙有山兜可乘、轎夫健步如飛、其體力之壯與乎勞動耐　之　、十小時內可達，眞使一般文弱者且驚且愧、以此間農　生活之克苦、動作之驕捷、方今戰事膠着、如能　時施以急進民衆運　、更加强原有自衞團隊的軍事與政治的訓練、一旦敵果北沿鐵路進車、　能　敵人左翼以參烈的襲繫殆無疑義、筆者道經陽山縣城、遍訪友　、詢及縣政、　語頗多、　戰時工作而言、全　等因奉此而作、聊以塞責、聞該縣城最近所貼標語雖云琳琅滿目、美不勝收、而其所以然者實緣第四戰區政治部督導團突然而至所致、此亦爲戰時後方至妙之點綴品也、</p>
<p>乘淸陽公路到達淸遠縣城後沿途所見、已非如上述各　對于後方抗戰準備工作那般的　懈、低限度一般同胞在生活上所表現來　神氣比較緊張、固無論此種表皮的觀察涵着的內容有關抗戰的影響是多是少、而使筆　興奪不少、還算　氣不　、　陽公路從白石潭南下的一段不但公路依然未毀、還有按時的　車行駛、省却了九十餘里的步行勞力、沿線淸遠警備司今部巡査哨施行交通檢査的達九次之多、假如搽客那一位被其談爲可疑的、將不免通　都被嚴査一遍、尙須應付種種的盤査、携有行　、那更頭昏了、然而非常時期裏、消遠縣城又相去三水百多　里、凡是良民怎敢不安守後方的秩序？不過、施行特別撿査能够相當滿意完成任務、必須循着兩個原則進行、（一）精於可疑人物的杳騐、（二）敏捷於一般的檢査、方至不至兩誤、（未完）</p>

<p>— 潘泰封</p>
<p>及其沿綫景物</p>
<p>一、前陳</p>
<p>仕餘年、中國之號稱模範省者、　推晉桂、而廣西之始建設、猶後晉省十餘年、然其成績　突飛猛晉、且過之無不及、即以公路一項而論、枝幹縱横、輪車四達、昔之崎嶇、今爲坦途、昔也沼沼長程、今則朝發夕至、此則於政令之推行、貨物之流轉、以及傅播文化、　設國防、均有莫大之影響、國人震廣西建設進步之速、當知其所以能獲得成功者、公路之功有足多也、</p>
<p>二、沿革</p>
<p>溯　西案路之始、實發軔於民國四年之邕武路、由邕寧　武鳴長四—二公里、由前將軍署派遣陸軍工兵營開始興　、具後因事關係軍事、時有中輟、至民國八年　獲　車、嗣後政局廳定、路政不修、僅　國一年築邕寧至五塘一段、十一年就原有之那南公路、加以舖修而已、迨十三年起、工程進行、始漸活躍、至民國十七年以後，乃趨積極、築路原則、先求其　、　後徐圖改善、故分路分段、同時並舉、然因工程難易不同、路綫長短不一、以各路不能同時完成、路綫亦不相銜接、當時爲急求通車起　、乃分區設　、負管理全區工程行車之實、　全省有寧、柳江、桂林、容　、　南五區、均直隷建廳、民國一九年十一月、因應環境需要、曾將柳桂兩區、改用包　制度、二　年六月、始設省公路局、將各區管理局及包商制概行取銷、全省路政、始歸統一、工程方面、支幹線同時並進、且注意于接連隣省道路、以附國道糸統、如大六線自大塘經宜山河池至六　、爲今西南公路之幹線、亦是時所完成者也、行車方面、先于廿一年一月舉辦郵申、以利運輸、初時僅有　車八輛、翌年七、因營業需要、大事增講、幷改郵車爲長途汽　、對於商車管理、亦　定規程。如養路費車票費均有統一價格、　年以來、積極經　、成績裴然、　各大城市、均有新式車站外、小站停軍　、亦次第增建、幷設修理車廠于邕　、賓陽、柳州等處、而懷集、二門江、淸水江、　河、　江、邕江諸河、河面遼闊、未能架設鐵橋、則就兩岸建築碼頭、以便汽車載渡、車輛方面、迄去年三月止、公私共計已達七五六輛、其中屬公路管理局者二七八　、較七年前激增三十二倍、屬於汽車聯合營業社者二七九輛、屬各縣汽車公司者五十輛、　他公私機關贊私人所有者一四九　、以全省人口數比例計算、則每一萬四千人有汽車一輛、雖不足與美國之每四人有車一輛相較、然在內地各省中、已可執牛耳矣、</p>
<p>二、各線分述</p>
<p>聞嘗　建設與政治經濟文化諸端、每有互相因果之効、建設進步，往往對於推政治文化經濟有莫大之便利、同時、政治修明、亦每利於建設、廣西政治、旣三富三　政策標榜於世、故其民衆、富於組織力、對於公共工程、　不踴躍參加、當各路土方開始之際、必先調查沿　—八歲至四十歲之壯丁、　各段村甲長或相當人員、分任段長、集至段壯　爲若干組、組各五十人、指定一定地段、限日完成、雖工資微薄、（每工　食費一角五分、以每日完成七十三方尺爲一丁、）有時或全盡義務、但逃避，事、絕無僅有、所徵民地、除免糧外、槪不給價、亦少怨言、此非平日訓練有素不爲功、廣西路政之成功、因由來有自也、</p>
<p>三、各線分述</p>
<p>截至現時止、全省公路、合約五千三百餘公里、計屬於省道者三千一百餘公里、（內柳州至六寨三二九公里、現列國道範園，亦倂計在內）、通申者二千九百餘公里、屬於縣道者二千一百餘公里、通車者五白餘公里、今　所述，則爲已通車之二千九百餘公里省道、爲行文便利計、依各綫出發點、分成四個中心、—桂林、柳州、　林、邕寧、先陳三義、爲敷述之張本、</p>
<p>築路目的、固在便利民行、惟社會愈進化、各方之需要、亦漸異其趨、故路線之選擇、要頭視有何特種價値而定、方能盡具効用、　省公路、初以推動政治軍事文化爲目標、後則着重於經濟、以疏通貨源、調劑需要爲歸、故於沿綫都邑之資源物　、亦約略述及、此其一、</p>
<p>建設風景、提倡旅行、藉以招來遊客、能於無形中、增加國民收入、已爲　世經濟學者所公認、據統、歐戰以後、歐陸各國、每年獲自美國遊客者、達美金數千萬元、返觀吿國、則最多之一年、亦僅六百美元、此因前此交通梗塞、道阻難行、致使名山佳水、隱沒無聞於世、誠堪嘆息、八桂風光亦然也、今公路暢通、自應</p>
<p>將各路沿綫名勝、表由出之、俾行旅過此、知所涉跡、一消長途跋涉之勞、遊資所　、亦足爲國民經濟之一助、此　二、</p>
<p>公路工程之良窺、對于車行之安全、速度及耗押、有莫大之影響、故於各殘橋樑路面坡度　道、亦約爲述及、此其三、</p>
<p>甲、以桂爲　心</p>
<p>桂林爲廣西省會、城爲唐李靖所　、瀕灘水西岸、居民十余萬、湘人頗　、繁盛市街、在城東南部、商業頗盛、附近農產品有荸薺、麻、茶、　、　菌、百台、柚、肉柱、柿　、烟桐油，、尤有荸薺爲尤著、昧淸甜、無渣滓、年產　萬二千餘　、工業有織布業四百餘家、年織廿九萬疋、　佳者名六塘布、除自用外、更銷黔北一帶、篾業亦著名、爲數四上餘家、年裂九十餘寫把、多銷外地、遠達平津、此外桂林一花酒、味醇美、名聞遐　、釀者四十餘家、</p>
<p>挂林地勢、位於拔海約二百零八公尺之髙地、據山而立、風景頗佳、山以　秀峯爲最著、蒼翠獨立、孤茁城中、昔顏延之讀書其地、賦特日「未若　秀者、嵯峨郛郭間」、　秀之名、蓋肇於此、漓山俗　象鼻山、爲陽江（即湘水上源）與漓江合流處、山麓有洞、名曰水月、漓水橫貫其中、他如城東之鬥雞山、穿山、月牙山、龍隱岩、七里山、普陀岩、東北之伏波　、堯山、北　虞山，西之隱山　　之雁山、莫不翠壁丹崖、玲瓏挺秀、誠所謂琳琅滿目、美不勝牧、以限於篇、未能一一詳述也、　跡如挂山之　綵岩、　明臣張同敞瞿式　徇節　、大皇城如桂王建都處、伏波山　漢伏波將軍、虞山祀虞舜、鎭南峯藏　大曆平　石刻、尤爲珍貴、</p>

<h3 id="c69">關於戰爭 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 一民</p>
<p>第二次的世界大戰已經漸漸的在地球上的各個角落醞釀，大約六萬萬的人口已處於烽火的籠罩中。在法西斯瘋狂的貪婪的暴動裏，顯然的，甚於一九一四年的混亂局面是不可避免了。</p>
<p>戰爭，這在一般人的腦中是多麽平凡而又神秘的一種東西！</p>
<p>有宿命論傾向的人講戰爭是一種「天理循瓊」的產物，因此，戰爭的發生是必然的，無條件的，不可挽囘的，因爲：「囘天無力」，「在刦者難逃』。</p>
<p>惟心論者『戰爭觀」，却完至不同，他們以爲戰爭的發生是完全偶然的政治的變態，也就是單純的社會意識形態的突轉。</p>
<p>前者把戰爭的必然性誇大，把戰爭神話化，以爲這種「天理」的「循　』是鐵定的，而人類便只有在這循環的階段中受任意播弄，「生殺予奪，任其施之」，因此就在戰爭裏呈現出消極的狀態，荒淫放蕩，享樂苟安，不知道民族國家，更不明白生存　門。</p>
<p>後者沒有深入的看到戰爭的　，醫如中國的抗戰，在他們的眼中看來，就是純由中國人民七七事變時過份激奮所引起的，如果當時少爲緩和，那麽這場大風波就可以平息了。現在，中國的堅持抗戰在他們眼中看來，也是由於一般人的」火氣未消」「發幹下去」，而忽略了「平心靜氣』「互相提携」的「和平」精神。</p>
<p>以上的兩個觀念都是一切誤解了或者曲解了戰爭的眞義。</p>
<p>因爲戰爭不是世事的循環，而是世事的演進。戰爭是在歷史辯證發展的一定階段中社會的形態的變遷。歷史是人造成的，當然，戰爭也只是人爲的：人與人的集團不平等激起了戰爭。同時，經過人與人的努力奮鬭而得達平等時就結束了戰爭。不過，這並不是不變的均衡或動搖狀態；在每個戰爭的破壞之後繼着便有建設，而繼續在一定的太平情况一裏新的不平　生到髙度時又爆發了戰爭。在每個和平日子的紛去　來中人們的文化進步了，同時，在每　戰爭的發生又結束的過程中，人類的社會內容也跟着向前飛躍。</p>
<p>由於戰爭是社會形態的變遷，所以决定戰爭爆發而展開的必然性還是社會的內容與本　。好像一九一四年的世界大戰是由于帝國主義者的分　，這種分賊的原因是被决定於各國內資本主義髙度的發展裏，而實本主義高度的發展就是其社會本質上生產力與生產關係的矛盾所致。更好像今天中國的抗戰，是因爲歷史一實的發展，由封建制度下以日帝國主義的高壓下所展開的爭取解放的鬥爭，中國社會本質使中國站在半殖民帥的地位，同時它的發展亦使中國由半殖民地的位置抬頭向上掙扎另一方面，日本法西斯對中國的侵略。也是因爲他自己國內剝削制度的演進不得不在國外尋求市塲。總之，一切的戰爭都有其本質上的差異，今天，我們的抗戰不是什麽「三十年戰爭』，也不是什麽「百年戰爭』一類的封健時代裏的戰爭。封建時代裏的戰爭是在完成它的任務而完滿解决，我們的爭戰亦必然要在我們民族的的解放的勝利的原則下來解决，而不是把空泛的「和乎」，「提携」「不侵犯』的權念來作解决戰爭的前　。</p>
<p>對於戰爭的一切曲解誤解，我們是堅决反對的，我們要對於那本着不良的　圖而發出的錯誤論調予以有力的反駁，提防它毒素注進了人羣。</p>
<p>現在，戰爭已經廣泛的展開在中國及西班牙，同特，在其他地方也佈滿着濃郁的火藥味，對於戰爭殘酷的擴人，我們一點也沒有驚慌動搖，只有鎭定的用我們正確的觀點去觀祭，更不斷的準備與照付：</p>
<p>對着已經來臨的或展開的戰爭，我們的基本熊度就是以『民族解放』及「人類解放」爲解决戰爭的最高原前，但是，要在妥協與空泛的「和平」中去求戰爭的調劑及解决是不能的，我們應該具備「爲眞正的和平而一戰爭」，「以戰爭消滅戰爭」的偉大精神去爲獨立，自由，幸福的新中國而奮鬥！更爲平等的新時代的來臨而奮鬥！</p>

<p>— 李一燕</p>
<p>大鵬小輪駛進沙魚涌，船上的閘門開了，左邊是海岸，這一邊的人有許多站起來了，用焦急的眼光眺望着。我也站起來，從憲口望出去，望見對面是一片金黃的沙灘。</p>
<p>「到了！到了！」不知那殘個人這樣呌了起來，全船頓時起了騷動，爭着檢拾行李。</p>
<p>離岸幾十丈遠都是淺水，輪船不能再前進了，擺了尾，慢慢移動着，等小艇來駁載搭客。</p>
<p>因爲搭客的騷動，輪船顚簸着。傾側着。</p>
<p>「喂！……」有誰驚叫着，怕船要倒下去沉了。因爲搭客太擠，這愛慮似乎還不過分。尤其是初次搭這輪船的人，都不免要驚心動魄的。</p>
<p>先來的小艇划到船旁了，搭客搶先湧到閘門邊去，希望快點離船，快點上小艇，快點登岸。單身少行李的人當然佔了便宜。我們同行的五人，各人的行李都不多，本有可能快點走；但是我們共同帶着三箱藥品，比誰的行李都　，要搬下小艇去很不容易，只得讓別人先行。</p>
<p>陸陸續續划的小艇有幾隻，較大的可容二十幾人，最小的連船婦（船夫很少）只能容五六個人。船上有幾石人，靠這幾隻小艇輪流駁載，經過的時間是太久了。起先教們打算讓他們都離去了才離去；但是我們還要走五六十里趕到淡水去，看見這樣的情形，不知要等到什麽時候，覺得不能冉等了。看看有了一個空隙，我們趕快把藥品箱拖到閘門邊　船員見是救雜的藥品，也帮助我們把他們攔着，讓我們先把渠品箱傳下小艇去。可是小艇上已經坐滿了人，很難揷足了，黄同志很勉强地跳下去。伏在藥品箱上。我們四個人不能再跳下去，只好等另一隻小艇。</p>
<p>很快的，另一隻小　來了，但是，小得很。艇上原有兩個船婦，餘下的位置，看來不能把我們四個都容下三個人跳下去，船員則我不要再下去：但我愛伴着他們，終於冒險也跳下去，我們的脚剛落到　板，小艇就離開輪船了。</p>
<p>「不要動—不要動—一動就會沉啊！』船頭的艇婦髙聲呼暍着，</p>
<p>我的位置在船頭，還沒有把身子移正，似坐不是坐，似　不是　，是一個最不舒服的姿勢，但是眼看着起伏不定的小艇，正和　波滾浪的海水搏門着，怎麽和　移動一下呢—</p>
<p>小艇進到終點。停擱着了。我第一個站起身來，船頭下還是潮水，不能跳下去；一刹那間，潮水向後撤退了，我就赶快跳下去，隨卽又赶快向前逃走了。回頭一看，潮水又冲到剛才落脚的地方了。第二個蹺下來的是廖君，也是看準了潮水後退了才跳的；但是他跳下之後。移動不敏捷，脚還沒有離開，潮水又冲　來，因此他的一雙鞋都弄濕了。……</p>
<p>謝天謝堆，我們總算平安堆踏上陸地，可以開始我們的工作了，</p>

<p>因爲我們中間還有一位女同志隨行，這消息不一會就傳遍這十家不到的小村，於是，抱着觀實玩意兒的態度，男婦老幼全趕到山坡上來；先是有些覺得女兵奇怪，到後彼此搭上話，越談越近，反而覺得這女兵的可親可敬了。</p>
<p>「日本兵來的時候怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>當我們把這問題提出來時眞想不到那位于先生回答那樣堅决：「幹哪—幹游擊隊—打到老家可不能再逃了！」——經騐的敎訓，時代洪爐的鍛鍊啊。——「現在不好組織麽？」</p>

<p>— 秋楊</p>
<p>「健公兄在吉縣被×機炸死，殊深哀痛—』這幾個字，在昏茫慕色中，跳進了我的眼廉，證明這不是夢，這分明是一件千眞萬確的悲慘事實。我遙望西北的大角，慘淡地有着沉黑的愁雲，悲唱的北風，像帶來了冲人的血腥味，我的心，起初覺到無限的和刀刺了一般的疼痛，終子冲起一股無明的怒火，我不流淚，我不哀悼，我要報復血海的深仇，我要機着死者的血蹟前進！</p>
<p>認識温先生，是却在三年以前的一個秋天裏，那時候，我開始和社會科學接近，看了他編的政治經濟學和一些很好的哲學書，問問他們，才曉得是我們的同鄕，是一位很積極，坐過監房，當過大學敎授的奮鬥靑平，而他一向在北方，竟沒有緣份和他相見，去年春，一個爾雪紛飛的時節在漢口丹鳳街義成東里十六號的樓上，開始和他作第一次的握手，留給我最深刻的印象的，是他有着北方型的髙大身材，有很會辯論，和淹博學問的　情人，他對抗戰，有着絕對勝利的樂觀，而又對抗戰非常積極堅决勇敢的行動，那時候，他剛由　省前綫下來漢口，他想再行囘去，因了某些問題，不能實現回去的計劃。對我們；他說了許多寶貴的經驗，和處世的方法，並且還鼓動我們要尅苦學習，他有着前進的思想，如火的熱情，我對着他，感到他有莊嚴偉大的氣魄　同時又覺得他是極易親近的關心我們的好人。</p>
<p>我還記得：在雨雪葬的一個下午，他送我北行，親到大智鬥的火東站，爲了火車要明晨才開，就在那一晚，邀我到一間咖啡店裏和我送別。他殷勤的諄　了許多好話，並　給我介紹許多文化界的名人，叫我到遙遠的北國之後，找他們帶助，或認識他們。午夜的冷靜的街頭，我們一同由江漢路囘去的時候，他還很厚意地，送給我兩廳餅乾和罐頭，在江漢一路，我看他消失在黑角裏以後，我才回到我的寓所—　宮酒店，我以爲這次相別，是暫時的，抗戰勝利以後，我們總可以再見他，跟他　習，誰曾想到：江漢路的臨別一握，就是永訣了呢。</p>
<p>到了北方以後，爲了交通的阻隔，沒有給他寄信，可是在朋友　的口中，知道他任某部的設計委員。後來又聽到他返廣州去，八月初，我旣重返漢口，同時如道他將來漢，我天天盼着他來，一直到了八月十二號。（我就凖備在晚上六點鐘搽寧到衡陽去）那天上午恰是暴×大炸武漢的時候，我是在法租界避難，而不凑巧，他就在這緊張的時候來找我，據婆媽說：他知道我怕×機而逃避時，他笑了一下，說是晚上再來，恰好那天我就必須離漢，最後見面的一次，都沒有緣份。現在，我默想他的一笑，大槪是認爲我的怕死吧。或許是笑我還有小孩子的幼稚的狀態吧？我不能猜透他，我現在，只有永遠懷念着他的一笑！</p>
<p>永別了—溫先生！在苦寒的西北角，有着無數萬的中華兒女，已踏着你的血蹟，完成你未竟的救國事業，殺絕×人，報復你的和許許多多殉難同胞的深仇，我們相信：我們下一輩的靑年，不會使你失望！一定能够救起我們的中國，把×人　出中國去！你安靜吧！温先生！一九三九，一，十四日下午七時　下</p>
<h3 id="c73">「數白欖」漫談 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 新丁</p>
<p>爲了文章下鄕問題，大家提過許多寶貴的意見，似乎現在已不是「理論」探討的時候，而應是進到「技術」的研究了。今天看見何華菴的「。章下鄕與民俗文學一，使我聯想起「數白攪」這一種民俗文學的樣式來，覺得有提倡的價値，因此也便便談談。</p>
<p>「數白欖』不知始于何時，但在粵劇中常被使用着。作爲一種有韻律有節拍的「道白」。在緊鑼密嚴中加插了這一套淸脆悅耳的一白」話，對于戲劇的効能是很有帮助的。粵劇在藝衛上的評價姑置不論，然而粵劇爲南方大衆所愛好，「數白攪」尤得普遍的歡迎。却是鐵一般的事實，因此『數白欖』可以晚離了戲劇的羈絆而獨立起來，街頭賣藝者，實零吃的小販　，爲了標奇立異，吸引顧客，往往運用了「數白欖」的方式，用梆子擊看節　，唱出　有趣味的韻文句子，爲他的貨色讀美，結果他的生意往往得到意外的收穫。</p>
<p>這就說明了「數白欖」的價値了。</p>
<p>然而，也許有人懷疑，這種被　夫走卒所喜悅的東西，能否升入「大雅之堂」？如果有這種懷疑的人，他是會忽視了舊瓶可能裝新酒的；其實，問顯祗在我們有沒有「新酒」，有沒有肯做献酒的人而已。筆者以前曾在某鄉做宣傳工作，在一個紀念會一餘興」中，邀當地鄕民嘗試新內容的「數白欖「。博得了烈的掌聲和「再來一價」的要求，最近在本港中華藝協的詩朋誦會和除夕聯歡會席上。羅英先生以時事報吿的新題材作「數白欖」的表演，也獲得了良好的評價。</p>
<p>分析起來，「數白欖」之所以受大衆的歡迎，大槪有下列幾點理由：</p>
<p>一，有節拍有韻律（至少也有押脚韻），動聽。</p>
<p>二，用語通俗，接近大衆生活，易于了解。</p>
<p>三。大都帶有諷刺性和，趣味化。</p>
<p>四，伴隨粵劇而來，內容（已往的）含濃厚的封建意識，投合了「舊頭腦」的口胃。</p>
<p>然而，這裂也許又有人懷疑「數白欖　雖則够通俗了，可是不够嚴肅」、是的，已往「數白欖」在夸劇中的位置，是含有調節觀衆精神疲勞，增加觀衆對劇情的深刻認識底意義，所以寧取輕鬆勿過嚴肅；但我們現在把「數白欖」從粵劇的窩曰脫出來，而且灌輸的「新酒」、是富有民挨抗爭的意識，那末］內容决定形式，新的「數白欖」雖帶輕鬆習性而不妨碍它的嚴肅的。</p>
<p>「數白欖」需要文化人提倡，需要文化人去實行「改　」工作，下鄕工作的同志們，希望你們不要忘記多帶這一瓶新酒去！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Temporary Suspension of Customs Tax Repayment: The Issue of Guaranteed Debt <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the start of the full-scale War of Resistance, for the past year and a half, our government, amidst extreme hardship and suffering, has been able to maintain the unified support of the entire nation and enhance our international standing. This is not only due to its political acumen in uniting the nation to persevere in the great cause of resistance and nation-building, but also because of its economic prowess in aligning with the needs of resistance domestically and responding to the international situation externally, carefully formulating and resolutely executing its correct policies. We are immensely grateful for the patriotic dedication of domestic financial and economic leaders, their loyalty to their mission, and the international allies who uphold justice and offer sympathy and assistance. Furthermore, we cannot help but express our admiration for the Chinese government's meticulous planning and comprehensive responsibility, demonstrating great credibility both at home and abroad, especially in maintaining creditworthiness, which has won universal respect. Conversely, the Japanese authorities are internally draining resources to the point of exhaustion, causing widespread resentment, and externally engaging in deceitful acquisition and forceful seizure, arousing global opposition. The two are simply not comparable.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang in 1931, especially after the establishment of the puppet state of Manchuria, Japan's military aggression and economic invasion against China have advanced in tandem, reinforcing each other. Armed smuggling undermines our tax revenue, and military seizure occupies our customs, directly disrupting the business operations of Chinese and foreign industries and indirectly creating significant difficulties for our efforts to repay foreign debts. This is a well-known fact both domestically and internationally. Fortunately, our responsible authorities have overcome all obstacles and made sacrifices to prioritize the maintenance of creditworthiness. Especially in the last dozen or so months, as the coastline has been blockaded by the Japanese navy, and major customs offices have successively fallen under the control of Japanese military seizure and occupation, our creditworthiness has remained unshaken. Considering the financial history of various countries during wartime in modern times, this can truly be called China's greatest honor. However, our glory is intolerable to the Japanese, and the enormous customs revenue is the object of their insatiable greed. Therefore, the occupation of customs revenue in the three northeastern provinces is not enough; they continue to seize customs offices in Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, Qingdao, and other places. The occupation of customs revenue in North China is not enough; they are scheming to seize all customs offices in Central and South China. Fearing they cannot escape universal condemnation and punishment, they initiated the North China-Shanghai customs talks in May of last year, leading to the establishment of the so-called Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement, which harms our national sovereignty. At that time, our responsible authorities made solemn statements against this illegal agreement, and all knowledgeable individuals, especially in the financial community, unanimously opposed it. Since the establishment of the agreement, Japanese actions have become even more outrageous. All important customs revenues along our coast and in war zones have been forcibly seized. Moreover, the seized tax revenues are not handed over to the Inspectorate General of Customs according to law, but are transferred to banks established by the Japanese, intending to use them to continue their invasion of China and expand their influence in the Far East. Their infringement on the rights of friendly nations is self-evident, and this is also a fact seen by all at home and abroad. In light of the evolution of the situation, our government, from the standpoint of national interest, cannot continue to tolerate this and continue to advance funds for repaying all debts guaranteed by customs revenue. From the standpoint of international credibility, our friendly nations will surely express sympathy for our situation and attitude and will not allow Japan to continue its deceitful acquisition and forceful seizure to expand its influence in the Far East. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, a notice was issued, reiterating the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness, severely condemning Japan's illegal actions of invading the rights of friendly nations, and declaring that the Chinese government is compelled to implement newly established measures, temporarily suspending the advancement of funds for repaying all debts guaranteed by our customs revenue.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of this new measure by the Ministry of Finance, both at home and abroad have paid attention. Our righteous and stern words and the Japanese side's outrageous and illegal actions have won the sympathy of international public opinion and criticism of Japan. However, Japanese and Chinese traitors have taken the opportunity to create rumors and incite unrest, causing confusion and noise. According to Reuters, some in Shanghai's banking community are even advocating for the recognition of the so-called Customs Revenue Deposit Agreement signed by Britain and Japan last May. Considering the past performance of Shanghai's banking community, we express great doubt about this news. What must be clarified is that the so-called Anglo-Japanese Customs Revenue Deposit Agreement not only clearly harms our national sovereignty and has long been unanimously criticized by public opinion at home and abroad, but it is also a smokescreen used by Japan to openly seize our customs revenue to promote its non-development in the Far East. It should be intolerable to righteous people at home and abroad and is contrary to the security of the rights of friendly nations in China. If such a unilateral agreement can be recognized, then Japan's illegal actions of seizing customs revenue can be considered legal. This point should be clearly understood by all wise individuals. Whether for the sake of our national interest or for safeguarding the rights of friendly nations in China, this illegal agreement should not be recognized, regardless of any pretext. The Ministry of Finance's notice on the 15th clearly points this out and should not only be supported by the entire nation but also be sympathized with and understood by our friendly nations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the method of temporarily suspending the advancement of funds for repaying debts guaranteed by customs revenue, as announced in the Ministry of Finance's notice on the 15th, is limited to debts guaranteed by customs revenue in its scope. In terms of its content, the total principal amount of these long-term debts guaranteed by customs revenue, calculated at the legal exchange rate, is approximately 2.5 billion national currency units, including approximately 600 million in foreign currency loans, approximately 100 million in Boxer Indemnity payments, and approximately 1.8 billion in national currency loans. The amount due for repayment in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) is approximately 4 million national currency units under foreign currency items, approximately 3 million national currency units under Boxer Indemnity items, and approximately 11 million national currency units under national currency loan items, totaling approximately 18 million national currency units per month. The portion of the Boxer Indemnity owed to Britain and the United States will be fully repaid by the 35th year of the Republic (1946), and the amount due for monthly repayment will gradually decrease compared to the current monthly amount. From this, we can understand that: (1) The new measures announced by the Ministry of Finance this time are purely a last resort due to the fact that customs revenue in the war zones has been seized by the Japanese, precisely to demonstrate the Chinese government's solemn attitude towards maintaining creditworthiness. The original text of the notice clearly stated: "In the future, for all long-term debts guaranteed by customs revenue that were contracted before the war and have not yet been repaid, the amount that should be apportioned from customs revenue in the war zones will be transferred to a special account in the Central Bank on a regular basis. However, this method of apportionment is a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary circumstances. If the customs offices in the war zones hand over the outstanding debt and indemnity payments that have been apportioned, as well as the amount that should be apportioned from future tax revenue, to the Inspectorate General of Customs as before, the government will naturally simultaneously allocate the debt and indemnity funds as before to restore the previous situation." Judging from this text, our country's attitude of respecting creditworthiness and impartiality should be understood by all friendly nations. (2) The new measures of the Ministry of Finance not only have no impact on our country's past efforts to maintain creditworthiness but precisely demonstrate respect for the rights of our friendly nations in China, to urge these friendly nations to cooperate closely with us. We deeply hope that all friendly nations, especially Britain, the United States, and France, should immediately unite and protest against Japan's illegal actions of infringing on creditor rights, urge it to respect the interests of third countries in China, and use effective measures such as economic sanctions as a backing for their protests. If Japan's ambition to monopolize China is not crushed and China's customs sovereignty does not achieve independence and integrity, there can be no talk of equal opportunity, which is a tragic fact since the "September 18th Incident" and has long been witnessed by all at home and abroad. Reading the Reuters dispatch from London on the 19th, "British business circles unanimously praised the Chinese Ministry of Finance's notice, and all Chinese bonds rebounded," shows that justice prevails and cannot be distorted.</p>
<p>Finally, we deeply hope that all sectors of the country, adhering to the principle that "everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation," especially at this critical juncture in the success or failure of the War of Resistance, should internally and externally enhance the self-esteem and self-confidence of our Chinese nation and promote the great spirit of unity and determination to strive for independence and freedom? Internally, to inspire the soldiers, and externally, to encourage friendly nations, concentrating all forces to overcome the final difficulties. If everyone can encourage themselves and others with this, and the whole world shares the same hatred for the enemy, jointly resisting the brutal enemy, then what worries are there about the obstacles to the future of the War of Resistance!</p>

<p>— Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>1. The most important task of staff officers is to understand the enemy's situation, inspire hatred for the enemy, and maximize the combat effectiveness of our army.</p>
<p>2. The tactics used by the enemy and the methods our army should use to counter them:</p>
<p>1.  Since the enemy relies solely on superior weapons to attack us, our army should find ways to render their superior weapons ineffective.</p>
<p>2.  Since the enemy seeks to defeat us individually, cut off our army's connections, and strike at our army's and people's morale, our army should cooperate closely, maintain close contact, and strengthen morale.</p>
<p>3.  Since the enemy seeks to preemptively strike and put us on the defensive, our army should be proactive everywhere, launching unexpected attacks and striking at their unpreparedness.</p>
<p>3. We should find ways to break the enemy's "wedge-shaped assault" tactic.</p>
<p>4. "Flanking attacks" are the tactic most feared by "wedge-shaped assaults." The key elements are:</p>

<p>Before today's speech, I want to report a piece of news. Recently, a journalist returned from Shanghai. On the ship from Shanghai to Hong Kong, he met a Japanese friend—a journalist from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun. In their conversation, the Japanese journalist talked about his feelings about his own country's army. He said: "Although the Japanese army has the upper hand in this operation, the essence of the army has deteriorated and cannot be saved. Whether in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, or Hangzhou, the discipline of Japanese officers and soldiers is extremely poor. When they see women, regardless of age, they commit rape at will. After rape, they brutally kill them. When they encounter strong men, they kill them all without exception. All kinds of cruel acts are completely inhuman! When they arrive in a town, they loot at will. After stealing things, they burn down houses! The higher-ups follow suit, and there is no way to restrain them. This is truly the biggest hidden concern for the Japanese government!" This piece of information, seen by the Japanese journalist himself, tells us that wherever the Japanese army goes, they rape, loot, burn, and kill, doing everything possible. It is truly inhumane, and the world is plunged into darkness! The Japanese government is unable to control such a dehumanized, beast-like army. They originally wanted to transfer the reserve forces stationed in China back to their own country and replace them with a batch of active-duty troops to China, but they are afraid that the new troops will change their military discipline, and if the deteriorated troops are transferred back, not only will social order be disrupted, but political rebellions will also be triggered, such as the "February 26th Incident," the act of assassinating the prime minister and surrounding the imperial palace. From this, we can see that Japan is now trapped in a dangerous situation where they cannot advance or retreat. The state of their army's discipline has deeply frightened their government and people. If we can persevere in the War of Resistance, Japan will inevitably collapse from within! After listening to this news, knowing the internal corruption of the seemingly strong Japan, when you return to the troops, you must tell all the officers and soldiers and people everywhere, enhance their self-confidence, inspire their hatred of the enemy, and let them know that the Japanese army not only kills, but also rapes after killing; not only robs, but also burns houses after robbing. Being so inhuman and inhumane, all Chinese people, whether military or civilian, must see the Japanese army as jackals and beasts. If we do not eliminate them, we cannot protect the safety of our compatriots' lives and property. If we do not eliminate them, we cannot guarantee the survival of our country and nation. The most important task for our staff is to understand the enemy's situation, inspire hatred of the enemy in our subordinates and the people, strengthen the fighting will of the military and civilians, and maximize the fighting capacity of the military and civilians! Especially before each order to attack, give a moral speech to the troops, telling all the officers and soldiers the truth about the enemy's situation, conveying the spirit and determination of our senior commanders to the lowest level of soldiers, making sure to generate a strong hatred of the enemy, and not willing to stop until all the Japanese are killed! Only in this way can we defeat Japan!</p>
<p>Now I will talk about the tactics to counter the enemy. First of all, we must know what advantages the Japanese have in their tactics. Last time, we intercepted a Japanese document, which stated that the Japanese army possessed superior weapons, making horizontal and straight breakthroughs, without needing to make contact, as long as they occupied a stronghold, our army would not dare to counterattack. This is the first tactic they admit to being good at. Secondly, they believe that our army's advantages are, first, the strong morale of the military and civilians; and second, the large number of troops. Therefore, they determined their tactics. The first is to strike at the vigorous morale of our military and civilians; the second is to carry out piecemeal defeats; and the third is to put our army in a passive position, use their superior weapons, and adopt a fierce offensive. They want to strike first everywhere, even with one soldier and one gun, they must attack, so that our army is frightened and disheartened, and eliminates our army's will to fight. The Japanese's judgment of our army's situation and the tactics they adopt are like this, so we will use this as a basis to study the methods to counter the enemy. First, the Japanese army relies on superior weapons, and we must find ways to make them consume a large amount and not be effective. Second, they want to strike at the exuberant morale of our military and civilians, so we must step up wartime troop organization and training, vigorously promote political propaganda to the masses, and especially rectify the sanitation, rescue, transportation, and communication work in the war zone and rear, maintain the strong morale of the military and civilians in the War of Resistance, and promote the revolutionary power of our military and civilians to seize the upper hand and suppress the Japanese's violent arrogance. Third, they want to carry out piecemeal defeats against our army, causing our entire army to lose contact, so we must vigorously implement coordinated action tactics, maintain close contact, and carry out a strategic all-out War of Resistance. His tactics, even one soldier and one gun, will attack us, so we must find ways to stop him, eliminate him, and strike him so that not one soldier or one gun can survive! Fourth, he wants to preemptively strike and put us in a passive position. We must stand firmly in an active position, closely monitor the Japanese's activities, attack them unexpectedly, attack their unpreparedness, and force the enemy to cut off and annihilate! From the more than half a year of the War of Resistance, observing the various tactics used by the Japanese, from the perspective of their obvious characteristics, we can summarize and call them "wedge-shaped assaults." The conventional technique of central breakthroughs they use is also a tactic of gathering the main force to carry out a wedge-shaped assault. This is the traditional education in their combat training. Since we know that he habitually uses the wedge-shaped assault tactic, we must find a way to break it. After breaking this habit, he will no longer be able to control us and will be controlled by us! The only key to studying tactics for you is to find the longest and most important trick of the Japanese, study it, set up various possible situations, formulate various effective plans, take them to train the troops, and pay attention to field exercises, using them skillfully, and be sure to thwart their strengths and attack their weaknesses to win the certainty of victory.</p>
<p>The most appropriate way for us to break the Japanese army's "wedge-shaped assault" tactic is to use "flanking attacks." The key elements of flanking attacks: First, it is necessary to control a considerable number of reserve troops and place them in a standby position. In a suitable location on the direction of the Japanese army's advance and the necessary road, make careful preparations. When the enemy carries out a wedge-shaped assault, our reserve forces will move forcefully to the enemy's flank and rear, and launch a flanking attack, especially paying attention to shooting, attacking from the side. This kind of flanking attack is the most effective way to subdue the "wedge-shaped assault." Our past failures were because we did not know how to use this tactic. Commanders at all levels did not control reserve forces for flanking attacks, but only knew that the Japanese were attacking from where, so they only responded to the attack there. When he breaks through a point, our entire line retreats. If we control a considerable reserve force in a suitable standby location, when the front is attacked by the Japanese wedge-shaped assault, we will use the reserve force to take advantage of the situation to launch a flanking attack, cut off his front and rear connections, cut off his support, and shake his morale. His wedge-shaped assault and central breakthrough techniques will not be able to succeed! First, the face position must be stable and durable, so that the flanking attack troops have ample time for movement and combat. Moreover, the longer the front line is held, the more easily the weaknesses of the Japanese A are exposed, and the more opportunities we have to flank, the easier it is to achieve the effect of the attack! If we want the face line to be stable and durable, we must hold the important support points, build solid positions on all sides, and prepare sufficient ammunition and rations as a long-term defense plan, even if the Japanese army uses tactics of outflanking or flanking attacks to attack our army, we can also resist the war from all sides, so that the Japanese cannot attack. If we want to hold the support points firmly, we must also have strict combat discipline. Without orders, even one soldier and one gun must hold on and not retreat. This all depends on our officers being able to inspire hatred of the enemy in their subordinates, so that each officer has the determination to not stop until he swallows up the Japanese. If our face position can hold firm, then we can exert the effectiveness of the flanking attack and break the Japanese "wedge-shaped assault" tactic!</p>
<p>There is another point that we must pay special attention to in order to break the Japanese army's "wedge-shaped assault" tactic, which is that the selection of positions and the layout of positions should be based on the number of troops. That is, the position should be arranged according to the actual number of our troops. Do not allocate troops according to the terrain, so as not to limit the use of troops due to the terrain. I hope everyone will firmly remember these few words and do them conscientiously! The defensive works we have built in the past were all built according to the terrain and the number of troops, resulting in a wide face and dispersed troops, so it was difficult to hold firm. In the future, we must determine the width of the face of the position according to the number of troops. In other words, how many troops can defend how much position. It is better to temporarily abandon places where troops cannot be deployed, and the positions that should be defended must be defended to the death and not allowed to be retreated from casually. As for the allocation of troops, there is another principle that everyone should pay attention to, that is, for any face or support point that has been decided to be defended, no matter how small it is, it must be defended by a relatively small number of strong troops, equipped with sufficient weapons, ammunition and rations, and build various face and side positions to defend on all sides, and control the main force of our army in a standby position on the side, specializing in flank and rear attacks. When the Japanese army passes by our side position, launch a surprise attack, or wait for the Japanese to forcefully attack our face position, and the entire army will attack. In short, the only key to breaking the Japanese army's "wedge-shaped assault" is to firmly defend the face and launch a fierce attack on the side, and all troop allocations, position selections, and construction of works.</p>
<p>The tactics mentioned above to resist the Japanese wedge-shaped assault are just a brief explanation. Everyone must go back and study more and practice more so that the entire army up and down can understand the Japanese's conventional techniques and have the ability to break the Japanese army's conventional techniques. If we want to turn defeat into victory in the future, we must start with skillfully using this tactic! (To be continued)</p>

<p>Increased Japanese Warships in Beihai, Residents Evacuate Lianbei</p>
<p>(News from Our Port) Since the Japanese have actively invaded the South, Beihai City, because it is located on the Tokyo Gulf and can advance west into the interior of Nanning, Guangxi, has become a zone where Japanese aircraft appear. In the past two months, Beihai City, Lianzhou City, and other places have been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, injuring civilians and destroying many houses. Fortunately, the local churches and the Hepu Refugee Relief Association have tried their best to accommodate and rescue them, so that innocent refugees will not be displaced. However, the original financial resources are limited and cannot be sustained. Recently, Japanese warships have gathered, and the number of Japanese warships suddenly increased by more than 20 ships on the Beihai sea, with a high probability of landing. The residents of Lianbei urgently need to be evacuated to the interior to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Huang Weiyu, the magistrate of Hepu County and chairman of the Refugee Relief Association, has specially dispatched Committee Member Ma Daqing, together with Reverend Peter Mack of the Beihai Chinese Anglican Church, to Hong Kong to convene fellow villagers in Hong Kong, discuss fundraising to expand relief efforts, and report to the Central Relief Committee, hoping to get assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e21">After the Explanation of Reasons by the Ministry of Finance, Our Foreign Bonds Rebound: The Suspension of Overdrafting for Debt Repayment is Forced; We are Preparing to Consider Solutions <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] After a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Finance made a statement on the suspension of overdrafting foreign debts secured by customs duties, the impression received by financial circles here today was good. Therefore, all Chinese bonds rose in unison. Chinese figures generally believe that although it indicates that China will not be able to continue paying these debts in the future, part of the purpose is to call on people around the world to pay attention to the fact that China has always used its own resources to deal with all debts so far. All parties hope that the spokesperson's statement indicates that the Chinese government is now finding a way to seek a satisfactory solution to this problem.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 19th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance said when receiving reporters yesterday that China is willing to pay all foreign debts and is preparing to consider a fair method to seek a solution, but firstly, the customs duties obtained in the Japanese-occupied areas should be returned to China, and secondly, the action of interfering with Chinese legal currency should be stopped. The spokesperson also confirmed that China has no intention of suspending payment of foreign debts. Although there are no detailed reports on the total revenue of customs duties in the Japanese-occupied areas, according to statistics in 1936, Shanghai accounted for 45.9%, Tianjin 10.9%, Hankou 7.3%, and Guangzhou 3.4%. The declaration issued by the Ministry of Finance on the 15th of this month refers to foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties. Other foreign debts are not included. The total amount of long-term foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties is 2.5 billion yuan. The principal and interest due each month this year is approximately 18 million yuan. The amount due to Britain for the Boxer Indemnity this month is 50,000 pounds, and the amount due to the United States is 160,000 US dollars. The revenue from customs duties in 1938 was 234.57 million yuan, of which about four-fifths was collected from ports controlled by the Japanese. However, the tax revenue of the three northeastern provinces was not included, because all revenue from the three northeastern provinces has been swallowed by the Japanese since the Incident of 1931.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 19th] Last week, the Japanese forced the Shanghai Customs to adopt Japanese for customs declarations. As a result, 70 new Japanese personnel were added to the customs staff. Currently, there are 340 foreigners in the Shanghai Customs, of whom 220 are Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Important Discussions Regarding Relations: The Japanese Plundering of Customs Duties; The Japan-Puppet Customs Agreement Cannot Be Recognized; Japan's Infringement of Creditor Rights Must Be Opposed Urgently <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special News] The Chongqing Ministry of Finance issued a notice on the 15th, reiterating the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness, sternly condemning the illegal acts of the enemy in infringing upon the creditor rights of friendly countries, and declaring the legitimate measure of temporarily suspending the payment of debt from various customs offices in the war zone. The righteousness of the language attracted attention at home and abroad. Public opinion in various countries unanimously attacked the enemy, and there were no idle words against us. Only a few people advocated recognizing the Customs Revenue Deposit Agreement of May 2 last year in order to obtain various indemnities that should be repaid by customs offices in the war zone. The reporter inquired about the enemy's plunder of customs duties from a source with special relations, as follows:</p>
<p>Customs revenue is divided into gold units and national currency. Each month, the customs commissioners of each customs office remit money to the account of the Chief Inspector of Customs at the Central Bank, and then the Chief Inspector of Customs entrusts the HSBC Bank to remit the foreign debt to be repaid when it is due. The enemy's forcible seizure of customs duties began in 1932 when the customs offices in the Northeast were taken over by the enemy's puppet military force, accounting for about 20% of the national tax revenue. Under the efforts of our government to maintain domestic and foreign credit, it was not affected. At that time, although the enemy clamored that it must have the approval of the countries concerned to recognize the puppet Manchukuo and the guarantee part of the foreign debt indemnity before it could be allocated, all countries ignored it. Later, although Germany and Italy helped the evildoers and recognized the puppet regime, they did not get any leftovers. The enemy's covering its ears to steal the bell and deceiving its back, betraying its credit, has long been seen by China and foreign countries. Since the war of resistance, Tianjin Customs has been the first to bear the brunt. Since September of the previous year, the tax revenue has been in the hands of Yokohama Specie Bank. Later, the customs offices of Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, and Qingdao were successively extracted by the enemy. Among them, the quota of Tianjin Customs to allocate various debts and indemnities (this quota often remains unchanged over the years, approximately equal to the percentage of each customs office's tax revenue in the total national amount, but not entirely the same) is the largest, accounting for 23%. After September 1937, Tianjin Customs only remitted 200,000 yuan in national currency, and the other North China customs offices did not remit a penny. The ratio of Shanghai Customs to allocate various debts and indemnities is 43%. Since November of the previous year, it has been constantly threatened by the enemy's looting. On May 3 last year, the British and Japanese agreement on the deposit of customs duties in North China and Shanghai was announced, and the tax revenue was transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank, still in the name of the customs commissioner, designated to be allocated to the foreign debt and indemnity guarantee fund. At that time, our government's spokesperson resolutely opposed the agreement as damaging our sovereignty. The Chinese staff of the Jianghai Customs went on strike out of righteous indignation to resist and formed a customs protection organization to support the government. The enemy's intention was still not satisfied. It requested the British and Japanese agreement to take effect from the outbreak of the war in the previous year, that is, the 25 million yuan accumulated by the Jianghai Customs in HSBC should be preserved by the Yokohama Specie Bank. Our government strictly ordered the Chief Inspector of Customs to resolutely refuse. The enemy's plan did not succeed, and the customs offices of Xiamen, Hankou, and Guangzhou were successively seized. The tax revenue of the customs offices in various war zones occupied by the enemy accounts for about 84% of the country. Our government only obtained a very small portion of the tax revenue from the war zone last year, that is, the Jianghai Customs once remitted more than 1.8 million yuan out of its total tax revenue of more than 80 million yuan in June, and still painstakingly maintained domestic and foreign credit, accounting for the amount that the war zone customs offices should have remitted but did not remit, amounting to 175 million yuan. The so-called British and Japanese agreement, because the government did not recognize it, the enemy also tried its best to sabotage it, regarding it as a smokescreen for openly seizing tax revenue. If the government is to change its firm opposition stance since May last year, it is to erase the lessons of the Northeast customs offices in the past; to become a realist echo; and to be laughed at by the enemy.</p>
<p>According to the enemy's recent attempts, North China is to be turned into the Northeast, and Central China is to be turned into North China. The same is true of its customs. It is not only not restricted by the British and Japanese agreement but may also come up with another shameless trick, claiming that customs revenue belongs to the puppet organizations it raises and that all countries must recognize the traitorous regime before debts can be paid. When that time comes, how will a new solution be obtained? In short, the purpose of the government's notice on the 15th is to point out the fact that the enemy has harmed the interests of friendly countries' creditors and its responsibility. If the responsibility is placed on the government's refusal to recognize the British and Japanese agreement, it is inherently an effect that is a cause.</p>
<p>The most appropriate action in this matter is for the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to jointly protest to Japan, condemning its illegal act of infringing upon the creditor rights of friendly countries, urging it to respect the interests of third countries in China, and using effective economic sanctions as a backing for the protest, assisting China and maintaining the independence and integrity of its customs sovereignty, so that it can talk about equal benefit. In the past, there was a proposal to have Shanghai's tax revenue kept by an international banking consortium or a third-country bank. Recently, the rumor that tax revenue is not deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank has been rife. Friendly countries must not sit idly by and watch the continuation of the enemy's policy of encompassing everything and be deceived by it.</p>
<p>Finally, if China were to recognize the British and Japanese agreement, it would be tantamount to legally recognizing the enemy's act of plundering tax revenue. Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese government and friendly countries have insisted on not recognizing all kinds of aggressive facts that undermine Chinese sovereignty. There is no room for negotiation on this point, and it should be sympathized and understood by all friendly countries!</p>
<h3 id="e23">Northwest Situation and River Defense <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Bai Yun</p>
<p>(Continued from Part Two)</p>
<p>V. The Importance of the Northwest</p>
<p>In the past, our defense of Shanghai, Xuzhou, Wuhan, and other places was strategically aimed at buying time. We anticipated that, if necessary, we would have to voluntarily abandon them. However, under the current circumstances, we cannot harbor such notions about defending the Northwest or Southwest. We should utilize all the experiences gained from the sixteen months of the war of resistance to defend the last stronghold upon which the nation's people and their lives depend, and the base for recovering lost territories—the Northwest and Southwest—to prevent any further losses. If we believe that in the future some areas in the Northwest may need to be voluntarily abandoned for strategic reasons, then we must make the greatest effort to buy as much time as possible. Therefore, the task of defending the Northwest will be more arduous than defending any important place in the past. In our minds, it is best not to entertain the idea that the Northwest might still fall.</p>
<p>The Northwest is not only related to our national defense lines but also serves as a shield for the Southwestern defense base, a base for recovering lost territories in North China, and the rear for Shanxi, a fortress defending North China. It absolutely cannot be allowed to waver in the slightest.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, economy, politics, culture, and military affairs, Guanzhong, especially Xi'an, is the center of the entire Northwest, and it can even be said to be the heart of the Northwest. Therefore, to defend the Northwest, we must first value Guanzhong, especially Xi'an. The Han and Hui ethnic groups in the Northwest must sincerely and without division jointly shoulder the responsibility of defending the Northwest, especially Guanzhong and Xi'an.</p>
<p>Some people believe that Shaanxi is the "vanguard" of the Northwest, but this statement is problematic. If that were the case, our front line for defending the Northwest would be predetermined in Shaanxi. This would mean that not only could Shaanxi not be defended, but the Northwest could not be defended either. The periphery of the Northwest includes western Henan, southern Suiyuan, Shanxi, western Henan, and northwestern Hubei. To defend the Northwest, we must consolidate Shaanxi, especially Guanzhong. To consolidate Shaanxi, especially Guanzhong, we must use all our strength in military and political affairs to consolidate this outer line. We must carry out continuous offensive defense on this outer line. This is the fundamental condition for defending the Northwest. To protect the Yellow River line, we should cross the river to fight, not just cross the river to defend.</p>
<p>On this outer line, we have long been prepared. Recently, we have made further deployments. This is precisely a brilliant strategy for protecting the Northwest. Especially in Shanxi, we not only do not allow the troops to retreat across the Yellow River or to Henan, but we also constantly increase our forces. Just in Shanxi alone, our forces are no less than several hundred thousand. The development of guerrilla warfare is extremely widespread. Extremely solid guerrilla warfare bases have been established in northwestern Shanxi, northeastern Shanxi, southeastern Shanxi, and the Zhongtiao Mountains area of southern Shanxi. Our troops in the Lüliang Mountains in western Shanxi and the Fen River basin also have some bases. The enemy only maintains some strongholds along the Tongpu Railway and the Zhengtai Railway and is constantly subjected to our attacks, unable to rest and constantly on the run. This is the most important reason why the enemy has not dared to cross the river to invade Shaanxi or Henan for more than a year.</p>
<p>The enemy has been regularly contained by us in Shanxi with five or six divisions of troops, and they are still standing unsteadily. How can they talk about crossing the river? In the past and at present, they fundamentally do not have such an attempt. In the past and at present, the enemy only has these two attempts in Shanxi: First, to attack the various banks along the Yellow River, wanting to block the various crossings, cut off our connections between the east and west banks of the river, and prevent us from reinforcing troops and transporting ammunition to Shanxi, etc., in order to trap our troops in eastern Shanxi in a difficult situation and facilitate their annihilation. This attempt has never been successfully realized: Although Fenglingdu, Daqingguan, Wuwangdu, Dongyumenkou, and other crossings were blocked due to the loss of Yongji, Hejin, Linjin, and Ronghe counties, the enemy has repeatedly been attacked by us at Yuqu, Pinglu in southern Shanxi, and the crossings in western Shanxi. The purpose of blocking the crossings has not been achieved to this day. Our communication between the front and rear has never been cut off. Recently, the purpose of the enemy's attack on Jixian and Liulin was also nothing more than this, and they did not have the intention of crossing the river to invade northern Shaanxi. When the general public hears the sound of artillery fire on the Yellow River bank or sees the enemy attacking a certain crossing on the Yellow River line, they think that the enemy is going to cross the river. This is really naively ridiculous. Second, in order to prevent the development of our guerrilla forces and to protect the traffic lines of their railways or important highways, the enemy constantly wants to launch zonal attacks on our guerrilla bases, such as the past attacks on Wutai, Changzhi, Zhongtiao Mountains, and the Fen River basin. None of these are outside of this attempt, but the results have mostly been failures, and they have suffered great blows. Under such circumstances, does the enemy still dare to lightly talk about crossing the river? Moreover, in the midst of the current overall stalemate of the war, the enemy has not increased its troops in Shanxi, and some have even been transferred to the Northeast. It's just that those few troops are being transferred east and west to put on a show of being prepared, or they are only protecting their strongholds in certain places with offense as defense. How dare they risk crossing the river? The Northwest is relatively cold, which is also what the enemy fears. Therefore, even if they let small groups of them cross the river now, they would not dare.</p>
<p>In the past, because the enemy killed, set fire to, robbed, and [text missing], it stirred up the anti-enemy sentiment of our people. In addition, our troops have become accustomed to guerrilla warfare over time, and cooperation between the military and civilians has become increasingly close. The enemy has suffered quite a bit in military terms. Therefore, in recent months, the enemy has also been doing a great deal of what they call mass movement, using small favors such as loans and stopping burning and killing to lure our ignorant people in order to reduce the resentment of our people and undermine our cooperation between the military and civilians. Originally, the enemy's brutal behavior is extremely difficult to eliminate. The small favors they offer are not easy to gain the trust of our people. But our local self-defense forces have complex components, poor discipline, and their harassment of the people is worse than the enemy's, and the burden on the people is too heavy. The so-called "reasonable burden" is actually extremely unreasonable, causing ignorant and foolish people to inevitably be tempted by the enemy, which is truly regrettable. This situation urgently needs to be improved to increase the anti-war strength of the Northwest outer line.</p>
<p>VI. The Current Situation of the Yellow River Defense Line</p>
<p>Carrying out offensive defense on the Northwest outer line and developing extensive guerrilla warfare are positive methods for defending the Northwest. Strengthening the Yellow River defense and preparing to inflict a head-on blow on the enemy crossing the river are passive methods for defending the Northwest. In military terms alone, to complete the task of defending the Northwest, these two methods must be combined. Only in this way can we implement tail attacks and head-on attacks on the enemy crossing the river, preventing them from crossing the river smoothly.</p>
<p>Although the Yellow River is not an absolute natural barrier, it has its own value in defensive strategy. If there were no Yellow River as a boundary, can we imagine that Shaanxi could still be as stable as it is today after Shanxi was lost? Some people say: The Yellow River can withstand hundreds of thousands of soldiers, which is certainly not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>From Hekouzhen in Shanxi downstream, the Yellow River has a rapid current, and there is too much quicksand. The riverbed changes several times a day, and sandbars rise from the water from time to time. It is extremely difficult for the enemy to sneak across. If the enemy wants to cross the river, its heavy weapons absolutely cannot cross at the beginning. It must occupy considerable strongholds after the infantry crosses the river and defeat our river defense forces before heavy weapons can cross. When both sides use infantry as the main force, the enemy will not be able to defeat us. When the enemy infantry crosses the river, it will immediately engage in hand-to-hand combat with our river defense forces. The enemy's artillery on the other side and the planes in the sky will also lose their effectiveness. In this way, the enemy infantry loses its protection, and its spirit of sacrifice is definitely not as good as ours. We can easily annihilate the enemy in the middle of the stream or after they first land. What should be paid attention to is that our river defense forces should choose key points and make "deep deployment." The most taboo thing is to deploy along the river in a snake-like fashion. Once the enemy breaks through a point, it will be too late to remedy it. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e24">League of Nations Council Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss China's Appeal; Stimson and Others Organize Committee to Counter Japan with Economic Power <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 19th] The League of Nations Administrative Council abruptly convened a secret meeting at 4 PM today. It is reported that the member states will discuss China's appeal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th] The Sino-Japanese dispute raised by China's chief representative, Ambassador to France Dr. Wellington Koo, at the Administrative Council on the 17th was discussed at a closed-door meeting yesterday by the Quadripartite Committee (Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China). However, no concrete decision has been made and consultations will continue today. The requests made by Ambassador Koo are unlikely to result in any practical solutions at present. The proposal made by Ambassador Koo to organize an adjustment committee is also unlikely to be adopted by the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] Due to the departure of the French Ambassador to Japan, the French note to Japan was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry today by the embassy counselor. The contents of the note are similar to those recently sent by Britain and the United States, disapproving of unilateral amendments to the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 19th] Americans of social standing have recently organized a committee led by former Secretary of State Stimson, with former U.S. Consul General to Hankou Green as chairman. The purpose of the committee is to prevent the import of scrap iron, oil, iron ore, and freight cars to Japan. The committee will request legal organization at the upcoming session of Congress, and claims to counter countries that violate peace treaties with economic power, as the United States is also a signatory to the treaty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Regarding the need to respect the Nine-Power Treaty, after the U.S. government sent two notes to the Japanese government on December 31 of last year, news has recently been issued from Tokyo stating that the Japanese government will declare in its reply that its basic policy is based on the following three principles: (1) racial equality, (2) all existing economic groups, such as the British Empire group and the Pan-American group, must be abolished to realize free trade, and (3) fair distribution of resources so that all countries can freely obtain them. If Britain and the United States can accept these principles, Japan may hold meetings with those countries. Secretary of State Hull did not express his views when he met with reporters today. U.S. political figures said that the U.S. has never seriously considered holding an international conference on the Far East issue. The U.S. government stated in the two notes that it is prepared to seriously consider all proposals based on justice and rationality, meaning that all international issues should be resolved by all the countries involved through domestic negotiations based on rights and obligations. The proposals to be put forward this time may not be satisfactory, even with the fair distribution of resources. This is Japan's slogan, intending to prove that the country should enjoy priority in Chinese commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e25">U.S. Congress Begins Reviewing Defense Needs; Naval Construction Proposal Immediately Submitted; Japan Angered and Alarmed <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Congress has begun reviewing America's defense needs. The subcommittees of the Senate and House of Representatives have held consultations with military experts regarding President Roosevelt's $552 million national defense plan. Representative May, chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, may invite Secretary of War Woodring and other senior War Department officials to attend the committee's secret meeting for consultation. According to Representative May, the Military Affairs Committee intends to submit a bill as soon as it has heard the recommendations of the government authorities. The Senate Military Affairs Committee has also held meetings, with representatives from the War Department explaining President Roosevelt's plans to strengthen the air force and the defense of the Panama Canal. According to Representative May's prediction, Congress can quickly process the government's proposed emergency budget for increased aircraft. Detailed information on this case has been submitted by the War Department, and the amount of the government's budget can be decided soon. In addition, the group in the Senate that opposes President Roosevelt's defense budget has become increasingly prominent. The leader, Senator Connally from North Carolina, claimed that we advocate a strict isolation policy. Foreign people are now trying to undermine the American government, and American security is under threat. There are "termites" (referring to the activities of national socialists in the United States) stirring in the United States, but the government is only allocating huge sums of money to resist foreign aggression. What good is that? Representative Young from Minnesota gave a broadcast speech yesterday, criticizing that the purpose of the President's defense message is to put the entire country in a state of hysteria.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The Navy's proposal to build more bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has been approved by President Roosevelt and has been submitted to Congress. The contents of the proposal are unknown, but it is believed that the construction of a very large naval base in Guam can be carried out quickly. According to reports, Japan is seriously concerned about the arming of Guam. A Japanese naval spokesman believes that it is an extremely unfriendly act because Guam is close to Japan's mandated islands.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] Regarding the issue of arming Guam, a Japanese naval spokesman said that arming that place is an unfriendly attitude towards Japan, similar to placing a gun at the door of a neighbor. He does not understand the meaning of the U.S. Navy's expansion. From the perspective of experts, submarine and air force bases are established in inland and remote areas only for the purpose of launching long-range attacks on Japan.</p>
<p>Defense Items Probably Difficult to Obtain</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] The Navy's case regarding defense will be submitted to Congress this week. Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, said that, according to his speculation, this plan will include Guam. It is reported that this plan will be directly submitted to Congress and need not be sent to President Roosevelt for review beforehand. A Navy spokesman said that the Navy will continue to push for the defense event to proceed. Admiral Leahy will attend the committees of the议会 to provide the Navy's opinions and urge the议会 to consider military and other reasons, and further explain the amount of expenses. Because the Navy's defense case requires (1) the议会 to pass the budget, (2) there is a designated special fund in finance, some议员 believe that they will request Congress to pass the defense plan, but it is unlikely to obtain special funds for this purpose. At most, only a small amount of funds will be obtained for the renovation of straits and aircraft. The State Department has not yet expressed its position, but it is generally predicted that it opposes the defense of Guam. The议员 said that during the議会 debate, they will ask Hull to explain his attitude. Senator Connally, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from Texas, said that he opposes the defense of Guam or other places outside of Hawaii. He said, "We don't have to try to defend the Philippines. The Filipinos want freedom, let them have it. We should stay out of it and not be involved." Senator Borah said that if the Guam defense case is included on the 议会 agenda, he will lead议员 in opposition. Major General Rivers also expressed opposition to the defense of Guam.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Major General Rivers joined Senator Borah in opposing the construction of a new naval base in Guam. Rivers, who had been stationed in the Philippines for many years, said that Guam is about 4,000 miles away from Hawaii, which is extremely strong in U.S. defense, and its military value in defense is only in its ability to serve as an outstanding part. Under this situation, Guam is too far away, and this outstanding part cannot be defended.</p>
<p>Representatives Request Expansion of the Air Force</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Major General Arnold, commander of the U.S. Army Air Corps, claimed at a closed-door meeting of the House Military Affairs Committee on the 18th that, according to his prediction, the United States can produce an average of 12,000 military aircraft annually in the next three years. Arnold had previously announced at an open meeting that, according to the investigation of military authorities, the current production capacity of American aircraft factories can produce approximately 2,500 aircraft per year, and it can be increased by two or four times in the future. Representative May, chairman of the committee, today submitted a proposal advocating authorizing an increase of 3,680 Army aircraft, so that the number of aircraft in the U.S. Army Air Corps does not exceed 6,000. It is reported that Major General Arnold will announce that the United States should build four air force bases in two years to complete its national defense. One of the bases is in Puerto Rico, one is in Alaska, and two are in the United States mainland. At the same time, the air force base in Hawaii should also be expanded. Arnold also discussed the importance of establishing a large-scale aircraft production capacity in the United States, specifically recommending that the House of Representatives allow aircraft manufacturers to stop manufacturing private aircraft and start manufacturing at least 3,000 military aircraft as quickly as possible to serve as airfields required in President Roosevelt's defense plan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Representative McKeough has recently submitted a bill to the House of Representatives authorizing the Army Air Corps to expand to 6,000 people (originally 2,320 people). In accordance with President Roosevelt's proposal, courses in flight learning will be established in various universities. Representative Arnold said in a speech to the House Military Affairs Committee that he first warned Congress that if we are to realize President Roosevelt's huge defense plan to counter the imagined enemy, we must greatly increase the manufacturing volume of aircraft. Representative Shinter, a populist party Representative from Pennsylvania, yesterday delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, suggesting that 16,000 miles of highways be built across the United States, divided into nine main lines. Three lines run from the eastern border of the United States to the western border, and another six lines run from south to north. Each highway is 100 feet wide, and eight cars can pass at the same time. The cost is 800 million yuan. Some of the artillery used by the troops, such as 16-inch artillery, and searchlights, etc., should be equipped with rubber tires, and most of them should be concentrated in the central regions, so that once something happens, they can be driven to the borders within 12 hours, and transported to the borders with rubber tires within 22 hours to improve the effectiveness of national defense.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The Cabinet held a meeting yesterday, with Prime Minister Chamberlain reporting on the results of his visit to Italy. It is reported that the contents of the report are roughly the same as the statements made by Britain before Chamberlain's visit to Italy. Cabinet members seemed generally satisfied with the overall impact of this trip. Government officials believe that the Anglo-Italian Agreement can be fully implemented. Regarding the Spanish question, it is hopeless to seek the withdrawal of Italian volunteers from the Nationalist forces before they achieve final victory. At the same time, there seems to be deep concern here about any further interference in Spanish affairs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The Executive Committee of the British Labour Party has passed a resolution asking the British government and people to pay attention to the continued violation of the non-intervention agreement by the German and Italian governments to aid Franco, and requesting the immediate reopening of the closed French-Spanish border and the lifting of the ban on supplying arms to Spain.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain recently agreed to the request of Labour Party leader Attlee to write to Attlee explaining the government's attitude toward the Spanish issue. Chamberlain wrote in his letter that the government believes that if the ban on the export of arms to Spain is lifted to supply arms to the Spanish government, the result will inevitably be an expansion of the war, and the impact will be unimaginable. Therefore, the government has no intention of taking this action. Regarding the risk of famine among the people in the areas under the control of the Republican government, the government recently consulted with the governments of the United States and other countries to implement large-scale relief. As a result of the consultation, under the current circumstances, this plan seems unlikely to be realized. In addition, the government has consulted with the governments of various countries to provide relief to Spanish refugees by existing non-governmental organizations. The government intends to continue to handle this matter in this manner. The government is closely monitoring the situation in Spain. If the situation changes and the date of the opening of Congress needs to be changed, the government will naturally suggest reopening Congress on a different date.</p>
<p>Pumla Declaration Guarantees Territory</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] According to sources close to the government, the French cabinet has decided to reject the demands of the left-wing to have France assist the Spanish government forces. The cabinet meeting unanimously endorsed Foreign Minister Pumla's foreign policy, and a declaration will be submitted to the议会 next Thursday, reaffirming the non-intervention policy, guaranteeing the integrity of French territory, and rejecting territorial concessions. However, it also stated that it is willing to negotiate on the Gibraltar railway and port to reach a viable plan. According to reliable sources, the cabinet is prepared to maintain its non-intervention policy at the expense of the cabinet's downfall when a vote of confidence is held on Friday, and to wage war with the left-wing groups led by Bloom.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th] The cabinet held a meeting yesterday, and the focus of the consultation was only one item: Foreign Minister Pumla's draft speech on the international situation.

<p>Spanish Rebels Threaten Barcelona</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The Spanish Ambassador to Britain sent a note to the British Foreign Office, requesting that the note be forwarded to the Non-Intervention Committee, stating that the rebel government purchased four destroyers and two submarines from Italy in 1937. This sale was a blatant violation of the non-intervention agreement by the Italian government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] According to a Spanish news agency, the Spanish government forces have made great progress in attacking the Estremadura front. Government forces have recovered several new positions and threaten the rear of the rebel positions in 密加拉 and 提瓊那拉.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lerida, 19th] The rebels are now increasingly approaching Barcelona. The triangle area occupied by the rebels daily totals 76 square miles. Jutra and Igualada will fall soon. As a result, when the rebels attack Barcelona, there will be no obstacles along the way. Military officials say that the国民军 has broken through the line from 措麻里 to Igualada in many places, so the attack on Barcelona may be difficult to stop.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beijing, 18th] Belgium and the Spanish rebels signed an agreement at the Foreign Ministry here today. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak was attending the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting in Geneva, so Foreign Ministry Secretary Van Langenhass represented the chairman. The rebel side was represented by Zulus, General Franco's representative to Belgium. Therefore, Belgium and the Spanish rebels have officially established diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 18th] Today in Geneva, the question of whether Mr. Burckhardt, the League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, should resign has caused a stir. During a private meeting of the "Danzig Three-Nation Committee," Britain and France advocated for Mr. Burckhardt to remain in his post, while Sweden supported his resignation. The president of the World Jewish Congress, Mr. Goldmann, also strongly urged Mr. Burckhardt to resign, stating that the constitution of Danzig was clearly being violated and that if Mr. Burckhardt continued to serve, the League of Nations would be seen as condoning his past actions. Mr. Goldmann also claimed, "Mr. Burckhardt's orders to expel Jews from Danzig are even more severe than those of the German National Socialists." Furthermore, Poland also strenuously argued that Mr. Burckhardt should not resign.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th Special Dispatch] According to inquiries by this reporter from the League of Nations Secretariat, Dr. Rajchman, the founder and director of the League of Nations Health Organisation, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol are to be dismissed under the guise of budget cuts and elimination of redundant staff. Dr. Rajchman has presided over the League of Nations Health Organisation for seventeen years, and he was the initiator of the League's technical health cooperation with China and its representative in China. Consequently, the Japanese have repeatedly attacked him, denouncing him as a pro-China element. In recent years, Fascists have denounced Dr. Rajchman for advocating a collective security system and democratic politics. Although the dismissal order for Dr. Rajchman has not yet been formally announced, it is understood that he generally plans to leave the League of Nations Secretariat in early February.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Japanese Espionage Activities <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Espionage warfare is one of the most important forms of modern warfare, especially for Fascist aggressors. Due to their inherent political and economic weaknesses, they must employ all kinds of skillful methods to compensate for their inability to defeat the enemy in war. Therefore, these countries are said to spare no expense and be meticulous in their use of spies. The extensiveness and intensity of Japanese espionage and activities are particularly astonishing to the world. Since the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact, they have secretly colluded with Germany, Italy, and other countries, making their activities even more noteworthy.</p>
<p>A Singapore dispatch on the 19th stated, "Japanese espionage has been particularly active here recently. On the 18th, British government detectives conducted a large-scale search of Japanese shops and residences, seizing countless secret military documents." This is just one example picked at random. These spies are not only found in Singapore but are also spread throughout the Philippines and even around everyone. This is an open secret. In addition to hoping that the authorities of friendly nations such as Britain, the United States, and France can take further precautions against this, for the sake of local security and international peace, people from all walks of life should also be vigilant, especially those working to save the nation and officials with national responsibilities. In places with unusually complex social relationships, they should constantly examine their own behavior, at least passively preventing themselves from being used by spies.</p>
<h3 id="e34">The Problem of Civilian Entertainment <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>After art becomes a commodity, it becomes estranged from the majority of toiling people. According to newspaper reports, street theater has been very active in Hong Kong recently. Civilian dramas are often performed in places like Spring Garden Lane in Wan Chai and Guangdong Road in Tai Kok Tsui, attracting general poor men and women. This is a problem worth paying attention to. Those enthusiastic about national salvation and the theatrical movement should quickly launch a campaign to promote proper civilian entertainment and the popularization of theater. Although street dramas and "living newspapers," which have had great success in the North and war zones, may not be entirely suitable for the environment and needs of the working people in Hong Kong, it is indeed urgent to improve the existing civilian entertainment, which contains toxins, and everyone should not let it go lightly.</p>
<h3 id="e35">The Political Situation in Romania <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Long Beard</p>
<p>(I) Why is International Attention Focused on Romania?</p>
<p>Romania is a kingdom in the Balkan Peninsula with an area of only 295,000 square kilometers and a total population of less than 20 million. Its culture is relatively backward, and its domestic industry is not very developed. However, it has now become an important object of study for European international issues. The reasons can be explained in several aspects: First, in terms of resources, its natural reserves and agricultural products are very abundant. The main products are oil, food, timber, and livestock. Oil is the main military resource of modern warfare, and timber and livestock are important raw materials for industrial countries. Therefore, imperialists who are militaristic and lack raw materials regard it as an object of plunder and are unwilling to let go. Second, in terms of location, (1) it borders the Ukrainian Soviet Republic of the Soviet Union, forming a conduit for the Fascist bloc to spy on Ukraine; (2) the Danube River flows into the Black Sea through Romania, and the Fascist bloc wants to go straight down the Danube and extend to the Near East; (3) it occupies the coastline of the western Black Sea. Germany is competing with Britain for naval supremacy, and its fleet must be able to enter and exit the Black Sea. Third, Romania's fate cannot be separated from world peace. If Romania falls into the hands of Germany, Hitler will be even more powerful, and Goebbels' strategic plan will have a solution. The intricate contradictions and conflicts between countries have woven Romania into a focal point. If this powder keg explodes, it will affect the whole of Europe and spread the war to the whole world. Currently, in our China and in Spain in Europe, wars of aggression and resistance are raging. The proportion of the world's population and area occupied by people who have been swept into the vortex and areas that have become battlefields proves that the war is not local, and the Second World War has already begun.</p>
<p>Japan began its aggression with the "September 18th" Incident, occupying our Northeast four provinces in one fell swoop. The international community did not respond. Then Italy sent troops to annex Abyssinia, and the international community still did not respond. Germany and Italy then united to attack Spain, and Japan further sought to monopolize China in the East. Germany annexed Austria and partitioned Czechoslovakia in Europe. The three Fascist demons echoed each other, looting one after another. If the European Fascists were to acquire Romania and enter the Near East through this gateway, they would join forces with Japan, and the world would become even more unmanageable. Therefore, Romania's survival is an important matter related to world security. Now, the general political situation of Romania is briefly described as follows;</p>
<p>(II) From the Goga Cabinet to the Royal Dictatorship</p>
<p>Goga was the leader of the pro-German faction. Before taking office, he lived in Berlin for a long time and had close relations with Hitler, Hess, Göring, Goebbels, Neurath, Ribbentrop, Rosenberg, and other Nazi figures. Their purpose was to get Goga to return, convey Germany's intentions, and persuade Carol to join the Nazi Party. As a result, under Hitler's design, the German secret service created a false report saying that Titulescu (a Romanian politician who had served as foreign minister) had engaged in various activities abroad that were detrimental to the Romanian king, and handed it to Goga to take back to Bucharest to report the secret. At that time, Titulescu was ill in the country, so he was sent to his death under the consultation of eight doctors at Saint Mary's. According to another rumor in Bucharest, he was poisoned by a Iron Guard thug who disguised himself as a chef and sneaked into the hotel. This false report was truly a double-edged sword, not only removing Hitler's eyesore, but also paving the way for Goga to take office. On December 28th of last year, the Romanian king ordered the dissolution of the Tătărescu cabinet. Rewarding merit, Goga was ordered to form a cabinet. The new foreign minister, Milescu, was the chairman of the Romanian-Italian Law Society. From then on, Romania became estranged from the Soviet Union and embarked on a German-Italian route. First, it recognized Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and signed the so-called Treaty of Friendship between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Goga cabinet had no mass base. Even among the bourgeoisie, not many people supported Goga. After Goga came to power, Romanian securities on the Bucharest Stock Exchange fell one after another, and bankers faced bank runs.</p>
<p>Goga's first move in domestic affairs was to exclude Jews, with the aim of extracting money while at the same time wooing a group of Romanians who intended to enrich themselves by expelling Jews.</p>
<p>The second move was to illegally dissolve the parliament and hold new elections. To facilitate election fraud, all local autonomous organizations and people's groups established during the previous cabinet era were reorganized and replaced with Fascist elements.</p>
<p>After Goga came to power, the first difficulty he encountered was that countries such as Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union could not immediately change their foreign policies. Romania's rearmament depended on military equipment and economic support from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Britain, and France, so it had to declare that its foreign policy would remain unchanged and deal with the situation.</p>
<p>The Goga cabinet had a short lifespan. After its establishment, the domestic political situation was unstable, and there was no way to deal with finance and the economy. Within six weeks, it showed complete failure. Especially because Britain notified Carol that he should not visit Britain until the political situation stabilized, and France expressed the same. Carol borrowed money without success, feeling that he should be cautious. So the cabinet was suddenly reorganized again. He wanted to be a dictator himself and did not want to be constrained by political parties. Therefore, all the new cabinet members were selected by himself. The prime minister was Cristea (who served in the Regency Council during Carol's exile and was a sympathizer of the Fascists), while Tătărescu was the soul of the new cabinet. (Tătărescu rose to prominence because of his success in suppressing the peasant riots in the southern region of Basarabia and had long been trusted by the king.)</p>
<p>The characteristics of this cabinet were monarchical military dictatorship. Carol honestly suspended the implementation of the original constitution. On February 21st, he promulgated a constitution granted by the emperor, prohibiting political party activities, and concentrating all power in the hands of the army. The ethnic policy was still consistent in excluding foreign races, and the diplomatic route was to approach Germany and Italy, leaving aside the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and the Balkan countries. From then on, the formal constitutional system became a complete monarchical dictatorship.</p>
<p>But Carol was still not satisfied with this cabinet. On March 31st, the entire cabinet resigned again. On April 1st, it was reorganized again, replacing it with a group of purely obedient puppets. The foreign minister was changed to Comnen. When serving as ambassador to Germany, Comnen advocated distancing himself from France and becoming closer to Germany. Carol wanted to use Hitler's power to annex Hungary and lend all the kerosene, which was the collateral for French loans, to Germany as an exchange condition. Comnen's appointment as foreign minister contained this function.</p>
<p>The tragic demise of Austria and the conspiracy of the Iron Guard in March of this year awakened Carol's dream. He began to realize that Hitler's aim was to plunder and could not give him any assistance. In May, when Hitler threatened Czechoslovakia with troops on the border, he truly realized the danger of shared misfortune. So, on the one hand, Prime Minister Cristea went to Warsaw to sign an agreement with Poland, and on the other hand, he continued to suppress domestic dissenting forces, consolidate his dictatorship, and seek help from Britain. Relations between Britain and Romania then had new developments. Below are some of the most noteworthy things:</p>
<p>(1) Britain instructed Romania to build a naval base on the coast of the Black Sea at the port of Constanța, with an area 62 times larger than the original size of the port, which could accommodate the largest modern warships. (2) Important figures from British political and economic circles went to Romania to investigate one after another. (3) Britain increased its purchases of Romanian agricultural products and oil and made huge investments. (4) Special laws were formulated to facilitate British investment in Romania. (5) Britain invested in the development of Romania's arms manufacturing industry. (6) The method of account settlement was revised. (7) British banking circles bought large amounts of Romanian stocks.</p>
<p>Recently (December 20th), the German Havas news agency reported that Romanian Foreign Minister Comnen had proposed to King Carol that he resign. The news of the resignation of this pro-German foreign minister is worth noting.</p>
<p>(III) General Political Situation</p>
<p>1. The Iron Guard</p>
<p>The Iron Guard, also known as the "Fatherland Party," is a secret terrorist group that emerged after the war. The initial leader was Codreanu. He became famous for killing the police chief who banned student anti-Jewish demonstrations in Jassy in 1923. Although he claimed to be a Romanian nationalist, he was not of Romanian blood but a Ukrainian. His real name is Zelinski. The purpose of this group is Fascism. Oppose the Soviet Union, oppose Britain and France, oppose the union with the Balkan countries, and advocate surrender to the German-Italian axis. The group's funds are subsidized by Germany. The internal organization is completely militarized. Members penetrate important government agencies, such as the General Staff, intelligence agencies, and major enterprises, and they all have their activities, and they report to the leader Codreanu on a regular basis.

<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the selection of players for the Hua Ba United Team in the Li Wah Cup football preliminary round, the selection committee held another meeting yesterday and established a more complete lineup.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the selection committee members accepted this newspaper's suggestion. However, although Hou Chengtou and Song Lingsheng were selected, it is said that their foot injuries have not healed yet, and it is still unknown whether they will be able to play at the time. Therefore, all substitutes must be fully equipped and present at the field to prepare for temporary use. The selected lineup and substitutes are as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan (South China Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan (Eastern Athletic Association) Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng (Eastern Athletic Association) Liang Rongzhao (South China Athletic Association) Song Lingsheng (Eastern Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Hou Chengtou (Eastern Athletic Association) Zou Wenzhi (Guanghua Athletic Association) Li Si (South China Athletic Association) Zhuo Shijin (Guanghua Athletic Association) Chen Bingtou (Eastern Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Substitutes: Li Deqi, Miao Huaguo, Liu Shidu, Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Hui Zhongyun, Wu Qixiang (Eastern Athletic Association), Yang Zixiang</p>
<p>Zhong Huilin, Huang Jingcong (Guanghua Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Based on the current situation, the above lineup is satisfactory. As for the Navy Team's lineup, it was also announced yesterday and is arranged as follows:</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Steedle, Burrows</p>
<p>Fraser, Dixon, Henyverall</p>
<p>Condie, Spillera, Henry, Tobin, Armstrong</p>
<p>Many people feel surprised that the Navy United did not select "Red-Haired" McAlister as goalkeeper. In fact, the red-haired guest has already gone with the ship, so Heather is used.</p>
<p>It seems that the strength of the Navy United is slightly inferior to that of the Chinese United. I predict that this time the Chinese United can be confident of victory and win the final. (The Football Field Grand Duke)</p>
<h3 id="e37">South China's Southern Expedition Team Beats the Tân An Team by Four Goals; Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai Performs Excellently <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Special Airmail Report from Saigon, 8th] Yesterday, at 4:00 PM on the 8th, South China played against the Vietnamese "Tân An Mixed Team" again, still held at the Saigon Stone Stadium. The Tân An Mixed is also a strong team here, with solid strength, and the audience expected a particularly exciting performance, so the number of people was no less than yesterday. The game started, and both sides moved their feet. The South China team had just charged up when a member of the Tân An team fell to the ground. His teammates helped him up, and he was able to fight again after a while. At this time, the South China team directly pressed the goal. The defenders worked hard to support, but the ball refused to move. Liu Qingcai advanced and retreated with certainty, with a force like crushing dry weeds. He quickly passed to Li Zhaorong to carry the ball forward. Chen Dexiong kicked it head-on and opened the scoring. The Tân An team suffered this blow in an instant and was unwilling to fall behind, so they launched a counterattack. The forwards advanced, but it was difficult to make progress. Da Tie Zhuo Zhenming defended the famous city, and also performed his customary bow technique, heading a top, even clearing the siege. The Tân An team became more and more motivated, making a comeback, but unfortunately they were brave but lacked strategy. Moreover, they were tackled to the ground and hooked the ball out. Soon, Liu Qingcai used guerrilla tactics, passing to Jingxiang. Yang Shuiyi rushed to receive the ball and shot it towards the opponent's goal, and another city fell. At this time, the Tân An team was exhausted, with only the ability to parry but not to counterattack. The South China team's three armies killed to the gate, but fortunately the goalkeeper was busy saving it, temporarily announcing safety. Although they wanted to counterattack, their way was blocked. Chen Deshi was as agile as a swimming dragon, dribbling the ball and flashing past the Tân An defender, passing to Jingxiang. They passed back and forth to each other. Jingxiang built another special service with a swallow-like tumbling, and the applause rose greatly. Before long, the Tân An team struggled again. Liu Songsheng got the pass, took advantage of the opponent's empty back and went straight in with a single knife, coming again, the silver whistle sounded long, and the first half ended. 4 to 0, the Tân An team was served a blank. The second half started, and the Tân An team tried to break the blank record, launching a large-scale counterattack, but it was still difficult to make progress in the middle. Feng Jingxiang waved his army to counterattack, turning it over to Songsheng, but his foot strength was too weak, and it was caught by the Tân An team's goalkeeper. The Tân An team took the opportunity to counterattack, and the South China team was awarded a corner kick. Fortunately, Li Zhaorong headed a swing, killing his way out of the siege. The Tân An team was also penalized soon after. The defenders Gao Yue headed it out. Before long, they counterattacked to the South China team's goal. Li and Mai, the two gates, were unable to save it. Fortunately, goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai pounced to the ground and caught it. Another member of the Tân An team took the opportunity to catch up, and Da Tie's shovel was pushed down. The referee declared it void, and after that, the Tân An team fought for a long time without a child. Da Tie never allowed them to cross the thunder pool half a step. At this time, South China was as solid as gold, calmly dealing with it. The Tân An team knew that the general trend had gone, and they had no intention of falling in love. 4 to 0, the Tân An team lost with a blank. In this battle, Zhang Rongcai performed the best in South China, Liu Qingcai and Li Guowei performed well, and the front line contributed greatly. The lineup is as follows (recorded by Zhu Zhaoheng)</p>
<p>South China Team</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohuan, Li Guowei, Liu Qingcai, Liu Weipei, Liu Songsheng, Li Zhaorong, Chen Guohui, Feng Jingxiang, Yang Shuiyi</p>

<h3 id="e45">Shortcut to Fitness (3) <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>-- Wang Juzheng</p>
<p>Spirit and perseverance are the keys to understanding fitness. No pain, no gain! Hard work, a little effort, and a little sweat are the only way to achieve true fitness. There is no other shortcut.</p>
<p>When engaging in fitness exercises, if we want to achieve the greatest effect, we must not only concentrate, but also have the following spirits. If we lack this spirit, exercise will not only be useless, but harmful.</p>
<p>(1) Do not be perfunctory. The method must be absolutely correct, the movements must be thorough, and there should be a deep understanding of the exercise.</p>
<p>(2) When exercising, you must "immerse yourself in it."</p>
<p>(3) The spirit of hard work, performing the prescribed number of repetitions until fatigue, and then stopping. We may feel hardship when starting this kind of exercise, but after getting used to it, we will feel comfortable. Therefore, do not interrupt exercise if you feel slightly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>(4) The spirit of perseverance and continuous efforts. Exercise must have regularity and a uniform order.</p>
<p>(5) A spirit of progress and fearlessness, and do not shrink back due to slight difficulties.</p>
<p>(6) Do not have extravagant hopes, and do not rush exercise. You must "build a solid foundation." Extravagant hopes are often the mother of "discouragement."</p>
<p>Before introducing the second set of exercises to everyone, I want to remind everyone to "continue practicing each set of exercises for about three days or a week, and then switch to the next set of exercises." (To be continued)</p>

<p>Entertainment... Lone Wolf of Paris</p>
<p>Lone Wolf of Paris</p>
<p>The content is about a bizarre theft, with a touch of comedy. The plot is quite tortuous, but many climaxes in the film pass by ordinarily. It tells the story of a world-famous jewel thief who has reformed and no longer commits theft. However, in Paris, in order to help a princess of a small country recover the pearls on her crown, he again uses his skillful thieving techniques, matching wits with the good duke of Ou Zhu. The task is completed moments before the princess's younger brother is about to ascend the throne, allowing the young monarch to take his place.</p>
<p>French actors Sissier Telier and Francis Delain are both very competent in this film.</p>
<p>Queen... Highlights in Color Film</p>
<p>Walt Disney's pen-and-ink animation films are beloved and welcomed by every audience, especially after the success of his bold attempt with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," which has drawn greater attention from movie enthusiasts. This screening of "Highlights in Color Film" selects and compiles his most recent works, a total of ten films, listed below:</p>
<p>"The Fox Hunt," "The Eccentric Parrot," "Livestock Symphony," "Golf Jokes," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Fairytale," "Whaling Story," "Lucky Day," "The Indomitable Bull," "Giant's Tale"</p>
<p>The animation techniques, as well as the coordination of colors and sounds, are all exquisitely perfect. The stories are concise and lively, filled with rich humor. In addition to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, there are also new creations. Among them, "The Indomitable Bull," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Fairytale," and "Giant's Tale" are particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>Peace... Scipione l'Africano</p>
<p>Scipione L'Africano</p>
<p>This is a historical film depicting a magnificent foreign war in ancient Rome. The grandeur of the sets and scenes in the film is unmatched by any other. The magnificent palaces and temples, the bloody battles on the battlefield, the charge of thousands upon thousands of cavalry and infantry, the advance of the elephant battle team, and the spectacle of ancient warships vividly portray the war between the two nations of that era on the screen. From the perspective of film art, this film is a successful work. However, because the film features well-known stars as its main draw, and it is also an Italian production, entirely in Spanish.</p>
<p>East... Booloo</p>
<p>Booloo</p>
<p>Although it cannot be said to be completely shoddy, it is not particularly outstanding either. However, the background and subject matter of the story are somewhat novel compared to ordinary beast films. Director Grajahlier-Rak, with his considerable experience in directing beast films, handles this film acceptably.</p>

<p>Zhong Yun's feet were painful and swollen for eight months, and he could not walk. Medical treatment in Hong Kong was ineffective.

Physician Zhou kindly sent effective pills. After taking several doses at $5 per dose, he was able to move and his mobility was restored. Truly a miraculous medicine!

<h3 id="e56">Physician Huang Zhuoru specializes in treating chronic toxic conditions that have not been cured by hundreds of treatments <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The difficulty of treating toxic conditions is well known. Although there are various reasons, they are all due to toxic germs invading the urethral side ducts and surrounding tissues, so it is impossible to eradicate the invading toxic germs. Therefore, to treat toxic conditions, it is necessary to reach the base of the toxic germs, the urethral side ducts. In view of this, this physician uses a Yinzhen dilatation injection treatment device to suck out the toxic system from the side ducts, and then injects the liquid medicine. The urethral side ducts naturally attract, and at the same time, the mucosa will be congested. The germicidal effect is strong, promoting the absorption of the infiltration of diseased cells, and the toxic disease can be cured. If you have the same disease, why not give it a try.</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3 id="e62">From Lian County to Hong Kong -- Nearly 800 Li on Foot <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>-- Xi Shi</p>
<p>Before the fall of Guangzhou, transportation between Hong Kong and Guangdong was extremely convenient. Now it has become very difficult. In addition, many of the inland highways close to the war zone have been automatically destroyed. Travelers, no matter in terms of the extra waste of money, time, spirit, and physical strength, feel overwhelmed by the complexity. This writer first went south on New Year's Day of this year, starting from Lian County in northwestern Guangdong, passing through Yangshan, Qingyuan, Sihui, Gaoyao, Xinxing, Kaiping, Xinhui, and Zhongshan counties, crossing Macau and arriving in Hong Kong, spending ten days and two days. During this period, except for more than one hundred li where I was able to take a highway bus, the rest of the journey was on foot. Those who are not accustomed to the labor of trekking will greatly lament its suffering.</p>
<p>Lian County, formerly the seat of Qinglian Prefecture, is located on the upper reaches of the Lian River, the distribution center for goods on the Small North River. After the provincial government moved there at the end of last month, military and political leaders of Guangdong Province and celebrities from all walks of life gathered there. Its political, economic, and cultural status suddenly became important. Around the time of the fall of Guangzhou, enemy planes flew to various counties and cities in Guangdong Province and indiscriminately bombed them. It was the most tragic bombing since the "July 7th Incident." After the provincial government and various important organs of South China moved there, the enemy planes bombed it for the first time, resulting in more than two hundred deaths and injuries, and new ruins. Since then, the prosperous street market of the past has become a desolate and quiet county town during the day. The impact has been that the compatriots in nearby counties that have not been bombed are all frightened by the rumors of war. This is a good example of "facts speak louder than words" in anti-Japanese propaganda, awakening many of our farmers who are still living in a drunken stupor or are completely ignorant of the national situation.</p>
<p>Previously, the route between Guangzhou and Lian County was mainly via the Guangwu Railway, transferring to a private boat at Lianjiangkou Station. Secondly, one could take a steamer to Qingyuan County seat, then transfer to a highway bus to Baishitan in the county, and then walk through Yangshan County. Originally, the Qingyang Highway (from Qingyuan to Yangshan) was built several years ago, but only the above-mentioned section is open to traffic. The majority of the unbuilt route accounts for the bulk of it. The Lianyang area (Lian County, Lianzhou, Yangshan) is mountainous and remote in the northwest. Compared with the culture of the Pearl River Delta, it is like heaven and earth. Therefore, the need for transportation and the countless tasks awaiting development are very important. However, the completion of the highway is still a distant prospect. Before it was affected by the war in southern Guangdong, the Lian River was originally the waterway through which goods and travelers in the counties passed. However, because it is a tributary of the North River, it flows south all year round. The average water depth is not shallow, but there are many turbulent currents and dangerous shoals. Traveling downstream is occasionally unstable, and boats are easily overturned. If traveling upstream, the boatmen must walk along the riverbank and pull the boat with ropes. The shouts to widen the breath of urgent oppression of the boatmen as the wind transmits into the ears as well as the sight of the boatman leaning forward and desperately struggling as they pull the rope, it can be known that the price to be paid by the struggle between manpower and nature is great, and the effect is minimal. The traffic difficulties of the Small North River are evident here.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, I took a boat downstream. The county towns of Lian County and Yangshan are about 110 li apart. With the help of the northwest wind, I arrived in five hours. There are two routes from the latter to Qingyuan Baishitan: one via Qi Gong Village and the other via Shuikou Market, divided into west and east branches. The former is longer and flatter, while the latter is shorter, but more rugged. For those who are not accustomed to long-distance walking, walking the 20-mile-long, rugged mountain road is indeed difficult, but there are still mountain sedan chairs available. The porters walk like flying, and their physical strength and tolerance for labor are impressive. They can reach it in ten hours, which is truly amazing and embarrassing for ordinary intellectuals. With the farmers' hard work and swift movements, if we can promptly implement progressive mass mobilization, and further strengthen the military and political training of the existing self-defense teams, once the enemy advances along the railway, they will be able to attack the enemy's left flank with fierce attacks without a doubt. When I passed through Yangshan County, I visited friends everywhere and inquired about county administration. There were many complaints. As far as wartime work is concerned, everyone is simply following orders and perfunctorily doing their jobs. I heard that the slogans recently posted in the county town are said to be dazzling and beautiful, but the reason for this is that the supervisory group of the Political Department of the Fourth War Zone suddenly arrived. This is also one of the most wonderful decorations in the rear during wartime.</p>
<p>After arriving in Qingyuan County seat by Qingyang Highway, what I saw along the way was no longer the slackness of the aforementioned places in preparing for the anti-Japanese war in the rear. At least the spirit of the general compatriots in life is more tense. Regardless of whether this superficial observation contains more or less content related to the impact of the anti-Japanese war, it made me feel a lot. Fortunately, the Qingyang Highway from Baishitan south is not only still undamaged, but there are also buses running on schedule, saving more than 90 li of walking. The Qingyuan Garrison Commander's patrol sentry along the line carried out traffic inspections as many as nine times. If any traveler is deemed suspicious, they will be thoroughly searched, and they will have to deal with various interrogations. If they are carrying luggage, it will be even more dizzying. However, in this extraordinary period, Qingyuan County seat is more than 100 li away from Sanshui. How dare good citizens not abide by the order of the rear? However, the special inspection can be carried out quite satisfactorily by following two principles: (1) being adept at questioning suspicious people, and (2) being quick at general inspections, so as not to be in two minds. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Although the principle of allowing direct cargo release from Ningbo to Shanghai upon merchants' request has been approved, detailed measures are pending review by the county government, party headquarters, and chambers of commerce. Now, the China-Italy Shipping Company's Enderun, American Weilihan Company's Xinanna, German Xiangyang Company's Moufu, Ningshao Company's agent for British Kaibo, and Huimin Company's agent for British Xixiangtai have all been approved by the Tenth Army Group Headquarters to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. However, before direct release is finalized, direct Shanghai-Ningbo (routes) are temporarily prohibited. Vessels must first sail to Daotai, Taizhou, and Wenzhou before entering Ningbo, primarily to load cargo. (1) Moufu specializes in silk. (2) Kaibo specializes in cotton. (3) Xixiangtai specializes in local paper. (4) Enderun and Xinanna specialize in local goods. The four vessels, Xixiangtai, Xinanna, Moufu, and Enderun, are scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Taizhou or Wenzhou and then to Ningbo tomorrow. When departing from Shanghai, in addition to passengers bound for Taizhou, they will also load goods approved for import into Zhejiang Province. The designated transportation vessels for the Wenzhou-Taizhou-Ningbo line are the Meida and Tangsai.</p>
<p>Reduced Water Transport Costs, Calculated at Half Price</p>
<p>Regarding the freight charges for each vessel, due to the soaring coal prices after the war, increased costs, and the detour involved, the Shanghai-Ningbo passenger ticket prices have continued to rise, causing a sudden increase in the burden on merchants and travelers from eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, Zhou Dalie, the chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, previously sent a letter requesting a reduction. After the news spread to Shanghai, Jing Hui, Zhu Meixian, and others from the local NingShao Shipping Company were the first to respond and immediately telegraphed the joint conference of the county's party, government, military, and police, requesting approval for direct Shanghai-Ningbo routes to reduce the companies' expenses, which would then lead to lower freight charges. Now, the China-Italy Shipping Company, considering the merchants' difficulties and facilitating cargo transportation, plans to take the lead in implementing a reduction. The company's Enderun, which is sailing to Ningbo today, will offer a 50% discount on all passenger and freight fares upon its return to Shanghai. It is reported that all customs brokers and passengers have been notified. It is also heard that other companies will follow suit.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Guangxi Province Highway Construction (1) <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Taifeng</p>
<p>and its scenery along the route</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>For more than a decade, the model provinces in China have been promoted as Shanxi and Guangxi. However, Guangxi's initial construction started more than a decade later than Shanxi Province. Nevertheless, its achievements have progressed rapidly and surpassed them. Taking highways as an example, the branches and trunks are crisscrossed, and wheeled vehicles reach everywhere. The past rugged paths have become smooth roads. The long journeys of the past are now completed from morning to evening. This has a significant impact on the implementation of government orders, the flow of goods, the dissemination of culture, and national defense construction. When the people of the country are shocked by the speed of Guangxi's construction progress, they should know that the success is largely due to the highways.</p>
<p>2. History</p>
<p>The start of Guangxi's roads can be traced back to the Yongwu Road in 1915, from Yongning to Wuming, a length of 41.2 kilometers. The project was started by the Army Engineering Battalion dispatched by the former General Headquarters. Later, due to military affairs, it was interrupted from time to time. In 1919, the first automobile was acquired. Later, the political situation stabilized, and the road administration was not repaired. Only a section from Yongning to Wutang was built in 1921, and the existing Nanan Highway was simply paved in 1922. Since 1924, the project has gradually become active. After 1928, it became more active. The principle of road construction was to first seek communication and then gradually improve. Therefore, roads were divided into sections and carried out simultaneously. However, due to the different difficulty of the projects and the different lengths of the routes, the roads could not be completed at the same time, and the routes were not connected. At that time, in order to quickly achieve traffic, districts were established to be responsible for the management of the entire district's engineering and traffic. The entire province had five districts: Ning, Liujiang, Guilin, Rong, and Nanning, all directly under the Construction Department. In November 1930, in response to environmental needs, the Liujiang and Guilin districts were changed to a contract system. In June 1932, the Provincial Highway Bureau was established, and all district management bureaus and contractor systems were abolished. The road administration of the entire province began to be unified. In terms of engineering, both branch and trunk lines were advanced simultaneously, and attention was paid to connecting roads in neighboring provinces to attach to the national highway system. For example, the Daliu Line from Datang through Yishan, Hechi to Liuzhai, which is the main line of the current Southwest Highway, was also completed at that time. In terms of traffic, postal applications were first launched in January 1932 to facilitate transportation. Initially, there were only eight cars. In July of the following year, due to business needs, the number of vehicles was greatly increased, and postal vehicles were changed to long-distance buses. The management of commercial vehicles was also regulated. For example, road maintenance fees and ticket fees had unified prices. Since then, active management has yielded remarkable results. In addition to new-style stations in major cities, small stations and military stops have also been gradually built, and repair shops have been set up in Yongning, Binyang, and Liuzhou. For the rivers Huaiji, Ermenjiang, Qingshuijiang, Honghe, Rongjiang, and Yongjiang, where the river surface is vast and iron bridges could not be built, wharfs were built on both sides to facilitate the loading of vehicles. As of March last year, the total number of public and private vehicles reached 756, of which 278 belonged to the Highway Administration Bureau, an increase of 32 times compared with seven years ago. There were 279 vehicles belonging to the Automobile United Business Association, 50 vehicles belonging to the automobile companies of each county, and 149 vehicles belonging to other public and private institutions and private individuals. Calculated by the proportion of the population of the province, there is one car for every 14,000 people. Although it is not comparable to the United States, where there is one car for every four people, it can be considered the leader among the inland provinces.</p>
<p>3. Detailed Description of Each Route</p>
<p>It has been said that construction and politics, economy, and culture have mutual causal effects. Progress in construction often provides great convenience for promoting politics, culture, and economy. At the same time, political clarity often benefits construction. Guangxi's politics have boasted the "three richnesses and three autonomies" policy to the world, so its people are rich in organizational power and enthusiastically participate in public works. When the earthwork for each road begins, it is necessary to first investigate the able-bodied men aged 18 to 40 along the route. The village chiefs or equivalent personnel in each section are assigned as section chiefs, and a certain number of able-bodied men are gathered into groups, with 50 people in each group, and a specific section is designated to be completed within a limited time. Although the wages are meager (each worker receives a food allowance of 15 cents per day, with 73 cubic feet completed per day considered one worker), sometimes they are all voluntary, but there are almost no cases of escape. The land requisitioned from the people is generally not paid for, except for the exemption of grain, and there are few complaints. This is not possible without daily training. The success of Guangxi's road administration has its origins.</p>
<p>3. Detailed Description of Each Route</p>
<p>As of now, the total length of highways in the province is approximately 5,300 kilometers, of which approximately 3,100 kilometers belong to provincial roads (including the 329 kilometers from Liuzhou to Liuzhai, which is now included in the national highway category), 2,900+ kilometers are open to traffic, and approximately 2,100 kilometers belong to county roads, 500+ are open to traffic. The following is a description of the provincial roads that are open to traffic, approximately 2,900+ kilometers, for the convenience of writing, based on the starting points of each line, divided into four centers: Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, and Yongning.</p>
<p>The purpose of road construction is to facilitate people's travel. However, as society evolves, the needs of all parties gradually change. Therefore, the choice of route must be determined by what special value it has in order to fully utilize its effectiveness. Guangxi's highways initially aimed to promote politics, military affairs, and culture, and later focused on economy, to clear trade and adjust needs. Therefore, the resources and products of the cities along the route are also briefly described. This is one aspect.</p>
<p>Building scenery, promoting tourism, and attracting tourists to increase national income invisibly have been recognized by world economists. According to statistics, after the European War, European countries earned tens of millions of US dollars annually from American tourists. Looking back at China, the most earned in a year was only 6 million US dollars. This is because traffic was previously blocked, making it difficult to travel, causing famous mountains and beautiful waters to be unknown to the world. This is truly regrettable. The scenery of Guangxi is also the same. Now that the highways are smooth, the scenic spots along each route should be listed to inform travelers of where they are traveling, to alleviate the fatigue of long journeys, and to contribute to the national economy. This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>The quality of highway engineering has a significant impact on the safety, speed, and fuel consumption of vehicles. Therefore, the condition of each broken bridge, road surface, slope, and road is also briefly described. This is the third aspect.</p>
<p>A. Guilin as the Center</p>
<p>Guilin is the capital of Guangxi Province. The city was built by Li Jing of the Tang Dynasty. It is located on the west bank of the Tan River, with a population of more than 100,000. People from Hunan are quite numerous. The prosperous commercial streets are in the southeastern part of the city. The nearby agricultural products include water chestnuts, hemp, tea, mushrooms, lily bulbs, pomelos, longan, persimmons, tobacco, and tung oil. Water chestnuts are particularly famous, with a sweet taste and no residue, with an annual output of more than 120,000 dans. The weaving industry has more than 400 households, weaving more than 290,000 bolts per year. The best is Liutang cloth, which is sold to northern Guizhou in addition to self-use. The bamboo weaving industry is also famous, with more than 400 households, producing more than 90,000 bundles per year, which are mostly sold to other places, as far as Tianjin. In addition, Guilin Yihua wine, with its mellow taste, is famous far and wide, with more than 40 households brewing it.</p>
<p>Guilin is located on a high ground about 208 meters above sea level, standing on the mountains and enjoying beautiful scenery. The most famous mountain is Duxiu Peak, which stands independently and proudly in the city. Yan Yanzhi used to study there and wrote the special "Not as good as Duxiu Peak, towering between the city walls". The name of Duxiu Peak originated from this. Lishan, commonly known as Elephant Trunk Hill, is where the Yang River (the upper source of the Xiang River) and the Li River converge. There is a cave at the foot of the mountain called Water Moon, with the Li River running through it. Other mountains such as Douji Mountain, Chuan Mountain, Crescent Mountain, Longyin Rock, Qili Mountain, Putuo Rock in the east of the city, Fubo Rock, Yaoshan in the northeast, Yushan in the north, and Yinshan in the west are all green cliffs and beautiful. Truly, there are so many beautiful things that one cannot see them all. Due to space limitations, they cannot be described in detail. Historical sites such as the Caiyan Rock on Guashan Mountain, where the loyal ministers of the Ming Dynasty, Zhang Tongchang and Qu Shiyu, were martyred, the Dahuangcheng, where the King of Gui established his capital, the Han Dynasty General Fubo Mountain, the Yushan Mountain dedicated to Yu Shun, and the Zhennan Peak, which houses the Dali Pingman stone carvings, are especially precious.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Developed Inter-Provincial Trade Among Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi Provinces: Exchange of Goods to Smooth the Source <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Fuzhou Correspondence] The inter-provincial trade between Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces has developed greatly after the efforts of the authorities of the four provinces to promote it. For example, the transportation of slab sugar from Guangdong to Jiangxi and the separate transportation of local tobacco from western Fujian to Jiangxi and Guangdong are especially in short supply. Recently, due to Jiangxi Province's poor harvest last year and surplus grain, there is a severe shortage of food salt. The Inter-Provincial Trade Commission sent personnel to Fujian to discuss the exchange of Jiangxi rice for Fujian salt. Currently, salt prices in Fujian Province have gradually increased, with rice prices rising from five or six yuan per dan to eight or nine yuan, and salt prices rising from seven or eight yuan per dan to twelve or thirteen yuan, which is proof of smooth roads. The daily necessities of Fujian are all transported from Chaozhou and Shantou, which keeps prices stable. Salt affairs affect people's livelihoods. The reason is that the traffic between Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, whether direct or indirect, is very convenient, so goods can be exchanged, and the source can be smoothed. Recently, Jiangxi, eastern Guangdong, and western Fujian have made further connections. In addition to the direct remittance implemented by the branch offices of the three provincial banks in the border counties, with a remittance fee of five cents per hundred yuan, the banknotes issued by the three banks can also be used interchangeably to seek financial flow. In addition, the administrative commissioners of the border areas of the three provinces will each send representatives to set up barter trade measures. For any kind of industry or commerce that a province lacks, the industrial and commercial provinces are welcome to take the lead in operating it, and guarantees will be provided. For example, in the eighth administrative region, in villages such as Qidu, Qidu, Qidong, and counties such as Huichang, business people engaged in hardware, printing, cloth, and paper are often welcomed to take the lead in operating. In addition to absolutely safeguarding safety, they can also help hire boats, order vehicles, and rent houses and land. If merchants have difficult matters, they can submit them to the local county government, which will forward them to the relevant county government of the province for consultation.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Concerning War <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— A Commoner</p>
<p>The Second World War is gradually brewing in every corner of the earth, with approximately 600 million people already engulfed in the flames of war. In the frenzied and greedy rampage of fascism, it is evident that the chaotic situation, even more so than in 1914, is unavoidable.</p>
<p>War, how ordinary and yet mysterious a thing it is in the minds of ordinary people!</p>
<p>Those inclined towards fatalism say that war is a product of "heavenly principles in cycles," therefore, the occurrence of war is inevitable, unconditional, and irreversible, because: "There is no power to reverse fate," "Those destined to suffer calamity cannot escape."</p>
<p>The idealists' "view of war," however, is completely different. They believe that the occurrence of war is a completely accidental political aberration, that is, a mere sudden shift in social ideology.</p>
<p>The former exaggerates the inevitability of war and mythologizes it, believing that this "cycle" of "heavenly principles" is immutable, and that mankind can only be arbitrarily manipulated in this cyclical phase, "given life or death, subject to their whims," and therefore presents a passive state in war, indulging in dissipation, pleasure-seeking, and seeking temporary security, unaware of the nation-state, and even less understanding of the "door to survival."</p>
<p>The latter does not deeply see the causes of war. For example, in the case of China's war of resistance, in their eyes, it is purely caused by the excessive excitement of the Chinese people during the July 7th Incident. If they had been more moderate at the time, then this major upheaval could have been calmed down. Now, China's insistence on resistance in their eyes is also due to the general public's "unabated anger" and "stubbornness," neglecting the "peaceful" spirit of "calmness and tranquility" and "mutual support."</p>
<p>Both of the above concepts are a complete misunderstanding or distortion of the true meaning of war.</p>
<p>Because war is not a cycle of worldly affairs, but an evolution of worldly affairs. War is the change in social forms in a certain stage of historical dialectical development. History is made by people, of course, war is also man-made: Inequality between people and groups of people incites war. At the same time, war ends when equality is achieved through the efforts and struggles of people. However, this is not an immutable equilibrium or a state of flux; after the destruction of each war, construction follows, and continuing in a certain peaceful situation, new inequalities arise to a high degree and then war erupts. In the midst of each peaceful day's comings and goings, people's culture progresses. At the same time, in each process of war's occurrence and end, the content of human society also leaps forward.</p>
<p>Since war is a change in social forms, the inevitability that determines the outbreak and unfolding of war is still the content and essence of society. It is as if the World War of 1914 was due to the division of imperialists. The reason for this division was determined by the high degree of development of capitalism in each country, and the high degree of development of capitalism was due to the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production in its social essence. It is even more like today's Chinese War of Resistance, which is a struggle for liberation unfolded under the high pressure of Japanese imperialism under the historical realities of feudalism. The essence of Chinese society makes China stand in a semi-colonial position, and at the same time, its development also makes China struggle upward from the position of a semi-colony. On the other hand, the Japanese fascists' aggression against China is also because the evolution of their own domestic exploitation system has to seek markets abroad. In short, all wars have their essential differences. Today, our War of Resistance is not some "Thirty Years' War" or some "Hundred Years' War"-like war of the feudal era. The wars in the feudal era were completed and perfectly resolved in fulfilling their missions. Our war must also be resolved under the principle of the liberation and victory of our nation, rather than using the abstract concepts of "peace," "support," and "non-aggression" as preconditions for resolving war.</p>
<p>We resolutely oppose all distortions and misunderstandings of war. We must vigorously refute those erroneous arguments that are issued with malicious intentions, and prevent their toxins from being injected into the masses.</p>
<p>Now, war has been widely unfolded in China and Spain, and at the same time, other places are also filled with a strong smell of gunpowder. We are not at all alarmed or shaken by the cruel expansion of war. We only calmly observe it with our correct perspective, and constantly prepare and deal with it:</p>
<p>Regarding the war that has already come or is unfolding, our basic attitude is to take "national liberation" and "human liberation" as the highest principles for resolving war. However, it is impossible to seek the adjustment and resolution of war through compromise and abstract "peace." We should possess the great spirit of "fighting for true peace through war" and "eliminating war with war" to strive for an independent, free, and happy new China! And strive for the coming of a new era of equality!</p>

<p>— Li Yiyan</p>
<p>The Dapeng small ferry sailed into Shayu Chung. The gate on the ship opened. On the left was the coast, and many people on this side stood up, gazing anxiously. I also stood up and looked out from the opening, seeing a stretch of golden sandy beach on the opposite side.</p>
<p>"Arrived! Arrived!" Someone shouted like this, and the whole ship suddenly stirred, scrambling to pick up their luggage.</p>
<p>The water was shallow dozens of feet from the shore, and the steamer could not move forward. It swung its tail and slowly moved, waiting for the small boat to come and ferry the passengers.</p>
<p>Due to the commotion of the passengers, the steamer rocked, tilting.</p>
<p>"Hey!..." Someone exclaimed in surprise, afraid that the ship would capsize and sink. Because the passengers were too crowded, this worry did not seem excessive. Especially for those who took this ferry for the first time, they could not help but be frightened.</p>
<p>The first small boat arrived beside the ship. Passengers rushed to the gate, hoping to leave the ship quickly, get on the small boat quickly, and land quickly. Those who were single and had little luggage naturally had the advantage. The five of us traveling together did not have much luggage, so it would have been possible to leave quickly; but we were carrying three boxes of medicine together, which were heavier than anyone else's luggage, and it was not easy to move them down to the small boat, so we had to let others go first.</p>
<p>Several small boats rowed over one after another. The larger ones could hold more than twenty people, and the smallest ones could only hold five or six people, including the boat woman (there were few boatmen). With several stone people on the ship, relying on these few small boats to ferry in turn took too much time. At first, we planned to let them all leave before leaving; but we still had to travel fifty or sixty miles to get to Danshui. Seeing this situation, we didn't know how long we would have to wait, and felt that we couldn't wait any longer. Seeing a gap, we quickly dragged the medicine box to the gate. The crew member saw that it was emergency medicine and also helped us stop others, letting us pass the medicine box down to the small boat first. However, the small boat was already full of people, and it was difficult to find a foothold. Comrade Huang reluctantly jumped down, lying on the medicine box. The four of us could no longer jump down, so we had to wait for another small boat.</p>
<p>Soon, another small boat came, but it was very small. There were two boat women on the boat originally. Looking at the remaining space, it seemed that it could not accommodate all four of us. The crew member told me not to go down again; but I wanted to accompany them, and finally risked jumping down. As soon as our feet landed on the plank, the small boat left the ship.</p>
<p>"Don't move—don't move—moving will cause it to sink!" The boat woman at the bow shouted loudly.</p>
<p>My position was at the bow, and I had not yet straightened my body. It was neither sitting nor squatting, a most uncomfortable posture. But watching the undulating small boat, wrestling with the turbulent waves of the sea, how could I move even a bit—</p>
<p>The small boat reached its destination, resting aground. I was the first to stand up. There was still tide water under the bow and I could not jump down; in an instant, the tide retreated backward, and I quickly jumped down and then quickly fled forward. Looking back, the tide rushed to the place where I had just landed. The second to jump down was Mr. Liao, who also jumped after making sure the tide had retreated; but after he jumped down, his movements were not agile, and his feet had not yet left, and the tide rushed up again, so his pair of shoes got wet. ...</p>
<p>Thank goodness, we finally safely stepped onto the land, and can start our work.</p>

<p>Because we had a female comrade traveling with us, the news quickly spread throughout this small village with less than ten households. So, with an attitude of watching a novelty, men, women, old and young all rushed to the hillside; at first, some felt that the female soldier was strange, but later they struck up a conversation with each other, and the more they talked, the closer they became. On the contrary, they felt that this female soldier was kind and respectable.</p>
<p>"What should we do when the Japanese soldiers come?"</p>
<p>When we raised this question, we really did not expect that Mr. Yu would answer so firmly: "Fight—fight as guerrillas—we can't escape anymore when we get to our hometown!"——Experience, the training of the times!——"Is it not good to organize now?"</p>
<p>"It was originally well organized, and the county was asked to issue guns, but not only were the guns not issued, but even the guerrillas were disbanded; it was said that before the place was occupied, it could not be established, but in fact, alas——"</p>
<p>He sighed and stopped talking, but his son, a young man who had studied at a Nanjing middle school, spoke out!</p>
<p>"I heard that the people above are afraid. Are they still afraid of the masses at this time? Damn it——" (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Qiu Yang</p>
<p>"Brother Jian Gong was bombed to death by enemy planes in Jixian County, I am deeply grieved—" These words jumped into my eyes in the dim twilight, proving that this was not a dream, that this was clearly a true and tragic fact. I looked to the northwest corner from afar, bleak with dark, heavy clouds of sorrow, the mournful north wind, as if bringing the pungent smell of blood. My heart, at first felt endless pain like being stabbed with a knife, and finally surged up with a fire of unknown anger. I do not shed tears, I do not mourn, I want to avenge the deep hatred of the sea of blood, I want to advance along the bloodstains of the dead!</p>
<p>I met Mr. Wen in the autumn three years ago. At that time, I began to get close to social sciences, and read his political economy and some very good philosophy books. Asking about them, I learned that he was our fellow villager, a very active, struggling young man who had been in prison and had been a university professor. But he had always been in the north, and I had no chance to meet him. Last spring, on a snowy day, I began to shake hands with him for the first time upstairs at No. 16 Yicheng Dongli, Danfeng Street, Hankou. The most profound impression he left on me was that he had the tall stature of a northerner, a very argumentative and erudite gentleman. He had absolute optimism about the victory of the War of Resistance, and he also had very active, resolute, and courageous actions in the War of Resistance. At that time, he had just come to Hankou from the front line of Shanxi Province, and he wanted to go back again, but because of certain problems, he could not realize his plan to go back. To us, he told many valuable experiences and methods of conducting ourselves in the world, and also encouraged us to study hard. He had forward-thinking thoughts and a fiery passion. Facing him, I felt that he had a solemn and great aura, and at the same time, I felt that he was a kind person who was very easy to approach and cared about us.</p>
<p>I still remember: one snowy afternoon, he sent me north, personally going to the Huo Dong Station in Dazhi Dou. Because the train would not leave until tomorrow morning, he invited me to a coffee shop that night to see me off. He earnestly instructed me with many good words, and also introduced me to many famous figures in the cultural world, telling me to find them for help or get to know them after I went to the distant northern country. On the quiet streets at midnight, when we returned from Jianghan Road together, he also kindly gave me two cans of biscuits and canned food. On Jianghan 1st Road, I saw him disappear into the black corner before I returned to my apartment—the Huagong Hotel. I thought that this farewell was temporary. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we could always see him again and learn from him. Who would have thought that the last handshake on Jianghan Road was the eternal farewell.</p>
<p>After arriving in the north, I did not send him a letter because of the obstruction of transportation. However, I knew from the mouths of friends that he was a design committee member of a certain department. Later, I heard that he had returned to Guangzhou. In early August, I returned to Hankou, and at the same time, I knew that he would come to Hankou. I waited for him to come every day, until August 12th. (I was preparing to leave for Hengyang at 6 pm that day.) That morning happened to be when enemy planes bombed Wuhan heavily. I was taking refuge in the French Concession, and unfortunately, he came to find me during this tense time. According to the mother, when he knew that I was afraid of enemy planes and was escaping, he smiled, saying that he would come again at night. It just so happened that I had to leave Hankou that day, and I didn't have the chance for a final meeting. Now, I silently think of his smile, probably thinking that I was afraid of death. Or perhaps he was laughing at my childish state? I can't guess what he was thinking. Now, I can only forever cherish his smile!</p>
<p>Farewell—Mr. Wen! In the bitter cold northwest corner, there are countless Chinese sons and daughters who have already followed your bloodstains to complete your unfinished cause of saving the country, exterminating the enemy and avenging your deep hatred and the deep hatred of so many martyred compatriots. We believe that the youth of our next generation will not disappoint you! We will definitely be able to save our China and drive the enemy out of China! Rest in peace! Mr. Wen!

<h3 id="e74">Random Thoughts on "Counting White Olives" <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ding</p>
<p>For the sake of the issue of writing for the countryside, everyone has put forward many valuable opinions. It seems that now is not the time for "theoretical" exploration, but should be the time to move on to "technical" research. Today, seeing He Hua'an's "Writing for the Countryside and Folk Literature," reminded me of the style of folk literature called "Counting White Olives," and I felt that it was worth promoting, so I will talk about it briefly.</p>
<p>I don't know when "Counting White Olives" began, but it is often used in Cantonese opera. As a kind of "dialogue" with rhythm and beat, inserting this clear and pleasant "white" dialogue into the tight and strict gongs and drums is very helpful to the effectiveness of the drama. The evaluation of Cantonese opera in terms of artistic guard is set aside for the time being, but Cantonese opera is loved by the masses in the south, and "Counting White Olives" is especially welcomed universally, which is an iron fact. Therefore, "Counting White Olives" can be separated from the shackles of drama and stand alone. Street performers and small vendors who sell snacks often use the method of "Counting White Olives" in order to be unique and attract customers, using the clapper to beat out the rhythm and singing interesting rhyming sentences to praise his goods. As a result, his business often gets unexpected gains.</p>
<p>This illustrates the value of "Counting White Olives."</p>
<p>However, perhaps some people doubt whether this thing that is liked by coolies and servants can ascend to the "Hall of Elegance"? If there are people who have this doubt, they will ignore the fact that old bottles can be filled with new wine; in fact, the question is whether we have "new wine," whether there are people who are willing to offer wine. I used to do propaganda work in a certain rural area. In a "spare time" in a commemorative meeting, I invited local villagers to try a "Counting White Olives" with new content, which won warm applause and requests for "one more." Recently, at the poetry recitation and New Year's Eve party of the Chinese Arts Association in Hong Kong, Mr. Luo Ying performed "Counting White Olives" with the new theme of current affairs report, which also received a good evaluation.</p>
<p>Analytically, the reason why "Counting White Olives" is welcomed by the masses is probably for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1.  It has rhythm and rhyme (at least it also has rhyme in the foot), which is pleasing to the ear.</p>
<p>2.  The language is colloquial, close to the lives of the masses, and easy to understand.</p>
<p>3.  Most of them are satirical and humorous.</p>
<p>4.  It comes with Cantonese opera, and the content (in the past) contains a strong feudal consciousness, catering to the taste of the "old heads."</p>
<p>However, perhaps someone may doubt "Although 'Counting White Olives' is colloquial enough, it is not serious enough." Yes, the position of "Counting White Olives" in the past in opera contains the meaning of adjusting the audience's mental fatigue and increasing the audience's deep understanding of the plot, so it is better to take it lightly than to be too serious; but now we take the "Counting White Olives" out of the nest of Cantonese opera, and the "new wine" that is infused is full of the consciousness of resisting aggression, then] the content determines the form, and the new "Counting White Olives," although it has a light habit, does not hinder its seriousness.</p>
<p>"Counting White Olives" needs to be promoted by cultural people, and cultural people need to carry out the work of "reform." Comrades who are working in the countryside, I hope you don't forget to bring this bottle of new wine with you!</p>
