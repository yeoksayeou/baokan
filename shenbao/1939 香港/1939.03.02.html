<p>社評</p>
<h3>提防侵略者的陰謀</h3>
<p>倫敦二十七日海通社電傳「每日捷報」消息，稱：「日本政府現巳採取一完全意外的步驟，向中國媾和。日本曾向華方建議，組織一蔣委員長任要職之新政府。如重慶方面接受此項建議時，則在中國中部南部之日軍，大半卽將撤退……」。媾和消息之散佈巳不止一次兩次，考究其內慕當不外乎侵略者的陰謀，若謂中國當局在被侵略戰爭的慘烈影響已至極度的今日，還有中途媾和的可能，實在無稽，近於痴人作夢。</p>
<p>我們對於這種消息要特別注意的，是東西侵略者共同的陰謀，日本侵略者因爲預定的作戰期間行將滿期（原定一年結束戰爭，一年整理佔領區），急於結束中日戰爭，確是事實，但是它必須得到侵略戰爭所爭的絕六代價，始肯罷休。最近原擬乘佛郎哥軍隊之逼近法境，德意牽制英法的機會，爭取寸九個月來侵略戰爭的代價。所以，最近除了侵佔海南島外，還造成了上海租界的嚴重局勢，卽在南北各戰場也都有較積極的軍事行動，閩粵沿海各據點也在其盤算之中。但是事勢竟出了日本的意料之外，英法竟以承認佛郎哥政府的手段謀穩定歐局，日本遂喪失了用進一步的威迫求得代價的條件，於是又欲運用它的政治陰謀來補償。</p>
<p>我們若就德意日正在柏林開着軍事外交的聯席會議加以考察，則這運媾和消息的用意，更不難想到另一種根據。希特勒雖希望日本「征服」了亞洲，但他尤其熱望日本有充分的力量，用以進攻蘇聯：所以中日戰爭擴大到武漢以後，德國即再三警告日本：勿消耗實力過大。在德國侵略對象當中，烏克蘭佔極重要的地位，但是德國不能無日本在東方夾攻蘇聯的響應而進攻烏克蘭。蘇日的漁約問題現已遏至嚴重的階段，四月捕魚期間將發生如何事燮，是任何人所不能預料的，希特勒不能忽視這個機會，更不能不再度警吿日本：早日結束中日戰爭吧！</p>
<p>因歐局緩和而日本失去用武力的威脅保障海南島的建設以後，日本只好用緩和英法乃允美國的策略來維持它在海南島的軍事建設，以便完成未來太平洋戰爭上的兩隻鐵拳——臺灣與海南島。日機轟炸　港新界的試探已碰到了英國的硬釘子。派艦海南島的問題也已上了英國議會的日程，法國為保衛廣州彎及安南屬地，當然更加注意海南島的問題。日本在這情勢下，只好運用欺騙的手段，緩和英法各國了。相信日本欲決心挑發太平大戰，還需要若千時候，等待它在太平洋上的海軍建設更加健全化。</p>
<p>我們對於每一　和的消息應該特加注意的是日本所提誘降的件條。在日本政府一再宣言否認我國民政府為談判對手，一再污蔑我抗×最高領袖的今日，突然來個「日本曾向華方建議，組織一以蔣委員長任要職之新政府，如重慶方面接受此項建議時，則在中國中部旗南部之日軍，大半卽將撤退」的消息，實在有點奇特，即令此項消息可靠，我們對於日本的提議也絕對不能置信。日本侵略者沒有絲毫信義可言，正如在日本軍政要人羣中並且參與過機密工作的意大利人樊司派所言：『……我更不相信日本軍部，他們說與中國爲友，與他國為友，都是不可靠的。」我們數十年來上了日本不少的當；我們在這存亡危急的關頭，更要提防侵略者招降的政治陰謀，堅決拿定爭取最後勝利的主意。</p>
<p>日本還在欺騙着世界、特別是英法。日本這個媾和的希望，用意是要英使法出來替它打江山，英美法倘若存着居間調停的幻想，那末就上了日本的大當。日本今日為完成海南島的建設而緩和英美法，他日太平洋海軍建設完全成功的時侯，就必反面驅逐英美法的勢力出於太平洋之外。日本之有今日都是世界各強國上當所造成的。正如樊司派所言：「日本之所以興旺都是歐美各國的過分獎勵所造成，英國尢應負責……」，「他們（指日本）正在開始着一個狂妄的吹牛，而各國的讓他狂吹，確是一件可以悲觀的事」（樊氏在香港的談話。英美法今日應加努力的，第一如何使日本放棄海南島；第二如何使日本軍隊全部退出中國境界，恢復「九一八」以前的狀態。</p>
<h3>晉西戰事</h3>
<p>— 郭從周</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶杭訊〕汾河和呂梁山、大然地　成了晉西這　區域、督西北的管涔山、發源了汾河、南流經靜樂、陽曲、左納洞水、右受文谷河、逾新絳折向西流、至河津注入黃河、這是黃河的第二大支　、長約六百九十公里、構成了「汾河地海」呂梁山北接管涔山、縱列於黃河汾河之間、至河濱而止於龍門山、　梁　及其支脈、使晉西成爲複雜的『塊　山地』、</p>
<p>去年三月間、臨　撤退後、晉西各縣也相褂淪入×手、但經過了一個很短的時期、我終擊退了盤据的×軍、次第收復各縣、可是東　的同備路、北面的汾離綫、南面的　絳、稷山、河津、都在×人手裏、這樣、使晉西成爲三面受×包圍的形勢、雖然這樣、我們却恢復並鞏固了這一區域的政權、建立游擊根據地，而成為支持山西抗戰的政治軍事的中心、顯　、在×之側後方、這是一種重大的戚脅、</p>
<p>最近一月以來、×人對晋西的進攻、基於什麼企圖呢、</p>
<p>第一、進兵呂梁山「打破政治中心」去年春季「八路圍攻」吉縣時、×方之口號）、以期「掃蕩」呂梁山游擊根據地、最近發現×在大麥郊的標語是『打倒縣政　、掃蕩游擊隊」、便是很顯然的證明、</p>
<p>第二、同蒲路時　我軍破壞、後方聯絡　不斷感受威脅、企沿汾河西岸修築公路、另闢交通綫、控制汾河各渡口、截斷晉東晉西之聯絡、同時侵人晋西谷縣、一面封鎖呂梁山東出各山隘、一面修復汾陽—隰　—大寧—蒲縣—臨汾半圓形之公路、而與汾西公路相聯接、以便增　補充、使呂梁山我軍之活動、時時受其壓制、</p>
<p>第三、黃河壺口以南、師家灘以北、內河道窄狹、水流湍急、每歲冬李結冰、×圖利用「冰橋」、渡河略取陝北、牽制我軍、以配合其「第四期作　中心』進攻蘭州之戰略、</p>
<p>因此、×人遂於上年十二月初、動員同蒲綫駐軍、北起憲石、南迄曲侯、全般地渡汾西犯、那時鐵道東西我軍、立卽協同夾擊、除開價値卅萬元的五龍宮被×燒毀外、×人並沒有得到什麽、同待晉西普降大雪、道路爲阻、×人的企圖便暫時沈寂下來、然而、×人的進攻還是凖備着、在同蒲沿綫不斷地增調大軍、計汾陽、孝義約六七十、洪洞、趙城三千、曲沃、侯馬、新絳三千、河津稷山二千分路大舉西侵、第二次的進攻、是十二月廿四日開始的、（未完）</p>
<h3>本報中學生論文賽入選稿　寒假期內中學生的救亡工作問題　第一名知用中學張大璉</h3>
<p>在中國一個中學生的可貴，是大家那知這的，尤其是在現在這向在暴的×人抗戰的時候，我們的學校不知有多少被炸坍和焚燬了；不知有多少中學生遭到了　　、帶着他們的學　——普通一般人難得得着的學識，並不曾向我們的國家貢獻一點點，就倒在路邊，躺在坍了的屋頂下，靜靜的死去了。或者在四處流浪着，找不着他們的敎室，在這種情形之下，我們這些還存留　的幸運兒，將負起怎樣的責任而向着救亡</p>
<p>我們知道許多人所不知道的，我們實在應該盡我們的能力做我們所應該做的事，但我們是止在受着救育的人：就因爲這一點，我們缺乏充足的時間。可是現在寒假來了，這是發揮我們全部力景的好機會。我們應該緊握住它。</p>
<p>如果在寒假到來之先，我們先將時間分配一下，立定一個工作的計劃，然後照着這計劃一步一步去實行，這樣我們的工作就會　有系統的，而它的效果也一定要比散漫地，隨　地做去的要好得多：</p>
<p>對於我們中學生在寒假期中的救亡工作，我們可以把它分爲兩部分來說。。</p>
<p>第一許多人把救亡工作看成是　義的，只以為荷着擔跑上戰塲去，或者至少要做做組織和訓練民衆的工作，或者宣傳募捐之類的工作，才能算是救亡工作，而根本忽略了自我　　的重要性，我們十分知道「建國必成」是緊接着「抗戰必勝」的，如果我們不在這時候把自己教育的一個建國期中的最需要的，最有用的人，將來這建國的責任放在誰的肩頭上丫而就說在最切近的抗戰上。我們是要　起組織的訓練的宣傳的工作的。是否我們所知道的已足夠應付這一切，而能夠做得十分好？這很容易明白，答案一定是「不能夠」，如果我們自己對抗戰的認識不清楚，我們怎樣能夠把握住宣傳的中心，而不只喊着：「我們要抗戰！」這一句空話呢？如果我們不能對時事加以分板　透視，難道我們就只讀讀報紙給不認識字的人聽嗎？如果我們自己的理論基礎不打好，我們怎樣能夠去組織和訓練民衆呢？難道我們用一個代數公式或者幾何是最好的教育，可是如果你沒有法子將他們組織起來而走到他們之間去，你怎樣去學習呢？</p>
<p>這些問題已十分明白的告訴了，我們自我教育在整個的救亡工作上的重要，而它自身也必就是主要的救亡工作之一，在橫擇在我們面　的這個世界，和這個大時代裏，我們所要學的是太多太多了。我們並不否認學校所給我們的教育，那是決定「那國必成」這個信念的主要的根據。而自我教育則無論在抗戰者或建國的階段裏，都是最需要和最有用的東西。</p>
<p>一個人不必，也不可能造成一個『路　通』，然而為了適應這客觀環境的需要，我們的知識應該是要多方面的。一切的事件和學術，都有它在哲學上的觀點和根據，所以如果我們不對哲學有一個清河的認識，我們所做的一切都可能是錯誤的，或至少沒有它的「靈魂」。社會科學，和其他各式的抗戰理論的書籍，在書店裏是堆得滿滿的，這在平時，常為着時間的關係，使人們無法讀到，而在這寒假裏，雖然也不能讀到許多，也至少是一個讀書的絕好機會了。還有一點非常重要的，就是我們讀這些　的態度，應該是研究式的和批評式的。</p>
<p>要是有了幾個志趣相同的朋友，很可以組織一個讀書座談會。將一本書提出，由大家研究和討論。這樣不但大家可以互相指導。互相幫叻，使自已得到　多的益處，而且大家的書互相借閱，也可以多應好訾書哩！</p>
<p>除此以外，許多人都忽略了一件事，就是不僅目我批許是最好的，最有效果的自我教育，無論是在國體裏，或是對於個人，在一件工作之後，或在某一時期，將自已以前工作，作一次總檢討，好的永這保留，錯誤的攻不妥的、儘量的批評和改善，，這個方法的執行，需要着對工作上極端　率的，坦白的，和最大的熱誠，而這一個方法的採取，可以使一個團體團結得更緊密，工作得更完善。對於個人也完至一樣。</p>
<p>第二才晚到對外的救亡工作。</p>
<p>我們首先要注意到的問題，就是環境問題，各人各處的環境都不同，同時我們怎樣展開工作的方式也就各別，無須與選擇一個較好的環境，每個人都　在自已的崗位上，而且，我們除了把握住環境，和適應　環境之外，如果覺得這環境的不善，我們還要用種種的技巧改變這環境。</p>
<p>對於對外的救亡工工的種種方式，用不着都談到，只把它混統的分成團體的和個人的二方面來說：</p>
<p>在這裏，用不着誇張。說　實話，在我們的四圍還有，許多人仍是混濛的，或是抱着厭戰的觀念的，然而，他們旣然和我們是同國，同種，和同一個世界上的人。那他們在這個和平的抗戰上，就仍然有他們的價値，所以急切需要人來說服他們。如果一遇着有機會，我們可以毫不客氣地負起這種責任。但是我們就永遠地等着機　呢？絕不，在于時，可以在書信要和朋友們談到，但是更有效力的辦法，就是當面討論。而現在的這寒假，不正是我們舉行個別談詁的好時候嗎？有人有一種錯誤的觀念，以爲這樣費時間的小事，是不値得去做的，那他是輕視了這個別談詁的價値，這樣的談話，最先就使人有一種親切之感，而不令他先對你有一個壞的成見，他愈不當你是在宣傳，你宣傳的效果就愈大，對於不認識的人，還不怎樣，如果對手是個朋友，甲坦率的友情去鼓舞他，用眞實的理論去打動他，這效果不是能想　的，而且如果是克服了，並目訓練好了一個知識階級，這個價値不是更大嗎？</p>
<p>諸如此類的個人的工作，是隨時隨地都可以施行的。</p>
<p>至於團體的活動，那無論在形式或內容上範圍都來得廣人些，在短短的一個星期的寒假之中，很不容易有許多的工作，這在事先定計劃時就該注意到，只求其質之優，不求其　之豐，不必把工作安排得太多，而使得工作大綱只成了不兌現的「空頭支票」。</p>
<p>如果原來在學校要是有著什麽組織，最好不要讓它隨着學期的終了，而停止了生命，讓它繼續生存在同學們的身上，這樣，旣省去了我們另外組織的麻煩，又使寒假的工作與學期中工作有了連真性，一直繼續到第二學期裏面去，這樣不但可以使我們連最短的時間也不停頓，就是在整個的學生運動和救亡運動上，它的意義也是較大的。</p>
<p>但是，如果原來在學校中是沒有組織的，我們現在就不得不按照我們的能力和興趣組織一個團體，致力於一樣或兩樣救亡的工作。雖然暫時在組織期間，我們有一個小小的停頓，但是我們可以把它的生命延長到下學期裏面去，並且延長到永遠，直到達了我們最後的目的。在寒假之中，做得多少就是多少。</p>
<p>國家敎養了我們，我們把一切都貢獻國家：我們是中華民族的一員，把一切都貢献找們的民族；我們生存在這世界上，把我們的一切都貢献這世界。這是無可置疑的！</p>
<p>爲了眞正的和乎，爲了我們永遠的生存，要下我們最大的努力和熱誠，不在意一切的困難和打擊，不躭誤一分鐘的時間，向抗戰救亡的前途突進。</p>
<h3>中學生在救亡工作中的本身問題　第二名真光女中黃實珍</h3>
<p>——今年寒假期內應有的檢討和準備</p>
<p>申報此次所舉行的中學生論文競賽，是要在「今年寒假期內中學生的救亡工作問題」的範園內命題，我以爲祇着眼於工作一方面，仍不免陷於「空言」，因爲事實上寒假的時期很短，不管在什麽地方，根本作不出有成績的工作來，甚或纔準備好便已開學，那麽縱使有很豐富圓滿的工作計劃，也不過是一篇好看的文章，於『當前局勢』實難針對得到。縱使退一步晚也有可爲之處，但就一年來的觀　所得，對於救亡工作的成續之進展，實在和抗戰進展的情形不配合，這是爲求得勝利的一個很大的障碍。不配合的原因是什麽？除了客觀的條件不够，單從主觀的條件上說，便是一般的學生本身對工作上就有許多問題。這些問題旣是在工作中發現出來，便當立刻與以糾正。所以在很短的寒　中如果作不出其他的工作來？就應當利用這一個時期作爲反省及改進的機會。實　情形是應當如此，所以此文使也就此命題，就此立論。</p>
<p>我們先要說中學生在抗戰敬亡的陣線上所處的地位是怎樣，然後纔可看出我們的錯誤是如何嚴重，更可知我們所當改進和凖備的是什麽。且讓我們看看中學生在抗戰救亡的陣線上所處的地位是怎樣重要吧：</p>
<p>從全國中學生人數上說，在全　動員中總可發揮一大部分力量。</p>
<p>再從程度（包括知識能力）方面說，可以作啓發一般農工民衆的工作，並爲之領導。</p>
<p>若從體質方面說，又都是　年壯力强的靑年。如直接參加作戰部隊，也是一大批精銳的戰士。</p>
<p>根據以上三點，可知中學生的內在潜伏力是何等强大。這種力量若能充分發展，不僅能加强抗戰救亡的陣線。更可使×人加趣崩潰。而推進我國走上最後勝利的階段。</p>
<p>在過去十八個月的抗戰期中，事實吿訴我們—一部分的中學生曾盡了最大的努力，在戰史上留下不可埋沒的功績。如：直接參加抗戰隊伍，很沽躍地出現於戰場上和游擊區裏，予×人以重大的打擊。有的在受各種訓練之後，隨軍服務，他們不顧生死，出入於槍林彈雨，救護　兵；担任除奸和運輸等工作，配合軍隊作戰。又有的在受擾害較少的後方成立救亡團體，熱烈地從事於宣傳，募捐，勸銷公債，献金，慰勞將士，救濟難民等工作。這些都可證明一部分中學生確也盡了他們的責任，不負國家的敎麥。</p>
<p>但是反過來看，大部分原來處於安全地帶，及從淪陷區遷到安全地帶的中學生又怎樣呢？即以香港一地而論，所表現的大都是：</p>
<p>（一）讀死書，求好的分數，而不關心國家之存亡。這種人以爲拚命讀書，便是盡了學生的本分。</p>
<p>（二）各種救亡組織有名無實，虎頭蛇尾。開會時，熱情奔放，大聲疾呼；滿紙都是工作計劃。最後竟銷聲匿跡。</p>
<p>（三）購債捐欵之後便不問其他的專，以爲這就算盡了國民一分子的責任，彷彿目己出了錢，別人便得去出力，最後勝利就可由自己所出的錢　來的一般。</p>
<p>（四）　作各種慰勞品不切實用，如棉衣太薄，毛織手套太鬆，均不能禦寒，只造成大的數目，在宣傳中動人聽聞。</p>
<p>（五）集中軍訓時，多不能吃苦；有些人竟是　一入營便潜逃回港。</p>
<p>（六）受了環境的刺激還不能克服各種誘惑，仍大批地出人於娛樂場所，或玩戀愛的把戲。</p>
<p>從這些事情上，又可見出任抗戰　　上處重要地位的中學生，所表現的是具有如何嚴重的錯誤。欠自省，欠糾正，欠訓練——之對抗戰的認識仍有不足，缺乏政治上的修養，所以不能京服怠情，　大，茍安的習慣。</p>
<p>我們先已說過寒假旣是很短，多數的學校不過放錯誤是什麼，是與未來工作無補的。知道而不能糾正或再充實，是和不知錯誤所在是一樣的錯誤。所以對本身問題的探討，我認為此勉強作幾天無成績的對人工作尤為重要，並且這的確是救亡工作的一部，也可說是救亡工作的基礎。</p>
<p>那麼究竟我們在這寒假期內應該作些什麼，綫有裨於未來的工作？大致應有以下幾項：</p>
<p>第一，先在校內召集同學舉行檢討會，對過去整個救亡工作作一自我批判。對種種不努力及錯誤的地方，嚴格地指出，並公佈出來，以作改進的根據。這一個組應，以後就改成監察的機關，等開要以後各種救亡工作繼續進行時，便督促其改進，並咸少未來的缺陷。</p>
<p>第二，成立一個座談會，每日用日兩小時衆集，討論國際及國內的各種問題，加　我們對各方面的認識。不要只聽別人講就算，要我們自己利用思考觀察的能力去作分析　判斷。</p>
<p>第三，各校同學可自動在塞假內定三五次，請大家所信仰的人士，演講大家所不瞭解的各項問題，作思想上的指導。</p>
<p>第四，經常地舉行讀書會，參加此會之同學，可自動出資購集學校圖書館所沒有的關於抗戰及其他知識的書籍，卽時分發各人。决定每人在這一假期內至少讀若干本，並規定在相當時期召集開會，討從書上得來的知識。同時更把一般的正確理論與認識，充分地運用釗每一個具體問題上面去。</p>
<p>第五，組織參觀隊或考察隊向各難民營及各救亡機關考察其內部情形，知道所需要的是什麽，並可知道別人的工作大致是怎樣的，以提高自己的工作效能</p>
<p>以上所說的幾件事，是在短期內容易進行的，並且在自己本身方面最易發生效果，在這不過十多天的寒假裏，最切實的工作，我想祇　這些。</p>
<p>就目前的環境而論，眞正對抗戰有貢献的工作，决不是十幾天內可以完成，就算是幹，也不是糊要糊塗的盲幹，　若以爲從　是這　幹，現在也應照樣的幹下去，那便白費了時間和精力，結果都於抗戰的進展無補。我們要知道檢討與改革是了作進行中的重要步驟，也是成功的要素，特別在救亡工作中是處於基礎的地位。短期的塞假，旣是不能盡量發展中學生的能力，那末爲什麽不抓住這機會，努力改正工作上的缺陷，更撤底的把自己充實起來，加緊自我訓練，做個堅實的戰士，再來從事於艱巨的鬭爭？中學生能首先　底解　本身對工作上的問題，所幹的救亡工作綫可有成效，纔有價値的可霄。這一點意思，還望各先進和各同學予以指正。</p>

<h3>氤氳着長沙的祥雲</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>被慷慨地稱爲『只當洗了個火澡』的長沙，該地　然有很多的人民，會意外地具有樣超脫的想像——他們認爲：長沙所處地位，要想在此次抗戰過程中，不被犧牲，不遭毀壞，幾爲不可能的事。這不是說我方實行焦土抗戰，可以隨便拿她犧牲：是說×人殘暴成性到處任意燒殺，對於三湘精華所在的省會，它當然不會將她輕易放過。所以長沙好似註定了的某種命運，雖然不至於會淪爲如上海南京之被×人縱火一炬，但也難免不似桂林貴陽　地之被×機狂炸慘燒，無論如何，是不容易保持其金甌　恙的了。</p>
<p>此外，他們還認爲：如今長沙雖毀，但焦土仍屬我有。古人說得好：『有土此有財。』又說：『江山是人打成的。』今後我們對於這個剛受過委屈洗過「火柴」的長沙，將穿給她一件怎樣時髦的新衣？將把她培養成怎樣健美的人物？這完全操之在我們手上，倒是一點不困難。</p>
<p>另外還有幾則對災民意識的個別測驗，特將其重要片叚摘記出來：</p>
<p>「我們這一帶的房子，要是他們後來不補火，是不會燒得這麽厲害的；何况頭一夜就不曾………」一個姓王的中年災民遭　嘆借地說；但下文却被一個就地擺攤的商人截住：</p>
<p>「那還好說？××銀行有多少鈔票簿據搬不出來，要燒還是燒了！」</p>
<p>「銀行——那是公家的！」</p>
<p>『公家？公家的錢，還是國家的錢！』</p>
<p>「不錯，無論公家私家，多有一點錢，便好和×人多拚一拚！」那個姓王的，若有新悟似的便把話頭兜轉到抗戰中心上來：「本來我對於旣成事實的火災，幷不作無益的追悔，不過我們要痛念這次火災損失之大，大家應咬牙關，竭力想法翻身，能復業的趕快復業，也好努力生產；不能復業的，便趕快組織起來，去帶助抗戰隊伍抬傷兵去！」</p>
<p>當然囑，事實上絕不會有大數量的受傷將士，需要幾千幾萬災民組織担架隊去抬運，不過在老百姓口中，「抬傷兵去」的一句話，不能把它看得太單純，它是滿腔熱血，包括着人民所能做的各部門戰時勞役呢！我們果能因勢利導，加以適當的組訓，不是就多添了一批戰地服務的生力軍麽？</p>
<p>「警察先生！上次大火時，我想你們絕不會如一般所傳：全部撤退吧？」我很客氣地請詢一位站崗警察。</p>
<p>「不？我們是剛從旁的地方調來服務的，大火時情形如何，不敢亂說，但是找們有許多同志，立誓要雪以前不白之寃。來日大難方長，倘再遇着緊急時機我們警察上放出去的每一个崗位，準似栽下深根的鐵樹，開花也開在那裏，死也死在那裏——冉閙上次笑話的，絕不算是父母生長的。」</p>
<p>警察在非常時期的任務，到底是怎樣？似乎要看當時情勢而定，不能刻板地去苛求他們：可是他們能有這番新釘截鐵和自覺的决心，不能不說是大火所授給他們一種可賀的洗體。</p>
<p>從一大圈燒殘了的院落裏，跑出來兩個犬眞無邪的女孩，年約十一二歲，一個追一個的跑，簡直將地上的瓦礫踢得亂響亂飛。迎着她們跑出來的路綫望進院落要去，斜靠着此牆上蓋着兩三間廠棚，院中有石砌花台，有破裂花盆，有焦黑如炭的花木餘燼，光景以前必是講究人家。</p>
<p>「小朋友，你們還這樣的高興麽？你看你們的房子……」</p>
<p>『唔！這個——這有甚麽關係，我們只要前方打勝仗，只要將日本××趕走，那比住『　宮』還好呢……』話沒說完，又跳躍地跑進院落裏去了。</p>
<p>她們竟活潑警覺得似兩隻聰明的小鳥，我恨不能將她們拉住再談幾句；然而『花香不在多』，這幾句已經夠味了。史丹林說過：「靑年與兒童，是我們的希望，是我們的將來。」那末，我們民族解放戰爭前途將怎樣遠大？而正在生長中的新中國將來更要怎機的光明？從這附隻小烏警覺的談吐中，不難想像而獲得其象徵。</p>
<p>又：記者行抵長沙，以及離開時，都在淸晨四點鐘，黑夜裏要　繼轉轉地走了許多街道，量特別的是：從未聽見一聲鷄叫，可是一到東方發白的時候，不論在近處，在遠處，或破壁殘院中？或鄉村古寺要，往往會猛可地吹出響喨的軍號，唱起雄壯的歌聲，把『睡眼惺忪』的整個長沙，一，似乎都震盪了發起抖來！接着，『光明』就站上了『黑暗』的崗位！道又象徵什麽，當然更不難想像了。</p>
<p>湘雅　院主持人西籍醫師顧仁先生及費，韓兩小姐，他們雖是碧眼藍睛人，但非常同情我們的抗戰，每大替我們義務醫治傷兵及貧病，因人手不够，簡直累得他們連吃飯時間都要打折扣，但他們反非常高與，見了人隨時是笑瞇眯呢！</p>
<p>有次田漢先生發表一篇「中國的醫學彩育」的論文大意是說：外國人如顧仁先生及費，赫兩小姐等，還仗義來替我們搶救負傷將士。而我們自己有醫學經騐的醫師和看護小姐們反遠走高飛，自問良心能昧得下去麼？</p>
<p>顧仁先生見了這篇論文，便樂不支頤地對人說：「習醫的本旨，原在濟世救人。我和費，赫兩小姐，服務中國社會，有好多年了，今値中國爲世界和平，人類正義及民族解放而向日本法西斯抗戰，我們當然更要竭力協助，以　貫澈我們的初衷。不過我們抱歉能力薄弱，未能廣　救濟；猶承時論獎飾，那里敢當！」沒隔了幾天，該院又增關病室一間，並添請醫帥一位及護士四人。</p>
<p>——綜觀上述畏沙刦後的各種事象，以及二般市民的談話心理，表面上雖則東鱗西爪，互不關聯，但在精神方面，他們却有一個共同的意識形態，就是大家一致要從支持長明抗戰爭取最後勝和中，去向日法西斯追償長沙火災所有損失犧牲之代價！而且最後勝利必屬于我的象徵，雲蒸需蔚，層出不窮，已顯將焦土上空氤氳成一朶鮮　的祥靈了！</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>逆流的力量</h3>
<p>黎明前的黑暗，也許是更可怕的。時代的怒潮中，也必然會發現汹湧的逆流。最近國際時事發展，也顯現了逆流，這些逆流由×××××對侵略國家的妥協政策開始，而有最近英法政府之承認西叛軍佛朗哥政府，美國之關島設防案竟遭否决，可謂爲最驚人之逆流而，我們的×人漢好親日反共主和份子，又　口這種逆流，來詆毀和平陣綫，詆毀爲和平奮鬥的　聯，詆毀我國廿個月英勇抗戰的成績，同時誇大法西斯侵略者力量的偉大，於是結論到我們必須在這種力量下面屈服，我們必須屈服在黑暗勢力和逆流之下！</p>
<p>然而×人漢奸新日反共和和份子的這種活動是毫無根據的，第一是因爲在當前反法西斯的鬥爭中，固然出現了許多逆流，然而這　逆流的力量實屬有限，實可戰勝，譬如英法統治者承認西叛軍政府一舉，巳經引起與發展全英正義人士反參安協運動的高潮，這幾天英法人民不斷舉行不威遊行，英國工黨的强劾政府案雖於廿八日以三四四票對一三七票否决，而反對者一三七票的力量，在將來正是不可忽視的力量。此外昨日（三月一日），倫敦舉行抵制日貨運動大會，援華標語汽球飛遍上空、足見廣大强壯的力量，亦正隨政治逆流而有加倍的發展！次之如美參院否决關島防案，現已引起全國人民的反對，即陸海軍當局亦一致認定此舉大足降低美國在太平洋上之地位，足以造成帮助日×擴大世界戰爭的罪惡。此外如美衆院之否决美國限制購銀案，摩根韜之力主予政府以非常權力，均可見美國人民反法西斯侵略力量的高漲，亦可見反對派孤立派之企圖的違反公意，及其前途之終將失敗。</p>
<p>第二，×人漢奸親日反共主和份子對於蘇聯和平政策對於我國持久抗戰對於民主和平陣綫的攻擊，亦是毫無根據的。首先是蘇聯國內力量正在發展，第三次五年計劃將於本月十日聯共十八次大會中作重要决定，以保證蘇聯國防力量人民生活的進步。次之，我國抗戰形勢直向「×我勢均力×」的形勢邁進、新軍正在不斷成長，國際援助亦隨日×之新的冒險，而有鉅大的進步，國共親密合作更爲一鉅大保障。至於主和陣綫內少數國家統治者雖爲本階級一時利益不顧國家與世界而有逆流倒瀉的傾向，但其所代表的勢力少數金融資本家，實力並不足重視，同時日益發展中的人民陣綫運動，更爲反動勢力發展的重大阻礙。</p>
<p>讓我們在黎明前的黑暗中警醒起來吧！讓我們在時代逆流前振奮起來吧！我們的隊伍將是廣大强壯！</p>

<h3>塔布衣夫人發表　納粹政府的暗潮</h3>
<p>— 黃平譯</p>
<p>—戈培爾被毆的內幕—</p>
<p>大家都該還記得，在不久以前，有一個消息，說德國宣傳部長戈培爾，爲了調情而被人毆傷，後來又有一個不同的消息，說戈培爾的被毆，並不是眞爲了調情，而是納粹政府官員爭權奪利暗鬥的結果，但當時並無譯　眞象發表。最近，法國名記者塔布衣夫人，她是專門研究歐洲政情的。在「公証人」週報上，發表了一篇文章，揭破了納粹政府官員暗鬥的眞象，她雖不說明這便是戈培爾被毆的眞原因；但明眼人是一目了然的。</p>
<p>下面僅是她那篇文章的摘譯——譯者。</p>
<p>希特勒雖然是一個多管閒事的人，但，對于人家的私事，他却向來不大高興過問。過去許多次的淸黨事件中，雖然常常見到「人格掃地」與「行爲不檢」的罪狀，但，那不過是說說罷了；一切自有其政治的原因。</p>
<p>可是，現在却有着例外了：希特勒對他的宣傳部畏戈培爾傳士的私生活，表示不滿起來，他認爲戈培爾的享受太奢侈，不能跟其他的納粹頭腦們同嘗甘苦。依照希特勒的意見，人生於世，只有一個目標：爲納粹主義工作，鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已。</p>
<p>其他的納粹頭腦們——除了外長里賓特羅甫，他是希特勒所特准例外的——都是自奉甚儉。他們從不多吃一頓豐盛的餐肴一，從不尋找超出規定的娛樂；他們一天到晚所忙的，只是他們的工作。</p>
<p>戈培爾便不同了，他的生活的確異常奢侈：吃的是佳肴美酒；住的是華麗公寓，傭僕成群，汽車多輛；這一切都是希特勒所看不慣的。</p>
<p>在最近一次慶祝國社黨成立紀念大會上，希特勒追述國社黨過去的麗功偉績之餘。又對全體納粹政府的頭腦一一誇獎一番。只有一個人不曾提到，那便是戈培爾。</p>
<p>以後不久，希特勒突然又組織了一個「報紙煽動部」，專門負資研究和對付外國報紙攻擊德國的工作。這新組織却不隸屬於宣傳部長戈培爾，而由希特勒副手赫斯直接統制。一切方針都聽希特勒親自訓令，而由戈培爾，秘密警察長亨密勒及外長里賓特羅甫三人的代表共同辦理。</p>
<p>這新組織的目的，無疑的是在企圖加强德國的宣傳工作，希望在宣傳部，秘密警察部及外交部三方面合作及元首和副手的主持之下，獲得點較好的宣傳成績。</p>
<p>新組織成立之後，第一個受影響的，自然是戈培爾，他不但在宣傳工作上丟了臉，卽在一般的地位上，也大大減低。</p>
<p>戈培爾的如此倒運，幷不是　然的，而是他不久以前和秘密警察長亨密勒閙翻的結果。</p>
<p>在德國，大家都知道，戈培爾和亨密勒　來有點勢不兩立，兩人都僱了許多間謀，在國內及國外活動。最近兩年間，亨密勒用各種方法，把戈爾培的許多間謀，都召進了秘密警察隊。這樣一來，戈爾培對那些名義上是他手下問諜的人們，竟鞭長英及，無法指揮了。</p>
<p>亨密勒佔了這個上風，還不甘心。最近他突然又對戈培爾大肆攻擊。他說，據他自外國得來的情報，証明戈培爾的宣傳政策，完全錯誤。他認爲，有許多話是只能暗地下跟納粹人員講的，戈培爾都不管三七二十一的宣到國外去了。他斥戈培爾太歡喜說話。</p>
<p>這一次，戈培爾又忍不住了，便翻起臉來，說明他的宣傳工作完全依據元首的指示，用不着他人來多嘴。於是，兩人愈加水火，成爲死仇。</p>
<p>戈培爾的確是個高明的宣傳人才，在德國，在世界，都算磚上第一流的，但幹起秘密工作來，他却全不是亨密勒的對手。而況且，他們兩人把對方平生的許多私人劣蹟，都知道得很淸楚。戈培爾還不好意思下他的宣傳工夫，亨密助却不客氣地，把戈培爾的私事全宣揚出來。所以不久以前，戈培爾的謠言閙得烏烟瘴氣。弄得頗有身敗名裂的樣子。</p>
<p>這事情希特勒也知道了。他原對戈培爾的奢侈生活不很滿意，這樣一來，自然更不如意了。不過，戈培爾在德國，也算只比戈林差一點的頭號角色，希特勒也不得不手下留情，有所顧忌。</p>
<p>於是，希特勒攷慮的結果，便用了前面的方法，使戈培爾難堪了一下。</p>
<p>戈培爾受了這處分之後，的確很不高與。所以，前些時候，德國忙着的反美蓮動，他却不出來領導，表示消極。後來由戈林，赫斯及里賓特羅甫的多方勸慰，他才答應了重整旗鼓。幷且，誇出了海口，說唯有他，才能煽動得德國人民去參加反資本主義的戰爭。</p>
<p>糾紛雖算是吿一段落了但納粹人員的暗鬥，永遠是存在的。前仇未解，戈培爾吃了亨密勒這一次虧，日後總是要報復的。大空等着瞧吧。</p>

<h3>本報論文賽給獎禮</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>從陌生到新交</p>
<p>靑年人沒有開會不準時的壞習慣，昨天下午還不到二時的時候，本報所熱烈歡迎的靑年朋友就陸陸續續地到勝斯酒店二樓一間精美的廳堂集攏起來了。</p>
<p>本報中學生論文賽取錄二十五人的姓名。在我們手上不知溜過了多少次，在我們的眼簾不知映了多少回，但是，儀容丰彩究竟怎樣呢？這個有趣的想像，直到昨天才活生生地捉住着。在友誼的　　中，這是神秘的　　　段。</p>
<p>優秀的一群</p>
<p>啊！原來你是而瘦的，你是矮而胖的，你的學生裝，道地是學牛的風格，你的西裝亦煞像香港學生的派頭；用功吧，你巳經掛起近視眼鏡了；逃難的生活所磨折吧，你靑　的而龐，已經刻下了風霜的痕跡啊！可惜記者不能　這優秀的一羣詳細開話匣，只有　用僅有的短促時間每一位略叙個寒喧而已。</p>
<p>第一名的張，璉君是江蘇人，從前在上海光中學讀書。父親到南方做事，年前才進入知用中學高中肄業。個子相當健美，看來是老成持重的樣字。冠軍，在全場中自然是最引人注意的一僩</p>
<p>第二名的黃寶珍女土，戴着眼鏡頗有學者的風度。全塲所有四位女性都是她們眞光　中的同學。和廣州人學附中六位同學互相媲美着。他們二校　團體成績都是較爲不凡。二校亦都是逃　的學校。</p>
<p>第三名的朱星華君是南洋的華僑，到香港已經三年了。說的是一口流利的國語。西裝翩翩，可是，在簡短的白談話間亦覺察出是有「靈魂」的醫覺靑年。</p>
<p>歐陽廉，徐汝賢，劉世植諸君，却是香港的老學生。魏北南君來自汕頭，　菲君來自台山，陳炯朝君來自廣州，關眞如君來自開平，莫煜樂君來自東莞。這幾位同學到了香港來讀書都不過是一年半戰的事情。</p>
<p>此外還有尹松平，鄭水成，伍伯山，陸景衛，何焯榴，黃淑暖，黃鈁高聲賜，陳鑑琪，黃瀛源，温功禮，諸君却沒有時間長談。出席同學共二十二人，還有三人因事未克參加。本報參加同仁共十多位，濟濟一堂，充溢着靑春的快慰。</p>
<p>開會與勗勉</p>
<p>開會了，首先由　步陶先生致詞：「報紙是社會敎育的一種，本報本着一貫的歷史精神，對于努力文化運動不遺餘力。這次本　舉行中學生論文賽，承各位踴躍參加，　我們非常感　。盼以後仍站在一起，爲國家，爲文化而繼續努力……」</p>
<p>陸浮先生報吿這次徵文和評判的經過之後，就是吳景松先主演講：「…在杳港可以看得出注　體育的競技而忽視腦力的訓練與競賽。體育但我們中國是應該提倡的；但是文化連動亦絕對不能　視。因爲文化是民挨生存的某礎。在抗戰期問不但要保存子文化，而且要提高文化，發揚現階段的鬥爭文化。我們處在香港這個特地域，應該好好播下一些種子。靑年與婦女在此較易開展工作，盼諸位好好努力，除使在本地發生作用外，還要使工作，精神。與國內及國外，發生聯系，多一分努力，就多一分收獲」</p>
<p>這是多　中肯的一番講話。</p>
<p>潘期先生亦像吳先生一樣，臂頭先抱歉，不會說廣州話，然後才發揮了宏論：『從徵文中得到三個証明：第一是証明香港靑年學生認識很正確，思想很前進；第二是証明香港肯年學生文化程度多數是在水凖以上；第三是証明香港的女子有思想的，前進的亦不少，經此我們才知道一舷人對于香港的學生非難是有所悞解與有所儡視。</p>
<p>『在文卷中發覺很多人對于學校與敎師表示不滿，這一點特別要希望諸位體諒學校當局在此環境下的苦衷。不必操之太切，形成帥生對立的惡劣現象。最好是學生自身有了團結，善意地向學校當局發表意見，帮忙學校發展……』</p>
<p>潘先生用進步的事實來慰勉香港的青年年學生，還語　心長地希望師生打成一片，這自是動人心坎的一番講話。</p>
<p>陸　先生報吿徵文經過之後，再將剛才幾位先生的意見，把大意翻譯！遍。還滔滔地針對着香港的環境，又來一番誠懇而切實的希望：</p>
<p>『香港難然有人在荒淫與無恥，我們却應該嚴肅地工作。後方與　方是名樣重要，留一部份工作者在香浩工作亦是必要的。我們要認　和利用這個特殊環境，爭取中英親善來擴大國際宣傳。自身方面要加强自我敎育，從民族人類的歷史遺　中，從救亡的實際工作中提供理論的收作爲救亡行動的指　。我們要不斷地研究，工作，實踐把止確的救亡理論運用到實際工作去。過去風頭主義形式主主的作風特別要克服過來……』</p>
<p>本報的幾位先生說得多了，難得有來賓楊國華先生在熱烈掌聲之下以「在此醉生夢死的環境中，居然有了報界與靑年學生携手前進的新局面」提出來自勉與共勵。</p>
<p>綸　冠軍張大璉君演講的時候，嚴肅的空氣中又是緊張起來，温暖起來。『我們非常感謝申報對我們的好意，還誠懇希望申報領導我們這一羣……』。</p>
<p>從容而誠意的一番說話在大家視線集中之下，結東着。熱烈的掌聲衝破了周週的靜寂。</p>
<p>可惜的是這一鞏青年朋友還有點孩子氣似的怕羞，心裏想要說的話還不敢說了出來。</p>
<p>領了獎品，在成功的坦途開步</p>
<p>茶話開始，大家談笑起來。攝影紀念願我們精神永在一起。至於獎賞第二二三名的銀鼎和銀杯只是物質上的略表敬意而已。全體二十五名　獎本報半年，普遍的獎品使我們內心平安一些。對干靑年朋友的精神食糧，我們亦寄予無限的祈望。</p>
<p>諸位靑年朋友們：你是中藥民族最優秀的子孫，你在寫作上發生了興趣。在讀書方面有了好習憤，你就把握着成功的重要條件。你要堅定　個自信力遇進，新中國在盼望挺進的優秀子孫生長起來啊！就　祝謹領了獎品，在成功的坦途開步！</p>

<p>在　符炮竹的元旦底翌晨、矾曉的時　、我們坐上了廣九列車、這時、灰黯的天空還勝朧地殘星與礫、</p>
<p>司行的是大同了友的慰勞團、筆者爲工作和機會的關係、和他們合夥起來、大家的目的地都是到坪山惠寶人民抗×游擊隊去的、車抵大地坳時始與開往沙魚涌的「大　」綸年暇停止、祇得步行到大地墟早點後冉乘車往深圳去、再由深圳乘長途公路汽車向種崗　發、旅客　擁非常、但祇坐了五十分鐘的汽車就要開始步行了、因以後的公路都　破壞了、不過沿途所見　祇是焚毀了短小孫　、×人稍加修　仍可　車、可見破壞　不够澈底、</p>
<p>經崗邊、崗背而達龍與是已十二時半、龍　爲一大市鎭、去年十月初旬被×人蹂躪、焚燒甚慘、危樓殘互、令人悲憤、但居民巳漸次歸來、惜仍覺冷寂非常、</p>
<p>自龍崗至坪山仍需步行四小時、人本來很疲餓了、但仍奮勇前行、中有女工數人和一女敎員亦很健步、頗爲難得、</p>
<p>所終很多地方都曾給×人進佔過的、刦後原氣未復、而再度進擾東江的謠言復熾、局面很緊張、內此除軍事嚴加防　外、公路的破瓖比前段做得好、柏距間掘了許多陷阱、或方或長、如×人鐵甲軍或馬隊進政、將予打擊、</p>
<p>在黃昏晚風曳麥浪中、疲憊的步子開始踏進坪山游擊區去、這是一個遠距淡水很近的頗大市　、街道還淸潔、居民郎忙于度年、故仍冷靜非常、最先引人注意的是巾得滿壁的標語、都是惠寶人民游擊隊和坪山抗敵同志會等發的、呌人與奮極了</p>
<p>極度的疲　給高度的高興情緒趕跑啦、我們踏進了游擊區、</p>
<p>他們是保衛東江的戰鬥員</p>
<p>惠寶人民游擊隊預知我們的來臨，因此列隊相迎于鬥、</p>
<p>立正政赦、我首先到純模而嚴肅的武裝游擊戰士底英姿了、不覺地報以莊嚴的微　、我們先到的這地原是坪山學校、現爲第二隊部的　訓所、敞莊雄偉、淸幽得很、</p>
<p>惠寶人民游擊隊的產生到現在還不達三個月、可是這一枝在東江享有盛　的活耀的隊伍、就是在這短短期間生存着、前衝着、而成爲目前一個後秀的進步的游擊隊伍、</p>
<p>去年十月初旬×人開始進攻廣東向澳頭淡水坪山等地方侵略、而廣大民衆在惠靑工作團領導之下發動了單紳的武裝抗戰、經過一個不斷的鬥爭的時期、他們產生了惠寶人民抗×游擊隊的雛形、但那時人數不過數十、而槍枝也不過借　叔海旅借到十餘枝和奪獲×人的台起來而已、但更大的鬥爭增進着、這到現在祇是三月左右、人數幼飛突到數百人、槍枝數百條、幷有重機關、輕機關和手機關了、</p>
<p>道　迅速的發展是　　的發現着忠實人民游擊隊是在鬥爭中生長和發展的、一也顯示我們抗戰是在進步着、</p>
<p>由干他們的行動護得廣　民衆底信仰和擁護、進而得到友軍的信任和合作、更經政府正式准予成立、于是他的發展更浩大了、而本身的糾織也健全地長成着、</p>
<p>在目　的政治和軍事形勢而言、任何人都不否認×人是會有再度擾佔東江的可能、因此保衛東江的行動應當是急迫的、怎樣把民衆眞正的力量動員起來在軍民合作之下從事抗戰、是急亟非常的、惠寶人民游擊隊在目前是向着這個之目標下進行的、同時、他們要是保衛東江的戰鬥員、</p>
<p>在編制上他們仍是採甩陸軍的三三制、現分三隊、每大隊　三中隊、每中隊設三小隊的、另設一特務大隊、工作是負有機關槍連及政洽幹部等、爲遞應實際環境需要、最近又設立一女子隊、人歡廿餘人左右、</p>
<p>到目前爲止、他們仍半獨立式的、因此軍火及生活上的給養都靠南洋僑胞和海員不斷接濟現在經常有各社團各工友組織慰勞團去慰勞他們的、　（未完）</p>

<h3>愛茄倍根為木偶卻利保壽險　—保險額是五千美金—</h3>
<p>十八年前、有一方很普通、一點也不出奇的密欵根松木、在支加岢的一位木刻家第多爾麥克（Theodore　Mack）的藝術手腕之下、刻成了一個頑皮小孩的頭臉出來、刻得那樣的活潑生動、而在十八年後的今日、這方木頭就成了世界上最値錢的一塊、不折不相的、頂少也値五千美金！這就是著名木偶人却利麥加　、他眞是個幸運的「木頭」、非但空前、敢說絕後、絕對沒有第二方木頭能和他一樣、因爲他是眞正老牌，嚴禁影射的、</p>
<p>可是最近愛茄倍根——卻利的負責人——卻已經花了好幾千塊錢、勢力的想另造一個一模一樣的卻利出來、愛茄倍根沒有一點要遺棄却利的意思、相反的、正是一片愛護却利的心腸、替他找一個替身出來、代替他在危險的場面中出演而已、他遍訪全美最好的木刻家、却沒有一個作品能令他滿意、甚至於他用石膏替卻利範下了一個頭部模型下來再刻、結果也是失敗，</p>
<p>「我也說不出那些新臉型的缺點究竟在什麼地方、它們是像透了卻利、連最微細的部份也像、然而它們究竟不是卻利、為什麼櫬端相像的第二隻面孔就不能代表同樣的個件呢、……可借　多爾麥克好幾年前就死了、換句話說、縱使他還活着、恐怕也未見能夠把他的傑作重新再造一个呢、</p>
<p>目前倍根自然還不需要第二個卻利、可是卻利在新片You　Cheat　An　Honest　Man在要演八小時裏的戲、而和他合演的愛惡作劇的W·C·費爾滋又老是　不講理的住位卻利大打其架、這些眞使倍根痛心之極了、萬一他的小朋友出點亂子妮？替身旣然雖覓、祇有消極的替卻利保壽險了、磋商結果、保險公司已經答應投保五千美金、而照倍根的意思、他願意能在一張五萬美金的保險單上簽字呢、</p>

<h3>宋雅海尼　Sonja　Henle</h3>
<p>宋雅海尼、她被麻煩討厭極了、每次溜冰表演後、總有些人候在後台門外釘着　要請她去吃飯、現在她也有了却敵妙計了、遇上這種時候、地說、「好罷、只要你能請我們全班人馬、我是狠願意去的」、這一着妙棋、往往使那些自命風流的傢伙退避三金了、</p>
<h3>佛特烈馬區　Fredrfc　March</h3>
<p>佛特烈馬區最近在拍他的新Trade　Winds的時候、忽然發見了一件他所深思不解的事、他注意到那些日本人的衣服、寬袍大袖、男女都是一梯的、於是他問旁邊的一個日本人、</p>
<p>「喂、當你們的都是這們一樣衣服的時候、怎樣分別男女呀、」</p>
<p>「是嗎」、這個日本人微笑了一下、「讓我　問你一個同樣的問題、當你們好紫　的男人和女人都同樣地剪短頭髮、穿着長脚褲的時候、你們又是怎樣區別男女的呢、」</p>
<p>這位大明星想了一想、終於囘答了、而且很妙、「極簡單的、祇要看那些帶着手袋的、就是女人了、」</p>
<p>卻爾斯別克福　Charles　Blckford</p>
<p>却爾斯別克福、這位一向伯蠻影片之類的粗綫條漢子、演技棄以粗魯兄長的、近來忽然軟化起來了、這次他撕毀了一張二萬元的合同、而跟大導演西席地密爾鬧翻、原因是他拒絕在Unlon　Paciffc裏伯一個極危險的鏡頭、他說、「某一次在一張環球影片裏、我讓一頭　子咬了一口，結果是在醫院裏躺了了六個多月、又有一次腿上足足有一磅重的一塊肉斷送在鯉魚嘴裏、這還　得了嗎、這次又要我嘴裏含上一枝雪茄、而讓阿金泰密洛天用一根二十五尺長的鞭子一下子擊落、算了罷、爲了兩萬塊錢而送掉一隻眼睛、或是一們耳朶或鼻子、究竟合算不來的」、</p>
<h3>約翰韋斯摩勒　Johnny　Weissmuller</h3>
<p>的翰韋斯摩勒、在兩年休假之後重囘好萊塢、幾乎夫掉重演人猿泰山的機會、事淸是這樣、有一天、他試作那舉世聞名的泰山吼聲時、收昔機所能收到的祇是一個極尖銳的高音、並不十分響、公司裏黨然不滿意了、他本人說；並不是和羅潑凡麗茲離婚刺激所致、不過是缺少上樹練習的機會而已、而自、信在短時期內、以往嚴種雄牡的吼聲還是能復原的、</p>
<h3>亞瑟屈里卻　Arthur　Treacher</h3>
<p>這位影星和愛德華霍登一樣的、在銀幕上以演管家見長、看過『巧女歌聲』沒有？那個跟看赫拔馬歇爾的高个子、就趁他、我們或許以爲他長得難看、而他却一向以此自豪、自以爲目前電影演員中沒有比他更高的了、這次他却遇到個硬對頭，好萊塢來了一位英國人里　白萊姆（Lfonel　Brahm）身長穴尺五寸、體重二白八十磅、胸圍五十寸十足、一下子就把骨瘦如柴的亞瑟比了下去、可是過了幾天、他的話又來：「好龍、無論如河、我的身材總是和林肯總統一模一樣的、</p>
<h3>詹姆史蒂華　James　Stewarl</h3>
<p>影迷們將在新片Lce　Follfcs　Of　1939看到這位明星的新把戲了、片中他原是一个溜冰專家、一次折斷了腿、祇能做些輕而易舉的滑稽表演了、這裏他和劉易里斯兩個合扮一匹「溜冰的馬」、劉易里斯當馬頭、而剩下來的部份就是他、</p>
<h3>賈克奧凱　Jack　Oakie</h3>
<p>他大概在什麼地方發了一筆大財囘來了，有人看見他在某處公共塲所簽了張美金百元的支票、毫不經意的用來點燃雪茄呢、</p>
<h3>賈克海萊　Jack　Haley</h3>
<p>賈克海萊非但是個銀幕上的着名　角、同時還是位大慈善家、他常捐助很可觀的欵子給某孤兒院、而這一次、他損贈了院內音樂班的全套制服不算外、還替他們配置了很多原來所缺少的樂器、</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波克　Shirley　Temple</h3>
<p>二十世紀福斯公司攝影塲上添置了計時鐘了、這件事曾使秀蘭鄧波克很煩惱了一陣子、當這位小明星着見那些和她在同一片中工作的孩子們、走出走準都要去打鐘的時候、她哭閙起來了、爲什麽別人都打鐘玩、而目己沒得打呢？場內的職員無論怎樣的給她解釋、因爲她是週薪千元以上的紅星、可以用不着受領卡片打鐘記時的限制了、可是這都、能使她釋然於懷、　總當它是件很快活的妙樂、末了、沒有法子、爲有滿足她小心裏的願望起見、公司裏另置了一架給她、讓她獨自個兒愛打多久就打多久、</p>

<h3>三級跳訓練的討論（續）</h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>（四）HO　單足跳，STEP跨跳，JVMP雙足跳的注意</p>
<p>（一）HOP、開此的時侯、身體應保持跑時的姿態、起跳時脚跟亦着地、唯離地則較足爲先、另一膝高舉以使頭部自然向前、足離地時、身體及臂當保持跑時之動作、兩足相離不可太遠、頭切勿向後垂、右足仍在左膝後、至起跳力將盡時、再舉左膝、以使左腿轉至前面、唯左足仍在左膝之後、否則落地時、左足直下難免致　、右足自然下伸、膝仍略屈、臂前伸以保持平衡、左膝極官提高、左足落地時、身　仍略向前、右足在後舉起、身體保持平衡、</p>
<p>（二）Step、跨跳時、不宜過高、約爲單足跳之三分一、于單足跳時、當極力增加遠度、而將餘勢用于跨步上、再注全力于最後之一跳、其比例大約爲九——八——十尺左右、此時右腿先離地、左膝微屈、上體別屈、右腿努力前跨、左膝切不可高舉、身體極宜平衡、于右膝在跨步最高時、右大腿應與地平行、左足在後、亦不宜高舉爲佳、右足跟先着地、身前屈以使前進之力、增　、得以繼續努力于跳遠</p>
<p>（三）Jnmp左腿與地並行時、不可高舉、才是由致身體不能平衡或後傾　毛病、遂使其遠度減少至十二或十三米左右、若在平日能注意這點、使到沒有後傾的毛病等發生、我相信總可以得到較優良的成續，所以、三級跳與眺遠也有同樣的對于這個問題是很申要、將落沙池時的兩足、應如圖一、兩足伸前、兩手在後以保待平衡、至足洛沙池時的上體、應如圖二、兩手同前上揮腰腹亦同時用力將上體衝前、以免後傾、</p>
<p>總括的說、三級跳的訓練、第一步就要注意跑時的速度、第二方面、要注意到起跑至落沙池時的連續動作——在這兩　內、是不斷的運動、不能有稍可的停頓、更要以基本操爲補助、使到力的增加、姿勢正確的養成爲出發點、（完）</p>
<h3>為什麼運動能增進健康</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>一般人都知道運動能增進健康、且並不知道爲什麽運動能增進健康、各種運動的弊害、進步遲慢、以及對于運動錯誤的觀念多數也就是這個緣故、</p>
<p>欲了解爲什麽運動能增進健康、首先要明瞭健康的眞義、康並不祇是指「無病無痛」而言、尚含有一種「美」和「力」的意義、</p>
<p>在肉體方面運動的功效不外下列三種：——</p>
<p>（一）鍛鍊內臟——欲使內臟强健、最重要的是促進代謝作用、使循環、呼吸和消化三系統的作甩正常而活躍、謝作用與循環、呼吸、消化三系統有相互的關係。如呼吸、或循環或消化系統衰弱、其他各系統與代謝作用必隨若失常、</p>
<p>運動時身體各系統中受影響最大的也就是這三個系統、我們都知道肺臟吸收了空氣中的氣〇之後、再由循環系統把氣輸送至身體各部、身體一運動的組織就利用〇氣來「燃燒」那些能產生能力的「物質」在這個過程中、也有廢物產生、二〇化炭就是其中的一種、血液循環一方面把〇氣輸送至運動的組織或肌肉、一方面也把二〇化炭輸送至肺臟、再由肺臟將其排出體外、</p>
<p>當肌肉運動時、最先產生的現象就是血液中二〇化炭的增加、在腦部有一小部份對於身體的化學變化有最　敏的感覺一、尢其是血液成份的化舉變化。當血液中含有大量的二　化炭時這個靈敏的部份遂起一種反應、　　出一種特殊的神經刺戟、這種刺戟能達到心肺兩部、也使整個身體產生各種適要運動的程序）</p>
<p>在運動的時候、因為一方面要排出二〇化炭、一方面也要把大量的〇氣供給運動的肌肉、於是所需要的　氣、校平時多八倍、心臟亦如是、平時心臟　分鐘的輪出一加會的血液、在運動的時候、腐部控制中樞的經刺就心臟、使通過心臟的血液增加、血液循環的速度也能較平時快八倍、</p>
<p>爲了適應這種需要、心臟一方面加速工作、脈搏由一分鐘七十五次增至一百五十次之多、另一方面心臟也暫時的擴張、增加所輸出的血液、同時心臟肌肉的作用也要有强大的彈性、心臟肌肉的伸展愈大、輸送血液的能力也愈大、單靠心臟的擴張和心跳加連仍不足以供應運動時的需要</p>
<p>在運動的時候最活躍或工作最劇烈的部份應得到最多的血液供給、消化系系統在運動的時候離不很活躍、血液的供給也就減少、但是在運動之後、消化系統不僅能恢復某應有的血液供給、並能使消化機能加速、盡量呼吸食物的營養、</p>
<p>運動也能增進血管的作用、因爲在運動的時候、活躍和工作劇烈的組織和肌肉應得到大量的血液供給、於是該部血管橫張、以備輸送大量的血液、至於不活躍的部份、如消化器官等、祗能得到少量的血液供給、於是該部血管收縮、這種血管的擴張和收縮能使循環系統的作用正常和活躍、　（一）　（以〇代氧）</p>

<h3>論電影歌曲</h3>
<p>— 寒波</p>
<p>電影歌曲在中國僅祇有短短數年的歷史，但她所拾予社會的影廖却已是無比的廣大了。</p>
<p>電影歌曲代替了舞蹈歌曲在民間地位是一個最顯着的收穫。</p>
<p>我們今日在街頭學校或機關團體中所能聽到的歌聲，不再是以前那些「毛毛雨」「桃花江」一類的曲子，而純是由有聲電影中穿挿產生的銀幕歌曲了；在唱片公司的銷路統計表中，舞蹈歌曲的片子也遠不及影曲片子來得多，人們不但嗜好了歌詠電影歌曲，而且更歡喜聽她的聲譜，甚至一般歌舞團，也大　捨棄業已落伍的舊舞曲，另以電影歌曲充作表演脚本，舞廳播昔台等更是電彩歌曲的大本營，這許多事實部顯示着近年來電影歌曲在中國社會中地位的卓越，和影響深巨。因此，我們也就對目前的電影歌曲付予極大的期望。</p>
<p>因爲電影歌曲不但反映了一般的社會狀况。且又足以改變各個人的情神思想，音樂固然足以陶冶人，但也得要看有她是好的音樂，還是懷的？雷影歌曲陶冶了個人，又從千萬個人中去反映一個社會的生活意識。她的重要也于此可見。多謝　耳先生替我們奠定了電影歌曲的基礎，（也是整個樂壇的基礎），遺下了無數支優秀的歌曲，承受他藝術還產的人　努力得極有成續，使電影歌曲界露出萬丈的光芒，不過自從滬港電影界採取大量　製落伍的影片計劃以後，這個光芒就被　壹羣人掩沒了，毒素影片跟不上可進的歌曲，不得來需要沒有時代意味的歌曲來配合他，道些歌曲影響了個人，從而又反映出一個沒有時代象徵的吐會，這麽樣，無意識的影歌就浸入人們心中了。</p>
<p>音樂是文化藝術部門中的一員，他的力量絕下輸于其他任何份子，世間有不認識字的人。但却沒有不會哼曲子的人，以往我們談文化與抗戰，談强化文化陣綫等，大多　側重在寫作一項，忽略了昔樂！尤其是電影歌曲的重要性，這是極應糾正的，我們要求電影歌曲的作家們最低限度要充實影曲的民族意識，要顧慮到影曲的偉大作用，在現境允許的可能範圍內用隱喩，顯示，或激昂偉壯的聲調形式，把握往當前的現實，使能良好感化無量數的個人，陶冶整個的社會於時代前哨，靡靡之音，現在萬萬要不可的了、目前的影曲，並不是在亭子間裏就能產生的，同時還需要主觀的意識，與客觀的環境相配合，影曲的作家不能藐視自己的地位和曲子的重要性。歪扭曲子的內容意識，無異就是可羣衆下毒素，那是絕非我們所期望的。</p>
<h3>西班牙的無名英雄</h3>
<p>— 呂覺良譯</p>
<p>你這無名的英雄啊，</p>
<p>竟消失於西班牙國土之上，</p>
<p>在那鮮血的深谷裏，</p>
<p>你曾忠誠地做過工作，</p>
<p>而英勇地打過勝仗，</p>
<p>那是爲了全體人民的願望。</p>
<p>發起來的紀念啤，</p>
<p>頭上高高頂着寫蒼。</p>
<p>可是如今到處給毀滅統御了</p>
<p>而聽見大炮的聲響；</p>
<p>她會給你題下</p>
<p>無名英雄的字樣。</p>
<p>因了人類的創痛，</p>
<p>而震動了你的心臟，</p>
<p>但爲了自由的獲得</p>
<p>沒有誰人應該驚奇而慌張，</p>
<p>自然地你起來了，</p>
<p>挺身赴難于疆場。</p>
<p>呀，足喪命的槍桿，</p>
<p>向着你鋼鐵般的胸瞠；</p>
<p>無情的子彈教你拾</p>
<p>無助的命運，</p>
<p>那，你便被丟棄在鮮血的深谷萬，</p>
<p>正當爲戰爭而流血的時光。</p>

<h3>猜德國「新書」</h3>
<p>— 王隠</p>
<p>報載海通社訊：德國去年出版新譬，數量居世界第一位，計二五四〇〇冊。</p>
<p>這眞値得我們羨慕，不過也不能不叫我們奇怪的是：德國自從成了希特勒天下以後，只聽見不停地煥書，所毀的書底「數量」倒是「居世界第一位」，怎麽忽然却又這樣大量卽出起書來了呢？</p>
<p>自然，通訊上說得明白：出的是「新書」。燒了舊的，便不能不出新的。不錯，對得很。但我們却忍不住又要問一下：在一年中所出的這樣多的『新書』到底都是些甚麽書呢？</p>
<p>我們雖然住得遠　，但却已經從電報中大概知道了過去德國所燒的書都是些甚麽書。這回出版的『新書』雖然還沒有見說明是那些種類，但我們日猜出一個大概，却也不難。</p>
<p>現在，我且來猜一下，把這二五四〇〇冊的『新書』底種類試給關一個統計表如下：</p>
<p>誇希特勒及國社黨　三〇〇〇〇盼</p>
<p>罵社會主義及蘇聯　五〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>叫婦女回到廚房去　二〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>講奧國卽是德國　三〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>說捷克須受德國保護　三〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>指猶太人都是壞蛋　三〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>論烏克蘭有五十萬日耳曼人四〇〇冊</p>
<p>總數：二五四〇〇冊</p>
<p>我敢說，我這個表一是相當正確的。</p>
<p>但倘是還要問：這些書的讀者底「數量」是怎樣呢？那却就成了難答的問題。不過卻也可以猜出一個大槪。那便是：讀者底「數量」要是和書底「數量」一比較起來時，那現象也一定是「居世界第一位的」。</p>
<h3>山居</h3>
<p>— 唐英偉</p>
<p>跑到南國的孤島之後，過去的山居之總，使我時時　記億着。</p>
<p>大崑崙的雄壯的山峯，高踞俯瞰着全個山城。一個多麽　小的小城啊！誰想到我會在這小城中住了一年之久的時間。</p>
<p>是夏天的季節，田園中長成着油綠的禾苗，勤勞的農民彎着背在陽光下工作着。這是一幅多麽的田園圖啊，當第一步踏進這山城的門檻之後。我便這麼搜頌奢。</p>
<p>把行裝御定之後，便開始展開我的山居生活了。</p>
<p>懷着閑散的心情，常想把這山野踏遍。</p>
<p>晨曦帶來淸脆的山歌聲牛叫聲以及農夫的叱牛聲，這一切聲音，組成一片鄉村的交響藥。在睡夢朦朧中，我微笑着。</p>
<p>離開烏巢似的客居，踏着牛的足跡，向田野間慢步着。</p>
<p>「先生，是從省城來的吧！日本××的飛機沒有再來罷。」</p>
<p>「××的飛機怎麽不來？可是它的炸彈我們並不怕啊！」</p>
<p>在田間工作的婦人望們見我這生客慢慢地走近來，爲了對於時事的關心，不怕陌生的問起話來了，不怕鬼子炸彈的找。爲了生活的關係，也不得　着在生活的鞭子下走向這內地來，但是我的答話是多麽的矛盾啊！</p>
<p>—我們應該說是把文化帶到農村來啊！</p>
<p>想起這話，我覺得文化人到農村來的責任了。可是我第一天與農民們會晤却付出了一張矛盾的空頭支票。</p>
<p>寂靜的山居啊，像一片死水一粟的沉靜。</p>
<p>有時候，我坐在房子裏，偶然的也會懷起孤寂的感冒病。</p>
<p>給這死水投　一塊小石頭吧，也許會振起一囘激動漣漪。</p>
<p>因爲我不是一個會任群衆之前吶喊的人，只好用我的手。我的思想，創造成一幅一幅的圖形，陳列於大衆的眼前，作爲我的代言的工具，—我想：利用山坡荒地，可以增進戰時的農業生產。在這沉靜的農村中，舉行抗戰宣傳的畫展，作爲識字運動的先聲。也並不許算是白費的工作吧！</p>
<p>理想時常不能給人們以現實的兌現，農民們需要安靜的工作，不需要浮動的鬥爭，他們知道××可恨，但他們却不歡喜××不來踐踏他們的鄉材便好——願望在他們是屬於理想的，而在我以他們作爲宣傳的對象上就不免感到農村民衆的抗戰情緒的冷淡了。</p>
<p>失去了靈魂的山城喲！</p>
<p>好　激不起漣漪的死水。</p>
<p>遙遠的北方彌漫着煙硝的烽火，戰士們胃着×人的砲火踏着先烈的血跡前進，而生活在後方的我們一羣，在這死水的氛圍中，只好把鐵般緊張的心情間散下來。拿起士槍，走向山野去吧！練習作游擊虞術。將空中的飛烏作爲×機，枝頭的烏雀作爲×人，包圍，襲擊，俘虜。在暮色蒼茫中，我們唱着游擊隊勝利的歌歸來了。</p>
<p>這樣的幽靜的山居，渡過了我一年沉靜的歲月。</p>
<p>但是，當我離開這山城還不到數個月的時間，×人已進襲到這座土城的門檻來了。轟，轟，巨大的炸彈聲。驚醒了這愛的安靜的一羣。這山域已不是一片死水，而是早己變成狂濤巨浪。</p>
<p>山城裏的農民們終於咆哮起來了。</p>
<h3>楚霸王</h3>
<p>— 李之藝</p>
<p>歷史電影不是史籟的複製，所以在稍稍有些出入的改編是可以，有時而且必要的，但這「可以」或是「必要」，它應該基於新的歷史觀，揚棄地，批判地來連用它，要不然，牛頭不對馬嘴，弄成書蛇添足，畫虎類犬，那才是個笑話。</p>
<p>所以歷史電影（所謂「古裝片」）的困難，它不條是在服裝道具的考証以及場面偉大上，更且是在豐作者的觀點上。這之間不會沒有製作者的主觀，因之也决不能模稜兩可；編新聞的編輯先生該是最「客觀」的了。但是在標題的大小以及地位的顯着上，却還是無法逃避他的善惡和對某項新聞的意識的反映；作爲藝術品的電影，若說是能超然物外，成爲「第三種人」，這能成嗎？</p>
<p>所以對歷史電影的襲作，我們基本態度。倒不是如何忠於史實的問題，而是如何以現在的中國人的立塲，來批判接受歷史的敎訓。</p>
<p>『楚覊王』的刺旨，編導者王次龍先生說得很明白：『因為要使故事合乎現代潮流，就以項羽和劉邦兩個人說，一個主張窮兵讀武，一個主張而仁幾和平，結果是前者失敗而後者勝利，這是『楚覇王』的威劇旨』</p>
<p>『窮兵黷武』和『仁義和平』］這是針對着現在的中國局勢，也針對着現在的世界局勢的，『仁者昌，霸者亡』，這原是不易的至埋，但在『主戰』『主栩』上，我們却還有加以確切的註解的必要，要不然，『主戰』的岳飛成了千秋的罪人，而『主和』的秦槍，則反而成爲萬世的功臣了，際此注精衛之流以出賣祖國爲『和平』的藉口，滿嘴『王道』的東方法西斯蒂者主戰之不得下台，滿冀求和以保贓物的現在，若單單在字面上講什麽「主戰」「主和」實在有成爲侵略者的「尾巴」的危險。想來，本片的製作者的本意，是不會如此的。</p>
<p>所以關於『和』『戰』我們實在還應該進一步的來看它。</p>
<p>東方法西斯萊奢在『膺懲』旣吿失敗。「肅淸」又吿絕望之餘，它在江南所施行的新政策，是懷柔政策，也即是買服人心是也。所謂懷柔政策，拆穿了實在也是不値半分錢的，它一方面嗾使漢奸，在征暴斂，軟詐硬欺，把糧食等等集攏來，然後，由它們出面，把甲地的糧食以一部份運到乙地去一放賑，一儼然是「王者之師」，這樣的鬼把戲，表面上是『仁義和平』之主了，而實際上呢？——反正很少有人會　道這一手鬼把戲的。</p>
<p>而這樣的『仁義和平，』是眞的『仁義和平」嗎？</p>
<p>「楚覇王」是以「仁義和平」者勝利，「窮兵黷武」者失敗來作「劇旨」的，這原是很好：但所遺憾的也正在這裏，它祇是寫了表面，而沒有進一步來作解剖，而這樣是小够的。</p>
<p>我們同情製作者的苦心，我們更心折這樣嚴正的劇旨，同時却也止因爲此時此地，我們更不能不求全責備，以防流弊。——萬一這樣的戲流入到淪陷區去公映，那麽道樣的缺陷更應防止。</p>
<p>關於道點，我想舉出一個例子來談談：</p>
<p>「羽頃進軍咸陽，不聽衆陳，殺秦王子嬰，戮咸陽百姓數萬人」後，銀幕上是有民婦謀進項帳，刺殺覇王一塲戲的，這場戲很重要，那個民婦的話更値得我們注意。她說：「百姓們推倒秦王以後，所希望的是仁義和平之師，那知道霸王一至咸陽，便殺百姓無數，……所以被殺者的家屬，便結爲同盟，打成刺刀，由她進帳來謀行刺，以替被殺戳的百姓們復仇，……」（大意如此）這一場戲，以劇旨講，是也確合乎「劇旨」的，並且顯示民衆的不可輕侮，然而，在我們看來，則覺得這樣的「劇旨」，却還有加以明確的指示的必要，第一，我們應該正確的顯明的指示出民衆的×人是誰，第二，我們必須把×人固定起來，這樣，才不至把狂暴殘酷的×人，悞認爲仁義和平之師，而寄以愛撫的希望，在這種地方，我們唯有以今日的中國人的立塲，來强調「劇旨」，來警吿動搖苟且的落後的民衆；若這樣的主題不把它明朗地表現出來，則可能地會招致許多誤會的。</p>
<p>可遺憾的是『楚霸王』沒有顯明的百分之百的把它做到。</p>
<p>其他的，在劇本編製上，似乎因爲太着重于幾塲重頭戲，把過塲戲忽略了，以致使人有似看京戲的『全部楚漢相爭』之類，形成一齣一齣老戲的連續的感覺，這固然是史料多太，不易處置，但也是因爲劇作者太着重于覇王的匹夫之與的結果，歷史不是個人造成的，太强調了個人，而忽略了他的環境和演變，也是一件危險的事情。</p>
<p>這個，也許是劇作者受了平劇的影響，（攝古裝的片困難，如何跳出平劇的影響，也止是其一）所以在分場上，不自覺的造成如此，而在霸白的編爲上，演員的動作和念白上，也是如此。</p>
<p>王元　的覇王，在粗暴上是有他的可取之處的，但力拔山兮的氣概還不够，特別是馬上央姿，因爲體格的不够，更不足狀這位一世之雄的霸王；金素琴的處姬，戲不多，也許更因爲是初上鏡頭，所以也並不驚人，其他幾位，在氣質上，似也有可商榷的地方。</p>
<p>這個戲最可取之點，是場面的偉大，從這一點上來看，可見不惜工本的，但因爲×我的不够寫得分明，所以雖化費甚大，我們總還不能覺得十分滿意。</p>
<p>攝古裝片有其特殊便利的地方，那是在乎喩古懷今，而這點，以此時此地的中國人來看。在『楚驕王』中，是不够使人過　的。</p>

<h3>Beware of the Aggressors' Conspiracy</h3>
<p>London, 27th - Reuters transmission of a "Daily Express" report states: "The Japanese government has now taken a completely unexpected step towards peace with China. Japan has suggested to the Chinese side that a new government be organized with Chairman Chiang in an important position. If the Chongqing side accepts this suggestion, the majority of Japanese troops in central and southern China will withdraw..." The spread of peace rumors has happened more than once or twice. Upon examining the inner workings, it is nothing more than the conspiracy of the aggressors. To say that the Chinese authorities, amidst the extreme effects of the brutal war of aggression, still have the possibility of making peace halfway is truly absurd and akin to a fool's dream.</p>
<p>What we must pay special attention to regarding this kind of news is the common conspiracy of Eastern and Western aggressors. It is indeed a fact that the Japanese aggressors, because the planned operational period is nearing its end (originally intended to end the war in one year and organize the occupied territories in one year), are eager to end the Sino-Japanese War. However, they must obtain the full price for which the war of aggression was fought before they will give up. Recently, they originally intended to take advantage of the Franco troops approaching French territory and the opportunity for Germany and Italy to restrain Britain and France to seize the price of the nine months of the war of aggression. Therefore, recently, in addition to occupying Hainan Island, they have also created a serious situation in the Shanghai concessions, and there have also been more active military actions on the northern and southern battlefields. Various strongholds along the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong are also within their calculations. However, the situation has unexpectedly turned against Japan's intentions. Britain and France have sought to stabilize the European situation by recognizing the Franco government, and Japan has lost the conditions to demand a price through further coercion. Therefore, it wants to use its political conspiracy to compensate.</p>
<p>If we examine the joint military and diplomatic conference that Germany, Italy, and Japan are holding in Berlin, it is not difficult to think of another basis for this peace rumor. Although Hitler hopes that Japan will "conquer" Asia, he especially desires that Japan has sufficient strength to attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, after the Sino-Japanese War expanded to Wuhan, Germany repeatedly warned Japan not to consume too much strength. Among Germany's targets of aggression, Ukraine occupies a very important position, but Germany cannot attack Ukraine without Japan's response in the East. The issue of the Soviet-Japanese fishing agreement has now reached a critical stage, and what kind of incidents will occur during the April fishing season is something that no one can predict. Hitler cannot ignore this opportunity, and he cannot help but warn Japan again: end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Because of the easing of the European situation, and Japan losing the use of military threats to guarantee the construction of Hainan Island, Japan has no choice but to use the strategy of appeasing Britain and France to allow the United States to maintain its military construction on Hainan Island, in order to complete the two iron fists in the future Pacific War—Taiwan and Hainan Island. The Japanese aircraft bombing the Hong Kong New Territories as a test has met with British resistance. The issue of sending warships to Hainan Island has also been put on the agenda of the British Parliament. France, in order to protect Guangzhou Bay and Annam's territories, is naturally paying more attention to the issue of Hainan Island. Under this situation, Japan has no choice but to use deceptive means to appease Britain and France. It is believed that Japan still needs some time to decide to provoke a Pacific war, waiting for its naval construction in the Pacific to become more complete.</p>
<p>What we should pay special attention to regarding every peace rumor is the conditions for inducing surrender proposed by Japan. In a situation where the Japanese government has repeatedly declared that it does not recognize our national government as a negotiating counterpart, and has repeatedly slandered the highest leader of our resistance against Japan, the sudden emergence of news that "Japan has suggested to the Chinese side that a new government be organized with Chairman Chiang in an important position, and if the Chongqing side accepts this suggestion, the majority of Japanese troops in central and southern China will withdraw" is indeed a bit peculiar. Even if this news is reliable, we must never trust Japan's proposal. The Japanese aggressors have no credibility whatsoever, as the Italian Fanci Pai, who was in the Japanese military and political circles and participated in confidential work, said: "...I don't believe the Japanese military at all. Their saying they are friends with China and friends with other countries is unreliable." We have been fooled by Japan many times in the past few decades. At this critical juncture of survival, we must be more vigilant against the political conspiracy of the aggressors to induce surrender and resolutely stick to the idea of striving for final victory.</p>
<p>Japan is still deceiving the world, especially Britain and France. Japan's hope for this peace is intended to have Britain and France take the field for it. If Britain, America, and France harbor illusions of mediation, then they will be greatly fooled by Japan. Today, Japan is appeasing Britain, America, and France in order to complete the construction of Hainan Island. When its Pacific naval construction is completely successful in the future, it will inevitably turn around and drive the forces of Britain, America, and France out of the Pacific. Japan's existence today is all caused by the deception of the world's major powers. As Fanci Pai said: "Japan's prosperity is all caused by the excessive encouragement of European and American countries, and Britain should be particularly responsible..." "They (referring to Japan) are starting an arrogant boast, and allowing them to boast is indeed a pessimistic thing" (Fanci's talk in Hong Kong). Today, Britain, America, and France should increase their efforts, firstly to make Japan give up Hainan Island; secondly, to make the Japanese troops withdraw entirely from Chinese territory and restore the situation before "September 18th."</p>
<h3>The War in Western Shanxi</h3>
<p>— Guo Congzhou</p>
<p>[Chongqing Hang Telegraph of the Central News Agency] The Fen River and the Lüliang Mountains, naturally forming this area of western Shanxi, the Guancen Mountains that oversee the northwest, are the source of the Fen River, flowing south through Jingle, Yangqu, receiving the Dongshui on the left, and the Wenguhe on the right, crossing Xinjiang and turning west, flowing into the Yellow River at Hejin, which is the second largest tributary of the Yellow River, about 690 kilometers long, forming the "Fen River Land and Sea." The Lüliang Mountains connect to the Guancen Mountains in the north, running vertically between the Yellow River and the Fen River, stopping at the Longmen Mountains by the river. The Lüliang Mountains and its tributaries make western Shanxi a complex "block mountain area."</p>
<p>After the withdrawal from Linfen last March, the counties in western Shanxi also successively fell into the hands of the enemy. However, after a very short period, we finally repelled the occupying enemy troops and successively recovered the counties. However, the Datong-Puzhou Railway in the east, the Fenli Line in the north, and the Wanjiang, Jishan, and Hejin in the south are all in the hands of the enemy. In this way, western Shanxi is in a situation of being surrounded by the enemy on three sides. Despite this, we have restored and consolidated the regime in this area, established guerrilla bases, and become the political and military center supporting the war of resistance in Shanxi. Obviously, this is a major threat to the enemy's rear.</p>
<p>What are the enemy's intentions in launching an offensive against western Shanxi in the past month?</p>
<p>First, to advance into the Lüliang Mountains and "break the political center" (a slogan of the enemy during the "Eight Route Army Encirclement" of Jixian last spring), in order to "mop up" the Lüliang Mountains guerrilla base. Recently, the slogan found by the enemy in Damaigou is "Down with the county government, mop up the guerrillas," which is very clear evidence.</p>
<p>Second, the Datong-Puzhou Railway is often damaged by our army, and the rear communications are constantly threatened. They attempt to build a highway along the west bank of the Fen River, open up another transportation line, control the various ferries of the Fen River, and cut off the connection between eastern and western Shanxi. At the same time, they invade Guxian County in western Shanxi, block the various mountain passes east of the Lüliang Mountains on one side, and repair the semicircular highway of Fenyang-Xixian-Daning-Puxian-Linfen on the other side, which is connected to the Fenxi Highway, in order to increase reinforcements and suppress the activities of our army in the Lüliang Mountains at all times.</p>
<p>Third, south of Hukou on the Yellow River and north of Shijiatan, the inner waterway is narrow and the current is swift. Every year in winter, ice forms. The enemy plans to use the "ice bridge" to cross the river and seize northern Shaanxi, restrain our army, and coordinate with its "fourth-phase operation center" to attack Lanzhou strategically.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning of December of last year, the enemy mobilized the garrison troops on the Datong-Puzhou Line, starting from Xianning in the north and ending at Quhou in the south, and generally crossed the Fen River to invade the west. At that time, our army east and west of the railway immediately cooperated to attack. Except for the Wulong Palace, which was worth 300,000 yuan, being burned down by the enemy, the enemy did not gain anything. Soon after, western Shanxi had heavy snowfall, and the roads were blocked, and the enemy's plan temporarily subsided. However, the enemy's offensive is still being prepared, constantly increasing the number of troops along the Datong-Puzhou Line. It is estimated that about 6,700 in Fenyang and Xiaoyi, 3,000 in Hongtong and Zhaocheng, 3,000 in Quwo, Houma, and Xinjiang, and 2,000 in Hejin and Jishan are invading the west in a big way. The second offensive started on December 24th. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Selected Essays from This Newspaper's Middle School Student Essay Competition – The Issue of Middle School Students' Work for National Salvation During Winter Vacation – First Place, Zhang Dalian, Zhiyong Middle School</h3>
<p>What is valuable in a middle school student in China is known to everyone, especially now during this time of resisting the violent enemy. We do not know how many of our schools have been bombed and burned down; we do not know how many middle school students have suffered misfortunes, carrying their knowledge—knowledge that ordinary people rarely obtain—without contributing even a little to our country, falling by the roadside, lying under collapsed roofs, quietly dying. Or wandering around, unable to find their classrooms. Under these circumstances, what responsibilities will we, the fortunate survivors, shoulder towards national salvation?</p>
<p>We know many things that many people do not know. We really should do what we should do to the best of our ability. However, we are just people receiving education. Because of this, we lack sufficient time. But now the winter vacation is here. This is a good opportunity to exert our full strength. We should seize it tightly.</p>
<p>If, before the winter vacation arrives, we first allocate time and establish a work plan, and then implement it step by step according to this plan, then our work will be systematic, and its effect will definitely be much better than doing it scattered and randomly:</p>
<p>For the national salvation work of our middle school students during the winter vacation, we can divide it into two parts to discuss.</p>
<p>First, many people regard national salvation work as superficial, only thinking that carrying burdens and running to the battlefield, or at least doing the work of organizing and training the masses, or doing propaganda and fundraising, can be considered national salvation work, and fundamentally neglecting the importance of self-improvement. We fully understand that "nation-building will succeed" is closely followed by "resistance war will succeed." If we do not educate ourselves to become the most needed and most useful people in the nation-building period, on whose shoulders will the responsibility of nation-building be placed? And just say in the most immediate resistance war. We need to take up the work of organizing training and propaganda. Is what we know enough to cope with all this and be able to do it very well? This is easy to understand, the answer must be "no." If we ourselves do not have a clear understanding of the War of Resistance, how can we grasp the center of propaganda, and not just shout: "We want to resist the War!" this empty talk? If we cannot analyze and see through current affairs, are we just reading newspapers to people who do not know how to read? If we do not lay a good theoretical foundation for ourselves, how can we organize and train the masses? Do we use an algebraic formula or geometry as the best education? But if you have no way to organize them and go among them, how do you learn?</p>
<p>These questions have clearly told us the importance of self-education in the entire work of national salvation, and it itself must be one of the main tasks of national salvation. In the world facing us, and in this great era, there is too much we need to learn. We do not deny the education that schools give us, which is the main basis for determining the belief that "the nation will succeed." And self-education, whether in the stage of resistance or nation-building, is the most needed and most useful thing.</p>
<p>A person does not need to, and cannot, create an all-rounder. However, in order to adapt to the needs of this objective environment, our knowledge should be multifaceted. All events and academics have their philosophical points of view and basis. Therefore, if we do not have a clear understanding of philosophy, everything we do may be wrong, or at least lack its "soul." Social science, and other books on various theories of resistance, are piled full in bookstores. Usually, due to time constraints, people cannot read them. During this winter vacation, although we cannot read many, it is at least a great opportunity to read. Another very important point is that our attitude towards reading these books should be research-oriented and critical.</p>
<p>If you have several like-minded friends, you can organize a reading seminar. Present a book and have everyone study and discuss it. In this way, not only can everyone guide each other and help each other, so that they can get more benefits, but everyone can also borrow books from each other, and it is also a good way to borrow books!</p>
<p>In addition to this, many people have overlooked one thing, that is, not only is self-criticism the best and most effective self-education, whether in the nation or for individuals. After a job, or at a certain stage, make a general review of your previous work. Keep the good ones forever, and criticize and improve the wrong ones as much as possible. The implementation of this method requires extreme sincerity, frankness, and the greatest enthusiasm for the work. The adoption of this method can make a group more united and work more perfect. The same is true for individuals.</p>
<p>Second, the work of national salvation to the outside world.</p>
<p>The first issue we need to pay attention to is the environmental issue. The environments of each person in each place are different. At the same time, the way we carry out our work is also different. There is no need to choose a better environment. Everyone is on their own post. Moreover, in addition to grasping the environment and adapting to the environment, if we feel that this environment is not good, we must also use various techniques to change this environment.</p>
<p>For the various ways of external national salvation work, there is no need to talk about them all. Just divide them into two aspects: group and individual.</p>
<p>Here, there is no need to exaggerate. To tell the truth, there are still many people around us who are still confused or hold war-weary ideas. However, since they are people of the same country, the same race, and the same world as us, they still have their value in this peaceful war of resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for someone to persuade them. If we encounter an opportunity, we can unceremoniously take on this responsibility. But are we just waiting for the opportunity forever? Absolutely not. At times, we can talk to our friends in letters, but a more effective method is to discuss it face to face. And isn't this winter vacation a good time for us to hold individual talks? Some people have the mistaken idea that such time-consuming trivial matters are not worth doing. Then he underestimates the value of this individual talk. Such talks first give people a sense of intimacy, and do not make them have a bad preconceived notion of you. The less he considers you to be doing propaganda, the greater the effect of your propaganda. It is not so important to people you don't know. If the opponent is a friend, encourage him with frank friendship and move him with true theories. Isn't the effect imaginable? And if you overcome and train a member of the knowledge class, isn't this value greater?</p>
<p>Personal work of this kind can be implemented anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>As for group activities, the scope is wider in terms of both form and content. During a short week-long winter vacation, it is not easy to have a lot of work. This should be noticed when planning in advance. Only seek the quality of its excellence, and do not seek the abundance of its quantity. There is no need to arrange too much work, and make the work outline only an unfulfilled "bad check."</p>
<p>If there were any organizations in the school, it is best not to let it stop its life with the end of the semester, but let it continue to live on the students. In this way, we can save ourselves the trouble of organizing it again, and make the work of the winter vacation and the work during the semester continuous, and continue until the second semester. In this way, not only can we keep working even in the shortest time, but also its significance is greater in the entire student movement and national salvation movement.</p>
<p>However, if there was no organization in the school, we now have to organize a group according to our ability and interest and devote ourselves to one or two national salvation works. Although we may have a slight pause during the organization period, we can extend its life to the next semester and extend it forever until we reach our final goal. Do as much as you can during the winter vacation.</p>
<p>The country has nurtured us, and we dedicate everything to the country; we are a member of the Chinese nation, and dedicate everything to our nation; we live in this world, and dedicate everything to this world. This is beyond doubt!</p>
<p>For true peace, for our eternal survival, we must make our greatest efforts and enthusiasm, not care about all the difficulties and blows, not delay a minute of time, and advance towards the future of resistance and national salvation.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Middle School Students in National Salvation Work: Second Place, Huang Shizhen, True Light Girls' School</h3>
<p>——Review and Preparation That Should Be Done During This Winter Vacation</p>
<p>The purpose of the essay contest held by Shen Bao this time is to set a topic within the scope of "the issue of middle school students' national salvation work during this winter vacation." I believe that focusing solely on the work aspect is still unavoidable to fall into "empty talk," because in reality, the winter vacation period is very short. No matter where you are, it is fundamentally impossible to produce work with significant results. Even if you are just preparing, school will already be starting. In that case, even if there is a very rich and comprehensive work plan, it is just a good-looking article, and it is difficult to target the "current situation." Even if we take a step back, there are still things that can be done later, but based on observations over the past year, the progress of national salvation work is truly not in line with the progress of the war of resistance. This is a major obstacle to achieving victory. What are the reasons for this mismatch? Apart from insufficient objective conditions, solely from the perspective of subjective conditions, the general student body itself has many problems in their work. Since these problems have been discovered in the work, they should be immediately corrected. So, if no other work can be done during this very short winter vacation, this period should be used as an opportunity for reflection and improvement. The actual situation should be like this, so this article also uses this as a topic and bases its argument on this.</p>
<p>We must first discuss what position middle school students occupy on the front lines of the war of resistance and national salvation, and then we can see how serious our mistakes are, and further know what we should improve and prepare. Let us see how important the position of middle school students is on the front lines of the war of resistance and national salvation:</p>
<p>From the perspective of the number of middle school students nationwide, they can exert a significant portion of strength in the nationwide mobilization.</p>
<p>From the perspective of level (including knowledge and ability), they can do the work of enlightening the general masses of farmers and workers, and lead them.</p>
<p>From the perspective of physical fitness, they are all young and strong youth. If they directly participate in combat units, they are also a large group of elite soldiers.</p>
<p>Based on the above three points, we can know how powerful the inherent potential of middle school students is. If this power can be fully developed, it will not only strengthen the front lines of the war of resistance and national salvation, but also accelerate the collapse of the enemy and propel our country towards the final stage of victory.</p>
<p>During the past eighteen months of the war of resistance, the facts tell us that some middle school students have made the greatest efforts and left indelible achievements in the history of the war. For example, directly participating in the ranks of the war of resistance, they appeared very actively on the battlefield and in guerrilla areas, inflicting significant blows on the enemy. Some, after receiving various trainings, served with the army. Regardless of life or death, they went in and out of gunfire, rescuing wounded soldiers; undertaking tasks such as eliminating traitors and transporting supplies, cooperating with the army in combat. Others established national salvation organizations in the less disturbed rear areas, enthusiastically engaged in propaganda, fundraising, persuading people to buy government bonds, donating money, comforting soldiers, and rescuing refugees. All of these can prove that some middle school students have indeed fulfilled their responsibilities and lived up to the country's education.</p>
<p>But conversely, what about the majority of middle school students who were originally in safe areas, and those who moved to safe areas from the occupied areas? Taking Hong Kong as an example, what is mostly manifested are:</p>
<p>(1) Studying textbooks to death, seeking good grades, without caring about the survival of the country. These people believe that studying desperately is fulfilling the duty of a student.</p>
<p>(2) Various national salvation organizations are nominal and peter out. At meetings, they are enthusiastic and speak loudly; the work plans are full of paper. In the end, they disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>(3) After purchasing bonds and donating money, they do not ask about other things, believing that this is fulfilling the responsibility of a citizen. It seems as if they have contributed money, and others have to contribute their efforts, and in the end, victory can be bought with their own money.</p>
<p>(4) The various comfort items made are not practical. For example, the cotton clothes are too thin, and the knitted gloves are too loose, and cannot keep out the cold. They only create large numbers, which are touching and sensational in propaganda.</p>
<p>(5) During concentrated military training, many cannot endure hardship; some even sneak back to Hong Kong as soon as they enter the camp.</p>
<p>(6) Having been stimulated by the environment, they still cannot overcome various temptations, and still go to entertainment venues in large numbers, or play at romance.</p>
<p>From these things, we can also see how serious the mistakes are manifested by the middle school students who occupy an important position on the front lines of the war of resistance. Lacking self-reflection, lacking correction, lacking training—their understanding of the war of resistance is still insufficient, and they lack political cultivation, so they cannot overcome laziness and complacency, and the habit of seeking temporary ease.</p>
<p>We have already said that the winter vacation is very short, and most schools only know what the mistakes are, which does not help future work. Knowing but not being able to correct or replenish is the same mistake as not knowing where the mistake lies. Therefore, I believe that exploring one's own problems is more important than forcing oneself to do a few days of external work without results, and this is indeed a part of national salvation work, and can also be said to be the foundation of national salvation work.</p>
<p>So, what exactly should we do during this winter vacation that will benefit future work? In general, there should be the following items:</p>
<p>First, convene a review meeting among students at the school to conduct a self-criticism of the entire national salvation work in the past. Strictly point out all kinds of efforts and errors, and publicize them as a basis for improvement. After this team is formed, it should be transformed into a supervisory body. After school starts and various national salvation work continues, it will urge its improvement and reduce future defects.</p>
<p>Second, establish a forum. Gather together for two hours each day to discuss various international and domestic issues, increasing our understanding of all aspects. Don't just listen to what others say; we must use our own ability to think and observe to analyze and judge.</p>
<p>Third, students from various schools can voluntarily arrange three or five times during the winter vacation to invite people everyone believes in to speak on various issues that everyone does not understand, providing guidance in thinking.</p>
<p>Fourth, hold reading groups regularly. Students participating in this group can voluntarily contribute money to purchase books about the war of resistance and other knowledge that the school library does not have, and distribute them to everyone immediately. Decide that each person should read at least a certain number of books during this vacation, and stipulate that meetings should be convened at appropriate times to discuss the knowledge gained from the books. At the same time, fully apply general correct theories and understandings to every specific issue.</p>
<p>Fifth, organize visiting teams or investigation teams to investigate the internal situation of various refugee camps and various national salvation organizations, to know what is needed, and to know how others' work is generally done, in order to improve their own work efficiency.</p>
<p>The few things mentioned above are easy to carry out in a short period of time, and are most likely to be effective on one's own. In this winter vacation of just over ten days, I think the most practical work is only these.</p>
<p>In terms of the current environment, work that truly contributes to the war of resistance cannot be completed in a dozen days, even if it is done, it should not be done blindly and confusedly. If you think that you should continue to do what you did in the past, then you will waste time and energy, and the results will not help the progress of the war of resistance. We must know that review and reform are important steps in the work in progress, and also elements of success, especially in national salvation work, which occupies a foundational position. Since the short winter vacation cannot fully develop the abilities of middle school students, then why not seize this opportunity, work hard to correct the defects in the work, and more thoroughly enrich ourselves, strengthen self-training, become a solid soldier, and then engage in arduous struggles? If middle school students can first thoroughly understand the problems in their own work, then the national salvation work they do will be effective and valuable. I hope that the leaders and classmates will point out this idea.</p>

<h3>Our Army Reinforces Henan and Hubei; Enemy's Western Offensives in Central Hubei Suffer Heavy Blows; Large-Scale Guerrilla Warfare in Hebei and Shandong</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] Shaanxi Telegram: The enemy's offensive in central Hubei is an attempt to contain our forces so that they can attack our guerrilla units on the north bank of the Yellow River. However, our military has had meticulous plans for a long time. In addition to increasing our forces to inflict heavy blows on the enemy's western offensives in central Hubei, we have also sent reinforcements to a certain place to prevent the enemy's westward offensive from eastern Henan. The enemy now wants to repair roads outside the railway lines in various key points in Hebei and Shandong in order to control the overall situation, reduce worries about the rear, and then seek to invade the northwest. However, we have launched large-scale guerrilla warfare in Hebei, Shandong, and northern Henan, destroying roads and demolishing cities everywhere, shattering the enemy's plans. Although the enemy has three divisions in Shandong Province, they have attacked us every day for more than a month. We avoid the real and attack the empty, and carry out patrol operations, which eventually put the enemy in a difficult situation and failed to break through. The new line of defense in our various places, southern Hebei, has been constantly fought for more than 20 days since February 9. Nangong and other places have been entered and exited four times. Although the battle situation on the front line has not been reported in detail due to transportation reasons, the enemy has indeed been exhausted, and the Pinghan and Daoqing roads have been destroyed by us from time to time. We will make great progress in the short term. Although the enemy in southwestern Shanxi has slightly increased, it is still transferred from other places.

For example, heavy troops are stationed in Jinghu, Bengbu, Wuhu, Hangzhou and other places as bases for mechanized units. In other occupied areas, only a small number of Japanese troops are stationed. However, foreign observers here said that the new strategy of the Japanese army is extremely unfavorable because a small number of important strongholds are stationed with troops, the transportation lines in the inland occupied areas are tantamount to being abandoned.

<h3>The Situation in Shanghai Slightly Relaxes, but the Situation in Tianjin is Tense Again; Enemy Builds Roads to Surround the British and French Concessions; Authorities of Various Countries Closely Watch the Development of the Situation</h3>

<h3>Auspicious Clouds Covering Changsha</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Geng Ya, of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Changsha, generously referred to as having "only taken a fiery bath," naturally has many people with a particularly transcendent imagination—they believe that Changsha's location makes it nearly impossible to avoid being sacrificed or destroyed in this war of resistance. This is not to say that our scorched-earth policy allows us to sacrifice it at will; it is to say that the *'s brutality and indiscriminate burning and killing means that they certainly will not easily let go of the provincial capital, the essence of Hunan. Therefore, Changsha seems destined for a certain fate, though not to be reduced to ashes by the *'s arson like Shanghai and Nanjing, it will inevitably suffer like Guilin and Guiyang from indiscriminate bombing and burning by * planes. In any case, it will not easily maintain its golden integrity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they also believe that although Changsha is now destroyed, the scorched earth still belongs to us. As the ancients said, "With land comes wealth." They also said, "The country is built by the people." In the future, what kind of fashionable new clothes shall we dress this Changsha, which has just suffered grievances and undergone a "fiery bath"? What kind of healthy and beautiful figure shall we cultivate it into? This is entirely in our hands and not difficult at all.</p>
<p>There are also a few individual surveys of the disaster victims' consciousness. The important excerpts are noted below:</p>
<p>"If they hadn't added fuel to the fire later, the houses in our area wouldn't have burned so badly; moreover, nothing happened on the first night..." A middle-aged disaster victim surnamed Wang sighed and said; but his words were interrupted by a vendor setting up a stall on the spot:</p>
<p>"Is that still worth saying? How many banknotes and receipts from the ×× Bank couldn't be moved out and were burned anyway!"</p>
<p>"The bank—that's public property!"</p>
<p>"Public property? Public money is still national money!"</p>
<p>"That's right, whether public or private, having a little more money is good for fighting the *s a little harder!" The one surnamed Wang, as if newly enlightened, turned the conversation back to the center of the war of resistance: "Originally, I didn't engage in useless regret for the accomplished fact of the fire. However, we must grieve the magnitude of the loss from this fire. Everyone should grit their teeth, try their best to recover, those who can resume business should resume business quickly to strive for production; those who cannot resume business should quickly organize to help the resistance forces carry the wounded soldiers!"</p>
<p>Of course, in fact, there will never be a large number of wounded soldiers needing thousands and tens of thousands of disaster victims to organize stretcher teams to transport them. However, in the mouths of ordinary people, the phrase "carry the wounded soldiers" cannot be viewed too simplistically. It is full of enthusiasm, including all departments of wartime labor that the people can do! If we can guide and train them appropriately, wouldn't we be adding a new force to the battlefield service?</p>
<p>"Police officer! During the last fire, I don't think you would have retreated completely as generally rumored, right?" I politely asked a police officer standing guard.</p>
<p>"No? We were just transferred from other places to serve. We dare not say what the situation was like during the fire, but many of our comrades have vowed to avenge the past injustice. In the long days ahead, if we encounter an emergency situation again, every post our police put out will be like an iron tree planted with deep roots, blooming and dying there—we will never make the same joke as last time."</p>
<p>What is the mission of the police in extraordinary times? It seems that it depends on the situation at the time and cannot be rigidly demanded of them; but it must be said that their ability to have this new, clear-cut, and conscious determination is a commendable cleansing given to them by the fire.</p>
<p>From a large circle of burned-out courtyards, two innocent girls ran out, about eleven or twelve years old, chasing each other, simply kicking the rubble on the ground with a loud crash. Looking into the courtyard along the line they ran out of, there were two or three factory sheds leaning against the wall. In the courtyard were stone flower terraces, broken flower pots, and charred embers of flowers and trees. In the past, it must have been a refined household.</p>
<p>"Little friends, are you still so happy? Look at your houses..."</p>
<p>"Um! This—what does it matter? As long as the front lines win victories, as long as we drive away the Japanese *s, that's better than living in the "Imperial Palace"...' Before she finished speaking, she jumped and ran back into the courtyard.</p>
<p>They were as lively and alert as two clever birds, and I wished I could pull them back to talk a few more words; however, "fragrance doesn't need to be plentiful," these few words are enough. Stalin said, "Youth and children are our hope, our future." So, how far-reaching will the future of our national liberation war be? And how much more glorious will the new China growing up be in the future? It is not difficult to imagine and obtain its symbolism from the vigilant conversation of these two little birds.</p>
<p>Also: When the reporter arrived in Changsha and when he left, it was both at four o'clock in the morning. In the darkness, he turned and turned through many streets. What was particularly special was: he never heard a single rooster crowing, but as soon as the east turned white, whether near or far, in broken walls and ruined courtyards, or in ancient temples in the countryside, the loud military bugle would suddenly blow out and the majestic songs would start, causing the whole of "sleepy-eyed" Changsha, it seemed, to tremble! Then, "light" stood on the post of "darkness"! What else does this symbolize? Of course, it is even easier to imagine.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Ren, a Western doctor who is in charge of Xiangya Hospital, and Misses Fei and Han, although they are blue-eyed and blond, are very sympathetic to our war of resistance. They help us treat wounded soldiers and the poor and sick for free. Because they do not have enough manpower, they are so tired that they even have to cut back on their meal times, but they are very happy. They are always smiling when they see people!</p>
<p>Once, Mr. Tian Han published an article "China's Medical Education," saying that foreigners like Mr. Gu Ren and Misses Fei and He are righteously helping us rescue wounded soldiers, but our own doctors and nurses with medical experience have fled far away. Can they betray their conscience?</p>
<p>When Mr. Gu Ren saw this article, he smiled from ear to ear and said to people: "The original intention of learning medicine is to help the world and save people. Misses Fei, He, and I have been serving Chinese society for many years. Now that China is fighting Japan's fascism for world peace, human justice, and national liberation, we will certainly do our best to assist, so as to adhere to our original intentions. However, we apologize for our weak ability and inability to provide extensive relief; we are still praised by public opinion, how dare we be worthy of it!" A few days later, the hospital added a ward and hired a doctor and four nurses.</p>
<p>——Overall, the various phenomena after the robbery in Changsha, as well as the psychology of ordinary citizens, although seemingly disparate and unrelated, in spirit, they have a common ideology, that is, everyone unanimously wants to support the long-term resistance to the war, striving for final victory and seeking compensation from Japanese fascists for all the losses and sacrifices of the Changsha fire! Moreover, the symbols of the final victory that must belong to us are emerging endlessly, already visibly forming a fresh and auspicious aura in the air above the scorched earth!</p>

<h3>Fierce Debate in the British House of Commons: Attlee Fiercely Criticizes the Prime Minister; Chamberlain Responds Eloquently; Motion of Censure Ultimately Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 1st] Yesterday, Clement Attlee, the leader of the anti-government faction of the British Labour Party, introduced a motion of censure against the government, questioning Chamberlain's authority to unilaterally recognize the Spanish rebel government. He also criticized Chamberlain for not notifying the House of Commons in advance regarding the recognition of the rebel government, and stated that Chamberlain had opposed further investigation of the matter this week. Chamberlain interjected, "At the time, I meant that I could not answer immediately because I had not been notified in advance." Attlee continued, stating that Chamberlain wanted to defend his actions with a partial truth, and that this partial truth was even more hateful than a lie. Chamberlain stated that the part of Spain controlled by the current Spanish government is very weak, but the Spanish government still has power and possesses an army of 500,000 men. Chamberlain's disregard for international law is unmatched by anyone. It is unknown what guarantees Chamberlain obtained to ensure that Franco would not immediately join the Berlin-Rome Axis after being recognized. Chamberlain replied that he had not heard such a fierce attack on an individual in a long time. He reminded the House of Commons that the debaters belong to the most important issue, and turning the discussion of important issues into personal attacks seems to hinder your dignity. Chamberlain denied that he had obscured the House of Commons on Monday to avoid debate regarding Attlee's accusations. Attlee frankly stated that French Prime Minister Daladier told the French Assembly on February 24 that the British government had decided to recognize the Franco government. Chamberlain replied that what Attlee said was not true. Chamberlain then read Daladier's original words at the time, stating that this was not a decision, but an expression of opinion. Chamberlain stated, "We have two wishes. We believe that the time has come to recognize the Franco government. We hope to maintain consistency with the French government. We do not want to recognize it until France has agreed to this move."</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, responding to the Labour Party's motion of censure against the government, stated, "France's attitude towards recognizing the Franco government had not been decided until last Friday. I once said that France could not make a final decision until after Friday, which is completely correct. In fact, the decision was made on the weekend. As for whether recognizing the Franco government would destroy the confidence and goodwill of democratic countries towards Britain, I really cannot believe it. Look at the democratic country of France, whose opinions and actions are completely consistent with ours." Regarding the question of whether the British government's recognition of Franco was a violation of international tradition, Chamberlain stated, "Such events have not happened for the first time; there have been precedents in the past." Then he cited international law to prove that the government's actions were in accordance with general precedents, and said, "After General Franco occupied Barcelona and Catalonia, he still could not obtain a superior position? Can the Republican government still be called the legitimate government? The answer to this question is very obvious. Does the Republican government still have enough weapons and food to continue fighting? What is the hope of final victory? The area of the Republican government that has not been occupied is now small, and no one knows how to form a government. The president has resigned, some cabinet members are in France, and other cabinet members are in Spain. It is doubtful that such a government can be considered a legitimate government. Therefore, I say that if recognizing the Franco government is said to violate international traditional habits, it is more appropriate to say that not recognizing the Franco government goes against international traditions. If we do not recognize the Franco government, there will be no benefit to the Spanish Republican government and the people of Madrid, but it will only make the relationship between Britain and the new Spanish government not harmonious. Moreover, the Franco government has made guarantees to the British government that it will not take retaliatory measures against political prisoners." At this time, Chamberlain read the documents sent by Franco to Britain, including this guarantee. Chamberlain continued, "Spain will never accept foreign interference that damages its dignity and sovereignty. Opposition party members have earnestly stated the cruel actions of Franco's troops, but have not said a word about similar actions on the Republican side. Therefore, it is unreasonable to ask General Franco to pardon all those who have committed the most terrible crimes in advance. Many countries have now recognized the Franco government. This is actually an action to maintain formal contact between Britain and the Franco government. What is needed now is to stop the Spanish war. If Britain can find a way to have representatives from both sides of the Spanish war negotiate a ceasefire, it will be happy to do so. I believe that peace in Spain will be realized soon. Once the war stops, I hope the Spanish people will work hard to restore what the war has destroyed and rebuild a prosperous and happy country with a glorious history."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, February 28th] The British Labour Party's motion of censure due to the government's recognition of the Franco government, after a long debate, was rejected this evening by a vote of 344 to 137.</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Withdraws Envoys to France; Embassies and Consulates Taken Over; Rumor Has It U.S. Will Follow the Lead of Britain and France</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] Representatives of the Franco government officially took over the Spanish Embassy here at 6 PM last night. The diplomatic representatives were accompanied by several French Foreign Ministry officials to the Spanish Embassy. At 6:15 PM, the flag of the Franco government was hoisted on the roof. About 100 colonists supporting Franco saluted the flag and shouted "Franco," but no disturbances occurred.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 1st] It has just been learned that according to reports received from various places here yesterday, officials from the Spanish Republican government consulates in various parts of France have withdrawn, and representatives of the Franco government have taken over. "Le Temps" stated that Panbi Nansi's consul, Chalitai, went elsewhere three days ago.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, February 28th] After the French government recognized the Franco government, the Spanish Republican government ambassador left the embassy in the afternoon and bid farewell to Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. The embassy was also transferred by the French authorities to Leon, the representative of the National Army government stationed in France (who served as ambassador to France during the monarchy), who changed the flag to the National Army flag. Baso, Speaker of the Spanish Parliament, told Havas reporters that President Azana's letter of resignation has been received. According to the constitution, at least 100 members of parliament must be present to authorize the Speaker of the House to act as president.</p>
<p>[Reuters Burgos, February 28th] Hudson, the British representative sent to contact the Franco government, met with General Jordana today. Jordana said that the current government welcomed Mr. Hudson as chargé d'affaires before the British government sent an ambassador. Hudson hoped to see the British flag flying in Burgos soon. Here, there is no expression regarding the recognition of the British and French governments, as if Australia does not care.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, February 28th] The official here is currently silent regarding the British and French recognition of the Franco government. However, well-informed sources believe that the United States will soon follow in the footsteps of Britain and France and grant recognition. President Roosevelt mentioned the actions of Britain and France at a State Department meeting, and the Spanish Ambassador to the United States, Silva Seri, also visited Secretary of State Hull, claiming that he is still the ambassador to the United States for the legitimate Spanish government. It is reported that businessmen with interests in Spain are now putting pressure on the government, hoping for early recognition of Franco. Public opinion, however, is quite divided.</p>
<p>[Reuters Belgrade, February 28th] Today, the Yugoslav government decided to grant legal recognition to the Spanish rebel government.</p>
<p>Spanish President's Letter of Resignation</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] Spanish Republican President Azana's letter of resignation to National Assembly Chairman Barrio was made public to reporters by his secretary in Collonges-sous-Salève yesterday. The letter stated, "The commander-in-chief of military affairs in central Spain reported to me in front of the military that the war was lost by the Spanish Republican government and suggested that I prepare to leave Spain. I believe that it is my duty to immediately conclude a peace agreement and maintain humanity, so as to avoid unnecessary sacrifice for the soldiers defending the country and the people of the whole country. I have personally worked hard, hoping to realize this wish, but I have not succeeded. What is even more advanced is that major powers such as Britain and France have actually recognized the government of Burgos as legitimate, so that I cannot announce the procedures for resignation to the governments of various countries, but I am a Spaniard and driven by my conscience, I do not want to put the people of the whole country in a long-term war. The administrative institutions of the Spanish government have now been dismantled. I only hope that domestic and foreign groups will follow my wishes to cope with the situation. I really cannot stay in office, which will hinder the realization of peace." It is noted that the letter was signed and dated on February 27th.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] Political circles here commented on President Azana's resignation and stated his political achievements in Spain, saying that Azana strongly advocated joining the Allied forces during the European War. Before General Rivera's coup in 1923, he belonged to the Reform Party, and later joined the Republican Party and led the Republican movement. After Spain declared a republic in 1931, he served as Minister of War in the Zamora cabinet. Six months later, Zamora resigned, and Azana succeeded him as Prime Minister. Catalonia declared autonomy in 1931, and an anarchist movement broke out the following year. Azana was chased to resign in September. In 1934, Catalonia launched another anti-Catholic riot. Azana was elected President of the "Catalonian United Republican Government." That movement ultimately failed, and Azana was banned by the Madrid government. Later, he was secretly tried by the High Court of the Spanish Republican Government and restored his freedom. He resumed his post as Prime Minister in May 1936. In May 1936, he succeeded Zamora as President. Two months later, the Spanish war broke out.</p>
<h3>US Senate Debate: Army and Air Force Expansion Bill; Senator Lee Expresses Support, Calling it a Response to Dictatorship</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, February 28] Today, during the US Senate debate on the Army and Air Force expansion bill, Senator Clark launched a fierce attack on the bill, stating that the United States faced no danger and that the bill's drafting was due to a case of hysteria. "European warmongers, after only twenty years, are stirring up another war. They spare no effort in their schemes to instigate war," he said. Senator Borah also expressed similar views, calling the bill a "hollow show of strength," and claiming that military experts had told him that the 3,700 aircraft the authorities planned to purchase were "beyond the Army's needs." At the same time, twelve Liberal senators proposed restoring the Ludlow Amendment to the Neutrality Act, which would require a national referendum before the government could declare war. Senator La Follette supported this proposal, stating that the amendment "would provide a final check on secret diplomacy that draws us into foreign wars," and adding that the last British involvement in war was the result of such secret diplomacy. Senator Lee rose to express his support for the bill, stating that "the only language dictators understand" is this bill. Subsequently, after a lengthy debate on the purchase of aircraft by France, Senator Nye stated that he believed the United States should forever cease selling aircraft to foreign countries. He questioned, "Why should we arm the world for a small profit, only to have the armed turn against us?" and added, "The Japanese aircraft that bombed our warship 'Panay' used American gasoline, and its bombs were made of American metal." Senator Borah also participated in this debate, stating that the United States had been selling military supplies to Germany for years, only stopping after Germany demanded colonies, which he called a peculiar form of neutrality. Subsequently, Democratic Senators Barkley and Lee defended the sale of aircraft to France, stating that it was entirely appropriate. Lee stated, "The more aircraft we sell to democratic nations, the fewer aircraft our own United States will need. If the strength of the democratic nations is comparable to that of Germany, there will be no Munich Agreement, and no downfall of Czechoslovakia."</p>
<h3>Guam Not Fortified</h3>
<p>US Navy and Marine Corps Disappointed</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, February 28] US Navy and Marine Corps officials have expressed disappointment over the rejection of the Guam fortification plan. The Navy and Marine Corps believe that while the lack of fortification on Guam may have little importance in terms of national defense, the fact that Japan may now mistakenly perceive the US's Far Eastern policy as turning weak is of great significance. Senior Army officials stated that the rumor that fortifying Guam was akin to holding a knife to Japan's throat was unfounded. The intention of fortifying the island was to warn the Japanese people that while the United States did not wish to be drawn into the vortex of war, it strongly opposed Japan's acts of aggression and was dissatisfied with Japan's foreign policy. Not fortifying Guam would only encourage Japan to implement further policies of aggression, they said.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, March 1] The "Daily Mail" reports that the most noteworthy aspect of the naval budget announced by the British Admiralty yesterday is the British government's decision to allocate an additional five million pounds to strengthen its Eastern fortress, namely to add naval bases suitable for aircraft in Singapore, Ceylon, and Aden.

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>The Power of the Countercurrent</h3>
<p>The darkness before dawn may be even more terrifying. In the raging torrent of the times, there will inevitably be turbulent countercurrents. Recent developments in international affairs have also revealed countercurrents, starting with the xxxxxx's policy of compromise with aggressive nations, and including the recent recognition of the Franco government by the British and French governments, and the US's rejection of the Guam fortification plan, which can be described as the most alarming countercurrents. Our x people, pro-Japanese, anti-communist, and pro-peace elements, are taking advantage of this countercurrent to denigrate the peace front, denigrate the United Nations striving for peace, denigrate our country's twenty months of heroic resistance, while exaggerating the greatness of the fascist aggressors' power, and concluding that we must submit to this power, we must submit to the dark forces and countercurrents!</p>
<p>However, the activities of these x people, traitors, pro-Japanese, anti-communist, and pro-peace elements are unfounded. First, although many countercurrents have emerged in the current struggle against fascism, the power of these countercurrents is limited and can be overcome. For example, the British and French rulers' recognition of the Spanish rebel government has already triggered and developed a high tide of the Anti-Appeasement Movement among righteous people throughout Britain. In recent days, the British and French people have been constantly holding parades and demonstrations. Although the British Labour Party's motion to censure the government was rejected on the 28th by a vote of 344 to 137, the power of the 137 dissenting votes is a force not to be ignored in the future. In addition, yesterday (March 1), a rally to boycott Japanese goods was held in London, with balloons bearing slogans supporting China flying across the sky, indicating that a vast and strong force is also developing at an accelerated pace along with the political countercurrents! Secondly, such as the US Senate's rejection of the Guam defense plan, has now aroused opposition from people across the country, that the Army and Navy authorities also unanimously recognized that this move greatly reduced the United States' status in the Pacific, enough to create the crime of helping Japanese x to expand the world war. In addition, such as the US House of Representatives' rejection of the US restriction of silver purchase bill, Morganthau's advocacy of giving the government extraordinary powers, are all visible to the rising strength of the American people's anti-fascist aggression forces, and can also see that the isolationalist faction's attempt to violate public opinion, and its future will eventually fail.</p>
<p>Second, the x people, traitors, pro-Japanese, anti-communist, and pro-peace elements' attacks on the Soviet Union's peaceful policies, on our country's long-term resistance, and on the democratic peace front are also unfounded. First, the Soviet Union's domestic strength is developing, and the Third Five-Year Plan will make important decisions at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party on the 10th of this month to ensure the progress of the Soviet Union's defense strength and the people's lives. Second, our country's war situation is moving straight toward a "x our strength are equal x" situation, new troops are constantly growing, and international assistance is also making great progress with the new adventures of the Japanese x. The close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is an even greater guarantee. As for the rulers of a few countries within the pro-peace front, although they disregard the country and the world for the temporary interests of their own class and have a tendency to reverse course, the forces they represent are a small number of financial capitalists, and their strength is not worth paying attention to. At the same time, the increasingly developing people's front movement is a major obstacle to the development of reactionary forces.</p>
<p>Let us wake up in the darkness before dawn! Let us be invigorated in the face of the countercurrent of the times! Our ranks will be vast and strong!</p>
<h3>Balloons Released in London to Support China; Lady Gladstone Speaks, Urging Britons to Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, March 1] The rally to boycott Japanese goods here was held today, chaired by Lady Gladstone, who gave a speech urging Britons not to wear Japanese silk stockings or use Japanese ties anymore, stating that there was no benefit to wearing Japanese silk fabrics, and that the gold thread used to buy Japanese silk fabrics was all used for the purpose of massacring humanity, which British people all knew well and should not knowingly commit such acts. After the speech, several hundred balloons bearing slogans supporting China were released into the air by the actress Miss Bradley, filling the sky. Each balloon had large-character slogans such as "Boycott Japanese Goods," "Don't Wear Japanese Silk Stockings," and "Support China," as well as a prize incentive for whoever found the balloon that flew the farthest.</p>
<h3>Ciano's Visit to Poland Fails; Germany and Italy to Hold Consultations to Discuss General Axis Policies; Italy to Increase Troops in Libyan Territory</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, March 1] According to forecasts from Berlin in various newspapers here, Hitler and Mussolini may hold consultations in northern Italy, because the Axis policies of Germany and Italy need to be re-examined after the changes in the European situation. Berlin officials do not attach as much importance to Ciano's failed visit to Poland as generally imagined. They believe that Ciano's failure to obtain any assurances from Polish Foreign Minister Beck regarding the future involvement of France in the war was expected. For this reason, the dictators intend to hold consultations to discuss general policies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, February 28] Well-informed sources here recently declared that Italian Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Bastianini had yesterday informed British Ambassador Perth that after France repeatedly dispatched troops to Tunisia in North Africa, Italy's ability to transfer troops in times of emergency was not as fast as France's. Therefore, it is planned to send a large number of troops to Libyan territory in North Africa. Ambassador Perth, upon hearing this, expressed his regret.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, February 28] After Guazzone, the Rome correspondent for the Belgian "Indépendance Belge," was expelled by the Italian authorities, the French government has decided to expel the Paris correspondent for the Italian "La Stampa," Monelli, and has ordered him to leave France within a week.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, March 1] The Governor of French Tunisia, La Bonneterie, announced that he would be inspecting central and southern Tunisia in the coming days. Furthermore, French officials are very concerned about the night-time exercises of the aircraft detachment attached to the French Mediterranean Fleet. It is reported that the fleet has been patrolling the coast of North Africa for several weeks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, March 1] According to a correspondent for the Italian official news agency ANSA in Tunis, France is greatly expanding its military force along the Tunisian border with Libya, with many ships transporting military supplies and many trains filled with soldiers and munitions arriving in Tunis at night. As a result, rumors are rampant, and business is suffering. At the same time, Italian Chief of Staff General Badoglio has returned to Italy from Tripoli after inspecting the Italian defense lines in North Africa for eight days.</p>
<h3>Madame Tabouis Publishes "The Undercurrents of the Nazi Government"</h3>
<p>—Translated by Huang Ping</p>
<p>—The Inside Story of Goebbels Being Beaten—</p>
<p>Everyone should remember that not long ago, there was news that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels had been beaten up for flirting. Later, there was a different report that Goebbels's beating was not really due to flirting, but the result of infighting among Nazi government officials for power and profit, but no truthful facts were published at that time. Recently, the famous French journalist Madame Tabouis, who specializes in the study of European political situations, published an article in the weekly "L'Œuvre," revealing the truth about the infighting among Nazi government officials. Although she does not state that this is the real reason for Goebbels's beating, it is clear to discerning people.</p>
<p>The following is only an excerpt from her article - Translator.</p>
<p>Although Hitler is a busybody, he has never been very happy to interfere in other people's private affairs. In the past, in many purges, although the crimes of "personal disgrace" and "improper behavior" were often seen, that was just talk; everything had its own political reasons.</p>
<p>However, there is an exception now: Hitler has expressed dissatisfaction with the private life of his propaganda minister, Goebbels. He believes that Goebbels's enjoyment is too extravagant and cannot share the hardships with other Nazi leaders. According to Hitler's opinion, life in the world has only one goal: to work for Nazism, to do one's best, and to die only after completing one's service.</p>
<p>The other Nazi leaders—except for Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who is a special exception approved by Hitler—are all very frugal. They rarely eat a hearty meal and never seek out entertainment beyond the regulations; all they are busy with all day long is their work.</p>
<p>Goebbels is different; his life is indeed unusually extravagant: he eats delicacies and fine wines, lives in luxurious apartments, has servants and many cars; all this is something Hitler cannot tolerate.</p>
<p>At the most recent celebration of the anniversary of the founding of the Nazi Party, Hitler, in addition to reviewing the past achievements of the Nazi Party, praised all the Nazi government leaders one by one. Only one person was not mentioned, and that was Goebbels.</p>
<p>Not long after, Hitler suddenly organized a "Newspaper Incitement Department" dedicated to studying and dealing with foreign newspapers attacking Germany. This new organization was not subordinate to Propaganda Minister Goebbels but was directly controlled by Hitler's deputy Hess. All policies were instructed by Hitler himself and handled jointly by representatives of Goebbels, Secret Police Chief Himmler, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop.</p>
<p>The purpose of this new organization is undoubtedly to strengthen Germany's propaganda work, hoping to obtain better propaganda results under the cooperation of the Propaganda Department, the Secret Police Department, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and under the leadership of the leader and his deputy.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the new organization, the first person affected was naturally Goebbels. Not only did he lose face in propaganda work, but his general status was also greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Goebbels's misfortune was not accidental but the result of his quarrel with Secret Police Chief Himmler not long ago.</p>
<p>In Germany, everyone knows that Goebbels and Himmler have always been somewhat irreconcilable. Both of them have hired many spies to operate domestically and abroad. In the past two years, Himmler has used various methods to recruit many of Goebbels's spies into the secret police. In this way, Goebbels could not command those spies who were nominally under his command.</p>
<p>Himmler was not satisfied with taking this advantage. Recently, he suddenly launched a major attack on Goebbels. He said that, according to information he had obtained from abroad, Goebbels's propaganda policy was completely wrong. He believed that there were many things that could only be said to Nazi personnel in secret, but Goebbels disregarded everything and spread them abroad. He criticized Goebbels for talking too much.</p>
<p>This time, Goebbels could not bear it anymore and turned against him, stating that his propaganda work was entirely based on the instructions of the leader and did not need others to interfere. As a result, the two became increasingly at odds and became mortal enemies.</p>
<p>Goebbels is indeed a brilliant propaganda talent. In Germany and in the world, he is considered top-notch, but when it comes to secret work, he is no match for Himmler. Moreover, the two of them know each other's many private scandals very clearly. Goebbels was too embarrassed to use his propaganda skills, but Himmler unceremoniously publicized all of Goebbels's private affairs. Therefore, not long ago, Goebbels's rumors were rampant, making him look like he was about to be disgraced.</p>
<p>Hitler also knew about this. He was already not very satisfied with Goebbels's extravagant life, and this made him even more dissatisfied. However, Goebbels in Germany is considered second only to Goering in terms of his leading role. Hitler had to be lenient and have some scruples.</p>
<p>As a result, after Hitler considered it, he used the method mentioned earlier to embarrass Goebbels.</p>
<p>After Goebbels received this punishment, he was indeed very unhappy. Therefore, some time ago, when Germany was busy with the anti-American movement, he did not come out to lead it, expressing passivity. Later, after much persuasion from Goering, Hess, and Ribbentrop, he agreed to reorganize and boasted that only he could incite the German people to participate in the war against capitalism.</p>
<p>Although the dispute can be considered to have come to an end, the infighting among Nazi personnel will always exist. The old grudges have not been resolved. Goebbels has suffered this loss from Himmler, and he will always want to retaliate in the future. Everyone is waiting to see.</p>

<h3>Fourth Day of Racing; "Noose Early" Easily Takes the Championship; "Trot Lucky" Withdraws</h3>
<p>Yesterday, most horse racing fans originally intended to see how fierce the competition between "Noose Early" and "Trot Lucky" would be for the championship and who would ultimately win, but they were greatly disappointed because "Trot Lucky" did not appear, allowing "Noose Early" to show off and return with a triumphant song. It turned out that "Trot Lucky" suddenly suffered from diarrhea yesterday and was in critical condition, so he was forced to withdraw. As for the races, because horses that had won once in the previous three days were disqualified and could not participate, and after several days of observation, the strengths and weaknesses were clear, and everyone knew them well. As a result, good horses received enthusiastic support, and inferior horses were almost ignored. As a result, all the "hot" horses won, and the lottery payouts for each race were extremely small. In the Double Event, two horses tied for first place, and each ticket was only worth more than eight dollars, setting a new low record. There is a two-day break today and tomorrow, and there will be another race on Saturday, which will mark the end of this meeting.</p>

<h3>Siamese Government Revises Tariffs, Heavily Taxing Our Imports While Reducing Tariffs on Japanese Imports: Chaozhou Merchants Association Asks the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Negotiate Based on Reason</h3>
<p>Recently, the Siamese government authorities have particularly increased the taxation on goods imported from our country. The tax rates on all kinds of goods shipped from our country to Siam have increased by one or several times compared to usual, greatly affecting the business of overseas Chinese in Siam. The Chaozhou Eight Districts Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has repeatedly received reports from overseas Chinese in Siam and yesterday submitted a petition to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting that the commercial attaché stationed in Siam negotiate based on reason to alleviate the difficulties of overseas Chinese merchants. It has been learned that the Siamese government announced the revision of tariffs last week, and the items that have been increased are mostly food products exported from our country to Siam, but taxes on agricultural tools, fertilizers, machinery, medical equipment, and scientific instruments have been reduced. It has also been learned that Japan exports the most of the above items to Siam. Now, Siam has increased the import tax on Chinese goods on the one hand and reduced taxes on Japanese goods on the other, and its fawning over the invading country is obvious.</p>

Unable to hold on, he fell into a pool of blood. The vegetable stall owners in the market saw that the murderer was so fierce and did not dare to approach and fight. They blew the police whistle, and the murderer hurriedly abandoned the knife and fled. After the police heard the news, they immediately went inside to investigate and saw that Mr. Deng was already dying and lying on the ground. As the case was suspected of attempted murder, they immediately returned to the police station to report. The on-duty assistant dispatched several detectives from the Central and Western Districts Police Station, along with an assistant in charge of murder cases, to the scene of the incident to investigate and inquire about the statements of various people for future reference and to issue an arrest warrant for the fugitive murderer. The victim's injuries were critical, and his life was in danger.</p>

<h3>In the Midst of Rising Firewood Prices, There Are Actually Major Merchants Plotting a Monopoly: Hope the Authorities Pay Attention</h3>
<p>As × people invade South China and war breaks out, transportation between Hong Kong and the mainland is blocked, the source of firewood is interrupted, and market prices immediately rise, which has a profound impact on the lower and middle classes. Therefore, the Hong Kong government authorities instructed the corps to discuss special relief measures. According to the Western newspaper, the *Sing Pao* yesterday, it was said that according to reliable sources, several major merchants in Hong Kong are carrying out capital pool to monopolize firewood and charcoal to raise prices and profit from it. Although the detailed situation is not yet known, the newspaper has found out the names of these major merchants.

It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's Essay Competition Award Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>From Strangers to New Acquaintances</p>
<p>Young people don't have the bad habit of being late for meetings. Yesterday afternoon, before 2:00 pm, the young friends who were warmly welcomed by this newspaper gathered one after another in a beautiful hall on the second floor of the Winsor Hotel.</p>
<p>The names of the twenty-five people selected for this newspaper's essay competition for middle school students have slipped through our hands countless times, and have been reflected in our eyes countless times, but what exactly do their appearances look like? This interesting imagination was vividly captured until yesterday. In the realm of friendship, this is a mysterious paragraph.</p>
<p>An Excellent Group</p>
<p>Ah! So you are thin, you are short and fat, your student uniform is truly the style of a student, and your suit is also very much the style of a Hong Kong student; study hard, you are already wearing glasses; the life of fleeing has tormented you, your green face has been engraved with traces of wind and frost! Unfortunately, the reporter cannot open up the conversation with this excellent group in detail, but only briefly greets each person in the limited short time.</p>
<p>The first-place winner, Zhang Dalian, is from Jiangsu and used to study at Guangzhong Middle School in Shanghai. His father went south to work, and he only entered Zhiyong Middle School's high school program to study for a year. He is quite tall and healthy, and looks like a mature and steady person. As the champion, he is naturally the most noticeable person in the entire venue.</p>
<p>The second-place winner, Miss Huang Baozhen, wears glasses and has the demeanor of a scholar. All four women in the entire venue are classmates from their Zhenguang school. They rival each other with the six classmates from the Guangzhou People's Affiliated Middle School. The group results of their two schools are both relatively outstanding. The two schools are also schools that fled.</p>
<p>The third-place winner, Mr. Zhu Xinghua, is an overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia and has been in Hong Kong for three years. He speaks fluent Mandarin. He is dressed in a Western suit, but in a short conversation, one can also detect that he is a young medical student with a "soul."</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Lian, Xu Ruxian, and Liu Shizhi are old students in Hong Kong. Mr. Wei Beinan is from Shantou, Mr. Fei is from Taishan, Mr. Chen Jiongchao is from Guangzhou, Miss Guan Zhenru is from Kaiping, and Mr. Mo Yule is from Dongguan. These students have only been studying in Hong Kong for a year and a half because of the war.</p>
<p>In addition, there are Yin Songping, Zheng Shuicheng, Wu Boshan, Lu Jingwei, He Zhuoliu, Huang Shunuang, Huang Fangao, Sheng Cishi, Chen Jianqi, Huang Yingyuan, Wen Gongli, but there was no time for a long conversation. A total of twenty-two students attended, and three others were unable to attend due to other commitments. More than ten colleagues from this newspaper participated, and the gathering was lively and filled with the joy of youth.</p>
<p>Meeting and Encouragement</p>
<p>The meeting began, and Mr. Bu Tao first gave a speech: "Newspapers are a form of social education. This newspaper, based on its consistent historical spirit, spares no effort in promoting cultural movements. This newspaper held a middle school student essay competition this time, and we are very grateful to all of you for your enthusiastic participation. We hope to continue to stand together in the future and continue to work hard for the country and for culture..."</p>
<p>After Mr. Lu Fu reported on the process of this essay competition and judging, Mr. Wu Jingsong gave a speech: "...In Hong Kong, one can see the emphasis on physical sports and competition and the neglect of mental training and competition. Physical education is something we Chinese should promote, but cultural movements should also absolutely not be neglected because culture is the foundation of national survival. During the period of resistance against Japan, we must not only preserve our culture but also improve our culture and promote the current stage of struggle culture. We are in Hong Kong, this special region, and we should sow some seeds well. It is easier to carry out work here with young people and women. We hope that you will work hard to make a difference locally and to connect your work and spirit with those at home and abroad. One more effort will bring one more harvest."</p>
<p>This was a very pertinent speech.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Qi, like Mr. Wu, first apologized for not being able to speak Cantonese before elaborating on his grand theory: "We have received three proofs from the essay competition: first, it proves that Hong Kong's young students have a very correct understanding and advanced thinking; second, it proves that the cultural level of most Hong Kong students is above average; third, it proves that there are also many thoughtful and progressive women in Hong Kong. Through this, we know that some people's criticisms of Hong Kong students are misunderstandings and disdain.</p>
<p>"In the essays, we found that many people expressed dissatisfaction with the school and teachers. We especially hope that you will understand the difficulties of the school authorities in this environment. Do not be too eager to create a bad situation of opposition between teachers and students. It is best for students to unite and express their opinions to the school authorities in good faith to help the school develop..."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan used progressive facts to comfort the young students in Hong Kong and earnestly hoped that teachers and students would work together, which was naturally a moving speech.</p>
<p>After Mr. Lu reported on the essay competition, he translated the main points of the opinions of the previous gentlemen again! He also spoke eloquently about the Hong Kong environment and made another sincere and practical wish:</p>
<p>"Although some people in Hong Kong are living in licentiousness and shamelessness, we should work seriously. The rear and the front are equally important, and it is also necessary to leave some workers in Hong Kong to work. We must recognize and use this special environment to strive for Sino-British friendship to expand international publicity. We must strengthen self-education, provide theoretical support for saving the nation from the historical legacy of the nation and mankind and from the practical work of saving the nation as a guide for the action of saving the nation. We must constantly research, work, and practice, and apply the correct theory of saving the nation to practical work. We must especially overcome the past styles of formalism and headstrongness..."</p>
<p>The gentlemen of this newspaper said a lot, and it was rare for a guest, Mr. Yang Guohua, to propose "in this environment of living in a drunken dream, there is actually a new situation of the press and young students working hand in hand" under warm applause to encourage and encourage each other.</p>
<p>When the essay competition champion Zhang Dalian gave a speech, the serious atmosphere became tense and warm again. "We are very grateful to Shen Bao for its kindness to us, and we sincerely hope that Shen Bao will lead us..."</p>
<p>A calm and sincere speech ended under everyone's focused gaze. The warm applause broke through the surrounding silence.</p>
<p>It is a pity that this group of young friends is still a bit childish and shy, and they dare not say what they want to say in their hearts.</p>
<p>Receiving the Prizes and Starting on the Road to Success</p>
<p>The tea party began, and everyone chatted and laughed. Photographic commemoration, may our spirit always be together. As for the silver tripod and silver cup awarded to the second and third place winners, it is only a small token of respect in material terms. All twenty-five winners were awarded half a year of free subscriptions to this newspaper, and the common prizes made us feel a little more at peace in our hearts. We also place unlimited hope on the spiritual food of young friends.</p>
<p>Dear young friends: You are the most outstanding descendants of the Chinese nation. You have developed an interest in writing. If you have good habits in reading, you have grasped the important conditions for success. You must firmly believe in your self-confidence and move forward. The new China is looking forward to the growth of outstanding descendants who are striving forward! I wish you to receive the prizes and start on the road to success!</p>

<h3>Jockey Club Derby First Prize Winner Is a Wealthy Child: Lottery Ticket Stub Writes the Name of a Girl, Zhou Ruilian, the Boy Who Kept the Ticket Is Peng Liangjun</h3>
<p>The first prize of 240,000 yuan for the Hong Kong Jockey Club's Spring One-Dollar Derby lottery ticket was said to be won by four lucky children. The details have been published in this newspaper. However, who these four lucky children are was only learned after the reporter's investigation yesterday. One is Peng Guojun, one is Li Qingxiang, and one is Zhou Ruilian (female). As for the other one, the details are unknown. The lottery ticket stub of the Association uses Zhou Ruilian's name. As for the person who kept the lottery ticket, it is Peng Guojun. Peng is currently a student at St. Joseph's College and has several brothers. Peng is twenty-two years old and currently lives with his parents on Wong Nai Chung Road. His brother ××, it is said that it is ×××Shipping Agent of Foreign Trading Company, has made great progress in the industry in recent years and has obtained considerable assets. According to him, suddenly received a call from Peng Guojun from Golden Dragon Restaurant on Monday (28th) night, saying that he had won the first prize of the lottery ticket and was drinking and celebrating with friends at the restaurant. In the past few days, he has rarely been at home. Now he has driven out, and I (Peng ×× claims) do not know where he is now. My father is also waiting for him to come back to meet. Peng continued, "Speaking of one to two hundred thousand gold, our family already has it. It is not surprising that my younger brother has won sixty thousand gold." Therefore, I hope that Mr. Peng will follow the purpose of disaster relief and use this huge prize to do his best to solve the crisis and save those in distress, and benefit the poor overseas Chinese and the suffering compatriots who have fallen into a foreign land.</p>
<h3>After Demolition of Shantytowns in Peninsula, Thousands of Poor People Roam the Streets: Village Houses in Kowloon City and Shek Kip Mei, Etc., Are Crowded, Due to Livelihood Reasons, Many Poor People Are Unwilling to Go to Refugee Camps in the New Territories</h3>
<p>After the Hong Kong authorities ordered the demolition of the shantytowns in Guangdong Road and Tak Kok Tsui, Yau Ma Tei, and Tai Kok Tsui a few days ago, yesterday was the deadline for the Tai Kok Tsui area. Therefore, the police dispatched personnel to the scene to supervise the demolition yesterday morning. As a result, the shelters that thousands of poor people had managed to build after countless hardships had to be hastily evacuated. According to the authorities' instructions, they could request the authorities to take them into the refugee camps far from the urban area. However, these five or six thousand poor people are mostly coolies on the streets or other laborers with a monthly income of seventy or eighty yuan, and many families have many mouths to feed who rely on it for a living. If they leave the urban area once, it is tantamount to losing even this ten yuan. Try asking how they will maintain their future life, so although they want to obey the order to move, it is really impossible. Therefore, after the general poor people were ordered, they went to the small village houses in Kowloon City, Ngau Chi Wan, and Shek Kip Mei in Sham Shui Po to find small attics and small rooms for residence. In a few days, the above-mentioned village houses were rented out, and there was a shortage of people. Moreover, the rent was raised several times. In the past, the annual rent value of a small attic or small room in each village house was only about six or seven yuan, but now it costs four or five yuan a month, and there are still not many because the demand exceeds the supply. It is really impossible to accommodate these four or five thousand people. Yesterday, the reporter crossed the sea to investigate the poor areas and saw that the general poor people were only dismantling their shacks in a mess, retrieving the bamboo and wood raw materials that had been built with blood and sweat. Those who were fortunate enough to rent accommodation in Kowloon City and Shek Kip Mei and other villages had calmly moved away a few days ago, but this was only a small part of them. Most of them still had no place to stand and were at a loss. After sighing under the demolition of the shacks, they carried their sons and daughters, old and young, shouldered everything, and returned to the arcades of the streets to taste the taste of eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew again. The situation was very miserable. In addition, among these poor shantytowns, there were about ten who were refugees who had fled from the mainland and had requested the authorities to take them into the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp, but there were very few of them.</p>

<h3>× Attempts to Invade East Guangdong, × Planes and Ships Repeatedly Harass the East Guangdong Coast, Shelling Shenquan Caused No Losses to Us, Many Fishing Boats Were Burned and Plundered by ×, Shantou People's Hearts Are As Stable As Usual</h3>
<p>[Special News from Shantou] The invading × army has recently moved a large team to the east, attempting to invade the Huibo Heyuan area along both sides of the Dongjiang River. Therefore, in recent days, the Chaozhou-Shantou sea and land areas, Huizhou-Yang areas, and coastal × ships and × planes have transformed their movements to stir up trouble, hoping to contain the army and civilians of the Dongjiang River. On the 27th of last month, the × naval and air forces jointly harassed the Huilai-Lufeng Chaoyang coastal areas. It was learned that at about 9:00 am, three × ships suddenly sailed from the west to the sea off Shenquan Port and fired artillery shells at the shore. At the same time, two × planes assisted in the air and dropped five bombs in Shenquan. The × ships fired seven artillery shells, but they all missed the ground, and we suffered no losses. At 3:00 pm on the same day, three × ships suddenly came to the Lufeng sea and put down several speedboats to capture fishing boats. As a result, five fishing boats were looted by ×, and the lives and deaths of the fishermen are unknown. At about 3:00 pm, a × destroyer was found at the Chaoyang Dengtai, and the fishing boats fled one after another. Among them, two ships failed to escape and were set on fire and sunk on the spot by ×.</p>
<p>Another report said that on the 27th and 28th of last month, × ships often appeared on the sea off Chaozhou and Shantou. The Chaozhou Yanglongtoushan, lighthouse, Hedumen sea, Mayukou and other coastal areas all had × destroyers cruising and spying. At 12:30 on the 26th, a × plane flew in from the sea and circled over Shantou for about 20 minutes, and then flew to the Pingtuolin area. It did not drop bombs. Currently, the air raid in Shantou is slightly tense. The military organs are guarding against traitors from causing disturbance to public security, and the team is stepping up patrols day and night. People's hearts are still stable, and the market is also good.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang × Position, Our Divine Eagle Team Takes Action to Show Its Power, × Is So Scared That Faces Are Bloodless and They Flee One After Another, Plainclothes Team Night Attack on Heqing Annihilates Many ×</h3>
<p>[Special News from Jiangmen] The × army entrenched in Jiujiang has not dared to cause trouble for ten days, but our army team has decided to wait for the armies of all parties to gather before launching a counterattack. According to military news, our new air force's Divine Eagle team of twelve planes flew to the West River off the Sea of West from a certain place on the third day of the lunar New Year to reconnaissance the × army positions, and then flew to the vicinity of Jiujiang, circling several times and dropping many bombs on the × army positions. The position was destroyed, and the × army was caught off guard by our planes and was so frightened that their faces were bloodless and they fled one after another. After our planes dropped the bombs, they circled for another week before flapping their wings and flying back to their original defense. At that time, the citizens of Jiujiang learned that the planes were dropping bombs and were extremely happy. It was also learned that on the evening of February 25, our army's plainclothes team of several dozen people took advantage of the dark moonlight and went directly to Heping from Gulao and launched a counterattack against the × army. The × army was caught off guard, and our army beheaded and killed many of them. After our team completed its mission, they triumphantly returned to defense.</p>
<h3>No War in Huibo, Peace Restored: Rumors of × Invading Hualian and Demanding Peace Untrue; Both Areas Guarded by the East River Special Operations Detachment</h3>
<p>[Rapid News from Boluo] It was previously rumored that two divisions of × troops had been dispatched to the East River to reinforce and were planning to invade Huizhou and Boluo counties again. It was also reported that over five hundred remnant × infantry and artillery troops had launched another attack on Longhua Lianhe, engaging in fierce battles with our troops and militia. As a result, residents of Huiyang and Boluo became unsettled, leading to widespread rumors and spontaneous evacuation of citizens, causing extreme distress. Yesterday, the 27th, the reporter visited Liang, the general commander of the East River Special Operations Detachment, to inquire about the situation. General Commander Liang stated that in the Huizhou and Boluo areas, our regular army and guerrillas were diligently monitoring the × troops in the Dongguan and Zengcheng areas. According to repeated reconnaissance, although there were troop movements, the number of × troops had not increased. As for Longhua, it is garrisoned by our detachment (referring to the East River Special Operations Detachment), and the defenses of Lianhe are the responsibility of Bu Zhiyang and Lin Junsheng's units. The × troops have not dared to intrude. The rumors circulating outside are untrue. The reporter also spoke with responsible individuals from the local political and military coordination agencies, who confirmed that nothing of the sort had occurred. It has been verified that Longhua Lianhe, located in the lower reaches of the East River, is currently very peaceful. Only the ignorant men and women in Huizhou and Lianhe are creating unnecessary panic. The local authorities are now working to dispel rumors and reassure the public.</p>
<h3>Luo Fengxiang Organizes and Reorganizes the Guerrilla Forces in the Third District</h3>
<p>[Rapid News from Huiyang] Luo Fengxiang, commander of the Seventh Guerrilla District, has been newly appointed by Zhang Fakui, commander-in-chief of the Fourth War Zone, as the commander of the Third Guerrilla District's Younger Brother Column in the Fourth War Zone. After receiving the order, Luo completed the reorganization of his subordinate troops yesterday and issued a proclamation stating: "The Japanese invaders are increasingly aggressive, and disasters are frequently occurring. The fate of our nation hangs by a thread. The government bears this heavy responsibility and is deeply aware of the difficulties. It has been deeply considering and comprehensively planning all essential measures for national self-defense and resistance against Japan to achieve the goal of repelling the enemy and saving the nation. Since the counties of Huiyang and Boluo fell into enemy hands, the government, recognizing the current situation and to meet the needs, has incorporated a portion of the local forces into the Third Guerrilla District for centralized training and deployment. In the Huiyang area, there is Zhong Mengsu's First Battalion and Yang Weiquan's First Company. In the Boluo area, there is Chen Shinan's First Company. In addition, the remaining unorganized local forces will be temporarily sent back to await orders for deployment to ensure that the front and rear of the resistance are mutually supportive and consolidated. This command will implement these matters diligently and in accordance with the regulations. In addition to separate orders, this proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge. All members of the local forces who have not been organized and have been sent back should engage in farming and temporarily pursue their respective occupations. When necessary, they will be ordered to assemble. It is hoped that everyone will uphold the principle of sharing weal and woe, pay attention to local public safety at all times, and jointly maintain order and stability. This proclamation."</p>
<h3>Heshan Local Forces Launch Sudden Attack on × Troops; × Suffering Over a Hundred Casualties; Our Troops Withdraw Calmly</h3>
<p>(Rapid News from Heshan) The × troops' plan to bypass Heshan from Jiujiang and launch a flanking attack on our Gaohe and Gaoyao areas has failed to materialize. This is because our Sixty-fourth Army advanced from Sihui, trapping the × troops in a tight encirclement, rendering their delaying tactics ineffective. Additionally, due to the weakness of their forces in the Sanshui area, they were unable to implement their usual tactic of breaking through the center. Therefore, they were eager to seize strongholds to gain a foothold. Our troops and local forces in Heshan have taken strict precautions. The × troops attempted to cross the floating bridge at Jiujiang to attack Heshan and achieve their goal of flanking our forces. On the evening of the 27th of last month, our Heshan local forces dispatched the ×th Detachment, led by Commander "Big Fist," with over a hundred men, to lie in ambush in a certain area of Gubu. Taking the × troops by surprise at night, they launched a fierce attack. The × troops panicked and fought among themselves in the dark, resulting in over a hundred casualties. Our troops, having destroyed key parts of the floating bridge and achieved their objective, calmly withdrew. It has been verified that in addition to the casualties, the damage to the floating bridge was significant, rendering it unusable for the × troops to advance.</p>
<h3>Some × Cavalry Troops from Sanshui Withdraw to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Rapid News from the West River] More than four months have passed since the town of Hekou in Sanshui was occupied by the × troops. Despite repeated reinforcements and attempts to attack our positions at Mafang, Luju, and Ganggang, they have been repelled by our forces. Recently, our main forces have been transferred to the West River, with heavy troops stationed along the Jinli, Beishui, and Yong'an areas on both the north and south banks. At the same time, the front lines in Sihui and on both banks of the Yuhe River have also been fortified with strong defensive lines, confronting the × troops across the river, awaiting an opportunity to launch a general counter-offensive. The × troops, realizing the strength of our forces in the West River and the difficulty of invading, are merely building fortifications along the river and holding onto their existing strongholds, not daring to cross the line for months. On the 26th of last month, a portion of the × cavalry stationed in Sanshui city, about five hundred men, suddenly retreated along the Guang-San Road, stationing themselves in the areas of Wu Yan Qiao and Chou Bu Xu. It is said that this cavalry unit was ambushed by our guerrillas in the areas of Gantang and Sanjiang Xu a few days ago and suffered heavy losses. Therefore, they were withdrawn to the rear for rest and replenishment.</p>
<h3>Special Encouragement for Civilians with Guns to Join Self-Defense and Kill ×</h3>
<p>[Rapid News from Shaoguan] Li Hanshun, chairman of the provincial government, believing that the military development of the resistance war in the first phase has been re-adjusted politically, and considering that the people in various counties have not fully contributed their weapons to participate in killing ×, has specifically ordered the county magistrates to instruct the heads of districts, townships, and towns to promptly persuade civilians who possess self-defense weapons to hand over their weapons to the district, township, and town offices for registration and stamping, and to actively participate in self-defense groups and guerrilla forces, to be dispatched at any time to defend their villages.</p>
<h3>Special Shipping News</h3>
<p>The Guang Fu Xiang, a ship of the Ming Sheng Company, sailed to Macau yesterday. It is understood that due to damage, it needs to be docked for repairs. It is said that it will take about a week before it can continue sailing. Currently, the ship is docked at a shipyard in Sham Shui Po, awaiting repairs.</p>
<p>According to news from the French postal ship agent, the Bodoumei ship, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Saigon yesterday, has stopped its voyage as it is deemed unnecessary to come to Hong Kong. Also, the President Doumei of the company is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai at noon today and depart for Saigon, Shizhu, Masi and other places at 4 pm.</p>
<p>The Lian Hai, agented by the Prince's Company (formerly the "Haining" of the German Delis Company), is currently under repair at the Kowloon Dockyard. It is said that it will be completed within days and is scheduled to sail to the Philippines on the 4th, carrying more than a thousand tons of goods.</p>
<h3>Liu Houwu, Supervising Commissioner of the Control Yuan, Advocates Thrift Movement; Calls for Saving Time and Money for National Salvation; Continuing Hedonism Undermines Resistance</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Correspondence] Liu Houwu, a supervisory commissioner of the Central Control Yuan, after leaving Hong Kong, went to Shantou to inspect the political situation. Due to certain matters, he came to Shaoguan and strongly advocated a thrift movement to reporters, expressing his views as follows: "Our country is striving for national independence and the survival of the nation, rising up to engage in conflict with the violent ×. All our officials and civilians should unite and save time and money to overcome national difficulties together. Among the officials, gentry, and merchants in Chaozhou and Shantou, many are able to abide by the law and work diligently. However, there are also not a few who regard the resistance work as if it were unrelated, showing indifference. It is obvious that unnecessary social gatherings also cost hundreds of dollars, and they compete to drink foreign wine as a sign of pride. Little do they know that such pointless social gatherings are a waste of time and money, and that drinking foreign wine causes money to flow out of the country, which is even more inappropriate. Moreover, the thrift movement was advocated long ago during the New Life Movement, and the National Government has repeatedly issued orders, which all officials and civilians should abide by. Such a hedonistic lifestyle will only undermine the strength of the resistance. If social gatherings are indeed necessary, it is hoped that both hosts and guests will make every effort to economize to avoid wasting public funds and to strengthen the power of resistance."</p>
<h3>Returning from the Pingshan Guerrilla Area</h3>
<p>— Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>——Sketches of the Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force——</p>
<p>Embarking on a journey at dawn</p>
<p>On the morning after the New Year's Day of firecrackers and celebratory sounds, at dawn, we boarded the Guangzhou-Kowloon train. At this time, the gray sky still faintly held onto the lingering stars.</p>
<p>We were a comfort delegation from the Datong newspaper. Due to work and opportunity, the writer joined them. Our destination was the Hui-Bao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force in Pingshan. When the train reached Dadi'ao, it stopped due to the interruption of the "Big Wheel" bus heading to Shayu Chung. We had to walk to Dadi Market for an early meal before taking a bus to Shenzhen. From Shenzhen, we took a long-distance bus towards Zhonggang. The passengers were very crowded, but after only fifty minutes of driving, we had to start walking because the roads ahead were all damaged. However, what we saw along the way was only burned and small debris. The × could still drive if they made some minor repairs. It can be seen that the destruction was not thorough enough.</p>
<p>Passing by Gangbian, Gangbei, and reaching Longgang, it was already half-past noon. Longgang is a large market town. It was devastated and burned by the × in early October last year. The dilapidated buildings were heartbreaking. But the residents have gradually returned, but it still feels very deserted.</p>
<p>It still takes four hours to walk from Longgang to Pingshan. People were originally very tired and hungry, but they still marched bravely forward. Among them were several female workers and a female teacher who were also very vigorous, which was quite commendable.</p>
<p>Many places we passed had been occupied by the ×. The original atmosphere after the robbery has not recovered, and the rumors of re-invading the East River are on the rise again, and the situation is very tense. Therefore, in addition to strengthening military defense, the destruction of highways is better than the previous section. Many traps, square or long, were dug between the distances. If the ×'s armored forces or cavalry advance, they will be attacked.</p>
<p>In the evening breeze and wheat waves at dusk, tired steps began to step into the Pingshan guerrilla area. This is a rather large city near Danshui. The streets are still clean, and the residents are busy spending the year, so it is still very calm. The first thing that caught my attention was the slogans filled with the walls, all issued by the Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force and the Pingshan Anti-Japanese Comrades Association, etc., which made people very excited.</p>
<p>Extreme fatigue was driven away by a high degree of joy. We stepped into the guerrilla area.</p>
<p>They are the combatants who defend the East River</p>
<p>The Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force knew of our arrival in advance, so they lined up to meet us at the entrance.</p>
<p>Standing at attention, I first saw the pure and solemn heroic posture of the armed guerrilla warriors. I couldn't help but return a solemn smile. The place where we first arrived was originally Pingshan School, which is now the training institute of the Second Team. It is open, magnificent, and very quiet.</p>
<p>It has been less than three months since the emergence of the Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force. However, this active team, which enjoys a high reputation in the East River, has survived, advanced, and become an outstanding and progressive guerrilla force in this short period of time.</p>
<p>In early October last year, the × began to attack Guangdong and invade places such as Aotou, Danshui, and Pingshan, and the vast masses, under the leadership of the Huiqing Work Corps, launched a simple armed resistance. After a period of continuous struggle, they produced the prototype of the Hui-Bao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force. But at that time the number of people was only dozens, and the guns were only more than ten borrowed from Uncle Hai's brigade and seized from the ×. But the greater struggle is increasing. It's only been about three months now, and the number of people has skyrocketed to hundreds, hundreds of guns, and heavy machine guns, light machine guns, and mobile machine guns.</p>
<p>The rapid development shows that the loyal people's guerrillas are growing and developing in the struggle. It also shows that our war of resistance is progressing.</p>
<p>Because their actions have protected the faith and support of the broad masses of people, and further gained the trust and cooperation of friendly forces, and were officially approved for establishment by the government, its development has become even greater, and its own organization has also grown soundly.</p>
<p>In terms of the current political and military situation, no one denies the possibility that the × will invade and occupy the East River again. Therefore, the action to defend the East River should be urgent. How to truly mobilize the power of the masses to engage in the war of resistance under the cooperation of the military and the people is extremely urgent. The Hui-Bao People's Guerrilla Force is currently working towards this goal. At the same time, they are the combatants who defend the East River.</p>
<p>In terms of organization, they still adopt the three-three system of the army. They are now divided into three teams, each brigade having three companies, and each company having three platoons. There is also a special operations brigade, whose work is to be responsible for the machine gun company and political cadres. In order to meet actual environmental needs, a women's team was recently established, with about twenty people.</p>
<p>So far, they are still semi-independent, so the supply of military fire and life depends on the continuous assistance from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and sailors. There are now frequent comfort delegations from various community and worker organizations to comfort them. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Edgar Bergen Insures Charlie McCarthy – Insurance Amount is $5,000 –</h3>
<p>Eighteen years ago, a piece of ordinary, unremarkable pine wood was transformed into the face of a mischievous child by the artistic hands of Theodore Mack, a woodcarver in Chicago. Eighteen years later, that piece of wood has become the most valuable in the world, worth at least five thousand US dollars! This is the famous puppet Charlie McCarthy. He is truly a lucky "blockhead," unprecedented and, one dares to say, unparalleled. There is absolutely no second piece of wood like him because he is the real deal, a brand name, and no imitation is allowed.</p>
<p>However, recently Edgar Bergen - Charlie's manager - has spent thousands of dollars trying to create an identical Charlie. Edgar Bergen has no intention of abandoning Charlie. On the contrary, he is showing Charlie all the love in the world, finding him a double to perform in dangerous scenes. He has visited the best woodcarvers in the United States, but none of their works have satisfied him. He even made a plaster head mold of Charlie for carving, but the result was also a failure.</p>
<p>"I can't say exactly what the flaws are in those new faces. They look exactly like Charlie, down to the smallest detail, but they are not Charlie. Why can't a second face that is exactly the same represent the same person? ...... Unfortunately, Theodore Mack died several years ago. In other words, even if he were still alive, he might not be able to recreate his masterpiece.</p>
<p>Bergen doesn't need a second Charlie yet, but Charlie is in the new film 'You Cheat An Honest Man' and has to act for eight hours, and his co-star, the mischievous W.C. Fields, is always unreasonably picking fights with Charlie. This is extremely painful for Bergen. What if his little friend gets into trouble? Since a substitute is hard to find, he can only insure Charlie. After consultation, the insurance company has agreed to insure him for $5,000, and according to Bergen's intention, he would like to sign a $50,000 insurance policy.</p>
<p>Hollywood Tidbits</p>
<h3>Sonja Henie</h3>
<p>Sonja Henie is extremely annoyed. After each ice skating performance, there are always people waiting outside the backstage door, determined to ask her to dinner. Now she has a clever plan to ward them off. When she encounters this situation, she says, "Okay, as long as you can treat our entire company, I'd be very willing to go." This clever move often makes those self-proclaimed playboys retreat.</p>
<h3>Fredric March</h3>
<p>Fredric March recently discovered something incomprehensible while filming his new movie "Trade Winds." He noticed that the Japanese people's clothes, both men and women, were loose robes with large sleeves. So he asked a Japanese man next to him,</p>
<p>"Hey, when you all wear the same clothes, how do you tell men from women?"</p>
<p>"Really?" The Japanese man smiled slightly. "Let me ask you the same question. When you foreigners, both men and women, have short hair and wear trousers, how do you distinguish between men and women?"</p>
<p>The big star thought for a while and finally answered, very cleverly, "It's very simple. Just look at those carrying handbags. They are women."</p>
<h3>Charles Bickford</h3>
<p>Charles Bickford, a rough-and-tumble type who usually plays tough guys in movies, has suddenly softened up. This time he tore up a twenty-thousand-dollar contract and had a falling out with the great director Cecil B. DeMille because he refused to perform an extremely dangerous shot in "Union Pacific." He said, "Once in a Universal film, I was bitten by a lion, and as a result, I spent more than six months in the hospital. Another time, a piece of flesh weighing a pound was lost from my leg in the mouth of a carp. Isn't that enough? This time, they want me to hold a cigar in my mouth while Akim Tamiroff uses a twenty-five-foot whip to knock it off in one fell swoop. Forget it. It's not worth losing an eye, an ear, or a nose for twenty thousand dollars."</p>
<h3>Johnny Weissmuller</h3>
<p>Johnny Weissmuller, after a two-year hiatus, almost lost the opportunity to reprise his role as Tarzan upon returning to Hollywood. The story goes like this: One day, when he tried to make his world-famous Tarzan yell, the receiver was only able to pick up a very sharp high pitch, which wasn't very loud. The company was naturally dissatisfied. He himself said; it wasn't caused by the divorce from Lupe Velez, but rather by the lack of opportunities to practice climbing trees. But, he believes that within a short period of time, his past fierce and majestic roar can still be restored.</p>
<h3>Arthur Treacher</h3>
<p>This actor, like Edward Horton, is known for playing butlers on screen. Have you seen "Stolen Heaven"? The tall guy who follows Herbert Marshall is him. We may think he looks ugly, but he has always been proud of it, believing that there is no one taller than him among the current movie actors. This time he met a tough opponent. An Englishman named Lionel Brahm came to Hollywood, standing seven feet five inches tall, weighing two hundred and eighty pounds, and with a chest of fifty inches. He immediately dwarfed the skinny Arthur. But after a few days, he said again: "Okay, no matter what, my height is always the same as President Lincoln's."</p>
<h3>James Stewart</h3>
<p>Movie fans will see this star's new trick in the new film "Ice Follies of 1939." In the film, he was originally a skating expert, but once he broke his leg and could only do some light and easy comedic performances. Here he and Lew Ayres play a "skating horse" together. Lew Ayres plays the horse's head, and the rest is him.</p>
<h3>Jack Oakie</h3>
<p>He must have made a fortune somewhere and come back. Someone saw him signing a check for a hundred dollars in a public place and casually using it to light a cigar.</p>
<h3>Jack Haley</h3>
<p>Jack Haley is not only a famous comedian on screen, but also a great philanthropist. He often donates considerable sums to an orphanage, and this time, in addition to donating a full set of uniforms for the orphanage's music class, he also equipped them with many previously missing musical instruments.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple</h3>
<p>A time clock has been added to the 20th Century Fox studio. This matter once bothered Shirley Temple for a while. When this little star saw the children working with her in the same film, walking out and always going to punch the clock, she cried. Why can everyone else punch the clock and play, but she can't? No matter how the staff in the studio explained to her that because she was a red star with a weekly salary of more than a thousand dollars, she didn't need to be restricted by punching the clock to record her time, this could not make her feel relieved. She always regarded it as a happy and wonderful thing. In the end, there was no way to satisfy her wish, so the company set up another one for her, allowing her to punch the clock as much as she liked.</p>

<h3>Singapore Chinese Football Team to Depart Mid-Month; To Visit Hong Kong After the Philippines; Delegation of Eighteen People Elects Xu Houkun as Captain</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Although the Philippine team was defeated in all three games of the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Tournament held during the spring break, the lively scenes and wonderful performances left a deep impression on us. Now that the Interport Tournament has become a thing of the past, the football scene continues to be active in Hong Kong, this paradise. The new stimulation of football events is truly endless and never gets tiresome.</p>
<p>Let me tell you that the Singapore Chinese Football Team will be coming to Hong Kong at the end of this month. Yesterday, my friend Qi Gong received a letter from Xu Houkun, the captain of the team, detailing when the team would depart from Singapore for the Philippines, when they would travel from the Philippines to Hong Kong, and the list of all the team members. This new news should be welcomed by the readers, and I have to report it accordingly.</p>
<p>The delegation of eighteen people will nominate Deng Yuehan or Yan Jixiang as the leader, and Xu Houkun as the captain. It has been decided that they will depart from Singapore on the 13th of this month aboard the Victoria, an Italian ship, for the Philippines. There will be multiple games in the Philippines. After the matches are completed, they will move from the Philippines to Hong Kong on the 26th for three games. On April 1st, they will play against the South China Athletic Association team, on the 2nd against the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese team, and on the 5th, a joint Singapore-Hong Kong Chinese team will play against the military team. All games will be played at Jia Shan. It is assumed that the South China Athletic Association is responsible for hosting the Singapore team during this visit.</p>
<p>Xu sent an English letter, so the surnames of his team members have been translated according to what is known, totaling fourteen people. There are still four people whose translations may not be accurate, and there may be errors. (Playing Football as a Tai Sui)</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi's Recommendation to the Ministry of Education: Send an Art Troupe to Participate in the World Games, Followed by Performances in Various Countries After the Games; Chu Willing to Take on Preparatory Work for the National Games in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] China has decided to send two soccer teams to participate in the 12th World Games. Previously, Minyi sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education, requesting special attention to national defense and the organization of a martial arts troupe to perform at the games. The original telegram is recorded as follows for your consideration: To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education in Chongqing, Vice Ministers Yuan and Zhang, and forwarded to President Dai Jitao and Wang Rutang: The 12th World Games will be held in Finland next year. Our country should participate as usual. If it has been decided, preparations should begin immediately. Recalling the results of the previous participation, we lagged behind in various competitions. Fortunately, the martial arts performance was welcomed by foreigners, bringing much honor. This year, we should pay special attention to this, and the scope of all organizations and athletes should be expanded compared to the last time. The quality should be even more refined and substantial. Regarding Shanghai's responsibilities, if I am entrusted with them, I will do my best. I hope that with thorough preparation, we can gain international honor. Furthermore, the martial arts troupe can take this opportunity to perform in various countries after the games, to promote our country's inherent martial spirit, which is also conducive to propaganda for the war of resistance and national construction. I humbly submit my opinions for consideration and request a special reply by telegram. Respectfully, Chu Minyi.</p>

<h3>Dasheng Cup Volleyball Tournament Reorganizes Schedule</h3>
<p>The 1938 Dasheng Cup Volleyball Tournament, since the start of the competition, has largely determined the results of each team. However, due to the Lunar New Year, many players have left, making it difficult to gather them. Therefore, the competition has been quiet in recent weeks. It is reported that the organizers plan to convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss the future schedule of the competition for the teams that have not yet completed their matches. Therefore, it is hoped that the competition can continue this week.</p>
<h3>Equipment Performance Raises Over a Hundred Dollars, All Used to Purchase Medicine for the Front Lines</h3>
<p>The YMCA Fitness Group, feeling for the soldiers on the front lines fighting bravely for national survival and suffering injuries, and aware of the lack of medical supplies, initiated an equipment exercise performance to raise funds to purchase medicine for the front lines, fulfilling their national duty. The group started performing last month at the YMCA gymnasium, with excellent results. Ticket sales totaled $134.60. Yesterday, the group used all the funds to purchase Japanese medicine and handed it over to the Hong Kong Provincial Youth Military Service Corps to take to the front lines.</p>

<h3>Maharaja of Jodhpur Plans to Invite Three Tennis Stars to Perform in India; Negotiations on Remuneration Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>According to a communication from India on February 6, the Maharaja of Jodhpur plans to personally invite three world tennis stars, Budge, Vines, and Pan, to perform in India this year. He is currently seeking the consent of various authorities and negotiating remuneration. Once these matters are settled, he will contact the All India Lawn Tennis Association regarding the dates of the matches. It is said that the negotiations are proceeding smoothly. If this materializes, the three tennis stars may tour various cities in the Far East before arriving in India. It is unknown whether the Hong Kong Lawn Tennis Association is also preparing to invite them to perform in Hong Kong during their visit. Hong Kong has a history of inviting famous professional tennis players to perform, and we have seen performances by renowned players such as Vincent Richards, Ellsworth Vines, and Tilden. However, the world of tennis has advanced rapidly. Seeing the current three stars perform together would undoubtedly be refreshing. I sincerely hope that the Hong Kong tennis community will fulfill our expectations.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Triple Jump Training (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>(4) HO - Single-leg hop, STEP - Step jump, JVMP - Double-leg jump - Points to note</p>
<p>(1) HOP: When starting this, the body should maintain the posture of running. The heel should also touch the ground when taking off, but the toe should leave the ground first. The other knee should be raised high to naturally move the head forward. When the foot leaves the ground, the body and arms should maintain the movement of running. The distance between the two feet should not be too far, and the head should not be tilted backward. The right foot should still be behind the left knee. When the take-off force is about to be exhausted, raise the left knee again to move the left leg to the front. However, the left foot should still be behind the left knee; otherwise, when landing, the left foot will inevitably fall straight down. The right foot should naturally extend downward, the knee still slightly bent, and the arms extended forward to maintain balance. The left knee should be raised extremely high. When the left foot lands, the body should still be slightly forward, and the right foot should be lifted up behind, maintaining balance.</p>
<p>(2) Step: When striding, it is not advisable to go too high, about one-third of a single-leg hop. During the single-leg hop, make every effort to increase the distance and use the remaining momentum for the step. Then, focus all your energy on the final jump. The proportion is roughly 9-8-10 feet or so. At this time, the right leg leaves the ground first, the left knee is slightly bent, and the upper body is not bent. The right leg strides forward vigorously, and the left knee must not be raised high. The body should be extremely balanced. When the right knee is at the highest point of the stride, the right thigh should be parallel to the ground. The left foot should be behind and should not be raised too high. The heel of the right foot should touch the ground first, and the body should lean forward to increase the force of advance, so that you can continue to work hard for the long jump.</p>
<p>(3) Jnmp: When the left leg is parallel to the ground, it should not be raised too high, otherwise the body will not be able to balance or tilt backward, resulting in a reduction in distance to about 12 or 13 meters. If you can pay attention to this point on weekdays, so that there is no backward tilt, I believe you can get better results. Therefore, the triple jump and the long jump also have the same importance regarding this issue. When landing in the sandpit, the two feet should be extended forward as shown in Figure 1, and the hands should be behind to maintain balance. When the feet land in the sandpit, the upper body should be as shown in Figure 2, with both hands swinging forward and upward, and the waist and abdomen also using force to push the upper body forward to avoid tilting backward.</p>
<p>In summary, the first step in triple jump training is to pay attention to running speed. The second aspect is to pay attention to the continuous movement from the start of the run to the landing in the sandpit - within these two, there is constant movement, and there can be no slight pause. It is also necessary to use basic exercises as an aid, so that the increase in strength and the correct posture development are the starting points. (The End)</p>
<h3>Why Exercise Promotes Health</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that exercise can promote health, but most people do not know why exercise promotes health, the harms of various exercises, slow progress, and misconceptions about exercise.</p>
<p>To understand why exercise can promote health, you must first understand the true meaning of health. Health does not only refer to "no disease or pain," but also contains a sense of "beauty" and "strength."</p>
<p>In the physical aspect, the effects of exercise are nothing more than the following three: —</p>
<p>(1) Exercising Internal Organs — To make internal organs strong, the most important thing is to promote metabolism and make the circulation, respiration, and digestion systems function normally and actively. Metabolism has a mutual relationship with the circulation, respiration, and digestion systems. If the respiratory, circulatory, or digestive system is weakened, other systems and metabolism will inevitably become abnormal.</p>
<p>During exercise, the three systems that are most affected in the body are these three systems. We all know that the lungs absorb oxygen from the air, and then the circulatory system transports the gas to all parts of the body. The tissues of the body use oxygen to "burn" those "substances" that can generate energy. In this process, waste products are also produced, and carbon dioxide is one of them. Blood circulation transports oxygen to the exercising tissues or muscles on the one hand, and also transports carbon dioxide to the lungs on the other hand, and then the lungs expel it from the body.</p>
<p>When muscles exercise, the first phenomenon that occurs is the increase of carbon dioxide in the blood. There is a small part in the brain that has the most sensitive feeling to the chemical changes in the body - especially the chemical changes in the blood composition. When the blood contains a large amount of carbon dioxide, this sensitive part produces a reaction, issuing a special nerve stimulation. This stimulation can reach the heart and lungs, and also cause the entire body to produce various necessary exercise procedures)</p>
<p>During exercise, because it is necessary to expel carbon dioxide on the one hand, and also to supply a large amount of oxygen to the exercising muscles on the other hand, the required oxygen is eight times more than usual. The heart is also the same. Usually, the heart pumps out a certain amount of blood per minute. During exercise, the nerve stimulation from the central control part stimulates the heart, causing the blood passing through the heart to increase, and the speed of blood circulation can also be eight times faster than usual.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to this need, the heart accelerates its work on the one hand, and the pulse increases from 75 times per minute to more than 150 times. On the other hand, the heart also temporarily expands, increasing the amount of blood it pumps out. At the same time, the heart muscles must have strong elasticity. The greater the expansion of the heart muscles, the greater the ability to transport blood. Relying solely on heart expansion and heart rate increase is still not enough to meet the needs during exercise.</p>
<p>The parts that are most active or work most intensely during exercise should receive the most blood supply. The digestive system is not very active during exercise, so the blood supply is reduced. However, after exercise, the digestive system can not only restore its proper blood supply, but also accelerate the digestive function and absorb the nutrients of food as much as possible.</p>
<p>Exercise can also enhance the function of blood vessels. Because during exercise, active and intensely working tissues and muscles should receive a large supply of blood, the blood vessels in that area dilate to prepare for the transport of a large amount of blood. As for inactive parts, such as digestive organs, they can only receive a small supply of blood, so the blood vessels in that area contract. This expansion and contraction of blood vessels can make the function of the circulatory system normal and active. (1) (Replacing oxygen with O)</p>

<h3>On Movie Songs</h3>
<p>— Han Bo</p>
<p>Movie songs in China have only a short history of a few years, but the influence they have given to society is already extremely widespread.</p>
<p>The most significant gain is that movie songs have replaced dance songs in popularity among the people.</p>
<p>The songs we hear today in streets, schools, or organizations are no longer tunes like "Drizzling Rain" or "Peach Blossom River," but purely screen songs that emerge from sound films. In the sales statistics of record companies, dance song records are also far less numerous than movie song records. People not only love to sing movie songs, but also enjoy listening to their soundtracks. Even general song and dance troupes are largely abandoning outdated old dance tunes and using movie songs as performance scripts. Dance halls and broadcasting stations are even more strongholds of movie songs. All these facts demonstrate the remarkable position and profound influence of movie songs in Chinese society in recent years. Therefore, we place great expectations on current movie songs.</p>
<p>Because movie songs not only reflect the general social conditions but also sufficiently change individual thoughts and ideas. Music can indeed cultivate people, but it also depends on whether it is good music or bad music. Movie songs cultivate individuals and, from thousands of individuals, reflect a society's life consciousness. Her importance is also evident here. Thank you, Mr. Er, for laying the foundation for movie songs (and also the foundation of the entire music scene), leaving behind countless excellent songs. Those who inherit his artistic legacy have worked very hard and achieved great success, making the movie song industry shine brightly. However, since the Shanghai and Hong Kong film industries adopted a plan to mass-produce outdated films, this brilliance has been obscured by a group of people. Toxic films cannot keep up with progressive songs, and they need songs without the meaning of the times to match them. These songs influence individuals and, consequently, reflect a society without the symbols of the times. In this way, unconscious movie songs infiltrate people's hearts.</p>
<p>Music is a member of the cultural and artistic departments, and its power is by no means inferior to any other member. There are illiterate people in the world, but there is no one who cannot hum a tune. In the past, when we talked about culture and resistance, and strengthening the cultural front, we mostly focused on writing, neglecting music! Especially the importance of movie songs, which should be corrected. We demand that movie song writers, at a minimum, enrich the national consciousness of movie songs and consider the great role of movie songs. Within the scope allowed by the current situation, they should use metaphors, displays, or exciting and majestic sound forms to grasp the current reality, so as to effectively influence countless individuals and cultivate the entire society at the forefront of the times. Decadent music is absolutely unacceptable now. Current movie songs cannot be produced in small rooms alone; they also require a combination of subjective consciousness and objective environment. Movie song writers cannot despise their own position and the importance of the songs. Distorting the content and consciousness of the songs is no different from poisoning the masses, which is absolutely not what we expect.</p>
<h3>The Unknown Hero of Spain</h3>
<p>— Translated by Lü Jue Liang</p>
<p>You unknown hero,</p>
<p>Vanishing upon Spanish soil,</p>
<p>In that valley of blood,</p>
<p>You faithfully worked,</p>
<p>And bravely fought victorious battles,</p>
<p>For the wishes of all the people.</p>
<p>The commemorative beer that arose,</p>
<p>Has its head high, writing in the azure sky.</p>
<p>But now destruction rules everywhere,</p>
<p>And the sound of cannons is heard;</p>
<p>It will inscribe for you,</p>
<p>The words unknown hero.</p>
<p>Because of the suffering of mankind,</p>
<p>Your heart was shaken,</p>
<p>But for the attainment of freedom,</p>
<p>No one should be surprised and flustered,</p>
<p>Naturally, you rose up,</p>
<p>Stepping forward to face danger on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Ah, the life-taking gun,</p>
<p>Towards your steel-like chest;</p>
<p>The ruthless bullet teaches you to pick up,</p>
<p>Helpless fate,</p>
<p>Then, you are abandoned in the valley of blood,</p>
<p>Just when blood is being shed for war.</p>

<h3>Guessing Germany's "New Books"</h3>
<p>— Wang Yin</p>
<p>According to a report by the Haitong News Agency: Germany published the most new books in the world last year, totaling 25,400 volumes.</p>
<p>This is truly worthy of our envy, but it also makes us wonder: Since Germany became Hitler's world, we have only heard of the continuous burning of books, and the "number" of books destroyed is "the highest in the world." How can it suddenly produce so many books?</p>
<p>Naturally, the news clearly stated that they are "new books." If old ones are burned, new ones must be produced. That's right, very correct. But we can't help but ask again: What exactly are these 'new books' published in a year?</p>
<p>Although we live far away, we have roughly learned from telegrams what kind of books Germany burned in the past. Although the 'new books' published this time have not yet been described in terms of their categories, it is not difficult for us to guess a general idea.</p>
<p>Now, let me guess and try to give a statistical table of the categories of these 25,400 volumes of 'new books' as follows:</p>
<p>Praising Hitler and the National Socialist Party 13,000 volumes</p>
<p>Scolding Socialism and the Soviet Union 5,000 volumes</p>
<p>Telling Women to Return to the Kitchen 2,000 volumes</p>
<p>Talking about Austria being Germany 3,000 volumes</p>
<p>Saying that the Czech Republic must be protected by Germany 3,000 volumes</p>
<p>Pointing out that Jews are all bad guys 3,000 volumes</p>
<p>Discussing that Ukraine has 500,000 Germans 400 volumes</p>
<p>Total: 25,400 volumes</p>
<p>I dare say that my table is quite accurate.</p>
<p>But if you still want to ask: What is the "number" of readers of these books? That has become a difficult question to answer. However, we can guess a general idea. That is: When the "number" of readers is compared with the "number" of books, the phenomenon must also be "the highest in the world".</p>
<h3>Mountain Dwelling</h3>
<p>— Tang Yingwei</p>
<p>After running to a lonely island in the South, the past memories of my mountain dwelling always lingered in my mind.</p>
<p>The majestic peaks of the Great Kunlun Mountain stood high, overlooking the entire mountain city. What a small city! Who would have thought that I would live in this small city for a year.</p>
<p>It was the summer season, and the fields were filled with lush green rice seedlings. Diligent farmers bent their backs and worked under the sun. What a beautiful pastoral picture it was when I first stepped into the threshold of this mountain city. I thought so with praise.</p>
<p>After settling my luggage, I began my mountain dwelling life.</p>
<p>With a leisurely mood, I often wanted to explore this wilderness.</p>
<p>The morning light brought the crisp sound of mountain songs, the mooing of cows, and the shouts of farmers urging their cattle. All these sounds formed a rural symphony. In my drowsy sleep, I smiled.</p>
<p>Leaving the bird's nest-like lodging, I stepped on the footprints of cattle and slowly walked towards the fields.</p>
<p>"Sir, you must be from the provincial capital! The Japanese ×× planes haven't come again, have they?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't the ×× planes come? But we are not afraid of its bombs!"</p>
<p>The women working in the fields, seeing me, a stranger, slowly approaching, asked me questions out of concern for current affairs, not afraid of strangers, not afraid of Japanese bombs finding them. For the sake of life, they also had to come to this interior under the whip of life. But my answer was so contradictory!</p>
<p>—We should say that we are bringing culture to the countryside!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I felt the responsibility of cultural people coming to the countryside. But my first meeting with the farmers paid out a contradictory blank check.</p>
<p>A silent mountain dwelling, like a pool of stagnant water, as quiet as a grain of rice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, sitting in the house, I would occasionally feel lonely.</p>
<p>Let's throw a small stone into this stagnant water, perhaps it will stir up a ripple of excitement.</p>
<p>Because I am not a person who can shout before the masses, I have to use my hands and my thoughts to create pictures one after another, displayed before the public, as a tool for my advocacy. I thought: Utilizing the barren slopes of the mountains can increase agricultural production during the war. Holding an anti-war propaganda art exhibition in this quiet rural area can serve as a prelude to the literacy movement. It shouldn't be considered a waste of work!</p>
<p>Ideals often cannot provide people with the realization of reality. Farmers need quiet work and do not need floating struggles. They know that ×× is hateful, but they are happy if ×× doesn't come to trample on their hometowns—their wishes belong to the ideal, and when I use them as propaganda objects, I can't help but feel the indifference of the rural people's anti-war emotions.</p>
<p>A mountain city that has lost its soul!</p>
<p>A stagnant pool that cannot stir up ripples.</p>
<p>The distant north is filled with the smoke of war. The soldiers, braving the artillery fire of the × people, advance, treading on the bloodstains of the martyrs. We, a group living in the rear, in this atmosphere of stagnant water, have to relax our iron-tense mood. Let's pick up our guns and go to the mountains! Practice guerrilla warfare. Take the flying birds in the sky as × planes, and the sparrows on the branches as × people, surround, attack, and capture. In the twilight, we return singing the victory song of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Such a quiet mountain dwelling spent a year of my quiet life.</p>
<p>However, less than a few months after I left this mountain city, the × people had already invaded the threshold of this earthen city. Boom, boom, the sound of huge bombs awakened this group of people who loved peace. This mountain area is no longer a pool of stagnant water, but has long become a raging wave.</p>
<p>The farmers in the mountain city finally roared.</p>
<h3>The King of Chu</h3>
<p>— Li Zhiyi</p>
<p>Historical films are not a replication of history, so slight adaptations are permissible, and sometimes even necessary. However, this "permissible" or "necessary" should be based on a new historical perspective, using it selectively and critically. Otherwise, it would be like putting a cow's head on a horse's body, adding legs to a snake, or drawing a tiger and resembling a dog, which would be a joke.</p>
<p>Therefore, the difficulty of historical films (so-called "costume dramas") lies not only in the verification of costumes and props and the grandeur of the scenes, but also in the author's viewpoint. There will inevitably be the producer's subjectivity, and therefore it cannot be ambiguous. The editor who compiles news should be the most "objective." However, in the size of the headlines and the prominence of the position, he still cannot escape his likes and dislikes and the reflection of his awareness of certain news. As a work of art, can a film transcend worldly affairs and become a "third person"?</p>
<p>Therefore, our basic attitude towards the adaptation of historical films is not about how faithful to historical facts, but about how to use the standpoint of modern Chinese people to critically accept the lessons of history.</p>
<p>Regarding the theme of "The King of Chu," director Wang Cilong stated very clearly: "Because we want to make the story conform to modern trends, taking Xiang Yu and Liu Bang as examples, one advocates exhausting military force and reading military books, while the other advocates benevolence, righteousness, and peace. As a result, the former failed and the latter succeeded. This is the tragic theme of 'The King of Chu.'"</p>
<p>"Exhausting military force" and "benevolence, righteousness, and peace" are aimed at the current situation in China and the current situation in the world. "The benevolent prosper, and the hegemon perishes." This is originally an unchanging truth, but we still need to add a precise annotation to "advocating war" and "advocating peace." Otherwise, Yue Fei, who "advocated war," would become a sinner for thousands of years, while Qin Hui, who "advocated peace," would become a meritorious official for all ages. At a time when traitors like Wang Jingwei use selling out the country as an excuse for "peace," and Eastern fascists with mouths full of "kingly way" cannot step down from advocating war, and when everyone desperately seeks peace to protect their stolen goods, simply talking about "advocating war" and "advocating peace" in words is really in danger of becoming the "tail" of the aggressors. I think the original intention of the film's producers would not be like this.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding "peace" and "war," we should really look at it further.</p>
<p>After failing in "punishment" and despairing of "purification," the Eastern fascists' new policy implemented in the Jiangnan region is a policy of appeasement, which is also to buy people's hearts. The so-called policy of appeasement, when exposed, is really worthless. On the one hand, it instigates traitors to collect grain and other things through extortion and deception. Then, they come forward to transport a portion of the grain from area A to area B for disaster relief, pretending to be the "army of the king." On the surface, they are the masters of "benevolence, righteousness, and peace," but in reality? —Anyway, very few people know this trick.</p>
<p>And is such "benevolence, righteousness, and peace" truly "benevolence, righteousness, and peace"?</p>
<p>"The King of Chu" uses the victory of "benevolence, righteousness, and peace" and the failure of "exhausting military force" as its "dramatic theme." This is originally very good, but the pity lies precisely here. It only writes the surface and does not dissect it further, and this is not enough.</p>
<p>We sympathize with the producers' painstaking efforts, and we admire such a solemn dramatic theme. At the same time, precisely because of this time and place, we cannot but demand perfection to prevent abuses. —In case such a play flows into the occupied area for public performance, then such defects should be prevented even more.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, I would like to give an example to discuss it:</p>
<p>"After Xiang Yu advanced his army to Xianyang, he did not listen to the advice of the crowd, killed the Qin Prince Ziying, and slaughtered tens of thousands of people in Xianyang." Later, there was a scene on the screen of a woman attempting to assassinate the King in his tent. This scene is very important, and the woman's words are even more worthy of our attention. She said: "After the people overthrew the King of Qin, what they hoped for was an army of benevolence, righteousness, and peace. Who knew that as soon as the King arrived in Xianyang, he killed countless people... So the families of those who were killed formed an alliance, made into bayonets, and she entered the tent to attempt the assassination, in order to avenge the killed people..." (The general idea is like this). From the perspective of the dramatic theme, it does conform to the "dramatic theme" and shows that the people cannot be lightly humiliated. However, in our view, we feel that such a "dramatic theme" still needs to be given a clear indication. First, we should correctly and clearly indicate who the × people of the people are. Second, we must fix the × people. In this way, we will not mistakenly regard the violent and cruel × people as an army of benevolence, righteousness, and peace, and place hopes of appeasement on them. In this place, we can only emphasize the "dramatic theme" from the standpoint of today's Chinese people to warn the wavering, complacent, and backward people. If such a theme is not expressed clearly, it may lead to many misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, "The King of Chu" did not clearly and 100% achieve this.</p>
<p>In other respects, in the compilation of the script, it seems that because too much emphasis was placed on several key scenes, the transitional scenes were neglected, so that people had the feeling of watching a Peking Opera like "The Complete Chu-Han Contention," forming a continuous feeling of old plays. This is indeed because there is too much historical material, which is not easy to handle, but it is also because the playwright placed too much emphasis on the heroism of the King. History is not made by individuals. It is also a dangerous thing to overemphasize the individual and ignore his environment and evolution.</p>
<p>This may be because the playwright was influenced by Peking Opera (shooting costume dramas is difficult; how to jump out of the influence of Peking Opera is one of them), so in the division of scenes, he unconsciously created this. The same is true for the compilation of dialogues, the actors' movements, and the recitations.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong's King of Chu has his merits in his roughness, but his aura of strength to uproot mountains is not enough. Especially his posture on horseback, because of his insufficient physique, is even less able to depict this one-time hero. Jin Suqin's Yu Ji has few scenes, and perhaps because it is her first time on camera, she is not amazing. In terms of temperament, there also seem to be places for discussion among the other actors.</p>
<p>The most commendable aspect of this play is the grandeur of the scenes. From this point of view, it can be seen that no expense was spared. However, because the × people are not written clearly enough, although a great deal of money was spent, we still cannot feel completely satisfied.</p>
<p>Shooting costume dramas has its special advantages, which lie in alluding to the present through the past. From the perspective of the Chinese people in this time and place, "The King of Chu" is not satisfying enough.</p>
