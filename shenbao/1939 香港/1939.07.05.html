<p>現代青年　蔡元倍題</p>
<h3>建設我們的大學</h3>
<p>— 蘇琳</p>
<p>許多靑年因為家庭經濟關係，不能入校讀書，便感覺得苦悶，以為自己的前　無望了，因為這樣，便消極起來。</p>
<p>這樣是非常不對的，我們要學東西不一定是要跑到為有錢人而開的學校才能够學的，我們無論在那一個場所，那一個地方，都計够學到東西，都能够建立「我們的大學」，因為「社會就是我們的大學」啊，而且這個大學是「百樣具全」「無奇不有」·學不盡的好大學，比方，我們不能入學校讀　了，便跑到農村去耕種，我們可以利用這個耕種的機會，去研究怎樣墾植，怎樣改善農業，最好能够找到幾個朋友，成立一個小組去討論，研究；如果我們去學機械，也可以約幾個朋友，一塊兒去討論，研究，這樣比講空話的學校，「講而不做」的學校，多少會好些　！</p>
<p>我寫到這裏大約有一部份人都會發生疑問：「如果我不能去做機械或回鄉耕種，那麽我們便不是不能够去學習了嗎？」不，絕對不是，如果不能去做機械或耕種的時候，我們也不妨約了幾個朋友一塊兒去研究課本，最好研究救亡理論和政治書籍，這方面好雖然是非常好，不過，這方面學習到只能貢以給個人不能够貢献給國家，民族，我以為去參加社團更為好，因為有很多救亡團體。他們都是有開歌詠班，政治訓練班，游擊戰訓練班，座談會………我們總可以在這裏學習得很多的救亡理論。同時，我們也可以使社團裏面的詠隊，戲劇組，去公唱或公演籌款給前綫將士，或者組織慰勞隊慰勞場兵，慰勞難民，慰勞前綫將士……種種工作，另一方面又能够自巳本身學習得很多理論、另一方面又能够做一點為國家民族的工作，這不是一舉兩得嗎？</p>
<p>失學的，沒有讀書的靑年朋友們。請你們利用每一個場所，每一個地方，來建立「我們的大學」，去學習實用的高深的理論，和做很多的實際的救亡工作！</p>
<h3>科學與窮苦青年</h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>吾國今日事事需用科學一般人士皆以為科學與他種學問不同，必有敎師為之講授，有相當之設備以便實習，方能有門徑之可尋。於是社會遂認科學為貫埃化，與金錢問題有密切關係，一若窮苦靑年雖天性於科學極屬相近，對科學最感興趣者，徒以家境貧寒，竟無研求科學之機會，然就科學之歷史觀之，此等觀念亦不盡然。研求科學之機會，在富有之子弟固甚多，而貧寒之子弟亦非竟為金錢所限，不得登其堂而入其室，要在人之努力不懈，隨時隨地而用之耳。卽以英國之電學大家拉第而論，其幼年之時極為貧窘，在一化學室充僕役，而能勤學好問，時時從德偉敎授領敎，其後竟有驚動全世之貢獻，美國之大發明家愛迪生氏在科學上之發明，達福人類者，幾於人人皆知。而其始乃係窮苦之幼童，不能入學校肄業，恃沿街賣報以資餬口，其一耳為人所　，竟至終身聾瞆，凡讀其傳者，皆知其幼年顚連之狀况，而能一意以求科，學終能空前之成就為歷史上之偉人，由是觀之，法氏尙有可以向人領敎之便利，而愛氏並此亦無，之全恃個人之奮鬥，遂得有志竟成，嘗見美國有小雜貨店之商人，於暇時研究昆蟲成為有名之昆虫專家，著述等身。花園之園丁成為植物專家，後竟充任大學敎授，博物館中之僕役成為地　學古生物學專家，後竟為該館之高等技師，化學室之僕役成為化學專家，後任大學教授，此類之佳話不可勝數，歐美各國受科學之賜，其國內之大學及研究所固甚有功，而其　苦靑年由下層而奮鬥為助，亦實大也，吾國百年淸寒子弟今日方主張自學，其勿因環境困難，對於科學而趦趄哉！</p>
<h3>無綫電開鑿隧道</h3>
<p>— 茸人</p>
<p>磐山通道為近代建築上艱難的工程，但是為開謂鐵路，或理設水管，或建築防禦工事，隧道的需用日繁，凡鑿隧道需自兩端相對穿人，庶幾收事半功倍之效。然自兩端穿入，方向須極準確。否則不免有差以毫釐，謬以千里之虞。方向的測定，從前全賴測量儀器，測算旣不易，結果自不能十分完滿。現在有一種無線電定向器，足以引導工人在山中前進，不入歧途而自兩端同在一直線上相對前進。鑿山工人祇需循着通過山中無綿電向前進行。就可以達到目的地。這種方法可以減少不少鑿隧道的困難，美國佛羅稜斯河隧道，通過山嶺起伏的山脈上堅硬的花崗岩，長十三英里，為世界上最長的隧道。鑿山工人也曾利用無綿電為嚮導。自兩端穿入的工人在山中相遇的地點，參差僅千分之三十六英寸。其效用之大蓋可想見。利用無綫電引導工人在一直綫上開　隧道</p>
<h3>晨操</h3>
<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>——壯丁生活的片段</p>
<p>曙光劃開了暗夜的天。原野，就漸漸的變了顏色；樹葉，野草，都透露着淸晨的温柔氣息。</p>
<p>號音由晨風中播送開來，在沉靜的太空裏，更莊嚴而嘹　，每一個壯丁都被振奮得雄心勃然了。我們冒衝着濛濛的朝氣，跑進操場，奔向那迎風飄動的隊旗下。一夥兒　步，脚底下都發出：「沙刺…沙利…一的聲饗，煤渣路十被播起了黑灰，瀰漫漫的，把傍路的草地，灑上了一層黑粉。</p>
<p>「噓噓！噓！一又突然響起了一陣集合的口哨。</p>
<p>站立在隊旗下，一夥兒排列成一條長的隊伍：立正，看齊……隨着敎練官的雄壯的聲調，開始動作。循環式的行進，一次，二次，三次…然後，更興奮地，更緊張地、跑步，疾奔，臥倒，衝擊，再進而化整為零，集零為整</p>
<p>這些動作操練過後，就開始分成兩個敵對的集團，演習陣地戰，佈置游擊爾，擾亂×人的後方，和輔助正規軍反攻，一切智和力的運用，好像就是一個現實的戰况！</p>
<p>我們的紀律和動作的成績，幾乎可以等於正規軍隊；不過，我們不能自滿，因為我們都是現階段抗戰的預備隊，我們止有着復興民族，造成新中國的職責！要：更勇毅，更堅定，向着民族解放的　的去奮鬥！</p>
<p>興奮的一夥兒，於是更興奮了，揚起雄壯的歌喉，高唱著：「我們為了民埃生存的自由，不惜用我們的熱血，不惜用我們的頭顱，向着侵略者去　鬥！……」</p>
<p>這時候，隊伍帶着歌聲，莊嚴地走出操場，每個人看若這麽美麗的原野、，浴亦朝陽裏：心版上加厚了騵×的熱望。</p>
<h3>華僑是革命之母</h3>
<p>— 游激</p>
<p>紀惠陽各界歡迎鐘代表大會</p>
<p>為拯救祖國而奔走呼號的甬洋華僑代表鍾醇生先生，率領靑年僑胞七十餘人，囘國服務，在十月九日到了惠州。</p>
<p>十日那天，惠州各救亡團體，如惠陽靑年抗×會，廣東靑年抗日先鋒隊，惠陽兒童工作國，難童敎養院，華僑囘鄉服務團，省賬濟會，舉行聯合歡迎。這是空前的盛會，這是刦後的惠州一次大　鬧！</p>
<p>這一羣中華民族優秀的子孫，復仇的烽火燃神了他們每個人的熱血，為了要達到復仇的目的，他們願把這滿腔沸騰著的熱血，揮洒在祖國的領土七。所以他們拋棄了「蕉雨潤，椰風凉」的南洋，拋棄了温柔美滿的家庭，優裕的生活，堅决地跑囘祖國的疆場上，準備和×人搏鬥！</p>
<p>在革命的歷史上，華僑是有着他光榮的史跡的，總理革命偉業的成功，得到華僑助力的確也不小。所以，總理說：一華僑是革命之母」！</p>
<p>在這次神聖的民埃革命戰爭中，華僑也盡了他有光榮歷史的偉大責任，許多靑年男女僑胞躍躍的囘來祖國，參加前線殺×，救護和後方的賑濟，宣傳等工作，成批的飛行員，大批的機器工人也囘來了祖國，參加國防工業或前線遝輸……等工作。總之，在抗戰每個部門中，都有華僑的成份在內。尤其是在經濟方面，更是如春泉的汹湧，不斷地援助祖國，這證明了，華僑是怎樣愛護祖國啊！</p>
<p>在大會中，鍾先生報吿了許多華僑愛國的寶貴的事實給我們，他說：「吉隆坡隊，這次囘國服務是空前偉大的，過去雖有許多僑胞囘國服務，但是都是個別的，而這一次却是大集團的，所以引起了僑胞們的同情，更引起了國際人士的同情，同時，也引起了×人，漢奸的注意！</p>
<p>「當我們離開吉隆坡的時候，在車上碰著一位沒有國籍的猶太人，他受了我們愛國熱情的感動，竟自願解囊捐助二百元。當我們要離開新加坡時，碼頭上擁滿了成千成萬的僑胞，築成一事肉的城牆，揚起了無數的鐵臂，熱烈的歡送我們。在海洋的歸途上，我們忽然接到了英國政府拍來的電說；×人要在瓊州海口截住檢査，這是由船中告訴我的。後來，我們就改變了航線才安全的抵達香港。」這證明了；一方面侵略者，用盡那無恥的手段，想要消滅我們各種抗日力量，另一方面，是我們這次為正義為和平的反侵略戰爭，是博得世界愛好和平的人士廣大同情妁！</p>
<p>他還講了一個令人感激流淚的故事：他老人家這次囘到南洋的特候，備受關心祖國的僑胞歡迎，請他講演祖國抗戰的形勢，尤其是他親眼所見到的束江。——受×人蹂躪後的東江的災情，當他講到惠陽無數難童無家可歸，無衣無食的慘痛事實時，全場的僑胞老年人，靑年，兒童部感動得流淚了。全堂嗚咽着，華僑對祖國受難的同胞是多麽同情啊！鍾先生有一句：「我這次囘來祖國，沒有甚　帶給大家，只有一百七十多萬的僑胞共有一個熱烘烘的同情心帶給大家！」這是多麽懇切，多麽感動人的說話啊：</p>
<p>同時他（鍾先生）在南洋時，各方面去進行着募捐，有一天走到一個山巴去收那已捐下來的錢，剛好碰着一個從山巴裹出來買米菜的僑胞，他曾經答應，捐助一塊錢的，當鍾先生見到他的時候，他竟兩面通紅起來，而急忙的將手裏拿着的一個紙包，一層一層的解開來露出來只有一塊錢，他拿了這一塊錢交給鍾先生了。這樣他米菜也買不成了，便逕自囘到山巴裏去了。啊！華僑這種愛國的熱情，多麽令人感動呀，他們為了要保衡祖國，為了不願做奴隸，而願口　吃的飯，身上穿的衣，甚至他們的生命都貢献給國家民族的。他們這種挨凍抵餒的精神，毀家杼難的精神，是多麽令人欽敬呀，我們在祖國的民衆，應該加何去以血肉來捍衛祖國，用行動來答謝熱愛祖國的僑胞啊！</p>
<p>最後鍾先生還說：「這次常我們發出「囘國服務」的號召時，就只馬來亞一個地方，就有三百多靑年踴躍的參加，經過考選後，取得了七十三名。我們當時的投選，並不是用據考科舉的方法來考取的，只用口頭問幾句很簡單話：（一）怕不怕死？（二）能够吃苦耐苦嗎？（三）再囘南洋來嗎？諸如此類。經揀選到的這七十三個，都是很英勇的熱血靑年，而且這裏面多數在南洋時曾經幹過　轟烈烈的救。工作的，如根絕仇貸運動，割漢奸們的耳朵，這都是很偉大很壯烈的事實」，誰說華僑在外國只是出錢而已。</p>
<p>「現在南洋僑胞正以遊藝的方式舉行籌欵，遊藝會是發入場券的，每張券有三四　的，拾元五元的，甚至有幾千元一張的，每次的遊藝會，可以籌得數萬元，尤其是値得揚的讀，就是在舊曆新年大人給小孩的紅包也都捐助出來了」總之，華僑為着愛護祖國是用各種各樣的方式籌欵帮助抗戰，華僑這種愛國的熱情是光榮的，是偉大的。</p>
<p>最後拿總理的話結束了這篇文：</p>
<p>「華僑是革命之母」！</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>德日侵者的東西應呼</h3>
<p>近日來歐洲和遠東發生兩種性質相同而且彼此之間具有聯繫的趨向：其一是德國軍隊在但澤的積極佈置：其一是日本陸軍在外蒙邊境的蠢然妄動。在蒙偽邊境上日偽向蘇聯的進攻已不止一次，這次竟又大規模發動飛機向蘇蒙挑戰，雖屢次失敗猶不肯收場。據長春外訊，在偽滿外蒙邊界上。日事集結漸多，蓄意滋事，糾紛日甚。日本且又運用過去的故技·宣傳蘇蒙軍隊如何大規模進攻將軍廟，現在隨時隨地時都有戰事發生，用為進攻蘇聯的口實。日本當此侵華軍事停頓時竟向蘇聯進擊，絕對不是偶然的。緣因歐洲方面，德國納粹軍隊與國社黨員，在但澤布置巳漸就緒，但澤實質上已成了戰時的情景。但澤凡合入伍年齡者已全部入伍，並穿着德國軍吸招　於市上。各營房皆已充滿了軍隊，舊營房和舊炮台也都忙於改建。另一方面又由德國的喇叭管，駐但澤的德政務委員霍爾士打，在納粹地方黨部成立紀念日，放出空氣，謂：但澤人民願歸併於德國，且不久卽可實行歸併。東西兩個侵略者正準備着吃他們幻想的甜頭了！</p>
<p>然而這個甜頭或許不會再那麼好吃了。納粹東征十軍過去的好夢，這次或將碰到波蘭這塊紏脚石而跌倒罷！在納粹東征十字軍的覬覦之下，波蘭不但已决心抵抗到底，並且已經積極準備對侵略者迎頭痛擊。另方面，英法對於波蘭的保障，卽波蘭自己也有堅信：「德國如實行以武力改變但澤的政治地位，則英法兩國必起而干涉」。「波蘭政府機關報轉載倫敦及巴黎的消息」。各報又都褐載英法艦隊將開赴北海基尼亞港的消息。波蘭幷已公開宣稱：『倘德國要戰爭，吾人也不避與一戰」。</p>
<p>在遠東方面，日本侵略者適應着希特勒有計劃的要求，海軍在華南各地積極蠢動，　　　　　？　　　　，對蘇聯則由陸軍發動進攻，南化的狼奔豕突，徒然暴露出囘光返照的弱點，其前途障碍之多，遠甚於德國之東進。</p>
<p>不過，這裏應認識的一點，就是東西兩侵略者的妄動，具有一個共通的目標，卽威壓英國，取東西牽制的形勢。英國當此時候，要深刻了解的是東方侵略者的威脅的作用大於歐洲侵略者。英國倘若對東方的侵略者屈服，則其影響當不只限於遠東權益之喪失，旦將增强西方侵略者的胆量。英國為今之計，只有對東方侵略者表示强硬，倘其包圍和封鎖日益加緊，則應採具體而有效的辦法衝破它　　　　的日本侵畧者，欲同時應付英法蘇及中國，是難中的難，卽令這個衝突還只限於局部。退一步想。英國對日本的種種無理的要求，儘可以置置不理。倘若英國答應一種日方的要求，足以妨碍中國的抗戰，則日本將更得寸進尺，英國在遠東將無立足之地了。</p>

<h3>綏遠弧線上</h3>
<p>— 克諾</p>
<p>【民革社通訊】假如我們在綏遠比咬廣大而詳明的地圖上，從包頭西北幾百學河套區域的五原起渡過黃河，經伊克昭豐北部頂端和　頭接境的達拉特旗並包刮包明的四區，再往東到達托縣隔　對岸的一部分士地，迤　往南至準葛爾王，更東馳至淸水河，可以割成一條不很整　的弧綿。</p>
<p>在這里，可以很明顯的看出；</p>
<p>（一）散布在綏遠的眞正×軍，祇有三千多，加上偽德王李守信指種下不穩的偽軍一萬人，在我各游擊根據地的帝制之下，是不會調來更多的兵力，平日　境×軍，就是顧此失彼，這次更繼得張惶，</p>
<p>（二）我駐在這條孤線上的軍隊，實力甚雄厚，在黃河冰陳防期，×人尙不可藉學冰運輸彈藥，兵器，目前黃河浩浩蕩，波浪滔天，×不來犯重已，如果冒險來犯，定遭並布置天羅地網的兵力，各個打得粉碎，恐怕連個退格也沒有，</p>
<p>尤其是自傅作義將軍率部踏進緩西以後，我軍的聲勢，更為浩蕩，政治軍事以某地為中心，正向×人頭上猛烈擊去。</p>
<p>轉過頭來，我們再說弧綫的束半叚：不特準葛爾旗東勝在我掌握中，就是那托縣一部份和薩縣河南岸的土地也都在我戰士的堅强固守中。×人　佔領縣城，此外為×佔有的祇沙　營了，叚家海了，大成西　口等地，然而在我　東游　支　的預極下，已成混　狀態，——我軍游擊範圍，鐵咯破壞橋，橋　被截擊，大大小小的勝利，興裹着週圍的民衆……</p>
<p>這條不很整齊的弧綫，已成為我抗戰的堡壘</p>
<h3>蝦蟆想食天鵝肉（上）　日軍誘脅我講和</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>日　貿然發動侵略戰爭之初，夜郞自大，神氣活現，滿以為數月內卽可使我國屈膝』，今戰事已延長兩年，而結來尙遙遙無期；加以我南北各綫之抗戰，愈打愈顯其堅强，國際局勢之演變，愈來愈對日本不利——日閥急內虛，焦跺萬分，便想由我民衆精神方面，施展陰謀詭計，卽在晉陜各地及黃河防線，散備許多花花綠綠的傳單：不是造謠威嚇，便是什言引誘，平白睜着眼睛說夢話，目的全在嗾使我戰區民衆，向政府請顧，快與牠們這些自以為，仁至義盡一日閥講和　可惜笨手脚玩不出好把戲那些傳單十所繪寫著的圖文，醜態百事，笑話連篇，眞不怕丟盡武士道的臉，笑破天下人的肚皮　計予不信，請看下文：</p>
<p>無聊傳單之可笑</p>
<p>×人由飛機散佈在山西的　單，有一張是：在一幅中國地圖的若　城巿上，貼着很多狗皮　藥，幷加註說：「在南京等地堝設親日防共新政府，製造安居樂業之新天地，百姓們，急速脫離×××，歸順新政府，共度幸福的新生活（？）。」</p>
<p>一個老百姓，正是你單中不度德不量力所稱呼著的『百姓們』，他曾憤憤然指著那樣的一張傳單對記者說：『無論它說得怎樣的天花亂　，但我二看見那些日本××就怪生氣　』</p>
<p>×軍幷利用偽「臨時政府」的名義，另散有關於用偽　套取我中，中，交　銀行法幣的傳單，先則好像求爺告娘，把『人民諸君』幾乎要捧上大堂：後則半呑半吐，說出他們在在打法幣的主意：如云：『於是「政府」遂採取人民諸君不受不測損失之措置……』不惜血本拍賣，將偽幣人打折扣，騙「人民諸君」用法幣去掉用偽幣。這稱妄想之離實現，誠如山西「人民諸君」說的：要生要馬，不送去好被趕去奪去，難道幾強薄紙（法幣），我們還愁沒安放處不成！</p>
<p>×人想擾亂我金融，在失陷區還賣出一種發幣，是明冶年間的假硬幣，上面已打有作發的字樣，可是現在復自欺欺人地使用出來。起初是以塊當二元的標準，强迫我同胞收受。未幾，狡獪的×人，又把它收囘去，利用漢奸，秘密向各處活動，一塊假幣，以上數元之價，復强迫銷于我同胞謂可當作「通行證」，或『護身符』用。不料後來被×人搜獲此幣者，又誣為我方便衣隊，非刑拷打。逼　重金贖罪。可是怪去怪來，只　法幣不是會飛的靑　。早自動飛入×人的荷包　，以免有勞武士多用手術。這當然與十述傳單所謂『於是「政府」遂採取「人民諸君」不受不測損失之措置』的用意，大有異曲同工之妙。</p>
<p>另有一張傳單，造謠更造的匪夷所思：「緬甸公路運輸，為空軍破壞！」緬　現為英國屬地，所謂破堜她的公路的空軍，不知是那一國的？說是它一大日本的，諒它不敢；說是英國自己的，更無此理。傳單僅如老太婆罵街般禿頭禿腦的咀咒一番，眞令人莫測高深！</p>
<p>又結束快到一年的張鼓　事件，蘇日兩國的軍隊，究竟是准向誰作揖吿饒？差不多已成為全世界婦儒皆知的事實了。可是，無　的宣傳家，至今它還抱住那次戰事產生下來的癩剩頭兒子在誇耀：「日軍同赤軍大戰於張最峯，赤軍大敗，機械化部隊劣弱性暴露！」在寫着這樣標語的傳單上，還繪形繪色地畫着蘇軍敗續的難堪情狀。乖乖，這不是在扮演掩日盜鈴的滑稽劇麽？</p>
<p>另有幾種石印彩色　盡，內容也是非常的荒謬。例如有福鐘　驅逐　　區，自炫日本之偽略中國，是一位了不得的替天行道的大仙，反之，凡是中國抗戰的民族英雄，便被形容成是些　眉綠眼的鬼邪，哈哈！這拿去欺騙日本小學生，許能再榨取些糖萬錢，而今却誤用于對我民衆來官傳，寧不等於當着兒面罵老子麽？父仇不共戴天，不是更將增加了我民衆的敵愾心裏？</p>
<p>這一類大　石印彩色書，大　代價相當的貴，所以在　的邊　寫着將此傳單揭下者，予以嚴訓，决不寬貸，一然而這些字習終被我英勇軍民，見一張，揭一張，幷紛紛傳到後方來做談笑資料。</p>
<p>不知所云的佈告</p>
<p>還有所謂「太原駐在大日本陸軍特務機關長谷荻那華雄一出的皇呈佈吿，尤具在銜上蓋着那大顆，九個宇的紅印　面料之人，印色之艷，眞　　金邊紅漆××蓋柑娩美。大概　位沐猴而冠的特務長有點兒誤會，誤會電皇皇佈吿之有照效力，全看那　紅印面職之大小，色料之濃淡以為定，然而這都不在話下，好東西，還在那佈吿里面：</p>
<p>『査本省政治，日十軌道……一切抗日份子，雖如何　　擾亂，恐亦無補大局。』一面百誇政治日上軌道，一面又說抗日份子繼續擾亂，幷用「恐亦」疑問口吻展望大局，這顯然在自已打目已的嘴巴。下文又說：「希望合作者，應向其就近軍政當局宣誓，表示竭誠擁護新政權，打到國共兩黨及忠實親日！一其文法之妙，眞不可言傳；因忠實親日份子，亦在打倒之列也。</p>
<p>另有一個自稱「在榆次大日本軍司令官」出的佈吿，只謂先把間著「在榆次大日本」數宇拿去和前者「太原駐在大日本」文法　量一下，就可知道二公同是一邱之貉。這佈吿的題目是：「吿因蔣的偽瞞政策私　虐非人道的行為在戰慄飢寒的山西省內軍民」，其費解之處，眞可絞昏人的腦汁：至其內容之精釆，更堪在侵略文學中聞一新紀元！如云：　（未完）</p>

<p>昨天晚報載，蒙偽戰事有擴大勢，蘇聯依照互助協定，實行援助外蒙抵抗日×挑釁，我華北各軍，以××軍為中心，展開反攻，東北四省游擊戰鬥亦加緊進行。這個消息如果可靠，對於抗戰，自然有利的。日×侵華兵力原已不足，今若因對國際裝空做態，「實行反蘇」，而致弄假成眞，脫身不得，則縱非全部覆沒，而增援北方結果。則南方戰場，卽將空虛！</p>
<p>不過我們要認淸日×勢必極力避免北方的大戰，目前挑釁祗是對英談判前的陰謀活動，祗是汪逆進組偽府前的陰謀活動，因此我們千萬不要太大意了！我們要準備迎接×人的跳躍作戰，我們要加緊華中華，南尤其是×人後方的反攻！</p>

<h3>但澤與世界和平</h3>
<p>— 董平</p>
<p>此文原作者羅許林博士，為前任但澤自由市參議長；一九三四年十一月卸任，現仍為納粹要員。論及但澤問題，頗具卓見，决非福斯特為里斯之流可比。而且，自此文中，當可見公道自在人心。更非希特勒能一手掩盡者也。</p>
<p>但澤問題，是可以好好地解决的。一個公平的解决，足以决定歐洲的和平不過，在進行解决之先，有關各方面，必須提出友好的保證。</p>
<p>在希特勒上台之前，但澤局勢，曾經呈顯過良好的現象，如果納粹不登台，但澤也許早已還給了德國；因為那時的歐洲，一定在軍總會議與和平條約之下，奠定互相合作的基礎，但是，現在最大的困雞，就是歐洲已成了軍備競爭場和互相仇視的地方了。</p>
<p>的確的，在大戰之前，但澤是屬於德國的；並且，曾經這樣統治過好幾世紀。但是，另一件事實，也不能忽視；當但澤屬於德國，和普魯士的時候，波蘭這個國家，未同時存在；自然，　用不着要但澤來作為海口，在那時候，波蘭這塊地方，大部隸於俄國，俄國自有其出入海口，當然也不必要選自由市。但是，大戰之後，波蘭正式建立起來，她自然便須要一個海口。</p>
<p>不論自地理上或政洽上觀察，但澤終是一個整體，德國與波蘭根本不能把它分拆，因為那種分拆。不但不能有益於和平，而且更益引起雙方的爆炸</p>
<p>不淪大衆的日耳曼人如何企望歸併德國，但是。重要的是：但澤如果淪入帝國主義的納粹手中，但澤一定成為德國一個重要的海軍根據地，那將令波蘭唯一的在幾尼亞的海口，　到根本毀滅，使波蘭入海之路。完全阻斷最後，更將使波蘭走廊被逼出議。如此，實無異瓜分了波蘭國土，斷絕了波蘭在世界舞台上的前程。</p>
<p>所以，希特勒的政治乎段，是最不適宜於解决但澤問題，一直到今天，他的政策，仍是一味要自由市併入德國，理由是但澤已經日耳曼化了。但是，自他佔領勃拉格之後，這個理由，已經不夠正確</p>
<p>幾年前，我曾獲得機會，聆取元首親自解釋東進政策——所　東面空間。那便是，德國要在東面統冶一串半自主的國家，用政治與軍事聯盟去控制她們，她們必須作為德國濟經與政治機構的咐庸與擁護者德國農村完全自各外國獲得勞力，而一般精工則由德國人民分派出去担任，這樣，以高上的德國人民。去統治低下半自主國人民，才能獲得東歐的永久秩序與和平。這些半自主的國家，包括波羅的海諸國，波蘭，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，匈牙利，和當時的捷克。這是一個表面類似國聯的政體，完全在德國寡頭統治之下；巳成了希特勒的外交的政治路綫。而且自摩拉維亞及波希米亞成立保護邦之後，這個計劃，更見逐漸展開。</p>
<p>對於這種理論，希特勒是完全同意的，不過，對邊彊各國，他會略加修芷。他說，應當把邊疆各國的人工移開，好讓德國農民前往移殖，同時，他提出摩拉維亞，波希米亞，堡米里尼亞，波甲。上西西里亞，都是極重要的地帶，而立陶宛及波羅的海諸國，希特勒則認為比較容易控制。</p>
<p>這個計劃，便是希特勒要求歸併但澤，和要在波蘭走廊建築公路的眞正背景，他的眞實目的，并非一個但澤自由市，而是為了執行整個征服計劃，毀滅東境唯一的強國波蘭是必要的，波蘭必須跌到一個中等國家的地位，成為一　一千五百萬人口的士地，希特勒在　告德國人民時，早已說過：德國必須盡一切可能方法，阻止其東境產生另一個軍事列強。在軍事因素上，打倒波蘭，是德國目下要求最主　，最急切的目的，</p>
<p>這些計劃，有一些德國人，自然很熱烈稱道。但以整個民衆來說，實在并不感覺興趣。他們反對向其他國家及人民，潘加壓力，因為這種計劃的結果，實在就是東歐的末日，這也許可以作為歐洲國家過於繁雜的補救，但是方法實在太不台乎文明之道了，它完全基於武力興　迫。</p>
<p>現在，我們不能不老實承認，全世界的國家與人民對於國家主義的爭鬧，都巳　厭倦了。現在，正是一個重新建立國際秩序的良好時候，那種秩序，過去的國聯盟與消極的集體安全，僅僅完成了第一步。唯一足以阻止納粹主義武力進逼的方法，便是共仝宣佈尊重，一些小國家的獨立自主權。以一個歐洲國家的聯邦組織，基於自由與團結，必能抵　希特勒的武力統治。</p>
<p>六年以來，歐洲不斷紊亂，完全由於希特勒政策的危險，一切與德國　結的條約，不但不能解决糾紛，反成為雙方衝突的導火線，卽令但澤問題，現在能暫告解决，那也不過是　未來安下一　導火線，而且，這次一解决一與下次爆發問的距離，最長不會超過六個月。</p>

<h3>嚮導秘密　我是一個嚮導女</h3>
<p>說起來我是怎麽做了嚮導女？這裏面，我可上了一個不大不小的當。以前，我是在人家屋裏，幫忙做工——說實話，我以前是個女僕，不過，因為「女僕」這名目，太不雅，並且，失身份。所以，現在，不是在挺知已的像你們這樣的人面前，我絕對，不肯說出我以前的歷史。</p>
<p>也許，我是像人們批貶我的，「生性風流」吧！帮過幾家，都是，不久就被女東家辭歇了。理由總是說我來往的男朋友太多，其實，誰不知道她們那些窄心眼兒，還不為的是，另東家多看了我幾眼，她們就酸起來，下此毒手啦</p>
<p>為了不願意受這些氣，我倚仗著幼時也念過幾本書，我就想另找一點高尙的工作，當時，有幾個朋友，就介紹我去當嚮導女，我問他們，這是不是一件「高尙」的工作？他們說了很多話，我也配不淸是些什麽話了，反正，百句總一句，嚮導女，是再「高尙」不過的職業了。這，還不能打動我的心，後來，一句話，使我死心塌地的願意當嚮導女啦。你們知道，是什麽話？他們說：嚮導的事，在『外國」不知多發達，還不算「高尙」嗎？對，外國人做的事，我想總是「高尙」的。這樣，我就做了嚮導女。</p>
<p>我們嚮導社出門「嚮導」的規矩，是一塊錢一點鐘，可是，客人們多半不「敢」在家裏叫我們，總是正旅館，菜館那些地方。於是我們的一塊錢裏頭，先就要分去兩毛錢給來叫我們的茶房們。這錢，是千萬不能省，也不能心痛的，因為，若是得罪了這班「抽血鬼」，他們就眞會搗蛋，以後，他們那地方，你就別想第二次的生意。這樣說來，我出去一點鐘，不就可以掙進八毛錢嗎？慢來，慢來，我們還得分拆呢，嚮導社的老板，他們不拿錢，為甚麽來着？於是，這八毛錢，還得分給他呢。這分拆，却有幾種，要看這嚮舞女是那一等的上等，多半是二六分拆，就是，老板拿兩毛，她到手六毛。也有三五，對半的，至於我說眞氣死人，我的是二六分拆，老閭拿六毛我却只有兩毛錢能到手。據說，我是末等，因為，第一，我長得不够美！這話，你們可千萬別信他胡，我自己照鏡子，瞧瞧比他們所謂頭等的　也差不了多少，說不定，比她們還好些呢，可是，自古來，識「貨」的人本來太少啊！第二，我不會跳舞這話，也該打，跳舞有什麽難，反正，我個子高，力氣大，只要高興跳起來，保管可以拉着客人，跳得只轉。第三，我沒有進過新學堂的小學一二年級，不能充女學生出身——他們那些該死的傢伙！將我念過三字經百家姓的事，都全忘啦，總之，若不是，我還有天賦的那股風流勁兒當嚮導女幾乎會被他們拒絕呢，這先別管他，再說我們出門的情形吧，那些頭等的，多半有些熟客，常打電話，或者叫人來，指名要她去，但是，有時分身不開呢，怎麼辦？那就該我這樣的人出馬了。客人叫的是她，不管三七二十一，我去，到了那兒，客人當然一，怎麽哪，變了　兒？我却只做不知，由他們去嚷。若是，有些客人，老實不客氣的問：我叫的是某某人，為甚麽她不來，倒來了你？故我就作驚訝說，原來不是叫我嗎？那一定是，我們將名字聽錯啦。若問起我的名字來，當然，我的名字，和他所辨的人，只差那麽很難分辦的一點音調，他們自然無可奈何，留我坐下，或者打發我走，反正，一塊　，總得拿出來，這玩意兒，就叫做：「李代桃優」。</p>
<p>有人說，做饗導女，還不如做女僕來得淸白，因為，用力氣掙錢，比靠着妖腔媚態換錢，究竟「高尙」得多。可是，現在，我們也不在乎「高尙」了，我以為，做女侯，一天忙到晚，淸白是淸白了，怎及得來現在，每天見的人，都是些經理，大班，行員老板之流，一些高等人物。我們和他們，花天酒地，鬧得他們都挺樂的，要是做女僕吧，雖然，　着一題淸白的心，但是，那些有身份的人，誰來理你！所以，我以為，反正，那些自命有身份的人，愛這個調調兒，我們樂得不顧什麼淸自，什麼靈魂，撈他幾個冤錢再說，你們說，我這主意沒有打錯吧！</p>
<h3>一日一人</h3>
<p>誰都知道，德國鐵血宰相俾士麥是個有名的開檢和擊劍的能手。</p>
<p>一次，老俾還在年靑的時候！跟當時德國大科學家維周，不知為了甚麼，發生了爭執，標準軍人就傲慢地提議决鬥：『隨你選擇武器好了。』</p>
<p>維周敎授雖然埋頭實騐室，手無縛雞之力，授但也不甘示弱，硬着頭皮接受了挑戰約期後會。</p>
<p>决鬥的日子終　降臨了，旁觀的人們都替文弱的維周祖心，因為他是不堪俾士麥一擊的。但是，維周大敎授很從容地自袋裏模出他的武器，向鐵血宰相高聲嚷起來：</p>
<p>『這是兩塊三明治，也就是你我决鬥的武器，其中一塊含有最毒的毒茵吃了以後，保險你活不了，但是，另外一塊却絕對無害。請你挑選一塊吧，其餘一塊，我當吃下。我們的機會完全一樣，這是絕對公平的。來吧！我的朋友！』</p>
<p>這一下，可把鐵血宰相嚇仲了，他雖然英雄，但對這種武器，終究不慣，終於只好和維周敎授含笑握手，取消了　定的决鬥。　·俾士麥·</p>
<p>地球先生；響導姑娘，請你引導我找一塊？</p>
<p>乾凈土；好嗎？</p>
<p>響導姑娘；啊　，你還是到南極去玩吧！</p>
<h3>氣象臺</h3>
<p>東京談判、還不會揭開幕子、但吹　叭的、敲銅鼓的、裝佈景的、配燈光的、却芷忘得一團、停止援華也、諒解日軍行動也、東京批准也、對英强硬也……這不禁令人想到一年前的慕尼黑、老希率領着兩戈、大擺龍門陣終就套住了一把雨×、這一次、又要在遠東上釣了嗎？再說一次：中國决不是捷克、</p>
<p>亞道夫希特勒先生，波蘭的守士將士，己經把子彈上膛了，你要嘗一顆嗎？哈！你也在字典上找到「怕」字啦，也許你又將張大着嘴巴；我現在幷不想眞動手呀；我在替東京堆佈景啦；」好，有你的，</p>

<h3>小問題</h3>
<p>這裏是一個很古故事：話說有一天，風和日暖，蘇羅門王在御花園散步，經過花壇旁，聽見一只雄胡蝶向他妻子說：「我只要他翅膀稍為震動一下，蘇羅門王的宮門便開了。」蘇羅門王聽了把這是什麼話，大為震怒，立刻囘宮召見諸臣，命令他們速卽把這目無王法的胡蝶捕獲治罪。數分鐘後，顏色　白混身顫抖的犯人，匍伏在王帝的面前審判終結、胡蝶招認有罪，不過他請求王帝讓他再講一句話：「尊嚴的王帝啊，你自已也是個結婚的人，你猜我為什麽要向妻子講這種話？」</p>
<p>蘇羅門王不愧為大智，略一思索，便明白了。當下就很體諒，把胡蝶釋放。據說：雄胡蝶囘家之後，他的妻子問他，見了王帝怎樣。胡蝶很從容隨便地囘答他道「蘇羅門王求我不要弄壞他的宮殿」。</p>
<p>讀者一定比蘇羅門五更聰明，你猜雄胡蝶為什麽對妻子講這種話？</p>
<h3>海上風壇24</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述</p>
<p>一九一四年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，趁德輪去遊歷歐洲，因為英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來。仔容易地逃出虎口。囘到美境。傑克與比爾便囘紐約去，見到邱。邱又叫他們趁「聖瑪克號」去歐洲找他的兒子。在艦上；傑克不肯替一個名叫强生的人發封密碼電報，原來那條伙就是叫拉維基的德國間…</p>
<p>「我也不比你淸楚些，從我們由白港到紐約。在車站上分手之後，我沒再見過他，事實上，事情進行得這般神速，我也沒工夫想到他身上。他吿訴過我，說，他要赶第一條開往法國的船。」</p>
<p>『好吧，我們再談老煨雞。你預備去吿發他嗎？』</p>
<p>『向誰吿發？』</p>
<p>「立刻，吿訴船長。」</p>
<p>『有什麼好處呢？他沒有犯什麽罪，只要他不來惹我們，他高興改個姓名旅行，我們是管不着他的。』</p>
<p>『這倒是眞的。不過，儘管這樣，若是另外再有英國巡洋艦上來調査我可要去說他幾句。』比爾很心的說。</p>
<p>『我希望，能知道那史和志是誰？』</p>
<p>『乘客名單上，可有他？』</p>
<p>『沒有，否則，「勃維克號」上來的軍官就要査間啦，他特別注意帶有德國音的名宇。』</p>
<p>「所以囉，」比爾點着頭，「他在這船上，也是冒着險。我猜，老煨鷄的朋友，一定也有一個帶美國音的名字，那才能讓他安然渡過這大海洋呢。」</p>
<p>不多一會兒，傑克囘到無綫電室去，那兒，有他的鋪位；當他走近無綫電室的門時，那門開着，從裏面露出一些淡黃色的燈光，傑克看見，或老是他想着，有兩個人影，在一條救生艇的後面，但是，等他想看淸楚，已經就不見了。</p>
<p>那時間，傑克假定那是兩個船上的水手但是，當他們溜過一張過道的門時，看出他們，穿的是普通衣服，並不是水手們的制服。</p>
<p>『奇怪。』他自語着，『這兩個人，纏在無線電室旁邊，分明不懷好意；不然，他們何必看見我來啦，就溜跑呢。我願音打賭一客煮餅，那兩個傢伙，一定是老煨鷄，和他那個懂得無線電的寶貨·傑克，老夥計啊，這，你就得將眼睛睜開點啦。』</p>
<p>『做些什麽沒有？』他一進無線電室，就問馬倫。</p>
<p>『什麽都沒有，寂靜得像大年初一的早上。』</p>
<p>『剛才，你沒有看見我們什麽老朋友嗎？』</p>
<p>『誰，强生？沒有，他沒有來過。』</p>
<p>傑克點點頭，道了聲晚安，就去睡了。但是，船在夜裏航若，他的眼睛，倒不肯像往常一樣，很舒服的閉着，就睡着了。</p>
<p>他心里正忙着許多事，分明的，垃維基，是想在無綫電里，要些玩意兒。但是，就傑克所知道的，現在，還不過是在汽筒後面聽到的一些話，他想，這是他的責任，必定得加以阻止。</p>

<h3>浙茶管理方法</h3>
<p>— 馮和法</p>
<p>去年豺政部貿易委員會奉命辦理全國茶葉統銷、為戰時農業政策樹立之初基、本年為使茶葉之產製運銷、獲有根本之改造、財政部呈准行政院頒佈各省茶業管理機關組織通則、使各省成立之茶業管理機關與貿委會取得聯繫以作進一步之推進浙江省於本年三月間成立油茶棉絲管理處、由建設廳與各中央機關合作、各部內容間有不同、茶葉方面卽與貿委會訂立貸欵收茶合約、責成管理處茶葉部辦理產製運輸各方面改進事宜、處長由建設廳伍廳長自兼、費鴻年劉寶琛兩先生分任副處長、委由本人主持茶葉部事宜、因茶葉統銷為抗戰以來最見成效之特產、在貿委會鄒秉文吳覺農兩先生主持之下、對於茶業整個之改造以及對於抗戰之配合、早具詳盡之計劃、浙江茶業管理卽遵旣定方針、參酌當地特殊情形、逐步推進、大槪情形、略述如次、</p>
<p>（一）四大目標</p>
<p>戰時茶業政策、目標有四、一日爭取物資、為動員物力之一部、其目的在不為人用、並使原由私人操縱之散漫力量、得能集中、二曰增强金融、換取外匯、亦卽爭取物資之具體內容、此需政府統籌運銷、增加出口、始克有濟、三日安定農村、增加茶葉生產、以富裕農民經濟、平衡各　利益、健全茶農組織、此不僅為戰時經濟政策所要求、亦係促進民衆組織之方法、四曰根本改造整個茶葉生產之體系、以為抗戰　國之一端、蓋在平時　欲圖茶業之改進、阻於人為困難者指不勝屈、當此戰時、社會若干惡勢力、隨戰事而消逝、亦正茶業之抗戰建國之機會也、</p>
<p>（二）四種步驟</p>
<p>戰時茶業政策之推進、依生產之步驟分如下四階段、一曰改良生產、增益農民、現茶農之種植茶樹、揀製毛茶、均極散漫簡陋、不明技術、雖似主因、實以山價旡有保障、獲利不易、飢寒足虞、自難擴充生產、改進技術、故問題關鍵、在於如何維持毛茶善價、不受剝削、二曰　全茶廠、改進製造、良以今日各地之茶廠、不僅簡陋、且多迹近投機、時製時輟、毫無較久遠之計劃、此因運銷機構未能合理、市場無保障、有以致之、廠受之於中間商者人、必轉嫁于茶農、層層剝創、勢必同歸于盡、三曰減少居間、取消陋規、原有買辦性之代銷茶棧、勾結洋行、壓迫茶廠、陋規重重、名目繁多、茶業衰落、實階之厲、四曰直接貿易、增加出口、此為商品性農產最後問題、無銷納巿場固遑論茶業改進、然如不能直接貿易、仍受制於洋行居間、則殊無法以推廣市場也、（未完）</p>

<h3>古文和今文</h3>
<p>— 楊晉豪</p>
<p>一個時代的文章，是表達一個時代的精神的，文章的內容，（見解）和形式（語調），應該符合時代精神；這已經成為常識了。</p>
<p>可是，吾國今日所流行的文章，仍有許多連這樣的常識都還沒有做到。是做着現代的人，有的却偏偏要用古文來寫古文的見解有的却把今人的見解用古文來寫，有的却用今文來寫古人的見解。第一種等於行屍走肉，第二種等於現代的活鬼第三種等於木乃伊的喬裝打扮；都配不上稱為眞正的「今文」——新時代的文章。</p>
<p>目前尤其流行的是一種文章，有著現代的靈魂，却云做活鬼，使人捉摸不清，這真是自己奚落自己。</p>
<p>不過，他們是奚落自己，倒也罷了；却偏偏還在這社會上估了相當地位讓一斑生氣蓬勃的後生小子，不得不費掉許多精力，去捉摸那些鬼形鬼影，甚至還要追隨着他們去作那鬼聲鬼氣。那作孽可眞不少了！</p>
<p>為求節省些文化靑年們的精力，勿使化在寃枉路中，而用到更深遠的造詣上去，同時，也為讓那些沒有多錢去學那古腔古調的大衆，也能够求得知識，也能够抒發情意；我要請求大人先生們大家來革除古文遺孹，擴大今文運動；</p>
<p>（一）大中學校的入學考試，一律限用今文寫：就是要用現代語來寫現代的見解。有的大學或高中的國文出題先生，滿搬些四書五經上的老古董，甚至閱卷先生只看文言試卷，不看白話試卷，像這樣强迫靑年學生開倒車的習氣，非竭力剷除不可！</p>
<p>（二）所有往來公文，無論呈，咨，令，批，尤其是政府機關的佈吿，命令……等，應該廢除各種官場老調，一律改用白話寫。</p>
<p>（三）一切社會上的應用文，無論書信，契約，廣吿，柬帖……等，應該廢除各種因襲俗套，完全改用白話寫。</p>
<p>（四）報紙雜誌上的新聞·文章……更當用白話寫，以為提倡，以便普及。</p>
<p>有些人說，寫文言經濟。其實這不一定。譬如有一則電訊說：「……此間認為天津事件之相平解决希望，甚為微薄……」改做白話，可寫為：「這裏認為要和平解决天津事件的希望很少」，不是也可以省一個字嗎？有許多無病呻吟，或是滿紙老套的老古董，看他搖頭擺尾，說不出一點道理來，那才是不經濟極了！所以，文章的經濟不經濟，要看它內容是否充實，說話是否費辭而定，並且，用白話寫，在作者可以少費一番學讀古文的功夫，和讀時把文言譯成白話功夫。那不是比寫文言要經濟得多嗎？</p>
<p>「文學革命」，一革命文學」，鼓吹了二十多年，而仍有不少靑年生學要求讀古文，學文言；而吾國的敎育也至今不會眞正普及；這完全是因為社會上所流行的新古董——文言——在作祟。所以　要求教育　管，政府要員，和各界領袖，應當早一點明令或者倡導今文。使那些新古董在社會上失掉了根據，那末，符合時代精神的今文自然會抬頭而普及，「文學革命」和「革命文學」自然會取得更進一步的勝利。</p>
<p>以上雖然是老話重提，但是至今仍値得大聲疾呼。希望大家「旣知必行」，踏實地來幹一下。</p>
<h3>民間的武力</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>……戰地追記……</p>
<p>商城人皖，有兩路可通：一由魚子店至揮旗山，過四道河二十里，卽為皖境，這是比較平坦的大路；另一路由絲瓜墩至蘇仙石，越黃土嶺而達皂靴河，此為最近的捷徑，但道路盤曲，山坡陡斜，非步行不辦。我們從宋埠到商城，已經晚間九時光景，雖然有兵監部的卡車代步，但每經山水匯積的廣大石灘，仍須下車涉水而渡，要不然，車輪眼亂石開起玩笑來，準會使你舉行「下水典禮」的。</p>
<p>當晚，我們投宿於縣府隔壁的大華飯店，在商城城中，算是首屈一指的旅舘，紙糊的窗門，凹凸的泥地，破舊的竹榻，無一不保存着中古時代的作風。然而物質條件的低劣，正可以反映出社會生活的樸素釆，中州人民的堅苦耐勞，於此可燭其微了。而且民性强悍，自經這次的組織，訓練，以及政治常識的灌輸，在「保衛我們的家鄕」聲中，都是摩拳擦掌，準備着揮洒他們的熱血。</p>
<p>安徽省委章乃器先生，那天也留宿商城這位並不陌生的民族鬥士，從武漢囘皖，道經這里，所以就遇見了。他穿了一套破　的灰布制服，在院子　踱來踱去，誰也不知道他是現任的高級官吏。</p>
<p>「啊，上那兒去？」他似乎有點詫異。</p>
<p>「安徽。」我答道，「皖西去　」隨卽加上一句。</p>
<p>「那麽一塊兒同行了」？</p>
<p>「不，我們也許要往信陽考察一下」。</p>
<p>於是，他吿訴我們這里民衆動員工作的狀况，表示着非常滿意的興奮，落後，他說入皖的一百五十里山路，只有借重一雙脚，因為皖西鹽米兩缺，不能不動昌民佚，以作未雨的綢繆，所以僱轎就絕對沒辦法。</p>
<p>不知怎的，縣長陳守常先生居然然發現了章先生的來臨，在明天的一淸早，就到大華來請他去演講，我們也連帶地被約了。及至演講完畢，我們在全城巡禮一周。這座河南邊境的古老縣城，周圍不滿十里，因為地處戰區，街市顯得非常沉寂；但民衆對於抗戰的情緒，却極為緊張，由於演講會中所得的印象，當然可以證明的。據說：河南光州的舊屬六縣，因連年閙着匪患，民間的防禦工作，向來就做得很好，保甲制度，也相當完密，將來流動戰一開始，商城的民問武力，便立刻會發揮出來，用以担當着皖西防衛，那是綽乎有餘的。證以商城陷落，已有半年之久。而鐵騎終於沒有越過皂靴河一步，雖憑天險，亦賴人力，誰說政治工作不重要呢？</p>
<h3>頓河堤上</h3>
<p>— 曾兆筠</p>
<p>頓河在靜靜地南流，半　的月亮涎　面孔在看水，暗綠的漪漪緩緩地動盪　似乎要帶着水面的月色跑哩。</p>
<p>星空籠罩下的兩岸，像熟睡了一樣寥寂，堤邊的落花　到水面的聲音，也淸淸楚楚可以聽見。</p>
<p>但，當一匹淺黃色的汽艇，「轟隆，轟隆」地沿江疾駛的時候，周遭的寂靜便被打破了，艇裏站着坐着的，約摸四十多個人，白色的制服，和鑲上藍邊的大領。</p>
<p>「這是他媽的洗烏水，又鐵又腥！我要渴死了！」一個說，「唉！渴還不要緊。餓是更加難捱！你看，沿江一帶，都是滿目烽烟，凄凉冷漠！人是通通跑光了，那裏有吃的東西可找？唉！唉！我要餓壞了！」另一個說。</p>
<p>「兄弟們不要吵！」一像個隊長的站起來，揚起左手向東指着，「那邊的一個村落　看去彷彿還有人家，我們就到那邊去碰碰運氣吧」。</p>
<p>當汽艇的軀幹，模到岸邊的時候，四十多條的大漢，便像被趕的白鵝似的蜂湧上岸，整個村　差不冬都走過了，擺在眼前的，除却碎瓦頹垣和摸糊的血肉以外，更看不見什麼東西。</p>
<p>一斑失望的人，脚步都放得很緩慢唉聲嘆氣的互相埋怨，霎時，從幾縣焦黑的古松後面，傳來微細的，凄慘的抽咽。</p>
<p>「太家聽，這不是婦人的哭聲麽？」隊長站定了說，三步拚作兩步的跟著聲音跑，果然他的猜想不錯，松　的後背果然坐着一個披頭散學容顏憔　的婦人。盤着雙腿坐在一大堆乾稻草上面，繼的懷裏，還抱著一個小嬰孩。</p>
<p>「喂，你是不是奸細！一個人坐在這裏幹嗎？」隊長發出兇暴的聲音問。</p>
<p>「啊喲！天神菩薩！」婦人露出慌張的表情，「我……我不是什麽奸細！我是從遠道跑來的難民哩，我求你不要這麽大聲，恐怕要嚇壞我的孩子！」</p>
<p>「你坐着的是什麽東西，你讓開給我檢査！」</p>
<p>「我的腮酸得很呢，可以不用檢査了吧？」</p>
<p>「設什麽屁話！快滾開！」</p>
<p>婦人擁着孩子，兩條疲腿顫動的站起來。又倒下去！隊長等得不耐煩了，跳上去一掌把她推開，接着便走上幾個人把稻草翻起，掩蓋着是什麽東西？原來是兩隻燒熟的猪腿；一罐杳冽的老酒。</p>
<p>隊長微笑的向婦人擠着眼睛道：『好　看不出你這婆娘，竟是我們的救命恩人哩，不過，這些東西——』他彎著腰向猪腿哄了一下，「靠得住吧」？</p>
<p>『哈哈哈！』婦人忽然笑起來，「你是疑心這些東西下了毒藥？反正已給你們看見，我也不用隱瞞，這些東西都是從我丈夫的家鄕帶來，準備孝敬我的娘家的，想不到來到這裏，迎接我的却是變了色的故鄉，爺娘呵！」她又哭起來。</p>
<p>「隊長！」一陣嘈雜的叫聲，一和她廢話什麽，快把東西分開來吃吧！我們都餓得要死了！」</p>
<p>『不准　！』隊長囘頭向士兵掃了一下威嚴的眼光，然後轉身對婦人說：「大嫂，旣是這麼樣，倒便宜了我們，不過，我們自吃你的也不好！——「他把腰間的白權瓢解下，滿滿的斟上一瓢老酒，「讓我來先敬你一杯吧。」</p>
<p>「好　好　好　官長的心是好的」。她接過酒一飲而盡。</p>
<p>「喂！隊長！她自己都吃了！我們　不吃？」又是一陣乖涎欲滴的大叫。</p>
<p>『不准鬧鬧」隊長第二次命令。再斟半瓢酒給婦人，『你這小孩子也吃一點吧，他的臉色不大好，吃了會紅潤一點哩。』</p>
<p>婦人接過酒，略一遲疑，便向孩子裏裏送大家都不曾注意，她的手在不住地抖動。</p>
<p>孩子吃完了酒，士兵們不等隊長的命令便邊上來撿東西吃，隊長這囘也放了心，撕着猪腿望嘴裏塞，正在狼呑虎嚥的時候，婦人的哭聲又傳過來。</p>
<p>「你的孩子為什麽變藍了？啊！死了麽？」隊長跳起來問。</p>
<p>是呀，他已經死了呀！他是為國家為民族死了呀！「婦人慷慨激昂地說，「我們母子兩人的生命，換了四十多個敵人的生命，這是……這是……値得的！」有點兒支持不住了。她用最後上口氣說，「聽着，人類的屠殺者呵！我們在黃泉相見，也永遠是「敵人」哩！」</p>
<h3>懈怠</h3>
<p>— 恝絜</p>
<p>朋友，我常聽得說過：『沒有退後，沒有休息。』何况你已經踏上了眞實的道路。</p>
<p>寂寥，苦悶緊緊地包圍着我們差一點兒就要窒息死了。我們過着牢獄式的生活，儘量地叫喊怨嘆，但有誰來憫　我們，釋放我們？</p>
<p>我們至少不曾掩面哭泣，更不曾把握着死將來臨：我們一心一意要找尋一條出路。</p>
<p>雖比不上猛獸的出押，也可算是到展翅的小鳥，自由的天空任憑飛翔。道路是找着了，我們已開始踏上，什麽都將不難實現。</p>
<p>過程也許是苦的，但這是新的降臨。我相信有無數的事物可使我們鼓舞興奮。朋友，你也似曾這樣地想過吧！</p>
<p>我不懂你不什麽要屢屢囘顧，牢獄式生活値得什麽留戀？美滿物質安適地享受，朋友，那是鴆樂！</p>
<p>你又遲遲不前，雖然你不承認這是退後，是休息，然而你懈怠了，你的精神將頹唐下去。再也無從收拾起。</p>
<p>永遠過着奴隸安適生活的人們，正向你招着手。我明瞭，他們誘惑了你，但我們曾叫喊怨嘆過的啊，你難道就此忘了？</p>
<p>你的意志也許正在交戰、也許你已决定轉向歸，你的行動已如此懈怠。朋友，請你認淸一下子吧！</p>
<p>我們旣踏上了眞實的道路，我們何忍中途分離，携，起手來前進呀！</p>
<p>強奸——Raematkers作</p>
<h3>撲向了祖國</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>靑芷故意指點外面的人說給靜聞聽，她望！外面，隋又倚着椅背閉起眼睛來。忽然她又張大眼睛問：</p>
<p>『我們什麽時候可以到廣州呢？」</p>
<p>「今天總該到得了吧。」</p>
<p>青芷有心無意地答著。想起了廣州，那給她無限豐富的幻想，記得多少年前，靑年們到廣州去正如現在到陝北去一樣。雖然多少年的風浪把它的原質損壞了，但是那個地方仍然件着許多倔强的有血性的人是她所熱知的。</p>
<p>車不停地狂馳着，終於像勝利似地高聲吼着，速度就漸漸慢下來，經過岔道的列車搖幌着，憤怒地闖進了站台。　（未完）</p>

<h3>程伯勇氏趕返潮州救急抵港一席談</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>本報特寫　募得三架救護車</p>
<p>利多沙叻先生（Mr．WRasathury）印籍，充分同情我國抗戰的難得的國際友人。四十來歲，身材魁梧。在吉隆坡政府當公務員。職司樹膠執照的發行，交游頗廣，與我僑胞關係亦甚密切。他有高度的警覺性，深深了解中國的抗戰，是為着整個世界的公理與止義，最後的勝利，是必然會降臨的。因此，他利用他的地位與交際的長才，不　辛苦地籌　了新點坡銀一萬餘元，經已購了三架救護車，並裝滿了藥物，送交新　坡籌賑會，最近將運到中國來，以濟急　，為了這件事，感動了不少中西的人士，有錢不出錢的中國人，還有什麽面目見這位超國界的國際友人？我們，應向這位富於熱情，有正養感的朋友道謝，並致偉大崇高的敬禮。</p>
<p>六十餘元一碗麺</p>
<p>在新嘉坡一個熱烘洪的養　場中，使人感動得　下熱淚的奇蹟層出不窮。</p>
<p>有一個苦力，汗流浹背。短衣犢褲與粗大身材，全是勞碌與貧窮的記號。可是，他有靈塊，他有血性，他是中華民族優秀的子孫，他悄悄地挖若擁頭帶。終於把紮得緊緊的六十多元新加坡鈔票拿了出來，買了一碗義賣的　麵很痛快地吃下去。這碗麵，是他的全部財產的代價，不知流了多少血汙，請蓄了多少時日，可是，為了祖國明大的光榮，為了解開身上的　鎖，他　不躊躇地這樣幹着——這是很　實例當中的一個，誰是支　民族革命的主力，在這裏可以得到具體的啟示。</p>
<p>耳朶的故事</p>
<p>抵制仇貨在新嘉坡是眞眞正正地執行着，團體有團體的紀律，各行有各行的淸査辦法。誰是昧着良心去買賣仇貨。仇貨在新嘉坡。可以說是絕跡。抗戰情續，不消說是，分緊張。汪逆最近亦開始有走狗到那　活動，散佈「和平」的毒素，華僑團體巳經嚴密戒備着。如果發現有違背中央國策與領袖言論者，就不客氣地謂他出境。</p>

<h3>Building Our University</h3>
<p>— Su Lin</p>
<p>Many young people feel distressed because they cannot afford to go to school due to their families' financial circumstances, believing that their future is hopeless, and therefore become passive.</p>
<p>This is absolutely wrong. We don't necessarily have to go to schools for the wealthy to learn. We can learn and build "Our University" in any place and any environment. Because "society is our university," and this university is "all-encompassing" and "full of wonders," a good university that never ceases to amaze. For example, if we can't go to school, we can go to the countryside to farm. We can use this farming opportunity to study how to cultivate and improve agriculture. It would be best to find a few friends and form a group to discuss and research. If we learn about machinery, we can also invite a few friends to discuss and research together. This is much better than schools that only talk and "talk without doing"!</p>
<p>As I write this, some of you might question, "If I can't work with machinery or return to the countryside to farm, does that mean I can't learn?" No, absolutely not. If we cannot work with machinery or farm, we can still invite a few friends to study textbooks together, preferably focusing on theories of national salvation and political books. While this is good, it only benefits individuals and cannot contribute to the country or the nation. I think it would be better to join community organizations because there are many national salvation groups that offer singing classes, political training classes, guerrilla warfare training classes, seminars... We can learn a lot of national salvation theories here. At the same time, we can have the singing teams and drama groups in the community perform publicly to raise funds for the soldiers on the front lines, or organize comfort teams to visit the wounded soldiers, refugees, and soldiers on the front lines... Through these various activities, we can not only learn a lot of theories but also do something for the country and the nation. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>Young friends who are out of school or have not had the opportunity to study, please use every place and every opportunity to build "Our University" to learn practical and profound theories, and do a lot of practical national salvation work!</p>
<h3>Science and Poor Youth</h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>In our country today, everything requires science. People generally believe that science is different from other disciplines and requires teachers to lecture and adequate equipment for practice to find a path to learning. As a result, society recognizes science as something costly and closely related to financial matters. It seems that poor young people, even if they are naturally inclined towards science and most interested in it, have no opportunity to study science due to their poverty. However, from the perspective of the history of science, this view is not entirely accurate. Wealthy children have many opportunities to study science, but poor children are not entirely limited by money and prevented from entering the halls of learning. The key is to work tirelessly and apply oneself anytime, anywhere. Take Faraday, the great British electrician, for example. He was extremely poor in his youth and worked as a servant in a chemistry lab. However, he was diligent and eager to learn, constantly seeking guidance from Professor Davy. Later, he made contributions that shocked the world. Edison, the great American inventor, whose inventions have benefited humanity, is known to everyone. He started as a poor child who could not attend school and relied on selling newspapers on the street to make a living. One of his ears was injured, leading to lifelong deafness. Anyone who reads his biography knows the difficult circumstances of his youth, yet he was able to focus on pursuing science and ultimately achieved unprecedented success, becoming a great figure in history. From this, we can see that Faraday still had the advantage of being able to seek guidance from others, while Edison had none of these advantages and relied entirely on his own efforts to succeed. I have seen merchants in small grocery stores in America study insects in their spare time and become famous entomologists, writing extensively. Gardeners became plant experts and later became university professors. Servants in museums became experts in geology and paleontology and later became senior technicians at the museum. Servants in chemistry labs became chemistry experts and later became university professors. There are countless such wonderful stories. European and American countries have benefited from science. Their universities and research institutes have certainly contributed greatly, but the efforts of poor young people who have struggled from the bottom are also significant. Poor Chinese students today are advocating for self-study. Let them not be hesitant about science due to difficult circumstances!</p>
<h3>Wireless Radio Tunneling</h3>
<p>— Rong Ren</p>
<p>The Panshan Tunnel is a difficult engineering project in modern architecture. However, with the need for tunnels increasing for railroads, water pipes, and fortifications, tunnels must be dug from both ends to be more efficient. However, the direction must be extremely accurate when digging from both ends. Otherwise, even a slight error could lead to significant mistakes. In the past, the direction was determined entirely by surveying instruments, which were not easy to calculate, and the results were not always satisfactory. Now, there is a type of wireless radio direction finder that can guide workers to move forward in the mountains without going astray, allowing them to advance from both ends on the same straight line. Tunnel workers only need to follow the wireless radio signal through the mountain to reach their destination. This method can reduce many of the difficulties in tunneling. The Florence River Tunnel in the United States, which passes through a mountainous range of hard granite and is thirteen miles long, is the longest tunnel in the world. Tunnel workers also used wireless radio as a guide. The meeting point of the workers digging from both ends in the mountain differed by only thirty-six thousandths of an inch. The effectiveness of this can be imagined. Using wireless radio to guide workers to dig tunnels on a straight line.</p>
<h3>Morning Exercises</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>——A Fragment of a Strong Man's Life</p>
<p>The dawn breaks through the dark night. The fields gradually change color; the leaves and weeds reveal the gentle breath of the morning.</p>
<p>The bugle call broadcasts through the morning breeze, even more solemn and clear in the quiet space. Every strong man is inspired with ambition. We rush into the training ground in the misty morning air, running towards the flag waving in the wind. A group of us march, our feet making a "sasha...shali..." sound. The cinder road is kicked up with black dust, spreading and covering the roadside grass with a layer of black powder.</p>
<p>"Shush! Shush!" Another whistle sounds suddenly, signaling the assembly.</p>
<p>Standing under the flag, we form a long line: attention, alignment... Following the coach's strong voice, we begin our movements. Circular movements, once, twice, three times... Then, more excitedly and intensely, we run, sprint, lie down, charge, and then transform from a whole into parts, and gather the parts into a whole.</p>
<p>After these exercises, we begin to divide into two opposing groups, practicing positional warfare, deploying guerrillas, disrupting the enemy's rear, and assisting the regular army in counterattacks. The use of all our intelligence and strength feels like a real battle situation!</p>
<p>Our discipline and performance are almost equal to that of regular troops; however, we cannot be complacent because we are the reserve force for the current stage of the War of Resistance. We have the responsibility to revive the nation and create a new China! We must be more courageous and determined, and strive towards the goal of national liberation!</p>
<p>The excited group becomes even more excited, raising their strong voices and singing loudly: "For the freedom of our people's survival, we will not hesitate to use our blood, we will not hesitate to use our heads, to fight against the invaders!..."</p>
<p>At this time, the team marches out of the training ground solemnly, with songs. Everyone looks at this beautiful field, bathed in the morning sun, and their hearts are filled with ardent hopes.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese are the Mother of Revolution</h3>
<p>— You Ji</p>
<p>A Grand Meeting of All Circles in Huiyang Welcoming Representative Zhong</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong Chunsheng, a representative of the Yongyang overseas Chinese who has been traveling and appealing for the salvation of the motherland, led more than 70 young overseas Chinese compatriots back to China to serve the country and arrived in Huizhou on October 9th.</p>
<p>On the 10th, various Huizhou salvation organizations, such as the Huiyang Youth Anti-Japanese Association, the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard, the Huiyang Children's Work Corps, the Orphanage, the Overseas Chinese Return Service Corps, and the Provincial Relief Association, held a joint welcome. This was an unprecedented grand meeting, a major event in Huizhou after the disaster!</p>
<p>This group of outstanding descendants of the Chinese nation, the flames of revenge burning in the blood of each one of them, in order to achieve the goal of revenge, they are willing to spill this passionate blood on the territory of the motherland. Therefore, they abandoned the "banana rain and coconut breeze" of Southeast Asia, abandoned their gentle and beautiful families, and comfortable lives, and resolutely ran back to the battlefield of the motherland, ready to fight against the Japanese!</p>
<p>In the history of the revolution, the overseas Chinese have a glorious history. The success of the Premier's revolutionary cause was indeed greatly aided by the overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Premier said: "Overseas Chinese are the mother of revolution!"</p>
<p>In this sacred national revolutionary war, the overseas Chinese have also fulfilled their great responsibility with a glorious history. Many young overseas Chinese men and women have eagerly returned to the motherland to participate in the front-line killing of the Japanese, rescue work, and rear relief and propaganda work. Batches of pilots and a large number of machine workers have also returned to the motherland to participate in national defense industries or front-line transportation... In short, overseas Chinese are involved in every sector of the War of Resistance. Especially in the economic aspect, it is like a surging spring, constantly assisting the motherland. This proves how much the overseas Chinese love their motherland!</p>
<p>At the meeting, Mr. Zhong reported many valuable facts of overseas Chinese patriotism to us. He said: "The Kuala Lumpur team's return to China this time is unprecedentedly great. Although many overseas Chinese compatriots have returned to China to serve the country in the past, they were all individual. This time, however, it is a large group, which has aroused the sympathy of the overseas Chinese, further aroused the sympathy of international figures, and also aroused the attention of the Japanese and traitors!</p>
<p>"When we left Kuala Lumpur, we met a stateless Jew on the train. He was touched by our patriotic enthusiasm and volunteered to donate 200 yuan. When we were about to leave Singapore, the pier was crowded with thousands and thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots, forming a wall of flesh, raising countless iron arms, and enthusiastically sending us off. On the way back across the ocean, we suddenly received a telegram from the British government saying; the Japanese were going to intercept and inspect us at the port of Qiongzhou, which was told to me by someone on the ship. Later, we changed our route and arrived safely in Hong Kong." This proves that, on the one hand, the aggressors are using all kinds of shameless means to eliminate our various anti-Japanese forces, and on the other hand, our anti-aggression war for justice and peace has won the widespread sympathy of peace-loving people in the world!</p>
<p>He also told a story that made people gratefully shed tears: When he returned to Southeast Asia this time, he was welcomed by overseas Chinese compatriots who cared about the motherland and invited him to speak on the situation of the War of Resistance in the motherland, especially the East River that he had personally seen – the disaster situation of the East River after being ravaged by the Japanese. When he spoke of the countless Huizhou orphans who were homeless, without clothing, and without food, all the overseas Chinese elders, youths, and children were moved to tears. The whole hall sobbed, how sympathetic are the overseas Chinese to the suffering compatriots of the motherland! Mr. Zhong said: "This time I have returned to the motherland, I don't have anything to bring to everyone, only a warm sympathy shared by more than 1.7 million overseas Chinese!" This is such earnest and moving words!</p>
<p>At the same time, he (Mr. Zhong) was conducting fundraising in various ways in Southeast Asia. One day, he went to a mountain village to collect the money that had already been donated, and he happened to meet an overseas Chinese compatriot who came out of the mountain village to buy rice and vegetables. He had promised to donate one dollar. When Mr. Zhong saw him, he turned red in the face and hurriedly unwrapped a paper package he was holding, layer by layer, revealing only one dollar. He took this one dollar and gave it to Mr. Zhong. In this way, he could not buy rice and vegetables, and he went back to the mountain village by himself. Ah! This patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese is so moving. In order to protect their motherland and not be slaves, they are willing to contribute the food they eat, the clothes they wear, and even their lives to the country and the nation. Their spirit of enduring cold and hunger, and their spirit of sacrificing their families for the sake of the country, is so admirable. We, the people of the motherland, should use our flesh and blood to defend the motherland and repay the patriotic overseas Chinese with action!</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Zhong also said: "When we issued the call to 'return to the country to serve the country' this time, there were more than 300 young people in Malaya alone who enthusiastically participated. After the examination, 73 were selected. Our selection at that time was not based on the method of imperial examinations, but only asked a few simple questions orally: (1) Are you afraid of death? (2) Can you endure hardship? (3) Will you return to Southeast Asia again? The 73 selected were all very brave and passionate young people, and most of them had done great salvation work in Southeast Asia, such as eradicating hatred and lending movements, and cutting off the ears of traitors. These are all great and heroic facts." Who says that overseas Chinese only contribute money in foreign countries?</p>
<p>"Now the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are holding fundraising events in the form of entertainment. Admission tickets are issued for the entertainment events, and each ticket costs three or four cents, ten yuan, five yuan, or even thousands of yuan. Each entertainment event can raise tens of thousands of yuan. Especially worthy of praise is that the red envelopes that adults give to children during the Lunar New Year are also donated." In short, the overseas Chinese are using various ways to raise funds to help the War of Resistance in order to protect their motherland. This patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese is glorious and great.</p>
<p>Finally, let us end this article with the words of the Premier:</p>
<p>"Overseas Chinese are the mother of revolution!"</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Belongings of the German and Japanese Invaders Should be shouted</h3>
<p>Recently, two trends of the same nature and interconnected have emerged in Europe and the Far East: one is the active deployment of German troops in Danzig, and the other is the reckless and delusional actions of the Japanese army on the Outer Mongolian border. The Japanese and puppet forces have attacked the Soviet Union on the Mongolian-puppet border more than once. This time, they even launched a large-scale air attack on Soviet-Mongolian challenges. Although they have repeatedly failed, they are still unwilling to stop. According to a foreign dispatch from Changchun, Japanese forces are gathering more and more on the border between the puppet Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia, deliberately causing trouble, and disputes are increasing. Japan is also using its past tricks to publicize how the Soviet-Mongolian army is launching a large-scale attack on General's Temple, and that battles are taking place anytime, anywhere, using this as an excuse to attack the Soviet Union. It is no accident that Japan is attacking the Soviet Union at a time when its invasion of China has stalled. The reason is that in Europe, the deployment of Nazi troops and National Socialist Party members in Danzig is gradually being completed, and Danzig has essentially become a wartime scenario. All those of conscription age in Danzig have been enlisted and are wearing German military uniforms in the streets. All barracks are full of troops, and old barracks and old forts are also busy being rebuilt. On the other hand, the German mouthpiece, the German Political Commissioner in Danzig, Forster, released information on the anniversary of the founding of the Nazi local party headquarters, stating that the people of Danzig are willing to merge with Germany and that the merger will be implemented soon. The two aggressors in the East and West are preparing to enjoy the sweetness of their illusions!</p>
<p>However, this sweetness may not be so easy to enjoy again. The Nazis' past good dreams of conquering the East may stumble this time on the stumbling block of Poland! Under the covetous gaze of the Nazi crusaders, Poland has not only resolved to resist to the end, but is also actively preparing to counterattack the aggressors head-on. On the other hand, Britain and France's guarantee to Poland, that is, Poland itself is also convinced: "If Germany uses force to change the political status of Danzig, then Britain and France will inevitably intervene." "The Polish government's official newspaper reprinted news from London and Paris." Various newspapers have also published news that the British and French fleets will sail to the port of Kynia in the North Sea. Poland has also openly declared: "If Germany wants war, we will not avoid fighting a war with it."</p>
<p>In the Far East, the Japanese aggressors, in response to Hitler's planned demands, are actively stirring up trouble in various parts of South China with their navy. ? , While the army is launching an attack on the Soviet Union. The frantic actions of the southernization only expose the weaknesses of the return of light, and the obstacles to its future are far greater than Germany's advance to the east.</p>
<p>However, one point that should be recognized here is that the reckless actions of the two aggressors in the East and West have a common goal, which is to intimidate Britain and take the form of mutual checks and balances. At this time, Britain needs to deeply understand that the threat of the Eastern aggressor is greater than that of the European aggressor. If Britain surrenders to the aggressor in the East, the impact will not only be limited to the loss of interests in the Far East, but will also increase the courage of the Western aggressor. Britain's plan for today is only to show toughness to the Eastern aggressor. If its encirclement and blockade become increasingly tighter, it should take concrete and effective measures to break through it. The Japanese aggressors, wanting to deal with Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China at the same time, is difficult among difficulties, even if this conflict is still limited to the local area. Taking a step back, Britain can ignore Japan's various unreasonable demands. If Britain agrees to a Japanese demand that is sufficient to hinder China's War of Resistance, then Japan will gain more and more, and Britain will have no foothold in the Far East.</p>

<h3>The War North of the Yellow River Intensifies × Adopts New Strategy to Attack Guerrilla Areas Military Expert Analyzes Recent Battle Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an Fourth Dispatch] A military expert said that × is currently making large-scale deployments in China, with the Pinghan, Pingsui, Jinpu, and Tongpu lines all experiencing extremely busy military transport. In the territories of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi, large forces of × troops are launching large-scale offensives against our guerrilla base areas. Their objectives are: (1) to attempt to consolidate their obtained war gains and solidify the puppet regime; (2) to prepare for an offensive in the Northwest. In terms of strategy, × has also abandoned its past "dangerous in-depth" approach and adopted a "step-by-step" approach. Using their superior firepower, they are conducting "leaps forward" from strongholds, building bunkers, and constructing highways, attempting to shrink our guerrilla areas and increase the area of "face" under their occupation. However, although × has increased its forces in China to 35 divisions, implementing what is called a steady and solid approach is still impossible. Our military authorities are confident and have already issued appropriate instructions, and good news will surely arrive soon, it is said.</p>

<p>Jiangxi Guerrilla Force Gains Momentum</p>
<p>[Central News Agency A Certain Place in Northern Jiangxi Third Dispatch] Military news: Because the momentum of our guerrilla forces in northern Jiangxi is growing, × has repeatedly launched large-scale encirclements and suppression against our guerrilla units. At the beginning of last month, after × attacked us from Shanggao and was defeated, recently, over a thousand × infantry and cavalry from Anyi and Jing'an came on the 2nd and launched a large-scale offensive in four directions against a certain guerrilla unit of ours north of Zhanggong in the south of the Xiu River, and indiscriminately burned and killed people in villages near Babu and Liu. Our troops were deployed in a strong defensive position in the highlands of a certain area. × launched several fierce attacks with all their strength, but were all repelled by us. The fierce battle lasted until the evening. Our troops became more courageous, and × were even less able to succeed, so they indiscriminately burned and killed in villages near Suoyushan, which is about five miles east of Yunping Mountain. He Hanwu, the squad leader of a certain unit of ours, bravely led his troops around to the rear of ×, launched a fierce attack on ×, and then engaged in hand-to-hand combat. × was finally unable to withstand it and retreated to Huilin overnight. In this battle, over 20 × troops were killed, and over 30 × troops were wounded. Many weapons were captured.

<h3>After Strict Opium Prohibition Guizhou Prospers Financial Activity Brisk Agricultural Products Sell Well Wu Ding Returns from Inspection and Speaks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guiyang Third Dispatch] Wu Xianyu, who inspected various administrative regions of the province, returned to the province yesterday after completing his inspection. He traveled 1,500 kilometers and inspected over 20 counties. Our reporter specially inquired about his impressions.

In addition, with the widespread establishment of cooperative treasuries and cooperatives, financial activity is brisk, and the countryside is thriving. Also, after the strict prohibition of opium cultivation, the prices of replacement agricultural products, although lower, are selling well and are enough to compensate for the price of opium. (2) Since the strict prohibition of opium, opium prices have soared, and the people of all counties have automatically quit and engaged in production.

<h3>Tianjin × Scheduled to Hold Anti-British Rally on July 7th The Blockade of the Concession is More Severe Than Before Poor Residents Face Difficult Living Conditions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Fourth Dispatch] Tianjin News: The entry and exit restrictions of the British and French concessions seem to have been tightened again, resulting in a sharp reduction in the amount of fresh food, dairy products, and coal transported into the concession, almost the same as the time when the blockade was most severe. The living conditions of the poor residents in the concession were originally extremely difficult, and the situation will be even more worrying from now on. "July 7th" is the anniversary of the start of the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese and their puppet accomplices originally scheduled to hold an anti-British rally here on this day and are now stepping up preparations. In addition, other parts of North China also plan to hold anti-British demonstrations separately to stir up trouble and demand the recovery of foreign concessions in China. Yesterday, various newspapers published anti-British remarks, and radio stations also broadcast anti-British news in the evening. The British and Japanese sides have scheduled negotiations in Tokyo within days. British expatriates here are closely monitoring the situation. British expatriate sentiment is generally very anxious on the one hand and very worried on the other. The general feeling is that if Britain compromises with Japan after Japan's display of its strength, it will greatly damage the prestige and future of Western countries in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Reuters Beijing Third Dispatch] According to Japanese official sources, anti-British rallies have been discovered in Linfen, Lishi, and Hongdong, Shanxi. After the church people in Linfen and Hongdong left, their properties were looted. The British personnel in the above three places are currently on their way back to Beijing. "The reason is probably due to the anti-British movement," it is said.</p>

<h3>Some British Expats in Fuzhou Unwilling to Evacuate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency London Fourth Dispatch] Yesterday, a member of the Lower House raised questions about the situation in Fuzhou. Undersecretary Butler replied that a plan has been decided to allow British expatriates in Fuzhou who voluntarily evacuate to leave calmly. Although there are no British warships there at present, the other side has agreed to allow British expatriates to pass completely before July 7. It is reported that foreign expatriates in Fuzhou still intend to reside there. Among them are eleven British expatriates. There are indeed similar situations in Wenzhou. The British government has fully expressed its attitude towards the matter. Another member of parliament asked whether the mountain government could decide on a plan to allow the British fleet to visit the Baltic Sea and Leningrad in the Soviet Union. The Undersecretary replied that the government has paid attention to this proposal, but in the short term, this move is unlikely to be practical.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Prepares Chinese Art Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Chairman Lin and Others Send Telegrams to Congratulate US Independence Day</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Fourth Dispatch] The fourth is US Independence Day. Chairman Lin of the National Government sent a telegram to President Roosevelt to congratulate him. The telegram reads as follows: To His Excellency President Roosevelt of the United States of America, on the occasion of your country's Independence Day, I, on behalf of the National Government and the Republic of China, sincerely extend my congratulations and wish you good health and prosperity to your country. The US Embassy in China notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year that it would not formally entertain guests. Minister Wang, Vice Minister Xu, and other officials sent greeting cards to congratulate.</p>
<h3>On the Suiyuan Arc</h3>
<p>— Kenuo</p>
<p>[Mingge News Agency Correspondence] If we draw a more extensive and detailed map of Suiyuan than usual, we can see that, starting from Wuyuan in the Hetao region, hundreds of schools northwest of Baotou, crossing the Yellow River, passing through the northern tip of the Ikzhao League bordering Datelat Banner and including the four regions of Baoming, then heading east to the portion of land in Tuoketuo County across the river from Shenmu, then stretching south to the Jungar League, and then heading further east to Qingshuihe, we can cut out an arc that is not very regular.</p>
<p>From this, we can clearly see:</p>
<p>(1) The real × troops scattered in Suiyuan number only a little over three thousand. Adding the unreliable puppet troops of De Wang and Li Shouxin numbering ten thousand, and with our various guerrilla bases exerting imperial rule, more troops will not be transferred here. On weekdays, the × troops in the border area are already stretched thin, and this time they are even more flustered.</p>
<p>(2) The strength of our troops stationed on this arc line is very strong. During the Yellow River ice barrier period, × troops were unable to transport ammunition and weapons across the ice. Currently, the Yellow River is vast and the waves are raging. The × troops will not dare to invade easily. If they venture to invade, they will definitely be shattered by the forces of the prepared net. They may not even have a way to retreat.</p>
<p>Especially since General Fu Zuoyi led his troops into western Suiyuan, the momentum of our army has become even more magnificent. With a certain place as the center, our political and military efforts are fiercely attacking the heads of the × people.</p>
<p>Turning back, let us talk about the eastern half of the arc: not only is Jungar Banner and Dongsheng in our grasp, but also a portion of Tuoketuo County and the land on the south bank of the Yellow River in Salacqi County are firmly defended by our soldiers. Besides the county seat, the only places occupied by the × troops are Shamaoying, Jiazihai, and Dachengxikou. However, under the pre-emptive strikes of our eastern guerrilla units, they have become chaotic--our army's guerrilla range, railway bridges destroyed, intercepted bridges, small and large victories, surrounding the people...</p>
<p>This arc, which is not very regular, has become our bastion of resistance.</p>
<h3>Toad Wants to Eat Swan Meat (Part 1) - Japanese Army Tempts and Coerces Us to Make Peace</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Japan, at the beginning of its rashly launched war of aggression, was arrogant and self-important, full of confidence that it could make our country yield in a few months. Now, the war has dragged on for two years, and the end is still nowhere in sight. Furthermore, the resistance wars on our northern and southern fronts are becoming stronger, and the evolving international situation is increasingly unfavorable to Japan. The Japanese warlords are panicking due to their internal weakness, and are trying to implement conspiracies and tricks from the spiritual aspect of our people. They scatter many colorful leaflets in various parts of Jin (Shanxi) and Shaanxi provinces and along the Yellow River defense line: either spreading rumors and threats, or using sweet words to entice, blatantly talking nonsense, all with the aim of instigating the people in our war zones to petition the government to make peace with them, these warlords who think they are benevolent and righteous. Unfortunately, clumsy hands can't play good tricks. The graphics and text depicted in these leaflets are ugly and full of jokes, truly not afraid of losing the face of Bushido and making the people of the world split their sides laughing. If you don't believe me, please read the following:</p>
<p>Laughable Absurdity of Boring Leaflets</p>
<p>A leaflet scattered by × people from airplanes in Shanxi province is as follows: on a Chinese map, many "dog skin plasters" are pasted on certain cities, with the note: "In Nanjing and other places, a new pro-Japanese and anti-communist government is established, creating a new world of peaceful and happy life. People, quickly break away from ×××, submit to the new government, and spend a happy new life (?)"</p>
<p>An ordinary person, precisely the 'people' that you, the leaflets, impertinently address, said to the reporter with indignation while pointing at such a leaflet: "No matter how beautifully it speaks, I get angry when I see those Japanese ××."</p>
<p>The × army also uses the name of the fake "Provisional Government" to distribute leaflets regarding the use of fake currency to obtain our Central Bank legal tender. First, they seem to beg like a grandson, almost lifting the "dear people" into the hall. Then, they half-reveal their intention to get their hands on the legal tender: for example, "Therefore, the 'government' has taken measures to prevent the 'dear people' from unexpected losses..." They spare no expense to auction off fake currency at a discount, deceiving the "dear people" into using legal tender to get rid of the fake currency. The impossibility of this wishful thinking is truly as the "dear people" of Shanxi said: to give them life and horses, it's better to be driven away and robbed. Are we worried that we have nowhere to put a few pieces of thin paper (legal tender)!</p>
<p>The × people want to disrupt our finance. In the occupied areas, they also sell a kind of currency, which is a fake coin from the Meiji era, with the words "Made as Currency" already printed on it, but now they are using it again to deceive themselves and others. At first, they forced our compatriots to accept it at a rate of two yuan per coin. Before long, the cunning × people took it back and used traitors to secretly operate in various places, forcing it on our compatriots at a price of several yuan per fake coin, claiming that it could be used as a "pass" or "amulet." Unexpectedly, later, those who were found by the × people to have this coin were falsely accused of being our plainclothes team, and were brutally tortured, forcing them to redeem themselves with heavy money. But no matter how strange it is, the legal tender will not grow wings and fly. It will automatically fly into the pockets of the × people to save the warriors the trouble of using surgery. This, of course, has the same wonderful effect as the intention of the aforementioned leaflet that "Therefore, the 'government' has taken measures to prevent the 'dear people' from unexpected losses."</p>
<p>Another leaflet spreads even more inconceivable rumors: "The Burma Road transportation is destroyed by the air force!" Burma is now a British territory. Which country's air force is said to have destroyed her road? Saying it is from Japan, it probably doesn't dare to; saying it is from Britain itself, it is even more unreasonable. The leaflet is just like an old woman cursing in the street with a bald head and a brainless mouth, which is really unpredictable!</p>
<p>Also, the Zhanggufeng Incident, which is almost coming to an end, almost everyone in the world knows who the troops of the Soviet Union and Japan bowed to and begged for mercy. However, the shameless propagandists are still holding on to the mangy leftover son produced by that battle to boast: "The Japanese army fought a great battle with the Red Army at Zhanggufeng, and the Red Army was defeated, exposing the inferiority of its mechanized troops!" On the leaflet with this slogan, there are also vivid illustrations of the embarrassing situation of the Soviet army's defeat. Goodness, isn't this playing the ridiculous drama of covering your ears while stealing a bell?</p>
<p>There are also several kinds of lithographed color illustrations, the content of which is also very absurd. For example, it is claimed that expelling [Japanese] from the occupied areas is a great immortal who is doing justice for Heaven by glorifying Japan's false occupation of China. On the contrary, all Chinese national heroes who resist Japan are described as ghosts and monsters with blue faces and green eyes! Haha! If this is used to deceive Japanese elementary school students, it may be possible to squeeze out some more candy money, but now it is mistakenly used to preach to our people. Isn't it equivalent to cursing one's father in front of his son? The hatred of killing one's father is irreconcilable, won't it further increase the enemy's hatred in our people's hearts?</p>
<p>This kind of large-format lithographed color book is quite expensive, so on the edge of the leaflet it is written that anyone who tears off this leaflet will be severely punished and will never be forgiven. However, these words are eventually seen by our brave soldiers and civilians, who tear off one for every one they see, and pass them on to the rear as laughing stock.</p>
<p>Incomprehensible Proclamations</p>
<p>There is also the so-called "Imperial Proclamation issued by Haseogi Naohiro, Chief of the Special Service Organ of the Great Japanese Army stationed in Taiyuan," which is particularly adorned with that large red seal of nine characters. The surface material of the seal, the color of the ink, is truly comparable to the golden-edged red lacquer [objects]. Presumably, the chief of the special service, who is like a monkey wearing a hat, has a bit of a misunderstanding, mistakenly believing that the effectiveness of the imperial proclamation depends entirely on the size of the red seal and the thickness of the ink. However, these are not important. The good stuff is still inside the proclamation:</p>
<p>"Investigating the politics of this province, everything is on the right track... No matter how anti-Japanese elements disrupt, I am afraid it will not help the overall situation." On the one hand, he boasts that politics is on the right track, and on the other hand, he says that anti-Japanese elements continue to disrupt, and uses the questioning tone of "I am afraid" to look forward to the overall situation. This is obviously slapping himself in the face. The following sentence says: "Those who wish to cooperate should swear to the military and political authorities near them to express their sincere support for the new regime, and to defeat the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and faithfully be pro-Japanese!" The beauty of its grammar is truly unspeakable; because faithful pro-Japanese elements are also among those to be defeated.</p>
<p>Another proclamation, issued by someone calling himself the "Commander of the Great Japanese Army in Yuci," only needs to have the words "in Yuci Great Japanese" taken out and the grammar of the former "Great Japanese stationed in Taiyuan" measured against it, and you can know that the two gentlemen are of the same ilk. The title of this proclamation is: "Telling the military and civilians in Shanxi Province who are trembling with hunger and cold due to Chiang's deceitful policies and inhumane behavior," the obscurity of which can truly confuse people's brains. The brilliance of its content is even worthy of creating a new era in invasion literature! For example: (To be continued)</p>

However, according to people from these countries here, Britain and France intend to satisfy the Soviet Union's demands and provide guarantees regardless of their opposition.</p>
<h3>No New Developments in Danzig - Polish Government to Issue Note - German Officials Exert Themselves to Cover Up</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons yesterday on the Danzig issue, saying that according to reliable sources, military measures are being carried out in the Free City of Danzig, which is very tense. Recently, there has been a large influx of Germans disguised as tourists to Danzig, and the number is increasing daily. At the same time, a local defense force, known as the Stormtroopers, has been established in the Free City. The Polish government has received a notification from the German government that the German cruiser "Königsberg" will visit Danzig from August 25 to 28. Regarding the development of the situation in Danzig, the British government is maintaining close contact with the Polish and French governments.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 4th) Polish diplomatic representative to Danzig, Chodacki, returned to Danzig today after staying here for a few days. It was announced here that the Polish government will send a new note to the Danzig Senate regarding "certain incidents found in Danzig territory."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Danzig, 4th] Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, recently returned here from Warsaw. It is generally believed that he intends to issue a statement explaining why the Danzig authorities violated the Danzig-Polish agreement, so many are eagerly awaiting it. However, it is also possible that this statement will be issued directly from Warsaw. "Also," the situation in Danzig remains extremely calm on the surface. The League of Nations High Commissioner to Danzig recently told a Reuters reporter that he is doing his best to maintain peace, and that the most dangerous thing is the wrong reporting of facts.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] German political circles discussed Chamberlain's speech on the Danzig issue with a Reuters interviewer tonight, saying that "Chamberlain should be more cautious about the source of his information." There have not been any illegal or extraordinary military activities in Danzig, but only the reorganization and expansion of its police, which is absolutely within Danzig's autonomy. It is true that a large number of German tourists are visiting Danzig, but it is a big mistake to point to them as disguised troops, as Chamberlain did. Senior officials of the National Socialist Party expressed surprise at Britain's continued use of "blank checks" to provoke Poland's "radical and arrogant behavior." They further said that the situation would be better if the British Labor Party had appealed to Poland instead of Germany. Officials were extremely angry at Britain's appeal, saying it was an act of inducing nationals to commit treason. Both the press and officials took a disdainful attitude towards the "fear" in Paris and London. However, no one denied that the fate of Danzig had been decided, and the only question was the timing. The key lies in the hands of Hitler alone.</p>
<h3>Bartlett Writes - Hitler Will Not Take Risks for Now</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] According to the opinion of Bartlett, the foreign affairs interviewer of the "News Chronicle," there will be no war over Danzig. The rumors of changes in Danzig last weekend were a test of Britain's reaction by the National Socialist Party. Bartlett pointed out that this reaction will induce Hitler to take his next adventure in other directions. He also believes that the Poles will do everything they can to avoid war, except for maintaining territorial integrity and national honor. "If the Danzig Senate decides to vote to return to Germany or declare Danzig residents as German citizens, the Polish government will probably not take any other action other than lodging an official protest, because any amendment to the Danzig constitution is illegal without the approval of the League of Nations. But when Poland's treaty rights in Danzig are interfered with, the Poles will stand up and resist." Regarding the future situation in Danzig, opinions are divided. The various newspapers are discussing Poland's offer to Danzig of a note requesting an explanation for the military measures. It is reported that the British Ambassador to Poland will fly back to Warsaw today after meeting with Halifax yesterday.</p>

<h3>Before Tokyo Negotiations - Japanese Side Asks for the Sky-High Price - Actually Wants Britain to Stop Aiding China - British Side Still Holds a Spirit of Compromise</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 4th] British Ambassador to Japan Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita today to discuss the agenda of the Tianjin issue conference and prepare everything. Craigie told reporters that he was neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the meeting. He will do his best to bring the talks to a satisfactory conclusion, and hopes that the Japanese side will also make the same efforts.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The attitude of the Japanese military towards the future negotiations between Britain and Japan was explained yesterday by a military spokesman. It is said that the Japanese army first demanded that Britain agree to stop aiding the Chiang Kai-shek government, otherwise the negotiations between the two countries would be meaningless. Britain should change its policy to adapt to the new situation in the Far East and should express its understanding of the attitude taken by the Japanese army in Tianjin. The spokesman solemnly stated that from the beginning of the blockade of Tianjin, all the steps taken by the local Japanese authorities have been fully approved and praised by senior officials in Tokyo.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] In the "Enlighten the People's Understanding of Britain" propaganda campaign here, a so-called Japanese Reform Party issued a declaration demanding that the Japanese government take a tougher attitude to deal with Britain, saying that the Japanese government should always remember that Britain and the Soviet Union are obstacles to Japan in carrying out its Far East mission. If Japan agrees to any concessions or leaves fundamental issues unresolved, the construction of a new order in East Asia will be doomed to failure.</p>
<p>House of Commons Questions Anglo-Japanese Disputes</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 3rd) Undersecretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Halifax has received a report regarding the death of British national Mr. Liddell, the principal of the Lester School of Technology in Shanghai, in a car accident. As for what action the government will take on this matter, it cannot be announced until it has been fully considered. However, the British Consul General in Shanghai has submitted a note to the Japanese Consul General, declaring a reservation of all rights. The Undersecretary then answered a question raised by Labour Party member Borlase regarding the establishment of the pseudo-Huaxing Bank and its impact on commerce, saying that the British government is closely monitoring the situation with the relevant departments. When asked about the four Chinese people who caused the Tianjin incident, the Undersecretary replied that the Tokyo negotiations are about to begin, and he cannot make any further statements other than the original announcement. Labour Party member Burke asked whether the British authorities would never hand over the four Chinese to the Japanese side unless they were proven to have committed murder. The Undersecretary replied that this is one of the issues to be discussed in the Tokyo negotiations, and denied that the British government had canceled its statement that it would not extradite the four Chinese unless proven guilty. Labour Party member Greenwood also requested the government to guarantee that the four Chinese would never be extradited to the Japanese side before the Tokyo negotiations were completed. Butler replied that the government had no intention of extraditing them before the negotiations. Regarding the situation on Gulangyu Island, Butler said that the new suggestions made by the Japanese Consul General to the Gulangyu Municipal Council are currently being considered. As for Fuzhou and Wenzhou, the British authorities have now prepared everything so that British expatriates who wish to leave can evacuate. Although there are no British ships at the mouth of the Minjiang River in Fuzhou, the Japanese Navy has agreed to prepare transportation to transport British expatriates who wish to evacuate by July 6. Foreign Secretary Halifax heard that foreign expatriates in Wenzhou had decided not to evacuate, including eleven British expatriates. Mr. Creech asked whether these ports had been blockaded. Undersecretary Butler replied that the actual blockade had been realized, and the British government's attitude towards this matter had also been clarified to the Japanese side.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] In view of the fact that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations are about to begin in Tokyo, Upper House member Lord Cecil, at the request of Foreign Secretary Halifax, temporarily postponed the question he had originally scheduled to raise in the Upper House on Thursday. The question was to require the government to report on the situation in the Far East. Once raised, it would inevitably cause a wide-ranging debate.</p>
<h3>Baltic States to Devalue Currencies - To Resist German Economic Power - Britain and France Exchanging Opinions</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency London, 2nd" Sources here claim that the countries in Central Europe, especially Poland and Romania, whose independence is guaranteed by Britain, will implement currency devaluation. The reason is that the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods produced in these countries are too high to compete with the products of the United States, Africa, the Scandinavian Peninsula, or the East. As a result, it is inevitable that they will establish goods exchange agreements with Germany and be controlled by German economic power. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the prices of various products as soon as possible, and currency devaluation will surely have the effect of adjustment. In addition, the freedom of Central European products to be transferred to countries with free exchange and the impact of import quotas have made it impossible to develop, which is also one of the reasons for the economic difficulties of Central European countries. In addition, there are various political factors that can also cause Central European countries to embark on the path of currency devaluation. The reason is that Poland and Romania have consulted with Britain on borrowing loans, but so far the British Treasury has only granted part of them, which the two Baltic countries consider insufficient. Poland said that it could not afford to buy raw materials needed for its military industry, while Romania said that it could not resist Germany's economic power. Experts from the British Department of Finance advocated lending money to the two Baltic countries to establish an exchange balance fund to maintain their currency status, while reducing the currency price to increase exports, and the money obtained could also increase prices in the industrial manufacturing and investment aspects. Regarding this matter, Britain and France are exchanging opinions with the governments of various related countries, and it is expected to be completed in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>British Aid China Association Launches "China Week"</h3>

Yesterday, the newspaper had an editorial written by the well-known novelist Plichta, which said that we must find a way to prevent British policy from benefiting the rapacious aggressors. On the contrary, we should make it aid the hardworking and persevering [Chinese people]. Yesterday, China News also published special articles by Chinese Chairman Chiang, [text missing] Consul General James, and leaders from India and Malaysia, with very vivid content. Also, a mass meeting is scheduled to be held here tomorrow, chaired by Sir Lee [text missing].</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>US Independence Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, July 4th, was the 163rd anniversary of the American Revolutionary War. At that time, the American people fought for liberation and freedom. After setbacks, they finally relied on the perseverance of the entire nation and its leaders and achieved final victory. Thus, the democratic, republic, free, and happy United States of America was born. Today, besides admiring the spirit of the American people shedding blood for freedom, we deeply feel that the American people's spirit of persisting in unity and fighting to the end is truly worthy of our emulation. Currently, North American democracy and freedom are also under threat from the fierce flames of fascist invaders. The heroic resistance of the Chinese nation has reached two years, and we especially hope that the two major nations will join hands closely and fight together! Furthermore, unite with friendly nations such as Britain and the Soviet Union to jointly defend democracy, peace, and justice and strike against the invaders.</p>
<h3>Mongol-Puppet War</h3>
<p>Yesterday's evening newspaper reported that the Mongol-puppet war is showing signs of escalating. The Soviet Union, in accordance with the mutual assistance agreement, is providing assistance to Outer Mongolia to resist Japanese provocation. Our North China armies, centered on the XX army, have launched a counter-offensive, and guerrilla warfare in the four northeastern provinces is also intensifying. If this news is reliable, it will naturally be beneficial to the war of resistance. The Japanese invasion force in China was already insufficient. Now, if they put on a show of strength on the international stage and "implement anti-Soviet" actions, only to find themselves unable to extricate themselves, then even if they are not completely annihilated, the result of reinforcing the north will be the emptying of the southern battlefield!</p>
<p>However, we must recognize that the Japanese will inevitably try their best to avoid a major war in the north. The current provocations are merely conspiracies before negotiations with Britain, and conspiracies before Wang's regime advances to form a puppet government. Therefore, we must not be too careless! We must prepare to meet the leaping operations of the X people, and we must step up our counter-offensive in central China and southern China, especially in the rear of the X people!</p>
<h3>Serving the Nation Through Prostitution</h3>
<p>The "Tourist Guide" agencies in Hong Kong have launched a "charitable guide" movement "in commemoration of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction", which is "resonating with a hundred responses" and is in full swing. We feel that the patriotic behavior of these "guide girls" should be as worthy of respect as the charitable sales of hawkers.</p>
<p>However, we have always been skeptical of this movement of "serving the nation through licentiousness"! We have always been skeptical that only elementary school students, hawkers, singing girls, and guide girls are passionately patriotic, while why is there so little news of wealthy businessmen generously donating ships? ×××××××××, this is the shame of the entire "upper class" society! This is especially the shame of the so-called ×× Chinese! Look in the mirror! What qualifications do you have to look down on these "lower class" people? Search your conscience! Can't you see the example of the Jews?</p>
<h3>Danzig and World Peace</h3>
<p>— Dong Ping</p>
<p>The original author of this article, Dr. Rauschning, was the former President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig; he resigned in November 1934 and is still a key member of the Nazi party. He has unique insights on the Danzig issue, which are by no means comparable to those of Forster and Ribbentrop. Moreover, from this article, it can be seen that justice is in the hearts of the people, and it cannot be completely covered up by Hitler alone.</p>
<p>The Danzig issue can be properly resolved. A fair resolution is sufficient to determine the peace of Europe; however, before proceeding with the resolution, all parties concerned must provide friendly guarantees.</p>
<p>Before Hitler came to power, the situation in Danzig had shown good signs. If the Nazis had not come to power, Danzig might have already been returned to Germany; because at that time, Europe would have laid a foundation for mutual cooperation under the General Military Conference and the peace treaty. However, the biggest difficulty now is that Europe has become a place of arms race and mutual hatred.</p>
<p>Indeed, before the war, Danzig belonged to Germany; and had ruled in this way for several centuries. However, another fact cannot be ignored; when Danzig belonged to Germany and Prussia, the country of Poland did not exist at the same time; naturally, there was no need for Danzig to serve as a seaport. At that time, most of Poland was subordinate to Russia, and Russia had its own seaports, so naturally there was no need to choose a free city. However, after the war, Poland was officially established, and she naturally needed a seaport.</p>
<p>Whether observed geographically or politically, Danzig is ultimately a whole. Germany and Poland cannot split it at all, because that kind of split will not only be unhelpful to peace, but will also cause explosions on both sides.</p>
<p>No matter how much the public Germans hope to be merged into Germany, the important thing is: if Danzig falls into the hands of imperialist Nazis, Danzig will definitely become an important naval base for Germany, which will fundamentally destroy Poland's only seaport in Gdynia, and completely block Poland's access to the sea. Finally, the Polish Corridor will be forced out of discussion. In this way, it is tantamount to dividing Polish territory and cutting off Poland's prospects on the world stage.</p>
<p>Therefore, Hitler's political means are the most unsuitable for solving the Danzig issue. Until today, his policy is still to incorporate the free city into Germany, on the grounds that Danzig has already been Germanized. However, since his occupation of Prague, this reason is no longer valid.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I had the opportunity to listen to the Führer personally explain the eastward policy—the so-called eastern space. That is, Germany wants to rule a series of semi-autonomous countries in the east, and control them with political and military alliances. They must serve as appendages and supporters of Germany's economic and political institutions. German rural areas completely obtain labor from foreign countries, and general precision work is assigned to the German people, so that superior German people can rule inferior semi-autonomous people, and achieve permanent order and peace in Eastern Europe. These semi-autonomous countries include the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and then Czechoslovakia. This is a political system that superficially resembles the League of Nations, but is completely under the oligarchy of Germany; it has become Hitler's diplomatic and political line. Moreover, since the establishment of the protectorates of Moravia and Bohemia, this plan has gradually unfolded.</p>
<p>Hitler completely agreed with this theory, but he slightly modified it for the border countries. He said that the artificial people of the border countries should be moved away, so that German farmers could migrate to colonize. At the same time, he pointed out that Moravia, Bohemia, Pomerania, Upper Silesia are extremely important areas, while Lithuania and the Baltic states, Hitler believes, are easier to control.</p>
<p>This plan is the real background for Hitler's demand to merge Danzig and build a highway in the Polish Corridor. His real purpose is not a free city of Danzig, but to implement the entire conquest plan. Destroying Poland, the only strong country in the east, is necessary. Poland must fall to the status of a medium-sized country, becoming a land of 15 million people. Hitler had already said when telling the German people: Germany must do everything possible to prevent another military power from being produced in its east. In terms of military factors, defeating Poland is Germany's most dominant and most urgent goal.</p>
<p>Some Germans naturally praised these plans enthusiastically. But as a whole, the public is really not interested. They oppose adding pressure to other countries and peoples, because the result of this plan is really the end of Eastern Europe. This may be a remedy for the excessive complexity of European countries, but the method is really too uncivilized, it is completely based on force and coercion.</p>
<p>Now, we cannot but honestly admit that countries and people all over the world are already tired of the quarrels of nationalism. Now is a good time to re-establish an international order, an order in which the League of Nations and passive collective security only completed the first step. The only way to stop the Nazi's military advance is to jointly declare respect for the independence and autonomy of some small countries. A federal organization of European countries, based on freedom and unity, will surely resist Hitler's military rule.</p>
<p>For six years, Europe has been in constant turmoil, entirely due to the danger of Hitler's policies. All treaties concluded with Germany not only failed to resolve disputes, but became a fuse for conflicts between the two sides. Even if the Danzig issue can be temporarily resolved now, it is just planting a fuse for the future, and the distance between this resolution and the next outbreak will not exceed six months at most.</p>

<h3>Secrets of a Tourist Guide - I am a Tourist Guide Girl</h3>
<p>How did I become a tourist guide girl? I was tricked into it. Before, I was helping with work in people's homes—to be honest, I used to be a maid, but the name "maid" is too inelegant and undignified. So, now, except in front of close friends like you, I absolutely refuse to reveal my past history.</p>
<p>Maybe, I am as people criticize me, "naturally flirtatious"! I helped several families, but I was soon fired by the female employers. The reason was always that I had too many boyfriends, but who doesn't know their narrow minds, isn't it because the male employer looked at me a few more times, and they got jealous and took such a cruel action?</p>
<p>In order not to suffer these grievances, relying on the fact that I also read a few books when I was young, I wanted to find a more noble job. At that time, a few friends introduced me to be a tourist guide girl. I asked them, is this a "noble" job? They said a lot of things, and I couldn't quite distinguish what they were, anyway, a hundred sentences always add up to one sentence: tourist guide girl is the most "noble" profession. This still couldn't move my heart. Later, one sentence made me wholeheartedly willing to be a tourist guide girl. Do you know what sentence? They said: The tourist guide business is so developed in "foreign countries", isn't it "noble"? Right, what foreigners do, I think is always "noble". In this way, I became a tourist guide girl.</p>
<p>The rule of our tourist guide agency for going out for "guiding" is one dollar per hour, but most customers don't "dare" to call us at home, they always go to hotels and restaurants. Therefore, out of our one dollar, we have to give two dimes to the waiters who call us. This money must not be saved or begrudged, because if you offend these "bloodsuckers", they will really make trouble, and you can forget about doing business there a second time. So, can I earn eight dimes per hour when I go out? Wait, wait, we still have to split it up, why don't the bosses of the tourist guide agency take money? Therefore, these eight dimes still have to be given to them. This splitting is of several types, depending on which level the tourist guide girl is. Most of them are split two-six, that is, the boss takes two dimes and she gets six dimes. There are also three-five, half-and-half, as for me, it's really infuriating, I have a two-six split, the boss takes six dimes, but I can only get two dimes. It is said that I am the lowest level, because, first, I am not beautiful enough! You must not believe his nonsense, I look in the mirror myself, and I am not much worse than those so-called top levels, maybe even better than them, but since ancient times, there have been too few people who know "goods"! Second, I can't dance. This statement should also be beaten. What is so difficult about dancing? Anyway, I am tall and strong. As long as I am happy to dance, I guarantee that I can pull the customer and dance around. Third, I have not attended elementary school for a year or two, and cannot pretend to be a female student - those damned guys! They have completely forgotten that I have recited the Three Character Classic and the Hundred Family Surnames, in short, if it weren't for my innate flirtatious energy, I would almost be rejected as a tourist guide girl, but let's not worry about that, let's talk about our situation when we go out. Those top-level girls mostly have some regular customers who often make calls or ask people to ask her by name, but sometimes they can't be separated, what should they do? Then it's my turn to go. The customer called her, regardless of the situation, I go. When I get there, the customer is of course surprised, what's going on, who changed the person? But I just pretend not to know and let them shout. If some customers honestly ask: I called so-and-so, why didn't she come, but you came? Then I pretend to be surprised and say, did you not call me? That must be that we heard the name wrong. If they ask my name, of course, my name is only different from the person he identified by a very difficult to distinguish tone, they naturally have no choice but to let me sit down or send me away, anyway, one dollar always has to be taken out, this thing is called: "Li Dai Tao Jiang."</p>
<p>Some people say that being a tourist guide girl is not as clean as being a maid, because earning money by physical strength is more "noble" than exchanging money by relying on enchanting charm. But now, we don't care about "nobility" anymore. I think that being a maid, being busy all day long, being clean is clean, but how can it compare to now, seeing people every day, who are managers, big bosses, bank clerks, etc., some high-class people. We have a good time with them, making them very happy. If you are a maid, although you have a clean heart, who cares about you! So, I think that anyway, those self-proclaimed dignified people love this tune, and we are happy to ignore what is clean, what is soul, and grab a few unjust dollars first. What do you say, am I right!</p>
<h3>One Person Per Day</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that German Iron Chancellor Bismarck was a famous swordsman and fencer.</p>
<p>Once, when old Bismarck was still young! He had a dispute with the then German scientist Virchow, for some reason. The standard soldier arrogantly proposed a duel: "You can choose the weapon."</p>
<p>Although Professor Virchow was buried in the laboratory and had no strength to restrain a chicken, he did not want to be outdone. He hardened his scalp and accepted the challenge and agreed to meet later.</p>
<p>The day of the duel finally arrived. The onlookers were worried about the weak Virchow, because he could not withstand Bismarck's blow. However, Professor Virchow calmly took out his weapon from his pocket and shouted loudly to the Iron Chancellor:</p>
<p>"These are two sandwiches, which are also the weapons for you and me to duel. One of them contains the most poisonous toxin. After eating it, I guarantee you won't survive, but the other one is absolutely harmless. Please choose one, and I will eat the other one. Our chances are exactly the same, this is absolutely fair. Come on! My friend!"</p>
<p>This time, the Iron Chancellor was frightened. Although he was a hero, he was not used to this kind of weapon after all. Finally, he had no choice but to smile and shake hands with Professor Virchow and cancel the scheduled duel. ·Bismarck·</p>
<p>Mr. Earth; Guide girl, please guide me to find a piece?</p>

<p>The Tokyo negotiations have not yet opened the curtain, but those who blow the trumpet, beat the gong, set up the scenery, and match the lights, are so busy that they forget everything, stopping aid to China, understanding the actions of the Japanese army, Tokyo approving, being tough on Britain... This can't help but remind people of Munich a year ago. Old Hee led two Gs, made a big battle, and finally caught a rainy X. Is he going to fish in the Far East again this time? Say it again: China is definitely not Czech,</p>
<p>Mr. Adolf Hitler, the Polish guards have already loaded their bullets, do you want to try one? Ha! You have also found the word "fear" in the dictionary, maybe you will open your mouth wide again; I don't want to do it now; I am setting up the scenery for Tokyo; "Okay, good for you,</p>

<h3>Small Problem</h3>
<p>Here is a very old story: Once upon a time, the wind was gentle and the sun was warm. King Solomon was walking in the Royal Garden. Passing by the flower bed, he heard a male butterfly say to his wife, "As long as his wings tremble slightly, the palace gate of King Solomon will be opened." King Solomon heard this and was greatly angered by what he was saying. He immediately returned to the palace to summon the ministers and ordered them to quickly capture and punish the butterfly who had no regard for the law. A few minutes later, the prisoner, whose face was pale and trembling all over, lay prostrate before the emperor. At the end of the trial, the butterfly confessed his guilt, but he requested the emperor to let him say one more sentence: "Dignified Emperor, you are also a married person yourself, can you guess why I want to say this to my wife?"</p>
<p>King Solomon deserves to be wise, and after a little thought, he understood. At the moment, he was very understanding and released the butterfly. It is said that after the male butterfly returned home, his wife asked him what it was like to see the emperor. The butterfly replied calmly and casually, "King Solomon asked me not to damage his palace."</p>
<p>Readers must be smarter than Solomon, can you guess why the male butterfly said this to his wife?</p>
<h3>Sea Forum 24</h3>

<p>Previous summary</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Hawkes Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, took advantage of the German ship to travel in Europe. Because Britain and Germany declared war, the British warship was going to intercept the ship. The ship escaped wildly. Easily escaped the tiger's mouth. Returned to American territory. Jack and Bill went back to New York to see Qiu. Qiu asked them to take the "Saint Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that the guy was a German spy named Raviki...</p>
<p>"I don't know any more than you. I haven't seen him since we parted at the station from White Port to New York. In fact, things went so fast that I didn't have time to think about him. He told me that he was going to catch the first ship to France."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's talk about old Fried Chicken again. Are you going to report him?"</p>
<p>"Who to report to?"</p>
<p>"Tell the captain right away."</p>
<p>"What's the point? He hasn't committed any crime. As long as he doesn't bother us, he's happy to travel under a changed name. We can't control him."</p>
<p>"That's true. However, even so, if another British cruiser comes up to investigate, I'm going to say a few words to him." Bill said worriedly.</p>
<p>"I hope to know who that Smith and Zhi is?"</p>
<p>"Is he on the passenger list?"</p>
<p>"No, otherwise, the officers from the 'Borwick' would have asked him. He paid special attention to names with German sounds."</p>
<p>"So," Bill nodded, "he is also taking a risk on this ship. I guess old Fried Chicken's friend must also have a name with an American sound, so that he can safely cross this ocean."</p>
<p>Before long, Jack returned to the radio room, where his berth was; as he approached the door of the radio room, the door was open, and some pale yellow light was coming from inside. Jack saw, or rather he thought, that there were two figures behind a lifeboat, but by the time he wanted to see clearly, they were gone.</p>
<p>At that time, Jack assumed that they were two sailors on the ship, but as they slipped through a passage door, they could see that they were wearing ordinary clothes, not the uniforms of the sailors.</p>
<p>"Strange." He said to himself, "These two people are hanging around the radio room, obviously with bad intentions; otherwise, why would they run away when they saw me coming. I'm willing to bet a cake of cooked cakes, those two guys must be old Fried Chicken, and his treasure who knows radio. Jack, old buddy, you have to open your eyes a little."</p>
<p>"Did you do anything?" He asked Malan as soon as he entered the radio room.</p>
<p>"Nothing, as quiet as the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year."</p>
<p>"Didn't you see any old friends of ours just now?"</p>
<p>"Who, Johnson? No, he hasn't been here."</p>
<p>Jack nodded, said good night, and went to sleep. However, as the ship sailed at night, his eyes were not willing to close as comfortably as usual and fall asleep.</p>
<p>He was busy with many things in his heart. Obviously, Raviki wanted some things in the radio. However, as far as Jack knew, what he heard behind the steam cylinder was just some words. He thought it was his responsibility to stop it.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Tea Management Methods</h3>
<p>— Feng He Fa</p>
<p>Last year, the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, upon orders, handled the unified sales of tea nationwide, establishing the initial foundation for wartime agricultural policy. This year, to fundamentally transform tea production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales, the Ministry of Finance submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for the promulgation of general organizational rules for tea industry management agencies in each province. These rules would enable the establishment of tea industry management agencies in each province to connect with the Trade Commission for further advancement. Zhejiang Province established the Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office in March of this year, collaborating with the Construction Department and central government agencies. While the internal details of each department differed, the tea aspect involved signing a loan-for-tea contract with the Trade Commission, tasking the Tea Department of the Management Office with handling improvements in production, manufacturing, and transportation. Director Wu of the Construction Department concurrently served as the office director, with Mr. Fei Hongnian and Mr. Liu Baochen as deputy directors. I was entrusted with overseeing the affairs of the Tea Department. Because the unified sales of tea had been the most effective special product since the war of resistance, Mr. Zou Bingwen and Mr. Wu Juenong of the Trade Commission had already formulated detailed plans for the overall transformation of the tea industry and its coordination with the war effort. Zhejiang tea industry management followed the established policy, taking into account local special circumstances, and gradually advanced. The general situation is outlined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Four Major Goals</p>
<p>Wartime tea industry policy has four goals: First, to secure materials as part of mobilizing material resources, with the aim of preventing them from falling into enemy hands and concentrating the scattered forces previously controlled by private individuals. Second, to enhance finance and earn foreign exchange, which is the concrete content of securing materials. This requires the government to coordinate transportation and sales and increase exports for success. Third, to stabilize rural areas and increase tea production to enrich the economic condition of farmers, balance various interests, and improve farmer organizations. This is not only required by wartime economic policy but also a method of promoting public organization. Fourth, to fundamentally transform the entire tea production system as a contribution to resisting aggression and building the nation. Under normal circumstances, countless man-made difficulties would obstruct the improvement of the tea industry. During this wartime period, some social evils disappear with the war, creating an opportunity for the tea industry to resist aggression and build the nation.</p>
<p>(2) Four Steps</p>
<p>The advancement of wartime tea industry policy, according to production steps, is divided into the following four stages: First, improve production and benefit farmers. Currently, tea farmers' planting of tea trees and picking of raw tea are extremely scattered and rudimentary, lacking technical knowledge. While this seems to be the main cause, it is actually because mountain prices are not guaranteed, making it difficult to profit, and poverty is a concern, making it difficult to expand production and improve technology. Therefore, the key to the problem is how to maintain good prices for raw tea and prevent exploitation. Second, secure tea factories and improve manufacturing. Because today's tea factories in various places are not only rudimentary but also often approach speculation, manufacturing intermittently without long-term plans, this is due to the failure to rationalize transportation and sales mechanisms and the lack of market guarantees. Factories that are exploited by intermediaries will inevitably pass on the burden to tea farmers, creating layer upon layer of exploitation, inevitably leading to mutual destruction. Third, reduce intermediaries and eliminate malpractices. The original comprador-like commission tea shops collude with foreign firms to oppress tea factories, with heavy malpractices and numerous items, and the decline of the tea industry is truly severe. Fourth, direct trade and increase exports. This is the final issue for commodity agricultural products. Without a sales market, improving the tea industry is out of the question. However, if direct trade is not possible and control remains with foreign firms, there is no way to expand the market. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Classical Chinese and Modern Chinese</h3>
<p>— Yang Jin Hao</p>
<p>The writing of an era expresses the spirit of that era. The content (views) and form (tone) of writing should conform to the spirit of the era; this has become common sense.</p>
<p>However, much of the writing popular in our country today has not even achieved this common sense. Some people are modern people, but they insist on using classical Chinese to write classical Chinese views. Some people use classical Chinese to write modern views, and some use modern Chinese to write ancient views. The first is equivalent to walking corpses, the second is equivalent to modern living ghosts, and the third is equivalent to the disguised makeup of mummies; none of them are worthy of being called true "modern Chinese" - the writing of the new era.</p>
<p>Currently, what is especially popular is a type of writing that has a modern soul but pretends to be a living ghost, making it difficult for people to understand. This is truly mocking oneself.</p>
<p>However, it would be fine if they were mocking themselves, but they just happen to occupy a considerable position in this society, forcing a group of energetic young people to spend a lot of energy trying to figure out those ghostly figures and even following them to create that ghostly sound. That is truly a lot of sin!</p>
<p>In order to save the energy of some cultural youths, to prevent them from wasting it on unnecessary paths, and to use it for deeper achievements, and at the same time, to allow the masses who do not have much money to learn the ancient tunes and tones to also be able to seek knowledge and express emotions; I want to ask the adults and gentlemen to eliminate the legacy of classical Chinese and expand the modern Chinese movement;</p>
<p>(1) The entrance exams for universities and middle schools should all be limited to writing in modern Chinese: that is, to use modern language to write modern views. Some Chinese language teachers in universities or high schools fully copy old antiques from the Four Books and Five Classics, and even the graders only look at classical Chinese test papers and not colloquial test papers. Such a habit of forcing young students to drive backwards must be eradicated!</p>
<p>(2) All official documents, whether reports, consultations, orders, approvals, especially government notices, orders, etc., should abolish all kinds of official stereotypes and use colloquial language.</p>
<p>(3) All applied writing in society, whether letters, contracts, advertisements, invitations, etc., should abolish all kinds of inherited conventions and completely use colloquial language.</p>
<p>(4) News and articles in newspapers and magazines should be written in colloquial language as a way to promote and popularize it.</p>
<p>Some people say that writing in classical Chinese is economical. In fact, this is not necessarily the case. For example, there is a telegram that says: "...this place believes that the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident is very slim..." If it is rewritten in colloquial language, it can be written as: "Here, it is believed that the hope of peacefully resolving the Tianjin incident is very small." Can't one word be saved? Many old antiques that groan without illness or are full of clichés, watching them shake their heads and wag their tails, cannot say a single reason, that is extremely uneconomical! Therefore, whether writing is economical depends on whether its content is substantial and whether speaking is verbose. Moreover, writing in colloquial language can save the author the effort of learning to read ancient Chinese and the effort of translating classical Chinese into colloquial language when reading. Isn't that much more economical than writing in classical Chinese?</p>
<p>The "Literary Revolution" and "Revolutionary Literature" have been advocated for more than 20 years, but there are still many young students who want to read classical Chinese and learn classical Chinese; and our country's education has not yet been truly popularized; this is entirely because the new antique - classical Chinese - is at work in society. Therefore, education directors, government officials, and leaders from all walks of life should issue decrees or advocate modern Chinese as soon as possible. So that those new antiques lose their basis in society, then modern Chinese that conforms to the spirit of the times will naturally rise and become popular, and the "Literary Revolution" and "Revolutionary Literature" will naturally achieve further victories.</p>
<p>Although the above is a rehash of old ideas, it is still worth shouting loudly. I hope everyone "knows and acts", and gets down to business in a practical way.</p>
<h3>The Armed Forces of the People</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>...War Zone Diary...</p>
<p>From Shangcheng to Anhui, there are two roads to take: one from Yuzidian to Huishan Mountain, passing through Siduohe for twenty li, which is the territory of Anhui. This is a relatively flat main road; the other is from Siguadun to Suxianshi, crossing Huangtu Ridge to reach Zaoxuehe. This is the shortest shortcut, but the road is winding and the mountain slopes are steep, making it impossible to travel without walking. We arrived in Shangcheng from Songbu at around 9 p.m. Although we had a truck from the military supervision department as transportation, we still had to get out of the car and wade through the vast stone beaches where mountain water converged. Otherwise, if the wheels played tricks on the rocks, you would definitely have to hold a "water ceremony."</p>
<p>That night, we stayed at the Dahua Hotel next to the county government. It was considered the leading hotel in Shangcheng, with paper windows, uneven dirt floors, and dilapidated bamboo beds, all of which preserved the style of the Middle Ages. However, the inferiority of material conditions can reflect the simplicity of social life. The perseverance of the people of Central Plains can be seen here. Moreover, the people are tough. Since this organization, training, and the infusion of political common sense, they are all eager to defend their homeland, preparing to shed their blood.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Naiqi of the Anhui Provincial Committee also stayed in Shangcheng that day. This well-known national fighter was returning to Anhui from Wuhan, passing through here, so we met. He wore a set of worn gray cloth uniforms and paced back and forth in the yard. No one knew that he was a high-ranking official.</p>
<p>"Ah, where are you going?" He seemed a little surprised.</p>
<p>"Anhui," I replied, "Going to western Anhui." I immediately added.</p>
<p>"Then let's travel together?"</p>
<p>"No, we may want to go to Xinyang for investigation."</p>
<p>Then, he told us about the mobilization work of the people here, expressing great satisfaction and excitement. He said that the 150-li mountain road into Anhui could only be traversed on foot, because western Anhui was short of both salt and rice, and it was necessary to move the people to prepare for a rainy day, so hiring a sedan chair was absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Somehow, County Magistrate Chen Shouchang actually discovered Mr. Zhang's arrival and came to Dahua early the next morning to invite him to give a speech. We were also invited along. After the speech, we toured the entire city. This ancient county town on the Henan border is less than ten li in circumference. Because it is located in the war zone, the streets appear very quiet, but the people's emotions towards the war of resistance are extremely tense, which can certainly be proven by the impression gained from the lecture meeting. It is said that the six counties formerly under the jurisdiction of Guangzhou, Henan, have been plagued by bandits for years, and the people's defense work has always been done very well. The baojia system is also quite complete. Once the mobile war begins, the people's armed forces of Shangcheng will immediately come into play to undertake the defense of western Anhui, which is more than enough. To prove this, Shangcheng has been occupied for half a year. However, the iron cavalry has never crossed the Zaoxuehe River a step. Although relying on natural barriers, it also relies on human power. Who says political work is not important?</p>
<h3>On the Banks of the Don River</h3>
<p>— Zeng Zhaojun</p>
<p>The Don River flows quietly southward, and the half-full moon stretches its face to look at the water. The dark green ripples slowly oscillate, as if trying to carry the moonlit color on the water away.</p>
<p>The two banks under the starry sky are as desolate as if they were asleep, and the sound of fallen flowers touching the water surface can be heard clearly.</p>
<p>But when a light yellow speedboat speeds along the river with a "rumble, rumble," the surrounding silence is broken. Standing and sitting in the boat are about forty people, wearing white uniforms and large collars edged with blue.</p>
<p>"This is damn Xi Wu water, both iron and fishy! I'm dying of thirst!" one said. "Alas! Thirst is not a big deal. Hunger is even more unbearable! Look, along the river, it is full of smoke, desolate and indifferent! People have all run away, where can you find something to eat? Alas! Alas! I'm going to starve to death!" another said.</p>
<p>"Brothers, don't quarrel!" One, who seemed to be a captain, stood up and pointed his left hand to the east, "The village over there seems to have people, let's go there and try our luck."</p>
<p>When the hull of the speedboat touched the shore, more than forty strong men rushed ashore like a flock of white geese being driven. Almost the entire village was walked through, and all that was in front of them was broken tiles and rubble and vague flesh and blood. Nothing else could be seen.</p>
<p>A group of disappointed people walked very slowly, sighing and complaining to each other. Suddenly, from behind several charred ancient pines in the county, came a subtle, miserable sob.</p>
<p>"Everyone listen, isn't this the sound of a woman crying?" the captain said, standing still. He ran with the sound, taking three steps in two. Sure enough, his guess was correct. Behind the pine trees was a woman with disheveled hair and a haggard face. She was sitting cross-legged on a large pile of dry straw, holding a small baby in her arms.</p>
<p>"Hey, are you a spy! What are you doing sitting here alone?" the captain asked in a fierce voice.</p>
<p>"Ah! Gods and Bodhisattvas!" The woman showed a flustered expression, "I... I am not a spy! I am a refugee who has run from afar. I beg you not to be so loud, I'm afraid it will frighten my child!"</p>
<p>"What are you sitting on? Get out of the way and let me check!"</p>
<p>"My cheeks are very sour, can't you just not check?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about! Get out of the way!"</p>
<p>The woman hugged the child and stood up with trembling legs. She fell down again! The captain couldn't wait any longer, jumped up and pushed her away with a palm, and then several people walked up and turned over the straw. What was covered? It turned out to be two roasted pig legs; a jar of clear old wine.</p>
<p>The captain smiled and winked at the woman: "Good, I didn't expect you, woman, to be our savior. However, these things--" He bent over and teased the pig legs, "Are they reliable?"</p>
<p>"Hahaha!" The woman suddenly laughed, "You suspect that these things have been poisoned? Anyway, you have already seen them, so I don't need to hide it. These things were all brought from my husband's hometown, prepared to honor my mother's family. I didn't expect to come here, but what greeted me was a changed homeland, parents!" She cried again.</p>
<p>"Captain!" A noisy shout, "What are you talking nonsense with her for, quickly divide the things and eat them! We are all starving to death!"</p>
<p>"Don't be noisy!" The captain turned his head and swept a majestic gaze at the soldiers, then turned to the woman and said, "Sister-in-law, since that's the case, it's cheaper for us, but it's not good for us to eat yours for nothing!" - "He untied the white scoop from his waist and poured a scoop of old wine to the brim, "Let me first offer you a cup."</p>
<p>"Good, good, good, the official's heart is good." She took the wine and drank it all.</p>
<p>"Hey! Captain! She has eaten it herself! Can't we eat it?" It was another burst of greedy cries.</p>
<p>"Don't make trouble!" The captain ordered a second time. He poured half a scoop of wine for the woman again, "Let this little child have a little too. His face doesn't look good, and eating it will make him look ruddy."</p>
<p>The woman took the wine, hesitated slightly, and sent it to the child inside. Everyone didn't notice that her hand was constantly shaking.</p>
<p>After the child finished the wine, the soldiers came up to pick up things to eat without waiting for the captain's order. The captain was also relieved this time, tearing the pig's leg and stuffing it into his mouth. Just as he was devouring it, the woman's crying came again.</p>
<p>"Why has your child turned blue? Ah! Is he dead?" the captain jumped up and asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, he is dead! He died for the country and the nation!" The woman said with passion, "The lives of our mother and child have been exchanged for the lives of more than forty enemies, this is... this is... worth it!" She couldn't support herself a bit. She said with her last breath, "Listen, you murderers of mankind! We will meet in the underworld, and we will always be 'enemies'!"</p>
<h3>Slacking Off</h3>
<p>— Jia Jie</p>
<p>Friend, I often hear people say: "No retreat, no rest." Especially since you have already embarked on the path of truth.</p>
<p>Loneliness and depression tightly surround us, almost suffocating us to death. We live a prison-like life, shouting and complaining as much as we can, but who will pity us and release us?</p>
<p>At least we have never covered our faces and wept, and we have never grasped the approach of death: we are wholeheartedly looking for a way out.</p>
<p>Although not as good as the release of a wild beast, it can be regarded as a fledgling bird spreading its wings, allowing the free sky to fly. The road has been found, we have already begun to embark on it, and nothing will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The process may be bitter, but this is a new advent. I believe there are countless things that can encourage and excite us. Friend, you seem to have thought of this too!</p>
<p>I don't understand why you have to look back again and again, what is worth clinging to in a prison-like life? A happy material and comfortable enjoyment, friend, that is poison!</p>
<p>You are hesitating again, although you do not admit that this is a retreat or a rest, but you are slacking off, and your spirit will be decadent. There is no way to recover.</p>
<p>People who live a comfortable life as slaves forever are waving to you. I understand that they have seduced you, but we have shouted and complained, have you forgotten that?</p>
<p>Your will may be at war, or you may have decided to turn back, your actions have been so slack. Friend, please recognize it for a moment!</p>
<p>Since we have embarked on the path of truth, how can we bear to separate halfway, let us join hands and move forward!</p>

<h3>Charging Towards the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>—Still a Story of a Girl—</p>
<p>Qingzhi deliberately pointed out the people outside to let Jingwen hear, she looked! Outside, Sui leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes again. Suddenly she opened her eyes wide and asked:</p>
<p>"When can we get to Guangzhou?"</p>
<p>"We should get there today."</p>
<p>Qingzhi answered intentionally or unintentionally. Thinking of Guangzhou, it gave her infinitely rich fantasies. She remembered how many years ago, young people went to Guangzhou just like going to northern Shaanxi now. Although the storms of many years have damaged its original nature, that place still has many stubborn and bloody people that she knows well.</p>
<p>The car kept rushing, finally roaring loudly like a victory, and the speed gradually slowed down. The train passed the fork in the road, shaking and angrily breaking into the platform. (To be continued)</p>

As the time of departure is approaching, the group has sent letters to various overseas Chinese groups, stating: "The Sino-Japanese War has been going on for two years.

<h3>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Election Closed Yesterday, The New Directors Can Be Announced Today, The Election This Time is Not as Enthusiastic as the Previous One</h3>
<p>The election of the 14th new staff members of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce was sealed in the ballot box at 5 pm yesterday, and voting was closed.

<h3>The Number of Cholera Cases in Hong Kong Has Reached 258, The Disease is Also Spreading Widely in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>In the thirteen days up to last Sunday, there were 19 cases of cholera, 11 cases of typhoid fever, 6 cases of measles, 2 cases of meningitis, 8 cases of dysentery, and 72 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in Hong Kong. The number of cholera cases this year has now reached 258. At the same time, the cholera epidemic in Guangzhou is also extremely widespread. According to the "puppet authorities," 70 people died from this disease in June, and there are still many unreported cases. It is believed that the actual number is definitely not this number. The × side has now forced residents to be vaccinated. It is claimed that from May 14 to June 15, about 349,070 people were vaccinated in one month. If this statement is true, then the shortage of the population of Guangzhou can be imagined. The cholera epidemic in Jiujiang City is also spreading gradually. On October 24, the × party sent military districts to the countryside to be responsible for vaccination. Those villagers who were unwilling to be vaccinated were driven to Heshan and were not allowed to return to Jiujiang.</p>

<h3>The Robbery Case on Li Yuen Street East Was Formally Indicted Yesterday, Continued Trial at 2:30 PM Today</h3>
<p>On October 5th, Zhang Da of Zhongde Bank went to the Overseas Chinese Bank to withdraw 500 yuan in soft currency. When he returned through Li Yuen Street East in Central, he was attacked by two bandits. At that time, two Chinese detectives, Song Jingwen, passed by and immediately arrested the bandits. Unexpectedly, the bandits pulled out their pistols and fired at Yin Wen. Tan Song saw the situation and immediately chased the bandits desperately. As a result, the bandit who committed the crime was shot dead by Tan on the way. Several passers-by were injured by stray bullets. Chinese detective Yin Wen also died of his injuries in the hospital on the 11th of last month. Wen Zhu, one of the robbers who was arrested on the spot, was immediately charged with the case and has been tried by the Central Patrol Court. At 2:30 pm yesterday, the case was formally indicted by the Justice. The British helper He Jian was in charge of the prosecution and charged with the crimes of (1) conspiring with the deceased Lin Ya Fang to beat Zhang Da and attempt to rob, (2) privately possessing a pistol and five bullets without a license. The trial situation is recorded below. After the court session began, the British helper He Jian stated the cause of the case and presented many photos taken at the scene of the incident that day as evidence. Then, the government photographer and photographer testified one after another on the location where the pictures were taken and what they saw on the day. Later, the national mortuary number officer testified on the autopsy of the bandit Lin Ya Fang who was shot and killed that day, and presented the deceased's clothes, shoes, shoelaces, etc. as evidence. Then, the resident doctor of the Maryknoll Hospital testified on the death of Detective Su Yin Zhang in the hospital due to injuries. Then, Zhang Da, the victim of the robbery that day, recounted the robbery in detail, saying, "On the morning of the 5th of last month, after I withdrew money from the Overseas Chinese Bank and left, I walked towards this place. I walked on the left side of the sidewalk and turned into Li Yuen Street East. Suddenly, a bandit put his arm around my neck from behind. I immediately felt a sharp pain and struggled desperately, but another bandit sprinkled chili powder on my eyes and forcibly opened my western-style coat to rob me from my arms. But I firmly held the front collar of the bandit, and he wanted to break free from me, so I shouted for help. Later, I heard gunshots, and the bandit tried his best to break free and left. The tie was torn off by me in my hand (blue), the tie was presented in court), and ran towards Dama Road. I then followed him, but because my eyes were blinded by the chili powder, I could barely support myself and could not chase him. I turned into Zhonghua Pharmacy at 82 Avenue Central and asked pharmacist Chen Wenzhu to wash my eyes." Next, Chen Wenzhu, the pharmacist of Zhonghua Pharmacy, testified that Zhang Da did come to the pharmacy to request washing on the day, and what he suffered in his eyes was indeed chili powder. After that, a child (16 years old) who set up a stall on Li Yuen Street East testified that on the morning of that day, he saw two men, one wearing a Chinese eye and one wearing a Western suit, acting like a robbery on a young man wearing a Western suit, and saw that the young man's face and eyes were covered with white powder. Afterwards, he saw a gunshot and fell to the ground. Then, the two men fled along the tram road. Shortly afterwards, there were three more gunshots, and he didn't know what happened afterwards. After the official listened to all the testimonies, he ordered that the case be adjourned until 2:30 pm today for continued trial.</p>

<h3>Various Social Organizations Commemorate "July 7th", The Tour Guide Association Promotes "Charity Guidance", Soldiers Shed Blood on the Battlefield, Risking Their Lives, How Can the People Bear to Live in a Drunken Dream at This Moment?</h3>
<p>Recently, various tour guide associations have made a special tour guide campaign for the upcoming "July 7th," and one singing leads to a hundred responses, like tea and fire, which is not enough to indicate the solemn and sacred concept of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance. According to the investigation, the general red tour guide girls have been recruiting their "acquaintances" for support, hoping to obtain the most "charity guide" income on that day and win the "charity guide" championship "honor." At the same time, the general group of people who live in a drunken dream have also released their horses and prepared to show their courtesy under the pomegranate skirt. From their appearance, the tour guide circle, whether it is the boss, tour guide girl, or employed tour guide, has a sincerity of patriotism that makes us admire and cannot be faulted. However, if we make further exploration, we know that it is in the name of saving the country, taking pleasure in reality. Even if all the proceeds are allocated to the authorities, the country's financial gains are limited, but the spiritual decline of the people fundamentally affects the strength of the war of resistance. The actual loss suffered by the country is beyond words. Moreover, what is decided to be allocated is only a part of the "charity guide" income. How can this be compared to the soldiers and compatriots who shed blood in front and die for the country? At this time when the survival of the nation is at stake, is it different from this kind of "charity guide" that leads people to prostitution and depravity? In addition to serving the country, is there no other way? The country's steps are dangerous, and overseas compatriots live in ease and joy, and should all know what to fight. In this solemn and sacred anniversary of the second anniversary of the war of resistance, we can encourage each other to increase the country's strength in the war of resistance, and we must not abandon ourselves and shame the nation. Hong Kong is a mixed place for Chinese and foreigners, and it is a place where international attention is focused. Every advance and retreat should be based on the country as a prerequisite. If there is only personal interest in mind, it is even better to claim to serve the country to gain the sympathy of the society and achieve its base profit goals, then no matter how subtle and sensational the propaganda methods are, Hong Kong overseas Chinese who respect themselves should not distinguish between black and white and not let their selfish plans succeed. In this way, on the one hand, it will benefit people's hearts, and on the other hand, it will also increase the strength of the war of resistance. If it is necessary to give "charity guide" assistance so that the country can get more income, it will not only be useless but also cause the country to suffer. It is hoped that the central government's resident guidance commissioner in Hong Kong will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>International Friends Raise Funds for Us, Coolies Thoroughly for the Country, The Tide of National Salvation is in Singapore</p>
<h3>Mr. Cheng Boyong's Urgent Trip Back to Chaozhou to Provide Relief - A Conversation Upon Arrival in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper: Three Ambulances Donated</p>
<p>Mr. W. Rasathury, an Indian national, is a rare international friend who fully sympathizes with our country's resistance against Japan. In his forties, he is a robust man. He works as a civil servant in the Kuala Lumpur government, responsible for issuing rubber licenses. He has extensive social connections and close ties with our overseas Chinese compatriots. He possesses a high degree of awareness and deeply understands that China's war of resistance is for the sake of global justice and righteousness, and that ultimate victory will inevitably come. Therefore, he utilized his position and social talents to painstakingly raise over ten thousand Singapore dollars, which he has already used to purchase three ambulances, fully stocked with medicine, and handed over to the Singapore Relief Association. These will soon be transported to China for emergency aid. This act has moved many Chinese and Western individuals. How can those Chinese who have money but do not donate have the face to meet this transnational international friend? We should thank this passionate friend with a sense of justice and offer him our great and lofty respect.</p>
<p>Sixty-Odd Dollars for a Bowl of Noodles</p>
<p>In a bustling charity bazaar in Singapore, miracles that move people to tears happen constantly.</p>
<p>There was a coolie, drenched in sweat. His short clothes, thick calves, and robust physique were all signs of hard work and poverty. However, he possessed a spiritual core and a strong sense of national identity. He was an outstanding descendant of the Chinese nation. He quietly rummaged through his waistband and finally took out sixty-odd Singapore dollars, tightly bound together. He bought a bowl of charity noodles and ate it with great satisfaction. This bowl of noodles represented the price of his entire fortune, earned with countless drops of blood and sweat, and saved over a long period. However, for the great glory of his motherland and to break the shackles on his body, he did not hesitate to do so. This is just one example. Who are the main forces of our national revolution? Here, we can find a concrete answer.</p>
<p>The Story of the Ears</p>
<p>The boycott of enemy goods is genuinely and strictly enforced in Singapore. Organizations have their own discipline, and various trades have their own investigation methods. Anyone who buys and sells enemy goods against their conscience will be severely punished. Enemy goods are virtually nonexistent in Singapore. The anti-Japanese sentiment is, needless to say, very intense. Recently, Wang Jingwei's henchmen have begun to be active there, spreading the poison of "peace." Overseas Chinese organizations are already on high alert. If anyone is found to violate the central government's national policy or the leader's pronouncements, they will be unceremoniously deported.</p>

<p>× Elements Go to Extremes in Inciting Discord</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about saving their country. The only drawback is that factional strife has not been overcome. Many frictions, disputes, misunderstandings, and losses arise from this. It seems that the division between the two factions of, for example, prominent overseas Chinese figures so-and-so and so-and-so, is still very deep. Fortunately, one of the leaders of these two factions has obtained conclusive evidence and suddenly realized that it was × people who were inciting discord and fueling the flames. Abandoning past grievances, reaching an understanding, and strengthening unity have become very likely trends. We will see if × people's endless conspiracies and attempts to infiltrate everywhere will end in failure.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Boyong Rushes Back to Chaozhou to Develop Relief Work</p>
<p>The above is what Mr. Cheng Boyong told reporters yesterday in Hong Kong after rushing back to Chaozhou from Singapore. Mr. Cheng is the president of the Chaozhou Red Cross. Since the outbreak of the war, he has been enthusiastically training relief personnel. He currently also serves as the captain of the Chaozhou Red Cross rescue team and the captain of the Chao'an District Air Defense Command's rescue brigade. To develop relief work, Mr. Cheng went to Southeast Asia two months ago to raise funds. He has now raised over ten thousand national dollars. In Singapore, upon hearing the news of the Chaozhou-Shantou Incident, Mr. Cheng, feeling responsible, immediately set off for Chaozhou to lead over two thousand trained rescuers in carrying out widespread relief work. Mr. Cheng arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and plans to detour to a certain place where the Chao'an military and political authorities have retreated to, in order to facilitate planning. Mr. Cheng witnessed the enthusiastic fundraising efforts of the Chaozhou overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia to provide relief to their hometowns. Yesterday, upon arriving in Hong Kong, he also saw many young people from Chaozhou requesting to return to their hometowns with him to serve. Moved by this, Mr. Cheng will certainly return to Chaozhou and Shantou to encourage his compatriots to work together in the same boat, with one heart and one mind, to share the difficulties and create a new life together.</p>

<h3>The Tung Wah Hospital Board of Directors is in a Difficult Situation - No One is Willing to Take Office Due to the Poor Economic Environment</h3>
<p>The handover between the old and new directors of Tung Wah Hospital is usually scheduled to take place in the first month of the lunar calendar. However, in recent years, due to the poor economic environment, no one has been willing to take office as a director of the hospital. In the past two years, it has taken great effort to overcome this difficulty. However, this year's situation is even more difficult. Although the former directors of the hospital have made many efforts to solicit candidates, more than five months have passed, and the number of directors is still not sufficient. So far, only five people have been secured: Zhang Zihang, Yang Yongkang, Chen Bosun, Han Runlin, and Yu Xisheng. Mr. Yu is the most recent addition. As for Mr. Deng Zhiqing, although he initially agreed to take office, he recently withdrew his agreement. Therefore, there are still only five people, more than half the original target of eleven. The handover date remains indefinitely postponed.</p>

<h3>Telephone Company Adds Underground Cables in the Central District to Meet Demand - The Number of Telephones in Hong Kong Currently Exceeds 20,000 - Electric Company Expands its Power Plant to Supply Electricity</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the population of Hong Kong has increased, and the number of telephone users has also increased accordingly. As of today, the number of telephones has increased to over 20,000, whereas five years ago, it was only 11,000. The area with the largest increase in telephones is the Central District. All the newly installed underground cables were exhausted two months ago. To meet the demand of residents, the company has completed the installation of a new cable. However, many new telephones installed in the Central District cannot be connected due to the lack of underground cable connections. The electricity supply problem has also been affected. The main power plant of the Electric Company on the sixth floor of the Exchange Building has recently experienced a supply shortage due to the increase in telephone users, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. The electricity supply is insufficient, and outages occur frequently. Therefore, a new generator unit has been added to the power plant, which is expected to be completed by the end of the month. In the future, the electricity supply should be sufficient.</p>

<h3>The Construction Department Concentrates Talent - Develops Inland Industry - Implements Industrial Revitalization to Promote Production in the Rear Areas</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Express) Zhu Hui, Director of the Department of Construction, recently inspected the Eastern Road Provincial Highway with Chen Song, Director of the Highway Administration. He returned to Shaoguan at the end of June. On the 30th, he told reporters about his inspection and the various construction matters under consideration:</p>
<p>Organizing Transportation</p>
<p>He said that during this inspection, he made detailed inspections of the counties and cities along the Chao-Shao Highway, such as Wengyuan, Lianping, Heyuan, Longchuan, Xingning, Wuhua, Fengshun, and Jieyang. He intended to formulate methods for reorganizing transportation. However, after the × invasion of Chaozhou and Shantou, circumstances changed, and each section was destroyed to adapt to the current needs. In the future, the direction of reorganization of the Eastern Road must take into account the environment before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Supporting Agriculture</p>
<p>Secondly, with regard to production, the focus is on supporting rural areas. To improve farming and increase agricultural production, the most important thing is to rotate rural finance. It is initially planned that the Department will provide farmers' loans. This matter has now been ordered to be handled by the Finance Department. As for rural cooperatives, they will be jointly operated by the Department and the Central Agricultural Credit Administration. The plan is being drafted to ensure that the province's agriculture is properly developed during the war.</p>
<p>Developing Industry</p>
<p>The development of inland light industry was in principle decided earlier by the National Production Conference. The province is currently considering it. The issue of iron and various raw materials will soon be specifically resolved. The Industrial Management Office of the Department has telegraphed the directors and technicians of the provincial factories to come to Shaoguan to clean up past factory affairs and concentrate people in villages as a basis for industrial development. At the same time, matters related to the relief of righteous people will be carried out to implement industrial revitalization, promote production in the rear areas, and achieve multiple benefits in one fell swoop. The Department will do its best.</p>

<h3>Various Locations in Northern Guangdong Suffered Bombing Raids by × Planes for Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Air News] Since May 29th, when × planes heavily bombed Shaoguan, resulting in over a hundred casualties and extensive damage to buildings, there had been a relatively peaceful period for over ten days. Unexpectedly, on June 24th and 25th, × planes once again flew to Shaoguan, causing havoc. On the 24th, at 10:08 AM, three × planes were detected flying south from Ganzhou towards Qujiang, triggering the first air raid alert. At 10:23 AM, a second batch of six × planes flew north from Fogang, then reached Ganzhou and dropped multiple bombs. At 10:00 AM, the second batch of six × planes were again spotted over Xin Feng, subsequently flying to the vicinity of Wengyuan and dropping bombs. At 12:50 PM, two of the six planes from the second batch intruded into the city airspace from northern Shaoguan. After being fiercely attacked by our anti-aircraft guns, they flew south at high altitude.

<h3>Wimbledon Tennis Singles Quarterfinals Today: Austin Loses in Straight Sets to Cochet; All Eight Remaining Women are Seeded Players</h3>
<p>The Wimbledon Tennis Championships, after a day of rest, continued on Monday in pleasant weather. The players, having rested and recuperated, showed greater enthusiasm, and the competition entered a critical stage. However, by the end of the competition, the situation differed significantly from what was predicted. In particular, Austin's elimination and loss of his quarterfinal qualification were completely unexpected. A summary of the situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Austin: Past His Prime, Loses to Cochet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Men's Singles Quarterfinals, and the already devalued Austin experienced a tragedy in this match. Austin's opponent was Cochet (USA), who was unceremonious and eliminated the last remaining British player in the Men's Singles in straight sets. The result was 6-3, 6-0, 6-1, further demonstrating the ease of Cochet's victory and the defeat of Austin.</p>
<p>The entire match lasted only three quarters of an hour, and Austin seemed to have lost his former brilliance. Although he occasionally displayed brilliant performances with angled shots, his overall technique felt like he was "past his prime."</p>
<h3>Three Newcomers All Eliminated</h3>
<p>Another unexpected "easy victory" was Pansegrouw (South Africa)'s defeat of Smith (USA). Smith had defeated many famous players in previous matches, but yesterday's loss was his Waterloo in Wimbledon. He was eliminated by the South African hero with a score of 6-0, 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>The other two matches were Riggs (USA) against Muhammad (India) and Henkel (Germany) against Cocarjevic (South Africa). Riggs is currently one of the favorites for the title, and Muhammad's experience is far below Riggs', so his defeat was expected. The result of the match was 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>Henkel (Germany)'s match against Cocarjevic (South Africa) was won by Henkel, but detailed results have not been telegraphed. It is assumed that it was more dramatic than the other three matches.</p>
<h3>Last Four Players in Quarterfinals Today</h3>
<p>The semifinals were completely concluded yesterday. The four players remaining in the quarterfinals from the one hundred and twenty who participated at the start are Riggs, Pansegrouw, Henkel, and Cochet. Today, in the quarterfinals, Pansegrouw will face Riggs, and Henkel will face Cochet. The quarterfinals are the second best event in the entire competition. With evenly matched opponents, there should be dramatic matches. If there are no surprises, the finalists will likely be Riggs and Henkel.</p>
<h3>Few Surprises in Women's Singles</h3>
<p>In the Women's Singles, the seeded players achieved complete victory, and the British players suffered the same fate as Austin. The results of the matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabyan (USA) defeated Mrs. Lycett (England) 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.  Miss Jędrzejowska (Poland) defeated Miss Scriven (England) 6-1, 6-3.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mathieu (France) defeated Miss St. Quintin (England) 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.</p>
<p>Miss Jacobs (USA) defeated Miss Lumb (England) 6-2, 7-5.</p>
<p>Miss Hardwick (England) defeated Miss McFerran (England) 6-4, 8-6.</p>
<p>Miss Stammers (England) defeated Mrs. Henrotin (France) 7-5, 6-2.</p>
<p>Miss Marble (USA) defeated Mrs. Halff (France) 6-1, 6-1.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sperling (Denmark) defeated Mrs. Sandison (England) 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>All Eight Remaining Women are Seeded Players</p>
<p>The eight women players, as expected, entered the "Final Eight." In the semifinals, the four matchups are: Miss Jacobs vs. Miss Stammers, Mrs. Mathieu vs. Mrs. Fabyan, Miss Hardwick vs. Mrs. Sperling, and Miss Jędrzejowska vs. Miss Marble.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

To ensure that the directors of each department understood the funding measures in the future, the association officially circulated a letter to each director yesterday.

<p>The Guanyun Small Football Team, possessing skilled football players such as Liu Tianshen, Qian Chifen, Luo Yongju, Liang Bowen, etc., has formidable strength. Yesterday, they played a friendly match against the A.Q. team at the Mong Kok Stadium. The A.Q. team consists of elite Shanghai players, and their football skills are not weak. The referee was Lei Shaoming. After the two teams started competing in Mong Kok, they competed fiercely. In the end, Guanyun won with a score of 2-1. It is also heard that the A.Q. team recently opened their own stadium on a wasteland on To Kwa Wan Road. The team, demonstrating the spirit of never fearing defeat, is eager for strong teams from the south to arrange matches. The contact address is Hong Kong Factory, Chung Hwa Book Company, Kowloon.</p>
<p>The Dequan Cup, organized by the Hong Kong Branch of the China National Small Football Association (i.e., the Hong Kong Small Football Advancement Association), has a total of 46 participating teams this year. The draw for allocating teams to each group was held a few days ago, dividing them into four groups: Luo, De, Quan, and Ding. The competition date has been set to begin at 3:00 PM on the 9th of this month.</p>
<h3>Southern Tour Diary</h3>
<p>— Chen Dehui</p>
<p>October 6th</p>
<p>According to the competition schedule, our team should be playing against the Southern Guangdong Second Team today. It is said that the Saigon Football Association held a meeting last night to discuss and determine a new formation, which shows its seriousness. In order to cope with strong opponents, our team has also carefully considered the selection of players. After the Southern Guangdong Second Team, we still have to face the most elite Southern Guangdong First Team in Saigon. The player selection for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai, Song Lingsheng, Yang Shuiyi, Li Zhaorong, Chen Deji (down), Yang Genbao (up), Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>After lunch, we had a full rest. When the time for the match arrived, we put on our uniforms and set off. Before departing, Mr. Liu Zeng and Zhu Zhonghao visited and talked about the opponent's strategy. According to them, the opposing team plans to use the Corinthian style of play, with two full-backs guarding the opponent's two wings, the half-backs guarding the opponent's two inside forwards, and the centre half-back acting as the third line of defense. This strategy will make it difficult for the opponent to advance, and victory will not be easy. Upon arriving at the stadium, the crowds had already gathered, almost blocking all paths. Although tickets had already sold out, there were still many people hoping to get in. At 4:30 PM, the witness gathered the captains of both teams for a formal exchange. Our Captain Bao even presented the other team with a team flag as a memento. After the ceremony, the competition began. Our centre forward Comrade Genbao played very hard, but he was nervous and his passing was often inaccurate. Moreover, the opponent's morale was high, and the first half ended in a 0-0 draw. In the second half, I received the team manager's order to replace Genbao. Although I felt tired playing, Jingxiang and Zhaorong were very active. Unfortunately, the opponent was overly aggressive, which detracted from the purpose of friendly exchange. I, Jingxiang, and Zhaorong were injured one after another, and Comrades Feng and Li suffered even more injuries. Although we finally won 3-2, the strength for tomorrow's battle was greatly reduced. The key contributors to this match were Jingxiang, who scored two goals, and Zhaorong, who added the finishing touch with one goal, totaling three goals.</p>
<p>After returning to the base camp, we immediately called for a doctor to treat the injured. Comrade Zhaorong had injured his foot in Hong Kong before, and it had not healed. Now, he was injured again. Even if he could play tomorrow, he would definitely not be at his best. Due to the fierce battle during the day, the soldiers were all exhausted and went to sleep early that night.</p>
<p>June 11th</p>
<p>This morning, Comrade Zhaorong felt severe pain in his foot, and his mobility was greatly reduced. Team Manager Mo, Zhou Qian, and others discussed the formation for today, all with furrowed brows. It is true that our team does not have many soldiers, and those with rich experience are seriously injured. In this condition of injury and disability, it is impossible to win against a strong enemy. We knew this early on. However, in order to preserve a city, we will not be discouraged. The lineup for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Yang Shuiyi, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Today's crowd was unprecedented. Nearly 6,000 people could not get in. After 4:00 PM, there was heavy rain. We fought in the rain because the schedule was fixed. The opponent was strong and vigorous, and they indeed used the Corinthian style, with the centre half-back acting as the third line of defense. Their attack and defense were well-organized, and they had made significant progress compared to the past. On the other hand, our three inside forwards were injured, and the ground was slippery due to the rain, so defeat was inevitable. The score of 5-3 should not be considered our fault.</p>
<p>After the match, the Saigon Football Association invited us to a tea party, and we dispersed joyfully late at night.</p>
