<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本火藥庫爆炸的觀察</h3>
<p>昨日各家通訊社盛傳大阪的×方火藥庫爆炸的消息，其慘情之大可說是空前的：「庫內容有若干人遇害尚無法統計，但庫四周的死傷已超過一百人」（中央社電），「災區兩處幾成平地，居民數千人皆無家可歸」（海通社）。這樁事件當然不是尋常事，我們應該加以深刻認識的，約有下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）火藥庫爆炸事件，應視爲日本人民拜日本侵略者所賜的慘禍。日本侵略者爲侵略外國而製造軍火，不獨加害一般人民以和平工業之衰退及財政上的負担，並且在這種塲合恩賜火藥庫內的工人及四周居民以難於形容的慘禍。我們對於日本人民所受這種災禍的慘痛，當然十分表示哀悼，但另一方面，我們不能不提醒日本人民猛省：災禍所以降臨的根本原因在於侵畧戰爭。倘若日本軍閥不爲燬壞人類的戰爭而製造軍火，倘若日本軍閥不爲侵略戰爭而趕快製造軍火，蓄積軍火，那末，日本根本就不會有這樣危險事因，同時也就不會發生這樣慘烈的災禍。日本人民不但要爲侵略戰爭而死亡於中國戰塲，流落於外國，並且還要被國內各種重負所壓迫，被火藥庫爆炸一類的災禍所光顧。侵略戰爭不停止，相信這類慘禍是無法避免的，還是要不斷發生的。</p>
<p>（二）對於這樁事件更應深刻追究的，是事件發生的原因，灾禍發生業已兩天，各通訊社的電訊，皆未提到原因。日本政府的公告雖說「災區內秩序如恒，居民亦極鎮靜」，但是實情如何，無從知悉，當然日本政府也不看照實公佈。不過，我們應當知道各國軍火的收藏當甚嚴密謹慎，日本的消防組織也甚周密，當然不至於容易焚燒，而昨日的災害竟然爆發，並且延燒至昨夜尚未停熄，所波及範圍至一英方里之廣，其發生的原因值得追究。我們還記淸楚：日本發動侵華戰爭不久，日本丸新兵工塲卽爲工人所爆炸，大阪許多乒工廠也常以工人的怠工聞。東京重工業區的川崎及千住的被徵新兵譁變的消息，也因日本革命者的傳達而爲一般人所知悉（鹿地亘先生在武漢的講演），台灣某兵工廠之爲共產黨所燒燬的消息，也從報上知其詳情。總之，日本的工人是在動了，特別是兵工廠的工人，正如鹿地亘先生之言，「手握住日本帝國主義的命脉」了。去年秋田縣的礦工曾經一度領導當地農民共同暴動過（據鹿地亘先生在武漢十二文化團體歡迎會上的報吿），現在日本的農民已因境遇之日劣而漸與工人聯結起來鬥爭了。我們對於這次日本工農暴動最初形態的焚燬爆炸事件，不能不加深刻注意。</p>
<p>（三）與火藥庫的爆炸相關聯而立卽想到的事件是：日本市區家屋之容易焚燬，及市區各種設備如電線及瓦斯管之能助長火燒。日本的家屋絕大多數是木板及稻草搭成的，電線及瓦斯管，在日本市區是「露天」的建設，所以一旦遇到火災，則有助長延燒的作用。這次因一火藥庫之起火而災區之廣大竟達一英方里之廣，民房被毀九百多所，不是沒有原因的。這裏，我們還可以聯想到日本各都市將來遭遇到蘇聯重轟炸時將發、生如何慘烈災情的可能性。日本的精華集中在阪神，京濱，及福岡三個主要市區，大阪燒燬之如此容易，我們不難想到日本全國人民之覆沒又是摧枯拉朽的工作而己。日本人民應醒覺：「要阻止這種慘烈命運之到來，只有設法停止浸略戰爭」。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從二月廿五日至三月二日</p>
<p>橫跨着二三兩月的這一星期，正像變化無窮的春天的天氣，國際上　事情也有較重大的變化。特別值得注意的是英法兩國政府的宣佈承認西班牙叛軍及其偽政權，和美國關島設防案的遭遇否决。這些變化，自然要影響到遠東時局，於是表現出日本侵華軍事的突轉激劇，和英日談判的情勢緊張。所有這些事情的演燮，具有佝種意義，而且將有何種新的發展呢？我們就在這裏提出一個簡略的報告：</p>
<p>英法承認西叛</p>
<p>法外長龐萊於二月廿六日宣佈法政府承認西叛軍佛朗哥政權，英政府亦於二月　日正式宣佈承認佛朗哥政權。英法統治者此舉，可算是兩年又八个月以來所謂『對西戰不干涉政策』的最高度的表現，爲了他們　數金融資本家領袖的利益，他們自以爲是識時的俊傑，籍此可以與意德兩國同時取得在西班牙角逐與開發的權利，甚至幻想籍此改變意德侵略冒險的路綫，組織歐洲的反蘇陣綫。然而英法統治者此舉顯將獲得相反的結果。誠如三月二日蘇聯真理報所稱：『英法承認法朋哥政權，是法西斯進攻英美法民主國重新風分世界之二次世界大戰發展的新　段，是英法向法西斯退讓的第二次慕尼黑協定。』最近事實表現的是（一）佛朗哥對英法承認表示冷淡，這顯然是他的主千意德當局的態度；（二）意德兩國對此毫無表示，他們正在計劃着：怎樣在英法此種繼續示弱的有利情勢之下，進行新的冒險，三月一日倫敦各報柏林探訪。就巳傳出希特勒和墨索里尼將再度會晤的消息。（三）意德侵略的冒險行勵愈加劇烈，如巴力斯坦談話的失敗，如南愛反英運動的蔓延，如墨西哥叛亂事件的突發等等都是。（四）日本在遠東採取更橫蠻的攻勢，向英法恣意威脅助素。（五）英國內部反對運動在共產黨及工黨領導之下急劇發展。（六）法國人民反政府怒潮同時高漲。（七）西班牙總統阿柴那辭職，三月二日選由巴利奧繼任，外畏　育宜示，西班牙共和政府不問環境如何惡劣，决爲人民自由與共和而奮鬥到底。這些事實証明：（一）西戰并未結束，（二）英法妥協政榮失敗，（三）國際形勢愈趨嚴重。</p>
<p>英否認關島增防</p>
<p>英法統治者對於法西期妥協政策變本加厲的演出，使世界戰爭危機更趨嚴重、同時亦使革命的情緒與力量更加提高。但又有美衆院否决關島增防案的事件，引起各方的悲觀失望。關島增防計劃目的在對付日本在太洋委任硫治地上的海軍建設，同時對於英國保衛其遠東利益及中國的抗戰，都有重大的協助的意義。關島增防案的否决，一面表現出美國對於日本在遠東冒險行爲的很　態度，一面表示了美國對英法中國合作誠意的不足。美國政府中反動份子此舉顯爲對羅斯福政策的進攻，而在國際上造成陰暗的局面。然而這究竟只是美國少數反動份子的陰謀表現，此案否决以後，不僅全美人民劇烈反對，美國海陸軍事當局更一致表示不滿。據三月一日華盛頓電，美參院已採取於下星期一重提關島設防問題的步驟；而五萬萬元軍事建築案內，六百萬元建築夏威夷及運河區防務，四百廿八萬五千元建築及鞏固夏威夷菲律賓沿海防務案。則爲已成事實。美國海軍大演習，亦在羅斯福總統指揮下繼續熱烈舉行，英法兩國當局並已允予合作，借供各地屬島。由此可見美國援助民主和平各國的政策，正在強固的實力支持之下，决不會有重大變更。</p>
<p>蘇聯增防海參威</p>
<p>和美國　軍大演習『相映成趣』的是蘇聯方面於二月廿八日宣佈建設強大海軍計劃。這個計劃似括蘇聯在歐亞兩洲，繼建設世界上最強大的空軍之後，建設世界最強大的海軍，其目的是便社會主義祖國的海軍力望，可能在敵人的領海內，消滅敵人的海軍。據蘇聯紅軍第一軍政治部主任那第興氏的報吿，這一計劃，不久就可實現，因爲蘇聯現有工人及工廠，都有能力迅速製造軍艦太砲，及其他新銳武器。去年已經製造成許多戰艦及潛艇，最近因鑑於日本在遠東冒險行動的更趨猖狂，蘇日漁約糾紛及蘇鮮偽滿邊境日偽軍之不斷挑寡，已於陸續增強遠東睦空軍防衛之外，特派最新戰　多艘加入紅軍遠東艦隊，增防海參威一帶。上月廿三日蘇聯紅軍廿一週年紀念日，紅軍與共領導者斯丹林監决的宣誓後，眞理報曾明白宣示「紅軍爲全世界和平的堡壘，旣不恐嚇人，亦不受人恐嚇，全世界無產階級的同情，都是紅軍有力的後盾，而紅軍供献其畢生於社會主義祖國與世界勞働大衆及被壓迫民族的精神，更可爲全世界求自由與和平者的忠實友軍」。特別德得注意的是蘇聯海軍的發展，尤其是蘇聯遠東艦隊的發展，對於英美法海軍合作，將發生重大的推動作用，日本海相米內最近宣佈不久大量造艦以與英美蘇抗衡，可見蘇聯新海軍之被重視及其與英美利　之一致。當此日本侵略者肆意威脅英法之際，蘇聯海軍之發展，　有更重大的意義，英法美當局亦不得不加以擁護了。最近英政府决派商務特使赴莫斯科，及三月一日晚張伯倫破例赴蘇使館宴會，經路透社指爲「此或英政府對蘇關係重新考慮之暗示」常非架空之詞。（詳評請閱今日第四版小評。）</p>
<p>日本新冒險計劃</p>
<p>最近的時局，給日本侵略者以發動『太平洋九一八』的機會：第一是英法妥協政策變本加厲的演出，授日×在遠東冒險以可乘少隙；第二是意德侵略勢力已在歐洲分向美洲亞洲伸展，牽制英美法各民主和平國家注意，使日×更加放胆地在遠東實行新的冒險：第三是以蘇聯爲基幹的民主和平陣綫運助已在法西斯侵峪者進一步壓迫及偽善懦弱屈服的政策下面，開始統一起來鞏固起來發展起釆，日×更謀在和平陣綫尚未完成其統一笨固與發展以前，推進其新的冒險；第四是中國抗戰新生力量日益發展，日本侵華軍事瀕於被迫停頓狀態，他們自然要用新的冒險來打破這一局面；第五是日本國內反戰運動在重重警備與壓迫下抬頭起來（二月廿八日至三月二日的大阪附近軍火庫爆炸事件，計燬座九百間，無家可歸者八千三百三十三人，軍火座損失達五千萬元以上，一年內亦難修葺供用。即爲一例）日本侵華軍隊內部反戰怠戰譁變運動，近來愈形發展。日必數起。日×便謀以新的冒險來緩和這種形勢的發展。所謂新的胃險計劃，其一是以強佔海南島轟炸香港邊境及爭奪上海祖界等嚴重事件，向英法各國肆行威脅勒索；第一步停止援華步驟，第二步調停中國抗戰；第三步就是置英法在遠東權益於日本領導的『東亞新秩序』之下。其二是開始採取各路侵華部隊的急攻，以牽制我正面各軍之轉取攻勢，同時加緊強佔地區統治勢力的鞏固，交通運輸路線的維持及偽軍的新編訓練，準備最後的進攻。</p>
<p>抗日戰爭一週間</p>
<p>日本侵略者新的冒險計劃在過去一星期內已有值得注目的表現。第一，威脅英法的三步驟。海南島事件，英法對策是：（一）兩國當局重申英法密切合作，並講求對美合作（三）分別宜示英法政府决不承認任何旣成事實，遵重九國公的維護中國領土主權完整，堅持援助中國的國聯决議案。因此日本在海南島登陸一舉，尚無重大成就。其次矗炸香港新界羅湖事件，英政府採取嚴正張硬態度，日方接受道歉賠償，因此亦可算是失敗了。至於上海租界事件，經過兩個星期狂風暴爾，現已稍趨沉靜。但是日本和英法對峙形勢未改，日本冒險行動隨時都會發動，這是有望於我各友邦之善於應付，因爲祗有切實打擊侵略者的步驟，才能消除一切威脅嚇詐的進襲。第二，關於中日戰局，最近一星期除西北戰區沒有特別重要戰事以外，華南方面，日×自佔海南島後，不斷威脅北海等地，造成進攻南路威脅桂滇的步驟，但因英法態度尚不如在歐洲的表示繼續屈服，法國不能不增加遠東軍備（以不爲意國所乘爲限），英國亦積極強化遠東防務（如錫蘭島飛機塲動工，阿丁堡壘實力增厚等），同時我西南國防力量日益雄厚，廣東方面隨時準備攻勢，使×無由獲逞。祗有沉寂已久的華中戰況，本週突又緊張，長江以北之×，分沿漢水及川漢路線西犯，佔奪天門京山，一部且越過漢江，道迫荊門，造成西窺宜昌入川，北圖襄陽犯陝形勢。長江以南，則連日遷兵調將，積極佈置進犯南昌長沙的軍事。一面又以海南擾犯浙江沿海，以陸軍分別進攻游擊區，據最近×軍內外情勢而觀，×人尚無分窺川陝之計，亦無打通粵漢全線之力，所以突取冒險的攻勢，顯在企圖牽制我各綫正面之攻勢準備，以便其加緊粛淸佔領區內的反抗力量，鞏固與加強其統治力量，同時並藉此新的冒險以振作日趨疲敝的軍心和制止愈演愈烈的偽軍反正日軍反戰行動。如果這個估計不至大錯，則預料西北戰區可無重大變化，而粵漢沿綫，浙贛各地及各淪陷地區，將爲重要作戰地區，全部戰局，可望繼續穩定。我們的任務，就在趕快以較大兵團挺進游擊區，協助搗亂×軍後路，極力削弱×軍的進攻力量，發動×軍的大舉叛　，爭取更多的時間來準備反攻的力量。至於日×漢奸「反共，和平，親日」的陰謀，則仍不可忽靦，本報昨日社評言之甚詳，這裏不再重複。</p>
<h3>重慶的「姑姑園」</h3>
<p>— 知我</p>
<p>「廚子老太爺」的史實</p>
<p>『到了重慶而不吃『姑姑園』，是不懂得領略眞正的「川菜」味道，也可說枉住在重慶一囘』。道句話是居住重慶而被稱爲「下江人」通常的「口頭禪」。同時也是一般公認的定語。</p>
<p>不過一個月前，「姑姑園」已竟倒閉，一些「老婆」們再無機會快其朵頤了。倒閉的原因，　由於『姑姑圍』的『廚子老太爺』患心臟麻痺症暴薨，拋下「廚子老太爺」的姨太太，少老爺無力經營，遂不得已而歇業，重慶一個月以來餐館業爲之無光，「川菜」食譜中爲之黯淡，這眞是重慶風光裏一種重大的損失，值得老　們扼腕太息的。</p>
<p>講起「姑姑園」的「廚子老太爺」，來頭很大，他原是四川成都籍貫，姓名是「黃晉臨」，今年如果仍然活着，則是六十二歲的中壽人了。據說他是世家的子弟，先人曾充過前淸四五品以上的京官，他本人也曾蔭襲過功名，前淸末葉作過一任知縣。自己因爲好吃，平時專在燒割烹煮上用功夫，獨出匠心，創製幾種菜來，自久成爲習慣，不單成爲習慣，且成癖嗜，有空閒時即燒煮菜餚爲自娛之事。家中男女老幼，受他的薰陶，久而久之，也都具了這種癖好，當他住在成都原籍時候，一所住宅，非常閎敞，蒔花種竹，推些山石，頗有幽邃之雅。他又好附會風雅，交接文人騷客，字實書帖，屏聯軸幅，曆掛滿堂，點綴他那住宅，極端的淨潔，他自己也能寫一筆很好的字，什麼黃石谷，王右軍，東南宮，劉石菴，眞楷，革棣，　樣都可來兩軍，於是爲一些無聊的「斗方、名士」所噓捧，居然聲價甚高。往年四川軍閥割據，握兵符的宴筵無虛日，因爲「廚子老太爺」庭院清幽，每多借齋歡聚之舉，「廚子老太爺」，雖無巴結顯要的意思，但有時也自吿奮勇；毛遂自薦，玩一兩囘『票』，親爲烹調菜餚，時日旣久，輾轉傳出，眞個賓至如歸，借齋設筵，「廚子老太爺」一顯絕技的事，幾無日無之，「廚子老太爺」漸成爲私家的高等廚師慢慢走入職業化一途。有人借齋筵客，「廚子老太爺」不素費用，但祗要蔬菜的材料費，最低是四五十元一席，多則益善。楊永泰居成都時，稱得起「廚子老太爺」最知己的吃客，楊不吃『老太爺』的燒菜不歡，「老太爺」的菜，不經楊品辨，也認爲他人是「猪八戒吃人參某。食而不知其味。」</p>
<p>楊永泰後來坐擁　比於湖北，函邀「廚子老太爺」前往，不幸的很，老太爺來到軍慶，還沒搭船，楊氏忽然遇狙擊而死。老太爺携眷在途，覺得就那樣囘成都，臉上朱免無光，所以爽性就居下，賃住在重慶楊柳街至誠巷一號，門楣上掛一方遍，是：『姑姑園』三字。這裏雖不如成都舊居的宏敞軒　，但小院一所，種些花草，修理得也還淸靜。凡是成都來的軍政要人，照舊到老太爺這裏招呼一下，老太爺照例時現「易牙之技」，索要材料費，而爲烹　肴，饌。三數年來，老太爺的「姑姑園一名馳遐邇，幾乎四川的人無人不曉得的。吃客旣多，捧塲的人也自多，而且所來『吃』的人，恰是從來「盡達官無白丁」，老太爺在此種人游揚下，聲價愈來愈高，老太爺日不暇給，對於吃客潮有了選剔之權，能得老太爺一諾，而承應爲你作廚的機會也愈少。</p>

<p>【本報特稿】我在中國的三個月里、中國朋友們問我的第一個問題是：『法國的遠東外交政策怎樣？』他們尤其更急切地訊問着法國對于中國的眞正態度、當然、這决不是個普通隨隨便便的發問、而是帶着特別的心情、充滿了希望、友誼與熱忱的表露、同時、中國人對于法國外交態度的特別注意、也决不單純地、因爲法國的安南與中國、在地理上有着密切以聯繫、而是因爲法國至今依然是自由、獨立主義的祖國、國際公理民主制度的保姆、雖然法國到現在爲止、還沒有給中國以很大的幫助、可是中國人民對于法國的這種天眞堅决的信任、始終很深刻地存留在腦海里、因此、站在『中國之友』的立塲下、以一個還有願為自由、獨立而奮鬥光榮傳統的法國人的資格、該有向正在鬥爭途徑中的朋友們、說明一下法國遠東政策的必要、講到法國的外交政策、當然是脫離不開近年來的整個國際局勢的、從一九三三年希特勒爬上德國政治舞台之後、歐洲便進步了她的不幸的境遇、並且這種不幸的成份、還是隨時而增加的、建立日耳曼帝國的對心、給了德國附近的許多國家以不斷的威脅、尤其是與德國接壤的法國、和中歐那些與法國有良好友誼小國、德意軸心成立後、法西斯的勢力、　外蓬勃、歐洲的危機、亦因之加深、歐洲民主國家對于法西斯勢力的第一個反應、是在一九三四年想與侵略者訂立妥協的四強協定、由于法西斯國家的野心太大、要求過高、所謂「四強協定」、終歸流產、舉例來說、德國要求在中歐自由活動、意大利要在地中海與北非洲有特別的勢力範圍、這種種的事實、是說明法國是正忙于應付中歐和北非的糾紛、薩爾事件、日耳曼糾紛、阿比西尼亞的滅亡、奧地利的被吞噬、以及捷克斯拉夫的遭犧牲、這一大串血腥約歷蹟、莫不示意着法　在歐洲的無能爲力、</p>
<p>當中日戰爭開始後、歐洲的危機、亦空前地增加、法西斯進攻西班牙的勢頭、亦格外兇猛了、捷克斯拉夫、也在這時期遭受到禍害、所以、我們可以注意到中日戰爭的發展、是和歐洲的危機、同時並進和同時增加的、在一九三八年年底、法國須要集中一切的注意力子德國、意大利、與西班牙交界地帶的安問題、這些事實、說明了法國無力顧問遠東的理由、同時、法國雖然明白中日戰爭中的罪魁日本帝國主義、是德意法西斯的同盟者、而中日戰爭的延長、適足以增加對于安南安全的威脅、然而法蘭西在歐洲、旣然都有點自顧不暇、故對于卽使是迫到眉睫的安南國防問題、亦皆無法司顧問了、這是事實、安南政府深切地了解南安與中國在遠東、有着共同的利害關係、安南政已與人民一致地了解、如果日本眞正戰勝中國的話、那未安南的命運、也就十分危急了、這是爲什麽安南人同情中國抗戰想恢復了『中國叔叔』（Chfnese　Uncle）稱呼的理由、另外還有件值得一提的事體、直到一九三八年的年底、安南才得到一點法國的幫功以增強國防、以上所有的理由吿訴我們、爲什麼法國到現在還不能幫中國更多一點我忙、</p>
<p>除了前面所提到種種事　上的理由之外、此地還須敘述一些政治上的緣故、從法國人民陣綫消解之後、法國的法西斯力量、逐漸強大、我們知道、在每一個國家裏的法西斯組織以及許多同情、法西期的保守的黨派、都是傾向日本的、日本人也就利用法國法西斯的協助建立了嚴密的宣傳機關、以麻醉法國的與論、還有法國的政界人物、頗之以前中國政府某個甚有名望的政治家（指汪精衛——編者）的影響、他說：『中國是弱國、是缺乏科學化和機械化的現代兵器的國家、自然沒有可能抵抗到底、中國最好的出路、無過於和日本講和。…』這種失敗主義的論調、引起法國政界一種很不好的反應、他們以爲：『如果中國自己都沒有戰勝日本的自信、那未法國幫助中國、除了徒然引起日本的仇視以外、尤有什麽意思呢？』加以國際情勢、就這樣惡劣、法國可以助人的力量、亦甚有限、若祗徒勞而無功、倒不如樂得『兩面討好』了、自注精衛被開除黨籍後、法國政界的態度當有很大的好轉、</p>
<p>在事實上、法國大部份輿論、始終還是同情中國的、詳細一點說、所有前進的左翼的政黨、和大多數的民衆團體、都是完全贊助中國的、當然、如果這種出於正義的羣衆的熱情、能以更多的中國英勇抗戰的事蹟、不斷地向他們報吿的話、我相信這種同情心是會無限地　廣和加強的、</p>
<p>另外有一件事情、也是我們須知道的、日本是世界上最有走私技術的國家、現在他們已把各種走私的技巧、應用到宣傳工作上來了、一方面他宣傳着中國是怎樣地野蠻、他方面則鼓吹日本是怎樣在為中日的友善及遠東和平而戰、但是、我們非常瞭解、這種解釋、不過是自欺欺人的把戲、而無絲毫事實的根據、法國每個人都知道日本人的宣傳工作、不過是想掩飾其在中國屠殺平民和轟炸不設防城市的罪惡、同時、也知道日本人口中的所謂「友善」、也祗只許日本是中國的『唯一之友』而已、換句話　、『遠東是遠東人的遠東、而日本則是　東的唯一主人』、可是中國却並不需要像日本這樣的宣傳、她取好的宣傳工具、就是十八個月以來的抗戰事實、這决不是誇張的說法、中國的長期抗戰、巳在國際上取得極好的外交優勢了、全世界大多數人、對中國同情的輿論，將會推動所有的民主國家　中國以更人的協助、法國的達東政策及其外交態度、自然也會漸趨積極、而傾向中國方面來的、</p>
<p>法國政府現在不得不了解日本的力量、是不足以征服中國的、中日戰爭的發展、祗是增加日本人在遠對東于外人利益的損害、在經濟上講、日本巳開始侵略安南了、法國想與日本保持友善、無異是　夢想、以往日本人對于華北的所謂『經濟提携』、現在已開始在安南進行了、而安南政府、幾次想淸除境內的日本間諜、這也是事　、國政府本來以爲與日本保持友好、是保障安南最好的辦法、但是、事實的表現已無情地粉　了法國的夢想、當捷　事件非常惡化、全世界人十、都等待着第二次世界爆發的炮火的時候、幾只日本戰艦、已開始游弋於圍洲島與巴拉西爾島（Paracelo　Island）之問、將要接近安南的海防綫了、如果歐洲的戰號一鄉、我相信日本卽劾要在安南登陸、現在日本儼然進攻海南島、這事實當使法國政府覺吾、要保障安南和維護九國公約的唯辦法。實在只有幫助中國抗戰、打倒共同的×人——×××××。（救亡社特約）</p>

<h3>孔祥熙在參政會報告開發西部富源續　—三月政治報告之五—</h3>
<p>經濟設施方面</p>
<p>關於經濟方面的工作、仍本開發資源增進生產的旣定方針繼續推進、其經過情形、主管部另有詳細的報吿、茲僅就有關政府大政方針的幾點，略加說明：</p>
<p>第一、我國已往工業的發展、未能按照計劃進行、旣不顧及國防軍事的需要、又不注意各區域的天然資源、這實在是建設過程中的一種浪費、故自抗戰以來、政府就竭力避免道種缺憾、現在經濟部已將沿海沿江各大都市的工廠、遷移到內地開工、同時創設新的工業、以後的發展、絕不能再聽其自然、要按照計劃進行、政府斟酌西南各省的資源及交通、决定以四川的沱江及岷江區域爲第一期要發展的工業區域、在這區域內、有爲縣的煤礦、及戚還縣的煤油和煤氣、據專家研究、都是很有希望的、現在該區域內已經設有酒精廠、發電廠、化學工廠、正在計劃中的有造紙廠和製　廠、區域經濟的計劃、在我國是件創舉的事、現幸這事旣有專家主持、其成功是可期待的、</p>
<p>第二、國營事業和私營事業的配合、也是件極重要而且極複雜的問題同在民生主義之下、我們當然設法節制資本、預防少數資本家壟斷市塲、把持金融、自法幣政策施行及政府銀行健全化以來、私人把持金融的關慮、可以說沒有了、主要的交通工具、早已收歸國有、大的礦區、尤其是有關國防工業及重工業的　區、也已經劃爲國營礦區、私人壟斷市　的顧慮、也減少了許多、在我們這個工業不發達的國家、國營事業和私營事業的範圍都是很大的、但是倘若範圍不劃淸或是政府朝令夕改、私人資本必不敢勇往直前、故政府近來對於公司法的修改、私人企業的獎勵、官商的合作等問題、均特別注意、</p>
<p>（未完）</p>

<h3>×機替常德人打氣</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　賡雅</p>
<p>常德城　沅水左岸，形勢頗與湘潭相似；不過稍有不同者，湘潭在湘水對岸，沒有居民，常德在沅水的對岸，還有一部份民房罷了。</p>
<p>常德是湘西著名的一個商埠，凡從沅水流域，湘黔公路（京滇公路之一段）運來的物產，都要薈萃在它這裏，另行裝運輪船從洞庭駛往長沙，岳陽，漢口等地。雖則俟湘黔鐵路染成通車後，他在商業上的繁榮地位，也許要被和她爭籠的姊妹　——　潭奪去大部份，但她在國防上屏蔽川黔的重要性，并不因之稍有減色。</p>
<p>城中有兩條大街，用石板鋪成寬平的路面，烘托着兩旁中西合璧的商店建築，倒充分顯示着靠近大山城市所特具的剛勁風格。全縣人口，多至一百二三十萬，也是湖南人口最多的四大縣之一。不過城中人口，據縣府秘書朱懋祺君談，舊時僅有三萬人，抗戰後便「食指日繁」直至武漢撤退時，會一度激增至八九萬人，後因×機三參九拜地常來恭謁，於是又積極疏散到有二萬人了</p>
<p>×機之來肆虐，先到城外轟炸三次，城內四次。所投炸彈，漫無標點，誠如兒童故事中所傳戇女婿在大河水泡裏煮鷄蛋，投一個沉一個，連回響都沒一聲。這并非形容過甚的話，事實上它們在縣政府（可笑×機每到一內地就只會恭謁縣政府送禮）及他處所投的許多未炸彈，不是依然還保一羣羣活寶貝似的××俘虜們，在那里陳列着任人卿賞麼？</p>
<p>然而，×機不惜以日本人民血肉提煉製造成的炸彈，十次百次的老向一個地万來自行消耗，所謂百發一中，不幸最近常德却遭了它一次毒手了！道次因警報發後時間太長，市民　認×機不來「光顧」，便從防空壕以及近郊相率返家。誰料狡獪兇殘的×機，忽目霎霄猛可降下，向民房大肆轟炸，并用機槍掃射奔逃人羣。一時血肉橫飛，哭聲震野，死傷無辜平民，多至六百多人。尤其粉陳某處之血肉死屍，斑斑塊塊，其密度據與上海八一三抗戰時，×機偷炸南京路三大公司慘狀相彷彿！</p>
<p>縣屬　姆鎮有居民五百餘戶，被投燒夷彈數十，燒去房屋五分之三，但居民無死傷者，可謂不幸中之幸！</p>
<p>朱秘醫還說：中國長期抗戰，有個非他國所能企及的特殊條件，就是炸不盡的抗戰土地，炸不完的抗戰人民。以常德來說，每次慘炸之後，只要政府稍予救濟，即可恢復原狀。這里有很多老百姓，以前從未經歷這麼長久和大規模的戰事，他們往往五相走間：此次支持十幾個月的抗戰。人民所出的一切力量，大概已算得「仁至義盡」了吧？換句話說，就是應該「賣刀買牛」，準備過太平年了！有時縣府出布吿徵寡人力，會被視爲其文，靑年學生演新劇激勵献金，會被當作把戲白看。可是平空無故的每遭×機轟炸一次，他們熱血　會沸騰起來一度，無論輪財衛國；應徵作工，捐物勞慰傷兵，他們邸會一倡百和，踴躍參加了。×人一日不趕出我們的國境，我們絕不能得到一日之安寧，這層有深切連鎖關係的意義，他們居然也由血的教訓中體驗明白了。×人妄以轟炸來威脅我們後方，結果　轟炸反愈增進我們的敵愾心，蓋不僅徒勞無功也，</p>
<p>尤有進者，湘西地勢險峻，洞庭港沒交錯，人民抗戰情緒高漲，自衛團隊組織堅強，盤踞湘北的×寇，以目前僅有的兵力，若企圖沿洞庭西犯，顯然是死路一條。但『××肚裏　　多」，他們自己倒也有數。所以他們在岳陽縮住脚頭，不敢擅越雷池一步，歷時至三月有餘，原因卽在于此。可是最近我游擊隊已發動猛攻岳陽城　的戰鬥，并與正規軍取得機勸的聯絡，不時進迫岳陽東部西塘麻塘桃林等處，以坿其背而擣其首，并設法割斷其後方交通。我們可以退一步說，今後的短期間，×人縱然仍得在湘北固守一隅，但是終不能成爲威脅湘西的怪物了。故目前湘西問題，不專在×人之威脅，而在內部之有癱患，容於下篇通訊中述之。</p>

<h3>旗艦上之會議</h3>

<p>此一消息必爲各方所注目。吾人所能說而且必須說明者，第一，認淸此項會議係在何　環境中舉行乎？非正在日×強佔海南島之後乎？非正在日×轟炸港界羅湖之後乎？非正在日×發動奪取上海租界之後乎？吾人對於日×最近之　險行動迭予指出，吾人對於香港今日處境，亦迭有暗示，此次會議旣將討論及英日雙方關於香港及華南之衝突問題，則首先注意到日方是否能無條件地解除包圍香港之成脅？抑係祗限於若干封鎖之開放？或甚至於附帶若干條件？此爲吾人所不能漢不關心者！其次，吾人有望於友邦人士注意者一，今日香港及英國在華之地位，其利害實興中國政府及其人民完全一致，吾人深信英方决不承認住何與中國及中國人民利益違背之要求，吾人史渴盼友邦正義人士能以與論力量，對侵略者戚脅香港及華兩之事實，迅作堅強一致之抗饑。</p>
<h3>英蘇交驩</h3>
<p>路透社二日倫敦電稱，英首相張伯倫於一日晚應　聯大使邁斯基邀請，打破英國保守黨外交　酢前例，親赴蘇大使館宴會，此事業已引起各方之注意。</p>
<p>查前數日英政府曾决定派遺商務特使赴莫斯科，而英蘇新商約亦曾作商談準備，今日又有此舉，無怪路透社之明言『此或英政府對蘇聯翻係將重新考慮之暗示』矣。</p>
<p>吾人稍知蘇聯外交國策之旨在維持世界和平反對一切侵略，及其近來「民主和平各國聯台起來」之號召，對於英蘇接近，無待置疑。至於英國方面，吾人如桌以張伯倫此舉即視爲英國統治者卽將澈底放棄反蘇政策，在時間上未免過早，而張伯倫政府最近承認西叛軍政府一事，更與此種傾向大相背反。但吾人同時應知國際法西斯侵略者進一步威脅民主和平各國之事實，一方面激起英法及全世界勞動大衆對於妥　政策之反感，又一方面則增加各國人民對於蘇聯政府及和平陣綫之信仰，此種事實，英國統治者亦無由否認，且今日英國不論在歐洲及遠東，其國家利害，均與蘇聯一致，英國固欲保持其在歐洲及遠東之地位，均不能不有賴於蘇聯之協力支持。故吾人以為英國政府重新考慮對蘇關係，不僅爲今日所必需，亦已具備此種可能，吾人甚盼英蘇關係漸獲新的發展，民主和平陣線漸能強化，此不僅爲中華民族之期望，凡關心世界和平者，均應負起促進英蘇友誼之責任也。</p>
<h3>莫索里尼的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 董平譯</p>
<p>——德意軸心貌合神離的真象</p>
<p>此文摘譯目「多瑙河國家的命運」（Danubian　Destfng）一書，原著者Gramham　Hustton，爲「倫敦經濟」編輯。</p>
<p>普通人看起法西斯兩巨頭來、總常常把莫索里尼放在前頭、當他是老大哥、但事實却遠不是這樣、自從德、意軸心建立之後、莫索里尼實在巳完全淪為希特勒的附庸了、而被逼着跟希特勒亂闖了、別的不說、意國加入了德、意軸心之後、僅僅在一九三八年一年之內、她已丟　了奧大利、捷克及匈牙利的一切。望着一件件的滾向德國的懷抱中去、而有冤無處訴。現在她是在希望德國能以恩報德、助她　英法索一筆補　。可是德國能爲她幫忙到怎樣的程度實在是個疑問。意大利人對德國的反猶運動、實在老早就自點不樂意、他們眼見着目下許多突尼斯的猶太富商、都恨反猶的怒潮、逼着投進法國籍了、這目然是意大利財富的一大捐失、其實即令莫索里尼自己也不贊成希特勒的一味反猶、幾年前莫索里尼的財長還是猶太人、而他自己又是猶太書展的老顧客、不過、他明白他的力量是不够去勸他的小弟弟了。</p>
<p>德、意的暗鬥、我們可以很明顯地自去年十一月中、捷、匈的糾紛中看出、那時德國剛在捷克獲了無上勝利、匈牙利眼見之下、也學德國的樣向捷克索取盧森尼亞區域、這塊地方弁戰前原是匈牙利的、但戰後却成了捷克的一部、當時、匈牙利以意大利爲撑腰、向捷克劍拔穹張、大有非攫得不可的樣子、但却沒斜到、捷克受英、法出賣之　、竟乾脆順在德國的一邊了、所以、德國便抬出頭來干涉捷、匈糾紛、結果捷、匈實在變成了德、意的談話、那談話的結果、顯然的、莫索里尼又遭了一次失敗、續算里賓特羅甫還給齊亞諾留面子、答應呌捷克　了　森尼亞的一部份還給匈牙利、令莫索里尼不太下不去、</p>
<p>在這事件結束之後、匈牙利的不自在、自然是跟意大利是一樣、但它尤感失望的、是她的傳統保護者意大利也無力相助了、她決不曾忘記、　終有一天、她能照樣的請德國吃次大虧、悅誠信服匈牙利的顏色、但在今日、她沒有辦法、只有反脫捨意大利、而去就德國的蔭庇，</p>
<p>匈牙利被制於德國、是可以自一伴很小的事上有出來、匈總理伊曼第博士、不久以前、他會對倫敦『每日電郵報』發表了一次談話、匈京的一家著名日報、把遭談話轉載了、結果被處分停刊二星期、這是因爲柏林提出抗議的原故、柏林抗議的理由、是因爲　曼第氏談話曾說、如果　克與德國發生戰爭、匈牙利得守中立、遠意思是說、希特勒不准匈牙利守中立、而要她跟着德國打仗、</p>
<p>跟上面這個故事完全相同的、還有西班牙的佛朗哥、他也是因爲發表了一次自立的談話、柏林和羅馬、馬上送來了警吿、請他反省自己、注意言行、不然、德意的志願軍準備撤退、讓叛軍去屢戰屢北、</p>
<p>上面說的是一些政治方面、現在可以約略看一看作者在經濟方面的觀察、</p>
<p>最顯然的、自奧大利被併、捷克被割之後、德國不論在政治、在經濟方面、部已執了中歐的午耳、此後、很可能的、大家都要承仰她的鼻息、</p>
<p>我們該記得、捷克是在大戰後建立的國家、她根本不會、而且不會在大戰負過戰債、但和會上却决定要她負責代奧大利償還百分之西十二、及代匈牙利償還百分之十六的戰　、這是很滑稽的、而時至今日、捷克的一大圈土地又被宰割了、而允以富庶的蘇台德區也已　離、那要她再來負責償這筆戰債、實在是太欠公允的、而且也不是它那貧瘠的力量所能及、目下能認爲最妥常的、自應當由德國與匈牙利去分別負責、因爲唯有它倆在慕尼黑會議中收獲最多、</p>
<p>在經濟方面、所應當提出的、還是意大利、到現在爲止、意大利不但在政治方面、卽在經濟方面、也十足成爲德國　附席了、它己自奧大利失去了大部份的商業交易、它國內的北部第一要鎮持里斯、也在一個險惡的境地中、那兒的人民、也許以不久後、也會成了德國的大好主顧、</p>
<p>還有瀕亞德里　境的意大利的許多口岸、像阜姆等地方、這一年來的航船顯然銳減、交易日稀，這些　是法西斯的官吏所頗爲焦慮的、莫索里尼也心不明白、希特勒的一味胡幹下去、對意大利是有損無益的、</p>
<p>最後、作者對歐洲的一般大局、也作了個詳盡的分析、而對於一切可能的將來、邵加以推測　研究、舉個例說吧、那該是一般人很少能遠見得到的、他認爲、德意將來一定會向美麗和平的瑞士進攻的、他暴露了目下納粹用的一切和平宣傳的方法、想在瑞士找到一個立足地、但因爲瑞士愛國情緒的高漲、納粹是失敗了、到現在還不能在國民選舉中、覓得半點地位、赫登氏并且斷定、卽令德意將來進一步的以武力進攻瑞士、仍然是不能成功的、</p>
<p>說到歐洲的將來、作者勸英國不必氣綏（又惜這話恐怕已經說遲了此——譯者）他以一切具備的理由來証明、如果德意軸心眞的掀起了戰爭、那也只是他的冒險行爲，在　胃險之中、德國是銀在一九一四年時一般、想得一個『速戰速勝』、但那是過去奢望了、如果民主國家能協力與之週旋成一個長期戰鬥，德意是必敗無　的、</p>
<p>希特勒的最大錯誤、便是他最近的如火如茶的反美遝動、把同文同種的英國和美國逼成携手嚇合了、德國反猶反美的結果、使一向自掃門前雪的美國民衆也義憤填胸起來，圾近一位美國駐歐洲的公使說、他在外交界混了幾十年、還是第一次見到美國人對外國真正的發怒、還有紐約的一家著名德文報紙、在德大使離美返德的時候、也慨然的承認、納粹的一切措施、是把德美兩國　固有的友誼完全毀滅了、</p>
<p>作者在書中的結論說、華盛頓是决定歐洲將來命運的一大支柱、如果縱以爲、歐洲的國家都是德國的俎上之肉、從今以後、都要是德國的支配、那實在是錯誤的、</p>

<h3>知識青年何處去？</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>生活書店招考四練習生，應考六百餘人</p>
<p>在資本主義社會之下，「知識」成爲賤價的商品了。知識靑年要擺脫時代的舌惱，原就不是一件易事，，自不免　要火上加油，愁上加愁呢。</p>
<p>生活書店幾天前登報招考四個練習生，有很多人怕還就不知道有這麽一回事；可是截　昨大止，報名應考就有六百二十人這　驚人的數目！</p>
<p>承蒙生活書店經理甘　園先生將此次招老練習生的底細，原原本本地吿訴記者、記者於傾聽之中，眞是不斷地打着寒噤！</p>
<p>在去年八月間廣州未淪陷之前，生這書店亦　　登報招考過練習生，報名應表的，却寥寥只有幾十人，成續亦十分平凡，結果一個都沒有取錄。這次呢，一來就六百二十人。根據應考者所填的表格　自我介紹的函件看來，成績不僅是　過去年招考的好多倍，簡直與上海招考的成續差不上下。</p>
<p>——這個事實够以說明往日所謂「，現在居然亦遍地滿是「文化人」的足跡了。</p>
<p>究竟是什麼待遇這樣使人趨之若鶩呢？</p>
<p>擄查這次只要取錄四名練習生，除供給膳宿外，每月薪水是港幣八元。要？服務成成優良，擢升爲職員時，月薪可就有港幣二十元以上。</p>
<p>這次在應考的青年羣衆中，固然有很多是爲着熱心服務文化而來；但是，飽受「生活鉄鞭」所驅策的，舉竟亦是　數不少。那麽，如何在六百二十人之中挑選四人呢？辦法就是根據其表格與函件選擇較優異者五十人，作爲初選合格；再定於明天（五日）假靑年會舉行考試。科目計有國文，常識，珠算與口試。以便正確地，公平地考取四個錄用。甘先生還鄭重表示該店所希望的人村，除了對于文化有信心，能够認眞服務的一般條件之外，特別還要二十歲左右，天眞活潑的靑年。因爲老於社會經驗者，多數成見太深，腦袋裏儘是渣滓的東西，好不容易轉變過來，淸潔過來。靑年人雖然是「幼稚」一些「經驗」亦不多，但是，勇於學習，容易進步，記者根據前此的體騐，對於甘先生用人的態度，亦深深地興起會心的微笑。</p>
<p>記者叩詢在這次招考中，有沒有「介紹」與「求情」的情事發生？甘先生答謂：有是有的，但是，爲數絕少。凡是不憑目己本事而托人求情的，絕對不予取錄。但是，介紹應考者的生平爲人，俾便錄取時的參考，倒是十分歡迎。</p>
<p>究竟這六百二十人的情形是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>可以這樣說：百分之九十是失業的，失學的流亡知識靑年。有一半以上，是逃難的教師。在這六白二十人中，從澳門來應考的，計　四十多人。女性應考的，亦佔七八十人的一個數目。論程度，高中學生與大學生頗不少，因爲有年齡廿五歲的限制，還是初中畢業生來得最多，大學生與高中生的成績亦不見得比初中學生強。亦許是因爲境遇决定他眞實的成就。在未經過複試之前雖然未能準確地分出軒輊，但是。據甘先生語記者，成績超羣，往日的工作臉度最使人同情的，是十九歲的一位初中畢業生，他在愛羣酒店當Boy。廣州淪陷後，才飄泊到香港來，記者看看他所填寫的表格，書法娟秀極了，在像片中，亦看出是英俊的一個少年。立刻教大聯想到那些養尊處優，而倒轉沒有半點墨汁的公子哥兒，眞要使人不勝感旣系之！</p>
<p>五日複試之後，能够實現繚繞在腦際的　想，眞的踏進生活書店的門檻，可以和「書本」與「讀者」做親密的朋友，而生活有所奇托的，畢竟只有四人而己，而其中六百一十六人將往何處去呢？</p>
<p>可愛可敬的靑年：回到祖國的懷抱吧！無論是前線是後方，處處在等待着優秀熱情的靑年去拓荒，去播種，，別躊躇在這兒苦惱！挺起胸膛，朝着勝利的前程，回到祖國的懷抱吧！</p>

<h3>歸自坪山游擊區（）</h3>
<p>— 朱白水</p>
<p>—惠　人民游擊隊剪影—</p>
<p>憑弔殘危雄偉的戰壕</p>
<p>×機會先後到坪山轟炸多次、但并不損失絲毫、這兩天却沒有來、今天我們正在疏林下閒談着、忽聞炮聲、繼說敵機來襲、但結果并無具事、于是我們就往四郊去觀察、</p>
<p>坪山是惠陽寶安相間的一個要地、地近大鵬灣海、故常廣東未發生抗戰前、駐軍莫希德隊部在道一帶預築許多重要工事、當我們所私過的田疇崗巒、邵很　固而整齊的構築着、許多戰壕、極能利用地形　物的戰地條件、如前臨　　田疇、下臨危壁深洞、而于密密叢林中、構築着深深戰壕工事、假如有優良火器倚重守備、×人都不易進攻的、</p>
<p>這種戰壕延綿廿餘里、非有　　以上不易防衛、同時在每</p>
<p>重要的地勢中、築　堅固的　關槍炮位、形勢非常險要、一道全用鋼鉄和水泥　築的地下室、是戰時官長作戰指揮用的、另一道奇折曲灣從山腰直達山脚的機關槍室底走道、其堅固密要和雄偉、令人驚嘆、也令人叫絕、</p>
<p>然而、像雲夢樣的意想本到這種化了不少人力物力的工事、于×人進攻時未嘗動用絲毫、因爲在駐防軍的意思是、×人祗會從東南面進攻、又誰知×人是次進佔坪山是用四面包抄襲擊的形勢、結果駐防軍以腹背受敵、因而倒曳而　、</p>
<p>我們慢慢地奔踏在這遍山遍野都是殘危雄偉的戰壕間、不禁黯然憑弔、一種嘆息和悽惋的情緒、濃郁地浮動着、過去　敗的事實、是給予我們莫入的教訓、我們也祗有從這種慘敗的教訓中、去爭取未來更大的勝利、</p>
<p>民眾和他們是一片的</p>
<p>一個下午在惠　、游擊隊參謀長鄭晉先生、帶着我們到郊外實習練靶去、</p>
<p>大家都非常高興的伏在草地上、描準了槍向槍靶　去、</p>
<p>每個人都願意做一個民族解放鬥爭的射擊手啊、</p>
<p>歸途中、已近黃昏、溫和的斜陽浴着田疇和樓房、這時總隊長曾生先生也啦、干是我們談笑地踏着歸途、</p>
<p>初來當時所見到坪山的居民、和他們親熱地招待的情況　又　新活現了、每個民衆都那麽誠坦的邀請曾總隊長和我們進他們的屋裏去坐、一個瞎了眼睛的賣桔子的人、拼命拉曾總隊長進去喝茶、一個姓黃的人、更把我們全體請進去屋裏去、亮着油燈、盛出許多花生、米餅、香烟助茶　、誠懇的招待着、那種真墊的溶洽的印象、便我永將不忘、</p>
<p>我可以說、在數天之內、惠寶人民游擊隊給我印象最深的、是和當他的民衆完全眞正地打成一片、民衆受戴着他們、他們更　衛着民衆、幫助民衆、和民衆分不開的生活着、</p>
<p>在坪山民衆現有的組織是、游擊隊、同志會、自衛團、冬防隊數種、都是由惠寶游擊隊負責指導的、因爲地們不能够爲惠寶人民盡量的滅途民衆苛捐雜稅、所以鄰近的農民都遠　跑來坪山做買賣、同時他們經常去幫助農村割麥、種田、肩担、和淸潔市墟的街道、免費醫治民衆疾病、召開民衆大會　、每件工作都使民衆們感到游擊隊是人民的好朋友、</p>
<p>最近他們更組織了新春舞獅隊和演劇歌唱隊等、到回鄉去做民衆運動工作、極獲得民衆們的興感和稱贊、</p>
<p>在保衛鄉土的抗戰中、爵取民衆、組織民衆和武裝民衆是一件急不容緩的工作、惠地游擊隊確是良好的模範、這種進步的游擊隊、也可以保衛東江、中英的戰士、</p>
<p>生活，工作，鬥爭，在飛躍着！</p>
<p>飯後的黃昏、在鄉村裏是含有愉暢而柔和的晚風的、</p>
<p>一簇簇的人跳踏在這院下的庭前或疏林下、雄壯的歌聲又在飄盪着、最練熟的是「國共合作進行曲」啦、</p>
<p>晚　　例定的游戲開始了、男的女的全是活躍也圍坐在一個圈子、近乎放縱的朗笑着、玩的是「捉迷藏」和「擁護領袖」、不特是他們自己玩、連參謀長和政治指導員也拉在一起玩了一大頓、參謀長被　、來了太極拳才算了　、</p>
<p>年青的富有生命力的興奮地生活着、游擊隊就是這樣、</p>
<p>現在他們大每的生活是活潑而緊張的、除了每天規定早起後越野跑步、至飯後即開始學習術科的游擊戰衛、如射擊法、夜行　等、學科的政洽、如論持久戰、統一戰線等、每大六時至下午四時正、晚上是自由習作、八時要睡了、但　上常常舉行越野夜行軍的、因爲游擊隊是需要其練熟夜行才能門爭的、附近的山嶺快要給他們爬過了、并且要於夜間派出哨乒、到附近山嶺站崗、撮近時局緊張了、還要加派排哨、一去要跑十餘廿里遠的、</p>
<p>在生活的學習上、除了個人的學習外、還每部沒有簡的圖書室、書籍都是　　游擊戰學方面的、除外、辦有一個中山室、專門是以加強每個隊的學習、　常出版壁　、舉行政治討論、問題　論等座談會、</p>
<p>最近還有油印出版物一份「軍民週刊」、　出創刊　、內容很不錯、是分派到各友軍及民眾讀閱的、在我們快要離開的當中、又籌備了很多種富有意義的比賽、　壁報論文比賽、射靶比賽、賽距的跳高的、越山的都有、</p>
<p>以這許多實際的情形、我們可以看到專　人民游擊隊本身的生活和工作、完全是在紀律化、活潑和嚴肅下發展着、目前的主要任務是動員民衆、肅淸漢奸、防止土匪活動、幫助政府推行戰時工作、鞏固本身和擴大組織、提高部隊的戰鬥能力、使到每個員隊、都在將來能成爲游擊隊的幹部才幹、更做成保衛鄉土、爭取民族自由解放的英勇鬥士、</p>
<p>附記、筆者這次到坪出逗留的時間很短、永能更具體的更深刻的把道活躍面優秀的民族戰士底姿態寫出來、是遺憾的、同時有許多事關軍事上的和環境上的、都不便披露、這也無奈的、　（完）</p>

<h3>銀星的自我檢討</h3>
<p>— 云</p>
<p>—同樣的也能幫助你—</p>
<p>人無遠盧，必有近憂。這話是中外相同的。好萊塢的一羣影人，高踞明星寶座，收入令人艷羨的巨額薪金，但是聰明的人仍舊時時返顧，在我一條可靠的退休之路，以前很多人，都是積蓄金錢，購置產業或作信用放款。到現在，事情已不是這麽簡單了，已有人說過：十萬金元的銀行存摺，不如一技隨身。而下面的十個問題，是十位紅得發紫的大明星所提出的，他們所以自己對於自己發問，都是希望有備無患，以作將來的歸路。我們的紅星也不在少數，在光芒四射之餘，也會準備過自己的問題嗎？</p>
<p>（一）你在從事影業之外，還兼有其他進欵的事業嗎？　——格茵黛法雷</p>
<p>（二）你具有應付一切的普通常識嗎？　——珍妮麥唐納</p>
<p>（三）你能只帶一枝獵鎗和些簡單的野宿用具，獨自在樹林中過十天嗎？　——克拉克蓋勃爾</p>
<p>（四）你能忠於艱苦困難的工作，不辭職嗎？　——埃洛弗林</p>
<p>（五）你能用新聞記者的攝影箱，攝出良好的相片嗎？　——李思廉霍華</p>
<p>（六）你智識上的準備比物質上的準備充實嗎？　——露意絲蘭納</p>
<p>（七）你能爲一個或甚至二十個人作飯和治家嗎：此問限於女孑——桃樂絲德里奧</p>
<p>（八）你曾爲你的鄰人的福利，盡過眞實的責任嗎？——貝錫萊斯朋</p>
<p>（九）你能爲正義和平而加入戰爭嗎？——？華倫威廉</p>
<p>（十）若是你眼前的計劃失敗，你能重新幹起，絕無沮喪之色嗎？？——威廉鮑惠爾，</p>
<p>在這十大明星所發的意見之後，瓊白朗黛兒也給了女人們一個　有的解答。她說：『找一個能應合以上一切問題的男子做丈夫，是女人們最可靠的歸路，』當然，她這話不是言出無因，她己經找到了她的狄克鮑惠爾了。</p>
<p>幾位大明星為什么不快活</p>
<p>（續昨）</p>
<p>『比起那些風流周儻的男星來、　在攝影場上必須要加倍的努力、他們一登銀壇、立刻有人擁護、而我呢、在每一仙簡單的鏡頭都要小心翼翼的用出全副演技來、所以我所需要的是深刻有力的劇情和活潑生動的角色、而這種角色、每年却沒有幾個派到我演、』</p>
<p>讓我們冉訪問喬治賴甫脫、他也是其中的一員、而且另有史好的理由不滿他的僱主、</p>
<p>『公司不給我一點思考的餘地、似乎我應該完全照他們所想的那樣做才對、　要我略略表示抗議、他們就說『喬治、你不能安靜些好好的幹嗎、以前你一星期只傘二百元的時候、倒是脾氣怪好的、而現在你有這們大的薪水、倒反這樣不好那樣不好起來了」、</p>
<p>「我的意思是、旣然是大薪水的明星、那末教在事業上是成功了、至少對不合意的事情總該有說兩句話的權利罷、比方說、許多明星有他們私人的開麥拉曼、我沒有、許多影星有私人的寫作家幫他們劇本上的忙、我也沒有、甚至我的巨額薪水也不甚够用、我一定要住一所很好的公寓、這就得花不少錢、要是我住到那些比較差的房子裏的話、連公司裏也要替我害羞了』</p>
<p>也許　想；「那有什麼關係駝、旣然他們不好好的待你、讓他們替你害羞就完了」</p>
<p>可是喬治不能這樣想、他的因難正多　、搖搖頭、他說、</p>
<p>「不行、不能那麽辦、我還是想極力好好的幹、……可是、看看那些他們派給我的角色罷—翻來覆去的又是那一套、毫無雙化、我想做點別的角色、祗是得不到一个相當機會』、</p>
<p>他也想演別種角色？巧得得很、可是你問他想演員　角色時、他又不痛快地說出來、</p>
<p>「我自已曉得就是了、」聲音　悲　的、他的煩惱確是不小、</p>
<p>「聽着」、他　　的說、「我只想能穿上一套制服就够了」、</p>
<p>這就是好萊塢的變化、每个人都不大快活、各有各的現由、而其中、看來喬治該是最煩惱的一个、（以）</p>
<h3>首輪影片介紹　舞曲大王</h3>
<p>— 維</p>

<p>魯意絲雷納在片中飾演佐漢史的髮妻、一個典型的賢內助、萬分熱誠的敬愛她的丈夫、更卻始終未敢把他佔爲己有、同時還犧牲了自己的權利與快樂、玉成他丈夫的事業、這個富有東方色調的女明星、在已往各片中有一種獨特的性格表演、嬌婉而且細膩的演作、嘗感動過每一觀衆的心絃、她優越的演技、嘗一連榮獲兩年度美國電影藝術研究會的金像獎、在本片中她是最令觀注意的人物、飾演紅伶的是美麗莎歌治絲、她本身就是歐洲舞台界的紅　、在這初次現身銀幕中、她超越的歌喉、作她向觀衆最好的自我介紹、她是一個電影界的新發現、無論在演技與歌唱藝術上一樣樣都是與珍妮麥　　媲美而無遜色、她前途的造就正是無可限量、男主角芬納格拉佛的演技、也優秀可喜、</p>
<p>本片的特　、不單是歌舞場面的偉大動人、戀愛情節的　緻艷賦、與夫齊整優秀的音樂團、而是對於此作曲家作曲時的心境、和造就他那心的環境、都能作極微妙極精細的描寫、像片中維也納山林中的一幕、在一個美麗　和的晨曦中、佐漢史伴着愛侶、　遊於媚的維也納山林中、那時花香烏語、潺潺的流水伴奏着牧童們淸越的簫聲、馬蹄踏自音韻的節　、他靠了　大自然的歌發、而做成了一維也納山杯一的一篇偉作、提琴的演奏、　是片中出色的節目、其中還有一具世界上最名貴價值八萬美金的提　中的珍品、收音完美　能全部保存精　、　有美驟的音律、</p>

<h3>今天甲組足球聯賽　四華軍全體出動　五營炮兵對米杜息亦關係重要</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】今天球城裏、有幾幕够刺激的戰事舉行、一般迷民、可各適其適、擇其所妤而參戰、</p>
<p>南華南對光華、南華華對聖約瑟、分上下塲在加山舉行、又是連樓好戰、東方則渡海出征、與「地頭蛇」九龍會競爭於該塲、亦信得過此役比較其他更緊張與可觀、</p>
<p>南南與東方、現居於續分表第二三名位置、前途希望、　爲濃厚、假如南南此後長勝下去、仍可獲得冠軍、若東方亦一樣的不再失敗、亞軍亦可到手、總之、此兩隊今後之成敗、關係大局、有舉足輕重之勢、並錄前三名現勢如下、</p>
<p>乙組五營炮兵對米杜息一役，於錦標問題、關係重大、如炮兵得勝、便穩獲冠軍、否則、南華與米軍相與崛起、又從中逐鹿了、前三名現勢如下、</p>
<p>南華對光華一役、論人才和實力、光華均有不及、在理、南南必勝、然光華各員近來勤於練習、全體均有進步、尤其在上半時『高速率』的演出、無論任佝強隊對之都會感受其威脅、所以、今天光華雖自問决難逃一敗、但其崩潰的形勢定不會在上半時、至怕在下半時的最後二十分鐘、故請球迷們注意此點、試看我的推測對不對、</p>

<h3>想到搶球</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>足球是踢的，但球迷——包括踢球人在內，似總有一个迷夢，最好球能老不離開脚頭。脚在抓方面是不大爭氣的，於是有人歡喜允許用手的橄欖球戲。這仍叫作足球，實際大可以不論足而論球。在這種球戲裏，球被一个人　着守住多久的事，仍然是不常見。沒有球的人的任務，原來就是去搶，而抓住球的人的目的，也在被搶，如果一个人湊巧剛在完場時得球，自然別人都任其抓住而不顧，則他對這抓住也就意興索然了。這類競技的基礎，全建築在競奪目標只有一个上。我們恐怕不能希望會有一種每人各有一球的賽球戲。只有小孩子玩球時，有時可以見到雖然每个都一个球，仍然有或是覺得別人的較好，或是想多得一个，或是想每個都玩到的情形。</p>
<p>這種原始形式的爭奪，我們很會輕蔑地給與以一个名稱，兒戲。可況似乎人類除了在遊戲方面，能製造種種規律以外，却不大能給別種事製作什麽規律，而反是遊戲中的兒戲，才只見之於兒童，而其他方面的兒戲，却多是成人幹的。我們憤常把國際政局比作球戲，實在還比得過高，這裏並不是因爲想到賽球，忽然跳出這一聯想，相反，實是因在地圖看到那靴形的地方，和靴邊的球，不由想到地理上的球將如何玩法，於是想開去想小回來，倒儘就玩球方面想下去。</p>
<p>地理上的球是不能動的，也許這就根本使它和玩球比不起來。各大洋海中的島嶼，頗有種作某某洋的寶石的，擬稱爲球的說法，却還沒有。可是在覬覷者的眼中，雖然更像寶石，而在持有者手中，却更像球，尤其是在靴子旁邊，我們不能不連想起球來。地中海是一座老球場。場上的議員屢有愛更，而同批的球員，也不一定是玩同一個球，不過靴邊的那一隻只終不失爲重要的一隻。失去這　球的，都成爲失敗者，自然不必說，並且凡玩過這隻球的　也都是失敗者。誰有權利說這隻球最先是他的，我們不知道，我們知道在很早時期，它曾經是希臘的過，希臘終因他而受了致傷命，迦太基人似也該有較大的佔有權利，其亡國也幾全是爲了它，這類故事是說不完的，中間甚至且有球場靴子的情形，其最後因爲別個球更見重要，而致這隻球顯得冷落，倒未始非此球之幸。不久前　球再登塲活躍，以致使所謂地中海的心臟也停止跳動，自然再激起大海中的波濤了。</p>
<p>球的運命似乎是該轉來轉去，而不能永遠貼牢在一隻脚上的。球　自然有球能老小離開腳頭的幻夢，可是作為兒童看，未必不是因看中了別人的球，專心想去搶奪，竟忘却了自已　邊的球呢。</p>
<h3>李長人</h3>
<p>— 麗天</p>
<p>李胤係一個上尉階級的軍佐。，因爲他的身村，常人特別是高出五六寸多；所以在一般人的眼光中，首先發覺他的特徵的，就是他的身長。常他每聽到號兵吹着集合號的時候，在他緊束了他腰間的精神帶以後，便　不客氣地，昂然站在橫排的第一位，常有「目空一切」的氣概。在軍中，無論他的平輩軍官或上官，都叫他做「高佬」，（廣東土語即長人的意思）而不呼他的名字，甚至供他着役的勤務兵，在　裏也有叫他的「徽號」的。</p>
<p>在晨光曦微的一個早上，陸軍第××師××團奉命開抵目的地了。官兵們在充滿着準備一演好身手的渝快表情中，各自的或合作的忙于應幹的工作。素有長人稱的李胤，帶着一個下級官長和兩個士兵，跑到對面的小崗上，拿起掛在項上的望遠鏡，對準着前面隱約的烟塵籠罩中的一帶村落，忽左忽右地瞭望着。那時他們的耳朵，巳逐漸聽得到淸晰的礟聲了。</p>
<p>團部接到哨兵的報吿：前面的×人有向西南沿這公路進襲我們陣地的企圖，以唐克軍爲前　的情報。那時，我們的平射砲，己活躍地移到公路的側面，準備着開始我們神聖的任務。</p>
<p>軋碌！軋碌！一種異乎尋常的車聲，像萬馬奔騰般由遠而近；接着砰砰的礟聲，槍聲，手溜彈聲，鬧得震天　嚮，飛揚的泥土，遮蓋着大地。從稍遠的樹林裏，偷偷地瞧去，公路的旁邊，×人的一輛鐵甲車跛　　了，這樣拉鋸式的炮戰，一進一退地仍然是支持着。</p>
<p>二十分鐘後，空中發現××的×機聲來了，最初是成品字形的三架，隨後東北方來的共有七架了。到了戰地的上空，便各目離　的繚繞盤旋，正像急於覓食的一羣餓鷹。在卜卜的一片機關槍聲向下射之後，接着轟轟的炸彈聲。蹲在李長人左邊的一個方捩着槍機的士兵細聲的對他說：「呀，團部中彈着火了」！在他繼續靜聽（機投下的炸彈聲中，忽然聽到一聲　山崩地裂的巨響，原來我們的平射炮陣地也中彈了。</p>
<p>殺呀！殺呀！轟！轟！轟轟！×人的鐵甲車唐克車衝過我們的陣地之後，跟着來的是馬隊，雜着各種聲響裏的一片喊殺聲，便是我們由戰壕裏躍出的衝鋒隊，和×人的馬隊肉搏的時候。</p>
<p>約莫經過了一個鐘頭以後，李長人在這種殺人的聲息逐漸停止以後，從茅草堆中伸出了他的頭，瞧瞧他的前面，除了排列着無數的屍體，和將死而禾死正在呻吟着的傷兵外，大地巳漸歸於靜寂，好像忘記了剛才熱烈的一幕了。</p>
<p>他好像在大夢初覺地醒了過來，試探地爬到公略的近旁：因爲他身長的原故，爲減少目標計，他灣着腰肢像駝子般走着，可是他的脚跟一踏上了公路，便看第在×營杜連長壯烈在犧牲了。他把他的屍旁的駁壳槍搶在自己手裏，忽忙地離開了公路，朝着那方叢林跑，經渦了很廣寬的平疇，終於到了一個荒崗，這裏大約離開當日的戰場有多少里。他站見這崗的頂點，吐了一口氣，用手際一擦身上染滿着黃泥的軍衣，用力地從新結束着他的精神帶，像指揮官發號令般喝着：</p>
<p>「那個是×師×團的官兵，趕快地跑出來！跟着我走！」</p>
<p>從山腰的後面，應聲跳下來的，是一個還佩着少尉　級符號的官長，和一個傳令兵。</p>
<p>「我們的部隊，朝着那方移去了呢？」他搶着問。</p>
<p>「大約向西北方××鄉撤退去！」傳令兵行了敬禮後答着，同時用手指示着方向。</p>
<p>他們三個人，都朝着這個方禹加速地向前跑；傳令兵在前，他和少尉官長在後。</p>
<p>一會兒，一陣馬蹄好像從山後　來了，他喝着：</p>
<p>「不好了，×人馬隊搜索到了，我們快向那邊蔗林散開！」　（未完）</p>
<h3>關於牆頭小說</h3>
<p>— 特拉</p>
<p>在這理我記得杜埃君在大索日本主編副刊的一個時期，他對於牆頭小說都曾經熱烈地提倡並且也會經鼓勵了靑年們對於這種小說的創作，而發表了不少可觀的短篇，吸引了許多讀者同情與愛護，因此我們得要承認牆頭小說在此地的確曾經茁發過了它的花葩，這在文藝邋動七面，我們也應當承認其光輝的價值。</p>
<p>但我們也不妨坦白地說一句，現在我們已經看不到牆頭小說在此地的文壇上活躍着了。這是不是牆頭小說已經不爲人們所愛好，是不是牆頭小說已經結東了他的可愛前途？决不是的。主要的還是由於我們的文藝運動工作者對於此種創作沒有加以積極的　導，文藝園取裏的作者與編者對於這種創作還未能取到一致的態度。這在今天我們應有加以檢討的必要了。</p>
<p>爲着要使大家不忘於牆頭小說的意義與作用，我們要鄭重的指出，在抗戰文學的　階段上，眞正大衆的或適合於大衆的作品，是應該多量的產生，便是從牆頭移印在紙下，或從紙上抄寫到牆頭的潑　而又尖　，諷刺的或寫實故事的短篇，經常地發表，這都是有着非常意義與作用的一件事。這樣，我們就可以了解牆頭小說的特點，是在於採用經濟的手法，藝術的，煽動的筆調來勾引人的注目，它的題材總是片斷的，事件的一點或一面的刻畫，它每每連同着漫畫或特製的揷圖來一道發表，這是極有趣味的事情。</p>
<p>在蘇聯的工廠與農塲裏牆頭小說的出現對於社會主義的建設，都盡了推動的有效作用。而從寫作者中也常常可以訓練或產生出來一些特出的創作家，偉大的社會主義文學後備軍。</p>
<p>目前在日本，工場勞動和大衆的新聞紙之間，也學取了牆頭小說這種方式，而推動了大衆的反戰文學連動，並且也有了一些收穫與成果。</p>
<p>這些都應當做着我們的榜樣，我很希望那些自命爲忠於抗戰文藝的寫作者和編輯人大家提起精神注意一下牆頭小說的作品，總比　寫那些與登那些跟抗戰無關的所謂「軟性」文章的趣蟽小品好得多罷。</p>
<h3>不足為奇</h3>
<p>— 莫邪</p>
<p>賣國賊古已有之，不目我始，不足爲奇。烏龜忘八都是人故的，我亦猶人耳，姑妄爲之，不足爲奇。笑罵由他笑罵，好官我自爲之，不足爲奇。……</p>
<p>天下有多少罪惡，都在這不足爲奇的自解中，輕輕地造成了。不足爲奇，專門文過飾非，簡直是惡劣而不祥的名詞。</p>
<p>然而不足爲奇，又未可以一概而論，用之得　當，却往往又能壯人的胆，長人的志氣，而於某種事件上著其成效。</p>
<p>見怪不怪，　怪目敗，正是不足爲奇的最好註釋。例如×人有猛烈的槍砲，不足爲奇，我們有血肉造成的新的長城：×人或者花言巧語，或者強詞奪理，搖惑人心，不足爲奇，我們自有我們的主張：×人大誇海口，虛　恫嚇，不足為奇，我們的意志很堅定，泰山崩於前而色不變。……</p>
<p>不過在這一個不足爲奇之下，可見我們必須有所恃，有所以自處之道，那才好，否則這不足爲奇，又將成爲一種解等，有如下列的舉例：</p>
<p>陳後主聽見附師渡江的消息，還是和宮女們唱着玉樹後庭花，不足為奇變成了有毒的定心丸。元兵己迫建康，麗似道認爲割地納幣足以了之，還是鬥促織要緊，不足爲奇誤了國，誤了他自已。李自成破居庸關而直入，明廷一般大臣，還是酣歌恒舞，醉生夢死，不足爲奇，一變而爲死有餘辜。</p>
<p>這樣的不足爲奇，是什麽解釋呢？無非是有意不買賬，存心撤爛污。</p>
<p>於此，我總已經知道應否不足爲奇，並且在何種狀況之下才可以不足爲奇吧。</p>
<p>不過以上所說的，都是國家大事，似乎範圍太大些，在個人方面說來，這不足爲奇，又將怎樣適用呢？我自己來作個例子：</p>
<p>有人對我說，某人變了，變壞了，我說，不足爲奇，世界本來容易使人變壞，有人升官發財了，我說，不足爲奇，機會本來大家都有的，有人無端刻薄我陰損我我一笑置之，覺得不足爲奇，因爲人心險惡，早在我的意中，有人要我去看新出現的西洋景，東洋景，我不去，因爲我知道受到什麽煩腦，苦楚，困阨，顛沛，舉凡一切不堪的事情，我都將不足爲奇來一筆勾消之，我承認不足爲奇對我有極大的妙用，我時常在應用着它。</p>
<p>甚至我遇到眞正可以自殺的境地，我也活下去，原因便是死這件事，在我看來也是不足爲奇，人人都會自殺，都會死，我名何必落人陳套，步人後塵呢。</p>
<p>這也許還是我的消極不足爲奇，有些不足爲訓吧，然而我覺得任何湯裏火裏的事情，在我看來，還都不是足爲奇，我都可以榦得，假使環境和機會都允許我的話。我自已也分不出我的不足爲奇究竟是消極，是積極的。</p>
<p>我不知道現在的人有無不足爲奇的觀念，更不知道他們的不足爲奇假使有，是什麽種類，到了什麽程度，我這樣說，大家或者也要說我不足為奇吧。</p>
<h3>「保生」與「卹死」</h3>

<p>最近，因偽「維新政府」和各地大小偽員的一再被狙身死，弄得那些新貴們，人懷自危之心，無時無刻不提防着這「舛運」的落自己身上，因他們雖愛高官厚祿，但更愛他們各自的生命呀。</p>
<p>俗語說，「要錢不要命」，人爲了要『錢』，便不顧「命」，這種爲「錢」而見危授「命」的行爲，倒也尚不失爲守財虜中的「英豪」，現在，這些新貴們，既捨得得錢又珍惜着命，這種魚與熊掌兼得的心理，實在還不够不上說「要錢不要命」哩，你看近來那些新貴們，那一個不出入都有保鏢　衛着傳聞　逆彼庵，在市府辦公時，也要實行臨時戒嚴，可見其心寒胆怯了，其他在僞「機關」內辦事的那些偽員們，鑒於近來除奸案的層出不窮，也都談虎色變，紛紛要求「維新政府」要設法予以生命的保障，但「維新政府」接得是項哀吿後，一度秘密集議，僉以服務於偽「機關」裏的大小偽員們，不能「保生」，但可恤死，換句話說，就是那些「維新要人」們自己的生命，也還保不周全，更那有餘力來保僚屬的生命，偽員們一且遇刺殞命，除撥一筆「撫恤金」與遺旗的生命維待費外，便一無善策，新貴們在這時，不知感覺到失節的悲哀否？</p>
<p>據電訊所傳，『維新政府』的撫卹偽員條例，規定僞「特任官」十萬元，偽「簡任官」五萬元，偽『　任官三萬元，其他依宮級大小，依次遞減。新貴的『身價』，倒還定得不低，被刺死的新貴們，大可瞑目於衆下，因他們的臭皮囊，還可　得如許高價，豈非出乎意料外的事，「救生乏術，恤死有方』，把這副春聯去貼到「維新政府」的大門上，倒是很貼切的。</p>

        <h1>1939.03.04</h1>
<h3>Observation of the Japanese Arsenal Explosion</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news agencies widely reported the explosion of a certain arsenal in Osaka, Japan, the tragedy of which can be described as unprecedented: "The number of casualties within the arsenal cannot yet be determined, but the number of dead and injured around the arsenal has exceeded one hundred" (Central News Agency telegram), "Two areas of the disaster zone have been almost leveled to the ground, and thousands of residents have been left homeless" (Haitong News Agency). This incident is certainly not an ordinary occurrence, and we should deeply recognize the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The arsenal explosion incident should be seen as a tragic disaster inflicted upon the Japanese people by the Japanese aggressors. Japanese aggressors manufacture munitions for the invasion of foreign countries, not only harming the general population through the decline of peaceful industries and financial burdens, but also bestowing unspeakable tragedies upon workers inside the arsenal and residents in the surrounding area in this kind of situation. We, of course, express our deep condolences for the suffering of the Japanese people, but on the other hand, we cannot help but remind the Japanese people to seriously reflect: the root cause of the disaster lies in the war of aggression. If the Japanese warlords did not manufacture munitions for the war that destroys humanity, if the Japanese warlords did not rush to manufacture munitions and accumulate munitions for the war of aggression, then Japan would not have such a dangerous cause, and such a tragic disaster would not have occurred. The Japanese people will not only die on the battlefields of China and be displaced in foreign countries because of the war of aggression, but also be oppressed by various heavy burdens at home and be visited by disasters like the arsenal explosion. If the war of aggression does not stop, it is believed that such tragedies cannot be avoided and will continue to occur.</p>
<p>(2) What should be investigated more deeply about this incident is the cause of its occurrence. Two days have passed since the disaster occurred, but the news agencies have not mentioned the cause in their telegrams. Although the Japanese government's announcement stated that "order within the disaster area remains as usual, and the residents are extremely calm," the truth is unknown. Of course, the Japanese government will not truthfully disclose it. However, we should know that the storage of munitions in various countries is very strict and cautious, and Japan's fire prevention organization is also very thorough. Of course, it would not be easy to catch fire, but yesterday's disaster broke out, and continued to burn until last night, affecting an area as wide as one square mile. The cause of its occurrence is worth investigating. We still clearly remember that shortly after Japan launched its war of aggression against China, the Japan Maru arsenal was exploded by workers, and many Osaka Ping factories often heard of workers' strikes. The news of the mutiny of new recruits in Kawasaki and Senju in the Tokyo heavy industrial area was also made known to the general public through the transmission of Japanese revolutionaries (Mr. Kaji Wataru's speech in Wuhan), and the news that a certain arsenal in Taiwan was burned down by the Communist Party was also learned in detail from the newspapers. In short, the Japanese workers are moving, especially the workers in the arsenals, just as Mr. Kaji Wataru said, "grasping the lifeline of Japanese imperialism." Last year, the miners in Akita Prefecture once led local farmers in a joint riot (according to Mr. Kaji Wataru's report at the welcoming meeting of twelve cultural groups in Wuhan), and now the Japanese farmers have gradually united with the workers to fight because of their increasingly deteriorating circumstances. We cannot but pay close attention to this initial form of arson and explosion incident of the Japanese workers' and peasants' uprising.</p>
<p>(3) An event that is immediately thought of in connection with the arsenal explosion is the ease with which Japanese urban houses are burned down, and the ability of various urban facilities such as power lines and gas pipes to help spread fires. The vast majority of Japanese houses are made of wooden boards and straw, and power lines and gas pipes are "open-air" constructions in Japanese urban areas, so once a fire occurs, they have the effect of helping to spread it. This time, the fire from one arsenal caused the disaster area to be as large as one square mile, and more than nine hundred houses were destroyed. There is a reason for this. Here, we can also think of the possibility of how tragic disasters will occur when Japanese cities encounter heavy bombing by the Soviet Union in the future. Japan's essence is concentrated in the three major urban areas of Hanshin, Keihin, and Fukuoka. Osaka is so easy to burn down, and we can easily imagine that the destruction of the entire Japanese people is also a work of crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. The Japanese people should be aware: "To prevent the arrival of this tragic fate, the only way is to find a way to stop the war of aggression."</p>
<h3>One Week of World Trends</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From February 25th to March 2nd</p>
<p>This week, straddling February and March, is like the ever-changing weather of spring. There have been major changes in international affairs as well. Particularly noteworthy are the declarations by the British and French governments recognizing the Spanish rebels and their puppet regime, and the rejection of the U.S. Guam fortification plan. These changes will naturally affect the Far East situation, thus showing the sudden and dramatic turn of the Japanese military aggression against China, and the tense situation of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. What is the significance of all these developments, and what new developments will there be? Here we present a brief report:</p>
<p>British and French Recognition of Spanish Rebels</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Bonnet announced on February 26 that the French government recognized the Franco regime of the Spanish rebels, and the British government also formally announced on February 2 that it recognized the Franco regime. This move by the British and French rulers can be regarded as the highest degree of expression of the so-called "non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War" for two years and eight months. For the benefit of their few financial capitalist leaders, they consider themselves to be wise men who recognize the times, hoping to simultaneously obtain the right to compete and develop in Spain with Italy and Germany, and even fantasize about changing the aggressive and adventurous route of Italy and Germany, and organizing a European anti-Soviet front. However, this move by the British and French rulers will obviously yield the opposite results. As the Soviet Union's Pravda stated on March 2: "The British and French recognition of the Franco regime is a new stage in the development of the Second World War, in which fascists attack British, American, and French democracies to redistribute the world. It is a second Munich Agreement in which Britain and France yield to fascism." Recent facts show that (1) Franco expressed indifference to the British and French recognition, which is obviously the attitude of his chief backers, the Italian and German authorities; (2) Italy and Germany have made no statement on this, and they are planning how to take advantage of the favorable situation of continued weakness shown by Britain and France to carry out new adventures. On March 1, London newspapers reported that Hitler and Mussolini would meet again. (3) The aggressive and adventurous actions of Italy and Germany are becoming more and more intense, such as the failure of the Palestine talks, the spread of the anti-British movement in South Ireland, and the sudden outbreak of the Mexican rebellion. (4) Japan is taking a more barbaric offensive in the Far East, arbitrarily threatening and assisting Britain and France. (5) The internal opposition movement in Britain is developing rapidly under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Labour Party. (6) The tide of popular anger against the government is rising simultaneously in France. (7) Spanish President Azaña resigned, and was succeeded by Barrio on March 2, indicating that the Spanish Republican government is determined to fight to the end for the freedom and republic of the people, no matter how bad the environment may be. These facts prove that: (1) the Spanish Civil War is not over, (2) the British and French policy of compromise has failed, and (3) the international situation is becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>British Denial of Guam Fortifications</p>
<p>The intensified performance of the British and French rulers in their appeasement policy towards the fascist period has made the world war crisis more serious, and at the same time, it has also increased the revolutionary sentiments and forces. However, the event of the U.S. House of Representatives rejecting the Guam fortification plan has caused pessimism and disappointment in all quarters. The purpose of the Guam fortification plan was to deal with Japan's naval construction on the Pacific mandated territories, and at the same time, it was of great assistance to Britain in protecting its Far East interests and to China's war of resistance. The rejection of the Guam fortification plan, on the one hand, shows the ambiguous attitude of the United States towards Japan's adventurous actions in the Far East, and on the other hand, it shows the inadequacy of the United States' sincerity in cooperating with Britain, France, and China. This move by the reactionary elements in the U.S. government is obviously an attack on Roosevelt's policy, and it has created a gloomy situation internationally. However, this is only a manifestation of the conspiracy of a few reactionary elements in the United States. After the rejection of this plan, not only did the people of the United States strongly oppose it, but the U.S. military authorities unanimously expressed their dissatisfaction. According to a Washington telegram on March 1, the U.S. Senate has taken steps to re-raise the issue of fortifying Guam next Monday; and within the $50 million military construction plan, $6 million for building defenses in Hawaii and the Canal Zone, and $4.285 million for building and consolidating coastal defenses in Hawaii and the Philippines have become a reality. The U.S. naval exercises are also continuing enthusiastically under the command of President Roosevelt, and the British and French authorities have agreed to cooperate by providing islands in various regions. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. policy of assisting democratic and peaceful countries, under the support of strong strength, will not have major changes.</p>
<p>Soviet Strengthening of Defenses in Vladivostok</p>
<p>What "complements" the U.S. military exercises is the Soviet Union's announcement on February 28 of a plan to build a strong navy. This plan seems to include the Soviet Union building the world's strongest navy in both Europe and Asia, after building the world's strongest air force, with the aim of enabling the navy of the socialist motherland to destroy the enemy's navy in the enemy's territorial waters. According to the report of Mr. Natikhin, director of the Political Department of the First Army of the Soviet Red Army, this plan will be realized soon, because the Soviet Union now has workers and factories that are capable of quickly manufacturing warships, artillery, and other new weapons. Last year, many warships and submarines were manufactured. Recently, in view of Japan's increasingly rampant adventurous actions in the Far East, the Soviet-Japanese fishery agreement disputes, and the continuous provocations by Japanese and puppet troops on the Soviet-Korean-Manchurian border, in addition to continuously strengthening the air defense of the Far East, several of the latest warships have been specially dispatched to join the Red Army's Far East Fleet to strengthen the defenses around Vladivostok. After the resolute oath taken by the leaders of the Red Army and the Communist Party, Stalin, on the 21st anniversary of the Soviet Red Army on February 23, Pravda clearly declared that "the Red Army is the fortress of world peace, neither intimidating nor being intimidated. The sympathy of the world's proletariat is a strong backing for the Red Army, and the spirit of the Red Army dedicating its life to the socialist motherland and the world's working masses and oppressed nations can be a loyal friendly force for all those seeking freedom and peace in the world." Particularly noteworthy is the development of the Soviet navy, especially the development of the Soviet Far East Fleet, which will have a major promoting effect on the cooperation between the British, American, and French navies. Japanese Navy Minister Yonai recently announced that he would build a large number of warships soon to compete with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which shows that the new Soviet navy is valued and its interests are consistent with those of Britain and the United States. At a time when Japanese aggressors are wantonly threatening Britain and France, the development of the Soviet navy has even greater significance, and the British, French, and American authorities have to support it. Recently, the British government decided to send a special commercial envoy to Moscow, and on the evening of March 1, Chamberlain made an exception to attend a banquet at the Soviet embassy, which Reuters pointed out as "this may be an indication of the British government's reconsideration of its relations with the Soviet Union." This is not an empty statement. (For detailed comments, please read the commentary on the fourth page today.)</p>
<p>Japan's New Adventurous Plan</p>
<p>The recent situation has given the Japanese aggressors the opportunity to launch a "Pacific September 18th Incident": First, the intensified performance of the British and French appeasement policy has given the Japanese a chance to take advantage of the weaknesses in the Far East; Second, the aggressive forces of Italy and Germany have already extended from Europe to the Americas and Asia, restraining the attention of democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, the United States, and France, making the Japanese even more emboldened to implement new adventures in the Far East; Third, the democratic and peaceful front based on the Soviet Union has begun to unite, consolidate, and develop under the further oppression of the fascist invaders and the policy of hypocritical weakness and surrender, and the Japanese are even more plotting to promote their new adventures before the peaceful front has completed its unification, consolidation, and development; Fourth, the new forces of China's war of resistance are developing day by day, and Japan's military aggression against China is on the verge of being forced to a standstill. They will naturally use new adventures to break this situation; Fifth, the domestic anti-war movement in Japan is rising under heavy guard and oppression (the explosion of the arsenal near Osaka from February 28 to March 2, which destroyed 900 houses and left 8,333 people homeless, and the loss of munitions exceeded 50 million yuan, and it will be difficult to repair and use it within a year, is one example). The anti-war, slack war, and mutiny movements within the Japanese invading army have become increasingly developed in recent times. The Japanese must take several measures. The Japanese are plotting to use new adventures to ease the development of this situation. The so-called new dangerous plan, one is to use serious incidents such as the seizure of Hainan Island, the bombing of the Hong Kong border, and the contention for the Shanghai concession to wantonly threaten and extort Britain and France; the first step is to stop the steps to aid China, the second step is to mediate China's war of resistance; the third step is to place the interests of Britain and France in the Far East under the Japanese-led "New Order in East Asia." The second is to begin to adopt the urgent offensive of various invading troops to restrain the offensive of our front-line troops, while at the same time stepping up the consolidation of the ruling forces in the occupied areas, the maintenance of transportation routes, and the new compilation and training of puppet troops, preparing for the final offensive.</p>
<p>One Week of the War of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>The new adventurous plan of the Japanese aggressors has had noteworthy manifestations in the past week. First, the three steps to threaten Britain and France. The British and French countermeasures to the Hainan Island incident were: (1) The authorities of the two countries reiterated the close cooperation between Britain and France, and discussed cooperation with the United States. (2) They separately declared that the British and French governments would never recognize any fait accompli, respect the Nine-Power Treaty, maintain the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, and adhere to the League of Nations resolution on assisting China. Therefore, Japan's landing on Hainan Island has not achieved any major success. Secondly, the British government adopted a serious and tough attitude towards the Luohu incident in the New Territories of Hong Kong, and the Japanese side accepted the apology and compensation, so it can also be considered a failure. As for the Shanghai Concession incident, after two weeks of storms, it has now calmed down slightly. However, the confrontation between Japan and Britain and France has not changed, and Japan's adventurous actions may be launched at any time. It is hoped that our friendly countries will be good at dealing with them, because only by taking practical steps to attack the aggressors can all threats and intimidations be eliminated. Secondly, regarding the Sino-Japanese war, in the past week, except for no particularly important battles in the Northwest Theater, in South China, after occupying Hainan Island, the Japanese have continued to threaten Beihai and other places, creating steps to attack the southern route and threaten Guangxi and Yunnan. However, because the attitude of Britain and France is not as submissive as it is in Europe, France has to increase its military strength in the Far East (limited to not being taken advantage of by Italy), and Britain is also actively strengthening its defenses in the Far East (such as the construction of the airplane field on Ceylon Island and the increased strength of Edinburgh Fortress). At the same time, our southwestern national defense forces are becoming increasingly strong, and Guangdong is ready to launch an offensive at any time, so that Japan has no way to succeed. Only the long-silent situation in Central China suddenly became tense this week. The Japanese north of the Yangtze River divided their troops and attacked westward along the Hanshui and Sichuan-Hankou routes, occupying Tianmen and Jingshan, and one part even crossed the Han River, heading for Jingmen, creating a situation of spying on Yichang and entering Sichuan, and plotting to attack Xiangyang and invade Shaanxi. South of the Yangtze River, troops have been transferred and generals have been deployed for days to actively prepare for military attacks on Nanchang and Changsha. On the one hand, they have harassed the Zhejiang coast with Hainan, and on the other hand, the army has separately attacked the guerrilla areas. According to the recent internal and external situation of the Japanese army, the Japanese have no plan to spy on Sichuan and Shaanxi, and they also have no power to open up the entire Yuehan line. Therefore, the sudden adventurous offensive is obviously an attempt to restrain our preparations for the offensive on each front line, so that they can step up the suppression of the resistance forces in the occupied areas and consolidate and strengthen their ruling power. At the same time, they will use this new adventure to boost the increasingly exhausted morale of the army and stop the increasingly intensified puppet army uprising and Japanese army anti-war actions. If this estimate is not too wrong, it is expected that there will be no major changes in the Northwest Theater, and the Yuehan line, Zhejiang and Jiangxi areas, and various occupied areas will be important combat areas, and the overall situation can be expected to remain stable. Our task is to quickly send larger troops to the guerrilla areas to help disrupt the rear of the Japanese army, greatly weaken the attacking power of the Japanese army, launch a large-scale mutiny of the Japanese army, and win more time to prepare for the counter-offensive. As for the conspiracy of the Japanese and Chinese traitors for "anti-communism, peace, and pro-Japan," it should not be ignored. The editorial of this newspaper yesterday spoke very clearly, and will not repeat it here.</p>
<h3>"Auntie's Garden" in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Know Me</p>
<p>The Historical Facts of the "Chef Old Master"</p>
<p>"Going to Chongqing without eating 'Auntie's Garden' is not understanding the true taste of 'Sichuan cuisine,' and it can be said that you have lived in Chongqing in vain." This sentence is the usual "catchphrase" of people living in Chongqing who are called "Jiangnan people." It is also a generally recognized definition.</p>
<p>However, a month ago, "Auntie's Garden" had already closed down, and some "old women" no longer had the opportunity to satisfy their taste buds. The reason for the closure was that the "Chef Old Master" of "Auntie's Garden" died suddenly of a heart attack, leaving behind the "Chef Old Master's" concubine, and the young master was unable to run the business, so he had to close down. The restaurant industry in Chongqing has been dimmed for a month, and the "Sichuan cuisine" recipe has been dimmed. This is truly a major loss in the scenery of Chongqing, worthy of the regret of the old gentlemen.</p>
<p>Speaking of the "Chef Old Master" of "Auntie's Garden," his background is very big. He was originally from Chengdu, Sichuan, and his name was "Huang Jinlin." If he were still alive this year, he would be a middle-aged man of sixty-two years old. It is said that he was the son of a noble family, and his ancestors had served as Beijing officials of the fourth or fifth rank or above in the former Qing Dynasty. He himself had also inherited a title. In the late Qing Dynasty, he served as a magistrate. Because he was fond of good food, he usually spent his efforts on cooking. He came up with his own unique ideas and created several dishes. Over time, it became a habit. Not only did it become a habit, but it also became an addiction. Whenever he had free time, he would cook dishes for his own amusement. The men, women, old, and young in his family were influenced by him, and over time, they all had this addiction. When he lived in his hometown of Chengdu, his residence was very spacious. He planted flowers and bamboos, and pushed some rocks, which was quite elegant. He also liked to associate with elegance, making friends with literati and poets, and hanging calligraphy, couplets, and scrolls all over the hall to decorate his residence. He himself could write a very good hand of calligraphy. He could write the styles of Huang Shigugu, Wang Youjun, Dongnan Palace, and Liu Shi'an in true, regular, and clerical script. So, he was praised by some idle "doufang celebrities," and his reputation was surprisingly high. In the past, when warlords divided Sichuan, the banquets of those in power were endless. Because the courtyard of the "Chef Old Master" was quiet, many people borrowed it for gatherings. Although the "Chef Old Master" had no intention of currying favor with the powerful, he sometimes volunteered to show off his skills and personally cook dishes. As time went by, it spread around that the "Chef Old Master" made guests feel at home. Almost every day, people borrowed his residence to set up banquets, and the "Chef Old Master" showed off his unique skills. The "Chef Old Master" gradually became a high-class private chef and slowly embarked on a professional path. When someone borrowed the residence for a banquet, the "Chef Old Master" did not charge a fixed fee, but only the cost of the vegetable materials, which was at least forty or fifty yuan per table, and the more, the better. When Yang Yongtai lived in Chengdu, he could be called the "Chef Old Master's" most intimate diner. Yang would not be happy if he did not eat the dishes cooked by the "Old Master." The "Old Master's" dishes, if not tasted by Yang, would be considered by others to be "Pigs eating ginseng. Eating without knowing the taste."</p>
<p>Later, Yang Yongtai sat in Hubei with authority, and sent a letter inviting the "Chef Old Master" to go there. Unfortunately, before the Old Master arrived in Chongqing, Yang was suddenly assassinated. The Old Master, with his family in transit, felt that returning to Chengdu like that would be embarrassing, so he simply stayed down and rented a residence at No. 1 Zhicheng Lane, Yangliu Street, Chongqing, with a plaque hung on the door that read: "Auntie's Garden." Although it was not as spacious as the old residence in Chengdu, it was a small courtyard with some flowers and plants, and it was still quiet. Military and political dignitaries from Chengdu still greeted the Old Master here, and the Old Master usually showed his "Yi Ya skills," demanding material fees, and cooking dishes. In the past three or four years, the name of the Old Master's "Auntie's Garden" has become famous far and wide, and almost everyone in Sichuan knows it. As there were many diners, there were also many people who praised him, and the people who came to "eat" were just "officials and not commoners." Under the promotion of these people, the Old Master's reputation became higher and higher. The Old Master was busy every day, and had the right to select diners. The opportunity to get the Old Master's promise to be your chef was becoming less and less.</p>
<h3>French Far Eastern Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— By Mr. F. Lemon, Translated by Ye Juesun</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] During my three months in China, the first question my Chinese friends asked me was: "What is France's Far Eastern diplomacy like?" They were especially eager to inquire about France's true attitude towards China. Of course, this was by no means a casual question, but an expression of special feelings, full of hope, friendship, and enthusiasm. At the same time, the special attention that the Chinese people pay to France's diplomatic attitude is by no means solely because French Annam and China have close geographical ties, but also because France is still the motherland of freedom and independence, and the guardian of international justice and democratic systems. Although France has not given China much help so far, the Chinese people's naive and firm trust in France has always remained deeply in their minds. Therefore, standing in the position of a "friend of China" and as a Frenchman who still has a glorious tradition of striving for freedom and independence, it is necessary to explain France's Far Eastern policy to friends who are on the path of struggle. Speaking of France's foreign policy, it is of course inseparable from the entire international situation in recent years. Since Hitler climbed onto the German political stage in 1933, Europe has progressed into its unfortunate situation, and this unfortunate element has been increasing at any time. The establishment of the German Empire's aspiration threatened many countries near Germany, especially France, which bordered Germany, and the small countries in Central Europe that had good friendships with France. After the establishment of the Rome-Berlin Axis, the fascist forces flourished outwards, and the crisis in Europe deepened as a result. The first reaction of the European democratic countries to the fascist forces was the Four-Power Pact in 1934, which attempted to reach a compromise with the aggressors. Due to the excessive ambitions and demands of the fascist countries, the so-called "Four-Power Pact" ultimately failed. For example, Germany demanded free movement in Central Europe, and Italy wanted a special sphere of influence in the Mediterranean and North Africa. All these facts illustrate that France was busy dealing with disputes in Central Europe and North Africa. The Saar incident, the German dispute, the demise of Abyssinia, the annexation of Austria, and the sacrifice of Czechoslovakia, all these bloody historical traces indicate France's inability to act in Europe.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the crisis in Europe also increased unprecedentedly. The momentum of the fascist attack on Spain was also particularly fierce. Czechoslovakia was also suffering disasters during this period. Therefore, we can notice that the development of the Sino-Japanese War is progressing and increasing simultaneously with the crisis in Europe. At the end of 1938, France needed to concentrate all its attention on the security issues in the areas bordering Germany, Italy, and Spain. These facts explain why France was unable to advise on the Far East. At the same time, although France understood that the culprit of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese imperialism, was an ally of German-Italian fascism, and that the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese War was enough to increase the threat to the security of Annam, France was already a little overwhelmed in Europe, so it was unable to advise on even the imminent issue of Annam's national defense. This is a fact. The Annam government deeply understood that South Annam and China had common interests in the Far East. The Annam government and the people have unanimously understood that if Japan truly defeats China, then the fate of Annam will be very critical. This is why the Annamese sympathize with China's resistance against Japan and want to restore the title of "Chinese Uncle." Another thing worth mentioning is that it was not until the end of 1938 that Annam received a little help from France to strengthen its national defense. All the above reasons tell us why France has not been able to help China more until now.</p>
<p>In addition to the various factual reasons mentioned above, some political reasons must also be described here. After the dissolution of the French Popular Front, the fascist forces in France gradually became stronger. We know that in every country, fascist organizations and many sympathetic and conservative parties are inclined towards Japan. The Japanese also used the assistance of French fascists to establish a strict propaganda machine to anesthetize French public opinion. There are also political figures in France who were quite influenced by a certain famous politician of the former Chinese government (referring to Wang Jingwei - editor). He said: "China is a weak country, a country that lacks scientific and mechanized modern weapons, and it is naturally impossible to resist to the end. The best way out for China is to negotiate peace with Japan..." This kind of defeatist argument caused a very bad reaction in French political circles. They thought: "If China itself does not have the confidence to defeat Japan, then what is the point of France helping China, except to provoke Japan's hostility in vain?" In addition, the international situation is so bad, and France's ability to help is very limited. If it is just futile and fruitless, it is better to be "on good terms with both sides." Since Jingwei was expelled from the party, the attitude of French political circles should have greatly improved.</p>
<p>In fact, the vast majority of French public opinion has always sympathized with China. To be more specific, all progressive left-wing political parties and most mass organizations fully support China. Of course, if this enthusiasm of the masses based on justice can be continuously reported to them with more deeds of China's heroic resistance against Japan, I believe that this sympathy will be infinitely expanded and strengthened.</p>
<p>Another thing that we must know is that Japan is the country with the most smuggling techniques in the world. Now they have applied various smuggling techniques to propaganda work. On the one hand, they propagandize how barbaric China is, and on the other hand, they promote how Japan is fighting for Sino-Japanese friendship and Far Eastern peace. However, we fully understand that this explanation is just a self-deceiving trick and has no factual basis. Everyone in France knows that the Japanese propaganda work is just to cover up their crimes of massacring civilians and bombing undefended cities in China. At the same time, they also know that the so-called "friendship" in the mouths of the Japanese only allows Japan to be China's "only friend." In other words, "The Far East is the Far East of the Far Easterners, and Japan is the only master of the Far East." However, China does not need such propaganda as Japan. Her best propaganda tool is the fact of the War of Resistance against Japan for the past eighteen months. It is by no means an exaggeration to say that China's long-term resistance against Japan has gained excellent diplomatic advantages internationally. The public opinion of sympathy for China among the majority of people in the world will promote all democratic countries to assist China with more human resources. France's Da Dong policy and its diplomatic attitude will naturally gradually become more active and inclined towards China.</p>
<p>The French government now has to understand that Japan's strength is not enough to conquer China. The development of the Sino-Japanese War is only increasing the damage to foreigners' interests in the Far East. Economically speaking, Japan has already begun to invade Annam. France's attempt to maintain friendship with Japan is tantamount to dreaming. In the past, the so-called "economic cooperation" of the Japanese in North China has now begun in Annam. The Annam government has tried several times to eliminate Japanese spies within its territory. This is also a fact. The French government originally thought that maintaining friendly relations with Japan was the best way to protect Annam. However, the performance of the facts has ruthlessly shattered France's dream. When the Czech incident deteriorated very much, and people all over the world were waiting for the guns of the Second World War to break out, several Japanese warships had already begun to cruise in the area between Weizhou Island and Paracelo Island, approaching Annam's coastline. If the war in Europe breaks out, I believe that Japan will immediately land in Annam. Now Japan is blatantly attacking Hainan Island. This fact should make the French government realize that the only way to protect Annam and maintain the Nine-Power Treaty is to help China resist Japan and overthrow the common enemy —— ×××××.

Approximately 1,000 × soldiers, including infantry and cavalry, with seven or eight cannons, launched a fierce attack on our Qilin, and the forward positions of Shengrenling yesterday. Our officers and soldiers fought to the death to resist, engaging in a bloody battle throughout the day for the control of personnel and horses. At the same time, a certain army responding to reinforcements launched an attack on Yanmenkou. The number of × increased to 2,000, with more than ten cannons and ten tanks.

Approximately one division of ×, with more than 50 armored vehicles, is currently moving towards Jingshan from the Hanyi Road, and it is confirmed that they are preparing to launch a large-scale westward attack. We are waiting in strict formation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 3rd] The recent stirrings of × in central Hubei have been frustrated in all directions. Several attempts to cross the Yuekou River by force have failed, and as a result, the war on that front has become dormant. On the Jingzhong Road, our × is still engaged in fierce battles near Couqiao. Yesterday and today, more than 200 × soldiers were killed or injured. On the Hanyi Road, after × launched a fierce attack on us from Wamiaoji, we resisted at every step, and × also suffered heavy losses.

<p>[Central Fire Agency, Yichang, 3rd] The battle in central Hubei is now focused on the area north of the highway. The × × advancing along the Jingzhong Road have been fiercely attacked by our powerful troops for several consecutive days. As a result, most of the × on the Hanyi Road have been reinforced northward, traveling with heavy troops to pursue and suppress, and engaging in fierce battles with us in the area east of Sunqiao for several days. × also used aircraft to take turns bombing our positions and releasing a large amount of gas. Our soldiers fought to the death and fought back and forth with × five times, and the battle was fierce.</p>
<h3>More than 1,000 Puppet Troops in Soviet Territory Revolted, Guangdong × Troops Were Weak and Still Took a Defensive Posture, Fierce Fighting in Southwest Qiongdong County</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chongqing, 3rd] According to a Shanghai telegram report, more than 1,000 puppet troops under Chen Anyou revolted in Qingpu.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chongqing, 3rd] Guilin Electric, × recently increased the number of troops in Guangdong by two divisions, all of which are from the Taiwan Army. Five or six thousand troops have been added to Guangzhou, and the × airport near Guangzhou has also been expanded. × Although there is an attempt to commit crimes, its current military strength is still impossible. × On Hainan Island, cannons, tanks, and a lot of ammunition and poison gas have been transported from Yokohama. Fierce fighting is currently underway in the southwest of Qiongdong County.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chang'an City, 2nd] More than 1,000 × troops were added to Lishi, with eight cannons. A part of them committed crimes against Wuzhen in Liulin. We intercepted them at various strongholds between the Zhongli Highway, and our troops attacked Qiangfeng Cliff (south of Xuangang) on the 21st of last month to cover the road repairs ×, defeating ×, killing more than ten people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 2nd] A part of our cavalry attacked Libing Village between Yuanping Xuangang in northern Shanxi, broke through the fortress, and killed more than 20 ×. Forty-odd shipyard workers revolted. × also plans to advance on Jingyue County in separate routes, one from Taiyuan via Lingjinggou to the northwest, one from Xinkou via Anzigou Xiagou to the west, and one from Ningwu via Sanzhiju Shui Anzhen to the southwest, advancing separately. Our troops stationed in northwestern Shanxi are now taking strict surveillance of ×.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd] In the Changying battle in southern Henan this time, our army fought bravely and killed more than 1,000 ×, capturing a lot of × weapons, ammunition, documents, and military supplies. After inspection, it was found that there were two pieces of evidence that × used poison gas in the area: (1) A large number of gas bombs were captured, (2) × soldiers had a record of using poison gas on their bodies. Also, the backpacks of the × army were previously made of cowhide, but the backpacks obtained this time were made of foreign cloth, and the ammunition was all "manufactured in June of the 10th year of Showa," which proves the lack of × supplies and the emptiness of the × army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 3rd] A certain brigade of our army, in coordination with the guerrillas, besieged Taikang City from the 25th of last month, and × was extremely panicked. Many pseudo-troops escaped or revolted in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, 3rd] The × troops entrenched along the railway north of Matang Station, after being constantly raided by our guerrillas, are now extremely panicked, not only dare not come out at night, but also secretly hide during the day.

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Peiping, 3rd] According to investigations, there have been no major battles in the area between Jinpu Road, Donglonghai Road, and the Yangtze River for the past 18 months. Only a few Japanese troops have been reported to be transported through. According to the announcement by the Japanese Army and Navy authorities last Wednesday, naval forces were dispatched to jointly advance to the area, attempting to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas. The Japanese army landed in Shanhai in the eastern part of Longhai, and at the same time, contacted other troops transported along the road and attacked the destination. × Air Force also dispatched to assist in the battle. It is said that Huaiyin on the Grand Canal has been lost.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 3rd] The × army at the river mouth has crossed the river for several consecutive days and constructed fortifications near Jun Sanshui. Most of them withdrew to the river mouth at night. The constructed fortifications are often destroyed by our guerrillas.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 3rd] The × at Taipingchang in Conghua have set up barbed wire everywhere, and forced the local people to dismantle and transport bricks and tiles to Zhujiuling to build fortifications. The × in Xinma, Huaxian, are conscripting men from various villages to form road teams with weapons, but the villagers are all carrying weapons to join the guerrillas to kill ×.</p>

<h3>Dock Workers in Various Countries Fight for Justice and Righteousness, Unanimously Refuse to Transport Iron to Japan</h3>
<p>Australia</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement recently received a report from Sydney stating that 3,500 dock workers at the Australian Banna Port were fired by the Iron Factory Poshan Company for refusing to load scrap iron to Japan on November 12 last year. All parties expressed their sympathy for their sacrifice for righteousness. The Australian Seafarers' Federation specially appealed to its members to pay one shilling each week to be used for Christmas shopping for the Banna dock workers. The New South Wales Labor also convened a conference, broadcast by radio, and distributed leaflets, supporting the actions of the workers. However, as a result, the trade union and the radio station were banned. The telegram of approval for the actions of the Banna workers issued by the Seafarers' Association was also inspected by the postal and telecommunications authorities. It is said that the banning of trade union radio stations and the inspection of telegrams sent to Banna were all measures taken by the Postmaster General, Mr. Cass, without prior warning procedures or seeking the opinions of government officials, which aroused protests from all aspects of Australia. Both the Duke of Scotland and the Tasman Sea, as well as the Bishop of Armada, the former President of the South Wales Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement, Anderson, the President of the International Comrades Association, the President of the Civil Liberties Association, and the former President of the South Yu Teachers United Association, as well as members of the government and opposition parties, and 78 union associations, unanimously criticized Mr. Cass. The Australian press also spoke out for justice. The Conservative Party's newspaper Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Herald and Times Weekly, Melbourne Times, and Sydney Daily Telegraph all criticized Mr. Cass. For a time, the public was in an uproar. As a result, Prime Minister Li Yongshi of the Federal Cabinet, after discussing with the Labor Party leader Fulong, unsealed the trade union radio station, and the authorities published an apology in the newspaper. Now the trade union radio station has been restored to freedom and continues to support the righteous actions of the Banna Port workers.</p>
<p>Vancouver</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The China Branch of the Anti-Aggression Movement recently received news from the General Assembly stating that 2,000 tons of scrap iron originally prepared for shipment to Japan are currently stopped at the Nanmo Port on Vancouver Island. As a result of the fierce protests of the city's residents, it failed to go ahead. The citizens divided into teams to go to the dock to advise the workers to transport the exhibited iron back to the warehouse. The drivers have accepted their advice and declared in public that they will never again transport scrap iron to Japan. The Vancouver Island Workers' Association has now set up a voluntary committee to prevent future shipments of scrap iron to Japan.</p>
<h3>Observer Talks About British Far Eastern Policy, Will Become More Active</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to a London telegram, after the House of Lords and the House of Commons discussed the Far Eastern situation, the commentators believed that up to now, the British government has been dealing with the actions taken by Japan in the Far East with diplomatic resistance. If a more active policy is adopted, the time is not far away. The United Kingdom holds economic weapons that can be used at any time. Once its interests in the Far East are seriously threatened, it should take a large-scale offensive in the economic field to maintain them. In other words, it should effectively resist Japanese goods in all parts of the British Empire. It is expected that this pressure will increase with the completion of the military expansion plan.</p>
<h3>Third Country Ships Interfered by ×, Ordered to Leave the Estuary of the Sheyang River in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Shanghai News, × The naval authorities announced on the 2nd that the Japanese Navy has decided to take certain actions in the Sheyang River area of the Province, so × issued a notice to all parties, notifying all third-country ships currently staying in the area or operating in the area that they must retreat from the mouth of the Sheyang River to a location 40 miles away from the mouth of the river before sunrise on March 4. The Japanese Navy will not be responsible for any damage suffered by third-country ships due to failure to retreat.</p>
<h3>× Blockade of Tianjin Concession Traffic, Consuls of Three Countries Protest, Rioters Commit Murders and Police Officers Injured in French Concession, Shanghai Public Works Bureau Issues Reply</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tianjin News, A watchman police officer in Majiakou, French Concession, was attacked and injured by rioters on the night of the 1st, and the pistol he was carrying was also taken away. After committing the crime, the rioters fled to the Japanese Concession, which is another proof of the × disruption of the Concession.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 3rd] The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have erected electrified defenses outside the British and French Concessions. The Consuls General of the United Kingdom and France in the area have lodged strong verbal protests with the Japanese side. The US Consul General has also lodged a similar protest.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 3rd] The Shanghai Public Works Bureau today replied to the Japanese side's request to suppress terrorists in the Concession. This reply has been carefully considered. Well-informed sources said that the incident has come to an end. It is learned that the Public Works Bureau and the Japanese authorities discussed for 70 minutes. The Public Works Bureau believes that third countries cannot exercise police power in the Concession, but with regard to the suppression of terrorists, the Concession police authorities welcome the Japanese side's cooperative assistance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 3rd] According to Japanese sources, the Japanese side has now reached a compromise with the Public Works Bureau, deciding on four matters: (1) The Public Works Bureau will make efforts to implement the emergency security law and hand over terrorists to the Japanese side. (2) The Public Works Bureau and the Japanese side will cooperate closely to protect the lives and property of the Japanese and prevent terrorist incidents. (3) The Public Works Bureau should step up the search of pedestrians at key points of intersection to prevent bad elements from entering the Concession. (4) Increase the number of Japanese patrols in each police station.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Report at the National Political Council on Developing the Resources of the Western Regions (Part 5 of the March Political Report)</h3>
<p>Economic Facilities</p>
<p>Regarding economic work, we continue to promote it according to the established policy of developing resources and increasing production. The relevant departments have separate detailed reports on the progress. Here, I will briefly explain a few points related to the government's major policies:</p>
<p>First, the past development of industry in our country has failed to proceed according to plan. It has neither taken into account the needs of national defense and military affairs nor paid attention to the natural resources of various regions. This is indeed a waste in the construction process. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, the government has tried its best to avoid this shortcoming. Now, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has moved factories from major coastal and riverside cities to the interior to start operations and has also established new industries. Future development must not be left to nature; it must be carried out according to plan. The government, after considering the resources and transportation of the southwestern provinces, has decided to make the Tuo River and Min River areas of Sichuan the first phase of industrial development areas. In this area, there are coal mines in Wei County, as well as kerosene and gas in Qi Huan County. According to expert research, these are all very promising. Alcohol factories, power plants, and chemical plants have already been established in the area. Paper mills and cement plants are being planned. Regional economic planning is an innovation in our country. Fortunately, experts are in charge of this matter, and its success is expected.</p>
<p>Second, the cooperation between state-owned and private enterprises is also a very important and complex issue. Under the Three Principles of the People, we will naturally try to regulate capital and prevent a few capitalists from monopolizing the market and controlling finance. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy and the strengthening of government banks, concerns about private control of finance can be said to be gone. Major means of transportation have long been nationalized, and large mining areas, especially those related to national defense industries and heavy industries, have also been designated as state-owned mining areas. Concerns about private monopolies of the market have also been reduced. In our underdeveloped industrial country, the scope of both state-owned and private enterprises is very large. However, if the scope is not clearly defined or if the government changes its policies frequently, private capital will not dare to forge ahead. Therefore, the government has recently paid special attention to issues such as the revision of the Company Law, the encouragement of private enterprises, and the cooperation between government and business.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Regime in Beiping Controls Foreign Trade, Forcibly Purchases Foreign Exchange from Exporters, and Imposes Strict Controls on Cotton Exports</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beiping, 3rd] The puppet regime in Beiping officially announced today that it will implement control over import and export trade from March 11th. Anyone exporting goods must hold a "Foreign Exchange Sales Certificate" and must sell the foreign exchange to the puppet "Central Reserve Bank" at a price of one shilling and two pence per puppet currency. Only those holding this certificate can obtain customs clearance. All goods transported to South China and Central China are subject to restrictions. However, when transporting goods to Japan and "Manchukuo", the exchange rate is two puppet currency units to one Japanese yen. The controlled goods are as follows: eggs and egg products, walnuts, peanuts, peanut oil, tobacco, macaroni, coal, wool carpets and cotton tablecloths, straw mats, flour, and salt. Cotton is not on the list, but the Japanese side has separately established control measures for cotton. The above control measures apply to all ports north of Qingdao. When asked about the control measures for imported goods, the spokesperson replied that the puppet government authorities will use the profits from the foreign exchange earned from converted exports to support imported goods.</p>
<h3>More Than Seven Hundred Casualties in the Osaka Explosion</h3>
<p>Refugees Gather Between Osaka and Kyoto - Victims of Militaristic Policies</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] According to Japanese news agencies, the Osaka police department has announced the number of casualties in yesterday's explosion at the Osaka vehicle depot. There were sixteen deaths, one hundred and fifty-one missing, and five hundred and nineteen injured, including one hundred and thirty seriously injured. As for military casualties, the Osaka Garrison Command announced that six soldiers were killed, two were missing, and fifty were injured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Osaka report: After the arsenal caught fire and exploded at 2:40 PM yesterday, a large infantry unit, an engineering team, and one thousand police officers worked together to put out the fire, which was finally extinguished late last night. As a result, 800 houses were burned down nearby, and 100 were half-destroyed. The nearby villages and towns originally had 5,950 houses and a population of 27,150. When the fire broke out yesterday, there was a risk that the villages and towns would be completely reduced to scorched earth. Fifty minutes after the fire started (i.e., at 3:30 PM), residents were immediately ordered to evacuate quickly. People fled to other safe locations. According to police statistics this morning, there are already 8,313 refugees in Osaka and 813 refugees in Kyoto. The military power between Kyoto and Osaka was restored this morning. The power plant in the explosion zone was also restored at 1:15 this morning. It is said that the cause of the explosion was that a worker in the arsenal was filling explosives into bomb casings but accidentally dropped the bomb into the explosives, causing it to explode. The guards and workers in the depot immediately tried to put out the fire, but the fire spread very widely, burning and destroying all parts of the depot one by one. All the injured have been sent to army hospitals in Osaka and other places, as well as the Red Cross Hospital, for treatment. The army authorities have specially distributed 3,000 cotton blankets and 30,000 food rations to the refugees in Osaka.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Osaka telegram: The fire in the × army arsenal was extinguished this morning. The damage is as follows: 10 dead, 32 seriously injured, 440 slightly injured, 36 missing. 800 houses were completely burned, and 100 were partially burned. There are more than 8,000 refugees, including 7,500 in Osaka Prefecture and 813 in Kyoto Prefecture.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Tokyo dispatch: Japanese anti-war organizations have been expanding recently. Although military and police authorities have tried their best to search for them, their secret activities have become even more active. At 3:00 PM on the 1st of this month, when the Osaka arsenal suddenly exploded, the fire spread very fiercely. Most of the nearby barracks and houses were burned down, and there were many military and civilian casualties. The police stationed in the area tried their best to put out the fire, but the losses were very heavy. After a large number of personnel were dispatched from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for investigation, it was learned that the fire was caused by arson by members of an anti-war group.</p>
<h3>Japanese Anti-War Movement, Riots in Kwantung, Opposition to Warlord Conscription</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Anti-war sentiment in × country has spread throughout the country. On the afternoon of the 17th of last month, fierce riots broke out in Nanbu-cho and Otsubo, Kwantung, due to conscription. Villagers gathered crowds and set fires everywhere. More than 300 houses were burned down. The riots were suppressed by a large number of police.</p>
<h3>× Planes Cheer Up the People of Changde</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Changde City is located on the left bank of the Yuan River, and its situation is quite similar to Xiangtan. However, the slight difference is that there are no residents on the opposite bank of the Xiang River in Xiangtan, while there are still some houses on the opposite bank of the Yuan River in Changde.</p>
<p>Changde is a famous commercial port in western Hunan. All the products transported from the Yuan River basin and the Xiangqian Highway (a section of the Jingdian Highway) are concentrated here and then loaded onto ships to travel from Dongting to Changsha, Yueyang, Hankou, and other places. Although after the Xiangqian Railway is completed and opened to traffic, its prosperous position in commerce may be largely taken away by its sister—Xiangtan. Its importance in defending Sichuan and Guizhou will not be diminished because of this.</p>
<p>There are two main streets in the city, paved with wide and flat stone slabs, which set off the shops built in a combination of Chinese and Western styles on both sides, fully demonstrating the vigorous style unique to cities near the mountains. The population of the entire county is as high as 1.2 to 1.3 million, making it one of the four largest counties in Hunan in terms of population. However, according to Zhu Maoqi, the secretary of the county government, the population in the city used to be only 30,000. After the War of Resistance, it "increased daily." Until the evacuation from Wuhan, it once surged to 80,000 to 90,000. Later, because × planes often came to pay their respects three times and nine bows, they were actively evacuated to 20,000 people.</p>
<p>The × planes came to wreak havoc. They first bombed three times outside the city and four times inside the city. The bombs they dropped were random and unmarked, just like the silly son-in-law in the children's story who boiled eggs in the river water, throwing one and it sank, without even an echo. This is not an exaggeration. In fact, many unexploded bombs that they dropped on the county government (it is ridiculous that × planes only know how to pay their respects to the county government and send gifts whenever they come to the mainland) and other places are still displayed there like groups of living treasures for people to admire.</p>
<p>However, the × planes did not hesitate to use bombs made from the flesh and blood of the Japanese people, consuming them again and again in the same place. Unfortunately, Changde has recently suffered from its poisonous hands once! Because the air raid alarm lasted too long, the citizens thought that the × planes would not come to "patronize" and returned home from the air raid shelters and the suburbs. Unexpectedly, the cunning and brutal × planes suddenly descended from the sky and bombed the houses, using machine guns to strafe the fleeing crowds. For a time, blood and flesh flew everywhere, and cries shook the wilderness. More than 600 innocent civilians were killed or injured. Especially the blood and corpses in a certain place in Fenchen were in patches, and their density was similar to the tragic scene when × planes secretly bombed the three major companies on Nanjing Road during the August 13th War in Shanghai!</p>
<p>In the county-owned Yumuzhen, there are more than 500 households. Dozens of incendiary bombs were dropped, burning three-fifths of the houses, but no residents were killed or injured, which can be said to be fortunate!</p>
<p>Secretary Zhu also said: China's long-term War of Resistance has a special condition that no other country can match, that is, the land for resistance cannot be bombed out, and the people for resistance cannot be bombed out. Taking Changde as an example, after each tragic bombing, as long as the government provides some relief, it can be restored to its original state. Many people here have never experienced such a long and large-scale war before. They often move back and forth: this time they have supported more than ten months of the War of Resistance. The people have probably contributed all their strength, which can be considered "utmost benevolence and righteousness," right? In other words, they should "sell their swords and buy cattle" to prepare for a peaceful year! Sometimes, when the county government issues a notice to recruit porters, it is regarded as a formality. When young students perform new dramas to encourage donations, they are regarded as tricks to watch for free. However, every time they are bombed by × planes for no reason, their blood will boil once. Whether it is donating money to defend the country, enlisting for work, or donating materials to comfort the wounded, they will respond enthusiastically. They have also realized from the lessons of blood the meaning of the deep-seated connection that we will never be able to have a day of peace until the × people are driven out of our country. The × people vainly try to threaten our rear with bombing, but the result is that the bombing only increases our animosity.</p>
<p>Moreover, western Hunan has a rugged terrain, and the Dongting ports are crisscrossed. The people's enthusiasm for resistance is high, and the self-defense teams are strongly organized. The × bandits entrenched in northern Hunan are obviously on a dead end if they attempt to invade westward along Dongting with their current limited forces. But "there is much in the belly of ××," and they know it themselves. Therefore, they have been shrinking their feet in Yueyang, not daring to overstep the thunder pond for more than three months, and the reason lies in this. However, recently our guerrillas have launched a fierce attack on Yueyang City, and have established opportunistic contact with the regular army, constantly approaching Xitang, Matang, Taolin, and other places in eastern Yueyang, attacking their backs and stabbing their heads, and trying to cut off their rear traffic. We can retreat a step and say that even if the × people can still hold on to a corner in northern Hunan for a short period of time in the future, they will never be able to become a monster threatening western Hunan. Therefore, the current problem in western Hunan lies not only in the threat from the × people but also in the internal paralysis, which will be described in the following communication.</p>
<h3>× Next Year's Budget Exceeds Nine Billion, Public Debt Reaches Approximately 7.8 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese government has already decided that the supplementary budget for temporary military expenses for the year from February this year will be 4.6 billion yuan, of which 3.92 billion yuan will be financed by public debt. Adding the general budget of 3.69 billion yuan and the supplementary budget for land and naval relations in the 14th year of Showa of 770 million yuan, the total will be 8.96 billion yuan. Assuming that the government will submit a supplementary budget for general accounting of over 100 million yuan to the parliament, the total budget for the 14th year of Showa will be over 9 billion yuan. The government plans to issue public bonds, and the estimated amount of public bonds issued in the supplementary budget for general accounting to be decided will reach over 7.8 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>British Government Proceeds with Rebuilding Friendship with the Soviet Union, Sends Sir William Seeds to Moscow to Negotiate a British-Soviet Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The British government is proceeding with re-establishing friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The importance of this result indicates a new trend in British policy, as Chamberlain's policy of appeasement towards Germany and Italy has failed to produce the desired effect. Relations between Britain and the Soviet Union cooled in the early stages of the Spanish Civil War. After Germany annexed Austria and before Czechoslovakia was invaded, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov appealed to the European democracies to unite with the Soviet Union to jointly oppose the aggressors, but received no response. During the Munich Crisis, the Soviet Union was completely ignored. Members of the British House of Commons often raised questions about ignoring the Soviet Union. Now, the British government has dispatched Sir William Seeds to Moscow to hold trade negotiations with the Soviet Union on the 23rd of this month. It is believed that the results of these discussions may lead to the establishment of a British-Soviet trade agreement, which is also related to Britain's commercial policy towards Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>British Army and Air Force Budgets Greatly Increased</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon will submit a new budget to the House of Commons next month, totaling £125 million, an unprecedented record for peacetime. The government has already designated £35 million of this amount to be raised by issuing national defense bonds, so the burden on taxpayers can be reduced to £90 million. Even if there are slight discrepancies, it will certainly not exceed the current budget of £94.5 million. Therefore, income tax in 1939 may not increase. The Air Force budget will be announced today, and the total military expenditure will probably reach approximately £51.6 million. However, the total national defense expenditure for next year (including civil defense expenditure) will be in the range of £58 million. Government expenditure will be £58.5 million, which can be reduced to £44.5 million if all items that can be offset by self-collection are excluded. In addition, there is an additional £10 million for additional government expenditure. Adding this amount to the £23 million for debt interest, the total budget will reach £126.5 million.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] According to the 1939-1940 Air Ministry budget announced here today, the total amount is £226.26 million, an increase of £86.223 million over the previous year, of which £14.2 million depends on borrowing. The budget is accompanied by a memorandum from Air Minister Wood, which recommends increasing the number of air personnel to 118,000, an increase of 22,000 over last year. By the end of 1939-1940, Britain's first-line aircraft will total 1,750, which is exactly in line with the plan proposed in 1936. Of the total expenses, approximately £124 million is used to request technical equipment and vehicles, compared to only £78 million last year. Aircraft and balloons account for £93 million of this amount. Civil defense expenditures will increase from £3 million to £5 million.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] The new British Army budget for 1939 is £161,133,000, an increase of £46,714,000 over the previous year. At the same time, the number of troops has also increased by 15,700 compared to before. The number of British troops will then be 185,700, assigned to various units.</p>
<h3>Cardinal Pacelli Elected Pope, Coronation Ceremony to be Held on the 12th, France and the United States Welcome, Italy and Germany Dissatisfied</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 3rd] Cardinal Pacelli has been elected Pope, to be known as Pius XII. The news of his election was announced by Dom Moneani. Pacelli was formerly the Secretary of State of the late Pope. After being elected, he stepped onto the balcony and was greeted by a large crowd in the square cheering "Long live the Pope." Military and police maintained order, keeping them several steps away from St. Peter's Basilica, but some accidents also occurred. In the crowd, some women fell, and were carried back by the crowd. The new Pope then performed the first purification prayer. The crowd cheered enthusiastically. After the new Pope entered from the balcony, the bells rang and the lights in the square were lit. The crowd began to disperse. A total of sixty-two cardinals participated in the election, and Pacelli was elected as the new Pope on the third ballot.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 3rd] The new Pope will hold a formal coronation ceremony on the 12th of this month, and then leave the Vatican for the Basilica to receive the Church's foundation. The actual number of votes for the election is not yet known, but it is known that most people enthusiastically voted for Pacelli as the new Pope. This morning, the new Pope gave a broadcast address to the world's Catholics, calling on all countries to work together for peace, justice, and humanity. The Pope spoke in Latin for four and a half minutes, his voice steady and very moving. After the speech, the Pope broadcast a prayer and sang a Latin hymn.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Chairman Lin of the National Government sent a telegram of congratulations on the election of Cardinal Pacelli as Pope. The text read, "To His Holiness Pope Pacelli of the Vatican, I am delighted to hear of your election and, on behalf of the National Government and the people of the entire country, extend my sincere congratulations. I hope you will accept this, Lin Sen."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] Political circles here are quite surprised by the election of former Vatican Secretary of State Pacelli as Pope. The general opinion is that the Vatican will not elect a Pope with political inclinations. It is also said that the new Pope is quite active in politics, often handling state affairs, and that his name, Pius VII, indicates a continuation of the policies of the former Pope Pius XI, especially that he will maintain close relations with dictatorial countries. Therefore, people in political circles are not yet commenting on the inclinations of the new Vatican.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Vatican City, 3rd] According to sources here, the new Pope, Pacelli, is currently drafting a plan to resolve the conflict between the Church and Germany. The new Pope's policy will follow in the footsteps of the former Pope, with only slight changes. Because the new Pope has traveled to North and South America twice, he will definitely pay special attention to relations with the American countries. It is believed that the new Pope will make efforts to improve the difficult church affairs in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Mexico.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] The election of Bishop Pacelli as the new Pope is greatly welcomed in France. Pacelli has many friends in France. His resolute nature and skill in dealing with difficult issues are generally welcomed. The election of the former Pope's Secretary of State as Pope is most unusual. It is believed that this indicates that the former Pope's independent policy will continue to be implemented. At a time when the Church is in difficulty, it needs someone who is familiar with international affairs to come forward and lead. The new Pope has always been regarded as the Church's best diplomat, and his frequent election is indeed suitable. Political figures believe that he is an anti-fascist, and his election as Pope is a disadvantage for Mussolini.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The new Pope of Rome, Pacelli, has traveled to the United States and gained the friendship of people in Washington. His election is very popular. It is believed that at a time when the Church in Spain, Germany, and Austria has many serious problems to be solved, Pacelli's diplomatic talents are truly needed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 2nd] The people of Rome especially welcome the election of Bishop Pacelli as Pope because Pacelli was born in Rome. The International Daily recently wrote that it seemed quite difficult for Pacelli to obtain the votes of the Italian cardinals, so whether Pacelli's election will be completely satisfactory to the Fascists is doubtful. It is believed that Pacelli received almost the legal number of votes (two-thirds) in the first election.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 3rd] Pacelli's frequent election as the new Pope has caused a strong attack here. Officials regard him as the anti-Nazi driving force of the Vatican.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd] German officials were quite surprised by Pacelli's frequent election as Pope. A German spokesperson said that it was unexpected that the cardinals had elected someone engaged in political life as Pope, which shows that the Catholic Church has a strong political color in this election of a Pope, which may be the only way to solve the national crisis. Cardinal Pacelli served as the Vatican's ambassador to the German state of Bavaria in 1917 and was transferred to the German ambassador in 1920. Pacelli also participated in the negotiation of the church agreement between the Vatican and the German government in 1918. Later, he was promoted to Secretary of State and presided over various negotiations with Germany. The organs of the National Socialist Party criticized him severely.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 2nd] The people of Spain are very satisfied with the election of the new Pope. The new Pope is familiar with international politics, and his rich international political experience is truly reliable at a time when the Church and politics are closely related.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Competition Between France and Italy: Italy Calls Up Reserves; French Press Satisfied with Polish Attitude</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] According to the Italian official news agency, foreign journalists in Italy believe that a new crisis will erupt in Europe. The central issue is the competition between France and Italy for influence in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, Italian newspapers criticize Britain for planning a commercial "attack" on Franco-controlled Spain. Mussolini has also instructed various newspapers to attack France, indicating that the appropriate time for making demands is imminent. Furthermore, Italians express disappointment with the communique from the Italian-Polish talks, as Ciano was unable to secure any concessions from Polish Foreign Minister Beck.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 3rd] The Italian government yesterday issued a decree ordering reservists from the 1915 to 1918 classes to report for duty. This call-up will affect between 60,000 and 200,000 people. Official sources say that the issuance of this call-up order is a routine matter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] Reports of Italian army mobilization have been denied by diplomatic circles here. The Italian recruits being called up are only from the 1938 and 1939 classes, who are untrained. These recruits are traditionally called up in April, but this year they have been called up early, in March. In addition, a portion of reservists from the 1915 and 1916 classes have also been called up. In short, while there are causes for concern regarding news from Italy, there is no need to be overly alarmed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd] The French press is highly satisfied with Poland's attitude, considering Poland to be a friendly nation to France. This was fully demonstrated during the recent talks between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. If Poland were to adopt a consistent stance with Germany and Italy, Germany and Italy would have no worries about their rear, and France would feel directly threatened by Germany. The current attitude adopted by Poland prevents France from feeling this threat.</p>
<h3>Renowned British Archaeologist Carter Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] British archaeologist Howard Carter passed away here last night at the age of sixty-five. He famously discovered and excavated the tomb of Egyptian King Tutankhamun in 1922, together with the late Lord Carnarvon.</p>
<h3>United States Designates One Thousand Factories for Munitions Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chicago, USA, 2nd] Mr. Johnson recently delivered a speech to the local Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Department of the Army has designated one thousand factories across the country to engage in the production of various munitions when necessary. At the same time, he advised managers of aircraft factories to relocate their plants to areas less susceptible to air raids.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia to Finish Delivering Soviet Armaments; No Further Supply After May</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 3rd] According to reliable sources, Czechoslovakia had signed a contract with the Soviet Union before September last year to supply armaments. The contract expires on May 1st this year. Currently, Czech armaments factories are working day and night, aiming to complete the delivery of all armaments stipulated in the contract before May. Starting from May, Czechoslovakia will no longer supply armaments to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>US Department of Agriculture to Send Experts to Brazil</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] US Secretary of Agriculture Wallace recently announced that he had a second meeting with Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha regarding the issue of rubber production in Brazil. He stated that the US Department of Agriculture will send an expert to Brazil to assist the country in the development of agricultural products that do not compete with US products.</p>
<h3>Former US Ambassador to Germany Causes Accident; Injures Mexican Girl; Fined $250</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Virginia, 3rd] Former US Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Dodd, injured a 14-year-old Mexican girl in a car accident today due to careless driving. He was ordered to pay medical expenses and a fine of $250.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoys Conferring in Germany; Talk of Military Alliance; London Unconvinced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] The News Chronicle reported yesterday that several Japanese envoys stationed abroad are scheduled to convene in Berlin today to finalize the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan (which has not yet been formally signed). The final agreement is expected to stipulate whether it should be directed not only against the Soviet Union but also against Britain, France, and even the United States. Japan has already implemented dangerous actions in China, and its future is unpredictable. Therefore, as a precaution, Japan has been actively working to establish an "iron front" to counter the Soviet Union and democratic countries. However, the European Axis powers are hesitant about whether to establish such an alliance. According to inquiries from various sources in London by Reuters, even if the Japanese envoys stationed abroad hold discussions in Berlin, it is unlikely to have a particularly significant impact. Furthermore, the Japanese ambassador to Britain and other relevant parties here are unaware of the alleged meeting of Japanese envoys in Germany. Ambassador Shigemitsu, currently in London, has no intention of traveling to Berlin. Shigemitsu holds a very important position in the Japanese diplomatic community. In Shigemitsu's absence, the meeting of Japanese envoys abroad is unlikely to discuss important diplomatic issues. The News Chronicle previously reported that three Japanese government officials traveled from Japan to Berlin at the end of last month to hold final consultations with relevant parties regarding the revision of the formal military alliance treaty. However, according to Japanese sources here, this trip by Japanese government officials is unrelated to what the newspaper reported. According to well-informed sources, it is not the first time that diplomats from the Axis powers of Germany and Italy have held meetings. At the same time, observers in London generally believe that regardless of the hopes harbored by the Axis powers of Germany and Italy (which are currently unknown), Japan is unwilling to bear any obligations regarding European disputes, as Japan's involvement would have more disadvantages than advantages.</p>
<h3>Franco Government to Join Anti-Comintern Pact; Soviet Press Criticizes British and French Recognition; Spanish Government Elects New President</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] The "Debate" newspaper recently received a report from Burgos stating that political circles there indicated that the Spanish government is about to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The newspaper criticized this report, stating that the entire world knows that Franco's policy is to oppose Bolshevism.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] The "Pravda" newspaper recently commented on Britain and France's recognition of the Spanish Franco government, its remarks representing the first reaction of the Soviet government to this matter. The newspaper stated that this move by Britain and France demonstrates that the brewing of a second imperialist war has entered a new stage. The purpose of the next great war is to sacrifice the interests of democratic countries and allow dictatorial countries to re-dominate the world. Britain and France's recognition of Franco is like a second Munich-style deal between them and fascist countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The British representative in Burgos, Mr. Hodsoll, has been appointed as the British Chargé d'Affaires in Spain. The Spanish Franco government has also appointed the Duke of Alba as the Spanish Chargé d'Affaires in Britain.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Athens, 3rd] The Greek government recently announced its decision to recognize the Spanish Franco government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Madrid, 3rd] The cabinet yesterday elected Martinez Barrio as the successor to Azaña as the president of the republican government.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Ship Charter Case; Japanese Merchant Loses Appeal</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Court of Appeal here today raised the question of "whether there is a war between China and Japan" when ruling on a case. In May of last year, Judge Goddard recognized that a state of war existed between China and Japan, and that ordinary merchants could use the word "war" without regard to the provisions of international law. The case arose when Beysheng Steamship Company refused to charter a ship to Kobe Kawasaki Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha in September 1937, even though the two parties had previously entered into a charter agreement. Judge Goddard ruled that Beysheng Steamship Company was not at fault, as the contract stipulated that "if war breaks out and Japan is involved, either party may terminate the contract." Kawasaki Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha appealed this ruling. Sir Cripps, representing Kawasaki Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha, argued that "the company's lawyers had received a reply from the British Foreign Office stating that the British government does not currently recognize that a state of war exists." The judgment stated that Judge Goddard's ruling was very reasonable, and that war could break out without the British government's recognition. Today, no one dares to say that there is no war without a declaration of war. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Standard Oil Representative Arrives in Mexico; Negotiations Unlikely to Succeed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Mexico City, 2nd] Standard Oil Company representative Mr. Ridgeley arrived here today to discuss with the Mexican government the issue arising from the expropriation of foreign oil properties, hoping to reach a solution as soon as possible. According to reliable sources, Mr. Ridgeley has also been entrusted by British interests. Pessimism prevails here regarding these negotiations, as it is believed that it will be difficult for both parties to reach a solution.</p>
<h3>Attempted Bombing of Birmingham Bridge</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] An attempt was made to blow up a canal bridge in Birmingham, England, in Wednesbury. The explosion occurred at midnight, with the sound of the blast startling people and audible for miles. After several hours of investigation, the location of the bomb explosion was found. The riverbank was damaged, but the crack was not large. Had the explosion succeeded, the surrounding countryside would have been flooded.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Official Mackensie to Arrive in China Soon for Disease Prevention Assistance Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 3rd] At the last League of Nations meeting, it was resolved to allocate 10,000 Swiss francs for League of Nations technical health assistance to China for disease prevention. Dr. Mackensie, a League of Nations official from Britain, is scheduled to fly to China soon to discuss the 1939 technical assistance plan for disease prevention with the Chinese side.</p>
<h3>Arab Proposals Difficult for Britain to Accept; Prospects for Compromise Grow Dimmer</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] After careful study of the new Arab proposals here, it has been discovered that the prospects for compromise are even dimmer, as the proposals continue to insist on their initial demands. The British government is unlikely to accept them. The proposals demand immediate independence for Palestine, with full Arab control, and oppose the British proposal to convene a round table conference, deeming it unnecessary and slow.</p>
<p>Short Comments</p>
<h3>Meeting on a Flagship</h3>
<p>Our newspaper received information that yesterday (3rd) at 10:30 AM, the British and Japanese sides continued negotiations on the British flagship HMS Kent regarding issues related to Hong Kong and South China. It is understood that General Tanaka, commander of the Japanese invasion of South China, will remain in Hong Kong until Sunday or Monday before returning to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>This news is bound to attract attention from all sides. What we can and must say is, first, to clearly recognize the circumstances under which this meeting is being held. Is it not taking place after the Japanese invasion and occupation of Hainan Island? Is it not taking place after the Japanese bombing of the Hong Kong border at Luohu? Is it not taking place after the Japanese launched an attempt to seize the Shanghai concessions? We have repeatedly pointed out the recent dangerous actions of the Japanese, and we have also repeatedly hinted at the current situation in Hong Kong. Since this meeting will discuss the conflict between Britain and Japan regarding Hong Kong and South China, we must first pay attention to whether the Japanese can unconditionally lift the siege of Hong Kong? Or is it limited to opening up some blockades? Or even attached to some conditions? This is something we cannot but be concerned about! Secondly, we hope that friends of our country will note that today, Hong Kong and Britain's position in China, their interests are completely aligned with the Chinese government and its people. We firmly believe that the British side will never recognize any demands that are contrary to the interests of China and the Chinese people. We also earnestly hope that righteous friends of our country will use the power of public opinion to launch a strong and united resistance against the aggressor's threat to Hong Kong and South China.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Rapprochement</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 2nd stated that British Prime Minister Chamberlain broke with precedent on the evening of the 1st by accepting an invitation from Soviet Ambassador Maisky and attending a banquet at the Soviet Embassy. This event has attracted attention from all sides.</p>
<p>Previously, the British government had decided to send a special trade envoy to Moscow, and preparations had been made to discuss a new Anglo-Soviet trade agreement. With this latest development, it is no wonder that Reuters explicitly stated that "this may be an indication that the British government is reconsidering its relationship with the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>We are somewhat aware that the aim of Soviet foreign policy is to maintain world peace and oppose all aggression, and that its recent call for "democratic and peaceful nations to unite" leaves no doubt as to the desirability of Anglo-Soviet rapprochement. As for the British side, if we were to assume that Chamberlain's action means that the British rulers are about to completely abandon their anti-Soviet policy, it would be premature. The recent recognition of the Western rebel government contradicts this trend. However, we should also be aware of the fact that the international fascist aggressors are further threatening democratic and peaceful countries, which on the one hand is arousing the antipathy of the British, French, and the world's working masses towards the appeasement policy, and on the other hand is increasing the faith of people of all countries in the Soviet government and the peace front. The British rulers cannot deny this fact. Moreover, today, Britain's national interests, both in Europe and the Far East, are consistent with those of the Soviet Union. Britain wants to maintain its position in Europe and the Far East, and cannot do so without the support of the Soviet Union. Therefore, we believe that the British government's reconsideration of its relations with the Soviet Union is not only necessary today, but also has the potential to happen. We earnestly hope that Anglo-Soviet relations will gradually develop anew, and that the democratic peace front will gradually be strengthened. This is not only the hope of the Chinese nation, but also the responsibility of all those who care about world peace to promote Anglo-Soviet friendship.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dong Ping</p>
<p>——The True Picture of the German-Italian Axis's Superficial Harmony</p>
<p>This article is extracted from the book "The Fate of the Danube Nations" (Danubian Destinations) by Graham Hutton, editor of "London Economics."</p>
<p>When ordinary people look at the two fascist giants, they often put Mussolini in the front, taking him to be the older brother. But the truth is far from it. Since the establishment of the German-Italian axis, Mussolini has really been completely reduced to a vassal of Hitler and forced to follow Hitler blindly. Not to mention that after Italy joined the German-Italian axis, she has lost Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary in just one year in 1938. Watching them roll into Germany's embrace one by one, but having no one to complain to. Now she hopes that Germany can repay her kindness and help her extort a sum of money from Britain and France to make up for her losses. But the extent to which Germany can help her is really a question. Italians have long been unhappy with Germany's anti-Semitic movement. They see that many rich Jewish merchants in Tunisia are forced to acquire French citizenship by the anti-Semitic tide. This is naturally a great loss of Italian wealth. In fact, even Mussolini himself does not approve of Hitler's indiscriminate anti-Semitism. A few years ago, Mussolini's finance minister was still a Jew, and he himself was a frequent customer of Jewish bookstores. However, he understands that his power is not enough to persuade his little brother.</p>
<p>The infighting between Germany and Italy can be clearly seen from the Czechoslovak-Hungarian dispute in mid-November last year. At that time, Germany had just won a supreme victory in Czechoslovakia. Hungary, seeing this, also followed Germany's example and demanded the Ruthenia region from Czechoslovakia. This area was originally Hungarian before the war, but became part of Czechoslovakia after the war. At that time, Hungary, backed by Italy, made a show of force against Czechoslovakia, determined to seize it. But it did not expect that Czechoslovakia, after being betrayed by Britain and France, simply leaned on Germany's side. So, Germany stepped forward to interfere in the Czechoslovak-Hungarian dispute. As a result, the Czechoslovak-Hungarian dispute really became a conversation between Germany and Italy. The result of that conversation was that Mussolini suffered another defeat. Ribbentrop still gave Ciano some face and promised to call Czechoslovakia to cede a part of Ruthenia to Hungary, so that Mussolini would not lose too much face.</p>
<p>After the end of this incident, Hungary's discomfort was naturally the same as Italy's. But what it was even more disappointed with was that its traditional protector, Italy, was also powerless to help. It never forgot that one day, it would be able to make Germany suffer a big loss in the same way, sincerely convincing Hungary of its allegiance. But today, it has no choice but to abandon Italy and seek Germany's protection.</p>
<p>Hungary's control by Germany can be seen from a very small incident. Not long ago, Hungarian Prime Minister Imrédy gave an interview to the "Daily Mail" in London. A famous newspaper in Budapest reprinted the interview, but was punished by being suspended for two weeks. This was because Berlin protested. Berlin protested because Imrédy's interview said that if Czechoslovakia went to war with Germany, Hungary would have to remain neutral. The implication is that Hitler would not allow Hungary to remain neutral, but wanted her to follow Germany into battle.</p>
<p>Completely identical to the story above is that of Spain's Franco. He also received a warning from Berlin and Rome for making an independent statement, asking him to reflect on himself and pay attention to his words and deeds. Otherwise, the German and Italian volunteer army would be prepared to withdraw, allowing the rebels to repeatedly suffer defeats.</p>
<p>The above is some of the political aspects. Now we can take a brief look at the author's observations on the economic aspects.</p>
<p>Most obviously, after Austria was annexed and Czechoslovakia was partitioned, Germany has taken over the lifeline of Central Europe in both political and economic terms. From now on, it is likely that everyone will have to follow her lead.</p>
<p>We should remember that Czechoslovakia was established after the Great War. She basically did not, and could not, have borne any war debts in the Great War. However, the peace conference decided that she should be responsible for repaying 12% of Austria's debts and 16% of Hungary's war debts. This is very funny, and now that a large area of Czechoslovakia has been slaughtered and the rich Sudetenland has also been separated, it is really unfair and beyond its barren strength to ask it to be responsible for repaying this debt. The most appropriate thing to do now should be for Germany and Hungary to be responsible for it separately, because only they gained the most in the Munich Conference.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, what should be raised is still Italy. So far, Italy has become a complete follower of Germany not only in political terms, but also in economic terms. It has lost most of its commercial transactions from Austria. Its northern key town of Trieste is also in a dangerous situation. The people there may soon become Germany's great customers.</p>
<p>Also, many Italian ports bordering the Adriatic Sea, such as Fiume, have seen a sharp decline in shipping and a decline in trade this year. These are what the fascist officials are quite anxious about. Mussolini also clearly understands that Hitler's indiscriminate actions are harmful and useless to Italy.</p>
<p>Finally, the author also made a detailed analysis of the general situation in Europe and made speculations and researches on all possible futures. To give an example, that is something that few people can foresee. He believes that Germany and Italy will definitely attack beautiful and peaceful Switzerland in the future. He exposed all the methods that the Nazis are using now to spread peace propaganda in an attempt to find a foothold in Switzerland. But because of the rise of Swiss patriotism, the Nazis failed and still cannot find even half a seat in the national elections. Hutton also concluded that even if Germany and Italy further attack Switzerland by force in the future, they will still not succeed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the future of Europe, the author advises Britain not to be discouraged (I'm afraid it's too late to say this - translator). He uses all the reasons he has to prove that if the German-Italian axis really starts a war, that is just his adventurous behavior. In this adventure, Germany is like in 1914, wanting to get a "quick victory", but that is the past hope. If the democratic countries can cooperate with it into a long-term battle, Germany and Italy are bound to lose.</p>
<p>Hitler's biggest mistake is his recent fiery anti-American movement, which has forced the British and Americans of the same race to join hands. The result of Germany's anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism has made the American people, who have always swept the snow in front of their own doors, fill their chests with righteous indignation. A former American minister to Europe said that in his decades of mixing in the diplomatic world, it was the first time he had seen Americans really angry with foreign countries. Also, a famous German newspaper in New York also frankly admitted when the German ambassador left the United States and returned to Germany that all of the Nazis' measures had completely destroyed the inherent friendship between Germany and the United States.</p>
<p>The author concludes in the book that Washington is a major pillar determining the future fate of Europe. If you think that the countries of Europe are all on Germany's chopping board and that they will all be dominated by Germany from now on, that is really wrong.</p>

It has been learned that the British and Japanese representatives held informal negotiations again yesterday on the HMS Kent, discussing the full opening of the Pearl River waterway and the general political situation in South China, as well as its impact on Hong Kong. The British representatives were Vice Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, Major General Gallasie, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in China, and Colonel Neville of the Army.

The negotiations between the two sides on the British warship yesterday included the full opening of the Pearl River waterway and the general political situation in South China, as well as its impact on Hong Kong. The results are not officially announced. According to a certain source, the results were not significant. It has been learned that Tanaka's stay in Hong Kong has now been extended again and will probably only leave Hong Kong and return to Guangzhou on Sunday or next Monday. Regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Luohu incident, the amount of compensation has not yet reached a decision stage. Regarding this matter, the reporter visited Auxiliary Secretary Smythe yesterday morning. According to his response, the lives and deaths of those injured in Luohu are still uncertain, and the consolation of the families of the deceased is also under investigation. Therefore, the amount of compensation has not yet been finalized, and so on.</p>
<h3>Liaison Association of All Circles Decides to End Relief Work in the New Territories; Yesterday's General Meeting Decided to Write to the Relief Group to Handle the Aftermath; 500 National Currency Allocated to Relieve Refugees from Conghua</h3>
<p>After Shenzhen was bombed, more than 3,000 refugees from the unified refugee camp organized by the Liaison Association were relocated back to the New Territories, stranded around Fanling and Man Kam To. The Hong Kong government authorities specially appointed the Emergency Refugee Relief Committee to be responsible for relief work. Therefore, the Liaison Association had to announce its closure. This matter was decided at the 37th general meeting yesterday afternoon. Representatives attending yesterday's general meeting included Li Jianfeng from the Journalists Association, Lao Mian Nong and Lin Peisheng from Tung Wah Hospital, Liu Qingxuan from the Women's War Relief Association, Huang Zhaoruolan from the Young Women's Christian Association, Xiong Maozhao from the Women's New Movement Association, Lu Guomian from the Chung Sing Charitable Society, and Xing Chi from the Sun Wui Commercial Association. Chairman Li Jianfeng first had Recorder Shi Bohan read out the minutes of the previous general meeting and the memorial preparation meeting, followed by reports from each group on their work. Regarding the request from the New Territories refugees for the Liaison Association Relief Group to continue to manage relief affairs, the Relief Group reported that personnel from the New Territories Refugee Relief Office personally met with Chief Medical Officer Situ Yongjue on the 27th to discuss everything, and it was decided to stop providing relief in the New Territories. It was immediately discussed and decided that the Relief Group's relief work in the New Territories would end. Regarding how to proceed with the aftermath work, it was also decided to send a letter to the Relief Group to inquire and then make a decision. The discussion then continued on other proposals. 1. The Conghua Refugee Relief Association sent a letter reporting the severity of the disaster and requesting assistance, and it was resolved to allocate 500 national currency. 2. Regiment Commander Lü Guozhi of the New 234th Regiment of the ××× requested an allocation of funds to provide comfort to the families of fallen soldiers, and it was resolved to postpone the matter. (4) Chen Yi, commander of the Anhui Self-Defense Corps, was hospitalized in Hong Kong due to a gunshot wound to the chest and requested assistance to return to the team to supervise resistance against ×, and it was resolved to send him back to his place of origin. (5) The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Guard Corps has completed the examination and is about to depart, and it was resolved to allocate 400 national currency. As for medical supplies, they were requested to prepare a list and submit it to the Association for purchase on their behalf. (6) Regarding the request from all staff of the Shenzhen refugee camp for each person to be given 10 Hong Kong dollars as travel expenses, it was resolved to give 10 dollars to salaried employees and a medal to non-salaried employees as a memento, and to hand it over to the standing committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Governor of Hong Kong Visited Kwong Wah Hospital Yesterday, Expressing Satisfaction with the Hospital's Facilities</h3>
<p>His Excellency Sir Geoffrey Northcote, the Governor of Hong Kong, visited Kwong Wah Hospital in Kowloon yesterday morning at 11:00. The chairman of the board, Zhou Zhao Wu, directors Lao Mian Nong, Yang Yongkang, Lin Peisheng, and others gathered at the hospital to await him. Sir Robert Ho Tung, the senior Chinese representative, Colonial Secretary of Chinese Affairs, Mr. Caine, Director of Medical Services, Dr. Situ Yongjue, and others arrived one after another. At 11:30, the Governor arrived at the hospital by car with his aide-de-camp, and shook hands with Sir Robert Ho Tung and the directors, exchanging greetings. He was then led by the chairman and directors of the hospital to inspect the wards. The details are as follows: After the Governor arrived, the directors accompanied him in the lobby, chatting briefly. The chairman then walked alongside him to inspect the hospital, starting from the patient reception room to the right of the lobby, then to the operating room, the Western medicine pharmacy, and then to the women's ward and other rooms. When the Governor arrived at the Chinese and Western medicine consultation area, there were many male and female patients seeking medical advice, and the order was well-maintained, which the Governor praised. From the consultation area, they went upstairs to the self-care rooms, and then visited the Western doctors' dormitory. The Governor praised the dormitory for its unique style, ample light, and good air circulation, making it suitable for doctors to live in. The Governor then went to the convalescent hospital for inspection, comforting the patients, and then went to inspect the garden tents. After comforting the patients in the tents, he returned to the front of the hospital lobby, took photos with the gentlemen, and then bid farewell.</p>
<h3>Human-Headed Strange Goat Found in the New Territories; Died the Same Night After Birth</h3>
<p>Police Constable No. 340 of the Tai Po Police Station in the New Territories owned a goat weighing over 40 pounds. The goat gave birth to a cub at 1:00 PM. The shape was strange, with only two legs and a human-like head. The police constable's colleagues were amazed. Both the goat and the cub died last night.</p>
<h3>Saving-the-Nation Actress Ms. Jin Suqin Arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai This Afternoon; Theatrical and Women's Circles are Preparing to Welcome Her</h3>
<p>Ms. Jin Suqin, a Peking opera star known for her skills in both singing and acting, has been famous in North and Central China. In recent years, she has been determined to improve Peking opera. She co-founded the China Drama Troupe in Shanghai with playwright Ouyang Yuqian and performed Ouyang's "Liang Hongyu." On the day of the performance, the Southern City was retreating, and the situation was extremely tense. Later, she performed saving-the-nation Peking operas such as "The Peach Blossom Fan" and "The Fisherman's Regret" in Shanghai, which were hated by the ×× people. As a result, Ouyang Yuqian was forced to leave Shanghai, and Ms. Jin was also forced to leave the stage. Now, unwilling to be confined to the isolated island for a long time, she took the President Cleveland ship from Shanghai on the 2nd to Hong Kong to engage in improved Peking opera and saving-the-nation drama movements. The ship is expected to arrive at 5:00 PM today. More than ten drama groups, including the Hong Kong China Art Drama Troupe, and women's groups have sent representatives to the pier to welcome her. It is said that Ms. Jin plans to perform charity performances to raise funds for Hong Kong charitable organizations to provide relief to refugees, in addition to performing improved Peking opera.</p>
<h3>Kinshan Maru Returned to Hong Kong Yesterday, with 200 Passengers</h3>
<p>The Kinshan Maru, which went to Guangzhou a few days ago, returned to Hong Kong at 3:30 PM yesterday, carrying a total of 190 Chinese and Western passengers, mostly Chinese. Among them were about 40 people from the Wuchang Hanli. (Note: The Wuchang Maru transported relief medicines and food to Guangzhou in December last year and has not yet returned to Hong Kong.) Deng Zongyao, the former director of the Guangzhou Telephone Bureau, was also among the passengers. According to the passengers, Chinese passengers had to obtain exit permits from the Japanese Consulate for this voyage. After the Kinshan Maru departed at 8:00, when it arrived near the Humen Fort, the × army sent a motorboat to pick up the pilot. It was discovered that five passengers did not have exit permits, so they were detained and taken to Humen by small boat. (Please refer to the South China News column of today's newspaper.)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Authorities Build New Refugee Camp in San Uk Ling; Can Accommodate 2,000 Refugees, Limited to Women and Children; Now Accepting Refugees and Providing Food and Clothing</h3>
<p>The × aircraft frantically bombed civilian buildings in Shenzhen, causing severe damage and turning them into ruins. Tens of thousands of refugees fled to the New Territories. The Hong Kong government authorities designated the Chinese and Western Emergency Relief Committee to be responsible for relief, and at the same time opened the train cars at the North and South Stations of Fanling and various refugee camps such as Cha Keng for accommodation. The number of people accommodated reached 6,000. The number of people accommodated by various refugee houses in Hong Kong and Kowloon also exceeded 3,000. The Hong Kong authorities are actively carrying out relief work for these refugees. Recently, a new refugee camp has been built on land allocated in San Uk Ling, Man Kam To, in the New Territories. The camp area is very large and can accommodate about 2,000 people.</p>
<p>Camp Construction</p>
<p>Construction of the camp began last Saturday and was partially completed by this Wednesday (1st). From that day on, refugees wandering in the wilderness requested to be accommodated in the camp. At that time, due to the lack of facilities in the camp and the lack of order in management, it was impossible to provide meals for the refugees in a hurry. Only a place to stay was provided to prevent them from sleeping in the mountains. Until last month, the authorities sent many doctors and managers to the new camp to arrange and handle all the work in the camp, and at the same time provided the refugees with food and clothing. The purpose of the government in building this camp is to temporarily accommodate</p>
<p>Refugee Homes</p>
<p>Therefore, accommodation is limited to women and children. As for adult men, they are ordered to return to Shenzhen during the day to work, but because the situation in Shenzhen is not completely stable, they are allowed to return to the camp at night to sleep, but no meals are provided. According to a person in charge of the Emergency Relief Committee, after Shenzhen was bombed, refugees were displaced in the border area of the New Territories. The government originally intended to reopen Yau Sang Company to accommodate refugees, but because the current situation in Shenzhen is not stable and people are panicked, the idea was abandoned. Therefore, there is a move to build another refugee camp near Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Fanling Area</p>
<p>There are currently about 2,800 refugees in Fanling. A school for refugee children has been opened since the day before yesterday, with four teachers in charge of teaching. More than 200 people have enrolled. The Cha Keng camp accommodates about 600 people and is managed by the Red Cross. Some of the refugees here also escaped from Shenzhen. The Kam Tin refugee camp currently has 2,600 refugees and the situation is very good. The planned land reclamation and handicraft work from the previous month has been actively promoted and has achieved considerable results.</p>
<h3>Pig and Chicken Prices Rise After × Invasion of Hainan; Supply Source Reduced, Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>Since the × invasion of Hainan Island, the supply of meat in Hong Kong, such as chicken and pigs, has been greatly reduced. Demand exceeds supply, so prices have soared. Live hogs have increased from 24 yuan to 32 yuan per picul, and chicken prices have also doubled per catty. If there is no other source of supply, the possibility of continued price increases exists. Those engaged in the above business are now trying their best to find solutions.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Signs Agreement with My Resources Committee for Exclusive Rights to Tungsten Ore Purchase and Sale in Hong Kong; Total Transaction Value Exceeds 4 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>It was previously rumored that a certain British merchant firm in Peiping had signed an agreement with my government's Resources Committee to purchase all of the tungsten ore stored in Hong Kong. According to investigations, it has been substantially confirmed. It is said that the total transaction is valued at 4 million yuan. The Resources Committee has granted the merchant firm exclusive agency rights to sell tungsten ore in Hong Kong. The merchant firm is a long-established British firm, and its principal is Mr. Beattie, who currently resides in London. He has many rights and interests in railways in the occupied areas and estimates that he has considerable rights in the Kailuan Coal Mine. It is verified that most of the world's tungsten ore supply comes from China. Since the outbreak of the war, most of this trade has been concentrated in Hong Kong. Even after the × people's southern invasion, the source has not been cut off. There are 25 tons waiting to be sold, which can be shipped at any time. The Resources Committee's control is not effective. The source of this ore amounts to as much as 300 tons per month. The × people publicly stated in August last year that they would actively seize my tungsten mines. Therefore, this incident has attracted considerable attention. In Hong Kong, the most intense competitor with British merchants in the tungsten ore trade is the German government's agent firm. With the success of this purchase by the British merchant, the contract between the German trading company and China regarding tungsten ore and tung oil is bound to be terminated.</p>

<h3>Where Do Educated Youths Go?</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Life Bookstore Recruits Four Trainees, More Than 600 Applicants</p>
<p>In a capitalist society, "knowledge" has become a cheap commodity. It is not easy for educated youths to get rid of the troubles of the times, and it is inevitable to add fuel to the fire and worry on top of worry.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Life Bookstore published an advertisement recruiting four trainees. Many people may not even know about this; but as of yesterday, there were 620 applicants, an astonishing number!</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. Gan Junyuan, the manager of Life Bookstore, for telling the reporter the details of this recruitment of trainees. The reporter could not help but shudder while listening!</p>
<p>Before Guangzhou fell in August last year, Life Bookstore also published an advertisement recruiting trainees. There were only a few dozen applicants, and the results were very mediocre. As a result, none were hired. This time, there were 620 applicants at once. According to the self-introductions in the application forms and letters, the results are not only many times better than the recruitment last year, but almost comparable to the results of recruitment in Shanghai.</p>
<p>This fact is enough to show that what used to be called " now is actually full of the footprints of "cultural people."</p>
<p>What kind of treatment is it that makes people flock to it?</p>
<p>It turns out that this time only four trainees are recruited. In addition to providing food and lodging, the monthly salary is eight Hong Kong dollars. If the service is excellent and they are promoted to staff, the monthly salary can be more than twenty Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Of course, many of the young people applying this time are here because they are enthusiastic about serving culture; but those who are driven by the "iron whip of life" are also not a few. So, how to choose four people out of 620? The method is to select the 50 best performers based on their forms and letters as the initial selection; and then set the examination for tomorrow (5th) at the YMCA. The subjects include Chinese, general knowledge, abacus and oral examination. In order to accurately and fairly select the four people to be hired. Mr. Gan also solemnly stated that the type of person the store hopes for, in addition to the general conditions of having confidence in culture and being able to serve conscientiously, must also be a young person around 20 years old, innocent and lively. Because those who are experienced in society often have too deep-seated prejudices, and their heads are full of dross, making it difficult to change and clean up. Although young people are "naive" and have little "experience," they are eager to learn and easy to improve. Based on previous experience, the reporter also deeply smiled understandingly at Mr. Gan's attitude towards employing people.</p>
<p>The reporter asked if there were any incidents of "introductions" and "pleading" in this recruitment? Mr. Gan replied: Yes, there are, but very few. Anyone who does not rely on their own ability but asks someone to plead will definitely not be hired. However, it is very welcome to introduce the life and personality of the applicant as a reference for hiring.</p>
<p>What is the situation of these 620 people?</p>
<p>It can be said that 90% are unemployed, out-of-school refugee educated youths. More than half are teachers who have fled. Among these 620 people, there are 40 people applying from Macau. Female applicants also account for a number of 70 or 80. In terms of education, there are quite a few high school students and university students, but because there is an age limit of 25 years old, most are still junior high school graduates. The results of university students and high school students are not necessarily stronger than those of junior high school students. Perhaps it is because circumstances determine their true achievements. Although it is not possible to accurately distinguish the differences before the re-examination, according to Mr. Gan, the person whose results are outstanding and whose past work attitude is most sympathetic is a 19-year-old junior high school graduate who works as a boy in the Ai Qun Hotel. After Guangzhou fell, he wandered to Hong Kong. The reporter looked at the form he filled out, and the calligraphy was extremely beautiful. In the photo, he also looked like a handsome young man. It immediately made the reporter think of those pampered young masters who did not have a drop of ink, and made people feel an infinite sense of regret!</p>
<p>After the re-examination on the 5th, after all, only four people will be able to realize the reverie in their minds, truly step into the threshold of the Life Bookstore, make close friends with "books" and "readers", and have a living to look forward to, and what about the other 616 people?</p>
<p>Lovely and respectable young people: Return to the embrace of the motherland! Whether it is the front line or the rear, everywhere is waiting for outstanding and enthusiastic young people to reclaim and sow, don't hesitate to worry here! Stand up straight, head towards the victorious future, and return to the embrace of the motherland!</p>
<h3>Flying Hotel Boeing Clipper No. 1; Maiden Voyage Arrived Safely in Hong Kong; Meticulously Designed and Splendidly Decorated, Ushering in a New Era in Aviation; Honeymoon Room is Particularly Interesting, Love Chair is Especially Soul-Capturing</h3>
<p>The long-awaited Pan American Airlines' Boeing Clipper No. 1 departed from Manila at 7:39 AM yesterday and flew to Hong Kong. The weather was bad, and it did not arrive in Hong Kong until 1:00 PM. It circled Hong Kong and Kowloon for a week, and at 1:10 PM, it landed at Kai Tak Airport, completing the 11,000-mile journey. About 2,000 people waited at the Kai Tak Airport pier to admire the true face of this world's largest aircraft. The aircraft slowly descended and parked beside the pontoon bridge. The 12 crew members and 12 technical experts on board appeared one after another amid cheers. Kai Tak Airport Manager Moss stepped forward and shook hands with Chief Pilot Guda, congratulating him on his success. Chief Pilot Guda told the welcomers that the flight was perfect and averaged 165 miles per hour. He was very satisfied with the aircraft. Later, experts specially sent by the company boarded the aircraft to carefully inspect the work of the aircraft for future reference. At 2:45 PM, Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote of Hong Kong boarded the aircraft for a tour at the invitation of Pan American Airlines. Only 250 other social figures were invited to visit. According to the person in charge of the company, the aircraft will travel between Hong Kong and the United States in the future, and there will be many opportunities for those who want to visit the interior of this giant aircraft.</p>
<p>Magnificent and Splendid; Unparalleled in the Air</p>
<p>The construction cost of the aircraft reached US$1 million (approximately HK$3.4 million). When fully loaded, it weighs 41.5 tons. The internal volume is equivalent to a house with five rooms and a basement. The floor area is 4,000 square feet, and the wingspan is 152 feet from tip to tip. It is twice the size of the Hong Kong Clipper. It can carry 74 passengers during the day and 34 passengers at night. It can fly 6,500 miles at an altitude of 20,000 feet. The maximum speed is 200 miles per hour, and the normal cruising speed is 186 miles per hour. The aircraft is equipped with an air conditioner, and its heating is sufficient for five houses with seven rooms each. The temperature inside the aircraft is consistently 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The interior of the fuselage is divided into two levels, with 18 rooms, all covered with luxurious carpets and comfortable velvet sofas. The meticulous design and novel style make it a flying hotel.</p>
<p>More Passengers on Short Flights</p>
<p>Visitors first arrived at a wide standing area in the upper plane, below which was a fuel tank with a capacity of 1,500 gallons. They then passed through the side door to reach the passenger room. After descending three steps from the room, they arrived at the dining room. Except for the cockpit, the dining room is the largest of all the rooms, 12 feet long and 10.5 feet wide. The various configurations in the room are brightly colored and eye-catching. Both sides of the room have hinged windows, and the curtains are Venetian-style. The style of the curtains in other rooms is also the same. There are five chests inside, made of black walnut wood. There are also 14 luxurious dining chairs. When the aircraft is making a long ocean voyage, because the passengers are not at full capacity, the dining room can be opened at any time as the center of communication for passengers. If it is a short flight, it can also be converted into passenger seats, which can also carry 14 more passengers.</p>
<p>Aristocratic Equipment Available</p>
<p>There are doors at the front and rear of the room, leading directly to the passenger cabins. The equipment in each room is the same, only the colors are different. Each room can accommodate ten passengers. There are two chairs on the starboard side, facing each other, each seating three people. There are also two chairs on the port side, but only two people can be seated. There is a "bridge table" in the middle of the chairs. Every evening, each room is suddenly transformed into a bedroom. Each bed has a deep blue curtain unique to Pan American hanging down. The sheets and other items are batch-dyed in light blue. The three-seater is converted into two beds, crossing the interior of the aircraft. The other two are parallel to the length of the fuselage. Each bed has an outer window, a personal air circulation machine, a bedside lamp, a call bell for the waiter, a clothes rack and other equipment. Continuing towards the tail of the aircraft is a room on the port side that can accommodate four passengers. The door on the left side of the room is opposite the women's dressing room. Inside, there is a white porcelain wash basin with hot and cold water taps, and other women's make-up equipment is also complete.</p>
<p>Honeymoon Room with Love Chair</p>
<p>The rearmost end of the aircraft is the location of the "honeymoon room." The color scheme of the room is the same as that of the dining room, and the furniture is mostly light blue. There is a "love chair" next to the window on the starboard side. Next to it on the wall is a three-seater sofa that can be converted into a bed at night. In one corner of the opposite room, there is a desk that can be used for both makeup and writing. In the other corner of the room, there is an automatically opening and closing washstand. There is also a chair and a coffee table. At the front of the aircraft, there is the largest passenger room, which can carry ten passengers. Further ahead on the port side is the bar, and on the starboard side is the men's dressing room. In addition to the liquor cabinet, the bar also has an air-conditioning box and a steam table. Crossing this place, there is another passenger room. Both ends of the aircraft have "ice rooms." The meticulous design is a model for civil aviation aircraft.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Guests Arrived to Visit</p>
<p>Pan American Airlines invited officials such as Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote of Hong Kong to visit, and also sent invitations to Chinese and Western business circles. Visitors were divided into two time periods, 3:30 PM and 4:30 PM. After the Governor finished visiting the aircraft at noon, the personnel in the aircraft began to refuel in preparation for leaving Hong Kong for the Philippines this morning and returning to the United States. It was not until 4:05 PM that Chinese and Western guests were allowed to enter the aircraft. The company also limited 20 people each time to avoid overcrowding and difficult viewing inside the aircraft. The aircraft was parked at the end of the Kai Tak beach, outside the company's newly built floating platform. Guests could enter the aircraft without the need for a boat crossing, which was very convenient. It is said that guests were only allowed to visit the seats, living room, kitchen, honeymoon room, and toilets inside the aircraft. As for the important parts of the engine room, they were not open to the public.</p>
<h3>Soviet Icebreaker Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday from Singapore; Going to the Arctic Circle for Exploration</h3>
<p>The Soviet icebreaker Shagen Nu Wo Zhi set off from the Soviet Union to the Arctic Circle and has arrived in Singapore. Yesterday, it sailed north from there and will soon pass through Hong Kong. It is verified that the ship can break through 12-foot-thick snow layers and has a speed of 8 nautical miles per hour. There are about 150 crew members on board, as well as one female doctor and five female shipworkers. According to the shipowner, each person on board must stay in the Arctic Circle for about four months each year, so the internal equipment is particularly appropriate, with several bedrooms and special heating equipment. The dining hall is exceptionally spacious, and the reading room is rarely seen in ordinary non-passenger ships. A grand piano is provided, and there is also a piano room, which is a symbol of the Russian people's love of music. The shipowner is Wei Gelief, who met the late British explorer Sir Shackleton in Akansha.</p>
<h3>Spring Autumn Racing Last Day - Jockey Club Especially Welcomes Children - Free Admission with Parents - Races Start at 2 PM with a Total of Nine Races</h3>
<p>It is said that old Hong Kongers call today "The King of Horse Racing." Originally, there was only one Chinese horse championship race, usually scheduled for the last day of the Spring Grand Racing Meet. However, nowadays, things have changed somewhat. "Da Jia Wang" (Big Frame King) race is run on the fourth day, with "Nusi Yili" taking first place. Also, the "Australian Horse King" and "Zhi Chou Wang" (Ticket King) races are run today. In my humble opinion, shouldn't today be called Children's Day? According to the Spring Racing Meet, which lasts for five days, the first day can be called "Virgin Day," based on several maiden races. The Derby new horses, Australian new horses, and Ticket new horses all make their debut on this day, each contributing their virgin works. The second day, needless to say, everyone knows it is the day of the Derby Championship final. The third day can also be called "Australian Derby Day." The fourth day is "Good Women's Day." On this day, a special Women's Purse race is held, and the jockey who rides the winning horse receives a valuable purse, along with a beautiful woman to accompany him for lunch. This lucky jockey is, of course, very honored, and the beautiful woman is selected from the local Hong Kong Shu Yuan, becoming the center of attention. For the first four days, horse racing can be said to be unrelated to children. The Jockey Club's advertisements clearly state that children are prohibited from entering. Only today is the attitude changed, and the gate is opened exceptionally, especially welcoming children. Children who love horse racing can come with their parents, and the Jockey Club will not charge a single penny. However, children should know that if they leave their parents and run around alone, the Jockey Club will still refuse them entry. Speaking of the horse races themselves, today the horses will be saddled at 1:30 PM, and the races will start promptly at 2:00 PM, with a total of nine races. The Australian Championship and Ticket Horse Championship finals can be said to be only related to the horse owners. Those who love to gamble on lottery tickets may not be so happy because, no matter how many horses run, in reality, only two are competing against each other. The former is "Leqi Lie" against "Lankai Xia Jiesi," and the latter is "Maishi Wen" against "Silu Disida." No matter which one you bet on, the payout will be small. In addition, the Ticket new horses that have not yet won are divided into two groups to race again. The first group has a total of thirty-three horses, all of which are mediocre and evenly matched. In the second group, with a total of thirty-two horses, the first place should belong to "Zha Da Boshi" or "Tai Ni Tian," but "Lie Da" or "Qi Mi Gu" or "Mei Li Er" should not be underestimated. "Fei Ci Ya Li Ke Shi" and "Ni Shun Nu Anna" are improving day by day and have a good chance of winning. The Australian Class C old horses and new horses that have not won will have a mixed race, about five furlongs. Among the new horses, the fastest starter is "Di Wang Ni Yan," and the rest are enemies for the old horses. The Chinese Class C horse handicap race, one mile and 171 yards, seems to be a triangular battle between "Tan Ba Bi," "Jing Tu Lie," and "Nusi Zhen." The Yu Wei Spring Handicap is also one mile and 171 yards. In the first group, "Jing Shi He Dun" will definitely win and have no rivals. The second group, however, recommends "Tai" as the top pick. "Bo Lie Han," "Jin Wenshi Wen Bei," "Ge Sha Biao Di," and "Zha Shi Yan Tai" are all carrying 167 pounds, which is a bit too heavy.</p>

<h3>Jinshan Ship from Guangzhou Passengers Talk about × Navy and Army - Our Brave Air Force Launches Powerful Bombing of Baiyun Airport for Days - Guangzhou's Implementation of Martial Law is to Prevent Our Guerrilla Raids</h3>
<p>The Jinshan ship of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Shipping Company left Hong Kong for Guangzhou on the 28th of last month, stayed in the province for two days, and left the province yesterday morning to return to Hong Kong, arriving at noon. The ship carried only over a hundred Chinese and Western passengers and no cargo. After the ship arrived in Hong Kong, reporters boarded the ship to investigate and learned from the passengers about the situation in Guangzhou in detail, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guangzhou × Army Declares Martial Law</p>
<p>It is noted that the Jinshan ship had previously traveled to the province once. After returning to Hong Kong, it resumed the Hong Kong-Macao route. Later, the shipping company negotiated with the Guangzhou × authorities on temporary resumption conditions and left Hong Kong for the province again on the 28th of last month, arriving in Guangzhou in the afternoon. After berthing for two days, it carried 187 passengers back to Hong Kong yesterday morning at 8:45, including 35 British and 152 Chinese, with no cargo. According to the ship's staff, the voyage was originally scheduled to depart at 8:00 yesterday morning. However, the × Navy sent four armed inspectors to board the ship and search the passengers' luggage, so it was delayed for 45 minutes before setting sail at 8:45. It is noted that among the passengers, more than 100 first-class tickets were sold out. Among them, the Westerners were all staff of foreign merchants in Shamian, and the rest were staff of the Taikoo Shipping Company in the province. Another part were members of the Lian boat crew hired on the Wuchang ship, which transported food to Guangzhou for relief a few days ago. There were very few other passengers. When asked about the recent situation in Guangzhou, they said that they did not dare to go ashore due to the advice of the Guangdong Customs officials, so they had no way of knowing. They only knew that Guangzhou had been under a state of emergency for several days.</p>
<p>Brave Air Force Bombs Guangzhou</p>
<p>Then, when inquiring with the passengers, according to them, the reason for the declaration of martial law in Guangzhou in recent days was that the × army planned to open an airport in Baiyun Ke Lu, which had been raided by our brave air force for days. It was also said that, in addition to bombing the Baiyun Mountain × airport, our air force passed through the urban area but did not drop bombs. Currently, the Guangzhou market is still deserted, and very few have been forced to resume business, only daily necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, salt, and grocery stores. As for the Henan area, our guerrillas are extremely active, and at the same time, the × side also has heavy troops stationed here, fearing the containment of our guerrillas, so they are forced to do so. Also, there are frequent conflicts between the × Navy and Army in Guangzhou. All residents of Guangzhou are forced by the × Army to wear a "Good People Certificate," but as soon as they reach the Navy's area, they are torn up by the × Navy and subjected to insults and beatings. This alone is enough to see the discord between the × Navy and Army.</p>
<h3>Report of Reclaiming Nan'ao Not Verified - News between Shantou and Nan'ao Still Isolated - × Aircraft Fiercely Attack Shantou, Chao'an and Other Places</h3>
<p>[Shantou Express News] Last month, × Aircraft × 窰 (kiln) stalked Chaoshan, and on the first day of this month, more aircraft were sent to bomb Shantou City and Yixi in Chao'an, and that night they re-occupied Nan'ao, carrying out burning and killing. Although Shantou City is slightly tense under the threat of × people, the people's hearts are stable, and the market is as usual. The authorities are engaged in preventing Han traitors and are stepping up efforts to maintain law and order. The details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>News Interrupted Between Shantou and Nan'ao</p>
<p>After more than a hundred × soldiers re-occupied Nan'ao on the evening of the 1st, they plundered westward and sent teams directly to Houzhai. Our army held fast in the Longhuan mountainous area. Most of the residents of Nan'ao County retreated with the defending army. Fierce fighting broke out on the morning of the 2nd. It is widely rumored here that our self-defense forces have recaptured Nan'ao and driven the × people back. However, news between Shantou and Nan'ao is interrupted, and it is difficult to verify the accuracy.</p>
<p>× Aircraft Attack Shantou Five Times and Drop Bombs</p>
<p>On the morning of the 1st, multiple × aircraft entered Shantou City via Chenghai Nanhai at eight o'clock and circled for half an hour. At 9:12, they fled to Batou, Chenghai, and then folded back into the city at 9:18, dropping four bombs at Chetou. At 9:35, they flew towards Chao'an via Caitang and peered at Heyang, passing Fengshun. It is estimated that of the four bombs dropped at the railway station, one hit the workers' quarters, one hit the railway tracks, and one landed in an open space. The train evaded in advance, and the passengers were evacuated in a hurry, avoiding injury. At 10:30, another × aircraft was discovered in Fengshun, passing Yekeng and entering Xingning, turning to Jieyang. At 11:55, another air raid alert was issued in the city. The aircraft entered the city via Guankou, Chaoyang, and flew low over the city to observe. At about 12 o'clock, the aircraft flew southeast, and the alert was lifted.</p>
<p>Fierce Attack on Chao'an and Spying on Various Affiliated Areas</p>
<p>According to military intelligence, from 1:00 to 2:00 on the same day, × aircraft were also discovered spying in Heyuan, Anliu, and Fengshun. At 1:30, an × aircraft was discovered in Chenghai Beihai, flying towards the city. The city issued an air raid alert. After the × aircraft entered the city, it circled over the railway station again and then peered at Chao'an via Anbu, dropping a bomb at Chao'an Railway Station, then passing Yixi. At the same time, another aircraft entered Chao'an from overseas via the city, dropping another bomb at the station, peering at Yixi, and dropping a bomb at Yixi Station. Then, two more bombs were dropped at Chao'an Station. At 2:20, the aircraft flew south and escaped via Beihai. At around 3:00, another × aircraft entered the city, flew into Cai and flew to Chao'an, dropping three bombs at Chao'an Station. Then, it flew towards Jieyang via Fengkou, circling over Shangjieyang, passing Puning and Liu Miao, and re-attacking the city via Chaoyang. At 4:55, it left via Nanhai.</p>
<p>× Warships Appear and Disappear, and Our Side Strictly Guards Against Them</p>
<p>Statistics show that air raid alerts were issued five times in various places in Chaoshan on the 1st. × aircraft dropped dozens of bombs, but our side was prepared, and most of the women and children had been evacuated, so there were very few casualties. As for the destroyed houses, the authorities have sent personnel to clear them. Currently, there are × warships appearing and disappearing in Chenghai Beihai, Haifeng, and Majiao. Our military authorities have issued a warning and will resolutely fight back if × invades.</p>
<h3>All Salt Ships in Shanwei Port Burned by × Army</h3>
<p>There were seven large salt ships parked in Shanwei Port. These salt ships have always been used to transport salt from Shanwei to Guangzhou. However, since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, × warships have often appeared and disappeared on the sea in that area, and they bombard salt ships and fishing boats as soon as they encounter them. Therefore, the salt ships did not dare to sail out and had been moored in Shanwei Port for a long time. On the 28th of last month, × warships suddenly drove several speedboats into the port and set fire to the seven large salt ships parked there. The crew members fled one after another. Whether there were any deaths or injuries is not yet known. Yesterday, a salt ship crew member fled to Hong Kong. According to his account, the situation was very tragic. It is noted that each of these salt ships is worth tens of thousands of dollars, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Civil Affairs Department Refreshes Police Administration - Orders Mai Qilin to Draft a Rectification Plan -</h3>
<p>[Wengyuan Express News] Li Hanshun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, believes that police officers have the special responsibility of preventing harm and maintaining local law and order. At this extraordinary time, the duties of officers are even more important and should be strengthened. In particular, police officers are in close contact with the people day and night. If they are competent, the local area will be peaceful. If they are incompetent, they will harm and disturb the people. It is now found that among police officers at all levels in the province, there are indeed many who cherish themselves, work hard, and serve the public, but there are also a few who are ignorant of their responsibilities and engage in bribery and private gain. Some falsely report the number of police officers and embezzle salaries. Some collude with local bullies to deceive the villagers. Some protect opium, gambling, and prostitution and accept illegal regulations. Some accept private criminal cases and illegally abuse their power. Some embezzle fines for violations of regulations. There are various malpractices. Therefore, Mai Qilin, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Civil Affairs Department, is ordered to draft a plan to rectify the police administration and implement it conscientiously. From now on, police officers at all levels should strive to reverse accumulated bad habits, be vigilant, strictly abide by laws and regulations, and faithfully perform their duties, step up wartime training to adapt to environmental needs. If anyone dares to repeat their previous mistakes and disregard the rules, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Shipping Special Report</h3>
<p>Changxing Company's Russian Garden Queen is in dry dock undergoing repairs that have been underway for many days. The repairs are nearly complete. It is scheduled to sail to the Kowloon cargo hold bridge at 8:00 AM on the 6th of this month and will depart for Shanghai, Japan, Honolulu, and Vancouver at noon on the 8th of this month.</p>

<p>The Jardine Matheson ship arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning from Europe via Shidou. The ship carried more than 400 people to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Except for a few who landed in Hong Kong, the rest took the original ship to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Since the Jinshan ship went to the province, the Taishan ship of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Shipping Company has changed its time from Macau to Hong Kong to 2:30 PM every day.</p>
<h3>Returning from the Pingshan Guerrilla Area （）</h3>
<p>— Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>— Shadow of the People's Guerrilla Team of Huiyang —</p>
<p>Mourning the Broken and Majestic Trenches</p>
<p>× Aircraft have bombed Pingshan many times, but without causing any damage. However, they have not come these two days. Today we were chatting under the sparse forest when we suddenly heard cannon fire, followed by the announcement of an enemy air raid, but in the end, nothing happened. So we went to the outskirts to observe.</p>
<p>Pingshan is an important place between Huiyang and Bao'an, close to Dapeng Bay. Therefore, before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in Guangdong, the Moxide troops stationed in the area pre-built many important fortifications. As we passed through the fields and hills, we saw very solid and well-organized structures with many trenches that made good use of the terrain. Facing the rice paddies and overlooking the dangerous cliffs and deep caves, deep trenches were built in the dense forests. If there were good firearms to rely on for defense, it would not be easy for × people to attack.</p>
<p>These trenches stretched for more than 20 miles and could not be defended without a significant force. At the same time, in every important terrain, there were strong machine gun positions. The situation was very dangerous. A completely steel and concrete underground chamber was used by officers for combat command during wartime. Another winding passage from the hillside to the bottom of the mountain led to a machine gun chamber. Its solidity, secrecy, and majesty were amazing.</p>
<p>However, like a fleeting dream, these fortifications, which cost a lot of manpower and material resources, were not used at all when the × people attacked because, in the opinion of the garrison troops, the × people would only attack from the southeast. Who knew that the × people would occupy Pingshan with a four-sided encirclement and attack? As a result, the garrison troops were attacked from both sides and retreated in defeat.</p>
<p>We slowly trampled among the broken and majestic trenches all over the mountains and plains and couldn't help but mourn in silence. An atmosphere of sigh and sorrow was thick. The facts of past defeats are a profound lesson for us. We can only learn from these tragic defeats to strive for greater victories in the future.</p>
<p>The People and They are One</p>
<p>One afternoon, Mr. Zheng Jin, Chief of Staff of the Huiyang Guerrilla Team, took us to the suburbs to practice target shooting.</p>
<p>Everyone was very happy to lie on the grass, aim their guns, and fire at the targets.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to be a shooter in the national liberation struggle.</p>
<p>On the way back, it was almost dusk. The warm setting sun bathed the fields and buildings. At this time, Commander Zeng Sheng also came. So we talked and laughed as we walked home.</p>
<p>The scene of the residents of Pingshan when we first arrived, and their warm hospitality, was vivid again. Every civilian sincerely invited Commander Zeng and us to sit in their houses. A blind orange seller desperately pulled Commander Zeng in to drink tea. A man surnamed Huang even invited all of us into his house, lit oil lamps, and served a lot of peanuts, rice cakes, and cigarettes as tea and sincerely entertained us. That genuine and harmonious impression will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>I can say that in a few days, the deepest impression the Huibao People's Guerrilla Team gave me was that it was completely and truly integrated with the local people. The people respected and supported them, and they defended the people, helped the people, and lived a life inseparable from the people.</p>
<p>The existing organizations in Pingshan are the Guerrilla Team, the Comrades Association, the Self-Defense Team, and the Winter Defense Team, all of which are guided by the Huibao Guerrilla Team. Because they are able to eliminate the people's miscellaneous taxes for the Huibao people as much as possible, farmers from nearby villages run to Pingshan to do business. At the same time, they often go to help the countryside harvest wheat, plant fields, carry burdens, and clean the streets of the market, provide free medical treatment to the people, and hold mass meetings. Every job makes the people feel that the guerrilla team is a good friend of the people.</p>
<p>Recently, they have also organized a new spring lion dance team and a drama and singing team to go back to their hometowns to do mass movement work, which has been well received by the people.</p>
<p>In the war to defend our homeland, enlisting the people, organizing the people, and arming the people are urgent tasks. The Hui guerrillas are indeed a good model. This progressive guerrilla team can also defend the Dongjiang and the British.</p>
<p>Life, Work, Struggle, Are Leaping Forward!</p>
<p>After dinner, the evenings in the countryside are filled with pleasant and gentle evening breezes.</p>
<p>Groups of people are dancing and singing in the courtyard or under the sparse forest. The most practiced song is "The KMT-CPC Cooperation March."</p>
<p>The usual evening games have begun. The boys and girls are all active and sitting in a circle, laughing almost unrestrainedly, playing "Hide and Seek" and "Support the Leader." Not only are they playing by themselves, but even the Chief of Staff and the Political Instructor are pulled in to play for a long time. The Chief of Staff was caught and performed Tai Chi before being let go.</p>
<p>The young and energetic live excitedly. That's what the guerrilla team is like.</p>
<p>Now their daily life is lively and intense. In addition to the daily routine of running cross-country in the morning, after meals they begin to study guerrilla warfare tactics, such as shooting methods, night marching, etc., and academic politics, such as On Protracted War, the United Front, etc., every day from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The evening is for free study, and at 8:00 PM it's time to sleep, but at night, cross-country night marches are often held because the guerrilla team needs to be proficient in night marching to be able to fight. The nearby mountains are almost climbed over by them, and sentries are dispatched at night to stand guard on the nearby mountains. Recently, with the tense situation, more sentries have been dispatched, going as far as ten or twenty miles.</p>
<p>In learning about life, in addition to individual learning, there is also a simple library in each department. The books are all on the subject of guerrilla warfare. In addition, there is a Sun Yat-sen Room, which is dedicated to strengthening the learning of each team, often publishing wall newspapers, holding political discussions, and problem discussion forums.</p>
<p>Recently, a mimeographed publication, "Military-Civilian Weekly," was also published, with a good inaugural issue, which was distributed to friendly troops and the public for reading. In the midst of our imminent departure, many meaningful competitions were planned, including wall newspaper and essay competitions, target shooting competitions, distance jumping, and mountain climbing.</p>
<p>With these many practical situations, we can see that the lives and work of the Huiyang People's Guerrilla Team itself are developing under discipline, liveliness, and seriousness. The main tasks at present are to mobilize the people, eliminate traitors, prevent bandit activities, help the government promote wartime work, consolidate itself and expand the organization, and improve the combat effectiveness of the troops so that each member can become a cadre of the guerrilla team in the future, and become heroic fighters to defend their homeland and strive for national freedom and liberation.</p>
<p>Postscript: The author's stay in Pingchu this time was very short, and it is a pity that I could not write out the attitude of these active and excellent national warriors more concretely and profoundly. At the same time, many military and environmental matters are inconvenient to disclose, which is also unavoidable. (End)</p>

<h3>Silver Star's Self-Examination</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>— Can Help You Too —</p>
<p>People who don't plan for the distant future will have immediate worries. This saying is the same in China and abroad. A group of filmmakers in Hollywood, perched on the throne of stars, earning huge salaries that make people envious, but smart people still look back from time to time to find a reliable retirement path. In the past, many people saved money, purchased property, or made credit loans. Now, things are not so simple. Some people have said: A bank deposit of 100,000 gold yuan is not as good as a skill. And the following ten questions are raised by ten red-hot big stars. The reason why they ask themselves is to hope to be prepared for any eventuality and to serve as a future path. We also have no shortage of red stars. After shining brightly, have they prepared their own questions?</p>
<p>(1) Do you have other income-generating businesses besides engaging in the film industry? — Ge Yin Dai Falei</p>
<p>(2) Do you have the common sense to deal with everything? — Zhenni Maidangna</p>
<p>(3) Can you spend ten days alone in the woods with only a hunting gun and some simple camping gear? — Kelake Gai Boer</p>
<p>(4) Can you be loyal to hard and difficult work without resigning? — Ailuo Fulin</p>
<p>(5) Can you use a news reporter's camera to take good photos? — Lisi Lian Huohua</p>
<p>(6) Is your intellectual preparation more substantial than your material preparation? — Luyi Si Lanna</p>
<p>(7) Can you cook and manage a home for one or even twenty people? This question is limited to women — Taoluosi Deli Ao</p>
<p>(8) Have you fulfilled your true responsibility for the welfare of your neighbors? — Beixi Laisi Peng</p>
<p>(9) Can you join the war for justice and peace? — ？Hualun Weilian</p>
<p>(10) If your current plan fails, can you start over without any discouragement? ? — Weilian Baohui Er</p>
<p>After the opinions expressed by these ten major stars, Qiong Bailangdaier also gave women a unique answer. She said: "Finding a man who can answer all the above questions to be your husband is the most reliable path for women." Of course, she didn't say this without reason, she had already found her Dick Bao Hui Er.</p>
<p>Why are Some Big Stars Unhappy?</p>
<p>(Continued from Yesterday)</p>
<p>"Compared to those suave male stars, I have to work twice as hard on the set. As soon as they appear on the silver screen, people immediately support them. But me? In every simple shot, I have to carefully use all my acting skills. So what I need is a profound and powerful plot and a lively and vivid character, but few such characters are assigned to me every year."</p>
<p>Let us visit Qiaozhi Lai Futo again, he is also one of them, and has other good reasons to be dissatisfied with his employer.</p>
<p>"The company doesn't give me any room to think. It seems that I should do exactly what they think. When I slightly protest, they say, 'Qiaozhi, can't you be quiet and do a good job? When you only earned 200 yuan a week before, you had a good temper. Now that you have such a big salary, you are so dissatisfied.'</p>
<p>"What I mean is, since they are big-salary stars, then they are successful in their careers, at least they should have the right to say a few words about things that are not to their liking. For example, many stars have their private cameramen, but I don't. Many actors have private writers to help them with the script, but I don't. Even my huge salary is not enough. I must live in a very good apartment, which costs a lot of money. If I lived in those worse houses, even the company would be ashamed for me."</p>
<p>Maybe you think: "What does it matter? Since they don't treat you well, just let them be ashamed for you."</p>
<p>But Qiaozhi can't think like that, his difficulties are many. Shaking his head, he said,</p>
<p>"No, I can't do that. I still want to try my best to do a good job... but, look at the roles they assign me—it's the same old routine, without any changes. I want to play other roles, but I can't get a good opportunity."</p>
<p>He also wants to play other roles? Coincidentally, but when you ask him what role he wants to play, he doesn't say it happily.</p>
<p>"I know it myself," his voice is very sad, his troubles are indeed not small.</p>
<p>"Listen," he said sincerely, "I just want to be able to wear a uniform."</p>
<p>This is the change in Hollywood. Everyone is not very happy, each has his own reasons, and among them, it seems that Qiaozhi should be the most troubled. (Yi)</p>
<h3>Introduction to the First Round of Films: The Waltz King</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>This is an outstanding work among musical films. It uses the most advanced film technology to create a most moving, beautiful, emotional, and poetic environment. Within this environment unfolds a sorrowful and enchanting story, a life experience like a poem, and the life of Johann Strauss, a most memorable figure in musical history and master of the waltz. From his passion for composition leading him to resign from his bank job, to his old age when he was loved and admired, the film recounts his life's joys, sorrows, separations, and reunions. It also uses extremely delicate tones to depict how two women's different loves controlled his life's destiny.</p>
<p>Luise Rainer plays Johann Strauss's wife in the film, a typical virtuous helper who reverently loves her husband with great fervor, yet never dares to possess him as her own, and even sacrifices her own rights and happiness to complete her husband's career. This female star with Eastern characteristics has always had a unique character performance in her past films, her delicate and subtle performances having touched the heartstrings of every audience member. Her superior acting skills have earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress for two consecutive years. In this film, she is the most noteworthy character. Playing the opera singer is Miliza Korjus, who is herself a rising star in the European stage scene. In this, her first appearance on the silver screen, her outstanding singing voice is her best self-introduction to the audience. She is a new discovery in the film industry, and in both acting and singing art, she is comparable to Jenny Lind without being inferior. Her future achievements are limitless. The acting of the male lead, Fernand Gravey, is also excellent and pleasing.</p>
<p>The special feature of this film is not only the grand and moving song and dance scenes, the exquisite and enchanting love story, and the complete and excellent orchestra, but also the extremely subtle and detailed depiction of the composer's state of mind when composing and the environment that created that state of mind. Like the scene in the Viennese mountains, in a beautiful and harmonious morning, Johann Strauss accompanies his lover, strolling in the charming Viennese mountains. At that time, the fragrance of flowers, the sounds of birds, and the murmuring streams accompany the clear sound of the shepherd boys' flutes, and the rhythm of the horse's hooves. He relied on the songs of nature to create a great work, "Tales from the Vienna Woods." The violin performance is an outstanding program in the film, which also features one of the most valuable violins in the world, worth $80,000. The sound recording is perfect and can completely preserve the essence and the beautiful musical rhythm.</p>

<h3>Today's First Division Football League: All Four Chinese Teams in Action; The Match Between the 5th Battalion Artillery and Middlesbrough is Also Important</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Today, in the city of football, several exciting battles will take place. The general public can choose according to their preferences and participate in the battles.</p>
<p>South China South vs. Kwong Wah, and South China Chinese vs. St. Joseph's, will be held at Jia Shan, one after the other. Eastern will cross the sea to battle the "local snake" Kowloon Club at their home ground. It is believed that this match will be more intense and watchable than the others.</p>
<p>South China South and Eastern are currently in the second and third positions in the point standings, and their future prospects are very promising. If South China South continues to win from now on, they can still win the championship. If Eastern also does not fail, they can still get the runner-up. In short, the success or failure of these two teams will be critical to the overall situation. The current standings of the top three are as follows:</p>
<p>The match between the Second Division 5th Battalion Artillery and Middlesbrough is crucial to the championship issue. If the Artillery wins, they will secure the championship. Otherwise, South China and the Middlesbrough military team will rise up and compete for the title. The current standings of the top three are as follows:</p>
<p>In the match between South China South and Kwong Wah, Kwong Wah is inferior in terms of talent and strength. In theory, South China South will win. However, all the members of Kwong Wah have been diligently practicing recently, and the whole team has improved, especially in the "high-speed" performance in the first half. Any strong team will feel threatened by them. Therefore, although Kwong Wah admits that it is difficult to escape defeat today, the collapse will definitely not be in the first half, but rather in the last twenty minutes of the second half. Therefore, please pay attention to this point and see if my prediction is correct.</p>

<p>The match between Eastern and Kowloon is for the field issue. I am not worried about Eastern's lack of strength to win, but I am worried that it will not be easy to perform in that field. Although the Kowloon Club is not excellent, it has created an undefeated record at home because of the advantage of the terrain. This kind of habitual superiority is indeed something to be proud of. I hope that all the members of Eastern will work together today and not be discouraged by the unfavorable terrain, which will affect the morale of the army. They should also think of a countermeasure to win. But be careful not to rush into battle, because rushing into battle in that field will be counterproductive. With a strong enemy in front of you, take care of yourself.</p>

<p>Bo Liaoyachen, Lu Wei, Di, Tushendushi, Weizuo, Zhi, Lu Xiaonuos</p>
<p>The match between South China Chinese and Joseph is not of great importance. The performance will be very ordinary. Moreover, Joseph's team is disorganized, and it is not known how they will line up. In theory, if South China performs a little better, they will definitely get two points.

<h3>Shanghai Football News: Tung Wah Defeats Hebrae again; Hebrae Getting Worse Lately</h3>
<p>[Shanghai News, 27th] In the first round of the Western Union Football League, Tung Wah defeated strong rival Hebrae by four to three. Yesterday morning, they met again in the second round. The audience was expecting a big battle. Unexpectedly, Hebrae has been getting worse lately. Lefevre was not playing yesterday, and the forward line had no room to move. As a result, they lost to Tung Wah by six to three. Tung Wah took the lead by four to one in the first half, and the audience was very happy. Although it was windy and rainy yesterday morning, the Yiyuan field was still crowded with thousands of spectators.</p>

<p>Scoring Two Goals in a Row</p>
<p>Tung Wah kicked off and the offensive was very strong. Dai and Jia penetrated twice, but without success. Binghao's shot also went wide. At this time, the Hebrae team was surrounded by enemies, and the situation was completely controlled by Tung Wah. Not long after, A'Dai dribbled the ball and bent his bow, about to shoot when Simmons suddenly rushed up and bumped into him. A'Dai hooked the ball back, which was wonderful, but unfortunately it missed by an inch and bounced back off the post. After eight minutes of stalemate, Jia Shen simultaneously broke in and Youliang just tapped it in. One to zero, Tung Wah opened the scoring. Eight minutes after the start of the match, the Hebrae team counterattacked, and Keppstin's close shot was saved by Dayun. Brettening rushed up, and Jiang Zhaoxiang cleared the danger with one kick. At the 14th minute, Youliang passed to Shiyan, and Brett tried to block Shiyan, but Shiyan had already passed to Wanjin, who dribbled the ball into the empty goal. Two to zero.</p>
<p>Leading by Four to One</p>
<p>Tung Wah scored two goals in a row, and the Hebrae team became even more tired. At the 28th minute, the Hebrae team suddenly showed its edge, and McDen used his only fierce shot, which grazed the goal. Unexpectedly, just two minutes later, Mata flew to the goal and kicked fiercely. Dayun扑了 but still slid in, and the Hebrae team won a goal (two to one). They wanted to chase after the victory, and the whole army advanced, intending to attack sharply, but the defense was empty. At the 34th minute, A'Dai saw the weakness and rushed with the ball, and sure enough, he passed the pass, and there was no one around him, and he scored calmly (three to one). After another five minutes, A'Dai scored another beautiful shot. In the first half, Tung Wah took an absolute advantage with four to one.</p>
<p>Suddenly Turned Downward</p>
<p>After that, the situation was unusually dull, and the stalemate lasted for more than 20 minutes. The offensive of both sides was evenly divided, with Tung Wah still occupying two parts. Until the 24th minute, McDen kicked from afar, and Dayun thought it would go out, but unexpectedly it rolled into the left corner (four to two). Tung Wah suffered an unexpected loss. At the 33rd minute, Keppstin shot from the side, and the ball hit the left post and fell near. Dayun quickly saved it, but Brettening, Ingerlund, and Mata rushed over and knocked him down, and Brettening kicked him in the abdomen. He was on the ground for a minute, and the ball flew past the goal, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, Zhaoxiang kicked it out. At the 39th minute, Shen Shiyan picked up the ball, and Brett kicked it back. Lin Dianhua sent a long shot from 30 yards away, just hitting the crossbar. Brett leaped up and扑了 it out, but it had already crossed the goal line, making it five to two. Two minutes later,阪戴建功 again, making it six to two. One minute later, 馬建 shot from the side, hitting the right corner diagonally,扳成 six to three. Soon the whistle sounded, and Tung Wah won by six to three.</p>
<h3>Do Not Enter a Dangerous Country: Li Huitang Stops Going to Shanghai; The Reason Is the Opposition of Public Opinion Here</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Society and the Refugee Relief Association organized a charity football tournament. In order to attract the audience and raise more funds, they specially agreed to invite the King of Football, Li Huitang, to Shanghai to participate. Because it was a good deed, Mr. Li also agreed. It was originally scheduled to go to Shanghai for the competition during the Lunar New Year. Because there was a Hong Kong-Philippines international match in Hong Kong, Mr. Li requested to postpone it to around March 12. All the Shanghai fans were also eagerly looking forward to it. But today, Mr. Li has sent a letter to Shanghai, refusing the invitation. The reason is the opposition of public opinion here, and they jointly sent a letter to Mr. Li, saying that it is not advisable to enter a dangerous country. Although Mr. Li himself was reluctant to give in, he decided to stop going to Shanghai due to the opposition of the opinion circles.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Lido Breaks the Russian Overseas Chinese; The Door is Wide Open and There is an Unprecedented Record; The Russian Overseas Chinese Barely Win Back a Goal</h3>
<p>(Shanghai News) In the internal group competition of the Western Union Football League, Lido vs. the Russian Overseas Chinese Association, the two sides competed in the rain at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon on the 26th. The strength of the two sides was very different, and the whole game was controlled by Lido. The five forwards of Lido broke through the enemy's door repeatedly. The Russian Overseas Chinese Association was at a loss and could not be saved. Only in the first half did they try their best to win a goal, avoiding being shut out. Lido scored nine goals in one breath. At the end of the first half, it became nine to one. After the break, Lido scored another 14 goals in a row. Finally, several players from the Russian Overseas Chinese Association withdrew, and only seven players played, and the lineup was extremely dilapidated. The overall situation became more and more fragmented, and they were defeated by Lido by one to twenty-seven. Such a large number is almost a basketball record.</p>

<h3>Key Wisdom Middle School; A Record of the Football Team's Tour of Macau (1)</h3>
<p>— Liu Dianguang</p>
<p>Last month, on the 25th, I and the comrades of the Key Wisdom Boys' Middle School football team traveled to Macau. We stayed for a few days. Although the trip was hasty, we saw and heard a lot. Now that I have nothing to do after returning, I will record one or two things day by day in a notebook style. I know that the eastern neighbors and western claws are not enough for readers to read, but the comrades who traveled together with us may be able to learn from it.</p>
<p>"The foundation of a country is in the home, and the foundation of the home is in the body." This is what is meant by deep-rooted. Therefore, physical education has a great benefit to the body and mind. It can develop and change biology, physiology, and psychology, and it has a close relationship with moral, physical, group, and aesthetic education. If we want to avoid the natural elimination of the people, and if we want to prevent the national strength from being weak, then we cannot普及promote體育physical education. Switzerland is the oldest and smallest democratic country in the world. In the 13th century, it was forced by strong neighbors and lurked silently, almost having the general outline of the national disaster of survival. Therefore, inspiring the youth of the whole country, they actively advocated the movement of physical training, and strictly trained them, and then established a strong national fortune. Today, the national crisis of our country is more serious than that of Switzerland. How can we not be ashamed of it? Mr. Chen Yuan, the principal of Key Wisdom Middle School, and Ms. Lin Lixiu, said during the memorial week that in this time of national crisis, which is related to the life and death of the entire nation, we should 目強不息 and break the current national crisis and open up a bright future. Now, the reason why the world lives in competition and survival is not only in great strength, not only in material things, but the use of material things is still in the spirit of people. Only with a healthy spirit can we use material things, and not be used by material things. A healthy spirit must be in a healthy body. Only with a healthy body can we strive to the end, and not give up halfway. With a beginning and an end, otherwise, even if there is a 不屈不撓 spirit, it will not be able to last. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident, physical education has been listed as a textbook for extraordinary times, and its development has been rapid and new every day. Three days after New Year's Day of the old year, the team was organized to travel to Macau. Mr. Lei Xueqin, the holy hand of table tennis, agreed to contact the competition matters on behalf of the matter, and decided to start on the 25th of the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>More than 20 comrades of the our trip to Macau are all rising stars. They have participated in public and academic ball games in this port. Although the strength is not dare to be said to be strong, the personal experience is extremely rich. However, please readers do not misunderstand what I said. Our expedition is not to Macau to show off our power to overseas Chinese. The mission of Macau is twofold: (1) to connect with overseas Chinese to save the country, and (2) to promote physical education and research ball games with overseas Chinese. This time, the team members include Chen Xinqiu, Gu Jiaju, Liao Qi, Chen Weisheng, Lin Guohong, Lu Chongli, Bao Dagao, Chen Zhenpeng, Yang Jinzhuang, Ruan Zhenna, Xu Qihao, Wu Lihan, Li Xianbin, Pan Yongzhong, Cai Yuangen, Chen Xiaozhang, and Zhang Jiugang as the team leader, document and military reporter Liu Dianguang, Cadres Tang Linghan, Chen Jiansheng, Finance Zuo Hongkui, Coach Hu Zhenbiao.

<h3>Thinking of Snatching the Ball</h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>Football is for kicking, but fans—including the players—seem to have a persistent dream: that the ball would never leave their feet. Feet aren't much good at grabbing, so some people like the rugby game where it’s permissible to use hands. This is still called football, but in reality, one can ignore the feet and just talk about the ball. In this kind of game, it’s still uncommon for someone to hold onto the ball for a long time. The task of those without the ball is to snatch it, and the aim of the person holding the ball is to avoid being snatched. If someone happens to get the ball right at the end of the game, naturally everyone lets them hold it and ignores them, and then they lose interest in holding it. The basis of this kind of competition is entirely built on the fact that there is only one goal to compete for. We probably can't hope for a ball game where everyone has their own ball. Only when children are playing ball can you sometimes see that even though everyone has a ball, they still either think someone else's is better, or want to have more than one, or want to play with every ball.</p>
<p>We are very likely to give this primitive form of competition a derogatory name: child's play. Besides, it seems that humans are not very good at making rules for anything other than games, and it is only in the child's play of games that you only see it among children, while child's play in other aspects is mostly done by adults. We often compare international politics to a ball game, but that is actually an overestimation. It’s not because I thought of a ball game that this association suddenly popped up, but rather because when I saw that boot-shaped place on the map, and the ball at the edge of the boot, I couldn't help but think about how the ball in geography would be played. So I started to think about it, and then thought back to it, focusing entirely on the game of playing ball.</p>
<p>The ball in geography cannot be moved. Perhaps this fundamentally makes it incomparable to playing ball. There are quite a few islands in the oceans that are described as the jewels of a certain ocean, but there is no mention of calling them balls. However, in the eyes of those who covet them, they are more like jewels, while in the hands of the holders, they are more like balls, especially next to the boot. We can't help but think of a ball. The Mediterranean is an old playing field. The council members on the field often change, and the players in the same batch are not necessarily playing the same ball. However, the one at the edge of the boot is always an important one. Those who lose this ball become losers, needless to say, and all those who have played this ball are also losers. We don't know who has the right to say that this ball was originally theirs. We know that in the very early days, it belonged to Greece, and Greece was ultimately injured by it. The Carthaginians also seemed to have a greater right of possession, and their country was almost entirely destroyed because of it. There is no end to such stories. In the middle, there were even situations with the playing field and the boot. The fact that this ball became neglected because another ball became more important was not necessarily a blessing for this ball. Not long ago, the ball reappeared and became active, causing the so-called heart of the Mediterranean to stop beating, naturally stirring up the waves in the sea again.</p>
<p>The fate of the ball seems to be that it should be passed around and not be permanently stuck to one foot. Ball players naturally have the illusion that the ball can never leave their feet, but as children see it, it may not be because they have taken a fancy to someone else's ball and are focused on trying to snatch it, and have forgotten about the ball next to them.</p>
<h3>Li Changren</h3>
<p>— Litian</p>
<p>Li Yin was a captain-ranked military officer. Because of his height, which was more than five or six inches taller than the average person, the first thing people noticed about him was his height. Whenever he heard the bugler blowing the assembly call, after tightening his waist belt, he would unceremoniously stand proudly in the first row, often with an air of "disdaining everything." In the army, whether his fellow officers or superiors, they all called him "Gaolao" (Cantonese for "tall person") instead of his name. Even the orderlies serving him privately used his "nickname."</p>
<p>One morning at dawn, the XX Regiment of the XX Division of the Army was ordered to arrive at its destination. The officers and soldiers, filled with the joyous expression of preparing to show their skills, were each or cooperatively busy with their work. Li Yin, known as a tall man, took a junior officer and two soldiers and ran to the small hill opposite them. He picked up the binoculars hanging around his neck and looked left and right at the villages shrouded in the faint dust in front of them. At that time, their ears gradually began to hear the clear sound of artillery fire.</p>
<p>The regimental headquarters received a report from the sentry: the XX troops in front were attempting to attack our position along the southwest highway, with tanks at the vanguard, according to intelligence. At that time, our flat-trajectory guns had already actively moved to the side of the highway, preparing to begin our sacred mission.</p>
<p>Rumble! Rumble! An unusual sound of vehicles, like ten thousand horses galloping, approached from afar. Then, the sounds of artillery fire, gunfire, and hand grenades thundered, and the flying dirt covered the earth. Peeking out from the distant woods, one could see a tank of the XX troops limping beside the highway. This saw-like artillery battle continued to be sustained, advancing and retreating.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the sound of XX planes from XX came from the air. Initially, there were three planes in a triangular formation, followed by a total of seven planes coming from the northeast. Reaching the sky above the battlefield, they circled around, like a flock of hungry eagles eager to find food. After a burst of machine gun fire shot down, there was a booming sound of bombs. A soldier squatting to the left of Li Changren, cocking the bolt of his rifle, said softly to him: "Ah, the regimental headquarters has been hit and is on fire!" As he continued to listen quietly to the sound of the bombs being dropped, he suddenly heard a earth-shattering loud noise. It turned out that our flat-trajectory gun position had also been hit.</p>
<p>Kill! Kill! Boom! Boom! Boom Boom! After the XX troops' tanks rushed through our position, what followed was a cavalry. Mixed with the various sounds was a shout of killing. It was our charging team leaping out of the trenches and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the XX troops' cavalry.</p>
<p>After about an hour, after the sounds of killing gradually stopped, Li Changren poked his head out of the pile of weeds and looked in front of him. Besides the countless corpses lined up and the wounded soldiers who were dying and moaning, the earth had gradually returned to silence, as if forgetting the intense scene just now.</p>
<p>He seemed to wake up from a great dream and tentatively climbed to the vicinity of the highway. Because of his height, in order to reduce the target, he walked hunched over like a hunchback. However, as soon as his heels stepped on the highway, he saw Company Commander Du of the XX Battalion bravely sacrificed. He grabbed the Mauser pistol from beside his corpse and hurriedly left the highway, running towards the jungle in that direction. After traversing a very wide plain, he finally reached a desolate hill, which was probably several miles away from the battlefield that day. He stood at the top of the hill, took a breath, wiped the mud-covered military uniform on his body with his hand, and tightened his waist belt again with force, shouting like a commander giving an order:</p>
<p>"Those who are officers and soldiers of the XX Regiment of the XX Division, quickly run out! Follow me!"</p>
<p>From behind the hillside, a young officer still wearing the rank insignia of a second lieutenant and a messenger jumped down in response.</p>
<p>"Which way did our troops move?" he asked hastily.</p>
<p>"They probably retreated to XX Township in the northwest!" the messenger replied after saluting, while pointing in the direction.</p>
<p>The three of them accelerated forward in that direction; the messenger in front, and him and the second lieutenant officer behind.</p>
<p>After a while, the sound of horses' hooves seemed to be coming from behind the mountain. He shouted:</p>
<p>"It's not good, the XX troops' cavalry are searching. Let's quickly scatter into the sugar cane forest over there!" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Regarding Wall Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Tela</p>
<p>Here, I remember that during the period when Mr. Du Ai was the chief editor of the supplement in Japan, he enthusiastically promoted wall newspapers and encouraged young people to create such novels. He published many remarkable short stories, attracting the sympathy and love of many readers. Therefore, we must admit that wall newspapers have indeed blossomed in this place, and in the literary movement, we should also acknowledge their glorious value.</p>
<p>But we may as well frankly say that we no longer see wall newspapers active in the literary world here. Is it that wall newspapers are no longer liked by people, or have wall newspapers ended their lovely future? Absolutely not. The main reason is that our literary movement workers have not actively guided this kind of creation, and the authors and editors in the literary garden have not been able to reach a consistent attitude towards this kind of creation. This is something that we should have examined today.</p>
<p>In order to prevent everyone from forgetting the meaning and function of wall newspapers, we must solemnly point out that in the stage of the War of Resistance literature, truly popular works or works suitable for the masses should be produced in large quantities. That is, short stories of sharp and satirical or realistic stories, transferred from the wall and printed on paper, or copied from paper and written on the wall, should be published regularly. This is a very meaningful and useful thing. In this way, we can understand the characteristics of wall newspapers, which lie in adopting economical techniques and artistic and provocative styles to attract people's attention. Its themes are always fragments, portrayals of one point or one aspect of an event. It is often published together with cartoons or specially made illustrations, which is a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>In the factories and farms of the Soviet Union, the emergence of wall newspapers has made an effective contribution to the construction of socialism. And from the writers, some outstanding creators, a great reserve army of socialist literature, can often be trained or produced.</p>
<p>Currently in Japan, the newspapers for factory workers and the masses have also adopted the method of wall newspapers to promote the anti-war literary movement of the masses, and have also achieved some gains and results.</p>
<p>These should all serve as our examples. I very much hope that those writers and editors who claim to be loyal to the literature of the War of Resistance will pay attention to the works of wall newspapers, which is much better than writing those so-called "soft" articles and interesting essays that have nothing to do with the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Nothing to Be Surprised About</h3>
<p>— Moxie</p>
<p>Traitors have existed since ancient times; it did not start with me, nothing to be surprised about. Tortoises and bastard turtles are all made by humans, I am also a human being, so I might as well do it, nothing to be surprised about. Let them laugh and scold, I will be a good official myself, nothing to be surprised about…</p>
<p>How many evils in the world are lightly created in this self-explanation of "nothing to be surprised about." "Nothing to be surprised about" is a term specifically used to gloss over mistakes and defend oneself, and is simply a bad and ominous term.</p>
<p>However, "nothing to be surprised about" cannot be generalized. When used properly, it can often strengthen people's courage and increase people's ambition, and achieve its effectiveness in certain events.</p>
<p>Not being surprised by the strange, the more strange the more likely to fail, is the best annotation of "nothing to be surprised about." For example, the XX troops have fierce guns and artillery, nothing to be surprised about, we have a new Great Wall made of flesh and blood: the XX troops may use flowery words or sophistry to shake people's hearts, nothing to be surprised about, we have our own opinions: the XX troops boast wildly and intimidate with empty threats, nothing to be surprised about, our will is very firm, and our expression remains unchanged even if Mount Tai collapses in front of us…</p>
<p>However, under this "nothing to be surprised about," it can be seen that we must have something to rely on, and a way to deal with ourselves, then it will be good, otherwise this "nothing to be surprised about" will become a kind of excuse, as in the following examples:</p>
<p>When Emperor Chen Houzhu heard the news of the enemy crossing the river, he was still singing "Yushu Hou Ting Hua" with the palace maids. "Nothing to be surprised about" became a poisonous tranquilizer. When the Yuan soldiers had already approached Jiankang, Jia Sidao believed that ceding land and paying tribute was enough to settle it, and still thought that fighting crickets was important. "Nothing to be surprised about" misled the country and himself. When Li Zicheng broke through Juyong Pass and entered directly, the general ministers of the Ming court were still singing, dancing, and living a drunken and dreamy life. "Nothing to be surprised about" turned into a death that was more than deserved.</p>
<p>What is the explanation for this kind of "nothing to be surprised about"? It is nothing more than intentionally not buying it and deliberately making a mess.</p>
<p>At this point, I already know whether or not I should be surprised, and under what circumstances I can be not surprised.</p>
<p>However, what I have said above are all major national events, and the scope seems to be too broad. In terms of the individual, how should this "nothing to be surprised about" be applied? Let me give an example myself:</p>
<p>Someone told me that so-and-so has changed, has become bad, I said, nothing to be surprised about, the world is originally easy to make people bad. Someone has been promoted and become rich, I said, nothing to be surprised about, everyone originally has opportunities. Someone inexplicably treats me harshly and hurts me in secret, I smile and ignore it, feeling that there is nothing to be surprised about, because the human heart is treacherous, and it was already in my mind. Someone wants me to see the newly emerged Western scenes and Eastern scenes, I don't go, because I know what troubles, suffering, distress, displacement, and all unpleasant things I will receive. I will write them all off with "nothing to be surprised about." I admit that "nothing to be surprised about" has a great use for me, and I often use it.</p>
<p>Even if I encounter a situation where I can truly commit suicide, I will still live on. The reason is that death, in my opinion, is also nothing to be surprised about. Everyone will commit suicide, everyone will die, so why should I fall into the same old routine and follow in people's footsteps.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is still my passive "nothing to be surprised about," and some are not worth learning from, but I feel that any matters that are hot as soup or fire, in my opinion, are not worth being surprised about, and I can do them, if the environment and opportunities allow me. I myself cannot distinguish whether my "nothing to be surprised about" is passive or active.</p>
<p>I don't know if people now have the concept of "nothing to be surprised about," and I don't know what kind of "nothing to be surprised about" they have, if they have it, and to what extent. Everyone may say that I am nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<h3>"Preserving Life" and "Compensating for Death"</h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>Recently, because the puppet "Reformed Government" and various large and small puppet officials have been repeatedly assassinated and killed, those newly rich people are worried about their own safety all the time, and are always on guard against this "misfortune" falling on themselves, because although they love high positions and generous salaries, they love their lives even more.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Want money, not life," people disregard "life" for the sake of "money." This kind of behavior of entrusting "life" for "money" can still be regarded as "heroes" among hoarders. Now, these newly rich people are willing to give up money and cherish their lives. This mentality of wanting to have both fish and bear's paw is really not enough to say "want money, not life." You see, these newly rich people now have bodyguards protecting them whenever they go out. It is rumored that even when working in the city government, they have to implement temporary martial law, which shows how cold and timid they are. Those other puppet officials working in the puppet "organs" are also talking about tigers in fear, given the endless emergence of recent cases of eliminating traitors. They have all asked the "Reformed Government" to find ways to provide them with life security. However, after receiving the sad report, the "Reformed Government" once secretly convened a meeting, and they all agreed that the large and small puppet officials serving in the puppet "organs" cannot be "preserved alive," but can be compensated for death. In other words, even the lives of those "important figures of the Reformed Government" themselves are not fully protected, so how can they have the extra power to protect the lives of their subordinates? Once puppet officials are assassinated and killed, in addition to allocating a "compensation" and life support fees for the bereaved families, there are no other good policies. At this time, I wonder if the newly rich people feel the sorrow of losing their integrity?</p>
<p>According to telegrams, the "Reformed Government's" regulations for compensating puppet officials stipulate 100,000 yuan for puppet "specially appointed officials," 50,000 yuan for puppet "officials of simplified appointment," 30,000 yuan for puppet "commissioned officials," and other officials are reduced in order according to the size of their official rank. The "value" of the newly rich people is not set too low. The newly rich people who were assassinated can rest in peace under the crowd, because their stinking skins can still be sold for such a high price, which is beyond expectations. "Unable to save lives, but good at compensating for death." It would be very fitting to paste this couplet on the gate of the "Reformed Government."</p>
