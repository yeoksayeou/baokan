<h3>德意軍事同盟與英蘇談判</h3>
<p>美聯社昨日美蘭電，揭發德意兩國官方宣佈兩國外長會談結果已成立德意軍事同盟，其詳細內容雖未宣佈，但其要旨則在於德意兩國成立軍事及政治的協定，密切聯絡以對歐洲之和平作有效的貢獻（？）。意外長齊亞諾也在其機關報「電訊」中稱：「意德兩國的承認彼此各有利益範圍……各不强求同盟國援助，……惟有一事，兩國休戚相關，共同負保衛，此事卽意識之戰爭，蓋兩國均明白一國之失敗卽別國之不幸云」。於此之可見其日意之一斑。</p>
<p>侵畧者的行動需要着彼此共同的帮　，因爲他們爲愛好和平的世界各國所共棄，自從希特動發動東征十字軍及意大利佔領阿爾巴尼亞而反侵略國家計劃對侵畧者加以積極的制止以來，德意侵略者更覺有趕快形成密切的聯繫以對付反侵略陣綫包圍的必要。所以首先放出英法等民主國家包圍德意的空氣，以爲締結德意軍事同盟的張本。要而言之，德意軍事及政治協定之締結，是一種必然的歸宿，早在世界明眼的政治家所預料之中。最可笑的是倫敦傳最高外交界認爲意大利所以成立德意政治軍事同盟，乃因法國不顧意大利要求解决法意糾紛的邀請所致。殊不知這個同盟的用意不但尖對着法國，並且由爲對付英國。齊亞諾不是宣稱「德意兩國各有利益範圍，意在地中海全區，德則在波羅的海及中歐地帶」嗎？那一部分都和英國有特別密切的關係。柏林評論界更是强調着：德國最近之作爲，在於「衝破英國包圍陣線」，德國外交政現正集中於與英國作外交上之鬥爭；其他一切事宜則暫視爲次要之舉。</p>
<p>在德意集中衆矢進擊英國的今日，英國更應以加强的集體力量予以還擊。目前，除加緊英法及中東歐諸小國的　結外，最重要的一着就是英蘇合作。正如倫敦輿論界所認識的，「英蘇談判已到緊要階段」，英蘇雙方各有不同範圍的建議，而英國昨日提與蘇聯的新提案，要求蘇聯政府作單方的宣言，無異於表示拒絕訂立英法蘇軍事同盟，或派要員舉行會議。這於蘇聯固是絕大的不幸，但於英國不幸尤甚大。因爲德國陰謀攻蘇誘引波蘭合作的計劃，現在大部分已因波蘭之拒絕與準備抵抗失掉了效力（如法國所揭露），而對英的進攻陰謀正在着着進行中。德國誠恐英國接近蘇聯，加强其力量，所以近日來對于英法蘇的合作，特別加以種種的離間。漢堡報稱：『自西班牙戰爭結束後，蘇聯已感覺有放棄與民主國家更加親慝之必要。』</p>
<p>德意侵畧者所恐懼的是英法蘇共同領導下反侵略集團的强力制止，德國尤其恐懼蘇聯因爲英法蘇一國的切實合作而積極援助東歐諸小國，英國今日要保障自已須要先保障充當自己屛障的諸小國。英國要保障諸小國，就非依賴蘇聯的助力不可。英國要制止侵略者對自己的進攻，只有採用明顯積極加强集體的力量，而不是討得德意的諒解。德國聲言英國領導反侵畧陣綫對德包圍，只是侵畧行動的藉口；英國若因此而疎遠了蘇聯，就上了侵略者的大當，首先受其害的是英國本身。</p>
<p>侵畧者的團結已日益鞏固，而反侵略陣綫的領導者却還悶在鼓中。此種動向是極危險的喲！</p>
<h3>關於陜甘甯邊區政府</h3>
<p>— 林祖涵</p>
<p>陝甘寗邊區第一屆參議會席上，林伯渠（祖涵）先生發表關於陝甘寗邊區政府的工作報告。以供每一個參議員作爲檢查政府與决定今後方針的根據。這個報吿共分三個部分：第一部份是「保衛和鞏固陝甘寗邊區是全國人民和全邊區人民的共同任務」：第部份是「兩年來邊區政府在保衛邊區和保衛全中國的抗戰中所做的工作」：第三部份是「抗戰現階段中邊區政府的任務」。這裏發表的是林先生報吿中的第一部份，共分四章。</p>
<p>保衛和鞏固陝甘寧是全邊區全中國人民的共同任務</p>
<p>第一，日前的坑戰形勢和邊區所處的環境句括我所要談的陝甘寧邊區的存在問題</p>
<p>中華民族爲了自己的生存與日本××主義進行着大規模的戰爭，到現在巳經二十個月了。在這二十個月當中，我們失掉了許多同胞們，失掉了許多政治經濟文化的中心城市，我們喪失了很　的生命財產，換句話說，是我們受到了暫時的局部挫折，這個掙折，使我們逢到了很大的困難，並且這困難還將隨着抗戰的深入新階段而增加起來。然而兩年來的抗戰給中國帶來了前所未有的各方面的進步。兩年來拉戰的　驗敎訓，證明了抗日戰爭原是個長期的殘酷的艱難困苦的過程只要我們能够不怕犧牲。不怕痛苦，堅持長期戰爭　最後勝利是必屬於我們的，而支持長期戰爭與最後勝利的唯一道路，就在於全民埃的更，加團結與進步。現在堅持繼續抗戰巳成爲既定國策，全國軍民抗戰情緒愈益高漲，親日妥協份子已開始從　戰陳營中洗刷出去，英美法國際的對華援助漸趨積極，這正是中國　加團結與進步的表徵。另一方面，×人在佔領武漢廣州的戰鬥後，却更暴露出了它的兵力不足與兵力分飲的弱點，逐漸失去了它的海陸空軍配合作戰的優勢，在×人佔領的廣大地方，到處都可以看見我們游擊　爭的活躍，使得×人疲於奔命，勢將被迫改變他的計劃；但是我們仍須充分估計×人還有一點餘威，並其周密的準備繼續向西南與西北進攻，同時將抽調兵力進攻我們的游擊根據地。我們尤須要充分估計×人除進備新的軍事進攻之外，正加緊桃撥離間，勾結親日妥協份子，企圖從內部瓦解抗戰陣營。</p>
<p>就是這個陰謀的第一次大拐曉，企圖成立反蔣反共的僞中央政權，這正是目前政治形勢的一個嚴重現象，在這種形勢下，邊區所處的環境是很顯明的。×人的進攻西北與邊區，無疑是×人進攻計劃中的一個重要部分，因此我們必須反對那種幻想，以為×人不會而且也不敢進攻西北與邊區。拿邊區來說，把去年三月×軍會度一占領府谷城，九月間×人曾炮擊宋婁川，十一月二十四以來，×機屢次轟炸延安，這些事實，不是都說明邊區已經成爲×人直接進攻的目標了嗎？但是同時我們也决不要看到×人準備進攻西北與　區，就張惶失措起來。過去幾次×人的進攻都遭到我們的打擊，結果迫使×人不得不暫時撇返。今後卽使×人來進攻，我們也有把握堅持我們的根據地。配合友軍，爲保衛西北與邊區而戰的任務，我們早已提出來了。這裏要指出的就是×人爲了實現進攻邊區的計劃，曾經不斷利用漢奸托　和頑固份子在邊區周圍和邊區內部進行各種陰謀破壞的活動，並在全國範圍內有系統地飲播關於破壞邊區。破壞八路軍與共產黨的言論例如說邊區政府應該取消，八路軍游而不擊，共產黨應該解散等等，或者把邊區和國民政府和全國人民分離起來，以便達到進攻邊區和西北以及截　中蘇交通綫的目的。他所發表的主張就包括着許多荒　的意見，這豈不是明顯的證據嗎？因此我們的任務就在　動，全邊區的力量，配台友軍的力量來迎擊日×邊區與西北的進攻，並支持前線的戰爭。在此任務下，我們要提高全邊區人民的警覺性，防止漢好托派頑固份子的陰謀活動。我們要警吿那此自覺或不自覺的受日×漢奸托派影嚮而搖旗吶喊，反對與破壞邊區，反對與破壤八路軍與共產黨一的人們；你們這樣做，正爲日本××主義所歡迎。不論你們前送上如何，你們實際上是在削弱全民族抗戰的力量，無異於幫助日×來滅亡中國！你們的錯誤必須改正，否則千秋的漫罵應將加在你們的頭上。</p>
<p>第二，邊區在抗戰中的重要性</p>
<p>日本××主義爲什麽處心積慮要進攻邊區呢？這本來是沒有什麽奇怪的，無疑的是因爲邊區在抗戰中站在一個　常重要的地位，邊區在抗戰中的重要性究竟現在那些事實上呢？它主要的表現，在：</p>
<p>一，邊區在全中國說來是個政治上重要的地區。　裏的民　，在十年以來，就已經用自己的力量，建立了民族解放戰爭的　　，實現了民族主義，得到了民主自由，實現了民權主養；得到了民生改　，實現了民生主義，至於最近數年中却堅持了抗日民族統一戰線，爲團結全國　盡很多的努力。抗戰十八個月中，爲援助前線而貢歡了很大的力量；在等端困難的條件之下堅持正確的政治方向發揚了艱苦的工作作風，厲行了廉潔政治。試問在全國範圍內有多少與邊區政府這樣廉潔的政府？邊區政府是中央政府下所轄的一個地方政府，邊區是中國的一部份領土，尙不止此，它又是先進的一部份。我們幷不誇大的說，邊區實在是一模範的抗日根據地，在邊區，除漢奸外，給予人民以完全的民主權利，人民不但有言論，出版，集會，結　，武裝的完全自由，而且實行了普遍，直接，平等，無　名的民主選舉，換句話說，邊區人民巳獲得民主自由，他們不僅自己不願做日本××主義的牛馬奴練，而且準備着同日×作堅　的鬥爭；不僅自已成立了民主抗日根據地，而且還能以自己的經驗貢歡給全國人民，致令國人民的抗日門爭與建國事業少走錯路，使全國抗戰建國的偉大事業，儘可能的早日獲得成功。</p>
<p>二，邊區擁有二百多萬人口，廣大的土地雖大部份是黃士草原，然土地肥沃，可耕的地面僅以延　等十八縣的統計卽有四十萬里，現在　耕面積則爲九百萬畝，尙有廣大地園可令開關，邊區糧食及棉花的出產極　豐富，石油食　也是大宗出產，畜牧極發達，煤鐵缊繭亦多。以這些自給條件看來，邊區也是一個堅持抗戰的好地方。而且邊區又是我們民族祖先發祥的鹽地，這裏是軒　實帶的陵墓所在地，這裏會酒上了我們矓先爲抵禦外侮面流的鮮血，這裏人民的民族的自尊心與自信心特別高漲，正是因爲邊區人民承繼了祖先的傳統。</p>
<p>三，在軍事上，因爲邊區佔有陝西，甘　，寗夏三省的各一部，西接甘　，寧夏，北接綏這，東鄰山西，所以一方　成爲保　西北的北門鎖，另一方面又成為堅持西北　戰的重要後方。邊區在軍事上說來，　也是華北和西北戰略上的支點。這就可以知道陝甘軍邊區的重要性了。×人决不會放棄陝甘寧邊區，區也必定要堅持自己的陣地，　至配合全國力量戰　這個萬惡的×人。</p>
<p>第三，邊區的產生與根據</p>
<p>正因爲陝甘寗邊區的重要性，所以它不但是不斷遭受到漢奸托　的造遙，污　，攻擊，破壞，而且亦成為某些　固份子的眼中釘，他們到處飲佈關於邊區的各種謠言，甚至說邊區是「新的封建割據一，『邊區沒有法律的根據』，因此要求取消邊區，在邊區內外　行着各種搗亂破壞的陰謀活動。這些頑固份子今日雖尙在抗日營壘的內部，然而他們今天所做的工作，實際上是利於日×的。</p>
<p>同志們：我現在來說一說，陝甘寗邊區的存在是有它的充分的歷史的，事實的與法律的根據的。現在　個邊區，在十年以前原來是個最落後的而又最復雜的區域，這　人民在經濟上受着民族的與封建的殘酷剝削，在政治上受着中世紀的非人的壓迫和奴役，在文化上落後到幾乎意想不到的程度，民國十六年以後，這裏民衆　受不了這毬　活，便在中國共產黨同志領導之下自動組織起來，武裝起來，在這個地方開　了反帝反封建的鬥爭，到了民國二十年先後建立了陝甘邊區（包括關中），陝北（包括神府）的兩個蘇維埃政府。在政治上實行了民族解放的　××主義的政策，建立了澈底的民主制度，在經濟上實行了分配土地，取消了苛捐雜稅，改良了工人的待遇，在文化上亦開始了進行　務敎育與社會敎育，而且同時普遍的組織，與武裝了人民。在民國二十四年，中國工農紅軍主力長征北上抗日，到達陝甘寧地區後，又把兩個政府和新發展的區域統一起來，建立了蘇維埃中央政府西北辦公處。　然的這個政府應該在中國共產寫中央直接領導及當地人民直接擁護與　督之下，是完全獨立自由的，革命的，民主的政府，　他麽來不同於封建軍閥的　據，因爲那裏旣無軍閥</p>
<p>（注意：此處原稿漏去一段，明日補刊）</p>
<p>蔣委員長與中共中央代表歴次談話中間也屢次承認了邊區政府的台　地位，屢次答應了發布正式承認邊區政府的命令，行政院長孔祥親先生也在蔣委員長的消示之下，巳正式確定了邊區爲行政院直　所轄的區域。所以雖是直到現在我們還沒有接到國民政府正式實成邊區政府成立的命令，而蔣委員長所答應的某些縣份尙未正式　歸邊區，然而邊區政府的合法地位是早已確定了的。當然我們並不否認陝甘寧邊區政府同其他國民政府統轄下的地區有着很人不同的地方，過去的歷史使邊區政府不能不有它自已的特點，這　特點在什麽地方呢？這是我們把三民主義的大度來測量我們的邊區時，那我就應該大胆的說：我們的特點卽在認眞的實現了三民主義與抗戰建國網領。這個特點，我們在抗戰建國的今天，不但不應取消，而且應該存在與　展光大這個實行三民主義與抗戰建國網領的邊區政府，當然，這邊　政府是最合法的政府，這是亳無　　的。除了依據三民主義最高原則與抗戰建國綱領的標準之外，還有其他的什麽合法標準呢？當然沒有了，這就是陝甘　邊區政府的產生與根據，抗日民族統一戰線的發起者與豎决實行者，三民主義與抗戰建國綱　的澈底　行者，蔣委員長的思實的擁護者，國民政府的組成部份，保衛國防，保衛西北，堅持持久戰的保　，這就是陝甘寗邊區的產生的根據。</p>
<p>第四，堅持邊區的存在，保衛邊區，爭取抗戰勝利，建設三民主義新中國的重要環節。</p>
<p>同志們：綜合前面的報告，我們的結論是，邊區的存在，邊區的鞏固，是和全國人民的利益一致的，邊區的任何損失和削弱，事實上，邊區正爲全國愛國同胞以及全世界愛好和平的人士所關懷與愛護，全國各地來延安就學的靑年結繹於途，關於邊區的詳細　簡單的介紹，　篇累牘，這些事實巳足够證明擁　邊區的存在與鞏固，正是代表全國人民的利益意志與要求，這是爭取抗戰勝利，建立三民主義新中國的一個有力的保證，兩年來，我們的一切工作，一切努力，一切鬥爭，就是朝着這個方向進行的。所以我們有充分的理由說。堅持邊區的存在，保衛邊區是爭取抗戰勝利，建立　民主義新中國的重要環節，這就是我的報吿的第一部份。</p>
<h3>全國總動員與精神總動員（下）</h3>
<p>— 凱豐</p>
<p>（三）就對民族的自信心自尊心來說——這又是對抗戰的决心和勝利的信的必要條件，如果對自己的民族妄自菲薄，總覺得別人的都是好，自己的都不行，如果對自己的民族，對自己的力量沒有足够的自信心和自尊心，那麼要堅持抗戰的决心和勝利的信心是不可能的。因此在精神動員中必須發揚我們民族中族輝歷史，尤其是在抗戰爲民族國家而英勇犧牲的民族英雄。民族叛徒漢　愧儡喪失了中國人的人性，拋棄了我中國民族先烈的民埃氣節，喪失了我中國民族的優良道德。因此在精神動員中必須提高民族氣節。發揚民挨的美德。同樣在精神動員之中必須發揚革命的愛國主義和愛民族的精神。這裏包句括兩方面，第一方面是在民衆中必須啟發愛自己的國家心理，日×正是嬰滅亡我們的國家，我們不愛自己的國家就不能生存：第二方面是在政府方面要多多在意和關切人民的痛苦，使人民　得自己的國家可愛。這兩方面是要　時並進的。必須發揚民族的思想，這種民族思想的發揚，就是要啓發對日×的仇恨，要高度的發揚對日×的民族仇恨。仰承日×鼻息的漢奸妥協份子，正在把日×製造的『大亞細亞主義』，『中日滿協』和，『中日滿共同體』運到中國來，企圖烟沒中國人民對日的民族仇恨，正是這些漢好妥　份子鼓吹超越民族的思想，同樣日×又在製造僞傀儡，而一些無　漢好，在扮演登台，一些妥協的份子企圖　讓中國的某些領土和損害中國的某些主權來求得與日的妥協，正是這些人損害中國民族的絕對獨立，損害中國領土主權的完絕對整。</p>
<p>（四）就改進政治來說——政治的改進，這保證抗戰勝利之基本條件。從抗戰以來，我國的政治巳有很多的進步，但是從對抗戰勝利的保證上來說，邪不能不說我國政治的進步，凡非常不够，在政　上抗戰的進步，還不足以保證抗戰的最後勝利，尤其在現有目前的階段上，我門須要政治迅速的進步，以便能更快的準備我們新的力量，蔣委員長指出：在二期抗戰中「政治重於軍事』這正說明了目前加速政治的進步的　要意義。因此，在精神動員中，不僅解釋對政治改進的必要，而且要進行眞的對政治的改進。同樣須要在精神動員中檢討中央政府及最高軍事的抗戰法令和軍令執行程度，如過去韓復渠，李服　等不能執行最高軍事當局的軍令，而擅自放棄國家的領土，如在某些戰綫上個別的軍事指揮官對執行最高軍　當局的命令的不堅决，如在×後的游擊區內個別的負責當局，當×人進攻的時候自動的脫逃，這些都是破壞軍令之統一。又如地方政府及下層政治機構在兵役中沒有認眞的實行中央政府的兵役法，因而造成在某些地方的役政發生勒索舞弊的現象，中央政府的優待出征軍人家屬條例，在許多地方沒有執行，因此影響兵役不能很好的進行，類似這種不執行中央政　抗戰　令的現象，正是破壞了政令的統一。</p>
<p>（五）就對民衆運動之發展來說——精神動員之目的，是要　到發揮有組織的力量，正如綱領中所說』不僅在于發動，而尢實於組織』。經過精神　員能够把更多羣衆組織起來，因此在精神動員中不僅跟於一般的解釋和宣傳，而且要能够在這解釋和宣傳中用各種的方式把民衆組織起來。要把民衆能够組織起來。首先須認眞的實行國民公約的宣誓與國民會的辦法，把各種不同性質不同職業的人民分別的按照國民月會辦法大綱召集他們開會，按期的舉行，經過國民月　的形式，利用固有組織和創立的新的組織來把經過國民公約宣誓的人民都組起來，使精神動員的工作能够經常的進行，在國民公約官誓之後，建立起對人民的經常的政治敎育，「確立抗戰意識，討論世界大勢，研究國家與亡民埃盛衰與×國外患之史實」。</p>
<p>（六）就對戰時生活之建立來說——「生活者，精神之根本，無合理之生活，卽無健全之精神」，因爲在精神動員中，必須對建立戰　生活作很大動員，戰時生活之標準，就是打破醉生夢死之生活，打破苟且偷安之生活，打破自私自利之生活，養成奮發有爲朝氣蓬勃之生活，篒成大公無私見義勇爲之生活，養成　勇犧牲之生活，身養成殺身成仁捨身取義之生活，戰時生活具體來說就是以前像將士英勇　牲艱苦奮鬥之生活爲機準。當抗戰已廿餘月之時，我們還有到前綫與後方之生活相距太遠，前方英勇權牲艱苦奮門活發緊張，而後方　還存在有不少的醉生夢死在花天酒地侈奢逸之現象，因此精神動員必須使後方之生活前方化。同樣在抗戰中貧富之生活相差懸殊，實亦爲影響勞苦大衆參加抗戰的興趣之原因，因此在精神動員以後，必須把富有之奢侈生活降低，而把勞動大衆衣食不足之生活提，這裏更能發揮勞苦大衆參加抗戰和提高生產之熱忱。</p>
<p>自私自利之生活，卽是忘記民族和國家之利益，把個人的利益超過國家民族之利益，這些人正是缺乏對國家民族的觀念，他們總想在抗戰中利用抗戰所製成的環境，利用抗戰的各毬困難，來造成　人的利益，來達成民族國家以外的企圖，來達成發國　財的企國，如是有操縱黑市，壟斷投機，營私舞弊，勒索食污等現象。精神動員中必須對這些現象加以糾正，加以制裁。</p>
<p>同樣在精神動員中必須加强對國家民族利益的觀念，使人人了解中國民族的利益，中國人民的利益應當高於革命者，他應以中國民族解放的中國人民解放利益爲利益。</p>
<p>克服對抗戰松懈的險象</p>
<p>目前戰事，在表面上似乎處在一　沉寂的狀態，這第一由於日×在佔　漢廣州後，因兵力消耗過度，不得有一個整理的時期，第二由於×在『速戰速决』的戰略被打破後，想到用正面戰爭似乎沉寂的狀况來進行政治分化的陰謀，一方面引誘一些動搖妥協份子與民族叛徒汗××之流公開投降，另一方面用似乎正面戰爭沉寂的狀態造成中國內部某些人中的和平幻想，以鬆懈我國抗戰的動員和新力的增長，同時想用似乎正面戰事沉寂狀態來造成中國內部磨擦的增加，而些眼光短小的份子爲日×這種陰謀所迷惑——不把一切意志和力量集中來加强抗戰動員和加長新的力量，而却用去製造內部的磨擦：第二由於日×想到利由這個時期集中力量「掃簜」游擊區，在這時　在逰擊區尤其在東北戰爭的緊張和激烈是前所未有，而離開游華區較遠的地方，不容易感覺到游擊區內戰爭的激烈，由於這一切的原因，在武漢廣州失守後，在一部份人中在某些地方對抗戰動員的　懈，這確是事實：在×人正在開始　的進攻的時候，這種鬆懈現象，對中國的抗戰是一個非常嚴重和危險的現象。我們經過這次精神動員，應把這一切現象應加以克服。精神動員做爲抗戰動員之一種形式，這是解釋宣傳工作就很好，要是能與組織民衆的工作相配，這一定能够發加應有的作用，因此正確的進行精神動員的工作是　生的必嬰的，精神動員的目的亦是發抑組織的力量，當强抗戰的動員，加强抗戰的力量。</p>

<h3>湯恩伯將軍會見記</h3>
<p>— 高汾</p>
<p>【本報特稿】我們會經遇到過叱咤三軍的張發奎將軍、威武挺秀的白崇禧將軍、和藹可親的吳奇偉將電。可是信兒有着一位上分質撲的着一身螞蟻布中山裝帶着農民氣質的面部表　是謙遜、精明的湯恩伯將軍、作戰時他一定單騎出巡戰綫指示下級官佐作戰，視察地形，治軍是嚴明，注重士兵敎育，部隊精銳，南口之役，徐州會戰，保衛大武漢時轉輾作戰於瑞武綫……在這許多戰投裏，都建立了功蹟，他現在巳由騁馳戰地運籌帷　的戰鬥中而轉向集中精力於訓練千百　優秀的××　部，他微笑的接見每一個來拜訪的客人。。正如他在戰地可以與農民握手聚談，並能與任何老百姓同　　　××山嶺的寺僧暢談經典，鼓勵他們參加抗戰，組織流浪的兒童，使他們受到良好的敎育，每個孩子的名字他都很親暱的叫得出……這些在各戰場曾留給老百姓不滅的印象，在××曾感化了三上餘位日本俘虜，一班老百姓生了敬愛的感情，這些所表顯的精神，是足僞許多官佐們所表率的。</p>
<p>在政治上他原有　遠見，當東戰場戰事甫告結束時，他就在他直屬部隊裏舉辦幹部訓練班，「幹部是民　的至竇」，今日他負荷着更大的使命××幹部訓練班敎育長重職。×××優秀的靑年人部分是在職的有戰鬥經驗的團長，小部分是政工人員，女同志也有一百餘位，都是全國各部隊各戰區派來的。遠如新疆，甘，綏等地的都有。「訓練是僞重於政治方面的，受訓完舉後分發到×人後方，給×人所施行之懷柔政策以打擊，運用我們自己的政權，爭取　大的民衆』。</p>
<p>『湯將軍對此次南昌失守後整个戰略上有何觀感呢！』雖則　將軍這次沒有參加指揮贛北戰役，但對整个戰局一樣有深刻的見解，他微笑的低着嗓子慢吞呑的講着：『我也沒有什麽……不過南昌失守，長沙是可保無慮的，湘北一帶的戰局穩定，×人奪取南昌，只增加他自己的負祖，人力的消耗……南昌正被我國攻中，我反攻部隊甚爲得力，×軍冀圖攫取一據點，那知反成爲被我衆　之地……』他的說話上分簡練而有力，但始終是笑喀嘻的。接　他根據目前的戰况很有把握的推測今後×人主力會集中向長江北岸一帶，以便對我游擊隊的掃蕩。</p>
<p>徐州保衛戰給給何人留着不滅的印象的，因之湯將軍又想起徐州的軍民合作，老百姓眞正帮助作戰情形了，他極力誇獎的聲浪提得特別高說：『徐州老百姓才正好，又很勇敢，他們眞能協助士兵作戰，有的愛護士兵　像愛自家人，在戰綫上送茶送水，送食品，在任何戰區是少見的事情……因之弟兄們作戰的力量，提高了很多。×』徐州所以能較持久的保衛下去，老百姓配合到紀律嚴明的軍隊做到軍民互助的地步，這止是主要原因。現在徐州失守巳整整上個月了，在這十個月中我們作戰轉入第二期，『宣傳　於作戰』『加强軍民合作』，可一是我們看到各戰區的民衆動員工作是怎樣呢？比徐州有更好的表顯還是做到至少一樣的程度呢？根據事實談，在南員前綫附近找個老百姓還一定要軍隊用千方百計的去找，在廣東前綫雖則老百姓不一定聽了炮聲就跑，但留在前綫上做漢奸也還有，這樣使我們痛苦的反省一下，我們該怎樣警　才是。</p>
<p>湯　軍的談與漸漸起來了，談到曾到訓練班敎過兩星期書的鹿地先生：「昨天他跟馮乃超先生來看過我，剛　我不在家，」他微笑着，表示十分歉仄的樣子。『我本想去看他們，但又不認得路。』同來的姚君告訴他，我們和鹿地　先生是很熟的朋友，如果現在去看他。我可以代爲引路，於是他興冲冲的站立起來　附隨從把行李照顧好，因爲兩小時後就即啟程了。我們跑出樂羣社大門，天上正下着鵝毛的雨，大家沒有帶雨衣，姚君打了一把雨傘：「我們合打一把傘吧，」他連忙歉遜的說：「不要緊，不要緊」，一忽兒雨淋得全身都濕透了，他好像並沒有覺到什麽，邊走邊談着桂林的天氣，不巧的　地先生剛巧出去，撲了個空，不免十分覺到遺憾的折囘。</p>
<p>此次湯將軍十分行色忽促的，得　暢談是恤得興奮的。（救亡社稿）</p>
<h3>稷王山戰役追記　對特一團一個士兵的訪問</h3>
<p>— 三江</p>
<p>問、聽說你們去年開到稷王山以後、和×人接過了好幾次、但每次打的</p>
<p>答、大約有三次、我們的隊伍（指特一團）打的最勇敢、</p>
<p>問、那三次呢、</p>
<p>答、第一次楊家嶺戰役（廿七年十月十四日）、受損失較大的是第六連因六連連長詹明、他親自奉領卅幾個　勇隊、黑夜兩點多鐘襲擊西景村的×人、一　不發槍、到了×人跟前、用手溜彈炸死×人三四十名、聽說×人還沒有穿褲子、自己和自己又打了一氣、天明×人反攻佔了楊家嶺、這一次×人一共死了四五十名、我們傷亡士兵九名、第二次（十一月八日）×人一千多、分三路進攻稷王山、一路由邵村東莊、一路由邵村、這兩路都是向山門莊攻擊、另一路到三路李村、用砲　擊八將門和山門莊、山門莊僅第七連和他打了多半天、但第七連利用工事伏擊、等×人到了跟前後、乃用輕響槍步槍猛擊、結果因×人兵力太多、第七連遂撤至溝內、×人乃向三路李村撤去、這一次×人傷亡二三十名、我們士兵受機槍傷者一、受砲　者二、第三次（十二月五日）×人八路圍攻稷王山、第三營與×作戰最激烈、自從上午三點　×人開始攻擊後、第三營一直和×人打到黃昏時候才算完了、</p>
<p>問、請你將這次戰鬥經過情形詳　和我說一下</p>
<p>答、×人由漠　村開始攻擊時、正是兩點多鐘、因爲第三營的陣地　漢薛村附近、（在郭家岔、山門莊一帶距該村五里）　勢又比較的低、所以×人用密集隊形一直就從後面來了、這時候顏營長　得報告後、遂命七九兩連準備應戰、第七連李連長壽彭第九連解連長立道見×人距陣地只有三百多公尺了、立卽下令　始射擊、遂把×人打了個洗流嘩啦、同時第七連第一排賀排長理、九連第一排馬排長景　、各挑選奮勇十斤幾　出擊、用手榴彈投炸×人、當時×人傷亡的很多、並獻得×人宮島旗子一面、×遂用猛烈火力反攻、不得巳退囘原陣地、結果七連李連長壽彭九連張排長長勝受傷、死傷士兵二十幾名、</p>
<p>問、李連長怎麽受的傷、</p>
<p>答、因爲×人佔了薛村溝、用砲兵射擊郭家岔地後面、×人騎兵百除明向我陣地衝　、李連長因之左眼　邊受傷、遂將部隊稍向後撤、准入新陣地</p>
<p>問、人用砲火打擊的這樣利害、第三營爲什麽不撤退呢、</p>
<p>答、因爲×人幾面包圍、　不出去了、營長和營附（張紹宗）曾親自率領八九兩連　了好幾次沒有成功、結果張營附陳亡、（在邵村衷莊東北高地後）</p>
<p>問、還得到些什么戰利品呢？</p>
<p>答、還有第七連陳排長作霖得到×人的輕機槍步槍和　盔大子彈等、因爲營畏命他襲擊×人右側背、他由那凹道內過去、×人不知這、給他一個出其不意</p>
<p>問、山門莊那一方面×人就沒有攻擊囑、是那一連在那裏守防、</p>
<p>答、山門莊是第八連兩排人在那裏、因爲　村的保安軍在邵村那裏和×人打了一氣、×人沒有淮來、只用砲兵射擊、但邵村及上郭村一帶×人、兵力均非常雄厚、在山下邊的×人是守勢、其餘通是後面來了、</p>
<p>問、第一營在什麽地方呢、</p>
<p>答、第一營在文村柳林莊一帶陣地伏擊×人、</p>
<p>問、第二營呢、</p>
<p>答、第二營在漢師村首先開始和×人接觸的就是第五連、第四連在師村溝陣地伏擊×人、第六連在楊家嶺陣地伏擊×人、</p>
<p>問、總計這次戰役、×人傷亡多少、我們傷亡多少、</p>
<p>答、×人死了砲兵上校一、（在八將門）牛島司令一、（在三營陣地前）其餘官兵共計死傷三四百名、我團死了長官一（張營附紹宗）士兵二十餘名、受傷長官二、士兵十餘名、以三營為最多、</p>
<p>問：聽說這次戰役徐旅畏也陣亡了、徐旅長是怎樣陣亡的、</p>
<p>答：聽說×人佔了溝西莊、旅長遂親自帶領衛隊趕到八將門督戰、被×人砲彈炸死了、同時衛隊連連長也陣亡、</p>
<p>這次戰役我們的損失也是很大、但是弟兄們　越打越起勁、大家抱定决心、把日本×子趕出中國去、</p>
<p>上操號響了、我叫他上操去、則停止了談話、</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦七日電】路透社外交訪員稱、德意此次之締結政治軍事同盟、以表現軸心國的關係一舉、此閒　不感覺驚異、但官方以同盟之詳細內容尙未獲悉、故暫時保留批評、然吾人必須記憶者、卽在相當期內、德意關係會成爲德意兩國政治家最喜提論之問題、德意此次公報之語調、似專爲制止所謂意國不滿於德國政策之謠言者、但從另一方面觀察、設若一般意國人民均不滿於現存之德意聯繫者、則同盟之締結、適足以顯示其不滿之心情而巳云、倫敦之觀察者、對於該同盟、認爲係於德意關係中確定德國之軍事立場、外交界則正討論兩點、（一）在某種場合下意國可能的中立之影響、（二）德國對地中海及北非之關係、</p>

<p>【美聯社華盛頓七日電】此間外交家臆測、德、意軍事同盟或將使日本處於孤立地位、而被迫向西方民主國家推求較爲密切之關係、貿易專家深知日本之貿易、依賴於英美者極鉅、認爲日本在經濟上乃最易侵襲者、據統計數字之表示、一九三七年、日本戰時所需之百分之七十二、係自英美輸入、自德　　入者、僅百分之四、自意國輸入者更少、可予忽視、參議院金氏稱、德、意訂立軍事同盟之目的、縱非稱覇世界、必爲征　歐洲云、</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>教部取締政治性特種學校</h3>
<p>昨天大公晚報刊載重慶航訊，說敎胄部已分令各省敎育廳各級學校及其他各有關方面，取缔政治性特種學校，我們認爲這個消息値得重視：第一因爲目前抗戰建國運動轉入新的艱苦階段，我們要克服新的困難爭取最後勝利，必須使？國敎育事業一致爲抗戰建國事業而服務，其有違反這一最高原則的，自然應該加以取締，第二，員前日本侵華正在步步進入困難與失敗之境，他們爲要挽救其前途的危機，正在加緊推進其政治的陰謀。×××等漢奸賣國賊，正在永種種方法到文化界尤其是敎育界裏去傳播其「反共和平」等降×　國的理論與活動，這種活觔巳在海外華僑，淪陷地區甚至還存在於後方各地，因此對於此種敎育組繳的取缔也是必要了—</p>
<p>不過我們認爲，第一，僅憑一紙訓令的取缔是不會有什麽重要効力的—我們一面還要進行廣泛的宣傳解釋工作，動員　衆的力量，進行堅韌的鬥爭，其次，同時　要積極地鼓勵一切不違反革命的三民主義的最高原則而以爲抗戰建國服務的敎育機關，積極地鞏固和擴展道種國立公立的敎育機關。抗戰以來，陝日　邊區的抗日軍政大學和陜北公學，曾經遵照革命的三民主義的最高原朋，爲適應服務抗戰建議的迫急需要，曾經先後爲國家民族培養了成千成　的靑年幹部人才，二次二次以至五六次地補充前綫，深入×後及服務後方，二年來，對於中華民族解放事業，盡了最大的力量。我們希望政府當局對於這種學校及相類的敎育機關，應該不分黨派，不分民挨的，一予以統一的指導與領導，予以切實的支持與濟助。如果我們在取締漢奸親日派之時不同時扶助這種抗戰建國的敎育事　，固然將不能收獲應有的效果，如果僅以「未經核准」的理由而廣泛地取締一切『政治性的特種學校』而甚至容許漢奸賣國賊在『業經核准』的學府中進行陰謀，那我們沒有話講，只有抗議了！爲了抗戰建國前途，我們不能不要求政府切實注意及此！</p>
<h3>國際現勢縱橫談（續）</h3>
<p>— 廖崇聖</p>
<p>不寧唯是，蘇俄對於世界和平之貢獻，更有大於消極之容忍者。去歲當捷克危機日形尖銳化性，蘇聯爲實踐其條約義務起見，特於九月廿一日由李維諾夫宣稱：「蘇聯軍事當局，鑒於目前之形勞，準備立刻與法，捷之軍事領袖接商，以考　應卽採取之步驟」。迫　尼黑協定簽訂之夕，李維諾夫復鄭重警告列強曰：「國聯精神，不應於目前避免二和戰尙在未知之數的危機，而招致一必然的大戰於他日」！於重申該國之嚴正立場時更謂：「蘇聯對於此類政治（意指犧牲弱國，以退讓而求苟安者）之禾肯苟同。深覺榮幸，且將來亦無違背其此毬政策之意向。蓋彼深信在現目之形勢下，捨此途徑（卽集體變全），决不能保證眞正之和平。蘇聯所期待於列强者，不外重　於此　一之途徑耳」，觀此，則條聯態度之堅决，可謂瞭如指掌矣。</p>
<p>四，波蘭及羅馬尼亞外交之轉向</p>
<p>波，羅界乎蘇俄與西歐之間，戰後爲防禦蘇聯計，彼此曾締結同盟。是今日西歐民主國家與蘇聯之接近，波；羅不啻爲地理及政治上之一大關鍵。而其外交動向自屬不容忽略者。</p>
<p>波蘭外交，在外長柏克領導下，素以『騎牆』見稱。比年以來，因法國在東南歐之勢力日就衰弱，於是不惜與德國狼狽爲奸，以償其併呑煤　　富及爲鐵路，公路交通樞紐之捷　德申城之宿願，贊完成其波，匈接壤之好夢。五年前德，波不侵犯條約之締結，卽肇互相友好之始　。然而，好景難常，慕尼黑會議後，席捲德申之願雖　，接壤之念未遂，而波蘭本身已淪爲德國東　之禁　矣。亡羊補　。柏克之外交方針遂呈顚著之轉變。去歲十一月廿六日波、　不優犯協定之重訂，是爲其轉向之始。當時波蘭舉國輿論莫不一致稱許，卽素主反共之極右報紙，亦認此舉爲「合時與重要」。至於該國外交部半官式之言論機關（Kuryer　Krakqwski）於評論烏克蘭問題時，更謂一德國已利用盧森尼亞爲其指揮反蘇，波活動之根據，惟時至今日，德國及烏克蘭人均須澈底明暸。如以島克蘭問題爲反蘇、反波之藉口，結果適足以使蘇、波之間益事諒解耳」。</p>
<p>德國　於波蘭態度突　，以對波仍須利用，特於本年元月廿五日遺其外長里賓　羅甫報聘華沙。經兩日之詳談，波蘭當局雖稱談判備極「滿意」彼此之『疑雲盡消』，實則柏克外長之態度意外强硬，舉凡德方所請，如但澤自由市之冉度退讓，及由德國築一公路橫越北波之波美尼亞省等，一一均遭拒絕。且也，德外長所負之重要使命，乃在探詢如德，意壓迫西歐，波蘭將取之態度若何。誠以德國渴望波蘭維持中立之原因有二：（一）使波蘭不致履行法，波盟約而攻德之背：（二）如史塔林履行法，蘇互助協定時，波蘭之中立，可阻　俄假道援法，惟柏克對此則拒絕提供任何保證，並　决聲明波蘭必　保留其便宜行事之權，以便事到臨頭時，視其自身利益之所在，而作最後之决定焉，</p>
<p>波蘭態度旣如上述，同病相　之羅馬尼亞，自難讓其獨美於前。爲調整兩國之陣容計，羅外長加芬科特於本年三月初報聘華沙。經三日商談之結果，加芬科對於波，匈接讓之議表示諒解，並認　國利用降服之捷克及納粹化之盧森尼亞爲進迫羅馬尼亞之根據一舉，其隱憂實倍於匈牙利要求修改條約之野心。爲未雨調繆計，雙方遂同意：（一）對於巴爾幹及多瑙河諸區或採取「更爲積極」之政策，（二）開掘運　，展染公路，使波羅的海與　海相連接。（按此項計劃，擬將維斯杜拉（Vistula），聶斯德（Dniester），普盧特（Pruth）及多瑙諸水溝通一氣，其經濟，政治，軍略上之意義均甚重大也。三）時至今日，波，羅兩國實　再事疑慮蘇俄存心侵略之理由，反之，此後對俄，於政治及經濟上均應採　更爲友好之態度。</p>
<p>五，希特勒果不惜於一戰乎？</p>
<p>民主國家之結合，原在維持國際秩序，消弭戰爭於無形，初非故予　裁國家以難堪者。是今日之和戰，實僅擊於獨裁者，尤其希特勒之一念。而就現實之立場言，和戰之取捨又當以其國力之盈虛以爲斷。比年以來，德國以戰時統制經濟方式，動員全國之人力、財力，物力，積極擴軍。其陸空軍之設備，於若干方面，容或略勝英，法。况且，　尼黑會議前之捷克，其兵力可以牽制德軍四十師之衆。今則此項大軍自可移作別用。以言兵員。卽令波希米亞及摩拉維亞之捷克民族不足靠，而蘇台德區三百五十萬人口中，尙有曾經軍訓之壯丁三十萬衆，供其驅策。是其兵力增强殆已絕無疑義。</p>
<p>夫兵力之充實。器械之優良，固爲戰爭主要條件之一：惟在國力戰之原則下，糧食、原料，與財力三者，尤爲决勝之最後關鍵，此殆人憲皆知者。</p>
<p>就糧食言，今之德國與歐戰時無甚差異所仰給於外來者，約佔全國消費總額五分之一。自吞併捷克後，因與匈牙利，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞等農業國家相接近之故，其糧食恐慌固巳大减。惟上言區域，歐戰時亦多在德　、握之中，第以戰事影響，生產减縮，終亦未能供應德與之充分需求。準是以觀，今日德國之糧問題、仍不得視爲根本解决，無怪其觀覦烏克蘭之心，日益迫切也。</p>

<h3>爲各界賬聯會全義務籌欵　中救劇團定期公演　中華業餘學交昨晚歡迎『中救』幷獻旗</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團，自準備出國宣傳抵港後，「歡迎」『聯歡』的高潮汹湧了起來。戲劇呢？即因爲他們的慎重籌備，還未能和我們見面。『趕快公演吧！』『趕快公演吧！』很多人都是這樣懇切地期待着。</p>
<p>月來，「中救」朋友們一面籌備出國手續，一面排演新劇，牛活的緊張，工作的努力，還繼續着過去在戰地服務的精神。他們出國的時間，預定在下月初旬；公演呢？亦已經有了端倪了。這是讀者所樂聽的吧！</p>
<p>現　香港各　賑　難民聯席會因崇仰該團過去在國內工作的卓著的成績，和精神的戲劇藝術，爲擴大救亡官傳及籌欵賑濟傷兵難民起見，特議决敦請該團於出國前爲該會作一次大規模的義演經已派員徵得該團的同意　同時　舉中國新聞記者公會主　這次的演出，　推舉四婦女聯會華商總會，鐘聲慈善社、中華藝協會等組織義演特委會，專責辦理。咋天下午，假座　者公會舉行第一次會議，到委員李建豐，劉慶菅，盡國棉，陸　，李伯劻，　飛絮，姚尚芹，黎少明等十餘人，并請中國救亡劇團團長金山先生和林樞先生列席參加。經過了詳細的討論，大要决定：一，公演時間：本月廿五，廿六·廿七，一連三晚。二，公演劇目：第一晚演「保衛祖國』，第二晚「民族萬歲」第三晚「臺兒莊的春天」三，關價：分一毛，五毛，一元，二元，三元，五種，（四）劇本呈送華民習審查，請救亡劇團，將劇本于三日內送會，（五）　眼聯會先撥支本特委會演劇什費港幣三百元。（四）請鐘聲慈善社盧國棉先生，辦理請谿免娛樂稅。（五）義演宣傳事項：新聞宣傳由裝飛絮君負責，特刊及文字，美術，印刷宣傳事項，由陸浮君負責。</p>
<p>目　，中國救亡劇團除積極排演各偉大名劇外，現已着手　製宏偉的佈景和燈光。相信這次的演出，其意義的重大，藝術的精鍊，佈景的偉大，燈光的奇妙，將可以打破任何劇團的演出紀錄。尤其值得重視的，這次公演，除院租外，一切佈景，裝置演出費用，概由該團負担，聽說單　景一項，已達二千餘元，這更是本港戲劇界空前的有意義的盛舉。</p>
<p>關於該團的動態及影響，還有一種値得報道的：</p>
<p>咋晚十時半。中華業　學咬歡迎中救劇團聯歡會除了熱烈之外，作風亦頗不凡。</p>
<p>校長吳涵真致詞表示敬意後，教務主任方與嚴說，中救劇團目的是「救亡」與「救國」，我們在信裏所學習的，亦是「救亡」與「救國」。所以我們要携手起來，站在一起親愛地友誼聯歡。</p>
<p>方先牛還　重地說：</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團値得我們學習的有這幾點助勉全體同學：</p>
<p>（一）高度熱情；（二）硬幹，快幹，切實幹；（三　同志，道同，行動同；（四）寄生命于事業上；（五）在抗戰建國中生長；（六）拜工農士兵大衆做先生；（七）國家至上，民族至上。。</p>
<p>這是　校實踐生活教育的一課。這作風，這精神，不消說是值得我們敬仰的。</p>
<p>接着，吳校長代表全校員生献旗。在熱烈掌聲中，金先生代表該團接受，旗是　緞白字，壯麗堂皇，題着『喚起高度熱情，聯合搶救祖國。』</p>
<p>正副團長金山王瑩的演說，態度誠懇，內容　動，使人聽了非常興奮。</p>
<p>因爲節目還多，時間不够，林樞團長及該團幾位朋友另約定時間演講。座談會接着開始，題目是：「怎樣把現實的作品搬上舞台。」這是該校同學在學習中喚起的，個課題，以集體主義的自我敎育，作爲生活教育的方法，這作風是很値得提倡的。尤其是在香港。熱烈的座談會之後，還繼之以助興。他們互相感動，互相舉習，彼此都要在抗戰建國生中長起來！</p>

<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>中央攝影塲首次公演　國防劇「戰鬥」　章泯編劇趙丹導演主演者白楊顧而已</h3>
<p>【重慶通訊】中國歷史上從來所未有的抗戰　發以後、一向作爲電影戲劇　站的上海、許許多多人、都馬上離開這堆方、投奔到內地去、在這廿二個月中閒、這些劇運工作者、深入戰區及鄉村、使一般比較滯鈍的農村及老百姓、都通過了戲劇的橋樑、而和抗戰配合起來。</p>
<p>記得金山會經寫過一篇戰時劇　通訊、他就說、有當地一個鄉紳、他擁有很多槍枝及武裝農民、他是、他對這次抗戰并沒有表示、於是他們演戲時、（一　激動救亡的戲劇）、就請這位紳士去看、當戲看過以後、那位神士很感動地站起來、堅决地表示、他决以全力來打擊侵略者、以這個小小的例子、可以看出救亡戲劇、它所負的任務、是怎樣的偉大了、</p>
<p>這批電影戲劇工作者、除了王獻齋、　稼晨、孫敏、湯傑、徐辛園等已回滬以外、其餘如藍蘋、李琳、左明都在陝北延安、從事劇運工作、金山、王瑩、蔡楚生、費穆、歐陽予情、則留在香港、繼續製片、</p>
<p>上海一般大導演、如應雲術、史東山、洪深、則鄰在重慶、而許多上海著名的演員、大都已加入中央攝影場、這一個以上海導演、演員爲中心的中央攝影場、在一年中間、已經　製了許多抗戰新聞片及以抗戰為題材的影片、</p>
<p>最近、中央攝影場全體同人、又籌備了一次大規模的公演、演出人員陣容的整齊、是內地演出中少見的、而且這中間、大多數是上海的熟人、</p>
<p>這次公演的戲劇、是一　五幕國防衛、名字是呌『戰　』、編劇者是過去爲業餘實驗劇團導演過『羅察歐與朱麗葉』『大雷雨』等的導演人章泯、負責導演的、却是上海聞各的小生趙丹、「舞台監督」是以演『狂歡之夜』縣老爺蜚聲銀增的顧而已、以及『業餘』燈光打得最好的朱今明、</p>
<p>至於演員、更多大家熟稔的演員、如白楊、旅超、魏鶴齡、顧而已、綫千里等及中央攝影場全體演員、公演的的戲院、是國泰大戲院、我們雖然沒有看見這次演出、但一定可以想見、公演的熱烈時及成功的、</p>
<h3>好萊塢　影星代表作　續</h3>
<p>瑪淋黛德麗許　劉別廉之『欲望』及墨穆林之『戀歌』均値得我人一再留戀者、在情感方面、則「戀歌」勝『欲望』多矣、</p>
<p>洛　泰楊　洛麗泰楊　有彩片古裝片若干部、然胥不逮專演喜劇爲佳、在洛麗泰之喜劇中、自以『左擁右抱』爲最出色、</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白無疑、『傾國傾城』爲克勞黛之榮譽作、</p>
<p>凱絲玲　本　凱絲玲最合個性者爲『小婦人』『名門街』兩片、在成績比較上、後者似較前者尤爲動人、</p>
<p>茂鄉洛埃　茂　之『大偵探聶克』及『石榴裙熱』均有美妙之演出、</p>
<p>薜爾維　納　影迷均深知『蝴雜夫人』為薛爾維之不朽作、然『同命鴛鴦』一片亦不弱、</p>
<p>愛麗絲費　以片段言、『小紅娘』中愛麗絲有極卓越之演出、主演作品中、則當推『樂付滄桑』一片、</p>
<p>宋雅海妮　宋雅之溜冰藝術當以『銀宮歌舞』最爲人稱頌、</p>
<p>梅兒奧白朗　在美爲『學校風光』『牛郎織女』、在英爲「繁華世界」、</p>
<p>琴述羅吉絲　舞片首推「楊柳春風」、演片則推「名門街」、</p>

<h3>丈夫，妻子，朋友　（六）</h3>
<p>密司卡伐就說道：「那末你怎麼不到度斯脫寓所來看我？」</p>
<p>里奧拿遲疑了一下，說，『好，我馬上就來』。</p>
<p>談過幾句閒話之後，密司伐卡便把實情告訴他，陶麗絲的唱歌聲音雖然不錯，但不是什麼了不起的。下午音樂會中受到大衆喝采，不過是認識的朋友故意捧場而已。</p>
<p>卡伐後來說，「你們兩人階級是相差了些。她屈就　　了你，其實她是個社會上的女子。她現在又要把音樂來當作她的事業。這使你是非常恐惶了。你是不願意她郝　的，是嗎？」</p>
<p>里矣拿想苦地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「可是她却正不肯放　呢，」跑說着，看了看手錶立起身來。「我要去預備我自己的音樂會了——令晚上我到要美國義勇軍大會去歌唱」。當握她了里奧拿的手，她就走近他抬是望着他的臉，這種强有力暗示是很明顯的。</p>
<p>『我可以接吻她嗎？』里奧拿暗自這麼想。「她是那麼可愛」，這時候們給突地響了起來。</p>
<p>一個小宣傳進一封信來。密司卡伐閱讀時，臉上露出不悅。「唉，他們特則要我今晚唱首軍歌。歌內的字句我已記不得。現在我沒有方法知道——一位朋友已出城了。這首歌是他們海軍中唱的——關於一艘驅逐艦。」</p>
<p>里奧拿說：「啊，就是那支歌！」</p>
<p>「你知道的嗎？」密司卡伐高典起來了。</p>
<p>「自然，我是大戰時的水兵啊」。</p>
<p>密司卞伐走到鋼琴邊彈了一響。里奧拿帶着資唱戲，「我來唱給你聽。「於是他就唱起來了。可是唱不到一句，忽又停止。「且慢，要我這　唱是唱不出的，我只會躱在浴室裏唱。浴室在那裏？』卡伐指了給他，好奇的望着他。他却走了進去。她跟到門邊。他吸足一口氣，就放開喉嚨高唱起來。</p>
<p>唱不滿一句，臉盆架上一只杯子跌下來碎了。他停止了唱歌，不安地道歉說，「唉，我眞對不起！我老是過着這搜事。」一邊他拾起地下的碎片。</p>
<p>密司卡伐問，「你說這事以前也發生過嗎？」</p>
<p>「發生過兩次。」</p>
<p>她像是做夢的走到琴邊彈了一個音說，「唱，唱得響」。</p>
<p>『好，可是如果鏡子也跌下來，那却不能怪我』。於是他又唱了起來。（未完）</p>

<h3>草地綱球單打決賽　徐煒培暗聯冠軍　三比二壓倒弟弟培　小徐演出甚佳祗以藝遜一籌卒遭敗績</h3>
<p>……全港公開革地網球單打决費、咋日下午四時三刻、在香港木球會場舉行、爲徐家昆仲共同爭標、故誰得誰失、似經關痛癢、總而言之、他兄弟包辦冠亞兩軍就是了、</p>
<p>……在爭戰中、小徐認眞努力、一些不肯茍且、大刀闊斧、猛向其兄弱點抽殺、大有一獲冠軍之雄心、一般觀衆、都覺詫異、至此才明白兩徐者番的得失、并非內定的、</p>
<p>……座上客有港督羅富國爵士、副按察司連素、華人代表羅文　、及周夀臣　耕等、無形中增加競賽者之球興不少、</p>
<p>……徐偉培在是屆競　過程中、連遇勁敵、荊棘滿途、祇以藝高一籌、連下林珍兄弟、抵達决賽、其個人之技術、的是高强、</p>
<p>徐潤培站在另一組競賽中、所遇的多是籍籍無名、因此他的最高水準未嘗演出、到了昨天、才盡量表現出來、正手反手及兩網的技術都恰到好處、同時復以兇險之角度撇搫對付其兄、先得首盆、次三兩盆被哥哥迎頭趕上、反以一比二負、</p>
<p>第四盤大徐浪費非常、擊球不過網、發球又多雙錯誤、乃　成二比二、三比三、四比四、三度平局、及後小徐攔網演出工失、一擘一殺、常中要害、以六此四再得一盤、成二比二之均勢、</p>
<p>第五盤最後決賽中、大徐努力一點、故一氣呵成、以五比一之絕對優勢佔先、惟小徐奮勇追擊、打至四比五、此時局面又緊張赴來、至是大徐不得不小心應戰、幾度上網猛抽、得心應手、卒以六比四得勝、總結果三比二、遂蟬聯兩屆冠軍、</p>
<p>統觀兩人之球藝、大徐較佳、經驗亦好、貴役只演出全力十分之七、故　邊及邊綫落　之好角度、很少見到、攔網一道、亦稍試一二而已、</p>
<h3>台杯綱球賽　德波進入第二週　匈勝羅亦人第二週與南會戰</h3>
<p>【海通社羅京電】匈牙利與羅馬尼亞在羅京舉行之台維斯杯第一週　五場、匈牙利以一對二獲勝、</p>
<p>【海浦社波京電】波蘭與荷蘭在波京舉仃之台維斯杯第一週　五場、波以四對一獲勝、進入第二週、將戰德國</p>
<p>【海通社維也納電】德國與瑞士在維也納舉行之台維斯杯第一週賽五場、德以三對二獲勝、第二戰逢戰波蘭、</p>
<p>【海通社八日維也納電】昨日台杯雙打、德選乎亨克爾與麥特沙斯、以六比二、六比四直；兩盛勝瑞士之菲沙爾及曼尼夫、德遂以三比〇勝　士、得入歐洲帶第二週、與波蘭會戰、</p>
<p>【海通社沙八電電】咋日波蘭選手對荷蘭選手、波連勝兩單打後、以四比一勝荷、進入第二週　賽、遇德國、戰績如下、</p>
<p>【海通社八日柴格當勃電】昨日南　手美德克與潘西克、以直洛三盤勝　爾蘭之難琴士及伊振後、南遂以三〇之比得　人第二週、</p>
<p>【海通社八日不加勒斯電】咋日經劇戰後、匈以三比二僅勝羅馬尼亞、星期六日戰後、匈以二比一領先、昨日單打匈選手加保甩、以六比三、六比八、四比六二比六敗于羅之加拉魯　、但亞斯保（匈）力戰五盤、以一比六、六比二、六比三、六比八、六比二、僅勝史密（羅）、匈　得進第二週戰南斯拉夫、</p>
<p>兩徐最大之弊端、是發「雙錯誤」球、計大徐共計九次、小徐共計八次、假若過着勢均力敵的對手、每會因而失分、不可謂不重要、同时兩徐之發球、亦甚覺鬆馳、不　不易牽制强手、而且不能補助攔網、萬望留意才是、茲將成續列後、</p>

<h3>公開籃球賽　星島勝南華　冠軍如囊中物　賽中發生小錯誤南華將上訴東方力挫鐘聲後忽自行棄權</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）咋天晚上、靑年會健身室裏、舉行兩幕很重要的申組籃球賽、一是半島對南華、一是鐘聲對東方、這四路雄兵、很　巧地同在這　個晚上分別對抗、特別惹人注意、雖提高門票價格、也座上客滿、</p>
<p>六時半開始的是乙組賽、由華雄對爭聲、因彼此實力不相上下、戰時頗可觀、然華雄以進取機會較多、卒以卅四比三十得勝、</p>
<p>次場是關係錦標間題最大的一役、在場看客、十九露出希冀南華勝利的同情、但結果南華卻以廿九比三十一、僅一球之　、給星島所敗、而星島旣得此次勝利、對　軍一席、已視如囊中物了、</p>
<p>在競賽中、均重視聯絡、各自發揮其機巧以取分數、故演成絕對平均的局面、紀錄牌上、常見雙方續分一起一落、每相差不過一三分之間、則戰情之緊張、可想而知、</p>
<p>每得球到手的一方、便把握着前進取分的機會、而此種戰略、唯一重要條件乃得　到手、球到手便是自己的出路、所以很少見到面擊的動作、所需要衝擊的、祇在於籃底爭球時、看詎勝此一着、</p>
<p>全賽過程、南華所得射籃機會、比星島略多、祇是左右角度的斜射、每不中鵠、而其所得罰射機會亦多、亦每投多不中、　如罰射有準、勝利或不會被星日攫去的、我認爲、南華之敗、非技術不如人、最壞處是輕失了罰射機會、而石振智表　失常態、亦救敗原因之一、</p>
<p>南華各員跳球、也多輸星島一着、還有一點、是　擊不得力、每見其進攻投擲之球中板擊下時、絕少見另一己方球員向進至籃場以何機會、故球學下時、總被星鳥守將奪去、反之、星島則不然、所以籃底爭奪常收效、</p>
<p>星島各員演出、不及戰東方時精彩、此由於南華的妙美戰略、足以控　對方、惟南華雖控制得來、而仍先甚機會、野遭敗績、的是可惜、</p>
<p>比賽中間、有一次星島投人一球、而此球未發動射人之先、　錄台上忽然嗚笛、但裁判員未有跟着鳴笛暫停、星島乃得於此時間內射進一只、惟事情眞湊功、星島僅以卅一比廿九得勝、超過祇一球、因此、事後南華提出質問、認爲當時裁判員未　奮陽笛暫停爲不合、聲稱上訴、故將來如何、且看下囘分解、</p>
<p>尾場東方對鐘聲、識者咸以爲必有一番劇戰、但鐘聲各員表演大失常態、致成一面倒之局、陳汝止雖力圖掙扎、惟被東方陳索祺釘住、欲逞不得、郭植鴻更失衆望、</p>
<p>東方有黃鼎芬、孫寶慶未出場、然馮念華、徐亨、羅吉安等、演出殊　精彩、常聘馳於敵籃底、未通者何之抵抗、各人聯絡、亦見工夫、故在上半場已以三十六此十六佔先、</p>
<p>下半場時、鑲聲革　多領、有氣呑河岳之勢、一陣猛攻、奪回多分、扶搖直上而東方亦於反攻中、奉還數球、厮殺極形慘烈、時桓芬、瑞慶、忽因爭奪來球、遂兩相撞、結果相芬頭破血流瑞麼則　轉量於　上、良久始復甦、後戰至離完場五分鐘前、東方仍五十三比　十二佔先、但東方忽對裁判宣稱棄權、讓鐘聲獲勝、茲將星南之戰成績列下（太歲）</p>

<h3>香港足球陰班師　今晨可抵步</h3>
<p>— （本報專訊）</p>
<p>番港埠際足球隊、於上月廿八日出發　菲、軍容甚盛、我們都以爲雄師所指、必傳捷報、此行可得良好的牧獲、似屬意中事、又鑑於春初菲隊來港時、三戰三北、技術水準不及港方、是衆目共覩的事實、所以我們認爲壯囘港隊赴菲報騁、對勝利可不成問題的、</p>
<p>怎曉得港隊出帥不利、竟連遭出人意料之外的敗續、第一戰對菲埠際隊正式賽及第　戰對喇沙大學隊表演賽、均以一比三喪師、其致敗原因、已見前報記載、乃天時地利人和有關、這亦是爲客軍的吃虧之處、還幸第三戰以四比一擊敗YCO隊、不致全軍　墨、扳回一點體血、</p>
<p>港隊已於昨天離菲北返、所乘的是太平號輪船、計程令天上午十時半可抵埗、足球總會將個一小　、專　迎接、</p>
<p>香港的足球、稱覇還東已久、惟近年來南洋一帶的球隊、均有極顯著的進步、以比香港、幾有後來居上之概、故香港的足球界、刻下不應自視太高、若想保持那超然的地位、今後非加倍努力不可、（太歲）</p>

<h3>五月的話</h3>
<p>— 秋縣</p>
<p>石榴花開，五月了。</p>
<p>五月，血腥的五月，多難的五月，深深地給我們刻印了一條××的烙痕，在我們的心坎播下了鬥爭的種子！</p>
<p>五三，五四，五七，五九，五卅。</p>
<p>×××××××××××××××××××××××！×××××××××××××××××××××××！</p>
<p>××，×××××××××××××××，××恥</p>
<p>一年復一年地，我們是沈獸地過着日子；讓苦痛與仇恨咬嚙着我們的心靈，終於到了這一天，像火山般爆發了</p>
<p>爲了生存，爲了自由，更爲了人類的正義，我們是堅强地站起來了，舉起了反抗的拳頭，以打擊來答覆打擊！誰說我是馴服的羔羊，誰說『　獅』不會奮起怒吼！</p>
<p>狂風擲起了原野的咆哮，全世界也搖動了，中國在爭鬥着。</p>
<p>而今又是五月了，中國各地正展開了劇烈的戰爭；多少田園廬舍在炮火下摧燬了，多少同胞任砲火下死亡，流浪。然而，誰也沒有哀怨，沒有沮喪！每個人都抱着創痛的情緒，爲了組國而站在抗戰的崗哨上。</p>
<p>是的，爲了祖國，我們不再猶豫，徬徨；自由的花雖然美麗，</p>
<p>五月，再不是恥辱的五月了，　　　　　　，戰鬥的五月，光榮的五月！</p>
<p>在戰鬥的五月的到來的時候，讓我們來大聲歌唱吧！</p>
<p>『………………××××××××，××××××××，××××××××！……………………』</p>
<h3>山花</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>在深邃的山谷中，茁放了許多無名的野花，紅的，熱情的願色；閃耀着生命的光輝。</p>
<p>山谷，深選的，寂寞的荒凉的，很少有人跡·</p>
<p>封鎖着一段悠長的歲月，平靜的，騷擾的。賽會的鑼聲，塘閒的蛙響，豆棚下的晚　，荷鋤時的呼喚，窮巷的牛羊，新春的　鼓；如是居諸的華月與流年，山谷中的野花，命看着我們，默默地，給我們記下了。</p>
<p>花開又芥落，在山谷中，流過了年年的春秋。山花是欣喜的。</p>
<p>衝破靜謐的氛圍，不知歲月的山野之夢。人與野獸間生一次巨大的急變。抵抗野獸的侵凌，人乃與獸搏鬥。爲了這搏門，有許多勇士流盡鮮紅的血。毀傷了肢體，抑或貢献了全部生命。勇士的血流下了，山花染成紅色。</p>
<p>地下長埋了白骨與靑燐，馬上的　韶。大漠的風雲，蒼蒼的古戍，在芳草竿苹時，確然你已無法覓得思戀之憑藉。但我們殊可于山谷中，戰塲上，任意拾起了一二朶股紅的山花，性命的等閒，頭頗的輕擲，使你可了然星辰的不死，日月的長存。魂來楓林靑，魂返關山黑，生的茶火，不消失，也不模糊。展開了自由的歡笑，温暖這無情的山谷，使我們永不忘記，這地上曾流過血：熱情的紅，豪邁的紅，絢爛的紅，給我們以奮與，以安慰，以鼓舞，以鞭策。</p>
<p>吹滿山谷，這腥風。生命窒息了。</p>
<p>唯有山花，猶兀然挺立於醜惡的山谷，密密的荊榛叢中。</p>
<p>風十分腥臭，說明野獸的猖狂。勇士流下他們的血，很巧妙的把牠們夾作一種灌漑，培植成自由的花朶，還把他們染成紅色。</p>
<p>人與獸的鬥爭中，有許多勇士愛植他們的花朶。撤下新生的種子，年復一年，山地簇簇地開放了，不祇在山谷中，也走下低原與平隰。曙色興曉風，吹開天地的腥腐。每一朶花，展開自由的羽翼。</p>
<p>沒有腥風了。透露山花的淸新，宇宙間一片晴光與淑氣。</p>
<p>千千萬萬年的滄桑，換了花信的春風，小樓一夜來春雨，明朝便聽賣杏花聲，說不定海也枯，石也爛了的時候，山花終於依然：不枯，不黃，也不殘敗。不是徼倖的偶然呵。你說，這山花，不，你該說勇士的靈魂，自由的啓蒙者，這不比那些平凡的花啊！</p>
<p>結束了殘餘的犬羊。給我們以幸福的亨受，凡有山花處，皆萌芽了自由。</p>
<p>萌芽了自由，在我們誠然是幸福了，但我們不能忘記辛苦憔悴的園丁呵。</p>
<p>該謝謝他們血的裁培！</p>
<h3>日本經濟的犯罪病態</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>崩漬是病的結果，病在腑臟的時候，是常人的眼光看不到的，不過病日加深，病態便逐漸表現出來，我們預料日本的主旨，對華的戰爭，要『速戰速决』，一持久了，便有經濟崩潰的禍息，自從蘆溝橋發難以來，將近兩年了，究竟日本的經濟到什麼地步，就日本報紙的紀載看來，大藏大臣演說最近募的公債八十一億，只有五億可以把捐稅來抵補，其餘要把日本人民的儲蓄金來充用。那儲蓄金是國民的膏血，拿國民的膏血來變成榮彈，那是最後的一着，去經濟崩潰不遠了。</p>
<p>還有日本實施經濟統制規定而後，已經一年了，他們国民的認識不深，所以違反的越發衆多，據牠司法省刑事局的調查，去年六月起至本年二月止，全國遠反的有一萬三千五百八十一人，其中起訴的，東京五百七中九人，大阪五百十人，此外有三千一百五十人，最近累犯者有漸次增加的傾向司法省當局以爲這是誤於向持的溫情主義，應該改變方法，而對於違返者採嚴訓主義。數日前松本刑事局長，發指令給全國各檢事局說，兩後處分這種案件，酌量案情的狀况，而處以體刑與罰金刑，但以　金為主，任何法令，犯的人太多了，那法令的效　也將等於零。日本經濟的崩價，究竟在什麼時候？照上述的情形看來，怕是不很遠了！</p>
<p>且說在華的日本人，很借勢力，發他國難財的，實不少，或借軍部的護照運翰物品，或勾結一般奸商，經營那不明不白的商業，這穗墮落的怪象，從前在日本國裏，却是不看見，不聽聞的。現在這種事實，下但耳閒，並且目見，日本民族性的墮落，國家社會公共經濟長崩潰。可從這民族性的病態中看出發來了。</p>
<h3>精神與物質</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>老早就是這麼一回事，西方談的是物質，東方的中國，談的是精神。</p>
<p>戊戌政變，維新運動抬頭，朝野爭言洋務洋務。洋洋盈耳，雖然那時候維新守奮兩派各有公婆的一番道理，然而棄精紳取物質，多少總有點異樣的傾向。</p>
<p>歷史一向具備因果的條件，一件事的不容片面提出來，作一個單純的解答，正像抽刀斬水一樣的難。</p>
<p>這幾十年來的歐風美雨濡染得中國人穿長衫着西裝袴。……</p>
<p>算了！你來！</p>
<p>一張法西斯獨裁者怪猙獰的面孔，一尊大砲，一列機關槍，開聞的還不毒　呢！殺人不眨眼的，自然囉，上有飛機炸彈，下有裝甲車和坦克。物質物質！殺人要自已東緊袴腰帶的，一片麪包中政府通過，發下命令，不能多咬一口，白塌休要想白白　塌，分配論塗改了好幾次，结果仍舊一張廢紙。</p>
<p>中國有中國的歷史，說起來本來是好的。不過天禍　族的淸朝，橫的壓士氣，直的壓士氣，想出種種方法來摧殘士氣。弄得舉國死氣沉沉，以爲帝皇萬世之業，這回總辦妥當了。然而羽翎軍沒有用，神拳的神還在九天玄妙之上，一時不肯下凡，於是開門揖維新，請物質先生來帮助，物質擾一了　之後，精神更加困頓，一直到目前，精神脫鈞，釣上來一些膚淺的物質，「人之身體，就成死物」，「學者以多方喪生，大道以歧路亡羊」。</p>
<p>現在，舊賬一筆鈞銷，軍新喚起精神！太阿可以倒持，授納給人，毛瑟槍也靠不住的，因為打敵人，也可給敵人保駕，所以孫中山先生論到武器的使用，全在人的精紳，曾說：「兩者相較，精神力量居其九，物質力量居其一」，運用物質要有「權」！</p>
<p>事實告訴告人，目前當某種人物的，從年齡分類上看起來，最多是五六十歲的人，爲什麽五六十歲的人特別多呢，難道他們生下來就是一副奸量不成，這是受了淸朝壓迫士氣的餘毒，少壯時，便是「死物」，他們根本沒有精神，所以疑古玄同主張「一過四十歲卽須槍斃」乏說，言出有因，不是瞎說。</p>
<p>基於這樣的論斷，我們可以浮一大白，歡呼起舞而言曰：「某種人物的淘汰是時間問題，他們在精神上自己宣告死刑，不値一按。」</p>
<p>爲了時代的嚴重，我們得送往廢物，也不能不迎來新的精神。所謂新精神，就是此時此地不究或缺的而爲人類要求生存的精神，精神是士氣，是朝氣，是生氣，是無形的力量。因此：</p>
<p>我們的精神，要跟着戰時進行，做到確實的進步：過去精神上的缺點，要在抗戰中洗滌乾凈：有職的盡職：有能力的盡能力：生活要嚴肅要緊張：前方和後方，確實做到同仇敵愾，休戚相關，言行，表裏一致，結集到「國家主上，民族全上，軍軍第一，勝利第一」的目標下；不搖不奪，下欺，不偽，不趁火打刦，把一般社會生活　　戰時的條件。</p>
<p>這些能够件件做到，那未，一份物質就可以當十份物質來使用。</p>
<h3>山城</h3>
<p>— 茜菲</p>
<p>灰暗的天，籠罩着灰暗的城市，小點兒的雪花，輕飄飄的飛下來，山頭，像蓋上一層白霧。今天是墟期了，天氣却這機冷，怕不會熱鬧吧？</p>
<p>可是，當我們走出大街上，城門外，壚市正熱鬧地，一片喧聲夾雜着人的呵氣，風吹着，人的身體冷顫着，聲調跟口裏呵出來的氣抖顫起來。</p>
<p>解下馱馬背上的重負，把辛苦的收穫搬進城裏來賣：紅米，豌豆，高梁。趁市的人在賣者人叢中穿來穿去。</p>
<p>「價格高了。糧食漲了價。」每個人鄱這樣說。</p>
<p>「不是麽，從前八塊錢舊幣一斗的米，現在賣到十四塊。」賣雞蛋的把話頭搭過來。</p>
<p>鷄蛋也漲價了：從二毫錢漲到四角。</p>
<p>椰菜花，鉤藤，馬鈴薯，擺在　傍；可是通通都漲價了。</p>
<p>『爲什麼？』</p>
<p>「人太多啊！」賣糧食的這麼說。因爲戰爭，南方許多人跑到這西南的一角。尤其是中大搬進來，給這小縣城平空增加了十分之一的人口，干是感到人太多了。貧苦的繃着臉兒。對我們用厭惡的眼釘視着。但也有暗自歡喜的，物賈任意最高，腰包也就漲滿得快。</p>
<p>太陽還是躱在雲層裏，鉛灰的天，覆蓋着灰色的人群——在燒着的乾草牛　火旁國洪取暖，一面吃着裝在口袋裏的紅米飯。他們很少有棉換穿着的。可是，沒有也罷，他們的所謂棉襖，最　已荷負了三代的歷史，破碎的，一塊紅一塊藍似垂珠的吊下來，棉花大半已經剝落了，只有依稀的棉絮藏在千穿百孔的破布中，全件棉衣就只靠一條腰帶繫着。大家都舒着口氣，抖額地說：</p>
<p>「冷透了！」（未完）</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>『那我已經答應過你，郎使他不贖你，在一個月內，我們也必定放你囘家，你可以安心！』</p>
<p>『我不回家，不囘家！』</p>
<p>『你不囘家更好，我不是更多了一位同志嗎？』</p>
<p>『你不撒謊嗎？』</p>
<p>『我告訴過你，我是不撒謊的。』</p>
<p>於是，她郝一度無依靠的靈魂，又有了新的寄托。於是，她對那暫住的房間，打算到長久；把屋內每一用具，都給它們以適宜的位置——此方，她讀　花瓶靠近床邊，準備睡前也可以方便地看見。於是，她感覺他們每個同志，都比來時親切，她把他們看做自己的哥哥和弟弟一樣的同居者，把他們的痛苦看做自己的不幸，把他們的企圖看做自己的希望，她卑視他們沒有美的觀念，開始自動地給他們整理零亂的房閒，最後，她給他們拉攏着隨處拋下的汚穢的衣襪，裹成一團，她爲了避免臭的氣味，揑着鼻孔很久，這工作，她在家時，也從未做過。</p>
<p>『歇歇吧，你看看，已經臟了你的手！』</p>
<p>雨文　阻昔她。但她仍帶着一種稚氣，執拗地反駁：</p>
<p>『什麼你都要管，用你管嗎？』</p>
<p>她一直做到自己滿意的時候，停了，也喘息了，不住地拍打着自己的脯胸。然後，他們都圍在她的身邊，誇贊她。有的說：</p>
<p>『你眞是我們的好妹妺！』也有的說：</p>
<p>『你眞是我們的好同志！』（六十）</p>

<h3>German-Italian Military Alliance and Anglo-Soviet Negotiations</h3>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from Milan yesterday revealed that the German and Italian governments officially announced the establishment of a German-Italian military alliance as a result of their foreign ministers' meeting. Although the details have not been announced, the main point is that Germany and Italy have established a military and political agreement, closely coordinating to make an effective contribution (?) to European peace. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also stated in his newspaper "Telegraph": "Italy and Germany recognize that each has its own sphere of interest... Neither compels the allied country to provide assistance... However, there is one thing that the two countries are closely related to and jointly protect, and that is the war of consciousness, because both countries understand that the failure of one country is the misfortune of the other." From this, one can see a glimpse of the collaboration between Japan and Italy.</p>
<p>The actions of aggressors require mutual assistance because they are abandoned by all peace-loving countries in the world. Since Hitler launched the Eastern Crusade and Italy occupied Albania, and anti-aggression countries planned to actively curb aggressors, German and Italian aggressors have felt the need to quickly form close ties to deal with the encirclement of the anti-aggression front. Therefore, they first released the idea of democratic countries such as Britain and France encircling Germany and Italy, as a prelude to the conclusion of the German-Italian military alliance. In short, the conclusion of the German-Italian military and political agreement is an inevitable outcome, which was expected by clear-sighted politicians around the world. What is most ridiculous is that the highest diplomatic circles in London believe that Italy established the German-Italian political and military alliance because France ignored Italy's invitation to resolve the Franco-Italian dispute. Little do they know that the purpose of this alliance is not only directed at France, but also at dealing with Britain. Didn't Ciano declare that "Germany and Italy each have their own sphere of interest, Italy in the entire Mediterranean region, and Germany in the Baltic Sea and Central European region"? All of those areas have particularly close relations with Britain. The Berlin commentary further emphasized that Germany's recent actions are aimed at "breaking through the British encirclement." German diplomacy is now focused on diplomatic struggles with Britain; all other matters are temporarily regarded as secondary measures.</p>
<p>Today, when Germany and Italy are concentrating their attacks on Britain, Britain should counterattack with strengthened collective forces. At present, in addition to strengthening the ties between Britain, France, and the small countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the most important step is Anglo-Soviet cooperation. As recognized by the London press, "Anglo-Soviet negotiations have reached a critical stage." Britain and the Soviet Union each have different ranges of proposals, and the new proposal submitted by Britain to the Soviet Union yesterday, asking the Soviet government to make a unilateral declaration, is tantamount to refusing to conclude an Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance or send senior officials to hold a meeting. This is a great misfortune for the Soviet Union, but an even greater misfortune for Britain. Because Germany's plan to attack the Soviet Union and induce Poland to cooperate has now largely lost its effectiveness due to Poland's refusal and preparations for resistance (as revealed by France), and the conspiracy to attack Britain is in full swing. Germany is sincerely afraid that Britain will approach the Soviet Union and strengthen its power, so recently it has been particularly sowing discord in the cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt stated: "Since the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union has felt the need to abandon closer relations with democratic countries."</p>
<p>What the German and Italian aggressors fear is the strong restraint of the anti-aggression group under the joint leadership of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Germany especially fears that the Soviet Union will actively assist the small countries of Eastern Europe because of the practical cooperation of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. If Britain wants to protect itself today, it must first protect the small countries that serve as its barrier. If Britain wants to protect the small countries, it must rely on the assistance of the Soviet Union. If Britain wants to stop the aggressors from attacking itself, it can only adopt obvious and active measures to strengthen collective forces, rather than seeking the understanding of Germany and Italy. Germany claims that Britain's leadership of the anti-aggression front is encircling Germany, which is just an excuse for aggressive actions; if Britain alienates the Soviet Union because of this, it will fall into the trap of the aggressors, and Britain itself will be the first to suffer.</p>
<p>The unity of the aggressors is becoming increasingly consolidated, but the leaders of the anti-aggression front are still in the dark. This trend is extremely dangerous!</p>
<h3>Regarding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government</h3>
<p>— Lin Zuhan</p>
<p>At the first session of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Council, Mr. Lin Boqu (Zuhan) delivered a work report on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. This is for each councilor to use as a basis for inspecting the government and deciding on future policies. This report is divided into three parts: The first part is "Defending and consolidating the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is the common task of the people of the whole country and the people of the entire border region": The second part is "The work done by the border region government in protecting the border region and protecting the entire Chinese anti-Japanese war in the past two years": The third part is "The tasks of the border region government in the current stage of the Anti-Japanese War." What is published here is the first part of Mr. Lin's report, which is divided into four chapters.</p>
<p>Defending and Consolidating Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia is the Common Task of the People of the Entire Border Region and All of China</p>
<p>First, the current situation of the pit war and the environment in which the border region is located include the existence of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region that I want to talk about.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation is waging a large-scale war with Japanese ××ism for its own survival. It has been twenty months now. In these twenty months, we have lost many compatriots, many political, economic, and cultural centers, and we have lost a lot of lives and property. In other words, we have suffered temporary local setbacks. This struggle has caused us great difficulties, and these difficulties will increase with the deepening of the Anti-Japanese War. However, the two years of the Anti-Japanese War have brought unprecedented progress to China in all aspects. The experiences and lessons of the Anti-Japanese War in the past two years have proved that the Anti-Japanese War is originally a long, cruel, difficult, and arduous process. As long as we are not afraid of sacrifice, not afraid of pain, and persist in a long-term war, the final victory will definitely belong to us, and the only way to support a long-term war and final victory lies in the greater unity and progress of the entire nation. Now, insisting on continuing the Anti-Japanese War has become an established national policy. The anti-Japanese sentiment of the military and civilians across the country is rising, and pro-Japanese compromise elements have begun to be washed out of the battlefield. International aid to China from Britain, the United States, and France is gradually becoming more active. This is a sign of China's greater unity and progress. On the other hand, after the Japanese invaded Wuhan and Guangzhou, they exposed their weaknesses of insufficient troops and divided forces, and gradually lost their advantages in coordinating operations of the sea, land, and air forces. In the vast areas occupied by the Japanese, we can see the activities of our guerrillas everywhere, making the Japanese exhausted and forced to change their plans; but we must still fully estimate that the Japanese still have some remaining power, and that they are fully prepared to continue attacking the southwest and northwest, while at the same time transferring troops to attack our guerrilla bases. We must especially fully estimate that, in addition to preparing for new military offensives, the Japanese are stepping up efforts to provoke discord and collude with pro-Japanese compromise elements in an attempt to disintegrate the anti-Japanese camp from within.</p>
<p>The first major turning point of this conspiracy was an attempt to establish a counter-Chiang and anti-Communist puppet central government. This is a serious phenomenon in the current political situation. Under this situation, the environment in which the border region is located is very clear. The Japanese attack on the northwest and the border region is undoubtedly an important part of the Japanese invasion plan. Therefore, we must oppose the illusion that the Japanese will not and dare not attack the northwest and the border region. Taking the border region as an example, the Japanese army once occupied Fugucheng in March of last year, and the Japanese artillery shelled Song Louchuan in September. Since November 24, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Yan'an. Don't these facts all show that the border region has become a direct target of the Japanese offensive? But at the same time, we must never be overwhelmed by the preparation of the Japanese to attack the northwest and the border region. The past few Japanese offensives have been attacked by us, and as a result, the Japanese have had to temporarily return. Even if the Japanese come to attack in the future, we are confident that we can stick to our base areas. We have already put forward the task of cooperating with friendly forces to fight for the defense of the northwest and the border region. What needs to be pointed out here is that, in order to realize the plan to attack the border region, the Japanese have been constantly using traitors, Trotskyites, and diehards to carry out various conspiratorial sabotage activities around and inside the border region, and systematically spread opinions about destroying the border region and destroying the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party throughout the country, such as saying that the border region government should be abolished, the Eighth Route Army is not fighting, and the Communist Party should be disbanded, etc., or separating the border region from the National Government and the people of the whole country, in order to achieve the purpose of attacking the border region and the northwest and cutting off the Sino-Soviet transportation line. The propositions he published included many absurd opinions. Isn't this obvious evidence? Therefore, our task is to mobilize the strength of the entire border region and the strength of friendly forces to fight against the Japanese and Japanese offensives in the border region and the northwest, and to support the war on the front lines. Under this task, we must raise the vigilance of the people of the entire border region and prevent the conspiratorial activities of the Han good Trotskyite diehards. We must warn those who consciously or unconsciously are influenced by the Japanese, Japanese, and traitorous influences and shout slogans, oppose and destroy the border region, and oppose and destroy the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party; what you are doing is welcomed by Japanese ××ism. No matter how you send them in the past, you are actually weakening the strength of the entire nation's resistance to Japan, which is tantamount to helping Japan × to destroy China! Your mistakes must be corrected, otherwise the abuse of the ages will be added to your heads.</p>
<p>Second, the Importance of the Border Region in the Anti-Japanese War</p>
<p>Why does Japanese ××ism painstakingly want to attack the border region? This is not surprising. It is undoubtedly because the border region stands in a very important position in the Anti-Japanese War. In what facts does the importance of the border region in the Anti-Japanese War lie? Its main manifestations are:</p>
<p>First, the border region is a politically important area in the whole of China. The people there have used their own strength to establish a base for the national liberation war in the past ten years, realized nationalism, obtained democracy and freedom, realized the people's rights, obtained people's livelihood reform, and realized the people's livelihood. In recent years, they have adhered to the anti-Japanese national united front and made a lot of efforts to unite the country. In the eighteen months of the Anti-Japanese War, they have contributed a great deal to assisting the front lines; under extremely difficult conditions, they have adhered to the correct political direction, carried forward the hard-working style, and strictly implemented clean politics. May I ask how many governments in the country are as clean as the border region government? The border region government is a local government under the jurisdiction of the central government, and the border region is a part of China's territory. More than that, it is an advanced part. We are not exaggerating to say that the border region is really a model anti-Japanese base area. In the border region, except for traitors, the people are given complete democratic rights. The people not only have complete freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and arms, but also implement universal, direct, equal, and anonymous democratic elections. In other words, the people of the border region have obtained democracy and freedom. They not only do not want to be the cattle and horses of Japanese ××ism, but also prepare to fight steadfastly with the Japanese ××. Not only have they established a democratic anti-Japanese base area, but also can contribute their experience to the people of the whole country, so that the people of the country can take less detours in the anti-Japanese struggle and the cause of national construction, and make the great cause of the national anti-Japanese war and national construction succeed as early as possible.</p>
<p>Second, the border region has a population of more than 2 million. Although most of the vast land is yellow soil grassland, the land is fertile. The arable land alone in the statistics of eighteen counties such as Yan'an is 400,000 miles. The current cultivated area is 9 million mu, and there is still a vast garden for customs clearance. The border region is extremely rich in grain and cotton production. Petroleum food is also a major production, animal husbandry is extremely developed, and there are also many coal and iron cocoons. Judging from these self-sufficient conditions, the border region is also a good place to adhere to the Anti-Japanese War. Moreover, the border region is also the salt land where our national ancestors originated. This is the mausoleum of the Xuanyuan real belt. Here, we have shed the blood of our ancestors to resist foreign insults. The people here have a particularly high sense of national self-esteem and self-confidence. This is because the people of the border region inherited the traditions of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Third, in military terms, because the border region occupies parts of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, connects Gansu and Ningxia to the west, connects Suiyuan to the north, and borders Shanxi to the east, it becomes the northern gate lock to protect the northwest on the one hand, and on the other hand, it becomes an important rear area for adhering to the anti-Japanese war in the northwest. In military terms, the border region is also the strategic fulcrum of North China and the Northwest. From this, we can know the importance of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region. ×× will never give up the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, and the region must adhere to its own position and cooperate with the national strength to fight this evil ××.</p>
<p>Third, the Production and Basis of the Border Region</p>
<p>Precisely because of the importance of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, it is not only constantly subjected to the rumors, slander, attacks, and sabotage of traitors, but also becomes a thorn in the side of some diehards. They spread various rumors about the border region everywhere, and even said that the border region is "a new feudal separatist regime" and "the border region has no legal basis." Therefore, they demanded the abolition of the border region and carried out various sabotage conspiracies inside and outside the border region. Although these diehards are still inside the anti-Japanese camp today, the work they are doing today is actually beneficial to the Japanese ××.</p>
<p>Comrades, I will now talk about the existence of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has its full historical, factual, and legal basis. Now, this border region was originally the most backward and complex region ten years ago. The people here were subjected to cruel national and feudal exploitation economically, inhumane oppression and slavery politically, and were backward in culture to an almost unimaginable degree. After the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the people here could not bear this burden and automatically organized and armed themselves under the leadership of Chinese Communist Party comrades, and started the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle in this area. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, two Soviet governments, the Shaanxi-Gansu Border Region (including Guanzhong) and the Shaanbei (including Shenfu), were established one after another. Politically, they implemented the policies of national liberation ××ism and established a thorough democratic system. Economically, they implemented the distribution of land, abolished exorbitant taxes and levies, and improved the treatment of workers. Culturally, they also began to carry out compulsory education and social education, and at the same time universally organized and armed the people. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the main force of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north on the Long March to resist Japan, and after arriving in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, it unified the two governments and the newly developed areas and established the Northwest Office of the Soviet Central Government. Of course, this government should be directly led by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and directly supported and supervised by the local people. It is a completely independent, free, revolutionary, and democratic government. How can it be different from the bases of feudal warlords, because there is no warlord there?</p>
<p>(Note: A paragraph is missing in the original manuscript here, and it will be published in the next issue.)</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang and the representatives of the CPC Central Committee have repeatedly acknowledged the status of the border region government in their talks, and have repeatedly promised to issue orders formally recognizing the border region government. Premier Kong Xiangxi of the Executive Yuan also formally determined that the border region is an area under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan under the instructions of Chairman Chiang. Therefore, although we have not received a formal order from the National Government to formally establish the border region government, and some counties promised by Chairman Chiang have not been formally归belong to the border region, the legal status of the border region government has long been determined. Of course, we do not deny that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government has very different places from other areas under the jurisdiction of the National Government. The past history has made the Border Region Government have its own characteristics. Where are these characteristics? This is when we measure our border region with the breadth of the Three People's Principles, then I should boldly say: Our characteristic is that we earnestly realize the Three People's Principles and the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Program. This characteristic should not only not be abolished in the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction today, but should exist and develop greatly. This border region government that implements the Three People's Principles and the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Program is, of course, the most legal government. There is no doubt about it. Apart from the standards based on the highest principles of the Three People's Principles and the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Program, what other legal standards are there? Of course not. This is the production and basis of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, the initiator and steadfast implementer of the anti-Japanese national united front, the thorough implementer of the Three People's Principles and the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Program, the honest supporter of Chairman Chiang, the constituent part of the National Government, and the protector of national defense, protecting the Northwest, and adhering to the long-term war. This is the basis for the production of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.</p>
<p>Fourth, Persisting in the Existence of the Border Region, Defending the Border Region, Striving for Victory in the Anti-Japanese War, and an Important Link in Building a New China of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>Comrades, in summary of the previous report, our conclusion is that the existence and consolidation of the border region are consistent with the interests of the people of the whole country. Any loss or weakening of the border region is actually of concern and care to patriotic compatriots across the country and peace-loving people all over the world. Young people from all over the country come to Yan'an to study, and detailed introductions about the border region are lengthy. These facts are enough to prove that owning the existence and consolidation of the border region represents the interests, will, and demands of the people of the whole country. This is a strong guarantee for striving for victory in the Anti-Japanese War and building a new China of the Three People's Principles. In the past two years, all our work, all our efforts, and all our struggles have been carried out in this direction. Therefore, we have sufficient reason to say that persisting in the existence of the border region and defending the border region is an important link in striving for victory in the Anti-Japanese War and building a new China of the Three People's Principles. This is the first part of my report.</p>
<h3>Total National Mobilization and Spiritual National Mobilization (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Kai Feng</p>
<p>(III) Concerning national self-confidence and self-respect -- this is a necessary condition for the determination to resist and the belief in victory. If one belittles one's own nation and always feels that others' things are good and one's own things are not, if one does not have enough self-confidence and self-respect in one's own nation and one's own strength, then it is impossible to maintain the determination to resist and the confidence in victory. Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must promote the glorious history of our nation, especially the national heroes who bravely sacrificed themselves for the nation and the country in the War of Resistance. National traitors and puppets have lost their Chinese humanity, abandoned the national integrity of our Chinese ancestors, and lost the excellent morals of our Chinese nation. Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must enhance national integrity and promote national virtues. Similarly, in spiritual mobilization, we must promote revolutionary patriotism and the spirit of loving the nation. This includes two aspects: the first aspect is that we must inspire the love for one's own country in the people. The Japanese are trying to destroy our country. We cannot survive if we do not love our own country. The second aspect is that the government should pay more attention to and care about the suffering of the people, so that the people feel that their country is lovable. These two aspects must advance simultaneously. We must promote national thought. The promotion of this national thought is to inspire hatred for Japan. We must highly promote national hatred for Japan. Traitors and compromisers who rely on the breath of Japan are bringing the "Greater East Asiaism," "Sino-Japanese-Manchu Cooperation," and "Sino-Japanese-Manchu Community" manufactured by Japan to China, trying to extinguish the Chinese people's national hatred for Japan. It is these traitors who are advocating the idea of transcending the nation. Similarly, Japan is manufacturing pseudo-puppets, and some shameless traitors are playing on stage. Some compromisers are trying to cede certain territories of China and damage certain sovereign rights of China in order to seek compromise with Japan. It is these people who are damaging the absolute independence of the Chinese nation and damaging the absolute integrity of Chinese territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>(IV) Concerning the improvement of politics -- the improvement of politics is a basic condition for guaranteeing victory in the war. Since the War of Resistance, there has been much progress in our country's politics, but from the perspective of guaranteeing victory in the war, it must be said that the progress of our country's politics is far from enough. The progress of the War of Resistance in politics is not enough to guarantee the final victory of the War of Resistance, especially at the current stage. We must make rapid progress in politics so that we can prepare our new strength more quickly. Chairman Chiang pointed out that in the Second Phase of the War of Resistance, "politics is more important than military affairs," which precisely illustrates the important significance of accelerating political progress at present. Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must not only explain the necessity of political improvement, but also carry out real political improvement. Similarly, in spiritual mobilization, we must review the implementation of the central government's and the highest military's war-resistance laws and military orders. For example, in the past, Han Fuqu and Li Fuying, etc., could not execute the military orders of the highest military authorities and abandoned the country's territory without authorization. For example, on certain battle lines, individual military commanders were not resolute in executing the orders of the highest military authorities. For example, in the guerrilla areas after the occupation, individual responsible authorities automatically escaped when the enemy attacked. These all undermined the unity of military orders. Also, the local governments and lower-level political institutions did not earnestly implement the central government's conscription law in conscription, thus causing the phenomenon of extortion and fraud in conscription in some places. The central government's regulations on preferential treatment for the families of soldiers on expedition were not implemented in many places, thus affecting the smooth progress of conscription. Similar phenomena of not executing the central government's war-resistance orders precisely undermined the unity of political orders.</p>
<p>(V) Concerning the development of mass movements -- the purpose of spiritual mobilization is to achieve the exertion of organized strength, just as the program says, "not only in mobilization, but especially in organization." Through spiritual mobilization, more masses can be organized. Therefore, spiritual mobilization should not only be limited to general explanations and propaganda, but also be able to organize the masses in various ways in this explanation and propaganda. To be able to organize the masses, we must first earnestly implement the oath of the National Covenant and the methods of the National Assembly, and convene people of various natures and different professions to hold meetings separately in accordance with the outline of the National Monthly Assembly, and hold them on a regular basis. Through the form of the National Monthly Assembly, we should use existing organizations and create new organizations to organize all the people who have taken the oath of the National Covenant, so that the work of spiritual mobilization can be carried out regularly. After the National Covenant oath, we should establish regular political education for the people, "establish war-resistance consciousness, discuss the world situation, and study the history of the country and the rise and fall of the people and foreign troubles."</p>
<p>(VI) Concerning the establishment of wartime life -- "life is the foundation of the spirit. Without a rational life, there is no sound spirit." Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must make great efforts to mobilize the establishment of wartime life. The standard of wartime life is to break the life of drunken stupor, break the life of temporary ease, break the life of selfishness, and cultivate an enterprising and vigorous life, cultivate a life of great impartiality and courage, cultivate a life of brave sacrifice, and cultivate a life of killing oneself to achieve benevolence and sacrificing oneself to take righteousness. Concretely speaking, wartime life is based on the heroic sacrifice and hard struggle of the soldiers. When the War of Resistance has been going on for more than twenty months, the lives of the front line and the rear are still too far apart. The front line is heroically sacrificed, hard-fought, lively, and tense, while the rear still has a lot of drunken stupor, feasting and extravagance. Therefore, spiritual mobilization must make the life of the rear like the front line. Similarly, the disparity between the rich and the poor in the War of Resistance is also a reason that affects the interest of the working masses in participating in the War of Resistance. Therefore, after spiritual mobilization, we must lower the luxurious life of the rich and raise the life of the laboring masses who do not have enough food and clothing. This will better promote the enthusiasm of the laboring masses in participating in the War of Resistance and improving production.</p>
<p>A selfish life is to forget the interests of the nation and the country, and to put personal interests above the interests of the nation and the country. These people lack the concept of the nation and the country. They always want to use the environment created by the War of Resistance and the various difficulties of the War of Resistance to create personal interests, to achieve attempts outside the nation and the country, and to achieve the intention of making a fortune from the country. For example, there are phenomena such as manipulating the black market, monopolizing speculation, engaging in private malfeasance, and extorting and eating dirt. Spiritual mobilization must correct and sanction these phenomena.</p>
<p>Similarly, in spiritual mobilization, we must strengthen the concept of the interests of the nation and the country, so that everyone understands that the interests of the Chinese nation and the interests of the Chinese people should be higher than those of the revolutionaries. They should take the interests of the liberation of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people as their interests.</p>
<p>Overcoming the Dangerous Signs of Relaxation in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>At present, the war seems to be in a state of temporary silence on the surface. This is firstly because Japan, after occupying Wuhan and Guangzhou, had to have a period of consolidation due to excessive consumption of troops. Secondly, after Japan's strategy of "quick victory" was broken, they thought of using the seemingly silent state of frontal warfare to carry out political division. On the one hand, they tempted some wavering compromisers and national traitors like Wang Jingwei to surrender openly. On the other hand, they used the seemingly silent state of frontal warfare to create peace illusions in some people in China, so as to relax our country's war resistance mobilization and the growth of new forces. At the same time, they wanted to use the seemingly silent state of frontal warfare to cause an increase in internal friction in China. Some short-sighted people were confused by Japan's conspiracy -- instead of concentrating all will and strength to strengthen war resistance mobilization and lengthen new forces, they used it to create internal friction. Secondly, Japan thought of using this period to concentrate its forces to "sweep away" the guerrilla areas. At this time, the tension and intensity of the war in the guerrilla areas, especially in the Northeast, were unprecedented. It is not easy for places far away from the guerrilla areas to feel the intensity of the war in the guerrilla areas. Due to all these reasons, after the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, it is a fact that in some people in some places there was relaxation in war resistance mobilization. When the enemy is starting to attack, this relaxation phenomenon is a very serious and dangerous phenomenon for China's war resistance. Through this spiritual mobilization, we should overcome all these phenomena. Spiritual mobilization is a form of war resistance mobilization. If the work of explanation and propaganda is done well, and if it can be matched with the work of organizing the masses, it will definitely be able to exert its due effect. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly carry out the work of spiritual mobilization. The purpose of spiritual mobilization is also to promote organized strength, strengthen war resistance mobilization, and strengthen war resistance strength.</p>

<h3>Great Annihilation Battle in Zaoyang, North Hubei  An Entire Japanese Regiment Falls into Trap and is Annihilated Entirely Plan to Invade Northern Hunan is Shattered by Us</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 8th] Since our army launched attacks on various lines in Zoufu, central Jiangxi, and northern Hunan, it has been more than ten days, and it has experienced nearly 50 battles of various sizes. Strategically and tactically, it has achieved considerable results. First, the Japanese claim to move troops to invade northern Hunan has been preempted and shattered by us. Second, in each battle, our army can exchange small sacrifices for great victories. The total amount of spoils and captures in these ten days exceeds our own consumption and casualties by about two times. Third, each time we attack, we can seize the initiative and strike the Japanese everywhere, making the Japanese flustered and running for their lives, without time to fight back. Fourth, each place that is attacked by us is a vital point of the Japanese, often causing them to suffer great losses and threats. What is especially characteristic is that our army's coordination and application of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare has gradually become more mature in this attack, and it has the momentum of evolving from a guerrilla force posture to a field army posture. Therefore, although our army is currently not in a hurry to seek the occupation of strategic points, it sometimes does not hesitate to defend the occupied areas with all its might at a certain time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zaoyang Front, 7th] In Yinjia Village east of the city, our army's front made a large opening on the 7th, luring the Japanese to go deep.

Our army calmly listened to the battle. After holding out for two hours, the Japanese were finally repelled. In the past two days, the war in the Fengxin area has been relatively quiet.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fenshui, 7th] A certain unit of our troops attacked the Japanese at Henglu, fifty miles north of Wuning, on the morning of the 7th, killing more than 300 Japanese and occupying the area. They took advantage of the victory to recapture Xie Village nearby.</p>
<p>Guangdong Japanese troops are unable to invade west</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 7th] Since the Japanese suffered a disastrous defeat in the Zhu-Liuhe battle, their conspiracy to invade the west has been shattered. In recent days, we have been advancing steadily along the Xinhe and Xinkai roads, giving the Japanese a major threat.

<h3>Chongqing City Evacuates Its Population Problems of Refugees Eased</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 7th] The National Government is using all its manpower and financial resources to evacuate the people and provide them with food, clothing, and shelter. The refugee problem here has eased. Many of the air-raid shelters in the city have been converted into simple but fully furnished homes. The evacuees are no longer fleeing from Chongqing and walking along the various relief stations. All public and private vehicles have been requisitioned to transport refugees and their belongings to the first relief station for rest and food, and then they are sent on their way from there. Workers are still excavating in the destroyed areas, and the remains of people who have been bombed or burned to death are constantly being discovered, but it is impossible to identify them. Most of the stores in the city have not yet opened, and their stocks have been transported away. Many stallholders have moved to Jiangnan, and it is quite difficult for people to find food on the north bank.</p>
<h3>British Press Comments on Japanese Air Raids on Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The "News Chronicle" here wrote today, "The wartime capital of China has suffered the most terrible air raids in the history of warfare. The war in China will continue for a long time, but Westerners have no reason to forget this war. China's long-term resistance is full of difficulties and will eventually give the aggressor a final defeat."</p>
<h3>Chongqing Industries Bombed British Studying the Matter Official Denies Protest Lodged</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Reports that Ambassador Craigie in Japan has protested to the Japanese government about the bombing of British industries in Chongqing are considered inaccurate by officials here. It is said that the matter is being carefully studied in London. Ambassador Craigie has pointed out the seriousness of this action to the Japanese Foreign Minister.</p>
<h3>May Ninth National Humiliation Shanghai People Observe Vegetarian Diet in Commemoration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Shanghai News: Yesterday was China's May Ninth National Humiliation Day. Various Chinese groups in Shanghai especially requested citizens to eat vegetarian food for one day. According to past National Humiliation Days, all sectors of Shanghai must lower the flag at half-mast to commemorate it. However, the Chinese side had previously stipulated with the concession authorities that the national flag could only be flown on eight days each year, but May Ninth was not one of these eight days.</p>
<h3>Our Army Once Broke into Dezhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th] On the 27th of last month, a certain unit of our army in northern Shandong, with swift and secretive actions, broke through the Japanese warning line and attacked Dezhou fiercely, breaking into the city and killing countless Japanese soldiers. The Japanese warehouses, armories, factories, and puppet agencies were burned to the ground. A few hours later, Japanese reinforcements from all directions gathered. Our army destroyed the Jinpu Railway tracks and station and safely withdrew to a certain place.</p>
<h3>Shantou Hit by Hurricane Many Sampans Sank</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shantou, 8th] The harbor here was hit by a hurricane yesterday. Many of the sampans in the harbor were overturned. These sampans were full of refugees.

<h3>Puppet Troops in Northern Henan Rose Up in Revolt</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th] On the 8th of last month, two to three hundred soldiers of the puppet army under Xun Yuchun, stationed in Qixian County, mutinied in the area, shot the Japanese advisor Si Ming, and annihilated all the puppet troops in Qixian County. The puppet organizations were destroyed, and they surrendered to a certain unit of our army. In addition, the three hundred soldiers of the puppet army under Li Zhongcai in Jixian County also revolted in full on the 26th of last month. The Japanese and puppet advisors were all executed. The trend of revolt is extremely strong in the area, and our army is powerful, making the Japanese army very panicked.</p>
<h3>Director of the Wuhan Branch of the Central News Agency Li Yaoqing Dies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] When Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed Chongqing City on the 4th of this month, the Central News Agency was destroyed, and Li Yaoqing, the director of the Wuhan branch of the agency, was seriously injured. The treatment was ineffective, and he died on the morning of the 8th. He was buried in the afternoon. The Central Propaganda Department, because Li participated in party affairs work in his early years and served the Central News Agency for many years, with outstanding achievements, sent a letter of condolence to Li's family, sent Peng Gechen, the director of the News Affairs Office, to express condolences on behalf of the Central Committee, and will present a request for preferential treatment from the Central Committee.</p>
<h3>Southeast Coastal × Ships Rampant, Merchant Ships Frequently Encounter Trouble, British Government Values Navigation Rights, Sending Warships to Southern China Said</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Fuzhou, 7th] Since × ships have intensified the blockade of our coastal ports, over the past ten days, merchant ships from Britain, the United States, France, and Germany, on the seas off Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, have been repeatedly detained, looted, and searched by × ships. The number is no less than thirty or forty ships. British merchant shipping companies have successively requested their respective governments to lodge serious protests with ×. It is heard that the British government has now decided to dispatch a large number of warships to southern China to protect navigation rights and order each merchant ship to install gun emplacements to implement armed self-defense.</p>
<h3>A Meeting with General Tang Enbo</h3>
<p>— Gao Fen</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] We have met General Zhang Fakui, who once commanded armies, General Bai Chongxi, who was dignified and outstanding, and General Wu Qihui, who was amiable and approachable. But the one with a simple and unadorned quality, wearing an ant cloth Zhongshan suit, with a peasant-like facial expression, and who is modest and shrewd, is General Tang Enbo. During battles, he would certainly patrol the front lines alone on horseback, directing junior officers to fight and inspecting the terrain. He was strict in governing the army and emphasized soldier education. His troops were elite. He established meritorious service in many battles, such as the Battle of Nankou, the Battle of Xuzhou, and the defense of Greater Wuhan, where he fought on the Ruiwu Line... Now, he has shifted from the battlefield, where he strategized and commanded, to concentrating his energy on training thousands of excellent ×× troops. He greets every visiting guest with a smile. Just as he could shake hands and chat with farmers on the battlefield and could talk about scriptures with the monks in the temples of the ×× mountains, encouraging them to participate in the resistance against Japan, and organize stray children, ensuring they receive a good education, calling each child by name in a friendly manner... These are the indelible impressions he left on the common people on various battlefields. In ××, he influenced more than thirty Japanese prisoners of war, and a group of common people developed feelings of respect and love for him. These displays of spirit are worthy of emulation by many officers.</p>
<p>He originally had foresight in politics. When the fighting on the Eastern Front had just ended, he held cadre training classes in his direct subordinate units. "Cadres are the keys to the people." Today, he shoulders a greater mission as the education chief of the ×× cadre training class. The excellent young people of ×× are partly serving battalion commanders with combat experience and partly political workers. There are also over a hundred female comrades, all dispatched from various troops and war zones across the country. Some come from as far away as Xinjiang, Gansu, and Suiyuan. "The training focuses on political aspects, and after the training, they will be distributed to the rear of × people, striking at the appeasement policies implemented by × people and striving for a greater number of people with our own regime."</p>
<p>"General Tang, what are your thoughts on the overall strategy after the fall of Nanchang?" Although the general did not participate in commanding the Ganbei campaign this time, he still has a profound understanding of the overall situation. He smiled, lowered his voice, and said slowly, "I don't have much to say... but after the fall of Nanchang, Changsha can be protected without worry. The battle situation in northern Hunan is stable. × people's capture of Nanchang only increases their own burden and consumes manpower... Nanchang is being attacked by our country. Our counter-attacking troops are very effective. × troops hoped to seize a stronghold, but who knew it would become a place surrounded by us..." His words were concise and powerful, but he was always smiling. Then, based on the current battle situation, he confidently predicted that the main force of the × people would concentrate on the north bank of the Yangtze River to sweep away our guerrillas.</p>
<p>The defense of Xuzhou left an indelible impression on everyone. Because of this, General Tang again recalled the cooperation between the military and civilians in Xuzhou, the true situation of the people helping in the battle. He praised it vigorously, raising his voice particularly high, saying, "The people of Xuzhou are the best and very brave. They can truly assist the soldiers in combat, and some care for the soldiers like their own family, delivering tea, water, and food to the front lines. This is a rare thing in any war zone... Therefore, the fighting strength of the brothers has been greatly enhanced. ×" The main reason why Xuzhou was able to be defended for a relatively long time was that the people cooperated with the disciplined army, achieving a level of military-civilian mutual assistance. Now, it has been a full ten months since the fall of Xuzhou. In these ten months, our war has entered the second phase. "Propaganda is more important than combat" and "strengthening military-civilian cooperation." But what we see is, how is the mass mobilization work in each war zone? Is it better than or at least as good as Xuzhou's performance? Based on the facts, finding an old commoner near the Nanyuan front lines still requires the army to search for them with all kinds of methods. On the Guangdong front lines, although the commoners do not necessarily run away upon hearing the sound of cannons, there are still those who remain on the front lines and act as traitors. This makes us reflect painfully on how we should be vigilant.</p>
<p>General Tang's conversation gradually became livelier. When talking about Mr. Ludi, who had taught for two weeks in the training class, he said, "He and Mr. Feng Naichao came to see me yesterday, but unfortunately, I wasn't home." He smiled, looking very apologetic. "I wanted to see them, but I don't know the way." Mr. Yao, who was with us, told him that we were very familiar friends with Mr. Ludi and that if we went to see him now, he could guide the way. So he stood up excitedly and asked his entourage to take care of his luggage because he would be leaving in two hours. We ran out of the Lequn Society's gate. It was raining goose feathers in the sky, and none of us had brought raincoats. Mr. Yao held up an umbrella: "Let's share an umbrella." He quickly and modestly said, "It's okay, it's okay." In a moment, he was soaked all over, but he didn't seem to notice anything, talking about the weather in Guilin as he walked. Unfortunately, Mr. Ludi had just gone out, and we missed him, and he reluctantly returned.</p>
<p>This time, General Tang was in a great hurry, and being able to talk so freely was very exciting. (Draft from the National Salvation Society)</p>
<h3>A Follow-up Report on the Battle of Ji Wang Mountain—An Interview with a Soldier from Special Regiment 1</h3>
<p>— Sanjiang</p>
<p>Q: I heard that after you arrived at Ji Wang Mountain last year, you engaged the × people several times. But each time,</p>
<p>A: There were about three times. Our team (referring to Special Regiment 1) fought the bravest.</p>
<p>Q: What were those three times?</p>
<p>A: The first time was the Battle of Yangjialing (October 14, 1938). The 6th Company suffered the greatest losses. The 6th Company Commander, Zhan Ming, personally led thirty-odd daring warriors. Around 2 a.m. at night, they attacked the × people in Xijing Village. They didn't fire a single shot. When they reached the × people, they used hand grenades to kill thirty or forty of them. I heard that the × people hadn't even put on their pants and fought each other. At dawn, the × people counterattacked and occupied Yangjialing. The × people lost forty or fifty men in total this time. We had nine soldiers wounded or killed. The second time (November 8), over a thousand × people attacked Ji Wang Mountain in three routes. One route went through Shao Village East Village, another through Shao Village. Both routes attacked Shanmen Village. The other route went to Sanlu Li Village, using artillery to bombard Bajiamen and Shanmen Village. The 7th Company alone fought them for most of the day at Shanmen Village. But the 7th Company used fortifications for ambush. After the × people got close, they used light machine guns and rifles to fiercely attack. As a result, because the × people's strength was too great, the 7th Company retreated to the trench. The × people then retreated to Sanlu Li Village. The × people suffered twenty or thirty casualties this time. One of our soldiers was injured by machine gun fire, and two were injured by artillery fire. The third time (December 5), the × people besieged Ji Wang Mountain from eight routes. The 3rd Battalion fought the most fiercely with the × people. From 3 a.m., when the × people began their attack, the 3rd Battalion fought the × people continuously until dusk.</p>
<p>Q: Please tell me in detail what happened during this battle.</p>
<p>A: The × people began their attack from Mo Village around 2 a.m. Because the 3rd Battalion's position was near Hanxue Village (about five miles from Guojiacha and Shanmen Village), and the terrain was relatively low, the × people came straight from behind in close formation. When Battalion Commander Yan received the report, he ordered the 7th and 9th Companies to prepare for battle. 7th Company Commander Li Shoupeng and 9th Company Commander Xie Lidao saw that the × people were only about three hundred meters from the position and immediately ordered to open fire, wiping out the × people. At the same time, 7th Company's 1st Platoon Leader He Li and 9th Company's 1st Platoon Leader Ma Jing each selected ten brave men and launched an attack, using hand grenades to bomb the × people. Many × people were wounded or killed at the time, and they captured a × person's Miyajima flag. The × people then launched a fierce counterattack and had to retreat to their original position. As a result, 7th Company Commander Li Shoupeng and 9th Company Platoon Leader Zhang Changsheng were wounded, and over twenty soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Q: How was Company Commander Li wounded?</p>
<p>A: Because the × people occupied Xue Village Ditch, they used artillery to bombard behind Guojiacha. Over a hundred × people's cavalry charged towards our position. Company Commander Li was injured near his left eye and had to retreat the troops slightly to the new position.</p>
<p>Q: The × people's artillery fire was so fierce, why didn't the 3rd Battalion retreat?</p>
<p>A: Because the × people surrounded them from several directions, they couldn't get out. The battalion commander and deputy battalion commander (Zhang Shaozong) personally led the 8th and 9th Companies several times without success. As a result, Deputy Battalion Commander Chen died (behind the northeast high ground of Shao Village Zhong Village).</p>
<p>Q: What other spoils of war did you get?</p>
<p>A: 7th Company Platoon Leader Chen Zuolin also obtained × people's light machine guns, rifles, helmets, and bullets. Because the battalion commander ordered him to attack the right flank of the × people, he went through that depression. The × people didn't know about it, giving him a surprise attack.</p>
<p>Q: Didn't the × people attack Shanmen Village at all? Which company was defending there?</p>
<p>A: Two platoons of the 8th Company were at Shanmen Village. Because the security army of Village fought the × people at Shao Village, the × people didn't dare come. They only used artillery bombardment. However, the × people's forces were very strong in the Shao Village and Shangguo Village area. The × people at the foot of the mountain were on the defensive. The rest came from behind.</p>
<p>Q: Where was the 1st Battalion?</p>
<p>A: The 1st Battalion ambushed the × people in the Wencun Liulin Village area.</p>
<p>Q: Where was the 2nd Battalion?</p>
<p>A: The 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion was the first to contact the × people at Han Village. The 4th Company ambushed the × people in the Shi Village Ditch position. The 6th Company ambushed the × people in the Yangjialing position.</p>
<p>Q: In total, how many casualties did the × people suffer in this battle, and how many did we suffer?</p>
<p>A: The × people lost one artillery colonel (at Bajiamen) and one Commander Ushijima (in front of the 3rd Battalion's position). The rest of the officers and soldiers totaled three or four hundred dead and wounded. Our regiment lost one officer (Deputy Battalion Commander Zhang Shaozong), over twenty soldiers were killed, and two officers and over ten soldiers were wounded. The 3rd Battalion suffered the most.</p>
<p>Q: I heard that Brigade Commander Xu also died in battle this time. How did Brigade Commander Xu die?</p>
<p>A: I heard that after the × people occupied Gouxi Village, the brigade commander personally led the guards to Bajiamen to supervise the battle and was killed by × people's artillery fire. At the same time, the Guard Company Commander also died in battle.</p>
<p>Our losses in this battle were also great, but the brothers became more and more enthusiastic as they fought. Everyone was determined to drive the Japanese × people out of China.</p>
<p>The exercise call sounded. I told him to go to the exercise, and he stopped talking.</p>

<h3>Results of Milan Talks: German-Italian Political and Military Alliance, Foreign Ministers of Both Countries Return Home Separately, Rumor of Italian King's Reciprocal Visit to Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 7th] The German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met in Milan and have agreed to conclude an Italian-German military alliance. After their talks, they issued a communique stating: "Ciano and Ribbentrop considered the current general situation and international situation during their talks on May 6th and 7th. The absolute identity of the two governments' observations has been expressed again. Therefore, it has been decided to jointly conclude a political and military alliance as the final way to maintain the relationship between the two Axis powers. Germany and Italy also want to make an effective contribution to guaranteeing peace in Europe through this."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 7th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that the political and military alliance agreed upon by the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy in Milan yesterday will be formally signed in Berlin in a short period of time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 7th] Political circles here did not regard the announcement of the formal alliance between Germany and Italy as an unusual move. According to the commentary published by Gayda in "Italian Voice," the understanding between Italy and Germany has not changed due to this alliance. In fact, the reason why the two countries announced the formal alliance is simply to publicly tighten Italy's commitment. Ciano's mouthpiece, "Telegraph," stated that Germany and Italy recognize that each has its own sphere of interests. In the Italian side, it is the entire Mediterranean, and in the German side, it is the Baltic Sea and Central Europe. The two countries will carry out their own work with absolute self-reliance, and they should not force absolute direct assistance to the other party, except to facilitate their progress. However, in one situation, the two countries should be absolutely united. What is this situation? It is the ideological war. In this case, both countries have reaffirmed their determination, because they understand that if one country fails, the other cannot survive alone. Ciano will return to Rome today, and Ribbentrop will also depart for Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 7th] Chancellor Hitler visited Italy last May. It is now widely rumored here that Italian King Emmanuel III has decided to visit Germany for a reciprocal visit on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 7th] According to well-informed sources, after Germany and Italy conclude a military alliance, it makes it possible for Japan to quickly join in forming a triangular military alliance. If the Soviet Union, in view of this move by Germany and Italy, renews negotiations with Britain and France to form a tripartite alliance, then Germany and Italy will conclude an anti-communist military agreement with Japan. Japanese officials here admitted that the Japanese government is approaching Germany and Italy to negotiate the conclusion of an anti-communist military agreement. However, so far, there has been no success. Observers generally believe that the reason why Germany and Italy have not yet concluded a military agreement with Japan is to observe whether the Soviet Union will adopt an isolated attitude towards European events. It is heard that the conclusion of the alliance between Germany and Italy is intended to guarantee each other that if the implementation of a policy by either party causes a war, the other party should provide assistance. Otherwise, Germany and Italy would never conclude this alliance.</p>
<h3>After Germany and Italy Announce Alliance, Current Situation Not Affected, Britain and Soviet Union Believe It Is a Response to Peace Group, US Speculates Japan Will Be Isolated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] After Germany and Italy decided to conclude a political and military alliance, financial figures here commented that Japan has always opposed the signing of a military alliance by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Now that Germany and Italy have established this agreement, it may not be impossible to induce Japan to change its original intention. The main goal of Germany and Italy in doing this is to respond to the efforts of Britain and France to organize an anti-aggression group. But in practical terms, the current situation will not change because of this. German and Italian staff officers have repeatedly held talks recently, and German Aviation Minister Goering has even visited Italian Libya to inspect defenses. Their close military cooperation has not been a matter of one day, which can be seen from this. However, the outside world had hoped that Italy could maintain neutrality in wartime, but now it has been despaired of.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the conclusion of a political and military alliance by Germany and Italy to demonstrate the relationship between the Axis powers is not surprising here. However, officials are reserving criticism for the time being because the detailed contents of the alliance have not yet been obtained. But what we must remember is that for a considerable period of time, the relationship between Germany and Italy has become a favorite topic for German and Italian politicians. The tone of the German-Italian communique seems to be specifically aimed at stopping rumors that Italy is dissatisfied with German policies. But from another perspective, if the general Italian people are dissatisfied with the existing German-Italian connection, then the conclusion of the alliance is enough to show their dissatisfaction. Observers in London believe that the alliance is to determine Germany's military position in German-Italian relations. Diplomatic circles are discussing two points: (1) the impact of Italy's possible neutrality in certain circumstances; (2) Germany's relations with the Mediterranean and North Africa.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] Government-affiliated sources commented that the political and military alliance between Germany and Italy is slightly different. In the past, the countries have already maintained an alliance relationship militarily. This event is only to confirm it legally and will not affect the international situation. The common intention is probably that because the attitude of Western European countries is firm, they want to respond with intimidation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Diplomats here speculate that the German-Italian military alliance may isolate Japan and force it to seek closer relations with Western democracies. Trade experts, who are well aware that Japan's trade is heavily dependent on Britain and the United States, believe that Japan is the most economically vulnerable. According to statistics, in 1937, 72 percent of Japan's wartime needs were imported from Britain and the United States, only 4 percent from Germany, and even less from Italy, which can be ignored. Senator King said that the purpose of Germany and Italy's military alliance, even if not to dominate the world, must be to conquer Europe.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 8th] Today, newspapers here attach great importance to the German-Italian military agreement and say that German political figures will successively go to Italy for reciprocal visits. London and Paris are not surprised by the conclusion of this agreement between Germany and Italy. The French "Radio Communication Agency" said that this agreement cannot change the European situation. The "Paris Morning News" also holds the same view. However, after the signing of this agreement, the newspapers have changed their tone on the issue of Danzig, anticipating that Italy will support Germany's demands. "Little Paris News" advocates opposing the solution of the Danzig issue by voting, saying that most of the citizens are Germans, and the political power is also in the hands of the Germans. Britain and France must still be prepared to prevent unforeseen circumstances. The current evolution of the European situation depends on how the Soviet Union responds to the British proposal.</p>
<h3>British Labor Party Suggests Reorganizing Army, Simon Delivers Speech, Britain Prepared for the Worst</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The British Labor Party's defense policy suggests reorganizing the British army and democratizing it. The policy has been decided and will be submitted to the Labor Party Congress in Weisan. It advocates increasing wages, improving working conditions, and establishing a supply department and a defense department, giving them broad powers to prevent manufacturing delays and improper profiteering. It stipulates that those seeking positions must first serve in the army for one year, saying that this will be very effective both militarily and socially, and advocates that army personnel be free to join various labor unions and professional organizations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon delivered a speech in Great Yarmouth yesterday, discussing the government's conscription decision. He said that the international situation is changing rapidly and that we must be prepared early and must not prepare only after the outbreak of the 1914 war. We must immediately show the country's strength.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of Agriculture Sakurai Cries Out Bitterly, the Result of the Invasion of China Is Human Power Depletion and Raw Material Shortages Are Particularly Serious</h3>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo Correspondence] When recently asked if he felt a lack of manpower supply in Japanese farming villages, Minister of Agriculture Sakurai said that many farming villages felt a sense of insufficient manpower. In addition to the need to draw strong young men for the war against China, thus causing a large-scale depletion of manpower everywhere, farmers from all over the country have also flocked to munitions factories and other factories for work. This phenomenon is most pronounced in villages near large cities. Sakurai also said that the Japanese government authorities had drafted a plan to organize "manpower teams," each team of about fifty people, to be sent to various villages in rotation to help with work during busy farming seasons, and are preparing to increase women's participation in field work and to conscript senior middle school students and junior middle school students to perform service. Sakurai also said that, based on government control, the problem of raw material shortages is even more serious than the manpower problem. Because the government controls iron, farming tools are in short supply. The lack of wire has greatly affected the fruit box manufacturing industry. The plan to allocate fertilizers is also hindered by the lack of kerosene. Engines have to be shut down due to insufficient fuel. At the same time, pesticides for crops are also unavailable.</p>
<h3>Germany Assures Italy Not to Use Force Against Poland, Condition for Concluding Alliance, German-Polish Relations Await German Self-Determination</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 7th] Officials here are unwilling to criticize the alliance between Germany and Italy before fully understanding its truth. However, the feeling here is that the German-Italian alliance is sufficient to weaken Poland's international position in any possible negotiations on the Danzig issue. According to non-official observations, Italy was actually forced to conclude an alliance with Germany, which was not its original intention. Italy is unwilling to cause a European war because of the Danzig issue. At the same time, Mussolini must have obtained Hitler's assurance that he will take easing steps in the future in order to allow mutual conclusion of an alliance with Germany. The Polish government's mouthpiece newspaper hopes that Germany can choose a peaceful path and conduct negotiations based on the program indicated by Burke's speech.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Milan, 7th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that Germany has provided assurance to Italy, declaring that it will never use violence to implement various demands on Poland. In other words, it will not place a fait accompli before Italy. This is the condition for Italy's agreement to sign a political and military alliance. Although Italy has been cooperating militarily with Germany for a long time, it did not agree to the formal conclusion of a treaty of alliance. After Germany repeatedly proposed negotiations, it always treated them with a cold attitude. Now, it finally agreed to sign this alliance because it sincerely hoped that the issue of the Free City of Danzig could be resolved peacefully, which led to the fact that Germany had to abandon its soul-destroying plan for the Free City of Danzig in order to get Italy to accept this alliance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] The "Frankfurter Zeitung" commented today, "Poland and the Western European countries have had an opportunity to reflect. We only hope that they can use it." The newspaper also stated that Hitler's proposal to Poland has received Italy's full support. Italy has never opposed Germany's firm proposal, because otherwise, Italy's sea in Poland will be difficult to navigate freely.</p>

<h3>German Navy and Air Force Conduct Exercises in Denmark</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Copenhagen, 8th] Germany is currently conducting naval exercises in the Øresund and Skagerrak off Bornholm, with 32 warships of various types and aircraft participating. This is the first time that exercises have been held there since the European War.</p>
<h3>British Reply to the Soviet Union: To Be Delivered by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Foreign Minister; Soviet Union and Turkey Agree to Strengthen Friendly Relations; Potemkin Passes Through Bulgaria En Route to Romania</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] The British Ambassador here, Seeds, has received the British government's reply to the Soviet Union's proposal and will visit the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, for discussions. Furthermore, Soviet officials and newspapers are keeping silent about Litvinov's resignation. According to a responsible spokesperson for the Soviet government, due to the severity of the international situation in recent weeks, the press has not criticized diplomatic events, and the government is unwilling to express definite commitments.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 7th] The French Chargé d'Affaires, Béhier, visited the British Ambassador today for talks. The British and French embassies are in close contact.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 7th] The Soviet official news agency reported that the talks between the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, and the Turkish Foreign Minister in Ankara were extremely good. "Both sides are in complete agreement on strengthening friendly relations between the two countries for the benefit of world peace," it said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sofia, Bulgaria, 8th] The Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, met yesterday with King Boris and the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Georgi Kyoseivanov, before leaving for the Romanian capital.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Assures Britain That Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Reports of Rapprochement Between Germany and the Soviet Union Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] This agency has learned that the British government has received assurances from the Soviet Union that, although Litvinov has resigned, Soviet foreign policy remains unchanged.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 7th] There is much speculation about whether the Soviet Union's future foreign policy will change. According to the Politburo, which decides Soviet foreign policy, there will be no sudden changes. Rumors of a rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union are inaccurate, considering the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the situation in the Far East, the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, and the enthusiastic support for President Roosevelt's appeal for peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] Political circles here believe that after the resignation of the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, there is a possibility of a rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union. The most reliable sources believe that this is purely a rumor, but they do not deny the possibility that relations between Germany and Italy will not improve. The rumors of a rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union are based on: (1) Litvinov's resignation, as Litvinov was Jewish; (2) "Pravda" commented on Molotov but did not attack him; (3) German newspapers have not attacked the Soviet Union recently; (4) The Hamburger Fremdenblatt editorial yesterday stated that after Litvinov's resignation, the ideological obstacles between Germany and the Soviet Union could be removed; (5) According to reports from Tokyo, Germany threatened Japan that if it did not change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance, it would reach an understanding with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Vast Expanse of Sea and Sky: The Royal Yacht and Escorting Ships Sail Through Rain and Fog</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] A dispatch from the Reuters correspondent on board the British Royal Yacht "Empress of Australia" en route to Canada reports: "We are now sailing in the rain, with a slight swell and a slight rocking of the ship. The King and Queen are quite able to withstand the waves. Although it is raining, all the scheduled events are proceeding as usual. Even in the Atlantic Ocean, our journey is well-organized. We passed five escort ships, which patrolled close to the yacht and sounded their whistles to show respect. Last night, the King and Queen dined with the royal family and then listened to the orchestra on board, which included "The Blue Danube" waltz and a theme song from the film "Snow White." This morning, we entered heavy fog and reduced speed. The whistles of the yacht and the escort ships echoed each other. The heavy fog cleared at 8:00 a.m. We are now sailing in a vast expanse of sea and sky in light rain."</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Bans Political Special Schools</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ta Kung Pao Evening News published a dispatch from Chongqing stating that the Ministry of Education has ordered all provincial education departments, schools at all levels, and other relevant parties to ban political special schools. We believe that this news deserves attention: firstly, because the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction movement has entered a new and arduous stage, we must overcome new difficulties and strive for final victory. We must ensure that the national education system serves the cause of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and any violations of this supreme principle should be banned. Secondly, the Japanese invasion of China is gradually entering a stage of difficulty and failure. In order to save their crisis, they are intensifying their political conspiracies. Traitors and national betrayers, such as ×××, are using various methods to spread their "anti-Communist peace" and other capitulationist theories and activities in cultural circles, especially in education. This activity already exists among overseas Chinese, in occupied areas, and even in some areas of the rear. Therefore, it is necessary to ban this kind of educational organization.</p>
<p>However, we believe that, firstly, a ban based solely on an official order will not have much effect. We must also carry out extensive publicity and explanation work, mobilize the power of the masses, and conduct a tenacious struggle. Secondly, at the same time, we must actively encourage all educational institutions that do not violate the supreme principles of the revolutionary Three People's Principles and serve the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and actively consolidate and expand state-run and public educational institutions. Since the War of Resistance, the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University and the Shaanbei Public School in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have, in accordance with the supreme principles of the revolutionary Three People's Principles, and in order to meet the urgent needs of serving the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, successively cultivated thousands of young cadres for the country and the nation, supplementing the front lines, penetrating behind enemy lines, and serving the rear areas again and again, even five or six times. Over the past two years, they have made the greatest contribution to the cause of Chinese national liberation. We hope that the government authorities will provide unified guidance and leadership, and provide practical support and assistance to these schools and similar educational institutions, regardless of party affiliation or regional origin. If we do not support this kind of War of Resistance and National Reconstruction education while banning traitors and pro-Japanese factions, we will certainly not achieve the desired results. If we broadly ban all "political special schools" on the grounds that they are "unapproved," and even allow traitors and national betrayers to carry out conspiracies in "approved" schools, then we have nothing to say but protest! For the sake of the future of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, we cannot but demand that the government pay close attention to this!</p>
<h3>A Comprehensive Discussion of the Current International Situation (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liao Chong Sheng</p>
<p>Not only that, but Soviet Russia's contribution to world peace is even greater than passive tolerance. Last year, when the Czech crisis became increasingly acute, the Soviet Union, in order to fulfill its treaty obligations, declared on September 21st through Litvinov: "The Soviet military authorities, in view of the current situation, are prepared to immediately consult with the military leaders of France and Czechoslovakia to consider the steps that should be taken immediately." On the eve of the signing of the Munich Agreement, Litvinov solemnly warned the powers: "The spirit of the League of Nations should not avoid a crisis in which war and peace are still uncertain, but lead to an inevitable great war in the future!" In reiterating his country's solemn position, he further stated: "The Soviet Union does not condone this kind of politics (referring to sacrificing weak countries in order to seek temporary security through concessions). It feels honored and will have no intention of violating this policy in the future. It firmly believes that in the current situation, there is no way to guarantee genuine peace other than this path (collective security). What the Soviet Union expects from the powers is nothing more than to return to this path." From this, the firmness of the Soviet attitude can be said to be as clear as looking at one's palm.</p>
<p>4. The Shift in Polish and Romanian Diplomacy</p>
<p>Poland and Romania are located between Soviet Russia and Western Europe. After the war, in order to defend against the Soviet Union, they formed an alliance with each other. Today, with the rapprochement between Western European democratic countries and the Soviet Union, Poland and Romania are undoubtedly a major key, both geographically and politically. Therefore, their diplomatic trends cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Polish diplomacy, under the leadership of Foreign Minister Beck, has always been known for its "balancing act." In recent years, because France's power in Southeastern Europe has declined, it has not hesitated to collude with Germany to satisfy its long-held desire to annex the coal-rich and railway and highway transportation hub of Czech Teschen, and to complete its dream of Poland and Hungary bordering each other. The signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact five years ago marked the beginning of mutual friendship. However, good times are hard to last. After the Munich Conference, although the desire to seize Teschen was fulfilled, the dream of bordering each other was not realized, and Poland itself had become a restricted area for Germany's eastward expansion. Better late than never. Beck's diplomatic policy underwent a significant change. The renewal of the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on November 26th last year was the beginning of its shift. At that time, Polish public opinion unanimously praised it, and even the far-right newspapers that advocated anti-communism recognized this move as "timely and important." As for the semi-official mouthpiece of the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kuryer Krakqwski), in commenting on the Ukrainian issue, it further stated that "Germany has used Ruthenia as its base for directing anti-Soviet and anti-Polish activities. However, even today, Germany and the Ukrainians must thoroughly understand that if the Ukrainian issue is used as an excuse for anti-Soviet and anti-Polish activities, the result will only be to increase the understanding between the Soviet Union and Poland."</p>
<p>Because Germany still needs to utilize Poland, it suddenly adopted a restrained attitude towards Poland and sent its Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Warsaw on January 25th of this year to return the visit. After two days of detailed talks, although the Polish authorities claimed that the negotiations were extremely "satisfactory" and that "all doubts had been dispelled," in fact, Foreign Minister Beck's attitude was unexpectedly tough, and all of Germany's requests, such as further concessions on the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway across the Pomeranian province of northern Poland, were rejected. Moreover, the important mission undertaken by the German Foreign Minister was to inquire about what attitude Poland would take if Germany and Italy were to pressure Western Europe. In fact, Germany desires Poland to maintain neutrality for two reasons: (1) to prevent Poland from fulfilling the Franco-Polish alliance and attacking Germany's rear; (2) if Stalin fulfills the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, Poland's neutrality can prevent Russia from using Poland as a passage to aid France. However, Beck refused to provide any guarantees on this matter, and resolutely declared that Poland must reserve its right to act according to its own convenience, so that when the time comes, it can make a final decision based on its own interests.</p>
<p>Since Poland's attitude is as described above, Romania, which is in the same boat, can hardly allow itself to be outdone. In order to coordinate the positions of the two countries, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu visited Warsaw in early March of this year. As a result of three days of negotiations, Gafencu expressed understanding of the issue of Poland and Hungary bordering each other, and recognized that Germany's use of conquered Czechoslovakia and Nazi-ized Ruthenia as a base for encroaching on Romania was a concern that was even greater than Hungary's ambition to revise the treaty. In order to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, both sides agreed: (1) to adopt a "more active" policy towards the Balkans and the Danube region, (2) to excavate canals and expand highways to connect the Baltic Sea with the Black Sea. (According to this plan, it is proposed to connect the Vistula, Dniester, Pruth, and Danube rivers, which would have significant economic, political, and strategic significance. 3) Today, Poland and Romania no longer have reason to suspect that Soviet Russia intends to invade. On the contrary, from now on, they should adopt a more friendly attitude towards Russia politically and economically.</p>
<p>5. Will Hitler Not Hesitate to Start a World War?</p>
<p>The alliance of democratic countries was originally intended to maintain international order and eliminate war in its infancy, and was not deliberately intended to embarrass autocratic countries. Today's war and peace really only depend on the thoughts of dictators, especially Hitler. From a realistic standpoint, the choice between war and peace should be determined by the strength and weakness of his country. In recent years, Germany has actively expanded its military by mobilizing the country's manpower, financial resources, and material resources in the manner of a wartime controlled economy. Its army and air force equipment may be slightly better than those of Britain and France in some respects. Moreover, before the Munich Conference, Czechoslovakia, with its military strength, could restrain 40 divisions of the German army. Now, this large army can be used for other purposes. In terms of manpower, even if the Czech people of Bohemia and Moravia are not reliable, among the 3.5 million people in the Sudetenland, there are still 300,000 trained men available for his use. There is no doubt that its military strength has increased.</p>
<p>The fullness of military strength and the excellence of equipment are certainly one of the main conditions for war, but under the principle of national strength warfare, food, raw materials, and financial resources are the ultimate key to victory. This is almost universally known.</p>
<p>In terms of food, today's Germany is not much different from the time of the European War, and imports account for about one-fifth of the total national consumption. Since annexing Czechoslovakia, its food panic has greatly decreased because it is close to agricultural countries such as Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. However, in the aforementioned areas, Germany also controlled much of them during the European War, but due to the impact of the war, production was reduced, and it was ultimately unable to provide Germany with sufficient demand. Based on this perspective, Germany's food problem still cannot be regarded as fundamentally solved, no wonder its desire for Ukraine is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Hong Kong's Naval Strength: Five British Warships Ordered to Hong Kong for Reinforcement; Aircraft Carrier "Eagle" Leaves Singapore to Return to Hong Kong; Commander Noble Promoted to Admiral and Remains Stationed in the Far East</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen Hong Kong's naval strength to cope with the perilous situation in the Far East, the British authorities have specially increased the deployment of fleets to the East for joint defense. According to naval sources in Hong Kong, two newly built cruisers and destroyers have recently arrived in Hong Kong and are expected to arrive on the 21st of this month. In addition, two modern shallow-water gunboats will also come to the East. The two gunboats are named "Dragonfly" and "Grasshopper," with a displacement of 585 tons each. The ships can accommodate 74 sailors and are equipped with four-inch guns. The "Dragonfly" passed through Singapore on the 5th of this month and sailed to Hong Kong on the 6th, while the "Grasshopper" will arrive in Hong Kong on the 16th. The above-mentioned ships will join the British Far East Fleet in the future. Also, the aircraft carrier "Eagle," which left Hong Kong a month ago to participate in the war games in Singapore, was docked in Singapore for repairs and left Singapore to return to Hong Kong during the day. Hong Kong's fleet strength will be greatly strengthened. In addition, Rear Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, has been appointed to China. The British Emperor, in recognition of his hard work and meritorious service, has issued an order to promote him to Admiral and remain Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet. His Admiral flag was hoisted on the flagship "Kent" yesterday morning. Noble succeeded Admiral Little as Commander of the Far East Fleet a few years ago. He was born in 1880 and joined the Navy in 1894, at the age of only 14. From 1935 to 1937, he served as the Fourth Sea Lord and the Director of Naval Supplies. In 1929, he was honorably appointed by the British Emperor to accompany the Navy.</p>

<p>Special Feature of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>The All-Circles Relief Association Launches a Full-Scale Fundraising Effort; The China Salvation Drama Troupe Schedules Regular Performances; The China Amateur Students' Association Welcomed the "China Salvation" Troupe Last Night and Presented a Banner</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Since the China Salvation Drama Troupe began preparing to go abroad for publicity and arrived in Hong Kong, a surge of "welcome" and "celebration" has erupted. As for their plays? Because of their careful preparations, they have not yet been able to meet with us. "Perform quickly!" "Perform quickly!" Many people are sincerely anticipating this.</p>
<p>Over the past month, the "China Salvation" friends have been simultaneously preparing for their departure procedures and rehearsing new plays, maintaining the same spirit of tension and hard work as they did when serving on the battlefield. Their departure time is scheduled for the beginning of next month; and performances? There are already signs of progress. This is something readers will be happy to hear!</p>
<p>Currently, the Hong Kong Relief of Refugee Joint Committee, admiring the troupe's outstanding achievements and spiritual dramatic art in their past work in the country, has specially resolved to request the troupe to perform a large-scale charity performance for the committee before their departure, in order to expand salvation publicity and raise funds for wounded soldiers and refugees. Members have already been dispatched to obtain the troupe's consent. At the same time, the China Journalists' Association is in charge of this performance, and the Four Women's Associations, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Chung Sing Charitable Society, the China Arts Association, and other organizations have been elected to form a charity performance special committee, responsible for handling the matter. Yesterday afternoon, the first meeting was held at the Journalists' Association, attended by committee members Li Jianfeng, Liu Qingjian, Jin Guomian, Lu Fu, Li Bokang, Zhuang Feixu, Yao Shangqin, Li Shaoming, and more than ten others. Mr. Jin Shan, head of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, and Mr. Lin Shu were invited to attend. After detailed discussions, the main points decided were: 1. Performance time: The 25th, 26th, and 27th of this month, for three consecutive evenings. 2. Performance repertoire: "Defend the Motherland" on the first night, "Long Live the Nation" on the second night, and "The Spring of Taierzhuang" on the third night. 3. Ticket prices: Divided into five types: 10 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, 2 dollars, and 3 dollars. (4) The scripts will be submitted to the Chinese Affairs Department for review. The Salvation Drama Troupe is requested to send the scripts to the committee within three days. (5) The Relief Association will first allocate 300 Hong Kong dollars to this special committee for performance expenses. (6) Mr. Lu Guomian of the Chung Sing Charitable Society is requested to handle the exemption from entertainment tax. (7) Charity performance publicity matters: News publicity will be handled by Mr. Zhuang Feixu, and special publications, text, art, and printing publicity matters will be handled by Mr. Lu Fu.</p>
<p>Currently, in addition to actively rehearsing various great plays, the China Salvation Drama Troupe has also begun to produce magnificent scenery and lighting. It is believed that the significance, artistic refinement, grandeur of scenery, and wonder of lighting of this performance will break any theater troupe's performance records. What is especially worth noting is that for this performance, except for the theater rental, all scenery, equipment, and performance expenses will be borne by the troupe. It is said that the scenery alone has reached more than 2,000 dollars, which is an unprecedented and meaningful event in the Hong Kong theater world.</p>
<p>There is also something noteworthy to report about the troupe's activities and influence:</p>
<p>Last night at 10:30 PM, the China Amateur Student Association's welcome party for the China Salvation Drama Troupe was not only enthusiastic, but also quite extraordinary in its style.</p>
<p>After Principal Wu Hanzhen delivered a speech expressing his respect, Mr. Fang Yu Yan, the Director of Studies, said that the purpose of the China Salvation Drama Troupe is "salvation of the nation" and "national salvation," and what we learn in school is also "salvation of the nation" and "national salvation." Therefore, we must join hands, stand together, and have friendly and joyful celebrations.</p>
<p>Mr. Fang also solemnly said:</p>
<p>There are several points that the China Salvation Drama Troupe is worth learning from, to encourage all students:</p>
<p>(1) High enthusiasm; (2) Hard work, quick work, and practical work; (3) Common ideals, common goals, and common actions; (4) Dedication to one's career; (5) Growing in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction; (6) Taking workers, farmers, and soldiers as teachers; (7) Nation above all, nation above all.</p>
<p>This is a lesson in practical life education for the school. This style, this spirit, needless to say, is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Next, Principal Wu presented a banner on behalf of all the faculty and students. Amidst enthusiastic applause, Mr. Jin accepted the banner on behalf of the troupe. The banner was made of satin with white characters, magnificent and majestic, with the inscription "Awaken High Enthusiasm, Unite to Rescue the Motherland."</p>
<p>The speeches of the leaders, Jin Shan and Wang Ying, were sincere in their attitude and moving in their content, making people feel very excited after listening.</p>
<p>Because there were many programs and not enough time, Director Lin Shu and several friends of the troupe made separate appointments to give speeches. A symposium followed, with the topic: "How to bring realistic works to the stage." This topic was aroused by the students of the school in their studies, using collectivist self-education as a method of life education. This style is very worthy of promotion, especially in Hong Kong. After the enthusiastic symposium, there was also entertainment to add to the fun. They moved each other, learned from each other, and all wanted to grow in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction!</p>
<h3>More Than 3,000 Unemployed Teachers from War Zones Remain in Hong Kong; Many Schools in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau Generously Agree to Lend Their Premises to Relieve Unemployed Refugee Children</h3>
<p>In order to provide relief to unemployed teachers and staff and out-of-school refugee children who have withdrawn from the war zones, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education recently set up registration offices in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau to facilitate the registration of war zone personnel and students from all sides. It has been underway for many days now. According to the Confucius Society, there are currently more than 100 teachers from the war zones, and many are continuing to register. According to general teachers who have come to Hong Kong, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, more than 3,000 unemployed teachers have come to Hong Kong. As for the matter of borrowing school buildings from Hong Kong, Macau, and overseas Chinese schools to set up schools to teach out-of-school refugee children, it is also actively underway. Yesterday, executive members of the Out-of-School Refugee Children Relief Association discussed six methods for borrowing overseas Chinese school buildings at the new office located at No. 1 Caine Road. They immediately assigned staff to be responsible for different districts, carrying the methods to contact various schools. It is said that each school believes that relieving out-of-school refugees is the responsibility of people in the education sector, and is a good opportunity to serve the motherland, and many have automatically agreed. It is estimated that more than 30 schools, including the Overseas Chinese Middle School, De Ming Middle School, and the Affiliated Middle School of Min Da, have agreed to lend their premises. The rest are still in the process of negotiation.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Manufacturers Will Invest in Macau, Pending the Decision of Detailed Measures by Macau</h3>
<p>After the return of the Macau Investigation Group of the Chinese Manufacturers' Union, the issue of investment by manufacturers in Hong Kong in Macau has become quite a stir. Macau's conditions for industrial development, except for transportation, are quite well-prepared. Recently, there has been progress in this matter, and the extent to which it will reach has attracted much attention from the community. According to Han Suixuan, the Director-General of the Union, the Union is currently waiting for Macau to send detailed maps of the land, factory regulations, and preferential conditions, which will then be studied. Because investment is only in its initial stages, it should be thoroughly reviewed. Regarding the organization of a delegation of Macau gentry and merchants to Hong Kong for a courtesy visit, newspapers have repeatedly reported on it, but the Chinese Manufacturers' Union has not yet received any news from Macau.</p>
<h3>War of Resistance Special Feature Draws Crowds and Receives Raves; A Shame-Erasing Donation Will Be Held Today</h3>
<p>The "War of Resistance Special Feature, Volume 6," produced by the Political Department of the Military Commission and the China Film Studio, has been screened at the Central Theater for several days, drawing crowds and receiving rave reviews from various newspapers, which have strongly recommended it. Today, May 9th, is the National Humiliation Memorial Day. The theater will hold a shame-erasing donation today. The income from the three screenings of this film during the day will be entirely handed over to the Bank of China to be contributed to the National Government to help the War of Resistance. It is also heard that half-price tickets will be valid for both day and night screenings of this film from today.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Education Authorities Improve the Education System, Raise the Quality of Teachers; Training Classes Will Begin in September; Monthly Educational Administration Expenses Have Gradually Increased</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's education, due to its special circumstances, has many shortcomings and is particularly detached from the domestic education system. In recent years, Chinese and foreign educators have criticized this. The Hong Kong education authorities are also aware of this and are eager to improve it. They have considered issues such as the quality of teachers, funding, and the education system, and have formulated improvement measures. Some of these plans have already been implemented, and the rest can also be implemented in the short term. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Neglecting Vocational Education</p>
<p>The unsoundness of Hong Kong's education system has been pointed out by Chinese and foreign educators for many years. The most prominent shortcomings are roughly the following: (1) In English schools, there is too much emphasis on general education, and vocational education is neglected. In addition to studying at the University of Hong Kong and studying abroad, the way out for middle school graduates is government agencies and foreign firms. Few enter other professions. The reason for this is the lack of vocational training. (2) In Chinese schools, the curriculum and student level are not aligned with those of domestic schools, especially in physics and chemistry. After graduation, students who want to go to the University of Hong Kong find it difficult to be admitted due to their English proficiency. It is not easy to go to schools in China, and employment is even more uncertain. (3) The poor quality of teachers is one of the main reasons for the unsoundness of education in Hong Kong, and improving the quality of teachers must start with teacher training. In recent years, the authorities have also realized that there is a need to improve the shortcomings of education in Hong Kong, and have specially commissioned education experts to preside over the matter. The current Director of Education, Mr. Sorrell, is a well-known education expert.</p>
<p>Improving Teacher Training</p>
<p>The change in the start of the school year has already been implemented a few years ago, so that it aligns with the schools in China. Currently, schools in Hong Kong have changed from starting in the spring to starting in the fall. Secondly, the biggest measure of the education authorities is to improve the quality of teachers. The teacher training school run by the Education Department is scheduled to open in September. The location has been selected as the old National Academy, which is currently being renovated. Classes will be taught in Chinese and English, with a training period of one year. After graduation, they will be assigned to teach in various public and private schools.</p>
<p>Increasing Education Funding</p>
<p>As for the original Chinese Women's Normal School of the Education Department, most of its graduates have already served in the education sector. In order to reward each school for employing graduates of the school, the education authorities have specially stipulated the grading of school subsidies, which is determined by the number of graduates of the school employed. Those who employ four or more people are first-class subsidized schools, those who employ three people are second-class subsidized schools, those who employ two people are third-class subsidized schools, and those who employ one person are fourth-class subsidized schools. Because the Education Department has been carrying out various educational improvement works in recent years, the funding has greatly increased. The monthly expenditure has exceeded 100,000 dollars, and last month it reached 438,306 dollars.</p>

<h3>Four Thieves Robbed a House in Lion Rock Road, Kowloon City, in Broad Daylight; Claimed to be Renting a Room to Commit the Crime; One Suspect Was Arrested; The Victim Lost Gold and Silver Jewelry Worth More Than One Thousand Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a household in Lion Rock Road, Kowloon City, was robbed by four thieves who claimed to be renting a room, barging in during broad daylight. As a result, they stole more than one thousand dollars. Afterwards, one suspect was arrested. The case occurred on the fourth floor of No. 37 Lion Rock Road, Kowloon City. The victim was a refugee woman named Wu Mei (22 years old), who had just moved into the house on the 6th of this month. At 11:20 AM yesterday morning, she was sitting idle at home after lunch when suddenly four thieves, two of whom were wearing suits, barged in with knives, claiming to be renting a room. After entering the house, they immediately threatened Wu with knives, forcing her to hand over the key to the safe. Seeing that the thieves were fierce as tigers, Wu did not dare to refuse, so she handed over the key to the thieves. The thieves tied up everyone and searched the house, eventually stealing 490 Hong Kong dollars, 400 provincial currency dollars, eight gold rings, two gold necklaces, and three gold earrings, totaling 410 dollars worth of gold items. After the thieves succeeded, they fled. Not long after the thieves left, a resident of No. 35 heard a loud alarm and chased after the thieves. When the four thieves ran to Hau Wong Road, a Chinese constable happened to be passing by and arrested one suspect. Suspecting that he was related to the case, he took him back to the police station to file a case.</p>

<h3>The Enemy Near Shun De is Restless, Attempting to Threaten Zhongshan; Defend Jiangmen to the Death; Zhang Fa-kui Dispatches Personnel to Inspect Zhongshan's Defenses, Strengthening Our Team is on High Alert; If They Invade, We Will Strike Them Hard</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Quick News] Enemy warships frequently come and go in the waters of Zhongshan. County Magistrate Zhang is making every effort to complete war preparations and mobilize the masses to resist the enemy, with considerable success. Zhang Fa-kui, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, has a comprehensive plan for the defense of Zhongshan. Provincial Government Member Wu Fei was also ordered to supervise the anti-Japanese guerrillas in Zhongshan. Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang also dispatched Senior Staff Officer Zhuo An to inspect Zhongshan's wartime measures, strengthening the area. Staff Officer Zhuo arrived in Shi Qi on the 7th via Macau and immediately summoned Zhang Hui, Yuan Dai, and others to discuss military strategies in detail. He also went to various places to inspect the war situation. He returned north after a week to report. It is now found that the number of enemy troops on the border between Zhongshun and Zhongxin has been increasing in recent days, seemingly intending to harass Zhongshan. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Enemy Harassment on the Shun De Border</p>
<p>After capturing Hui Cheng and Jiangmen, the enemy intends to consolidate the outer lines of Jiangmen and Hui Cheng. They have increased by eight enemy shallow-water warships and more than ten rubber boats, which are docked in the Beitou Street area of Jiangmen, attempting to launch surprise attacks on our team at any time. In recent days, the number of enemy soldiers in the area of ​​He Tang and Cang Yuan outside of the new Zhongbian border has increased by more than 200. On the 5th and 6th of this month, the enemy artillery in Wai Hai bombarded our Haizhou Ancient Town positions more than ten times, without any response from our team. At the same time, the enemy forces in Ronggui on the border of Shun De have also increased slightly, with several enemy boats patrolling in Dahuangpu, not daring to invade. Our team is on alert, and we will strike them hard if they invade.</p>
<p>No Major Increases or Decreases in Zhongshan Enemy Warships</p>
<p>There have been no major increases or decreases in enemy warships along the coast of Zhongshan this week. There are three enemy warships off the coast of Gao Lan. Near Sanzao Island, there are two enemy cruisers and one destroyer off the coast between Daganmen and Huangzhou, with no abnormalities. Enemy warships are often seen in the waters of Jiuzhou, and their movements are mysterious. The enemy on Jiuzhou Mountain has not yet withdrawn. Two enemy armed fishing boats docked off the coast of Xiazaizi sailed towards Lingdingyang on the evening of the 7th, but returned on the morning of the 8th and are still patrolling near Fox Hill. There are no enemy troops in Tangjiawan Bay. On the 6th and 7th, more than ten enemy motorized boats were found in the waters of Dahuangpu, transporting grain and military supplies to Ronggui. They were attacked by our team along the way. The enemy motorboats also opened fire with machine guns at our distance and fled in a panic.</p>
<p>Jiujiang Enemy Warships Threaten Gaohe</p>
<p>In addition, enemy troops have been lying dormant on the north and south banks of the lower reaches of the West River in recent days. Our military teams took the opportunity to attack Sanshui, Hekou, Ganggen, Makou, Guanyao, and Fengyong, where the enemy was caught off guard. According to intelligence obtained here on the 7th in Heshan, two enemy shallow-water warships, seven transport vessels, twelve steamships, and more than thirty rubber boats are still docked in the waters of Jiujiangxi Hai. On the morning of the 7th, enemy warships traveled back and forth along the Taiping River and Qingshakou, patrolling and chasing, and occasionally firing cannons and guns at the opposite bank, which seemed to be a drill, attempting to intimidate our Gao (Ming) He (Shan) defenders. According to military information, after the enemy warships conducted drills on the Jiujiang River, a batch of them passed through Zhoujun on the evening of the 7th and sailed towards the Dahuangpu River off Ying Gezui. It is said that this batch of enemy warships was exercising down the West River from Hekou.</p>
<h3>Indiscriminate Harassment, Enemy Aircraft Still Bomb Shantou, Many Houses Destroyed, Few Civilian Casualties, Authorities Intensify Evacuation of Residents Remaining in the City</h3>
<p>(Shantou Special Dispatch) Enemy aircraft attacked Shantou again on the 6th, with many stray bullets. Fortunately, the city residents had already fled, so the casualties were less than in the previous two days. As of the morning of the 7th, it was reported that two enemy aircraft carriers and two patrol and destroyer vessels were still hovering between the Linghai Mountains, so before dawn, mountains everywhere were crowded with people. The military and anti-aircraft units were on high alert. Foreign consulates also notified the employees of foreign firms to temporarily suspend business. The actual situation of the enemy aircraft bombing Shantou on the 6th of this month is recorded below. At 8:15 AM, eight enemy aircraft took off from enemy warships and aircraft carriers overseas. After entering the scarf area, they immediately dropped bombs on Qi Lu and Hua Wu. Three bombs landed on the old East District Pacification Commissioner's Office in Conglong, destroying the entire building. Several nearby houses were damaged. Several bombs landed on the cemetery next to Municipal No. 1 Middle School, slightly shaking the school building. Fortunately, the school had already moved inland, and there were no casualties. A bomb also landed in front of the Huang Family Ancestral Hall at Huajiadutou, destroying more than ten houses and injuring one person. At 9:00 AM, they fled overseas. At 9:30 AM, the batch of enemy aircraft attacked again, and after passing through Mazu Island towards the city, followed the Chaoshan Railway to Chaoan, dropping bombs madly in Chaoan City. Nineteen bombs landed on the electric light bureau, the railway station, and the agricultural and forestry farm nursery, destroying more than ten houses and killing several civilians. After wreaking havoc, they attacked Jieyang, dropping eight bombs on the Quxi Sugar Factory. The losses are still being investigated. At 10:30 AM, they returned to the city from Jieyang, dropping three bombs on Yongxiang Street and four bombs on Tongjin Street, all landing in the sea without any casualties. Then, they strafed the city with machine guns before leaving past Mazu Island and going out to sea. At 3:40 PM, they attacked for the third time, dropping 20 bombs on the area around Wuqiao and Hanti Road. The Wuqiao Tonghua Canned Food Factory was completely destroyed. The Chaoan line was also affected, and several civilian houses were destroyed. More than ten shops and collapsed grounds on the bridge along the Han River tributary were also affected. The Mainland Factory was also in ruins. Yongantang and Xinghua Newspaper on Hanti Road were damaged by the tremors. At about 5:00 PM, when the bombs were exhausted, they swept towards Chaoyang Jitou with guns. The Lihua Fuchun electric ship was also attacked and lasted for about half an hour. It is estimated that although many bombs were dropped that day, because the citizens had already fled, there were only three deaths and seven injuries. After the enemy's tragic bombing, people moved to the inland, and the population has been reduced by more than half. There are about 60,000 to 70,000 citizens left in the city. Many people take refuge at the foot of the mountains every day. The authorities are stepping up the evacuation, and young women are also ordered to move inland. Prostitutes must leave the city within five days, otherwise they will be assigned to the war work team. In recent days, boats and cars have been closing the gate and sailing at night, and passengers are crowded. On the 5th, a Guangzhou ship coming from Jie collided with a wooden cargo ship in Hong Kong, causing a tragic accident, killing and injuring more than 20 people.</p>

<p>(Shaoguan Special Dispatch) After the main force of the Guangdong enemy withdrew from Jiangmen Xinhui, they concentrated in Guangzhou and continued to move to the West River, seemingly intending to spy on Gaoyao. However, some of the enemy troops are still distributed in Jiangcun, to prevent our army from counterattacking and cutting off their retreat on the West River. As for the enemy troops in the Northeast River, they are currently building fortifications in a hurry, attempting to defend to the death.</p>
<h3>Provincial Party Department Sets a Deadline for All Organizations to Report; Withdrawing Organizations Must Move to Shao</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Correspondence) The Guangdong Provincial Party Department, because Guangzhou was lost last year, and various mass organizations withdrew safely to other places one after another, losing contact. They have been asked to concentrate in Shaoguan to engage in national salvation. In particular, the General Report of the Withdrawn Civil Organizations in Guangzhou City will be held, ordering all to concentrate in Shaoguan for handling within the deadline. It has been set from May 1st to June 15th as the period for reporting the withdrawal process of all sectors in Guangzhou City.

<h3>Social Service Work in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Yu Senwen, the secretary-general of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, in the first section of Chapter 3 of his work report on the Guangdong Provincial Social Service Office, "Reflections on Managing the Guangdong Provincial Capital Service Office," stated, "Since the success of the Northern Expedition by our Party, the unification of China, and the assumption of power, under the leadership of the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the foundation of the nation has become increasingly solid, and national policies have been renewed daily. Various undertakings have shown tremendous progress and vitality. However, local Party headquarters have often failed to exert their utmost efforts in promoting social endeavors, and local Party members have not fully participated in serving the masses. This not only fails to fulfill the responsibility of leading, awakening, and helping the people, but also risks separating the Party from the masses. Recognizing this, the central government has firmly ordered Party headquarters at all levels to promote social service undertakings and establish social service offices. Since the establishment of the Social Service Office in this province, we have deeply felt that it is indeed sufficient to attract the broad masses and gain their sympathy. If it can be popularized throughout the country and widely promoted, then the Party's principles and platform will surely penetrate the masses, gaining their understanding, belief, and support. Moreover, as we are in the second phase of the War of Resistance, our Party, as the ruling party leading the national resistance and nation-building, must devote all our efforts to this social service undertaking that garners the most sympathy from the people." This demonstrates the significance and importance of the central government's order to promote social service undertakings.</p>
<p>The Social Service Office of Guangdong Province was established in Qujiang on February 15th of this year. In the two months or so since then, the projects that have been carried out include: (1) Establishing a personal consultation office, with content divided into (A) handling guidance for further education and employment, (B) handling tourist guidance, (C) handling public document drafting, (D) handling legal and medical inquiries; (2) Establishing a job placement agency, with content including (A) registering unemployed individuals, (B) accepting commissions to find talent, (C) introducing unemployed individuals to employment; (3) Holding public education classes, with content including (A) children's remedial classes, (B) women's remedial classes, (C) women's lecture classes, (D) children's choir, (E) women's choir; (4) Establishing a tourist communication registration office; (5) Establishing public lectures; (6) Establishing a passenger guidance office at the Shaoguan Station of the Yuehan Railway; (7) Establishing a public newspaper reading area; (8) Holding a spring smallpox vaccination campaign; (9) Organizing a confectionery labor corps.</p>
<p>The projects that are in preparation include: (1) preparing to set up a bookstore; (2) preparing to set up a public hostel; (3) preparing to set up a public clinic; (4) preparing to set up a refugee vocational training center; (5) a consumer cooperative; (6) an emergency rescue team. These are all urgent tasks that need to be completed quickly, especially in Qujiang. The newly established headquarters, lacking fundamental resources, needs material support, such as solving the difficulties of food and lodging, the lack of spiritual food, the shortage of daily necessities, and the rudimentary medical treatment. All of these require immediate remedies.</p>

<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<h3>Premiere Performance by the Central Photography Studio: National Defense Drama "Battle" Written by Zhang Min, Directed and Starring Zhao Dan, with Bai Yang and Gu Eryi</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Communication] Since the unprecedented War of Resistance against Japan in Chinese history, Shanghai, which has always been a hub for film and drama, has seen many people immediately leave this place and head to the interior. In the past twenty-two months, these drama workers have gone deep into the war zones and villages, using drama as a bridge to connect the generally sluggish rural areas and the common people with the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>I remember that Jin Shan once wrote a wartime drama communication, in which he mentioned that there was a local gentry who owned many guns and armed farmers. He did not express his opinion on this war of resistance. So, when they performed a drama (a drama that aroused the passion for national salvation), they invited this gentleman to watch it. After watching the drama, the gentleman stood up very moved and firmly stated that he would definitely do his best to fight the invaders. This small example shows how great the mission of national salvation drama is.</p>
<p>This group of film and drama workers, except for Wang Xianzhai, Jia Jiachen, Sun Min, Tang Jie, Xu Xinyuan, and others who have returned to Shanghai, the rest, such as Lan Ping, Li Lin, and Zuo Ming, are all in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, engaged in drama work. Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Cai Chusheng, Fei Mu, and Ouyang Yuqian are staying in Hong Kong to continue making films.</p>
<p>General Shanghai directors, such as Ying Yunwei, Shi Dongshan, and Hong Shen, are neighbors in Chongqing. Many famous Shanghai actors have joined the Central Photography Studio. This Central Photography Studio, centered on Shanghai directors and actors, has produced many war of resistance newsreels and films on the theme of war of resistance in one year.</p>
<p>Recently, all the staff of the Central Photography Studio have prepared another large-scale public performance. The lineup of performers is rare in inland performances, and most of them are acquaintances from Shanghai.</p>
<p>The drama performed this time is a five-act national defense drama called "Battle." The playwright is Zhang Min, who used to direct "Romeo and Juliet" and "The Thunderstorm" for the amateur experimental theater. The director in charge is Zhao Dan, a well-known young actor in Shanghai. The "stage manager" is Gu Eryi, who became famous as the county magistrate in "Carnival Night," and Zhu Jinming, who is best at "amateur" lighting.</p>
<p>As for the actors, there are even more familiar actors, such as Bai Yang, Lu Chao, Wei Heling, Gu Eryi, Xian Qianli, etc., and all the actors of the Central Photography Studio. The theater for the public performance is the Cathay Grand Theater. Although we have not seen this performance, we can definitely imagine the enthusiasm and success of the public performance.</p>
<h3>Representative Works of Hollywood Movie Stars (Continued)</h3>
<p>Marlene Dietrich: Josef von Sternberg's "Desire" and Mammoulian's "The Song of Songs" are both worth cherishing repeatedly. In terms of emotion, "The Song of Songs" is superior to "Desire" by far.</p>
<p>Loretta Young: Loretta Young has several color costume films, but none of them are as good as her comedies. Among Loretta's comedies, "The Farmer's Daughter" is the most outstanding.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert: Undoubtedly, "Cleopatra" is Claudette's crowning achievement.</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn: "Little Women" and "Quality Street" are most suitable for Katharine Hepburn's personality. In terms of comparative achievement, the latter seems to be more moving than the former.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy: Myrna Loy's "The Thin Man" and "Manhattan Melodrama" both have wonderful performances.</p>
<p>Sylvia Sidney: Movie fans all know that "Madame Butterfly" is Sylvia Sidney's immortal work, but "Fury" is also not weak.</p>
<p>Alice Faye: In terms of segments, Alice Faye has an extremely outstanding performance in "Alexander's Ragtime Band." Among the starring works, "Lillian Russell" should be recommended.</p>
<p>Sonja Henie: Sonja's skating art is most praised in "One in a Million."</p>
<p>Merle Oberon: In America, she starred in "The Cowboy and the Lady" and "These Three," and in England, she starred in "The Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>
<p>Ginger Rogers: For dance films, "Shall We Dance" is the first choice, and for acting films, "Kitty Foyle" is recommended.</p>

<h3>Husband, Wife, Friend (6)</h3>
<p>Miss Carver then said, "Then why don't you come to my apartment on Doster Street to see me?"</p>
<p>Leona hesitated for a moment and said, "Okay, I'll come right away."</p>
<p>After a few words of idle talk, Miss Carver told him the truth, although Torrance's singing voice was good, it wasn't anything great. The applause from the audience at the afternoon concert was just friends deliberately cheering her on.</p>
<p>Carver later said, "There is some difference in class between the two of you. She condescended to you. Actually, she is a social woman. Now she is going to take music as her career. This makes you very frightened. You don't want her to be like that, do you?"</p>
<p>Leonar wanted to shake his head bitterly.</p>
<p>"But she just won't let go," she said, looking at her watch and standing up. "I'm going to prepare for my own concert--I'm going to sing at the American Volunteer Army Conference tonight." As she shook Leonar's hand, she approached him and raised her head to look at his face. This powerful suggestion was very obvious.</p>
<p>'Can I kiss her?' Leonar thought to himself. "She is so lovely," at this moment, the bell rang suddenly.</p>
<p>A little promoter came in with a letter. When Miss Carver read it, she looked displeased. "Alas, they specifically want me to sing a military song tonight. I can't remember the words in the song. Now I have no way of knowing--a friend has left the city. This song is sung by their navy--about a destroyer."</p>
<p>Leona said, "Ah, that's the song!"</p>
<p>"Do you know it?" Miss Carver asked with excitement.</p>
<p>"Of course, I was a sailor in the Great War."</p>
<p>Miss Carver walked to the piano and played a note. Leona sang along, "Let me sing it to you." So he started to sing. But he stopped after not even singing a line. "Wait, I can't sing it like this, I can only sing it hiding in the bathroom. Where is the bathroom?" Carver pointed it out to him, watching him curiously. But he walked in. She followed to the door. He took a deep breath and started singing loudly.</p>
<p>Before he could finish a line, a cup on the washbasin shelf fell and shattered. He stopped singing and apologized anxiously, "Alas, I'm really sorry! I always have this kind of thing happen." As he said this, he picked up the fragments from the ground.</p>
<p>Miss Carver asked, "You said this has happened before?"</p>
<p>"It's happened twice."</p>
<p>She seemed to be dreaming as she walked to the piano and played a note, saying, "Sing, sing loudly."</p>
<p>"Okay, but if the mirror falls down too, don't blame me." So he started singing again. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Grass Court Tennis Singles Final Xu Weipei Wins the Championship Defeats Younger Brother Weipei Three to Two Little Xu Performs Very Well But Ultimately Loses Due to Inferior Skill</h3>
<p>…The All-Hong Kong Open Grass Court Tennis Singles Final was held yesterday afternoon at 4:45 at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. It was a competition between the Xu brothers, so whoever won or lost didn't seem to matter much. In short, the brothers monopolized the top two spots.</p>
<p>…During the battle, Little Xu worked very hard, refusing to be careless, and boldly attacked his brother's weaknesses, with the ambition to win the championship. The general audience was surprised and only then realized that the outcome of the Xu brothers' match was not predetermined.</p>
<p>…Among the guests were Governor of Hong Kong Sir Geoffrey Northcote, Deputy Judge John Lothian McDougal, Chinese representative Lo Man-Kam, and Chow Shou-son, which invisibly increased the competitors' enthusiasm.</p>
<p>…In the course of this competition, Xu Weipei encountered strong opponents one after another and faced many difficulties. Only because of his superior skills did he defeat the Lin brothers and reach the final. His personal technique is indeed very strong.</p>
<p>Xu Runpei encountered mostly unknown players in another group of competitions, so his highest level was not performed. It was not until yesterday that he tried his best to show it, with forehand, backhand, and net skills all in place. At the same time, he used dangerous angles to deal with his brother, winning the first set. The second and third sets were caught up by his elder brother, losing one to two instead.</p>
<p>In the fourth set, Da Xu wasted a lot of opportunities, hitting the ball over the net, and committing many double faults, resulting in two to two, three to three, and four to four, three draws. Afterwards, Little Xu's net performance was poor, and one smash and one kill often hit the vital points, winning another set with six to four, resulting in a tie of two to two.</p>
<p>In the final decisive fifth set, Da Xu worked harder and completed it in one go, taking the lead with an absolute advantage of five to one. However, Little Xu fought bravely and chased to four to five. At this time, the situation became tense again. Da Xu had to be careful and fought several times with fierce smashes at the net, achieving his goals and finally winning with six to four. The overall result was three to two, and he won the championship for two consecutive years.</p>
<p>Looking at the two's tennis skills, Da Xu is better and has better experience. He only performed seven-tenths of his full strength in this match, so good angles with the sideline and baseline were rarely seen. Net play was also only tried once or twice.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Sha Ba Dian, 8th] Yesterday, the Polish players defeated the Dutch players. After Poland won two consecutive singles, they won by four to one, entering the second week of the competition and meeting Germany. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chai Ge Dang Bo Dian, 8th] Yesterday, South players Medk and Pansik won straight sets over the Irish players Nanchen and Yizhen, so South won with a score of three-zero, and entered the second week of the competition.</p>

In yesterday's singles, Hungarian player Gaboldi lost to Romanian player Galaru by six to three, six to eight, four to six, and two to six, but Yasbo (Hungary) fought hard in five sets, defeating Smith (Romania) with one to six, six to two, six to three, six to eight, and six to two, and Hungary was able to enter the second week to battle Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of the two Xus is serving "double faults". Da Xu had a total of nine times and Little Xu had a total of eight times. If they encounter equally matched opponents, they will lose points because of it, which is very important. At the same time, the serves of the two Xus are also very loose. It is not easy to restrain strong players, and it cannot assist net play. Please pay attention to this. The results are listed below:</p>
<p>Xu Dengpei</p>
<p>Three to six</p>
<p>Six to two</p>
<p>Seven to five</p>
<p>Four to three</p>
<p>Six to four</p>

<h3>Public Basketball Game: Star Island Defeats South China, Championship Seemingly in the Bag; Minor Error Occurs During Game, South China Will Appeal; Eastern Strength Crushes Chung Sing, Then Voluntarily Withdraws</h3>
<p>(Our Special Correspondent) Last night, two very important Senior Group basketball games were held in the YMCA gymnasium. One was Peninsula versus South China, and the other was Chung Sing versus Eastern. These four strong teams coincidentally competed on the same evening, which was particularly noteworthy. Even with higher ticket prices, the venue was packed.</p>
<p>The Group B game started at 6:30 PM, with Wah Hung facing Chung Sing. Because their strengths were closely matched, the game was quite exciting. However, Wah Hung had more offensive opportunities and ultimately won 34-30.</p>
<p>The next game was the most crucial one concerning the championship. Most of the spectators showed sympathy towards South China, hoping for their victory. However, South China was defeated by Star Island with a narrow score of 29-31, by just one point. With this victory, Star Island sees the championship as practically guaranteed.</p>
<p>During the competition, both sides emphasized teamwork and cleverly utilized their skills to score points, resulting in a very balanced game. The score often fluctuated, with the difference between the two sides rarely exceeding one to three points, which illustrates the tension of the game.</p>
<p>Each side, upon gaining possession of the ball, seized the opportunity to advance and score. The only important condition of this strategy was gaining possession. Having the ball meant having a way out, so direct physical contact was rarely seen. Collisions were only necessary when fighting for the ball under the basket, to see who would win that crucial move.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire game, South China had slightly more opportunities to shoot than Star Island, but their angled shots from the left and right often missed the mark. They also had more free throw opportunities, but many of these were also missed. If their free throws had been more accurate, victory might not have been snatched away by Star Island. In my opinion, South China's defeat was not due to inferior technique, but primarily due to the squandering of free throw opportunities. Furthermore, the abnormal performance of Shek Chun-chi (石振智) was also a reason for their failure.</p>
<p>South China's players also lost many jump balls to Star Island. Another point was the lack of effective rebounding. Whenever their offensive shots hit the backboard, there were rarely any of their own players advancing to the basket to seize the opportunity. Consequently, when the ball bounced off, it was often snatched by Star Island's defenders. Conversely, Star Island did not have this problem, so their battles under the basket were often fruitful.</p>
<p>Star Island's performance was not as brilliant as when they played against Eastern. This was due to South China's excellent strategies, which effectively controlled their opponents. However, although South China managed to control the game, they still missed critical opportunities and suffered defeat, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>During the game, there was an incident where Star Island scored a basket, but before the shot was taken, the scorer's table suddenly blew the whistle. However, the referee did not follow by blowing the whistle to stop the game, and Star Island managed to score during this time. As it happened, Star Island won by only one point, with a score of 31-29. Consequently, South China raised questions after the game, arguing that the referee's failure to blow the whistle to stop the game at the time was improper, and they have announced their intention to appeal. So, what will happen next? Let's wait for the next installment.</p>
<p>In the final game, Eastern faced Chung Sing. Insiders believed that there would be a fierce battle, but Chung Sing's players performed poorly, resulting in a one-sided game. Chan Yu-chi (陳汝止) tried hard to fight back, but he was marked tightly by Eastern's Chan So-ki (陳索祺) and could not perform to his full potential. Kwok Chik-hung (郭植鴻) also failed to live up to expectations.</p>
<p>Eastern had Wong Ting-fan (黃鼎芬) and Sun Bo-hing (孫寶慶) off the court, but Fung Nim-wah (馮念華), Tsui Hang (徐亨), and Law Kat-on (羅吉安) and others performed exceptionally well, often charging into the opponents’ basket, which Chung Sing could not resist. Their teamwork was also well-coordinated. Consequently, Eastern was leading 36-16 by halftime.</p>
<p>In the second half, Chung Sing showed more spirit, with a momentum of overwhelming force. They launched a series of aggressive attacks and regained many points, rising rapidly. Eastern also retaliated with several scores during counter-attacks, leading to a fierce and tragic battle. During a scramble for the ball, Wan Fan (桓芬) and Shui Hing (瑞慶) collided with each other. As a result, Wan Fan's head was injured and bleeding, while Shui Hing lost consciousness for a while before recovering. Later, with five minutes remaining before the end of the game, Eastern was still leading 53-42, but Eastern suddenly declared their withdrawal to the referee, allowing Chung Sing to win. The scores of the Star Island versus South China game are listed below: (Tai Sui)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Soccer Team Returns in Defeat, Expected to Arrive This Morning</h3>
<p>— (Our Special Correspondent)</p>
<p>The Hong Kong interport soccer team departed for the Philippines on the 28th of last month with great fanfare. We all believed that this strong force would surely bring good news, and that they would have a successful trip, which seemed like a foregone conclusion. Furthermore, considering that the Philippine team was defeated three times in three matches when they came to Hong Kong in early spring, and that their technical level was lower than that of Hong Kong, which was evident to everyone, we believed that the Hong Kong team's trip to the Philippines would not be a problem for victory.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that the Hong Kong team's expedition would be unfavorable, suffering unexpected defeats one after another? In the first match, the official game against the Philippine interport team, and in the second match, the exhibition game against La Salle University, they both lost 1-3. The reasons for the defeats have been described in previous reports, related to timing, location, and personnel, which is the disadvantage of being the visiting team. Fortunately, they defeated the YCO team 4-1 in the third match, preventing a complete whitewash and regaining some honor.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team left the Philippines yesterday and is returning north on the Tai Ping steamer. It is estimated that they will arrive at around 10:30 AM today. The Football Association will send a small team to welcome them.</p>
<p>Hong Kong soccer has long been dominant in the Far East, but in recent years, teams in Southeast Asia have made significant progress, almost surpassing Hong Kong. Therefore, Hong Kong's soccer community should not be overconfident. If they want to maintain their superior position, they must make even greater efforts in the future. (Tai Sui)</p>
<h3>School Volleyball: Yesterday Senior Pui Ying Defeats King's College; Today Each Grade Has Three Matches</h3>
<p>The school volleyball competition, organized by the Volleyball Association, featured a match between Senior Pui Ying and King's College at 4:30 PM yesterday. Both sides showed great intensity, with King's College initially displaying strong momentum and putting immense pressure on Pui Ying. However, Pui Ying rallied and launched a counter-offensive. King's College's stamina waned, and their formation showed repeated weaknesses. Coupled with frequent misunderstandings in their middle and back rows, Pui Ying capitalized on their aggressive attacks and won 3-2, with scores of 14-21, 21-13, 18-21, 21-16, 21-13.</p>
<p>In the Junior Grade match between Tak Ming and Wah Yan, Wah Yan displayed strong fighting spirit and defeated Tak Ming 2-0, with scores of 21-10 in the first set, 21-11 in the second set, and 21-8 in the third set.</p>
<p>In the Minor Grade match between Farmar and Paul, both sides played fiercely. Farmar was stronger than Paul and won 3-1, with scores of 23-21 in the first set, 19-21 in the second set, 21-19 in the third set, and 21-19 in the fourth set.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on May</h3>
<p>-- Qiu Xian</p>
<p>Pomegranate flowers are in bloom, it's May.</p>
<p>May, bloody May, a May of many hardships, deeply engraving a [symbol obscured] mark on us, sowing the seeds of struggle in our hearts!</p>
<p>May 3rd, May 4th, May 7th, May 9th, May 30th.</p>
<p>[Text obscured]! [Text obscured]!</p>
<p>[Text obscured], [Text obscured] humiliation</p>
<p>Year after year, we lived like animals, letting pain and hatred gnaw at our souls, until this day, when it erupted like a volcano.</p>
<p>For survival, for freedom, and even more for the justice of humanity, we stood up firmly, raised our fists of resistance, and answered blows with blows! Who said I was a docile lamb, who said the 'sleeping lion' would not rise up and roar!</p>
<p>The raging wind stirred up the roar of the wilderness, and the whole world shook. China was struggling.</p>
<p>Now it is May again, and fierce battles are unfolding across China. Countless fields and homes have been destroyed by artillery fire, and countless compatriots have died, displaced by the shelling. However, no one complained, no one was discouraged! Everyone, with wounded spirits, stood on the front lines of the war of resistance for the sake of the motherland.</p>
<p>Yes, for the sake of the motherland, we no longer hesitate or waver; although the flowers of freedom are beautiful,</p>
<p>May is no longer a month of humiliation, [text obscured], a May of battle, a glorious May!</p>
<p>As the month of battle arrives, let us sing aloud!</p>
<p>"[Text obscured], [text obscured], [text obscured]!"</p>
<h3>Mountain Flowers</h3>
<p>-- Ding Di</p>
<p>In the deep valley, many unnamed wildflowers bloom, red, the passionate color; radiating the light of life.</p>
<p>The valley, deep, secluded, desolate, rarely visited by people.</p>
<p>It is locked in a long period of time, peaceful, undisturbed. The sound of the tournament gongs, the leisure of the frog's croaking, the evening heat under the bean trellis, the call of hoeing, the cattle and sheep in the poor alleys, the New Year's drums; as such, the flowering months and years pass, the wildflowers in the valley, watching us, silently, record them for us.</p>
<p>Flowers bloom and wither again, flowing through the years of spring and autumn in the valley. The mountain flowers are joyful.</p>
<p>Breaking through the quiet atmosphere, unaware of the years of the wilderness dream. A great upheaval occurs between man and beast. To resist the invasion of the beasts, man fights with the beasts. For this struggle, many warriors shed their bright red blood, damaging their limbs, or sacrificing their entire lives. The blood of the warriors flowed down, and the mountain flowers were dyed red.</p>
<p>The white bones and green phosphorescence are buried in the ground, the sounds of horse-riding at dusk. The wind and clouds of the desert, the ancient fortresses, when the fragrant grasses grow, you can't find any basis for missing them. But we can pick up one or two red mountain flowers in the valley, on the battlefield, at will. The equality of life, the light throwing of heads, allows you to understand the immortality of the stars, the longevity of the sun and moon. The soul comes to the maple forest green, the soul returns to the mountains black, the spark of life, does not disappear, nor does it blur. Unfolding the laughter of freedom, warming this merciless valley, so that we never forget that blood has flowed on this earth: passionate red, heroic red, brilliant red, giving us courage, comfort, encouragement, and impetus.</p>
<p>The stench fills the valley. Life is suffocating.</p>
<p>Only the mountain flowers, still standing upright in the ugly valley, in the dense thickets of thorns.</p>
<p>The wind is very foul, indicating the rampant nature of the beasts. The warriors shed their blood, cleverly mixing it into a kind of irrigation, cultivating the flowers of freedom, and dyeing them red.</p>
<p>In the struggle between man and beast, many warriors love to plant their flowers, scattering new seeds, year after year, the mountains bloom in clusters, not only in the valley, but also down to the low plains and lowlands. The dawn and the morning breeze, blowing open the stench and decay of heaven and earth. Each flower unfolds the wings of freedom.</p>
<p>There is no more stench. Revealing the freshness of the mountain flowers, a clear light and auspicious air in the universe.</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands of years of vicissitudes have been exchanged for the spring breeze of flowers, a spring rain came to the small building overnight, and tomorrow I will hear the sound of apricot flowers being sold, and maybe the sea will dry up, and the rocks will rot, but the mountain flowers will still remain: not withered, not yellow, and not decayed. It is not a fluke accident. You say, this mountain flower, no, you should say the soul of the warrior, the enlightener of freedom, this is not like those ordinary flowers!</p>
<p>The remaining dogs and sheep are finished. Giving us the enjoyment of happiness, wherever there are mountain flowers, freedom has germinated.</p>
<p>Freedom has germinated, which is truly a blessing for us, but we must not forget the hard-working and haggard gardeners!</p>
<p>We should thank them for the cultivation of blood!</p>
<h3>Criminal Morbidity of the Japanese Economy</h3>
<p>-- Yuan</p>
<p>Collapse is the result of disease. When the disease is in the internal organs, it is invisible to the eyes of ordinary people. However, as the disease deepens, the morbidity gradually manifests. We expected that Japan's main purpose, the war against China, would be a 'quick victory'. If it lasts for a long time, there will be the disaster of economic collapse. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, it has been nearly two years. What is the state of the Japanese economy? According to Japanese newspaper reports, the Minister of Finance said that of the 8.1 billion public bonds recently raised, only 5 billion can be offset by taxes, and the rest must be used by the Japanese people's savings. That savings is the national blood. Taking the national blood and turning it into glory bombs is the last resort, and economic collapse is not far away.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been a year since Japan implemented economic control regulations. Their people's understanding is not deep, so the number of violations is increasing. According to the investigation by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of its Ministry of Justice, from June of last year to February of this year, there were 13,581 violators nationwide. Among those prosecuted, there were 579 in Tokyo and 510 in Osaka. In addition, there are 3,150 people. Recently, the number of repeat offenders has been gradually increasing. The authorities of the Ministry of Justice believe that this is due to the previous lenient attitude and that the method should be changed, and that strict training should be adopted for violators. A few days ago, Matsumoto, the director of the Criminal Affairs Bureau, issued instructions to the national prosecutor's offices, saying that when dealing with such cases in the future, they should consider the circumstances of the case and impose physical punishment and fines, but with fines as the main punishment. Any law, if too many people violate it, its effectiveness will be equal to zero. When will the Japanese economy collapse? Judging from the above situation, I am afraid it is not far away!</p>
<p>Moreover, the Japanese in China take advantage of their power to make national disaster fortunes, which is not uncommon. Some use the military's passports to transport goods, or collude with unscrupulous merchants to engage in unclear and ambiguous businesses. These degenerate phenomena were not seen or heard in Japan before. Now this kind of fact is not only heard but also seen. The degeneration of the Japanese national character and the collapse of the country's social public economy can be seen from the morbidity of this national character.</p>
<h3>Spirit and Matter</h3>
<p>— Chì Qiáng</p>
<p>From a long time ago, the West talked about matter, while China in the East talked about spirit.</p>
<p>After the Reform Movement of 1898 failed, the Westernization movement rose, and the court and common people alike clamored for "foreign affairs, foreign affairs." The clamor filled the ears. Although the Reformist and Conservative factions each had their own reasons, the abandonment of spirit in favor of matter was, to some extent, an odd trend.</p>
<p>History always possesses the conditions of cause and effect. An event cannot be extracted one-sidedly to provide a simple answer; it's as difficult as trying to cut water with a knife.</p>
<p>For decades, the winds and rains of Europe and America have influenced the Chinese, who now wear long robes with Western trousers...</p>
<p>Forget it! You come!</p>
<p>A fearsome face of a Fascist dictator, a cannon, a row of machine guns - what is revealed is still not poisonous enough! Killing without batting an eye, of course, with airplanes and bombs above, and armored vehicles and tanks below. Matter, matter! Killing requires tightening one's own trouser belt. A slice of bread is approved by the central government, and orders are issued that you can't take an extra bite. White bread (塌) shouldn't even be thought of, distribution is revised several times, but the result is still just a waste of paper.</p>
<p>China has its own history, which is good in itself. However, the disastrous Qing dynasty suppressed morale horizontally and vertically, devising all sorts of methods to crush it. This left the whole country lifeless, believing that the emperor's eternal cause was finally settled. However, the imperial guards were useless, and the magic of the Boxers remained above the Ninth Heaven, unwilling to descend for a time. Thus, they opened the door to welcome reform and invited Mr. Matter to help. After matter caused a disturbance, the spirit became even more troubled, right up to the present. The spirit is unmoored, fishing up some superficial material, so that "the human body becomes a dead thing," and "scholars lose their lives in many ways, and the great path is lost like a stray sheep in a branching road."</p>
<p>Now, old debts are completely written off, and military service newly awakens the spirit! The great sword can be held upside down and handed over to others, but Mauser guns are also unreliable, because they can be used to fight the enemy but also to protect them. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen, when discussing the use of weapons, believed that it all depended on the human spirit, and once said, "Comparing the two, the power of spirit is nine, and the power of matter is one." The use of matter requires "authority"!</p>
<p>Facts tell people that those currently in certain positions are mostly in their fifties or sixties, judging by their age. Why are there so many people in their fifties and sixties? Were they born with such treacherous intentions? This is due to the lingering poison of the Qing dynasty's suppression of morale. In their youth, they were "dead things." They fundamentally lacked spirit. Therefore, Gu Xuan's advocacy of "anyone over forty should be shot" has a reason, it's not just nonsense.</p>
<p>Based on this judgment, we can raise a glass and dance for joy, saying, "The elimination of certain figures is a matter of time. They have declared their own death sentence in spirit, not worth even a press."</p>
<p>Due to the gravity of the times, we must send away the useless and welcome in new spirits. The so-called new spirit is the spirit that is indispensable at this time and in this place and that humans require for survival. Spirit is morale, is vigor, is vitality, is an invisible force. Therefore:</p>
<p>Our spirit must keep pace with the wartime effort, achieving genuine progress: the shortcomings of the past in spirit must be cleansed in the War of Resistance: those with duties must fulfill them: those with abilities must exert them: life must be serious and tense: the front and the rear must truly achieve shared hatred for the enemy and shared destiny, words and actions must be consistent, and gather under the goals of "nation above all, race above all, military first, victory first"; unwavering, not cheating above or below, not being false, not taking advantage of the situation, and adapting general social life to wartime conditions.</p>
<p>If these can all be achieved, then one portion of matter can be used as ten portions of matter.</p>
<h3>Mountain City</h3>
<p>— Qiàn Fēi</p>
<p>A gray sky shrouds the gray city. Small snowflakes flutter down, lightly. The mountain peaks are covered in a layer of white mist. Today is market day, but the weather is so cold, I'm afraid it won't be lively, will it?</p>
<p>However, when we walk out onto the street and outside the city gate, the market is bustling with activity. A cacophony of sounds mingles with people's breaths. The wind blows, making people shiver. Their voices tremble along with the air they exhale.</p>
<p>Unloading the heavy burdens from the backs of pack horses, they carry the fruits of their labor into the city to sell: red rice, peas, sorghum. People taking advantage of the market weave through the crowds of sellers.</p>
<p>"The prices are high. The price of grain has risen." Everyone says this.</p>
<p>"Isn't it? Rice that used to cost eight old dollars per斗 is now selling for fourteen dollars." The egg seller chimes in.</p>
<p>Eggs have also risen in price: from two cents to forty cents.</p>
<p>Caulifower, hook vine, potatoes, are placed alongside; but they have all risen in price.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Too many people!" The grain seller says. Because of the war, many people from the South have fled to this corner of the Southwest. Especially with the arrival of National Central University, the small county town has seen its population increase by a tenth out of nowhere, and everyone feels there are too many people. The poor wear strained expressions. They look at us with disgusted eyes. But there are also those who secretly rejoice, as goods are priced as high as possible, and their pockets fill up quickly.</p>
<p>The sun is still hiding in the clouds. A lead-gray sky covers the gray crowd -- huddling around a burning pile of dry grass and cow dung for warmth, eating red rice from bags. They rarely have cotton clothes to wear. But even if they did, their so-called cotton coats have already borne the weight of three generations of history. Broken, with patches of red and blue hanging down like beads, most of the cotton has already fallen out, with only a faint trace of cotton fluff hidden in the tattered cloth full of holes. The entire cotton coat is held together by just a belt. Everyone sighs and shivers, saying:</p>
<p>"Freezing!" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shū Qún</p>
<p>"Since I have already promised you that even if he doesn't redeem you, we will definitely let you go home within a month. You can rest assured!"</p>
<p>"I'm not going home, I'm not going home!"</p>
<p>"It's even better if you don't go home, wouldn't I have one more comrade?"</p>
<p>"Are you not lying?"</p>
<p>"I told you, I don't lie."</p>
<p>And so, her once helpless soul had a new place to rely on. And so, she planned to stay in that temporary room for a long time; she gave each item in the room a suitable place -- for example, she put the vase near the bed, so she could conveniently see it before going to sleep. And so, she felt that each of her comrades was kinder than when she had arrived. She saw them as fellow residents, as her own older and younger brothers, she saw their pain as her own misfortune, she saw their intentions as her own hopes, she despised their lack of aesthetic sense, and began to automatically tidy up their messy rooms, and finally, she gathered the dirty clothes and socks they had thrown everywhere, wrapping them into a ball. To avoid the bad smell, she pinched her nose for a long time. This was work she had never done at home.</p>
<p>"Rest, look, you've dirtied your hands!"</p>
<p>Yǔ Wén tried to stop her. But she stubbornly retorted with a kind of childishness:</p>
<p>"You have to control everything, do I need you to control me?"</p>
<p>She continued until she was satisfied, and then stopped, panting, constantly patting her chest. Then, they all gathered around her, praising her. Some said:</p>
<p>"You really are our good sister!" Others said:</p>
<p>"You really are our good comrade!" (Sixty)</p>
