<h3>高等敎育改革問題</h3>
<p>— 莊澤宣</p>
<p>七八年前，鄙人曾發表「髙等敎育革命」意見，認爲今後的大學，應分爲三部分：（一）「繼續原有訓練」，（二）「養成整理內地的建設人才」，（三）「養成移民殖邊的專門人才」，自抗戰以來，鄙人認爲更有試行此種分化制度的必要，鄙人所以主張大學中，加多（三二）兩部工作，其理由可分理論與事實兩方面講、在理論方面，我認爲：（一）中國敎育必須中國民族有出路，方有出路，（二）中國民族的出路，在積極方面，目前有兩條大道：一，整理內地，以安定人民的生活，發現（固有）文化的優點二開發邊疆，以樹立舊文化的新生命；（三）中國民族出路，在消極方面，目前也須顧到兩點：一，力求時間精力，尤其是用欵的經濟，以撑支危局，二，鼓舞民族自信心自信力、以作起死囘生的心理基礎；（四）爲整理內地起見，我們最需要的是鄕村建設領袖人才的訓練，一般人則應受廣義的民衆教育，（五）爲開發邊彊起見，政府資本家必須與專家合作，應用科學知能，從實騐到推廣的去工作，推廣時，必須施移民以特殊訓練，（六）爲力求經濟起見，政府及社會領袖人物，必須提倡刻苦生活，及防止一切的浪費，一切敎育，均須在節儉上做功夫；（七）爲樹立民族自信心自信力起見，我們應隨時隨地宣揚中國民族固有美德，傳播歷史上偉大成就與人物，及提倡國貨等事。這些話，似乎在抗戰二十個月的今日，更覺切迫。從事實上來看，我們知道抗戰以前，高等敎育機關，想在整理內地方面下手的，有河南村治學院，山東鄉村建設硏究院，河北縣政建設硏究院，江蘇省立敎育學院，四川省立敎育學院，華北五大學在山東濟甯合設鄉政實習所等；想在開發邊疆方面下手的，有中央政治學校在邊疆各地設立的分校，鄙人視察陜甘靑敎育後，曾建議充實甘肅學院成爲研究邊疆文化，試騐邊疆敎育的中心，其實移民海外，亦爲此種工作之一重要部份，而爲國立旣南大學創立本意之一。</p>
<p>抗戰以後，因戰區的擴大，許多公私立大學，紛自沿海各省，遷往內地及邊遠省份，雖則也有一部分遺留在外人租借地的，可惜此種遷移及遺留，多屬臨時决定，絕少事前預計，以致有些省分，高等敎育機關林立，而且全無分工合作的計劃，至於需要高等敎育的地方，却又無此種機關，而且未有任何大學遷去，以致如浙江又有省立臨時大學的設立。以前注意整理內地工作的高教機關，不幸均在戰區內，以致大都被迫停止工作，僅剩江蘇省立敎育學院，已遷至廣西于，而五大學合辦的鄕政實習所，則遷至貴州定番，改稱鄕政學院。鄙人認爲此種機關，最好每省籌設一所一，或就己有的高敎機關改辦。當然整理內地的工作，必須由此種機關與當地政府密切合作，此種機關所需之敎授，應以社會科學各方面的專家爲主體，在第一年予學生以基本訓練後，應以內地急需的問題爲中心，而不以傳統的學系來分組訓練；訓練的對象，多側重於處事待人接物方面，「從做裏學，從做裏敎，師生共同解决，問題的探討，各地的經騐，應設法互相交換，以資參考。</p>
<p>以前注意邊疆開發的高敎機關，本屬犬少，而在抗戰以來，此種機關需要更迫，我認爲至少須在西北西南及沿海擇三四中心，集中人力與財力，設立三四所高敎機關，協助邊疆與海外事業的發展。在西北西南方面，應以自然科學的應用爲課程主體，在第一年予學生以基本訓練後，就墾殖，水利，交通，重工業，輕工業，冶鑛，醫藥衞生等部門，分組訓練。社會科學方面，應注重漢族以外各民族文化的探討。沿海方面的，應以社會科學的應用爲課程主體，在第一年予學生以基本訓練後，就敎育，金融，工商企業二工廠經營，運輸等部門在海外之發展爲訓練對象，而以海外各地文化之研究爲共同必修科。移民工作，本非易事，應先作小規模的試殖，逐漸擴大，所遇問題，由師生與移民共同研究解决途徑。</p>
<p>從戰區移出，或原在非戰區，比較未受大損失的髙敎機關，仍宜繼續原有工作，養成各學術與專門人才，如何分工合作，以冀用欵省而收效大，也值得通盤籌劃。如此整個重新支配，或原有的敎授太多，應由政府資助赴海外講學或服務。據鄙人所知，海外僑胞，極願担任一部分旅費，歡迎熟習祖國靑况的學者前往作有系統的學術演講，同時或可帮助研究海外事業的發展方法，中央不妨仿照中小學敎師服務團，組織大學敎授服務圑，至海外服務，凡比種種，如能辦到，不獨有助於目前之抗戰工作，且有利於將來的民族復興。</p>
<h3>世界動向一周間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從三月廿六日至四月一日</p>
<p>震慄人心的三月，在極度緊張，嚴重，危急中過去了。侵略者，被侵略者，誰都希望乘此透一口氣，休息休息吧？然而，嚴重的問題，還緊緊地追迫着；首先民主和平各國的團結運動，已經稍有頭緒了，但是還不够堅強，還不足予侵略者以致命的打擊。其次一，侵略國家，德國在東歐東北歐，意大利在西班牙，以至日本在南昌，都巳有所收獲了，而且也都筋疲力盡了，也想休息一下了；然而蘇聯的和平政策獲得極大成功，民主和平陣綫更加鞏固與擴大，反之侵略陣營內部的矛盾却到了無法掩飾的地步，他們又不能不繼續採取攻勢！最後，說到我們中國，內外形勢都已益趨好轉，贛江和西江的戰事亦巳轉危爲安，然而日×的陰謀層出不窮，漢奸的活動亦變本加厲，我們的進步還很不够，民族的危機還極嚴重，這是需要我們每個不願意做奴隸的人引以警惕，引以自勉的。</p>
<p>民主和平陣線強化</p>
<p>在法西斯侵略國家德意日加緊挑戰的威脅之下，在社會主義國家蘇聯大聲疾呼忠言艱險之下，在各國廣大勞苦累素與和平正義人士的艱苦鬥爭之下，英法美等民主和平的國家，終於開始進一步的採取團結合作的辦法了。這一週來，民主和平陣綫鞏面與擴大的情形越發明朗，特別重要的是英蘇談判的進步。英海外貿易大臣赫德森於三月廿四日與蘇對外貿易委員長米髙陽首次暢談四小時，赫談『經過和治，並具有政治的重要性』。廿五日英國親德派報紙，親察報』傳說『蘇聯提請英蘇必須採取聯合軍事行動』，廿七日香港『士蔑四報』則稱英蘇軍事合作，蘇方建議突在作戰時可自由使用海參威及堪察加兩地，英方則取道加拿大以援蘇，廿七日莫斯科公佈『英蘇商約談判已建立基礎，將續在倫教舉行。至於國際問題，交換意見結果，且已建立個人間的接觸，以謀國際事件上互相合作』英蘇友好合作關係的成立，不僅如法國政界意見：『足以維持歐洲和平』實足以助益於世界和平。這是鞏固與擴大民主和平連綫的基幹，英蘇談判順利，接着是英波談判的成功，波蘭一面宣佈决不容許對德屈服，一面加緊整軍備戰，而英首相張伯倫亦於卅一日在衆院聲明『英决援助波蘭，協力抵抗任何侵略』了！緊跟著英法合作亦更密切！現在兩國積極進行軍事同盟談判，英軍事代表圑已抵法，法航空部長賴尙伯亦將赴英，法國總理逵拉第廿九日演說，就已斷然拒絕意大利的要求。至於兩國合發反侵略宣言，更加不生問題了。最後英美關係，雖無重大進步，但觀於英王訪美程序的决定，英美對德經濟制裁的醞釀，可見形勢尙可樂觀。美國方面，則一面埋頭從事戰備，一面將中立法討論暫時擱置，明自表示援助民主國家。所有這些事實，都擴大了。不過我們同時要知道，英法政策的轉變，還不够堅持與澈底，甚至還有對侵略者虛聲威嚇與用進步政策以緩和國內反對怒潮的用意。不久法國總統將改選，英內閣改組計劃亦由艾登等提出，我們目前就要加緊統一與發展英法各國人民反法西反侵略運動，促成集體安全制度，進一步保證民主和平陣線的勝利，才能澈底掃蕩大戰的暗靈。</p>
<p>侵略集團裂痕暴露</p>
<p>蘇聯和平政策的新成功，民主和平陣線鞏固奧擴大的傾向，各國人足反法西斯反侵略怒潮的洶湧，已使法西斯侵略者開始驚慌！已使法西斯侵略集團裂痕暴露！首先引人注目的是德意矛盾的尖銳化：由於德國侵略利刃所向，竟巳威脅到意大利勢力範圍及侵略目標的匈牙利與南斯拉夫，以致引起意國的不安。而意大利發動匈牙利爭奪捷克小俄羅斯區，又遭德國指揮斯拉夫軍予以反擊，更引起意方的憤怒。不意接着又有德國獲取南斯拉夫市場計劃的暴露，使意大利越發感到德國的威脅，而不能不謀求對策。『德意軸心』裂痕暴露的消息就此傳了出來。其次是德日矛盾的尖銳化。州一日美聯社上海電稱：日德關係近有破裂之勢，原因是：（一）中國最近與德國訂立價值一千萬元的物物交換商約，（二）日本不敢參加反共軸心之軍事同盟，（三）中國近日突從德國輸入巨量貨物及軍火。使日本侵略者談爲熏方破壞反共協定精神。</p>
<p>本來，侵略國的陣綫，是利害的勾結，「反共」是這種×××結的一種掩飾，侵略勞力的發展，他們相互間的矛盾亦必隨着發展，最後火拚，是必然的結局。而且，意德勾結，實際上祗是意國經墨索里尼領導着替希特勒還征軍搖旗吶喊，本身祗有忍辱，絕少利益。同樣日德勾結，日本固無法從德國取得任何實際上的帮助，德國亦有犧牲其原先在華權益的苦惱，這是侵略集圑先天的不足。分崩離折，並非奇事，亦屬必然。</p>
<p>不過如果我們在今天就斷言侵略集圑已經開始崩潰，那麼不僅是『尙非其時』，而且很有可能爲侵略者「見而獰笑』！先說意德關係，意國聯德誠是莫大損失，但墨索里尼侵略政策一日不破產，則意德軸心必仍一日存在。因爲墨索里尼要保障其在阿比西尼亞與西班牙的贓物，要「不做地中海的囚徒」而「建立大羅馬帝國」，都必須依賴德國帮助他打擊英法，才有實現這些企圖的可能。墨索里尼三月廿六日的演詞中，雖巳顯露對於德國態度焦慮，因而不得不極力運用「温和」的語氣，然而與具說他不惜放棄軸心，不如說他之急於要求德國的援助！戈林不久卽將往訪墨索里尼，我們看今後的事實吧！其次日德聯盟，確爲日本全全國多數人所反對，日德利害亦够術突之處。但是日本侵略者深知「遠交近攻」的妙處，並且沒有『反共』的旗幟，則對華作戰便喪失其藉口，軍心民心固不待說，便略營壘的丑態亦將全部暴露，而不免於總崩潰！所以我們說到這裏，就不得不注意：</p>
<p>日乂又有陰謀毒計</p>
<p>日×侵華軍事，時間越延長，前途越渺茫，而國內以至軍隊內的崩潰傾向越發展，這是日×當局所明繚的！因此他們一面企圖以戰鬥力的最高度的發揮，消滅中國抗戰主力，封鎖及截斷中國外援，以便迅速降服中國，迅速結束戰事。不這這種企圖因爲中國內外形勢的好轉而希望甚少，於是不能不隨時進行其『反共』『和平』『調解』等等誘降的毒計，雖有德大使陶德曼陰霧與在精衞××陰謀的慘遭失敗，但是日×仍是千方百計的求其實現，</p>
<p>最近英駐日駐華兩大使在滬會談，討論保護上海租界及己被日本破壞的英國在華政治經済利益等問題，二十九日美聯社重慶電稱兩大使還將討論目前中日形勢進行調解問題。日×便　乘機散佈其調解妥協的謠言；接着又有中德商務關係好轉，一千萬元商約成立的消息，廿九日美聯社上海電卽巳傳稱：「中德關係旣吿進步，則德國或將出任調人，調解中日戰事」。日×誘降毒計的演出，於是更加猖獗。四月一日報載，在精衛立卽發表一篇迎合日方意圖的文章，主張什麽「國際調停與直接交涉同時並進，如此則我以在野之身從旁協助」，日×窮極求和但仍力謀誘降的黑幕，已經有部份地揭露了！</p>
<p>本報昨日社評已經說得明自，日×漢奸這種醜行的總演出，其目的『正在削弱我政府在民衆中在國際上的威信，正在挑撥離間我國內　結與國際關係，正在破壞民主和平國家的合作』！日×的散佈謠言，暗施毒計，與漢奸曲意迎合，推波助瀾，只在破壞中國的抗日民族統一戰綫。只在停止中國全國的抗戰建國事業，最終目的就是實現誘降實現征服中國進而獨覇太平洋。</p>
<p>然而日×漢奸這種陰謀毒計，以致國際上任何排演新慕尼黑丑劇的企圖，都將最後粉碎在日益壯大的中國各黨派各階層各少數民族抗戰建國的統一戰綫之下！都將最後粉碎在具有唯一最髙領袖，具有革命政黨領導，具有廣大領土上生動力量，具有蘇聯英美與全世界勞動大衆正義人士之擁有的中國抗戰的偉大力量之下！卅一日美聯社上海電說得對：『中國國勢，不論政治外交財政經濟，均呈突飛猛晋，中國斷不肯中途　和！」中國人民今日，都要嚴密注視×好的陰謀，準備予以澈底的打擊，主要的是要推進政治上更大的進步：抗戰，民主與動員的連環的進步。</p>
<p>抗日戰爭一周情勢</p>
<p>也許有人說，日×漢奸最近再度發動『反共』『和平』『妥協』『調解』等等誘降的陰謀毒計，原因在於中國最近軍事上的失利。事實上，這一週間戰鬥的結果，中國東南僅存的大都市南昌也失陷了，粵南的江門也有兩度失陷的消息。中國是受到相當的損失的。但是我們就不看日本的損失嗎？我們就不看看全部的戰局嗎？我們就武斷地說『中國失敗』『日本又勝了』嗎？不，這是大的錯誤，也是絕大的罪惡！</p>
<p>日×攻奪南昌，是有整個計劃的，我們早在數星期前巳經　重指出，不過我們同時要明白：（一）就日×攻摩南編的目的說，還是消極的，一面企圖振作其日趨疲亂的士氣，另一面企圖截斷浙贛路，威脅粵漢路，以加强其華果占領區的統治，揮利對游擊隊的進攻；（二）就×人攻奪南昌的戰略說，一面因其目的的消極性，而仍處於被動形勢，他不能也不敢擊破我的主力；另一面他被逼只能爭城市爭交通綫，翼後翼側到處留下空際，聯系接濟全不相應，所以×波修水而我廬山區擊游隊已斷其後路，×渡贛江，而安義奉新等地相繼收復；（三）就南昌陷落的利害說，南昌是浙贛路的突出點，處戰略上不利形勢，今我退出南昌，待機　×，至出今×猶未敢南下。而贛浙路則仍於南昌以南作直綫的接軌，實際上未被截斷。反之×佔南昌，遭我留城精銳作街屋抗戰，損失重大，而進攻南昌的四師團×兵，經過旬日間激戰，傷亡一萬五千。（卅日美聯社上海電則稱過去一週×在贛北死傷三萬名）武寗一綫戰事，　×亦四千人！（四）我們在這場戰役中，證明了運動戰略的成功，實現了空陸兩軍的密切配合，完成了大量殲滅×軍主力的計劃。現在我贛鄂湘邊贛北廬山及皖南各地先後發動反攻，華中×軍主力將受更大的懲創，可無疑問。</p>
<p>其次，華南戰事亦呈緊張，×軍連下容奇桂州，兩度衝進江門，中山石岐；爲之震動，×軍聲勢，似亦大足懾人，但從戰略上觀察，×軍此次作戰亦是消極性的，企圍鞏固其在廣州的佔領，以便積極發展其『掃蕩』游擊隊的戰事，鞏固其未來線攻西南時的後方，其用作和攻奪南昌略同。現在我大軍增援，形勢巳較平靜。不過××對西南攻略，實較華中方面更加重視。他們今後還會企圖利用進攻江門等戰役，吸引　打擊我主力，進而取道北海，猛犯南路，窺伺南寧，同時輔以西北兩綫之×，作分犯梧州桂林之勢，以分散我兵力。×人久認西南爲我抗戰主要根據，且爲主要國際通路所在，加　國際背景較西北易於應付，×方海陸空軍聯糸亦較容易，行軍距離又較短少，而漢好親日份子則加緊活動，這是我們必須加意警防的。</p>
<p>最後華東華北戰局，近來仍無重大變化。東雨各地因×犯南昌的刺激，大規模的游擊戰巳在積極準備。華北方面，朱德將軍已于廿七日就任某戰區副長官的兼職，廿九日通雷盡力鞏固×後抗日根據堆，××日本×國主義，爲建立三民主義新中國而奮鬥到底。同時晋南大捷的電報，亦跟着發現於昨日本港各報。日方盛傳我軍將大舉反攻華北。這雖出自日方報紙，但發展×後游擊戰爭，確是我們當前『制止×之進攻爭取最後勝利』的最重大最緊急的任務，我們期待着史多更大的勝利。</p>

<p>【上海通信】本市外訊、中國華洋義振會救災總會總幹事貝克博士、赴華北視察、歷時三週後、二十日返滬、語記者云、本年度華北之水災情况、雖不若往年之嚴重、惟該地大部份人民、仍須加以救濟、冬收雖豐、惟農民之收入减少、因棉花唯有日軍購買、而日軍所付者、僅及棉價三分之一也、目下華北日軍與土匪、遍佈各地、故救濟農民、實爲艱難之任務、凡携欵入鄉者、已不復安全、貴重物件、幾必遭土匪洗刦、各小縣中商業不振、亦使是項任務艱難之一因、旣不能携款人各縣、或因此等區域內缺少銀行利便、故匯款、屬不能、貝克博士又稱、渠在華北時、日人實行新貨幣方法　其目的在危害中國法幣之價值、惟此舉實行至今　已經慘敗、非特未能杜絕法幣之流通、且助使業已升水之法幣、升水益髙、此日方主持之辦法、志在禁止民衆流通法幣。名義上凡被抄出携有一角法幣一紙者、處創一萬元、但若其人身　「聯鈔」被游擊隊抄出，則將被處死刑、外商營業、確在停頓中、外人今已明瞭一切商業、卒將遭日人悉數統制，今外商芷待發展中，關於日人之壟斷羊毛一節，貝克博士相信此舉必難收效、織造毛毯之商店今已不能在市場上購得羊毛、交通方法。邇來已稍轉佳、惟火車僅行駛畫間、入夜仍吿停駛、游擊隊襲擊車站事、仍有發生、鐵這一帶，可見強固之堡壘、沿運輸綫各衝要地點、今由日軍與紅槍會中人防守之、貝克博士復批評民氣云、臉現笑容者、殊少見之、亦未見一人跨馬游於街頭、此可表示彼等並未　然忘憂也、北平有許多房屋在與建中、大多爲日人所有，房租激增、惟薪給亦增、北平各街、常有軍用卡車成列、疾馳而過、致交通擠擁不堪、日本藝妓若干、今居北平、日人商、亦在激增中、</p>
<h3>一年來榆林文化顧回與前瞻</h3>
<p>（讀昨）</p>
<p>新聞記者學會公推黎聖倫君（掃蕩報特派記者）爲籌備處主任委員，內設戰時作業部，戰時工作部之下，又分通訊，服務，編輯三組。</p>
<p>西北戰地文化工作圑，這完全是一個戰地服務的團體，他的組織是這樣：</p>
<p>總務組。</p>
<p>西北戰地文化工作團一出版組——戰報，叢書，漫畫。</p>
<p>戰工組——前方演劇，歌詠。</p>
<p>這個團體的工作正在開展中，他將要負祖着保衛大西北戰鬥中的艱巨的文化任務。</p>
<p>最後我們要談到熱愛祖國，而爲組國流血奮鬥的許多流亡靑年，他們由各地來到了陜北，配合警當地的靑年組織起了抗×寫傳隊，在二十一軍圑領導之下，從一九三八年三月起，展開了神聖偉大的工作。</p>
<p>這個抗×宣傅隊是由束大同學趴治國先生領導，他們編過了不少妁劇本，作爲鄉下宣傳的資料，通俗的小傅單，雄壯激昂的歌聲喚醒了千百萬羣衆，在耽球運動的熱潮中，曾製出了百多個靑年幹部，分散到各地的學校去，部隊起着推動作甩。通街大衛都張貼了新鮮的標語和漫畫，悲壯而沉着的歌聲充滿着古老的　林城，在許多廊會和例會中，都有着他們化　濱講的形影。這裏值得注意的，他們要成立了一個短期的日語訓練班，每個隊員都學會三二十句在火綫上對話的普通應用日語，他們更用隊員去進行羣衆和士兵的敎育都收到良好的效果。</p>
<p>府，保曾一度被日×侵入，抗救爲了服務當時受傷的官兵，他們便在楡林成立了一個傷兵慰勞隊，向楡林各機關懲求了很多的書報，有計劃的分送給傷兵去閱讀，并經常派工作人員寫家書，讀書報，唱歌，講故事，及縫洗衣服……他們安慰了傷兵，幷鼓勵着重上前線的勇氣。</p>
<p>由於抗宣隊的影響與鼓勵，啟發各學校自動的成立了一個暑期鄉村服務團，年靑健壯的髙初中男女學生，踴躍的參加，充實了這個團體，很快的出發到鄉村到前綫，和士兵農民一起生活着，他們克盡了宣傳組織責任，給軍民合作盡了極大的推動作用。</p>
<p>緊接着農村服務度而起的，使產生了一個前方戰地服務團，和三個畢校聯合組織的大時代劇圑，往後便是中學生的勵志社與縣部所領導的靑年抗×先鋒圑，也相繼組成起來，所有這些團體，都環纔着成千整萬的羣衆，都曾經盡了時代所給予他們的使命，實在是值得實許的。</p>
<p>這裏，我們要介給蒙占藝術宣傳隊了，他是由國內靑年藝術家張　陶今也　風等領導的，這是屬于綏蒙指導長官公署下面的一個對蒙古的宣傅機構，這些靑年都有着藝術與寫作的才幹，他們在此地會公演過無數次的劇，出版了蒙古宣傳畫輯，和蒙古歌集，無疑的，這都是推動蒙古工作更進一步的表現。</p>
<p>抗戰一年來的事烽火中，楡林文化工作者在塞上古城裏　使人與奮在熱，對國家對民族，盡了他應有的努力，但不可否認的，他做的柴度與廣度還是不夠。我們認爲；</p>
<p>（一）民衆運動在今天是應該配合抗戰形勢去積極的發動與前進，而且時時刻刻配合應着時代去服務于抗戰。</p>
<p>（二）文化運動主要是通過羣衆，敎育羣衆，提髙民衆的民族覺悟，使每個人都能走到抗日的最前線去，因而文化運動普遍深入到鄕村是必要的而且迫切的。</p>
<p>（三）文化工作者應該拿着他的尖銳的武器去對軍法西斯日本强盜用力刺去，發揮他應有的效果。</p>
<p>中華民族神　抗戰，巳經踏進更艱苦的第二個階段，保衞大西北已經成了四萬萬五千萬同胞每個人均艱苦任務，文化工作者是應該針對着自己的弱點去克服，而且客觀的情勢巳絕不允許他的弱點再存留下。、</p>
<p>因此對楡林文化工作者的前瞻，願寄語如下；</p>
<p>文化工作者是需要而且迫切　要求着他門在困難前面艱苦奮鬥，在戰爭烽火瘋燃塞上古城的狂潮中，負担起應且會負的任務，換句話說，前途是光明的！</p>

<h3>兩個不同的景象</h3>
<p>— 范世勤</p>
<p>鄂中戰斗前后</p>
<p>到了荆門一連下了四天的大雨，二十日天氣雖己放晴，可是公路上還是堆滿着泥漿，所以只得再苦挨一天。那天下午一時，來了空襲警報，當爬上城邊的山上的時候，便聽得「嗡嗡嗡」的聲昔，不至兩分鐘，就見九架發光的×機城空上穿過，大家以爲×機他去，情緒都恢復平常一樣，不料×幾突然掉轉頭來「嗡嗡嗡」擊音，益發響了。</p>
<p>「噓噓　」一陣怪叫，在天空中響了起來，這怪叫條是一羣惡鬼的在嚷，「碰碰碰——耳中還未聽得這巨聲的時候，就見城中從南到北冒出一座黑煙來，頓時滿城成了煙海。這時，幽美的荆鬥景色，已爲滿犬殺氣龍罩。</p>
<p>『嗡嗡　』的聲音益近，又是一陣『噓噓噓的怪叫，在頭上在耳邊響着很久似的，發出碰碰碰』的聲音來，城內又是冒出一陣黑烟，其中兩處發出紅的火光，這正像城市的鮮血噴出了。×機過後，山上山下一陣嘈雜，躲在山上的老百姓，雖然避去這個危險，可是各人組心着自已屋子的命運，都急忙的奔下山去。</p>
<p>五分鐘後，天空中又『嗡嗡嗡』的響着，立刻又有九架的×機從南飛來，一到城空，分為三隊，『噓噓噓』『碰碰碰』炸彈像雨一樣的密，一條一條黑色似的炸彈，從空中飛了下來，有的在半空中開了花，一團火光四飛着，有的仍在城裏爆裂，一團一團的火，依次起來，美國人創辦的一所學校，一個教堂，上面掛著美國旗，瓦上涂著鮮明的美國國微，亦難逃×彈的吞滅。</p>
<p>像是做了一場惡夢下了山，</p>
<p>××軍的一位副官，說是那晚該軍舉行軍民游藝大會，邀記者去參觀，在游藝大會上，聽到×總司令知道荆門被炸以後，散發災民一千元的救濟費的消息，非常興奮。這理我們不得不佩服荆門軍民的精神，雖然他們白天遭遇這樣奇重的轟炸，可是晚上他們舉行的遊藝會中的鑼鼓，比×人的炸彈還敲得響，軍民的擁擠，正像躱在防空壕中這不過氣來一樣。</p>
<p>八對士兵，喬扮八對奇裝的男女跳着舞，唱　　，燈光燭影伴着他們的舞步鑼鼓聲合着他們的歌音，記者自已幾乎疑心置身在銀幕上的一個盛大的夜舞會中。</p>
<p>最可玩味者，是一盞船燈本面有個船娘，外面有個船夫，船夫傘着一枝漿，船夫在外面怎麽划着，船娘在裏面怎麽　着，忽緩忽急忽進忽退，湊合得很自然。</p>
<p>一幕一幕的過去，大家歡呼着，大家髙笑着，掩去了白天的創痕。</p>
<p>走上鄂中前綫，正遇着最緊張的時候，二十八日那天，×總司令率領幾位重要的將領，親上前綫指揮戰事，記者適於途中遇及，忽談之餘，謹祝其再來一個「台兒莊」。</p>
<p>這次×在鄂中攻犯，是分着三路，不容說主力是在公路綫上（京鐘漢宜路）因爲×人主力離開公路綫，就不發生作用，而且有被我們消滅可能；—路是由京山北犯三陽店；一路是由天門南犯岳口。×人在三陽店攻擊的自的，是在吸引我們的主力，然後×人在京鍾路上拿出主攻的面目來，三陽店和京鐘路相距雖只有八十餘里，可是那裏都是髙山峻嶺，要是我們主力被×吸引到那方面去，無論如何，在一天中是趕不回來，我們知道×人的調計，始終沒有上了×人的當，岳口方面×人，爲着掩護其正面進攻起見，所以在二十七日把岳口侵佔了。</p>
<p>這次××集團軍的××××四位帥長，都是身先士卒，親臨火線，冒死指揮戰事，×人在哪中的十幾天戰事中，沒有一天不施用大量毒氣，我們士兵雖然犧性很大，可是×人的損失，遠過我們。</p>
<p>這裏應該提醒大家，這次鄂中戰事，雖然十分激烈，可是不是戰略上的攻擊而是戰術上的推動，×人如有戰略上的大企圖，必須在××方面故作聲勢。同時在××方面，故作疑陣，在前綫的×人僅僅一師團半，還都是原任那裏防守的部隊，在兵力上，×人也沒有重大企圖，听謂戰術上的推進，僅是企圖奪取九個前綫遽點而已。</p>
<p>×人這次在鄂中發動的戰術戰，不是無因，第一，因爲我們的游擊隊，在鄂中太活動，甚至有些潛入武漢附近，把×人所扮演的僞組織，常常摧毀，所以×人妄想開拓前綫地位，以掩護其後方作惡導演的醜劇。第二，因爲知道我們的部隊，日漸堅强，恐怕遭受嚴重打擊，所以作一個攻勢，以實行所謂「確保前綫佔領地位」的政策。第三，×人因爲在後要便利其與海洋聯合作戰起來，所以目前先奪取沿河沒江據點，俾在春暖水漲以後，大舉進兵。</p>
<p>×人於本月五日，侵據了　　，但這對我們影裔甚微，因爲鐘祥是在河東，原無險要可守，而且我們的正規軍游擊隊，仍在河東與×血戰，×人現在伸出鄂中的縱形戰綫二百餘里，我們的部隊，正在其用側翼，時時可以側擊，×人要向前展拓，必定會有慘敗的結果，而且××方面，我們有大兵團監視着，×車一定感覺前進後還都有困雞了。（中央社）</p>
<h3>廣東政治的新途徑　（五）</h3>
<p>— 李平</p>
<p>韶關特約通訊</p>
<p>（七）加强政治動員，避免强迫拉夫的動員；（八）要民衆不脫離生產的「自治』「自衛』『自給』打成一片，更要做到『人不離槍，槍不離鄕』；（九）不受武器限制，幷吸牧尙未報到的武裝份子，不特有槍的人要受訓練，沒有槍的也要訓練；（十）培養幹部吸收幹部和調整幹部，幹部决定一切；（十一）　淸妒徒與流民地痞分子；（十二）如能鞏固各職業團體的基礎，則自衛圑之充實與擴大，自然容易百倍；（十三）建立區模範自衛團，擴大動員與組訓的工作；（十四）財政公開。</p>
<p>四　怎樣整飭紀網與肅淸貪汚</p>
<p>（一）賞罰要嚴明，政令的推行如軍令，要　速確實；（二）實行民主集中制，每一個　政人員對于主管長官有權提出檢討，民　政治官吏的汚行，有　揭發；（三）財政公開改善目的經理制度，財政的收入和支出，不屬員有權過向，而且應該讓民衆知道，以杜抽　中飽；（四）以公　制度對付貪汚份子，使澄淸吏治通俗化，一次揭發，便有一次的敎育作用，同時公共制裁的偉大，可以使貪污歛跡；（五）應用與論制裁貪汚。（六）減　上級職員的薪偉，稱加上級職員的薪俸，提倡刻苦的美風，（七）保陣公務人員的職位；（八）檢査貪汚要從上級做起。（未完）</p>
<h3>從焦土中　復蘇的長沙</h3>
<p>— 長沙特約航訊　張常人約航訊</p>
<p>從衡陽到長沙的公路上，祗有很少的軍用汽車在活動。湘潭附近的渡口，長沙大火前孜，曾有六百輛以上的汽車在此擁待南渡，現在只有我們所乘的一輛駛上北岸。陌頭楊柳，村前桃花，與叱牛春耕的農夫相對若笑，湘東以及全國各地的人民，正以加緊生產來支持戰爭，答覆×人。</p>
<p>雖然修河贛江的大戰巳經揭開，湘鄂前綫却仍平靜無事。</p>
<p>三月的長沙，巳從焦土上復蘇過來。像韋爾瓶在「未來世界」中所描寫的第二次世界大戰後的歐洲城市一樣，刦後的人民正在廢墟中重建一切。可是畢竟沒有那麽寂寞，那麽凄凉，因爲偉大的中華民族，原是最經得起災難，最勇於創造的民族！</p>
<p>我曾眼見長沙的焚化，相隔不過四個月，又會見了它的新面目。我驚佩湘南人的勇氣，他們在距最前綫只有一百多公里的後方，加緊建設長沙。</p>
<p>擁有六萬餘幢房屋，數十萬人口的長沙，在大火之後，只在東南北三面零落地留下了一萬多幢和三萬多人口。現在，新的房屋不斷地在瓦礫中建立起來，人口已將十倍於當時，囘鄉的人還疋陸續於途。茅草和木板搭成的房屋只是其中的一小部分，講求門飾的市房也在逐漸增加。南疋路一帶，一個都會所應有的商店巳經全備——除了銀行和典當</p>
<p>金舖是可驚異的像烟紙店那麼多。論外表，還不及烟紙店那麽「富麗」，實際上，我以爲它却是長沙金融界的覇主，它代替了銀行和典當。許多人把金飾向它兌換現欵，許多房屋和商店都用這兌欵才一一的建立起來，社會是建立在經濟基礎上的，中央銀行長沙辦事處卽將在四月初成立，今後的長沙無疑將因金融的活動而更堅强和穩固起來。</p>
<p>原有的較大的旅館都燬滅了，代之以興的是四百衆以上的「大旅社」。最大的『三和』有三四十間房，普通是從五六個到十四五個房間。這些『大旅社』的主人，大多數是稍有　產的幸運的小　民，許多商店的店員現在要曲而快樂地執行『茶房』的任務，幾乎每一個人家就是一家商店，至少在門前擺一個攤子釆謀過活，樣子都很「過』得去。卽使是冉好的天氣，市民也想不到空襲這件事。日本軍閱指揮下的『飛賊』們的目標是集居的和平民衆，長沙這二十多萬疏開着的市民，難以滿足她們殺人的慾堅。</p>
<p>舊日的大商店以臨時商店的名義出賣存貨，這「臨時」的意思是指新　尙未落成的時期而言，新的商店常採用對前途樂觀的名目做店號，可窺見一般人民對抗戰前途的感想，但也不免有「動搖份子」，有一家飲食店取名「投機館」，我想它的主人一定預備隨時離開長沙。物價比衡陽髙，　不合理地抬髙的桂林却低得多。大部分日常甩品都來自温州，很少是國貨廠商的出品，許多牌子是陌生的，許多商標隱着「太陽」紅的意味。</p>
<p>電燈電話不久就可恢復，有使用電話必要的機關和住宅，都接有軍用電話，日報有國民日報（對開，，陣中日報（四開）人民日報（小型）等三種；及新市民晚報（八開）一種。最近各報舉行慰勞前方將士的義賣，有以三十元購報一份的讀者。</p>
<p>要沙的夜市雖比不得從前，都和白天的熙攘情形一樣。因爲電燈還在籌備，熱鬧的街道便由幾家商店合力維持一盞汽油路燈，每隔一二十家一盞，馬路上反較過去更明亮了。偏僻的街巷，由居民五家合置玻璃火油路燈一盞，雖然比絞暗一些，行人畢竟便利不少。有些窮苦的人，常在深夜去偷油，却並不偷燈，於是有些燈我發現有滑稽性的墨筆或白粉字句「如你又來了！」『你來偷燈油，當於你老婆。』之類。這些路燈的主人對所偷油人大都一笑了之，因爲一盞火油燈點到深夜，所餘的油料也巳有限了。</p>
<p>妓女是軍政商的寄生虫，尤其是在這戰亂的年頭，生得沒有着落的女人被迫得只有定這修路。省政府劃定大東茅巷等幾條巷子讓登記的妓女居住，晚間在門前懸掛綠色三角燈。但登記的只有一〇一人，因爲怕太「招搖」了反而影響營業。這幾條巷子原是長沙閥閱人家集聚之所，現在不知由誰作主。把來改設飯店和旅館。在這區域裏的旅館的旅客，一覽表上，有一半以上是寫着『陳艷秋女士』，「簫紅玉女士」之類的名宇，而且下面註明「長住」，是很技巧的廣吿方法。廢曆年前，旅館裏可以打牌，現在是禁止了。</p>
<p>長沙市政府歸倂縣政府後，警察局改屬省政府，附設市政科管理市政。兵役，鄉鐘保甲，恤金，積穀等項、最近己由縣政府辦理。過去長沙市每月應徵集壯丁二百人，長沙縣一千人。大火前後，人口疏散，現陸續歸來，巳開始補徵。去年十一月及十二月應懲未徽壯丁，全縣原有千餘保，壯丁約九萬餘人，現辦七百餘保，平均每保每月抽懲二人出征。出征人迄至目前止，共一萬四千餘人，爲國犧牲者的恤金年達十餘萬元，惟因各部隊調動無定，番號又常有爲更改，中上級軍官亦有調動或殉職者，致出征人家屬爲無法調査征人存亡，或獲得陣亡的證明文件，以便請恤，此事有關役政前途的利鈍，且各地情形相同，當局似亟應設法解决。至於食糧方面，大火時損失甚大，又因市民散居四鄕，縣境駐軍亦多，目下亦稍成問題，省府及縣府正發給護照，以便人民將存　鄰近各縣的米穀運回調節</p>
<p>米　公費後，現在巳化爲軍民合作站了。在湘北，現有第×戰區政治部發動組織的四處，當地人民組織的三處，它們主要的任務是代過境的　隊採辦柴米油鹽，免得軍隊向人民直接購買時發生或有的麻煩。每站並有義務輸送隊數十人，由當地學生和壯丁組織，按站抬送受傷將士。不過軍隊運動，也時常須要佚役，最初縣政府要幾十幾百人都很容易，後來因爲有若干部隊不讓伕役們在到達某一地點後囘鄕，現在比較困難了。人民對於不勞民的軍隊批評它是好軍隊。第八十九師過長時沒有需要民，就有好幾個農民對我談起它。但如本鄉工作，民衆仍踴躍參加。留如長沙附近國防工事，現在就有民佚×千人在工作，破壞鐵路公路，也大都是他們的力量，</p>
<p>三月的長沙，巳從焦土上復蘇過來，因爲偉大的中華民族，原是最經得起災難，最勇於創造的民埃！（，一九三九，三，二二，在長沙。）</p>

<p>【路社透柏林一日電】此間晨報對於張伯倫宣言之重要性、極不法重、謂該宣言並未使德國感覺絲毫不安、相信各報之緩和批評係奉令遵辦者、俾希特勒今日之演脫更可驚人也、『人民觀察報』稱、『張怕倫之宣言、有意的或無意的、表一示種毒化德、波關係之趨勢』、又『德國時棵」稱，『德國　此宣言爲缺乏解　與　率之連鎖中、又一新的聯　』云、</p>

<p>（四）德海軍部主辦之「海事報」且認、『俄國今日之潛水艇艦隊、在艦數上實比任何國家超越』、</p>
<p>陳氏同時並指出孟却斯特報之結論、該報稱、「無論是在歐洲、抑在遠東、一個强有力的蘇俄、是和平的一個强有力的保證」、</p>
<p>陳氏至是乃徐徐的說：『希特勒之所以能横行中歐、日本少壯軍人之所以能在中國鱟横無理、大舉侵略、厥因中，英，法一當局中未能時及興蘇俄切實合作、時至今日、如要有效的對付侵略國家之威脅、亦只有與蘇俄切實合作之一途」、</p>

<h3>突尼斯風云　（續完）</h3>
<p>— 楊璧譯楊璧譯</p>
<p>這種打開歷史，算舊帳的方法，自然，無補於大局，而况且現在，法國人，意大利人，巴比人，摩爾人，猶太人，阿拉伯人及其他土人，在突尼斯，不都居處一隅，相安無事嗎？在突尼斯境內，意大利人民是自有其勢力範圍的，許多地方，全意大利化了。甚至于，在那些地方的遊客，也帶上了些意大利色彩。剛上突尼斯去跑跑的人，總常常覺得，那要的意大利人較法國人爲多，但本年的人口調査，却指出法國人的確比意大利人多。意大利對這調査的數宇，永遠是提出異議的，她的理由，便是脫，許多意大利的移民，都被迫着入了法國籍了。</p>
<p>這種統計的爭執。當然是索然乏味的；事實供在，法國在突尼斯有着行政機關，突尼斯在法國管理之下，也是異常昌順，依這樣的情形看來，誰肯相信法國會逼得甘願讓人，自然，那幷不是一定不可能，而是英國也决不會容許她讓人的吧。</p>
<p>然而，無晚如何，到現在，突尼斯的確已經成了問題了。要苟且偷安，巳經不可能。除非法國乾脆把突尼斯奉讓於意大利去統治。其實，突尼斯的一切，意大利早佔上了一分。在那里，意大利享受着種種特權：自治權，土地權，國籟權。論理，法國是老早可以對這些事實提出異議的，但竟沒有人敢挺身這樣做。而反過來，莫索里尼雖跟頓伐爾在一九三五年，簽訂過相安的協定，但他竟以法國曾經發動「制裁」爲藉口，現在全一氣打銷了。自然，問題終於不得不展開，雖然法國想躲，但意大利却在緊逼。</p>
<p>這個問題到底如何解决，現在誰也難說。但我們以爲唯有和和氣氣的才是正路，寄語莫索里尼，請別東施效顰希特勒，再來什麽戰爭威脅，要知道，現在的歐洲壁壘巳經顯然兩樣了。苦頭是自討的。</p>
<h3>德示意斯洛伐克　對匈讓步　雙方劃界問題細節　明日可望解決</h3>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>汪精衛的「例」</h3>
<p>汪精衛三字在每個有熱血有骨氣的中國人心目中作何印象，我們暫不置論，汪精衛今日仍自由發表其字，一定引起每一個愛國國民的憎惡與憤怒，即將會必然的事實。不過我們也不像加以評論。我們所以仍願不惜汙及筆墨而可　者談談的，是昨天××日報努表汪精衞一篇『舉一個例』的長文，迎合日本侵略者之意，挑撥離間我全國的團結，破壞我政府政黨與人民間的共信互信，的個一「例」！</p>
<p>汪精衛這篇文字開頭為曾仲嗚掩飾其輕索固家職守×××××××××而譽之「爲國事而死』，此種顚倒是非的「例」，所在多有，不自在始，姑不具論。該文接　寫了篇『國防最高會議第五十四次常務委員會議』的『記錄』，說的是廿六年十二月（注意！當時蔣委員長在南京領　抗戰精衞在漢口召集的一次會讓，詳記外次徐　報吿與德大使隋德曼談判所謂　解中日戰事的經過，這個『記錄』的是否可靠，或是紀錄中徐謨報吿的是否眞正如此，我們固須採取絕對保留的態度。但是就算在精衛這篇文章中所引的完全可靠，也不過是說當時日本的帮手德國，曾經派其駐華大使向我當局進行所謂調解，少數親日份子如在精衛亦甘贊助此事，以助日本屈服中國，而結果則遭我當局拒絕。不管叛徙漢奸怎樣硬指若干政府領袖亦曾首肯和　，但事實勝於雄辯，當時日本侵略者利用國際幫手和在華帮手實行和平誘降的陰謀，終因爲我最髙領袖接受全民公意而加以無情的擊破了！汪精衛今日猶想誣蔑領袖拖人入水，甚至寫出三個所謂問題，也因吾領袖圑結全國堅持抗戰的事實的答覆，而成爲無的放矢，×××××××××反噬的一個「例」</p>
<p>注精衛這篇文章接着又有所謂「爲國民一言」，又是所謂『和戰大計』，此在我們國民，厭聞已久。我們仍不妨逐條略加指斥。第一，汪稱：『條件而不妨及國家之生俘獨立，主和有何不可』，然則捷克去年與德議和，且有德國與英法保證其生存與獨立的慕尼黑協定，何以卒有今日減亡之禍？主和者豈非要我國遭捷克第二？第二，在稱『以抗戰爲對內統一的手段，我絕對反對；主和不會妨害統一，不主和也不會分裂，事實上中國以抗戰求解放而有統一並非以『抗戰爲對內統一的手段』，叛徒投降份子曲解抗戰砷聖意義，甚至公然反對統一，主張分裂，其爲日×謀誠可謂忠，第三在誣共黨是以搗亂爲天性，但事實上西安事變，以共黨之努力而　平禍亂，促成統一。况自抗戰以來，共黨矢誠中　服從領袖，領導民衆，堅持抗戰；想在精衛亦知其事實照然，奈非　共黨則何以博日×的歡心？想在誠不得己哉」行爲的「一個例」！在情衛這篇文章，除上述外，以下都是沙錄日×宣傳品的原文，什麽「我所誠心誠意以求的是東亞百年大計』，實在太不值得汚我筆墨。末了，他終於吐露寫這篇女章的眞意了！他說『聞得國民政府（這是日×稱我中央的口氣）正在努力促成國際調停，這是可以的，然而至少國際調停與直接交涉同時並行，如此，則我以在野之身，從旁協助，亦不爲無補。』原來他還想中國與日×舉行「直接交涉」，他好以親日份子的身扮來『從旁協助』其實所謂『國民政府正在努力促成國際調停』原是日×的惡意造謠，己有陳誠部長的　正痛斥，現在汪又舊謠重發，可謂善體日×之意！不知有人民的「一個例」！</p>
<p>但是，這不是簡單的一篇文章，也不只是在精衞自暴其醜惡的『一個例』。我們要知道，日×侵略軍事，泥足陷水益深，急以政治陰謀，以圖解救。最近故意散佈國際調停的謠言，誇大中德關係的轉變，目的只在削弱我政府在民衆中在國際上的威信，其在挑撥離間我國內　結與國際關係，只在停止中國團結抗戰，而圖實現誘降實現征服中國，在精衞對日，可謂先意承旨，曲盡妙處了！</p>

<h3>本報電影戲劇週刊二次座談會　歡迎中國劇團</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>昨日在九龍城寰樂園舉行</p>
<p>心在跳動，熱淚在眼眶裏滾着。在感愧交集中，個個人那恍然醒覺非重新復活起來做一個中華民族所需要的兒女不可。這個集會的收穫眞是太豐富了。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：昨天中午十二時，本報電影戲劇週刊在九龍寰樂園舉行第二次電影戲劇座談會、並歡迎中國救亡劇團。出席者除我們所熱烈歡的金山，王瑩，林樞三位鬥士之外，就是電影戲劇界的先進與熱心的工作者，如：蔡楚生，費穆，司徒慧敏，膚教，趙英才，唐若靑，李淸，黄達才，朱白水，李殊倫等。（歐陽予倩先生因事，胡春冰先生因病，未能趕到）園外的風景，空氣是那麽幽靜，新鮮，爲港九不可多得的勝地。園内幾十位熱情，前進的文化工作者是那樣親密地傾談着。這是象微着香港的另一面。</p>
<p>陸浮先生首先致詞，就把個別的談話，轉到座談的形式，從電影戲劇在現階段的重要生談判我們對於中國救亡劇團應該致崇髙的敬意，與熱烈的歡迎。就在這樣熱烈的歡迎中，英俊，活潑的金山先生開始打動在座者的心坎了。</p>
<p>『在香港苦幹的先生眞是使我太感動了。我們首先要向諸位致熱烈的敬禮！在高度的興奮中，我所要說的話是沒有組織的，讓我想到什麽，就說什麽。</p>
<p>『我們自從八一三離開上海，從事救亡戲劇運動到現在已經足足十九個月了。我們在大時代中學習，，時間沒有「點兒的浪費。我們從親身的經歷中，是覺得非常樂觀的。樂觀什麽？簡單一句話：中國是有辦的。</p>
<p>——金山先生，興奮地，熱切地再三說，中國是有辦法的。並引了很多事實證明這不是抽象的口號或是自慰之詞。</p>
<p>接着，金先生起勁地報吿他們一年來在內地工作的經過，那眞是太使人感奮了。又林樞先生報吿他參加作戰的經騐，談到將士英勇的地方，他情不自禁地掉下熱淚，大家的內心亦深地起了共鳴。王瑩女士補充中國的進步，要是不到前綫去，是不會相信的。軍民合作的情形實在太好了。抗戰一面在生長，一面在毀滅。雖然目前痛苦一些，前途是絕對樂觀的。</p>
<p>聽了三位來自前綫的鬥士的報吿之後，蔡楚生立刻起來說很多人所要說的話：我慚塊到應該自殺，我感　到應該馬上囘到祖國的懷抱。繼續就是談到今後戲劇的話。費穆先生亦情不自禁地說我們應該馬上來一個號召：</p>
<p>留在香港的化人應提出他留港的理由，拿出工作出來，不然，就該釗末皇台跳海自殺。</p>
<p>我們應該在香港做中國救亡劇團的後盾，使他們長征到海外，現在，讓我們大家來研討如何帮助他們。</p>
<p>司徒慧敏先生對於加强反文化漢奸的運動，和今後聯系的工作亦有一番精惕的發揮。</p>
<p>還有：盧敦，李淸，葉堅，李殊侖等相繼發表意見，最來，就是討論具體的辦法，眞是一個偉大的收穫。</p>
<p>心在跳動，熱淚在眼眶裏滾着。在感愧交集中，個個人都恍然醒覺到來王台跳海自殺是弱者的表示，復活起來做一個中華民族的所需要的兒女才是我們應走的大路。（請參閱今日本報第六版電影戲劇週刊）</p>

<p>什麼是路？就是從沒有路的地方殘踏出　的，只有從棘荆的地方開闢出來的。</p>
<p>新　電影戲劇</p>
<p>在中國底文化上，本來就沒有戲劇這一條路，有之，以屬於建設的產物，陡供少數人的欣賞，從不想到羣衆里面去的：自從新的戲劇運動，展開以後，她就像中華民族革命似的，負起帝反封建的變重任務，「七七」民族抗戰展後，全世界的目光，都注視着中華民族的生死的搏鬥，從這時候起，新的戲劇運動，更成爲中國新文化運動壹重要部門。新的戲劇的運動，跟軍事一樣，是一日比一日堅實起來，一日比一日進步起來。一般前進的戲劇工作者，離開了都市，組成數十分隊，到前綫去，到農村去，到後方去，到處都發揮了戲劇的宣傳民衆，敎育民衆的藝術任務，內容與形式，都急激好轉，密切地配合抗戰的需要，英勇地肩起新時代的偉大的任務，形成了抗戰文化運動中最前進最强韌的一部門。</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團，就是這部一門裏一技最努力最英勇的精兵，他們原來上海話劇界救亡協會戰時演劇第二隊。自『八一三以後，卽離滬到各地去宣傳，先後經過蘇州，南京，徐州，開封，麻城，後來再沿粵漢路南下，轉湘入桂，一路以演劇歌詠去敎育民衆，動員民衆，宣傳民衆，因爲生活的嚴肅，工作的努力，到處鄱得到軍政當局和社會人士的讀計與歡迎，現在他們把救亡宣傳撥展到海外去，同時，替前綫將士向僑胞呼籲，特决定前往南洋新嘉坡，菲律賓，　香山，一帶演劇，並從事演講，展覽影片等。</p>
<p>座談會的意義</p>
<p>本刊爲進一步聯絡感情，展開集體討論；及對該團表示敬佩的微意，就趁着這個機會於昨日——參看本報特寫，第二次電影戲劇座談會，同時歡迎該團的團長金山先生，副團長王瑩女士，及隨　出發　慰僑胞的軍事家林樞先生。正午十二時許大家都就座了。主陸浮起立發言，大意是這樣的：</p>
<p>——各位先生，各位同，今天是申報電影座談會第二次茶會。（略）本來，這個座談會是準備每兩三個星期舉行一次的，但自從一月二十五日舉行第一次會後，到現在差不多兩個月了。這是因爲大家的工作都　忙，尤其是我們自已報館工作者、忙得不開交。眞是抱歉得　。這一次舉行座談會的意義，除了和上次一樣外同時幷歡迎中國救亡劇團出國宣傳過港，籍　敬意。同時有幾點意見，在這里提出。第二：希望該隊的領隊者，把他們一年多來，從各地從事救亡劇運的情形和經騐，提供出來，供我們作工作的參攷和敎訓；第二點：希望在座各位先進同志，根據他們寶貴的經驗和嚴訓之後，針對現階段，尤其是本港這個特殊環境的救亡運動實踐諸問題，來一個熱烈的討論：雖然國內的工作方式能完全適應這個特殊的地方，但他們的工作經驗是可以使我們得到許多寳貴的參考和嚴訓的；第三：我們希望在座各位先進，各位同志，對於該團，除了烽以火歸來的兄弟姊妹之情，熱烈歡迎之外，爲了整個劇運的前途，爲了整個民埃的解放鬭爭，更應該多作實際工作上的帶助，使他們獲得應有的成績。</p>
<p>在掌笑下，陸浮坐下來，同時在掌笑下，金山先生起來了。</p>
<p>金山先生客氣坦白，但講起來，却口若懸河，滔滔不絕。金先生講得多，而這里所紀其中一部，而且是大會。</p>
<p>金山先生的話</p>
<p>金先生的第一點是：由於十九個月的抗戰，我們得到一個經驗。就是：中國是樂歡的，中國是有辦法的。十九個月的過程，許多鐵一般的事情吿訴我們，抗戰是必勝的。華僑對組視抗；支持鍛力，將來勝利後，政府一定會囘答僑胞，保障衛胞；第二點是：我是演員，講表演吧。從前在都市，表演一個都市靑年，我可以：可是表演一個農民，我不得。農民比在座的李淸先生還要髙，還要大，性情，舉動，都有個性。現在找接觸過了，我知道了，我相信可以演，雖不能十足但能像幾分，能像幾分。</p>
<p>實踐中的教益</p>
<p>金先生重複講，停了二停，接着：——這次跑入內地，比入大學强得多，有許多的新劇人，比我們還好。這是實感，不是空話。他們確信抗戰必勝，他們了解政冶，他們了解國際，以最大的熱情，貢献一切。比如一個鬼子來，他把鬼子打死，這眞情的表現比我們眞實，使我感動得流淚。他們的人演劇的情緒都是由內而發的，所以特別容易感動軍衆。他們所表露學。從實生活中體念眞實經　。</p>
<p>今後戲劇運動</p>
<p>，內害針對民衆的要求；二，善用舊形式的進新內容；三，工作人員的私生活要嚴肅；四，要誠懇精；五，澈底的政治認識。</p>
<p>——先生談到今後戲劇運動，應注意點之後，再嚴重地說明我們有這樣好的將士，這　好的民衆，這樣好的靑年，中國實在是有辦此法的。所以特別要到南洋一行，使僑胞知道他們出的錢，出的力，是不會白費的；將來一定得到報酬的。</p>
<p>『希望到南洋一行之後、能够實現在祖國設立傷兵收容站，收容所、文化供應站，人與工藝所收容殘發軍人出征家屬、陣亡將士家屬……</p>
<p>最末、金先生謂『這不是一　人或是一個團體的事情、而是整個文化界當前的任務、我們只是一個哨兵、寧死不怯、要求諸位做我們的後盾』</p>
<p>的是家破入亡的眞情感，他們的進步，他們的力量眞是太驚人了。中國人新興的戲劇，就是寄托在這些新的鬥士上面。我深深地覺得從前所研究的一套什麽舞台的遂技術，綫條與姿態之美，都是沒有用的，不含感動羣</p>
<p>衆的。所以，我們亦跟他</p>
<p>林　先生的話</p>
<p>接着林樞先生報吿一點點於軍事的故事，最動人的是：</p>
<p>——在某處一天老百姓司令部問：是是不到來明一天出發呀，」我奇怪爲什什麽軍事消息，有人知　呢。於是調各班長來開座談　，才知道士兵在出發前一天，把所有給予鄉民，因爲他們立定必死之决心，而民衆一見此情形，便知調動。</p>
<p>由此，證明士兵的肯　牲的精神。這精神就是必勝的左券。</p>
<p>王瑩女士的話</p>
<p>王塋女士的話是這樣的；我們是　進步了，這次抗戰，一面成長；一面死滅，凡只腐敗的，都在炮火中消滅了，最後她說軍民合作的爲象，决勝的證明。</p>
<p>在慚愧發奮中</p>
<p>跟着蔡　生起頭發言，句句沉痛。要點有二，一，戲劇不該專認髙等華人看成爲上層階級欣賞品。而應深入羣衆。同時　强統一戰綫，加强政治認識，二：內容避免空洞理論，講老實話，講能給引起羣衆共鳴的話，內容該有血有肉，反映現實；他還　嚴肅地說：站在國家的立場是軍事第一，勝利第一，站在戲劇的立場則應該是效果第一。要是在一次公演之後，收不到敎育作用，政治作用的效果，任你怎樣考究怖景，姿態，舞台技術等等表面的東西，都是失了戲劇的眞正價值。正如陸浮先生所說的出了戲院就上餐室舞廳去，這種戲　是要不得的。技巧的表現手叚正確的人生觀與政治認識，才是戲劇的骨幹。費移的意見是這樣；留港的劇人，沒有工作的，立刻囘去；反之，立刻工作起來，以同答中國救亡劇團。司徒慧敏擊電影商人，假借抗戰片在南洋被禁，請該團到南洋切實調査。使對於客觀環境有正確的估價。是否抗戰的要禁？是否連後方反漢奸的都禁？甚至連中國人愛中國的都不講？同時主張嚴格評　文化漢奸，評擊毒素　影。盧敦對香港話劇亦有詳細的叙述，特別提供香港話劇在智識份子逗圈子，是不對的，對含有毒素電影，也予以批評，自謂自已尙可救藥，望希大家覺醒。李淸說寧願餓殍也不拍毒素電影，對金山表敬意，每句話都愼重而認眞，費穆說他有爲，大家鼓掌，而趙英才也主張肅清毒素電影。</p>
<p>在熱烈的空　下，足足討論了幾個鐘頭才散會，拍照茶會而結束了，</p>
<h3>我們朝着一個方向</h3>
<p>— 王瑩</p>
<p>這一次的抗戰，對外是民族戰爭，對內是革命戰爭。一面是趨於死滅，一面却在成長了起來。</p>
<p>在今天，不分前方與後方，工作的重要性與意義是同樣的。到了××，雖然嗅不着火藥氣，可是，工作上的困難與阻礙是與戰地不能比的；在戰地樂觀而自由工作的人，到了××見到可尊敬的朋友們，在窒息中苦幹的情神，使我感動。</p>
<p>我們是朋友，同志，我們的×人是共同的，我門的目的是一致的，我們朝着了一個方向——把一切献給國家興抗戰！</p>
<p>三月卅一日於中國救亡　團</p>
<h3>歡迎中國救亡劇團！</h3>
<p>過去，中國話劇運動只是在都市智識份子市民　里兒圈子。始終沒有眞正地走向　大羣衆的面前，因此，中國的話劇運動雖然也有了相當的歷史，可是並沒有長出美好的果，得不到廣大社會的支持，廣大羣衆的愛好；而只成功像象牙塔里的古董一樣的，僅獲得了少數所謂智慧親衆們茶餘酒後的欣賞！</p>
<p>司是，自徒神聖的民族自衛戰展開了以後，話劇運動獲得了一個新生的機會，開拓了一條新的活路，眞正地走向羣衆，深入了農村，從　地建立起民衆的戲劇！</p>
<p>『中國救亡劇團」就是這一方面的工作者之一，他們從中國最大的都市——上海作爲起點，放棄了固人　裕的都市的享受，跑到內地去，而且跑到戰區去，在充滿火藥味危險的區域里冒着生命爲祖　而服務！</p>
<p>他們，一方面在替祖國服務，拿着他們的工具——戲劇去喚起民衆抗×的熱情，以至於組織民衆，爲抗戰而服務；在另一方面，他們在未來的中國話劇運動底建設而努力，從抗戰中獲取經驗，從廣大的民衆學習，以爲將來新生的民挨戲劇底創造的基礎！</p>
<p>在這兩重的重大意義之下，「中國救亡劇團」同志們底艱苦的工作是值得我們敬佩的，尤其是他們刻苦勇敢犧牲的精神，是我們躱在後方的靑年們所應該學習的。</p>
<p>如今，「中國救亡劇團」到了香港來了，可是他們並不是退却，更不是逃避，而正是他們新的工作的開始！</p>
<p>他們要到海外去了，把從戰區里所得到的關於抗戰底英勇的故事，尤其是以種種經歷証明了最後勝利必屬於我的信念，而加强僑胞對祖國的熱情，這是一個意義重大的任務！</p>
<p>我們僅以摯誠預祝「中國救亡劇團」此行獲得成功，爲了祖國，爲了話劇運動的前途！</p>
<p>中華民族禹歲！</p>
<h3>迎「中國救亡劇國」到港</h3>
<p>香港青年戲劇協會</p>
<p>在髙度的然烈底渴望中，中國『救亡劇團」終寬到達香港了。</p>
<p>他們要經港出國的訊息，在很久以前開始　散于我們當中，我們是那樣的渴望着這隊伍底駕臨，可是悠長的時光增加了我們的焦急和渴望，然而，却也增加了我們的心願，這種心願，是具有崇髙的敬仰之感的！</p>
<p>如今，他們是以珊珊遲來的姿態出現于我們的面前了。</p>
<p>在抗戰後，爲中國戲劇史上光榮地寫下一頁紀錄的上海戰劇界救亡協會戰時移動演劇隊，是爲任何人所深悉的，曾先後組織十五隊從上海出發散跑到東西南北各戰塲各後方去，遍履農村，工塲，兵營，醫院，戰壕等角落的，以最煽動最積極性的形式發揮着高度的突擊底効能。</p>
<p>「上海救亡演劇第二隊」這有着嚮亮的名字底隊伍。更深刻地印在我們的腦中，從八一三事變後他們即從上海輾囀地遍踏南京，徐州，開封，鄭州，洛陽，漢口。及麻城等地方，再溯沿粵漢鐵路南下轉湘入桂的，在堅忍與　苦中工作，現在，更以「中國救亡劇團」的名義應桂省當局的懇邀到海外作抗戰宣傳及爲前方將士呼　。</p>
<p>這種富有鬥爭的精神，民挨革命戰爭的勇士式的表現，從任何方面而言都值得我們畢習和步武的；這種苦幹沉毅而具有中華民族優秀的兒女的本色的工作者，毫無疑意地將爲我們今後服務于抗戰中底模範者。站在同陣綫的戲劇工作者而言，特別是處在靡娓的失了祖國的抱懷的香島的我們。將更爲我們所致予深切的崇敬。</p>
<p>在殖民地的香港，××　　　　　　　　　　　常遙望烽火遍地的祖國，使我們感到慚愧，也感到責在的靡鮮，因此，我們也曾以强靱的姿態工作者，鬥爭着，在我們的崗位上做着香港文化救亡運動的尖兵戰鬥員。</p>
<p>但，不可否認的是我們戰鬥的力量太薄弱；工作底表現配合不上祖國現階段的抗戰是明顯的，同樣也追縱不上在祖國原野中鬥爭着的工作者。</p>
<p>這裏，我們應當引爲慚愧的，羞怯的，我們應當學習，我們應當更强　地鬥爭，爲了祖劇，爲了自由和温暖！</p>
<p>因此，在劇壇烽火中有着「夏伯陽」底英雄姿熊的救亡劇團，在此時當是我們最良好的學習者和模範者呵！</p>
<p>同樣，我們懇切地向中國救亡劇團的伙伴們要求，在這次出國過港的當中，以先行者底態度賜予工作在香港底我們以正確的指導，經驗的敎訓，祇有這樣，在同崗位上，我們會緊密地携手起來，在祖國抗戰中、　強烈地揮發着戲劇鬥爭力量！</p>
<p>最後，我們歡快而情深地寄意，願這次出國、是把祖國底艱辛，將士們底英勇，同胞們的慘苦，×人底×××到海外去，宣示給僑胞們，幷且堅决地吿訴他們：祖國在勝利中行　着呵！勝利，在向着我們揮招！</p>
<p>謹此，我們香港靑年戲劇協會向這夥英勇的伙伴們致以忱熱的歡迎與崇髙的敬慰！</p>
<p>廿八年四月一日，香港。</p>
<h3>戰區裏的戲劇工作</h3>
<p>— 金山</p>
<p>「八一三」滬戰爆發，我隨隊出發到內地去工作，經過蘇，皖，豫，鄂，湘，桂，　諸省，歷時十九個月，同無數農民，士兵，政工青年相接觸，我漸漸覺得我的生命上增加了一些光輝和力量；有時我還興奮得流淚，因爲，我看出了我們燦爛的前途。</p>
<p>青年學生富家子，全都拋掉了學校和家庭，跑向窮鄉僻讓去了，他們都是有計劃地組織了許多演劇宣傳隊，他們未曾　過戲劇專校，也未曾讀過表演術，然而在他們的工作中說明了他們都是優秀的民衆藝術家。他們有鼓動民衆和組織民衆的本領，他們的戲劇也就是民眾所最喜悅最受感動的戲劇；爲什麽嗎？因爲他們具有兩種基本條件：第一，他們有豐富的政治認識，他們無時無刻不在研討着抗戰形勢和國際問題，因此他們對抗戰前途的估計是非常　確和樂觀的，從他們的言語行動中吿訴了民衆「抗戰是必勝」！第二，他們有一種可責的熱情，在舞台上他門用眞誠去激動觀衆啟發觀衆。我常和工作同志說：我們不需要舞台上的行屍走肉，我們需要一个鮮活的靈魂在觀衆面前跳躍，我們所做所講的都是活生生的現實，我們要獲得觀衆的共鳴，這種「共嗚」，說不上是「演技」，但我們相信這幷不違背了斯坦尼司拉夫斯基的「心靈的寫實主義一的寅劇原理的。</p>
<p>我們需要學習，不斷地學習，不斷地在　生活學中習，十九月來，在我所經過的地方上，看到許多新奇的人物，在我們精衛的體驗中看透了那每一人物的形體和內心，這對于我們演劇是有莫大帮助的。</p>
<p>在這里我想簡單說一說在戰區苦幹着的靑年的生活：一般的說來，在各戰區都有戰地服防隊或救亡劇隊的組織，他們的生活和士兵農民沒有兩樣；在鄂豫皖邊區，他們都散佈在各個紅槍會里面，如果他們不對你直接談話（或討論一個問題），你是不會相信他們是知識份子的，在過去六官固始一帶，曾有些農民自已組織的劇團，演起戲來，動不動就是數百個人的羣衆塲；他們跳躍，他們怒吼，他們有用不盡的活力，選里面又　是進步的劇運靑年在領導着的，我們在大別山要和農民生活了兩個多月，農民對我們訴述他們的苦况和期望，而且樂于聽取我們的意見，也都是在看了我們的戲受了感動之後的事。</p>
<p>在戰區裏，靑年們都以不能和民衆共同生活爲恥辱，從朝到晚他們都在設法怎樣神今天的工作做好，工作控制着他們的神經，終日是刺激，與奮，沒有憂愁，沒有失望。</p>
<p>我有一個不甚精確的統計，卽是農民受了政工人員的激動，尤其是戲劇的影響，因而自動參加抗戰的，數在兩千萬以上，這是一個驚人的記錄，而且我相信這記錄將要不斷地配台着抗戰新形勢而繼續擴大起來。</p>
<p>在大別山里演戲的時候農民們都担了米袋來看戲，看完了戲就煮飯，吃完了飯就在林叢或草台上睡覺，準備明天再看。（那時農忙已過）</p>
<p>而演員呢？也就和他們睡在一齊，有說有笑。這一種情景，至今還印在我的腦謨滅。</p>
<p>離開了祖國，不由地懷念起我的工作同志來，在中國新興劇運上，他們有不可磨把的功績。我更懷念那些純良挨質的農民；他們仍在和敵人拚命：祝他們康健！</p>
<p>香港，給了我很好的印象，儘管是「歌舞昇平」，但在另一方面也有許多朋友在設法怎樣地把一班落後的靑年轉向到比較進步的路上去，他們組織了演劇的社團，祈望轉移這一些人的興趣，這也是相當艱難的工作，我希望他們能有在戰區的友人一樣的精上，而且與戰區的劇運很好的配合起來。</p>
<p>我很髙興能在這兒看到許多可愛的友人，我希望和這些友人緊緊地握手！</p>
<h3>舞台技術講話</h3>
<p>— 盧敦</p>
<p>六　節奏與速律</p>
<p>T一切的存在都具有節　——瞬息千變的晚霞，和在二個世紀內不過才移動兩寸的冰山都同樣地具有節奏。節奏是一種無窮的，永恒的韻律，一切創造的東西都依賴節奏而生存，——以有限轉化爲無窮而生存　。R．Boloslavsky說：「節奏是一件藝術品中所包含的一切不司的要素之有次序的，有節度的變化的一而這一切變化一步一步地起欣賞者的注意，繼續地引導他們接觸藝術家底最後的目的。</p>
<p>戲劇　術起源於原始人類的舞蹈，舞蹈是最節奏的時間藝術。而今日演員之表演也就是從原始的舞蹈演化而來的，因此，演員的表演亦同樣地具有節　的。</p>
<p>整個戲劇演出之進行，自有其一定的「速律」Tempo——這可以晚就是一種節奏。而每個演員的表演亦應自有其一定的「速律」。雖然這「速律」是完成於演出的進行中，但却必須於演出之前予以决定，早就該安排好了。</p>
<p>有時候，我們看見演員在舞台！好像是在背書，一切動作索然無味，以致毫不能引起觀眾的興趣來，這就因為演員的表演沒有了節奏。</p>
<p>劇　不是書　，劇　之內，演員必須有一種力量足以維繁着觀衆的心情，迫使他忍耐地從頭到尾欣賞你的表演而不　懈，「一步一步地激起欣賞者的注意，繼續地　導他們接觸藝術家底最後目的」這種力量之完成，是得力於演技之節奏的。</p>
<p>所謂節奏，不外是「快」，「中和」，「慢」這三個原則，就像音樂的調子一樣，俗語就是「抑揚頓挫」，唯其如此，才能發生變化，在不斷的變化中，才能够保持觀眾的好奇心，吸引觀衆的注意力，而忘記了困坐於劇　的苦悶。</p>
<p>「沒有鬥爭，沒有戲劇，」這是解　戲劇原理的名句，而今樣的亦可作爲演技原理的解釋。鬥爭，就展開了衝突，在衝突之中，自然發生了危機與髙潮，積小危機而成大危機，從小的髙潮進展至最髙潮而成劇峯，戲劇的進展是曲線的，波浪形的演員的表演，亦須把握到這一點，當演員　到了劇本，研究理解了自已所飾演的角色性格之後，就可以着手計劃對這角色的演出，找出了最高峯的所在，就把精力集中於這一地方，儘能力來表現之，此外就找每幕，每一出場，每一節，甚至於每一個動作的髙峯，要注意的就是在每一個髙峯之前必須有預備髙峯，這樣才得連貫，不覺得突然。一切的高峯都是爲了「最髙峯」而預備，「最髙峯」的表現力量必須較出色於次髙峯以及其他髙峯，否則你的表演仍然是失敗的，因爲節奏的　子已經錯亂了。</p>
<p>當然節奏並不只是指對話中音調的節拍而言，應該包含着動作在內演員，演的就是對活與動作的頭來到去的組合，語調節奏與動作的節奏，正好比對活　動作之別之必須有着有機連繫一樣，是必得相五調和而不衝突的，都向着同一的目的發　着統一的作用。</p>
<p>演員表演的節奏司以分作兩方面：「自覺的節奏「與」相互的節奏」關於自覺的節奏」，R．Boloslavsky說：「第一是走路，第二是言語，第三是情感。每一步路，每一句話，每種情感都是生生不息的變化下去，每一方面都有同樣的歸依，都有一個最後的目標。」等到這些能够練習到可以由自我自由操縱的時候，當外力把他們的節奏反映到來的時候於是是新的節奏就開發了。這新節奏的創造巳經不是個人的，而是共同的了，這時候已經是合唱，而不是獨唱了，因此你的音色與調子必須與對方統一，卽是所謂呼吸一致，彼此一來一去之間，必須得着諒解，互相制約，產主「相互的節奏」創造統一的氛圍。</p>
<p>表演底節奏之創造，是必須經過演員本身苦心的計劃與安排的，因此可　作爲特別演員勤怠優劣的標準，亦可作爲演員抓取觀衆注意力的最好工具。【未完】</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>星華隊初試新戰遭敗衂　畢竟南華勝一籌　星華短傳術甚好惟用不得當徒勞往返</h3>
<p>今日戰港選隊謝慶福決上陣</p>
<p>（本報專訊）自南洋囘的星華『老倌』、昨天在此間排演『頭檯戲』、紅男綠女、共登加山、約計人數、十千過外、港菲埠際賽之熱鬧情形、復見於昨日，人說足球好景氣、我亦云然、還得補充一句、「高等難民」間錢多、</p>
<p>說不　昨天在場目擊戰爭的球迷們、有些對星華各員的演出、會表示失望、爲的是星華以零比散簽城卜盟、抵抗不起南華的猛擊、片面看來、似乎球藝不甚髙　，但是、失望還失望、事實上星華端的是勁旅、不過失敗另有許多原因、</p>
<p>據我所知、星洲球人素擅短傳術、昨天事實吿訴我們、眞的所見如所知、星華所採的戰略、確短傳過多、常見一內衛得球、如非相當急迫、狠步立卽把球踢出、總求有煞那間的機會、能够將球按在脚下、便盤出傳給那所站位置與他　爲接近的前衞，然後由那前衛輕傳於前鋒、有時還見前衛彼此傳交的、此種紆迴進攻戰略、用以疏散對方守將的守勢、頗爲有效、但祗可施用於塲之中部、决不可處處皆然、星華諸將、一味短傳、未免費時失事、所以進展的時候、須靠傅交凖確、才可深入、但不一定深辱便是機會、如遇着攔擊、便前功盡棄、前鋒諸人　非十分吃力、不易找得出路、但不一定找得出路便完成臨門一擊、倘被　華守將一脚勾銷、祗喚徒勞往返、因是之故、星華短傳雖妙美、跑步雖快捷、無如迂迴進攻總不及達交近攻相機而行來得有效、卽使有效、諸鋒又非擅射、幾次可勝之球、均失諸攻門一脚、竊以爲、如星華前鋒得有南華一樣的前衞從後接濟不靠「獨沽一味」的短傳、那末、攻勢必銳許多、望今天最好設法改善、</p>
<p>萬迷共師的「新李惠堂」謝慶福、雖穿起全副武裝，却未見上火線、聽說他在菲律賓作戰時，足部微傷、俟休養多一天、今天鬥港選隊、决定上陣、還有正選鄧約翰，温關宗，夏治祥也與慶福一樣、祗作卒觀、因此、星華的戰鬥力、略受影響、如其以原班人馬登場、卽使仍敵不過南華、也至少會有一二球的囘報，這不是特替星華失敗後而來掩飾、其實、星華曾有幾個必勝機會、可惜沒有擅射的前鋒，乃致錯過、若福慶在前線，則其他良好機會可不言、單獨一倘十二碼罰球，包管他一蹴而就的、</p>
<p>看過星華各員的頂上功夫，均同聲讚美、南華陣裏、祗有梁榮照比美得上、可惜他們既擅短傳、又擅頭球、奔跑起來更如狡兔一樣、惟作戰之時、死守繩法、不曉變化、遂毋以收因時制宜之效、各守將又因受李惠堂「名」威脅、重視於其個人的行動、乃常取集中截擊法、力　惠堂、而忽視其他、反給予雨華旁敲側擊的空隙、鄧　森與楊水益、常得內鋒的供應、異常活動、頻取攻勢、卒有三球的收獲</p>
<p>南華亦以短傳稱於時、與星華同一枝派、惟南華各員能知變化、見機而作、須知道、球賽如兵戰、有體不可無用、有用不可無體，必也體用兼備、方底於成、南華各員久歷戎行、深知體用要訣、故收事半功倍之效、</p>
<p>自張榮才「出山」、包家平又添議個衣　弟子、故此近來狠少登塲、者番大戰、南華當局不選別人，獨對家平加以「靑睞」、實有深意而得材錄用之旨、爲的是家平以前多數南遊、閱歷所得、「老馬識途」、對星洲球人的『球路』、看得透切、果然昨天他的演出、妙到毫端、的是斲輪老手、</p>
<p>住我看來、星華各員的表演、最出色的當推朱成貴，氣充力足、球到人到、頭球尤有把握、昨天他雖未能完全拑制得住惠堂、但搶髙球、十不失一、惟他所採的戰略、並非第三內衛防守法、而是集中防守兼三角傳攻法、以此法而應付南華，焉有效果、</p>
<p>兩內衛陳開萬比孫春來好一點、不過仍是蹴球不能致遠、又兩人所站位置、亦常非得體、守門員李伯棠、具有妙手、撲接托拍諸技、無甚叢疵、前衛　厚坤的位置比紀发　略　、惟忽而盤球出擊、忽而退後防禦、奔走太多、終及於亂、</p>
<p>前線中　龍歷武、領導功夫雖未發揮盡致、然而狠活潑，衛刺也兇、吳占士亦有同樣的作風、翼人李海珠常能賺過李天生、便可知本領如何、蔡約翰亦有佳作、何國材則無多善處、總之、諸鋒進展動作極快、獨惜未帶「射門鞋」、</p>
<p>南華各員，表演平均都好、技術獲勝、端是不凡、如惠堂首次建功、可謂神乎其技、家平屢挽狂瀾、可謂妙手回春、又如榮照威風八面，天生力拒來師、馮景祥熨貼入微、以巧制勝、黎兆榮扶助有功、合作一致、如此這般、皆足稱道、廣森則快人快事、大「解數」，惟水益「倒亂駕鴦」、切球欠準、（球場太歲）</p>
<p>昨晚籃球賽　華南克南華　乙組警察對鐘聲亦勝一分　春風以五五比三七勝嶺英</p>
<p>公開男子籃球賽、昨晚首場、乙組警察對鐘聲、上半場鐘聲以數球佔先、迨警察極力反攻、兩度打成平手，至完場、雙方仍以三十比三十未分勝負，加時再賽、警察卒以四十一比四十僅獲勝利、次場甲組南華對華南、兩隊旗鼓相當、拚命爭奪、戰爭之劇烈、爲本屆開賽以來所僅見、在完塲前十五分鐘内、雙方曾數度平分春色、場內空氣一時爲之緊張、直至最後一分鐘、華南藉黄佐德場邊突施絕技，球兒中籃、始以五十比四十八而定大局、</p>
<p>華南之勝，當歸功于翼佐德、鐘靈及陳贊殷三台柱、但上半場未見出色，尤以射籃欠準爲最、全隊聯絡、每露破綻、因華南時而採取聯防守衛、時而以一人釘一人、故華南前鋒，無法深入、迫得以遠射出之、但十不一中、遂以十九比廿三先負上半場、</p>
<p>上半場、因南華之後勁不繼，一方因黄鐘陳等球技漸入常軌二華南頓轉有利、鑑于先前運球費時償事、乃改取反躍傳交、避免許多被對方截奪之傳遞、而黄佐德、　靈、陳贊殷所取位置，極形靈活、一傳一接、均其工夫、而射監尙時亦吿準　、迫至鐘靈四犯出場，南華乘機緊追、但華南餘威未戢卒奏凱歌。</p>
<p>南華之敗、純因後勁不繼、全隊戰員、可稱各盡其職、陸恩敬守衛有方、功不可沒、對於籃板彈球、每爲其所奪、餘如　傑民、陳新球、石振智等、上半塲殊見精彩、惜下半場表演漸露退化、陣綫凌亂、被華南乘機深入腹地、故先勝後負、竟爲華南所壓倒、</p>
<p>比賽過程，初時戰情平淡、迨華南黄佐德獲中罰球、首開紀錄、嗣後各有所獲、成爲八比七、及十三比十三時、局面逐漸趨緊張、迨華南陳新球、石振達先後中籃、反以廿一比十三、及廿五比十七佔先、直至半塲完結、華南以十九比廿五見負</p>
<p>易地再戰、黄佐德陳贊元突露鋒錺續分迎頭趕上、造成卅一比卅之平局，嗣華南一帆風順、屢以曼妙之姿態、或于塲邊側射、或于籃底推入、又成四十一比卅六之比敎、迨至鐘　四犯出埸、華南後衞頓吿多事、雙方再以四十散比四十三平手，一嗣後華南仍以一二分一路佔先、直至全場吿終、卒以五十比四十八獲勝、</p>
<p>末場乙組春風對嶺英。兩隊本爲乙組之勁旅、但嶺英昨晚戰來、未見出色、竟以三十七比五十五爲春風所敗、</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>（四分鐘）南華進兵襲擊，環攻星華後防、成貴等分頭殺無效、惠堂施射、髙出門楣、</p>
<p>（八分鐘）星中華仍受南華蹂躪、忙于招架、廣森邊境運種、兆榮右路接應、快脚一傳、懦堂以迅雷不及掩耳之箭術、在人叢中一射入網、成議比〇之局、看客咸稱妙技不置、一</p>
<p>（十二分鐘）烈武一度領隊反攻、躍髙頂射、其勢頗動、惜落界外、轉瞬間、海珠妙過重關，舉足傳中、球兒掠門前而過、約翰遲來半步、失去良機、</p>
<p>（十五分鍾）水益得景祥之傳遞、抄入左路冷然發射、差些中紅心、巳而南華擔土重來、兆榮于烟　滾滾中、轉身掃射、卒爲柏業雙手一擒、踢球出險、</p>
<p>（十九分鐘）兆漢在後防踢球、脚法不靈、「彈丸』向城前而落、家平眼見方前鋒衝陣，　高以拳頂出，烈武鞭長莫及、此時皮球爲占士所得、疾交國材、國材咬牙猛射、高出門楣一寸而逝、南華諸將揑一把汗</p>
<p>（卅二分鐘）星華　被圍困、拚命扎、突圍而出、乘盧而襲、紹漢救球心切、乘國材躍髙頂球之時、誤以背托、致令國材倒地、被罰十二碼球、成貴于裁判員未嗚號前施射入網無效、重令再射，星華乃舉約翰主刑、不料脚頭不準、球中家平之身、失去必勝機會</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>（五分鐘）南華以一比零佔先、有恃無恐、以攻爲守、星華各員思復失地、演出較以前諒解、幾度進攻、惟無效果、</p>
<p>（七分鐘）海珠傳一妙球、烈武、任士等學雙衝剌、家平又　髙以拳一頂、紙負角球、妙、</p>
<p>（十八分鐘）約翰與國材易位、得成貴之傳送、沿邊而進、及機切中、烈武　到半步，失去破關機會、</p>
<p>（廿三分鐘）南華不停進攻、連環掃射、及至國威髙吊一球時、景祥　獲一斬、「阿斗」從門角旋轉入網、美妙淸、（二比〇）勝局乃穩定、</p>
<p>（卅三分鐘）鳥倦知還、看客紛紛離座，魚　　，在此將近牧場聲　　祥傳球斤路、　　　　　　　頂、球落鹿森前，從這　射、又中紅心、成三比〇之數，南華奏凱、</p>

<h3>關於香港的學校體育　（三）</h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>（五）對千團體的活動</p>
<p>一般學校的學生、困在狹小如雀籠一樣的學校裏、整天到晚、也是接受着知識的灌輸、事實上、每個學生的腦海、都是疲乏到極，若沒有其他活動的調劑、恐怕要變成一個豬一樣的順服、一點活動能九、也不能够提得出來、我們要解央這偭問題，唯一的方法、就是提倡圑體的活動、敎育部曾通令各敎育廳轉令各學校遵照、每星期六下午、都有兩小時、至三時的課餘活動、是全體員生總動員的——近郊旅行，爬山或郊外聯歡會等、這種的活動、可以調劑學生及敎師的生活、養成團體生活的習慣、和克苦耐勞的精神、鍛鍊强健的體魄、達到普及體育的目的，希各學校、應每星期、或每月舉行一次或多次爲隹、且在這種活動之下、師更可以得到很多關于學生的檢討、在學校裏見不到的地方、也可以在這個時候看出來、使到更可以作深一層的訓導、</p>
<p>（六）過去的選手體育</p>
<p>中國數千年來的體育、其所以不能够普及、而致落後的原因、大部分都因爲以前誤認了體育目的、致得不到眞正體育訓練的效果，只製造了一般無藍不綠的風頭主義、缺乏條養的選手、所以過去的體育失敗、就在這一點，而不知道選手是普及體育裏的特產品、這都因爲一般人太遠視、了致不能看得到選手的基礎、（普及體育的訓練）、</p>
<p>香港學校的體育、還是犯了這個毛病，只注意到學校的選手訓練、利用他來出風頭、當作商店賣廣吿的一樣、我以爲尤其最可恥的、就是有些體育指導員、要利用選手來出風頭的緣故、而不顧人格的去『收買選手』來參加種種的風頭比賽、我萬二分的盼望、以體育敎育爲責任的同志們、應該能够打破了過去的選手體育的觀念、以後的選手、應由普及體育裏產生——體育訓練都能够普遍化了、才去講究選手的訓練、選手的訓練、更要以品格（體育道德）爲基礎</p>
<p>（七）珍緻的學體會</p>
<p>我所說珍緻的學體會、並沒有其他的副作用無論現在或將來所組織的、更不論誰人所發起組織的入能够眞正的爲學校體育之改良與發展而組織的、更富于服務精神、與時更新之能力的、都可以說是「珍　的舉體會、反過來說、如「掛羊頭買狗肉」的、只爲着自己的出風頭（利巳）而去組織的、對于學校體育無畀益的，都算不得是緣　的學體會、只可以說楚出風頭會、所以我最後一點的喊、還是希望着香港的學校、能够有一個眞正爲舉校體育　服務的體育會、</p>
<p>總括言之、香港一般的學校體育、還是落後、要求其發展、以達到教國體育的目的適應非常時明之要求的話、不需就　普遍化的體育着想，革除一切選手體肯、改良選手的方法，打破收買選手的惡習、提髙體育道德的水準及地位、尊重體育指導的學歷經驗與人格、與要有一個有組織的、有服務　神與能力的學體會、來領導各學校、也能够利用各種的環境、提倡活潑器械操的運動、與團體的活動等、</p>

<h3>血的教訓</h3>
<p>— 林福</p>
<p>我們英勇的抗戰，已經二十一個月了。　這種寺間中無論任前綫或後方，戰士和民衆，都發　了的很大力量，用鮮血寫下了議首最光輝的民族史詩。這將永記在華兒女們的新中。</p>
<p>血的敎訓給我們一些什麽？</p>
<p>【一】死亡率的對比。</p>
<p>抗戰爆發的時候。在京滬大會戰中，傷亡的統計，是五和一之比，六個月後，到了徐州大會戰時，便變成了二和議之比。再過六個月，等到武漢大會戰時，死亡　就又有了一個變助，成爲一個兌換一個了，最近二期抗戰，我們施用了新戰　，這個對比更有　驚人的變化，中華民族的　士一个便可以幹掉五个日本武士　的性命；可是在第二戰區的情形，就更不同了，那對比是議和十四个半啊！中這个統計數字的對比中，我們可以看出；</p>
<p>甲，中國作戰的技術，在戰爭中史加飛躍的進步了。</p>
<p>乙，堅决抗戰下去，×人的崩潰，是顯而易見；而且很快就要來到的。</p>
<p>【二】大衆的力量在戰爭中長成了。</p>
<p>抗戰展開的初期，人民還沒有積極地參加到抗戰　營中來。舉個例說；當我們在陳家行嘉定常熱一帶作戰時，軍民合作的關係，還沒有十分建立好，可是不久當我們　在浙江的孝　，議都，議帶兩次參加作戰，情形就步同了。所有送運糧食，輸送子彈，祖架傷兵等工作，完全由人民自動起來擔負了。等到到了安徽的定選，過陽，蒙城各地，民氣更旺盛，組織了很多游擊隊，運輸隊，救護隊，偵察隊，配合軍隊作戰，這顯然又更進步樂。戰區　擴大，民衆的力量是愈容易發揮的。</p>
<p>【三】擊破了××的幻夢。</p>
<p>×人最初的企圖，是不戰而勝，但我們是戰而不屈，×人想速　速決，我們持久抗戰。×人於是又放和平空氣但也絲毫不能動搖我們抗戰底的决心，現在×認正在髙唱百年戰爭，但議切不願做亡國奴的中華兒女，却非把全×人逐出國土，這个戰爭是永久不會停止的！</p>
<p>持久的全國戰爭，是不分時間空間的，我們必須要遵照最髙領袖的指示，努力爭取軍事第一，勝利第議，這就是目前最緊氤最是本的任務。</p>
<p>二八，三，三，於中國救亡劇團</p>
<h3>遙寄武漢</h3>
<p>— 胡危舟</p>
<p>從九龍尖沙咀車站　車到大埔去的路上，我意外地看見了寫着『粵漢鐵路』的車輛，使我懷念起這个散年前共過患難的摯友——武漢</p>
<p>此刻底心，孁時爬上了縷縷的舊夢，像氾濫的揚子江，再也抑不住武漢流浪三年的留戀，苦痛，和九惡的萬端情緒底澎湃！如今別後的武漢呢？</p>
<p>是九年前，一个電扇會拂出熱風的夏夜甩，我和睦招們，在日租界江邊那兒散步，滿想藉着江　透一口氣然而『嘩喇一聲』——个熱辣辣喇巴掌，突擊在我們身邊的另議个生人底臉上，接着就是……『猪仔滾！』</p>
<p>冷不防這「猪字」會發起猪性來，照樣報復他議聲『嘩喇』的；因此，那驚笛便像鬼樣的叫了；結果，『猪仔』捉不到，捉道我門「結隊」的三个「嫌疑犯」</p>
<p>可是有誰不承認我門是『猪仔』呢？隔一年，我在那兒愛起議个少女來，她　好繪　，常來叫我幫她拿了盡具到伯牙台去，到洪山公園或東湖的邊去，繪她所喜欲的景色；而我愛讀歌德的詩，便也梜上一本集子在山嶺，消磨它半天。</p>
<p>然而我也曾徘徊于江漢路與中山路的十字街頭；也曾在江漢關的階前聽過　遠的對岸，那密接的幾家紗廠汽笛的吼嘶。我又記得，在饑餓里的一個深秋底黄昏，跟那個少女離別時，流過的熱淚。可是又有誰同情這離別</p>
<p>此後——前年十二月的風暴，我從淪陷了的上海，像老鼠般的穿出封鎖線，穿過三大鐵路，偶然地又踏上了武漢的腔瞠。但是僅僅幾个鐘頭里，使我依舊感釗昏暗和窒息，心里老是起像有人在鞭　我去，這里依舊需要你！』似地，逼着我拔脚出發，一段一設計數着　漢鐵路底長度而走開了。腦海里重印上一个武漢的鳥瞰——跟從前差不離兒的景像，人們依然保持着僞飾的安閒。</p>
<p>又是一年，是自已正恨死廣州莫名其妙失陷時，又雷　似的聽到大武漢的燬滅，使我怎也擺脫不開這想像里的武漢三鎮底雄姿，和百多萬　熟了口音的湖化人。啊！</p>
<p>武漢，這里我敬以赤心一顆，托南風寄在你底靈前，算你的朋友給你一個遠方慰問吧。</p>
<p>在大埔回歸道上，又遇見呆立着的『粵漢鐵路』的車輛，它像哭喪似的哀訴我；洛伽山上巍娥的武漢大學燬滅了！壯麗的黃鶴樓××××××，漢陽兵工廠，大冶鐵廠，一切都焚燬了！這比八年前的水患要慘過幾千百倍的異族底刦難呵！可是武漢，別悲哀，你當年那些粗魯的靑年朋友們，巳在結羣理回來，比刻，你正如我五年前給×人摧殘了的命運議樣，但我畢竟沒有死，還雄健地活在這里工作。那未我們終得有重逢的一天。</p>
<h3>粗野的鐵掌</h3>
<p>— 何程江</p>
<p>別輕視這對粗野的鐵掌！</p>
<p>唯有粗野的鐵掌，</p>
<p>才有鋼鉄的力量。</p>
<p>他能够拿起犂耙種田，</p>
<p>半產了很多食糧！</p>
<p>他能够拿起斧頭伐木，</p>
<p>造起許多的房屋！</p>
<p>他能拿起木　，</p>
<p>把舟搖過狂風駭浪的海洋。……</p>
<p>粗野的跌掌，粗野的鐵掌！</p>
<p>在爲抗戰的喚召握緊了槍。</p>
<p>二方面也未拋棄他的</p>
<p>犂耙，斧頭，木槳……</p>
<p>應幹那樣時他便拿起那樣、</p>
<p>誰要剝奪他底自由把他鎖上？</p>
<p>他便打死誰！不留情！</p>
<p>他要生產，他要建設，他要保衛家鄉！</p>
<p>啊！挺偉大呀！粗野的鐵掌！</p>
<h3>人獸之間</h3>
<p>— 春風</p>
<p>潛室剳記卷上有云：</p>
<p>「梁溪先生曰，財色二子，一落脚便是禽獸。」</p>
<p>人與禽獸之別，似乎所離不遠，正如西洋人的諺　說，天堂的鬥外，就是地獄一樣。至於何以向着財色二宇一落脚便就禽獸呢，原因是沒有說出，在梅峯語錄卷上又有云。。</p>
<p>「循理則進於聖賢，縱欲則進于禽獸</p>
<p>似乎稍微說出何以向財色二字一落脚，便是禽獸的道理來。自然財色就是慾，爲了「慾」的滿足，也就顧不得甚麽個人，民族和國家，同時祖宗可以不認，同胞可以出賣，這不就成功了禽獸麽？</p>
<p>不過對於彼輩利慾黨心的人們，判爲禽獸，他們也是口口聲聲不承認的，就如他們的聲辯說：『我們是忠心救國的，態度正大……』，同時在反面說：『某某先生在河內，從沒有行動呵！』言詞似很中聽，可是行動又如何？最近某主和者不是又從河內移早到暹羅了麽？暹羅同日本的關係是舉世皆知的，在暹羅同土肥原之類的神秘人物討價還價，大概不會再遭到什麽打擊了，何况暹羅之外還有東京呢？不過假使彼輩公開地跑到東京！他們也依然拒絕主和之名。嘴這個東西就是如此的奇妙多端麽。古猶太王所羅門曾寫有一卷名字叫箴言的　，有議章這樣寫着說：</p>
<p>『我所測不透奇妙有三樣，連我所不知道的共有四樣，就是鷹在空中飛的道，蛇在磬石下爬埠道，船在海中行的過，男與女交合的道，淫婦的道也是這樣，她吃了把嘴一擦，就說我沒有行惡｛』</p>
<p>其實所　門這個大智者今日有知，也當加上議類禽獸之道，作爲不理解的　，彼輩强辯的與，也確可和其餘的四者並死。</p>
<p>在一卷七和一卷八期的國訊有議段字，是十分值得讀的，題目是『記李宗仁的一席談』，中有一處論到主和之輩的話說：</p>
<p>『主和論者，恐怕都是言不由衷……無如有二種原因，使他們肝　別具，作出一些詭論來欺天下。第一種原因是他們多半是斯文人，經不起戰爭的恐怖，飛機多在頭上轉幾道，不由得便要着慌起來……第二他們都是投機份子，總想有所憑藉，可以出人頭地。……主和之言，祗是戲法『，骨子里是政治在作祟。』</p>
<p>這段文字，頗可和前人的『縱慾則入於禽獸』的意見相發明。李宗仁先生是武人但武人的見解却比文士更爲透澈。</p>
<h3>評「戰時日本」第六期　（續）</h3>

<h3>Higher Education Reform Issues</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Zexuan</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago, I published an opinion on "Higher Education Revolution," believing that future universities should be divided into three parts: (1) "Continuing Original Training," (2) "Cultivating Construction Talents for Reorganizing the Interior," and (3) "Cultivating Specialized Talents for Emigration and Borderland Colonization." Since the War of Resistance, I have felt even more that it is necessary to implement this kind of differentiated system. The reason why I advocate adding the (2) and (3) sections of work in universities can be discussed from both theoretical and factual aspects. In terms of theory, I believe that: (1) Chinese education must have a way out for the Chinese nation in order to have a way out; (2) the Chinese nation's way out, in the positive aspect, currently has two main avenues: first, reorganizing the interior to stabilize people's lives and discover the advantages of (inherent) culture; second, developing the frontier to establish a new life for the old culture; (3) the Chinese nation's way out, in the negative aspect, must also take into account two points at present: first, strive for time and energy, especially economy in expenditures, to support the precarious situation; second, encourage national self-confidence and self-reliance to create a psychological foundation for revival; (4) for the sake of reorganizing the interior, what we need most is the training of rural construction leading talents, while the general public should receive broad public education; (5) for the sake of developing the frontier, government capitalists must cooperate with experts and apply scientific knowledge and skills, working from experimentation to promotion, and when promoting, special training must be given to immigrants; (6) in order to strive for economic efficiency, government and social leaders must advocate a frugal life and prevent all waste, and all education must focus on thrift; (7) in order to establish national self-confidence and self-reliance, we should promote the inherent virtues of the Chinese nation, disseminate great achievements and figures in history, and promote domestic goods at any time and place. These words seem even more pressing today, twenty months into the War of Resistance. From a factual perspective, we know that before the War of Resistance, higher education institutions that wanted to work on reorganizing the interior included Henan Rural Governance Institute, Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, Hebei County Administration Construction Research Institute, Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, Sichuan Provincial College of Education, and the Rural Administration Practice Institute jointly established by the five universities of North China in Jining, Shandong; higher education institutions that wanted to work on developing the frontier included the branch schools established by the Central Political School in various border areas. After inspecting education in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, I suggested enriching Gansu College to become a center for studying border culture and experimenting with border education. In fact, emigration overseas is also an important part of this work and is one of the original intentions of the founding of National Jinan University.</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, due to the expansion of the war zone, many public and private universities moved from the coastal provinces to the interior and remote provinces. Although some were left in foreign concessions, unfortunately, these moves and retentions were mostly decided temporarily and rarely planned in advance, resulting in some provinces having numerous higher education institutions, with no division of labor or cooperation plan at all. As for the places that needed higher education, there were no such institutions and no universities moved there, resulting in the establishment of a provincial temporary university in Zhejiang. The higher education institutions that previously focused on reorganizing the interior were unfortunately all in the war zone, so they were mostly forced to stop working. Only Jiangsu Provincial College of Education has moved to Yu, Guangxi, and the Rural Administration Practice Institute jointly run by the five universities has moved to Dingfan, Guizhou, and renamed Rural Administration College. I believe that it is best to establish one such institution in each province, or to reorganize existing higher education institutions. Of course, the work of reorganizing the interior must be carried out in close cooperation with the local government. The professors needed by such institutions should be mainly experts in various fields of social sciences. After giving students basic training in the first year, the training should focus on the urgent problems in the interior, rather than grouping them according to traditional academic departments. The training should focus more on dealing with people, and "learning from doing, teaching from doing, teachers and students jointly solving problems, exploring issues, and exchanging experiences from various places for reference."</p>
<p>The higher education institutions that previously focused on borderland development were originally few, but since the War of Resistance, the need for such institutions has become more urgent. I believe that at least three or four centers should be selected in the Northwest, Southwest, and coastal areas to concentrate manpower and financial resources to establish three or four higher education institutions to assist the development of borderland and overseas undertakings. In the Northwest and Southwest, the application of natural sciences should be the main focus of the curriculum. After giving students basic training in the first year, they should be grouped for training in departments such as reclamation, water conservancy, transportation, heavy industry, light industry, mining, medicine, and health. In social sciences, emphasis should be placed on exploring the cultures of various ethnic groups other than the Han Chinese. In the coastal areas, the application of social sciences should be the main focus of the curriculum. After giving students basic training in the first year, the training should focus on the development of education, finance, industry, commerce, enterprise management, factories, transportation, and other sectors overseas, and the study of cultures in various overseas regions should be a common compulsory subject. Emigration work is not easy, and small-scale trial plantings should be carried out first, gradually expanding, and the problems encountered should be jointly studied and solved by teachers, students, and immigrants.</p>
<p>Higher education institutions that have moved out of the war zone, or were originally in non-war zones, and have not suffered major losses, should continue their original work, cultivating academic and specialized talents. How to divide labor and cooperate in order to save money and achieve greater results is also worth overall planning. If the entire redistribution is done in this way, or if there are too many existing professors, the government should fund them to go abroad for lectures or services. As far as I know, overseas Chinese are very willing to bear part of the travel expenses and welcome scholars who are familiar with the situation in the motherland to give systematic academic lectures, and at the same time, they may help to study the development methods of overseas undertakings. The central government may wish to imitate the service groups of primary and secondary school teachers and organize university professor service groups to serve overseas. If all these things can be done, it will not only help the current War of Resistance but also benefit the future national revival.</p>
<h3>World Trends in a Week</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From March 26th to April 1st</p>
<p>The heart-pounding month of March has passed in extreme tension, severity, and crisis. The aggressors and the invaded, who would not want to catch their breath and rest? However, serious problems are still closely pursuing us; first, the unity movement of democratic and peace-loving countries has already made some headway, but it is not strong enough to deal a fatal blow to the aggressors. Second, the aggressor countries, Germany in Eastern and Northeastern Europe, Italy in Spain, and even Japan in Nanchang, have all gained something and are also exhausted and want to rest for a while; however, the Soviet Union's peace policy has achieved great success, and the democratic peace front has become more consolidated and expanded. On the contrary, the contradictions within the aggressor camp have reached the point where they cannot be concealed, and they cannot but continue to take the offensive! Finally, when it comes to our China, the internal and external situations have become increasingly better, and the wars in the Gan River and West River have also turned from danger to safety. However, the Japanese conspiracies are endless, and the activities of the traitors have become even more intensified. Our progress is still far from enough, and the national crisis is still extremely serious. This requires each of us who does not want to be a slave to be vigilant and self-motivated.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Democratic Peace Front</p>
<p>Under the threat of the escalating challenges of the fascist aggressor countries Germany, Italy, and Japan, under the sincere and difficult words of the socialist country the Soviet Union, and under the arduous struggles of the vast number of working people and people of peace and justice in various countries, democratic and peace-loving countries such as Britain, France, and the United States have finally begun to take further measures of unity and cooperation. This week, the situation of consolidating and expanding the democratic peace front has become even clearer. Of particular importance is the progress of the British-Soviet negotiations. British Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson had his first four-hour talk with Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Mikoyan on March 24. Hudson said that the talk "was harmonious and of political importance." On the 25th, the British pro-German newspaper, "Daily Mail," reported that "the Soviet Union requested that Britain and the Soviet Union must take joint military action." On the 27th, the Hong Kong "Smedley's Four Newspapers" claimed that in British-Soviet military cooperation, the Soviet side suggested that it could freely use Vladivostok and Kamchatka during wartime, while the British side would take the route through Canada to aid the Soviet Union. On the 27th, Moscow announced that "the British-Soviet trade negotiations have established a foundation and will continue in London. As for international issues, the exchange of views has resulted in the establishment of personal contacts to seek mutual cooperation on international events." The establishment of friendly cooperative relations between Britain and the Soviet Union is not only, as the French political circles believe, "enough to maintain European peace," but also enough to contribute to world peace. This is the foundation for consolidating and expanding the democratic peace line. The smooth progress of the British-Soviet negotiations was followed by the success of the British-Polish negotiations. Poland announced that it would never allow itself to be succumbed to Germany, and stepped up its preparations for war. British Prime Minister Chamberlain also stated in the House of Commons on the 31st that "Britain is determined to assist Poland and cooperate in resisting any aggression!" Following closely is the closer cooperation between Britain and France! The two countries are now actively conducting military alliance negotiations. The British military delegation has arrived in France, and French Air Minister La Chambre will also go to Britain. French Prime Minister Daladier's speech on the 29th resolutely rejected Italy's demands. As for the joint anti-aggression declaration issued by the two countries, it is even less of a problem. Finally, although there is no significant progress in British-American relations, judging from the decision on the British King's visit to the United States and the brewing of British-American economic sanctions against Germany, the situation is still optimistic. On the American side, while burying themselves in war preparations, they have temporarily shelved the discussion of neutrality law, clearly expressing their support for democratic countries. All these facts have expanded. However, we must also know at the same time that the transformation of British and French policies is not persistent and thorough enough, and there is even the intention of using empty threats against the aggressors and using progressive policies to ease the anti-opposition wave in the country. The French president will soon be re-elected, and the British cabinet reshuffle plan has also been put forward by Eden and others. We must now intensify the unification and development of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movements of the people of Britain and France, promote the collective security system, and further guarantee the victory of the democratic peace front in order to thoroughly sweep away the dark spirits of the war.</p>
<p>Exposing the Cracks in the Aggressor Group</p>
<p>The new success of the Soviet Union's peace policy, the tendency to consolidate and expand the democratic peace front, and the surging anti-fascist and anti-aggression wave among the people of various countries have made the fascist aggressors begin to panic! It has exposed the cracks in the fascist aggressor group! What is attracting attention first is the intensification of the German-Italian contradictions: because the direction of the German aggression has threatened the sphere of influence and the aggression targets of Italy, Hungary and Yugoslavia, causing the uneasiness of the Italian country. And Italy launched Hungary to compete for the Little Russia area of Czechoslovakia, and was counterattacked by the German-commanded Slavic army, which caused even greater anger to the Italian side. Unexpectedly, the exposure of Germany's plan to obtain the Yugoslav market made Italy even more feel the threat of Germany, and had to seek countermeasures. The news of the cracks in the "German-Italian axis" came out. The second is the intensification of the German-Japanese contradictions. The Associated Press Shanghai telegram on the 1st stated: The German-Japanese relations have recently been broken, the reasons are: (1) China recently signed a barter trade agreement with Germany worth 10 million yuan, (2) Japan dare not participate in the military alliance of the anti-communist axis, (3) China recently suddenly imported a huge amount of goods and munitions from Germany. Made the Japanese aggressors talk about disrupting the spirit of the anti-communist agreement.</p>
<p>Originally, the front line of the aggressor countries is a collusion of interests, and "anti-communism" is a kind of cover for this ××× collusion. With the development of aggressive labor, the contradictions between them must also develop accordingly. The final infighting is inevitable. Moreover, the Italian-German collusion is actually only Italy, led by Mussolini, waving the flag for Hitler's conscription, and has only suffered humiliation and has little benefit. Similarly, in the German-Japanese collusion, Japan has no way to obtain any practical help from Germany, and Germany also has the distress of sacrificing its original rights and interests in China. This is the congenital deficiency of the aggressive group. Disintegration is not a strange thing, but is inevitable.</p>
<p>However, if we conclude today that the aggressive group has begun to collapse, then it is not only "not yet the time," but it is very likely that the aggressors will "smile sinisterly"! First of all, let's talk about Italian-German relations. Italy's alliance with Germany is indeed a great loss, but if Mussolini's aggressive policy does not go bankrupt one day, then the Italian-German axis must still exist one day. Because Mussolini wants to protect his stolen goods in Abyssinia and Spain, and "not to be a prisoner of the Mediterranean" but to "establish a great Roman Empire," he must rely on Germany to help him attack Britain and France in order to realize these attempts. In Mussolini's speech on March 26, although he had revealed his anxiety about Germany's attitude, he had to try his best to use "moderate" tones. However, it is better to say that he is eager to ask for Germany's assistance than to say that he is willing to abandon the axis! Goering will visit Mussolini soon. Let's look at the facts in the future! Secondly, the German-Japanese alliance is indeed opposed by the majority of the Japanese population, and the interests of Germany and Japan are also conflicting. However, the Japanese aggressors know the wonderfulness of "distant friendship and close attack," and without the banner of "anti-communism," the war against China will lose its excuse, and the military and civilian morale will not be said, and the ugly state of the camp will be fully exposed, and it will not be avoided from the total collapse! So when we talk about this, we have to pay attention to:</p>
<p>The Japanese are hatching new conspiracies</p>
<p>The longer the Japanese military aggression against China lasts, the more uncertain the future is, and the more the tendency of collapse in the country and even in the army develops. This is what the Japanese authorities clearly know! Therefore, on the one hand, they attempt to eliminate the main force of China's resistance, blockade and cut off China's foreign aid with the highest degree of exertion of combat power, so as to quickly subdue China and quickly end the war. However, this kind of attempt has little hope because of the improvement of China's internal and external situation, so they cannot but carry out their poisonous tricks of "anti-communism," "peace," "mediation," etc. to induce surrender at any time. Although the German ambassador Trautmann's conspiracy and the tragic failure of Wang Jingwei's conspiracy, the Japanese are still trying their best to realize it.</p>
<p>Recently, the British ambassadors to Japan and China met in Shanghai to discuss issues such as protecting the Shanghai concessions and the British political and economic interests in China that have been destroyed by Japan. The Associated Press Chongqing telegram on the 29th stated that the two ambassadors will also discuss the current situation in China and Japan and mediate the problem. The Japanese took the opportunity to spread rumors of their mediation and compromise. Following this, there was news that the Sino-German business relationship had improved and that a 10 million yuan trade agreement had been reached. The Associated Press Shanghai telegram on the 29th reported: "Since the Sino-German relationship has progressed, Germany may act as a mediator to mediate the Sino-Japanese war." The Japanese poisonous trick of inducing surrender is even more rampant. On April 1, it was reported that Wang Jingwei immediately published an article catering to the Japanese intentions, advocating what "international mediation and direct negotiations should be carried out simultaneously, so that I can assist from the sidelines in the status of an opposition party." The Japanese black screen of desperately seeking peace but still trying to induce surrender has been partially revealed!</p>
<p>As yesterday's editorial in this newspaper has clearly stated, the purpose of this total performance of the Japanese traitors is "to weaken the prestige of our government among the people and in the international community, to provoke and alienate our domestic unity and international relations, and to undermine the cooperation of democratic and peace-loving countries"! The Japanese spreading rumors, secretly using poisonous tricks, and the traitors deliberately catering to and fueling the flames, are only destroying China's anti-Japanese national united front. They are only stopping China's national resistance and construction undertakings, and the ultimate goal is to realize the inducement to surrender, realize the conquest of China, and then dominate the Pacific.</p>
<p>However, this conspiracy and poisonous trick of the Japanese traitors, as well as any attempt in the international community to rehearse a new Munich farce, will be finally shattered under the increasingly strong united front of the anti-Japanese and nation-building of all parties, all classes, and all ethnic minorities in China! They will be finally shattered under the great power of China's resistance, which has the only highest leader, the leadership of the revolutionary party, the dynamic power on the vast territory, and the support of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, and the justice of the working masses all over the world! The Associated Press Shanghai telegram on the 31st was right: "China's national power, whether political, diplomatic, financial, or economic, is showing rapid progress. China will never reconcile halfway!" Today, the Chinese people must closely monitor the Japanese conspiracy and prepare to give it a thorough blow. The main thing is to promote greater progress in politics: the chain of progress of resistance, democracy, and mobilization.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Anti-Japanese War in a Week</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say that the reason why the Japanese traitors have recently launched another round of conspiracies and poisonous tricks of "anti-communism," "peace," "compromise," "mediation," etc. to induce surrender is due to China's recent military setbacks. In fact, as a result of the fighting this week, Nanchang, the only large city left in southeastern China, has also fallen, and there have been reports of the fall of Jiangmen in southern Guangdong twice. China has suffered considerable losses. But do we not see Japan's losses? Do we not look at the entire war situation? Do we arbitrarily say "China has failed" and "Japan has won again"? No, this is a big mistake and a great sin!</p>
<p>The Japanese attack on Nanchang is based on the entire plan. We have already emphasized it several weeks ago. However, we must also understand: (1) Judging from the purpose of the Japanese attack on Nanchang, it is still passive, attempting to boost its increasingly exhausted morale on the one hand, and attempting to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and threaten the Yuehan Railway to strengthen its rule in the occupied areas of China and facilitate attacks on the guerrillas on the other hand; (2) Judging from the strategy of the Japanese attack on Nanchang, it is still in a passive situation due to the passivity of its purpose. It cannot and dare not break through our main force; on the other hand, it is forced to only fight for cities and transportation lines, leaving space everywhere on the wings and the flanks, and the connection and supply are completely inconsistent. Therefore, the Japanese cross the Xiu River, and our Lushan area guerrillas have cut off its rear. The Japanese cross the Gan River, and Anyi, Fengxin, and other places have been recovered one after another; (3) Judging from the advantages and disadvantages of the fall of Nanchang, Nanchang is the protruding point of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and it is in a disadvantageous strategic situation. Now that we have withdrawn from Nanchang, we will wait for the opportunity to counterattack the Japanese. Until now, the Japanese still dare not go south. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is still connected in a straight line south of Nanchang, and has not actually been cut off. On the contrary, the Japanese occupied Nanchang and suffered heavy losses due to the elite troops left in the city to fight street battles, and the 4th Division of the Japanese army that attacked Nanchang suffered 15,000 casualties after a week of fierce fighting. (The Associated Press Shanghai telegram on the 30th stated that the Japanese have suffered 30,000 casualties in northern Jiangxi in the past week.) In the Wuning line of war, the Japanese also suffered 4,000 casualties! (4) In this battle, we have proved the success of the mobile strategy, realized the close cooperation of the air and land forces, and completed the plan to annihilate a large number of the Japanese main force. Now, our anti-offensive has been launched in the Jiangxi-Hubei-Hunan border, northern Jiangxi, Lushan, and southern Anhui, and the main force of the Japanese army in central China will suffer greater punishment without a doubt.</p>
<p>Secondly, the war in South China is also tense. The Japanese army captured Rongqi and Guizhou in succession, and broke into Jiangmen and Zhongshan Shiqi twice; it was shaken. The momentum of the Japanese army seemed to be very daunting. However, from a strategic point of view, the Japanese army's operation this time is also passive, attempting to consolidate its occupation in Guangzhou in order to actively develop its "mopping up" guerrilla warfare and consolidate its rear when it attacks the southwest in the future. Its purpose is similar to that of attacking and capturing Nanchang. Now that our large army has reinforced, the situation has calmed down. However, the Japanese attach more importance to the strategy of attacking the southwest than to the central China. In the future, they will also attempt to use the battle of attacking Jiangmen, etc., to attract and attack our main force, and then take the route through Beihai, violently invade the southern route, and spy on Nanning. At the same time, they will use the Japanese forces in the northwest and other two lines to divide and attack Wuzhou and Guilin to disperse our military strength. The Japanese have long recognized the southwest as our main base for resistance and the main international passage. In addition, the international background is easier to deal with than the northwest, the Japanese naval, land, and air force connection is also easier, the marching distance is shorter, and the Han people and pro-Japanese elements are intensifying their activities. This is what we must pay close attention to and guard against.</p>
<p>Finally, the war situation in East China and North China has not changed significantly recently. Due to the stimulation of the Japanese attack on Nanchang, large-scale guerrilla warfare in various places in East China has been actively prepared. In North China, General Zhu De has taken up the concurrent post of Deputy Commander of a certain war zone on the 27th, and on the 29th, he will do his best to consolidate the anti-Japanese base behind the enemy and fight the Japanese imperialism to the end to establish a new China of the Three People's Principles. At the same time, the telegram of the great victory in southern Jin was also found in the Hong Kong newspapers yesterday. The Japanese side has rumored that our army will launch a large-scale counter-offensive against North China. Although this is from the Japanese newspapers, developing guerrilla warfare behind the enemy is indeed our most important and urgent task at present to "stop the Japanese offensive and strive for the final victory." We are looking forward to even greater victories.</p>
<p>(The "End of the War" in Spain has been temporarily removed due to space limitations.)</p>
<h3>Dr. Baker Talks About His Impressions of Inspecting North China</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] This city's foreign news, Dr. Baker, General Secretary of the China Foreign Relief Association Disaster Relief Association, returned to Shanghai on the 20th after a three-week inspection of North China, and told reporters that although the flood situation in North China this year is not as serious as in previous years, most of the people in the area still need to be relieved. Although the winter harvest is abundant, the income of farmers has decreased, because only the Japanese army buys cotton, and what the Japanese army pays is only one-third of the cotton price. At present, the Japanese army and bandits in North China are all over the place, so it is a difficult task to relieve the farmers. It is no longer safe for those who carry money into the countryside, and valuable items will almost certainly be looted by bandits. The stagnation of commerce in the small counties also makes this task difficult. Since it is not possible to carry money to various counties, or because of the lack of convenient banks in these areas, it is impossible to remit money. Dr. Baker also said that when he was in North China, the Japanese implemented new currency methods, the purpose of which was to harm the value of Chinese legal tender. However, this move has been a complete failure since its implementation. Not only has it failed to stop the circulation of legal tender, but it has also helped to increase the premium of legal tender, which has already been upgraded. The method advocated by the Japanese side aims to prohibit the public from circulating legal tender. In name, anyone who is found carrying a paper of one jiao of legal tender will be sentenced to 10,000 yuan. However, if the "Joint Banknote" is found on the person by the guerrillas, he will be sentenced to death. The business of foreign merchants is indeed at a standstill. Foreigners now understand that all businesses will eventually be controlled by the Japanese. Now foreign merchants are waiting for development. Regarding the Japanese monopoly on wool, Dr. Baker believes that this move will inevitably fail. Shops that weave carpets are now unable to buy wool in the market. The method of transportation has improved slightly recently, but the train only runs during the day and still stops at night. The guerrillas still attack the railway station. Along this line, strong fortresses can be seen. The important locations along the transportation line are now guarded by the Japanese army and members of the Red Spear Society. Dr. Baker also criticized the public morale, saying that few people with smiling faces are seen, and no one is seen riding a horse on the street, which may indicate that they have not yet forgotten their worries. Many houses are being built in Peiping, most of which are owned by the Japanese. Rents have increased sharply, but salaries have also increased. Military trucks are often seen in rows on the streets of Peiping, speeding past, causing traffic congestion. Several Japanese geishas now live in Peiping, and Japanese merchants are also increasing sharply.</p>
<h3>A Year in Review and Future Prospects for Yulin Culture</h3>
<p>(Reading yesterday's news)</p>
<p>The Journalists Association has publicly recommended Mr. Li Sheng Lun (special correspondent for the "Sweeping Away" newspaper) as the director of the preparatory office, which includes a wartime operations department. This department is further divided into communication, service, and editing groups.</p>
<p>The Northwest War Zone Cultural Work Troupe is entirely a war zone service organization, structured as follows:</p>
<p>General Affairs Group.</p>
<p>Northwest War Zone Cultural Work Troupe Publication Group – War Reports, Series, Comics.</p>
<p>War Work Group – Frontline Theater, Choral Singing.</p>
<p>The work of this troupe is underway, and it will bear the arduous cultural task of defending the Great Northwest in battle.</p>
<p>Finally, we must mention the many exiled youths who love their country and fight for it with bloodshed. Coming from all over, they arrived in northern Shaanxi and, in cooperation with local youth, formed anti-Japanese propaganda teams. Under the leadership of the 21st Army Corps, they began their sacred and great work in March 1938.</p>
<p>This anti-Japanese propaganda team was led by Mr. Ba Zhiguo, a student from Northeastern University. They wrote many excellent plays as propaganda material for rural areas. Their popular pamphlets and heroic songs awakened millions of people. In the midst of the mass movement, they trained over a hundred young cadres who were dispersed to schools and units, playing a promotional role. Fresh slogans and comics were posted throughout the streets, and mournful, resolute songs filled the ancient Yulin city. Their figures were present in many mass meetings and routine gatherings, giving impassioned speeches. It is worth noting that they established a short-term Japanese language training class, where each team member learned thirty to forty everyday Japanese phrases for use on the front lines. Their efforts to educate the masses and soldiers also yielded excellent results.</p>
<p>Yulin was once invaded by the Japanese. To serve the wounded officers and soldiers at the time, the anti-Japanese propaganda team established a wounded soldier慰问隊 in Yulin, soliciting books and newspapers from various Yulin agencies for distribution to the wounded soldiers for reading. They regularly sent staff to write letters home, read books and newspapers, sing songs, tell stories, and wash clothes... They comforted the wounded soldiers and encouraged their courage to return to the front lines.</p>
<p>Due to the influence and encouragement of the anti-Japanese propaganda team, the schools automatically established a summer rural service corps. Energetic and healthy high school students enthusiastically participated, enriching the organization. They quickly set off for the countryside and the front lines, living alongside soldiers and farmers. They fulfilled their responsibilities for propaganda and organization, greatly promoting military-civilian cooperation.</p>
<p>Following the rural service corps came the establishment of a frontline war zone service corps and the Great Era Theater Troupe, jointly organized by three graduating schools. Subsequently, the middle school students' "Aspiring Youth Society" and the county-led "Youth Anti-Japanese Pioneer Corps" were also formed. All these groups surrounded tens of thousands of people and fulfilled the missions given to them by the era, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Here, we want to introduce the Mongolian-Tibetan Art Propaganda Team. It was led by young artists from China, such as Zhang, Tao, Jinye, and Feng. This was a propaganda organization under the command of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Guidance Office, targeting Mongolia. These young people possessed artistic and writing talents. They performed countless plays in this area and published a Mongolian propaganda painting collection and a Mongolian song collection. Undoubtedly, these were all expressions of promoting Mongolian work further.</p>
<p>In the flames of war during the year of resistance, the cultural workers of Yulin made people feel excited and invigorated in the ancient city on the frontier. They did their due diligence for the country and the nation. However, it is undeniable that the depth and breadth of their work were still insufficient. We believe:</p>
<p>(1) The mass movement today should be actively launched and advanced in coordination with the situation of the War of Resistance and should serve the War of Resistance at all times in accordance with the times.</p>
<p>(2) The cultural movement mainly educates the masses and raises the national consciousness of the people through the masses, so that everyone can go to the forefront of the War of Resistance. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent for the cultural movement to penetrate into the countryside.</p>
<p>(3) Cultural workers should use their sharp weapons to forcefully stab the military-fascist Japanese bandits and exert their due effect.</p>
<p>The sacred War of Resistance of the Chinese nation has entered a more difficult second stage. Defending the Great Northwest has become a difficult task for every one of the 450 million compatriots. Cultural workers should overcome their own weaknesses and the objective situation no longer allows their weaknesses to exist.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the future prospects of Yulin's cultural workers, I would like to leave the following message:</p>
<p>Cultural workers need and urgently demand that they work hard in the face of difficulties, and bear the responsibilities they should and will bear in the raging tide of war on the frontier ancient city. In other words, the future is bright!</p>

<h3>Battle for Jiangmen; Thousands of Japanese Troops Killed in Four Days of Bloody Fighting; Rumor of Temporary Retreat Yesterday Awaiting Opportunity for Counterattack</h3>
<p>(Quick Report from Shiqi) The battle for Jiangmen, which began on the 29th, was fiercely resisted by our brave forces. As of the morning of yesterday, the 1st, the Japanese temporarily retreated after suffering over a thousand casualties. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Continue to Attack</p>
<p>On the 29th and 30th, after suffering heavy blows from our forces at Tangxia and Beilu, the Japanese troops realized their weakness and transferred Japanese troops from Daliang, Jiujiang, Ronggui, and other places to provide reinforcements. On the morning of the 31st, over 20 Japanese boats carrying two to three hundred soldiers landed at Zhutou Mountain and advanced towards Beijie. At the same time, over a thousand Japanese troops advanced from the Jiang-Fo Road towards Shaping, attempting to attack Jiangmen from multiple directions. Over 20 Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombed various locations, including Jiangmen, Huicheng, and Beijie, from morning to dusk on the 31st to support the Japanese troops' advance. To date, the number of Japanese troops in Xinhui has increased to two to three thousand.</p>
<p>Hitting Our Landmines</p>
<p>On the 31st, the Japanese troops who landed at Zhutou Mountain advanced to the Wanhualou near the East Fort when they triggered our pre-buried landmines, causing an immediate explosion. Japanese soldiers fell to the ground in droves, with over a hundred Japanese soldiers killed or wounded. The Japanese troops continued to rush fiercely towards Jiangmen. At the same time, Japanese warships on the Tianhe Sea fired intensively at Beijie, with shells raining down. Our army fought bravely, but due to the intense artillery fire, all coastal defenses were destroyed by 10:00 AM, forcing them to retreat. Beijie was again occupied by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Fighting for Jiangmen</p>
<p>After Beijie fell again, a Japanese unit rushed towards Jiangmen along the Jiangbei Highway, heading directly for the city. Our forces engaged the Japanese in street fighting, charging and killing each other, and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Our forces retreated and advanced repeatedly, annihilating over half of the attacking Japanese troops. By 6:00 PM, the Japanese troops again rushed in from the Jiaotou area, and our forces began to shift their positions, but continued to fight the Japanese on Dixi Road and Changan Road. It is estimated that our forces engaged in mixed warfare in Jiangmen City for several hours, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers. Our army also suffered some casualties. According to the latest intelligence, our army withdrew from Jiangmen because the outer defense positions had fallen into the hands of the Japanese and had obtained a price from the Japanese, but they are still holding on in the mountains, maintaining a stalemate with the Japanese. Our reinforcements have arrived and are annihilating the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Landing in Fangcheng Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yingde, 31st] At noon on the 29th, three Japanese warships suddenly used machine guns and cannons to cover motorboats at Qisha in southern Fangcheng, attempting to land near Qisha. After our defending army fought bravely, sinking several Japanese boats in over an hour of fierce fighting, the Japanese fled back to the warships.</p>
<h3>Spring Festival Held in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 1st] Over 300 soldiers here held a spring festival ceremony at the Guandi Temple in this city at 3:00 AM today. The ceremony was presided over by Garrison Commander Liu Zhi, in accordance with ancient rites, with Chinese and Western music played together. All participants bowed in salute until dawn. It is also reported that other major cities are also holding this spring festival.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Forcibly Occupy Storm Island, Causing Serious Repercussions in France; U.S. Authorities Also Take It Very Seriously</h3>
<p>Reporter Reveals That Japanese Forces Notified France</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 1st] After it was reported that the Japanese had occupied the Four Sands Islands, our reporter interviewed people in diplomatic circles. According to them, what the Japanese occupied was actually Storm Island (also known as Spratly Island) in the Tuan Sha Islands, not the Xisha Islands. It is located between French Indochina and the Philippine Tubbataha Reef. It originally belonged to our country but was occupied by France. This rash, forcible occupation will inevitably cause repercussions in France and the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] The Japanese forcible occupation of Storm Island has caused, to say the least, great shock here. The French side believes that this island is actually owned by France and is actually occupied by France. The French government had previously notified all countries about this matter. Previously, the Japanese had raised a dispute with France regarding its ownership here. In the course of discussions, Japan suddenly put forward a note of automatic occupation, its attitude extremely arrogant. However, France and Japan will not constitute a war because of the ratio, and its future destiny will still be determined in the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[Washington, 31st] U.S. Secretary of State Hull said that he attaches great importance to the Japanese automatic occupation of Storm Island near Annam, but he has not yet received formal notification from the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Spy on Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 31st] At around 1:00 PM today, a Japanese aircraft flew over Xinjin and came near Ji'an. It was fired upon by our forces and quickly fled. At around 3:00 PM, another ten Japanese aircraft, six of which flew over Zhangshu and scattered, and four of which flew south, scattered to the suburbs of Xinjin and dropped several bombs before fleeing. Three bombs were dropped in Matou Village in the territory of Jiyong County before fleeing. We suffered no losses. After the Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc, two aircraft again invaded the suburbs of Ji'an, scouted for a while, and fled.</p>
<h3>Three Soldiers of the Shanghai Four Banks Leave Camp</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 1st] Three soldiers of the Shanghai Public Concession's Four Banks isolated army left camp at 7:00 AM yesterday and went elsewhere. The Shanghai police authorities are currently investigating this matter.</p>
<h3>National Government Orders</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st) National Government Order of the 1st:</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Promotes Industrial Cooperatives; Cooperative Associations Establish Offices in Various Locations; Many Large Cooperatives Have Been Organized in Yunnan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 31st] The Executive Yuan initiated the organization of the "Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association" in July of last year and allocated 5 million yuan as a fund. Its main task is to relieve and organize workers to increase production. Currently, the association has established offices in Ganzhou, Shaoyang, Baoji, and Kunming. After the Yunnan office was established in February, it has formed large rattan industry and cast iron industry cooperatives, and will set up offices in outer counties to promote this cooperative business widely.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Pawnshops; Kunming Farmers Bank Orders Loans to Develop</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Kunming, 1st] The Kunming Farmers Bank, following the order of the Ministry, plans to lend one million to develop the pawnshop industry. The Provincial Yunnan Bank has agreed to cooperate.</p>
<h3>Grain Exports; New Measures Enacted in Guangxi Province; To Prevent Unauthorized Transportation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 31st] The Guangxi Provincial Government has formulated two measures to prevent the transportation of large quantities of rice: For amounts of 3,000 jin or more, a certificate from the local government of the rice-purchasing province is required for export. For amounts between 1,000 jin and 3,000 jin, the local county government should investigate and issue a release permit before transportation is allowed.</p>
<h3>Although the Coastline is Blockaded, Foreign Trade is Not Affected; Customs Publishes Annual Report with Detailed Commentary; Imports Have Increased Year by Year for the Past Three Years</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong News] Since our country launched the sacred War of Resistance, the coastline has been blockaded. Although foreign trade is not as convenient as before, it has not had any significant impact. According to the Customs' annual report, the amount of foreign trade in 1938 exceeded that of 1936 before the war by 64.9 million yuan, compared to 164.7 million yuan in 1937, the amount of foreign trade was 179.1 million yuan. The import trade in the past three years has all been progressive, with the following figures: (1936) 23.5 million yuan, (1937) 11.5 million yuan, (1938) 12.3 million yuan. The customs revenue for 1938 was 254,565,469 yuan in national currency, compared to 342,899,739 yuan in the previous year, a reduction of 88,334,270 yuan, or 26 percent. The customs duties in 1937 were 342,899,739 yuan, of which 262,261,262 yuan were the revenue during the period from January to July, which was the pre-war income. In the five months after the outbreak of the war, customs revenue was 254,565,269 yuan. Imports in 1938 decreased from 95.3 million yuan in 1937 to 88.6 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Different Scenes</h3>
<p>— Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>Around the Battles in Central Hubei</p>
<p>After arriving in Jingmen, it rained heavily for four consecutive days. Although the weather had cleared up on the 20th, the roads were still full of mud, so we had to endure another day. At 1:00 PM that afternoon, an air raid alert sounded. As we climbed up the mountainside on the edge of the city, we heard the "嗡嗡嗡" sound. In less than two minutes, we saw nine shining Japanese aircraft flying across the city sky. Everyone thought the Japanese aircraft had gone elsewhere, and emotions returned to normal. Unexpectedly, the Japanese aircraft suddenly turned around, and the "嗡嗡嗡" sound became even louder.</p>
<p>"噓噓" A strange cry resounded in the sky. This strange cry was like a group of evil spirits shouting. Before we could even hear the loud sound, we saw a plume of black smoke rising from south to north in the city, instantly turning the entire city into a sea of smoke. At this time, the beautiful scenery of Jingmen was covered by a murderous aura.</p>
<p>The "嗡嗡" sound grew closer, and again a "噓噓噓" strange cry sounded above our heads and in our ears for a long time, followed by the "碰碰碰" sound. Another plume of black smoke rose in the city, with two places emitting red flames. It was as if the city's blood was spurting out. After the Japanese aircraft passed, there was a commotion on the mountain and below. The people hiding on the mountain, although avoiding the danger, were all concerned about the fate of their houses and hurriedly ran down the mountain.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, the "嗡嗡嗡" sound echoed in the sky again. Immediately, nine more Japanese aircraft flew from the south. Upon reaching the city sky, they divided into three groups, and the "噓噓噓" "碰碰碰" bombs fell like rain. Black, string-like bombs flew down from the sky. Some bloomed in mid-air, with a cluster of flames flying in all directions, while others exploded in the city, with clusters of fire rising one after another. A school founded by Americans, a church with the American flag hanging above it, and the American emblem painted brightly on the tiles could not escape the engulfment of the Japanese bombs.</p>
<p>It was like waking from a nightmare.</p>
<p>An adjutant of the XX Army said that the army was holding a military-civilian entertainment party that night and invited reporters to attend. At the entertainment party, upon hearing the news that Commander-in-Chief XX knew that Jingmen had been bombed, he distributed 1,000 yuan in relief funds to the disaster victims. This made people very excited. Here, we must admire the spirit of the military and civilians of Jingmen. Although they encountered such a severe bombing during the day, the gongs and drums at their entertainment party that night were louder than the Japanese bombs, and the crowds of military and civilians were just like those huddled in an air raid shelter, unable to breathe.</p>
<p>Eight pairs of soldiers, dressed as eight pairs of strangely dressed men and women, danced and sang, with the lamplight and candlelight accompanying their dance steps and the sound of gongs and drums blending with their songs. The reporter himself almost suspected that he was in a grand night dance party on the screen.</p>
<p>The most amusing thing was a boat lantern. There was a boat girl on the surface and a boatman outside. The boatman was using a paddle, and the boat girl inside,忽緩忽急忽進忽退, matched very naturally.</p>
<p>Scene after scene passed, everyone cheering, everyone laughing loudly, covering up the wounds of the day.</p>
<p>Going to the front lines of central Hubei, we encountered the most tense time. On the 28th, Commander-in-Chief XX led several important generals to personally command the battle on the front lines. The reporter happened to meet them on the way, and during a brief conversation, sincerely wished him another "Taierzhuang".</p>
<p>This time, the Japanese offensive in central Hubei was divided into three routes. It goes without saying that the main force was on the highway line (Beijing-Zhongxiang-Hanyi Road), because if the Japanese main force left the highway line, it would no longer be effective and might be eliminated by us; one route was from Jingshan north to attack Sanyangdian; and one route was from Tianmen south to attack Yuekou. The Japanese objective in attacking Sanyangdian was to attract our main force, and then the Japanese would put on a main offensive facade on the Jing-Zhong Road. Although Sanyangdian and Jing-Zhong Road are only 80 or so miles apart, they are all high mountains and steep ridges. If our main force was attracted to that side, it would be impossible to rush back in one day. Knowing the Japanese plan, we never fell for their trick. The Japanese in Yuekou occupied Yuekou on the 27th in order to cover their frontal attack.</p>
<p>During this operation, the XXXX four commanders of the XXX Group Army were all taking the lead, personally visiting the front lines and directing the battle at the risk of their lives. The Japanese used a large amount of poison gas every day during the dozen or so days of fighting in central Hubei. Although our soldiers suffered heavy casualties, the Japanese losses far exceeded ours.</p>
<p>Here, it should be reminded to everyone that although the fighting in central Hubei this time was very fierce, it was not a strategic attack but a tactical advance. If the Japanese had a major strategic intention, they would have to feign an attack on the XX side. At the same time, they were creating a feint on the XX side. The Japanese at the front lines were only a division and a half, and they were all the original defending troops there. In terms of military strength, the Japanese did not have major intentions. The so-called tactical advance was only an attempt to seize nine front-line strongholds.</p>
<p>The tactical battle launched by the Japanese in central Hubei this time was not without reason. First, because our guerrillas were too active in central Hubei, even infiltrating near Wuhan, and often destroying the puppet organizations played by the Japanese, the Japanese妄想拓拓了前綫地位 in order to cover up the ugly drama of their behind-the-scenes direction. Second, because they knew that our troops were becoming stronger day by day, they feared being severely attacked, so they made an offensive to implement the so-called "policy of ensuring the occupied positions on the front lines." Third, because the Japanese wanted to facilitate their joint operations with the ocean in the future, they first seized the riverine outposts along the river, so that they could launch a large-scale campaign after the spring warms up and the water rises.</p>
<p>The Japanese occupied on the 5th of this month, but this has little impact on us, because Zhongxiang is in the east of the river and there is no defensible terrain to defend, and our regular army guerrillas are still fighting the Japanese in the east of the river. The Japanese now have a vertical front line of more than 200 miles in central Hubei, and our troops are on its flanks, and can flank them at any time. The Japanese will definitely have a disastrous defeat if they want to expand forward, and on the XX side, we have a large army watching them, and the Japanese must feel that there are困雞 both in advancing and retreating.

<h3>Changsha's Revival from Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>— Special Air Dispatch from Changsha Zhang Changren</p>
<p>On the highway from Hengyang to Changsha, there are very few military vehicles in operation. At the ferry near Xiangtan, before the great fire of Changsha, there were more than six hundred vehicles waiting to cross south; now, only the one we are in drives onto the north bank. Willows on the roadside, peach blossoms in front of the village, smile at the farmers plowing in spring; the people of eastern Hunan and all over the country are intensifying production to support the war and answer the invaders.</p>
<p>Although the great battle of repairing the Henan and Gan Rivers has begun, the Xiang-E front is still calm.</p>
<p>March in Changsha has revived from the scorched earth. Like the European cities after the Second World War described by Wells in "The Shape of Things to Come," the people after the disaster are rebuilding everything in the ruins. However, it is not so lonely or so desolate, because the great Chinese nation is the most resilient to disasters and the most courageous in creation!</p>
<p>I had witnessed the burning of Changsha, and in just four months, I have seen its new face again. I admire the courage of the people of southern Hunan, who are intensifying the construction of Changsha in the rear, only a hundred kilometers away from the front line.</p>
<p>Changsha, which had more than 60,000 houses and hundreds of thousands of people, was left with only over 10,000 houses and over 30,000 people scattered in the east, south, and north after the fire. Now, new houses are constantly being built in the rubble, and the population has nearly tenfold increased since then, and people returning home are still continuously on the way. Houses made of thatch and wood are only a small part of them, and city houses that pay attention to the façade are gradually increasing. Around Nan Zheng Road, the stores that a metropolis should have are all complete – except for banks and pawnshops.</p>
<p>Gold shops are surprisingly as numerous as tobacco shops. In terms of appearance, they are not as "splendid" as tobacco shops, but in reality, I think they are the hegemon of Changsha's financial world, replacing banks and pawnshops. Many people exchange gold jewelry for cash at these shops, and many houses and shops are built with this exchanged cash one by one. Society is built on an economic foundation. The Changsha office of the Central Bank is about to be established in early April. In the future, Changsha will undoubtedly become stronger and more stable due to financial activities.</p>
<p>The original larger hotels were destroyed, replaced by more than four hundred "grand inns." The largest "Sanhe" has thirty or forty rooms, and the average is from five or six to fourteen or fifteen rooms. The owners of these "grand inns" are mostly fortunate small citizens with a little property. Many shop clerks now have to happily perform the task of "waiters." Almost every household is a store, or at least sets up a stall in front of the door to make a living, and they all look "decent." Even on good weather days, citizens do not think of air raids. The targets of the "flying bandits" under the command of the Japanese army are concentrated peaceful civilians. The more than 200,000 evacuated citizens of Changsha are difficult to satisfy their desire to kill.</p>
<p>The old big stores sell their inventory under the name of temporary stores. The meaning of "temporary" refers to the period before the new stores are completed. New stores often adopt optimistic names for the future as their store names, which gives a glimpse into the general public's feelings about the future of the war of resistance, but there are also inevitably "wavering elements." A restaurant is named "Speculation Hall." I think its owner must be prepared to leave Changsha at any time. Prices are higher than in Hengyang, but much lower than in Guilin, where prices are unreasonably raised. Most of the daily necessities come from Wenzhou, and very few are products of domestic manufacturers. Many brands are unfamiliar, and many trademarks hint at the red of the "sun."</p>
<p>Electricity and telephone services will be restored soon. Agencies and residences that need to use telephones are connected to military telephones. There are three daily newspapers: National Daily (broadsheet), Battlefront Daily (four-page), and People's Daily (small size), and one New Citizen Evening News (eight-page). Recently, various newspapers held charity sales to comfort the soldiers at the front, with some readers purchasing a copy for thirty yuan.</p>
<p>Changsha's night market, although not as good as before, is as bustling as the daytime. Because electricity is still being prepared, a few stores jointly maintain a gasoline street lamp on the bustling streets, one lamp every ten or twenty houses, making the roads brighter than in the past. In remote streets and alleys, residents jointly set up a glass kerosene street lamp every five households. Although it is a bit darker, it is much more convenient for pedestrians. Some poor people often steal oil at night, but they don't steal the lamp, so on some lamps I found humorous ink or white powder words such as "So you're here again!" "If you come to steal lamp oil, you might as well take your wife." The owners of these street lamps mostly laugh it off with the oil thief, because the oil left after a kerosene lamp is lit until late at night is also limited.</p>
<p>Prostitutes are parasites of the military, political, and business communities, especially in these years of war. Women who are born without a place to settle are forced to take this path. The provincial government designated several alleys such as Dadong Mao Lane for registered prostitutes to live in, and green triangle lights are hung in front of the doors at night. However, only 101 are registered, because they are afraid that being too "ostentatious" will affect their business. These alleys used to be the gathering place of Changsha's prominent families, but now I don't know who is in charge. They have been converted into restaurants and hotels. On the passenger list of hotels in this area, more than half write names like "Ms. Chen Yanqiu" or "Ms. Xiao Hongyu," and below it is noted "Long-term stay," which is a very skillful advertising method. Before the lunar new year, it was possible to play cards in the hotels, but now it is forbidden.</p>
<p>After the Changsha Municipal Government was merged with the County Government, the Police Bureau was transferred to the Provincial Government, with a Municipal Affairs Section attached to manage municipal affairs. Conscription, township insurance, relief money, and grain storage have recently been handled by the County Government. In the past, Changsha City was supposed to conscript 200 strong men per month, and Changsha County 1,000. Before and after the fire, the population dispersed, and now they are returning one after another, and re-conscription has begun. Last November and December, there were over a thousand insurance units and about 90,000 strong men in the county that should have been conscripted but were not. Now, over seven hundred insurance units are being handled, with an average of two men being conscripted per insurance unit per month. Up to now, a total of more than 14,000 people have been conscripted. The relief money for those who sacrificed for the country amounts to more than 100,000 yuan per year. However, because the troops are transferred indefinitely and the numbers are often changed, and some middle and senior officers are also transferred or martyred, the families of the conscripted are unable to investigate the survival of the conscripts or obtain proof of death in order to apply for relief. This matter concerns the advantages and disadvantages of the future of conscription, and the situation is the same everywhere, and the authorities seem to urgently need to find a solution. As for food, the losses during the fire were very large, and because the citizens are scattered in the countryside and there are many troops stationed in the county, it is now a slight problem. The provincial and county governments are issuing passports so that people can transport the rice and grain stored in neighboring counties back to regulate the supply.</p>
<p>After the rice was used for public expenses, it has now been transformed into military-civilian cooperation stations. In northern Hunan, there are currently four organized by the Political Department of the ×th War Zone and three organized by the local people. Their main task is to purchase firewood, rice, oil, and salt for the troops passing through, so as to avoid any trouble when the troops directly purchase from the people. Each station also has dozens of voluntary transportation teams, organized by local students and strong men, who carry wounded soldiers from station to station. However, the movement of troops also often requires labor. At first, it was easy for the county government to get dozens or hundreds of people, but later, because some troops did not allow the laborers to return home after arriving at a certain place, it is now more difficult. People criticize armies that do not burden the people as good armies. When the 89th Division passed through Changsha without needing laborers, several farmers talked to me about it. But when it comes to local work, the people still participate enthusiastically. For example, the national defense works near Changsha now have × thousand people working, and the destruction of railways and highways is also mostly due to their efforts.</p>
<p>March in Changsha has revived from the scorched earth, because the great Chinese nation is the most resilient to disasters and the most courageous in creation! (March 22, 1939, in Changsha.)</p>

<h3>England's Attitude Towards Poland Applauded by US and France If Germany Invades Poland, Resistance Will Be Decided Britain and Soviet Union Closely Discuss Aid to Poland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 31st] High-ranking authorities here have applauded the guarantees given to Poland by Britain and France, believing this to be the first unexpected effect of President Roosevelt strengthening the political cause of European democracies. This guarantee not only turns the shadows caused by Britain's policy toward Germany into a clear future, but also ends the criticism and distrust of the British government by some important American newspapers since the British government implemented this policy. The British and French guarantees to Poland undoubtedly caused British stocks to soar, especially at this critical moment when some senators, such as Bora, constantly attacked President Roosevelt's policy, claiming that Britain had no intention of resisting German aggression, and even tacitly approved of it. Such views can no longer generate any significant force, of course.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, after the conclusion of mutual talks between Britain and other countries, the Prime Minister will issue another statement. Britain has reported the development of the situation to the United States in detail. Before Chamberlain's speech, the speech was also sent to Washington in advance. The authorities strongly stated that the Prime Minister's decision to issue a statement was entirely based on the general tense situation in Europe and the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia, and not due to recent receipt of unfavorable news that was not released. The anti-Polish propaganda launched by the German press recently and the boiling of the Polish issue are roughly related to previous events. Especially today, things can change in an instant, causing a general feeling that there is no room for risky hope at this time. In Chamberlain's statement, he did not oppose the possibility of Polish-German negotiations on Danzig. On the contrary, the Prime Minister still strongly advocated that international negotiations should eliminate misunderstandings.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 31st] After Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons, he immediately met with Lloyd George, who was the Prime Minister of Britain during the European War.</p>
<p>[Reuter, Paris, 1st] The French press praised the firm attitude of Britain, while also focusing on Poland's determination to maintain its independence. "Le Petit Parisien" stated that Britain's attitude is extremely important, and Romania will also receive similar guarantees as Poland. The fortress of security is being organized and is extremely successful, it said. Also, "Le Petit Journal" stated that if Poland obtains formal and definite guarantees from Britain, it is because Poland has decided to maintain its independence and is prepared to use force for defense.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 1st] Chamberlain's official statement was greeted eagerly here. It is generally believed that this is a serious blow to Hitlerism. This declaration is a great contribution to the establishment of an anti-Hitler bloc.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] The first reaction of the members of the House of Commons to the Prime Minister's announcement of guaranteeing Poland's independence was the firm support of the government faction and the goodwill of the opposition party, and the hope that the policy declared by the Prime Minister can develop along an appropriate path. The earliest impression that the statement gave to the general public was the relaxation of the tense situation in the past twenty-four hours. Chamberlain has gone to a country villa for the weekend, and most of the other important government officials have also left the capital, but they are all nearby and can be assembled immediately if necessary. The House of Commons international issue discussion will probably be held next Monday. According to the scheduled procedure, Greenwood and Dalton will be the main speakers for the Labor Party, and Chamberlain will be the main respondent for the government. Chamberlain's speech has given a very good impression to the stock exchange, and the market prices at the close were very high.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 31st] Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration, which indicates a sudden change in British foreign policy, can be described as a surprising move unseen in nearly twenty years. Chamberlain declared that when European security talks are underway, if Poland's independence is threatened and Poland resists, Britain and France will immediately provide military assistance. He also stated that Britain is currently discussing this issue closely with the Soviet Union. After the declaration was issued, the government spokesperson stated that British and French military assistance may extend to the Polish Corridor and Danzig, because the Prime Minister clearly stated that Britain guarantees assistance in "any conflict." It is also learned that this decision by Britain will cause the German-Polish talks on the Polish Corridor and Danzig to be on the verge of breakdown. Chamberlain also stated in his declaration that the government has not yet obtained official confirmation of the rumors of an attack on Poland. The British government has always advocated resolving international disputes through negotiations. The visit of the Polish Foreign Minister to London next Monday will enable detailed discussions and obtain appropriate methods to stop aggression, etc.</p>
<p>The Status of Danzig Cannot Be Changed</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] It is believed that the Polish government has made it clear to the German government that any unilateral action regarding changing the status of Danzig will be regarded as an action that threatens Polish independence, as mentioned in the British declaration.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] According to people close to the government, "If Germany does not respect our borders, we will definitely resist." The official reaction to Chamberlain's declaration was unanimous elation, considering it to be a guarantee of "equal peace" for both Eastern and Western Europe, unlike the Locarno Treaty, which only focused on the West.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 31st] According to reliable sources, the rumor that military negotiations are underway is not true. Because if there is to be a meeting, it should be after Polish Foreign Minister Beck goes to England. Regarding Poland's naval strength, related parties stated that the Polish navy currently has four destroyers and three submarines. If it is to fight against Germany by sea, it must borrow money to increase warships and increase a large number of naval personnel, because the current Polish navy can only be used to patrol the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Newspapers here today published Chamberlain's declaration in a prominent position, but did not criticize it. The Rome correspondent of "Il Messaggero" stated that "Britain is bound to make further efforts against centralized countries."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 31st] After British Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement in the House of Commons today providing guarantees to Poland, Italian officials did not comment. Political figures were deeply impressed and said that this statement directly involved Poland and Germany, and Italy, because it maintains close friendship with each of these countries, is also extremely concerned. Some parties said that the uneasiness caused by Germany's annexation of the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia has not yet been resolved, and now the Polish issue has been provoked, which is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 31st] Sir Charles, the British Charge d'Affaires, visited Foreign Minister Ciano in the evening and told him about Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement issued in the House of Commons today providing guarantees to Poland. He then had further talks with Foreign Minister Ciano in the evening, but what was discussed was not announced. Foreign Minister Ciano also met with the Polish Ambassador, Trouyo New Key, for discussions.</p>
<h3>Hitler Delivers a Speech Greatly Annoyed by British Aid to Poland Frequent Military Activity on the German Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Hitler will deliver a speech at Weissheimseewen from 4:45 to 5:00 today (Greenwich Mean Time).</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 31st] It is heard that Hitler is extremely angry at Britain's manipulation of the Polish situation and Chamberlain's recent declaration. All well-informed authorities believe that Hitler will definitely respond with an extremely tough tone when speaking at Weissheimseewen tomorrow. There was frequent traffic in the Foreign Ministry tonight. It is believed that Hitler has ordered his secretary to completely re-draft the sentences concerning foreign policy in the speech. It is heard that Hitler has consulted with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Information Director Diettrich. The official attitude tonight is particularly cautious, and the propaganda department has criticized the release of Chamberlain's declaration. The first newspaper to publish the declaration was not found on the market until 10 pm. A strong anti-British activity occurred in the afternoon. Newspapers were ordered to specifically state that this incident was similar to the incident on May 21 last year and the rumor two weeks ago that Germany issued an ultimatum to Romania. Officials continue to vehemently deny reports of German troop movements. Warsaw car drivers claim that German military activity on the Polish-German border is quite frequent, but it is impossible to determine whether this activity exceeds normal conditions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 1st] Today, the German 35,000-ton warship "Lien Bi Shi" was launched at Weissheimseewen Port. It is expected that Hitler will deliver an important speech at that time. However, it is believed that his speech draft will be completed while spending the night on a special train from Berlin to here. No one can predict how its content will express Chamberlain's declaration. It is generally believed that since the Munich Agreement, the principle of the Nazi Party's rule over Eastern Europe by the Germans has been possible. Chamberlain's declaration is the first direct attack, it is said.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 31st] The German government is currently studying Chamberlain's declaration carefully. It is generally believed that the declaration is extremely important. Before a detailed study, officials will not express their opinions for the time being. Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech tomorrow, at which time the first reaction from the German officials can be obtained. It is generally believed that the German reaction can be in two ways: (1) extreme indignation, and a strong counterattack in the newspapers, ordering Britain not to interfere; (2) expressing indifference, because they have not yet threatened Poland's integrity. It is generally believed that the former attitude is more similar.</p>
<h3>German Commentary</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 1st] The "Posen Times" published an article today, criticizing Chamberlain's declaration as another attempt to undermine peaceful relations, saying that this attempt is contemptible, and stating that Germany's plan to rule Central and Eastern Europe under Hitler's leadership will not be affected by external constraints. At the same time, the "Local Daily" also wrote a commentary saying that Chamberlain is playing with fire, and the guarantee to Poland is an impractical fantasy, because it has no new anti-German force.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Morning newspapers here do not place much emphasis on the importance of Chamberlain's declaration, saying that the declaration did not make Germany feel the slightest unease. It is believed that the newspapers' toned-down criticism is being carried out under orders, so that Hitler's speech today can be even more shocking. "Völkischer Beobachter" stated, "Chamberlain's declaration, intentionally or unintentionally, expresses a tendency to poison German-Polish relations." Also, "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" stated, "Germany views this declaration as another new link in the chain of lack of understanding and sincerity."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 31st] A German communications agency commented on Chamberlain's speech, "This kind of empty rhetoric still cannot hinder Germany's construction work in Central Europe." The communications agency also said that it was like a bolt from the blue, and it was deeply incomprehensible that Chamberlain made this announcement in an instant. "In fact, its content is not novel at all, because over the years, because of their alliance, Britain and France would assist Poland if it was attacked by foreign forces. This is something everyone knows. Chamberlain's deliberate disruption and the spread of an atmosphere of distrust of Germany is ridiculous. The suspicion that Germany will use force to invade others does not exist."</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Broadcast Ready to Fight at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lecce, 31st] Mussolini broadcast today, and the speech was covered by the cheers of the crowd. When he mentioned the phrase "people living across the Alps," the crowd taunted the person he was referring to. Mussolini said: "We are now preparing everything to defend ourselves. Strong countries are often rich, and weak countries are often poor. In the first stage of fascism, the situation was very obvious, but in the second stage, the results will be even greater than the first stage. The international community is like a family, and Italy is a first-class figure. I will speak on Sunday, so there is no need to say more now. People living across the Alps deny the facts and predict that the fascist people will separate, but the facts prove the opposite. The people under fascist rule are united more firmly every day." Mussolini ended his speech, almost covered by the cheers of the crowd. He said that Italy is like a young man, ready to fight at any time.</p>
<h3>British Political Developments The King of Romania Pays Close Attention Denies the Dismissal of the Minister to Hungary Hitler Receives the New Romanian Minister</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 1st] King Carol of Romania is paying close attention to the recent political developments in London. He has recently recalled the Second Secretary of the Romanian Embassy here, Dimansiqi, to report to the government. The Romanian Minister, Tieli Ya, left here last week for the capital of Hungary. The rumor that Tieli Ya has been dismissed has been denied. The reason for Tieli Ya's return to the country is unknown, and the date of his return is also undecided.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 1st] Hitler received the new Romanian Ambassador to Germany yesterday for a long talk.</p>
<h3>Subway Trains Collide in New York Suburbs More Than Sixty People Injured</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 31st] Two subway trains in the suburbs of here collided today, and more than sixty people were injured, including eleven seriously injured. The other passengers fled everywhere and were greatly frightened.</p>
<h3>Chen Youren's Remarks: Genuine Cooperation with the Soviet Union is Necessary to Effectively Counter Aggression</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Exclusive] Recently, the Haitong News Agency released information stating that a certain retired U.S. military officer believes that the Soviet Union's current military strength is far inferior to that of the Tsarist era. This reporter, considering Mr. Chen Youren as a strong advocate for Sino-Soviet cooperation, took this matter up with him to seek his opinion.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the reporter's words, Mr. Chen immediately smiled and said, "Rather than believing the words of a certain retired U.S. military officer, it is better to believe the estimates of German military experts."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen showed the reporter an editorial from the Manchester Guardian dated February 27th, and pointed out several sections quoting German officers' opinions on the Soviet Union's military strength:</p>
<p>(1) German staff officer Wenzasak declared, "The Russian army's offensive power is growing daily, and the bravery and strength of Russian soldiers are undeniable."</p>
<p>(2) A key figure in the German Air Force, Mr. Smelder, stated, "Russia can manufacture 12,000 to 15,000 aircraft annually by 1940. If a major war breaks out, the Russian Air Force can deploy 20,000 aircraft. Furthermore, Russia can move its military industry to safe zones during wartime, immune from any threat."</p>
<p>(3) The 'Military Weekly,' published by the German Army, stated, "The number of aircraft in the Russian Air Force is undeniably the largest in the world."</p>
<p>(4) The 'Maritime News,' published by the German Navy, even recognized that "Russia's current submarine fleet surpasses that of any other country in terms of the number of vessels."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also pointed out the conclusion of the Manchester Guardian, which stated, "Whether in Europe or the Far East, a strong Soviet Russia is a strong guarantee of peace."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen then slowly said: "The reason why Hitler can run rampant in Central Europe, and why young Japanese military officers can act recklessly and launch large-scale aggressions in China, is due to the failure of the authorities in China, Britain, and France to cooperate effectively with the Soviet Union in a timely manner. Today, if we want to effectively counter the threat of aggressor nations, the only way is to genuinely cooperate with the Soviet Union."</p>

<h3>Lithuania and Poland Non-Aggression Treaty Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 31st] Lithuanian envoy to Poland, Mr. Sulys, recently returned to his country to discuss the establishment of a non-aggression treaty between Lithuania and Poland with government authorities. This has now been completed, and he is scheduled to return to his post tomorrow. It is reported that the Lithuanian government broke off relations with Poland after Vilnius was occupied by Polish troops in 1920 and only accepted Poland's ultimatum and restored normal diplomatic relations and railway transportation in March of last year after border disputes arose between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Australia and Canada Cannot Remain Neutral if Britain Goes to War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Melbourne, 1st] The Melbourne Sun reports that Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons yesterday clearly demonstrates that if Germany invades Poland, Australia will also be drawn into the vortex. Germany should finally understand that Britain is not bluffing and is indeed prepared for war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ottawa, 1st] Canadian Minister of Justice Lapointe stated in the House of Commons yesterday that if the United States goes to war, Canada will naturally not be able to remain neutral.</p>

<h3>35,000-ton German Battleship "Tirpitz" Launched, Third Battleship Planned</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Wilhelmshaven, 1st] Thousands of people from various parts of Germany arrived here on fifty special trains and hundreds of cars to attend the launching ceremony of the 35,000-ton battleship "Tirpitz" and listen to Hitler's speech. Last night, naval units and military bands paraded through the crowded streets here, and the docks, shops, and houses were heavily decorated. The people were extremely excited. Several warships are currently docked here, and it is expected that more warships will participate. The "Robert Ley" is also among them. Hitler may board this ship for a short cruise. The tonnage of the third battleship in the plan is currently unknown. Authorities have hinted that it will be a 45,000-ton battleship named "Frederick the Great."</p>
<h3>Tunisian Storm (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>This method of opening up history and settling old scores is naturally of no help to the overall situation. Moreover, now, haven't the French, Italians, Babbis, Moors, Jews, Arabs, and other natives all settled in Tunisia and lived in peace? Within Tunisia, the Italian people have their own sphere of influence. Many places have been completely Italianized. Even tourists in those places take on some Italian characteristics. People who have just gone to Tunisia often feel that there are more Italians than French, but this year's population survey points out that there are indeed more French than Italians. Italy will always object to the numbers in this survey. Her reason is that many Italian immigrants have been forced to become French citizens.</p>
<p>This kind of statistical dispute is, of course, tedious. The fact is that France has an administrative body in Tunisia. Tunisia is exceptionally prosperous under French management. Judging from this situation, who would believe that France would be willing to give it up? Of course, it is not necessarily impossible, but Britain would never allow her to give it up.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, Tunisia has indeed become a problem now. It is no longer possible to muddle along. Unless France simply cedes Tunisia to Italy to rule. In fact, Italy has long occupied a share of everything in Tunisia. There, Italy enjoys various privileges: autonomy, land rights, and national rights. In theory, France could have objected to these facts long ago, but no one dared to stand up and do so. Conversely, although Mussolini signed a peaceful agreement with Laval in 1935, he now dismisses it all in one breath, citing France's launch of "sanctions" as an excuse. Naturally, the problem will eventually have to unfold. Although France wants to hide, Italy is pressing hard.</p>
<p>How this problem will be solved is difficult for anyone to say now. But we believe that only harmony is the right path. We advise Mussolini not to imitate Hitler and threaten war again. You must know that the European battlements are already clearly different. Suffering is self-inflicted.</p>
<h3>Germany Hints Slovakia Make Concessions to Hungary, Details of Border Demarcation Expected to Be Resolved Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 31st] Slovakia and Hungary may agree to demarcate the entire border between Slovakia and Ruthenia. The final details will be resolved on April 3rd.

<p>[Central News Agency, Bratislava, 31st] Regarding the issue of border demarcation between Hungary and the Slovak state, the Hungarian government has submitted a memorandum of demands, requesting the state cede several areas and demanding a reply by noon today. The state government telegraphed the German government yesterday, requesting its intervention.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's "Example"</h3>
<p>We will not dwell on what impression the name Wang Jingwei makes in the minds of every patriotic and courageous Chinese person. The fact that Wang Jingwei is still freely publishing his writings today is bound to arouse the hatred and anger of every patriotic citizen, which is an inevitable reality. However, we do not wish to comment on it either. What we are still willing to discuss, even at the risk of staining our ink, is a lengthy article entitled "An Example" by Wang Jingwei, published in the ×× Daily yesterday, which catered to the wishes of the Japanese aggressors, sowed discord among our nation's unity, and undermined the trust between our government, political parties, and the people!</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's article begins by excusing Zeng Zhongming's neglect of his duties [×××××××××] and praising him for "dying for national affairs." There are many such "examples" that reverse right and wrong; this is not the first time, so we will not discuss them in detail. The article then writes about the "records" of the "54th Standing Committee Meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council," saying that in December 1937 (note! when Chairman Chiang was leading the war effort in Nanjing, Jingwei convened a meeting in Hankou), Xu Mo reported in detail on the negotiations with German Ambassador Trautmann on resolving the Sino-Japanese War. We must adopt an absolutely reserved attitude as to whether this "record" is reliable or whether Xu Mo's report in the record is truly the case. However, even if everything cited in Jingwei's article is completely reliable, it only says that Germany, a helper of Japan at the time, sent its ambassador to China to conduct so-called mediation with our authorities. A small number of pro-Japanese elements such as Jingwei also gladly supported this matter in order to help Japan subdue China, but the result was that our authorities refused. No matter how hard traitors and collaborators try to insist that certain government leaders also agreed to peace talks, facts speak louder than words! At that time, the Japanese aggressors used international helpers and collaborators in China to carry out the conspiracy of peaceful inducement, but it was ruthlessly defeated because our highest leader accepted the public opinion of the people! Wang Jingwei still wants to slander the leader and drag people into the water today, even writing three so-called questions, but because of the fact that our leader unites the country and insists on resisting the war, his words are aimless and become a self-defeating "example"!</p>
<p>Following this, Jingwei's article contains what is called "a word for the people" and what is called "a major plan for war and peace." We, the people, have long been tired of hearing this. We may still briefly point out its errors one by one. First, Wang claims: "If the conditions do not affect the nation's survival and independence, what is wrong with advocating peace?" Then why did Czechoslovakia last year negotiate peace with Germany, and even have the Munich Agreement in which Germany, Britain, and France guaranteed its survival and independence, only to suffer the disaster of destruction today? Does the advocate of peace want our country to suffer a second Czechoslovakia? Second, he claims "Using resistance as a means of internal unification is something I absolutely oppose; advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not lead to division." In fact, China seeks liberation through resistance and has unification, not "using resistance as a means of internal unification." The traitorous surrenderers distort the sacred meaning of resistance, even openly oppose unification, and advocate division. Their loyalty to Japan can be called true. Third, he falsely accuses the Communist Party of having a nature of creating chaos, but in fact, the Xi'an Incident was calmed and unification was promoted through the efforts of the Communist Party. Moreover, since the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party has faithfully obeyed the leader, led the people, and insisted on resisting the war. Jingwei should also know that the facts are obvious, but if he does not slander the Communist Party, how can he win the favor of Japan? I think Jingwei has no choice but to engage in "an example" of such behavior! In addition to the above, the following paragraphs in Jingwei's article are all verbatim copies of Japanese propaganda, such as "What I sincerely and wholeheartedly seek is a grand plan for East Asia for a hundred years," which is really not worth staining my ink. Finally, he finally revealed the true intention of writing this article! He said, "I have heard that the National Government (this is the tone the Japanese use to refer to our central government) is working hard to promote international mediation, which is acceptable. However, at least international mediation and direct negotiations should proceed simultaneously. In this way, I can assist from the sidelines in my capacity as an unofficial figure, which would not be without help." So it turns out that he still wants China and Japan to hold "direct negotiations" so that he can play the role of a pro-Japanese figure and "assist from the sidelines." In fact, the so-called "National Government is working hard to promote international mediation" is originally a malicious rumor created by Japan, which has already been refuted and denounced by Minister Chen Cheng. Now Wang has repeated the old rumor, which can be said to be a good understanding of Japan's intentions! I don't know what kind of "example" this is for the people!</p>
<p>However, this is not just a simple article, nor is it just "an example" of Jingwei exposing his ugliness. We must know that the Japanese aggressive military forces are sinking deeper and deeper into the mire and are eagerly seeking political conspiracies to extricate themselves. Recently, they deliberately spread rumors of international mediation and exaggerated the change in Sino-German relations, aiming only to weaken the prestige of our government among the people and internationally. Their purpose of sowing discord among our domestic unity and international relations is only to stop China's united resistance in order to realize peaceful inducement and conquer China. Jingwei can be said to anticipate the wishes of the Japanese and has fully displayed his abilities!</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Military Authorities Add Defensive Works in the New Territories, Large Amounts of Sandbags Piled Up in Strategic Locations in Shatin, Barbed Wire Nets Arranged for Several Miles Along the Coast</h3>
<p>In light of the increasingly dangerous international situation, the Hong Kong military authorities are seeking to strengthen their naval, land, and air forces. In addition to constructing barracks, air raid shelters, and air defense rooms in Kowloon, and creating a naval district on the sea surface in the Aberdeen area, the authorities are also setting up defensive works in various areas. It is learned that the authorities, in order to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, have recently dispatched a large number of military personnel to the key points of the New Territories to pile up large amounts of sandbags to guard against any eventuality, and especially to pay attention to Shatin. Because the seabed near that area is very shallow, especially the seashore to the right of Shatin Station, barbed wire nets have recently been placed in the Shatin area, such as "Che Kung Temple," for several miles, and the consolidation is very meticulous. Also, Hong Kong's air defense training is currently being carried out vigorously. In addition to the Central District Section Instructor having scheduled to start classes at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on the 4th of this month, other districts will also open classes in turn. It is estimated that the training can be completed entirely in the summer of this year. Regarding the responsibilities of these air defense instructors, many are not fully understood. It is learned that the responsibilities of these instructors are purely in the form of social service. After training, the members of each district will designate the position they will serve in. Each position will have six or eight instructors, with four or six men and one or two women. One person will be recommended as the squad leader to be responsible for the affairs of this position. In the event of an air raid during an emergency period, they will come out to serve, and they will guide citizens on how to avoid air raids, such as entering air raid shelters or prohibiting pedestrians and controlling lights. If there is any bombing, they will notify the fire or ambulance personnel. Each air defense post is equipped with defensive materials such as sandbags, so the position of the air defense personnel is actually safer than that of ordinary people. It is also learned that there were originally more than 6,000 guide instructors in the Central District Section A. After the decision to open classes, yesterday, more than 20 people registered as volunteers to be air defense instructors, but most of them were men. It is hoped that women with a passion for serving the social masses will rise up and join.</p>
<h3>This Year's Children's Day Celebration Will Be Unprecedentedly Grand, 80,000 National Flags Have Been Issued to Raise Funds for Refugee Children, Hundreds of Refugee Children from the War Zone Will Participate in the Commemoration</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Kowloon Education Sector Joint Commemoration Preparatory Committee for "April 4th" Children's Day held its second meeting yesterday, with Committee Members Xie Feilie and Liang Shikuan reporting on the progress of the preparations. It was briefly stated that this year's Children's Day celebration will be grander and more meaningful than any previous year. The success of the flag donation campaign will exceed our expectations. The small national flags issued since the day before yesterday have reached 80,000 schools. Unfortunately, due to the short time, not enough could be produced, and the goal of universal distribution could not be achieved.</p>
<p>Donating National Flags Instead of Gifts</p>
<p>Last year's Children's Day had a program of giving each other gifts. This move can also train children's spirit of universal love. However, this year, selling flags allows children to commemorate this country, which is in a serious national crisis, by loving the national flag. Secondly, it can raise funds to relieve refugee children in the war zone, achieving two goals with one action. Currently, the schools that have received the national flags, with more than 1,000 flags, include: Lingdao, Guanghua, Guangzhong, Zhixing Chonglan, Southwest, Yangzhong, Lingdong, Overseas Chinese, Meifang, Nanyang, Xinjian, Confucius Society, and South China. The remaining schools are also going to receive flags one after another. At the same time, this preparatory committee has notified all schools that in addition to students receiving them themselves, they can also send them to parents. The love of children and the love of the country will be fully expressed on this day.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Refugee Children from the War Zone to Participate</p>
<p>As for the order of the meeting and the recreational program (in the Queen's Entertainment and Two Theaters in the Hong Kong area), the Secretary for Chinese Affairs has agreed. The number of the presidium of the conference is set at 20 for Entertainment and 14 for Queen's. The schools have already reported their lists. Approximately 3,000 students from the Hong Kong area will participate. In addition, hundreds of refugee children from the Wartime Child Care Association will participate. More than 20 schools will participate in various programs. The declaration of the conference (i.e., the opening speech) has been approved by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Revenue Increased in February, Revenue Reached More Than 2.95 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, both revenue and expenditure of the Hong Kong government have been increasing month by month. The Hong Kong government's revenue in February totaled 2,957,050.51 yuan, while in the same month last year it was 2,668,392.31 yuan. The total revenue for the first two months of this year was 6,930,348.83 yuan, while it was 6,426,590.60 yuan in the same period last year. The expenditure in February was also 500,000 yuan higher than in January. The revenue of each department has increased, with tax revenue being the most, totaling 200,000 yuan. License and internal treasury revenue also reached 60,000 yuan. Postal revenue totaled 214,270.48 yuan, 20,000 yuan more than last month. The revenue from government property, however, slightly decreased, totaling 52,778.30 yuan, a reduction of approximately 3,000 yuan. In the first two months of this year, the total expenditure was 6,270,758.13 yuan, compared to 5,520,922.32 yuan last year. The expenditure in February totaled 3,276,626.93 yuan, which is 573,000 yuan more than last year. Charitable expenses totaled 205,354 yuan, compared to 20,631 yuan last year.

<h3>Student Relief Association to Hold Third Election Today, Noon at YMCA Auditorium, Choir Recruiting New Members to Participate</h3>
<p>The terms of office of the executive committee of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association have expired according to the charter, and the third election will be held today. In order to achieve satisfactory results in the election, the association has established an election committee to prepare for all election matters and has drafted a draft charter for the next term so that it can be submitted for discussion at the delegates' meeting. It is heard that the charter for the next term will be slightly improved, such as adding a supervisory committee and establishing an administrative advisory committee. The administrative advisory committee will be composed of teachers from various schools hired by the executive committee. The standing committee will be divided into five departments: secretary, organization and propaganda, life, and fundraising, and will set up Hong Kong and Kowloon district committees to promote the work. The election date has been set for 2:00 p.m. today at the YMCA Auditorium. Also, since hiring a famous instructor for training, the association's choir has become more active. Recently, it was invited by the broadcasting station to broadcast patriotic songs and harmonica music, with very satisfactory results. Now, in order to further expand singing activities and cultivate talents to serve the community, the association is recruiting new members. All young students who wish to participate are requested to register with the association before April 15th.</p>

<h3>Nanyang Mechanics Enthusiastically Patriotic, 600 People Will Arrive in Hong Kong, The Largest Number of People Returning Home to Serve in the Past, Returned Home from Singapore on the Toyohira Wheel on the 27th</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, our overseas Chinese have been concerned about their homeland, donating large amounts of money to the country to relieve refugees. More people have voluntarily quit their jobs and returned home to serve. This patriotic spirit is highly admirable. It is learned that there have been two groups of mechanics from Singapore and other ports in Nanyang who have returned home to work in Chongqing. It is learned that the third batch has also set off in Singapore on the 27th of last month and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong during the day. This time, the number of people has increased compared to the previous two batches, making it one of the largest numbers of people returning home to serve in the past. A total of 597 people. It is learned that the third group of mechanics returning home to serve was originally initiated by the Singapore Chinese General Association. The number of places originally set was 300, but the number of people who registered reached 597. The association believed that this batch of overseas Chinese was enthusiastic and willing to participate in returning home to serve, so it accepted all of them. Led by leader Mr. Liu Beijin, they returned home on the Toyohira Wheel on the 27th of last month.</p>
<h3>Queen's Road Central: Three Dancers' Clothes Destroyed by Acid, Police Take Seriously and Investigate Closely</h3>
<p>On Queen's Road Central, three cases occurred within eight hours yesterday where dancers had their clothes destroyed by acid. In one case, a dancer's foot was injured. The police are taking the case quite seriously and are investigating based on the statements of the three dancers. One of the dancers, Ma Baolian (20 years old), residing at 43 Hennessy Road, was in front of the Queen's Theatre at 7:30 PM the night before when her modern long gown was suddenly destroyed by acid. A large hole was burned in the bottom of the back of her dress. The perpetrator fled and has not been located. At 9:30 PM, another incident occurred on Chiu Lung Street. A dancer named Bai Lianzhu (25 years old), residing at 11 Wing Sing Street, 2nd floor, was returning to the dance hall via Chiu Lung Street when a man suddenly splashed acid on her body. The clothes she was wearing were completely destroyed. Then, at 3:00 AM yesterday morning, a dancer named He Hanying (19 years old) was returning home from work, walking along Queen's Road, when a person suddenly approached and stopped her, and without a word, destroyed her clothes with acid. She tried to dodge, resulting in an acid burn to her foot.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurred in the New Territories Yesterday Morning: Four Armed Robbers Rob Two Residences. Cheung Lai's Residence in Tong Min Village Lost Several Hundred Dollars. Jockey's Stable Groom Robbed of Cash Yesterday.</h3>
<p>At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, four robbers, armed with four pistols and one sword, sneaked into Tong Min Village, Lam Tsuen Au, in the New Territories. They robbed two residences clean and fled. The victims were Cheung Tai-Cheung, 38 years old, and Lai Sun-Kiu, 34 years old, who had gold jewelry and silver items worth a total of $414 stolen. The robbers were all about 30 years old and were wearing black shirts and pants. After the robbers left, the victims went to the police station to report the crime. The police are stepping up the investigation. Furthermore, Fu Dao, a groom from the Hong Kong Jockey Club stable, was on his way from the stable to Tai Hang Road at 5:45 AM yesterday morning when he was robbed by two bandits of $130 in cash he was carrying while passing a small path. They fled towards Wong Nai Chung. Fu Dao reported the incident to the police station.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's Second Film and Drama Weekly Symposium: Welcome to the Chinese Drama Troupe</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Held Yesterday at Huanle Garden in Kowloon City</p>
<p>Hearts are beating, and hot tears are welling up in eyes. In a mix of gratitude and remorse, everyone vaguely realizes that they must be reborn and become the children of the Chinese nation that are needed. The gains from this gathering are truly abundant.</p>
<p>The fact is this: Yesterday at noon, this newspaper's Film and Drama Weekly held its second film and drama symposium at Huanle Garden in Kowloon, and welcomed the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe. In addition to the fervently welcomed Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and Lin Shu, three warriors, attendees included pioneers and enthusiastic workers from the film and drama industry, such as Cai Chusheng, Fei Mu, Situ Huimin, Fu Jiao, Zhao Yingcai, Tang Ruoqing, Li Qing, Huang Dacai, Zhu Baishui, Li Shulun, and others. (Mr. Ouyang Yuqian was unable to attend due to other commitments, and Mr. Hu Chunbing was unable to attend due to illness.) The scenery outside the garden is so quiet and fresh, a rare scenic spot in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Inside the garden, dozens of enthusiastic and progressive cultural workers are conversing so intimately. This symbolizes another side of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Fu delivered a speech first, turning the individual conversations into a symposium, discussing the importance of film and drama at the current stage and expressing our highest respect and warm welcome to the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe. In such a warm welcome, the handsome and lively Mr. Jin Shan began to move the hearts of those present.</p>
<p>"I am truly touched by the hard work of the gentlemen in Hong Kong. We must first pay our respects to you all! In a state of high excitement, what I want to say is disorganized, let me say whatever comes to mind.</p>
<p>"We have been engaged in the national salvation drama movement since we left Shanghai on August 13th, which has been a full nineteen months now. We are learning in the great era, and there is no waste of time. From our personal experience, we feel very optimistic. Optimistic about what? In simple terms: China can be saved."</p>
<p>——Mr. Jin Shan said excitedly and repeatedly that China can be saved. He cited many facts to prove that this is not an abstract slogan or a self-consoling statement.</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Jin enthusiastically reported on their work in the mainland over the past year, which was truly inspiring. Mr. Lin Shu also reported on his experiences participating in combat. When he spoke of the bravery of the soldiers, he couldn't help but shed tears, which deeply resonated with everyone's hearts. Ms. Wang Ying added that one would not believe the progress of China unless one went to the front lines. The cooperation between the military and the people is really great. The war of resistance is growing on one hand and destroying on the other. Although it is painful at the moment, the future is absolutely optimistic.</p>
<p>After listening to the reports of the three warriors from the front lines, Cai Chusheng immediately stood up and said what many people wanted to say: "I am so ashamed that I should commit suicide, I feel that I should immediately return to the embrace of the motherland." He continued to talk about the future of drama. Mr. Fei Mu also couldn't help but say that we should immediately launch a call:</p>
<p>Those engaged in culture who remain in Hong Kong should state their reasons for staying, and produce work, otherwise, they should jump into the sea from Wangtai.</p>
<p>We should be the backing for the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe in Hong Kong, enabling them to march overseas. Now, let us discuss how to help them.</p>
<p>Mr. Situ Huimin also offered some insightful remarks on strengthening the movement against cultural traitors and future liaison work.</p>
<p>In addition: Lu Dun, Li Qing, Ye Jian, Li Shulun, and others also expressed their opinions. Finally, concrete methods were discussed, which was truly a great gain.</p>
<p>Hearts are beating, and hot tears are welling up in eyes. In a mix of gratitude and remorse, everyone vaguely realizes that jumping into the sea from Wangtai is a sign of weakness, and that being reborn and becoming the children of the Chinese nation that are needed is the great path we should take.

<h3>China Travel Service Regular Charity Performance</h3>
<p>Raising Funds for the Women's Four-Association Alliance</p>
<p>Recently, members of the China Travel Service Drama Troupe, Tang Ruoqing and Tang Ruoying, proposed a charity performance to the four women's associations in Hong Kong to provide relief to refugees. The four women's associations held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Women's War Relief Association to discuss this matter. Many people attended, including He Yuzhen (Chairman), Wang Xiaoying, Huang Yang Ruolan, and Xi Xiuzhen. It was resolved to accept the proposal and to name it the "Hong Kong Women's Joint Council" charity performance to raise funds for comforting soldiers at the front. It will last for three consecutive days, with the performance venue set at the Lee Theatre. The performance work will be handled by the Comfort Association, the ticket sales group by the War Relief Association, the public relations group by the New Movement Association, the accounting group by the Women's Association, the affairs group by the Young Women's Association, the documentation group by the Moderation Association, the decoration group by the Promotion Association, and the publicity group by the Women's Comfort Association. Ticket prices are set at ten dollars, five dollars, two dollars, and one dollar. The next meeting will be held on the 5th, it is said.</p>
<h3>Adapting to the Needs of the Times: Four More Gas Mask Factories Established, Daily Production of 500 Masks to Meet Market Demand</h3>
<p>Due to the advancement of the times, human warfare has progressed from a plane to a three-dimensional one. Aerial destruction is the greatest enemy of mankind. All countries in the world are diligently working on air defense and anti-gas measures, especially focusing on anti-gas measures. Gas masks are an important guarantee of life in wartime. The Hong Kong government has been ordering large quantities from the UK in recent years to ensure sufficient supply during wartime. In addition, several rubber manufacturers on the market are also manufacturing gas masks for sale, and their products are selling well. Recently, four gas mask factories have been established in Hong Kong to meet the needs of the times. Products will be available in a few weeks, and it is said that a total of 500 masks can be manufactured daily. Among them, two factories already have a small number of products. These four manufacturers have received orders from the Chinese government for civilian gas masks, and their work has been progressing very actively recently.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation on the Western Front, Cost of Living Higher in Hong Kong, Fish Three Times More Expensive, Firewood as Expensive as Cassia Twigs</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the Jiangmen battle near Hong Kong, the supply of freshwater fish has been cut off from Jiangmen, and very little is coming from Zhongshan, so the price of fish continued to rise yesterday. Ling fish is more than 20 cents per catty, and large fish and whole fish are more than 40 cents, about twice as much as before the Jiangmen battle. Hong Kong's fish supply is divided into freshwater and saltwater fish. After the fall of Guangzhou, freshwater fish relied solely on supplies from Jiangmen and Zhongshan, amounting to 300 to 400 dan per day. According to news from the fruit industry, a large batch of vegetables arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou yesterday, so although supplies from Jiangmen have stopped, market prices have not risen too much. Regarding firewood, due to the reduction in ships traveling from Singapore, supplies have been greatly reduced. Previously, four ships, the Meinan, Meixi, Anshun, and Anhui, carried Singapore firewood to Hong Kong. Currently, only the Anshun and Anhui remain. Now, due to the impact of the war on the western front, firewood from the upper reaches of the West River cannot be transported to Hong Kong, so firewood prices have risen even further. The current wholesale price of ordinary firewood is $1.70 per 70 catties, and the retail price is only 60 catties. In addition, Lin Jiajun, the former chairman of the Student Relief Association, has been hired as the newspaper's manager to actively promote various tasks. It is said that the current issue contains a special article by Mr. Tao Xingzhi on overall education and overall resistance. Other sections include reading clubs, new women, and student clubs. The cartoon special issue and the amateur life weekly are particularly characteristic of the newspaper. It is said that the cartoon section is edited by famous young cartoonists Zheng Jiazhen and Lin Qin from Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Student Newspaper Resumes Publication Today, Expanded Pages with Large Format, Increased Cartoon Content, Rich and Varied</h3>
<p>The student newspaper founded by student leaders Xia Jiehua and Zheng Zhihuan in Hong Kong was suspended last month due to various obstacles. It is now ready and will resume publication today, expanding its pages and printing on a large format. To enrich the content and refresh the work, the newspaper has commissioned experts to write special articles for each section.</p>
<h3>Registration of British Residents Officially Begins Tomorrow, Registration Forms Have Been Sent Out Separately, Most Attention Paid to Mechanical Engineering Talent</h3>
<p>The Residents Registration Ordinance (all British residents residing in Hong Kong are subject to this ordinance) was passed by the Legislative Council yesterday (30th) at the third reading and will be implemented. British citizens between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five must register with the authorities in accordance with the ordinance. The Hong Kong government has now decided that tomorrow (3rd) will be the official start date for registration, and it must be completed within two months. The reporter visited the commissioner in charge of registration yesterday. It is said that all registrants must fill out the form clearly, preferably in English block letters, so as not to cause any obstacles during the sorting and cataloging process. Those with mechanical engineering qualifications should be sure to specify their level of experience and the types of machines they are familiar with. For the convenience of registrants, the police station has sent registration forms to various signed commercial firms for distribution to employees who need to register. At the same time, the forms will be mailed separately to registrants, but the police will not be responsible for any omissions. Each registrant is responsible for obtaining this registration form. The post office and the Chun Tin Hang Residents Registration Sub-office are distributing them.</p>
<h3>Kwangtung Wounded and Arrives in Hong Kong, Passengers Describe Encountering Danger in Detail, General Xiafei Sunk a Sailboat Before the Accident</h3>
<p>After the British post ship Kwangtung and the French post ship Zhenfei collided in fog outside Hong Kong the day before yesterday, the Zhenfei arrived back in Hong Kong at about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, unloaded passengers and cargo, and entered the Taikoo Dockyard for repairs. The Kwangtung also arrived at the Kowloon Wharf at about 9:00 PM in the evening. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company decided to transfer the Zhidulu to replace the European route to avoid delays, as the ship needs to be docked for repairs. The Zhidulu is scheduled to depart at 10:00 AM tomorrow. The Kwangtung's starboard side</p>
<p>was most severely damaged</p>
<p>by the Zhenfei's bow in a "　　" shape, denting in. The iron railings on the second-floor corridor were also destroyed. The third-floor wound penetrated deep, reaching the inner wall of the passenger cabin. The fourth-floor was the most severely damaged, especially the pilot's room. One minute before the accident, the pilot, Mr. Irwin, was having breakfast in the room. He unintentionally looked out the window and suddenly saw a giant ship coming sideways. Knowing it was a bad omen, he rushed out of the room. There was a loud bang, and the disaster occurred. Afterwards, he looked back at the room, which was full of seawater, as the hole was seeping in continuously. The radius of the hole reached twelve feet. The furniture in the room... Zhang Wenjie's photograph of the wounded Kwangtung returning to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>If Mr. Irwin had not rushed out in time, he would have hardly escaped. Fragments of the French post ship's anchor also fell into the room. The destroyed part of the fifth floor was the ice compartment, but fortunately, it was not penetrated. The shipowner, Mr. Morton, declined to comment on the accident, but said that the ship was not in danger of sinking. The passenger who saw the accident most clearly was Mr. Henderson of the Yves Saint Laurent perfume factory in London. Mr. Henderson was walking on the deck at the time and described the accident as follows: After breakfast, he went out on the side of the ship and leaned on the railing to look into the distance. He had already seen the French post ship approaching, but as he was not a navigator, he could not estimate the distance. However, he did not expect that</p>
<p>A Collision Would Occur</p>
<p>He had not yet finished thinking when the ship rushed straight towards his ship. He knew that there was no hope at this time. As he panicked, the other ship was only about twenty feet away. He quickly retreated, holding onto the cabin door to avoid falling. As expected, there was a violent jolt, and he lost his senses. Fortunately, he did not see any strange changes for a long time. He rushed to inspect and saw the French ship swaying and unstable, seemingly about to capsize. But in the end, it was able to hold on. At this time, the alarm bells rang loudly, and many passengers grabbed life jackets and went out to look at the lifeboats, which were also ready to be launched. Fortunately, all the passengers on the ship were exceptionally calm. After about an hour, the shipowner announced that there was no danger, and everyone returned to their cabins with peace of mind. The accident occurred at 8:50 AM. The crew members were able to handle the incident calmly, which was commendable. As for the French post ship</p>
<p>General Rofer</p>
<p>The damage was lighter. The ship needs to be docked for repairs, which will take fifteen days to complete. According to Zhu Desi, a Dutch passenger on the ship, before the accident, at about 8:00 AM that day, the ship mistakenly hit and sank a Chinese sailboat. At that time, the ship stopped to teach lifeboat drills. Unfortunately, the fog was heavy and the waves were large, and only broken pieces of the boat were seen, and the people were gone. After searching for a long time, knowing that there was no hope, they continued north. About an hour later, this disaster occurred.</p>

<h3>Welcome to the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe Roundtable</h3>
<p>Minutes of the Second Film and Drama Roundtable</p>
<p>Time:</p>
<p>12:00 noon on the 1st of this month</p>
<p>Location:</p>
<p>Kowloon City, Kar Lin Gardens</p>
<p>Organizer:</p>
<p>Shen Bao Film and Drama Weekly</p>
<p>Participants:</p>
<p>What is a road? It is what is trodden out from a place where there was no road. It can only be opened up from a place full of thorns.</p>
<p>The New Film and Drama</p>
<p>In China's culture, there was originally no road for drama. If there was, it belonged to a product of construction, only for the appreciation of a minority of people, never thinking of going among the masses. Since the new drama movement unfolded, it, like the Chinese nation's revolution, shouldered the heavy task of opposing imperialism and feudalism. After the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, the eyes of the whole world were focused on the life-and-death struggle of the Chinese nation. From that time on, the new drama movement became an important department of the new cultural movement in China. The new drama movement, like the military, became more solid day by day and more progressive day by day. A group of progressive drama workers left the cities and formed dozens of teams to go to the front lines, to the countryside, to the rear, everywhere发挥ing the artistic task of drama to publicize to the masses and educate the masses. The content and form have been rapidly improved, closely coordinating with the needs of the war of resistance, bravely shouldering the great tasks of the new era, and forming the most progressive and strongest department in the anti-Japanese cultural movement.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe is the most diligent and heroic elite force in this department. They were originally the Second Wartime Performing Troupe of the Shanghai Drama Circle National Salvation Association. Since August 13th, they have left Shanghai to promote the cause in various places, successively passing through Suzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Macheng, and later going south along the Yuehan Railway, turning into Hunan and entering Guangxi. Along the way, they used drama and singing to educate the masses, mobilize the masses, and publicize to the masses. Because of the seriousness of their lives and the diligence of their work, they were praised and welcomed by military and political authorities and people from all walks of life everywhere. Now they have expanded their national salvation propaganda overseas and are appealing to overseas Chinese on behalf of the soldiers on the front lines. They have decided to go to Singapore, the Philippines, and Xiangshan in Southeast Asia to perform dramas, give lectures, and exhibit films.</p>
<p>The Significance of the Roundtable</p>
<p>In order to further connect feelings and start collective discussions; and to express our respect for the troupe, this journal took this opportunity yesterday—see the special report in this newspaper—to hold the second film and drama roundtable, and at the same time welcome Mr. Jinshan, the head of the troupe, Ms. Wang Ying, the deputy head of the troupe, and Mr. Lin Shu, a military expert who accompanied them to comfort overseas Chinese. Everyone took their seats around 12 noon. The host, Lu Fu, stood up to speak, and the general idea was as follows:</p>
<p>——Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, today is the second tea party of the Shen Bao Film Roundtable. (Omitted) Originally, this roundtable was planned to be held every two or three weeks, but since the first meeting was held on January 25, almost two months have passed. This is because everyone's work is very busy, especially the workers in our own newspaper, who are extremely busy. I am really sorry. The significance of holding this roundtable this time is, in addition to being the same as last time, to welcome the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe to Hong Kong on their way to promote the cause abroad, and to express our respect. At the same time, there are a few points of view that I would like to put forward here. Second: I hope that the leaders of the troupe can provide information on their national salvation drama movement and experiences from all over the country over the past year or so, for our reference and lessons in our work; Second point: I hope that all the advanced comrades present, based on their valuable experience and strict training, will conduct a heated discussion on the practical problems of the national salvation movement at this stage, especially in the special environment of Hong Kong; Although the working methods in the country can fully adapt to this special place, their working experience can give us many valuable references and strict training; Third: We hope that all the advanced comrades present will, in addition to extending the feelings of brothers and sisters who have returned from the war to the troupe and warmly welcoming them, also provide more practical assistance in their work for the sake of the entire drama movement and for the entire national liberation struggle, so that they can achieve the results they deserve.</p>
<p>Amidst applause, Lu Fu sat down, and at the same time, amidst applause, Mr. Jinshan stood up.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan was polite and frank, but when he spoke, he was eloquent and talked non-stop. Mr. Jin spoke a lot, and what is recorded here is only a part of it, and it is a general meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan's words</p>
<p>Mr. Jin's first point is: Because of the nineteen months of the war of resistance, we have gained an experience. That is: China is happy and optimistic, and China has a way to do things. The process of nineteen months has told us many iron-like things that the war of resistance will surely be victorious. Overseas Chinese attach importance to organizing resistance and supporting the military. After the victory in the future, the government will definitely answer overseas Chinese and protect overseas Chinese. The second point is: I am an actor, let's talk about acting. In the past, in the city, I could perform a city youth: but I couldn't perform a farmer. Farmers are taller and bigger than Mr. Li Qing present, and their personalities and actions all have personality. Now that I have contacted them, I know, I believe I can act, although I can't be exactly like them, but I can be like a few points, and can be like a few points.</p>
<p>Lessons in Practice</p>
<p>Mr. Jin repeated his speech, paused for two pauses, and continued:——This time running into the mainland is much stronger than entering university. There are many new drama people who are better than us. This is a real feeling, not empty talk. They are convinced that the war of resistance will be victorious, they understand politics, they understand the international situation, and they contribute everything with the greatest enthusiasm. For example, when a devil comes, he kills the devil. This genuine expression is more real than ours and makes me moved to tears. The emotions of their people when performing dramas are all from the inside out, so it is particularly easy to touch the military masses. What they express is to learn from the real experience in real life.</p>
<p>Future Drama Movement</p>
<p>, the internal harm is aimed at the requirements of the masses; second, make good use of the old forms to enter the new content; third, the private lives of the staff must be serious; fourth, be sincere and refined; fifth, thorough political understanding.</p>
<p>——After Mr. talked about the points that should be paid attention to in the future drama movement, he seriously explained that we have such good soldiers, such good masses, and such good young people, so China really has a way to do it. Therefore, we must go to Southeast Asia in particular to let overseas Chinese know that the money and efforts they have put in will not be wasted; they will definitely be rewarded in the future.</p>
<p>"I hope that after going to Southeast Asia, I can realize the establishment of wounded soldier reception stations, reception centers, cultural supply stations, and arts and crafts centers in the motherland to accommodate the families of disabled soldiers and the families of fallen soldiers..."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Jin said, "This is not a matter for one person or one group, but the current task of the entire cultural circle. We are just a sentinel, willing to die rather than be timid, and ask you to be our backing."</p>
<p>It is the true feelings of family ruin and death. Their progress and their strength are really amazing. China's emerging drama is entrusted to these new fighters. I deeply feel that the set of stage techniques, lines, and the beauty of posture that I studied in the past are useless. They do not contain the masses. Therefore, we also followed him.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's Words</p>
<p>Then Mr. Lin Shu reported a little bit about military stories. The most touching was:</p>
<p>——In a certain place, the local people's headquarters asked: "Is it true that we are leaving tomorrow?" I wondered why military news was known to someone. So I called the squad leaders to hold a roundtable meeting, and I learned that the soldiers gave everything to the villagers the day before they left, because they were determined to die, and when the masses saw this situation, they knew that they were being transferred.</p>
<p>From this, it proves the soldiers' willingness to sacrifice. This spirit is the guarantee of victory.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Ying's words</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Ying's words are like this; we have been progressing, this war of resistance, while growing; while dying out, all the corrupt things have been eliminated in the artillery fire, and finally she said that the cooperation between the military and the people is the symbol and the proof of victory.</p>
<p>In Shameful Endeavor</p>
<p>Then Cai started to speak, and every sentence was painful. There are two main points: First, drama should not be regarded as an appreciation product for the upper class by only recognizing senior Chinese. Instead, it should go deep into the masses. At the same time, strengthen the united front and strengthen political understanding. Second: Avoid empty theories in content, tell the truth, and say things that can resonate with the masses. The content should be bloody and fleshy and reflect reality. He also solemnly said: Standing from the perspective of the country, military affairs are the first and victory is the first. Standing from the perspective of drama, the effect should be the first. If after a performance, the effect of education and political action is not achieved, no matter how much you study the background, posture, stage technology, and other superficial things, you will lose the true value of drama. Just as Mr. Lu Fu said, going to the restaurant and ballroom after leaving the theater is unacceptable. The correct worldview and political understanding of the expression of skills are the backbone of drama. Fei Mu's opinion is like this; the drama people who stay in Hong Kong should go back immediately if they have no work; otherwise, they should start working immediately to answer the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe. Situ Huimin attacked film merchants for falsely claiming that anti-Japanese films were banned in Southeast Asia, and asked the troupe to conduct a thorough investigation in Southeast Asia so that they could have a correct assessment of the objective environment. Are anti-Japanese films banned? Are even those that oppose traitors in the rear banned? Are even those that don't talk about Chinese people loving China banned? At the same time, he advocated strict criticism of cultural traitors and toxic films. Lu Dun also gave a detailed account of Hong Kong drama, and especially pointed out that it is wrong for Hong Kong drama to be in intellectual circles. He also criticized toxic films and said that he can still be saved, hoping that everyone will wake up. Li Qing said that he would rather starve to death than make toxic films, and expressed his respect for Jinshan. Every sentence was cautious and serious. Fei Mu said that he had something to do, and everyone applauded. Zhao Yingcai also advocated purging toxic films.</p>
<p>In the enthusiastic atmosphere, the meeting lasted for several hours before it ended with photos and tea.</p>
<h3>We Are Moving in One Direction</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>This war of resistance is a national war externally and a revolutionary war internally. On the one hand, it is tending to death, but on the other hand, it is growing up.</p>
<p>Today, no matter the front or the rear, the importance and significance of work are the same. When I arrived at ××, although I couldn't smell the gunpowder, the difficulties and obstacles in the work were incomparable to those on the battlefield. The spirit of people working optimistically and freely on the battlefield, when I arrived at ×× and saw the respectable friends, working hard in suffocation, moved me.</p>
<p>We are friends, comrades, our × people are common, our goals are consistent, and we are moving in one direction——to dedicate everything to the country and the war of resistance!</p>
<p>March 31st, Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe</p>
<h3>Welcome to the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe!</h3>
<p>In the past, the Chinese spoken drama movement was only in the circles of urban intellectuals and citizens. It never really went to the masses. Therefore, although the Chinese spoken drama movement has had a considerable history, it has not grown beautiful fruit and has not received the support and love of the broad society and the broad masses; it has only succeeded in being like an antique in an ivory tower, only gaining the appreciation of a few so-called wise people after tea and dinner!</p>
<p>However, since the start of the sacred national self-defense war, the spoken drama movement has gained a new opportunity for rebirth, opened up a new way of life, truly moved towards the masses, and penetrated into the countryside, where it established people's drama!</p>
<p>The "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" is one of the workers in this field. They started from the largest city in China—Shanghai, abandoned the comfortable urban life, ran to the inland, and even ran to the war zone, risking their lives in dangerous areas full of gunpowder for the motherland!</p>
<p>On the one hand, they are serving the motherland, using their tools—drama—to arouse the masses' enthusiasm for resisting ×, and even to organize the masses to serve the war of resistance; on the other hand, they are working hard for the construction of the future Chinese spoken drama movement, gaining experience from the war of resistance, and learning from the broad masses to lay the foundation for the creation of the new Chinese drama!</p>
<p>Under these two important meanings, the hard work of the "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" comrades is worthy of our respect, especially their spirit of hard work, courage, and sacrifice, which should be learned by the young people who are hiding in the rear.</p>
<p>Now, the "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" has come to Hong Kong, but they are not retreating, let alone escaping, but it is the beginning of their new work!</p>
<p>They are going overseas to tell the heroic stories of the war of resistance they have obtained from the war zone, especially the belief that final victory will surely belong to us, which has been proven by various experiences, and to strengthen the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for the motherland. This is a task of great significance!</p>
<p>We would like to sincerely wish the "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" success in this trip, for the motherland and for the future of the spoken drama movement!</p>
<p>Long live the Chinese nation!</p>
<h3>Welcome the "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Youth Drama Association</p>
<p>In a highly burning desire, the Chinese "National Salvation Drama Troupe" has finally arrived in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The news that they were going abroad via Hong Kong had been spreading among us for a long time. We were so eager for the arrival of this team, but the long time increased our anxiety and desire, but it also increased our wishes, and this wish has a sense of lofty admiration!</p>
<p>Now, they have appeared before us in a late posture.</p>
<p>After the war of resistance, the Shanghai Wartime Drama Circle National Salvation Association Mobile Performing Troupe, which gloriously wrote a page in the history of Chinese drama, is well known to everyone. It has successively organized fifteen teams to set off from Shanghai and scatter to the east, west, north, and south battlefields and rear areas, traveling through rural areas, factories, barracks, hospitals, trenches, and other corners, giving full play to the highly effective suddenness in the most inflammatory and active form.</p>
<p>The team with the bright name of "Shanghai National Salvation Performing Troupe Second Team" is even more deeply imprinted in our minds. After the August 13th Incident, they traveled from Shanghai to Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hankou. and Macheng and other places, and then traced along the Yuehan Railway southward to Hunan and Guangxi, working in perseverance and hardship. Now, in the name of "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe", they have been sincerely invited by the Guangxi Provincial Government to go overseas to promote the war of resistance and appeal for the soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>This spirit of struggle, the performance of a warrior in the national revolutionary war, is worthy of our learning and imitation in all aspects; these workers who are hard-working, persevering, and have the excellent qualities of the Chinese nation will undoubtedly be models for us to serve in the war of resistance in the future. As drama workers on the same front, especially those of us in Hong Kong who are in a state of demoralization and have lost our motherland, we will pay deep respect.</p>
<p>In colonial Hong Kong, ×× often looks forward to the motherland where the flames of war are everywhere, which makes us feel ashamed and also makes us feel that the responsibility is not far away. Therefore, we have also worked and struggled with a strong attitude, and have been pioneers and combatants in the Hong Kong cultural national salvation movement in our posts.</p>
<p>However, it is undeniable that our fighting strength is too weak; it is obvious that the performance of our work cannot keep up with the current stage of the war of resistance in the motherland, nor can it keep up with the workers who are fighting in the wilderness of the motherland.</p>
<p>Here, we should be ashamed and timid. We should learn, and we should fight more strongly for the motherland, for freedom and warmth!</p>
<p>Therefore, the National Salvation Drama Troupe, which has the heroic posture of "Xia Boyang" in the flames of the drama world, should be our best learner and model at this time!</p>
<p>Likewise, we earnestly ask our partners in the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe to give us who are working in Hong Kong with correct guidance and lessons of experience in the attitude of pioneers during this trip to Hong Kong. Only in this way, in the same position, can we join hands closely and strongly exude the power of drama struggle in the motherland's war of resistance!</p>
<p>Finally, we joyfully and deeply express our wishes, hoping that this trip abroad will bring the hardships of the motherland, the heroism of the soldiers, the misery of the compatriots, and the ××× to overseas, declare it to the overseas Chinese, and firmly tell them: the motherland is moving forward in victory! Victory is waving to us!</p>
<p>Hereby, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association extends its warm welcome and high respect to these heroic partners!</p>
<p>April 1, 28th year of the Republic of China, Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Drama Work in the War Zone</h3>
<p>— Jinshan</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, I followed the team to work in the mainland, passing through the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Jiangxi, lasting nineteen months, and contacting countless farmers, soldiers, and political youth. I gradually felt that my life had increased some brilliance and strength; sometimes I was so excited that I shed tears, because I saw our bright future.</p>
<p>Young students and children of wealthy families all abandoned their schools and families and ran to poor and remote places. They all planned to organize many drama propaganda teams. They had never been to drama schools, nor had they studied performing arts. However, their work showed that they were all excellent folk artists. They have the ability to motivate the masses and organize the masses, and their dramas are also the most joyful and touching dramas for the people; why? Because they have two basic conditions: First, they have a wealth of political understanding, and they are constantly studying the situation of the war of resistance and international issues, so their assessment of the future of the war of resistance is very accurate and optimistic. From their words and actions, they told the people that "the war of resistance will surely be victorious"! Second, they have a commendable enthusiasm. On the stage, they use sincerity to excite the audience and enlighten the audience. I often say to my colleagues: We don't need stage zombies, we need a fresh soul to jump in front of the audience. What we do and say is living reality. We want to gain the audience's resonance. This "resonance" cannot be said to be "acting", but we believe that this does not violate Stanislavsky's drama principle of "spiritual realism".</p>
<p>We need to learn, constantly learn, and constantly learn in real life. In the past nineteen months, in the places I have passed through, I have seen many novel characters. In our experience, we have seen through the shape and heart of each character, which is of great help to our drama.</p>
<p>Here I would like to briefly talk about the lives of the young people who are working hard in the war zone: Generally speaking, there are organizations such as battlefield service teams or national salvation drama teams in various war zones. Their lives are no different from those of soldiers and farmers; in the border areas of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, they are all scattered in various red spear societies. If they do not talk to you directly (or discuss a problem), you will not believe that they are intellectuals. In the past, some farmers in Gushi and other places organized their own drama troupes. When they performed dramas, there were hundreds of people in the crowd. They jumped, they roared, and they had inexhaustible vitality. There were also progressive drama youths leading them. We lived with the farmers in Dabie Mountain for more than two months. The farmers told us about their sufferings and expectations, and they were happy to listen to our opinions, which were all after watching our dramas and being moved.</p>
<p>In the war zone, young people are ashamed of not being able to live with the masses. From morning to night, they are trying to do today's work well. Work controls their nerves, and they are stimulated and excited all day long. There is no sorrow or disappointment.</p>
<p>I have an inaccurate statistic, that is, the number of farmers who were motivated by political workers, especially the influence of drama, and automatically participated in the war of resistance, is more than 20 million, which is an amazing record, and I believe that this record will continue to expand in coordination with the new situation of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>When performing dramas in Dabie Mountain, the farmers carried rice bags to watch the dramas. After watching the dramas, they cooked rice and ate, and then slept in the jungle or on the grass, preparing to watch again tomorrow. (At that time, the busy farming season had passed)</p>
<p>And the actors? They also slept with them, talking and laughing. This scene is still imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>Leaving the motherland, I can't help but miss my colleagues. In China's emerging drama movement, they have indelible achievements. I miss those pure and kind farmers even more; they are still fighting the enemy desperately: I wish them good health!</p>
<p>Hong Kong has given me a very good impression. Although it is "singing and dancing to promote peace", on the other hand, many friends are trying to turn a group of backward young people to a more progressive path. They have organized drama societies, hoping to divert the interests of these people. This is also a very difficult task. I hope that they can have the same spirit as their friends in the war zone and cooperate well with the drama movement in the war zone.</p>
<p>I am very happy to see many lovely friends here. I hope to shake hands tightly with these friends!</p>
<h3>On Stagecraft</h3>
<p>— Lu Dun</p>
<p>6.  Rhythm and Tempo</p>
<p>Everything that exists has rhythm – the ever-changing sunset and the iceberg that moves only two inches in two centuries both possess rhythm. Rhythm is an infinite, eternal cadence; all created things depend on rhythm to exist – to transform the finite into the infinite. R. Boloslavsky said: "Rhythm is the ordered, measured change of all the different elements contained in a work of art, and all these changes gradually arouse the viewer's attention, continuously guiding them to the artist's final purpose."</p>
<p>Dramatic art originated from the dances of primitive humans, and dance is the most rhythmic of the temporal arts. The performances of today's actors are evolved from these primitive dances, and therefore, the actor's performance also possesses rhythm.</p>
<p>The entire dramatic performance has its own definite "tempo" – which can also be considered a type of rhythm. Each actor's performance should also have its own specific "tempo." Although this "tempo" is completed during the performance, it must be decided and arranged well in advance.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we see actors on stage who seem to be reciting a book. All their actions are dull and uninteresting, unable to arouse the audience's interest. This is because the actor's performance lacks rhythm.</p>
<p>Drama is not a book. Within a play, the actor must possess a power sufficient to maintain the audience's mood, forcing them to patiently watch your performance from beginning to end without flagging, "gradually arousing the viewer's attention, continuously guiding them to the artist's final purpose." The completion of this power depends on the rhythm of the performance.</p>
<p>The so-called rhythm is nothing more than the three principles of "fast," "moderate," and "slow," just like the tones in music, or in common parlance, "ups and downs." Only in this way can changes occur, and it is through constant changes that the audience's curiosity can be maintained, attracting their attention and making them forget the boredom of sitting in the theater.</p>
<p>"No struggle, no drama," is a famous saying that explains the principle of drama, and it can also be used to explain the principle of acting. Struggle unfolds conflict, and within conflict, crises and climaxes naturally arise. Small crises accumulate into large crises, and small climaxes develop into the highest climax, forming the dramatic peak. The progress of drama is curvilinear, wave-shaped. The actor's performance must also grasp this point. When an actor receives the script, studies and understands the character they are playing, they can begin planning the performance of that character, finding the location of the highest peak and concentrating their energy on that place, doing their best to express it. In addition, find the peaks in each act, each entrance, each section, and even each action. What must be noted is that there must be a preparation for each peak before the peak, so that it is coherent and does not feel sudden. All the peaks are prepared for the "highest peak." The expressive power of the "highest peak" must be more outstanding than the secondary peaks and other peaks; otherwise, your performance is still a failure, because the rhythm is already disordered.</p>
<p>Of course, rhythm does not only refer to the rhythm of intonation in dialogue. It should also include movement. The actor performs through the combination of dialogue and movement, going back and forth. The rhythm of speech and the rhythm of movement are just like the difference between dialogue and movement, which must have an organic connection. They must harmonize with each other without conflict, heading towards the same goal and exerting a unified effect.</p>
<p>The rhythm of an actor's performance can be divided into two aspects: "conscious rhythm" and "mutual rhythm." Regarding "conscious rhythm," R. Boloslavsky said: "First is walking, second is speech, and third is emotion. Every step, every word, every emotion is a constant change, and each aspect has the same destination, the same final goal." When these can be practiced to the point where they can be freely manipulated by oneself, when external forces reflect their rhythm back, then a new rhythm is developed. The creation of this new rhythm is no longer individual, but communal. At this time, it is a chorus, not a solo. Therefore, your tone and key must be unified with the other person, that is, so-called unified breathing. There must be understanding and mutual restraint between each interaction, producing a "mutual rhythm" and creating a unified atmosphere.</p>
<p>The creation of rhythm in performance must be carefully planned and arranged by the actor themselves. Therefore, it can be used as a standard to judge the diligence and competence of a particular actor, and it can also be used as the best tool for an actor to capture the audience's attention.

<h3>Sing Hwa Team Suffers Defeat in First Trial of New Tactics, Ultimately South China Is Better, Sing Hwa's Short Passing Technique Is Very Good but Its Improper Use Is in Vain</h3>
<p>Xie Qingfu Decides to Play in Today's Match Against Hong Kong Selection</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The Sing Hwa "veterans" who returned from Nanyang staged their "premiere" here yesterday. Men and women alike climbed Jia Mountain, with an estimated crowd of over ten thousand. The lively scene of the Hong Kong-Philippines interport match was seen again yesterday. People say the football scene is thriving, and I agree, but I must add the phrase, "Wealthy amongst the 'upper-class refugees'."</p>
<p>Some of the football fans who witnessed the battle yesterday expressed disappointment with the performance of the Sing Hwa players, because Sing Hwa lost to South China's fierce attack with a score of zero to three. On the surface, it seems that their football skills are not very high, but disappointment aside, Sing Hwa is indeed a strong team, but the failure has many other reasons.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Singaporean footballers are known for their short passing technique. Yesterday's events told us that what we saw was indeed what we knew. The strategy adopted by Sing Hwa was indeed too much short passing. It was common to see an inside midfielder receive the ball, and unless it was quite urgent, they would not immediately kick the ball out, always seeking a fleeting opportunity to keep the ball at their feet, then dribble and pass it to the forward who was standing closest to them. Sometimes, even the midfielders would pass to each other. This kind of circuitous offensive strategy is quite effective in dispersing the defensive formation of the opposing defenders, but it can only be used in the middle of the field and never everywhere. The Sing Hwa players focused solely on short passes, which was unnecessarily time-consuming and resulted in mistakes, so progress depended on accurate passing to penetrate. But it's not certain that penetrating deeply means opportunity. If intercepted, the previous efforts are wasted. The forwards have to work very hard and it's not easy to find a way out, but even finding a way out doesn't guarantee a shot on goal. If it is cleared by a South China defender with one kick, all the efforts are in vain. Therefore, although Sing Hwa's short passes are wonderful and beautiful, and their running is quick, the circuitous attack is not as effective as a direct, near-attack that acts according to the situation. Even if it is effective, the forwards are not good at shooting. Several balls that could have won were lost due to the final shot on goal. I think that if the Sing Hwa forwards had the same support from the midfielders as South China, and did not rely on "solely short passes", then the attack would be much sharper. Hopefully, they can find a way to improve this today.</p>
<p>Xie Qingfu, the "new Li Huitang" admired by fans, put on his full uniform, but was not seen on the front line. It is said that he suffered a minor foot injury while fighting in the Philippines. After resting for another day, he decided to play in today's match against the Hong Kong Selection. Also, regulars Deng Yuehan, Wen Guanzong, and Xia Zhixiang are also watching from the sidelines like Qingfu. Therefore, Sing Hwa's combat power is slightly affected. If they appeared with the original lineup, even if they still couldn't beat South China, they would at least have one or two goals in return. This is not to cover up after Sing Hwa's defeat. In fact, Sing Hwa had several sure-win opportunities, but unfortunately, they didn't have forwards who were good at shooting, so they missed them. If Fu Qing was on the front line, then other good opportunities go without saying. A single penalty kick would be guaranteed to be scored.</p>
<p>After seeing the heading skills of the Sing Hwa players, everyone praised them. In the South China lineup, only Liang Rongzhao can compare. It's a pity that they are good at short passing, good at heading, and run as fast as rabbits, but when fighting, they stick to the rules and don't know how to change, so they can't adapt to the situation. The defenders, threatened by Li Huitang's "name", focus on his personal actions, so they often adopt a concentrated interception method, focusing on Li Huitang and neglecting others, which gives the South China team gaps to attack from the flanks. Deng Guangsen and Yang Shuiyi often received supplies from the inside forwards, were exceptionally active, and frequently launched attacks, eventually scoring three goals.</p>
<p>South China is also known for short passes, belonging to the same school of thought as Sing Hwa, but the South China players know how to change and act according to the situation. It must be understood that ball games are like warfare. There must be substance, but also use. With use, there must be substance. Only when substance and use are combined can one succeed. The South China players have been through many battles and know the key to substance and use, so they achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Rongcai "came out of the mountains", Bao Jiaping has another disciple. Therefore, he has rarely appeared on the field recently. In this great battle, the South China authorities did not choose others, but showed "favor" to Jiaping, which is a profound intention to use talent. The reason is that Jiaping traveled south many times before and gained experience. The "old horse knows the way" and sees the "ball path" of the Singaporean players clearly. Sure enough, his performance yesterday was exquisite, truly a master craftsman.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most outstanding performance of the Sing Hwa players was Zhu Chenggui. He was full of energy, and the ball arrived when he did. His heading was especially certain. Although he was unable to completely control Huitang yesterday, he didn't lose a single high ball. However, the strategy he adopted was not the third inside defender defense method, but a concentrated defense combined with a triangular passing attack method. Using this method to deal with South China is ineffective.</p>
<p>The two inside midfielders, Chen Kaiwan, were better than Sun Chunlai, but they still couldn't kick the ball far. Also, the positions of the two were often inappropriate. Goalkeeper Li Botang has wonderful skills, such as pouncing and catching, with no flaws. Midfielder Xu Houkun's position was slightly forward than Ji Youling, but he suddenly dribbled the ball out to attack and suddenly retreated to defend, running too much, eventually leading to chaos.</p>
<p>The center forward, Long Liwu, didn't fully demonstrate his leadership skills, but he was very lively. Wei Ci's style was also fierce. It can be seen how capable winger Li Haizhu is as he often earns a pass from Li Tiansheng. Cai Yuehan also had good moments, while He Guocai didn't do much well. In short, the forwards' progress was extremely fast, but it's a pity they didn't bring their "shooting shoes."</p>
<p>The performance of the South China players was generally good. Their superior skills are extraordinary. Huitang's first goal can be called divine. Jiaping's repeated rescue of the situation can be called a miraculous recovery. Rongzhao's imposing manner was overwhelming, and Tiansheng's power rejected the invading army. Feng Jingxiang was meticulous and subtly gained victory. Li Zhaorong assisted with merit and cooperated consistently. All these are commendable. Guangsen was quick and decisive, using all his "tricks," while Shuiyi was "disordered and uncontrolled," cutting the ball inaccurately. (Football Field Ogre)</p>
<p>Last Night's Basketball Game: South China Defeats South China, Grade B Police Also Defeats Zhong Sheng by One Point, Chunfeng Wins Lingying with 55 to 37</p>
<p>In yesterday evening's first public men's basketball game, the Grade B Police team faced Zhong Sheng. In the first half, Zhong Sheng took the lead by several points. When the Police team tried their best to counterattack, they tied the score twice. At the end of the game, the two sides were still tied at thirty to thirty. In the overtime, the Police team finally won by a narrow margin of forty-one to forty. In the second game, the Grade A South China team faced South China. The two teams were evenly matched and fought desperately. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented since the start of this tournament. In the fifteen minutes before the end of the game, the two sides tied several times. The atmosphere in the stadium was tense for a while. Until the last minute, South China relied on Huang Zuode's sudden special skill from the sidelines, and the ball went into the basket, finally securing the victory with a score of fifty to forty-eight.</p>
<p>South China's victory should be attributed to the three pillars of Yi Zuode, Zhong Ling, and Chen Zanyin, but they were not outstanding in the first half, especially their shooting accuracy was lacking. There were flaws in the team's communication. Because South China sometimes adopted a zone defense and sometimes a man-to-man defense, the South China forwards could not penetrate deeply, so they were forced to shoot from a distance, but only one in ten shots went in, so they lost the first half with a score of nineteen to twenty-three.</p>
<p>In the first half, because South China's strength was not sustained, on one hand, and because Huang Zhong and Chen's ball skills gradually became normal, South China turned favorable. Seeing that dribbling the ball was time-consuming and not worthwhile, they changed to counter-jumping passes, avoiding many interceptions by the opponent. The positions taken by Huang Zuode, Zhong Ling, and Chen Zanyin were extremely flexible. Each pass and catch showed their skill, and the shooting accuracy was also reported to be accurate. Zhong Ling was forced to leave the field with four fouls, and South China took the opportunity to pursue closely, but South China's remaining power was not quelled, and they finally won.</p>
<p>South China's defeat was purely due to a lack of sustained strength. All the team members can be said to have done their duty. Lu Enjing's defense was effective and his contribution cannot be overstated. He won every rebound. As for Jie Min, Chen Xinqiu, Shi Zhizhi, etc., they were especially brilliant in the first half, but their performance gradually declined in the second half, and the line of defense was messy. South China took the opportunity to penetrate deep into their territory, so they lost after winning, and were eventually suppressed by South China.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the game, the situation was calm. When South China's Huang Zuode scored a free throw and opened the scoring, both sides scored afterwards, making it eight to seven. When it was thirteen to thirteen, the situation gradually became tense. When South China's Chen Xinqiu and Shi Zhida scored baskets one after another, they took the lead with a score of twenty-one to thirteen and twenty-five to seventeen. Until the end of the half, South China lost with a score of nineteen to twenty-five.</p>
<p>Changing ends and fighting again, Huang Zuode and Chen Zanyuan suddenly revealed their sharp edges and continued to catch up, creating a tie of thirty-one to thirty. Afterwards, South China sailed smoothly, repeatedly scoring from the side or pushing the ball in under the basket in graceful poses, again achieving a score of forty-one to thirty-six. When Zhong Ling was four-fouled and left the field, South China's defense became even more eventful. The two sides again tied at forty-three to forty-three. Afterwards, South China still took the lead by one or two points all the way until the end of the game, finally winning with a score of fifty to forty-eight.</p>
<p>In the last game, the Grade B Chunfeng team faced Lingying. The two teams were originally strong teams in Grade B, but Lingying was not outstanding last night and was defeated by Chunfeng with a score of thirty-seven to fifty-five.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>(Four minutes) South China advances and attacks, encircling the Sing Hwa defense, but Chenggui and others' separate attacks are ineffective. Huitang shoots, but it goes over the crossbar.</p>
<p>(Eight minutes) Sing Hwa is still ravaged by South China, busy parrying. Guangsen dribbles on the border, Zhaorong responds on the right, a quick pass, and Tang shoots into the net from the crowd with lightning speed, making the score 1 to 0. Spectators call it a wonderful skill.</p>
<p>(Twelve minutes) Liwu once led the team to counterattack, jumping high and shooting, with considerable momentum, but it fell out of bounds. In the blink of an eye, Haizhu cleverly passed through many barriers and crossed the ball, which swept past the goal, and Yuehan was half a step late, missing a good opportunity.</p>
<p>(Fifteen minutes) Shuiyi gets a pass from Jingxiang, enters the left road and fires a cold shot, almost hitting the bullseye. Then, South China returns with a vengeance, Zhaorong turns and shoots in the smoky dust, but Baiye catches it with both hands and kicks the ball out of danger.</p>
<p>(Nineteen minutes) Zhaohan kicks the ball in the defense, his footwork is not good, and the "bullet" falls in front of the city. Jiaping sees the forward charging and punches the ball out. Liwu is too late, and the ball is obtained by Zhan Shi, who quickly passes it to Guocai. Guocai grits his teeth and shoots fiercely, missing the goal by an inch. The South China players breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>(Thirty-two minutes) Sing Hwa is besieged, struggling desperately to break through, taking advantage of the gap and attacking. Shaohan is eager to save the ball, mistakenly supporting Guocai with his back when Guocai jumps high to head the ball, causing Guocai to fall to the ground and be penalized with a penalty kick. Chenggui shoots the ball into the net before the referee blows the whistle, which is invalid. He is ordered to shoot again. Sing Hwa then appoints Yuehan to take the penalty, but his footwork is inaccurate, and the ball hits Jiaping's body, losing a sure-win opportunity.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>(Five minutes) South China leads by one to zero, feeling secure, and attacks as a defense. The Sing Hwa players want to recover the lost ground and perform better than before, attacking several times, but without success.</p>
<p>(Seven minutes) Haizhu passes a wonderful ball, and Liwu and Ren Shi double-charge. Jiaping punches the ball out again, resulting in a corner kick, wonderful!</p>
<p>(Eighteen minutes) Yuehan and Guocai switch positions, getting a pass from Chenggui and advancing along the border. When the opportunity arises, Liwu is half a step late, missing the opportunity to break through.</p>
<p>(Twenty-three minutes) South China continues to attack, shooting continuously. When Guowei throws a high ball, Jingxiang gets a chance to kick, and "A Dou" rotates into the net from the corner of the goal, beautifully clear, (two to zero) the victory is secured.</p>
<p>(Thirty-three minutes) Tired birds know to return, and spectators leave their seats one after another, the sound of fish swimming in the water [unclear] Xiang passes the ball [unclear] the ball falls in front of Lusen, who shoots from there, hitting the bullseye again, making the score three to zero. South China triumphs.</p>

<h3>Today's Match Against Hong Kong Selection</h3>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. today, Sing Hwa will play for the second time, facing the Hong Kong Interport team from the Philippines. The venue is still Jia Mountain. The Hong Kong team's lineup is impeccable, especially the forwards are complete. Gao Shanlu is also listed, recalling that in the Hong Kong-Philippines interport match, Gao took the lead, attacking and defending and transporting supplies, and was even more outstanding. Spectators applauded, saying that this gentleman has returned to his former bravery. In the recent important football finals, such as the Governor's Cup and the Lihua Cup, Gao did not appear. Whether he can show his skills today will only be known at the time. Huitang, not tired after yesterday's fierce battle, will take command again, leading the heroic army to battle.</p>
<p>However, Hou Chengtou's foot injury has not healed, so he may not play and will be replaced by Yi Shilan Zhi. Also, it was discovered yesterday that someone was secretly selling fake tickets. Please pay attention, spectators.</p>

<h3>On School Sports in Hong Kong (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>(5) On Group Activities</p>
<p>Students in general schools are trapped in schools as small as birdcages. From morning to night, they are subjected to knowledge indoctrination. In fact, every student's mind is extremely fatigued. If there are no other activities to regulate them, they may become as docile as pigs, unable to raise any activities or even mention them. The only way to solve this problem is to promote group activities. The Ministry of Education has issued orders to all education departments to forward them to all schools for compliance. Every Saturday afternoon, there are two to three hours of extracurricular activities. All faculty and students are mobilized – suburban trips, mountain climbing, or suburban gatherings, etc. Such activities can regulate the lives of students and teachers, cultivate the habit of group living, and foster the spirit of hard work and endurance, and train a strong physique to achieve the goal of popularizing sports. It is hoped that schools should hold them once or several times every week or month. Moreover, under such activities, teachers can also gain a lot of insights about students. Things that cannot be seen in school can also be seen at this time, so that deeper guidance can be given.</p>
<p>(6) Past Athlete Sports</p>
<p>The reason why Chinese sports have not been popularized for thousands of years and have fallen behind is mostly because the purpose of sports was misunderstood in the past, resulting in the failure to obtain the true effect of sports training. Only a group of nondescript glory-seeking athletes lacking cultivation were produced. Therefore, the failure of sports in the past lies in this point, and they do not know that athletes are a special product of popular sports. This is because most people are too farsighted and cannot see the foundation of athletes (popular sports training).</p>
<p>School sports in Hong Kong still suffer from this problem, only paying attention to the training of school athletes, using them to show off, and treating them like stores selling advertisements. I think it is especially shameful that some sports instructors want to use athletes to show off and "buy athletes" to participate in various glory-seeking competitions regardless of personality. I hope with all my heart that comrades who are responsible for sports education should be able to break the concept of athlete sports in the past. Future athletes should be produced from popular sports – only when sports training can be popularized can we talk about athlete training. Athlete training must be based on character (sportsmanship).</p>
<p>(7) Precious School Sports Associations</p>
<p>What I call a precious school sports association does not have any other side effects. Regardless of whether it is organized now or in the future, or who initiates it, if it can be truly organized for the improvement and development of school sports, and is rich in service spirit and the ability to keep up with the times, it can be said to be a "precious" sports association. Conversely, if it is "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton", only organized for one's own glory-seeking (self-interest), and does not benefit school sports, it cannot be considered a precious school sports association. It can only be said to be a glory-seeking association. So my last shout is still hoping that schools in Hong Kong can have a true sports association that serves school sports.</p>
<p>In summary, school sports in general in Hong Kong are still lagging behind. If we want to develop them to achieve the goal of educating the country through sports and meet the needs of extraordinary times, we must focus on popularizing sports, eliminate all athlete sports, improve the methods of athlete training, break the bad habit of buying athletes, improve the level and status of sportsmanship, respect the academic qualifications, experience, and personality of sports instructors, and have an organized school sports association with a service spirit and ability to lead the schools. They should also make use of various environments to promote lively calisthenics and group activities.</p>

<h3>Lesson of Blood</h3>
<p>— Lin Fu</p>
<p>Our heroic resistance against Japan has lasted twenty-one months. During this period, whether on the front lines or in the rear, soldiers and civilians have exerted great strength, using their blood to write the most glorious national epic. This will be forever remembered in the hearts of Chinese sons and daughters.</p>
<p>What does the lesson of blood teach us?</p>
<p>[1] Comparison of mortality rates.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of the war, the ratio of casualties in the Battle of Shanghai was five to one. Six months later, at the Battle of Xuzhou, it changed to two to one. Another six months later, during the Battle of Wuhan, there was another change, becoming one to one. In the most recent phase of the war, we have adopted new tactics, and this comparison has undergone even more astonishing changes. One Chinese soldier can now take down five Japanese soldiers; however, the situation in the Second War Zone is even more different, with a ratio of one to fourteen and a half! From the comparison of these statistics, we can see that:</p>
<p>A. China's combat techniques have made significant progress during the war.</p>
<p>B. If we resolutely continue the resistance, the collapse of the Japanese is evident and will come soon.</p>
<p>[2] The power of the masses has grown in the war.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the war, the people had not actively participated in the resistance. For example, when we were fighting in the Chenjiahang-Jiading-Changshu area, the relationship between the military and civilians was not well established. However, soon after, when we twice participated in operations in Xiaoshan and Yidu, Zhejiang, the situation was different. All the work of delivering food, transporting ammunition, and supporting the wounded was undertaken by the people spontaneously. By the time we reached Dingyuan, Guo Yang, and Mengcheng in Anhui, the spirit of the people was even stronger. Many guerrilla teams, transportation teams, rescue teams, and reconnaissance teams were organized to cooperate with the army in combat. This is clearly more progressive. As the war zone expands, the power of the masses becomes easier to harness.</p>
<p>[3] Shattered the illusion of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The initial attempt of the Japanese was to win without fighting, but we fought without surrendering. The Japanese wanted a quick victory, but we insisted on protracted resistance. The Japanese then released peace feelers, but this could not shake our determination to resist. Now the Japanese are singing the song of a century-long war, but all the Chinese children who refuse to be slaves will expel the entire Japanese from our land. This war will never stop!</p>
<p>The protracted national war is not limited by time or space. We must follow the instructions of the supreme leader and strive for military supremacy and ultimate victory. This is the most urgent and fundamental task at present.</p>
<p>February 8, 1939, from the China Salvation Drama Troupe</p>
<h3>Sent from Afar to Wuhan</h3>
<p>— Hu Weizhou</p>
<p>On the way from Kowloon Tsim Sha Tsui Station to Tai Po, I unexpectedly saw vehicles marked "Canton-Hankou Railway," which reminded me of my dear friend Wuhan, with whom I had shared hardships three years ago.</p>
<p>At this moment, strands of old dreams climbed into my heart, like the overflowing Yangtze River, no longer able to suppress the yearning, bitterness, and myriad emotions of my three years of wandering in Wuhan! What is Wuhan like after our separation?</p>
<p>It was nine years ago, on a summer night when an electric fan blew hot air, that me and my friends were strolling along the Bund in the Japanese Concession, hoping to catch a breath of fresh air by the river. But "whack!"—a burning slap suddenly struck the face of a stranger next to us, followed by..."Piggy, get out!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this "pig" character took on pig-like qualities and retaliated with a "whack!" of its own. As a result, the startled police screamed like ghosts. In the end, they couldn't catch the "piggy" but caught the three of us "suspects" who were "walking together."</p>
<p>But who can deny that we are "piggies"? A year later, I fell in love with a girl there. She loved to paint and often asked me to help her carry her equipment to Boya Terrace, Hongshan Park, or the edge of East Lake to paint the scenery she loved. I loved to read Goethe's poetry and would bring a collection with me to the mountains and spend half a day reading.</p>
<p>However, I also lingered at the crossroads of Jianghan Road and Zhongshan Road; I also listened to the distant whistles of the numerous yarn factories on the opposite bank in front of the Jianghan Customs House. I also remember the tears I shed in the autumn twilight when I parted with that girl in a state of hunger. But who sympathized with this separation?</p>
<p>After that—in the storm of December the year before last—I crawled out of the blockade of Shanghai, which had fallen, like a rat, crossed the three major railways, and accidentally set foot in Wuhan again. But in just a few hours, I still felt faint and suffocated, and my heart kept telling me that someone was whipping me, "I still need you here!" It was as if I was being forced to leave, counting the length of the Canton-Hankou Railway as I walked away. A bird's-eye view of Wuhan was imprinted in my mind again—a scene almost identical to the one before, with people still maintaining a facade of leisure.</p>
<p>Another year passed. Just when I was hating the inexplicable fall of Guangzhou, I heard the thunderous news of the destruction of Greater Wuhan, which made it impossible for me to shake off the image of the majestic posture of the three towns of Wuhan and the more than one million Hubei people whose accents I knew so well. Ah!</p>
<p>Wuhan, I offer you a sincere heart and entrust the south wind to send it to your spirit, as a distant condolence from your friend.</p>
<p>On the way back to Tai Po, I again encountered the "Canton-Hankou Railway" vehicle standing there, as if mourning and lamenting to me: Wuhan University on the towering Mount Luojia has been destroyed! The magnificent Yellow Crane Tower ××××××, the Hanyang Arsenal, the Daye Iron and Steel Plant, everything has been burned down! This is a calamity of the barbarians thousands of times worse than the flood eight years ago! But Wuhan, don't grieve. Those rude young friends of yours in those days are now gathering back together. At this moment, you are just like my fate five years ago when I was ravaged by the Japanese, but I have not died after all, and I am still working here vigorously. So we will eventually have a reunion day.</p>
<h3>Calloused Iron Palms</h3>
<p>— He Chengjiang</p>
<p>Don't underestimate these calloused iron palms!</p>
<p>Only calloused iron palms</p>
<p>Have the strength of steel.</p>
<p>They can pick up a plow to till the fields,</p>
<p>Producing a lot of food!</p>
<p>They can pick up an ax to chop wood,</p>
<p>Building many houses!</p>
<p>They can pick up a wooden oar,</p>
<p>To row the boat across the stormy ocean...</p>
<p>Calloused iron palms, calloused iron palms!</p>
<p>Have clenched their guns in response to the call to resist Japan.</p>
<p>They have also not abandoned their</p>
<p>Plows, axes, wooden oars...</p>
<p>They pick up whatever they need to do at the time,</p>
<p>Who wants to deprive them of their freedom and lock them up?</p>
<p>They will kill whoever tries! Without mercy!</p>
<p>They want to produce, they want to build, they want to defend their homes!</p>
<p>Ah! How great! Calloused iron palms!</p>
<h3>Between Humans and Beasts</h3>
<p>— Chunfeng</p>
<p>There is a saying in the Notes from the Submerged Chamber:</p>
<p>"Mr. Liangxi said that once one falls into the trap of wealth and lust, one becomes a beast."</p>
<p>The difference between humans and beasts does not seem far, just as the Western proverb says, the outside of paradise is hell. As for why falling into the trap of wealth and lust leads to becoming a beast, the reason is not given. There is another saying in the Records of Meifeng:</p>
<p>"Following reason leads to sages, indulging in desire leads to beasts."</p>
<p>This seems to explain a little why falling into the trap of wealth and lust leads to becoming a beast. Naturally, wealth and lust are desires. To satisfy "desire," one cares nothing for the individual, the nation, or the country. At the same time, one can disown ancestors and betray compatriots. Does this not make one a beast?</p>
<p>However, those who are obsessed with profit and desire will never admit to being beasts, just as they would argue: "We are loyal to saving the country, our attitude is upright..." At the same time, they say on the contrary: "So-and-so has never taken action in Hanoi!" The words sound pleasing, but what about the actions? Hasn't a certain proponent of peace recently moved from Hanoi to Siam? The relationship between Siam and Japan is known to the world. Bargaining with mysterious figures like Doihara in Siam will probably not encounter any more setbacks, not to mention that there is Tokyo beyond Siam. But even if they openly run to Tokyo! They will still deny the name of advocating peace. The mouth is such a wonderful and versatile thing. The ancient Jewish king Solomon once wrote a book called Proverbs, with a chapter saying:</p>
<p>"There are three things that I cannot fathom, and four that I do not know: the way of an eagle in the air, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship in the sea, and the way of a man with a woman. The way of an adulteress is also like this: she eats and wipes her mouth, and says, 'I have done no wrong.'"</p>
<p>In fact, if Solomon, that great sage, knew today, he should add one more beastly way to the list of incomprehensible things. Their strong arguments can indeed be equated with the other four.</p>
<p>There is a passage in Issues 7 and 8 of Guoxun that is well worth reading, titled "A Record of a Conversation with Li Zongren," in which there is a discussion of those who advocate peace:</p>
<p>"Those who advocate peace are probably not sincere... There are two reasons why they have different intentions and make some fallacious arguments to deceive the world. The first reason is that they are mostly refined people who cannot withstand the horror of war. They become flustered when planes circle over their heads a few times... The second is that they are opportunists who always want to rely on something to stand out... The advocacy of peace is just a trick, and politics is at play in its essence."</p>
<p>This passage can be used to further explain the previous opinion that "indulging in desire leads to becoming a beast." Mr. Li Zongren is a military man, but his insights are more penetrating than those of scholars.</p>
<h3>Review of "Wartime Japan" Issue 6 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>Japan denies that it intends to close the door to China or exclude the interests of third parties in order to deceive and lie to countries with interests in China. In fact, Japan has been carrying out extremely rapid economic aggression in our occupied territories. Here, Mr. Dong Min's article, "Economic Aggression under Japan's 'Localism,'" is the most informative. From this, we know that Japan has seized the various sectors of industry among its spoils, classifying and planning for many new plunder plans. The evidence of this "economic aggression" proves Japan's true purpose in invading China and exposes all of Japan's deception and lies, which can correct erroneous international views.</p>
<p>Mr. Song Feiru's serialized "On the Essence of the Japanese Empire" is a work explaining the essence of the Japanese Empire. This issue's section, "Cultivation Forms after the Meiji Restoration," helps to fully point out Japan's semi-feudal nature based on the "Land Ownership Relationship" described in the previous issue. Using abundant materials, it points out the semi-feudal nature of the land economy after the capitalist revolution. It first explains the characteristics of cultivated land ownership, and then points out that in terms of land rent, rent in kind is still a common form, and corvée rent has not yet been eliminated. Money rent, which is the basic form of land rent in capitalist society, is extremely uncommon in Japan. However, in terms of "public rent," due to coercion, it "sheds the form of rent in kind and transforms into the form of money rent." This is a "military stipulation," by which "one can grasp the military nature and semi-serf nature of Japanese capitalism." This serialized work is the greatest achievement in studying Japanese socioeconomics.</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's invasion of Hainan Island, there are two commentaries by Mr. Chunzhen and Mr. Feiru, pointing out its impact on our resistance and the international community. Related to this issue is Mr. Xu Zhuoying's article, "The 'Philippines' under the Threat of Japan's Southern Advance."</p>
<p>Regarding "Sketches of Japanese Women," the main focus of the issue, there are three articles: Mr. Chen Xunzhi's "A Female Political Prisoner," Mr. Jian Mo's "Kyoko Marries a Legless Wounded Soldier," and a Tokyo dispatch, "The Wartime Colors of Japanese Women." Mr. Yi San's short commentary, "Japan's Pink Policy," points out the inhumanity of the Japanese military's coercion of women.</p>
<p>Continuing and unfinished works include articles by Mr. Si Mu and Mr. Lin Huanping. The former describes the dangerous fate of wartime Japanese laborers and their resistance to the Japanese warlike government, while the latter narrates the growth of the Japanese Communist Party and its activities during the war.</p>

<h3>The Snow of Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Do you want me to force you to leave?"</p>
<p>"Whatever."</p>
<p>So, he pressed the gun against her back, forcing her to move forward. But she conveniently hugged the electric welder next to her, turned her head, and looked at him indifferently,(Hole)ing him. She knew that he could be indulged now, at least within the limits of not endangering his safety, and she would always be safe. He was furious, raised the gun, aimed it at her head, and threatened:</p>
<p>"I'm going to shoot!"</p>
<p>"I didn't hold your hand either, shoot!"</p>
<p>"Okay, close your eyes!"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid! I want to see your skills!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm not leaving, kill me!"</p>
<p>Her persistence in this determination finally made the gun he once relied on to solve all problems lose its dignity and authority.</p>
<p>Night came. The night sky could not hide the color of the snow. The road, the rooftops, the tops of the walls were still white. Wherever there was snow, it was white; even the thread of snow left on the branches was white. The nights of Manchuria in winter can be said to be mysteriously white.</p>
<p>If there were painters to paint this night scene in Manchuria, they would have to bring a lot of white paint, otherwise they would feel a lack in the complete set of paints, or almost everything besides white would be superfluous. Red is also essential now, let the painters bring more of it; because now the snow in Manchuria is often red - the blood of the people of Manchuria, the fate of the people of Manchuria, needs the painter's red expression!</p>
<p>If there are singers from Manchuria, let them sing a song about snow. This song will tell people about the beauty of the scenery and the beautiful and alluring snow; the memory of snow, the dream of snow, can also make people's souls (Hole) wander (Hole) - the memory of snow is bitter, but unforgettable. This song will tell people many stories of snow, the characters in the stories; he and she are also among them.</p>
