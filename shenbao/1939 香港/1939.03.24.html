<h3 id="c1">希特勒第二次計劃 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>前日各報登載倫敦「新聞紀錄報」所揭露希特勒第二次計劃的內容，有三點値得注意：（一）希特勒此後將要公開提出要求的對象，已不獨限於東歐，範圍已普遍於整個歐洲，甚至於涉及菲洲：（二）德國的侵略對象已不能局限於歐洲諸小國，它已顯明要侵犯英法的領土；（三）希特勒此後不但要爲自己計劃，並且要爲他的帮兇意大利打算。當此歐洲正在「山雨欲來風滿樓」的時候，對於這個第二次計劃，我們應有深刻的認識。茲略抒所見如下：</p>
<p>（一）這個第二次計劃更顯明表露希特勒的侵略是無止境的。去年九月間英法當局對希特勒的估量，是分割捷克一部分領土，是日耳曼民族的自决。但曾幾何時，德國竟吞併了整個捷克，現在德軍的槍已經描對着羅馬尼亞，並且已大舉向在普魯士與立陶宛邊境的殷斯達堡及狄斯將二鎭開調。據歐洲一般人的推測，德吞併立陶宛的危機現已迫在眉睫，波蘭也已在提心弔胆了。希特勒還計劃鼓煽各國國社黨起而嚮應，幷煽動法國的革命。「納粹」的反動是帶着國際性，在這裏可以充分認識了。如果希特勒的侵略在東歐得到完全的成功，相信他反戈以攻英法，擾亂整個的歐洲，甚而至全世界，爲時並不甚遠。「英雄的民族」，自然有它的去向。</p>
<p>（二）希特勒還要嗾使他的帮兇意大利，對英法提出要求，牽制英法，以便利他的侵畧。希特勒並不是根本愛護意大利，但因目前自己的基礎未鞏固，還需要臭氣相投的國家，做他的帮手。所以在第二次計劃中極力替慕索里尼向英法討價。希特勒這樣作風，旣可以討好慕索里尼，又可以對英法示威，要英法放手不干涉他在東歐的橫行。倫敦電訊又傳慕索里尼將於下星期日作驚人的演說，一般預料這次演說或將成爲燃點下次事變的火把。同時又傳希特勒將於慕索里尼演說之前先作一種支撐意大利要求的姿勢。兩個侵略者狼狽爲好的內情，已經可以明瞭了。</p>
<p>（三）希特勒恐怕還要支撑東方的侵略者，旣可以牽制英法，又可以威脅美蘇。德意日最近的胃險行動，都是出於共謀。當柏林德意日三國軍事外交聯席會議開會不久，意大利卽極力帮助佛郎哥軍隊進逼至法國邊境，東方的侵畧者也於同時佔領了海南島。當時報紙曾傳希特勒要求日本在太平洋上威脅英法。一切陰謀皆爲事實所揭穿。現在希特勒正是有事於東歐的時候，蘇聯對於各小國的支持相當積極，相信希特勒還要嗾使日本積極向北滿及北洋進出，以牽制蘇聯——雖說日本的牽制不會有效果。或許幾次爲希特勒所巧妙利用過的日本，最近反要乘西歐多事的機會，積極謀以軍事行動急速結束中日大戰，也未可知。那末，日軍在華中華南的軍事蠢動，或者更有可能。</p>
<p>（四）最後，我們更應深刻認識的，希特勒雖然發動了「納粹十字軍的東征」，但是德國的實力尙不允許他認眞爆發一個第二次世界大戰。論德國的準備和實力尙不及歐戰前多多，英法雖然脆弱，但在侵畧者的進逼超過一限度時，倒反可以逼使英法聯結蘇聯及其他各小國，對希特勒作强硬抵抗。希特勒今日所能用的是手勢，而不是眞打。所以希特勒第二次計劃的實施，恐怕還有多少時候。近日世界民主國家因爲希特勒的狂暴，倒反顯示着更加密切聯結可能的傾向。英國已向蘇聯提出共同對德的提議。雖說英蘇同盟未必馬上實現，歐洲六國會議未必立郎召集成功，但是英蘇爲共同對付德國計，拋棄二十年來彼此的猜忌，視希特勒的進迫程度如何，不是沒有可能的。六强宣言之發出也有充分的可能性。德意的胃險行爲，都是利用着英法與蘇聯之間的矛盾，並且輕視英法的懦弱，如果英法能捐棄對蘇聯的猜忌而採進一步的聯結，同時又能對希特勒還以一個有力量的手勢，德意的進一步的胃險行動，恐怕會暫時停止。</p>
<p>此後的發展關鍵完全在於英法蘇及歐洲諸小國能否聯結成一氣。其最主要的動力在於英法。蘇聯建議召集歐洲六國會議，聯合組織「反希特勒集團」，據各方推測，當然是出於誠意。但是倫敦傳出消息，却謂：「英國將否出任領導地位，以完成對德之包圍，端視各小國的態度而定。」這是可悲觀的現象。</p>
<p>現在是英國爭取領導權的最好機會。日本雖然在北洋及北滿調兵遣將，但對蘇作戰似尙非其時，昨日日本外相有田還吐露漁約可以圓滿解决的消息。美國對於國社黨活動之國際化，並且深入美洲，已有深切的戒愼。英國能對美蘇表示誠意，自可不動一兵而制止希特勒的狂妄。英國能否握住歐洲的領導權，倒反要看他能否在東歐及巴爾幹維護正義！</p>
<h3 id="c2">七種致命的痼疾 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 宋美齢</p>
<p>如果當我們的國家，眞正能專心致志地着手於內部的淸除和整理，使她像一間屋子那樣卉得秩然有序，那末不要多少時間，就可以在那些擦得又光又亮的像具上反映出我們民族的本來面目來。因爲渴欲看到這光明的場面，我就受這種愛國慾望的驅使，願意在這個全盤淸除的服役中，盡我一分的心力，並且不願忌諱的把那黑暗的角落，公開的在陽光底下展露開來，當然有許多人寗願內陋就簡，諱疾忌醫，可是爲了國家的光榮，爲了使國家進步而有秩序，我們就不能有所顧忌而要負起我們應盡的義務。</p>
<p>我們所需要的是國家組織化。其實這也並不難，祗要驅除那此　蔽我們眼睛，阻碍我們政治社會進展的那些惡劣習俗，組織化就立刻會見諸實現的。</p>
<p>首外要提出來說明的是一派別觀念」。這似乎處處都支配　我們的活動。這種觀念植根　常之深，任何大小事業都被它阻滯了而不能　展。有了派別觀念的人他就不以事業成敗爲前提，而以派別異同爲前提，假使　一個人，是屬於他們派別以外的，不論這一個人能力如何充分，大家總是千方百計阻止他不能到自己團體裏來獲得位置，因此就產生了因私誤公的壤現象。凡是思想人格自由獨立的人才，他總是不肯貶損目己來依附求容的，於是那些專重派別的分子，因爲他沒有加入自己的派別而却在自已的左右　事，就一定加以　擠，或間接設法使他不能安於其職。因之每一個派別都是濫竽充數者的牧谷所。它培植了腐化和退步，養成了猜忌和携貳，產生了卑怯和自私，結果不但使國家步步退化，還加增了國家無益的負担。總之在派別觀念中，沒有團結和互助，祗有烏合之衆的直覺與行動。</p>
<p>其次是缺乏自制能力，他的遺害也相彷彿。這種惡劣習慣的養成，其根本原囚，由於學校的缺乏精神敎育，或係由於居官者沒有做出良好的表率。不論它的原因何在，這總是跛形的症象。學生在學校的時候，沒有受到偉大精神的啟導長成以後　何會知道應怎樣去戰勝惡劣環境而不受其其移默化呢？凡是不知道或沒有能力控制自身行動的人們，必定是對於國家利益澳不相關，或者竟是全不知道國民的　任而不惜做出貽害國家的錯　行動。至於身負政治責任的長官，如果缺乏了自己管制自己的能力，就可以逐級影到響他們的部屬，即使卑微到一個管門人都會上行下效，醉生夢死，它像酸素那樣，腐蝕了整個國家的織維。</p>
<p>逃避責任——這一個痼疾，也是一般人通有的可恥病症。在公務員間其害實等於犯罪，這就是俗語所說的一推出去完事」，也是從前官場中普遍常有的積習。長官們很熟習地用一種　乎本能的極度機巧的手段來　卸實任，一切都可以「不關我事」這是外國人所最不能瞭解的一種中國特性。廿原因一部份也是由於好「面子」觀念的關係，不推諉一番似乎是損害了對方的一面子」，自已做不好受人家批評，又是自己失了「面子」。而重要關鍵還在於愚昧無知，缺乏治事能力，沒有人格或者簡直是不惜公然阻碍事業的進行。這一個習氣影嚮十分遠人。各種事業的推行和進展，尤其是經濟方面，都因之而沉滯落後了。</p>
<p>因逃避責什而阻滯了各種天然資源的開發，其程度之甚，簡直不可以數字計算。有了這一個壞習氣，許多實業興交通的計劃，都被擱置了許許多多關於文化以及其他的建議，原足以改良人民精神與物質生活的，也因之而未見實行。如果有什麽事情原來已經是頭緒紛繁的，因爲往返推諉的　故，就更加混亂。事情旣沒法進展，責任就更不分明。實際上，那些規避責任者誰是應當負中國退化的罪疚，將來我們的子孫書寫這時期歷史的時候他們會淸淸楚楚地辨別出來。」可措這種應受的公正判斷和實罰僅是以後的而不是目前的了。這種逃避實任的人，像前文所說的那樣　木般堆積在官　裏面，幾乎每一個公務機關裏面的聯員錄上都擠瀟了這些不爲生產的朽木，推原開始，固然由於少數人的作崇，然而上行下効，那些偶或對國事不肯負責的人們，影響所及，就會造成許許多多無恥的羣衆，這種羣衆，我們祇可名之爲一吃箱不管事』的大軍。這個大軍裏的官長與士兵，太沒有做專的能力了——他們的高級長官旣沒有骨氣，更沒有天良去革除而他們雖然素　尸位，接受不應得之報酬絲毫無動於中，揚揚然還自以爲得計，人民無數血汗，原可作適當用途以聘請有才有能的人去推進國家事業的多方面的進展的，竟然寃寃枉枉地如此消耗了，豈不可痛！</p>
<p>復次，還有所謂自暴自棄的痼習，常常從「沒有法子」那句陰鬱的話裏表選了出來。這句話是什麽意義呢？這永遠是不算責任，冷漠，懶惰，無能，以及做一件新穎或重要事情時，想鄙陋地逃避困難及職責的藉口。這也是拿破侖所謂他子典中所沒有的字眼。這也是滿清官史用來　除進步有爲者的法寶，因爲他們知道接受了那些緊能之士，他們自已的地位就將發生動搖。其　等於「不可能」，「幹不了」，從前各衛門常可聽到這個習語。到今天這個非常時期，還聽見這一個聲浪的迴邊，實在是我們的恥辱。目前這時期，正是我們希望用來作爲不久將來完全改革一切不司恕惡習。而用以保護我們免受各種致命毒箭摧殘的一面　蕩一面建議的時期。天下事那裏會「沒有法子」的，在這個非常時期，「沒有法子」也得要「有法子，」把「沒有法子」作爲口頭禪的人，就是不用心與不肯做事的代表，永遠是國家最可怕的有害分子，</p>
<p>再次我們還有一種惡習，卽所謂「差不多」，這是那些媽媽虎虎，隨隨便便和懶情人們嘴上常有的話。其意卽缺少正確性。等於「就這樣罷」算了，所差有限。」它是籠統含　的人們言語間最　的詞令，也是　俗浮沉，模梭兩可者的術語。在最需要　確的機器製造廠裏，它是莫大的危險；它不　對於一正磁可靠』那一個近來事業或功的要素宣吿了死刑。它所造成的許多轡處之中，我們可以看到的，像如絲茶商業的失敗，因爲「差不多」，結果樣品不可靠，製造裝運都不講究。你不是聽見那些　絲的人們說道：」這裏有些是壤蘭子；」負責管理的人爲貪圖省事就接着說「差不多算了罷；」可是在很遠很遠的外國，却有人在說：「這種絲，品質不勻毫無用處，我們下次不再買它了。」這是「差不多」給我們的恩惠，不僅是絲茶出品是如此，還有許多其他方面的事業都同樣受到了損害。</p>
<p>上面已經把我們七種致命的痼疾次第說明了。除，此以外還有幾種壤處我們也不能忽視。比如像忌婊，偏狹，這一類的壞處都是要不得的。這些壞處雖然在世界上體便那個地方都可以找到。但在我們中國由於凡事都缺乏效率的原故，更是長遠的危害着國家。我們有些時候小事很聰明，大事却很糊塗；國家需要的東西，我們選購的時候，也常常發生心理上和道德上的偏見和邪妄：并且常常忘掉或不願意遵守規例。有些人自己處於發號施令的地位，卻沒有想想自己是不是已經遵守那些法令，同時有人犯了這些法令他們也沒有認眞辯理，這要算是頂壞的事情。一種違法的事在別的地方通常是看得很重的，但在我們中國則似乎不必認眞。</p>
<p>我們平常和外人交涉的時候也有兩個重要的缺點。第一件便士常常派一個門外漢談判技術上的合同，第二件是用學識不夠語言不很精通的人來當翻譯。因爲字義弄不清楚和語言上的不能十分融合，這當中所發生的誤解是可以想像得出的，他們有好些愚蠢而嚴重的錯誤，說起來也不曾有人相信，但我却曉得眞有那樣的事，大家認爲可以勝任翻譯的人也不免　著令人不能相信的錯誤，這一類的故　我實在題得很多一，要不是這些錯誤　得　嚴重，說起來倒也是可以令人發笑的　。</p>
<p>過去我們和外人談判經濟計劃，常常不得結果，並且大家都覺得不十分痛快；其原因可以說大牛發生於祖任翻譯者的能力不够。我們將來和外人舉行重要談判的時候，怎樣免去這一種完　不必要的隔　和容易發生困雞的原因，是值得嚴重考慮的一件事。</p>
<p>我們和外人討論或談判財政經濟或工業計劃的時候，只有完全　習技術名詞的人　可以用他來當翻譯。我們過去因爲翻譯的錯誤而受的損失，眞是沒有方法來計算。我們中國很可以由若干計劃或問題的談判成功而得到利益，已經過去的事我們可以不必管它，却沒有理由說以後再應該照樣受這一種因誤會而起的不愉快的損失。凡是負責談判的人都應該俱有般高的需要條件，最豐富的學識，最高尙的牲格，最充分的理解力，和　健全的想像力。在未進行談判之先，他們應該考究怎樣才可以成功雙方都認爲滿　的協定，就使談判失敗的時候　要說得出合法而充足的理由。對於無能的人，應加　　，以示談判失敗應有的合理處分。以前，因爲談判者未能從中漁利，往往使協定不成。這也是我們應當從　革除而防將來重復出現的壞現象。</p>
<p>假如我在上面所舉的這些痼疾和惡習慣都除去了，或者改過了那麽最近國民參政會决議的國民精神動員案也就立刻可以由理見諸實行了。同時，所有逃避實任，假公濟私，和有荒職守的罪惡，都應該把他列爲「　國」行爲，讓大家一看見便知道應該一爲國民所共棄一、</p>
<p>上面這些缺點綜合起來，使我們國家多少年都沒有長進。現在我們已經看出了解救的方法，我　信只要我們能够拿出堅定的毅力來，一定可以把這些汚點完全免掉，其實這些汚點眞非趕快滌除不可，我們旣已知道了解救的方法；這些痼疾當然就不難療治，現在眞是我們除舊更新和教亡圖存的唯一的時機了。愛國心　民族自尊心　使着我們全國國民，卽使是其中很懦弱　漫不經心的分子，都不能不醒悟過來，勇往積極的站起來，以我們自立更生的雄姿和行動，響應着這個永遠繚於我們心弦上的宏遠的巨響，這麽簡動有力的一個字Rersurga——我將再生」我顧我們民族四萬五千萬同胞人人都發出「我將再生」的堅決的呼聲，以吐聲音演成功力量，以此聲音　起行動，　成我們「中華民族的復興」！</p>
<h3 id="c3">苦戰中的上海青年　二期抗戰宣傳週青年日　各界青年發表聯合宣言 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（上海通訊）本月　七日爲上海特別市黨部領導各界舉行抗戰宣傳之第六日。本市各界靑年，特發表聯合宣言，茲　錄如次，</p>
<p>犧牲精神</p>
<p>全市親愛的靑年們，靑年在我國革命史上一向佔着無上光榮的一頁，證以辛亥革命的推翻滿淸，民國十五六年的打倒軍閥，參加的大多數都以靑年爲主幹，這種犧牲　門的光榮　蹟，真可與吾中華民族同垂不朽，再證以前歲四　月的淞滬血戰，道接參加前綫作戰，把熱血噴濺敵人，案取相當代價，造成可歌可泣的史料，以及做各種政治的，敎育的，社會的，醫藥的工作，間接爲戰爭致力的，大多數怕還是我們各界的靑年。</p>
<p>抗戰情緒</p>
<p>現在我們身處的上海市，縱已淪爲孤島，可是我們抗戰的情緒，却隨淪陷的歲月而繼續增高，所以我們靑年隊伍中，不少已到了內地去服兵役，參加游擊隊，以及其他有利于抗戰的工作，就是留在這　島上的，也一致同仇敵愾，時刻爲抗戰建國作種種準備愛國的行動，還是繼續不斷的進行着。</p>
<p>今後目標</p>
<p>我們過去的努力，雖已有了相當的成績，可是在這國家遭逢空前國難，抗戰　入第二期時，想到國家對靑年期望的　切，靑年對國家應負責任的重大，覺得過去的眞獻，還是不免愧對國家，須知非常時期，我們每個靑年，都應有非常的作爲才是啊，因此，我們列舉三事，作爲我們今後共同努力的目標。</p>
<p>第一，擁護蔣委員長吿全國靑年書——我們要恪邀蔣委員長吿全國靑年書中詔示各點，（一）參加戰時動員——各就知能所近，盡力貢獻，應視奪門爲天職，認犧牲爲當然。（二）接受各種訓練——必要時，我們必須要到內地去受軍事訓練，以獲得保衛國族的技能和忠黨愛國的方式，更受政治訓練，以獲得建設三民主義國家所必要的政治素養。（三）促進文化建設—智識界靑年，必須自動參加掃除文盲運動，協同進行通信敎育並努力參加抗戰宜傳，使一般國民，都有正確的政治意識，和相當的文化水準。（四）推行勞動服務—體會孫　理「人生以服務爲目的」之　訓，參加社會生產等動，以發展國民經濟，同時深人民簡接近民衆，以工作成績，取得一般同胞的信仰。（五）培養生產技藝—注重科舉的修養，使意識言行一切都科學化，養成有條理有組織重精密重實踐的新的民族性，同時要接受技　訓練，養成生　和勞動的技能，使大部份靑年，得服務於農商路鑛電氣工業，使國家偉大的建設，得以加運完成。</p>
<p>第二，勵行精神總動員—我們要恪　蔣委員長製定的國民精神總動員綱領，及其實施辦法（二）認淸共同目標—集中意志，集中力量，作國家至上，民族至上，軍事第一，勝利第一的努力。（二）寶踐　園這德—對國家應其其至忠，對民族應行其大義，並演進而爲仁愛信義和平請美德。（三）確定建國信仰—確定總理手創的三民主義，爲中國建國的最高原則，使我們理想中所欲建設的國家，爲外則獨立自由平等，內則民有民治民享。（四）改造精神—改正醉生夢死的生活，養成奮發蓬勃的朝氣，革除苟且倫安的習慣，打破自私自利的企圖，和糾正紛歧錯雜的思　，（五）動員領導——依據動員實　辦法，身體力行，直接間接作不斷地推進，使在最短期間，獲得美滿的成績。</p>
<p>第三，切實實行新生——我們要恪　蔣委員長提倡的新生活運動綱領，切實實行禮義　　，要做到整齊淸潔簡　樸素八個字，因此我們必須要（一）生活軍事化——要澈底掃除過去萎　散漫，退縮，頺唐，廢弛，的風習，以養成明恥尙武刻苦耐勞愛國家重信用並尙簡單　　樸守紀律守時間等良好習慣。（二）生活藝衛化——躬務求嚴謹謙　，待人務求誠擊寬厚，處事務求迅速精到，接物務求儉約淸　。（三）生活生產化——寶金方面，要　尚節用與儲蓄，務求社會資源的增益，勞力方面，要注重　時與操作，務求量的增加和質的充實，物資方面，嬰注重國貨的　倡，務求物品的撙節與愛護，</p>

<p>意義</p>
<p>三月廿九日爲黃花崗七十二烈士殉國的紀念日、經於民國二十七年三月一日第五屆中央常務委員會議時、予以通過，三二九七十二烈十殉　的壯舉、是促成辛亥革命而奠定中華民國始基的偉大　業、</p>
<p>事薊</p>
<p>三二的經過、三二九黃花崗之役、是民國紀元前二年、廣東新軍暴動失敗後的繼續起義的、地　在廣州、其　劃起義的　機關、則設於香港、由黃　任總指揮、由謝身牧在南洋華僑募得數萬盾爲經費、起義時、黃與率領同志百餘人、曾攻入總督府、及後因粵督張嗚岐調隊圍攻、旋卽失敗、失敗後　俗更大施恐怖政策、黨人及剪髮的民衆、被捕殺甚多、然壓迫愈甚、反抗亦念烈、主義均深入民心、革命潮流、終不可過止、於是　有十月十日武昌起義的　起、以光大諸先烈未竟之遺志、而奠定中華民國之始基、</p>
<p>紀念「三二九」的任務</p>
<p>（一）要　承「三一九」革命先烈百折不　英勇奮　的精神，堅定「抗戰必勝建國必成」的信念、不苟安、不長難、抗戰到底、全國各機關各團　、　須把　花崗七十二烈士及　先烈犧牲的事實和精神、向着全線官兵全國民衆、作廣大而深入的宣傳、實施全國精神　　動員、使人人深刻認職、最後勝利必屬我國、了解「中途妥協就是滅亡」、堅定其信念、鼓勵具參加抗戰、</p>

<p>（四）革命先烈偉大認識之一、是提倡國內各民族的平等互助、目前我們的神聖抗戰、不但是全民的抗戰、而且　國內各民族團結一致的抗戰、這是就要加緊對國內少數民族的喚醒、加强國內少數民族的團結、來答復×人分化的陰謀，</p>

<p>今日本報第二版刊載蔣委員長夫人宋美齡先生所著「七種致命的　疾』一文，於說明我國七種痼疾時，持別首列『派別觀念」，並痛陳　嫉偏狹的壞處，在目前二期抗戰方將展開革侖成功　極遼遼之除，實在特別値得全國上下一致重現</p>
<p>朱先生還說：一凡是思想人格自由獨立的人才，他　　不肯貶損自己來依附求容的，于是那些專重派別的分子，因爲他沒有加入自己的派別而却在自己的左右做事，就一定加以排擠或間接設　使他　能安于其職。因之……培植了腐化和退少，養成了猜忌和携膩，產生了卑怯和自私，結果不　使國家步步退化，還祖加了國家無益的負担，總之在派別觀念中，沒有團結和互助，祗有烏合之家的直覺與　動』。這更可算是「痛切時弊」之論，我們希望當政者　之座右，以爲用人處事之誡。</p>
<p>同時我們更應進一步認淸，在今日抗戰建國這樣嚴重階段，一切忌嫉　狹和派別觀念，實足以引起內部磨　，離間全國團結，阻碍抗戰前途，間接帮助了我們的×人和漢奸；是我們所一日不能容忍的—不過要澈底　蕩這些痼疾和壞處，一方面固希望在上者以身作則，另一方面也是更重要的，却在民主法治制度的確立，特別是在今日，要把各省市縣參議會儘速成立。作爲眞正地方民意機關，因爲祗有民意獲得正常的發揮，衹有政府與民　間的聯系日漸密切，則一切　派別觀念」與忌嫉偏狹的壞處容易發見容易滌蕩。</p>
<h3 id="c31">舒斯特行記 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>一個最年輕的首都　歐洲變局的新焦點</p>
<p>吾人鑒於中歐時局的嚴重趨勢，覺得培恩，惠其渥這一篇描寫喀巴什鳥克蘭首都舒斯特的文字，是特別適台時宜的。</p>
<p>我們知道，柏林是决定把盧森尼亞重行侖名爲喀巴什烏克關了，　是中歐現狀的一個重大打離。喀巴什烏克蘭固然不是一個獨立的國家，而是捷克斯洛伐克聯邦共和國所轄的一邦，但是她却享受着廣大的自治權，而目前，更因其在國　交通上的地位，使她的自治權無形中又膨脹了許多。</p>
<p>烏克　自己覺得應當成爲由蓋列西亞，布可維那，培蔭拉比亞——還有當然是蘇維埃聯邦分裂後烏克蘭族所住的廣大區城——所成的巨大力量的基礎。烏克蘭人聲稱　人口在全世界至少有四千萬人。</p>
<p>新的首都，舒斯特，位於狹帶形的捷克　洛伐克共和國的東端，和匈牙利很相近，距雜馬尼亞邊界也不遠。</p>
<p>舒斯特顯然是一個僻處的市　，一般人所不易到達的，從地圖上看，到舒斯特最　利的道路是越過萊培山脈不遠的萊培，然後乘火車前往，所以我就先到萊培去。但是那　的，界是被封閉了。</p>
<p>從萊培走失敗囘來，我又想試走克拉可。但在那裏，我買不到往舒斯特的車票，更糟的，是我買不到捷克的銀幣，擄說因爲謠傳貨幣卽將貶値，波　銀行不冉兌換此項銀幣了。但我終於兌到了五先令，買到了一張越境到達齊里那的軍票，並叫我們到了那邊再打聽前往舒斯特的綫。</p>
<p>沒有人知道怎樣前往</p>
<p>但是，到了齊里那，天是黑了，並目還下着雨，沒有人知道怎樣到舒斯特去。因此，我就接受了同行的一位匈牙利人的勸吿，跑到布達佩斯（匈京）去，另行設去。從這裏走去，舒斯　——捷克斯洛伐克共和國治下一邦的首都——是很界易到達了，並且不經過其自己的國境，而是經過它的　敵匈牙利的首都。</p>
<p>一條向東的優越汽車路可以在五小時內把你載到克　帕，然後再乘本地火車到培萊格司薩。在那裏本來是保證可以得到一輛到舒斯特去的公共汽車的。但竟沒有，於是我就和警察商量，替我的車夫領了一張特別通行證後，坐汽車到那邊境去，無論如何，我得保持對舒斯特的公正的立場。那裏有連接斯洛戊克的國有公共汽車；屬於後者　更多。</p>
<p>這些最近所割讓掉的邊疆城市，都還帶着急切轉移其國籍的創痕。墻壁和商店的門面上都經毀傷過，凡是捷克的商號和街名都給扯去，而愛上了匈牙利的名稱。</p>
<p>臨時國界（在布達佩斯，割界委員會依然在進行其劃分那最後一線的工作）　句括兩個關口，每一關口用四輪貨車停在半街中，好像出入必經的一種門戶。在這裏有佩帶着來福槍，刺刀和望遠鏡的哨兵，在路上和空場上防守着。</p>
<p>鄉間市鎮的泥草</p>
<p>舒斯特本身是巧妙地躺在一個有許多古蹟的小山之下的。這是一個簡陋的鄉間市鎭，深深地沒踝在泥淖中，在我看來，正好像十二年前的鐵拉那政安哥拉一樣。但是在安哥拉，建築物是堅固的，　久的——在這裏，新政府的　築是用木造的。」爲什麽用木造呢』？我問。「因爲木料多』，他們說，又謂，「在故都　曹羅特，我們是用石來建　的。在這裏，或者是用木頭比較好些」。</p>
<p>喀巴什烏克蘭公開的悼惜那裏失了的國土，特別是烏曹　特和黑開司，在那裏捷克政府於慕尼黑會讓之前，曾在公共建　和學　方面濫用了許多錢。當我呈險通行證時，下面是貼着來自烏曹　特的印花的。撿驗員痛苦地把「烏　羅特」抓去了，而寫上「舒斯特」。在另一方面，匈牙利還是不　足，每夜都有無線電廣播，「我們要收復整個的失地」。</p>
<p>在舒斯特有兩個旅館，中央和可羅那。前者是一個猶太人開的，後者則是在「西克』（烏克　的納粹）統洽之下。在中央旅館裏，我們還可以看見捷克的官吏，商人，猶太人，和一般民衆。這可以稱爲是舊式的，合法的。報紙很多，使我很注意的，是那些猶太人，當新鮮報紙到來時，他們是多麽焦急的包圍着那「伏爾克可基，皮　培脫』。（報名）總統伏洛遜神甫的照片到　懸掛着，而捷克故總統麥蔭立克　照相也還懸　在中央　館裏。</p>
<p>總　的簡單家庭</p>
<p>但可羅那旅館則是舒　特的活躍生活，它的衛隊，它的　聞記者，以及它那灰藍色的「西克」制服的活動中　了。在這裏沒有麥　立克的照相，管理處裏　着可諾惠萊脫（著名的烏克蘭革命運動　袖）的照片。齊一的脚跟相碰的聲昔，在可羅那旅館裏是時常可以聽到的。「嘿』—舉着手，是普通的敬禮。和納粹的氣氛大不相同的是元伏洛遜神甫的家庭。除了　俱的　設是鄉土式的而外，他的住宅可以說是一個舒適的監理教會牧師的住宅。在客廳裏　着聖母和天父的像，旁邊是他已故夫人的像，因爲伏洛遜神甫是屬於聯合敎會的，所以做牧師的也可以結婚。總統的儀表和服飾也完全是一個監理長老的樣子，他的胸懷是開闊的，他對人是和善的。他熱烈地拒絕任何反　的　情，事實　喀巴什烏克蘭的經濟生活，巳有百分之八十　操在猶太人手裏，其人數約佔全人口的百分之十二。他們是完全效忠於國家的。</p>

<p>抗戰軍興之初我財政當局為集中財力物力、以應付×人侵略起見、會發行救國公債五萬萬元、分發國內及海外各地華橋推銷、去年夏間、國內及海外各埠多已勸募足額、辦理結束、並經財部正式通告付息、本港名額原定一千萬、但開始勸募迄今已十數月、但尚未能定額、進展之遲緩、出人意料之外、關於最近銷債成續及今後勸募計劃進行、記者昨向本港勸募分會調查、茲分綠各情如次、</p>
<p>銷債遲緩　未足定額</p>
<p>查救國公債于民廿七年十月間開始在本港勸募、由勸募分會推動勸募工作、在主任委員周禱臣爵紳等領導之下、全港僑胞踴躍認購、中下級僑胞尤爲狂熱、當時公債勸銷淮展甚速、平均每月成績達數十萬元之巨、以本港僑胞之經濟力量而言、一千萬元之公債、本來片刻可以銷完、祗以港中富豪、大多數均未徘負起其本身之責任、祗憑中下級僑胞、竭盡力量、遂致銷債進展日漸遲緩、計由　始勸　以達現在、統計成績七百六十餘萬、（此數包括公債未發行以前之各種義捐在內）、計勸銷成績以第一期爲最佳、截至民廿七年底止、　三數月之時間、已達四百餘萬、由廿七年元月起至年底止、一年內僅得二百七十餘萬元、以最初發行時之進展程度、比較遲緩得多、</p>
<p>港中富豪　出錢不多</p>
<p>銷債進展遲緩之唯一原因、卽爲有錢入之不能多出錢所致、查港中富豪之具有數百萬或千萬之資產者不知凡幾、倘此輩能本其自己良心、盡個人對國家之義務、撥出其十份一之資財以購公債則此千萬債額、轉瞬可以、銷淸、但事實并不如是、記者曾詳查購債者之題名、查悉各富豪購之數目、有出人意外之微少、卽過去之七百餘萬成績、大部份亦爲集中多數勞苦大衆下級僑胞所得、至於長期購債、亦唯有勞苦大衆努力、富有者一次過購債後、卽算完却資任、以實際情形言之、誠足使人痛心、苦以現目銷債七百餘萬成績而言、及過去一年來銷債二百七十餘萬計算、則尙未足額之二百餘萬公債、須要一年後方能達到原定額數、</p>
<p>中央派員　來港協慕</p>
<p>記者昨得消息、中央財政當局最近有派員來港協同勸募消息、特往訪分會主任委員周壽臣　紳、乘便叩詢今後勸募計劃、周主任答謂、中央派員來港督促勸募一事、彼木有得接消息、關于今後計劃、周主任表示意見、據稱、救　公債之認購係一種自當性質、過去公債推銷之得以迅速進展、係賴各界熱心僑胞之自動認購、現在各界團體或個人之長期購債、亦係本其個人熱誠自動實行、雖則分會過去曾有種種推計動劃、如沿門勸募等、都因環境關係不能實現、</p>
<p>周壽臣勉　僑胞努力</p>
<p>是以關于今後如何推進勸募使銷債咸績迅速進展、唯一方法、爲僑胞自動踴認購、按現員本港有不少工界商界團體及個人按月購債者、每月亦有十五萬元之譜、深盼全港僑胞、效法此種長期奮鬥之精神一致努力、尤其希望富有者念國家之寶貴、當前責止之重大、慷慨輸將、則一千萬之數、不難瞬息募集也云、記者復詢以全公債及國防公債之勸募進行、據答謂全公債由銀行直接發行、分會無需勸募、只曾接當局委任分會代售、至于國防公債、本會亦有推銷、但成績不及萬元、將來俟救國公債足額、然後劃大規模勸募云、</p>

<p>「公債公債，長期購買；一成收來，七七分派。四大巨頭，良心喪晒！偷龍轉鳳，省防公債……」</p>
<p>假使你到××××公司的工作間，休息站裏，只要那裏有上幾個工人，你便可以看到他們憤憤不平的交語着，他們每個人都會唱着上面這一首「數白欖」似的打油詩；那是有一天的早上，忽然在廠裏各個地方同時發現，用鉛筆草紙，用斜斜歪歪的字體寫成的，不到幾分鐘，這隻蠻有意思的歌謠，被用通俗的廣東話朗誦着，傳遍全廠，每個人都能够琅琅上口了。就是爲了這件事，公司方面開除了一個工人，據說是認出他的字跡，說他是寫這一首詩的。</p>

<p>『限於下星期一以前來領公債票和匯水尾子！』</p>
<p>冷酷的吿示貼出來了，被威嚇了的人們漸漸貼服了，他們逡逡巡巡，無可奈何的從財政部領囘了幾張破碎殘舊的債票，裏面還夾雜了一些省防公債票，沒有按着順序數碼的零亂的舊債票。此外，另發還一些匯水尾子，說是買剩了的。</p>
<p>「先生！你看！這樣還有天理嗎？」一個工友找着人冢，滔滔不絕地把他們的抑鬱傾訴出來了：「自從前年發動抗戰以後不久，公司就對我們說，以後工錢只發九五，其餘百分之五，公司要扣下來去買國防公債，我們當時一想，有錢出錢，有力出力是抗戰時期每個國民的責任，我們雖是終年辛苦難得一飽的勞工，可是旣然身在後方，便是節衣縮食，騰出一些錢來獻給國家，也是應該；旣然公司方面如此熱心，我們自然是一致贊成。道樣，公司就按月扣下了我們百分之五的工錢，扣到現在，巳經十七個月，總共扣下了一萬六千多塊港幣了。我們七百多工友，每月最少的也被扣七八毫錢。我們工人，總算是爲了國家，犧牲了自已不少的血汗了。</p>
<p>「可是，有一件事却是使我們不能不過問的，我們的工錢也扣了十七個月了，十七個月來，我們看不到一紙收條，看不到一個公佈的數目；究竟我們揖了多少錢，公司代我們買了多少錢，買些什麼樣的債票，我們是一點也不懂的，去向司理，司理只有把你申斥一頓，說這些事用不着你們管。」</p>
<p>「許多人都傳說着了：說公司不買國防公債，却買省防公歲，不說這些債票是從錢檯上買來的，這就是那首打油詩裏面所說的「偷龍轉鳳，省防公債」，「一成收來，七七分派」；那些債票沒是有跟連着的號碼的，是零亂的，是殘舊了的，同時，我們捐的是港幣，而貿的都是國幣，這个數目也是相差很大的。這些事實都不能不使我們懷疑，我們也會派代表到××分會去查問，可是分會那些先生們拒絕答覆。因此，我們不能不直接和公司交涉了，我們曾經由七個工作都份（交通部工程部……等）管工領導全體簽名，要求公司公佈數目，與求公佈債券號碼，可是公司不瞅睬我們的要求：他們只出了佈吿，說要把那餘下的錢——匯水尾子扣在公司財政部存下，作爲工人的保證金，公債也不繼續買了。</p>
<p>「這簡直是乘機剝削！不但欺騙我們工人，還欺騙着政府，這樣把我們的捐欵埋沒了，是誰也不心甘的，後來我們再派出代表找他們交涉，結果他們是答應公佈數目，答應發還尾子給工人自已去處置了，然而直到現在又過了廿天了，還不見數目公佈，却把在工人中比較有見識地有正氣的人開除了。現在還準備開除那些曾經和公司交涉過的代表，許多工人是被恐嚇壓迫得不敢出聲，靜悄悄的從財政部那邊領回了票子和尾子，連自己究竟出了多少錢，應拿囘多少錢也不敢問呢！</p>
<p>「現在公司方面又打算向工人用低價收囘了前次攤還了的債票了，聽說那是要拿到另一間廠裏，別有用處。」</p>
<p>『先生，人們常說香港人購債落後，不熱心，其實像我們這些窮人倒是熱心得很呢，像那有名的小販義賣運動，像我們這樣的經常「九五扣薪」的，差不多每間廠都是一樣的呢？誰說我們不熱心呢？？只是給那一些沒良心的人把我們這種熱心埋沒罷了！』</p>
<p>「可是，今天是給他騙過了，第二次我們是不會冉上當的，我們有七百多工友，我們有七百多个熱心愛國的人，我們是不會永遠被埋沒的，我想，社會人士也都同情我們的，要知道，我們現在並不是進行什麽勞資糾紛，而只是一件反對發國難財，反對欺騙政府，欺　民族國家的正義行爲呵……！」</p>
<p>這一位熱情的工友最後是這樣堅決的自信着。</p>
<p>相信像這樣的正發行爲將在一切正義感的人們裏展開起來吧，誰也不能袖手旁觀啊，這完全是爲了國家民族利益的事。</p>

<p>拿了五百元、我到了好萊塢、</p>
<p>母親開端、首先拿出二百五十元、姑母伊蘿西凑成四百、就連素來以小氣出名的却爾斯叔叔這次居然也大破慳囊、給了一百元出來、</p>
<p>我家裏的人都十分相信雜誌上常說的那句話、「一個女子若是想入電影界、至少手頭須備有五百元錢、否則可以不必來好萊塢」、我們想這一筆錢大約可以支持我在那兒四個月的用度、然而這是按照我們小鄉鎭上的生活程度而言，實際上、它只用了兩個半月、</p>
<p>我沒有亂花過一個不必要的錢、只有花一元五角上聖他安尼泰去看賽馬的一次、、另外用兩塊錢買一隻叫做亞當的馮、奇怪的是、它竟跑了個第一、贏了十一元八角錢、不過那天聖他安尼泰下雨、我不得不買頂新帽子（八元）、一些潤喉糖（二角五分）和傷風藥（五角）、又幾了一次髮（七角五分）、收支兩抵、實支一元二角正、</p>
<p>我家裏的人鄧把這五百元看做對於我身上的最後投資了，我在高等學校裏的成績，顯示出若是大學內沒有專攻戲劇部門的話、那末我還是留在家裏、放棄這個野心的好、同時我的像貌——我唯一有形的財產——有來很够得上往好萊場去的資格、而另一个無形的財產、便是我心中一个牢不可拔的信念、如果我不能上好萊塢去、則毋寧死去、記着、這个信念是最重要的、即使你有一萬塊錢、而缺乏這個信念、我　你不必上好萊塢來、那是不値得的、</p>
<p>就是這機、我一手握著這个信念、一手握着五百元的旅行支票，到這个明星發源地來、這五百元是我本篇中的「英雄人物」、我願意吿訴你們怎樣把它花去、</p>
<p>我一不是競賽的優勝者、二不是公司裏特別邀請來的外國人才、决不會有什麽影業中人來歡迎我、我跟著別人在洛杉磯下車、帶着我的大衣箱和兩個小皮箱跨下了那汚穢、陰　、吵閙不堪、糟透了頂的車站、呌了一輛出租汽車、駛過洛杉磯的商業區、終於在勞狄街的影人公寓前　了下來、家裏已經替我在那裏預定下房間了、（出租汽車費一元五角）、</p>
<p>這个公寓、在建築上說來、是个很考究的地中海式建築物、而在性質上、却是一个齊格飛歌舞班寄宿舍、我推門進去的時候、我確信我是在好萊塢了、裏面很多美麗的女子、回頭集中向我看了一眼、帶出一點鄙夷的神氣、彷彿是說「鄉下人」似的、又各自可頭去了、後來我才知道她們都是在等電話鈴響呢、</p>
<p>「……舒適優美的環境寬大的客室…裝有壁爐的圖書室與休息當…乒乓室和燃燭的餐廳…每個房間都有冷熱水管…免費供給洗衣室、小廚房、縫衣機、打字機、鋼琴、無綫電以及與攝影場互通消息的電詁…豐富的飯食…代爲設法求職…」</p>
<p>我的單人房間要十三元五角一星期、每天供給兩餐、而在這公寓內、和我抱着同樣目的而來的女子有九十八人、我本來很可以和別人合住一閒、只要八塊錢一星期，然而在那時候、我想我的五百元是永遠用之不竭的了、</p>
<p>第一、個星期除了有一點思鄉之念、以及小心留意外間的事而外、我沒有做什麽事、一星期過後、很聰明的、我發見了下列各事、</p>
<p>第一我的服裝、、在故鄉亨利斯維爾是很過得去的了、然而在這裏、却缺少了三樣極重要的東西、長褲子、人人都穿的墨西哥鞋、和一件厚的冬大衣、由加利福尼亞回鄉來的每個人都說那兒很暖和、沒有穿大衣的必要、可是晚上却出乎意料之外的冷得利害、無論如何漂亮的女子也敵不住冷得發抖的寒憎相不是、長褲子倒比較實用、那兒都可以穿、然而必須質料上等剪裁合式才行、一條長褲子花了我十五元九角五分，墨西哥式鞋子是四九角半、大衣、大緣凑巧、剛遇上大廉價、花了二十九元方角半、</p>
<p>第二、好來塢的女子看面貌比肚子重得多、寧可餓着肚子也不願疏忽面部化粧、而實實在在這也是她唯一可以吸引雇主的部份、每星期在美容手術上我得費兩元、最初、這筆支出使我很躊躇懊喪、終於我那點由故鄉帶來儉約的習性、在環境之下吿了屈服、</p>
<p>三、沒有汽車而想在好萊塢担任臨時演員的工作，簡直是不可能、距離往往是那麽遠、交通工具又不甚便利、除此而外、偶而在十五里外的地方得到一日的工作你坐兩次出租汽車來囘、所得的酬報還能有多少盈餘呢、在公寓裏備有汽車的女子、常常聰明的做點小生意、讓別人乘她的車子、獲得一點酬金、但是我却不願倚賴他人、我買了一輛汽車、在一九三三年它不折不扣足値九百大元、現在我用一百七十五元買來了、先付五十元、以後分期付款、每月二十、這是一輛靑綠色可卸去頂蓬的小車子、看來還算不　，公寓停車處每日收費一元、汽油機油之類每月約在十元左右、我開始活動起來、</p>
<p>活動的第一處便是好萊塢大道七〇四六號的演員同業公會、在那裏、一個面容和善的辦事員給了我一個猛烈的打擊、他說不是會員不能請求介紹拍戲、而要做會員呢、又非曾拍過戲或已有拍戲的指望才行、這個條例未免太苛而不合理、然而爲了臨時演員的生活計、對于像我這樣的人、或是那些自以爲是天才的人們、確是應該設止阻正侵入的、究竟合理與否姑且不論、反正我這條路是走不通的了、我要求得拍戲工作就要加入公會、而加入公會却又要曾拍過戲、沒辦法、</p>
<p>抱着較小的希望、走到這條大道另外一頭的中央演員介紹所去、這次的打擊更兇了、「無論任何情形下，絕對拒絕任何新人登記」、完了、很明顯的我連臨時演員也做不成、</p>
<p>囘到街上、我發現車胎破了一個、等候修理的時候（修理費不是五角而是一元、因爲被玻璃破片割破、情形比釘子戳破要嚴重得多、）、我想到現在還　幾條路徑開展至我　前、它們是、</p>
<p>一、囘家去</p>
<p>二、多到演員介紹所、代理處、以及影界中人常去的公共食堂去，參加新片獻映、在影片公司門口等候、希望能引起導演人的注意，</p>
<p>三、和一們代理人結朋友、使他介紹我進去、</p>
<p>四、做出點驚人的事、引起世界的注意、</p>
<p>我放棄了一四兩條、决定運二和三、因爲我住處和派拉蒙相距不遠、我常去徘徊等候、終於——眞好運氣——我遇見了一個代理人了、他很注意的問我話、對我很感興趣似的、稱讀我的美貌、很熱心的遞給我一張名片、約我第二天到他辦公室去、　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c54">又渡一難關　東方亞軍希望濃　全軍努力以四比三擊敗士葛 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>奠大局李四施威……撲空門鄧勤飲恨</p>
<p>甲組足球聯賽、這兩週閒、轉人密鑼緊鼓的階段了、東方會　着　　軍的爭奪、昨天下午又整師迎戰士葛于香港會場、雖然春雨連綿、天氣沉悶、但球迷們對這場比賽　章興、却不因此而减少、把昨天的看球人數　計起來、雖不　說是水洩不通、然而、亦相當的擠擁、東方健兒、終于不負望衆、在幾囘的肉搏衝鋒中、終干完成他們的　命、而把頑旅土葛擊潰、繼續向着亞軍的前途邁進、懷着了滿腔熱望的球迷、皆大歡喜、</p>
<p>東方此回得勝、論功行賞、李四應居第一、前衛三將</p>
<p>克盡　職、惟苗華國與徐步云、在雨中行軍、頗失常態二迭爲士　前鋒所劫持、負回三球純因內防不堅之咎，十葛人員作戰極英勇、前綫雖不見荷息其人、但三鋒互相合作、演出不錯、　　也可怕，惟所翼推進遲緩而已，</p>
<p>士葛　着了生替洋人球隊爭奪這　亞軍、昨天乃以頗完整　陣綫應戰、開賽未幾、卽猛向東方侵襲，哥羅福得布郎的傳中、沿邊來犯、偉權見狀、飛前擋駕、哥乃將球交給麥當奴、但卒爲仲堂一脚勾銷、在廿分鐘內、東方門前幾乎被敵、圍得桶　相似、負了的球數次、幸顯漢與數衛極力抵禦、得以不負、旣而東方反攻、澄滔帶球直上、從高吊下、於洽興一頂不中、竟成向前、又被鄧勤所阻、未幾、竟成再奪得來　、用力猛射、鄧勤臥　擋出、球兒尙離門不遠、德奇用脚反勾、爲衆衛所阻、木得其鬥而入、混戰多　、澄滔得機、一脚打破　勤的閉關政策、遂開紀錄、再戰有頃、德奇得炳土傳中、挑過菲沙、鄧勤見不佳、急欲衝出、德奇眼快、急從右角舉足、再送進一球、士葛一失再失，猛力反攻、中錄巴拿飛于亂軍中、得球挑過偉權的防綫、在離門廿碼處、射來很妙、還敬一口、士葛奪囘一城、士氣陡壯、東方門前多生驚險、說時遲、那時底、巴拿飛再得哥羅福傳中之便、又建一功、打成二比二的局面、而上半時不久就完了、</p>
<p>易陣冉　、士莫圍攻更急、東方數度突圍、依無效、卒被麥當奴單刀來　、射入一球、至是士葛反敗爲勝、國產球迷、皆爲急極、然而東方俱知自勉、眼見連失數球、深怕亞軍問題、勢成泡影、于是振臂一呼、全軍努力、前線五虎、一　進擊、果于最大努力之下、德奇伏在門前、乘偉權踢角球之便、頂上開花、球遂入網、旣成平局、軍心復振、人人奮勇、均抱必勝决心、雙方劇戰約廿分鐘、東方再迫角球、被菲沙擋出、球落偉權身前，乃再度傳中、德奇奮不顧身、洶湧衝前、再施故技、將頭一搖、將皮球送進綱內、造成四比三之局、獲得最後勝利而返、</p>

<p>劇戰分勝負</p>
<p>昨雙方勢均力敵、精彩百出、麗都許文奎表演最佳、允推第一功臣、李義臣亦殊賣力、曹張兩翼時有佳搆、尤以張銘生開送角球、準確無比、王克　爲遜色、中衝綫未見堅强、孫錦順坐鎭後方、屢救險球、功多過少、張林根尙差强人意、守鬥陸鍾　仍不免有大意之嫌、西捕守門威利表演遠在鍾恩之上、其所站地位特在、所失四球、實難挽囘、中後衛均失常態、球常踢向後方，且頻現漏洞、失敗徵結、卽在於此、前鋒綫尙稱活躍、中央鋒射門甚凶、右　胡特萊屢有妙鈞、左翼活更生則已感人老氣衰矣，騰都勝來、並不十分輕易也、</p>
<p>各一成平手</p>
<p>西捕先攻、惠斯胡特遙施脚頭、畏脚鹿接球傳前王克厚盤球進迪、傳與曹秋亭、曹向中鈎、透納拔脚挽　、球向後飛、威利躍起按付、未鑄大錯、麗都傾師猛撲敵營、西捕救成角球、由張銘生開來、角度殊佳、威利出不遠、曹秋亭趕上鈎射、直竄入網底、先開紀錄、時離開賽僅五分鐘、錦順犯規、特飛於二十碼處　踢兩次任意球、均吿斜逸、許文奎得張銘生傳　挑中、王克厚禾能　住、亦失良機、十分鐘時、特飛中路來犯、挑送胡特萊、胡鈎中、格林堡搭住發射、球由底角入門、長脚鹿不加挽救、遂成各一平手、</p>
<p>許王雙立功</p>
<p>西捕來勢再襲、胡特萊鈎送格林堡、格不待球停、發脚便射、高越橫木、麗都挺進、許文奎派司李義臣、季被阻、撥還文奎、文奎冉傳張　生、張鈎中、王克厚頭頂越界、球由西捕門區開出、特飛妙傳胡特萊、胡漏脚失機、許文奎得球盤前、大顯神通、高球挑中、透納慌張、踢成　球、張銘生開來、透納頭頂外、許加上一頂、爲威利接住、旋麗都又得角球機會、張銘生重　故智、　交奎於十六碼處猛施頭攻、立下功勳、不料僅隔二分鐘、張銘生鈞中、王克厚連人帶球衝入網內、麗都遂以三比一佔先、</p>
<p>西捕居下風</p>
<p>西捕反攻、培達力射、鍾恩擊出、曹王並進、傳予張銘生、張用左足射門、亦未建樹、西捕反攻、鐵腿救球不愼、踢入腹地、培達輕遞胡特萊、胡再傳格林堡、格射出太軟、鍾恩臥地撲住、離上半時休息僅五分鐘、活更生從左竄進、妙鈎門前、培特顯角有眼、西捕卒奪囘一球、繼培達得傑勃遜遙送、戴腿出阻落空、培於十碼處攻門、幸偏斜未中、李義臣高射敵門、威利撲空再撲、始吿脫險、迨上半時終了前一分鐘、曹秋亭主開角球、李義臣頂上開花、亦得一功、上半時麗都以四對二佔先、</p>
<p>麗都獲銀杯</p>
<p>易地再戰、未一分鐘、胡特萊以迅雷不及掩耳之手段、盤至底邊傳中、鍾恩一托、球撞橫木彈下、格林堡挺身迎去、碰進門內、西捐旣造成三對四、僅以一球落後之局面、進攻益急、麗都腹地敵騎縱橫、活更生得孫錦順踢來之球、衝前鈎中、鍾思身長、抱球出險、培特得胡特萊傳遞怒掃、幸中門柱、麗都見勢不佳、反守爲攻、文奎發射、威和臥地撲住滑去、迨義臣衝上、球已被威利將身壓住、傑勃　遠射、格林堡頭頂、均被鍾恩救出、卅六分鐘、王克　得李義臣派司、傳遞許文奎、許殺入禁區、無人來擋、怪脚起處、竟吿偏逸、西補雖極圖　扎、無奈心餘力細、時間吿終、麗都以四對三榮膺冠軍、</p>

<p>【本報專訊】上海麗都足球隊、乃本屆史高托杯（此杯制度一若本港之特別銀牌賽）的盟主、以一丙組之師、而有此種光榮收穫、眞是難能可貴、亦可以說、這是上海足球一個異蹟、</p>
<p>然而、麗都雖爲資格所制、暫時加入丙組聯賽、（上海西人足球聯會有一定例、凡新組的球隊、無論人材如何、不能開始即加入甲組賽，必須先行參加丙組或預備組聯賽、而經過有優好成績的、乃得陞級、本　麗都在丙組聯賽中旣有優良成績可見、復榮獲　高托杯、則來屆加入甲組聯賽、當不成問題）、但人材頂好、實力甚强、如孫錦順、陸鍾恩、曹秋亭、許文奎、譚福禎等、早已馳譽球搜、乃常今上流人物、老實說句、麗都的人材、比諸目下穩得甲組聯賽亞軍的東華隊、似未遠多讓、</p>

<p>— 杜埃</p>
<p>——預祝各縣市參政會的建立</p>
<p>民主政治所以爲現代人　熱烈擁護，這是　爲。代表着全體人民的意志，欲求和福和的一種組織。這所謂「代表」，如蘇聯的情形一樣，不祇是反映和傳遠的意思；更重要的，乃是根據听代表的人民底意思；更重要的，乃是根據代表的人民底意志，欲求和福利而將之賦予忠誠的執行，使人的崇高的意志和合理的要求，得成爲普遍存在於現實裏的眞實的事物。</p>
<p>無論是藝術和科學，天才或眞理，倘若這些東西要獲得其充分的發展，要盡其全力來開花，必須先要求得作爲這些發展和開花之保登的民族底生存與解放，而民族之獲得生存與解放，主要的條件又在於怎樣的增添和團結全民埃底蘊藏着的生動的力量，在於怎樣地在政治的組織上求得人民之熱忱的參加。這，　唯有用民主的制度，才能獲得完成，因此這是非常明白的，一切的藝術和科學，天才或眞理，理想與欲求，幸福與人性，要保證獲得無止境的合理的發展，眞正的民主政治是它們的唯一的保姆。</p>
<p>我們此次的抗戰，是全人民的共同的事業，民主政治之須要更大的推進，這正如抗戰之須要不斷的補充和增添新的力量，一樣明白的道理，因國民參政會的建立，就是爲的發揮全民的力量，去幫助政府取得那光輝的有着無限歡欣的永生的，最後勝和之到來。</p>
<p>過去三屆的國民參政會，曾經把廣大的人民之對於民主對於生存與解放的意見，一次多一次的發揮出來；曾一再努力地提供了許多直接致用於抗戰建國的力量，給我們全國的偉大鬥爭，使整個國家的人民開始呼吸着新鮮的朗氣，使整個政治推向於民主化，這是每一個人，都要加以贊許的。但是，由於國民參政會一時未能建立其各級的系統的組織，不然，她將必能發揮其更大的作用，現在各縣市的參政會，已在加緊着手建立，廣東各縣市的參收會，且有規定四月一日成立的消息，我們希望，今後的全國參政會有了系統的組織；有了中下層的基礎，當能更充分的反映人民意見，更進一步的發揮人民抗戰力量</p>
<p>第二屆國民參政會經通過了『加强民權主義的實施」一案，際此各縣市參政會行將成立的時候，我們覺得上述决議首先須在實行民權主義的參政會里切實加强實施起來。關於各縣市的參政員人選方面，應該包括各種職業的代表，充分的按照統一戰綫的原則，盡量的吸收各縣市的各黨各派份子，各界領袖，及無黨無派的人民團體的擾秀代表，最低限度亦須依照國民政府的組織成分。這樣才能建立廣大的國民基礎，完善地表達人民的意見。使整個國民參政會的幾　健全强固起來，去積極推動抗戰建國綱領的實施。</p>
<p>作爲人民的耳，眼，口，鼻和心的，不祗是作家。一切的文化工作者，藝術家和戰士，都包括在內。然而，也正因爲是這樣一件直接關係人民福利，抗戰建國事業的新政治的建設，屬於「文化的」這種意味上的工作者，是應該較其他的人，更狂熱和關心的吧！所以目前文化界工作者，對於怎樣地去推動新政治之建立，使其合乎理想的發展起來，是當前一般的工作中所不應忽視，而應看作是重要工作之一，熱烈地經常執行起來。（三月廿二日）</p>
<h3 id="c69">略論文藝通信 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>關於文藝通信，在各報上曾有過多次討論。這種意見的提出，是井常可取的，因爲文藝通信不獨適於目前的抗戰情勢，且就是在將來和平時也自有其地位。文藝通信可說是報吿文學的一支分流。　報吿文學因爲發自作者的一面，所以多少不免有幾分主觀——至少在一般讀者的心目中是如此。文　通信可說是兩面　的報吿文學，幾方的筆——管個人間的是否相識——　將各自所在地所發生的情形，作有機聯繫的報吿給對方的讀者，那怕筆者各自寫的主觀的所見，甚至涉及些私人的瑣事，但只要這種瑣事　不全然離開大的現實，則在讀者反能從兩邊通信者所　述的大小事件中，歸納出　個事件的客觀眞相。</p>
<p>國內文藝通信的當作問題提出，雖然　最近的事，但文藝通信在國際間，白柴　霍甫的世界語誕生後就早實行了，無論在私人間和團體間，以世界語推行國際文藝通信最熱心的國家，應推蘇嗨，過去上海曾有過一張La　Mo　ds　世界語報紙，就曾介紹過國　文藝通信一類的東西，蘇聯的多數世界語靑年團體，常和各國有相同的團體舉行　信，而將良好的東西發表在壁報上或其他刊物上，就是學習世界語的個人與個人間，也普遍地舉行通信，雖然這種通信不一定是嚴格的文藝的，但學術的討論，彼此地方情形的報吿，以爲個人思想的交換，仍不失爲廣泛的文藝通信，現在筆者個人雖不知此方面發展情形，但深覺這種方式是很可取的，若以一國的語言推進國內文藝通信運動，其結果一定要比以世界語的國際通信易於普遍發展。</p>
<p>我人認爲文藝通信運動的展開，最初雖得有報紙雜誌等的較勵提　，多多發表達一類的優秀東西，但就從事於文藝通信的本人言，他們主要目標，還是在交換知識思想，而不是在將他們的通信發表。由志趣的交接而謀個人的結合，客觀上就等於民衆的自動組織起來，　在目前抗戰中的中國，無疑是壹個很人的帮助。</p>
<p>關於文藝通信的形式，若果以發表爲目的，那麼當然還不出報吿文學相似的方式。但若採取個人或團體式的通信，內容上再滲入壹些瑣細的（但不壹定純粹　人的）叙述，那麼這一定要比報吿文學更能使對方　讀者感到一層親切，而對第三者的讀者，也倍感興味。</p>

<h3 id="c70">文章清潔運動 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 波</p>
<p>文章像一面大鏡子，難能反映種梅社會相和一切現實的生活，但他所反映出的正確程度，却須視　面的光凈與否爲轉移，如果內外在的缺憾與塵埃蒙蔽了它，便難再克盡其反映現實和指示木來的最大實任，而在此時來推行一個文字淸潔運動，也就不算是多餘的事了。</p>
<p>目前的本港各色文章，正如壹面不甚潔凈的鐘子壹般，假如你先就普通從事文字上工作者細加觀察，那末，就很可看出下面的三點：其一是　于公式主義的人們太多了，他們寫作的東西眞像「養孩子」似他，有了甲因，你必定可猜出下面的乙果，無論是理論或文藝都免不了這種傾向，文中的英雄必是頂天立地的好漢，俘虜定必是屈膝伏地的猥瑣人物，模仿重于創造，典型與個性的描寫也都很少成功，結果就完全變作理想的境地，晚離現實生活，終於給人稱爲「抗戰八股了」：其次二種人寫作的立場是站得不錯的，可惜經騐還嫌不够，醫如他的意思本是想寫我軍奮勇作戰，祗因誇張過份了，便寫成如×人一般橫暴，又如他或分析戰時後方民衆動態作一番介紹，也爲了宣染失調滲入一些消極的成份進去，于是無意中就替人家作了養務的反宣傳了，又其次的一類人似乎生就是工愁碧病者。在抗戰中依然醫治不了它，時時拈些傷感灰色的題目，寫些什麼『思，憶，寄，懷，悼，夢，」一型的文章，惹得別人都要替他傷心了，這種文章雖說足以表示我們的不忘故物，但實際除了「表示」之外又有什麼積極的意思？無利於人，徒然糟揭自己的感情罷了，上面的三種文章底毛病是在干　于公式，　曲主題，和脫離現實，要幹文潔工作先應從這些病症上治療各人的文章，各人自己明白，所以這一方面的文章淸潔運動便可由寫作者自動去實行，把創造能力充實了，主題認淸了，時代的意義也能有充分的了解。便已使文章總到淸潔的地步，沒有二星兒瑕疵也沒有一些兒毒素！</p>
<p>關於淸潔旁人的文章方面，我也可以提出原則分作兩點講，一點是淸潔主和論者的文章，以斷絕奸人誘惑人心的工具，他們在機關刊物及小册子中，不斷地鼓吹着亡國辱　的主和論，陽托抗戰，陰　狡計，而所寫的文章居然也旁敲側擊，似乎寫得頭頭是　，如使認識不淸者觀之，很有上營的可能，所以發動集團力量嚴厲指斥此種荒　宣傳，淸潔汚耳文章，實是我們最低限度的工作，還有一點是我很不願提而又不能不提的一大批誨淫小報，這些淺薄的「商人了」爲了看重自己的利益而出版的小報，常躉售荒唐的「艷情小說」雖然是一張小小的三日刊，但其銷路却往往比大報還多，單　幾十種小報能同時維持下去，就可知香港中『淫報』奉的人是如何的衆多，並且那些小說還會因『觀衆多』而出版單行本，或是二集三集的這樣續下去，此如悄形你能忽視他「佈毒」的潜勢力嗎？也許不像主和言論的顯明可見，但人總是不見好德如好色」的，這樣的文字足以消磨壯志委實可怕，因此以輿論指摘的力量，來淸潔這種「香艷綺麗」的文章　與前者同其需要，假如能更進一步作有力制裁上項「主和」與「誨淫」的毒文，那自然更是我們所期望的。</p>

<p>「喂！救護隊……兄弟！救……救我們呀！……」</p>
<p>還離前綫四里路遠的一段公路上，被好些傷乒把我們的卡軍攔住了，這里滿地都是躺着的，伏着的傷兵，他們有的傷得很靈，除開呼吸還斷斷續續的跳動外，別的都已化了的。那空氣積滯着恐怖又空虛的情調，籠罩住整个血紅的綠原。我還緊緊記得：有個客籍的砲兵，他被炸去了一段手幹，舉着那剩下來的被鮮血和塵沙染得土紅色的一隻淋漓的禿臂，　伏在田邊，還不時有意無意他拾起那隻炸斷了的慘白的血手，凝望又凝望着，沒有悲哀，沒有痛楚，也沒有微笑和一切的表情的地凝望着。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hitler's Second Plan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The other day, newspapers published the content of Hitler's second plan, as revealed by the London "News Chronicle." Three points are worth noting: (1) The targets of Hitler's future demands will no longer be limited to Eastern Europe; the scope has expanded to the entire Europe, even involving Africa. (2) Germany's targets of aggression can no longer be confined to small European countries; it has clearly shown its intention to invade the territories of Britain and France. (3) Hitler will not only plan for himself in the future but also plan for his accomplice, Italy. As Europe is in a state of "the storm is about to break," we should have a profound understanding of this second plan. Here are some of my views:</p>
<p>(1) This second plan further reveals that Hitler's aggression is endless. Last September, the British and French authorities assessed Hitler's actions as the division of a part of Czech territory, the self-determination of the Germanic people. However, in a short time, Germany annexed the entire Czech Republic. Now, German guns are aimed at Romania, and a large-scale troop movement has begun towards Insterburg and Tilsit, two towns on the border between Prussia and Lithuania. According to general European speculation, the crisis of Germany annexing Lithuania is imminent, and Poland is already on tenterhooks. Hitler also plans to incite national socialist parties in various countries to rise up in response and to incite revolution in France. The reactionary nature of "Nazism" is international, and this can be fully recognized here. If Hitler's aggression is completely successful in Eastern Europe, it is believed that he will turn around and attack Britain and France, disrupt the entire Europe, and even the whole world, before long. "Heroic nations" naturally have their destinations.</p>
<p>(2) Hitler also wants to instigate his accomplice, Italy, to make demands on Britain and France, thereby restraining them and facilitating his aggression. Hitler does not fundamentally care for Italy, but because his own foundation is not yet solid, he still needs like-minded countries to be his helpers. Therefore, in the second plan, he is doing his best to bargain with Britain and France for Mussolini. Hitler's approach can both please Mussolini and demonstrate strength to Britain and France, demanding that they let go and not interfere with his tyranny in Eastern Europe. A London dispatch also reported that Mussolini would deliver a sensational speech next Sunday, and it is generally expected that this speech may become the fuse for the next incident. At the same time, it was also reported that Hitler would make a gesture to support Italy's demands before Mussolini's speech. The inside story of the two aggressors colluding with each other is already clear.</p>
<p>(3) Hitler is probably going to support the aggressors in the East, which can both restrain Britain and France and threaten the United States and the Soviet Union. The recent dangerous actions of Germany, Italy, and Japan are all based on collusion. Not long after the joint military and diplomatic meeting of the three countries in Berlin, Italy immediately vigorously helped Franco's troops advance to the French border, and the aggressors in the East also occupied Hainan Island at the same time. At that time, newspapers reported that Hitler demanded that Japan threaten Britain and France in the Pacific. All conspiracies have been exposed by facts. Now that Hitler is engaged in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union's support for various small countries is quite active, and it is believed that Hitler will also instigate Japan to actively advance into northern Manchuria and the northern seas to restrain the Soviet Union – although Japan's restraint will not be effective. Perhaps Japan, which has been cleverly used by Hitler several times, may recently take advantage of the troubled times in Western Europe to actively seek a rapid end to the Sino-Japanese War through military action. In that case, the military unrest of the Japanese army in central and southern China may be even more likely.</p>
<p>(4) Finally, what we should recognize even more deeply is that although Hitler has launched a "Nazi crusade to the East," Germany's strength does not yet allow him to seriously erupt into a second world war. Germany's preparation and strength are not as great as they were before the European War. Although Britain and France are weak, when the aggressor's pressure exceeds a certain limit, it can force Britain and France to unite with the Soviet Union and other small countries to offer strong resistance to Hitler. What Hitler can use today are gestures, not real fighting. Therefore, the implementation of Hitler's second plan may still take some time. Recently, because of Hitler's violence, democratic countries around the world have shown a tendency to unite more closely. Britain has proposed a joint anti-German proposal to the Soviet Union. Although a British-Soviet alliance may not be realized immediately, and a six-nation European conference may not be convened successfully, it is not impossible for Britain and the Soviet Union to abandon their mutual suspicion of the past 20 years and consider the extent of Hitler's advances in order to jointly deal with Germany. There is also a full possibility that a six-power declaration will be issued. The dangerous behavior of Germany and Italy is all about exploiting the contradictions between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and underestimating the cowardice of Britain and France. If Britain and France can abandon their suspicion of the Soviet Union and take further steps to unite, and at the same time give Hitler a powerful gesture, the further dangerous actions of Germany and Italy may be temporarily stopped.</p>
<p>The key to future developments lies entirely in whether Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and small European countries can unite. The main driving force lies in Britain and France. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a six-nation European conference and jointly organize an "anti-Hitler group" is, according to all parties' speculation, certainly out of sincerity. However, news from London said: "Whether Britain will take the lead in completing the encirclement of Germany depends on the attitude of the small countries." This is a pessimistic phenomenon.</p>
<p>Now is the best opportunity for Britain to win leadership. Although Japan is deploying troops in the northern seas and northern Manchuria, it does not seem to be the time to fight the Soviet Union. Yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita also revealed the news that the fishing agreement could be resolved satisfactorily. The United States has a deep awareness of the internationalization of National Socialist activities and their penetration into the Americas, and has taken deep precautions. If Britain can express sincerity to the United States and the Soviet Union, it can stop Hitler's arrogance without moving a single soldier. Whether Britain can grasp the leadership of Europe depends on whether it can maintain justice in Eastern Europe and the Balkans!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Seven Deadly Vices <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Soong Mei-ling</p>
<p>If our country can truly concentrate on internal clearing and reorganization, making it as orderly as a house, then it won't take long for the original face of our nation to be reflected on those shiny fixtures. Because I am eager to see this bright scene, I am driven by this patriotic desire to contribute my share of strength in this overall clearing service, and I am willing to expose the dark corners in the sunlight without hesitation. Of course, many people would rather be simple and avoid medical treatment, but for the glory of the country, for the country to progress in an orderly manner, we must not have any scruples and must assume our due obligations.</p>
<p>What we need is national organization. In fact, this is not difficult. As long as we remove those bad habits that obscure our eyes and hinder our political and social progress, organization will immediately be realized.</p>
<p>First of all, what needs to be mentioned is "factionalism." This seems to dominate our activities everywhere. This concept is so deeply rooted that any undertaking, large or small, is hindered by it and cannot develop. Those who have factional ideas do not take the success or failure of the undertaking as a prerequisite, but take the differences and similarities between factions as a prerequisite. If a person belongs to a faction other than their own, no matter how capable that person is, everyone will try their best to prevent him from obtaining a position in their group, thus producing the bad phenomenon of using private interests to harm public interests. Any talented person with free and independent thoughts and personality will never demean himself to cling to and seek acceptance. Therefore, those who value factions will definitely squeeze out or indirectly try to prevent those who are not members of their faction but are working around them from being at peace in their positions. Therefore, every faction is a gathering place for those who fill positions without qualification. It cultivates corruption and regression, fosters suspicion and double-dealing, and produces cowardice and selfishness. As a result, it not only causes the country to degenerate step by step but also increases the country's useless burden. In short, in factionalism, there is no unity and mutual assistance, only the intuition and actions of a mob.</p>
<p>Secondly, the lack of self-control is also similarly harmful. The fundamental reason for the formation of this bad habit is the lack of spiritual education in schools, or the lack of good role models by officials. Whatever the reason, this is a symptom of lameness. If students are not guided by great spirits when they are in school, how will they know how to overcome bad environments without being influenced by them after they grow up? People who do not know or have the ability to control their own actions must be irrelevant to the interests of the country, or even unaware of the responsibilities of the people, and will not hesitate to take wrong actions that harm the country. As for officials who bear political responsibility, if they lack the ability to control themselves, they can gradually affect their subordinates. Even a gatekeeper will follow suit, living a drunken and dreamy life. It corrodes the fabric of the entire country like oxygen.</p>
<p>Evading responsibility – this is also a common and shameful disease. Among civil servants, its harm is equivalent to a crime. This is what is commonly known as "passing the buck," which was a common practice in officialdom in the past. Officials are very familiar with using an almost instinctive and extremely skillful means to shirk practical responsibilities. Everything can be "none of my business." This is a Chinese characteristic that foreigners cannot understand. Part of the reason is also due to the concept of "face." It seems that pushing away is damaging the other party's "face," and being criticized for not doing well is also losing one's own "face." But the important key lies in ignorance, lack of governing ability, lack of personality, or simply not hesitating to openly obstruct the progress of the undertaking. The impact of this habit is very far-reaching. The promotion and progress of various undertakings, especially in the economic field, have been stagnant and backward because of it.</p>
<p>The extent to which the development of various natural resources has been hindered by evading responsibility is simply incalculable. With this bad habit, many plans for industrial and transportation have been shelved, and many suggestions regarding culture and others that were originally sufficient to improve the people's spiritual and material lives have not been implemented. If something was originally complicated, it becomes even more chaotic due to repeated evasions. Since things cannot progress, responsibility becomes even more unclear. In fact, those who evade responsibility are the ones who should bear the guilt for China's decline. When our descendants write the history of this period, they will clearly distinguish them. But this deserved fair judgment and punishment are only for the future, not for the present. These people who evade practical responsibility are stacked in official positions like wood, as mentioned earlier. Almost every personnel record in every government agency is crowded with these unproductive deadwoods. The origin, of course, is due to the actions of a few people, but when superiors follow suit, those who occasionally refuse to be responsible for national affairs will create many shameless masses. We can only call this group a "army of rice buckets." The officials and soldiers in this army are too incompetent – their senior officials have neither backbone nor conscience to remove them, and although they occupy their positions without doing anything, they accept undeserved rewards without feeling anything, smugly thinking that they have succeeded. Countless people's blood and sweat could have been used properly to hire talented and capable people to promote the progress of the country's undertakings in many aspects, but they are consumed so unjustly and wrongly. How painful!</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is also the vice of self-abandonment, which is often expressed in the gloomy phrase "there's no way." What does this sentence mean? It is always an excuse for irresponsibility, indifference, laziness, incompetence, and a base attempt to avoid difficulties and responsibilities when doing something novel or important. It is also the word that Napoleon said was not in his dictionary. It is also the magic weapon used by the Qing Dynasty officials to eliminate progressive and promising people, because they knew that if they accepted those capable people, their own positions would be shaken. Its effect is equal to "impossible," "can't do it." In the past, this idiom could often be heard in various guardhouses. Today, in this extraordinary period, it is still a shame to hear the echo of this sound wave. The current period is precisely the period when we hope to use it as a complete reform of all unforgivable evil habits in the near future, and to protect ourselves from various deadly poisonous arrows. How can there be "no way" in the world? In this extraordinary period, "there is no way" must also "find a way." Those who use "there is no way" as a mantra are representatives of those who are not attentive and unwilling to work, and they are always the most terrible and harmful elements in the country.</p>
<p>Again, we also have a bad habit, that is, the so-called "almost," which is a common saying on the lips of those who are sloppy, casual, and lazy. Its meaning is the lack of accuracy. It is equal to "let it go" or "the difference is limited." It is the most common term in the language of those who are vague and ambiguous. In the most precise machine manufacturing plant, it is a great danger; it declares the death penalty for the element of "accurate and reliable" that is essential for any recent undertaking or success. Among the many disasters it has caused, we can see the failure of the silk and tea business, because "almost" results in unreliable samples, and the manufacturing and shipping are not meticulous. Don't you hear those who make silk say: "There are some bad cocoons here;" The person in charge, in order to save trouble, goes on to say, "Almost, let it go;" But in a very far away country, someone is saying: "This kind of silk is of uneven quality and useless, we will not buy it next time." This is the benefit that "almost" gives us. Not only is this the case with silk and tea products, but many other aspects of the business have also suffered the same damage.</p>
<p>The seven deadly vices have been explained in order above. In addition to this, there are several other disadvantages that we cannot ignore. For example, jealousy and narrow-mindedness are all bad. Although these disadvantages can be found everywhere in the world, they are harming the country in the long term in China because of the lack of efficiency in everything. Sometimes we are very clever in small things, but very muddled in big things; When we choose and purchase the things that the country needs, we also often have psychological and moral prejudices and evils: and we often forget or are unwilling to comply with the regulations. Some people are in a position to issue orders, but they do not think about whether they have complied with those laws, and at the same time, they do not seriously defend those who have violated these laws, which is considered the worst thing. An illegal matter is usually taken very seriously in other places, but in China, it does not seem to be necessary to take it seriously.</p>
<p>We usually have two important shortcomings when dealing with foreigners. The first is that we often send a layman to negotiate technical contracts, and the second is to use people with insufficient knowledge and poor language skills as translators. Because the meaning of words is not clear and the language cannot be fully integrated, the misunderstandings that occur are imaginable. They have made some stupid and serious mistakes, and no one would believe it if you said it, but I know that there are such things. Even those who are considered competent translators inevitably make unbelievable mistakes. I have really heard a lot of such stories. If it were not for the seriousness of these mistakes, they would be laughable.</p>
<p>In the past, our economic plans with foreigners often failed to produce results, and everyone felt uncomfortable; the reason can be said to have largely occurred because the assigned translators were not capable enough. How to avoid this completely unnecessary separation and easily cause difficult reasons when we hold important negotiations with foreigners in the future is a matter worth serious consideration.</p>
<p>When we discuss or negotiate financial, economic or industrial plans with foreigners, only those who are fully familiar with the technical terms can be used as translators. The losses we have suffered in the past due to translation errors are truly incalculable. China can benefit from the successful negotiation of several plans or issues. We don't have to worry about what has happened in the past, but there is no reason to say that we should continue to suffer this kind of unpleasant loss caused by misunderstanding in the future. All those responsible for negotiations should have high levels of required conditions, the richest knowledge, the noblest character, the fullest understanding, and the most sound imagination. Before proceeding with the negotiations, they should consider how to successfully reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, and even if the negotiations fail, they must be able to give legitimate and sufficient reasons. Those who are incompetent should be punished to show the reasonable punishment that should be given for the failure of the negotiations. In the past, agreements often failed because negotiators failed to profit from them. This is also a bad phenomenon that we should reform and prevent from recurring in the future.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned vices and bad habits that I have listed are removed or corrected, then the National Spiritual Mobilization Plan resolved by the recent National Political Council can be immediately implemented from theory to practice. At the same time, all crimes of evading practical responsibility, using public office for private gain, and dereliction of duty should be listed as "treasonous" acts, so that everyone will know that they should be abandoned by the people.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned shortcomings combined have prevented our country from making progress for many years. Now we have seen the solution, and I believe that as long as we can show firm perseverance, we can completely eliminate these stains. In fact, these stains must be washed away as soon as possible. We already know the solution; these vices are of course not difficult to cure. Now is really the only time for us to get rid of the old and bring in the new and to teach the dead to survive. Patriotism and national self-esteem make all the people of the country, even the very cowardly and careless elements among them, cannot but wake up, stand up bravely and actively, and respond to this distant and powerful giant sound that is always lingering in our hearts with our self-reliant and self-improving heroic posture and actions, this sound that moves and has power, a word: Resurga – I will be reborn! I pray that all 450 million compatriots of our nation will make a firm cry of "I will be reborn," and use the sound to evolve into power, and use this sound to initiate action, to achieve our "revival of the Chinese nation"!</p>
<h3 id="e3">Shanghai Youth in Bitter Struggle: Second Phase of the War of Resistance Propaganda Week - Youth Day, Youth of All Circles Issue Joint Declaration <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondence) The 7th of this month was the sixth day of the War of Resistance Propaganda Week held under the leadership of the Shanghai Special City Party Department. The youth of all circles in this city have issued a special joint declaration, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Spirit of Sacrifice</p>
<p>Beloved youth of the whole city, youth has always occupied a supremely glorious page in the revolutionary history of our country. As evidenced by the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution and the overthrow of the warlords in the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, the vast majority of those who participated were mainly youth. This glorious feat of sacrifice can truly be immortalized alongside our Chinese nation. Further evidence can be found in the bloody battle of Songhu in April of the previous year, where they directly participated in the frontline battles, splattering hot blood on the enemy, and exacting a considerable price, creating a moving and tearful historical record, as well as doing various political, educational, social, and medical work, indirectly devoting themselves to the war. The majority of these efforts are still attributable to the youth of all circles.</p>
<p>Anti-War Sentiment</p>
<p>Now that we are in Shanghai, which has already been reduced to an isolated island, our anti-war sentiment continues to rise with the years of the city's occupation. Therefore, many in our youth ranks have already gone to the inland to serve in the military, join guerrilla units, and participate in other work that is beneficial to the war of resistance. Even those who remain on this isolated island are united in their hatred of the enemy and are constantly making various preparations for the war of resistance and nation-building. Patriotic actions are still being carried out continuously.</p>
<p>Future Goals</p>
<p>Although our past efforts have already achieved considerable results, at this time when the country is encountering unprecedented national difficulties and the war of resistance enters its second phase, thinking of the great expectations that the country has for youth, and the significant responsibilities that youth should bear for the country, we feel that our past contributions are still somewhat unworthy of the country. It must be known that in extraordinary times, every one of us youth should have extraordinary actions! Therefore, we list three things as the goals of our joint efforts in the future.</p>
<p>First, support Chairman Chiang's Letter to the Youth of the Nation—We must respectfully follow the points proclaimed in Chairman Chiang's Letter to the Youth of the Nation: (1) Participate in wartime mobilization—Each should contribute their efforts according to their knowledge and abilities, regarding fighting as their sacred duty and sacrifice as a matter of course. (2) Receive various trainings—When necessary, we must go to the inland to receive military training in order to acquire the skills to defend our nation and the way to be loyal to the party and love the country, and to receive political training in order to acquire the political literacy necessary to build a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. (3) Promote cultural construction—Intellectual youth must automatically participate in the movement to eliminate illiteracy, jointly carry out correspondence education, and strive to participate in war of resistance propaganda, so that the general public has a correct political consciousness and a considerable level of culture. (4) Promote labor service—Comprehending Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching that "life is for service," participate in social production and other activities to develop the national economy, while at the same time deeply entering the people and getting close to the masses, and gaining the faith of the general compatriots through work achievements. (5) Cultivate production skills—Pay attention to the cultivation of science, so that consciousness, words, and actions are all scientific, cultivate a new national character that is organized, precise, and practical, and at the same time receive technical training, and cultivate the skills of livelihood and labor, so that the majority of young people can serve in agriculture, commerce, roads, mines, electricity industry, and the great construction of the country can be completed faster.</p>
<p>Second, vigorously implement spiritual mobilization—We must respectfully follow the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline formulated by Chairman Chiang and its implementation measures: (1) Recognize the common goal—Concentrate will and strength, and strive for the supremacy of the nation, the supremacy of the race, the primacy of military affairs, and the primacy of victory. (2) Practice ethics—Be extremely loyal to the country, practice great righteousness to the nation, and evolve into the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, faith, harmony, and peace. (3) Establish faith in nation-building—Establish the Three Principles of the People, created by Sun Yat-sen, as the highest principle for China's nation-building, so that the country we want to build in our ideal is independent, free, and equal externally, and owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people internally. (4) Transform the spirit—Correct the life of drunken dreaming and death, cultivate an enterprising and vigorous spirit, eradicate the habit of complacency and laziness, break the attempt of selfishness and self-interest, and correct the divergent and complex thinking. (5) Mobilize leadership—In accordance with the mobilization implementation measures, practice it personally, directly and indirectly promote it continuously, so that satisfactory results can be obtained in the shortest time.</p>
<p>Third, earnestly implement the New Life Movement—We must respectfully follow the New Life Movement Outline promoted by Chairman Chiang, earnestly implement propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and achieve the eight characters of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and plainness. Therefore, we must (1) militarize life—Thoroughly eliminate the past habits of weakness, looseness, retreat, decadence, and abandonment, in order to cultivate good habits such as clarifying shame and valuing martial spirit, enduring hardship and hard work, loving the country, valuing credit, and valuing simplicity, plainness, keeping discipline, and keeping time. (2) Articize and hygienicize life—In work, strive for strictness and humility, in treating people, strive for sincerity, attack, kindness, and generosity, in handling affairs, strive for speed and precision, in receiving objects, strive for frugality and cleanliness. (3) Proletarianize life—In terms of wealth, advocate thrift and savings, and strive to increase social resources; in terms of labor, pay attention to time and operation, and strive for quantitative increase and qualitative enrichment; in terms of materials, pay attention to the advocacy of domestic goods, and strive for the austerity and love of goods.</p>

<p>[Reuters Chongqing, 23rd] Japanese troops in Jiangxi Province are currently attempting to occupy Nanchang, advancing towards Nanchang in six routes. The main force is in Yongxiu, and the scope of the battle is extremely wide, from Duchang on the east bank of Poyang Lake to Wucheng on the west bank, and extending westward to Xi and Wuning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanchang, 23rd] On the 21st, enemy planes bombed the south bank of the Henan River several times. Our anti-aircraft units responded with fierce fire.

<p>[Central News Agency Nanchang, 22nd] The battle situation in Wucheng is very intense. Since the morning of the 18th, two small enemy warships and thirty or forty speedboats have sailed from the Xingzi area and bombarded our Wucheng for more than 500 rounds. All the houses in our city have been destroyed. At noon, more than 200 enemy soldiers attempted to land on Yejiashou, and fierce artillery battles broke out on both sides. One small enemy warship and three or four speedboats were sunk by our forces. The enemy's flames were slightly reduced.

After half a day of fierce fighting, a part of Hexilong was occupied by the enemy. On the afternoon of the same day, our army counterattacked and recovered Hexi. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy changed its landing site again to the area around Longtoushan and Songmenshan (about 20 li northeast of Wucheng). This area is protruding from the lake surface. Our defending troops fought hard and moved to a new position at noon. The enemy continued to invade Gaoshan, and the fierce battle continued. At 3 p.m., we abandoned Gaoshan. On the morning of the 20th, under the cover of enemy planes, artillery fire, and poison gas, the enemy again attacked Hexilong. Due to strategic considerations, we defended the high ground south of Hexilong and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. On the same day, 200 to 300 enemy soldiers also landed at Wanjun Temple west of Wucheng, and have been annihilated by our army.</p>
<p>[Central Fanshi 22] In central Hubei, the enemy has withdrawn its attacking troops for reorganization. Currently, those remaining along the Xiang River are either old and weak remnants of the enemy or hastily assembled bandits and puppets. Judging from the current enemy military strength, the enemy does not seem to have major plans, but the enemy along the Xiang River still harbors the ambition to cross the river.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Fanshi, 22nd] Wangjiang in western Anhui was recovered by our forces the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu, 21st] A large-scale guerrilla war has now broken out in northern Jiangsu. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy sent three armored vehicles to cover infantry and attacked from Huaian. When they arrived near ××, they were fiercely counterattacked by our defending troops, who drove the enemy back to the north of ××.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu, 21st] The enemy entrenched in Huai'an is afraid of our counterattack and is now defending very strictly. They are also allowing civilians to return to the city, ostensibly showing leniency. However, when the enemy occupied the city, they carried out large-scale looting, and the people, stimulated by this, have risen up to participate in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>[Central, A Certain Place in Northern Shandong, 22nd] (1) The enemy recently launched a large-scale attack on Hebei. After our army repeatedly intercepted them along various routes between Qinghe and Weixian, on the morning of the 20th, a certain Wang Regiment of our division engaged in a fierce battle with more than 7,000 enemy soldiers in Jiangjiazhuang, east of Weixian, until evening, encircling and annihilating the enemy.

They engaged in a fierce battle in the area of Shoutun Nujiazhuang. The enemy charged several times and suffered countless casualties.</p>
<p>[Central Xingji, 23rd] The enemy has begun to conscript villagers aged 18 to 20, and the nearby residents have fled. The enemy in Yu County recently claimed that they would block all the passes of the Zhongtiao Mountains and threatened to cut off traffic between Banlu and Jincheng within five weeks. The Tongpu Railway is now laid to the Xiecun roadbed in the western suburbs of Jieding, and construction is underway to Xihucun. It is rumored that it will be extended to Yuxiang. The needed wooden sleepers are being forced by the puppet security team to be cut down, and 4,000 sleepers are being forcibly demanded from the villages west of Jie.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xing, 23rd] At the beginning of this month, the enemy gathered more than 7,000 troops in Taiyuan, Xin County, Qingyuan, and other places, and attacked the area below Taiyuan in several routes.

The enemy occupying Wufeng Mountain from Gujiao is currently being surrounded and annihilated by our forces.</p>
<p>[Central Changde, 23rd] Military agencies received a telegram from Nanchang stating that large squadrons of enemy planes were taking turns bombing the Xiushui area all day long to cover enemy troops in battle. The battle on the Nanxun Line is very fierce, with our troops confronting each other at Sangongdu in Xiushui. Our side still occupies the advantage.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Wengyuan, 23rd] On the 19th night, a guerrilla unit of our army suddenly attacked Daliang, and a fierce street battle broke out with the enemy and the puppet army of the traitor Li Daoxuan in the city.

<h3 id="e5">Yan Xishan Talks About the Shanxi Situation: Our Fifty Divisions of Troops Are Active in Shanxi, Anihilating More Than 10,000 Enemy Soldiers in Two Weeks, A Million-Strong Reserve Army is Being Actively Organized <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Communication from a Certain Place in Shaanxi] After a week-long journey through Shanxi on horseback and in automobiles, a Reuters reporter arrived at the top-secret headquarters of General Yan Xishan, Commander-in-Chief of the Second War Zone of China, which includes the entire province of Shanxi and parts of the three provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The headquarters is located in a cave city in the mountain range bordering Shaanxi, as the geological structure of the two provinces of Shaanxi and Huang is most suitable for excavating caves, and the Chinese army has fully utilized this point to resist air raids. All the rock walls have been excavated into living rooms, offices, and ancillary facilities. On the evening the reporter arrived, he was invited to stay in a bedroom inside the cave, which was quite comfortable, and was given a single-page daily newspaper published there to read.</p>
<p>The next morning, someone told him that Mr. Yan had agreed to meet. The reporter met with Mr. Yan in another cave, with walls full of maps, which was the location of the staff headquarters. Mr. Yan sat at the head of the desk, wearing glasses, with gray hair and a peaceful expression. He was wearing a blue military uniform of Shanxi Province. To Mr. Yan's right was his chief of staff, Mr. Zhu, a burly man wearing a yellow wool uniform of a central military officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan stated, "Japan is strong and China is weak, but we must deal with them closely. Therefore, some people have reformed their strategy and plan to use our strength to attack the weak points of the Japanese. We have now begun a war using the strength of the people of the whole country, and are training soldiers and civilians according to three methods: (1) giving officers special training, (2) training the people, and (3) training the army in guerrilla tactics. At present, China is proceeding in accordance with the following four principles: (1) unity and cooperation between soldiers and civilians, (2) unity between officers and soldiers, (3) seizing opportunities to attack the enemy, and (4) avoiding unnecessary losses."</p>
<p>"One million Shanxi people are currently in training to help the national army break the Japanese barrier. Most of their training is on the political front. We must explain the significance of this war to them, unite them, and give them weapons. They have now made the Japanese rule ineffective. Every time the Japanese occupy a place, the local government and post office move slightly backwards and continue their duties. In Shanxi Province, of the 105 counties, except for the three northern ones that have been merged and governed by one county magistrate, each of the remaining counties still has a county magistrate who exercises his duties according to regulations. Even most of the so-called Han traitors are not truly traitors. Many of them are serving us."</p>
<p>"Shanxi is currently actively preparing for a long-term guerrilla war. There are already a large number of regular troops moving behind the Japanese army and surrounding them, and they have established self-sufficient bases in the mountains. These troops can rely on the countryside for all their needs except for military supplies, because the assistance of the people is readily available. Full attention is being paid to estimating the supply of military supplies."</p>
<p>"There are currently more than fifty divisions of troops in the occupied areas of Shanxi Province, two-thirds of which are regular troops. In the past two weeks, more than 240 battles have occurred within this theater, and more than 10,000 Japanese soldiers have been annihilated. The new strategy now is to avoid large-scale battles, so the above-mentioned are only small conflicts. Because the railways are often cut, the Japanese have begun to build piers along the railway lines, which the Chinese army is preparing to attack. In short, the Japanese will never be able to gain true control of Shanxi."</p>
<p>When Mr. Ge went to the cave where the talks were held, he walked on a specially prepared strong trail back to his residence (Sent from the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, March 10).</p>

<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 22nd] Foreign Minister Arita stated today in response to a question in the House of Peers that "Japan will consider abolishing extraterritoriality and returning the concessions in China. When the opportunity for Japan to return the Japanese concessions arrives, I believe that foreign countries will also return their concessions in China." Referring to Shanghai, he said, "The Shanghai Public Concession and the Japanese authorities have a specific agreement to allow Japanese police to cooperate with the Concession authorities to suppress terrorists. The Japanese side is also planning a similar cooperation with the French Concession, and we hope to achieve effective results."</p>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 23rd] The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Fessenden, protested today to the Italian Consul because the Italian side allowed Chinese members of the Japanese military police to operate in the Suzhou Creek area of the Italian military defense zone.

<h3 id="e10">Military Commission Political Department Drafting Outline for Commemorating the Martyrs of Huanghuagang <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 23rd] The Military Commission Political Department recently drafted the following general outline for commemorating the March 29th Huanghuagang:</p>
<p>Meaning</p>
<p>March 29th is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. It was approved by the Fifth Central Standing Committee Meeting on March 1, 1938. The heroic feat of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang on March 29th was a great cause that promoted the Xinhai Revolution and laid the foundation for the Republic of China.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>The course of March 29th, the Battle of Huanghuagang on March 29th, was the continued uprising after the failure of the Guangdong New Army uprising two years before the founding of the Republic of China. The location was in Guangzhou, and the planning agency for the uprising was located in Hong Kong, with Huang Xing as the commander-in-chief. Xie Shenmu raised tens of thousands of shields from overseas Chinese in Nanyang for funding. During the uprising, Huang Xing led more than a hundred comrades and attacked the Governor-General's Mansion. Later, due to the Guangdong Governor Zhang Mingqi dispatching troops to besiege, it quickly failed. After the failure, the Qing government implemented even greater terrorist policies, and party members and civilians with cut hair were arrested and killed in large numbers. However, the greater the oppression, the fiercer the resistance. The principles have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, and the revolutionary trend cannot be stopped. Therefore, the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th was launched to carry forward the unfulfilled ambitions of the predecessors and lay the foundation for the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The task of commemorating "March 29th"</p>
<p>(1) It is necessary to inherit the spirit of perseverance and heroic struggle of the revolutionary martyrs of "March 29th," firmly establish the belief that "the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built," not seek temporary comfort, not be greedy for difficulties, and carry out the war of resistance to the end. All national agencies and groups must widely and deeply publicize the facts and spirit of the sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and the martyrs to the officers and soldiers of the entire army and the people of the whole country, implement the national spiritual mobilization, so that everyone deeply recognizes that the final victory will surely belong to our country, understands that "compromise midway is destruction," firmly establishes their belief, and encourages them to participate in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>(2) The correct leadership and great sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs created the Republic of China. At present, Japanese imperialism not only wants to destroy our country, but also wants to destroy our nation. At this time, when we commemorate the martyrs, we must first take the revolutionary martyrs as an example, thoroughly understand the Three Principles of the People and all the legacy, and the leader's instructions and speeches on the war of resistance, and strive to achieve them. Second, we must encourage everyone to actively enlist in the army, rise up to participate in the war of resistance work, drive out the Japanese, and recover the lost territories.</p>
<p>(3) One of the political visions of the revolutionary martyrs was to be able to use the internal contradictions of the Qing government in the successive uprisings to overthrow the Qing court, go deep into various places, and win over the Qing government's troops. Now that we are fighting against the Japanese, we should also step up propaganda against the Japanese puppets, encourage them to go to the rear of the Japanese, and win over the puppet troops to disintegrate the Japanese.</p>
<p>(4) One of the great understandings of the revolutionary martyrs was to advocate equality and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups in the country. At present, our sacred war of resistance is not only a war of resistance for the whole people, but also a war of resistance in which all ethnic groups in the country are united. This is to step up the awakening of the minority ethnic groups in the country, strengthen the unity of the minority ethnic groups in the country, and respond to the Japanese conspiracy to divide us.</p>
<p>(5) The revolutionary martyrs carried out continuous propaganda and organization movements among overseas Chinese, and repeatedly received great assistance from overseas Chinese. From this enthusiastic assistance, we must never ignore the status of overseas Chinese in the war of resistance. In fact, overseas Chinese have also contributed great strength since the war of resistance. We should also strengthen our work with overseas Chinese, especially to make full use of the capital of overseas Chinese to carry out the construction of the national defense economy.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 22nd] Tianjin News: In the name of searching for legal tender, Japanese troops in Tianjin have been strictly inspecting pedestrians and vehicles entering the concessions outside the concessions since the 16th. All those carrying legal tender and central auxiliary coins are detained, and the currency is confiscated.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] After the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army from Shanghai, the files of the Shanghai Land Bureau were entrusted to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession for safekeeping. Now, as the reorganized Land Bureau lacks these archives and cannot function, it has earnestly requested that [the KMT] negotiate with the Public Works Department for their return. The Public Works Department, refusing to recognize the puppet organization, has sternly declined, stating that it will not hand over these archives to anyone without the consent of our central government.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] A certain foreign reporter, using a Japanese official title for Foreign Minister Wang, claimed that he had already resigned and gone to Hong Kong, and that the reason for his resignation was due to differences of opinion with the central government. This agency specifically inquired at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to verify the truth. Foreign Minister Wang happened to be at the ministry and graciously granted an interview, stating that this was purely a fabrication and not worth a smile. Last December, [the Japanese] claimed that he had gone to Hanoi, and now they say he has resigned and gone to Hong Kong. In reality, since arriving in Chongqing from Wuhan at the end of last July, he has not taken a single step away from Chongqing. The Japanese rumors are self-defeating. As for his handling of foreign affairs, it is entirely based on the central government's policies, and he deeply believes that the current policies of the central government are the only path to resisting the Japanese and building the nation. The claims that he has differences of opinion with the central government and has already resigned are all groundless, deceptive words intended to deceive others.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Diplomatic circles here have received reliable reports from the Chinese mainland stating that China's unity is growing stronger. Chiang Kai-shek will likely support the war for an indefinite period. The tension in Europe will not affect China's war of resistance, as large quantities of military supplies continue to flow into China from the Soviet Union. Throughout the country, there is increasing trust in the central government. The Japanese deployment of troops on the Soviet border is not worth emphasizing, as Japan would not dare to act rashly unless an incident occurs in Europe.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd] The ongoing thrift and donation movement has seen enthusiastic participation from all walks of life. Prisoners of war in the XXXXX POW camp were deeply moved upon hearing this. Prisoners such as Zhongshan Bao voluntarily requested permission to participate in the donation movement by "reducing their food consumption" to express their sincere sentiments. Zhongshan Bao donated one yuan from five days of reduced food expenses, while Xia Jiulang and others donated a total of two yuan and eight jiao from two days of reduced food expenses, and three yuan and eight jiao from clothing expenses. Zhongshan Bao also wrote an article on thrift and donation, describing the great significance of the donation movement. A translated version is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the camp director, "Dear Chinese comrades, I heard that you are practicing thrift and donation. After hearing this, I immediately requested the camp director to reduce my living expenses to sanction the violent Japanese militarists and financial cliques who are disrupting East Asia and continuing their war of aggression. I also practice donation. After being permitted, I will now practice and say a few words that everyone knows. During the European War, how did the French people work in the rear and work for national salvation? To save the country, even if they fall into poverty, they don't 'complain'. Everyone practiced economy. From spring to autumn, they wear simple clothes as much as possible, almost naked. Everyone is diligent in their duties and strives for production. The harvest from farming is distributed as follows: for example, out of four bags of wheat harvested, three bags are used for agricultural taxes, fertilizer costs, food, etc. The remaining one bag is used for thrift and donation. After that, they eat barley or oats to maintain their family livelihood. They truly forget all poverty for the sake of the country's future, until they win the war, achieve true peace, and the people's comfort and happiness are also achieved. For the sake of the comfort and happiness of the Chinese and Japanese people and the peace of East Asia, I am willing to be a sacrifice and strive to defeat these imperialist militarists and financial cliques. This is what I swear to my dear Chinese compatriots. Social life is infinite. For China, which has a thousand years of historical culture and is admired, for the eternal peace and true happiness of the people of East Asia, and to wish the Chinese army, which is fighting hard, victory, I believe that a unified country practicing thrift and donation is more important than anything else. This is what I sincerely hope. I hope that my dear Chinese compatriots will redouble their efforts to encourage and implement thrift and donation for the great victory and peace of East Asia in the future, as well as for the comfort and happiness of the people living in hardship. This is what I silently pray for and request before my Chinese compatriots. March, 28th year of the Republic of China, Zhongshan Bao."</p>
<h3 id="e20">Weekly Battle Situation on All Fronts: From March 16th to March 22nd <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>—Announced by the Military Affairs Commission—</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that there have been no large-scale battles on the northern and southern fronts this week. The Japanese army is likely exhausted and is engaging in replenishment and adjustment in an attempt to re-offend and struggle for the life of its country. However, under the situation where our entire army is taking advantage of the Japanese army's weaknesses, and secretly depleting the Japanese army, the Japanese army has suffered extremely deep damage and is also worthy of reporting. In terms of the overall war situation, it can be described as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the area has been mobilizing frequently recently, purely to create a false impression. On the one hand, they are stepping up the construction of defensive works on the West River, Yuehan, and other lines. In Haikou and Xiuying on Hainan Island, they are rushing to build forts. In Wenchang, Ding'an, and Yaxian, they are opening up aircraft warehouses and airfields to establish air force bases, as if to be trapped and occupy them for a long time. As for sporadic battles, our two armies have engaged in fierce battles in XXXXX, Daliang, XXXXX, Anding, Wenchang, and Qiongshan. In the Battle of Qiongshan, Japanese Colonel XXXXX was killed. Japanese aircraft also flew repeatedly to Qingyuan, Daqiu, Luotang, Hengshi, Lidong, and other places in England to carry out indiscriminate bombing. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army blindly dropped bombs, and our losses were minimal. At present, the Japanese army on all fronts is under our absolute control and cannot make progress.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Front</p>
<p>The Japanese army invading Mount Lu has been repeatedly severely damaged by our army and has been quiet for many days. A few days ago, a remnant of the Japanese army, covered by six aircraft, once again moved towards Jianghanpo, attempting to invade XXXXX Ridge. After our defending army met with fierce resistance, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. Our artillery fired accurately and damaged one Japanese aircraft. The Japanese army was defeated in a panic and gained nothing. The battle of Duchang is still very fierce. After our counterattack to capture XXXXX County, we continued to capture XXXXX Daji. The Japanese army, which continued to land on the South Lake surface, was greatly frustrated. Another four or five hundred Japanese troops landed at XXXXX Liudeng, east of Dean, across the lake from Wucheng Town, attempting to spy on and echo each other. They were heavily damaged and killed by our fierce artillery fire. The Japanese army on the north bank of the Xiushui River fired more than a thousand shells at Yao Lin Gou XXXXX Ridge from the afternoon of the 17th, most of which were XXXXX tear gas shells. They used 500 infantry to cross the river in the vicinity of ShanjXXXXX, Macun Guanxige Chencun, with a tendency to invade Tujiapu. After our brave counterattack, the fighting was extremely fierce, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. They are still fighting.</p>
<p>Shanxi Front</p>
<p>More than a thousand Japanese troops trapped in Fushan in eastern Jin have been constantly attacked by us in the past ten days. The Japanese have suffered many casualties, and most of them have fled west. More than 500 Japanese troops remaining in XXXXX were besieged by our army on the afternoon of the 17th. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than 300 Japanese troops were killed. The remaining Japanese troops were unable to support themselves and fled towards Linfen. At 7:00 p.m. that night, we captured the county seat. In An'yi, XXXXX County, and other places in Jin, our armies have engaged in repeated engagements. In the Battle of Lingjin on the afternoon of the 19th, Su Chaoqun's unit of the puppet imperial army, which had a thousand fully equipped soldiers, took the opportunity to revolt and defect to our side when our army approached the Japanese position. The Japanese were attacked from both sides and suffered hundreds of casualties and have been in decline ever since. Since we captured XXXXX County on the 11th, the Japanese launched a counterattack on the 19th, with fierce artillery fire. Our army fought the Japanese army all day with a determination to die. The positions changed hands several times. At the same time, another unit of our army took advantage of the Japanese army's dispersed forces and launched a surprise attack on Jingle, north of the city, annihilating more than 300 Japanese troops. Jingle is still under our siege.</p>
<p>Henan Front</p>
<p>The Japanese army stationed in Shuiye Town, Anyang, led by Japanese Captain XXXXX Yamamoto, launched an attack on XXXXX Town at noon on the 19th. Our garrison troops and local militia resisted, and after XXXXX hours of fierce fighting, more than 200 Japanese troops were killed, and Yamamoto was also killed at the same time. The remaining Japanese troops were unable to support themselves and fled in panic. Now they have directly attacked Shui Zhi, which can be captured immediately. The Japanese army stationed in XXXXX fired artillery shells at Nanhedu, Gong County, Xishui, Xishui Village, and the railway station on the 16th and 17th. After our army returned fire, the Japanese army was suppressed. Another elite unit of our army also attacked the back of the Japanese army on the north bank of the Hebei River. The Japanese were killed and injured severely, and the remnants fled towards Wuzhi Qinyang. A unit of the Japanese army in Sanliuzhai, northwest of Zhongmu, launched an attack on Laitongzhai at noon on the 19th. After five hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese were unable to support themselves and fled back. We took advantage of the victory to advance to Yangqiao, annihilating more than 100 defenders. We captured the area. The Japanese army dispatched a large number of reinforcements from Kaifeng and launched a fierce counterattack, releasing a large amount of gas. Our army, because the army was destroyed, still withdrew back to Laitongzhai to engage in XXXXX. In the evening, the Japanese army came like a tide. Because the number of people was vastly different, we temporarily withdrew from the village and are now actively arranging new positions and reinforcements for a counterattack.</p>
<p>Central Hubei Front</p>
<p>Since the fall of Zhongxiang, the Japanese army has been actively building the Hanyi Jingzhong highways and rushing to build fortifications in the Yangzi (ten kilometers north of Zhongxiang) Jinmenchong (twelve kilometers north of Yangzi) area to engage in solid defense. Therefore, the war situation on this front has been silent this week. However, the Japanese army in Duobao XXXXX constantly shelled Shayang on the opposite bank in an attempt to probe. After our shelling, we actually hit the Japanese powder magazine. The Japanese suffered surprisingly heavy losses. The Japanese at the Sigan ferry in the southeast of Duobao once tried to land at Zhang XXXXX and Hongmiao, on the west bank of XXXXX between the XXXXX and XXXXX on the 15th, 17th, and 18th. After our army’s painful attack, the Japanese XXXXX suffered extremely heavy casualties and failed to succeed. Now, in each of these areas, there is no trace of the Japanese army, and the rest is still river artillery warfare, forming a confrontational state. The attempt to consolidate the east bank of the Xiang River has been extremely difficult for the Japanese army under the four-sided attack of our army. We have been attacking Xiang XXXXX for several days, our artillery fire is fierce, the Japanese position has been completely destroyed, and 200 Japanese have been killed. Another unit of our army captured Wangjiang County on the 16th, killing countless Japanese troops. On the 19th, our army in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, west of Jiangsu, fought fiercely with more than a thousand Japanese troops at Huangkou XXXXX Station, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. The Japanese fled in panic. Above Zhenjiang, in the Zhengjiazhuang area, more than 2,000 Japanese troops surrounded us in eight directions. After our officers and soldiers fought on separate routes, they killed more than 600 Japanese troops. The Japanese suffered heavy losses and retreated. After these battles, the Japanese so-called Jiangsu-Anhui sweep plan was completely shattered, and our strategy of turning the Japanese rear into the front has proven its effectiveness.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Anglo-French Military Cooperation: Prevents Germany from Dominating Central Europe, Progress Made in Peace Conference <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] According to a special correspondent from Havas in London, after consultations between British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday afternoon, they unanimously agreed that Britain and France must stand up to prevent Germany's attempt to dominate Central Europe. It is reported that Bonnet has sent a written promise to the British government, expressing France's readiness to participate in Anglo-French cooperation in any way without restriction. The correspondent further said that Britain and France will provide mutual assistance in the event of German aggression, which is also clearly stated, and will be automatically implemented at that time, even if the attack is indirect and comes from the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland. This move will not change.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 22nd] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in London for an hour and a half this evening to discuss the international situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 23rd] According to sources in political circles, after discussions between Chamberlain, Halifax, and French Ambassador to Britain Corbin, there has been progress in convening an anti-aggression conference. Several countries will participate in this conference, but there is no definite news yet. However, political figures generally believe that the nine countries of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Romania will participate. The Scandinavian and Baltic countries may also be invited to participate. The purpose of the conference is to unite all countries to maintain peace.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The four-power declaration proposed by Britain for Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, expressing that if Germany takes further action, joint action will be taken. The Soviet Union and Poland have not yet replied. The drafting of this declaration was completed on Sunday and awaits responses from the governments. There may be revisions to it, so it must wait for several days before it is completed. Britain is also deeply aware of the difficult position Poland is in, and hopes that Poland's wishes can be achieved. The nature of the aforementioned declaration is only that if the situation in a country other than the United States is threatened, the declaring countries will immediately discuss countermeasures. This can also be regarded as a prelude to future substantive steps for countries to discuss.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 23rd] The official here recently published a statement, implicitly hinting that if Germany's power extends outward from Memel again, it will conflict with Poland's interests. The statement solemnly declared that Poland considers the Baltic Sea region to be directly related to Poland's interests.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] Polish Foreign Minister Beck today received the British Ambassador and the French, German, Romanian, and Hungarian envoys. Observers here believe that Poland's situation is extremely difficult. The fate of Memel has made Poland even more uneasy about Germany's encirclement. Publishing a declaration of ill will towards Germany will inevitably lead to unfortunate consequences, especially as Germany respects Poland's position in Danzig and Pomerania, which is also due to Poland's non-alignment with policies against Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] It is generally believed that when the British Ambassador met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck today, he presented the UK's new proposal for a joint anti-aggression declaration.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 23rd] Secretary of Commerce Stanley said that the situation caused by recent political developments has made it impossible for Anglo-German commercial negotiations to make further progress.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] German troops departed from East Prussia at exactly 5:00 this morning and entered Memel. The Memel Nazi XXXXX and XXXXX greeted them. When they passed through various villages and towns in Memel, they were XXXXX characters. The villagers watched with interest. Foreign Minister XXXXX Bente Zapf and Lithuanian Foreign Minister signed an agreement at midnight on the XXXXX, assigning Memel back to Germany, and issued an official report stating, "The two countries will not use force against each other and will not assist a third party that attacks either side."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tilsit, East Prussia, 23rd] German troops were scheduled to cross the border and enter Memel at 5:00 this morning. German mechanized troops also drove into the area. It takes about two hours to drive from the border to Memel, a journey of 60 miles. German troops entering the country are properly arranged to wait for Hitler's arrival. German farmers in the territory raised German flags to welcome the troops. The border XXXXX was opened at 7:00 last night. The Governor-General of East Prussia XXXXX gave a speech here. Today, all walks of life in Tilsit are taking a holiday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Hitler changed from taking the fire ship to taking the waterway today, taking the Swinermunde warship to Memel, escorted by a fleet of cruisers and destroyers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Memel, 23rd] Hitler arrived here after 1:00 p.m. today, not as previously reported at 9:30 this morning. After Hitler arrived here, he drove to the theater square to answer the cheers of the crowd. He gave a speech to the people of Memel, saying, "I led you back to the motherland. You have never forgotten the motherland, and the motherland has never forgotten you. You were abandoned by a weak Germany, and now you have returned to a strong Germany. The world may express dissatisfaction with this matter, but the population of the new Germany is now 80 million. Our unity will never be broken, and no other country can break our unity. Twenty years of suffering can be our lesson. We do not want to harm others, but we will never tolerate the harm others inflict on us. XXXXX We have achieved our goal of revenge. I wish you the youngest citizens of the Greater German Reich." Hitler's speech lasted eight minutes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Kaunas, 22nd] Neumann Both, the leader of the Memel Germans, said at the first meeting of the new Memel Congress tonight, "Memel has been annexed to Germany." He has sent a telegram to Hitler to express his gratitude. The meeting ended with the singing of the German national anthem.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Kaunas, 23rd] Lithuania issued a special national defense law today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Germany and Lithuania signed a treaty this evening, including a non-aggression pact.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Regarding the issue of the Memel Autonomous Region, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbsys and Ribbentrop signed a treaty after negotiations. The main points are four: (1) Lithuania returns the Memel region to Germany; (2) Lithuanian troops and police withdraw immediately; (3) the area is designated as a free port for the use of Lithuania; (4) both parties agree to avoid using force and do not allow third countries to use violence against either signatory.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Kaunas, 23rd] It is reported that a number of Lithuanians have been arrested in Memel.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] The State Department remains silent on Germany's occupation of Memel. American officials are clearly less concerned about the recent Memel incident than the previous annexation of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Secretary of the Interior Sir Hoare said in a speech in the House of Commons on the 22nd, citing the Memel incident, "I have no special report on the situation in Central Europe. The Lithuanian Foreign Minister received a notice from Germany while in Berlin that it was required to immediately cede Memel. Germany threatened Lithuania that if Lithuania resisted or sought help from other countries, Germany would handle the matter militarily. This requirement is equivalent to an ultimatum, and the Lithuanian government must decide within about four days. Germany XXXXX gave assurance that if this request was accepted, it would not make any other requests. It is now known that the Lithuanian government has accepted this request. Because Lithuania has not sought help from the British government since the request was made, the Prime Minister will have a more detailed report on this matter."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Bucharest, 23rd] The city is in a state of war. Fully equipped troops are moving through the streets.

<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Mussolini will deliver a speech on Sunday, and there is much speculation about the scope of his colonial demands.

Given Mussolini's realistic understanding, he will not issue France an ultimatum-like demand or make a resolution difficult. Some parties in France genuinely want to discuss this issue with Mussolini at length. It is rumored that some individuals will shuttle between the two governments.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The French President and his wife hosted a banquet at the French Embassy here last night, entertaining the British King and Queen and over a hundred other dignitaries. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke and Duchess of Kent, Princess Royal, Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Foreign Secretary Halifax were all in attendance. A famous play was performed at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden to entertain President Lebrun. The crowds gathered outside the opera house were extremely dense. When the King, Queen, and President and his wife arrived at the theater, they were cheered loudly. Prime Minister Chamberlain was also well received. The boxes inside the theater were decorated with fragrant flowers, with roses representing England and lilies representing France. The splendor of the Royal Opera House's decorations was the greatest since the Great War.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Today, Londoners had the opportunity to enjoy the grand spectacle of welcoming French President Lebrun and his wife. The prelude began at 9:30 a.m. At noon, the French President, the British King, and the Queen, escorted by guards, traveled by car to the Guildhall in the City of London to attend a welcoming banquet. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and the Duke and Duchess of Kent were all present. After receiving the welcome and delivering a speech, the French President raised a glass in a toast, responding that the welcome he and his wife had received made him believe even more that understanding and cooperation between Britain and France had been established. The people of the two great capitals, after eight months of relations, have unanimously expressed their agreement. Finally, the French President stated, "I have heard clearly the voices of Londoners. Some of the most admirable principles in the modern world were born in these places." "The past experiences and joys of the people of Britain and France have united the two capitals and have forged the permanent unity of the two countries' friendship." Before leaving the conference hall, the French President specially presented the Mayor of London with 500 gold pounds to be used to help the poor in London.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e30">"Factionalism" and Jealousy, Narrow-Mindedness <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Today, this newspaper publishes an article by Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling), "Seven Deadly Diseases," on page two. When explaining the seven chronic diseases of our country, she specifically lists "factionalism" first and vehemently condemns the evils of jealousy and narrow-mindedness. At the current crucial moment when the Second Phase of the War of Resistance is about to begin and the prospects of national revolution are immense, it is particularly worthy of universal reflection.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also said: "All talented individuals with independent thought and personality will never demean themselves to attach themselves to curry favor. Therefore, those who focus on factionalism will certainly exclude or indirectly make it difficult for those who have not joined their faction but are working around them to feel at ease in their positions. Consequently... it cultivates corruption and decline, fosters suspicion and pettiness, and breeds baseness and selfishness, ultimately not only causing the country to gradually degenerate but also adding useless burdens to the country. In short, in factionalism, there is no unity or mutual assistance, only the instinct and impulse of a rabble." This can be considered a "penetrating critique of current malpractices." We hope that those in power will take it to heart as a warning for employing people and handling affairs.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should further recognize that in the current critical stage of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, all jealousy, narrow-mindedness, and factionalism are enough to cause internal friction, alienate national unity, hinder the future of the War of Resistance, and indirectly help our enemies and traitors. It is something we cannot tolerate for a single day. However, to thoroughly eradicate these chronic diseases and evils, on the one hand, we hope that those above will lead by example; on the other hand, and more importantly, it lies in the establishment of a democratic legal system, especially today, the provincial, municipal, and county councils must be established as soon as possible. As genuine local public opinion organs, only when public opinion is given normal expression and only when the connection between the government and the people becomes increasingly close, can all the evils of "factionalism" and jealousy and narrow-mindedness be easily discovered and eradicated.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Shuster's Travelogue <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Youngest Capital, A New Focus of European Change</p>
<p>In view of the severe trend of the Central European situation, we feel that Bain and Whitacre's description of Shuster, the capital of Carpatho-Ukraine, is particularly relevant and timely.</p>
<p>We know that Berlin's decision to rename Ruthenia as Carpatho-Ukraine is a major blow to the status quo in Central Europe. Carpatho-Ukraine is certainly not an independent country, but a province under the federal republic of Czechoslovakia. However, she enjoys a large degree of autonomy, and at present, due to her position in national communications, her autonomy has expanded significantly.</p>
<p>Ukraine itself feels that it should become the foundation of a huge force consisting of Galicia, Bukovina, Bayyin-Rabia—and, of course, the vast area inhabited by the Ukrainian people after the Soviet Union's split. Ukrainians claim that the population is at least 40 million worldwide.</p>
<p>The new capital, Shuster, is located at the eastern end of the narrow strip of the Czechoslovak Republic, very close to Hungary and not far from the Romanian border.</p>
<p>Shuster is clearly a remote market town that is not easily accessible to the general public. Looking at the map, the easiest route to Shuster is to cross the Laipei Mountains not far from Laipei and then take a train. So I went to Laipei first. But there, the border was closed.</p>
<p>Failing to go from Laipei, I tried to go from Krakow. But there, I couldn't buy a ticket to Shuster. Worse, I couldn't buy Czech silver coins because of rumors that the currency was about to be devalued, and Polish banks no longer exchanged them. But I finally exchanged five shillings and bought a military ticket across the border to Chirlina, and we were told to inquire there about the route to Shuster.</p>
<p>No one knows how to get there</p>
<p>But when I arrived in Chirlina, it was dark and raining, and no one knew how to get to Shuster. Therefore, I accepted the advice of a Hungarian traveler and ran to Budapest (Hungarian capital) to make other arrangements. From here, Shuster—the capital of a province under the Czechoslovak Republic—is very easy to reach, and without going through its own border, but through the capital of its enemy, Hungary.</p>
<p>An excellent eastward highway can take you to Ke Pa in five hours, and then take a local train to Beilegesi-Sa. There, it was originally guaranteed that you could get a bus to Shuster. But there wasn't one, so I consulted with the police, got a special pass for my driver, and drove to the border. In any case, I had to maintain a fair stance on Shuster. There, there are state-owned buses connecting to Slovenia; the latter being more common.</p>
<p>These recently ceded border cities still bear the scars of the urgent transfer of their nationality. The walls and shop fronts have been damaged, and all Czech company names and street names have been torn off and replaced with Hungarian names.</p>
<p>The temporary border (in Budapest, the border demarcation committee is still working on dividing the last line) includes two checkpoints, each with a four-wheeled truck parked in the middle of the street, as if it were a necessary gateway for entry and exit. Here, there are sentries wearing rifles, bayonets, and binoculars, guarding the roads and open spaces.</p>
<p>The Mud and Thatch of Rural Towns</p>
<p>Shuster itself is cleverly nestled beneath a small hill with many historical sites. This is a simple rural town, deeply mired in mud, and in my opinion, it looks just like Tirana, Angola twelve years ago. But in Angola, the buildings are solid and durable - here, the buildings of the new government are made of wood." "Why wood?" I asked. "Because there is a lot of wood," they said, adding, "In the old capital of Tsao Luote, we used stone to build. Here, it might be better to use wood."</p>
<p>Carpatho-Ukraine openly mourns the loss of its territory there, especially Utsho-Trot and Hei Kai-Si, where the Czech government squandered a lot of money on public buildings and schools before the Munich Conference. When I presented my pass, there was a stamp from Utsho-Trot affixed to it. The inspector painfully tore off "Utsho-Trot" and wrote "Shuster." On the other hand, Hungary is still dissatisfied, and there is a radio broadcast every night, "We will recover all the lost territory."</p>
<p>There are two hotels in Shuster, the Central and the Korona. The former is owned by a Jew, and the latter is under the rule of the "Sic" (Ukrainian Nazis). In the Central Hotel, we can still see Czech officials, merchants, Jews, and ordinary people. This can be called old-fashioned and legitimate. There are many newspapers, and what caught my attention was how anxiously the Jews surrounded "Volkskeji, Pi Peituo" (newspaper name) when the fresh newspapers arrived. A photo of President Volosin Father is hung there, and a photo of former Czech President Mai Yinlike is also hung in the Central Hotel.</p>
<p>The Simple Family of the President</p>
<p>But the Korona Hotel is the center of Shuster's active life, its guards, its reporters, and its gray-blue "Sic" uniforms. There is no photo of Mai Yinlike here, and a photo of Kono Huilai (a famous leader of the Ukrainian revolutionary movement) hangs in the management office. The sound of uniform heel-clicking can often be heard in the Korona Hotel. "Hey!"—raising a hand is the common greeting. In stark contrast to the Nazi atmosphere is the family of President Volosin Father. Apart from the local-style furniture, his residence can be said to be a comfortable residence for a presiding elder of the Methodist Church. In the living room are images of the Virgin Mary and the Heavenly Father, next to a portrait of his deceased wife, because Father Volosin belongs to the United Church, so pastors can also marry. The President's appearance and clothing are also completely like that of a presiding elder. His heart is open, and he is kind to people. He vehemently rejects any anti-Semitic sentiments. In fact, 80% of Carpatho-Ukraine's economic life is in the hands of Jews, who account for about 12% of the total population. They are completely loyal to the country.</p>

Subsequently, the Chief Secretary convened a meeting of the Finance Committee, which approved an additional expenditure budget of $414,145 for this year. (The details of important deficits have been reported).</p>
<p>Military Contribution Set at Six Million</p>
<p>In recent years, the British government has paid close attention to Hong Kong's defense, sparing no effort in military preparations. Therefore, the burden of military expenses has also increased year by year. As for Hong Kong's annual contribution to the British government's military expenses, the original provision was 20% of the Hong Kong government's annual tax revenue. In recent years, Hong Kong's defense has become increasingly fortified, and expenses have also increased compared to the past. Now, following the instructions of the British Colonial Office, the annual military contribution is no longer based on the amount of tax revenue, but is fixed at six million dollars to cover the fixed amount of military expenses. As for the increase in this fixed amount of military expenses, during yesterday's Legislative Council meeting, a letter from Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald to the Governor of Hong Kong, a letter from Mr. Lambert of the War Office to the Colonial Office, and a statement of military expenses were released. According to these documents, the British government spent a total of £1,551,508 on Hong Kong's military expenses last year, while Hong Kong only contributed £346,443. Therefore, the amount subsidized by the British government to Hong Kong reached £1,209,065. Furthermore, the aforementioned military expenses only take into account the army; the maintenance costs of the China Fleet and the British Royal Air Force have not yet been included. The figures for Hong Kong's military expenditure in each department are listed below: Military salaries: £373,304; food expenses: £39,792; educational construction: £5,677; military barracks and relocation: £48,386; land transportation costs: £151,012; land transportation costs: £169,934; uniforms: £40,639; ordinary food storage: £32,347; wartime food storage: £52,144; various projects: £331,908; active troops of all levels: £79,383; British troops: £101,999; reserve forces: £125,083; totaling £1,551,508. It is noted that in 1936-1937, the total military expenditure of Hong Kong was £1,551,508, while Hong Kong only contributed £337,020.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Amidst the Rice Shortage in Guangdong, Fellow Townsmen from Various Districts in Hong Kong Are Busy with Relief Efforts; Chambers of Commerce Allocate Funds to Expedite Sales at Fair Prices; The Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Will Ship Rice to the Mainland <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the rice shortage in Guangdong, the Central Government, in consideration of the people's food supply, has approved the tax-free import of 1.2 million metric tons of foreign rice, of which 300,000 metric tons are designated for military rations, 700,000 metric tons for Chaozhou and Shantou, and 200,000 metric tons for Jiangmen, as reported in the newspapers. After this news was released, rice merchants in Hong Kong were delighted and prepared to ship the rice to the mainland for sale. For this reason, the reporter visited various fellow townsmen associations to investigate the latest developments. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Heshan Sells Rice at Eight Jin Per Dollar</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hou Shounan, Chairman of the Heshan Chamber of Commerce, after receiving news of the tax-free foreign rice, the Heshan Chamber of Commerce immediately convened consultations with fellow townsmen who were responsible for raising funds. They all agreed that the current price of white rice in Heshan was only five liang and four qian per dollar, the situation was serious, and the poor were suffering. Shipping rice for relief was the most pressing plan. Now that the Central Government has approved 200,000 metric tons of tax-free foreign rice for Jiangmen, for the sake of rapid relief, it has been decided that the Heshan Chamber of Commerce will allocate HK$8,000, and another wealthy businessman will provide HK$8,000, for a total of HK$16,000, to purchase rice and conduct sales at fair prices back in Heshan. They have already begun purchasing and shipping, and it has been decided that the foreign rice shipped back will be sold at eight jin per dollar.</p>
<p>Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegrams to Inquire</p>
<p>Since hearing that 700,000 metric tons of tax-free foreign rice had been approved for Chaozhou and Shantou, fellow townsmen from Chaozhou in Hong Kong have been eager to purchase large quantities of foreign rice and ship it back for relief. However, the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce believed that although there was news of tax-free foreign rice, the Central Government had not yet issued a clear order. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Shantou to inquire about the truth. It was reported that the Shantou Chamber of Commerce had received a telegram from Mr. Chen Huanzhang, Chairman of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, from Qujiang, reporting that the approval of tax-free foreign rice had been verified. Once a reply is received, they will immediately begin shipping large quantities of rice back to various places in Chaozhou and Shantou to relieve the people's suffering.</p>
<p>Fellow Townsmen from Various Districts Donate Funds</p>
<p>After the Siyi Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request tax exemption for foreign rice, news emerged that they had sent people back to their counties to sell rice at fair prices. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Taishan Chamber of Commerce told the reporter that wealthy businessmen from Taishan in Hong Kong were now holding consultations, donating funds, and combining the funds remitted back to various counties by fellow townsmen overseas to purchase large quantities of foreign rice and conduct sales at fair prices back in their counties.</p>
<p>The Zhongshan Grain Committee Comes to Hong Kong Again</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Huichang, Chairman of the Zhongshan Wartime Grain Committee, again sent committee members Mr. Li Delian and Mr. Huang Jinzao to Hong Kong on the 23rd to investigate the prices of foreign rice in Hong Kong in order to purchase it and discuss fair-price sales with fellow townsmen from Zhongshan in Hong Kong. The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce decided to allocate $40,000 to conduct sales at fair prices back in Zhongshan. The representatives visited Director Gu of the Finance Department to personally present the situation of the rice shortage. The representatives returned to Zhongshan on the same day.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, a French Airlines aircraft flew from Hanoi to Hong Kong. Due to the impact of heavy fog en route, it arrived later than scheduled. According to the pilot, Mr. Tousa, the reason for the delay was due to the weather and the inadequate lighting facilities at Kai Tak Airport, which made flying extremely difficult. When approaching Hong Kong, the aircraft was forced to fly as low as 300 feet above sea level, which was the minimum altitude, so the arrival time was slightly delayed. After the aircraft arrived, the pilot and the French Airlines authorities discussed the matter with Mr. Morse, the manager of Kai Tak Airport, for half an hour. Improvements are expected in the future. It is noted that the inadequate lighting facilities at Kai Tak Airport have made it difficult for mail planes on various routes to land in Hong Kong. When the Pan American Clipper first arrived in Hong Kong, it took half an hour to land. Two weeks ago, an Imperial Airways aircraft mistakenly flew to Bias Bay. The Kai Tak Airport authorities have not yet commented on this matter.</p>

<p>Decides to Organize a Delegation to Visit Macau</p>
<p>The Federation of Hong Kong Industries held its 14th council meeting yesterday afternoon at 5 PM. Attendees included Mr. Yip Lan-chuen, Mr. Chan Lui-sheung, Mr. Hui Lap-sam, and more than ten others. Mr. Yip Lan-chuen was the chairman, and Mr. Hon Sui-hin was the secretary. After reporting on the previous meeting's resolutions, they began to discuss the agenda items. (1) Officials and gentry in Macau had previously sent a letter to the Hong Kong Manufacturers' Federation, inviting them to organize a delegation to visit Macau in order to provide guidance and improvements in promoting local goods. This issue was brought up for discussion at yesterday's meeting. As a result, it was decided to start organizing the delegation, and Mr. Hon Sui-hin, the General Affairs Secretary, was immediately appointed to go to Macau to discuss all matters. (2) Due to the recent large-scale shipping of raw materials from non-Western countries to Hong Kong for sale, the association had temporarily suspended the issuance of certificates of origin in order to prevent this. Regarding this issue, it was brought up for discussion again yesterday. It was decided to implement registration of incoming and outgoing raw materials and products. The quantity of raw materials and products must match before a certificate of origin is issued. The meeting then approved the membership applications of the Paul Yuon Zee Factory, the Ma Bo Shan Company, the Wah Sang Factory, the Kin Man Company Manufacturing Factory, and the United Rice Noodle Factory.</p>
<h3 id="e36">The Wealthy Do Not Know the Sorrow of National Subjugation! Slow Progress in the Sale of Bonds in Hong Kong; Only Seven Million Yuan in Patriotic Donations Sent Since the War of Resistance, Not Enough to Meet the Quota; Middle and Lower-Class Overseas Chinese Have Enthusiastically Fulfilled Their Responsibilities, But the Wealthy Are Still Reluctant to Contribute <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the War of Resistance, in order to concentrate financial and material resources to cope with the Japanese invasion, the financial authorities issued five hundred million yuan of National Salvation Bonds, which were distributed to various places in China and overseas Chinese communities for sale. By the summer of last year, most places in China and overseas had raised enough money and completed the sale, and the Ministry of Finance had officially announced the payment of interest. Hong Kong's quota was originally set at ten million, but it has been more than ten months since the fundraising began, and it has not yet reached the quota. The slow progress is unexpected. The reporter investigated the recent bond sales achievements and future fundraising plans with the Hong Kong fundraising branch yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Slow Bond Sales, Not Enough to Meet the Quota</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bonds began to be sold in Hong Kong in October 1938. The fundraising branch promoted the fundraising work. Under the leadership of Chief Committee Member Sir Chau To-shan, the entire Hong Kong overseas Chinese community enthusiastically purchased the bonds. The middle and lower-class overseas Chinese were particularly enthusiastic. At that time, the bond sales progressed very quickly, with an average of hundreds of thousands of yuan per month. In terms of the economic strength of the Hong Kong overseas Chinese community, the ten million yuan in bonds could have been sold out in an instant. However, most of the wealthy in Hong Kong have not taken on their own responsibilities, relying only on the middle and lower-class overseas Chinese to do their best, which has led to a gradual slowdown in bond sales. From the beginning of fundraising to the present, the total amount raised is more than seven million (this number includes various patriotic donations before the issuance of the bonds). The fundraising achievement was best in the first phase. By the end of 1938, in just three months, it had reached more than four million. From January to the end of 1939, only two million seven hundred thousand yuan was raised in one year, which was much slower compared to the progress at the beginning of the issuance.</p>
<p>The Wealthy in Hong Kong Do Not Contribute Much</p>
<p>The only reason for the slow progress in bond sales is that the wealthy are unwilling to contribute more money. It is known that there are countless wealthy people in Hong Kong who have assets of millions or tens of millions. If these people could act according to their own conscience and fulfill their personal obligations to the country, allocating one-tenth of their assets to purchase bonds, then the ten million yuan in bonds could be sold out in an instant. However, the reality is not so. The reporter has carefully examined the list of bond purchasers and found that the amount purchased by each wealthy person is surprisingly small. That is, the past seven million yuan achievement was mostly concentrated from the efforts of the majority of the working class and lower-class overseas Chinese. As for long-term bond purchases, only the working class is working hard. The wealthy purchase bonds in one lump sum and then consider their responsibilities fulfilled. In terms of the actual situation, it is truly heartbreaking. Based on the current seven million yuan achievement in bond sales, and calculating the two million seven hundred thousand yuan sold in the past year, it will take another year to reach the original quota of two million yuan in bonds.</p>
<p>Central Government Sends Personnel to Hong Kong to Assist in Fundraising</p>
<p>The reporter received news yesterday that the central financial authorities recently sent personnel to Hong Kong to assist in fundraising. The reporter specially visited Mr. Chau To-shan, the chief committee member of the branch, and asked about the future fundraising plan. Director Chau replied that he had not received news about the central government sending personnel to Hong Kong to urge fundraising. Regarding the future plan, Director Chau expressed his opinion, saying that the purchase of National Salvation Bonds is a voluntary matter. The rapid progress of bond sales in the past was due to the automatic purchase by enthusiastic overseas Chinese. The long-term bond purchases by various organizations or individuals are also based on their personal enthusiasm. Although the branch had various planned activities in the past, such as door-to-door fundraising, they could not be realized due to environmental reasons.</p>
<p>Chau To-shan Encourages Fellow Townsmen to Work Hard</p>
<p>Therefore, the only way to promote fundraising and make the bond sales achievement progress rapidly is for fellow townsmen to voluntarily purchase the bonds. Currently, there are many industrial and commercial organizations and individuals in Hong Kong who purchase bonds on a monthly basis, amounting to about $150,000 per month. It is hoped that all Hong Kong overseas Chinese will emulate this spirit of long-term struggle and work together. In particular, it is hoped that the wealthy will remember the preciousness of the country and the importance of current responsibilities, and generously contribute their wealth. Then it will not be difficult to raise the ten million yuan in an instant. The reporter further inquired about the fundraising progress of the National Bonds and National Defense Bonds. It was answered that the National Bonds are issued directly by the bank, and the branch does not need to fundraise. The branch was only commissioned by the authorities to sell them on behalf of the bank. As for the National Defense Bonds, the branch also promoted them, but the achievement was less than ten thousand yuan. In the future, when the National Salvation Bonds reach their quota, a large-scale fundraising campaign will be launched.</p>

<p>The Pan American Boeing-type giant plane, nicknamed the "Flying Hotel," after flying to Hong Kong on the 3rd of this month, was scheduled to officially start its regular flights on the 13th, carrying passengers from the east. However, due to the impact of the weather, the flight was postponed. Originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today, yesterday, according to company news, the plane has flown out of San Francisco with a large number of mails and passengers.

<h3 id="e39">Smuggling Is Rampant; The Smuggling of Illicit Liquor from Sai Kung and Other Places in the New Territories to Hong Kong Is Increasing Daily; The Customs and Excise Department Sends More Police Detectives to Intercept Along the Way <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The sale and manufacture of liquor in Hong Kong must be licensed by the Customs and Excise Department and pay the prescribed tax amount before business can be conducted. Otherwise, whether selling or manufacturing, once discovered, it will be punished for tax evasion. Smuggling and private sales are strictly prohibited. However, due to the large amount of liquor tax collected, secretly manufacturing and selling untaxed illicit liquor can often yield huge profits, leading some cunning people, despite knowing that they are violating the law, to secretly manufacture liquor and sell it secretly in order to make money. This kind of illicit liquor manufacturing is mostly carried out in rural villages in Sai Kung and the New Territories. After manufacturing the illicit liquor, they secretly smuggle it to Hong Kong and sell it to liquor stores or residents. Because its price is cheaper than taxed liquor, many who are greedy for profit are happy to buy it. As a result, the number of smugglers is increasing daily. Recently, hundreds of people smuggle illicit liquor from Sai Kung to Hong Kong every day, all taking the secluded mountain route along Kowloon City and Ngau Chi Wan. Although they travel in groups, carrying the goods on their shoulders and backs, and secretly enter the country, it is rarely known to outsiders. After smuggling the liquor to Kowloon City, they secretly hide it in a fixed place, and then carry it separately to sell it in Hong Kong and across the sea. It is now known that the Customs and Excise Department has heard about the smuggling of illicit liquor by criminals and has decided to send many detectives to patrol the key points along the mountains around Kowloon, secretly investigating and arresting the smugglers halfway in order to bring them to justice and prevent smuggling and maintain tax revenue.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Are Those Who Profit from National Crisis Feeling at Ease? A Complaint from a Patriotic Worker Regarding the "Salary Deduction for Bond Purchase" Incident <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>"Public bonds, public bonds, purchased for the long term; ten percent collected, seven-seven split. The four big bosses, completely lost their conscience! Switching the dragon for the phoenix, provincial defense bonds..."</p>
<p>If you go to the workshop or break room of ×××× Company, as long as there are a few workers there, you will see them angrily talking to each other. Each of them will be singing the above "counting rhymes"-like doggerel. One morning, it suddenly appeared in various places in the factory, written with pencil on scrap paper, in slanting and crooked handwriting. In less than a few minutes, this quite interesting ballad, recited in colloquial Cantonese, spread throughout the factory, and everyone could recite it fluently. Because of this incident, the company fired a worker, supposedly because they recognized his handwriting and said he was the one who wrote the poem.</p>
<p>"There is absolutely no reason for you to fire me like this. What evidence do you have that I wrote those words? I really didn't write them!..." the fired worker argued laboriously.</p>
<p>"Forget it!" the manager said with a sneer. "Take off your uniform and number plate, and get out!"</p>
<p>So, the worker, who had only been working for a little over a month, was forced to take off his uniform, return his number plate, and became unemployed from then on. The manager spoke loudly, discussing who was hateful and who should be fired, deliberately making the workers hear these voices.</p>
<p>"Come to collect your bond certificates and leftover change before next Monday!"</p>
<p>The cold notice was posted, and the intimidated people gradually submitted. They hesitantly and helplessly received several broken and old bond certificates from the Ministry of Finance, mixed with some provincial defense bond certificates, and a jumble of old bond certificates with unordered serial numbers. In addition, some leftover change was returned, saying it was what was left over from the purchase.</p>
<p>"Sir! Look! Is there any justice in this?" A worker found someone and poured out their suppressed feelings: "Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War not long ago, the company told us that from now on, we would only receive ninety-five percent of our wages, and the remaining five percent would be deducted by the company to buy national defense bonds. At the time, we thought that it was the responsibility of every citizen during the war to contribute money and effort. Although we are laborers who toil all year round and can hardly get enough to eat, since we are in the rear, we should tighten our belts and squeeze out some money to offer to the country. Since the company is so enthusiastic, we naturally all agreed. In this way, the company has been deducting five percent of our wages every month, and it has been seventeen months now, deducting a total of more than sixteen thousand Hong Kong dollars. Among our seven hundred or so workers, the least amount deducted from each of us is seven or eight dimes per month. We workers have, after all, sacrificed a lot of our blood and sweat for the country."</p>
<p>"However, there is one thing that we cannot but ask about. Our wages have been deducted for seventeen months, and for seventeen months, we have not seen a single receipt, nor have we seen a published number. We don't understand at all how much money we have contributed, how much money the company has bought for us, and what kind of bond certificates they have bought. When we go to the manager, the manager only reprimands you, saying that these things are none of your business."</p>
<p>"Many people are spreading rumors, saying that the company does not buy national defense bonds, but buys provincial defense bonds. They say that these bond certificates are not bought from the counter. This is what the doggerel says, 'Switching the dragon for the phoenix, provincial defense bonds,' 'ten percent collected, seven-seven split.' Those bond certificates don't have consecutive numbers, they are disordered, and they are old. At the same time, we donated Hong Kong dollars, but we bought national currency, and the amount is very different. These facts cannot but make us suspicious. We also sent representatives to the ×× branch to inquire, but the gentlemen at the branch refused to answer. Therefore, we cannot but directly negotiate with the company. We once had all the workers in seven work sections (Transportation Department, Engineering Department, etc.) sign a petition, demanding that the company publish the numbers and publish the bond certificate numbers. However, the company ignored our request. They only issued a notice saying that the remaining money—the leftover change—would be kept in the company's finance department as a deposit for the workers, and the public bonds would no longer be purchased."</p>
<p>"This is simply taking the opportunity to exploit us! It is not only deceiving us workers, but also deceiving the government. No one is willing to have our donations buried like this. Later, we sent representatives to negotiate with them again. As a result, they agreed to publish the numbers and agreed to return the change to the workers to dispose of themselves. However, another twenty days have passed now, and the numbers have not been published. Instead, those who are more knowledgeable and have a sense of justice among the workers have been fired. Now, they are also preparing to fire those representatives who have negotiated with the company. Many workers are being threatened and oppressed and dare not speak out. They quietly received the certificates and change from the finance department, not even daring to ask how much money they have contributed and how much money they should get back!"</p>
<p>"Now, the company is also planning to buy back the previously distributed bond certificates from the workers at a low price. I heard that they want to take them to another factory for other purposes."</p>
<p>"Sir, people often say that Hong Kong people are slow and not enthusiastic about buying bonds. In fact, poor people like us are very enthusiastic. Like that famous hawker charity sale, like our regular 'ninety-five percent salary deduction,' almost every factory is the same. Who says we are not enthusiastic?? It's just that some conscienceless people have buried our enthusiasm!"</p>
<p>"However, today we were deceived. We will not be fooled again a second time. We have more than seven hundred workers. We have more than seven hundred enthusiastic patriotic people. We will not be buried forever. I think the people in society will also sympathize with us. You must know that we are not conducting any labor-management disputes now, but only an act of justice against profiting from the national crisis, against deceiving the government, and deceiving the nation and the country...!"</p>
<p>This enthusiastic worker finally believed so firmly.</p>
<p>Believe that such righteous acts will unfold among all people with a sense of justice. No one can stand by and watch. This is entirely for the benefit of the country and the nation.</p>

<h3 id="e44">My Counteroffensive Military Situation Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse. Guangdong × Anxiously Holds Emergency Meeting to Cope. However, the Navy, Army, and Air Force Disagree, and the Meeting Yields No Results. × Military Is Not Confident and Decides to Expand Political Promotion <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beijiang] The southward invading × army, due to lack of troops, has been besieged and contained by our army for five months, and has become exhausted. Our military authorities, in order to eliminate the × bandits and recover lost territory, have been actively carrying out military counteroffensives for a long time, and have already made full deployments, presenting a sharp turn for the worse. Our frontline army teams have been ordered to advance towards × step by step. According to military news, Guangzhou × chieftain Ando, ​​recently, because our various armies have already launched activities and a major battle is imminent, is extremely anxious. In addition to actively increasing troops at various points and lines, building more fortifications, and opening up and repairing various road traffic to facilitate advancement, retreat, and support, he also convened navy, army, and air force officers and × chiefs from the east, west, north, and various lines in Guangzhou last week to return to the province and hold an emergency military meeting to discuss offensive and defensive response measures. It is reported that the × chiefs of Sanshui, Zhongyuan, Jiujiang, Zhishong, Wancheng, Fangchuan, Panyu, Yoshida Lin, and the × brigade and regimental commanders of Foshan, Fujita, Adachi, Katano, Fukuda, Heta, etc., were all summoned to participate. It is heard that the meeting did not result in any concrete consultation. The biggest reason is that they are limited by the exhaustion of troops and cannot mobilize a large number of troops. Moreover, the southward invading × navy and army have unresolved cracks due to disputes over meritorious service. At the time of the meeting, their opinions diverged. They could not agree on whether to defend to the death and wait for reinforcements or to continue the invasion. Judging from the recent trends of the × army at various points and lines, it can be seen that they are still wandering in a fork in the road. However, what is most noteworthy is that before they are confident in military affairs, they have decided to expand the promotion of appeasement politics in the occupied areas and actively organize puppets to use seductive methods to confuse our people in order to eliminate the national and ethnic ideology of our people. At the same time, they have also transported a large number of toxic gases to be stockpiled on the front lines of the east, west, and north of the Yangtze River, with the intention of using them at any time. Their intentions are extremely sinister. Our military authorities have ordered their subordinates to pay close attention.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Beijiang] Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Military Council, after convening a meeting of senior generals in the South China Theater in Guilin a few days ago, has a complete military plan for defense and annihilation of ×. In addition to sending a certain military officer to be solely responsible for the national defense of southern Guangdong to prevent × troops from advancing, he ordered Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, to intensify deployments for the defense against × and counteroffensives in the east, west, and north of the Yangtze River and implement them according to plan to crush ×'s conspiracy to open up the Guangdong Road. It is now reported that Commander Zhang, in order to closely monitor the actions of the × army and wait for an opportunity to launch a counteroffensive, dispatched a new-style mechanized unit south yesterday to assist the Twelfth Army Group to fortify the line of Zengcheng, Conghua, and Huaxian to prevent × from advancing north. He also ordered a certain elite unit to reinforce the area of ​​Guotai, Chibaini, and so on, so that the northwest routes would take close contact and strictly control ×. It is also reported that the × army on the Conghua line has been constantly harassing various villages in recent days. However, our defending troops and guerrilla teams have also launched attacks on × repeatedly. On the evening of the 17th of this month, our attacking troops from Chen's division launched a surprise attack on the Sanhua × camp near Xin Street. At one o'clock in the deep night, they secretly arrived at the destination and immediately used machine guns to densely strafe the × camp. The × soldiers, hearing the sound, got up to resist. Our soldiers bravely waved their weapons and charged into the × camp. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, × could not hold on and was wiped out, killing more than a dozen people. The remaining × fled in a panic, abandoning more than twenty long and short guns and one light machine gun. Our army returned to its original defense after completing its mission. The next morning (the 18th), × divided its forces and sent infantry to search and seize villages in the nearby area to vent its anger.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] The Guangdong provincial authorities, in order to implement social military training by the central government, aim to mobilize the people to defend themselves, promote national conscription, and enrich the military strength for the war of resistance. It is especially important for the effective use of self-defense teams. Commander Zhang of the Fourth War Zone convened a symposium of responsible personnel from the Guangdong Party, government, and military to discuss the organizational training plan for social training and self-defense groups. Regarding the team aspect, the provincial government convened a provincial military conference in February, gathering guerrilla commanders from various districts to implement the original decision plan. At this moment, regarding the improvement of social training work, the provincial government has decided to quickly rectify it and hold a provincial military training conference at the end of this month, issuing a circular ordering the chief and deputy captains of social training in each county to attend on schedule and report on the social training work in their respective counties as a basis for improvement. The improvement plan is based on the three principles set by Commander Zhang: (1) How to integrate the organization and training of self-defense teams with social training? (2) How to integrate the organization and training of self-defense teams with the promotion of conscription? (3) How can the organization and training of social training and self-defense teams establish a foundation for guerrilla warfare? We must strive to give full play to the functions of social training, strengthen the people's armed forces, enrich the source of soldiers, and shoulder the mission of a protracted war of resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Eastern River Defense Is Getting Stronger Day by Day. Liang Zhu Talks About ×'s Inability to Invade the East. × Planes Harass Various Places in the Eastern River in the Rain for Days. According to Dongguan, the Number of × Troops in Shilong Has Been Decreasing Day by Day <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Huiyang] The × army in the Eastern River, because of its weak strength, is afraid of our attack. It often makes a show of force and transfers troops frequently to cover up and confuse our vision. Those who do not understand the tricks of the × army mistakenly think that there is something going on when the × army increases troops in one place. Therefore, the Eastern River changes due to the frequent increase and decrease of the × army, and the situation is also tense and relaxed. The following is a record of the latest information obtained in the Eastern River.</p>
<p>Liang Zhu Talks About ×'s Inability to Invade the East</p>
<p>The × army in the Eastern River has been moving frequently recently, so the atmosphere seems tense again. The reporter met Liang Zhu, deputy commander of the Third District Guerrilla Column, yesterday and asked him about everything. According to him, it has recently been rumored from other places that × has increased troops from Humen, and the strongholds in Shilong and Dongguan have plans to invade Huiyang. However, our headquarters has recently obtained information from various sources that × is unable to invade the east due to its weak forces, which are not enough to allocate for defense. Therefore, × often transfers troops back and forth at various points and lines. Judging from the current situation of ×, it is judged that × will definitely not be able to invade the east. We have deployed strong forces and strictly defended all lines in the lower reaches of the Eastern River. All the highways of Bozeng, Huizhang, Huidan, and Huifu have been destroyed. The headquarters has also sent its advisors, Fang Guwen, and Deputy Officer Jiang, to various places in Huibo to inspect and instruct the branch teams. Therefore, the situation in the Eastern River is currently very stable. According to another report, the × army in the Eastern River, except for slightly increased troops in Zhucun and Xiancun, Zengcheng, the number of × troops in Wancheng, Shilong, Taiping, and Shitan has decreased compared to last week.</p>
<p>Teams Protect Commercial Transportation</p>
<p>According to a report from Shenzhen, the scattered soldiers, bandits, and robbers in Lilang, Buji, Guanlan, and Pinghu in Dongbao counties looted everywhere a month ago, causing huge losses to villagers and merchants traveling to and from the area. Now, the Fourth District Guerrilla Headquarters believes that this area is the thoroughfare of transportation in Dongbao. Merchants and civilians from Dongguan, Boluo, Baoan, and other places must pass through this area every day along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to go to the British territory to buy and sell goods. In order to protect transportation and maintain wartime security, the headquarters specially ordered the Luokun unit of the ×th Brigade Guerrilla Team to go to Zhangmutou, Lincun, Tangtou, Buji, and Li Peng to defend and be responsible for the security along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and protect travelers. As a result, the local bandits and scattered soldiers have disappeared, so many villagers in the lower reaches of the Eastern River have been traveling back and forth along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway through Baoan to the British territory to transport goods in recent days, and no robberies have occurred.</p>
<p>× Planes Harass Various Places for Days</p>
<p>It has been dark for days, and the weather is often cloudy and rainy. On the 21st and 22nd, batches of three or two × planes flew from the direction of Humen to reconnaissance in Dongbao and Huige. They flew low over Masi, Longjiao, Qishi, Qiaotou, Longgang, Shawan, and Tangxia, seeming to be reconnoitering. Also, two × warships were found cruising on the sea off Xixiang, Baoan County, on the afternoon of the 22nd, but there were no unusual movements. Around five o'clock, they sailed overseas. The situation in Dongshi is as usual, and the people are also very calm.</p>

We Divide Our Troops Into Three Routes to Approach Daliang <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Rongqi] Since Daliang × was severely damaged by our counteroffensive, × knows that the strength of our team is not weak. On the 21st and 22nd, it continued to mobilize troops and increase guard posts. In Shatou, because it is facing our army across the river, it is afraid that we will cross the river and attack at night, so the number of × troops has increased even more. According to the intelligence of the ×th Detachment of the First Guerrilla Area, four small cannons and eight heavy machine guns have been added to Shatou, which shows how much it is on guard.</p>
<p>Shatou × Army Is Counterattacked by Us</p>
<p>In Rongqi, although it has been bombed by × planes, it will never affect the fighting will of our stationed troops. × also learned that our team in Zhongshan, led by Yuan, is the most effective in combat and that the one who attacked Bigian Street in Daliang was this unit. It even sent planes to Xiaolan for days to distribute leaflets, intending to seduce our soldiers and civilians to shake our military will. However, our team is increasing day by day, and its morale is extremely high, which cannot be instigated by ×'s poor skills. At this moment, the army in Rongqi is gathered, taking advantage of the advantageous terrain, it can attack and defend. × made three reconnaissance attempts on the 22nd, all of which were counterattacked by us with dynamic tactics. × cannot only invade Rongqi from Shatou, but also has the risk of being flanked at any time, and cannot take care of both ends.</p>
<p>Divide Troops into Three Routes to Approach Daliang</p>
<p>The reporter met Qu Renzhe, the chief staff officer of the Headquarters of Another Team, yesterday and inquired about the situation of × and us. According to him, in the battle of the counteroffensive against Daliang a few days ago, our headquarters was about to solve ×, but it failed due to the late arrival of a certain unit. However, our team is determined to recover Daliang. Each team is in close contact. Now, it has divided its troops into three routes, using its familiarity with the terrain to detour and approach the four parts of Daliang. The encirclement has been formed. The officers of each department have set off to command a major joint campaign, and they will not rest until they achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Starving People Everywhere Peel Bark</p>
<p>I was ordered by the Federation a month ago to return to Qiong secretly. However, at that time, the ports of Hainan were blocked by ×, so I was forced to stay in Guangzhou Bay for more than ten days. Later, I risked taking a small fishing boat back to Qiong. After many hardships, I arrived in Jiaji. After Qiong was occupied by ×, overseas transportation was completely cut off. Therefore, all supplies that used to be provided by overseas have disappeared, especially food. Moreover, there was a crop failure in Hainan last year, and now the supply has been cut off again, so the rice shortage is very serious. Starving people peel bark and eat grass roots to fill their stomachs, which is almost everywhere. Therefore, it is urgent to find ways to transport rice imports for relief today. There are many refugees who have escaped from Guangzhou Bay. However, those who have escaped are all wealthy people who rent houses or live in hotels. Therefore, although there is a refugee camp in Guangzhou Bay, no one lives there. Therefore, there is no need to start relief efforts in Guangzhou. Those who urgently need relief are the people who have not escaped and are starving.</p>
<p>Many Want to Go to Nanyang but Lack Funds</p>
<p>Now, the refugees who have escaped from Guangzhou Bay have nothing to do and many want to go to Singapore and other places in Nanyang to make a living. However, the price of ship tickets to Nanyang has suddenly soared recently, and even third-class berths are as high as two or three hundred yuan. Many of those who want to go to Nanyang are discouraged because of this. I hope the Federation can find ways to subsidize or negotiate with shipping companies to lower the ticket price so that those who aspire to develop abroad will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>After receiving the report from the representative, the Federation has decided to convene a plenary meeting of Qiong Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong during the day to discuss relief matters.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Zhang Guoquan Talks About the Battle History of Li Bai. Enlisted in the Army Early and Made Achievements <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Military and political personnel in Guangxi all know "Teacher Zhang." He is from Yangshuo and was the teacher of Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, Huang Shaoxiong, and others in their youth. Even now, they still call him "Teacher Zhang." Therefore, everyone also calls him "Teacher Zhang" instead of his name. Perhaps he is the only surviving teacher of the four of them. The writer did not want to miss the opportunity to visit him. Teacher Zhang's residence is on County Front Street, less than fifty steps away from the county government. It faces west and east and is a stone-clad house with two bays. It is obvious that it was built not long ago. A strong child handed me my name card. At first, I thought he was Teacher Zhang's grandson, but later I learned that he was his only beloved son. Before long, the servant brought tea and cigarettes. Then, "Teacher Zhang," wearing a gray silk wide robe and cloth shoes, came out of the building in the second courtyard to meet me. Although he is already in his fifties or sixties, he has not yet grown old. He looks at least ten years younger than his age. His steady pace and the firm handshake show that he had a military life in his youth. The writer first expressed his greetings and explained the purpose of the visit. Teacher Zhang graduated from the first class of the Baoding Xiehe Class, the predecessor of the Baoding Military Academy, at the end of the Xuantong Dynasty. The governor was Duan Qirui, and the supervisor was Qu Tongfeng. There were infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, and baggage departments. He graduated in two and a half years. After the second class of the Xiehe Class graduated, it was renamed Baoding Military Academy. During the Xuantong years, he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and returned to China with Cai Songpo from Yunnan and Zhuang Yunkuan from Jiangsu. He founded a primary military school in Guilin, Guangxi. Li Bai and the two Huangs were the first students of this primary school. At that time, these "outstanding students" were all teenagers in their teens, but among the more than one hundred students, he felt that they were "naturally gifted" and "diligently studied." "It is not because they are now in high positions that I am talking about old age and flattering them," Teacher Zhang said. "De Lin and Jian Sheng are indeed clever and brave. In the early years of the Republic of China, I led troops, and De Lin was a company commander under me. Once, during a battle in Hunan, his cheek was pierced by a bullet. I told him to go down, but he insisted on supporting until the task was completed before leaving the battlefield. After he recovered from his injury, a battalion commander happened to be vacant, so I promoted him. Jian Sheng unfortunately broke his leg bone when he was suppressing bandits in southern Guizhou Province. Although he was sent to Guangdong for treatment and recovered, he still limps a little when he walks now. His decisiveness was already like this in his youth." He himself said that he was originally a proletarian. The new house he lives in now was built for him last year by these "classmates." He used to live in Hong Kong and often went to Guilin after returning to his hometown. He either stayed at the Li family or ate at the Bai family." He is truly a respectable teacher. On the evening of the day the writer visited him, Teacher Zhang actually stepped on the muddy village road to visit me at the Le Society. It was truly something I dared not bear. That night, he wore a leather hat and held a thin bamboo dry pipe with a copper head. He looked a little old, but he was in good spirits. He talked about many customs and local conditions of Yangshuo. It was already dark when he left. He smiled and said, "After you come to Yangshuo to play, you should pay us some taxes." I also smiled and said, "Let's say that then." He said, "Please write more articles in the newspaper to attract more tourists for the local people." I wanted to send him back, but he insisted on refusing, saying, "In my own home, I have to ask guests to lead the way." I had to give up. Zhang also inscribed the four characters "National Golden Voice" for this newspaper. Teacher Zhang's name is Guoquan, his style name is Zhenou, and he is currently a lieutenant general and military advisor in the Headquarters of the ×th Army. He often has suggestions on military planning for Li Bai, and many are adopted.</p>

<h3 id="e52">After Bringing Five Hundred Dollars to Hollywood <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>With five hundred dollars, I arrived in Hollywood.</p>
<p>My mother started by taking out two hundred and fifty dollars. My aunt, Eloise, scraped together four hundred. Even Uncle Charles, usually known for his stinginess, surprisingly loosened his purse strings this time and gave a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>My family firmly believed the saying often seen in magazines: "If a woman wants to enter the film industry, she must have at least five hundred dollars on hand; otherwise, she doesn't need to come to Hollywood." We thought this sum could support me there for about four months. However, that was based on the living standards of our small town; in reality, it only lasted two and a half months.</p>
<p>I didn't waste a single unnecessary penny, except for the one dollar and fifty cents I spent going to Santa Anita to see the horse races. Also, I spent two dollars to buy a "von" (a type of bet) called Adam. Strangely enough, it came in first and won me eleven dollars and eighty cents. However, it rained that day at Santa Anita, and I had to buy a new hat (eight dollars), some throat lozenges (twenty-five cents), and cold medicine (fifty cents), and also get my hair done (seventy-five cents). After offsetting expenses, the actual expenditure was exactly one dollar and twenty cents.</p>
<p>My family considered this five hundred dollars the last investment in me. My grades in high school showed that if there wasn't a dedicated drama department in college, then I should just stay home and give up this ambition. At the same time, my appearance—my only tangible asset—was good enough to go to Hollywood. Another intangible asset was an unshakable belief in my heart: if I couldn't go to Hollywood, I'd rather die. Remember, this belief is the most important thing. Even if you have ten thousand dollars but lack this belief, I advise you not to come to Hollywood; it's not worth it.</p>
<p>That's how it was. Holding this belief in one hand and five hundred dollars in traveler's checks in the other, I came to this birthplace of stars. This five hundred dollars is the "hero" of my story. I want to tell you how it was spent.</p>
<p>I'm neither a contest winner nor a foreign talent specially invited by a company. No one in the film industry would welcome me. I followed others as I got off the train in Los Angeles. Carrying my large trunk and two small suitcases, I stepped onto that dirty, gloomy, noisy, and utterly terrible train station. I hailed a taxi, drove through the business district of Los Angeles, and finally stopped in front of the Actors' Apartments on La Brea Avenue. My family had already booked a room for me there (taxi fare: one dollar and fifty cents).</p>
<p>This apartment, architecturally speaking, was a very sophisticated Mediterranean-style building, but in nature, it was a Ziegfeld Follies dormitory. When I pushed the door open and went inside, I was sure I was in Hollywood. Many beautiful women inside turned their heads and glanced at me, with a hint of disdain, as if saying "country bumpkin," and then went back to their own affairs. Later I learned that they were all waiting for the phone to ring.</p>
<p>"...Comfortable and beautiful environment... spacious guest rooms... library and lounge with fireplaces... ping-pong room and candlelit dining room... every room has hot and cold water... free access to laundry room, kitchenette, sewing machine, typewriter, piano, radio, and telephone with direct lines to the studios... plentiful meals... assistance with job hunting..."</p>
<p>My single room cost thirteen dollars and fifty cents a week, with two meals provided daily. In this apartment, there were ninety-eight women who had come with the same goal as me. I could have shared a room with someone else for just eight dollars a week, but at that time, I thought my five hundred dollars was inexhaustible.</p>
<p>For the first week, besides a bit of homesickness and carefully observing everything around me, I didn't do anything. After a week, cleverly, I discovered the following:</p>
<p>First, my clothes, which were perfectly acceptable in my hometown of Henrysville, lacked three essential things here: trousers, the Mexican shoes everyone wore, and a heavy winter coat. Everyone returning from California said it was warm there and there was no need for a coat, but the evenings were unexpectedly and severely cold. No matter how beautiful a woman is, she can't stand shivering from the cold. Trousers were more practical; you could wear them anywhere. However, they had to be of high-quality material and well-tailored. A pair of trousers cost me fifteen dollars and ninety-five cents. Mexican shoes were four dollars and ninety-five cents. By a stroke of luck, I caught a big sale on a coat for twenty-nine dollars and fifty cents.</p>
<p>Second, Hollywood women value appearance more than a full stomach. They'd rather starve than neglect their makeup, which is, in reality, the only thing they can use to attract employers. Every week, I had to spend two dollars on beauty treatments. Initially, this expense made me hesitant and frustrated. Finally, my thrifty habits from my hometown succumbed to the environment.</p>
<p>Third, trying to get extra work in Hollywood without a car is simply impossible. Distances are often so far, and public transport is not very convenient. Besides, if you occasionally get a day's work fifteen miles away, how much profit can you make after paying for two taxi rides? Women in the apartment who owned cars often cleverly did a little business by giving others rides for a fee, but I didn't want to rely on others. I bought a car. In 1933, it was worth a full nine hundred dollars. Now, I bought it for one hundred and seventy-five dollars, with fifty dollars down and the rest in monthly installments of twenty dollars. It's a small, green-blue car with a removable top, and it looks decent enough. Parking at the apartment cost one dollar a day. Gasoline and oil cost about ten dollars a month. I started to get active.</p>
<p>The first place I went was the Actors' Guild at 7046 Hollywood Boulevard. There, a kind-faced clerk gave me a severe blow. He said that you can't request introductions to acting jobs unless you're a member, and to become a member, you have to have acted before or have the prospect of acting. This regulation is too harsh and unreasonable. However, for the sake of extra actors, people like me, or those who consider themselves geniuses, should indeed be prevented from intruding. Whether it's reasonable or not, my path was blocked. I had to join the guild to get acting jobs, but to join the guild, I had to have acted before. There was no way around it.</p>
<p>With less hope, I walked to the Central Casting Office on the other side of the boulevard. This time, the blow was even more severe. "Under no circumstances will we register any newcomers." Done. Clearly, I couldn't even be an extra.</p>
<p>Back on the street, I discovered that I had a flat tire. While waiting for it to be repaired (the repair cost was not fifty cents but one dollar, because it was cut by a piece of glass, which was more serious than a nail puncture), I thought that there were still several paths open to me:</p>
<p>1.  Go home.</p>
<p>2.  Visit acting agencies, agents, and public restaurants frequented by film industry people more often. Attend new film premieres. Wait at the film company gates, hoping to attract the attention of directors.</p>
<p>3.  Befriend an agent and have him introduce me.</p>
<p>4.  Do something shocking to attract world attention.</p>
<p>I gave up on options one and four and decided to try two and three. Because I lived not far from Paramount, I often lingered and waited. Finally—lucky me—I met an agent. He asked me questions very attentively and seemed very interested in me. He praised my beauty and enthusiastically handed me a business card, asking me to come to his office the next day.

<h3 id="e54">Overcoming Another Obstacle, Eastern's Hopes for Second Place are High, The Entire Team Defeated Scott 4-3 Through Hard Work <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Li Si and Shi Wei laid the foundation... Deng Qin regretted missing the open goal</p>
<p>The Group A football league has entered an intense stage these past two weeks. The Eastern Association is vying for second place and yesterday afternoon they took on Scott at the Hong Kong stadium. Although the spring rain was continuous and the weather gloomy, the fans were still keen on the game, and it did not reduce the number of spectators. Although it was not packed, it was quite crowded. The Eastern athletes finally lived up to expectations, and in several close-quarters skirmishes, they finally completed their mission and defeated the stubborn Scott team, continuing to move towards the prospect of second place. The fans, filled with hope, were all very happy.</p>
<p>For Eastern's victory this time, if rewards were given, Li Si should be first. The three forwards</p>
<p>fulfilled their duties. Only Miao Huaguo and Xu Buyun, marching in the rain, were somewhat out of sorts. The fact that Scott's forwards were able to intercept and score three goals was purely due to the weakness of the inner defense. The Scott players fought extremely bravely. Although Heer was not seen on the front line, the three forwards cooperated well and put on a good show. They were also formidable, but their progress was slow.</p>
<p>Scott was determined to contend for second place for the foreign teams, and yesterday they played with a fairly complete lineup. Not long after the start of the match, they launched a fierce attack on Eastern. Crawford and Brown crossed the ball, attacking along the wing. Seeing this, Wei Quan rushed forward to block. Crawford then passed the ball to McDonald, but it was eventually cleared by Zhongtang. Within twenty minutes, the Eastern goal was almost surrounded by the enemy like a bucket. They lost the ball several times. Fortunately, Xianhan and several defenders tried their best to resist, so they were not defeated. Then, Eastern counterattacked. Chengtuo dribbled straight up and lofted the ball high. Yu Qiaxing missed the header, which turned forward and was blocked by Deng Qin. Soon, Chengtuo won the ball again and shot hard. Deng Qin dived to block, but the ball was still not far from the goal. Deqi hooked it in with his foot, but was blocked by the defenders. In the ensuing melee, Chengtuo found an opportunity and broke through Deng Qin's defense with a shot, opening the scoring. After a while, Deqi received a cross from Bingtu, dodged Fraser, and Deng Qin, seeing that things were not going well, rushed out. Deqi was quick-eyed and quickly raised his foot from the right corner, sending in another goal. Scott lost again and again and launched a fierce counterattack. Midfielder Barnafei managed to get the ball in the chaos and lobbed it over Wei Quan's defense. He shot very well from 20 yards, giving a goal back. Scott regained a city, and their morale rose sharply. Many dangers arose in front of the Eastern goal. Soon, Barnafei again received a cross from Crawford and scored another goal, tying the score at 2-2, and the first half was soon over.</p>
<p>Changing sides, Scott's siege became even more urgent. Eastern broke through several times, but to no avail. Finally, McDonald came alone and scored a goal. At this point, Scott turned defeat into victory. The domestic fans were extremely anxious. However, the Eastern team knew to encourage themselves. Seeing that they had lost several goals in a row, they were deeply afraid that the issue of second place would become a bubble. So they raised their arms and shouted, and the whole team worked hard. The five forwards attacked at once. With the greatest effort, Deqi crouched in front of the goal, taking advantage of Wei Quan's corner kick, and headed the ball into the net. With the score tied, the team's morale was restored, and everyone fought bravely, determined to win. The two sides fought fiercely for about 20 minutes. Eastern forced another corner kick, which was blocked by Fraser. The ball fell in front of Wei Quan, who crossed it again. Deqi rushed forward desperately, using the same trick again, shaking his head and sending the ball into the net, making the score 4-3, securing the final victory and returning.</p>

<p>(Our Paper Exclusive News) The Hong Kong international football team that is going to the Philippines has already been selected by the general management committee of 15 people. Later, naval players Kan Di and Lie Li claimed that they would be going to sea with the fleet and would not be able to accompany the team at that time, so the management committee selected Hou Chengtuo and Parker to replace them. However, Parker will be returning to England soon and has also given up his right to be selected. When the management committee met the other day, it was decided to select Birodo to fill the vacancy. It is heard that Birodo has agreed to go to the Philippines. (Eastern Wind)</p>

<h3 id="e59">A Glorious Harvest for the Shanghai Chinese Football World: Lido Wins the Scott Cup, Defeating the Western Police 4-3 with a Wonderful Performance <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai News, 19th) The Lido football team, with an extremely wonderful performance and perfect cooperation, fought fiercely for 90 minutes yesterday and finally defeated the fierce Western Police 4-2 in the final to win back the Scott Cup, which the Chinese had been separated from for three years.</p>
<p>Yesterday was sunny and breezy, and the crowds numbered about 8,000, their cheers like thunder. After the game, the acting chairman of the Western Union, Mr. Bolicki, personally presented the Scott Cup, which had been held by the British Army Siem team last year, to Lido captain Li Yichen, and gave a congratulatory speech.</p>
<p>It is said that the Scott Cup has been held since 1902, and only in 1935 and 1936 did the East China team hold it for two consecutive years. The rest of the time, it has been held by Western teams. After it fell to the French Chamber of Commerce in 1937, it fell into the hands of the British Army Siem team last year. This season, Lido, with the qualifications of a Group C team, repeatedly defeated strong enemies to win the alliance, winning a lot of glory for the Chinese.</p>

<p>Fierce Battle Decides the Victory</p>
<p>Yesterday, the two sides were evenly matched and full of highlights. Lido's Xu Wenkui performed best and can be considered the number one contributor. Li Yichen also worked very hard. Cao and Zhang on the wings had good structures, especially Zhang Mingsheng's corner kicks, which were extremely accurate. Wang Kehou was inferior. The midfield line was not strong enough. Sun Jinshun, sitting in the back, repeatedly saved dangerous balls, with more merit than demerit. Zhang Linggen was still lacking. Goalkeeper Lu Zhongen still inevitably had some carelessness. Western Police goalkeeper Willie's performance was far above Zhongen's. His positioning was particularly good. The four goals he lost were really difficult to save. The center and fullbacks were out of sorts. The ball was often kicked backwards, and loopholes frequently appeared. The reason for the failure lies in this. The forward line was still active. The central forward shot fiercely. Right-winger Hootley had many wonderful moments. Left-winger Livingstone already felt old and weak. Tengdu's victory did not come easily.</p>
<p>Each Scored One Goal to Tie</p>
<p>The Western Police attacked first, with Whist and Hoot taking long shots. As soon as the deer received the ball, Wang Kehou dribbled into the territory and passed it to Cao Qiuting. Cao hooked to the middle, but Turner pulled his foot to save it. The ball flew backwards. Willie jumped up and held it, but did not make a big mistake. Lido launched a fierce attack on the enemy camp. The Western Police saved a corner kick, which was opened by Zhang Mingsheng. The angle was very good. Willie was not far away. Cao Qiuting caught up and hooked a shot, which went straight into the bottom of the net, opening the scoring. Only five minutes had passed since the start of the match. Jinshun committed a foul, and Treffi took two free kicks from 20 yards, but both went wide. Xu Wenkui got a pass from Zhang Mingsheng, but Wang Kehou could not stop him, and he missed a good opportunity. At ten minutes, Treffi attacked from the middle, lobbing to Hootley. Hoot hooked it in, and Greenburg tapped it in, the ball entering from the corner of the bottom, and the long-legged deer did not save it, so it became a 1-1 tie.</p>
<p>Xu and Wang Both Contributed</p>
<p>The Western Police's attack struck again. Hootley hooked a pass to Greenburg, who shot without waiting for the ball to stop, but it went over the crossbar. Lido advanced. Xu Wenkui passed to Li Yichen, who was blocked, and passed it back to Wenkui, who then passed it to Zhang Mingsheng. Zhang hooked it in, and Wang Kehou headed it out of bounds. The ball was kicked out from the Western Police's goal area. Treffi made a wonderful pass to Hootley, who missed the opportunity. Xu Wenkui got the ball and dribbled forward, showing his magical powers, lobbing the ball high. Turner panicked and kicked it into a corner kick, which was opened by Zhang Mingsheng. Turner headed it out, and Xu added another header, which was caught by Willie. Then Lido had another corner kick opportunity. Zhang Mingsheng repeated the same trick, passing it to Kui, who took a fierce header from 16 yards, making a great contribution. Unexpectedly, only two minutes later, Zhang Mingsheng hooked it in, and Wang Kehou rushed into the net with the ball, giving Lido a 3-1 lead.</p>
<p>The Western Police Were at a Disadvantage</p>
<p>The Western Police counterattacked, Peter shot hard, and Zhongen punched it out. Cao and Wang advanced together and passed it to Zhang Mingsheng, who shot with his left foot, but did not score. The Western Police counterattacked, but the iron leg saved the ball carelessly, kicking it into the abdomen. Peter gently passed it to Hootley, who passed it to Greenburg, but Greenburg's shot was too soft, and Zhongen threw himself to the ground to catch it. Only five minutes before halftime, Livingstone rushed in from the left and made a wonderful hook in front of the goal. Peter showed his eyes, and the Western Police finally won back a goal. Then Peter received a long pass from Jefferson, but Dai Tui blocked it in vain, and Peter shot at the goal from ten yards, but fortunately it was biased and did not hit. Li Yichen shot high at the enemy's goal, and Willie first punched it out, then caught it, and finally managed to escape danger. Before halftime ended for only one minute, Cao Qiuting took a corner kick, and Li Yichen headed it in, also making a contribution. In the first half, Lido took a 4-2 lead.</p>
<p>Lido Wins the Silver Cup</p>
<p>Changing sides again, in less than a minute, Hootley used a lightning-fast method to dribble to the baseline and cross. Zhongen blocked it, and the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down. Greenburg stood up to meet it and bumped it into the goal. The Western Police had scored 3 against 4, only one goal behind, and their attack became more urgent. The enemies of Lido galloped in the abdomen. Livingstone got the ball kicked by Sun Jinshun, rushed forward and hooked it in. Zhongsi was tall and抱球出险 , . Peter received a pass from Hootley and swept wildly, but fortunately it hit the goalpost. Seeing that the situation was not good, Lido turned to defense and attacked. Wenkui shot, and Wei He threw himself to the ground to catch it and slid away. When Yichen rushed up, the ball had already been pressed down by Willie. Jefferson took a long shot, and Greenburg headed it, but both were saved by Zhongen. At 36 minutes, Wang Kehou received a pass from Li Yichen and passed it to Xu Wenkui. Xu broke into the penalty area, but no one came to block him. At the start of 怪脚 (strange foot), he was unexpectedly deviating. Although the Western Police tried their best to tie (扎, to prickle, struggle), they were 无奈心余力细 (too weak, tired) and time passed, Lido won the championship 4-3.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Shanghai Lido Football Team Scheduled to Come South on May 5th, To Play Two or Three Matches After Arriving in Hong Kong <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Lido Football Team, champion of this year's Scott Cup (a tournament system similar to Hong Kong's Special Silver Shield Competition), achieved this glorious result as a Division C team, which is truly commendable. It can also be said that this is a unique achievement in Shanghai football.</p>
<p>However, although Lido is temporarily participating in the Division C league due to qualification restrictions (the Shanghai Foreign Football League has a regulation that newly formed teams, regardless of their talent, cannot immediately join the Division A competition, but must first participate in the Division C or reserve league, and can be promoted after achieving excellent results. Given that Lido has achieved excellent results in the Division C league and has also won the Scott Cup, there should be no problem for them to join the Division A league next season), their players are top-notch and their strength is very high. Players such as Sun Jinshun, Lu Zhongen, Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, and Tan Fuzhen have long been famous and are top players. To be honest, Lido's talent is not much different from that of the Tung Wah team, which is likely to win second place in the current Division A league.</p>
<p>The news of Lido's upcoming matches in Hong Kong has been circulating for a long time. However, yesterday, the reporter received confirmation of when they will travel south. The team recently sent a letter to a person in charge of the Eastern Athletic Association, stating that they have scheduled to travel to Hong Kong as a team on May 5th and plan to play two or three matches after arriving. The schedule and opponents for the matches will be handled by the Eastern Athletic Association in consultation with the Football Association. According to the person in charge of the Eastern Athletic Association, they plan to have Eastern Athletic Association play one match, and the Hong Kong Port Team, which has returned from a tour of the Philippines, will play the second match. However, as the Eastern Athletic Association is currently preparing for a southern expedition, the arrangements for hosting Lido's visit to Hong Kong will be planned after their return from the southern expedition.

<p>(6) Increasing Lung Capacity and Preventing Tuberculosis</p>
<p>There are many ways to transmit tuberculosis. Generally, they can be divided into transmission from close contacts and environmental transmission. Prevention of transmission from close contacts is a very broad issue, and fundamentally requires research and solutions from the perspective of relationships. As for environmental transmission, the problem is even greater. Preventive methods certainly cannot focus on one aspect alone, but require research from various aspects of the social environment in order to find a solution. As for hygiene and epidemic prevention... there will be special discussions on this, so I won’t elaborate. I believe that the biggest causes of transmission are weak bodies (with pathological conditions) and dirty air. These two aspects are interrelated, and the most economical and effective preventive measures are those that everyone is determined to take and has the perseverance to implement, namely physical exercise – morning exercise. Because the chest exercises in morning exercise can directly enlarge your chest cavity, leading to healthy development, and directly enable the internal organs to achieve the same effect. Deep breathing exercises (lung and chest cavity exercises) can directly promote the expansion of lung capacity, and indirectly enlarge the chest cavity. Therefore, people who often perform deep breathing and chest exercises achieve healthy development and maintain health of both the body and internal organs. Furthermore, because we can obtain fresh air every day, washing and cleaning the dirt from our lungs, tuberculosis has no opportunity to thrive. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e68">Democracy—The Bridge to the Shores of Victory <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Du Ai</p>
<p>——In Anticipation of the Establishment of Political Participation Councils in Various Counties and Cities</p>
<p>Democratic politics is enthusiastically supported by modern people because it represents the will of the entire people and is an organization that seeks harmony and happiness. The term "representation," as in the case of the Soviet Union, is not just about reflecting and transmitting ideas; more importantly, it is about faithfully executing the will of the people being represented, seeking their well-being and benefits, and turning people's noble will and reasonable demands into real things that are universally present in reality.</p>
<p>Whether it is art or science, genius or truth, if these things are to be fully developed and to bloom with all their might, it is first necessary to secure the survival and liberation of the nation that guarantees these developments and blooms. The main condition for a nation to gain survival and liberation lies in how to increase and unite the dynamic forces hidden within the entire people, and in how to seek the enthusiastic participation of the people in the political organization. This can only be accomplished through a democratic system. Therefore, it is very clear that genuine democratic politics is the only guardian of all art and science, genius or truth, ideals and desires, happiness and humanity, to ensure that they obtain endless and rational development.</p>
<p>Our current war of resistance is a common cause of the entire people. The need for greater advancement of democratic politics is as clear as the need for constant replenishment and addition of new forces to the war of resistance. The establishment of the National Political Participation Council is precisely to unleash the power of the entire people to help the government achieve the arrival of that glorious, infinitely joyful, eternally victorious final outcome.</p>
<p>The past three sessions of the National Political Participation Council have repeatedly expressed the opinions of the broad masses of people regarding democracy, survival, and liberation; they have repeatedly strived to provide many forces that directly contribute to the war of resistance and national construction to our country's great struggle, allowing the people of the entire country to begin to breathe fresh air and pushing the entire political system towards democratization. This is something that everyone should commend. However, because the National Political Participation Council failed to establish a systematic organization at all levels for a time, it would have been able to exert a greater role. Now, the Political Participation Councils in various counties and cities are accelerating their establishment, and there is news that the Political Participation Councils in various counties and cities in Guangdong are scheduled to be established on April 1st. We hope that the National Political Participation Council, with a systematic organization and a grassroots foundation, will be able to more fully reflect the opinions of the people and further unleash the power of the people's resistance.</p>
<p>The Second National Political Participation Council passed the "Strengthening the Implementation of the Three Principles of the People" resolution. As the Political Participation Councils in various counties and cities are about to be established, we believe that the aforementioned resolution must first be earnestly strengthened and implemented in the Political Participation Councils that practice the Three Principles of the People. Regarding the selection of candidates for political participation in various counties and cities, it should include representatives from various professions, fully adhere to the principles of the United Front, and strive to absorb members from various parties and factions in various counties and cities, leaders from all sectors, and outstanding representatives of non-partisan people's organizations, at the very least in accordance with the organizational composition of the National Government. Only in this way can a broad national foundation be established and the opinions of the people be fully expressed, making the entire National Political Participation Council even more sound and solid, and actively promoting the implementation of the program for resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>Those who act as the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and heart of the people are not just writers. All cultural workers, artists, and soldiers are included. However, precisely because this is a new political construction directly related to the people's welfare and the cause of resistance and national construction, workers in this "cultural" sense should be even more enthusiastic and concerned than others! Therefore, the current cultural workers should not neglect, and should regard as one of the most important tasks, how to promote the establishment of a new political system and make it develop in line with ideals, and should enthusiastically and regularly carry it out.

<h3 id="e69">Brief Discussion on Literary Correspondence <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>There have been many discussions in newspapers about literary correspondence. The proposal of this idea is always desirable, because literary correspondence is not only suitable for the current situation of the war of resistance, but also has its own place in the future peaceful era. Literary correspondence can be said to be a branch of reportage literature. Reportage literature, because it originates from the author's perspective, is inevitably somewhat subjective—at least in the minds of general readers. Literary correspondence can be said to be a two-sided reportage literature. Several writers—regardless of whether they know each other personally—organically report the situations that occur in their respective locations to each other's readers. Even if the writers each write their own subjective views, or even involve some personal trivia, as long as this trivia does not completely deviate from the larger reality, then readers can infer the objective truth of an event from the large and small events described by the correspondents on both sides.</p>
<p>Although the proposal of domestic literary correspondence is a recent event, literary correspondence has long been practiced internationally, since the birth of Esperanto by Bai Chai Huo Pu. The countries that most enthusiastically promoted international literary correspondence in Esperanto should be the Soviet Union. In the past, Shanghai had an Esperanto newspaper called La Mo ds, which introduced things like international literary correspondence. The majority of Soviet Esperanto youth groups often held correspondence with similar groups in various countries, and published good things on bulletin boards or other publications. Even individuals who are learning Esperanto often conduct correspondence with each other. Although this correspondence is not necessarily strictly literary, the academic discussions, reports of local situations, and exchange of personal ideas are still widely regarded as literary correspondence. Although the author personally does not know the current development situation in this regard, I deeply feel that this method is very desirable. If a national language is used to promote domestic literary correspondence, the result must be easier to develop universally than international communication in Esperanto.</p>
<p>We believe that although the development of the literary correspondence movement must initially be encouraged and promoted by newspapers and magazines, and publish more excellent things of this kind, the main goal of those engaged in literary correspondence is still to exchange knowledge and ideas, rather than to publish their correspondence. Personal connections are fostered through shared interests, which objectively amounts to the automatic organization of the masses, which is undoubtedly a great help to China in the current war of resistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the form of literary correspondence, if the purpose is to publish, then of course it will still be in a form similar to reportage literature. But if individual or group correspondence is adopted, and some trivial (but not necessarily purely personal) narratives are added to the content, then this will definitely make the other party readers feel a sense of intimacy, and readers who are third parties will also feel more interested.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Article Cleansing Movement <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Bo</p>
<p>Articles are like a large mirror, which can reflect various aspects of society and all real life, but the degree to which they reflect accurately depends on whether the surface of the mirror is clean or not. If internal and external defects and dust obscure it, it will be difficult to fulfill its greatest responsibilities of reflecting reality and indicating the future. Therefore, launching an article cleansing movement at this time is not an unnecessary thing.</p>
<p>The current articles of various types in Hong Kong are like a not very clean mirror. If you first observe the ordinary people who are engaged in writing in detail, then you can clearly see the following three points: The first is that there are too many people who adhere to formalism. The things they write are like "raising children." If there is a cause, you can definitely guess the result. Whether it is theory or literature, this tendency is unavoidable. The heroes in the articles must be upright and towering figures, and the prisoners must be humble figures who kneel down. Imitation outweighs creation, and the portrayal of typical characters and individual personalities is rarely successful. As a result, it completely turns into an ideal state, far removed from real life, and is finally called "anti-Japanese stereotype." The second type of people stand on a writing position that is not bad, but unfortunately their experience is still insufficient. For example, if his intention is to write about the courageous battles of our army, but because of excessive exaggeration, he writes about them being as tyrannical as × people. Or, if he analyzes the dynamics of the masses in the rear during wartime and makes an introduction, he also incorporates some negative elements into it due to improper propaganda, thus unintentionally doing counter-propaganda for others. And the third type of people seems to be born with a sentimental disposition. They still cannot cure it in the war of resistance. They always pick some sentimental and gray topics and write articles of the type "Thinking, Remembering, Sending, Cherishing, Mourning, Dreaming," which makes others want to be sad for him. Although this type of article is enough to show that we do not forget the old things, what positive meaning does it have besides "showing"? It is useless to others and only wastes one's own emotions. The problems with the above three types of articles lie in adhering to formulas, distorting the theme, and deviating from reality. To do clean work, you should first treat these diseases in each person's article. Each person understands his own article, so this aspect of the article cleansing movement can be carried out automatically by the writers themselves, enriching their creative ability, clarifying the theme, and fully understanding the meaning of the times. Then the article can always reach a clean point, without any flaws and without any toxins!</p>
<p>Regarding cleaning the articles of others, I can also put forward principles and discuss them in two points. One point is to cleanse the articles of pro-peace advocates, in order to cut off the tools of traitors to tempt people's hearts. In institutional publications and pamphlets, they constantly promote pro-peace views that advocate national subjugation and humiliation, praising resistance while secretly planning cunning schemes. And the articles they write are actually also indirect and seemingly well-reasoned. If those who do not know the truth read them, they are very likely to be deceived. Therefore, launching a collective force to severely criticize this kind of absurd propaganda and cleansing the ears of dirty articles is our minimum work. Another point is a large number of obscene tabloids that I am very reluctant to mention but cannot help but mention. These superficial "businessmen" publish tabloids that sell ridiculous "romantic novels" for their own benefit. Although it is a small three-day publication, its sales are often higher than those of major newspapers. Just the fact that dozens of tabloids can survive at the same time shows how many people in Hong Kong are devoted to "obscene newspapers." Moreover, those novels will also be published in single volumes or continued in second and third volumes because of the "large audience." Can you ignore the potential of this subtle influence to "spread poison"? Perhaps it is not as obvious as pro-peace remarks, but people always do not see good virtue as well as lust. Such words are enough to erode ambition and are really terrible. Therefore, using the power of public opinion to criticize this kind of "fragrant and beautiful" article is as necessary as the former. If we can go a step further and implement powerful sanctions against the above-mentioned poisonous articles of "pro-peace" and "obscene," then that is naturally what we expect.</p>

<p>When our ambulance drove through Zhucun for the second time, the situation was even more tragic: rubble, broken wood, and newly created large craters were everywhere, reflected in the dark evening light, seeming to accuse those who came later.</p>
<p>Everyone's mood was very chaotic, and the headquarters would often lose contact with us, making us wander around the enemy's artillery range; but who can you blame for this situation? --Forget it, anyway, the lives of Chinese people are often entrusted to the philosophy of fate.</p>
<p>After we decided to continue forward, we started the engine and drove straight to the front line; however, we were stopped halfway.</p>
<p>"Hey! Ambulance team... brothers! Save... save us!... "</p>
<p>On a highway four miles away from the front line, our trucks were stopped by many wounded soldiers. The ground was full of lying and crouching wounded soldiers. Some of them were severely wounded, and except for intermittent breathing, everything else had been gone. The air was stagnant with a terrifying and empty mood, shrouding the entire blood-red prairie. I still remember clearly: there was a Hakka artilleryman who had part of his arm blown off. He held up the remaining stump, stained dark red with blood and dust, and crouched by the field, still occasionally and unconsciously picking up the pale blood-soaked hand that had been blown off, gazing and gazing again, gazing without sorrow, without pain, without a smile, and without any expression at all.</p>
<p>"Comrade! Why don't you put your injured arm down? Isn't it painful to hold it up?"</p>
<p>"I... I'm afraid... my blood... is flowing... flowing too much... I... I want to live... "</p>
<p>Just like that, my heart, which was trembling for the pitiful and fragile, suddenly became strong, turning into only admiration and emotion, and silently reciting the sentence "I still want to live!"</p>
<p>All kinds of scars, all kinds of thorns pierced my heart. If it weren't for the dangerous place in front, I would definitely stay by their sickbeds for a long time, give them more comfort, and sing more songs about their tragic stories!</p>
<p>There was also another brother who was more seriously injured. He weakly took out a paper packet from his pocket, which contained three one-yuan "Guangdong paper bills," and insisted that we listen to him:</p>
<p>"Brothers! Take it, my salary! I'm--done! I... I can't do it anymore!--Don't let the Japanese devils grab it and buy guns to fight us--Go! I! I...!"</p>
<p>His last soul's cry disturbed my heart. I immediately put down the living wounded soldiers and helped him, until he gradually lost consciousness. I held back a handful of sympathetic and angry tears, and wished infinite blessings for the martyrs.</p>
<p>We carried eight soldiers who had not died, also trembled with the heroic spirits of the sacrificed, promised the soldiers' last entrustment, and started the engine and drove towards the bright path.</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>The light was turned on, by that person who had been hidden behind the coat rack. He then appeared. The maid, upon seeing him, was immediately terrified, like a felled tree trunk. To prevent her commotion, he used his foot to step on her neck, making it difficult for her to breathe: her face flushed red, and saliva flowed from her mouth. The girl, even more frightened by his violence, could not bear the sight of the ruthlessness, the brutality, the innocence, and the guilt. Therefore, gritting her teeth, she asked him:</p>
<p>"Are you also a volunteer army soldier?"</p>
<p>This sarcastic question prompted him to simply answer her:</p>
<p>"No, I am a bandit!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps also an experienced bandit, otherwise, so skilled, so violent!"</p>
<p>She thought, and therefore, she restored her original good feelings towards the volunteer army, while her hatred for bandits deepened.</p>
<p>He turned off the electric light again, hoping to leave calmly in the darkness.</p>
<p>The bedroom was still in darkness, as silent as if there was no one there. Now was the time for him to take her away.</p>
<p>However, due to his composure and her submission, it aroused in him a kind of inexplicable sympathy that violated his own actions, so he quietly asked her:</p>
<p>"Can you forgive me?" (Sixteen)</p>
