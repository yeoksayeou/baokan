<h3 id="c1">戰時報業之質的變化 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 范長江</p>
<p>（一）政治資本代商業資本</p>
<p>抗戰第二期的新聞工作，和第一期有什麼異同呢？我們可從許多方面，斷定二期抗戰的報業，和一期比較，不但在量的增減有變化，卽在質的方面，亦有很顯著的變遷，可以說與抗戰一期固不同，和抗戰勝利後亦不同。這個時期裏面，×雖勢成弩末，然將竭其全力以圖一逞，當殘×迥光返照的時候，若千內地都市，可能的遭其騷擾，建立在商業上的報紙，即靠廣吿發行以資維持之報紙，勢將被迫動搖而漸趨消沉。除滬港兩個特區外，商業性的報紙雖立足，廣告和發行的收入激減了，報紙和油墨的來源困難了，發行網和讀者羣一天天的縮小了，於是地方政府與駐紮軍部，爲滿足軍民的精神食粮，不得不各於所在地，出版小型的甚至石印的油印的報紙，報業的政治資本，遂代商業資本而興。故我們預測卽將到來的報業，工作固很艱困，形式亦很特殊。</p>
<p>（二）人的基礎代物的基礎</p>
<p>打了整整二十個月的仗，我國一般的報業，依然是建築在物的基礎上面，報業最主要的厥爲物力（包括財力在內）。我們有錢就能請編輯雇工友辦報紙，此外沒有什麼困難。戰局轉入二期的後半階段，物的基礎就靠不住了，一方面則商業資本毀滅，沒有多餘的財力可以如心所欲，另一方面則報紙必要的材料，痛感無處可以採辦，有錢亦無辦法。報業喪失物的基礎會妨害其存在的價値麼？不，絕不如此，報業反而表現一副新姿態，跨進一個新時期，人的活動接替物的基礎，人的技能彌補了物的缺憾，以後只要有人，就會有報，物的豐嗇，無關宏旨。有了一架收音機和一具油印器，就可出版精彩百出的報紙，此時的報紙是流動性的，以人爲主體的，靠人的精神以補救物質的不足的。</p>
<p>（三）團結本位代地域本位</p>
<p>報業建築在人的基礎後，全國各地，均將出現新型報紙，它的銷路雖不廣，經濟雖不佳，但分布的狀態則極爲均勻和深入，一反從前偏枯的老毛病，調劑了膨脹和貧血的壞現象。這一時期最濃厚的色彩，即係人的活動，需要幾萬的新聞從業員去開闢這個特殊的新天地，以前富於地域本位的新聞組合，將爲大時代的狂流所冲刷而改道，此後亟需新的幹部，以新幹部爲核心，再團結着外圍的份子，由外圍份子復吸收對報業有熱誠的男女靑年，把全國新聞從業員構成一個有機體，調節盈虛，溝通有無，根合理而適切的分配於全國的各地，不管×後×前以及後方前線。新聞從業員當前的課題，第一是團結，第二是團結，第三仍是團結，唯以團結爲本位，始能突破當前難關，達成堅苦使命，有裨抗戰建國。</p>
<h3 id="c2">世界動向一週間 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>自廿八年四月廿三日至廿九日</p>
<p>四月份的最後一週，可說是暴風雨前的可怕的沉靜時期。</p>
<p>在歐洲，兩條陣綫的鬥爭，已由箭拔弩張的正面衝突，側重於各自的外交活動，其中德意之誘致南保等國，英法之鞏固巴爾幹，英羅兩國之談判，蘇聯之擴大反侵略陣線運動，最爲引人注目。而以希特勒廿八日的談話告一結京。同時，在外交鬥爭中，彼此的戰備工作，是更加緊張了。</p>
<p>在遠東，我們主動優勢的抗日戰爭，續有重大的進步，同時反侵略陣線擴展到遠東來的聲浪，也震動了大平洋兩岸，因此，日本侵略者更戚狼狽了。雖然這一週內還沒有重要的活動，但是軍事上尤其是政治上的新的陰謀，已在積極計劃以至推動了。</p>
<p>英法急抱佛腳</p>
<p>在法西斯侵略者的加緊威脅與進攻之下，英法資本家政府採取了「臨急抱佛脚」的政策，一面極力拉攏蘇聯，一面極力宣傳備戰，同時極力保持外圍的小國？</p>
<p>這一週，英法兩國繼續執行上述政策。第一，關於對蘇外交的，英法兩國曾於上週邀請蘇聯支撑東歐和平，當時蘇聯卽曾提出具體建議，（見上星期日『一週間』）英法兩國當即進行會商，據仕二日路透社倫敦電稱，英法正在審查，卽可成立折衷方案，廿二日蘇駐英大使邁斯基返莫斯科，亦有重大會談，邁氏於廿三日卽離蘇返英。一般人均相信英蘇談判甚爲順利，大約英法兩國將各個與蘇聯締結新協定。第二，關於對各小國的，英政府首先企圖在巴爾幹造成一個中立集團（包括保加利亞）俾各國互相協助，安定地中海東方。其次是安定波蘭和羅馬尼亞。廿三日倫敦「星期泰晤士報」載稱波羅兩國態度巳趨明朗，决定將共同防蘇協定修訂，以迎合時代潮流。廿四日，英羅兩國談話在倫敦舉行，以擴大波羅聯繫爲主題，據英方公佈，英羅會談已於廿六日結束，成績異常圓滿。不過事實上英國是否能從德意魔手中奪囘這些衛星國家，全視英國反侵略的决心與實力而定，因此我們看第三，英國政府又於廿六日匆遽宣佈實施徵兵制，同日正式通知德　兩國，表示反對侵略的堅决態度。法國內閣亦曾於廿一日晚　過　要屬防案，請人民繼績犧牲，英法此種武裝保衛民主和平的表示，誠可振奮人心。</p>
<p>美蘇重要表示</p>
<p>美國反法西斯反侵略的態度，就表現的較爲澈底與明朗，第一，他對英法蘇進行合作談判一節，表示十分贊同，（廿三日中央社華盛頓電）第二，修正中立法工作，巳有這大進展，多數議員主張援助英法，並向日本實施經濟壓力，（什四日華盛頓電）第三，美總統羅斯福於廿五日向國會提出創設新機構的法案，他說：「在此目無法紀冀圖推毀民主政府之秋，竟有厚顏無恥者流，相信民主國家機構因維持民主化而日形軟弱，是以冀圖輕舉妄動。此次之改組政府機構，亦卽爲答覆他們的挑戰！」第四，美國積極準備反抗侵略的軍事工作，推進偉大的陸海空增軍計劃。此外還計劃於數月內動員一百二十萬人參加戰時工作。又奉命調返太平洋的大艦隊，巳於廿七日通過巴傘馬運河。第五，美蘇關係日有進步，空軍合作談判尙稱順利，又蘇聯不着陸飛行，亦於廿八日出發赴美。</p>
<p>蘇聯全國，從黨，政府，此至廣大民衆，過去，現在，今後，都是民主和平陣綫上最忠實的一員，是反侵略陣綫上最英勇的先鋒。最近在事實上表現的，第一，他向英法鄭重建議，建立廣大的集體安全制度，以互助公約，保證彼此領土完整，其範圍並應包括遠東在內。（見廿二日法國外交部喉舌的「晨報」）蘇聯外委長李維諾夫，也主張由英法蘇三國參謀本部商識援助被侵略國的具體辦法。並表示三國參謀部如能確定各國分担的責任、蘇聯卽可準備援助羅、波及任何英法集團中的各國。（廿二日美聯社倫敦電）第二、蘇聯對於組織集體安全制度，近來尤爲努力。外交副委長波丹金，歷訪巴爾幹各國。廿六日又向正爲意國煽動中的保加利亞進行協商。廿八日抵土京，與土耳其當局商談黑海防衛問題。波氏並將赴羅馬尼亞等國進行會談。第三，蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基以英蘇合　　　　　，廿三日卽離蘇返英，廿七日往巴黎，先巳與羅馬尼亞外長加芬科會商援羅。並將進與法國有所談商。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國這種行動，對於反侵略運動，自然是大有助益的。</p>
<p>德意極力掙扎</p>
<p>德意侵略者對於民主和平各國的反抗，自然還有其對策的。何况在民主和平陣綫中，英法兩國政府，在聲色俱厲表示不再退讓之中，仍舊秘密打開後門，暗示尙可商議呢！（主要的事實是因德國併吞捷克而一度召囘的英法駐德大使，現已先後返　復任。英大使韓德森還曾於廿五日會見德外長，表示德國將來再有侵略行爲，則英始加以抵抗。）因此德意侵略者還可以繼續其侵略計劃。第一是向英法集團國淮行威脅與騙誘政策。對保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，波蘭等國，極力拉攏。以恢復保國失地爲餌，誘保加入防共集團；以德羅經濟協定，勸羅不加入反侵略的陣綫；意國則更假手匈牙利以拉攏南國。德國還積極準備與彼蘭進行直接談判，（惟波蘭已表示拒絕）。此外對土耳其的活動，對北歐各國之詢問是否感受德國威脅等等，都在企圖打擊反侵陣綫，减低羅斯福建議的價値。第二、是加强侵略集團的團結，首先是意大利之力使南匈兩國諒解；其次是匈總理外長之定期廿八日訪德。用意都在密切德意兩國的合作。此外美聯社廿五日巴黎電，還稱：最近日本擬以太平洋上一部份委任統治島嶼交還德國，俾德日兩國，可以此爲海軍根據地；這種計劃，不僅爲加强使略國的團結，而且是在準備從東西兩方向民主和平的英法等國進行夾攻了！第三，希特勒於廿八日發表長篇演詞，伸述五點；「（一）德並未破壞和平，羅斯福無權對德貴難；（二）廿年來德未參加過世界任何戰事，國社黨執政後曾迭有裁軍要求，可見德實愛和平；（三）德向羅斯福電中所提各國詢問，均答並無受德威脅之事（四）德政府今後不再派代表參加任何形似法威之會議；（五）德認英德海軍協定及德波條約均曾失效。」他這篇曲盡文過飾非操縱抑揚之妙的演說，首先拒絕了美國的和平建議進而宣佈英德海約德波協定，民主和平各國至此應該收拾善勸的幻想，進取更堅强的反侵略陣綫，以實力來爭取集體安全制度的成立了！</p>
<p>日×慌亂失措</p>
<p>在中國愈戰愈奮愈戰愈强的抵抗之下，日本侵略者原已在發抖了！怎禁得再加上國際上反侵略陣線的積極進展！因此，日本侵略者就不能不表現其黨慌失措了。第一，是反侵略陣線擴至遠東的消息傳出以後，日本當局卽焦躁不安起來，廿二日東京「國民新聞」、「都新聞」等。都以無賴罵與恫嚇的論調，攻擊民主和平各國，尤其是攻擊英國，『都新聞』甚至代表軍部宣稱：『英國一面援華一面親蘇之所爲，使英日關係愈益緊張，巳達到英日有對戰可能的程度』。接着日軍在華佔領地區的排外運動，尤其是反英運動更加猖狂起來。第二，日本五相於廿三日晚集議對歐局態度，雖無具體决定，但已一致痛感日本在國際上將愈陷孤立，而對於美維之返防太平洋，尤覺所予日本威脅的嚴重。廿四日東京『報知新聞』還說這是：『美國對日本的挑釁行爲』。第三，是日本人民之反對防共集團，與日本政府內部的紛岐情形愈加嚴重，誠如廿七日倫教泰晤士報刊載東京訪員的報吿所說：『日本全國人民，凡屬非軍人，一致反對與德意締結軍事同盟。日本內閣多數閣員，亦持此主張』。</p>
<p>我們由此可以看出日本今日在國際樹敵之衆，與其所處環境的險惡；我們由此更可看出日本內部紛歧情形的嚴重，和對於侵略前途的渺茫失望。這是我們堅持團結堅持抗戰的第一個成果，也是我們反對汪精衛等「反共和平」活動的第一個成果。</p>
<p>當然日本侵略者還有新的陰謀，這種陰謀大致可分爲三點；第一，對德意侵略者，在軍閥專制之下，只有加繁團結，雖然希特勒廿八日的演詞中沒有有提到遠東，但是事實上他們是將分從東西兩方進迫非侵略國家的，廿五日委聯社巴黎電所稱德日勾結在太平洋建海軍根據地，可算是一個顯例。第二，日×對英法，則進一步的實行恫嚇與誘惑，以挫折英法聯穌援華的政策，進而要挾英法調停中日戰事，壓迫中國屈服。這種可能性雖因中國抗戰力量的增强而已趨減少，但確爲日×不變的策略。至於對美，則力避衝突，以免軍火及原料來源的斷絕，對蘇則作事實上的屈服，以免吃眼前虧。第三對中國，則將加緊利用汪精衛等的「反共和平」運動，以　撥離間我政府與民衆及國共兩黨的合作，以破壞抗戰建國事業，以配合『鞏固佔領區建立僞中央』的計劃，準備發動軍事的新進攻。</p>
<p>抗戰一週形勢</p>
<p>前面已經略述日本侵略者最近的對華計劃。至於軍事方面，主要目的還在打通平漢與粵漠兩路，鞏固兩路以東地區的佔領。目前一面在浙閩粵沿海一帶加緊騷動，溫州，福建，汕頭各地形勢仍極緊張；一面向湘北蠢動，企圖進奪長沙，控制　漢路。所有這些動作，都是上述作戰目的的事實表現。此外西北方面，已遭挫敗，暫時尙無取採攻勢可能，西南方面雖仍在四處騷亂，尤其是對四邑的威脅，但亦無積極移作主要戰場的企圖。至於廿八日北平電傳日方代言人謂有新兵二萬五千人續增華北參戰，目的殆在應付我們的×後戰鬥。</p>
<p>我們爲着打破×人這種軍事計劃，加重×軍的困難，制止×軍的進攻。提高我軍的士氣，曾於兩星期前開始各戰場的反攻，這次反攻進行相當順手，華北華中華南各地，都有重大的勝利，不僅在漢奸汪精術等的猖狂活動之中，大大振作了民衆的抗戰情緒，而且大大提高了我軍的戰鬥力，大大提高了我國在國際上的地位。我們×人的軍事計劃特別是新的進攻計劃，巳遭受到嚴重的打擊而頓挫下來了。</p>
<p>最近一週，我們仍舊保持主動的優勝地位，各戰場的反攻且有新的進展。特別重要的是我軍一再反攻，衝入南昌，廿七日午後我軍第三次衝入南昌，展開激烈巷戰。同時我後續部隊亦抵市郊，內外相匯，園殲鉅×。此次勝利，一面足以打破×人和漢奸汪精衛等，『日軍未有挫折，依然所向無敵』的宣傳，一面阻止了×軍對湘北的攻勢，在政治上軍事上都有重大的意義。而我軍的英勇善戰，我軍戰鬥力的提高，更加深世界人士的認識，此外我軍在華北則威脅北平濟南等城；在隴海綫則於二十日再度攻入開封，廿二日以來包圍徐州；在東戰塲則於仕七日一度攻入杭州城，與×軍巷戰數小時；在華南則繼續威脅廣州四郊。其餘如在晉東南我軍，最近殲×逾萬（廿八日中央社潼關電），我空軍亦大顯神威，連日在各戰場上活躍，予×以重大創傷，和從前之只由我方受炸，却巳經完全不同了。</p>
<p>目前我在未來戰局重心的湘北，已有嚴密的佈置。蔣委長决定自兼華中區最高指揮官，親自指導第×第×第×各戰區大軍，阻止×軍進攻。湘省某地，且已佈置行轅。湘鄂贛一帶陣地佈置三月，現亦全部完成。衡陽長沙株州一帶工事尤爲堅固。其次浙閩粵沿海，亦巳有重要部署。（一）蘇浙贛皖閩邊，新四軍的戰鬥力正在日益壯大。（二）閩省過去抗戰準備，外間頗多流言，但最近第×戰區長官顧祝同與西南行營主任白崇禧兩將軍親赴福州以後，雖然『帶來了×機的轟炸』，却巳一掃『太平氣象』，趕緊準備抗×，也許還能悻免危岌。此外潮汕方面，形勢頗爲緊急，雖賴華振中將軍悉力領導，準備抗戰。但尙盼政府注力於該方面前綫戰鬥力的充實，政治機構的改革；動員工作的發展。潮汕是華南和東南抗戰的重要據點。也是目前西自渝桂湘韶東出海口的樞要，我們要盡力保衛他！</p>
<p>請參閱附圖（排在第三版）</p>
<p>中國前途如何</p>
<p>無論從國內國際和抗戰形勢着眼，中國前途是光明的！尤其是蔣委員長在上週發表談話，公佈汪精衛和半陰謀爲通×賣國，公佈汪精衛輩業已在精神上判處死刑以後，『中國前途光明』，巳爲每個中國人與國際輿論的一種常識了。</p>
<p>蘇聯各報首先揭載蔣委員長這次談話全文，表示極大滿意，並認爲中國最高領袖决心抗戰到底，亦卽中國全體人民的决心表示。蘇聯全國同情援助中國的運動，更加熱烈地展開了。</p>
<p>英國輿論也一致盛贊我英勇抗戰，廿二日英倫孟哲斯德衛報還　論，盛稱：「明慧及眼光遠大的觀察者，皆認對於世界靑年具有重大影響之一種新的有力的文化，現正在遠東開展中，此種新文化之來源，卽蘇俄積極發展其遠東屬土如西伯利亞。及中國政府決定開發西部各省」。該報又說「中國獨力抗戰，毫無敗徵，中國對於愛好和平國家之貢獻，其偉大處不讓英國之裁軍或羅斯福總統之和平建議」。</p>
<p>我們在政治上，有蔣委員長廿五日對大公報記者談話中所表示的關於改革下層行政機構及確立民主政治基礎的計劃。在經濟上，有蔣委員長廿二日對地政學會訓詞中强調戰時實行民生主義之土地政策的重要。在外交上，有蔣委員長與蔣夫人廿四日電賀太平洋西北會議之促請禁運軍火赴日，有郭泰祺大使在歐呼籲列强擴大反侵略陣綫到遠東。在西部建設上，有西康屯墾計劃之積極推進及邊民之熱烈贊助建設新西康等。在軍事上，則建設新空車運動已有更重大的進展，並有大量購買飛機材料的消息，所有這些本週的消息，巳足令人興奮舞鼓了。</p>
<p>但是，我們這種進步與努力，顯然還遠趕不上客觀形勢的需要。無論在政治上經濟上外交上前綫軍事上和後方建設上，都還沒有達到結束抗戰的過度時期，克服相持階段的困難，以準備推進總反攻的必要的程度；相反的，×人漢奸挑撥雖間造謠誣陷等陰謀，尤其是『反共』『和平』的活動，却正在用種種令人防不勝防的方法在推進着！最近一週內國民參政會的延長休會期間，和各省參議員名單中之未盡能充分表現民主精神與各黨合作，這些消息，旣與最高領袖的意旨和中央的國策有所出入，更將給×奸以造謠的機會！我們希望政府加以迅速適當的補救，司時民衆主活必要程度的改善和戰時民主精神的發楊，都是目前克服困難爭取勝利的先决條件，必須由决議案宣言文及綱領等等而成事實，才能收到全民動員保障勝利的實效，才能不負世界各國對我的厚望！</p>

<p>— 繼昌</p>
<p>【民革社晉西通訊】去年十豐月下旬在×人再行進攻晋西北，並將寧武神池及　縣屬之軒嶺佔領之後，山西二區各機關團體合組的前綫慰勞巡視團，在戰局極度緊張的情况下，從苛嵐出發，走上了他們的征途，在晉西北的冰天雪地中，他們徒步跋涉了千餘里的路程，走到了眞正的國防最前綫，花費了五十餘日的工夫，滿載着寳貴的收穫和勝利的成績而重新回到了苛嵐，重新囘到了苛嵐，這在他們完全是出乎意料之外的，</p>
<p>慰勞巡視團一行十六人，爲了在必要的時候可以游擊作戰，他們自己配備着武噐出發時的苛嵐是處在不斷的警報威脅中城裏的居民，大半巳經完成了『淸舍』的工作，在奔赴前綫的路上他們只看見退下來的居民和某些隊的家眷，却不見回路上去的人們，前綫的消息。有時是離奇可怕的，但是他們爲了完成神聖的任務，仍然是往前奔馳。因爲前方的隊伍，大半在山上駐紮、所以他們必須走山間小路。在蓋滿了雪的山路上，他們攀登跳越，顚波地前進，有時走在厚雪中，只露出上半個身子；有時因爲找不到路徑在下山時，便用皮衣包頭，一滑而下，有一天他們從早到晚，只走了三十里，可以想見路途的難走了。可是就在這些『高高的山崗上』，正是我們游擊隊的出沒　。</p>
<p>慰勞巡視團的足跡，踏過了六個縣份的境界，慰勞過二十幾個單位的部隊。他們慰勞工作的方式是：（一）與全體戰士談話，（二）開軍政全部聯歡會，（三）歌唱游藝，四献國旗，當他們和戰士們談話的時候，戰士莫不鼓舞感激，高呼口號。在軍政全部聯歡會上，各級全部能够提出好些有意義的問題和寳貴的建議。譬如游擊某　的時候，正値雙「一二」紀念日，於是他們便討論雙「一二」事變的意義，雖然最初意見稍有不同，但經過討論之後，一致認爲雙「一二」事變在客觀上决定了國內的團結，奠定了統一戰線的基礎。</p>

<p>— 張常人筆記</p>
<p>在長沙時，卽聞湘北我軍第×師兵王書　深入×陣，盜取大批×方軍郵歸來之訊，因於四月二日由長出發湘北陣中視察，途中樣詞該士兵所屬部隊之駐在地，擬作一度訪談。及抵汨羅，始知該部隊正警備新墻河兩岸第一綫陣地。四月十日，行抵新墻河附近該師師部，彼適又奉命出發岳陽偵察×情。交臂失之。十六日始在汨羅江南之×××見之，蓋又已完成任務，並獲得×方文件書籍等安然歸來矣。</p>
<p>王君容貌淸秀，身材適中，衣黑色短衫褲，恂恂答記者所問各切，條理分明，且甚謙抑，然進退舉措，一望而知曾受過軍人敎養有年。彼於報吿完畢後，猶深以報國有心，學養不足爲憾。旅中適携有『日本的間諜』一書，因持贈之，期或能稍增閒諜常識。</p>
<p>據第×師參謀主任爲言：王君頗具胆識，且企圖心甚大。每次出勤，必於原定任務外，以獵獲其他爲快。當彼發覺其間諜細胞有反間諜行動時，必力除之，固一天才間諜也。　——常人附記</p>
<p>我名叫王書　；岳陽×××人。今年二寸三歲，父親已經去世，母親巳六十多歲，和兄嫂們仍在×××耕作度日，勉强可以溫飽。</p>
<p>十四歲時我在鄉裏的小學校畢業，投入岳陽縣政府保安隊當勤務兵。一年以後，就正式當了保安隊員。十七歲時，覺得當保安隊的前途有限，就由朋友介紹，到南京入警備司令部機關槍營民國二十六年十二月，這機關槍營改由陸軍第五十一師指揮，十二月十三日，在首都南鬥外雨花台附近作戰受傷，先後在湖北黃岡和武昌的傷兵醫院醫治。去年一月底回到岳陽家裏養傷。到三月裏就全愈了。我看國家到了這步田地，年輕人做事，沒有比當兵更好的了，所以又加入岳陽的常備隊。去年十一月裏，第×師在新墻一帶作戰，因爲我是當地人，就被錄用，任下士便衣隊員。</p>
<p>五個月來，我和便衣隊的同志們時常出入岳陽一帶×人的後方，偵察×情，先後被捕過四次，都給我脫逃了。我盜取×人的軍郵這囘事，就是在我第一次被捕後撞到的一個機會。</p>
<p>那是在一月九日，我奉命由袁紹忠村附近的游擊營出發，赴岳陽以　三四十里地的雲溪車站附近偵察。到平地李家化裝了一個農夫，挑了一担紅薯向北進入×人的警戒綫。事先我獲得了一塊所謂「良民證」的布條。（的四寸長，二寸半寬。上面橫書「身元證明」，下面分塡「姓名」，「住所」，「職業」，「年齡」各項，下署『×××自治委員會」，除該會鈴記外，布角上有「內藤」圓形小印一顆。）×人因爲要引誘人民囘鄉，所以看到這塊布條就讓我通　。在×我兩軍的第一綫之間，有十多里的地方，老百姓仍舊在耕種。×人的一般工事，和我們的並沒有多大差別，不過據點工事大都用鋼骨水泥構築的，外面還有兩三道織絲網，一定得用大砲才能把它轟坍；掩蔽得很好，就是在近處，有時很發也難覺。</p>
<p>我到了雲溪車站，就給十幾個×子兵圍住了。他們起先隨意拿我的紅薯吃。最後來了一個憲兵，勸我當僞軍，並用槍逼着我走，雲溪的市街接近火車站，走不多遠，就折進一家市房裏去。這房子四週也圍着鐵絲網。我一邊走進去，一邊就留心書出路。那是一並排三間的屋子。他把我准進中間的一間，並且把門反鎖起來。</p>
<p>屋子裏巳經有五六個二三十歲的種田人，大家又氣又怕的坐在乾草上，他們雖不認識我，却也爲我的不幸表示同情，看那憲格子，並不怎樣結實、我想，要逃也許只有這條路。</p>
<p>我進去　是下午三點多鐘，五點鐘打過，另一個憲兵忽然把門打開了，呼斥我出去。他用手表示要我爲他們打掃房屋。我欣然拿起箕帶。左手的一間房門上掛着「大日本鄱便局」的牌子，探頭向窗子裏看去，當窗的狹長的桌子上堆滿了許多信和紙捲子。猜定它是軍郵局。右手的一間是灶屋着我一眼瞥見刀砧上擺。亮閃閃一把菜刀，七八寸長，二寸來寬，倒有些像屠刀。我把地掃好趁×子兵不備，就拿了藏進上衣裏面，然後依舊讓他把我倒鎖在當中的一間房于裏，給了我一小筒子機米飯，上面有一小塊挺腥的鹹魚。</p>
<p>我默默地把刀藏在草裏，連同屋子的人都沒有知道，接着，我坐近墻，眼望看窗外漸漸地暗沉下來的天色，聽着×子兵的皮鞋和馬蹄的聲音，一面反背着手，用刀把地上挖了一個小小的坑，把刀埋在裏面，天黑了，同屋的人都昏地倒在草上睡着了，聽聰外面，走路的人也减少了，我就在黑暗裏抽出那把刀，開始慢慢的削斷那窗格子，費了兩個多鐘點，才取下了三根，足容一個人鑽出去。</p>
<p>大約是十一點鐘，×××××好大的鼾聲。我就跳出窗口，同時，决心要盜取了軍郵之後再逃走。足走到「郵便局」的窗前，推了推，裏面扣着，用刀去，也不動。桌子上的兩大包郵件，在暗淡的夜色中引誘着我，先輕輕的把玻璃打碎，然後伸手進去打開窗子，才一手挾住一包，却不知道因爲一時心慌呢，還是郵狹長的桌子沒有擺穩，「轟隆一地翻了過去。這樣，我就只有「三十六着，走爲上着」了，我立即大步竄出屋子跨過鐵絲網的短鬥，飛躍地向西南方面的黑暗中狂奔。×人的憲兵跟蹤的追了出來，槍聲一響，躲在工事裏的×人，也像所調「一犬吠影，百犬吠聲一的盲目地向黑暗中開槍了。跑了三四里，×人的槍彈仍是呼呼地在我頭上飛過。這時覺得携帶的東西太重——每包郵件約有八九斤重——定不快，决意忍痛捨棄一包，這樣再走了六七里，綿密的槍聲才遠落在後面。</p>
<p>於是我在小山上的小松林裏休息了一囘，然後慢慢地提着那包郵件歸來。</p>
<p>黎明，要穿過×人在岳陽以南新建的汽車路，看見在半里路外，有六七個哨兵在向我這邊走來，我若無其事的穿過了。等到他們發現我，高聲叫我站住時，我巳經穿進路邊的山林，他們追了一陣，終究沒有敢追進樹林裏來。</p>
<p>兩天之後，囘到師部，呈献了我的戰利品，並且詳細報吿了經通情形。那一包郵件是用日本蒲包裹着的，裏面一共有四百多封信，幾十捲報紙和雜誌。立刻就轉呈到上級的軍部裏去。後來我知道這裏面有許多材料給我們做參攷，×軍士兵的厭戰也有了更新鮮的證明。其中還有一份×軍人見部隊在南宿州和我們作戰受傷者的名單，一大隊中（記者按：日軍一大隊由四個連組成，每連二百十餘人。共有輕重機關槍七十餘挺，火力較我一團旺盛。）負傷者達一百五十人，陴亡者尙不在內。漢好辦的「武漢報」也初次看見了。</p>
<p>師長當時就獎賞了我二十元。沒有幾天，軍部和軍團部也先後各賞了一百元獎金。又把我從下士升做上士。我眞非常感激。不過對於賞金和升級，並不是我所以要工作的目的，我只恨讀書太少，對於國家沒有更多的帮助。</p>
<p>我到岳陽時，常遇見律田聯隊長，獨自騎一頭軍馬懷了一枝手槍，到他所强佔的我們的女同胞家裏去，我眞想設法帶一技槍去結果了他。但爲了更大的目的的我還沒有奉到叫我這麼辦的命令。（四二七，在汨羅兩岸。）</p>

<p>【路透社柏林廿八日電】德國駐英國及波蘭代辦、今日分別向英、波政府遞呈備忘錄、廢除英、德海軍協定及德波修約、致英之備忘錄內、追述張伯倫當日由慕尼黑携返之英、德元首共同聲言、卽「張伯倫與希特勒均視該協定爲德、英兩國期望永不構釁之表示」、牒文內附加說明、德國認爲最近英國對於德國調和政策巳愈離愈遠、殊以爲憾、英德海軍協定雖予以廢止、但德國盼望此舉不致影響海軍質的定則、藉以避免各國無限制之競築新艦、廢止德波條約之牒文中稱、波蘭此次與英成立協定、顯然與數月前簽訂德、波條約時之嚴正宣言的立場大相理庭、德政府對波蘭政策之驟變、惟有感覺驚異、英波協定乃爲直接反對德國之行動、亦卽直接反對一九三四年之宣言、即相互同意反對武力之引用、波蘭業巳表明甘願捨棄德政府所予之和平保證、而接受第三國援助的諾言、實卽附和句圍德國之政策、事實上波蘭已無形中廢止一九三四年之宣言、但德國雅不願因是而將德、波修好之初衷拋棄、波蘭如不忘舊好、則德國仍欲就彼此提供明確信約之下、與波蘭另訂新約云、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦廿九日電】希特勒發表演說後、英國已加緊國防準備、作為對希特勒之答覆、英國各地軍部均有甚多男子自動入伍、前外長文登亦應徵參加、希特勒宣佈廢棄英、德海軍協約、此間認為一種政治上之盧張聲勢、但對希特勒之廢除德、波協約、認為嚴重之舉動、預料德國將侵犯波蘭利益、而激起英、法實行援波之保證、又此間外交界意見、希特勒宣佈廢止德、波協約、將迫使波蘭重新改訂外交政策、而與蘇聯密切合作、</p>
<p>【路透社柏林廿八日電】此間各報雖熱烈歡抑希特勒之演詞、但外國政界則均坦白表示悲觀、某外交家告路透社記者日、現時問題已非有無發生戰爭之可能、而係戰爭將在何時發生、一般解釋希特勒之演詞、認爲希特勒雖明知歐洲之命運實繫於其如何解决但澤問題、然仍决心遵循自選之途徑以解决之、多數人現正將希特勒反波之手段比擬其滅捷之方法、兩者若屬平行、則相信其第二步工作、將向波蘭提出更爲廣泛及有力之要求云、</p>
<p>【路透社華沙廿九日電】此間官方對希特勒宣佈廢棄德波條約、尙未加以批評、但希特勒之廢棄該約、原屬意中之事、故不足爲奇、據此間表示、波蘭之國策乃建基於自身之力量、而非仰賴於條約之保障、政府機關報『波蘭捷報』聲言、但澤務須保持其現狀、　波蘭决不容別個民族侵奪其在但澤之權利及統治權、該報謂、「唯一可以修正之點、厥爲撤消國聯之權力」、意卽波蘭準備與德共同設立彼、德共管機關、以代現行國聯之支配、</p>
<p>【路透社柏林廿八日電】希特勒之演說、除德國會議員八百八十人外、且藉廣播機而達於世界各地無數聽衆、希特勒對羅斯福總統建議之答覆、早在一般意料之中、而未引起驚異、蓋任何人皆預料希特勒决不能接受羅總統建議、而將解釋其拒絕之理由也、一般觀察、繼希特勒演說之後、德國各報、將展開對波蘭之猛烈攻擊、過去數日間、各報再度刊載『德人在波被虐待』之消息、政界解釋希特勒之所謂在何一國如需要德國予以保證者、德國均願給予之語、絕對不能認為係接納羅斯福總統之建議、此項保證、僅涉及德國與受保證之國、故遇有毀約情事發生時、亦與第三國無涉云、</p>
<p>【中央社但澤自由市廿八日電】希特勒本日所發表之演說中、有一段涉及但澤市、國社黨人士咸皆預料、本市將於五月一日併入德國、此間警察已暫時取消假期、國社黨黨軍挺進隊、亦已奉令前來、</p>
<p>【中央社立陶宛京城廿九日電】據立陶宛方面觀察、當前局勢並未因希特勒之演說而稍見和緩、因德波緊張局勢、或有使東歐捲入漩渦之虞云、</p>
<p>【中央社柏林廿九日電】希特勒昨日演說、前後歷兩小時半、發音極慢、並隨時佐之以各種姿態、其主要之兩點、爲擊英國及廢棄德、波條約、希特勒朗讀羅斯福總統電文所列卅餘國國名時、全場哄堂大笑、述及巴力斯坦時、議場但聞一片什笑聲、達半分鐘之久、</p>
<p>【美聯社華沙廿九日電】官方宣稱、拒絕任何單方面、企圖以壓力而解决波德題題之方法，但希特勒演詞及德國照會中所提及之各點、波蘭當極端重視、並認爲乃善意之表示、波方雖力謂廢棄波、德互不侵犯協定者、乃德國而非波蘭、惟消息靈通方面認爲、雙方繼續談判之可能未盡消失、</p>
<p>【路透社華沙廿九日電】此間「華沙日報」本日宣稱、「德國對但　及在波蘭走廊築路之提議、波蘭將永不同意、該報幷稱、波蘭幷未收到有關廿五年不侵犯協定及保證斯拉伐克之提議、</p>
<p>【中央社柏林廿八日電】希特勒演詞、頃由富有經驗之觀察家加以評論、咸謂、波蘭巳與一九三八年之捷克處于同一境地、行將爲德國東進政策之犧牲者、但希特勒將俟五月一日全國勞動節慶祝典禮完畢之後、前往許德斯拉登鎭別墅休憇、里賓特羅甫外長亦將于下月中前往匈國報聘、德對于波蘭未必主卽有所舉動、可以見矣、至以德國所擬計劃而論、大抵當從宣傳入手、用以煽動波境內各少數民族、此與曩日對付捷克之所爲初無二致、同時幷當在東南歐洲、尤其是羅國、努力外交活動、以陷波蘭于孤立之境、此種計劃、需時甚久、較之以前對付捷克國者、困難尤多、此則德政界人士亦所承認者、各觀察家幷謂、德國對於烏克蘭地方覬覦巳久、近頃曾向波蘭國提議、會同加以侵略、但波國因恐本身淪爲德國附庸庸、乃拒不予以接受云、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦廿八日電】張伯倫於離此往度週末例假以前、與哈立法克期外相晤談達四十五分鐘、據悉、二人曾討論希勒特之演詞及廢棄英、德海軍協定、</p>
<h3 id="c16">希特勒演說　各國反響　英法並不引為驚異　巴爾幹國家將會議 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>英</p>
<p>【路透社倫教什八日電】倫敦方面現正縝密研究希特勒之演詞、官方在未詳細研究明白之前、暫時不願發表意見、關於廢棄海軍協定一節、此間認爲旣無交換情報之舉、則雖維持比例定則、亦無多大價值、從法律上之觀點言、片面的宣布廢約原屬無效、德方牒文內關於宣佈廢棄海軍協定表示、當時締結協定係以英國不千涉德國在歐洲之政策爲原則、此種觀念、完全錯誤、蓋談判經過、從未涉及此事、英方極力否認英國報界有被鼓勵採取反德態度之事實、英國更無對德國將來在歐洲之一切問題均加以反對之必要、英國之行動、絕對非以反德爲始基、而係决心反對侵略所致、一般人以爲德國應于廢棄協定前邀請英國共同討論、而不應遽爾作片面之行動、聞英方巳準備於適當時期答覆德國、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦廿九日電】據路透社海軍訪員稱、希特勒之决意廢棄英、德海軍協定、並未引起多大驚異之情形、官方對此尙未加以批評、然據一般留心時事者之意，海軍協定之　　、並無任何重大之影響、反正以現時比率而論、德國海軍實無法追上英國、德國如欲草擬大規模建艦草案、則其疲乏之經濟、勢必益加感覺困難、况巨艦之建築、要非一朝一夕可以完成者、故德國卽使實行增建軍艦、亦僅能集中於潛艇而巳、</p>
<p>法</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎廿八日電】巴黎方面對於希特勒演說之第一反響爲「希特勒仍在延宕時日」、演說內容、並未一如想像中之粗暴、希特勒曾將强併捷克之理由反復辯護、此實受世界輿論之影響、英法兩國堅决態度、發生英國徵兵之舉、然此不過爲表示英法態度之開端耳、廢棄英德海軍協定、實不足引爲驚訝、蓋此舉早在預料中、德波協定之被取消、證明今後關鍵、仍在波蘭、同時更無理由足以構成民主國家維護和平之努力經巳氣餒之信念也、</p>
<p>【美聯社巴黎廿九日電】法國高級官員、昨日分在外交部與首相邸聆聽希特勒之演詞、據稱、此次演說、形式上不若前此各演說之猛烈、對希特勒宣佈廢棄英德海軍協定與波德協約兩點認爲極端嚴重、惟演詞中對法則尙無直接攻擊之處，彼等對希特勒攻擊英美表示憤慨、至于對整個演詞之態度則謂須待詳細研究後方能發表、</p>
<p>【美聯社巴黎廿九日電】此聞官方對希特勒之演詞、視爲一種狡點辯護、其于歐洲危局並無補于事、法國陸軍部巳證實法波同盟已完成、此間官方對于希特勒廢棄英、德海約、並不驚奇、並謂德國海軍實力、實難超越英法、德國或祇能增建潛水艇而巳</p>
<p>羅</p>
<p>【路透社羅京廿八日電】德國之宣佈廢止德波協定、適足以促進波蘭、羅馬尼亞之合作聯繫、據稱、羅外長　芬科囘國後、巴爾幹協約國將在羅馬尼亞京城再次舉行會議、討論保加利亞領土要求問題、預料巴爾幹協約國對於領土改移之主張、其堅决態度、一如往昔、惟對保加利亞、將允作經濟上之合作、</p>
<p>意</p>
<p>【路透社羅馬廿九日鴛】蓋達頃在「意大利日報」發表一文、表示極端擁護希特勒之演說、謂「由此可見德、意將不至被動的置身於被包圖之政策中」、</p>
<p>【美聯社華盛頓廿九日電】「意大利人民報」今日宣稱、羅斯福爲愚蠢與投機之人、希特勒拒絕其無賴與狡詐之建議、巳使歐洲混沌之大局廓然一淸、該報復稱羅斯福爲『河馬』、並謂希望此番敎訓、足令羅斯福莫敢再管他人閒事、</p>
<p>日</p>
<p>【路廿社東京】九日電透此間各報對於希特勒之演說、咸刊於顯　地位　對之極為煊染、「朝日新聞」著文批論、謂英、美、法曾將任何戰事發生之責任、綏諸德意身上、觀此次希特勒之演說、便可證明此為無據者矣、德意兩國、現正試行避免用此可怕方法、以完成其要求、惟英、法兩國、仍冀望維持現狀、最後終將引起國際發生戰爭云、</p>

<p>【路透社柏林廿九日電】頃據此間宣稱、政府當局曾將希特勒演辭一份、遞交美國駐德代辦、以爲對羅斯福總統建議之答覆、</p>
<p>【路透社華盛頓廿八日電】議會若干人士、對於希特勒演說之口吻、經巳表示極端不滿、有謂之爲叫囂與故作大言者、衆院外交委員會代理主席白倫謂「希特勒一面大談世界和平、一面却向波蘭提出嚴重之最後通牒」、參議員彼拉認爲希特勒已視其演說爲「終止世界和平談判之舉」云、</p>
<p>【中央社華盛頓廿九日電】消息靈通方面稱、希特勒演詞僅予富於幻想者以微弱之希望而已、希特勒廢棄英德海軍協定，德波條約一節、爲評論演詞全文最適宜之標準、希特勒答覆羅斯福總統和平電文一節、足以顯示希特勒對於價値之觀念、與西方傳統之觀念相反、凡屬具有西方思想之人士、孰不痛心、吾人雖不能就此摒棄一切希望、惟維繫和平之工作、須賴人類的全力以赴、則由此而可見突、</p>

<p>日來美國援華制日運動，有積極發展之勢，廿八日華盛頓電，美參議院擁護政府在遠東採取强硬外交政策者，正積極向議會進行對日本施用經濟制裁，參議員蓋諾氏，廿七日在外委會要求議會當局授權總統實施禁物運日，同時以物質援助被侵略國家。曼德彼特大　敎授佛萊明主張卽行召囘美國　日大使，並增加對華戰時貸款，修改中立法，以免爲侵略　所利用。</p>
<p>美國援華制日運動的日趨高漲，第一是日本侵略者之步步進逼，威脅美國，誠如檀香山中鮮僑民聯會主席簡氏廿七日在美衆院外委會所述：『五年後日本將要求美國容許日本移民，縱令美國不允，日本最低限度亦將取獲阿拉斯加，薩摩亞島及夏威夷等地之移植權』！第二，則是我國的堅持團結抗戰及形勢的急轉優勝，增加了美國對我國勝利的信心和援助的决心。</p>
<p>我們現在一面要極力支持與推進美國這種援華制日運動，一面還要加緊發展英法等國，目前日本正在拚命推進反英運動，，如果說「五年以後日本將强求美國允許移民」，則目前日本對英法的行爲巳經是强求英法允許退出遠東了！客觀環境巳在壓迫英法出而反抗，我們就要適應這種形勢，推進英法繼美國之後，急起直追，進而建立遠東的反侵略陣線、建立遠東集體安全制度。</p>

<h3 id="c36">武漢合唱團離港後　把救亡宣傳廣佈到星嘉坡一帶去 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>提到『武漢合唱團』，那些動人心肺的救亡歌聲好像就繚繞在耳邊似的。在任何一個歌詠的場合裏，要是聽到：「打回東北去，打回東北去！」『他殺死我們同胞！』『他侵略我們土地』『　　　　』，這些雄壯而協調着節奏的歌聲，立刻，又會敎人聯想到『武漢合唱團』的種種。</p>
<p>香港的音樂水準並不低，直如音樂國裏一塊肥沃的土壞。可是，救亡歌曲在這裏播了種，萌了芽，武漢合唱團不能不說是一個園丁。</p>
<p>自從去年十二月中旬該團離開香港到新嘉彼之後，本港歌詠界突呈活躍的氣象。他們在新嘉坡的工作亦進行得非常順利。日前，該團戲劇組組長項堃君從新嘉坡來港，記者遂在六國飯店得到一個把晤暢談的機會。談吐之間項君充溢着工作得來的快感，記者亦跟着他愉快起來。</p>
<p>武漢合唱團在武漢出發的時俟，對於戲劇沒有什麼準備，以致去年抵港公演只是一種實驗與嘗試，成績是比不上歌詠的精彩，這未始不是美中不足的地方。因爲該團在名稱上雖然是「合唱」，而事實上却是一個普通的宣傳工作隊。爲了加强戲劇陣容，項君不遠千里而來本港招兵買馬，預計羅致二名女角，一名男角。不數日間報名者一來就幾十人，可惜幹練的演員多數巳參加團體工作了。談到錄取的標準，據說，除會說流利的國語外，應該對于救亡話劇有高　的熱情與誠懇的態度。取錄後的新演員衣食住行概由該團供給，日間卽偕項氏一同南波歸隊。在項氏苦心努力之下，該團的話劇前途巳經透露着無限的曙光了。</p>
<p>他們在新嘉波工作了四個月，公演了一百多次，爲當地籌賑會籌得了國幣三十萬元，新嘉波的救亡高潮，更是澎湃起來。他們不僅在高等戲院感動了上層階級。而且在平民階層發生了宏大的作用。他們不僅僅合唱而巳。每次的演出都是以歌詠與戲劇互相配合的姿態出現，這就是他們進步了的作風。很多的救亡團體，都是這樣在實踐中生長起來。</p>
<p>僑胞對於他們的敬愛，眞是無微不至了，大富翁開放了花園殷勤款待他們，廣大的橋胞有了什麼就献贈什麼。賑聯會說聲武漢合唱團團員鞋子壞了，就有人送鞋子來甚至於理髮，亦經常有了理髪店前來報效。他們的生活，簡直成爲華僑的「公猪」。在僑胞方面深深感奮「公家」有「猪」可養。合唱團朋友亦深深感奮「公猪」所得到的精神安慰是過去的大學生活與敎師生活所夢想不到的快樂，他們更深刻地體驗到爲祖國效勞，做了「公猪」，是多麼的榮幸。</p>
<p>囘憶他們在武漢出發的時候，蔣夫人嘗慰勉他們：『國家正在需財孔急的時候，你們能够獨立不用國家的錢是再好不過的；要是將來經濟有了困難，當然會立刻給你們援手的，你們好好幹罷！』</p>
<p>現在看來，他們不但沒用着國家的分文，而且籌得的三十萬元國幣亦掃數歸公。他們的日常生活，就是在華僑賑聯會及熱心僑胞的欵待當中過着愉快的日子。這裏得到了一個啓示：『精神的安慰勝於物質的報酬；公忠體國的努力，一定能够博得同胞之愛護與援助。』</p>
<p>他們除了以歌詠與戲刺從事宣傳與籌狄之外，對於自我敎育及當地的聯絡工作，亦是沒有放鬆，新嘉坡各州府的華僑團體聞風遂紛紛教請前往表演，把預約時間統計一下，走遍馬來半島各埠頭，非花二三年的時間不可，因此把各方面預約的時間都打了一個對折：二月的改爲一月，一月的改爲半月，二週的改爲一週，本月初旬間經巳離開新嘉坡到柔佛去，現在仍在　佛工作。預計明年二月，可以完成遊歷馬來半島的任務，重囘到新嘉　來。</p>
<p>他們在將離別新嘉波的時候，嘗和當地音樂團體舉行過一次隆重的音樂大會，又嘗單獨公演過一次「雷雨」。目的就是在救亡宣傳之後，再讓僑胞了解祖國的藝術已經進步到這田地，藉以鼓舞僑胞的民族自信心。仳們在公演「雷雨」的時候，特別宣傳其用意，在於「藝術」與「倫理」的倡導，只是一種副作用，與原木救亡宣傳任務並無抵觸。經得到僑胞的諒解，籌款的收入亦突增起來，僑胞還紛紛要求他們繼續公演。</p>
<p>據項君語記者：新嘉坡的國語程度，音樂程度都很高，話劇卻像沙漢一樣。他們原來二十八位男女傳員在星時巳增加了幾位音樂人材，可是話劇的人材却不得不到香港來物色。他們這次長征能够有這般收獲，主要的一個原因就是健全的宣傳工作隊與藝術團體到星洲去，這是第一次。</p>
<p>他們的工作感動了僑胞，僑胞的愛國熱忱亦感動了他們，尤其是幾百萬家產的富翁，慨然鼓勵自家子弟參加機工隊囘國服務。愛國的熱血互相對流；愛國的赤誠互相感應，有中國人的地方就交織着可歌可頌的場面。祖國是多麼偉大；祖國的前途是多麼光明！</p>

<p>九龍華人靑年分會、鑑於在半島晨宿街房之貧苦兒童、缺乏敎育、誠恐其定入歧途、遺害社會、遂聯合馬頭角協思女學校校長、西人姑娘卜氏、及慈善家多人、在半島各處設立夜校多所、校內之敎職員、俱屬由熱心家義務担任者、據該校敎員華卓權對記者稱、此等學校開設巳四閱月、分在油蔴地、旺角、深水埔、紅磡、九龍城、尖沙咀、各區設立一所、收容在道旁露宿的兒童入學肆業、由敎師向彼輩灌以公民教育各種課程、及唱歌等知識、查該校初辦時，極爲困難、現各童巳明瞭此種措施、係對其有裨益者、故紛紛入學、查各區之校地、係由熱心敎堂或學校報效者、如無地點、則在他人之花園或街邊舉行、至於各校之敎職員俱由熱心者義務祖任、且各人俱有職業、故不能每晚出面担任、現定每星期四及星期日晚由下午六時半開課、至八時半止、現名區來學之兒童、共有千餘人、敎員廿名、如遇休假日、則領導兒童往各處旅行、以增長其智識、至於校內之經費、係由慈警家報效云、</p>

<h3 id="c38">香港劇運新階段 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>「黃花崗」是光榮的紀念碑！</p>
<p>香港之受西洋話劇的洗體，比內地為早；可是，那是限於外國人和幾個「華人紳士」，和一般民眾甚至於智識份子都是沒有關係的。除了受上海文明劇的「白話劇」曇花一現之外，香港的知識分子之接受話劇，一般地說起來，是在接受電影（特別是模仿西洋的國產電影）之後。</p>
<p>和其他各都市一樣，話劇最初是學校的愛藝者，當做戲劇文學之實驗的方式而實踐着。接著，就是游藝會裏不甚重要但又不可少的項目之一。再次，是一兩個好的Prodoction施行公演到這裏籌款等。九一八之後，話劇在香港在知議份子中才成為一種運動。七七以後，話劇逐漸影響市民，影響大眾，而影戲與粵劇，至少在內容上要接受他的暗示。過去的半年間，因為戰事的深入，職業劇團的南來，內地工作者留港者的加多，和民眾到話劇需要的提高，話劇運動遂寫就了光榮燦爛的一頁。</p>
<p>無疑地，演出是大規模地增加了，技術是高度的進步了，漸漸，戲劇也可以成了一種行業，可以經常地努力，正常地發展，予等求娛樂的觀眾以消了毒而滋補的精神糧食，這情形，是自廣東成為戰區之後而愈益顯著。</p>
<p>可是，為了使話劇成為民族解放的福音，成為大眾的啓蒙者，使話劇服從幷服務民族利益，要香港劇運成為中國救亡戲劇運動有機的一環，我們還沒有方法樂觀，沒有方法滿足我們自己的工作。我們需要自我檢討，自我批判：需要更高多的團結，更有計劉地分工；需要加强自我教育，需要斯達克漢諾夫式的突擊精神。</p>
<p>我們要團結：只有這樣，大家才會親愛精誠，一致努力，不至於傳染「戲人相輕」或「爭生意」的商業劇塲的毒。我們要分工：各自為戰，其人力物力之浪費，感效之限於一隅，其損失是無可計算的，只有通過共同的意志，精密的分配，才會使戲劇更直接更有力地服務民眾，服務國家，我們要建立自我教育，只有這樣，才能覺醒地，堅强地為民族的自由而戰，而不至於隨入以前「戲子」的泥沼，致成為抗戰的滓渣。我們要實踐突擊精神：只有這樣，在目前的艱苦環境之下，才能挺這胸膛，建立工作；只有這機，才能於訓練之後，深入地內，或進入火線，曾矢石為搶救祖國的生存而貢獻一切，犧牲一切。</p>
<p>香港的劇運不只是屬於戲劇工作者，而是屬於中華民族的子女，是屬於中華民族的前途的。</p>
<p>香港青年協會的成立，在香港的劇運史中，是一件劃時代的事件。靑年而純潔，熱情的戲劇工作者聯合起來了，他們將成為銅銑一樣的隊伍，從廣東來的經過抗戰鍛練的工作者，更增加了生力軍，再和時代中藝中旅的幾個比較演出經驗豐富的劇團共同工作，香港戲劇界的統一戰線可以說是確立了。</p>
<p>「黃花崗」的上演，動昌了所有的戲劇團體，幾百人熱烈地參加工作，沒有此疆彼界之分，沒有利害輕重之念，大家只有一顆為祖國求解放的熱烈而雄壯的心！這，是破天荒的現象，是戲劇界在努力抗戰劇運的途程中一座光榮的紀念碑！</p>
<p>我們要記取這劇連的新階段：選擇能配合現政治形勢的劇本，集中全體工作者演出，極力求大眾化之實踐，使藝術感效與政治感效有機而統一地喧染於民埃大眾，而演劇的結果又直接貢献於救濟受難的同胞，或加强救亡的人力物力：這就是香港劇運現階段的特徵，也就是配合第二期抗戰戲劇工作應定的大路。</p>
<h3 id="c39">電影現實主義試論 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>現實主義是滲透於一切的藝衛部門之中的一種創作方法，它是人類自有歷史以來的藝衛活動和創作實踐所能達到的創作方法的最高峯，是從來人類的藝衛手法底發展之最高階段，宅指導着一切的作家們如實地反映現實，表現現實，引領着作家們去發掘和創造完整的藝術形式，它是「典型環境下曲型的諸性格」底客觀的眞確描寫之最有力的道求方法，作家由於把握了它，才能深刻的接近于客觀的現實，才能發見和矯正世界觀的錯誤，這種現實主義的方法，乃是人類全部藝術史之最高的總合的批判成果，它不僅存在於今日一切電影以外的藝術部門裏面，而且。它更以一種非常的力量，强烈地滲透於電影藝術之中。</p>
<p>電影，這一種最近代型的藝術，對於近代的現實主義，是有着無限的適應性和需要性的。電影藝術的本身，是人類社會的科學技術高度發展時代的一種產物，它一方面有機地融合了人類各種藝術部鬥之積極的因素，一方面又具備着它本身所獨有的技術的（機械的）特質，從而在一般的藝衛因素與特殊的技衛條件底互相交流互相結合之中，建立其完整的形式，這種形式，帶有着濃烈的完全的綜合性，新生性，形象性和羣眾性，無疑地，這樣的形式，是只有適于應用現實主義，也只有在現實主義的創作方法底引導之下，才能獲得它的發展，才能獲得它的成功，現實主義，作為一種優越的指導的力量，作為電影剏作的基本方法，給予雲影以藝術的深化和精練，使之成為完全的藝術形式，賦予它以現實的藝衛內容，因此，現實主義是作為一個有機的構成部分，深深的進入於電影藝衛之中，並且成為電影藝術之主要的生命。</p>
<p>電影的現實主義，對于整個的電影的剏製過程，足以產生完全的决定的作用，它一方面指導着電影的剏製者認識現實，引領他從雜複的現實之中把握基本的東西，支配着電影製作的認識過程；另一方面它又指導着電影製作者表現現實，影響他的技巧，手法與風格，使電影藝術得以在最健全，最完善而旦最明朗的形象之中，如實地反映客觀的眞實，支配着電影製作的表現過程。不過現實主義對於電影的這種决定的力量。跟對於別的藝術部門所能起的力量，完全是相同的，這原是現實主義對一切藝衛部門的共通的作用，不是電影藝術所特有的，我們如要理解現實主義在電影藝衛上的基本的特點，就必須向電影的本質之中去探求。</p>
<p>電影的現實主義的特質，是存在於電影藝衛的本質之中，電影藝術，它是一般的藝術因素與特殊的技衛條件之有機的綜合，在作為一切藝衛的綜合之立場上，電影有的不祇是形象，而且它還有色彩和聲音，這些形象，色彩和聲音，都是電影反映客觀現實之基本的工具，然而，電影的形象，色彩與聲昔，如果僅祇作為規實的形象，色彩和聲音之複寫，那它就失去了它的特殊的獨立的藝衛意義，電影藝術之中的形象，色彩和聲音，應該不祇是現實的複寫，而應該是現實的形象，色彩和聲音底新的創造，電形的現實主義的特質，就在於從特殊的電影技術的有機運用之中，執行這種現實的創造工作，現實主義必須藉着它底創作方法上的優越性，配合電影技衛的特殊性，來貫澈這種創造，使人類各個藝衛部門所包含着的積極成分，與電影藝衛本身所特有的技衛特質，在新的創造基礎之上獲得新的配合，新的融和，這就是電影的現實主義底基本的特質。</p>
<p>電影是一種新興的潑刺的年靑的藝衛，它是植立於近代高度的文化積纍之上的一根嫩芽，只有獲得那個也作為人類文化積纍之一的現實主義創作方法的增育，它才能開出美麗的花朵，今日，為着賦興電影藝術以更加優美的完整形式，為著使電影藝衛的創造獲得全般的成就，電影的創製者們，必須努力從自身的藝術實踐與藝衛修養的增進之中，把握嶄新的現實主義。　四月廿六日暮忽促中。</p>
<h3 id="c40">活躍鬥爭在祖國　東江流動歌劇團 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 朱白水</p>
<p>在前兩個月底一個晨光曦微中，廣九列車拖走了十幾個靑年的工作者，離開了淫靡的香島，向漫天烽火的祖國底懷抱奔去。</p>
<p>綠絨的旗幟飄揚在高空，鮮明地绣着「東江流動歌劇團」。</p>
<p>他們原就是一夥回到東江一帶作抗戰宜傳和組織民眾的服務團，以歌詠和戲劇的形式為中心工作，配合著一個宜傳工作隊所有的力量和技能，作流動式的宜傳工作。</p>
<p>很明顯的，當×人第一次侵攻東江而退潰之後，退留下的是殘瓦敗垣和慘酷悲痛的囘憶；現在，×人又準備着第二次進攻的陰謀的，那麼，在保衛東江的緊急號召下，加强民眾組織和民眾敎靑是急需的。</p>
<p>東江一帶海外僑胞所組織的「東江華僑回鄉服務團」成立谷分團于各縣區外，並于很短期間內組織一流動式的歌詠戲劇團體，巡迥東江各地工作。</p>
<p>東江流動歌劇團」，就這樣于二月十一日打香港出發了。</p>
<p>……勇敢地橫貫東江的腹部</p>
<p>從深珊丟了火車開始了長途跋涉的向坪山進發，當天抵達了坪山墟，受到坪山游擊區的熱烈底迎接，在那裏工作了三天又向淡水移去，這樣的流動，使他們在兩個月當中勇敢地橫貫了東江的腹部！</p>
<p>從坪山開始，經過淡水，週田，雙田，麻溪，良井，平山，三多竹，赤石，夏港，梅攏，直到最近進至海鹽縣，而達到海豐縣城那裏。</p>
<p>這是一條怎樣悠長而艱辛的長征啊！</p>
<p>在這長長的行程中，他們發揮了歌詠與戲劇最高度的力量，尤以後者的效果收到很的功大每到一能，個地方，他們都演出戲劇去宜傳，提高民眾抗戰認識和情緒。</p>
<p>沿途工作所獲得的印象最佳的是坪山，淡水，週田雙田和麻溪，這幾個地方都曾經×人騷擾或×機轟炸，因此民眾對×人的認識很明白，宣傳也易做，工作也易收効果。</p>
<p>尤以坪由和週田較好，坪山有惠寶人民抗日游擊隊在那裏幹得很好，民眾認識很高，而週田則因該她文化水準相當高，人民抗戰情緒也很膨漲，該地自動組織的抗敵同志今已有五百餘人參加，婦女佔數尤多，前途很有希望。</p>
<p>但經過三多竹等地則表現得不如了，單以三多竹而言，該地人民到抗戰認識數淺非常，宗族觀念也很重，尤其是「恐日病」很普遍地佈散着，在抗戰進至現階段當中，廣大的農村仍播流着這種現象是很不好的，這更明顯的指出我們的民眾動員是不够，仍需要我們急亟地去，工作的！</p>
<p>……燃起海丰城抗戰的烽火</p>
<p>海豐縣在東江是一個較大的縣份，在革命時代，曾感受過大時代的洗禮和鍛練，然而，正因如此，在目前牠却殘徐而頑固地遺傳着舊有的力量，這種力量有的力量是足以妨礙新的抗戰形勢底發展。</p>
<p>但，當東江流動歌劇團于三月十三日抵達這古舊的縣城後，這樣英勇的燃起熱烈的抗戰烽火了。</p>
<p>先後和當地政府和各民眾社團接洽和聯絡後，卽開始。各方面的工作，在卅一日晚應黨部的邀請，參加「海豐各界演劇籌贈前方將士鞋襪大會」的演出，劇目是「血洒情空」，「死裏求生」，「毒麵」，「夜之歌」並有海平中學的歌詠隊，縣立二小的孩子劇「紀念堂」等，成績很好。</p>
<p>後來又在中山紀念堂演出，「有力的出力」，「死裏求生」，「太陽旗下」等，並舉行街頭演講，一仙運動等工作，跟着應該地第二區第四區的邀請到該處作巡廻工作，負實戲劇指導及民眾組織，在很短期內，以最大力量掀起海鹽底抗戰浪潮</p>
<p>最近擬和該地的「未名劇社」，「靑年抗×同志會」，「婦女會」等社團聯合演出「雷雨」及「保衛蘆溝橋」等，所得疑項，作成立戲劇協會的經費，這對海丰救亡劇運是很重要的。</p>
<p>……更強靱的鬥爭在祖國土地上</p>
<p>在兩個月鬥爭的程過中，他們更深刻的認淸自己責任的重大，更感到廣大的工作需要加強開展，因此原有的伙伴不够了，該團于是恢人回港補充及增加新的團員</p>
<p>記者昨晤是次回港負責增補團員的政治指導員陳一民君，得詳告該團工作過程，並且談及在目前不單在那一個地方都急亟需要靑年工作者囘去工作的，實在，廣大的民眾太需要我們去組織和救育了，尤其是在一人作最後掙扎的殘喘搏鬥當中，總動員民眾去保衛家鄉是急不容緩的！</p>
<p>這寶貴的而急切的號召對香港的青年工作者，是如何的重要啊！</p>
<p>這次囘港于很短期間找到了五位新的靑年伙伴參加了，兩位女的三位男的，都是對戲劇歌詠很有能幹和很有工作魄力的，這新的鬥士，將使他們更強勁更活躍的鬥爭在祖國底土地上了！</p>
<p>現在，他們又踏上新的征途而離開香港乘着帆船到海鹽去了，將更充實的在海鹽工作一月，再到河源，紫金等縣流動而巡迴的工作，希望將東江上下游走遍。</p>
<p>祝福他們：永生地鬥爭在烽火遍地的祖國懷抱」</p>

<p>— 夥兮</p>
<p>——五月三日起在太平戲院——</p>
<p>「以熱血灌開自由花，用白骨築成凱旋門。」沒有「三二九」，何有了「雙十」；沒有民國的始基，何有這次的民族抗戰；沒有這次的民族抗戰，何有勝利的明天！在抗戰方酣，勝利就在目前的今天，歌頌先烈捨身成仁流芳萬世的精神；籌疑撫恤抗戰陣亡將王家屬以慰先烈於九泉之下——這，該是一樣多麼偉一大的義舉！</p>
<p>最近，香港各界賑濟華南難民聯席會，為撫卹陣亡將士家屬，特邀請全港各團體戲劇舉行聯合大公演，這次籌欵献演的劇本，恰巧就是「黃花崗」。這劇本的完成，是二十多位前進戲劇家集體的創作，戲劇界空前的成就。它把中華民族最悲壯最偉大的史蹟，活生生地在舞台上眾現出來。</p>
<p>這次的籌欵公演，是聯合了四十多個戲劇團體，動員了前後台三百餘人，充分表現本港戲劇界空前未有的團結。各界賑聯會積極籌備，熱心賢勞的精神，亦是巷香港僑胞寫上一頁光榮的歷史。</p>
<p>「黃花崗」原是定於黃花節公演的；可是因籌備不及與審愼安排，才决定五月三日起，一連三天，在太平戲院演出。這更可以象徵黃花雖落，我們却永遠不忘烈士的功勋。</p>
<p>「黄花網」的導演團是歐陽予倩，胡春冰，鐘啓南，黃澯霖，盧敦，譚國恥等劇運的先進。月來積極排練，將來演出料必是一嗚驚人。</p>
<p>日來賑聯會黃花崗演出特委會積極籌備，工作已有端倪了。現在的問題只有等着我們去認銷入場券，，帮忙推銷入場券。查票價定五元，三元，一元，三角，四種，量力輸將，難道還有推辭的餘地嗎？烈士流血，演員及工作者流汗，我們却鑑員最進步的獻劇藝術，最接受革命的洗禮，這還有所吝裔嗎？</p>
<p>還得記住；這次義演所得的款項，是為着撫恤抗戰陣亡將士家屬啊！</p>

<h3 id="c42">七四一次的演出 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 王莹</p>
<p>轟炸後第一次的演出——在徐州</p>
<p>是新秋，徐州的黃沙彌漫着天空，轤車轤轤地滾着，一種北方的情趣盡似地展開着。氣候特別地熱，大街小巷往來着如梭的人，雜踏，鬧熱，不時有一羣羣武裝的弟兄，政治工作者，自衛隊，嚴肅地通過。土牆上白字的大標語張貼得到處都是；戰爭的空氣已在這古城市裏瀰漫着了。</p>
<p>在車站上，武裝的弟兄很仔細地察問我們，當他們看到了軍事當局給們我的護照後，便很和善地讓我們通過。</p>
<p>「前線打得很好吧？遭一次我們可再不能退讓了，他媽的××鬼！」他徵笑而直爽地說，黃色的手溜彈在那灰色的軍服上襯托得十分醒目。</p>
<p>出了大馬路，民眾敎育館的同志們手挽手的來接我們。館內新落成的一座小禮堂，可容五百人，我們便住在禮堂後面兩間屋子裏，他們忙着挑水，倒茶，寒喧；我們忙着告訴他們出發的經過，問徐州的民眾運動的情形，及到徐州後凖備做的工作。</p>
<p>「很好，很好，」館長趙君說。「此地正需要你們，你們來一定可以給知識界和民眾們一個不小的影響的。」</p>
<p>「關於觀眾方面，支配看戲的事，完全托你們」；我們說：「因為我門是不熟悉徐州的情形的。我們的原則是一，不賣票，二，不慕捐」。</p>
<p>「不賣票怎麼行呢？」趙君接着說了：「場子小，豈不是不能容很多的人麼」。</p>
<p>我們一向是分兩種方法演出的，一種是在舞台上，一種是街頭，在禮堂演時，請印點票分發吧。</p>
<p>就這樣决定了我們在徐州的演出。</p>
<p>近傍晚的時候，夕陽照着敎育館的花圃，紅的花，白的花，都更顯得柔和了。空氣是十分寧靜的，遠遠的天空上忽然有很沉重而混濁的吼聲，「這是什麼」？我們停止了排演工作，問着旁邊一位敎育館的同志。「這是牛車呀」，他回答。初到徐州，牛車的聲音究竟怎樣，我們是不十分明白的。</p>
<p>我們繼續地排戲，另一堆同志禮練練習唱歌，準備晚間廣播，但不到兩分鐘，有六架重轟炸機張牙舞爪地向着我們來了。大家都仰着頭，心裏忖度着：「這聲音靠不住，是×人的！」還來不及再往下想時，作彈雨似地落下來了；穿灰衣服的高射機關槍手，急急地走到陣地，婦人抱着小孩亂竄。「不要走路，快些睡下來呀！」伏在花叢下的我們的同志大喊着。「我是開機關槍的」；灰衣服的弟兄在土坡內的陣地裏立時發楊火力。</p>
<p>砰！砰！砰！哎呀！糟糕，怎麼我們剛臥倒機關槍陣地的旁邊呢！可是，沒有法子，祇得不動地躺在那裏，彈片，火球，坭土，察察地從我們身邊飛過。不遠的一座山頂上發若震耳的倒場聲。這樣毫無目標的屠殺繼續了廿分鐘，那飾着醜惡太陽標幟的空中强盜，才在我們機槍威力下邇去了。</p>
<p>天漸漸地黑了下來，集合的軍號從北車站，嘹亮地送個每個人的耳中，火軍的汽笛高呌着，六列火車安全地開出了。×機主要的目是炸我們列車的（車上滿是開赴前方的武裝兄弟），可是却把炸彈全落在子房山上，把住在山頂的工程師的房屋和全家都炸燬了，祇留下年老的工程師獨目凄慘地活着。但後來他的親愛家人的血，却使他在隴海路的工作發揮了積極和想彿不出的効能。</p>
<p>司理警報人員立時免職處分。</p>
<p>夜間，全城沒有電燈，沒有月，沒有星，一片片烏雲在天空游移着，驚報尖銳地連續發出兩次，人民都異常地驚醒和鎭靜；在黑夜裏靜靜地走到防空洞。我們在濕的草地上一個接一個的在暗中摸索地走進敎育舘建築的小防空壕，敎舘的同志們已先在那裏了。這時，我們便詳細地討論工作，决定第二天晚上，在禮堂招待各界。劇目是我們集體創作，以活報方法演出的「保衛組國」。</p>

<p>「一年間」將演出</p>
<p>夏衍今召開演委會</p>
<p>救亡日報總編輯，各戲劇家夏衍氏，自蒞港後，對本港救亡戲劇連動，貢献頗多。近更擬號召留港劇人聯合公演其最近名作「一年間」。為國內文化事業籌募基金，此事曾一度招待留港名導演名演員等，商談公演事宜。當即成立演出委員會。現定今日下午四時假座聖斯酒店東邀留港戲劇界名流，歐陽予倩，蔡楚生，司徒慧敏，唐槐秋，金山，王瑩，胡響冰，蘇怡，盧敦，陸浮等，開第一次演出委員會會議，討論一切進行事宜云，</p>

<p>上週分別公演名劇</p>
<p>這一週的劇運，眞是熱鬧，除「黃花崗」在加緊排演外，演出的有「中藝」和「中旅」。「中藝」自廿七日起，一陣幾天在中央戲院演出法國文眾囂俄原著張道藩改編的「狄四娘」，法國莫里哀原著的「偽君子」，歐陽予倩編的「靑紗帳裏」等新劇，獲得空前的好評。這實在是中藝第三期公演裏的一個成功的收穫。</p>
<p>「中放」重建後，廿八日為婦女聯會義演第一齣吳祖光的「鳳凰城」。這齣戲的演出，是相當的成功，牠無欵地奠定了新生「中旅」的基礎，</p>

<h3 id="c46">甲組足球亞軍爭奪戰　東方會擊退海軍　三比二勝利躍居第二把交椅　三位上海球人曹秋亭最出色 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】昨天午後四時的加路連山、高朋滿座、有中有西、　計人數、半萬以上、可謂東方足球隊自晉　甲組以來、最叫座的一次、</p>
<p>這幕競賽、事關重要、為的是甲組聯賽亞軍一席、决之於此、如果力得勝、便完成我華隊包辦冠亞兩軍的創作</p>
<p>「人窮見志、事急見戲」、東方因賴南華南間接造成機會、得有此次亞軍爭奪戰、果然眾志成城、為勝是務、雖以南征甫歸傷據過半之帥、出戰以逸待勞的海軍、也能奮勇從事、一戰而捷、躍居「第二把交椅」、</p>
<p>依我所見、昨戰東方得勝、完全基於加强前衛線力量的成功、假如不是臨時更調得法、而照報紙豋載的一樣出戰、怕不會有此成績、</p>
<p>許竟成、劉始讚二人、演出極爽快、頭頭是道、雖位置俱禾見得當、然因奔跑迅速、膽之在後、忽然在後、故足以彌補不足、很少破綻、進退一致、呼應前後、遂時收聯絡之效、</p>
<p>東方陣裏、最給米民注意的、是那三位上海球人、故彼輩表演如何、值得一述、右內衛江善敬、工夫當稱穩健、不失名將丰度、惟動作略慢、此或放棄足球過久所致、如下半時所負囘第二球及最後一秒鐘那次大驚險、都由老江纏不住摩理士、致弄出危機、然而、這不單是老江個人的責任、不過他最後適當其衝而已、</p>
<p>許文奎在上半時任右內鋒、至下半時則與於洽興對調、看來老許動作甚慢　有不應失漏的球、常輕輕給對方守將奪去、也不擅衝刺、惟運傳頗中肯、此乃昨天我們所見他的唯一好處、</p>
<p>左翼曹秋亭、表演出色、為的錄線第一人、他腳頭够勁、突擊迅速、海軍守將　尼組路及哥連臣、遇着他即頭痛、奈何不得、惟他因善於伺際突進、常犯越位、正如侯澄滔一樣、</p>
<p>東方所勝第一二兩球、俱出其不意的收獲、頗有運氣、第三球則射得清楚玲瓏、故其有此戰功、半由倖致、亦半由人力、</p>
<p>全賽中、最值得稱道的、是徐亨在最後一秒鐘力挽狂瀾、可謂回天妙手、假如遭此一失、便須加時再賽、那末、東方的亞軍地位、或會跟着加賽而喪失了、故老徐此舉，不特為一已的佳作、最重要的却是保持東方的光榮、</p>
<p>海軍失敗的最大原因、壞在守鬥員的架臣表演失常、像失第一二兩球、不能不負一點責任、其次則為前鋒不擅射、而其全隊演出、亦不若去週戰南南時之精彩、祇與東方成一平均勢、堪稱悉工力敵、故東方得勝，亦非偶然、</p>
<p>兩陣對圓後、闢始接戰、始鑽送糧德祺、軒地力截、乃解圍而出、岩士德郎反攻、迫得角球、拖般截　出野、</p>
<p>四分鐘、岩士德郎邊傳拖般、迫近發射、掠門而過、摩士趕來不及、始讚力推出關、</p>
<p>五分鐘、東方全軍動員、德祺攻入、文奎從中照應、但近門沒法舉足、傳給炳土、因裁倒地上、失去機會、</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>『你道班傢伙用這種方法，來剝削和壓榨我們，一定是不得善終的！』兩個臉色鐵靑的姑娘，一邊罵一邊摔下樓去，她們發抖得連站也站不穩了，這是一個多麼凄凉的場面啊！</p>
<p>她們是是對賣雪糕的姑娘，因為從廣州逃難來香港，捱不了飢寒的煎迫，纔在小火輪上幹這拋頭露面的勾當。每月所得的代價，祇是十塊錢，而每天的工作時間，往往超過九小時以上，還要拿出五塊錢的按金，簽訂六個月的合同。為了要生話，無論如何艱苦，她們都得忍受的。可是，老板對於這種的苦的條件，還未滿意，突然將僱工制改為包工制；就是把每天三毛三的薪金，改換了推銷得一塊錢的貨物，給你半毫錢的佣，而且工作的時間，延長到十一小時以上，這　不是一個普通的人所能熬，的。於是這兩個姑娘便堅决提出反對，經過了多次的吵鬧，她們纔爭囘了放筆七折分扣的按金，不過還有幾十個和她同在壓榨下的　娘，沒有反抗的條件和能力，仍然是給繼讀的壓榨下去了。</p>
<p>一塊錢牛毛錢的佣，怎能活下去啊！也許有人驚奇地問？其實和道類相同的事件太多了。一個在織浩廠或者電簡廠的女工，常常每天祇有半毛錢到一毛半錢的薪金，加開夜工，多給你半毛錢，若是生實好。定貨擁擠，那末給你毛半錢，你便要通宵的工作了。經過幾天通靑工作的勞瘁，老　會很善意的給你幾天休息的機會，不過休息期內是沒有薪金的啊！</p>
<p>時代不斷的進化，資本家剝削勞苦工人的手段，也就日新月異他們最初利用女工的報酬低廉。便用僅她够們生活的報酬，僱用女工。後來為了堆進生產，便又採取按　給值的包工制使道些女工想着獲得多一點的報酬，并命的和他工作。最後，資本家伯覺得這種包工制還不怎樣上算，於是又囘復到僱工制，用最低度的工資，僱用這些女工，這種低賤的報酬，付了房和，還够吃飯嗎？然而千千萬萬的苦命女同胞，就這樣活下去了。而且很多很多的人，都用厭羨的眼光，徘徊在工廠的門外的啊！</p>
<p>飢餓决不僥恕人半分半刻的，為了生話，為了她全家人都要活着，她們沒工作的，祇會跑上最後一條路，通她們出賣皮肉的生涯，你看暗娼充斥，和那些導游社的好像是星羅棋佈一般嗎？這些從那兒來啊！為了整飭市政，和防止花柳等等傳染病的曼延，本港當局，也會幾次重申撲滅暗娼的禁令，和考慮取締嚮導社，然而所得的結論：就是「餓死」和「娼妓」祇相隔一線；所以「私娼」的問題。並不是掃除不掃除的問題。而是我們想不想她們繼續活下去的問題了。</p>
<p>我們并不是說：私娼是永遠不可淸除的。要怎樣淸除？就是使他們大家都有工作，都有飯吃。現在女青年會的勞工組對於女工　個問題是非常注意的，像設立夜學積極敎育和訓練她們，這倒是一個重要的問題。不過談到她們的生活改善，還沒有怎樣具體的辦法。當然，這并不是一個很容易解决的問題，而頃獲得當局的積極帮忙，和社會熱心人士的羣策　力，纔可以收得實効的啊！</p>
<p>機從封建的枷鎖解脫出來的女同胞，又遭遇到資本家這種可怕的壓榨。所以，今後的女同胞們，更須要覺預起來，　　　　　　　　　　，解脫一切玄同胞被壓炸的痛苦！</p>

<h3 id="c50">三多 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 千里</p>
<p>「三多一是一般人求之不得的標凖生活，至少大部份的中國人是這樣想的。像香港這塊地方，目前正是一般富人的聚匯處，而如且又是多妻風氣最盛的所在，想來享着這</p>
<p>「三多」福氣的人當不在少數。可是，我這　所說的三多，並不是什麼，多福二多壽，多男子的三多，相反地，却是生活的黑暗面。</p>
<p>那就是：肺癆病多，娼妓多，盜賊多。</p>
<p>據本港衛生署最近調查的報告，平均每星期發生肺癆病症有一百五十幾宗之多，因此而死的每週約在百人以上，總計全年共五十二個星期，依照衛生署的報告計算，助每年患肺癆病而的人當不下五穴千人，這種驚人的數字，遂迫得本港的衛生署不得不將其列入時症之列，而社會人士亦不免一時為之喘喘不安。於是遂有人認為如此猖獗情形，乃係無智識人民隨地吐痰所致，或則責備市民不知衛生。</p>
<p>我覺這班先生們的高見是很有眼力的，不過在目前米珠薪桂寸金地的香港，一般中下的市民每每因為樓租過昂而不得三數十人擠在一間只容得一個小家庭的樓上的情形，要怎樣去講衛生呢？這是值得我們注意的的。而且據目前日本等醫學博士的宜告，×國每年肺病的人亦不下百萬之衆，死者亦　十餘萬人，其原因，據說係由「營養缺乏』所致，想來香港的肺癆症，未必與此層無關吧。</p>
<p>其次，娼妓的數字也是非常高的，據上月本港救世軍年會。救世軍軍長柏賴沙氏的報成告，本港婦女因經濟環境所迫，出操醜業的，不下二萬五千餘人之眾，其間且有未年之女童不少，以　有百萬左右的都市，而娼欵成數竟達到如此數字，實不能不令人驚異了，假定百萬人中女子佔居半數，則全部亦不過五十萬人耳，遭五十萬幾頭，除開女孩及老太婆後，就算十五歲起全四十歲止，為適於當娼妓的年齡吧，至多恐亦只能打過半數，卽是二十五萬人，想想看，二十五萬人中有二禺五千餘是暗娼，遭不是說十個適年的女人中有一個係娼妓　？這是怎麼樣的一個比數，我簡直不敢再想下去了。</p>
<p>總之，多，多，多，多得要使道學先生叫苦運天，而使那班一向輕視女性，自家的男人們十分得意的了。可是若扯它和近　來搶劫竊盜的案件比起來，怕還不免要如小巫見大巫的可憐哩。</p>
<p>隨便你翻開報紙的一角來看一下吧，你就會馬上發現道里是搶刦，那里也是搶刧，這里是撈荷包，那里又是撈荷包，你隨便到甚麼公眾場所或郵局船車站去吧，你也會立刻發見幾個很刺眼的字樣：「當心撈荷包—』再不然你隨便到街頭去跑一下吧，你同樣很容易看到有些小孩子在搶香烟，或者偷雜質店或糖桌店的什麼東西，人們對於這些『不成器」的小孩，美其名曰「童匪」。</p>
<p>鳴呼，「童匪」之外有「童娼」，童娼之外又有『童肺癆」這是杳港的三大特色。而這三行之多，娼多，匪多，肺癆多，更成為香港的『三多』了。</p>
<p>如何去消滅這「三多』呢，有人說這是『人心不古」所以我們要從道德入乎。又有人說這是「敎育不良』，所以我們要努力敎靑。更有人說這係市民「不講衛生』所以才有這許多肺癆病，所以我們要提倡衛生，大家說來都頭頭是道，合情，合理，可是我却只記着一句老話，「衣食足然後知恥辱』。衣食不足，謀生無路，要市民不為娼盜是不可能的，要市民不肺癆也不樣不可能。</p>
<p>誰願意在風寒要雨的深夜，站在街頭，亂向不認識的途人求愛（？）受盡侮辱哩，誰願意，冒着性命的危險惶恐萬分只為着數元銀錢，更誰不自愛惜身體，願在空氣的濁沒有陽光陋室內，吃那沒有滋養的食物，致使身子衰弱，易罹肺癆病，沒有的，沒有人願意這樣，只要每個市民足衣足食，這令人不快的「三多』就會無形消滅了的。</p>
<p>但在香港這塊地方對於這層能够辦到嗎？別的不要說它，就以房租一項來說吧，從去年到現在普通租價都漲了不少，其中如本港最大業主某銀行所轄各家屋，平均起　在百份之百以上，其中並有漲到百份二百三百的，像這樣的盡張情形，就以屋租一項來講，亦已足以迫令全市為娼，為盜及或為肺癆患者了，而這　的不合理的加租，在香港是不受取締的，此香港之所以成為「三多」也乎。</p>
<h3 id="c51">打破幽囚 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>「時間」像一條溪流，從此我溯往險惡的急灘，亂石截斷水流，於是舊夢與我隔絕，忘記了平靜的水波，潮平的兩岸，江上的青山，渡頭的恬寂。耳邊喧蠶着灘頭的急響，山崖拔地千尋，迴成絕雙，乃阻隔了陽光，四顧蒼茫，我被禁錮在黑暗的深潭中。來自「昔日」，也還點着消逝的波痕，我用疑問的手撫摩：黑暗的急灘流乃牢牢地封鎖着這一葉輕舟，幽間，黑暗，而成永遠麼？</p>
<p>「沒有運續不斷的急　，沒有永遠的險惡，沒有長終的幽囚。」彷彿凌沓嶂之蒼蒼，有人聲在提示我。</p>
<p>徬徨於一絕緣的境，界於一孤島，六月來水國的生涯，像黃昏時　於帆影的落日。乘一葉輕舟，停滯在急　頭，突出的礁石，星羅棋布，隔絕舊日的流水，使我失却溫暖的四憶。卽使於這險惡的急　流，容與亦不可能了。我乃感受着變鎖的威脅，——時閒與空間的幽囚。</p>
<p>悄情地隱忍着，看落葉　織在泥土中，尋溫暖躲藏在被窩中，很明顯的季節又告訴我變更了。枯萎的枝頭，萌芽一二新綠。「該是生長的春天了呵！」衛開輕寒的鎖，拓開生命的活力。春天，生長的季節，我們不能再默默地　藏了，禁閉於幽囚，侷促於轅下，隱忍於强權，委身於枷鎖，受圍於圈套，聽命於鞭笞．</p>
<p>一春天生長的節季」，蠕動着每，根筋絡像蠶在桑葉上爬。漸漸我感到內蘊的精力有發作的必要。黑色的　，黑色的山，黑色的天，在我的四圍週繞着勢不可能，於是我將駕起我的輕舟，簡破週險急的　頭，從礁石中，從嗚咽波濤中？從　啼兩岸中。」</p>
<p>誰能忍耐呢—這慘酷的幽囚，沒有自由，沒有徜徉，沒有哭笑，沒有太陽，沒有溫暖，沒有生長。</p>
<p>野哭千家，夷歌幾處，生命的脚跡，輾轉在數尺見方的土垣內，緊接着死亡的邊錄，是那麼近且簡便。赭衣髠鉗的囚徒們，給黑暗寒冷封鎖着，雙目羞明，身體也失常地　庫。「時間」封鎖着舊日，「時間』亦復斷絕了遠方。</p>
<p>醒來的殘夢，往往不能憑信於枕頭。漏下一段春光來，從石壁之錢天。於是我記起：湖上的輕烟，江城的柳絮，花木深深的禪房，採茶時山中的「數雨」——</p>
<p>當我響往於徜徉的美好時，耳邊復有人提示我：工沒有建續不斷的急　，沒有永遠的險惡，沒有長終的幽囚。」</p>
<p>渡過險惡的　，渡過　急的水，渡選深深的潭。黑色的風，黑色的山，黑色的天，渡過兩耳，退向身後。試一移步換形，我乃然　影與紅霞，朝嵐與旭日。</p>
<h3 id="c52">學推 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 畎之</p>
<p>「他家屋上霜」，乾脆「萬管」，這是乖。然而「門前零仍要自掃』這到底這是吃力之事。那末，不掃又不好。如何呢？那，可以『推」推之別人：如不推，助不妨學起來。</p>
<p>推的方法很多：例如對面有人家，你就可以堂堂正正的昭告他說，這雪在他們前，他應該掃，　面如果沒有人家，你也可以理直氣壯地對左鄰石舍說，這雪在他們的鄰近，他們應該掃。左右如果沒有鄰會，你更可以一本正經地對過往的人說，這雪在他們走過的道上，他們應該掃。假使你能更進一步，　明這事的下降，是為了以上　些人的原故，你要他們掃，便更加可以振振有辭，使他們不得不聽從。假使你能够　到最後一步，證明這雪就是他們降下來的，或者是他們從什麼地方帶來的，那你就格外可以不費吹灰之力，叫他們掃得乾乾凈，大功告成，卽使他們因掃而死，只好死而無怨。</p>
<p>這方法，推，推在人身上，將過失，錯誤，一切倒霉，吃虧，受損失的壞事，都推在別人身上，而你　飄　然，坦蕩蕩，坐享其成，何等不美，當今有許多事業大，地位高，名譽廣，財產富，勢力雄的大好老，不論在政界，文化界，工商界，任何界，其所以到此地步的，其中一大部份，就因為精通這個推字訣。</p>
<p>有一件事情到他們的手裏，眼底，面前，或心中，他們决不立刻去辦。第一步，他們便先看這事是否與他有利。假使沒有利，他就推，他不惜用盡腦筋，費盡心思，施盡氣力，將這事推在別人身上，說道事不是他的責任，即使只要用些微的　筋，心思，或氣力，說可以辦成這事，他也不願意，他還是嬰推。</p>
<p>這當然，他們不是天生會推的，也學成功的，也許最初不推便辮不了，所謂吃不了兜着走，他們受了這種敎訓，而又有志的建功立業，就只好學，學這個推。久而久之，成為習慣，於是無推不施，無推不靈了。</p>
<p>不過　外的事情，，總也會有的：萬二門前有　，　得滿地，而　推之人，却　行人也沒有，將如何呢？難道果然勞動　駕，親自去掃不成？哪，還可以推，推之於無其人，鳥有先生，子盧子。換言之。凡學須化血本，總非合算，此雪的責任』旣無人可推，就不妨擱在那裏，不瞅，不理，或者視若無睹，由牠自已消融，由牠僵在那裏。要說前門不便走，儘可繞這走後鬥。後門也有雪，儘可走邊門，橫門；側門，旁門，其門甚多；寗願多用力於繞道，不願少甩力於一掃，　一掃卽失尊嚴，卽中變一貫政策，卽破壞不搖主義，甚並鞋子踏議，身體滑倒，還是不掃，實行其推。</p>
<p>這種推，推行於一切事，便是拖延，今天推明天，明天再推明天，——。不好的大事，如果因這種推而化為小事小事而化為無事，推者便可自幸有先見之明，故不及於禍，如果竟因其推而無事化為小事，小事化為大事，大事又是不利的，也竟可以說，推尙如此，不推又何以堪。反正都有理由，都可以推。</p>
<p>種推亦非一朝一夕，可以一蹴而幾不也要學，一旦學成，奧妙無窮：可以遠　災難，可以逢凶化吉；至少限度，雖無成功，也不失敗！</p>
<p>以上兩種推，前者是推得掉的活推，後者是推不掉的死推。兩者合而用之，推道庶幾盡矣。</p>
<p>最後，我們記得，還有『孔子辭以疾」這一推，却也不能不一學。這就是說鬼話，造　，賴，騙煞人勿價命，窮朋友來看你，須推不在家；要當兵，須推有殘疾，要捐錢，須推窮，要參加愛國運動，須…沒有工夫；有的在先，須推並無其事：在瓜田備身，須推　履，在李下伸手，須推整冠……此推學成，集推道之大成，可以與扎子媲美，稱推中至聖矣！</p>

<p>有些便拉了一條　着桅上的長繩在江岸上一步一步的拖着。他們底　衣上露出的　膊在朝陽下是異樣地鮮紅和赤壯的，黨　的臉上現出一種農民底忠樣的堅决表情，一種鬥爭的意思。我們的手足都因為終年的勞動而露出靑筋了，額上都有一些皺紋：這明顯地受過生話磨折的痕績了。</p>
<p>然而他們是快樂的，不論是年靑或年老，一有空便握着根大竹的烟旱，一口一口地吸着，談着鄉間的瑣事或祖上的掌故，有時也談到男女之間的韻事。他們也愛唱山歌。他們對生活是保守的：因此，他們是酷愛田圍甚於自己的生命，在這班夥伴之中有幾個是因為×機的矗炸以致失掉他們的家復妻子，而來船上幹這苦工的。他們常帶着的憤恨的腔調來訴許自己的遭遇。有時有會把它當作話一種命運的不幸而已。</p>
<p>江水是更　了，船常在淤泥上擱淺，夥伴們的汗珠大顆大顆的弔在腦門和額上，他們是有點力竭了，船駛得狠慢，直到見村莊上有炊烟時，我們的到船　豐川江口了。這是豐川縣最後的邊界了。鄉村　隔得很遠的，我在甲板上極目遠望　岸完全是一片秋後的茶乾色的田畝，在天邊邊是一個　峯巒重疊的荒山。太陽已快弔在天中了。我們的船已全停在這江口凖備開始做早飯了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Qualitative Change of Wartime Journalism <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Changjiang</p>
<p>(1) Political Capital Replaces Commercial Capital</p>
<p>What are the similarities and differences between the news work in the second phase of the War of Resistance and the first phase? We can determine from many aspects that the journalism in the second phase of the War of Resistance, compared with the first phase, has changed not only in quantity but also significantly in quality. It can be said that it is different from the first phase of the War of Resistance and also different from the period after the victory of the War of Resistance. During this period, although the Japanese invaders are at the end of their rope, they will try their best to make a final show of strength. When the dying embers of the enemy glow brightly, many inland cities may be harassed by them. Newspapers built on commerce, relying on advertising and distribution for their survival, will inevitably be shaken and gradually decline. Except for the two special zones of Shanghai and Hong Kong, although commercial newspapers still exist, advertising and distribution revenues have sharply decreased, the sources of paper and ink have become difficult, and the distribution network and readership have shrunk day by day. Therefore, local governments and stationed military units, in order to satisfy the spiritual food of the military and civilians, have to publish small, even mimeographed or lithographed newspapers in their respective locations. The political capital of the newspaper industry then replaces commercial capital. Therefore, we predict that the upcoming newspaper work will be very difficult and the form will also be very special.</p>
<p>(2) Human Foundation Replaces Material Foundation</p>
<p>After fighting for a full twenty months, the general newspaper industry in our country is still built on a material foundation. The most important thing for the newspaper industry is material resources (including financial resources). If we have money, we can hire editors and workers to run newspapers, and there are no other difficulties. In the latter half of the second phase of the war, the material foundation became unreliable. On the one hand, commercial capital was destroyed, and there was no extra financial resources to do as one wished. On the other hand, the necessary materials for newspapers were painfully felt to be unavailable, and there was no way even with money. Will the loss of the material foundation of the newspaper industry hinder its existence value? No, not at all. Instead, the newspaper industry shows a new posture and steps into a new era. Human activity replaces the material foundation, and human skills make up for the lack of material. In the future, as long as there are people, there will be newspapers, and the abundance or scarcity of materials is not important. With a radio and a mimeograph, one can publish brilliant newspapers. At this time, the newspaper is fluid, human-centered, and relies on the human spirit to make up for the lack of material.</p>
<p>(3) Unity-Based Replaces Region-Based</p>
<p>After the newspaper industry is built on a human foundation, new types of newspapers will appear throughout the country. Although their circulation is not wide and their economy is not good, their distribution is extremely even and deep, reversing the old problem of being lopsided and adjusting the bad phenomena of expansion and anemia. The most intense color of this period is human activity, requiring tens of thousands of news practitioners to open up this special new world. In the past, the news organizations, which were rich in regionalism, will be washed away and changed by the raging torrent of the great era. After that, new cadres are urgently needed. With the new cadres as the core, unite the surrounding members, and absorb young men and women who are enthusiastic about the newspaper industry to form an organic whole of news practitioners across the country, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, communicating what is available and what is not, and distributing them reasonably and appropriately throughout the country, regardless of before or after the Japanese surrender, and regardless of the front or the rear. The current tasks of news practitioners are first, unity, second, unity, and third, still unity. Only by taking unity as the foundation can we break through the current difficulties, achieve arduous missions, and contribute to the War of Resistance and national construction.</p>
<h3 id="e2">World Trends in a Week <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From April 23rd to 29th, Year 28 [1939]</p>
<p>The last week of April can be said to be a frightening period of calm before the storm.</p>
<p>In Europe, the struggle between the two fronts has shifted from a head-on conflict with arrows drawn and bows strung to each side's diplomatic activities. Among them, Germany and Italy's attempt to entice countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, the United Kingdom and France's consolidation of the Balkans, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Romania, and the Soviet Union's expansion of the anti-aggression front movement are most noteworthy. And it ended with Hitler's speech on the 28th. At the same time, in the diplomatic struggle, the war preparations of both sides are even more tense.</p>
<p>In the Far East, our active and advantageous War of Resistance against Japan continued to make significant progress. At the same time, the voice of expanding the anti-aggression front to the Far East shook both sides of the Pacific. Therefore, the Japanese aggressors were even more embarrassed. Although there were no important activities this week, new military and especially political conspiracies were being actively planned and even promoted.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and France Suddenly Seek Divine Help</p>
<p>Under the intensified threat and attack of the fascist aggressors, the capitalist governments of the United Kingdom and France adopted a policy of "suddenly seeking divine help." On the one hand, they tried their best to win over the Soviet Union, on the other hand, they vigorously promoted war preparations, and at the same time, they tried their best to maintain the small countries on the periphery?</p>
<p>This week, the United Kingdom and France continued to implement the above policies. First, regarding diplomacy with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France invited the Soviet Union last week to support peace in Eastern Europe. At that time, the Soviet Union had put forward concrete proposals (see "One Week" last Sunday). The United Kingdom and France immediately conducted consultations. According to a Reuters report from London on the 2nd, the United Kingdom and France are reviewing and can establish a compromise plan. Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, returned to Moscow on the 22nd and had important talks. Maisky left the Soviet Union and returned to the United Kingdom on the 23rd. People generally believe that the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are very smooth. Approximately the United Kingdom and France will each conclude a new agreement with the Soviet Union. Second, regarding the various small countries, the British government first attempted to create a neutral group in the Balkans (including Bulgaria) so that the countries could help each other and stabilize the eastern Mediterranean. The second is to stabilize Poland and Romania. The London "Sunday Times" on the 23rd stated that the attitudes of the two countries, Poland and Romania, have become clear and decided to revise the joint anti-Soviet agreement to meet the trend of the times. On the 24th, talks between the United Kingdom and Romania were held in London with the theme of expanding the relationship between Poland and Romania. According to the British announcement, the talks between the United Kingdom and Romania ended on the 26th with extraordinary success. However, in fact, whether the United Kingdom can seize these satellite countries from the hands of the German and Italian demons depends entirely on the United Kingdom's determination and strength to oppose aggression. Therefore, we see third, the British government hastily announced the implementation of conscription on the 26th, and formally notified Germany and Italy on the same day, expressing its firm opposition to aggression. The French cabinet also examined an important defense plan on the evening of the 21st, asking the people to continue to sacrifice. This kind of armed defense of democratic peace by the United Kingdom and France can indeed inspire people.</p>
<p>Important Statements from the United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The United States' attitude against fascism and aggression is more thorough and clear. First, it expressed its full support for the cooperation negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union (Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd). Second, the revision of the Neutrality Act has made great progress. The majority of congressmen advocate assisting the United Kingdom and France and implementing economic pressure on Japan (Washington, 14th). Third, US President Roosevelt submitted a bill to Congress on the 25th to create a new agency. He said: "In this autumn of lawlessness, when people are trying to destroy democratic governments, there are shameless people who believe that the institutions of democratic countries are becoming weaker and weaker due to the maintenance of democracy, so they are trying to act rashly. This reorganization of government institutions is also to answer their challenges!" Fourth, the United States is actively preparing military work to resist aggression and is promoting a great plan to increase the army, navy, and air force. In addition, it is also planned to mobilize 1.2 million people to participate in wartime work within a few months. The large fleet, which was ordered to return to the Pacific, passed through the Panama Canal on the 27th. Fifth, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is improving day by day. Air force cooperation negotiations are going smoothly, and the Soviet Union's non-stop flight also departed for the United States on the 28th.</p>
<p>The entire Soviet Union, from the Party, the government, to the vast masses, in the past, present, and future, is the most loyal member of the democratic peace front and the most heroic vanguard of the anti-aggression front. Recently, the facts show that first, it solemnly suggested to the United Kingdom and France to establish a broad collective security system to guarantee each other's territorial integrity with mutual assistance agreements, and its scope should also include the Far East (see the French Foreign Ministry mouthpiece "Le Matin" on the 22nd). Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also advocated that the general staffs of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should discuss concrete measures to assist the invaded countries. He also stated that if the general staffs of the three countries can determine the responsibilities shared by each country, the Soviet Union can prepare to assist Romania, Poland, and any countries in the British and French group (Associated Press, London, 22nd). Second, the Soviet Union has been working hard to organize a collective security system recently. Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin has visited various Balkan countries. On the 26th, he consulted with Bulgaria, which is being incited by Italy. On the 28th, he arrived in Ankara and discussed the Black Sea defense issue with the Turkish authorities. Potemkin will also go to Romania and other countries for talks. Third, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky left the Soviet Union for the United Kingdom on the 23rd due to the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. On the 27th, he went to Paris and first consulted with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu on aid to Romania. He will also have talks with France.</p>
<p>These actions of the United States and the Soviet Union are naturally of great help to the anti-aggression movement.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy are Struggling Hard</p>
<p>The German and Italian aggressors naturally have their countermeasures against the resistance of the democratic and peaceful countries. What's more, in the democratic peace front, the governments of the United Kingdom and France, while vehemently stating that they will no longer retreat, are still secretly opening the back door, hinting that there is still room for discussion! (The main fact is that the British and French ambassadors to Germany, who were once recalled due to Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, have now returned to their posts one after another. British Ambassador Henderson also met with the German Foreign Minister on the 25th, stating that if Germany has any further acts of aggression in the future, the United Kingdom will resist.) Therefore, the German and Italian aggressors can continue their aggression plans. The first is to implement a policy of threat and deception against the British and French group of countries. They are trying their best to win over Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and other countries. They are using the restoration of Bulgaria's lost territories as bait to lure Bulgaria into joining the anti-communist group; they are using the German-Romanian economic agreement to persuade Romania not to join the anti-aggression front; Italy is even using Hungary to win over Yugoslavia. Germany is also actively preparing to conduct direct negotiations with Poland (but Poland has refused). In addition, activities against Turkey, inquiries to Northern European countries on whether they feel threatened by Germany, etc., are all attempts to attack the anti-aggression front and reduce the value of Roosevelt's proposal. The second is to strengthen the unity of the aggression group. The first is to use Italy to make the South and Hungary understand each other; the second is the scheduled visit of the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Germany on the 28th. The purpose is to closely cooperate between Germany and Italy. In addition, an Associated Press report from Paris on the 25th also stated: Recently, Japan plans to return some of the mandated islands in the Pacific to Germany so that Germany and Japan can use them as naval bases; this plan is not only to strengthen the unity of the aggression countries, but also to prepare to launch a pincer attack on the democratic and peaceful countries such as the United Kingdom and France from the east and west! Third, Hitler delivered a long speech on the 28th, stating five points; "(1) Germany has not destroyed peace, and Roosevelt has no right to reproach Germany; (2) Germany has not participated in any world wars in the past 20 years. The National Socialist Party has repeatedly requested disarmament after taking office, which shows that Germany really loves peace; (3) All the countries mentioned in Germany's telegram to Roosevelt replied that they were not threatened by Germany; (4) The German government will no longer send representatives to any meetings that resemble the Locarno Treaty in the future; (5) Germany believes that the Anglo-German naval agreement and the German-Polish treaty have both become invalid." His speech, which tried his best to cover up his faults and manipulate his tone, first rejected the US peace proposal and then announced the Anglo-German naval agreement and the German-Polish agreement. The democratic and peaceful countries should give up their illusions and take a stronger anti-aggression front to strive for the establishment of a collective security system with strength!</p>
<p>Japan is Panicked</p>
<p>Under the increasingly fierce resistance of China, the Japanese aggressors were already trembling! How could they withstand the active progress of the international anti-aggression front! Therefore, the Japanese aggressors had to show their panic. First, after the news of the expansion of the anti-aggression front to the Far East spread, the Japanese authorities became anxious. On the 22nd, Tokyo's "Kokumin Shimbun", "Miyako Shimbun", etc., all attacked the democratic and peaceful countries with rogue scolding and intimidation, especially attacking the United Kingdom. "Miyako Shimbun" even claimed on behalf of the military: "The United Kingdom's actions of assisting China and being close to the Soviet Union have made the relationship between the United Kingdom and Japan increasingly tense, and have reached the point where the United Kingdom and Japan may fight each other." Then, the anti-foreign movement in the occupied areas of the Japanese army in China, especially the anti-British movement, became even more rampant. Second, the Japanese Five Ministers held a meeting on the evening of the 23rd to discuss their attitude towards the European situation. Although there was no concrete decision, they all felt that Japan would become increasingly isolated internationally, and they felt that the return of the US fleet to the Pacific posed a serious threat to Japan. The Tokyo "Hochi Shimbun" on the 24th even said that this was: "An act of provocation by the United States against Japan." Third, the opposition of the Japanese people to the anti-communist group and the internal divisions of the Japanese government became increasingly serious. As the Tokyo correspondent's report published in the London Times on the 27th said: "All the people of Japan, except for the military, are unanimously opposed to concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy. The majority of members of the Japanese cabinet also hold this view."</p>
<p>From this, we can see the large number of enemies that Japan has made internationally today and the dangerous environment in which it is in; from this, we can also see the seriousness of the internal divisions in Japan and the vague disappointment in the future of aggression. This is the first achievement of our adherence to unity and the War of Resistance, and it is also the first achievement of our opposition to Wang Jingwei and other "anti-communist peace" activities.</p>
<p>Of course, the Japanese aggressors still have new conspiracies. These conspiracies can be roughly divided into three points; first, with the German and Italian aggressors, under the rule of military阀专制, they can only increase unity. Although Hitler's speech on the 28th did not mention the Far East, in fact, they will divide and force non-aggressive countries from the east and west. The Associated Press report from Paris on the 25th, which stated that Germany and Japan colluded to build naval bases in the Pacific, can be regarded as a clear example. Second, Japan is further implementing intimidation and temptation against the United Kingdom and France in order to frustrate the United Kingdom and France's policy of uniting with the Soviet Union to aid China, and then to coerce the United Kingdom and France to mediate the Sino-Japanese War and force China to submit. Although this possibility has been reduced due to the increase in China's War of Resistance strength, it is indeed an unchanging strategy of Japan. As for the United States, it is trying to avoid conflict to avoid the interruption of the source of munitions and raw materials. As for the Soviet Union, it is making factual concessions to avoid suffering immediate losses. Third, against China, it will intensify the use of Wang Jingwei and others' "anti-communist peace" movement to sow discord between our government and the people and the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in order to undermine the cause of the War of Resistance and national construction and to coordinate with the plan of "consolidating the occupied areas and establishing a puppet central government" to prepare for the launch of a new military offensive.</p>
<p>The Situation of the War of Resistance in a Week</p>
<p>The above has briefly described the recent plans of the Japanese aggressors against China. As for the military aspect, the main purpose is still to open up the Pinghan and Yuehan railways and consolidate the occupied areas east of the two railways. At present, on the one hand, it is intensifying disturbances along the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. The situation in Wenzhou, Fujian, and Shantou is still very tense; on the other hand, it is moving towards northern Hunan in an attempt to seize Changsha and control the Yuehan Railway. All these actions are the factual manifestation of the above-mentioned operational objectives. In addition, in the northwest, it has been defeated and there is no possibility of taking the offensive for the time being. In the southwest, although there are still disturbances everywhere, especially the threat to the Siyi area, there is no active attempt to move it to the main battlefield. As for the North Ping electric transmission on the 28th, the Japanese spokesperson said that 25,000 new soldiers will continue to be added to the war in North China, the purpose of which is probably to deal with our operations behind enemy lines.</p>
<p>In order to break the military plans of the Japanese, increase the difficulties of the Japanese army, stop the Japanese army's offensive, and boost the morale of our army, we began a counter-offensive on various battlefields two weeks ago. This counter-offensive is going quite smoothly. There have been significant victories in North China, Central China, and South China. It has not only greatly boosted the morale of the people in the rampant activities of traitors such as Wang Jingwei, but also greatly improved the combat effectiveness of our army and greatly improved our country's international status. The Japanese military plan, especially the new offensive plan, has been severely hit and frustrated.</p>
<p>In the past week, we have still maintained an active and advantageous position, and the counter-offensive on various battlefields has made new progress. What is particularly important is that our army has repeatedly counter-attacked and rushed into Nanchang. On the afternoon of the 27th, our army rushed into Nanchang for the third time and launched fierce street fighting. At the same time, our follow-up troops also arrived in the suburbs, converging from inside and outside, and encircling and annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. This victory not only broke the propaganda of the Japanese and traitors such as Wang Jingwei that "the Japanese army has not been defeated and is still invincible", but also stopped the Japanese army's offensive against northern Hunan, which has significant political and military significance. And the valiant fighting of our army and the improvement of the combat effectiveness of our army have deepened the understanding of people all over the world. In addition, our army threatens cities such as Beijing and Jinan in North China; on the Longhai Railway, it re-entered Kaifeng on the 20th and surrounded Xuzhou since the 22nd; on the eastern battlefield, it once entered Hangzhou on the 7th and fought street battles with the Japanese army for several hours; in South China, it continues to threaten the suburbs of Guangzhou. In other areas, such as southeastern Jin, our army recently annihilated more than 10,000 Japanese troops (Central News Agency, Tongguan, 28th), and our air force also showed great power and was active on various battlefields for several consecutive days, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. This is completely different from the past, when only our side was bombed.</p>
<p>At present, we have made strict arrangements in northern Hunan, the future center of the war. Commander-in-Chief Chiang decided to concurrently serve as the Supreme Commander of the Central China Region, personally directing the armies of the X, X, and X war zones to stop the Japanese army's offensive. A temporary headquarters has also been set up in a certain place in Hunan Province. The defense arrangements in the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi areas for three months have now been fully completed. The fortifications in the Hengyang, Changsha, and Zhuzhou areas are particularly strong. Secondly, there are also important deployments along the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. (1) The combat effectiveness of the New Fourth Army on the borders of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian is growing day by day. (2) In the past, there were many rumors about the war preparation in Fujian Province, but recently, after Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong of the X War Zone and Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Headquarters went to Fuzhou in person, although they "brought the bombing of Japanese planes", they swept away the "atmosphere of peace" and quickly prepared to resist Japan, which may be able to avoid danger. In addition, the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou is quite urgent. Although General Hua Zhenzhong is leading with all his strength and preparing for the war of resistance, it is hoped that the government will pay attention to the strengthening of the front-line combat effectiveness and the reform of political institutions in that area, and the development of mobilization work. Chaozhou and Shantou are important strongholds in the War of Resistance in South China and Southeast China. They are also currently the key to the sea outlet from Chongqing, Guilin, Hunan, and Shaoguan in the west. We must do our best to defend them!</p>
<p>Please refer to the attached picture (placed on page 3)</p>
<p>What is the Future of China?</p>
<p>Whether from the domestic and international situation or the War of Resistance situation, the future of China is bright! Especially after Commander-in-Chief Chiang published a statement last week, announcing that Wang Jingwei and his accomplices were traitors to the country by colluding with the enemy, and announcing that Wang Jingwei and his like had been sentenced to death in spirit, "the future of China is bright" has become a common sense for every Chinese and international public opinion.</p>
<p>Soviet newspapers were the first to publish the full text of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's speech, expressing great satisfaction, and believing that the Chinese supreme leader's determination to fight the War of Resistance to the end is also the expression of the determination of the entire Chinese people. The Soviet Union's movement to sympathize with and assist China has unfolded more enthusiastically.</p>
<p>British public opinion also unanimously praised our heroic War of Resistance. On the 22nd, the British Manchester Guardian also commented, praising: "Observers with clear minds and far-sightedness all believe that a new and powerful culture that has a significant impact on the youth of the world is now developing in the Far East. The source of this new culture is the active development of its Far East territories such as Siberia by Soviet Russia and the decision of the Chinese government to develop the western provinces." The newspaper also said that "China is fighting the War of Resistance independently without any signs of defeat. China's contribution to peace-loving countries is no less great than the disarmament of the United Kingdom or the peace proposals of President Roosevelt."</p>
<p>In politics, there is the plan expressed by Commander-in-Chief Chiang in his interview with the Dagongbao reporter on the 25th regarding the reform of lower-level administrative institutions and the establishment of the foundation of democratic politics. In economy, there is the importance of emphasizing the land policy of the Three People's Principles in wartime in Commander-in-Chief Chiang's speech to the Land Administration Society on the 22nd. In diplomacy, there is the telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Madame Chiang on the 24th congratulating the Pacific Northwest Conference for urging the embargo on munitions to Japan, and Ambassador Guo Taiqi's appeal in Europe to the great powers to expand the anti-aggression front to the Far East. In the construction of the west, there is the active promotion of the Western Sichuan reclamation plan and the enthusiastic support of the border people for the construction of the new Western Sichuan. In the military, there has been greater progress in the construction of the new air force movement, and there are also news of large purchases of aircraft materials. All these news this week are enough to make people excited and dance.</p>
<p>However, this progress and efforts of ours are obviously far from meeting the needs of the objective situation. Whether in politics, economy, diplomacy, front-line military affairs, or rear construction, we have not yet reached the necessary degree to end the transitional period of the War of Resistance, overcome the difficulties of the stalemate stage, and prepare to advance the general counter-offensive; on the contrary, the enemy and traitors' conspiracies of sowing discord, spreading rumors, and framing, especially the activities of "anti-communism" and "peace", are being promoted in various ways that are difficult to prevent! The recent news of the extension of the recess of the National Political Council and the failure of the lists of provincial senators to fully reflect the democratic spirit and cooperation between the parties is not only inconsistent with the intentions of the supreme leader and the national policy of the central government, but will also give the enemy and traitors a chance to spread rumors! We hope that the government will make quick and appropriate remedies, and that the necessary degree of improvement in the people's lives and the promotion of the wartime democratic spirit are the prerequisites for overcoming difficulties and winning victory. They must be turned from resolutions, declarations, texts, and outlines into facts in order to achieve the practical effect of mobilizing the whole people and ensuring victory, and to live up to the high expectations of all countries in the world for us!</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Gan, Hubei, and Hunan Provinces are Under Our Control; The Enemy Has New Designs on the Provinces of Shanxi and Henan; Sugiyama Holds a Military Conference in Xinxiang <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 29th) Fierce battles between our forces and the enemy continue several miles outside Nanchang. The enemy reinforcements are putting up stubborn resistance, so the struggle is particularly intense. After the enemy invasion of Heshan in southern Guangdong, we reinforced our forces and attacked, and the situation has stabilized. The mountains of Heshan, Gaoming, Kaiping, and other places are steep, making it difficult for the enemy to advance. We continue to fight the enemy in the areas between. After the enemy invasion of southern Shandong was repelled, we took advantage of the momentum to push forward, already approaching the Jinpu Railway Line, constantly launching attacks on the enemy. Our guerrillas are also extremely active in the Xuzhou-Lianyungang area, and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has been cut off by us.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our Chongqing office, 28th] Although the enemy is busy shifting forces on various battlefields, there has been no significant increase in troop numbers. Most of their supplemental soldiers are Taiwanese, Korean, Mongolian, and puppet troops. The total number of enemy troops in China is still less than one million. Their morale is declining, so even if they launch another major offensive, there is nothing to fear. Our troops in Gan (Jiangxi) have attacked and reached Qingyunpu, a scenic area in the southern suburbs of Nanchang, and are advancing towards the county seat. Wuning is only four or five miles from the city, and Fengxin is a little more than ten miles from the city.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 28th] In southwestern Shanxi, the enemy has retreated to various transportation hubs to put up stubborn resistance, and we are still attacking. General Sugiyama, commander of the enemy's North China Dispatch Army, arrived in Xinxiang by plane on the 22nd to inspect and hold a meeting, and returned to Beiping on the 23rd, seemingly with new designs on Henan and Shanxi. The commander of the enemy's 21st Division, Shiozu, is in Kaifeng, where there are currently more than 4,000 enemy troops. From the 23rd to the 27th, we attacked the western gate and railway station of Kaifeng every night, achieving many victories. The enemy's invasion of Changying resulted in the massacre of over a thousand civilians, and the burning of eight out of ten houses in the village. They have now been repelled by us.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi and Southern Hubei</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Guilin office, 29th] With the defense of Changsha as our operational objective, we simultaneously launched offensives in Jiangxi and Hubei, launching fierce attacks on the enemy who had not yet established a firm foothold. Currently, the following routes are seeing rapid progress by our forces: (1) The main force of our army attacking Nanchang is still engaged in fierce battles with the enemy north of Xiebu and Liantang. Our advance plainclothes troops reached the suburbs of the city on the 18th, surrounding Nanchang on three sides. The enemy transferred several thousand troops from the Nanxun Road, attempting to make a desperate stand behind the city. (2) The troops on the west bank of the Gan River, after recovering Gaoan and Dacheng, engaged in fierce battles with the enemy at Wanshou Palace on the afternoon of the 27th, and then advanced to Shengmi Street. On the 28th, they advanced again to the vicinity of Niuhang. The enemy transferred about a thousand troops from Nanchang, bypassing Shengmi Street and attacking Gaoan City, attempting to attack our flanks. We are currently blocking them. (3) A certain unit west of Fengxin once attacked Fengxin and engaged in street fighting with the enemy, then retreated to a certain place in the northwest. This route of our army was originally intended to be used for an imperial system, causing the enemy to tie up a portion of their forces in that area, unable to rescue Nanchang. (4) Our army, having recovered Tongshan, is advancing towards Chongyang. In the Battle of Baichang Bridge, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Chongyang. We are currently pursuing them. Although the enemy in Yueyang has increased by several thousand troops, due to the setbacks in southern Hubei, they are in grave danger, and are therefore extremely panicked. Considering the overall situation, the enemy's attempt to attack Changsha has not only completely failed, but is now completely under our control, and they are paying the price.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 28th] This afternoon, an enemy plane flew low over Gaoan to reconnoiter, and was hit by our anti-aircraft machine guns and crashed in the suburbs of Gaoan. We are currently searching for it.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Associated Press, Chongqing, 29th] According to Chinese sources, Chinese guerrillas attacked Nanchang, breaking through the Japanese army's outer defenses. The flanks enveloped the Japanese army from the east and west. The vanguard of the Chinese army entered the city and engaged in fierce street fighting for several hours. According to the latest reports from the Chinese side, the Chinese army is still firmly holding the Japanese army's positions outside Nanchang. The left wing of the Chinese army has captured Jiaji, Xincunxu, Wuliuji, and other places. The right wing of the Chinese army crossed the Wu River and counterattacked Zhongheyi, Fulunji, and the Nanchang Japanese army airport, with considerable success. Two thousand Japanese troops are currently extending along the Gan River to reinforce, attempting to break through the Chinese army and suppress the flanks of the Chinese army. They were defeated by the Chinese army south of Nanchang. The fierce fighting in the suburbs of Nanchang is extremely intense, and the Chinese army has forced the Japanese army to retreat into the city to defend. A authoritative military official told an Associated Press reporter that it is currently difficult to speculate when the Chinese army will be able to recover Nanchang, because the strength of the Japanese army coming from Jiujiang to reinforce has not yet been ascertained. The Chinese army's counterattack is not intended to recover Chang, because Nanchang is only the capital of a province and has little to do with the Chinese strategy. The true value of the Chinese army's counterattack lies in shattering the Japanese army's attempt to attack Changsha, and at the same time proving the rumors that the Chinese side is preparing to make peace are untrue. This counterattack has announced to the world that China will continue to resist to the end without compromise. At the same time, Chinese sources also stated that the Chinese army is currently surrounding Fengxin to contain the Japanese army and prevent them from providing reinforcements. The Japanese army in Songbu once attacked the Tianjin line of the Chinese army and was immediately severely damaged by the Chinese army. The Chinese army also attacked Taru and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese garrison for several hours before retreating. The Japanese army in Wuning is actively building defensive works to hold firmly. Yesterday, 500 Japanese troops, supported by 12 tanks and 3 aircraft, attacked the Chinese army's front line near Wuning from Ruoxi, and were repelled by the Chinese army. Fierce fighting resumed today, and was still ongoing at the time of dispatch.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 28th] Our troops attacking Nanchang from the southeast of the Gan River are making unusually rapid progress. A certain mobile unit of our forces, after recovering Wuduanxu and Dafota, advanced rapidly to the northwest, and on the evening of the 28th, crossed the railway line, bypassed Liantang and Xiangtang, cutting off the enemy's rear in Liantang and Xiangtang, and trapping them in a four-sided encirclement.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 29th] After our recovery of Shengmi Street, we have continued to make progress and are advancing north. The enemy in Wanshou Palace, although supported by reinforcements at one point, barely managed to hold on, but after our repeated encirclements, the time of their collapse is not far away.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, East 29th] The enemy's two strongholds of Liantang and Xiangtang are under heavy siege by our forces. On the 29th, more than a thousand enemy troops marched south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to reinforce, attempting to save Nanchang from its perilous situation. This reinforcement of enemy troops is also under our siege.</p>
<p>Southeastern Shanxi Province</p>
<p>[Dispatch from a certain place in southern Shanxi, 27th] In order to end the mop-up operation in North China, after invading central Hebei, southern Hebei, and southern Shanxi, the enemy then invaded southeastern Shanxi, attempting to attack our base areas. They launched fierce attacks simultaneously on three routes, northwest, south, and south, first occupying Fushan and Anze, then capturing Wanghe and Dajiang (south of Tianjingguan in Jincheng). The northern route was particularly fierce. The enemy, with a force of one division, personally commanded by Division Commander Anan, occupied Wanghe on the 3rd and then advanced eastward, attacking various important places south of our Fen Shui Ling (Watershed Ridge). On the 11th, they moved towards Gucheng, intending to threaten our Wuxiang and Yushe. To the north, they directly drafted Zihongkou in five routes from Huima Wangjiapo and the valley entrance. A certain unit of our forces was surrounded. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the unit fought bravely, using the strategy of fighting from the inner line to the outer line, and fought fiercely for six days and nights, managing to break through the encirclement in the evening. At the same time, a certain unit of our forces also dispatched troops north to Taigu, causing the enemy to rush around without rest. They have now retreated step by step. Gucheng, Fen Shui Ling, Wangtao and other places are free of enemy traces. They are stubbornly resisting in the three strongholds of Wanghe Nanguan Zihong.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xi'an, 28th] Military news, on the 17th, over two hundred enemy troops and four artillery pieces from Xikaikou (north of Hejin) advanced towards our positions on three routes. They fought fiercely with us until evening, and routed the enemy on the two routes of Lao Junguan and Eighty Turns. The other route is currently confronting us.</p>

<h3 id="e6">A Great Victory in the Air Battle over Hanzhong; Our Planes Sortie to Southern Shanxi to Assist in the Battle; Three Accomplishments in One Day <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 29th] Amidst the fierce battles in southern Shanxi, our brave air force once again came out to assist in the battle this morning, demonstrating their great prowess. A total of our aircraft sorties to the Zhongtiao Mountain area at 8:00 AM this morning to cooperate with our army in attacking the enemy, achieving remarkable results. They then flew over the city of Yuncheng and the airfield occupied by the enemy in the suburbs of the city, dropping many bombs, with nineteen hits. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses, and the details are being investigated. After our air force accomplished their mission, they flew back to their original defense. At around 10:00 AM, they encountered seven enemy aircraft bombing Hanzhong near Hanzhong. Meeting on a narrow road, we met the enemy with planes and launched a fierce air battle. Our air force's superb technology, despite the enemy's aircraft outnumbering ours, still resulted in one enemy aircraft being shot down. The remaining enemy aircraft fled in panic. The wreckage of the aircraft we shot down is being searched for. According to our air force, one sortie has resulted in three achievements, and their heroic spirit is truly admirable.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, ××, 29th] At 7:45 AM, seven enemy aircraft invaded the airspace over Xi'an. Our aircraft immediately went to intercept them. At 8:30 AM, we encountered our aircraft in the airspace over Nanzheng. We bravely attacked and, after a fierce battle, shot down two enemy aircraft, which both fell in the area east of Nanzheng. One of our aircraft was slightly damaged and forced to land, but the pilot was unharmed. The rest returned to their defense safely. According to the Anti-Aircraft Command, seven enemy aircraft came, and five returned, and their formation was in disarray. It is now confirmed that an enemy Type 97 fighter plane crashed south of Lantian at Jin Gong Temple with the plane destroyed and the pilot killed. Investigation shows that during the air battle of Nanzheng, its fuel tank was hit by us, causing excessive leakage, and it crashed midway. Another aircraft is still under investigation. Also, at 7:30 AM today, a certain unit of our elite aircraft bombed the enemy's advanced headquarters and air force base in Yuncheng with pouring bombs, hitting the target. The enemy suffered significant losses. Our aircraft completed their mission and returned safely side by side. According to our air combat personnel, the number of aircraft parked at Yuncheng Airport is less than before. This is clear evidence that our attacking troops are near the suburbs of Yuncheng.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Shantou, 27th] At 6:00 AM on the 27th, five enemy warships suddenly appeared at the mouth of the Shantou Ma Gorge and fired several shells at Hedu Gate in Chaoyang. They also sent armed ships to reconnoiter the coast around Shantou and Chaozhou. Up until 12:00 PM, enemy aircraft took off three times from the enemy warships there, attacking Chenghai, Shantou, and Chaoan. They heavily bombed Shanwu Bridge in Shantou, dropping twelve bombs, destroying more than ten civilian houses and injuring more than ten civilians. The enemy warships are still hovering in the waters off Shantou and have not left.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 29th] On the morning of the 27th, a unit of enemy cavalry attacked Zhuliuhe, about 20 kilometers north of Heshan City. We fired calmly, killing more than ten enemy soldiers. The enemy then fled in defeat.</p>
<h3 id="e8">British Press Observes the Overall Situation in the Far East; British Attitude Remains Extremely Active; Enemy Morale in a Steep Decline <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 29th] The local newspapers today are paying unanimous attention to the recent fierce debate within Japan regarding the issue of turning the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. The majority opinion is that, despite frequent pressure from Germany, it will still be difficult to conclude a military alliance. Hitler's speech did not mention Japan's willingness to participate. Some newspapers believe that Japan is willing to conclude a military alliance with Germany at most to resist the Soviet Union. This observation is completely in line with what well-informed Japanese sources in London told Reuters reporters. They said that Japan would only be willing to get involved in the European war if it was attacked by the Soviet Union. The information obtained by these Japanese claimed that the Japanese Navy Ministry opposed the alliance proposal most strongly, believing that it was completely inconsistent with traditional policies. President Roosevelt's peace proposals to the dictators and the simultaneous dispatch of the British fleet back to the Pacific undoubtedly surprised Japan and made it dare not resist Britain. Political figures also agreed with the observation that it is difficult for Japan to conclude an alliance with Germany. Japan's recent attitude towards Britain has obviously eased greatly compared to before. The fierce and threatening anti-British attitude of a year ago has now subsided greatly. They are now willing to listen carefully to Britain's protests and notes. It would be a supreme mistake to assume that Europe's busy affairs have made Britain forget its interests in the Far East. According to what Reuters has learned, the opposite is true. The methods and scope adopted will depend on the progress of events. The "Financial Times" published a lengthy commentary, stating that Japan's attempts to forcibly exchange currencies and import controls in North China "have almost completely failed." The reason why commerce in North China has not been completely interrupted is entirely because the Japanese side either knows the importance of this issue or is unable to enforce all of its new regulations. Close attention is also being paid here to the Chinese army's major counteroffensive, believing that China has indeed achieved a great deal of success. Military observers told Reuters reporters that, regardless of whether the Chinese army's current counteroffensive to recover Nanchang and Guangzhou is a wise move, the impact on morale is enormous. This is enough to make Japan fall into a steep decline and prevent them from making any further progress. Although the air of peace is still frequently seen, the fact is that there is no room for compromise among the combatants.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Associated Press, Chongqing, 29th] Local financial figures stated that the Chinese government is currently working to adopt effective measures to control imports into China. The method will mainly focus on our customs and the management of foreign exchange. The Chinese government is currently concerned about the excessive number of imported goods, especially luxury goods. Therefore, it has ordered the customs to restrict the import of such goods, and the purchase of foreign exchange will only be approved if the goods are absolutely necessary. This policy is fully in line with the government's aim of stabilizing foreign prices. At the same time, the Chinese government is also planning to increase foreign trade in order to obtain foreign exchange.</p>
<h3 id="e13">On the Northwest Shanxi Battlefield with the慰勞Inspection Team (Part 1) <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>—Ji Chang</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Min Ge She, Northwest Shanxi] Last October, when the enemy once again launched an offensive in Northwest Shanxi, and occupied Xinling in Ningwu Shenchi and other counties, the front line慰勞 inspection team composed of various agencies and organizations in the Second Administrative Region of Shanxi, set out from Kelan under extremely tense battle conditions, embarking on their journey. In the icy and snowy Northwest Shanxi, they trekked for over a thousand miles, reaching the true front line of national defense, spending over fifty days, and returning to Kelan fully loaded with valuable gains and victorious achievements, which was completely unexpected for them.</p>
<p>The sixteen members of the 慰勞 inspection team, in order to be able to conduct guerrilla warfare when necessary, equipped themselves with weapons. Kelan was under constant alert threats when they set out. Most of the residents in the city had already completed the "clearing the houses" work. On the way to the front line, they only saw retreating residents and the families of some troops, but did not see people returning. The news from the front line was sometimes bizarre and terrifying, but in order to complete the sacred mission, they were still rushing forward. Because most of the troops in front were stationed in the mountains, they had to take mountain paths. On the snow-covered mountain roads, they climbed, jumped, and advanced bumpily. Sometimes they walked in thick snow, exposing only the upper half of their bodies; sometimes, because they could not find the path, they wrapped their heads in leather jackets when going downhill and slid down. One day, they only walked thirty miles from morning to night, which shows how difficult the journey was. But it was precisely on these "high hills" that our guerrillas were active.</p>
<p>The footprints of the 慰勞 inspection team crossed the borders of six counties and慰勞ed more than twenty units of troops. Their 慰勞 work methods were: (1) Talking with all the soldiers, (2) Holding a joint military-political gala, (3) Singing and performing art, (4) Presenting national flags. When they talked with the soldiers, the soldiers were all encouraged and grateful, and shouted slogans. At the joint military-political gala, all levels of the entire group could raise some meaningful questions and valuable suggestions. For example, when they were慰勞ing a certain guerrilla troop, it coincided with the double "Twelve" anniversary, so they discussed the meaning of the double "Twelve" incident. Although opinions differed slightly at first, after discussion, they unanimously believed that the double "Twelve" incident objectively determined domestic unity and laid the foundation for the united front.</p>

<h3 id="e14">How Xie Stole the Enemy's Military Mail: Account by Sergeant Wang Shulin <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Notes by Zhang Changren</p>
<p>When I was in Changsha, I heard that Sergeant Wang Shulin of the ×th Division of our army in northern Hunan had penetrated the enemy's lines and returned with a large amount of the enemy's military mail. Therefore, on April 2nd, I departed from Changsha to inspect the front lines in northern Hunan, intending to visit the soldier's unit's location for an interview. Upon arriving in Miluo, I learned that the unit was guarding the front lines on both banks of the Xinqiang River. On April 10th, I reached the division headquarters near the Xinqiang River, but he had just been ordered to set off for Yueyang to scout the enemy situation. I missed him. It was not until April 16th that I finally met him in ××× south of Miluo Jiang, as he had already completed his mission and safely returned with enemy documents and books.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang has delicate features and a moderate build. He was wearing a black short shirt and trousers, and he answered the reporter's questions with sincerity and clarity, and was very humble. However, his demeanor and bearing immediately revealed that he had received military training for many years. After completing his report, he still deeply regretted that while he had the desire to serve the country, his education was insufficient. I happened to have the book "Japanese Spies" with me on my journey, so I gave it to him, hoping it would slightly increase his knowledge of espionage.</p>
<p>According to the Chief of Staff of the ×th Division, Mr. Wang is very courageous and ambitious. Each time he goes on a mission, he always tries to achieve more than the original task. When he detects any counter-espionage activity in his espionage operations, he will eliminate it with all his might. He is truly a genius spy. - A note by Changren</p>
<p>My name is Wang Shu; I am from ×××, Yueyang. I am twenty-three years old this year. My father has passed away, and my mother is over sixty years old. She and my elder brothers and sisters-in-law are still farming in ×××, barely managing to make a living.</p>
<p>At the age of fourteen, I graduated from a small school in my hometown and joined the Yueyang County Government Security Team as a messenger. A year later, I became a formal member of the security team. At the age of seventeen, I felt that the security team had limited prospects, so I was introduced by a friend to Nanjing to join the machine gun battalion of the Garrison Headquarters. In December 1937, the machine gun battalion was placed under the command of the 51st Division of the Army. On December 13th, I was wounded in action near Yuhuatai outside the capital of Nanjing. I was treated in wounded soldier hospitals in Huanggang and Wuchang, Hubei. At the end of January last year, I returned to my home in Yueyang to recover from my injuries. By March, I had fully recovered. I saw that the country had reached this point, and there was no better thing for a young person to do than to join the army, so I joined the Yueyang Regular Army again. In November last year, the ×th Division was fighting in the Xinqiang area, and because I was a local, I was recruited as a plainclothes soldier with the rank of private first class.</p>
<p>For the past five months, my comrades in the plainclothes team and I have often entered the enemy's rear in the Yueyang area to scout the enemy situation. I have been arrested four times, but I have escaped each time. The incident of me stealing the enemy's military mail was an opportunity I stumbled upon after my first arrest.</p>
<p>It was on January 9th when I was ordered to set out from the guerrilla camp near Yuan Shaozhong Village to scout near Yunxi Station, about thirty to forty li from Yueyang. I disguised myself as a farmer in Pingdi Li Village, carrying a load of sweet potatoes northward into the enemy's security line. I had previously obtained a so-called "Good Citizen Certificate." (It was four inches long and two and a half inches wide. The words "Identity Certificate" were written horizontally on top, followed by "Name," "Address," "Occupation," and "Age." Below was the signature of the "××× Autonomous Committee." In addition to the committee's seal, there was a small circular stamp with "Naito" on the corner of the cloth.) Because the enemy wanted to lure the people back to their hometowns, they let me pass when they saw this cloth strip. In the area between the front lines of our two armies, there were more than ten li where the common people were still farming. The enemy's general fortifications were not much different from ours, but the strongholds were mostly constructed with reinforced concrete, and there were two or three layers of wire mesh outside. They could only be destroyed with artillery. They were well concealed, and sometimes it was difficult to detect them even up close.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Yunxi Station, I was surrounded by a dozen Japanese soldiers. At first, they ate my sweet potatoes casually. Finally, a military policeman came and tried to persuade me to become a puppet soldier, and forced me to walk with him with a gun. The streets of Yunxi are close to the railway station. After walking not far, we turned into a city house. The house was also surrounded by barbed wire. As I walked in, I paid attention to finding a way out. It was a row of three rooms. He led me into the middle one and locked the door.</p>
<p>There were already five or six farmers in their twenties and thirties in the room, sitting on the hay, both angry and scared. Although they didn't know me, they expressed sympathy for my misfortune. Looking at the lattice windows, they didn't seem very strong. I thought that escaping might be the only way.</p>
<p>I went in at around 3 PM. After 5 PM, another military policeman suddenly opened the door and ordered me to come out. He gestured for me to sweep the house for them. I gladly picked up a dustpan and broom. There was a sign reading "Great Japan Post Office" hanging on the door of the room on the left. I peeked in through the window and saw that the narrow, long table by the window was piled with many letters and paper rolls. I guessed it was the military post office. The room on the right was the kitchen. I caught a glimpse of a shiny kitchen knife on the chopping block, seven or eight inches long and two inches wide, looking somewhat like a butcher knife. I swept the floor. Taking advantage of the Japanese soldier's unpreparedness, I grabbed it and hid it in my coat, then he locked me back in the middle room and gave me a small tube of steamed rice with a small piece of rather fishy salted fish on top.</p>
<p>I silently hid the knife in the hay without anyone in the room knowing. Then, I sat near the wall, watching the sky outside the window gradually darken, listening to the sounds of the Japanese soldiers' leather shoes and horses' hooves. With my hands behind my back, I dug a small hole in the ground with the knife and buried the knife inside. When it was dark, the people in the room all fell asleep on the hay. Listening outside, the number of people walking had also decreased. I took out the knife in the dark and slowly began to cut the window bars. It took me more than two hours to remove three of them, enough for one person to squeeze through.</p>
<p>It was about 11 PM. ××××× was snoring loudly. I jumped out of the window, determined to steal the military mail before escaping. I walked to the window of the "Post Office", pushed it, but it was locked inside. Using the knife, it didn't move. The two large packages of mail on the table were tempting me in the dim light. I gently broke the glass first, then reached in and opened the window. I grabbed a package, but I don't know if it was because I was panicking or because the narrow table was not stable, but it fell to the ground with a "boom." At that point, I could only "take the best of the thirty-six strategies, which is to leave." I immediately dashed out of the house, crossed the barbed wire short fence, and ran wildly into the darkness to the southwest. The Japanese military police chased after me. A gunshot rang out, and the Japanese soldiers hiding in the fortifications also blindly fired into the darkness like the saying "one dog barks at a shadow, and a hundred dogs bark." After running three or four li, the enemy bullets were still whistling over my head. At this time, I felt that carrying the items was too heavy—each package of mail weighed about eight or nine pounds—and would definitely not be fast, so I decided to reluctantly abandon one package. After walking another six or seven li, the dense gunfire faded far behind.</p>
<p>So I rested in a small pine forest on a small hill, and then slowly carried the package of mail back.</p>
<p>At dawn, I had to cross the new highway that the Japanese had built south of Yueyang. I saw six or seven sentries walking towards me half a mile away. I crossed it as if nothing had happened. By the time they noticed me and shouted at me to stop, I had already entered the woods on the side of the road. They chased for a while, but in the end, they did not dare to chase into the woods.</p>
<p>Two days later, I returned to the division headquarters, presented my spoils, and reported the situation in detail. That package of mail was wrapped in Japanese reeds. Inside, there were more than four hundred letters and dozens of rolls of newspapers and magazines. It was immediately forwarded to the higher-level military headquarters. Later, I learned that there were many materials inside for us to use as reference. There was also fresh evidence of the enemy soldiers' war-weariness. Among them was a list of the names of enemy soldiers who were wounded in action with us in Nansuzhou. In one battalion (Note by the reporter: A Japanese battalion consists of four companies, each with more than two hundred and ten people. There are more than seventy light and heavy machine guns, with stronger firepower than our regiment), the number of wounded reached one hundred and fifty, not including those who died. I also saw the "Wuhan Daily" published by the enemy for the first time.</p>
<p>The division commander awarded me twenty yuan at the time. A few days later, the army headquarters and the army corps headquarters also awarded me one hundred yuan each. They also promoted me from private first class to sergeant. I am really very grateful. However, rewards and promotions are not the purpose of my work. I only regret that I have not studied enough and cannot help the country more.</p>
<p>When I was in Yueyang, I often met the commander of the Ritsuda Regiment, riding a warhorse alone, carrying a pistol, to the house of our female compatriots that he had forcibly occupied. I really wanted to find a way to take a gun and finish him off. But for the greater purpose, I have not yet received the order to do so. (April 27, on both sides of Miluo.)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Tensions Rise in Eastern Europe: Germany Revokes Treaties and Threatens Poland, Britain Steps Up Defense Preparations <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Reuter Berlin, 28th] The German envoys in Britain and Poland today presented memorandums to the British and Polish governments respectively, revoking the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish non-aggression pact. The memorandum to Britain recalls Chamberlain's statement from Munich, that "Chamberlain and Hitler both regard the agreement as an expression of the hope of Germany and Britain never to wage war against each other." The document added that Germany regrets that Britain's policy of reconciliation with Germany has been increasingly distant recently. Although the Anglo-German Naval Agreement has been abolished, Germany hopes that this move will not affect the qualitative rules of the navy, so as to avoid unlimited naval building by various countries. The document revoking the German-Polish treaty states that Poland's agreement with Britain clearly contradicts the solemn declaration made when the German-Polish treaty was signed a few months ago. The German government is only surprised by the sudden change in Poland's policy. The Anglo-Polish agreement is a direct action against Germany, and is also a direct opposition to the declaration of 1934, which mutually agreed to oppose the use of force. Poland has expressed its willingness to abandon the peace guarantee given by the German government and accept the promise of assistance from a third country, which is to endorse the policy of encircling Germany. In fact, Poland has implicitly revoked the declaration of 1934, but Germany is unwilling to abandon its original intention of German-Polish reconciliation. If Poland does not forget the old friendship, Germany still wants to conclude a new treaty with Poland under the condition of providing each other with clear covenants.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London, 29th] After Hitler's speech, Britain has stepped up its defense preparations as a response to Hitler. Many men in various military departments in Britain have automatically enlisted. Former Foreign Minister Eden has also enlisted. Hitler's announcement of the abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is regarded here as a political bluff. However, Hitler's abolition of the German-Polish agreement is considered a serious move. It is expected that Germany will infringe on Polish interests and incite Britain and France to implement their guarantee of aid to Poland. Also, diplomatic circles here believe that Hitler's announcement of the abolition of the German-Polish agreement will force Poland to re-edit its foreign policy and closely cooperate with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuter Berlin, 28th] Although the newspapers here enthusiastically welcomed Hitler's speech, foreign political circles have frankly expressed pessimism. A diplomat told a Reuter reporter that the question now is no longer whether war will occur, but when war will occur. The general interpretation of Hitler's speech is that although Hitler knows that the fate of Europe depends on how he resolves the Danzig issue, he is still determined to follow his own path to resolve it. Most people are now comparing Hitler's anti-Polish methods to his methods of destroying Czechoslovakia. If the two are parallel, it is believed that his second step will be to make broader and more forceful demands on Poland.</p>
<p>[Reuter Warsaw, 29th] The authorities here have not criticized Hitler's announcement of the abandonment of the German-Polish treaty, but Hitler's abandonment of the treaty was expected, so it is not surprising. According to reports here, Poland's national policy is based on its own strength, not relying on the guarantee of treaties. The government newspaper "Polish Express" stated that Danzig must maintain its current state, and Poland will never allow any other nation to usurp its rights and sovereignty in Danzig. The newspaper said, "The only point that can be revised is the abolition of the League of Nations' power," meaning that Poland is prepared to jointly establish a German-Polish joint management agency to replace the current domination of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>[Reuter Berlin, 28th] In addition to the 888 members of the German Parliament, Hitler's speech also reached countless listeners around the world via radio. Hitler's reply to President Roosevelt's suggestion was expected and did not cause surprise, because everyone expected Hitler would never accept President Roosevelt's suggestion and would explain the reasons for his refusal. General observation: Following Hitler's speech, German newspapers will launch a fierce attack on Poland. In the past few days, newspapers have repeatedly published news of "Germans being abused in Poland." Political circles explain Hitler's statement that Germany is willing to provide guarantees to any country that needs them should not be regarded as accepting President Roosevelt's suggestion. This guarantee only involves Germany and the guaranteed country, so in the event of a breach of contract, it has nothing to do with third countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Danzig Free City, 28th] In the speech delivered by Hitler today, there was a section involving Danzig. National Socialist Party members all expect that the city will be merged into Germany on May 1st. The police here have temporarily canceled their holidays, and the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers have also been ordered to come.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Lithuanian Capital, 29th] According to observations in Lithuania, the current situation has not eased due to Hitler's speech, because the tense situation between Germany and Poland may engulf Eastern Europe in a vortex.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Berlin, 29th] Hitler's speech yesterday lasted two and a half hours, with a very slow pronunciation, and accompanied by various gestures. The two main points were attacking Britain and abandoning the German-Polish treaty. When Hitler read the names of more than 30 countries listed in President Roosevelt's telegram, the whole audience burst into laughter. When he mentioned Palestine, the auditorium was filled with laughter for half a minute.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Warsaw, 29th] Officials declared that they rejected any unilateral attempt to resolve the Polish-German issue through pressure, but Poland attached great importance to the points mentioned in Hitler's speech and the German note, and considered them to be a sign of goodwill. Although the Polish side strongly stated that the German side, not the Polish side, abandoned the Polish-German non-aggression pact, well-informed sources believe that the possibility of continued negotiations has not completely disappeared.</p>
<p>[Reuter Warsaw, 29th] The "Warsaw Daily" declared today that "Poland will never agree to Germany's proposals for Danzig and building roads in the Polish Corridor." The newspaper also stated that Poland had not received proposals regarding the 25-year non-aggression pact and guarantees for Slovakia.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Berlin, 28th] Hitler's speech has just been commented on by experienced observers. They all said that Poland is in the same situation as Czechoslovakia in 1938 and will become a sacrifice to Germany's eastward expansion policy. However, Hitler will go to his villa in Hudesladen after the celebration of National Labor Day on May 1st. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will also go to Hungary next month to return the visit. It can be seen that Germany may not take immediate action against Poland. As far as the German plan is concerned, it should start with propaganda to incite various ethnic minorities within Poland. This is no different from what was done to Czechoslovakia in the past. At the same time, it will also carry out diplomatic activities in Southeastern Europe, especially Romania, to isolate Poland. This plan takes a long time and is more difficult than dealing with Czechoslovakia before. This is also acknowledged by German political circles. Observers also said that Germany has long coveted the Ukrainian region and recently proposed to Poland to jointly invade it, but Poland refused to accept it because it feared that it would become a vassal of Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London, 28th] Before leaving for his weekend holiday, Chamberlain met with Foreign Minister Halifax for 45 minutes. It is reported that the two discussed Hiller's speech and the abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Reactions to Hitler's Speech from Various Countries: Britain and France Are Not Surprised, Balkan Countries to Hold a Meeting <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>England</p>
<p>[Reuter London, 8th] London is now carefully studying Hitler's speech. Officials are unwilling to express their opinions temporarily before studying it in detail. Regarding the abandonment of the naval agreement, it is believed here that since there is no exchange of information, maintaining the proportional rules is of little value. From a legal point of view, the unilateral declaration of the abandonment of the treaty is invalid. The German document stated regarding the declaration of abandonment of the naval agreement that the agreement was concluded on the principle that Britain would not interfere in Germany's policy in Europe. This concept is completely wrong, because the negotiation process never involved this matter. Britain strongly denies that British newspapers have been encouraged to adopt anti-German attitudes. Britain does not need to oppose all of Germany's future problems in Europe. Britain's actions are definitely not based on anti-Germanism, but are determined to oppose aggression. People generally believe that Germany should have invited Britain to discuss together before abandoning the agreement, instead of taking unilateral action. It is reported that Britain is ready to respond to Germany at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>[Reuter London, 29th] According to a Reuter naval reporter, Hitler's decision to abandon the Anglo-German Naval Agreement did not cause much surprise. Officials have not criticized it. However, according to those who pay attention to current affairs, the agreement has no major impact. Anyway, in terms of the current ratio, the German navy cannot catch up with Britain. If Germany wants to draft a large-scale naval construction project, its exhausted economy will inevitably feel more difficult. Moreover, the construction of giant ships cannot be completed overnight, so even if Germany implements the construction of additional warships, it can only focus on submarines.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>[Reuter Paris, 28th] The first reaction in Paris to Hitler's speech was "Hitler is still delaying." The content of the speech was not as rude as imagined. Hitler has repeatedly defended the reasons for forcibly annexing Czechoslovakia, which is indeed influenced by world public opinion. The firm attitude of Britain and France has led to the British conscription, but this is just the beginning of expressing the attitude of Britain and France. The abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is not surprising, because this move was expected. The cancellation of the German-Polish agreement proves that the key in the future is still Poland. At the same time, there is no reason to form the belief that the efforts of democratic countries to maintain peace have been discouraged.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 29th] French senior officials listened to Hitler's speech in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's residence yesterday. It is said that the speech was not as fierce in form as previous speeches. The two points of Hitler's announcement of the abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the Polish-German agreement are considered extremely serious. However, there is no direct attack on France in the speech. They expressed indignation at Hitler's attack on Britain and the United States. As for the attitude towards the entire speech, it is said that it can only be published after detailed study.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 29th] It is heard here that officials regard Hitler's speech as a cunning defense, which does not help the European crisis. The French Ministry of the Army has confirmed that the French-Polish alliance has been completed. Officials here are not surprised by Hitler's abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and said that Germany's naval power is difficult to surpass Britain and France. Germany may only be able to build more submarines.</p>
<p>Romania</p>
<p>[Reuter Romanian Capital, 28th] Germany's announcement of the abandonment of the German-Polish agreement is just enough to promote the cooperation and connection between Poland and Romania. It is reported that after Romanian Foreign Minister Fenco returns to the country, the Balkan Pact countries will hold another meeting in the Romanian capital to discuss the issue of Bulgaria's territorial demands. It is expected that the Balkan Pact countries will maintain their firm attitude towards the claim of territorial change as in the past. However, economic cooperation will be allowed for Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>[Reuter Rome, 29th] Caida published an article in the "Italian Daily" expressing extreme support for Hitler's speech, saying that "This shows that Germany and Italy will not passively be placed in a policy of being encircled."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 29th] "Italian People's News" declared today that Roosevelt is a foolish and speculative person. Hitler's rejection of his rogue and cunning suggestions has made the chaotic situation in Europe clear. The newspaper repeated Roosevelt as a "hippopotamus" and said that it hoped this lesson would be enough to make Roosevelt dare not interfere in other people's affairs again.</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo] The newspapers here published Hitler's speech in a prominent position and vigorously promoted it. "Asahi Shimbun" wrote an article criticizing that Britain, the United States, and France had attributed the responsibility for any war to Germany and Italy. Observing Hitler's speech this time, it can be proved that this is unfounded. Germany and Italy are now trying to avoid using this terrible method to complete their demands. However, Britain and France still hope to maintain the status quo, which will eventually lead to international war.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Italian Cabinet Passes Increased Military Spending, Air Force Reservists Ordered to Enlist, Italian-German Military Talks to Be Held <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Rome, 29th] According to official announcements, the Italian Prime Minister informed the cabinet of the resolutions on the meeting with the Army Director and the Minister of Finance in Locagadra Gamena, which were unanimously passed by the cabinet meeting on Sunday morning. It was decided to increase the strength of the Italian army, and it was also said that the military budget would also be added to meet the expenses of expanding armaments and national defense organizations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Rome, 29th] The Italian government has recently ordered all reserve pilots below the rank of captain in the air force to resume military service. This order will include those who have not been active in the aviation industry for three years and those who are over 45 years old and work on civil aircraft. It is reported that Mussolini is now considering cooperating with Germany to resist British conscription. This matter will be passed by the cabinet today. Mussolini will discuss everything with the German Chief of Staff on Sunday. The chairman of the German Aviation Association has arrived in Genoa.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] It is claimed here that government authorities have delivered a copy of Hitler's speech to the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Germany as a response to President Roosevelt's proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Some members of Congress have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the tone of Hitler's speech, describing it as ranting and grandstanding. Representative Bloom, acting chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, "Hitler talks grandly about world peace while simultaneously issuing a serious ultimatum to Poland." Senator Pittman believes Hitler has regarded his speech as "an act to terminate world peace negotiations."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Sources with inside knowledge say that Hitler's speech offers only a glimmer of hope to those full of illusions. Hitler's abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Treaty is the most appropriate standard for commenting on the full text of the speech. Hitler's response to President Roosevelt's peace telegram is sufficient to show that Hitler's concept of values ​​is contrary to the traditional concept of the West. Every person with Western thought, who would not be heartbroken? Although we cannot abandon all hope because of this, it is evident that the work of maintaining peace must rely on the full efforts of mankind.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hyde Park, NY, 28th] The President's press office has announced that Roosevelt was asleep when the German leader delivered his speech today and did not wake up until 8:20 a.m., when the speech had ended. This incident will not affect state affairs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] It is reported that President Roosevelt may respond to Hitler's speech during one of his domestic broadcasts.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] In Hitler's speech, he stated the following military supplies were obtained by Germany after the annexation of Czechoslovakia: 1,582 airplanes, hundreds of anti-aircraft guns, 2,175 artillery pieces, 469 tanks, 43,876 machine guns, 1,000,000 rifles, 1,000,000,000 bullets, 3,000,000 shells, and a lot of specialized motorcycles.

<p>[Reuters, New York, 28th] President Roosevelt will not mention Hitler's speech at all during his address at the opening ceremony of the World's Fair on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 28th] Although the White House does not acknowledge that Hitler's speech is a response to the United States, observers believe that when the President attends the opening of the New York World's Fair on the 30th, he may again denounce dictators for endangering peace in Europe.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 27th] It is reported that Britain will offer Germany a non-aggression guarantee as a response to Hitler's speech, expressing that Britain has no hostility towards Germany. After Britain takes the lead in proposing this, the 31 nations listed by Roosevelt will also participate. While these negotiations are underway, Britain will continue its efforts to conscript troops and organize a large European peace front as a guarantee for negotiations with Germany.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] According to sources with inside knowledge, the British Ambassador to Germany will meet with the German Foreign Minister in the coming days. One of the British proposals will be to guarantee Germany against foreign attack, in an attempt to ease British-German tensions. Political figures here say that given the current public debate in Britain, it is difficult to reopen negotiations with Germany, so British-German relations are unlikely to improve.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon gave a speech at the Royal Albert Hall last night, warning Germany to pay attention to the changes in British policy. Simon detailed Prime Minister Chamberlain's efforts to establish a friendly agreement in Europe and testified that Britain was not to blame if this agreement failed. Britain has now established new treaty obligations with Poland, Romania, and Greece, and what has caused Britain to change this policy is Germany's actions. The so-called German policy, that only Germans should be incorporated into Germany, is in fact incorrect. Recent events are very different from this. If the purpose of such actions is to dominate all of Europe, Britain will inevitably resist.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 29th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with the Soviet and U.S. ambassadors today. According to informed sources, the Soviet ambassador told the French Foreign Minister that if the Baltic countries encountered unprovoked aggression, the Soviet government was prepared to provide military assistance. He also said that the Soviet Union still supports a collective guarantee policy to maintain peace. The U.S. Ambassador, after hearing the results of the French Foreign Minister's talks with the Soviet ambassador, then stated Washington's attitude towards the German leader's speech. It is heard that Bonnet wanted to explore Foreign Minister Gafencu of Romania's views on accepting Soviet aid.</p>
<h3 id="e26">U.S. Government and Public Unanimously Advocate Economic Sanctions Against Japan; Embargo on Munitions, Restriction of Trade; Increased Wartime Loans to China <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Senators who support the government's tough diplomatic policy in the Far East are actively pursuing economic sanctions against Japan in Congress, while also seeking to protect U.S. agricultural exports to Japan. Congressional observers say that Pittman's proposal authorizes the President to prohibit the shipment of raw and processed sugar from the Philippines to Japan, but hemp, coconut, and rice, which are staple products, are not included in the prohibition. Pittman's proposal stipulates that the President shall not impose any restrictions on foreign importers who purchase American agricultural products.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] If Senator Pittman's proposal is passed, then an embargo and restrictions on U.S.-Japan trade will become a possible reality. At that time, President Roosevelt can make this bill effective through an executive order. This order will take effect ten days after being submitted to Congress, and Congress has no power to veto it. Pittman told reporters that this proposal is essential because the government can use it to lift the restrictions on overseas Chinese in China. In the two years since the war of Japanese aggression against China, the property and lives of overseas Chinese have been repeatedly endangered, their legal rights and interests have been repeatedly undermined, and the language of the Nine-Power Treaty has also been violated by Japan. The government has continuously protested to Japan because of this, but to no avail. The purpose of this proposal is also to authorize the President to assist in reaching an understanding with Japan." Senator Guffey today requested the Foreign Affairs Committee of Congress to pass this proposal so that the President has the power to implement an embargo on Japan and at the same time provide material assistance to countries that have been invaded. For example, "If we continue to supply munitions to the violators of the treaty, how is this different from supplying the enemy with food and strengthening the strength of our future enemies?" Mr. Chase, President of the World Peace Religion Joint Association, requested President Roosevelt to convene a meeting of the signatory nations of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. "We cannot avoid war, but we can only make the whole world avoid war. If Stimson and the United States could have issued a warning to Japan in 1931, then Japan would not have invaded China today." Professor Fleming of Vanderbilt University advocated immediately recalling the U.S. ambassador to Japan, increasing wartime loans to China, and revising the neutrality law to prevent it from being used by aggressor nations. Guffey advocated accepting Thomas' amendment to the neutrality law. If this is implemented, the Far East will also be greatly affected by this, and the terror of war with Japan will no longer exist. Because Japan is already overwhelmed by China, he then condemned Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Mr. Jane, chairman of the Korean Overseas Chinese Federation in Honolulu, attended the House Foreign Affairs Committee today and strongly supported Thomas' amended neutrality bill and the Guam fortification plan (Note: Thomas' amendment proposes to authorize the President to implement a five-currency embargo against any country deemed to be an aggressor). Jane said that this action would eliminate the fear of war in the Pacific, and Hawaii, Alaska, and the Panama Canal could be free from threats for a long time. Thomas' amendment is enough to eliminate Japan's arrogance and increase the morale of China. At this point, Koreans and liberal-minded Japanese will work hard to establish a peaceful phenomenon in the Far East to restore the prosperity of American trade in the Far East. Japan's expansion is a threat to the Western Hemisphere. Jane then quoted the words of the Japanese Consul in Honolulu as follows: "The U.S. President said that in a few years, Japan will eliminate American commercial interests in China, but the U.S. Congress is very wise and does not agree with the President's words, which proves that the U.S. Congress wants peace, and Japan also needs peace." Jane also quoted the speculation of Suzuki, secretary of the Information Bureau of the former Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "Five years later, Japan will demand that the United States allow Japanese immigrants. Even if the United States does not allow it, Japan will at least obtain the right to immigrate to Alaska, Samoa, and Hawaii."</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e27">U.S. Aid to China, Sanctions Against Japan <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the U.S. movement to aid China and sanction Japan has been developing actively. A Washington dispatch on the 28th stated that U.S. senators who support the government's hard-line diplomatic policy in the Far East are actively pursuing economic sanctions against Japan in Congress. Senator Guffey requested the Foreign Affairs Committee on the 27th to authorize the President to implement an embargo on Japan and to provide material assistance to countries that have been invaded. Professor Fleming of Vanderbilt University advocated immediately recalling the U.S. ambassador to Japan, increasing wartime loans to China, and revising the neutrality law to prevent it from being used by aggressor nations.</p>
<p>The growing movement in the United States to aid China and sanction Japan is primarily because the Japanese aggressors are stepping up their advances, threatening the United States. As Mr. Jane, chairman of the Korean Overseas Chinese Federation in Honolulu, stated to the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 27th: "Five years later, Japan will demand that the United States allow Japanese immigrants. Even if the United States does not allow it, Japan will at least obtain the right to immigrate to Alaska, Samoa, and Hawaii"! Second, our country's perseverance in the united resistance and the rapidly improving situation have increased the United States' confidence in our country's victory and its determination to provide assistance.</p>
<p>We must now do our utmost to support and promote this U.S. movement to aid China and sanction Japan. At the same time, we must also step up the development of countries such as Britain and France. Japan is currently desperately promoting an anti-British movement. If it is said that "five years later Japan will force the United States to allow immigration," then Japan's current actions towards Britain and France are already forcing Britain and France to withdraw from the Far East! The objective environment is already forcing Britain and France to come out and resist. We must adapt to this situation, promote Britain and France to catch up quickly after the United States, and then establish a Far East anti-aggression front and establish a Far East collective security system.</p>

<p>Recently, banditry has been rampant, and robbery and theft have become commonplace. Although the police have been making every effort to investigate and severely punish robbers, they still cannot completely eradicate lawless elements, which has a great impact on public security in Hong Kong.

The theft occurred between Thursday and this morning. He requested that a case be filed and investigated. After receiving the report, the police, considering that a major burglary had occurred in the territory, immediately dispatched several detectives to investigate and inquire about the course of the theft.</p>
<p>Robbery</p>
<p>A robbery occurred in Tsing Lung Village, Tsuen Wan, yesterday morning. It was found that an elderly man, Mr. Mok Tai (61 years old), lives in a wooden house with a numbered bamboo woven door in the village. At 7:30 this morning, four large men, one of whom was holding a fake gun made of children's toys, barged in to commit robbery with great fanfare. They frightened Mr. Mok and his family into a corner. Mr. Mok did not dare to resist because of the robbers' ferocity. After the robbers subdued everyone, they immediately searched the place and stole $90 in cash before leaving in a huff. After the robbers left for a long time, Mr. Mok went to the police station to report the case and request an investigation.</p>

<p>The Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Youth Day Celebration held a preparatory meeting yesterday at 2 PM at the YMCA. More than ten people attended, including Luo Fu, Zhang Yao (Chairman), Rui Kun, Zheng Dechao, and others. The important motion of the day was a proposal by Zheng Dechao, representing the YMCA, to incorporate the Self-Renewal Movement into the commemorative ceremony to ensure that Hong Kong youth earnestly fulfill it. Zheng Dechao first reported:</p>
<p>Self-Renewal Movement: Great Significance</p>
<p>Briefly explaining this movement, it has been prevalent in Shanghai for a long time. Those who practice it can improve their personality, gain proper thinking, and eliminate bad habits, benefiting society and the nation as well. It is proposed that after the commemorative meeting that day, each young student in Hong Kong receive a copy of the Self-Renewal Movement Pledge to place on their desks. Student unions of various schools will lead review meetings for a certain period to report on the results after the meetings and learn from each other. [Section Missing] Allowing youth to receive pure thought training is deeply beneficial for the future of the war of resistance. It was then resolved to add a swearing of the Self-Renewal Movement Pledge to the commemorative ceremony, and to consult with student unions of various schools to request their practical leadership and implementation.</p>
<p>Discussion on Implementation, Expanded Event Continued Discussion (1) On how to expand the event, requesting practical leadership and implementation, it was resolved to send letters to various vocational youth groups, intellectual youth groups, worker youth groups, women's youth groups, and student bodies of various schools to participate. The YMCA, YWCA, Student Relief Association, Huiyang Youth Association, and Youth Relief Fundraising Association were appointed as preparatory committee members. (2) On whether to invite famous figures from outside to give speeches, it was resolved to invite He Xiangning, Zhu Youguang, Jin Zhonghua, Liu Simu, and others to give speeches, with the China Youth League, Paul's Girl's School, Wah Yan College, and other groups responsible for the choral performances that day.</p>
<p>Date of the Assembly and its Venue (3) On how to determine the date and location, it was resolved to hold it at the Carling Road Confucian Hall at 2:30 PM on May 7th. The Student Relief Association is responsible for requesting favors from the government and borrowing the venue. Upon investigation, the Self-Renewal Movement Pledge has been printed, divided into (A) Raising Interest Levels and Choosing Proper Entertainment, (B) Strengthening Group Life and Promoting Disciplinary Spirit, (C) Increasing Research Interests and Developing Scientific Thinking, (D) Eliminating Extravagant Bad Habits and Cultivating Thrifty Habits, (E) Deepening Spiritual Cultivation and Enhancing Service Effectiveness. Investigation shows that item A includes not gambling, not smoking, and not drinking alcohol. Item D includes the provision of using domestic products as much as possible.</p>
<p>Amateur School Immediately Responds The Kowloon China Amateur School Alumni Association responded to the "National Youth Movement Week," scheduling various activities for seven consecutive evenings from May 1st to 7th: "May 1st" Youth Current Affairs Lecture, "May 2nd" Youth Issues Forum, "May 3rd" Youth Achievement Exhibition, "May 4th" Youth Carnival, "May 5th" Youth Speech Contest, "May 6th" Alumni Reunion, "May 7th" Visit to Comfort the Isolated Soldiers in Shatoujiao and Wounded Soldiers in Shenzhen.

<p>The Chinese Manufacturers' Association held its annual member meeting yesterday at 2 PM to elect the fifth board of directors and discuss amendments to the association's constitution. More than one hundred manufacturers attended. The chairman was Ye Lanquan, and the recording secretary was Han Suixuan.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report When the meeting began, Chairman Ye Lanquan delivered a speech, briefly stating that the present was the annual meeting for the association members and the election of the fifth board of directors. The association was established in April of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], and its affairs have been developing daily. In the early years, there were only 51 members, but the number has increased year by year, reaching nearly two hundred members now, which is the highest record since the establishment of the association. During the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], the board of directors held 23 meetings. Important works included the following:</p>
<p>Promoting Domestic Goods (1) When Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded factory products were transported to the mainland, they were taxed as imported goods. Last year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance approved that products from association members, if transported back to Guangdong Province for sale with a certificate from the association, would be exempt from 20% of various special taxes. (2) After the establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, all investigations into Hong Kong factories were officially commissioned by the association with official letters. Recently, the ministry issued certificates of origin for domestic goods, and the initial review was also handled by the association. (3) Last year, in order to promote the use of domestic goods and to make compatriots recognize and discuss domestic goods, the association jointly held a Chinese Goods Exhibition in Hong Kong, which was quite successful. In January of this year, to adapt to the environment, it was held again in Kowloon, on a scale several times larger than before, which can be called an unprecedented event in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Visiting Macau for Investigation (4) In mid-month, at the invitation of Macau officials and gentry, the association organized an inspection team to Macau to investigate industries. Now, there is also a proposal in Macau to organize a Hong Kong-Macau committee. If this matter can be realized, it will truly benefit the industrial and commercial circles of Hong Kong and Macau. (5) Since the "July 7th Incident" occurred, the association immediately joined with the Electrical Appliance Merchants Association to organize a long-term diet and salary donation to raise funds. The association used the funds to purchase Guangdong Province National Defense Public Bonds, donated ambulances, and provided over ten thousand winter clothes to relieve refugees. In addition, there is a request to reduce electricity bills to ease the burden on manufacturers, which is currently underway. The above are just the major items; there are many other things that benefit the manufacturer members, which you should all know. After Ye's speech, the meeting passed the settlement for the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938] and then discussed and passed amendments to the constitution.</p>
<p>Election Results Next, the election was conducted, with Kang Yuan (Ruan Wei Yang), Tian Chu (Mao Zhifu), San Guang (Ruan Qiuming), and Hui Lian (Liu Xuepei) as vote counters, and Feng Qiang (Chen Fangxian) and Baijiali (Liu Shaohui) as poll watchers. As a result of the vote, Xingzhou, Guang Wanlong, Minyuan Cloth Factory, Feng Qiang Rubber Factory, Zhou Yixing, Yongpeng, Zhonghua Brothers Tent Shop, Limin Xingguo, Sanda Cosmetics, Yuanxing, Yongfa, Sanguang, Meili, Tianchu, Kangyuan, Zhonghua MSG, and Huayi were elected as the 19 next-term directors on duty. The National Lacquer Factory, Hong Kong Xiamen Tao Hua Da Tong Company, Tianzhen Lithographic Printing Office, and Baijiali were elected as alternate directors. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e36">After the Wuhan Chorus Left Hong Kong, They Spread the Anti-Japanese Propaganda to Singapore and Beyond <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Mentioning the "Wuhan Chorus," the moving patriotic songs seem to still resonate in my ears. At any singing event, upon hearing, "Fight back to the Northeast! Fight back to the Northeast!" "He killed our compatriots!" "He invaded our land!" [Section Missing], these majestic and rhythmic songs immediately remind people of the "Wuhan Chorus."</p>
<p>Hong Kong's musical standards are not low; it is like a fertile soil in the land of music. However, the Wuhan Chorus cannot be denied as being a gardener, planting seeds of anti-Japanese songs here and sprouting them.</p>
<p>Since the troupe left Hong Kong for Singapore in mid-December last year, the Hong Kong singing community has suddenly become active. Their work in Singapore has also been progressing very smoothly. Recently, the troupe's drama team leader, Mr. Xiang Kun, came to Hong Kong from Singapore, and the reporter had the opportunity to meet and chat with him at the Hotel des Six Nations. During the conversation, Mr. Xiang was filled with the joy of work, and the reporter was also happy with him.</p>
<p>When the Wuhan Chorus set off from Wuhan, they did not have much preparation for drama, so the public performance in Hong Kong last year was just an experiment and attempt, and the results were not as good as the singing, which was not entirely satisfactory. Although the troupe is named "Chorus," it is actually an ordinary propaganda team. In order to strengthen the drama lineup, Mr. Xiang came to Hong Kong from afar to recruit troops, planning to recruit two female roles and one male role. In just a few days, dozens of people applied. Unfortunately, most of the capable actors have already joined group work. Speaking of the criteria for admission, in addition to speaking fluent Mandarin, they should have a high degree of enthusiasm and sincerity for anti-Japanese dramas. After being admitted, the new actors will be provided with food, clothing, housing, and transportation by the troupe. During the day, they will return to the team in Singapore with Mr. Xiang. Under the hard work of Mr. Xiang, the future of the troupe's drama is already showing unlimited dawn.</p>
<p>They have worked in Singapore for four months, performed more than one hundred times, and raised 300,000 national currency for the local relief fundraising association. The anti-Japanese climax in Singapore has become even more surging. They not only moved the upper classes in high-end theaters, but also had a great effect on the common people. They did not just sing choruses. Each performance appeared in the form of singing and drama complementing each other, which is their improved style. Many anti-Japanese groups have grown up in this way.</p>
<p>The love of the overseas Chinese for them is truly meticulous. The wealthy opened their gardens to entertain them warmly, and the vast overseas Chinese donated whatever they had. The Relief Association said that the shoes of the Wuhan Chorus members were broken, and someone sent shoes. Even barbershops often came to offer their services. Their lives have simply become the "public pig" of the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese are deeply gratified that the "public" has "pigs" to raise. The chorus friends are also deeply gratified that the spiritual comfort gained by the "public pig" is a joy that was unimaginable in their past university life and teacher life. They more deeply experienced how honored it is to serve the motherland and be a "public pig."</p>
<p>Recalling when they set off from Wuhan, Madam Chiang Kai-shek once comforted them: "The country is in urgent need of funds, and it would be best if you can be independent and not use the country's money. If you have economic difficulties in the future, we will definitely give you a helping hand immediately. You should do a good job!"</p>
<p>Now it seems that they not only did not use a penny of the country's money, but also donated all 300,000 yuan they raised to the public. Their daily lives were spent happily in the entertainment of the Overseas Chinese Relief Association and enthusiastic overseas Chinese. Here, we got an inspiration: "Spiritual comfort is better than material reward; efforts to be loyal to the country and the public will surely win the love and help of compatriots."</p>
<p>In addition to engaging in propaganda and fundraising through singing and drama, they have not relaxed their self-education and local liaison work. The overseas Chinese groups in various states of Singapore have heard the news and have asked them to perform. Statistically, it would take two or three years to travel to all the ports of the Malay Peninsula, so the scheduled time for all aspects was cut in half: February was changed to January, January was changed to half a month, and two weeks was changed to one week. They had already left Singapore for Johor in early this month and are still working in Johor. It is expected that they will be able to complete the mission of traveling to the Malay Peninsula in February next year and return to Singapore.</p>
<p>When they were about to leave Singapore, they once held a grand music conference with local music groups and once performed "Thunderstorm" alone. The purpose was to let the overseas Chinese understand that the art of the motherland has progressed to this point, so as to inspire the national self-confidence of the overseas Chinese after the anti-Japanese propaganda. When they performed "Thunderstorm," they specifically publicized that its intention was the advocacy of "art" and "ethics," which was only a side effect and did not conflict with the original anti-Japanese propaganda mission. After gaining the understanding of the overseas Chinese, the fundraising income also increased suddenly, and the overseas Chinese also requested them to continue performing.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xiang to the reporter: the Mandarin level and music level of Singapore are very high, but the drama is like sand. Their original 28 male and female team members have added several music talents in Singapore, but drama talents have to be found in Hong Kong. One of the main reasons why they were able to have such a harvest this time is that it was the first time that a sound propaganda team and art group went to Singapore.</p>
<p>Their work moved the overseas Chinese, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese also moved them. In particular, the millionaires generously encouraged their children to join the machine workers' team and return to the country to serve. The patriotic blood flowed into each other; the patriotic sincerity resonated with each other. Wherever there are Chinese, there are interwoven scenes that can be sung and wept. How great the motherland is! How bright the future of the motherland is!</p>
<h3 id="e37">Kowloon YMCA Establishes Free Schools in Various Districts to Accommodate Homeless Poor Children, Currently There are Six Schools with Twenty Teachers, and Over One Thousand Street Children have Enrolled <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>In view of the fact that poor children living on the streets in the Peninsula lack education, the Kowloon Chinese YMCA, fearing that they would enter the wrong path and harm society, joined with the headmistress of the Mat Tau Kok Association for Mutual Thought Girls' School, the Western Miss Bu, and many philanthropists to establish many night schools in various places on the Peninsula. The teachers and staff in the schools are all volunteers from enthusiastic families. According to the teacher Hua Zhuoquan, these schools have been opened for four months and are set up in Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Hung Hom, Kowloon City, and Tsim Sha Tsui to accommodate children sleeping on the roadside to enroll and study. The teachers impart civic education and various courses, as well as singing and other knowledge. When the school was first established, it was very difficult. Now, the children have realized that this measure is beneficial to them, so they have enrolled in large numbers. The school sites in each district are donated by enthusiastic churches or schools. If there is no site, it is held in other people's gardens or on the streetside. As for the teachers and staff of each school, they are all volunteers from enthusiastic people, and everyone has a job, so they cannot come out to take charge every night. Now, it is scheduled to start classes from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM every Thursday and Sunday evening. Currently, there are over one thousand children from various districts who come to study, with twenty teachers. On holidays, they lead the children to travel to various places to increase their knowledge. As for the expenses of the school, they are donated by generous donors.</p>

<h3 id="e38">New Stage of Hong Kong's Drama Movement <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>"Huanghuagang" is a glorious monument!</p>
<p>Hong Kong was exposed to Western drama earlier than the mainland; however, that was limited to foreigners and a few "Chinese gentlemen," and had nothing to do with the general public or even intellectuals. Apart from the fleeting appearance of "vernacular drama" of Shanghai's civilized drama, Hong Kong intellectuals' acceptance of drama, generally speaking, came after accepting movies (especially domestic movies imitating Western ones).</p>
<p>Like other cities, drama was initially practiced by school art lovers as a way to experiment with dramatic literature. Then, it became one of the less important but indispensable items in the recreational events. Again, one or two good Productions staged public performances here to raise funds. After the September 18th Incident, drama became a movement among the intellectuals in Hong Kong. After the July 7th Incident, drama gradually influenced citizens, influenced the public, and movies and Cantonese opera, at least in content, had to accept its suggestions. In the past six months, due to the deepening of the war, the southward migration of professional drama troupes, the increase in the number of mainland workers staying in Hong Kong, and the increase in the public's need for drama, the drama movement has written a glorious and brilliant page.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the scale of performances has greatly increased, the technology has advanced to a high degree, and gradually, drama can also become an industry, can be constantly worked on, can develop normally, and can provide audiences seeking entertainment with disinfected and nourishing spiritual food. This situation has become more and more obvious since Guangdong became a war zone.</p>
<p>However, in order to make drama a gospel of national liberation, to make drama an enlightenment for the masses, to make drama obey and serve national interests, and to make Hong Kong's drama movement an organic part of China's national salvation drama movement, we have no way to be optimistic and no way to be satisfied with our own work. We need self-examination, self-criticism: we need greater solidarity, more planned division of labor; we need to strengthen self-education, we need the Stakhanovite spirit of blitzkrieg.</p>
<p>We must unite: only in this way will everyone be loving and sincere, and work together, so as not to be infected with the poison of the commercial theater of "actors despising each other" or "competing for business." We must divide the labor: the waste of manpower and material resources of fighting separately, the effectiveness limited to one corner, and the loss is incalculable. Only through common will and precise allocation can drama serve the people and the country more directly and powerfully. We must establish self-education: only in this way can we consciously and firmly fight for the freedom of the nation, and not fall into the quagmire of the "actors" of the past, and become the dregs of the war of resistance. We must practice the spirit of blitzkrieg: only in this way can we stand upright and establish our work in the current difficult environment; only in this way can we, after training, deeply enter the interior or enter the front line, and contribute and sacrifice everything for the survival of the motherland with arrows and stones.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's drama movement does not only belong to drama workers, but also belongs to the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, and belongs to the future of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Hong Kong Youth Association is an epoch-making event in the history of Hong Kong's drama movement. Young and pure, enthusiastic drama workers have united, and they will become a team like copper and iron. Workers from Guangdong who have been tempered by the War of Resistance have added even more fresh troops, and they will work together with several drama troupes with relatively rich performance experience in the Chinese Art Troupe of the Era. The united front of the Hong Kong drama community can be said to be established.</p>
<p>The performance of "Huanghuagang" mobilized all the drama groups, and hundreds of people enthusiastically participated in the work. There was no distinction between this border and that border, and there was no thought of the importance of interests. Everyone only had a passionate and heroic heart to seek liberation for the motherland! This is an unprecedented phenomenon and a glorious monument to the drama community's efforts to resist the war and the drama movement!</p>
<p>We must remember this new stage of the drama: choosing scripts that can match the current political situation, concentrating all the workers to perform, striving for the practice of popularization, so that the artistic effectiveness and political effectiveness are organically and uniformly instilled in the people and the public, and the result of the performance directly contributes to the relief of the suffering compatriots, or strengthens the manpower and material resources of national salvation: this is the characteristic of the current stage of the Hong Kong drama movement, and it is also the right path that should be set for the drama work in the second phase of the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Tentative Essay on Realism in Film <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>Realism is a creative method that permeates all artistic fields. It represents the pinnacle of creative methods attainable in artistic activities and creative practices since the beginning of human history. It is the highest stage in the development of artistic techniques throughout human history, guiding all writers to truthfully reflect and express reality. It leads writers to discover and create complete art forms. It is the most powerful approach to objectively and truthfully depicting "typical characters in typical environments." By grasping it, writers can deeply approach objective reality, discover and correct errors in their worldviews. This method of realism is the highest comprehensive and critical achievement of the entire history of human art. It not only exists in all artistic fields outside of film today, but it also penetrates film art with an extraordinary force.</p>
<p>Film, this most modern art form, has unlimited adaptability and need for modern realism. Film art itself is a product of the era of highly developed science and technology in human society. On the one hand, it organically integrates the positive elements of various artistic fields of mankind. On the other hand, it possesses its own unique technical (mechanical) characteristics, thereby establishing its complete form through the mutual exchange and combination of general artistic elements and special technical conditions. This form carries a strong sense of complete comprehensiveness, novelty, imagery, and mass appeal. Undoubtedly, such a form is only suitable for applying realism, and only under the guidance of the creative method of realism can it achieve its development and success. Realism, as a superior guiding force and as the basic method of film creation, gives film artistic depth and refinement, making it a complete art form and endowing it with realistic artistic content. Therefore, realism is an organic component that deeply enters film art and becomes the main life of film art.</p>
<p>Realism in film is sufficient to produce a completely decisive effect on the entire film creation process. On the one hand, it guides filmmakers to recognize reality, leading them to grasp the fundamental things from complex reality, and dominating the cognitive process of film production. On the other hand, it also guides filmmakers to express reality, influencing their techniques, methods, and styles, enabling film art to truthfully reflect objective reality in the most sound, perfect, and clear image, dominating the expression process of film production. However, this decisive power of realism for film is completely the same as the power it can exert on other artistic fields. This is originally the common function of realism on all artistic departments, not unique to film art. If we want to understand the basic characteristics of realism in film art, we must explore the essence of film.</p>
<p>The special characteristic of realism in film exists in the essence of film art. Film art is an organic synthesis of general artistic factors and special technical conditions. From the perspective of being a synthesis of all arts, film has not only images, but also colors and sounds. These images, colors, and sounds are the basic tools for film to reflect objective reality. However, if the images, colors, and sounds of film are only used as copies of realistic images, colors, and sounds, then it loses its special and independent artistic significance. The images, colors, and sounds in film art should not only be copies of reality, but should be a new creation of realistic images, colors, and sounds. The special characteristic of realism in film lies in executing this creative work of reality through the organic application of special film techniques. Realism must use its superiority in creative methods, cooperate with the special nature of film technology, to implement this creation, so that the positive elements contained in various artistic fields of mankind, and the special technical characteristics unique to film art itself, can obtain new cooperation and new integration on the basis of new creation. This is the basic characteristic of realism in film.</p>
<p>Film is an emerging, vigorous, and young art. It is a tender sprout rooted in the modern accumulation of highly developed culture. Only by obtaining the nourishment of the realistic creative method, which is also one of the accumulations of human culture, can it bloom beautiful flowers. Today, in order to endow film art with a more beautiful and complete form, and in order to make the creation of film art achieve overall success, filmmakers must strive to grasp new realism from their own artistic practice and the improvement of their artistic cultivation. Suddenly urged in the evening of April 26th.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Active Struggle in the Motherland - The Dongjiang Mobile Opera Troupe <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>In the faint light of a dawn at the end of the previous two months, the Guangzhou-Kowloon train dragged a dozen young workers away, leaving the lewd Hong Kong Island and rushing into the embrace of the motherland full of flames of war.</p>
<p>A green velvet flag fluttered in the high sky, brightly embroidered with "Dongjiang Mobile Opera Troupe."</p>
<p>They were originally a group of service teams returning to the Dongjiang area to carry out anti-Japanese propaganda and organize the people. They took the form of songs and dramas as the central work, cooperated with all the strength and skills of a propaganda team, and carried out mobile propaganda work.</p>
<p>Obviously, after the first invasion of Dongjiang by the × people and their subsequent defeat, what was left behind was broken tiles and rubble and cruel and painful memories. Now, the × people are preparing for a second invasion conspiracy. Therefore, under the urgent call to defend Dongjiang, strengthening the organization of the people and the education of the people is urgently needed.</p>
<p>The "Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps" organized by overseas Chinese in the Dongjiang area has established sub-groups in various counties and districts, and in a very short period of time, it organized a mobile singing and drama troupe to work in various parts of Dongjiang.</p>
<p>The "Dongjiang Mobile Opera Troupe" thus departed from Hong Kong on February 11.</p>
<p>...Courageously traversing the abdomen of the Dongjiang</p>
<p>Starting from losing the train in Shenzhen, a long trek began towards Pingshan. They arrived at Pingshan Market on the same day and were warmly welcomed by the Pingshan Guerrilla Area. After working there for three days, they moved to Danshui. This kind of movement allowed them to bravely traverse the abdomen of the Dongjiang in two months!</p>
<p>Starting from Pingshan, passing through Danshui, Zhoutian, Shuangtian, Maxixi, Liangjing, Pingshan, Sanduozhu, Chishi, Xiagang, Meilong, and finally reaching Haiyan County, and reaching Haifeng County.</p>
<p>What a long and arduous march this is!</p>
<p>In this long journey, they exerted the highest degree of singing and drama. Especially the effect of the latter was very successful. Every time they arrived at a place, they performed dramas to carry out propaganda and improve the people's awareness and enthusiasm for the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The best impressions gained along the way were Pingshan, Danshui, Zhoutian Shuangtian and Maxixi. These places have been harassed by the × people or bombed by × planes. Therefore, the people have a very clear understanding of the × people, and propaganda is easy to do, and work is easy to achieve results.</p>
<p>Especially Pingshan and Zhoutian are better. The Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Team is doing a good job in Pingshan. The people's awareness is very high, and Zhoutian has a relatively high level of culture, and the people's enthusiasm for the Anti-Japanese War is also very high. The Anti-Enemy Comrades Group organized there has already had more than 500 people participating, and women account for a particularly large number, and the future is very promising.</p>
<p>However, passing through places such as Sanduozhu showed that it was not as good. Taking Sanduozhu as an example, the people there have very little awareness of the Anti-Japanese War, and the concept of clan is also very strong. In particular, the "fear of Japan disease" is very widely spread. In the current stage of the Anti-Japanese War, it is very bad that this phenomenon is still spreading in the vast rural areas. This clearly points out that our people's mobilization is not enough, and we still need to urgently work!</p>
<p>...Igniting the flames of the Anti-Japanese War in Haifeng City</p>
<p>Haifeng County is a relatively large county in Dongjiang. In the era of revolution, it had experienced the baptism and training of the great era. However, precisely because of this, it now stubbornly inherits the old forces that can hinder the development of the new Anti-Japanese War situation.</p>
<p>However, when the Dongjiang Mobile Opera Troupe arrived in this ancient county on March 13, it bravely ignited a fiery flame of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>After contacting and liaising with the local government and various people's organizations, they immediately began work in various aspects. On the evening of the 31st, at the invitation of the party department, they participated in the performance of the "Haifeng All Circles Performing Arts Raising Funds for the Frontline Soldiers' Shoes and Socks Conference." The repertoire included "Blood Sprinkled on the Sentimental Sky," "Seeking Survival from Death," "Poison Noodles," and "Song of the Night," as well as the Haiping Middle School singing team, and the county-run No. 2 Elementary School children's drama "Memorial Hall," etc., and the results were very good.</p>
<p>Later, they performed "Those Who Have Strength Contribute Strength," "Seeking Survival from Death," and "Under the Sun Flag" at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, and also held street lectures, a one-cent movement, and other work. Then, at the invitation of the local Second District and Fourth District, they went to those places to carry out patrol work, responsible for drama guidance and people's organization, and in a very short period of time, they set off the anti-Japanese wave at the bottom of Haiyan with the greatest strength.</p>
<p>Recently, it is planned to jointly perform "Thunderstorm" and "Defend Lugou Bridge" with local groups such as the "Weiming Drama Club," "Youth Anti-Japanese Comrades Association," and "Women's Association," and the proceeds will be used to establish a drama association, which is very important for the Haifeng National Salvation Drama Movement.</p>
<p>...A stronger struggle on the land of the motherland</p>
<p>In the two months of struggle, they deeply realized the importance of their responsibilities and felt that the vast work needed to be strengthened and developed. Therefore, the original partners were not enough, so the troupe sent people back to Hong Kong to supplement and increase new members.</p>
<p>The reporter met yesterday with Chen Yimin, the political instructor responsible for supplementing the troupe members on this trip back to Hong Kong, and learned in detail about the troupe's work process. He also talked about the urgent need for young workers to return to work not only in one place but everywhere. In fact, the vast masses of people need us to organize and educate them, especially in the final struggle of one person's dying gasp, it is urgent to mobilize the people to defend their hometowns!</p>
<p>How important is this precious and urgent call to the young workers in Hong Kong!</p>
<p>This time back to Hong Kong, five new young partners were found in a very short period of time to participate, two women and three men, all of whom were very capable and had great work enthusiasm in drama and singing. These new fighters will make their struggle stronger and more active on the land of the motherland!</p>
<p>Now, they have embarked on a new journey again and left Hong Kong by sailboat to Haiyan, and will work more fully in Haiyan for a month, and then move to Heyuan, Zijin and other counties for mobile and patrol work, hoping to travel all over the upper and lower reaches of Dongjiang.</p>
<p>Bless them: Struggle forever in the embrace of the motherland full of flames of war.</p>
<h3 id="e41">An Unprecedented Grand Alliance of Hong Kong's Drama Circles - The Public Performance of "Huanghuagang" is Approaching <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xi</p>
<p>——Starting May 3rd at the Taiping Theater——</p>
<p>"Use hot blood to irrigate the flower of freedom, and build the triumphal arch with white bones." Without "March 29th," how could there be "October 10th"; without the foundation of the Republic of China, how could there be this national war of resistance; without this national war of resistance, how could there be a victorious tomorrow! In today's intense war of resistance, with victory in sight, it is time to sing the spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves to become benevolent and leave a lasting reputation; to raise funds to comfort the families of the fallen generals and soldiers in the war of resistance to comfort the martyrs under the nine springs - this should be a great and righteous act!</p>
<p>Recently, the Hong Kong All Circles Relief Federation for South China Refugees, in order to comfort the families of the fallen generals and soldiers, specially invited all Hong Kong drama groups to hold a joint grand performance. The script for this fund-raising performance happens to be "Huanghuagang." The completion of this script is the collective creation of more than 20 progressive dramatists, an unprecedented achievement in the drama circles. It vividly presents the most tragic and greatest historical sites of the Chinese nation on the stage.</p>
<p>This fund-raising performance is a union of more than 40 drama groups, mobilizing more than 300 people backstage and front stage, fully demonstrating the unprecedented unity of the Hong Kong drama circles. The Hong Kong All Circles Relief Federation's active preparation and enthusiastic hard work are also writing a glorious page in the history of Hong Kong's overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>"Huanghuagang" was originally scheduled to be performed on the Huanghua Festival; however, due to insufficient preparation and careful arrangements, it was decided to be performed at the Taiping Theater for three consecutive days starting on May 3rd. This can symbolize even more that although the yellow flowers have fallen, we will never forget the merits of the martyrs.</p>
<p>The directing team of "Huanghuagang" consists of Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Zhong Qinan, Huang Chanlin, Lu Dun, Tan Guochi and other pioneers of the drama movement. They have been actively rehearsing for a month, and the future performance is expected to be amazing.</p>
<p>The Special Committee for the Huanghuagang Performance of the Relief Federation has been actively preparing these days, and the work has already begun to take shape. The only problem now is waiting for us to recognize and sell admission tickets and help sell admission tickets. The ticket prices are set at five yuan, three yuan, one yuan, and three jiao, four kinds, can we still refuse to do our best? The martyrs shed blood, the actors and workers sweat, but we appreciate the most advanced dramatic art and receive the most revolutionary baptism, is there still any reluctance?</p>
<p>It must also be remembered; the funds raised from this charity performance are to comfort the families of the fallen generals and soldiers in the war of resistance!</p>
<p>(Editor's note: A special issue of "Huanghuagang" will be published on May 3rd, the day of the performance. Readers are requested to pay attention.)</p>

<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>The First Performance After the Bombing—in Xuzhou</p>
<p>It was early autumn, and the yellow sand of Xuzhou filled the sky. The pulley cars rolled on and on, unfolding a kind of northern charm. The climate was particularly hot, and the streets and alleys were filled with shuttling people, bustling and bustling. From time to time, groups of armed brothers, political workers, and self-defense forces passed through solemnly. Large white-character slogans were posted everywhere on the earthen walls; the air of war had permeated this ancient city.</p>
<p>At the station, the armed brothers questioned us very carefully. When they saw the passport given to us by the military authorities, they let us pass through very kindly.</p>
<p>"The front line is fighting well, right? We can't retreat this time, damn ×× devils!" He said with a smile and straightforwardness, and the yellow hand grenade stood out vividly on the gray military uniform.</p>
<p>Out of the main road, the comrades of the People's Education Museum came to greet us hand in hand. A small newly built auditorium in the museum can accommodate 500 people. We lived in two rooms behind the auditorium. They were busy fetching water, pouring tea, and exchanging greetings; we were busy telling them about our departure, asking about the situation of the mass movement in Xuzhou, and the work we planned to do after arriving in Xuzhou.</p>
<p>"Very good, very good," said the curator, Zhao Jun. "This place needs you very much. Your arrival will definitely have a significant impact on the intellectuals and the masses."</p>
<p>"Regarding the audience, we entrust you completely to arrange the viewing of the show"; we said: "Because we are not familiar with the situation in Xuzhou. Our principles are one, not selling tickets, and two, not soliciting donations."</p>
<p>"How can it work not selling tickets?" Zhao Jun continued, "The venue is small, wouldn't it be unable to accommodate many people?"</p>
<p>We have always performed in two ways, one is on the stage, and the other is on the street. When performing in the auditorium, please print some tickets and distribute them.</p>
<p>This is how we decided on our performance in Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Near evening, the setting sun shone on the flower garden of the Education Museum, and the red flowers and white flowers looked even softer. The air was very quiet, and suddenly there was a very heavy and turbid roar in the distant sky, "What is this?" We stopped the rehearsal work and asked a comrade from the Education Museum next to us. "This is a bullock cart," he replied. When we first arrived in Xuzhou, we didn't quite understand what the sound of a bullock cart was like.</p>
<p>We continued to rehearse the play, and another group of comrades practiced singing, preparing for the evening broadcast. But in less than two minutes, six heavy bombers came towards us with their teeth and claws. Everyone looked up, pondering in their hearts: "This sound is unreliable, it's the × people!" Before we had time to think further, bullets rained down like rain; the high-shooting machine gunner in gray hurried to the position, and the woman ran around with her child in her arms. "Don't walk, lie down quickly!" Our comrades lying in the flower bushes shouted. "I'm the one who fires the machine gun"; the brothers in gray immediately exerted their firepower in the position inside the earthen slope.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Oh! Oh no, why are we lying next to the machine gun position! But, there's no way, we had to lie there motionless, shrapnel, fireballs, and mud, flying past us. Not far away, there was an deafening crashing sound from the top of a mountain. This aimless massacre continued for 20 minutes, and then the aerial bandits adorned with ugly sun symbols finally fled under the power of our machine guns.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and the assembly bugle from the North Station sent a clear message to everyone's ears. The fire brigade's whistle screamed loudly, and six trains safely left. The main purpose of the × planes was to bomb our train (the train was full of armed brothers heading to the front), but they dropped all the bombs on Zifang Mountain, destroying the house of the engineer living on the top of the mountain and his entire family, leaving only the elderly engineer alive and miserable. But later, the blood of his beloved family enabled him to exert an active and unimaginable efficacy in the work of the Longhai Road.</p>
<p>The alarm personnel of the Sili were immediately dismissed.</p>
<p>At night, there were no electric lights, no moon, no stars in the whole city. Patches of dark clouds moved in the sky, and the alarm was issued sharply twice in a row. The people were exceptionally awake and calm; they quietly walked to the air-raid shelter in the dark. One after another, we groped in the dark on the wet grass and walked into the small air-raid shelter built by the Education Museum. The comrades from the Education Museum were already there. At this time, we discussed the work in detail and decided to invite people from all walks of life to the auditorium the next night. The play was our collective creation, and the "Defend the Ancestral Country" was performed using the method of a living report.</p>

<p>The anti-Japanese documentary film "Anti-Japanese Special Subject" produced by the Political Department of the Military Commission and exported by the China Film Studio, from the first episode to the fifth episode, has been shown in Hong Kong and has received unprecedented praise. Under the ardent desire of thousands of overseas Chinese, the good news that the sixth episode has been completed and connected to Hong Kong has also spread to the ears of overseas Chinese. The sixth episode includes the victory of De'an, a final glimpse of Guangzhou and Wuhan during the retreat, the Nanyue Conference convened by Chairman Chiang to decide on the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War, as well as frontline generals from the east, west, north and south battlefields, such as Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Xue Yue, and Shang Zhen, all of whom are filmed on the screen. This is a film with rich content and great value, and this journal has solemnly recommended it in the previous issue. Now, the Liaison Office of the Hong Kong Members of the National Literary Association has specifically set the morning of May 5th at 10 o'clock at the Cathay Theater to entertain the cultural circles of Hong Kong to appreciate this rare anti-Japanese film.</p>
<p>"A Year" will be performed</p>
<p>Xia Yan is now convening the Performance Committee</p>
<p>Xia Yan, editor-in-chief of the National Salvation Daily and a playwright, has made many contributions to the national salvation drama movement in Hong Kong since his arrival. Recently, he plans to call on playwrights in Hong Kong to jointly perform his latest masterpiece "A Year" in order to raise funds for cultural undertakings in China. This matter was once used to entertain famous directors and actors in Hong Kong to discuss the performance. The Performance Committee was immediately established. It is now scheduled to invite famous figures in the Hong Kong drama circles, Ouyang Yuqian, Cai Chusheng, Situ Huimin, Tang Huaiqiu, Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Hu Xiangbing, Su Yi, Lu Dun, Lu Fu and others to the Saints Hotel at 4 pm today to hold the first meeting of the Performance Committee to discuss all the proceedings,</p>
<p>"China Art" and "China Travel"</p>
<p>Famous plays were performed separately last week</p>
<p>The drama movement this week is really lively. In addition to "Huanghuagang" being rehearsed intensively, "China Art" and "China Travel" performed. From the 27th, "China Art" performed the new plays "Di Si Niang" adapted by Zhang Daofan from the original work of the French literary crowd Xiao E, "The Hypocrite" from the original work of the French Moliere, and "The Green Gauze Tent" written by Ouyang Yuqian for several days at the Central Theater, and received unprecedented praise. This is indeed a successful harvest in the third performance of China Art.</p>
<p>After the reconstruction of "China Broadcast," Wu Zuguang's "Phoenix City" was performed for the first time for the Women's Federation on the 28th. The performance of this play was quite successful, and it undoubtedly laid the foundation for the newborn "China Travel".</p>

<h3 id="e46">First Division Football Championship Runner-up Battle: Eastern Club Defeats Navy, 3-2 Victory Ascends to Second Place, Among the Three Shanghai Players, Cao Qiuting is the Most Outstanding <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock at Caroline Hill, the stands were packed with people, both Chinese and Western, numbering over half a myriad, making it the most popular match since the Eastern football team was promoted to the First Division.</p>
<p>This competition was of great importance, concerning the runner-up spot in the First Division League, to be decided here. If Eastern were to win, it would complete the feat of our Chinese teams taking both the championship and runner-up positions.</p>
<p>"Poverty reveals ambition, urgency reveals drama." Eastern indirectly created an opportunity thanks to South China, leading to this runner-up battle. Sure enough, united as one, victory was the goal. Despite the fact that many key players were injured after returning from the South, they fought bravely against the well-rested Navy, winning the battle and ascending to "second place."</p>
<p>In my opinion, Eastern's victory yesterday was entirely based on the success of strengthening the forward line. If the lineup had not been adjusted at the last minute, and had played as published in the newspaper, I fear it would not have achieved this result.</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng and Liu Shizan performed extremely swiftly and logically. Although their positions were not ideally suited, their rapid running and daring, both in the back and suddenly in the front, were enough to compensate for any shortcomings. They rarely made mistakes, advanced and retreated in unison, and coordinated well, thus achieving the effect of communication.</p>
<p>Among the Eastern players, the three Shanghai players attracted the most attention. Therefore, it is worth describing how they performed. Right midfielder Jiang Shanqing can be described as having solid skills, not losing the demeanor of a famous general. However, his movements were slightly slow, which may be due to being away from football for too long. The second goal conceded in the second half and the major scare in the last second were both caused by Lao Jiang not being able to contain Morris, leading to a crisis. However, this is not solely Lao Jiang's responsibility, but he was the one who bore the brunt.</p>
<p>Xu Wenkui played as the right inside forward in the first half, and then switched with Yu Qiaxing in the second half. It seemed that Lao Xu's movements were very slow. He often lightly lost balls that he should not have missed to the opposing defender, and he was not good at sprinting. However, his passing was quite accurate, which was the only good thing we saw from him yesterday.</p>
<p>Left winger Cao Qiuting performed outstandingly, being the number one player in the forward line. His shots were powerful and his attacks were fast. The Navy defenders, Nigro and Collinson, had headaches when they encountered him and could not stop him. However, because he was good at seizing opportunities to advance, he often committed offsides, just like Hou Chengtang.</p>
<p>Eastern's first and second goals were unexpected gains and were quite lucky. The third goal was shot clearly and delicately, so his battle功 was half due to luck and half due to human effort.</p>
<p>Throughout the match, the most commendable act was Xu Heng's heroic effort in the last second, which can be described as a miraculous feat of saving the day. If he had failed, the game would have had to go into overtime, and then Eastern's runner-up position might have been lost due to the overtime. Therefore, Lao Xu's action was not only a great personal achievement, but more importantly, it maintained Eastern's glory.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the Navy's failure was that goalkeeper Jashin's performance was abnormal. He must bear some responsibility for the first and second goals conceded. Secondly, the forwards were not good at shooting, and the team's overall performance was not as brilliant as it was in the match against South China last week. They only achieved an average level against Eastern, and it can be said that they were evenly matched. Therefore, Eastern's victory was not accidental.</p>
<p>After the two teams lined up, the battle began. Shi Zuan sent the ball to Deqi, and Xandi intercepted it and cleared the ball out of danger. Armstrong launched a counterattack, forcing a corner kick, which Tobin intercepted and cleared.</p>
<p>After four minutes, Armstrong passed the ball to Tobin on the wing, who approached and shot, grazing past the goal. Morse was too late to catch up, and Shizan forcefully pushed it out of bounds.</p>
<p>After five minutes, Eastern mobilized its entire army, and Deqi attacked. Wenkui supported from the middle, but he could not lift his foot near the goal and passed it to Bingtu, who fell to the ground, losing the opportunity.</p>
<p>From then on, the two sides went back and forth, like a tug-of-war, and the battle was quite spectacular.</p>
<p>At the 32nd minute, the Navy took the offensive. Weiquan kicked the ball back to his own half to save the urgent situation, but Tobin rushed in, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, Zhongyun's foot was skillful and sent the ball out. Deqi regained possession in the midfield, drew his bow, and advanced. From about 20 yards in front of the goal, he launched a cold arrow. The ball rolled in, and everyone thought it had gone out of bounds. Jashin also did not pay attention to it and treated it lightly. By the time the ball crashed into the net, Jashin was unable to save it. 1-0, Eastern took the lead.</p>
<p>The Navy, having lost first, was thinking of revenge. At the 34th minute, Armstrong was seen attacking, shooting from the side of the goal line with great urgency. Fortunately, Xu Heng hugged the ball tightly, and nothing happened. Soon after, the first half ended.</p>
<p>Five minutes into the second half, Bingtu quickly broke through and passed a wonderful ball. Wenkui was one step too late and was cleared by Xandi. Jingcheng intercepted the ball in the middle and slowly advanced, pretending to choose someone to pass to. While the Navy defense was slightly careless, he kicked fiercely with his left foot from 40 yards away. The ball left the ground by about one foot and flew into the Navy's goal like a cannonball. Jashin was helpless, stunned and错愕. The score became 2-0, and Eastern won again.</p>
<p>At the 15th minute, Armstrong 활團 defended the wing, passing and maneuvering with Tobin. They reached Eastern's territory. Tobin crossed from the goal line, but the Eastern defense could not stop them. Armstrong slanted out to fill Tobin's empty position. Watching the ball come down from above, he rushed to抢夺, and with the ball, crashed into the net. 1-2, the Navy reduced the deficit.</p>
<p>At the 20th minute, Bingtu, with the help of Wenkui and Deqi's transportation, cut into the middle on the wing. The ball fell to the corner of the Navy's goal. Qiushi arrived in time and, from a few feet away from the side of the goal, aimed at the goal line and shot fiercely into the net. 3-1, stabilizing the victory.</p>
<p>At the 33rd minute, the Navy's offensive was very strong. Eight armies advanced deep into Eastern's territory, doing their best to harass. Finally, center forward Morris 近射 scored, making the score 2-3.</p>
<p>The center circle reopened, and the Navy still took the offensive. Eastern worked hard to defend, and it was extremely thrilling. In the last second, Morris saw the ball and rushed forward. Shanqing did not watch him closely and was passed. At this point, Xu Heng was defending the isolated city, like a prisoner awaiting judgment. Fortunately, when Morris raised his foot to shoot, "Brother Heng" happened to hold the ball up with both hands, lifting the ball high and sending it out of the goal. He escaped this great disaster. It was truly fortunate, and before the Navy could take a corner kick, the ceasefire signal had already sounded. Eastern finally won 3-2,榮居 runner-up.

<h3 id="e47">Pui Ying Performs Excellently, Still Loses to South China, Great China Police Victory in Second Division <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>In the Open Men's Basketball Tournament, in the first match last night, Great China of the Second Division faced Hong Yuen. In the first half, Great China was forced to fall behind. As a result, they only narrowly defeated Hong Yuen by 30 to 28. In the second match, South China of the First Division faced Pui Ying. Since the start of the tournament, the former had only lost once to South China, and its record was unmatched. However, in yesterday's match against Pui Ying, under stubborn resistance, they forced a tie twice. At the end of the first half, they also only narrowly lost by 20 to 22. Unfortunately, Pui Ying did not have enough stamina, and in the second half, they fell further and further behind. As a result, they were eventually defeated by South China by 56 to 34. However, Pui Ying's defeat was not due to a lack of effort. The excellent performance of each player was unprecedented. Lin Wanli and Pan Jinhong attacked from the flanks, and with their agile turns, they were often able to break through the enemy's defense. Although their shots were not always accurate, they were much better than before. Center Li Lianze charged into the enemy's lines and was unstoppable, repeatedly posing a threat to the opponent. Qiu Yingbian and He Rirong firmly guarded the rear, and were often able to intercept the opponent's passes. It was unwise to舍何 and use Liu Zemin. Soon after entering the game, he suffered several球數次. On the other hand, South China's forwards, Chen Xinqiu and Xiao Jiemin, made the most contributions. Xinqiu repeatedly used rotating positions to lie伏于 under the enemy's basket, and his shots were as quick as lightning. Jiemin, on the other hand, made even more outstanding plays. Although Pui Ying was strong, they were ultimately no match for their skillful passing. Shi Zhenzhi was originally South China's shooter, but he performed poorly in the match, so Xiao Chen had to make the contributions. South China later used Zheng Wokun and Qian Jinghui one after another, but they were not outstanding. As for the defenders Lu En and Shi Zhenda, they often went straight to the enemy's basket alone and made many contributions, but the rear was empty, and at the same time, they gave Pui Ying the opportunity to attack. Although South China wanted to 回師, it was too late. In the first half, South China was forced to tie twice, one reason being that the attack was too rushed. After adjusting the lineup in the second half, the attack and defense were much more meticulous, so they were able to gain the upper hand. After the two sides exchanged blows, Lu En of South China opened the scoring. Shi Zhenda followed with a long shot, and Shi Zhenzhi again hung the ball in with a backhand. Pui Ying only recovered three points through Lin Wanli. South China took the lead with 8-3. As soon as Qiu Guangxie shot and fouled, Wanli and Lianze successively made contributions, and they followed closely with 9-10. Subsequently, they tied the score at 16-16. Shortly after, Chen Xinqiu of South China托入 the basket at the bottom, and Shi Zhenda侧击 from the side of the court. Wanli and Jinhong of Pui Ying were not to be outdone and also recovered their scores. At the end of the first half, South China占先 by 20 to 20. After changing baskets, they again drew level with 10 to 20. By the time Xinqiu of South China entered the basket to unleash his might, the score became 36-26 and 40-28. Pui Ying fell further and further behind. Afterwards, Xinqiu's锐气稍挫, but Zhenzhi and Jiemin again露头角, and they won again with 49-34. Until the end of the game, Pui Ying was eventually defeated by South China by 34-56. In the last match, the Second Division Police faced Qingzhi. The two sides fought fiercely. As a result, the Police won by 41-34.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Women Under Oppression <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>"Do you think that these guys who exploit and oppress us in this way will have a good end?" Two pale-faced girls cursed as they stumbled downstairs, trembling so much that they could barely stand. What a tragic scene!</p>
<p>They were girls selling ice cream. Because they fled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, they could not endure the hardships of hunger and cold, so they took on this public-facing job on small steamers. The price they received each month was only ten dollars, and the working hours each day often exceeded nine hours. They also had to pay a deposit of five dollars and sign a six-month contract. In order to survive, no matter how difficult it was, they had to endure it. However, the boss was not satisfied with these harsh conditions and suddenly changed the employment system to a contract system. That is, the daily salary of thirty-three cents was changed to a commission of half a cent for every dollar's worth of goods sold, and the working hours were extended to more than eleven hours. This is something that an ordinary person cannot endure. Therefore, these two girls resolutely objected. After many quarrels, they finally managed to get back the seven-tenths discount on their deposits, but there were still dozens of girls who were in the same situation of oppression, without the conditions or ability to resist, and continued to be exploited.</p>
<p>How can they survive on a 毛錢 commission per dollar? Some people may be surprised to ask? In fact, there are too many similar incidents. A female worker in a weaving factory or flashlight factory often only earns half a 毛錢 to one and a half 毛錢 a day. If you work overtime, you get an extra half 毛錢. If the business is good and the orders are crowded, then you get one and a half 毛錢, and you have to work all night. After a few days of working all night, the boss will very kindly give you a few days of rest, but there is no salary during the rest period!</p>
<p>As times continue to evolve, the methods by which capitalists exploit hard-working workers are also constantly changing. They initially took advantage of the low wages of female workers, employing them with wages that were barely enough for them to live on. Later, in order to increase production, they adopted the contract system, which gave these female workers the idea of earning a little more money, and they命的 and worked with him. Finally, the capitalists felt that this contract system was not profitable enough, so they reverted to the employment system, employing these female workers with the lowest wages. Is this low wage enough to pay for housing and food? However, millions of miserable female compatriots continue to live like this. And many, many people are looking at the factory gates with envious eyes!</p>
<p>Hunger never forgives anyone for even half a second. In order to survive, in order for her whole family to live, if they have no work, they will only run on the last road,通 their lives to sell their flesh. Look at the prostitutes that are everywhere, and those escort agencies that are like stars in the sky? Where do these come from! In order to整饬市政 and prevent the spread of venereal diseases, the Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly reiterated the ban on suppressing secret prostitution and considering the abolition of escort agencies. However, the conclusion reached is that "starvation" and "prostitution" are only separated by a line. Therefore, the problem of "private prostitutes" is not a question of whether to eliminate them or not, but whether we want them to continue to live or not.</p>
<p>We are not saying that private prostitutes can never be eliminated. How to eliminate them? It is to enable everyone to have work and everyone to have food to eat. Now, the Labour Group of the YWCA is paying close attention to the problems of female workers. Setting up night schools to actively educate and train them is an important issue. However, there are no concrete measures to improve their lives. Of course, this is not an easy problem to solve. It requires the active assistance of the authorities and the combined efforts of enthusiastic people from all walks of life to achieve practical results!</p>
<p>The female compatriots who were liberated from the shackles of feudalism encountered this terrible oppression by capitalists. Therefore, female compatriots in the future must be more觉预起來, to relieve all玄 compatriots from the pain of being 壓炸!</p>

<h3 id="e50">Three Many <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Qianli</p>
<p>"Three Many" is the standard of living that most people desire, at least most Chinese people think so. Places like Hong Kong are currently gathering places for the wealthy, and the practice of polygamy is also very prevalent. There must be many people enjoying this "Three Many" blessing. However, the "Three Many" I am talking about here is not the three blessings of abundant fortune, long life, and many sons. On the contrary, it is the dark side of life.</p>
<p>That is: many cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, many prostitutes, and many thieves.</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the Hong Kong Department of Health, an average of more than 150 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis occur every week, and about 100 people die from it each week. A total of 52 weeks in a year, according to the report of the Department of Health, no less than 5,000 people suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis each year. This alarming number has forced the Hong Kong Department of Health to include it in the list of current diseases, and the public cannot help but feel uneasy. As a result, some people believe that such rampant situation is caused by ignorant people spitting everywhere, or they blame citizens for not knowing hygiene.</p>
<p>I think these gentlemen's opinions are very insightful, but in today's Hong Kong, where rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, and every inch of land is worth its weight in gold, how can ordinary middle and lower-class citizens, who are crowded into an apartment that can only accommodate a small family with three or four dozen people, talk about hygiene? This is something that deserves our attention. Moreover, according to the announcement of medical doctors such as those from Japan, the number of people suffering from lung disease in × country every year is no less than one million, and the number of deaths is also tens of thousands. The reason, it is said, is due to "lack of nutrition." It seems that the pulmonary tuberculosis in Hong Kong may not be unrelated to this aspect.</p>
<p>Secondly, the number of prostitutes is also very high. According to the report of the Salvation Army Commander, Mr. Burke Rice, at the Hong Kong Salvation Army Annual Meeting last month, more than 25,000 women in Hong Kong are forced to engage in prostitution due to economic circumstances, including many underage girls. In a city with a population of about one million, the number of prostitutes has reached such a figure, which is really surprising. Assuming that women account for half of the million people, the total is only 500,000. After excluding girls and old women, even if we assume that the age suitable for being a prostitute is from fifteen to forty years old, it is at most only half, that is, 250,000 people. Think about it, more than 25,000 out of 250,000 are prostitutes. Doesn't that mean that one out of every ten women of suitable age is a prostitute? What kind of ratio is this? I simply dare not think about it anymore.</p>
<p>In short, many, many, many, so many that it makes moralists cry out, and makes those men who have always looked down on women very proud. However, if you compare it with the recent robbery and theft cases, I am afraid it will still be insignificant.</p>
<p>Just open a corner of the newspaper and take a look, and you will immediately find that there is robbery there, and there is robbery there. Here someone is picking pockets, and there someone is picking pockets. Go to any public place or post office or boat station, and you will immediately see a few very eye-catching words: "Beware of pickpockets!" Otherwise, just run around on the street, and you can easily see some children snatching cigarettes, or stealing things from grocery stores or candy stalls. People call these "worthless" children "child bandits."</p>
<p>Alas, in addition to "child bandits," there are "child prostitutes," and in addition to child prostitutes, there are "child tuberculosis." These are the three major characteristics of Hong Kong. And the many thieves, the many prostitutes, and the many tuberculosis have become the "Three Many" of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>How to eliminate these "Three Many"? Some people say that this is "the decline of morality," so we must start with morality. Others say that this is "poor education," so we must strive to educate the youth. Still others say that this is because citizens "do not pay attention to hygiene," which is why there are so many cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, so we must promote hygiene. Everyone's words are reasonable and logical, but I only remember an old saying, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know shame." If clothing and food are insufficient and there is no way to make a living, it is impossible for citizens not to become prostitutes or thieves, and it is also impossible for citizens not to suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Who would be willing to stand on the street in the middle of the night, braving the cold wind and rain, and soliciting love from strangers, suffering all kinds of insults? Who would be willing to risk their lives, full of fear, just for a few dollars? And who would not cherish their body, willing to eat food without nourishment in a dark and airless room, causing their body to weaken and easily contract pulmonary tuberculosis? No one, no one wants to do this. As long as every citizen has enough food and clothing, these unpleasant "Three Many" will disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>But in Hong Kong, can this be done? Let's not talk about anything else, just take the rent as an example. From last year to now, the average rent has risen a lot. Among them, the rents of various houses under the jurisdiction of a certain bank, the largest landlord in Hong Kong, have increased by an average of more than 100%, and some have even increased by 200% or 300%. In such a situation of rising rents, just the rent alone is enough to force the entire city to become prostitutes, thieves, or tuberculosis patients. And this unreasonable rent increase is not prohibited in Hong Kong. This is why Hong Kong has become a place of "Three Many."</p>
<h3 id="e51">Breaking Free from Imprisonment <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>"Time" is like a stream. From here, I trace it back to the dangerous rapids, where rocks cut off the water flow. Thus, old dreams are separated from me, and I forget the calm waves, the peaceful banks, the green mountains on the river, and the tranquility of the ferry crossing. The rapid sounds of the rapids fill my ears, and the cliffs rise thousands of feet from the ground, forming an insurmountable barrier, blocking the sunlight. All around is vast and desolate, and I am imprisoned in a dark, deep pool. Coming from "yesterday," there are still faint traces of disappearing waves. I touch them with questioning hands: does the dark, rapid stream firmly seal this light boat, making seclusion and darkness forever?</p>
<p>"There are no continuous rapids, no eternal dangers, and no endless imprisonment." As if stepping over the green of the mountains, someone's voice is reminding me.</p>
<p>Wandering in an isolated environment, situated on a lonely island, the life in a water country for six months is like the setting sun sinking into the sails at dusk. Riding a light boat, stagnant at the head of the rapids, protruding reefs are scattered like stars, isolating the old flowing water, making me lose warm memories. Even in these dangerous rapids, it is impossible to linger. I feel the threat of change - the imprisonment of time and space.</p>
<p>Silently enduring, watching the fallen leaves intertwine in the soil, seeking warmth and hiding in the quilt, it is clear that the seasons are telling me that things are changing. On the withered branches, one or two new green shoots sprout. "It should be the spring of growth!" We must open the lock of light cold and open up the vitality of life. Spring, the season of growth, we can no longer hide in silence, confined to imprisonment, restricted under the eaves, enduring tyranny, submitting to shackles, surrounded by traps, and obeying the whip.</p>
<p>"Spring, the season of growth," every sinew is wriggling like a silkworm crawling on a mulberry leaf. Gradually, I feel that the inner strength needs to erupt. Black streams, black mountains, and black skies surround me, making it impossible to break free. Therefore, I will drive my light boat, cut through the dangerous rapids, from the reefs, from the sobbing waves, from the weeping banks.</p>
<p>Who can endure this cruel imprisonment—no freedom, no wandering, no crying or laughing, no sun, no warmth, no growth.</p>
<p>The wild cries of thousands of families, the barbarian songs in several places, the footprints of life, rolling in a few feet of square earth, closely connected to the edge of death, are so close and simple. The prisoners in brown clothes and shaved heads are locked in darkness and cold, their eyes are ashamed to see the light, and their bodies are abnormally sluggish. "Time" locks the old days, and "time" also cuts off the distance.</p>
<p>The lingering dream that wakes up often cannot be believed on the pillow. A piece of spring light leaks from the stone wall of the sky. Then I remember: the light smoke on the lake, the willow catkins of the river city, the meditation room deep in flowers and trees, the "countable rain" in the mountains when picking tea——</p>
<p>When I yearn for the beauty of wandering, someone whispers in my ear again: There are no continuous rapids, no eternal dangers, no endless imprisonment.</p>
<p>Cross the dangerous streams, cross the rapid water, cross the deep pool. Black wind, black mountains, black sky, pass by both ears, retreat behind me. Try to move a step to change the shape, and I see the shadows and rosy clouds, the morning mist and the rising sun.</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Art of Pushing <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Quanzhi</p>
<p>"The frost on his roof" can simply be "swept away by ten thousand brooms," which is great. However, "everyone should sweep the snow in front of their own door," which is a laborious task after all. So, it's not good not to sweep. What should we do? Well, you can "push" it to others: if you can't push it, you might as well learn how.</p>
<p>There are many ways to push: for example, if there is a house across the street, you can righteously announce to them that the snow is in front of their house and they should sweep it. If there is no house across the street, you can also confidently say to the left and right neighbors that the snow is near them and they should sweep it. If there are no neighbors on the left and right, you can even solemnly say to passersby that the snow is on the road they have walked and they should sweep it. If you can go a step further and prove that the snow fell because of these people, it will be even more justifiable to ask them to sweep it, making them have no choice but to obey. If you can go to the last step and prove that the snow was brought down by them, or brought by them from somewhere, then you can easily ask them to sweep it clean, achieving great success, and even if they die from sweeping, they can only die without complaint.</p>
<p>This method, "pushing" onto others, means pushing all the faults, mistakes, misfortunes, losses, and bad things onto others, while you are carefree, open and upright, and enjoy the fruits of their labor. How wonderful! Today, there are many great people with great careers, high positions, broad reputations, rich properties, and powerful influence, whether in the political, cultural, or business circles, or in any circle. A large part of the reason why they have reached this point is because they are proficient in this "push" principle.</p>
<p>When something comes into their hands, eyes, faces, or hearts, they never immediately deal with it. The first step is to see if it is beneficial to them. If it is not beneficial, they will "push" it away. They will not hesitate to use all their brains, spend all their thoughts, and exert all their energy to push this matter onto others, saying that it is not their responsibility. Even if it only requires a little brainpower, thought, or effort, saying that they can handle this matter, they are unwilling. They still have to push it away.</p>
<p>Of course, they are not born to be able to push, they learned it successfully. Maybe at first, they couldn't handle things without pushing, so-called "biting off more than you can chew." They learned this lesson, and since they are determined to establish their careers, they have no choice but to learn, to learn this "push." Over time, it becomes a habit, so there is no push that is not used, and no push that is not effective.</p>
<p>However, there are always exceptions: What if there is snow in front of your door, covering the ground, but there is no one to push it to, not even a passerby? Could it be that you really have to trouble yourself to sweep it in person? Well, you can still push it, push it to someone who doesn't exist, a Mr. Crow, a Ziluzi. In other words, all learning requires investment, which is never worthwhile. Since no one can be pushed for the responsibility of this snow, it is better to leave it there, ignore it, or pretend not to see it, let it melt by itself, let it freeze there. If you say that it is inconvenient to walk through the front door, you can simply go around the back door. If there is also snow on the back door, you can simply go through the side door, horizontal door, side door, or side door. There are many doors; you would rather put more effort into going around than to use a little effort to sweep, because one sweep will lose your dignity, will change your consistent policy, will destroy your unshakeable doctrine, and even if your shoes slip and your body falls, you will still not sweep, practicing your "push."</p>
<p>This kind of "push," when applied to all things, is procrastination. Pushing today to tomorrow, and pushing tomorrow to the day after tomorrow, and so on. If a bad thing turns into a small thing because of this "push," and a small thing turns into nothing, the pusher can congratulate himself on having foresight and avoiding disaster. If, because of the "push," nothing turns into a small thing, a small thing turns into a big thing, and a big thing is also unfavorable, he can also say, "Pushing is already like this, what would it be like if I didn't push?" Anyway, there are reasons for everything, and everything can be pushed.</p>
<p>This kind of pushing is also not something that can be achieved overnight. It also requires learning. Once learned, it is infinitely mysterious: it can avoid disasters, and it can turn bad luck into good fortune; at least to a limited extent, although there is no success, there is no failure either!</p>
<p>The above two kinds of pushing, the former is a "living push" that can be pushed away, and the latter is a "dead push" that cannot be pushed away. Combining the two, the art of pushing is almost complete.</p>
<p>Finally, we remember that there is also this "Confucius declined due to illness," which must also be learned. This is to tell lies, fabricate rumors, be shameless, and cheat people to death. When poor friends come to see you, you must pretend that you are not at home; when you have to serve as a soldier, you must pretend to be disabled; when you have to donate money, you must pretend to be poor; when you have to participate in patriotic movements, you must… have no time; if there is something in advance, you must pretend that it did not happen; when you are in a melon field, you must pretend to adjust your shoes, when you are under a plum tree, you must pretend to adjust your hat… Learning this push, you will have mastered the great achievements of the art of pushing, and you can be compared with Zai Yu, and be called the supreme sage in pushing!</p>
<p>However, when there is nothing to push, pushing the cart to a wall and getting your head broken is also a common occurrence. It seems that those who want to learn this also need to be careful.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Fengchuan Estuary (Continued) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wenhui</p>
<p>Some people pulled a long rope tied to the mast, dragging it step by step on the riverbank. The bare arms exposed from their sweaty clothes were extraordinarily bright red and strong in the morning sun. Their swarthy faces showed a kind of farmer's loyal and resolute expression, a sense of struggle. Our hands and feet were covered in blue veins from years of labor, and there were wrinkles on our foreheads: these were obvious traces of the hardships of life.</p>
<p>However, they were happy. Whether young or old, whenever they had free time, they would hold a large bamboo pipe, smoking it puff by puff, talking about the trivial matters of the countryside or the stories of their ancestors, and sometimes they would also talk about love affairs between men and women. They also loved to sing folk songs. They were conservative about life. Therefore, they loved the fields even more than their own lives. Among these partners, there were a few who had lost their homes and wives due to the bombing of × machines and had come to the boat to do this hard work. They often told of their experiences with a tone of resentment. Sometimes they would treat it as just an unfortunate fate.</p>
<p>The river water was even more turbid, and the boat often ran aground on the silt. Beads of sweat dripped from the foreheads and foreheads of the partners. They were a bit exhausted, and the boat was moving very slowly. It wasn't until we saw smoke rising from the villages that our boat arrived at the Fengchuan Estuary. This was the last border of Fengchuan County. The villages were separated far apart. I looked as far as I could on the deck, and the shore was completely a field of tea-brown land after autumn. On the edge of the sky was a desolate mountain with overlapping peaks. The sun was almost hanging in the sky. Our boat had stopped completely at this estuary, preparing to start making breakfast.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>

<p>— Shuqun</p>
<p>He seemed to want to cheer her up, hoping to find some funny material for her. So he said:</p>
<p>"No—"</p>
<p>"What else do you want to eat?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to eat anything—"</p>
<p>Although he said this as a joke, it was also the reality for him and his comrades.</p>
<p>"Why?" Her thoughts were completely focused on her hypocritical smile. She immediately said again, "Tell me!"</p>
<p>"It's very simple, no money!"</p>
<p>"Where's your money?"</p>
<p>"We've never had much to begin with."</p>
<p>"Then this time you must get a lot from my family, enough to eat well!"</p>
<p>"This money cannot be eaten!"</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>He replied humorously…</p>
<p>"This money is not for food, it's for fun!"</p>
<p>"Is someone sick?" She asked with a naked heart, "Is it very serious?"</p>
<p>"Very serious, almost dead. Don't you know?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Tell me. Who is it?"</p>
