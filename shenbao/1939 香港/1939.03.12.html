<h3 id="c1">對於戰後中等教育改革的幾點意見 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 張文昌</p>
<p>中等教育因在學制中段，其對象爲最活潑生動之靑年，其功能須兼顧普通教育與職業教育，其使命須使學生能升入高等教育機關，同時又須使之俱有正常健全之公民資格，態度，觀念與能力。這樣一來，中等學校就難辦了，在其他各國然，在中國更然。因爲教育爲社會機構之上層，其基礎爲政治，經濟與社會的一切狀况。</p>
<p>我國自採取西洋學制（前淸光緒二十八年，公曆一九〇二年）以來，近四十年於茲，學制屢更，效用鮮見，消極者流甚至以爲國家之貧弱，民生之凋疲皆由於教育之故；祇知消費，不事生產，只求表面，不尙實際之故。此種批評雖有一部份之眞理，但也不盡然。世上沒有一個國家政治與經濟不上軌道，而教育能獨自辦得好者，所以教育與社會息息相關，致談教育如何改革，須先看社會之趨勢如何，中等教育是全部教育之一環，當然亦不能外此。</p>
<p>戰後我國的狀况如何呢？我們不妨再預測一下。第一，我國神聖的抗戰必得到最後的勝利。第二，我國的政治必走上三民主義的共和政體。第三，我國的經濟必因大戰後而感到極度困難，需要國際的投資，政府統制的建設與開發，因而急需多方面建設的人才。第四，我國的教育與文化必因此次抗戰而更發達，而建立一個適應自己需要的教育制度，民衆教育與基礎教育（包括初等教育與中等教育）必更普及，高等教育必更實際深入，此爲必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>因爲戰後的中等教育必然有下列的趨勢：（一）學生數必更多，（二）一般家長經濟必更困難，（三）職業教育必更需要，（四）普通教育必更求熱練與效率之增加，（五）中等學校必普及於鄉鎭及小城市，故對於戰後中等教育之改革應注意下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，因學生數更多，原有校舍不够容納，且現有校舍已有不少被破壞，戰後復興，當然以後校舍之建築須通般籌劃。在質的方面但求堅固，不求富麗，在量的方面應顧到教室，圖書室，實騐室與操場之均衡，使教室的容量可以容得全校的數量。但圖書室實騐室與自習室及操場之容量，又可以容全校之數量。如是則可以試行葛雷制或柏勒通制，使一校可以容一校之學生，使在教室上課之學生與在圖書室，實騐室，自習室及操場之學生數量相等，使上課實騐自習與運動問相輪替。每室每場無空座，則可以容納加倍之學生。如此比現在滬港等地半日制學校使學生半天在家無聊者好得不知多少。且如此一來，不是單是符號認識與知識貫輸，有技能的訓練，更有體格的鍛鍊，有上課更有指導之自習，則應乎可稱爲完全的教育。第二，因一般家長經濟必更困難，故減低收費與加多公費免費與工讀學額外，更可推行學季制，以一牟分爲四李，除暑季六週作補習，其餘秋冬春三季，每季十四週。照本人去年五月至七月在華東聯合中學辦一短期實驗班之經驗，十四星期可以修畢普通一學期之學程。現行高初中六年之圓周制課程，殊多浪費與重複，例如史地，理科，算學，國文等教材頗多重複處，倘能重行編制，由淺入深，删繁採要，加入時代材料，編配學期二十週之材料於十四週中，注重練習，應用與實驗，則所得者，亦不致有生吞活剝之弊。前幾年國府要人中有提議廢置假期編短修學年限，前年教育部會令少數中學實騐六年中學五年完畢，縮短年限，人同此心。尤其在經費困難，需才孔急之戰後中國，用學季制以代學期制，則六年中學，四年可以完畢。如有少數程度低劣者，留級亦祇一季，時間亦殊經濟。再有一二科不及格者，更可在暑季中補習後補試。</p>
<p>第三，職業教育因建設孔急而更需要，故除高等教育之職業科外，中等學校亦需訓練大批職業界下幹部人員，但職業學校設備與師資非常難辨到滿意地步，此點可用半工半讀制度以救濟之利用工廠，農場，醫院之設備與技師，則設備與師資之困難可以解决。工廠得此學徒式之學生，則將來招收爲職員必更滿意而熟悉。學校內仍可有普通基礎科目，及職業理論科目，使學理與實際溝通。高級學生可以稍有工資或進益以彌補生活費，藉此減輕家長之負担。此種學校年限可以稍長，然經騐可以增加不少，畢業後不致除升學外別無辦法矣。</p>
<p>第四，普通學科在今日之中等學校中於國英算之基礎工具科目效能殊欠高，其故在目標龐雜，材料太深，練習太少，故有每况愈下之勢。其故除教材之選擇問題外，卽在自習時間之缺少與指導之不得當。甚至一無指導，如現行之半日制者。挽救之道，乃在實行嚴格精密之自學輔導。其法有二種：爲集中半日於輔導（另半天爲上課），排定主要科之自習時間，有專科教員分級分組巡迴指導，解答問題，練習指定，演習答題等等。高材生亦可派至各小組中作組長，負答較易問題，如此可使不及格學生減少，熟練而深入。一爲分科在課內自習，由原教員輔導原指定之作業，有上課時間稍長，劃分爲兩小節，上一級上課，下一節自修，如各四十分鐘或三十分鐘是。尙學科多而不及支配者可擇主要科，或甚至一星期定一二天實行之。有用五十分一節內，上課三十分至三十五分鐘，餘下廿分或一刻鐘作擇要之自習指導，使主要困難己在原教員指導下解决，則學生自習時已不若前之困難矣。</p>
<p>第五，中等學校不宜單集中於都市，鄉鎭村縣亦應普及，則使中等學生不必跋涉離家，同時學校亦熟悉鄉村社會情形而能適應。中等學校下鄉爲戰後必然途徑，方可使我國生機種於每個鄉村中。但有一困難，卽學生稀少，因我國鄉村是小村制，且初等教育尙未普及，故初設時亦宜選擇人口較密地點適中之鄉村或縣鎭設立之。學生不多，可用同學年之複式制或多學年之複式制，但組數不宣多至二組以上，則二種不同之程度，可在有經騐教員之指導下不浪費時間，問答義自修同時進行。且如行此制，則仍可招收春季生，與秋季生複式教學，不教因人少而發生困難。</p>
<p>未了，我們要知道，如何能實行上列改革端在教師之得人，今後我國教育不在改變制度與學制系統，而在師資之訓練與保持。教育部近設師範學院，給以五年之訓練，除普通科與基本教育科外，特重科與專業訓練，誠爲善策。人格訓練以導師制行之，則中等教育之改進可拭目而待。然此種人才訓練成功在數年之後，且未必卽能普及，故此後五年十年中，在職教師之進修，亦屬非常重要。顧一般在職教師對於進修恒不甚熱心，其求進步認識固屬一因，但困於家務與經費亦屬大原因，故自然學校預算內，應多加一個，半個，或三分之一教員的薪金，使每年或二年或每三年有一教員可輪替到師範學院之進修班進修一年，在離職期內，仍領原薪，則教員方面無後顧之憂，則學業之進取必更有效騐有質之教育行政者，以爲如何？</p>

<h3 id="c2">紀念民族革命之父——中山先生 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 晏彌</p>
<p>中華民族解放鬥爭的領袖，東方民族革命運動的導師，孫中山先生，離開我們，已經整整十四年了！任這十四年之中，國際形勢，固然已有重大的發展，中國狀况，更多驚人的變化，我們在今日追念中山先生舉生爲中華民族解放而奮鬥的事業，固不禁手舞足蹈狂歌興奮，然而中山先生艱苦締造傳給我們的中華民國，在×國主義和封建殘餘的內外交攻之下凋零破碎的情形，我們又將如何搥胸頭足負疚自責！但是現在抗日救亡的全面戰爭業經展開而且堅持了二十個月以上，中山先生畢生努力企求的團結全國各黨各派各軍各界建樹統一戰綫的理想業巳完成，中山先生積四十年革命經驗　成的三民主義，已被確定爲中華民埃革命鬥爭的最高原則；中山先生生留之際所拳拳不忘　其實現的三大政策和民主政治的理想，亦經全國一致認寫推進現階段中國革命與抗戰建國的最正確的政策；在抗戰轉向第二階段的今天，全中華民族的兒女們，正在繼承着中山先生的革命精神，爲完成中山先生禾竟之志，爲創造民唉獨立民權自由民生幸福的新中國而奮鬥，我們在這時候紀念中山先生的逝世十四週年，於無限的哀悼之下，又感到無限的奮勵！</p>
<p>（一）紀念中山先生的重大意義</p>
<p>我們今日紀念中山先生逝世十四週年，决非一般『悼死哀生」或「追憶先賢』所可比。</p>
<p>第一，我們要明瞭中山先生是中華民族的救星</p>
<p>辛亥革命以前的中華民族，是處在雙重壓迫水深火熱的環境之中，一方面滿淸封建黑暗勢力的堅迫。另方面是列强×國主義環伺交迫，企圖使中國淪爲完全的殖民地。這種危機正不知於蘇聯十月革命前帝俄時代的情形。中山先生獨能於此時綜合啓蒙時期革命思想和太平天國以來民族革命鬥爭的經驗與教訓，配台當時國際環境和國內的特殊條件。依仗其先知先覺，和堅强不屈的鬥爭决心，愈危愈厲的鬥爭精神，號召全國，奔走中外，親歷艱苦，糾合同志，團結友黨，推翻滿淸，建立民國，從內外變重危機下拯救出中華民族，因此我們稱中山先生爲中華民族的救星，是再確當不過的。</p>
<p>第二，我們還要認淸中山先生的三民主義是民族革命的最高原則。</p>
<p>推翻滿淸，解除了中華民埃的封建壓迫，這僅是革命的初步，要達到革命的理想，使中華民族永遠適存於世界而謀正常的發展，澈底做到全中華民族在國際上的平等，弁政治上的平等和在經濟上的平等，要澈底實現民族獨立民權自由民生幸福，所以便創立三民主義。同時爲使三民主義　現，又訂立了建國方略建國大綱，俾同志依一定方針一定步　，團結友黨友軍，領導全國民衆，共同努力。中華民國立國二十八年以來的歷史，証明了以三民主義創造新中國的止確性，實行三民主義則可救中國，叛離三民主義就只有滅亡。『世界革命之父』的列寧，使認定中山先生的三民主義，喊出了中國最廣大的人民大衆的最迫切也最根本的要求，稱之『爲數萬萬人的深刻革命運動所產生的思想。』我們每一個忠於民挨解放事業的中華兒女，都應該繼承這個偉大的思想，在新的環境與新的條件中去發展它。去實現它。</p>
<p>第三，我們要明瞭中山先生三大政策的時代意義</p>
<p>列寧在論到東方民族，論到中國民挨革命運動的時候，曾經鄭重地說：『我們看到這正偉大民族的眞正偉大的思想；該民挨不僅善於因自己的長期的奴隸狀況而痛哭，不僅善於理想自由平等，而且善於去向長期壓迫中國的人去鬥爭』！</p>
<p>中山先生便不僅是近代中國傑出的革命家與思想家而且是一個偉大的革命戰略家，他曾經規定了如何實現其偉大的思想與革命的目標的方針和道路，革命的三大政策（聯俄，聯共，扶植農工。），中山先生在臨終時的遺囑中說：『積四十年之經驗，深知欲達到此目的，必須喚起民衆及聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥』。又在致蘇聯革命領袖列寧的遺書中，更强調其熱烈的希望說：『不久卽將破曉，斯時蘇聯將以良友及　國而迎强盛獨立之中國』。中山先生並曾在民國十三年改組國民黨，不僅和共產黨訂立親密的統一戰綫，並且允許共產黨加入國民黨，十三年國民黨改組以後，革命運動飛躍發展，國民黨的威信與力量亦飛躍的增長，北伐戰爭長驅直下，所向無敵；後來國共分裂，情形卽爲之一變。這雖非中山先生所能預見，却是我們大家經歷過來的！這些經歷明白吿訴我們：中山先生的三大政策和統一戰綫的主張，實爲實現三民主義之唯一的正確的方法和道路，沒有三大政策和統一戰綫，就不會有革命的三民主義的實施。</p>
<p>我們民挨解放運動的領袖中山先生，雖然規定了勝利的戰略和道路，但是他已不及員見中國民族革命的成功而永遠離開我們！我們每一個忠誠於民族解放事業的都應該以繼續奮鬥實行中山先生所定戰略爲己任！</p>
<p>（二）新的環境和新的任務</p>
<p>新的環境和新的條件，已和中山先生領導我們爭求民族解放之時大大不同了，然而中山先生留給我們的革命的三民主義，芷確的三大政策，和中山先生本身的革命的精神和鬥爭的方法，却是永遠不朽地照耀在我們眼前，我們要怎樣用來配合新的環境新的條件來發展它實現它呢？</p>
<p>第一，抗戰已經進行了二十餘月</p>
<p>爲反對日本法西斯侵略，爭取中華民族的獨立自由幸福，實現中山先生的三民主義，我們已經英勇堅持抗戰二十個月以上，在這二十餘月中間我們表喪失了全國最重要的都市，我們犧牲了一百多萬優秀的兒女，我們遭遇到許多不堪想像的困難，但是我們已經殲滅了七八十萬日本精銳的部隊，我們消耗了等於日本全國財富總數的軍費，我們增加了日本侵略者前途不可挽救的困難，同時我們實現了二十餘年來未曾實現的全民族的團結，我們洗雪了近百年來對外屈服的民族恥辱，我們增長了在國際上的威信和同情援助，我們發見了堅持團結持久抗戰必勝的前送。</p>
<p>我們回念鉅大的創傷與犧牲，應該改正缺點弱點，益堅反抗到底再造河山的决心；我們眼看偉大的成功，應該提高民族的自尊心與必勝的信心，加緊政治淮步爭取最後勝利。我們今日在消極方面要追念中山先生過去堅决反對封建勢力反對剝削階級反對兩面份子反對失敗主義的精神，去掃蕩抗戰建國前途的這些障碍；我們在積極方面要追念中山先生平身主張，提高全民族的目尊心和自信心，動員全民族的生動力量，來推進抗戰建國到成功勝利之途。</p>
<p>第二統一戰線在強固發展中</p>
<p>抗日戰爭全面開展以來，我們首先慶幸領導中國民族革命最大政黨——國民黨和共產黨的由分而合，由此而開始實現了全國空前未見的鞏固的團結，抗戰廿月餘以來，國共兩黨和抗日各黨派的能够從×人和漢奸非常嚴重的阻礙與襲擊之下，實現更加親密無間的合作，使抗日民族統一戰綫，獲得繼續的鞏固與發展，使全民族抗戰建國的革命事業，獲得最後勝利的最大的保證，這種保證現在正由全世界以同情援華運動來加以承認。我們能够忠實執行中山先生給我們鄭重指示與曾經領導的道路，這是我們的光榮；然而十五年來的痛苦經驗亦應該教訓我們每一個從事民族革命事業的中華兒女，我們要明瞭國共合作和統一戰線，不僅是抗戰中的合作，可能而且必須是抗戰建國的長期合作，因爲祗有這樣才能保証抗戰建國的最後成功。同時目前階段的國共合作和統一戰線，尙嫌不够鞏團與發展，因此尙不能予×人以致命打擊，使其喪失進攻力量，便和我方發動反攻收復失地，因此我們今日更應以鞏固及發展國共合作和統一戰線，來紀念我們的領袖中山先生。特別是對於今日領導全民挨抗戰建國，領導我們鞏尚擴充國共合作與統一戰線的蔣委員長。更應致其偉大的敬禮與熱烈的擁護！</p>
<p>第三，親日妥協份子的淸除：</p>
<p>中山先生在領導全民族革命鬥爭中，曾以最嚴　坡堅决的態度來處置黨內一切動搖妥協叛變的份子，以最忠誠最坦　的態度來歡迎黨外人才參加及充實黨的力量，使國民黨從艱苦的鬥爭中迅迅成長起來。民國十三年的改組，更可作為全世界民族革命鬥爭中健全革命陣營的模範。現在蔣委員長領導三民族抗日革命戰爭，當其發現黨內少數腐敗頑固目私自利親日妥協份子之時，立卽以最嚴肅最堅决態度加以淸除；如叛徒汪精衛的開除黨籍，引起全國輿情熱烈擁護。同時蔣委員長對於黨外人才亦以大公無私的態度，鄭重地掖引借助親密合作，更爲中外輿情一致頌贊。今日紀念中山先生，便要明瞭孫中山先生此種態度，更要擁護持委員長這種態度，尤其是在此若干親日漢奸妥協份子繼續潛伏活動破壞團結抗戰之際，我們要更加　重認眞地學習中山先生和蔣委員長。</p>
<p>第四，抗戰新階段的特點</p>
<p>抗戰現階段的特點是正由×優我劣的形勢劇激轉向×我勢均力×的形勢，是由第一期進入第二期，由退守的第一階段，轉向相持的第二階段，和準備反攻的第三階段，在這階段，×人國內國際的困難正在日益增加，以至於不能補救的階段，同時我們則愈戰愈　，國內及國際的形勢亦愈趨有利，漸漸逹到停止×人進攻，發展我軍反攻的階段。但是同時要知×軍進攻實力尙未全部消失，新的最殘酷的進攻正在積極推進，破壞我全國團結持久抗戰的「反共』停戰陰謀同時繼續進行，中華民族滅亡的危機尙未過去，我們紀念中山先生，要以中山先生四十年奮團不屈不撓的精神云克服新的困難，最後戰勝日×。</p>
<p>第五，國際現勢的趨向</p>
<p>最近國際形勢是更明顯地分成兩大陣綫，一面是法西斯侵略陣綫，日德意三國在『反共』協定的子下，積極推進進攻英美法重新分割世界的大戰：另一方面是民主和平陣綫，民主和平的資本主義國家統治者難在繼續妥協退讓。但是美國政府已在法西斯更瘋狂的威脅下響應蘇聯號召民主和平各國聯合制裁獨裁的侵略的國家，而全世界廣大民衆更在積極建立鞏固與發展反法西斯反侵略的陣綫。我們現在抗戰，正做了反法西斯反侵略鬥爭的前鋒。我們今日更應依照中山先生遺囑『聯合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奮鬥』，特別是聯合世界和平柱石的蘇聯，聯合民主國家的英美法等，鞏固荷和平陣綫，抗反抗法西斯反侵略勢力，爭取民族解放和世界和平。</p>
<p>（三）怎樣紀念中山先生</p>
<p>我們已經依據新的環境和新的條件，提出了我們如何發展與實現中山先生思想與革命理想的辦法，指山當前爭取抗戰建國的成功與實現中山先生三民主義的道路，我們還要提出怎樣紀念中山先生逝世十四週年的問題。而下面三點，應當是我們對於各自最低限度的要求。第一，要學習中山先生的革命精神</p>
<p>中山先生爲了領導全民族實現中國的獨立自由，英勇奮鬥了四十年，他以全部精神力量交給民族解放民族革命的偉大事業，直至彌留之際，仍諄諄以繼續完成其遺志，　其黨員和全國民衆。而且中山先生一生，從反對腐敗黑暗的滿淸專制政府開始其革命的事業，經過反對食橫殘暴的軍閥統治及國際×國主義的侵略，在中山先生這樣終生如一日的英勇的鬥爭中，其堅持不懈，其臨危不屈，其遇難不辭，其捨身爲國，其廉潔無私，其對勞苦羣衆的極懇切的同情，其對壓迫者剝削者的極深刻的仇恨，在在都足以爲我中華民族高尙精神與英勇氣慨的圓滿的體現，在在都足爲今日爲民族解放事等而努力的戰士與男女靑年的模範。</p>
<p>第二，要爲澈底實現革命的三民主義而奮鬥</p>
<p>什麼是三民主義呢？中山先生所訂的「國民黨第一次代表大會宣言」。曾經明確地吿訴我們：</p>
<p>『（一）民族主義：國民黨之民族主義有二方面之意義，一則中國民族目求解放，二則中國境內各民族一律平等，第一方面；國民黨之民族主義，其目的在使中國民族獨立自由於世界。……第二方面，……國民黨敢鄭重宣言：承認中國以內各民族。自決　，於反對帝　主義及軍關之革命獲得勝利以後，要組成一自由統一的（各民　由聯合的）中華民國。</p>
<p>（二）民權主義：國民黨之民權主義……凡真正反討×國主義之個人及團體。均得享有一切自由及權利，而凡賣國岡民以効忠於×國主義及軍閥，無論其爲團體或個人，皆不得享有此等自由及權利。</p>
<p>（三）民生主義：國民黨之民生主義，其最要之原則不外二者，一曰平均地權，二曰節制資本。……農民之缺乏田地，淪爲佃戶者，國家當給以土地，資其耕種，幷爲之整頓水利移植荒郊，以均地力，農民之缺乏資本至於高利借貸，以負債終身者，國家爲之籌設調劑機關，如農民銀行等，供其匱乏，然後農民得享人生應有之樂。……　工人之失業者，國家當爲之謀救濟之道，尤當爲之制定勞働法以改良工人之生活。此外如養老之制，育兒之制，周恤殘廢者之制，普及教育之制，有相輔而行之性質者，皆當努力以求其實現。凡此皆民生主義之所有事也。』</p>
<p>我們囘憶北伐戰事發展之神速所向無敵者，其主要原因厥爲軍隊充盜着革命精神，農工民衆一致協助，而其根本原因，就在革命的三民主義的宣傳鼓動，尤其是爭取農工民衆政治上經濟上平等地位的口號及其革命的　領，我們在此爲實地抗戰建國最後勝利而奮鬥的階段，自史應以『澈底實現革命的三民主義』相號召，以求國際地位的平等，政治地位的平等和經濟地位的平等，以求實現民族獨立民權自由民生幸福。</p>
<p>第三，爭取第二階段抗戰勝利的必要條件</p>
<p>中山先生在領導拯救中華民族的鬥爭中，積舉生鬥爭經騐而爲我們指示出的鬥爭方針和道路，就是偉大的三大政策和統一戰綫的主張，我們今日新的環境和新的條件，更迫切需要澈底實現中山先生的三大政策和統一戰綫的原則，我們紀念中山先生，必須努力發展和實現這個原則。具體的說起來，我們今日必須集中一切力量，在政治上要實行：（一）擁護蔣委員長，擁護國民政府，擁護國共合作，反對分岐與分裂，反對任何的漢奸傀儡政權（二）實行集中領導下的民主政治，密切政府與人民的聯，發揮抗日政權的最大能力；（三）擴大統一的民衆運動，全力援助戰爭；（四）團結中華各族漢，滿，蒙，囘，藏，苗，　，夷，平等權利『共同抗日』建立統一的國家，（五）勵行鋤奸運動，鞏固前綫與後方；（六）發展國共兩黨及抗日黨派，强固統一戰綫，堅持長期抗戰。其次在軍事上，（一）提高主力軍的戰鬥力，保衛華中華南與西北，停止×之進攻；（二）擴大發展×後方游擊戰爭，創立和鞏固我之根據地，縮小×之佔領地，配台主力軍作戰；（三）提高軍事技術，創立機械化兵團。準備反攻實力。又次在經濟方面，（一）實行新的戰時財政經濟政策；適應抗戰建國新的需要；（二）改良民衆生活，激發民衆抗戰熱忱典生產熱忱。又次在文化方面，（一）高度地發揚民族自尊心自信心，堅持抗戰到率，克服悲觀失望情緒，反對妥協企圖（二）實行抗戰教育政策，使教育爲持久　抗服務，創立並擴大增强各種幹部學校，培養大批抗日幹部，廣泛發展民衆教育，提高人民的民族文化與民族覺悟。此外在對外關係上，我們要實行：（一）力爭國際的援助，聯合以平等待我的蘇聯，聯台英美法等民主和平國家，集中力量××日本×國主義，（二）建立中國與日本兵民及××××等×××××的反侵略統一戰綫，共同反×××××××。</p>
<p>當此中華民挨解放戰爭劇烈進行的新階段。當此國際形勢激劇轉趨於我有利的新階段，我們紀念民族解放門爭的領袖東方革命的導師，我們應該學習他的堅苦卓絕的革命史蹪，我們應該高舉他的代表我們偉大民族偉大思想的三民主義之旗，我們應該忠誠地運循他的三大政策，鞏固和發展抗日民族統一戰綫，齊心合力去驅逐全民族全世界的公×，迎接獨立自由幸福的中國與眞正和平的世界！</p>
<h3 id="c3">總理的偉大 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 河</p>
<p>今天，是我們的國父孫中山先生逝世十四週年的紀念日。凡是中華民國的國民，飲水思源，應該不要忙記艱難創造這中華民國的孫中山先生。凡是中華民國國民，得應熱烈地來紀念孫中山先生開始建立中華民國的苦心與意義，堅决地執行孫先生革命的三民主義和孫先生所主張的三大政策。</p>
<p>剛才我讀總理遺囑至『以平等待我之民族』一語，心裏有着無限感觸，此次英國之對我極力帮忙，最近且以鉅款助我，足知正義的國家，决不怕沒有人不同情的。我還記得，孫先生當年致力革命的情形，我也很淸楚記得，孫先生彌留時所可嚀我們的談話，孫先生不是一個有軍隊的人，也不是一個當時滿淸政府的官員，更不是一個富有財產的人，而只是一個中產人家的干弟——醫學學的靑年學生，我知道他因爲學醫，具有悲天憫人的心，擴大醫治個人的慈心，遂有醫人醫國的壯志，從而醫治飽受滿淸帝制壓迫和摧殘的中國人民大衆，當時滿淸帝制的政治雖然腐敗，到了對內壓迫人民大衆，對外喪權辱國，然而那統治勢力，還殘存奮，作威作福。悉索敝賦，弄至民不聊生。先生本着他那無大長的精紳，經過十次的失敗，仍不屈不撓，卒能推翻數千年來阻碍進化的帝制統治，來創造這個獨立自由的中華民國。可是，因爲那時的對建殘餘，還沒有肅淸，于是造成了多年來的軍閥割據局面，同胞互相摧殘，人民困苦，不减滿淸帝制統治之時，先生洞悉國情，在民十三年時，具體提出三民主義與三大政策——聯俄，聯共，扶助農工，後因當年的軍人，不能悉遂教令，先生遂來心北上，擴大宣傳，取消不平等條約，道經日本，洞悉侵略者之陰謀，固决心抵抗，我們後死的同胞，讀其遺囑，可以了解了。後以舟車勞頓，舊症復發，于是年冬病勢轉趨沉重，而南北統一未成，先生遂于十四年前的今日，將其未竟之志，付託後死的革命同志，先生的呼吸，也就隨着他的叮囑——和平奮鬥救中國而停息了。</p>
<p>他死那個時候，我記得有三張遺囑：一張是遺給後死的革命同志，要同志們繼續努力，共同奮鬥；一張是遺給孫夫人的；一張是還給蘇俄，希望中蘇兩大民族。在先生死後，能够切實聯合。當時在場圍着先生的人，有許多革命同志，這些同志，現在巳經有些在執行先生的遺囑，領導抵抗暴×；可是有些在這艱難的途程中，却走到反革命的道路去了，高唱什麼與侵略　　妥和平了，這些人所講的話，還像是先生的革命同志所說的嗎？不僅不是先生的同志，籣直這中華民族的叛徒，連中國人本性也沒有了。我還記得，在先生在南京就臨時大總統那時，有人對先生獻議，對于外來的內在的×人，不用處置過激，先生當時卽答之曰：『我們的宗旨就是革命。對外國家不能求得獨立自由，對內人民的生活不得到解决，那我們何用致力革命呢？』這幾句話，我還很淸楚記在腦裏，我也很明自。時刻拿來測量我的行動，看看有沒有違反先生革命的主張。我也記得在三十六七年前先生第二次由擅香山再到日本，開始組織同盟會時，我和廖仲愷先生也加入，先後加入的留學生，也有十七省了。其時先生提出的民族主義，驅除韃虜，恢復中華民族的獨立與自由，提出民權主義，求得中國國內各民族一律政治地位平等，創立民國，是創立民主的共和國，提出民生主義，平均地權，解除人民的痛苦生活，先生這種革命思想，我因爲跟他很接近，所以我對于他的革命主張的了解很透切。　以下轉入第三版</p>

<p>— 何香凝</p>
<p>同時光生革命的熱情，也很高漲，我們跑各地的華僑受他的感深，也特深入。所以，在今日抵抗侵略者的民族解放戰爭，正在轉入一個新的有利階段之際，可是我們是一個廿餘年來政治混亂的一個國家，艱難的前途，是我們估量得到的。但是，知己知彼，我們的責任，是重大的，我們的的作，是要一刻不應怠慢的，我們的力量，是要集中的，我們今天紀念先生，我們應切實執行先生遺給我們的革命三民主義和先生堅决主張的三大政策——聯俄，聯共，扶助農工。</p>
<p>凡爲中華民國的人民，中山先生的革命同志，有良心的人，都應担負起實現先生革命的未竟之志。我們爲着實現先生的民權主義，必要剷除各地的實官汚吏，和罔上欺下的公務人員，早日實現各地方的參議會，使到人民大衆得到對于政府執行抵抗侵略者的主張，貢献更具體的意見，使得全國各民族各黨派各階層的人民力量，完全匯築在政府抵抗侵略者的主流中去；使到一些力量，都不會白費掉；××××××××。求得民族解放戰爭的最後勝利，建立三民主義的共和國，達到民權主義的眞正實現。</p>
<p>先生是一個悲天憫人的人，他對于那些涅着威勢壓迫他人的人，地是深惡痛絕的。所以地從世界的新政治潮流的研究所得，提出這個民生主義。，他要把這主義澈底實現，使到人人得到做人的地位，使得人人得到衣食住行的生活資料。但是現在侵略者，想要滅亡我們中華民族，想要把我們做人的地位降到做牛做馬，做十五世紀時代的奴隸一撈的地位，侵略者的眞面目，我們也很認識了，××××××××，……那麼，就要我們今天在進行紀念先生的同志，同胞，飲水思源，應該深切了解先生的革命的三民主義與三大政策的眞義所在，拿着個人的私見，來阻止實施或是沒有勇氣來去全部實施，××××××，那就無異把我們的解放戰爭，弄得更感困難。這些都是抗日戰爭的病象，我們應該大聲疾呼，必須糾正過來的。</p>
<p>最後，我還有一些話，所要說的：中華民國所以能够建立。在我的觀點看來，孫先生的不斷奮鬬的精神、是其一。我們今天紀念先生，在這艱難困苦的民族解放的革命戰爭途程中，先生這種奮鬬的精神，值得我們人人切實學習的。中華民國的建立，全國人民能够得到解除帝制壓迫的痛苦，係當時先生與一般革命志士的肯犧牲流血，抱不成功，則成仁的决心，所以能够更廣泛引起全國有志之士起來響應參加，此其二。××××××，我們紀念先生，應該人人起來抱着犧牲决心，參加救國工作×××××持久抗戰，擁議抗戰到底，爭取最後勝利。又我記得，當同盟會成立後，就派出許多同志到各地勸捐，華僑之毀家捐金者，此呼彼應，其後，中華民國得以建立，華僑之力，實佔三分之一；今天，我們紀念先生，更應該知道，締造中華民國的艱難，各地華僑，尤應記得當時響應先生革命此種毀家捐金的勞績，繼續獻金，使這一次××戰爭，得到更多的經濟援助。同時對于軍事工業的建立，國防經濟的發展，華僑們也應全力協助，使到政府得到抵抗××者的一切資源，同時對於自己的私產的蓋積，不論官民，應得反省，有無發國難財的意味，大家自己問間良心，而今滿目瘡痍，自已也能視若無覩麼？假如國家亡了，就是有私財，也沒有用的，猶太人目私的結果，就是我們一個好的警惕的換樣，我們今天多出點財，獻給國家，救濟難民，和那在前綫受傷歸來的戰士。我們紀念先生，我們須嬰學習先生的奮鬬的革命的，廉潔的，大公無私的仁慈的精神，完成民族解放的大業，建立一個獨立自由的現代國家。</p>

<p>英國全國援華大會，於前日（十日）晚起在倫教舉行，情况異常熱烈。我們認爲特別值得注意的是：</p>
<p>第一，約克主教在大會致詞，對於我國人民抗日的英勇鬥爭，表示絕大的敬意，這裏可見我國堅持抗戰。不僅提高我國在國際的地位，使國際上認淸我國抗戰同時是爲保衛世界和平，增加國際的同情援助。</p>
<p>第二，，約克主教並大聲指山：『有組織之列強，至今仍不能設法終結彼等之苦難，余實爲之羞恥』顯爲針對妥協外交的悲憤的賣問。不過我們要正吿世界，我們固然深謝國際上希望終結我等苦難的崇高的用意，但是除了給予侵略者殘殺者以有效制裁以外，實無其他可以終結戰禍的途徑可循！</p>
<p>第三，大會主席菲利小姐特別指出遠東侵略者進攻中國，對於英國人民生命的嚴重威脅，她還說：『倘日本得勝、人類五分之一，卽將成爲半奴隸之人！』此　警語。當非危言聳聽，可見英國人民，已在漸漸覺醒了！</p>
<p>國際上演大人民大衆，已經幷且正在擴大援華運動，以履行每個人在人道與正義上應負的貴任，我們全國同胞，尤其是倖免於炮火之災的海外僑胞，曳應如何檢束一切無謂的消耗，爲拯救組國的苦難而呈献一切力量啊！</p>

<h3 id="c31">納粹的飛騰虐政 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 世長譯　Harold　Callender原著　載二月號『現代史料』</p>
<p>在德國，人民對於政治的批評。是很不容易聽到的，因爲他們都被迫的據護希特勒，根本不能有絲毫不滿的表示。在任何地方，秘密警察都很忠心的行施職務，竊聽電話，拆閱信件，對於可疑的人物，更是嚴密的監視着。德國的人民，都知這官方密探遍地皆是，所以，除了無關緊要的通話以外，都避免應用電話，以去除種種麻煩，但是，他們很知道德國現在所經行的路程，並且一再的表示，希望外國能够壓制納粹的「爆炸」。</p>
<p>納粹的德國，自　　力强大，嚴厲的抨擊英美；可是，國內的不安和疑懼，到處顯露着。外國也漸漸的不相信德國的自誇，在目前，德國認爲可以鎭壓國內的不滿；國外的反對，暫時可以不必顧盧。</p>
<p>最近我到過德國，行經西南東北的十大城市以後，得到一些印象：德國各地人士，甚至於納粹階級的人，對于十一月暴動事件（按指排猶運動——譯者），和借德國人民的名義所做的事情，多表示震駭，不滿和羞恥。他們深切的痛恨官方聲言，排猶行爲是出自德國民意的自然舉動，同時，看到最近事件的演變，對於德國的將來，發生了驚惶，他們希望外國對德採取較爲强硬的態度，他們知道自己是無能作爲的，因爲，納粹的權力太强暴了，如果他們有所不滿，無疑的，必定還受監禁。</p>
<p>德國的人民，一致痛恨戰爭，同時，他們相信，如果德國參加了一種戰爭，一定時期很短，因爲，德國人民都不願戰爭，而且，納粹的統治，也許因爲戰爭，而有消減的可能。所以希特勒的最大成功，是不戰而勝，不戰而逹到所企求的目的。這樣一。德國國力一天一天的增强，德國的人民，非納粹黨的官吏，卽使是深恨　內暴政的人，也都感覺欣喜，因爲這是未經戰爭而獲得的勝利。可是納粹外交政策的危險是不能忽視的，這些危險以經有許多實現了。</p>
<p>天主教徒被迫停止兒童向天主教學校上學；新教牧師的薪倖，也爲當局大大的减低，並且，更準備拒絕給付；教會的財產和房屋，將被沒收；教會稅仍舊繼續徵收，應用到非宗教的事業上；教會牧師將有被這捕，加以陰謀革命罪的危險，天主教是大受納粹的攻擊了。</p>
<p>德國人最感覺煩惱的是糧食的缺乏，他們多是不願犧牲牛油，而造大炮的，每人每星期紙能食牛油四分之一磅，鷄蛋是極少的，品質較好的食物，是不能得到的；面包似乎比一年前白了一些，可是，據有識的主婦說，貿地是更加的低劣了，德國各地的人民，對于無理的稅收，強迫的捐欵，莫不怨聲載道的。</p>
<p>爲了擴充軍備，德國的各方面都在緊縮。尤其是對於廚房和餐室，是有很大的影響的。在德國的大飯店和大酒家裏，德國人所能得到的食品，不能像一個軍力較弱的小共和國內飯館所能供給的那麼好；可是，他們明明知道國家儲有各種豐富的食品，德國人的胃口也是不自由的，德國對待外國人的俏形，就有些不同了。外國人在德國的大旅館裏，每天可以有四分之一磅的牛油——德國人每星期所能得到的數量——，和善的外國人，必定在室內，請他的德國朋友一同進食，同時，更在餐後，用油衣句紮牛油，放在他朋友的衣袋裏，這樣，他一定會受到大大歡迎的！</p>
<p>德國的新鮮水菓也非常缺乏，雖然，儲藏的水果，對於外來旅客所需求的，還能够應付，懂得這些事情的婦女們說，許多水果攙雜裝槍，以救演續的缺乏，所以鮮果就不多了。</p>
<p>如果一位外國人，跑出一家舒適的德國旅館，自己組立了一個家庭，他一定會發生糧食上的問題，不能得到美味滋養的食品。主婦們都怨言牛油，鷄蛋，鮮葉，靑菜，麥，麵粉，糖等的缺乏，勞工階級婦女更覺得食品的昂貴，肉類是不敢問津的。</p>
<p>德國人歡喜還種生活嗎？當然不是的；可是，這是沒有多大關係的，德國人是根本不能管理德國啊！</p>

<h3 id="c45">中山的糧荒 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>本報特寫中山縣是一個糧食充裕的地方，除掉了佻給本縣而外，還可以調劑鄰縣的不足，大致上說來，中山縣不會鬧糧食恐慌的，然而現在竟然鬧着絕糧的恐慌了，這是一個非常值得注意的問題。</p>
<p>緊隨着廣州的失陷，虎門的被圍，中山縣是處在一個怎樣的風雨飄搖當中，爲了廳付事變的來臨，當地政府採取了一切必要的防禦步驟，疏散谷米，也是其中的。大者，這時正當晚造登塲，谷米鹽收，突受這種意外的打擊，長民們都紛紛將收獲谷米，趕速推出；米店米商，自然也是不敢大量的存儲，在這種供過於求的情形下，中山的米糧，眞是低賤萬分，每百担祗售那麼六塊錢，鄰鄉鄰邑，都紛來採購，就在這時間發現了某某兩大家的米業公司，把這種平賤的谷米，盡量吸收而運出內地，照當局頒佈提倡國米，以塞漏扈的法例說來，這是一種悖理的，違法的舉措，然而，他們就能運用他們的手腕，使得國米暢然外流。「保存谷米，免資×糧」，這是一個多麼堂皇而又巧妙的藉口啊！</p>
<p>侵犯廣州的×人，有點感到勢窮力蹙，而沒有餘力窺伺別的地方了，中山縣就在這種情形之下，漸漸安定下來了。朔冬纔過，又是陽春，中山縣經一度大疏後而尙存少量的谷米，已漸漸吿聲，米源短絀，米價自然騰漲，由一塊錢七斤米而漲到五斤，現在還有向上趨之勢。鄰邑鄰縣的情况，更是不堪聞問，一般中下人家，莫不叫苦連天，事實上很多連飯的味見都不嘗了很久，每天祗就吃那簿薄的雜糧渡日。那種慘苦的情况，幷非筆畢所能够形容的，假如遷延下去，一个月後，中山全縣便會絕糧的了！</p>
<p>爲了這件嚴重的事件，中山縣的戰時糧食委員會，經過縝密的籌商下，便電請財部，豁免洋米入口稅，一方面則派出李德聯，何錫　等五個委員到香港來，向僑港邑人呼籲，請中山僑商會將義倉存欵，和濟難會的存款，撥出來廣購洋米，運赴中山，舉辦平　，以維民生。目下這幾個委員已到了香港，已經和中山僑港商會的負實人接洽過，大約等候明天星期一召開會議，纔能够切賓决定這件事。</p>
<p>同時第一區行政專員古鼎華也曾爲這個問題，召集了九縣的縣長，會商應付這件事的方策，大致决定一方面電請財部核免洋米入口稅，一方面飭　各鄉各縣，設法自辦平　，這當然是一個治急的方法，希望僑港的同胞，對這個嚴重的事件能給以有力的援助！</p>

<p>『雕開玉砌嗎猶在，只是朱顏改』。當我們踏進淪陷區名勝影展會場的時候，那一慕幕的珍貴往事，　驀地裏闖進記憶的領域……但我們沒有眼淚，亦沒有悲傷，有的是咬緊牙根，還有的是握緊拳頭。</p>
<p>香港婦女兵災籌賬會主辦的淪陷區名勝影展，於昨天起一連三天弁花園道聖約翰禮堂舉行。絡繹前往參觀的，都知道這並不是來玩賞藝術品，而是來憑吊血淚的痕跡。現在消沉地，頺喪地唱着『流亡曲』，那是弱者的呼聲，只有挺起胸膛，打囘老家去才是生路！</p>
<p>全場四百九十一幀，琳琅滿目，都是鐵　氏的精心傑作。所獵影的淪陷區計有北平，塞外長城，天津，濟南，泰山曲阜，南京，霞棲，鎭江，無錫，蘇州，杭州，上海，及廣州等處。</p>

<h3 id="c48">由新歌劇到新國劇 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 胡春連</p>
<p>在中國，話劇是異邦的移植品，歌劇却是唐朝以來的國粹。它做爲戲劇的正統，做爲主要的民衆娛樂，巳經有了這樣的長久歲月，其對於民衆的影嚮必然是異常巨大的，民國以來，進步的智識分子致力於話劇的介紹與建設的很多，可是提起歌劇，就認爲是落伍和反動的東西，不值一談，結果，歌劇的革命被延緩了，殘餘封建勢力得到了多一種的支持，話劇在普遍化的路途受到障礙，而新國劇的建立，前途也更其遙遠。</p>
<p>抗戰開始以後，文化救亡工作者對於這擁有廣大的聽衆的歌劇才開始注意起來，於是內容的改造，伶人的訓練都開始被實踐着。舊戲的革命和救亡戲劇運動的展開配合着，歌劇工作者和話劇工作者共同參加了中華戲剿界的統一陣綫，在抗戰建國的歷程中，必能築起新國劇的基礎。</p>
<p>我們要從這個觀點來進行討論『從新歌劇到新國劇一。</p>
<p>唐宋的戲曲是中國戲劇的襁褓時期。到元朝，中國戲劇開始長成了。元曲那種原始的力量，溥厚的氣魄，通俗的形式，多樣的內容，普遍的影響，是可與任何一個國度，任何一個時期的戲劇比美的，明曲在藝術上說是比一元曲進步了，他精密化，古典化了。由五折變爲四十齣，這劇烈的變化是文學史上的奇蹟。可是另一方面，他却遠離了大衆而走進了宮廷，在民衆方面廣泛的藝術活動　成了靜的文學作品。</p>
<p>爲了這，亂彈才從傳奇的系統裏蛻變出來呈現着要求解放的趨勢，西皮二黃秦腔正是明曲的野生的對立物。到了民國初年，被宮廷祭養成了馴順的玩品的西皮二簧也起了革命，大衆對於新的物事的追求，使梅蘭芳也不能不演起「一縷麻」，「一剖腹驗花」之類的改良京戲了。</p>
<p>「本戲」（卽自成首尾的故事而不是小設的片段）的要求加强了，於是在北方，有合於梅蘭芳氏上演的有歌有舞的新戲；在南方，有掦溢着反封建情緒的歐陽倩予氏創作的『人面桃花』，『『潘金蓮』，『劉三妹』。</p>
<p>最足以說明這要求的是漢調和粵曲的增長與變革，尤其是粵曲，全新的平喉調子，易唱易聽的劇詞，有頭有尾的故事，都是現社會需要的，至少是可能接受的。可是同時，中西樂的摻雜，古今服裝的薈萃，庸俗的詼諧，機關佈景的濫用，凡是這些低級的，不合理的爲世所詬病的現象，都是在轉形期中的反常的表露，這證明了新歌劇還沒有建立，同時也指示出新歌劇必須建立。</p>
<p>機械和舞台技術之發逹，促成了屬歌劇的崩潰和新的試驗的開始。而民族的解放運動更加深了她的政治醒覺和指定了新的線路。</p>
<p>舊瓶子裝新酒的抗日歌曲，粵劇在街頭的演出，歐陽予倩氏，田漢氏的試騐如『桃花扇』，『梁紅玉』，『新雁門關』，都是表現了新的內容在要求新形式，新酒一定會漲破了舊瓶子。</p>
<p>到現在，戲劇的革新更有必要，也只有現在，戲劇的革新最有可能。在大時代的號召之下，新現實的要求中，毆劇也必然有着劇烈地變革，我們可以斷定，新歌劇的產生必和抗戰健國偉業同時完成。</p>
<p>話劇中國化，歌劇現代化，它的交叉點就是新國劇的建立，在這途程中，我們可以規定斯歌劇的內容與其形式：</p>
<p>一，新歌劇的內容必然是意識蛾攝取古今的社會現實，服務抗戰建國，培育向上，　爭，仁愛的民族精神，它一定會是反侵略反壓迫（在現階段是反法西斯）的鬬爭的紀錄。</p>
<p>二，新歌劇必須具有有機的組織，以有頭有尾的故事，科學的組織，渲染一種主要形式，</p>
<p>三，新歌劇的表演會是『更人間的』。那完全舞踊式的表演，只能做爲高一種形式的參攷。</p>
<p>四，演出的舞台方面是更科學的，需要一切現代藝術的條件。</p>
<p>五，音樂一定由中樂改用西樂。</p>
<p>六，新歌劇與話劇和電影更爲接近，它是多樣化的。</p>
<p>爲了大衆的精神食糧，爲了抗戰的勝利，我們要努力於新歌劇的寫作與演出、促成新國劇的建立！</p>
<h3 id="c49">從舊劇改革運動談到金素琴 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 歐陽予倩</p>
<p>奮劇改革運動，兩年以來才被承認爲中國戲劇連動的一個部門，但因爲從事這個運動的同志太少，所以還沒有展開，八一三以後文化界注意到出舊戲作宣傳的必要，才從新將舊戲加以評價、去年在武漢組織戲劇界救亡協會，長沙重慶跟着成立分會，漢戲，湘戲，楚戲，川班一同加入，氣象甚爲蓬勃，雖然因於武漢陷落受了打擊，這个運動絲毫沒有停頓。最近聽說田漢先生在長沙把湘戲的演員們都組織起來了，我相信經過相當的時期，必然有相當的成績。</p>
<p>說到我个人，在舊戲界混了二十年，也曾經過十幾年的幫歌生活，對於舊戲的改革運動當然義不容辭，存心久矣，不過改革的方案一直到從歐洲囘來以後才漸次確立，方案定了，也不過是幾篇論文。戲劇是要化舞台上兌現，才見分隢的，可是這些年來因爲人事的阻障，自己生活的浮動，客觀條件終不具　，而最苦的是很難找到幾個同志，肯把我的方案搬到舞台上去試騐一番。感謝這次的抗戰，我因此而認識了金素琴女士，她是帮我作第一次試驗的先驅者。本來我編戲給人演，或是拿我編的戲去演，不算了什麼可以提出來說的事，不過有一個似乎特殊的情形，就是我在十幾年前寫的舊戲，到有不少人拿去演，新編的戲正因爲有些革新的意味，有些演員使不敢會試。并不是我內爲近來寫的綫有好些地方破壞了舊戲的習慣和組識，而是改革運動與商業市場的宗旨和作法不相符台。演員們只求敷衍着能够吃飯，，無暇攷慮戲劇本身的問題，所以得過且過，新的嘗試在多數人看來是麻煩的事。其次有些靑年演員們，的確感到純舊戲日趨於沒洛，在徬稈膽顧中逐漸也有改革的企圖，但是客觀環境和人事的壓迫使他們只能在茶餘酒後偶然談到，不能毅然參加革新運動，在這種種情勢下，金女士的熱情和她那堅决的態度，更不能不說是難得。</p>
<p>她從小就學唱戲，因爲生計的驅使，走遍了南北各省，人生况味甘苦備嘗，演劇技術的修養也因磨鍊而逐日有了進步。同時因爲受着種種刺激和壓迫，使她迫切地想從玩偶的生活中求解放就她的職業——滇劇——的本身找尋正確的新路線，來建立她自己，所以她很容易接受改革的理論。最難得的是她對於劇本的了解力相當豐富，所以她一度演過了比較有意義，有組織，詞句通順的劇本便不願冉演胡鬧的戲。這樣一來，她搭班唱戲便成問題，因爲一搭班子便無權選擇角色更無權選擇戲。所以儘管許多舞台爭相邀聘，她總是想等到局面好一點自己組織劇團。去年三月她還對我表示說從此非與改革運動有關的戲劇她不演；我以爲那是不可能的，當時我就勸她比較好的奮戲還是不妨演，而且演演亦有好戲：第一新編的戲還太少不教應用自己來自己還沒有健全的劇團，沒有專用的舞台，搭人家的班子，每天排演新戲是作不到的；三來舊劇能演得好，也讓那些迷信舊戲的人們無所藉口，他們不能說因爲不會演舊戲或是舊戲演不好，所以胡來一套改良視意見，而且個人生活也沒有法子設完全犧牲不顯。凡屬一個運動的初期，總是一步一步地推進，定一個高的標準，坐在家裏等着達目的是不行的，存心破壞而說冰凉話的人當然也不少，我們儘可不去管他，目下所要解决的有兩個問題：（一）戲本要多。（二）要物色一班比較了解的演員組鐵健全的團體。至於個人一個時期的升沉榮瘁，到不成問題，不過極力爭取觀衆却也是不宜忽視的事。</p>

<h3 id="c50">『愛國女藝人』 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>被譽爲『劇壇新女性，愛國女藝人』的金紫琴女士到港以來，宣傳品觸目皆是，各報紛戲『特寫』『專稿』，甚至還有刊印特輯的，眞可算是極一時之盛！金女士的愛國思想和藝術造詣，說者巳多，暫不置論。僅從劇團方面之極力以『愛國女劇人』和『救亡新國劇』來作宣傳資料來看，可算是當前劇運的好現象。</p>
<p>現在由由『愛國女藝人』主演的『救亡新國劇』已與本港人士相見了，關於演劇本身如何，自有專家的定評和觀眾的認識，我們希望它能不愧過去的宣傳，不負各方的期望；本港戲劇界，亦應從純友誼的立場，爲展開救亡劇運而加以批判或提供意見。</p>
<p>但是有一點不能不感覺遺憾者，就是這次金女士『救亡新國劇』所定票價似乎太高，使一般愛好戲劇的平民觀衆都有向隅之嘆，這與提倡救亡劇運的原意，顯相違背。我們連依『使戲劇成爲動員民衆的工具，爲抗戰建國與民族解放服務』的原則，希望戲院或劇團主人及金女士等愛國劇人重視此點。同時，根據過去戲劇界的實際情形，覺得此種現象，還不止於一時一地爲然，因此更希望熱心於民族和社會解放運動的戲劇界戰土，要以更大的努力，運用統一戰線的力量，促使愛國劇人與叔亡戲劇，能和半民大衆接近，防止愛國劇人的『貴族』化和救亡戲劇的宮庭化！</p>
<p>這次金女士主演『救亡新國劇』，報載第一日大堂位全數售罄，足見愛國救亡戲劇號召力之人，亦足見本港同胞愛好救亡戲劇的熱忱，戲院或劇團方面在這種號召力和觀衆的熱忱鼓勵之下，至少要認淸抗戰中每個中國人的天職，學習正在巡迥義演賑難的『中藝』，多舉行幾天爲獻金祖國和救濟難民的義演。同時希望金女士爲無愧於『愛國女藝人』的榮譽起見，極力促成此舉。我們謹爲千萬難民和砲火中的祖國，提出這個小小的要求！</p>
<h3 id="c51">舊劇改革運動前哨　中華劇團演出 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>劇目有『梁紅玉』，『桃花扇』，『漁夫恨』等，</p>
<p>民族抗戰展開以後，爲了要動員廣大的羣衆，於是，一向爲着廣大羣衆所愛好的奮劇，就開始給文化救亡工作者開始注意起來了，首先着手於舊劇改革運動的是中國戲劇界先進歐陽予倩先生等，而平劇坤伶金紫琴女土就是實踐這一運動的前驅，在大上海淪陷前，她就在歐倩予倩先生的指導下，組織了一個『中華劇團』，公演歐陽先生編導的救亡新國劇『梁紅玉』，演出之日，正值南市我軍退却的時候，情形極爲緊張。當時，郭沬若先生曾有一首詩送給她：『昔有梁紅玉，今看金素琴：千秋同敵愾，一樣感人心』，隨後，還繼在上海演出救亡新劇『桃花扇』，『漁夫恨』等，後來，因爲環境的壓迫，這運動就無法繼續了，歐陽先生南下後，念念不忘，這一運動的繼續，可惜終找不到合作的人。最近，金女士因不願久覊孤島，特地跑到香港釆，于是，他們便重新合作起來，繼續過去的改良京劇和救亡戲劇運動起來了，現在，中華劇團已於昨晚起在利舞台正式公演了，第一晚的劇目就是歐陽先生編導金女士主演的『梁紅玉』，繼續公演的救亡新京劇，將有：『桃花扇』，『漁夫恨』，『貂蟬』等，公演的日期將有十日，這對香港舊劇，將是一個很大的影嚮吧！</p>
<h3 id="c52">中藝巡回義演昨開始舉行 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>中華藝術劇團，自舉辦巡，迥義演嚮應一元還債運動後，經分函本港各慈善社團及學校嬰求合作，昨晚該團應嶺南大學附屬中學學生曾之請，赴靑山參加該校的聯誼會，以作中藝巡迥義演的開始。演出劇目，爲『放下你的鞭子』，觀衆約三百餘人，都受深刻的感動，演畢，卽席向觀衆募捐，以爲一元還債運動卽捐得一元紙幣十六張，一毫銀幣五百一十枝，仙士一百四十枚，幷有小學生以其價值四先的食品券五張捐出，合共得港幣六十八元六毛，卽由學生會代表點明宣布後，將欵由該抆直接交往中國銀行。這次巡迴義演所捐的數目雖然不多，但以中藝的精神和各社團學較合作，將來一定會有更美滿的成續的。該團第二次公演，巳定期於本月廿八，廿九，卅日三天，地址仍在中央戲院，同時他們在二次公演之後，將舉行義演籌欵賑濟　西難民，時期大約在四月中旬吧。</p>
<h3 id="c53">舞臺技術講話 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 盧敦</p>
<p>四　排演的工作</p>
<p>一切的凖備工作都做好了之後，就可以開始排演了。排演就是最實際的工作，　個演出底創造的過程。</p>
<p>决定了要開始排演導演人就召集全部的演員以及有關係的職員，如提示及音響効果一等預備動手排演。排演的時候，長劇的需四五星期，短劇的需兩星期，最爲恰當，再短則嫌匆促，但時間也不宜拉得太長，尤其在我們目前的情形之下，實在是不容許有充份的時間的，而且太久了，則演員興趣也許是要消失的。</p>
<p>在正式開排之前，先來一次圍坐朗誦劇本，這是莫斯科劇院的方法，這一個朗誦的時問就是長一點也不算得是浪費的，因爲演出技術的一切，尤其是演員的　術，大致是在這個時候研究决定的。</p>
<p>在圍坐朗誦的時候，導演者可以公開提出劇本的研究，及本人對於該劇本所取的態度，用什么樣的手法演出，對於演員的要求，而同時又可以討論決定了每一角色的性格，習慣的用語，語調，以及習慣的動作，情緒的運用，與高潮的把握。</p>
<p>在演員方面也可以任這時候把劇詞唸熟，把太拗口的詞句改正，與合作的對方討論研究，求彼此得到完滿的合作。</p>
<p>最理想的排演，應該每次都在舞臺上面舉行的，但這在目前的情形之下，事實上是不可能的；不過排演的的地方最好是與上演的舞台之尺寸相同，尤其是對於那些沒有舞台經騐的演員尤爲要緊，因爲如果平時排演的地方太小，一旦走上大舞台，就會感到茫茫無涯，排演時兩步可到圓桌，可是在舞台上非十步不到，遇到這樣的情形，舞台經驗豐富的演員還不打緊，可是對於缺乏經騐的新演員，就往往因此而把排演時預定的部位走錯了，部位走錯，與對方的合作也跟着發生錯誤，於是心慌意亂，手足無措，還能夠演得出好戲嗎？</p>
<p>在排演的時候，各種大道具在萬不得已的時候還可用其他東西替代間有著很密切的關系，比方一個演員應在説哪一句劇詞時應該拿起一根紙　，而說到最尾一句時應該點着，而當對手一開口說話時就要把火柴扔掉……，因爲這一個簡單的小動作也許就是一個很好的効果，但這効果之獲得是必須使運動的時間相配台，所以這是必須在排演的時候練習好的。要是因爲排演時沒有這些煙具而忽略過去，則上演的時候一定不容易配合著適當的時間則效果就失掉了。戲劇的演出就是律動時間的藝術，就跟昔樂一機，有拍于，有節奏的，而這進行的調于就在排演的時候决定的。</p>
<p>戲當然是分開一幕一幕的排，但在每一幕之中也可以分一段一段來排：段的分法，大致是以角色的出入場爲分配；又再從每一段之中，看其情緒之轉變而分出小節來，先一小節一小節的排，再一段一段一慕一幕的排，最後是整個的　排。</p>
<p>初排的時候，導演者對于演員的要求不宜過高，把大的部位走熟了就算了，但最要緊的就是必須要解釋給演員知道爲什麼要從這裏跑到那兒去，因爲這樣才得自然，才不致于生硬。因為從每一個稍大的動作到另一個動作之間，是必須有一小動作，加以連續不失自然的，如果演員領會到從這一動作到另一動作的意義，則當中的機妙之處，演員自身就會很自然地做出來了。</p>
<p>大部位走熟了，就開始細排，這就是聚精會神的時候了，到這時候一定要把預定的効果都做出來，導演也可以向演員要求自己理想的一切，小動作必須出來，相互間的呼吸必須注意，情緒必須把握，工作必須認眞，將來演出之成功失敗，盡在於此矣。</p>
<p>紙排的時期，就是導演者最吃力的時候。他就像樂隊演奏時的指揮者一樣，操縱著整個樂隊，也操縱着每一個樂員的演奏。這時候的導演人是不會安安樂樂地坐在一隅的，他也許要走上走下，也許又蹲在演員旁邊，但他不是在提詞，而是在操縱演員的靈魂，提示着每一場面的情結，情緒的適宜，時間的表達，，是演出上最要緊的一著！</p>
<p>經過相當時日的細排之後，導演認爲是成熱了就可以舉行試演。如果不能在舉台上試演，亦必須來一次認眞的試驗演出，大小道具及音響效果必須齊備，就恍如演出時一樣，這時使導演者可以安安樂樂地坐在觀衆席上欣賞欣賞了。不過他仍然是有工作在身的，要隨時記錄下來，如試演時戲有不合的地方，以後還須加以修正。</p>
<p>到了眞正演出的時候，導演者就可以寫寫意意地着戲了，因爲他已無實一身輕，他的工作已經完成了。</p>

<h3 id="c58">南華南控制全局　六比一淘汰東方　東方大敗確是技術不如人　南南此勝視銀牌如囊中物 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】東方會全體甲組球人的技術狀决、近來較勝於前是事實、在聯賽中偶得以逸特勞的機會、曾小挫</p>
<p>華南也是事實、因此、遂有一般人對於東方的戰鬥力、估計太高、以爲它的程度、現在準可奧南南相等面成均勢、所以、昨天那幕特別艮牌準决賽於未舉行之　、有談及勝負問題的、各執一詞、但認爲東方勝利有把握的却比較佔多數、</p>
<p>事實還是事實、東方一切不如南南的証據、在昨天一役中已揭露出　、那証據就是六比一的諾大比數、而這個相差極遠的結局、雖然尙未能斷定東方是弱者、刦毋庸否認的、此是南南的偉大、事後有人說、「昨天乍雨乍晴、塲濕　　、東方各員受到相當影響、發揮未能如意、致遭人敗、若果天晴地爽、東方前鋒定可施展突襲戰略、給予南南嚴重的威脅、倘能扳囘多過一球、難敗或不至此、』說到天雨問題、不單東方方面受影響、南南亦然、惟南南的能力、不受環境所支配、而能支配環境、此乃他們於困難處演出功夫、才是眞功夫、</p>
<p>南南大勝原因、在於能够控制局面、處自動地位、這種控制的優點、乃各員對球兒管東有方、彼此呼應、進退有據、雖則塲地濕滑、仍不失其聯絡、盤地傳送、在在得宜、　演出一個顯然以技術制勝的戰局、反觀東方各員、雖然都勇於從事、　管束球兒、多不及南南的嫻熟有路、因而聯絡散漫、連之乎前綫唯一長處的突擊、全場也未得一只、梢足牽制南南後方的、祇許竟成一人而已</p>
<p>此役南南有對慶才缺席、若前　代以郭　祺、英祺演出很好、兇如竟成、有時也被　所箝制、狡如侯澄滔、在兩重監視十、更沒法得逞、陳炳土力面間有空隙可乘、但傳切每不及時、徒勞往　、李德祺也　刺不來、故找到機會很少、間有妙射、又給張榮才妙手救去、而榮才的高强本　、亦在此役中表演無遺了、</p>
<p>在以前、還有許多人認爲東方的前衛線、似比南南好些、但昨戰已給我們一個答案、南南雖什麼才因足傷缺席、然而梁榮照的八面威風、兼顧前後、李國威與英祖之左右相應、呵成一氣、遂演出截擊供傳諸技、無一不佳、東方前衛級相與比較、實覺失色、</p>
<p>鐘打四下、南南的劉慶才沒有到塲、頗教軍帥焦急、祗因戰鼓頻催、迫得十員上陣、拚了四分鐘、急用李恩艮補充、　回郭祺做右前衛、凑成下列的陣勢、</p>
<p>（南華用　）</p>
<p>張榮才</p>
<p>李天生　麥紹漢</p>
<p>李國威　梁榮照　郭英祺</p>
<p>羅斗文　黎兆榮　馮景祥　李恩良　鄧廣森</p>
<p>（東方會）</p>
<p>劉顯漢</p>
<p>苗國華　曾仲云</p>
<p>羅偉權　宋靈聖　劉始讀</p>
<p>侯澄滔　許竟成　李德祺　吳祺祥　陳炳土</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>十八分鐘、南南　攻，東方中衛分頭搶救、兆榮得球、直搗城鬥、如脫覊之馬、矮脚虎劉始讀看見京都將陷、飛騎救駕、絆倒兆榮、裁判員與馬立判極刑、景祥主踢十二碼球、一射而中、（一比〇）、</p>
<p>廿三分鐘、短小精悍的英祺、在右路遠吊一球、景祥故作截球姿態、突然漏交兆榮、兆榮在鬥前十碼許、施其彈弓　、一　入網（二比〇）、</p>
<p>廿七分鐘、　祺不知打了那樣强心針、左奔右截、又獲實貝、巧交李恩良、恩良看見景祥在東方腹地活動、立卽撥交、景祥舉足命射、正中顯漢之身、反彈而出、量祥再射、顯漢撲救不及（三比〇）、</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>五分鐘、景祥控球有方、左閃右縮、打出去路、妙交兆榮、仲雲反身退趕、己來不及、卒被兆榮單刀建功（四比〇）、</p>
<p>十二分鐘、竟成作迂迥的盆弄、晈牙切齒、連過重關、及機施射、榮才仆地、推出界外、祗負角球、</p>
<p>廿五分鐘、東方發奮圖强、殺進南南陣地、兆榮班師救護、與炳土鬬法一囘、卒被炳土搶球傳中、祺祥截球、交與竟成、竟成左脚猛射、榮才無法施救、東方打破光蛋、（四比一）</p>
<p>卅六分鐘、善盆的景祥　依然得勢、眼看兆榮站在優越地位、立傳妙球、兆榮不辱使命、在無人攔截的地點、增記一功（五比一）、</p>
<p>四十一分鐘、廣森主踢角球、南南前鋒湧進鬥前踢出後、兆榮在人業中頂球入網（六比一）</p>
<p>四十三分鐘、東方反襲甚烈、先頭步隊、圍攻南南、彈如雨下、眼花撩亂、祺祥急射一球、中楣彈出、天生一脚勾銷、賽至完場、東方卒以一比六被淘汰、</p>
<h3 id="c59">光華輕取港會香　三比一得勝頗寫意 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>光華與香港會之聯賽、昨午四時三—分、在加路運山球場上演、厮殺結果、光華以將士用侖、聯絡有方、遂以三比一之戰續、將香港會擊敗、昨戰之初、香港曾猶能招架、且隨時伺機反攻、迄至下半時、則大露弱點、致爲光華車重圍攻、苟光華前鋒略少短傳、見機即射、則勝球當不止此數、</p>
<p>昨日光華前　與　衛、均異常落力應戰、演出亦殊伴妙、前衛線在技術上、則已見比前進步、香港會方面之進攻力景、則全靠正前鋒與兩異、兩內衛爲最軟弱、故時爲光華風進要地、統觀兩隊球員表演最佳者、光華則爲鄒文治、車石金、侯容生、李國祺四將、次爲黃擊聰、錢熾芬、香港會則爲加亞、　路遜、帕路、衣史社闌治等、</p>
<p>時屆、戰幕一啓、光華之前　、卽齊向　進香港會要地、　衝右突、勢如排山倒海、旋而石金進至腹地、學足叩門、球急如失、高路氏躍救之、亦時已不及、惜球勢略高、僅擦門楣而落荒、後鄒黃兩　、　雙跟隨衛到、不料門前中伏、被迫退囘、鏖戰移時、熾芬又　球進前、衣史社蘭治出阻、球後爲文洽截得、鄒左閃右避、看準紅心、舉足射去、應聲入網、香港奮負後、卽全力反攻、威路　先後探門、卒因足法欠神、終無建樹、</p>
<p>戰至二十五分鐘時、炳金沿邊搶淮、將球斜傳左方、景聽截而猛射、去如電掣、準且有力、不料正中高路氏之身、乃被擋出、無何、上半時終、光華一比零佔先、</p>
<p>下半時再戰、香港　之帕路、從邊反攻、華繼攔腰出阻、僅負角球、乃脫大險、此時會港會仍繼續進攻、奈何光華守衛森嚴、無法得越雷池一步、有頃、炳金又盤球沿邊直上、石金鬥前接應、一射而入網、旋文治冉再建一功、錦上添花、至是香港會不甘光蛋之辱、大舉進犯、卒由加亞奉回光華一售、以三比一完局、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>今日甲乙丙三組足球聯賽、各有一場舉行、據原定秩序、甲組有東方對聖約瑟、十葛對南華華兩揚、但士南一戰改期、故僅得東聖一役、第一週比賽時、東方以四比三勝聖隊、但今次聖隊前衛吳德榮、於本月四日出戰南華華時、拳打謝錦洪、前日初足球總會判令停賽、大吿山奴比路度等亦有倦勤說、料其陣容必非完整、由此觀之、東方應得勝朴、惟東方各員昨作銀脾賽、均不無勞疲、今日又出戰、未悉能否支持得來、故此稍爲可慮耳、今日秩序如下、</p>

<p>【本報特訊】女子籃球賽結束後、籃球房沉寂多時、到了昨天、復見熱鬧起來、爲的是女子頒獎賽在昨晚舉行、同時又是男子籃球賽的開始、</p>
<p>按照秩序、首埸是頒獎賽、由本屆女子冠軍隊梅芳對港聯隊、</p>
<p>梅芳隊裏、美蓮未見上陣、減色不少、然而、反視港聯、僅由雪花南華西南華僑四隊球員集合成軍、實力也未見强勁、</p>
<p>首節起、港聯守先光開紀錄、移時、贊珍回敬一隻、績分後來居上、此節港聯負六比四、</p>
<p>二節雙方均有進展、而且一度迫至八比八平手、昨晚守光演出雖妙、可惜投籃略欠準繩、結果、這節仍然以八比十二屈居人下、</p>
<p>下半塲更是梅芳世界、港聯雖極努力、爭奈聯絡散渙、各自爲戰、全塲不免負十八比十、冠軍隊勝、</p>

<p>至于頒獎禮、就在第一節完畢後舉行、由　惠卿頒獎、禮節很爲單簡、頒獎完畢、男子籃球跟着聞始、由東方隊對港大隊、</p>
<p>東方方面念華、徐亨、鼎芬、吉安、演出很好、港大方面、旭華雖努力、但一木不能支大廈、結果祗是徒然、</p>
<p>開始後、你來我往、卽是緊張局國、但是經過約莫十分鐘的光景後港人卽呈不支、陣地頻邀東方鐵騎踏遍、這一陣、鼎芬、念華、極爲努力、殺得港大祗有招架之功、而無還手之力、亨哥也不錯、時惹得四座掌聲不少、半場終爲卅六比十四、東方佔先、下半場東方演出更臻佳境、鼎芬、念華、恰像穿花蝴蝶一般、投籃之準、有如探囊取物、積分逐漸增加、這時港大各將已經殺得筋疲力盡、氣喘如牛、總結果七十三比廿五、東方勝、</p>

<p>（六六）在近好萊塢較小的戲院裏出風頭——、羅拔揚、葛　麗史都華都是、</p>
<p>（六七）在無綫電裏有了名氣、只要面孔也和嗓子相配、萍克勞斯貝、唐亞米契、賈克本尼、喬潘納就是這類的幸運兒、</p>
<p>（六八）學了多年的歌唱、後在洛杉磯開一個音樂會表演、一年後、你或可得到一个銀幕角色、納爾遜埃第就是這麼做的、</p>
<p>（六九）是個有錢的律師——常在業餘戲劇界申戲——錢花完了——於是由朋友幫助上了銀幕、這就是賽姆爾興茲（Salnual　S．Hfnds　）第一次演性格演員的經過、</p>
<p>（七〇）被導演領去撫養、像凱塞琳地蜜爾（Katherfne　De　Mflle）、</p>
<p>（七）是攝影師的女兒、瓊麥許（Joan　Marsh）就是例子、</p>
<p>（七二）一篇雜誌小說、將攝成電影了、而你的臉正像那小說中挿畫上的英雄的話、快去試試運氣、温毛立斯所以演Kid　Galahad就是爲此、</p>
<p>（七三）在影片公司辦事處內招攬報紙廣吿、約翰潘德遜（John　Patterson）有了上銀幕機會、</p>
<p>（七四）在好萊塢大飯店內充侍者、出人不當的隨樂而歌、陶格拉斯福萊（Douglas　Fowley）就這樣試碰運氣的、</p>
<p>（七五）做跳舞教員、假使　學生之中有一位得到試驗鏡頭的機會時、以監護人的名義、跟她一同上影片公司、格雷絲福特（GraceFord）以此法跨入影圈、</p>
<p>（七六）假如你的朋友將受試驗、要你爲他念劇詞時、好好的念、也許你可以成功、像佛琴尼費爾特（Vfrginia　Field）一樣、（她的那位朋友反落第了）、</p>
<p>（七七）和一位女明星結婚、或者她能設法替你弄到試驗鏡頭、李奧納潘恩（Leonard　Penn）就是靠了妻子格蕾黛斯喬治（GladysGeorge）之力、</p>
<p>（七八）假如你在十二歲之前已有八年的表演經驗、大胆地像襄地珈侖（JudyGarland）那樣進影片公司求一件工作做、大約不會遭拒絕的、</p>

<p>（八五）射擊準確、能在鏡頭之外擊碎演員手中的玻璃杯、你也會被人注意了、像曾米蘭、</p>
<p>（八六）由論文比賽中得獎、被送往俄國旅行、父母反對、引起各報注意、佛蘭西絲法茂（Frances　Farmer）因此得到試騐機會、</p>
<p>（八七）替一家與影片公司有關係的化粧品店表演化粧衛、他們不會忽視你的、至少他們不曾忽視了瑪拉西爾頓（Marla　Shelton）</p>
<p>（八八）爲自己寫點電影短劇、羅拔本却利（Robert　Benchl　ey）在這方面得到了成功、</p>
<p>（八八）做電影女星的攝影場女侍、六年後、加人黑人業餘表演、這是露意絲琵佛（Louise　Beaver）的過去情形、</p>
<p>（九〇）勤練接吻技衛、佛蘭克席頭茲（Frankishields）因爲得到接吻比賽的錦標、而成爲Come　AndTake　It片中的主角、</p>
<p>（九一）能有和馬克斯兄弟開頑笑的本領、瑪格麗杜蒙（Margaret　dumnot）能够、所以電影界用了她、</p>
<p>（九二）假如你來對好萊塢渡假、專心一致的致力自己的事業時、有人來對你說你正配演銀幕上匪徒的話、別理他、喬治賴甫脫不是理也不理嗎、然而他現在是大明星了、</p>
<p>（九三）能打別人打不出的噴嚏、比爾吉爾勃（Bill　Gilbert）之上銀　全　他的鼻子、——而且是个非常討厭的一个、</p>
<p>（九四）常替某名優做配角、使他覺得要到好萊塢去時非有你不可、像史密萊勃豪脫（Smlley　Burnette)之爲琪恩奧說萊（Jene　Aurtry）的配角、</p>
<p>（九五）在公共塲所毫不在意的脫衣、所以吉潑賽　絲李（Gypsy　Rose　Lee）成爲鑲幕上的露意絲霍薇克（Louise　Hovlck）了、</p>
<p>（九六）在攝影場門前賣雜誌、愛琳斐納（IrenaBenett）在健美比賽得獎後倒並不爲人注意、反在這件事上面爲電影界發現了、</p>
<p>（九七）到好萊塢來、說話是維也納口昔、衣服是巴黎的樣式、又有美國報界代你藏吹、使美國人當你眞是個伯爵夫人、莎麗瑪麗柴（Sari　Maritza）由此法成功的、</p>

<p>（一〇一）在家裏、小戲院或遊藝班裏——只要你找得着一個——學習初步演技、再上紐約舞台、更求深造、這並不是最快的捷徑、然而却是個最可靠的方法、老實說、也就是唯一的可靠方法、用此方法成功的例子可就多得舉不勝舉、且揀幾個最著名的的說吧、那就是、保羅茂尼、史賓塞屈萊賽、瑪格烈莎麗文、克勞黛考爾白、占姆斯史蒂華和貝錫爾拉斯朋等人了、（完）</p>

<p>— 文俞</p>
<p>『……一間靜悄悄的病室裏，一個垂死的病人，躺在牀上，面色漸漸的淡了，眼光漸漸涸了，一種微弱的聲息斷斷續續的臂吻間勉强的發出來，不知是呻吟，還是呼叫，『和平』『奮鬥』『救中國』一聲復一聲的，約莫至少也有四十餘聲，漸漸的連聲息也發不出來了，所能看見的，只　吻間的微動了……』</p>
<p>這是多麼感人的記敘—當時還是中山先主的信徒的汪精衛，是那樣感人的記綠着中山先生的垂死，和他的垂死的呼聲——　表着他的畢生戰鬥的意欲，也標記全中國民族的要求：『和平』，『奮鬥』，『救中國』！</p>
<p>中山先生雖然沒有親眼看到『九一八』的空前的大災難，然而他有預感，他早己指出『强鄰環列，虎視騰　……蠶食鯨吞，己見效于踵接，瓜分豆剖，實堪慮于目前』，而且還肯定了日本侵略我國的必然性。所以他縱不親自指揮整個民族走進『七月』解放戰鬥之路。然而他早已指出『一個統一的中國，儘可以抵抗日本的壓迫』，他遺下了救國的主議——三民主義，他遺下了救國的政　——聯俄容共工農三大政築，他在呼吸的最後一口氣遺下『和平』『奮鬥』『救中國』這三大口號　中山先生已亮了路燈，民族戰門的行列因以充溢着熱情，英勇與光明的渴望，而踏上了七月之路！</p>
<p>爲了和平而奮鬬，爲了世界永久的和平，爲了以戰爭永遠消滅戰爭，爲了人類，不得不奮鬬！最現實的目的是『救中國』，最光燦的任務是『爲了人類』，我們不但自己，全民族，參與戰鬬，堅决地在戰鬬，我們還向世界昭示：戰鬥吧—爲了你們的光榮與我們的—爲了你們的福利與我們的—有誰比蛆虫樣喊和平，　屈辱的和平更可恥？有誰比曲解中山先生的革命口號，革命主義，把『和平』『奮鬥』『救中國』三個神聖的火般美麗的呼號惡　化，無恥地說：和平可以救中國便要和平，奮鬥可以救中國才又奮鬥，把戰鬥的口號，借作投降的布幡，把神聖的約言借做反叛的面具，以自棄于人類？是的！中山先生呼喊和平，這是大同世界的昨示，就是公理下的和平；中山先生號召奮鬬，是「自己先聯合起來，推己及人，再把各弱小民族都聯合起來，共同去打破二萬萬五千萬人，共同用公理去打破强權」的奮鬬：無疑義，目的是『救中國』，是把中國從苟安和危亡中，帶到自由解放之路—毀滅了中山先生和平奮鬬的眞義，把和平抹上奴隸的色調，把救中國的任務曲解爲偷安半壁終于滅亡的屈辱，這就是中山先生的叛徒！進步的人類的蠶賊！</p>
<p>十四年了，我們重温中山先生臨死時的呼聲，我們感覺悲哀，也感覺興當奮！今天是中山先生逝世的紀忿日！我們爲了和平，爲了祖的自由解放，應站着每個人的岡位奮鬬　！</p>
<h3 id="c69">遙遠的友情 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 唐英偉</p>
<p>在我記憶中最使我不能忘懷的：就是在北國烽火中與敵人勇敢鬥爭着的一片遙遠的友情，他是我底心靈的慰藉，他是我一顆赤誠的心的寄託者。他是我唯一的摯友啊！</p>
<p>自從我們在江南的烈陽下揚起離別的絲巾之後，我們便各自南北。我回到南方來已有三四年的時間了，在這遙遠的離別中，我們底心靈授有一天像離人一樣堅念着。因爲我們的消息時時付託在鴿子的頸項上傳遞着的。</p>
<p>可是，平地起了一陣魔風，敵人在蘆溝橋燃起挑釁的火藥線，又伸長了魔手到上海來撥起燎原的杭戰的烈火。爲了保衛國家，保衛領土，每一個有血性的靑年都站在守衛的崗位等候與敵人搏鬬了。</p>
<p>在炮火連天的抗戰中，我的心也有如炸藥一樣的爲我底遙遠的友人焦急着——轟炸！轟炸！退却！退却！退入第二道防線，我底朋友的家終于淪陷在×人的轟炸下了。流　在江山江頭的他們母一子羣，使我更加痛恨×人的殘暴了。</p>
<p>常我底朋友難開他的母親和正懷着孕的妻子獨自走上火線與×拚命的時候，我接到他這樣一封簡短的信：</p>
<p>『我底好朋友：我現在是一個無家可歸的人了，兄弟一　多分散了。妻的妹妹被炸死了，我的一切都完了。現在我可有一條路，就是與×人拚命！　你底摯友振黃。』</p>
<p>前綫的消息一天一天地緊張起來，我對我底朋友的懷念也深深地緊張起來了。他總有一天與×人見面的，我這麼想着。但是他已有好長久的時間沒有消息給我了。我是多麼地懷念着啊！</p>
<p>我們的抗戰是不屈不撓地持久着，而我們的友情終也不被炮火衝斷而持續着。在抗戰期中最偉大的武漢大會戰，我底朋友竟也盡了一份責任參加了保衛的工作，可是武漌淪陷之後，我們的消息又是斷絕了。</p>
<p>在絕望中，我終於接到一封從前線寄來的殘舊的信，我是多麼歡喜呀：</p>
<p>『我底好朋友：這半個月來，我們一直在行軍中從宋埠而淋山河，新洲，上巴河希水，再由希示而淋山河，再由淋山河而團風，下長江，經石灰窰，下陸大冶，白沙舖而至陽新，在一處地方沒有住上三天以上的時候，所以對民衆的工作做得很少，這次從　新到瑞昌，三夜行軍，同志們都感到相當的疲勞，所以到這裏休息一天，第二天起才能開始佈置工作。瑞昌逃走的民衆不十分多，只是戰時動員工作做得很不够，所有民衆組織大都是强制地集合起來，因爲上層指導的不得力。一般民衆不知道在這危急關頭應該做些什麼的？怎樣做才好？各團體只有表面形成而無實際工作表現。所以我們來這裏後，就想趕緊發動一個保家抗敵運動，瑞昌智識靑年也有不少，但工作態度也大都是不正確的。有風頭主義的傾向，所以也亟須我們從行動中來糾正他們的錯誤。我們希望在這裏多住長久一些。郡麼，工作基礎也許可以很堅固地建立起來。這裏離九江不到五六十里路，大炮聲已可隱隱地聽到了。昨天敵機曾來光顧了兩次。摔了幾顆炸彈，幸沒有傷害多少人。本來我們是可以和總司令部的各機關一樣地住到郊外去，但是爲了工作的便利起見，我們還是住在城裏。我們住在一個很大的花團裏，什麼都感到舒服，這是我們在抗戰以來第一次享受到的舒適哩！</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>在瑞昌時我沒有把給你的寫信完又突然奉命令出發了。現在我們駐在一個離九江不到三數十里路的小村上。每天在敵機的轟炸下，和大炮聲中進行工作，昨今兩天九江已陷入混戰狀態中，當然很吃緊，所以我們對於工作也不敢再有一刻或一絲的鬆忽。這武漢東西長江上一個重要的門戶，我們是要堅守不放的。敵人也下了决心侵佔。敵機天天轟炸，附近村鎭全無墓地被毀。成千成萬的農民被犧牲了。我們眼看着這一片血肉迷糊的景象。誰都加深了敵愾同仇的有心啊……！</p>
<p>在軍旅中寄信付郵眞很難有機會，今天因爲同决事要到後方去，所以才趕緊潦草地寫這封信，請你不要見笑。因爲時間關係餘話下次再談吧！』</p>
<p>讀了這封信，我深深地受感動了。我不能們像我底朋友一樣，在火線上工作着，內心委實感到慚愧的難過，但是，有了一位好朋友在戰塲，也是值得安慰的啊！私心的設想却使我感到後方生活的孤寂與不緊張，而受譴實了。</p>
<p>我有時想召我底好的朋友回後方來休息片刻，但自己却時常想走向前方去伴我底戰友。可是命運不給予我們這遙遠的友情匯合在一起。我只好永遠被遺棄在後方接受前線的戰友報道的佳昔了。</p>
<p>又是好久沒有得到前線的消息了。</p>
<p>——好朋友：我們已到廣東的曲江來住下半個多月了，我們在這裏發動了一個廣大的民衆運動，——但是，好久沒有得到你的信，在工作中，我是多麼着懸念地你啊！</p>
<p>遙遠的友情呀！永遠地多麼使人懷念着啊！</p>
<h3 id="c70">宋朝的二個傀儡皇帝 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 杰</p>
<p>——讀史隨筆</p>
<p>金人侵略宋朝，會經二次設立傀儡政府，富行以華制華的　計，第一次在靖康二年，金兵進攻汴京，把徽欽帝二據去，另立宋臣張邦昌爲楚帝。但後來金兵北囘，張邦昌也就退位，只做了三十六天的短命皇帝，第二次設立愧儡政府是在建炎三年，金人立劉豫爲齊帝。劉豫過了八年皇帝癮，也被金人廢掉。</p>
<p>張邦昌興劉豫雖同是萬世唾罵的漢奸一，但二人也有程度之差，張邦昌做傀儡，是被金人硬拉出來的，而非出於目頭，所以他登台做傀儡後，還有些顧忌，不敢妄作妄爲，他召見百官自稱『予』，不敢稱『朕』。委任官職同，部加一個『權』宇，表示這是暫時性質的。他派人去奉迎宋康王，自己陳訴說：『所以勉循金人推立者，欲權宜一時，以紆國難耳，非敢有他也。』可見張邦昌還不算是漢奸，只能說是一個糊涂的傀儡龍了！</p>
<p>但劉協却是一個十足道地的賣國漢奸　劉豫做傀儡，並不楚會人捧出來的。而是自己去　需求得的。他把重金寶賂去運動敵人撻懶。做了八年的偽皇帝，非但沒有半些羞恥顧忌之心，反甘心作敵人的應犬，幾次引兵入寇祖國，眞可算喪心病狂之至了！</p>
<p>張邦昌劉豫這兩個叛國的傢伙，後來都沒有好結果。張邦昌雖然後來反正到宋朝來，但叛國逆臣，國法所不容，終于被宋高宋賜死。劉豫有金國要大撻懶，粘罕二人的靠山，縱能上台；但後來撻懶粘突二人失勢。靠山一倒，漢奸失了憑藉，終於被他的主子（金人）廢掉。金人把他囚在金明池，偽皇帝變作皆下囚，結果奄奄而死在敵國裏。這二個愧儡皇帝的下場。同樣悲慘，大可以作爲目前漢奸們的殷鑑！</p>
<h3 id="c71">星相家的妙用 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>日本軍閥，素來用一種麻醉手段，鼓勵人民侵略的野心，所以『護身符』『千人針』一類的東西，便是他們神道設教，愚弄其民的無上法寶，道種手段的卑劣愚蠢。實等於西太后利用『義和團』，以爲槍砲可以不入，刀火可以不傷，同一可笑。</p>
<p>最近更異想天開，發明一個欺騙民衆的新法子，昨據路透電『東京業星相者三十人，經警廳長訓話後，已組織公會，並决令在此對華作戰之緊急時期中，對於來問前途禍福者，鼓勵其樂觀』，這種卑陋庸惡的辦法，非但可笑，實是可憐。以這樣大的東京，僅僅三十名相土，分配恐嫌不够，幷且迷信之徒，前來請問禍福者，該星相家司以隨便說謊，任意胡講，假定東京人民，並不來問前途禍福，則該星相家英雄無用武之地，無可說謊，則如之何？在這裏，我還可以獻一個補充的辦法。</p>
<p>只要警廳長下一命令：（一）凡居住東京的人民，　須至星相家處問卜休咎，如不到星相家問休咎者，當作蘊藏反動思想倫。（二）凡住居東京之人民，不問男女老小，均須身佩『批命書』一紙，如我國游擊區域之人民，必須有『通行證』『牛痘證』『防疫證』一樣，倘檢查人民身畔，或人家無『批命書』者，得以大逆不道論。如此日本人民的獻戰思想，便無從發，幷且可以根本劇除，這豈不是一個絕妙的方法。</p>
<p>但是星相家的原則，是『問災不問福』的，假定東京的星相家，根據星相家的原則，如『張鐵口』『李鐵嘴』，同樣老實，一本直奏，不稍隱瞞，我恐東京的人民，要全部動搖起來，日本全國的火藥庫，多要像大阪一機的危險，卽使星相家，能奉命承教，如法泡製，但自開戰以來，二十個月，物價一天一天高漲，經濟一天一天緊縮，人口一天一天減少，孀婦一天一天增多，陣亡將土『榮譽』的公墓，到處皆是，壯士的死灰，從兵艦中連續不斷的運送回來，在這種情形之下，我想這般星相家，雖口若懸河，說得怎樣天花亂墜，在東京的人民，到底有些不能相信罷？故此種辦法，徒見其心勞日拙而已，我於此者出日本軍閥的無聊，與手脚的忙亂。</p>

<p>他不在意地接過洒杯來，一口飲盡了：不用手隨便地取了一片肉腸，很熟練地！拋，便拋到口里，他嚼着，走了。</p>
<p>酒店的主人，以奇異而壓惡的眼色，送開了這位放蕩而無體的客人的背影。</p>
<p>他走出酒店以後，讓酒的温暖抵抗着身外的寒冷：因爲他美好外衣的裏面，國有一身廉價的襯衣和襯褲——已經汚　，而且破碎：如果被人發覺了他這不相調協的服裝，便可成爲他罪名的證據。所以他故意以緩慢的步子，控制着急燥的心情；並且，把手杖不住地搖擺着，劃破飛沿路完整的雪面——表示行獵以後的得意而悠閑的神情。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Some Opinions on Secondary Education Reform After the War <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenchang</p>
<p>Secondary education, being in the middle of the educational system, targets the most lively and vibrant youth. Its function must take into account both general education and vocational education. Its mission must enable students to enter institutions of higher education, while also equipping them with the qualities, attitudes, concepts, and abilities of normal and healthy citizens. As such, running a secondary school is difficult, not only in other countries but even more so in China. Because education is the upper layer of social institutions, its foundation is based on politics, economics, and all aspects of society.</p>
<p>Since our country adopted the Western educational system (in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, i.e., 1902 AD), nearly forty years have passed. The educational system has been changed repeatedly, but little effect has been seen. Pessimists even believe that the country's poverty and the people's destitution are due to education, only knowing how to consume and not engage in production, only seeking superficiality and not valuing practicality. Although there is some truth in this criticism, it is not entirely accurate. There is no country in the world where politics and economics are not on track, yet education can be run well independently. Therefore, education is closely related to society. To discuss how to reform education, we must first look at the trends of society. Secondary education is a link in the entire educational system and naturally cannot be separated from this.</p>
<p>What will be the situation in our country after the war? We might as well make some predictions. First, our sacred war of resistance will inevitably achieve final victory. Second, our politics will inevitably move towards a republican government based on the Three Principles of the People. Third, our economy will inevitably feel extremely difficult after the war, requiring international investment, government-controlled construction, and development, and therefore urgently needing talents for construction in various fields. Fourth, our education and culture will inevitably become more developed because of this war of resistance, and a system of education suited to our own needs will be established. Public education and basic education (including primary and secondary education) will inevitably become more widespread, and higher education will inevitably become more practical and in-depth. This is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Because secondary education after the war will inevitably have the following trends: (1) the number of students will inevitably increase, (2) the economic situation of general parents will inevitably become more difficult, (3) vocational education will inevitably be more needed, (4) general education will inevitably seek to increase training and efficiency, and (5) secondary schools will inevitably become more widespread in rural towns and small cities. Therefore, the following points should be noted for the reform of secondary education after the war:</p>
<p>First, because the number of students is greater, the original school buildings are not enough to accommodate them, and many of the existing school buildings have been destroyed. Of course, after the war, the construction of school buildings must be planned in general. In terms of quality, only solidity is required, not luxury. In terms of quantity, the balance of classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and playgrounds should be taken into account, so that the capacity of classrooms can accommodate the number of the entire school. However, the capacity of the library, laboratory, self-study room, and playground can also accommodate the number of the entire school. If so, the Gary system or the Dalton Plan can be tried, so that one school can accommodate the students of two schools, so that the number of students in the classroom is equal to the number of students in the library, laboratory, self-study room, and playground, and so that classroom learning, experiments, self-study, and sports are rotated. If every room and every field has no empty seats, then it can accommodate twice as many students. This is much better than the half-day schools in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places that make students bored at home for half a day. Moreover, in this way, it is not only symbol recognition and knowledge infusion, but also skills training, physical exercise, and not only classroom learning but also guided self-study, which can be called complete education. Second, because the economic situation of general parents will inevitably become more difficult, in addition to reducing fees and increasing public, free, and work-study quotas, the semester system can be promoted, dividing one year into four seasons, with six weeks in the summer season for remedial classes, and the remaining three seasons of autumn, winter, and spring, each season lasting fourteen weeks. According to my experience in running a short-term experimental class at the East China United Middle School from May to July last year, fourteen weeks can complete the courses of a normal semester. The current six-year circular curriculum for senior and junior high schools has a lot of waste and repetition. For example, there are many repetitions in history, geography, science, mathematics, Chinese, and other teaching materials. If they can be re-edited, from shallow to deep, simplified, and supplemented with modern materials, and the materials for a twenty-week semester are allocated to fourteen weeks, focusing on practice, application, and experiments, then what is gained will not have the disadvantage of rote learning. A few years ago, some important officials of the National Government proposed abolishing holidays and shortening the length of the school year. Last year, the Ministry of Education ordered a few middle schools to experiment with completing six years of middle school in five years, shortening the length of the school year, which is what everyone wants. Especially in post-war China, where funding is difficult and talents are urgently needed, using the semester system instead of the term system can complete six years of middle school in four years. If there are a few students with poor grades, they will only repeat one semester, and the time will also be very economical. If there are one or two subjects that fail, they can also take remedial classes in the summer and then take supplementary exams.</p>
<p>Third, because vocational education is more needed due to the urgency of construction, in addition to vocational departments in higher education, secondary schools also need to train a large number of grassroots personnel in the vocational sector. However, it is very difficult to make the equipment and teachers of vocational schools satisfactory. This can be remedied by the work-study system, using the equipment and technicians of factories, farms, and hospitals to solve the difficulties of equipment and teachers. Factories that get these apprentice-style students will be more satisfied and familiar when recruiting them as employees in the future. There can still be general basic subjects and vocational theory subjects in the school to connect theory and practice. Senior students can have some wages or benefits to make up for living expenses, thereby reducing the burden on parents. The length of this type of school can be slightly longer, but experience can be greatly increased, and there will be no other way to go after graduation except for further education.</p>
<p>Fourth, in today's secondary schools, the basic tool subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics are not very effective. The reason is that the goals are complex, the materials are too deep, and there is too little practice, so there is a downward trend. The reason, in addition to the issue of the selection of teaching materials, is the lack of self-study time and the inappropriateness of guidance, or even no guidance at all, such as the current half-day system. The way to remedy this is to implement strict and precise self-study guidance. There are two methods: one is to concentrate half a day on guidance (the other half day for class), schedule self-study time for major subjects, and have specialized teachers guide students in grades and groups, answer questions, practice assignments, practice answering questions, and so on. High-achieving students can also be assigned to each group as group leaders to answer easier questions. This can reduce the number of failing students and make them proficient and in-depth. One is to have self-study in class by subject, with the original teachers guiding the original assigned homework. The class time can be slightly longer, divided into two sections, with the upper section for class and the lower section for self-study, such as forty minutes or thirty minutes each. For subjects that are too numerous and cannot be allocated, major subjects can be selected, or even implemented one or two days a week. In a fifty-minute class, thirty to thirty-five minutes can be used for class, and the remaining twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour can be used for selective self-study guidance, so that the main difficulties have been solved under the guidance of the original teachers, and the students' self-study will not be as difficult as before.</p>
<p>Fifth, secondary schools should not only be concentrated in cities, but should also be popularized in rural towns, villages, and counties, so that secondary school students do not have to travel far from home, and at the same time, the school can be familiar with the situation of rural society and can adapt to it. Secondary schools going to the countryside is an inevitable path after the war, so that the seeds of our country can be planted in every village. But there is one difficulty, that is, there are few students, because our country's villages are small villages, and primary education has not yet been popularized, so it is advisable to choose a village or county town with a denser population and a suitable location to set it up when it is first established. If there are not many students, the composite system of the same grade or the composite system of multiple grades can be used, but the number of groups should not be more than two, so that two different levels can be carried out simultaneously without wasting time, answering questions, and self-study under the guidance of experienced teachers. Moreover, if this system is implemented, spring students and autumn students can still be recruited for composite teaching, and there will be no difficulties due to the small number of people.</p>
<p>Finally, we must know that how to implement the above-mentioned reforms depends on getting the right teachers. In the future, education in our country will not be about changing the system and educational system, but about the training and retention of teachers. The Ministry of Education has recently established normal colleges, giving them five years of training, focusing on specialized and professional training in addition to general subjects and basic education subjects, which is a good policy. Personality training is carried out with the tutor system, then the improvement of secondary education can be expected. However, the success of this kind of talent training will be in a few years, and may not be immediately popularized, so the in-service training of teachers in the next five or ten years is also very important. Generally, in-service teachers are not very enthusiastic about further studies. One reason is that they seek progress and recognition, but a big reason is that they are trapped by family affairs and funding. Therefore, it is natural to add one, half, or one-third of the teacher's salary to the school budget so that one teacher can be rotated to the further education class of the normal college for one year every year, two years, or every three years. During the leave period, they still receive their original salary, so the teachers have no worries, and the progress of their studies will be more effective. What do those who have quality educational administration think?</p>

<h3 id="e2">Commemorating the Father of the National Revolution - Mr. Sun Yat-sen <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Mi</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese nation's liberation struggle and the mentor of the Eastern national revolutionary movement, has been gone from us for a full fourteen years! In these fourteen years, international affairs have indeed undergone significant developments, and the situation in China has experienced even more astonishing changes. Today, as we remember Mr. Sun's life-long dedication to the liberation of the Chinese nation, we cannot help but be filled with elation and excitement. However, the state of the Republic of China, arduously established and passed down to us by Mr. Sun, now withering and shattered under the internal and external attacks of imperialism and feudal remnants, how can we not beat our chests, stamp our feet, feel guilty, and blame ourselves! But now, the full-scale war of resistance against Japan and national salvation has been launched and persisted for over twenty months. Mr. Sun's life-long aspiration to unite all parties, factions, armies, and circles across the country to establish a united front has been realized. Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People, formed from forty years of revolutionary experience, have been established as the supreme principle of the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese nation. The Three Great Policies and the ideal of democratic politics, which Mr. Sun never forgot during his lifetime and hoped to realize, have also been unanimously recognized by the nation as the most correct policies to advance the current stage of the Chinese revolution, the war of resistance, and national reconstruction. Today, as the war of resistance turns to its second phase, all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation are inheriting Mr. Sun's revolutionary spirit, striving to complete Mr. Sun's unfinished aspirations, and fighting to create a new China with national independence, democratic rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness. As we commemorate the fourteenth anniversary of Mr. Sun's death at this time, we feel not only infinite sorrow but also infinite encouragement!</p>
<p>(I) The Great Significance of Commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen</p>
<p>Our commemoration of the fourteenth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death today is by no means comparable to ordinary "mourning the dead and grieving the living" or "remembering former sages."</p>
<p>First, we must understand that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the savior of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Before the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese nation was in a dire situation of double oppression, on the one hand, the oppression of the dark forces of the Manchu Qing feudalism, and on the other hand, the encirclement and pressure of the great powers and imperialism, which attempted to turn China into a complete colony. This crisis was similar to the situation in Tsarist Russia before the October Revolution in the Soviet Union. Mr. Sun alone was able to synthesize the revolutionary ideas of the Enlightenment period and the experience and lessons of the national revolutionary struggle since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, match them with the international environment and the special conditions at home, rely on his prescience and strong, unyielding determination to struggle, and a fighting spirit that grew stronger in the face of danger, to call upon the whole country, travel around China and abroad, personally experience hardship, rally comrades, unite friendly parties, overthrow the Manchu Qing, and establish the Republic, rescuing the Chinese nation from the internal and external double crisis. Therefore, it is most appropriate to call Mr. Sun Yat-sen the savior of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Second, we must also recognize that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the highest principles of the national revolution.</p>
<p>Overthrowing the Manchu Qing and freeing the Chinese nation from feudal oppression was only the beginning of the revolution. To achieve the ideal of the revolution, to enable the Chinese nation to survive in the world forever and seek normal development, to thoroughly achieve the equality of the entire Chinese nation in the international arena, as well as political equality and economic equality, and to thoroughly realize national independence, democratic rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness, he created the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, in order to realize the Three Principles of the People, he also formulated the National Reconstruction Program and the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, so that comrades could unite friendly parties and friendly armies according to certain guidelines and steps, and lead the national masses to work together. The history of the Republic of China for the past twenty-eight years has proven the correctness of creating a new China with the Three Principles of the People. Implementing the Three Principles of the People can save China, while abandoning the Three Principles of the People will only lead to destruction. Lenin, the "Father of World Revolution," also recognized that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People expressed the most urgent and fundamental demands of the broadest masses of the Chinese people, calling them "ideas produced by a profound revolutionary movement of hundreds of millions of people." Every Chinese son and daughter who is loyal to the cause of national liberation should inherit this great idea, develop it in a new environment and under new conditions, and realize it.</p>
<p>Third, we must understand the contemporary significance of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies.</p>
<p>When discussing Eastern nations and the Chinese national revolutionary movement, Lenin solemnly said: "We see the truly great ideas of this great nation; this nation is not only good at weeping because of its long years of enslavement, not only good at idealizing freedom and equality, but also good at fighting against those who have long oppressed China!"</p>
<p>Mr. Sun was not only an outstanding modern Chinese revolutionary and thinker but also a great revolutionary strategist. He laid down the guidelines and paths for how to realize his great ideas and revolutionary goals: the Three Great Policies of the revolution (alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers). In his will at the time of his death, Mr. Sun said: "Based on forty years of experience, I deeply know that to achieve this goal, it is necessary to awaken the masses and unite with those nations in the world that treat us equally, and struggle together." In his letter to Lenin, the leader of the Soviet revolution, he further emphasized his fervent hope: "Dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will greet a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally." Mr. Sun also reorganized the Kuomintang in 1924, not only establishing a close united front with the Communist Party but also allowing the Communist Party to join the Kuomintang. After the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1924, the revolutionary movement developed rapidly, and the prestige and strength of the Kuomintang also increased rapidly. The Northern Expedition went straight down, invincible; later, the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party changed the situation. This was something that Mr. Sun could not have foreseen, but it is something that we have all experienced! These experiences clearly tell us that Mr. Sun's Three Great Policies and the advocacy of a united front are the only correct methods and paths to realize the Three Principles of the People. Without the Three Great Policies and a united front, there would be no implementation of the revolutionary Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of our national liberation movement, although he laid down the strategy and path to victory, did not live to see the success of the Chinese national revolution and left us forever! Every one of us who is loyal to the cause of national liberation should take it as our duty to continue to struggle and implement the strategies set by Mr. Sun!</p>
<p>(II) New Environment and New Tasks</p>
<p>The new environment and new conditions are very different from the time when Mr. Sun led us to fight for national liberation. However, the revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the correct Three Great Policies that Mr. Sun left us, as well as Mr. Sun's own revolutionary spirit and methods of struggle, are forever shining in our eyes. How should we use them to match the new environment and new conditions to develop and realize them?</p>
<p>First, the War of Resistance has been going on for more than twenty months.</p>
<p>In order to oppose the Japanese fascist aggression, strive for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the Chinese nation, and realize Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People, we have heroically persisted in the War of Resistance for more than twenty months. During these twenty months, we have lost the most important cities in the country, we have sacrificed more than a million excellent sons and daughters, and we have encountered many unimaginable difficulties. However, we have annihilated seven or eight hundred thousand elite Japanese troops, we have consumed military expenses equal to the total wealth of Japan, we have increased the insurmountable difficulties of the Japanese aggressors' future, and at the same time, we have realized the national unity that has not been achieved in more than twenty years, we have washed away the national humiliation of surrendering to foreign powers for nearly a hundred years, we have increased our prestige and sympathetic assistance in the international arena, and we have discovered the promising future of persisting in united, protracted resistance and victory.</p>
<p>As we recall the enormous wounds and sacrifices, we should correct our shortcomings and weaknesses and strengthen our determination to resist to the end and rebuild our country. As we look at the great successes, we should raise our national self-esteem and confidence in victory and intensify our political progress to win the final victory. Today, in the negative aspect, we must recall Mr. Sun's past spirit of resolutely opposing feudal forces, opposing the exploiting class, opposing double-dealers, and opposing defeatism, in order to sweep away these obstacles to the future of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. In the positive aspect, we must recall Mr. Sun's lifelong advocacy of raising the national self-esteem and self-confidence of the entire nation and mobilizing the dynamic strength of the entire nation to advance the War of Resistance and national reconstruction to success and victory.</p>
<p>Second, the united front is strengthening and developing.</p>
<p>Since the full-scale outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, we are most fortunate that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the largest political parties leading the Chinese national revolution, have moved from division to unity, thereby starting to realize an unprecedentedly solid unity throughout the country. For more than twenty months since the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and all anti-Japanese parties have been able to achieve closer cooperation despite the very serious obstruction and attacks from traitors and collaborators, making the anti-Japanese national united front continue to consolidate and develop, and providing the greatest guarantee for the final victory of the revolutionary cause of the entire nation's War of Resistance and national reconstruction. This guarantee is now being recognized by the world with the sympathetic aid to China movement. It is our glory that we can faithfully implement the solemn instructions and the path that Mr. Sun gave us and once led. However, the painful experience of the past fifteen years should also teach every Chinese son and daughter engaged in the cause of national revolution that we must understand that Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the united front are not only cooperation in the War of Resistance but may and must be long-term cooperation in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, because only in this way can we guarantee the final success of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. At the same time, the current stage of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the united front is not yet sufficiently consolidated and developed, and therefore cannot give a fatal blow to the enemy, making them lose their offensive power, so that we can launch a counter-offensive and recover lost territories. Therefore, today we should further consolidate and develop Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the united front to commemorate our leader Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In particular, to Generalissimo Chiang, who is leading the entire nation in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and leading us to consolidate and expand Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the united front, we should pay great respect and enthusiastic support!</p>
<p>Third, the removal of pro-Japanese compromisers:</p>
<p>In leading the national revolutionary struggle, Mr. Sun used the most stern and resolute attitude to deal with all wavering, compromising, and rebellious elements within the party, and used the most sincere and frank attitude to welcome talents from outside the party to participate in and enrich the strength of the party, so that the Kuomintang grew rapidly from arduous struggles. The reorganization in 1924 can be regarded as a model for a healthy revolutionary camp in the world's national revolutionary struggles. Now, when Generalissimo Chiang leads the Three Principles of the People's War of Resistance against Japan and discovers a small number of corrupt, stubborn, selfish, and pro-Japanese compromisers within the party, he immediately removes them with the most serious and resolute attitude; for example, the expulsion of the traitor Wang Jingwei from the party has aroused enthusiastic support from national public opinion. At the same time, Generalissimo Chiang's impartial attitude towards talents from outside the party, solemnly introducing, helping, and closely cooperating with them, is even more praised by Chinese and foreign public opinion. To commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen today, we must understand Mr. Sun Yat-sen's attitude and support Generalissimo Chiang's attitude, especially at this time when some pro-Japanese traitors and compromisers continue to lurk and undermine unity and resistance. We must more seriously and earnestly learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Generalissimo Chiang.</p>
<p>Fourth, the characteristics of the new stage of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The characteristic of the current stage of the War of Resistance is that the situation is dramatically changing from the enemy being superior and we being inferior to the enemy and us being evenly matched, it is entering the second phase from the first phase, from the first stage of retreat to the second stage of stalemate, and the third stage of preparing for a counter-offensive. In this stage, the enemy's domestic and international difficulties are increasing day by day to the point of being irreparable, while at the same time we are becoming stronger as we fight, and the domestic and international situation is also becoming more and more favorable, gradually reaching the stage of stopping the enemy's offensive and developing our army's counter-offensive. But at the same time, we must know that the enemy's offensive strength has not completely disappeared, and a new and most cruel offensive is being actively promoted, and the "anti-communist" truce plot to undermine our national united, protracted resistance is also continuing. The crisis of the Chinese nation's demise has not passed. We commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen to overcome new difficulties with Mr. Sun's forty years of unyielding and unremitting spirit and finally defeat Japan.</p>
<p>Fifth, the trend of the international situation</p>
<p>Recently, the international situation has more clearly divided into two major camps: one is the fascist aggression camp. Under the "anti-communist" pact, Japan, Germany, and Italy are actively promoting a major war to attack England, America, and France and re-divide the world. The other is the democratic peace camp, and the rulers of the capitalist countries that advocate democratic peace are still continuing to compromise and concede. However, the U.S. government, under the more insane threat of fascism, has responded to the Soviet Union's call for democratic and peaceful countries to jointly sanction dictatorial and aggressive countries, and the broad masses of people around the world are more actively building, consolidating, and developing an anti-fascist and anti-aggression front. We are now doing the vanguard of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle. Today, we should further follow Mr. Sun's will to "unite with those nations in the world that treat us equally and struggle together," especially to unite with the Soviet Union, the pillar of world peace, and to unite with democratic countries such as England, America, and France to consolidate the peaceful front, resist and oppose the fascist and anti-aggression forces, and strive for national liberation and world peace.</p>
<p>(III) How to Commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen</p>
<p>We have already proposed how we should develop and realize Mr. Sun's ideas and revolutionary ideals based on the new environment and new conditions, pointing out the path to win the success of the current War of Resistance and national reconstruction and to realize Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People. We also need to raise the question of how to commemorate the fourteenth anniversary of Mr. Sun's death. The following three points should be our minimum requirements for each of us. First, we must learn Mr. Sun's revolutionary spirit.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun fought heroically for forty years to lead the entire nation to realize China's independence and freedom. He gave all his spiritual strength to the great cause of national liberation and national revolution. Until his dying breath, he still exhorted his party members and the people of the whole country to continue to complete his legacy. Moreover, Mr. Sun began his revolutionary career by opposing the corrupt and dark Manchu Qing autocratic government, and went through opposing the rapacious and brutal warlord rule and the aggression of international imperialism. In Mr. Sun's lifelong heroic struggle, his persistence, his unyielding spirit in the face of danger, his unwavering determination in the face of difficulties, his self-sacrifice for the country, his integrity and selflessness, his extreme and earnest sympathy for the laboring masses, and his extreme and deep hatred for oppressors and exploiters, all fully embody the noble spirit and heroic spirit of our Chinese nation, and all serve as models for today's soldiers, men, and women youths who are working for the cause of national liberation.</p>
<p>Second, we must strive to thoroughly realize the revolutionary Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>What are the Three Principles of the People? Mr. Sun's "Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang" clearly told us:</p>
<p>"(1) Nationalism: The Kuomintang's nationalism has two meanings: first, the Chinese nation seeks liberation, and second, all ethnic groups within China are equal. In the first aspect, the purpose of the Kuomintang's nationalism is to make the Chinese nation independent and free in the world. ... In the second aspect, ... the Kuomintang dares to solemnly declare: to recognize the self-determination of all ethnic groups within China. After the victory of the revolution against imperialism and warlords, a free and unified Republic of China (a united Republic of ethnic groups) will be formed.</p>
<p>(2) Democracy: The Kuomintang's democracy ... all individuals and groups that truly oppose imperialism shall enjoy all freedoms and rights, and all traitors who serve imperialism and warlords, whether they are groups or individuals, shall not enjoy such freedoms and rights.</p>
<p>(3) People's Livelihood: The Kuomintang's principle of people's livelihood has no more important principles than two: one is equal land ownership, and the other is restriction of capital. ... The state should give land to farmers who lack land and become tenants, and provide them with land to cultivate, and organize water conservancy and transplant wasteland to equalize land fertility. The state should set up regulatory agencies such as farmers' banks to supply their needs for farmers who lack capital and borrow at high interest rates and are burdened with debt for life, so that farmers can enjoy the joy of life they deserve. ... The state should seek relief for unemployed workers, and especially formulate labor laws to improve the lives of workers. In addition, systems such as old-age care, childcare, care for the disabled, and universal education, which have mutually supportive characteristics, should all be strived to realize. All of this is the affair of the people's livelihood."</p>
<p>We recall that the main reason why the Northern Expedition developed so rapidly and was invincible was that the army was filled with revolutionary spirit, and the peasants and workers unanimously assisted, and the fundamental reason was the propaganda and agitation of the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, especially the slogan of striving for the political and economic equality of peasants and workers and their revolutionary leadership. In this stage where we are fighting for the final victory of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction on the ground, we should appeal to "thoroughly realize the revolutionary Three Principles of the People" in order to seek equality in international status, equality in political status, and equality in economic status, in order to realize national independence, democratic rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness.</p>
<p>Third, the necessary conditions for winning the second stage of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>In leading the struggle to save the Chinese nation, Mr. Sun, based on his life's struggle experience, indicated to us the direction and path of struggle, which are the great Three Great Policies and the advocacy of a united front. Today's new environment and new conditions more urgently require us to thoroughly realize Mr. Sun's Three Great Policies and the principles of the united front. To put it concretely, today we must concentrate all our strength, and politically we must: (1) support Generalissimo Chiang, support the National Government, support Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, oppose division and splitting, and oppose any traitorous puppet regime; (2) implement democratic politics under centralized leadership, closely link the government with the people, and maximize the ability of the anti-Japanese regime; (3) expand the unified mass movement and fully support the war; (4) unite all Chinese ethnic groups, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yao, and Yi, and grant equal rights to "jointly resist Japan" and establish a unified country; (5) promote the movement to eliminate traitors and consolidate the front line and the rear; (6) develop the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and anti-Japanese parties, strengthen the united front, and persist in the protracted war of resistance. Secondly, in military terms, (1) improve the combat effectiveness of the main force, defend Central China, South China, and Northwest China, and stop the enemy's offensive; (2) expand and develop guerrilla warfare behind the enemy, create and consolidate our base areas, reduce the enemy's occupied areas, and cooperate with the main force in combat; (3) improve military technology and create mechanized corps, and prepare for counter-offensive strength. Next, in economic terms, (1) implement new wartime financial and economic policies to adapt to the new needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction; (2) improve the lives of the people and stimulate the people's enthusiasm for the War of Resistance and production. Next, in cultural terms, (1) highly promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, persist in the War of Resistance to the end, overcome pessimistic and disappointed emotions, and oppose compromising attempts; (2) implement the anti-Japanese education policy, so that education serves the protracted War of Resistance, create and expand various cadre schools, train a large number of anti-Japanese cadres, and extensively develop mass education to improve the national culture and national consciousness of the people. In addition, in foreign relations, we must implement: (1) strive for international assistance, unite with the Soviet Union that treats us equally, unite with democratic and peaceful countries such as England, America, and France, and concentrate our forces to defeat Japanese imperialism; (2) establish a unified anti-aggression front between Chinese and Japanese soldiers and civilians and [illegible] to jointly oppose [illegible].</p>
<p>At this new stage when the Chinese national liberation war is in full swing, and at this new stage when the international situation is dramatically turning in our favor, as we commemorate the leader of the national liberation struggle and the mentor of the Eastern revolution, we should learn his arduous and outstanding revolutionary history, hold high his banner of the Three Principles of the People, which represent the great ideas of our great nation, we should loyally follow his Three Great Policies, consolidate and develop the anti-Japanese national united front, and work together to drive out the common enemy of the entire nation and the whole world and welcome an independent, free, and happy China and a truly peaceful world!</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Greatness of the Premier <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of the death of our Founding Father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen. All citizens of the Republic of China, when drinking water, think of its source, and should not forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who painstakingly created this Republic of China. All citizens of the Republic of China should fervently commemorate the painstaking efforts and significance of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in establishing the Republic of China, and resolutely implement the Three Principles of the People and the Three Great Policies advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>Just now, when I read the Premier's testament to the phrase "treat me as an equal nation," I felt infinitely touched. This time, Britain has been extremely helpful to us, and recently even assisted us with huge sums of money, which is enough to know that righteous countries are never afraid of not being sympathized with. I still remember Mr. Sun's efforts in the revolution in those years, and I also clearly remember the words he exhorted us with when he was dying. Mr. Sun was not a man with an army, nor was he an official of the Manchu Qing government at the time, nor was he a man with a wealthy property, but only a younger brother from a middle-class family—a young student of medicine. I know that because he studied medicine, he had a heart of compassion for all people. Expanding the compassionate heart of treating individuals, he then had the ambition to treat people and the country, thereby treating the Chinese people who were suffering from the oppression and devastation of the Manchu Qing imperial system. At that time, although the politics of the Manchu Qing imperial system were corrupt, they oppressed the people internally and lost power and humiliated the country externally. However, that ruling force still stubbornly resisted, acting arbitrarily and doing whatever they wanted. They exhausted the people's wealth, leading to a life of misery for the people. Mr. Sun, with his unparalleled spirit, went through ten failures, still unyielding, and finally overthrew the imperial rule that had hindered progress for thousands of years, and created this independent and free Republic of China. However, because the remnants of the reactionary forces at that time had not been completely eliminated, this resulted in a situation of warlord separatism for many years, with compatriots destroying each other and the people suffering, no less than during the rule of the Manchu Qing imperial system. Mr. Sun, with his profound insight into the national situation, specifically proposed the Three Principles of the People and the Three Great Policies in 1924—alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. Later, because the soldiers of that year could not fully carry out the teachings, Mr. Sun then came to the north to expand publicity and abolish unequal treaties. On the way through Japan, he saw through the conspiracy of the invaders and was determined to resist. We, the compatriots who died later, can understand it by reading his testament. Later, due to the hardships of travel, the old illness recurred, and in the winter of that year, the condition became more serious. As the unification of the North and South was not achieved, Mr. Sun entrusted his unfinished ambition to the revolutionary comrades who died later on this day fourteen years ago. Mr. Sun's breathing also stopped with his instructions—to save China through peace and struggle.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, I remember there were three testaments: one was for the revolutionary comrades who died later, asking them to continue their efforts and fight together; one was for Madam Sun; and one was for Soviet Russia, hoping that the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union could truly unite after Mr. Sun's death. At that time, there were many revolutionary comrades surrounding Mr. Sun. Some of these comrades have already been implementing Mr. Sun's testament, leading the resistance against the violent ×; however, some have gone down the road of counter-revolution in this difficult journey, shouting about making peace with the invaders. Are these the words of Mr. Sun's revolutionary comrades? They are not only not Mr. Sun's comrades, but also traitors of the Chinese nation. They have even lost the nature of being Chinese. I still remember that when Mr. Sun took office as the Provisional President in Nanjing, someone suggested to Mr. Sun that the handling of external and internal × people should not be too extreme. Mr. Sun immediately replied, "Our purpose is revolution. If the country cannot achieve independence and freedom externally, and the people's lives cannot be resolved internally, then why should we devote ourselves to revolution?" I still remember these words very clearly in my mind, and I also understand very well. I always use them to measure my actions to see if I have violated Mr. Sun's revolutionary proposition. I also remember that thirty-six or seven years ago, when Mr. Sun went to Japan from Honolulu for the second time and began to organize the Tongmenghui, Mr. Liao Zhongkai and I also joined. The overseas students who joined successively came from seventeen provinces. At that time, Mr. Sun proposed nationalism, expelling the Tartars, restoring the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation; proposed democracy, seeking equal political status for all ethnic groups in China, establishing the Republic of China, and establishing a democratic republic; and proposed the people's livelihood, equalizing land ownership and alleviating the painful lives of the people. Because I was very close to Mr. Sun, I understood his revolutionary ideas very thoroughly. The following is continued on page three.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Luoyang, 11th] The situation in the western section of the Longhai Railway is tense, and a unit of our army is reinforcing that area. After the recent major adjustment of the front-line troops, the strength has increased sharply. A commando team has crossed the Yellow River to intercept the Yi. According to a certain source, Hu Yukun has arrived in Kaifeng to take office as the puppet Henan pacification director.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 11th] Xi'an telegram, Jin Yi has recently mobilized again, with some groups, ranging from two to three thousand to a little over a thousand people, or several hundred people, launching offensives in various places and attacking our guerrilla troops. Moreover, Yi has been storing grain, stockpiling weapons, and repairing roads at various railway and highway points, showing active intentions. However, our forces in Jin are larger than those of ×, controlling the overall situation. If a fierce battle breaks out, we will certainly inflict heavy damage on ×. × has established a military base in Heng County, Jinbei. × chieftain Lieutenant General Yanagawa is also in the area. Approximately three to four thousand × in the Fenxi Hua'an, Fencheng, and Tudou areas. After Hongdong × invaded Guyang Village, it first disturbed Qinyuan, and we have taken strict precautions. × advanced from Zhaocheng and was ambushed by us in Yangjiazhuang and Shaguoli, suffering heavy casualties. Ling Shi Yi attacked Jingsheng town, Junzhai village, and also suffered heavy losses. We attacked Gu County, and × was very panicked. After our troops launched surprise attacks everywhere in the territory of Ji and Lu, the fierceness gradually diminished. We have recently made new progress.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chang'an City, 11th] The number of Yi in Gucheng (west of Fencheng) has increased to more than 500 people and are currently in fierce battle with our forces in the Sanggong Village (west of Gucheng) area.</p>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing, 11th] According to Chinese sources, there is currently a fierce battle in Jingle, located northwest of Taiyuan in central Shanxi Province. When the Japanese army attacked the city that day, the Chinese army immediately withdrew. However, after the Japanese army occupied it, the Chinese army returned to surround it, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 10th] It has been raining continuously in southern Hubei and northern Hunan for several days, and the war situation has been quiet. The ×, who continue to occupy Tongcheng and Yuezhou, are still strengthening their fortifications, preparing for a long defense. Observers believe that since × invaded the Hunan-Hubei Highway and the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, they have encountered unprecedented and significant difficulties. The most obvious are as follows: First, our regular army and guerrilla forces are closely monitoring × from all sides, constantly launching surprise attacks and assaults. The deeper they advance, the deeper they sink. The more they retreat, the more thorns they face. Second, in the mountainous area of the Hunan-Hubei border, modern transportation has lost its effectiveness. Climbing over towering mountains not only makes it impossible to move heavy weapons, but even walking is difficult. This kind of revival of primitive-era transportation is by no means something × can get used to. Third, the people are able to unite against the enemy and fight more and more bravely. They are thoroughly aware of the deception and enslavement of ×, and they are able to provide everything they have to meet our needs for punishment and development. The cohesion of the soldiers is even stronger. × has no way to implement their wolfish poison. Therefore, the × who invaded the Hunan-Hubei border area for four months have been consistently rejected in the suburbs of Tongcheng and Yuezhou, without any development.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] President Chiang, concurrently Chairman of the National Defense Supreme Council, recognizing the importance of national spiritual mobilization, previously formulated the Outline of National Spiritual Mobilization, which was submitted to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and personally reported at the Third Congress of the National Political Council. All councilors unanimously and enthusiastically approved it. The aforementioned Outline of National Spiritual Mobilization and Implementation Measures have now been announced by the National Defense Supreme Council and have begun to be implemented. The National Defense Supreme Council has also organized the Spiritual Mobilization Association, which will soon be established. Chairman Chiang concurrently serves as the president and presides over it. In addition, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee passed nine articles of the National Anti-Japanese War Convention, and the Third Congress of the National Political Council supplemented them with three articles, totaling twelve articles, as the National Anti-Japanese War Oath. Now, Chairman Chiang has decided to adopt the original text passed by the National Political Council and named it "National Convention." He has also made it a concrete starting method for national spiritual mobilization by having the people swear to implement the convention. He has specifically incorporated it into the implementation measures so that the people of the country can implement it uniformly. The full text of the outline, the National Convention, and the actual measures of spiritual mobilization are published as follows:</p>
<p>National Convention</p>

If there is any breach of the oath, we are willing to accept the government's punishment. We solemnly swear.</p>
<p>Mobilization Outline</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, more than a year and a half has passed. Relying on the solidarity of our entire country and the courage to sacrifice everything, we have thwarted the arrogance of ×× and depleted the strength of the × army. The reputation of the country has increased, and the world has paid attention. However, the second phase of the War of Resistance has now begun, and the future is long. The efforts required of our people to overcome difficulties will be greater than in the previous phase. Today, × people know that military force is not enough to subdue us and achieve their goal of a quick resolution. Therefore, their most recent plan is to shake our will and threaten our spirit in various ways. We have observed that the historical disasters of our country were all due to the fear of the × people in the spirit of the officials and people, which made them unable to exert the strength of our nation. The lessons of the Song and Ming Dynasties are still fresh in our minds. Therefore, what we should focus on today is the revitalization and concentration of our spirit. In other words, in the previous stage of the War of Resistance, military affairs and spirit were equally important, while in the second and later stages of the War of Resistance, spirit is even more important than military affairs. It is not enough to overcome difficulties and strike at the × people's poisonous plan to win through spiritual control without raising the strong and unyielding spirit of our people. Looking back at the experience of fighting for the past eighteen months and examining its shortcomings, the lack of material conditions is very obvious, but the unpreparedness of spiritual conditions is even more important. Modern warfare is a war of national mobilization. Therefore, we should not only mobilize all the materials and manpower in the country, but also mobilize the spirit of the people of the country. Mobilizing the spirit of the people of the country to enrich the national strength of the War of Resistance is not only about launching, but also about organizing and maintaining. We must use organized spirit to exert organized manpower and organized materials to meet the current needs of the country. Moreover, the meaning of this war of resistance is not only limited to eliminating the invasion of the violent ×, but also to establishing a permanent foundation for post-war reconstruction in the midst of hard fighting. Its task is heavy and its mission is great. It will be an unprecedentedly difficult battle in the history of our country. Looking back at today's society, although the foundation of unity has been established, the unity of spirit has not been achieved. Although there are many performances of loyalty, bravery, and vigor, the state of decadence and dispersion also coexists. The slackness of the organization and the weakness of the foundation are not enough for such a national spirit to bear the great responsibility of the country's prosperity and decline. Therefore, we cannot but recognize that the actual implementation of the national spiritual mobilization is the top priority today. The so-called national spiritual mobilization, from the literal meaning, is to concentrate all the individual's consciousness, thinking, intelligence, and spiritual power in one direction and improve its use. For the whole nation, it is to concentrate the spiritual power of all ages, occupations, thoughts, and lives in one goal, and jointly encourage and increase it, regulate it neatly, and exert it, and determine the center of the organization to enhance its efficiency. The expression of spiritual power is morality, and its expression must be attributed to faith. As the ancients said, "Success comes from one, failure comes from two or three." This is true for everything, especially in military affairs. Moreover, our people are in a wartime where survival is at stake. Therefore, as far as China is concerned today, the national spiritual mobilization should mean concentrating the spirit of the people across the country on a simple common goal, so that the people across the country can establish the same patriotic morality for themselves and firmly establish the same national construction faith for the country. Every member of the people can fight and sacrifice for the same faith based on the same moral concept. What has been stated here seems very ordinary, but the revival of the Chinese nation must follow this path. If we can truly implement national spiritual mobilization in a unified manner, then any difficulty can be shouldered, any difficulty can be overcome, and the final victory is inevitable. Conversely, if the people cannot understand and practice this, or if the understanding is not true and the practice is not consistent, then the national crisis will increase and it will be more difficult to defeat ×. Therefore, the future of the War of Resistance, the fate of the nation, and the success or failure of safety are all tied to the one move of national spiritual mobilization. Therefore, we will elaborate its essentials and discuss them in sections, hoping that our people will accept and practice them in a unified manner.</p>
<p>National spiritual mobilization has three simple and clear common goals that are easy for everyone to understand and practice. It is the spirit that the nation should gather and should be first declared, namely (1) the country first, the nation first, (2) military first, victory first, and (3) concentrated will, concentrated strength.</p>
<p>The Country First, The Nation First</p>
<p>Today, all people, regardless of intelligence, should have a keen sense that in the situation where the survival of the nation is under threat, any individual and their career cannot be guaranteed their safety. The × people's desire to eliminate our people and disintegrate our national unity will first split us and then enslave and eliminate us. Their ambitions and poisonous plans have become increasingly clear. Therefore, consolidating national survival should be prior to everything else. However, the highest system of national life is the state. Without the state, national life cannot be maintained and developed. The people who lose their country are like the Jews, who are slaughtered by others. How tragic. Therefore, consolidating the state should be even more important than everything else. Therefore, we must recognize today that the country is first, the nation is first, and the interests of the country and the nation should be higher than everything else. Before the country and the nation, we should sacrifice all selfish opinions, selfish hearts, selfish interests, and even sacrifice personal freedom and life.</p>
<p>Military First, Victory First</p>
<p>In this military period of resolving the survival of the nation, the greatest interest of the country and the nation is the military interest. Therefore, all the thoughts and actions of the people should be absolutely subject to the control of the military interests of the country and the nation. In order to achieve the interests of the military and to increase the interests of the military, the country and the nation may require the people to make all sacrifices, and the people must also automatically and enthusiastically contribute everything they have. Therefore, it is said that the military is first. The only purpose of the military is to seek victory. Therefore, the people must establish the belief in victory and achieve the purpose of final victory. They must also devote all their knowledge and all their time and energy to seek military victory. In this period, there should be no so-called personal gains and losses, personal interests, or personal humiliation and honor. Only seeking military victory is the glory shared by all our people, and the failure to achieve victory is the greatest shame for everyone. All merits and demerits, all right and wrong, should be judged by this standard. Therefore, it is also said that victory is first.</p>
<p>Concentrated Will, Concentrated Strength</p>
<p>When our country is in a time of national emergency and self-defense, all the wills of the people should be concentrated and all the strengths should be concentrated. The rational and conscientious people should have no time for other thoughts or actions except to do their best to consolidate the country and seek victory. As far as the country and the nation are concerned, it is also necessary to require the absolute unity of thought of the whole people, concentrating on the country first, the nation first, and the military first, victory first. No divergence or doubt is allowed, and no other fantasies or empty theories are allowed. It is even more necessary to mobilize all the people of all professions and departments to concentrate on fighting for the military interests of the country and the nation. In the midst of hardships, each should do his best and do his job to improve everything and create everything, so as to implement the long-term military plan and at the same time achieve the completion of our national construction work. Therefore, it is said that the will is concentrated and the strength is concentrated. The above three meanings are very simple and clear, and things are extremely easy to do. The people must be happy to accept and accept them in a unified manner. Please elaborate on the content of the same principle and the same belief that we ask to establish (to be continued).</p>

<p>[Hong Kong News] In January this year, China's trade with various countries, imports and exports of goods, have increased compared with the same period last year. This shows that the credit of various countries to us has not been affected by our country being in a period of war, but has instead increased day by day. This makes the future of our final victory brighter and more assured. According to the Customs Import Trade Statistics Monthly Report, the total value of China's imports in January this year was 85.34 million national currency, an increase of 25.965 million yuan compared with the same period last year. The total value of exports in January this year was 28.212 million yuan, an increase of 9.061 million yuan compared with the same period last year. The import surplus in January this year was 17.546 million yuan, an increase of 1.318 million yuan compared with the same period last year.

<h3 id="e11">× In North China (Below) Currency Policy Failure: North China People's Faith in Legal Tender Fades; Confession of Mitsuchi Chuzo, a Japanese <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Many Methods</p>
<p>To overcome the aforementioned currency obstacles in North China, and in fact, many methods have already been implemented, in order to encourage the people to trust the new banknotes, the "United Reserve Bank" must obtain a sufficient amount of foreign currency deposits, and when necessary, use these foreign currencies to sell foreign exchange. Japanese financial commissioners stationed in China and the management department of the "United Reserve Bank" are currently making hopeful efforts to increase the "Bank's" strength in this regard. For the same purpose, the North China "authorities" have adopted a foreign exchange control system and implemented certain restrictions on foreign trade. A more pressing and specific issue is how to deal with the end of the old legal tender circulation period in March. As mentioned above, as of now,</p>
<p>400 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Only 13 million yuan has been recovered. The course of action thereafter will largely depend on the situation at the end of the period, but no matter what method is taken, the legal tender that has been in circulation for a long time may continue to circulate. The currency problem in Central China is quite similar to that in North China. Our country's (referring to Japan's) military expenses are still paid with "military scrip." But in general, the people's trust in "military scrip" is by no means higher than the North China people's trust in the "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, and in some inland areas, the Japanese military authorities have had to purchase legal tender with their own banknotes before they can purchase anything. It was previously predicted that after the fall of Guangzhou, the legal tender would depreciate, but the fact is</p>
<p>Quite the Opposite</p>
<p>The value of legal tender has instead risen, and legal tender has become a heavy burden on the Japanese bank notes in the aforementioned form. The strength of the legal tender may be due to the efforts of HSBC. No matter what happens to Chiang Kai-shek's fate, the value of legal tender will still be maintained, because there is a surplus between imports and exports. The Japanese army will continue to purchase goods with "military scrip," which will be converted into legal tender, and then the legal tender will be exchanged for foreign currency. Therefore, the fundamental problem is how to deal with legal tender. This clearly requires the establishment of a bank in Central China that issues independent banknotes. Although this bank does not need to operate on a large scale, it should be sufficiently strong from the beginning to be able to temporarily disregard the legal tender, and attempt to recover it during a designated period, as was done in North China, and should directly strive to increase foreign commerce. The "bank" among the great powers may increase its foreign currency deposits. This "bank" should not be a purely Chinese institution, but a joint venture of Chinese and Japanese capital, and its new banknotes should not be linked to Japanese bank notes like the "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. The reason for this is obvious. If the "bank" is prepared to sell foreign exchange, then its exchange value can be allowed to follow its own course. (End)</p>

<p>[Reuter's Tokyo, 11th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita declared in the Japanese Parliament last night that Japan must study whether it is appropriate to lodge a protest with Britain regarding the establishment of a £10 million fund to stabilize Chinese currency. He said that the Japanese government believes that although this fund is intended to stabilize Chinese legal tender to guarantee British economic interests, its effect will inevitably strengthen the "Chiang regime."</p>
<p>[Reuter's Peiping, 11th] After the new currency law of the pseudo-"Preparation Bank" began to be implemented here yesterday, the market was extremely chaotic. Today it has been calmer. Officials formally announced that Peiping, Tianjin, Yantai and Qingdao are also included in the "Preparation Bank Zone." According to reliable sources from responsible parties, the Japanese Chambers of Commerce in North China have telegraphed Tokyo, requesting that the implementation of this new law be postponed, and at least hope that the aforementioned four major cities will not be subject to it for the time being, but it has not been approved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 10th] Peiping News: The Chinese newspapers here do not publish any text regarding the establishment of the Sino-British loan, which may be due to the extensive adverse publicity by the newspapers in recent days. According to foreign banking circles, the price of Chinese legal tender has become more stable due to the loan, and the price of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes will secretly fall. As for the general Chinese people, they are even more unwilling to exchange their savings of legal tender for the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank.</p>

<p>— He Xiangning</p>
<p>At the same time, revolutionary enthusiasm was also high. We deeply felt his influence when we traveled to various overseas Chinese communities, and it was particularly profound. Therefore, at this moment when the national liberation war against the invaders is entering a new and favorable stage, we are, however, a country that has been in political chaos for more than twenty years, and we can estimate the difficult future ahead. However, knowing ourselves and knowing our enemy, our responsibility is significant, our work should not be delayed for a moment, and our strength must be concentrated. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we should earnestly implement the revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the three major policies that Mr. Sun resolutely advocated—alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers.</p>
<p>All people of the Republic of China, revolutionary comrades of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and people with conscience, should assume the responsibility of realizing Mr. Sun's unfinished revolutionary aspirations. In order to realize Mr. Sun's Principle of Democracy, we must eliminate the corrupt officials and bureaucrats in various places, and the public officials who deceive those above and oppress those below, and realize the establishment of local councils as soon as possible, so that the general public can contribute more concrete opinions to the government's implementation of resisting the invaders' demands, so that the people's power of all ethnic groups, parties, and social strata in the country can be completely gathered into the mainstream of the government's resistance against the invaders; so that some forces will not be wasted; ××××××××. To seek the final victory of the national liberation war, establish a republic of the Three Principles of the People, and achieve the true realization of the Principle of Democracy.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a compassionate person who deeply hated those who used their power to oppress others. Therefore, from the research of the new political trends in the world, he put forward this Principle of People's Livelihood. He wanted to thoroughly realize this principle, so that everyone could obtain the status of being a human being, and everyone could obtain the living materials of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. But now the invaders want to destroy our Chinese nation, and want to degrade our status as human beings to the status of being cows and horses, to the status of slaves in the fifteenth century. We also recognize the true face of the invaders, ××××××××, ... Then, we, the comrades and compatriots who are conducting the commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen today, should deeply understand the true meaning of Mr. Sun's revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the three major policies, and should not use personal prejudices to prevent implementation or lack the courage to fully implement them, ××××××, that would be tantamount to making our liberation war even more difficult. These are all symptoms of the War of Resistance against Japan, and we should loudly call for them to be corrected.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a few more words to say: The reason why the Republic of China was able to be established. From my point of view, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous struggle is one of them. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in this difficult revolutionary war of national liberation, Mr. Sun's spirit of struggle is worthy of everyone's earnest study. The establishment of the Republic of China, and the fact that the people of the whole country were able to be relieved of the suffering of imperial oppression, was due to the willingness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the general revolutionary patriots to sacrifice their blood and make the determination to succeed or die for the cause. Therefore, it was possible to more widely arouse the enthusiasm of patriots throughout the country to respond and participate, this is the second point. ××××××, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, everyone should rise up with a sacrificial determination and participate in the work of saving the country ××××× to persevere in the war of resistance, to support the war of resistance to the end, and to strive for the final victory. Also, I remember that after the establishment of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), many comrades were sent to various places to solicit donations. Overseas Chinese destroyed their homes and donated money, and this call was echoed from one another. Afterwards, the Republic of China was able to be established, and the strength of the overseas Chinese accounted for one-third of the total. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we should know even more the difficulties of creating the Republic of China. Overseas Chinese in various places, in particular, should remember the merits of responding to Mr. Sun's revolution by destroying their homes and donating money, and continue to donate money, so that this ×× war can receive more economic assistance. At the same time, overseas Chinese should also fully assist in the establishment of military industries and the development of national defense economy, so that the government can obtain all the resources to resist the ×× invaders. At the same time, whether they are officials or civilians, they should reflect on the accumulation of their own private property, whether there is a hint of making a fortune from the national crisis, everyone should ask their conscience, and now, with the devastation before our eyes, can we turn a blind eye to it? If the country is destroyed, even if there is private property, it is useless. The result of the Jewish people's self-interest is a good warning for us. Today, let us donate more money to the country, to help the refugees, and to the soldiers who have been wounded and returned from the front line. As we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we must learn Mr. Sun's spirit of struggle, revolution, integrity, selflessness, and benevolence to complete the great cause of national liberation and establish an independent and free modern country.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Czech Government Declares It Can Control the Overall Situation; Tiso and Tsukamazan Go to Germany for Help; Hitler Convenes a Meeting to Discuss <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Reuter's Berlin, 11th] It is reported that German leader Hitler convened his closest advisors at midnight yesterday for a meeting to discuss the Czech incident.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Prague, 10th] Some sources say that the German minority in Slovakia seems to be encouraging the Slovak extremist faction to break away from the Czech Federal Government, but Berlin does not seem to approve of these radicals. The visit to Germany by two recently dismissed Slovak ministers has failed. Former Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and other former ministers were escorted home by the police separately. The news of the arrest of the extremist leaders has been confirmed.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Basle, 10th] According to semi-official sources, former Slovak Minister Chankansky and German minority leader Tsukamazan arrived in Vienna together today. It is rumored that Tukansky's trip is to appeal to Hitler on behalf of the Slovak people, but the political circles have not heard of it. However, the general psychological perception is that Tukansky bears this mission to some extent. Although the official side has remained silent on the Slovak incident, the political circles and the Berlin newspapers seem to express full sympathy for the Slovak people.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Vienna, 10th] It is reported that Chankansky has left Austria for Berlin to meet Hitler. Before his departure, he broadcast a speech here, accusing the ministers of the new Slovak government of being traitors to the Slovak people, and declared that Czechia's intervention in Slovakia's internal affairs this time is constitutionally inappropriate.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Vienna, 10th] According to another report, Tukansky did not go to Berlin, but went to Bratislava.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Peking, 10th] It is reported that before going to Vienna, Mr. Tsukamazan, the leader of the German minority in the Slovak region, gave a speech in front of his office to 45,000 German demonstrators, saying, "Our German ethnic group, under the protection of the leader, should take joint action with the Slovak people to restore peace and order here." At the same time, it is also learned that Mr. Mauga, the director of the political department of the Linke Guard, who was wanted by the Czech government, recently declared that "The Czech government's actions are the greatest deception in the history of the Slovak people." He called for a joint effort with the German people to fight for a free Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Slovak Prime Minister Dismissed; Conflict Between Linke Guard and Czech Army in the Central District of Bratislava</p>
<p>[Reuter's Prague, 10th] The Czech government declares that the Slovak autonomous movement is under control. Deputy Prime Minister Schiferik, who had been ordered to go to Rome to attend the Pope's coronation ceremony, has also been recalled and appointed as Prime Minister to replace Mr. Tiso. It is heard that Tiso is protesting to Hitler about his dismissal by the Czech government. Some members of the disbanded Linke Guard have been placed under house arrest in the barracks, and others have been sent to Moravia. The Slovak capital of Bratislava had a small riot this morning, but it has now calmed down. However, heavy troops are still stationed at the railway station. The authorities strictly prohibit the publication of newspapers, and the military officers prohibit people from listening to foreign broadcasts. The conflict between Slovakia and Czechia cannot be said to have been resolved.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Prague, 10th] Bratislava Radio Station said that the newly established provisional government has been overthrown, and the Czech military police have also withdrawn. Czech Deputy Prime Minister broadcast a speech saying that the turmoil between Slovakia and Czechia will be resolved within 24 hours.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Budapest, 10th] According to news from Bratislava, Slovakia will ask Hitler to represent them and intervene with the Czech government. The reason for the sudden aggravation of this matter is that Slovak extremists were found to be plotting to declare the Independent State of Slovakia and secede from Czechia. Germany occupies a major position in all the changes in Czechia. At the very least, the Czech government would never take strong steps to dismiss the Slovak Prime Minister without the prior consent of Germany. After this conflict, it will be difficult for the Czech and Slovak governments to cooperate again. It is also reported that the Linke Guard's attempt to overthrow the local government and establish a military dictatorship has failed since the mechanized infantry entered Bratislava this morning.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Latakia, 10th] Martial law is only implemented in the Pastern area and does not involve Bratislava. Before Vice President Sidor went to Bratislava, he declared that the power to decide on the Slovak issue should be in Bratislava and not in Prague.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Bratislava, 11th] Yesterday afternoon, near the office of the Labor Federation in the central district of this city, the Linke Guard clashed with the Czech army. One member of the Linke Guard died and three were injured. The demonstration here has now increased even more. The situation in various parts of Slovakia is also very tense.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Bratislava, 10th] At 11:00 a.m. today, martial law was implemented everywhere, and the army began to occupy public buildings in Bratislava, Piestany, and Trencin. At the same time, the Czech government has appointed a Czech soldier to assist and instruct the Slovak government. This morning, thousands of Linke Guards and workers gathered in front of the government buildings to demonstrate and protest against the dismissal of the Prime Minister. Several shots were fired immediately. Nationalist workers from major Slovak factories, including the wire, rubber, and gunpowder industries, announced a strike and participated in the Slovak patriotic youth group's demonstration in Bratislava. The military authorities immediately took precautions to prevent workers and farmers in the countryside from getting involved in the strike. Most of the troops were brought from non-Slovak regions in trucks and cars this morning. Troops are also on their way here from Bohemia and Moravia. Telephone lines in this city and the outside world have been cut off. They were restored at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Prague, 10th] Disturbances broke out in the Slovak region today. The Linke Guard clashed with the police, injuring two people. The police immediately restored order. By the afternoon, everything had calmed down. A large group of Linke supporters and rebellious workers gathered in front of the government buildings, shouting, "We demand a free and independent Czechoslovakia," "Slovak Hitler," referring to Hitler. After the Munich Conference, Czechia became chaotic. The dismissal of Slovak Prime Minister Tiso this time is a resolute method to restore Czech national independence and integrity. At 12:30 p.m., Finance Minister Tauberansky began to be responsible for ruling the Slovak government, pending Schiferik's return, and gave a broadcast speech, urging the people to maintain order.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Bratislava, 11th] Slovak Government Vice President Sidor, who was arrested yesterday, was released in the evening. He gave a speech to the crowd on the terrace of the Carlton Hotel. He is now participating in discussions to organize a constructive government to replace the current one, and said that he is prepared to work hard to find a compromise solution with the nationalist faction. By night, the situation here had calmed down. At 9:00 p.m., the martial law was lifted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Vienna, 11th] Radio broadcasts said that disturbances had occurred south of Kveta, near Peterwhist, and troops were needed to go to suppress them. At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, German troops had crossed the Danube River bridge and invaded Bratislava in large numbers. However, the Berlin Propaganda Department has strongly denied this.</p>
<p>French Political Circles Maintain Conservative Silence</p>
<p>British Experts Believe Czech Coup Is Not a Purely Natural Movement of the People</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Paris, 11th] Political circles maintain conservative silence on the coup in Czechia, and newspapers have not criticized it. Political circles particularly pointed out that France's attention to Czechia has been greatly reduced since the Munich Conference. The military agreement between France and Czechia no longer exists. The French government has notified Germany that it is not interested in the political situation in Czechia.</p>
<p>[Reuter's London, 11th] A diplomatic observer here said, "The Slovak coup against the Czech government, which failed, is enough to show that the Czech issue has not been completely resolved since the Munich Conference. European politicians are very troubled by the inside story of the coup. Experts in general do not believe that this move is a purely natural movement of the people. There are many Slovaks who are unwilling to unite with Czechia, and it cannot be denied that they have expressed dissatisfaction with the Czech government on a daily basis. Although the German newspapers condemned Czech President Hodelcher's resolute steps to suppress the rebellion, Germany may not necessarily support the rebellion. It is noteworthy that the dismissed Slovak Prime Minister Tiso, representing the Slovak independence movement, asked the German government for assistance. The world is now waiting for Germany's reply. Although Slovakia has recently shown that it is not as dependent on Germany as it used to be, it is difficult to predict what benefits Germany hopes to obtain after it secedes from Czechia. The resolution of the Slovak movement may have considerable links with the fate of Little Russia, which has not yet been decided."</p>
<h3 id="e17">British Government Makes Efforts to Adjust the European Situation; End of Spanish War Will Be a Prerequisite; Conference to Limit Armaments May Be Convened <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Reuter's London, 10th] Political visitors here are unanimously optimistic about the overall European situation this morning. All evening newspapers have published articles commenting on the possibility of convening a conference to limit armaments. The "Reuter's" diplomatic visitor declared that it is the general intention of London that the Spanish War can no longer be prolonged and will be an important prerequisite for adjusting the overall European situation. The past tense atmosphere may be a lesson for France and Italy, so that the relationship between the two sides can be adjusted as soon as possible. The British government is still working hard, hoping to carry out the entire movement to limit armaments. At the same time, London does not express importance to the news that Italy has informally made requests to France. The general public agrees with the visitor's view that the talks between France and Italy may focus on the treatment of Italian expatriates in Gibraltar and Tunisia. However, it is believed that there will be no particular difficulties in the talks between the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Italy Sends Diplomatic Note to France, Briefly Outlining Its Demands <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press London, 10th] According to reliable diplomatic sources, Italy will send a diplomatic note to France in the middle of this week, briefly outlining its demands regarding Gibraltar, the Addis Ababa Railway, and Tunisia. It is said that the diplomatic note is much more moderate than the clamor of the Italian newspapers. This has gradually made the general public believe that Chamberlain's attempt to convene a world conference on the limitation of armaments before autumn of this year is indeed possible. It is said that Chamberlain will first discuss the limitation of air force with European countries, and then invite the United States and other countries to participate in the discussion. In addition to the limitation of all armaments, economic issues and the German colonial issue will also be included to ease the general situation. At present, Britain and France have gradually revealed an optimistic atmosphere, because it is generally believed that the end of the Spanish War, as stated by Chamberlain, can improve the general situation. According to recent news from Rome and Paris, the officials of the two countries have denied the above-mentioned rumors about Italy sending a diplomatic note to France.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Britain and Italy Will Re-Discuss the Mediterranean Issue <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 10th] The prerequisite for the future diplomatic activities in Europe will be the resolution of the Spanish situation. Once General Franco occupies Madrid, Chamberlain will seize the opportunity to re-discuss the situation in the Mediterranean with Mussolini. This was originally planned during Chamberlain's visit to Italy. The signs of this development have long been revealed. First of all, the issue of Italian volunteers in Spain must be resolved. It is to adjust the Franco-Italian disputes to ease the tension in Europe for months. In fact, France may see Mussolini obtain some satisfaction in Tunisia, Gibraltar, the Addis Ababa Railway, and the Suez Canal, but everything will not happen automatically until Mussolini makes a formal request. It has been suggested that the Franco-Italian talks can be divided into two parts. The first part does not discuss land claims, and the second part does discuss land claims. This is obviously not agreed to by France. If Mussolini's attitude is slightly more moderate, Chamberlain's plan to limit armaments may succeed.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Reuters has learned from authoritative sources that the Jewish delegation to the Palestine Conference will meet with British representatives this afternoon. At that time, the British side will respond to the draft proposal previously submitted by the administrative department of the Jewish Congress. It is generally believed that whether the Jews will terminate or continue discussions with the British side will depend on the nature of the response.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] According to a Reuters reporter, the Jewish delegation delivered a notice to the British government today, stating that the Jewish representatives cannot accept an independent Palestine dominated by Arabs. It further stated that any proposal that does not guarantee the growth of the Jewish national homeland will not be considered by the Jewish representatives as a basis for continued discussion. However, Jewish figures are quite concerned that the British government's final recommendations will not differ much from the proposal made a year ago.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] Hitler will travel to Austria on the 13th of this month to attend the celebrations commemorating the first anniversary of the German-Austrian merger.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 10th] In commemoration of the anniversary of the German-Austrian merger, an amnesty has been granted, and 300 political prisoners of Aryan descent were released today. However, former Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and former Mayor Kermis are not among them, and no Jews have been invited for release.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] It is reported that Dr. Schacht, the former president of the German National Bank, will embark on a journey tomorrow. Schacht's trip will not directly go to India; he will make brief stops in Italy and Egypt along the way and will go to India around the end of the month.

<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The report of the British Imperial Shipping Committee mentions the threat of Japanese merchant ships to British shipping in the East, stating that Japan's eastern trade transport volume through the Panama Canal has increased by about two-fifths, while Britain's has decreased from one-third to two-fifths, and the United States' has decreased from one-third to one-eighth. The reason for the increase in Japanese merchant ships is the increase in business between Japan, and the special measures taken by the Japanese government to support Japanese merchant ships. According to statistics from 1936, the operating expenses of Japanese ships were about 10% to 15% less than those of British ships. The report continues to call on British ships to improve their equipment so that they can compete with foreign ships for passengers and to make major adjustments in management, strengthening Eastern agencies, which is one of the key factors. "This move is greatly related to naval and economic defense in both wartime and peacetime. Without merchant shipping, what would be the use of the army and air force stationed in Singapore? Whether the future of British commerce and banking interests in the Far East is promising still depends on whether British ships have the capacity to expand British commerce to the East."</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The trial of the recent bombing case in Manchester, England, has concluded. Those convicted include five men and one woman. Campbell, the ringleader, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Mary Green (female) was sentenced to seven years in prison. The other four men, namely Connell, Duggan, Green, and Gavahan, were each sentenced to 20 years in prison. One person was acquitted. When the ringleader Campbell was convicted, he said, "Excellent, I am being punished for a noble cause. I will come back. May God save Ireland." After Mary was convicted, she shouted loudly, "May God save Ireland!" The prison guard immediately covered her mouth with his hand and took her away. Gavahan also shouted, "May God save Ireland!" Duggan then shouted "The Republic rises!"</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] In his speech at the 18th Congress of the Soviet Union, Stalin quoted former US President Roosevelt's saying "Speak softly and carry a big stick" to elucidate his peace policy, saying that the Soviet Union is willing to engage in commercial exchanges with all countries that do not harm the interests of the Soviet Union, and warns those who criticize the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union has a strong army, navy, and air force. He also ridiculed the ineffectiveness of the Anti-Comintern Pact and declared that the handling of aggressor nations by Britain and France has failed. It is inappropriate for British, French, and North American newspapers to provoke disputes between Germany and the Soviet Union over Ukraine. In short, the Soviet Union's foreign policy is as follows: (1) Maintain peace and develop commerce with all countries; (2) Suppress actions that provoke war; (3) Strengthen the Soviet Union's military power; (4) Promote friendship between the Soviet Union and all peaceful countries.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 10th] The Communist army in the eastern district of the city engaged in fierce fighting with the mechanized motorcade led by General Michaya in the city's eastern square. Both sides used tanks. General Michaya admitted that he had occupied the square. Troops under the jurisdiction of the Defense Committee are now opening up pillars from the city center to help fight there. The rebel army is in danger of being heavily besieged.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 10th] British Home Secretary Hoare delivered a speech today, saying, "Britain cannot be defeated in one fell swoop by the enemy in a short-term war, but in a long-term war, our inexhaustible resources will guarantee our final victory," and so on.</p>

The British government will be represented by representatives of the army, navy, and air force, among whom Army Representative General Squire and Navy Representative Rear Admiral Colvin have arrived in the Commonwealth of Australia. The Commonwealth of Canada, because it can supply the autonomous territories in the Pacific with aircraft coaches in the future, just like it supplies the British headquarters, may also send personnel to participate in the conference.</p>

<p>The All-England Aid China Congress began in London on the evening of the 10th and the situation was unusually enthusiastic. We believe that the following are particularly noteworthy:</p>
<p>First, the Bishop of York addressed the conference and expressed great respect for the heroic struggle of the Chinese people against Japan. This shows that our country's perseverance in the war of resistance not only enhances our country's international status, but also makes the international community realize that our country's war of resistance is also to defend world peace, increasing international sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Second, the Bishop of York also loudly pointed out: "The organized great powers have not yet been able to find a way to end their suffering, and I am ashamed of it." This is obviously a sad question aimed at compromise diplomacy. However, we want to solemnly inform the world that while we deeply appreciate the noble intentions of the international community to end our suffering, there is no other way to follow other than to impose effective sanctions on the aggressors and murderers!</p>
<p>Third, Miss. Philip, the chairman of the conference, specifically pointed out the serious threat to the lives of the British people from the aggressors in the Far East attacking China. She also said: "If Japan wins, one-fifth of humanity will become semi-slaves!" This is a warning. It is by no means alarmist, which shows that the British people are gradually awakening!</p>
<p>The international community is staging a great people's movement, which has been and is expanding the aid China movement, in order to fulfill everyone's responsibility in humanity and justice. How should our compatriots across the country, especially overseas Chinese who are spared from the disaster of artillery fire, restrain all unnecessary consumption and dedicate all their strength to saving the suffering of the motherland!</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] According to the Commercial Daily, after the signing of the agreement between the United States and Brazil, economic circles are discussing granting a credit loan to Chile.

<h3 id="e31">Nazi Tyranny on the Rise <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Shichang, original author Harold Callender, published in the February issue of "Modern Historical Materials"</p>
<p>In Germany, it is very difficult for people to hear criticism of politics, because they are all forced to defend Hitler and cannot express the slightest dissatisfaction. Everywhere, the secret police are loyal to their duties, eavesdropping on telephones, opening letters, and closely monitoring suspicious people. The people of Germany know that these official secret agents are everywhere, so they avoid using telephones except for trivial calls, in order to avoid all kinds of troubles. However, they know very well the path that Germany is taking now, and they repeatedly express their hope that foreign countries can suppress the Nazi "explosion."</p>
<p>Nazi Germany has been vigorously strengthening its power and severely criticizing Britain and the United States; however, domestic unrest and fear are revealed everywhere. Foreign countries are also gradually disbelieving Germany's self-praise. At present, Germany believes that it can suppress domestic dissatisfaction; it is not necessary to worry about foreign opposition for the time being.</p>
<p>I recently visited Germany and traveled through ten major cities in the southwest and northeast. I gained some impressions: people in various parts of Germany, even those in the Nazi class, expressed shock, dissatisfaction, and shame at the November riots (referring to the anti-Jewish movement—translator) and the things done in the name of the German people. They deeply hate the official claim that anti-Jewish behavior is a natural move of German public opinion. At the same time, seeing the evolution of recent events, they are alarmed about the future of Germany. They hope that foreign countries will adopt a tougher attitude towards Germany. They know that they are powerless, because the power of the Nazis is too violent. If they are dissatisfied, there is no doubt that they will be imprisoned.</p>
<p>The German people unanimously hate war. At the same time, they believe that if Germany participates in a war, it will definitely be very short, because the German people do not want war, and the Nazi rule may be reduced because of the war. Therefore, Hitler's greatest success is winning without fighting and achieving his desired goals without fighting. In this way, Germany's national strength is increasing day by day. The German people, not Nazi officials, even those who deeply hate domestic tyranny, also feel happy, because this is a victory achieved without war. However, the dangers of Nazi foreign policy cannot be ignored, and many of these dangers have already been realized.</p>
<p>Catholics are forced to stop children from attending Catholic schools; the salaries of Protestant pastors have also been greatly reduced by the authorities, and they are even prepared to refuse to pay them; church property and houses will be confiscated; church taxes will continue to be levied and used for non-religious businesses; church pastors will be in danger of being arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit revolution. Catholicism is being heavily attacked by the Nazis.</p>
<p>What annoys the Germans the most is the lack of food. Most of them are unwilling to sacrifice butter to build cannons. Each person can only eat a quarter of a pound of butter per week. Eggs are extremely rare. Better quality food is not available; bread seems to be whiter than a year ago, but, according to knowledgeable housewives, the ingredients are even worse. People in various parts of Germany are complaining about unreasonable taxes and forced donations.</p>
<p>In order to expand its military, Germany is tightening its belt in all aspects. Especially for kitchens and dining rooms, there is a great impact. In Germany's big hotels and restaurants, the food that Germans can get is not as good as what a restaurant in a small republic with a weaker military can supply. However, they clearly know that the country stores a variety of rich foods. The German's appetite is also not free. Germany treats foreigners differently. Foreigners in German large hotels can have a quarter of a pound of butter every day - the amount that Germans can get every week - a kind foreigner will definitely invite his German friends to dine with him in the room, and at the same time, after the meal, tie up the butter with an oilcloth and put it in his friend's pocket, in this way, he will surely receive a great welcome!</p>
<p>Germany is also very short of fresh fruits. Although the stored fruits can meet the needs of foreign travelers, women who know these things say that many fruits are mixed with loaded guns to save the continuous shortage, so there are not many fresh fruits.</p>
<p>If a foreigner runs out of a comfortable German hotel and sets up a family by himself, he will definitely have food problems and will not be able to get delicious and nourishing food. Housewives all complain about the lack of butter, eggs, fresh leaves, vegetables, wheat, flour, sugar, etc. Working-class women feel that food is more expensive, and they dare not ask about meat.</p>
<p>Do Germans like this kind of life? Of course not; however, it doesn't matter much, Germans simply cannot manage Germany!</p>

<h3 id="e32">14th Anniversary of the Premier's Death: All Sectors of Hong Kong to Solemnly Commemorate Today; Commemorative Meeting to be Held at the Queen's Theatre at 10:30 AM; He Xiangning to Serve as Chairman and Sell Commemorative Badges to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of the death of the Premier. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have held solemn commemorations every year on this day to express their condolences. It is now scheduled to hold a meeting at the Queen's Theatre at 10:30 am today, with Ms. He Xiangning serving as the chairman of the meeting, and Mr. Ye Gongchuo, Chuan Bingchang, Luo Yiqun, and other revolutionary pioneers who stayed in Hong Kong will be invited to speak about the Premier's life and deeds. At the same time, commemorative badges will be sold to raise funds for disaster relief. Li Xiangen, an old comrade of the Kuomintang, wrote two poems yesterday to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the Premier's death. The poem says, "It is difficult to forget the time of being given arrows; ten years have passed, one remains. I regret chasing the poor thieves in the report; it is futile to fight the ugly barbarians. The heart of the country is seen by the world; how can the tears of Chequan be the private tears of party members? The survival of the motherland is now like a thread; the awe-inspiring spirit has knowledge. It has been said since ancient times that hardship builds a nation, but I am deeply saddened that this is unprecedented; the wars are raging for thousands of miles, and the wind and rain are bleak for fourteen years. The legacy is still in my ears, and I only think of remembering the whip clearly. Strive for peace to save China, dare to tell the people not to disgrace their ancestors." The order of today's commemorative meeting of all sectors is as follows: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the national anthem; (3) Bow three times to the party and national flag and Sun Premier's portrait; (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Observe a three-minute silence for the national martyrs and the compatriots who died in the disaster; (6) The chairman delivers the opening speech; (7) The chairman reports the brief history of Sun Premier's life; (8) Speech; (9) Lecture; (10) Ceremony ends; (11) Meeting adjourns.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Murder Case Occurs on Peel Street: Worker from the South China Morning Post Stabbed and Seriously Injured; British Soldiers and Chinese Involved in a Major Brawl in Wan Chai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Mai Wang, a 30-year-old compositor at the South China Morning Post, lived at No. 32 Peel Street, ground floor. At 1:20 am yesterday morning, Mai finished work and returned home. When he turned from City God Street onto Peel Street, he was suddenly approached by a thug armed with a sharp knife who lunged out of the darkness and stabbed Mai repeatedly in the back without saying a word. Mai turned around to resist and was stabbed in the right hand. Blood flowed profusely, and he fell to the ground with serious injuries. The assailant, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled the scene. Later, a passerby discovered this, called the police station to report the case. After receiving the report, the police sent a large number of detectives to the scene to investigate, sent the injured to Mary Hospital for treatment, and strictly pursued the murderer in the case. Also, at about midnight yesterday morning, a brawl occurred in front of the Navy and Army Club in Wan Chai. The incident was caused by a British sailor who was passing by in a rickshaw, claiming that a Chinese person threw a stone at him. He quickly got out of the car to negotiate and was attacked by another Chinese person. At that time, the sailors on the roadside joined the brawl one after another, and a melee broke out. Residents nearby did not know what was happening and suspected it was a robbery, so they whistled to call the police, and by the time an Indian policeman arrived, the brawlers had dispersed. It is reported that as a result, one Chinese person was beaten severely injured and later sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

Since the end of February this year, the remaining faculty and staff members in Hong Kong have set up an office in Hong Kong to handle and send faculty and staff members to Yunnan in batches. As of today, 17 batches of faculty and staff members have departed from Hong Kong to Yunnan, totaling more than 800 people. The 15th batch of faculty and staff members departed on the Guangdong wheel yesterday, totaling 41 people. The 16th and 17th batches of faculty and staff members will depart today on the Yongsheng Huanyang wheel, transfer to Haiphong, and enter Yunnan. There are still more than 100 faculty and staff members remaining in Hong Kong. Due to the quota relationship, they will also be allowed to depart in full before the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Hong Kong Authorities Pay Special Attention to the Development of Tour Guide Agencies; Magistrate Describes Them as a Disguised Form of Prostitution <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities have recently paid special attention to the tour guide agencies in Hong Kong. A certain magistrate once criticized the nature of tour guide agencies, saying that they are "nothing more than a disguised form of prostitution." The number of tour guide agencies established in Hong Kong is extremely booming. There are already 35 well-known ones, employing a total of more than 400 tour guides, and more than 100 unemployed women seek jobs at tour guide agencies every day. Most of these people are refugees from Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shantou, and Xiamen who have fallen into Hong Kong, and some even come from mainland China. After arriving in Hong Kong, because the cost of living in Hong Kong is too high, and it is not easy to find a job, it is not easy to maintain a living, so they are forced to seek a way out in this. Many also change careers to become tour guides to make a living. The existence of tour guides in Hong Kong actually began with Japanese hostesses. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese tour guide agencies have been established to replace them. Previously, Japanese people often invited hostesses to meetings to help, or to chat and drink, or to sing to entertain, nominally selling sex but not the body. Since the outbreak of the war, most of these hostesses have been recalled to their country to comfort the "Imperial Army." The former Japanese hostesses charged two yuan per hour for being invited to serve guests, which is more than double the current tour guides.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Strict Attention to Crack Down on Counterfeit National Products: Overseas Chinese in the Philippines; Strict Attention: Ship Goods in Hong Kong and Shanghai, Inspect Bills of Lading, Severe Penalties for Violators; One Dollar Debt Repayment Campaign Achieves Good Results <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>A certain small Luzon in this sea recently received a flying mail from the Luzon Commercial Bank, stating that the Philippine Overseas Chinese Aid Committee is paying attention to the purchase of goods from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and other places in order to crack down on counterfeit national products, and has formulated regulations. All commercial firms purchasing goods domestically must have the bill of lading inspected by the Executive Committee of the Committee, and report to the Committee for inspection when the goods arrive before they can be loaded. If a commercial firm has ordered goods from Hong Kong, Shanghai, Zhangzhou, or Quanzhou in the past and does not follow the regulations, the bill of lading will be submitted to the Committee for reporting and inspection, and if there is evidence of a violation, a fine of 100 Philippine pesos will be imposed.</p>
<p>Recently discovered that it is counterfeit</p>
<p>And from March 1, if the domestic goods received by each commercial firm are not submitted and reported for inspection, the first time will be fined half of the value of the goods, and the second time will be fined the full value of the goods. The Philippine Overseas Chinese Aid Committee has formulated this regulation because it has recently discovered that many of the so-called national products are counterfeit. Now, special and severe steps have been taken, hoping that it will not be seen again in the future.</p>
<p>One Dollar Debt Repayment Far Exceeds Hong Kong</p>
<p>Also, according to an air express from a friend in the Philippines, the Philippines' response to the one dollar debt repayment movement was later than Hong Kong's, but the results achieved now far exceed those of Hong Kong. It is estimated that from January 5 to February 5, 100,000 yuan of national currency was raised. Recently, another 100,000 yuan was raised, totaling 200,000 yuan. There are only 120,000-130,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, and now 200,000 yuan has been obtained, with an average donation of more than one yuan per person. Hong Kong has more than one million compatriots, and the results are only 320,000 yuan, which is somewhat disappointing. I hope the compatriots in Hong Kong will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>Currently, there are a total of 350 rickshaws operating in Kowloon. Initially, the Police Traffic Department instructed each owner to collect a daily rental fee not exceeding 50 cents. The owners complied, but later found the management cumbersome and transferred the rickshaws to agents. The owners charged the agents 45 cents per day, but the agents, after acquiring a large number of rickshaws, increased the rent to rickshaw pullers from 60-odd cents to 84 cents per day. The pullers, burdened by the excessive cost, requested the agents to lower the rent, but were refused. Consequently, the pullers appealed to the owners, the Police Traffic Department, and the Chinese community for intervention. The Police Traffic Department has now ordered all owners to cease delegating management to agents from April 1st of this year and to manage the rickshaws themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Grain Shortage in Zhongshan <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>This newspaper's special feature on Zhongshan County states that it is a place of abundant grain, which, in addition to supplying the county itself, can also alleviate shortages in neighboring counties. Generally speaking, Zhongshan County should not experience a grain shortage. However, it is now facing a grain shortage crisis, which is a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>Following the fall of Guangzhou and the siege of Humen, Zhongshan County found itself in a precarious situation. To prepare for the impending crisis, the local government took all necessary defensive measures, including the dispersal of grain. Moreover, this occurred during the late rice harvest. The sudden shock of this unexpected event caused farmers to rush to sell their harvested grain. Rice shops and merchants naturally dared not store large quantities. In this situation of oversupply, Zhongshan's rice was extremely cheap, selling for only six dollars per hundred dan. Neighboring towns and counties came to purchase it. It was at this time that it was discovered that certain rice companies were absorbing and transporting these cheap grains to the interior. According to the regulations promulgated by the authorities to promote domestic rice to stop the loopholes, this was an unreasonable and illegal act. However, they were able to use their influence to ensure that domestic rice flowed out smoothly. "Preserving grain, avoiding × food" was a grand and clever excuse!</p>
<p>The × invaders of Guangzhou seemed to be feeling the pinch and had no strength to peer at other places. Zhongshan County gradually stabilized in this situation. After the early winter, it was spring again. The small amount of grain remaining in Zhongshan County after the major dispersal gradually dwindled, and the rice supply became short. The rice price naturally soared, from seven catties of rice for one dollar to five catties, and it is still trending upwards. The situation in neighboring towns and counties is even more dire. Ordinary middle and lower-class families are constantly complaining. In fact, many have not tasted the taste of rice for a long time, relying only on thin coarse grains to survive. The miserable situation is beyond description. If this continues, the entire Zhongshan County will be without grain in a month!</p>
<p>In response to this serious situation, the Zhongshan County Wartime Food Committee, after careful deliberation, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting exemption from import duties on foreign rice. On the other hand, it dispatched five committee members, including Li Delian and He Xijiong, to Hong Kong to appeal to the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, requesting the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce to allocate the savings from the Charity Granary and the deposits from the Relief Society to purchase foreign rice for shipment to Zhongshan, to hold down prices and maintain the people's livelihood. These committee members have now arrived in Hong Kong and have contacted the persons in charge of the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce. A meeting will be convened, approximately on Monday, to make a final decision on this matter.</p>
<p>At the same time, Gu Dinghua, the First District Administrative Commissioner, also convened the county magistrates of nine counties to discuss solutions to this problem. It was generally decided to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to exempt foreign rice from import duties and to order each township and county to find ways to manage price controls themselves. This is certainly an emergency measure. It is hoped that fellow countrymen in Hong Kong can provide strong assistance to this serious event!</p>

<h3 id="e46">Exhibition of Famous Scenery in Occupied Areas <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Qizhuo</p>
<p>Touched by the scenery of the occupied areas, aspiring to recover the homeland!</p>
<p>"The carved jade steps should still be there, but the fair faces have changed." When we stepped into the exhibition of famous scenery in the occupied areas, those precious past events suddenly rushed into the realm of memory... But we have no tears, nor sadness, only gritted teeth and clenched fists.</p>
<p>The Exhibition of Famous Scenery in Occupied Areas, organized by the Hong Kong Women's War Relief Association, is being held at St. John's Cathedral on Garden Road for three consecutive days starting yesterday. Those who flock to visit know that they are not here to appreciate works of art, but to commemorate the traces of blood and tears. Singing "Songs of Exile" in a depressed and dejected manner is the cry of the weak. Only by standing tall and fighting back home is there a way out!</p>
<p>The exhibition features 491 frames, a dazzling array, all meticulous masterpieces by Mr. Tiege. The occupied areas photographed include Beijing, the Great Wall outside the pass, Tianjin, Jinan, Mount Tai, Qufu, Nanjing, Xixia, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The ancient architecture of the old capital fully symbolizes the height and beauty of our five thousand years of national culture. Although Eastern civilization is encountering misfortune and is temporarily obscured by shadows, one day it will regain its brilliance.</p>
<p>In Tianjin, we see our simple compatriots pulling boats and working in shoes and socks. This is the most bizarre thing for southerners to see. The "layered" clothing, like paper covering the windows and cotton curtains covering the doors, everywhere reveals the northern flavor of "sesame cakes and fried dough sticks"! The flocks of sheep and camels have also temporarily changed owners!</p>
<p>Mount Tai and Qufu on the Jinpu Railway... remind people of peaches, watermelons, pears... and make them drool a little. One day, we will relive the old dreams.</p>
<p>Nanjing, our great capital, we will never forget. The "soul" of the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen has long followed the new capital to Chongqing. Today, we pay our highest tribute.</p>
<p>The famous scenery of Suzhou and Hangzhou all the more sets off the magnificence and loveliness of our mountains and rivers. Mentioning Shanghai and Guangzhou is even more the old home that the vast number of compatriots in Hong Kong constantly think of! There is no need to be sad, the facts tell us: what exactly did the × people get from us? Although the cities of points and lines have fallen, the souls of the land are protected by heroic guerrillas. Its future rebirth, brilliant future, is entrusted to the determination of the whole country to fight against the enemy and the national policy of protracted resistance. This is a necessary curve in history, giving our old country the necessary training! After visiting the exhibition, we will never waver in our self-confidence, mistaking this as the success of the × people; but rather feel the loveliness of the mountains and rivers, the greatness of the motherland. Thank you × people for revealing the face of ×××××, so that we can recover and rise up in suffering!</p>
<p>According to what Mr. He Tiehua told reporters: These films were taken by him during his travels when he was editing the Pictorial in Shanghai two or three years ago. Recently, he will personally go to the front line to photograph war zone films, so as to rush to participate in this year's exhibition held in New York in June, paying attention to the contrast between before and after the war, especially films about our heroic resistance. Let foreign countries more clearly understand × people's ××. Mr. He has a correct understanding of photography, that is, he opposes photography as a pleasure item for the idle class, and focuses on the introduction of systematic geography and folk customs. It is heard that from March 17th to 19th, an exhibition will also be held at South China Middle School, and it is planned to use the income as disaster relief for refugees.</p>
<p>It is right to use "photography" as a tool for promoting the war of resistance and building the country; at the end of the article, I would like to express my infinite hopes to Mr. He and photography enthusiasts!</p>
<h3 id="e47">Concerned About the Lives of Refugees: Hong Kong Governor Inspects Various Refugee Camps; Many Women and Children Still Live in the Open; Authorities Plan to Build Camps to Accommodate Them; New Camp to Be Built Near Ma Tau Chung to Relocate Various Chinese Troops <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Chinese war, more than ten thousand refugees from the war zones adjacent to the New Territories of the East River have fled into the territory. The Hong Kong government authorities, in addition to opening refugee camps in various districts of Kam Tin and Fanling to accommodate them as much as possible, have also built refugee houses in North Point, King's Park, and Ma Tau Chung for refugees from the original Japanese port, so that the refugees entering the territory will not live in the wilderness and become displaced. Sir Geoffrey Northcote, the Governor of Hong Kong, is very concerned about the daily lives of the refugees. Last week, he accompanied the Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Sze-to Wing-keuk, on a trip to the New Territories to inspect refugee camps and refugee areas. Every time he arrived at a refugee camp, he would summon the camp administrators to inquire in detail about the camp's equipment and provide detailed instructions.</p>
<p>Planning to Build Two New Camps</p>
<p>Accommodating Women, Children, and Chinese Troops</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the refugee camps in Hong Kong have already accommodated thousands of refugees, but there are still many women and children living on the streets, without shelter, in a very miserable state. It is reported that the government authorities, in order to settle these homeless women and children, are planning to build another refugee camp. The location of the camp is being actively sought, and the number of people to be accommodated in the future will be about three thousand. In addition, before the refugee houses in King's Park, North Point, and Ma Tau Chung were built, the authorities used the Hong Kong and Kowloon National Hospital and government agencies as temporary refugee sites. The refugees benefited greatly. In the future, after this new camp is opened, more refugees will be able to obtain shelter and will no longer suffer from living in the open. In addition, in the past, thousands of Chinese troops entered the territory. After being transported from Freedom Shipping to Ma Tau Chung refugee camp, they have been there for several months. The authorities are now planning to implement the second step of the plan in order to have more locations to uniformly settle refugees, by building a new camp near Ma Tau Chung, specifically to accommodate Chinese troops, so that the empty refugee camp houses can be opened as refugee residences, to avoid Chinese troops and refugees mixing together, and easier management. This plan will be realized in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Survey of Refugee Accommodation in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories</p>
<p>A survey of the total number of Chinese military refugees accommodated in various districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories currently reaches 10,184 people, including (King's Park Camp) a total of 1,470 people, 663 men, 505 women, and 311 children; (Ma Tau Chung) a total of 1,000 people, 561 men, 329 women, and 100 children; (North Point) a total of 1,527 people, 486 men, 711 women, and 330 children; (Kam Tin) a total of 2,750 people, 2,369 adults, and 381 children; (Cuo Hang) a total of 641 people, 535 adults, and 116 children; (Fanling North Station) a total of 835 people, 742 adults, and 93 children; (Fanling South Station) a total of 1,036 people, 913 adults, and 123 children; (San Uk Ling) a total of 916 people, 827 adults, and 89 children.</p>

<h3 id="e48">From New Opera to New National Drama <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Chunlian</p>
<p>In China, spoken drama is a transplant from foreign lands, but opera has been a national treasure since the Tang Dynasty. As the orthodox form of drama, and as the main entertainment for the masses, it has had such a long history, and its impact on the people must be enormous. Since the Republic of China, many progressive intellectuals have devoted themselves to the introduction and construction of spoken drama, but when it comes to opera, they consider it to be outdated and reactionary, not worth discussing. As a result, the revolution of opera has been delayed, the remaining feudal forces have received more support, the popularization of spoken drama has been hampered, and the establishment of a new national drama is even more distant.</p>
<p>After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, cultural salvation workers began to pay attention to this opera, which has a large audience. Thus, the transformation of the content and the training of actors began to be put into practice. The revolution of old plays and the development of the salvation drama movement were coordinated, and opera workers and spoken drama workers jointly participated in the united front of the Chinese drama world. In the course of the War of Resistance and National Construction, they will be able to build the foundation of a new national drama.</p>
<p>We want to discuss "From New Opera to New National Drama" from this point of view.</p>
<p>The opera of the Tang and Song dynasties was the infancy of Chinese drama. By the Yuan Dynasty, Chinese drama began to grow up. The original power, the thick atmosphere, the popular forms, the diverse content, and the widespread influence of the Yuan Dynasty drama are comparable to the drama of any country and any period. The drama of the Ming Dynasty was said to be more advanced than that of the Yuan Dynasty in terms of art. It was refined and classicized. The dramatic change from five acts to forty acts is a miracle in literary history. But on the other hand, it moved away from the masses and entered the court. The widespread artistic activities among the people became static literary works.</p>
<p>For this reason, chaotic tunes evolved from the legendary system, showing a trend of demanding liberation. The xipi, erhuang, and qinqiang melodies were the wild counterparts of Ming Dynasty drama. By the early years of the Republic of China, the xipi and erhuang melodies, which had been raised by the court into tame playthings, also underwent a revolution. The masses' pursuit of new things made Mei Lanfang have to perform improved Peking operas such as "A Strand of Hemp" and "An Autopsy to Verify Flowers."</p>
<p>The demand for "full plays" (i.e., stories with a beginning and an end, rather than fragments of small settings) was strengthened. Thus, in the north, there were new operas with songs and dances suitable for Mei Lanfang's performance; in the south, there were Ouyang Yuqian's creations such as "The Peach Blossom on a Human Face," "Pan Jinlian," and "Liu Sanjie," which overflowed with anti-feudal sentiments.</p>
<p>What best illustrates this demand is the growth and change of Han tunes and Cantonese tunes. Especially Cantonese tunes, with their brand new, easy-to-sing, and easy-to-listen flat-tone melodies, and stories with a beginning and an end, are what society needs, or at least can accept. But at the same time, the mixing of Chinese and Western music, the convergence of ancient and modern costumes, vulgar humor, and the abuse of mechanical sets are all low-level and unreasonable phenomena that are criticized by the world. These are all abnormal manifestations in the transition period, which proves that the new opera has not yet been established, and also indicates that the new opera must be established.</p>
<p>The development of machinery and stage technology has promoted the collapse of opera and the beginning of new experiments. The national liberation movement has deepened her political awakening and designated a new line.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese songs in old bottles, Cantonese opera performances on the streets, and Ouyang Yuqian's and Tian Han's experiments such as "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Liang Hongyu," and "New Yanmen Pass" all showed that new content was demanding new forms, and new wine would definitely burst the old bottles.</p>
<p>Now, the reform of drama is even more necessary, and only now is the reform of drama most possible. Under the call of the great era, in the demand of new reality, opera must also undergo drastic changes. We can assert that the emergence of new opera must be completed simultaneously with the great cause of resisting Japan and building the country.</p>
<p>The Sinicization of spoken drama and the modernization of opera, their intersection is the establishment of a new national drama. In this journey, we can define the content and form of opera:</p>
<p>1.  The content of the new opera must be the conscious moth's absorption of social reality from ancient and modern times, serving the resistance against Japan and the construction of the country, and cultivating the national spirit of progress, struggle, benevolence, and love. It must be a record of the struggle against aggression and oppression (in the current stage, it is anti-fascist).</p>
<p>2.  The new opera must have an organic organization, with a story with a beginning and an end, a scientific organization, and a rendering of a major form.</p>
<p>3.  The performance of the new opera will be "more human." That completely dance-like performance can only be used as a reference for a higher form.</p>
<p>4.  The stage aspect of the performance is more scientific, requiring all the conditions of modern art.</p>
<p>5.  The music must be changed from Chinese music to Western music.</p>
<p>6.  The new opera is closer to spoken drama and film. It is diversified.</p>
<p>For the spiritual food of the masses, for the victory of the War of Resistance, we must work hard to write and perform new operas, and promote the establishment of a new national drama!</p>
<h3 id="e49">On the Reform Movement of Traditional Opera, Discussing Jin Suqin <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Yuqian</p>
<p>The vigorous reform movement of traditional opera has only been acknowledged as a branch of China's dramatic activities for two years. However, due to the small number of comrades engaged in this movement, it has not yet fully unfolded. After the August 13th Incident, the cultural sphere recognized the necessity of using traditional opera for propaganda. Only then was traditional opera re-evaluated. Last year, the Theatrical Circles Salvation Association was organized in Wuhan, and branches were subsequently established in Changsha and Chongqing. Han opera, Xiang opera, Chu opera, and Sichuan troupes joined together, presenting a very vibrant scene. Although it suffered a blow due to the fall of Wuhan, this movement has not stopped in the slightest. Recently, I heard that Mr. Tian Han in Changsha has organized the actors of Xiang opera. I believe that after a considerable period, there will definitely be considerable achievements.</p>
<p>Speaking of myself, having spent twenty years in the traditional opera world and having experienced over a decade of supporting roles, I naturally have an unshirkable duty towards the reform movement of traditional opera, a desire I've harbored for a long time. However, the reform plan only gradually solidified after returning from Europe. Even after the plan was set, it only amounted to a few essays. Drama must be realized on stage to see its true value. However, in recent years, due to personal obstacles, the volatility of my own life, and the ultimate lack of objective conditions, the greatest difficulty has been finding comrades willing to put my plan on stage for experimentation. Thankfully, this War of Resistance has allowed me to meet Ms. Jin Suqin, who is a pioneer in helping me conduct this first experiment. Originally, writing plays for others to perform, or using plays I've written to perform myself, wouldn't be something worth mentioning. However, there seems to be a special circumstance: traditional operas I wrote more than a decade ago have been performed by quite a few people, but newly written plays, precisely because they contain some innovative elements, are causing some actors to hesitate. It's not because I secretly feel that the lines I've written recently have disrupted the habits and organization of traditional opera in many places, but rather that the aims and methods of the reform movement are incompatible with the commercial market. Actors only seek to make a living by going through the motions, and have no time to consider the problems of drama itself, so they muddle along. New attempts are seen as troublesome by most people. Secondly, some young actors do feel that pure traditional opera is increasingly declining, and amid hesitant contemplation, they are gradually developing reformist intentions. However, objective circumstances and personal oppression force them to only occasionally talk about it after tea and wine, unable to resolutely participate in the reform movement. Under these circumstances, Ms. Jin's enthusiasm and her resolute attitude cannot but be said to be rare.</p>
<p>She learned to sing opera from a young age, and driven by the needs of making a living, traveled throughout the northern and southern provinces, experiencing the bitterness and sweetness of life. Her theatrical skills also gradually improved through refinement. At the same time, being subjected to various stimuli and oppressions, she urgently wanted to seek liberation from a life of being a puppet and find a correct new direction for her profession—Dian opera—to establish herself. Therefore, she easily accepted the theory of reform. What is most commendable is that she has a fairly rich understanding of scripts. Thus, once she has performed a more meaningful, organized, and grammatically sound script, she is unwilling to perform nonsensical plays again. As a result, her joining a troupe to perform becomes a problem, because once she joins a troupe, she has no right to choose roles, let alone choose plays. Therefore, despite the many stages vying to invite her, she always wants to wait for the situation to improve before organizing her own troupe. Last March, she even expressed to me that from now on, she would not perform any dramas that were not related to the reform movement. I thought that was impossible. At the time, I advised her that better traditional plays could still be performed, and that performing them was also good. First, there are too few newly written plays. Second, without applying oneself, one does not yet have a sound troupe, nor a dedicated stage. It is impossible to rehearse new plays every day while joining other people's troupes. Third, being able to perform traditional operas well also leaves those who are superstitious about traditional operas with no excuse. They cannot say that they are messing around with a set of reform ideas because they cannot perform traditional operas, or because they do not perform traditional operas well. Moreover, personal life cannot be completely sacrificed. In the initial stage of any movement, it always progresses step by step. It is impossible to set a high standard and sit at home waiting to achieve the goal. Of course, there are also many people who are intent on destruction and say cold words, but we can ignore them. Currently, there are two problems that need to be solved: (1) There needs to be more plays. (2) A group of actors who have a better understanding needs to be found to form a sound group. As for the rise and fall of an individual's career at a certain period, it is not a problem, but striving to win the audience is also something that should not be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e50">"Patriotic Female Artist" <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>Since the arrival in Hong Kong of Ms. Jin Ziqin, who is hailed as a "new woman of the theatrical world, a patriotic female artist," promotional materials have been eye-catching everywhere. Newspapers have been publishing "special features" and "exclusive reports," and even special editions, which can truly be said to be the height of her popularity! Much has already been said about Ms. Jin's patriotic ideas and artistic attainments, so I will not discuss them for the time being. Judging only from the troupe's vigorous use of "patriotic female artist" and "national salvation new national opera" as promotional materials, it can be regarded as a good phenomenon in the current drama movement.</p>
<p>Now, the "national salvation new national opera" starring the "patriotic female artist" has met the people of Hong Kong. As for how the performance itself is, there will naturally be expert evaluations and audience recognition. We hope that it can live up to past publicity and meet the expectations of all parties. The Hong Kong drama community should also, from the standpoint of pure friendship, criticize or provide opinions for the sake of developing the national salvation drama movement.</p>
<p>However, one thing that cannot but be regretted is that the ticket prices set for Ms. Jin's "national salvation new national opera" this time seem to be too high, causing ordinary audience members who love drama to sigh with regret, which clearly goes against the original intention of promoting the national salvation drama movement. We hereby urge theater owners or troupe leaders and patriotic drama artists such as Ms. Jin to pay attention to this point, based on the principle of "making drama a tool for mobilizing the masses and serving the War of Resistance, national construction, and national liberation." At the same time, based on the actual situation in the drama community in the past, we feel that this phenomenon is not limited to one time or one place. Therefore, we hope even more that drama fighters who are enthusiastic about the national and social liberation movement will make greater efforts to use the power of the united front to enable patriotic drama artists and national salvation dramas to be close to the general public and prevent the "aristocratization" of patriotic drama artists and the "courtly" nature of national salvation dramas!</p>
<p>This time, Ms. Jin starred in "national salvation new national opera." According to reports, all the seats in the hall were sold out on the first day, which is enough to show the appeal of patriotic and national salvation dramas and the enthusiasm of Hong Kong compatriots for national salvation dramas. Under the encouragement of this appeal and the enthusiasm of the audience, theater owners or troupe leaders must at least recognize the sacred duty of every Chinese person in the War of Resistance, learn from the "China Art Troupe," which is currently touring for charity performances to help disaster victims, and hold a few more charity performances to donate money to the motherland and help refugees. At the same time, we hope that Ms. Jin, in order to be worthy of the honor of "patriotic female artist," will vigorously promote this move. We hereby make this small request for the sake of millions of refugees and the motherland in the flames of war!</p>
<h3 id="e51">Vanguard of the Old Opera Reform Movement: Performance by the China Drama Troupe <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The repertoire includes "Liang Hongyu," "The Peach Blossom Fan," "The Fisherman's Lament," etc.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the national War of Resistance, in order to mobilize the vast masses, traditional opera, which has always been loved by the vast masses, began to attract the attention of cultural salvation workers. Those who first started the old opera reform movement were advanced members of the Chinese theatrical world, such as Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, and Ms. Jin Ziqin, a female Peking opera singer, was the pioneer in implementing this movement. Before the fall of Greater Shanghai, under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, she organized a "China Drama Troupe" to publicly perform Ouyang's new national salvation opera "Liang Hongyu." The day of the performance coincided with the retreat of our army in Nanshi, and the situation was extremely tense. At that time, Mr. Guo Moruo wrote a poem for her: "In the past, there was Liang Hongyu, and now we see Jin Suqin; the hatred of the enemy is the same for thousands of years, and the feeling touches people's hearts in the same way." Subsequently, she continued to perform new national salvation operas such as "The Peach Blossom Fan" and "The Fisherman's Lament" in Shanghai. Later, due to the oppression of the environment, this movement could not continue. After Mr. Ouyang went south, he never forgot the continuation of this movement, but unfortunately, he could not find anyone to cooperate with. Recently, Ms. Jin, unwilling to be confined to the isolated island for a long time, came to Hong Kong specifically. Therefore, they have rejoined forces to continue the past movement of improving Peking opera and national salvation drama. Now, the China Drama Troupe officially began performing at the Lee Theatre last night. The first night's repertoire was "Liang Hongyu," written and directed by Mr. Ouyang and starring Ms. Jin. The new Peking operas of national salvation to be performed in succession will include: "The Peach Blossom Fan," "The Fisherman's Lament," "Diao Chan," etc. The performance will last for ten days, which will be a great impact on Hong Kong's old opera scene!</p>
<h3 id="e52">China Art Troupe Begins Touring Charity Performance Yesterday <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The China Art Troupe, after holding a touring charity performance in response to the One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement, sent letters to various charity organizations and schools in Hong Kong requesting cooperation. Last night, the troupe went to Qingshan at the invitation of the students of the Affiliated Middle School of Lingnan University to participate in the school's fraternity gathering, as the beginning of the China Art Troupe's touring charity performance. The repertoire performed was "Put Down Your Whip," which deeply moved about three hundred audience members. After the performance, a donation was solicited from the audience on the spot for the One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement, raising sixteen one-dollar bills, five hundred and ten ten-cent silver coins, and one hundred and forty cents, and some elementary school students donated five food coupons worth four cents each, totaling sixty-eight Hong Kong dollars and sixty cents, which were announced by the student union representative after being counted, and the funds were directly transferred to the Bank of China. Although the amount donated in this touring charity performance was not large, with the spirit of the China Art Troupe and the cooperation of various organizations and schools, there will definitely be more satisfactory results in the future. The troupe's second public performance is scheduled for the 28th, 29th, and 30th of this month, and the venue is still the Central Theatre. At the same time, after the second public performance, they will hold a charity performance to raise funds to help refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, probably in mid-April.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Stage Technique Talks <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Dun</p>
<p>IV. Rehearsal Work</p>
<p>After all the preparatory work has been done, rehearsals can begin. Rehearsal is the most practical work, the creative process of a performance.</p>
<p>Once a decision has been made to begin rehearsals, the director calls together all the actors and related staff, such as prompters and sound effects personnel, to prepare to begin rehearsing. For rehearsals, four or five weeks are appropriate for a long play, and two weeks for a short play. Anything shorter is too rushed, but the time should not be extended too long, especially under our current circumstances, where there is really no allowance for sufficient time, and actors' interest may disappear if it's too long.</p>
<p>Before officially starting rehearsals, there is a round-table reading of the script. This is the method of the Moscow Art Theatre. The time spent on this reading is not wasted, because all aspects of performance technique, especially the actors' technique, are largely researched and decided at this time.</p>
<p>During the round-table reading, the director can publicly present the research on the script and their own attitude towards the script, the techniques to be used in the performance, and the requirements for the actors. At the same time, the personality, habitual language, tone, and habitual movements, emotional use, and grasp of the climax of each character can be discussed and decided.</p>
<p>On the actor's side, they can also use this time to become familiar with the script, correct awkward phrases, and discuss and research with their partners to achieve complete cooperation with each other.</p>
<p>The most ideal rehearsal should take place on the stage every time, but this is not possible in the current situation. However, the rehearsal place should ideally be the same size as the stage on which it will be performed, especially for those actors without stage experience, because if the rehearsal place is too small, they will feel vast and boundless when they step onto the big stage. A round table that can be reached in two steps during rehearsal may require ten steps on stage. When such a situation is encountered, actors with rich stage experience are fine, but for new actors with little experience, they often make mistakes in the predetermined positions during rehearsal. When the position is wrong, the cooperation with the other party also goes wrong, and then they become flustered and helpless. How can they perform a good play?</p>
<p>During rehearsals, various large props can be replaced by other things when absolutely necessary. The small props have a very close relationship. For example, an actor should pick up a cigarette while saying a certain line, light it when they get to the last line, and throw away the match when the other person starts speaking... because this simple little action may be a good effect, but the acquisition of this effect requires the movement time to match, so this must be practiced during rehearsal. If these smoking devices are ignored during rehearsal, it will not be easy to match the appropriate time when the performance is on, and the effect will be lost. The performance of drama is the art of rhythmic time, just like a piece of music, with beats and rhythms, and this progression tune is determined during rehearsal.</p>
<p>The play is of course rehearsed one act at a time, but each act can also be rehearsed in sections. The division of sections is generally based on the entrance and exit of the characters. Furthermore, each section is divided into smaller segments based on the changes in emotion. First rehearse the small segments, then rehearse the sections, then the acts, and finally the entire play.</p>
<p>During the initial rehearsal, the director should not demand too much of the actors, and it is enough to get the large positions familiar, but the most important thing is to explain to the actors why they should run from here to there, because this is the only way to be natural and not stiff. Because between each slightly larger action and another action, there must be a small action to continue without losing naturalness. If the actor understands the meaning from one action to another, the actor themselves will naturally do the subtle parts.</p>
<p>Once the large positions are familiar, the detailed rehearsal begins, which is the time to concentrate. At this time, all the predetermined effects must be made. The director can also ask the actors for everything they want. Small actions must come out, mutual breathing must be paid attention to, emotions must be grasped, and work must be done seriously. The success or failure of the future performance depends entirely on this.</p>
<p>The period of paper rehearsal is the most strenuous time for the director. He is like the conductor of an orchestra, manipulating the entire orchestra and the performance of each musician. At this time, the director will not sit comfortably in a corner. He may walk up and down, or he may crouch next to the actors, but he is not prompting, but manipulating the soul of the actor, prompting the plot of each scene, the appropriateness of emotions, and the expression of time, which is the most important move in the performance!</p>
<p>After a considerable period of detailed rehearsals, the director considers it to be mature enough and can hold a trial performance. If it is not possible to have a trial performance on the stage, there must be a serious trial performance with all the large and small props and sound effects ready, just like the performance. At this time, the director can sit comfortably in the audience and enjoy it. However, he still has work to do and must record anything that is not suitable in the play during the trial performance and make corrections later.</p>
<p>When the real performance comes, the director can watch the play leisurely, because he has no more burdens and his work has been completed.</p>

<h3 id="e58">South China Controls the Game, Eliminates Eastern 6-1, Eastern's Decisive Defeat Shows Inferior Skill, This Victory Makes the Silver Shield Seem Assured for South China <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report] It is a fact that the technical skills of the Eastern Athletic Association's entire First Division football team have recently improved compared to the past. They even had the opportunity to rest and take advantage in the league, causing a minor setback for South China, which is also a fact. Therefore, some people overestimated Eastern's fighting power, thinking that their level was now comparable to South China and could form a balanced force. So, before yesterday's special Silver Shield semi-final began, when discussing the outcome, opinions were divided, but more people believed that Eastern was confident of victory.</p>
<p>The truth is still the truth. The evidence of Eastern's inferiority to South China was revealed in yesterday's match. That evidence is the huge score of 6-1. Although this vastly different result cannot determine that Eastern is weak, it is undeniable that it is South China's greatness. Afterwards, some people said, "Yesterday's weather was a mix of rain and sunshine, and the field was wet, which greatly affected Eastern's players. Their performance was not as good as it could have been, leading to defeat. If the weather had been clear and the ground dry, Eastern's forwards could have launched a surprise attack and seriously threatened South China. If they could have scored more than one goal back, they might not have lost so badly." Speaking of the rain problem, it not only affected Eastern but also South China. However, South China's ability is not controlled by the environment but can control the environment. This is their true skill in difficult situations.</p>
<p>The reason for South China's big win is that they were able to control the situation and take the initiative. The advantage of this control is that each player has a good command of the ball, and they respond to each other with coordinated advances and retreats. Although the field was slippery, they still maintained their connection and passing, which was appropriate in every aspect. They put on a game that clearly won with skill. On the other hand, although Eastern's players were all brave in their efforts, their command of the ball was not as skillful as South China's. As a result, their connection was scattered, and even the only advantage of the front line, the surprise attack, did not succeed even once throughout the whole game. Only Xu Jingcheng managed to restrain South China's defense to some extent.</p>
<p>In this game, South China's Liu Qingcai was absent. Although Guo Yingqi, who replaced him in the front line, performed very well, even the fierce Xu Jingcheng was sometimes contained by him. The cunning Hou Chengtuo was even more unable to succeed under double surveillance. Chen Bingtu sometimes had gaps to exploit, but his passing was often untimely, making his efforts futile. Li Deqi also couldn't penetrate, so he had very few opportunities. Occasionally, he had brilliant shots, but they were saved by Zhang Rongcai's excellent goalkeeping. Rongcai's high skill was also fully demonstrated in this game.</p>
<p>In the past, many people thought that Eastern's forward line was better than South China's. However, yesterday's battle gave us an answer. Although South China was missing Shen Yucai due to a foot injury, Liang Rongzhao's versatile performance, covering both front and back, and Li Guowei and Yingzu's coordinated response from left and right, created a perfect combination, performing interception, attack, and passing skills, all of which were excellent. Compared with Eastern's forwards, they were indeed overshadowed.</p>
<p>When the clock struck four, South China's Liu Qingcai had not arrived, which made the coach very anxious. Because the battle drum was urging frequently, he was forced to send ten players into the field. After four minutes, he quickly supplemented with Li En'en, and switched Guo Qi back to right forward, forming the following lineup:</p>
<p>(South China Lineup)</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi</p>
<p>Luo Douwen, Li Zhaorong, Feng Jingxiang, Li Enliang, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>(Eastern Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Miao Guohua, Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan, Song Lingsheng, Liu Shidu</p>
<p>Hou Chengtuo, Xu Jingcheng, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>18 minutes, South China attacked. Eastern's center backs rushed to the rescue. Zhaorong got the ball and went straight to the goal like a horse off its leash. Shorty Liu Shidu saw that the capital was about to fall and rode to the rescue, tripping Zhaorong. The referee immediately awarded a penalty. Jingxiang took the penalty kick and scored with one shot (1-0).</p>
<p>23 minutes, the short and nimble Yingqi sent a long pass from the right. Jingxiang pretended to intercept the ball but suddenly let it pass to Zhaorong. Zhaorong, about ten yards from the goal, used his "slingshot" kick and sent the ball into the net (2-0).</p>
<p>27 minutes, Qi didn't know what kind of stimulant he had taken, darting left and right and gaining possession. He cleverly passed it to Li Enliang. Enliang saw Jingxiang active in Eastern's territory and immediately passed it to him. Jingxiang raised his foot to shoot, hitting Xianhan's body directly and rebounding out. Jingxiang shot again, and Xianhan was unable to save it (3-0).</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>5 minutes, Jingxiang controlled the ball skillfully, dodging left and right, creating a path forward, and cleverly passing it to Zhaorong. Zhongyun turned around to chase, but it was too late. Zhaorong scored a single-handedly (4-0).</p>
<p>12 minutes, Jingcheng made a detour, gritting his teeth, and passed through many obstacles. He shot when he had the chance, but Rongcai dove to the ground and pushed it out of bounds, only conceding a corner kick.</p>
<p>25 minutes, Eastern worked hard to strengthen their attack and broke into South China's territory. Zhaorong returned to defend and battled with Bingtu. Bingtu managed to steal the ball and cross it. Qixiang intercepted the ball and passed it to Jingcheng. Jingcheng shot with his left foot, and Rongcai was unable to save it. Eastern broke the shutout (4-1).</p>
<p>36 minutes, the skilled Jingxiang was still in control. Seeing Zhaorong standing in a good position, he sent a perfect pass. Zhaorong lived up to his mission and scored again in an undefended location (5-1).</p>
<p>41 minutes, Guangsen took a corner kick. After South China's forwards poured into the goal area and kicked it out, Zhaorong headed the ball into the net in the crowd (6-1).</p>
<p>43 minutes, Eastern launched a fierce counterattack. The vanguard besieged South China, and shots rained down, dazzling the eye. Qixiang shot a ball in a hurry, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Tiansheng cleared it with one kick. The game ended, and Eastern was eliminated 6-1.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Kwong Wah Easily Defeats Hong Kong Football Club, A Comfortable 3-1 Victory <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The league match between Kwong Wah and the Hong Kong Football Club was played at the Caroline Hill pitch yesterday afternoon at 4:31 pm. As a result of the fierce battle, Kwong Wah won 3-1 due to the skillful use of their soldiers and coordinated connections, defeating the Hong Kong Football Club. At the beginning of yesterday's match, Hong Kong FC was still able to parry and occasionally look for opportunities to counterattack. However, in the second half, they showed their weakness and were heavily besieged by Kwong Wah. If Kwong Wah's forwards had made more short passes and shot when they saw an opportunity, the winning goals would have been more than that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Kwong Wah's front and rear lines fought exceptionally hard, and their performance was particularly wonderful. The forward line has shown progress technically compared to the past. The attacking power of the Hong Kong Football Club mainly relied on the center forward and the two inside forwards. The two inside backs were the weakest, so they were often the main areas of attack for Kwong Wah. Overall, the best players for both teams were Zou Wenzhi, Che Shijin, Hou Rongsheng, and Li Guoqi for Kwong Wah, followed by Huang Jicong and Qian Chifen. For Hong Kong FC, they were Jia Ya, Wei Luson, Pa Lu, and Yi Shi She Lan Zhi.</p>
<p>When the battle began, Kwong Wah's front immediately attacked the key areas of Hong Kong FC, charging left and right like an avalanche. Soon, Shijin advanced into the territory, knocking on the door. The ball was as fast as an arrow, and Gao Lushi jumped to save it, but it was too late. Unfortunately, the ball was slightly high and only grazed the crossbar. Later, the two Zou and Huang followed closely to defend, but they were ambushed in front of the goal and forced to retreat. After a long battle, Chifen once again kicked the ball forward. Yi Shi She Lanzhi came out to block, but the ball was intercepted by Wenqia. Zou dodged left and right, aimed at the target, and shot with his foot, sending the ball into the net. After Hong Kong FC took the lead, they launched a full counterattack. Wei Lu and others explored the goal successively, but due to the lack of skill in their footwork, they ultimately achieved nothing.</p>
<p>Twenty-five minutes into the game, Bingjin rushed along the side and passed the ball diagonally to the left. Jingting intercepted it and shot fiercely, going as fast as lightning, accurately and powerfully. However, it hit Gao Lushi's body directly and was blocked out. Before long, the first half ended, with Kwong Wah leading 1-0.</p>
<p>In the second half, Hong Kong FC's Pa Lu counterattacked from the side. Hua Ji came out to block him, only conceding a corner kick, thus escaping a major danger. At this time, Hong Kong FC continued to attack, but Kwong Wah's defense was tight, making it impossible to cross the line. Soon, Bingjin dribbled the ball straight up the side, and Shijin responded in front of the goal and shot it into the net. Then, Wenzhi scored another goal, adding icing to the cake. At this point, Hong Kong FC, unwilling to be shut out, launched a large-scale attack. Finally, Jia Ya returned a goal to Kwong Wah, ending the game 3-1. The lineups of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>(Kwong Wah)</p>
<p>Li Guoqi</p>
<p>Zhong Huilin, Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Huang Huaji, Yang Zixiang, Zhang Shuhui</p>
<p>Huang Jingting, Deng Wenzhi, Qian Chifen, Zhuo Shijin, Liang Bingjin</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Football Club)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Only One First Division Football Match Today, Eastern vs. St. Joseph's <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Today, there will be one match each in the First, Second, and Third Division football leagues. According to the original schedule, the First Division had Eastern vs. St. Joseph's and He Ge vs. South China. However, the He Ge vs. South China match has been postponed, so there is only the Eastern vs. St. Joseph's match. In the first week of the competition, Eastern defeated St. Joseph's 4-3. However, St. Joseph's forward Wu Derong punched Xie Jinhong in the match against South China on the 4th of this month. The Football Association ruled to suspend him the day before yesterday. Da Gao Shan Nu Bi Lu Du and others are also said to be tired. It is expected that their lineup will not be complete. From this point of view, Eastern should be able to win. However, Eastern's players played in the Silver Shield match yesterday, and they are all tired. They will play again today, and it is not known whether they can support it. Therefore, this is a bit worrying. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>First Division 4:30 PM</p>
<p>Eastern Athletic Association vs. St. Joseph's Hong Kong Football Club Pitch</p>
<p>Second Division 3:00 PM</p>

<p>[Special Report] After the women's basketball tournament ended, the basketball court had been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, it became lively again because the women's awards ceremony was held last night, and it was also the beginning of the men's basketball tournament.</p>
<p>According to the schedule, the first game was the awards ceremony, with this year's women's champion team, Mei Fang, playing against the Hong Kong United team.</p>
<p>Mei Fang's Meilian was not on the field, which was a pity. However, looking at Hong Kong United, it was only composed of players from Xuehua, South China, Southwest China, and Overseas Chinese teams. Their strength was not very strong.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, Hong Kong United scored first, taking the lead. After a while, Zan Zhen returned a basket, and the score caught up later. In this quarter, Hong Kong United lost 6-4.</p>
<p>Both sides made progress in the second quarter, and they even tied at 8-8 at one point. Although Shouguang's performance last night was wonderful, his shooting was slightly inaccurate. As a result, they still lagged behind 8-12 in this quarter.</p>
<p>The second half was even more of Mei Fang's world. Although Hong Kong United tried hard, their connection was scattered, and they fought independently. The whole game was lost 18-10 to the champion team.</p>

<p>As for the awards ceremony, it was held after the first quarter. Chen Huiqing presented the awards, and the ceremony was very simple. After the awards ceremony, the men's basketball game began, with the Eastern team playing against the University of Hong Kong team.</p>
<p>For Eastern, Nianhua, Xv Heng, Dingfen, and Jian performed very well. For the University of Hong Kong, although Xuhua worked hard, one tree could not support a collapsing building. As a result, it was only in vain.</p>
<p>After the start, it was a tense game between you and me. However, after about ten minutes, the people of Hong Kong showed that they could not hold on. Eastern's iron cavalry frequently stepped all over the territory. During this time, Dingfen and Nianhua worked very hard, so that the University of Hong Kong could only defend and could not fight back. Brother Heng was also good, and he often won a lot of applause from the audience. At halftime, Eastern led 36-14. In the second half, Eastern's performance was even better. Dingfen and Nianhua were like butterflies dancing among flowers, and their shooting accuracy was like picking things out of a bag. The score gradually increased. At this time, the University of Hong Kong players were already exhausted and panting like cows. The final result was 73-25, Eastern won.</p>

<p>At 9 pm last night, the Youth Association Sports Department of the Basketball Association convened a special committee meeting. The matters discussed were: (1) Regarding the Journalists' Sports Association's letter requesting a re-appeal, it was resolved that it would be handled by the Senior Referees Committee and that an additional appeal fee of ten yuan must be paid. (2) South China came to the meeting requesting that the team's Wu player had participated in Group A last year, and this year he joined Group B. The Association was requested to make a special exception. It was resolved that this procedure was in conflict with the Association's constitution and could not be approved.</p>

<p>(65) Come to Hollywood with your mother for a two-week vacation, visit friends, one of whom works for a film company. This is the kind of help Nan Grey needed.</p>
<p>(66) Stand out in smaller theaters near Hollywood—like Robert Young and Katharine Hepburn did.</p>
<p>(67) Become famous on the radio. If your face matches your voice, you'll be as lucky as Bing Crosby, Don Ameche, Jack Benny, and Joe Penner.</p>
<p>(68) Study singing for years, then perform a concert in Los Angeles. A year later, you might get a screen role. Nelson Eddy did it this way.</p>
<p>(69) Be a wealthy lawyer—often acting in amateur theater—run out of money—and then get on the screen with the help of friends. This is how Samuel S. Hinds first became a character actor.</p>
<p>(70) Be taken in and raised by a director, like Katherine DeMille.</p>
<p>(71) Be the daughter of a cameraman, like Joan Marsh.</p>
<p>(72) If a magazine novel is being made into a movie, and you look exactly like the hero in the novel's illustrations, try your luck. This is why Cornel Wilde played Kid Galahad.</p>
<p>(73) Solicit newspaper ads in the film company's office. John Patterson got his chance on screen this way.</p>
<p>(74) Work as a waiter in a big Hollywood hotel, unexpectedly burst into song along with the music. Douglas Fowley tried his luck this way.</p>
<p>(75) Be a dance instructor. If one of your students gets a screen test, go to the film company with her as her guardian. Grace Ford entered the film industry this way.</p>
<p>(76) If your friend is being tested, and you're asked to read the script for him/her, read it well. You might succeed, like Virginia Field (her friend failed).</p>
<p>(77) Marry a female star, and perhaps she can get you a screen test. Leonard Penn relied on his wife, Gladys George, for help.</p>
<p>(78) If you have eight years of performance experience before the age of twelve, boldly ask for a job at a film company like Judy Garland did. You probably won't be rejected.</p>
<p>(79) Close your eyes and pick a director's name from the phone book, go see him and ask for his help. This is Kenneth Howell's method.</p>
<p>(80) Live next door to a director, have him pat you on the head, and introduce you to the film industry, like how a director introduced David Holt.</p>
<p>(81) Come to Hollywood as a writer and director, follow the production team to Monogram Pictures, and when a comedian happens to get sick, you can replace him. Hugh Herbert immediately became a famous comedian.</p>
<p>(82) Bring a letter of introduction to a director in Hollywood, like Jack Oakie did. Nothing else is necessary.</p>
<p>(83) Interview stars for a British magazine, and have the magazine publish a photo of you together. Buck Jones chose Dorothy Hope as his leading lady after seeing a photo of her with himself.</p>
<p>(84) "Capture alive" some wild animals, like Frank Buck (though he got scratched by his captives once).</p>
<p>(85) If you're accurate with your shots, able to shatter the glass in an actor's hand off-camera, you'll be noticed, like Sammy McKim.</p>
<p>(86) Win an essay contest and be sent to Russia, have your parents object, drawing attention from the newspapers. Frances Farmer got a screen test because of this.</p>
<p>(87) Perform makeup demonstrations for a cosmetics store related to a film company. They won't ignore you, at least they didn't ignore Marla Shelton.</p>
<p>(88) Write some film shorts for yourself. Robert Benchley succeeded in this area.</p>
<p>(89) Be a dressing room attendant for a film star for six years, then join a black amateur performance group. This is Louise Beaver's past.</p>
<p>(90) Practice kissing skills diligently. Frank Shields became the star of "Come and Take It" because he won a kissing contest.</p>
<p>(91) Be able to joke around with the Marx Brothers. Margaret Dumont could, so the film industry used her.</p>
<p>(92) If you come to Hollywood on vacation and wholeheartedly dedicate yourself to your career, and someone tells you that you're perfect to play a gangster on screen, ignore them. Didn't George Raft ignore them? Yet he is now a big star.</p>
<p>(93) Be able to sneeze in a way that no one else can. Bill Gilbert's stardom relies entirely on his nose—and a very annoying one at that.</p>
<p>(94) Often play supporting roles for a famous actor, so he feels he can't go to Hollywood without you, like Smiley Burnette for Gene Autry.</p>
<p>(95) Undress carelessly in public places, so Gypsy Rose Lee became Louise Hovick on screen.</p>
<p>(96) Sell magazines in front of the studio gate. Irena Benett didn't get noticed after winning a bodybuilding competition, but she was discovered by the film industry because of this.</p>
<p>(97) Come to Hollywood, speak with a Viennese accent, dress in Parisian styles, and have the American press exaggerate your image, making Americans think you're a real countess. Sari Maritza succeeded with this method.</p>
<p>(98) Imitate the actions of stars in Hollywood revues, like Kim Hye-soo. Someone will eventually notice your cleverness and wit.</p>
<p>(99) Write a letter to the film company's casting department, briefly and without exaggeration stating your special characteristics. Veda Ann Borg unexpectedly received a reply.</p>
<p>(100) Actors who are already famous elsewhere—preferably abroad—are the easiest to recruit, such as Danielle Darrieux, Annabella, Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Luise Rainer.</p>
<p>(101) Learn basic acting skills at home, in small theaters, or in amateur classes—wherever you can find them—then go to the New York stage for further training. This is not the quickest shortcut, but it is the most reliable method. In fact, it is the only reliable method. There are too many examples of success with this method to list, but let's pick a few of the most famous ones: Paul Muni, Spencer Tracy, Margaret Sullavan, Claudette Colbert, James Stewart, and Basil Rathbone.

<h3 id="e68">"Peace," "Struggle," "Save China!" <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>"...In a quiet sickroom, a dying patient lay on the bed, his face gradually fading, his eyes gradually drying up, a faint breath intermittently escaping from his lips, barely audible whether it was a groan or a cry, 'Peace,' 'Struggle,' 'Save China,' one after another, about forty times at least, gradually even his breath could not escape, all that could be seen was the slight movement of his lips..."</p>
<p>What a touching description—Wang Jingwei, then still a follower of Sun Yat-sen, so touchingly recorded Sun Yat-sen's dying moments and his dying cry—representing his lifelong fighting spirit, and marking the demands of the entire Chinese nation: "Peace," "Struggle," "Save China"!</p>
<p>Although Sun Yat-sen did not personally witness the unprecedented disaster of the "September 18th Incident," he had a premonition. He had long pointed out, "Strong neighbors surround us, eyeing us with predatory intent... nibbling and devouring, already effective in rapid succession, partitioning and dismembering, truly worrying in the present situation." He also affirmed the inevitability of Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, although he did not personally lead the entire nation into the "July" liberation struggle, he had already pointed out, "A unified China can resist Japanese oppression." He left behind the doctrine of national salvation—the Three Principles of the People; he left behind the political agenda of national salvation—alliance with Russia, accommodation of the Communists, and the three major policies supporting workers and peasants; he left behind the three slogans of "Peace," "Struggle," and "Save China" in his last breath. Sun Yat-sen had lit the streetlights, and the ranks of the national war were filled with enthusiasm, courage, and a desire for light, embarking on the road of July!</p>
<p>Struggle for peace, struggle for lasting world peace, struggle to eliminate war forever through war, struggle for humanity! The most realistic goal is "Save China," the most glorious task is "For humanity." We not only ourselves, the entire nation, participate in the war, resolutely fighting, we also declare to the world: Fight—for your glory and ours—for your welfare and ours—who is more shameful than worms crying for peace, a humiliating peace? Who is more shameful than distorting Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary slogan, revolutionary doctrine, demonizing the three sacred, fiery, and beautiful cries of "Peace," "Struggle," and "Save China," shamelessly saying: Peace can save China, then we want peace; struggle can save China, then we struggle, using the slogan of war as a banner of surrender, using the sacred promise as a mask of rebellion, abandoning ourselves to humanity? Yes! Sun Yat-sen shouted for peace, this is a prophecy of a world of great harmony, a peace under justice; Sun Yat-sen called for struggle, is "first uniting ourselves, extending it to others, then uniting all small and weak nations, to jointly break the 250 million, jointly using justice to break power" struggle: undoubtedly, the purpose is "Save China," to bring China from a state of temporary security and danger to the road of freedom and liberation—destroying the true meaning of Sun Yat-sen's peace and struggle, painting peace with the color of slavery, distorting the task of saving China into a humiliating act of stealing half the country for temporary peace only to end in destruction, this is Sun Yat-sen's traitor! A thief of progressive humanity!</p>
<p>Fourteen years have passed, we revisit Sun Yat-sen's cry at his death, we feel sorrow, and we also feel excitement! Today is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death! For peace, for the freedom and liberation of our ancestors, we should stand in each person's position and fight!</p>
<h3 id="e69">Distant Friendship <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Yingwei</p>
<p>What I cannot forget most in my memory is: a piece of distant friendship bravely fighting the enemy in the flames of war in the North, it is the comfort of my soul, it is the trust of my sincere heart. He is my only best friend!</p>
<p>Since we waved goodbye in the scorching sun of Jiangnan, we have gone our separate ways north and south. It has been three or four years since I returned to the South. In this long separation, our hearts have been longing for each other like exiles. Because our messages are often conveyed on the necks of pigeons.</p>
<p>However, a magical wind rose on the plain, the enemy ignited the line of provocation at Lugou Bridge, and extended their demonic hands to Shanghai to ignite the raging fire of the anti-Japanese war. In order to defend the country and defend the territory, every young man with a sense of responsibility stood on the guard post waiting to fight the enemy.</p>
<p>In the anti-Japanese war full of artillery fire, my heart was as anxious as a bomb for my distant friend—bombing! bombing! retreat! retreat! Retreating to the second line of defense, my friend's home finally fell under the bombing of the X-men. The family of mothers and children wandering on the banks of the river made me hate the brutality of the X-men even more.</p>
<p>When my friend left his mother and pregnant wife to go to the front line to fight the X-men, I received this short letter from him:</p>
<p>"My good friend: I am now a homeless person, and my brothers and sisters are scattered. My wife's sister was bombed to death, and everything is over for me. Now I only have one way, and that is to fight the X-men! Your best friend, Zhen Huang."</p>
<p>The news from the front became more and more tense every day, and my longing for my friend became more and more tense. He will meet the X-men one day, I thought so. But he hasn't given me any news for a long time. How much I miss him!</p>
<p>Our resistance war is unyielding and lasting, and our friendship will not be broken by artillery fire and continues. In the greatest Battle of Wuhan in the Anti-Japanese War, my friend also did his part in the defense work, but after the fall of Wuhan, our news was cut off again.</p>
<p>In despair, I finally received a worn-out letter sent from the front line, how happy I was:</p>
<p>"My good friend: For the past half month, we have been marching from Songbu to Linshanhe, Xinzhou, Shangbahe, Xishui, then from Xishi to Linshanhe, and then from Linshanhe to Tuanfeng, down the Yangtze River, through Shihuiyao, to Ludaoye, Baishapu to Yangxin, not staying in one place for more than three days, so we did very little work for the people. This time from Xinzhou to Ruichang, three nights of marching, the comrades all felt quite tired, so we rested here for one day, and the next day we could start arranging work. Not many people fled Ruichang, but the wartime mobilization work was not done well enough. All people's organizations are mostly forcibly gathered together, because the leadership at the upper level is ineffective. The general public doesn't know what they should do in this critical moment? How to do it well? Each group only has a superficial formation and no actual work performance. So after we came here, we wanted to quickly launch a movement to protect our homes and resist the enemy. There are also many intellectual youths in Ruichang, but their work attitude is mostly incorrect. There is a tendency to be showy, so we also need to correct their mistakes from our actions. We hope to stay here longer. In that case, the foundation of our work may be firmly established. It is less than fifty or sixty miles from here to Jiujiang, and the sound of cannons can already be faintly heard. Yesterday, enemy planes came to visit twice. They dropped a few bombs, but fortunately they didn't hurt many people. Originally, we could have lived in the suburbs like the various agencies of the General Headquarters, but for the convenience of work, we still live in the city. We live in a large flower group, and we feel comfortable with everything. This is the first time we have enjoyed such comfort since the Anti-Japanese War!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When I was in Ruichang, I didn't finish writing the letter to you and suddenly received an order to leave. Now we are stationed in a small village less than thirty miles from Jiujiang. We are working every day under the bombing of enemy planes and the sound of cannons. Yesterday and today, Jiujiang has fallen into a state of mixed war, which is certainly very tense, so we dare not have a moment or a trace of slack in our work. This is an important gateway on the east-west Yangtze River in Wuhan, and we must hold on to it. The enemy is also determined to occupy it. Enemy planes are bombing every day, and all the cemeteries in nearby villages and towns have been destroyed. Tens of thousands of farmers were sacrificed. We are watching this scene of bloody chaos. Everyone has deepened their hatred of the enemy...!"</p>
<p>It is really difficult to find an opportunity to send letters by mail in the military. Today, because the comrades are going to the rear, I quickly wrote this letter in a hasty manner. Please don't laugh at me. Because of the time, I will talk about the rest next time!"</p>
<p>After reading this letter, I was deeply moved. I cannot work on the front line like my friend, and I feel ashamed and sad in my heart, but it is also comforting to have a good friend on the battlefield! Selfish thoughts made me feel the loneliness and lack of tension in the rear, and I was condemned.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think of calling my good friend back to the rear to rest for a while, but I often want to go to the front to accompany my comrades. But fate does not allow us to reunite in this distant friendship. I can only be abandoned in the rear forever and accept the good news reported by my comrades on the front line.</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I received news from the front.</p>
<p>—Good friend: We have been living in Qujiang, Guangdong for more than half a month. We have launched a large-scale mass movement here—but, I haven't received your letter for a long time. In my work, how worried I am about you!</p>
<p>Distant friendship! How memorable it will always be!</p>
<h3 id="e70">Two Puppet Emperors of the Song Dynasty <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>——Notes on Reading History</p>
<p>The Jin people invaded the Song Dynasty and twice set up puppet governments, practicing the strategy of using Chinese to control Chinese. The first time was in the second year of Jingkang. The Jin army attacked Bianjing and took the Huizong and Qinzong emperors away, and then established the Song official Zhang Bangchang as the Emperor of Chu. But later, the Jin army returned north, and Zhang Bangchang abdicated, only serving as emperor for a short-lived thirty-six days. The second time a puppet government was established was in the third year of Jianyan, when the Jin people established Liu Yu as the Emperor of Qi. Liu Yu lived the emperor's life for eight years before being deposed by the Jin people.</p>
<p>Although Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu were both traitors cursed by the world, there was still a difference in the degree of their betrayal. Zhang Bangchang was forced to become a puppet by the Jin people, not out of his own volition. So after he came to power as a puppet, he was still somewhat scrupulous and dared not act recklessly. When he summoned the officials, he referred to himself as "Yu" (I), not daring to call himself "Zhen" (I, emperor). When he appointed officials, he also added the character "Quan" (temporary), indicating that this was of a temporary nature. He sent people to welcome Song Kangwang, and himself pleaded: "The reason why I reluctantly followed the Jin people's establishment was to temporarily act expediently in order to alleviate the national crisis, and I dare not have any other intentions." It can be seen that Zhang Bangchang was not yet a traitor, and can only be said to be a confused puppet at best!</p>
<p>But Liu Yu was a thorough and complete traitor! Liu Yu's becoming a puppet was not the result of being pushed out by the Chu people, but the result of seeking and demanding it himself. He spent a lot of money and treasures to bribe the enemy, Talan. He acted as a fake emperor for eight years, not only without any sense of shame or scruples, but willingly acted as the enemy's dog, leading troops to invade the motherland several times. He can be said to have been extremely insane!</p>
<p>Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu, these two treasonous fellows, did not have good endings in the end. Although Zhang Bangchang later returned to the Song Dynasty, rebellious and traitorous ministers are not tolerated by national law, and he was eventually赐死 (forced to commit suicide) by Song Gaozong. Liu Yu had the backing of the Jin Kingdom's powerful Talan and Nianhan, and was able to come to power; but later Talan and Niantu lost power. Once his backing collapsed, the traitor lost his support, and was finally deposed by his master (the Jin people). The Jin people imprisoned him in Jinming Pond, and the fake emperor became a prisoner. In the end, he died in the enemy country. The endings of these two puppet emperors were equally tragic, and can serve as a warning to current traitors!</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Wonderful Use of Astrologers <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Japanese warlords have always used a kind of anesthetic method to encourage the people's ambition to invade. Therefore, things like "amulets" and "thousand-person stitches" are their supreme magic weapons for setting up Shintoism and fooling their people. The baseness and stupidity of this method are equivalent to the Empress Dowager Cixi's use of the "Boxer Rebellion," believing that guns and cannons cannot enter, and knives and fire cannot harm, which is equally ridiculous.</p>
<p>Recently, they have come up with a new idea and invented a new method of deceiving the public. According to Reuters yesterday, "Thirty astrologers in Tokyo have organized an association after being lectured by the police chief, and have decided that during this emergency period of war against China, they will encourage optimism among those who come to ask about the future." This base, vulgar and mediocre method is not only ridiculous, but also pathetic. With such a large Tokyo, only thirty astrologers are probably not enough to distribute, and if superstitious people come to ask about the future, the astrologers will just lie and say whatever they want. Assuming that the people of Tokyo do not come to ask about the future, then the astrologers will have no place to use their heroism, and cannot lie, so what to do? Here, I can also offer a supplementary method.</p>
<p>As long as the police chief issues an order: (1) All people living in Tokyo must go to an astrologer to ask about their future fortune, and those who do not go to an astrologer to ask about their future fortune will be considered to have reactionary ideas. (2) All people living in Tokyo, regardless of gender, age, or size, must carry a "fate chart" with them, just like the people in our country's guerrilla areas must have a "pass," "smallpox vaccination certificate," and "epidemic prevention certificate." If the people are inspected and they or their homes have no "fate chart," they can be accused of treason. In this way, the Japanese people's war-supporting ideology will have no way to develop, and can be fundamentally eradicated. Isn't this a wonderful method?</p>
<p>But the principle of astrologers is to "ask about disasters, not about blessings." Assuming that the Tokyo astrologers, according to the principles of astrologers, like "Zhang Tie Mouth" and "Li Tie Mouth," are equally honest, and present the truth, without any concealment, I am afraid that all the people of Tokyo will be shaken, and the gunpowder depots all over Japan will be as dangerous as the Osaka arsenal. Even if the astrologers can obey orders and follow instructions, but since the beginning of the war, for twenty months, prices have been rising day by day, the economy has been shrinking day by day, the population has been decreasing day by day, the number of widows has been increasing day by day, and the "honored" cemeteries of the fallen soldiers are everywhere, and the ashes of the warriors are continuously transported back from the warships. Under these circumstances, I think that these astrologers, no matter how eloquent they are, no matter how flowery their words are, the people of Tokyo will still not be able to believe them? Therefore, this kind of method only shows their hard work and clumsiness. Here, I see the Japanese warlords' boredom and messiness.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Manchurian Snow <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>The streetlights were lit. The once bright light, in the hazy space, was no longer as bright as before.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that he came from a desolate street and walked into a basement bar. He stood in front of the long counter, crumpled a wad of banknotes into a small ball, and skillfully tossed it to the owner of the bar. He loudly called out:</p>
<p>"Hey, liquor!"</p>
<p>"Vodka?"</p>
<p>"Did you think it was champagne?"</p>
<p>Then, the bar owner gave him a glass of vodka, and a look of revulsion from the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>He indifferently took the glass, drank it in one gulp, and casually took a slice of sausage with his hand. Skillfully! He tossed it into his mouth, chewed it, and left.</p>
<p>The owner of the bar, with a strange and disgusted gaze, followed the back of this dissolute and unrefined customer.</p>
<p>After he left the bar, he let the warmth of the alcohol resist the cold outside: because under his fine clothes, he wore a cheap shirt and underpants—already dirty and torn: if someone discovered his discordant attire, it would become evidence of his guilt. Therefore, he deliberately walked slowly, controlling his impatient mood; and, he kept swinging his cane, breaking the complete snow surface on the pavement—showing a triumphant and leisurely expression after the hunt.</p>
<p>So, how could any detective, even with experienced eyes, prove that he was a secret messenger? (4)</p>
