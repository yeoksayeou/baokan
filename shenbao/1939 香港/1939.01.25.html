<h3 id="c1">發展游擊區與爭取×僞軍 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>這幾天的各區戰報，說明第二期抗戰，快到全面開展的時候了。華北華南各地×軍，經過三四個月的調遣部署，正在開始大規模的蠢動；華中方面×軍，也在準備一個總攻，連日江北×軍之圖越京隨而迫襄樊，江南×軍之窺伺長沙南昌，以至全部淪陷地區×軍的展開所謂「肅淸運動，都可說明×軍是在以各路騷動的軍事步驟，選擇其總攻的目標，企圖逞其孤注一擲。「大戰瞬將爆發」，倒不是毫無根據的呼號！</p>
<p>但從歲序更新以來三星期內的南北戰况觀察，×方在這次新的進攻中必將發生與加重的缺點和困難，已經不斷暴露出來。譬如在這次「山西總攻」，×軍雖已改取針對我方運動戰的新戰略。但是他們兵力依然不能不分散，他們士氣則一天衰落一天，却是造成這次失敗的主要原因。又如在這次廣東方面的戰事中，×軍雖然採取西北兩路並進的攻勢，然而他們同時不能不用女量兵力於東路一帶，結果是西路旣成流寇式的騷擾，毫無進展，北路方面的主力亦在我雄厚的大軍迎擊之下，受到重大創傷。爲什麽×軍在這次總攻的試探中就會遭遇這種挫敗呢？第一是由於×軍的攻擊精神和戰鬥力量，已在過去十八個月的戰爭中日漸消磨削弱以至於泯沒，相反的是厭戰情緒的激昂和反戰思想的普遍。據中央社廿三日淮陰電稱，江陰×軍五百餘名，日前突然全部譁變，×司令亦被槍殺，並大量燒殺刼掠，便是一個新鮮的鐵證。第二，是由於×軍　控制下的僞軍的動搖，叛變，和向我軍大量携械反正。以至×軍的攻擊精神愈加衰落，戰鬥力量愈加削弱。這些例證是舉不勝舉的，本報桂林二十日專電稱，當塗僞游擊隊槍殺其長官，全部向新四軍投誠，中央社廿二日西安電，靈邱僞警十三日全部反正，廿四日各報載東北僞軍醞釀繼續叛變與義勇軍及深入熱河的八路軍聯合抗日，都是最近的事實。第三是由於我最高當局對於游擊戰爭的重視，除了明白規定「游擊戰重於陣地戰，」作爲二期抗戰主要綱領以外，還先後委出指揮×後抗戰的特別戰區司令，成立戰區黨政委員會，而最近綏，察，熱，冀，魯，蘇，皖，浙各地游擊戰，尤有重大發展，造成了×軍進攻中的重大困難，甚至成爲×軍進攻中的致命的打擊！</p>
<p>所有這些×我最近戰爭的新的特徵，說明了兩點：卽第一，×軍正在開始其更大的進攻車事步驟，但是×軍存在許多困難，特別是在進攻中日益顯露的攻擊精神的衰落，戰鬥力量的削弱，僞軍動搖叛變的前後相繼，和後方混亂局面的嚴重。第二是我們如果能够以更大的努力，去發展游擊區，爭取×僞軍的叛變與反正，則×重這種困難必將更加嚴重，不僅將猛烈地阻礙了他們新的進攻，而且將無情地强迫他們放棄進攻，力圖保守。</p>
<p>從上面的分析中，我們可以斷言，二期抗戰中，×人進攻，將是更加瘋狂冒險更加殘酷猛烈，然而我們仍有方法仍有力量可以阻止×人的進攻。最主要的就是發展游擊區和爭取×僞軍。關於前者，我們要以更大的努力，團結×後地區的一切抗日力量，建立鞏固及發展所有抗日政權與軍隊，加緊×後軍民中間的政治工作，統一游擊戰爭的指揮，推進游擊區的民主政治，振肅游擊區的軍隊紀律，摧毀游擊區的×僞政權，同時必須組織較大規模的游擊區挺進兵團，和訓練出數十萬堅强的政治工作幹部人材，不斷地增援到南北各游擊區去！關於後者，我們要以更大的努力，擴大對×軍僞軍的政治工作，甚至派遣意志堅定精明强幹的幹部深入×偽軍去，提高僞軍的民族自尊心自信心，促發×軍官兵　，本法西斯軍閥的覺悟與决心，組織更大規模的×僞軍進攻中的怠戰運動，不開火運動，反戰運動以至集團的反正和譁變。不過我們要進行這兩種偉大的鬥爭，第一必須堅持全國團結抗戰到底，第二必須全力保障政治的進步，對於一切利用「反共」「和平」煙幕而出現的挑撥離間分化分裂等等陰謀，不問來自×國或發自內部，都應加以無情的打擊、務求其澈底肅淸。</p>
<h3 id="c2">馮副委員長講　中蘇關係　各民主國與我不少幫助　出力最大的還要算蘇聯 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>【成都通訊】五日午後三時、中蘇文化協會分會特請該協會名譽會長馮煥章先生、在靑年會大禮堂講演、計到各機關、團體、報館代表五六百人、會塲惜太小、很多人乃鵠立門外、至閉會時方散、首由主席鄧君淳先生說明此次歡迎馮先生、不僅因爲馮先生是該會名譽會長、也是因　馮先生的苦幹、努力精神、素爲全國上下的敬佩、所以我們在這盛大的敬慕之下、特歡迎馮先生並致敬意、馮先生乃在熱烈掌聲中登豪、馮氏全部談話親切、有力而且富有很濃學的趣味、故在馮先生講演中獲得掌笑聲不少、茲簡錄馮先生講演詞於後、以饗讀者、</p>
<p>『歡迎是不敢當、同各位見面却很榮幸、首先談兩件事情、第一本人此次由國府派到各地、所以首先代　　府向諸位問好、其次本人出發臨行時受最高領袖之託、　向全國父老兄弟致　問之　、關於　到中蘇關係、蘇聯是我們的好友、這不僅因爲總理曾經訂下親蘇政策、同時蘇聯因爲自己苦幹的精神、亦正可作我們的好榜樣、能給我們很大的鼓勵、目　、我們發動了抵抗我們的仇人——日本×國主義的鬥爭、一面當然由我們自己的努力、而另一方面、蘇聯聯苦革命鬥爭的歷史正作了我們的先例、</p>
<p>我們　次抗戰、自然全靠自己的力量、但是有朋友幫忙、我們也是極端的、萬分的歡迎、蘇聯這位朋友、對我們眞是幫忙了不少、尤其是這侵略的日×像瘋狗一樣的時候、對我們的援助更可貴、抗戰以來、各民主國家對我們自然帮助了不少、但出力最大的、還是要算蘇聯、委員長曾經說過、幫忙不是空話、而應該是事實、</p>
<p>再談到抗日的戰爭　現在日本是越打越壞、而我們是越打越見好了、有很多事實證明、我在此地會着李軍長、他說　以前前綫士兵怕打仗、要×人來了才打、不來就算了、而現在、兵士不怕了、×人不釆、我們還偏要打他、我們眞是越打越硬起來了、我覺得四川進步多了、很多優秀的幹部、都是廿二四歲的軍校學生、而一般的壯丁都壯健英勇、眞像一娘養的一樣、問他們爲甚麽當兵、他們的囘答是「爲國家」再還說是「爲祖先、爲子孫、爲自己要得好日子過」、在以前他們只能空洞的囘答說爲了「保國衛民」、然而現在他們已經眞正了解、眞正的進步了、</p>
<p>在上海、南京、徐州、濟南、北平、以及整個×人後方、無處不有我軍在向×人作不斷戰爭、使×人後方、也變成了前方、簡直無法應付、保守困難、這種好的現象、就是由於我有訓練的軍隊、與民衆合作打成一片的結果、以前軍隊、不到×後、但現在則非靠×人的抗戰工作加緊不可、河北省主席鹿鍾麟、現在河北成立省府、有六十四縣、都仍然是我們的地方、×人無力過問、所以目前我們的軍隊、都很願到×後工作、　×後已到沒法支持現局的時候、若吾人努力持久戰下去、最後勝利、是絕對不成問題、我以爲持久戰的意義就像水滴石穿一樣、純鋸樹斷一樣、白螞蟻打樹子一樣、雖然一時不見得有很大效力、但結果是會成功的、不過這種成功、是需要自己努力的、萬不能坐着等待、像癮君子們、只顧燒　、好賭的人們、只知打牌、那是不行的、我們如果能够努力、可以說努力十分、只要一年、便會打敗日本、若努力廿分、使只要六個月、努力四十分、就只要三個月了、總之、我們越努力、勝利越來得快、</p>
<p>這裏我對於中　文化協會諸君之貢獻、就是（一）多翻譯蘇聯作品、不管是軍事的、或政治的、經濟的、文學的、都可多翻譯出來、并不僅翻譯在報紙上登幾篇大文章、目應注意民間宣傳、編成唱本等方式、遍佈民間、（二）把我們抗戰以來可歌可泣的英勇事蹟、譯成俄文、使外人明瞭我們的努力、結能給我以更大的帮助、譬如閣海文的抗戰事蹟、一經利用外文譯出、就是×國報紙、也大登特登、承認我軍作戰的英勇、欽佩我軍爲國效忠的偉大精神、</p>
<p>最後、我還有一個好消息吿訴各位、從前我們陸軍學校的敎授、沒有蘇無人、盡是日本人、德國人、現在却是歡迎蘇聯人了、蘇聯是我們的友邦、已派來很多軍事學專家、爲我們訓練新軍、這可謂是我們値得高興的事、希望大家安心努力、前途是絕對樂觀、</p>

<p>— 本報昆明特約記者李寶泉</p>
<p>李先生今年是整整的六十歲，在國家的各種重要職　幾乎都輪到他去幹過的。他除了最早由日本留　歸來時，所任的講武常總辦以外，其餘像　贛湘邊防軍務督辦，軍政部長兼　二軍長，海疆防督辦，滇軍總司令，南韶連鎭守使，瓊崖鎭守使等。像上面那些類于『軍事』的範圍之外，李先生在「政治經濟』這方面，也是有着過人底研究與發展的。我們令國的　標局，最早的手創者就是李先生。像什麽農商　長，國務總理，陜西省長，國會議員等文職，李先生也都担任過，而且有着極佳底成績的。不過，李先生雖是由淸宋民初起就不斷的　任國家要職，但至今還只是兩袖淸風。他在蘇州的時候，會於小王山築宅隱居，到蘇州一失陷，　所有的產業也就都喪失了。這次來昆明的一切生活，還是出於各門生故舊們捐助的。像李先生這樣一位歷居國家要　的人物，到現在仍是度着淸苦的生活。這也就是爲他人所不及之處</p>
<p>我和李先到生談這次來雲的　命和工作，他老先生就不假思索地說道：「雲南是我的故鄉，雲南現在的地力長官像龍主席等，都是和我私人有着歷史關係的。不過，我這次還雲南來，並不是來和龍主席們叙舊，也並不是計劃省政，那些都是有關我私人的問題，我不願和龍主席們將此作爲主要的談話題目。我一遇見　主席，就聲明我還次來昆明，完全爲了雲南現在所處於全國的交通，政治，敎育，軍事等各方面，巳形成了一個重要的中心地點：雲南現在不但是西南的一個重要省份，也是全國的一個要地了。我們要商量國家長期抗戰的計劃，巳經够我們談了，那些私人的問題，假使與國家直接間接都沒有重大關係的時候，我們是來不及去談的了。』</p>
<p>那是眞的，李先生現在所注意與發表的問題，都是着眼在整個國家上面的，好像最近爲了「滇緬鐵路的南北綫問題』李先生曾上函給蔣委員長，那是完全着眼在日後全國邊防，政治，經濟，文化等各方面纔講話的，絲毫不存一些自　的念頭。在這一點上，就可看出李先生平日做人底那種態度的。</p>
<p>日內孔行政院長、曾有電請李先生針重慶共商國事，但李先生因病體尙未完全復原，醫生不放他卽刻搭乘飛機前去，所以就婉詞暫辭，等日後復原了就再前往。</p>
<p>最後，我和他設到汪兆銘氏的變節與全國抗戰中雲的軍政立場，李先生就很堅决地說道：「汪氏根據他過去的種種反覆無常。這次變節也自是意想中事，這種　心病狂的東西、我們現在可似不必多提他了。至於在這國家全　畏期抗戰之中，雲南是完全以中央意志爲意志的，雖至一兵一卒，也决不放棄這主張，請你在報上吿訴國內外的申報讀者好了，我能够負着一切的担保責任』。</p>
<p>李先生雖是越講越興奮起來，但　了地的病體還未—分復原、記者不敢再事多談，於是就向李先生吿辭了出來，因着我多次的請求，李先生繼在大門口和我拉着手，停止了送行的脚步。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c16">康藏關係新紀元（一） <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 劉尊棋</p>
<p>一、康藏紛爭的癥結</p>
<p>在遜淸以前，不存在所謂　藏關係，有的祗是康　對中國本部的關係。元明兩代，對於康藏的異族，一味騙　，而康藏內部，因爲　敎勢力尙在萌芽，也沒有許多力量向外伸張。明末，黃敎勢力，漸次駕幻敎之上，同時自己的經　權興武力，日在擴大中，淸太宗時。西藏的逹賴班禪及藏巴汗，靑海固始汗，竟自動地派遣使節，到盛京質獻方物，淸太宗因欲滅明，恐蒙之爲息，今獲此機緣，正中下懷，乃于　德八年，遣使存問達賴班禪，稱爲金剛大士。但還期間，仍爲單純對藏問題。</p>
<p>不過，黃敎喇嘛之政治軍事力量，巳逐漸發展至西康全部，與元明所封之僧王土司，到處抗衡，康熙三十九年，西康喋巴昌側集烈居然占據打箭爐，公開東犯，企圍越大渡河攻濾定，後來雖經四川總餐席爾達，巡撫貝和諾，提督唐希順，會疏　剿，克復爐城，擒斬昌側集烈，規復土司職務，但康藏之間，從此伸多事了。</p>
<p>同時，英國兵倂印度以後，爲對帝俄警戒計，企圖利用西藏爲　藩，也開始進行各種工作。</p>
<p>直到光緒卅年，淸廷鑒於××××××，知非積極經營西康，不足以內衛四川。　令四川總督錫良，會同駐藏大臣有泰，帮辦大臣鳳全，乘機收復瞻對，以固邊疆。就中鳳全最爲積極、翌年，行至巴塘，因辦堅務、而戕殺。卅二年秋，淸廷在西康設　川滇邊務大臣，以趙爾　任之，趙受命以後，練兵屯墾，改土歸流，銳意經營，五年之問，成績斐然。</p>
<p>關於趙　　經營西　的歷史，自非本文所能　述。但自趙起，西康乃以具特殊地位與西藏發生種種之關係，則爲重要事實。在趙爾　時代，對於土司，固　毫不姑息；卽對喇嘛寺的割據和跋扈，也毫不容情。但他在積極方面，尙能慘淡經營，公明廉正不予藏人車大口實。可是趙死後的繼續者，自幷昌衡以下，如民二的張煦，民三的劉銳恒，民四的股承獻，民五至民十三的陳遐斷，民十三至民十六的劉成動，則一貫兵威，旣不足以震　，政績又多　散不堪，甚至縱兵攘民，蹂躪喇嘛，以致引起黃敎輕視漢人二公開反抗的事件。如劉　卿女十在「康藏征』（質三〇）中所記述的事「…裏塘（卽理化）情形，與外間逈異，境內無一戍卒，所謂官吏，漢宰守二人而巳。人民在前時深遭軍人之蹂躪，故激起反攻，而作自衛之運動。常時屯兵均强駐喇嘛寺內一，挾喇嘛以要人民，若派欵，派差，稍逆其意，卽申言將縱火焚廟，並屠喇嘛。士人對於喇嘛，均非常敬重，往往忍辱求全，終以積怨過深，突然爆發，　將兵士　行驅逐出境。……』這些不可諱言的專實，給了西藏方面援助西康若干反抗勢力機會，而其最顯著的演變，則爲自民十九以來擾摟將近上年的甘孜喇嘛等—大金寺—的案件，近十數年來，大金寺案件，據着康藏問題中的决定地位、雙方幾次見諸干戈，糾　不决。小的方面，祗是一兩　喇嘛寺的鬥爭，大的方面，則爲西康對西藏的整個問題，若更擴而大之，簡直不妨說是含有嚴重國際意義的糾紛。</p>
<p>但是，這一個重大複雜的糾紛，却在本月二日西康省政府成立的第二天，以互讓互　的精神，在德格縣圓滿解决。使康藏間的關係，劃一新紀元，這是在抗戰較艱苦的今夭，尤其具有偉大的意養，是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>現在我們且把大金寺案本身的始末，作一報吿。</p>
<p>二、由寺爭至康藏衝突</p>
<p>大金寺　西康北路有名的大喇嘛寺，位於甘孜縣境，在縣西北六十里。寺有嘲嘛二千多人，共人　雖不及甘孜寺之多，（甘孜寺有四千人）但他具有兩大將點：第一，廟產極大，操縱北路以及對藏貿易，收人最丯據說寺內窖藏邊　銀，一可供全康駐軍十年薪餉之用；第二，　接藏，經德　而金沙汀兩岸聯絡。有奥援可恃。因此之故，寺內喇嘛，旣有錢　有勢，一面對其他喇嘛極盡　壓之能事一面對漢族官府，肆無忌彈。</p>
<p>事件的肇始，是很微細，但經過複雜的演變，卒致成康藏正面的衛突。原來大金寺的東南隣爲白利土司的轄境，境內有三大喇嘛寺：——白利寺，春則寺，亞拉寺，距令一百年前，白利寺曾遭匪洗刦，後藉亞拉寺僧衆之力將匪逐退，白利土司感激之餘，許亞拉寺大僧共同治理白利寺</p>
<p>問題發生於亞拉寺的一個呼關克圖（主持）一死後，『轉世』於大金寺內的寧冲之桑多家　呼圖克　，名爲亞拉古子。曾經其家庭送往拉　留學，學成後，卽徇自利土司之龍，由人金境內接至白利主持亞拉寺，同時自然也可以康理白利寺。當時白利寺已殘破不堪，亞拉子古出其家財，爲之條茸，恢復舊觀，正　此時，白利老土司死去，無子，祗有一女，嫁與軋土司之子，後被軋　土司之妻逐去，囘家後，私生一子，乃以此子，繼存白和土司。</p>
<p>正當這白利士司孤弱之際，上面說過的春朋寺呼圖克圖，便垂涎亞拉寺的廟產，及　補勢。乃蠱惑白利士司之女（卽被逐之軋　土司之媳），驅逐亞拉子古。亞拉子古被逼逐回大金境內的寧冲本家後，卽請大金寺出而報復，大金寺　來　橫無忌，’得此機會，自更「當仁不讓」，於是　突便發生了。</p>
<p>在民國十九年冬季，一個演『跳神一的日子，大金寺就派人將亞　寺縱火焚燬。喇嘛對於燒寺，認爲最大汚辱。所以這一來，便改成整白利方面的公憤。白利三大喇嘛寺。便聯合起來與大金寺開火；結果，當然是白利方面敵不過大金一，它就一面開始屈服，一面訴請甘孜縣政府，出而伸雪。縣府最初欲持平調解，因大金拒絕接受一，乃轉由駐軍（劉文　部）武力鎭壓，軍隊到後，大金寺知道亂子弄大了，便索性求救於金砂江岸絨　岔的藏軍，藏方助以大批軍火，後來幷直接出兵，與白利及劉文軍部作戰，至此，大金白利之爭就轉變爲康藏正面的面突了。</p>
<p>三，由開戰到停戰</p>
<p>雙方衛突約兩　月。（民二十春）。劉文輝曾電請中央指示。中央認為茲事體人，便於廿年三月廿九日派　柯三入康調理，同時，又拉　，淸達賴派人會同唐柯三交涉，　　　電，派阿不客動到甘　負責調解；誰知阿丕行到昌都，就逗留不進，區持六閱月之久，這時一九一』事件發生，藏方乘機愈　祖　大金等，而和　即完全失敗，唐柯三無結果而回。漢藏兩年，於是在金沙　東岸，正式戰爭起來，經過整整一年。藏軍漸漸不支，陸續退出德格，鄧科白玉，石渠四怒，全部撤至金沙江以西，同時並派員與劉軍在金沙江東岸德格屬之矮達簽訂一停戰條件一。這些條件，以前因種種關係，未能發表，現在事件結束，不妨公開了。茲條其全文如次：【未完】</p>

<p>國難嚴重至此，全國一切有生力量與無生力量、都應集中貢獻於××建國事紫，所以一切日常生活與社會酬應的消費、都應減縮至最低限度，忍個人時淸苦，求子孫百代幸福，求民族萬世自由，揆情處理，均屬至要。</p>
<p>據本報重慶廿四日專電「渝市社會局决定，宴客筵席每桌不得過八元，六榮一湯。　名」儉德席』，如違决懲。」此舉的確値得爲全國各地倡導，特別是『儉德』兩字，似乎較諸『節約』更有意義。</p>
<p>農曆新年將屆，依照社會習慣，吾人勤勞終年，此時盡情歡暢一下，固然未可厚非，然而囘首祖國，烽火遍野，環顧四週，難民如蟻，稍有人心者，未有不爲之心動的，因此我們雖不敢厚望僑港各界同　，一致實行『儉德席』運動，但望各業均能義賣一天，盡力捐助兵災難民。更希望各關係團體，擴大募捐運動，積極推進救濟難民援助××的工作，一，還偵運動，尤當發展光榮的競賽。祖國同胞，痛遭××鐵騎蹂躪，砲火摧殘，猶在刻苦奮鬥，力行儉德；前線將士，方爲民族解放，浴血抗戰，　戰愈奮；我僑胞倫生海外，所以報國而求心安者，首在踴躍捐輸—幸望讀者，以身作則，輾轉相吿，庶幾可在友邦人士之前毫無愧色！</p>

<p>美國紐約華沙女子大學舉行的世界二次靑年和平大會，參加大會的五十餘國代表一致通過援助我國抗戰要求，决議（一）停止運輸軍用品與煤油接濟日卒，並拒絕借欵於日本，（二）各國政府應實行抵制日貨；（三）各國民衆應切實擴大抵制日貨運動，並提　購買中國貨；（四）國際保證借欵與中國，以協助中國充實國防及推進內部建設。由此可以証明全世界靑年對於我幽反對日本法西斯侵略的同情護，也証明了我國抗戰同時就是維護世界和平的意義，已爲全世界靑年所共認。但是我們要把這國際的助力，無限的擴大，成爲一種制裁日本及德意法西斯侵略者的無敵的力量，那要，我們今日的努力與成就，顯然還是非常不够的—我們必須加倍努力健全與發展全國靑年本身的統一戰綫，同時加倍努力推進全世界靑年反法西斯反侵略的統一戰綫。本港靑年學生更應認淸自己在當前緊急階段中的偉大任務，發楊光大過去的成就，加倍努力的從理論鬥爭與救亡工作中鍛鍊自己，敎育大衆，擴展統一戰綫。</p>
<h3 id="c29">國社黨窺伺下的羅馬尼亞（續） <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>羅馬尼亞是巴爾幹半島各國之一，他的命運與其他各國休戚相關，過去小協約國包括捷克，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，現在事實上已不存在，另外產生了一個巴爾幹聯盟，包括羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，希臘和土耳其。羅馬尼亞的南鄰布加利亞因爲與匈牙利同樣情形，不在其內。不過剛剛被他們包圍在中間。</p>
<p>明興會議以後，絕馬尼亞與希臘的國王和南斯拉夫的攝政王都先後訪英。巴爾幹聯盟各國的參謀本部任雅典　會，共謀自衛。提出了「巴爾幹屬於巴爾幹各國』的口號。反對外力侵入。主張積極實際解决少數民族問題的糾紛。</p>
<p>他們在七月卅一日與布加利亞在沙隆尼加開會簽訂了互不侵犯條約，允許布加利亞重整軍備。法國幷且偕給布加利亞大批借欵，雙方增進商務關係，這不能說不是布加利亞反法西斯的象徵。八月間巴爾幹各國在勃來特開會又答應匈牙利重整軍備，目的都在調整巴爾幹各國的本身關係，去抵抗法西斯的侵略。</p>
<p>最近希臘國王喬治在倫敦對星期前　報記者瑪杜爾氏發表談話說：『我們巴爾幹半島的人們，今天已經給全世界一個榜樣。大家在絕對和乎的方式之下解决了相互問的糾紛。現在各國大家諒解希土之間各不設防。在九月間歐洲危機之中，巴爾幹各國都團結一致，準備　戰。我們已成爲七千萬人的民族，有五百萬兵可以開赴前綫作戰。」</p>
<p>英國保守黨領袖邱吉兩最近在「東歐險象」這篇文章裏曾論到巴爾幹半島各國的前途，大意說波蘭雖然分得捷克的德城，不過希特勒就要向　索價。所謂大烏克蘭獨立運動的對象，在波蘭就是但澤與走廊地帶。蘇聯也許會不致袖手旁觀。外長柏克所以急於簽訂波蘇新約的目的就在這裏。</p>
<p>東歐各國在明興會議之後，險象環生，都像驚弓之烏。目前獨立和平的國家，說不定誰將成爲希特的犧牲品。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的形勢非常緊張，不過最近英王接見卡羅爾的結果，給與倫敦方面一個很好印象。覺得他很有才幹，頗能歷險如夷。不過羅馬尼亞有了石油與谷物，國內的少數民挨和待機報復的鄰國匈牙利，地的國運總很險惡。</p>
<p>這兩個被威脅的國家幸與蘇聯毗鄰。蘇聯在遠東的貢献，已很値得英美的欽佩。在歐洲方面，他將如何應付，當然很値得注意。</p>
<p>戰後的士耳其巳經成爲一種不可侮的力量。希臘與土耳其很親善，而兩國的對英關係也從無齟齬。英國今年曾借給土耳其六百萬　借欵，對土耳其有很大的助力，博得不少好感。希臘國王旅英多年，其人英明果斷，頗能與英合作。這三個國家的聯合，對於布加相亞有很好的影響。自沙隆尼加會議以後，她巳經重新加入巴爾幹各國的集團，這就是具體的表示。</p>
<p>「這些國家如果能够個結起來，組成一個武裝的和平堡壘，國泰民安是不成問題的。否則就會給德國個別撃破，他們如果放任國內法西斯邪說流行，那末大難就在眼前」。</p>
<p>所以擺在羅馬尼亞面前的只有兩條出路，就是投降或抵抗。羅馬尼亞在捷克分割以後，也正和匈牙利在德國兼倂奧大利後一樣。在國社黨勢力直接壓迫之下，客觀上巳經不允她再騎兩頭馬而同時周旋於兩種勢力之間。他是侵略者東進中的最後一關，也就是英法在近東寶庫的最後門戶。羅馬尼亞之得失，對於希特勒霸業之成敗是有决定　義的。第一條路非常簡單，結果也很明顯。投降以後，德國將取得其資源，特別是現代機械化武器所需要的石油。不論卡羅　的贊座能否保持，羅馬尼亞就會在希特勒的走狗如鐵衛團和日耳曼黨之類的壟斷之下去當國　黨東征軍的先驅而供其犧牲，淪爲歐洲惡戰的層塲。</p>
<p>抵抗是比較可能的另一出路。這是目前舉國上下，除掉國社黨走狗之外，一致主張的共同方向。根據國際間種種優勢客觀條件看來，希特勒雖然神通廣大，只要反法西斯蒂的國際統一戰綫建立起來，一個希特勒還是不够打</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的命運繫於國內團結　侮的决心和歐洲反法西斯蒂國際統一戰綫的完成。正如李維諾夫所說「和平不能分割」只有在集體安全制度之下，羅馬尼亞才有光明的前途。　（完）</p>

<p>全世界青年　同情我抗戰</p>
<p>開會前、本報記者為明瞭國際間反侵略之動態、特別提出幾個問題叩詢李代表、蒙李君不憚麻煩地、因他那沉毅而温和的態度、應答這樣一席使人無限感奮的談話、第二次世界靑年和平大會充分同情我國英勇的抗戰、一致反對日本法西斯的侵略、空氣是非常緊張的、紐約的僑胞嘗在大會中燃放煙火、映出我們的國旗、蔣委員長的肯像、及中華民國萬歲字樣、博得　場國際友人熱烈的同情與致敬、</p>
<p>會議時、意大利沒有代表出席、德國却有某團體的一名代表、但是、他是同情和平陣線、反對自己政府的侵略行爲、日本呢、居然亦有　　　的五個靑年會代表參加、當大會一致同惰我國、秤擊日本的時候、這幾位日本軍閥　　、亦嘗起來『咬屎糖辯』、可是、在全　　棄鄙視之下、亦只好在　　公理面前垂頭喪氣、</p>

<p>各國援華制日的宣傳品無所不有、而普遍到每一個角落去的、就是寫着下面字樣的卡片——我不買日本貨、因爲我不願意買炸彈給日本去慘殺中國的人民、</p>
<p>這種國際宣傳的力量是非常宏大的、各國的商人拒賣日貨、工人罷運日貨、像風氣雲湧一般地流行着、</p>
<p>—李君答記者的這一席談話眞敎記者無限興奮、由於國際同情的趨於積極、越是覺得自家應該爭氣、黑暗不會永遠遮住光明、公理不會永遠屈服於強權、只要我們苦撑抗戰、一定可以得到最後的勝利、李代表這次從歐美各國婦來又帶給我們多一個抗戰必勝的眞憑實據、</p>

<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>沿江毗連於博羅威下的鄕村，　屬的　百足嶺，惠屬的爲水西尾被焚殺頗慘，每鄉損失十之七八。截至此段爲止，百足嶺西水尾以下幸獲恙無。所以在　一段的水程中，仍得倚舷縱目，欣賞到蔗地　田，靑葱若　，一切農村中天然的美景。×人的魔手雖多，必不能抓過我們的七地，是永遠可以相信的。</p>
<p>蘇村，東岸，橋頭三個墟市，均隱處東江的中下游域，鼎足分立。幸而這次×人的進攻華南，自惠州登陸以後，進犯的路線全重於陸路，沿公路或鐵路發展。故惠州而達石能的河道，雖陷入敵人的包圍圈內，但僅有小部×兵經過一次，能够避出×人的蹂躪。同時，現在盤踞石龍的×軍，擾騷祇達於東傳，東博距離這三個墟市尙有二十餘里，在我們反攻聲中，自更不敢猖獗再上了。所以，這個地帶，目前似可稱之爲桃源地帶。不過我們必須將這世外的桃源改建爲東江的前衛。</p>
<p>蘇村屬博羅的第三區，和惠陽的廣和墟夾江而峙。全墟不過百多間店戶，範圍不很大。戰事未發生前，這裏　有部隊一營，爲了交通的捷，曾架了一座浮橋通到對岸的廣和。惠州失陷，×騎兵十餘人循甲廣公路自甲子步直趨廣和，蘇村的守軍斷橋抵抗。×人知不能渡，才廢然而返，蘇村一帶也才得保存。據土人云：在×騎兵經過廣州的源頭時，有兩個鄕民站在公路旁邊觀看，驚異他們服裝的奇特，問他們是中央軍還是×××，一個被他們砍死，一個竄到蔗地裏遁云。從這一段傳說中，我們深深的感覺中國農鄉的政治宣傳工作的不够。現在的蘇村，商場上漸漸地恢復舊觀，不過行政自衞的工作、距　態尙遠，這是整個機構問題。可見中國過去的政治革新，都不過是僅有其形，官　文章。無論保甲或其他種種制度基礎仍鬆，稍過打擊，便難收拾，殊値得我們注意，</p>
<p>從蘇村再下十餘里便是東岸，規模和蘇村差不多。因爲未受砲火的波及，墟中裏的街道，舖戶還完整如故。不過因爲匪患的彌漫，交通的梗塞，商業冷淡了許多。聞諸土人云，自蘇村到東岸，在何經，赤嶺下幾處，有搶匪以下四五起。遇船隻通過，則鳴槍制止，刦搶凈盡，始呼嘯而去。商人們雖富於冒險精神的，但要冒幾度的險，恐非容易，自然不敢往來貿易了。可是我們來時，却見不到動靜，大約或已歛跡了。事後記者和那裏的一位鄉畏會晤，談及這種情形，提供了一個聯防的意見。像西江一樣，將河道劃分若干段，分段由近鄉防守，他很欣然採納。歸途中遇見了新委的蘇村巡官陳伯良，又提出　貢献，也很贊同。記者總希望有實現的一天。事實上前方與後方消息相關，後方有三點壞處，前方即减低一點力量。</p>
<p>東岸再下却是鐵江，爲了種種護送的困難，不能冉去，祇好在東岸的江邊遙遙遠眺而已。蒼茫的烟水，起伏的雲山，刻劃出中國美　的山河，刻劃出東江俊秀的姿態。猶記敵人佔領惠州後，遣派了六七百人乘船順流而下，其中二三百人便玻東莞的自衞團殲減於鐵江江面。這次榮　戰是値得紀載的，可惜記者如能親往徘徊，未免有點餘憾。</p>
<p>橋頭屬東莞縣。從東岸去要渡過東江後冉渡一道沙河，土人稱之爲小香港，雖然未免譽之過火，但市面確也相當繁盛。舉只都市中的特　，像妓院，茶樓，婦招待，煙館，煙花，賭場，多半具備。從還裏可以經長平站出香港，往來有大鷄六所組繳的商團獲送，每担貨物收護送費二元左右，所以橋頭現在成爲東江中下游的總出入口處和經濟中心。一個草澤英雄在此國難期中，上乘的固然應當參加戰鬥隊伍，中乘的也應衞護商閭，維持地方。大鷄六現似仍不失爲中乘人物。同時要特別提出表揚的，東莞縣境內，匪患較少，算是一個優點。　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c36">海南島 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— 黃警頑</p>
<p>中國第一大島—海南島，舊稱瓊崖島，屬廣東省，本來海南島並沒有資格來承受這個尊稱—中國第一大島的，因爲雖然我國沿海的許多島嶼大多是面積狹小，但是福建省對面的那個出產糖的著名地台灣，却要比他大得多了，可是不幸得很，我們這位島嶼的老大哥早由淸廷割讓給日本，因此這位小弟弟才有資格來奪得他哥哥的領銜，今日它孤零零地站在南海中，要知道他的情形究竟怎樣，現在我分四方面來觀察。從政治上來觀察海南島</p>
<p>從政治上來觀察海南島</p>
<p>海南島古時又稱爲百越，直到秦平南越後，才將它晝入象郡管轄，漢時，開始設置耳，珠崖二郡，晉時，屬台浦郡，那時災黎紛紛南遷，飄泊到海南島去，這便是我國移民至海南島的開始。及至唐宋兩朝，它竟變爲名賢遷謫的聖地了，讀過中國歷史的，一定知道宋朝蘇東坡謫居於萬州，唐朝的李德裕被貶於岸州，…但是這個大島因爲霧雨很多，氣候異常潮濕，交通更是不便，商業當然沒有發達，因此，在一般人眼中，都是以「蠻荒惡土」的錯誤觀念視之，不但古代這樣，就是前廣東省政府在統治的時候於政治的措施上也時常矢其常態，很少爲島民的利益及國富開發着想。因此海南島至今有二千五百餘年的歷史，在險惡的國際現勢中仍能保持其領土的完整與主權的獨立，眞是一件非常憢倖而可慶賀的事情。在目前，太平洋上所有的島嶼已都被帝國中義者用不同的姿態——侵吞的侵吞，保護的保護——駕食殆盡的時候。碩果僅存的海南島已成爲各帝國主義者上目所視，十手所指的標的了，事實吿訴我們：海南島上已是「山雨欲來風滿樓』，我們不但應該積極地武裝保衞大海南；而且消極地也不應忘了對於海南島的速事開發，以增强我們的經濟堡壘。</p>
<p>從國防上來觀察海南島</p>
<p>我們如從國防的地理上來說，大凡一個海陸交通樞要的地方，它對於國防一定有舉足輕重的影響，海南島北隔瓊州海峽，和雷州半島相望，南臨婆羅洲及荷屬爪哇西按法領安南，東接菲律賓羣島，全島面積爲三萬三千七百餘方公里，分爲十六縣，黎毌山矗立在中央，島熱狹長，它是海軍的重要根據地，是東亞航綫所必經的地方，合灣與海南兩島是中國東南的兩眼，現在一目雖已失却，至少不應使他雙目失明才是，島上的楡林港可作爲國防上極優良的電港，因爲它是歐洲航行東來的第一重門戶，歷史已證明這句話的確實性了，（日俄大戰時，波羅的海艦隊泊於此，）日本的海軍大佐曾「贊譽」海南島是日本的生命綫，他說，「海南島是對兩廣作戰的根據地，倘日本能控齣楡林港作軍港，使所有的優秀艦隊都集中在這裏，他就可馬上對當地的形勢採取主動的地位，不但可以牽制中國的南海，並且减低香港的軍事價値，間接地剝削了英國的在遠東的利益，使刹衣港的法國艦隊望洋興歎、美國優秀艦隊的航程也成爲他的甕中之　，於是日本控制了外南洋的海權，當然可以以東方盟主自居了。「國父孫總理早巳有鑒於此，因此在他的建國方略中曾計劃開發此港爲中國南部的軍港，綜合全島的形勢來觀察，它實在是太平洋上很重要的根據地，也是目前中日戰爭中保衞華南的門戶！</p>
<p>從經濟上來觀察海南島</p>
<p>國人限中「蠻荒惡土』的海南島，實在是一塊未開墾的處女地，農業方面因氣候的適宜，天然的七地又異常肥沃，因此島民大都以農爲生，樓榔，椰子，橡膠，芭蕉等的熱帶植物，每年都有驚人的出產，這些出產。不但在工業上是主要的原料，並且在軍事化學工業上，他們也是不能缺乏的原料，此外，生活必需品的出產，如米，甘蔗，花生，咖啡，茶，豆，及烟草等產，也極　富，至於礦藏方面，銅，銀，鐵，錫，鉛等均有出產，因爲沒有充分的資本，所以對這些天然的寶藏都禾曾充分開採，其他，大部份島民賴以生活的畜牧業，每年牛，羊，豕，鷄等的出口，成爲香港唯一的進口，　的出產成爲海南島的重要產業，又因爲一環滁皆海也」，豐富的漁塲，更是佈滿各地，雖因捕魚方法的幼稚，以及日本漁船的競爭，但是出產仍很可觀，綜上觀之，我們若能充分地開發海南島，這中國第一大島的地位，一定能與台灣並駕齊驅的。</p>
<p>從文化上來觀察海南島</p>
<p>全島的居民可分爲兩種，約一百八十萬的漢人與九六十萬的蕃屬漢族大多是廣東，福建，廣西，及少數浙江人，蕃族分生黎，苗黎，黎，歧黎四種，人口的分佈，以瓊州爲中心，漢族都居于平地，黎族除少數的水屬外，大都居於深山中，並且橫蠻異常，毫無文化可言，語言當然是異常復雜了，據說要在本島居住，至少須聽得懂五六種語言，否則你便大感困難了本地居民都是愚昧不堪，鄕人頭腦的簡單，知識的寡陋，意識的腐舊，與行動的粗野，無一不使人歎息和危懼，救國的工作，到底不是從上而下的，「愚民百萬，謂之無民』、非僅「無民」，往往容易變成「叛民」，因爲這種人民最易被×人所收買與利用，甚至做了漢奸還不自知覺，中華民族到了最危急的時候，我們應該珍惜一分一毫的財力與人力，不讓他有一些些的消費與遺棄，那麼海南島上的二百四十萬人力，難道我們白白地讓他擱棄。</p>
<p>保術大海南，開發大海南。</p>

<p>娛樂…破落戶現形記</p>
<p>Beg　Borrowor　Steal是一部瘋狂諧趣的喜劇、故事是說一個　身高級社會的　子、時常口出人言、一次他向妻女誇說他已在里維拉地方、置下別墅，不意這無意的謊　　妻女都以爲實、又適逢女兒　行出嫁、便打算在別墅中舉行　　、這編子因爲　猶在耳、幷不願意傷他愛女的心情、迫不得已、向人求借別墅一所、暫充闊　、同時又請了一班同行好兄弟、冒充貴要客人、後來却因受那一班騙了的包圍、與及警　的監視，同時女兒又發　愛錯了人、把事情越點　糟、直到他維持不了的時候、爲了愛女的緣故、才勇敢的揭穿自己的黑幕</p>
<p>法蘭克摩根熟練老到的演技、製作了不少的笑料、男女主角約翰比兒、弗洛倫絲、絲、在本片中兩性　逐的演作、也參加　少的羅曼絲趣味、總之本片是一部娛人的作品、</p>
<p>東方…紅顏易老</p>
<p>Yorue　Only　Young　Once</p>
<p>這一部很有意識的影片、給予靑年男女在戀愛上的啓示、故事非常簡單、是描寫一个很美滿的家庭、主人是一位公正賢明的法官、有子女各一、都在靑春的時代、當他們一家去加州行時、他的子女都走入了錯綜戀愛的歧途、幸虧他們父親苦心地　正他們、從險境中救出來、</p>
<p>演員方面、當然是魯意史東爲最成功，他那神對於年靑人懷戀的心理寫、同時他自己誠盡的態度、都勾劃得很淸楚、西雪麗派克和密　羅納兩人亦很稱、</p>
<p>皇后…軍校兩球王</p>
<p>Touchdown　Army</p>
<p>本片大部份是以美國West　Point軍校爲背景、表現　嚴明的紀律、齊　的會區、又穿插着一段三角的戀愛喜劇、更殿以一場緊張熱鬧的足球賽、這種故事的取村、巳是數見不鮮、但全劇的演出、尙有相當之成就、</p>
<p>內容描寫一個虛浮的公子哥兒、爲了一個女子、甘心入軍校、受盡種種的磨錄、不意這女子的苦心、却已別有所屬、後因他球藝的高超、大出風頭、才博得那女子的靑睞、</p>
<p>片中球賽與及會　等場面、大部份由時事片剪接而成、但因技術的巧妙、遂不稍露痕跡、約翰霍沾在片中飾一小敎官、沒有他演偵探片那樣精彩、</p>
<p>平安…最後勝利</p>
<p>Whlte　Banners</p>
<p>由文豪　持德格拉斯近著「白幟一改編的、故事本身　味很濃厚、本劇編要妥善、演員支配也稱得體、全片演出極爲動　、固爲太倫理氣味、　許爲一般人所感不到興趣、但耐心　下去、却有今人感覺到可取了、</p>
<p>克勞特倫斯、歷來　出，都很有成績、這次他飾一位愛好工作的敎師、演出可謂入　了、加之幾位配角如費斐德、賈克古相、及素演反派角色的童　羅尼泰格倫維攻變作風而　一熱情的少費、都很優秀令人滿意、</p>
<p>大華…小霸王</p>
<p>Toe　Little　Tough　Guy</p>
<p>就是『窮街陋巷』裏的一實頑童、有兩位很能演戯的却不曾在本片裏演出、情節和以　的作品大同小異、一輩頑童終被捕入感化　裏受感化、演出上也較差、</p>
<p>景星…未來世界</p>
<p>Thngs　to　Come</p>
<p>中央…珍珠衫</p>
<p>好萊塢的陳査禮逝世才不久，中國電影界便有凍査禮的產生、這種投機的手段、旣無須耗費宣傳之勞、而能坐收號之效、中國片家的聰明、於此可見一班、但本片內容故事的編排未能盡書、同時各緊張塲面，也皆未能儘量發揮、對於盜匪輩的行爲動作的描寫，失敗多於成功、演員之支配也不甚適台、除劉瓊有相當成甚之外、顧蘭君和洪警鈴沒就戯做、徐華園的陳査禮。面部化較頗能近似、但動作方面的摹仿則尙未談得、</p>

<h3 id="c54">七峯遺編 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 勻君</p>
<p>—民族小說話</p>
<p>收在咸陽說苑甲編裏的七峯遺編，最近纔有單行本可讀。書是七峯樵道人撰，書前有自序，於著者事跡並無所發明。全　雖有六十囘，但每回僅有數百字，最短者祗有二百字，如第三回，最長的如十四，五三，五四幾回，也不過一千多字，這和通常章囘長篇頗不同，而書中涉及的範圍頗爲廣泛，但又缺少組織，看起來頗像雜記似的，據孫揩第中國通俗小說書目「補正」中說「與另」本文言記事之海角遺編同。』書中以常熱福山兩地反抗淸人的薙髮和組織民軍的始末爲主，間亦叙及南京弘光朝事跡（第一二兩囘）和鄰縣蘇州江陰因同一事件所激起的民變（十五至十七，四十九諸囘）遺編中所叙述的範園頗廣，地城有都會，城市，鄉鎭，村莊，而人物也上至皇帝，親王，官僚，軍人以及漢奸大小走狗，市井無賴，記出混亂時各方的醜態，而記述較詳的都是當時鄕閒的情祝，這大約是撰者所親歷的吧。</p>
<p>就全書論，寫得實在平平，雖找不出多大的缺點，但優點一個也找不到，除了乾燥無味的記事外，連對話都很少，從文郵的觀點說，更是什麽都談不到，然而這書是不能當作小說般看待，而是應當作爲史料理解的，這樣，纔不會誤解它，歷史的意義，如書內記淸軍的搜刼子女玉帛，獸性的屠殺，都是資貴的文獻，三十五囘記陳汝揚慘死說；「城破，家僅奔報，不能行走，夫妻惟對泣而已。被兵丁綁在陸貽吉家旗竿七，其妻則槍戮死於家中牀下，第三日，兵去後，里人見之，以刀斷其縛，而喉中尙有餘氣作聲。』這種絕滅人性的暴行，不論誰見了也會感憤的。然而有誰想到在二百餘年後的今日，還遭到比這更慘的待遇呢！</p>
<p>譽中也曾指出當時抗戰失敗的諸因素，如官軍將領的毫無鬥志，擁兵自衛，一經失敗，便慌亂逃走，第四回的鄭總兵，第八回的胡來貢便是這一類的典型人物，甚至於仗義兵名義，處張聲勢，專以搜刮錢糧，打刦民財寫事，如二十，二十一，二十三諸回所記。而民軍方面除了嚴栻部下以外、大都是乘亂時借兵復仇，以致紀律毫無，甚至互相殘殺（四十囘至四上三回所記）；一遇戰事反而按兵不動，或紛紛散去，如胡龍光無心守城，坐說淸兵攻城而一矢不發（二十八回），時子求部下，一聞城陷消息便全部星散（三十一回）。而主其事者或書生談兵，毫無準備，如金鑛援救江陰，事先旣無聯絡，戰時又無計劃（十八回）；或乘機擁兵，並無國族認識，如二十六回所記時子求，四—二囘所記之凌四，而當時官吏縉紳，又不惜靦顏降×，爲虎作倀如錢謙益，蕭世恩，馬縣丞之流，都先後爲×所用：卽守土有責者，如曹元芳等在城陷之前便隻身先逃，民衆方面除茍全性命以外，對於國族安危也毫不關心，而最可痛的是民軍中竟有甘心爲×作嚮導的漢奸趙伯韜，蓋亦當時的王八妹，徐鴻發之類。這些雖是歷史上的陳跡，但沉痛的敎訓也會使生在二百餘年後的我們感憤的—</p>
<p>全書似以嚴拭起鄉兵，爲主幹，但因人物衆多，頭緒紛繁，反把主要人物的地位削减了許多，記嚴氏的事僅不過五六囘，寫他用乒的前後又只有兩次，顯然是是失掉全書的統一性，又如閩典史的抗戰，和江陰全城人民的壯烈犧牲，都是極好的題材，作者全沒有好好地運用，祗有輕描淡寫的幾句敷衍過去，反而努力去寫鄕間人民的私鬥和死中逃生的故事，估了全書四分之一，（如二十二，二十八，三十，三十四至三十六，三十八，四十至四十三，五十，五十一，五十三，五十四，共十五回）不免輕重倒置了作者是目睹淸兵屠殺的，對於鄕兵起　按理應有一點好感才對，然而他並不，反認爲那是多事，如二十二囘叙陳孟立「遇事敢言一謂：「常熱彈丸之地耳，淸朝勢大，只宜着人到彼講和，觀其動靜。若遽起兵，是運螳臂當車也。』而三十七回作者本人也居然站出來說：「俱是竹愴木棍，白布裏頭。要與淸朝厮殺，眞螳臂當車也。』這和現在的「惟武器論一者眞是一鼻孔出氣了。作者是明人，對於明之亡國。也應有故國禾黍之思，如五十五囘記改滿裝約文字，至少要有一點感慨之類，可是除了『而風俗亦一大變更矣』，什麽也沒說。而最後又頌揚着異族的統治者及其功狗；『自此揚練兵之威名日盛，海上兵（指明義陽王兵）莫敢犯境，百姓重享太平之福矣。」幾個月前瘋狂的大屠殺，被作者完全忘掉了！像七峯樵這人這樣苟安健忘的人，在現在未必很少，也討會拉他去認爲二百多年前約知己吧。要避免這惡影響，是决定於讀者的分寸的。這書在同一叢書內，其價値要次於「痛史」好幾倍。</p>
<h3 id="c55">希望及其他 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 楊彥歧</p>
<p>當然沒有一個人沒有希望，也沒有一個人不要自己的希望實現，可是很少人知道希望是世界上最空虛，最無用，最薄，最輕的東西。它是小孩子的面孔，是太平洋上的一葉扁舟，永遠不會被人們把握住，也永遠在玩弄着人們的心，所以，憧憬希望，是人們最愛做的事，也是人們做得最笨的事。</p>
<p>以前我聽人家說『別憂慮了。明天的光明就要來到』。這類話，好像心頭很舒服；對是對的，可是錯了。天亮是天天有的，儘管說『明天的光明』也的確是『就要來到」；可是一味期待，等到明天，依舊是一團黑暗，所亮的不過是早晨的太陽而巳。</p>
<p>天亮，不是跟着「明天」來的，是由人們一手造成，拿來放在未來的境地，讓他在「明天」的衣裙下，一起走來。來了，當然歡迎；沒有來，就表示我們根本不配受到光明的照臨。</p>
<p>說起希望，一掉頭，就看到囘憶。</p>
<p>囘慷也是人類的寵物。過去是甜蜜的，是的，過去是美麗的，又怎樣呢？反轉時代的巨輪嗎？拉回巳逝的時間嗎？可惜人類沒有這種本事。</p>
<p>尤其在文章裏，感慨人人有，又何必老躭在夢中喊一聲『悲哀』，嘆幾句「去年今日……」？人是多情的，我承認，並且我也常常會滿肚子感慨。不過我相信除了感慨之外沒有話可以說。我也常常寫回憶之類的東西，好像心頭所有的懷念越積越多，壓得實在太重，不能不出情一下。而其實呢，在腦子角　裏，正有許多値得說出來給別人聽的話。那不是牢騷，口號，人云亦云的順毛論調，風凉話，更不是抄抄這個抄抄那個的雜會湯，而是自己的生活體騐。自己的見聞，自己領會到的知識。</p>
<p>至於想條，也可以說是幻想，却不能說沒有價値。好的小說，好的戯劇，一定要在想像中洗鍊過，才會美麗，才會染上文學的味道。</p>
<p>希望，人人都有；囘憶，也是人人都有。但是因爲人人都有，就不値錢，應該把腦筋從希望和囘憶中逃出來，躱在腦壳外面，深入現實的境地，或者多加一些思慮，多想想，少做做夢。這樣，也許我們的文壇消爽些，會明朗些，會實在些，會整齊些，更有一點値得盼望的，便是我們的文擅也許就此能够少浪費一點墨水，節省一點紙張。而十足的反映出這個大時代。</p>
<p>當然，誰不願意抓住這個寫作史詩的好機會，讓血和肉交織成一幅圖盡，刻劃出今日的人間，永遠遺留在世界上呢？</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>所謂請客，拿到兵士之間來，那種紳縮性實在太大了。普通人，一請客起碼得上飯館，一百八十那都不算數，而在兵士們中，卽便你買了三分錢的菱角，也可以得到「請客』的　　了。</p>
<p>然而就在這種情形下，彼此間有些『道義』豎起來「根基』『互助』之花遍生在每個人的心里，盡管大家夥先是從各個不同地方聚攏來的，而這時却成了生死的難友。自然，有時候也免不了因爲一點細小的原故，就弄得面　耳赤的，甚而面對面罵上媽長爹短的幾句，但那不要緊，過去一天，用不到誰來解勸，就會言歸於好的。</p>
<p>淋山河的小飯館，終於還是在我們的身上作到了他們的賞資。爲什麽不吃一頓呢。在原來缽剳的地方，不是連個鷄蛋也　不到麽。不是有好多人喊着「見甩」的　。那是一個僻塞的小村，連根油條都買不到，自然更提不到飯館了。伙食上的飯食，雖然還不缺少肉，然而人們全把那叫「猪食」，吃得不順咀。</p>
<p>「夥計，先來四兩酒！」</p>
<p>酒是兵七們特別歡迎的，恰如他們歡迎香烟，這類乎可笑的舉動，外人看來也許會搖頭，但我們却毫不在意。</p>
<p>『切魚肉來！』</p>
<p>『鹹鴨蛋拿幾個！』</p>
<p>那老板笑嘻喀地走過來，手裏捧看一條大魚，擠着眼睛說道：</p>
<p>『同志們，可要這條魚麽？』</p>
<p>『多少錢？』</p>
<p>『還能多算你們麽。』</p>
<p>『快去作，　得好好的！』</p>
<p>下午又出發了，每人覺得身上都加了不少氣力。</p>
<p>四、生活在鄉間的別一種人</p>
<p>從淋山河前進，公路太難走了，路面完全是用石塊墊成的，脚走上去　得十分疼痛：好在走了不遠，就岔到小路上去，小草如茵，却很平坦。但路是愈來愈窄，而且又鑽入山路，沒有在公路走着時那樣寬敞。</p>
<p>念路路的旁邊，在一片平地上，停放着五六輛砲車，砲口上面蓋着雨布，車上面加了僞裝，每輛車下全有一名躺臥的看砲兵士，可是他們的眼睛是早就合在一起了，我們的脚步聲驚不醒他們的好夢，睡覺已經在不知覺中使他們忘記了各自的職守。</p>
<p>但這些砲，正是我們消喊×人的利器啊，看它們踞伏在路旁有多麽威武，多方着人愛載呀！</p>
<p>拐過一條小石橋之後，山路愈發窄狹了，一眼望出去，左邊是丘陵，右邊是山坡，前後雖然各有路口，再遠地方也還是起伏的小山，只有山中的來道，算是往來的通路。天還是陰着，且仍在　着風，擺得山坡上的松林直響。幾片落葉被捲到空中去了。是秋天了，秋天是容易呌人們有感觸，可是對於一個兵，起不了多大的反應。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c57">趕集 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 繼良</p>
<p>在目前四川的北倍，還留存了一種中世紀的交易方式——趕集。</p>
<p>這兒本地人稱趕集爲趕塲，每逢一個月中的初一和月半，是北倍趕塲的日期，這一天，四鄉各處的貨物，都集中在這個小市鎭上，在街道的兩旁，在靠近在嘉陵江邊的沙灘上，是堆滿了各鄕搬來的貨物，也放滿了各種不同的商品，這見附近一帶的居民，亦各由各個的村莊裏趕了來，你覺得熱鬧，也覺得嘈雜。</p>
<p>趕場的商品是有一定的排列方式，使購買者很方便，鄉下人的生產品全在這一天拿到這兒來陳列，大致米，荳，蔬菜之類，是放在比較熱鬧的大街上，革鞋，土布，碗筷等貨品，又集中在另外的一塊交易地，其他像猪，鴨鷄等家畜，大都是，聚集在沿汀邊一帶的沙灘上，至於臨時設立的攤販，亦都會集在這兒，所以趕場時期的北倍，平時絕無一人到的沙灘，亦都變成了重要的交易所，假使你乘了飛機經過這兒的上空，你會懷疑也許在開會。</p>
<p>筆者在趕塲的貨品中，曾在出賣蔬菜攤販的邊旁立了好一會，看到許多衣飾入時的下江人，嘴裏强學着不流利的四川話，在那蔬菜的攤子旁徘徊着，臉上顯然的現着有難色，「四川省的人喜歡吃辣椒菜，我們祇有老吃靑菜了，「筆者注意了一下在旁的蔬菜，除了靑采之外，就是蒜，春菜，辣椒，這些菜全不合一般下江人的口味，水鄕的人來到山國裏，不容易吃着活潑新鮮的魚，却時常把筷子停在辛辣味上，這確也是件苦事，從戰區裏來的下江人，還是掉囘頭來打回老家去吧！</p>
<p>在這一羣趕塌的人們裏，記者曾從一位賣布的小販談話中，樑得了他們平時期的生活情形，據聞在大部份赴趕塲的商人裏，有百分之八十是全賴每次趕塲的收入，來維持其全家的生命的，雖然他們每次趕塲所得的錢是有限，但因爲他們的貨物，在過去是不要經過政府的抽稅，再加他們自己生活的開支很低，因此，他們每次趕塲的收入，若能得養六七元的數目，便已達到他們最高的滿足了，至於古代「以物易物』的方式，這終究已成爲過去式的賣買，現在這見的趕塲上，亦已看不到此種的現象。</p>
<p>每當北倍趕場的時候，從早晨六時到下午四時，人頭總是　得滿滿的，走去了這一批，又換來了那一羣，看起來他們似乎都很繁忙，其實你若把他們每人的行動，細加分析後，知道這裏面還夾雜了許多並非　了交易而來的人，有趁這趕場的機會，來和他們的親友約會的，也有專來看熱鬧的，他們雖各由異處集在同一的場所，但各人的心裏却都隠藏着有不同的希望。</p>
<p>近來因爲戰區的擴大，北倍已還來了許多機關和學校，商店亦開設了許多，不像往日，這見的生意彷彿成爲零星的。點綴的，經過這次的變更後，北倍的商業想亦會漸漸地現代化起來。</p>

<p>在它們沒有來襲前，</p>
<p>許多人甚至連日本是什麽也不知道；</p>
<p>但，現在，飛機炸彈却變成了最好的致本</p>

<h3 id="e1">Developing Guerrilla Zones and Winning Over Puppet Troops <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The war reports from various districts these past few days indicate that the second phase of the War of Resistance is quickly approaching full-scale development. The Japanese troops in North and South China, after three or four months of redeployment, are beginning to stir on a large scale; the Japanese troops in Central China are also preparing for a general offensive. The Japanese troops north of the Yangtze River are attempting to advance on Yuejing [Nanjing] and then press on Xiangfan. The Japanese troops in the areas that have fallen under occupation are launching what they call "cleanup campaigns." All this indicates that the Japanese troops are using military steps of disturbance in all directions to select the target of their general offensive, attempting to gamble on a single throw of the dice. The cry that "a major battle is about to break out" is not without foundation!</p>
<p>However, from the observation of the war situation in the north and south within three weeks since the beginning of the new year, the shortcomings and difficulties that the Japanese side will inevitably encounter and exacerbate in this new offensive have been constantly exposed. For example, in this "Shanxi general offensive," although the Japanese troops have changed to a new strategy targeting our mobile warfare, their forces still cannot avoid being dispersed, and their morale is declining day by day. This is the main reason for this failure. In the Guangdong battles, although the Japanese troops adopted a two-pronged offensive from the northwest, they could not avoid using a considerable amount of force in the eastern region at the same time. As a result, the western route became a bandit-like harassment with no progress, and the main force on the northern route suffered significant damage under the attack of our powerful army. Why did the Japanese troops encounter such setbacks in this probing general offensive? First, because the Japanese troops' offensive spirit and combat power have been gradually worn down, weakened, and even eliminated in the past eighteen months of war. On the contrary, the eagerness to avoid war and the prevalence of anti-war ideas are increasing. According to a Central News Agency report from Huaiyin on the 23rd, more than 500 Japanese troops in Jiangyin suddenly mutinied, and the Japanese commander was shot. They also engaged in extensive burning, killing, and looting, which is a fresh and ironclad proof. Second, it is due to the wavering and rebellion of the puppet troops under the control of the Japanese army and the large-scale defection to our army with weapons. As a result, the attacking spirit of the Japanese army has become more and more weak, and the combat power has become more and more weakened. These examples are too numerous to mention. A special dispatch from Guilin in this newspaper on the 20th stated that the puppet guerrillas in Dangtu shot their officers and all surrendered to the New Fourth Army. A Central News Agency report from Xi'an on the 22nd stated that the puppet police in Lingqiu defected entirely on the 13th. Reports in various newspapers on the 24th stated that the puppet troops in the Northeast were brewing a continuous rebellion and joining forces with the volunteer army and the Eighth Route Army that had penetrated into Jehol [Rehe] to resist Japan. These are all recent facts. Third, it is due to the importance attached to guerrilla warfare by our highest authorities. In addition to clearly stipulating that "guerrilla warfare is more important than positional warfare" as the main guideline for the second phase of the War of Resistance, special war zone commanders have been appointed successively to direct the War of Resistance behind enemy lines, and war zone party and government committees have been established. The guerrilla warfare in Suiyuan, Chahar, Jehol, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang and other places has seen significant development, creating major difficulties for the Japanese army's offensive, and even becoming a fatal blow to the Japanese army's offensive!</p>
<p>All these new features of the recent war between us and the Japanese demonstrate two points: First, the Japanese army is beginning its larger offensive steps, but the Japanese army has many difficulties, especially the increasingly obvious decline in the offensive spirit in the offensive, the weakening of combat power, the successive defections of the puppet troops, and the seriousness of the chaotic situation in the rear. Second, if we can make greater efforts to develop the guerrilla zones and win over the rebellion and defection of the Japanese and puppet troops, the Japanese army will face even more serious difficulties, which will not only strongly hinder their new offensive but also ruthlessly force them to abandon the offensive and try to conserve their strength.</p>
<p>From the above analysis, we can assert that during the second phase of the War of Resistance, the Japanese offensive will be more crazy, adventurous, cruel, and fierce. However, we still have methods and power to stop the Japanese offensive. The most important thing is to develop the guerrilla zones and win over the Japanese and puppet troops. Regarding the former, we must make greater efforts to unite all anti-Japanese forces in the areas behind enemy lines, establish, consolidate, and develop all anti-Japanese political power and armies, intensify the political work among the military and civilians behind enemy lines, unify the command of guerrilla warfare, promote democratic politics in the guerrilla zones, revitalize the military discipline in the guerrilla zones, and destroy the Japanese and puppet regimes in the guerrilla zones. At the same time, we must organize larger-scale guerrilla zone advance corps and train hundreds of thousands of strong political work cadres to continuously reinforce the guerrilla zones in the north and south! Regarding the latter, we must make greater efforts to expand the political work against the Japanese and puppet troops, and even send firm, capable, and strong cadres to infiltrate the Japanese and puppet troops, enhance the national self-esteem and self-confidence of the puppet troops, and promote the realization and determination of the Japanese officers and soldiers against the fascist military阀. Organize a larger-scale movement of avoiding battle, refusing to fire, anti-war, and even group defection and mutiny among the Japanese and puppet troops during the offensive. However, to carry out these two great struggles, first, we must insist on national unity to resist Japan to the end, and second, we must fully guarantee political progress. For all conspiracies of provocation, alienation, and division, etc., that use the smoke screen of "anti-communism" and "peace," no matter whether they come from Japan or originate internally, they should be ruthlessly attacked and thoroughly eliminated.</p>

<p>[Chengdu Dispatch] At 3:00 PM on the 5th, the Chengdu branch of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association specially invited Mr. Feng Huanzhang, the honorary president of the association, to give a speech in the auditorium of the Youth Association. About five to six hundred representatives from various agencies, organizations, and newspapers attended. Unfortunately, the venue was too small, and many people had to stand outside the door until the meeting ended. First, Chairman Deng Junchun explained that the welcome to Mr. Feng was not only because he was the honorary president of the association, but also because Mr. Feng's hard work and dedication were respected by the whole country. Therefore, with this grand admiration, we specially welcome and pay tribute to Mr. Feng. Mr. Feng then stepped onto the platform amid warm applause. Mr. Feng's entire talk was cordial, powerful, and full of scholarly interest. Therefore, Mr. Feng received a lot of applause and laughter during his speech. The following is a brief record of Mr. Feng's speech for the readers:</p>
<p>"I dare not accept the welcome, but I am very honored to meet with you all. First, let me talk about two things. First, I was sent to various places by the National Government, so first, let me extend greetings to you on behalf of the National Government. Second, when I was about to depart, I was entrusted by the Supreme Leader to extend his greetings to the elders and brothers of the whole country. Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union is our good friend. This is not only because Premier Sun Yat-sen once established a pro-Soviet policy, but also because the Soviet Union's spirit of hard work can serve as a good example for us and can give us great encouragement. At present, we have launched a struggle to resist our enemy—Japanese imperialism. On the one hand, of course, we rely on our own efforts, and on the other hand, the history of the Soviet Union's hard revolutionary struggle has served as our precedent.</p>
<p>Our War of Resistance naturally depends entirely on our own strength, but we also extremely and fully welcome the help of friends. The Soviet Union, this friend, has really helped us a lot, especially when the invading Japanese are like mad dogs, their assistance is even more valuable. Since the War of Resistance, various democratic countries have naturally helped us a lot, but the Soviet Union has exerted the greatest effort. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said that help is not just empty words, but should be facts.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the War of Resistance. Now Japan is getting worse and worse, and we are getting better and better. There are many facts to prove this. I met General Li here. He said that before, the soldiers on the front line were afraid of fighting. They would only fight when the Japanese came, and if they didn't come, they wouldn't fight. But now, the soldiers are not afraid. If the Japanese don't come, we will fight them anyway. We are really getting tougher and tougher. I think Sichuan has made a lot of progress. Many excellent cadres are military academy students in their early twenties, and the general laborers are strong and brave, just like they are raised by one mother. When asked why they joined the army, their answer is "for the country," and then they say "for our ancestors, for our descendants, and for ourselves to have a good life." In the past, they could only vaguely answer that it was to "protect the country and defend the people," but now they have truly understood and truly progressed.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Jinan, Beiping, and the entire Japanese-occupied rear area, our army is constantly waging war against the Japanese, making the Japanese rear area also become the front line. They simply cannot cope and have difficulty maintaining control. This good phenomenon is the result of the cooperation between our trained army and the people. In the past, the army did not go behind enemy lines, but now it is essential to intensify the anti-Japanese work behind enemy lines. The Chairman of Hebei Province, Lu Zhonglin, has now established a provincial government in Hebei. There are sixty-four counties, all of which are still our territory. The Japanese have no power to intervene. Therefore, at present, our troops are very willing to work behind enemy lines. The Japanese army behind enemy lines has reached a point where it cannot support the current situation. If we persevere in a protracted war, the final victory is absolutely not a problem. I believe that the meaning of protracted war is like water dripping on stone, sawing a tree in half, or termites attacking a tree. Although it may not be very effective in the short term, the result will be successful. However, this kind of success requires our own efforts and we cannot just sit and wait, like opium addicts who only care about smoking opium or gamblers who only know how to play cards. If we can work hard, we can say that if we work hard enough, we can defeat Japan in just one year. If we work twenty times harder, it will only take six months. If we work forty times harder, it will only take three months. In short, the harder we work, the faster victory will come.</p>
<p>Here, I believe that the contributions of the members of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association are: (1) translate more Soviet works, whether military, political, economic, or literary, and do not just translate a few articles in newspapers. Attention should be paid to public propaganda, compiling ballads, etc., to spread among the people; (2) translate our heroic deeds since the War of Resistance into Russian, so that foreigners can understand our efforts and give us greater assistance. For example, the anti-Japanese deeds of Ge Haowen, once translated into foreign languages, were extensively reported even by Japanese newspapers, acknowledging the bravery of our army and admiring the great spirit of our army in serving the country.</p>
<p>Finally, I have good news to tell you all. In the past, the professors in our military academies were all Japanese and German. Now, we welcome the Soviets. The Soviet Union is our friendly country and has sent many military experts to train our new army. This is something that we should be happy about. I hope everyone can work hard with peace of mind, and the future is absolutely optimistic."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Under the Double Oppression of the Japanese and Puppets, the People of Wuhu Suffer Unspeakable Hardship (Part 1): Major and Minor Traitors Run Rampant, Controlled by Us Five Miles from the City <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Wuhu Correspondence] Wuhu is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, upstream from Nanjing, and is the only large commercial port in Anhui Province. Major native products from southern and central Anhui, such as rice, tea, silk, and eggs, are exported from here. Imported goods such as silk, satin, oil, sugar, and foreign goods are also transferred to the interior from here. The city is prosperous, with a population of about 200,000. The important trunk roads in the city, such as Zhongshan Road, Beiping Road, Erjie, and Siming Road, have been widened and rebuilt and have become modern roads. The highways include the Jingwu Line, the Wutun Line (Wuhu to Tunxi), and the Wuwu Line (Wuhu across the river to Wuwei County). The railways include the Jingsun Line of the Jiangnan Railway (from Jing [Nanjing] to Sunjiabu in Yicheng) and the Yuhe Line of the Huainan Railway (Yuhan [from Wuhu across the river] to Hefei). Various Yangtze River shipping companies have wharf terminals and warehouses in Wuhu. Water and land transportation is very convenient. At the beginning of the August 13th War of Resistance, many people along the Jinghu Line fled to Wuhu, so the population increased and the market was prosperous before the city fell. When Guangde fell and Yicheng was suddenly bombed, the people of Wuhu were greatly panicked. Then Wuhu was also bombed, and the people fled everywhere, which was extremely tragic. The Administrative Commissioner's Office withdrew to Wuwei County. Then, the vanguard of the Japanese army arrived in Wuhu from Gaochun, Jiangsu, via Shuiyang Island Creek (under the jurisdiction of Dangtu County), and carried out large-scale burning, looting, raping, and killing. The brutal acts were countless. Later, corrupt officials, corrupt merchants, local ruffians, and hooligans established the so-called "Autonomous Committee" under the instigation of the Japanese comfort squad. The puppet chairman was Zhu Feng, and the puppet committee members were Wang Mengshou, Yu Shuoping, Xie Xuelin, Wang Zidong, Wang Xiaofu, Wang Shancheng, Wei Minqiang, Song Jiemi, Li Huinong, etc. The puppet committee members believed that the place was full of scars and the population could be used. Therefore, they begged the Japanese side to allow them to sell the salt stored in the warehouse by the salt merchants, the rice accumulated in the locality, and the goods of the unmanned shops in the whole port (to be continued)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing to this newspaper on the 24th] According to reports, our guerrillas in the suburbs of Guangzhou and on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway are constantly engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army. Our coastal defenses in southern Guangdong have been strengthened and there is no cause for concern.</p>
<p>[Foreign News from Hong Kong on the 24th] Japan's offensive in South China may have new developments recently, as the Japanese side has decided to attempt to invade Guangxi along the Xijiang River and the Beihai area. According to reliable news this morning, the Chinese land artillery positions in Beihai have already been fighting with the Japanese warships anchored between Enzhou and Beihai. The Chinese side has greatly strengthened the coastal defense works, and the Japanese air force activities have also increased compared to before. The strength of the Japanese army encircling Guangzhou has also been substantially increased. It is said that these troops have all been transferred from the north and are now moving towards the Xijiang River. It is also reported that the elite troops of the Japanese army invading along the Yuehan Railway have been specially withdrawn and transferred to the Xijiang River area.</p>
<p>[Macau Report on the 20th] A yet unconfirmed message was received here last night, stating that several Chinese aircraft from Guilin flew to Beihai and Weizhou yesterday and bombed the Japanese fleet anchored there. Several Japanese ships, including a transport ship, were hit, and the losses were extremely large. There have been no changes in the situation in Beihai, Weizhou, and Hainan Island. Part of the Japanese army has landed on Enzhou Island.</p>
<p>(News from Hong Kong) A Westerner who arrived in Hong Kong from Beihai yesterday said that the situation in Beihai is very serious. The population has been evacuated, and the stores only open at night. However, it is very deserted, and the desolation is unprecedented. Recently, Japanese warships have been concentrated on Guozhou Island and Hainan Island. Yesterday, two 10,000-ton Japanese cruisers and a large aircraft carrier passed through the Hainan Strait. It seems that the Japanese army has Weizhou Island as its base, and every day they are seen flying into the interior through Beihai. Yesterday, a team of Japanese aircraft flew low along the coast of Beihai and strafed the residents on the water with machine guns. Yesterday, Saturday and Sunday, two Japanese armed fishing boats entered the Huahai port and then drove out without firing. Most of the stores in Beihai are now closed, and the people are taking down their doors and utensils and moving them inland to avoid providing resources to the Japanese army. There are many troops in the city, singing anti-Japanese patriotic songs in the evening and practicing shooting during the day. The atmosphere is very strong, and they are now ready for battle. Chaoan and other places were bombed.</p>

<p>[Shantou Report on the 24th] Japanese warships and aircraft have not been active here for a long time. Since yesterday, a Japanese cruiser anchored near Nanao and an aircraft have been bombing Lake An and Jieyang. The Xiangzi Bridge in Chaoan City was destroyed by bombing, and the long-distance bus station in Jieyang was bombed. The Japanese aircraft flew over Shantou four times on that day but did not bomb. When the Japanese aircraft bombed the Chaojie bus station on Sunday morning, machine gun fire was heard, injuring two people.</p>

They immediately invaded the sky and flew low over the area and bombed in the area of Zhaocheng and opened fire with machine guns. At the same time, ten Japanese aircraft invaded in batches and wantonly bombed the South Gate and North Gate in the city. Machine guns and bombs bombed each other, destroying more than 20 houses and killing or injuring 25 people.

Jiang Guangnai summoned by the authorities to fly to Chongqing, rumored to be appointed to an important military position.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Report on the 24th] According to people from Tianjin, the assassinations of Wang Zhulin, Jin Bicheng, Kawashima Yoshiko, and others in the British Concession of Tianjin were all planned by the Japanese and puppet forces. The Japanese side intends to use this to coerce the concession authorities, accuse them of harboring anti-Japanese elements, and demand inspections or the blockade of the British and French concessions.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Sino-Soviet Fisheries Negotiation Still Deadlocked: Accident Before Fishing Season Will Break Off Current Talks <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] The Sino-Soviet negotiation on the fisheries agreement remains at a standstill. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, once informed Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov that if the negotiations failed, the Soviet government should bear the responsibility. According to informed sources here, unless an unexpected situation arises before the fishing season begins in April this year, the current negotiations will inevitably break down beyond repair. The core dispute lies in the Soviet government's plan to hold a public tender for the management of fishing grounds in early February, insisting that all locations should be allocated to Japanese fishing companies and Soviet fishing machinery enterprises to prevent Japan from permanently enjoying fishing concessions. Although the Japanese side has not formally refused to participate in the bidding, it has rejected the principle of allocation, insisting that the lease of the fishery rights should be based on the terms of the Portsmouth Treaty (which only allows Japan to enjoy fishing rights in the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea, but not in other areas). However, the Soviet government denies that Japan enjoys any priority within Soviet territory and territorial waters, and is prepared to fully exercise its sovereignty, such as enacting fishing regulations. The Soviet side also accuses the Japanese government of being jealous of the rapid development of the Soviet fishing industry in recent years, and therefore deliberately trying to obstruct it. Several years ago, Soviet fishing vessels lacked both ships and personnel, and had to hire Japanese fishermen. Now, however, the Soviet Union has built many fishing vessels and trained its own fishermen, and is naturally unwilling to allow Japan to continue its monopoly. The temporary fisheries agreement, which expired last year, was signed by former Japanese Foreign Minister Koki Hirota and the late Deputy People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Lev Karakhan. The Soviet fishing rights in this agreement were quite restricted, with Japan only agreeing to provide the Soviet Union with a certain number of tons of fish caught each year in exchange. Some now claim that Karakhan was ousted because he was deemed a traitor for losing rights in the fisheries agreement. The gist of the Sino-Soviet fisheries issue is roughly as described above. As for the issue of labor contracts signed by the Soviet Sakhalin Island Japanese Merchant Oil Company and representatives of the Soviet Trade Union, negotiations have also not yet been successful.</p>

They also requested each commander to bring a report on the anti-Japanese activities of the local militia for reference. It is reported that Deputy Commander of the First Guerrilla District, Zhou Yanhua, and Deputy Commander of the Fourth Guerrilla District, Zhang Wodong, etc., have arrived in Hong Kong separately, and this morning (24th) at 4:00 AM, took the Xin Hai Men steamship to Shantou, transferring to another vessel to attend the meeting.

<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 24th] Chinese political figures claim, according to reliable sources, that Wang Jingwei is still in Hanoi, adopting a passive attitude. His plan to participate in the puppet government in Beiping has also been completely shelved due to the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet and the opposition of the puppet government in Nanjing. It is also said that Wang is currently adopting a "three nos" policy: not participating in puppet organizations, not approving scorched-earth resistance, and not interacting with the Hiranuma Cabinet. Relatives and friends refuse to entertain him.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 24th] According to Chinese reports, Mei Shiping, a confidant of Wang Jingwei, secretly arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that Mei and Lin Bosheng jointly issued Wang Jingwei's peace declaration to the press in Hong Kong. Afterwards, their official positions were dismissed by the National Government.

<h3 id="e14">Storm of Questions in the Japanese House of Representatives: No Solution to Fiscal and Diplomatic Issues; Representatives Pessimistic About the Future <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Foreign Dispatch from Hong Kong, 24th] During yesterday's meeting of the Japanese Diet, a countermeasure was decided upon in case economic sanctions were adopted by Britain or the United States. This warning was given in response to the concerns of representatives about the recent attitudes of Britain and the United States, and their demands that the Japanese government express its attitude. Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita rose to reply that Japan would resolutely continue its policy of establishing a new order in East Asia. If a third country were to intervene, Japan had already decided on a countermeasure. Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai also made a similar statement, saying that the Navy was sufficient to defend Japan, and that he did not believe that a third country would adopt extreme policies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A TASS dispatch from Tokyo, 24th, reports that the questioning period in the Tokyo Lower House of Representatives began on the 23rd. In addition to the questioning by Seiyukai party member Tagawa, reported in yesterday's telegram, there was also questioning by Seiyukai party member Miyazawa. The gist of his points was that renewing the administration, boosting morale, and establishing a wartime system were urgent tasks for the new cabinet, but the means of digesting public bonds and revitalizing foreign trade were prerequisites. Would the government compensate for the huge military expenditures of the past by increasing debt or increasing taxes? How would the huge amount of public bonds for the next year be digested? And rather than restricting imports, how would exports be revitalized? What were the government's countermeasures? Finance Minister Otohiko Ishiwata only replied that although the sale of public bonds had declined after October of last year, it had gradually recovered this spring. Although the Bank of Japan's banknotes had been issued to over 2.85 billion yen by the end of the year, they had now decreased to 2.1 billion yen. All of his responses were forcibly optimistic observations from pessimistic facts, and he avoided discussing the key points. Abe, the leader of the Social Masses Party, asked how the government would concentrate national strength to carry out its so-called long-term construction. Prime Minister Hiranuma had no concrete plan to answer, and his emptiness can be imagined. Miura, an executive member of the right-wing Toho Kai, asked why Arita's diplomacy was still a diplomacy of compromise, and why the government did not adopt a more proactive policy to handle the "China Incident." Arita replied that there was a fixed policy towards China, and that there was no need to cause unnecessary friction with third countries. The first round of questioning ended at this point. Looking at the questions from all parties, their sense of anxiety about the future was obvious. The answers from Hiranuma, Arita, and Ishiwata were still nothing more than a set of clichés.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A TASS dispatch from Tokyo, 24th, reports that according to official sources, the Japanese naval budget for 1939-1940 is 7.048 billion yen, of which 5 billion yen is for war expenses. The total national budget for Japan in 1939-1940 is 10 billion yen, which is expected to be submitted to the Diet for discussion in a few days.</p>
<p>Konoe Attacked by Representatives: To Resign as Minister Without Portfolio</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] The Japanese press suggests that former Prime Minister Konoe plans to resign from his position as Minister Without Portfolio in the current cabinet because Konoe did not attend the Diet yesterday. Many representatives in the Diet have asked Konoe to attend and explain why he, as a Privy Councillor, can simultaneously serve as a cabinet member and participate in practical politics. However, people in the Japanese government (especially in the army) claim that Konoe's situation should be an exception, which is sufficient to show that Japan's policy toward China has not changed. Konoe claimed that he did not attend yesterday's Diet due to illness.</p>
<h3 id="e15">A Record of the Visit with Mr. Li Genyuan, the Cultivator of Military Leaders in Our Country (Continued) <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Li Baoquan, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Kunming</p>
<p>Mr. Li is exactly sixty years old this year. He has held almost every important position in the country. Apart from being the chief instructor of the Yunnan Military Academy when he first returned from studying in Japan, he has also served as the Military Affairs Director of the Hunan-Jiangxi Border Defense, the Minister of Military Affairs and Commander of the Second Army, the Coastal Defense Director, the Commander-in-Chief of the Yunnan Army, the Garrison Commander of Nanxiong and Lianzhou, and the Garrison Commander of Qiongyai. Beyond these "military" positions, Mr. Li also has outstanding research and development in "politics and economics." Mr. Li was the original founder of our country's Bureau of Standards. Mr. Li has also held civilian positions such as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Prime Minister, Governor of Shaanxi Province, and Member of Parliament, and has achieved excellent results. However, although Mr. Li has been constantly serving in important national positions since the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, he still has nothing to his name. When he was in Suzhou, he built a house in Xiaowang Mountain for seclusion. When Suzhou fell, all his properties were lost. His current life in Kunming is supported by donations from his former students and friends. Mr. Li, a man who has held important national positions, still lives a simple life. This is something that others cannot match.</p>
<p>When I talked to Mr. Li about the purpose and work of his trip to Yunnan, he said without hesitation: "Yunnan is my hometown. The current local military and government leaders in Yunnan, like Chairman Long, have historical relationships with me privately. However, my return to Yunnan this time is not to reminisce with Chairman Long and others, nor is it to plan provincial affairs. Those are all personal matters, and I do not want to make them the main topic of discussion with Chairman Long and others. As soon as I met Chairman Long, I stated that my return to Kunming this time was entirely because Yunnan is now an important center for national transportation, politics, education, and military affairs. Yunnan is now not only an important province in the Southwest but also an important strategic location for the entire country. We have enough to talk about in discussing the national long-term resistance plan. We do not have time to discuss personal matters unless they have a direct or indirect significant relationship with the country."</p>
<p>That is true. The issues that Mr. Li is currently paying attention to and expressing are all focused on the entire country. For example, he recently wrote to Chairman Chiang regarding the "North-South Line issue of the Yunnan-Burma Railway," which was entirely based on the future of national border defense, politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, without any selfish thoughts. From this, one can see Mr. Li's usual attitude towards life.</p>
<p>Premier Kong of the Executive Yuan once telegraphed to invite Mr. Li to Chongqing to discuss national affairs, but Mr. Li declined for the time being because his health had not fully recovered and the doctor would not allow him to take a plane immediately. He will go there when he recovers in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, when I asked him about Wang Jingwei's defection and Yunnan's military and political stance in the national war of resistance, Mr. Li resolutely said: "Based on Wang's past repeated inconsistencies, this defection is expected. We don't need to mention this heartless and insane person too much now. As for Yunnan in this national long-term war of resistance, Yunnan completely takes the Central Government's will as its own. Even if it means sacrificing every soldier, we will never give up this position. Please tell the readers of Shenbao at home and abroad in the newspaper that I can take full responsibility for this guarantee."</p>
<p>Mr. Li became more and more excited as he spoke, but his health had not yet recovered. The reporter did not dare to talk more, so he said goodbye to Mr. Li. At my repeated request, Mr. Li continued to hold my hand at the gate, stopping my farewell steps. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e16">A New Era in the Relationship Between Kham and Tibet (Part 1) <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zunqi</p>
<p>I. The crux of the dispute between Kham and Tibet</p>
<p>Before the end of the Qing Dynasty, there was no so-called relationship between Kham and Tibet; what existed was the relationship between Kham and the Chinese mainland. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the foreign tribes of Kham and Tibet were deceived and subjugated. Internally, the religious forces in Kham and Tibet were still in their infancy, and they did not have much power to expand outwards. In the late Ming Dynasty, the Gelug sect gradually surpassed the Sakya sect, and at the same time, its economic power and military force were expanding day by day. During the reign of Qing Taizong, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama of Tibet and the Khoshut Khan of Qinghai even automatically sent envoys to Shengjing to offer local products. Qing Taizong, wishing to destroy the Ming Dynasty, was afraid of the Mongols, and this opportunity came at the right time. He sent envoys to inquire about the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama in the eighth year of Chongde, calling them Vajra Masters. But even during this period, it was still a simple Tibetan issue.</p>
<p>However, the political and military power of the Gelug sect lamas gradually developed to the entire area of ​​western Sichuan, everywhere confronting the monk kings and chieftains sealed by the Yuan and Ming dynasties. In the thirty-ninth year of Kangxi, Zhaba Changze Jielie of western Sichuan actually occupied Dajianlu, openly invading eastward, attempting to encircle Daduhe and attack Luding. Later, although the Sichuan Governor-General Xierda, Governor Beihenuo, and Admiral Tang Xishun jointly suppressed and quelled the rebellion, recaptured the city of Dajianlu, and captured and executed Changze Jielie, restoring the duties of the chieftains, trouble between Kham and Tibet has since become rampant.</p>
<p>At the same time, after Britain annexed India, in order to guard against imperial Russia, it attempted to use Tibet as a subordinate vassal, and began to carry out various activities.</p>
<p>It was not until the 30th year of Guangxu that the Qing court, realizing that it would be insufficient to defend Sichuan internally without actively managing western Sichuan, ordered the Sichuan Governor-General Xiliang to jointly recover Zhandui with the Tibetan Resident Minister You Tai and Deputy Minister Feng Quan to secure the frontier. Among them, Feng Quan was the most active. The following year, he went to Batang and was killed for handling military affairs. In the autumn of the thirty-second year, the Qing court established the Minister of Border Affairs of Sichuan and Yunnan in western Sichuan, with Zhao Erfeng as its head. After receiving the order, Zhao trained troops and reclaimed land, reformed the chieftain system, and managed the area with great vigor. In five years, he achieved remarkable results.</p>
<p>It is impossible to fully describe the history of Zhao Erfeng's management of western Sichuan in this article. However, the important fact is that since Zhao, western Sichuan has had a special status and has had various relations with Tibet. During the Zhao Erfeng era, he did not show any leniency towards the chieftains; nor did he show any leniency towards the separatism and arrogance of the lama temples. However, in positive aspects, he was able to operate with dedication and with public integrity and fairness, which did not give the Tibetans any grounds to complain. However, his successors after Zhao's death, from Bing Changheng onwards, such as Zhang Xu in the second year of the Republic of China, Liu Ruiheng in the third year of the Republic of China, Gu Chengxian in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and Chen Xieduan from the fifth to thirteenth years of the Republic of China, and Liu Chengdong from the thirteenth to sixteenth years of the Republic of China, consistently lacked the military might to deter the Tibetans, and their political achievements were often disorganized and bleak. They even allowed their soldiers to plunder the people and trample on the lamas, causing the Yellow Sect to despise the Han people and openly resist. As described by Liu Yiqing and others in "Expedition to Kham and Tibet" (Volume 30): "...The situation in Litang (i.e., Lihua) is very different from the outside world. There are no garrison soldiers within the territory, and the so-called officials are only two Han magistrates. The people suffered deeply from the soldiers' trampling in the past, so they aroused counterattacks and carried out self-defense movements. The stationed troops were forcibly stationed in the lama temples, using the lamas to demand things from the people. If they sent money or sent errands and slightly went against their will, they would declare that they would set fire to the temples and massacre the lamas. The scholars respected the lamas very much, and often endured humiliation to seek completeness. In the end, the accumulated resentment was too deep and suddenly broke out, and the soldiers were driven out of the country..." These undeniable realities gave the Tibetan side the opportunity to assist some anti-resistance forces in western Sichuan. Its most notable evolution was the case of the Ganzi Lamas, such as the Great Golden Temple, which has been troubling the area for nearly a decade since the 19th year of the Republic of China. In the past ten years or so, the Great Golden Temple case has occupied a decisive position in the Kham-Tibet issue. The two sides have engaged in fighting several times, and the disputes have been unresolved. On a small scale, it is only a struggle between one or two lama temples; on a large scale, it is the entire issue of western Sichuan against Tibet. If we expand it further, it can be said that it is a dispute containing serious international significance.</p>
<p>However, this major and complex dispute was completely resolved in Degge County on the second day of this month, the day after the establishment of the Xikang Provincial Government, with a spirit of mutual concessions and mutual understanding. The relationship between Kham and Tibet has ushered in a new era, which is undoubtedly of great significance, especially in today's more difficult war of resistance.</p>
<p>Now, let us report the whole story of the Great Golden Temple case.</p>
<p>II. From Temple Dispute to Kham-Tibetan Conflict</p>
<p>The Great Golden Temple is a famous large Lama Temple on the northern route of western Sichuan, located in Ganzi County, sixty li northwest of the county seat. The temple has more than two thousand lamas. Although the number of people is not as large as that of Ganzi Temple (Ganzi Temple has four thousand people), it has two major characteristics: First, the temple property is extremely large, controlling the northern route and trade with Tibet, and the income is the most abundant. It is said that the temple's cellar stores Bianzhuang silver, which can be used for the salaries of the entire Kham garrison for ten years; Second, it is directly connected to Tibet, connected to both sides of the Jinsha River through Dege. There are backers to rely on. Because of this, the lamas in the temple not only have money but also have power. On the one hand, they do everything possible to oppress other lamas; on the other hand, they act recklessly towards the Han Chinese government.</p>
<p>The beginning of the incident was very subtle, but after a complex evolution, it eventually led to a frontal confrontation between Kham and Tibet. Originally, the southeast neighbor of the Great Golden Temple was the jurisdiction of the Baili chieftain. There are three major lama temples in the territory: —— Baili Temple, Chunzhe Temple, and Yala Temple. A hundred years ago, Baili Temple was robbed by bandits. Later, with the help of the monks of Yala Temple, the bandits were driven back. The Baili chieftain, out of gratitude, allowed the monks of Yala Temple to jointly manage Baili Temple.</p>
<p>The problem occurred after the death of a Hukhan Ketu (abbot) of Yala Temple, who was "reincarnated" in the Ningchong Sangduo family, a Hutu Ketu in the Great Golden Temple, named Yala Guzi. His family had sent him to Lhasa to study, and after completing his studies, he solicited the favor of the Zili chieftain and brought him from the border of the Great Golden Temple to Baili to preside over Yala Temple. At the same time, he could naturally also manage Baili Temple. At that time, Baili Temple was dilapidated. Yala Guzi used his family wealth to renovate it and restore its old appearance. Just at this time, the old Baili chieftain died without a son, leaving only one daughter, who married the son of the Gacha chieftain. Later, she was driven away by the wife of the Gacha chieftain. After returning home, she gave birth to a son out of wedlock, and this son was made the successor to the Baihe chieftain.</p>
<p>Just as the Baili chieftain was weak, the Hutu Ketu of Chunpeng Temple, mentioned above, coveted the temple property and power of Yala Temple. He then bewitched the daughter of the Baili chieftain (i.e., the daughter-in-law of the Gacha chieftain who had been driven away) to drive out Yala Guzi. After Yala Guzi was forced to return to the Ningchong family in the Great Golden territory, he asked the Great Golden Temple to retaliate. The Great Golden Temple had always been unscrupulous, and getting this opportunity, it naturally "would not give way." As a result, a conflict occurred.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 19th year of the Republic of China, on a day for performing "Jumping Gods", the Great Golden Temple sent people to set fire to Yala Temple. Lamas consider burning a temple the greatest insult. So this time, it turned into a public outrage on the entire Baili side. The three major lama temples of Baili united to start a war with the Great Golden Temple; as a result, of course, the Baili side could not defeat the Great Golden Temple. It began to yield while appealing to the Ganzi County government to seek redress. The county government initially wanted to mediate fairly, but since the Great Golden Temple refused to accept it, it turned to the garrison (Liu Wenhui's troops) for military suppression. After the troops arrived, the Great Golden Temple knew that the matter had become a big mess, so it simply sought help from the Tibetan army of Rongba Cha on the bank of the Jinsha River. The Tibetan side aided it with a large amount of military fire, and later directly sent troops to fight against Baili and Liu Wenhui's troops. At this point, the dispute between the Great Golden Temple and Baili turned into a frontal conflict between Kham and Tibet.</p>
<p>III. From the Beginning of the War to the Armistice</p>
<p>The frontal clash between the two sides lasted about two months. (Spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China). Liu Wenhui telegraphed the central government for instructions. The central government believed that the matter was of great importance, so on March 29 of the 20th year, it sent Tang Ke to Kham to mediate. At the same time, it also asked the Dalai Lama to send someone to negotiate with Tang Ke. It also sent a telegram, sending Abu Ke to Ganzi to be responsible for mediation; who knew that Abu stayed in Qamdo for six months, and then the "September 18" Incident occurred. The Tibetan side took the opportunity to increasingly collude with the Great Golden Temple, and the reconciliation completely failed. Tang Ke returned without results. The Han and Tibetan armies then officially went to war on the east bank of the Jinsha River. After a whole year, the Tibetan army gradually became unable to sustain itself, and successively withdrew from Dege, Dengke Baiyu, and Shiqu, all the way to the west of the Jinsha River. At the same time, it sent personnel to sign a ceasefire agreement with Liu's army in Ada, a subordinate of Dege, on the east bank of the Jinsha River. These conditions, due to various reasons in the past, have not been published. Now that the incident has ended, it may be disclosed. The full text is as follows: [To be continued]</p>

<h3 id="e18">Chamberlain's Broadcast: Preparing to Resist Aggression, Emphasizing the Threat of Air Raids, and Appealing for People to Enlist <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Chamberlain</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a broadcast speech today, initiating the British government's campaign to enlist volunteers for various national defense departments. He stated that, in the opinion of government officials, a national voluntary service system is essential. "This system is to prepare us for war. This does not mean that I believe war is imminent. You all know that I have done my best to maintain peace and will continue to do so. We will never initiate a war, but we may have to participate in a war initiated by other countries. If other countries believe that we cannot defend ourselves, then we may be attacked. The more prepared we are for self-defense and resistance to aggression, the less dare aggressors take risks, as their chances of success are very small." Chamberlain emphasized that modern warfare is different from past wars. "The development of modern air forces has made our homeland unsafe. The victims of air raids are not only soldiers, sailors, and pilots, but also civilians. Civilians may be the first to suffer. This is true in our country and also in continental Europe. Therefore, if we want to protect civilians in wartime, we must conduct necessary organization in peacetime, and we must train in peacetime, as there will be no time for training after the war begins. Therefore, our plan is preventive in nature, and its importance is no less than battleships, artillery, and aircraft. However, this does not mean that the god of war is about to descend. I hope you will all carefully read the handbook issued by the government, as what is discussed in it is related to all of you. In the handbook, you will understand how to ensure public safety and how to serve after the war breaks out." Chamberlain asked citizens who have not participated in major national defense work to quickly choose the work they are most competent for and receive the necessary training. He concluded by saying that some people believe that this voluntary registration system is not very effective and that a compulsory registration system would be more effective. "However, compulsory registration is not in line with our democratic system and tradition of freedom. We firmly believe that we do not need compulsory methods to obtain all the national defense personnel we need. You have always asked how you can serve the country. This government proposal can give you the opportunity to show the world that free people are preparing to defend their freedom and ideals. I firmly believe that my request will receive your full response."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] As the national military service campaign has begun, the British air defense authorities issued a notice yesterday, urging people from all walks of life to actively join the air defense forces. Nationals over the age of 25 can report for participation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] After Anderson, the British Minister of Civilian Protection, launched the national service campaign, the Home Office immediately issued a notice, asking local authorities to quickly recruit volunteers for air defense. The notice mentioned that a list of temporarily exempt occupations will be promulgated, stating that only those over the age of 29 can be exempted, and those under the age of 25 can still join the air defense service. Also, those over the age of 25 whose occupations are on the list of temporary exemptions may be allowed to participate in their spare time if they volunteer.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 24th] Group Captain Mack, who has served in the British Air Force for 25 years, resigned yesterday in protest of the inadequacy of British air defense. Mack has represented Britain at the Geneva Disarmament Conference in the past two years. According to Mack, when war was likely to break out last September, military organization and training of the air force were inadequate, but this situation has not been remedied to this day. Therefore, he resigned to draw the attention of Parliament and the people to the inadequacy of British air force policy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] Australian Foreign Minister Hughes said in a radio speech here a few days ago that if countries want to avoid war and Australia wants to save itself, they should take action immediately. The threat of dictatorial countries in the Far East to Australia is becoming increasingly urgent. If Australia does not prepare immediately, it will be doomed. Australia should now move rapidly towards war preparation, leaving everything else behind. Certain countries are setting fires everywhere. Can Australia take warning?</p>
<h3 id="e19">Italy Calls Up Reservists: Anticipating a New European Crisis; Eden's Speech Expresses Concern Over the Spanish War, Advocating a Firm Stance by Britain and France <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 23rd] According to reports from Italy and abroad, thousands of reservists, or even the entire population born in 1901, will be mobilized to prepare for the world crisis after the end of the Spanish War. According to an officer of that grade, he has received a general mobilization notice, and he believes that the people of that grade will be fully mobilized, except for the Guards and Carabinieri. This move will allow the Italian army to immediately increase from 300,000 to 500,000 men.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech yesterday, expressing concern about the Spanish war situation. He believes that in the current situation, the most effective way for Britain and France to cooperate for peace is to express their determination to protect the Mediterranean and other interests.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Corwen, Warwickshire, England, 23rd] Former Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech, expressing dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy towards Italy. He said that if Britain and France can maintain their national interests with an indomitable and resolute attitude, it will make a great contribution to the peaceful situation. As far as the Spanish issue is concerned, the interests that Britain and France have in Spain are vital to survival. The political independence and territorial integrity of Spain must be respected. How the fate of the country is decided should not be determined by one or several countries. The Nationalist troops are attacking Barcelona with powerful artillery and air force. Who supplies these weapons is already known to everyone. Those who supply this military equipment have willingly signed agreements accepting the restraint of non-intervention, and are still openly violating the agreements they have signed. Foreign volunteers belonging to the Spanish government army have all withdrawn, but the bombers of the Nationalist side are foreign pilots, the artillerymen who fire the guns are foreign artillerymen, and the infantry who roam the territory are foreign infantry. If the Nationalist army wins, it is no different from saying that a foreign country has won. At this moment, it is certain that a certain country, on the one hand, declares non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, and on the other hand, provides full assistance to the Spanish Nationalist army, so that it can win the final victory, and is not satisfied with this. It announces to us that if France dares to intervene in the Spanish civil war, its attitude will be reconsidered by those countries, regardless of their size. How can we establish friendship on the basis of such tacit conditions?</p>
<h3 id="e20">French Political Circles: Extremely Uneasy <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd] As the Nationalist army advances rapidly, France is extremely uneasy. Political figures firmly believe that as soon as the Spanish civil war ends, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will formally make various demands to France, refuse to fulfill his promises, and continue to station troops in the Spanish mainland and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean to threaten France. The French government hopes that Prime Minister Mussolini's guarantee not to covet Spanish territory will remain effective and does not intend to take any action. However, if Italian troops do not withdraw from the Spanish Balearic Islands, France will also have the right to send troops to Spanish Morocco in Africa and other places. Regarding this, The Times, which has always been known for its moderation, has also expressed its approval, which is quite noteworthy. The newspaper also advocated that the French government should send commercial representatives to the city of Burgos, where the Spanish Nationalist government is located, and consult with Germany in accordance with the Franco-German Peace Declaration of December 6 last year to avoid a tense situation that would force France to take action. Ribbentrop's visit to Poland will discuss this.</p>

It is also widely believed that this visit is to provide Hitler with information for his speech in Congress on the 30th.</p>

In addition, the German government has recently promulgated several military orders, concentrating all power in the National Socialist Party, which must be paid attention to. According to rumors, the German army will partially mobilize in the middle of next month. After the end of the Spanish Civil War, Germany and Italy will raise the entire issue of colonies. Upon hearing this, the British side commented extensively, saying that French Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to deliver a speech to the French National Assembly tomorrow, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech in Birmingham on the 28th of this month, explaining where the "British line of resistance" lies. German leader Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech on the 30th of this month, the sixth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. The international situation will be revealed at that time.</p>

The cabinet meeting also decided to implement a state of war in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Spanish government, stipulating that all resources are to be controlled by the Ministry of National Defense and military authorities. Yesterday, the bars, cafes, and privately owned restaurants in Barcelona were all closed. Hotels are still open as usual, but only military personnel and refugees in transit are allowed to live in them. Rebel planes continue to bomb.</p>

<p>A Short Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e27">"Frugal Virtues Banquet" and the Old New Year <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The national crisis is so serious that all viable and non-viable forces in the country should concentrate on contributing to the cause of national reconstruction, so all daily life and social entertainment expenses should be reduced to the minimum. Enduring personal temporary hardship, seeking a hundred generations of happiness for descendants, and seeking eternal freedom for the nation are all essential in terms of sentiment and handling.</p>
<p>According to a special dispatch from this newspaper's Chongqing branch on the 24th, "The Chongqing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has decided that each table of banquets should not exceed eight yuan, six dishes and one soup, called the 'Frugal Virtues Banquet'. Violators will be punished." This move is indeed worthy of being advocated throughout the country, especially the two words "Frugal Virtues," which seem to be more meaningful than "thrift."</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year is approaching. According to social customs, we have worked hard all year round, and it is not too much to have fun at this time. However, looking back at the motherland, where the flames of war are everywhere, and looking around, where refugees are like ants, no one with a heart will not be moved by it. Therefore, although we dare not hope that all sectors of the Hong Kong community will unanimously implement the "Frugal Virtues Banquet" movement, we hope that all industries can donate one day of charity sales to help war-torn refugees. We also hope that all relevant groups will expand fundraising campaigns and actively promote the work of rescuing refugees and assisting in ××. The one-still motion should be developed into a glorious competition. Compatriots in the motherland, who have suffered severely from the trampling and shelling of the ×× iron cavalry, are still striving hard and practicing frugal virtues; front-line soldiers are fighting for national liberation and bloody resistance, and the more they fight, the more vigorous they become; our overseas compatriots, who live overseas, so those who repay the country and seek peace of mind, first and foremost donate generously—we hope that readers will take the lead, spread the word, so that they can be without shame in front of friends from other countries!</p>
<h3 id="e28">World Youth Help Us Resist Japan <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>At the Second World Youth Peace Conference held at Warsaw Women's University in New York, the representatives of more than 50 countries participating in the conference unanimously passed the resolution to support our country's war of resistance against Japan, resolving to (1) stop transporting military supplies and kerosene to support the Japanese troops and refuse to lend money to Japan, (2) governments of all countries should implement boycotts of Japanese goods; (3) the people of all countries should earnestly expand the boycott of Japanese goods movement and encourage the purchase of Chinese goods; (4) the international community should guarantee loans to China to help China enrich its national defense and promote internal construction. This proves that the youth all over the world sympathize and protect our opposition to the Japanese fascist aggression, and also proves that our war of resistance against Japan is also maintaining the meaning of world peace, which has been recognized by the youth all over the world. However, we must infinitely expand this international assistance into an invincible force to sanction Japanese and German-Italian fascist aggressors. That requires our current efforts and achievements are clearly not enough—we must redouble our efforts to improve and develop the unified front of the country's youth itself, and at the same time redouble our efforts to promote the unified front of the world's youth against fascism and anti-aggression. Young students in Hong Kong should also recognize their great mission in the current emergency stage, carry forward the achievements of the past, and redouble their efforts to temper themselves, educate the masses, and expand the united front from the theoretical struggle and the work of national salvation.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Romania Under the Gaze of the National Socialist Party (Continued) <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Romania is one of the countries in the Balkan Peninsula, and its fate is intertwined with that of other countries. In the past, the Little Entente included Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, but it has now effectively ceased to exist. Another Balkan alliance has emerged, including Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. Romania's southern neighbor, Bulgaria, is not included due to its similar situation with Hungary, but it is surrounded by them.</p>
<p>After the Munich Agreement, the King of Romania and the King of Greece, as well as the Regent of Yugoslavia, visited England one after another. The chiefs of staff of the Balkan Alliance countries met in Athens to jointly plan for self-defense. They put forward the slogan "The Balkans belong to the Balkan countries" to oppose external forces' intrusion and advocated for actively and practically resolving disputes over minority issues.</p>
<p>On July 31, they signed a non-aggression treaty with Bulgaria in Thessaloniki, allowing Bulgaria to rearm. France also provided Bulgaria with a large loan and increased commercial relations, which can be seen as a symbol of Bulgaria's anti-fascism. In August, the Balkan countries met in Bled and agreed to Hungary's rearmament, aiming to adjust the relationships among the Balkan countries themselves and resist fascist aggression.</p>
<p>Recently, King George of Greece, in a conversation with Mr. Madol, a reporter for the Sunday Referee in London, stated: "We people of the Balkan Peninsula have today set an example for the world. We have resolved our mutual disputes in an absolutely peaceful manner. Now, all countries understand that there are no fortifications between Greece and Turkey. During the European crisis in September, the Balkan countries were united and prepared for war. We have become a nation of 70 million people, with 5 million soldiers ready to go to the front line."</p>
<p>British Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill recently discussed the future of the Balkan Peninsula countries in an article titled "Dangers in Eastern Europe," stating that although Poland obtained the German city of Teschen from Czechoslovakia, Hitler would demand a price for it. The target of the so-called Greater Ukraine independence movement in Poland is Danzig and the corridor area. The Soviet Union may not stand idly by. The reason Foreign Minister Beck was eager to sign a new Soviet-Polish agreement was for this very reason.</p>
<p>After the Munich Agreement, Eastern European countries were surrounded by dangers and were like startled birds. Among the independent and peaceful countries, it is hard to say who will become Hitler's next victim.</p>
<p>Romania's situation is very tense, but the recent meeting between the King of England and Carol gave London a good impression. They felt that he was very talented and capable of navigating dangers. However, with Romania possessing oil and grain, and with domestic minorities and neighboring Hungary waiting for revenge, the country's fate is always precarious.</p>
<p>These two threatened countries are fortunate to be adjacent to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's contributions in the Far East have already earned the admiration of Britain and the United States. How it will respond in Europe is certainly worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Post-war Turkey has become a force to be reckoned with. Greece and Turkey are very friendly, and the relationship between both countries and England has never been strained. England lent Turkey a 6 million pound loan this year, which greatly helped Turkey and earned a lot of goodwill. The King of Greece has lived in England for many years and is intelligent and decisive, capable of cooperating with England. The union of these three countries has a good influence on Bulgaria. Since the Thessaloniki Conference, it has rejoined the group of Balkan countries, which is a concrete expression of this.</p>
<p>"If these countries can unite and form an armed fortress of peace, national prosperity and peace will not be a problem. Otherwise, they will be individually defeated by Germany. If they allow the spread of fascist heresies within their countries, then great disaster will befall them."</p>
<p>Therefore, Romania has only two paths before it: surrender or resistance. After the partition of Czechoslovakia, Romania is in the same position as Hungary after Germany annexed Austria. Under the direct pressure of the National Socialist Party's forces, it is objectively no longer allowed to ride two horses and simultaneously maneuver between two forces. It is the last barrier to the aggressor's eastward advance and the last gateway to the treasure trove of the Near East for Britain and France. The gain or loss of Romania is of decisive significance to the success or failure of Hitler's ambitions. The first path is very simple, and the result is also obvious. After surrendering, Germany will obtain its resources, especially the oil needed for modern mechanized weapons. Regardless of whether Carol's throne can be maintained, Romania will be monopolized by Hitler's lackeys, such as the Iron Guard and the German Party, and will serve as a vanguard for the National Socialist Party's eastward expedition and become its sacrifice,沦落 to a battlefield for a European war.</p>
<p>Resistance is the more likely alternative. This is the common direction unanimously advocated by the entire country, except for the National Socialist Party's lackeys. Based on various advantageous objective conditions in the international arena, Hitler, though powerful, is not enough to fight as long as an international united front against fascism is established.</p>
<p>Romania's fate hinges on domestic unity, unwavering determination, and the completion of an international united front against fascism in Europe. As Litvinov said, "Peace is indivisible." Only under a collective security system can Romania have a bright future. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Li Zhengyao Returns from Attending the Youth Congress, Discusses the World's Youth's Commitment to Aid China and Resist Japan, International Figures Express Warm Sympathy for Our Heroic Resistance Against Japan, Representatives from Forty-Seven Countries Sign the Warsaw Pact Against Aggression <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Exclusive Interview with Our Newspaper</p>
<p>Bring the fire of our heroic resistance to the world, bring back the noble sympathy from the international community—Li Zhengyao, the Hong Kong student representative who attended the Second World Youth Peace Congress, returned to Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<p>Representative Li hosted a reception for reporters at the Astor Hotel yesterday at 3:00 PM to report on everything. To express their admiration, guests enthusiastically attended the meeting. Before the meeting, guests crowded together to view the many photos brought by Representative Li. The photos of the atrocities committed by the Japanese aroused our infinite hatred, the heroic resistance of our army aroused our infinite admiration, and the international sympathy aroused our infinite excitement.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Representative Li first gave a speech, followed by Feng Yufang, a design committee member of the Military Affairs Commission's Political Department, who spoke on the importance of national diplomacy. Next, the representative of the Youth Journalists Association expressed their respect and appreciation to Representative Li. Finally, the representative of the Student Federation reported on the general situation of the association. The meeting ended happily around 5:00 PM. The following is a summary of several important matters reported:</p>
<p>The World's Youth Sympathize with Our Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>Before the meeting, in order to understand the international anti-aggression trends, our newspaper reporter specifically raised several questions to Representative Li. Mr. Li patiently answered, and with his calm and gentle attitude, delivered a speech that was infinitely inspiring. The Second World Youth Peace Congress fully sympathized with our country's heroic resistance against Japan and unanimously opposed the Japanese fascists' aggression. The atmosphere was very tense. Overseas Chinese in New York lit fireworks at the congress, projecting our national flag, a portrait of Chairman Chiang, and the words "Long Live the Republic of China," which won the enthusiastic sympathy and respect of international friends present.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Italy did not have a representative present, but Germany had a representative from a certain group. However, he sympathized with the peace front and opposed his own government's aggressive actions. Japan, on the other hand, actually had five youth representatives of certain groups participating. When the congress unanimously sympathized with our country and condemned Japan, these Japanese military阀 also tried to "argue and defend," but under the universal contempt and ridicule, they had no choice but to bow their heads in dejection before the truth.</p>
<p>The Japanese are quite conspiratorial in the United States, engaging in reactionary propaganda to distort right and wrong. A small number of missionaries have also been bought off, receiving US$250 per propaganda campaign for the Japanese military阀. When Guangzhou fell, it was even more of an opportunity for them to spread rumors and slander. However, because of the solemn attitude of the major American newspapers, intelligent people can distinguish between good and bad, and the Japanese's efforts are only futile.</p>
<p>Signing the Warsaw Pact to Oppose Aggressors</p>
<p>The greatest achievement of the congress was the signing of the historically valuable "Warsaw Peace Pact," the full text of which is attached. This is not just a document; the youth of European and American countries are working hard to make it a reality, such as boycotting Japanese goods, urging their own governments not to assist Japan, helping China with relief efforts, assisting students and refugees in our war zones, and expanding anti-aggression propaganda, all of which are spreading like wildfire. Several groups in various countries are specifically responsible for promoting this movement to resist Japan and aid China. The most active are the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Universities in the United Kingdom and the United States are holding competitions to donate funds to help China, and large sums of money have been flowing into China. The American Student Association also donated forty Red Cross vehicles to China during Christmas. European countries are also imitating and promoting this. The four representatives of the World Student Federation who came to China have been touring the United States, accepting invitations to report on our country's heroic resistance against Japan and giving lectures for more than two months, and have not yet finished. One of the British representatives, Mr. Chuan Lude, repeatedly postponed his wedding date to do his best to promote our country. Since then, international friends have become increasingly hateful of the Japanese and sympathetic to our country.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese and pro-China propaganda materials from various countries are ubiquitous, and what is commonly found in every corner is a card with the following words: "I don't buy Japanese goods because I don't want to buy bombs for Japan to brutally kill the Chinese people."</p>
<p>The power of this international propaganda is very great. Merchants in various countries refuse to sell Japanese goods, and workers strike against transporting Japanese goods, which is becoming a popular trend.</p>
<p>—Representative Li's conversation with the reporter was truly inspiring. As international sympathy becomes more active, we feel that we should work harder. Darkness will not forever obscure the light, and justice will not forever succumb to power. As long as we persevere in our resistance against Japan, we will surely achieve final victory. Representative Li's return from Europe and the United States has brought us one more true piece of evidence that we will win the war.</p>
<p>Representative Li Addresses the Press</p>
<p>Representative Li delivered a speech to all the guests at the meeting. The following is a summary of the original speech:</p>
<p>Brothers, I have observed that people in European and American countries have expressed warm sympathy for our resistance against Japan and have provided various practical assistance, such as donating funds to relieve refugees, boycotting Japanese goods, and stopping the transportation of military equipment and raw materials to Japan. Both the government and the people are enthusiastically participating in these movements. As for overseas Chinese around the world, they are also working very hard for the national salvation movement. Those with money are certainly contributing money, and even the working masses are actively donating and are not willing to lag behind. For example, many overseas Chinese who work as laundry workers earn barely enough to make a living, but they still save money in hardship and donate every day, long-term donations. This spirit of hard work and struggle is truly inspiring. But there is one point that we must pay attention to, and that is that international propaganda work is still insufficient. In the future, we must expand propaganda on military, political, and other aspects to overseas Chinese to strengthen their understanding of the motherland's resistance against Japan, strengthen their faith, and correct the Japanese's counter-propaganda abroad. For example, during the recent Guangdong war situation, the Japanese created various counter-propaganda abroad.</p>
<p>The result of this conference, that is, the signing of the Warsaw Peace Pact by representatives of forty-seven youth groups, made everyone feel infinitely excited. After the conference, my brothers saw that the young students of various countries were actively implementing the provisions of the pact, and my brothers felt even more gratified. I deeply hope that the young students in Hong Kong and patriotic overseas Chinese will promote this pact with the greatest effort, strive for world peace, and work hard for the motherland's resistance against Japan. My brothers have come abroad this time and are responsible for the task of contacting young people from all over the world. When I went to the United Kingdom and France, I contacted youth groups in various places to discuss methods of mutual contact, and the results were quite satisfactory. In particular, I hope that young students in Hong Kong will work together to maintain world peace, etc.</p>
<p>Written Report Recounts Congress Proceedings</p>
<p>Representative Li issued a written report, the following is a summary: (1) Origin of the World Youth Peace Congress: In 1936, the United Nations Associations and Federations of various countries, in order to promote world peace, sanction aggression, and unite young people from all over the world regardless of race, religion, or political party, to jointly enhance friendship, communicate opinions, and resolve world disputes, specially convened the First World Youth Peace Congress in Geneva. More than 750 representatives from more than 40 countries attended. After the opening of the congress, youth federations were established in 28 countries, and they maintained constant contact, communicated, and advanced and retreated together in the past two years. The Second Congress was held from August 16 to 24 last year at the Warsaw Women's University (New York, USA). The congress discussed matters in four sections: politics, economics, religion, and education. More than 700 representatives from 56 countries attended, and more than 23,000 people visited.</p>
<p>(2) The Chinese Delegation and the Second Congress: The youth of our country have always been a model for the world's youth in the national liberation movement and the struggle against aggression. China sent more than ten people, including Chen Zhutian and Lu Cui, to participate in the first congress. At that time, the sacred resistance war was launched, and the Chinese representatives had a great influence in the conference hall. This year, at the Second Congress, our country, in view of the importance of expanding international propaganda, winning international sympathy and assistance, and jointly sanctioning the Japanese invasion, organized a Chinese delegation to attend the congress. Now, because the mission has been completed, and the Hong Kong student relief association affairs are waiting to be handled, and the school leave has expired, I am rushing to return to the country first. Most of the representatives are still in the western and eastern United States, the United Kingdom, France, etc., staying to continue their propaganda.</p>
<p>Congress Resolution Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>(4) Congress Resolutions: This congress made many resolutions, among which the Warsaw Pact and the following points are the most important:</p>
<p>1.  Stop transporting military supplies and kerosene to supply Japan, and refuse to lend money to Japan.</p>
<p>2.  Governments of all countries should implement a boycott of Japanese goods</p>
<p>3.  The people of all countries should earnestly expand the boycott of Japanese goods movement and promote the purchase of Chinese goods.</p>
<p>4.  International guarantee loan to China to assist China in strengthening national defense and promoting internal construction.</p>
<p>Our country's delegation, led by consultants Zhang Bohu, Zhang Pengchun, Meng Zhi, and head Yang Fuyou, participated in the full group discussions and contacted representatives from various countries, and the results were very satisfactory. The most gratifying thing is that all the representatives sympathize with our country's resistance against Japan (omitted below)</p>
<p>Warsaw Peace Pact Forty-Four Participants</p>
<p>The Warsaw Peace Pact is the culmination of this congress, the full text of which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Article 1: We pledge to promote the spirit of friendship and cooperation among young people of all countries, to work hard to help the young people of our own countries, to unite closely, and to unite with the young people of other countries, regardless of race, creed, or political views, so that they may be united under the leadership of the World Youth Congress movement.</p>
<p>Article 2: We strictly condemn any war of aggression that violates the political independence or territorial sovereignty of another country.</p>
<p>Article 3: We pledge to do everything in our power to ensure that the young people in our country do not participate in wars of aggression against other countries.</p>
<p>Article 4: We agree that when the circumstances require it, we will do our best to urge our national authorities to take joint action with other countries to prevent aggression, to stop aggression that has already occurred, and to provide effective assistance to countries that are damaged by treaties and endangered by aggression. And to ensure that our country does not participate in any aggression, regardless of the form of participation, whether it is supplying the aggressor with war materials or financial assistance, it must be avoided.</p>
<p>Article 5: We solemnly declare that the bombing of undefended cities and civilians is a violation of humanity and internationally accepted rules. We will actively mobilize world opinion to condemn this behavior and assist in the relief efforts for the evacuated.</p>
<p>Article 6: We believe that if justice and fairness are not established internationally and within each country, and if the right to self-determination of some countries and colonies that are seeking freedom is not recognized, there will be no lasting peace. Therefore, we will use peaceful means to correct the unfair phenomena against the people of all countries, regardless of their race, creed, or political views. In our view, political and social justice within our own country, and promote the immediate establishment of international institutions to resolve international disputes by peaceful means.</p>
<p>Signatories include representatives from 47 countries: the United States, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Ecuador, Ireland, Ethiopia, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Haiti, the Netherlands, India, the Dutch East Indies, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Liberia, Nicaragua, Lithuania, Poland, Palestine, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Honduras, Romania, El Salvador, South Africa, the Gold Coast of West Africa, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Uganda, Uruguay, the West Indies (US), Yugoslavia, etc.</p>

<p>According to passengers on the French mail ship Félix Roussel, which arrived in Hong Kong from Europe yesterday, a Japanese passenger was arrested by local government officials in Saigon just before the ship set sail for Hong Kong. It is said that the Japanese man had been living there, and his arrest was due to suspicion of espionage.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Local Discovery of Epidemic Paralysis; No Treatment Equipment Other Than "Iron Lung" <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Recently, epidemic paralysis has been discovered in Hong Kong. Two officers of the Hong Kong warship HMS Grampus have contracted the disease in just a few days. Captain Waster of the warship has already been sent to the naval hospital due to paralysis, and his condition is quite serious. Another crew member has also contracted the disease, but his condition is less severe. The number of people in Hong Kong who have epidemic paralysis still needs to be statistically determined after the incubation period of the disease has passed. The commander of the Grampus is currently staying temporarily in the naval hospital, and the crew members have been sent to live in the naval dockyard. They have access to games and entertainment, but cannot contact the outside world to prevent infection. After the dangerous period has passed, they will be able to resume activities. It is known that the most effective treatment equipment for paralysis is the "iron lung." A week ago, the Hong Kong government had already telegraphed the agent of Lord Nuffield of Oxford, requesting the donation of one "iron lung" each for adults and children. However, before receiving the "iron lungs," Hong Kong has no equipment to treat paralysis.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Japanese Planes Bombing Frequently, Disaster Situation Severe in Various Parts of Guangxi; Guangxi Authorities Request Hong Kong Overseas Chinese to Assist in Relief; Women's Comfort Association Resolves to Donate 5,000 First and Find Ways to Raise Funds; Relief Federation General Assembly Did Not Discuss Relief for Guangxi Yesterday <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, yesterday urgently requested the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association to find ways to help due to the frequent bombing of Guangxi by Japanese planes and the severe disaster situation, and also asked to appeal to various related organizations to jointly launch a righteous act. According to Chairman Huang's report, (1) Japanese planes have bombed 16 counties in the province, totaling more than 50 times, burning down homes and leaving many people homeless and unable to make a living; (2) Refugees entering the province from outside the province have no houses to live in, no way to make a living, and many are displaced; (3) The number of elderly, weak, disabled refugees and orphans in and out of the province is also quite large. Because the provincial treasury has limited financial resources, it has not been able to handle all of the above properly. In addition to previously establishing provincial relief branches to preside over the mobilization of relief matters throughout the province, it has also designated counties in the province's inland water and land transportation areas and along the borders of Hunan and Guangdong provinces to organize relief branches, and the branches have formulated various regulations and measures for relieving refugees in this province and promulgated and implemented them one after another. Recently, it plans to carry out the following matters: (1) It plans to first select sites in counties along the Guiliu Road to build 1,000 temporary simple houses for refugees; (2) Distribute or lend small amounts of money to refugees to enable them to make a living; (3) Build and set up 10 sanatoriums for 100 refugees each in Guilin, Liuzhou, and Xuanshan; (4) Select sites to build and set up 10 orphanages for 100 refugees each; (5) Select sites to build refugee factories 10 factories; (6) Plan to select sites to carry out refugee reclamation projects, setting up 10 refugee reclamation offices. The funds required amount to hundreds of thousands or more. In terms of the current economic situation in the province, it is difficult to carry out all of them. It is hoped that Hong Kong organizations will donate funds to assist in handling them, or directly send personnel to Guangxi to take charge, and the provincial government will provide as much assistance as possible, which is all welcome. Based on this, the Women's Comfort Association immediately submitted it to the standing committee meeting yesterday morning for discussion and decided to donate 5,000 national currency first to help with the urgent needs, and also requested assistance from the Relief Federation, the British Relief Association, and other charitable organizations. In addition, the association also discussed and planned to raise funds for the refugees in Guangxi, and the measures are being planned and will be decided in the near future.</p>
<p>Also, the Hong Kong Joint Relief Association for Refugees in South China held its 32nd member meeting yesterday at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. More than 30 people, including Chairman Zhou Xingchi, attended the meeting and resolved the following proposals: (1) The General Affairs Group requested a donation to the Shanghai Youth Association's Boy Scouts Military Service Corps for a rescue vehicle or two motorcycles. It was decided that when the group sends a letter next time stating what kind of vehicle is needed, it will be discussed again. However, the appropriation is limited to 3,500 yuan or less. (2) Liang Baoren, the magistrate of Baoan County, telegraphed the General Assembly to send representatives to attend the land force rehabilitation meeting to be held in Shenzhen. It was decided to send Lin Peisheng as a representative to attend. It was decided to pass. (3) The Guangxi Emergency Refugee Relief Committee requested an appropriation for relief. It was decided that it would be discussed again when a formal official letter of request was received. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 p.m. A pontoon bridge after the destruction of Huibo Bian.

<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>Feature</p>
<p>The villages along the river connected to Boluo Wei (博羅威) belong to Baizu Ridge (百足嶺). The Xishuiwei (水西尾) area belonging to Hui (惠) was severely burned and devastated, with each village losing 70-80% of its population. Fortunately, up to this point, the area from Xishuiwei to the west of Baizu Ridge remains unharmed. Therefore, during this section of the water journey, one can still lean on the railing and gaze at the sugarcane fields and green fields, a natural and beautiful rural landscape. Although the devilish hands of the × people are many, they will never be able to seize our seven lands. That can always be believed.</p>
<p>Su Village (蘇村), the east bank, and Qiaotou (橋頭) are three market towns located in the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River, standing like a tripod. Fortunately, this time, the × people's invasion of South China, after landing in Huizhou (惠州), focused entirely on land routes, developing along highways or railways. Therefore, although the river route from Huizhou to Shilong (石龍) fell within the enemy's encirclement, only a small number of × soldiers passed through once, managing to avoid the ravages of the × people. At the same time, the × army now entrenched in Shilong (石龍) only disturbs the eastern region. The distance between Dongchuan (東傳) and Dongbo (東博) and these three market towns is still more than twenty li, and they dare not be rampant again amidst our counter-offensive. Therefore, this area can currently be called a paradise. However, we must rebuild this secluded paradise into the vanguard of the Dongjiang River.</p>
<p>Su Village (蘇村) belongs to the third district of Boluo (博羅) and faces Guanghe Market (廣和墟) in Huiyang (惠陽) across the river. The entire market town has just over a hundred shops and is not very large. Before the war, there was a battalion of troops stationed here. For the convenience of transportation, a pontoon bridge was built to connect to Guanghe (廣和) on the other side. When Huizhou (惠州) fell, more than ten × cavalrymen marched straight to Guanghe (廣和) from Jiazi Bu (甲子步) along the Jia-Guang Highway (甲廣公路). The defending troops of Su Village (蘇村) broke the bridge to resist. When the × people realized they could not cross, they returned disappointed, and the Su Village (蘇村) area was preserved. According to the locals, when the × cavalry passed the source of the Guangzhou River (廣州的源頭), two villagers stood by the highway to watch, astonished by the uniqueness of their clothing. They asked if they were the Central Army or ×××. One was beheaded by them, and the other fled into the sugarcane fields. From this anecdote, we deeply feel the inadequacy of political propaganda work in Chinese rural villages. Now, the commercial scene in Su Village (蘇村) is gradually returning to its former state, but the work of administrative self-defense is still far from ideal. This is a problem with the entire structure. It shows that past political reforms in China were only superficial, official bureaucratic exercises. Whether it's the Baojia (保甲) system or other systems, the foundation is still weak. A slight blow makes it difficult to recover. This deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Ten more li downriver from Su Village (蘇村) is Dong'an (東岸), similar in scale to Su Village (蘇村). Because it was not affected by artillery fire, the streets and shops in the market town are still intact. However, due to the rampant banditry and obstructed transportation, business has been much slower. According to the locals, there are four or five incidents of robbery by bandits between Su Village (蘇村) and Dong'an (東岸), at Hejing (何經) and Chilingxia (赤嶺下). When boats pass by, they fire shots to stop them, rob them clean, and then leave howling. Merchants, although rich in the spirit of adventure, are afraid that they will not easily venture out for trade if they have to take multiple risks. However, we didn't see any activity when we came. Perhaps they have already hidden themselves. Afterwards, the reporter met with a local chief there and talked about this situation, offering an idea of joint defense. Like the Xijiang River (西江), the river channel would be divided into several sections, and each section would be defended by nearby villages. He gladly adopted it. On the way back, we met the newly appointed Su Village (蘇村) patrol officer, Chen Boliang (陳伯良), and offered the same suggestion, which he also agreed with. The reporter always hopes that there will be a day when it will be realized. In fact, news from the front and the rear is related. If the rear has three disadvantages, the front will be weakened by one point.</p>
<p>Downriver from Dong'an (東岸) is Tiejiang (鐵江), but due to various difficulties in escorting, we could not go any further. We had to look at it from afar from the riverside of Dong'an (東岸). The vast misty waters and rolling cloud mountains depict the beautiful mountains and rivers of China, and the elegant posture of the Dongjiang River. I still remember that after the enemy occupied Huizhou (惠州), they sent six or seven hundred people downriver by boat, of which two or three hundred were wiped out by the Dongguan (東莞) self-defense corps on the Tiejiang River (鐵江江面). This glorious battle is worth recording, but it is a pity that the reporter could not personally linger there, which is a bit regrettable.</p>
<p>Qiaotou (橋頭) belongs to Dongguan County (東莞縣). To go from Dong'an (東岸), you have to cross the Dongjiang River and then cross a Shahe River (沙河). The locals call it Little Hong Kong (小香港). Although it may be an exaggeration, the market is indeed quite prosperous. The characteristics of a city, such as brothels, teahouses, women's lounges, opium dens, entertainment, and casinos, are mostly available. From here, you can go to Hong Kong via Changping Station (長平站). There are business groups organized and collected by Daji Liu (大鷄六) escorting goods, charging about two yuan per dan of goods for escort fees. Therefore, Qiaotou (橋頭) has now become the main import and export point and economic center of the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River. In this time of national crisis, a hero from the grassroots should, of course, join the fighting ranks. Those who are middle-of-the-road should also protect merchants and maintain local order. Daji Liu (大鷄六) still seems to be a middle-of-the-road figure. At the same time, it should be particularly praised that there are fewer bandits in Dongguan County (東莞縣), which is considered an advantage. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Hainan Island <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan (黃警頑)</p>
<p>Hainan Island, China's largest island, formerly known as Qiongya Island (瓊崖島), belongs to Guangdong Province. Originally, Hainan Island was not qualified to receive this honor - China's largest island - because although most of the many islands along China's coast are small in area, the famous sugar-producing Taiwan Island (台灣), opposite Fujian Province, is much larger than it. Unfortunately, this elder brother island was ceded to Japan by the Qing government long ago, so this younger brother is qualified to seize his brother's leading position. Today, it stands alone in the South China Sea. To know what its situation is, I will now observe it from four aspects. Observing Hainan Island from a political perspective.</p>
<p>Observing Hainan Island from a political perspective.</p>
<p>Hainan Island was anciently known as Baiyue (百越). It was not until Qin (秦) pacified Nanyue (南越) that it was included under the jurisdiction of Xiang County (象郡). In the Han Dynasty (漢時), Er'er (耳) and Zhuya (珠崖) counties were established. In the Jin Dynasty (晉時), it belonged to Taipu County (台浦郡). At that time, disaster refugees moved south in droves and drifted to Hainan Island, which was the beginning of our country's immigration to Hainan Island. By the Tang (唐) and Song (宋) dynasties, it had become a sacred place for famous scholars to be exiled. Those who have read Chinese history must know that Su Dongpo (蘇東坡) of the Song Dynasty (宋朝) was exiled to Wanzhou (萬州), and Li Deyu (李德裕) of the Tang Dynasty (唐朝) was demoted to Anzhou (岸州)... But this large island has a lot of fog and rain, the climate is extremely humid, and transportation is inconvenient. Of course, commerce is not developed. Therefore, in the eyes of the general public, it is regarded with the wrong concept of "barren and evil land." Not only was it like this in ancient times, but the former Guangdong Provincial Government (前廣東省政府) often deviated from its norms in its political measures when it ruled, and rarely considered the interests of the islanders and the development of national wealth. Therefore, Hainan Island has a history of more than 2,500 years, and it is a very fortunate and congratulatory thing that it can still maintain the integrity of its territory and the independence of its sovereignty in the dangerous international situation. At present, all the islands in the Pacific Ocean have been eaten away by imperialists in different postures - encroachment, protection. The only surviving Hainan Island has become the target of all imperialists' eyes and fingers. Facts tell us: Hainan Island is already "a storm is coming, the wind fills the building." We should not only actively arm and defend Greater Hainan; but also passively not forget the rapid development of Hainan Island to strengthen our economic fortress.</p>
<p>Observing Hainan Island from a National Defense Perspective</p>
<p>If we look at it from the geographical point of view of national defense, a place that is an important hub of sea and land transportation must have a pivotal influence on national defense. Hainan Island is separated from the Leizhou Peninsula (雷州半島) by the Qiongzhou Strait (瓊州海峽) in the north, faces Borneo (婆羅洲) and the Dutch East Indies' Java (荷屬爪哇) in the south, and borders the Philippine Islands (菲律賓羣島) in the east. The island has an area of more than 33,700 square kilometers, divided into sixteen counties. Mount Limu (黎母山) stands in the center, and the island is narrow and long. It is an important base for the navy and a must-pass place for the East Asian route. Taiwan (合灣) and Hainan (海南) islands are the two eyes of China's southeast. Now that one eye has been lost, at least he should not be blinded in both eyes. The Yulin Port (楡林港) on the island can be used as a very good telegram port for national defense, because it is the first gateway for Europe to sail east. History has proved the certainty of this sentence (During the Russo-Japanese War, the Baltic Fleet berthed here.) A Japanese naval colonel once "praised" Hainan Island as Japan's lifeline. He said, "Hainan Island is the base for operations against Guangdong and Guangxi (兩廣). If Japan can control Yulin Port (楡林港) as a military port and concentrate all the excellent fleets here, he can immediately take the initiative in the local situation. It can not only contain China's South China Sea, but also reduce the military value of Hong Kong, indirectly depriving the British of their interests in the Far East, making the French fleet in Xaigon (刹衣港) sigh at the sea, and the voyage of the American elite fleet also become his urn, so Japan controls the sea power of the outer South Seas, and of course can regard himself as the leader of the East." The National Father Sun Zhongli (孫總理) had long been aware of this, so in his National Construction Strategy (建國方略), he planned to develop this port as a military port in southern China. Observing the overall situation of the island, it is indeed a very important base in the Pacific Ocean and the gateway to protect South China in the current Sino-Japanese War!</p>
<p>Observing Hainan Island from an Economic Perspective</p>
<p>Hainan Island, which the Chinese people call "barren and evil land," is indeed an uncultivated virgin land. In terms of agriculture, because the climate is suitable and the natural lands are exceptionally fertile, most of the islanders live by farming. Tropical plants such as areca, coconut, rubber, and banana have amazing outputs every year. These outputs are not only the main raw materials in industry, but also indispensable raw materials in military chemical industry. In addition, the output of daily necessities, such as rice, sugarcane, peanuts, coffee, tea, beans, and tobacco, is also very rich. As for minerals, copper, silver, iron, tin, lead, etc. are produced. Because there is no sufficient capital, these natural treasures have not been fully exploited. In addition, animal husbandry, on which most islanders rely for their livelihoods, and the annual exports of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, etc., have become Hong Kong's only imports, and the output has become an important industry in Hainan Island. Also, because it is surrounded by the sea, the rich fishing grounds are spread all over the place. Although the fishing methods are immature and there is competition from Japanese fishing boats, the output is still very considerable. To sum up, if we can fully develop Hainan Island, the position of China's largest island will definitely be able to keep pace with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Observing Hainan Island from a Cultural Perspective</p>
<p>The residents of the entire island can be divided into two types: about 1.8 million Han Chinese and 960,000 barbarian Han Chinese. Most of the Han Chinese are from Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and a few from Zhejiang. The barbarian people are divided into raw Li (生黎), Miao Li (苗黎), Li (黎), and Qi Li (歧黎). The distribution of the population is centered on Qiongzhou (瓊州). The Han Chinese mostly live in the plains, and the Li people, except for a few who belong to the water, mostly live in the deep mountains and are extremely barbaric and have no culture at all. The language is of course extremely complicated. It is said that to live on the island, you must be able to understand at least five or six languages, otherwise you will feel very difficult. Local residents are ignorant, and the simplicity of the villagers' minds, the shallowness of knowledge, the corruption of consciousness, and the rudeness of actions all make people sigh and worry. The work of saving the country is not from top to bottom. "Hundreds of millions of ignorant people are called no people." It is not only "no people," but often easily becomes "rebellious people" because these people are most easily bought and used by the × people, and even do not realize that they are traitors. When the Chinese nation is at its most critical moment, we should cherish every bit of financial and human resources and not let them be wasted or abandoned. Then, the 2.4 million human resources on Hainan Island, do we just abandon them in vain?</p>
<p>Protect Greater Hainan, Develop Greater Hainan.</p>
<h3 id="e37">The Navigation of Each Port from Changjiang (长江) to Rugao (如皋) is Monopolized by × <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Rugao (如皋) Communication] Since Tongru (通如) fell into the enemy's hands, Xinsheng (新生), Zhanghuang (張　), Tiansheng (天生), each port has been occupied by the Japanese army. Only merchants are allowed to enter and exit through Niantuo (碾陀), Xiaoli (小李), Siyu (絲　), each port where the Chinese army is stationed. The Japanese army is determined to operate Xinsheng (新生) and Zhanghuang (張黃) ports to lure merchants, and from time to time burn the passengers and goods of the port army's stationed ports with steamships, using inducement and coercion. They also burned Zhouxu Port (周墟港) last month, intending to force all passengers and goods to enter and exit through the Xinzhang (新張) ports to increase tax revenue. On the 14th of this month, around dawn, more than 100 Japanese troops pushed westward from Nantong Pingchao (南通平潮), first occupying Wujie Bridge (五節橋), and then occupying Niantuo (碾陀) and Siyu (絲漁) ports, and stationed around Yingfang Port (營防港), carrying many steel cannons and military supplies, and indiscriminately fired guns to show off their power. Residents fled in droves. The guerrillas, with a disparity in forces, guarded the four suburbs and waited for an opportunity to counterattack. It is heard that the Japanese army is digging trenches and building fortifications at Niantuo Port (碾陀港) and other places, and has not burned civilian houses, seemingly intending to station there permanently. If they occupy it for a long time and do not leave, then there will be no place for each port of Tongru (通如) to safely enter and exit, and the navigation will almost all fall into the hands of the Japanese. On the 15th, the British merchant ship Huangpu (黃浦) sailed from Shanghai, but because of the chaos along the river, it was inconvenient to unload and load, so it returned to Zhong (中) with the passengers and goods on the original ship, taking the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (浙贛鐵路) to Lanzhou (蘭州). Which sections of the entire line are highways? Which sections are trains? What are the starting and ending place names and the minimum fares for each section? Are there any expensive branches in each place it passes through, and how much are the fees? Si Pantai Feng (四潘泰封)</p>

<p>And its Scenery along the Route</p>
<p>Yishan (宜山) is 119 kilometers from Liuzhou (柳州) and 70 kilometers from Datang (大塘). The city is located on the south bank of the Liujiang River (柳江), and its shape is like a boat. The land outside the city is flat, with small stones stretching for dozens of miles, like iron chains tying the boat. There are many famous scenic spots nearby. To the north is Beishan (北山), also known as Huixianyuan (會仙由). There is a stone dragon in the Bailong Cave (白龍洞) on it, which is where Lu Xiting (陸西亭) of Hedong (河東) walked in the late Tang Dynasty (唐末). Jinxiange Pavilion (金仙閣) next to the mountain, red and green trees, birds and flowers, has the interest of odd stones. To the south is Nanshan (南山). The stones of Longyindong Cave (龍隱洞) are smooth, and the scales and armor are clearly visible. In front of the cave, the Buddhist temple Qing'an (淸庵) is quite spacious. Yanglou (陽樓) is in Nanshan Temple (南山寺), deep forest and daylight pavilion, the evening bell, rising with the meaning of things outside. To the west is Xiangshan Temple (香山寺), with strange rocks and various shapes. The Eight Views are Fantianmen (梵天門), Guanyinge Pavilion (觀音閣), Chaotianshi Stone (朝天石), Randengmen Gate (燃燈門), Putuo Shore (普陀岸), Putilu Road (菩提路), Diyunting Pavilion (滴雲亭), and Xiyunxiu Mountain (噓雲岫), all of which are wonders. Outside Xiguan (西關) is the Huangshangu Yiguan Tomb (黃山谷衣冠墓), with stone rafts surrounding the tomb. Hechi (河池) is 92 kilometers west of Yishan (宜山) and 221 kilometers from Liuzhou (柳州). It is a lodging station on the Liuer Section (柳二段) of the Southwest Highway. Nandan (南丹) is 56 kilometers northwest of Hechi (河池) and 277 kilometers from Liuzhou (柳州). Before the highway was opened, this was a barbarian land. It is surrounded by mountains, all of which are protruding and steep, with strange shapes, producing sweet potatoes, corn, etc. Near the border with Hechi (河池), there is tin ore, but the reserves are not large.</p>
<p>Liuan (六案) is located at the junction of Guizhou (黔) and Guangxi (桂), 52 kilometers from Nandan (南丹), in the mountains. There is a park in the south, which was opened by the garrison. There are many nearby, and every time the furnace is lit, they carry local products here to exchange for the missing, just like the ancient legacy.</p>
<p>5. Liuzhang Line (柳長錢) runs north from Liuzhou (柳州) to Chang'an (長安), a total of 115 kilometers, passing through Changtang (長塘), Shatang (沙塘), Shipaiping (石牌坪), Shanglei (上雷), Shapu (沙浦), Taiping (太平), Daliang (大良), Shaping (沙坪), Dongjiang (東江), Fushi (浮石), and ten stations. Construction began in December of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (民國十五年) after surveying in September, and was completed and opened to traffic in October of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (民國十七年). The beams are divided into stone and brick arch bridges and stone and brick pier support standard board bridges. There are 43 degrees, and 351 culverts. The maximum slope is 8%, and the minimum radius of the curve is 40 meters.</p>
<p>There are no large cities along this route, and the industry and commerce are not developed. Fushi (浮石) is 103 kilometers from Zizhou (州). To its west is Rong County (融縣), with the scenic spots of Zhenxianyan Rock (眞仙岩), Wuhua Rock (五華岩), and Yunjishan Mountain (雲際山). Zhenxianyan Rock (眞仙岩) was originally named Lingyan Mountain (靈岩山). There is a Laojun Cave (老君洞) on it, which is 20 zhang high. There is a stone carving of Laojun (老君). Lingshou Stream (靈壽溪) runs through it. There are inscriptions from the Song Yuanyou Party (宋元佑黨) and many stone carvings from former sages at the cliff. Wuhua Rock (五華岩) has two stones, one lying like a tiger and one winding like a dragon, called Longyinhushi Stone (龍吟虎　石). Zhixi Creek (至華溪) flows down, and Carp Rock (鯉魚岩) stands to the right. Luoquan (邏壑深泉) adds to the coldness and beauty. Yunjishan Mountain (雲際山) is majestic and tall. There are two springs on it, Cuiyu (翠玉) and Hanbi (寒碧), which are also beautiful. Chang'an (長安) produces tung oil, tea oil, and fir wood is mostly used for wood. Liushi Line (柳石綫) runs south from Liuzhou (柳州) to Shilong (石龍), a total of 52 kilometers, passing through Yangjiaoshan Bridge (羊角山大橋), Sifangtang (四方塘), Chuanshan (穿山), Mushan (木山), and Zhongtuan (中團) six stations. It was built between the fourteenth and fifteenth years of the Republic of China (民國十四十五年). There are 14 bridges, 9 semi-permanent and 5 permanent. There are 66 culverts, mostly temporary. The maximum slope is 8%, and there are not many roads, and the minimum radius is 50 kilometers. The road surface is paved with gravel.</p>
<p>Shilong is a port city in Xiang County (象縣), located on the north bank of the Liujiang River (柳江). The electric boat can reach Wuzhou (梧州) in two days, so cargo merchants often load goods in Wuzhou (梧州), take the waterway to Shi (石), and then load the trucks to Liuzhou (柳州) by highway, which can be reached in three hours. Although it takes more time than directly shipping to Liuzhou (柳州) by car from Wuzhou (梧州), it is more cost-effective in terms of shipping costs.</p>
<p>C. Centered on Yulin (鬰林)</p>
<p>Yulin (鬱林), also known as Yulin (玉林), is located in southern Guangxi (廣西), on the left side of Goulu Mountain (勾漏山), and is the commercial center of Miaolin (謬林), Bai (白), Beiliu (北流), Luchuan (陸川), and Xingye (興業) five counties. There is the South Canal (南運河) waterway to Beihai (北海) in Guangdong. All products in the Qinlian (欽廉) area are transported to Yu (鬰) through this canal to be transferred to various places. The most prosperous industry is the local 2 industry. According to statistics, there are about 1,000 weaving households and 2,000 looms in the county, with an annual output of 300,000 pieces. In addition to self-use, they can also be sold abroad. Its quality is more refined than Guilin cloth. The main agricultural product is rice, which is transported by waterway. In addition, tangerines, oranges, plums, etc. are also produced. The famous scenic spots are Zhitang Ridge (豸堂嶺). The Beidi Temple (北帝廟) on the ridge was built in the Song Dynasty (宋代) and rebuilt during the Qing Jiaqing period (淸嘉慶間). There is a tower called Gu Wanhualou Tower (古萬花樓). Zhuoying Spring (濯纓泉) is on the Nanliu Binhai River (南流濱江). Huge stones protrude, and the spring is gushing. Looking from a distance, it looks like silk. A little farther from the city, to the northeast is Hanshan Mountain (寒山), and below is Longtan Pond (龍潭). There is a Feilaishi Stone (飛來石) on the side of the pond, inscribed with the four characters "Ganying Longshen (感應龍神)". It produces small bamboo, which is less than a foot high. It withers when transplanted. Different species. Directly north is the Waterfall Spring (瀑布泉). The waterfall rushes down from the top of the mountain, with a white silk hanging in the air, reaching dozens of zhang. To the northwest is Yinxianyan Rock (隱仙岩), which is a separate trunk of Hanshan Mountain (寒山). It is dense and beautiful. There is a stone guest with an area of several mu in the middle, and the stone milk is all over the county, full of beautiful things. There are human footprints on the stone, and no moss grows, which is called "Stone Chamber Fairy Trail (石室仙蹤)".</p>
<p>The highways starting from Yulin (鬱林) include Yuwu Line (鬱梧), Liuyu Line (柳鬱), Yongyu Line (邕鬱), Yushi Line (鬱石), and Yubo Line (鬱博). In addition, the Guigui Line (貴桂線) starts from Guixian County (貴縣), and the Rongwu Line (容武線) starts from Rong County (容縣).</p>
<p>1. Yuwu Line (鬱梧綫) runs northwest from Yulin (鬱林) to Xinzhen Market (　墟), which is across the river from Wuzhou (梧州), passing through Xinxu (新墟), Beiliu (北流), Xishan (西山), Rong County (容縣), Shi (石　), 　yin (　蔭), Youma (油蔴), Liuwang (六旺), Pangu (盤古), Nandu (南渡), Malu (馬路), 　cun (　村), Cenxi (岑溪), Liuyun (六云), Shahe (沙河), Nuo (糯　), Taiping (太平), Hui (迴), Xinpu (新舖), Xindi (新地), Guling (古嶺), and Tipu (題舖) twenty-two stations, with a total length of 210 kilometers, 138 bridges, 59 of which are permanent, and culverts are all permanent, totaling 653 degrees. It is built in three sections. The first section is from Yulin (鬰林) to Beiliu (北流), 34 kilometers, completed in the 16th year of the Republic of China (民國十六年). There are dense populations along the route, and there are only three or four bridges. Except for the Zhuoyi Gorge (朱衣峽) section, which is relatively high and steep, the rest are straight and flat, and the car travels steadily. The second section is from Beipu (北浦) to Rong County (容縣), a total of 34 kilometers. It began in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (民國十三年), and was opened to traffic in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (民國十六年). However, due to insufficient filling, the roadbed collapses when it rains. It was returned to the business community in the ninth year (上九年), but no processing was done. It was taken back in the twenty-first year (二十一年), and re-repaired, filled the roadbed, and paved with sandstone and gravel, and the wooden bridges were replaced, which was improved. The third section is from Rong County (容縣) to Wuzhou (梧州), 172 kilometers long, built in the 15th year of the Republic of China (民國十五年), and sandstone was added later in the 21st year (二十一年). There are many mountains and small valleys along the route, such as Xiaotang'ao (小塘拗), Lulingjie (綠靈界), and Niu'aojie (牛　界), and the slope is very large, increasing to 10%.</p>
<p>Before the Guangdong Incident (粵變), those who entered the southwest from Hong Kong mostly followed the waterway to Wuzhou (梧州) first, and then went west along this line. At that time, the Yuwu Road (鬱梧道) was quite prosperous. Today, the Hong Kong-Wuzhou Road (港梧路) is blocked, and Wuzhou (梧州) has become a dead city. The passenger and freight transportation on this line has plummeted. I sincerely cannot bear the feeling of today and yesterday.</p>

<p>The Bank of England, a British merchant bank, has its headquarters in London, England, and was founded in 1920. The Shanghai branch is located at 28 Huangpu Beach Road (黃浦灘路). The comprador is Xu Maotang (徐懋堂). The bank's capital is £5,000,000, and the paid-up capital is £2,594,160. The business scope includes all banking businesses. Now, with the resolution of the London headquarters, the Shanghai branch will be merged into the British merchant Chartered Bank. All procedures have been properly handled and will be implemented from February 1st this year. At that time, the name of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of England will be cancelled, and all debts and claims will be transferred to the Chartered Bank for continued handling. As for the branches in Xianggang (杳港) and the headquarters in London, they will still operate as usual. After the Shanghai branch is merged, some employees will also be transferred to Chartered Bank to serve.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Our Ministry of Finance is Determined to Maintain Creditworthiness; Unified and Reconstructive Bonds Will Be Paid in Full as Usual <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is determined to maintain its creditworthiness. The National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to conduct drawings for principal repayment as usual. The Unified Bonds maturing at the end of this month and the Reconstructive Bonds maturing at the end of February will be fully paid in Chongqing. Over the past year, customs revenue has not decreased significantly. Although there are dedicated funds that have not been allocated, the government is still accommodating overdrafts, demonstrating its full creditworthiness. This has attracted a wave of international sentiment. Compared with the Japanese seizure of tax revenue, it further highlights the government's great attitude. Bonds have dedicated funds, unlike those with guarantees but insufficient income. Moreover, there are substantial dedicated funds accumulated due to guarantees. Therefore, the government's recent cessation of accommodating overdrafts is a common practice. Since the British and Japanese sides announced the customs agreement, transferring tax revenue to the Japanese side, our government has lodged a protest with Britain, resulting in the lack of some bond interest funds today. Chinese and foreign individuals should be aware of this and know where the responsibility lies. The government's response to this situation is very appropriate. In addition to notifying that no further overdrafts will be accommodated for debts guaranteed by customs revenue, it also declared that for all long-term debts guaranteed by customs revenue borrowed before the war and not yet repaid, the proportion of customs revenue outside the war zone will be allocated to the Central Bank on a regular basis for dedicated storage. It also stated that when customs offices in the war zone remit the already stored and owed debt repayment funds and subsequent tax revenue according to the original ratio to the Inspectorate General of Customs, the debt and indemnity funds will still be allocated. This further demonstrates the government's attitude of maintaining creditworthiness. Regarding the lottery repayment of domestic debt, the National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to hold them as usual. The public bonds to be drawn on February 10 are Class A bonds of the Unified Bonds. The Class A, B, C, D, and E bonds of the Unified Bonds maturing on January 31, as well as the principal and interest of the Reconstructive Bonds maturing on February 28. As for the repayment method for the interest of 412.875 yuan and the principal of 1,125,000 yuan of the Financial Loan Bonds of the Republic of China Year 17 maturing on March 31, no orders have yet been received by the Ministry.</p>

<h3 id="e43">South China's Southern Expedition Team: Performance After Landing at Haiphong; Return Delayed, Arriving in Hong Kong on the 27th <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Although the South China football team did not achieve complete victory in this expedition, the results were still satisfactory. It is noted that the team returned from Phnom Penh to Cochinchina on the 20th, and played another match with the Cochinchina First Team on the 21st. They departed on the 23rd and were originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received an airmail letter from Team Leader Mok, stating that the team would not be able to return to Hong Kong until the 27th. When the team was competing in Cochinchina, our consul stationed in Haiphong made a special trip to Cochinchina to contact the team, saying that the local overseas Chinese very much hoped that the South China team would land in Haiphong on their way back and put on a performance match to satisfy the overseas Chinese's eagerness. The team, seeing the overseas Chinese in Haiphong's such love and support, found it difficult to refuse, and agreed to the request. Therefore, they will be landing in Haiphong for a competition on their way back and staying for one night, thus delaying the return and requiring them to return to Hong Kong on the 27th.</p>

<p>— Translated by an Old Friend of the Court</p>
<p>Speaking of the current state of sports in our country, the men's sector is certainly behind, but the women's sector is even further behind. Leaving aside other sports, taking tennis, which is suitable for both men and women, as an example, it has already made concerned people feel that active training is a must. For example, the recently concluded Hong Kong Women's Open Tennis Competition was somewhat disappointing for concerned people. Compared to the Westerners, aren't the Chinese people in Hong Kong outnumbered by a ratio that someone once used as 97 to 3? In that huge difference of 97 to 3, and when many talents gathered, statistically speaking in the women's tennis singles and doubles matches, the crowd of 97 percent couldn't beat the mere 3 percent, and only got half a championship (referring to Madam Chiu Chun Chiu partnering with a Western woman to win the doubles title). This is truly shameful.</p>
<p>There are very few educational materials in our country, especially writings on tennis, which are very scarce. Therefore, there is a great lack of women's tennis talent. Among them, if one can be active in society and get guidance from male tennis players, or if one's English proficiency is sufficient to find Western teaching materials to read and study, one can still hope to play properly. Otherwise, even if one plays for fun in schools with tennis courts, it's just playing around. It's already difficult to ask for proper playing methods and steps, let alone progress, and even more impossible to hope to jump into the international tennis scene. Therefore, based on the purpose of promoting sports, I am willing to find some writings on women's tennis to translate, in order to create opportunities for those sisters who are seeking to improve in ball games. (To be continued)</p>

<p>There are three women's basketball games at the YMCA tonight at 6:30 pm. This is the last time they will be held after the establishment of the new league. After these three games, the entire season will end. Tonight's first game is between Mui Fong and Paul. Mui Fong has been invincible since the start of the league. Paul is a weak team in this year's competition. Tonight, when facing the strong Mui Fong, they will definitely be defeated. The second game is between Snowflakes and Southwest, with Southwest expected to win. The third game is between Sze Sze and South China. Although Sze Sze's strength is not as good as South China's, Sze Sze has improved, so South China will not win easily.</p>

<p>The inter-school table tennis competition organized by the Wah Keung Sports Association: the match between Ho Lam and Kowloon the night before last, due to the strong strength of both sides, was very intense. The match lasted until 11 PM before the outcome was decided. As a result, Kowloon barely won by three to two. The most intense of the five group matches was Lai Siu-Hon vs. Chung Chak-Yung. After a hard-fought three games, each game differed by only two or three points. Fortunately, Siu-Hon won with a score of two to one, securing Kowloon's victory.</p>
<p>Now that Kowloon has defeated Ho Lam, if they can buy Yongyim, Kekong and Kwongda tomorrow night, the championship will be theirs. However, Kwongda's strength is not weak and will not be easy to defeat. The competition venue is still at the Confucius Society, with a ticket price of two corners. All proceeds will be donated to the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Rescue Corps. The recent results of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>(Team Name) Matches Wins Losses Points</p>
<p>Kowloon College 4 4 0 4</p>

<p>Entertainment... Beg, Borrow or Steal</p>
<p>Beg, Borrow or Steal is a crazy comedy about a high-class son who always says outlandish things. Once, he boasted to his wife and daughter that he had bought a villa in the Riviera. Unexpectedly, his wife and daughter took the unintentional lie as truth. It happened that his daughter was getting married and planned to hold the wedding in the villa. Because the son's words were still in their ears and he did not want to hurt his beloved daughter's feelings, he had no choice but to borrow a villa from someone to temporarily act the part of a rich man. At the same time, he also invited a group of good brothers to impersonate important guests. Later, he was surrounded by those he had cheated and monitored by the police. At the same time, his daughter discovered that she had fallen in love with the wrong person, making things worse. When he couldn't maintain it anymore, he bravely exposed his own secrets for the sake of his daughter.</p>
<p>Frank Morgan's skilled and experienced acting produced a lot of laughter. The performances of the male and female leads, John Beal and Florence Rice, in the two-sex pursuit also added a lot of romantic fun. In short, this film is an entertaining work.</p>
<p>Eastern... You're Only Young Once</p>
<p>This is a very meaningful film that gives young men and women enlightenment on love. The story is very simple, depicting a very happy family. The head of the family is a just and wise judge with a son and a daughter, both in their youth. When they went to California as a family, his children all went astray in complex love affairs. Fortunately, their father painstakingly corrected them and rescued them from dangerous situations.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Louis Stone is certainly the most successful. His portrayal of the psychology of young people in love is very clear, and his own sincere attitude is also well outlined. Shirley Temple and Mickey Rooney are also very good.</p>
<p>Queen... Touchdown, Army</p>
<p>This film is mostly set in the US West Point Military Academy, showing its strict discipline and neat meeting areas. It also interspersed a triangular romantic comedy, and concluded with a tense and lively football match. This kind of story is not new, but the overall performance of the play is quite successful.</p>
<p>The content describes a frivolous playboy who is willing to enter military school for a woman, enduring all kinds of hardships. Unexpectedly, this woman's heart already belongs to someone else. Later, because of his superb football skills, he makes a great splash and wins the woman's favor.</p>
<p>The football matches and meeting scenes in the film are mostly edited from newsreels, but because of the skillful technique, they do not show any traces. John Wayne plays a small instructor in the film and is not as brilliant as he is in detective films.</p>
<p>Ping On... White Banners</p>
<p>Adapted from the recent work "White Banners" by the great writer Lloyd C. Douglas, the story itself is very meaningful. The script is well-written and the allocation of actors is also appropriate. The overall performance is very moving. The plot is very ethical. It may not be of interest to ordinary people. But if you are patient to look further you will find this worthwhile.</p>
<p>Claude Rains has always had great success in his performances. This time he plays a teacher who loves his job, and his performance is very insightful. In addition, several supporting actors, such as Fay Bainter, Jackie Cooper, and Bobby Jordan, as well as the child Bennie Bartlett, who has always played villain roles, change their style and play a passionate young man, are all excellent and satisfying.</p>
<p>Great China... The Little Tough Guy</p>
<p>This film features a group of naughty kids from the slums. There are two very talented actors but neither appear in this film. The plot is roughly the same as previous works. A group of naughty kids are eventually arrested and sent to a reformatory to be reformed. The performance is also relatively poor.</p>
<p>King Sing... Things to Come</p>
<p>Central... The Pearl Shirt</p>
<p>It was not long after the death of Richard Talmadge of Hollywood that there was a Chinese version of Richard Talmadge. This kind of speculative method does not require the effort of publicity and can reap the benefits of publicity. The cleverness of Chinese filmmakers can be seen from this. However, the arrangement of the content story of this film is not exhaustive. At the same time, the tense scenes also failed to be fully developed. The depiction of the behavior and actions of bandits is more of a failure than a success. The allocation of actors is also not very suitable. Apart from Liu Qiong, who has considerable success, Gu Lan-Chun and Hong-Jing-Ling didn’t have much presence. Xu Huayuan's Richard Talmadge-like facial makeup is quite similar, but the imitation of the action aspect is yet to be seen.</p>

<p>(Saigon Special Dispatch) The South China team's defeat to the Southern Ky team last Sunday has deeply saddened the overseas Chinese. It was truly due to their relentless efforts and extreme fatigue, allowing the well-rested opponents to take advantage. It was certainly not their fault. Considering that they were able to defeat the Ke Do Heng Police United team last night, the 15th, with an incomplete team, we can expect great hope for their upcoming match against the Southern Ky team on Saturday, which is a fundraising event. It is understood that the Ke Do Heng and Police teams are the champions of this area and are also skilled in night matches. Furthermore, six of their players were from the Southern Ky team of the previous Sunday, showing that the difference in skill is not too significant.</p>
<p>The stone stadium was still full that night, although not as crowded as the previous Sunday. South China and the United team entered amidst applause from the crowd. The lineup for the night was as follows:</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>Cheung Wing-choi, Lee Tin-sang, Lee Kwok-wai, Lam Tak-po, Lau Hing-choi, Lau Tin-sun (replaced by Tse Kam-hung), Law Tau-man, Lau Chung-sang, Chan Tak-fai, Fung King-cheung, Tang Kwong-sum (replaced by Yeung Shui-yik)</p>
<p>United Team</p>
<p>Ah Bin, Ah Che, Ah Lung, Ah Yat, Ba Si Ni, Ah Man, Ah Tai, Ah Tin, Ah Tok, Ah Bun, Ah Man</p>
<p>The silver whistle blew.</p>
<p>The United Team took the offensive.</p>
<p>In just three minutes, Ah Tok received the ball and passed it. As the ball approached the goal, at this critical moment, Tin-sang slid and hooked the ball, sending it to the right. Unfortunately, Ah Tai was there and kicked it in from only a few feet away. South China fell behind, with the score at 1-0. In the second half, the United Team continued its offensive. After ten minutes of chaotic play, Ah Tai got the ball and kicked it with great speed. Cheung Wing-choi managed to block the ball, sending it out of bounds, resulting in a corner kick. However, Wing-choi also blocked that. After South China narrowly escaped danger, they went straight to the enemy's territory. When they reached the enemy's goal, Tang Kwong-sum kicked the ball, sending up a cloud of dust, and the enemy goalkeeper fell. Unfortunately, the aim was not accurate, and the ball went past the goal. The enemy goalkeeper then kicked it out. The enemy forces launched a counterattack, reaching the South China territory, only five feet away from the goal. It was extremely dangerous, but Tin-sang managed to slide and kick the ball out of bounds, resulting in a corner kick. After a period of chaotic play, Wing-choi caught the ball. At this time, Ah Tok's foot was slightly injured but he was still able to play. Soon, the ball was taken to the enemy's territory by the South China team, only an inch away from the goal. Lau Chung-sang kicked, but it was too weak and was blocked by Ah Che, who launched a counterattack towards the South China side. South China was then penalized with a corner kick, but Wing-choi managed to catch the ball.</p>
<p>After a Long Struggle,</p>
<p>The Enemy Cavalry Invaded Again</p>
<p>Ah Tok, only twelve feet away from the goal, passed to Ah Tai. At this moment, the audience held their breath, thinking that South China would certainly concede this goal. Unexpectedly, Ah Tai kicked the ball too high, averting the danger. The South China players then seized the opportunity to counterattack, threatening the enemy's goal. However, both times King-cheung and Lau Chung-sang kicked, the goalkeeper caught the ball. Soon, the enemy pressed forward again. Only ten feet away from the goal, Ah Man passed to Ah Tai, attempting a solo effort. Unexpectedly, Chung-sang shouted and charged forward, kicking the ball out of bounds. King-cheung caught the ball and dribbled it all the way to the enemy territory, passing it to Chung-sang. Chung-sang kicked the ball, but it was blocked by Ah Lung's head. Tang Kwong-sum quickly caught the ball and passed it to King-cheung, who then passed it to Tak-fai. Unfortunately, he couldn't get a good foot on it and kicked it too slowly. The goalkeeper caught the ball again. However, King-cheung regained possession and passed it to Tak-fai, who passed it to Kwong-sum. He kicked it straight in. Although the enemy goalkeeper blocked it, the ball bounced out of bounds, resulting in a corner kick, which was taken by Kwong-sum. As the ball reached the goal, King-cheung jumped up and headed it into the net. South China scored a goal, tying the score. It was about twenty minutes after the kickoff.</p>
<p>Regaining Lost Ground,</p>
<p>South China's Morale Soared</p>
<p>Each player showed their skills. King-cheung turned left and right, making the enemy run tirelessly. Then, Law Tau-man dribbled, making the enemy chase him with sweat pouring down their backs. The audience applauded loudly. Later, King-cheung kicked two balls and had a corner kick, but none hit the target. Soon, Lau Tin-sun got the ball and passed it to King-cheung, who then passed it to Tak-fai. The ball was at the feet of the famous player, with only mud and no ball visible. When the enemy goalkeeper turned around, the ball was already in the net. South China scored another goal. Soon, it was lemon time, and the first half ended with a score of 2-1, with South China leading.</p>
<p>After the lemon break, the enemy blamed the ball and insisted on changing it before resuming the match. After about ten minutes of chaotic play, Ah Man missed two shots. However, these two shots were the most dangerous of the entire match. One was only a few feet away from the goal, and Wing-choi had already fallen. The ball went past the goalpost. The other hit the crossbar and bounced to the ground, rolling out of bounds in front of Wing-choi. The speed of the ball was like a swift arrow, extremely dangerous. Later, the enemy cavalry launched a fierce attack on South China's goal. Only a few feet away from the goal, Tin-sang went up to block the enemy's path. This was usually a common occurrence, but the referee was influenced by the</p>
<p>Audience,</p>
<p>Obeying the Audience's Wishes</p>
<p>After the referee asked the linesman, he intended to award a corner kick. Unexpectedly, the audience disagreed and shouted for a free kick. The referee then changed the corner kick to a free kick. The opponent thought they would certainly score. Unexpectedly, a divine general stood guard, invincible. Wing-choi blocked the ball, and it bounced off the crossbar and out of the net, resulting in another corner kick, which was also unsuccessful. In an instant, South China was penalized with another free kick, which was taken by Ah Tok. Despite his intelligence, there was a lapse, and South China conceded this goal, making the score 2-2. The audience was extremely angry at this time. Soon, the enemy attacked again, reaching the South China goal. Wing-choi came out to meet them, slightly touching Ah Tai. Unexpectedly, the opponent became angry out of shame and attacked Wing-choi. The linesman on the right even broke the rules by entering the field to cause trouble and tried to beat Chung-sang. At this time, the audience had reached the limit of their endurance.</p>
<p>Great Disorder,</p>
<p>People Rushed into the Field to Fight</p>
<p>After mediation by Chinese and Western individuals, the linesman was finally dismissed and removed from the field. Order was then restored, and the game resumed. The South China players bravely advanced. Tak-fai kicked the ball, and before the dust settled, the ball was already in the net, making the score 3-2. The ball was moved, and the battle continued. The ball was again dribbled by the enemy cavalry. Only ten feet away from the South China goal, Ah Man kicked the ball, but it was blocked by Wing-choi, resulting in a corner kick, which was also unsuccessful. Soon, King-cheung got the opportunity and passed it to Shui-yik. Shui-yik went straight in and kicked the ball, making the score 4-2. In the last few minutes, the enemy repeatedly pressed on South China's territory. On one occasion, Ah Tok went straight in, but Tin-sang couldn't catch up. He kicked the ball from only a few feet away from the goal, but it was blocked by Wing-choi. The opponents sighed. On another occasion, Ah Tok got the ball and passed it to Ah Man. At this time, Ah Man was alone, only a few feet away from the goal. Unexpectedly, the ball came unexpectedly and hit his left foot, slowly rolling away. Wing-choi caught it almost effortlessly. Ah Man could only stomp his feet in frustration. Afterwards, the game continued back and forth, with nothing remarkable to record. Soon, time was up, and South China celebrated its victory again with a score of 4-2. (Zhu Zhaoheng Special)</p>

<h3 id="e54">The Lost Writings of Qifeng <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Jun</p>
<p>— A Note on a National Novel</p>
<p>The Lost Writings of Qifeng, which was included in the first compilation of the Garden of Stories in Xianyang, has recently been published as a separate volume. The book was written by the Qifeng Woodcutter. The author's own preface does not reveal anything about his life. Although the entire book has sixty chapters, each chapter only has a few hundred words, with the shortest being only two hundred words, such as the third chapter, and the longest being only a little over a thousand words, such as the fourteenth, fifty-third, and fifty-fourth chapters. This is quite different from the usual long novels with chapters. The scope covered in the book is quite broad, but it lacks organization, making it seem like miscellaneous notes. According to Sun Kai's "Supplement and Correction" to the Bibliography of Chinese Popular Novels, it is "similar to the Miscellaneous Records of the Sea Corner, which records events in literary Chinese." The book mainly focuses on the beginning and end of the resistance against the Qing people's hair-shaving order and the organization of the militia in Changshu and Fushan. It also briefly narrates the events of the Hongguang Dynasty in Nanjing (chapters 12) and the popular uprisings sparked by the same incident in the neighboring counties of Suzhou and Jiangyin (chapters 15-17, 49). The scope of the Lost Writings is quite broad. The locations include metropolises, cities, towns, and villages, and the characters range from emperors, princes, officials, and soldiers to traitors, big and small lackeys, and hooligans. It records the ugliness of all parties during the chaotic times, and the most detailed descriptions are of the local customs at the time, which were probably what the author personally experienced.</p>
<p>Judging from the entire book, it is written in a very mediocre manner. Although it is difficult to find any major flaws, it also does not have any advantages. Besides the dry and tasteless records, there is very little dialogue. From a literary point of view, there is nothing to talk about. However, this book should not be regarded as a novel, but should be understood as historical material. Only in this way will it not be misunderstood. The historical significance, such as the Qing army's plunder of daughters, silk, and treasures, and their bestial massacres, are all valuable documents. The thirty-fifth chapter records the tragic death of Chen Ruyang, saying: "When the city was broken, his family barely managed to report, unable to walk. The husband and wife could only weep in despair. They were tied to the flagpole of Lu Yiji's house by soldiers, and his wife was stabbed to death in the bed in their home. On the third day, after the soldiers left, the villagers saw them, cut the ropes, but there was still a trace of breath in his throat." Such inhuman brutality would make anyone who saw it indignant. But who would have thought that more than two hundred years later, we would still suffer even worse treatment!</p>
<p>Yu Zhong also pointed out the various factors that led to the failure of the war of resistance at that time, such as the lack of fighting spirit of the official army generals, who guarded their own troops and fled in panic as soon as they were defeated. General Zheng in the fourth chapter and Hu Lai Gong in the eighth chapter are typical examples of this kind of person. There were even those who used the name of righteous soldiers to create a false impression, specializing in extorting money and food and robbing the people, as recorded in chapters 20, 21, and 23. As for the militia, except for Yan Shi's troops, most of them took advantage of the chaos to avenge themselves, resulting in a complete lack of discipline and even mutual killings (chapters 40 to 43); when faced with battle, they either remained motionless or scattered in all directions, such as Hu Longguang, who had no intention of defending the city and just watched the Qing army attack without firing a single arrow (chapter 28), and Shi Ziqiu's troops, who scattered completely as soon as they heard the news of the city's fall (chapter 31). Those in charge were either scholars who talked about war without any preparation, such as Jin Kuang, who tried to rescue Jiangyin without any prior contact or plan (chapter 18); or they seized the opportunity to seize troops without any national identity, such as Shi Ziqiu in chapter 26 and Ling Si in chapter 42. The officials and gentry at the time shamelessly surrendered and became accomplices of the enemy, such as Qian Qianyi, Xiao Shi'en, and Magistrate Ma, who were all used by the enemy one after another. Even those who were responsible for defending the territory, such as Cao Yuanfang, fled alone before the city fell. The common people, apart from trying to save their own lives, were not concerned about the safety of the nation. The most painful thing was that there were even traitors in the militia who were willing to be guides for the enemy, such as Zhao Botao, who was like the Wang Bamei and Xu Hongfa of that time. Although these are historical traces, the painful lessons will make us, who live more than two hundred years later, indignant—</p>
<p>The entire book seems to focus on Yan Shi raising local troops, but because there are so many characters and complicated threads, the position of the main characters is greatly reduced. Only five or six chapters are about Yan Shi's deeds, and there are only two times he uses soldiers, which clearly loses the unity of the entire book. The resistance of the magistrate of Fujian and the heroic sacrifice of the entire people of Jiangyin are all excellent subjects, but the author did not make good use of them, only giving a few cursory descriptions. Instead, he worked hard to write about the private fights of the people in the countryside and the stories of escaping from death, accounting for a quarter of the entire book (such as chapters 22, 28, 30, 34-36, 38, 40-43, 50, 51, 53, 54), which inevitably reversed the importance of things. The author witnessed the Qing army's massacre and should have had some good feelings for the uprising of the local troops. However, he did not, but thought it was meddlesome. For example, chapter 22 narrates Chen Mengli "daring to speak out when things happened," saying: "Changshu and Fushan are just small places. The Qing Dynasty is powerful. It is better to send someone there to negotiate and observe their movements. If we rashly raise troops, it is like using a praying mantis to stop a cart." In the thirty-seventh chapter, the author himself actually came out and said: "They are all bamboo spears and wooden sticks, wrapped in white cloth. To fight with the Qing Dynasty is really like using a praying mantis to stop a cart." This is really the same as the current "only weapons theory." The author is a person of the Ming Dynasty, and should have thoughts of the fallen state for the Ming Dynasty. For example, chapter 55 records the changing of Manchu costumes and writing. At least there should be some feelings of grief, but besides "and the customs have also changed greatly," he said nothing. In the end, he praised the alien rulers and their lackeys: "Since then, Yang Lian's prestige in training troops has become increasingly famous, and the sea soldiers (referring to the troops of the Ming Prince Yiyang) dared not invade the border, and the people once again enjoyed the blessings of peace." The author completely forgot about the insane massacre a few months ago! People like Qifeng Woodcutter, who are complacent and forgetful, are probably not rare now. Maybe they will even pull him to recognize acquaintances more than two hundred years ago. To avoid this bad influence depends on the reader's sense of proportion. This book, in the same series, is several times less valuable than the "Painful History."</p>
<h3 id="e55">Hope and Other Things <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Of course, no one has no hope, and no one does not want their hope to be realized, but few people know that hope is the most empty, useless, thin, and light thing in the world. It is the face of a child, a small boat on the Pacific Ocean, never to be grasped by people, and always playing with people's hearts. Therefore, yearning for hope is the thing that people love to do most, and it is also the most foolish thing that people do.</p>
<p>I used to hear people say, "Don't worry. The light of tomorrow is coming." These kinds of words seem to be very comfortable in my heart; it's right, but it's wrong. Dawn comes every day, even if you say "the light of tomorrow" is indeed "coming"; but if you just wait and wait until tomorrow, it is still a cloud of darkness, and all that shines is the morning sun.</p>
<p>Dawn does not come with "tomorrow", but is created by people with one hand, taken and placed in the future, letting it walk together under the skirt of "tomorrow". Of course, we welcome it when it comes; if it doesn't come, it means we are simply not worthy to receive the light.</p>
<p>Speaking of hope, you turn your head and see memories.</p>
<p>Memories are also pets of mankind. The past is sweet, yes, the past is beautiful, so what? Reversing the wheel of time? Pulling back the elapsed time? Unfortunately, humans don't have this ability.</p>
<p>Especially in articles, everyone has feelings, so why always stay in a dream and shout "sorrow", sighing a few lines "last year today..."? People are sentimental, I admit it, and I often have a lot of feelings in my heart. But I believe there is nothing to say except feelings. I often write things like memories, as if all the memories in my heart are accumulating more and more, pressing down too heavily to let them out. But in fact, in the corners of my mind, there are many things worth saying to others. It's not complaining, slogans, parroting, irresponsible remarks, and it's not a jumble of this copy and that copy, but my own life experience. My own experiences, my own knowledge.</p>
<p>As for imagination, it can also be said to be fantasy, but it cannot be said that it has no value. Good novels and good plays must be refined in the imagination to be beautiful and to be tinged with the flavor of literature.</p>
<p>Everyone has hope; everyone also has memories. But because everyone has them, they are worthless. We should escape from hope and memories, hide outside the brain, delve into the realm of reality, or add some thinking, think more and dream less. In this way, perhaps our literary world will be more refreshing, clearer, more realistic, more orderly, and there will be something worth hoping for, that is, our literary world may be able to waste less ink and save a little paper, and fully reflect this great era.</p>
<p>Of course, who wouldn't want to seize this good opportunity to write an epic, to weave blood and flesh into a picture, to depict today's human world, and leave it forever in the world?</p>
<h3 id="e56">Field Notes <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The so-called treat, when it comes to soldiers, is really too flexible. Ordinary people, when inviting guests, at least have to go to a restaurant, and a hundred and eighty doesn't count, but among the soldiers, even if you buy three cents worth of water chestnuts, you can get the praise of "treat."</p>
<p>However, under these circumstances, some "righteousness" was erected. The "foundation" and "mutual assistance" flowers bloomed in everyone's heart. Although everyone first gathered from various places, they became difficult comrades in life and death at this time. Of course, sometimes it is inevitable that they will get red in the face because of a small reason, and even scold their mothers and fathers face to face, but it doesn't matter. After a day, without anyone to persuade them, they will make peace.</p>
<p>The small restaurants in Linshan River finally made their fortunes on us. Why not eat a meal? In the original Baza place, you couldn't even find an egg. Didn't many people shout "see you later"? That was a remote little village, where you couldn't even buy a fried dough stick, let alone a restaurant. The food on the food was not lacking in meat, but people called it "pig food" and didn't eat it smoothly.</p>
<p>"Waiter, first bring four taels of wine!"</p>
<p>Wine is especially welcome among soldiers, just as they welcome cigarettes. This kind of laughable act may make outsiders shake their heads, but we don't care at all.</p>
<p>"Cut some fish and meat!"</p>
<p>"Bring a few salted duck eggs!"</p>
<p>The boss walked over with a smile on his face, holding a large fish in his hand, and said, winking:</p>
<p>"Comrades, do you want this fish?"</p>
<p>"How much money?"</p>
<p>"Can I charge you more?"</p>
<p>"Hurry up and cook it, cook it well!"</p>
<p>We set off again in the afternoon, and everyone felt a lot stronger.</p>
<p>4. Another Kind of People Living in the Countryside</p>
<p>Moving forward from Linshan River, the road was too difficult to walk, the road surface was completely paved with stones, and it was very painful to walk on. Fortunately, after walking not far, we forked onto a small road, where the grass was like a carpet, but it was very flat. But the road became narrower and narrower, and it also went into the mountain road, not as wide as when walking on the highway.</p>
<p>Next to the road, on a flat ground, there were five or six gun carriages parked. The gun muzzles were covered with tarpaulins, and camouflage was added to the carriages. There was a gunner lying under each carriage, but their eyes were already closed. The sound of our footsteps did not wake them from their good dreams. Sleeping had already made them unconsciously forget their respective duties.</p>
<p>But these guns are the sharp weapons we use to destroy the enemy. How majestic they are lying beside the road, and how much people love to carry them!</p>
<p>After turning over a small stone bridge, the mountain road became even narrower. Looking out at a glance, there were hills on the left and mountain slopes on the right. Although there were road junctions in front and behind, the distant places were still undulating small mountains. Only the road in the mountains can be regarded as a thoroughfare. The sky was still overcast, and the wind was still blowing, making the pine trees on the hillside ring. A few fallen leaves were swept into the air. It was autumn, and autumn is easy to make people feel emotional, but for a soldier, it doesn't cause much reaction. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Going to the Market <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Jiliang</p>
<p>In Beibei, Sichuan, there still exists a medieval way of trading—going to the market.</p>
<p>The locals here call going to the market "going to the field." The first day of the month and mid-month are the dates for going to the market in Beibei. On this day, goods from all over the countryside are concentrated in this small town. On both sides of the street, on the beach near the Jialing River, are piles of goods moved from various townships, and various different commodities are also placed. The residents of the nearby area also rushed from their respective villages. You feel lively, but also feel noisy.</p>
<p>The goods at the market are arranged in a certain way, which is very convenient for buyers. The products of the rural people are all brought here on this day to be displayed. Generally, rice, beans, vegetables, etc. are placed on the relatively lively main street. Leather shoes, homespun cloth, bowls, and chopsticks are concentrated in another trading area. Other livestock such as pigs, ducks, and chickens are mostly gathered on the beach along the river. As for the temporary stalls, they are also gathered here. Therefore, Beibei during the market period, which is usually deserted, has become an important exchange. If you take a plane over this place, you will suspect that a meeting may be in progress.</p>
<p>The writer stood beside a vegetable stall at the market for a while, watching many fashionable people from the lower Yangtze River, struggling to learn the fluent Sichuan dialect, wandering around the vegetable stall, with difficulty written on their faces. "The people of Sichuan like to eat spicy vegetables, we only eat green vegetables," the writer noticed that the vegetables next to them, besides green vegetables, were garlic, spring vegetables, and chili peppers. These dishes are not suitable for the taste of the average person from the lower Yangtze River. People from the water towns come to the mountain country and cannot easily eat lively fresh fish, but they often stop their chopsticks at spicy tastes. This is indeed a bitter thing. The people from the lower Yangtze River who came from the war zone should turn around and go back to their hometown!</p>
<p>Among this group of people going to the market, the reporter learned about their daily life from a conversation with a cloth vendor. It is said that among the majority of merchants going to the market, 80% rely on the income from each market to maintain the life of their whole family. Although the money they get from each market is limited, because their goods in the past did not have to go through government taxation, plus their own living expenses are very low, therefore, their income from each market, if they can earn a number of six or seven yuan, has already reached their highest satisfaction. As for the ancient method of "bartering," this has ultimately become a thing of the past. Now, this phenomenon can no longer be seen at the market here.</p>
<p>Whenever it is market time in Beibei, from 6 am to 4 pm, the place is always crowded with people. This group leaves, and another group comes. They seem to be very busy, but if you carefully analyze the actions of each person, you will know that there are many people mixed in here who did not come for trade, some are taking advantage of the market opportunity to meet their relatives and friends, and some are just watching the excitement. Although they gather in the same place from different places, everyone's heart hides different hopes.</p>
<p>Recently, because of the expansion of the war zone, many institutions and schools have returned to Beibei, and many shops have also opened. Unlike in the past, the business here seems to be scattered. After this change, the commerce of Beibei should also gradually modernize.</p>
