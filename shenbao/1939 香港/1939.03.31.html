<p>社評</p>
<h3>熱烈歡迎僑胞回國效命</h3>
<p>抗戰轉入更緊急更嚴重階段了！</p>
<p>這是一個决定全中華民族生存或是滅亡，奴隸或是自由的轉捩階段。</p>
<p>抗戰轉捩階段，也就是由「×優我劣」「×勝我敗」轉入「×我相持「勢均力×」的階段。在這新階段中，×人的主力尙未遭受致命的打擊，我們的實力亦未進步到足以「克×致果」的必要程度，因此×人尙能高度地發揮其戰鬥力，繼續逞其攻城奪地强佔道路的兇惡。不過×人的戰鬥力，每一次最高度的發揮（有如此次之不惜重大犧牲攻佔南昌）則其戰鬥力降落之速度亦必愈激趨劇，再加×人政治上經濟上和外交上困難的日益嚴重，終必誘導×人走向總崩潰之路。但是，如果不加上我們軍事上政治上經濟上外交上尤其是民力總動員上的進步，不在目前階段予×人以更大的打擊，則當×人戰鬥力高度發揮，實行軍事冒險，並且配合分化分裂妥協調解的政治陰謀之時；我們抗戰就要受到重大的影響，我們民族解放事業的成功前途便要更加遼遠，而其進程中之艱苦危險，更非吾人所敢想像！</p>
<p>據目前抗戰的這些特點，我們在今日必須加緊政治上經濟上外交上尤其是民力總動員上的進步，多方面的沉重的予×人以打擊。特別重要的是要從速集中全民族精神上的物質上的力量，來堅持團結堅持抗戰爭取勝利，而所賴於海外僑胞之努力的，尤爲異常重大。各地僑胞自祖國抗戟全面展開以來，莫不熱烈擁護，有錢出錢，有力出力，較諸前綫將士及戰區同胞之艱苦奮鬥慷慨犧牲，雖仍未可同日而語，但其爲國難而犧牲爲祖國而献身的精神，實佔中國抗戰史上最光榮之一頁。</p>
<p>連日本港各報刋載消息，謂各地僑胞專門技術人才，最近紛粉聯合囘國効命，卽以昨晚所得消息而言南洋各地惠州同僑救鄉會組織的「東江華僑囘鄉服務團」兩團，已於本日廿四日啓程囘國，柔佛新山籌賑會組織的「司機囘國服務團」，第三批亦經訓練期滿，於本日廿四日啓程囘國；又柔佛「太平機工囘國服務團」四十二人，亦於同日出檳城轉輪來港囘國，此外如麻六甲，文冬，森華，及新加披等埠華僑，拋棄職業，組織囘國服務團，爲祖國抗戰而投効的，均已相繼準備，不日亦可啓程囘國服務。其他未見報載及正在準備中的，更不知凡幾！</p>
<p>各地僑胞這種義勇愛國的舉動，一方面表現出我國政府堅持團結抗戰建國的國策，完全適合於全中國人民爭獨立爭自由的共同要求，對於一切企圖以反共和平來煽亂人心的漢奸叛徒，則爲一種無情的打擊。另一方面亦可向全世界人士表現我中華民族至高無上的偉大精神，增强了國際正義和平人類對於我國抗戰必勝建國必成的信心。</p>
<p>我國政府對於歡迎僑胞囘國服務，已經先後公佈許多法令，我們祈望政府今後能够再加切實的獎勵，並且帮助僑胞們解决許多切身的問題，如參加抗×救亡工作的自由，生活及其家庭經濟的保障等；同時我們還要祈望於同胞的：</p>
<p>第一是祈望各地僑胞對於囘國服務的團體或個人，應該舉行熱烈的歡送或榮譽大會，並且以團體及輿論向回國服務僑胞的家屬表示尊敬，舉行經常的慰問，協助其解决各種問題。</p>
<p>第二是祈望國內及接近祖國地方的同胞。當囘國服務的僑胞過境之時，舉行盛大的歡迎會歡送會和榮譽會等等羣衆大會。並且用各民衆團體廣大羣衆的力量，協力帮助囘國服務的僑胞，迅速切實解决其沿途可能發生的問題。我們要使每一個决心囘國服務的僑胞，當其踏進祖國之後，能和囘到久別重逢的慈母懷裏一般親密，愉快，興奮！</p>
<p>第三，也是特別重要的，祈望富有的僑胞，以及未能立卽囘國服務的僑胞，應該加緊擴大募捐運動還債運動義賣運動，以及一切適應祖國當前的急需與有助於中華民族解放事業的經濟運動。至於投資祖國開發西南西北富源，發展後方經濟建設，是奠定未來建立新中國的重大任務，更需要有遠見的各界僑胞之努力，尤其是輿論界敎育界，要加緊努力促其普遍切實的實現。</p>
<p>華僑對於世界正義和平事業，早曾創建光榮的史頁：對於祖國革命建國事業，更曾創建偉大而不朽的榮譽，今當决定中華民族生死存亡、抗日戰爭嚴重階段，我華僑的努力，便越發顯得重要了！加緊鞭策我們自己吧！祖國的光明幸福的前途，正等待着我們去開闢啊！</p>
<h3>冀南平原抗日根据地的建立</h3>
<p>【華北通訊】從和順出發，翻過了艱險崔嵬的太行山，繞出了峋屈曲的羊陽，就下到平坦無垠的河北平原，縱橫南北的平漢綫就在那裏橫臥着，這條已經被×人佔領了的交通綫，現在已經不能像先前似地寧靜地橫臥着了，我們潛伏在鉄道附近的冀西游擊隊，和一部份的某路軍經常地出沒　常地，把它摧毀得七零八落，首尾不接，使它坐臥不寧失掉了正常的作用，我們的游擊隊。一天往往要出發許幾次，每一次都是把鐵路毫不容情的破壞，復又安然地帶着勝利的微笑返囘來　我們的部隊工作人員，也是每天從鐵路　側，穿梭似的來往　，在　西只要雕開鐵路兩里地以外，×人就無法統治，實際上，就是對於這僅有的交通綫，也是束手無策，相反地，却在我們游擊隊的統制下。</p>
<p>冀南冀中這塊廣澳的平原地區，它包括的地區，北起滄石路，南全冀豫邊境，東迄魯邊，西迄平漢綫，有大小二十餘縣，可是自從去年我軍退出以後，就成了無人管無人問的地區，羣　依然模模糊糊過着他們『恬靜」的生活，什麽政權軍隊民衆組織全都沒有，同時×人也沒有顧得及來佔有，不過她對於這塊廣大的地區，是從來沒有絲毫忘懷過的，她收買看大批漢奸匪徒，潛入各地大施活動，組織什麽會，各式各樣的團體，來　　欺　我落後羣衆，尤其是在靠近山東邊境一帶，這種　總勢力一直到現在還居然相當的大，在南宮東北棗强武邑大營等縣，簡直成了他們的大本營，漢奸活動的根据地。因爲這些地方接近津浦綫，他們都有民間原有的武裝，運用封建迷信的關係，在我們政權軍隊退出以後，爲了保護身家，自動地糾合起來以「刀槍不入」等等口號，號召落後羣衆參加，同時漢奸匪徒也就乘機大肆活躍，以「不抗日保家鄉」「反共不反日』，』不抗日不反蔣」等反動口號從中欺騙麻醉，雖然自本年三月間，某路軍果進縱隊橫　過去以後，各種工作隨着也開展起來，我們在那平原地帶，開始建立了抗日政權發動，並組織了絮衆，和地方武裝，開展了廣大的平原游擊戰爭，可是會門的勢力却並不因此而稍形削弱，却相反地隨着我們工作的展開而愈益龐大起來，其原因是在於：（一）羣衆工作還不够深入普通，（二）當時冀南行政主任公署所頒佈「公平負担」的辦法，在執行上曾經引起了富有者的誤會，造成了　富的對立，有些富戶就結合會門或參加會門來反對這一辦法，（三）因爲冀南爲棉花出產地，人民每年收入的大宗，×人以重價大量收買，冀南行政公署爲了抵制起見，會下令禁棉花出境，當時正値棉花上市，冀南防禦大量棉花出口，因此引起了人民重大反感，被漢好匪徒操　着的會門，他就趁勢以「抗日反共』來欺騙羣衆，號召羣衆，羣衆受惑竟有不少被利用</p>
<p>此終于在十一月初爆發了「棗强事件」因爲當時棗强「白吉會」勢力相當龐大，份子尤爲複雜，憑藉以上幾點理由公開煽動羣衆，並與「皇協軍』勾結反對政府反對某路軍，企圖顯覆政府解决某路軍，駐在談縣某路軍一部，早思有以對付，同時河北省政府也鑒于棗强漢奸勢力過大，派隊前來凖備將「白吉會」解决，「白吉會」爲先發制人，先我　聚會衆千餘人，把城團團　住，實行攻城，並禁止我城外部隊進城，我軍爲爭取受欺編羣衆，姑不還　，並以「中國人不打中國人」，「不要受日本帝國主義和漢奸的利用』等口號進行　傳爭取工作，　　聞　自動走散者數百人，惟仍有少數企圖頑抗，因此發生武裝　　，死傷不少，</p>
<p>經過了政隊不斷的與漢奸匪徒搏博鬥與能耐的對羣衆的宣傳，救　工作經過了這一次的武裝衝突會門勢力逐　開始消淡下去，有些部分給爭取瓦解了，有些部分被收編爲現在的地方武裝——蓬游擊隊了，在最初的時候。這些收緬來的游擊隊，還大批大批的投向「皇協軍」，就是現在這種現象依然還不斷發生着，他們公開反對抗日政府，反對某路軍，在那偏僻的地方——如棗强武道一帶，會門與軍隊政府的對立，仍　還沒有完全消除，這還需要着我們不斷的努力！</p>
<p>在冀南軍事政治中心的南宮一帶各種救亡工作都比較開展，不過越往遠走，就越加比較薄弱，羣衆組織，雖然自從像工救會，農救會，婦救會與靑年組織大致都已組織起來，並且都已有了冀南總的領導機關；不過在下曆基礎上，依然椒不够的，因爲組織的開展，由於種種關係，都採取由上而下的方式開展起來的，時時　沒有經過深入普遍的敎育工作，和嚴密的組織生活，譬如從任縣經距鹿到南宮這一百八十多里的路上，經過不少的村落城鎭，都沒有自衞隊站　，不過只是形式上的，對于行人不加査問就都放過了，據說他們都是有錢人出錢僱來替他們站崗的；難怪他們這樣疏忽於自身砷聖的任務，同時也因此可見這些地方下層羣衆工作是怎樣不够，需要着怎樣更大更深入的努力里</p>
<p>政權在冀南十數縣，是統一在「冀南行政主任公署」的領導下的，行政　　已經經過了相當的改革，對于戰時各種新法令的訂定，執行都還有相當成績，　如動員新戰士優待家屬，公平負担，禁棉出口等　法令之執行，起初雖然曾經或多或少地遭受羣衆的反對，但經過了深入的宣傳敎育工作以後，現在羣衆們都是很樂意地在執行着了·</p>
<p>當廣州武渙失守以前，冀南冀中已不是一個平靜無事的地方了，爲了配合戰場的戰事　　應新的戰鬥任務迎接×人「　　」華北的新形勢，在冀南　軍政民三位一體的緊密合作下發動了一個緊急戰門動員的號召，這一個號召發出後，整個冀南好像打了一針強心劑似的地　　起來了，大家以南宮為中心基　，廣泛地動員民衆拆城破路，空舍淸野………冀南工會農會婦救會和靑年團體，都全體動員了起來，婦救會的女同志們，她們担任督促工作，監督拆城，每天總是要到深夜才能回來，第二天又就一早出去，在武漢失守前幾天，×人以一千多兵力進攻任縣，於佔領邢家　（任縣東北）以後，被我某路軍和良衆包圍起來，經二天的苦戰全部解决以後，更鼓舞了人們高度的工作熱忱，南宮的城　就在十幾天內給刷平了，部隊也忙着調理，戰士們都興奮地等待著新的更殘酷的戰鬥的到來，</p>
<p>十一月中旬×人二千餘人裝滿汽車一百多輛從邢台內　浩浩蕩蕩　將出來，企圖十冀南作大舉的進攻，東面山東　城一帶也展開了激烈的戰門，×人企圖從　東西兩路來　　南宮，十一月十六日×人迫近南宮，離　門五十餘里，午後四時，南宮城裏所有的民衆都撤退了，一切能搬走的東西用具，也都　走了，南宮城差不多成了一座空城，工救　救婦　及某某（靑年組織）等四個羣衆團體和某路軍　　部是等大家走完了，於晚間十一點多鐘也最後撤退的，在太行山裏雖然打了一年多的游擊戰，可是這平原游擊生活，却是第一遭的嘗試，前面又是一片走不盡的平地，×人的坦克車，裝甲車，耀武威地施展着它們的淫威，大家自己背着行李連走兩晝夜，毫沒休息，第三天到達威縣繼續又向廣宗進發，一路退一路做着工作。</p>
<p>南宮城於十七日被×人進佔，×人進城以後，看到只是一座空城，×××××××××××××，十八日城內大火，而我們的游擊宇蟄伏在城外毫無動　，十九日早晨×人四十多輛汽車切　　它安全地向西南　去，可是一到晚間我們城外的游擊隊自衛隊都展開了他們通神的威力，先把城周圍的道路完全澈底地破壤了，城內殘餘的×人都給團團解决，作爲冀南平原根　地的中心的南宮，就這樣地又奔向我們的手中來了。</p>
<p>×人向這平原抗日根據地的大舉圍攻計劃，終於在冀南民衆配合軍隊軍政民三位一體的嚴密團結英勇奮門下，完全給粉碎了，當×人沒有進攻，這地還相對加平靜無事的時候，軍政之間存着許多不必要的「磨　」，可是　　了×人這次進攻，這種「親者痛　者快』的現象都已經逐漸地消除了，這是我們應該感謝×人的·</p>
<p>冀南冀中這塊平原抗日根据地是這樣的建立起來了，今後的問題是怎樣來鞏固它發展它，使它在堅持華北抗戰，堅持持久戰，和中華民族　　解放的過程中發揮它應有的　略作用了。</p>
<h3>激漲着的中歐反德怒潮</h3>
<p>（特譯稿）　　與吞倂了捷克後，希特勒又在發　　兇狠的新陰謀了。他的陰謀在於中歐，東默的絕對刦持，中歐一切國家和部分領土的掠奪，以及積　籌劃着向西歐列强和蘇聯進攻，但在北歐，德國正在積極準備呑併克拉配德（Kloipedo），控制立陶宛，這裏「蘇台區的經驗」整個搬用着。</p>
<p>在德國法西斯唆使下，捷克和匈牙利間的磨擦。大爲增强。德國法西斯，，以前曾經在波匈疆界問題上挑撥波蘭。匈牙利間的爭執：曾經為滿足匈牙利的　求而犧牲斯洛伐克和阿爾巴阡烏克蘭的南部土地，現在又公開聲稱支持斯洛　克，推　維也納的决定。同時，它又在指使斯洛洛伐克反對波蘭。德國也用盡了一切方法惡化波蘭和羅馬尼亞的邦交·在巴爾幹半島，希特勒的走卒正在煽動民族間的仇恨，鼓勵打破原狀的要求，使這些國家民換彼此互相攻擊，</p>
<p>很明顯的，中歐和東歐的任何一個單獨的國家反抗希特勒的壓迫的力量太弱小了，希特勒德國的壓迫，只有用集體力量才能抵抗，這一認識已影　了那些國家的人民甚至頑固和落後的份子·在這些國家中最大的一國，—波蘭—已起了無數呼籲，呼　聯合中歌的侵略。最値得大書特書的：這些呼籲是從那些在去年十月間發動支解捷克的份子叫出來的：自然，今天波蘭所處的困境，他們自己應該負部分的責任。波　天主敎領袖克爾方泰曾經寫過：『今天只有極少數的波蘭人還不自己承認：破壞捷克堡壘的慕尼黑陰謀已在基本上改變了國際形勢和波蘭的重要性。』卽使些法西斯的走卒，昨天還是希特勒的崇拜者和慕尼黑協定的搖旗吶喊人，今天却恍然了德申區之割讓給波蘭乃是波蘭政治上的大失　。</p>
<p>著名的右翼領袖，斯屈龍斯基直接建議建立一個『反抗希特勒野心的中歐同盟』，他說：</p>
<p>「雖然東歐鄰近德國的國家沒有一個有力量單獨地抵制德國侵略，保衛自己；但若是它們聯台在一起——巴爾幹國家，波蘭·捷克，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫——却可以向德國這麽說：我們都　意和德國友好，但我們不能坐視我們中一個一個遭受德國之控制，統治·因之，我們聯合一致抵抗任何這樣的企圖；這是很明白的，德國在中歐勢力的抬頭，就是我們眞正獨立吿終·』</p>
<p>斯屈龍斯基敎授明白指出：這樣一個聯盟將大大的增强了那些在希特勒便略威脅下的各國的抵抗力。實際情形，上述各國的人口總數一共是九千五百萬，若是加入保加利亞計算，總數可以超過一萬萬，　德國的人口多得多。其次，這些國家有着極其重要的，有些具有很大的軍事價値的原料；這些原料現在不斷輸到德國去，而德國如果缺少它們是不能打仗的。這些原料是：羅馬尼亞的石油，波蘭，羅馬尼亞和南斯拉夫的榖類，肉　，木材等。</p>
<p>尤其重要的是：在抵抗國外侵略的戰爭中，中間性的小國家的軍紀一定會此被驅使着去侵佔別國領土，破壞別國獨立的德國軍隊的　紀要激昂得多。但在這裏最重要的是像這樣一倜聯盟，必然受着渴望和平的人民和國家的擁護。更不必說，像這樣一個聯盟必然會得到和平的堡壘，蘇聯的支持的，由于這原因，玫關力泰，就對蘇波關係之增進，表示了無限的歡迎。</p>
<p>中歐和東南歐的人民和政治家現在都已認瞰了；</p>
<p>「任何國家，凡眞正願意在慕尼黑協定造成的局勢下鞏固它的安全的，必須認蘇聯做爲一個保衞和平的有力因索，並且可以將它的援助估量在內』。（一九三八年十一月份蘇　消息報）</p>
<p>不必說，這聯盟與以前波蘭外長貝克企圖組織的所謂「中立聯盟』完全不同，那是受人指使，危害弱小民族獨立和危害蘇聯的。</p>
<p>自然，中歐東南歐國家協約的前途還不　有着一些大的困難和障礙。第一，這些國家　存在着統治階　的反動的出　國家的　　策，而它們在這　國家的政策上常是居着重大的或是决定的作用。第二，這裏還存在着這些國家中反動政府和各階層的對立，舊的和新的領土糾葛，復土運動等等。反動叛徒們的政策實在是一個可怕的，但不是不能克服的障礙。現在，卽使波蘭的反動政府也已不得不去增善和蘇聯比　係了。它是被波蘭人民的奮鬥和那些資產階級所加的壓　逼得如此做的：然而波蘭社會中的叛徒們却還不相信與希特勒合作和參與分割捷克已經重重地　害了波蘭的獨立·中歐東南歐國家像波蘭同樣情形的還有。但同時，這裏勞動大衆的壓力在大步地生長着，卽使在資產階級圈不裏，對德國關係的意見之轉變也可以見到。</p>
<p>說到目前各國的關係，我們可以從下面看出：波蘭的掠奪者在捷克引起了極大的仇恨。　蘇波關係改進的第一個消息却已使捷克的輿論立刻有了改變。毫無疑義，反抗德國在中默控制勢力的摧毀將給予這些國家的外交或內政政策之民主化以一個有力的推動，並且極有助於　當解决它們彼此間的要求和爭執。它將加速提高些國家人民，戰勝其本國反動勢力的勝利。一等到這些國家裏的人民團結起來時，它們將根據國家和平的民主原則解决一切外交內政上爭執的問題，因此爲保衞他們的主權和獨立，抵抗法西侵略者聯盟的中間性的小國聯盟　義。正日益受歡迎着。這個有着友好的隣國關係，和蘇聯，以及一切渴求和平和獨立國家合作的聯盟將成爲　　和平的一個有力因素。（克勞多夫斯基原作，朔望　）</p>
<h3>援華運動在荷蘭</h3>
<p>（特　　V，O，）在荷蘭，世界語是相當普選的，尤其在一般勞動　　之間，所以用世界語向荷蘭作國際宣傅，確能得到願　的成效，自從中國的世界　宣　刊物「東方呼聲」出版以後，在許多國家得到很大的反響，荷蘭也是其中之一，荷蘭的世界語者經常把「東方呼聲」上的材料成荷蘭又刊登在各種報紙上，並且紛紛寫信來表示同情，寄捐款來支持。但他們覺得不够，還願意替中國開抗戰展覽會來進一步激起荷蘭民眾對中國的同情，「東方呼聲」答應了他們的要求，寄了一些照片（大部份由國際宣傳處及中央社所供給），他們就把這少數照片開了好幾次展覽會，獲得了滿意的收穫。最近，那裏的一位熱心，界語者寫信給「東方呼聲」，報吿展覽經過，信中充滿着兄弟般親切的感情讀之使人奮感·這裏把它譯載於下：</p>
<p>「東方呼聲」社諸位同志，去年承供給各種關於中國抗戰的照片八十餘幀，在此已展覽多次，其成績超出希望。　詳述如左，也許是你們所樂聞的：</p>
<p>第一次，在我們的團體「荷蘭工人世界語者協會」第九支部內舉行·</p>
<p>第二次，在同團體第十支部舉行，當時有蘭格同志熱烈的同情演講，此君為我從前所不認職的。</p>
<p>第三次、在荷蘭製　職工會南方支部E·m·m·內舉行。這次展覽有重大的意義，因該支部曾在荷蘭援華運動委員會的領導之下，派出許多　款人員，參加本城募欵運動，成績超過一萬二千盾（合國幣四萬餘元）。</p>
<p>第四次、在向蘭民眾文化協會的大　內各　教育班內舉行。</p>
<p>第五次，在阿媽斯屯（荷京）鬧市的一家書店的門窗內輪流陳列，以後我們還想在別的商店內陳列。</p>
<p>第六次，在柴門霍夫誕辰（世界語創造者生於十二月十五日】紀念時。在克拉斯那普爾斯基大厦舉行展覽，這次展覽收獲極大的成功，有九百多人來參觀，他們的對於中國抗戰的關心是極其可驚的。査此次我們賣去三十一册援華委員會的小册子，六十份「東方呼聲』，如果我們有更多的份數，當然也可以賣掉的。最後我們在門口募捐，募得十餘　，都送到中國領事館轉寄貴國政府</p>
<p>我們的成績可說是十分使人滿意的。以前，我們協會的幹部，對於找們的計劃，毫不贊同，在這次展覽會中，他們完全取旁觀態度。起初我們以及參加着的援華會的代表們，都不許演說幾句，以促起公衆對我們展覽會的注會。但後來終於因　起了人們的興趣，於是當局者也允准我們募集捐欵，售賣小册子和刊物了。大　對於中國的同情心是活躍的，但如不加以繼續刺激，則仍是停滯的。</p>
<p>最後，我們之得到成功，不得不感謝許多活動的男女同志們帮助·</p>
<p>我們做了許多美麗的宣傳布幕，黏上照片，襯以美術卡紙與各色花邊·我們請　案家　上　多　目的字句。所有材料都經細心佈置，非常美觀。我們又從援華會借來十三張照片，你們的照片之中，有幾張因爲太模糊或因裸體，沒有採用·</p>
<p>你們來信說要把這些照片帶到法國去。但是這裏，這些照片似乎還有許多用處·不祗在阿姆斯屯，在別的城市也可以利用的。不久之後，我們預備去訪問別的團體，舉行展展覽，作宣傅演說，以促醒對中國的同情，推銷「東方呼聲』，並與援華會合作。他們可以表現中國跳舞，音樂與留聲機片，其結果將更深刻，我們還覺得需要一些價廉而切用的有畫的小册子，也許你們也可以供給我們。動人的招貼，如西班牙世界語者所印行的，也很有用。你們可否供給點給此　中國人用的中文課本？我們還須要許多照片，不　關於戰爭的，要關於中國整個文化，風習，自然風景，交通，婦女與孩子們的進步活動，關於學校，體育，藝術以及中國要人等等的照片。這些照片不要比明信片更人。因爲我們有一套幻燈噐具，在把這裏的照片寄到別處法時，我們可以用來一邊演講，中國音樂，唱歌和名人演說的留聲片也極有效果，也希望你們可以供給一些。其費用一定可以取回來的。你們可以印一些有標語的明信片。如你們有別的意見，請通知我們，我們極願加以攷慮與實踐的。</p>

<h3>西部公路建設</h3>
<p>— 璧岑</p>
<p>飛躍發展大部完成　國際通路又關六條</p>
<p>【昆明特約航訊】公路的建設，比較鐵路容易得多了。因爲公路所需材料，大部爲國產而多土石工程，所以就目前來說，我國公路要比較鐵路容易發展。現在西南西北兩大公路綱，已經大部完，這在鐵路網沒有完成以前，實在是對內對外，相當捷便的交通工具。</p>
<p>在西南方面、戰前已完成的公路就有二萬七千餘公里，戰爭發生到現在，又完成了不少路綫。目前計有：（一）成渝公路，從成都經過資陽，資中，榮昌到重慶，長約四百五十公里。（二）川　公路，從貴陽經過遵義，桐梓到重慶，長約五百公里。（三）滇黔公路，從昆明經平彝到貴陽，長約六百餘公里，與川黔成　兩路相接，可達重慶成都。（四）川滇公路（叙昆公路），從四川的叙州到昆明，現正在趕工修築，而宣威至威寧一段，已經完成，全路不久卽可通車。（五）滇緬公路，從昆明起，經過下關，永昌，龍陵，孟餘而至臘戌。自昆明至下關一段，共長二百七十五英哩，在三年前早就通車了，其餘下關至　戍的三百四十餘英哩，前年十二月開始修榮，現在已經完成了。這條路的修築，設計家完全是中國人，工作方面，完全和用人力，幾乎沒有運用過一架最簡單的機噐，所以倫敦泰晤士報的訪員說：『所完成的，是極優良的工作，唯有中國人才能做到那地步」。這條路的完成，使中英交通，縮短了不少的時間，從昆明到緬甸，最多五天，就可以到達了。（六）湘　公路，從湖南長沙經黃縣至貴陽。（七）湘桂公路，從衡陽經零陵到桂林。（八）川桂公路，從柳州經貴陽，而達重慶或成都。（九）川湘公路，從常德經過沅陵，而達涪陵或重慶，（十）桂越公路，從柳州經邕寧，達鎭南關和安南的諒山相通。（十一）陝　公路，從陜西　　，經成都而　　定，這是西南西北惟一聯絡路線。此外尙有桂間，川都以及省　間的公路，不勝枚　。</p>
<p>在西北方面，除陜康公路聯絡西南外，以　　爲中心　：（一）西蘭公路，自皋蘭經定西，隆德，平凉至西安，全長七百公里，路面舖有石子，行車十分便利。（二）甘新公路，自皋蘭經永登，古浪，永昌，酒泉，玉門，出猩猩峽，再經哈密迪化而達塔城，全長二千八百公里，和蘇聯的中亞細亞相通，爲我國西北惟一國際交通線，同時從皋　到酒泉的一段，沿途都是物產最豐富的區域。（三）甘川公路，從西蘭公路的華家嶺起，經過通渭，天水，武都而達四川的廣元，和陜　公路相接，長約七百公里。（四）　　公路，從陜西鳳翔到　蘭，長四百餘公里。（五）甘寧公路，從臬蘭經靖遠而　寧夏，長約三百八十公里，可惜因爲綏省的淪陷×手，未能興工條築。（六）甘靑公路，從皋蘭到西寧，長約二百八十公里，工程浩大，目前尙未修築。（七）陜綏公路，從西安或咸陽經過三原，洛川川，膚施，楡林而達緩遠，所經膚施延長一帶，是八路軍大本營所在的地方，×人自從侵據山西以後，雖然時常企圖渡河西　，而不得逞，實在是受八路軍不斷予以慘痛打華的原因。延長石油蘊藏，又很　富，可惜仍未利用新法開採，最近交通　爲增進西南西北各路的運輸效率起見，會通令各路局各公司，積極改善路面，修築橋樑，並增添車輛，擴充修理廠，儲　自製配件，盡量採用國產代用品，以期减少外匯的流出。</p>
<p>總之，抗戰的洪流使我國的一切事業，都有長足的進步了，尤其是在交通建設方面。我們從上邊簡短的叙述中，已經可以看出一個大槪，西甫西北鐵路網，雖然還正在建築中，沒有完成，但已有公路，航運，電訊，水運，馱　　來補助。將來一旦修築完竣，不但西南西北蘊藏豐富的一切富源可藉以開發，而增强我們長期抗戰中取不盡用不竭的物力和財力的來源；同時國際交通，又被我們開出六條路線：一可由　明出仰光；二可由昆明出海門；三可由柳州出海防；四可由泉蘭出土耳其斯担；五可由皋蘭經西土鐵路而達北歐；六可由　倫經西伯里亞大鐵路而與蘇聯的莫　科海參戚相呼應。日×自從侵華以來，用了九牛二虎之力，企圖封鎖我們的海岸族，有的是力量，有的是辦法。</p>
<h3>我向美廠訂購大批飛機　加強空軍實力　新合同已成立</h3>
<p>【美聯社哈德佛廿七日電】據悉，中國政府頃已獲得一千五百萬元之信用祖保、向美國聯合飛機公司、購買怕特惠型飛機、中國大使館參事、對此表示、幷不知情、美國商業界人士認爲，此項協定、爲確的其事、亦完全爲私人性質、與政府絕無關係、據兩可靠方面稱、該消息完全屬實、唯一切進行、或乃在中國進行者、</p>

<h3>廣東政治的新途徑　（三）</h3>
<p>— 李育中</p>
<p>韻關特約通訊</p>
<p>五　民衆組織是否健全</p>
<p>廣東自衛　的優點、首先是有普遍的組織，有些地方還成立「特務總隊」成爲模範的基本部隊，最明顯的戰區自衞團，已經英勇地執行保衞家鄉　逐×人的戰鬥、但弱點仍多：（一）領導機關不健全，領導人物不够賢　。（二）組織不嚴密，許多組織只有名無實。（三）一般的自衞團、只取强制軍事敎訓、政治訓練都特別缺乏。（四）民衆把自衞團當作　兵看待，以爲參加自衛團就是當兵，他們對政府不信任、（五）自衞團組織的名目繁多、使職責不專一，造成這些弱點的原因：一、是拉夫式攤派式的動員，而不是政治的動員。二。軍事和政洽的負責訓練的幹，部質和量都不够。</p>
<p>乙　如何革新廣東政治</p>
<p>一、政治方面</p>
<p>（一）怎樣使政治配合軍事</p>
<p>政府方面：（一）要表示堅决領導抗戰到底，肅淸一切動搖份子、鞏固抗日民族統一戰綫。（二）實行抗戰中的民權主義，尤其是實現抗戰建國綱領，予人民各種自由；建立各級參政會、帮助和推動抗戰運動的展開，樹立民主政治的基礎。（三）肅淸在政治上的陰謀，蓄意破壞軍民合作，挑撥民衆與政府的對立的漢奸。（四）建立黨政軍與民意機關經常聯系的組織。（五）好好的運用知識靑年，深入農村工作。（六）對貧民難民給以救濟，組織和敎育。（七）盡可能改善人民生活。（八）肅淸貪污。（九）加强公務人員的政治敎育。（十）改善乓役制度，逐漸取消拉夫方式。（十一）剷除宮僚習氣。</p>
<p>軍隊方面：（一）加强士兵的政治敎育、特別是建立軍隊中的自覺紀律、提高民族意識。（二）實行軍民公約，先從軍隊中做起。（三）加強瓦解×偽工作。（四）改革與充實軍事和政治敎育，使適應抗戰需要。（五）提高政工人員地位，建立政治部的威信，洗刷過去把政訓員當賣膏藥者的觀念。（六）要政訓員同時是戰鬥員，軍事長官應該是軍隊政治規條的模範實踐者。（七）軍政兩方面人員需取得密切　系，部隊里的政治食議，軍事長官須到席參加，軍事會議，政工人員也如是。</p>
<p>人民方面：（一）竭誠擁護政府，抗戰到底，堅决執行政府法令，積極參加抗戰工作。（二）實行節約，積極生產，充實抗戰力量。（三）維持後方治安。（四）自動除奸。（五）對政府不要提過多要求，要在抗戰中幫助政府克服一切困難。（六）知識靑年應自動深入農村，起刻苦耐勞的範模作用。（未完）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>「西戰結束」</h3>
<p>『西班矛戰事正式結束』！</p>
<p>資本主義各國都已發出這樣的電訊。</p>
<p>侵略國家的德意首腦，更是賀電紛傳。</p>
<p>共和軍在國際陰謀和叛徒出賣下，被迫投降。法西斯叛軍進佔馬德里和瓦倫西亞，西班牙戰事表面上確是結束了。</p>
<p>然而表面的暫時的結束，却不是西班牙問題的解决。</p>
<p>我們不想預測西班牙再有大戰，我們也希望西班牙全國從此團結，收拾破碎的山河，排除侵略的勢力，重造自由的國家。可惜，沒有根據的希望祗是夢想！祗是自欺欺人！</p>
<p>我們瞧吧！西班牙人民爲什麽堅决支持了這次反法西斯反侵略的戰爭？豈不是爲求西班牙人民大衆的解放和維護世界的和平嗎？如果是的，那麽現在德意兩個侵略魔王。是不是願意白白領導及帮助佛朗哥打了三十個月的仗而就此退出西班牙呢？現在的佛朋哥政權是否可算是眞正西班牙人的政權、而能稍稍違反其主子德意兩國的意旨呢？佛朗哥政權是否能够離開外國資產階級政府的操縱，而眞正謀求西班牙及其人民的獨立自由幸福呢？如果我們不能肯定答覆這些問題，則我們希望西戰眞正結束，豈不是夢想？</p>
<p>我們堅信：西班牙的人民大衆，過去鬥爭着。現在鬥爭着，以至今後亦必繼續爲西班牙獨立自由幸福而奮鬥，直到叛徒法西斯及侵略勢力全部肅淸爲止—</p>
<p>我們不僅不應冷眼旁觀西班牙人民的慘被出賣！我們還要謹記西班牙血淚的經驗敎訓，謹月漢奸叛徒侵略者和其他一切準備犧牲我二十個防抗戰成就的妥協調解的陰謀！</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>中華民族優秀的兒女：金山，王瑩會見記</p>
<p>王瑩一席動人心坎的談話</p>
<p>訪問他們的其他客人走了，金林二先生就從會客室邀記者到他們的房間，亦是他們的臨時辦事去會晤王瑩女士。</p>
<p>「跳出黑暗的電影圈」到日本留學的王瑩女士，我們早已敬佩她，不僅是一個明星，而且是一個意識前進的新女性。年來在×人炮火下艱辛地工作，她已經不愧爲民族解放的鬬士了。晤見了她，從她的態度，言詞的表現，越是顯示中華民族的靈魂，原是寄托在這優秀的中華民族的兒女身上的。</p>
<p>介紹之后，王女士就熱情地，溫和地、眞摯地，樂觀地，吿訴記者：</p>
<p>『中國的進步，眞是快極了！要不是爲了抗戰，三十年，四十年，還是換不來這空前的進步！』</p>
<p>王女士很輕聲而親切地，打開話匣，絲毫不是宣傳家的故意強調，而是親身經歷的眞憑實據：</p>
<p>那眞是難得極了！隨軍服務的很多，靑年，他們克服過去優裕的生活習慣，衣服很隨便，飮食亦很簡單，佔領著他們腦子里的只有祖國的復興，而沒有一刻的休息生活在。</p>
<p>王女士越是起勁地說：</p>
<p>『軍民打成一片的現象亦是越來越使人感奮；老百姓讓出房間給軍隊住，還替他們幹種種的工作。靑年男女，或是老太婆，小孩子到軍隊裏面去看他們，帮忙他們，跟他們生活，簡直就是一家人。</p>
<p>『記得是在新建拗的地方，那裏的地主豪紳階級的舊勢力很大。我們開展工作的時候，就誠懇地對他們說：你們不同意的事情，我們就不幹。我們是來替老百姓服務的，沒有絲毫的成見。地主們看了我們的工作計劃，同情我們了，允許鄕民來看我們的戲了，從四鄉湧上來的一下就是幾千人。他們看戲看得入神，上了癮，就從家裏背了白米，看戲後，就在演劇的曠場煮飯吃。晚間還在檯前露宿，有的是在戲檯下面睡着。這樣一連演了幾夜他們都非常感動。有一位地主自動登台演講，態度的進步，眞是出乎我們意料之外。很多老百姓看戲後就詰問我們：你們演的這些究竟是眞的呢？還是假的呢？我們就用×人姦淫，擄掠，轟炸，搶殺，的像片給他們看。有的女人掩着眼睛不願再看下去，衆口同聲，咀咒着：天地間怎有這些沒天良的××××，要是他來，那還和他客氣嗎？一定要把他打個你死我活的。』</p>
<p>——記者聽到這裏，眞是深深受其感動。王女士的唇間，眉梢，還是刻劃着得意的神情，滔滔地說：</p>
<p>『我們抓住這個機會，就着了老百姓一樣的衣服，分頭訪問去。巷他們割稻，帮他們洗衣，很自然地從他們的實生活中向他們宣傳。老百姓眞是可愛極了！我們要不是親上前線與深入窮鄉僻壤，就不能瞭解眞正的中國，就不能確信中國一定有光榮的前途，最後勝利，是絕無疑義的』——他們的堅决的信念與工作的態度，實在是値得一般救亡工作者取法的。</p>
<p>『凡是我們經過的地方，×人就在後面追着。在新建拗的礮聲由遠而近，而響徹的當兒，我們才離開到他處工作，該地雖失守，老百姓與自銜軍一齊起來打游擊，成績非常良好。大地主有的是土地田園，一經淪陷，亦赤貧如平一樣，所以地主與農民，都親密地，聯合起來和×人拚命。使×人受到重大的威脅。</p>
<p>『抗戰，的的確確是一面在新生，一面在燬滅。凡是腐敗，落後的制度，人物。都在炮火中消滅了！</p>
<p>王女士說到這裏，加重了語氣，格外地興奮，記者亦報以會心的微笑，</p>
<p>『我們奔走了這一年多來，自己覺得很有進步，我們是非常快慰，非常樂觀的。」</p>
<p>聽了王女士一席動人心坎的談話，我們在感奮祖國的進步中，更慚愧我們自己的工作，自己的生活，還是遠遠距離祖國神聖的抗戰。</p>
<p>聽說本港文化界戲劇界將熱烈舉行歡迎會，藉表慰勞的盛意，幷溝通祖團與國外的文化交流，記者還欲寄話本港向上的靑年男女，多多親近他們，他們領敎，對於自己是一個吸收與學習的絕好機會　（完）</p>

<h3>淪陷後的大良</h3>
<p>— 少敏</p>
<p>爲了採訪淪陷區的新聞、和調査同胞的狀况、决定跑去陷落未久的順德大良、</p>
<p>本月廿六日淸晨、匆忙地打點着化裝的工作、細心檢査身上什物一過、總以不令×人認出我　記者爲原則、心頭有點異樣、但是出動時的步伐、却特別　鬆、又爲了避免×人的疑惑、從白蓮市　了一艘採蓮般的小舟、這舟、于是載着我這个土老兒、渡過沙頭、硬着頭皮望岸邊駛、喝一聲、×兵過來盤査、幸而土老兒裝着恭順地、偷進了第一度門隘、</p>
<p>沿中順公路、邁步進發、公路的行人、除我和三五個沒精打彩的×哨兵外、連一個影子也再不能抓出來、步行一小時、才抵達大良的城裏、爲了沒有良民證　的係、又經了多少留難、侮辱、但、入大良後記者所目擊淪陷區的同胞們、受盡了比我所遇更厲害的侮辱多着呢、這不是自慰、而是吿訴給全國同胞、</p>
<p>江本、原田、福田、這三個×部隊、分別佔據一個地段、也就是×人分別抽收烟賭規的世界、江本部隊佔了公　附近的廖心石的住宅、原田部隊佔了沙頭　廠、福田部隊佔了縣政府、僞組　會長梁天祿、副蘇××、陳××、僞自警團仍是由那班引×的佛出偽警團員、改爲大良自警團、</p>
<p>實際上的大良、自從淪陷了後、眞的變了一個死　市、商店全都關了門、停止買　、民　是十室九空、僅存的店戶是被逼營業的食物店、和自然出現的煙舘賭館、行人、除了×兵、不良的份子——煙　——　徒——賭徒、正當市民、恐怕不到十分一、</p>
<p>廿七日的凌晨、嘈雜的人聲、鬧成一片、當時我還以爲×兵弄出了什麽亂子、後來經過一度的調査、才曉到×兵出發進攻容奇和桂洲、聽到了這个×情、我曾幾度設法逃返容奇、向我們的團隊作一個詳細的諜報、但是迷濛的濃霧、阻碍一切的途徑、而且×人這囘進攻容桂是分了白蓮市、大拗、門頭、　崗、南沙等五路進發、所以任何的一條路綫、也沒有通過、我的任務也沒有法完成、這是一件最遺憾的事情、</p>
<p>十一時、我在大良已聽到我們的團隊退守容桂消息、但是仍然和×人混戰、等待援軍抵達時、馬上就向×人反攻、這時我想我的任務已吿一段落、在無論若何的艱苦、也許要短期間　開這個淪陷區、繼續我底抗戰宣傳的工作、於是轉道了馬江的背後、沿着桑基魚塘、由南沙轉東西馬寧、經過了整日整夜不停的步行、才抵達我軍防地小欖、</p>
<p>因爲這次記者除實地踏査大良的新聞任務之外、還附帶着爲一區別働隊司令幹部　査工作、所以、在新聞報道上較少、諜報較多、爲的是直接帮助抗戰、現在記者决意拋了筆桿拿槍杆去、和×人幹一下子、起來吧、不願做奴隸的人們、</p>

<h3>世界給最大女星　格麓西費茲</h3>
<p>誰是好萊場薪給最大的女演員？是瑙瑪希拉？是嘉寶？或竟是狄娜實萍或秀蘭鄧波兒呢？……一點也不是、這是個在英國爲人熟知、在美國尙屬一個新名字的人——　麗西費爾茲（GraciaFleds）</p>
<p>『那時候、我們是一貧如洗、家徒四壁、窮得和敎堂裏的老鼠一　——也許還有過之而無不及——、所以在六歲的時候、就有了一个出外弄一兩个小錢補助家用的心思、我决定了在街頭用那六歲的女聲最高音唱歌、心想總有路人會受了我的感動而擲下幾个便士在我的帽子裏、可是事實不盡然、我似乎對於自己的音樂才能過於信任一點了、聽到我歌聲的人、只輕蔑的對我看看、掩旗息鼓、我囘了家」、</p>
<p>這是格麗西費爾茲的話、她現在是世界上薪給最大的女演員了、十七年來、在大不列顚帝國高踞着明星最高的寳座、同時在比利時、荷蘭、法蘭西、挪威、和瑞典也擁有很大數目的觀衆、</p>
<p>她、這個磨坊小鎭出身的貧苦女郞、也曾榮受英王與后的命令、在無綫電中或是在舞台上作過很多次御前的表演、</p>
<p>因爲她是貧寒出身的、所以現在她雖然已經成了名有了錢、然而她還是坦白誠實、决不以她過去的貧苦生活爲可恥、她是個具有良好性格的伶人、</p>
<p>「我的母親當時地在當——蘭開夏——的戲院裏替人洗衣』她在和二十世紀福斯公司簽訂了合同後的一次午膳時坦白的承認——這個合同註明她可以在英美兩地輪流拍片——「我呢、常常當她把洗好的衣服送去時跟着一同去、漸漸的在後台學會了一點曲子、回到家來練習、引吭高歌、全家爲之鷄犬不寧、八歲的時候、居然成績不錯、在一家電影院裏做一個小歌女、一個月之後、我又辭退了這個職務而加入兒童班表演、報酬嗎、其慘無比——每星期一先令」</p>
<p>「十五歲的時候我去加入歌舞女班、不幸那管理人只對我看了一眼、便認我爲不合格、我的心碎了、以爲我已經失掉了在舞台上表演的最大機會、這時候家庭經濟情形居然略見好轉、父親寫信來、說他不願我上舞台、希望我能囘到斯坦斯維爾入紗廠去工作、他又說、這並不能稱是什麼職業、然而至少比我毫無成就一力想做伶人以致餓死的好、我十二分高興的贊成了、因爲那時候我已經三頓沒有吃飯了、」</p>
<p>『到了那兒、果然如父親所說的一樣、這件工作算不上是一个職業、工作時間久而報酬小、我還沒有死了表演歌唱的心、常常在工作的時間內縱聲高唱、我一唱、別的工人都放下了手裏的工作來靜聽、她們這樣的來　我歌唱、我个人當然很高興、然而工廠方面却大受我的累、工作延誤了、所以不多久、廠方停止了我的薪給、換句話說、我又被開除了」、</p>
<p>說到這裏、華雷斯皮萊帶了他的小女兒過來和她一同拍照、打斷了話頭、華雷斯對她說了許多傾慕的話、稱她爲世界第一的喜劇家、華雷斯走後、又有二十世紀福斯女星佛琴尼費爾茲來、和她招呼、很親熱的談了一會、</p>
<p>「我第一次眞正的舞台職業」他說、當佛琴尼走了以後、「是一九一四年在一個啞劇、狄克患丁登」中飾摩洛胥公主、其後又在「倫敦的鮑華先生」中得到一個很好的角色、這個劇本好極了、後來被介紹到倫敦成爲一部人所盡知的名劇」、</p>
<p>格麗西很謙恭、並不把這成功歸之於自身、可是我們很看得出來、這次她不但在倫敦成功、在各地也成功、而作此以後、她就成了大不列顚帝國最着名的一個女演員、直至今日、</p>
<p>事業成功、她就和亞基　茲結了婚、他是一個遵演　製作人、至他的訓練指導之下、她更進一步的達到她事業的尖端、</p>
<p>「有時候」、她說、「我一天連演六塲、三場在一家、另外三場在別一家、忙是忙一點、可是興趣却很充足、而且因爲有好多人都願意來見我一面、我總儘可能的在後台招待他們」、</p>
<p>現在、她也還是如此、</p>
<p>格　西爾滋這個名宇常和差利卓別麟相提並論、這是很有理由的、正如卓別麟一樣、她在使人哈哈大笑之中感到點辛酸落淚之感、她的戲一半是啞劇、一半是有聲的、而她的藝術造就、也是遍廣於全世界、無論世界上那處的人都能明白而且欣賞她的作品、在比利時、在法國、在德國、她並不改變她的動作或英國語、然而每個人都能了解」、</p>
<p>「第一次到美國來是十年前、在紐約一家戲院表演、有人勸吿我應該改變我以前唱歌的調子來迎合美國觀衆、頭上三天我信了他的話、第四天上我又囘復我以前的歌聲了、然而聽衆們甚表歡迎、好的滑稽、只要不滑頭或諷刺過甚、無論在說那一種言話的國家內都有觀衆的』、</p>
<p>不常播音、政府方面限制她播音的次數、其中原因、因爲幾年　她作過一次播音後、舞台老板和經理都大起恐慌、紛紛抱怨、只要她一播音、每个人都留在家　開無綫電機收聽了、據估計、聽她搭音的人數目當在四十萬的樣子、這樣戲院的營業太受影響了、所以後來她播音受了限制、每年只許二次、</p>
<p>在一九三一年她進入影界、一鳴驚人的成爲英國最受歡迎薪金最大的女星</p>
<p>究竟、她的上新金有多大呢、這是很難估計的、我們祗知道她留聲機片所得的純利約在五百萬鎊左右、她每星期要收到五百五十封信、一都是請求她主催慈善賣物會、或是去作美女比賽的評判人、以及別種事情的、在最近一次競選中、有二百個政治家請她作後盾、可是她都拒絕了，她甚至有一艘汽船，用她的名字作船名，她的「影迷會」包括有好幾百人，都是忠心擁護她的人、</p>
<p>她很願意長久留在加州、然而不行，她假如眞的留在美國，那就像秀蘭鄧波兒離開美國住在英國的情形一樣，英國人將痛心的失去他們，最受歡迎的一代大藝人了。</p>

<h3>今日甲組足球聯賽　東方會出戰米軍　下午五時在掃捍埔場舉行　滬名將許文奎曹秋亭參戰</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）東方會甲組足球隊自轉入第二循環賽後、卽走順境、續分突增、截至現在止、以穩有第三名次之關係、對亞軍一席、尙希望未絕、因而今日與米杜息之戰、成一重要關鍵、若其於此最後一舉而克米軍、則得廿九分、便可坐視他日南華南對海軍一役之成敗如何、從中而取利、雖則此乃因人成事之轉機、猶未敢卜其能否如願、然以希望所在、聲譽所關、今旣有機可乘、則應盡人事而圖之，蓋亞軍亦是光榮物、得來固不易也、</p>
<p>東方因將有南遊之舉，邀得上海名將許文奎、曹秋亭來港從征、今日値此機緣、得演奸身手於掃桿埔場中、是誠東方之福、而球迷眼福亦不淺也、茲將許曹二將之履歷、略爲介紹、許氐乃當今全能體育健將、爲一特出奇才、網球、籃球均有水準以上之技能、對于足球、更有心得、自東華以來、歷任平漢、北寧、四川、等名隊之中鋒或右內鋒職、以善盤巧射著名、去年底出川過　、東方擬邀其効力、彼亦躍躍欲試、旋因上海麗都隊促駕北返、在港登場之說未果、今日重來、卒成事實、此乃球緣凑合也、</p>
<p>曹氏是國內有數左翼名將、盤傳射擊、淸爽美麗、在北寧時、與姜璐合拍、有前線雙絕之譽、其時姜任左翼、彼任　內鋒，今日爲東方効勞、或仍充是職、當然駕輕就熱、如侯澄滔缺席、則以彼任左翼、彼綽號「小三子」、曾因踢球而斷腿兩次、最近上海麗都隊榮獲史高托盃及初級冠軍、得力於曹者良多也、</p>
<p>今日東方多此二員猛將上陣、如虎添翼、取勝甚有把握、何况此役乃屬單面關係、在東方視之爲重要、在米軍視之爲等閒、蓋米軍地位落後、勢無所爭、又自屈臣、哥羅根返英後、實力大不如前、雖後補有人、軍容尙盛、但因得失無關輕重、循例登塲、敢料士無鬥志、故東方之勝、實可能也、</p>
<p>東方各員之技術狀况、日臻佳境、此乃衆目共覩者、今日復調許竟成爲中堅、以充實前銜綫之作戰力、編排有序，實得我心、若屆時劉始讚能制阻梳氏之進展、竟成截擊皮亞臣之衝剌、羅偉權又能看牢葛尼不使活動則米軍前綫最足爲患之人物、當無發揮餘地矣、惟米軍之前衞線、至爲强堅、許曹兩新將、應事先熱籌避實乘虛之策、方易奏效、而合作工夫、尤不可不注重也、</p>
<p>日來放晴、場地乾爽、東方前線所擅長之突擊法、大好及時利用、而且諸鋒皆以矯掩稱於時、其進展迅速必無疑義、所慮者許曹初次參戰、或未得默契之合作耳、兩隊排陣如下、</p>

<p>南華體育會以是次星洲一中華足球隊遠征來港、健將如雲、三場比賽、無異共冶我國足球精銳於一爐、將來世運代表我國人選、亦可於此戰得其大概、故爲鄭重其事、力求屆時秩序整齊、全神專注、便賽會進行得臻美滿起見、特定四月一二五日星華隊比賽三天期內、所有加山該會籃排網球場及場館地方、暫停供給會員應用、並經通函各部主任、査照辦理、又聞日來在華人行南華桌球場及强華公司預售之港星球賽入場券、前往定購者、絡繹不絕、擠擁異常、一元門票，旦將吿罄、球迷欲得佳坐務宜及早定購、以免向隅云、</p>
<p>間竹、大觀之至，惟此時芬査已疲態畢露、應付已感困難、林乃乘其破綻、一氣呵成，以竟全功、此盤爲十比六局、</p>
<h3>昨日綱球賽　林添德技果不凡　苦戰芬查以二比零得勝　今日又單打共三場舉行</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）公開草地網球雙單打賽、自開始以來、經有一月、在淘弱留强過程中、已入緊張階段、惟競爭之烈、無逾昨日林添德對芬査之單打賽、雙方相持至三十二局、然後解决勝負、則情况之緊張、比數之接近、槪可想見矣、</p>
<p>林乃廣東梅縣人、生長於霹震、現年二十、當十餘歲卽開始作網球之戲、因富有天才、技乃日進，今年未來港入港大攻讀之前、曾榮膺霹靂雙單打冠軍、</p>
<p>芬査則爲本港多年前之單打主盟、令因年事漸長、球藝略不如則、然其經驗　富、仍不失爲本港單打老手</p>
<p>昨日此場比賽、一爲少年將軍、一爲斲輪老手、相遇之下、必有惡鬥、故觀者甚衆、絢稱熱鬧、</p>
<p>以記者所見、林之平手抽球、準而有力、軟硬兼施之發球術、亦具妙手、昨之得勝、有賴於上述兩優點者固多、而其年少力强、更佔便宜不少、惟反手抽球、常失準度、有時則佳，有時則劣、故其陷於苦戰而後勝者、純由反手抽球絕少得利所致若此技亦佳、則取勝較易也、又其作風祗慣用左右底綫撇擊、甚少上網、此或鑑於芬査經驗充足、致不敢嘗試、復見其所走位置、常有錯誤、幸而動作怏捷、得以彌補、總之、林固可造之材、他日必成名器、惟目下經騐尙新耳、</p>
<p>芬査之撇擊、仍有疾力、中場斬球、更爲老到、惟人肥氣弱、奔跑過　、球之來勢貼身、尤爲彼所最忌、故每每因以上兩弱點而致失球，非球藝與經驗不足相爭也、</p>
<p>開賽後、芬査先取兩局林亦還以顏色、如是者相持至五比五及六比六、殺得難解難分、當中兩人常有佳作、博得觀衆掌聲不少、及後林加意努力、常乘對方弱點而攻，及發球得利，遂冉下兩局、以八比六勝、第一盤、比數如下、</p>
<p>第一盤</p>
<p>林添德　一三四四五六四五</p>
<p>芬査　四五一二七四一三</p>
<p>一一二六四四　八局</p>
<p>四四四四一二　　局</p>
<p>林乘先勝之威、在第二盤開始後、卽連捷兩局、取勝殊易，然芬査究有經騐、雖乏氣力、仍能捉着機會而反攻、故戰成四比四局時、情形最爲緊張、扣人心弦、試觀當時十比八與八比十之點數、其膠着狀態、可以槪見、進而五比五、六比六、八比八、三度平局，若梅花</p>
<p>第二盤</p>
<p>林添德　四四一四八十三二</p>
<p>芬査　一一四一十八五四</p>

<h3>關于香港的學校體育　（二）</h3>
<p>— —卓越—</p>
<p>體育的地位與體育的指導員、應該看重普遍化的體育，整個學校的員生、人人也能够有强健的體魄、健全的精神這就是學校的無限大而寶　的錦標、我必不敢說、香港的學校、對于體育沒有比較上軌道的、而重視體育的、不過、有的是佔少數、而不能達于多數、更不能普遍的吧、</p>
<p>（二）各學校對于</p>
<p>體育指導</p>
<p>因爲香港多數的學校輕視體育的緣故、所以、已往學校的體育指導員、都居半數屬于運動員、或在普通學校錐業、而梢有運動興趣的人、我必不敢說、這種的人村、其中沒有特出的—自己能够苦心去研究、得到很好結果的、不過、總不及其他大學的體育系、或專科學校畢業出身的人、因爲體育系或專科的總比較充實一點、無論學問或技術也會有高深的研究、過去香港的學校體育之所以不能普遍發展的綠故、對于這種不正當門戶出身體育指導員亦無不有很大的關係、希望今後的學校執事、如能眞爲敎育而設學校、爲國民之健全而敎育者、應注意到體育的訓練、及體育指導之聘任、應尊重他的學歷經驗、品格的修養與精神、</p>
<p>（三）體育場</p>
<p>香港各學校、因爲地勢與環境的關係、所以對于體育場的建築都成了很大的問題，甚至很多學校、速體育場所沒有的、故此引起了很多學校以此爲籍詞、于是輕視了體育科、或放棄了體育科、事實我們切不能因場所的問題、而致忽視了學生體格的訓練、養成了一般文弱的書生、和弱不勝衣的姑娘、應該要克苦的去打破一切不良的環境和困難艱苦的事情利用我們機巧活潑的頭腦去應付一切、只求其能够達到我們體育訓練的目的、都應該硬着胆子去苦幹、在這困苦的環境、當然不容許我們建築田徑場、或標準的足、籃、排球場、但總可以因環境而設施、提倡各種不需要寬闊場所的運動、如活潑噐械操等、甚至這種的場地沒也有時、我們更可以利用天台、或騎樓也無不可、再退一步的說、在敎室裏遊戲體操、或把攝椅暫時的搬在一角之後、實行墊上運動等也可以、祗看我們是否能願意把國民體格訓練的重担子，負在身上吧、若能够有這種决心、當然、什麼困難、也可以打破、場所必不是我們的問題、</p>
<p>（四）應提倡活潑器機操</p>
<p>在過去的學校體育、其所以不發展的原因、大部份固屬于場所的問題、但其他方面的、都要歸咎于以前的體育指導、不能因環境而設施、祗見得到的、是球戲或田徑賽的體育、未能注意到香港學校的環境上最宜于提倡的運動，這種體育的訓練、它的價値、不獨包括有球戲及田徑　等的效能、或更要高超的、就是活潑的器械操、關於這種的設備、故不需廣闊的場所而對于經費方面、亦極至廉儉、也耐用，故對于香港學校體育之能否普及、這就是一很好的路徑、若各學校都能够向這條大道進發、當然、對于「普及體育」這個口號、是很容易實行與達到目的、同志們、一齊去提倡吧、　（未完）</p>

<h3>馬德里圍城出奔的喜劇（續）</h3>
<p>— Guzinan　莊重譯</p>
<p>—我們不能放棄了這里的陣綫，通通跑到那兒去，二千人够了，其餘的可以留在這里……沒有人肯留在那里。費了很大的口舌才把他們說服的。結果二千—頸里圍着紅黑的手巾，高喊着革命的口號，胸中充滿着戰鬥情緒的靑年，毫不遲延地向着死和光榮的馬德里的防衞戰出發……</p>
<p>在達蘭買有　數百在西古英沙會戰死存的鬥士，此外還有人數約略柑同的馬德里工人和農民也加進他們的隊伍。十一月六日他們收到了一道命令說：</p>
<p>—不要讓誰帶着武噐通過—馬德里需要一切的軍了！</p>
<p>從馬德里開出了一大隊汽車，車里載着一班怕死逃難的傢伙。在　蘭貢地方，那些手里握着槍的民軍們便阻止了那些大汽車的前進：</p>
<p>—你們到甚麼地方去？</p>
<p>—抹陵西亞</p>
<p>—爲甚麽</p>
<p>—特別的任務</p>
<p>確是特別的任務的時候，所有精神不健全的人們都在找尋一個特別的任務。可是那班民軍們拌不這樣就算數。</p>
<p>—你們都是一些卑怯的東西—囘轉馬德里去！</p>
<p>有些感到羞愧轉回去了。有的則試着在通過去：</p>
<p>—好，那麽就放下你們的武器吧，在抹陵西亞。</p>
<p>用不到這些，那是毫無作用的</p>
<p>一輛汽車載來了柏度洛。里哥（馬德里市長—譯者）他們對着車頭開了一槍，使里哥的面孔完全變成死色，他驚悸地不知要怎麽樣好，看到他那種狼狽的情形，那班民軍們大笑了起來：</p>
<p>一個民軍對着他叱道。　—也想逃跑嗎？卑怯的東西。</p>
<p>柏度洛，里哥在還强爲自己辯解，於是更有一個打斷他的括頭說</p>
<p>—一定要我們把你的面孔去碰壁嗎！</p>
<p>他慌張的馬上逃跑，在訕笑和　嘲的追逐下向着馬德里轉回去。他一到馬德里之後即找尋一個外國的使館來做避難所……一已經是黃昏的時候了，指揮隊伍檢査的是荷瑟。維耶路也抹，他係一個疲削豪胆有决斷的人物，在奪取孟達雅兵營的當兒以及在瓜打一拉哈拉和西古英沙的會戰中，都曾顯出了他的英勇的氣概，當馬德里受威脅的時候他就帶着他的人們前往該城的防衛戰，他在加沙。特。甘波戰場上迭著戰績，隨在特魯也爾地方和外國的匪徒苦戰而死。</p>
<p>來了一隊汽車，民軍們把它們扣住了。一個聲音高叫道：</p>
<p>—放開—車里有好多部長！</p>
<p>所有各車里的坐客，都被叫下身來，其中有一位便對維耶路也抹道：</p>
<p>—這眞是一種亂暴！我是某某部的，我是到抹陵西亞去的……。</p>
<p>繼耶路也抹答道：—像你們部長的責任，照理當這時局危急之際，應該留在民衆的旁邊不走才對的。現在你們跳跑，你們會使戰鬥員的士氣沮喪了哩……</p>
<p>再出現了三個四個，他們一樣都是部長們。維耶路也抹解除了他們的武裝幷把他們弄進一個屋子去。一個部長不禁慌忙忙着問：</p>
<p>—要做甚麽？</p>
<p>—我高興這樣—　耶路也抹答—明天當我們上火綫的時候，把你們帶到陣前去……</p>
<p>—這是一種野蠻舉動……</p>
<p>—大部分是把你們拿來槍斃，像你們所應得的…</p>
<p>隨卽他打電話給抹爾（抹爾係C．N．T．的首腦也就是的馬德里實際負責的防衞者）說：</p>
<p>—這里我有着四個從馬德里逃出來的部長，你想我要怎麽樣辦？</p>
<p>抹爾的頭腦幷不曾紛亂，他知道在這時局萬分嚴重，大家的生命都是千鈞一髪之際，政府的搬走只能解釋爲逃避職責，他是反對搬遷的。可是扣留那些部長又有甚麽用處，因此他命令這：</p>
<p>—讓他們自由！</p>
<p>—但這是……</p>
<p>—沒有甚麽，沒有甚麽！你照我對你說的話做吧！</p>
<p>—好，可是我要免去我的責任，你寫一張命令給我吧……　抹爾給了他所要的命令，當收到時他慢慢的讀起來，隨他卽對那些部長們說：—組織指（C．N．T．）反對我們的意見，我現在放你們自由，你們可以前往抹陵西亞去了。可是別要忘記你們今天的逃跑情形，也不要忘記在戰鬥中的馬德里民衆的英勇……</p>
<p>那班部長們憤恨地趕快爬上車，開足馬力向前跑去。已經黎明的時光了。維耶路也抹在車路中眼看他們已經去遠。隨後他便高聲喊道</p>
<p>—現在，我們要來完成我們救訪馬德里的責任了</p>
<p>人們開始爬上那些大汽軍，向着和部長們相背的方向出發。他們是朝向死的方面走的，可是同樣也是朝着自由的勝利的生的方面走去……　（完）</p>
<h3>自已文章</h3>
<p>— 陳現文</p>
<p>想要來談文學與其感受性，不期然地又想起了「自己文章」這句話，「自己文章」因爲它時常和「別人妻子」這句話配合在一起，所以，它的嚴肅性失掉了，而其所包含一部分眞理，也因之給人家忽略了；實則，我們固然不能肯定它絕對性的眞理，而具有相對性的眞理却是不容否認的。</p>
<p>作者歷來是利用作品去刻劃理性，感染情緒，反映親實的，自古典派到寫實派，一連串地在證明這種解釋的正確；而文學的進展和歷史的進展同樣在增加着複雜性，所以，近代文學不單盡量容納旣成的解釋，而對現實則常用批判的眼光，卽是作者憑他對於現實充裕的經驗而生的感覺（主觀的和客觀的），以一種最適當的手法表現出來。、</p>
<p>越是一篇佳絕無瑕的作品，越能在纖小的段句或平淡的場合中去完成它的使命；作爲是一個讀者或批評家，他應當怎樣去理解和探求作品中作者對於自然歷史和人類底思維的眞實性的認識和表現呢？如果他們缺乏與作者同樣對於現實事象的體驗和理解，卽是說他們缺乏對於同樣現實事象的體驗和理解，或是以一種不經心的態度去鑑定那篇作品的價値，結果會怎樣，無疑的，他們會陷入絕大的錯誤。</p>
<p>所以，一個作者對於現實的體騐和理解的正確以至表現方法之周密固然重要，而同樣重要的是一個讀者或批評家去鑑定一篇作品的憫値時應具有對於這作品所表現的現實事象的經騐和理解。</p>
<p>因之，「自己文章」這句話，不能成立絕對性的眞理是因爲作者未必正確地用批判的眼光去表現現實事象，而其具有相對性的眞理的是因爲作者對於所表現的現象有時會比其他的人更能切實地理解。</p>
<h3>替科學家呼冤</h3>
<p>— 水厂</p>
<p>自從世界大戰以後，我們常聽到社會上一般批評：說是科學家造孽，發明了種種殺人利器，供野心家的利用，弄成一將功成萬骨枯的局勢。到得近年來，眼看東亞西默，許多人民遭受了絕大的犧牲，供飛機大炮炸彈機關槍的殘殺。這種責備科學家的聲浪。更是一天高似一天。但是這都是一時的感情作用，才將理智弄糊塗了。許多人以爲科學家對於發明一種新的東西，應當負一種責任；凡是遇到對於殺人有可能性的智識和方法，須要事前預防；或是在發明以前就不進行工作；或是在發明以後當嚴守秘密，絕對不供人利用。照這樣說，我們上古的聖人燧人氏發明了鑽木取火，就犯了許多罪惡，也應該早見到後來的人會借火殺人，還有後世戰術裏會有火攻的方法就不鑽什麽木了。</p>
<p>黃帝造車，最初用牛引，後來用馬拉。到得兩國相爭，兵車占很重要的地位。古人又說：戎之大用在於馬，故漢高祖有馬上得天下的豪語，可見車和馬都是二十世紀以前戰爭所必需的東西。當初車就不應當發明，馬就不應當訓養了。古時鑄金爲刃，刃是指刀劍矛戟矢，可說是殺人的兇器，金是金屬，最初　銅，後來用鐵，最後用鋼。這些金屬也都不應當發明了的。</p>
<p>在石器時代人類用石頭當兇器。等得大家會用了，於是爲抵抗爭存起見，就　明了弓矢的用處。後來覺得還不够利害，就發明了火器，像火箭火銃之類。冉進一步，就是近代的槍砲。誰能說禦外侮的時候，不應當　盡心血，想種種自衛的方法呢？假使有人說：我們有了傘，所以使天下雨，那一定要指他有神經病了。然則實備科學家批評物質文明的人，不是犯了同樣的毛病嗎？</p>
<p>批評科學的人還要強辯，一定指近代的飛機大砲，確是科學的結晶品。試問造成飛機爲運輪上交通上便的利，和黃帝造車，有什麽分別呢？發明炸藥爲開　山鑛制服猛獸，和燧人氏取火，有什麽分別呢？科學上的發明，還是有益於人類的地方多呢？有　於人類的地方多呢？卽便科學家代人受過，屈打成招了種種莫須有殺人放火的罪名。恐怕將功折罪起來，已經是功多罪少哩。</p>
<p>兵器决不能强分做兩種，一種自衛的和一種攻人的，單講自衛，不講攻人，是消極的抵抗，但是絕對消極的抵抗，是沒有這回事，要做抵抗侵略的工作，必須尋求相當有效的還擊的方法和力量，方才能有把握呀。一總之，科學寂决不能預料一種發明，有沒有不正當的應用，亦决不能防止一種發明。給不講道　的人利用着爲非作惡。並且明知一種發明，於人類不見得有什麽好處，爲了環境的特殊關係　，也不能不努力進行，批評的人總須放棄主觀的態度，才能公允哩。</p>
<h3>東江你奔流吧！</h3>

<p>— 舒群</p>
<p>雖然她是一個弱者；但是，弱者被脆弱感情完全操從的時候，也有一刹那，是最勇敢的行動。不過，在這行動中，缺乏强者理智的約束，支配這行動的，祗有一種盲動性—甚至長神經的錯亂。這正像弱者勇於自殺的行動和心理一樣。被這行動佔有的一刹那心理，雖是變態的；但變　的智慧，在這行動佔有的一刹那，比常時也許更加聰明。這正像顯者對於自殺所發見的巧妙的方法一樣。她停住等候他一下，讓他和自己平行以後；她故意　柔地問他：</p>
<p>『你太冷了吧？』</p>
<p>『你不恨我了囑？』</p>
<p>『當名，我不呢你了！你太冷了嗎？我還是把圍巾給你吧！』</p>
<p>『不！』他拍拍自己的胸脯給她看，又說：「我不怕冷！」她不允許。他祇好伸出手來：</p>
<p>『那給我吧！』</p>
<p>『不，我給你圍！』</p>
<p>『謝謝你！』</p>
<p>他怕轟負她的好意，便停下了，從衣領　探出頭來，等待讓她圍起圍巾。但是，感覺有一股風，又似乎是一條冰流，進入皮肉；然後，才知道被圍巾下藏着的尖刀，突然刺中了自己的頸項，裂開一處口縫，血一滴一滴地流落下來。當時，他幸而後退一步，並且捉住她的手，不然，他或受了重傷。他不曾想她會有這般勇敢的試騐，更想不到刹那前的猛虎，而後竟變成小羊—她曾是在昏迷中倒了的，倒在他的脚下，那復仇而又染了仇恨的血的尖刀被她丟在自己的身旁。他被驚和被傷以後，不免有些憤怒。不過，他把她那一刹那前後兩種極端不同的姿態，對比一下，她好像兩個靈魂的所有者，使他覺得好笑，奇異；所以他忍受着自己的傷痛，而她把從地上扶起來。他一邊給她打播着身上的　跡，一邊含笑地喚着她；</p>
<p>『醒醒吧，天快亮啦！』是的，她的確像睡過一小覺；醒來以後，仍有着沉沉的　意。</p>
<p>『你勝利了』。她聽到他的括聲，便哭了，這哭聲，對他是一種慚愧？因爲他並沒有報復；對自己是一種責難，因爲對自己並沒有得到滿足。　（廿三）</p>

<h3>A Warm Welcome to Overseas Chinese Returning to Serve the Nation</h3>
<p>The War of Resistance has entered a more urgent and critical stage!</p>
<p>This is a turning point that will determine the survival or demise, enslavement or freedom, of the entire Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The turning point of the War of Resistance also marks the transition from a phase of "Japanese strength and our weakness" and "Japanese victory and our defeat" to a phase of "mutual stalemate between Japan and us" and "evenly matched strength." In this new stage, the main force of the Japanese has not yet suffered a fatal blow, and our strength has not yet progressed to the necessary degree to "overcome the Japanese and achieve victory." Therefore, the Japanese are still able to highly leverage their combat power and continue to display their ferocity in attacking cities, seizing land, and forcefully occupying roads. However, each time the Japanese combat power is leveraged to its highest degree (such as the recent costly capture of Nanchang), the rate at which their combat power declines will inevitably become more rapid and drastic. Coupled with the increasingly serious political, economic, and diplomatic difficulties faced by the Japanese, this will ultimately lead them toward a path of total collapse. However, if we do not add to this our own progress in military, political, economic, and diplomatic affairs, especially in the general mobilization of the people, and do not inflict even greater blows on the Japanese in the current stage, then when the Japanese highly leverage their combat power, engage in military adventures, and coordinate them with political conspiracies of division, fragmentation, compromise, and mediation, our War of Resistance will suffer a major impact, the success of our national liberation cause will be even more distant, and the hardships and dangers in its course will be beyond our imagination!</p>
<p>Based on these characteristics of the current War of Resistance, we must intensify our progress in political, economic, and diplomatic affairs, especially in the general mobilization of the people, and inflict heavy blows on the Japanese in many ways. It is particularly important to concentrate the spiritual and material strength of the entire nation as soon as possible to persist in unity, persist in the War of Resistance, and strive for victory. The efforts of overseas Chinese are especially important in this regard. Since the full-scale outbreak of the War of Resistance in the motherland, overseas Chinese everywhere have enthusiastically supported it, contributing money and effort. Although this cannot be compared with the arduous struggles and generous sacrifices of the soldiers on the front lines and the compatriots in the war zones, their spirit of sacrificing for the nation's crisis and dedicating themselves to the motherland occupies one of the most glorious pages in the history of China's War of Resistance.</p>
<p>According to news published in newspapers in Hong Kong and Japan, specialized technical personnel among overseas Chinese in various places have recently been joining forces to return to the country to serve. For example, the "East River Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps," organized by the Huizhou Fellow Countrymen Association in various parts of Southeast Asia, consisting of two groups, set off for home today, the 24th. The third batch of the "Drivers Returning Home Service Corps," organized by the Johor Bahru Fundraising Association, also completed its training period and set off for home today, the 24th. In addition, forty-two members of the "Taiping Mechanics Returning Home Service Corps" from Johor also departed from Penang on the same day to transfer to ships for Hong Kong and then return home. Furthermore, overseas Chinese from Malacca, Bentong, Senhua, Singapore, and other places have abandoned their professions and organized returning home service corps to serve the motherland's War of Resistance. They are all making preparations one after another and will soon set off for home to serve. There are countless others that have not been reported or are currently being prepared!</p>
<p>This righteous and patriotic action of overseas Chinese in various places demonstrates, on the one hand, that our government's national policy of upholding unity in resisting Japan and building the nation is fully in line with the common demands of all Chinese people for independence and freedom, and is a merciless blow to all traitors and rebels who attempt to incite disorder by advocating anti-communism and peace. On the other hand, it can also demonstrate to people all over the world the supreme and great spirit of the Chinese nation, enhancing the confidence of international justice and peace-loving people in our country's inevitable victory in the War of Resistance and inevitable success in nation-building.</p>
<p>Our government has promulgated many laws and regulations regarding welcoming overseas Chinese to return to serve the nation. We hope that the government can further enhance its concrete rewards in the future and help overseas Chinese solve many personal issues, such as the freedom to participate in the anti-Japanese and national salvation work, and the guarantee of their livelihoods and family finances. At the same time, we also have hopes for our compatriots:</p>
<p>First, we hope that overseas Chinese in various places will hold enthusiastic farewell or honorary meetings for groups or individuals returning home to serve, and express respect to the families of overseas Chinese returning home to serve through organizations and public opinion, hold regular condolences, and assist them in solving various problems.</p>
<p>Second, we hope that compatriots in the country and in areas close to the motherland will hold grand welcome meetings, farewell meetings, and honorary meetings, and other mass gatherings when overseas Chinese returning home to serve pass through. Moreover, we should use the power of various people's organizations and the broad masses to help overseas Chinese returning home to serve quickly and effectively solve the problems that may arise along the way. We want to make every overseas Chinese who is determined to return home to serve feel as intimate, happy, and excited as if they have returned to the embrace of a long-separated mother when they set foot in the motherland!</p>
<p>Third, and this is particularly important, we hope that wealthy overseas Chinese, as well as overseas Chinese who are unable to return home to serve immediately, should intensify and expand fundraising campaigns, debt repayment campaigns, charity sales, and all economic activities that meet the current urgent needs of the motherland and contribute to the cause of Chinese national liberation. As for investing in the motherland, developing the rich resources of the southwest and northwest, and developing the economic construction of the rear areas, these are major tasks for laying the foundation for building a new China in the future, and they require the efforts of overseas Chinese from all walks of life with vision, especially the press and educators, to intensify their efforts to promote their widespread and effective realization.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese have long created a glorious page in the cause of world justice and peace. They have created great and immortal honor for the revolutionary and nation-building cause of the motherland. Now, at this critical stage that will determine the life and death of the Chinese nation and the severity of the War of Resistance, the efforts of our overseas Chinese are becoming even more important! Let us redouble our efforts! The bright and happy future of the motherland is waiting for us to create!</p>
<h3>The Establishment of the Anti-Japanese Base Area in the Ji'nan Plain</h3>
<p>[North China Dispatch] Starting from He Shun, crossing the treacherous and towering Taihang Mountains, and winding out of the rugged Yangyang, one descends to the flat and boundless Hebei Plain. The Pinghan Railway, running north and south, lies there horizontally. This transportation line, which has already been occupied by the Japanese, can no longer lie there peacefully as before. Our Jixi guerrillas, lurking near the railway, and a portion of a certain Route Army frequently appear and destroy it mercilessly, leaving it in pieces and unable to connect from end to end, causing it to be restless and losing its normal function. Our guerrillas often set out several times a day, each time destroying the railway mercilessly and then returning safely with a victorious smile. Our troops and staff members also shuttle back and forth along the side of the railway every day. As long as the railway is broken two miles away, the Japanese cannot rule. In fact, they are at a loss even for this only transportation line and are instead under the control of our guerrillas.</p>
<p>The vast plain area of Ji'nan and Jizhong includes the area north to the Cangshi Road, south to the border of Hebei and Henan, east to the border of Shandong, and west to the Pinghan Railway, with more than twenty counties of varying sizes. However, since our army withdrew last year, it has become an area without anyone in charge, with the masses still vaguely living their "tranquil" lives. There is no government, army, or popular organization. At the same time, the Japanese have not bothered to occupy it, but they have never forgotten this vast area. They have bought off a large number of traitors and bandits to infiltrate various places and carry out activities, organizing all kinds of associations and groups to deceive our backward masses. Especially in the area near the Shandong border, the power of these sects is still quite large even now, and counties such as Nangong, Northeast Zaoqiang, Wuyi, and Daying have simply become their base camps and the base for traitorous activities. Because these places are close to the Jinpu Railway, they all have the original armed forces of the people, using the relationship of feudal superstition. After our government and army withdrew, in order to protect their families, they automatically united and called on backward masses to participate with slogans such as "Invulnerability to knives and spears." At the same time, traitors and bandits took the opportunity to be active, deceiving and anesthetizing the masses with reactionary slogans such as "Protect the hometown without resisting Japan," "Oppose the Communists but not the Japanese," and "Neither resist Japan nor oppose Chiang." Although since March of this year, a certain Route Army Guojin Column has swept across the area and various tasks have also been launched, we began to establish anti-Japanese governments, mobilize and organize the masses, and organize local armed forces in that plain area, and launched a large-scale guerrilla war in the plains, but the power of the sects did not weaken as a result, but instead became larger with the development of our work. The reasons for this are: (1) The mass work is not deep and universal enough; (2) The "fair burden" method promulgated by the J'nan Administrative Office at that time caused misunderstandings among the rich in the implementation process, creating opposition between the rich and the poor, and some wealthy households combined with or joined sects to oppose this method; (3) Because Ji'nan is a cotton producing area, the people's annual income is largely from the large-scale purchase of cotton by the Japanese at high prices. In order to resist this, the Ji'nan Administrative Office ordered a ban on the export of cotton. At that time, it was the time when cotton was on the market, and Ji'nan defended the large-scale export of cotton, which caused a major public resentment. The sects manipulated by the traitors and bandits took the opportunity to deceive the masses with "anti-Japanese and anti-communist" slogans, and many of the masses were deceived and used.</p>
<p>This finally broke out in the "Zaoqiang Incident" in early November. Because the "Baiji Association" in Zaoqiang at that time had considerable power and its members were particularly complex, it openly incited the masses based on the above reasons and colluded with the "Puppet Army" to oppose the government and a certain Route Army, attempting to overthrow the government and eliminate a certain Route Army. A unit of a certain Route Army stationed in Tanxian had long thought of dealing with it. At the same time, the Hebei Provincial Government also realized that the traitorous forces in Zaoqiang were too large and sent a team to prepare to resolve the "Baiji Association." The "Baiji Association" took preemptive action, first gathering more than a thousand members to surround the city and launch an attack, and prohibiting our troops outside the city from entering the city. In order to win over the deceived masses, our army did not retaliate and carried out propaganda and solicitation work with slogans such as "Chinese should not fight Chinese" and "Do not be exploited by Japanese imperialism and traitors." It is said that hundreds of people automatically dispersed, but a few still attempted to resist stubbornly, resulting in armed conflict and many deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>After the political teams' continuous struggle with traitors and bandits and propaganda work with great patience towards the masses, the power of the sects gradually began to weaken after this armed conflict. Some parts were won over and disintegrated, and some parts were incorporated into the current local armed forces - the Peng guerrillas. In the beginning, these guerrillas who had been incorporated in large numbers defected to the "Puppet Army." Even now, this phenomenon still occurs constantly. They openly opposed the anti-Japanese government and a certain Route Army. In that remote area - such as the Zaoqiang Wudao area, the antagonism between the sects and the army and government has not yet been completely eliminated. This still requires our continuous efforts!</p>
<p>In Nangong, the military and political center of Ji'nan, various salvation works are relatively developed, but the further away you go, the weaker it becomes. Although mass organizations, such as the Workers' Salvation Association, the Farmers' Salvation Association, the Women's Salvation Association, and youth organizations, have been generally organized and have general leading organs in Ji'nan; however, the grassroots foundation is still not enough. Because the development of the organization, due to various reasons, has been carried out from top to bottom, and there has not been in-depth and universal educational work and strict organizational life. For example, on the road from Renxian to Junglu to Nangong, which is more than 180 li, there are many villages and towns without self-defense posts. They are only formalistic, and they let passers-by go without asking any questions. It is said that they are all hired by wealthy people to guard their posts; no wonder they are so negligent in their own sacred mission. At the same time, it can also be seen how insufficient the grassroots mass work is in these places, requiring greater and more in-depth efforts.</p>
<p>The governments in more than ten counties in Ji'nan are unified under the leadership of the "Ji'nan Administrative Office." The administration has undergone considerable reforms, and it has achieved considerable results in the formulation and implementation of various new wartime laws and regulations, such as the implementation of laws and regulations such as mobilizing new soldiers, giving preferential treatment to families, fair burdens, and banning cotton exports. Although these laws and regulations initially suffered opposition from the masses to varying degrees, after in-depth propaganda and education work, the masses are now very willing to implement them.</p>
<p>Before the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, Ji'nan and Jizhong were no longer a peaceful place. In order to cooperate with the war on the battlefield, respond to the new combat missions, and welcome the new situation in North China, a mobilization for an emergency battle was launched in Ji'nan under the close cooperation of the military, government, and people. After this call was issued, the entire Ji'nan seemed to have been given a shot in the arm and was revitalized. Everyone, taking Nangong as the center and base, widely mobilized the people to dismantle cities and break roads, empty houses and clear fields... The Ji'nan Workers' Union, Farmers' Union, Women's Salvation Association, and Youth League were all mobilized. The female comrades of the Women's Salvation Association took on the task of supervising and supervising the dismantling of the city, and they always had to return late at night, and then go out early the next day. A few days before the fall of Wuhan, the Japanese attacked Renxian with more than a thousand troops. After occupying Xingjia (northeast of Renxian), they were surrounded by a certain Route Army and Liang Zhong. After two days of hard fighting and complete resolution, people's high work enthusiasm was further encouraged. The city of Nangong was leveled in just over ten days, and the troops were busy conditioning. The soldiers were excitedly waiting for the arrival of new and more cruel battles.</p>
<p>In mid-November, more than two thousand Japanese troops, filled with more than one hundred cars, swaggered out from Xingtai, attempting a major offensive in Ji'nan. The area around Yucheng, Shandong, in the east, also launched fierce battles. The Japanese attempted to approach Nangong from the east and west. On November 16, the Japanese approached Nangong, more than fifty li away from the city gate. At four o'clock in the afternoon, all the people in Nangong city retreated, and everything that could be moved was also taken away. Nangong City almost became an empty city. The four mass organizations, including the Workers' Salvation Association, the Rescue Association, the Women's Rescue Association, and a certain youth organization, and the unit of a certain Route Army, waited for everyone to leave, and finally withdrew after 11 o'clock in the evening. Although they had fought guerrilla warfare in the Taihang Mountains for more than a year, this plain guerrilla life was their first attempt. In front of them was an endless plain, and the Japanese tanks and armored vehicles flaunted their power. Everyone carried their luggage on their backs and walked for two days and nights without rest. On the third day, they arrived in Weixian and continued to advance to Guangzong, retreating and working along the way.</p>
<p>Nangong City was occupied by the Japanese on the 17th. After the Japanese entered the city, they saw only an empty city, ×××××××××××××. On the 18th, a big fire broke out in the city, but our guerrillas lurking outside the city did not move. On the morning of the 19th, more than forty Japanese cars safely drove to the southwest, but at night our guerrillas and self-defense forces outside the city showed their magical power. First, they completely destroyed the roads around the city. The remaining Japanese in the city were completely resolved, and Nangong, the center of the Ji'nan Plain base area, was returned to our hands.</p>
<p>The Japanese's large-scale siege plan against this plain anti-Japanese base area was finally completely crushed under the close unity, heroic struggle, and the three-in-one military, government, and people in Ji'nan. Before the Japanese attacked, when this place was still relatively peaceful, there were many unnecessary "friction" between the military and the government, but after the Japanese attack, this phenomenon of "those close to us are hurt and those who hate us are happy" has gradually been eliminated. This is something we should thank the Japanese for.</p>
<p>The Ji'nan and Jizhong Plain Anti-Japanese Base Areas were established in this way. The question now is how to consolidate it, develop it, and enable it to play its proper strategic role in adhering to the War of Resistance in North China, adhering to the protracted war, and liberating the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>The Rising Tide of Anti-German Anger in Central Europe</h3>
<p>(Special Translation) After annexing Czechoslovakia, Hitler is now launching fierce new conspiracies. His conspiracy lies in the absolute hijacking of Central and Eastern Europe, the plunder of all countries and parts of territories in Central Europe, and the active planning of attacks on Western European powers and the Soviet Union. But in Northern Europe, Germany is actively preparing to annex Klaipeda, control Lithuania, and completely apply the "Sudetenland experience" here.</p>
<p>Under the instigation of German fascists, friction between the Czech Republic and Hungary has greatly increased. German fascists previously provoked disputes between Poland and Hungary on the issue of the Polish-Hungarian border: they sacrificed the southern lands of Slovakia and Carpathian Ukraine to satisfy Hungary's demands, but now openly claim to support Slovakia and overturn the Vienna decision. At the same time, it is also instigating Slovakia against Poland. Germany is also using every means to worsen the relations between Poland and Romania. In the Balkans, Hitler's henchmen are inciting ethnic hatred, encouraging demands to break the status quo, and causing these countries to attack each other.</p>
<p>Obviously, any single country in Central and Eastern Europe is too weak to resist Hitler's oppression. This realization that Hitler's Germany's oppression can only be resisted with collective strength has affected the people of those countries, even the stubborn and backward elements. In the largest of these countries - Poland - countless appeals have been made, calling for the union of the Central European countries against aggression. Most worthy of writing about: These appeals are called out from those who launched the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in October last year: Of course, Poland should bear part of the responsibility for the predicament Poland is in today. Polish Catholic leader Keer Fangtai once wrote: "Today, very few Poles do not admit that the Munich conspiracy to destroy the Czech fortress has fundamentally changed the international situation and Poland's importance." Even some fascist henchmen, who were Hitler's admirers and flag-wavers of the Munich Agreement yesterday, are now shocked that the cession of the German Shen District to Poland is a major political loss for Poland.</p>
<p>The famous right-wing leader, Skulonski, directly suggested the establishment of a "Central European alliance against Hitler's ambitions," he said:</p>
<p>"Although no Eastern European country neighboring Germany has the power to resist German aggression and defend itself alone; but if they unite together - the Balkan countries, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia - they can say to Germany: we all intend to be friendly with Germany, but we cannot sit idly by while one of us is controlled and ruled by Germany. Therefore, we unite to resist any such attempt; it is very clear that the rise of German power in Central Europe is the end of our true independence."</p>
<p>Professor Skulonski clearly pointed out: Such an alliance will greatly enhance the resistance of the countries threatened by Hitler's conquests. In fact, the total population of the above-mentioned countries is 95 million, and if Bulgaria is included, the total can exceed 100 million, much more than Germany's population. Secondly, these countries have extremely important raw materials, some of which have great military value; these raw materials are constantly being transported to Germany, and Germany cannot fight a war without them. These raw materials are: Romanian oil, Polish, Romanian and Yugoslav grains, meat, timber, etc.</p>
<p>Especially important is that in the war to resist foreign aggression, the military discipline of a neutral small country must be more intense than the military discipline of the German army, which is driven to invade other countries' territories and destroy other countries' independence. But most important here is that such an alliance must be supported by peace-loving people and countries. Needless to say, such an alliance must be supported by the bastion of peace, the Soviet Union. For this reason, Mei Guanlitai expressed infinite welcome to the improvement of Soviet-Polish relations.</p>
<p>The people and politicians of Central and Southeastern Europe have now recognized:</p>
<p>"Any country that truly wants to consolidate its security under the situation created by the Munich Agreement must recognize the Soviet Union as a powerful factor in defending peace and can estimate its assistance." (Soviet News, November 1938)</p>
<p>Needless to say, this alliance is completely different from the so-called "neutral alliance" that former Polish Foreign Minister Beck attempted to organize, which was instructed to harm the independence of small and weak nations and harm the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Of course, the prospects for a Central and Southeastern European alliance are still facing some major difficulties and obstacles. First, these countries still have the reactionary policies of the ruling class and foreign countries, and they often play a major or decisive role in these countries' policies. Secondly, there are still contradictions between the reactionary governments and all strata in these countries, old and new territorial disputes, irredentist movements, etc. The policies of reactionary traitors are indeed a terrible but not insurmountable obstacle. Now, even the reactionary government of Poland has had to improve its relationship with the Soviet Union. It was forced to do so by the struggle of the Polish people and the pressure exerted by those bourgeois; however, the traitors in Polish society still do not believe that cooperation with Hitler and participation in the partition of Czechoslovakia have severely harmed Poland's independence. There are countries in Central and Southeastern Europe in the same situation as Poland. But at the same time, the pressure of the working masses here is growing rapidly, and even in bourgeois circles, a change of opinion on relations with Germany can be seen.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current relations between countries, we can see from the following: Polish plunderers have caused great hatred in the Czech Republic. The first news of the improvement of Soviet-Polish relations immediately changed Czech public opinion. There is no doubt that destroying Germany's control over Central Germany will give a strong impetus to the democratization of the foreign or domestic policies of these countries, and will greatly help in the proper resolution of their mutual demands and disputes. It will accelerate the victory of the people of these countries in overcoming the reactionary forces in their own countries. Once the people in these countries unite, they will resolve all foreign and domestic disputes based on the democratic principles of national peace, and therefore, the alliance of neutral small countries that defend their sovereignty and independence and resist fascist aggressors is becoming increasingly popular. This alliance, which has friendly neighborly relations and cooperates with the Soviet Union and all countries that crave peace and independence, will become a powerful factor in maintaining peace.

<h3>Aid China Movement in the Netherlands</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent V.O.) In the Netherlands, Esperanto is quite popular, especially among ordinary workers. Therefore, using Esperanto for international propaganda in the Netherlands can certainly achieve desirable results. Since the publication of the Chinese Esperanto publication "Eastern Call," it has received a great response in many countries, including the Netherlands. Dutch Esperantists often translate the materials from "Eastern Call" into Dutch and publish them in various newspapers, and they have written letters expressing sympathy and donating funds to support China. However, they felt it was not enough and were willing to hold an anti-Japanese war exhibition for China to further arouse the Dutch public's sympathy for China. "Eastern Call" agreed to their request and sent some photos (mostly provided by the International Propaganda Office and the Central News Agency). They held several exhibitions with these few photos and achieved satisfactory results. Recently, an enthusiastic Esperantist there wrote to "Eastern Call" to report on the exhibition process. The letter was full of brotherly affection and made people feel encouraged. Here is a translation of it:</p>
<p>To our comrades at "Eastern Call," last year you provided over eighty photos about China's war of resistance, which have been exhibited here many times, and the results have exceeded our expectations. The details are as follows, which you may be glad to hear:</p>
<p>First, it was held within the ninth branch of our organization, the "Dutch Workers' Esperanto Association."</p>
<p>Second, it was held at the tenth branch of the same organization, where Comrade Lange gave a passionate speech of sympathy. I did not know this gentleman before.</p>
<p>Third, it was held at the E.m.m. of the southern branch of the Dutch Metalworkers' Union. This exhibition was of great significance because the branch, under the leadership of the Dutch Aid China Movement Committee, had sent many fundraising personnel to participate in the city's fundraising campaign, raising over 12,000 guilders (equivalent to over 40,000 yuan in national currency).</p>
<p>Fourth, it was held in various educational classes in the large hall of the Association for Popular Culture in The Hague.</p>
<p>Fifth, it was displayed in rotation in the windows of a bookstore in the downtown area of Amsterdam. We plan to display it in other stores later.</p>
<p>Sixth, it was exhibited at the Krasnapolsky Building during the commemoration of Zamenhof's birthday (the creator of Esperanto was born on December 15). This exhibition was a great success, with over 900 people visiting. Their concern for China's war of resistance was astonishing. We sold thirty-one copies of the Aid China Committee's pamphlets and sixty copies of "Eastern Call." If we had more copies, we could certainly have sold them. Finally, we collected donations at the entrance, raising over ten guilders, which were all sent to the Chinese consulate to be forwarded to your government.</p>
<p>Our results can be said to be very satisfactory. Previously, the leaders of our association did not agree with our plan and took a completely bystander attitude during this exhibition. Initially, we and the representatives of the Aid China Committee who participated were not allowed to give speeches to promote public attention to our exhibition. But in the end, it aroused people's interest, and the authorities allowed us to collect donations and sell pamphlets and publications. The public's sympathy for China is active, but it remains stagnant if it is not continuously stimulated.</p>
<p>Finally, we must thank the many active male and female comrades who helped us to achieve success.</p>
<p>We made many beautiful propaganda banners, pasted photos on them, and lined them with artistic card stock and colored lace. We asked artists to write eye-catching slogans. All materials were carefully arranged and very beautiful. We also borrowed thirteen photos from the Aid China Committee. Some of your photos were not used because they were too blurry or showed nudity.</p>
<p>You wrote in your letter that you wanted to take these photos to France. But here, these photos seem to have many uses. Not only in Amsterdam, but also in other cities. Soon, we plan to visit other groups, hold exhibitions, give propaganda speeches to awaken sympathy for China, promote "Eastern Call," and cooperate with the Aid China Committee. They can present Chinese dance, music, and phonograph records, and the results will be more profound. We also feel that we need some inexpensive and useful illustrated pamphlets, perhaps you can provide them to us. Moving posters, such as those printed by Spanish Esperantists, are also very useful. Can you provide some Chinese textbooks for this purpose? We also need many photos, not only about the war, but also about China's entire culture, customs, natural scenery, transportation, women's and children's progressive activities, photos about schools, sports, art, and Chinese dignitaries, etc. These photos should not be larger than postcards. Because we have a set of projectors, when sending these photos to France, we can use them to give lectures, Chinese music, songs, and phonograph records of celebrity speeches are also very effective, and we hope you can provide some. The costs can certainly be recovered. You can print some postcards with slogans. If you have other ideas, please let us know, we are very willing to consider and implement them.</p>

<h3>The Battle in Hunan is Still Fierce, We Take a Circumferential Stance Against Nanchang, Casualties in Yueyang Exceed Two Thousand</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 30th] Approximately one regiment of the Japanese army that crossed the Gan River from Shengmi Street continued to advance towards Liangjiadu (a station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway) southeast of Nanchang on the evening of the 28th, and was intercepted by our army. They are currently in a standoff at Shabutang (a station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway between Yuntang and Liangjiadu).</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] A Chinese military spokesman, in response to a question about where the Nanchang garrison had retreated to, stated today that the Nanchang garrison is still surrounding the outskirts of Nanchang and has not withdrawn elsewhere. Chinese military strategy does not involve withdrawing troops from Japanese-occupied areas. The current troops are adopting a circumferential formation against Nanchang, attacking the Japanese troops in the city at any time, and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Meanwhile, fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese forces continued yesterday in the Nanchang area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 30th] Among the battles in northern Jiangxi, the defense of Wuning was the most tragic and heroic. All defending troops were able to display the highest degree of resilience and a spirit of revenge. The Japanese began attacking Wuning from the 20th, with a force of about one and a half divisions, advancing along the Ruiwu Highway and the Ruoxi-Wuning section. Our defending troops fought fiercely for ten days and nights. The Japanese, according to their own admissions, suffered the loss of two regimental commanders killed in action and two other senior unit commanders severely wounded. The casualties among soldiers are even more imaginable. Our army used the hills on both sides of the highway to check the Japanese advance. Every meter was fought with bayonets. After achieving satisfactory results, they began to retreat. To this day, the outer defenses of Wuning are still in our hands. South of the city, facing the Xiushui River, all our officers and soldiers are engaging in a bloody battle against the Japanese on the other side of the Xiushui River with the ambition to shake the mountains. The bravery and heroism of our troops in the past ten days has astonished even the Japanese. According to a Japanese broadcast heard here yesterday, reporting on the resistance encountered in the capture of Wuning and their praise for our army, only Yan Haiwen, the heroic pilot of our air force in the Battle of Shanghai, was described with such words. This proves that our troops in Wuning swore to resist to the death, using their advantages to put up a fierce resistance.</p>

<p>Shanxi Implements New Strategy, Expands Guerrilla Warfare, With Few Against Many Near Fenyang, Heroic Achievements Will Forever Be Remembered in History</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 29th] Zhou Ming, a platoon leader of a guerrilla detachment of our army, led thirty soldiers to advance towards Er'ya, Jiaocheng after launching a new strategy in Qianzhuang, Fenyang on the morning of the 19th. While passing through Fengjiaya Bottom, they learned that more than a thousand Japanese troops were opening Wucheng Town from Fenyang West.

It is reported that initially the guerrillas only captured six missionaries, but later the bishop of the church personally went to negotiate for their release, and the guerrillas also detained him together. It is said that the guerrillas captured the missionaries not for ransom, but because the missionaries were using Japanese military currency, which is currently circulating in the area.</p>
<h3>Chairman of Standard Chartered Bank Reports on Business Conditions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] The "Financial Times" stated that Willis, chairman of Standard Chartered Bank, stated at the bank's annual meeting today that events in China and India have made it necessary for him to adopt banknotes with considerably limited value. The reason for the devaluation of the Chinese currency is due to the withdrawal of deposits. Therefore, Standard Chartered Bank's business in China is not inferior to that of HSBC. A "Times" financial correspondent stated, "Willis' description of China's situation is of great hope for the development of China and the world, because China is making extraordinary efforts to establish a new economic system in the western provinces, enabling millions of businessmen from the Yangtze River Basin to develop this rich and undeveloped region."</p>
<h3>Japanese Construction of Railway in Northern Henan, Completion Date Uncertain, Constantly Destroyed by Us</h3>

<h3>Shanxi Pingle Land - People Capture Japanese Pilot Barehanded - Military Commission Gives Awards to Encourage - Requests the National Government to Issue Special Certificates</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] According to a telegram from the political department of the Shanxi Southern Maojin Division, the army shot down a Japanese bomber on the 28th. The Japanese pilot, Yamada, fired a gun and resisted arrest in an attempt to escape. Then, Fan Bitao, a citizen of Pinglu, bravely rushed forward. When Yamada was loading his gun, he tightly hugged his waist. Yamada struck Fan's head fiercely with the pistol grip, causing blood to flow all over his face, but he still refused to let go. Later, the troops arrived and were able to capture him alive. Fan had no official position, but his hatred of the Japanese was deep, and he did not care for his own safety. This is commendable. The Military Commission has given him an award in accordance with the regulations and requested the National Government to give him a special certificate of commendation. In addition, Lin Shu of the department persuaded Yamada to realize his errors and surrender, and publicly spoke about the crimes of the Japanese warlords, and translated the Prime Minister's will into Japanese. Ding Jiu, a clerk, incited the masses to capture the pilot. Both are models for government personnel and have been given a major merit to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Handling Measures for Secured Consolidated Tax Bonds, Spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Adds Explanation</h3>
<p>Loans from Britain and France Will Still Be Paid on Time; Measures to Solve Other Debts Are Being Considered</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The spokesman of the Ministry of Finance made further explanations today regarding Minister Kong's statement on March 26 regarding the handling of debts secured by consolidated tax. The main points are roughly divided into three points: (1) Before the negotiations between the government and relevant parties are completed, the consolidated bonds secured by salt tax should be implemented in accordance with January 15. The same method applies to the consolidated bonds secured by customs duties. In other words, a portion of the debts secured by salt tax will be handled by the Central Bank in a separate account. (2) The British and French loans due on April 5 will still be paid on time because the paying agency had previously received funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance, which were sufficient for payment. However, this can only be regarded as a special event. (3) The government is currently negotiating with the representatives of the creditors, striving to find a suitable and practical solution under the current situation to maintain creditworthiness.</p>
<h3>Western Highway Construction</h3>
<p>— Bi Cen</p>
<p>A Great Leap Forward, Mostly Completed - Six More International Routes Opened</p>
<p>[Kunming Special Aviation Dispatch] Highway construction is much easier than railway construction. Because the materials needed for highways are mostly domestically produced, and consist largely of earth and stone works, highway development is currently easier than railway development in our country. Now, the two major highway networks in the Southwest and Northwest have been largely completed. Before the railway network is completed, this is indeed a convenient transportation tool, both internally and externally.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, there were already over 27,000 kilometers of highways completed before the war. Since the outbreak of the war, many more routes have been completed. Currently, there are: (1) the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, from Chengdu through Ziyang, Zizhong, and Rongchang to Chongqing, about 450 kilometers long. (2) the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, from Guiyang through Zunyi and Tongzi to Chongqing, about 500 kilometers long. (3) the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway, from Kunming through Pingyi to Guiyang, over 600 kilometers long, connecting with the Sichuan-Guizhou and Chengdu-Guizhou routes to reach Chongqing and Chengdu. (4) the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway (Xuzhou-Kunming Highway), from Xuzhou in Sichuan to Kunming, is currently under construction. The section from Xuanwei to Weining has already been completed, and the entire route will soon be open to traffic. (5) the Yunnan-Burma Highway, starting from Kunming, passing through Xiaguan, Yongchang, Longling, and Mengyu to Lashio. The section from Kunming to Xiaguan, a total of 275 miles long, was opened to traffic three years ago. The remaining 340+ miles from Xiaguan to Lashio began construction in December of the year before last and is now complete. The designers of this road were entirely Chinese, and the work was done entirely with manpower, with almost no use of even the simplest machinery. Therefore, a correspondent from the London Times said: "What has been completed is excellent work, that only the Chinese could have achieved." The completion of this road has shortened the time of Sino-British traffic considerably. It takes a maximum of five days to travel from Kunming to Burma. (6) the Hunan-Guizhou Highway, from Changsha in Hunan through Huangxian to Guiyang. (7) the Hunan-Guangxi Highway, from Hengyang through Lingling to Guilin. (8) the Sichuan-Guangxi Highway, from Liuzhou through Guiyang, reaching Chongqing or Chengdu. (9) the Sichuan-Hunan Highway, from Changde through Yuanling, reaching Fuling or Chongqing. (10) the Guangxi-Vietnam Highway, from Liuzhou through Yongning, reaching Zhennanguan and Lang Son in Annam. (11) the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway, from Shaanxi [blanks in original] through Chengdu and [blanks in original], this is the only connecting route between the Southwest and Northwest. In addition, there are highways between Guizhou, Sichuan, and provinces [blanks in original], too numerous to list.</p>
<p>In the Northwest, in addition to the Shaanxi-Kangding Highway connecting to the Southwest, with [blanks in original] as the center: (1) the Xi-Lan Highway, from Gaolan through Dingxi, Longde, and Pingliang to Xi'an, a total of 700 kilometers long. The road surface is paved with pebbles, making driving very convenient. (2) the Gan-Xin Highway, from Gaolan through Yongdeng, Gulang, Yongchang, Jiuquan, and Yumen, out of Xingxing Gorge, then through Hami and Dihua to reach Tacheng, a total of 2,800 kilometers long, connecting to Soviet Central Asia. It is the only international transportation line in Northwest China. At the same time, the section from Gaolan to Jiuquan is the most resource-rich area. (3) the Gan-Chuan Highway, starting from Huajialing on the Xi-Lan Highway, passing through Tongwei, Tianshui, and Wudu to reach Guangyuan in Sichuan, connecting with the Shaanxi-Gan Highway, about 700 kilometers long. (4) the [blanks in original]-Lan Highway, from Fengxiang in Shaanxi to [blanks in original] Lanzhou, over 400 kilometers long. (5) the Gan-Ning Highway, from Gao Lan through Jingyuan to Ningxia, about 380 kilometers long. Unfortunately, due to the fall of Sui province [sic] [missing character], construction could not be started. (6) the Gan-Qing Highway, from Gaolan to Xining, about 280 kilometers long, is a massive project and has not yet been built. (7) the Shaanxi-Sui Highway, from Xi'an or Xianyang through Sanyuan, Luochuan, Fushi, and Yulin to reach Huanyuan. The area passing through Fushi and Yan'an is where the Eighth Route Army headquarters is located. Since the [missing character] Japanese invaded Shanxi, although they have often attempted to cross the river to the west [missing character], they have not succeeded, which is due to the Eighth Route Army constantly inflicting heavy blows. Yan'an has very [missing character] rich oil reserves, but new methods of extraction have not yet been used. Recently, the Ministry of Communications, in order to improve the transportation efficiency of the Southwest and Northwest routes, has issued orders to various road bureaus and companies to actively improve road surfaces, build bridges, add vehicles, expand repair shops, store [missing character] self-made parts, and use domestic substitutes as much as possible, in order to reduce the outflow of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In short, the torrent of the War of Resistance has made all undertakings in our country make great progress, especially in transportation construction. From the brief description above, we can already see a general outline. Although the Southwest and Northwest railway network is still under construction and not yet completed, there are already highways, shipping, telecommunications, water transportation, and pack animals to supplement it. Once completed, not only can all the abundant resources in the Southwest and Northwest be developed, enhancing our inexhaustible material and financial resources in the long-term war of resistance, but also six international transportation routes have been opened: one can go from Kunming to Rangoon; two can go from Kunming to Haiphong; three can go from Liuzhou to Haiphong; four can go from [blanks in original] Lanzhou to Istanbul in Turkey; five can go from Gaolan via the Western Turkish Railway to Northern Europe; and six can go from [blanks in original] Lun via the Siberian Railway to echo Moscow and Vladivostok in the Soviet Union. Since invading China, the Japanese [missing character] have used tremendous effort to try to blockade our coastal [missing character], but we have the strength, and we have the methods.</p>

<h3>New Paths for Guangdong Politics (3)</h3>
<p>— Li Yuzhong</p>
<p>Special Correspondent, Yun Guan</p>
<p>5.  Are People's Organizations Sound?</p>
<p>The advantages of Guangdong's self-defense [missing character] is that it first has universal organization. Some places have also established "Special Task Force Squads" as model basic units. The most obvious wartime self-defense corps have bravely carried out the battle to defend their homeland [missing character] and drive out the Japanese. However, there are still many weaknesses: (1) the leading organs are unsound, and the leaders are not virtuous [missing character]. (2) the organization is not strict, and many organizations exist only in name. (3) the general self-defense corps only take compulsory military training, and political training is particularly lacking. (4) the people regard the self-defense corps as [missing character] soldiers, thinking that participating in the self-defense corps is being a soldier. They do not trust the government. (5) there are many names for the self-defense corps organization, making their responsibilities not specific, causing these weaknesses: 1. It is a draft-style conscription, not political mobilization. 2. The quality and quantity of cadres responsible for military and political training are not enough.</p>
<p>B. How to Reform Guangdong Politics</p>
<p>1. Political Aspect</p>
<p>(1) How to Make Politics Coordinate with Military Affairs</p>
<p>Government Side: (1) It is necessary to show a firm determination to lead the war of resistance to the end, eliminate all wavering elements, and consolidate the anti-Japanese national united front. (2) Implement civil rights during the war of resistance, especially the realization of the program of national construction during the war of resistance, giving the people various freedoms; establish political participation councils at all levels to help and promote the development of the war of resistance movement, and establish the foundation of democratic politics. (3) Eliminate conspiracies in politics, saboteurs who deliberately undermine military-civilian cooperation, and provoke the opposition between the people and the government. (4) Establish organizations for regular liaison between the party, government, military, and public opinion organs. (5) Make good use of educated youth and go deep into rural work. (6) Provide relief, organization, and education to the poor and refugees. (7) Improve the people's lives as much as possible. (8) Eliminate corruption. (9) Strengthen the political education of civil servants. (10) Improve the military service system and gradually abolish the draft method. (11) Eradicate bureaucratic habits.</p>
<p>Military Side: (1) Strengthen the political education of soldiers, especially the establishment of conscious discipline in the army and raise national consciousness. (2) Implement military-civilian agreements, starting from the army. (3) Strengthen the disintegration of Japanese [missing character] puppet work. (4) Reform and enrich military and political education to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance. (5) Increase the status of political workers, establish the prestige of the political department, and wash away the past concept of treating political instructors as peddlers. (6) Political instructors should also be combatants, and military officers should be models of the military's political regulations. (7) Personnel from both the military and political sides need to obtain close [missing character] ties. Military officers must attend political meetings in the troops, and political workers should do the same in military meetings.</p>
<p>People's Side: (1) Sincerely support the government, resist the war to the end, resolutely implement government decrees, and actively participate in the war of resistance work. (2) Practice thrift, actively produce, and enrich the strength of the war of resistance. (3) Maintain rear area security. (4) Automatically eliminate traitors. (5) Do not make excessive demands on the government, but help the government overcome all difficulties in the war of resistance. (6) Educated youth should automatically go deep into the countryside and play a role as a model of hard work and endurance. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Invites Ambassadors of Three Countries for Talks - Attempts to Adjust Japanese Relations with Three Countries - Hiranuma and Konoe Discuss Internal and External Situations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th] It is reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has invited the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to his residence on the 31st for "diplomatic talks." The nature of the talks has not been revealed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Tokyo News: Yesterday, Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Minister Without Portfolio Konoe. They discussed internal Japanese problems and European problems for a long time. On April 1, when Konoe returns to Tokyo, the two sides will meet again. All parties attach great importance to the talks between Hiranuma and Konoe this time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita recently invited the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to hold talks tomorrow. The nature of the talks has not been announced, but all parties attach great importance to them. Some in diplomatic circles believe that Arita may be responding to the note submitted by the ambassadors of the three countries last year regarding the protection of the interests of all countries in China. On the other hand, it is believed that Arita may notify democratic countries that if democratic countries do not provide economic assistance to Japan's development in China, Japan will change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance according to the demands of Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Tokyo News: The Japanese Ministry of Communications announced that starting April 1, telegrams sent to European and American countries will cost 2 yen and 55 sen per word.

<p>[Haitong Agency, 30th, Tokyo] Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma told reporters yesterday that the national policy of the Japanese Empire will follow the steps taken by the Konoe Cabinet. Regarding the development of the Anti-Comintern Pact, it is still unable to be announced. Due to differences in personality, Japan does not belong to the democratic group, nor is it a member of the totalitarian state [missing character]. Hiranuma continued, saying that adjusting Japan's relations with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is a difficult problem. Although this problem must be solved, no effective method has been found so far. Regarding the establishment of a puppet central political [missing character] in China, Hiranuma said that Japan must actively prepare, because the provisional governments in both Beiping and Nanjing feel that their power is insufficient. The Japanese Prime Minister also said that the cabinet may be reorganized, with Konoe Fumimaro as minister without portfolio.</p>

<h3>French Prime Minister Broadcasts - Willing to Cooperate with Major Powers - Maintain Peace and Jointly Resist Aggression - Determined Not to Accept Italian Demands</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] "Everyone is wondering whether our country is not threatened and whether our neighbors are reliable," this is the opening statement of French Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast speech here tonight. It is said that it is precisely this state of uncertainty that has led European countries to implement precautionary steps. Treaties have not been signed without purpose, but they have not yet been implemented. Treaties no longer exist, because such treaties may provide protection to one party, but become an obstacle to the other. Those who do nothing feel like accomplices to violence, while those who do something fear provoking violent conflict. As a result, military frenzy everywhere has destroyed all other activities. Under this situation, the more one worries, the deeper the worry becomes. Those who expand their military seek super-special equipment, and the danger of war is imminent. France hopes for peace. At this time of dangerous omens, it has restored its material and spiritual unity. France's solidarity today is unprecedented, and France's determination and strength today are also unprecedented. It still believes that peace can be saved. However, if nothing but war can avoid extinction and humiliation, then the entire French nation will surely leap up and fight to the death to defend freedom. As a result of recent measures, France's economic position has improved and its national defense is as solid as gold. France's recovery has not yet arrived. Yesterday it still felt difficult, but today it has gained four tons of gold in one day. The whole people respond to the government's call with ten thousand valleys responding, and its resolute spirit is as enthusiastic as the glorious history of previous national crises. We will never allow force to dominate international relations, but when justice is extinct, force will inevitably become a responsibility. But a peaceful and powerful France has great confidence in the future. France has always shown goodwill to Germany, but Germany's sudden invasion of Czechoslovakia this time has dealt a great blow to France's peaceful goodwill. The French Prime Minister invited major powers sympathetic to France to cooperate jointly, on the one hand preparing to cooperate to maintain peace, and on the other hand preparing to jointly resist aggression. Daladier finally said: "We absolutely cannot accept Mussolini's argument, because every new plunder will be followed by new demands."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] French Prime Minister Daladier gave a broadcast speech in Paris tonight. All necessary [missing character] measures here have been completed to convey the speech in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Arabic. Daladier described the current strength of France as the sole value of the past. The whole country is rich and evenly distributed, supporting the government, and the land is fertile, so there is no need to fear famine. In the vast French colonies all over the world, I felt the enthusiasm for supporting the French government during my tenure as Colonial Minister more than fifteen years ago. The greatness of France lies not only in its strong military power, but also in our spiritual and moral values. Today, our country's strength can be compared with any period in our country's history. We tirelessly pursue human dignity, freedom, and order. All people naturally unite to pursue truth and justice. Now, freedom is called slavery, surrendering to an ideal is called surrender, the desire for life is called despair, and progress represents the destruction of human values. The false service for the safety of the masses is precisely the regression of mankind. France maintains absolute calm in the face of the surrounding harassment and demands, because it knows that negotiation will allow its rights to be clearly expressed, and violent actions against France will be shattered. " Daladier spoke about French-Italian relations in the most frank terms. He recalled the French-Italian agreement of January 7, 1935, in which Italy could obtain certain non-territorial and border rights and economic benefits, and stipulated the status of Italy in Tunisia in 1945, 1955, and 1965. "This agreement has never been questioned. It was not until December 17, 1938, that we received an unexpected notification from Foreign Minister Ciano stating that the Italian side no longer recognized the validity of this agreement. This notification did not detail Italy's demands, nor did it raise the issues of the Suez, Gibraltar, and Tunisia. The main argument of the Italian side is that Italy has acquired new rights since the conquest of Abyssinia. We cannot accept this argument. The significance of this is that every new conquest establishes new rights, and every demand that is satisfactorily answered is followed by future demands. France is now prepared to faithfully implement the 1935 agreement. Within the spirit expressed in this agreement, France will give due consideration to any suggestions. " It is rumored that the 94,000 Italians, 108,000 French, and 2.5 million Muslims in Tunisia are being mistreated, which is untrue. On the contrary, the Italians there enjoy absolute freedom. I believe that my words will have a sympathetic response in friendly countries across the European continent and the Atlantic Ocean, so I can hope that all rational people in the world will listen to these reasonable words. If they can eliminate threats, they will listen to these words, so it is not searching for shame on anyone."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] French Prime Minister Daladier issued a broadcast speech today, stating that the responsibility for resolving the French-Italian dispute lies with the Italian side, and expressing his refusal to make land concessions in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 29th] Senior officials of the Fascist Party believe that Daladier's speech has rejected Mussolini's recent speech expressing an attempt to resolve the French-Italian dispute, which is generally considered unexpected.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] All French newspapers, whether extreme left or extreme right, unanimously praised Daladier's speech, believing that the entire France has been united under the leadership of Prime Minister Daladier. "Le Journal" said that Daladier's speech was not only strictly worded, but also had clear and true reasons. French people will support Daladier's speech because it is completely reasonable and not provocative. France does not avoid discussion and is willing to study legitimate and</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 30th] According to today's newspaper opinion, French Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast speech disappointed German political figures. The general public also believes that the "Hamburg Free Press," which is closely related to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that Italian Prime Minister [missing character] Mussolini clarified the current situation in Germany, Zebita, Tunisia, and Suez last Sunday, and said that Italian newspapers will definitely interpret Daladier's speech [missing character] to make Italy's position clear and without doubt. The newspaper also attacked Daladier's so-called German aggressive intentions, and asked the United Kingdom and France to [missing character] rearm and adjust recent events in Central Europe. The newspaper concluded that Daladier may not believe that Europe regards France's natural situation as ordinary, which has been the case for centuries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] The newspapers here today unanimously praised Chamberlain's announcement of doubling troop increases in various locations and [missing character] Daladier's speech. Only the "Daily Mail" expressed opposition to the government relying solely on voluntary recruitment and not adopting conscription. "The Times" said that the people were pleased with the Prime Minister's announcement of increasing troops, which fully proved the unanimous demand of the people. "The Daily Mail" said that the Prime Minister's announcement of increasing troops was not only supported by the people, but also comforting. No step was more timely and appropriate than this. Regarding Daladier's speech, "The Times" said, "His speech fully represents his own determination and that of his country." Other places also unanimously detailed Daladier's firm attitude, believing that this warning is enough to alert aggressors.</p>
<h3>French Scrap Iron: Huge Quantities Shipped to Germany - The Order Newspaper Urges Immediate Prohibition to Prevent its Use in Manufacturing Shells to Return the Favor</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] The Order newspaper reports that during 1938, an average of 500,000 tons of scrap iron per month was transported from the Lorraine region of France to Germany via the Rhine River. The newspaper claims that Germany could use this scrap iron to manufacture shells to return the favor to France. This action is a long-term act of treason and should be stopped immediately. Otherwise, the Maginot Line may one day be destroyed by German aircraft made from French scrap iron.</p>

<h3>Spanish Civil War Ends: Franco's Troops Enter Valencia - US to Discuss Recognition</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] A Reuters correspondent reports that the Spanish Civil War has ended today. All towns and cities of the Republican government have surrendered to Franco. The Nationalist forces entered Valencia tonight, just hours after Colonel Casado, a member of the Republican government's National Defense Committee, announced the surrender of the city on the radio. All members of the committee, except General Miaja and Colonel Casado, have been detained in Valencia. Twenty-three Republican government aircraft arrived in Oran today, with General Miaja on board, but there is no news of Casado. News of the surrender of other towns and cities is pouring in like snowflakes. Every few minutes, it can be heard on the radio, with each broadcaster saying in unison, "This city has been taken over by General Franco and the famous Fifth Column of the Nationalist Army." It is reported that the provincial capital, Lérida, and Almería have been completely occupied by General Franco's troops, and the occupation of Jaén has also begun. At the same time, Nationalist troops have completed the encirclement of Madrid. Order has been restored in the city, and public services are operating as usual. A special dispatch from Mussolini congratulates Franco, while Ribbentrop sends a congratulatory telegram to Spanish Foreign Minister General Jordana. Mussolini has ordered the entire country to display flags from dawn to dusk to celebrate the victory of the Nationalist forces.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 29th] The Valencia radio station announced today that the city has surrendered to General Franco.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 30th] Franco's vanguard troops have arrived in Valencia. It is reported that Franco has decided to station a large air force there.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 30th] Yesterday, the radio station announced that the surrender of the Republican Army's southern forces indicates the end of the fighting in Andalusia. Currently, the Nationalist forces have smoothly entered the cities of the southern provinces without resistance. The majority of the Communist soldiers have surrendered to the Nationalist forces, while a small number have fled to the coast.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 30th] According to French newspapers, General Miaja, the former commander of the Spanish government forces, arrived at Oran airport yesterday alone on an aircraft from Valencia. Upon arrival, he was greeted by airport personnel and taken to a bedroom to sleep, as the general had not rested for three days after leaving Madrid. Subsequently, seven Spanish military aircraft arrived, carrying 54 military personnel. General Miaja took a fast train to Algiers last night.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] It is widely believed that before the US government recognizes the Franco government in Spain, it will require the Franco government to guarantee lenient treatment of the defeated government officials. This morning, Secretary of State Hull met with President Roosevelt to discuss the issue of recognizing the Franco government. The French Ambassador to the United States had a long talk with Undersecretary of State Welles, reportedly expressing France's attitude towards Italy.</p>

<h3>Eden and Others Suggest National Cabinet - Control Everything, Expand the Military as Much as Possible - Promote a Military Alliance in Eastern Europe - More Than a Hundred Members of Parliament Express Opposition</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th] Thirty-four members of the House of Commons, including former Foreign Secretary Eden, Conservative Party right-wing leader Churchill, Naval Secretary Cooper, and Conservative Party Sandys, have jointly proposed a motion urging the House of Commons to hold a discussion on this matter as soon as possible. The motion states: "This House, in view of the recurring acts of aggression in Europe, which threaten the British Empire, and the increasing pressure on small countries, considers that the situation has reached an extremely serious stage. Therefore, it believes that only by actively promoting the policies announced by Foreign Secretary Halifax can such threats be dealt with. This House also believes that, due to this situation, Britain should establish a national cabinet, the foundation of which should be as broad as possible. Once the national cabinet is established, it should be given full power to control Britain's industry, wealth, and manpower, so that the country's military expansion can achieve the greatest effect in the shortest period of time." Regarding the content of the military plan proposed by Eden and others, it is understood that (1) the plan also includes the possibility of the invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland; (2) the independence of Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia is threatened, and Britain and France should urge them to form a secret group, so that if one is invaded, the other two can provide assistance; (3) to promote the establishment of an Eastern European alliance, Britain and France should temporarily refrain from making promises, and only after the Eastern European alliance is established can Britain and France provide secret assurances, stating that if the Eastern European group can fulfill its mutual agreement, the Western European alliance can provide assistance; (4) all countries should maintain the most friendly relations with the Soviet Union, but do not want to invite the Soviet Union to participate in any restrictions, but only intend to keep it in a reserved position.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] One hundred and eighty members of the House of Commons have jointly signed a motion opposing Eden's proposal, expressing full confidence in the Prime Minister and protesting against the distrust of the Prime Minister and the government.</p>
<h3>British-German Trade Negotiations Halted - Trade Minister's Report - Members of Parliament Cheer</h3>

<h3>Bonnet Meets Polish Ambassador - Discusses German and Tense Relations - Poland Decides to Reject German Demands - Germany Builds Pillboxes on Slovak Border</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 30th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet had a long conversation with the Polish Ambassador yesterday. Political circles believe that their main discussion was about the tense relations between Germany and Poland and the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Beck to Britain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 30th] Although officials here deny that Germany has made specific demands to Poland to modify the current status of Danzig and allow passage through the Polish Corridor, it is generally believed that similar conditions were indeed delivered to the Polish Ambassador by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. However, it is understood that Poland has expressed its unwillingness to discuss such demands under the threat of force. Partial mobilization has given Poland confidence to deal with oppression. It is reported that the government is only willing to discuss the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues on the principle of mutual equality.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] According to an unofficial report, Polish Senator Colonel Mieciski stated at a secret meeting that although Germany has not yet made demands on Poland, it is expected to do so soon, and Poland will resolutely reject this demand.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 29th] Germany is currently building a line of pillboxes in Slovakia, running from north to south across the White Carpathian Mountains, about 50 miles long. This line of pillboxes is intended to protect Austria in the event of an attack from the east by other countries. It is reported that Poland is also stepping up the construction of its line of defenses on the Slovak border.</p>
<p>Poland Will Not Change Its Foreign Policy</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 30th] Yesterday, a semi-official source here replied to a question from the German diplomatic and political newspaper of Tuesday, stating that Poland's foreign policy will not change, and that Poland very much wants to abide by the German-Polish Agreement of 1934. The recent anti-German movements in various places are not related to the Polish government. The authorities believe that the German newspaper's criticism of these movements further proves that Germany also wants to consistently adhere to its past policy towards Poland. It is also said that Poland is not only concerned with domestic affairs, so the Polish people also have reactions to external changes, and a few incidents cannot be considered representative of the whole country. Regarding the Germans within Poland, the Polish authorities believe that the German newspaper's remarks are inevitably excessive. It is also said that in the past few weeks, changes in the external situation and those that Poland cares about are not entirely consistent, so Germany must understand the actions of the Polish people. Finally, whether foreign countries welcome it or not, Poland's foreign policy cannot be restricted by others.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 30th] The Speaker of the Polish Parliament, Sonteski, replied to a question from a leader of the Polish United Party yesterday, stating that Poland will not agree to the annexation of Danzig by Germany, will not agree to the construction of a highway through the Polish "Corridor," and will not agree to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. If anyone proposes this, Poland will say "No." Therefore, it was a secret meeting of party leaders, and the content of the discussion is not known.</p>
<p>German Public Opinion: Jealousy and Intimidation</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th] Although German newspapers have not yet fully published reports of the German-Polish unrest, the German diplomatic and political correspondent said, "In recent days, anti-German unrest has occurred in many places within Poland. From this, it can be seen that Polish elements oppose the principles of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact concluded by General Pilsudski and the German Chancellor in 1934. Hitler disregarded the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and strived to promote German-Polish relations, and repeatedly urged the Germans to understand the importance of Polish independence and at the same time the key to stability in the East. This is why Germany and Poland are friendly. The purpose of the 1934 German-Polish treaty is also this. If Poland now believes that its attitude towards Germany no longer needs to remain the same, in other words, the fundamental interests and honor of the German people no longer need to be taken into account, then the future of European reconciliation will inevitably lead to unfortunate results. As far as Poland itself is concerned, it will also be in danger." The "National Times," which is related to General Goering, also wrote an article on this, saying that the anti-German movement has made the German-Polish friendship treaty lose its value. The newspaper also mentioned that during the mass procession held in Braunberg on Sunday, people shouted "Advance on Danzig." German women and children were threatened on the streets for speaking German. These anti-German behaviors are clearly planned actions, so the Polish authorities cannot pretend not to know. The "Hamburg News Foreign Edition" said that Poland's joining the anti-German group that Britain is trying to form makes it difficult for German-Polish understanding to go hand in hand. Britain's attempt to build a barrier against Germany is most focused on Poland, followed by French-Soviet cooperation. Although Poland has been under pressure from outside, it still maintains its correct attitude towards Germany. It can be seen that its most fundamental reason is that German-Polish understanding does not allow anti-German incitement.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 30th] According to well-informed sources, the close contact between London and Warsaw regarding the issue of the British guarantee of Poland's territorial integrity is progressing very smoothly. It is also said that the British-Polish agreement may be concluded before Polish Foreign Minister Beck arrives in London on the 4th of next month.</p>
<h3>Kalinin's 20th Anniversary of Service</h3>
<p>[Central Agency, Moscow, 30th] Tomorrow is the 20th anniversary of the Soviet People's Committee Chairman Kalinin's service to the party and the country. He is 64 years old. For the past 20 years in politics, he has been deeply loved by the people. His contributions to improving rural life and establishing the collective farm system are especially indelible. At the recent Communist Party Congress, Kalinin also gave a speech, detailing the hardship and oppression of Japanese farmers. He was re-elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee Politburo.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Announces in the House of Commons: Decided to Increase Local Forces - Military Preparedness to Deal with Dictatorial Ambitions - Adopt Volunteer Enlistment Instead of Conscription</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] This afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that the number of local forces has now doubled. "I have previously stated that all aspects of national life, including defense procedures, will be re-examined and considered. I believe the House will recall that the government authorities, based on this attitude, believe that promoting the spirit of voluntary service is essential. Although the number of volunteers for the local forces has exceeded the set amount, they should still not be refused. Therefore, the government authorities have considered the situation and summarized it as follows: (1) The local combat forces, which are currently 140,000 in peacetime, should immediately be increased by 40,000. (2) After this doubling, the total number should reach 340,000. In addition, there are other important decisions, such as increasing supplies, increasing appropriate training personnel, replenishing all weapons and reserves, and maintaining the necessary supplies for the enhanced wartime force. All of this, I think, will be welcome news to you. The above plans are now being implemented step by step, and progress will be reported in the future. However, in order to achieve the above goals in the shortest possible time, greater efforts must be made. I believe that members of the House will be happy to do everything possible to help achieve it." When asked what impact Chamberlain's recently announced plan would have on the number of British troops sent overseas, Chamberlain said that the impact would be that the number of troops sent overseas would also be doubled.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 29th] The British government has now replaced the method of military preparedness to deal with dictatorial aggression, ordering the increase of troops stationed throughout the empire to wartime levels, totaling 340,000. Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons that the troops stationed in various places have tripled due to the enthusiastic volunteering. This increase indicates that Britain can draw large armies for foreign expeditions, currently amounting to 34 divisions, approximately 600,000 men, who can be transferred to France for combat. The War Office previously announced only 19 divisions. Chamberlain said that retired officers and resident soldiers are now being used to be responsible for training reserves. He also stated that the government has now adopted a volunteer enlistment method to replace conscription.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Dominion Minister Inskip declared in the House of Commons today that the government is now considering enacting legislation to allow residents of trust territories to obtain British citizenship. Liberal Party member Mander asked if the government is considering Britain's participation in the French-Soviet agreement. Deputy Secretary Butler replied "No."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] During the meeting of the British House of Commons today, British Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to a member of parliament's question, stating that during the recent visit of French President Lebrun to Britain, talks were held among the cabinet ministers of Britain and the representatives of France regarding the implementation of national service obligations in Britain, but he cannot announce the results of those talks to the public at this time.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Observer Writes Article on the European Situation - Polish Foreign Minister's Visit to Britain is Very Important - Germany Begins Propaganda to Prevent It</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] A diplomatic observer here wrote an article today stating, "Two important events occurred yesterday: one was the announcement by British Prime Minister Chamberlain to increase the local forces to 340,000, and the other was the broadcast speech by French Prime Minister Daladier, refusing to cede an inch of French territory and give up any rights, and also stating that he is considering any proposals from Italy. After increasing the local forces, Britain will have 26 divisions of local forces (excluding six divisions of regular troops) that can serve overseas. Therefore, in case of need, it can have a strong military force to intervene in the European situation. The authorities believe that there will be a sufficient number of volunteers to recruit soldiers, and there are several officers who can take on command positions. British political circles welcomed Daladier's speech, believing that his words were moderate, but that there could be no compromise on major aspects. In view of this speech and the speech made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last Sunday, there is much hope that Italy's demands, if not excessive, can be resolved. The next important action in European politics is the arrival of Polish Foreign Minister Beck in Britain next week. Germany has begun a propaganda campaign to prevent Beck's trip to London. It is surprising that some of the articles in this campaign have only been given to foreign reporters in Berlin and have not been published in German newspapers. Poland has clearly prepared to respond to this German campaign. Yesterday, Polish newspapers indicated that the government, the Polish party, and the opposition newspapers have expressed a common determination to deal with the German side's attacks, specifically pointing out that Poland's policy has not changed, and that Germany has abolished Syndicalism and adopted European imperialism, which will inevitably cause adverse reactions in Poland."</p>
<h3>Mussolini Tours Southern Italy Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 30th] This morning, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini took a special train to Calabria to complete his mission to tour the southernmost part of Italy last autumn. Only two cabinet members and his personal secretary accompanied him. It is reported that the Italian Prime Minister will inspect the coastal cities, first to Belmonte, and then to Cosenza, the provincial capital of Calabria.</p>
<p>Small Commentary</p>
<h3>"The End of the Spanish War"</h3>
<p>"The Spanish Civil War has officially ended"!</p>
<p>The capitalist countries have all sent out such telegrams.</p>
<p>The leaders of the aggressive countries, Germany and Italy, have sent congratulatory telegrams one after another.</p>
<p>The Republican army was forced to surrender under the international conspiracy and betrayal of traitors. The Fascist rebel army occupied Madrid and Valencia, and the Spanish war has superficially ended.</p>
<p>However, the superficial and temporary end is not the solution to the Spanish problem.</p>
<p>We do not want to predict another major war in Spain, and we also hope that Spain will unite as a whole from now on, clean up the broken mountains and rivers, eliminate the forces of aggression, and rebuild a free country. Unfortunately, unfounded hopes are just dreams! Just self-deception!</p>
<p>Let's see! Why did the Spanish people resolutely support this anti-fascist and anti-aggression war? Isn't it for the liberation of the Spanish people and the maintenance of world peace? If so, then are the two aggressive devils of Germany and Italy willing to lead and help Franco fight for thirty months in vain and then withdraw from Spain? Can the current Franco regime be regarded as a truly Spanish regime, and can it slightly violate the wishes of its masters, Germany and Italy? Can the Franco regime break away from the manipulation of foreign bourgeois governments and truly seek the independence, freedom, and happiness of Spain and its people? If we cannot confidently answer these questions, then isn't our hope that the Spanish war will truly end a dream?</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the Spanish people are fighting in the past, fighting now, and will continue to fight for the independence, freedom, and happiness of Spain until the traitors, fascists, and aggressive forces are completely eliminated—</p>
<p>We should not only not stand by and watch the tragic betrayal of the Spanish people! We must also remember the lessons of blood and tears of the Spanish experience, beware of traitors, aggressors, and all other conspiracies to compromise and mediate that are prepared to sacrifice our twenty achievements in resisting the war!</p>

<h3>×× To Cope with the State of Emergency - Legislative Council Passed Yesterday - Implementation of the Residents Registration Ordinance - British Residents Required to Register Within Two Months - New Heavy Oil Tax Regulations to Take Effect Immediately</h3>
<p>In order to cope with the state of emergency, the Hong Kong government specially formulated the British Residents Registration Ordinance through the Attorney General, requiring all British people in Hong Kong, except for Chinese people and active-duty military personnel of the army and navy, and those with special circumstances who are specially exempted by the Governor of Hong Kong, who are between the ages of 18 and 45, to register with the competent authorities, so that they can be conscripted for service in wartime. The ordinance was passed at the first reading of the Legislative Council. In order to implement it quickly, the Legislative Council convened a special meeting at 2:30 pm yesterday. Those present included Governor of Hong Kong Sir Geoffrey Northcote, Colonial Secretary Smith, Attorney General Ainsley, Secretary for Chinese Affairs Cary, Financial Secretary Keen, Harbour Master Holland, Director of Public Works Henderson, Acting Police Commissioner Barton, Army Commander Garnier, Director of Medical Services Sutu Yongjue, Sir Pollock, Zhou Junnian, Lo Man Kam, Peter Matheson, and Tam Yazhi. After the meeting was held as usual, the ordinance was submitted for the second and third readings. As a result, it has been passed according to the original plan. British residents in Hong Kong are limited to complete the registration procedures within two months from yesterday. In addition, there are eight ordinances passed in the second and third readings yesterday, in addition to the above, there are (2) the draft ordinance to prevent and punish inciting the British naval, land, and air force reserve teams, or the police, whether they are regular troops or reserve teams, to be disloyal to their duties, or betray the British King, (3) the draft ordinance to amend the 1931 Gambling Tax Ordinance, (4) the draft law to amend the qualifications of judges of the High Court and the collegiate court, (5) to enrich and amend the tax regulations on carbon compounds oil, (that is, heavy oil, commonly known as kerosene residue), (6) to authorize the rental of the sea surface opposite the Beili Street Pier and its eastern side in Victoria Street between Chengduo Liya Street and Bolingjieza Street, and the sea surface opposite the section of Kang Le Road, and to build a pier on the above-mentioned reclamation area, and to build a temporary pier between the newly reclaimed land and the Diji Lishi pier, (7) the draft amendment to the 1938 Protection of Women Ordinance, (8) the draft of the annual military expenditure quota for Hong Kong. All of the above cases were jointly proposed and passed the second and third readings by the Colonial Secretary Smith, becoming the newly formulated laws of Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>After the Outbreak of War in the Five Counties, Refugees Flocked to Hong Kong and Macau; Jiangmen-Hong Kong Postal and Telegraph Services Stalled, Making News Unclear; Vegetable Supplies Cut Off, Prices Soared</h3>
<p>The × army, which invaded Shunde, after capturing Rongqi and Guizhou, immediately advanced towards the Xin'hui county border. The war in the Five Counties thus began yesterday, the 29th. The focus of the war has shifted to Jiangmen, an important town in Xin'hui (see the South China News section for details). Last night, the Taisan and Haojiang ferries arrived in Hong Kong from Macau one after another. According to the ship's staff, due to the disruption of transportation between Jiangmen and Macau, there was no definite news about the battle for Jiangmen. However, due to the tense war situation, passengers transferring from Jiangqi to Macau and then to Hong Kong were extremely crowded. The Taisan ferry carried more than 800 passengers, and the Haojiang ferry carried more than 700 passengers. The crowded situation was rare this year. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the relationship between Jiangmen and Hong Kong has become closer, and there are also many fellow villagers from the Five Counties in Hong Kong. The fellow villagers in Hong Kong care about their hometown and are extremely concerned about the situation there. Various businesses that have traditionally traded with Jiangmen have also sent telegrams to inquire about the situation. Hong Kong society was shocked by this. Yesterday, reporters conducted investigations with various related parties in Hong Kong. According to reports,</p>
<p>Telegraph Difficulties, Postal Stagnation</p>
<p>Regarding telecommunications, the China Telegraph Office is still receiving and sending telegrams to Jiangmen. The reporter inquired with the office at 5:00 PM yesterday. According to the office, Jiangmen (belonging to Xinhui) and Qianshan (belonging to Zhongshan) both have telegraph offices. Communication between Hong Kong and these two places is usually relayed through Shaoguan. The current situation in Jiangmen is not yet known, but the office is still receiving telegrams as usual, but it does not guarantee when or if they will arrive. As for mail from Hong Kong to Jiangmen, it is transshipped through Macau. Yesterday, the Hong Kong Post Office, probably due to the chaotic situation in Jiangmen, suspended the forwarding of mail through Macau. A post office employee told reporters that parcels to Jiangmen were not refused, but were detained at the post office after acceptance and could not be sent.</p>
<p>Vegetable Supply Disrupted, Prices Double</p>
<p>Since the Jiangmen route is inaccessible, the most affected item for Hong Kong residents is vegetables. Hong Kong has a population of nearly one million, and the daily demand for vegetables is very large. A large portion needs to be supplied from the mainland, with about 20-30% supplied by Jiangmen. Therefore, as soon as the news of the suspension of transportation to Jiangmen spread, the market price of vegetables in Hong Kong immediately increased. Normally, it would cost three or four dollars per load, but yesterday it increased to seven or eight dollars per load, doubling the price. Newly produced water spinach, in particular, rose to thirty-five dollars per load. The remaining lowest prices also increased by one-third. Although villagers in various parts of Hong Kong plant vegetables, they are usually not enough to meet the demand. During this period, there is bound to be a greater shortage. If transportation is not restored, not only will there be a risk of further price increases, but it is also feared that it will be impossible to get them on the market at all. The price of freshwater fish has also increased from 40 cents to 60 cents per catty yesterday, due to the gradual decrease in supply.</p>
<h3>Two Major British and French Liners Collide in Fog Outside Hong Kong; The French Liner "Guangdong" Has a Hole and is Taking on Water, but Fortunately, It is Not Seriously Damaged; The "Chaffee" is Slightly Damaged and Also Returns to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The French liner "Guangdong", from the Iron Shipping Company sailing from Shanghai to the south, and the French mail ship "General Chaffee", which was going north from Hong Kong, collided at about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, about 130 miles from Hong Kong, at Suibo Point between Hong Kong and Shantou, due to fog. Shortly afterwards, Hong Kong received telegrams from both ships reporting that the "Guangdong" was taking on water in the middle and was more seriously damaged than the French mail ship, but fortunately it was not seriously damaged. After the incident, it was still able to come to Hong Kong on its own and is expected to arrive last night or this morning. The "Chaffee" also returned to Hong Kong and is scheduled to enter the dock for inspection. The French mail ship that had the accident weighed 13,000 tons and carried 167 passengers. French Ambassador to China, Gossamer, happened to be on board to Shanghai. It is unknown whether there is a need to enter the dock after the incident, and it will only be known after arriving in Hong Kong. The British mail ship weighed 16,000 tons and was one of the fastest new ships built by the Iron Shipping Company. It first came east in November last year for its maiden voyage. It is not known how severe the injury is this time. It is said that there are three holes. After arriving in Hong Kong, it is necessary to enter the dock for repairs for three or four days. For this reason, the Iron Shipping Company specially ordered the Zhiduo, which was scheduled to open to Shanghai yesterday, to remain in Hong Kong temporarily. After the "Guangdong" arrives in Hong Kong, see how many days it will take to enter the dock, and if it is believed that the injury is too serious and cannot be repaired in three or four days, then the Zhiduo will stop going to Shanghai and Japan, and carry the passengers of the "Guangdong" back to Europe, and the "Guangdong" will go to Shanghai and Japan for it.</p>
<h3>Three Magistrates Robbed One After Another; Magistrate Fu and Magistrate He Lost Before; Magistrate Yi Was Also Patronized Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Robbery and Theft Are Rampant in Hong Kong and Kowloon; Baledro and Luo Xuhe Met Yesterday to Discuss Countermeasures; Preparing to Increase Police Officers to Maintain Public Security</h3>
<p>Robbery and theft have become rampant in Hong Kong recently. Hardly a day goes by without robbery or looting on the road. It seems that it has gradually been proven that a large group of organized thieves is hiding in Hong Kong. Since the news of the gang's attempt to rob a wealthy family on Prince Edward Road in Kowloon was published, people have felt quite terrified, and the robbers are now getting more and more fierce. A robbery even took place in front of the police dormitory the other day, which is shocking. According to reporters, the Hong Kong government has ordered the police authorities to strictly search and arrest these lawless thieves. Yesterday morning, the acting police chief Baledro and the Legislative Council member Sir Luo Xu discussed the issue of arresting thieves and ensuring public security. In the afternoon, Sir Luo met with reporters. He said that the number of people in Hong Kong has increased greatly recently, and there are both good and bad people. Robbery cases will naturally increase. I understand that the police superintendent is extremely concerned about this matter and is trying to deal with it. The government is also considering increasing the police force to maintain public security. It is also understood that the number of police officers stationed in Hong Kong seems to be unable to adapt to the actual needs, which is what the general public feels at present, so that thieves are unscrupulous. It is a common fact that the police officers arrive long after the police whistle has been sounded.</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Automobile Association Asks the Authorities to Plan to Build Three-Dimensional and Tunnel Parking Lots; Tunnel Parking Lots Can Be Used for Both Parking and Air Defense</h3>
<p>At the annual meeting of the Hong Kong Automobile Association the other day, Chairman Balingmei said in his speech that the parking lots in the Central District are extremely crowded due to the sharp increase in automobiles. There should be an ideal parking lot plan to remedy this. One plan is to build a four- or five-story high-rise building in the Central District, parking cars on each floor. The building is equipped with giant elevators for transportation up and down. Plan two is also to build a five-story high-rise building, but instead of using elevators to transport cars, there is a ramp around the building leading to each floor, and cars go up and down the ramp. These two plans are for the design of three-dimensional parking lots. This method has long been implemented in England. Hong Kong has not yet seen it due to environmental reasons. Of course, private individuals cannot afford to carry out this kind of equipment, so it is best for the government to do it and hand it over to the Association for management. The problem of crowded parking lots at present needs to be resolved urgently, and we should not underestimate this social undertaking. There is also a third plan, which is to equip a tunnel parking lot and open up a mountainside parking lot. This plan is favored by the Air Defense Commissioner, Shi Dilubojian. Because it can be used for parking in peacetime, and can also be used as an air-raid shelter in emergencies. If this plan can be completed, all the difficulties in parking cars can be solved. The chairman now hopes that all committee members will work hard to cooperate with the government to achieve the ideal parking lot plan.</p>

<h3>The Hong Kong Prison Report is Published; All Prisons Suffer from Overcrowding; The Number of Male and Female Prisoners Reaches More Than 4,300; The Prison System Has Not Yet Reached the Standard</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong 1938 Prison Officer's Report was published in the Legislative Council meeting yesterday afternoon. According to the Prison Officer's opinion, although the Hong Kong prison system has improved compared to the past, it has not yet reached the standard to meet the current needs. If it is to be as perfect as in the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire, a large amount of funding is necessary. The report briefly stated:</p>
<p>Prisoner Statistics</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Victoria Men's Prison was abolished in 1937. Since 1938, there have been only two prisons in Hong Kong, one is the Stanley Men's Prison and the other is the Lai Chi Kok Women's Prison. When the male prisoners of the Victoria Prison and the Lai Chi Kok Prison moved to Stanley, there were a total of 2,215 people. The number increased to 1,757 in November 1937. On January 1 last year, there were a total of 2,339 prisoners in the Stanley Men's Prison, including 18 Westerners, 8 Indians, and 2,313 Chinese. The highest number recorded was 2,908 on December 23. The number on December 31 was 2,844. The Lai Chi Kok Women's Prison had a total of 2,001 people last year.</p>
<p>Implementation of Labor</p>
<p>Both men's and women's prisons are currently overcrowded. The previous plan of one prisoner per room has failed and has now become three prisoners per room. A plan was proposed again in August last year to reform the prison system and reduce the number of prisoners. Part of this plan was approved by the government in October and is scheduled to be implemented within the year. The men's prison plans to implement prisoner labor, which will not only reduce the number of prisoners, but also allow prisoners to engage in productive work. The women's prison plans to build more prison cells, but it has not been able to proceed due to lack of funding.</p>

<p>Recently, various groups in Hong Kong have launched a debt-burning campaign to show the people's eagerness to buy public bonds and their heavenly duty to serve the country without expecting the government to repay the debt, which is commendable. The Foreign Affairs Trade Union launched the second debt-burning campaign yesterday, with participants including the Printing Industry Trade Union, the Chinese Clerks Association, the Amateur Social Club, and the Chinese Machine Workers Trade Union. The details are as follows: (1) The Foreign Affairs Trade Union advised its members to register the public bonds they bought with the union and burn them on schedule.

<h3>Extending Salvation and Propaganda from the Front Lines to Overseas; Salvation Drama Troupe Will Go Abroad (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Outstanding Sons and Daughters of the Chinese Nation: Interview with Jinshan and Wang Ying</p>
<p>Wang Ying's Touching Words</p>
<p>After the other guests who interviewed them left, Mr. and Mrs. Jin Lin invited the reporter from the reception room to their room, which was also their temporary office, to meet Ms. Wang Ying.</p>
<p>We have long admired Ms. Wang Ying, who "jumped out of the dark film circle" to study in Japan. She is not only a star, but also a progressive new woman. Over the years, she has worked hard under the artillery fire of the × army and has deserved to be a fighter for national liberation. Meeting her, from her attitude and expression, even more shows that the soul of the Chinese nation is entrusted to these outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>After the introduction, Ms. Wang enthusiastically, gently, sincerely, and optimistically told the reporter:</p>
<p>"China's progress is really fast! If it weren't for the war of resistance, 30 or 40 years would not have been able to exchange for this unprecedented progress!"</p>
<p>Ms. Wang opened the conversation softly and kindly, not deliberately emphasizing it like a propagandist, but with the true and reliable evidence of personal experience:</p>
<p>That is really rare! There are many young people serving in the army, they overcome their past comfortable living habits, their clothes are very casual, and their diet is very simple. All that occupies their minds is the revival of the motherland, and there is not a moment of rest in their lives.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang said more energetically:</p>
<p>"The phenomenon of the army and the people becoming one is also becoming more and more inspiring. The people give up their rooms for the army to live in, and also do all kinds of work for them. Young men and women, or old women, children go to the army to see them, help them, and live with them, it's simply like a family.</p>
<p>"I remember it was in the place of Xinjian'ao, where the old forces of the landlord and gentry class were very strong. When we started our work, we sincerely said to them: We will not do things that you disagree with. We are here to serve the people and have no prejudice whatsoever. The landlords looked at our work plan, sympathized with us, and allowed the villagers to watch our plays. Thousands of people poured in from all over the countryside at once. They watched the plays with fascination and became addicted, so they carried white rice from their homes. After watching the plays, they cooked rice in the open space where the plays were performed. They even slept in front of the stage at night, and some slept under the stage. They were very moved after performing like this for several nights in a row. One landlord voluntarily went on stage to give a speech, and the progress in his attitude was really beyond our expectations. After watching the plays, many people questioned us: Are these things you are acting really true? Or are they fake? So we showed them pictures of the × army raping, looting, bombing, and robbing. Some women covered their eyes and did not want to watch anymore, and they all cursed: How can there be such unconscionable ×××× in the world? If they come, will we still be polite to them? We must fight them to the death."</p>
<p>——The reporter was deeply moved when he heard this. A look of satisfaction was still etched between Ms. Wang's lips and eyebrows. She said eloquently:</p>
<p>"We seized this opportunity, put on clothes like the common people, and went to visit them separately. We harvested rice for them, helped them wash clothes, and naturally propagated to them from their real lives. The people are really lovely! If we hadn't gone to the front lines and deep into the remote countryside, we wouldn't have been able to understand the real China, and we wouldn't have been able to be sure that China has a glorious future, and that final victory is beyond doubt." ——Their firm beliefs and work attitude are really worthy of emulation by general salvation workers.</p>
<p>"Wherever we passed, the × army chased after us. When the sound of cannons in Xinjian'ao was getting closer and closer, we left to work elsewhere. Although the area was lost, the people and the Self-Defense Army rose up together to fight guerrilla warfare, and the results were very good. The big landlords have land and fields, and once they are occupied, they are as poor as ordinary people, so the landlords and peasants closely unite and fight the × army desperately, causing a major threat to the × army.</p>
<p>"The war of resistance is indeed a rebirth on one side and destruction on the other. All corrupt and backward systems and people are being eliminated in the artillery fire!</p>
<p>Ms. Wang said here, emphasizing her tone and becoming particularly excited. The reporter also responded with a knowing smile.</p>
<p>"We have been running around for more than a year, and we feel that we have made a lot of progress ourselves. We are very happy and very optimistic."</p>
<p>After listening to Ms. Wang's touching words, we were more ashamed of our own work and our own lives in the progress of our motherland. We are still far away from the sacred war of resistance in our motherland.</p>
<p>It is said that the cultural and drama circles in Hong Kong will hold a warm welcome meeting to express their sincere congratulations and to communicate the cultural exchanges between the group at home and abroad. The reporter also wants to send a message to the aspiring young men and women in Hong Kong to get close to them and learn from them, which is a great opportunity for self-absorption and learning (End)</p>
<h3>YWCA Lecture; Mr. Jin Zhonghua Speaks on "New Hopes in the Current World Situation"; Ms. Wang Ying Will Be Invited to Speak Next Week</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Hong Kong YWCA holds academic lectures every Thursday. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, Mr. Jin Zhonghua, editor-in-chief of World Knowledge and Sing Tao Daily, was invited to speak on "New Hopes in the Current World Situation." Ms. Liang Shude translated it into Cantonese. He explained thoroughly the hopes for new forces in the war of resistance, the hopes for new awakenings, and the hopes for the unity of democratic countries and peace-loving people to sanction the forces of aggression. He said that the elimination of aggressive countries and the coming of freedom and equality are the inevitability of evolution, and we must still add human power to promote their early realization. Clearing up the pessimistic tone of defeatists is also the current task. The listeners were very inspired by his eloquent exposition. After the lecture, the listeners were free to ask questions, and Mr. Jin answered them sincerely. The atmosphere of exploring learning was very intense. After the meeting, more than a dozen students from the Zhenguang Girls' High School asked Mr. Jin to answer their questions again. Their spirit of thirst for knowledge is commendable. It is heard that the YWCA will next invite Ms. Wang Ying, a progressive film and drama artist who has just arrived in Hong Kong from the mainland, to speak about her experience serving on the front lines. It is expected that young men and women in Hong Kong will definitely go to listen to the lecture enthusiastically at that time.</p>

<h3>A Heroic Page of Jiangmen: Large-Scale Invasion by × Land, Sea, and Air; Fierce Battle for Control, We Regain Possession; Our Troops Fight Bravely in Several Melee Encounters with ×; Heavy Losses on Both Sides, Casualties Equal</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After × resolved to invade Jiangmen, × planes frantically bombed Jiangmen all day on the 28th. On the morning of the 29th, × warships bombarded the Jiangwei area. At 1:15 PM, over 500 × soldiers, under the cover of × warship artillery, charged towards Beijie. Our troops fought bravely, engaging in fierce battle for several hours. The enemy forces became exhausted, and our troops vigorously advanced, finally driving out the stubborn ×. By 6:00 PM, our troops had completely recovered the area. On the morning of the 30th, × warships again heavily bombarded Jiangwei. Under the cover of superior firepower, most of the × army charged fiercely towards Beijie again. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented in the Guangdong resistance war. To avoid excessive sacrifice, our side temporarily withdrew to the rear at 2:00 PM to prepare for a more vigorous counterattack, it is said.</p>
<p>Forces Returning from All Directions Drive × Out of the City</p>
<p>[Macau Express News] On the 29th, × troops attacked Jiangmen in four ways by land and water, occupying Baigaijiao, Zhutoushan, Dongmaning and other places in the Xinhui-affiliated Waihai area. The various units of our Fifth Guerrilla Zone, the Xinshun Special Task Force, the Jiangfang Command of Zhu Keqin, and a part of the Guangzhou Guerrilla Mobile Unit, fought bravely, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The battle continued until 3:00 PM, when the × army resumed its full-scale advance, sending 28 planes to bomb Jiangmen, dropping dozens of bombs. The sound of explosions mixed with the sounds of cannons and battle cries, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. Our troops bravely held their ground, but due to excessive casualties, they had to retreat slightly. A part of the × army entered Jiangmen city, but our troops continued street fighting. Each demolition squad was instructed to immediately destroy all buildings and set fires in various locations if the city could not be held. Although a part of the × army entered the city, they did not expect our troops to fight even more fiercely, charging back and forth. Because of the chaotic battle, × planes could not effectively deploy their firepower. Our district teams leaped into melee combat several times. Around 6:00 PM, the special task force and the Fourth Detachment, rushing to Zengshan for reinforcements, heard the alarm and returned to their posts. In addition, a part of Yuan's forces from Zhongshan arrived from Muzhou and immediately joined forces to fight the ×, advancing one after another. Finally, relying on the bravery of the soldiers, all the × were driven out of the city. The Fifth Detachment divided its forces to encircle the area near Beijie. The × retreated hastily towards Chaolian Waihai and other places. Our troops pursued closely. Most of the × engaged in a standoff with us between Baigaijiao and Zhutoushan. The two armies fought into the night, and the sound of gunfire never ceased.</p>
<p>× Reinforcements Invade Jiangmen Again</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the 30th, taking advantage of the heavy fog, × sent out several armored steamboats, rushing to Gubu, carrying 500 to 600 × soldiers and ammunition. Small wooden boats attached to the steamboats landed from Beijiao and Haideng, adding to the forces, and advanced in four ways. Around 11:00 AM, × sent more than a dozen planes to bomb Jiangmen, dropping dozens of bombs, including incendiary bombs, while covering the infantry's advance. Our troops held their ground and refused to retreat. Li Wuzi, Zhou Hanling, and Zhu Keqin personally commanded from the front lines, fighting fiercely with the × until 1:45 PM. The × focused their flat-trajectory fire on the front of the East Battery, causing heavy casualties to our troops. The × also suffered considerable casualties. For strategic reasons, our army retreated again, and Jiangmen city was recaptured. However, our troops continued to engage in mixed battles with the × in the areas outside the city, such as Fanluogang, Yuangang, and Zini Township. The people were determined not to give up until the × were driven out. The battle was fierce, making it one of the most heroic pages in the South China war. At the same time, because × had to divert forces to deal with Jiangmen and the Zhongshan area, the overall situation was slightly eased, it is said.</p>
<h3>The × Forces in Panyu Cannot Advance; Our Troops Become Increasingly Active; Our Troops Attack Lianhua Rock, × and Puppet Maintainers Disintegrate</h3>
<p>[Panyu Express News] The × army occupying Panyu has exhausted all means to try to restore order, but so far it has not been restored, while our troops are becoming increasingly active. Yesterday, on the 23rd, one of our units attacked the × at Lianhua Mountain, and carried away all the stored food and weapons. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Puppet Maintenance Associations Disintegrate One After Another</p>
<p>To promote puppet government and eliminate the will of our people to resist, the × chieftain in Panyu has recently implemented the insidious plan of "using Chinese to control Chinese," inciting the puppet magistrate of the county, Mr. Li, to force all villages to establish local maintenance associations within a time limit, collect military pay, and force the people to obtain "good citizen certificates" to prevent the activities of our guerrilla troops. If guerrilla activity is discovered in an area, the maintenance association in that area will be held responsible. As a result, personnel of the original puppet organizations are fleeing one after another, and the various puppet organizations are disintegrating. Currently, only Xinzao, Shiqiao, Dalong, Chishan, and other villages have established maintenance associations, but none of the associations have anyone in charge, so order in the villages cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>Second District Incorporates Panyu Bandits</p>
<p>Commander Wu Guanhong of the Second District Guerrilla Column believes that bandits have been rampant in the villages south of Panyu recently. After analyzing the reasons, he concluded that it was caused by the environment, and that they should be quickly incorporated to enhance our guerrilla resistance forces. He specially appointed Deputy Commander and County Magistrate Li Shuzong to lead the Guerrilla XX and other teams to the area south of Panyu to carry out the incorporation and to protect the spring plowing of farmers in the sandy fields in the villages to maintain the people's food supply. It is reported that Mr. Li has arrived at a certain place and is preparing to lead his troops to the destination area to be responsible for maintaining order, incorporating bandits, and protecting spring plowing.</p>
<p>× Food and Weapons at Lianhua Rock Seized</p>
<p>Furthermore, Panyu's Lianhua Rock is located on the west bank of Humen Neiyang. The southern part of the mountain has a stone cave that is quite deep and wide. Since the × bandits occupied Panyu, they used the nearby Yanghai area to store food and weapons in the cave to supply the × soldiers stationed in Shilou, Daling, Mingjing and other villages. Recently, our troops lurking in Lingtang Village in the northern part of the mountain learned of this and sent dozens of capable team members disguised as farmers under the pretense of working to launch an attack on the 23rd of this month. It happened to be the market day in Shilou Village, and all the × soldiers guarding the cave had gone to patrol the market, leaving only a dozen × soldiers to guard it. Our troops, seeing that the opportunity had come, first surrounded the cave and then sent another group to rush into it. There were more than a dozen × soldiers guarding the cave at the time. Our troops took them by surprise and bombarded them with hand grenades. At the sound of the explosions, more than a dozen × soldiers fell to the ground and died. Our troops then calmly moved all the food and weapons in the cave. Around 4:00 PM, the × soldiers finished patrolling the market and discovered what had happened, but all the food and weapons had been taken away, resulting in considerable losses, it is said.</p>
<h3>Our Planes Display Power in Continuous Strikes; Bombing Guangzhou × Positions; Destroying Baiyun and Tianhe Airports</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou Correspondence] Since our new air force was ordered to assist the various counter-offensive units of the Fourth War Area in annihilating the ×, it has repeatedly annihilated stubborn ×. From the 8th to the 27th of this month, our planes went to Guangzhou every day to bomb × positions. The 24th and 25th were particularly effective. On the 24th, as soon as it dawned, a fleet of ten of our planes flew to the suburbs of the city to conduct reconnaissance. At that time, the Guangzhou × army, caught off guard by the sudden arrival of our planes, did not have time to sound the alarm and fired frantically with anti-aircraft guns. However, our brave eagles soared freely, selected their targets, and continuously dropped more than 20 heavy bombs on the Baiyun and Tianhe airports in the suburbs. Soon, × planes rushed from overseas to intercept our planes, but our planes had safely returned to base. As a result of this bombing, in addition to the destruction of the Tianhe and Baiyun airports, six or seven × planes were also destroyed.</p>
<h3>The Rapacious × Planes at Seven Star Rock</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Correspondence] Zhaoqing's Seven Star Rock, north of the city, has towering mountains and rocks and deep caves, making it ideal for citizens to take refuge. The Guanyin Rock cave in particular is very large, large enough to accommodate more than 2,300 people. The Zhaoqing authorities had long ago equipped it as a shelter for citizens to prevent × plane attacks. Whenever an alarm sounded, the residents of Zhaoqing City and the surrounding areas rushed into the caves. Unexpectedly, on the 26th and 27th of March, × planes flew continuously over Zhaoqing, indiscriminately dropping more than a dozen bombs on Seven Star Rock. The loud explosions shook the mountains and valleys, blasting more than a dozen large stones from the top of Guanyin Rock, which fell down next to the entrance of the cave. Each stone weighed more than a thousand catties, which shows the power of the explosions. However, thousands of civilians taking refuge inside the cave suffered no losses. Although the × frantically bombed our civilians, the result was merely a waste of ammunition.</p>
<h3>× Cruelty to Traitorous Troops in Xicun; Taiwanese and Koreans Rebel Against the War; × Kills Another Captain in Xiajiao</h3>
<p>[Nanhai Express News] The Taiwanese and Korean × soldiers in Shi... Tao Shi... , because of harsh × treatment and unpaid salaries, mutinied, stabbing the × regimental commander and the × second lieutenant in charge of salaries. More than 80 people were arrested by the × military police, and the ringleaders were executed. Details have been reported in the newspapers. Recently, it was learned that the Taiwanese and Korean × soldiers in Leigang, Xiajiao, Yanbu, Shiwan, Lanshi and other places were dissatisfied with the × chieftain's handling of the Shiwan incident, extremely angry, and secretly plotting to rebel against the war. The atmosphere is extremely tense. On the 24th of this month, more than a dozen soldiers of Dong nationality stationed in... × army, had an argument with the × 12th Regimental Commander Kawaki Harano for failing to receive their salaries, which turned into violence. Kawaki Harano was outnumbered and was stabbed in the abdomen with a spear by a Shandong soldier, and died from his serious wounds. The dozen or so Shandong soldiers knew that they had caused a death and could not escape, so they disguised themselves and fled to surrender to our guerrilla forces. The Foshan × chieftain is extremely anxious about the anti-war incident of the ten platoons of soldiers, but there is no way to stop it, it is said.</p>
<p>China Travel Service Q&amp;A Column</p>
<h3>To Chongqing Answer to Mr. Xu Shaowen</h3>
<p>Question: Regarding traveling to Chongqing via Haiphong: 1. What are the procedures for obtaining a passport in Hong Kong? How much does it cost? Can your company obtain it on my behalf? Can a photo of six or seven people be taken together?</p>
<p>2. What is the lowest ship fare from Hong Kong to Haiphong?</p>
<p>3. I heard that there are many difficulties when landing in Haiphong, such as baggage inspection, item declaration, and various other problems. Is this true?</p>
<p>4. Regarding Vietnamese epidemic prevention regulations, is it necessary to have an official doctor's certificate proving that you have been vaccinated or inoculated with cowpox in order to land? Can you land if you have been vaccinated but do not have a doctor's certificate?</p>
<p>5. I heard that a head tax is required when landing. I don't know how much it is or if there is an age limit. Do transit passengers also have to pay?</p>
<p>6. How much is the train fare from Haiphong to Kunming? What are the conditions for food and lodging along the way? How much is the train fare from Kunming to Chongqing?</p>
<p>7. Regarding the route via Shantou and Shaoguan to Chongqing, which province and highway is the fastest? How much is the fare? Is the cost cheaper than going via Haiphong?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>(1) A transit visa can be obtained from the Consular Affairs Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong. Attach two personal photos. If it is a family, they can be taken in one photo. Servants should have a separate photo. The visa fee is 8 Hong Kong dollars, and the French consulate visa fee is 1 Hong Kong dollar.</p>

<p>(3) There are no such problems when landing in Haiphong.</p>
<p>(4) If you have a doctor's certificate for epidemic prevention and vaccination, there are no difficulties.</p>
<p>(5) The so-called head tax is probably a misunderstanding of the landing tax, which has already been collected with the purchase of the ticket.</p>
<p>(6) The lowest train fare from Haiphong to Kunming is 14.6 Vietnamese dollars. Food and lodging along the way will cost about ten dollars. The car fare from Kunming to Chongqing is 29.5 national currency. (7) The cost of this route is unknown.</p>
<h3>Maritime Special News</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, dense fog has frequently shrouded the ports, so the ships arriving in Hong Kong recently have often been delayed. Unexpectedly, this morning, the port authorities received news that the Guangzhou (CANTON) of the Yihang Shipping Company was coming to Hong Kong from Shanghai. When sailing to the sea 110 miles outside the port, it encountered fog and lost its way. Captain Jacques deliberately reduced speed to a minimum. Unexpectedly, when sailing to 22.41 degrees north latitude and 116.18 degrees east longitude, it suddenly collided with the French mail ship Marshal Joffre (MARECHALJOFFRE). Fortunately, both ships were sailing slowly at the time, so there was no major damage. For safety reasons, the French mail ship immediately turned around and returned to one port for inspection. After the Guangzhou ship arrives in Hong Kong, it must be docked for repairs before it can continue sailing. It is said that the two ships were blocked by thick smoke and were only able to enter the port this morning.</p>
<h3>Daliang After the Fall</h3>
<p>— Shao Min</p>
<p>In order to report on the news from the occupied areas and investigate the situation of our compatriots, I decided to run to Daliang, Shunde, which had not been occupied for long.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 26th of this month, I hurriedly prepared my disguise and carefully checked my belongings, always adhering to the principle of not letting the × people recognize me as a reporter. I felt a little different, but my steps when I set off were particularly relaxed. In order to avoid the suspicion of the × people, I chartered a small lotus-picking boat from Bailian City. The boat then carried me, an old bumpkin, across Shatou, and I braced myself and steered towards the shore. "Halt!" A × soldier came over to interrogate me. Fortunately, the old bumpkin pretended to be respectful and sneaked through the first gate.</p>
<p>Walking along the Zhongshun Highway, I marched forward. Except for me and three or five listless × sentries, I couldn't find a single other person on the highway. After walking for an hour, I finally arrived in Daliang city. Because I didn't have a good citizen certificate, I went through a lot of difficulties and insults. However, the compatriots in the occupied areas that I saw in Daliang suffered even more severe insults than I did. This is not self-consolation, but a message to all compatriots across the country.</p>
<p>Jiangben, Harada, and Fukuda, these three × troops, occupy different sections, which are the areas where × people collect taxes on smoking and gambling. Jiangben's troops occupy Liao Xinshi's residence near the public ... Harada's troops occupy the Shatou ... factory, and Fukuda's troops occupy the county government. The puppet association chairman is Liang Tianlu, and the vice-chairmen are Su XX and Chen XX. The puppet self-defense corps is still composed of those traitorous puppet police corps members who led the ×, renamed the Daliang Self-Defense Corps.</p>
<p>In reality, Daliang has truly become a dead city since it was occupied. All the shops are closed and have stopped buying and selling. Nine out of ten households have been emptied. The only remaining shops are food shops that are forced to operate, and naturally occurring opium dens and gambling houses. Apart from × soldiers and undesirable elements - opium addicts - gamblers, perhaps less than one-tenth of the people are law-abiding citizens.</p>
<p>In the early morning of the 27th, a noisy crowd created a commotion. At the time, I thought the × soldiers had caused some trouble. Later, after some investigation, I learned that the × soldiers were setting off to attack Rongqi and Guizhou. Hearing this news, I tried several times to escape back to Rongqi to provide our troops with detailed intelligence, but the dense fog blocked all routes. Moreover, the × people's attack on Ronggui was launched in five ways, from Bailian City, Da'ao, Mentou, Gang, and Nansha, so none of the routes were passable and I could not complete my mission. This is a most regrettable thing.</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, I heard in Daliang that our troops had retreated to Ronggui, but were still engaged in mixed battles with the ×, waiting for reinforcements to arrive, and would immediately launch a counter-offensive against the ×. At this time, I thought my mission had come to an end. No matter how difficult, I had to leave this occupied area in a short period of time and continue my anti-Japanese propaganda work. So I turned around behind Majiang, along the mulberry fish ponds, transferred from Nansha to Dongximaning, and after a whole day and night of nonstop walking, I arrived at Xiaolan, our military defense area.</p>
<p>Because the reporter's mission this time, in addition to conducting an on-the-spot survey of the news in Daliang, also included conducting an investigation for the cadres of the First District Separate Action Corps, there is less news reporting and more intelligence reporting, in order to directly help the war of resistance. Now the reporter has decided to throw away the pen and take up the gun to fight the × people. Arise, those who do not want to be slaves!</p>
<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<h3>The World's Highest-Paid Female Star: Gracie Fields</h3>
<p>Who is the highest-paid actress in Hollywood? Is it Norma Shearer? Is it Garbo? Or is it even Deanna Durbin or Shirley Temple?... Not at all. It is someone who is well-known in Britain but still a new name in America - Gracie Fields.</p>
<p>"At that time, we were dirt poor, penniless, poorer than a church mouse - maybe even worse - so at the age of six, I had the idea of going out to earn a few pennies to help the family. I decided to sing on the street in the highest note of my six-year-old voice, thinking that passersby would be moved by my singing and throw a few pennies into my hat. But it wasn't quite like that. I seemed to have a little too much confidence in my own musical talent. People who heard me sing just looked at me contemptuously. Disheartened, I went home."</p>
<p>These are the words of Gracie Fields, who is now the highest-paid actress in the world. For seventeen years, she has held the highest star position in the British Empire, and also has a large number of audiences in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Norway, and Sweden.</p>
<p>She, a poor girl from a small mill town, was also honored by the British King and Queen to perform for them many times on the radio or on stage.</p>
<p>Because she came from a poor background, even though she is now famous and rich, she is still honest and open, and never feels ashamed of her past poverty. She is a performer with a good character.</p>
<p>"My mother was a washerwoman at the theater in Lancashire," she confessed candidly at a luncheon after signing a contract with 20th Century Fox - a contract stipulating that she could alternate filming in both Britain and the United States - "I often went with her when she brought the washed clothes. Gradually, I learned a few tunes backstage and practiced them at home, singing at the top of my lungs, disturbing the whole family. At the age of eight, I actually did pretty well and became a little singer in a movie theater. A month later, I quit this job and joined a children's performance group. The pay? Incredibly meager - one shilling a week."</p>
<p>"When I was fifteen, I went to join a musical revue, but unfortunately, the manager only glanced at me and deemed me unqualified. My heart was broken, thinking that I had lost the greatest opportunity to perform on stage. At this time, the family's financial situation actually improved slightly. My father wrote to me, saying that he didn't want me to be on stage and hoped that I could return to the Stanseville spinning mill to work. He also said that it couldn't be called a profession, but it was at least better than me trying to be a performer and starving to death. I agreed with great joy, because I hadn't eaten three meals at that point."</p>
<p>"When I got there, it was indeed as my father said, this job couldn't be considered a profession. The working hours were long and the pay was low. I still hadn't given up my desire to perform and sing, and I often sang loudly during work hours. When I sang, the other workers put down their work to listen quietly. They liked to hear me sing, and I was very happy, but the factory was greatly affected by me, and the work was delayed. So before long, the factory stopped my pay. In other words, I was fired again."</p>
<p>At this point, Hares Pyle brought his little daughter over to take a photo with her, interrupting her story. Hares said many admiring things to her, calling her the world's greatest comedian. After Hares left, 20th Century Fox star Virginia Fields came over and greeted her, and they talked very warmly for a while.</p>
<p>"My first real stage profession," he said, after Virginia left, "was in 1914, playing Princess Morocco in a pantomime, 'Dick Whittington.' Later, I got a good role in 'Mr. Bohrer of London.' The script was excellent and was later introduced to London and became a well-known play."</p>
<p>Gracie is very humble and does not attribute this success to herself, but we can see that this time she was successful not only in London, but also everywhere, and since then, she has become one of the most famous actresses in the British Empire, to this day.</p>
<p>After her career was successful, she married Archie Pitts, a renowned producer. Under his training and guidance, she further reached the pinnacle of her career.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," she said, "I perform six shows a day, three at one place and three at another. It's a little busy, but it's very interesting, and because so many people want to see me, I always try to greet them backstage."</p>
<p>Even now, she is still the same.</p>
<p>The name Gracie Fields is often mentioned in the same breath as Charlie Chaplin. This is for good reason. Just like Chaplin, she makes people feel a touch of bitterness and tears amid the laughter. Half of her plays are pantomime and half are talking, and her artistic achievements are widespread throughout the world. People all over the world can understand and appreciate her work. In Belgium, in France, in Germany, she does not change her movements or her English, yet everyone can understand."</p>
<p>"My first time in the United States was ten years ago, performing in a theater in New York. Someone advised me that I should change the tone of my singing to cater to American audiences. I listened to him for the first three days. On the fourth day, I went back to my old singing style. But the audience welcomed it very much. Good humor, as long as it is not too silly or satirical, will have an audience in any country, no matter what language they speak."</p>
<p>She does not broadcast often. The government limits the number of times she broadcasts, one reason being that after she did a broadcast a few years ago, theater owners and managers were terrified and complained that as long as she broadcast, everyone would stay home to listen to the radio. It is estimated that the number of people who listened to her voice was about 400,000. This greatly affected the business of the theaters, so later her broadcasts were restricted to only twice a year.</p>
<p>In 1931, she entered the film industry and became Britain's most popular and highest-paid actress.</p>
<p>How high is her salary? It is difficult to estimate. We only know that the net profit from her gramophone records is about 5 million pounds. She receives about 550 letters every week, all asking her to host charity bazaars, or to be a judge in beauty contests, and other things. In a recent election, 200 politicians asked her to endorse them, but she refused them all. She even has a steamship named after her. Her "fan club" includes hundreds of people, all loyal supporters of her.</p>
<p>She is very willing to stay in California for a long time, but she cannot. If she really stayed in the United States, it would be like Shirley Temple leaving the United States and living in England. The British would painfully lose their most popular and great artist of the generation.</p>

<h3>Today's First Division Football League: Oriental Club to Battle the American Military, at 5 PM at So Kon Po Field, Shanghai Stars Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to Participate</h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Since entering the second round of the league, the Oriental Club's first division football team has been on a roll, with continuous point increases. As of now, they are firmly in third place, and their hopes for the runner-up position have not been extinguished. Therefore, today's match against the US Navy team is a crucial one. If they can defeat the US team in this final push, they will have 29 points and can then observe the outcome of the future match between South China South and the Navy team to their advantage. Although this is an opportunity dependent on others, and it is uncertain whether they can achieve their wish, considering the hope and reputation at stake, since there is an opportunity, they should do their best. After all, the runner-up position is also an honor, and it is not easy to obtain.</p>
<p>As the Oriental Club is about to embark on a southern tour, they have invited Shanghai stars Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to Hong Kong to join them. Today, with this opportunity, they can display their skills at So Kon Po Field, which is truly a blessing for the Oriental Club, and the fans will also be treated to a visual feast. Here is a brief introduction to the resumes of Xu and Cao. Mr. Xu is a versatile athlete of the present day, an exceptional talent. He has above-average skills in tennis and basketball, and even more insight into football. Since the Eastern China team, he has held the position of center forward or right inside forward in famous teams such as Ping Han, Bei Ning, and Sichuan, and is known for his skillful dribbling and shooting. At the end of last year, he left Sichuan and passed through [unclear word]. The Oriental Club intended to invite him to serve, and he was eager to try. However, the Shanghai Lido team urged him to return north, and the talk of his appearance in Hong Kong did not materialize. He has returned today and finally made it a reality, which is due to fate in football.</p>
<p>Mr. Cao is one of the top left-wing players in the country. His dribbling, passing, and shooting are clean and beautiful. When he was in Bei Ning, he had a good partnership with Jiang Lu, and they were known as the "front-line double excellence." At that time, Jiang played left wing, and he played inside forward. Today, he is serving the Oriental Club, and he may still fill that position, naturally being familiar with the job. If Hou Chengtiao is absent, he will play left wing instead. His nickname is "Little Sanzi." He has broken his leg twice while playing football. Recently, the Shanghai Lido team won the Skoto Cup and the Junior Championship, thanks in large part to Cao.</p>
<p>Today, with these two fierce generals on the field, the Oriental Club is as powerful as a tiger with wings and is confident of victory. Moreover, this match is a one-sided affair. The Oriental Club considers it important, while the US team considers it ordinary. Because the US team's position is lagging behind and they have no chance to compete, and since Watson and Corogan returned to England, their strength is not as good as before. Although there are replacements and the military appearance is still strong, because the gains and losses are not important, they are simply playing according to the rules. It is unlikely that the soldiers have fighting spirit, so the Oriental Club's victory is indeed possible.</p>
<p>The technical condition of the Oriental Club's players is improving day by day, which is visible to all. Today, they have also transferred Xu Jincheng to the center back position to strengthen the attacking power of the front line. The arrangement is organized and it is truly pleasing to my heart. If Liu Shizhan can restrain Strauss's progress at the time, Jincheng can intercept Pearson's rush, and Luo Weiquan can keep a close eye on Curney so that he cannot move, then the most troublesome figure in the US team's front line will have no room to play. However, the US team's forward line is very strong, so Xu and Cao, the two new generals, should plan in advance to avoid the solid and take advantage of the weak in order to be effective. Cooperation is especially important.</p>
<p>The weather has been clear recently, and the field is dry. The Oriental Club's front line is good at blitzing and should take advantage of this opportunity. Moreover, all the forwards are known for their agility, and their progress will undoubtedly be rapid. The only concern is that Xu and Cao are participating in the war for the first time and may not have a tacit understanding of cooperation. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Oriental Club)</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Miao Huaguo Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan Xu Jincheng Liu Shizhan</p>
<p>Hou Chengtiao Cao Qiuting Xu Wenkui Li Deqi Wu Qixiang Chen Bingshi</p>

<h3>South China's Charity Match in Vietnam Raises Over 7,000 National Currency Units to Be Remitted to the National Government for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>(Special Report from Water News) Last month, when the South China Football Team went to Saigon, they accepted the invitation of local overseas Chinese groups to hold a charity match in South Vietnam to raise funds. This is what it means to save the country through sports.</p>
<p>The ticket sales for the charity match were very good. Yesterday, Mo Qing, the director of the South China Football Department, received a letter from the overseas Chinese groups that organized the charity match, stating that the total income from the charity match, calculated in national currency, was more than 7,000 yuan, which has been remitted to the Finance Department's office in Hong Kong and forwarded to the National Government for disaster relief to the compatriots in the homeland.

<h3>Pui Ying Middle School Today's Track and Field Meet Location: Caroline Hill</h3>
<p>Pui Ying Middle School is scheduled to hold its sports day at the South China Athletic Association grounds on Caroline Hill today, starting at 8:00 AM. The sports program is extremely rich. Ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life are welcome to visit the venue. The field will be temporarily closed for other uses during the war period.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong-Singapore Football Match Ticket Sales Brisk Field Will Be Temporarily Closed for Other Uses During the War</h3>
<p>The South China Athletic Association believes that the Singapore-China football team's expedition to Hong Kong is a rare event. The team is full of talented players, and the three matches are undoubtedly a combination of the elite of our country's football. The future candidates to represent our country in the World Games can also be determined from this battle. Therefore, in order to ensure order and focus during the event, so that the competition can proceed smoothly and perfectly, it is specifically decided that during the three-day period of the Star China team's competition on April 1, 2, and 5, all the basketball, volleyball, and tennis courts and venues of the South China Athletic Association on Caroline Hill will be temporarily closed to members. A circular has been sent to the heads of all departments to investigate and handle this matter. It is also reported that the Hong Kong-Singapore Star Game admission tickets that have been pre-sold at the South China Billiard Room and the Qianghua Company in the Chinese Building have been selling like hotcakes, with crowds gathering to purchase them. The one-dollar tickets are about to be sold out. Fans who want to get good seats should buy them as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>Zhu Jianqiu and Daguan were at their peak, but at this time, Finster showed signs of fatigue and found it difficult to cope. Lin took advantage of his weakness and completed the victory in one go. This set was a 10-6 game.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Tennis Match Lin Tiande's Skills Were Extraordinary Fought Hard and Defeated Finster 2-0 Three More Singles Matches Today</h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) The Open Grass Tennis Doubles and Singles Tournament has been underway for a month. In the process of weeding out the weak and retaining the strong, it has entered a tense stage. However, the intensity of the competition did not exceed yesterday's singles match between Lin Tiande and Finster. The two sides held each other for 32 games before resolving the victory or defeat. The tension of the situation and the closeness of the score can be imagined.</p>
<p>Lin is from Meixian, Guangdong, and grew up in Perak. He is 20 years old. He started playing tennis when he was over ten years old. Because he is talented, his skills have improved day by day. Before coming to Hong Kong to study at the University of Hong Kong this year, he won the Perak doubles and singles championships.</p>
<p>Finster was the singles leader in Hong Kong many years ago. Now, due to his age, his skills are slightly inferior, but his experience is rich, and he is still a veteran singles player in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday's match was between a young general and an old master. Under the circumstances, there was bound to be a fierce battle, so there were many spectators and it was lively.</p>
<p>As far as the reporter saw, Lin's flat hand shots were accurate and powerful. His serve, which combined both soft and hard, was also ingenious. His victory yesterday was due to the above two advantages, and his youth and strength also gave him a considerable advantage. However, his backhand shot often lacked accuracy, sometimes good and sometimes bad. Therefore, his hard-fought victory was purely due to the fact that his backhand shot rarely yielded benefits. If this technique were also good, it would have been easier to win. Also, his style is only accustomed to using left and right baseline shots and rarely goes to the net. This may be due to Finster's sufficient experience, which made him afraid to try. It was also seen that his positioning often had errors, but fortunately, his movements were quick and he was able to make up for them. In short, Lin is a promising talent who will surely become famous in the future, but his experience is still new.</p>
<p>Finster's shots still had speed, and his mid-court chop shots were even more sophisticated. However, he was overweight and weak, and when he ran too much, he was most afraid of the ball's approach close to his body. Therefore, he often lost points due to the above two weaknesses, not due to a lack of skill or experience.</p>
<p>After the start of the match, Finster took the first two games, and Lin also retaliated. In this way, they held each other until 5-5 and 6-6, fighting hard and evenly matched. In the middle of the match, the two often had good plays, winning applause from the audience. Later, Lin made extra efforts, often attacking the opponent's weaknesses, and serving well, and then won the next two games, winning the first set 8-6. The score of the first set is as follows:</p>
<p>First Set</p>
<p>Lin Tiande 1 3 4 4 5 6 4 5</p>
<p>Finster 4 5 1 2 7 4 1 3</p>
<p>1 1 2 6 4 4 8 games</p>
<p>4 4 4 4 1 2 Games</p>
<p>Lin took advantage of the victory in the first set and won the next two games in a row at the beginning of the second set, making it easier to win. However, Finster had experience and was able to seize opportunities to counterattack, despite a lack of strength. Therefore, when the score reached 4-4, the situation was most tense and suspenseful. Looking at the scores of 10-8 and 8-10 at that time, the state of stalemate can be seen. Then 5-5, 6-6, 8-8, three times tied, if plum blossom</p>
<p>Second Set</p>
<p>Lin Tiande 4 4 1 4 8 3 2</p>
<p>Finster 1 1 4 1 8 5 4</p>
<p>1 3 2 4 7 4 0 2 4 4 4 10 games</p>
<p>1 1 4 6 5 2 4 4 1 1 0 8 games</p>
<p>The match between Naxi and Zhenxiang was also worth watching. In terms of technique, Lu was superior to Naxi, but Lu's physique was too weak, and in the last set, when the score reached 5-5, his right hand cramped, so he lost 5-7, which was a pity. In the match between last year's champion Xu Weipei and Huang Zhaorong, Xu calmly responded and won 6-3, 6-2 without feeling threatened. The doubles team of Xian Bing Shi gave up, and Luo Ding Xian Li Qi won without fighting. The results are recorded as follows: (Dongchu)</p>

<p>Children's Individual Champion Xu Jianren, 20 points,</p>
<h3>On School Sports in Hong Kong (2)</h3>
<p>— —Excellence—</p>
<p>The status of sports and the instructors of sports should emphasize universal sports. All students and staff in the entire school should be able to have a strong physique and a sound mind. This is the school's greatest and most precious trophy. I would not dare to say that Hong Kong schools do not have a relatively organized approach to sports and do not value sports. However, only a minority of them do so and cannot reach the majority, let alone be universal.</p>
<p>(2) Each School's Approach to</p>
<p>Sports Instruction</p>
<p>Because most schools in Hong Kong despise sports, the past sports instructors in schools have mostly been athletes or people who have graduated from ordinary schools and have a slight interest in sports. I would not dare to say that among these people, there are no outstanding individuals who can painstakingly study and achieve good results. However, they are not as good as those who graduated from the sports department of other universities or vocational schools, because sports departments or vocational schools are generally more substantial. Whether it is knowledge or technology, they will have deeper research. The reason why school sports in Hong Kong has not been able to develop universally in the past is also largely due to these sports instructors who do not come from proper backgrounds. It is hoped that in the future, school officials, if they truly establish schools for education and educate for the health of the nation, should pay attention to sports training and the appointment of sports instructors, and should respect their academic qualifications, experience, character cultivation, and spirit.</p>
<p>(3) Sports Field</p>
<p>Because of the terrain and environment of Hong Kong schools, the construction of sports fields has become a major problem. Many schools do not even have sports facilities, which has led many schools to use this as an excuse to despise or abandon the sports subject. In fact, we must not neglect the training of students' physiques due to the problem of facilities, and foster a general weakness among scholars and girls who cannot bear the weight of their clothes. We should strive to break through all adverse environments and difficult and arduous matters, and use our ingenious and lively minds to deal with everything, just to achieve the purpose of our sports training. We should have the courage to work hard. In this difficult environment, of course, we cannot build track and field fields or standard football, basketball, and volleyball courts, but we can always make facilities according to the environment and promote various sports that do not require wide spaces, such as lively calisthenics, etc. Even when these kinds of venues are not available, we can use the rooftop or balcony. Taking a step back, we can also do games and calisthenics in the classroom, or temporarily move the chairs to a corner and then carry out mat exercises, etc. It all depends on whether we are willing to shoulder the heavy burden of national physical training. If we can have this kind of determination, of course, we can overcome any difficulties, and the venue will not be our problem.</p>
<p>(4) Should Promote Lively Gymnastics</p>
<p>The reason why school sports in the past did not develop was largely due to the problem of venues, but other aspects were also due to the fact that previous sports instructors could not make facilities according to the environment. All they saw were ball games or track and field sports, and they did not pay attention to the sports that are most suitable for promotion in the Hong Kong school environment. The value of this kind of sports training not only includes the effectiveness of ball games and track and field, but is even more superior, which is lively gymnastics. Regarding this kind of equipment, it does not require wide spaces and is extremely cheap and durable in terms of cost. Therefore, this is a very good path for the popularization of school sports in Hong Kong. If each school can advance along this path, of course, it will be easy to implement and achieve the goal of "popularizing sports." Comrades, let's promote it together! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Comedy of Fleeing from the Besieged Madrid (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Guzinan Translated by Zhuang Zhong</p>
<p>—We can't abandon the front line here and all run over there. Two thousand people are enough, and the rest can stay here... No one wants to stay there. It took a lot of talking to convince them. As a result, two thousand young people, with red and black scarves around their necks, shouting revolutionary slogans, and filled with fighting spirit, immediately set off for the defense of Madrid to face death and glory...</p>
<p>In Dalan there are hundreds of fighters who survived the Battle of Siguenza, and in addition, about the same number of Madrid workers and farmers joined their ranks. On November 6, they received an order saying:</p>
<p>—Don't let anyone pass with weapons—Madrid needs all the military!</p>
<p>A large convoy of cars set off from Madrid, carrying a bunch of cowards fleeing for their lives. In the Langon area, the militiamen with guns in their hands stopped the progress of those large cars:</p>
<p>—Where are you going?</p>
<p>—To Molins de Rei.</p>
<p>—Why?</p>
<p>—Special mission.</p>
<p>Indeed, in times of special missions, all mentally unsound people are looking for a special mission. But the militiamen didn't let it go like that.</p>
<p>—You are all cowardly things—go back to Madrid!</p>
<p>Some, feeling ashamed, turned back. Others tried to get through:</p>
<p>—Okay, then put down your weapons in Molins de Rei.</p>
<p>These are not needed, it's useless.</p>
<p>A car brought Pedro Rico (Mayor of Madrid - Translator). They fired a shot at the front of the car, turning Rico's face completely deathly pale. He was so frightened that he didn't know what to do. Seeing his embarrassed state, the militiamen laughed loudly:</p>
<p>A militiaman rebuked him. —Want to run away too? Coward.</p>
<p>Pedro Rico tried hard to defend himself, but another interrupted him, saying</p>
<p>—Do we have to smash your face against the wall!</p>
<p>He fled in panic, turning back towards Madrid amidst laughter and ridicule. As soon as he arrived in Madrid, he sought refuge in a foreign embassy... It was already dusk when the team was inspected by José Villalba, a gaunt, bold, and decisive figure. He had shown his bravery in seizing the Montaña Barracks and in the battles of Guadalajara and Siguenza. When Madrid was threatened, he led his men to defend the city. He achieved victories on the Casa de Campo battlefield and later died fighting foreign bandits in the Teruel area.</p>
<p>A convoy of cars arrived, and the militiamen detained them. A voice shouted:</p>
<p>—Let them go—there are many ministers in the cars!</p>
<p>All the passengers in the cars were called down. One of them said to Villalba:</p>
<p>—This is really outrageous! I am from such and such ministry, I am going to Molins de Rei...</p>
<p>Villalba replied: —Given the responsibilities of ministers like you, you should be staying with the people in this time of crisis. Now you are running away, you will demoralize the combatants...</p>
<p>Three or four more appeared, all of them ministers. Villalba disarmed them and put them in a room. One minister couldn't help but ask in a panic:</p>
<p>—What are you going to do?</p>
<p>—I feel like doing this—replied Villalba—Tomorrow, when we go to the front line, we will take you to the front...</p>
<p>—This is a barbaric act...</p>
<p>—Most likely, we will execute you, as you deserve...</p>
<p>He immediately called Mier (Mier is the head of the CNT, who is actually responsible for the defense of Madrid) and said:</p>
<p>—I have four ministers who fled from Madrid here. What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>Mier's mind was not confused. He knew that in this extremely serious situation, everyone's life was hanging by a thread. The government's relocation could only be interpreted as an evasion of responsibility. He was against the relocation. But what was the use of detaining those ministers, so he ordered:</p>
<p>—Let them go!</p>
<p>—But this is...</p>
<p>—Nothing, nothing! Do as I tell you!</p>
<p>—Okay, but I want to be relieved of my responsibility. Write me an order... Mier gave him the order he wanted. When he received it, he read it slowly, and then he said to the ministers: —The organization (CNT) opposes our views. I am now setting you free. You can go to Molins de Rei. But don't forget how you ran away today, and don't forget the bravery of the Madrid people in the battle...</p>
<p>The ministers climbed into the car in anger and drove forward at full speed. It was already dawn. Villalba watched them drive away on the road. Then he shouted loudly</p>
<p>—Now, we are going to fulfill our responsibility to save Madrid</p>
<p>People began to climb into those large military vehicles, heading in the opposite direction to the ministers. They were heading towards death, but also towards the life of freedom and victory... (The End)</p>
<h3>My Own Writing</h3>
<p>— Chen Xianwen</p>
<p>Wanting to talk about literature and its sensibility, I inevitably thought of the phrase "my own writing" again. "My own writing" loses its seriousness because it is often paired with the phrase "another man's wife," and the part of the truth it contains is thus ignored. In fact, while we cannot affirm its absolute truth, its relative truth cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Authors have always used their works to depict reason, infect emotions, and reflect reality. From the classical school to the realist school, a series of them have been proving the correctness of this interpretation. The progress of literature, like the progress of history, is increasing in complexity. Therefore, modern literature not only accommodates the established interpretations as much as possible, but also often uses a critical eye on reality. That is, the author expresses his feelings (subjective and objective) based on his rich experience of reality in the most appropriate way.</p>
<p>The more excellent and flawless a work is, the more it can fulfill its mission in tiny paragraphs or plain situations. As a reader or critic, how should he understand and explore the author's true understanding and expression of nature, history, and human thought in the work? If they lack the same experience and understanding of reality as the author, that is to say, they lack the experience and understanding of the same reality, or they assess the value of that work in a careless manner, what will be the result? Undoubtedly, they will fall into great errors.</p>
<p>Therefore, while it is important for an author to have a correct experience and understanding of reality and a thorough method of expression, it is equally important for a reader or critic to have the experience and understanding of the reality expressed in the work when assessing the value of a work.</p>
<p>Therefore, the phrase "my own writing" cannot establish absolute truth because the author may not correctly express reality with a critical eye, and its relative truth is because the author sometimes understands the phenomenon expressed more realistically than others.</p>
<h3>Speaking up for Scientists</h3>
<p>— Shui Chang</p>
<p>Ever since the World War, we have often heard the public criticize that scientists are creating sins by inventing all kinds of lethal weapons for the use of ambitious people, resulting in a situation where "one general succeeds upon ten thousand bones." In recent years, seeing so many people in East Asia and West Asia suffer great sacrifices, killed by airplanes, cannons, bombs, machine guns. This wave of blaming scientists is getting louder and louder. But these are all temporary emotional reactions that have confused reason. Many people believe that scientists should be responsible for inventing something new; whenever they encounter knowledge and methods that have the potential to kill, they must take precautions in advance; or not conduct the work before the invention; or keep it strictly confidential after the invention, absolutely not for people to use. According to this, our ancient sage Suirenshi committed many sins when he invented drilling wood to make fire. He should have foreseen that later people would use fire to kill, and that there would be fire attack methods in later tactics, so he wouldn't have drilled any wood.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor created the chariot, initially using oxen to pull it, and later using horses. When two countries fought each other, chariots occupied a very important position. The ancients also said: The great use of the Rong people lies in horses, so Emperor Gaozu of Han had the bold statement of "gaining the world on horseback," which shows that chariots and horses were necessary for war before the twentieth century. Chariots should not have been invented in the first place, and horses should not have been trained. In ancient times, metal was cast into blades, and blades refer to knives, swords, spears, halberds, and arrows, which can be said to be murderous weapons. Gold is metal, first copper, then iron, and finally steel. These metals should not have been invented either.</p>
<p>In the Stone Age, humans used stones as weapons. When everyone learned to use them, in order to resist and survive, they invented the use of bows and arrows. Later, they felt that it was not powerful enough, so they invented firearms, such as rockets and fire guns. A further step is modern guns and cannons. Who can say that when defending against foreign insults, one should not devote one's heart and soul to think of all kinds of self-defense methods? If someone said, "We have umbrellas, so it rains," then he must be considered to have a mental illness. Then, aren't those who criticize material civilization in place of scientists committing the same mistake?</p>
<p>Those who criticize science still want to argue, definitely pointing to modern airplanes and cannons as the crystallization of science. May I ask, what is the difference between the convenience of creating airplanes for transportation and communication, and the Yellow Emperor creating chariots? What is the difference between inventing explosives to open mountains and mines and subdue fierce beasts, and Suirenshi making fire? Are the inventions in science more beneficial to mankind? Are they more harmful to mankind? Even if scientists are scapegoated and forced to confess to all kinds of trumped-up charges of murder and arson. I am afraid that offsetting the merits against the crimes, the merits are already greater than the crimes.</p>
<p>Weapons can never be forcibly divided into two types, one for self-defense and one for attacking others. Only talking about self-defense and not attacking others is passive resistance, but absolutely passive resistance is not the case. To do the work of resisting aggression, we must seek relatively effective methods and strength of counterattack in order to be confident. In short, science can never predict whether an invention will have improper applications, nor can it prevent an invention from being used for evil by those who do not talk about morality. And knowing that an invention may not be beneficial to mankind, due to the special relationship of the environment, one cannot but work hard to carry it out. Critics must abandon their subjective attitude in order to be fair.</p>

<h3>Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shuqun</p>
<p>Although she is a weakling, there are moments when a weakling completely controlled by fragile emotions takes the bravest actions. However, these actions lack the restraint of a strong person's reason, and are governed only by a kind of blind impulse – even a derangement of the nervous system. It is like the act and psychology of a weakling daring to commit suicide. The momentary psychology possessed by this action is abnormal; but the perverted wisdom, in the moment possessed by this action, is perhaps more clever than usual. It is like the ingenious methods discovered by the weak for suicide. She stopped waiting for him for a moment, let him walk parallel to her; she deliberately asked him softly:</p>
<p>"Are you too cold?"</p>
<p>"Don't you hate me anymore?"</p>
<p>"Of course, I don't hate you anymore! Are you too cold? I'll give you the scarf!"</p>
<p>"No!" He patted his chest to show her, and said, "I'm not afraid of the cold!" She didn't allow it. He had no choice but to reach out:</p>
<p>"Then give it to me!"</p>
<p>"No, I'll wrap it around you!"</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>Afraid of betraying her kindness, he stopped, leaned his head out from his collar, waiting for her to wrap the scarf around him. But, feeling a gust of wind, or perhaps an ice flow, enter his flesh; then, he realized that the sharp knife hidden under the scarf had suddenly pierced his neck, splitting it open, and blood was dripping down. At that time, he was fortunate to step back and grab her hand, otherwise, he might have been seriously injured. He never thought she would have such a brave experiment, let alone that the fierce tiger of the moment before would turn into a little lamb – she had collapsed in a daze, falling at his feet, the vengeful and bloodstained knife thrown beside her. After being startled and wounded, he couldn't help but feel some anger. However, comparing her two extremely different postures before and after that moment, she seemed like the possessor of two souls, making him feel amused and strange; so he endured his pain and helped her up from the ground. He brushed off the traces on her body, while smilingly calling her:</p>
<p>"Wake up, it's almost dawn!" Yes, she did indeed seem to have taken a nap; after waking up, she still had a heavy drowsiness.</p>
<p>"You won." She heard his voice, and cried, this cry, for him, was a kind of shame? Because he did not retaliate; for herself, it was a kind of self-reproach, because she had not been satisfied. (Twenty-three)</p>
