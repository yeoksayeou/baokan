<p>社評</p>
<h3>目前戰局及其前途</h3>
<p>這幾天抗日前綫的軍事形勢，又趨緊張嚴重。北方戰場雖無重大變化，而華中華南戰局，則已引起中外一致的注視，特別是南昌失陷以後，一般關心抗戰前途的，就不能不憂慮到長沙和粤漢全綫的命運，而且當此贛湘戰事吃緊之際，粤北粤南×軍又有蠢動傾向，粤北之英德一帶，巳有謠言發生，而江門中山，情勢亦嚴重萬分。我們對於整個戰局，不能不重新加以分析，而講求必要的對策。</p>
<p>最近希特勒在歐洲肆行恫嚇，英法美蘇各和平國家，都把視綫集中於歐陸，在日本侵略者看來，這是發動新的對華軍事冒險的最好機會。南昌方面的蠢動，便是日本侵略者對華新進攻的第一步表現。觀於日×最近一面極力促進德意『反共』協定爲軍事同盟，加緊勾結德意，一面又不惜對蘇聯作第二次的屈膝，避免擴大漁業糾紛，就可知道他們加緊軍事冒險實行『降服中國』之攻勢的决心。而所以把『南昌攻略』作爲第一個步驟，則不外下列幾個企圖：第一，佔領南昌，則日×今後一切軍事較可順利進行，而我國東南諸省與西部抗戰根據的聯繫卽有被隔斷的危險。第二，佔領南昌，則日×可以加強其華東佔領區的統治，同時也加緊華中與華北佔領區的聯系。第三，×方可以由此更進一步，西聯鄂湘之×，進逼長沙，打通粤漢路，南應粤海之×，協同西犯，威脅我滇桂。這是日×發動新的軍事冒險的動機。</p>
<p>日×爲要實施『南昌攻略』，事先曾加緊其對鄂西的攻勢，迭次强渡襄河，聲勢汹汹，以圖牽制我方重兵，而掩護其鄂皖贛湘兵力的活動。繼卽開始海空協同的威脅，騷擾浙東沿海，並從杭州方面集中主力强渡錢江，企圖進而截斷浙贛鐵路，牽制東綫我軍，策應『南昌攻略』。終則發動贛北鄱陽湖兩岸的進攻，尤其是在西岸南潯路的兩側，十九日强佔永修，廿日起强渡修水，廿三日越安義奉新，進而迂圍南昌，經過慘烈空前的惡戰以後，我軍依據預定戰略，轉移陣綫。而守城部隊，則誓與城共存亡，巷街血戰，迄今數日，尙未停止。×軍於『南昌攻略』『成功』以後，一面進逼武甯，揚言將攻長沙，打通粤漢全線，一面發動專北攻勢，造成自粤漢南路遙遙策應湘贛戰事的形勢。同時×機×艦，大舉騷擾北海，進逼專南，。這是日×發動新的對華軍事冒險的槪况。</p>
<p>分析目前南北戰事的實際情况，我們至少應該有以下幾個基本的認識：</p>
<p>首先，關於南昌戰事，表面上×軍又佔『勝利』，因爲南昌是我們江南僅存的重要城市，現在南昌失陷，浙贛鐵路已被截斷，東南戰場與西部根據地的聯系遭受更大的困難。反之，日×強佔南昌以後；如果能够進一步完成其與皖贛鄂區的聯絡，則進可以長驅長沙，切斷粤漢路，還可以鞏固東南佔領區，從事於「掃蕩」戰，作進一步侵略的準備。不過實際上南昌退兵，我仍保持全部主力，×軍南昌攻略的第一个企圖即已失敗，浙贛鐵路一時雖成斷絕，但其他道路，大都已經完成；且因我保全主力；現已開始反攻；則×軍南昌攻略的第二個企圖亦巳失敗。而贛鄂湘邊我仍有大量正規及游擊部隊，目前巳展開×後反攻，×人南昌攻略第三個企圖卽進窺長沙的企圖，亦將遭遇重大困難。同時，×人在此南昌攻略中，他依然被迫作爭城市爭交通綫的戰爭，他雖強佔南昌，而其所動員的華中精銳，而巳零星地被我截斷，被我抵任或圍住，他不僅沒有完成其南昌攻略的預定計劃，並且使華中各部隊陷於更大的困境。反之我則保持全部主力，能够運用自如，能够隨時予×以打擊；現在且已分別展開鄂湘邊區及皖南靑陽銅陵等地反攻，使×軍後路及側翼大受打擊。華中×軍要謀進展，將遭更大的困難，這是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>其次，華南戰局，是我們目前所不應忽視的。因爲南昌攻略祇是×軍新的進攻的第一個步驟，南昌佔領雖於×軍有百害無一利，但於其日趨衰落的軍心，表面上不無相當的刺激作用，所以這種攻勢必然又將移到華南戰局場上來。而且在日×看來，西南是我持久抗戰的最後根據，是我國最重大的國際通路所在，其進犯的準傭，今後必更猛烈。目前粤北戰事又趨緊張，北江及粤漢南路×軍大增，並已沿鐵路綫北進，造成牽制湘贛戰綫的形勢；粤南方面×機×艦，連日騷擾北海；同時容奇桂洲，同時失陷，×艦艇駛至鶯哥咀，江門情勢，嚴重異常，中山石歧，同時告急。窺其企圖，顯與南昌攻略相同，主要目的卽在打破五个月來侵華軍事頓挫局面，以振奮其日趨衰落的軍心，同時藉以防制我軍大規模的反攻，鞏固其佔領區的統治，便利親日份子漢奸叛徒以「反共和平」的口號實現『以華制華』的陰謀活動，進一步積極推進其在西南攻略。現在我華南抗戰軍事，在統一的領導之下，政治軍事同時推進，對於×人此種陰謀，必能予以有力的打擊。</p>
<p>最後就全面戰局看來，×軍確已不惜最高度地發揮其僅有的戰鬥力，實施對華軍事冒險的步驟。不過第一，今後×人戰鬥力每一最高度發揮的結果，其力量必更衰落，觀乎徐州武漢南昌陷落之時間距離卽可明白；第二，日×國內與軍隊內部的困難，是隨着新的進攻同時發展並且加倍發展的，觀乎南昌陷落後×軍之銳精盡失不堪再舉卽可明白；第三日×這次南昌攻略和粤南騷動，雖屬聲勢汹汹，含有絕大的冒險性，但因其作戰的退化性的發展，又都是有其消極性，即均以鞏固其佔領區爲主要目的。針對着這些特點，我們令日的對策；在軍事上要努力增强前綫的戰鬬力，擴大×後的游擊戰，制止×人的進攻，推進抗戰的第二階段卽相持階段，首先是以大量運動兵團，增援皖南贛北浙西及專省，發展蘇浙皖邊，鄂湘贛邊和廣東全省的游擊戰，阻止×軍的運動並加以分裂與殲殺。而在政治上，更須適時粉碎一切漢奸親日份孑失敗主義「和平妥協」論調及一切悲觀失望情緒的再度抬頭。因爲×人正在藉其孤注一擲所換得的虛僞的勝利，以欺騙其國人，誘脅我降服，我們不能不加緊警防。不過要打破×奸配合軍事的一切是由政治陰謀，同時還要盡力推動我們自己政治的進步，主要的地方民意機關的建立，來實現全民族力量總動員，以×後抗日部隊與抗日政府的鞏固與擴大，來保證抗戰軍事之順利。日×新的對華軍事冒險已經開始，我們要立刻以軍事上政治上的進步的事實，予以迎頭痛擊。</p>
<h3>日軍在東戰場</h3>
<p>— 梅真</p>
<p>史沫特萊女士的一封信　譯自「密勒氏評論報」</p>
<p>關於日本軍隊自侵華以來在中國大規模的屠殺，掠奪，和××××等事件，我（史沬特萊女士自稱，以下同）並不想寫一篇什麽論文，但對過去數月來在密勒氏評論報所發表關於上述事實的論文，我想發表」點意見和供給一點事實。日軍在中國的×行，確是會使你見了麻木的，任何國家的人民，如未親眼目睹，是不能想像到這些事件是眞實的。</p>
<p>在十月念二日，你的密勒氏評論報廿九　上，重又提出這樣一個問題，指出日本如何將獄中的囚犯都完全徵調到中國來作戰，並且說這是否可以當作日軍×行的說明呢？</p>
<p>不，你弄錯了，事實並不是這樣；卽使將日本全部囚犯編成一技軍隊，他們還是不能負上全部日軍行動的責任的；一則是他們的數目並不多，而且也不是完全被集中在同一系統的部隊裏；二則是那　囚犯並不是眞正的犯罪者，現在大多數的罪犯旣不是殺人犯也不是由於他們的本性，有很多的罪犯，是由於貧窮，在日本則有許多是政治犯——是許多反對目前日本的對建反動的社會與政治制度的人。</p>
<p>日本眞正的殺人犯，眞正的犯罪者，從來不在牢獄裏，而是位居政府，及陸海空軍之要職的。他們憑着殘忍與封建的心理，保持着他們固有的傳統。他們才是眞正的犯罪者，才是眞正負有縱容日軍在華×行的負責者。事實上，我們具有充分的證據來證明日本的高級長官是在故意地縱容他們士兵，要是他們不這樣做，這次的戰事就無法繼續，因為大部份的日本兵士，是整天爲着他們的貧困的家而愁苦着！</p>
<p>日軍的首腦們，縱容他們的兵士，在各被佔領的城市內任意描行，以作給予兵士們的酬報；不僅如此，並且有許多軍官領導兵士放火，掠奪，强×和×殺平民的工作。在南京的日軍當局，還强迫他們每一個乒士去親手×殺俘虜。</p>
<p>如果你讀過那些由日本俘虜身上得來的信扎和日記，尤其是日記，你就能明白他們經常的×行，這些日記的作者，起初不過是一個從普通家庭中出來的人民，到華作戰以後，便到那些妓院中去，即日方所稱「皇軍具樂部」去。在許多日記中，可知起初那些普通人民的轉變，繼而便可探索到他們酒後的狂行的。……</p>
<p>有幾本日記裏，記着高級長官要他他們去×殺全村人口的命令。記得有一本日文的日記，那是我曾經把它譯成英文的，是中村伍長所記，（一九三八年，十月一日晨，在南京西南馬嶺關附近爲新四軍所殺）上面記着當日本補充兵初次看見虐待中國平民俘虜的情形時，莫不神色爲之轉變。中村伍長僅僅簡單明瞭的說，那班補充兵士都是沒有經驗的，還需要好好的訓練才行。那伍長又記載他自己和他的同伴，襲擊洛口鎮某村，在那裏盡二小時之力以獵捕婦女，他的同伴還殺死了一个捕得的女子，「因爲第一次捉來，而她又是這樣難看！我們其餘的人都嘲笑他。」在同一本日記裏、又記載着怎樣捉到三個中國平民，先加嚴刑拷問，直到發了狂才殺他們。在這日記的後面，又記着一則酒後的狂閙的事，這个伍長在日記中又寫明：『娛樂部裏徵來許多姑娘，『如果一個人能够整天像那樣的唱着玩着才妙！』</p>
<p>中村伍長在未來中國之前，是一個端正的平民，到中國來被他長官把他改成了一個×性的人了，這並不是袒護他的話，而且他也是被中國兵士殺掉的，更有他的日記等物，我們必須加以研究，人類决不能在屠殺放火强×等×行上求滿足，除非變成了畜類，這類的行動，我們必須加以相當的對待。</p>
<p>記得在密勒氏評論報上曾登過一篇「蘇州的情况」，那個隱名的作者說：「目前日軍蹂躪中國婦女的事，已經不多，他們僅在中國的妓女身上求滿足」，這一層，我是絕端地否認的，就目前我工作所在的新四軍而言，當他們在南京鎭江區作戰的時候，證明日軍每次得到地方，不是殺戮便是到處獵捕婦女，在一九三八年八月中，新四軍收復了一處村鎭，那裏的傀儡組織——維持會，正在凖備歡迎一隊日方派來的駐軍，那時大約有二百名左右的壯漢，及一些無知的一自衛團」守衛着，新四軍佔據整個維持會，解除了「自衛團」的武裝，並捉住他們的長官，將一切的傀儡人員「自衞團」的長官帶出去舉行公審，如公認有罪的立刻就地槍决。在當時那些證人中，約　有三十個姑娘及少婦——村中，民的妻子們——那就是當地的傀儡們將他們關禁起來用以向日軍献媚的</p>
<p>所以說日軍僅僅徵用中國的妓女。那是不可置信的，卽以全中國的妓女而論，亦不足以供給上海虹口一區日軍的需要。「皇軍俱樂部」裏多數的婦女，都是從各方掠搜得來的。當我在漢口時（指漢口未失時）有一個中國的律師，帶着他的發瘋的妻子，由上海到漢口來。因爲他的妻子曾經被捉到虹口的一家妓院去，結果他話了幾個日本友人在虹口找了幾個星期才將她尋獲，並化去一萬元的賂賄費才將她救出來。</p>
<p>這裏還有一個實例。一九三八年八月底，有三十個新四軍的隊員，出發去調査京滬路上的新豐，看見約模有五十個日軍駐守車站，車站上有從鎭裏虜來的十個中國姑娘。九月一日夜裏，新四軍以手溜彈進襲該站，起先石軍以機關槍應戰，後來退至上層，並將姑娘們看守起來，最後除將整個車站燒燬之外，實無別法，新四軍是這樣做了，爲了消滅這五十個×人，這有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>決不要以為現在有人替日軍掩護×行便信以為真，這是完全靠不住的，中國婦女目前所遭受着的一切厄運，難免不再加到別國婦女的身上，如果是日本軍閥侵華勝利的話。</p>
<p>當然，你說美國人祗爲不能想像到日軍在華的×行，所以常常不相信這些事實，這一層我是同意的。一般的美國人都喜歡一種愉快的結局，而不願遭受任何刺激，你設他們對於那些在日軍×行前攝來的相片表示懷疑，但這並不是這樣，許多相片都是在日本商店中的中國僱員們秘密取來的。在這裏，新四軍有許多的戰利品，其中有完　的旅行照相機，照相册，看去好像是屬於長官們的，因爲該長官攝了許多姿勢的相片，其另外相片則各自分作十數本，是被送往後方本人或者是出賣的。這些照片的大部份，是日軍在殘殺中國平民的場面，往往有幾頁小照上，告訴我們事實的整個塲面。照片上的圖樣是：犧牲者與日軍，平民跪在地面受戮的情形，身首異處，日軍握着血刃傲然立着。</p>
<p>這些相片並沒有被日軍秘密地收藏起來，甚至在每個日軍的佔領區裏都可以買到，因爲日軍視這些照片引以自榮呢！新四軍的司令部裏，還有從作戰中得來的數百封信，有來自日軍的家鄕的，也有來自他們的朋友和姊妹間的，當他們收到那些照片後，有一個妹妹在給她哥哥的信裏說：「當收到你給我那張被你切斷了手足的支那人的相片時，我感到非常難通，不知道對這支那人是同情還是憎恨，</p>
<p>我可以斷定如果那時有照相機的話，那末關於成吉斯汗的游牧軍的屠殺和暴行，也一定有相片傳留下來。日本文化和精神的發展，祗是和幾百年的成吉斯汗游牧民族在同一階段中，雖然前者在表面上加上了一些虛飾，事實上日本在華的戰爭；是比那時野蠻的蒙古人現代化多了，可是當日本的軍隊走進一個中國的城或鎮的時候，他們的行動却和那時的野蠻族沒有分別。</p>
<p>我們决不能被日本的政治陰謀所欺瞞，在漢口等大城市中日軍朋以沒有像別地一樣行兇的緣故，是爲了要使他們在華的暴行不致傳揚開去，抵制日貨運動和日政府不能獲得英美借欽，便是這些政治陰謀的由來。但是他們的×性是一些也沒有改變，僅暫時地把他們對世界的面目稍加掩飾而已。直到他們獲得了基金來繼續戰勝中國的時候。關於日本這種政治陰謀的原因，就是要誘導汪精衞和他的黨羽去背叛他們的祖國，</p>
<p>今以貴刊（指密勒氏評論報）一讀者的資格，很想請你把你所有一切關於日軍在華×殺，放火以及蹂躪婦女等照片刊露出來。其餘的雜誌或許要遲疑，但我相信貴刊是有勇氣的。卽使中國的婦女能忍受着加在她們身上的苦痛，然而我們異國人則應加以反對的，藏惹這些照相卽是保護了日本×國主義。我們必須將日軍在華行動的每一面都顯示到全世界人民的面前，這並不想去感動德國，意大利，因爲他們過去和現在的行爲，是和日本一樣的，雖然前者並沒有把他們的行動顯露在照片上。日本，德國和意大利，是無分軒輊的，他們是世界上的恣意橫行者—這就是我們見到的法西斯—是囘到野蠻主義的法西斯！</p>
<p>今天在中國所見到的一切，明天就會在別國冉見！日本祗想用中國作他繼續侵略全亞洲及世界各國的根據地！</p>

<h3>浙東戰區雜話</h3>
<p>— Donald　M．Cavies著　黃健彬譯</p>
<p>——一個外國記者的報告</p>
<p>本文作者Davies生於我國，能操流利華語，任「美商聯合出版社」通訊員，遍遊內地，曾居重慶數月，近且轉入杭州附近游擊區，於日軍前衛地帶作短期旅行後，寫就本文；日來杭州灣錢塘江×人，調兵遺將，蠢蠢欲動，浙東形勢緊張，本文乃將當地近況報道，頗爲詳盡，×我狀態，可見一斑。Davies現已由滬啓程赴美，擬經菲列濱印度及巴勒斯登等地云。</p>
<p>浙江沿海八萬農民，一萬有組織的游擊隊和一隊人數較少的變相正規軍，由於紹興附近某地的大量軍火接濟，都武裝起來實行抗日了。</p>
<p>這些部隊的戰術，和著名的第八路軍，新四軍所採用者盡同。後者是共產黨的組織，但浙江的部隊郤沒有這種關係存乎其間。少數份子是國民黨員，其餘盡慶無黨無派。</p>
<p>他們的任務是破壞交通綫，攻擊駐防据點，竊取糧食和軍火給養。譬如下面所記的，便是兩個可靠的實例：</p>
<p>最近的一個夜裏，一隊游擊隊伍集結在錢塘江南岸，渡河以後埋伏於日軍中心駐防地附近的竹林裏，靜待天明。他們埋伏的地方離日軍操場不過二百米突。侵略者都出來早操了，然後他們放下兵噐，集隊恭聽軍官講解擊破華軍高論，這時候游擊隊等得不耐煩了，集中火力，機關槍來福槍齊鳴，殺得皇軍好不傷心。結果，日軍死了一百人，受傷的不少。中國人呢，死傷不够二十個。</p>
<p>大美報載有許多車輛裝載狂妄的受傷皇軍運回上海的消息，並且承認這個戰役由于華軍企圖克復杭州所致。日本的報告郤力証華軍進襲失敗，受了嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>這些活躍于杭州的衞士，正像其他各地的衞士一樣，只要在有利的環　內，一定佔優勝的。他們以少數人的胃險，結果把三比對一的中日損失對比，根本爲之逆轉，有利於中國。</p>
<p>中國人運用他們的智慧，又幹了另一椿駭人的事蹟，一百名日本騎兵，由杭州某戍地開往另一戍地。游擊隊伍全部埋伏在塚穴後，等待敵人通過選好了的有利地形時，鬥士的機關槍又一次開始怒吼了，大隊騎兵一時猝不及備，入於紛亂狀態，滾下馬來，藏身馬後，掩護自己，逃命的就一溜烟跑光了。留下來的人迫得作一次劇烈的肉搏，雙方都有死傷，結果中國又賺取了勝利，還俘獲了不少軍用品。上述兩次事件，全由一位留守杭州附近某城的游擊隊長吿訴我的。</p>
<p>淪陷區跌路員工。往日是小心翼翼保護路軌，力求行旅安全，目下全都加入游擊隊去拆毀路軌了。小孩子們也來參加，担任宣傳，募捐，警戒工作。巳成立的兩小隊，一是少年模範團，一是少女模範團，前者人數一百，後者四十。一隊由廿人組織的婦女志願團，以體力不足被拒絕成立了。婦女們多半是學生，她們捨棄了學校，離開了密接戰區的杭州西南某城，定上前線去保衛自己的國家。</p>
<p>另一少年組織是童子軍，他們担任收集碎鐵，獻金，軍糧等各種。還有許多學生祖任政訓，宣傳工作。</p>
<p>戰術　然得到運用的成功了。日軍佔領浙北一年，所得不過十一縣，無關重要（全省共有七十五縣。）</p>
<p>全省抗敵情緒委實高漲。某軍官對此解　爲日軍佔領一城一池之必　結果。他說：『日人的暴戾兇狠，迫使人民起而反抗。』這話給千千萬萬的華人加以證實　訛。</p>
<p>游擊隊糧食似乎異常充足。游擊區內每袋米僅値八九元，而紹興方面非十二元不可。農民市民莫不藏米草莽中，懸掛大樹上，以備接濟游擊隊。日軍離營時間極少。因爲這是一件冒險的事，卽使偶然出外，也不敢駐足搜索，恐怕突然一個侵襲會平空而來。但當地部隊，郤能予取予求，行若無事。豬鷄都可用適　代價購得，據說城裏的人每當黎明時份，把罐頭食物送給游擊隊，算是保衛家鄕的報酬。</p>
<p>我看見的游擊隊多半衣履足用，體健心寬的多半受過敎育，他們不但可以負責省防軍事，還可傲更偉大的工作。</p>
<p>全省日軍據估計有二萬人，內有高麗人台灣人，次貨居多，作戰情緒低下。中國方面的報吿，多數日軍都　未成了的少年，僅受起碼的訓練。這種報吿我不能絕對證實。據較可靠的消息，日方軍備只可列入次等而已。</p>
<p>浙北劃入第三戰區，歸顧祝同將軍主持，我沒有機會去考察，所見各省防部隊都是黃紹雄主席組織的。他們是當地的土著，新卯軍的份子，多半來自江西，以共產軍『長征』以後殘存籍省的隊伍爲基幹。</p>
<p>浙省共有五個訓練營，每月征兵約　一萬六千人。受訓期爲三個月。</p>
<p>正規軍乃由舊日警察、農民、小　人的兒子組合而成，他們的家鄕全被日軍形式或實際佔領了，他們採取機動戰術，視爲游擊隊亦未嘗不可。訓練課程有學術兩科。他們學習兵法初步，學習欺騙，突擊敵人的簡易游擊戰術。</p>

<h3>廣東政治的新途經　（二）</h3>
<p>— 李育中</p>
<p>韶關特約通訊</p>
<p>三　民眾生活會否改善</p>
<p>政府方面、雖然明令　除許多種捐稅、然而不普遍，不切實，民　的生活，尙離應有改善的程度很遠。因爲：一，民衆負担不合理，不能眞止的「有錢出錢，有力出力』。像銷公債是攤派的，窮富一樣，兵役夫役每被保甲長藉端蔽榨。又，舊的負祖沒有減少，新的負担又來了·三，民眾的被　，沒有得到相當的救濟，往往流離失所。</p>
<p>四　貪污現象會否　清</p>
<p>東向稱富裕，而貪汚現象，亦特別驚人。抗戰以來，雖然好了些，但：（一）公債方面，强雖敲榨造成很多中飽的事實，如某縣的公債額，是推銷四萬元，可是到了縣長的手裏，便提高到六萬元，區鄕保甲長的從而剝削，自不在話下了·（二）　役方面·鄕保甲長利用之賺錢，曲江某區的巡官李某，藉拉夫而發國難財，正是最近的事實·（三）捐則存在僞報現象．（四）走私方面，更是嚴重，廣州失陷，就是一個血的敎訓，（五）公家買賣方面的折扣，尤其是發住在購用軍用品的，交易上，據說有一次從外國　入一批通儀噐材價只二十萬，而單据上却寫了八十萬，（六）軍隊中的扣餉呑兵額僞据，呑公債金等現象，仍未剷除凈盡·（七）卽使在下的如下鄉收稅捐的走卒，也勒索茶水和手續費。這貪汚現象，存在的原因：二，公務員的政治敎育缺乏，披了抗戰的外衣，打升官發財的算盤；二，政府沒有建立嚴密的檢査制度，即使有「親察專員」也形　虛設，沒有好好的運用以收到應有的效果；三，政治紀律沒有　到應　嚴　，致使食汚現象，當作家常便飯；四，民衆沒有充分揭發貪汚的　會；五，任用私人狼狽爲奸，不是　工作而用人，只是為牟利爲人情　用人·（未完）</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<h3>青年新聞記者學會香港分會主辦的　中國新聞學院成立　是作育新的新聞戰士的一個大機關</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>自從聖神的抗戰展開，每一個中華民挨的好兒女，都熱烈地將他們的財，他們的力，貢獻給祖國直接間接地打擊我們的×人，於是全中國的新聞記者。也馱起他們的武噐—桿，站上了的文化崗位英勇地爲祖國抗戰而鬥爭着。徐州大會戰，保衛大武漢……在各個神聖的戰役中，新聞記者都是以百折不撓的精神戰到最後一秒鐘纔轉移新陣地的；還有，在×人的炮火和炸彈的摧殘下，被迫而停刊的報紙，着實不少，但是。很快很快，它們又建立起新的生命來（像本報就是一個鮮明的例證）。現在，無論大小型的報紙。都蓬勃地滋長在各都市。縣鎭，甚至窮鄉僻壤裏，這實在是現階段新聞界一個良好的現象啊！</p>
<p>緊接着新的新聞事業的發展，新的新聞鬥士的大量需要，這是無可韙言的。中國靑年新聞記者學會香港分會，有見及此，便計劃着設立一所中國新聞學院，預備大量的做就新聞幹部人材，積極充實我們新聞戰綫的力量，這實在是新聞界一件不可忽視的工作。</p>
<p>經過了兩個多月的籌備奔走，和獲從了很多黨政，和敎育界的名流，新聞界的先進，社會名流等各界熱烈的贊助下，這個計劃，便很迅速地實現起來了。聽說董事長是中央賑濟委員會代會長許世英先生，副董事長是名敎育家陶行知先生，名流像杜月笙先生，王曉賴先生，阮維揚先生，何艾齡博士，新聞界先進像金誠夫先生（大公報總編輯）和港中各大報社新聞界知名人士，都是學院裏的董事。院長則是本報總編輯郭步陶先生，副院長是金仲華先生，（星島日報　編輯），敎務主任譚思文先生（珠江報編輯），敎師有吳範圍（立報經理），許君道（大公報編輯），羅呢圃（星報總經理），王紀元（前申報編輯）、劉思慕（世界知識編輯），潘朗（本報編輯），梁式文（廣州大畢敎授），葉啟芳（星島　報編輯），鄭森禹（前月報編輯），還有很多報界的名縮，都願意爲作育這羣新的聞戰士而努力，而且還獲得中華中學的校長黃詛芬慨充報効課室做中國新開學院的院址。社會人士對訓練新聞的人材這樣熱切，這該是一個可喜的現像吧！</p>
<p>爲了符台大量造就堅苦耐勞的新聞戰士的宗旨，這個新聞學院用最短促六個月的期間爲一期，每星期除掉星期六星期日兩天外，每天晚上都照常上課，而且取費也非常低廉每期不過五塊錢的學費，不過質和量方面都有嚴格的限制，每期袛招收男女生六十餘名，額滿便停止收納。入學的資格要有高中畢業程度或同等的學歷，纔可投考，而且對於各國語言，各地方言，攝影駕駛單車汽車寫針筆版等專門技術，亦均分別予以登記。課程計分：一，報館經營法，二，新聞編輯法；三，新聞探訪法。四，經濟新聞；五資料整理法，六，社會新聞；七，國際新聞，八，政治學，九，中國現代史，十，臨時講座。</p>
<p>聽說入學的測驗在四月十六日下午一時在該學院（中華中學）舉行，入學的測騐題目，計分一、國文，二、常識（包括中外史地政治經濟國內國際時事問題）開學的日期是在四月廿四日那天，報名的手續由卽日起到四月十五日止，每天下午之點到是報名的時間，報名者要携帶自己最近的四寸半身相片一張和一切證明的文件到記者學會（干諾道中二十二號四樓）滇寫報各的表册。</p>
<p>我們具有同等學歷，有志於新聞事業的堅實的靑年鬥士，趕速報名投考啊。</p>

<h3>把救亡宣傳從前線擴展到海外去　救亡劇團將出國</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>中華民放優秀的兒女：金山，王瑩會見記</p>
<p>慚愧，感奮，匯成了洵湧的心潮。記者忐忑地盼不得這個使人樂觀、使人積極的喜訊迅速地呈現於親愛的讀者之前，因爲，這中間都是活生生的事　，却不是二件平凡的新聞啊！</p>
<p>「上海救亡演劇第二隊」這個名字，以及它輾轉長征東南西南各戰場各後方的精神與成績，我們在本報特派記者賡雅先生的「救亡團體在桂林（見一月廿四五日本報）一文中，早巳心神響往，無限感慰了。</p>
<p>熟和力寫成的史蹟</p>
<p>他們自去年八月間離滬，歷經蘇州，南京，徐州，開封，鄭州，洛陽，漢口以及大別山脉內的商城，麻城等縣，再沿粤漢路南下，轉湘入桂，一路以演劇　詠去宣傳民衆，敎育民衆，動員民衆，得着很好的成積，因爲工作的努力，生活的嚴肅，到處更得到軍政當局和社會人士的讚許和歡迎，現在他們爲要把救亡宣傳擴展，到海外去，同時替前綫將士向僑胞呼籲，特决定前往南洋新嘉坡，菲律濱　金山一帶，從事海外宣傳，現在，他們已於日昨由桂　程海防到港了，這消息，首見　日本報特訊。昨天，記者特地前往訪向，幷致敬　之意，他們苦幹的精神和英勇的努力，更是親切的感覺到了：</p>
<p>該隊原是上海戲劇界救亡協會戰時移動演據隊十五隊中之一、在上海出發時僅十四人，領隊的是前進的電影明星金山先生和王瑩女士，在長征的沿途中曾吸引不少優秀的同志，全體隊員都是熱情救亡工作者幷對戲據深感興趣的關係，在長征各地中　每個人都出錢又出力「，一年多來，無論到都市，鄉村，上自每日演劇三場，下辛私人洗衣，補襪，搬運行李等工作。全要自己去實行「勞工神聖一。住則房間二個，男女各一，均以睡地鋪爲原則。吃穿更力求平民化，團體日記賣出所得稿費的全部，隊員私人寫作稿費三分之二，都作爲公開，理髮洗衣和寄信，規定每人每月只發大洋三元，他們的約法三章是：一，全隊只有團體無個人，生死甘苦共之，工作高於一切，一切服從工作；二對外一切經濟事務，完全公開；三，與工作無關之一切公私宴會，概行辭謝。這種苦幹的精神，實在令人感佩：在走遍江，浙見皖，鄂，湘，桂幾省的前綫和後方的苦幹過程　，他們已經有過了七百餘次的表演，出入槍林彈雨的前綫，踏遍荒僻崎嘔的後方，</p>
<p>有一次是在蚌埠的地方，那眞危險極了—七十七架×機飛得很低，氣壓將樹吹低了頭，一連投很多炸彈，差點兒王瑩女士亦幾乎被炸死，當時全身泥土烟屑，金山同志來找她，走過身邊，還認不出，這眞是太寳貴的經驗了。他們工作的態度亦很誠懇坦白，凡與幾個團體聯合工作，就是先選苦的去做，把自已團體名稱擺在最後。</p>
<p>他們利用熱和力，　去鼓勵浴血苦戰的前方將士，去動員廣大的後方羣衆「，到處散佈着抗戰救亡的種子，到處得到了美滿的成績，尤其在台兒莊戰役的前後，他們到了徐州，成爲當時鼓勵兵士和動員靑年羣衆去保衞大徐州的一支最有力的宣傳隊，最近數月輾轉去湘桂間努力工作，積極動員着廣大的後方同胞·一年來，抱着救亡的决心，在轟炸下來去，在艱苦中鬥爭，以熱和力寫成了偉大的史蹟—</p>
<p>金山談近況與計劃</p>
<p>金山先生，是一個著名的前進的電影明星，同時亦是一個熱情的活潑的苦幹靑年，因爲他說反對明星的頭銜，自謂是一個工作者，記者就稱他是一個實幹的靑年吧。這位實幹的靑年，就是該團的隊長。該團在內地原稱上海救亡演劇的第二隊，現在是改稱爲「中國救亡劇團』了。</p>
<p>他們全體團員現有三十二人，六位是女性。因爲船票關係，有廿幾位下一次船才得全行。爲了宣慰僑胞，動員僑胞的非常任務，該團將繼續以救亡戲劇，長征薪新嘉坡，菲律賓，舊金山一帶，預計六個月後再返囘前綫服務。他們在前線與後方演劇，山地，曠野，街頭，隨處都是舞台，所謂佈景，亦就來得十分簡單。要出國，佈景，道具，就得好好準備。爲了拍製電影，就應該購置機器。年來長征的紀錄文獻，亦得加以整　，以便傳播到海外去。所以整理與準備。就是該團來港的主要任務。時間約有一二個月的勾留。俟籌備就緒，擬在他們幾十個劇本中，選擇一些可以在本港公演的，和本港僑胞見見面，那是一個多麽使人興奮的消息，可以預吿的劇目是：「民族萬歲」，「一年間」，了保衛祖國」，「新生的中國」，「台兒莊之戰」及其他短劇。</p>
<p>金先生還說：爲使僑胞澈底認識抗戰的現勢，最後勝利必屬於我，不爲二城一池之失而懊喪灰心，所以向白崇禧將軍要求派一位軍事專家，目親身參加過抗戰的，隨隊出發，以便嘗慰華僑。蒙白先生慨允，派前在大場之役任某師政治部主任，現任廣西學生軍第一團團長林樞先生，協同工作，眞是十分難得。記者對林先生亦有所聆敎，賢勞可佩。關于林先生一席話，候另文介紹，在此不贅。</p>
<p>這次出發他們的經費有的是朋友帮忙，有的是政府當局津貼。團員每月三元錢，到了香港，可改爲港幣。金先生還謂：「如果接濟不來，就得欠薪」他們追求的是精紳上的安慰，不是警覺的靑年，是不容易安於這種生活的。</p>

<h3>粵南安谧　沿海×艦減少　×為掩飾空虛故作侵犯烟幕　×一部撤離我軍乘時活動</h3>
<p>【南路快訊】粤南沿海×艦、時來時去、故形勢亦張弛無定、據最近情報、×艦自廿三日一度擾犯北海不逞後、連日忽陸續向東駛去、故南路情勢日趨穩定、茲將最近各情報訪誌如下、</p>
<p>沿海×艦減少</p>
<p>邇來×艦雲集於南路沿海、梭巡窺伺、及封鎖我海岸綫、艦數總在三四十艘、並時作飽轟舉動、故甫路坊務日來迭吿緊張、但昨廿六日軍事機關接得情報、×艦一部忽陸續他駛、雷州半島東塲尖角、水交、烏石等港附近海面、原各泊有×艦一二艘、均於廿四廿五兩日駛去、僅海安港及北海附近白虎頭、冠頭嶺、仍將有×艦三數艘游弋、瓊崖方面、集中於海口者、約七八艘、楡林港泊×艦數艘、統計夸南×艦、共約二十艘左右、較旬前巳減少、聞係因粤三角洲戰事緊張、趕往增援所致、但×爲掩飾其抽調空虛、廿四、什五、什六各日游戈於欽廉沿海之電艦、常發炮向我岸上遙轟、及派遣橡皮艇在各港口外測探水道、故作登陸模樣、以圖恐嚇騷擾、我當局已洞悉×詭謀、故除監視外、未予理會、</p>
<p>粵南人心安</p>

<p>島×兵撤退</p>
<p>又據此間北海接發　、事長官電吿、侵瓊×軍、經我軍民月來英勇抗戰後、現已中　進前、侷處於沿海地區、構築防禦工事固守、並積極開闢海口、文昌、崖縣飛機場、及楡林三亞海口、等軍海、以爲海空軍根據地、惟全島所有×陸軍、自旬前迭次增援後、現又分別撤退、本月廿三日、有×二千餘人分乘運輸艦數艘、向東面駛去、昨日續有×兵千餘、撤離該島、均於深夜開間拔、據悉係增防廣州、但屯儲於海口及瓊山之×軍械輜重、則未見　移、現盤據瓊島之×、共約六七千人、實力異常單薄、故我各地游擊隊乘時活躍、前日又向盤據定安城之×進襲，我隊百餘人，曾一度衝進城內，與×發生激戰、擊斃×兵四五十人，現×忿怒異常、對我各丁鄕壯丁、大肆屠殺凌辱、情狀殊慘云、</p>
<h3>九江我急備反攻　×調片部圖死守　×強迫令商民復業　勒樓商業悉陷停頓</h3>
<p>（南海快訊）盤據龍江×軍、前爲支松部隊、隸屬九江×司令指揮、査廿六日忽然更調由佛山改派片野聯隊一部二百餘人開到接防、其原因係九江×司令近探悉我西江南岸大軍雲集、準備反攻、乃將龍江×軍調囘增防、以圖死守、査該新開龍江之片野部隊、現駐墟尾之凉亭絲行兩處、並發出恐　佈吿、迫令龍江墟內之商民、限于廿五日內一律返墟開舖營業、否則實行査封、招商開投傢私、但當地民衆慘遭蹂躪、損失凈盡、一摘何堪再摘、均寧願犧牲、亦不肯返墟復業、故市面情形、×軍雖力謀恢復、迄今仍無絲毫結果、　條恐怖狀態、令人生畏、又助樓×軍上週撤退後、每隔三兩日內×軍必到一次、到時卽大肆搶掠、故墟內店舖已悉陷停頓狀態、惟烟賭林立、大有五步一樓、十步一閣之勢、形成畸形狀態云、</p>
<h3>經濟部電各機關　禁講東西四省產品　表列參等二十二種</h3>

<h3>東江上游　交通增暢</h3>

<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>以性命換錢的人　工作險而收入多</h3>
<p>在Jesse　James一片中、泰隆鮑華騎了一匹馬從七干尺高的地方躍入水中………爲了這一幕、專演驚險場面的人克利夫里昂斯工作兩小時賺了一七七〇金元、在Dodge　City　一片、你們會看到三個人在距地面廿二尺高的陽台上毆鬥、打到難分難解時、把欄杆撞斷、同時墮落到下面的一張輪盤賭檯上、這一幕、克利夫里昂斯、哈萊巴利和林克格蘭合得一四四五金元、每人分得四八五元、表演驚險場面的人的工作固然危險、可是工作鐘點旣少、報酬又很豐富、</p>
<p>這些人每日可得三十五元的薪金、但是做們的這點報酬的確是最不容易拿的、有一個規定、只要導演能够想得出無論那一種驚險的塲面、都須由他們表演、譬如里昂斯要從四十尺高度躍入深水裏、只有七十五元報酬、如果他在同樣高度躍下、而水池裏的水並不深的話、那麼代價便要高至三百五十元了、從一道樓梯上滾下來價五十元、但是如果這樓梯是彎曲的、價錢便要增至一百廿五元、假如必要時、他們應和另一個演員一同由高處跌下、或者別的場面、那代價便更大、因爲和別人在一起、自己的把握總要小一點、</p>
<p>表演驚險場面的人、每年收入平均爲七千五百元、有些年份、當緊張刺激影片盛行時、他們的收入常常高至一萬八千元、他們之中有些做　些工作已有廿五年、普通這種表演人在銀幕上的壽命不過十三年、因爲他們都是很有把握很熟練的、所以英國的勞合保險公司認爲替他們保險、比之警察和救火員更穩妥些、最近十年內、他們裏面從來沒有死亡過一個人、外間想加入他們的工會裏的人很多、巳登記爲候補人的有一千人、可是他的團體是比無論什麽都更不容易加入、</p>
<p>他們最恨音樂片、因爲音樂片决對用不到他們、是他們的死對頭、常常因爲昔樂片盛行、便把他們賴以衣食的影片束之高閣、</p>
<p>影片如Jesse　Jamea'DOdge　City'羅賓漢、Wells　Fatgo、遍地黃金、Stand　up　and　Fight’劍客、Suez＇是他們最歡迎的、有時他們答應了表演一個驚險的鏡頭了、可是防止虐待動物會的人千涉進來、結果只好停止了、里昂斯從七十尺騎馬躍入水裏這鏡頭是受加州禁止的、所以只好把這部影片拿到南部去攝襲、可是對動物雖然如此、却始終沒有什廿一例不許『人』去表演這種九死一生的戲、這也是一種怪現象、</p>
<p>除了這十八位專家外（爲首是巴萊）、還有兩個別的組——騎術演員和飛行家這兩個組織、這三個團體是各有地盤互不侵犯的、把一架飛機撞碎或是從馬上跌下來是他們專有的特殊技能、所以要每日練習、否則一有失誤、連性命也要送去了、</p>
<p>好萊塢電影界有趣的幕後事情之一、便是在拍着像Dodge　City這一類片時、看到影片公司的組長、導演和表演驚險鏡頭的人的討論這一幕戲的價錢、首先導演不憚煩地把他所計劃的要把這幕怎樣拍的法子說過了、然後表演的人　照樣試了一次、試完之後、他便决定這一幕戲的代價須八五元、導演聽了便大發雷霆、　於是一個表演的人便向他問、「導演先生、加果你去表演、你要多少代價呢？」導演便興奮地囘答、「這個却不同了、我不是吃這一門飯的、「於時他們妥協了、——仍舊是四八五元、</p>
<p>他們的技術雖然高明、可是對馬匹的殘虐常常雞免、最普通的是用一根鉛絲套在馬蹄上、算好了尺寸、使它跌倒時剛在　影機前面、當你們看到一匹飛馳着的馬、突然給一根看不見的鉛絲絆了、一個跟斗翻倒起來、把馬上的人掀了下來、這是多麽精采的鏡頭啊、可是你曾想到那些可憐的馬嗎？</p>
<p>在英國使要比較好得多、因爲英國人對馬匹最爲鍾愛、對於影片中用到馬匹的地方、尤爲注意、須對馬匹沒有絲毫虐待、始能准許通過許開映、</p>
<p>我剛才說過表演驚險場面的人、很少受傷的、但是意外終於難免、譬如爲首的巴萊、他過去表演過從高崖墮下、撞車墮馬、驚險毆鬥、種　　人場面不知多少次、從來沒有有一次傷而至不能工作、可是有一次、他扮兩醉漢之一、走過路邊時給雪滑跌、這本來是很容易的事、可是他結果竟至背骨斷折、因爲雪裏有一根木樁、他沒有曉得呢、　雖是一個「三十年老娘倒　孩兒」十二分意想不到的事、可是由此也可見吃這碗飯之不易了</p>
<h3>瓊克勞離婚案　改期在審</h3>
<p>【路透社好萊塢廿八日電】電影明星瓊克勞馥前向法庭、麽提出要求　佛　却　離異案、因其本人今日未能到　、作洪、故法庭判决將該案押候四月十八日再審、</p>
<h3>公牛裴迪南　在德意日禁</h3>
<p>影片英雄是一向爲人所蒙敬的、製片家也深明觀衆的心理、大製其英雄美人的武俠巨片、</p>
<p>可是你看過華爾狄斯耐的新卡通、公牛裴迪南（Fardfnand　TheBull）麽、他不愛鬥、無論鬥牛人如何挑戰、甚至屈膝求戰、它都置之不理、祗是嗅人們擲下來的花來結果、它被送回去了、坐在樹下、懶洋洋地嗅着花香、悠悠然的過寧場靜的日子、</p>
<p>這張片子在各國都受盛大的歡迎，可是這對於愛戰的英雄們朱免是個重大的侮辱，在德意日三國家被禁映了、</p>
<p>裴迪南的精神固然未足效法，可是橫加禁映，也大可不必，無以名之，曰，「缺乏幽默感」、</p>
<h3>埃洛弗林　好勇門很</h3>
<p>埃洛弗林在銀幕上大都是演路見不平、拔刀相助的英雄的、在他平日的私生活裏、他也是個愛打架的人、雖然動機是否一定對、這不敢說、至少在愛打架這一點上是和他銀幕性格符合的、他曾在某次的宴會席上、跟二十世紀福斯的一位高級職員發生衝突、大打出手、兩人打得如此緊張熱閙以致女主人這一次宴會、臨時只好改期、</p>
<p>埃洛爾嘴唇打裂出血、一隻牙齒也打壞了、第二天拍戲時、只好多拍側面、他的對手更為吃　、下頗打傷、一天不能工作、</p>

<p>【本報專訊】丙組足球聯賽、冠軍已爲十葛所得，至亞軍一席、猶在競爭中、迨昨日下午五時一刻、南華與卅營炮兵爭亞軍决賽權於杳港會場、結果二比三南華先勝後敗、亞軍因此而絕望、殊可惜也、</p>
<p>全賽過程、炮兵各員憑藉身段高大、遂常佔優勢、惟技術演出平庸、開賽不久、南華乘角球之便、先下一關、惟不旋踵即被炮兵反攻得手、以一比一完上半時、</p>
<p>下半場再戰不久，南華乘十二碼球之利、以二比一領先、惟砲兵攻勢甚急、未够兩分鐘、便連獲兩球、反以三比二終局、今炮兵旣得亞軍决賽權、則于四月一日（星期六）與飛機隊决賽、以爭亞軍一席、錄昨日南華陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>關于香港的學校體育　（一）</h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>關子香港的學校體育、在表面看來、似覺是蓬蓬勃勃、不過在事實　的考査、研究、眞是會令人發笑、我在廣州時，因爲只憑側方面的消息、總以爲香港的學校體育事業、必有很樂觀的現象、極其普遍、極爲發達、但到港工作之後、才能够切實的明瞭、香港的體育，究是什麼的體育、事實上、還是走不脫風頭主義、和選手制度的圈套、雖近來很多體育同志、也能够去鼓吹吶喊—要怎樣的「體育普遍化」「打倒選手體育」等等、究其所行、仍是風頭的方式，甚至收買選手等，由此着來、一般人雖有改革的思想，但欠于實行，所以還要希望着學校體育行政的同志們、能够再加强一點「行』的意志、現將過去或現在學校體育的缺點、及其應興應革的事實、分述于后、</p>
<p>（一）體育在一般</p>
<p>學校的地位</p>
<p>在敎育部的規定、中等（以學生人數爲標準）的學校，應有主任指導、和指導員各一人、中等以上的、應有指導員二人、連主任指導三人以上、至最小的、（百人以上的）學校、都應該有指導員一人、對于學校的體育經費、是獨立的、但在香港一般的學校看來、體育的地位太低了、有很多學校、簡直體育科也沒有、間或有的、都是隨便拉一人來祖任、敎以幾　普通操　及其他不文不類的　脚技術、在上課時、任學生自由便就算了事、至稍能注意的都是在選手方面着想、關于出風頭的體育、並未能够看得到體育應有它高上的地位、與高上的品格（道德）、必不能任由他人的利用、各界人士亦不應該去利用體育、沾汚了體育、應要顧　體育的道德與地位，所以、我很希望各學校執事、應要球重體育道德、（未完＋</p>

<h3>歡迎星洲足球界的同胞　（三）</h3>
<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>（六）鄧約翰一九三一年到過祖國、但凡曾和他接觸過的球友、都領略過他的守衞術了、他不特是中後衛的良材，而且田徑方面也很有成就，這回隨隊作「賽球領隊」，我們一定有機會鑒　他的　技</p>
<p>（七）左中衞林志泉。是我本人認爲前年世運隊左中衞的理想人物，他冷靜的頭腦和　人的機智，使他短小的身材毫不吃虧。他傳交準確，敏捷耐戰，環顧今之國內·實無足比擬，可惜他因事放棄被選權，連足球也不再玩了，如此良材，祗　花一現。眞足球界之大損失。</p>
<p>上面　舉的是鐵中錚錚，是足球界風之毛，麟之角，極難發現的慧星，其他尙有傑出的名將。讓我也把他們的名字報道一下、（一）楊亞九（守門）、（二）陳玉書後衛、（三）蔡耀順（後衞）、（四）鍾子林（中緊），（五）馮文動（左翼）、（六）蔡坤安（右翼）、和現目隨隊的新星、（一）李柏棠（守門）、（二）朱成貴（中堅）、（三）許厚坤（左前衛）、（四）紀友齡（右前衛），（五）吳占士（右翼）、（六）陳開萬（譽爲全馬來亞最佳的右術）、上述諸人都是足球界不可多覩的英材，還有最近發現而未經筆者眼見的好手二恐怕也爲　不少，括而言之、星洲華隊的實力、實足予　東方面任何一隊以無上的威脅，可無疑義、</p>
<p>我們這番有那鼓掌歡迎他們登場献技的良機、同時也可看作國內國外華人足球實力互相較量的一個巧遇　合、無論誰勝誰敗、球友方面當然是一心一志地　這機緣作進一步技巧上的研求、觀客方面、也一定嘉善矜不能地專來欣賞眞藝術、他們勝了，我們固應鼓掌頌揚、設使不幸他們敗了、他們盡過人事、也該稱許也們奮鬥的精神、我們萬衆一心，唯一的希望是他們能在這一次的長征中、把他們本身的短處發覺出來努力地改善，　地們的球　百尺竿、更推進到高妙一層的境域、在星洲和馬來亞一帶的體育　裏、爲有東亞病夫尊號的華吐氣揚眉，爭點榮譽二</p>
<p>捧出了虔摯的心、讓我替這一羣好友祝福、「港居舒適、無恙歸星」、（完）</p>

<h3>馬德里城出奔的喜劇</h3>
<p>— Guzinan　莊重譯</p>
<p>這里寫的不是一編戲劇，也不是一小說，而是一篇事實。照現在流行的話，是一篇報吿文學。這是從古斯曼著的：紅黑的馬德里一書中，摘譯出來的。因爲其中關於武裝民衆阻止逃亡的部畏們的一段叙述，寫得很有趣，所以我『杜撰』給它擬了這一個　目。</p>
<p>顯宦高官們的生命，一向總比平民的要來得「金貴」，不管古今中外，都是如此。每當危險當頭之際，最先逃跑的就是他們，我希望中國的民衆，也有一天能像西班牙的人民那樣，給這班愛錢又愛命的傢伙一點敎訓。</p>
<p>十一月七日的淸早，戰鬥依舊苦慘地在繼續着。無數的新的工人羣衆不停地向着那受威脅的各區出發，他們大多數是沒有武器的，他們在等待着獲取戰死者遺下來的　械。像七有間那樣，人們爭着搶着槍枝。置身於最危險的崗位，在那些牆脚下，在那些暫作爲堡壘的家屋里頭，工人們不斷地對着×人射擊着。每一個槍聲都是全民意志每一次的表現：</p>
<p>—不許通過—</p>
<p>飛機結羣在飛，唐克向前衝着，砲聲震耳欲聾，戰鬥已到了不能形容的激烈。在加拉拉班査爾區地方，有若干隊伍向後逐漸退却，×人已衝破了我們的防綫，迫近多力陀橋來了。於是從旁的地方跑來了若干同志（指安那其主義者而言！譯言）在他們的前頭有伊沙白洛，羅默親和華安，多列斯。他們怒吼着：</p>
<p>——卑怯的東西；卑怯的東西！</p>
<p>好多人羞愧地停止了。好多人狼狽地仍想向後逃。手槍對準他們的頭上，他們沒有法子只好囘轉去，他們散佈在橋邊，在牆壁後面，好多同志都受到命令不准任何人私逃，伊沙白洛爬上一個窗口，大聲喊道：</p>
<p>——同志們，和他們拚去！進！CNT萬歲！</p>
<p>伊沙白洛係省委員的書記（指安那其派CNT所屬的該省委員會）。他也站在那些牆壁下面射擊，像所有我們的人們一樣，那些奔逃的，是另外一班人。大家跟在伊沙白洛和多列斯的後面，像雪崩那樣，破毀了法西斯前進的隊伍，無數的摩爾人整堆成疊的倒積在半島道上。我們的隊伍向前猛追，追過了屠獸場，一直到下加拉拉班査爾。敵人再不能通過這裏了。</p>
<p>同樣不能通過烏石拉，不能通過維耶威爾特，也不通過埃斯脫力馬杜拉大道。馬德里全體都起來了。共和黨，社會黨共產黨以及安那其主義者，都係自巳的同胞兄弟一樣，摩肩擦肘的站在同一戰綫上，共同奮鬥决心爭取勝利。這一天從早到晚一個整天都很英勇地在戰鬥着。彈藥是費盡了，可是人們幷不退却。</p>
<p>六日晚上八點鐘，米阿哈從陸軍次官的手中收到了一封用火漆密封好的公事，命令他非到七日早上穴點鐘不能開啟。當他打開來看時，却是一個委他爲馬德里防城最高指揮的命令。命令中囑他組織一個委員會。幷取着一切的措施以便撤退軍用品。七日淸早米阿哈卽開始行動，他召集所有的黨派及所有的組織。明白地說明局勢的危急，防城委員會必須在同日下午組織起來。委員會沒有受到一點障礙，便在使這都城的神經爲之震動的戰鬥的喧聲中組織起來了。</p>
<p>當中午米阿哈的一位助手憑倚在月台上面之際，一個新聞記者用着譏諷的口吻向他道：</p>
<p>——甚麽，在找尋道路是不是：</p>
<p>那位軍人扳起面孔很嚴肅的答：</p>
<p>——不，我們不跑，我們要死在我們的位岡上…隨後，他再嘲笑地答道：</p>
<p>——我條在這里是來看是否已能看到摩爾的騎兵—在下午成立了防城委員會。當大家稍爲檢査一下局勢的時候，不禁那愕然起來。防守馬德里的軍實，只有一百箱步槍子彈，支持三貼鐘開火的大砲彈，七架在修理的機關槍，這就是所有的一切。辛於軍隊，亦只有六個已失了戰鬥意志不斷向後退却的縱隊，可是並沒有一個人動搖，也沒有一個震驚。一個一致的决定是：</p>
<p>—我們抗戰到底—</p>
<p>在蒲爾奇斯，在抹耶多里，在沙曼拉加快樂是很大的，馬德里的陷落再沒有誰加以懷疑，佛蘭哥說：</p>
<p>——找們用不到花費一粒子彈就可以進入馬德里去了……</p>
<p>摩拉確證了「總司令」的句子道：</p>
<p>——進取馬德里將不過只是一個簡單的軍事散步……</p>
<p>外國的軍事專家們也同機的這樣看法。在巴黎，在羅馬，在柏林，在倫敦，所有法西斯的報紙都預備好了大號字的標題，以便將叛軍的勝利宣告於世上。</p>
<p>在力加諾斯，在拉伊耶諾的主持之下，已召集了馬德里未來的市府職員開會。在摩斯多力期更集合了好多旅行隊伍，以便帶領法西斯的要人們出席於進城的觀禮。佛蘭哥命令他的臣民及官吏穿起節日慶祝的衣服，摩爾兵歡狂地在遙嗅着馬德里的女人們的新鮮的肉體在發笑……。</p>
<p>佛蘭哥滿心歡喜傲慢地對着一班外國記者們說：</p>
<p>——馬德里已在我們的手中了。所有高地都已受我們控制，已經沒有防守的可能了。假使懂得軍事學識的話，必定不去嘗試這種無用的抵抗的……</p>
<p>可是馬德里的工人們却在笑那專門的學識。他們决定爭取一個勝利，拿看步槍拿着手槍，拿着獵槍，拿着手榴彈向着那些掩壁奔去。他們到死不退後一步，那法西斯主義使也無從通過來了……</p>
<p>在阿爾巴拉辛有三个CNT的會員。他們都是在蘇摩西也拉及在格力多斯身經百戰的勇士。隸屬於著名的摩刺，斐力，奧洛望，費爾蘭特斯以及，自由的靑年團各大嫁。他們的領袖都是鋼鐵的堅强人物，例如，西蒲里亞諾，梅拉，加洛斯及戞色畢呵。散斯，抹伊厄，阿力那斯，多民格，格曼……</p>
<p>七日得到馬德里的壞消息後，梅拉卽召集他的人們並對他們說：</p>
<p>——馬德里已經在危險中了。我們應該去拯救它。可是誰都不要存着幻想，這囘去我們是去死的。誰願意去的，就踏前一步吧……</p>
<p>三千人沒有一個猶預，大家都回前踏進了一步。梅拉高興地微笑着。他再沒有旁的希求了。可是他得再說話來通知他們：　（未完）</p>
<h3>漫談牆頭小說</h3>
<p>— 巴彥</p>
<p>牆頭小說的盛行，也不過最近二三年的事，記得自『八一三』上海抗戰發動以後，郭沬若先生等主辦的「救亡日報」「曾刊載了不少牆頭小說。而在蘆　橋事件未發生以前，江蘇省黨部特派員周厚鈞先生創辦的「蘇報」的文藝副刊「甘露」里，每天登載的一兩篇的千字左右的小說，內容，形式，取材，都非常的惹人注目，這些都可歸納爲牆頭小說。</p>
<p>牆頭小說是特殊的精悍短小的文藝作品，與萬字左右的短篇小晚或洋洋數十萬言的畏篇巨作，同爲大衆的精神食糧。在某種情况之下，牆頭小說的「潛移默化」的功效，較之後者更有動人的力量。</p>
<p>曾有人反對過寫作牆頭小說的，這種短小的過於「露骨化」的沒有含蓄力的東西太不嚴謹，工切，細緻，似乎缺乏文藝的價値，這種論調我是要投反對票的。爲適合大衆的知識程度的水準，閱讀的能力，我覺得牆頭小說不但要提倡，而且遼需要有個普遍的擴展。</p>
<p>牆頭小說是『大衆文學』中的一個部門，它對於大衆，就好比三個銅板一個的燒餅和油條，——任何人都吃得起，都可以常常的吃。它只有一二千字左右。內容形式都切實，通俗；淺顯，故事又富有「感化」和「警惕」的力量。只要組織文字，誰都能讀，能了解，而且只要化三五分鐘的時間就可以看完一　小說，眞是再經濟沒有。</p>
<p>牆頭小說的效用不僅是警惕大衆，激勵大衆，而且還負有敎育大衆的使命。所以在寫作的時候就得要愼重其事，切實注意，細心推敲：應當尋找什麽材料，才能膾灸人口，在大衆的心靈上激起一點不平的浪花？應當如何地描寫，才能使大衆讀了不感到枯燥平凡，而覺得簡鍊生動？應當怎樣佈局，節省篇幅，經濟地寫出一個完整無缺的故事和具體的刻出幾個其中的典型人物？</p>
<p>這裏，別看輕寫作牆頭小說是一件容易的事，如果我們不能和大衆的生活接近，則各階層的狀况就無從明瞭，寫出來一篇牆頭小說有時會非驢非馬，惹人笑話。</p>
<p>好的牆頭小說，我以爲一定要具有下面的幾個條件：（一）字數短少，故事完整無缺。（二）描寫簡捷，人物刻劃得逼眞。（三）對話流利，精　，富有感化力和誘導力。（四）作品意識很正確。（五）取材有時間性，新鮮醒目。（六）從作品里找出一句有力的話或是一個特別的動作爲題目，俾使大衆容易體會領悟。（七）「人」與「事」能在一篇里同時描寫叙述最好。（八）字句須通俗淺顯。</p>
<p>上面舉出八個條件；爲寫作牆頭小說者所應注意。自然，在不斷的寫作過程中，一定會有更多的發現，可作爲新理論上的收穫。</p>
<h3>到南路去</h3>
<p>— 袁鑑明</p>
<p>我們——第四戰區民衆動員會戰時工作隊，爲了要到淪陷區域展開第二期抗戰的工作；向九江進發，經爛石，樂從，壩甲，龍山等。沿途鄕村刁斗森嚴的氣象，興奮着每一個過路人的心，我們穿揷在這些鄉村中間，看見民衆們嚴肅緊張的面孔，表現出來的英勇姿態，心裏想，如果敵人來犯時確能步步為營，處處邀擊。</p>
<p>跑了九十甩，達到九江，我們擬在這裏開展工作，可是一會兒我們接到委員會一道命令，說要開起南路去工作，於是我們便轉了方向，和九江別分了。</p>
<p>沿途經過　勞，三洲等地，現已淪陷了，再經高明轉高要而入肇慶城。</p>
<p>肇慶瀕西江北岸，左廣州，右蒼梧，扼西江的津途，當兩粤的腰臂，爲軍事上必爭之地，東有羚羊峽，兩岸峻峯疊嶺，不絕連綿達數百里，江流勢如　馬，形勢險要，我們想敵人無厭的張着血盆大口，瘋狂的在夢想着，倂呑整憫中國，誰敢料定這里不會變成一個戰場呢？爲了生存，爲了正義，這兒成千成萬的中華兒女會挺立起來準備用熱血洒遍山頭。</p>
<p>肇慶城內，死寂得像刦後的廢墟，商店亦多已關閉，人口減少，頓成戰時狀態，街上所　着除了我們工作團體和英勇武裝戰士外，別無什麽……</p>
<p>爲了　程的緣故，不能不踏上我們的征程，坐了六個鐘頭的帆船，到了三都，時已深夜，再步行，星夜沿雲都公路釗雲浮；沿途沒有什麼，祗見漆黑的天空，和高掛着幾粒的孤星，並有虫聲和流水聲混成一片，還有遠遠來着幾隻閃閃光的螢火，好像照耀着一條光明大道給我們前進，跑了七個鐘頭，方抵雲浮城了。這天恰逢敵機向非武裝區域雲浮城大肆　炸，我們同志們幾乎遭難。</p>
<p>第二天，我們又向羅定進發，跑了一天，到了安鎭市，這段路雖然把腿部都跑壞了。可是爲了爭取民族的自由解放，我們把自巳安排在這艱苦的生活里，不能不要日夜趕程。</p>
<p>離開羅定城到高州府信宜縣有二百多里，費了兩天時間，沿羅信公路經太平墟、合水、白石等小村鎭，沿途十分崎嶇，崇山峻嶺，大霧濛濛籠罩着整個的天空，汽車不能駛過，很容易翻下山脚去，俯視田疇阡陌，縱橫交錯，可是山丘總是光秃的，滿目貧瘠荒凉景象。</p>
<p>從信宜到茂名，有七八十里，可是沒有汽車坐，需要步行，沿途高唱着救亡歌曲，宏壯的歌聲，驅除了疲倦，引導着我們奔向前方，這歌聲喚醒了城鎭，震顫了幽靜的山林。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>在他聽到她的嘆息以後，他感到一種沒有理由可以解釋的難責，加於自己。他重新給她遮起了衣領，遺就是滅輕着自己的，那種難貴的安慰，强者難於屈服暴徒，反而被弱者易於軟化，這時候他就是這樣表現的。他有些自責係問着她：</p>
<p>「你不安心嗎？」</p>
<p>『不要問我！』</p>
<p>這囘答，雖然是反抗的調子，但是聽來，却是非常勉强的聲音——弱者一刹那的頑強的性格。他想了一下，又問她：</p>
<p>『你恨我嗎？』</p>
<p>『你想呢？』</p>
<p>『我想你恨我，可是你不該！』</p>
<p>『哼，不該！你不該做一個土匪！你這樣年　的人，又像是讀過書的；世上生活的道路不是很多的嗎？爲什麽一定要幹這損人利己的勾當，哼，一不小心……那就後悔　了！』</p>
<p>這像一個無知的老人在敎訓自己不肖的兒女的那般誠心；雖然，那般幼稚。他聽了，幾乎笑了。因此，他向她詳談了這事件的主因，經過和預測的結果。在他說話的時候，好像一個政治宣傳家圖煽動說服一個羣衆。最後，他間她：</p>
<p>『你不相信我是義勇軍嗎？』</p>
<p>她相信了。但是，她對匪賊原有的惡感，立刻移到義勇軍的身上，並且，她追悔着自己以往對於他們的盼待，幫助和父親的責罵。</p>
<p>『你反對嗎？』</p>
<p>『反對，反對，一百個反對！」</p>
<p>她那小小的心田，已經被撒滿了仇恨的種子，卽便他送她以消仇的藥粒，怕是也無一滴縫隙容留，縱然容留，也必變質。</p>
<p>在她手無意地觸到衣袋里的尖刀的時候，地帶着那仇恨的種于，又生起了復仇的嫩苗。　（廿二）</p>

<h3>Current War Situation and Its Future</h3>
<p>In the past few days, the military situation on the front lines of the war against Japan has once again become tense and severe. While there have been no major changes on the northern battlefield, the situations in Central and Southern China have attracted widespread attention from both Chinese and foreign observers. In particular, following the fall of Nanchang, those concerned about the future of the war cannot help but worry about the fate of Changsha and the entire Yuehan Railway line. Moreover, at a time when the war in Jiangxi and Hunan is critical, the Japanese-backed forces in northern and southern Guangdong are showing signs of unrest. Rumors have emerged in the Yingde area of northern Guangdong, and the situation in Jiangmen and Zhongshan is extremely serious. We must re-analyze the overall war situation and seek necessary countermeasures.</p>
<p>Recently, Hitler's acts of intimidation in Europe have drawn the attention of peaceful nations such as Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to the European continent. In the eyes of Japanese aggressors, this is the best opportunity to launch new military adventures against China. The unrest around Nanchang is the first step in the Japanese aggressors' new offensive against China. Considering that Japan has recently been doing its utmost to promote the "anti-communist" agreement between Germany and Italy into a military alliance, intensifying its collusion with Germany and Italy, while also condescending to the Soviet Union for the second time to avoid expanding fishery disputes, it is clear that they are determined to intensify their military adventures and implement an offensive to "subjugate China." The decision to make the "Nanchang campaign" the first step is based on the following intentions: First, by occupying Nanchang, the Japanese can proceed more smoothly with all future military operations, and the connection between China's southeastern provinces and the western resistance base will be in danger of being severed. Second, by occupying Nanchang, the Japanese can strengthen their control over the occupied areas in East China and intensify the connection between the occupied areas in Central and North China. Third, the Japanese can use this as a further step to advance westward into Hubei and Hunan, pressuring Changsha, opening up the Yuehan Railway, responding to the Japanese forces in the Guangdong Sea from the south, and threatening our Yunnan and Guangxi provinces in a coordinated westward offensive. These are the motives behind Japan's launching of new military adventures.</p>
<p>In order to implement the "Nanchang campaign," the Japanese first intensified their offensive against western Hubei, repeatedly attempting to cross the Xiang River, creating a menacing posture in an attempt to contain our heavy troops and cover the activities of their troops in Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan. Subsequently, they began a joint naval and air threat, harassing the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, and concentrating their main forces from Hangzhou to force a crossing of the Qiantang River, attempting to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and contain our troops on the eastern front, in coordination with the "Nanchang campaign." Finally, they launched an offensive on both sides of Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi, especially on both sides of the Nanxun Road on the west bank. On the 19th, they forcibly occupied Yongxiu, on the 20th, they forcibly crossed the Xiushui River, and on the 23rd, they crossed Anyi and Fengxin, advancing to encircle Nanchang. After a fierce and unprecedented battle, our troops shifted their front lines according to a pre-determined strategy. The defending troops, however, vowed to coexist or perish with the city, engaging in street battles that have continued for several days. After the "successful" "Nanchang campaign," the Japanese forces advanced towards Wuning, claiming they would attack Changsha and open up the entire Yuehan Railway line, while launching an offensive in northern Guangdong, creating a situation of remote coordination with the Xiang-Gan battle from the southern route of the Yuehan Railway. At the same time, Japanese planes and warships launched large-scale harassment of Beihai and pressed towards southern Guangdong. This is an overview of Japan's new military adventures against China.</p>
<p>Analyzing the actual situation of the current battles in the north and south, we should at least have the following basic understandings:</p>
<p>First, regarding the Nanchang battle, on the surface, the Japanese forces have once again achieved "victory" because Nanchang is the only remaining important city in our Jiangnan region. Now that Nanchang has fallen, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been cut off, and the connection between the southeastern battlefield and the western base area has suffered greater difficulties. Conversely, after the Japanese forces forcibly occupied Nanchang; if they can further complete their connection with the Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei areas, they can advance to Changsha, cut off the Yuehan Railway, and consolidate the occupied areas in the southeast to engage in "mopping-up" operations in preparation for further aggression. However, in reality, with the withdrawal of troops from Nanchang, we still maintain our entire main force, and the first attempt of the Japanese Nanchang campaign has failed. Although the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been temporarily cut off, most of the other roads have been completed; and because we have preserved our main force, we have now begun a counter-offensive; thus, the second attempt of the Japanese Nanchang campaign has also failed. And we still have a large number of regular and guerrilla forces in the border areas of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Currently, we have launched a counter-offensive, and the third attempt of the Japanese Nanchang campaign to advance on Changsha will also encounter major difficulties. At the same time, in this Nanchang campaign, the Japanese are still forced to fight a war for cities and transportation lines. Although they forcibly occupied Nanchang, the elite troops they mobilized in Central China have been sporadically intercepted, resisted, or surrounded by us. They have not only failed to complete their planned Nanchang campaign but have also put the troops in Central China in greater difficulties. Conversely, we have maintained our entire main force, can maneuver freely, and can strike the Japanese at any time; now we have launched counter-offensives in the border areas of Hubei and Hunan and in Qingyang and Tongling in southern Anhui, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army's rear and flanks. It can be asserted that the Japanese army in Central China will face greater difficulties in advancing its plans.</p>
<p>Secondly, the war situation in South China is something we should not ignore at present. Because the Nanchang campaign is only the first step in the Japanese army's new offensive, although the occupation of Nanchang is harmful to the Japanese army, it has a considerable stimulating effect on its increasingly declining morale on the surface. Therefore, this offensive will inevitably shift to the South China battlefield. Moreover, in the eyes of the Japanese, the southwest is the last base of our protracted resistance and the location of our most important international thoroughfare, and their preparations for invasion will inevitably become more intense in the future. Currently, the war situation in northern Guangdong has once again become tense. The Japanese forces in the North River and the southern route of the Yuehan Railway have greatly increased and have advanced north along the railway line, creating a situation of containing the Xiang-Gan front line. In southern Guangdong, Japanese planes and warships have been harassing Beihai for days; at the same time, Rongqi and Guizhou have fallen, and Japanese warships have sailed to Yinggezui, and the situation in Jiangmen is extremely serious, and Zhongshan Shiqi is also in distress. Their intention is obviously the same as the Nanchang campaign. The main purpose is to break the stalemate in the military aggression against China in the past five months, to boost their declining morale, and to prevent our large-scale counter-offensive, consolidate their control of the occupied areas, and facilitate the pro-Japanese elements and traitors to realize the conspiracy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" under the slogan of "anti-communism and peace," and further actively promote their strategy in the southwest. Now, under unified leadership, the military resistance in South China is advancing politically and militarily at the same time, and it will surely be able to strike a powerful blow against the Japanese's conspiracy.</p>
<p>Finally, looking at the overall war situation, the Japanese army has indeed spared no effort to exert its limited combat power to the highest degree and implement steps for military adventures against China. However, first, the more the Japanese exert their combat power to the highest degree, the weaker their strength will become in the future, as can be seen from the time intervals between the fall of Xuzhou, Wuhan, and Nanchang; second, the difficulties within Japan and within the army are developing and doubling along with the new offensive, as can be seen from the fact that the Japanese army lost its sharp edge and could not be lifted again after the fall of Nanchang; third, although this Nanchang campaign and the unrest in southern Guangdong are menacing and highly adventurous, they are all degenerative in their operations and have their passivity, that is, they are all mainly aimed at consolidating their occupied areas. In response to these characteristics, our current countermeasures; in the military, we must strive to enhance the combat power of the front lines, expand guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, stop the Japanese offensive, and promote the second stage of the war of resistance, the stalemate stage, first by using a large number of mobile corps to support southern Anhui, northern Jiangxi, western Zhejiang, and the provinces, and develop guerrilla warfare in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the border areas of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, and the entire province of Guangdong, to stop the movement of the Japanese army and split and annihilate them. And politically, we must promptly crush all traitorous, pro-Japanese elements, defeatist "peace compromise" arguments, and the resurgence of all pessimistic and despairing sentiments. Because the Japanese are using the false victory they have gained from their desperate gamble to deceive their people and induce us to surrender, we must intensify our vigilance. However, to break all the political conspiracies of traitors cooperating with the military, we must also do our best to promote the progress of our own politics, mainly the establishment of local public opinion organs, to realize the total mobilization of national power, and to guarantee the smooth progress of military resistance by consolidating and expanding the anti-Japanese forces and anti-Japanese governments. Japan's new military adventures against China have begun, and we must immediately give them a head-on blow with the facts of military and political progress.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army on the Eastern Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhen</p>
<p>A Letter from Ms. Smedley, Translated from "The China Weekly Review"</p>
<p>I (Ms. Smedley referring to herself, hereinafter the same) do not intend to write a thesis on the large-scale massacres, looting, and ×××× committed by the Japanese army in China since the invasion of China, but I would like to express some opinions and provide some facts on the articles published in The China Weekly Review in the past few months regarding the above facts. The Japanese army's actions in China are indeed numbing to see, and people of any country cannot imagine these events are true unless they witness them with their own eyes.</p>
<p>In your The China Weekly Review, Vol. 29, No. 12 of October 22, you again raised such a question, pointing out how Japan has completely conscripted prisoners in prisons to fight in China, and whether this can be regarded as an explanation for the Japanese army's actions?</p>
<p>No, you are wrong. The fact is not like this; even if all the prisoners in Japan are formed into a technical army, they still cannot be held responsible for all the actions of the Japanese army; first, their number is not large, and they are not completely concentrated in the same system of troops; second, those prisoners are not real criminals. Now most of the criminals are neither murderers nor due to their nature. Many criminals are due to poverty, and in Japan, there are many political prisoners——many people who oppose the current reactionary social and political system in Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's real murderers, real criminals, are never in prison, but hold important positions in the government and the army, navy, and air force. They maintain their inherent traditions with their cruel and feudal mentality. They are the real criminals and are really responsible for condoning the Japanese army's actions in China. In fact, we have ample evidence to prove that the senior Japanese officers are deliberately condoning their soldiers, and if they don't, this war cannot continue, because most of the Japanese soldiers are worried about their poor families all day long!</p>
<p>The leaders of the Japanese army condone their soldiers to act arbitrarily in the occupied cities as a reward for the soldiers; not only that, but many officers also lead soldiers to set fires, plunder, rape, and slaughter civilians. The Japanese authorities in Nanjing even forced each soldier to personally slaughter prisoners.</p>
<p>If you have read those letters and diaries obtained from Japanese prisoners, especially diaries, you can understand their frequent actions. The author of these diaries was originally just a commoner from an ordinary family. After coming to China to fight, he went to those brothels, which the Japanese called "Imperial Army Recreation Clubs." In many diaries, the transformation of those ordinary people at first can be seen, and then their drunken madness can be explored. ……</p>
<p>In several diaries, it is recorded that senior officers ordered them to slaughter the entire village population. I remember a Japanese diary, which I once translated into English, written by Corporal Nakamura (killed by the New Fourth Army near Maling Pass, southwest of Nanjing, on the morning of October 1, 1938). It records that when the Japanese replacements first saw the abuse of Chinese civilian prisoners, their expressions changed. Corporal Nakamura simply and clearly said that those replacements were inexperienced and needed to be well-trained. The corporal also recorded that he and his companions attacked a village in Luokou Town, where they spent two hours hunting for women. His companions also killed a captured woman, "because it was the first time he caught one, and she was so ugly! The rest of us laughed at him." In the same diary, it is also recorded how three Chinese civilians were captured, severely tortured until they went mad, and then killed. Later in the diary, there is another record of a drunken riot. The corporal also wrote in the diary: "Many girls have been conscripted from the entertainment department. It would be wonderful if one could sing and play like that all day long!"</p>
<p>Before coming to China, Corporal Nakamura was an upright civilian. After coming to China, his officer turned him into a cruel person. This is not to defend him, and he was also killed by Chinese soldiers. We must study his diary and other things. Human beings must never seek satisfaction in massacre, arson, and rape unless they become beasts. We must treat these kinds of actions appropriately.</p>
<p>I remember that The China Weekly Review once published an article "The Situation in Suzhou," in which the anonymous author said: "Currently, there are not many cases of Japanese troops ravaging Chinese women. They only seek satisfaction from Chinese prostitutes." I strongly deny this. As far as the New Fourth Army, where I am currently working, is concerned, when they were fighting in the Nanjing-Zhenjiang area, it proved that every time the Japanese army obtained a place, they either killed or hunted for women everywhere. In mid-August 1938, the New Fourth Army recovered a village, where the puppet organization—the Maintenance Association—was preparing to welcome a garrison sent by the Japanese side. At that time, there were about two hundred strong men and some ignorant "self-defense corps" guarding it. The New Fourth Army occupied the entire Maintenance Association, disarmed the "self-defense corps," and arrested their officers, taking all the puppet personnel and the "self-defense corps" officers out for public trial. Those who were found guilty were immediately executed on the spot. Among those witnesses at the time, there were about thirty girls and young women—the wives of the villagers—who were imprisoned by the local puppets to please the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is unbelievable to say that the Japanese army only conscripts Chinese prostitutes. Even all the prostitutes in China are not enough to supply the needs of the Japanese army in the Hongkou district of Shanghai. Most of the women in the "Imperial Army Club" are looted from all sides. When I was in Hankou (referring to the time before Hankou was lost), a Chinese lawyer brought his mad wife from Shanghai to Hankou. Because his wife had been captured and taken to a brothel in Hongkou, he spent several Japanese friends in Hongkou looking for her for several weeks before finding her, and spent 10,000 yuan in bribes to rescue her.</p>
<p>Here is another example. At the end of August 1938, thirty members of the New Fourth Army set out to investigate Xinfeng on the Jinghu Road and saw about fifty Japanese troops stationed at the station. There were ten Chinese girls kidnapped from the town at the station. On the night of September 1, the New Fourth Army attacked the station with grenades. At first, the Japanese army responded with machine guns, and then retreated to the upper floor and guarded the girls. In the end, there was no other way but to burn down the entire station. The New Fourth Army did this. What other way was there to eliminate these fifty villains?</p>
<p>Never believe it when someone is now covering up the actions of the Japanese army. This is completely unreliable. All the misfortunes that Chinese women are currently suffering will inevitably be added to the women of other countries if the Japanese warlords win the invasion of China.</p>
<p>Of course, I agree with you when you say that Americans often do not believe these facts because they cannot imagine the actions of the Japanese army in China. The average American likes a happy ending and does not want to suffer any stimulation. You may doubt the photos taken before the Japanese army's actions, but this is not the case. Many photos are secretly taken by Chinese employees in Japanese stores. Here, the New Fourth Army has many spoils of war, including complete travel cameras and photo albums, which seem to belong to the officers because the officers took many posed photos, and the other photos were divided into dozens of copies and sent to the rear, either by themselves or for sale. Most of these photos are scenes of the Japanese army massacring Chinese civilians, and often a few small photos tell us the whole scene of the facts. The patterns on the photos are: the victims and the Japanese army, the civilians kneeling on the ground to be executed, their heads and bodies separated, and the Japanese army standing proudly with bloody blades.</p>
<p>These photos were not secretly hidden by the Japanese army, and can even be bought in every Japanese occupied area, because the Japanese army regards these photos as a source of pride! In the headquarters of the New Fourth Army, there are also hundreds of letters obtained from battles, some from the hometowns of the Japanese soldiers, and some from their friends and sisters. When they received those photos, a sister said in a letter to her brother: "When I received the photo you gave me of the Chinese person whose limbs were cut off by you, I felt very uncomfortable. I don't know whether to sympathize with or hate this Chinese person."</p>
<p>I can assert that if there had been cameras at that time, there would have been photos of the massacres and atrocities of Genghis Khan's nomadic army. The development of Japanese culture and spirit is only in the same stage as the nomadic peoples of Genghis Khan hundreds of years ago. Although the former has added some superficial decorations, in fact, Japan's war in China is much more modernized than the barbaric Mongolians at that time, but when the Japanese army walks into a Chinese city or town, their actions are no different from those of the barbaric tribes at that time.</p>
<p>We must not be deceived by Japan's political conspiracy. The reason why the Japanese army in large cities such as Hankou did not commit violence like other places is to prevent their atrocities in China from spreading, and the boycott of Japanese goods and the Japanese government's failure to obtain loans from Britain and the United States are the origin of these political conspiracies. But their nature has not changed at all. They have only temporarily disguised their image to the world until they obtain the funds to continue to conquer China. The reason for Japan's political conspiracy is to induce Wang Jingwei and his party to betray their motherland.</p>
<p>As a reader of your publication (referring to The China Weekly Review), I would like to ask you to publish all the photos you have of the Japanese army's massacres, arson, and ravaging of women in China. Other magazines may hesitate, but I believe your publication has the courage. Even if Chinese women can endure the suffering imposed on them, we foreigners should oppose it. Hiding these photos is protecting Japanese imperialism. We must show every aspect of the Japanese army's actions in China to the people of the world. This is not to move Germany and Italy because their past and present actions are the same as Japan's, although the former has not revealed their actions in photos. Japan, Germany, and Italy are no different. They are the world's wanton bullies—this is what we see as fascism—fascism that is returning to barbarism!</p>
<p>Everything we see in China today will be seen in other countries tomorrow! Japan only wants to use China as a base for its continued aggression against all of Asia and the world!</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Eastern Zhejiang War Zone</h3>
<p>— Written by Donald M. Davies, Translated by Huang Jianbin</p>
<p>—— A Foreign Correspondent's Report</p>
<p>The author of this article, Davies, was born in China, speaks fluent Chinese, and is a correspondent for the "American United Press." He has traveled extensively in the interior of China, resided in Chongqing for several months, and recently entered the guerrilla area near Hangzhou. After a short trip in the vanguard area of the Japanese army, he wrote this article. Recently, troops have been deployed and generals transferred near Hangzhou Bay and the Qiantang River, and the situation in Eastern Zhejiang is tense. This article reports on the current situation in the area in great detail, and the situation can be seen at a glance. Davies has now departed from Shanghai for the United States, planning to travel through the Philippines, India, and Palestine.</p>
<p>Eighty thousand farmers and ten thousand organized guerrillas along the Zhejiang coast, along with a smaller force of disguised regular troops, have all been armed and are resisting Japan, thanks to a large supply of military equipment near Shaoxing.</p>
<p>The tactics of these troops are the same as those used by the famous Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army. The latter is a communist organization, but the Zhejiang troops have no such affiliation. A small number are members of the Kuomintang, and the rest are all non-partisan.</p>
<p>Their mission is to sabotage transportation lines, attack garrison strongholds, and steal food and military supplies. The following are two reliable examples:</p>
<p>One recent night, a guerrilla force gathered on the south bank of the Qiantang River. After crossing the river, they ambushed themselves in a bamboo forest near the center of the Japanese garrison, waiting quietly for dawn. Their ambush site was only two hundred meters from the Japanese parade ground. The invaders came out for morning exercises, and then they laid down their weapons and gathered to listen to the officers' lectures on how to defeat the Chinese army. At this time, the guerrillas became impatient and concentrated their fire, with machine guns and rifles firing in unison, killing the imperial army miserably. As a result, the Japanese army lost a hundred men killed and many wounded. The Chinese, on the other hand, had fewer than twenty casualties.</p>
<p>American newspapers reported that many vehicles loaded with arrogant, wounded soldiers of the Imperial Army were being transported back to Shanghai, and admitted that the campaign was due to the Chinese army's attempt to retake Hangzhou. Japanese reports, however, insisted that the Chinese army's attack had failed and suffered serious damage.</p>
<p>These defenders active in Hangzhou, like defenders elsewhere, are sure to prevail as long as they are in a favorable environment. With the risk of a small number of people, they have completely reversed the three-to-one Sino-Japanese loss ratio, which is beneficial to China.</p>
<p>The Chinese, using their wisdom, did another terrifying deed. A hundred Japanese cavalrymen were heading from one garrison in Hangzhou to another. The entire guerrilla force lay in ambush behind the tomb mounds, waiting for the enemy to pass through the selected favorable terrain. The fighters' machine guns roared once again. The cavalry, caught completely unprepared, fell into chaos, rolled off their horses, hid behind them for cover, and those who escaped ran away. Those who remained were forced into a fierce hand-to-hand combat, with casualties on both sides. As a result, China again earned a victory and captured many military supplies. The above two incidents were all told to me by a guerrilla captain stationed near a city near Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Railway workers in the occupied areas, who used to carefully protect the tracks and strive for safe travel, have now all joined the guerrillas to dismantle the tracks. Children also participate, taking on propaganda, fundraising, and guard duties. Two small teams have been established, one is the Young Pioneer Model Group, and the other is the Young Girl Model Group. The former has a hundred members, and the latter has forty. A women's volunteer group organized by twenty people was rejected due to insufficient physical strength. Most of the women are students. They have abandoned their schools and left a city southwest of Hangzhou close to the war zone to go to the front lines to defend their country.</p>
<p>Another youth organization is the Boy Scouts, who are responsible for collecting scrap iron, donations, military rations, and various other tasks. There are also many students who serve in political training and propaganda work.</p>
<p>Tactics have certainly been used successfully. After occupying northern Zhejiang for a year, the Japanese army has only gained eleven counties, which are insignificant (there are a total of seventy-five counties in the province).</p>
<p>The anti-Japanese sentiment in the entire province is indeed high. A certain military officer explained this as the inevitable result of the Japanese army's occupation of a city or town. He said: "The Japanese's brutality and ferocity have forced the people to rise up in resistance." This statement has been confirmed by thousands upon thousands of Chinese.</p>
<p>The guerrillas' food supply seems to be exceptionally abundant. Within the guerrilla area, each bag of rice is only worth eight or nine yuan, while it costs no less than twelve yuan in Shaoxing. Farmers and citizens alike hide rice in the wilderness and hang it on large trees to supply the guerrillas. The Japanese army rarely leaves the camp. Because it is a risky thing, even if they occasionally go out, they dare not stop and search, fearing that a sudden attack will come out of nowhere. But the local troops can take whatever they want without fear. Pigs and chickens can be purchased at reasonable prices. It is said that people in the city send canned food to the guerrillas every dawn as a reward for defending their hometowns.</p>
<p>The guerrillas I saw were mostly well-dressed, healthy, and broad-minded, and most were educated. They can not only be responsible for the military affairs of the provincial defense, but also undertake even greater tasks.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are 20,000 Japanese troops in the entire province, including Koreans and Taiwanese. Most are inferior and have low morale. Chinese reports state that most of the Japanese troops are underage youths who have only received minimal training. I cannot absolutely confirm this report. According to more reliable news, the Japanese military equipment can only be classified as second-rate.</p>
<p>Northern Zhejiang is under the jurisdiction of the Third War Zone, which is headed by General Gu Zhutong. I did not have the opportunity to investigate. The provincial defense forces I saw were all organized by Chairman Huang Shaoxiong. They are locals and members of the newly recruited army, mostly from Jiangxi, based on the remnants of the troops who remained in the province after the communist army's "Long March."</p>
<p>There are five training camps in Zhejiang Province, recruiting approximately 16,000 soldiers each month. The training period is three months.</p>
<p>The regular army is composed of former policemen, farmers, and sons of small merchants. Their hometowns have all been formally or actually occupied by the Japanese army. They adopt mobile tactics, and it is not unreasonable to regard them as guerrillas. The training course has academic and military subjects. They learn the basics of military strategy, learning deception, and simple guerrilla tactics to attack the enemy.</p>

<h3>One Week of Battle Situation, February 23rd to 29th, Military Affairs Commission Announcement</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 29th] The spokesman of the Military Affairs Commission discussed the battle situation this week (March 23rd to 29th), noting that the fighting in western Zhejiang and northern Jiangxi was particularly fierce. Especially in northern Jiangxi, the enemy forces exhausted their full strength on land, sea, and air, launching fierce offensives against us along multiple routes from last week to this week. Our entire army, under the command of the supreme commander, has been fighting fiercely for days. The heavy losses, deep wounds, and the full exertion of attrition warfare inflicted upon the enemy are unprecedented since the Wuhan defense war. In addition, the other lines were generally characterized by sporadic battles. A summary is provided below:</p>
<p>I. Northern Jiangxi Front</p>
<p>Since the enemy's offensive from Poyang Lake last week against Duchang and Wucheng on both banks was severely defeated and their fierce momentum was blunted, they changed their strategy and divided their forces into</p>
<p>tens of thousands, advancing towards Wuning and Nanchang. When they attacked Wuning, starting from Ruoxi, they split into two routes, one advancing westward and the other invading southward. They were severely defeated by our army, suffering heavy casualties. We also killed several key officers, including the enemy's regimental commander, Xieyan Xiongjiangdao, and the Xiong Brigade Commander, Mu Huan, and others. We successively recovered strategic points such as Danaojian, Jiabailao, Huijia Mountain, Wangrennao, Jinji Mountain, Fenghuangjian, Dongkou, and Luoyin. Our positions remain firm, and we</p>
<p>are still engaged in a stalemate in the northeastern Wuning area, continuing fierce fighting. As for the enemy attacking Nanchang, starting from the afternoon of the 21st, they crossed the river between Yongxiu and Qiujin, launching an offensive. Major battles of unprecedented scale occurred at Gouziling, Xi, Mantou Mountain, Anyi, and Fengxin. Our officers and soldiers braved the enemy's intense poisonous gas, artillery fire, and bombs, engaging in bloody battles. In the Battle of Mantou Mountain, over two thousand enemy soldiers, including the enemy's Fanno regimental commander, were all annihilated. In the Battle of Fengxin, the enemy's Gongqi regimental commander also died in succession. Afterwards, our two armies engaged in fierce battles at Wucheng, Wanjiapu, and Shengmi Street. Another unit of the enemy attempted to harass northeast Gaoan, but was bravely repelled by our forces. Currently, we are engaged in a decisive battle with the enemy near Nanchang, with fierce fighting for control of the area. Enemy forces from Guangzhou are continuously being reinforced from Hainan Island and the West River area and continue to construct fortifications without any other movements. Enemy planes have repeatedly raided Gulao, Yangmei, Sanzhou, Lianzhou, Yingwan, and Sucun, causing little damage to us. The enemy attempting to advance from Fenggang towards Zhiguo was repeatedly hit hard by our attacking troops, suffering heavy casualties, and we captured many spoils of war. The enemy's artillery at Makou has been constantly shelling Jinli in recent days, attempting to cross the river. They were suppressed by our counterattacks. On the 23rd, a combined force of enemy infantry and artillery launched an offensive towards Jiulianfen from Ziyoushengang, engaging in fierce battles with one of our units for several hours. The enemy abandoned over a hundred corpses and retreated along the original route. The enemy in Daliang has suffered heavy casualties from our continuous attacks, causing great panic. Enemy warships at sea have shown signs of stirring in the Beihai and Chaozhou-Shantou areas. On the morning of the 26th, an enemy warship sailed into the vicinity of Beihai and released a smokescreen, but fled after being shelled by our artillery. The same afternoon, over a hundred enemy troops landed in the Chaozhou-Shantou area for harassment and were annihilated by more than half by our garrison. The remaining enemy forces fled back to the ship. Currently, the sea is calm everywhere. On the Subei front, after a fresh force of our troops arrived, they launched a counter-offensive and attacked the enemy's rear lines. The counties of Lianshui, Siyang, and Shuyang have been successively captured by our officers and soldiers in a sweeping manner. The enemy's deputy commander in Yangzhou, Miyakawa, was also killed. Now, while continuing to attack Huai'an, they are also taking advantage of the momentum to advance towards the East China Sea. The enemy has been repeatedly defeated and their momentum has waned. The enemy in Jintan, Jiangnan, and Changxing and Wuxing in western Zhejiang are continuously increasing their forces, claiming they will attack Liyang and Yixing. The enemy in Jintan has twice attempted to harass the north this week. The enemy in Changxing also once attempted to advance towards Meishan and Si'an, but were repelled and fled. The enemy has suffered heavy casualties and is still eager to try again. The enemy advancing from Lunpo, Fuchun River towards Dongzhou was counter-attacked by us on the afternoon of the 23rd, and we immediately recovered Feisheng, crossing the river to pursue them. Another unit of our troops cut off the enemy's rear, and the enemy was attacked from both front and rear, suffering hundreds of casualties. Currently, Zhoujiapu and Lingjiaqiao on the north bank have been successively recovered, and the remaining enemy forces have been completely wiped out. The vanguard is approaching Fuyang and is fiercely attacking the enemy entrenched in Hangzhou. The enemy forces in both places are extremely frightened.</p>
<p>II. Hubei Front</p>
<p>The enemy forces in northern Hubei are frequently engaged in transport and are carrying out replenishment and reorganization without any active movements. The enemy forces in central Hubei, such as Hankou, on the 24th and 25th, under the cover of artillery fire and machine gun fire, attempted to forcibly cross the river near Shayang and Zhangjiachang using dozens of civilian boats and rubber dinghies. They were fiercely bombarded by our artillery, sinking many boats. The enemy suffered over four hundred casualties and returned to Dongjin. At the same time, a unit of our army in Shayang launched a surprise attack across the river, besieging the Duohan area, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy at Caijiaxiang, inflicting extremely heavy casualties on the enemy. As of the 27th, our forces were still engaged in a stalemate with the enemy in the northeastern Duobao area, pressing the attack on the enemy. On the southern front, our forces repeatedly launched fierce offensives against Tongshan, Baini Bridge, Anyang, and Shicheng, as well as the enemy in Wuchang and Qingshan, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. In the Battle of Qingshan, an enemy regimental commander was killed. On the eastern front, our forces captured Xishui County after a bloody battle on the 26th, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. The enemy fled in disarray towards Macheng and was pursued, joining forces with our troops in that area to attack Zhongguan Station. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>III. Henan Front</p>
<p>Over a thousand enemy soldiers, with many artillery pieces, launched an offensive in two routes from Wen County on the 24th, engaging in fierce battles with our army near Zhaoxianji and Liushizhuang, as well as Nanwang Zuolichun. The enemy made little progress. Another unit of our army circled around and attacked the enemy's flanks, cutting off the enemy's rear. The enemy hastily fled eastward. By the time our forces arrived, the remnants of the enemy had been completely wiped out. Over four thousand enemy soldiers occupying Nan Yueti, Mazhuang, Wang, Shuangbing, Yang, and Nanlaizhai were attempting to advance towards Huayuankou. Because our forces launched a courageous counter-offensive and our main force encircled them from the rear, the enemy was attacked from both front and rear and their strength gradually waned. They fled in separate routes, with about a thousand retreating to Kangcun, about three or four hundred retreating to Yuanwu, and about two thousand retreating to Kaifeng. Currently, all those areas have been completely recovered. Our forces in Xinyang Luotuodian and Xinzhi Youhe, after two days and one night of fierce fighting since the 24th, have recovered both Xinzhi and Luotuodian. The remnants of the enemy in Youhe are continuing to be surrounded. In this battle, the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties, representing a significant blow to the enemy in southern Henan in recent months. Currently, our forces in the Xinyang area have formed a encirclement, and the enemy trapped in the isolated city and stubbornly resisting will surely be captured in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>IV. Other Fronts</p>
<p>In addition, Fushan, Shanxi Province, after being captured by our forces last week, was reinforced by over three thousand enemy soldiers from Yicheng and Linfen this week. Starting from the 23rd, they launched a large-scale counter-offensive along multiple routes, engaging in extremely fierce battles with our army at Hancun Guanzhi and Xucun. We employed guerrilla tactics and killed many enemy soldiers. The enemy's offensive has been exhausted. In Anhui Province, our army, after capturing Wangjiang last week, launched a counter-offensive on the entire southern bank on the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, they launched attacks in two routes against the enemy in Qingyang and Tongling, making very smooth progress. One route attacked Shun'anzhen (east of Tongling) and has already occupied Yinchiao Village and Guailing. The other route attacked Buling (northwest of Qingyang) and has recovered areas such as Wubushan and Fenghuangshan. In recent days, they have been advancing along separate routes, directly pressing towards the suburbs of Tongling and Qingyang, encircling the enemy.

Our artillery launched a surprise attack on enemy warships sailing on the Yangtze River yesterday, hitting one ship with over twenty rounds, causing it to burn down at the time.</p>

<h3>The Course of the Great Fire in Kunming: An Unprecedented Calamity in Sixteen Years, Property Loss Reaches Tens of Millions of Yunnan Currency</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent, Kunming, Airmail) At about 3 PM on the afternoon of the 24th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out at the east corridor of the Jinri Park outside the Dà Nán Gate of the city, and the corner of Bīnyún Street (formerly Zhūshì Bridge), evolving into an unprecedented calamity in sixteen years (according to investigations, there was a major fire in 1923). Property losses reached approximately tens of millions of Yunnan currency. The course of the calamity and the authorities' subsequent remedial measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Fire Scene: When our reporter heard the news and rushed to the fire scene, from a distance, black smoke filled the sky on the left side of the Dà Nán Gate, and flames soared upward, with tremendous momentum. At that time, the military police had already been dispatched to maintain traffic control at the fire scene. Various fire brigades were rushing to the fire scene to rescue, surrounding the fire scene, either starting up machinery, or transporting water and connecting hoses. The sound of trumpets and whistles was played urgently, urging rescuers to engage in a fierce struggle with the flames. At this time, the storefronts in the east corridor of Jinri Park on Zhèngyì Road, starting from the Xīngguāng Electric Company at the corner of the south entrance of the Xīnshìchǎng, all the way to the storefronts in the north-south and west corridors at the entrance of Shíshàn Street, had been burned. The entrance of Shíshàn Street had been blocked by flames from the north-south and west corridors, making it impossible to enter or exit. In the raging flames, only the eaves, beams, and pillars could be seen collapsing downward. The inside of Jinri Park was filled with goods moved out by various shop owners, resembling hills. The crowds watching the fire, starting from the east at the warning line of Shíshàn Street Qúán Lane, south along the entrance of Tóngrén Street and Yùxī Street on Zhèngyì Road Jinri Park, and west from the entrance of Wànzhōng Street inside the Dà Nán Gate, and the south entrance of the Xīnshìchǎng, was filled with no less than ten thousand people. At about 5 PM, the fire had still not subsided slightly.</p>
<p>Gathering of Important Officials: That day coincided with a meeting of the provincial affairs conference. After hearing the report, Chairman Lóng immediately led the various committee members and department heads to the fire scene and directed the rescue efforts from the Dà Nán Gate tower. At the same time, Military Commander and concurrently Air Defense Commander Yáng Yíqí, Kunming Mayor Zhái Yǔxiān, Provincial Capital Police Chief Yuè Guópíng, Fire Brigade Chief Jiāng Zhīhào, and district heads and other relevant personnel also worked hard to direct the soldiers in the fire scene. In the midst of entering and exiting the fire scene, Chief Jiāng was hit in the left hand by a piece of wood, and soldier Wú Zhēnwén was also seriously injured in the right eyeball by falling tiles. The officers and soldiers of the Guarding Mixed Independent Brigade courageously rescued the roof of Héngfēngxīng, thus Héngfēngxīng was spared from disaster. From 3:40 PM to 6:30 PM, the fire was completely extinguished. The remaining burning beams on the ground were completely cleared by 11 PM that night.</p>
<p>Cause of the Fire: As for the cause of this fire, according to Police Fifth Precinct Chief Tán, the truth has not yet been definitively determined. Currently, only one suspect, Gù Shàolóng, the owner of Hóngxīngshèng, has been taken to the station for questioning. The rest is still under investigation. However, according to general rumors, there are about two causes. One theory is that a carpenter working in the shop of Hóngxīngshèng (also said to be Qìnghuá Paper Shop) was careless when eating lunch, causing wood scraps to catch fire. Unable to extinguish it, he dared not publicize it and secretly fled until the flames burst out and neighbors discovered it and shouted. However, the fire was already raging and spread like wildfire. Another theory is that a power line suddenly broke and fell, causing the paper scraps of the paper shop to catch fire. Currently, Shíshàn Street is being renovated, and most of the owners and goods have been moved elsewhere, leaving only empty houses and carpenters working inside.</p>
<p>Extent of Losses: The losses from this fire were that twenty-six storefronts on Bǎoshàn Street were burned, starting from Róngshènglì at number 123, and ending at Héngshùn Company at number 149, including Zhōngměi Store, Yúnchāng, Mào Company, Rénjì Beijing Goods Store, Yìshēnglì, Xīngshùn, Kǒngxìnjì, Yù, Héngxīng, Shùnxīng, Yúnxīnglóng, Bǎoxīng Company, Hóngxīngchéng, Qìnghuá Paper Shop, Yùnhóngxiáng, Lóng Company, Hóngfā Company, Róngxīng Company, Wéixīnchāng, Xīng Company, Héngshùn Company, etc. On Zhèngyì Road, the burned ones were the nine, starting from the Héngyì Paper Shop, including Sū Yuánchāng, Huá Cosmetics Factory, Xiǎo Lǚsòng Hat Factory, Hòujì Grocery Store, Lǐ Pīzhāng Medical Clinic, Míngchāng, and Xīngguāng Battery Shop. In addition, twenty houses were burned. The total amount of property losses (including the houses) was about ten million Yunnan currency. Among them, the biggest loss was Míngchāng Silk Store.</p>
<p>Taking Remedial Measures After Losing Sheep: The provincial government authorities, in view of the heavy casualties of this fire, were attributed to the imperfection of fire prevention, and at the 618th provincial affairs conference, the chairman proposed a supplementary method for building firewalls. It was passed and resolved, and the original text reads "In the case of the construction of firewalls in the streets of this city, this committee has passed and resolved the method on February 14th this year and issued it for circulation, and it is limited to be completed within one month. According to reports, many of the firewalls built by the citizens are perfunctory and irresponsible. This matter is of great importance and relates to the public security of the province and the locality. It is because of a small number of people who do not understand the truth that they are doing self-deceiving things, which is truly hateful. Also, the detailed methods for this construction of firewalls have been specified and instructed by the Construction Department. Now, another supplementary regulation is added that all city houses with the same beams and common dwellings must have a firewall thickness of two Chinese feet, and its height above the roof ridge must still be three Chinese feet. After this regulation, all unqualified firewalls will be cancelled and rebuilt. In addition, the deadline will be extended by one month, and all must be completed by the end of April. The Construction Department will urge the provincial capital police department to strictly enforce it. Those who exceed the deadline will be questioned by the supervisors. In order to be more serious, starting from next week, the Construction Department will send personnel to start inspection. If there are those who do not comply with the regulations, in addition to a fine, the house occupant will be punished with a ruler to serve as a warning and avoid emulation."

<p>Special Correspondence from Shaoguan</p>
<p>3.  Will the People's Livelihood Improve?</p>
<p>Although the government has clearly ordered the removal of many kinds of donations and taxes, it is not widespread or practical, and the people's lives are still far from the degree of improvement they should have. Because: 1. The people's burden is unreasonable, and it is not really "the rich contribute money, and the strong contribute labor." For example, public debt sales are apportioned, the same for the poor and the rich, and the military and corvée services are often exploited by the Baojia chiefs. Also, the old burdens have not been reduced, and new burdens have come. 3. The people who have been killed have not received considerable relief, and they are often displaced.</p>
<p>4.  Will Corruption Be Eliminated?</p>
<p>Guangdong is said to be rich, and the phenomenon of corruption is particularly appalling. Although it has improved somewhat since the War of Resistance, but: (1) In terms of public debt, strong blackmailing has created many cases of personal gain. For example, the amount of public debt in a certain county was to sell 40,000 yuan, but it increased to 60,000 yuan in the hands of the county magistrate. It goes without saying that the district and township Baojia chiefs exploited it. (2) Regarding the corvée services, the township Baojia chiefs used it to make money. A certain inspector Li in Qujiang exploited the recruitment of laborers to make a fortune in the national crisis, which is a recent fact. (3) There is a phenomenon of false reporting in the donations. (4) Smuggling is even more serious. The fall of Guangzhou is a bloody lesson. (5) Discounts on public sales, especially on the purchase and use of military supplies, in transactions, it is said that once a batch of Tongyi instruments was imported from abroad for only 200,000 yuan, but the receipt wrote 800,000 yuan. (6) The phenomena of deducting pay, swallowing up the number of soldiers, and making false reports, and swallowing public debt funds in the army have not been completely eradicated. (7) Even the lower-level lackeys who go to the countryside to collect taxes also extort tea and handling fees. The reasons for the existence of this corruption phenomenon: Second, public officials lack political education, wear the coat of the War of Resistance, and plan to be promoted and make a fortune; Second, the government has not established a strict inspection system, even if there is a "personal inspection commissioner," it is just a formality, and it has not been properly used to achieve the desired effect; Third, political discipline has not been strictly enforced, so that the phenomenon of eating corruption is treated as a common occurrence; Fourth, the public does not have sufficient opportunities to expose corruption; Fifth, appointing private individuals to collude and do evil, not using people for work, but only for profit and favoritism.

<h3>The Enemy in the Occupied Areas is Increasingly Extorting</h3>
<p>[Xingji, Central News Agency, 28th] The enemy's extortion of our people in the occupied areas is becoming more severe. The enemy pseudo-government in Linjin Yi County has recently ordered the forced collection of land tax and miscellaneous taxes, and plundered food. The people hate them to the bone.</p>
<h3>The British Ambassadors to the Far East Meet, All Parties Pay Great Attention, The Center of External Discussions is No More Than Four Points, The Purpose is to Protect British Interests in China</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Associated Press, 29th] People with good sources of information in the foreign community here told the Associated Press reporter that the discussions between British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Ambassador to China Kerr in Shanghai will cover the following four points: (1) How to defend the Shanghai Public Concession; (2) How to protect British interests in China and how to deal with Japan's anti-British movement in China; (3) How to defend Hong Kong and Kowloon if the European war breaks out; (4) Review the Sino-Japanese war situation and report to the British government for reference in deciding future policies.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Associated Press, 29th] People with good sources of information in this area attach great importance to the meeting between the British Ambassador to Japan and the Ambassador to China and the recent return of the Soviet Ambassador to China, believing that this will be the basis for future diplomatic activities. It is generally believed that Japan's eagerness to seek peace is by no means a step back from China, but rather a desire to take a rest in order to cope with the guerrillas. Although the British side is under pressure due to the tense situation in Europe, it has never forgotten to protect its interests in China. The purpose of the two ambassadors' meeting is to promote the protection of British interests in China. As for the Soviet Union, it has always advocated assisting China, but it is unwilling to violate the strength of the democratic countries and assist alone. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union is still willing to work together with the democratic countries to strengthen its assistance to China.</p>
<h3>The Puppet Government of Hebei is Panic-stricken</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] Tianjin News, After the puppet provincial government of Hebei moved to Baoding, the guerrillas in the vicinity are as active as usual.

<h3>A Report on the Inspection of the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway: The Celestial Ladder Road Has Become a Thing of the Past; Rapid Progress in Construction Makes Roads No Longer Difficult</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 28th] A reporter from the Central News Agency arrived in Chengdu on the 28th, traveling the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway from Baoji, taking nine days in total. After a brief inspection along the way, I deeply felt that the construction of this road has advanced by leaps and bounds. Although there are towering peaks such as the Qinling Mountains, Fengling Mountains, and Bashan Mountains, all over 2,000 meters above sea level, the road surface is flat and wide, allowing for smooth passage. Cars average 30 kilometers per hour. Any small bridge on the entire road can be crossed by vehicles weighing more than three tons. This is a major land transportation line connecting the Southwest and Northwest. Along the way, the means of transporting goods include cars, donkey carts, and manpower, and business is still continuous, truly a scene of busy traffic. The road connects the ancient Qin Lianyun Road and the Jian'ge plank road. The remnants of the plank roads that were built have now disappeared. The danger of the so-called "Celestial Ladder" plank roads and the difficulty of the road have also disappeared accordingly. From Baoji to Chengdu is 700 kilometers. In the 26th year [of the Republic], the right road surface was rebuilt. Now, in the midst of a once-daunting journey, one can see the people chiseling mountains and building bridges everywhere, continuing to work hard on new construction. In just two years, transportation construction has advanced by leaps and bounds. This is indeed a remarkable achievement in our war of resistance and national construction. The inns opened along the way, including the China Travel Service hostel at Zhang Liang Temple, have also opened for business, making travel convenient. Along the way, you can browse the ancient relics of the Han and Wei dynasties, and the famous scenic spots of the Three Kingdoms. Amidst the winding cloud plank roads, there are also the wonders of peach blossoms under the ridge and snow on the ridge. In the tiring long journey, it can be a refreshing experience.</p>

<h3>Britain and France Actively Plan to Promote Military Cooperation; Dignitaries of the Two Countries Frequent Each Other, and It Is Widely Reported That a Military Alliance Has Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently proposed to France, the Soviet Union, and Poland to jointly issue a declaration to resist aggression. France and the Soviet Union have already agreed without reservation, but Poland has refused to participate. The British Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee deliberated on the situation yesterday afternoon. Diplomatic circles immediately claimed that this declaration may be issued jointly by Britain and France.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] At the invitation of French Chief of Staff General Gamelin, British Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant General Gort came to France to visit army exercises and inspect the Maginot Line. He arrived at Le Bourget Airport near Paris at 3:40 PM today, accompanied by many military experts from London.

According to some sources, the British military delegation came to discuss with French military authorities a plan for practical military cooperation between Britain and France to resist future aggression.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th] Military circles here generally say that the nature of the talks between Chief of the General Staff Gort, who went to Paris to hold talks with French military authorities, is very important, especially focusing on the mutual contact between the air force authorities of Britain and France. In addition, French Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac is also scheduled to come to London next week to discuss with British authorities the adjustment of the aircraft manufacturing industries of Britain and France.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 29th] A member of the British Military Senate is currently visiting France. This trip appears to be an inspection of the Maginot Line, but according to reliable sources, the purpose is to study on-site how the British and French armies can best coordinate in the event of war. This trip also indicates that regardless of whether Britain and France can win over Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, and other countries to form an international group to counter Hitler's expansion movement, Britain and France have decided to continue cultivating the foundation of "military cooperation." The scope is not only limited to Western Europe but will extend throughout Europe. Furthermore, British and French officials plan to hold talks for three days to discuss offensive and defensive strategies and to select bases on the Maginot Line suitable for the "Continental Expeditionary Force" of the British army to defend during wartime.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 27th] A diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Mail" here claimed that Britain and France are currently conducting a military alliance and will invite Poland and Romania to jointly participate in the alliance. It will also protect the territorial integrity of the Netherlands and Switzerland. The Soviet Union is currently not included, but it may be invited to participate in the future. At the same time, the "Daily Telegraph" also stated that Britain and France are now urging Romania and Poland to guarantee each other's border security. If the two countries agree to implement this, Britain will provide assistance in four ways: (1) accelerate the manufacturing of armaments for supply; (2) blockade Germany by sea; (3) send strong air force assistance; (4) organize small mechanized units to participate in the war. However, if this new policy is made public, all parties will greatly criticize and unanimously oppose the government if they discover that the Soviet Union is not in the alliance.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced that the House of Commons will meet today to debate British foreign policy. This meeting was determined at the request of Labour Party acting leader Greenwood.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] On Tuesday evening, when Prime Minister Chamberlain was entertained by the St. Stephen's Club, he gave a speech to Conservative members of Parliament, extremely denying the rumors in the outside newspapers that internal disagreements had occurred within the British cabinet due to foreign policy issues. At the same time, the Prime Minister re-explained the political situation during the Munich Conference and said that the British government was in that situation, there was no good way except for this plan. He also said that his recent report to the House of Commons expressed great sympathy for the members, but because the current situation is still under strict discussion to deal with, it is not possible to announce it publicly.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Answers Questions in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today, in response to a question from Labour MP Greenwood, that the government is still continuing to discuss various issues arising from recent events with other countries. During the negotiations, members should pay attention to the confidential nature of the content. Before obtaining the final opinions of the countries concerned, it is difficult to give a definite report to the House of Commons. Greenwood then asked: In order to dispel our concerns, could the Prime Minister explain whether the draft declaration submitted by Britain to the countries concerned for consideration is only for discussion purposes, or does it entail military constraints? Chamberlain replied that, as he had said before, the government has a well-thought-out plan, not just for discussion. But he was not in a position to give a detailed explanation at this time. Chamberlain then answered other questions, saying that the government had made it clear to other governments the extent to which Britain was prepared to cooperate. The House of Commons will meet to discuss this matter at the earliest possible date. The government is deeply aware of the urgent importance of this matter and is eager to reach a conclusion as soon as possible, but it is not just one government that is involved in this matter, and the power of decision is not entirely in the hands of the British government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Chamberlain answered questions in the House of Commons today regarding the qualifications of the representatives of the British Pacific Defense Conference, stating that the government believes that the delegations from various regions were satisfactory. Labour MP Philip asked whether, after the meeting was convened, the situation had greatly changed, and the responsibilities borne by the meeting were more significant than expected. Therefore, regarding the issue of representatives, is there a need to supplement or reassign them to ensure fullness in order to meet the heavy responsibility? Chamberlain replied that this matter had been carefully considered, and the government believed that the current candidates were the most suitable.</p>
<h3>The US President Approves the Construction of Two More Giant Ships; Extends the Validity of Currency;</h3>
<p>New Neutrality Not Applied to the Far East</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] President Roosevelt yesterday approved the Navy Department's addition of two battleships with a displacement of 45,000 tons.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] President Roosevelt's authority to change the gold content of the US dollar, the Exchange Equalization Fund Act, and the Department of the Treasury's purchase of foreign silver at a fixed price will all expire on June 30 this year. The government has submitted a bill to the House of Representatives requesting an extension to June 30, 1941. The Monetary Committee has approved it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Regarding the legislative struggle over the Neutrality Act, there is a new motion today. Senators Nye, Bone, and Clark submitted an amendment on the eve of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting tomorrow, expanding the scope of the "cash and carry" principle so that it can be applied to all foreign-bound goods during wartime, and empowering Congress to decide whether a state of war exists. At the same time, the presidents of 17 national universities and specialized schools in China jointly telegraphed the US Congress, requesting that the positions of aggressors and victims be distinguished, and not to pass the "cash and carry" method, as it would only help Japan's aggression. However, the authorities here believe that most of the goods aiding China are currently transported into China by the Soviet Union and Myanmar, so the "cash and carry" principle will not affect China's war of resistance. At the same time, it is believed that no matter how the Neutrality Act is amended in the future, President Roosevelt will still maintain the old practice and will not apply the new bill to the Far East.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Today, Republican members of the House of Representatives Coinage Committee proposed to abolish the President's power to lower the price of silver and advocated stopping the silver purchasing program. Later, Democratic members, based on a strict party divide, rejected the proposal by a majority of ten votes to seven.</p>

<h3>British Bombing Case Trial Ends; Eight People Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Central Criminal Court here today ended the bombing case that occurred recently. Eight people who were found guilty were punished. Judge Humphrey said, "When a person stops using constitutional methods to change the status of a self-governing territory, and uses terror and arson to cause incidents that harm the lives of law-abiding people, the royal power orders law enforcement officers to take resolute action to suppress such illegal and dangerous acts. These people call themselves patriots. Even if they are patriots, they have committed criminal cases." The first four of the eight were sentenced to 17 years, 15 years, 14 years, and 12 years of imprisonment. Of the other four, two were sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, one was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and one was sentenced to eighteen months of imprisonment.</p>

<h3>The Situation Between Germany and Poland Is Increasingly Tense; The Troops of the Two Countries Are Concentrated Separately; Diplomatic Talks Have Not Yielded Results</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] Marshal Ritz of the Polish Army participated in the meeting convened by the government party. Secretary Kwaskowski gave an impromptu speech, saying that what Poland perceives is the imminent arrival of a major crisis. Secretary Kwaskowski also said that we should work for peace and seek to maintain good relations with our neighbors without being influenced by external pressure. We should not be involved in aggressive plans against our neighbors. For our borders, our honor, and our independence, we must strive for victory until the last breath.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 29th] According to a telegram from Warsaw last night from the "Evening News," Poland has taken emergency military preparations and is on the verge of partial mobilization. 300,000 people were conscripted last week, and 750,000 reservists were mobilized in the previous four days, so the number of mobilized people has exceeded one million. Also, the Polish government is now taking necessary steps to convert all factories for war industries.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Danzig, 29th] It is reported that Polish troops are still continuing to concentrate at the northern end of the Polish Corridor. However, it is generally believed that the German seizure attempt may have withered. Officials believe that if Hitler had such an attempt, he would have held it at the same time when he seized Memel last week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] German Ambassador Moltke visited Colonel Burke, the Polish Foreign Minister, last night. Although it is generally speculated that Burke assured Moltke that the Polish government has no intention of abandoning the principles of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty of 1934 and joining with other countries to oppose Germany, it is heard that their talks did not improve the situation.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 29th] Polish Foreign Minister Burke had a long meeting with German Ambassador Moltke yesterday. It is heard that the content was quite important, and the Polish anti-German movement and German newspapers' anti-Polish propaganda were all discussed. What was the result? This has not been published here, and both Poland and Germany are silent about it.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 29th] The leader of the Polish National Unity Camp, Skarzyński, gave a speech to the leaders of the camp, saying that although the recent changes in the Central European situation were not surprising, they have made Poland's position extremely difficult. However, Poland will continue its past foreign policy, and the non-aggression treaties of Poland, Germany, and Poland and the Soviet Union are the results of these policies. Poland's purpose is to maintain peace in this part of Europe and maintain friendship with its neighbors. Finally, General S. said that Poland will not be subjugated by any external force, nor does it want to invade other countries.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 29th] Political circles here are extremely surprised by the sudden return to the country of Kilrek, the leader of the Polish left-wing opposition party who has been wandering in Czechoslovakia for many years, and Bergenski, and the leader of the Peasants' Progressive Party. It is heard that their return to the country was because they were sentenced to imprisonment for political crimes several years ago, and they fled to Czechoslovakia for several years. Now they have returned home to receive their due punishment.</p>
<h3>German Officials Instructed to Oppose Poland</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Warsaw, 29th] According to reliable sources, a large number of German troops are now concentrating near Danzig. It is generally feared that Germany may take the same steps against Poland as it did against the Czech Republic and Lithuania. According to responsible authorities in Warsaw, the Polish government has sent a note to Germany expressing that negotiations on the future of Danzig should be unnecessary. The note also expressed dissatisfaction with the wording of German official newspapers and newspapers. At the same time, news from Yugoslavia said that the anti-German sentiment and demonstrations of the people there are increasing day by day. Semi-official figures in Berlin stated to foreign visitors, "The Danzig issue must be resolved, and the outbreak of anti-German activities in Poland has shocked Germany." The sudden rise of anti-German propaganda is recognized by all parties as a trick used by Germany. All reports of anti-German activities in Poland are instructed by the German official German News Agency to create tension in German-Polish relations. Although the news agency constantly reports that Germans in Poland and Danzig have been repeatedly attacked, it refuses to publish the locations and times of the incidents. Therefore, this situation is the same as Germany's previous actions against Austria, the Sudetenland, the Czech Republic, and Memel. The official gazette "Political Visitor" warned anti-German elements in Poland that anti-German activities would cause unfortunate consequences, which would cause disasters in Europe and harm Poland itself. This warning, because it came from official instructions, is highly valued by all parties.</p>
<p>[Berlin, 29th] Foreign news, the German Foreign Ministry reported today, "If Poland regards the main rights and honors of the German people as unimportant, it is regrettable that this will have a tacit influence on the harmonious development of the future European situation and Poland itself." This remark is obviously Germany's response to Poland's increasingly close ties with Western powers. German newspapers are now conducting fierce anti-Polish propaganda and condemning the Polish government for pursuing an anti-German policy.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 29th] In the past two days, anti-German incidents have occurred continuously in Bloomberg. Local residents of German nationality are very indignant. Most of the doors of Germanic shops were smeared with tar by rioters, with words such as "Enemies live here." Also, on Tuesday, a Polish merchant in Gdynia, Aktert, flew out a notice stating that he was not German but a patriotic Pole, because the demonstrators mistakenly thought he was German and covered his door with tar. Also, yesterday, the police in Bloomberg arrested two Polish students, who were said to be related to the demonstration.</p>

<h3>Franco's Troops Enter Madrid, Spanish Situation Still Unresolved, Government Officials Arrive in Valencia, Germany and Italy Rejoice, Claiming the War is Over</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Valencia, 29th] It is widely believed that the National Defense Council here is discussing the early entry of Franco's troops into Valencia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] According to news received here, members of the Spanish Republican Army's National Defense Council arrived in Valencia today. They are currently holding a meeting under the chairmanship of General Miaja.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Madrid, 28th] The city of Madrid surrendered to the Nationalist forces at noon on the 28th. The Republican government's Minister of Defense and all cabinet members have left for other destinations. Government troops on the front lines are all flying white flags, and all soldiers are leaving the trenches to take refuge in the city. Nationalist flags are displayed everywhere in the city, and pedestrians are using the Fascist salute. Many residents are trying to flee to the port of Valencia, but due to a shortage of fuel, they cannot use cars and have to leave the city on foot, in a very distressed state.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 28th] The Spanish Civil War, which has lasted nearly three years and caused immense suffering and repeatedly threatened the European situation, is finally coming to an end. Franco's troops have entered Madrid and are carrying out a mop-up operation. Although other cities have not yet formally surrendered or offered terms, resistance is impossible because the people are tired of war. Many soldiers have surrendered in groups, while officers have fled. It is reported that General Miaja has gone to the coast and will take a foreign steamer from Valencia to another destination.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 29th] After Franco's troops entered the city yesterday, they immediately released all political prisoners, many of whom were young members of the Spanish Fascist Party. After their release, they seized flags everywhere and guarded the prisons. Fascist flags and emblems are visible everywhere, and demonstrations are being held. All radio stations of the National Government are broadcasting appeals to the Republican government's troops, urging them to surrender voluntarily to avoid bloodshed. One of the most important messages is: "Please trust in General Franco's impartiality. General Franco always keeps his word and never breaks his promises. Please do not be misled."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 28th] Nationalist planes are constantly flying over Madrid. The first measure taken by the city's new masters after entering the city was to order the staff of all theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment venues to continue working as usual so as not to affect the daily lives of residents. This afternoon, the first batch of Franco's army's relief food trucks arrived in the city, loaded with chocolate, canned food, and fruit, and distributed them to the welcoming people. The university district, which had been occupied by the Nationalist army, had long been occupied by the militia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 28th] Hitler sent a telegram to General Franco today congratulating him on "the final defeat of the Bolshevik ideology that is destroying the country."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 28th] Mussolini appeared on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia today and addressed a crowd of 10,000 people, saying, "General Franco's infantry and Italian volunteers have now entered Madrid. We can recognize that the Spanish Civil War has ended, and communism has been overthrown with it. The enemies of Italy and Fascism have also been destroyed."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 29th] Since the fall of Madrid, the government forces' resistance has been very weak. Franco's troops are advancing towards the Toledo and Cordoba fronts. Towns within the battle lines have either surrendered to Franco's forces or have been occupied by those expressing sympathy for Franco's forces. Trams and underground trains in Madrid are still running. Electricity for lighting and cooking is scarce, and the gas supply has not yet been restored.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 28th] After the news of the Nationalist army's occupation of Madrid reached here, the whole city was decorated with flags to celebrate. Crowds gathered in front of the Palazzo Venezia, cheering and paying tribute to Prime Minister Mussolini. The Prime Minister appeared on the balcony twice to thank the crowd and delivered a brief speech.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] It is believed here that the surrender of Madrid may prompt the United States to recognize the Franco government sooner, but it is generally believed that the government is unlikely to take any action in the near future.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party, Who Knows What Conspiracies They Are Plotting</h3>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Expanding the Battle in the Anti-Japanese Rear Areas</h3>
<p>The main combat task in the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War is to consolidate and expand the battle in the anti-Japanese rear areas. Today's newspaper editorial discusses the recent war situation and specifically points out that one of the main tasks of defeating the Japanese invaders is to consolidate and expand the battle in the anti-Japanese rear areas.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Chongqing on the 28th states that our guerrilla forces have penetrated deep into the four northeastern provinces. The main forces include: 1. The Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army (regular army) with 50,000 soldiers; 2. The Farmers' Self-Defense Corps with 100,000 soldiers; 3. The Twelfth Route Army organized by the Eighth Route Army, operating from Rehe; 4. The Second Route Army reorganized from the Sino-Korean Anti-Japanese Allied Army, operating on the Manchurian-Korean border; 5. The Anti-Japanese Army of the people on the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border, which has fought as many as 321 times in the past two months. Even if their achievements are not counted, these forces have contained a large number of Japanese puppet troops (currently there are 290,000 Japanese Kwantung Army and 150,000 puppet troops outside the pass).</p>
<p>Here, we should not only pay the highest national revolutionary tribute to the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in the four northeastern provinces but also learn from their spirit of sacrificing themselves for the country and fighting hard. We must step up guerrilla warfare in the eastern provinces and Guangdong, stop the Japanese invaders' attacks, and prepare for our army's counter-offensive. Only in this way can we live up to the hard struggle of the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in the Northeast, finally save the nation from destruction, and establish a new, independent, and free China. Our overseas compatriots should especially shoulder this great combat task. Those with skills and expertise should actively prepare to return to the country to participate, and those with material resources and knowledge should provide material and spiritual assistance.</p>

<h3>After Japanese Troops Rampaged Along Our Coast, British Far East Shipping Suffers a Major Blow, Yangtze and Pearl River Business Almost Completely Suspended, Japan Decides to Block Foreign Ships from Sailing on the Pearl River Again</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Far East shipping industry has seen fierce competition from various countries, with new ships being added to the routes. British shipping has always held a leading position, but it has also been adversely affected by competition from various countries. Especially after Japan launched its war of aggression, our coast has suffered greatly, and British shipping has been significantly threatened. After the Yangtze and Pearl River fell to Japanese occupation, British merchant ships stopped sailing one after another, and business has since suffered a severe blow, resulting in huge losses. Recently, in order to find ways to salvage the situation, the British government organized the Imperial Shipping Committee to investigate the actual situation of shipping in the Far East. According to a Western news report from Hong Kong, the committee's report has been published, stating that the threat to British shipping interests in the Far East is increasing day by day, especially the blow from Japan, which is even more significant. Britain should have practical measures to deal with the situation so as not to lose its existing position. The committee also presented measures and requested the government to adopt them, roughly stating that the governments of the British Empire can protect British shipping in three ways: subsidizing shipping companies, reserving trade transportation rights, and allocating transportation. The most important thing is that British merchants in various places must allocate more goods to British ships. Far East trade is extremely important. In 1936, British Far East shipping companies earned 3.3 million pounds, accounting for about a quarter of the world's shipping profits. At present, competition in the Far East shipping industry is becoming increasingly fierce. The German and Italian governments subsidize mail ships to travel to various parts of the Far East. Because the ships are luxuriously equipped and travel quickly, high-quality goods and passengers are attracted to them. Japanese competition and intimidation are even more terrible. The Japanese government's subsidies have enabled its ships to be re-equipped and modernized, but in fact, Japan's use of military power is even more terrible. Britain must protect its shipping in the Far East by proceeding in a proper manner.</p>
<p>According to another foreign news report, reliable sources say that the Pearl River channel will be blocked again by Japan in the short term, refusing passage to all foreign ships. The British shipping service that has been running every two weeks will also be prohibited. Another news report says that the Japanese authorities are considering the issue of prohibiting foreign ships from sailing on the Pearl River and only allowing ships from Japan to sail. Once a decision is made, it will be announced immediately. It is said that this is because Chinese guerrilla forces are unusually active along the Pearl River, and Japanese steamers and armed fishing boats (often attacked by guerrillas) cannot be swept away, so the Japanese have to be strictly vigilant. As a result of negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities in Shamian, the British ship Fo Shan sailed from Hong Kong to Guangzhou yesterday (29th) morning and will sail once every two weeks thereafter. It is noted that this route was originally operated by the Jinshan, but because the Jinshan is undergoing repairs, it is temporarily replaced by the Fo Shan. The Fo Shan only carried a few passengers yesterday and did not carry any cargo. It will stay in Guangzhou for one day and return to Hong Kong on Friday morning.</p>
<h3>A Pitiful Young Woman Commits Suicide by Poison and Then Kills Her Infant Daughter, Liu Shuqing Granted Amnesty by the Governor, She is Nine Months Pregnant and About to Give Birth, Temporarily Placed in Custody, to be Freed After Childbirth</h3>
<p>Liu Shuqing, a 22-year-old woman, was previously charged with suicide and poisoning her 18-month-old daughter, Ruan Meitou. After several hearings by the Central Magistrate, she was sentenced. On January 25 of this year, she was retried by the Chief Justice McGilligan and sentenced to life imprisonment. It has been more than two months since the conviction. The reason for Liu's criminal behavior was entirely due to her circumstances. People in society sympathized with Liu's life and her miserable situation. Liu's experience was truly tragic. Although she poisoned her daughter, it was purely out of sincere maternal love. Therefore, a request was made to lawyer Sayer, asking for assistance in transferring the request to the Governor to grant Liu amnesty. Recently, Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote also felt that the defendant's life was pitiful and that her situation was understandable. He exercised leniency outside the law and raised the case for discussion at a recent Executive Council meeting. With the sympathy of the Executive Council members, the defendant was granted amnesty from life imprisonment and temporarily placed in the custody of the Salvation Army shelter until October of this year, when she will be completely free. Liu is several months pregnant and is expected to give birth in September of this year.</p>

<h3>China Art Troupe Gives Second Performance Yesterday</h3>
<p>The newly reborn "China Art" is moving towards a successful path in hardship. This is a gratifying piece of good news. After burying themselves in preparations, they began their second performance at the Central Theatre yesterday, lasting for three days. This is news that drama lovers are especially concerned about. It is noted that both the afternoon and evening performances yesterday were very popular, showing significant progress compared to the first time. The afternoon performance was Chen Baichen's "Elated and Delusional," satirizing the shameless activities of rogue traitors. The performance was so vivid that the audience both hated and laughed. The evening performance was the premiere of the national defense drama "Chinese Men," the latest work by progressive writer Hu Chunbing. Its main theme is to overcome the love of children and to prioritize the principle of anti-Japanese war and the nation. Chinese men would rather die than surrender. The plot was also very moving. It is said that today's afternoon performance is still "Chinese Men," while tonight's evening performance will be the Soviet play "The Government Inspector." All of the above plays are directed by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, a pioneer in spoken drama.</p>
<h3>Quadruple Murder on Steamed Lake Street in Hung Hom, Four Criminals Sentenced to Death, Chief Justice Dreams Personally Conducts Interrogation and Judgment Yesterday, First Defendant Liang Jiu Not Guilty Due to Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>Five men, (1) Liang Jiu, 20 years old, (2) Lin Jinquan, 47 years old, (3) Feng Ze, 21 years old, (4) Li Xiweng, 31 years old, and (5) Liang Dai, 43 years old, were previously charged with conspiring to murder Liang Hong at No. 155 Steamed Lake Street, Hung Hom, at the Hefeng Sundries Exchange Shop on the 5th of last month.</p>
<p>The case continued to be heard in the High Court at 1:00 AM yesterday by Chief Justice McGilligan. Deputy Attorney General Wyatt prosecuted. The first defendant, Liang Jiu, hired lawyer Guan Zuyao to transfer to barrister Luo Yisheng for defense. The other defendants hired lawyer Hu Borong to transfer to barrister Li Ronggen for defense. The jurors were Prussia (Chief), Remy Pok, Tan Qikang, Baogeluofu, Wen Wu, and Huang Shun, a total of seven people. After hearing the evidence, McGilligan instructed the jurors on the case, stating that the case was not only serious but also</p>
<p>Unusual</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the Deputy Attorney General, the murderer who killed Liang Hong may not be the defendant currently accused, but those who conspired to rob that day are an active part of it. Therefore, the jurors should carefully judge each defendant separately. The following evidence has been established, that is, several people brought wire and oranges into the house to rob, tied up the victim Liang Hong, and stuffed his mouth with oranges, causing the deceased to suffocate and die. All the measures and conversations before their robbery were not related to the first defendant because the first defendant was already in the house at this time. The first defendant is currently suspected only of conspiring to rob, but he did not participate in the robbery. He was also tied up and robbed of a gold ring by the robbers. However, if the jurors believe that he deliberately opened the door to let the robbers in, then he is as guilty as the other defendants. The jurors, due to the</p>
<p>Seriousness of the Case</p>
<p>Retired to deliberate for about two hours before returning to court, acknowledging that the first defendant was not guilty and that the second, third, fourth, and fifth defendants were guilty. The judge then sentenced the first defendant not guilty and acquitted, and the second, third, fourth, and fifth defendants were sentenced to death. He then asked each defendant if they had any comments. According to the second defendant, Lin Jinquan, he only intended to obtain property during the robbery and had no intention of killing. The two defendants Feng Ze and Li Xiweng said that the murderers that day were Lin Hai and Zhang Tao, who are still at large. The fifth defendant, Liang Dai, argued that Liang Feng lured him to participate in the robbery. Liang told him that this robbery was as easy as picking up money from the ground, so he was moved. The judge stated that the case had been decided and announced the adjournment of the court.</p>
<h3>Body of Murdered Elderly Woman Discovered in Railroad Tie Pile on King's Road, Missing for Many Days, Daughter Searched Everywhere Unsuccessfully, Murdered by Thugs Who Strangled Her and Stole Cash and Jewelry</h3>
<p>Fang Jiyuan (71 years old), an elderly woman residing on the fourth floor of No. 405 Queen's Road West, left home at 12:00 noon on the 17th of this month, dressed and ready. When leaving home, Fang told her family that she wanted to go shopping and visit relatives at the Seven Sisters Refugee Camp. The family thought she was used to going out alone and did not need to accompany her, but they told her to come back early. Unexpectedly, Fang never returned. Her daughter, Luo Shuzhen, waited until nightfall and still did not see her mother return home. She was very worried and thought that her mother was old and had been injured by a car. She reported the case to the No. 7 Police Station and inquired at various hospitals, but there was no trace of her. It was not until about 4:00 PM yesterday that a hawker named Tan Rui, who was carrying food to the woodyard of the Southwest Transportation Company on King's Road, tried to sell it to the workers. The yard had many railroad ties stored there. Tan was tired from traveling a long distance and sat on the railroad ties to rest. Inadvertently, he discovered a corpse in the railroad tie pile. Upon closer inspection, he was horrified to find that it was the corpse of an elderly woman. He immediately informed his partner and reported the case to the Causeway Bay Police Station by telephone. The Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate. Seeing that the deceased's neck was tightly tied with a handkerchief, they knew that the deceased had been murdered and immediately telegraphed the Central Police Station and police stations in various districts to file a record. Deputy Superintendent Shipton and others also arrived at the scene to investigate and suspected that the deceased had been lured to this place before being strangled to death. At the same time, the No. 7 Police Station received a telegram from the Causeway Bay Police Station, carefully checked the clothes worn by the woman, and her age, which roughly matched the report that Luo Shuzhen had made to the station a few days ago. They immediately notified Luo Shuzhen to go to the yard to identify her. When Luo Shuzhen arrived, she recognized the deceased as her mother, and she could not help but wail over the body. According to Shuzhen, when her mother left home that day, she had about ten dollars in cash in her bag, a pair of gold earrings, a bare gold ring, and a deep green jade bracelet. All the items were gone. The thugs had not only robbed her of her property but also killed her. Later, the police photographed the scene of the incident and the deceased's body, and then summoned a hearse to send the body to the morgue.</p>

<h3>Organized by the Hong Kong Branch of the Young Journalists Association, The Establishment of the Chinese News Academy is a Major Institution for Nurturing New News Warriors</h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>Since the unfolding of the sacred War of Resistance, every good son and daughter of the Chinese nation has enthusiastically contributed their wealth and strength to the motherland, directly and indirectly fighting against our × people. Consequently, all of China's journalists have also shouldered their weapons—pens—and stood on the cultural front, bravely fighting for the motherland's resistance. In the Battle of Xuzhou, defending Greater Wuhan... in every sacred battle, journalists fought with an indomitable spirit until the very last second before transferring to new positions. Furthermore, many newspapers were forced to cease publication under the ravages of × people's artillery fire and bombs. However, very quickly, they re-established new lives (like this newspaper, which is a clear example). Now, newspapers, large and small, are flourishing in various cities, towns, and even remote rural areas. This is indeed a good phenomenon in the current stage of the press!</p>
<p>Following the development of new journalistic enterprises, the great need for new news fighters is undeniable. The Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Young Journalists Association, recognizing this, planned to establish a Chinese News Academy to train a large number of news cadres and actively strengthen the power of our news front. This is indeed a task that the press cannot ignore.</p>
<p>After more than two months of preparation and running around, and with the enthusiastic support from many party, government, and educational luminaries, press leaders, social celebrities, and other sectors, this plan was quickly realized. It is said that the chairman of the board is Mr. Xu Shiying, acting chairman of the Central Relief Committee, and the vice-chairman is the famous educator Mr. Tao Xingzhi. Celebrities such as Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Ruan Weiyang, Dr. He Ailing, press leaders such as Mr. Jin Chengfu (editor-in-chief of Ta Kung Pao), and well-known figures in the press from major newspapers in Hong Kong and China are all directors of the academy. The president is Mr. Guo Butao, editor-in-chief of this newspaper, and the vice-president is Mr. Jin Zhonghua (editor of Sing Tao Daily). The director of academic affairs is Mr. Tan Siwen (editor of the Pearl River Daily). The teachers include Wu Fanwei (manager of the Lih Pao), Xu Jundao (editor of Ta Kung Pao), Luo Nepu (general manager of the Sing Pao), Wang Jiyuan (former editor of Shen Bao), Liu Simu (editor of World Knowledge), Pan Lang (editor of this newspaper), Liang Shiwen (professor at Sun Yat-sen University), Ye Qifang (editor of Sing Tao Daily), Zheng Senyu (former editor of the Monthly Report), and many other famous figures in the press who are willing to work hard to nurture this group of new news warriors. Moreover, Huang Zufeng, the principal of Chung Wah Middle School, generously offered classrooms as the site of the Chinese News Academy. The enthusiasm of people in society for training news talents is indeed a gratifying phenomenon!</p>
<p>In order to meet the aim of producing a large number of hard-working news warriors, the News Academy uses a six-month period as one term. Classes are held every evening except Saturdays and Sundays, and the tuition is very low, only five dollars per term. However, there are strict restrictions on both quality and quantity, with each term only accepting about sixty male and female students. Enrollment stops when the quota is full. To be eligible for admission, applicants must have a high school diploma or equivalent education. Special skills such as foreign languages, local dialects, photography, driving bicycles and cars, and writing shorthand are also registered separately. The curriculum is divided into: 1. Newspaper Management; 2. News Editing; 3. News Interviewing; 4. Economic News; 5. Data Organization; 6. Social News; 7. International News; 8. Political Science; 9. Modern Chinese History; 10. Special Lectures.</p>
<p>It is said that the entrance exam will be held at 1:00 PM on April 16th at the academy (Chung Wah Middle School). The entrance exam subjects are: 1. Chinese Language; 2. General Knowledge (including Chinese and foreign history, geography, politics, economics, domestic and international current affairs). The opening date is April 24th.

<h3>Extending National Salvation Propaganda from the Frontlines to Overseas: The National Salvation Drama Troupe Will Go Abroad — Qi Zhuo</h3>
<p>Meeting with Jin Shan and Wang Ying, Outstanding Sons and Daughters of the Chinese Nation</p>
<p>Special Feature by This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Extending National Salvation Propaganda from the Frontlines to Overseas: The National Salvation Drama Troupe Will Go Abroad</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Meeting with Jin Shan and Wang Ying, Outstanding Sons and Daughters of the Chinese Nation</p>
<p>Shame and inspiration converged into a surging tide of emotions. The reporter anxiously hoped to present this optimistic and encouraging good news quickly to the beloved readers, because these are all vivid stories, not just two ordinary pieces of news!</p>
<p>The name "Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe Second Team" and its spirit and achievements in traversing the battlefields and rear areas of the southeast and southwest have already filled us with longing and infinite comfort in Mr. Geng Ya's "National Salvation Organizations in Guilin" (see this newspaper on January 24 and 25), a special report from our newspaper's correspondent.</p>
<p>Historical Traces Written with Zeal and Strength</p>
<p>Since they left Shanghai around August of last year, they have passed through Suzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hankou, and the counties of Shangcheng and Macheng within the Dabie Mountains, and then traveled south along the Yuehan Railway, turning into Hunan and entering Guangxi. Along the way, they used drama and singing to propagate among the masses, educate the masses, and mobilize the masses, achieving very good results. Because of their hard work and serious lives, they received praise and welcome from military and political authorities and people from all walks of life everywhere. Now, in order to expand the national salvation propaganda to overseas and at the same time appeal to overseas Chinese on behalf of the soldiers at the front, they have decided to go to Singapore, the Philippines, the Jinshan area of ​​Southeast Asia to engage in overseas propaganda. They have already arrived in Hong Kong from Guilin via the coastal defense route yesterday. This news was first seen in a special report from a Japanese newspaper. Yesterday, the reporter made a special trip to visit them and extend his respect. Their hard-working spirit and heroic efforts were even more deeply felt:</p>
<p>The team was originally one of the fifteen wartime mobile drama teams of the Shanghai Drama Circle National Salvation Association. When they departed from Shanghai, there were only fourteen people. The leaders were the progressive film star Mr. Jin Shan and Ms. Wang Ying. Along the way of the Long March, they attracted many outstanding comrades. All the team members are enthusiastic national salvation workers and deeply interested in the drama. During the Long March, everyone contributed money and effort. For more than a year, whether in cities or villages, they performed three dramas every day. They also personally performed tasks such as washing clothes, mending socks, and carrying luggage. "Labor is sacred." They lived in two rooms, one for men and one for women, and slept on the floor. They tried their best to live a simple life. All the manuscript fees obtained from selling the team diary and two-thirds of the manuscript fees written by team members were made public. It was stipulated that each person would only receive three yuan for haircuts, laundry, and sending letters. Their three rules were: 1. The entire team is a collective, without individuals. They share life and death and work is above everything, and everything is subordinate to work; 2. All external economic affairs are completely public; 3. All public and private banquets unrelated to work are declined. This hard-working spirit is truly admirable: in the process of traveling through the front and rear of Jiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, they have already had more than seven hundred performances, entering the front lines of gunfire and traversing the remote and rugged rear areas.</p>
<p>Once, in Bengbu, it was extremely dangerous—seventy-seven × aircraft flew very low, and the air pressure lowered the trees. Many bombs were dropped in a row, and Ms. Wang Ying was almost killed. At that time, her whole body was covered in mud and smoke. When Comrade Jin Shan came to find her, he walked past her without recognizing her. This is truly a valuable experience. Their attitude towards work is also very sincere and frank. Whenever they worked jointly with several groups, they would choose the difficult tasks to do first and put their own group's name last.</p>
<p>They used their zeal and strength to encourage the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines and to mobilize the vast masses in the rear, spreading the seeds of resistance and national salvation everywhere, and achieving satisfactory results everywhere. Especially before and after the Battle of Taierzhuang, they arrived in Xuzhou and became one of the most powerful propaganda teams at the time, encouraging soldiers and mobilizing young people to defend Greater Xuzhou. In recent months, they have traveled between Hunan and Guangxi to work hard and actively mobilize the vast number of compatriots in the rear. For the past year, with the determination to save the nation, they fought amid bombing and hardship, writing a great historical record with zeal and strength—</p>
<p>Jin Shan Talks about Recent Developments and Plans</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Shan is a famous progressive film star, and also a passionate and lively hard-working young man. Because he said he opposed the title of star and called himself a worker, the reporter calls him a pragmatic young man. This pragmatic young man is the captain of the team. The team was originally called the Second Team of the Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe in the mainland, and is now renamed the "China National Salvation Drama Troupe."</p>
<p>The entire team now has thirty-two members, six of whom are women. Due to ship ticket issues, more than twenty of them will have to take the next ship to travel together. For the special mission of comforting and mobilizing overseas Chinese, the team will continue to travel to Singapore, the Philippines, and the San Francisco area with national salvation dramas, and plans to return to the front line for service in six months. They perform dramas on the front lines and in the rear, in the mountains, in the wilderness, and on the streets, and everywhere is a stage. The so-called scenery is also very simple. To go abroad, scenery and props must be well prepared. In order to make movies, machines should be purchased. The long march records and documents of the past year must also be sorted out so that they can be disseminated overseas. Therefore, sorting and preparation is the main task of the team in Hong Kong. The time will be about one or two months of stay. After preparations are completed, they plan to select some of the dozens of scripts that can be performed in Hong Kong to meet with overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. That is an exciting message. The plays that can be announced in advance are: "Long Live the Nation," "One Year," "Defend the Motherland," "New China," "The Battle of Taierzhuang" and other short plays.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin also said: In order to allow overseas Chinese to thoroughly understand the current situation of the War of Resistance and that final victory must belong to us, and not to be discouraged or disheartened by the loss of one or two cities, he asked General Bai Chongxi to send a military expert who had personally participated in the War of Resistance to travel with the team to comfort the overseas Chinese. Mr. Bai generously agreed and sent Mr. Lin Shu, the former director of the political department of a certain division in the Battle of Dachang and the current commander of the First Regiment of the Guangxi Student Army, to work together, which is really rare. The reporter also had the opportunity to listen to Mr. Lin's teachings. His hard work is admirable. A separate article will introduce Mr. Lin's remarks, so I won’t go into details here.</p>
<p>The expenses for this departure are partly helped by friends and partly subsidized by the government authorities. The team members receive three yuan a month, which can be converted into Hong Kong dollars when they arrive in Hong Kong. Mr. Jin also said: "If we can't get support, we will have to owe wages." What they seek is spiritual comfort. Young people who are not alert are not easy to settle into this kind of life.</p>

<h3>After the Fall of Ronggui, × Continued to Invade Zhongshan, Xinhui, and Heshan. Shaping Fell, and Xiaolan and Jiangmen Were Extremely Tense. × Troops Landed on Pig Head Mountain, Overlooking Our Side. × Aircraft Bombed Beijie Three Times in a Row, Followed by Xiaolan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhongshan] After the fall of Rongqi and Guizhou, × combined the five routes of × troops originally attacking Ronggui into two routes. One route proceeded from Huangpu, and the other route proceeded from Rongqi, advancing by armored electric boats and waterways, directly towards Xiaolan in Zhongshan with fierce momentum. Our Zhongshun teams, under the command of Commander Bie, set out separately to resist. The officers and soldiers of each team were extremely excited, vowing to defend the land to the death, fighting fiercely. Unexpectedly, × also pressed towards Jiangmen and Heshan, making the situation extremely tense. The various situations are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>× Troops in Two Routes Pounced on Xiaolan</p>
<p>× Armored electric boats, after passing Dongmaning, sailed to the Shakou River surface of Xiaolan, using small cannons and machine guns to strafe the shore. Our team was well prepared, ambushing on both sides in advance. At a signal, they acted simultaneously, densely strafing with heavy machine guns. For a time, shouts of killing shook the sky, and the sound of guns and cannons thundered. After about an hour of fierce fighting, ×, facing enemies on all sides, hurriedly increased its speed and retreated to Tianhe in Xinhui. × Gasoline was given and went straight to the Yinggezui River surface near Tianhe. The river surface there was wider, and × ships berthed far away and then harassed our shore. The Fifth District Guerrilla Team had received news from Zhongshan and rushed to send a large team to respond quickly. × Attacked three times and were repelled by our team before they turned danger into safety.</p>
<p>Feigned Attack on Yinggezui, Occupied Pig Head Mountain</p>
<p>At about 9:00 a.m. on the 28th, because the landing at Yinggezui was unsuccessful, × secretly divided a unit, took a rubber boat, sailed to the vicinity of Pig Head Mountain, and landed. Our team's guarding force there was relatively weak and was invaded by them. The team fought desperately, and the × army rushed to the mountains and occupied a favorable position, overlooking our side. The Fifth District Column Headquarters received the news and rushed to send a team to support, in order to prevent × from advancing and protect Jiangmen. At 12:00 noon, a × aircraft circled the sky over Jiangmen as a state of anger, and dropped three bombs at Beijie Station. After a while, a × aircraft bombed Beijie, Dali Wharf, and Yuelaichaju opposite, dropping four bombs. At 1:50 p.m., a × aircraft attacked Beijie for the third time, dropping five bombs, and the Renji Obstetrics Room was destroyed by the bombing. According to the investigation, more than 20 people were killed or injured in the three bombings.</p>
<p>After Landing in Gubugang, Strenuously Seizing Shaping</p>
<p>While × attacked Zhongshan and Xinhui, Heshan was tense at the same time. At 8:00 a.m. on the 28th, the Heqing × army fiercely bombarded Gulao Sanzhou with artillery. Our defenders also fired back. It was expected that × would contain it, and at about 9:00 a.m., at about the time when × landed on Pig Head Mountain in Xinhui, 800 × × troops from Jiujiang took armored ships densely covered with small cannons and fired at the shore. Our team, He Bai's unit, immediately responded to ×, and flew to report for help. After four hours of fierce fighting, our side was outnumbered and most of the reinforcements did not arrive as scheduled. When × × was forced to land, our team retreated to Shaping. Shaping was only eight miles away from Gubugang. × Immediately pressed along the Shagu Road to Shaping. At this time, the Fifth District Guerrilla Headquarters rushed a special team from Xin to the battlefield. The team fought hard in Shaping with He Bai's unit. The fierce battle continued all day. × We advanced and retreated, and both sides died miserably. By 4:30 p.m., various units were unable to be drawn due to the news blockade and were contained by × in Gulao. Therefore, the reinforcements did not arrive. The Fifth District Special Team and He Bai's unit made three fierce assaults and then withdrew from Shaping. Shaping fell into the hands of ×. Our army defended Pinggang and Yugang as the second defense line. The units that rushed to the scene held the Xinchiao Longkou market, and maintained close contact with the Fifth District, increased military strength, and refused to × Advance eastward along Yugang</p>
<p>It is Reported that × Invaded Jiangmen and Our Army Moved East</p>
<p>General Zha ×’s current attack on Zhongshan, Xinhui, and Heshan counties is intended to catch me off guard and achieve the purpose of defeating them one by one. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of each team fought bravely and gave up their lives. × Only Heshan has made relatively rapid progress. Revealing its current conspiracy, the purpose is to take Jiangmen from the back of Heshan and Xinhui. According to the intelligence obtained by the Fifth Guerrilla Area Column Headquarters, × Attempting to capture Jiangmen today (30th). If Jiangmen is captured, they will advance to Waihai, take Guzhen in Zhongshan, cut off my return route from Xiaolan, and further encompass all of Zhongshan, blocking my export from Guangdong. Its calculation is so. In addition to the hard fighting of the teams in various places to curb the × trend, our army's Deng Department in Gaoyao has received a report and ordered the troops of the X Division in Gaoming × to advance to Heshan day and night, flanking the × army from a certain place, cutting off its contact from beginning to end, and attacking the rear of the × army harassing Xinhui, Heshan, and Zhongshan.</p>
<p>Heshan Refugees Fled to Jiangmen</p>
<p>As of the evening of the 28th, Jiangmen waterway transportation gradually stopped. The Minxing and Lishang ferries running on the Jiangmen Shiwei section stopped on the evening of the 27th. The Deji and Zhonghua ferries running on the Rongqi Jiangmen section stopped on the evening of the 27th and changed to Qianshan Xiaolan. The Minsheng and Daan ferries from Jiangmen to Qianshan still operate as usual. The Hongji ferry from Jiangmen to Sanbu has not stopped either. As for Heshan, refugees from Shaping, Gubugang, Haikou, Yayao, Yugang, Tangxia and other places flocked to Jiangmen, and the scene was tragic.</p>
<p>The Team's Morale is Strong and It Swore to Defend Zhongshan</p>
<p>Again, after × aircraft bombed Jiangmen Street on the 28th, it turned and flew to Xiaolan. From 12:30 noon to the sky above Xiaolan Shakou, many bombs were dropped. Fortunately, the residents had been evacuated early, and there were fewer casualties. The houses were old houses, and the damage was severe. × The aircraft flew to the east of Dongbianyong and Tianjing Palace and opened fire to sweep down, causing heavy casualties. The number of people is unknown. The Xiaolan area is now extremely tense. The morale of each team is very strong and it has been prepared to coexist with Zhongshan. We must prevent the × people's plan to attack the southwest triangle area of Guangzhou from being realized. Once the Gaoming army flanks the × people, the teams of Zhongshan, Xinhui, and Heshan counties will simultaneously launch a large-scale attack. The situation of the War of Resistance, as observed by the military spirit, is indeed extremely optimistic.</p>
<h3>Details of the Fall of Ronggui: Zhu Sheng Bing Became a Traitor and Led × to Invade. Qu Rence Collided with × Ships in Guizhou.</h3>
<p>[Special News from Xijiang] The news of the fall of Rongqi and Guizhou by the × army has been reported. Now, we have received a front-line report with extremely detailed descriptions of the fall. I will relay it as follows:</p>
<p>Defending Rongqi</p>
<p>After Zha ×'s army occupied Daliang, our guerrillas gathered their forces in the Rongqi Guizhou area to block the × army's attack. Guerrilla leaders Huang Wei Tai, Zhu Kun, etc. guarded the right wing of Rongqi. Zheng Captain Li Zhenwei, Vice Captain Pan Youling, guarded Bailianchi, Sishengwei, and Rongqi market, such as the front. There are also Lu Bing, Long Wei, and others guarding various key passes, and the force is not very weak. Unexpectedly, the × in Daliang took advantage of the thick fog at 5:00 a.m. the day before, and could not see anyone opposite them, and used the bandit Zhu Sheng Bing, who had surrendered in Foshan, as a guide. In addition to Zhu Sheng Bing's army, there were more than 200 × soldiers, disguised as three × fishing boats and one Yanyun Tong × warship, carrying × soldiers, and attacked Rongqi by land and water. Li Pan and the other teams on our front fought head-on, but unexpectedly, Huang Shuntai and Zhu Kun's two troops on the right wing did not fight well and retreated first, causing the front to be surrounded. More than 100 × people then docked on the shore of Sishengwei and used warships to bombard Li Pan and other troops. Li Pan and others fought bravely with × for several hours, but were outnumbered and Rongqi fell into the hands of ×.</p>
<p>Invaded Guizhou</p>
<p>After × entered Rongqi, they set fires and plundered countless times. At the same time, a team of × attacked Guizhou. Our guerrilla captain Qu Rence's team had a melee with × for three hours, sinking one × ship and killing dozens of × people. After that, the × brigade covered them, and Qu's troops retreated to a new position in a certain district of Shunde. Then Guizhou fell. By the 28th, × sent ships to the Yinggezui area to guard again. The battle was extremely fierce that day. Artillery fire was faintly heard from Xiaolan. According to a certain adjutant from Guizhou, the loss of Rongqi this time was actually due to many traitors in the guerrillas who responded internally. A certain secretary Lu in a certain guerrilla team was also suspected, because the content of our military deployment plan was often leaked. A certain military commander was sent the news that Rongqi had fallen. He has ordered the transfer of a large force to guard certain key points and prepare to launch a large-scale northern attack.</p>
<h3>Anti-War Sentiment Among × Soldiers Intensified. A Battalion of Nishimura × Soldiers Rebelled, Were Disarmed by ×, and All Were Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>[External News from Shamian] A battalion of × Korean soldiers stationed in Xicun, Yue City, suddenly mutinied yesterday. They first killed their superior officers and then attacked the nearby × barracks. A fierce battle broke out immediately. After most of the × soldiers arrived, they surrounded and disarmed them. The rebel soldiers were escorted into the city by × soldiers. It is said that they have all been executed by firing squad. However, the × military authorities were afraid that the situation would escalate, so they refused to publicize the results of the incident, only saying that the Korean soldiers' mutiny had been completely resolved.</p>
<h3>Commander of the First District Guerrilla Team, Li Fulin, Went to the Front to Command the Guerrilla Team to Launch a Large-Scale Counterattack. The Main Force Has Been Transferred to the Front Line</h3>
<p>[Fast News from Jiangmen] After General Li Fulin was appointed as the Commander of the First Guerrilla Zone in Guangdong by the Fourth War Zone Headquarters a few days ago, he has agreed to take office. The guerrilla teams in various places under his command are preparing for reorganization. Unexpectedly, the × army used a blitzkrieg strategy, and captured Rongqi Guizhou from Daliang by land and water, affecting Jiangmen and Zhongshan in the neighboring counties and also entering a state of tension. After Commander Li received the report, he said that the military situation in the district was tight and he needed to personally go to the front to command and plan in order to avoid delaying the military opportunity. He planned to return to the Xinshun Guerrilla Zone from a certain place and ordered the main force under a certain command to proceed to the Guizhou front line to block the progress of the × army and prepare to launch a large-scale counterattack against Gui Rongqi.</p>
<h3>Peaceful Guangdong South: Coastal Warships Decrease, Appearing to Make Aggressive Moves to Conceal Weakness; Part of Our Forces Withdraw to Seize the Opportunity to Act</h3>
<p>[South Road Express] The warships along the coast of Southern Guangdong come and go sporadically, resulting in an unstable situation. According to recent intelligence, after the warships stirred up trouble in Beihai on the 23rd, they gradually sailed east in succession in recent days. Therefore, the situation in the South Road is gradually stabilizing. The latest information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Coastal Warships Decrease</p>
<p>Recently, warships have gathered along the South Road coast, patrolling and spying, and blockading our coastline. The total number of ships has been between thirty and forty, and they have occasionally bombarded the area, causing tension in various districts. However, yesterday, the 26th, the military authorities received information that some of the warships had gradually sailed elsewhere. In the sea near the eastern sharp corners of the Leizhou Peninsula, Shuijiao, Wushi and other ports, where one or two warships were originally stationed, all sailed away on the 24th and 25th. Only a few warships, numbering three or four, continue to cruise near Hai'an Port and Baihutou and Guantouling near Beihai. On the Hainan Island side, about seven or eight ships are concentrated in Haikou. Several warships are stationed at Yulin Port. It is estimated that there are about 20 warships in southern Guangdong, which is less than ten days ago. It is reported that this is because the war in the Pearl River Delta is tense, and they have rushed to provide reinforcements. However, in order to cover up their weakened deployment, on the 24th, 25th, and 26th, the electrical warships cruising along the Qinzhou and Lianzhou coast often fired artillery remotely at our shore, and dispatched rubber dinghies to survey the waterways outside various ports, pretending to be landing in an attempt to intimidate and harass. Our authorities have already seen through the conspiracy, so they have not paid attention except for monitoring.</p>
<p>People in Southern Guangdong Feel Safe</p>
<p>Recently, due to the continuous threats from aircraft and warships, and the rampant spread of rumors by traitors and villains, the people in various counties were temporarily agitated. However, since the authorities strengthened the defense of the coastal area, our defense has become increasingly consolidated. The public has become accustomed to demonstrations of force and gradually calmed down. Since Deng Shizeng and Zhang Yan took over as administrative commissioners of the seventh and eighth districts, they have spared no effort in preventing and arresting traitors and bandits. Therefore, criminals in various counties in the South Road have no place to stand, and rumors are gradually ceasing. In addition, in recent days, the weather in southern Guangdong has been cloudy and overcast, and spring rains have been continuous, so the aircraft have been less active, and the atmosphere of tension has gradually subsided. Now, the people in Suixi and Lianjiang counties are even more at peace. The stores that had voluntarily closed down before have also gradually resumed business. However, the military and political authorities, because they are most accustomed to using the trick of taking advantage of weakness to launch surprise attacks, are actively preparing for war.</p>
<p>Island Troops Withdraw</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the head of the Beihai affairs received here, after a month of heroic resistance by our military and civilians, the invading troops on Hainan Island have now been advancing and are confined to the coastal area, building defensive works to hold on, and actively opening airfields in Haikou, Wenchang, and Yaxian, as well as naval bases in Yulin, Sanya, and Haikou, as bases for the navy and air force. However, all the ground forces on the island, after repeated reinforcements ten days ago, are now withdrawing separately. On the 23rd of this month, more than 2,000 people were transported on several transport ships and sailed east. Yesterday, more than 1,000 soldiers continued to withdraw from the island, all departing at night. It is reported that they are being sent to reinforce Guangzhou. However, the military equipment and baggage stored in Haikou and Qiongshan have not been moved. The troops entrenched on Hainan Island now number about six or seven thousand, and their strength is extremely weak. Therefore, guerrillas in various places are taking the opportunity to act. The other day, they launched an attack on the forces entrenched in Ding'an City. More than 100 of our troops once rushed into the city and engaged in fierce battles, killing forty or fifty soldiers. Now, the are extremely angry and are carrying out massacres and humiliation against the strong men of various villages, which is very tragic.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang: We Urgently Prepare for Counterattack; Deploys Part of the Force to Defend to the Death; Forces Merchants to Resume Business; Commercial Centers Fall Into Stagnation</h3>
<p>(Nanhai Express) The forces entrenched in Longjiang were previously the troops of Zhi Song, under the command of the Jiujiang Command. On the 26th, it was suddenly changed, and a part of the Katano regiment of more than 200 people was transferred from Foshan to take over the defense. The reason is that the Jiujiang Command recently learned that a large army was gathering on the south bank of the West River, preparing for a counterattack, so it transferred the Longjiang forces back to reinforce the defense, in order to defend to the death. The newly arrived Katano unit in Longjiang is now stationed in the Liangting Silk Shop in Xuwai, and has issued a terrifying notice, forcing the merchants and people in Longjiang Market to return to the market and open shops within the 25th, otherwise they will be sealed up and investments will be solicited. However, the local people have been brutally ravaged and have lost everything. How can they bear to be extorted again? They would rather sacrifice everything than return to the market to resume business. Therefore, although the army has tried hard to restore the market situation, there has been no result so far. The terrifying state is daunting. Also, after the army retreated from Zhulou last week, it is sure to come once every two or three days. When they arrive, they will carry out large-scale looting, so the shops in the market have all fallen into stagnation. Only gambling dens are everywhere, forming a distorted state, with a brothel every five steps and a pavilion every ten steps.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Telegrahps to all Agencies: Bans Products from the Four Northeastern Provinces; List Specifies 22 Third-Class Items</h3>
<p>[Qujiang Express] In order to prohibit the transportation and sale of goods from the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, the Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed to various provincial governments, stating that the regulations on investigating and prohibiting goods, which were previously ordered to be followed by the Ministry on the 27th year of the Republic of China, are now related to the goods in Article 2, Item 1, Section 3 of the investigation and prohibition regulations, which are produced in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, and should be prohibited from import and sale domestically. The Ministry has already designated and announced the names of the goods. Accordingly, it telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance and the provincial governments to instruct local customs and local competent authorities to comply. Domestic merchants must not purchase these prohibited items. If there are any violations, the relevant trade associations shall report to the government for investigation. Attached is a list of the names of goods produced in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe: (1) Leather goods, (2) Deer antlers, (3) Musk, (4) Ginseng, (5) Seafood, (6) Walnuts, (7) Fresh and dried fruits, (8) Tobacco, (9) Alcoholic beverages, (10) Sugar, (11) Wood products, (12) Glass and glass products, (13) Headgear, (14) Tussah silk rayon and their products, (15) Cotton and wool goods, (16) Knitted goods, (17) Cosmetics, (18) Coal, (19) Soybeans, (20) Various processed foods, (21) Toys, (22).</p>
<h3>Traffic on the Upper Reaches of the Dongjiang River Increases Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Huiyang Communication] The traffic on the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River has always been divided into land and water routes. In the spring, when the water rises, the waterway can go directly from Heyuan to Lihua, turn into Xingning and Fengshun, and then connect to the Han River to enter Chaozhou and Meizhou. There are electric boats running. Since Huiyang once fell, the electric boats stopped running, and merchants only travel by land. The transportation of goods is still mostly blocked. Now, the authorities of various counties, in order to rectify transportation, have instructed shipping companies to resume the operation of electric boats, starting from Heyuan, passing Guanyinge, directly crossing the county seat of Longchuan, and reaching Laolong, so that the west can connect to Boluo and Huizhou, and the northeast can connect to Wuhua and Xingning, to connect the Chaoshao Highway and transfer to the Han River. The line was opened yesterday, and the traffic on the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River will increase smoothly.</p>

<h3>People Who Risk Their Lives for Money: Dangerous Work with High Income</h3>
<p>In Jesse James, Tyrone Power rode a horse and jumped into the water from a height of seven thousand feet... For this scene, Cliff Lyons, a stunt performer, earned 1,770 yuan for two hours of work. In Dodge City, you will see three people fighting on a balcony 22 feet above the ground. When they fight to the point where it is difficult to separate them, they break the railing and fall onto a roulette table below. For this scene, Cliff Lyons, Harley Bailey, and Link Grand received a total of 1,445 yuan, each receiving 485 yuan. Stunt performers do dangerous work, but they work few hours and receive high pay.</p>
<p>These people can earn thirty-five yuan a day, but this reward is indeed the most difficult to get. There is a regulation that as long as the director can think of any kind of thrilling scene, they must perform it. For example, Lyons would receive only seventy-five yuan for jumping into deep water from a height of forty feet. If he jumped from the same height, but the water in the pool was not deep, then the price would be as high as three hundred and fifty yuan. Rolling down a flight of stairs costs fifty yuan, but if the stairs are curved, the price will increase to one hundred and twenty-five yuan. If necessary, they should fall from a high place with another actor, or other scenes, the price will be even higher, because being with others, their own grasp will always be smaller.</p>
<p>Stunt performers earn an average of 7,500 yuan per year. In some years, when action-packed movies are popular, their income often reaches 18,000 yuan. Some of them have been doing this work for 25 years. Usually, the life span of this kind of performer on the screen is only 13 years. Because they are very confident and skilled, the British insurance company, Lloyd's, believes that insuring them is more secure than insuring police officers and firefighters. In the past ten years, no one has died among them. Many outsiders want to join their union. There are one thousand people already registered as candidates, but their group is more difficult to join than anything else.</p>
<p>They hate musicals the most, because musicals absolutely do not need them. They are their mortal enemies, and often because musicals are popular, they put the movies on which they depend for food and clothing on the shelf.</p>
<p>Movies such as Jesse James, Dodge City, Robin Hood, Wells Fatgo, Everywhere Gold, Stand Up and Fight, Swordsman, and Suez are their most welcome. Sometimes they agree to perform a thrilling shot, but the people who prevent cruelty to animals interfere, and the result is that they have to stop. Lyons' shot of riding a horse and jumping into the water from seventy feet is prohibited in California, so they have to take the movie to the south to shoot it. But although this is the case for animals, there has never been a single case where it is not allowed for "people" to perform this kind of nine-death-one-life drama. This is also a strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>In addition to these eighteen experts (headed by Balai), there are two other groups - equestrian actors and aviators. These three groups each have their own territory and do not invade each other. Crashing an airplane or falling from a horse is their exclusive special skill, so they must practice every day, otherwise, if there is a mistake, even their lives will be lost.</p>
<p>One of the interesting behind-the-scenes things in Hollywood is seeing the movie company's team leader, director, and stunt performers discussing the price of a scene when filming a movie like Dodge City. First, the director patiently explained how he planned to shoot the scene. Then the performer tried it once in the same way. After the test, he decided that the price of this scene should be eighty-five yuan. The director was furious. So one of the performers asked him, "Director, if you were to perform, how much would you charge?" The director excitedly replied, "This is different, I don't make a living from this." So they compromised - still four hundred and eighty-five yuan.</p>
<p>Although their skills are superb, the cruelty to horses is often unavoidable. The most common thing is to use a wire rope on the horse's hooves, calculate the size, so that it falls just in front of the camera. When you see a galloping horse, suddenly tripped by an invisible wire, tumbling and throwing the rider off, what a wonderful shot! But have you ever thought of those poor horses?</p>
<p>It is much better in England, because the British love horses the most. They pay special attention to the places where horses are used in movies. Permission to open and show can only be granted if the horses are not abused in any way.</p>
<p>I just said that stunt performers rarely get injured, but accidents are inevitable after all. For example, Balai, who leads the group, has performed countless scenes of falling from high cliffs, car crashes, falling from horses, and thrilling fights. There has never been a time when he was injured to the point of being unable to work. But once, he played one of two drunkards, and slipped on the snow while walking by the side of the road. This was originally a very easy thing, but he ended up breaking his back because there was a wooden stake in the snow that he didn't know about. Although it was an "old woman of thirty falling on a child", it was an extremely unexpected thing, but it also shows that it is not easy to make a living from this.</p>
<h3>Joan Crawford Divorce Case: Rescheduled for Trial</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hollywood, 28th] Film star Joan Crawford's request for a divorce was postponed because she failed to appear in court today. The court ruled that the case would be adjourned to April 18 for retrial.</p>
<h3>Ferdinand the Bull Banned in Germany, Italy, and Japan</h3>
<p>Movie heroes have always been respected. Filmmakers are also well aware of the audience's psychology and produce epic films of heroes and beauties.</p>
<p>But have you seen Walt Disney's new cartoon, Ferdinand the Bull? He doesn't like to fight. No matter how the bullfighters challenge him, even kneeling to beg for a fight, he ignores them. He just smells the flowers thrown down by people. He is sent back, sits under a tree, lazily smelling the flowers, and spends his days in peace and quiet.</p>
<p>This film is very popular in various countries, but for the war-loving heroes, it is a major insult. It has been banned in Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<p>Ferdinand's spirit is certainly not worthy of emulation, but it is not necessary to ban it. To put it bluntly, it is "lack of humor."</p>
<h3>Errol Flynn: Likes to Fight</h3>
<p>Errol Flynn mostly plays heroes who help those in need in movies. In his daily private life, he is also a person who likes to fight. Although it is not certain whether the motive is right, at least his love of fighting is in line with his on-screen personality. He once had a conflict with a senior official of 20th Century Fox at a banquet and got into a fight. The two fought so fiercely that the hostess had to postpone the banquet.</p>
<p>Errol's lip was cracked and bleeding, and a tooth was broken. When filming the next day, he had to shoot mostly from the side. His opponent was even more miserable, with a broken jaw and unable to work for a day.</p>

<h3>Southern China vs. Scotts in Group B Rescheduled to April 4; Former Player Bei Hua to Play</h3>
<p>(Special Report) The Group B football league has reached its final stage, but the championship still depends on the final battle between Southern China and Scotts. Although Scotts has no chance of winning the championship, its strength is very strong and should not be underestimated. The recent scores of the top three are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Games Won Tied Lost Points</p>
<p>Middlesex 22 18 1 3 37</p>
<p>5th Battalion Artillery 22 17 3 2 37</p>
<p>Southern China Club 21 17 2 7 36</p>
<p>The Middlesex and Artillery have completed 22 games and each has 37 points. Southern China has played 21 games and has 36 points. If they win the final game against Scotts, they will win the championship. If they lose, they will not even get the runner-up position. If Southern China loses, it will be one point behind the Middlesex and Artillery. At that time, the championship and runner-up will be contested by two foreign teams. Even if the game between Southern China and Scotts ends in a tie, it is also a cause for concern, because at that time, the scores of the three teams will be the same, and a triangular final will be held to resolve the championship. However, Southern China may not be able to win all the games in the final, so the fate of Southern China depends entirely on whether it can defeat Scotts, and it must strive for victory. I hope all the players of Southern China will work hard.</p>
<p>The game between Southern China and Scotts was originally scheduled for (Monday, April 3) at 5:00 pm at Caroline Hill. Now, with the agreement of the two teams, it has been changed to April 4 (Tuesday) at 3:30 pm at Sukanpu. Veteran Ye Bei Hua may play. The next game at 5:00 pm will be the Southern China vs. Scotts game in the Group A league. The schedule for the next few days is as follows:</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Basketball Game: Pui Ying Defeated by Chung Sing; Group B Youth Team Crushes Kwong Hong and Yuan Sinks Kwan Lei</h3>
<p>The public men's basketball tournament held three games last night at the Youth Fitness Center. In the first game, Group B Morning Light faced the Youth Team. After the start of the game, Morning Light took the lead, with Yu Yizhuang, Deng Xiechang, and Huang Rong scoring baskets one after another. The Youth Team's Liang Ren and Yan Zhigang also fought back, but Morning Light's defenders strongly resisted the incoming offense. In the first half, Morning Light led 17-14, giving the Youth Team an initial disadvantage. The Youth Team then mobilized its entire team, with Yan Zhigang, Yu Shouheng, Guo Fuchang, Gu Liangren, and Wu Huanzhang attacking from both near and far, repeatedly scoring points. Morning Light's Yu Yizhuang, Ma Riming, and Yu Yiqiang tried their best to counterattack with little success. As a result, the Youth Team reversed the score to win 37-23.</p>

<p>In the second game, Group A Chung Sing faced Pui Ying. Both teams were strong contenders in this year's tournament. Tonight, the two powerhouses met, both sending out their elite teams to compete. Chung Sing's Shen Ruiqing and Guo Zhihong only arrived ten minutes after the start of the game, which greatly boosted the morale of the team. In addition, Chen Ruzheng and Zhang Rensheng went straight ahead, attacking relentlessly. Shen and Guo also kept up the pressure. Although Pui Ying's offense was fierce, their shooting accuracy was lacking. Li Lianze and Qiu Guangxie tried their best to support, but ultimately felt powerless. Chung Sing's coordination and passing were exceptionally quick, and their defense was tight. Pui Ying entered the treasure mountain but came away empty-handed. As the game began, Chen Ruzheng took the lead, scoring the first point. Li Lianze led his team to attack, achieving some success. Zhang Rensheng then scored under the basket, and Li Lianze followed up, also scoring. The two sides then maintained a 7-7 tie. At this time, the two fresh forces, Guo Zhihong and Shen Ruiqing, suddenly arrived, greatly boosting Chung Sing's morale, and their score skyrocketed. At halftime, they led 30-15. Switching sides, Pui Ying, having initially suffered a loss, had Liu Zemin and He Rirong join the battle, slightly boosting their morale. However, Chung Sing took advantage of their momentum, with Chen Ruzheng, Li Yuanfen, and Shen Ruiqing attacking from three directions, putting Pui Ying in a desperate situation. Fortunately, Qiu Guangxie tried his best to support, occasionally fighting back, but because the team's coordination was not as good as Chung Sing's, the overall situation was difficult to reverse. By the end of the game, they lost 38-56.</p>

<p>In the final game, Group B Kwan Lei faced Kwong Hong and Yuan. Kwan Lei previously recorded strength and courage, but their passing was slow and their shooting was inaccurate. Kwong Hong and Yuan, on the other hand, were coordinated, with Xue Qiuchun and Qu Yongfu rising and falling, frequently reporting victories. After the start of the game, Kwan Lei's Ding Jinbang, Yang Youduo, and Meng Chaoding tried their best to attack, achieving some success, but ultimately Kwong Hong and Yuan were stronger, and their gains were not much. Conversely, when Kwong Hong and Yuan attacked, Kwan Lei's defenders found it difficult to cope, so they gained more than they lost, and were defeated 25-39.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament held two singles matches. Li Huitang defeated Liang Bingzhao twice with a score of 6-0, which was unexpected. The match between Xu Runpei and Gao Lute was more intense. In the first set, Xu underestimated his opponent, making frequent mistakes. Only when the score was tied at 5-5 did he rally and attack, finally winning 7-5. In the second set, Xu did not dare to be negligent and won again with 6-1. Today's schedule is quite good, and it is expected that the match between Lin Tiande and Fen Zha will be a fierce battle.</p>

<h3>Group C South China Loses to the 30th Battalion Soldiers; Hopes for Second Place Dashed; Artillery and Aircraft Finals This Saturday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Group C Football League championship has already been won by the Tenth Division, but the second-place spot is still being contested. At 5:15 PM yesterday, South China and the 30th Battalion Artillery competed for the second-place final spot at the Xianggang Club venue. As a result, South China lost 2-3 after initially leading, dashing their hopes for second place, which is quite regrettable.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, the artillery players often had an advantage due to their tall stature, but their technical performance was mediocre. Shortly after the start of the game, South China took advantage of a corner kick to score first. However, the artillery quickly countered and scored, ending the first half at 1-1.</p>
<p>In the second half, shortly after the restart, South China took advantage of a penalty kick to lead 2-1. However, the artillery's offense was very aggressive, and they scored two goals in less than two minutes, reversing the score to 3-2 and ending the game. Now that the artillery has secured the second-place final spot, they will face the Aircraft Team on April 1 (Saturday) to compete for the second-place spot. The South China lineup yesterday was as follows:</p>
<p>Zeng Qirong</p>
<p>Chen Haiqing Ding Jiantang</p>
<p>He Luoji Yang Weili Gou Xi Yaoming</p>
<p>Mo Haoran Yin Lugen He Youji Yin Zhuoxin Hu Chaozong</p>
<h3>On School Sports in Hong Kong (1)</h3>
<p>— Excellence</p>
<p>School sports in Hong Kong, on the surface, seems to be thriving. However, after factual investigation and research, it is truly laughable. When I was in Guangzhou, because I only had access to secondhand information, I always thought that Hong Kong's school sports were optimistic, extremely popular, and very developed. But after working in Hong Kong, I was able to truly understand what Hong Kong's sports really are. In fact, it still cannot escape the pitfalls of sensationalism and the athlete system. Although many sports colleagues have been able to advocate and shout—what kind of "universal sports," "overthrowing athlete sports," etc.—what they do is still sensationalist, and even buying athletes. From this point of view, although the general public has ideas for reform, they lack implementation. Therefore, we still hope that the colleagues in school sports administration can strengthen their "action" and will now describe the shortcomings of school sports in the past or present, and the facts that should be promoted and reformed, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Status of Sports in General</p>
<p>Schools</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Education's regulations, secondary schools (based on the number of students) should have a director and an instructor each. Schools above secondary level should have two instructors, plus the director, totaling three or more. Even the smallest schools (with more than 100 people) should have one instructor. The funding for school sports is independent, but in Hong Kong's general schools, the status of sports is too low. Many schools simply do not have a sports department. Occasionally, those that do simply pull someone to serve as the head and teach a few ordinary exercises and other nonsensical foot techniques. During class, students are allowed to do whatever they want, and that's it. Those who pay a little attention are thinking about the athletes. Regarding sensationalist sports, they have not been able to see the high status and high character (morality) that sports should have, and must not allow others to use it. People from all walks of life should not use sports and contaminate it, and should care about the morality and status of sports. Therefore, I hope that the school authorities should value sports morality (to be continued +</p>

<h3>Welcoming Compatriots from the Singapore Football Circle (3)</h3>
<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>(6) Deng Yuehan visited the motherland in 1931, and all the football friends who have come into contact with him have appreciated his guarding skills. He is not only a good central defender, but also very accomplished in track and field. This time, he is accompanying the team as the "team leader", and we will definitely have the opportunity to appreciate his skills.</p>
<p>(7) Left center back Lin Zhiqian. I personally consider him to be the ideal left center back for the World Games team a few years ago. His calm mind and clever wit make his short stature not suffer at all. His passing is accurate, agile, and tenacious, and looking around the current country, there is really nothing comparable. Unfortunately, he gave up his right to be selected due to personal matters, and even stopped playing football. Such a good talent is only a fleeting flower. It is a great loss to the true football world.</p>
<p>The above are outstanding talents, and they are the hair and horns of the football world, and it is extremely difficult to discover comets. There are other outstanding famous generals. Let me also report their names: (1) Yang Yajiang (goalkeeper), (2) Chen Yushu (defender), (3) Cai Yaoshun (defender), (4) Zhong Zilin (center), (5) Feng Wendong (left winger), (6) Cai Kunan (right winger), and the rising stars who are currently accompanying the team: (1) Li Botang (goalkeeper), (2) Zhu Chenggui (center back), (3) Xu Houkun (left midfielder), (4) Ji Youling (right midfielder), (5) Wu Zhan Shi (right winger), (6) Chen Kaiwan (known as the best right in all of Malaya), the above people are all rare talents in the football world, and there are probably many good players who have been discovered recently but have not been seen by the author, In short, the strength of the Singapore Chinese team is enough to pose a supreme threat to any team in the East, there is no doubt.</p>
<p>We have this opportunity to applaud and welcome them to perform their skills, and at the same time, it can also be seen as a coincidence for Chinese football strengths at home and abroad to compete with each other. Regardless of who wins or loses, the football friends will of course wholeheartedly seize this opportunity to further study their skills, and the audience will definitely come to appreciate true art with all their heart and soul. If they win, we should applaud and praise them. If they unfortunately lose, they have done their best, and we should also praise their fighting spirit. We are united in our hearts, and the only hope is that they can discover their own shortcomings in this long journey and work hard to improve them, so that their football skills can go to a higher level, and in the sports world of Singapore and Malaya, they can make the Chinese, who have the title of "Sick Man of East Asia," stand tall and win some honor.</p>
<p>With a sincere heart, let me bless this group of good friends, "Live comfortably in Hong Kong and return to Singapore safely." (The End)</p>

<h3>The Comedy of Running Away from Madrid</h3>
<p>— Translated conscientiously by Guzinan</p>
<p>This is not a play, nor a novel, but a true story. In today's popular parlance, it is a piece of reportage. This is an excerpt translated from "Red and Black Madrid" by Guzmán. Because the description of the armed populace preventing the deserting officials is so interesting, I have "contrived" this title for it.</p>
<p>The lives of prominent officials have always been more "valuable" than those of ordinary people, whether in ancient times or in modern times, and in any country. Whenever danger looms, they are the first to run away. I hope that the Chinese people will one day be able to teach these money-loving and life-loving fellows a lesson like the people of Spain did.</p>
<p>On the early morning of November 7th, the battle continued bitterly. Countless new groups of workers continuously set off towards the threatened districts, most of them without weapons, waiting to obtain the arms left behind by the fallen. Just like on the 7th, people were scrambling for guns. In the most dangerous positions, at the foot of those walls, in those houses temporarily serving as fortresses, the workers kept shooting at the × people. Every gunshot was an expression of the entire people's will:</p>
<p>—No passing through—</p>
<p>Planes flew in formation, tanks charged forward, the roar of cannons deafening; the battle had reached indescribable intensity. In the Carabanchel district, some teams were gradually retreating. The × people had broken through our defense line, approaching the Toledo Bridge. Then, several comrades ran over from the side (referring to the anarchists! Translator's note), leading them were Isabelo, Lomer, and Juan Torres. They roared:</p>
<p>——Cowards! Cowards!</p>
<p>Many people stopped in shame. Many people still wanted to flee in a panic. With pistols pointed at their heads, they had no choice but to turn back. They scattered along the bridge, behind the walls. Many comrades were ordered not to allow anyone to escape privately. Isabelo climbed onto a window and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>——Comrades, fight them! Charge! Long live the CNT!</p>
<p>Isabelo was the secretary of the provincial committee (referring to the provincial committee of the anarchist CNT). He also stood behind those walls shooting, like all our people. Those fleeing were another group of people. Everyone followed Isabelo and Torres, like an avalanche, destroying the advancing fascist troops. Countless Moors piled up in heaps on the Peninsular Road. Our troops chased forward fiercely, past the slaughterhouse, all the way to Lower Carabanchel. The enemy could no longer pass through here.</p>
<p>Similarly, they could not pass through Usera, nor through Villaverde, nor through the Extremadura Avenue. All of Madrid rose up. Republicans, Socialists, Communists, and Anarchists, stood shoulder to shoulder on the same front like their own brothers, fighting together with the determination to win victory. This day was fought heroically from morning to night. Ammunition was exhausted, but people did not retreat.</p>
<p>At 8 pm on the 6th, Miaja received an official document sealed with sealing wax from the Vice-Minister of the Army, ordering him not to open it until 8 am on the 7th. When he opened it, it was an order appointing him as the Supreme Commander of the Defense of Madrid. The order instructed him to organize a committee and take all measures to evacuate military supplies. Early in the morning of the 7th, Miaja began to act. He summoned all parties and all organizations, clearly explaining the urgency of the situation. The Defense Committee had to be organized that afternoon. The committee was organized without any obstacles, amidst the sounds of battle that shook the nerves of the capital.</p>
<p>When an assistant of Miaja was leaning on the platform at noon, a journalist said to him with a sarcastic tone:</p>
<p>——What, looking for a way out, aren't you?</p>
<p>The soldier put on a serious face and replied:</p>
<p>——No, we are not running, we will die at our posts... Afterwards, he replied mockingly:</p>
<p>——I'm here to see if I can already see the Moorish cavalry—In the afternoon, the Defense Committee was established. When everyone slightly examined the situation, they couldn't help but be astonished. The military strength defending Madrid consisted of only one hundred boxes of rifle bullets, cannon shells to support three hours of firing, and seven machine guns being repaired. That was all. As for the army, there were only six columns that had lost their fighting spirit and were constantly retreating. But no one wavered, and no one was shocked. A unanimous decision was made:</p>
<p>—We will resist to the end—</p>
<p>In Burgos, in Valladolid, and in Salamanca, there was great joy. No one doubted the fall of Madrid. Franco said:</p>
<p>——We don't need to spend a single bullet to enter Madrid...</p>
<p>Mola confirmed the "Commander-in-Chief's" sentence:</p>
<p>——Taking Madrid will be nothing more than a simple military promenade...</p>
<p>Foreign military experts also held the same view. In Paris, in Rome, in Berlin, in London, all the fascist newspapers prepared large-font headlines to announce the rebels' victory to the world.</p>
<p>In Leganés, under the leadership of La Llave, the future municipal officials of Madrid were convened to hold a meeting. In Móstoles, more travel teams were gathered to lead the fascist dignitaries to attend the city entry ceremony. Franco ordered his subjects and officials to wear festive clothes, and the Moorish soldiers were laughing wildly, sniffing the fresh flesh of the women of Madrid...</p>
<p>Franco said to a group of foreign journalists with joy and arrogance:</p>
<p>——Madrid is already in our hands. All the highlands are under our control, and there is no possibility of defense. If you understand military knowledge, you will definitely not attempt this useless resistance...</p>
<p>But the workers of Madrid laughed at that specialized knowledge. They decided to fight for a victory, taking rifles, pistols, hunting guns, and grenades, and rushing towards the barricades. They would not retreat a single step until death, and the fascists would not be able to pass through...</p>
<p>In Albarracín, there were three members of the CNT. They were all veterans who had fought in Somosierra and in Gredos. They belonged to the famous divisions of Mora, Felix, Olozabal, Fernández, and the Free Youth Groups. Their leaders were all strong figures of steel, such as Cipriano Mera, Carlos and Casquete. Sanz, Muiño, Arínás, Domínguez, Germán...</p>
<p>After receiving the bad news from Madrid on the 7th, Mera immediately gathered his people and said to them:</p>
<p>——Madrid is in danger. We should go to save it. But no one should have illusions, this time we are going to die. Whoever is willing to go, take a step forward...</p>
<p>Not one of the three thousand people hesitated, and everyone took a step forward. Mera smiled happily. He had no other demands. But he had to speak again to inform them: (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk on Wall Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Bayan</p>
<p>The popularity of wall newspapers is only in the last two or three years. I remember that after the "August 13th" Shanghai Anti-Japanese War broke out, the "National Salvation Daily" hosted by Mr. Guo Moruo and others published many wall newspapers. Before the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department's special commissioner, Mr. Zhou Houjun, founded the literary supplement "Ganlu" in the "Su Bao," which published one or two thousand-word novels every day. The content, form, and subject matter were all very eye-catching, and these can all be summarized as wall newspapers.</p>
<p>Wall newspapers are special, concise, and short literary works, which, together with short stories of about ten thousand words or lengthy masterpieces of hundreds of thousands of words, are the spiritual food of the masses. In certain situations, the "subtle influence" of wall newspapers has a more moving power than the latter.</p>
<p>Some people have opposed writing wall newspapers, saying that these short, overly "blunt" and unreserved things are too unrigorous, painstaking, and meticulous, and seem to lack literary value. I am going to vote against this argument. In order to suit the knowledge level and reading ability of the masses, I think that wall newspapers should not only be promoted, but also need to have a universal expansion.</p>
<p>Wall newspapers are a branch of "mass literature." For the masses, they are like sesame cakes and fried dough sticks that cost three copper coins each—anyone can afford them and can often eat them. They are only about one or two thousand words long. The content and form are practical, popular, and easy to understand. The stories are also full of the power of "edification" and "warning." As long as you can organize words, anyone can read and understand them. And it only takes three to five minutes to read a novel, which is really economical.</p>
<p>The effect of wall newspapers is not only to alert and encourage the masses, but also to bear the mission of educating the masses. Therefore, we must be cautious, pay close attention, and carefully consider when writing them: What materials should we look for in order to be popular and arouse a little uneven wave in the hearts of the masses? How should we describe them so that the masses will not feel bored and ordinary, but feel concise and vivid? How should we lay out the plot, save space, and economically write a complete story and specifically carve out several typical characters in it?</p>
<p>Don't underestimate writing wall newspapers as an easy task. If we cannot get close to the lives of the masses, we will not be able to understand the conditions of all classes, and a wall newspaper written may sometimes be neither donkey nor horse, and cause laughter.</p>
<p>I think a good wall newspaper must have the following conditions: (1) Short in number of words and complete in story. (2) Concise description, realistic characterization. (3) Fluent dialogue, concise, full of edification and guidance. (4) The work has a very correct consciousness. (5) The subject matter is timely, fresh, and eye-catching. (6) Find a powerful sentence or a special action from the work as the title, so that the masses can easily understand it. (7) It is best to describe and narrate "people" and "things" in one article at the same time. (8) The words and sentences must be popular and easy to understand.</p>
<p>The above eight conditions are what writers of wall newspapers should pay attention to. Naturally, in the process of continuous writing, there will definitely be more discoveries that can be harvested as new theories.</p>
<h3>To the Southern Route</h3>
<p>— Yuan Jianming</p>
<p>We—the Wartime Work Team of the Fourth War Zone Mass Mobilization Committee, set off for Jiujiang to carry out the second phase of the anti-Japanese war work in the occupied areas, passing through Lan Shi, Lecong, Baja, Longshan, etc. The solemn atmosphere of the villages along the way excited the hearts of every passerby. We interspersed in these villages, seeing the solemn and tense faces of the masses, showing their heroic posture. We thought, if the enemy invades, they can indeed advance step by step, ambushing everywhere.</p>
<p>After running for ninety miles, we reached Jiujiang. We planned to start working here, but soon we received an order from the committee saying that we should go to work on the Southern Route. So we changed direction and said goodbye to Jiujiang.</p>
<p>Along the way, we passed through Gaolao, Sanzhou, and other places, which have now been occupied. Then we passed through Gaoming and turned to Gao Yao, entering Zhaoqing City.</p>
<p>Zhaoqing is located on the north bank of the West River, with Guangzhou to the left and Cangwu to the right, controlling the passage of the West River and acting as the waist and arm of the two Guangs. It is a place that must be contested militarily. To the east is Lingyang Gorge, with steep peaks and ridges on both sides, stretching continuously for hundreds of miles. The river flows like a galloping horse, and the terrain is dangerous. We think that the enemy is insatiably opening its blood basin mouth, madly dreaming of annexing the entire China. Who can be sure that this place will not become a battlefield? For survival, for justice, thousands of Chinese sons and daughters will stand up here, ready to sprinkle their blood all over the mountains.</p>
<p>Zhaoqing City is as dead as ruins after a robbery. Most of the shops are closed, the population has decreased, and it has suddenly become a wartime state. Besides our working groups and heroic armed soldiers, there is nothing else on the streets...</p>
<p>For the sake of the journey, we had to embark on our journey. After taking a sailboat for six hours, we arrived at Sandu, which was already late at night. Then we walked, along the Yundu Highway towards Yunfu under the starry night. There was nothing along the way, only the dark sky and a few solitary stars hanging high, and the sounds of insects and running water mixed together. There were also a few fireflies shining in the distance, as if illuminating a bright road for us to move forward. After running for seven hours, we finally arrived in Yunfu City. That day, enemy planes indiscriminately bombed the unarmed Yunfu City, and our comrades almost suffered disaster.</p>
<p>The next day, we set off for Luoding. After running for a day, we arrived at Anzhen Town. Although this road ruined our legs, in order to strive for national freedom and liberation, we arranged ourselves in this hard life and had to rush day and night.</p>
<p>It is more than two hundred miles from Luoding City to Xinyi County, Gaozhou Prefecture, and it took two days. Along the Luoxin Highway, we passed through small towns such as Taipingxu, Heshui, and Baishi. The road was very rugged, with towering mountains and misty fog covering the entire sky. Cars could not pass, and it was easy to roll down the mountain. Looking down, the fields were crisscrossed, but the hills were always bare, and the scenery was barren and desolate.</p>
<p>From Xinyi to Maoming, there are seventy or eighty miles, but there are no cars to sit in, and you need to walk. Singing national salvation songs along the way, the magnificent singing drove away fatigue and guided us to the front. This singing awakened the towns and villages and shook the quiet mountains and forests.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>After he heard her sigh, he felt an unreasonable blame added to himself. He rearranged her collar for her, which was to relieve his own sense of guilt. The strong are difficult to submit to the thugs, but are easily softened by the weak. This is how he behaved at this time. He asked her with some self-reproach:</p>
<p>"Are you uneasy?"</p>
<p>'Don't ask me!'</p>
<p>Although this answer was rebellious in tone, it sounded like a very reluctant voice—the stubborn character of the weak for a moment. He thought for a moment and asked her again:</p>
<p>'Do you hate me?'</p>
<p>'What do you think?'</p>
<p>'I think you hate me, but you shouldn't!'</p>
<p>'Humph, shouldn't! You shouldn't be a bandit! You are such a young person, and you seem to have studied; aren't there many ways to live in the world? Why do you have to do this kind of damage to others and benefit yourself? Humph, if you are not careful... then you will regret it!"</p>
<p>This was like an ignorant old man teaching his unfilial children with sincerity; although, that was so naive. He almost laughed when he heard it. Therefore, he told her in detail the main cause, process and predicted results of this incident. When he spoke, it was as if a political propagandist was trying to agitate and persuade a crowd. Finally, he asked her:</p>
<p>'Don't you believe that I am a volunteer army?'</p>
<p>She believed it. However, her original aversion to bandits immediately shifted to the volunteer army, and she regretted her previous expectations for them, her help, and her father's scolding.</p>
<p>'Do you object?'</p>
<p>'Object, object, a hundred objections!'</p>
<p>Her small heart had already been sown with the seeds of hatred, even if he gave her pills to eliminate hatred, I'm afraid there would not be a single gap to stay, even if there was a gap, it would definitely change.</p>
<p>When her hand unintentionally touched the sharp knife in her pocket, she carried the seeds of hatred and sprouted the tender seedlings of revenge. (22)</p>
