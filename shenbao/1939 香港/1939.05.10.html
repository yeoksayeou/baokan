<h3 id="c1">改善華僑敎育問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>中華民族正在存亡續絕的緊急關頭，××勝利則民族獲得獨立生存與自由，××失敗則國家淪亡而全中國各民族均不免永為奴隸，而寄身於海外的華僑，其生活亦必有不堪設想的！因此我們今日必須集中一切心力物力，以爲××服務，以求××勝利。文化教育事業，固當不能例外，華僑文化教育事業，尤其不能例外。這是情理之常，用不到多加解釋的。不過各地華僑文化教育，多因處境特殊，與國內教育系統，多不銜接，尤其是對於目前××建圃事業，多不適應，因此而影嚮及於××建國事業者，實屬不忍設想！這又是每一有頭腦有遠見有心肝的華僑敎育從業員的常識，也用不到多加解釋的。我們目前的問題，就是要怎樣依據各地特殊的環境，實行華僑教育的改善，俾其適應今日祖國××建國的需要，而能有助於中華民族整個解放事業。我們就想在此貢獻所見，以爲正在推進改善華僑教育工作諸君的參考。</p>
<p>第一，我們應該切實明瞭祖國目前急需實現的教育政策。國民黨的××建國綱頭，曾經揭示當前改善教育的基本綱領是：『改訂教育制度及教材，推行戰時教程，注重於國員道德之修養，提高科學研究，與擴充其設備。訓練各種專門技術人員，與以適當之分配，以應××需要。訓練靑年，俾能服務於戰區及農村。訓練婦女，俾能服務於社會事業，以增加××力量』。最高領袖蔣委員長對全國教育會議訓詞又說『現在時代，無論個人或社會，若不是實行戰時生活，就不能存在，就要被人淘汰減亡』。同時遠訓示全國教育界說：『我們要建設我們國家成一個現代國家，我們在各部門中需要有若千萬個專門學者，幾十萬乃至幾百萬技工和技師，更需要幾百萬教師和民衆訓練幹部。這些都是要由我們教育界來供給的。』×××××××××××第三，我們明白了目前祖國所急需的教育政策與改善教育的方針以後，便要斟酌各地實際情形，盡一切力量，以求逹到目前祁國對我們所期望的目的。我們必須力爭實現華僑敎育能够適應目前祖國此種迫急需要，同時在教育過程中注力於以下幾點，卽（一），要培飬民族意識，提高華僑的民族自尊心和擁護××的情緒，和××必勝建國必成的自信心。爲要實現這一要求，就必須加強政治教育，研究社會科學，舉行對於政治情勢的集體討論。因爲祇有使華僑靑年及各界民衆××××××有深入的認識，才能眞正堅定其意志。二，要提高國家民族觀念，使每一華僑認識國家的可愛與全民族力量的偉大。爲要實現這一要求，鼓勵爭求民主政治與華僑參政的情緒；因爲祇有使華僑與祖國政治發生密切關係，才能使華僑自動地積極地爲祖國而服務，敎育界對此所負責任自要重大。（三）要在學課以外，或配合學課，積極地領導僑胞　教育僑胞，組織僑胞。爲要實現這個要求，就必須一面努力培飬大批靑年幹部，領導他們去做僑胞動員工作，一面努力創辦各種補習學校，展開新文字運動及般識字運動，並利用救亡戲劇，××歌詠等等，以發展民衆教育。</p>
<p>第三，我們還要知道，當我們努力於改善華僑教育事業之時，一定要遭遇種種外來的和內部的阻難，我必須平心靜氣地認識阻難的來源實况，决定應付的方法與步驟，進行堅韌的鬥爭。目前所要特別注意的，第一，就是那些只知個人利益，把個人利益看得比國家民族利益更高的人，就是那些悲觀失望的主和份子，他們雖不一定就是漢奸，但事實上他們已做了日×的工具；第二就是那些鼓吹『王道樂土』『大亞細亞』『反共親日和平』等言論的，××××××××××</p>
<p>最後，我們華僑教育界人士，亦常育因爲在生活上受挫折，在思想上無出路，而苦悶徬徨，悲觀消沉，動搖腐敗起來的。這是因爲他們平時對於國家與國際情勢，總是漢不關心，對於一般政治理論，又以爲不屑研究，因此對於千變萬化錯綜複雜的時局，就有茫然不知如何之慼。認識不淸，意志無從堅定，精力無從集中，不能緊張活潑，奮發有為，再加上個人生活上的苦惱，甚至走，民族失敗主義的道路，因悲觀失望而走上動搖，妥恊，投降求和以貽誤民族的黑路的！因此，我們必須加緊教靑界本身的團結，掃蕩萎靡腐敗的積習，飬成蓬蓬勃勃的朝氣，實現華僑教育界的精神動員，我們一面要在實踐上以身作則地去和一切阻難鬥爭，去領導靑年和一般僑胞，一面還要在這種實際工作中加緊自己的學習與修餋，首先是增進自己的革命理論。中山先生的偉大處，就在他有崇高的理想和革命的理論，他倡導知難行易之說，××××××××××××××××我們尤萬當引爲師法，×××××，提高我們改善教育爲××建國而服務的實踐與趣！</p>
<h3 id="c2">一年來的中國學生救國聯合會 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭代</p>
<p>（本報特訊）中國學生救國聯合會從去年三月在武　開過第二次全國代表大會以後，到現在已經一年多了。這一年來。在政　領導之下，　各界先進扶持之下，無論在前綫或在後方，閱內或國外，都不斷的英勇的爲完成抗戰建國的大業而奮鬥，現在趁着「五四」二十週年紀念的機會，把學聯的幾件重要工作向各界人士及全國同學作一簡單的叙述</p>
<p>一　經當工作</p>
<p>經常工作是指連絡，宣傳，服務，三項日常！作而言，</p>
<p>一，連絡工作爲了加强各地會員團體的聯系，根據代表大會的决議，在各重要的鄰市設　辦事處，同時經常　遣代表赴各地巡視考察，協助當地布置工作，解决問題。</p>
<p>這一年中，新的會員團體時有增加，主要的如新疆的全省學生聯合總會，罵尼刺的中國學生救亡協會，馬來亞的華　　生抗×後援會聯合會，以及上海的學生界救亡恊會等十餘團體。</p>
<p>二，宣傳工作，在國內經常出版刊物，隨時工員各項實傳大綱，工作原則，搜集宣傳資料，分發各地會員團體。響應政府號召，參加各項臨時擬作，主　的如去年的「五四」十九週年　念大會，臺兒　勝利宣傳週，抗戰建國週年紀念宣傳週，保衛武漢宣傳週，「一二八」學牛節三適年紀念大會以及最近舉行的第二期抗戰官傳第二週，國民精神總動員運動等，均適當配合，擬具體辦法，號召各地問學一致工作。</p>
<p>在國際方面，除掉派遣代表赴歐美各國常住宣傳而外，並在國內經集常搜各地靑年學生在抗戰中英勇奮鬥的事蹟，以及其他各神實際的宣傳材料，經通整理編譯之後，經常供給各國駐華通訊社成直寄各國反侵賂的人民團體與文化機關等。此外還訪聞外國來華考察之作家記者，如色斯毛那，司沬特勒，斯諾　特萊女士等人，供給他們不少眞實的材料。</p>
<p>三，服務工作，可以分爲三個主要部份，一個是組織戰地服務團到戰地和×人後方，做戰地服務工作，一個是組織服務團到難民收容所去難民服務工作，一個是同本身職舉業介紹的工作。</p>
<p>二，臨時工作</p>
<p>二，歡迎世界學聯來華代表團。</p>
<p>中國學生在民族解放鬥爭中英勇戰鬥的事蹟，已引起全世界進步人類的問情和敬重，一九三七年八月廿五日世聯代表大會開會，中國學聯派　代表陳權天君出席參加，並向大會提出，請世界舉聯組織　表團到中國來考察。在代表還未動身來華之前，我們卽着手籌備招待他們的工作，並派遣代表到各地，協助當地學聯佈置一切招待工作，前後在香港，廣州，成都，長沙，武漢，重慶，西安昆，明等地，在政府領　之下，聯台當堆靑年學生團體，成立招待委員會，設計擬行一切招待工作，代表團來華以後，使他們得在全國各地受到盛大歡迎舉行擴大演講會及種種座談會等討論世界學運與中國學運中的一些問題。並搜集各地同學實際工作報告，以及種種宣傳材料，最近他們來信，已經把所帶囘的宣傳品編譯整理，運往各國　流展覽，以擴大援華動動。在這　次的招待工作當中，一方面加强了世界人士對我抗戰必勝，建國必成的深切認識，同時也表現出全國同事稍　團結的偉大力量。</p>
<p>二，出席世界靑年和平大會</p>
<p>一九三六年在日內瓦峯行的世界靑年和平大會第一次代表大會，學聯卽派遣陸璀同學代表出席。去年八月十五日復在紐約舉行第二次代表大會。學聯代表陸璀同學又與國內派去，代表合組中國代表團一同出席，中國學聯更由國內直接致函大會主席團致賀。</p>
<p>三，慶祝國參政會首次大侖開幕</p>
<p>國民參政會開幕之先，學聯即派遣代表分訪各參政員，向他們提供許多意見和材料，並上書國民參政會對團結全國學生，動員全國靑年以及有關靑年學生本身的戰時敎育和救濟失業失學等問題，均有詳盡的意見贊献。此外潮南四川等地同學也分別上書參政會，提出切身要求，由此可使政府當局及各界先准，對靑年學生的要求與態度有更加明確的認識，使學生與各方面的聯　更加密切，更能够得到社會人士的同情和指導。</p>
<p>四，保衝武漢的工作</p>
<p>學聯直接響應了政府保衛大武漢的號召。徐在撤　以後就首先發起聯合武漢各民衆團體成立「武漢各團體聯合辦公處」。在武漢　戍總司令部指揮之下，統籌武漢三鎮的保衛工作，關於如何動員學生組織戰時工作隊，如何　散人口，如何組織慰勞團等均有詳細的計劉和佈置，後來都牧郅相當成績。『八一三』週年紀念並聯合武漢各團體，召開靑年參戰大會，發動靑年參加戰時工作。在武漢聚急時期聯合各界組織慰勞團到大化兩岸前綫慰勞。同時在各刊物纷紛遷移之際學聯特別出版，戰時靑年保衛武漢特刊，以資宣傳。一面夜分別派遣代表赴長沙。廣州　桂林，鄭州，洛陽，西安等地發動同學一致努力爲保衛武漢，爭取抗戰勝利血奮鬥。當時各地的徵篡慰勞品，和組織戰地工作團，動員壯了等均有顯奢成績。</p>
<p>五，常委　移　工作</p>
<p>學聯為適應戰時需要，佈置將來工作，一方面留下大部份工作人員長留武漢工作，武漢失守退到豫鄂邊地，担任華中前方及後方工作聯糸。一方面派出代表鄭代　李賡，二人赴西南各省考察，取這長沙，桂林，廣州轉貴陽入重慶，又派代表　甫翔？西北各地考察，取道鄭州，西安，成都　諭。沿送場見堆方畏官。報告學生工作，實　對靑年學生工作意見。拜會各界先進，請求指示，並分訪各團體各學校，徵求工作意見，商討今後方針，搜集工作報告及實際材料。華南戰爭爆發時，學聯代表適在廣州，卽協助當地學牛團體組織戰時工作隊，參加前綫工作。並留常委張艦英同學參加第四戰區聯委會工作以便直接指揮。此外又派代表方練百同學赴東南各省攷察慰間。取道贛，皖，蘇，浙等省轉海道來四川。各地攷察代表先後抵渝，　於去年十一月通告各方，學聯當委會正式移渝辦公辦公。</p>
<p>六，「一二九」三週年紀念大會</p>
<p>常委會移會卽積極籌備『一二九』三週年紀念大會。先由學聯派　代表參加重慶各靑團體聯合座談會，邀請各團體組織「一二九」三週牛紀念籌備委員會。於「一二九」三週年的當天，學聯發告全國同學書刊登各報並印寄各地，與各團體聯名發表紀念宣言，聯合各團體舉行擴大紀念會，參加同學二千餘人，並請陳　長立夫，張申府，鄒韜奮，程希孟等先生蒞會講演，盛况空前，情緒至爲熱烈。</p>
<p>七，献金運動靑年日</p>
<p>三月初新生活運動婦女指導委員會，發起献會運動週，並定三月十二日爲靑年献金日，三月七日由三民主義靑年團邀請各團體共商進行，學聯亦應約參加，恊同工作，惟當時本市各校或放寒假或正進行考試，工作　爲困難，但以意義重大，卽由三靑團取來献　勸捐收據三千五百份，立卽動員全部工作人良，分赴各校連　工作，三日內卽將取來收　如　捐先，所有捐款手續隨即與三靑年團重支麼　郝籌備處辦理淸楚。</p>
<p>八，正在進中的『五四』運動二十週年纪念和　大國民精神總動員運動。</p>
<p>『五四』運動花中國文化史上有着　時代的偉大意義，尤其在實施國民精神總動員　領，社員全民爭取抗戰勝利，建國成功的今天，來紀念「五四」更有着特殊的意義。學聯爲了發揚「五四」的愛國精紳，擴大國民精神總動員運動。響應三民主義靑年團紀念「五四」二十週年的號召，參加各項工作，已擬定具體計劃，正逐步施行中。</p>
<p>三，今後工作</p>
<p>學聯配合當前的具體環境，秉看一貫宗旨，團結同學在政府領導下從事抗戰建國工作。繼續努力。</p>
<p>一。響應政號召，如國民業神總動員運動，深入義　掃除文盲，官傳兵役，慰　出征將士家悜，戰堆服務，獻會義賣等工作。</p>
<p>二，加强國際宣傳，開展國民外交活動。有計劃的搜集材料，供給各國人民國體。必要時派代表赴各國宣傳。</p>
<p>三，展開同學本身服務工作，經常可與同學本身有寗切關係之各項事業或運動。</p>
<p>四，結尾</p>
<p>學聯是學生的團體，希望政府當局隨時指導扶持。學聯是同學自己的團體，盼望各地同學經常帮助和督促。學聯願在</p>
<p>三民主義的旗幟下，</p>
<p>國民政府的領導下，最高領袖指揮之下，爲完成抗戰建國大業而奮鬥。</p>
<h3 id="c3">新四軍敎導營改爲抗戰學院　本月中旬開始招生 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>【上海特訊】新四軍前爲實施訓練辭擊幹部人才起見、曾在皖南總部舉辦大規模教導營一所、專收游擊區內之失學靑年、授以特別之軍事及政治知織、各地靑年聞風前往入學受訓者達一千餘人、期限三個月、畢業後派往各游擊區內担任組織民　訓練民衆等工作、其教育方式採取下列四種、（一）軍事教育、如陣中要令游擊戰術、野外勤務、射擊教範、軍事地　等、（二）課堂教育、如抗戰形勢、訓練民衆、國際問題、中國革命史等、（三）機會敎育、遇育機會、就　行教育、如各種紀　日、學生中臨時發生問題、或國內外發生有意識的消息作爲敎材、運用機會、以實施課外敎育、（四）自我敎　、就是舉生教育學生、如討　會、生活檢對會、座談會　；現閱第一屆受訓靑年卽將畢業、第二屆　決加擴充、改爲抗戰學院、其內部　編制悉順西北之「抗大」一陝公」辦法、預料五月中旬、卽可開始招生、</p>
<p>關於陝甘寗邊區</p>
<p>「補昨日第二版聲明遺漏之處」</p>
<p>又無產生軍閥的基礎。却正相反，這裏的只是一個革命的根據　。但是自己『九一八』後，尤其是在民國二十四年華北事變之後，由於日×侵略的史加深入，民族危機的更加嚴重，所以中國共產黨中央與蘇維埃中央政　共同發了有名的『八一宣言』號召以全國各黨派各階级的抗日救國的統一戰綫來進行抗日民族　命戰爭，在同年十二月十五日，又自動宣佈在蘇維埃政策實行部份的改變，以　進這　號召的費現，這次宣言與蘇維埃政策的部份改變，　取得了全國人民的響應與贊助，民國廿五年西安事變時，中國共產黨擊持和平解決的方針，西安事變和甲解決以後，蘇維埃政府爲了團結全國一致抗日，就正式宣怖取消兩仙政權對立的局面，改蘇維埃工農主專政爲一般的抗日民主政制，（就是現在的邊區政制）。這種爲民族為國家的光明正大仁至義盡的行動與態度，當然合於任何革命法律的基本原則的。不但這樣，任盧溝橋事變後。中國共產黨中央代表還正式同蔣委员長，關於精誠團結共赴國難的問題，有過　分的商討，當時蔣委員長對於改祖蘇維埃政　爲邊區政府，成爲國民政府的組成部份，表示了同意與贊成，而且答應劃延安等縣完全歸邊區政府直接統轄。此後不久，蘇維埃政府卽邀照當時中共中央代表與蔣委員長的共同决定，於九月六日正式更名改制，歸國民政府　　，成為他的一個組成部份。在以後蔣委員長與中共中央代表　次談話中，也屢次承認。</p>

<p>— 姚潛修</p>
<p>【本報特稿】提起「五四運動」，最容易使人想起周恩來先生，這固然由於他是「五四」當年的領導者，但尤其是他自從「五四」以來，二十年如一日的為民族國家的戰鬥精神。他正象徵着他在「五四」時所組織的「覺悟」社，對於人生有了澈底的覺悟。從那時起，就把解放民族的十字架背上，忍受一切艱難困苦，突過萬重險惡環境，終於在抗戰建國中，繼續供献他的熱情力量和偉大的抱負給民族國家。</p>
<p>是「五四」二十週年的前夜，忽然聽到周恩來先生路過桂林的消息，就特爲紀念『五四』，前去訪問他，請他寫文章。</p>
<p>在一間毫無裝飾的房間裏，會到了佩劍　裝的周恩來先生，一個修長適度身材，書生面目，緊毅英明之氣，溢於眉宇，看來有四十歲光景。但顯着很年靑。若近一點兒　視，在眼角上刻下他的戰鬥歷史——有很深的縐紋。我們握手坐定，續有來客，記者便陳明來意。『五四又到了！』周先生略表　嘆之意地說着：「可是，眞沒有時聞寫文章。」接着又這麼否定請求。「哣！五四運動，已經整整二十年了！，是該紀念一下。」周先生略一追憶，這極目語著，似又有爭取時間撰文之意。可是周先生積有許多公事，而來客有增無减又不能久留桂林，顯然希求文章是毫無把握，還是請周先生談談關於「五四」運動吧。</p>
<p>問題被提出之後，周先生雖是談了一些，然而他並沒有充裕的談話時間。這是很可惜的。</p>
<p>「五四運動。包含民族運動，科學與民主運動，新文學運動」。周先生由此開始他對於「五四運動」的評價和指示。「所以可以說，五四運動在當時是思　革命，也是一種啓蒙運動。從運動的發生和展開來說，由北方平雄到南方南京上海廣東，……又從城市到四鄉，影響是很大的。就是孫中山先生的三民主義的全部內容，也是從五四後才漸次完成。不過，五四運動，偏重破壤性，雖然在破壤中建設，但是它的破壞性多過建設性，這在當時是需要的。比如，反對儒家，『一手打倒孔家店』，對於中國文化遺產，不去批評地接受，把一切都加以否定。這在當時，一種新的運動發生，矯枉不免過正，且必然的會過正，然而這并不能减揭它的歷史意義和價値，可是廿年來，中國已有許多進步，就民族運動說，當時的反以日本帝國主義，只不　不訂屆辱條約，保全靑岛等地。現在是全面抗戰了。當時的民主運動，僅是由靑年學生起來打賣國賊，干涉內政外交，至多也不過影響到各界進步份子，起來聲援。現在是全國上下，精誠團結共同担負抗戰建國工作，而且正爲實現民種主義而努力了。至於新文學運動，當時在形式上反對文言，提倡白話，在內容上反對封建意識，要求思想自由。現在，不惟新的文學，已有很多收穫和堅固基礎，就是書的形式，不論詩文戲劇，也都在加入新的內容而普通地被利用着了。此外，還有科學精神之在今日，它的要被重視和使用，那是很　然的，總之：一切都在這證繼發展。我們紀念「五四」應該承強它的積極的優良的傳統，爲民族解放運動，科學和民主運動，發揚它的光榮歷史，以有利於抗戰建國。」周先生一氣講到這事環繞著他的來客，從急躁的表情上似不容再談下去，然而記者終又再請周先生對于抗戰以來的靑年界批評一下，周先生若有所思地說：「不論前方後方，靑年的供獻都很偉大，這種事實，睢也不能否認，不過有些地方靑年，常為二二字句，如中華民國與中華民族解放，或某期與某階段，本來含義相同，他們往往拘於形式主義，因此開會座談發生爭論，甚至引起思想問題，失時誤事，實在是不値得的。」脫到這裏，想一想，又道一，「靑年朋友，還有一點，就是做事喜歡痛快，不問它的影響和結果怎樣，结果反爲不痛快。有時常因個人主觀的痛快，惹出很多麻煩，誤了不少的事。這也是非改不可的。」時間和房裏的形勢，都使記者不能再叩問下去，只好告辭了，我們又緊緊地握手。</p>
<p>歸途，一路上吟味著周先生的談論和指示。</p>
<p>（記者附誌：此文經周先生校正過？內容未曾改動。救亡　社約）</p>
<h3 id="c19">烽火連天的山城 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 圭如</p>
<p>—「五三」「五四」在重慶—</p>
<p>【民革社重慶通訊】血的『五三』是中華民族不容易忘記的日子，然而在這第十一周年「五三」的紀念日，×人故意在舊的創痕上給我們添上了新的烙痕。當人們聽到空中發出警報時，每一張臉上，都反映著忿怒的顏色，每一顆心房，都飽和着民挨的新仇舊恨，</p>
<p>昨天天色異常的晴朗，長空一碧無雲，×機就擁住了這個難得的機會。大批（卅六架）的到來襲擊這座山城——重慶。下午一時廿分左右，就侵入了市空，盲目的沿下城的商業平民區域，濫投重量炸彈和燒夷彈百數十枚。放火後，迅速地向天邊逃逸了。山城裏面佈滿着濃烟。數不淸的火杜直衝雲霄。筆者趕到被害最慘的地區——新豐街，段牌坊，曲四街，左營街，南濟門，大樣子，神仙口，多少　堂變成灰燼，多少馬路頓作瓦史場，千百同胞　時間就丢了寶貴的生命。我心房斎的火也不期然地燃燒起來了。我咀咒着日本××：「五三」這　新舊的血債，總會有一天向你們討還的！</p>
<p>今天「五四』，是中華民族文藝復興的紀念日。×人並不因昨天的殘暴而輕易故過，而且來得更殘酷。重慶的空襲，向例是在午前的，但今天狡猾的日本××，利用着廢曆十五的月夜，竟敢於黃昏六時到來市區肆　。他個投彈的數量，超過昨天兩倍以上：燒夷彈更威烈地發揮着它的強度熱力，着地立卽起火，瞬息間城內的商業繁盛區域和稠密的住宅地帶，像烽火和鞭炮般高幷起來。火數自燃燒到數夜不息，交通完全隔絕。警報解除之後，筆者匆匆走過未被殃及的馬路，看到滿堆着被難同胞從火裏搶出來的零量傢具及散亂的行李箱和包裏。在這上面更仰臥着無數負着身心創　的男女老幼。我無復慰問。事實办不容許我僅作口頭的慰問，因爲　在我的眼前，很多地方正需要着一個年壯力强的靑年去裏力氣。再前進，向著火焰冲天的地方出發。經過組街，鄭郵街上，柴家巷，蓮花池，但見火光融融，照　如同白畫，人頭攢動，或扶受傷者，或挑水，或維持秩序，一般情况，甚差强人憲。</p>
<p>跑到七星崗，半　山地燒得像紅爐一般，縱橫約半里，其中平民住宅不下數百家。今夜，無家可歸的人們，正呆對跳躍着的火球，籌劃他們今夜或明天的歸宿地。</p>
<p>在「五三」，『五四』之前，×機雖會光顧過這座山城，但人們畢竟是惰性動物，因爲沒有看見什麼了不得的火災，他們就連當局數月　所頒佈的疏散人口命令，都忽略掉。到今大定有不少人追悔着。他們的大意與執拗，確可責備；但地們的勇氣，實可使人流淚。就華者所見這次身受　家蕩產的人們，咸把他們的怨頂集中在暴×身上。他（或她）們，不分男女老幼，在萬劫餘生的當兒，仍熱烈地撝護政府實現抗戰到底的决心。「老子，××××××一這是筆者隨時隨地都能聽到的山人對暴×咀咒的惯用。　（五月四日）</p>
<p>【民革社五日晨重慶快訊】四日下午五時，×機四十六架空　重慶，第一次警報發出後，但見我機盤垣空際防護，迄四，分鐘後，始突發緊急警報，×機廿餘架先至，經劇烈之空戰後，偷襲進市空，在商業中心區及文化中心區之興隆街，都郵街，蒼坪街，紫家巷，七星岡，關顧街，領事巷，會仙極等臨處，倉皇掉下炸彈九百枚，其中並有燒夷彈甚多。一時各街起火燃燒，延燒至深夜未熄，商業文化，盡付一炬。無　市民，死傷無法計算。×機於投彈後，卽行逸去。至五日晨三時，復發出空　書報，平民從睡夢中驚醒，慌忙扶老攜幼奔逃，惟未發緊急警報。至四時卽解除警報，市民亦紛紛囘家　覺。昨日焚燒餘燼，刻仍未盡滅，全市救護，防護，消防人員及三民主義靑年團團員等，均在積極搶救罹災市民中。今日本市頗形茺凉，各無固定職業之市民，均陸積搬往附近各鄉村，×機一連兩日狂炸本市，其慘無人道之×佳，已暴露無遺矣。</p>

<p>— 廖崇聖</p>
<p>就原料言，該國最感缺乏者，磁爲鐵與煤油。以言煤油，其平時消費，年約五百萬噸。國內供給，充其量亦不過二百萬噸，而戰時消耗。因機械之充分運用，據專家之估計，最低限度亦須三倍或四倍於平時，亦即年耗一千五百至二千萬噸之關。是其本國之供給，僅敷戰時消費百分之十或百分十五耳。若夫，羅馬尼亞之油田，如該國得而獨占之，固未嘗不可以大舒其困。誠以羅國煤油年產之最高記錄曾達八百七十萬噸（一九三六年），約足供其戰時消費之半。不過如蘇俄能繼英國之後，予羅國之獨立以保證，則德國全部控制羅馬尼亞之大悉，能否如願以償，誠為一大疑問也。况羅國縱供　策，其供給仍未琢用乎？</p>
<p>以言鐵之供給，因亞　洛林二省重關法國之故，今之德國更瞠乎威謙二世時之後。最近該國鐵之輪入，年還二千萬噸。多數來自法國與瑞典。年來除積極開發其國内蘊藏外，其期望於南斯拉夫者至殷，蓋該國　藏　豐故也，惟鐵　之用發，手續後夜，需時冗長，弗若推進國際鎬易之輕而易舉。據股近統計，該國產煙；每年尚不及一百萬順之數。，是以一旦西歐之來源中斷，荀非經過相當之陽關時關，欲求南國全郃解决其鐵之需要，這不當木求魚耳！</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3 id="c33">英國的聯蘇抗日運動 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>據昨日晚報戰，「蘇聯對英保證外交政策並無變更」，「英國對蘇反提議可以成立諒解基礎」，於是證明了『英蘇合作之門未閉』。</p>
<p>蘇聯外交政策之不致因李維諾夫之辭　而有所變更。這是我們早已明確指出，不必等待蘇聯提出保證，當已有天下所共喻的。一切唯恐天下不亂的　人，少數甘心為日×漢好利用的記者，連日竟蘇李維諾夫辭獲一事而大造　言，對蘇聯大肆詆責，甚至謂蘇德外交關係將有新的發展。此等人的靈論，固然不値一駁，但是他們造　或衆以圖動搖正義人士對蘇聯之信任，這一點是我們所不應忽視的。</p>
<p>現在德意軍事同盟正式成立，日本與德意的勾結亦似將有進一步的表現，我們對於這種外厲內荏的勾結的力量，不必作過高的估計，但是也正可作爲英國過去不澈底的聯蘇反侵略政策一種無情的跺　；而希特勒莫案里尼，亦正想用這種勾結的力量，××××××××××，這不僅為熟悉國際時事的人士所能　見，亦爲英國慶大民衆和其政府中較有誤見的人士所引以爲危的。所以從今日報國國際電訊中卽可看到英國上下一致。正在推進聯蘇抗日運動。工黨議員潘恩氏及自由黨領袖路易喬治，對此種運動，贊助尤力，路易喬治還明切主張：英國與蘇聯成立一種協定，他說：「德意可以動員二倍於英法波三國所能動員之軍隊的總婁，若無蘇聯之合作，則英國對波，羅，希各國的保證將無實踐可能　」他又說日本現在遠東作稱細企圖，在前次大戰時，英國會自印度獲得一百萬之援軍，而法國亦自安南調動五十萬人，倘無蘇聯之援助，而又有日本此一敵人在東方，吾人如何可以真補此等空隙？」</p>
<p>我們深信祇有英國聯蘇抗日和德意才能拯救英國於法四斯侵略者的包圍之中，祇有英國領導聯蘇抗日和德意，才能好救整個世界於法西斯侵略者的毒焰之中，不過現在英國政府尙未積極採取此種致策。而法西斯侵略者之陰謀活動則更加猖狂，全世界無論何處，都將找不到一片安靜的土地，所以我們目前對於那些站在　路上對和平　士放冷箭的妄人興論客，那　甘心為侵略者日×澳奸利用的份子，要有痛豐仇恨之心，而且還要推進　論，推動全世界正義人士，促進英蘇合作，促進反侵略綫。</p>

<p>— 希明</p>
<p>「抗戰特輯」盛況空前　觀眾情緒熱烈為他片所未有</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>中國製片廠派遣大批攝影師深入各戰場　取「抗戰特輯一的目的，完全是爲了將整個在抗戰中進步的中國，介紹給國內外同胞，以及國際間關心中國的友人。政府之所以創辦　廠，並且由軍事委員會政治部直接監製該廠出品，當然是有着偉大意義的。</p>
<p>「抗戰特輯第六集」此次在中央戲院公演，為求香港同胞能够普遍的一看該片起見，特別訂了許多辦法，如（一）減低座價，（二）增加場數，每天自十二時半至九時五十分連演六場，（三）特別優待學界參觀，（四）通用半價券等等。而這種「求普遍」的辦法，也正是政府要出資製片的原因，它可以把抗戰整個史實紀錄下來，而發揮它廣大的宣傳力量。</p>
<p>據記者調查所得，該片第一日公演的結果，六場滿座，雖然把座價減低，牧入仍達一千七百餘元之鉅。可見觀衆之擁擠，可見香港同胞對於祖國抗戰之關切。觀者雖然只出了很少的錢，來看這一部抗戰影片，但這很少的錢積聚起來，便又可以攝製許多抗戰片，使我們可以不斷地得到『精神上的食糧」。</p>
<p>「抗戰六輯」公演的第一天，適値五七，而昨天又値五九，在這個國恥日，來看這部　戰的影片，尤其是可紀念的事情。這一天中央戲院特別商得中國片廠的同意，把日場所得的收入，完全獻給政府，所以觀衆越見踴躍，成績之好，更出乎意料之外，該款今日已交中國銀行匯出。</p>
<p>香港製片家及戲院一般的意見，以爲『國防片不實錢』，換言之，卽觀衆不歡迎。但中國製片廠所攝製的『八百壯士』『熱血忠魂』以及「抗戰特輯」一至五集，在香港及南洋公演的結果，成績都非常之好。可以反証『國防片是受觀衆歡迎的，不過是要愼重而嚴肅和有內容的國防片。』</p>
<p>尤其値得提出的，是觀衆的情緒，當觀衆在「抗戰特輯」裏看到「我軍大捷」，「軍民合作」，「孤軍升旗」，「×人被俘』。……等等不勝其數的場面，那種不可遏制的熱情，使全院掌聲不停，興為萬狀，這種情况。是「非國防片」所沒有的，是戲劇技巧所不能造成的。</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>這是漫　作家給一個迷途的伙伴的信：</p>
<p>『××同志：</p>
<p>不幸得很，當我們的眼睛讀到你在漢奸報上發表漫書作品，我們怎樣替一個曾經爲漫盡而鬥爭的勇士痛惜呢！</p>
<p>同志，這囘簡直使人不會相信你會脫　我們的隊伍，因爲你有過去光榮的歷史，在上海，你亦會和我們一起幹過反侵略的工作。同志，那時你是多麽的努力，但現在，我們怎樣爲你的前送傷心呢！你還是那麽年輕地正是爲祖國生存而鬥爭的時候，可是你放棄了，你放棄了你的生命，你放棄了你的親戚朋友，你似乎忘記了正義，良心的字義了。同志。這些事，亦許不是你自己的意思吧？我個明白，因為你太孤單了，黒暗的氣氛正包圍著一個不會找光明的你，</p>
<p>同志，你應該告訴我們，放下你的近視鏡吧，坦白地說出你人生的憧，你應該想想，你是一個中國人，是一個有藝術性　的鬥士，我們正候侯你回到我們的隊伍，只要你能夠清醒。</p>
<p>你回來吧，親愛的同志。我們實存不顧意少了你，但，你何以顧意少了我們？你告訴我們吧！你是為了生活被人欺騙嗎？或是你自顧放棄往日的歷史？我們很想得個明白。</p>
<p>現在，我們全體靜餱你的回音，請你不要輕視大衆的好意！宋了，祝你覺悟。</p>
<p>漫孫工作者業淺予，張光宇，黃鼎，黃苗子，陳烟橋，李凡夫鄭家鎮，小丁，諫憲崎，林擒，</p>
<p>二八，五，二，」</p>
<p>從這封信的字裏行間看來。我們充分了解我們的書家是這樣前進，這樣忠誠！懇切勸勉迷涂的伙件囘頭的作風，又何曾不是一個個得效法的榜樣！敬禮！我們的書家！</p>
<p>這次，全國浸協香港分會集了全國浸盡傑作五十餘人幅在中央戲院舉行書展，在意識方面我們早已信仰在前，實地參觀之後，更是連連叫絕。「西行浸記」作者斯諾Ndgor　Now氏在參觀了四月卅日的預展之後說：『……它描出了中國多方面的鬥爭，它證明中國的』藝術陣線」是中國軍事陣線的堅强後盾，是値得贊助的」這實在是很多人的共嗚，沒有一點兒的誇張與强諷。</p>
<p>在抗戰的鬥爭中，我們什麽都在生長，什麼都在進步。藝術作品不僅沒有例外，而且是作爲嚴肅，活潑的一員，是衣情意意挺有效力的工具。</p>
<p>記者擠在參觀的人羣中深深搜嘆每一輻各有獨到之處。「×××××××××××××××××表現普×××的政縛。有一位好姊姊指著『×××××××××』的一幅替她的弟弟解釋，弟</p>
<p>弟天眞地大喊起來，大跳起來，這實在是應該接受的敎育。</p>
<p>「男當乓，女耕耘，××生產保中華」背景是轟炸之後，人物是姊弟二人挺身前進的『我們祇有一條路——鬥爭』，不僅是活生生地反映現實，而且在藝術方面寫出新女性的美是反　揉造作的囘到自然去。那是多美　，多可愛！</p>
<p>「×××××××××××××××××！」和平之餌「使人慘氣連民主國家亦竟上了×人的勾當，這勾當，難道沒有一天給全世界的人士揭穿嗎？</p>
<p>「另一種人」的意思很深癡。要加以思索才得了解、超然暢飲壓機人家的鮮血的這「一種人」不知看了作何感想？『等於殺人』的一輻亦是須加思索的</p>
<p>「淦民血」使人一掬困情之裂，「××××」原來如此這般，忍受—忍受正如『光榮的負傷』一樣我們的明天就不是昨天了。</p>
<p>『兵愛民，民助兵，×××××××』，亦是活生生事實的寫照，是偉大的中國從歷史中勞練出來的奇蹟。看了真使人無限欣喜，無限感奮！</p>
<p>蔣委員長和汪精衛二幅書象的對比尤其有力。前者是慈祥的英姿，背景是旗國，上前線的將士及英美法蘇的國旗，題着「勝利的啓示」眞是再好沒有了，汪精衛呢？××××××××××××××××××，靠近看看作者究竟題什麽字句？嗤！原來是『舉一個例！』</p>
<p>還有很多幅眞是說不盡，講不完，反對隔離現實的「花鳥虫魚山水仕女」的藝術作品是成功的藝術作品，是上面信裏的意識的具　反映。它的前途像抗戰一樣光明，這些作品，已經從印刷機與畫本跳到大福白布和鄕村的　壁上，從有閒的欣賞　爲民族鬥爭的前鋒了，她踏通了前絲，後方，農村，都市了，我們　　她『洗舉』還要送她『遠行』，記者在這裏粗枝大葉的報道只是寫出這個　展的一小部份而已。今天是　展最末的一天，讓讓者自已去欣賞吧！</p>

<p>【上海通訊】不久前在關心大戰過演院歌劇「卡門」的歐亞劇藝公司，最近有猜大組織的計劃。這個計劃包括除原有法國的歌劇赴之外，還打算自己建造一個戲院，組織一個中國的歌劇團體。和設立一個中國歌劇班。</p>
<p>這個計劃不僅將是確，中兩歌劇的基礎的先鋒，幷且也將是鞏固幷擴大上海括劇的有力者。因為他們的計劃中，那座國際大劇院以後也將經常的上演話劇。這中嘆息著沒有舞台的劇運者，以後將有很大的方便，何部戲院的建造旣是為了上演歌劇和話劇；種種設德，當然也皎之現在借電影院上演老要完備得多。</p>
<p>這些計劃次　實行的時期，歐亞劇藝公司的名稱也將改一改，新的名稱經　决定，　做國際劇藝公司，國際則藝公司名義，下的各種組織，雖然各個都相當的保持其獨立性，但名稱上則都冠以『國際』一字。</p>
<p>其計劃大致如下。</p>
<p>（一）外國歌劇班　就是不久前在關心上演「卡門」的那個班子，最近將到西實，河內等處去旅行表演一下，他們的代表勒皮高（LeBibot）已經動身去接洽了。這個旺子的計劃是先在西　河內。上海一個地方建立起經常公演的據點。以後可以輪流上演，在內部的組織上，也想先以法國人爲中心把它加强起來，然後再吸牧中國人，或其他國籍的人士作補充，他們這次往表演，除河內西貢外。大　還得到爪哇新加坡一帶去漏漏險。</p>
<p>（二）國際大劇院　這個大劇院正在積極進行中。地迠已决定，在法租界高貴戲院區域中，鬧中收靜，交通也敬方便，現在是在起草圖樣中，預計是本年中落成，不久後卽公開募股戲院的建築，因準德上演歌劇和話劃之用，所以後台及舞台設備將，過一切現有的戲院。</p>
<p>（三）中國歌劇班　這個歌劇團體現在已大體糾織好了，劇本也在寫作中，社址劇名，參加者的名單，現在暫守秘密。一待時機成熟再報告。</p>
<p>中國歌劇團體的演員，雖决定全用新人，（以免和話劇的人員衝突，而使人力分散，）但為了訓楝新的幹部起見，他們又决定設立一個歌劇訓練　。招收有志於歌劇的靑所來加以訓練，作爲將來欲劇運動發展時的生力軍，我們看過「罌粟花」，我們是相信中國歌劇會有其無　的前途的，那麽在目前先把基本部隊訓練起來，省得將來鬧人才茺，實在也是當務之急。</p>
<p>歌劇運動在向前發展中，國際劇藝公司各項計劃的相綱實行，則將是它的先鋒</p>
<p>這是一個可喜的消息。我相信讀者們一定會得到這個消息而高與的，</p>

<p>（本報專訊）公開草地網球賽、今天午後上演的是歷軸戲、由徐家兄弟（煒培潤培）與何家流李汝榮作變打爭標戰、</p>
<p>徐家兄弟乃刻下本港港球界中技中水準最高的兩人、故在單打寶方面、已包辦冠亞兩軍、對於　打、他倆　聯冠軍呼聲亦至高、</p>
<p>是屆賽會中、參加單打及變打的人數比往昔特多、　然一個好現象、競　到了最後階段、我華人好手、均脫頴而出、把所有洋人淘汰出局、演成包辦單雙打冠亞兩軍的優良局面、創一頁得未會有的光榮史、</p>
<p>何李二人、在壓倒林珍兄弟一役中、均有佳作、當日何氏演出的優點、乃常能穩守底線、應付杯珍兄弟的撇擊、而其左右角度長抽的技術、　著豐富的經驗、時時施展出來、顯見得已恢復當年英勇了、至於李氏演出的好處、最值得稱贊的是網前　　、精伶活潑、在在足以制林珍兄弟的死命、其個人技術、確在嶺峯狀態中、又與何氏合作得異常默契、彼　此退、位置得宜、絕無互相弄出錯誤之弊、故能淘汰林珍兄弟獲得决　權、並非倖致、乃技術超凡所應有的收穫、</p>
<p>今天與徐氏兄弟遭遇、如其演出的仍有戰林珍兄弟時一樣精彩、那末、徐氏兄弟雖挾去屆冠軍聲威而來、恐亦不易取勝的、</p>
<p>何李二人在未戰勝林珍兄弟之前、或尙無若何奢望、旣淘汰林珍兄弟之後、奪標雄心便跟着大起來了、所以今天此役、一方則欲保持冠軍、無捐威名、一方則欲　登寶座、稱孤道嘉、而且何李二人旣有去週的　作、自信之心更强、雖則徐家兄弟的本領、非比等閒、然何李二人已達到這個爭標地位、則必以盡其所能、以資應付、如若得勝、固無限光榮、卽使失敗、亦亞車在手、因是之故、在他兩姑無論所得　軍或亞軍、都已認　滿足的酬報、反之、徐家兄弟正在黃金時代、又欲保存令譽、今見何李二人異軍突起、知非易與、剛巧相逢、自不無患得患失之心、對於勝負問題、亦定比何李二人　加重視、因爲恐怕偶有一失、不特前功盡棄、而數屆威名也不保了、故此在今天的競賽中、可料定徐家兄弟求勝之心、必比何李二人更切、</p>
<p>以雙方校術輸、任雙都曉得徐家兄弟較佳、又合作多年、國得諒解之妙、而且大徐那種剛柔　施的絕技、無論對任何勁敵、他都能盡量發揮出來、取得按制對方的地位、故我認為何李二人所採的韌性戰略、用以對付林珍兄弟則有餘、對付徐家昆　則不足、至網前扣壓及底綫撇擊諸技、徐家兄弟亦無不勝一籌、如此這般、都是他倆把握着勝利的重要條件、</p>
<p>總之、此幕鏡賽、必展開至多精彩的局面、値得欣賞的、</p>

<p>昨戰廣大勞動、鄭煜棠表演最佳、　擊頗見工夫、籃底投射亦送有佳作、梁宣昭、梁仁强、尤每能予前鋒以輸送、頗見出色、而全隊利用迂迴遞傳、避免對方强奪、則為致勝之因、</p>
<p>警察因拿、星缺場、攻勞遠遜、昨軌雖裏有會廷開陳錦奎之遠射中的、然究不可靠、巴寶星進攻退守、雖未殝佳妙、但已為警察建下不少之功、其餘諸子、祇可稱强有力、而技術究未見佳、且各員每各自這蟈、　在核心時、尤不肯將球傳交、致被對方集中抵抗、力阻二人、此寶為該隊之致命傷、戰略上之失算、無可　言、禰靠強幹、於事終無濟也、末塲乙租廣中對大中、結果廣中以卅二比廿四勝、餘甲組一塲成績如下、</p>

<h3 id="c67">文藝反攻 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 朱里</p>
<p>抗戰已經進入一個新階段。在第二期的抗戰中，我們已經决定固守每一個後方的城，在淪陷的戰區裏發動更廣泛的游擊戰爭，更配合着各路的正規軍，全線施行反攻。在政治上則積極廓淸腐化的動搖抗戰信心的分子，打擊一切陰謀者和所謂「文化漢奸」。這樣，抗戰的第二期是積極的，在軍事和政治策略上，準備施行反攻。</p>
<p>文藝旣被認爲武器之一種，旣被認爲有着宣傳効用的，而且事實上，文藝可以配合在任何一種戰鬥襄。那宋，反映這神聖的民族解放戰爭的文藝　應從正面從側面給這大時代留下現實的記載，當然更應以配合到反攻戰鬥裏邊去了。這自然是一個文藝工作者的責任，至少業應該是一個文藝工作者所注意着的。我們在一切可能範國內，要增强抗戰的力量！</p>
<p>我們更可從×方的文藝實動中、得到一個護明，我們是不龍个增强我們的文藝的戰門力量。我們的×人並未放棄把文藝當作戰門對象的一貨策略。「華威先生」的屍首運到日本去雖然是可笑可恥的，但是我們不能再茫若無視了，我們迫切　　需要文藝工作者的動員組織堅强的對立陣綫，而且立刻反攻過去，配合着反攻的軍事的和政治的策略。</p>
<p>敵國的文士已經在軍刀下動員起來，接受着軍部的豢養也接受着軍部的「意納」，一批批送到中國的戰地上來了。　着祖克車，飛機和侵略軍隊而來的「筆部隊」將需產生大量的「說謊文學」（說縣和文學是一個頗篇複雜的論題，然而這襄所謂說謊文學顯然是另有所指的）是當然的事。</p>
<p>但尾隨着侵略軍隊而來的侵略的筆，無法把橫暴曲解和平，把霸道曲解為正義也是當然的事，一條　在衫子下的尾巴將有掉下來的一天。</p>
<p>我們的為正義而戰的戰爭已經獲得寳貴的國際同情，也穫得國際的支持，同機配合在正義的戰鬥裏的文藝也將獲得同樣的同情和支持。這是個絕對的優勢。我們應該保持着遭優勢，在抗戰進入了包括着更多積極性的現在，配合着反攻的部餘，向着爲侵略而來的「筆部隊」反攻過去。</p>
<p>直到那些侵略部隊，以及隨在後面的筆部隊被反攻得潰敗，滾出去為止。</p>
<h3 id="c68">父子之間 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>陸有德舉竟是老了。別人雖然說他身體還很强儘。可是他自已卻不願冉在外面混。凡是以前替人做的保，一慨登啓事辭去；就連甚麽慈善救難會聘請他担任董事的名義，他也一口咬定地辭掉。</p>
<p>『這年頭……總是少一件事好一點！』他常常這樣說。</p>
<p>眞的，自從中日戰事發生之後，陸有德整個的變了模樣：他衹打算怎樣能安穏地坐在家裏過一輩子「老爺」的生活便滿足了，當然囉！這種主意可沒算錯。他有的是房屋，僕役和銀錢，自然沒缺少什麽，也不再需要些甚麽的。</p>
<p>陸德有一位太太。曾被那眞鐵筆大相士讃過一番說是宰而她的眉毛沒生少一根，所以將來一定是「後福無窮」的。怪不得她的身體簡直是胖得像一條老母猪，沒有福氣的人怎配？</p>
<p>這是許久以前的事了。現在呢？陸太太　下來兒子也已經十七歲啦！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>陸　宗完全不像他的老子，至少不比陸有德那般怕事。</p>
<p>陸有德閉緊大門在家過那淸閒的生活底時候，他的兒子却當選了學生救亡會的勸募組主任。陸有德是做夢想不到自已的兒子竟會這機「膽大家為」的。當耀宗舍笑的將一冊募捐薄　到父親的手襲，有　看完了之後，突然變了嚴厲的聲調說道：</p>
<p>「大毛！你瘋了麼？」</p>
<p>「不！父親，這是每偶國民應盡的責任：有錢出錢！有力出力！我希望父親多捐一點。」</p>
<p>「大毛！你眞是愈大愈糊塗，現在時局這樣下去……還不知甚麽時候才平定……大家總要節省些才對，那裏還有多餘的錢去捐，甚麽，大毛，原來你還勸莫主任，那還了得，一家人的性命都要被你送掉了。哼！這捐册上面有你的具名，要是發生了甚麽事故我可担當不起起……　，其實你也太沒　筋了，家　會的，穿的，那一樣缺了你的，怎麽偏不安分却去幹那危險和沒出息的玩意？……」</p>
<p>「爸爸，你說够了沒有，聽我說——」</p>
<p>「混帳！你還要來挺撞我？」</p>
<p>「爸爸！你不捐也就算了，何必多話，要是做你這樣有錢的人還捨不得伞錢出來，中國　快……」</p>
<p>「畜生！快住嘴！」</p>
<p>「呼！自已不愛國却不許別人愛國，那才算是有妥筋？別做夢！亨福的日子不能過一輩子的。別以爲有錢就可以……」</p>
<p>「畜生！你居然罵起我來了？快和我滾出去里！」有德氣到臉色由紅紫變成蒼日</p>
<p>經過這一塲吵嘴，以後他父子倆就是遇見的時候，也不交談一句話。耀宗表面似乎很平靜，其實　地裏工作得比以往還要起頸。有德呢？整天在家裏拍桌踢　的大駡，可是沒有人理會他。</p>
<p>有一天，有德總算把怒氣平息了。他把兒子親親熱熱地喚到房裏來。</p>
<p>「大毛！你這樣大了還不知道孝順嗎？為甚麽要和你的爸爸作對，要知道我教訓你也不過想你學好罷了。你想，世界上那有老子不愛惜兒十的道理。希望你自己不要使爸爸難過才是啊…」</p>
<p>「爸爸！我很了解你的處境和你的一番話。不錯，在家庭的立埸來說，你的餂並沒有說　。但是，以整個國家的立場而言，你不應該使用你的私心把兒子强留在家裏的。」耀宗說話時兩限充滿了神聖的光芒。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>兒子是和那故在權裏的穴百元同時失踪的。而且，都是永遠不囘來的。</p>
<p>爲了這件事，有德又圖了好幾天的脾氣。對着陸太太便這樣萬道：</p>
<p>「都是你這老不死的才會生出這種好兒子！」</p>
<p>聽了丈夫的實為，陸太太方始對十幾年來牢認在心中的那一勾「後福無窮」的話起了大大的疑團。</p>
<h3 id="c69">孩子見地 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 聞歌</p>
<p>針對著『游來游去』的亡國　　，便來了一個實施國民的精神繼動員的通電。這等於淸夜的　聲驚觀了迷夢中的人們二般，是極有意義的。尤其是在這南方孤島的香港，更應該鄭重地注實著了。本來，想精神總動員僅是最低限度的愛國標準，論理每個中國人似乎不必等人提　就早該自動履行；但事實上却一定要蔣委員長通電後方才理會到，這在我民衆是多麽感到慚愧的一件事啊！</p>
<p>現在；這精神總動員的實施已在熱烈地宣傳中了，大部份民衆也已對於這動員有了相當的認識。可是—却不能諱言，實際上還祇側重於識字的知識人零中；至於知識水準比較次的和甚至不職字的羣衆，至少我敢說還沒有多大的影響發生。雖然他們不會使因精神動員影響不到而個個做出喪心病狂的賣國行為，但對於勝利信念的懷疑論者却不能說絕對沒有。因此，我們要撲滅這種富目式懷疑論者的毒素起見，不僅要側重於所謂上層的知識份子宣傳，更要進一步深入到所謂下曆的無知識的羣衆間的宣傳，使全國民衆不分上下屋都能明瞭精神總動員的根本意　而急起實行。要發到這一點。我們也不能單有表面上的文字上的宣傳，而應該盡量利用別種較好的方法。因為文字上的宣傳是對於知識份子而發的，在不識字的民衆除了看到幾許方方正正的字以外，當然一無所知。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，也許有人會說，「精神總動員還是最近方才提起，何必這樣躁急呢？」但我却以為這動員原在抗戰開始時使該實施的，竟捱到現在，雖不能說遷，也不能說還早，當然不能再從從容容走著方歩做去。所惟雙管齊下是必然的事實，何况現在汪派和其他賣國者都在以巧妙的反間計蛭弄着民衆，我們决不能坐視他們東實西　的白日橫行，惟有以精神總動員來迎頭膺　，我想這無論如何是該如此做的</p>
<p>總之：關於精神總動員，有相當知識的人可以不用遲疑而立卽實行，若再要有人宣傳方肯硬了頭皮去做，那這人似乎太不中用。所以我以爲動員的宣傳最正確的對象應該是知識不及水準的民衆。</p>
<p>最後，我謹以至誠希望每一個了解精神總動員的　義的先生們：設法抽取你們的空睱時間為我們的知識不及水凖的羣衆宣傳這問題的一切。尤其是我們這些　居在孤島上的「幸福的」島民，眼前似乎不受甚麽驚嚇，無疑更應該為這事出一點力。</p>
<p>努力吧，努力發揚我們爭取自由的精神。</p>
<p>我是一個孩子，孩子的見地是會使人們笑痛肚皮的，好在大人先生們大約不會計較甚麽，我謹在這裏告個罪。</p>
<h3 id="c70">山城（續） <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 茜菲</p>
<p>「天氣今年也變了，這麽個天時，會下起雪花來」，老伯伯曲着冷變了的腰。</p>
<p>城內，應用的東西一攤攤的擺在大街上，用不着什麽標記，自然是十足的地道貨：綠得十分可愛的瓷碗，小花瓶，鹽底白花的土布，像一個，小碗似的黃　，還有竹編的藍，草織的　，麥桿的蓆，一切農人辛苦勞作出來的東西，都陳列出來了。</p>
<p>人在叫，馬在嘶，牲口偷得了片刻空閒，自由的嚼着綠草，沒有草吃的，便安份的站過一角去。</p>
<p>瘦削的豬；擊在職繼裏，給屠人牽着發出可怕的哀叫，老主人用愛憐的目光送過去，豬賣了，換來的是寥寥幾張鈔票，他悵惘地拍着馬背，用温　的氣息温暖着牠，馬臺服地倚傍着主人的身畔。</p>
<p>小食館子和　在街邊的小食，可熱　極啦，火爐紅紅的燃燒着，食品騰着熱氣。</p>
<p>五分銀羊肉，再來一角黃酒，好禦一下身上的塞氣。一個米線，一碗土麵，於是店老板就忙碌不過了。或者買　個鋼板豆腐，豬血，也可以飽吃一頓了。</p>
<p>「昨天省城被炸呢」。沒有比這消息史使他們注意的了，無綫電前，重重圍了許多人。</p>
<p>「打下三架敵機！」年靑夥子高興的叫。</p>
<p>他們於是很滿足地走開去。戰爭對他們還很遠呢。</p>
<p>灰暗的天，有點陰悽慷的，山城的城市漸漸靜下去了，農人拖着馬兒，流向城外表。冷風，正在郊外的松林，在閃光的湖水上掠過他們發抖的身體。憔悴的蹣跚着的人羣，沒入田邊小徑去。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c71">滿洲的雪 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>隨着，他們便不自禁地，像歡迎雨文一樣地把她置起來，在空中搖搵：使　笑，不得暢快的笑，使她呼叫，不得自然的呼叫，更不得自由的呼吸，一切的動作，都不得自主。他們把她　擺得幾乎暈呟，才停止下來。她疲　了，巳經站立不起；她躺在床上，初黨着同志的愛，比家族的感情更親。這是她在人生的路上，第一個溫暖的夢。</p>
<p>「……你們都是我的哥哥，也許有我的弟弟，我怎樣呼喚你們呢？……我不能離開你們，不能呀！……如朵我身邊沒有了你們，還能有誰呢？……我不能離開你們，不能呀，不能呀，我願你們生死在一起，永遠在一起！……雨文，你怎麽這樣呆呢？……眞呆呀，眞呆呀，你是世界上第一個呆人！……你爲什麽還要用手槍？……眞呆！……你偷倫寫一封信，明白點兒告訴我，多好呀……呀！我不是立刻就來了嗎？……你看你還受了刀傷……刀傷！……你不要怨我，這都因為你呆！……不，你們都呆呀！呆呀！……不，我也呆，我爲什麽要撞你一刀？……我呆！……」</p>
<p>——她在那夢中，興奮得失常。這時，她躺着，合　着眼睛，兩手交叉在胸脯，不動一動。她的臉上還有一種滿意的微笑，像照片上的笑影，永不改變，也不消退。</p>
<p>他們逐着她那迷茫的狀態，又把舉到空中，繼續搖擺。他們要在繼續的搖擺中，把自己對她的熱情權續向她傾注無遺為止。</p>
<p>她被搖擺得失知而忘形，任隨身體一時高起，一時低落，一時揭來，擺去，任隨如何地弄玩。在那農玩中，高　，聖潔，不需要她有着不必要的願慮；她已經忘肥了人的性別——不自由的隔膜。她不想拒絕，也似乎唯有這樣，地才感到不會有過的快樂。現在，她知道了，眞的快樂，珍貴的　得。縱然有人快樂得二生，也難抵她這一刹那的快樂——如果可能長到永遠，她惟外，世界難再有快樂的人。</p>
<p>不過，她　　的時候，仍然像昨夜一　未睡。這未　的原因，並不是被昨夜二擭的情諸所　擾；人的快樂。有時快樂得失眠。</p>
<p>屋內的燈光，花瓶的花朶，以及所有的東西，都是快樂的，都在防着她的眼睛，格外的淸瀧。於是，　　閉了眼睛，　　外的氣零之聲給她催眠。</p>
<p>兩點鱸以後，她睡着了。（六一）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Improving Overseas Chinese Education Problems <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese nation is at a critical juncture of survival or extinction. If ×× wins, the nation will achieve independent survival and freedom. If ×× fails, the country will perish, and all ethnic groups in China will inevitably become slaves forever. The lives of overseas Chinese will also be unimaginable! Therefore, today we must concentrate all our efforts and resources to serve ×× and seek ×× victory. Cultural and educational undertakings are, of course, no exception, and overseas Chinese cultural and educational undertakings are especially no exception. This is common sense and needs no further explanation. However, overseas Chinese cultural education in various places is mostly disconnected from the domestic education system due to special circumstances, especially in relation to the current ×× nation-building cause. The impact this has on the ×× nation-building cause is truly unbearable to contemplate! This is also common knowledge for every conscientious and far-sighted overseas Chinese educator, and it needs no further explanation. Our current problem is how to implement improvements in overseas Chinese education based on the special circumstances of various places, so that it can adapt to the needs of today's motherland in ×× nation-building and contribute to the overall liberation of the Chinese nation. We would like to contribute our views here for the reference of those who are promoting the improvement of overseas Chinese education.</p>
<p>First, we should clearly understand the educational policies that the motherland urgently needs to implement at present. The Kuomintang's ×× nation-building outline once revealed that the basic principles for improving education at the moment are: "Revise the education system and teaching materials, promote wartime courses, focus on the cultivation of national morality, improve scientific research, and expand its equipment. Train various specialized technical personnel and allocate them appropriately to meet ×× needs. Train young people to serve in war zones and rural areas. Train women to serve in social undertakings to increase ×× strength." The supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, also said in his instruction to the National Education Conference: "In the current era, whether it is an individual or a society, if it does not practice wartime life, it cannot survive and will be eliminated and reduced." At the same time, he remotely instructed the national education community, saying: "If we want to build our country into a modern country, we need tens of thousands of specialized scholars, hundreds of thousands or even millions of technicians and engineers in various departments, and even more millions of teachers and mass training cadres. These all need to be supplied by our education community." ×××××××××××× Third, after we understand the educational policies and the direction of educational improvement that the motherland urgently needs at present, we must consider the actual situation in various places and do everything we can to achieve the goals that the motherland expects of us. We must strive to ensure that overseas Chinese education can adapt to the current urgent needs of the motherland, and at the same time, focus on the following points in the education process: (1) Cultivate national consciousness, enhance the national self-esteem of overseas Chinese, and promote the emotions of supporting ×× and the confidence that ×× will surely win and the nation will surely be built. To realize this requirement, it is necessary to strengthen political education, study social sciences, and hold collective discussions on the political situation. Because only by enabling overseas Chinese youth and people from all walks of life ×××××× to have a deep understanding can their will be truly firm. (2) Enhance the concept of the nation and the country, so that every overseas Chinese recognizes the loveliness of the country and the greatness of the power of the entire nation. To realize this requirement, encourage the pursuit of democratic politics and the sentiment of overseas Chinese participation in politics; because only by making overseas Chinese closely related to the politics of the motherland can overseas Chinese automatically and actively serve the motherland, and the education community naturally bears a great responsibility for this. (3) In addition to school courses, or in conjunction with school courses, actively lead overseas Chinese compatriots to educate overseas Chinese compatriots and organize overseas Chinese compatriots. To realize this requirement, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate a large number of young cadres and lead them to do mobilization work for overseas Chinese compatriots, and at the same time, vigorously establish various tutoring schools, launch the New Writing Movement and general literacy movements, and use national salvation dramas, ×× songs, etc. to develop mass education.</p>
<p>Third, we must also know that when we are working hard to improve overseas Chinese education, we will inevitably encounter various external and internal obstacles. We must calmly recognize the source and reality of the obstacles, determine the methods and steps to deal with them, and carry out a tenacious struggle. At present, what we need to pay special attention to is, first, those who only know their personal interests and regard their personal interests as higher than the interests of the country and the nation, that is, those pessimistic and disappointed elements who advocate peace. Although they may not necessarily be traitors, they have in fact become tools of the Japanese ×; second, those who promote remarks such as "the royal way of paradise," "Greater East Asia," and "anti-communist, pro-Japanese peace," ××××××××××</p>
<p>Finally, people in our overseas Chinese education community are also often frustrated in life and have no way out in their thinking, and they are depressed, confused, pessimistic, and decadent. This is because they usually do not care about the national and international situation, and they think that they are not worth studying general political theories. Therefore, they feel at a loss about the ever-changing, complex situation. If their understanding is not clear, their will cannot be firm, their energy cannot be concentrated, and they cannot be vigorous, active, and promising. Coupled with personal suffering in life, they even take the road of national defeatism, and because of pessimism and disappointment, they embark on the black road of wavering, compromising, surrendering to seek peace, and harming the nation! Therefore, we must strengthen the unity of the educational community itself, sweep away the accumulated habits of decadence, cultivate vigorous vitality, and realize the spiritual mobilization of the overseas Chinese education community. On the one hand, we must take the lead in practice to fight against all obstacles and lead young people and overseas Chinese compatriots in general. On the other hand, we must intensify our own learning and self-cultivation in this practical work. The first is to enhance our revolutionary theory. The greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen lies in his lofty ideals and revolutionary theories. He advocated the saying that knowing is difficult and doing is easy. ×××××××××××××××× We should especially take him as our teacher and role model, ×××××, and enhance our practice and interest in improving education to serve ×× nation-building!</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Chinese Student National Salvation Association Over the Past Year <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Dai</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) It has been more than a year since the Chinese Student National Salvation Association held its second national congress in Wuhan last March. Over the past year, under the leadership of the government and with the support of progressive people from all walks of life, whether on the front lines or in the rear, at home or abroad, they have been constantly and bravely fighting to complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation. Now, taking advantage of the 20th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, we will briefly describe the important work of the Student Association to people from all walks of life and students across the country.</p>
<p>I. Routine Work</p>
<p>Routine work refers to the three daily tasks of contact, publicity, and service!</p>
<p>1. Contact Work: In order to strengthen the connection between member organizations in various places, according to the resolution of the Congress, offices were set up in important neighboring cities, and representatives were often sent to various places to inspect and investigate, assist local arrangements, and solve problems.</p>
<p>During this year, new member organizations have been added from time to time, mainly including the All-Xinjiang Student Federation, the Chinese Student National Salvation Association of Manila, the United Federation of Overseas Chinese Students' Anti-Japanese Support Association of Malaya, and the Shanghai Student National Salvation Association, etc., more than ten organizations.</p>
<p>2. Propaganda Work: Publications are regularly published in China, and various practical propaganda outlines and work principles are issued to collect propaganda materials and distribute them to member organizations in various places. Responding to the government's call and participating in various temporary drafts, the main ones are the 19th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement last year, the Taierzhuang Victory Propaganda Week, the Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction Propaganda Week, the Wuhan Defense Propaganda Week, the 3rd Anniversary of the "January 28" Student Festival, and the recently held Second Phase of Anti-Japanese War Official Propaganda Second Week, National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, etc., all properly coordinated, and concrete measures were formulated to call on students to work together.</p>
<p>Internationally, in addition to sending representatives to live in Europe and the United States for publicity, we also regularly collect stories of the heroic struggles of young students in the War of Resistance and other actual propaganda materials in China. After being organized and translated, they are regularly supplied to foreign news agencies stationed in China or sent directly to anti-aggression people's organizations and cultural institutions in various countries. In addition, we also interviewed foreign writers and journalists who came to China for investigation, such as Agnes Smedley, and Snow, and provided them with a lot of real materials.</p>
<p>3. Service Work: It can be divided into three main parts: one is to organize battlefield service groups to go to the battlefield and the rear of the × people to do battlefield service work; one is to organize service groups to go to refugee camps to serve refugees; and the other is to work with the job referral work of the organization itself.</p>
<p>II. Temporary Work</p>
<p>2. Welcoming the World Student Association Delegation to China.</p>
<p>The heroic struggle of Chinese students in the national liberation struggle has aroused the concern and respect of progressive people all over the world. On August 25, 1937, the World Student Association Congress was held. The Chinese Student Association sent a representative, Chen Quantian, to attend and participate, and proposed to the Congress that the World Student Association organize a delegation to China for investigation. Before the representatives set off to China, we immediately began to prepare to receive them, and sent representatives to various places to assist the local student associations in arranging all reception work. Before and after in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Changsha, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an Kunming and other places, under the leadership of the government, the local youth student organizations jointly established a reception committee to design and implement all reception work. After the delegation came to China, they were warmly welcomed in various parts of the country and held expanded lectures and various symposiums to discuss some issues in the world student movement and the Chinese student movement. They also collected actual work reports from students in various places, as well as various propaganda materials. Recently, they wrote that they have compiled and translated the propaganda materials they brought back and shipped them to various countries for circulation and exhibition to expand the aid to China movement. In this reception work, on the one hand, we strengthened the world's deep understanding of our victory in the War of Resistance and the success of nation-building, and at the same time, we also demonstrated the great power of unity among colleagues across the country.</p>
<p>2. Attending the World Youth Peace Conference</p>
<p>At the first congress of the World Youth Peace Conference held in Geneva in 1936, the Student Association sent Comrade Lu Cui as a representative to attend. On August 15 last year, the second congress was held in New York. Comrade Lu Cui, the representative of the Student Association, and the representatives sent from China formed the Chinese delegation to attend together. The Chinese Student Association also directly sent a letter to the Presidium of the Congress from China to congratulate them.</p>
<p>3. Celebrating the First Plenary Session of the National参政Council</p>
<p>Before the opening of the National参政Council, the Student Association sent representatives to visit the参政members separately to provide them with many opinions and materials, and wrote to the National参政Council to make detailed opinions and suggestions on issues such as uniting students across the country, mobilizing youth across the country, and wartime education and relief for unemployed and out-of-school youth. In addition, students in Chaoshan, Sichuan and other places also wrote to the参政Council separately to make personal demands. This can enable the government authorities and progressive people from all walks of life to have a clearer understanding of the demands and attitudes of young students, make the connection between students and all parties closer, and be able to obtain more sympathy and guidance from the community.</p>
<p>4. The Work of Defending Wuhan</p>
<p>The Student Association directly responded to the government's call to defend Greater Wuhan. After Xu Zhou's withdrawal, he first initiated the establishment of the "Joint Office of Wuhan Organizations" in conjunction with various mass organizations in Wuhan. Under the command of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the defense work of the three towns of Wuhan was coordinated. There were detailed plans and arrangements on how to mobilize students to organize wartime work teams, how to evacuate the population, and how to organize consolation groups, and they all achieved considerable results. On the anniversary of "August 13," it also united with various organizations in Wuhan to convene a youth participation in the war conference to mobilize youth to participate in wartime work. During the urgent period of Wuhan's gathering, it united with all walks of life to organize a consolation group to go to the front lines on both sides of Dahua to offer condolences. At the same time, when various publications moved one after another, the Student Association specially published a special issue on wartime youth defending Wuhan for propaganda. At the same time, representatives were sent to Changsha, Guangzhou, Guilin, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an and other places to mobilize students to work together to defend Wuhan and strive for victory in the War of Resistance. At that time, the conscription of consolation items in various places, the organization of battlefield work teams, and the mobilization of Zhuang Ding all had obvious achievements.</p>
<p>5. The Transfer Work of the Standing Committee</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of wartime and arrange future work, the Student Association, on the one hand, left most of its staff to work in Wuhan for a long time, and Wuhan fell and retreated to the border area of Henan and Hubei, serving as the link between the front and rear of Central China. On the one hand, representatives Zheng Dai and Li Geng were sent to inspect the provinces in Southwest China, passing through Changsha, Guilin, and Guangzhou to Guiyang and entering Chongqing. Representative Fu Xiang? was also sent to inspect the provinces in Northwest China, passing through Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Chengdu Yu. Along the way, Fang Jiandui reported on the work of the students, and actually asked for opinions on the work of the youth and students. They visited progressive people from all walks of life to ask for instructions, and visited various organizations and schools to solicit work opinions and discuss future directions, and collected work reports and actual materials. When the South China War broke out, the Student Association representative happened to be in Guangzhou and immediately assisted the local student organizations to organize wartime work teams to participate in frontline work. Standing Committee member Zhang Jianying also stayed to participate in the work of the Fourth War Zone Joint Committee for direct command. In addition, representative Fang Lianbai was sent to investigate and comfort the provinces in Southeast China. He took the road through Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces and turned to Sichuan by sea. The representatives of the various investigation teams arrived in Chongqing one after another. In November last year, they notified all parties that the Standing Committee of the Student Association officially moved to Chongqing to work.</p>
<p>6. The 3rd Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement</p>
<p>As soon as the Standing Committee moved, it actively prepared for the 3rd anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement. First, the Student Association sent representatives to participate in the joint symposium of youth organizations in Chongqing and invited various organizations to organize the "December 9th" 3rd Anniversary Commemorative Preparatory Committee. On the day of the 3rd anniversary of "December 9th," the Student Association issued a letter to students across the country, which was published in various newspapers and mailed to various places, jointly issued a commemorative declaration with various organizations, and jointly held an expanded commemorative meeting with various organizations. More than 2,000 students participated, and Mr. Chen Lifu, Zhang Shenfu, Zou Taofen, Cheng Ximeng and other gentlemen were invited to attend the meeting and give speeches. The grand occasion was unprecedented, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>7. The Youth Day Donation Movement</p>
<p>At the beginning of March, the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement initiated the Donation Movement Week and designated March 12 as Youth Donation Day. On March 7, the Sanminzhuyi Youth League invited various organizations to discuss the implementation, and the Student Association also participated as agreed and worked together. However, at that time, the schools in the city were either on winter vacation or were taking exams, and the work was difficult. However, because of the great significance, the Sanqing League took 3,500 donation receipts and immediately mobilized all the staff to go to various schools for contact work. Within three days, the receipts were taken and donations were made. All donation procedures were then handled clearly with the Three Youth League Remittance Preparatory Office.</p>
<p>8. The 20th Anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement and the Great National Spiritual Mobilization Movement are underway.</p>
<p>The "May Fourth" Movement has great epoch-making significance in the history of Chinese culture, especially in implementing the national spiritual mobilization, leading all members to strive for victory in the War of Resistance, and building a successful country today, commemorating the "May Fourth" is of special significance. In order to promote the patriotic spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement and expand the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, the Student Association responded to the call of the Sanminzhuyi Youth League to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement and participated in various tasks. It has formulated a concrete plan and is gradually implementing it.</p>
<p>III. Future Work</p>
<p>The Student Association cooperates with the current specific environment, adheres to its consistent purpose, and unites students to engage in the work of resisting the war and building the nation under the leadership of the government. Continue to work hard.</p>
<p>1. Respond to the government's call, such as the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, in-depth righteousness, eliminating illiteracy, official propaganda for military service, comforting the families of soldiers on expeditions, war pile service, offering donations and charity sales, etc.</p>
<p>2. Strengthen international propaganda and carry out national diplomatic activities. Collect materials in a planned way and provide them to the people of various countries. When necessary, send representatives to various countries for propaganda.</p>
<p>3. Develop service work for the students themselves, and often carry out various undertakings or movements that are closely related to the students themselves.</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>The Student Association is a student organization, and it hopes that the government authorities will guide and support it at any time. The Student Association is the students' own organization, and it is hoped that students in various places will often help and urge it. The Student Association is willing to fight for the completion of the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, under the leadership of the National Government, and under the command of the supreme leader.</p>
<h3 id="e3">New Fourth Army Education Camp Transformed into War of Resistance Academy, Enrollment Begins Mid-Month <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Special Shanghai Dispatch] In order to implement the training of backbone talent, the New Fourth Army previously established a large-scale education camp at its Southern Anhui headquarters, specifically recruiting out-of-school youth from guerrilla areas, providing them with special military and political knowledge. Youth from various places flocked to enroll and receive training, reaching more than a thousand people. The term was three months, and after graduation, they were sent to various guerrilla areas to organize the people, train the people, and other work. The educational methods adopted the following four types: (1) Military education, such as field orders, guerrilla tactics, field service, shooting instructions, military geography, etc.; (2) Classroom education, such as the situation of the War of Resistance, training the people, international issues, the history of the Chinese revolution, etc.; (3) Opportunity education, educational opportunities were used to conduct education on the spot, such as various commemorative days, temporary problems among students, or conscious news at home and abroad, and opportunities were used to implement extracurricular education; (4) Self-education, which is to educate students to educate students, such as discussion meetings, life inspection meetings, and symposiums; now, the first group of trained youth is about to graduate, and it has been decided to expand the second group and transform it into a War of Resistance Academy. The internal organization and establishment will follow the methods of the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" and the "Shaanxi Public School" in the Northwest. It is expected that enrollment will begin in mid-May.</p>
<p>Regarding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region</p>
<p>"Supplement to the statement on yesterday's second edition that was omitted"</p>
<p>There is also no foundation for the emergence of warlords. On the contrary, this is only a revolutionary base. However, after the "September 18th" Incident, especially after the North China Incident in 1935, due to the increasing depth of the Japanese × aggression and the increasing severity of the national crisis, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Central Government jointly issued the famous "August 1st Declaration," calling on all parties and classes of the country to form a united front for resisting Japan and saving the nation to carry out the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war. On December 15 of the same year, it voluntarily announced a partial change in the Soviet policy to advance the realization of this call. This declaration and the partial change in the Soviet policy gained the response and support of the people across the country. During the Xi'an Incident in 1936, the Chinese Communist Party adhered to the principle of peaceful resolution. After the Xi'an Incident was resolved, in order to unite the whole country to resist Japan, the Soviet government officially announced the cancellation of the confrontational situation between the two political powers and changed the Soviet workers' and peasants' dictatorship to a general anti-Japanese democratic political system (which is the current border region political system). This kind of open, upright, benevolent, and just action and attitude for the sake of the nation and the country is of course in line with the basic principles of any revolutionary law. Not only that, but after the Lugouqiao Incident, the central representatives of the Chinese Communist Party also had full discussions with Chairman Chiang on the issue of sincere unity and common efforts to overcome national difficulties. At that time, Chairman Chiang expressed his agreement and support for changing the Soviet political power into the border region government and becoming a component of the National Government, and promised to allocate Yan'an and other counties to be directly under the jurisdiction of the border region government. Soon after, the Soviet government, in accordance with the joint decision of the then representative of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Chiang, officially changed its name and system on September 6 and returned to the National Government to become a component of it. In subsequent conversations between Chairman Chiang and the representative of the CPC Central Committee, it was also repeatedly acknowledged.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Recent Developments in Chinese Film Education <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing Dispatch] Mr. Pan Chenghou, secretary of the Film Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, recently compiled a report on the work done in film education over the past few years and submitted it to the Ministry for review. The original report was quite lengthy. The following is an excerpt of the sections concerning educational facilities:</p>
<p>In recent years, China's social education initiatives have flourished, and the promotion of film education has gradually become widespread, extending from Mongolia in the north to Xinjiang in the west, and as far south as Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. This undertaking began with the establishment of the China Educational Film Association in 1932. By the autumn of 1936, the Ministry of Education had established the Film Education Committee to take charge of promoting it gradually. The Ministry also drafted a "Six-Year Plan for Film Education," stipulating that within six years, starting from 1936, it would complete the establishment of a film education outreach area in every county and city nationwide. The plan included establishing 80 areas in 1936, 180 areas in 1937, 400 areas in 1938, 450 areas in each of 1939 and 1940, and 460 areas in 1941. According to this plan, 81 film education outreach areas were established in various provinces and cities in 1936. Specifically, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces each established five areas; Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Shandong, Hebei, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces each established four areas; Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan provinces each established three areas; Ningxia, Guizhou, and Chahar provinces each established two areas; and Kangsu, Gansu, Qinghai, Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin), Qingdao, and other provinces and cities each established one area. In 1936, the Ministry of Education fully subsidized the purchase of equipment for various provinces and cities, including Kangsu, Gansu, Guizhou, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Weihai. Eighteen projectors were purchased (Yunnan four, Suiyuan three, Kangsu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai each one, Weihai self-supplied, the rest each two). Nineteen generators were purchased (Weihai one, the rest the same number as the projectors). The total subsidy amounted to 15,992 yuan (Yunnan over 3,000 yuan, Suiyuan over 2,000 yuan, Gansu, Guizhou, Chahar, Ningxia each over 1,500 yuan, Kangsu and Qinghai each over 900 yuan, Weihai over 600 yuan).</p>
<p>In addition, the Ministry of Education provided half-price subsidies for the purchase of equipment for various provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Fujian, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin), Qingdao, and other 20 provinces and cities. Sixty-two projectors and sixty-one generators were purchased (Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong each five, the rest three or four per province, one per city). The total subsidy amounted to 28,178 yuan (Jiangsu the most at 3,000 yuan, followed by Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Guangdong over 2,000 yuan, most others over 1,500 yuan, each city over 450 yuan). The total of both full and half subsidies was 44,170.94 yuan.</p>
<p>In 1936, the Ministry of Education stipulated a plan for educational film preparation, dividing the "types of films to be produced" into seven categories: (1) Dramatic films related to national consciousness, revolutionary history, and the New Life Movement; (2) Teaching materials and methods for primary and secondary schools; (3) General science and knowledge films; (4) Special national education films; (5) Hygiene films (divided into children's, adult, and public categories); (6) Films on the unique aspects of new and old industries in China and related to daily life; (7) Rural life films. The "quantity allocation" for 1936 stipulated the production of 60 films, allocated as 20 for the first category, 15 each for the third category, and 5 each for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh categories.</p>
<p>In 1937, the Ministry of Education's plan for educational film preparation decided to produce and purchase 200 films, and formulated production goals and quota allocations: (A) "Production Goals": (1) Promote national consciousness; (2) Advocate the New Life Movement; (3) Instill national defense knowledge (including physical education, military training, and scientific knowledge); (4) Promote national economic construction; (5) Impart life knowledge; (6) Assist school education. (B) "Film Classification": (1) Teaching films (for schools), totaling 100 films: (a) Early childhood education and kindergarten students, 10 films; (b) Primary schools, 10 films; (c) Secondary schools, 40 films; (d) Teaching methods, 10 films; (2) Cultural films (for general use), totaling 100 films: (a) Language and cultural education, 5 films; (b) Political and civic education, 25 films; (c) Livelihood education, 25 films; (d) Health education, 25 films; (e) Family education, 5 films; (f) Art education, 10 films; (g) Educational implementation agencies and methods, 10 films; (3) The Ministry's existing educational films will be more actively utilized to mobilize the national masses and strengthen the forces of resistance. In addition to self-production, over ten types have been purchased, totaling 140 types, which can be divided into six major categories: promoting national consciousness, 38 types (related to the war of resistance, all included in this category); increasing life knowledge, 16 types; instilling scientific knowledge, 11 types; imparting production skills, 34 types; assisting school education, 16 types; others related to geography, scenery, and music, 25 types. Recently, when the Ministry of Education formulated the 1939 film education administrative plan, it stipulated that in addition to continuing to print anti-Japanese war films, it would entrust academic institutions with relatively complete equipment to produce educational films on the geography, history, customs, and recent construction of the southwestern and northwestern provinces, and would also produce biographies of historical figures, geography, civics, and modern Chinese celebrities from this year onward.</p>
<p>To train technical personnel for the implementation of the Six-Year Plan, the Ministry of Education stipulated that a training class would be opened each year from 1936, with the number of students increasing annually, stipulating 90 students in 1936, 160 students in 1937, 400 students in 1938, 450 students in each of 1939 and 1940, and 460 students in 1941. It is estimated that over 2,000 students can be trained in six years, which is sufficient for the annual establishment of new educational areas in various provinces. It is noted that in September 1936, the Ministry of Education opened the first training class for electro-optical education personnel in Beijing (divided into film education and broadcasting education groups). A total of 92 students were sent from 25 provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Gansu, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan, Beijing, Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin), Qingdao, and Shanghai, to receive training. Most of the current electro-optical education officials in various provinces are graduates of this program. In July 1937, the Ministry of Education continued this class in Beijing, establishing a special electro-optical education group. There were 110 representatives from various provinces and cities. After the Ministry moved west, it continued the third training class in Chongqing in July 1938, with 66 students from various provinces and cities, of whom 37 belonged to the electro-optical education group. Although the number of students sent this year was less than before due to the war, the number sent from provinces such as Qinghai, Guizhou, Kangsu, Gansu, and Sichuan was particularly large. Therefore, the development of electro-optical education in these provinces will not be inferior to that of the southeastern provinces in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Chongqing Actively Reorganizing After Bombing / The Spirit of Resistance Is Even More Inspiring / Chairman Chiang Comforts People in Disaster Areas, They are Deeply Moved to Tears / [Enemy] Spreads False Propaganda, Broadcasting is Enough to Show Their Own Ugliness <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, September 9] Since [enemy] planes twice attacked Chongqing and bombed civilians on May 3rd and 4th, all party, government, and military agencies, under the instructions and guidance of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, have fully mobilized. No effort is spared in the relocation and accommodation of disaster victims, the rescue and treatment of the injured, the collection of the dead, and the restoration of traffic and the reorganization of the disaster area, all of which are being actively and effectively carried out. The reporter observes daily, deeply recognizing that the government and the people rely on each other in times of adversity, support each other in sickness, and care for each other in death and funerals, fully demonstrating the spirit of sincere unity, resistance to the enemy, and national construction. What is especially moving is that Chairman Chiang personally inspected various disaster areas on the 9th. The people in the disaster areas paid their respects and cheered all the way, some shouting to support the central government that rescues the country and the people, some shouting to love and support the leader who saves the country and the people, some shouting that the more cruel the Japanese bandits are, the stronger we will be, and some even shed tears of deep emotion. Chairman Chiang gave brief words of comfort to the victims along the way, and also earnestly exhorted the party, government, and military service teams to work hard. The reporter happened to pass by at the time. After Chairman Chiang left, the reporter asked the people in detail. They all expressed their gratitude to Chairman Chiang for his love for the people like children, and at the same time pointed their fingers angrily, saying that the [enemy]'s indiscriminate bombing can destroy our homes, but cannot destroy our spirit of resisting the enemy from top to bottom. We are determined to avenge this great revenge, etc. On the way back, the reporter met a certain important figure from the central government and told him about Chairman Chiang's inspection. The official laughed and said that the [enemy] is spreading rumors that Chairman Chiang has gone to Chengdu and that the central government will also leave Chongqing. You have personally seen Chairman Chiang among the people. The fact that the [enemy] is bombing civilians in Chongqing is enough to show that their plan of aggression has come to an end. To fabricate such rumors further shows that their fabrication skills are also exhausted. Chairman Chiang is in Chongqing, and the morale of the people is stable, as you have seen. The central government has no intention of moving, which I know very well. The [enemy]'s rumor-mongering skills are pitiful and ridiculous. They are still unwilling to understand themselves and broadcast freely, thinking that they are afraid of not deceiving enough people, but in fact, they are exposing their poverty and ugliness even more. Not only that, but the surroundings of the consulates and churches of various countries stationed in Chongqing are all civilians. This is well known to people from various countries in Chongqing, but the [enemy] is trying to fabricate excuses and shirk responsibility, saying that there are military facilities. This is known to all people from various countries, and it is not only what we despise. The reporter was delighted to have this trip, to personally admire Chairman Chiang's appearance, to deeply understand the spirit of unity from top to bottom, and to expose the [enemy]'s exhausted rumor-mongering skills, so he wrote it down.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, September 9] Guangzhou foreign reports: The Japanese suddenly imposed martial law at 6:00 a.m. this morning and lifted it at 9:00 a.m., but issued another order for martial law at 11:00 a.m. A foreigner from Shamian told reporters that last night, Shamian could hear dense rumbling artillery fire from the Huanshui Road area, and it was reported that the Chinese army was very active along the Guangdong-Macao Road north of Guangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Financial Policy of the Puppet Regime in North China is a Complete Failure / The Puppet Political Affairs Commission is at the End of its Rope / Begging for Mercy from Chinese and Foreign Financial Circles <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, August 8] Tianjin reports: The [enemy] puppet regime's disruption of our finance in North China, destruction of foreign exchange, and prohibition of the circulation of Chinese and foreign currencies have now been admitted to be a complete failure. The Puppet Political Affairs Commission recently issued an order that there will no longer be restrictions on carrying and storing "old legal tender," which refers to Chinese national currency, but it is not allowed to be used. This contradictory approach proves that the puppet group is absolutely unable to stop the people from storing legal tender. Without legal tender, the financial situation in the areas under their rule cannot be stable. The Tianjin traitor Liang Hongzhi convened a meeting of financial circles, ordering them not to raise the value of Chinese national currency. In other words, he will no longer allow the value of puppet currency to fall. At the same time, he convened a meeting of foreign banking circles, requesting them to maintain puppet currency, but the foreign banks argued that the best way is to change to Chinese national currency and allow it to circulate as usual. Since the fall of puppet currency, the value of the Japanese yen has also fallen because it is linked to puppet currency. However, the biggest reason for the depreciation of puppet currency is that the [enemy] is trying to buy Chinese national currency with puppet currency as much as possible to purchase foreign exchange.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, September 9] It is reported that since the Japanese army occupied Storm Island, the newly appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs, Koyama Kunizo, is now planning to link the Japanese territories north of the equator, such as Taiwan, the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Storm Islands, and appoint a governor-general to administer them, stationed in Taiwan, in order to promote Japan's "Southern Advance" policy. The "Asahi Shimbun" and "Mainichi Shimbun" claim that the government will soon adopt the form of designation. The Minister of Colonial Affairs is currently discussing the management of the above-mentioned areas with relevant departments. It is heard that the main purpose of Koyama's new policy is to implement consistent administrative management in Taiwan, the South Sea Islands, and the Storm Islands. Some Japanese believe that uniting the Southern Islands into an administrative unit and the position of the Governor-General should be elevated and given greater powers. What is most noticeable to outsiders is the opinion of the "Mainichi Shimbun," which states that Japan will appoint a new Governor-General to administer the Japanese in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, French Annam, and Singapore. The newspaper's prediction shows Japan's "increased activities" in these areas.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Visiting Zhou Enlai on the 20th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Qianxiu</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Speaking of the "May Fourth Movement," it is easiest to think of Mr. Zhou Enlai. This is certainly because he was the leader of the "May Fourth" that year, but especially because of his spirit of fighting for the nation and the country, twenty years as one day since "May Fourth." He symbolizes the "Awakening" society he organized during the "May Fourth," and has a thorough awareness of life. From that time on, he carried the cross of liberating the nation, endured all the hardships, broke through thousands of dangerous environments, and finally continued to contribute his passion and great ambitions to the nation and the country in the war of resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>It was the eve of the 20th anniversary of "May Fourth" when I suddenly heard that Mr. Zhou Enlai was passing through Guilin, so I made a special trip to commemorate "May Fourth" and visited him to ask him to write an article.</p>
<p>In an unadorned room, I met Mr. Zhou Enlai, dressed in a military uniform with a sword. He has a slender and moderate figure, a scholar's face, and a firm and wise air that overflows between his eyebrows. He looks about forty years old, but he looks very young. If you look closer, his fighting history is engraved on the corners of his eyes—there are very deep wrinkles. We shook hands and sat down, and then more guests came, so the reporter explained the purpose of his visit. "May Fourth is here again!" Mr. Zhou said with a slightly sigh, "But I really don't have time to write an article." Then he denied the request. "Hmm! The May Fourth Movement is already a full twenty years! It should be commemorated." Mr. Zhou recalled slightly, and said extremely slowly, as if he intended to make time to write. However, Mr. Zhou has many official duties, and the visitors are increasing and cannot stay in Guilin for long. It is obvious that there is no certainty of getting an article, so let's ask Mr. Zhou to talk about the "May Fourth" movement.</p>
<p>After the question was raised, Mr. Zhou talked about it a little, but he didn't have enough time to talk. This is a pity.</p>
<p>"The May Fourth Movement includes the national movement, the science and democracy movement, and the new literature movement." Mr. Zhou started from here with his evaluation and instructions on the "May Fourth Movement." "So it can be said that the May Fourth Movement was a thought revolution at that time, and it was also an enlightenment movement. From the occurrence and development of the movement, from Beijing in the north to Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangdong in the south, ... and from the cities to the villages, the impact was very great. Even the entire content of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People was gradually completed after May Fourth. However, the May Fourth Movement focused on destruction. Although it built in destruction, its destructiveness was more than its constructiveness, which was necessary at the time. For example, opposing Confucianism, 'overthrowing the Confucian shop with one hand,' did not critically accept China's cultural heritage, but denied everything. At that time, a new movement was launched, and it was inevitable to overcorrect, and it was bound to overcorrect. However, this cannot detract from its historical significance and value. However, China has made a lot of progress in the past 20 years. As far as the national movement is concerned, the opposition to Japanese imperialism at that time was only about not signing a humiliating treaty and preserving Qingdao and other places. Now it is a full-scale war of resistance. At that time, the democratic movement was only about young students rising up to fight against traitors and interfering in internal and foreign affairs. At most, it only affected progressive elements from all walks of life, who rose up to support it. Now the whole country is united and working together to shoulder the work of resisting the enemy and building the country, and is working hard to realize democracy. As for the new literature movement, at that time, it opposed classical Chinese in form and advocated vernacular Chinese, and opposed feudal consciousness and demanded freedom of thought in content. Now, not only has the new literature made a lot of gains and a solid foundation, but also the form of books, whether it is poetry, prose, or drama, is also being incorporated with new content and is being used commonly. In addition, the scientific spirit is being valued and used today, which is very natural. In short, everything is in continuous development. When we commemorate "May Fourth," we should inherit its positive and excellent traditions, promote the national liberation movement, the science and democracy movement, and promote its glorious history to benefit the war of resistance and national construction." Mr. Zhou gave a breath of speech. The visitors surrounding him did not seem to allow him to continue talking from their anxious expressions, but the reporter finally asked Mr. Zhou to criticize the youth community since the war of resistance. Mr. Zhou thought for a while and said, "Whether in the front or in the rear, the contribution of the youth is very great. This fact cannot be denied. However, some youths in some places often focus on two-character phrases, such as the Republic of China and the liberation of the Chinese nation, or a certain period and a certain stage, which originally have the same meaning. They often adhere to formalism, so disputes arise in meetings and symposiums, and even cause ideological problems, wasting time and delaying things, which is really not worth it." Speaking of this, I thought about it and said, "Young friends, there is one more thing, that is, they like to do things happily, regardless of its impact and consequences. As a result, they are unhappy. Sometimes they often cause a lot of trouble because of personal subjective happiness, which delays a lot of things. This must also be changed." The time and the situation in the room made it impossible for the reporter to ask further, so he had to say goodbye. We shook hands tightly again.</p>
<p>On the way back, I was pondering Mr. Zhou's remarks and instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Mountain City Ablaze <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Gui Ru</p>
<p>— “May Third” and “May Fourth” in Chongqing —</p>
<p>[Chongqing Correspondence from the Minkuo Daily News Agency] The bloody "May Third" is a day that the Chinese nation will not easily forget. However, on this eleventh anniversary of the "May Third" incident, the Japanese deliberately added new scars to our old wounds. When people heard the air raid alarm, every face reflected anger, and every heart was filled with new and old hatreds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sky was unusually clear, and the vast expanse was cloudless. The Japanese planes seized this rare opportunity. A large number (36 planes) came to attack this mountain city—Chongqing. At about 1:20 PM, they invaded the city's airspace, blindly dropping hundreds of heavy bombs and incendiary bombs along the lower city's commercial and civilian areas. After setting fires, they quickly fled to the horizon. The mountain city was filled with thick smoke. Countless fires shot straight into the sky. This reporter rushed to the areas that suffered the most damage—Xinfeng Street, Duanpai Fang, Qu Si Street, Zuoying Street, Nanjimen, Dayangzi, and Shenxiankou. So many ancestral halls were turned to ashes, so many roads became fields of broken tiles, and thousands of compatriots lost their precious lives in an instant. The fire in my heart also ignited unexpectedly. I cursed the Japanese: The new and old blood debts of "May Third" will be repaid to you one day!</p>
<p>Today, "May Fourth," is the anniversary of the Chinese national renaissance. The Japanese did not easily let it go because of yesterday's brutality, but came even more cruelly. The air raids on Chongqing usually took place before noon, but today, the cunning Japanese took advantage of the full moon of the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar and dared to launch an attack on the city at 6:00 PM. The number of bombs they dropped exceeded twice that of yesterday. The incendiary bombs exerted their intense heat even more fiercely, igniting upon impact and instantly turning the city's bustling commercial areas and dense residential areas into towering flames and explosions like firecrackers. The fires burned for several nights without ceasing, and traffic was completely cut off. After the air raid alarm was lifted, this reporter hurriedly walked through the unaffected streets, seeing piles of meager furniture and scattered suitcases and bundles that the affected compatriots had rescued from the fire. Countless men, women, old, and young, bearing physical and mental wounds, were lying on top of them. I had no words of consolation. In fact, reality does not allow me to offer mere verbal consolation, because before my eyes, many places desperately needed a strong and energetic young man to lend a hand. I continued forward, heading towards the places where the flames soared. Passing through Zujie Street, Zheng You Street, Chaijia Alley, and Lianhua Pond, I saw the fire shining brightly, illuminating the area like daylight. People thronged together, some helping the injured, some carrying water, and some maintaining order. Generally speaking, the situation was barely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Running to Qixinggang, the mountainside burned like a red furnace, stretching for about half a li in all directions, with no fewer than hundreds of civilian residences among them. Tonight, the homeless people are staring blankly at the leaping fireballs, planning their whereabouts for tonight or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Before "May Third" and "May Fourth," Japanese planes had visited this mountain city, but people were, after all, creatures of habit. Because they had not seen any major fires, they even ignored the evacuation orders issued by the authorities for months. Now, many people deeply regret it. Their carelessness and stubbornness are indeed reprehensible, but their courage is truly moving. As this reporter saw, the people who suffered personal losses and ruined families all concentrated their resentment on the violent Japanese. He (or she), regardless of gender or age, in the midst of surviving a catastrophe, still enthusiastically defended the government's determination to resist until the end. "You bastard, ××××××!"—This is the common curse against the violent Japanese that this reporter could hear anytime, anywhere from the people of the mountains. (May 4th)</p>
<p>[Chongqing Express News from the Minkuo Daily News Agency, Morning of May 5th] At 5:00 PM on the 4th, 46 Japanese planes bombed Chongqing. After the first alarm was issued, our planes were seen hovering in the sky for defense. After four minutes, an emergency alarm suddenly sounded. More than 20 Japanese planes arrived first. After fierce aerial combat, they stealthily entered the city's airspace and frantically dropped 900 bombs, many of which were incendiary bombs, in the commercial center and cultural center areas such as Xinglong Street, Dou You Street, Cangping Street, Zijia Alley, Qixinggang, Guangu Street, Consular Alley, and Huixian Bridge. At one point, fires broke out in all streets, spreading and burning late into the night. Commerce and culture were reduced to ashes. Countless citizens were killed or injured, and the numbers were impossible to calculate. The Japanese planes fled immediately after dropping their bombs. At 3:00 AM on the 5th, another air raid alarm was issued. Civilians were awakened from their sleep and hurriedly fled with the old and young. However, no emergency alarm was issued. At 4:00 AM, the alarm was lifted, and citizens returned to their homes to sleep. The remnants of yesterday's burning fires have not yet been completely extinguished. Rescue, defense, and firefighting personnel throughout the city, as well as members of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, are actively rescuing the affected citizens. The city is quite desolate today. Citizens without fixed occupations are moving to nearby villages. The inhumanity of the Japanese planes bombing the city for two consecutive days has been fully exposed.</p>

<p>[United Press London, 9th] House of Commons member and "News Chronicle" diplomatic correspondent Barrett declared today, according to credible sources, that the Pope has launched a proposal to convene a conference attended by Germany, Poland, Britain, France, and Italy. It is heard that the Chinese government has agreed to support it. The proposal was submitted to the British Foreign Office at the end of last week by the papal representative in London.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 9th] It has now been confirmed here that the Pope has invited Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to the Vatican for a meeting to discuss a resolution to the German-Polish dispute. It is also understood that the Italian Mediterranean disputes may be discussed at the same time. The countries are currently considering and discussing it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 9th] It is reported that Britain and France have decided that if Poland agrees to the Pope's mediation invitation, Britain and France are also willing to accept it in principle, as Britain and France have already stated that they will allow Poland to freely handle the issues of Danzig and the Corridor. It is also understood that Hitler inquired about the Pope's true intentions and detailed plans for mediating the dispute from a Vatican representative in Berchtesgaden at the end of the week, but Hitler did not indicate whether he would accept it or not.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London, 9th] The "Yorkshire Evening Post" diplomatic correspondent declared that the reactions of various countries to the Pope's launching of a conference of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland do not seem to be completely satisfactory. Britain is enthusiastically supporting it, while Germany and Italy are unwilling to participate because they occupy a minority position of power. France is unwilling to discuss Tunisia, and Poland is unwilling to discuss the Danzig issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 8th] Undersecretary Butler, in answering a question regarding the future status and administrative affairs of Danzig, said, "The British government advocates resolving international disputes through friendly negotiations, public arbitration, or other peaceful means, and is willing to participate at any time at the request of the parties concerned." Prime Minister Chamberlain also stayed in the House of Commons and said that the government greatly welcomed Burke's "clear and mixed" wording in his May 5th speech and is now carefully studying its content. As for the situation caused by the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, it is currently being carefully considered, and a note will be submitted to Germany soon. The German government did not notify the British government when it announced the abolition of the agreement.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London, 8th] The "Times" Berlin correspondent said that Mussolini's request for Poland to mediate the Danzig issue has been rejected by Poland. The newspaper's Rome correspondent said that Mussolini did indeed propose to Poland to mediate the German-Polish dispute. Despite these reports, it is still generally hoped that a peaceful resolution can be obtained. Anti-Polish propaganda has begun in Berlin. The "Daily Mail" Berlin correspondent said that the Nazis in Danzig will soon request Hitler to annex Danzig into Germany. Some even believe that the Nazis in Danzig may automatically declare annexation to Germany. If such a thing happens, Poland will inevitably send troops to Danzig to protect its rights. At that point, Hitler will certainly rise up and denounce Poland as an aggressor.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Rome, 9th] According to diplomatic sources, the first action after the establishment of the German-Italian military alliance is to deal with Poland in order to achieve an effective solution to the issues of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. It is believed that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will submit new demands to Poland, asking Poland to reconsider its attitude on this issue. At the same time, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will also briefly persuade Poland to resolve the issue satisfactorily as soon as possible. The new German demands are approximately as follows: (1) Return Danzig; (2) Allow the construction of roads and highways in the Corridor; (3) Conclude a 25-year non-aggression pact; (4) Acknowledge</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 8th] The German government is extremely pleased with the conclusion of the German-Italian military alliance and is now actively planning and employing strategies to break through Poland's resistance. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler has decided to apply a delaying tactic to wait for Poland's mobilization to be excessively costly and financially exhausted, so that it will be subdued without a fight. Secondly, Germany's policy is to promote "cumulative emotions" in various German-Polish issues. It is believed that Germany's current demand is for Poland to withdraw from the British and French guarantees and join the Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Rome, 8th] The "Messenger" recently reported that the German-Italian political and military alliance will be signed in early June.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Rome, 8th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued a statement in the Milanese newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia," the mouthpiece of Mussolini, warning democratic countries that Mussolini and Hitler and their peoples are invincible and that both Germany and Italy desire peace. Discussing the German-Italian military alliance, he said, "I believe that Germany and Italy have given the democratic countries that are constantly afraid of aggression the best answer."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 8th] The diplomatic correspondent of the Hamburg "Guide Record" published a commentary, apparently under official instructions, warning Britain and Poland that if necessary, Germany and Italy are prepared to resolve the German-Polish dispute in accordance with the provisions of the military alliance.</p>
<h3 id="e22">British Ambassador Delivers Counter-Proposals; Soviet Union Said to Have Accepted; to Help Central and Southern Europe Resist Aggression; Four Nordic Foreign Ministers Meet in Sweden <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Moscow, 9th] Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov met with British Ambassador Seeds yesterday and accepted the British counter-proposals. Political circles say that the content of the British proposal is as follows: (1) The Soviet Union makes guarantees to its five directly adjacent countries, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Romania; (2) If a war occurs because the Soviet Union implements the guarantees, Britain agrees to provide assistance. The British and Soviet governments are currently maintaining silence, so this news has not yet been officially confirmed.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 8th] Reuters' diplomatic correspondent said that the fact that the British ambassador to the Soviet Union presented the British proposals to Molotov in person proves that the British government has obtained satisfactory assurances, namely that Litvinov's resignation will not affect the Soviet Union's foreign policy. At the same time, it also indicates that the Soviet Union also hopes that the British counter-proposal can become the basis for mutual understanding. While the British proposal also accepts the Soviet proposal to actually establish an alliance relationship, it believes that it will be able to assist the countries bordering Central Europe, Southern Europe, and the Soviet Union on a basis of mutual coordination in order to resist aggression. Discussions and exchanges of information will be conducted regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Debate in the House of Commons on Anglo-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 8th] In the House of Commons, Member of Parliament Henderson asked whether the government's policy is to strive for full cooperation with the Soviet Union to establish a system of resistance to any aggression based on mutual guarantees. The Prime Minister replied that the government's goal is to obtain the full cooperation of the Soviet Union for Britain's current policies. Then, Labour MP Fletcher asked whether the change of Foreign Minister in the Soviet Union would not affect the Soviet proposals. The Prime Minister replied that he could not provide a definite answer. The Prime Minister also replied to opposition leader Attlee that there has been no relaxation in obtaining collective security methods.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 8th] Conservative MP Boothby asked in the House of Commons today whether Prime Minister Chamberlain also knows that the majority of the British people advocate concluding a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union. Britain has already guaranteed the safety of Poland and Romania, but the government has not yet taken any measures to supplement the guarantees, causing great anxiety among all sectors of the country. In view of this, the Prime Minister is willing to provide a guarantee explaining that he is determined to conclude a British, French, and Soviet pact as soon as possible. Chamberlain replied, "I do not know how the British public has this. I do not know on what basis Mr. Boothby's remarks are based."</p>
<p>[Reuters Stockholm, 9th] The foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark held a meeting here this morning to discuss Germany's non-aggression proposal.

<h3 id="e27">British Conscription Bill Passes Second Reading in the House; Lloyd George Delivers Speech; Agrees to Unite with the Soviet Union Against Japan <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 8th] The Labour Party's amendment to the conscription bill was rejected in the House of Commons today by a vote of 145 to 387. Thus, the second reading of the bill was passed without objection.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 8th] When the conscription bill was presented for second reading debate in the House of Commons today, Labour MP Payne asked whether the government's failure to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union would affect national security and whether the value of the conscription bill was not equivalent to reaching an understanding with the Soviet Union. Morrison, representing the Minister of Defense, replied that the formation of this new army would be able to fulfill its duties and maintain its past glory when Britain freely encountered danger. The proposal of this bill has swept away the doubts of others about the guarantees we have recently made. The people of the country, even the young people who are most affected, unanimously support this bill. It is even more unfounded to say that the trade union will be the first to be affected by this bill. Lloyd George rose to speak, saying that in terms of responsibility, he should support the government's proposal, but he believed that the number of people called up was not enough. Lloyd George also agreed to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, saying that the dispatch of troops by Germany and Italy could be doubled by the total of Britain, France, and Poland, and if the Soviet Union were to help, it would not be easy to implement the guarantees to Poland, Romania, and Greece. In the Far East, Japan is now eager to move and intends to monopolize it. During the European War, India sent one million troops to back Britain, and Vietnam sent 500,000 troops to support France. If we do not cooperate with the Soviet Union and have Japan as an enemy, how will we make up for this deficiency?</p>
<p>One Scene of the Debate</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 8th] During the debate on the military training bill in the House of Commons today, Labour MP Gordon MacDonald opposed the bill, his reason being that the bill was not approved by the whole country and was unnecessary. Conservative MP Kerr said that Lloyd George has raised a question that cannot be answered on the military training bill. Regardless of the Soviet Union, he believed that we would be able to fulfill our duties. He also suggested that the government take steps so that all people in the country would be obliged to serve in the event of war, and the national record system could be abolished. Cripps also opposed the bill, saying that if Prime Minister Chamberlain could immediately conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union, he would be able to show the world a more powerful British attitude. Independent Labour Party MP McGovern said that the party would do its best to encourage young people to refuse to fight and oppose conscription. Conservative Ross opposed the separate treatment of Northern Ireland and other parts of the Empire. Opposition leader Attlee said that the government had not shown that the conscription bill was militarily necessary, nor could it clearly state that the number of people required could not be supplied by the voluntary service system. Secretary of War Hore-Belisha replied on behalf of the government that the government had received many telegrams from foreign countries, and these telegrams repeatedly stated that the conscription system could give them hope and assurance in pursuing public ideals.</p>

<p>[Reuters Verdun, 8th] Former British King, the Duke of Windsor, said in a broadcast to the United States today, "I have been silent for a long time, and the reason why I make an exception to say something is only because the situation is critical, and we may be plunged into the catastrophe of twenty-five years ago." He emphasized that he was speaking purely as a soldier of the last war. His most sincere prayer is that the madness of the previous cruel destruction will not happen again to human beings. Peace is very important and cannot be regarded as a political issue. Modern warfare is that victory is in the hands of evil forces, and the result will inevitably lead to anarchy and chaos, and both will feel sad. This is true in Britain and France, and it is also true in Germany. We can still work together for international understanding today, but the tense political situation is often an obstacle to mutual understanding. In private contacts, we strive to live in harmony with others, otherwise civilization cannot be produced. This is the case in private matters, and the same is true in international affairs. Do we want to let civilization be destroyed? I do not want to use words such as "encirclement" and "aggression." These words arouse our dangerous emotions. The actions of politicians who seek to restore international security and trust must be in the style of good citizens of the world, and not just good citizens of France, Italy, Germany, the United States, or Britain. The greatest success of a government in implementing its national policy is insignificant compared to the success of helping to save humanity from catastrophe. As for concrete suggestions, it is not my responsibility, but it is up to the officials who are in power, who have the right to lead the country towards mutual understanding. May God bless them to complete this difficult work as soon as possible, and not too late.</p>

<p>— Liao Chongsheng</p>
<p>In terms of raw materials, the country's most keenly felt shortages are iron and kerosene. As for kerosene, its peacetime consumption is approximately five million tons per year. Domestic supply, at best, is no more than two million tons, but wartime consumption, due to the full utilization of machinery, is estimated by experts to be at least three or four times that of peacetime, which is to say, annual consumption would be between fifteen and twenty million tons. This means that its domestic supply only covers about ten or fifteen percent of wartime consumption. As for the Romanian oil fields, if the country could monopolize them, it could certainly alleviate its predicament greatly. Indeed, Romania's highest recorded annual kerosene production reached 8.7 million tons (in 1936), which is approximately enough to supply half of its wartime consumption. However, if Soviet Russia can follow Britain in guaranteeing Romania's independence, whether Germany can completely control Romania as it wishes is a major question. Moreover, even if Romania supplies [them], will its supply be sufficient?</p>
<p>Regarding the supply of iron, because the Alsace-Lorraine provinces are heavily guarded by France, Germany is now even more deficient than in the time of Wilhelm II. Recently, the country's annual iron imports still amount to 20 million tons, mostly from France and Sweden. In recent years, in addition to actively developing its domestic reserves, it has placed great hope in Yugoslavia, because the country's reserves are abundant. However, the development and utilization of iron ore is a slow and complex process, requiring a long time, and not as easy as promoting international trade. According to recent statistics, the country's annual iron production is still less than one million tons. Therefore, once the source from Western Europe is cut off, unless after a considerable period of waiting, seeking a complete solution to its iron needs from the South is like trying to catch fish in a tree!</p>
<p>A Brief Comment</p>
<h3 id="e33">Britain's Pro-Soviet Anti-Japanese Movement <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday evening's news, "The Soviet Union has not changed its diplomatic policy of guaranteeing Britain," and "Britain's counter-proposal to the Soviet Union can establish a basis for understanding," thus proving that "the door to Anglo-Soviet cooperation has not closed."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's diplomatic policy has not changed due to the resignation of Litvinov. This is something we pointed out clearly long ago, and it need not wait for the Soviet Union to issue a guarantee; it is already universally understood. Certain people who fear not causing chaos, a few reporters willing to be exploited by Japanese [spies] and traitors, have been spreading rumors and criticizing the Soviet Union based on the resignation of Litvinov, even claiming that Soviet-German diplomatic relations will have new developments. The absurd theories of these people are certainly not worth refuting, but their spreading rumors or misleading the public to shake the trust of righteous people in the Soviet Union is something we should not ignore.</p>
<p>Now that the German-Italian military alliance has been formally established, and the collusion between Japan and Germany seems to have further developments, we should not overestimate the strength of this outwardly fierce but inwardly weak collusion, but it can also serve as a ruthless spur to Britain's past incomplete policy of uniting with the Soviet Union against aggression. Hitler and Mussolini are also trying to use the strength of this collusion to [unclear text], which is not only seen by those familiar with international current affairs but is also a cause for concern among the majority of the British public and those with misperceptions in its government. Therefore, from today's international news reports, we can see that Britain is united in promoting the pro-Soviet anti-Japanese movement. Labor MP Mr. Paine and Liberal leader Lloyd George strongly support this movement. Lloyd George also explicitly advocated that Britain and the Soviet Union establish an agreement. He said, "Germany and Italy can mobilize twice the total number of troops that Britain, France, and Poland can mobilize. Without the cooperation of the Soviet Union, Britain's guarantee to Poland, the Baltic states, and Greece will be impossible to fulfill." He also said that Japan is now attempting [something] in the Far East. During the last World War, Britain obtained one million troops from India, and France also mobilized 500,000 people from Annam. If there is no assistance from the Soviet Union, and with Japan as an enemy in the East, how can we truly fill these gaps?"</p>
<p>We firmly believe that only by Britain uniting with the Soviet Union against Japan and Germany and Italy can Britain be saved from the encirclement of fascist aggressors. Only by Britain leading the union with the Soviet Union against Japan and Germany and Italy can the entire world be saved from the poisonous flames of fascist aggressors. However, the British government has not yet actively adopted this policy, and the conspiratorial activities of fascist aggressors are even more rampant. Nowhere in the world will there be a piece of quiet land. Therefore, we must currently have a strong sense of hatred for those reckless people and commentators who stand in the way and shoot cold arrows at peacemakers, those elements willing to be exploited by Japanese, [Austrian?] and traitorous spies. We must also promote public opinion, mobilize righteous people around the world, and promote Anglo-Soviet cooperation and the anti-aggression front.</p>

<h3 id="e37">The Women's War Relief Association Actively Carries Out Benefit Performances by Ladies and Celebrities; Four Nights of Performances at Taiping Theatre Starting June 1; Lead Roles in "Diao Chan" and "Dream of the Red Chamber" Have Been Decided <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The national crisis is severe. The women's relief work has made rapid progress and is admired by people at home and abroad. The Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association is currently organizing a benefit performance by ladies and celebrities to raise funds for the country. The work is particularly active. The country has received enthusiastic participation from ladies and celebrities, and art experts are responsible for training. They have worked hard for four months. It is now scheduled to perform famous plays for four consecutive nights, starting on June 1st, at Taiping Theatre. One is "Diao Chan" and the other is "Dream of the Red Chamber."</p>
<p>Diao Chan</p>
<p>The play "Diao Chan" is a love affair that has been passed down in history. The selection of the lead roles in the play is extremely confidential. It is specially said that Mr. Ruan Weiyang, the son of a business celebrity, is versed in medical theory and uses his emotions realistically. Sometimes he glares angrily, sometimes he lowers his eyebrows to write, for his son Lu Bu and his beloved concubine Diao Chan. The roles of Lu Bu and Diao Chan are played by Mr. and Mrs. Sun, the younger brother and sister-in-law of Mrs. Yi Shijie, the chairman of the association. Mrs. Liu Pang Lian'ai plays the scene of Diao Chan worshiping the moon, revealing her full heart, including her great ambition to support the Han and eliminate the traitors, which is even more moving. It can also meet the purpose of the women's circle enthusiastically saving the country today, and can awaken the masses of girls on the same front to work together. Then, Mr. and Mrs. Liu co-starred in the scene of Lu Bu peeking at Diao Chan's dressing, which is the most exciting, because they are deeply in love and can take the opportunity to appear on stage to show their love in person. Looking at her scene of complaining in Fengyi Pavilion, her emotions are like grievances, like pleasures, like weeping, like suing, at this time the audience will be afraid to shed tears. The role of Wang Yun is played by Mr. Zhong Qiyuan. He arranges a wonderful plan, using the marriage of a weak woman to secretly betray, and finally makes Dong Zhuo be killed by Lu Bu, to eliminate traitors for the country. The role of Emperor Xian of Han is played by Mr. Li Juyang, manager of the European and American Electroplate Company. When he is held hostage by Dong, he expresses a kind of terrifying and desolate scene. In short, it is even more sad and indignant.</p>
<p>Dream of the Red Chamber</p>
<p>As for the play "Dream of the Red Chamber", it is originally a history of delicate emotions. The plot is tight. Please Mr. Luo Tangsheng to play Jia Baoyu. Mr. Luo has a deep research on music and is gentle and elegant. He is truly a handsome young man in a troubled world.

<h3 id="e40">Watching a Shame-Seeking Film on National Shame Day <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Ximing</p>
<p>"War of Resistance Special" Is Unprecedentedly Grand; The Audience's Enthusiasm Is Unmatched by Other Films</p>
<p>A Special Report</p>
<p>The China Film Studio dispatched a large number of photographers to go deep into various battlefields. The purpose of taking the "War of Resistance Special" is entirely to introduce China, which is progressing in the War of Resistance, to compatriots at home and abroad, as well as to international friends who care about China. The government's establishment of the film studio and the direct supervision of the studio's products by the Political Department of the Military Commission certainly has great significance.</p>
<p>The "War of Resistance Special Collection No. 6" is currently being screened at the Central Theatre. In order to allow Hong Kong compatriots to universally watch the film, many measures have been specially formulated, such as (1) reducing seat prices, (2) increasing the number of screenings, with six consecutive screenings from 12:30 PM to 9:50 PM every day, (3) special preferential treatment for the academic community to visit, (4) the use of half-price tickets, etc. This method of "seeking universality" is also the reason why the government is willing to fund the production of films. It can record the entire history of the War of Resistance and exert its broad propaganda power.</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the results of the first day of the film's screening were six full houses, and although the seat prices were reduced, the income still reached more than 1,700 yuan. It can be seen that the audience is crowded, and it can be seen that Hong Kong compatriots are concerned about the motherland's war of resistance. Although viewers only spent very little money to watch this war of resistance film, this small amount of money accumulated can then be used to make many war of resistance films, so that we can constantly obtain "spiritual food."</p>
<p>The first day of the screening of "War of Resistance Special Collection No. 6" happened to be May 7th, and yesterday was May 9th. On this national shame day, watching this film of the War of Resistance is especially memorable. On this day, the Central Theatre specially obtained the consent of the China Film Studio to donate all the income from the daytime screenings to the government, so the audience was even more enthusiastic, and the results were better than expected. The funds have been handed over to the Bank of China today for remittance.</p>
<p>The general opinion of Hong Kong filmmakers and theatres is that "national defense films don't make money." In other words, the audience does not welcome them. However, the results of the screening of "Eight Hundred Heroes," "The Spirit of Loyalty," and "War of Resistance Special Collection" Numbers 1 to 5, all produced by the China Film Studio, in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia were very good. This can prove that "national defense films are welcomed by the audience, but they must be careful, solemn, and content-rich national defense films."</p>
<p>It is especially worth mentioning the emotions of the audience. When the audience saw countless scenes in the "War of Resistance Special," such as "Our Army Wins Great Victories," "Army and Civilians Cooperate," "Lone Army Raises the Flag," "[blank] People Are Captured," etc., the kind of irrepressible enthusiasm made the entire theatre applaud non-stop, and they were extremely excited. This situation is not found in "non-national defense films" and cannot be created by theatrical skills.</p>

<h3 id="e41">A Salute to Cartoonists! A Victory and Success Symbolizing Art Exhibition <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>This is a letter from a cartoonist to a lost companion:</p>
<p>"Comrade ××:</p>
<p>It is with great sorrow that we read your cartoon work published in the traitor's newspaper. How much we regret the loss of a warrior who once fought for cartoons!</p>
<p>Comrade, it is simply unbelievable that you would leave our ranks, because you have a glorious history. In Shanghai, you worked with us against aggression. Comrade, how hard you worked then, but now, how saddened we are by your defection! You are still young, a time when you should be fighting for the survival of your country, but you have given up. You have given up your life, you have given up your relatives and friends, you seem to have forgotten the meaning of justice and conscience. Comrade, perhaps these things are not your own intention? I understand, because you are too lonely, and a dark atmosphere is surrounding you, preventing you from finding the light.</p>
<p>Comrade, you should tell us, put down your myopia, and frankly express your aspirations in life. You should think, you are a Chinese, a fighter with artistry. We are waiting for you to return to our ranks, as long as you can sober up.</p>
<p>Come back, dear comrade. We really don't want to lose you, but why are you willing to lose us? Tell us! Are you being deceived because of your livelihood? Or are you voluntarily abandoning your past history? We really want to understand.</p>
<p>Now, we are all quietly waiting for your reply, please do not underestimate the good intentions of the public! Finally, I wish you awakening.</p>
<p>Cartoon workers Ye Qianyu, Zhang Guangyu, Huang Ding, Huang Miaozi, Chen Yiqiao, Li Fanfu Zheng Jiazhen, Xiao Ding, Jian Xianqi, Lin Qin,</p>
<p>February 8, 5, 2,"</p>
<p>From the lines of this letter, we fully understand how our calligraphers are progressing and how loyal they are! The sincere style of persuading lost companions to turn back is also a model for us to emulate! Salute! Our calligraphers!</p>
<p>This time, the Hong Kong branch of the National Association of Cartoonists gathered more than fifty masterpieces of cartoonists from all over the country and held a calligraphy exhibition at the Central Theatre. We had already believed in the consciousness aspect before, and after actually visiting, we were amazed. Mr. Ndgor Now, the author of "Westward Cartoon Journey" Snow, said after visiting the pre-show on April 30: "...It depicts China's multifaceted struggle, and it proves that China's 'art front' is a strong backing for China's military front, and it is worthy of support." This is indeed the resonance of many people, without any exaggeration or strong irony.</p>
<p>In the struggle against the war, everything is growing and everything is progressing. Art works are not only no exception, but also serve as serious and lively members, and are very effective tools of emotional expression.</p>
<p>The reporter squeezed into the crowd of visitors and deeply sighed that each piece has its own unique features. "××××××××××××××××× depicts the ordinary people's ××× government." A good older sister pointed to a piece of "×××××××××" and explained it to her younger brother. The younger brother shouted innocently and jumped up, which is really an education that should be accepted.</p>
<p>"Men should be soldiers, women should cultivate, ×× production protects China." The background is after the bombing, and the characters are a brother and sister who stand up and move forward. "We only have one way—struggle" not only vividly reflects reality, but also writes the beauty of new women in art, returning to nature against artificiality. How beautiful and lovely!</p>
<p>"×××××××××××××××××!" The bait of peace "makes people feel miserable that even democratic countries have fallen for the trick of × people. Will this trick not be exposed to people all over the world one day?"</p>
<p>"Another Kind of People" has a very profound meaning. You have to think about it to understand. I wonder what this "kind of person" who drinks the blood of others leisurely and happily thinks after seeing it? "Equal to Murder" is also a piece that needs to be thought about.</p>
<p>"Sweat of the People" makes people shed a tear of pain, "××××" is actually like this, endure—endure, just like "glorious injury" Our tomorrow is not yesterday.</p>
<p>"Soldiers love the people, the people help the soldiers, ×××××××" is also a vivid depiction of reality, a miracle forged from the history of great China. It really makes people feel infinitely happy and inspired!</p>
<p>The contrast between the two calligraphy images of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei is particularly powerful. The former is a kind and heroic figure, the background is the national flag, the soldiers going to the front line, and the national flags of Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union, with the inscription "The Revelation of Victory", which is really the best. What about Wang Jingwei? ××××××××××××××××××, take a closer look at what words the author wrote? Tsk! It turned out to be "Just an example!"</p>
<p>There are still many works that I can't really say enough about. Art works that oppose isolating reality, such as "flowers, birds, insects, fish, landscapes, and ladies" are successful art works, and are a concrete reflection of the consciousness in the letter above. Its future is as bright as the war of resistance. These works have jumped from printing presses and painting books to large white cloths and village walls, from leisurely appreciation to the forefront of the national struggle. She has stepped through the front lines, the rear, the countryside, and the city. We will "wash and lift" her and send her on a "long journey." The reporter's rough and superficial report here only describes a small part of this exhibition. Today is the last day of the exhibition, let the visitors appreciate it themselves!</p>

<h3 id="e42">Guangdong Relief Association Actively Relieves Refugees Throughout the Province Intensifies Relief Efforts in Two Aspects, Active and Passive Relief Expenses Total More Than 17 Million Yuan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Correspondence) The Guangdong Branch of the Refugee Relief Committee of Guangdong Province of the Extraordinary Period, since it was reorganized into the Guangdong Relief Association on February 1 this year in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, reorganized the refugee relief associations in all counties and cities in the province, and adjusted the internal structure, with Chairman Li Hanhun concurrently serving as the Director of the Committee, and hired enthusiastic philanthropists and well-known people from all walks of life to serve as members, or nominal members and consultants, etc., and elected He Tong, Lu Huiniu, Chen Rutang, Wu Jufang, and Mai Chaoshu, five people as standing committee members. At the same time, the refugee area was reorganized into a relief zone, and the former Fourth Route Army Headquarters Rescue Cadre Training Class, the Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps, etc. were assigned to the Rescue General Team. Regarding the plan to relieve refugees, the Association has already carefully planned the overall steps and implemented them step by step, first paying attention to the passive palliative method, and then carrying out the active radical cure procedure. Its past work is as follows:</p>
<p>Passive Aspect</p>
<p>(1) Distributing Cotton Clothes and Medicines to Counties and Associations for Relief, People fled their homes and lost their clothes. During the severe winter season, it is inevitable to freeze and cold. The Association specially made 30,000 pieces of cotton clothes and distributed them to various counties, including Huizhou, Boluo, Zengcheng, Longmen, Nan'ao, Dongguan, Qingyuan, Huaxian, Conghua, Panyu, Wengyuan and other eleven counties, each with 2,000 pieces, Longchuan, Lianping, Shixing, Lechang, Fogang, Ruyuan, Yingde, Shixing and other eight counties with 1,000 pieces each, and overseas Chinese in Hong Kong donated 1,000 pieces and forwarded them to Lianxian, and overseas Chinese in Australia donated 2,000 pieces and forwarded them to Zhongshan. As for medical supplies, 100,000 yuan has now been allocated and personnel have been sent to Hong Kong to purchase them. (2) Issuing Relief Funds to County Associations to Handle Relief, since × bandits invaded southern China, various counties have suffered. The Association specially considered the severity of the disaster in various places and allocated relief funds. Another part was used to handle emergency relief, and another part was stored for essential needs, totaling more than 300,000 yuan in national currency (see today's newspaper for details). (3)</p>
<p>Sending Relief Teams</p>
<p>Going Deep into War Zones to Relieve Refugees, the Association sent rescue teams to go deep into the war zones to work, responsible for rescuing the elderly, weak, women and children on the battlefield, and allocating relief funds. One detachment has been sent to Qingyuan, and two detachments have been sent to Gaoyao and Lingao counties. (4) Registering Unemployed Machine Workers, in order to relieve the unemployed machine workers who have fled from Daozhou after its fall, the Association specially ordered the Provincial Machine Workers Union to register them separately, totaling 498 people in the first phase. In addition to providing temporary relief, it also sent a telegram to the Central Government requesting fundamental relief measures. (5) Allocating Funds to Relieve the Partners of the West River, after the outbreak of the West River War, a large number of refugee boats gathered, totaling more than 400 partners. In addition to the Association transferring relief funds for relief, the Third District Commissioner's Office also ordered the West River Shipping Cooperative to allocate 1,000 yuan of national currency per month from its profits for subsidies. (6) Planning to Relieve Poor and Weak Women, Children, Vagrants and Beggars in Shaoguan City. (7) Consulting with Various Banks to Find Ways to Facilitate Refugees' Storage of Gold Jewelry and Silver Coins, gold jewelry and silver coins carried by refugees from various counties when they fled in the war zones were often looted by thugs along the way, or detained by the team. The Association specially requested the Provincial Government to strictly order the teams in various counties to properly protect the refugees along the way, and also requested various banks to find ways to set up special personnel in the refugee shelters in various counties to store the gold jewelry and silver coins of the refugees, so that the refugees can withdraw them for use when they reach their destination. (8) Planning to Set Up Refugee Transit Stations and Shelters in Various Counties, The Association is concerned that refugees fleeing from the war zones along the way are in dire straits due to lack of care, and has decided to set up</p>
<p>Transit Refugees</p>
<p>Stations and shelters are located at suitable locations every 30 Chinese miles along the routes taken by refugees in various counties, and are responsible for setting up shelters by the relief associations in various counties and cities. (9) Holding a Flat Sale in the West River, the Association is now providing relief to the West River with food, and has specially prepared four measures and submitted them to the Provincial Government for approval. (1) It is proposed that the Association allocate 20,000 yuan of national currency and hand it over to the Third District Commissioner to work with Commander Deng to supervise the counties with food shortages and handle the flat sale. (2) It is specially ordered that various counties report the quantity of grain needed, the current rice price, and the measures for holding the flat sale for verification. (3) Resume the purchase of Guilin rice by Guihang Camp in order to provide assistance nearby. (4) Consult with the Food Administration of the Fourth War Zone to formulate a method for transporting grain and lecturing on rice cultivation in order to facilitate the process.</p>
<p>Active Aspect</p>
<p>(1) The Association recently sent special commissioners Zhan Weichao, Huang Deshen, and Chen Yixiu to various counties in the East, West, and North Rivers and Hong Kong and Macau to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the actual conditions of refugees and the exact number of refugee children, in order to provide relief separately, and to organize a refugee children's education group. (2) Sending personnel to plan the establishment of refugee children's relief schools in Hong Kong and Macau, the Association believes that Hong Kong and Macau are closely connected, there are many refugee children in the war zones, and there are many unemployed staff members, so it specially sent Provincial Government Counselor Tan Boyang to Hong Kong and Macau to plan the establishment of schools with the Central Committee members staying in Hong Kong and Macau and local celebrities. It is estimated that it can accommodate 10,000 refugee children and 300 staff members. (3) Setting up a Miscellaneous People Reclamation Farm, this is the only radical cure method. In addition to the Association previously setting up a</p>
<p>Refugee Reclamation</p>
<p>In addition to the farm, it is also planned to set up human-scale reclamation farms in places such as the Forestry Bureau of Suxian County, and the planning is now underway. (4) Providing Loans for Seeds, Farming Cattle, and Agricultural Tools, the Association is now consulting with the Construction, Forestry and Banking Provinces. Regarding the relief fund for refugees throughout the province, the Association has decided to divide it into two parts, passive and active, totaling 17,120,000 yuan, and has requested subsidies from the Central Government, so as to ensure that refugees in this province can be properly handled, it is said.</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from Shaoguan) Yesterday (9th) the weather was clear, and × planes attacked northern Guangdong again. Shaoguan issued a total of three air raid warnings from 9:00 am to noon. It was found that three × planes in the first attack dropped bombs near Pajang, one × plane in the second attack dropped bombs near Yingde, and three × planes in the third attack dropped bombs in Fogang in two batches. The extent of the damage is unknown. Also, after the air raid alarm was lifted, all agencies in Shao held a meeting at a certain place at 3:00 pm to commemorate "May 9th". Many officials attended the meeting. The atmosphere at the meeting was very solemn and the emotions were tense.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Record of the Tragic Bombing of Chaoshan by × Planes <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>(1) Be Alert!</p>
<p>Our Chaoshan is "naturally blessed." Looking at the broken rivers and mountains of Shenzhou, look, it is still perfectly intact...</p>
<p>The Japanese won't come. No, he doesn't want to destroy the only market for his goods... ×××× may not be very clever. No, it is panic, it is a blind collision. Why should he cripple such a restored and prosperous city himself... This is not a nursery rhyme, nor is it nonsense from illiterate people. Although it is not a politician's theory, it is generally popular. Street talk and gossip, drum, the tongue like reeds, are the general knowledge water, not too low middle and upper class, people, full of superstition, short-sighted people, now they have to get it.</p>
<p>(2) The Beginning of the Tragic Bombing</p>
<p>When something "loyal Holy King carriage" (that is, a kind of help, the edict, guessed what may be right or wrong big turmoil, is in these several major moments...</p>
<p>It just so happens that Tao Zhu, a Jewish merchant-like Mr., is deducting pearl grains "Hey, the converted smuggled goods from Shanghai - domestic products, the daily import amount has exceeded more than 8 million miles", triumphantly judged that the Japanese would not reduce his economic life opportunities himself...</p>
<p>Information came that the Japanese ×× were to destroy the essence of the three major ports in southeastern China - Junbo, Fuzhou, and Shantou, to carve and fry the ships in Ningfu, and had moved here, but perhaps at this time, "It's another ××× who fabricated the news, he wants to scare people into quickly hunting and opening the city," such a rumour is still popular in the intoxicating sweet dream...</p>
<p>(3) The Four Days of Slaughter</p>
<p>Wu Bridge, Guanghua Wharf, Liann Road, Huawu Bridge, Rongyao Bridge, Medley, countless magnificent buildings have become ruins, shacks and shacks have become piles of coke.</p>
<p>Its bullets rained down, not targeting any target, but the foreign drawnwork foreign firm that the Japanese came to, and we were responsible for maintaining the safety of the female workers was also completely destroyed. At the pier, in the slums, the scars were intertwined, and the bloodstains were mostly poor businesses with no resistance. Even the paralyzed Berneau public of the leprosy hospital could not escape the robbery.</p>
<p>Surveying the bombed area, the stench was overflowing, and the crying was deafening. When I arrived at the courtyard, I saw broken limbs and moans. This bloody debt of the desperate world, we will not remember to liquidate it.</p>
<p>Shantou:</p>
<p>More than 70 bullets fell, more than 50 people died, more than 120 people were injured, and more than 200 houses were destroyed.</p>
<p>Chaoan:</p>
<p>More than 20 were weak, more than 10 houses were destroyed, and more than 10 people were killed or injured.</p>
<p>Chaoyang:</p>
<p>Four bullets fell into the hospital, and more than 40 patients were killed or injured.</p>
<p>Chenghai:</p>
<p>The electric wheels were strafed, killing and wounding more than 30 people.</p>
<p>Now the market is still stagnant, and the businesses are still closed. The city of Shantou, where × people will not come to destroy his economic vitality, whether the government's measures to evacuate the population and transfer supplies are appropriate is now clear to the chest of the Dragon.</p>
<p>(4) The Divide Between Morality and Savagery</p>
<p>I feel that the backward Western civilization has a broad range of moral qualities. The following is the fact.</p>
<p>Just when the Fa ××× was frantically killing, Yanfeng Mountain was beautiful, and there were mountains of people and seas. They were all non-resistant bombers who had crossed the sea early in the morning and returned in the evening, but when the × people's iron crows were soaring, they did not let go. In the past four days, the masses who were strafed to death were also equally unresistant, but the moral countries "helped with their hands" when they saw danger.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 7th, boats were like shuttles, and refugees returned one after another. Suddenly, the sky was covered with haze, a storm suddenly arose, and heavy rain followed. The sea was in great disorder, and the disaster of the waves turning over the boats was staged after the man-made disaster. Seeing this, the "Sterling" British warship hurriedly sent boats to rescue the waves and rescued more than 30 people. After warmly inviting them to board the ship, the wind calmed down in the evening before sending them ashore. From here, we divide the differences between moral countries and savage nations.</p>
<p>(5) Not Sharing the Same Sky</p>
<p>Fellow Chaoshan compatriots, we should be alert now. We must break the myth, we must abandon safety, we must trust the government, obey the government, and stand up with a brave posture to meet the great era. The national crisis has not been eliminated and the family hatred has not been avenged. We will never swear to share the same sky with the Japanese ××.</p>
<p>General Hua Zhenzhong's knowledge, "Do not rely on × not to come, rely on me to prepare for it." We will always keep this in mind and prepare it.</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Great Mobilization of the Isolated Island's Theatrical World: The Eurasia Art Company to Expand its Organization, Establishing an International Theatre and Chinese Song and Dance Troupe <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] The Eurasia Art Company, which recently performed the opera "Carmen" at the Grand Theatre, is planning a major reorganization. This plan includes not only continuing to perform French operas, but also building its own theater and organizing a Chinese opera troupe, as well as establishing a Chinese opera training class.</p>
<p>This plan will not only be a pioneer for the foundation of Chinese and Western operas, but will also be a powerful force in consolidating and expanding Shanghai's theatrical scene. Because their plan includes the frequent staging of spoken dramas at the International Theatre in the future. This will provide great convenience for those involved in spoken drama who lament the lack of a stage. Moreover, since the construction of the theatre is intended for both opera and spoken drama performances, the various facilities will naturally be much more complete than those currently borrowed from cinemas.</p>
<p>When these plans are implemented, the name of the Eurasia Art Company will also be changed. The new name has been decided upon as International Art Company. Although the various organizations under the International Art Company's name will maintain their independence to a considerable extent, they will all be prefixed with the word "International" in their names.</p>
<p>The plan is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign Opera Troupe: This is the same troupe that recently performed "Carmen" at the Grand Theatre. They will soon travel to Saigon, Hanoi, and other places for performances. Their representative, LeBibot, has already set off to make arrangements. The troupe's plan is to first establish regularly performing bases in Saigon, Hanoi, and Shanghai. Then, they can take turns performing. In terms of internal organization, they want to strengthen it with the French as the center, and then supplement it with Chinese or other nationalities. In addition to Hanoi and Saigon, they will also venture to Java and Singapore for performances.</p>
<p>(2) International Theatre: This theatre is under active development. The location has been decided: it is in a quiet but central and easily accessible area within the French Concession's high-end theatre district. Currently, blueprints are being drafted, and it is expected to be completed this year. Public fundraising for the theatre's construction will commence soon. Because it is intended for opera and spoken drama performances, the backstage and stage equipment will surpass all existing theatres.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese Opera Troupe: This opera troupe is now largely organized, and the script is being written. The troupe's address, name, and the list of participants are currently being kept secret. They will be announced when the time is right.</p>
<p>Although the actors in the Chinese opera troupe will all be newcomers (to avoid conflicts with spoken drama personnel and dispersing manpower), they have decided to establish an opera training school to train new cadres. They will recruit young people interested in opera for training, to serve as a vital force for the future development of the opera movement. Having seen "The Poppy Flower," we believe that Chinese opera has unlimited prospects. Therefore, it is crucial to train the basic forces now to avoid a talent shortage in the future.</p>
<p>As the opera movement develops, the full implementation of the International Art Company's various plans will be its vanguard.</p>
<p>This is welcome news. I believe readers will be happy to hear this.</p>

<p>— Continued</p>
<p>Constance Bennett: "Topper" is considered her most glamorous and satirical work.</p>
<p>Margaret Sullavan: Some believe that Margaret Sullavan's performance in "So Red the Rose" is comparable to Norma Shearer's in "Marie Antoinette," which is considered an overestimation, but "The Shopworn Angel," co-starring with James Stewart, is considered Margaret Sullavan's representative work.</p>
<p>Olivia de Havilland: Olivia de Havilland in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" as Hermia does not reach the suitability of today's Olivia for colored films. However, she surpassed Loretta Young, and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" can also be called Olivia's representative work.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford: She has rarely acted in recent films. Her past films are generally average, but "Grand Hotel" can be called an outstanding masterpiece.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert: Colbert's recent "Midnight" is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Constance Bennett: Constance Bennett has been well-received by audiences after playing a flirtatious ghost. Her performance in "Topper" seems more vivid than in "Merrily We Live."</p>
<p>Priscilla Lane: This beautiful new star's "Four Daughters" is certainly her representative work, but she is also not weak in "Brother Rat." It is a pity that she has fewer acting opportunities.</p>
<p>Anna Sten: "Nana" can be considered Anna Sten's representative work, because "The Wedding Night," from the perspective of Chinese audiences, is not realistic enough as a Chinese rural woman.</p>
<p>Joan Blondell: Joan's "Miss Pacific Fleet" has been praised by audiences.</p>
<p>Kay Francis: Kay has been quite disappointing recently. However, "Confession" can be called Kay's representative recent work.</p>

<p>According to recent news from Hollywood, Paramount has signed a contract with the famous Chinese female aviator Miss Li Xiaqing, who will play a key role in Dorothy Lamour's new film Disputed Pasage.</p>
<p>The story behind this is very interesting. One day, Paramount executives saw Miss Li's beautiful image in the newspaper and thought she was very suitable for filming. They invited her to the studio for a "screen test." Miss Li thought there was little hope of success. Originally, she was not eager to be on screen, but Paramount gave her a contract.</p>
<p>Disputed Pasase will start filming soon. So, in addition to Huang Liushuang, there is another Chinese female star in Hollywood.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Miss Li Xiaqing joined the Chinese film industry ten years ago under the name Li Danqie. At that time, she was as famous as Lin Chuchu and starred in films such as "Poet at the End of the World." Later, she joined the aviation industry and became a female hero, winning great glory for China. This invitation from Hollywood was unexpected.)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Grass Court Tennis Singles Final: Clash of Chinese Talents, Held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club at 4:30 PM. If the He-Li Team Reproduces its Excellent Performance, the Xu Family Team May Not Easily Prevail. <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The highlight of today's open grass court tennis tournament is the doubles championship match, featuring the Xu brothers (Wei Pei and Run Pei) versus He Jialiu and Li Rurong.</p>
<p>The Xu brothers are currently the two players with the highest skill level in Hong Kong's tennis world. Therefore, they have already secured the top two spots in the singles competition. They are also the top contenders for the doubles championship.</p>
<p>This year's tournament has attracted more participants in both singles and doubles than in the past, which is a good sign. As the competition reaches its final stages, our Chinese talents have all emerged, eliminating all the Western players and creating an excellent situation of sweeping the top two spots in both singles and doubles, creating a page of unprecedented glory in history.</p>
<p>He and Li both performed admirably in their victory over the Lin Zhen brothers. He's strengths on that day were his ability to defend the baseline and cope with the Lin Zhen brothers' attacks. His technique of long shots with left and right angles, combined with his rich experience, was frequently displayed, showing that he has regained his former prowess. As for Li's performance, the most commendable aspect was his sharp and lively play at the net, which was enough to defeat the Lin Zhen brothers. His personal technique is certainly at its peak. Moreover, his cooperation with He is exceptionally smooth. Their positioning and retreat are well-coordinated, without any mutual mistakes. Therefore, their elimination of the Lin Zhen brothers to gain the finals qualification was not accidental, but a well-deserved reward for their outstanding skills.</p>
<p>Today they meet the Xu brothers. If their performance is as brilliant as it was when they fought the Lin Zhen brothers, then, although the Xu brothers come with the prestige of last year's championship, they may not easily prevail.</p>
<p>Before defeating the Lin Zhen brothers, He and Li may not have had any extravagant hopes. After eliminating the Lin Zhen brothers, their ambition to win the championship grew. Therefore, in today's match, one side wants to maintain the championship and uphold their reputation, while the other side wants to ascend the throne and claim the title. Moreover, with last week's performance, He and Li are even more confident. Although the skills of the Xu brothers are extraordinary, He and Li have already reached this championship stage and will certainly do their best to cope. If they win, it will be infinite glory. Even if they lose, they will still have the runner-up title in hand. Therefore, they will be satisfied with either the championship or the runner-up title. Conversely, the Xu brothers are in their golden age and want to preserve their reputation. Seeing the sudden rise of He and Li, they know it will not be easy. Meeting at a narrow pass, they inevitably have some anxiety about gains and losses. They will definitely attach more importance to the outcome of the match than He and Li, because they are afraid that even one mistake will not only undo their previous efforts, but also jeopardize their reputation of several years. Therefore, it can be predicted that the Xu brothers' desire to win will be even more urgent than that of He and Li in today's competition.</p>
<p>Judging by both sides' techniques, everyone knows that the Xu brothers are better, and they have cooperated for many years, with the benefit of tacit understanding. Moreover, Da Xu's superb technique of combining strength and flexibility can be fully utilized against any strong enemy, allowing him to control the opponent. Therefore, I believe that the tenacious strategy adopted by He and Li may be sufficient to deal with the Lin Zhen brothers, but not enough to deal with the Xu brothers. In terms of net smashes and baseline attacks, the Xu brothers are also superior. These are all important conditions for them to seize victory.</p>
<p>In short, this match will unfold into a very exciting scene, worth appreciating.</p>
<p>The match starts at 4:30 PM, still at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. Tickets are available for $1.00 and $1.50. (Commentary from the Cricket Club)</p>

<h3 id="e61">The Cross-Port Football Team Returned to Hong Kong Yesterday: Li Huitang Discusses the Reasons for the Failure <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The Hong Kong football team that went to the Philippines returned to Hong Kong on the 7th aboard the Taiping wheel. They entered port at 10:00 AM yesterday. The ship docked at the Taikoo Wharf in Kowloon. Many officials from the General Association and reporters went to greet them.</p>
<p>According to team captain Li Huitang, the Philippine side was very hospitable on this trip, which will never be forgotten. As for the failure of our team in the first two games, each had its own reasons. In the first game, Liang Rongzhao was unable to participate due to an old foot injury, and Ni, who was ill, was used instead. As a result, the defensive strength of the forward line was reduced. Although Biludu was exhausted, the supply was not adequate. And after five minutes of the game, I took the ball and went up, just as I was about to shoot, I was stopped by several defenders, and my foot was injured, losing its original mobility, resulting in being attacked from both sides, and thus failing. In the second game, many of our teammates were not used to playing in heavy rain and at night. I did not play due to injury, so we also lost 1-3. The strength of the Philippine inter-port team is comparable to the one that came to Hong Kong to compete last time. In theory, their individual skills are not as good as ours on average. However, they had the advantage of favorable weather and terrain, and used a high-speed strategy, thus winning the victory. In the third game, our team moved Biludu to the right inside forward, and the formation was not complete, but we still won 4-1, which was due to the efforts of all the teammates, he said.

<h3 id="e62">Yesterday's Basketball Game: Group A Guangda Defeats Police, Group B Journalists Break Long Losing Streak <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In the public men's basketball game, in the first game last night in Group B, the Journalists played against Red Star. With the return of Ma Zhaohua, the Journalists were stronger. They took the lead with 40-13 in the first half. Red Star forfeited in the second half. The Journalists won, breaking their long losing streak in this competition. In the second game, in Group A, Guangda played against the Police. The two teams were close in strength, and the competition was fierce. Shortly after the start of the game, the Police were behind 4-14. When Baobaoxing arrived on the scene, the defense became stable. They first tied the score at 19-19. At the end of the first half, they even took the lead with 25-21. After the change of baskets, Guangda was still behind. Until ten minutes before the end of the game, they first reversed the defeat with 29-28 and 39-34. As a result, the Police lost with 40-47.</p>
<p>In yesterday's game, Zheng Yutang performed best for Guangda. His shots were skillful, and his rebounds were also good. Liang Xuanzhao and Liang Renqiang were especially able to supply the forwards, which was very good. The team's use of a roundabout passing to avoid the opponent's strong steals was the reason for their victory.</p>
<p>The Police were far less powerful because of the absence of Na and Xing. Although Gui Tingkai and Chen Jinkui made long shots, they were not reliable. Although Baobaoxing's offense and defense were not perfect, he made many contributions to the Police. The rest of the players were only strong and powerful, but their skills were not good, and each player often acted alone, especially when they were at the core, they were unwilling to pass the ball, so they were resisted by the opponent, which was the team's fatal weakness. The strategic miscalculation was undeniable. Relying on strength alone will not help in the end. In the last game, Group B Guangzhong defeated Dazhong with 32-24. The results of the other Group A game are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangda Shot Penalty Fouls Points</p>

<h3 id="e63">Popularizing School Sports: Universal Classes Should Be Added <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>(3) The Remedial Course Supplements the Regular Course Hours. In the general environment of Hong Kong schools, the training methods, teaching materials, teaching courses, etc., can only be considered for the average student. It is impossible to take into account all aspects or a small number of students. From this point of view, although the effectiveness of universal and ordinary training can be achieved during regular class hours, if there are no other remedial measures, will there not be a part of the students who will never receive the benefits of physical education training, even if there are fewer opportunities than ordinary students? In other words, the weaker students will have no way to improve their health. We must not only think about these students. The only way is to add universal classes and give them the most appropriate training and special opportunities. This is the duty of physical educators.</p>
<p>Comrades, I believe that everyone is serving physical education and educating for the health of young people. We must be able to be loyal to physical education. Since we are loyal to physical education, we must be strict and careful in our mission to nurture the physical fitness of every young child. We cannot be casual. It is our wish that there are no pale-faced scholars and frail girls among the children under our responsibility. In other words, physical education training must be universal before we can be loyal to our duties. If we want to make physical education universal and achieve the benefits of universal physical education, we must not think from only one aspect, but we must think of methods from all aspects. Apart from other things, I think the most effective way is to add universal classes. Therefore, I am publishing all my humble opinions here for the comrades to correct me. (End of Part 3)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Philippine Davis Cup Players Will Pass Through Hong Kong to the United States; May Arrive in Hong Kong Tomorrow; Unknown Whether They Will Perform <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Philippine Davis Cup players San Jose and Ambrocio will pass through Hong Kong to the United States on the President Pierce wheel on Thursday of this week.</p>
<p>San Jose and Javier participated in the Saigon Tennis Championships. When they passed through Hong Kong last month, they played exhibition matches with the Xu brothers, Cai Yongshan, Situ Bi, and Giese at the Kowloon Cricket Club. If the audience is not forgetful, they may still remember that San Jose's tennis skills were lower than Javier's, and the audience did not appreciate him. Unexpectedly, San Jose suddenly won the Philippine championship last month and has now been selected as a Davis Cup singles player. It is said that one should be seen in a new light after three days apart.</p>
<p>Ambrocio, who is traveling with San Jose this time, is 17 years old and full of vigor. In the Philippines, he defeated Javier 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, and 6-1 to win the runner-up title. Later, in order to be cautious, the Philippine Davis Cup Selection Committee asked Gia to compete with Ambrocio again to explore the other side's true strength. As a result, Jia requested a postponement twice.</p>
<p>The selection committee considered that the President Pierce wheel was scheduled to depart soon and could not wait any longer, so it selected Xiang Bang as the Davis Cup player. The wheel is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at 6:00 PM tomorrow and will depart at 1:00 AM. If the Hong Kong Grass Court Tennis Association can make preparations early and invite them to show off their skills, it is possible. According to the Davis Cup schedule, these Philippine players will play against Australian or Mexican players.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Counterattack in Literature and Art <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Li</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has entered a new stage. In the second phase of the war, we have decided to defend every city in the rear, launch a broader guerrilla war in the occupied areas, and coordinate with the regular armies on all fronts to implement a full-scale counterattack. Politically, we will actively eliminate corrupt elements who waver in their confidence in the War of Resistance, and crack down on all conspirators and so-called "cultural traitors." Thus, the second phase of the War of Resistance is active, preparing to implement a counterattack in military and political strategy.</p>
<p>Since literature and art are considered a type of weapon, and are recognized as having propaganda value, and in fact, literature and art can be integrated into any kind of battle, then literature and art reflecting this sacred national liberation war should leave a realistic record of this great era from both the front and the sides, and of course should also be integrated into the counterattack battle. This is naturally the responsibility of a literary worker, or at least should be something a literary worker pays attention to. We must increase the strength of the War of Resistance within all possible scopes!</p>
<p>We can also get an enlightenment from the literary practice of ×, and we are not willing to strengthen our literary battle power. Our × people have not given up their strategy of treating literature and art as a battle object. Although the transportation of "Mr. Hua Wei's" corpse to Japan is laughable and shameful, we cannot continue to ignore it. We urgently need the mobilization and organization of literary workers to form a strong opposing front, and immediately counterattack, in coordination with the military and political strategies of the counterattack.</p>
<p>The enemy's writers have already been mobilized under the military's swords, receiving support from the military and also accepting the military's "suggestions." Batches of them are sent to the battlefields of China. It is only natural that a "pen corps" arriving with tanks, airplanes, and invading troops will produce a large amount of "lying literature" (the topic of lying and literature is quite complex, but here the so-called lying literature obviously refers to something else).</p>
<p>But the invading pen that follows the invading army cannot distort tyranny into peace, or distort hegemony into justice. A tail hidden under the shirt will eventually fall off one day.</p>
<p>Our war for justice has gained valuable international sympathy and support, and the literature and art that are integrated into the battle for justice will also gain the same sympathy and support. This is an absolute advantage. We should maintain this advantage, and as the War of Resistance enters a more active phase, in coordination with the counterattack, counterattack the "pen corps" that came for aggression.</p>
<p>Until those invading troops, and the pen corps that follows behind, are defeated and roll away.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Between Father and Son <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Lu Youde unexpectedly became old. Although others said that he was still very strong, he himself was unwilling to wander outside anymore. All the guarantees he had previously made for others were announced and resigned, and even the honorary position of director to which he was invited by some charitable and relief societies was firmly rejected.</p>
<p>"In this era...it's always better to have one less thing to worry about!" he often said.</p>
<p>Indeed, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Lu Youde had completely changed. He only planned to sit comfortably at home and live the life of an "old master" for the rest of his life, and of course! This idea was not wrong. He had plenty of houses, servants, and money, so naturally he lacked nothing and no longer needed anything else.</p>
<p>Lu Youde had a wife. She had once been praised by a true iron-willed fortune teller, who said that not a single eyebrow hair was missing, so she would definitely have "limitless blessings" in the future. No wonder her body was simply as fat as an old sow, how could someone without blessings deserve it?</p>
<p>This was a long time ago. Now? Lu Youde's son was already seventeen years old!</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Lu Yaocong was completely unlike his father, at least not as afraid of things as Lu Youde was.</p>
<p>While Lu Youde was closing his doors tightly and living a leisurely life at home, his son was elected as the director of the fundraising group of the student national salvation association. Lu Youde never dreamed that his son would be so "brave." When Yaocong smiled and handed a book of donation pledges to his father, Lu Youde, after reading it, suddenly changed his tone to a stern one and said:</p>
<p>"Damao! Are you crazy?"</p>
<p>"No! Father, this is the duty of every citizen: give money if you have money! Give strength if you have strength! I hope Father will donate more."</p>
<p>"Damao! You are really getting more confused as you grow older. The current situation is like this...who knows when it will be settled...everyone should save some money, how can there be extra money to donate? What, Damao, you are even persuading the fundraising director, that's terrible, the lives of the whole family will be lost because of you. Hmph! Your name is on this donation list, if something happens I can't bear the responsibility...Actually, you are too senseless, the family has food, clothing, everything you need, why can't you be content but go and do that dangerous and useless thing?..."</p>
<p>"Dad, have you said enough? Listen to me—"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! You still want to argue with me?"</p>
<p>"Dad! It's fine if you don't donate, why talk so much? If people as rich as you are unwilling to give money, China will soon...</p>
<p>"Beast! Shut your mouth!"</p>
<p>"Humph! You don't love the country yourself, but you don't allow others to love the country, isn't that senseless? Stop dreaming! The days of enjoying happiness can't last a lifetime. Don't think that just because you have money you can..."</p>
<p>"Beast! You're actually scolding me? Get out of here with me!" Youde was so angry that his face turned from red to purple.</p>
<p>After this quarrel, the father and son did not exchange a single word even when they met. Yaocong seemed calm on the surface, but in reality he worked even harder than before in secret. Youde? He scolded and kicked the table and chairs at home all day long, but no one paid attention to him.</p>
<p>One day, Youde finally calmed down his anger. He called his son to his room affectionately.</p>
<p>"Damao! You're so old, don't you know how to be filial? Why do you have to go against your father? You have to know that I'm only trying to teach you well. Think about it, what father in the world doesn't love his children. I hope you don't make Dad sad..."</p>
<p>"Dad! I understand your situation and what you're saying. It's true, from the perspective of the family, what you said is not entirely wrong. But, from the perspective of the whole country, you shouldn't use your selfishness to force your son to stay at home." Yaocong's eyes were filled with a sacred light when he spoke.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The son disappeared at the same time as the one hundred yuan hidden in the quilt. And, both of them are gone forever.</p>
<p>Because of this incident, Youde lost his temper again for several days. He cursed at Mrs. Lu:</p>
<p>"It's all your fault, you old woman, for giving birth to such a good son!"</p>
<p>After hearing her husband's scolding, Mrs. Lu began to have great doubts about the phrase "limitless blessings" that she had firmly believed in for more than ten years.</p>
<h3 id="e70">A Child's View <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Wenge</p>
<p>In response to the doom of "wandering around," a telegram for the implementation of spiritual mobilization of the people was sent. This is as meaningful as the sound of gongs in the quiet night awakening people in a dream. Especially in Hong Kong, this southern isolated island, it should be seriously noted. Originally, thinking about spiritual mobilization is only the minimum standard of patriotism. Logically, every Chinese should have already automatically fulfilled it without waiting for someone to mention it. But the fact that people only pay attention to it after Chairman Chiang's telegram is a shameful thing for our people!</p>
<p>Now, the implementation of this spiritual mobilization is being actively promoted, and most of the people have a considerable understanding of this mobilization. However—it cannot be denied that in practice, it still only focuses on literate intellectuals; as for the masses with relatively low levels of knowledge or even illiterates, at least I dare say that there has not been much impact. Although they will not all do crazy treasonous acts because spiritual mobilization does not affect them, it cannot be said that there are absolutely no skeptics about the belief in victory. Therefore, in order to extinguish the poison of this kind of blind skepticism, we must not only focus on propaganda for the so-called upper-class intellectuals, but also go a step further and penetrate into the propaganda among the so-called lower-class uneducated masses, so that people all over the country, regardless of upper and lower classes, can understand the fundamental meaning of spiritual mobilization and immediately take action. To achieve this, we cannot only have superficial written propaganda, but should also try to use other better methods. Because written propaganda is aimed at intellectuals. The illiterate masses, apart from seeing a few square characters, will of course know nothing.</p>
<p>Writing this, some people may say, "Spiritual mobilization has only been mentioned recently, why be so impatient?" But I think that this mobilization should have been implemented at the beginning of the War of Resistance, but it has been delayed until now. Although it cannot be said to be moved, it cannot be said to be too early, and of course it cannot continue to be done slowly and leisurely. Therefore, a two-pronged approach is an inevitable fact. Moreover, now that the Wang faction and other traitors are using clever counterintelligence to deceive the people, we must not sit idly by and watch them run rampant in broad daylight, and only use spiritual mobilization to meet them head-on. I think this is what should be done no matter what.</p>
<p>In short: Regarding spiritual mobilization, people with considerable knowledge can implement it immediately without hesitation. If there are still people who only harden their heads and do it after someone promotes it, then this person seems too useless. Therefore, I think that the most correct target for mobilization propaganda should be the people whose knowledge is below the standard.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that every gentleman who understands the meaning of spiritual mobilization will find a way to take some of their spare time to promote everything about this issue to our masses whose knowledge is below the standard. Especially those of us who are living on this isolated island, the "happy" islanders, who seem to be unaffected by any fear at present, should undoubtedly do something for this matter.</p>
<p>Work hard, work hard to promote our spirit of fighting for freedom.</p>
<p>I am a child, and a child's views will make people laugh until their stomachs hurt. Fortunately, adults and gentlemen probably won't care about anything, so I hereby apologize.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Mountain City (Continued) <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Fei</p>
<p>"The weather has changed this year too, in this kind of weather, it will start to snow," the old man hunched over his cold waist.</p>
<p>Inside the city, practical things were laid out in stalls on the streets. Without any markings, they were naturally completely authentic local products: green porcelain bowls that were very cute, small flower vases, salt-bottom white-patterned cloth, yellow rice like a small bowl, as well as bamboo baskets, straw-woven mats, and wheat-straw mats. Everything that farmers had worked hard to produce was displayed.</p>
<p>People were calling, horses were neighing, and livestock were stealing a moment of leisure, freely chewing on green grass. Those who didn't have grass to eat stood quietly in a corner.</p>
<p>A thin pig, tied to a pole, was led by a butcher, making a terrible cry. The old owner sent it off with affectionate eyes. The pig was sold, and what was exchanged was just a few banknotes. He patted the horse's back with a melancholic look, warming it with warm breaths. The horse obediently leaned against its master's side.</p>
<p>The small restaurants and snacks on the side of the street were extremely lively, with stoves burning red and food steaming.</p>
<p>Five cents for mutton, another dime for yellow wine, to ward off the cold. A bowl of rice noodles, a bowl of local noodles, and then the shop owner was too busy. Or buy a piece of steel-plate tofu or pig's blood, and you can have a full meal.</p>
<p>"The provincial capital was bombed yesterday." No news could make them pay more attention than this. A crowd of people surrounded the radio.</p>
<p>"Three enemy planes were shot down!" A young man shouted happily.</p>
<p>They walked away very satisfied. The war was still far away for them.</p>
<p>The gray sky was a little gloomy. The mountain city gradually quieted down, and the farmers dragged their horses back to the countryside. The cold wind was blowing over their shivering bodies in the pine forest outside the city and on the sparkling lake. The haggard crowds staggered and disappeared into the small paths along the fields. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Snow in Manchuria <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>Then, they couldn't help but lift her up like they were welcoming Yuwen, swinging her in the air: forcing her to laugh, not a hearty laugh, forcing her to shout, not a natural shout, and not allowing her to breathe freely. All her movements were not her own. They swung her almost dizzy before they stopped. She was tired and couldn't stand up. She lay on the bed, initially embracing the love of her comrades, which was more intimate than family affection. This was her first warm dream on the road of life.</p>
<p>"...You are all my elder brothers, maybe there are my younger brothers, how should I call you?...I can't leave you, no!....If I don't have you by my side, who else will there be?...I can't leave you, no, no, I want to be with you in life and death, forever together!...Yuwen, why are you so foolish?...So foolish, really foolish, you are the first foolish person in the world!...Why did you still use a gun?...So foolish!...It would have been better if you had secretly written a letter, telling me clearly...Ah! Didn't I come immediately?...Look, you were even wounded by a knife...wounded by a knife!...Don't blame me, it's all because you're foolish!...No, you're all foolish! Foolish!...No, I'm also foolish, why did I stab you with a knife?...I'm foolish!..."</p>
<p>—She was excited and distraught in that dream. At this time, she was lying down, with her eyes closed, her hands crossed on her chest, not moving at all. There was still a satisfied smile on her face, like a smile in a photograph, never changing, and never fading.</p>
<p>They followed her dazed state and lifted her into the air again, continuing to swing her. They wanted to continue pouring all their enthusiasm for her in the continued swinging until nothing was left.</p>
<p>She was swung so hard that she lost her senses and forgot her shape, letting her body rise high and fall low, appearing and disappearing, swinging back and forth, letting them play with her in whatever way they wanted. In that play, high and holy, she did not need to have unnecessary worries; she had already forgotten the gender of people—the unfree separation. She didn't want to refuse, and it seemed that only in this way could she feel the unprecedented happiness. Now, she knew what true happiness, precious happiness, was. Even if someone were happy for a lifetime, it would be difficult to match this moment of her happiness—if it could last forever, she thought, the world would hardly have any happier people.</p>
<p>However, when she woke up, she still looked as if she hadn't slept all night. The reason for not sleeping well was not because she was disturbed by the emotions of last night; sometimes, people are so happy that they can't sleep.</p>
<p>The lights in the room, the flowers in the vase, and everything else were happy, all guarding her eyes, and especially clear. So, she closed her eyes, and the sound of the outside air lulled her to sleep.</p>
<p>She fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning. (Sixty-one)</p>
