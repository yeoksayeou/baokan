<p>社評</p>
<h3>華僑與論界對祖國應盡的責任</h3>
<p>抗戰以來，海外華僑對於新聞報章的需要日益迫切，各地新聞事業亦已蓬蓬勃勃的發達起來，其中尤以密邇祖國的本港爲尤然，於是華僑輿論界在祖國在僑界以平圃際上的地位，亦日漸提高了。</p>
<p>二十餘月以來，華僑輿論界除絕少數的由漢奸私辦的報紙以外，大都能够以國家民族的利益爲第一位，齊一步驟，擁護中央堅持團結抗戰到底的國策，號召各界僑胞盡心竭力參加一切有關抗戰建國的事業，這不僅是華僑輿論界的光榮，也是中國輿論界在國際上的光榮。</p>
<p>但是無庸諱言，我們祖國求生存求解放的抗日戰爭，還正在轉向一個新的更艱難的階段。也就是决定我們國家民族生死存亡的階段。在這階段中，蔣委員長最近會昭示我們，『所需於全國國民之淬厲奮鬥，以期克復之艱難，較之前期，亦日見擴大，×人今日已知軍事力量不足以屈服吾人而達其解决之目的，故其最近計劃乃欲以種種方法搖撼吾人之意志威脅我人之精神』，因此，我們必須實施國民精神總動員綱領，提高全民族的自尊心自信心，以澈底粉碎×人的攻略。我們華僑輿論界，自更應首先認淸本身在目前階段所處重要的地位，斷然負起推進國民精神總動員的責任。我們認定國民精神總動員是决定國家民族生死存亡的當前第一件大事，而推進國民精神總動員正是輿論界尤其是華僑輿論界唯一的中心任務。</p>
<p>認淸了這個關係重大的中心任務以後，隨着更應該認淸我們的國民精神的總動員，實際上也就是一個全民族的政治動員，首先就是廣泛的思想動員。我們要克服抗戰現階段中的一切艱難，擊破×人的一切詭計，堅持團結抗戰，爭取最後勝利，首先必須更加提高國的民族自尊心，加強國民對於最後勝利的自信心。誠如精神總動員綱領中所說『今日之所宜致力者尤當注重於精神之振作與集中』，所以我們華僑輿論對祖國第一個應盡的責任，便是應該根據『國家至上，民族至上，軍事第一，勝利第一，意志集中，力量集中』，的三大原則，打擊一切背叛國家民族，破壞軍事勝利，動搖意志和分散力量的『反共』『和平』『調解』等漢奸思想言論，克服一切悲觀失望的情緒，發揚三民主義的革命精神。這是一。</p>
<p>我們目前的中心任務的國民精神總動員，是針對着×人漢奸的政治進攻的陰謀而發的，因此×人漢奸也必然要用一切詭計來加以破壞，主要的如藉口糾正紛歧錯雜思想來挑撥民族統一戰線內部各黨派各階層以至各團體之間的惑情，引起相互間的猜忌傾軋吞併等違反抗戰建國需要的事態。因此我們輿論界，尤其是處身×奸勢力囂張萬分的特殊環境中的輿論界，目前對祖國第一個責任，就是應該指出所謂國家至上，民族至上，正是針對着×奸的陰謀而用以反對分裂國家民族破壞統一戰線的陰謀的份孑的；所謂糾正紛歧錯雜的思想，正是指着『反共』「和平』等漢奸思想的；進而應該指出在不違背三民主義的革命精神，和不破壞統一戰綫，不妨害抗戰的大前提下，還應保障並促進各黨派各團體的存在和發展，俾得各以其最善的努力而貢獻於抗戰建國大業，應該鼓勵各種意見各種學理的互相討論互相觀摩，以收集思廣益的效果。這是二。</p>
<p>當然，我們目前中心任務的精神總動員，决不是唯心的純思想的運動，而一個全民族力量的廣泛動員的實際工作。我們要用國民精神總動員來發動廣大的國民力量，進而加以必要的組織與訓練，以便高度地發揮這種力量，而給×人漢奸以澈底的致命的打擊。誠如「綱領」中所說『必以有組織的精神，發揮有組織之人力，利用有組織之物質，方足以適應國家當前之需要』。因此我們輿論界尤其是華僑與論界，目前對祖國第三個應盡的責任，還要根據精神總動員綱頭，適應各地的特殊環境，建立或充實一切動員工作的組織，爭取大量的民主自由，使其充分發揮自動性積極性，並且領導及協助各界各團體，各機關，各學校，各工廠，各商家，實行國民公約宣誓和暴行國民月會，運用互相競賽互相檢查的方法，協助中央領導僑界，切實展開國民精神總動員運動。這是三。</p>
<p>此外，也最重要的，華僑輿論界，全體新聞事業的從業員本身，首先應該大規模的實行國民公約宣誓及舉行國民月會，作爲各界僑胞模範。若千地方的華僑輿論界已有統一的組織，如本港卽有新聞記者公會和靑年記者學會，前者於汪精衛發出響應近衛宣言主張反共××之時，卽電請中央予以嚴懲，足爲華僑輿論界增光，而後者對於各種救亡運動，光爲努力。最近發起記者簽名響應國民精神總動員，更當爲全體有旨氣有良心愛國家愛人格的僑胞所贊助。現在最高領袖再一次確定汪精衛的言論行爲爲降××國，更可明白反汪是精神總動員的實際工作之一，希望今後與論界都能×揚發過去的光榮，竭盡更大的力量，肅淸叛徒敗類，担負起當前的中心任務，——首先是反汪×反漢奸的任務。提高輿論界的地位。提高民族自尊心自信心，實現精神總動員。我們要知道只有加上華僑的努力，國民精神總動員才能切實展開，抗戰建國大業教才能最後完成。努力吧，華僑輿論界！</p>

<p>乙、救濟失學之育年！最初鑒於需要之迫切、卽聯合女靑年會、設法籌欵補助因受戰事直接影響淸寒無力上進之學生、其方法爲、（一）貸給學費、往內地求學之　資、設立工讀畢生額、獎學金等、至今共計受惠學生六百數十人、付出救濟銀數爲一萬七千元、惜因限於財力，登記而抱向隅之學生、有千餘人之多、（二）設立學生經濟宿舍、先在四川路會所，房價極廉、現又闢五洲大樓七八九三層爲學生宿舍、內部寬大、開辦與經常費約爲二萬元，每年經常支出預計爲六千元、希望造靑年學子之團契精神生活、而實現一理想的學生宿合，</p>

<h3>晉察綏省的　×區工作圑</h3>
<p>【晉西通訊】第二戰區動總員委員會要轉移地區去工作了，這不是沒有原因的。在一個地區工作過相當照期，得到了相當收獲之後，她自然應該轉向較爲落後的區域，去展開新的工作，但是最主要的原因還是新形勢下客觀環境的需要。在抗戰進入新階段的目前，在深入×人後方開展×區工作，巳成爲中華民族頭等重要任務的今日，戰動總會是不應該而且也不會留戀舊地，固步自封的。幸而晋西北仍然留有戰動總會兄弟的犧盟會可以繼續領導民運工作，這是使前者可以安心前進的原因，可是後者的任務却因而更加重大了。</p>
<p>戰動總待在接到轉移地區的正式命令後，全體工作同志都感到極大的興奮，戰動總會在過去雖然也曾派了部分的工作同志到綏東察南及雁北，展開×區的工作，但是大部分的工作同志仍然不能離開這窒塞局限的晉西北，現在有機會到廣大的×區去開發新地，自然會使他們手舞足蹈了。轉移的目的地是雁北××和××一帶，工作地區包有雁北十數縣及察哈爾綏遠全境，這些地區本來就是戰動總會工作地區範圍內的地方，所以這一轉移使戰動總會容易完成她原有的任務。</p>
<p>戰動總會在轉移地區之後，便一方面結束所在地區的工作，一方面準備未來的工作，領導晉西北好多縣的動員工作。有着縣各區各級的龐大組織，包有千百優秀靑年幹部的這樣一個動員機關，她的工作是否可以一下子新釘截鐵地結束了呢？爲了不使地方工作受到影響，戰動總會在這個過渡期間一面結東工作，一面佈置新的部分工作，她把定這樣一個宗旨，卽在晉西北停留一天，必定要負責工作一天，在這個期間她的中心任務楚盡力幫助其他民運團體。培植羣衆抗日力量，誓如在幹部問題上，所以動委會的幹部原則上都應當而且也都願意隨著總會出發，但是爲了支持地方民運工作，戰動總會不惜遺留下相當數量的幹部給晉西北最近各縣奉令組織抗×後援會，戰動總會在地給各縣戰助曾的指示信中這樣着重的地指出，『在這期間各縣的戰動會必須迅速發動組織各縣抗×後援會並確實加强的工作，……戰動會一天沒有離開工作地區，就不應該消極起來放棄工作任務，特別在戰動會轉移地區這時候，更應表現我們無限的工作熱情，積極執行政府對于組織抗×後援會的命令……」</p>
<p>各地羣衆聽到戰動會的結束，發生不少懷疑和猜想，部分落後的份子更乘機造謠，戰動總會給各縣的指示信中也特別這樣地指出：『關於轉移地區的準備工作，特別緊要的是向羣衆解釋戰動會轉移地區的意義……如果羣衆團體不能正確地了解我會轉移地區的積極意義，可能在情緒上低落下來，在工作上消極下來：同時部分的落後份子從來就對于政府戰地抗日政策的設施取消極的態度，從來就對戰動會協助政府帮助羣衆團體進行各種抗戰工作不滿，一定要曲解司令長官對戰動會轉移地區的决定。戰動會應該估計到這些問題，估計可能發生的問題，特別審慎地予以解决。』</p>
<p>近幾天來，各縣一部分的地方幹部在結束了工作之後，陸續囘到了總會，嵐市上突然增加了一羣「趕大車的」（戰動總會的工作同志都披一件沒有布面的羊皮大衣。有人曾把他們認爲是趕大車的車夫），在正式出發以前，總會爲了使各縣舊來幹部檢討一年來的工作。交換相互的意見和經驗，便開了各種工作問題的座談會，如組織工作，宣傳工作，除奸工作，×軍工作，政治工作等，集體學習。除此而外，又召開了幾次擴大座談會，討論過的問題有：戰動總會一年來工作的檢討，及對于聽移地區應有的認識，如何開展×區工作，怎樣建立游擊根据地，怎樣粉碎×人懷柔政策等。</p>
<p>戰動總會在轉移地區後，名羲上和組織上都有些變更，名義將改爲×區工作團，組織上現在的總務處，將改爲秘書處，除奸部將改爲特務部，動員分配部取消，各部組織亦略有變更。更加靈活精幹</p>
<p>戰動總會的出發，不是孤軍深入，而且配備有相當武裝的，這些武裝，——包括×個支隊，×個特務隊，人數約有×千人——是她在晉西北一年餘動員成績的具體表現，這些部隊都具有相當的戰鬥經騐。有這樣多的羣衆武裝，有那樣豐富的工作經驗，「戰動總會在×人後方，一定可以發動廣大的×區羣衆，廣泛地　展×後游擊戰爭，摧毀×僞政權，恢復我方政權，我們預祝戰動襯會未來工作的偉大勝利；　【民革社】</p>
<h3>滬市民熱烈推行　精神總動員　二百個支部卽將成立　農工商各界亦均奮起</h3>
<p>【上海通訊】十八日為國民精神總動員宜傳週之市民界宜傳日。上海市市民界國民精神總動員協會特發表宜言，對於國民精神總動員綱領意義之重要、推行之迫切、陳述甚詳、該會現正熱烈推進市民界之支部組織、預計在此宜傳週內、至少可成立支部二百個以上　、正式參加國民公約之宜誓者、當在五萬人左右、十九日爲農工商界宜傳日、該三界之國民精神總動員協會之負責人、會舉行一聯席會議、决議除發表吿農工商三界同胞、指陳當前應努力之工作外，並策動全市各界，一致熱烈縣旗十九晨全市各商店各工廠各居戶等、國旗飛揚、熱烈異常、以爲我全市民衆努力精神總動員之具體表現、茲錄市民界之宣言如次、</p>
<p>共同奮鬥　爭取自由</p>
<p>我國抗戰迄今、將及兩載，因國民政府最高領袖蔣委員長的領導措施、前綫將士的忠勇犧牲，全國民錄的團結堅固、卒龍摧方張的寇焰、令全世界為之驚異、現在抗戰巳到了第二階段、遭一階段的重要性、卽在改守勢爲攻勢、改被動爲主動、使戰爭迅速轉入總反攻的决戰、以達到收復失地建立自由平等的新中國爲目的、要達到這個目的、單靠軍隊軍器和戰略戰衛是不够的、必須實行國民精神總動員、使全國國民皆在一個統一的組織之下，有共同的信仰、抱共同的目標、爲救國建國而犧牲奮鬥、在過去、有若干人以爲中國是一弱國、無論在武器上或戰衛上、都遠不及×人拿弱國來×强國、縱使長期抗戰，也難操必勝之權、於是先存了懼×的心理、又有若干人、聽到前方勝利則大喜，聽到失了一個　名城市，則又感覺失望、而走上消極頽唐之路、更有干人、只知目前的苟安、忘却切身的危險、對於抗職聽其自然、怎樣救國、毫不在意、這幾種人、因爲在意識上沒有中心、在精神上失掉主宰、於是在表現上、遂紛亂錯雜、莫可究結、結果、一定會直接或間接影響到抗戰的前途，現在中國是到了存亡呼吸之頃，應該每一個國民、都是抗戰的戰鬥員、以四萬萬五千萬人的力量、來保衛國家、騷逐强×、然後最後勝利、棧有確切的保證、抗戰固然要依賴經濟的和武器的優越、可是經濟是要人來支配、武器也是要人來利用、只有偉大的精神、　司以左右一切、</p>
<p>抗戰建國　雙方並進</p>

<h3>曾仲鳴　被刺的經過　（三）</h3>
<p>— 羅卓明</p>
<p>第一個姚東山（譯音）廿八歲，山東人，護照由雲南發，在三月七號來河內蓮池街五十九號旅館居住。他平時很少出外，在二十號到二十一號的晚上有穿西裝騎脚踏車的華人來喊他出去。第二個叫袁伯三（譯音）廿八歲，廣西人，也是七號從海防來河內的，住在運池街的西南旅舘。他的護照是香港發的。第三個叫翁維浩（譯昔）廿九歲，安徽人、他住在同利旅舘。第四個叫盧振西（譯音）三十五歲，安徽人，三月七號從海防來河內，住在西南旅館袁伯三的隔壁房間。以上四人都巳經被捕。然而他們却沒有絲毫憂慮，讀者你看，他們反而在笑着呢！</p>
<p>他們在被捕後卽真認不諱地說會仲嗚是他們刺殺的，並且宜稱：此果是懲辦漢奸的行爲。</p>
<p>其他</p>
<p>聽說當上面的鋤奸團數人被捕之後不久，有少數的河內的靑年僑胞，會羣集中國駐河內的總領事館門前要求許總領事設法援救被捕的幾個人。所謂是非公道自在人心，於此又得一證。不知他們大言不慚地說。爲國奔走二十餘年，而深致惜之意，自吹自擂，不知究竟有什麼用處？</p>
<p>這裏法文的越南意志報（La　Volonte　Indochinoise）在最近的一天報上刊出汪精衛的照片，下面署着這樣的標題：（Wang　Cbfng　Wei,　Traitrea　SrPatie）『汪精衛·祖國的叛徒』，我們覺得這是非常恰當的說法。</p>
<p>會案發生後，下但此地僑胞的觀感大多數是『人心稱快』，卽連法國人和安南人也多表同情。聽說一般外人對於會案都有如下的觀念，即是：「被殺者是×死，殺人者乃英雄」云。</p>
<p>四月八日同上的報匕有一篇社論，題爲：「東京省不需要汪精衛』，頗有價值，目足見此地法國人對汪意見之一般，特將具大意介紹如下：</p>
<p>「背叛中國的汪精衛仍然住在河內，自從哥崙街刺法案發生以後，他的性命算僥倖保存了，他的戒　比以前也更森嚴了，汪的住宅巳經變成堡壘，門　都裝備了很厚的鋼板，又添了多名的保鏢，這還不够，警察局又加派了兩名法籍的及安南密探多人專負保獲汪精衛的責任。</p>
<p>我們認爲這種情形是非常奇怪而且再不可繼續下去的。當然，我們並不否認安南當局有保護逃來這裏的外國人的責任，而且也當維持當地的秩序，但這是需要金錢而且也要胃點危險的。說到金錢，汪精衛是會拿出來的；可是冒危險的却是法國人和安南人。（記者按：這裏所謂貿險的法人和安南人當必是指負保衛汪氏之責者而言）這一切，都無非是爲了一個中國人，（我們不××他是中國人——記者）而且是一個在行動上絲毫也得不到法國人和安南人的同情的中國人。自然，汪精衛和侵略中國的×人勾結會有他的理由，然而他因此引起了中國愛國靑年的憤怒和搜殺，他爲了一條可憐的性命逃到安南來，這一切都是他自己的事，並非我們的過錯，我們又何必耗費有用的金錢和叫我們法國人或安南人去爲他冒生命的危險呢！</p>
<p>我們以爲這是他和中國人的寥情。假如他需要幣助，頂好是去請他的日本朋友幹這個×費錢又危險的麻煩事體。我們安南對汪精衛總算巳經盡了地主之誼了，現在他應當滾蛋去！……</p>
<p>××的汪精衛應該馬上離開這裏！假如他還是戀戀不捨，則政府應該驅逐他』！</p>
<p>像上列的論調在該報還一再出現，本月十四號又有一篇主張逐汪的評論。汪精衛你逃到那去去！　（完）</p>
<p>四月十四日於河內</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>粵東閩海吃緊</h3>
<p>日來各綫我軍反攻進展，使×遭遇重大打擊，國際輿論界對此亦巳加以重大的注視。不過在此反攻節節勝利之際，我人又看到了關於粵東潮汕一帶和閩海形勢緊張的消息，這又是爲了什麼？前途趨勢如何？我們要怎樣應付？</p>
<p>我們已經知道，目前×人的軍事計劃，主要着眼在貫通平漢粵漢兩路，完成及鞏固東路以東的佔領，以軍事與反共和平建立僞中央政權等政治陰謀相配合，準備新的大規模的進攻。爲了完成這個計劃，則×軍對長沙對福州對潮汕的窺伺，便不是奇怪的事了。不過因爲日來我們反攻廣州的軍事大有進展，×人更覺有立卽發動東側戰事以謀解救的必要。便立刻發動對我潮汕以至閩海一帶的威脅了。</p>
<p>潮汕抗戰準備快有兩年了，閩省則除早有相當戰備以外，尙有地形上的優勢，這是我們足以阻止×人任何威脅與進攻的現存的保證。特別是以我各地民氣的激昂，游擊活動的相當發展，使我們敢於斷言×人從使實行冒險，必將遭遇嚴重的阻力。</p>
<p>不過我們並未充分具備制止×人向粵閩進攻的壓倒的力量，特別是我們在政治上尤其是民眾運動俘在若干嚴重的缺陷和弱點。因此我們今日還必須要求閩粵當局遵照中央政府國策與最高領袖迭次訓論，在堅持團結堅持抗戰的最高原則下，加緊政治上的進步，特別是加緊鞏固各黨派各階層各團體的統一戰線，加緊實施戰時民主政治與改善各級行政機構，加緊推行國民精神總動員運動，並予人民以參加抗戰的民主自由，儘可能讓民衆組織起來武裝起來，擴大游擊戰備保衛家鄉的運動。同時還要加緊展開肅奸反汪的運動，澈底掃除『反共』『和平』等降×賣國的言論行動。只有廣大民衆積極起來協助政府和軍隊的力量，才是阻××人進攻的最大的保證！</p>
<p>華僑的故鄉，閩粵西北的戰事將在×人的新攻略之下更廣大更慘酷地展開了！我們各地僑胞，更應該加緊動員少壯份子和技衛專家返國回鄉服務！更應該加緊捐輸××將士救濟難民的工作！</p>

<h3>我們的路在那裏？　薪水階級的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>從商務印書館職工要求改善待遇說起</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>薪水階級在生產方面既不是「剩餘價值」的榨取者，在消費方面又不能像勞動階級那麼簡單。他們又不會麻木與盲目。因此，「悲哀」跟「薪水階級」結了不解之緣，不是始於今日，亦不只是限於香港一隅。但是，香港於今尤烈確是千眞萬確的事實。</p>
<p>戰事發生之後，香港生活程度的增漲最明顯的莫如房租了。以中環和灣仔一帶而論，房租增加百分之二，五，水費　須目理。三房客因項再受二房東剝削，較戰前至少增加百分之五十。新遷入者，所均更幾　一倍，其他九龍半島一帶八元或十元增加至二十二元；新造房之每層達百元者亦比比皆是。再看生活上的必需品吧：</p>
<p>戰前　現在</p>
<p>柴：一元百廿斤……一元約六十斤</p>
<p>米：一元念一斤……一元十二斤</p>
<p>油：一毛半一斤……二毛二仙一斤</p>
<p>猪肉：二毛五仙一斤……五毛左右一斤</p>
<p>牛肉：一元可五六磅……一元不足三磅</p>
<p>蔬菜：一毛三斤……一毛不足一斤</p>
<p>其他：……都是漲價</p>
<p>消費是這樣繁重，而收入的薪水却又依然故我，甚或　少，這是薪水階級一個切身的大威脅。至於那些跟着職業來到香港者，箇中苦况，更像啞子吃黃蓮一般難受。</p>
<p>他們有的是領着打了折扣的務水；有的是領着國幣而用着港幣；有的雖然還是領若港幣，而消費却比國內更高。收入既然是說减，而消費却相反地突增。除住與吃已如上述外，在國內不成問題的「穿衣」問題，在香港亦大大成了問題。你自以爲「新生活」，「樸實」，「美德」隨處却要受到人家的奚落與鄙視。爲了工作上的便利，却不得不跟着人家虛僞地梢爲撑撑門面。至於意外的打擊，不能計劃，無法節制的，尤其使人頭痛。地土氣候不慣，病魔就纏上身來。要是一個三口之家或是五口之家的家長，他的白髪一定添加幾根，他額上的皺紋，一定加深衰老的痕跡。</p>
<p>香港是一個交通的樞紐，大家同是天涯淪落者，濟親朋之急，以及送往迎來不能避免的應酬，又在在義不容辭。生活的重祖緊緊地壓住全身；生活的鐡鞭不客氣地鞭笞着。在香港，將如何生活下去呢？</p>
<p>據記者所知，新近向當局誠意要求改善待遇的就有商務書館的職工同人。查商務書館自八一三以來，營業數量僅及戰前之六成，以百分之六十的營業而維持百分之白的開銷，當局的處境自然是很困難的，不得已而酌减薪水實在亦非其甘願。緊縮的辦法就是三十元以下者不折不扣，三十元以上六十元以下者支九折，六十元以上，一百元以下者，支八折，一百元以上者支七折，……如此遞减。上海總館如此，重慶及香港分館亦如此。最近因爲滬渝兩地生　程度突高，商務書舘當局體諒職工的苦衷，經已在困難中設法一律增加一成，亦算是暫舒芸芸職工的燃眉之迫。香港方面，四十元以下的小部份職員已得到優待，一百元以上的高級職員亦增加二成。至於一部份未得優待的職員現正要求當局一視同仁，改善待遇。該館總經理王雲五先生精明能幹，經己俯允候設法改善。</p>
<p>記者例舉商務書館之困難以及職工要求改善待遇之迫切者，爲的是說明：商務書館尙且如此，其他各行的處境，更不言而喻了。至於那些廣大的失業羣衆，其苦楚又不知要增加多少倍。我們絕不怨尤戰爭，我們要澈底認淸這一切的苦楚，都是日本軍閥賜給我們的。</p>
<p>改善生活，勞資協調固是當前之急。澈底的，眞正的出路在那裏？抗戰勝利，民族解放就是我們的路。</p>

<h3>進行中的粵省救濟工作</h3>
<p>— 微波</p>
<p>蔣委員長說：「現代戰爭爲國與國間人力物力財力總和之决賽，其經濟物質能爲持久之供給，卽得最後之勝利」。我們讀到以上的名言，當知賬救工作在目前是如何的重要！</p>
<p>戰時救濟事業、是積極的、不是消極的、是生產的、不是銷費的、要努力救濟工作，不僅是爲着人溺己溺的慈　心腸去帮忙同胞的意思、而是、站在民族立場說、維持我們人力物力財力持久之供給的泉源、促成最後勝利能得早實現、</p>
<p>在廣東、負起這個魚大使命的是廣東省振濟會、省振會的前身、是難民救濟委員會、於本年二月一日遵照行政院命令改組成立、並秉依李主席的救濟事業綱要、按步推行，</p>
<p>經過短短的兩個月時間、有救濟會已經做了不少的工作、如編組救濟總隊、深入戰區工作、分遺專員調查各處難民、分發棉背心與各縣會散賑雞民、撥給賑欵與各縣會辦理振濟、調查各縣難童。舉辦難童教育團設、置難民墾殖區、舉辦種籽耕牛農具各項貸欵、</p>

<h3>東北片商血淚語</h3>
<p>— 人辛</p>
<p>鐵蹄下之偽「滿」影業近狀</p>
<p>東北西省淪陷、傀儡登場、變爲僞「滿洲國」以來、民衆們在被壓迫下、度着很慘苦的非人生活、所有—切事業、都被統制、尤其是屬於文化部門的電影事業、加緊壓迫、剝奪利益、不遺餘力、直把他們當作牛馬看待、最近、有位旅滬片商、談起那裏一番　情、眞是血淚俱下、這裏、謹作一簡略記述、以見暗無天日的東北電影業的眞實情形、</p>
<p>電影檢查偽「滿」</p>
<p>電影檢查在日籍顧問統率之下、起先是很凌亂的概由各省區隨地檢查、各自爲政、因此好惡從心、漫無標的、有時甲地映過的片子、常在乙地遭禁、丙地被剪得體無完膚的、在丁地却又原封不動的映出、這樣莫明其妙的檢查事件、電影商常被弄得走投無路、痛苦難言、一九三四年七月間、頒布了所謂「東方電影檢查統一方針」、改歸僞「民政部警務司」實飾辦理、從那時起始、電影檢查、才算歸於「統一」、</p>
<p>奴化影片日本影片在僞「滿」開映、也須經過審查、不過這僅是形式上的手續而己、實際上日本可以公映的影片在偽滿是决不會受到任何留難的、而它們有一部份戴着「東亞和平」面具的奴化影片、且常獲得、「民政部一的褒獎、但有些日本影片，無非映給他們自己欣賞而已、</p>
<p>剝削慘況不久以前、又成立了一個所謂「電影管理局」、管理僞「滿」境內一切電影行政、和其他機關一樣、表面上由偽「官」主持、實際大權則操於日籟顧問的掌握、「管理局」對於電影實施嚴格統制、輸入各片概須交與掌管、營業也須由它們去支配、所有全部營業收入、「管理局」概與片主四六分拆——「管理局」取四成，片主得六成。這樣剥削手段、更是橫暴得無可理喻、國產影片東北映權售價，連得一切費用在內、每片約須四千元左右、所　每片營業收入必須超過七千元才能歸本、片商的利益、　被搶去、無異在給他們充當牛馬、</p>
<p>國片近狀至於在僞「滿」開映的國產片，大都是些幾年前的純娛樂性的舊片。凡是稍有一點民族意識與時代思想的國片，絕對不在那裏出映。僞「滿」當局對於此類影片禁制固然嚴極，片商們也不敢輕於冒險，幹這種有殺身之禍的買賣。</p>
<p>最後，據他見吿，對于這種牛馬生活。自已早就放　不幹了，以前也須是為生活關係，迫于無奈，但在自巳良心上，總不免赧然。受着無形的譴責，覺得非常不安，總之，這揮黑暗圈子裏的非人生活，非身歷其境的人們，是不知道那樣慘苦的。</p>

<p>過了好幾個月、天氣很冷、哈立范帶着六個女孩子，離開了奧末黑、到瑞士去表演、他們在火車上、經過了好幾個歐洲國家、到了蒙泰羅達、車子忽然停了、有人高呼乘客都下車來、車子不再向前開了、哈立的一羣也只得下車、看見有一輛寫若蒙泰羅達飯店的接客汽車、他趕過去、向ｇ　個美國靑年招待詢問、到底發生了什麼事、那個叫做唐納南維台的靑年、吿訴他、附近立刻就會有戰事發生、火車不能前進了、最好的辨法、他們還是到蒙泰羅達飯店先生住下、再想法子、</p>
<p>蒙泰羅達飯店在山上，可以望見飛機場、唐納指給一些旅容看、能看見巨大的飛機于在飛出去、這時下面的路上、駛來了一輛華軍的汽車、唐　立刻說、『看這車子的外長、可知來的一定是個、人、對不起諸位、我應該到出門口去等候了、』</p>

<h3>足球聯賽壓軸戯　南南海軍爭錦標　今日下午四時三刻戰於海軍塲　米杜息與五營炮兵作乙組亞軍決賽於掃桿埔塲</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）去星期六日因雨展期的甲組足球聯賽爭標戰、如天公肯帮忙，不致一誤再誤、則這幕够刺激性的好戲、今天下午四時三刻便在銅鑼灣畔的海軍場排演了、</p>
<p>還有一幕、是乙組聯賽亞軍爭奪戰、亦定今天下午四時半在掃桿埔場舉行、</p>
<p>南華南和海軍這對　場寃家、自轉入第二循環賽後、因彼此績分極為接近及互有起跌的原故、遂使錦標趨勢、跟着比賽的變化多端中、弄成一個謎局、卒至乃有此回爭標遭遇戰、</p>
<p>到了最後關頭、嚴重可知、故在去星明六日我曾這樣說過、「南南非勝不可、如其得勝、則有三點意義、第一點乃得聯賽冠軍、取乃第（南華華）去屆的光榮地位而代之、尙未許別人問鼎、第二點如這囘可以克海軍、則他日旭和　第三戰、亦可穩澡左券、因是之故、此役不啻爭奪旭和杯的試金石、而包辦六大錦標的形勢、亦因比次勝利愈趨穩定、第三點南南在日前受阨於警察的時候、適値東方亦挫海軍、南南遂得仍居於超然地位、但別要志記東方間接的帮忙、應該投　報李、助其成功、故最好趁着這次機會、殺退海軍、如其這樣、旣可爭得一己的光榮、亦可替東方謀一出路、為的是海軍如敗、則續分恰與東方相同、便須多來一次亞軍决賽、那宋、東方或亦會戰勝海軍、一躍而登次席」</p>
<p>雙方成敗得失、在此一舉、遭遇之下、必作殊死戰、然南南多獲一分、地位較佳、卽使不勝而祗戰成和局、亦得　軍、惟東方須望海軍必敗、乃有爭奪亞軍的機會、故因人成事、未免自私、而其希望南南必勝之心、亦至為　切、</p>
<p>兵艦來去靡定、海軍球人乃時有不同、這次爭標戰因延遲一週而舉行、頗有利於海軍、為的是前天又有一兵艦到港、載來不少健將、所以今天出戰人馬、與去星期六日排定的有多少變更、尤堪注意的、乃係右內鋒一職、復見鍾士担任、這傢伙功夫項好、在去年旭和杯第一戰時、我曾見過他的表演、的是不凡，擅射、　衝、又擅盤、寄語南南守將、千萬提防、不過洋球員向名的特多，未悉這位鍾士、是否即其人、如其眞的、實足為患，切莫等閒視他、</p>
<p>去星期六日的軍帖中、乃定摩利士打中鋒、今天則調他為左翼、另換上一位名兒陌生的金卑路、担任中鋒之職、依此推測、金卑路的本領定然高强、否則不會　樣調動的、原定任左翼的高路士、則退守左前衛、顯見的他又是個攻守咸宜的健將、</p>
<p>門將也不是　濱孫，而是的架臣、聽說他的技衛、不在麥加利士打之下、總之、海軍這個陣線、比去星期六所定的必史完整而無疑、望南南諸將，打醒精神、圖取最後勝利，</p>
<p>南南的麥紹漢、足部傷處發炎、致未能効力於此重要比賽、影響實大、差幸前鋒綫得葉北華重登戰場、乃可調郭英祺退守前衛、編排陣綫、尙稱得體、</p>
<p>北華是南華復興的功臣、與馮景祥極合作、雖上了年紀、動作慢些、然够經驗、總比用李恩良勝得多、惟有一點、北華、景祥及黎兆榮、都有同樣作風、故恐怕太過側重三角式短傳進攻法，反為累事、最好遠交近攻、見機而行、切莫「獨沽一味」、祇從中路短傳而進展、兩翼方面、宜多利用、若能够四面夾攻、才是上策、</p>
<p>海軍人强馬壯、野心勃勃、故料不定勝利誰屬、南南欲不致功虧一簣、總要努力、則大好錦標，自會到手的了、兩陣如下、（太歲）</p>

<h3>怎樣練習捷泳</h3>
<p>— 潘叢紹</p>
<p>關于捷泳練習、在此分作學習和訓練兩部份來講、前者的話冀使學習獲有迅捷正確的門徑、要想捷泳技術效用、那又不能不講求訓練之道了、</p>
<p>泳式不只一種、上回經已列述過了、初學的究應從那種入手、這倒是一般學習者未能循其正軌的問題、我們從事游泳，旣能獲取一種護身之技、又可增進健康、還會從中感到身心上極大的愉快、要想這幾項目標兼　到達、條件很多、實以先習捷泳為要、因為它的動作最驕捷、所以用處最大、但其學習的辛苦不易克服、學者每多棄而他顧、表露出怕勞食安的弱點、更談不上以游泳為增强體魄的方法了、</p>
<p>捷泳的動作是這樣的、肢髒成一字形、下肢相繼不斷上下打動、上肢亦更迭不竭地從首前插入水中，向後推去、這樣的動作、就能發生浮體和推進的作用、至于呼吸、這得配合捷泳的動作、才能做到、在陸上學習游泳，似乎是個笑話、其實却很需要、不但能够把習泳的觔作多得熱習的機會、尤易改正犯錯誤的動作、連要求泳技續進的也不能忽略此舉、</p>
<p>沈進水裏去，首先要學的是浮體動作、別畏水、更不必害怕水花衝激　眼、把四肢分向前後合直伸起來頭和肢體就如一字的樣子、任它飄浮水中、發生身體能够浮在水中的自信、（一）</p>

<h3>追隨總理</h3>
<p>— 季子</p>
<p>巴金的某一本小說裏面，曾描寫過一個市儈，混跡革命隊伍中，動不動就拿「總理拍過我盼肩溥一一說話，向別人眩耀，似乎榮幸到了極點，他的心目中，總以為自己早就贊助革命，早就是總理的忠實信徒，而今最起碼也是個革命元勳了。這小說上的典型人物，在今日抗戰的大時代中，居然遍地都存在着，小自土豪劣紳惡霸地痞，大至發國難財的善棍，當漢奸的叛國要人，無所不有，他們所犯的錯誤，比之「總理拍過肩膊」的市儈仁兄，眞是有過之無不及，在假面其快要被拉下來的時候，他們都喜歡拿追隨總理歷數十年」一派說話來掩飾自已，傘革命做幌子，拿總理做千人針，擋箭牌，在有利的場合裏他們還會進一步，利用法律去消滅攻訐他們的人們，過去不是有人在廣州控吿過越華報，要求賠償名譽，封閉報館嗎？後來廣州淪陷，他當眞做了漢奸，大家才嘆息偽善者扮演得像煞有介事，其實，在打官司期中，是非不白之際，他何嘗不以追總理一為護身符呢？胆怯的偽善者，他們都慣於運用「以攻為守」的策略，在眞相暴露前一分鐘，他們還是拿大大總理去抑壓別人，扶長自己，等到一切都决定了，於是，他們才露出尾巴來，無恥的追隨「皇軍」去了。事實上，總理奔走革命多年，認識的人當然不少，果然努力革命，贊助追隨的人未常沒有，不過總理偶然在某人的家裏吃過一頓飯，在某人家裏寄宿一夜，我們不能說某人便算追隨了，便算革命元動了，何况革命過程，還有不少中途落伍，叛變份子呢？「紅軍十三勇士」裏面一個乓，起初他何嘗不追隨紅軍隊長，糾纏敵人，努力殺敵？最後，他熬不住革命過程中的痛苦，終於叛變了——奔投入敵人的懷裏，結果給忠勇持久的同伴忍痛解决了。這雖是一個宣揚革命史蹟的電影楊面，但也可以用來答覆「追隨總理」一語的錯誤。</p>
<p>俄國大革命時代，高爾基的名字，國內婦孺皆知，當時常常有人利用社會敬重高爾基的心理，去為非作惡，譬如一個小竊被補的時候，他會這樣懇求，「看在高爾基的面上，饒我一次吧！」今日，拿「追隨總理」做幌子的人們，無論手段怎樣高明，實際仍不免採用小竊同樣作風。</p>
<p>其實，動亂的時代裏，究竟有幾個眞是忠實的革命同志，有幾個會「追隨」數十年，總理本人也無法記得淸楚，何况今日總理不在人間，而偽造膺品又多着呢？我想：這些自以為忠實同志的人們，以後可不必再拿同樣的東西做盾牌了，須知你也借用，我也借用，幌子的價値就會减低，終有一天，這幌子變了一九一八的德國馬克了。</p>
<p>在抗戰的旗幟下，過去的帳都不要算了，不管你做過傀儡也好，當過偽軍也好，只要今天反正過來，追隨「抗戰」，便會名垂千古，造福子孫不少；反過來說，卽使你過去當什麼個總裁，行刺過什麽滿淸親王，追過總理若干年，寫過總理遺囑，你一旦無恥的投到敵人的懷抱裏，那你光輝萬丈的歷史；眼見就會消失得無影無踪。</p>
<h3>抗粮</h3>
<p>— 階陽</p>
<p>整個的鎭，龍罩在陰沉沉的大空中，砭骨的寒風，巡哨着長廊般的市街，格外顯得凄凉蕭條。</p>
<p>市河中，盪起不平凡的波動，東港西港，成羣的船兒，載來了近百個年靑的一羣，從那項闊邊氈帽上。可以知道他們盡是以「吃鬥」聞名的澄湖邊的好漢。</p>
<p>一個精壯的靑年，首先跳上了岸，擎起了他手中的鐵鋤，向站在船上的一羣高聲喊道：「傢伙隨手帶好，今天該顯顯我們吃鬥不吃鬥，知道嗎？」他隨手一揚，船上的一羣，都一湧而上了岸。</p>
<p>他們握着鋤頭，扁祖，鐵尺……像潮水那樣直往鎭的西梢，湧到了「區公所」的門前，那個精壯的靑年擎起那塊放在門首的「田賦征收處」的木牌］猛地向那個站在門邊的偽警擊去，「賊你娘，今天來跟你們完糧！」</p>
<p>他們直向裏爾，穿上了樓。只有一個妙稱惡訟師的錢會計在那裏，他們亦不打話，一窠蜂地拳打脚踢他一陣，又把他打窗口裏擲下了樓去。</p>
<p>雜沓的搗毀聲中，揚起一陣擊聲，一到「獨誤主任」家裏去—去…到…去…」</p>
<p>他們像潮水般又到湧了轉角那家染坊裏，那裏是「分會長一兼「征務主任」的馬獨眼的家。</p>
<p>可是他們找徧了屋子，不見獨眼龍那厮。</p>
<p>「好，漢奸的傢具，我們也該把它燒燬了才爽快，」那個精壯的靑年，提着兩把椅子，「搬，大家搬！搬到廟場那邊去燒！」</p>
<p>近百個人一齊動手，一下子把屋裏的東西搬得精空，廟場上堆成山樣的什麽都有，桌子也有，凳子也有，衣服也有連那染缸裏浸着的布匹也都撈了起來堆在裏面。</p>
<p>民衆們把廟場擠得水洩不通，他們鼓掌歡呼，當那紅紅的烈焰怒吼着的時候。</p>
<p>死去也似的鎮上，也就充溢了熱烘烘的活氣。</p>
<h3>虛偽</h3>
<p>— 潤圭</p>
<p>這是個謎，讓他在腦中蕩着吧！</p>
<p>在得不到究竟該回答些什麽時，我這末安慰着自己：人類的虛偽是從最遠的先祖遺傳下來的，不該有作用，企圖，所以有這種情形者，全是人類太會運用本性，於是我就輕視人類，當然也輕視自己！</p>
<p>在童年的時候，偶然也會發覺親戚的欺詐虛偽，不過因當時無所知，祗當這是長輩的天經地義，或處世態度，所以根本不介意，轉了個背，已讓心思用到踢小皮球，打彈子上面去了，入了學生時代，這種情形看的多了，如同學的抄挾帶被敎員捉到了，他們必硬說沒有作過弊，在女生面前特別喜歡誇耀，吹牛，雖然他自己也明知對方對自己的話，祗當耳旁吹過一陣風，以後到了社會，各色各樣觸目驚心的欺騙事情，看的更透了，可是我的心部也更感到惶惑，茫然，同時也更輕蔑人類。</p>
<p>人類的虛偽，總是千方百計的：有的利用了虛偽，想騙得些好處，有的為了某件事物，就不得不虛偽一下，好像若缺少了虛偽，在社會上立足就祗有獨隻脚似的，沒有憑籍，站得不穩，盡管你的才學好，本領高，只好飄在虛無漂渺中，一個不小心，在地上，弄的滿體傷痕。相反地，若能靈活地虛偽起來，至少你不會做個餓壞了肚子哭喪着臉，喊着哀求於人「做做好事吧！」的窮措大。一言以蔽之：虛偽就是敎你怎樣處世，怎樣活命。</p>
<p>這樣的意思，說來好像近乎唯虛偽主義的崇拜者了。但是我雖不是如此主張，而有些事實放在眼前，却不能不令人有此感，你看，現在社會上誰要活命，誰要顯貨，誰就不得不虛偽，誰就不得不歪曲地來利用虛偽。於是誰也祗有永還給人唾駡輕視的份兒！虛偽之成虛偽，這樣說來，該不是偶然的了。</p>
<h3>文化商人與文化人</h3>
<p>— 赤槐</p>
<p>遺是一個資本主義的社會，這社會的特徵，就是一切物的商品化，文化人的姿態，那怕文化自已的意志是怎樣，依舊逃不過以商品化的姿態出現。現在從事文化的人雖然是一種苦難，却是歷史的定命的事業，非個人的力量所能擺脫。</p>
<p>可是照資本主義的「公平」交易的原則言，一個商品的賣方與買方，是各自站在「平等」的地位的，各自照着所謂「自由意志」進行交易，賣貨的可以討價，買貨的可以還價，那怕這是偽自由的形式。</p>
<p>但獨有文化人和文化商人間的「賣買」是例外，除少數有名文人的作品有定價外（而且這與其說是賣方自定，母寗說是買方鑒於賣方的聲名而定的），很少見一個文人將其產品標價出售。這原因因為文人只注意其作品，而不大注意其作品所應得的代價。他不能像別的商品般估計其品的「生產費用」——成本。他把稿子交給也版界或其他發行人而由買方偏面算定所謂一千字多少錢的稿費。對於一個文人，斤斤於多少錢是認為一種羞恥的，這種觀念，已經成為歷來巳久的一般文人心理。</p>
<p>文化人的工作目的，主要在推進社會的向上，所以不以金錢為目標。就文化人的優點言，他除了獲得一部分為生活所必需的金錢外，他更獲得一定程度的社會地位。可是在現社會的情形下，這一定程度的地位，却往往犧牲了他們的最低限度的必需生活，我們因此看到了一般丈人的蒼白而瘦削的臉，一副窮書生的寒酸相。關於一般文人的悲慘生活，已有許多死於窮困的文人佐證，這里不想多說。</p>
<p>若果一般文人的悲慘生活，其代價確是全部供獻於社會的進步，那麽我敢代表每一個文人說，他們是甘心的，但事實却舍訴我們不然，從事文化的人像別的許多勞動者一樣，受着一小羣人的刺削和榨取，這羣人就是文化商人，他們利用文人羞於論爭金錢酬報的弱點，以超乎榨取尋常勞動者的手段，榨取文化勞動者，這在抗戰以前是事實，而在抗戰中的今日，尤其是鐵一樣的事實。</p>
<p>讀者諸君也許有不少人美慕文人的生活，但諸君心目中想像的只是少許特異地位文人的生活，或美國式野人頭傳說中的文人生活。至於一般文人的生活現狀，只有過着這樣實際生活的人們，才能領略箇中味道。箇中雖决非桃花源，但却一樣的不能為外人道。</p>
<p>我們且不談今日文化人勞作的報酬，這是無從談起的。我們又要問他們的工作有沒有報酬。是的，我不敢說全沒有報酬。但文人要取得他工作應得報酬之前，却先須學得市儈式的面目。有這種本領的文人，不能說全然沒有，但却絕對少數。</p>
<p>於是乎寄生於文化人勞動的文化商人，始終得以在妓院裏，在跳舞廳喜過其荒淫的生活，反正有許多文化工作者的失業後備軍，他們正不必怕文人會死完。</p>
<p>我們為避免漢奸和托派的挑撥，所以不願具體指出今日文化商人怎樣剝削文人的事業，我們遵守國家勞資合作的法令，不願造成敵人離間口實的糾紛，我們更不想在此整個國家在艱難時覜中要求提高文化人的生活標準——雖然我們擁護改善一般人民生活的水準，但我們要求有最低限度的生活，我們認為文化工作是協助抗戰勝利的一枝有力的隊伍，我們不能聽遁文化商人無限制的剝削！不付稿費，呑沒版稅，倫印原作者遠在內地的作品等等。這是等於盜匪的行為！至少應予以道德的制裁。</p>
<h3>硯（續）</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>關于瘋子，我巳略有所聞，豈但世交，而且還是小時同學，不過因為見面的機會很少，彼此就逐漸疎遠了，我們有多少幼年時代的同學，都這樣弄到互不相識的。聽說他飽經憂患，神經受了影響，心上想的，嘴裏就要說出來，人家背地裏都叫他瘋子。這一囘烽火之中，更受了劇烈的刺激，愈變得哭笑無常了。孩子們全愛逗他，叫他唱打鬼子歌。沒有唱完，眼淚直拋，唱完了，又哈哈大笑。這是傷心透了頂的人，所以呌瘋子。</p>
<p>他並不要我囘答，自動說下去，把鼻子凑近硯台聞了聞：</p>
<p>「這硯台上留着洗不淸的血腥，也是為我們黃帝子孫留一線正氣，好大小姐，你眞是我的女兒，你會不長强，你會不怕死，你會見危授命，你會不辱淸白之身，你會抓起這硯台，擊破了賊人的腦袋！好大小姐。我們的歷祖歷宗，英靈不遠，都附在這硯台上，帮你殺賊！可惜這一擊還不够重，沒有擊死那畜生，反吃他拔出槍來，呀呀！你終究吃虧了！可恨的事眞多着呢！我做了你的爸，不能保護你，不曾預先將你藏掉，我不曾帶你逃難，他們全用大船把家私載到鄉下去，我不曾想到眞有這一着！我狗也不如，給他們牽了來，拉了去，掃馬糞扛木板，還遭他們的駡！我不會把木板打破他們的頭，我沒有這種胆，我還想活，我還想囘來，和你一同避到鄉下去。等到我囘來，港奶奶告訴你的故事，啊呀，這硯台上還留着血腥！」</p>
<p>這那裏是人的說話，這簡直是一隻甚麽受傷的猛獸在吼在悲嗚，他陰森的眼光，像利刃一般穿破了我的心，我沒有話好說。</p>
<p>「現在，仗不打了，縣知事也有了，舖子開了，大家又嘻嘻哈哈地過日子了，哼，有得你們快活，我恨不得拿起硯台，擊破了你們一個個的頭！哼：哼……手抓金牌將門闖——</p>
<p>他舉起硯台，站起身，在空中舞動着，邁開大步，一路舞了出去。我看着他的背影，心頭酸酸地，這背影現在是這樣的瘦弱，想起小時同堂讀書，做遊戲，擲皮球，他老是那麽的剛强，大公雞似的多麽威武，誰知給時間磨練成這個樣子！</p>
<p>孩子拉拉我的手，說：</p>
<p>「爸，你亦瘋了嗎？」</p>
<p>我點點頭，說：</p>
<p>「噯，我要着瘋了！」</p>
<p>（完）</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>「我找不到你的地方呀！你不知道家人都在找你那個地方嗎？」</p>
<p>她祗聽見聲昔，看不見人。正在她探望的時候，突然望見一隻黑熊。她被驚得在哭聲中流不出淚水來，慌張着，退走着。但那黑熊並不傷害她，而且吿訴她說：</p>
<p>「你到我的穴洞來吧」！</p>
<p>「我不去。」</p>
<p>那不是黑熊而是廣鬼了，强迫她去。她拒絕着，打着那魔鬼。這時候，她突然醒覺了。她呆呆地望着目己的身邊，不是雪野，而是雪色的被褥。她摸一摸自己的臉頰胸脯，被自己的拳頭打得還痛。她跳下床來，向身外尋覓着什麽；屋內的一切，她都不需要，需要的，是一扇自由出入的門。甚至一個自由爬行的小穴，讓她走到自由的地方去。她終於失望了，又哭了。</p>
<p>結果，她仍是在這誘人惡夢的房間，過度着陌生的初夜。</p>
<p>窗外的雪，沙粒一樣地打着玻璃發響，不停地響着。這很像在海上的小島、聽着從沙灘湧來湧去的海潮遺下的騷着，不停地擾着聽者的安靜。是的，滿洲的雲，是擾人睡眠的。　（四四）</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of Overseas Chinese Opinion Leaders to the Motherland</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, the need for newspapers and periodicals among overseas Chinese has become increasingly urgent, and the newspaper industry in various places has also flourished. This is especially true in Hong Kong, which is close to the motherland. As a result, the status of overseas Chinese opinion leaders in the motherland, in overseas Chinese communities, and internationally has gradually increased.</p>
<p>For more than twenty months, except for a very few newspapers privately run by Chinese traitors, the majority of overseas Chinese opinion leaders have been able to prioritize the interests of the nation and the people, move in unison, support the central government's national policy of adhering to unity and resisting aggression to the end, and call on overseas Chinese of all walks of life to wholeheartedly participate in all undertakings related to the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. This is not only the glory of the overseas Chinese opinion circles, but also the glory of the Chinese opinion circles internationally.</p>
<p>However, there is no need to shy away from the fact that our motherland's War of Resistance against Japan for survival and liberation is still transitioning to a new and more difficult stage, which is also the stage that determines the life and death of our nation and people. In this stage, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek recently told us that "the hardship required of the national people to strive for recovery is becoming increasingly greater than in the previous period. The enemy now knows that military power alone is not enough to subdue us and achieve its goals. Therefore, its recent plan is to shake our will and threaten our spirit by various means." Therefore, we must implement the General Mobilization Outline for National Spirit, and enhance the self-esteem and self-confidence of the entire nation, in order to completely crush the enemy's strategy. Our overseas Chinese opinion leaders should first recognize their important position in the current stage, and resolutely take on the responsibility of promoting the General Mobilization for National Spirit. We believe that the General Mobilization for National Spirit is the most important current event that determines the life and death of the nation and people, and that promoting the General Mobilization for National Spirit is the only central task of opinion leaders, especially overseas Chinese opinion leaders.</p>
<p>After recognizing this important central task, we should also recognize that our General Mobilization for National Spirit is actually a political mobilization of the entire nation, and the first step is a broad ideological mobilization. To overcome all the difficulties in the current stage of the War of Resistance, to defeat all the enemy's conspiracies, to adhere to unity and resistance, and to strive for the final victory, we must first further enhance the nation's self-esteem and strengthen the people's confidence in the final victory. As the General Mobilization Outline for National Spirit says, "What we should focus on today is to pay attention to the revitalization and concentration of the spirit." Therefore, the first responsibility that our overseas Chinese opinion should fulfill to the motherland is to strike at all traitorous ideas and speeches that betray the nation and the people, undermine military victory, shake the will, and disperse strength, such as "anti-communism," "peace," and "mediation," according to the three major principles of "nation first, people first, military affairs first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength," and to overcome all pessimistic and disappointed emotions, and to promote the revolutionary spirit of the Three People's Principles. This is one.</p>
<p>Our current central task of the General Mobilization for National Spirit is aimed at the enemy's and the traitors' political offensive conspiracy, so the enemy and the traitors will inevitably use all kinds of tricks to sabotage it, mainly by using the excuse of correcting divergent and complicated ideas to provoke feelings among various parties, strata, and even groups within the national united front, causing mutual suspicion, infighting, annexation, and other situations that violate the needs of resistance and national reconstruction. Therefore, our opinion leaders, especially those who are in a special environment where the enemy and the traitors are rampant, have their first responsibility to the motherland, which is to point out that the so-called nation first and people first are precisely aimed at the enemy's conspiracy and used to oppose the conspiracy of splitting the nation and the people and destroying the united front; the so-called correcting divergent and complicated ideas refers to the traitorous ideas of "anti-communism" and "peace"; furthermore, it should be pointed out that under the premise of not violating the revolutionary spirit of the Three People's Principles and not destroying the united front and not hindering the War of Resistance, the existence and development of various parties and groups should also be guaranteed and promoted, so that each can contribute its best efforts to the cause of resistance and national reconstruction, and various opinions and theories should be encouraged to discuss and learn from each other to gather ideas and benefit. This is two.</p>
<p>Of course, our current central task of the General Mobilization for National Spirit is by no means a purely idealistic movement, but a practical work of broad mobilization of the power of the entire nation. We must use the General Mobilization for National Spirit to mobilize the vast national power, and then carry out the necessary organization and training in order to highly exert this power and give the enemy and the traitors a thorough and fatal blow. As the "Outline" says, "We must use organized spirit to exert organized manpower and use organized materials in order to meet the current needs of the country." Therefore, our opinion leaders, especially overseas Chinese opinion leaders, have a third responsibility to the motherland, which is to establish or enrich the organization of all mobilization work, strive for a large amount of democracy and freedom, so that they can fully exert their autonomy and initiative, and lead and assist all sectors, groups, institutions, schools, factories, and businesses, to implement the National Covenant oath and the National Monthly Meeting, use the method of mutual competition and mutual inspection, and assist the central government in leading the overseas Chinese community to effectively carry out the General Mobilization for National Spirit movement, in accordance with the General Mobilization for National Spirit outline and adapt to the special environment of each place. This is three.</p>
<p>In addition, and most importantly, the overseas Chinese opinion leaders, all employees of the newspaper industry, should first carry out the National Covenant oath and hold the National Monthly Meeting on a large scale, as a model for overseas Chinese of all walks of life. The overseas Chinese opinion leaders in some places have unified organizations, such as the Newspaper Reporters Association and the Young Reporters Association in Hong Kong. When Wang Jingwei issued a statement in response to the Konoe Declaration advocating anti-communism, the former telegraphed the central government requesting severe punishment, which added glory to the overseas Chinese opinion circles, while the latter made great efforts for various national salvation movements. Recently, they launched a reporter's signature campaign in response to the General Mobilization for National Spirit, which should be supported by all patriotic overseas Chinese with ambition and conscience. Now that the supreme leader has once again confirmed that Wang Jingwei's words and deeds are subjugating the country, it is even clearer that anti-Wang is one of the practical tasks of the General Mobilization for National Spirit. It is hoped that the opinion leaders will be able to carry forward the past glory, exert greater efforts, eliminate traitors and scum, and take on the current central task, which is first of all the task of anti-Wang and anti-traitors, enhance the status of the opinion circles, enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence, and realize the General Mobilization for National Spirit. We must know that only with the efforts of the overseas Chinese can the General Mobilization for National Spirit be effectively carried out, and the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction can finally be completed. Work hard, overseas Chinese opinion leaders!</p>

<h3>Emergency Work of the Shanghai YMCA</h3>
<p>— From America</p>
<p>Recalling that since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the westward retreat of the National Army, the Shanghai Christian YMCA, as a Christian social service organization, has been engaging in social services from its inherent standpoint, adhering to the grand aspiration of establishing oneself and others, and striving to undertake various regular and emergency tasks. Thanks to the struggle and efforts of its colleagues, as well as the support and cooperation of people from all walks of life, it has achieved considerable success over the past year. Currently, at this critical juncture, the association is undertaking practical service work, encouraging the youth, and maintaining a positive spirit, all of which depend on the multifaceted assistance of people from all walks of life to benefit the society and its compatriots. A summary report on the association's work over the past year is presented below:</p>
<p>(1) Relief Work</p>
<p>A. Refugee Camps – Immediately after the outbreak of the war, the association took the lead in organizing six refugee camps, including the Shanghai International Relief Committee's third and sixth camps, the Guangdong Association in Shanghai Refugee Relief Committee's first and second camps, and the Shanghai Christian Federation's refugee camps. At its peak, the camps housed over 27,000 refugees. In addition to dispatching responsible staff members to preside over the camps, the association paid special attention to life skills training, character education, and the knowledge and skills of productive endeavors, with the ultimate goal of cultivating the "four virtues" and fostering character development. Therefore, it strived for scientific administration and management, emphasized discipline in daily life, and adopted an objective attitude to achieve the purpose of educating the masses. Indeed, the cleanliness and orderliness of the camps, as well as the well-organized life of the refugees, are sufficient proof of the camps' excellent management.</p>
<p>B. Relief for Students Who Have Lost Their Schooling! Initially, in view of the urgency of the need, the association joined forces with the YWCA to raise funds to subsidize students from impoverished families who were directly affected by the war and lacked the ability to pursue their studies. The methods included: (1) providing tuition loans and funding to study in the interior, establishing work-study quotas, and scholarships. To date, a total of more than 600 students have benefited, with a total of 17,000 yuan in relief funds disbursed. Unfortunately, due to limited financial resources, more than 1,000 students who registered were unable to receive assistance. (2) Establishing student economic dormitories, initially at the Sichuan Road Association, with extremely low room rates. Now, floors seven, eight, and nine of the Five Continents Building have been opened as student dormitories. The internal space is spacious, and the opening and operating costs are approximately 20,000 yuan, with annual operating expenses estimated at 6,000 yuan. It is hoped that this will foster a spirit of fellowship and an ideal student dormitory life for young scholars.</p>
<p>C: Relief for Unemployed Youth! In addition to vocational guidance work, a production education plan is proposed, divided into four groups: teaching, crafts, sales, and job placement. Soon after, the "Production Education Sales Team" was established, with the goal of promoting domestic goods. The team is temporarily limited to 50 members. Since its establishment, the members have worked hard and maintained excellent morale. Moreover, the team members themselves have focused on training and self-cultivation, benefiting greatly in body and mind. Unfortunately, due to its recent establishment and limited manpower and capital, it is still difficult to expand on a large scale.</p>
<p>D: Military Service Work – At the beginning of the Shanghai War, the association was invited to send personnel to serve at the Municipal Ambulance Association. In addition, personnel were sent to work in various wounded soldier hospitals, divided into general affairs, publicity, personnel, comfort, service (education and entertainment), and other groups, serving a total of eight hospitals, of which the 23rd Wounded Soldier Hospital was the most prominent, with a total of more than 70 service personnel. It also solicited comfort items and made cotton vests, making a significant contribution to the spiritual comfort and encouragement of wounded soldiers. Subsequently, due to the withdrawal of the National Army, this work could not continue in Shanghai, which is regrettable. However, now that the war zone is vast, YMCA branches across the country have long been united in talent and economy, engaging in large-scale military service work. In the military areas stretching thousands of miles, they are still working tirelessly amidst hardship and determination. There are now dozens of branches, with more than 150 service personnel formally appointed by the National YMCA. All of them are braving death and danger, personally serving the soldiers at the front and the wounded soldiers being transported back. As a result, the reputation of the YMCA in the interior has become greatly enhanced. Whether soldiers or civilians, upon seeing the red triangle, all know it is the YMCA. This is because the service personnel all embrace a spirit of fearlessness, continuing their work despite the risks, thereby earning the respect and faith of their compatriots and soldiers. It is truly a great undertaking.</p>
<p>(2) Physical Education Work</p>
<p>A. Building a Temporary Gymnasium – The association's Baxianqiao New Association originally had a plan to build a new gymnasium. After Shanghai formed an "isolated island," youth sports work became a great necessity. Recognizing this, the association sought the cooperation and support of physical education professionals and association members, and quickly built a temporary gymnasium on the site of the new gymnasium to meet urgent needs. It was completed and opened on July 16, with a total construction and equipment cost of more than 17,000 yuan. To date, it has been heavily used, making a significant contribution to promoting youth health and encouraging interest in physical education.</p>
<p>(3) Labor Children's Welfare Undertaking</p>
<p>A. West Shanghai Commune – The association's West Shanghai Commune on Robert Road is specifically established to handle labor welfare undertakings. Various tasks, such as education, religion, hygiene, medicine, etc., all meet the actual needs of the lives of the working masses. It continues to be handled and pays special attention to the education of workers' children. There are 250 students in the morning and afternoon classes. Religious gatherings, hygiene work (such as setting up children's bathrooms, etc.) and medical services serve approximately 30 to 50 poor and sick children who come to the commune every day.</p>
<p>(4) Children's Science Laboratory</p>
<p>In addition to day and night schools, the association's intellectual education work includes the libraries and reading rooms of the two associations. In recent years, the number of young people reading has often reached full capacity, and the collection in the libraries is very rich, with all kinds of books and magazines available, which has greatly benefited the people's intelligence. Recently, in order to encourage children's interest in science and lay the foundation for cultivating scientific talents for the country, a children's laboratory was established at the Sichuan Road branch. It officially opened on the 12th. To date, both children and adults have participated. Detailed content has been published in the newspaper, so it will be omitted here.</p>

<h3>International Figures Pay Attention to Our Counter-Offensive Strength, Unanimously Believe That Our Country Will Win the Final Victory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 20th] European newspapers publish less news about the Far East due to the tension in Europe.

People from international circles in Geneva are increasingly hopeful for our country and hope that China can increase its democratic strength so that the strength of totalitarian countries can be balanced in the future. All circles unanimously believe that our country can win the final victory.</p>
<h3>Britain Officially Denies Mediation in Sino-Japanese War, British Ambassador Visits President Kong</h3>

<p>The Times of London, We Fight More Bravely</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] The Times editorial today stated that China's recent successful counter-offensive is extremely important and should not be underestimated, because it is sufficient to prove that after two years of resistance, China's morale has become stronger and has not been discouraged by setbacks. Not only that, the Chinese army has always made full preparations, and its cooperation with each other is also more advanced than before, so it can launch this counter-offensive. The Chinese army's attack on Kaifeng is even more significant than the encirclement of Guangzhou, because the Chinese army's attack on Kaifeng has completely broken the Japanese plan to use Wu Peifu. As for the war in Guangzhou, although the Chinese army's strength cannot recover Guangzhou in one fell swoop, its impact on morale is significant.</p>

<h3>Giving Play to the People's Strength in Resistance, Guangxi Promotes Democratic Politics, Military, Internal Affairs, and Education Departments Issue Orders Nationwide, Soldiers Should Be Saluted When Encountering Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 20th] The Guangxi Provincial Government has recently formulated an outline of the 28th annual administrative plan, which particularly emphasizes: 1. Promoting local autonomy in many ways and deeply planting the foundation of constitutional government; 2. Making every effort to expand production and achieve self-sufficiency in wartime; 3. Intensifying various militia trainings and enriching self-defense effectiveness. In terms of politics, it is to complete the conditions for local autonomy, improve administrative efficiency, improve financial administration, and determine the wartime financial plan to improve the people's ability to resist. In terms of economy, it is to determine economic policies, improve economic organizations, and revitalize various industries. In terms of culture, it is to improve basic schools, popularize adult education, and improve secondary education.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Since the launch of the full-scale War of Resistance, our loyal and brave soldiers have been fighting bravely on the battlefield, fulfilling their duty to defend the territory and protect the country, and those who are wounded and return to the rear for treatment should be deeply respected by the people. At the February conscription conference this year, the proposal that people across the country salute wounded soldiers at any time and any place was passed. It has now been ordered by the military, internal affairs, and education departments to all military, political, and educational institutions and organizations across the country to comply with it, and the political department of the Military Commission has ordered political departments at all levels to inform soldiers of this purpose and implement it conscientiously. The original proposal is recorded as follows: "Whenever and wherever wounded soldiers are encountered, a salute should be given. Those wearing military police uniforms and student uniforms should raise their hands to salute, and those walking should still salute. Those wearing long shirts and casual clothes should bow. The recipient of the salute should return the salute."</p>
<h3>The Invader Area Work Group of Jin-Cha-Sui Province</h3>
<p>[Jinxi Correspondence] The Second Theater of Operations' General Mobilization Committee is about to transfer to work in a different area. There are reasons for this. After working in an area for a considerable period and achieving considerable results, it should naturally turn to a more backward area to start new work. However, the most important reason is still the need for objective environment under the new situation. At present, when the War of Resistance has entered a new stage, and when developing invader area work deep behind enemy lines has become the most important task of the Chinese nation today, the General Mobilization Committee should not and will not be attached to the old place and stand still. Fortunately, the Brotherly Sacrifice League, which is under the General Mobilization Committee, is still left in northwestern Shanxi to continue to lead the people's movement work. This is the reason why the former can move forward with peace of mind, but the latter's task is therefore even more important.</p>
<p>After receiving the formal order to transfer the area, all the comrades of the General Mobilization Committee felt extremely excited. Although the General Mobilization Committee had sent some comrades to southeastern Sui, southern Chahar, and northern Yan in the past to carry out invader area work, most of the comrades still could not leave the stifling and confined northwestern Shanxi. Now that there is an opportunity to go to the vast invader area to develop new territory, it will naturally make them dance with joy. The destination of the transfer is the Yanbei ×× and ×× area. The work area includes a dozen counties in Yanbei and the entire territory of Chahar and Suiyuan. These areas were originally within the scope of the General Mobilization Committee's work area, so this transfer makes it easier for the General Mobilization Committee to complete its original mission.</p>
<p>After transferring the area, the General Mobilization Committee ended the work in the area where it was located on the one hand, and prepared for the future work on the other hand, leading the mobilization work in many counties in northwestern Shanxi. With a huge organization at the county, district, and level, including thousands of excellent young cadres, can its work be ended abruptly? In order not to affect the local work, the General Mobilization Committee arranged new partial work while ending the work during this transition period. It set such a purpose, that is, to be responsible for the work for one day while staying in northwestern Shanxi. During this period, its central task was to do its best to help other people's movement groups. Cultivating the people's anti-Japanese forces, for example, on the issue of cadres, the cadres of the Mobilization Committee should in principle and are willing to set off with the General Mobilization Committee. However, in order to support the local people's movement work, the General Mobilization Committee did not hesitate to leave a considerable number of cadres to the recent counties in northwestern Shanxi to organize the Anti-Invader Support Association. In the instruction letter to the counties, the General Mobilization Committee emphasized, "During this period, the Mobilization Committee of each county must quickly launch and organize the Anti-Invader Support Association of each county and strengthen its work. ... The Mobilization Committee should not passively abandon its work task for one day without leaving the work area. Especially at this time when the Mobilization Committee is transferring the area, it should show our infinite enthusiasm for work and actively implement the government's order to organize the Anti-Invader Support Association..."</p>
<p>When the masses in various places heard about the end of the General Mobilization Committee, there were many doubts and speculations. Some backward elements took the opportunity to spread rumors. The General Mobilization Committee also specifically pointed out in the instruction letter to various counties: "Regarding the preparatory work for transferring the area, it is particularly important to explain the significance of the General Mobilization Committee's transfer to the masses... If the mass organizations cannot correctly understand the positive significance of the General Mobilization Committee's transfer, their emotions may fall and their work may become passive: at the same time, some backward elements have always had a negative attitude towards the government's wartime anti-Japanese policy facilities, and have always been dissatisfied with the General Mobilization Committee's assistance to the government in helping mass organizations carry out various anti-Japanese work. The order to transfer the area by the commander must be distorted. The General Mobilization Committee should estimate these problems, estimate the possible problems, and solve them with special caution."</p>
<p>In recent days, some local cadres in various counties have successively returned to the General Mobilization Committee after completing their work. A group of "cart drivers" suddenly increased in Lan City (the comrades of the General Mobilization Committee all wore a sheepskin coat without a cloth surface. Some people once thought they were cart drivers). Before the official departure, the General Mobilization Committee held symposiums on various work issues, such as organization work, propaganda work, elimination of traitors work, invader army work, and political work, and collective learning, in order to enable the old cadres in the counties to review the work of the past year and exchange mutual opinions and experiences. In addition, several enlarged symposiums were held to discuss the following issues: a review of the General Mobilization Committee's work over the past year, the understanding that should be had of the transfer area, how to carry out invader area work, how to establish guerrilla bases, and how to smash the invader's appeasement policy.</p>
<p>After the General Mobilization Committee transfers the area, there will be some changes in name and organization. The name will be changed to the Invader Area Work Group. In terms of organization, the current General Affairs Office will be changed to the Secretariat, the Traitor Elimination Department will be changed to the Special Affairs Department, and the Mobilization Allocation Department will be abolished. The organization of each department will also be slightly changed to be more flexible and capable.</p>
<p>The departure of the General Mobilization Committee is not a lone army deep into the enemy lines, and it is equipped with considerable armed forces. These armed forces - including *支队, * 特务队, about * thousands of people - are the concrete manifestation of its mobilization achievements in northwestern Shanxi for more than a year. These troops all have considerable combat experience. With so many mass armed forces and such rich work experience, "The General Mobilization Committee must be able to mobilize the vast invader area masses and widely develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, destroy the invader's puppet regime, and restore our regime. We wish the General Mobilization Committee great success in its future work; [Ming Ge Society]</p>
<h3>Shanghai Citizens Enthusiastically Promote the General Mobilization of the National Spirit; Two Hundred Branches to Be Established Soon; People from Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Sectors Are Also Rising Up</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Dispatch] The 18th was the Citizens' Publicity Day for the National Spiritual Mobilization Publicity Week. The Shanghai Citizens' National Spiritual Mobilization Association specially issued a declaration, detailing the importance of the meaning of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and the urgency of its implementation. The association is now enthusiastically promoting the establishment of branches in the citizen sector and expects to establish at least 200 or more branches during this publicity week. Those who formally participate in the national covenant swearing-in are expected to be around 50,000 people. The 19th is the Publicity Day for the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. The persons in charge of the National Spiritual Mobilization Associations of the three sectors will hold a joint meeting, resolving, in addition to issuing a declaration to the compatriots of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, pointing out the work that should be strived for at present, and also mobilizing all sectors of the city to enthusiastically hang flags. On the morning of the 19th, all stores, factories, and residences in the city flew the national flag, which was extremely enthusiastic, as a concrete manifestation of the efforts of all our citizens to promote the general mobilization of the national spirit. The declaration of the citizen sector is now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Strive Together, Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>Our country's war of resistance has been going on for nearly two years. Due to the leadership measures of the Supreme Leader of the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek, the loyal sacrifices of the frontline soldiers, and the solid unity of the national record, the rampant flames of the invaders have been thwarted, astonishing the world. Now the war of resistance has reached the second stage. The importance of the first stage lies in changing from a defensive to an offensive posture, from a passive to an active one, so that the war can quickly transition into a decisive battle for a general counteroffensive, with the goal of recovering lost territory and establishing a new China with freedom and equality. To achieve this goal, relying solely on the military, weapons, and strategic defense is not enough. It is necessary to implement a general mobilization of the national spirit, so that all the people of the country are under a unified organization, have a common belief, embrace a common goal, and sacrifice and struggle for national salvation and nation-building. In the past, some people thought that China was a weak country, and whether in terms of weapons or strategic defense, it was far inferior to the aggressors. Using a weak country to resist a strong country, even with a long-term war of resistance, it would be difficult to seize the power of inevitable victory. Therefore, they first harbored a fear of the invaders. Some people were overjoyed when they heard of victories at the front, but when they heard of the loss of a famous city, they felt disappointed and embarked on a path of negativity and decadence. Even more people only knew about their current temporary safety, forgetting the imminent danger, and left resistance to its own course, not caring about how to save the country. These people, because they had no center in their consciousness and lost their mastery in their spirit, expressed themselves in a chaotic and complex manner, beyond resolution. As a result, it would inevitably directly or indirectly affect the future of the war of resistance. Now China has reached a time of life-and-death, and every citizen should be a combatant in the war of resistance, using the strength of 450 million people to defend the country and expel the aggressors. Only then can the final victory be guaranteed. The war of resistance certainly relies on economic and weapon superiority, but the economy must be controlled by people, and weapons must also be used by people. Only a great spirit can control everything.</p>
<p>War of Resistance and Nation-Building Advance Side by Side</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is surrounded and threatened by the aggressors, we believe that the majority of citizens have not forgotten the country or ignored the war of resistance. For example, donating money to relieve difficulties and eradicate traitors and promote culture have all demonstrated an indomitable spirit of activism. Even more countless young people want to save the country, but feel that there is no way to save the country on an isolated island. Apart from this, they see a life of drunken stupor, a habit of living in degradation, selfish and self-interested attempts, and even divisive and irrational thoughts, all of which are everywhere. Since the ranks have been disrupted and beliefs are not concentrated, how can we save the country and strive for the final victory? Isn't it like climbing a tree to catch fish, where the fish can never be obtained? Therefore, the meaning of the general mobilization of the national spirit is to unify and expand the organization of the people, correct all past unreasonable or even detrimental habits, lives, and thoughts that hinder the war of resistance, and take the country above all, the nation above all, the military first, and victory first as the common goal of our efforts. At the same time, do not forget that China's war of resistance is a war of national revolution, that is, the premise of implementing the Three Principles of the People, including nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. We must not only strive to resist aggression and achieve final victory, but also build a new China with equal national status, equal political status, and equal economic status. Therefore, during the war, we must advance the revolutionary and constructive aspects of the Three Principles of the People side by side, striving for final victory on the one hand, and building the nation on the other, in order to establish a new country with freedom and equality.</p>
<p>Conscientiously Implement the Prescribed Outline</p>
<p>The central government's decision to root the foundation of the war of resistance and the outline for nation-building is a fundamental plan that integrates theory and practice. If the people of the whole country consistently follow it, the life, actions, spiritual undertakings during the war will all be combative and constructive, and they can be coordinated with the national policy of resisting aggression and building the nation. Everyone has this belief, that is, everyone has this spirit and activity. Through common belief, we trust each other, and through unity, we struggle. With the great power of 450 million people, we save China and build China. The final victory will surely follow like a shadow, arriving as expected. Our association has now been established following the establishment of the headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal National Spiritual Mobilization Association. We deeply hope that citizens who have not yet become members will enthusiastically participate. Every citizen should take the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline as a guide, without abandoning or neglecting it, and conscientiously implement it. From then on, life habits will be renewed, and group struggles will become more and more fierce. We will see a vigorous atmosphere where all industries, with the overall goal of national and ethnic military victory, take on the great mission of saving the country, saving people, and saving themselves. The country is fortunate, the war of resistance is fortunate.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Hold Anti-Wang Meeting; Students in Manila Request the Elimination of Traitors; High Morale Among People in Gansu and Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Manila 21st Dispatch] Since the exposure of Wang Jingwei's plot to collude with the aggressor nation, the anti-traitor sentiments of overseas Chinese here have been rising. The Federation of Overseas Chinese Students yesterday sent a telegram to the government requesting the severe punishment of the national traitor Wang Jingwei, saying that since the national traitor Wang Jingwei betrayed the central government and sought glory by betraying the country, he has repeatedly sent his henchmen, such as a certain Li, to the Philippines to engage in activities, even inciting our overseas Chinese to resist the central government and resist the supreme leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. This kind of unscrupulous behavior has caused our overseas Chinese to feel deeply pained. In order to prevent problems before they arise, we have united with various student associations in this port to hold an anti-Wang meeting. We earnestly request the government to issue a clear order to condemn the traitor Wang, in order to uphold national law and benefit the future of the war of resistance. The country is fortunate, the national flag is fortunate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Lanzhou 20th Dispatch] The Provincial Capital's All Sectors National Covenant Swearing-in Conference was held at the East Suburb Field at 3 pm on the 20th, with more than 40,000 citizens attending. At the same time, a National Monthly Meeting was also held, with quite enthusiastic circumstances.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Wuyuan 19th Dispatch] Since the enemy invaded Suiyuan, the people of western Suiyuan have been filled with hatred. Liu Cunyi and other farmers in Anbei, feeling that they are too old to rush to the battlefield and fight with the enemy, specially used the money they have saved over the years to purchase pocket carts and other items to donate to the government to facilitate transportation. It is estimated that Liu Cunyi, a farmer from Taiyu Township in Anbei, and Jiang Jisheng, a villager from Taiji Township, each donated 200 cotton cloth wheat sacks, and Hou Shengrong, a farmer from Taiping Township, donated 20 soft stretchers. Chairman Chuan reported back, saying that Liu and others deeply understood the great righteousness and made contributions to saving the country, and immediately gave them special awards to express their condolences and encouragement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Shanghai Build Opium Dens; Robbery in the French Concession; Value Reaches a Huge Amount of 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Shanghai 21st Dispatch] Outside the Public Concession here this morning, a robbery of opium worth 100,000 yuan occurred. It was found that the batch of opium was transported from the Japanese-occupied area, via the Suzhou River, and arrived at Jessfield Road at 5:30 am. It was immediately loaded onto a truck and driven to Route Tenant de la Tour, guarded by six puppet police officers, two of whom were armed. Later, on Route Tenant de la Tour, they were stopped by six people, disarmed, and expelled. An hour later, the truck was found in the French Concession, and all the opium inside had been robbed.</p>
<h3>The Assassination of Zeng Zhongming (3)</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhuoming</p>
<p>The first, Yao Dongshan (transliteration), 28 years old, from Shandong, with a passport issued by Yunnan, resided at 59 Lien Tri Street, Hanoi, starting from March 7th. He rarely went out during the week. On the night of the 20th to the 21st, a Chinese person wearing a suit and riding a bicycle came to call him out. The second, Yuan Bosan (transliteration), 28 years old, from Guangxi, also came to Hanoi from Haiphong on the 7th and lived in the Southwest Hotel on Yun Chi Street. His passport was issued by Hong Kong. The third, Weng Weihai (transliteration), 29 years old, from Anhui, lived in the Tongli Hotel. The fourth, Lu Zhenxi (transliteration), 35 years old, from Anhui, came to Hanoi from Haiphong on March 7th and lived in the room next to Yuan Bosan in the Southwest Hotel. All four have already been arrested. However, they do not have the slightest worry. Look, readers, they are actually smiling!</p>
<p>After their arrest, they confessed truthfully that they assassinated Zeng Zhongming and declared: This is indeed an act of punishing traitors.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>It is said that shortly after the above-mentioned group of assassins was arrested, a small number of young overseas Chinese in Hanoi gathered in front of the Chinese Consulate General in Hanoi, asking Consul General Xu to find a way to rescue the arrested people. The so-called right and wrong are naturally in people's hearts, which is another proof. They said shamelessly that they had been working for the country for more than 20 years and deeply regretted it, bragging about themselves, but what is the use?</p>
<p>The French-language Vietnamese Will (La Volonte Indochinoise) recently published a photo of Wang Jingwei in one of its newspapers, with the following title: (Wang Cbfng Wei, Traitrea SrPatie) "Wang Jingwei, Traitor of the Motherland." We think this is a very appropriate statement.</p>
<p>After the Zeng case occurred, not only did most of the overseas Chinese here feel "great satisfaction," but even the French and Annamese expressed sympathy. It is said that foreigners generally have the following view of the Zeng case: "The murdered deserved to die, and the murderer is a hero."</p>
<p>An editorial in the same newspaper on April 8, titled "Tokyo Province Does Not Need Wang Jingwei," is quite valuable and shows the general French opinion of Wang. Here is a summary:</p>
<p>"Wang Jingwei, who betrayed China, still lives in Hanoi. Since the incident on Cầu Giấy Street, his life has been spared, and his security has become even tighter than before. Wang's residence has become a fortress, with thick steel plates on the doors and more bodyguards. Not only that, but the police station has also assigned two French and several Annamese detectives to protect Wang Jingwei.</p>
<p>We think this situation is very strange and cannot continue. Of course, we do not deny that the Annamese authorities have a responsibility to protect foreigners who have fled here and to maintain local order, but this requires money and also involves some danger. As for money, Wang Jingwei will pay it; but it is the French and Annamese who risk danger. (Reporter's note: The French and Annamese who risk danger must refer to those responsible for guarding Wang.) All this is for a Chinese person (we don't recognize him as a Chinese person—reporter) who, in his actions, receives no sympathy from the French and Annamese. Naturally, Wang Jingwei's collusion with the aggressors of China has its reasons, but it has aroused the anger and search of Chinese patriotic youth. He fled to Annam for his pitiful life. All this is his own business, not our fault. Why should we spend useful money and ask our French or Annamese people to risk their lives for him!</p>
<p>We believe this is a matter between him and the Chinese. If he needs assistance, he should ask his Japanese friends to handle this costly and dangerous matter. We in Annam have already fulfilled our hospitality to Wang Jingwei. Now he should get out of here! …</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei of ×× should leave here immediately! If he is still reluctant to leave, the government should expel him!"</p>
<p>Similar arguments have repeatedly appeared in the newspaper. On the 14th of this month, there was another commentary advocating Wang's expulsion. Wang Jingwei, where are you going to escape! (End)</p>
<p>April 14th in Hanoi</p>
<p>The photo shows Lu Zhenxi, who was arrested as an assassin.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Proposes Implementing Cessation of Aggression; Willing to Cooperate Without Limits with Britain and France; British Cabinet Attaches Great Importance and is Currently Studying</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 21st Dispatch] In the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, there is a certain proposal from the Soviet side. The British and French governments are paying close attention to this proposal. The proposal was put forward following suggestions from other countries participating in the negotiations, that is, to strive to find ways to stop aggression. Informed sources pointed out that the countries participating in the negotiations have not yet been able to know what form will be adopted to stop aggression. It is said that the constructive proposal of the Soviet Union is very helpful. However, the current negotiations have not yet reached the final decision. It is heard that the Soviet proposal did not mention the Far East issue. Also, the general situation of the negotiations is extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>[Reuters Teacher 21st Dispatch] The diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" said, "The curtain has now been lifted on Britain's invitation to the Soviet Union to join the anti-aggression front. The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union has proposed to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov that the Soviet Union should be prepared to guarantee assistance to Romania and Poland in the most convenient way. Last week, Moscow was hesitant about whether to accept this proposal. Mr. Kalinin also doubted the practical value of Britain's guarantee to Poland and Romania. He was also very unhappy that the Soviet Union was not invited to discuss the formation of the anti-aggression front in the early stages. However, the Soviet Union has now put forward a constructive proposal, clearly stating that it is willing to cooperate without limits with Britain and France, guaranteeing to resist the Axis countries' aggression in Europe with all its strength and resources. The British Cabinet should now consider the impact of this proposal of the Soviet Union on the attitude and political and geographical situation of some small countries. According to the implication from Berlin, if Britain and the Soviet Union strengthen contact, then the opportunity for Hitler to deliver a peace speech a week later will be destroyed. This implication has failed to deter the British government from stopping the exchange of opinions and joint cooperation with the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 20th Dispatch] The British government initiated the organization of an anti-aggression group and is negotiating with the Soviet Union, intending to invite the country to join and sign a treaty, hoping to guarantee that neighboring countries will not be subjected to aggression. It is now learned that the Soviet government has already submitted an answer, which is being studied by the British Cabinet. It is heard that the content includes four points: (1) If Eastern and Western Europe want to form an anti-aggression group, then the participating countries must establish an agreement to unite with each other, so as to appease Romania and Poland. (2) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign an unconditional mutual assistance treaty, which should be supplemented by an agreement established by the general staff of each country. This is the only possible basis for a collective security system. (3) The security guarantees provided by Britain and France to Romania and Poland apply to any aggression that can be imposed on these countries, which may include the Soviet Union in the list of aggressor countries and should be revised as a guarantee against Germany. (4) Poland and Romania should first establish an agreement to prevent German aggression, and then the Soviet Union can provide guarantees to these countries.</p>
<h3>Europe and the Far East Cannot Be Separated; Eden Calls for United Anti-Aggression; Ambassador Guo Says We Should Be Invited to Join</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 20th Dispatch] Former Foreign Secretary Eden, speaking to 7,000 people in Billington today, advocated the adoption of a "Triple Peace Policy": (1) It should be recognized that the aggressor's golden age has passed; (2) The restoration of international credibility should be completed with a peace front; (3) In any aspect, whether domestic or foreign, including the work of concentrating all financial, human, and industrial resources, Britain must exert its greatest efforts. Eden stated, "The world cannot continue to live in peace under the threat of destruction. We must seek a system or method to stop this threat of violence. Otherwise, we will inevitably suffer disaster, and the suffering of future generations will be even greater than ours."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 20th Dispatch] The "Yorkshire Post," a machine war organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden, which is known for its well-informed sources, published an article today, stating that the anti-aggression front initiated by the British government may be expanded to the Far East. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi had previously discussed this issue with Foreign Secretary Halifax on the 18th of this month. As is generally known, the current anti-aggression Chen Xian organizational procedures are divided into three steps: (1) Britain and France provide guarantees to Poland, Greece, and Romania, which has already been done; (2) Britain intends to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, which is about to be completed; (3) The collective security system will be promoted in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 21st Dispatch] The Lancashire Report yesterday wrote an article discussing the expansion of the anti-aggression front, stating that Europe and the Far East cannot be separated. The existence of the German, Italian, and Japanese axis is enough to make us understand this point. U.S. President Roosevelt ordered the fleet to return to the Pacific on the same day as he sent a telegram to Germany and Italy, and the reason is also here.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 21st Dispatch] This Wednesday, Labour Party Member of Parliament Henderson asked Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons whether the British government was considering the need to urge Far Eastern countries such as China to unite with other countries to jointly oppose aggression. After the Prime Minister gave an affirmative answer, British political figures paid close attention. According to sources, before Henderson raised the question in the House of Commons, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi had already held preliminary consultations with Foreign Secretary Halifax and Deputy Secretary Butler on this point. The Foreign Secretary and Deputy Secretary also took a sympathetic attitude on this point. Even if Henderson had not raised the question, other members would have raised it to the Prime Minister. It is generally believed that after the completion of the British-Soviet talks and the Soviet Union joined the anti-aggression Chen Xian, inviting China to join again will mean that the establishment of the anti-aggression front has entered the third stage. Chinese Ambassador Guo told reporters yesterday that some people may mistakenly believe that inviting China to join the anti-aggression Chen Xian is tantamount to closing the door after failure. However, there is an old Chinese saying, "It is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep." What we are concerned about is the future. The Manchester City Innovation Society is scheduled to host a banquet for Ambassador Guo Taiqi today, at which time the Ambassador will deliver a speech. The Ambassador is also scheduled to speak in the central English town of today and Bolton tomorrow evening.</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Passes Bill; Builds Naval and Air Force Bases; Most of the Fleet Sails to the Pacific; Lindbergh Advocates Expanding the Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington 20th Dispatch] The National Defense Bill, which is scheduled to allocate US$66.8 million for the construction of naval and air force bases, was finally passed by the House of Representatives tonight after amendments and has been sent to the White House for approval. The Senate proposed an amendment to allocate an additional US$11 million to build an air force base in Jacksonville, which has been passed without objection.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 20th Dispatch] Most of the ships of the United States Fleet set sail from Hampton Rhodes, Virginia, this morning, passing through the Panama Canal and heading to the Pacific. In the future, only the ships belonging to the Atlantic Fleet will remain in the Atlantic, with a total of five cruisers, six submarines, and one aircraft carrier, and one repair ship.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 20th Dispatch] Colonel Lindbergh, who recently joined the Air Force Headquarters to serve with special tasks, met with President Roosevelt today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 20th Dispatch] Colonel Lindbergh declared today that the United States must lead the world in aviation research and improve the quality of aircraft in order to cope with any eventuality. It is understood that Lindbergh had discussed general air force strength with President Roosevelt, paying particular attention to Germany. However, this news has not been officially confirmed. Lindbergh briefly said, "In the aircraft manufacturing industry, quality is more important than quantity. The United States should immediately take practical steps to expand the aviation industry and assist in expanding the aviation industry of Latin American countries, as these countries may be the most difficult to defend."</p>
<h3>Germany Builds Roads Across the Border; Poland Firmly Opposes; Attitude Toward Danzig Becomes More Rigid</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Warsaw 20th Dispatch] The Polish authorities have issued a statement expressing their opposition to Germany's construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor, and their attitude is so firm. The situation of the Free City of Danzig has changed, for three reasons: (1) If the members of the National Socialist Party in the city start an uprising, there is very little hope of success. Its strength is very different from all the Polish forces. The Polish government has also decided to deal with it by force. (2) If Germany takes military action against the city, it may cause a major war, so it must be cautious about the matter. (3) Once the League of Nations Council meets to discuss the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the position of the High Commissioner stationed in the city will likely be fundamentally canceled. If so, there will be room for direct discussion and compromise between Germany and Poland on the issue of sovereignty over the city.</p>
<h3>"Paris" Steamer; Passengers' Treasures; Transferred to Another Ship Bound for New York</h3>
<p>[Reuters Le Havre 20th Dispatch] The mail steamer "Champlain" sailed to New York today, carrying the passengers and treasures of the fire-stricken and sunken "Paris" steamer. Among the passengers were Mrs. Lindbergh and her two children.</p>
<h3>Civil Air Defense; Domestic Defense Inquiries Advocate Universally Establishing Shelters</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 21st Dispatch] The Domestic Defense Advisory Council, chaired by Admiral Hylton, today released a report on air raid shelters. The report does not favor deep underground shelters to accommodate all residents, but advocates building shelters scattered in various places to avoid bomb fragments and rubble. This policy is a way to complete steps to protect people in a considerable period of time, which is very important. There are three main reasons for opposing the construction of deep underground shelters: (1) The need for materials, manpower, and money is huge, which affects actual national defense. (2) The difficulty in construction. (3) The need for a long construction period. For example, building a 16-mile-long underground shelter in London would take two years and could only accommodate 160,000 people. The report also supports the construction of steel shelters.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia; Public Sentiment Is High; Military and Civilians Are Wary of Germany and Italy; Reservists Continue to Enlist</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Yugoslav Capital 20th Dispatch] Today, a team of Bulgarian students arrived in Sarajevo, and the crowd warmly welcomed them and staged a demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Down with Hitler, down with Mussolini, we demand an alliance with Bulgaria." The police immediately intervened and arrested about 30 people. Here, reservists continue to be called up for enlistment. Since the order needs to be distributed and reported, it is difficult to count the exact number. However, it is believed that the number of those called up for enlistment is more than 300,000. Italian radio broadcasts claimed that the number had reached 600,000. These reservists marched in formation, shouting slogans such as "Down with Hitler and Mussolini," which made the government authorities feel difficult.</p>
<h3>General Secretary's Speech: Strict Neutrality, Presenting Territorial Demands to Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Sofia, 20th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov, at a secret meeting of the Bulgarian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that Bulgaria has always adopted a strict neutral stance in the current European situation. His policy is "wait and see." He has not received any invitations from any party to join any faction. He has not signed any secret treaties with any country to date. He guarantees that he will never sign such secret treaties or declare war on other countries without prior consultation with Parliament. He also stated that Bulgaria's demand for an outlet to the Aegean Sea through Strumica, from Thessaloniki, will be presented to Romania and Greece at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] According to the "Daily Mail's" Sofia correspondent, Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov stated in Parliament that the Bulgarian government has demanded the restoration of Bulgaria's borders to those before the 1913 Balkan Wars and World War I, including: (1) 3,000 square miles of Southern Dobruja under Romanian territory; (2) 3,250 square miles of eastern Greece to provide an outlet to the Aegean Sea; (3) 1,000 square miles of western Yugoslavia, including the Strumica region.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Announces Establishment of Ministry of Supply to Handle All Army Supplies, Mr. Burgin Nominated as Minister</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that the government has decided to introduce a proposal in the shortest possible time to establish a Ministry of Supply, and the minister of this department will be a member of the cabinet. The drafting of this proposal will ensure that the work of the department is absolutely satisfactory. The department will be responsible for managing certain essential supplies previously provided by the War Office to other departments, including some civil defense equipment. The establishment of the Ministry of Supply is an excellent system and will be gradually expanded as needed. The Ministry of Supply will handle all issues related to army supplies. Following the recent decision to strengthen the army, the need for supplies has greatly increased. The department will also be responsible for sourcing and maintaining essential metals and all necessary raw materials related to national defense plans. The parts of the War Office that should be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Supply include research, design, testing, production, and inspection, as well as British ordnance factories. A system for prioritizing government orders will also be established. In this regard, there are suggestions to establish a Raw Materials Priority Committee, which was implemented once at the end of the last World War. As for the choice of minister, the current Minister of Transport, Dr. Burgin, will be recommended to fill the position. Labor leader Attlee asked why the Ministry of Supply only handles the supply of the War Office. Chamberlain replied that the current supply methods of the Navy and Air Force are already absolutely excellent. Any sudden changes or interference with these methods would not only fail to increase efficiency but would weaken it. However, if necessary in the future, the jurisdiction of the proposal can be changed to enable the Ministry of Supply to become an absolute supply department. Chamberlain also stated that another person will be appointed as Minister of Transport.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain to Make Statement on International Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] British Labor leader Attlee yesterday requested Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons to make a statement on the current international situation. The Prime Minister immediately agreed to make this statement in the near future.</p>
<h3>US Protests to Japan Again, Inadmissibility of Discrimination in Chinese Interests, Secretary Hull Issues Statement to the Press</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Regarding the rights and interests of American citizens in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles has verbally conveyed to the Japanese ambassador the U.S. government's dissatisfaction with the "restrictions" imposed by the Japanese side on the activities of American citizens in that area, during the Japanese ambassador's visit. Welles stated that the U.S. government demands that the Japanese side respect American merchants and missionaries in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Secretary of State Hull subsequently met with the press, stating that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew will raise this matter with the Japanese government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the press, stating, in brief, that it is unfair that Japanese military authorities do not allow American merchants to travel freely in the occupied areas of China, while Japanese merchants can come and go as they please. He has protested to the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Horita, and has instructed the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Grew, to protest to the Japanese government. U.S. officials in China will also negotiate with local Japanese authorities. It is noted that Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently issued a statement arguing that since Japan has discriminated against American interests, the United States should implement various economic measures as retaliation against Japanese trade. The U.S. government's protest to Japan is seen by diplomatic circles here as being related to Pittman's above-mentioned proposal.</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Arrives in Brussels, to Proceed to England for Negotiations Tomorrow, Departs for Paris on the 26th</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 21st] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, who was here last night, has met with the Belgian King. Before leaving Berlin, Gafencu told the "National Times" that his talks with Hitler were extremely sincere and that both countries benefited from the discussions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu left here at 9:26 PM this evening for Brussels. It is understood that he will meet with the Belgian King and Belgian dignitaries before proceeding to London. It is also understood that the Romanian Foreign Minister may also make a stop in Paris on his way to Rome.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 21st] It is announced here that Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will arrive in London from Brussels at 5:00 PM on Sunday afternoon. On Monday morning, he will hold his first meeting with British Foreign Secretary Halifax. In the afternoon, he will meet with British Prime Minister Chamberlain. On Tuesday, the British and Romanian Foreign Ministers will continue negotiations, and then the British King and Queen will host a banquet at Buckingham Palace. In the evening, the Romanian Foreign Minister will attend a banquet at the Romanian Embassy in the UK. On Wednesday morning, he will inspect the British Air Force, and in the afternoon, he will depart for France.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 21st] The Romanian delegation is scheduled to depart for Germany tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the Romanian-German trade agreement with the German government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th] It is reported that the German government has proposed to the Romanian government to guarantee the country's security for a period of 30 years to develop economic relations between the two countries, but this has not yet been confirmed. Observers here generally believe that Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's talks with German authorities in recent days have been very satisfactory. The attitude of the democratic countries is firm, but in reality, they are strong on the outside but weak on the inside. None of the countries on the European continent are willing to fight for Britain. Germany should continue its peaceful struggle to gain the living space that is vital to its survival.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bucharest, 20th] King Carol has left here and is believed to be heading to Donau in the upper reaches of the Danube River to meet with Prince Paul of Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>South African Federation Strengthens Police Force</h3>

<h3>Roman Official Gazette</h3>
<p>Italian-Hungarian Negotiations Harmonious</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 20th] Officials have announced that during the negotiations between Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, it was repeatedly stated that "the common intention of Hungary and Italy is to achieve justice and peace, which is a characteristic of the Rome-Berlin Axis." After the Hungarian Prime Minister left here yesterday, a communique was issued stating, "The Hungarian-Italian negotiations were held in an atmosphere of harmony and mutual understanding. Important issues concerning Central Europe and the Danube River region were discussed, with particular attention paid to recent events and the situation of the past month. Cooperation between the two friendly countries of Italy and Hungary will gradually increase."</p>
<h3>Strange Ship Discovered off Canadian Coast, Government Dispatches Ship for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 20th] It is reported that an unidentified submarine of unknown nationality has been discovered off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. The Canadian government is currently dispatching a ship to patrol and investigate. Minister of National Defence Mackenzie stated that, according to Colonel Reid's report, the submarine entered Halifax Harbour yesterday for reconnaissance. The government is closely investigating the matter. It has not yet been confirmed whether Colonel Reid's report is accurate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Ottawa, 20th] Canadian Minister of National Defence Mackenzie announced to the House of Commons today that the mysterious ship discovered in Halifax Harbour is not a submarine. The type of naval vessel is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>US Newspapers Unanimously Condemn Italian Prime Minister's Speech, Parisian Newspapers Also Have No Good Words, US President Awaits German Response</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] A State Department official said today that although Mussolini's rejection of Roosevelt's proposal is disappointing, there still seems to be room for cooperation. If the President wants to promote his guarantee of peace by resolving difficulties through conferences, he can also find a basis in Mussolini's speech. In fact, Mussolini also has some intention of seeking peace. He has not completely rejected the idea of holding a conference, but he has minimized the value of large-scale conferences. President Roosevelt does not have in mind the idea of convening a world disarmament, economic, and political conference. The conference he has in mind is mainly focused on economic issues, while disarmament issues are limited to countries that are extremely expanding their military, and political issues are limited to countries with a direct interest in Europe. State Department officials expect that Hitler's response will be in the same direction as Mussolini's speech. However, Hitler is currently consulting with Balkan countries on whether Poland, etc., feels threatened by Germany. He will only be able to express his views on President Roosevelt's proposal when he receives this response, so it will be delayed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Hull only saw the general outline of the Italian Prime Minister's speech in the newspapers and refused to comment. The State Department also said that it is not known whether the Italian Prime Minister's speech is the only response to President Roosevelt's telegram of the 14th of this month. The newspapers unanimously condemned it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] President Roosevelt will wait for Hitler to respond to his peace appeal before deciding whether to send U.S. Ambassador to Berlin Wilson back to his post. This news was learned by "United Press" from well-informed sources.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] Today, Mussolini's speech was met with approval and satisfaction from all walks of life here. Political circles believe that this, together with the reply to U.S. President Roosevelt, is a firm expression of solidarity between the Rome-Berlin Axis against democratic countries. One political commentator pointed out that Hitler always cites the boom in Germany's construction industry in his speeches as evidence that Germany intends to have peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th] Observers here say that when the Reichstag meets on the 28th of this month, Chancellor Hitler will immediately present a detailed response to President Roosevelt, which will reportedly condemn the self-interest of the democratic countries and the various injustices of the Treaty of Versailles. It will also state that Germany has made various proposals to establish justice and lay the foundation for peace, but they have been rejected by the democratic countries, so they could not be realized.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Newspapers here have no good words for Mussolini's speech last night in response to President Roosevelt. "Le Travail" commented on Mussolini's mention of a ten-year guarantee, saying that Hitler once suggested a mutual guarantee of peace in Europe for 25 years.</p>
<h3>German Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit Parades to Celebrate Hitler's Birthday</h3>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Situation in Eastern Guangdong and the Fujian Coast is Tense</h3>
<p>The progress of our army's counter-offensive on various fronts in recent days has inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese, and international public opinion has also paid close attention to this. However, while this counter-offensive is winning successive victories, we have also seen news of tense situations in the Chaoshan area of eastern Guangdong and the Fujian coast. What is the reason for this? What is the future trend? How should we respond?</p>
<p>We already know that the main focus of the Japanese military plan at present is to connect the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways, complete and consolidate the occupation east of the Eastern Line, and cooperate with military and anti-communist peace to establish a puppet central government and other political conspiracies in preparation for a new large-scale offensive. In order to accomplish this plan, the Japanese army's coveting of Changsha, Fuzhou, and Chaoshan is not surprising. However, because our counter-offensive against Guangzhou has made great progress in recent days, the Japanese feel it is even more necessary to immediately launch a war on the eastern side to seek relief. They have immediately launched threats against our Chaoshan and even the Fujian coast.</p>
<p>The preparation for the war of resistance in Chaoshan has been going on for almost two years. Fujian Province, in addition to having considerable war preparations early on, also has the advantage of terrain. This is an existing guarantee that we can prevent any Japanese threats and offensives. In particular, with the enthusiasm of our people in various places and the considerable development of guerrilla activities, we dare to assert that if the Japanese carry out a risky adventure, they will inevitably encounter serious resistance.</p>
<p>However, we do not fully possess the overwhelming power to stop the Japanese from attacking Guangdong and Fujian, especially since we have some serious defects and weaknesses in politics, especially in the mass movement. Therefore, today we must still demand that the authorities in Fujian and Guangdong follow the central government's national policy and the repeated instructions of the supreme leader, and under the highest principle of adhering to unity and adhering to the war of resistance, strengthen political progress, especially consolidate the united front of all parties, classes, and groups, strengthen the implementation of wartime democratic politics and improve administrative agencies at all levels, intensify the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, and give the people the democratic freedom to participate in the war of resistance. As much as possible, let the masses organize and arm themselves, and expand the movement to prepare for guerrilla warfare to defend their hometowns. At the same time, we must also intensify the movement to eliminate traitors and oppose Wang Jingwei, and thoroughly eliminate the words and actions of surrendering to Japan and selling the country, such as "anti-communism" and "peace". Only the active participation of the broad masses in assisting the government and the army is the greatest guarantee to prevent the Japanese from attacking!</p>
<p>The war in the hometown of overseas Chinese and the northwest of Guangdong and Fujian will be more widespread and cruel under the new strategy of the Japanese! Overseas Chinese in various places should intensify the mobilization of young and strong people and technical experts to return to the country and their hometowns to serve! We should also intensify donations to support the troops fighting against the Japanese and to relieve refugees!</p>

<h3>Refugees in Kam Tin Camp Are Cruelly Treated, Social Opinion Is Extremely Turbulent, Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter Urging the Medical Director to Pay Attention, Please Investigate the Physical Punishment of Refugees</h3>
<p>In the Kam Tin Refugee Camp, a pregnant woman who was detained in the camp died some days ago because she violated the rules by boiling medicine, resulting in the tragic death of one corpse and two lives. Following this, another incident occurred in which a refugee was beaten to death. After the refugees in the camp announced the tragedy and appealed to all parties, and after emergency relief investigations confirmed it, social opinion was turbulent, and all advocated severely punishing the perpetrators as a warning and to uphold humanitarianism. Sir Robert Ho Tung, the chief representative of the Chinese community in Hong Kong, also attached great importance to this and decided to personally go to the camp to investigate and report to the Hong Kong government authorities for fair handling. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce received an appeal letter from refugees in the Kam Tin Refugee Camp yesterday, and specifically forwarded the letter to the director of the camp, Director of Health Situ Yongjue, and urged him to pay attention to the matter. The letter stated, "Dear Sir, Our chamber has received a letter from refugees in the Kam Tin Refugee Camp complaining about abuse. Your Excellency is in charge of the supervision of the camp. I dare to present the original letter for your perusal, hoping you will pay attention to it and investigate the truth of the matter. I would be very grateful. As for the executives in the camp who often inflict physical punishment on the refugees, Your Excellency may not have heard of this. I also hope that you will investigate thoroughly. Cao Bi, Manager of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>New Central Market Fish Stalls Auctioned Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Robbers Dare to Hold Up Pedestrians in the Busiest Area. Six Robbers Commit Crime Near Gloucester Arcade. Police Intercept and Detain Four Suspects.</h3>
<p>At about 12:10 AM last night, a robbery involving six bandits and a young man occurred near the Gloucester Arcade on Pedder Street, which is under heavy police guard. The victim, named Zhu Pengliang (20 years old), lives at 62 Peel Street, Central. Zhu was walking home from Des Voeux Road Central into Pedder Street. When he reached the Gloucester Arcade, six men approached him. As they got close, one of the bandits suddenly grabbed Zhu's neck, threatening him and preventing him from making a sound. They then pushed him to the ground, searched him, and stole over six dollars in cash before fleeing in different directions. Zhu, unwilling to accept the loss, shouted for help. Police detectives on duty nearby responded and intercepted four suspects who were believed to be connected to the robbery of Zhu. They were taken back to the police station and charged. An arrest warrant has been issued for the remaining two bandits.</p>
<h3>Golden Gate Exposition to Open. Transpacific Steamships Reduce Fares. Round-Trip Tickets at 1.5 Times the One-Way Fare. Effective for Six Months Starting Next Month.</h3>
<p>President Lines and Chang Xing Steamship Company, which traverse the Pacific Ocean, have announced that round-trip fares to the Far East in April and May will be reduced compared to the one-way fare.

According to company representatives, this price reduction is purely to facilitate travel for people from the Far East to visit the Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco, and to encourage Americans to travel to the Far East.</p>
<h3>Where Is Our Path? The Sorrow of the Salaried Class</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Starting from the Request for Improved Treatment from Commercial Press Employees</p>
<p>Special Report by Our Newspaper</p>
<p>The salaried class is neither the extractor of "surplus value" in production nor as simple as the laboring class in consumption. They are neither numb nor blind. Therefore, "sorrow" is inextricably linked to the "salaried class," not just today, nor limited to Hong Kong. However, the fact that Hong Kong is particularly acute now is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the most obvious increase in the cost of living in Hong Kong is rent. In the Central and Wan Chai areas, rent has increased by 25%. Water fees require separate discussion. Subtenants are further exploited by landlords, with costs increasing by at least 50% compared to before the war. New tenants often face even greater increases. In Kowloon, rents have increased from eight or ten dollars to twenty-two dollars; new buildings with rentals as high as one hundred dollars per floor are common. Let's look at essential goods:</p>
<p>Before the War Now</p>
<p>Firewood: $1 for 120 catties... $1 for about 60 catties</p>
<p>Rice: $1 for 21 catties... $1 for 12 catties</p>
<p>Oil: 15 cents per catty... 22 cents per catty</p>
<p>Pork: 25 cents per catty... About 50 cents per catty</p>
<p>Beef: $1 for 5-6 pounds... $1 for less than 3 pounds</p>
<p>Vegetables: 10 cents for 3 catties... 10 cents for less than 1 catty</p>
<p>Other: ... All prices have increased</p>
<p>Consumption is so heavy, but income remains the same, or even decreases. This is a direct and major threat to the salaried class. As for those who came to Hong Kong for work, their plight is like tasting the bitter herb – unspeakable.</p>
<p>Some receive discounted salaries; some receive national currency but spend Hong Kong dollars; some still receive Hong Kong dollars, but consumption is higher than in the mainland. Income is decreasing, while consumption is increasing. Besides the above-mentioned problems with housing and food, clothing, which was not a problem in the mainland, has also become a major issue in Hong Kong. You may think you are embracing a "new life," "simplicity," and "virtue," but you are constantly ridiculed and despised. For the sake of work, you have to pretend and put on a show like everyone else. Unexpected blows that cannot be planned for or controlled are especially troublesome. Unaccustomed to the local climate, illness strikes. If one is the head of a family of three or five, their white hairs will certainly increase, and the wrinkles on their forehead will deepen, showing signs of aging.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is a transportation hub, and everyone is in the same boat. Helping relatives and friends in need, and the inevitable social obligations of welcoming and sending off, are also unavoidable. The burden of life weighs heavily on the whole body; the iron whip of life mercilessly lashes. How to live in Hong Kong?</p>
<p>According to our reporter, the employees of the Commercial Press recently sincerely requested improved treatment from the authorities. Since August 13, the Commercial Press's business volume has only been 60% of what it was before the war. Maintaining 100% of the expenses with 60% of the business volume naturally puts the authorities in a difficult situation. The salary reduction was not their wish. The austerity measures are as follows: Those earning under 30 dollars receive their full salary; those earning between 30 and 60 dollars receive 90%; those earning between 60 and 100 dollars receive 80%; those earning over 100 dollars receive 70%... and so on. This applies to the Shanghai headquarters, as well as the Chongqing and Hong Kong branches. Recently, due to the sharp increase in the cost of living in Shanghai and Chongqing, the Commercial Press authorities, understanding the hardship of their employees, have managed to increase salaries by 10% across the board, which is a temporary relief for the employees. In Hong Kong, a small number of employees earning less than 40 dollars have been given preferential treatment, and senior employees earning over 100 dollars have received a 20% increase. Some employees who have not received preferential treatment are now asking the authorities to treat everyone equally and improve their treatment. The general manager of the Press, Mr. Wang Yunwu, is capable and has agreed to find ways to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Our reporter cites the difficulties of the Commercial Press and the urgency of the employees' request for improved treatment to illustrate that if the Commercial Press is in this situation, the plight of other industries is self-evident. As for the vast unemployed population, their suffering is many times greater. We do not blame the war. We must thoroughly understand that all this suffering is bestowed upon us by the Japanese militarists.</p>
<p>Improving living conditions and labor-management coordination are urgent tasks. But what is the thorough and real solution? Victory in the War of Resistance and national liberation is our path.</p>

<h3>Shenzhen Casualties Lack Clothing and Bedding. Hoping Compatriots will Donate.</h3>
<p>Over a dozen wounded soldiers from our counterattacks in Shilong, Liaobu, and other places have arrived in Shenzhen for treatment. They are currently being cared for by the St. John Ambulance Brigade. However, due to financial constraints, the equipment in the hospital is not yet adequate. Items such as surgical beds, camp beds, and military blankets are lacking. Currently, the injured soldiers have only a thin military blanket for warmth. In this changeable weather, with injured bodies covered only by a meager military blanket, it is not enough to protect against the cold. The superintendent of the Brigade, Mr. Morris, hopes that people from all walks of life will generously donate the above items.</p>
<h3>At Time of British Military Reshuffle. Part of Hong Kong Garrison to Return to England. British War Office Revises Overseas Military Service Law. Service Period Reduced from Six to Four Years.</h3>
<p>A large part of the British defense forces in Hong Kong will leave Hong Kong and return to England during the next military reshuffle. This is due to the recent promulgation of the new overseas military service law by the British War Office. According to this law, the term of service for British troops stationed overseas has been reduced from six to four years. Soldiers who have served four years in overseas teams are eligible to return home. Many of the four battalions of British troops stationed in Hong Kong have served overseas for more than four years, so they will be transferred from Hong Kong and return home when the troop reshuffle begins. However, this new rule does not apply to officers of the British army stationed overseas. It is understood that the British War Office has prepared a plan to transfer overseas troops back to the country.</p>

Yesterday, the 21st, according to a quick report from the Southern Route Commissioner, the × army has recently increased its troops by 5,000, and more than 20 large and small × ships have been dispatched from Shanghai to the south, with the intention of rapidly occupying the entire line and the Southern Route. In recent days, many × ships and × planes have been constantly spying on the sea area around Leizhou Peninsula and Beihai, making the situation extremely tense. All the details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Continuing to Send Troops and Advance into Central Hainan</p>
<p>When we began our counterattack on Yueguan, the × army on Hainan Island, because the forces in Guangzhou were insufficient, transferred a part to join the northern Guangdong resistance against our large army heading south. Our guerrilla team learned of their concealment and immediately launched an offensive to curb the × army's attack, dealing a great blow to the × army and restoring Ding'an. After suffering the disaster, the × army believed that it was not enough to continue to go further to implement its plan of invading Qiong and entering Leizhou. Therefore, they sent another 5,000 reinforcements, who arrived in Chengmai, Yulin, Sanya, and other places yesterday. On the 15th and 16th, the × army sent a large number of planes from Wenchang Airport to bomb Leye, Jiaji, Wanning, and Hele City areas in the rain. Judging from their movements, they had the intention of continuing to advance into the interior of Hainan Island.</p>
<p>Southern Route is Tense and Leizhou is Evacuating</p>
<p>In addition to reinforcing 5,000 troops, the × army on Hainan Island also transferred more than 20 × ships from Shanghai to the south, which have arrived on Hainan Island one after another in recent days and are constantly traveling between the Qiongzhou Strait and the Tokyo Bay. Six or seven large and small × ships suddenly sailed to Beihai and patrolled the area, so the situation on the Southern Route suddenly became tense. Since the 16th, Leizhou Peninsula has also been in a state of emergency. ×Planes and ×ships have constantly been seen spying on Wushi and other coastal areas of Xuwen and Haikang. Suixi is under air raid alerts all day long. It has been discovered that the magistrates of Xuwen and Haikang counties have once advised the citizens of the counties to return to the counties and continue to do business as usual. However, given the severity of the situation, a second announcement was made yesterday to evacuate the citizens of the county. At the same time, relay posts and local patrol teams were established to be responsible for communication and intelligence work. For the convenience of transportation, bicycles owned by all citizens in the county will be requisitioned for use.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Bay is Crowded with Refugees</p>
<p>Also, due to the renewed tension on the Southern Route, the citizens of each county have withdrawn to the interior. Those who are wealthier or have relatives doing business in Guangzhou Bay have mostly fled to avoid the calamity. In recent days, refugees from Hepu, Fangcheng, Haikang, and Xuwen counties have arrived in an endless stream, making the situation very crowded. Because they could not bear the ravages of the ×cavalry, or feared that the ×cavalry would penetrate deeper and suffer harm, about three or four thousand people fled from the jurisdictions of Hainan to the Zhou Island. It was discovered that refugees fleeing from Hainan were very embarrassed, without belongings, and their situation was bleak. The Guangzhou Disaster Relief Association West Camp Branch has been arranging for accommodation and relief in recent days.</p>

<h3>Our Troops Bravely Battled Through Rain and Bloodshed to Reclaim Huicheng; Fierce Battle of Three Hours Led to Breach of City Walls; Enemies Collapsed and Fled, Abandoning Countless Supplies</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Express] Our troops stationed in the western and lower reaches, after withdrawing from Jiangmen and Xinhui, adopted a full-scale mobile warfare strategy to exhaust the enemy forces. Following two weeks of adjustments and replenishment, on the 19th, they unexpectedly launched a swift and decisive attack, catching the enemy off guard and swiftly assaulting Huicheng. This resulted in the annihilation of hundreds of enemy soldiers, marking a glorious second chapter in the resistance war in Xinhui. Our reinforcements arrived on the 18th, initiating a counter-offensive against the enemy. By the morning of the 19th, before dawn, amidst torrential rain and thunder, our troops, recognizing the opportune moment, ordered a full-scale general attack. Guerrilla units hiding in the mountains surrounding the city also responded internally. Despite the heavy rain and thunder, our troops displayed unwavering spirit, charging forward. Upon reaching the sand embankments, approximately 300 enemy soldiers resisted from inside the village碉樓. Our troops, with heightened morale, first surrounded and annihilated this enemy contingent, then continued their brave assault towards Huicheng. Fierce battles ensued at Wangyue Mountain and Dayun Mountain near the city. The enemy had set up eight or nine flat-trajectory artillery pieces at the Gangzhou and Ningyang road stations, along with over ten heavy machine guns, densely targeting the front lines of our advancing forces, posing a significant threat. In the midst of the intense struggle, fresh reinforcements from one of our units rushed to join the battle, further boosting morale. Braving rain and bloodshed, they advanced without retreat, wave upon wave. Commanders such as Liao, the chief of the 64th Army headquarters, Yang Jigan, the commander of a certain security regiment, and Li Wuzi and Zhou Hanling, the commanders of the Fourth District guerrilla forces, personally supervised the front lines, enduring the rain of arrows and stones. This enabled the officers and soldiers to fight with utmost dedication, united in purpose. After approximately three hours of fierce fighting, our troops successfully breached the city walls and engaged in street fighting.</p>
<p>The enemy's artillery lost its effectiveness. They resisted with machine guns, but our troops unleashed all their combat skills, employing broadswords and hand grenades in close-quarters combat, killing hundreds of enemy soldiers. The enemy then collapsed and fled. In this battle, our troops seized one artillery piece, several heavy machine guns, over twenty rifles, and countless supplies. Currently, only a remnant of the enemy is stubbornly resisting at Jiangzhou Station. Our troops have surrounded them on the 20th and will easily annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3>Enemy Invades Northward on Three Routes; Attack on Huaxian Repelled; Our Troops in Conghua and Huaxian Maintain Close Contact; Remnants Retreating Along the Congbai Branch Line</h3>
<p>[Wengyuan Express] On the southern front, our army's counter-offensive is progressing rapidly, especially on the northeast two routes. The main force of our Thirteenth Army Group has successively recovered major strongholds and is controlling Guangzhou. The war situation is improving daily. According to a statement released yesterday by the military authorities here, the situation on the northeast two routes in recent days is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Our Troops Launch Fierce Assault on Guotang and Jiangcun</p>
<p>Our Li Division, defending the Yuehan Railway, has achieved successive victories since receiving the order to counter-attack Guangzhou, first recovering Xinjie. The entire southern section of this route is now under our control. It was discovered that on the 18th and 19th, the enemy chieftain An suddenly dispatched over a thousand troops to advance north along the railway to reinforce, attempting to invade Xinjie. However, our troops detected the arrival of the enemy reinforcements and their establishment of a command post in Jiangcun in advance. In order to preemptively strike, they launched a swift and decisive assault on Guotang, Jiangcun, and other locations. Division Commander Li personally supervised the troops on the front lines, leading them in a charge against the enemy, resulting in numerous casualties. Currently, our forces have approached the Guotang, Jiangcun, and Gaotang areas.</p>
<p>Huang Liang Division Annihilates Over 200 Enemy Soldiers</p>
<p>As for the enemy forces stationed along the Congbai branch line of the Guanghua Highway, in the Taipingchang and Shenzui areas, after reinforcements of over 6,000 arrived yesterday, they launched an attack on Conghua and Paitan. However, they were repeatedly repelled by the Huang Shou and Liang Shiji divisions, making no progress. Despite repeated failures, the enemy's ambition to invade northward has not diminished. Yesterday, the 19th, the main force of the three-pronged northern offensive shifted its attack towards Huaxian. Simultaneously, they harassed Conghua along the Congbai branch line from Shengang, and attacked Shiqian from Guizui, intending to control the communication between Huaxian and Conghua. Currently, the enemy's main force is advancing from Taipingchang to Xiangshan to attack Huaxian. Our Peng Zhifang division, having made early preparations, launched a head-on counterattack and established close contact with the Huang Tao division to annihilate the enemy. Therefore, fierce fighting broke out along the way, resulting in a stalemate. In the end, the enemy was overwhelmed and fled towards the Congbai branch line. In this battle, the enemy suffered over 290 casualties, while our troops also suffered over 100 casualties.</p>
<h3>Enemy in Xijiang Shortens Defense Line; Construction of Fortifications Hastened in Jiangmen and Foshan; We Force Enemy in Guangzhou to Prepare for Retreat; Enemy in Jiujiang and Lianglong Retreats to Foshan</h3>
<p>[Nanhai Express] After our various army groups were ordered to launch a general counter-offensive, the vanguard troops have approached the suburbs of Guangzhou. As a result, the enemy forces in Guangdong and Foshan are extremely panicked. In recent days, they have been frequently dispatching large and small enemy warships, loading them with grain and supplies, and concentrating them at Humen in preparation for retreat in case our troops advance into Guangzhou. According to reports, the enemy forces stationed in Xijiang have also withdrawn from the Jiujiang, Lianglong, and Sinan areas to Foshan and surrounding villages, shortening the defense line in an attempt to hold out. Therefore, in recent days, from south of Foshan, along the Guangsan Line to Luocun, 700 to 800 enemy soldiers have been gathered, and they are urgently constructing defensive fortifications. The busyness of the situation has not been seen since the fall of Guangzhou. At the same time, they have dispatched over 100 engineers, forcibly conscripting over 200 strong men, to excavate numerous ant nest-style and I-shaped trenches in the highlands of Yuanshi, Shiwan, Shencun, Tantou, Zhangheng, Fengbu, Jiebian, and other villages adjacent to the Jiangfo Highway and the Guangsan Road. Their fear of our army's counter-offensive and the busyness of their preparations are evident.</p>
<h3>Ongoing Relief Efforts in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>— Microwave</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said: "Modern warfare is a final competition between nations in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial strength. The side with the economic and material ability to provide sustained supplies will achieve ultimate victory." When we read the above famous saying, we should know how important relief work is at present!</p>
<p>Wartime relief work is proactive, not passive; it is productive, not consumptive. We must strive for relief work, not only to help our compatriots with a compassionate heart that feels their suffering as our own, but also, from the standpoint of the nation, to maintain the source of sustained supply of our manpower, material resources, and financial strength, and to expedite the realization of ultimate victory.</p>
<p>In Guangdong, the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association shoulders this important mission. The predecessor of the Provincial Relief Association was the Refugee Relief Committee, which was reorganized on February 1 of this year in accordance with the orders of the Executive Yuan, and proceeded step by step in accordance with Chairman Li's relief program.</p>
<p>In just two months, the Relief Association has already done a great deal of work, such as organizing relief teams to work in the war zones, sending special commissioners to investigate refugees in various places, distributing cotton vests to refugee populations through county associations, allocating relief funds to county associations to handle relief work, and investigating orphans in various counties. Holding orphan education groups, setting up refugee reclamation areas, and holding seed farming cattle farm implements and other loans,</p>
<p>According to the latest report of the Provincial Relief Work Report, (1) Regarding the organization of relief teams to work in the war zones, more than 100 graduates from the Fourth Route Army Headquarters Rescue Training Class were reorganized into a relief team directly under the association, which was divided into ten teams to be stationed in the war zones to carry out relief work. The team has now been transferred back from Lianxian and will be dispatched separately in the near future. (2) Regarding the dispatch of special commissioners to investigate refugees in various places, the province has been invaded by invaders since ××, and the people in the war zones and counties near the war zones have been displaced. In order to understand the situation of refugee population in various places and prepare for practical relief, the association has specially dispatched special commissioners to various counties and refugee shelters in Hong Kong and Macao for investigation, in order to implement them and send personnel and rescue teams at any time, carrying the necessary supplies, and distribute them separately, so as to benefit the people. (3) Regarding the distribution of cotton vests to county associations to distribute them to refugees, the refugees escaped from their homes, and it is inevitable that they will freeze in the cold weather. The association has specially prepared 30,000 cotton vests and distributed them to various counties to distribute them to refugees to keep them warm. (4) Regarding the allocation of relief funds to county associations to handle relief work, the counties in the province that are close to the war zone are often harassed by people, and even cities that are far away are often bombed by machines. The association understands the severity of the disasters in various places, and allocates relief funds to the county associations to order them to handle emergency relief, and store a part for emergency needs. (5) Regarding the investigation of orphans in various counties and the establishment of orphan education groups, it has been found that there are a large number of orphans in various places. It is important to find ways to accommodate them. After accommodation, if they lack education, their knowledge will become lower and lower, and the country and the nation will suffer. The association has now issued orders to various parties to investigate the actual number in order to hold orphan education groups. (6) Regarding the establishment of refugee reclamation areas, it has been found that providing refugees with food and clothing is a temporary solution, because food and clothing can only be provided for a while, but cannot help them permanently. Therefore, how to enable refugees to permanently solve the problems of food, clothing, housing, etc., it is necessary to find ways to make them have skills. Our country is based on agriculture, and barren land is everywhere. It is now planned to set up refugee reclamation areas in Nanshan, Lianshan, Xinxing, and Shiwan Dashan. (7) Regarding the holding of seed farming cattle farm implements and other loans, it has been found that farmers in the war zones and nearby counties have been ravaged by violence, resulting in a lack of seeds, farming cattle, farm implements, and other items, making it impossible to engage in farming. The association has now consulted with various provincial departments and bureaus to handle this loan in order to provide relief, in order to achieve the goal of "paying attention to the temporary measures and planning for the permanent solutions", the Provincial Relief Association's plan for disaster relief can be divided into (1) negative relief, (2) active relief in two parts, in the second part, it can be said to be the productive part, the establishment of refugee factories, the establishment of refugee resettlement areas are the most urgent and most difficult work, the need for refugee factories, Needless to say, we all know that we are now planning to explore the eastern and western regions of the province, where there are more refugees and safer locations, and first set up ten factories for weaving, wool, socks, cotton clothes, cloth shoes, straw shoes, sacks, manufacturing, carpentry, and iron work, with a total of 70 factories, which can accommodate more than 22,000 refugees, with a total cost of more than 1.02 million yuan, As for resettlement, it is planned to choose Nanshan in the eastern region, Yunshan in the northern region, and Xinxing in the western region as resettlement areas, which can resettle about 12,000 refugee households, with an average of five people per household, or about 60,000 people, each household can cultivate about 20 mu of land according to their farming ability, and 12,000 households can cultivate a total of 440,000 mu of land, requiring a total of 4.62 million yuan,</p>
<p>Regarding the rescue of orphans in the war zones, the Provincial Women's Work Association is responsible for more responsibility, and has been promoted by all parties, and now the Provincial Relief Association has sent a relief team, carrying relief funds and donations, and together with the Women's Work Association's rescue team for orphans to Qingyuan, Huaxian, Fogang, Sihui, and other counties to pick up orphans. The two teams have set off on the 14th, and the remaining eight teams will set off one after another. Each team has more than a dozen staff members, totaling more than 100 people, with their spirit and strength, to do this kind of sacrifice work, I think, will definitely be able to get a good result, the reporter sincerely, success labor,</p>

<h3>The Bloody and Tearful Words of Northeast Film Merchants</h3>
<p>— Ren Xin</p>
<p>The Current Situation of the Film Industry in Pseudo "Manchukuo" Under the Iron Heel</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Northeast and the emergence of the puppet regime, which transformed into the pseudo "Manchukuo," the people have been living a miserable and inhuman life under oppression. All industries, especially the film industry, which belongs to the cultural sector, have been subjected to intensified oppression and deprivation of benefits, sparing no effort, and treating them like cattle and horses. Recently, a Shanghai-based film merchant spoke about the situation there, with tears streaming down his face. Here, I will give a brief account of it to show the true situation of the dark and hopeless Northeast film industry.</p>
<p>Film Censorship in Pseudo "Manchukuo"</p>
<p>Under the command of Japanese advisors, film censorship was initially very chaotic, with each province and region conducting inspections randomly and independently. Therefore, likes and dislikes were arbitrary and without clear standards. Sometimes, films that had been screened in one place were often banned in another. Films that had been severely censored in one place were screened unchanged in another. Film merchants were often driven to despair by such inexplicable censorship incidents, and their suffering was indescribable. In July 1934, the so-called "Eastern Film Censorship Unification Policy" was promulgated, and the actual handling of the affairs was changed to the "Police Department of the Civil Affairs Department" of the pseudo "Manchukuo." From that time on, film censorship was considered to be "unified."</p>
<p>Japanization of Films Japanese films also need to be reviewed before being screened in the pseudo "Manchukuo," but this is only a formality. In fact, films that can be publicly screened in Japan will never be subjected to any difficulties in the pseudo "Manchukuo." Some of their Japanization films, wearing the mask of "East Asian Peace," often receive awards from the "Civil Affairs Department." However, some Japanese films are only shown for their own enjoyment.</p>
<p>Terrible Exploitation Not long ago, a so-called "Film Administration Bureau" was established to manage all film administration within the pseudo "Manchukuo." Like other institutions, it is nominally headed by a pseudo "official," but the actual power is in the hands of Japanese advisors. The "Administration Bureau" implements strict control over films. All imported films must be handed over to it for management, and business must also be controlled by them. All business income is divided between the "Administration Bureau" and the film owner in a 40-60 split—the "Administration Bureau" takes 40%, and the film owner gets 60%. Such exploitative means are even more tyrannical and unreasonable. The price of domestic films for Northeast screening rights, including all expenses, is about 4,000 yuan per film. Therefore, the business income of each film must exceed 7,000 yuan to break even. The interests of film merchants have been robbed, and they are no different from being treated as cattle and horses for them.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Domestic Films As for domestic films screened in the pseudo "Manchukuo," they are mostly old films with pure entertainment value from a few years ago. Any domestic film with a little national consciousness and ideas of the times will never be screened there. The pseudo "Manchukuo" authorities are extremely strict in banning such films, and film merchants dare not lightly take the risk of doing such business that could lead to death.</p>
<p>Finally, according to his report, he had long given up on this kind of cattle and horse life. In the past, it was necessary for the sake of life, forced by helplessness, but in his own conscience, he could not help but feel ashamed. He felt very uneasy, receiving intangible condemnation. In short, people who have not personally experienced the inhuman life in this dark circle do not know how miserable it is.</p>
<h3>Hollywood's Great Director Lineup, Continued</h3>
<p>(15) Henry Koster He was originally a famous European director and joined Universal Pictures a few years ago. Under his direction, he has truly revealed the beauty of many women, such as Deanna Durbin in "One Hundred Men and a Girl" and "Mad About Music," or Danielle Darrieux in "The Rage of Paris."</p>
<p>(16) Gregory La Cava He is also one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. Just think of Carole Lombard's "My Man Godfrey" and Claudette Colbert's "The Gilded Lily" are so lighthearted and humorous, while Katharine Hepburn's "Stage Door" and Colbert's "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife" are so sad and charming.</p>
<p>(17) Robert Z. Leonard He is a major director at MGM. In recent years, his famous films include "The Divorcee," "The Great Ziegfeld," and "Maytime." However, since "When Ladies Meet," it has been nearly half a year, and there has been no new work.</p>

<h3>Football League Finale: South China vs. Navy for the Championship - Today at 4:45 PM at the Navy Field - Middlesex vs. 5th Battalion Artillery for the Second Division Runner-Up Final at So Kon Po Field</h3>
<p>(Our Special Dispatch) The championship match of the First Division Football League, postponed from last Saturday and Sunday due to rain, will finally be staged at the Navy Field on the waterfront of Causeway Bay at 4:45 PM today, if the weather permits and there are no further delays.</p>
<p>There is also the Second Division League runner-up battle, which is also scheduled to take place at So Kon Po Field at 4:30 PM today.</p>
<p>The long-standing rivalry between South China and the Navy, since entering the second round of the league, their scores have been very close, and their performances have fluctuated, which has made the championship trend a mystery with many changes in the competition, finally leading to this decisive championship encounter.</p>
<p>At this final moment, the stakes are extremely high. Therefore, last Saturday, I said, "South China must win. If they win, it will have three meanings. The first is to win the league championship, take back South China's glorious position from last year, and not allow others to covet it. The second is that if they can beat the Navy this time, they can also be sure of victory in the third match against the [Asahi Cup], because this match is a touchstone for the Asahi Cup, and the possibility of winning all six major championships will become more stable due to this victory. The third point is that when South China was previously hindered by the police, coincidentally, Eastern also defeated the Navy, so South China was able to maintain its detached position. But they must remember the indirect help from Eastern and should repay the favor by helping them succeed. Therefore, it is best to take this opportunity to defeat the Navy. If they do so, they can not only win their own glory but also find a way out for Eastern, because if the Navy loses, their scores will be the same as Eastern, and they will need to have another runner-up final. Then, Eastern may also defeat the Navy and jump to second place."</p>
<p>The success or failure of both sides hangs in the balance. Under this encounter, they will fight to the death. However, South China has one more point, so their position is better. Even if they don't win and only draw, they can still be the champion. However, Eastern must hope that the Navy loses to have a chance to compete for the runner-up. Therefore, relying on others to succeed is inevitably selfish, and their hope that South China will win is also extremely earnest.</p>
<p>With warships coming and going unpredictably, the Navy's players are often different. This championship battle has been postponed for a week, which is quite beneficial to the Navy, because another warship arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday, bringing many strong players. Therefore, how much the lineup for today's battle will change from the one scheduled for last Saturday and Sunday is particularly noteworthy. The right inside forward position is once again held by Zhong Shi. This fellow has good skills. I saw his performance in the first match of last year's Asahi Cup. It was indeed extraordinary. He is good at shooting, charging, and dribbling. I advise South China's defenders to be very careful. However, there are many famous foreign players. I don't know if this Zhong Shi is one of them. If he really is, it is indeed a cause for concern. Don't take him lightly.</p>
<p>In last Saturday and Sunday's military roster, Morris was set to play center forward, but today he has been transferred to the left wing, and a Kim Pilo, whose name is unfamiliar, has been replaced as the center forward. Based on this, Kim Pilo's skills must be very high, otherwise, they would not make such a move. Gao Lusi, who was originally set to play left wing, has retreated to left midfielder, which shows that he is also a strong player who is good at both offense and defense.</p>
<p>The goalkeeper is also not [Bin Sun], but [Dejia Chen]. It is said that his skills are no less than those of [Mai Jialishi Da]. In short, the Navy's lineup is definitely more complete than the one set for last Saturday. I hope all the players of South China will be alert and strive for the final victory.</p>
<p>Mai Shaohan of South China has an inflammation in his foot injury, so he cannot contribute to this important match, which has a significant impact. Fortunately, Ye Beihua has returned to the battlefield in the forward line, so Guo Yingqi can be transferred to midfielder. The lineup is still decent.</p>
<p>Beihua is a hero of South China's revival and cooperates very well with Feng Jingxiang. Although he is older and moves slower, he has enough experience and is much better than using Li Enliang. However, one thing is that Beihua, Jingxiang, and Li Zhaorong all have the same style, so I am afraid that they will focus too much on the triangular short passing attack method, which will be counterproductive. It is best to attack both long and short, and act according to the situation. Don't "put all your eggs in one basket" and only advance with short passes in the middle. The wings should be used more. If they can attack from all sides, that is the best strategy.</p>
<p>The Navy is strong and ambitious, so it is uncertain who will win. South China must work hard to avoid losing all their previous efforts. Then, the great championship will naturally be in their hands. The two lineups are as follows (Tai Sui):</p>
<p>(South China)</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Guo Yingqi, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai, Luo Douwen, Ye Beihua, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>(Navy Team)</p>
<p>[Dejia Chen], [Ge Chen], [Xuan Di], [Lian Gao Lusi], [Ta Neng], [Han Niwei Lu Yan], Morris, [Tuo Ban], Kim Pilo, Zhong Shi, [Shi Delang]</p>
<p>Match Schedule</p>
<p>Today's First Division League: 4:45 PM, South China vs. Navy, Navy Field. Second Division Runner-up Final: 4:30 PM, Middlesex vs. 5th Battalion Artillery, So Kon Po Field.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's First Division Exhibition Match: 4:30 PM, South China/Navy vs. Interport Team, Caroline Hill.</p>
<p>Second Division Exhibition Match: 3:00 PM, South China Club vs. Combined Team, Caroline Hill.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Basketball - All Second Division Matches - Free Admission</h3>
<p>The public men's basketball game originally had two Second Division games and one First Division game tonight. However, the First Division match between Hong Kong University and Pui Ying has been canceled because Hong Kong University is in the exam period, and this game is their last match, so the outcome is not important. Therefore, there will be three Second Division games. At 6:30 PM, Wah Hung vs. [Qing Zhi], at 7:30 PM, South China vs. [Qing Zhi], and at 8:30 PM, [Qing Dui] vs. Li Hang. Judging from the strength of each team, Wah Hung's aggressiveness is stronger than [Qing Zhi], so they have a chance to win. South China is very strong, so [Qing Zhi] should not be their opponent. Li Hang is one of the strongest teams, so [Qing Dui] will definitely fail tonight. All matches tonight are open to the public, and admission is free.</p>

<h3>How to Practice Freestyle Swimming</h3>
<p>— Pan Congshao</p>
<p>Regarding freestyle swimming practice, I will divide it into two parts: learning and training. For the former, I hope to provide a quick and correct path to learning. To achieve the effectiveness of freestyle swimming techniques, one must also pay attention to the way of training.</p>
<p>There is more than one type of swimming style. I have already listed them in the previous issue. Which one should beginners start with? This is a question that most learners cannot follow the right track. We engage in swimming, which can not only acquire a skill to protect ourselves but also improve our health and bring us great physical and mental pleasure. To achieve these goals at the same time, there are many conditions. It is essential to learn freestyle swimming first because its movements are the most agile, so it is the most useful. However, the hardship of learning it is not easy to overcome. Learners often give up and turn to other things, revealing their weakness of being afraid of labor and seeking comfort, let alone using swimming as a method to strengthen their physique.</p>
<p>The movement of freestyle swimming is like this: the limbs form a straight line, the lower limbs continuously move up and down, and the upper limbs also alternately and tirelessly insert into the water from in front of the head and push backward. This movement can generate buoyancy and propulsion. As for breathing, it must be coordinated with the movement of freestyle swimming to be achieved. Learning to swim on land seems like a joke, but it is actually very necessary. It can not only provide more opportunities to practice the movements of swimming but also easily correct erroneous movements. Even those who want to continuously improve their swimming skills cannot ignore this step.</p>
<p>Before getting into the water, the first thing to learn is the floating movement. Don't be afraid of water, and don't be afraid of the water splashing into your eyes. Extend your limbs forward and backward, making them straight, and your head and body will be like a straight line. Let it float in the water, and develop confidence in your ability to float in the water. (1)</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Chinese Athletic Association Elected New Officers - A Strong Debate Arose over the Issue of Guanghua's Attendance</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Athletic Association held its annual meeting at the Chinese Restaurant at 6:00 PM yesterday, electing officers for the current term. More than 50 representatives from the Chinese Swimming Association, the Chinese [Yue Le] Association, the Mini Ball Association, the Taikoo Chinese Athletic Association, the Eastern Athletic Association, the Guanghua Athletic Association, the Kitchee Athletic Association, the South China Athletic Association, the Chinese Youth Association, the [Zhong Sheng] Society, and the Mini Ball League attended. After the chairman of the previous term, Zhang Minquan, announced the meeting, a fierce debate arose over the issue of the eligibility of the Guanghua Athletic Association representatives to attend this meeting. At about 8:00 PM, the issue had not been resolved. As a result, the chairman temporarily announced that the Guanghua Association was approved as a member and had the right to attend. Zhang Minquan then left the meeting, and Cheng Kun was publicly elected as the temporary chairman to carry out the election work (list recorded later). The position of deputy director of each department was reserved for the director of that department to appoint himself. The government auditor will also be appointed by the officers of the current term. After the election was completed, Mo Qing, the chairman of the current term, presided over the meeting and changed the name of the committee to chairman. The meeting was then adjourned. The list of officers of the association for the current term is as follows: Chairman: Mo Qing; Vice Chairman: Xie Yuchuan; Treasurer: Chen Ziqing; General Secretary: Li Huitang; Director of Football Department: Lin Zhonghao; Director of Swimming Department: He Jingbo; Director of Basketball Department: [Dian Lian]; Director of Track and Field Department: Lin Zhaohua; Director of Volleyball Department: Guo Mukai; Director of Tennis Department: Li Weicai; Director of Water Polo Department: He Shaoan; Director of Table Tennis Department: Yang Zixiang; Auditor: Ruan Youjin; Secretary: Lu Xiapfu.</p>

<h3>The World of Gold</h3>
<p>Since the world's military buildup and active preparations for war, gold has become an object of universal hoarding by officials and civilians in various countries. Although gold cannot satisfy hunger or ward off the cold, and currency scholars generally believe that it will eventually be demoted from its status in the currency system, under the current capitalist world, it has not yet lost its so-called "gold is omnipotent" qualification. Therefore, national governments hoard it to maintain their foreign exchange and settle the price of their imported arms, while the people fear the devaluation of paper money in wartime, so they hoard it to preserve their wealth. Therefore, in recent years, the amount of gold held by various countries' currencies has increased sharply, but it has not kept pace with the increase in the world's gold production. In recent years, the world's gold production has increased by an average of 1,100 metric tons per year, so from 1933 to 1938, it has increased by as much as 6,600 metric tons. However, the amount of monetary gold held by various countries in the same period has only increased by 4,000 metric tons. It can be seen that in the last six years, the amount of gold hoarded by the people has increased by another 2,600 metric tons.</p>
<p>According to the recent issue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin magazine, at the end of 1933, the total value of the world's monetary gold was 13,826 million old US dollars, which increased sharply year by year, reaching 21,367 million old US dollars at the end of September last year. However, Japan has sharply reduced from 2,120 million old US dollars to 970 million old US dollars (this number is still based on Japanese official reports, and in reality, it has entered an era of no reserves). China, on the other hand, has sharply increased from 5 million old US dollars to 9 million old US dollars (this number does not include its stored gold). It is especially noteworthy that Japan's monetary gold reserves were 2,730 million old US dollars at the end of 1936, reduced to 1,540 million at the end of 1937, and further reduced to 970 million old US dollars in September 1938. In other words, in the first nine months of last year, it sharply reduced by 570 million old US dollars. Moreover, since the outbreak of the August 13th war last autumn, Japan has repeatedly exported domestic stored gold, even revaluing the reserve price to facilitate exports. Now, it is even publicly exporting part of its last reserves. However, during the same period, the Chinese government's gold reserves increased from 5 million old US dollars to 9 million old US dollars, which remained unchanged until the end of September last year. In contrast, Japan's weakness is obvious. Moreover, according to the latest estimates from all parties, the amount of silver stored in our country, even at present, is still as high as 900 million to 1 billion yuan, which is not included in the above numbers. The magazine's estimated numbers are listed as follows (unit: million old US dollars; X is an approximate number): Current Amount of Monetary Gold Held by Governments of Various Countries (Including All Legal Reserves)</p>

<h3>Following the Premier</h3>
<p>— Ji Zi</p>
<p>In one of Ba Jin’s novels, he depicted a philistine who mingled in the revolutionary ranks, and would frequently boast to others, "The Premier patted me on the shoulder and said..." as if he were extremely honored. In his mind, he always thought he had supported the revolution long ago, was a faithful follower of the Premier, and was now at least a revolutionary veteran. This typical character from the novel actually exists everywhere in today's great era of resistance, from local tyrants and evil gentry to profiteers of national crisis and traitorous figures acting as collaborators; they are all present. Their mistakes are even greater than those of the philistine brother who was "patted on the shoulder by the Premier." When their masks are about to be torn off, they like to use "following the Premier for decades" to cover up themselves, use revolution as a facade, and use the Premier as a protective charm and shield. In favorable situations, they will go a step further, using the law to eliminate those who attack them. Didn't someone in Guangzhou sue the Yuehua newspaper, demanding compensation for reputation damage and closure of the newspaper? Later, when Guangzhou fell, he actually became a traitor, and everyone sighed at how convincingly the hypocrite had played his role. In fact, during the lawsuit, when right and wrong were unclear, didn't he use following the Premier as a shield? Cowardly hypocrites are accustomed to using the "attack as defense" strategy. Until the minute before the truth is exposed, they still use the great Premier to suppress others and elevate themselves. When everything is decided, they reveal their tails and shamelessly follow the "Imperial Army." In fact, the Premier traveled and worked for the revolution for many years and naturally knew many people. There were indeed those who worked hard for the revolution, supported, and followed him. However, if the Premier happened to have a meal at someone's house or stayed overnight, we cannot say that someone followed him or was a revolutionary veteran, not to mention that there were many who fell behind or defected during the revolutionary process. In "Thirteen Warriors of the Red Army," wasn't one soldier initially following the Red Army captain, fighting the enemy, and working hard to kill the enemy? In the end, he couldn't endure the pain of the revolutionary process and finally defected, throwing himself into the arms of the enemy, and was eventually painfully eliminated by his loyal and persistent comrades. This, although a scene from a movie promoting revolutionary history, can also be used to answer the fallacy of "following the Premier."</p>
<p>During the Russian Revolution, everyone in the country knew the name of Gorky. At that time, people often took advantage of society's respect for Gorky to do evil. For example, when a petty thief was arrested, he would plead, "For Gorky's sake, forgive me this once!" Today, those who use "following the Premier" as a facade, no matter how clever their methods, are still inevitably adopting the same style as the petty thief.</p>
<p>In fact, in turbulent times, how many are truly loyal revolutionary comrades, and how many have "followed" for decades? The Premier himself cannot remember clearly, not to mention that the Premier is no longer alive, and there are many forgeries. I think: these people who consider themselves loyal comrades should no longer use the same thing as a shield. Knowing that you also borrow it, and I also borrow it, the value of the facade will decrease, and one day, this facade will become a 1918 German mark.</p>
<p>Under the banner of resistance, past accounts should not be settled. No matter if you have been a puppet or a puppet soldier, as long as you defect today and follow "resistance," you will be remembered forever and benefit your descendants greatly. Conversely, even if you were a president in the past, assassinated a Manchu prince, followed the Premier for many years, and wrote the Premier's will, once you shamelessly throw yourself into the enemy's arms, your glorious history will disappear without a trace.</p>

<p>— Jie Yang</p>
<p>The entire town was shrouded in a gloomy sky. The bone-chilling wind patrolled the corridor-like streets, making it appear especially desolate and bleak.</p>
<p>In the town river, unusual waves surged. From the east and west ports, groups of boats brought nearly a hundred young people. From the wide-brimmed felt hats, one could tell they were the renowned "fighters" from the shores of Cheng Lake.</p>
<p>A sturdy young man was the first to jump ashore, holding high the iron hoe in his hand, and shouted loudly at the group standing on the boat: "Keep your tools handy! Today, let's show them whether we are fighters or not, understand?" With a wave of his hand, the group on the boat surged ashore.</p>
<p>Holding hoes, flat poles, iron rulers...they rushed like a tide towards the west end of the town, to the front of the "District Office." The sturdy young man raised the wooden plaque with "Land Tax Collection Office" written on it and slammed it hard at the puppet police standing by the door. "Damn you, today we're here to settle the grain tax!"</p>
<p>They went straight inside, up the stairs. Only the money accountant, known as an evil litigator, was there. Without saying a word, they swarmed him, punching and kicking him before throwing him out of the window.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaotic sounds of destruction, a cry arose, "To the 'Alone Mistake Director's' house — go…to…go…"</p>
<p>Like a tide, they rushed to the corner to the dye shop, which was the home of "Branch Chairman and 'Tax Collection Director,'" Ma the One-Eyed.</p>
<p>However, they searched the house and could not find that bastard One-Eyed Dragon.</p>
<p>"Okay, we should burn the traitor's furniture to feel good," the sturdy young man said, carrying two chairs, "Move it, everyone move it! Move it to the temple grounds to burn!"</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred people acted together, emptying the house in an instant. On the temple grounds, everything was piled up like a mountain — tables, benches, clothes, even the cloths soaking in the dye vats were fished out and piled on top.</p>
<p>The crowd filled the temple grounds to overflowing. They clapped and cheered when the fiery flames roared.</p>
<p>The town, which had seemed dead, was filled with hot vitality.</p>
<h3>Hypocrisy</h3>
<p>— Run Gui</p>
<p>This is a mystery, let it swirl in my brain!</p>
<p>When I can't get an answer to what I should answer, I comfort myself: human hypocrisy is inherited from the most distant ancestors, it shouldn't have any effect, any attempt, so those with this kind of situation are all humans who are too good at using their nature, so I despise humans, and of course, I despise myself!</p>
<p>In childhood, one would occasionally discover the deception and hypocrisy of relatives, but because I didn't know much at the time, I took it as the natural law of elders, or an attitude toward life, so I didn't care at all. Turning my back, I would use my mind to kick a small leather ball, or play marbles. When I entered school, I saw this kind of situation more often, such as when students were caught cheating by teachers, they would definitely insist that they hadn't cheated. They especially liked to boast and brag in front of girls, even though they themselves knew that the other party only treated their words like a gust of wind blowing past their ears. Later, when I entered society, I saw even more shocking and appalling deceptions of all kinds, but my heart felt even more bewildered, and lost, and at the same time, I despised humans even more.</p>
<p>Human hypocrisy is always trying every possible means: some use hypocrisy to try to cheat for some benefits, and some have to be hypocritical for some things, as if without hypocrisy, standing in society would be like standing on one leg, without any support, not standing steadily. No matter how good your talent and skill are, you can only drift in the void, and if you are not careful, you will end up with a body full of wounds on the ground. Conversely, if you can be flexible and hypocritical, at least you won't be a poor scholar starving and crying with a long face, begging people to "do a good deed!" In short: hypocrisy teaches you how to deal with the world, how to survive.</p>
<p>This kind of meaning seems to be close to being a worshiper of the "only hypocrisy" doctrine. But although I don't advocate this, some facts are placed before my eyes, and I can't help but feel this way. You see, in today's society, whoever wants to survive, whoever wants to show off, has to be hypocritical, and has to use hypocrisy in a distorted way. So who can only be given a portion to be scolded and despised forever! The formation of hypocrisy as hypocrisy, in this way, shouldn't be accidental.</p>
<h3>Cultural Merchants and Cultural Figures</h3>
<p>— Chi Huai</p>
<p>The legacy is a capitalist society. The characteristic of this society is the commodification of everything. The posture of cultural figures, no matter what the will of culture itself is, still cannot escape appearing in a commodified posture. Although engaging in culture now is a kind of suffering, it is a historically destined undertaking, which cannot be escaped by individual strength.</p>
<p>However, according to the principle of "fair" transaction in capitalism, a seller and a buyer of a commodity are each standing on an "equal" footing, and each conducts transactions according to the so-called "free will." The seller can bargain, and the buyer can counter-offer, even if this is a form of pseudo-freedom.</p>
<p>But only the "trade" between cultural figures and cultural merchants is an exception. Except for the works of a few famous writers that have a fixed price (and this is determined by the buyer in light of the seller's reputation, rather than the seller self-determining the price), it is rare to see a writer price their products for sale. This is because writers only pay attention to their works and don't pay much attention to the price they should get for their works. He cannot estimate the "production cost" — cost — of his product like other commodities. He submits the manuscript to the publishing world or other publishers, and the buyer unilaterally calculates the so-called manuscript fee of so much money per thousand words. For a writer, being particular about how much money is considered a kind of shame. This concept has become a general psychological state of writers throughout history.</p>
<p>The working purpose of cultural figures is mainly to promote the upward progress of society, so they don't take money as the goal. In terms of the advantages of cultural figures, in addition to obtaining a part of the money necessary for life, they also obtain a certain degree of social status. But in the current social situation, this certain degree of status often sacrifices their minimum necessary life. Therefore, we see the pale and emaciated faces of general writers, a poor scholar's shabby appearance. Regarding the miserable lives of general writers, there are many writers who died in poverty as proof, so I don't want to say more here.</p>
<p>If the miserable lives of general writers are indeed entirely dedicated to the progress of society, then I dare to say on behalf of every writer that they are willing. But the facts tell us otherwise. Those who engage in culture, like many other laborers, are exploited and squeezed by a small group of people. This group of people is the cultural merchants. They exploit the cultural laborers by means that are beyond the exploitation of ordinary laborers, taking advantage of the weakness of writers being ashamed to argue about monetary rewards. This was a fact before the War of Resistance, and it is especially an ironclad fact in today's War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Perhaps many of the readers admire the life of writers, but what you imagine in your mind is only the life of a few writers with special status, or the life of a writer in the American-style savage head legend. As for the current living conditions of general writers, only those who live such a real life can appreciate the taste. Although the taste is definitely not a Peach Blossom Spring, it is still the same and cannot be described to outsiders.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the remuneration of cultural workers today, because there is no way to talk about it. We also want to ask whether their work has any reward. Yes, I dare not say that there is no reward at all. But before a writer can get the reward he deserves for his work, he must first learn a philistine face. It cannot be said that there are no writers with this ability at all, but they are absolutely in the minority.</p>
<p>Therefore, cultural merchants who are parasitic on the labor of cultural figures can always enjoy their licentious lives in brothels and dance halls. Anyway, there is a large reserve army of unemployed cultural workers, so they don't have to worry that the writers will all die.</p>
<p>In order to avoid provocations from traitors and Trotskyites, we are unwilling to specifically point out how cultural merchants are exploiting writers' careers today. We abide by the state's labor-capital cooperation laws, and we do not want to create disputes that provide enemies with excuses for alienation. We even more don't want to demand a higher standard of living for cultural figures in this difficult period for the entire country — although we support improving the living standards of the general people. But we demand a minimum standard of living. We believe that cultural work is a powerful team to assist in the victory of the War of Resistance. We cannot allow the unlimited exploitation of cultural merchants! Not paying manuscript fees, swallowing royalties, printing works by original authors far away in the mainland, etc. This is equivalent to the behavior of bandits! At the very least, moral sanctions should be imposed.</p>
<h3>Inkstone (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Dong Fang</p>
<p>Regarding the madman, I have heard a little about him. He is not only a family friend, but also a classmate from childhood. However, because we had very few opportunities to meet, we gradually became estranged from each other. How many of our childhood classmates have become so unfamiliar to each other? I heard that he has experienced a lot of suffering, and his nerves have been affected. What he thinks in his heart, he has to say out loud. People secretly call him a madman. This time, in the flames of war, he has suffered even more intense stimulation and has become even more unpredictable in his laughter and tears. The children all love to tease him, asking him to sing the song of beating the Japanese devils. Before he finishes singing, tears stream down. After he finishes singing, he laughs loudly again. This is a person whose heart is completely broken, so he is called a madman.</p>
<p>He didn't want me to answer, and continued on his own, bringing his nose close to the inkstone and sniffing it:</p>
<p>"This inkstone is stained with the indelible stench of blood, also to leave a glimmer of righteousness for our descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Good young lady, you are truly my daughter. You will not grow strong, you will not be afraid of death, you will give your life in danger, you will not disgrace your pure body, you will grab this inkstone and smash the heads of the bandits! Good young lady. Our ancestors, their spirits are not far away, they are all attached to this inkstone, helping you to kill the bandits! It's a pity that this strike wasn't heavy enough, and didn't kill that beast, but instead he pulled out his gun, ah ah! You ultimately suffered! There are so many hateful things! I, as your dad, cannot protect you. I didn't hide you in advance, I didn't take you to escape. They all used big boats to carry their furniture to the countryside. I didn't think of this! I am worse than a dog, they dragged me here and there, sweeping horse manure and carrying wooden boards, and I was also scolded by them! I couldn't break the wooden boards over their heads, I didn't have the courage. I still wanted to live, I still wanted to come back, and escape to the countryside with you. When I came back, Grandma Hong told you the story, ah, this inkstone is still stained with the stench of blood!"</p>
<p>This is not human speech, this is simply a wounded beast roaring and wailing. His gloomy gaze pierced my heart like a sharp blade, and I had nothing to say.</p>
<p>"Now, the war is not being fought, the county magistrate is also here, the shops are open, and everyone is living their lives happily again. Humph, you can have your fun. I can't wait to pick up the inkstone and smash each of your heads! Humph: hum...Seize the golden plaque and storm the general's gate ——"</p>
<p>He raised the inkstone, stood up, and waved it in the air, striding forward, dancing all the way out. I looked at his back, and my heart ached. This back is so thin now. I remembered when we were in the same class, playing games, throwing leather balls, he was always so strong, how majestic he was like a big rooster. Who knew that time would grind him into this state!</p>
<p>The child tugged at my hand and said:</p>
<p>"Dad, are you also crazy?"</p>
<p>I nodded and said:</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm going crazy!"</p>
<p>(The End)</p>
<h3>Manchuria's Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"I can't find you anywhere! Don't you know that your family is looking for that place where you are?"</p>
<p>She only heard the sound, but couldn't see anyone. As she was peering around, she suddenly saw a black bear. She was so startled that tears wouldn't flow from her crying, and she retreated in panic. But the black bear didn't hurt her, and told her:</p>
<p>"Come to my cave!"</p>
<p>"I won't go."</p>
<p>It wasn't a black bear, but a ghost, forcing her to go. She refused, hitting the devil. At this moment, she suddenly woke up. She stared blankly at her surroundings. It wasn't a snowy field, but snow-colored bedding. She touched her cheeks and chest, which still hurt from being hit by her own fists. She jumped out of bed, searching for something outside. She didn't need anything inside the house. What she needed was a door that she could freely enter and exit. Or even a small hole to crawl through freely, to let her go to a free place. She was finally disappointed, and cried again.</p>
<p>As a result, she was still in this room of enticing nightmares, spending her strange first night.</p>
<p>The snow outside the window was hitting the glass like grains of sand, making a noise incessantly. It was very much like being on a small island at sea, listening to the murmuring sound left by the ebb and flow of the tide surging to and from the beach, disturbing the listener's peace. Yes, the clouds in Manchuria are disturbing to sleep. (44)</p>
