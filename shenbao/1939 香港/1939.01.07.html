<h3 id="c5">談談汽車運輸事業 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 丁祖澤</p>
<p>美國汽車運輸事業自創始迄今、已屆二十年、雖較其辦事業之歷史為短、然其發展之　、有超越其他運輸事業而居領袖之地位、現今美國全國運輸汽車之總數、據可靠之估計、已進五十六萬八千輛之巨數、雇工數約一百萬人、較美國鐵路運輸工人猶多、可見此事業之龐大矣、</p>
<p>汽車運輸事業可分為長途與短途二種、長途之距離有達七百英里者、在美國西部有數路在一千英里左右、行駛之狀況在某種之環境下、亦頗滿意、不論長途或短途之運輸公司、其營業方式概可為兩種、一種為訂定合同、按定價期者、一種為有定價而固定之交運者為適合現代都市之需要、汽車運輸事業、更易發達、船舶火車之抵埠或離埠者均需汽車為之轉、食物之按時分送、工業產物之分配、建築物之拆毀與建造、重大物件之移動、均不能不藉運輸汽車、汽車運輸現在已超出鐵路運輸、其比例約為鐵路貨運佔百分之四十六、汽車貨運則佔百分之五十四、尤以二百一十英里以下短距離之貨運為興旺、比較長距離貨運增多八倍、</p>
<p>在美國長途汽車運輸公司、其路綫在二百五十英里以上者、其規模之大、貨物裝卸悉照鐵路方式、與其擁有距數車輛、仍能獲得盈利、論者謂以大規模公司、經營長距離運輸、似不甚相宜、</p>
<p>汽車運輸之所以受人歡迎、與其如此發達、處胡種種理由、據由三萬五千四百六十八家商所舉出者、可列舉如下、</p>
<p>原因　客商百分比</p>
<p>運輸迅速……六五</p>
<p>可直達店門交卸……六五</p>
<p>總運費低廉……五三</p>
<p>可在店門　載……五一</p>
<p>比較有伸縮便利……四三</p>
<p>包裝比較價廉……二一</p>
<p>報裝之時間可較宴……二一</p>
<p>運價分類不繁……一六</p>
<p>貨物遺失與損失較少……一一</p>
<p>個人間之友誼與興趣……三</p>
<p>由上表觀之、一般歡迎汽車運輸者、以其迅速固甚明矣、復據統計、知汽車運輸之速率、平均每小時十五英里鐵路為五英里、水道為三至十英里、管中輸送（按美國煤油　所產煤油原油、大多以巨管輸至遠距礦場之精　廠、）每小時一至五英里、由此可知汽車運輸之速度、比鐵路快三倍、</p>
<p>汽車運輸之另一優點、為其路綫終點之選擇不若鐵路或輪埠之受　種限制、反之其終點乃極為活動而富有伸縮性、至於大公司之汽車路綫終點、亦有司機宿舍、管理、辦公室、及修車場等設備、</p>
<p>平常式樣之運輸汽車、司機人位置在車頭之後約三尺、現今新式運輸汽車乃高車頭式、司機人之位置即在引擎之下、可以高瞻遠矚、司機之視綫甚廣、雖在擁　之鬧市中、亦可準備運轉、其次戰貨之地位、比舊式增長不下三尺、再次為負載之重量、得平均分　於前後車輛上、其結果可使行駛更為經濟、</p>
<p>汽車運輸利用拖　、現亦逐漸增多、採用拖車之利益甚多、蓋在拖車裝卸貨物之時、卡車可以另拖其地拖車、或駛往修理廠修理、絕不致妨碍貨物之裝卸、而現今拖車之製造亦甚完善、其與卡車連接之機件、裝折極　、甚至司機人無須下車、亦可使拖車自動脫離、更有一種半拖車、（拖車之後半部裝有輪船、其前半部則攔架於卡車之後輪軸上者、在脫離卡車後、可藉其半部所裝之攔脚穩立於地、）因可用小馬力之小卡車拖帶、故其數量亦甚多、尤其適合於平地行駛、可增加負載甚多、新式半拖車之安全設備、最足稱道、卽在行駛途中不慎與卡車脫離、　自動放下攔脚、自動停止、不致有傾覆衝撞之危險也、</p>
<p>「美國汽車運輸速寫之營業帳略、與其成本計算之材料、頗不易得、　因各公司俱未詳細登帳也、其中有營業忙碌、記帳時間不充分而付缺如者、亦有僅計每年總收支、僅結出若干盈餘草草了事、至於大規模公司之記帳、雖比較詳細、但於分類統計仍嫌不足、因此關於車輛機件方面、何者有利、何者不經濟、俱難考查、以資將來取舍之標準、故此篇所列數字、僅可備為參考、不能引為全豹、</p>
<p>某一大汽車運輸公司、以一汽油引擎卡車、行駛於二百英里之路綫上、全年共行八萬英里、每程載重二十噸、共費一萬七千四百九十三美元、計每英里需美金二角二分、另一同式卡車行於四百英里路綫上、全年共駛九萬六千巨野、共費一萬九千六百五十七美元、約計每英里所費不足美金二角二分</p>
<p>後據加州所調查、公路運輸汽車之汽油消費量、可列表如次、</p>
<p>載重　每年行程　每介侖所行英里數（註）</p>
<p>三千磅以下　九三〇〇英里　一四·三五</p>
<p>三千至五千九百九十九磅　〇九〇〇英里　一一·四六</p>
<p>六千至七千磅　四八〇〇英里　八·一〇</p>
<p>一萬磅以上　九六〇〇英里　五·〇七</p>
<p>（註）此處為美國介侖、約等於英國介侖五分之四、或等於三、七五公升、</p>
<p>上表所列之數目、因其路綫限於加州一州內與行駛長途者、不能並論、</p>
<p>甚至有種種統計、企圖證明汽車運輸在某一里程、比鐵路運輸昂貴、但亦不否認在二百五十英里至三百英里之里程、以汽車運輸為經濟、惟現今七百至一千英里之長途汽車運輸營業、反蒸蒸日上焉、</p>
<p>美國政府每年從汽車運輸事業抽收之捐稅、必將超過十萬萬美元、據美國統計局發表、在一九三五年份、彼時僅有運輸汽車公司六萬一千二百七十六家、卡車十八萬八千八百〇九輛、已收稅五百三千〇八十六萬美元、其車輛總僅佔本年三分之一耳、</p>
<p>總之美國汽車運輸事業、雖有重稅之壓迫、與堅強之鐵路同業競爭、但其所供獻者已甚大、如減少失業人數、促進交通便利、間接促進汽車工程之進步、皆不可掩之事實也、</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>小朋友寫了「生活教育社成立會記」</p>
<p>前天，在一個淸爽的早晨，記者又是訪候陶行知先生於旅邸。像是得到意外的牧穫，陶先生賜下一份一生活敎育社成立大會紀錄」。</p>
<p>這篇紀錄的內容，生動活潑，眞誠有趣，分明是値得重視的材料。</p>
<p>尤其使我們興奮的，是筆記這篇紀錄的章常君。陶先生爲記者介紹　君與新安旅行團時，十足地表現　快樂與歡悅的顏色。記者亦深受感動，對于新中國的小主人與中華民族的前途充滿着無限的祈望。</p>
<p>原來小朋友　常君是新安旅行團的團員，現年僅十六歲而已。他的聰敏，能幹，會敎我們成年的這一代覺得十分愧煞！</p>
<p>童常是新安旅行團訓練出來的許多優秀的小友中的一個，這個吾國著名的嶄新兒童團體，亦很必要在此報道一下，以慰關心祖國的僑胞。</p>
<p>新安旅行團是實踐「生活即敎育」「社會卽學校」的信條而不斷地工作，不斷地學習。它的性質是一個旅行學校，亦是一個　作團。當綏　戰事發生的時候，該團　展開驚人的工作，博得國內外的關注與敬佩。七七燃起枋戰烽火之後，該團的大時代長征就彌加積極了。　凡，慰勞，籌募，官傳，演劇，　導兒童，組織兒童，促進軍民合作，推進救亡運動動……都表現了卓著的成績。他們足跡所經，已走遍了十一省，完成了二萬餘里的長征。他們經過的地方，就播下「新梯子」與襄助軍政當局，自己又在實生活中生長起來。的的確確是爲歷史創造鮮明的新頁。</p>
<p>查該團共有小朋友四十多人，最小僅十歲，最大者不過是十六七歲。一切的組織與運動，槪由兒，自行設計與分工合作。汪達之先生是他們的顧問，亦只限於「顧問」而並非　指揮。當生活敎育社—二月十五日在桂林成立時，該團適　亦在桂林，故全體參加，小朋友童常竟寫了一篇生動沽潑的紀錄。軍委會政治部現已特約該。出發西北各省工作。又特約上海孩子劇團前往西南各省工作。這二個新生的兒童團體同爲當局所重視血互相媲美着。</p>
<p>「誰說我們年紀小？」新中國的新主人，在苦難的時代生長起來了。</p>
<p>小朋友童常所紀錄的生活敎育社成立大會紀錄全文，原　在昨天本報發表，因排版關係，不得不稍爲延遲。又因爲原詞冗長，故只得摘錄精要者如下：</p>
<p>「生活敎育社成立大會會紀錄」摘錄：　新安履行團，常記。</p>
<p>武漢和廣州棄守，中央對第二期的抗戰作了新的佈置以後。桂林的空氣是在一種新的和諧之中，十二年來爲中國新敎育事業而奮鬥的生活敎育社，在廣西當局的提倡之下在桂林正式成立了。</p>
<p>十二月十五日在廣西省政府開成立會。到會社員及來賓約一千五百人。</p>
<p>興廣西同胞分別了用年多的陶行知先生，對十二年來的生活敎育做了一個簡明的報吿：</p>
<p>廣西省政府省黨部都有代表訓詞。省政府敎育廳邱廳長也很懇切地說</p>
<p>『生活敎育社在過去所努力的四種敎育上的運動，對國家非常有益，在廣西都是做了的，最近陶先生躱躱×機，又給我們　出一個「岩洞敎育」的建議。這個建議非常好，我們已經開始做了，幷且計劃吧它擴大起來作爲明年廣西成人敎育年的方案？……」</p>
<p>大會上通過了會章和卅三位理事十五位監　。理　實際上只有卅三個，因爲陶先生說：「我們的理監事中應有各民族的代表。回埃的代表有唐枸三先生，藏族的代表有喜饒　錯先生，可是蒙古的代表還沒有，我們相信不久一定會有的，所以空個名宇……」。在監　候選名單十五人中有一位是趙洪文國（卽趙老太太），這位老太太一方面代表滿族，一方面雖然只識得四個宇，但是她是中國游擊隊之母，是一個生活敎育的最忠實的實踐者，所以也被選爲監事。</p>
<p>人們突然站起來了，三千只眼光突然集中在禮堂的左門口接着就是一片暴雷般的掌聲，原來是轉戰全國舉世景仰的白崇　將軍來了！</p>
<p>主席與奮地說：「現在請白副總長講演。」</p>
<p>拍拍拍……拍拍拍……白將軍安詳的說着：</p>
<p>『我今天　的是「全面戰爭興全面戰術」。</p>
<p>「……我們對日本××主義抗戰，是民族革命的戰爭，所以應該是全面戰爭，戰術要配合戰爭，所以我們應該是全面戰術……</p>
<p>「這種仗要怎麼打呢？</p>
<p>『平常學校中研究的是正規戰，都是同等裝備，同等技術的軍事對比．像上面這種的情形的戰鬥，醫上沒有，圖上沒有，先生也沒有請過我們在學校裏也沒有學過。——我個人就根本沒有學過。</p>
<p>「我們只有從經驗裏　造新的戰術，新的戰術是什麼呢？就是避擊戰，運動戰陣地，等綜合運用的全面戰術。………」</p>
<p>白將軍講得很正確，很斬决，地從全面戰術的過程中，給生活敎育做了一個好的說明。</p>
<p>最後白將軍覺　中國抗戰至少要三年才能勝利：『有些人也許會以爲「啊：還有十八九個月哩」！但我要吿訴他們，我們十五年革命時，打北洋軍閥還打了二年，現在打　樣一個世界上頭等兇暴的日本××主義，我說之少三年，價還開高了嗎？』</p>
<p>偶然幽默地插話引得閧堂大笑。鼓掌聲延長了三分鐘之久。全體自動起立致敬，直到白將軍走到自己的坐位上。</p>
<p>陶先生站起致謝說：</p>
<p>『剛才白副總長說：新的戰術就是遊擊戰，運動戰，陣地戰粽合運甩的全面戰術。這是一個眞理。同樣，蔣委員長在衡山會議所發表的五個方針，其中一個就是汪重遊擊戰。我們敎育的一個責任就是宣揚眞理，我們應該把蔣白二公所述的眞理敎給大家知道。但是敎員還有一個責任就是駁斥　。</p>
<p>新安旅行團小朋友唱的三只歡受到熱烈的歡迎，尤其是小朋友們天眞地唱到「想一想，還是混帳的王八旦」時，全場又閧動鼓掌了。白將軍高興得大笑，並抓住他的五六議的小孩子的手，帮他鼓掌。</p>
<p>敎育家而又兼大衆詩人的陶先生又笑逐顏開的出來了：</p>
<p>『現在是全面抗戰，武人要文裝，女人要武裝。我剛才做了一首小詩：「文人武化，武人文化，不文不武的文武化。文武不再相罵，聯合起來創造新天下！」現在就請中國文學界的泰斗，武裝的郭沬若先生講演。』（羣笑，鼓掌。）</p>
<p>郭先生慢呑呑的走上來，他忍不住的老是笑。平常那種演說家的丰度，戰鬥的雄姿不見了，他溶和在充滿了孩子朝氣的愉快的氣氛里。</p>
<p>「在白先生講話之後，有新安旅行團和中山紀念學校的小朋友們在大家面前來表演，我看了眞覺得慚愧。</p>
<p>『中國有一句俗話說「一代不如一代」，今天看了小朋友的活動，深深地覺得是「一代不如一代」。古人的意思是說後代不如前代，但是我們今天看釗的「一代不如一代」，是前代不如後代啊！（鼓掌）</p>
<p>「僅備這一點，就是够証明最後勝利一定是我們的。別的小朋友團體我不大淸楚，對於新安旅行團和孩子劇團，我是比較淸楚的。新安旅行團是在抗戰前就從江蘇出發了，已經走了三萬里路，在西北留了很深的影響；這一囘到南方來，我們看到他們的工作，是多麼有條理，多麼努力啊！</p>
<p>「孩子劇團是抗戰後在上海組織的，上海淪陷後，他們跑出來，從南通鄭州到了武漢，做了很多的工作，這是大家都知道的。</p>
<p>「新安旅行團和　子劇團是誰創造出來的？都是我們中國的「襲斯塔洛　」陶先生創造出來的。</p>
<p>『生活敎育是注重實踐，啟發自覺性和創造性的。是要把教育和生活密切地連繫起來的，所以又有一生活卽敎育」，「社會的學校」的口號，小朋友們就是實踐了這種方針和原則與我們前一代的人不相同的。新安旅行團，孩子劇團是生活敎育的具體化，標本！</p>
<p>〔最近政治部對宣傳工作確定了兩個原則：「宣傳即敎育，」「服務卽宣傳』，這也可以說　模仿陶先生的「生活卽敎育」，「社會卽學校」的。這個宣傳原則的决定是生活敎育十二年外努力的結果，也可以說是一年多的抗戰使我們覺得我們需要生活敎育。</p>
<p>現在小朋友們就在諸位的面前，他們是多　純潔，多麼勇敢。希望每一個人都能够　這些小朋及一樣，以純潔無垢的精神，創造出一　純潔無垢的「新中國！』（鼓掌）</p>
<p>『郭先生又吿訴我們一個眞理：「跟孩子們學」！』</p>
<p>上海救亡演劇第二隊的『逃難到桂林』在金山和王瑩的領導不演出，賺了不少的歡笑與淚水。散會的時候，白將軍又被朋友們包聞了。有的小朋友把他的演講記下來要求他修正。有些小朋友圍上去向他打仗的事情。他　新安放行團的小朋友講到西北的情形，他問：「春天我到寧夏的時候　們在那兒嗎？」</p>
<p>最後他吿訴小朋友說：『我在××街××學校辦公，你們明大來找我』。</p>
<p>電燈亮起來的時候，這位威武的將軍和大眞的孩子們作了熱烈地握別。</p>

<p>香港醫生太多了，尤其是現在。在往日杳港已經有『醫生多過病人』一句話；現在又多了一批從廣州等地跑來作避難執業的中西醫。那末醫生的數目亦就增加很多了！可是醫生雖然多，，病幷不覺得容易，我們知道　：普通中醫診金要一元，西醫要二元或三元，請他門上，中醫要三元，西醫要五元，早晚加倍，遠路加倍，渡海又要增加，普通人有病，到中醫館去醫，一天最少要一元診金，一元多藥材，連同軍費最少要兩三塊錢。倘若請醫生到家裏診脈，一天　要五六塊錢。到內醫館去醫，連同診金藥水，最少一天要五六塊錢，請西醫到來家裏，一天最少要十元八塊。</p>
<p>假定七天病好的話，到中醫館要花二十多塊錢，請中醫到家裏要花三四十塊錢。到西醫館要花三四十塊錢，請西醫到家裏要花六七十塊錢。</p>
<p>上面的數目，在生活程度日高的香港，對於一般支　階級或小商人實在是一個很嚴重的威脅。月人百元的人，不幸遇着家裏有一個人害了病，那麼不論要花三四十塊錢或四五十塊，都是給他經濟上一個大大打擊。入息少的勞苦大衆，更加堪不設想，他們對於上面的辨法當然做不到，結果祗有　俗語說：「有　錢抵。無錢命抵。』無錢人害了大病，唯有死—</p>
<p>上面說過的醫藥費用，不過是普通的稍有聲譽的中西醫生，素費更加不止這個數目，我知道有這有名聲的中西醫到診要五元，門診要一元，遠追加倍……最近更有的到診廿元，掛號費丘元，門診三十元……的。著名的西醫，到診要互元，門診十元，竟有深夜　五十元方肯上門　症者。如是種種，病在香港的人，求醫眞不易了！</p>
<p>縱使你是富有的人，但是邊着醫得不好的醫生，你也難供應他的需求。這是眞確的事，我有一個朋友。到　科，生裏　眼，花了十塊錢，得囘一　　酸水．</p>
<p>你會說書還有政府辦，公立和敎會辦的書院，但是你須知利香港和九龍祗有十多間醫院，而香港和九龍的人口却有百萬過外，求供相差太遠了！</p>
<p>醫院的費用也不見得少，普通公立或私立的醫院，上等房每天連醫　費要上二塊錢至廿多塊錢，中等的要十元八塊，最廉的也要三四塊，——雖然也有五角錢的，但是因爲　種關係，稱為拿得錢出的人，也頗住較責些的　或</p>
<p>說到所謂『私家聲院』，雖然較好，但是費用却驚人，院費，醫費，藥費，膳費，培伴人的住宿費，甚至一些　花，一些火酒也要計錢，有一個朋友人去醫了六天，出院時辦事人便給他一張四百多元的請單，他看了惟有搖搖頭，歎一口　。</p>
<p>院　　未能劇除，侍役，　　，等因爲病人住房高下，賞錢多少而有所歧視。服務時很多不能忍耐斥喝病人，做事革率不肯盡力……如是種種，都是對於醫院　　很可惜的事！</p>
<p>慈善機關設立的　院看　太少了。甚至病人受太陽　蒸晒，或受其他施術時，都沒有看　來「看護」。結果因爲病人無人救　。儀器沒有人管理……而發生很危險的事件……</p>
<p>不要　的　醫施藥機關，因爲求醫人多；醫生太忙，辦事人不够用用……便有　革的事發生，我會經目擊：五分鐘內。一個男生連續診究六個病人。</p>
<p>當値，生時間大約　　吧（？）病人太多吧（？）往往病人危急時很難找立刻戊釗醫生—……</p>
<p>病人何辜，旣受病的痛苦，受金錢的損失，受壓迫的痛苦，又受待遇不良的痛苦！</p>
<p>這是真話：「病在香港是一件慘事！」</p>

<h3 id="c20">周作人與魯迅 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>讀本月四日的報紙，知道周作人氏于三日在北平寓所被二靑年行刺受重傷，在汪案才發生的波浪裏，又是一件引人注意的事。</p>
<p>周作人雖爲魯迅先生的介弟。但兩人走着完全相反的道路。魯迅先生是堅决的主張抗日，以求民族之自由解放；所以他雖死，人一談到抗戰，就想到魯迅先生；談到魯迅先生，也就想到抗戰，魯迅先生，是千代百世，爲人敬仰的民族靈魂，但是周作人可不同了，這在『苦雨齋」裏喝了十年『苦茶』的老人，×人佔領北平了，他糊塗到跟民族的×人，哥　的×人去高談『更生中國文化！』</p>
<p>記得日本有一班喜歡研究中國文學的人，組織了一個『中國文學研究會』，他們出了一個機關雜誌，名日『中日文學』（請讀者注意：他們不用『支那』或『支那文學』），在某一期裏，登載周氏兄弟的文章，並有一幅插畫。畫旁兄弟二人似都各有一首詩，記不淸楚，身邊又無他們的　作可查，只好從略了。至于那幅插畫畫的是：一個高塔，魯迅先生坐鎮塔頂，領導普　文學運動，塔下有一小河，河上架一小布爾橋，對岸橋頭，周作人氏　着白馬過不了小布　橋。現在，這位騎着白马的「苦茶」大家，非但過不了这小布　桥，而且走到相反的方向去——騎著白馬，拉起白旗。走到×人的陣营裏去了。</p>
<p>在五四新文學運動初期，周氏兄弟，原都是文坛健將。那个時期的功绩，從文化，文學史的觀點來說，是不能抹煞的。只可惜的，周作人不懂得歷史的發展，社會的化，抵不過時代的洪流，實際的鬭爭。在魯迅先生挺身而出，領導着進步的文化人，進步的文學者，爲眞理，爲正義，爲反抗黑暗的暴力，爲爭取抗日戰爭前途，而艱苦　爭的時候，周作人却逃避現實，躱到「苦雨齋」裏去喝「苦茶」，淸閒逸致，不問世事，事還小，在他的意思，也許還阿Q地諷刺魯迅先生的「多事」哪。從那個時候，周作人的進步的意義一經消失了，他已背上了一個負的盾牌，變成了歷史的人物。大約是三年前吧，日本的貴族院讓員，日本主義的國學家三上參次，在議院發表了無恥的演說，謂中國不應叫人改稱中華民國，支那才是中國的國名。記得周作人會寫大章奧罵過他。當時我們很欣慰他還保存一點『五四精神』。想不到兩年後，他竟跟×人共談「更生中國文化」，認爲中國人非到日本去不能認識日本的好處—这眞使人痛惜，但也是「喝苦茶」的必然歸結吧。文壇上的動搖安協怕鬥爭的落伍文士，與政治上的搖動妥協怕鬥爭的失意政客，是沒有什麼分　的。</p>
<h3 id="c21">夕陽下 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 晚萸</p>
<p>不相識的朋友，你該記得：當你第一天來到此地的時候，正是夕陽西落的黃昏；這見的黃昏是美麗的，神秘的，而且使人迷醉的。不是嗎？天空彩色的晚霞，反映在用玻璃石砌成的小洋房的牆壁上，調合着希臘時代繪畫上所不能發現的玄奇的顏色。</p>
<p>在過去，這個境界裏面，波　若無窮盡的甜情蜜意，影映着無窮盡的綺麗風光；玻璃石小洋房的女人，蓓蓓，是一個姣媚的女性，像芍藥，像牡丹。每天穿了艷裝的晚服，站立於門前的小花圃畔，遙眺天邊的彩霞，似乎是一種無法間斷的習慣。它的秋波和笑容，會鈎引了來往行人的視線，汽車的司機也會因它而闖了禍。</p>
<p>然而，你來之後，這種骯髒的，黃萎的，破爛的樣子，就把整個美的境界破壞了。所謂破壞，便是姣媚的蓓蓓，便躱藏起來啦，也許是怕你滿身的惡味引起她的嘔吐。可是我，那天黃昏照例要經過此地時，像是欣賞一幅名貴的圖畫似的，我是被你這個突來的點綴品吸住了。</p>
<p>我的意思，以爲在如此富麗而神秘的景物中增添一個骯髒破爛的你，倘使這眞是一幅圖畫，則這畫面上所含蓄的意義，的確是很難得的。</p>
<p>但，我是不會想到爲了這種假想的欣賞竟至產生另外一種問題來的：</p>
<p>濃黑的眉毛，炯亮的瞳子，長的耳朶，正直的鼻梁，你面部的這些記號，印在我的　版上己經很久很久：不過，我是從什麼地方替你攝下了這麼親熱的影像的呢？囘到寓所，這一宵我就爲着你而失眠，我責難自己健忘，我怨恨自己的記憶力太差。</p>
<p>第二天淸早，再經過你處，你已躺在人行道上了，你的身體蓋覆着一條草蓆，那草蓆輕輕地在顫動，我想一定是你抵抗不住空氣裏的寒冷；而在瑟　發抖吧？縱使你體格强健，怕也難免病魔的侵襲吧？誰知，你眞的竟因此而致疾了：從此你無力掙扎起來，終日似睡非睡地，老是用着一雙炯亮的瞳子沉默地看着那玻璃石小洋房的大門。你沒有呼喊，沒有呻吟，同時也好像不飢不渴，時間一天一天滑了去，夕陽的光輝一次一次射到你的臥處，悄悄地，始終是悄悄地。</p>
<p>深藏在小洋房裏的姣媚的蓓蓓，也悄悄地不見踪跡了。放在車間裏的蘋　綠的奧司汀，那嘹亮的喇也靜默起來了。</p>
<p>可是，懸在我心頭的仍然是無法解决的問題；我認識你，不過我忘了我們晤面的時間以及地點。</p>
<p>我預備把它當作一個「謎」擱起來的時候，悶葫蘆却給開啟了：</p>
<p>最後一天，我到霞飛路，經過一個外國照相館的門，被一張放在玻璃憲內的照片喚囘了我的記憶；原來留給我腦海裏的影像就是這照片，照片上的臉蛋就是你啊；濃黑的眉毛……一副風流英俊的表情，看着來往的行人微笑。</p>
<p>爲了想解决一重疑案，我推開了照相館的玻璃門。我癡獃地希冀從照相館任何聯員的嘴裏尋出你的秘密。雖然我是失望了，然而在這兒我又發現了，一個奇跡。什麼呢？掛在照相館店堂　壁上的許多彩色放大樣照中，也有一幅是你的，而且你身畔有一個姣媚的女人，我細細一看，怎麼？那女人竟是玻璃石小洋房的女主人蓓蓓—我疑心自己是做夢，事實上我却不在夢裏。</p>
<p>我於是恍悟了，像偵緝員破了一個機關一樣。我急忙坐了街車歸來，我想慰問你幾句，不，或者是欲從你嘴裏找點寫作的材料。那裏　得，囘來時已不見了你，你己離別人世，留下的遺屍，給普善山莊收去掩埋了。</p>
<p>看着地上的濕痕，我心頭浮起一層惆悵。</p>
<p>你年靑，你英勇，時代需要你啊，未料你竟錯用了你的戰鬭的精神，而今捐軀於『這個』沙場上！</p>
<p>黃昏又來到了，夕陽光輝照例射到破璃石小洋房上，因爲照例有姣媚的蓓蓓出來玉立閒眺，所以這裏環境依舊恢復了先前的美麗與神秘，你之死，並沒有給予此地絲毫的影響呀。</p>
<p>是這樣，倘使靈而有知，我希望你懺悔，永遠地懺悔！</p>
<h3 id="c22">女性的公敵 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 廈沙</p>
<p>上週讀報，知道希特拉創立了獎勵毋親生育會，且新訂獎章多種，多生子女的女人，可分別領得銅銀金各十字獎韋，掛在襟頭，表示『有功于國」。而慕沙里尼差不多同時又高聲大叫：『人類之有戰爭，猶婦女之有生育』這兩位法西的結拜兄弟，一唱一和，眞是「理論高深」，「生子有道了」</p>
<p>翻開歷史。我們再找不出比希特拉和慕沙里尼，更摧殘和屠殺女性的了。他們眞是全世界女性們的（公×）天字第一號的『公×』！</p>
<p>他們爲了建立一憫（褐色）的第三帝國，爲了恢復古羅馬帝國的光榮，尤其爲了保障國內寡頭的金融資本家的　包，便不惜挑起毀滅戰爭，不惜把成千成萬在社會做事的女性一批一批　推回家裏—尤其是推到床上，實行所謂『有功于國』的生育；把女性們綿延人類種族的神聖天職，　成大量製造炮灰的機器。想不到褐色元首相黑衫宰相的佈置下，一個小小的法西斯家庭裏——也許就在床上帳中，也充滿了『戰霎彌漫』的空氣！</p>
<p>照這兩位仁兄的意見，似乎婦女生子越多就越『有功于國』；那末生子起碼就一打以上，而且一年二次生育的『猪　』就該値得敬佩和學習了。也許希特拉和慕沙里尼正在動員大量科學家研究『猪　生育法」，以便將來推行『猪　政策』。倘使有一天，他們研究成坊了，實行起來，那末德意志和意大利的婦女不是个个都以『猪　』的姿熊出現麼？這自然是『有功于國』，應給「金十字獎章」了。</p>
<p>如果這種「新的母性型」眞的在法西斯國家出現時，全世界的女性該多麼的恥辱，多麼的難堪——一个女性眞的徒然是一隻「生育的動物」，徒然是一副「製造炮灰的機器」麼？</p>
<p>女性們爲了自己的自由和幸福，爲了人類的正義興和平，我以爲全世界的女性都要不分國籍，聯合起來，撲　這兩个『女性的公敵』，打倒這對使婦女性道德　的落法西斯傢伙！</p>
<h3 id="c23">國難財 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 桑子</p>
<p>任你孰讀子平，或者精研麻衣，也想不到除了『正財』『偏財』之外，在目下還有『國雖財。』</p>
<p>據說：「正財」是份內的，勞力的報酬；「偏財」是意外的，幸運的收穫；前者是正當的，後者是僥倖的。這在一般知命的或者識相的朋友看來，都是命中注定，或者相貌生就的，是不可强求，也無法強求。這且不管他。誰知抗戰時期，却有不少人發起「國難財」來，害得我們馬實初博士，要呈請政府緝捕懲辦。倘使子平先生和麻衣道人地下有知，必將感謝馬博士爲他們糾正一般人的錯誤的星相觀吧？</p>
<p>誠然，那般不肖份子，不顧廉恥，甘心媚敵，並且乘機勾結一般浪人，從事各項破壤抗戰工作，而從中獲取巨利，其險惡勝於×人，實己罪不容誅；若使寬容，國家蒙害，必致日深，我們贊成馬傳士的主張，對這些發『國難財」者，希望政府頒訂有效制裁辦法，通飭厲行，然而事實上發「國難財」者，却不僅祇有這些不肖：別的姑且暫置不說，醫如：「香島上有若干「房東」和若干「二房東」，他們也乘着「國難」，大發其「財」哩！</p>
<p>若干「房東」和若干「二房東」他們乘着國難，乘人之危，橫加房金，或者濫抬租價，罔知人家流離失所，家園破碎之苦，祇求財帛進門。供其坐享之樂，這種自私自利的行爲，縱然丟開會影響整個抗戰事業的進程而不說，就是以人類應相互帮助的一點來講，也是需要加以痛責的</p>
<p>我們希望：社會人士對於這類以房屋作爲發「國難財」的工具者，也要加以一番淸算！</p>
<h3 id="c24">懷茅盾先生 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 文俞</p>
<p>計稈他該已到達昆明了吧，茅盾先生而　視一切黃口小輩；相反的他是以家長十九日給我信，吿知我他的離開，二十日他就離開這裏了，無緣一面。心裏有的是無限的懊悔，像存在着一個難以補價的損失，爲之不怡者數日。他，我是作爲我的第一位最親愛的師長而景仰，祟敬，愛護着的。</p>
<p>北地苦寒，怕已是積雪沒脛的時候了，愁慘的天凍結着層雲，低沉　黑黯，遙遠的風砂，撲刺行人臉。沒有烏的歌唱，沒有虫的低吟，白皚皚的原野鑽不出一絲綠意，怕只有綿互的山巒，音糜巳　的古道，有悲壯的塞上名馬的嘶風，有蒼鷹舒展着偉大的雙翅……先生懷着熱情，向大西北的「新地」邁步了，在天南海角的我，逆着北來的風，敬致旅途平安的禱祝。</p>
<p>西北，壯美的山河，祖國的臂膊。大自然母親，在這裏，磨鍊着孩子們，像是對孩子作無情的夏楚。然而孩子們就因之有着鐵皮般的雙手，有着抗風雪的被强的軀幹「這襄沒有春天」一句話，成爲他們生活鬥爭的驕傲語了。先生是文弱，然而他有鉅大的希望，他要生活在那裏，作爲靑年們的「靈魂的導師」，指示他們爲這一代的光榮戰鬥」—因而我虔誠的爲他的生活和希望而禱祝。</p>
<p>然而，我這時是多麼妬忌呵！先生是對西北靑年有了偏愛嗎？或者是我們南方的孩子的慵愚，不値先生的訓誨？不，不是的—時代需要着他的力量，大的力量要有大的境界才能展開。西北的「新地」需要先生去開墾，他就不得不冒大風雪，奔長途，去沉重地負起等待着他的一担。我想，我的妬忌應該放開吧，可是一種羨慕之念是放不開了的。</p>
<p>先生之來。是這裏文藝靑年一個大歡喜。他是一個楷模却不不是偶像。他是一位揚旗先導的統率者，不是作爲一個大人，以師尊，以朋友的愛護，訓導，親切給予了他們。因此他們便有了蓬勃勃的向上的發展的活力力</p>
<p>茅盾先生有着藝術的寬容。他很知道，假如他用那雙透徹一切的眼，去照射我們這些還「不很够格」的作品，便只是一塊沒光彩的木頭，只是一撤海砂。可是，或許這木頭還可雕刻成藝術呢，或許這一撤海砂也含金質吧，他就覺着藝術可以有某稈度的寬容，不惜使他自己的心血交注的刊物弄成有點「榛楛弗剪」的狀態了。——這寬容，不知振奮了幾許我們　藝靑年的心，使我們感知我們應該向前趕去—</p>
<p>他又有着藝術的謹嚴，他很知道，假如他不給予「後生」以一種規範，他們將迷糊而枉費了他們的努力，他們將找不出眞正的　道的，因此的謹嚴合着寬容成雙美，甚或是「雙絕」—雖然「　木不可雕也」，但他决不會忘了指點，要是朽木之中還有美質，於是去朽存堅，親自來動手一番，他的苦心，誰不去體會，誰就是自甘損失，要是誰能眞切的體會，誰就獲得最寳貴的敎訓。</p>
<p>「茅盾先生和魯迅先很相像吧？」或許問。是的，茅盾先生現在是繼續着他的老朋友的工作，現在是担肩著雙倍的責任了。景宋女士在「魯迎和靑年們」（文陣二卷一期）裏有一段話：「有時遇到國外友人，詢及中國知識界的前　，先生（魯迅）必舉××先生，××靑年以吿……且時常掛念及××先生的身體太弱，還不及他自己。如今先生不幸逝去二周年了，希望××先生等爲國珍攝，努力前途。」是的，魯迅先生，這韌性鬥十的逝去，茅盾先生就有着加倍的重任，「爲國珍攝」的至意，献給萬里外的這位文學巨人。</p>

<p>【本報專訊】本届女子籃球　，自廣大知行相繼退出後、致多角爭標之形勢、一變為鼎足而立、</p>
<p>梅芳、培道、　橋、是當今三雄、惟華僑出師不利、曾一敗於知行、再敗於培道、地位動搖、奪標希望、已不比梅芳及培道之高、雖因知行退出、其得以將該次失敗取銷、前途復露一綫　光、惟已一改而沾小疵矣、</p>
<p>觀察近勢、梅芳培道均未嘗一敗、對于錦票、有惟我與使君　概、但培道日前既勝華僑、退一勁敵、其形勢較、梅芳則不然、因培道華僑均未與戰也、</p>
<p>所以、今夕梅芳與華僑之戰、於錦標問題、關係甚大、如梅芳得勝、則渡過一難關、其地位形勢、便與培道無異，俟十四夕與培道比　、　時勝利者、則冠軍屬之、</p>
<p>若今夕梅芳失敗、形勢當為之一變、既有利增道、亦有利於華僑、惟華僑所得之利，仍須因人成　、蓋今夕華僑如勝、尚有待終十四夕梅芳戰培道、看左券誰操、然後可定本身生死之命運、如到其時培道又歷倒梅芳者、則冠軍為培道所得、而華僑與梅芳、祇作亞軍之爭而已、</p>
<p>故華僑為一己之利、對今夕及十四夕兩役、必具有一種矛盾心理、其今夕所欲求者、能敗梅芳、至十四夕所欲求者、乃望梅芳能敗培道、惟此種過於利己之理想恐未必得成事實、然球事多夢、或竟成事實亦未可料也</p>
<p>總之、今夕此戰、在華僑而言、勝尚有望、敗則絕緣、故為本身前途計、必與梅芳拚個死活、而在梅芳亦未敢自許必勝也、</p>
<p>寄語迷男迷女、今夕提早到場、因健身室座位不多、　到恐有　　　遺之嘆、比賽秩序如下、【東郎】</p>

<p>娛樂……三姊妹　Sally，Irene　And　Mary</p>
<p>是一部歌舞家、音樂家，播音明星、銀幕紅伶集中在一起的歌舞片、故事散漫、但是一部歌舞片，不一定須要完美的故事、只是靠着華麗的排場、和歌舞諧趣的穿揷、便成功一部能够娛人的「歌舞　片」了、</p>
<p>愛麗絲費、湯尼馬丁歌舞演技甚優　、太鼻子傑美杜倫的諧趣如恒、也是片中出色一個角色、</p>
<p>皇后平安……鉄　英雄　Men　With　Wings</p>
<p>全片叙述三四十年來美國航空事業的　化　、也可說是人類征服太空的經過、作一　系統的叙述、同時我們常承認、這也是有電影史以來、一部偉大而有價值的作品、</p>
<p>故事取材似乎太廣汎、因之情節沉長、令人略感劇力的不足、但是種種緊張驚險的場面、完全掩飾了這個缺點、像飛行遇險、空中大血戰、出死入生的試驗飛行、第二次橫渡大洋西的壯舉、從着火的機中用降落傘逃生　、這些都是極刺激力的場面、還有着滿懷熱情的人們、抱着大無畏的精神、凌空的壯志、做着轟轟烈烈的壯舉、在他們背後，還有着鼓勵和帮助、同時担憂忍泣着的女人、　些這些、都是　富操縱觀眾　緒的力量、</p>
<p>彩色的採用於此片是再適合沒有了、開始那些田野風　、以至各種顏色鮮艷的飛機翱翔在滿佈彩雲的藍色空際、畫面的美麗、均加觀眾不少的美感、</p>
<p>弗萊麥克茂萊、雷密勒的演技、皆極精鍊、女主角魯意絲肯貝爾、是一個新進的明星、往時嘗演一些比較平凡的片子、沒受人家多大的注意、在此中、我們發見她是一個極可造就的人材、</p>
<p>東方……革命情侶　Beloved　Enemy</p>
<p>一張愛爾蘭革命的彭片、曼兒奧朗飾一英國駐愛勃總督的女兒、她都同情了愛爾蘭的革命、而戀上了他們的首領（勃蘭阿倫）、</p>
<p>導演處理本片相當成功、幾幕搜捕　黨場面亦很緊張、　能抓住全劇高潮、男女主角都很稱職、</p>
<p>大華……西線間諜網　Lancer　Spy</p>
<p>故事描寫一個英國軍官、因面貌同德國一位軍官相像的、而德軍官被英軍俘虜了、他就扮成德國軍官回去刺探敵情、可是那德國軍官有一位戀人、這戀人就為德國做反間諜工作、不想他們真的互相墮入情網、吐露真情、放那位假的德軍官回去</p>
<p>似這類間諜活動的故事、過去曾有過不少、本片當然算不得新頴、全片處理得很鬆懈、尤其是前半部太沉悶了、兩位主角喬治山德斯及陶樂　　　　也沒有特色的演出、</p>
<p>景星……雙全忠愛　Sta　boll　Quest</p>
<p>茂娜洛埃和喬治勃來　主演</p>
<p>中央……蘆宮秘史　The　Prlsoner　of　Zenda</p>
<p>英雄美人的故事、男主角考爾門在這　一人兼飾二角、演來出神入化、女主角曼黛琳卡洛兒、配角如小范朋克等都有優秀的演出、</p>

<p>— 于學政</p>
<p>欲使體格强　除運勸外、尚須充分的營養、有許多人雖然運動特動、但結果不僅毫無進步反的後退、也就是因為缺芝營養之故、今日非常時期中的體育既側重於於氣與力的鍛鍊、當然以劇重的運動為最適宜、　劇重的運動須消耗大量的氣力、　必須增加營養以資　補、不活動的人所需要的營養自遠在多活動或工作勞苦的人之下、體格愈强健肌食慾愈熾、運動亦能使體內各活躍、並使各部器官的功能調和，增進官能之效率、於是消化機能旺盛。</p>
<p>總之、運動與營養有密切的關係、如運動缺乏、雖有富終營養的食物、亦不能　　、又如營養不足、則運動亦不能奏效、充分的營養或適當的食物足以輔助運動的功效、</p>
<p>適當的食物不僅能輔助運動、並能輔助醫藥或直接醫治多種疾病、心臟病、痛　、腎臟炎、詹石、支膚病、神經炎以及風濕等疾病之形成常由於營養才缺乏或食物之失　、許多人以為祇須多食富終營養的食物則能保持健康、無須運動、比賽一種錯誤的觀念、</p>
<p>富於營養的食物、並非必為山珍海　等一類的食物、此種食物在營養上不僅遠　於菜　、普通的肉　、鷄蛋等食物、即在消化及同化作用上亦有遜色、如不能水貨、　食極富於營養的食物、亦無益處、况且山珍海錯等奢侈之物、在今日抗戰時期內極不宜用、</p>
<p>有許多人以為營養一定是指食物的質量而言、其實不然，與最有關係的並非食物的質量、却為飲食的方法與習慣、在戰期內、食物質量、更感缺乏、補救的方法則為注重飲食的方法、</p>
<p>飲食的方法或習慣、與日常生活有密切的關係、日常生活不規則或有悖健康原則、對於進食的習慣與方法的影響甚大、所以欲改良飲食的習慣興方法、必先使日常生活合乎健康的原則、</p>
<p>關於每日應食幾餐的問題、有主張三餐者、亦有主張多至五餐者、各異其辭、但以主張日食三餐者為數最多、每日的餐數與每餐的食量成反比例、餐數愈多、每餐的食量愈少、如日進三餐，則早餐之食量應最少、晚膳應最多、如晚膳的質量適當、次日不食早餮亦可，所以有人主張日食兩餮、即午膳與晚膳、但工作勞苦的人、如每日祇食兩餮、　可在上午十時用午膳、下午六時用晚騰、</p>

<p>— 球場舊侶</p>
<p>凡此種類、豈不俱足以證今之球人之抱藝確遠未如前耶，不寧唯是、茍曾觀前週愛爾蘭對葡蔔牙之國際比賽者當尚憶小告山奴之氣力技術之如何不濟乃彼獨能於苦賽幾已力盡之下、仍可窺隙而進匹馬單刀獨勝一球、又葡隊之左內　高美士（亦有譯作金氏者、其實葡音　如上譯）、雖不能謂為技劣、要亦非絕頂高强之人也，乃當日究能藉愛隊於注神監視大告山奴之際，獨射四球，此又何如事耶？須知當日之愛爾蘭隊雖未得云强，然其中一內衛，固米杜息隊中之施　，實今各隊有名內衛之一也，更何况守門者為被認為今之守門一等好手之海軍隊「紅　公」麥亞利士打，然則今之足球隊之技術水準為遠不如前，又得一鐵證矣，</p>
<p>夫足球固吾國在體育競投中之最有勝利把握者也、則吾人　何如以葆之乃為當務之急、不佞之大聲疾呼曰「香港足球技術水準礦有今不如昔之事實」、非欲有所　於今之球人、實為一種促進吾國體育、并亟亟於求能保存吾國威覇遠東之足球盛譽而勿墮之一種內心呼籲、　　球諸子、必毋存自大之心、務須常作百尺竿頭、進一步想、有厚幸焉、</p>
<p>或有疑而問者曰、子既關心足球之事如許、則今港中球人果如何而可謀更進乎？則曰、今港中西隊之球藝既日形退化、則競技而全勝猶未足以增我港僑球躉於分亳也、　也由全事者搜集教材才書、　先覺者依書而加後覺者以積極之訓練、一有機會、即游戲他方以求得力之切磋、斯上策也。側聞東華會　於是年南游爪哇、順道　澳洲之舉、事如實現、必獲大益、既有如斯機會可乘、則南華會主事者似宜盡力以求其成、毋再計較於一時之成敗利鈍、須知一體育會有如南華會之歷史者、其所負之責任寔殊　大、應以為國訓練人才為前提、責無傍貸者也、他如東方會、球員既盡我華僑、則亦宜盡己之力景所及，多　會員遠游以求他山之攻錯為寫、本港錦票之爭、特其　事耳（完）</p>

<p>在這法西斯侵略者到處燃放戰火之際，我們居然　聆美總　的演說於前，英首相的宣言於後，不能不認爲一九三九年新年的喜訊，而向讀者報吿。</p>
<p>美統總羅斯福四日在議會的演購，沉痛指出法西斯侵略者正在擴大戰爭，威脅世界，　威脅美國一日不可缺少的宗敎，民主主義與國際信義；羅氏繼乃指出美國要求自由辛福及克盡其對世界所負的使命，則必須毅然决然，不惜犧牲，準備以武力制止法西斯侵略，道篇演說不祗　國內强調了修改美國現行外交政策國防計劃和中立法等等號召。並且在國際擴大了和平陣綫的聲威，對於不久以前屈服在日德意侵略者　面而今日自受苦惱的民主，國，尤爲濟新的刺激。接　英首相張伯倫亦于五日發表宣言了—他除了表示贊同羅斯福演說之外，還特別說明「吾人歡迎羅氏所表示之感想，認此爲美國居世界重要地位之又一明徵，並悉美國能熱心擁護人類類進步之理想。」從英美兩國首長這種明朗的表示，證明和平民主各國的團結，已經現出更光明的前途，又可證明我國堅特團結抗戰，具備着更光明的前途。我們今日應該更加堅定正確的立場，站在和平陣綫，爲反對法西斯侵略者而加倍努力。勝利的光輝，已照耀在母一個不願做奴隷的人們的面前了！</p>
<p>加緊清掃工作</p>
<p>國際情勢日益好轉，國內政治進步，抗戰局面已呈穩定，這些事實證明今年我們將走上勝利之路。但是在這勝利之路上還有許多障碍物。現在特別値得注意的，第一是汪精衛投降路綫沒　，雖然聯帶的把世所主倡的德意路綫也宣吿沒落，而他的　言者和機關報等還繼續用各種方式，簪他辯飾。惑亂人心。第二是×國的近衛內閣雖已崩潰，雖聯帶的暴露了日本國內與國際危機的嚴重，　是繼之而起的平沼內閣已經强橫的宣言繼續侵華，而觀乎他們五日在滬散發荒謬傳單一舉，足証×人漢奸一切和平分裂的陰謀，今後將變本加厲—這些都是我們勝利途上的障礙，必須加緊淸除。現在重慶方面巳經發起淸除妨碍民族革命抗戰的刊物的運動，全國將領各省當局先後通　擁護中央抗戰懲汪，港滬民衆團體及南洋各地僑胞亦已熱烈電擁國府及蔣委員長，澈底　奸堅持抗戰，我駐英法大使亦相率痛斥×奸無恥造謠，不過×奸陰謀活動通及各地，大家更應立志自勵，協助政府，從自己周圍開始，淸除勝利途上的這些障碍！</p>

<p>加拿大皇家銀行十二月期報吿云：新近宣佈之美加商約及央美商約，實可令人想見彼此商業關係之重大，美國與加拿大初於一九三五年十一月間，訂有商約，於翌年一月輸日施行，期訂三年，在此三年中，兩國商業頗受刺激，舊約期滿，更訂新約，該新約之訂立，足使兩國商務益　發達，可預期他。</p>
<p>根據美國官方統計，一九三五年加拿大對美輸出，爲二八六百萬美元，對美輸入爲三二三百萬美元，故美之出超爲三七百萬美元，一九三六年，卽美加商約施行之第一年，加拿大出口貿易增加至三七六萬美元，蓋是年美國早荒爲災，致使加麥，牲畜，及其他農產品，輸美激增，尙有木材等工業用品，輸出亦見大增，尤以英屬哥倫比亞爲甚，同時對加輸出，亦見增進，惟爲數不鉅，是年輸加總額，爲美金三八四百萬美元，故兩國輸出額幾乎相等相差僅爲美金八百萬元，翌年一九三七年，美對加輸出，較上年爲大增，總數達五一〇百萬美元，計增加一二六百萬元，加拿大之輸出則爲三九九百萬元，計增加二三百萬元，是年美對加　爲一一一百萬元，此在上年則僅八百萬元耳，厥後美國商業衰落，復因農產豐收，遂使加貨輸美，一落千丈，是項趨勢，迄於一九三八年猶然，在一九三八年首八月間，加拿大產品輸美降至一六二有萬元，此在上年同期，則爲二七九百萬元，而另一方面，美貨輸加，仍維持其良好狀態，計三二三百萬元，此在上年同期，則爲三三六百萬元，是故一九三八年度，美對加出超，達一六一百萬元。</p>
<p>美加兩國間之通商，各佔對外貿易上之重要地位，　則，試觀一九三〇年度，美加兩國輸出總額，合計在美金一百萬元以上，其中美加輸出爲六五九百萬元，而加國對美輸出爲四）二百萬元，當美國商業衰落之數年間，兩國貿易亦見激滅。惟自一九三〇至三八之九年間，兩國輸出總額，約爲六五〇百萬元，其間美對加輸出　三七五百萬元，而加對美輸出爲二七五百萬元，由是觀之，在美國全部對外貿易額量中，加拿大實居其輸出額之七分之一，而在美國全部出超額言之，對　單獨出超，約一百萬元，佔全部出超額之四分之一。其次爲美國對英之貿易，其總額雖不逮對加貿易之鉅，但自一九三零至三八年間，每年平均總額，為美金五六九百萬元，其中美對英輸出爲美金四六百萬元。英對美輸出爲一四一百萬元，美對英輸出最大部份，當推原棉，舉例以明之，一九三七年七月至一九三八年七月之一年中，英國講買美棉價値達八五百萬元，蓋已超過世界任何國家向美購棉數量兩倍以上。（法居第二位爲四〇百　元）在過去九年間，　對英貿易出超。每年半均爲二八七百萬元，夫英之爲大量入超國。世固知之矣，但不謂入超數量中，美貨實佔大部份，則恐未爲世人所盡知耳。</p>
<p>上述九年間，美之全部輸出額，每年平均爲三八百萬元，在此數字內，美對加輸出幾近一〇〇百萬元，而對英〇出則達二八七萬元，由是言之，九年以來，美對外貿易，年年出超，可謂純由兩國所造成。</p>
<p>雖然就貿易狀况言之，美加擔負固極重大，但就另一方而言之，美人游歷加拿大者　衆，費用浩繁，轉使加拿大對美收支之平衡，較爲有利，故如將此　「由遊歷造成貿易」併算在內，則自一九三一年始，美購加貨，年較加購美貨爲夥，同一例也，美國支付國之輪資，保險費等，爲數亦鉅，故就兩國最後總結論之，英國商業狀况，較之單就出口貿易估計所得者，良好多矣。</p>
<p>近世各國，皆視各該出口貿易之多寡，以　進口數量之增減，故貿易收支平衡，關係持重，苟世界非爲今日之世界，而爲理想的世界，不受關稅政策及其他商業限制之牽掣，則按經濟原理，一國之購貨，必購諸於物價最低之市場，其售貨也，亦必沽諸於物價最高之市塲，故一國縱有收支之失衛，亦無關於宏旨，何則，其他多　的相互關係，迅可將其餘漏補償；有以使然也，然在國家主義支配商業政策之下，此一問題，遂更顯其嚴重，英帝國每次會議之際，英國各部，均引領欲得令國市場之更多分配，然阿根鐵那、瑞典，挪威諸國，皆爲英貨之大量購買者，故英國在支配其布國各部數　時，對茲救國，亦不容忽視，而英國吸收世界各國出口額，旣如此之大且組，故其帝國各部以及其他各國，均已予以重大讓步，俾獲再其對英之優先輸入，是故英苟欲繼續收買美之過剩產品，則他國輪入之限量，必愈益狹隘，殆爲不可避免者焉。</p>
<p>英國向外投資，數額龐大，故英於若干年前，固已認貿易入超，爲屬必須，蓋向外購進貨物，可便他國覆行　付其投資應得之利益，由於是項讓步，英國得到借款利益，確較他國爲優，新興國家，資源類多不充。故在商業疲　之時，負維持世界金融安定之責者，其必資源充裕之諸先進國乎，各國對國　貿易，苟能善意扶　，不加限制，不以入超介於意，任　自由進出，則必能使當前世界困難大爲減少，其結果必可使新興諸國繼續履行淸償債務義務。英國在此期內，始終居於大量入超國地位。而不介意，其卡有造於世界商業之復興，功固非淺，然而世界商業之恢復，終必使英國內外貿易同　其利，而獲得進步者焉。</p>

<h3 id="c51">論英國對遠東應採的政策 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>據海通社倫敦電傳，英商對於日軍閥所擬實施的所謂「建設東亞新秩序」，甚感焦慮，蓋日本此舉實際上只是籍口排斥第三國在華權益，以遂其獨佔東亞而己。英國著名商業家李氏於前天在倫敦「泰晤士報」投函謂：「已往在滿洲事件發生時，日本至少在理論上，尚容許門戶開放政策與九國公約之存在，今於其建立遠東「新秩序」之計劃中，則已將其抹煞……」繼又歷舉日本吞併「滿洲」以後，英國貿易被排斥，竟減至百分之一以下。此外「每日電訊報」也刊一文，對於日本實行東亞門羅主義，損害西方列强的利益，表示憤懣。我們認爲英商這種焦慮極爲正確，而他們對日本這種企圖認識也極其淸楚，倘非身受之者，也許不會感到那樣痛切吧。</p>
<p>最近英美因鑒於日本軍閥企圖破壞國際公約及獨佔亞洲，勢在必行，已無「懸崕勒馬」的悔悟之心，所以兩國决心共同貸予中國欵項，使我們於交通建設和抗戰方面獲得不少的助力，而於精神上的鼓勵尤多。此種義舉，處於今日艱危險阻的抗戰過程中的中國人民固然表示無限的謝忱，可是爲世界和平與列强尤其英國在遠東的領土和利益計，無論從任何方面看，英國對遠東的政策實有更進一步，更加積極的必要。最近美國對日的政策，一方面因受輿論的督促，他方面則應該國商家的要求，已由不千涉而逐漸採取積極和强硬的步驟了。去年十月六日美政府對日本提出語調强硬照會，其原因就是在此。日本於去年十一月十八日致美國的覆牒，極盡其强詞奪理之能事，美政府認為不滿，於上月卅一日又致日本照會，重申美國政府的意見。該照會對於日本排斥美僑的事業，置日人於優越地位以及違背某數種國際公約，均一一加以駁斥，而於日本所擬施行的所謂「適應東亞新情勢」和「建設東亞新秩序」特別表示不能承認，且行將表現於實際行動上，據聞第七十六屆議會對這個問題將加以討論。美國準備對日制裁似巳到了相當的成熟階段。</p>
<p>美國對遠東局勢旣然抱着這樣的决心，英國在亞洲業已有百年的悠久歷史，而其所擁有的權益又數倍於美國，倘能趁此機會，更進一步與美國及其他民主國家如蘇法密切合作，採取强硬政策，對暴日迅速地加以制裁，則不特大英帝國在華的權益免受損害，且可使戰爭早告結束，中國許多無辜的人民也得免慘死於日軍閥殘暴的飛機大砲之下！</p>
<p>按自一九三五年十一月李滋羅斯帮助我國改革幣制之後，中英經濟便發生了此較過去更加密切的關係，而英國對華投贅也與日俱增，年來中國的鐵路建設的資本，當推英國的投贅爲第一位。在貿易方面，一九三六年卽中日戰爭爆發前的一年，英本國及其主要殖民地對華輸出佔中國輸入總數百分之二一·六二，由華輸人者佔中國全部輸出的百分之三一·八七：輸出入合計佔中國對外貿易的百分之二六·零一，與美日比較起來，英國佔着第一位。美國次之，日本則居於第三位。就是戰事發生後，至一九三八年上半年，英國對華的貿易仍居第一位。至於全中國銀行資本七十六萬萬的百分之八十，工業資本百分之六十乃在英國勢力之下的上海，據一九三六年的統計，英國在中國的海岸及內河的海運力量也居於首位，較諸日本多了兩倍餘。但自日本發動侵略戰以來，致去年上半年，英國的運輸力量逐漸減少至四分之一以下了。武漢和廣州失守以後，英國在華的勢力幾乎被日本驅逐凈盡，香港損失之大更不待言。近來日軍閥更復變本加厲，藉口軍事關係，封鎖長江和珠江，不許外輪航行，用盡所有的卑劣手段，排斥外商經營事業，所有佔領地外人一切旅行居住均受種種限限，務使其斷絕足跡而後快。假使今日中國的淪陷區域，日軍閥能够永久佔得住的話，則任何地方都不許外人有活動的餘地呢！英國商家的反對日軍閥所提倡的欺人的「新秩序」，主張採取强硬政策，實爲適當之舉。</p>
<p>瘋狂的法西斯主義者平沼麒一郎代替近衛而上台了，今後日軍凞在這最後掙扎的階段中，其對華侵畧戰會更加緊張而殘酷，而對於外人的利益的排斥也會更加積極。實際上首當其衝的自然是英美，尤其是在華擁有權益最多的英國，昨日日本「都新聞一，已經悍然表示：不問美國如何反對，不問英美如何採取合作方法，日本政府決仍堅持其樹立東亞新秩序的決意。「讀賣新聞」亦有同樣言論，說日本今後仍本其决意，向組織「日滿支經濟集團」之途邁進，並且表明平沼內閣對外第一聲，卽將是斷然拒絕美國上月卅一日的照會。日本在遠東發展與英美權益的絕不相容，已經明若觀火。四日美總統羅斯福在議會演詞，似暗示美國將對日德實施經濟制裁，全美制裁日本運動更為熱烈。美國旣準備予乂日以嚴厲的制裁，倘英國×××××××××××，法國必能參加，至於平素倡導和平的蘇聯更無置身事外之理。如是不牯英國在東方的權益可得保障，而世界和平也可重新樹立了。是時候了，賢明的英國政治家諒早已有「成竹在胸」吧！</p>

<p>這樣的質問，我們到處　着。這在剛剛離開滿城難民，哀鴻　野的　州；一日數次警報，而痛心疾首的悟州，柳州的我們看來，無異晴大霹靂。可恨傳者，若有其事，不管你怎樣地說明，然而妥協，和平的空氣仍然鐵罩着桂林的人心。飽食終日，而私心希望『和平」之徒。成爲散佈謠言的播音機，甚且把『和平」的條件；第一第二……第五都說出來了。「和平」不是我方單獨希望的，騎虎難下的×人　在希望。他們　出「知此知彼」的口吻。什麼某處長已得密報，證實謠言非訛，某要人已經停止遷鄕的預定；某長在紀念週中，也有「和平」將出現的暗示等等·他們用盡力量，舉出廣州武漢相繼失陷之後，「和平」必然到來的根據，一傳十，十　百·一若「萬事已定」的樣子。在這樣氛圍氣中，素以爲對時事認識較深者，也不免爲其所蒙蔽，進而發生動搖。形成整個桂林陷入　　的深淵中。我們認爲這在第二期抗戰，方在開始的今天·是絕對不容發生的現象，更不春發生在未來抗戰的根據地的桂林，所以我們盡力之所及，對謠言加以解說和糾正·連日來我們存對個人談話，社團機關的訪問·以及和公務人員的會見中，都莫不强調下記讀點。藉以說明我方，必能堅持抗戰到底，而且只有抗戰到底，才能獲得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>第一，妥　足以亡國——在目前各種形勢下·任何和平談判，我方絕無有利可言×人自以爲得勝，必置我方於「城下盟」的地位·實際上勝敗之分，此刻尚非决定的時期。而且今日的結果，早在抗戰前的意料之中，爲抗戰中必有的過程。我們不惜任伺犧牲，，毅然　戰，爲的是國家的獨立，與民挨的復與，在未達到此項目的以前，絕不能停止抗戰的行動，一年半來的事實，雖然我們有很多損失，然而愈打愈强，士氣之盛，爲往昔所未有，民族復興，已露端倪，今日如可妥協，便無抗戰之事發生。誰不明白，此次我們的抗戰，是死　求生，妥協無異放秦唯一的生路，而趨死地。又誰不明白，×人的內在矛盾，困離等等，要在我們繼續抗戰中，不斷地表露出來。這便足使我們毅然看開「中途妥協，足以亡國」的道路，而積極地執行長期抗戰的使命。</p>
<p>第二，失敗主義者未盡剷除——樹無風不動，「和平」的謠言，當然也不是憑空而來。因爲我們的陣營裏尚有失敗主義者的存在，我們的要員，學者中間，還有人未肯放案「和平」的幻想。這就是「和平」妥協的滋生地，不過這些失敗主義者起初就企圖「和平」的·因爲抵不住抗×救亡的洪流，就是說，客觀形勢，都趨向抗戰，郎明白非抗戰不足以立　，不足以　存，所以失敗主義者的主和，終沒有得　其巧的機會。目前的客觀形勢，不僅與抗戰前途沒有發生絲亳的變化，反而加强了抗戰的要求，加以各黨各派能更精誠合作，民衆間，民族意識飛躍地增高，凡此在在均足以給主和者以重大的打擊。所以我們說主和者雖仍然在　動着，妥協的危機，容許還未根本地剷除，但抗戰的客觀形勢，尚未減少，妥協絕對不可能。</p>
<p>第三，勝利的曙光微露着，我們在這抗戰的一年餘中，學習了一切不僅軍事上對×人作戰的戰略，已有長足的進步。政治上有了逐漸昌明的朕兆，卽對內也朋白了誰是愛國誰是賣國，腐壤份子，逐被淘汰，抗戰志士，漸有其用武之地，這些都是勝利的預言，雖然，我們還有許多不容實恕的弱點，但，大家已經能認識它。而且逐漸在剷除，逐漸在改善，却是事實，我們的力量，是無窮大的·現在我們已經漸漸學會運用這力量的技術了。大家都明白抗戰勝利唯一的條件，全視能否完成總動員的使命爲斷，可是這個最困雜的總動員的工作，已經是在積極努力着，而且必有收獲的。</p>
<p>我們根據許多事實，引証了最高領袖的言論，證實廣漢相繼失陷之後，我方必然積續抗戰，而且無碍於抗戰勝利的條件。在這裏，我們要特別指出的，就是桂林的廣西日報亦能發揮具領導輿論，糾正謠言的使命。記得是十一月八日（？）罷，該報社論，正正皇皇地發表了一篇「肅淸失敗主義者」的文章，內容歷陳抗戰到底必獲最後勝利的事實，結論指出；舞知民衆，誤倩謠言，自尋苦惱，尚可原諒，身爲公務人員，甚至負領導地位者·竟對抗戰前途，發生搖動，不僅說明其缺乏常識，其影響人心，實罪不容誅云云·我們佩服該報立論正確，有深遠的眼光。然而由該報所指摘的事實看來，足見桂林當時的「和平」空氣，如何濃厚，以及誤信謠言者，大有人在。</p>
<p>事實勝雄辨，謠言終於不能逃出謠言的範圍半步·蔣委員長告國民書，參政會的决議，有如陽光般把矇蔽在桂林的「和平」霧氣，掃散殆盡。尤其是　主席由長沙歸來（當時桂林盛傳黃主席出席的長沙會議·卽在於决定和戰的問題）「和平」空氣，立消於九霄雲外了。後來從衡陽方面來桂林的人，越來越多。我們從黃主席及許多人口中，得悉了長沙會議，决定第二期抗戰的新戰略的消息。據說，我方此次决定抗戰到底的根據，重要的有三，（一）×人的戰鬥力量，日見衰退，從上海南京，徐州，漢口等戰場的統計看來，幾成爲遞　的下落線，反之，我方却逐漸增加，而且過去未曾參戰，而一味在養精蓄銳的某軍，决定參戰，所以在抗抵或反攻—，都有把握：（二）軍需品的供給方面，雖然因爲國際路綫，發生了變化和困難，但我方所得的軍用品，已照預定輸入了百分之七〇，足供若干年之用：（三）財政經濟，巳有解决的自信這不僅是對外援方面說，卽我方自己的力量，尚有許多開源節流的善策，於抗戰無碍；（四）國內團結更形密切，此次長沙會議，有八路軍的代表周恩來氏等參加，爲過去未有的現象。</p>
<p>上舉許多消息，是從可靠的人口中傳出，証實了我們的說明，堅定了抗戰的决心，桂林的空氣，由悲觀，消極，動搖，變成爲緊張，積極·鎮定，</p>
<p>省政府早就預糾　機襲桂的殘暴。除有組織地領導民衆避難外，幷决定疏散婦孺。加以岳陽方面，軍事異常吃緊，而駭人聽聞的長沙大火的　事，又在不久之間，相繼發生，持林自然免不了受巨大的震動，形成有秩序的動搖。表現出另一種非常的現象。</p>
<p>從衡陽方面，湧來的人羣，我們用「洪流」「人山人海」的字面，實不足以形容其萬一。接着在桂林市表現出來的，便是食和住的問題。</p>
<p>這座小小的桂林市，自從抗戰開始以後，新開的飯店有如春筍之生，加上舊有的，合共竟超出百的數目，這百餘家的大小飯店，不管你什麼時候閱進去，第一個印象就是客滿，有時候你僥倖找到一個坐位，不耐煩地：等了若干時間後，你所要的菜肴，陸續來了，第一碗飯吃完了，第二不是又要等若干時，便是得到這　的回答。飯還沒有…來不及…再等三十分鐘。」任你出了，大的代價，總不容易給你大飽一　，這是食的問題。至於宿的問題，也有同據的狀况·新設的旅館，不爲不多·然而到了晚上十一時，門總是緊緊閉着的·夜半兩三點鐘，從湘桂路湧來的客人，打破了拳頭，旅館主人，仍然是裝　子聾子。後來找，房子的人聽明了，在旅館門外，大叫某某先生，表示來找朋友的樣子，旅館主人把門一開，烽　血進，在帳房，在走馬樓在　所只要有一蓆空地，他們就展開自己的被褥睡下去，「你要多少錢，就給你多少」旅館主人的確是無法應付，幷目可以照自己的意思·開他一夜一圓二圓的租錢，也樂得再裝一次聾啞·一切的物品價格，比較戰前，據說不知道增加多少倍，然而這在旅客看來·是沒有問題的·只有苦了本地的窮人。</p>
<p>食住之外·在桂林不容易解决者，當爲交通問題。本地的人，早就明白·桂林的木屋，不堪燃燒，而且政府旣有疏散的决定·大家當然爭先離開桂林。從衡陽來的人們，除一極小部分，係留桂林工作外，大多數都是經過性質，弄得車少客多，交通成爲難以解决的嚴重問題。從各處流入桂林的人口·日以千計，但，從桂林開出的汽車·每日最多不出兩架，當然不能解决疏散的問題。據確實消息，從柳州赴貴陽的客票，已登記至明年三月。目的地在重慶，昆明的人們，旣非徒步所能解决，則只有在桂林住下了。這樣更加多了食住的困難。在馬路上不少因旅費告罄血徘徊着·至於向人乞憐者，也大有人在，雖然廣西當局，曾有收容維民的規定，及收容所的設立，但所能解决奢，僅問題之末梢耳。</p>
<p>最後，我們要指摘的，尚有許多嚴重而急待解决且極易解决的問題。</p>
<p>（一）食住問題之不易解决，在於沒有阻止或于涉各業主的居奇，而且許多公共機關，如會館，廟寺等，尚讓其空空，不加以利用。這是莫大的損失，如果能更有計劃地利用這些地方，同時分配旅館飯店的經營方式食住的問題，必可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>（二）像怪物般，從前方轍退後方的卡車·車前站着「軍甩」的大字，但所積戰的內容多數是沙發，木鉄傢私，皮箱以及屬桶之類。　說很多重要物品，他缺乏軍　，　運不出來，　積戰這些東西，實在令人痛心，以電油的價格非常高漲且缺貨的今日，積戰的傢私·實不及　油的代價。這種不合理的現象·須要有實者注意的。</p>
<p>（三）電油是非常高價且缺貨。節省電油，統制電油的呼聲，高入雲霄，但我們仍看着公子小姐們，坐車兜風。</p>
<p>（四）桂林的電油是非常缺乏的，且每罐賣價值國幣二十圓。有時有銀也買不着現貨，聽　龍州方面，有奐多的存貨，每罐僅賣八圓。但我們却看着許多空車，從龍州開回挂林，伺以不能利用具運油似補不足，這是一個嚴重的組織問題。電油不過是一個例子，其他物資俱有同樣的怪現欽。</p>
<p>五交通工具是非常缺乏的·然而汽車行，甚至官辦的路局，仍不免有舞弊的事發生，例如的從墟到　林。定價爲國幣六元七角，但有人竟出了國幣二十五元。據汽車票係先被人包去，留待高價賣出。因此，有的客人找不到費票的地方，雖願出高價，亦無從入手，居然在極其簡陋的小旅館中·住了七八天的，大有人在。可是在這乘客這樣擠擁的情形中，因上述舞弊的關係，竟讓車中存有空位駛出。這是發生在我們理想中的廣西的事實，聽說其他地方更是烏烟障氣這是不容不急速糾正的現象啊！</p>

<p>— 壯駒</p>
<p>【本報南昌特訊】抗戰以來，×人遭遇到偉大的殲滅，恐無過於南潯綫的戰役了。這是將士們不可磨滅的功動，同時也是抗戰史上光榮血重要的一頁。由九江至德安，全綫雖僅不過一百華里，在×人海陸空聯合猛攻之下，結果我們的英勇將士，竟能支持四個整月（由七月至十月），殲滅了×人十萬以上·幷俘獲無算。——這不能不說是殲滅戰偉大的成功，更不能不佩服前綫將官的指揮和韜略，我們决不能忘記繼台兒莊大勝的德安一役！</p>
<p>原來×人的企國，以奪取九江爲據點，然後大舉向南進攻，佔領南昌，逕出萍醴，金華，而威脅第二期抗戰的政治，經濟，文化重心的湖北，湖南，廣東，浙江諸省·因此，自七月五日起，×人卽開始向我進犯，但綁我軍節節抵抗，四月來的血戰。×人付了莫大的代價，而僅在南潯綫上佔得幾個小城市。尤其在十月卅日德安我軍撒退後，×因傷亡過重，顯巳無力再犯，是以兩月來修河南北兩岸，戰事均陷於膠着狀態，惟最近我軍經己佈置就緒，準備向×大舉反攻，預測一元復始，萬象更新之時，潯陽江頭，又是掩報頻傳了。記者隨軍數月，特搜集是役史料，作系統的報道，以告閱者：</p>
<p>九江一役轉入有利階段</p>
<p>九江位於江西之北，長江的中游，是軍事上必爭之地，×人於六月聞先後佔領馬當湖口後，便乘勢以陸海空的綜合威力進攻九江，以爲沿江西進，沿九瑚公路西進，沿南潯鐵路南進的據點。</p>
<p>然而，九江在軍事上雖很重要，但在地形上和我軍裝備上，却形成一個易攻難守的地區，她是一個三角的地帶，東北兩團環江傍湖，到處可以供×人利用登陸。而且我方旣無要塞的設備，又加上江中的封鎖綫，縱深不過十餘里，戰場全部均爲×海軍砲所控制，機動區域過小，部隊運用，倍增困難，因此我軍于取得相當代價後，九江不能不目動放棄了·</p>
<p>×人進攻九江，在七月五目卽已開始派遣艦艇，分赴南北水道鄱陽湖口等處，掃除水雷，破壤我封鎖綫，至中旬以後，逐漸增用飛機偵察和轟炸。但事實上，×人的掃雷，在畫間屢被我擊退，傷亡頗大，祇因我缺乏江湖守禦的設備，夜間來犯，深感困難，當廿三日的午夜，情勢突然緊張了，×檜羣集於鄱陽湖西岸，使用汽艇百餘艘，運送×兵數千，向姑塘以北的殷家湖强行登陸，我守備該處的部隊，當即迎頭痛擊，戰至大明×機出動協同作戰，×艦又作遮斷的射擊，陣地遂爲突破，惟當晚李漢魂將軍揮兵夜襲奪回塔頂山普　山之綫，斬×千餘，迨廿四廿五兩日，×又分頭竄至鴉雀山，八里坡以及廖家坂以南一帶，同時，×機艦向九江城猛烈森擊，城內中爽燒彈起火，秩序大亂，被×汽艇駛至洋油廠與馬廠湖兩處登陸，我軍以戰略關係，當晚奉令向馬迴嶺撤退，並在牛頭山，金官橋，十里山　林山各地，築成强固陣綫，從此我軍便轉人有利的新陣地。</p>
<p>屢變戰略　乂人依然失敗</p>
<p>馬迴嶺前後山陵起伏，南北都是狹長的谷地，一九二六年，張發奎將軍曾率領繆培南，吳奇偉，李漢魂等鐵軍將領，擊敗孫傳芳於此，現在李漢魂將軍捲土重來，自是輕車習熱了。主陳地帶，右面起自廬山西側的牛頭山，斜向西南·經金家山折趨西北，越鄧家河至十里山以西地區，就地勢而言，極於我有利：第一，連離江河，×海軍砲火失去射程的效力：第二，破壞公路，×戰車重砲不能運用；第三，大山環繞，森林密佈，×機無法發現轟炸目標，加以築有新式工事，更形成　鐵般的防禦綫，在這圓陣地上，李漢魂將軍整整守了一個月，殲滅了×乒二萬餘名，消耗×彈藥槍械等物二萬萬元以上，是我抗戰以來攻防戰的最大收獲·</p>
<p>八月初，×以安微偽保安隊編成的一〇六師團，九十師團，及二十師團，一〇一師團的一部總計兵力約八萬餘，由一〇六師團長松浦爲總指揮官，　用×權協助，大舉向我猛攻，從二日至五日節節對我兩翼壓迫，右翼王大腦，牛頭山，老虎山，左翼肖家墩，大天山，十里山，馬頭山等陣地，經數度與×展開爭奪戰，統計×傷亡二千餘，被我生擒中尉一名，　獲大損權彈，價值十餘萬元。×以犯我兩翼傷亡過重，老羞成怒，五日竟向我河洲上陣地，一連轟擊數白發毒氣砲彈·我軍傷亡頗衆，六日以後，連日以密集砲火掩護，步兵重施中央突破的故技，向金官橋前進；同時又分兵屢犯左翼大天山陳家墩高地·經變方劇烈搏鬥，陣地央而復得數次，我陳公俠師，饒勇善戰，向×猛衝，遂將×人中央突破的　計粉碎無遺，但我團長張澤深於此役亦不幸而負傷了。至廿六日，×增援源源趨至，補充漸已就緒，復以飛機大砲掩議步隊向我全綫猛攻，戰事又轉激烈，變方傷亡各數千人；第因左友軍被×人突破，×得以沿埔總大這進抵山，迂還我軍側背，在九月二日，其先頭部隊進至和尚　，槐樹義，此時我軍有四面被×包圍的形勢，於是從容向德安附近撤退。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Travelogue of Tianjin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Dispatch] This reporter took the Fusheng steamer to Tianjin on the 28th of last month. Due to delays en route, we didn't arrive in Tanggu until the 8th. According to what I knew in Shanghai, in addition to the Taikoo Steamship Navigation Company ships, Jardine Matheson's passenger and cargo ships traveling from Shanghai to Tianjin could directly enter Tianjin. However, this has recently changed completely. All ships traveling north from Shanghai and Hong Kong must dock at Tanggu. All passengers must first undergo various inspections, registrations, and epidemic prevention procedures. Then, the Tanggu-based [illegible characters] military police and special agencies conduct a unified inspection, searching everyone thoroughly and meticulously. They rigorously question the passengers' backgrounds and occupations and are particularly attentive to the cash they carry, restricting each person to 500 yuan. This type of inspection was once implemented when Qingdao was connected to Tanggu. However, it seems that no large sums were confiscated on the ship I took. Tanggu is the only port of entry in North China, so [illegible characters] authorities are quite strict in their defense of the area. The two major alkali refineries and chemical companies, Jiuda and Yongli, are now entirely controlled by [illegible characters] merchants, operating on a large scale, producing large quantities, and generating significant profits. After passing inspection in Tanggu and being deemed without suspicion, one can purchase a train ticket to Tianjin. The journey from Tanggu to Tianjin Station takes only fifty minutes. Although inspections also occur at Tianjin Station, they are slightly more enthusiastic. The area near Tianjin East Station has changed significantly. Many businesses have been replaced by [illegible characters] merchants, presenting a different atmosphere. Even rickshaw pullers now wear green military-style caps. Reportedly, they have also been completely integrated under large-scale capital and are subject to unified management. They pay a monthly rental fee of four or five yuan, plus a deposit of several tens of yuan, to operate. Otherwise, they cannot solicit business. The French Concession in Tianjin is particularly prosperous. The area around Lishan and Tianzeng Lane has seen extreme commercial development and bustling activity. Various ethnic restaurants are full, with profits tripling. After arriving in Tianjin, I rested briefly and then ventured out with a friend to the Chinese districts and [illegible characters] Concessions. I then learned that the [illegible characters] Concession no longer has the bustle of yesteryear. During the incidents, most of the Chinese residents evacuated and have not yet returned. The [illegible characters] Concession authorities have cleared the area, with many residents moving out. The two most famous opium dens, Deyilou and Xinlu Inn, have moved entirely to the Chinese districts. As for the "human flesh markets" in Zhongxiao Lane and Yude Lane, they have closed due to lack of customers. Therefore, apart from a few Chinese shops established by [illegible characters], the remaining businesses in the [illegible characters] Concession are mostly [illegible characters] shops, foreign firms, and especially various military and political organizations. Zhongyuan Company has ceased operations, and there are very few pedestrians on [illegible characters] Street. Many of the buildings on the streets have been rebuilt in the Japanese style, creating a [illegible characters] Japanese island atmosphere. All intersections from the [illegible characters] Concession to the Mongolian Concession are blocked, with only one exit at the southeastern corner of the city, where pedestrians are inspected at all times to prevent accidents. The "three-no-zone" [areas where no law is enforced] in the [Japanese] Concession has returned to its usual prosperity, with opium dens, brothels, teahouses, and wine shops everywhere. Tourists are like [illegible characters], bustling and extremely lively. Dongma Road remains largely unchanged, and while business is not booming, it is still manageable. The area around Dahu Lane is slightly deserted. The area near Beima Road has always had old-fashioned shops, so there have been no changes. However, opium dens are thriving, everywhere. Sales are very brisk, and goods are sourced publicly, with the payment of unified taxes listed as a legitimate business expense. Other areas in the Chinese districts are very desolate. Residents close their doors early at night, afraid to go out. Most Tianjin newspapers rely on Tongfeng News Agency for news. Schools have mostly reopened, but there are fewer students than in the past. However, the number of schools in the British and French Concessions has increased several times over.</p>

<p>The China Prince, a ship of the Taizi Yanghang [Prince Merchant House] Shipping Company, was originally scheduled to sail to Xiaoluzong [Luzon, Philippines], along the route to Bird Island, Boston, and other places today. However, due to [illegible characters], the departure had to be postponed to tomorrow. According to inquiries, this voyage will first pass through Xigong [Saigon], but will carry goods from Saigon. In addition, the large timber and [illegible characters] powder, totaling several thousand tons, transported by the Siluhua Sida [Shell-Smit] ship, an agent of the company, have now been completely unloaded. The ship entered the Kowloon Dockyard for repairs this morning.</p>
<p>The Xianduo Ya [Santo Andreas], a ship of the Taikoo Yan Yan Tong [Taikoo Godown &amp; Agency Co.] has arrived in Hong Kong from Xiaoluzong and has been in the Taikoo Dockyard for repairs for nearly a month.

<p>The Zhennabo [Jean Laborde], a ship of the French Postal Shipping Company, arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai yesterday. It is scheduled to berth at the Kowloon Wharf at 7:00 AM this morning and depart for Xigong [Saigon], Shilak [Malacca], and other places at 3:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>The [illegible characters] President [President Grant], a ship of the American President Lines, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday via Japan from England. It was delayed by two days according to the schedule, but it is expected to arrive at 7:00 AM this morning and berth at Kowloon [illegible characters]. It will depart for Xiaoluzong [Luzon, Philippines], Xingjiapo [Singapore], various European possessions, and the United States at 1:00 PM the same afternoon.</p>
<p>The Kelifulan President [President Cleveland] arrived in Hong Kong via Japan from San Francisco. It is also expected to arrive this morning and depart for Xiaoluzong [Luzon, Philippines] at 5:00 PM this afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Talking About the Automobile Transport Industry <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Zuze</p>
<p>The American automobile transport industry has been around for twenty years since its inception. Although it is shorter than the history of other businesses, its development [illegible characters] has surpassed other transport industries to take the lead. According to reliable estimates, the total number of transport automobiles in the United States now stands at a huge number of 568,000, employing approximately one million people, which is even more than the number of railway transport workers in the United States. This shows the scale of this industry.</p>
<p>The automobile transport industry can be divided into two types: long-distance and short-distance. Long-distance can reach up to 700 miles, and there are several routes in the western United States around 1,000 miles. Under certain circumstances, the driving conditions are quite satisfactory. Regardless of long-distance or short-distance transportation companies, their business methods can generally be divided into two types: one is to sign contracts and fix prices periodically, and the other is to have fixed prices and fixed deliveries. To meet the needs of modern cities, the automobile transport industry is more likely to develop. The arrival or departure of ships and trains all require automobiles for transfer. The timely distribution of food, the distribution of industrial products, the demolition and construction of buildings, and the movement of large objects cannot be done without transport automobiles. Automobile transport has now exceeded railway transport, with the proportion being approximately 46% for railway freight and 54% for automobile freight. In particular, short-distance freight within 210 miles is thriving, with an eightfold increase compared to long-distance freight.</p>
<p>In the United States, long-distance automobile transport companies with routes over 250 miles have a large scale, and cargo handling follows railway methods. Even with a large number of vehicles, they can still make a profit. Some commentators say that large-scale companies are not very suitable for operating long-distance transport.</p>
<p>There are various reasons why automobile transport is so popular and developed so much. According to 35,468 businesses, the following can be listed:</p>
<p>Reasons　Percentage of Customers</p>
<p>Fast Transportation ...... 65</p>
<p>Can Deliver Directly to the Store ...... 65</p>
<p>Low Total Transportation Cost ...... 53</p>
<p>Can Load and Unload at the Store ...... 51</p>
<p>More Flexible and Convenient ...... 43</p>
<p>Cheaper Packaging ...... 21</p>
<p>Shorter Reporting Time ...... 21</p>
<p>Simpler Freight Classification ...... 16</p>
<p>Fewer Lost and Damaged Goods ...... 11</p>
<p>Personal Friendship and Interest ...... 3</p>
<p>From the above table, it is clear that most people welcome automobile transport because of its speed. According to statistics, the speed of automobile transport averages 15 miles per hour, compared to 5 miles for railways, 3 to 10 miles for waterways, and 1 to 5 miles for pipeline transport (the crude oil produced by American kerosene [illegible characters] is mostly transported to distant refineries by giant pipes). From this, it can be seen that the speed of automobile transport is three times faster than that of railways.</p>
<p>Another advantage of automobile transport is that the choice of route endpoints is not subject to [illegible characters] restrictions like railways or harbors. On the contrary, its endpoints are extremely flexible and extensible. As for the endpoints of large companies' automobile routes, there are also facilities such as driver dormitories, management offices, and repair shops.</p>
<p>In ordinary-style transport automobiles, the driver's position is about three feet behind the front of the car. Today's new-style transport automobiles have a high front, with the driver's position directly under the engine. This provides a broad and distant view, allowing the driver to be prepared for operation even in crowded downtown areas. Secondly, the cargo space is at least three feet longer than the old style. Thirdly, the weight of the load is evenly distributed on the front and rear vehicles, resulting in more economical driving.</p>
<p>The use of trailers in automobile transport is also gradually increasing. There are many benefits to using trailers. When the trailer is loading and unloading cargo, the truck can tow another trailer or drive to the repair shop for repairs, without interfering with the loading and unloading of cargo. Today's trailers are also very well-made. The mechanism for connecting them to the truck is extremely [illegible characters], even allowing the driver to automatically disconnect the trailer without getting out of the car. There is also a type of semi-trailer (the rear half of the trailer is equipped with wheels, and the front half is braced on the rear axle of the truck. After detaching from the truck, it can stand stably on the ground with its half-installed landing gear). Because it can be towed by small horsepower trucks, their number is also very large, especially suitable for driving on flat ground, which can greatly increase the load. The safety equipment of new semi-trailers is most commendable. Even if it accidentally detaches from the truck during driving, [illegible characters] the landing gear automatically lowers and stops automatically, avoiding the danger of overturning or collision.</p>
<p>"The American automobile transport industry's quick look at the business accounts and the materials for its cost calculation is quite difficult to obtain, [illegible characters] because the companies do not keep detailed accounts. Some are too busy to keep accounts and simply do not, while others only calculate the total annual income and expenses, and only conclude with some surplus. As for the accounting of large-scale companies, although it is more detailed, it is still insufficient in terms of classification and statistics. Therefore, it is difficult to investigate which vehicle parts are beneficial and which are uneconomical, so as to have a standard for future choices. Therefore, the figures listed in this article can only be used for reference and cannot be taken as the whole picture.</p>
<p>A large automobile transport company used a gasoline engine truck to drive on a 200-mile route, covering a total of 80,000 miles throughout the year. Each trip carried 20 tons, costing a total of $17,493, which is approximately 22 cents per mile. Another similar truck drove on a 400-mile route, covering a total of 96,000 miles throughout the year, costing a total of $19,657, which is approximately less than 22 cents per mile.</p>
<p>According to a survey in California, the gasoline consumption of highway transport automobiles can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>Load　Annual Mileage　Miles per Gallon (Note)</p>
<p>Under 3,000 Pounds　9,300 Miles　14.35</p>
<p>3,000 to 5,999 Pounds　9,000 Miles　11.46</p>
<p>6,000 to 7,000 Pounds　4,800 Miles　8.10</p>
<p>Over 10,000 Pounds　9,600 Miles　5.07</p>
<p>(Note) This is an American gallon, approximately four-fifths of a British gallon, or 3.75 liters.</p>
<p>The numbers listed in the above table cannot be compared to long-distance travel because the routes are limited to California.</p>
<p>Some statistics even attempt to prove that automobile transport is more expensive than railway transport over a certain mileage, but they also do not deny that automobile transport is more economical for distances of 250 to 300 miles. However, long-distance automobile transport businesses of 700 to 1,000 miles are now thriving.</p>
<p>The taxes collected by the American government from the automobile transport industry each year will certainly exceed $1 billion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1935, there were only 61,276 transport automobile companies with 188,809 trucks, and they had already collected $53,086,000 in taxes. The total number of vehicles only accounted for one-third of this year.</p>
<p>In short, although the American automobile transport industry is under the pressure of heavy taxes and strong competition from railway counterparts, its contribution has been very significant, such as reducing unemployment, promoting traffic convenience, and indirectly promoting the progress of automobile engineering, all of which cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Monopolizing the Cigarette Market Again</p>
<p>The Chinese cigarette market, with the exception of the considerable share held by Chinese merchants, is controlled by Anglo-American capital. However, this was the pre-war state of affairs. Since August 13th, Japanese merchants, who had no position in the Chinese tobacco market, have jumped to a position of [illegible characters] great strength. Anglo-American tobacco companies and South China tobacco factories are forced to be confined to small concession areas. The vast markets in the guerrilla zone cities are all occupied by Japanese tobacco, controlled by the three major companies of "Dongya Tobacco," "Manzhou Tobacco," and "Dong [illegible characters] Leaf Tobacco."</p>
<p>[Dongya Tobacco Company] After the September 18th Incident, it controlled the tobacco market in the four northeastern provinces. After the fall of North China, it expanded its influence into the interior. Now, it has [illegible characters] militarily arrived in the Yangtze River basin and has successively deployed its control network as follows:</p>
<p>Control Network</p>

<p>In light of the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, the British authorities have decided to strengthen the British military presence in the Far East. Last month, Major General Doubig, Commander of British Forces in Malaya, announced this plan. Yesterday, the Asian Army Headquarters announced that it would [illegible character] troops to defend Bili [Penang]. The number of troops has not yet been announced, as the location serves as the gateway to the Xuezhou [Australia] naval base, where the British [illegible character] Pacific Fleet will be stationed in the future. In addition to the current fleet stationed in Hong Kong, the fleet will add at least two capital ships and one aircraft carrier. The British military has also decided to increase troop deployment to Hong Kong by six regiments. Once the Kowloon barracks are completed, the troops will depart from Britain and arrive in Hong Kong. The construction cost of the Kowloon barracks is said to be HK$20 million.</p>
<p>In addition, [illegible characters] Major General Baddowme replaced Major General McNessey as Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in China. Major General McNessey arrived in Hong Kong and took office two months ago. To inspect the British troops stationed in various parts of China, McNessey, along with his adjutant John, departed from Hong Kong yesterday morning (6th) aboard the British mail ship Laportana for Shanghai. After inspecting the local British troops, he will continue to Tianjin for inspection. He is expected to return to Hong Kong at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Circles, the Relief Group of the Society for the Relief of Refugees from South China, held its fourth meeting at Tung Wah Hospital last night. Attendees included Lin Zengsheng of Tung Wah Hospital, Xie Huixiang of the Dongguan Chamber of Commerce, Zhou, Lu Shao of the China Youth Red Cross, Fan Luqiu of the Confucian Society, Xu Xizhe of the Huiyang Youth Association, Xi Xiuzhen of the War Relief Association, Chen Yingpei of the Comforting Association, Shan Dexin of the Young Women's Christian Association, and Liang Ruikun of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association. Li Youlin served as chairman, and Huang Shuming as the recorder.</p>
<p>Surveying Land to Build Shelters in Preparation</p>
<p>The chairman reported to the public that since the association had received the order to relocate refugees in the New Territories, the work was nearing completion. The issues of drinking water and lighting had been resolved and were being managed by Gao Naibo, so there was no need to worry. Some stations had been relocated to Shenzhen, including Sheung Shui, Man Kam To, Ha Tsuen, Lok Ma Chau, and San Tin. The relocation had already begun today (yesterday). It was estimated that while there were no fewer than three or four thousand refugees in Lok Ma Chau, only about twenty were willing to move. Regarding the safety of refugees in Shenzhen, the Hong Kong government was extremely concerned and had verbally notified Zhou Zhaowu, the chairman of Tung Wah Hospital, to survey a central location in the New Territories in advance to build temporary shelters. This was to prepare a place for refugees from the Hua Jie Shenzhen area to stay when they fled to Hong Kong in the event of war. At this time, the government already had this kind of preparation plan, so when refugees from Shenzhen came again, they could stay there. Other refugees on the New Territories border could also get a place, so they would not be as displaced and destitute as the refugees in the New Territories a month ago, exposed to the cold wind in the mountains and wilderness.</p>
<p>Relocation of Each Station: Three-Day Notice</p>
<p>Then began the discussion regarding Chen Xianxuan of Sheng Sheng Farm in Lok Ma Chau, whose enthusiastic efforts in providing relief to refugees this time. All representatives unanimously agreed that a letter of thanks should be sent to Chen in the name of the assembly. In addition, regarding the Huiyang Youth Association's request for reimbursement of the meal and transportation expenses for its New Territories service personnel, and for the purchase of equipment, totaling more than one hundred and ten yuan, it was resolved that the amount should be returned in full. The relocation of the Yuen Long station was originally scheduled for the fourth of this month, but was delayed due to the delays in the relocation of each station. The relocation of this station will not be scheduled for a specific date in the future, but a three-day notice will be given before the relocation. The public unanimously agreed to pass it. As for the remaining stations that have not been relocated, all new equipment must be clearly calculated and handed over to the relief group one day before the relocation so that it can be declared to customs. The meeting adjourned at nine o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Vietnamese Merchant Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss the Course of Vietnam's Ban on Arms Shipments to China. XX Threatens France to Cut Off Our International Transportation. The French Have Slightly Modified the Ban After Our Negotiations <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Some time ago, the French government authorities issued an order prohibiting all military supplies and similar military supplies from being imported into the mainland from Vietnam. The reason for this has not been lifted until now and what the reason is is quite desirable for the outside world to know. According to a merchant who arrived in Hong Kong from Vietnam yesterday, he was specifically asked about it, and he agreed to tell the following what he knew. According to a certain merchant, in order to step up the blockade of our country's coastal and inland international routes to cut off our country's foreign aid, XX made a threat to France some time ago, stating that if Haiphong continued to transport arms to China, they would occupy Hainan Island and bomb the Yunnan-Vietnam railway to intimidate them. The policy of the current French Daladier cabinet is quite close to that of the British Chamberlain cabinet of today's realism, so under this only form, in order to take care of the safety of Vietnam (XX's occupation of Hainan can directly hinder the safety of Vietnam) and France's interests in the Far East, the ban was issued.</p>
<p>Embargo on Military Supplies</p>
<p>In the past, our country's government, in order to fight the Southwest war, urgently needed to develop, and transportation urgently needed assistance. In order to open up the Southwest International Route, officials were repeatedly sent to the line to propose negotiations. At the same time, the French side was also extremely reluctant to issue the ban, so after our country negotiated on the basis of reason, the ban has been slightly changed recently, and</p>
<p>Vietnamese Public Opinion</p>
<p>is also extremely dissatisfied with this measure of the French government. The reasons for this are: 1. It should not be overly shown to XX. 2. It should not give up the only opportunity to prosper Vietnam. Moreover, since the opening of the Burma Road, the Burmese authorities have publicly stated that they will help with the shipment of arms to China. This move by Burma is an even more powerful stimulus to French public opinion. Moreover, our country's success in obtaining funds from Britain and the United States has greatly changed the international situation, and it is believed that the French ban on arms passing through Vietnam can be satisfactorily resolved in the near future.</p>

<p>Charles, the 60-year-old captain of the British ship "Dorsetshire," suddenly disappeared on Wednesday of this week. On the morning of that day, at 3 a.m., someone saw Charles in uniform, looking out through the iron bars in front of his bedroom. This was the last trace of him. When his disappearance was heard, people generally thought that he had gone ashore, but according to the gatekeeper of the Kowloon Shipyard, no one left the dock in the middle of the night that day. Also, all the clothes in Charles' room were still neatly arranged, and his bed curtains were also lowered. He was wearing a uniform when he disappeared, and there were no suspicious traces. The ship left Hong Kong for Gijon the day before yesterday and hired a new captain named Doubia. All of Charles' clothes were sent ashore.</p>

<p>The weather has suddenly turned cold in recent days, and it has been raining lightly, and the overcast weather has added to the chill. According to the Observatory's report yesterday morning, yesterday morning was one of the coldest days since last winter. It is estimated that from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. this morning, the Fahrenheit thermometer suddenly dropped by more than ten degrees, falling to 49.9 degrees, breaking the record of below 50 degrees after February last year. Most of the poor residents who did not have cold clothes were huddled on the streets, and some old, weak, and disabled people even froze to death on the roadside. The charitable organizations and philanthropists in Hong Kong should be moved by this, but do they have any thoughts? The weather records from 2 p.m. the day before yesterday to 9 a.m. yesterday are listed below: 2 p.m. the day before yesterday: 58 degrees, 5 p.m.: 54.5 degrees, 7 p.m.: 54.1 degrees, 9 p.m.: 52.7 degrees, 11 p.m.: 52 degrees, 1 a.m. yesterday morning: 51 degrees, 2 a.m.: 50.9 degrees, 3 a.m.: 49.9 degrees, 4 a.m.: 50.7 degrees, 5 a.m.: 51 degrees, 6 a.m.: 51.3 degrees, 7 a.m.: 51.4 degrees, 8 a.m.: 51.3 degrees, 9 a.m.: 51.5 degrees, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.: 50 degrees to 54 degrees.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Prolonged Drought Causes Sharp Decline in Hong Kong and Kowloon Water Storage. Although Residents Strive to Conserve, It is Far From the Level of the United States. Current Water Storage is 185 Million Gallons <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong's rainfall last year was abnormally scarce, making it the most arid year in more than forty years. The water storage situation in various reservoirs has been of great concern to the general public. According to an announcement by the Hong Kong Water Authority yesterday, as of the first of this month, the total water storage of various reservoirs in Hong Kong Island was 135,238,000 gallons, compared to 165,524,000 gallons in the same period last year. The total water storage of various reservoirs in the Kowloon Peninsula was 185,329,000 gallons, compared to 284,271,000 gallons in the same period last year. As for the consumption situation, taking December last year as an example, due to the implementation of water rationing, the daily supply time was only 8 hours, so the increase in the number of difficult people and the amount of water consumption decreased. It is estimated that in December last year, there were 550,000 people in Hong Kong and the Peak area, but the total water consumption was only 34,741 gallons, with an average daily water consumption of 20.4 gallons per person. In the same period of the previous year, there were 445,000 people and the total water consumption was 42,131 gallons, with an average daily water consumption of 30.5 gallons per person. In the Kowloon Peninsula, in December last year, there were 900,000 people, and the total water consumption was 24,059 gallons, with an average daily water consumption of 15.5 gallons per person. In the same period of the previous year, there were 380,000 people and the total water consumption was 25,399 gallons, with an average daily water consumption of 20.6 gallons per person. In terms of the above-mentioned storage situation and water consumption situation, residents have tried their best to conserve water, but the amount of water stored in the reservoirs is still not as good as in the past. This is probably because the total rainfall in Hong Kong last year was fundamentally lower than in the previous year. It is estimated that the previous year received 82.5 inches, while last year only received 55.35 inches, a huge difference. The table of water storage in each reservoir as of the first of this month is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Island</p>
<p>Tai Tam Reservoir 251.44 Million Gallons</p>
<p>Tai Tam Byewash Reservoir Not Detailed</p>
<p>Tai Tam Middle Reservoir 21.31 Million Gallons</p>
<p>Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir 83.2 Million Gallons</p>
<p>Wong Nai Chung Reservoir 4.96 Million Gallons</p>
<p>Pok Fu Lam Reservoir 52.18 Million Gallons</p>
<p>Hong Kong Upper Reservoir 125.53 Million Gallons</p>

<p>Chen Pishi, President of Hong Kong National News Agency, was recently appointed by Zhang Jian, Director of the Guangdong Relief Committee, as the representative of the Committee in Hong Kong, responsible for fundraising matters. After Chen was appointed, he has been actively working. He told reporters yesterday that Guangdong has now become a very important battlefield. From now on, medical relief matters will be centralized to achieve the effect of command and control. The Guangdong Relief Committee will be the central organization for handling these matters. The service personnel and medical supplies are extremely lacking. We should mobilize to ensure that the wounded and sick receive the most complete diagnosis and treatment. The Japanese invasion has fundamentally broken the boundaries between the military and civilians, who are all suffering from oppression. Therefore, all medical relief matters are handled in a unified manner. The Committee has several battlefield rescue teams serving on the front lines, including the International Red Cross Rescue Team and the Chinese Red Cross Rescue Team. The Committee is currently located in Shaoguan and has established twelve battlefield hospitals. The Committee has now dispatched Chun Lin and Li Jingguo to assist the Hong Kong office in handling all matters. The office address is currently being actively searched for. Before the address is determined, if all sectors have any business dealings, please contact Chen at Room 319, 319 Princess Street, Central Avenue (telephone 2794).</p>

<p>A child wrote "A Record of the Establishment of the Society for Life Education"</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, on a refreshing morning, the reporter visited Mr. Tao Xingzhi at his residence again. As if he had received an unexpected harvest, Mr. Tao presented a copy of "A Record of the Inaugural Meeting of the Society for Life Education."</p>
<p>The content of this record is vivid, lively, sincere, and interesting, and it is clearly a material worthy of attention.</p>
<p>What excited us most was Zhang Changjun, who took notes on this record. When Mr. Tao introduced Zhang Jun and the Xin'an Travel Group to the reporter, he fully expressed his happiness and joy. The reporter was also deeply moved and filled with infinite expectations for the little masters of the new China and the future of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>It turned out that the child Zhang Changjun was a member of the Xin'an Travel Group and was only sixteen years old. His intelligence and ability make our generation of adults feel very ashamed!</p>
<p>Tong Chang is one of the many outstanding little friends trained by the Xin'an Travel Group. It is also necessary to report on this well-known and brand-new children's organization in our country to comfort the overseas Chinese who care about the motherland.</p>
<p>The Xin'an Travel Group constantly works and learns, practicing the credo of "Life is Education" and "Society is School." Its nature is a traveling school and a work group. When the Suiyuan War broke out, the group launched amazing work and won attention and admiration at home and abroad. After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident ignited the flames of war, the group's long march in the great era became more active. Propaganda, condolences, fundraising, official propaganda, drama, guiding children, organizing children, promoting cooperation between the military and civilians, and promoting the national salvation movement... all showed remarkable achievements. Their footprints have covered eleven provinces and completed a long march of more than 20,000 miles. Wherever they passed, they sowed "new ladders" and assisted the military and political authorities, and grew up in real life. They are indeed creating a bright new page for history.</p>
<p>It is found that there are more than 40 children in the group, the youngest is only ten years old, and the oldest is only sixteen or seventeen years old. All the organization and activities are designed and cooperated by the children themselves. Mr. Wang Dazhi is their advisor, but he is only limited to being an "advisor" and not a commander. When the Society for Life Education was established in Guilin on February 15, the group happened to be in Guilin, so they all participated, and the child Tong Chang actually wrote a vivid and enthusiastic record. The Political Department of the Military Commission has now specially invited the group to work in the northwest provinces. They also specially invited the Shanghai Children's Theater Troupe to work in the southwest provinces. These two new children's groups are equally valued by the authorities and compete with each other.</p>
<p>"Who says we are young?" The new masters of the new China have grown up in an era of suffering.</p>
<p>The full text of the record of the establishment of the Society for Life Education recorded by the child Tong Chang was originally published in this newspaper yesterday. Due to typesetting reasons, it had to be slightly delayed. Also, because the original text was lengthy, only the essential parts are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Excerpts from "Record of the Establishment of the Society for Life Education": Recorded by Chang of the Xin'an Travel Group.</p>
<p>After Wuhan and Guangzhou were abandoned, and the central government made new arrangements for the second phase of the War of Resistance. The air in Guilin was in a new harmony. The Society for Life Education, which had been fighting for the new education cause in China for twelve years, was officially established in Guilin under the advocacy of the Guangxi authorities.</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting was held at the Guangxi Provincial Government on December 15. About 1,500 members and guests attended.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Xingzhi, who had been separated from his Guangxi compatriots for several years, gave a concise report on the life education over the past twelve years:</p>
<p>Representatives from the Guangxi Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department gave speeches. Qiu, Director of the Education Department of the Provincial Government, also earnestly said:</p>
<p>"The four types of educational movements that the Society for Life Education has strived for in the past are very beneficial to the country. They have all been done in Guangxi. Recently, Mr. Tao dodged XX aircraft and gave us a suggestion for "Cave Education." This suggestion is very good. We have already started doing it and plan to expand it as a plan for Guangxi's Adult Education Year next year?"</p>
<p>The meeting passed the charter and thirty-three directors and fifteen supervisors. There were actually only thirty-three directors, because Mr. Tao said: "Our directors and supervisors should have representatives from all ethnic groups. Mr. Tang Gou San is a representative of the Hui people, and Mr. Xi Rao Cuo is a representative of the Tibetan people, but there is no representative from Mongolia yet. We believe there will be one soon, so we will leave a name blank…" Among the fifteen candidates for supervisors, one was Zhao Hongwenguo (i.e., Old Mrs. Zhao). This old lady represents the Manchu people on the one hand, and although she only knows four words, she is the mother of the Chinese guerrillas and a most loyal practitioner of life education, so she was also elected as a supervisor.</p>
<p>People suddenly stood up, and three thousand eyes suddenly focused on the left doorway of the auditorium, followed by a burst of thunderous applause. It turned out that General Bai Chongxi, who had fought all over the country and was admired by the world, had arrived!</p>
<p>The chairman said excitedly: "Now please invite Deputy Chief of Staff Bai to speak."</p>
<p>Clap clap clap… clap clap clap… General Bai said calmly:</p>
<p>"What I am talking about today is 'Total War and Total Tactics.'"</p>
<p>"…Our War of Resistance against Japanese XXism is a war of national revolution, so it should be a total war. Tactics must be coordinated with the war, so we should have total tactics…</p>
<p>"How should this kind of battle be fought?</p>
<p>"What is studied in ordinary schools is regular warfare, which is a military comparison of equal equipment and equal technology. The battles in the situation above are not found in medicine, not found on maps, and teachers have not invited us to learn them in school. -- I personally have never learned it.</p>
<p>"We can only create new tactics from experience. What are the new tactics? They are total tactics that comprehensively use evasion warfare, mobile warfare, and positional warfare. …"</p>
<p>General Bai spoke very correctly and decisively, giving a good explanation of life education from the process of total tactics.</p>
<p>Finally, General Bai felt that the Chinese War of Resistance would take at least three years to win: "Some people may think, 'Ah, there are still eighteen or nine months!' But I want to tell them that when we were in the revolution of 1915, we fought against the Northern Warlords for two years. Now we are fighting against such a brutal Japanese XXism in the world. I say at least three years. Is the price still high?"</p>
<p>Occasional humorous interjections caused laughter in the hall. The applause lasted for three minutes. Everyone automatically stood up to pay their respects until General Bai walked to his seat.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao stood up to thank him and said:</p>
<p>"Just now, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai said: The new tactics are the total tactics of comprehensive use of guerrilla warfare, mobile warfare, and positional warfare. This is a truth. Similarly, one of the five principles announced by Chairman Chiang at the Hengshan Conference is to emphasize guerrilla warfare. One of our educational responsibilities is to publicize the truth, and we should let everyone know the truths stated by Chiang and Bai. But teachers also have a responsibility to refute XX."</p>
<p>The three songs sung by the children of the Xin'an Travel Group received a warm welcome, especially when the children innocently sang "Think about it, it's still a bastard," the audience applauded again. General Bai laughed happily and shook the hands of the five or six children to help him clap.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao, an educator and public poet, came out with a smile again:</p>
<p>"Now it is a total war of resistance. Military men should be cultured, and women should be armed. I just wrote a short poem: "Literati are militarized, military men are cultured, neither literary nor military are cultured. Literati and military men no longer scold each other, but unite to create a new world!" Now, please invite Guo Moruo, the leader of the Chinese literary world and armed, to speak." (Laughter, applause.)</p>
<p>Mr. Guo walked up slowly, and he couldn't help but smile. The demeanor of an orator and the heroic posture of fighting were gone. He was melting into the pleasant atmosphere full of children's vigor.</p>
<p>"After Mr. Bai spoke, the children from the Xin'an Travel Group and the Zhongshan Memorial School performed in front of everyone. I feel ashamed when I see it.</p>
<p>"There is a saying in China that 'each generation is not as good as the previous one.' Today, after seeing the activities of the children, I deeply feel that 'each generation is not as good as the previous one.' What the ancients meant was that later generations are not as good as previous generations, but what we see today is that 'each generation is not as good as the previous one,' which means that the previous generation is not as good as the later generation!" (Applause)</p>
<p>"Just having this point is enough to prove that the final victory must be ours. I am not very clear about other children's groups. I am relatively clear about the Xin'an Travel Group and the Children's Theater Troupe. The Xin'an Travel Group started from Jiangsu before the War of Resistance. It has already traveled 30,000 miles and left a deep impression in the northwest. When we came back to the south this time, we saw how organized and hardworking their work was!</p>
<p>"The Children's Theater Troupe was organized in Shanghai after the War of Resistance. After Shanghai fell, they ran out and did a lot of work from Nantong Zhengzhou to Wuhan. This is something everyone knows.</p>
<p>"Who created the Xin'an Travel Group and the Children's Theater Troupe? They were all created by Mr. Tao, our Chinese 'Pestalozzi'."</p>
<p>"Life education emphasizes practice and inspires consciousness and creativity. It is to closely link education and life, so there is also the slogan 'Life is Education' and 'Society is School.' The children have practiced this principle and principle, which is different from the people of our previous generation. The Xin'an Travel Group and the Children's Theater Troupe are the embodiment and specimen of life education!</p>
<p>"Recently, the Political Department has determined two principles for propaganda work: 'Propaganda is education' and 'Service is propaganda.' It can also be said that it is imitating Mr. Tao's 'Life is Education' and 'Society is School.' The determination of this propaganda principle is the result of twelve years of hard work in life education, and it can also be said that it is the more than a year of the War of Resistance that made us feel that we need life education.</p>
<p>"Now the children are in front of you all. How pure and brave they are. I hope that everyone can be like these children and create a pure and flawless "New China!" with a pure and flawless spirit. (Applause)</p>
<p>"Mr. Guo also told us a truth: "Learn from the children"!"</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe's second team's "Escape to Guilin" was performed under the leadership of Jin Shan and Wang Ying, earning a lot of laughter and tears. When the meeting was dismissed, General Bai was surrounded by friends again. Some of the children wrote down his speech and asked him to revise it. Some of the children surrounded him and asked him about the war. He asked the children of the Xin'an Travel Group about the situation in the Northwest. He asked, "Were you there when I went to Ningxia in the spring?"</p>
<p>Finally, he told the children: "I work at the XX School on XX Street. You can come and find me tomorrow."</p>
<p>When the lights came on, the majestic general and the innocent children said goodbye enthusiastically.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Illness in Hong Kong <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Huan</p>
<p>Those who have lived in Hong Kong for a long time all know: "Being sick in Hong Kong is a terrible thing!"</p>
<p>Being sick is, of course, a miserable thing. It is also a miserable thing to fall ill there. What kind of illness in Hong Kong is particularly terrible? Let me tell you the facts—</p>
<p>There are too many doctors in Hong Kong, especially now. In the past, there was already a saying in Hong Kong that "there are more doctors than patients"; now there is another group of Chinese and Western doctors who have fled from Guangzhou and other places to practice as refugees. So the number of doctors has increased a lot! But even though there are many doctors, it doesn't feel easy to get medical treatment. We know that the consultation fee for an ordinary Chinese medicine practitioner is one dollar, while for a Western doctor it is two or three dollars. If you invite them to your home, a Chinese medicine practitioner charges three dollars, and a Western doctor charges five dollars. The fees double in the early morning and evening, double for long distances, and increase again for crossing the sea. If an ordinary person is sick, they go to a Chinese medicine clinic, and it costs at least one dollar for the consultation fee and more than one dollar for the medicine, totaling at least two or three dollars. If you invite a doctor to your home to take your pulse, it costs five or six dollars a day. Going to an internal medicine clinic, including consultation fees and medicine, costs at least five or six dollars a day. Inviting a Western doctor to your home costs at least ten or eight dollars a day.</p>
<p>Assuming the illness heals in seven days, it will cost more than twenty dollars to go to a Chinese medicine clinic, and thirty or forty dollars to invite a Chinese medicine practitioner to your home. It will cost thirty or forty dollars to go to a Western medicine clinic, and sixty or seventy dollars to invite a Western doctor to your home.</p>
<p>The above figures, in Hong Kong where the cost of living is increasing day by day, pose a very serious threat to the general wage-earning class or small business owners. For someone who earns one hundred dollars a month, if unfortunately someone in their family falls ill, spending thirty or forty dollars, or forty or fifty dollars, is a major blow to their finances. It is even more unimaginable for the laboring masses with lower incomes. They certainly cannot afford the above methods, and the result is only as the saying goes: "If you have money, you can afford to treat the illness. If you have no money, you have to risk your life." If poor people get a serious illness, they can only die—</p>
<p>The medical expenses mentioned above are only for ordinary Chinese and Western doctors with some reputation. The fees are even more than this amount. I know that some famous Chinese and Western doctors charge five dollars for a house call and one dollar for a consultation, with double fees for long distances... Recently, some even charge twenty dollars for a house call, five dollars for registration, and thirty dollars for a consultation... As for famous Western doctors, they charge each other five dollars for a house call and ten dollars for a consultation, and some even charge fifty dollars to come to the door late at night. In such cases, it is really not easy for people who are sick in Hong Kong to seek medical treatment!</p>
<p>Even if you are a wealthy person, you may still not be able to meet the demands if you encounter a doctor who does not treat you well. This is a true story. I have a friend who went to an eye doctor, examined his eyes, spent ten dollars, and got back a bottle of sour water.</p>
<p>You might say that there are also government-run, public, and church-run hospitals, but you must know that there are only a dozen hospitals in Hong Kong and Kowloon, while the population of Hong Kong and Kowloon exceeds one million. The supply is far from meeting the demand!</p>
<p>Hospital costs are also not low. In ordinary public or private hospitals, the top-class rooms cost more than two to more than twenty dollars a day, including medical expenses. Middle-class rooms cost ten or eight dollars, and the cheapest rooms cost three or four dollars - although there are also rooms that cost fifty cents, but due to various reasons, those who can afford to pay for it also live in the more expensive rooms.</p>
<p>Speaking of the so-called "private hospitals," although they are better, the costs are shocking. Hospital fees, medical fees, medicine fees, meal fees, accommodation fees for the caregiver, and even some flowers and alcohol are also charged for. A friend went to the hospital for six days, and when he was discharged, the administrator gave him a bill for more than four hundred dollars. He could only shake his head and sigh after looking at it.</p>
<p>Hospital staff cannot completely eliminate discrimination based on the patient's room level and the amount of tips given. Many are impatient when serving, scolding patients, and are sloppy in their work and unwilling to do their best... All of these are very regrettable things about hospitals!</p>
<p>There are too few charitable hospitals established by charitable organizations. Even when patients are exposed to the sun or undergo other procedures, there are no "nurses" to take care of them. As a result, very dangerous incidents occur because patients are not cared for and instruments are not managed...</p>
<p>Don't mention the free medical and pharmaceutical organizations, because there are too many people seeking medical treatment; doctors are too busy, and there are not enough administrators... so there are perfunctory things happening. I have witnessed that in five minutes, a male doctor continuously examined six patients.</p>
<p>The doctor's time on duty is probably very short, right (?) There are too many patients, right (?) It is often difficult to find a doctor immediately when a patient is in critical condition...</p>
<p>What is the patient's sin? They suffer from the pain of illness, the loss of money, the pain of oppression, and the pain of poor treatment!</p>
<p>This is the truth: "Being sick in Hong Kong is a terrible thing!"</p>

<h3 id="e20">Zhou Zuoren and Lu Xun <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper of the fourth of this month, I learned that Mr. Zhou Zuoren was seriously injured in an assassination attempt by two young men at his residence in Beiping on the third. Amidst the waves of the Wang Jingwei case, it is another matter that has attracted attention.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Zuoren is the younger brother of Mr. Lu Xun, the two took completely opposite paths. Mr. Lu Xun firmly advocated resisting Japan in order to achieve national freedom and liberation. Therefore, even though he is dead, when people talk about the war of resistance, they think of Mr. Lu Xun; when they talk about Mr. Lu Xun, they also think of the war of resistance. Mr. Lu Xun is a national soul respected by generations, but Zhou Zuoren is different. This old man who drank "bitter tea" in the "Bitter Rain Studio" for ten years was so confused when the Japanese occupied Beiping that he talked about "revitalizing Chinese culture!" with the ethnic aggressors.</p>
<p>I remember that a group of people in Japan who liked to study Chinese literature organized a "Chinese Literature Research Association." They published an official magazine called "Sino-Japanese Literature" (please note that they did not use "Shina" or "Shina Literature"). In one issue, they published articles by the Zhou brothers and included an illustration. Beside the drawing, the brothers seemed to each have a poem. I don't remember clearly, and I don't have their works on hand to check, so I can only leave it at that. As for that illustration, it depicted: a tall tower, with Mr. Lu Xun sitting at the top of the tower, leading the general literary movement. Below the tower was a small river, and a small wooden bridge was built over the river. On the bridgehead on the opposite bank, Mr. Zhou Zuoren, riding a white horse, could not cross the small wooden bridge. Now, this "bitter tea" master who rides a white horse not only cannot cross this small wooden bridge, but also walks in the opposite direction - riding a white horse and raising a white flag, walking into the enemy camp.</p>
<p>In the early days of the May Fourth New Literature Movement, the Zhou brothers were both literary giants. Their achievements during that period, from a cultural and literary-historical point of view, cannot be denied. It is a pity that Zhou Zuoren did not understand the development of history and social change, could not resist the torrent of the times, and the practical struggles. When Mr. Lu Xun stepped forward, leading progressive cultural figures and progressive writers, for truth, for justice, for resisting the dark forces, and for fighting hard for the future of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhou Zuoren escaped reality, hid in the "Bitter Rain Studio" to drink "bitter tea," enjoying leisure and not asking about worldly affairs. What's even worse is that in his mind, he may have been ironically criticizing Mr. Lu Xun's "busyness" in an Ah Q manner. From that time on, Zhou Zuoren's progressive significance disappeared, and he had already put on a negative shield and become a historical figure. About three years ago, the Japanese House of Peers member, Japanese nationalist scholar Sanzue Mikami, gave a shameless speech in the parliament, saying that China should not be called the Republic of China, and that Shina was the name of China. I remember that Zhou Zuoren wrote a long article scolding him. At that time, we were very pleased that he still retained some of the "May Fourth Spirit." Unexpectedly, two years later, he actually talked with the aggressors about "revitalizing Chinese culture," believing that the Chinese people could not recognize the benefits of Japan unless they went to Japan - this is really regrettable, but it is also the inevitable conclusion of "drinking bitter tea." Literary figures who are shaken and afraid of struggle and political figures who are shaken and compromise and are afraid of struggle are no different.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Under the Setting Sun <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Yu</p>
<p>Unacquainted friend, you should remember: when you first came to this place, it was at dusk when the sun was setting; this dusk was beautiful, mysterious, and intoxicating. Isn't it? The colorful sunset glow in the sky is reflected on the walls of the small Western-style houses built of glass stone, blending a mysterious color that cannot be found in paintings of the Greek era.</p>
<p>In the past, within this realm, boundless sweet affection reflected endless beautiful scenery; the woman in the glass stone small Western-style house, Bei Bei, was a charming woman, like a peony, like a peony. Every day, wearing a glamorous evening dress, she stood by the small flower garden in front of the door, gazing at the colorful clouds in the sky, as if it were an uninterrupted habit. Her captivating eyes and smile would attract the attention of passers-by, and car drivers would also cause accidents because of her.</p>
<p>However, after you came, this dirty, withered, and tattered appearance destroyed the entire beautiful realm. The so-called destruction is that the charming Bei Bei has hidden herself, perhaps afraid that the foul smell all over you will make her vomit. But I, when I passed this place as usual that evening, like appreciating a precious painting, was attracted by you, this sudden embellishment.</p>
<p>My intention was that adding a dirty and tattered you to such a magnificent and mysterious scene, if this were really a painting, then the meaning contained in this painting would indeed be rare.</p>
<p>But I never thought that this imaginary appreciation would lead to another kind of problem:</p>
<p>Thick black eyebrows, bright pupils, long ears, straight nose, these marks on your face have been imprinted in my mind for a long, long time: However, from what place did I capture such an intimate image for you? Back at my residence, I couldn't sleep that night because of you. I blamed myself for being forgetful, and I resented my poor memory.</p>
<p>The next morning, I passed by you again, and you were already lying on the sidewalk, your body covered with a straw mat, and the straw mat was shaking slightly. I thought you must be unable to resist the cold in the air; were you shivering? Even if you were physically strong, you would inevitably be attacked by illness, right? Who knew that you really got sick because of this: from then on, you were unable to struggle to get up, and all day long you seemed to be half-asleep, always silently looking at the gate of the glass stone small Western-style house with a pair of bright pupils. You didn't shout, you didn't groan, and at the same time you didn't seem to be hungry or thirsty. Time slipped by day by day, and the glory of the setting sun shone on your bed again and again, quietly, always quietly.</p>
<p>The charming Bei Bei, hidden deep in the small Western-style house, also quietly disappeared. The apple green Austin parked in the garage, and its loud horn also fell silent.</p>
<p>However, the question that hangs in my heart is still unresolved; I know you, but I forgot the time and place we met.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to put it aside as a "mystery," the sealed gourd was opened:</p>
<p>On the last day, I went to Avenue Joffre and passed the door of a foreign photography studio, and a photo placed in the glass window recalled my memory; it turned out that the image left in my mind was this photo, and the face in the photo was you; thick black eyebrows... a romantic and handsome expression, smiling at passers-by.</p>
<p>In order to solve a heavy case, I pushed open the glass door of the photography studio. I foolishly hoped to find your secret from the mouth of any member of the photography studio. Although I was disappointed, I discovered a miracle here. What is it? Among the many colored enlarged sample photos hanging on the walls of the photography studio, there was also a picture of you, and beside you was a charming woman. I took a closer look, what? The woman turned out to be Bei Bei, the hostess of the glass stone small Western-style house - I suspected that I was dreaming, but in fact I was not in a dream.</p>
<p>So I suddenly realized it, like a detective cracking a case. I hurriedly took a streetcar back, wanting to comfort you a few words, no, or maybe to find some writing material from your mouth. Where could I find you? When I came back, you were gone, you had left the world, and the remaining corpse was taken to Pushan Mountain Villa for burial.</p>
<p>Looking at the wet marks on the ground, a layer of melancholy floated in my heart.</p>
<p>You were young, you were brave, the times needed you, but you unexpectedly misused your spirit of battle, and now you have died in this "battlefield!"</p>
<p>Evening has come again, and the glory of the setting sun shines on the small Western-style house of glass stone as usual, because the charming Bei Bei comes out to stand idly and gaze as usual, so the environment here still restores the beauty and mystery of the past. Your death has not had the slightest impact on this place.</p>
<p>That being the case, if you have a soul and are conscious, I hope you repent, repent forever!</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Enemy of Women <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Sha</p>
<p>Last week, I read in the newspaper that Hitler had established an association to reward mothers for giving birth, and had newly ordered various medals. Women who gave birth to many children could receive bronze, silver, and gold cross medals respectively, which they could wear on their chests, indicating that they had "contributed to the country." At almost the same time, Mussolini also shouted loudly: "War is to mankind as childbirth is to women." These two sworn fascist brothers, singing in harmony, are truly "theoretically profound" and have "a way to have children."</p>
<p>Turning through history, we can't find anyone who has destroyed and slaughtered women more than Hitler and Mussolini. They are truly the number one "public enemy" of women all over the world!</p>
<p>In order to establish a (brown) Third Reich, in order to restore the glory of the ancient Roman Empire, and especially in order to protect the pockets of the oligarchic financial capitalists at home, they did not hesitate to provoke a destructive war, and did not hesitate to push batches of women working in society back home - especially back to bed, implementing the so-called "contribution to the country" of giving birth; turning women's sacred duty of perpetuating the human race into machines for mass-producing cannon fodder. Unexpectedly, under the arrangement of the brown Prime Minister and the black-shirted dictator, a small fascist family - perhaps in the bed tent - is also filled with the air of "war permeating!"</p>
<p>According to these two benevolent brothers, it seems that the more children women have, the more they "contribute to the country"; then giving birth to at least a dozen children, and giving birth twice a year like a "sow," should be worthy of admiration and learning. Perhaps Hitler and Mussolini are mobilizing a large number of scientists to study the "sow's childbirth method" in order to implement the "sow's policy" in the future. If one day they succeed in their research and put it into practice, then wouldn't every woman in Germany and Italy appear in the posture of a "sow?" This is naturally "contributing to the country" and should be given the "Gold Cross Medal."</p>
<p>If this kind of "new maternal type" really appears in fascist countries, how ashamed and embarrassed should women all over the world be - is a woman really just a "reproducing animal" and a "machine for manufacturing cannon fodder?"</p>
<p>For their own freedom and happiness, and for the justice and peace of mankind, I believe that women all over the world should unite, regardless of nationality, to extinguish these two "enemies of women" and overthrow this pair of fascist fellows who have distorted female morality!</p>
<h3 id="e23">National Crisis Fortune <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Sang Zi</p>
<p>No matter how skilled you are in reading the Eight Characters of Destiny or how proficient you are in studying the Physiognomy, you would never have thought that in addition to "legitimate wealth" and "unexpected wealth," there is also "national crisis wealth" at present.</p>
<p>It is said that "legitimate wealth" is the income from one's own work; "unexpected wealth" is an unexpected and lucky gain; the former is legitimate, and the latter is a fluke. In the eyes of those who know their destiny or are discerning, these are all destined or born with, and cannot be forced or sought after. Let's leave that aside. Who knew that during the Anti-Japanese War, many people started to make "national crisis fortunes," causing Dr. Ma Yinchu to petition the government to arrest and punish them. If Mr. Ziping and Taoist Ma Yi knew about this in the underworld, they would surely thank Dr. Ma for correcting the erroneous astrological views of the general public, right?</p>
<p>Indeed, those unscrupulous elements, disregarding shame, willingly flattered the enemy, and took the opportunity to collude with a group of vagrants, engaged in various acts of sabotage against the war of resistance, and profited greatly from it. Their wickedness is greater than the enemy, and they are indeed guilty and deserve to be punished. If they are tolerated, the country will suffer, and it will become increasingly serious. We agree with Dr. Ma's proposal that the government should issue effective measures to sanction those who make "national crisis fortunes" and order their strict implementation. However, in fact, those who make "national crisis fortunes" are not just these unscrupulous elements: let's leave others aside for the time being, such as: "There are some 'landlords' and some 'sub-landlords' on Hong Kong Island. They are also taking advantage of the 'national crisis' to make a great 'fortune'!"</p>
<p>Some "landlords" and some "sub-landlords" are taking advantage of the national crisis, taking advantage of people's difficulties, arbitrarily increasing rents, or raising prices indiscriminately, ignoring the suffering of people who are displaced and have lost their homes, only seeking wealth to enter their doors, to enjoy their leisure. This kind of selfish and self-interested behavior, even if we ignore the impact on the progress of the entire war of resistance, is something that needs to be condemned, even from the point of view of human beings helping each other.</p>
<p>We hope that people in society will also thoroughly investigate those who use houses as a tool for making "national crisis fortunes"!</p>
<h3 id="e24">Remembering Mr. Mao Dun <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>Judging by the date, he should have arrived in Kunming by now, Mr. Mao Dun wrote to me on the 19th, informing me of his departure, and he left here on the 20th. I have no chance to meet him. What I feel in my heart is infinite regret, as if there is an irreparable loss, and I have been unhappy for several days because of it. I admire, respect, and cherish him as my first and dearest teacher.</p>
<p>The north is bitterly cold, and it must be a time when the snow has covered the ankles. The sorrowful sky freezes the layers of clouds, low and dark, and the distant wind and sand sting the faces of passersby. There is no singing of birds, no low humming of insects, and no trace of green can be drilled out of the white wilderness. Perhaps only the continuous mountains, the decaying ancient roads, have the tragic sound of famous horses of the border neighing in the wind, and the golden eagle spreading its great wings... With passion, Mr. Mao Dun has stepped towards the "new land" of the northwest. In the distant corners of the earth, I respectfully offer my prayers for a safe journey against the wind from the north.</p>
<p>The northwest, with its magnificent mountains and rivers, is the arm of the motherland. Mother Nature, here, tempers her children, as if she were using a merciless whip on them. However, the children have iron-like hands and strong bodies that resist wind and snow because of this. The sentence "There is no spring here" has become their proud phrase in their life struggles. Mr. Mao Dun is weak in literature, but he has great hope. He wants to live there as a "spiritual mentor" for young people, instructing them to "fight for the glory of this generation"—therefore, I sincerely pray for his life and hope.</p>
<p>However, how jealous I am at this time! Does Mr. Mao Dun have a preference for the youth of the Northwest? Or is it that the laziness and dullness of our children in the South are not worthy of Mr. Mao Dun's teachings? No, that's not it—the times need his strength, and great strength can only be unfolded in a great realm. The "new land" in the Northwest needs Mr. Mao Dun to cultivate, so he has to brave the wind and snow, run long distances, and heavily shoulder the burden that awaits him. I think I should let go of my jealousy, but a sense of envy cannot be let go.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun's arrival was a great joy for the literary and artistic youth here. He is a role model but not an idol. He is a leader who raises the flag and leads the way, not as an adult, but with the love, guidance, and kindness of a teacher and a friend, giving them affectionately. Therefore, they have a vigorous vitality for upward development.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun has artistic tolerance. He knows very well that if he uses his all-seeing eyes to illuminate our works that are "not very qualified" yet, it would just be a piece of dull wood, just a pile of sea sand. But, perhaps this wood can be carved into art, and perhaps this pile of sea sand also contains gold. He feels that art can have a certain degree of tolerance, and he does not hesitate to make his own publications, in which he pours his heart and soul, a bit "haphazard." This tolerance has inspired the hearts of many of our literary and artistic youth and made us realize that we should move forward.</p>
<p>He also has artistic rigor. He knows very well that if he does not give "young people" a standard, they will be confused and waste their efforts, and they will not find the true path. Therefore, rigor and tolerance become a double beauty, or even a "double perfection"—although "rotten wood cannot be carved," he will never forget to point out that if there is still beauty in the rotten wood, he will remove the rotten parts and keep the solid parts, and personally start working on it. Who would not understand his good intentions? Whoever does not, is willing to lose out. Whoever can truly understand it will gain the most valuable lessons.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mao Dun and Mr. Lu Xun are very similar, right?" Perhaps someone would ask. Yes, Mr. Mao Dun is now continuing the work of his old friend, and now he is shouldering double the responsibility. Ms. Jing Song said in "Lu Xun and the Youth" (Wen Zhen, Volume 2, Issue 1): "Sometimes when meeting foreign friends, when asked about the future of the Chinese intellectual community, Mr. (Lu Xun) must mention Mr. ×× and ×× youth... and often worried that Mr. ××'s body was too weak, even more than his own. Now, unfortunately, it has been two years since Mr. Lu Xun passed away. I hope that Mr. ××, etc., will take care of themselves for the sake of the country and strive for the future." Yes, Mr. Lu Xun, with his tough fighting spirit, has passed away, and Mr. Mao Dun has an increased responsibility. The highest intention of "taking care of himself for the sake of the country" is dedicated to this literary giant thousands of miles away.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Today's First Division Football League: Only Eastern Team Plays for the Chinese; Several Eastern Players Injured, Formation Changes <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] South China is small, nostalgic for soldiers, but the battles in the football city are not cooling down due to South China's travels in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Today at noon, there are as many as sixteen league matches in the First, Second, and Third Divisions. Among the First Division Chinese teams, only Eastern is playing. We should focus our attention on this.</p>
<p>Eastern is playing against the Hong Kong Football Club. Both are teams that are behind in points. The outcome is not of great importance.</p>
<p>Kowloon Football Club versus Middlesex also lacks importance. However, the match at the narrow Kowloon Football Club ground is noteworthy. In terms of strength, the Middlesex team is stronger. Moreover, Gurney has completed his suspension and can play today. Logically, they should have a good chance of winning. However, the venue is unfavorable to the visiting team, so the away team may not find it easy to win.</p>
<p>The Navy's current points are only one point behind South China. Therefore, any gains the team makes in any match from now on will have a significant impact on South China. They will definitely win today's match against the Police Football Club. It is expected that the Police will not be able to achieve much, which will benefit both South China teams.</p>
<p>Eastern's Song Ling, Li Deqi, and 　　Tao were all injured in last week's Special Silver Shield. However, Li may still play today, while Song will need to rest. Xu Jingcheng has been specially recalled to resume his position as center forward, and Lai Tingcai has been promoted to left winger. If so, the attacking power will definitely decrease, and victory may not be guaranteed. The two formations are as follows: (Football Field Deity)</p>

<p>[Shanghai Correspondent] In the preliminary round of the International Cup football match, the Chinese United team met the English team at Yiyuan yesterday (2nd). Nearly 　 spectators were present, and the scene was no less grand than Christmas 　　　. Chinese United came from behind, eliminating England with a score of 3-1, advancing to the second week. Chinese United felt that the center back 　 was still weak, so a selection committee was convened before the match, and on the proposal of Le Xiurong, Meng Yiliang was additionally selected to play as left forward. English player Simmons was absent. After the match, English player Walter was awarded a penalty, opening the scoring. In the second half, Chinese United rallied and their momentum surged.

<h3 id="e30">Tonight's Women's Basketball Game: Mei Fang vs. Overseas Chinese Have a Fierce Competition; South China vs. Pui To at 6:30 PM <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Guangda and Zhixing successively withdrew from this year's women's basketball 　, the multi-faceted championship competition has changed into a three-way standoff.</p>
<p>Mei Fang, Pui To, and 　qiao are the three current powers. However, the Overseas Chinese team has had an unfavorable start, having lost once to Zhixing and again to Pui To, their position is shaky, and their hope of winning the championship is not as high as that of Mei Fang and Pui To. Although Zhixing's withdrawal allows them to cancel that defeat, a glimmer of light has returned to their future, but they have already changed and stained a little flaw.</p>
<p>Observing the recent situation, Mei Fang and Pui To have not suffered a defeat. Regarding the championship ticket, there is only "me and you." However, Pui To has already defeated Overseas Chinese a few days ago, eliminating a strong opponent. Their situation is relatively good, while Mei Fang is not, because Pui To and Overseas Chinese have not yet fought.</p>
<p>Therefore, tonight's battle between Mei Fang and Overseas Chinese is of great importance to the championship issue. If Mei Fang wins, they will overcome a hurdle, and their position and situation will be no different from Pui To. When they compete with Pui To on the fourteenth night, the winner at that time will be the champion.</p>
<p>If Mei Fang fails tonight, the situation will change, benefiting both Pui To and Overseas Chinese. However, the benefit gained by Overseas Chinese still depends on 　. If Overseas Chinese wins tonight, they still have to wait until the fourteenth night when Mei Fang fights Pui To to see who controls the left coupon, and then they can determine their own fate. If Pui To defeats Mei Fang at that time, then the championship will be won by Pui To, and Overseas Chinese and Mei Fang will only compete for the runner-up.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of their own interests, Overseas Chinese must have a kind of contradictory mentality in both the tonight and the fourteenth night matches. What they want to achieve tonight is to defeat Mei Fang, and what they want to achieve on the fourteenth night is to hope that Mei Fang can defeat Pui To. However, this kind of overly selfish ideal may not be realized. However, there are many dreams in basketball, and it may even become a reality.</p>
<p>In short, for Overseas Chinese, there is still hope of winning in tonight's battle, but losing will mean no chance. Therefore, for the sake of their own future, they must fight Mei Fang to the death, and Mei Fang dare not assume that they will definitely win.</p>
<p>A word to the male and female fans, arrive early tonight, because there are not many seats in the gym, 　 arriving late may cause a sigh of regret. The competition schedule is as follows: [Dong Lang]</p>

<p>Entertainment... Three Sisters Sally, Irene And Mary</p>
<p>Is a song and dance film, a musical, radio star, and a silver screen actress concentrated in a song and dance film. The story is scattered, but a song and dance film does not necessarily need a perfect story. It relies on gorgeous arrangements and humorous song and dance to create a successful "song and dance film" that can entertain people.</p>
<p>Alice Faye and Tony Martin have excellent singing and dancing skills. Big Nose Jimmy Durante's humor is consistent and also an outstanding character in the film.</p>
<p>Queen Peace... Iron 　 Hero Men With Wings</p>
<p>The whole film narrates the 　 of the American aviation industry in the past thirty or forty years, and can also be said to be the process of mankind's conquest of space. As a 　 systematic narrative, we often admit that this is also a great and valuable work in the history of film.</p>
<p>The story material seems too broad, so the plot is lengthy, which makes people feel a slight lack of dramatic power. However, all kinds of tense and thrilling scenes completely mask this shortcoming, such as flight accidents, aerial dogfights, life-and-death test flights, the second trans-Atlantic westwards feat, and escaping from a burning aircraft with a parachute. These are all extremely stimulating scenes, and there are also passionate people with a spirit of fearlessness and lofty ambitions, doing earth-shattering feats. Behind them, there are also women who encourage and help, and at the same time worry and cry silently, 　 These are all 　 rich in manipulating the audience's 　 mood power.</p>
<p>The use of color in this film is more than suitable. Starting with those field sceneries, to various brightly colored aircraft soaring in the blue sky full of colorful clouds, the beauty of the picture adds a lot of beauty to the audience.</p>
<p>The acting skills of Fly McCrea and Lei Miller are all very refined. The heroine, Louise Campbell, is a new star who used to play some relatively ordinary films and did not receive much attention. In this film, we discovered that she is a very promising talent.</p>
<p>Oriental... Revolutionary Couple Beloved Enemy</p>
<p>A film about the Irish Revolution. Maner Olang plays the daughter of the British Governor-General in Ireland. She sympathizes with the Irish Revolution and falls in love with their leader (Brand Alan).</p>
<p>The director handled this film quite successfully. Several scenes of searching for 　 Party scenes are also very tense. 　 can grasp the climax of the whole play, and the male and female protagonists are very competent.</p>
<p>Dahua... West Line Spy Network Lancer Spy</p>
<p>The story describes a British officer who looks like a German officer, and the German officer is captured by the British army. He disguises himself as a German officer to go back and scout the enemy's situation, but the German officer has a lover, and this lover does counter-espionage work for Germany. Unexpectedly, they really fall in love with each other, reveal their true feelings, and let the fake German officer go back.</p>
<p>There have been many stories of this kind of espionage activity in the past. This film is certainly not novel. The whole film is handled very loosely, especially the first half is too dull. The two protagonists, George Sanders and 　　　　　　　　, also have no distinctive performance.</p>

<h3 id="e34">The Relationship Between Physical Exercise and Diet <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>- Yu Xuecheng</p>
<p>If you want to strengthen your physique, in addition to exercise, you must also have sufficient nutrition. Many people exercise very hard, but the result is not only no progress but even regression, which is also because of a lack of nutrition. Today, physical education in this extraordinary period focuses on the training of qi and strength, so heavy exercise is the most suitable. Heavy exercise consumes a lot of qi and strength, so nutrition must be increased to 　 supplement it. The nutrition needed by inactive people is far below that of people who are active or work hard. The stronger the physique, the stronger the appetite. Exercise can also activate various parts of the body and harmonize the functions of various organs, improving the efficiency of functions, so the digestive function is旺盛.</p>
<p>In short, exercise and nutrition have a close relationship. If there is a lack of exercise, even if there is rich nutrition, it cannot be 　　. Also, if nutrition is insufficient, exercise cannot be effective. Sufficient nutrition or appropriate food can assist the effect of exercise.</p>
<p>Appropriate food can not only assist exercise, but also assist medicine or directly treat a variety of diseases. The formation of heart disease, pain 　, nephritis, gallstones, skin disease, neuritis and rheumatism and other diseases is often due to nutritional deficiencies or food loss 　. Many people think that they only need to eat more food rich in final nutrition to maintain health, without exercise, which is a kind of wrong concept.</p>
<p>Nutritious foods are not necessarily delicacies such as mountain delicacies and seafood. Such foods are not only far 　 in nutrition than vegetables 　, ordinary meat 　, eggs and other foods, but also inferior in digestion and assimilation. If you cannot 水貨, 　 eating extremely nutritious foods is also useless. Moreover, luxury items such as mountain delicacies and seafood are extremely unsuitable for use during the current war of resistance.</p>
<p>Many people think that nutrition must refer to the quality of food. In fact, this is not the case. What is most related is not the quality of food, but the method and habits of eating. During the war, the quality of food is even more lacking. The remedy is to pay attention to the method of eating.</p>
<p>Eating methods or habits have a close relationship with daily life. Irregular daily life or actions that violate health principles have a great impact on eating habits and methods. Therefore, if you want to improve eating habits and methods, you must first make your daily life conform to health principles.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of how many meals should be eaten each day, some advocate three meals, and others advocate as many as five meals. There are different opinions, but most people advocate three meals a day. The number of meals per day is inversely proportional to the amount of food per meal. The more meals, the less food per meal. If you have three meals a day, the amount of food for breakfast should be the least and dinner should be the most. If the quality of dinner is appropriate, you can skip breakfast the next day, so some people advocate eating two meals a day, namely lunch and dinner, but for people who work hard, if they only eat two meals a day, 　 they can have lunch at 10:00 AM and dinner at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Hong Kong Football Technical Level Indeed Not as Good as Before (2) <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Old Comrades of the Field</p>
<p>Are not all these enough to prove that today's footballers' skills are indeed far inferior to before? Moreover, anyone who has watched the international match between Ireland and Portugal the previous week should still remember how inadequate the strength and technique of little Couthino was. Yet, even when he was almost exhausted in the tough match, he could still seize an opportunity to break through and score a goal single-handedly. Furthermore, the Portuguese team's left inside, Gomes (also translated as Kim, but the Portuguese pronunciation is as above), although not considered technically poor, was not an exceptionally strong player either. Yet, on that day, he was able to score four goals because the Irish team was focused on closely guarding big Couthino. What is this all about? It should be known that although the Irish team was not considered strong on that day, one of their inner defenders, Shi of the Gomido team, is indeed one of the famous inner defenders of various teams today. Moreover, the goalkeeper was McAlistar of the Navy team "Red Duke," who is considered one of the best goalkeepers today. Therefore, it is another ironclad proof that the technical level of today's football team is far inferior to before.</p>
<p>Since football is the sport in which our country has the best chance of victory in athletic competitions, how can we preserve it? This is the most pressing task. I loudly proclaim that "the technical level of Hong Kong football has indeed deteriorated compared to the past," not to criticize today's footballers, but to promote our country's sports and earnestly seek to preserve our country's reputation as the overlord of Far Eastern football and prevent it from declining. Fellow footballers, you must not be complacent; you must always strive for further progress. There is great hope.</p>
<p>Some may ask with doubt, "Since you care so much about football, how can today's Hong Kong footballers improve?" I would say that since the skills of the Western teams in Hong Kong are deteriorating daily, even complete victories in competitions are not enough to increase the enthusiasm of Hong Kong football fans by even a fraction. It is essential for those in charge to collect teaching materials and books, for the enlightened to train the less enlightened actively based on these books, and to seize every opportunity to travel to other places for effective practice. This is the best strategy. It is rumored that the Tung Wah Association plans to travel to Java this year and also visit Australia. If this plan materializes, it will be greatly beneficial. Since there is such an opportunity, the organizers of the South China Athletic Association should do their best to make it happen and not dwell on temporary successes or failures. It should be known that a sports association with a history like the South China Athletic Association bears a particularly great responsibility. It should prioritize training talent for the country, and this is its inescapable duty. As for other associations, such as the Eastern Athletic Association, since their players are all overseas Chinese, they should also do their best to encourage their members to travel far and wide to learn from others' strengths. The competition for the Hong Kong championship is merely a minor matter. (The End)</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, this reporter visited Mr. Wong Ka, chairman of the management committee under the Football Association, to inquire about the Philippine team's visit to Hong Kong for a match. According to Mr. Wong, he is currently one of the selection committee members for the Hong Kong-Philippine interport match. At a temporary meeting of the management committee a few days ago, it was decided to send a letter inviting the Philippine team to visit Hong Kong for a match. Whether the team will come to Hong Kong depends on the Philippine side's response, which is expected to be known in a few days. The reporter also asked whether the selection committee would follow the practice of previous years, where preliminary trials are held for the Chinese team and the reserve team, and then the official players are selected, if the Philippine team could come to Hong Kong. Mr. Wong replied that the committee members already had a clear idea of the candidates and that such trouble was unnecessary. Once the Philippine side replied, they could select the players at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e37">US Budget for Next Year Submitted to Congress for Review, Huge Defense Expenditure, President Advocates Slightly Increasing Tax Rates <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] The expenditure for naval construction in the US budget for 1940 has increased from $115,000,000 to $270,000,000. This increased expenditure will be used to build two battleships in 1940 and expand the naval air force to a target of 3,000 aircraft, starting with 93. The naval personnel will also increase by 5,500 to 113,000. [Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The Navy Department has submitted a bill to Congress, advocating that the Federal Maritime Commission be authorized to requisition all sailors in the country as soon as the President declares a state of alert (i.e., before declaring war on a foreign country) so that they can quickly respond to the emergency.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] The US budget for 1940 has been submitted to Congress for review. There is a significant shortfall, and the special defense budget is a special feature of this budget. The income is listed as $5,669,000,000, and the expenditure is listed as $8,995,000,000, resulting in a shortfall of $3,216,000,000. The defense budget is listed as $1,320,000,000, an increase of $309,000,000 over 1939. President Roosevelt stated in his message that special items in the special defense budget should be listed as temporary in nature. He also stated that the large-scale relief program is of great benefit, but the government will never implement it by drastic means. He also advocated that tax rates should be slightly increased compared to before. As for the increased defense expenditure of $309,000,000, $99,000,000 will be used to complete current projects, and the remaining $210,000,000 will be included in new projects. The government will submit this new plan to Congress for review in the future. In the budget expenditure, the relief fund is $2,266,000,000. Other major items include $721,000,000 for the Navy Department, $516,000,000 for the Army Department (including the Panama Canal Authority's expenses), and $706,000,000 for the Department of Agriculture. The President's message continued that the government has not wasted a single bit of the taxes paid by the people. On the contrary, most of the government's shortfall has been transformed into national wealth. As for the views of various parties that the ordinary budget must be able to maintain balance and that special budgets often cannot maintain balance, this statement is inaccurate. It is hoped that in years of economic prosperity, the national budget will have a surplus to make up for the shortfall in future years.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Copenhagen, 5th] It is rumored in political circles here that the Danish National Socialist Party will be banned by the government due to its "unpatriotic behavior."

<h3 id="e41">Britain Prepares to Unite with the US for Economic Retaliation Against Japan, Experts Advocate Raising Import Tariffs and Reducing Import Quotas for Japanese Goods <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th] Prime Minister Chamberlain held talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon this morning. It is reported that they discussed the issue of imposing economic retaliation on Japan, which is the only way to force Japan to treat British interests in China better. Regarding this matter, experts advocate raising import tariffs on Japanese goods in all territories of the British Empire and reducing import quotas. Chancellor Simon does not seem to agree, but the final decision of the British government depends on the attitude of the United States. Even if the United States does not take the same measures, as long as it takes similar measures, the British government can impose strong measures on Japan. In any case, it can be asserted that the amount of British credit loans to China will definitely be substantially increased.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th] It is generally believed that Prime Minister Chamberlain has decided to adopt a firmer attitude towards the dictatorial countries. Well-informed sources say that Britain's attitude towards Japan, Germany, and Italy will all become tougher. As for Japan, the British government seems to be waiting for the United States to make a decision on the issue of revising the Neutrality Act before contacting it to jointly impose economic pressure on Japan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The "Manchester Evening News" wrote today, "Relying on time to make Japan fail is impatient and ill-considered because Japan is currently using very economical methods to manage the war in China and may be able to obtain the benefits of managing Chinese resources in the short term. However, on the other hand, Japan is very dependent on export trade, and its gold reserves are almost exhausted. This is a very dangerous weakness of Japan, which is well known to President Roosevelt's advisors."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The "Financial Times" published an article today, saying, "It is clearly impractical for Western countries to directly interfere in China at present, but it is another matter for Britain to protect its economic interests. We are fully armed in this regard, and our weapons are sharp and tenacious, so we should use them. Today, Japan's 'fatal weakness' is not funds but markets, and Britain's international trade is very attractive. If Britain decides to completely exclude the import of Japanese goods, what in the world can stop Britain (or the United States) from implementing its determination? At the same time, since the issue of 'credit loans' to China is being discussed today, we should at least not neglect any opportunity to make Sino-British relations closer." The newspaper concluded, "If the British government does not cooperate with the United States and establish an understanding with the Chinese National Government, its negligence is intolerable."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] US Senator Clark predicted that Congress will prevent President Roosevelt from taking economic retaliation methods to oppose the perpetrators because this move will create "a state of war. Unless we are prepared for war, this matter will meet with severe opposition." When Italy invaded Abyssinia, it suffered economic sanctions, and Mussolini declared this "a state of war."</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain made a statement at 10 Downing Street today on President Roosevelt's address to Congress, saying, "All those who bear the heavy responsibility of governing cannot but be moved by President Roosevelt's heartfelt address to the representatives of the American people (i.e., members of Congress). People here deeply feel that only through freedom and peace can we make the welfare and prosperity that we have strived for generations grow. The feelings expressed by President Roosevelt point out the important duties of the American democratic country in the world and the ideals that the country is working for in human progress."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 6th] Newspapers here support Roosevelt's speech on international policy and defense policy, but they are dissatisfied with the President's domestic spending plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] It is learned that the German diplomatic community is very annoyed by US President Roosevelt's speech. However, it is generally expected that Germany will not file an official protest with the United States. The most likely development is that Hitler will deliver a speech at the German Parliament meeting on the 20th of this month to respond to President Roosevelt's speech. At present, it is still generally believed that the United States and Germany will sever diplomatic relations. Various circles in Germany point out that the United States is interfering in matters that have nothing to do with it and causing disputes. Germany is only defending itself.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th] The German press expressed anger at several points in President Roosevelt's speech to Congress yesterday. At the same time, they were even more angry at the speech of the chairman of the US Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, who said, "He believes that the US government has decided to not only protest in the future, but also implement moral and financial sanctions." The German press believes that Pittman's words are even stronger than President Roosevelt's broad statement.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 6th] The British Unemployed Workers Federation wired the King yesterday, requesting the immediate recall of Sir Anderson, who is currently on vacation in Switzerland. The telegram stated that Sir Anderson should immediately carry out air defense steps because the implementation of this step can accommodate a large number of unemployed workers. At the same time, the Unemployed Workers Federation issued a public statement, expressing dissatisfaction with the fact that the Minister of Home Security, Anderson, is currently on vacation abroad because many representatives are willing to discuss the issue of building air-raid shelters to accommodate some unemployed workers with Sir Anderson. The statement also pointed out that the construction of air-raid shelters can use skilled workers and also unskilled workers. In addition, the negotiations between the representatives of the unemployed workers and the Ministry of Labor regarding winter relief have not yielded any results.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th) Tokyo Foreign News, After repeated cabinet meetings in Japan, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters for the first time this morning. When a reporter asked about the Japanese government's attitude towards the US note of December 31, the spokesman replied that the wording of the US note was excellent and that it was currently being studied, so no comments could be made for the time being. As for whether the Japanese government will submit a reply, it has not been decided. Regarding the President's message to Congress, the spokesman refused to express an opinion. Next, a reporter asked about the drug trafficking situation in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. The Japanese spokesman said that the Japanese authorities have strict control over drug trafficking in the occupied areas and that all the statements made by the British newspapers are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "I believe that US Ambassador Grew's return home has no major political significance but may make it easier for the US government to understand the truth of the situation in the Far East." Regarding the possibility of the United States amending the Neutrality Act, the spokesman said, "The US business community has not made any statements."</p>

<p>× The new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry was transmitted by telegram as Machida yesterday, but it has now been confirmed as Yukio Sakurauchi. Special supplementary biographies of Sakurauchi and Minister of Health and Welfare Hisatada Hirose are as follows:</p>
<p>Sakurauchi, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, is from Shimane Prefecture and is currently 60 years old. He graduated from Waseda University. He was originally a member of the Seiyukai Party. After Takashi Hara was assassinated in 1921, Kiyoura Takahashi succeeded him as the president of the Seiyukai Party. Tatsuo Yamamoto and others defected from the party due to their opposition to Takahashi and formed the Seiyu Honto Party. Sakurauchi was also one of them. In 1927, the Seiyu Honto Party and the Kenseikai Party merged to form the Minseito Party, and Sakurauchi became an important member. In 1931, he was elected as the Secretary-General of the Minseito Party and joined the second Wakatsuki Cabinet as the Minister of Commerce and Industry in the same year. Later, he served as the chief executive of the Minseito Party and is currently a permanent advisor to the party. He has long been known as "Chief of Headquarters" in the party and belongs to the same faction as Chuji Machida, but recently he has been actively wooing the party's reformists. He seems to only have some sympathy for the new party movement and is not willing to formally participate in activities. In addition, Sakurauchi also has a considerable position in the business world. He participated in the establishment of the Japan Electric Light Company and served as the president of the Koto River Electric Power Company and a military advisor for several other companies. He recently resigned as the president of the electric power company not long ago.</p>
<p>Hirose, Minister of Health and Welfare, is from Yamanashi Prefecture and is 51 years old. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University. He has a very close relationship with Ushio Keisuke. When Ushio served as the Minister of Home Affairs in the Hirota Cabinet in 1936, Hirose served as the Director-General of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs. When Ushio recommended Keiho Yamamoto as the vice chairman of the Fukushi Foundation, a charitable organization, Hirose served as the chairman of the foundation's board of directors. In addition, Hirose also served as the executive secretary of the Population Problem Research Association. Recently, he served as the Vice Minister of Health and Welfare under Minister of Health and Welfare Kido. In this cabinet reshuffle, he was promoted from Vice Minister to Minister. He has the ability to handle social affairs and is a pro-military young bureaucrat. (The End)</p>

Moroccan Governor-General Noguès has arrived in Algiers to attend a military conference, which will be held tomorrow and chaired by Premier Daladier.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 6th] French Premier Daladier left here last night by ship to Algiers. After Daladier boarded the ship, he telegraphed French President Lebrun to express his gratitude for the public's loyalty to France in Tunisia. Daladier's current tour of Corsica, Tunisia, and Algiers will be made into a film, which will be shown in Paris next week for government officials and the diplomatic community to preview, and then publicly screened in the country.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tunis, 6th] According to French reports, in addition to strengthening the fortifications of Tunis and the various forts in North Africa, a second batch of Senegalese (West African) troops will set sail from Marseille today and head to French Somaliland in East Africa. It is reported that there are currently 97 battalions of fusiliers, 8 regiments of Spahis, and 30,000 troops of various types in French North Africa. At present, some parties in France are still planning to make major preparations as necessary, but Italy is not surprised at all and remains silent, observing how the future situation will evolve.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sousse, Tunisia, 5th] Arab Jews welcomed French Premier Daladier in El Jem today, saying, "Our protector is Daladier, not Mussolini. We need nothing other than France."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th] The Italian Consul-General in Tunisia protested to the Governor about the anti-Italian demonstrations during Daladier's visit and the repeated insults to the Italian flag, which aroused public anger among the Tunisian people.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th] It was officially announced that the representatives of various Italian groups in Tunisia have passed a resolution against France and sent the resolution to the Italian Consul-General in the area, requesting the Italian Consul to forward it to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The resolution emphasizes the inalienable rights guaranteed by a thousand-year-old tradition and treaties and expresses resentment at the continuous provocation and violence against Italians, as well as anger at the insults to the Italian flag. The resolution most firmly declares that the Italians in Tunisia are loyal to the Italian Emperor, Amedeo, and the Italian Prime Minister, Mussolini.</p>

<h3 id="e47">New Good News <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>At a time when fascist aggressors are setting fires of war everywhere, we are actually hearing President of the United States's speech and a declaration by the British Prime Minister. One cannot but recognize this as new good news for the New Year of 1939 and report it to the readers.</p>
<p>In a speech to Congress on the 4th, US President Roosevelt pointed out that Fascist aggressors were expanding the war, threatening the world, and threatening the essential religions, democracy and international good faith of the United States; Roosevelt then stated that if the United States required freedom, happiness, and the ability to fulfill its responsibilities to the world, it would have to resolutely prepare at any cost to stop the fascist aggression by force. Not only did this speech emphasize modifying current American foreign policy, national defense plans, and the Neutrality Act within the country, it also expanded the influence of the peace front internationally, providing new stimulus for democracies that were struggling, having recently succumbed to the aggression of Japan, Germany, and Italy. British Prime Minister Chamberlain also made a declaration on the 5th—in addition to expressing agreement with Roosevelt's speech, he specifically explained, "We welcome the feelings expressed by Roosevelt, recognizing this as another clear sign of America's important position in the world, and we know that America is enthusiastically supporting the ideals of human progress." These clear expressions by the heads of state of the United Kingdom and the United States demonstrate that the unity of the peaceful democratic countries has presented a brighter future, and also proves that our country's firm unity in resisting aggression possesses a brighter future. Today, we must take a more firm and correct stance, stand on the peace front, and redouble our efforts to oppose fascist aggressors. The light of victory has shone on the faces of every person who does not want to be a slave!</p>
<p>Intensify Cleaning Work</p>
<p>The international situation is improving day by day, domestic politics are progressing, and the situation of resistance against aggression has stabilized. These facts prove that we will embark on the road to victory this year. However, there are still many obstacles on this road to victory. What deserves special attention now is, first, the utter failure of Wang Jingwei's capitulation route, which has declared the decline of the German-Italian route advocated by the world as well, while his apologists and mouthpieces continue to use various methods to defend and decorate him, confusing people's minds. Second, although the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet of × country has exposed the seriousness of Japan's domestic and international crises, the succeeding Hiranuma Cabinet has made a tyrannical declaration to continue invading China. Judging by their absurd leaflet distribution on the 5th in Shanghai, it is enough to prove that the schemes of × people and traitors to divide and cause peace will intensify in the future—these are all obstacles on our road to victory that must be cleaned up. Chongqing has already launched a movement to clean up publications that hinder the national revolutionary resistance, and commanders from all over the country and local authorities have successively telegraphed their support for the central government's resistance against aggression and punishment of Wang, while civilian groups in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and compatriots in Southeast Asia, have also warmly telegraphed their support for the National Government and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, thoroughly rooting out traitors and insisting on resistance. Our ambassadors to the United Kingdom and France have also denounced the × traitors for their shameless rumors, but since the conspiracy activities of the × traitors have spread everywhere, everyone should set their minds and encourage themselves, assist the government, and start from their own surroundings to clear away these obstacles on the road to victory!</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, London, 6th) Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax held talks yesterday at the Prime Minister's official residence at Downing Street to discuss the European situation in preparation for next week's visit to Italy. On their way to Italy, the two plan to stop in Paris for about an hour, where the Prime Minister may take the opportunity to exchange views with the British Ambassador to France.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 6th) "Le Figaro" commented today on the British Prime Minister's visit to Rome, believing that if Italy cannot show good faith, Chamberlain will express a tougher attitude than former British Foreign Secretary Eden. The newspaper said that Chamberlain is a man of no illusions and strong religious beliefs, saying, "Chamberlain will travel a long way to appease Italy, but if the Italian side does not cooperate sincerely, so that this work cannot be completed, he must feel that he must take a firm attitude due to the pressure of British public opinion."</p>
<h3 id="e49">Counteroffensive by the Southwestern Government Army in Madrid; Heavy Losses for the Rebels, Fierce Fighting Ongoing; Bombing of Barcelona Was a Planned Act <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Spanish rebels occupied Brunete this morning. According to the Spanish News Agency, government troops have launched a counteroffensive southwest of Madrid, in Boadilla del Monte. Reports indicate the rebels suffered heavy losses and many were captured by the government forces. Fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Burgos, 6th] It is announced here that the National Army is advancing towards the Guadalajara line. In one to three days, they captured 238,844 government soldiers.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Paris, 6th] It is learned here that government troops suddenly occupied Valls, a small town twelve kilometers north of Senaroia, which is extremely important. The government Commander-in-Chief, Miaja, believes this counteroffensive can relieve the crisis on the Guadalajara line, just as Franco's troops attacked Valencia last July, only to be repelled by the Guadalajara troops across the Ebro River. It is noted that Miaja's troops are currently attacking an area rich in iron, tin, and lead mines. It is reported that government forces have cut off railway traffic between Pirenices and Sabadell.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The British Foreign Office today released the report of the British committee sent to Spain to investigate the air raids. The report states: "The evidence we have obtained proves that the bombing of Barcelona on New Year's Eve by the rebels was a planned act of harming human life. At the time of the bombing, the streets were extremely crowded with pedestrians. Most of the bombs dropped were lightweight bombs, unsuitable for bombing houses and ships. The time between the air raid siren and the start of the bombing was eight minutes, so 44 people were killed, 66 were seriously injured, and 25 were slightly injured."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The Spanish rebel authorities have falsely accused British officials, employees, and other personnel in San Sebastian, San Sebastián, and Burgos of improper conduct. British Foreign Secretary Halifax has ordered an investigation into all matters related to this accusation. The British Chargé d'Affaires in San Sebastian, O'Malley, and the British representative in Burgos, Jerram, will begin the investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Anglo-American Commercial Treaty and Anglo-American-Canadian Trade Relations <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The December report of the Royal Bank of Canada states: The recently announced US-Canada commercial treaty and the Central America commercial treaty make it possible to imagine the significance of the commercial relationship between them. The United States and Canada initially signed a commercial treaty in November 1935, which was implemented the following January, with a term of three years. During these three years, commerce between the two countries was greatly stimulated. Upon the expiration of the old treaty, a new treaty was signed, the establishment of which will further promote commercial development between the two countries, as can be expected.</p>
<p>According to official US statistics, in 1935, Canada's exports to the US were $286 million, and its imports from the US were $323 million, so the US had a surplus of $37 million. In 1936, the first year of the US-Canada commercial treaty, Canada's export trade increased to $376 million, mainly because the US suffered a drought that year, leading to a sharp increase in Canadian wheat, livestock, and other agricultural products exported to the US. There was also a large increase in the export of industrial products such as timber, especially from British Columbia. At the same time, exports to Canada also increased, but not by much. The total amount exported to Canada that year was $384 million, so the export volumes of the two countries were almost equal, with a difference of only $8 million. The following year, 1937, US exports to Canada increased significantly compared to the previous year, totaling $510 million, an increase of $126 million. Canada's exports were $399 million, an increase of $23 million. That year, the US trade surplus with Canada was $111 million, compared to only $8 million the previous year. Subsequently, the US economy declined, and due to abundant agricultural harvests, Canadian exports to the US plummeted. This trend continued into 1938. In the first eight months of 1938, Canadian product exports to the US fell to $162 million, compared to $279 million in the same period last year, while US exports to Canada remained strong, at $323 million, compared to $336 million in the same period last year. Therefore, in 1938, the US trade surplus with Canada reached $161 million.</p>
<p>Trade between the US and Canada occupies an important position in their foreign trade. For example, in 1930, the total exports of the US and Canada combined were over $1 million, of which US exports to Canada were $659 million, and Canadian exports to the US were $402 million. During the years of the US economic downturn, trade between the two countries also declined sharply. However, in the nine years from 1930 to 1938, the total exports of the two countries were approximately $650 million, of which US exports to Canada were $375 million, and Canadian exports to the US were $275 million. From this perspective, Canada accounts for one-seventh of the total US foreign trade volume, and the US trade surplus with Canada alone accounts for approximately $100 million, or one-fourth of the total US trade surplus. The second largest trade partner for the United States is the United Kingdom, although the total value is not as high as that with Canada, but the annual average total value from 1930 to 1938 was $569 million, of which US exports to the UK were $460 million, and UK exports to the US were $141 million. The largest portion of US exports to the UK is raw cotton. For example, in the year from July 1937 to July 1938, the UK purchased $85 million worth of US cotton, which is more than twice the amount purchased by any other country in the world (France ranked second with $40 million). In the past nine years, the US trade surplus with the UK has averaged $287 million annually. The UK is known to be a large importer, but it may not be widely known that US goods account for a large portion of its imports.</p>
<p>Over the nine years mentioned above, the US total export volume averaged $380 million annually. Within this figure, US exports to Canada were nearly $100 million, and exports to the UK reached $287 million. Therefore, it can be said that the US has consistently achieved a trade surplus in foreign trade over the past nine years, mainly due to these two countries.</p>
<p>Although the US and Canada bear a very significant role in terms of trade conditions, on the other hand, many Americans travel to Canada, spending large amounts of money, which in turn makes Canada's balance of payments with the US more favorable. Therefore, if we include this "trade created by tourism," the US has purchased more goods from Canada than Canada has purchased from the US since 1931. In the same example, the United States pays a large amount of money to foreign countries for shipping, insurance, etc., so based on the final conclusions of the two countries, the commercial conditions in the United Kingdom are much better than estimated based solely on export trade.</p>
<p>In modern times, all countries regard the amount of their export trade as determining the increase or decrease in the quantity of imports. Therefore, the balance of trade is of great importance. If the world were not the world it is today, but an ideal world, unconstrained by tariff policies and other commercial restrictions, then, according to economic principles, a country would purchase goods from the market with the lowest prices and sell goods in the market with the highest prices. Therefore, even if a country has an imbalance in its income and expenditure, it is not of great importance, because the mutual relations of other parties can quickly compensate for the omissions, and this is the reason. However, under the commercial policies dominated by nationalism, this problem becomes even more serious. At each meeting of the British Empire, the various departments of the British government are eager to obtain a greater share of the market in the member states. However, Argentina, Sweden, Norway and other countries are all large buyers of British goods, so the United Kingdom, when managing the number of its member states, cannot ignore the salvation of these countries. And because the United Kingdom absorbs such a large proportion of the export volume of countries all around the world, its member states and other countries have already made significant concessions to give them priority access to the United Kingdom. Therefore, if the United Kingdom wants to continue to buy the excess products of the United States, the limits imposed on the import of other countries will inevitably become narrower.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom's foreign investments are vast, so the UK had already recognized several years ago that a trade deficit was necessary, because purchasing goods from abroad would allow other countries to pay the interest on their investments. Due to this concession, the United Kingdom enjoys more favorable borrowing terms than other countries. Emerging countries generally lack resources. Therefore, during commercial recessions, the responsibility for maintaining world financial stability must fall on resource-rich developed countries. If countries can support international trade in good faith, without restrictions, and without being concerned about trade deficits, allowing free entry and exit, then this will greatly alleviate the current global difficulties. As a result, emerging countries will be able to continue to fulfill their debt obligations. The United Kingdom has consistently been a large net importer during this period, and without minding it, its contribution to the revival of world commerce is indeed significant. However, the recovery of world commerce will ultimately enable the domestic and foreign trade of the United Kingdom to benefit equally and achieve progress.</p>

<h3 id="e51">On the Policy that Britain Should Adopt towards the Far East <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London, British merchants are very anxious about the "New Order in East Asia" that the Japanese militarists intend to implement, because this move by Japan is actually just an excuse to exclude the interests of third countries in China, in order to achieve its goal of monopolizing East Asia. A prominent British businessman, Mr. Li, wrote a letter to the London "Times" the day before yesterday, saying: "In the past, at least in theory, Japan still allowed the existence of the open-door policy and the Nine-Power Treaty when the Manchurian Incident occurred, but in its plan to establish a 'New Order' in the Far East, it has already obliterated them…" He then listed the examples of how British trade had been excluded and reduced to less than one percent after Japan annexed "Manchuria". In addition, the "Daily Telegraph" also published an article expressing its anger at Japan's implementation of the Monroe Doctrine in East Asia, which damages the interests of Western powers. We believe that the anxiety of British merchants is extremely correct, and their understanding of Japan's attempt is extremely clear. Perhaps only those who have suffered themselves will feel it so keenly.</p>
<p>Recently, the United States and Britain, seeing that the Japanese militarists are determined to destroy international conventions and monopolize Asia, and have no intention of "reining in at the edge of a cliff," have decided to jointly lend funds to China, which will provide us with a lot of assistance in transportation construction and the war of resistance, especially in terms of spiritual encouragement. The Chinese people, who are in the midst of today's difficult and dangerous war of resistance, express their infinite gratitude for this righteous act. However, for the sake of world peace and the interests of the great powers, especially Britain, in the Far East, it is necessary for Britain to take a further and more active policy towards the Far East from any point of view. Recently, the United States' policy towards Japan has gradually taken active and tough steps, driven by public opinion on the one hand and by the demands of domestic merchants on the other. The reason for the US government's strong note to Japan on October 6 last year was this. Japan's reply to the United States on November 18 last year was full of sophistry, which the US government considered unsatisfactory, and it sent another note to Japan on the 31st of last month, reiterating the US government's opinion. The note refuted Japan's exclusion of the businesses of American expatriates, placing Japanese citizens in a superior position, and violating certain international conventions. It particularly expressed its disapproval of the so-called "adaptation to the new situation in East Asia" and "construction of a new order in East Asia" that Japan intends to implement, and will take action in practice. It is heard that the 76th Congress will discuss this issue. It seems that the United States is ready to impose sanctions on Japan at a fairly mature stage.</p>
<p>Since the United States has such a determination towards the situation in the Far East, Britain, which has a long history of a hundred years in Asia and whose rights and interests are several times greater than those of the United States, should take this opportunity to further cooperate closely with the United States and other democratic countries such as the Soviet Union and France, and adopt a tough policy to quickly sanction the violent Japan. Not only will the rights and interests of the British Empire in China be protected from damage, but the war can be ended sooner, and many innocent people in China can be spared the tragic death under the brutal planes and artillery of the Japanese militarists!</p>
<p>Since Mr. Leith-Ross helped China reform its currency system in November 1935, there has been a closer economic relationship between China and Britain than in the past, and British investment in China has been increasing day by day. In recent years, British investment has been the largest in the capital for railway construction in China. In terms of trade, in 1936, the year before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, exports from the UK and its major colonies to China accounted for 21.62% of China's total imports, and imports from China accounted for 31.87% of China's total exports. The total of exports and imports accounted for 26.01% of China's foreign trade, ranking first compared with the US and Japan. The United States was second, and Japan was third. Even after the outbreak of the war, until the first half of 1938, British trade with China still ranked first. As for 80% of the total Chinese bank capital of 760 million and 60% of the industrial capital were in Shanghai under British influence. According to the statistics of 1936, the UK also ranked first in the shipping power on the coast and inland rivers of China, more than twice that of Japan. However, since Japan launched its war of aggression, the UK's transportation capacity has gradually decreased to less than a quarter by the first half of last year. After the loss of Wuhan and Guangzhou, British influence in China was almost completely driven out by Japan, and the losses in Hong Kong were even greater. Recently, the Japanese militarists have intensified their efforts, using military relations as an excuse to block the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, not allowing foreign ships to sail, and using all kinds of despicable means to exclude foreign businessmen from operating businesses. All travel and residence of foreigners in the occupied areas are subject to various restrictions, so that they will cut off their traces as soon as possible. If the Japanese militarists can permanently occupy the occupied areas of China today, then no place will be allowed for foreigners to have room for activity! The opposition of British businessmen to the deceptive "new order" promoted by the Japanese militarists and their advocacy of a tough policy are appropriate measures.</p>
<p>The mad fascist Kiichirō Hiranuma has replaced Konoe as Prime Minister. In this final stage of struggle, the Japanese military's war of aggression against China will be more intense and brutal, and the exclusion of foreign interests will be more active. In fact, the first to bear the brunt will naturally be the United States and Britain, especially Britain, which has the most rights and interests in China. Yesterday, the Japanese "Tokyo Newspaper" boldly stated: Regardless of how the United States opposes it, regardless of how the United States and Britain adopt cooperation methods, the Japanese government is determined to adhere to its determination to establish a new order in East Asia. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also made similar remarks, saying that Japan will continue to advance towards the path of organizing the "Japan-Manchukuo-China Economic Group" according to its determination, and stated that the first voice of the Hiranuma Cabinet to the outside world would be a firm rejection of the US note of the 31st of last month. Japan's development in the Far East and the interests of Britain and the United States are absolutely incompatible, which is already clear. On the 4th, US President Roosevelt's speech in Congress seemed to imply that the United States would impose economic sanctions on Japan and Germany, and the movement for sanctions against Japan in the United States is becoming more enthusiastic. Since the United States is prepared to impose severe sanctions on Japan, if the United Kingdom ×××××××××××, France will certainly be able to participate, and the Soviet Union, which has always advocated peace, has no reason to stay out of it. If this is the case, the rights and interests of the United Kingdom in the East can be protected, and world peace can be re-established. The time has come, and the wise British politicians must have "a well-thought-out plan in mind"!</p>
<h3 id="e52">Guilin Impressions <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhangqun</p>
<p>[Special Correspondence from Guilin] After we arrived in Guilin, many friends, regardless of whether we knew them or not, local or from Hengyang and other places, almost invariably asked us about the truth of the war situation and the prospects for the war of resistance.</p>
<p>[Is there any talk of "peace"?] "Is peace possible?"</p>
<p>We heard such questions everywhere. This, to us who had just left Ganzhou, a city full of refugees and wailing souls in the wilderness; and Wuzhou and Liuzhou, which were experiencing air raid alarms several times a day and were filled with grief and indignation, was like a bolt from the blue. The hateful rumour-mongers were acting as if it were true, and no matter how we explained it, the air of compromise and peace still hung heavily over the hearts of the people of Guilin. Those who were well-fed and hoping for "peace" out of selfish motives had become the broadcasting stations for spreading rumours, even detailing the conditions for "peace": first, second… fifth. "Peace" was not only hoped for by our side; the × people, finding themselves in a difficult position, were also hoping for it. They spoke with an air of "knowing oneself and knowing the enemy." They said that a certain director had received secret information confirming that the rumours were not false, that a certain important person had stopped the planned relocation to the countryside, and that a certain chief had also hinted at the imminent arrival of "peace" during a commemorative week. They exhausted their efforts to present the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan as the basis for the inevitable arrival of "peace," and this spread like wildfire. It was as if "everything was settled." In this atmosphere, even those who were considered to have a deeper understanding of current affairs were inevitably misled and began to waver. This created a situation where the whole of Guilin was plunged into a quagmire of confusion. We believe that this is a phenomenon that absolutely must not be allowed to happen, especially in Guilin, which is meant to be the base for the future war of resistance, as the second phase of the war of resistance is just beginning. Therefore, we did our best to explain and correct the rumours. In recent days, we have emphasized the following points in our conversations with individuals, visits to social organizations and government agencies, and meetings with public officials, in order to illustrate that we are determined to persevere in the war of resistance to the end, and that only by fighting to the end can we achieve final victory.</p>
<p>First, compromise is enough to destroy the country - Under the current circumstances, there is absolutely no benefit for us to be gained from any peace negotiations. The × people, believing that they have won, will surely place us in the position of "signing a treaty under the city walls." In reality, the distinction between victory and defeat is not yet decided. Moreover, today's results were expected before the war of resistance, as a necessary process during the war of resistance. We are willing to make any sacrifice and resolutely fight because of the independence of the country, and the restoration of national dignity. Unless those goals are achieved, we must not stop fighting. The facts of the past year and a half, although we have suffered many losses, show that we are becoming stronger as we fight, and the morale is higher than ever before. The restoration of the nation has begun to show signs of progress. If compromise is possible today, there would have been no war of resistance. Who doesn't understand that our war of resistance is to seek life in death, and compromise is tantamount to giving up the only way to survive and heading to one's death. Who doesn't understand that the internal contradictions and difficulties of the × people will continue to be revealed as we continue to resist. This is enough for us to resolutely see through the path of "compromise midway, enough to destroy the country" and actively implement the mission of long-term resistance.</p>
<p>Second, the defeatists have not been completely eliminated - Trees do not move without wind. The rumours of "peace" certainly did not come out of thin air. Because there are still defeatists in our ranks, and there are still people among our officials and scholars who are unwilling to let go of the illusion of "peace." This is the breeding ground for "peace" and compromise. However, these defeatists initially attempted "peace" because they could not resist the tide of resisting × and saving the nation. In other words, the objective situation was all geared towards resistance, and it was clear that resistance was the only way to establish oneself and survive. Therefore, the defeatists' advocacy of peace never had a chance to succeed. The current objective situation has not only not changed in the slightest from before the war of resistance, but has strengthened the demand for resistance. In addition, all parties and factions can cooperate more sincerely, and the national consciousness among the people has increased dramatically. All of this is enough to give a major blow to those who advocate peace. Therefore, we say that although those who advocate peace are still agitating, the crisis of compromise may not have been completely eliminated. But the objective situation of resistance has not diminished, and compromise is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Third, the dawn of victory is faintly visible. In this year or so of war of resistance, we have learned everything. Not only has there been considerable progress in military strategies for fighting the × people. There are signs of gradual enlightenment in politics, that is, internally we also know who is patriotic and who is a traitor, and corrupt elements are gradually being eliminated, and patriotic people are gradually having their chance to show their abilities. These are all predictions of victory. Although we still have many weaknesses that cannot be tolerated, it is a fact that everyone can recognize them and is gradually eliminating them and gradually improving them. Our strength is infinite. Now we are gradually learning the technique of using this force. Everyone understands that the only condition for the victory of the war of resistance is whether or not the mission of general mobilization can be completed. But this most difficult task of general mobilization is already being actively worked on and will surely bear fruit.</p>
<p>Based on many facts, we cited the remarks of the supreme leader to prove that after the fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, we will inevitably continue to resist, and that it will not hinder the conditions for the victory of the war of resistance. Here, we want to specifically point out that the Guangxi Daily in Guilin can also play the mission of leading public opinion and correcting rumours. I remember it was November 8th (?), the newspaper published an editorial in a solemn and straightforward manner, entitled "Eliminating Defeatists." The content of the article stated the facts that persisting in the war of resistance to the end will surely lead to final victory, and the conclusion pointed out that it is excusable for ignorant people to misunderstand rumours and seek trouble for themselves. However, it is unforgivable for public officials, even those in leadership positions, to waver in their confidence in the future of the war of resistance, not only showing their lack of common sense, but also influencing people's hearts. We admire the newspaper's correct arguments and far-sighted vision. However, judging from the facts pointed out by the newspaper, it can be seen how strong the "peace" atmosphere was in Guilin at that time, and that there were many people who believed in rumours.</p>
<p>Facts speak louder than eloquence. Rumours, after all, cannot escape the scope of rumours. Chairman Chiang's letter to the people and the resolutions of the Political Council, like sunshine, swept away the "peace" mist that enveloped Guilin. In particular, after Chairman Huang returned from Changsha (at that time, it was widely rumoured in Guilin that the Changsha meeting attended by Chairman Huang was to decide on the issue of war or peace), the "peace" atmosphere immediately disappeared into thin air. Later, more and more people came to Guilin from Hengyang. We learned from Chairman Huang and many others about the new strategies decided at the Changsha meeting for the second phase of the war of resistance. It is said that our decision to fight to the end this time is based on three important factors: (1) The combat power of the × people is declining day by day. According to statistics from the battlefields of Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Hankou, it is almost becoming a declining line. On the contrary, our side is gradually increasing, and a certain army that has never participated in the war in the past and has been recuperating has decided to participate in the war. Therefore, we are confident in resisting or counterattacking: (2) In terms of the supply of military supplies, although there have been changes and difficulties due to international routes, the military supplies we have obtained have been imported at 70% of the planned amount, which is sufficient for several years: (3) There is confidence in solving financial and economic problems. This is not only in terms of foreign aid, but also in terms of our own strength, there are still many good policies to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, which will not hinder the war of resistance; (4) Domestic unity is becoming closer. Representatives of the Eighth Route Army, such as Zhou Enlai, participated in the Changsha meeting, which was an unprecedented phenomenon.</p>
<p>The many messages listed above were passed on from reliable people, confirming our explanation and strengthening our determination to resist. The atmosphere in Guilin has changed from pessimistic, negative, and wavering to tense, positive, and calm.</p>
<p>The provincial government had long foreseen the brutality of enemy air raids on Guilin. In addition to organizing the people to take refuge in an organized manner, it also decided to evacuate women and children. In addition, the military situation in Yueyang was extremely tight, and the shocking fire in Changsha occurred one after another in a short period of time, and Guilin was naturally subjected to tremendous shocks, forming an orderly wavering. Showing another kind of unusual phenomenon.</p>
<p>The crowds pouring in from Hengyang, the words "torrent" and "sea of people" are really not enough to describe even one ten-thousandth of it. What was then manifested in Guilin was the problem of food and housing.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war of resistance, the small city of Guilin has seen new restaurants springing up like bamboo shoots after the rain. Together with the existing ones, the total number has exceeded one hundred. No matter when you step into these hundred or so restaurants, big or small, the first impression is that they are full. Sometimes, if you are lucky enough to find a seat, after waiting impatiently for some time, the dishes you ordered arrive one after another. After you finish the first bowl of rice, the second bowl either requires you to wait some more time, or you will get this perfunctory answer: "The rice is not ready... It's too late... Wait another thirty minutes." No matter how much you are willing to pay, it is never easy to get your fill. This is the problem of food. As for the problem of accommodation, there is a similar situation. The newly established hotels are not few in number. However, at 11 o'clock in the evening, the doors are always tightly closed. At two or three o'clock in the middle of the night, the guests pouring in from the Xiang-Gui Road break down the door with their fists, but the hotel owner still pretends to be deaf and dumb. Later, the people looking for a room understood that they had to shout loudly outside the hotel door, "Mr. So-and-so," indicating that they were looking for a friend. As soon as the hotel owner opened the door, they swarmed in, and in the accounting room, on the corridor, in any place where there was an empty space, they spread out their bedding and slept. "How much money do you want, I'll give you how much." The hotel owner was indeed unable to cope, and could open his mouth and ask for a rental fee of one or two yuan per night at will, and was happy to pretend to be deaf and dumb again. The prices of all items, compared to before the war, are said to have increased many times, but this is not a problem for the travelers, only the poor locals suffer.</p>
<p>In addition to food and housing, what is not easy to solve in Guilin is the transportation problem. The locals have long understood that the wooden houses in Guilin cannot withstand burning, and since the government has decided to evacuate, everyone is of course rushing to leave Guilin. The people from Hengyang, except for a very small number who stayed in Guilin to work, were mostly passing through, resulting in fewer cars than passengers, and transportation has become a serious problem that is difficult to solve. The population flowing into Guilin from various places is in the thousands every day, but the number of cars leaving Guilin is no more than two per day, of course, it cannot solve the problem of evacuation. According to reliable sources, tickets from Liuzhou to Guiyang have been registered until March next year. People whose destination is Chongqing or Kunming cannot solve the problem by walking, so they can only stay in Guilin. This adds to the difficulties of food and housing. There are many people wandering on the streets because they have run out of travel expenses, and there are many who are begging for mercy. Although the Guangxi authorities have regulations on the reception of refugees and the establishment of reception centers, what they can solve is only the tip of the problem.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to point out that there are still many serious and urgent problems that need to be solved and are very easy to solve.</p>
<p>(1) The difficulty in solving the problem of food and housing lies in the fact that there is no prevention or interference with the hoarding of goods by various business owners, and many public institutions, such as guild halls and temples, are still allowed to remain empty without being utilized. This is a great loss. If these places can be utilized more systematically, and at the same time, the management methods of hotels and restaurants can be distributed, the problem of food and housing can be easily solved.</p>
<p>(2) Like monsters, trucks retreating from the front to the rear have the words "Military Abandonment" on the front, but most of the contents they carry are sofas, wooden furniture, leather suitcases, and buckets. It is said that many important items lack military personnel and cannot be transported out, but carrying these things is really heartbreaking. With the price of electricity and oil being very high and in short supply today, carrying furniture is really not worth the price of electricity and oil. This unreasonable phenomenon must be paid attention to by those in charge.</p>
<p>(3) Electricity and oil are very expensive and in short supply. The call to save electricity and oil and to control electricity and oil is deafening, but we still see young masters and young ladies driving around for pleasure.</p>
<p>(4) Electricity and oil are very scarce in Guilin, and each can sells for 20 yuan in national currency. Sometimes you can't buy spot goods even if you have money. It is said that there is a lot of stock in Longzhou, and each can only sells for 8 yuan. But we see many empty cars returning from Longzhou to Guilin. Why can't we use them to transport oil to make up for the shortage? This is a serious organizational problem. Electricity and oil are just one example, and other materials have the same strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>(5) Transportation is very scarce. However, there are still cases of fraud in car dealerships, even in official road bureaus. For example, from Xupu to Guilin, the fixed price is 6 yuan and 7 jiao in national currency, but some people have paid 25 yuan in national currency. It is said that car tickets are first bought out by people and then sold at high prices. Therefore, some passengers cannot find a place to buy tickets, even if they are willing to pay a high price, they cannot get them, and they have stayed in extremely simple small hotels for seven or eight days. However, in this situation of such crowded passengers, due to the above-mentioned fraud, there are actually empty seats in the car when it drives out. This is the reality that is happening in our ideal Guangxi. It is said that other places are even more chaotic. This is a phenomenon that must be corrected quickly!</p>
<h3 id="e53">Xie Jinyuan, Leader of the Isolated Army in Shanghai, Observations and Thoughts on the Current Situation over the Past Year <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondence of this Newspaper) Time flies like water. The twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China has arrived in an instant. Because of mental uneasiness, I was hospitalized for treatment. Following the doctor's advice, I eliminated all the complexities. As for colleagues in the media requesting me to write an article stating my observations over the past year, I was unable to comply for a while. Recently, colleagues in the isolated island have been frequently asking about the truth and future trends due to Wang Jingwei's defection. I am always optimistic about the future of the war of resistance. I have said in the past that our country's military has absolute confidence in victory. If there are any problems, it is in politics. But political problems are not irredeemable. Because our country has a large population and vast space, after a long period of war of resistance, it will be able to make all political problems get on the right track along with the development of the military. In particular, today's soldiers in our country are inspired by the great selfless spirit of our supreme leader, and the revolutionary education of national and national supremacy has made the thinking of modern soldiers almost advance by leaps and bounds. As for Wang's past, he only took a part of the responsibility in the party and the country. The words and actions of the Ning-Han split, and the measures of the enlarged meeting, when proved by today's escape, the impact on the major strategy of resisting the war and building the country is, at most, to confuse the public and give the enemy an opportunity to provoke and create rumors.</p>
<p>I believe that Wang is an idealistic empty talker, lacking a strong and consistent revolutionary belief. Judging from his past revolutionary history, he should not abandon his people and associate with traitors. Especially at this critical juncture of the country, it is by no means that one or two telegrams or lengthy speeches can help. Wang's move is enough to expose the declining fate of a few wavering elements within the country, and make the foundation of domestic unity against foreign aggression stronger. I originally had an article "The Knowledge that the Chinese People Should Have During the War of Resistance," which was to be published on New Year's Day, but it did not materialize due to illness. In short, the people in this great era should have an absolutely rational and calm mind to grasp their beliefs and clarify right and wrong. If they are overly nervous and ignore reality, it will only trap the country in the great disease of frivolity, impetuosity, and empty talk. I especially hope that the media will strive to take the initiative and bear the responsibility. For all confusing and incomplete news, do not exaggerate too much, lest it shake the people's confidence in the war of resistance. The current all-out war of resistance was originally a consistent policy of the government. Five years ago, there were detailed plans. Therefore, Wang's every word and action will never affect the national policy of resisting the war. This is just a clear division between the virtuous and the traitors in the process of resisting the war. Today, we must recognize that only by vowing to support Chairman Chiang can we win the final victory in the war of resistance. Chairman Chiang is the only great man who continues the past and opens up the future, carries forward and promotes the 5,000-year history and culture of our country, and is the leader who lays the foundation for the prosperity of the nation for generations to come. The people must recognize that the soul of the nation and the nation is tied to Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang's soul is also the soul of our nation and the people. From now on, the people can only follow the meaning of "the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone," and do their duty in their respective positions, exhaust their duties, and take the supreme leader's advocacy as their advocacy, and their will as their will, and work hard to serve the country in a down-to-earth manner. Fellow islanders, at the beginning of this year, I hope that everyone will review the responsibilities they have fulfilled in the year and a half of the war of resistance. At a time when hundreds of thousands of frontline soldiers are fighting to the death, and tens of millions of compatriots in the war zone are displaced, can the islanders watch the fire from across the bank by virtue of their special environment? Staying on the island, I sincerely appeal to the islanders that the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China will be the year of our country's war of resistance and national construction. I deeply hope that the islanders will step up their efforts to serve the motherland and contribute money and effort to complete the foundation of national mobilization. In particular, the movement to repay debts of one yuan is even more the duty of every citizen, and must be promoted universally, extending to the old and the young. Then, by gathering small contributions, the combination of the power of 450 million people will surely form a strong Great Wall, and the future of the war of resistance will surely be promising. Otherwise, if the country is destroyed and the family is destroyed, I am afraid that we will become the second Jews, and we may not even be able to obtain that. As the New Year begins, I deeply hope that my compatriots will strive for it.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Southwest Economic Construction Committee Engages in Developing Rich Resources. Six Provinces have Very Abundant Reserves. Inconvenient Transportation and Backward Industry are the Main Reasons. <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Our government has established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee to develop and build the southwest and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. The ministers of various departments and the chairmen of the southwest provinces have been appointed as members. Preparations have been completed and the committee will be established in Chongqing on New Year's Day of the 28th year. In addition to the government issuing huge sums of money as funds, Hu Wenhu invested 50 million yuan, and various banks decided to assist in the completion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Agriculture The total area of the six provinces is 260 million mu, and the cultivated area is 31.7 million mu, accounting for 15% of the total area. The situation in each province is the highest in Guangxi, accounting for 25%, the lowest in Yunnan, accounting for 4%, and others such as Guangdong accounting for 12%, Hunan accounting for 13%, Guizhou accounting for 8%, and Sichuan accounting for 15%. The main agricultural product is rice.</p>
<p>Rice accounts for 47% of the national output, of which Guangdong ranks first, Sichuan Province ranks second, and Hunan Province ranks third. Although silk and tea are specialties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the silk of Sichuan and Guangdong and the tea of Hunan and Hubei are also quite famous. In addition, the most important agricultural product is tung oil. Sichuan Province alone produces up to 600,000 dan per year. As for cotton production, it is very small. Sichuan produces about 750,000 dan, Hunan produces about 400,000 dan, and Guangdong produces only 6,000 dan.</p>
<p>Industry</p>
<p>Industry is extremely weak due to the competition from foreign goods and foreign capital. This situation is especially true in the southwest provinces. Although there are few foreigners who set up factories in these six provinces, the competition from imported foreign goods is very fierce. The main reason for the backwardness of industry in the southwest provinces is the backwardness of transportation. It is inconvenient to obtain raw materials and circulate products. Therefore, industry has a feeling of being difficult to stand on its own. The largest modern industrial yarn factories in the southwest provinces are only two, namely Guangdong Textile Factory and Hunan First Textile Factory. The newly established ones later are Hunan Hengzhong Iron Works, Sichuan Jiabin Textile Factory, and Yunnan Textile Factory. The flour mills are Hunan First Factory in Changsha and Xinxin Flour Mill in Changde. However, sugar mills are more developed, but they are also limited to Sichuan and Guangdong provinces. Alcohol factories are mainly in Guangdong and Guangxi, and Hunan and Sichuan are also planning. Sichuan has the most match factories, with a total of 46 factories. Hunan and Guangxi each have one factory, Guangdong has one or five, and Yunnan has eight factories. In addition, there are about 200 factories for papermaking, silk reeling, sulphuric acid, brick making, rubber, cement machinery, etc.</p>
<p>Mining The mineral resources in the southwest provinces are extremely rich, with gold, silver, steel, iron, tin, manganese, zinc, lead, coal, petroleum, and salt. In particular, tin, manganese, antimony, etc. occupy a very high position in the world. Coal and iron are not as prosperous as in the northern provinces. (1) Iron ore reserves are about 299.616 million tons, (2) Coal reserves are about 1.5535 billion tons, (3) Manganese ore production is about 31,200 tons per year, (4) Antimony ore production is about 1,825 tons per year, (5) Gold production is about 31,206 taels per year, (6) Silver production is about 121,504 taels per year, (7) Tungsten production is about 11,410 tons per year, (8) Tin production is about 7,398 tons per year, (9) Antimony production is about 13,260 tons per year, (10) Lead production is about 6,670 tons per year, (11) Bismuth production is about 1,305 tons per year, (12) Petroleum production is about 400 barrels per year.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>The railways in the six provinces are insufficient and lack connection, and other transportation tools are not perfect. Therefore, to develop the rich resources in the southwest, it is advisable to engage in construction. (1) Railways The railways recently started by the government are the Chuanhai Railway from Xufu, Sichuan to Kunming, Yunnan, the Dianmian Railway from Kunming, Yunnan to Myitkyina, Burma, the Xiangqian Railway from Hengzhou, Hunan to Guiyang, Guizhou, and the Guiqian Railway from Guiyang, Guizhou to Kunming, Yunnan. Those in the plan are the Sichuan-Gui Railway, the Guiqian Railway, the Guangdong-Yue Railway, and the Shicheng Guide Railway. (2) Highways The highways in the southwest are more developed than in other provinces. The six provinces have a total of about 27,000 kilometers of roads that have been opened to traffic, accounting for one-quarter of the country, such as the Gandian Road, the Chuangui Road, the Guichuang Road, the Xianggui Road, the Chuanxiang Road, the Chuandian Road, the Yuegan Road, the Egang Road, the Xiange Road, the Guibei Road, the Shaanqian Road, the Guihong Road, and the Chuan'e Road. The newly completed ones are the Burma Road.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Assassination Cases in Shanghai Break Records. Last Year Can Be Called a Year of Terror <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 6th] Last year was the year with the most political crimes in the history of Shanghai. There were 37 assassination cases and attempted assassination cases. Both China and Japan tried to consolidate their political positions, resulting in mutual shootings. This political incident was the sacrifice of war. There was one former Prime Minister, one general, 20 Chinese officials who sold out the country, and many other people of all countries, such as educators, bankers, businessmen, and lawyers. Among them were those who had studied in the United States. This situation is extremely complicated, because not only are there conflicts between pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese people, but also pro-Japanese people often have conflicts due to political struggles for status.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Victory Reported on Two Routes in Northeastern Guangdong: Counter-Offensive Military Operations Continue to Progress; Xijiang [West River] × Increases Attempts to Encroach on Guangxi <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[North River Quick Dispatch] Our military counter-offensive against Guangdong has entered a new stage, with considerable gains in Zengcheng on the eastern route and Conghua on the northern route. Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, has been convening senior generals at the base for several days to discuss further strategies for counter-attacking Guangzhou. It has been decided to take advantage of the momentum and advance on Guangzhou with the main force from the northeast on two routes, employing a large encirclement strategy. Detailed military plans have been finalized and distributed to generals on all routes for implementation. It is reported that after our forces on the eastern route defeated the main force of the Zengcheng ×, they have continued to advance. Meanwhile, in the Longmen-Conghua area, a unit of our army has also launched a large-scale southward advance, with one detachment reaching the Zhengguo-Tiantou area and another reaching Paitan. Thus, the left flank of the northern route has linked up with our eastern route forces, completely encircling the periphery of Guangzhou's × troops with a long, diagonal line. After further deployment and replenishment, they will launch a coordinated assault on Guangzhou. As for the Xijiang area, although a large number of × reinforcements have arrived in the Sanshui-Xinan-Makou area, attempting to advance westward into Guangxi and outflank the right wing of our northern route, we have strong defensive positions in Gaoyao, Gaoming, and Heshan. × will certainly not succeed. Currently, the Guangdong war situation is developing into a rapid advance in the northeast and a defensive posture in the southwest.</p>
<p>[Wengyuan Quick Dispatch] According to a high-ranking official from the Fourth War Zone Command whom I interviewed, after the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, our second phase of the War of Resistance began, and nearly three months have passed. The war situation in Hunan, Hubei, and South China has stabilized and is rapidly shifting from a passive to an active position. This is due to the results of our implementation of a strategy combining mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare. Investigations reveal that the × troops on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway and those in Naxi have suffered repeated heavy blows in Yuezhou, Pingjiang, Xiangyin, and Zaoshi, with casualties exceeding 100,000. On the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and in Zengcheng and Dongguan on the eastern route, units under the Fourth War Zone have advanced towards Guangzhou in separate columns. Simultaneously, guerrilla teams in various districts have advanced to the outskirts of Guangzhou and the key points of Humen. Therefore, the × troops find it extremely difficult to operate in Guangdong. Recently, they planned to shorten the outer defense line of Guangzhou and increase reinforcements of naval fleets, attempting to land on the coasts of Beihai, Dianbai, and Yangjiang on the southern route, in a delusional attempt to invade Guangxi and cut off our southwestern international lines of communication. However, they retreated without success. In the past week, × has again withdrawn troops from Guangzhou, Zengcheng, and Dongguan to reinforce Jiujiang and Sanshui, desperately launching a westward attack on Gaoyao in the hope of opening up the Xijiang route to invade Guangxi and make a final military struggle. However, western Guangdong has strategic terrain and strong troops. To the east, the mountains on both sides of the Lingyang Gorge face each other, choking the flow of the East River, with a momentum like a galloping horse. The terrain is similar to the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Guangxi is also mountainous, with complex ravines. If mountain warfare is launched, it will not be suitable for the heavy weapons of the × army, and × will inevitably suffer heavy losses.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Fierce Fighting Continues in Western Shanxi; ×'s Advance Has Been Repulsed and Most Are Fleeing Northward; Traces of × Discovered at Various Passes East of the Yellow River <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] Military intelligence reports that the number of × troops attacking the Lüliang Mountains this time is approximately 7,000 or more. They began operations on the 25th and 26th of last month. One force of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 troops attacked Tumen-Heilongguan from Linfen, while another force infiltrated Guojiazhuang from Xiangling. Another force attacked Xiangning from Jishan, and another attacked Xigukou from Hejin, with approximately 4,000 to 5,000 troops on these two routes. After being severely attacked by our forces, the × troops at Changjiazhuang turned north to join up with the × troops at Linfen and invaded Puxian-Daning, suffering heavy casualties from constant ambushes by our troops along the way. Tumen and Heilongguan have been successively recovered by our forces, and the × troops' rear route has been cut off, causing great panic. The × troops that attacked north from Jishan joined up with the × troops at Xigukou and successively invaded Xiangning-Jixian on the 30th and 31st, attempting to continue their westward invasion. After three days of fierce fighting, the × troops were greatly repulsed, and most of the remaining × troops fled northward, seemingly intending to join up with the forces at Daning and attack the ferry crossing. The Shanxi × troops also increased by more than 5,000 on the 25th of last month, with one part increasing troops in Lishi-Zhongyang and another increasing troops in Jiugu to attack Xixian. After being severely attacked by our forces at Shijiazhuang, the × troops that advanced from Lishi on the 29th through Shiguan have taken no further action. According to reports, a unit of the × troops at Shilou infiltrated Xinguang, where they are currently engaged in battle with one of our units.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] Around New Year's Day, our forces took advantage of the × troops' unpreparedness and launched surprise attacks on the section between Ningwu and Shuoxian, inflicting heavy damage on the × troops. (1) Our detachment destroyed four or five miles of the Dashahe Railway, cut seven or eight miles of electric wires, and destroyed a certain place on the 2nd at Yangfangkou. Approximately 2,000 jin of electric wires and iron wires were transported back. (2) The × troops at Qianzhai were surrounded and attacked by our unit on the 2nd. After more than two hours of fierce fighting, the × troops were defeated and fled towards the station. Many × troops were killed in this battle, and many spoils of war were seized. (3) Our unit destroyed about a mile of railway and three miles of electric wires north of Ningwu. The transportation of × troops between Shuo and Ning has now been blocked.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, 5th] According to reports from the front lines, two small gunboats of the × army patrolling the river in the Xindi, Bailuoji, Chenglingji, and Yueyang areas have now retreated downstream. The discipline of the × army in Xindi is extremely poor. For days, they have been looting food and property in the surrounding villages in batches, causing unbearable suffering to the residents, who are fleeing one after another.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhanggongdu, 5th] (1) After our Lushan guerrilla unit won a victory in an attack on the ×, the × quickly gathered more than 700 troops and launched a large-scale counter-attack on our Baoguo Temple and Biyu Temple. Our regiment bravely engaged them in fierce fighting throughout the afternoon. The × suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards the Lanqiao area. (2) On the 1st, our guerrilla detachment of a certain army attacked the × at Fumu Pass and Baicha in separate columns. After defeating the ×, we retreated to our positions on the 3rd after completing our mission. The × troops in that area are very afraid of our Jinan team. They have secretly deployed sentries and are scattered in fortifications at night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhanggongdu, 5th] After being destroyed by our guerrilla unit, the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway has been unable to operate for two days. Currently, the × troops are sending teams to provide cover and actively repair the railway. The riverbank from Qiujin west to Guohuashi has also been almost completely destroyed by our artillery fire. The remaining × troops resumed repairs on the 2nd, but they were hit by our artillery fire again, causing heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 6th] On the 6th, our guerrilla unit launched an attack on the De'an-Xiushui Highway from a certain place. Near Daoshanshan, seven kilometers southwest of De'an, they encountered a × artillery regiment heading south for reinforcement. We intercepted them with hand grenades and broadswords. The × troops were suddenly unable to withstand the attack, and their soldiers and horses were in chaos. Our officers and soldiers took advantage of the situation to charge and engage in close combat, killing more than ten × soldiers, eight horses, and capturing two × soldiers: Takahashi Shinichi and Itano Ichiro. One artillery piece was destroyed, and eight rifles and other military flags, diaries, riding boots, amulets, and other items were seized. We only had a few wounded soldiers.</p>

<p>[Foreign News from This Port] It is heard that Wang Jingwei will issue an article tomorrow (today) denying that he is a traitor and intending to explain his reasons for going to Hanoi. Wang will also attack the activities of the Communist Party in China, saying that the greatest danger to China is communism. Communist leader Zhou Enlai is now asking Chairman Jiang to issue a declaration stating that the Three Principles of the People are communism. Furthermore, Wang will accuse the Communist Party, claiming that the Party has drafted a plan to confiscate all private deposits in banks, including foreign banks in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] According to sources close to Wang, whether the above document will be published today is still under consideration.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 5th Special Dispatch] (Delayed) The consulate in Hanoi telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reporting that Wang's subordinates in Hanoi are being ridiculed by public opinion, abandoned by the Chinese people, and are extremely frustrated.

Overseas Chinese communities are particularly indignant.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 6th] According to Chinese official sources, Wang Jingwei plans to convene the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Hong Kong in mid-month, in direct conflict with the Fifth Plenary Session that the Chinese official government in Chongqing plans to convene.

Hong Kong officials have not denied this statement, but a final decision has yet to be made. The newspaper also quoted a Japanese Consul in Hong Kong as saying that the date of successful resumption of shipping between Guangdong and Hong Kong will be after December, and that the Japanese side is actively negotiating with Hong Kong to request permission to resume shipping. He also said that the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong had gone to Guangzhou for four days, and at that time he went from Hong Kong, transferred to, and took a Japanese transport ship to travel. He then traveled from Guangdong back to Hong Kong through Macau. He said that guerrillas were very active in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and sporadic gunfire was frequently heard in the city, making it difficult for the Japanese army to cope.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Birmingham Post stated that Konoe resigned because he was unwilling to take responsibility for the military's plans. His appointment as Minister without Portfolio in the new cabinet is also for this reason. The new cabinet plans to accept any military or naval signature regarding domestic or foreign concessions. If Japan can defeat China, it will become a dictatorship. If Japan fails, a reaction will inevitably arise and it will become a socialist or even a communist country. Therefore, there is no hope for democratic politics in Japan in the future. [Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Germany expressed satisfaction with the personnel of the Japanese cabinet. The appointment of Baron Hiranuma, an experienced politician, and Arida, who created the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact two years ago, was welcomed. They also expect that the policy on the war against China will not be changed. The German Allgemeine Zeitung praised the rapid resolution of this political turmoil and said that the selection of the Japanese Minister of Finance is extremely important, because since the war against China, financial problems have become extremely difficult. Berlin local newspapers stated that the lineup of the Japanese cabinet shows that Japan has not yet compromised politically.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Tokyo report: After holding its first cabinet meeting tonight, Prime Minister Hiranuma issued a statement saying, "The critical juncture Japan is in today is unprecedented in history. It is not easy to overcome the current situation. However, I firmly believe that the government and the people, united under the guidance of the Emperor and expressing their traditional national spirit, can overcome this difficulty. History shows that whenever the country is in a time of crisis, Japan has been able to unite and cope. The country's institutions have also been strengthened as a result. The current situation is the most urgent in history, so the country needs further unity. The general policy of the new cabinet will be announced at an appropriate time. However, at present, all national resources must be concentrated to achieve Japan's 'China' objectives. As for ending the 'China Incident,' the new cabinet will implement the unchanged policies drafted by the previous cabinet and approved by the Emperor."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Foreign news from Tokyo: Yesterday evening, Japan's new Prime Minister Hiranuma Ichiro told reporters that the reason why former Prime Minister Konoe agreed to remain in the new cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio was to show the outside world that the Japanese cabinet would continue to handle everything according to the old cabinet's general policies. The new cabinet will adhere to the policies set by the Imperial Conference without wavering, especially in the matter of adjusting relations with China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Foreign news from Tokyo: Today, the new Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma had a meeting with former Prime Minister Konoe. The two reached a consensus on the previous cabinet's policy on the Sino-Japanese conflict, stating that the two had exchanged opinions. The Japanese media believes that the new cabinet is a mixed cabinet of Hiranuma and Konoe, or a continuation of the Konoe cabinet. Eight of the twelve members of the new cabinet were members of the Konoe cabinet. Two former Vice-Ministers (Ishiwatari Sotaro and Hirose Hisada) were promoted to ministers. Konoe is expected to be appointed Chairman of the Privy Council, but at the same time will attend future cabinet meetings as a Minister without Portfolio.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Chen Yi Inspects Fujian Province: Discusses This Year's Plans <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yanping, 5th] Since the War of Resistance, the authorities in Fujian Province have implemented a policy of strengthening internal facilities in preparation for a prolonged war. In the past year, they have done their best to mobilize manpower and resources and focus on this. Governor of Fujian Chen Yi recently inspected various places on the inner lines at the beginning of the new year. When a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him yesterday, he asked about the results of this policy and inquired about plans to promote the work of various departments this year. According to him, the main work of last year was to recruit soldiers and organize and train the people. Recruiting soldiers is the first priority for supporting the war. Therefore, all sixty-plus counties in the province focused on this point last year. Many of the recruits sent by the counties each month volunteered to enlist and pledged to kill the enemy, and many exceeded the quota, while none failed to meet the quota. This shows the efforts of the propaganda and management personnel, and it is especially gratifying that the people have become more aware. The management personnel immediately punished any abuses they discovered, seeking to eliminate evil and be impartial. Organizing and training the people is the basic work for mobilizing the people to resist the war and implementing a comprehensive war of resistance. In the past year, this has been actively carried out, with the people's education as the center of the work, and the forces of other groups have been gathered. Most of the people in the province, regardless of gender or age, have received new training. This is progressing rapidly in both large cities and remote areas. I personally saw white-haired old men and women in their sixties and seventies and three-foot children gladly joining together to listen to lessons. We hope that this basic work will enable the elderly, the weak, children, and strong men to become strong collective organizations and participate in combat. In terms of developing the national economy, the prerequisite is to complete the internal lines of transportation. At present, the main highways traversing and running vertically through the province have been gradually renovated. This year, it is planned to continue to build three lines, including the line, and implement joint transportation with neighboring provinces to facilitate the transportation of the province's special products and develop inter-provincial trade. We will do our best to develop export trade and implement active trade. In terms of finance, we will abandon the policy of increasing taxes and heavy taxes, and only intend to reorganize the existing taxes. Other measures, such as completing land administration surveys and water conservancy surveys, and then increasing the opening of cultivated land and developing water conservancy and water transportation, will also be carried out simultaneously. Recently, new tasks have also been determined:</p>
<p>(1) Improving the people's livelihood, not focusing on cities and the upper class, but focusing on the universal improvement of the people at the grassroots level, and focusing on improving the lives of the vast number of farmers and workers. The detailed plans will be announced soon.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing research institutes to enable specialized talents in various departments to continue their academic and technical research and increase their knowledge, in line with practical needs.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting national physical education. Seeing that people are physically weak, we should expand national physical education this year. We plan to first set up a physical education class to train new talents and send them to work in various counties.</p>
<p>(4) Establishing a publishing house specifically to compile and print wartime reading materials, with the aim of strengthening the will to resist the war, and focusing on the translation of foreign languages to improve knowledge and cultural standards.</p>
<p>These are all work goals that must be achieved this year. Chen concluded by discussing the war situation, saying, "In recent months, we have encountered the most dangerous storms in the process of the War of Resistance. However, with the great leadership of the leaders and the government and the strong national will to fight, we have now seen the light. This time next year, we will be able to celebrate a great victory and success together."</p>

<h3 id="e72">A Record of the Bloody Battle on the Nanxun Line in April (Part 1) <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Ju</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanchang by Our Newspaper] Since the War of Resistance, the greatest annihilation suffered by the Japanese likely occurred in the battle on the Nanxun Line. This is an indelible contribution of our soldiers, and also a glorious and important page in the history of the War of Resistance. From Jiujiang to De'an, the entire line is only a hundred *li*, but under the combined fierce attack of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, our heroic soldiers were able to hold out for four whole months (from July to October), eliminating over 100,000 Japanese soldiers and capturing countless others. This must be regarded as a great success in annihilation warfare, and we cannot but admire the command and strategy of the officers on the front line. We must never forget the De'an battle, which followed the great victory at Taierzhuang!</p>
<p>Originally, the Japanese ambition was to seize Jiujiang as a base, then launch a large-scale southward offensive, occupy Nanchang, and directly attack Pingxiang and Liling, Jin Hua, thus threatening the political, economic, and cultural centers of the second phase of the War of Resistance in Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, from July 5th, the Japanese began to invade us, but our army resisted at every step in a bloody battle that lasted four months. The Japanese paid a tremendous price, and only managed to occupy a few small cities on the Nanxun Line. Especially after our army withdrew from De'an on October 30th, the Japanese, due to heavy casualties, were clearly unable to attack further. Thus, for the past two months, they have been repairing both the northern and southern banks of the Henan River, and the war has fallen into a stalemate. However, recently our army has completed its deployment and is preparing to launch a large-scale counter-offensive against the Japanese. It is predicted that at the beginning of the new year, when everything is renewed, good news will be frequently reported from the Jiujiang River. This reporter has followed the army for several months, specifically collecting historical materials from this campaign to provide a systematic report to the readers:</p>
<p>The Battle of Jiujiang Enters a Favorable Phase</p>
<p>Jiujiang is located in northern Jiangxi, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and is a strategically vital location. After the Japanese occupied Madang and Hukou one after another in June, they took advantage of the situation to launch a comprehensive offensive against Jiujiang using the combined power of their army, navy, and air force, intending to use it as a base to advance west along the Yangtze River, west along the Jiuling Highway, and south along the Nanxun Railway.</p>
<p>However, while Jiujiang is very important strategically, its terrain and the equipment of our army made it a difficult area to defend. It is a triangular zone, with its northeast sides bordered by the river and lake, allowing the Japanese to land anywhere. Moreover, we had no fortifications, and the blockade line in the river was only a little over ten *li* deep. The entire battlefield was controlled by Japanese naval guns, and the maneuver area was too small, making troop deployment extremely difficult. Therefore, after exacting a considerable price, our army had no choice but to abandon Jiujiang.</p>
<p>The Japanese began their attack on Jiujiang on July 5th, dispatching warships to the northern and southern waterways, the mouth of Poyang Lake, and other places to clear mines and destroy our blockade line. After mid-July, they gradually increased the use of aircraft for reconnaissance and bombing. In fact, the Japanese mine-sweeping was repeatedly repelled by us during the day, and they suffered considerable casualties. It was only because we lacked river defense equipment that they were able to attack at night. On the night of the 23rd, the situation suddenly became tense. A large number of Japanese troops gathered on the west bank of Poyang Lake, using over a hundred motorboats to transport thousands of Japanese soldiers, who forcibly landed at Yin Jia Hu north of Gu Tang. Our troops defending that area immediately launched a fierce counterattack. The battle continued until Japanese aircraft came to cooperate in the operation, and Japanese warships provided covering fire, breaking through our positions. However, that night General Li Hanhun led his troops in a night attack and recaptured the line of Ta Ding Shan and Pu Shan, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. On the 24th and 25th, the Japanese dispersed and infiltrated areas such as Ya Que Shan, Ba Li Po, and south of Liao Jia Ban. At the same time, Japanese aircraft and warships fiercely bombarded Jiujiang city, causing fires to break out in the city, and disrupting order. Japanese motorboats landed at the Yang You Chang and Ma Chang Hu. Due to strategic considerations, our army was ordered that night to retreat to Maling, and built strong defensive lines in Niu Tou Shan, Jin Guan Qiao, Shi Li Shan, and Gu Ling Shan. From then on, our army moved to a new and favorable position.</p>
<p>Repeated Changes in Strategy, the Japanese Still Fail</p>
<p>Maling is characterized by undulating hills and narrow valleys in the north and south. In 1926, General Zhang Fakui led the Iron Army generals, including Miao Peinan, Wu Qiwu, and Li Hanhun, to defeat Sun Chuanfang here. Now, General Li Hanhun has returned, so he is naturally experienced. The main defensive area extends from Niu Tou Shan on the west side of Mount Lu, diagonally southwest, turns northwest through Jin Jia Shan, crosses the Deng Jia River to the west of Shi Li Shan. The terrain is extremely favorable to us. First, away from the rivers and lakes, the Japanese naval artillery loses its effectiveness. Second, destroying the roads prevents the Japanese tanks and heavy artillery from operating. Third, surrounded by large mountains and dense forests, Japanese aircraft cannot find bombing targets. In addition, new fortifications have been built, forming an iron-like defensive line. On this circular position, General Li Hanhun defended for a whole month, eliminating over 20,000 Japanese soldiers and expending over 20 million yuan worth of Japanese ammunition, firearms, and other materials. This is the greatest achievement in offensive and defensive warfare since our War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In early August, the Japanese used the 106th Division, the 90th Division, and part of the 20th Division and 101st Division, totaling about 80,000 troops formed of "Manchukuo" security forces from Anhui, with the commander of the 106th Division, Matsuura, as the commander-in-chief, supported by Japanese air power, to launch a fierce offensive against us. From the 2nd to the 5th, they repeatedly pressed our two flanks. The positions of Wang Da Nao, Niu Tou Shan, and Lao Hu Shan on the right flank, and Xiao Jia Dun, Da Tian Shan, Shi Li Shan, and Ma Tou Shan on the left flank, were repeatedly contested with the Japanese. Statistics show that the Japanese suffered over 2,000 casualties, and we captured a lieutenant and seized a large amount of ammunition worth over 100,000 yuan. The Japanese, angered by the heavy casualties on our two flanks, shamefully fired hundreds of gas shells at our positions on the river islands on the 5th. Our army suffered heavy casualties. After the 6th, they continuously used dense artillery fire as cover, and infantry reapplied the old trick of breaking through the center, advancing towards Jin Guan Qiao; at the same time, they divided their troops and repeatedly attacked the heights of Da Tian Shan and Chen Jia Dun on the left flank. After a fierce battle, the position was lost and regained several times. Our division, led by Chen Gongxia, bravely charged towards the Japanese, completely destroying the Japanese plan to break through the center. However, our regimental commander, Zhang Zeshen, was unfortunately wounded in this battle. By the 26th, Japanese reinforcements had steadily arrived, replenishments were almost complete, and they again used aircraft and artillery to cover their infantry in a fierce offensive against our entire line. The casualties on both sides amounted to several thousand; however, because our left wing was breached by the Japanese, the Japanese were able to advance along the Puzong Highway to Shan, outflanking our army. On September 2nd, their vanguard advanced to He Shang Miao and Huai Shu Yi. At this time, our army was in a position to be surrounded by the Japanese on all sides, so we calmly retreated to the vicinity of De'an.</p>
