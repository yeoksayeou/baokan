<h3 id="c1">中國債信與英美利益 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我國財政部十五日公佈對於償付債務辦法，聲明以關稅担保的債務，不再通融墊付償還，而僅願就戰區外各關稅比例撥付。査我國政府的外債與賠欵，大部都是以關稅爲担保；內債或以鹽稅爲担保，或以統稅爲担保，新發行的內外債則大多以直接稅中的所得稅等爲担保；而統一復興與金長諸債，亦以關稅爲担保。現在我國不再墊付關稅担保外債，則對於英美的利益，似將發生影響；另一方面似乎我國的債信亦發生問題。我們願就純客觀的立場，作一番理智上底分析。</p>
<p>第一，以關稅擔保的財政部經管外債（截止二十八年一月一日止）共有善後借欵，英德續借欵，中英庚欵，沙遜淮河借欵，此四種計英金二四，六一一，三六七磅；及中法庚欵，中比庚欵，此二種計英金二五，五四六，零零零元。可知關稅被日本刦持的結果，損失的是英美而不是我國，尤以英國的損害爲最大。囘憶一九三八年英國駐日大使克萊琪與日本外交次官堀內會商處置上海關稅問題，在五月三日締結關於我國關稅的英日協定中曾規定：凡在日軍軍力控制下各海關稅收概將存在橫濱正金銀行，由此存欵內將應償外債數額撥交總稅務司，履行以關稅爲擔保的外債和賠欵底義務。可是事實上協定簽訂後祇償付善後借欵一百萬元，其他外債概未償付。當時英國旣滿意於此種協定，以致我國雖經抗議而仍無法自田處置稅欵，則今日我國不再墊付關稅擔保之債務，動機雖不包涵抵抗的意義，但在法理上却不能不認爲正當的。</p>
<p>第二，我國政府近年來對於外債信譽的維持，均曾盡最大的努力，如一九三六年十月對於費克斯飛機和馬可尼無線電借欵的整理，一九三七年四月芝加哥銀行借欵和六月太平拓業公司借欵底先後訂定淸償辦法，指定鹽稅作爲擔保。自中日戰爭發生後，戰區海關稅收，全部爲日本刦奪勒存於日方銀行，以致戰區各關應攤而未解的債額，由我國政府轉商中央銀行墊付的積數，達一萬七千五百萬元之多，可見我國政府在戰時尙竭力維持債信。旣在關稅被日本刦持而使我國無法履行償債，則本質上並非我國想賴債，亦卽當然無墊付償還的義務。</p>
<p>第三，我國財部不再通融墊付關稅担保債欵，並不是我國抗戰財政有什麼破綻，　致債信不能維持。其出發點完全是一種自衞的經濟戰爭，避免日本以我國的財源，作侵略的工具：因之對於英美的利益，在一度盡力維持之後，不能再爲維持英美利益而同時資×。所以這是戰時必要的措施，原因不在財政。一九三八年九月我國因日本截留戰區全部鹽稅，而將克利斯浦借欵和英法借欵還本部份暫行緩付，也是同樣的理由。</p>
<p>第四，我國財部雖不准再予通融墊付債欵，但對債信仍舊是竭力維持，以期英美的利益不受損害。在財部聲明中已明白宣稱，以後對海關擔保各項戰前訂借長期債務，按戰區外各海關稅收比例應攤數額，按期撥交中央銀行。設如戰區各關將已存欠繳應攤償賠欵，照舊解交總稅務司時，我國政府仍照舊撥付債欵基金。以恢復戰前原狀。所以英美不維護它在遠東的利益則已，假如眞具維護它在遠東的利益底决心，急應合作制成日本，使得我國的關稅行政獨立和整　自由，間接亦卽是使得本身的利益受到合理的維持和保障。</p>
<p>總之，我國此次對於關稅擔保債務不再墊付，並非抗戰財政艱難而影響到債信的不能維持，完全是日本刦持海關稅收後應有的結果，事實上無可非議的。我們僅希望英美各國爲它本身利益，對於遠東大局能有更精細的分析，更深刻的認識，覺悟到它的債權因日本的侵略而發生危險，不再漠視，以更有効的辨法聯合制裁日本，而以極迅速的行動運行起來。固不僅它的債權——在我國的一切的利益都能得到合理的維護和保障！</p>

<p>— 蔣中正</p>
<p>與改進部他之要務（四）</p>
<p>遵照命令去乍就是走的生路，不奉行命令，表面遵從，實際並不執行，就是走的死路—我們軍人如不服從命令，不切實執行命令，個人寃枉掉了生命事小，害了上官，害了部下。害了友軍，因而害了國家民挨，害了世代子孫罪大—所以我們爲盡到職責，完成任務，保持生命，發揚生命，只有服從命令，澈底執行命令。大家要將這個道理吿訴一般部睛—並要輔佐上官，切實執行命令，以身作則，感化部屬，養成部屬絕對服從命令，澈底執行命令的習慣—這是我們參謀長最大的一個任務。現在各級指揮官發布命令，多是隨便；傳達命令，亦多不負責任；照例主官下命交參謀，參謀交傳令兵，傳令兵送出，就算完事，究竟命令是否按時送達，下達以後，是否執行，執行能否澈底，一槪不管—如此精神不能貫注，許多命令都是沒有貫澈，甚至束之高閣，不知貽誤多少事情，所以今後我們要求命令貫澈到底，切實作到，必須嚴密監督。監督的方法，或不時巡視，或定期考核，以查明所發命令已否忠實執行，執行有無成效？凡屬緊要的命令一，或命令送達重要的地點，必須派員監督實施。必要時我們參謀畏應親自各部隊監督，否則以現在一般部隊的積習，凡是愈難實行的命令，愈懶於執行，豈不命令愈緊要，愈容易誤事，尤其對於游擊戰和別動戰。如命令沒有人監督，你要他游擊，他可以　而不擊，流弊更犬！故發什各　游擊隊和別動隊的重要命令，一定要由司令部派員監督，綫能够促其澈底實行！</p>
<p>第三，要注重傳令與通訊的敎育，並要注意封鎖戰區消息。部隊傳令與通訊敎育，以「迅速」「確實」「秘密」爲原則。因命令傳達與訊息轉遞遞，卽以「迅速」，「確實」，「秘密」爲要件。如果不秘密，則命令和通訊內容容易　漏；不確實，或致誤　，或致遺忘，受令者和收訊人就無所適從，甚至執行錯誤；不迅速，則不能節省時間，甚至貽誤事機。所以部隊命令傳達和通訊聯絡，必須依照這三個原則，實實在在作到，不好有絲毫怠忽延誤的地方。我們要作到這一點，對于傳令官兵和通訊人員就要特別注重技術訓練和精神敎育。技術方面，不但要純熟，而且要精益求精，能實地研究，有所發明；精神方面，不僅在交通便利通訊便捷秩序平靜的地方，一切命令通訊的傳遞，要能够達成迅速確實秘密的要求；就是在交通困難，設備簡陋，戰况緊急，時間迫促，或是敵人火力猛烈，通過困難的時候，亦要能够依照上述三個原則，達成任務！這一點如果不能作到，就會影響軍事，就會打敗仗，大家試一囘想半年抗戰以來，因爲命令傳達遲誤，通訊聯絡不周密，所受的損失是多少。我們過去抗戰失利，原因雖然很多，但過細檢査起來，傳令通訊誤了事機，實在是一個主要的原因。尤其傳送遲緩，不能嚴守時限，誤事最大。要知道：我們打仗，就是爭時問。那一個行動快當，時機佔先，就是那一個勝利，反之就失敗，我們要動作快當，時間節省，就要傳令敏捷，通訊聯絡毫無遲滯，這是關係抗戰成敗最重要的一件事，大家要切實注意作到。至於封鎮消息，就是要使我方一切消息情況不致走漏，內此對於戰區和後力的民衆要有嚴密的組織和訓練，要軍民協力消滅一切漢奸，和×人的間諜，纔排够達到嚴密封鎖的目的！</p>
<p>第四，要硏究武器性能，精練使用技術。現在二般部隊最普遍的一個缺點，就是對於新兵器，不知道他的性能，以至保管不當，使用技術不精，雖有新式利器，亦不能發生大的效力，往往一件兵器，外國軍隊可以用兩三年，到了我們手裏，一用就壞；人家的壞了，自己立刻可以修理，我們官兵大都沒有修理器械　知識和技能，甚至壞了即棄置不顧，根本不設法修理！還有，同一件兵器，人家使用技術嫻熟能够盡其效用、發揮威力，到了我們手裏，因爲使用技術不精，效能就滅少，威力就不能發揚，這個缺點，如不切實改進，抗戰前途，實在危險！今後大家要整理部隊，加强戰鬥力量，必須注重新式武器性能的硏究和使用技術的訓練。無論步槍，輕重機關槍，迫擊砲，或各式大砲，領來之後，首先要由我們參謀長集合各級主管官長精心研究，實地試驗，對於各種兵器的性能，和使甲的方法，一定要完全明瞭，並要規定保管使用的詳細辦法，拿來訓練一般官兵。訓練時，又要實事求是，精益求精，講明白了，還要問答，練習好了，還要熟練，日間練習不足，夜問還要練習，務求技術純熟，使用得法。爲求確實起見，我們主官必須每周每團挑選士兵數人，當面試驗。詳加指導，總要使全軍官兵都能熟識各種新式兵器的性能，都有嫻熟的技術，纔能够發揮新式兵器的效力！</p>
<p>第五，要情報確實，計劃周密。現在各部隊最大的惡習，就是情報不確，計劃不周，文飾戰況，虛報勝仗。而其病根所在，就在於「虛僞」二字。這虛偽兩個字陷在心頭，一切弊病，由此發生！今後我們要改良部隊積習，首先要破除虛僞，事事要求實在，尤其我們職司情報和計劃的參謀人員，要以「實在」爲治理業務的唯一守則。對於×我一切情　無論報吿通吿，必求確實；情報確實，然後計劃纔能周密；計劃周密，戰事纔有把握，譬如我們打了勝仗，究竟進到何處，佔領何地，斬獲多少，損失多少；或是打了敗仗，官兵傷亡幾多，武器損失幾多，×人進到何地，我軍退守何處，以及所以至勝或至敗的原因，都能襲實報吿，不可含糊其詞，也不好有一點誇張或掩飾。我們報吿能够實在，對於自己的力量，纔有忠實的估計，對於部隊谷方面的優點和要點，纔能確實明瞭，然後我們纔能够發揮優點，補救缺陷，量力度勢，戰勝攻取。大家要知道：我們這回與日本開戰，就軍事準備和物質來說，我們都不如人，但是我們憑什　敢與××一戰呢？我們所恃的，就是一個「實」字。就是這個「實在」的精神。我們是憑全民族切切實實的覺悟，集結全國的力量，要打破敵×對我虛僞欺騙侵略壓迫的陰謀毒計。這就是以「實擊虛」，以「正　邪一，亦就是所謂實戰我戰！我們的國勢弱，物質窮，與革命無妨，我們戰緒失利，陣地挫退，亦不要緊。我們知道國勢弱，就有轉弱爲强的辦法，我們知道物質窮，窮有窮的打算，只要我們能實心實力實要求是，勝不張揚，敗不諱飾，察實情，定實計，說實語，作實事，拿實力打實戰，就可以打破一切困難。轉敗爲勝！你們回到部隊，要將本委員長所說的這幾句話吿訴你們主官，今後無論修身治事帶兵打仗，一切皆須講求實在，能够貫澈實在的精神，一定可以獲得最後的勝利！</p>
<p>第六，要注重倉庫糧彈的保障與檢畫。糧秣彈藥爲軍隊侖脈所關，我們時刻要估計前方需要，作充分準備。並要餐飭部屬，妥愼保管，不許隨便散失損壞或浪費。這又是我們參謀長最重要的一個任務。尤其對於　方倉庫，須按時認但檢査，所存槍枝彈藥粮秣，概須精確統計，以爲考査根據。</p>
<p>第七，要注意保存舊服。現在戰時，國家經濟非常艱難，部隊軍服，平時可以按李節製發，以新換舊。將來恐因材料缺之，能否按時換發，尙未可知。所以今後官兵換下之棉制服棉大衣，以及軍帽，綁麗等，必須注意保存，並要轉吿一般官兵，以後每套軍服，戰時至少要用兩年，此次換下之棉衣服裝。卽須留存今冬服用。到了冬天，不再　發！</p>
<p>第八，要愛護騾馬。騎兵的馬匹，和運輸的鄧馬，都是作戰最需要的工具，我們必須特別愛護。無論行軍紥營，都要照顧周到。每天要按時洗馬制馬，按時喂糧飲水。尤其是長途行軍，馱載不可過重，飲水要按時供給，行軍歇營時，又要督促兵夫妥爲洗刷；必俟騾馬洗刷完畢，然後方准兵夫休息。現在各部隊兵夫對於騾馬，毫不愛惜，或任具饑渴而死，或馱載過重　斃，種種忽略大意，殘害運輸工具，就是叻害軍隊運輸。我們官長今後一定要以「克勤小物」，「愛屋及烏」的精神，督飭部屬加以改進。</p>
<p>以上所說關於部隊應改進的事項，都是根據實際情形。綜合各方報吿所得的意見，大家聽明白以後，就要帶回部隊，切實依照改良。其餘部隊應改進的事項我在抗戰檢討與必勝要訣講演集中，已講得很多。大家要一倂拿來研究實行。還有軍事委員會歷次所頒發的關係戰術戰略和改進部隊的訓令命令等，大家要逐件檢出，從頭至尾，研究一次。考査一次。此外我　將各地官長各外籍顧問所呈作戰經驗和意見，彙編起來，印成小册，今天已分發各位，大家亦須特別研究，裨益參謀業務與作戰前途，必非淺鮮！</p>
<p>總之，×人的情况，現在已陷於進退維谷，今後他如要冉向前進，兵力愈分散困難愈多，我們愈易消滅他，而且我們看他的軍紀風紀，壞到如此不可收拾的腳步，姦淫慘殺，焚燒刦掠，無所不爲，已經喪盡人性！他還說要憑了優越的武器，一兵一槍，橫衝直撞，就可以消滅我們眞是藐視我們到了極點　驕橫到無以優加了！如此　淫貪殘，精神沒有不墮落，意志沒有不薄弱，他們的軍隊之腐敗無力，由此可　想見！無論他有怎樣好的武器，都不相干！今後我們一定要拿×人這種騙橫腐敗的情形，吿訴一般官兵，要提起我們攻擊精神，以我們革命軍擋此禽獸之兵，腐敗之×，還不能推敗他，殲滅他嗎？我們抗戰以來，首都淪陷，總理陵墓亦不保，而北平，天津、上海，南京，杭州，濟南，太原……等被陷區域的同胞，天天在受×人的×慘懷殺，過非人的生活，我們的車人，實在愧對良心！尤其是身爲統帥，使國家蒙此大辱，同胞遭此浩刦，有無可推諉的罪過，古人說：「國家興亡，匹夫有責」。何况我們作了軍人，我們一定要刻骨銘心，臥薪嘗胆，爲國家雪恥，爲已死將士和同胞復仇！我相信各位必有此同感！希望大家將此意　吿一般官兵，人人要知道　們不殺死×人，不打倒×人，不僅被陷落區域的同胞，要受×人的××慘殺，將來全國的人民，連我們自己的父母兄弟姊妹姑嫂，妻兒子女，親戚朋友，都要受×人的奴辱殺戮，到那一個地方，都沒有我們立足之地，葬身之所，我們現在不捨命疆塲，爲國效死，將來就祗有飲恨終身，再沒有報國的機會，我們無論爲公爲私，爲國家爲個人，都就抱定「有×無我，有我無×一的决心，知恥　發，抵死排戰，以爭取我們國家的獨立，和民族的生存！　（完）</p>
<p>來函　請敎張君勱先生　林北麗</p>
<p>君勵老伯左右：西來後，久思詣謁，以人事牽率，數數未果。昨於報端，獲覩人作「致毛澤東先生一封公開的信』，驟讀之，語長心重，誠哉仁者之言藹如也；顧　學如北麗者，再四維誦，轉多未解，竊疑長者所云云，不惟不足以感召毛先生，將使熱心抗戰與團結者，不因毛先生之報吿書而弱其信念，而反因長者之一書，起猜疑與摩擦之漸，甚且變本加厲焉，其影響且猶不止如長者所云：「精力消耗於猜疑與摩擦中」已也。果爾，則長者或亦自悔其立言之輕率，然而晚矣！</p>
<p>長者此書，列舉三點，一言以蔽之，似皆爲擁護中央而鞏固其威信者，獨惜所言多乖於事實，非僅理論之未盡善，且由於事實之失眞，設不幸而不善讀長者之書者，誤以此而懷疑於抗戰軍事與政治之不統一。不合理，則中央之威信轉以墜，黨派之分裂轉以深，諺有云「天下本無事，庸人自擾之」，又豈長者下筆時之本意哉！</p>
<p>長者謂：『軍隊應屬於國家，不可使軍隊與特殊主義發生聯繫，』此之謬也。世界上任保國家，必有所以　國，立國之道，主義而已。故軍隊在一方面固可爲國家之工具，而另一方面，必其能爲此一國家所以立國之主義而奮鬥，其車隊始有價値，其軍人之流血，乃不爲無意識之犧牲：若但標榜曰「軍隊應屬於國家，」則令之滿洲國固亦自號爲國家，且已取得長奢所宗拜之德意志國家之承認，吾人亦將率軍隊屬之乎？不特此也，今之華中華北僞組織，亦自稱代表中華國家，吾人亦將率軍隊屬之乎？不問所以立國之主義，而僅問其屬於國家與否，勢必至神聖衛國之軍隊，凡竊國之異族，叛國之賊子，皆得　藉其威力而負之以趨，此其危險爲何若！長者亦曾一思之否耶？抑主義之爲物，無所謂特殊，特殊云正確云者，特自其客觀與主觀之對立而言耳。矧今日中華民國以三民主義立國，天下皆知，長者必欲中華民國之軍隊，不屬於三民主義而屬於空洞無邊際之國家，知者或　長者之忽於擇辭，苛有從而情者　且溪長者之，近於為日滿與僞組織宣傳，而反對舉國一致服情之三民主義與中　民國，是雖加長者以　感軍隊之名，亦無不可，不知長者又何以自解也？「共產主義是民生主義的理想，民生主義是共產主義的實行，」國父孫中山　生嘗三數剴切爲國民黨同志道之，長者猶有所曉嘵，「見駱駝而駭爲馬腫背」，得毋類是？北麗至此，益嘆長者眞不愧爲自所舖張排比之國社黨領袖；宜不知三民主義並不知共產主義爲何物也。</p>
<p>長者又謂邊區政府形同割據，此更遠於事實。原邊區政府之由來。抗戰後北方民衆與軍事互維絮之形勢，實使之然，此在淪陷區域之人士，莫不皆知，且莫不皆題其體制，故此為戰時之產物，而非永久不變更之組織，至今中央予以事實上之事認，亦知其有利於抗戰也，况政府之上，冠以邊區二字，同時又受中央之協助，卽在名義一方面，亦已與中央政府之有省政府，市政府，縣政府相同，若如長者言，豈亦將達舉中華民國之省政府，市政府，縣政府而廢止之乎？有為知其不可也。是則長者之所指割據，又爲「無的放矢』矣。</p>
<p>最後長者致疑於共產黨之努力於民族鬬爭爲放棄階級關爭，遂有『不如將馬克思主教暫擱一邊』之說。斯又可發人一噱者也。夫以一階級之政黨，含有國際性之政黨，而與數階級之政黨，平流共進，以從事於一國對外之關爭，此自有其無上之意義，意義唯何？蓋今日抗戰，表面上雖僅爲一國對外之鬬爭，而實際則此國爭並非一國家一民族對於其他國家與民族之　爭，乃爲一民族在其自身與國家解放之基礎上，負有爲全世界民族之和平而鬬爭之義務，更發揮此劃時代之使命者也，此一偉大使命之完成，最受壓迫之世界無產階級，當然解放，忠於馬克思主義，列寧主義者，正宜摩頂放踵以求其實現，此其一：次則『暫擱一邊』云云，在政客官僚輩固優為之，忠於某一主義或對於某一學說眞有信仰者，必不忍出此，且以今日之中國共產黨爲之，不惟對於共產主義爲不忠，對於國民黨爲不信，長者屬望共產黨而以政客官僚之不忠不信督促之，邦人君子將視長者爲何如人乎？此其二；至於長者此書意或有託，辭非盡平，此則今日稍明政情者能詳，非一女子所敢知也。徒因先君在日與長者相契，而家思與庚白亦數稱長者之好學，輒忘　固陋，妄有所就質，願長者更一熟思之，則抗戰幸甚！</p>

<h3 id="c3">晋冀察邊區　接今日第三版 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>二、連串的新的經騐與教訓</p>
<p>在這次×人大舉圍攻晉　察邊區及晋冀察全體軍政民粉碎×人大舉圍攻的鬥爭中，我們確備得了不少的新的經驗與敎訓。茲縷述如下：</p>
<p>乂人方面</p>
<p>×人此次圍攻邊區、因爲邊區的鞏固和擴大，武裝力量的堅靱、和過去多次進攻的一再失敗，所以在戰略戰術上，都較前益爲週密，有計劃，愼重和持久。其主要的表現，是有下列諸點：</p>
<p>（一）「政治資本」與「懷柔政策」</p>
<p>第一、是當此次×人圍攻邊區之前、事先先進行了充分的　備工作、它不但在各個進攻出發綫上首先結集了自己的兵力、進行圍攻的動員、堅定士氣、幷驅使漢奸匪徒搗亂邊區、作進攻邊區的先鋒、並且在民間製造許多謠言、欺騙民衆、用飛機散發各種傳單、宣傳所謂「新民道德」、對我抗×政肘和各抗×黨派、作瘋狗狂吠似的謾駡與汚　，企圖在民間造成進攻邊區的「政治資本」、挑撥邊區黨派軍民的團結、同時或須是因爲×人已經感到全憑武力的進攻、慘酷燒殺、鎭壓、搶奪、毒攻等政策、是不能征服中國人民抗×的會識的了、所以在這次圍攻劉同時又採用了「懷預柔政策」、進行「宣撫」農民的工作、一所以這次×人圍攻邊區政治上的陰謀、破　較　過去幾次的圍攻、都來得利害。</p>
<p>（二）週密而愼重的戰鬥部署第二、是調集精銳兵力五萬餘人、幷加强其技術兵器、組成多數支隊、每支隊以二千人至七千人不等、以平漢、平綏、正太、同蒲四條鐵路線爲出發　、採取「分進台樂」的部署、同時向邊區中心作大包圍之進擊、但又因爲怕我軍予以各個擊破、各支隊在兵方編制上多以各兵種混合編成、具備獨立戰的能力、並且各支隊間密切連系、保持相互策　和愼重的行動、不復像過去目的孤軍深人了、</p>
<p>（三）「步步躍進」與強大的縱深配備</p>
<p>第三、當×人各冊支隊向邊區進擊時、一般的採取『步步推進』的方式、由一個据點向別一個据點躍進時、如發現我軍、每日只前進十里八里、每到達一地、特別是在交通要　進擊的部隊、首先構築括　、修復城墻、掃蕩附近的抗日力量、作有陣地之退進、以防我軍之襲擊、例如由大同陽原蔚縣前進之×、曾在桑乾河流域作了多時的掃蕩工作、進入曲陽大營、繁峙之×、亦卽停止築工、同時×人又爲防我突破其一部、防止游擊隊威脅　側後與破壞後方連絡綫、其路進攻部隊、又多採用强大的縱深配備</p>
<p>（四）連絡調動迅速和不斷的供給</p>
<p>第四、×人各個支隊，仍多沿交通路線，向邊區進擊，並努力修築各要線的汽車路，以保其後方連絡的願暢。連絡調動迅速和不斷供給，這差不多成了×人這次進攻中的重要部份。×國議員尾崎曾說：「戰勝中國，最主要條件，是後方不被切斷」。×人知道：邊區民衆已有緊張的戰鬥動員、和澈底的淸野空室工作、要想槍奪民間財物來供給部隊的給養、是不可能啊，特別得對於技衛兵噐的必需供給品的供給、更無由得到、所以這次每到達一據點、即貫通各據點的汽車路、並貯積給養彈藥、以保持久、如若遇到山地阻隔、一時不易修通汽路　、即改爲大批携帶、由孟縣攻五台之×、曾帶騾馬子餘頭、或利用飛機輸送、但是這些方法、終究仍屬有限的事、</p>
<p>（五）分割邊區企圖分區「掃蕩」</p>
<p>第五、×人知道邊區領土廣大、並擁有五台、恒山兩大山脈的險要地勢、邊區武牧部隊、具有豐富的游擊戰、與運動戰鬥經驗、和强大的戰鬥力、企圖一舉「殲滅」邊區軍隊所有主力戰、是不可能的。因而　圖以强大兵力沿着主要交通綫深人邊區、把整個邊區分割爲多數小塊、以圖縮小我軍　旋地、使我行　不變、廻旋不靈、分散我們的兵力、滅弱我軍的機動力量、然後進而作分區「掃蕩」、以達成殲滅我有生力量或使我軍轉移地區之目的。但　目的也　爲×人不斷遭我軍打擊、這一毒計、便始終毫無成就。</p>
<p>（六）集結行動梯形前進與毒攻</p>
<p>第六、×人雖然知道我軍裝備與火力、都較其簿弱、但深懼我軍的突然襲擊的作戰、所以×人各個支隊、多取愼重集結的行動、週密戒備、到處亂放槍炮、實行威力搜索、以一部兵力展開前進、其餘主力、則採梯階隊形、當發現我軍　、以强大密集的火力、向我壓迫、頑强抵抗、或突破一點、臨危時、輒用毒攻、並以多數飛機掩護、向我軍陣地施行轟炸、投擲毒彈、如發現我軍主力在　一方、或被其吸引時、其他方面的支隊、也能靈活地作迅速的躍進、</p>
<p>（七）欺騙鎭壓雙管齊下</p>
<p>第七，隨着軍事進攻的進展，×人政治上的進攻、亦卽大肆活躍，而採取「懷柔政策」，收買欺騙，挑撥造謠，宣傳「東洋道德」「新民道德」，破壞我民族團結，召一方面則積極「摧毀」一切抗日組織，鎭壓民衆的抗×情緒，特別是鎭壓民衆中的抗×積極份子和號召民衆回家，企圖組織維持會與僞車。</p>
<p>（八）燒殺搶奪投毒兼施並行</p>
<p>第八，大肆燒殺，毒攻，以圖在經濟上作大規模的破壞，不但民間糧食，農具和房屋多被燒毀，牲畜亦多被殺死與搶奪，而且採取毒辣手段破壞金融，施放毒藥，注射毒針，用飛機到處轟炸造成恐怖局面及投彈毒炸，當×人　却時則沿途　內却被投施毒藥，因而我軍民中毒者，爲數不少，這種手段，可謂極盡殘暴慘酷卑鄙之能事。</p>
<p>我們方面</p>
<p>兇惡的×人，依憑其精　龐大的兵力，週密的計劃，毒辣的手段，陸軍空軍的配合，其勢汹汹的向晉冀察邊區大舉圍攻，這對于尙屬靑年的習冀察邊區確是一種嚴重的情况，然而邊區人民政權與軍隊，在堅定的領導，緊密團結之下。并不因此而稍有恐懼，相反的，他們都是在×人包圍火力之下，在×人不斷的圍攻中生長與鞏固擴大起來，並具有豐富的反×人圍攻的經驗。對×人的這樣圍攻，原是他們早就預想着的必然的現象，他們都有戰勝×人圍攻的堅實的决心，和堅持作戰取得最後的勝利的信心，這次經兩月來反圍攻的苦戰。又一次的粉碎了×人圍攻的計劃，獲得了光榮的模範的勝利及許多寶貴的經驗與敎訓（未完）</p>

<p>從軍事觀點上說來、邊區所處的地位、在戰略上、但有重大的意義、它介于平漢、正太、平綏、同蒲四條鐵路之間、有着恆山山脈和五台山脈的險要地勢、句括七、多州縣、千萬以上的人口、它的存在和發展、給予了×人以重大的威脅和危害、對×人向南或向西北的進攻、增加了很大的困難、因此邊區恰像在×人　頭的一根　、同時在它的發展和模範　響之下、冀中、冀東、熱南、察東等地都廣泛的開展了游擊戰爭、並逐漸開展着建立抗日根據地的工作、這給×人的威脅、當然更加擴大了、逼使、人只能困守鐵路綫和幾個城鎭、就是鐵路線也不斷被我破壞、往返部隊遭我襲擊、如在×人　後方的張垣、平津以及山海關一帶、也不斷被我　人戰爭狀態、使日本軍閥寢饋不安、漢奸　驚慌失措、難怪河北偽省長高凌蔚、要設出「無省可治」的哀鳴、×軍公報也以五台與武漢相提並重、謂爲「南北呼應以抗日」的。</p>
<p>同時邊區的存在和發展、還發生了三種重大的作用：</p>
<p>第一、是雜繫在了民心、我們要知道×人企圖征服中國、不僅要强佔我們的國土、消滅我們的軍隊、而且要征服我們的人心、可是由於邊區的存在和發展、一年來戰區附近乃至整個華北廣大同胞的心、不但未爲日×所征服、而且相反的、平津附近廣大的同胞的抗日情緒愈益提高、反日除奸的運動日益普遍、他們都希望和相信着、我們的游擊隊遲早是會打來、把日本鬼子趕走的。</p>
<p>第二、由於邊區的存在和發展、游擊戰爭的廣泛的展開、使×人掠奪華北經濟來源的目的、無由達到。</p>
<p>第三、由於邊區的存在和發展、游擊戰爭的開展、使×人不容易建立僞組織和僞軍、相反的已經組織起來的僞組織和僞軍、也不斷的被我摧毀和瓦解着。</p>
<p>芷因爲邊區的存在和發展、在軍事政治經濟各方面都具有重大的意義和作用、給予了×人以最人的威脅和危害、所以×人就三番五次的發動向邊區進攻、企圖摧毀這模範抗×根据地、除去他喉頭裏的這根　骨。</p>

<p>【重慶通訊】社交會堂——又是一次火熱的盛會呵！第一次不能使人忘懷的『爲革命鬥爭歌唱』的吼聲，重復地在耳鼓裏激盪起來了。</p>
<p>蔣夫人今天在這裏演講「抗戰肆國中的婦女問題」，三點鐘就開始。</p>
<p>兩點三刻較場口的女同胞擠滿了，汽車人力車無法通過，純樸的靑年，學生大羣地，如果說電，院方散塲。情景决不是如此旣極熱閙，又極莊嚴。</p>
<p>童子軍在服務，把一個個的靑年學生婦女界的人　以及中外記者來賓引到樓上大廳內坐下，忙碌的在集中，不上半點鐘就緒了。三點鐘，蔣夫人御元色大衣，精神奕奕地，翩然地來到會塲，她一面慈祥地含笑與大家爲禮，一面在台上座椅中坐了下來。</p>
<p>會塲四十六個團體二千多位女同胞，聚精會神地爲蔣天人的豐采所權住而緊張起來，沒有喧嘩也沒有聲息，靜悄悄地又莊嚴又沉肅，無數的精靈凝集起來了。</p>
<p>主席台上有沈慧蓮張藹眞劉　靜等陪著蔣夫人坐在一邊。司儀迅捷地宣佈了開會，唱黨歌，行禮，讀總理遺囑，爲死難將士同胞默哀，隨後卽由新運婦女指委會總幹事張藹眞至席致詞，繼田該會生活指導組長黃佩蘭報吿該會工作槪况，她把新運婦女指委會成立經過組織槪况和工作情形等說得非常詳盡。黃女士報吿完了以後，蔣夫人在熱烈的掌聲中，開始講演。</p>
<p>蔣夫人精神健旺極了。她一站到臺前面來，任何人精神都緊張起來，因爲她們都　幸地親聆了領袖的訓話。蔣夫人很慊抑地首先聲明一二二五宣傳旬婦女日江巴各界　旗的那一天，因爲身體不舒服沒有到會，但也不完全是身體的關係，她說「我覺得十分慚愧，因爲我對國家沒有什麽貢献，不配受諸位的献旗，所以沒有出席』。隨着她把指導委員會的大槪說明了一點，她說在「重慶本會的工作人昌有二三十人，但她們决不是怕死才躱到後方來的，也不是爲逃難才來的，原因是後方！作比前方更重要。在後方要發動組織培養新的工作幹部，不能不要有人去做的，指委會工作同志在　方的現有一百多人，她們歷盡艱險地在奮鬥着，她們在前綫爲傷兵難民而服務』。</p>
<p>『後方的工作，在四川已經是一個中心，現在應該立刻發動起來，組織起來！』</p>
<p>『我們這裏有二千多個女同胞，大家都參加抗戰工作，這是不够的，我們還要說服親近的人一致參加，在今後一個星期之中。每個人要說服上個人，那末我們便有二萬個人做抗戰！作，這兩萬冉每個人去說服十個人；這樣努力下來，全國婦女總動員，就立刻實現了」蔣夫人說到這裏把羣衆提醒了一下，他說「你們不要以爲與國家沒有汁麽關係。你們都是智識份子、受國家的　遇，比一般的人要優厚得多，你們讀書，就是受國家的修養，就是受老百姓的優厚待遇，老百姓他們的血，膏，油，都供給了你們。你們應該償還。替國家做工作，就是替老百姓做工作，就是增加生產。增加國富，增强抗戰力量，就是　國家民族的解放。」</p>
<p>蔣夫人還把許多驚心動魄的事吿訴大家。</p>
<p>「今天報紙上有一條消息，說，人在佔領區內强徵妓女，諸君想想，這些妓女是什麽人，就是你們的母親，姊妹。也是我的母親，姊妹，我們受這樣的侮辱能忍耐嗎？」「×人的毒謀不但是要吞併我們的土地搜刮我們的金錢，同時還要我們的同胞做奴隸。」蔣夫人憤慨得把話激昂地喊着：「你們願意不願意做奴隸？」兩千人的四千只怒眼要冒火了。大家叫着：「不願意」！</p>
<p>「在上海作戰時，我們曾聽得報吿，說×人把我們的　同胞抓去，剝掉了衣裳，在肩上刺了號碼，一面讓我們的女同胞羞恥，不能逃跑，一面又充他們的××，這是在北火車站發現的事情．還有我們的壯丁，被他們拉去，强迫掘墳墓，掘好了墳墓，就用機關槍掃射死自己埋自己，如果沒有打死的，就用刺刀刺，腿踢要活埋我們的壯丁。」</p>
<p>「在南昌的時候，看見成千成萬的婦女兒童，爲了逃難在路上受盡辛苦，我覺得非常難過，這些同胞的苦難爲誰吃的呢？那也是我們的×人害的。」「不渦在前方我所接觸的將領，士兵，和同胞，他們雖很苦，他們却能認識×人，他們都一致地要抗戰到底。」</p>
<p>蔣夫人還列舉了戰地兒童被×人吸血的慘劇，農民被×人烹煮的事實等，大家聽了，一個個都已是怒髮冲冠的了，這時蔣夭人再說到了我們要免除爲奴隸，要爭取自由獨立，唯有堅决抗戰，唯有抗戰到底。</p>
<p>「在武漢辦婦女戰地服務幹訓班的時候，與學生共同生活，一樣擦地　，抹桌子，揩玻璃窗，並不是要人家做老媽子，做一個好家庭太太，而是要訓練她們刻苦耐勞的精神，可以到前方去爲國家効力。現在×人這樣殘暴，那末我就應該抗戰，抗戰一定可以得到最後勝利的。」這時蔣夫人提出了許多牧們抗戰必勝的條件。</p>
<p>「李宗仁老太太，已經七十六歲了，有一次我去看她，對李將軍在前方作戰表示慰勞，但她却止色地回答我說；這是軍人的大職，應該爲國効力，她還笑着說中國有二萬萬女同胞，如都能參加抗戰，就算用　刀也可把×人殺退的」，蔣夫人又指出婦女戰地服務的十六個學生，在衡山被×機狂炸後死了三個人，傷了兩個，其中受重傷的一個，最近已寫信來要我分派工作，她手臂口斷了，她說她可以做富傳工作。「在戰地更有許多英勇婦女，帮助軍隊，鼓勵軍隊，台兒吒戰役中，就有很多婦女鼓勵將士，很收到偉大的效果。」接着堅决的說，一這種精神，是中華民族的精砷，這種英勇的事情是中華民國的代表，我們做中國人的都應該覺得榮串，都應該奮起！」</p>
<p>「不但是如此，我們民族的恢復力也很强，×人極力破壞，但一到×人去了，我們的秩　很快就恢復過來，因此，我們抗戰確是十分光明」。這時蔣夫人又引用西哲的一句名言：「危險時創這大偉人，安樂時創造妖怪」來鼓勵大家，他說一要國家復興，是必須經過很苦的過程的。」「祗有恢復自信，勇敢前進，抗戰就會勝利了。現在婦女界尤其應該團結起來，組織起來；現在我國婦女爲國服務的可能性還沒有發揮出來，如果完全發揮出來，比男子還要强得多。我們團結起來是爲政府，爲整個國家，我們要在國家的大前提之下，集中力量！」「現在衹要大家抽出一部份的時間來參加抗戰工作，去做救老百姓，救國家的工作，我們要集中力量來思想怎樣增强抗戰力量的問題，不論誰都有他的力，都可以救國！」</p>
<p>蔣夫人愈講愈昂奮起來，羣衆的掌聲也愈鼓愈響，最後他提出了今天參加婦女動員工作的實際辦法，並且獲得熱烈歡呼而結束了她的演講！</p>
<p>偉大的熱烈的盛會結束了，但大　的抗戰婦女的活動却從此開始了，瞧看吧，重慶的婦女，已在蔣夫人你導下怒吼了！</p>

<p>本報昆明廿二日專電、滇將全省耕地稅慨行撥作各縣行政事業費。當此滇省行政困難之際，能遵照總理建國大網規定，率先將耕地稅　爲地方健全行政機構努力生產建設，誠可為後方各省賢明當局的模範。當此抗戰建國成敗轉捩時期，凡我地方當局，除凜遵中央國策施行政務以外，其有適應地方特殊條件而』抗戰建國所必需者，祗須符合抗戰建國綱領，均應盡力以赴。滇省此舉、僅爲一例而已。唯善政之推行，猶須注意兩點：一爲施行善政之人，務須確具爲抗戰建國而奮鬥之熱誠，仁民　物之心情，淸廉淡泊之德性，及充分之經驗與學識，而黨派成見務名舍實，尤爲用之之大忘。一爲施行善政之環境，務須於消極方　　　　　　　　及守舊腐化之勢力，於積極方面鼓勵黨政軍民親密合作，尤以民治之推政，則不僅爲抗戰之利，抑可爲建國成功之始基也。</p>
<h3 id="c27">論華南戰局 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>粤省戰事連日轉趨激烈，大戰不日展開。舉其主要原因：一方面是×軍急欲「毀滅」我抗戰建國的主要根據與實力，乘此盟友德意兩國加緊騷擾西方，英法續示讓步之　，大舉增援華南，準備大規模的西南攻略戰；另　方面是我方自西南行營成立後對於二期杭戰一切部署大致完成，生力軍步步推進，積極準備反攻。</p>
<p>根據我×現勢及我軍政當局報吿，我們對於華南戰局前途，實表無限興奮與期待。不過現在還有兩個妨礙戰局順利進展的問題急待解决，第一是『政治重於軍事，民衆重於兵士』的綱領沒有切實執行，今後首須實現政治機構與民運機構的改善，黨政軍民關係調整，靑年運動農民運動的統一等等。第二在若干地方發現了土匪游擊隊的混淆，騷擾鄕里，實際上做了×軍的刖動隊，而許多正規的游擊隊和熱血靑年與僑胞的下鄕欽亡運動，則橫遭阻礙慘遇殺害。因此游擊隊的統一指　與普遍發展，實爲當前急迫的要求。不過這里應該　意到（一）澈底撤去包辦民運的藩籬，發揮民衆援助抗戰的積極性；（二）重用具有動員民衆經騐的人才，認眞培植前進的堅强的靑年幹部。</p>
<p>一年來南洋各地抵制日貨的效果　作者Eleanor　Dennison　保仁譯目十二月份紐約Far　Eastern　Suivey</p>
<p>中國自發動了神聖的英勇抗戰以後，一般僑居在南洋各　的中國人民對抵制日貨一項，已收到驚人的效果，我們檢討以往的歷史，中國每當受××侵略壓迫的時候，這般僑居南洋的華人，總是用抵制日貨的消極辦法，去愛護他們的國家，使侵略國在經濟上受到損失，這種民族精神的表現，誰還敢說中國人是落後不先進的民族？</p>
<p>在英屬馬來半島，荷屬東印度，菲律濱越南及暹羅等處，總計居有七百萬中國僑民，大部分工商企業，多操縱在中國僑商手裏，雖然他們在當地政治上，文化上沒有多大勢力，但對祖國是非常關懷，每每在經濟上，物質上，給與祖國極大的帮助。</p>
<p>我們知道，南洋各地是日貨出口的唯一重要售銷市場。一九三七年日本運往南洋的貨物，占國家總輸出的百分之十二，在中日戰事未發生以前，南洋各地因爲和日本鄰近，運輸極爲捷便，因而成本較少，故大多僑商，多願銷售日本商品，就是二般僑民，因日貨售價低　，也樂爲購買，無形中做日本貨物的推銷者，日貨之所以能在南洋各地暢銷，也未嘗不是這個原因，因爲有以上種種持殊情形，所以中國僑民要是對日經濟抵抗，不容說是件易如反掌的事。</p>
<p>自一九三七年七月，中日事變發生後，南洋谷地的人民，鑒到日本軍閥在中國的侵略行爲及戰區內塞草埋魂，荒邱委骨的慘狀，多深惡侵略者的×行，同時中國在南洋所辦的報紙，又在盡量揭發日軍侵略的野蠻行動，因此激動了多數當地居民及華僑的同情，多見義勇爲，自動起來組織團體，對日經　抵抗，故抵制日貨運動，風起雲湧，遍及各地。就是英法等在南洋所辦的報　上，也大事鼓吹制日。</p>
<p>因爲外邦人士偉大的同情，和中國僑民努力策動的結果，抵制日貨運動，已得到成效。一九三八年一月至九月間，日本對外總輸出，較一九三七年同時期減少百分之四十，對南洋各地的輪出滅少百分之五十四日本運往荷屬東印度的貨物，較一九三七年减低百分之五十八，運往英屬海峽殖民地的，减少百分之七十五，運往菲律濱的减少百分之四十一，暹羅减少百分之十六，越南减少百分之四十，英屬馬來半島减少百分之五十九，唯婆羅洲却較一九三七年反增加百分之六。以上各地中，前四個地方——荷屬東印度，英屬海峽殖民地，菲律濱及暹羅——是日本輸出品的重要銷售市場其餘較次要。</p>
<p>日本輸入南洋各地的貨物，旣然受抵制運動的影響而形减少。但决不致牽連到南洋各地的對外貿易，他們對外的輸入額，反比以前增加不過也有幾個地方，因爲當地抵貨運動太熱烈的緣故，對外總輸入也有减少的現像。例如英屬馬來半島（包括海峽殖民地）在一九三八年　月至七月間，他的總輸入，較一九三七年同時期减少百分之十六，而從日本輸入的貨物，竟减少百分之七十四，在菲律濱他的總輸入額增加百分之三十六，而從日本輸入菲律濱的貨物，减少之數量占總輸入的二成英屬馬來人民對抵制日貨運動，非常熱心，此種工作，近來更積極，各商店多不販賣日貨，就是從前積存在店裏的日本底貨，也不出售，如日本的棉織物，電噐材料，汽車，機械零件及罐頭食物等，近已不多見，尤其是日本製造的橡皮眙及橡皮管，在市面上已將絕跡。</p>
<p>不過有一點我在此得附帶說明，日本這年對南洋各地輸出品的减少，固然是抵制日貨運動的力量，但其中另一部份原因，還是日本國內限制工業原料輸入，及日本出口貨物價格增高所致。據統計，日本今年運往南洋各國的物貨價額，較一九三七年平均每月减少二千萬日元。</p>
<p>日本貨物旣被南洋各國排棄，自然就要引起其他歐洲列强的競爭，例如英屬馬來半島，一九三八年由日本運入的貨物，較去年减落百分之七十四，而由歐洲各國運入的貨物，却增加百分之十九。在中日戰事以前，美國與南洋的商業貿易，素不發達，但在去年，因抵制日貨關係，美國反而在貿易上獲得很大利益。新近荷屬東印度居民所乘的汽車，大部多爲美國出品，日本和德國所製造的汽車，多被人民排棄不用，在英屬馬來半島，中國僑民及當地居民，率願吃美國出產的沙汀魚，而不吃日本貨，雖然美國沙汀魚比日本的要貴二倍以上，亦在所不惜。</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>錢新之先生勗勉：戒賭，戒嫖，戒早婚</p>
<p>談釗「銀行界」，似乎就要聯想到他們的生活是「居尊處優」。要是聽到這「貴族」的一羣亦組織起來，嚴肅起來，好　會敎我們驚訝，詫異，而繼之以歡欣，快慰。</p>
<p>其實，在時代怒潮激　之下，除非是麻木不仁，甘願落伍的，那一個不是從昏迷之中驚覺起來呢？香港銀行界，就是進步的洪流中的一枝支流；是用不着我們多所「驚訝」與一詫異」的。</p>
<p>們的名稱叫做香港銀行業業餘聯誼會，是籌備了二個多月辦　了立案手續，於昨天下午一時半在孔聖堂舉行成立典禮的。他　的動向，是與二十二天前成立的　港業餘聯誼社，同樣地是改善業餘生活，提倡正當妙樂，增進服務效能的一種饒有意趣的組織。不過　前者是綜合各行的職業界，後者純粹是銀行界吧了。</p>
<p>該會計有三種會員，永久會員有二十三人，贊助會員有二二七人，普通會員有四八一人，總共是七百三十一人。永久會員一次繳納港幣五十元以上，贊助會員每月繳納一元以上十元以下，普通會員每月繳納三角，此外，另有募捐基金，經濟上的基礎是相當充實的。該會會員所屬的銀行與銀行所屬機關如：中央銀行，中央信託局，中央儲蓄會，中國銀行，交通銀行，金城銀行，農業銀行，國貨銀行，廣東銀行，廣西銀行，郵政匯業儲金局，汕頭商業銀行等共四十六個金融機關。組織方面在常務理事會之下設有總務，會員，學術，服務，體育，娛樂等部，分担會務的　行。他們的名理事是錢新之，李道南，杜月笙，霍寶材諸　生。</p>
<p>昨天開會時，賓主很夠熱鬧，融融樂樂地顯示着團體生活的情趣。行禮知儀後，主席凌憲揚致開含詞。接着，錢新之先生生有剴切而精警的勗勉：</p>
<p>一人應該有職業，尢其應該有終身的職業。銀行業是新興的進步事業，原因就是多數，許身爲終身的事業……要忠于職業，應該戒絕不良的嗜好，提倡正當的娛樂。銀行界業餘聯誼會的組織在上海，漢口，重慶已提倡過，希望香港的不要開過會，成立了就算了事，應該提倡智育，補充新智識。陳腐的一套是不够用的，無論什麼新的經濟理論，新的經濟學說都得學習，才不會落伍。體育是很要緊的，兄弟參觀外國銀行，看看他們站着辦公的精神，實在是我們困弱的中國人所辨不到的。應該好好把身體鍛鍊起來，才幹得起入事。至於德育，羣育，重要性亦是顯而易見的，應該使它半均發展才好。……』錢先生說得很動聽，最末還很剴切地勗勉同人戒賭，戒嫖，戒早婚。並列舉很多食　目前享受而破家盪產的事實使人有所警惕</p>
<p>先生苦口婆心的精神不先爲畏者的風度，並謂杜月笙唐春民二先生因事阻不克參加，同時亦是代表他們二位的意忠。昨天的大會有了這樣的一席講詞，亦算是頗有收穫。必定有很多人會從慚愧之中奮發起來的。報吿籌備經過，給獎，討論，選舉，一　幕翻過去，有趣，有力，有熱的助興就使全塲興奮起來，緊張起來。節目計有業餘聯誼社的歌詠，粵劇，口琴，幻術。話劇有業餘劇團的，夜之歌與黑影二劇，並請蔡楚生，司徒慧敏諸戲劇家蒞場參觀，成績極爲美滿。還有商務書館歌詠隊參加歌詠，眞是極一時之盛。而小孩子喝采幻術的情態，尤其有趣。大致情形，則與前此業餘聯誼社成立時大同小異。記者寫　　特寫的興奮心情亦與元旦寫業餘聯誼社的一篇差不離。</p>
<p>來吧：繼業餘聯誼社，銀行業業餘聯誼會，各行的從業員都從個體到集體，從荒淫到嚴肅吧！</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>在中華藝術協進會幹部訓練班</p>
<p>陶先生講到這個地方，又是稍爲歇息一下。可是講　與聽者却絲毫沒有　色。陶先生繼續着說。。</p>
<p>『但是，我亦不反對同時在後方辦敎育。只是不要老八股與洋八股吧了。我們要把次要的課程　出來，加上　合抗戰的需要的課程。有一個很重要的原則應該　守的：就是後方的組織與訓練應該與前方的需要相配合。記得嘗有一個時候，晤見了一位醫學院的院長，當時我就敦促他趕緊訓練醫學人才。爲抗戰出點力量。那位院長很得意的說：「老旬：醫學並不像別的東西啊！要能够服務，起碼總　五年，並不是可以馬虎的』。當時我的答覆就是：『現在方將士死于瘧疾，死于痢疾，死于流血流不住的佔最多數。請問訓練專門醫治這種　病的人材要不要五年？」「那麽，假如是培養樣的人材，是無須這樣長久了』『那就對了！老哥！請你快快訓練一大批這樣的人材去醫治我們前綫的將士去救救我們英勇的將士。至於要養成解剖與取出子彈的人材，我不反對你的五年訓練』。後方的組織與訓練要與前方的需要相配合，這就是一個具體的例子。</p>
<p>囘憶幾個月前廣州未淪陷以前，中山大學有一位朋友問我：你看中山大學要不要搬？我的答案是：『快　！快搬！快搬！』理由就是：儀器是要錢買來的；訓練了一個大學生亦不是容易的。可惜　們不搬，等到廣州淪陷遺着莫大的損失。</p>
<p>最近，又是在廣西晤見這位老朋友，他又是問我：你看中大要不要冉從廣西搬到雲南去？我的答案是：不要搬！不要搬！不要搬！理由是雲南離廣東太遠了，在廣西還可以參加保衛廣東的工作。用搬遷費來構築防空壕是綽有餘裕的。第二個原因，是雲南的大學太多了，實在冉沒有添加一個的必要。</p>
<p>可是我並不是機械的反對在雲南辦敎育。倘使那裏最高學府不太多，而又念念要把力量輸送到前方去，那末，是沒有人反對的，</p>
<p>因此在後方辦敎育，是不可在百年大　的盾牌下躱懶，要時時刻刻顧念到抗戰的需要，即是顧念到建國的需要。倘使抗戰不成，什末都完，所謂百年大計，都變成奴隸之計。所以最要緊的，在後方辦敎育首要在增加抗戰的力量，否則躱在山洞裏，仍舊爲敎育而敎育，那便是逃走敎肯。</p>
<p>陶先生講到這裏，聽者又深深受其感動。陶先生還是很起勁地說：</p>
<p>『我們自身的敎育在過去是片面的，現在亦應該全面起來。全面的自我敎育，就是要：看，想，玩，談，幹。當然我們有兩眼；就得看，有腦袋，就得想；有張嘴，就得談；有疲勞，就得玩；有雙手，就得幹。我們要爲　而看，爲幹而想，爲幹而談，爲　而玩。幹是生活的中心，亦即敎育的中心，幹什末？抗戰建國！</p>
<p>抗戰建國是要：</p>
<p>眞幹，不可假幹；</p>
<p>窮幹，不可浪費的幹；</p>
<p>合幹，不可分裂的幹；</p>
<p>快幹，不可慢慢的幹；</p>
<p>大幹，不可小小的幹。</p>
<p>凡是假幹，浪費的幹，分裂的幹，慢慢地幹，或是小小的幹，都是可疑，我們應當追求證據，分別奸庸，來他一個適當的處置。敎育要通過生活才是有效的敎育；抗戰敎育要通過抗戰生括才是有效的抗戰敎育。</p>
<p>敎育是民族解放的武器，人類解放的武器。不展開到　個民族，整個人類，不够稱爲全　敎育。』</p>
<p>熱烈的掌聲，結束了這個緊張，嚴肅，活潑，有趣的演講會。　（完）</p>

<p>— 桐汰</p>
<p>一個夏天的早晨、東方才現出魚肚色、我們一行五人、便從旺角沿着彌　道向着大浦道前進、這時太陽還未有出來、　黑的遠山、因爲受不到陽光、還籠罩着乳白色的薄　、天氣陰沉黯淡、我們走了半個鐘頭光　、到了石水背、乘便參觀該處水塘、水塘有八座、黃坭的高山、繞着水塘的四週、造成一個窪地、高山頂上種着高聳茂密的松樹、水從左邊較　的山上的大鉄管流出、通到水塘、衝激着階石、濺起白色的浪花、發出濺濺的流聲、好像奏着音樂的美調、靠右邊的小徑進去、有一個山洞、洞畏約數十尺、從洞口向裏望去、只見洞的兩端稍爲光亮一點、中間却是陰森森的我們由山洞走過、地上很楚潮溼、我們走到洞的中央、空氣漸漸稀薄、覺得呼吸短促、過此便到一塊平坦的靑草地上、在這里休息了一會、再向山路走去、山路漸行漸高、嵯峨的山石好像劍鋒般突出于山路上、荆棘滿途、步履甚難、我們背着隨身物件向前走、沒有一點難色、精神奕奕不減于出征壯士、從山項繞着　徑下山、轉出康莊的大路、這時太陽已經升到高山頂上、天氣漸漸炎熱起來、大家似乎覺得有些　意了、然又繼續前進、行行重行行、不覺到了沙田車站、聽　離這里不還有一個勝　——車公廟——大家商量到那兒去遊玩、于是　明了士人的去處、繞着隴陌的小路走去、足足行了半個鐘頭、才到目的地、這廟建　在山脚下、前面朝着一片揷新秧的水田、廟的兩邊、種着靑葱的樹木、風景淸幽、我們得了該廟法師智林的引導、參觀佛座、裏面佈置十分雅潔、香爐裏燃着塔香、發散出淸郁的香氣、越顯出該廟的淸凈、置身其間，好　超出了　亂紛爭的塵世。把身心的煩悶愁苦滌了不少、遊玩了一回、時已十二時了、就在廟內午餐、齊菜可口、具有別種杳味、</p>
<p>在這里停留了一個多鐘、復整隊出發、大家因爲要　程到大埔去、便沿着火車路前進、走了二個鐘頭、穿過好幾個山洞、走得面紅耳赤、汁流浹背、可是所期望的目的地還望不到、這時大家心裏似乎焦急起來、然而心愈急、反覺得路途的遼遠，後來終于達到了目的地——大埔——大家卸了肩負，在大埔車站尋了一些茶水解渴，休息了片刻，到大埔墟內去逛逛，墟內街道狹小，山石砌路。凹凸不平，商店大小有數十間，各行各業都有，惟生意不甚暢旺，因爲九大（九龍與大埔）交通便利，竄費不多。（來回車票只三角半）居民大宗日常需甩貨物，多半向沖蔴地購買，所以大浦　大商店很少。這墟背山　海，風景有相當美好，軍政要人家眷避居來港者，多　地建屋宇于山上，由墟內到山上有一條狹長的山路，往來不覺其苦，我們是晚宿于山頂上的禮拜堂內，大家吃了兩個　包當飯餐。禮拜堂內的牧師，讓出敎堂裏的樓下給我們睡覺，各人把氈褥離開，橫臥直躺，好像塚上的骷髏，大家糊糊塗塗過了一夜，第二天早晨三時，由大埔向元朗進發、</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>當全面戰事發動以來、「潮汕』遂站在百粵國防最前綫、其地位之重要、實在要比平時關係密切十倍不止了、——「潮汕」這一個名詞、他是　括着汕頭、潮安、潮陽、澄海、普寗、揭陽、饒平、惠來、八縣市而言的、尤其汕頭是全潮汕的總稱紐、出洋的咽喉要道、工商業昀中心、近十年來的汕　、他已隨着時代巨輪盤轉入現代化的都市了、記者這次「潮汕一之行、汕頭乃爲旅行程序中的出發　囘歸綫、故在這篇旅行記中、亦得把汕頭作爲開筆的先鋒了、</p>
<p>汕頭、一打開地圖、就司以看出所佔的重要、雖萬噸的郵船不能駛入汕頭的港口、——媽嶼口、然而航行南洋北洋航綫的輪船、都能够一直汩到　石山旁以及潮海關前石是汕市炎夏裏唯一的避暑去處、外僑亦多關屋居於　峯的山腰、而且各國駐汕領事館亦多設在這裏、所以人多號該地爲第二鼓浪嶼、　是該地却是我國一塊完整的領士、外人沒有半點行政權、談起汕頭的交通事業、可以說是海陸空全備、不過在軍興以來、空內方面（飛機）已經沒有了、陸的方面依然是發展　、由汕到潮安的交通、有潮汕鐵路、護堤公路、到澄海有汕樟公路輕便車鐵路、潮陽除電船外、並且有省道車可通、往惠來普寗的交通、亦可由省道車直達、至於海外的航綫在上海香港新嘉坡暹羅安南、有外人經營的商航公司十二三家之多、所以汕頭港內海面、每天多有若干睡人樓船停泊、汕頭市區的馬路已開　得很完善、柏油的大道、柔軟有彈性、尤其外馬路爲全市的模範、市中心的小公園、日夜車馬喧鬧、一座縱橫萬畝方圓的中山公園、爲全嶺東冠、園中建設假山亭閣、動物園、花圃日漸完備、夏日湖心游艇、如過江之鯽、全園風景、亦非常壯觀、但是日機數次來轟炸汕頭、游園士女頓時銳減、且公園一部被劃入警戒區、這樣的一半深鎖一半開、熱烈的情况、與昔不可同日語了、汕頭考査潮州府誌內　、原屬澄海所屬、初名沙汕頭、因爲在二百年汕頭遠是一片突出海面的沙地、現在又有　江的一個名詞了、記者此次是由汕頭乘火車往潮安、車行二小時左右、抵達縣城、亦小暇參觀其他、　卽乘手車往湘子橋、及西湖一帶瀏覽、　座古城、是韓愈刺史牧民的　邑到現在文化水凖仍非常高超、湘子橋就是「九度文公十度妻』的韓湘子、後人命名的一座橋、橋是用十八隻梭船聯繫　成的、橋頭矗立特一隻鐵牛、但不知道是那一朝代的遺物、潮人有一句歌謠、說是「十八梭給廿四洲、二隻鐵牛一隻溜」相　鐵牛本有雌雄一對、在若干年前忽　被走去一隻母鐵牛、但有沒這一件事情、現在已無從　考了、湖子橋上開有十七八家商店、不幸在七月中日機在橋頭投下數彈、毀壞頗大、韓文公廟亦在鄰近、香火　很盛的、潮人迷信神佛教篤、城中神像在前年已被縣府統統歸納到城皇廟裏、離縣城西北有一座開元寺、是潮汕有名的古刹、建築十分宏　、記者因匆匆來去、所以潮安祗能作一次走馬看花、當日即　聯運車赴揭陽、杳潮　原名潮州、民國後始改名潮安、並且有鳳城的美號、記者在暮色　茫中到達揭　、住了一宿、第二天一早就去看被日機炸後的揭陽糖廠、但是所見到祗有一堆坵墟了、回來在揭陽城作一次巡　、城中的市容以及建設、比較潮安又要落後一點、城內到處栽種榕樹、所以揭　又有榕城的號稱、第三天黎明乘汕揭輪船　關頭、在關埠未有停留、雇了一乘小轎坐往潮陽、到潮陽已是中午、遠遠一高大石塔在望、塔名文光塔、潮陽人的語禾、發音　他縣粗濁、所以有一句俗語比潮　人、說是「寗願與潮安人相罵、不願與潮　人說話」、遭恐怕是潮陽　的難聽吧、潮陽北郊的名勝、有北宕小北宕等峯、宕上有寺院、小北宕的素菜聞名潮汕、寺僧作廚司、遊客抵此必欲大快朶頤、記者亦不惜費了二隻袁頭、食素菜四味、果然淸杳適口、名不虛傳、聞說所用炒菜的油、是經過三年埋臧地下、然後才拿出來用、故比較乎常的豆　不相同、立在宕上給對着的西宕亦遙遙在望、風景幽淸、大有出塵拔俗的氣象、素聞離潮陽二十里的海鬥、有一座蓮華峯、峯下有石室、從石縫中窺去、可看見離奇的預兆、能者亦爲好奇心所驅使、當卽乘潮海公路車　往、旣達目的地、亟急到石室一看、那知道事有出人意料之外、幾乎　至有興而來、敗興而返、原來自日艦窺伺潮汕沿海、海門時　日艦砲擊、防務緊急、故蓮花　一帶已禁止人游、記者來時未曾計及、但幸好　得特准到石室一看、然而看來看去、所謂神佛出現、一無所有、實在無稽騙人、記者為着行程的關係、又回到潮陽乘汽車往磊口、再轉車達濠、達濠是潮陽第二區屬、居民多捕魚爲業、但是爲着日艦的焚殺漁船、現多不敢出海捕魚、現在漁民的生活是艱艱極了、達邊區內有　場三處、現都　政府管理了、記者在達濠稍一逗留、亦卽趕回汕頭轉往澄海饒平兩縣、所以下午隨即乘汕達　船到汕、在汕頭休息一宵、第二天乘汕樟公路汽車往澄海、沿途未有停留、到澄海承友人李　作領導、在城內兜了一個人圈子、結果跑到酒樓中嘗試了澄海著名十產銀　和猪頭肉、這次澄海旅行的收穫、亦只有兩件食而已、本想去普寗惠來一遊、以一週旅行、舟車勞頓、身體疲乏極了、故原定計劃、不得不暫吿緩議了、</p>

<p>前綫有惠堂居中策應、不動則已、動則如江河、加以他的名器够大、射術驚人、故足跡所到之處、對方守將必合數人之力、加以阻止、甚至一憫頂好出擊的狄臣、也常被他所牽制、不敢輕於出擊、雖　惠堂的演出、禾　分出色、然而牽制敵術　他的成功、同時狄們也該原諒他此次扶創登　、乃係勉爲其難、且未終半場又屬傷腰部、因此他的發揮力、受相當影響、</p>
<p>所獲四球、多得力於側面敲擊、至於惠　的錨形突擊、則被監視過嚴、頗難施展、然四球之勝、他直接間接都有功勞、亦足見策　得法、</p>
<p>榮照進退有據、威風八面、在中塲應戰、演出眞工夫、尤其自許竟成受傷後、他兼顧的責任要大、截擊與出擊、一身担負起來、眞是難能可貴、</p>
<p>均幹演出看家本領、坐守禁城、至多佳作、尤其在最後二十分鐘內、敵、縱橫、驚險頻生、得賴他一雙妙手、力挽危難、看客　　、假如此時海軍扳回一球、便難保戰局不無再變化、放均幹之功、堪稱第一、</p>
<p>內衛侯容生羅偉　、不出記者所料、果然稱職、容生的打法、勇　矯捷、撞球蹴球、相當可取、惟近身纏人的工夫、尙欠純熟、偉權的打法、雖仍不晚前衛那種作風、然穩健可　、不過因與容生首次搭擋、位置上遂時有　在一起之弊、</p>
<p>成禾終半塲已受傷、勉强　戰、舉動欠靈、然他尙能力纏岩士德郞、使難得逞、功不可沒、曾仲云遇着厲害的墾地、頗爲吃苦、然以始終費力、亦覺可　、</p>
<p>前綫鄒文治、運球上前、甚有路　、和侯澄滔也依然合作、卓石金够勇、演出不錯、而陳炳土多得活動、乃由石金時予以接　的、因而整個　綫、　收側擊之效</p>
<p>海軍之敗、非技不如人、其貫、他們的聯絡、比華聯更好一點、祗以諸　射門沒把握、故麽攻不得手、　隊十一人、以狄臣表演最佳、韓尼維路亦不、所以在中塲混戰、海軍的形勢較好、懇地、史披拉、亦甚出色、傳供機會多多、但射術不靈、徒勞無功、</p>
<p>球經談過、且述戰情、兩陣排成如下、</p>
<p>華人聯隊</p>
<p>譚均幹　羅權　侯容生　許竟成　梁榮照　曾仲云　侯澄滔　鄒文治　李惠堂　卓石金　陳炳土</p>
<p>海軍聯隊</p>
<p>希瑟　士地路　卑路斯　菲沙　狄臣　韓尼維路　墾地　拖設　軒地　史披泣　岩十德郞</p>
<p>近萬看客、來觀大戰、快活谷中、哄動一時、海軍人馬遲到、四時方開火、</p>
<p>甫開接觸、石金、炳土、雙雙衝上、卑路斯攔途裁擊、殺了一陣、</p>
<p>一眨眼、石金又殺人、遠放冷箭、去勢甚慢、希瑟接着踢去、</p>
<p>澄滔越位後、惠堂初探營房、土地路出迎、惠堂未得再深入、乃引軍而退、</p>
<p>海軍前線、蠢蠢思動、但敵不過華聯守將、沒法前進、</p>
<p>已而、石金炳土聯　迫入、石金尤勇、一衝一踏、希瑟困守危城、搖搖欲墜、還虧他身手不錯、　成角球、直至惠堂余射、他交拖個滿懷、</p>
<p>岩十德郞一度侵來、被竟成偉　合力擊　、　邊廂、又見惠堂兩次遠射、但未中的、</p>
<p>懇地又來犯、容生當路、殺成角球、墾地開來很可怕、　幸均幹接　妙、跟着軒地衝殺。又厄於均幹之手、</p>
<p>正在此　、竟成　傷退出、文治立卽退守、以防萬一、</p>
<p>華聯士氣有加、不因竟成暫出而減少攻勢、突見炳土得球、飛奔而前、正是一鞭靑草路、十里白靈垂、旣近底綫、切中恰好、澄滔一廢、竟不中空鬥、高出　後、一般迷民、同聲嘆惜、</p>
<p>竟成復人、已欠　動、而此時海軍亦取得攻勢、華聯門前、發現敵　、弄到各守將、　覺頭痛、直至均幹抱球出險、才吿無事、</p>
<p>石金活動、得文治妙傳、乘空入蘭、看來頗有作爲、怎料放的過　炮、又失一個機會、</p>
<p>移時、炳士也找得出路、迫門一射、被　　擋出野外、</p>
<p>海軍突圍而出、又來犯禁、榮照退後、力戰拖般、把球踢　中央、惠堂接着一傳、送到炳土脚下、遂球而馳、一路無、旣近射門、雖未命中、然球適　石金　前、乃冉一　、惠堂提腿卽扣、惜乎中枉、替希瑟擋災</p>
<p>你來我往、塲告終、各無所獲、</p>
<p>休息　過、再動兵戎、華聯　鋒、益見　躍、未幾、惠堂得球卽傳、炳士切中、文治以頭一迎、希瑟見了着忙、把　拍出不遠、正在人馬雜査中、恰值炳士趕到、一剷入網、打開紀錄、一陣掌聲、震撼山谷、同時石金與卑路斯都受傷倒地、離塲未幾復人、</p>
<p>華聯先勝、士氣益盛、炳土再來　門、希瑟仆地扑出、祗是石金趕不上、否則希瑟將門禁又開了、</p>
<p>圍攻有頃、狄臣一聯解　、皮披拉、軒　、拖般、合兵　上、容生見狀、飛騰橫來救駕、怎得他剛跑到皮披拉的跟前、而球已發射、均幹的視綫、適被容生所阻、仆地救時、球已竄入網內、</p>
<p>一比一戰成平手、形勞簽爲緊張、既在中央再開、萬堂把球一般、送到左方、文治得着即射、希瑟冷不妨文治有此一舉、撲一個空、而球已入門、此球之　、與負去之球相隔時間不够一分鐘、直神速之至、</p>
<p>此時、爲華聯黃金時代、不旋踵、又見炳十妙傳、惜澄滔趕上遲一步、錯通良綠、</p>
<p>有頃、惠堂妙傳、澄滔一馬當先、賺過卑路斯、再迫走希瑟、一舉入網、造成三比一之局、</p>
<p>海軍一失再失、大舉反攻、墾地、拖般、幾次迫門而射、爲勢極險、看客心震、幸輯均幹妙手囘春、化險爲夷、</p>
<p>惠堂得機、單刀赴會、惜射不中、跟着石金高與狄臣爭球、又受傷離塲、眞是「將士軍前半死生」、海軍又來犯、弄到　幹　忙、然而他的好身手、却於此時盡顯起來、者客同聲贊賞</p>
<p>石金復入場、蘇聯政診又起、炳士得球傳中、恰到好處、惠堂一截一射、希瑟不知所措、抑亦欲救無由、　　球兒入綢、而華聯勝利、由此定了、</p>
<p>此後互爲攻守、仍多可觀、至號角畏鳴、兩軍乃收兵、四此一華聯得决賽　（球　太歲）</p>

<p>娛樂……郡主與侍者</p>
<p>Barouess　and　the　Butler</p>
<p>本是出名的舞台喜劇、現在改編電影、故事本身有着濃厚的喜劇趣味、更加上幽默明星威　飽　　、和安娜蓓拉費力的　作、使本片成爲一部極優秀極成功的作品、</p>
<p>威廉鮑惠爾飾一侍者、是某伯爵家中最能幹的僕人、對於家務各項、都處理得井井有條、伯爵全家對他皆極滿意、但事情出人意表的、這侍者竟暗中從事政治活動、而被選作議會議員、幷且是站在與主子敵對的黨派方面、在職業上他是一個矢忠主子的僕人、而在政治方面、却大發政論、無微不至的攻擊他的主子、那伯爵還算心胸寬闊、對他還有相的的諒解、最不服氣的還是伯爵的女公主、一個標準的貴族小姐　安娜蓓拉飾）、而在道糾紛矛盾的情形之下、鬧出了連篇的笑話、</p>
<p>片中有極美妙的對白、幽默詼諧中含有眞理、威廉飽惠爾的作風沒有改變、沉着鎭定之中、自有令人絕倒之處、安娜蓓拉在這部片中、還算是第一次在美國製的影片中出現、她也有極優秀的演出、</p>
<p>皇后……彩片精華</p>
<p>華脫狄斯奈、所監製的鋼筆畫片、是受每一個觀衆的讚賞與歡迎的、、特別是在他『雪姑七友』大胆嘗試的成功之後、更受一般愛好電影的觀衆們大大的注意、一場『彩片精華』的放映、都是選擇集合他最近的作品、片共十本、片名列下、</p>
<p>『獵狐記』、『怪鸚鵡』、『家畜交響曲』、『打球笑話』、『水晶宮王子』『銀年童』『捕鯨記」『幸運之日』『不鬭之牛』「巨人記』</p>
<p>各片的繪畫技術、以及色調音調的配合、皆是儘美　善、故事的取材簡短活潑、幷充滿着濃厚的趣味、除米基老鼠和唐納鴨之外、尙有新的創作、其中「不調之牛」、「水晶宮王子」、「銀　童話」、「巨人記』四部尤爲出色之作、</p>
<p>平安……摩登女探</p>
<p>The　Mad　Mfss　Mantoa</p>
<p>一部融合資羅曼絲和神秘晤殺案、而以諧趣瘋狂的格　演出的影片、白蓓蘭史丹妃飾一壞透了的交際花、無意中發現一尸首、報吿警署　及到偵緝　到、死尸已給兇手搬走了、因她平素的品行、人家以爲是她想出風頭而造出的一個謊話、這分明是寃枉了她、更使她吃不消的還是一個靑年的編輯（亨利方達師）、在報上對她冷戰熱嘲的　、於是料合了一班姊妹、進行偵緝的工作、在發現第二死屍之後、人家才同情相信她、特別是那身年編緝、給　大大的帮忙、那時候兇手想殺她以　口、虧得警探把兇手圍殲、方得幸免、</p>
<p>片中情節略缺可能性、但因各演員優秀的演作、遂使劇情的開展、自然輕鬆、暗殺案的編排也相當曲折但在片中幷未佔重要之地位、因爲本片藉似引人入勝者、不是緊張嚴重的偵探故事、而是濃厚的喜劇趣味、</p>
<p>東方……同共歌舞</p>
<p>Everybody　Sing</p>
<p>裘蒂珈倫主演、　的歌喉雖然不及狄安娜寶萍來得動人、可也新人中極出的人才了、寫一个戲劇狂的家庭所以、一切都是徧重在喜劇與歌舞方面、是一般好萊塢歌舞片的彩色、她不祗會唱歌、而表情也不差、亞倫瓊斯沒有像『情龍勸軍心』裏那樣出色、</p>
<p>大華……頑童小傳</p>
<p>The　Adventure　of　Tom　Sawyer</p>
<p>是一部很優容的文藝影片、就是　據馬克吐溫的厚　改總的、全片雖然很長、但導演處理得宜、那　輕快生動的　子、使我們並不覺得沉悶、一部份也因爲一輩童角出色的表演、尤其是兩個主角、飾姑母的梅　遜演出亦很好、彩色的攝製、更增加了本片的價値、</p>
<p>新世界……正一多情種</p>
<p>許曼麗鄜山笑主演</p>
<p>中央……珍珠衫</p>
<p>好萊塢的陳査禮逝世才不久，中國電影界便有陳査禮的產生、這種投機的手段、旣無須耗　宣傳之勞、而能坐收號召之效、中國製片家的聽明、於此可見一班、但本片內容故事的編　未能鐵　、同時各緊張塲面，也皆未能儘量發揮、對於盜匪　的行爲動作的描寫、失敗多於成功、演員之支配也不甚適合、除　瓊有相當成甚之外、顧蘭君和洪　鈴沒就戲做、徐羣園的陳査禮。面部化裝頗能近似、但動作方面的摹仿則尙未談得到、</p>
<p>普慶……粵劇</p>
<p>太平男女劇團</p>
<p>日演……賊家庭</p>
<p>夜演……響鼎明珠</p>
<p>高陞……粵劇</p>
<p>錦添花女劇團</p>

<h3 id="c52">為五中全會的收穫鬪 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 洛兒</p>
<p>五中全會目前正在會議明中。對于這個具有　大歷史意義的會議，全中國人民正以萬分然烈的情緒環繞　它，全中國人民正以高度底熾熱的希望傾注着它。</p>
<p>五中全會是在抗戰的新階段上召開的，它是在民族叛徒的被淸除，內外抗戰形勢更好轉的環境下召開的，同時它又是在×人發動其新的軍略進攻之下召開的，這次會議與今後抗戰的關係上，有着它莊嚴的意義和偉大的作用，這是今天的全中國人民，特別是從事文化工作的同志們，所須要深深認議的。</p>
<p>據十九日美聯社的重慶電，這次會議的內容非堂豐富的，響如，更進一步的强化軍事政治機構；嚴厲的擴，鋤好工作，沒收一切民族　徒的所有財產；減輕租稅，改善民生，以集中全民族的生動力量；修正三靑團團章，更進一步的團結全國靑年，擴大和發展全國靑年的統一戰綫組織；設立特別委員會，處理各黨派的合作事宜；建立國際反侵略戰綫等等，都是這次會議急不容緩的工作，同時又是全國人民所熱烈希望政府迅速解决的工作。</p>
<p>因此，今天文化界的工作者，面對着這樣一個五中全會，應負起下面五個任務。即一，把這次會議的意義，向羣衆進行普遍的宣傳解釋，舉行各種形式的座談會，慶祝會，乃至五中全會之後舉行檢討會等等。在種種形式的會議中，去提高羣眾對這次會議的翻心和認識。二，充分地把人民對於這次會議的希望和意見，反映出來；依據羣衆的生活環境和具體條件，提出各自特別感到需要和關切的問題，把它聯繁到第二期的抗戰的問題上來，使羣衆深切認識五中全會　直接關係整個抗戰，直接關係全國人民幸福的會議。三，將各種有關今後抗戰的意見和主張，作爲今後一切運動的目標，使每一個人自　地都了解必須以更積極的態度，去完成這此目標。四，文化工作者，在這新的形勢底下，應更加强其對政治問題的關切，把個人的生活和整個抗戰的政治生活統一起來，提高文化工作對於今後抗戰的積極作用。五，繼續文化上的鋤奸運動，這運動在目前具有特殊嚴重的意義。因爲親日的各種溪奸和日本帝國主義的特務機關，正無恥地企圖用各種卑劣的手段。來破壞這次五中全會，某漢好的報組，每天在散佈具可惡的謠言，每天在中傷政府，破壞抗戰，這工作的重要是任何一個人都明白了的。</p>
<p>上述的工作，不祗是在五中全會期中，文化界的同志們要熱烈地執行起來，尤其是在五中全會以後更須要熱烈的執行起來。</p>
<h3 id="c53">砰石樂昌往返記 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 兪堅</p>
<p>車子到彬州恰是薄暮，到樂昌已是深夜一時了，聽說明早便可以抵達廣州．</p>
<p>可是車子停了一小時，又是一小時，後來才知道是車頭上的什麽汽軸損壞了，修理了又修理，看看天亮了，而×機又是每天必來轟炸的，前進十分危險，於是車子在乘客的咒詛聲中退了囘去。</p>
<p>乘客的暴燥不安，給車窗外的美麗景色馬上撫慰半貼——公路沿着北江的上流，蜿蜓地爬去，西面不單是北江，還有矗立的山峯藏密的綠色樹木，難得看到有幾所赤褐色的木板小屋，北江裏有不少的白石灘，碧綠的水街到那兒，便像沸水似的激起更白的浪花來，江邊不時有條木排或是幾條小船。縮到車窗後邊去，於是聽到不少乘客在感謝着這次退囘來使他們能够看到在昨晚睡覺時失去的風景。</p>
<p>十時左右到了砰石，停下來修理，聽說修好了，於是在下午三時再開向樂昌。</p>
<p>抵樓昌站不久，便聽見飛機的　聲，乘客，小販，紛紛的散到田野裏去，飛機飛到頭上了，祗是打圈子，胆大眼細的站員，後來發現是自己的飛機，於是大聲的通知——乘客，這才重新聚攏來。</p>
<p>譙都給剛才不必要的躱避失笑了，這時一個站在我身旁的站員吿訴我一段這個月裏的×機故事：</p>
<p>不知是哪一天，有三架×人的轟炸機來炸轟漢路，裏邊有一架在俯衛後仰飛時，轉葉撞在山壁上墜下了。在下一天，又有兩隻敵機飛來，在頭頂上盤旋了又盤旋，最後看到一架飛機上投下一團東西，伏在地上的人，都在等待那劇烈的爆炸聲音，和飛起的泥土，可是什麽聲　都沒有，那時×機也很快的飛走了。</p>
<p>這是什麽一回事？誰都奇怪了，於是有個站員跑去看一下究竟，就在失事×機的附近，地上躺着兩個花園，花圈上結了一封信，信裏是廿元中央鈔票，和短短的一對信，太意是說：「我們都是被逼作戰的，並不是想屠殺責國人民，我們深信握手言好的時期不遠，信裏的念元鈔票，請拾得者作日機師埋葬之用，花圈亦請放在墳上』，云云。</p>
<p>車子到晚上九時還是不開，聽說機車又壞了，正在機廠修理中，於是漸　月台上聚滿了乘客，四處是不滿詰責的聲音，可是也有冷冷地說譏刺的話的，我就聽到那麽一句。</p>

<p>— 悠如</p>
<p>昨接珠君來信，說她弟弟　君於去歲出發東江前綫服務時，因病後過勞，暴卒博羅縣城，　君是我友人的兒子，此次爲國犧牲，於公於私均感悲痛。</p>
<p>記得去年，桐君不過十八歲，一向又是你母親　愛的獨子，却不聽家人的勸吿，毅然要加入壯丁隊，那時你激昻熱烈的氣槪多叫我感動，「我寧願死在戰塲也比呆住在家裏好。」你不是說過這樣激烈的話嗎？准知道話却眞成爲你自己的議請，</p>
<p>當你頭一回穿着壯丁隊的服裝，實行參加軍事訓練那天，你又是多麽的美奮，挺着有補，邁　脚步，昂然誇進屋裏來的你的姿態，我現在還很鮮明地記憶着。你一向是柔順聽話的，却漢漸地　得倔强了；一向是和易近人的，却漸漸變成勇猛潑辣了。你成爲槍的愛好者，恨不得抓一枝放在身邊。好讓你隨　聶殺×人和漢奸。你時時爲這而懊惱着，不明白政府爲什麽不發槍給你們。『阿桐什麽都變了。』你的母親很替你愛愁；她冉三要我勸阻你，然而，我爲什麽要勸阻你呢？你並沒有過錯，反之，我倒很同情你，你正跟別的中華民族的兒女們一樣，在民族革命戰爭的洪爐中已一天一天地給鍛練起來了。</p>
<p>黃沙的轟炸週年繼續着，每次你爲救護受傷的同胞都冒險到災區去，你太心急了。不等警服解除，仲　着要去，一次兩次你不是曾因此受傷嗎？如今想來，那時你不死於黃沙的轟炸中，那才是人大的奇蹟。</p>
<p>然而，說紀你的死，不由我不怪責你：你眞地太過心急了。你不應該在大病之後，連休息一會的心情也沒有，便鬧着要到前綫去，『×人就快打進來了，還休養什麽，我縱沒力氣拿槍殺×，就幹些救護運輸等工作也是好的。」你拿這做理由拒絕了我們的勸告，當你參加戰前服務團出發博羅那天，我看見你蒼白的臉龐，細弱的軀幹，就早爲你的身體　心，唉！誰想到你果眞爲着衰弱與過勞，喪失了生命！聽說你給抬囘寓裏那天，一躺就躺倒了，就這樣與我們永別了！</p>
<p>你不死於×人的轟炸，不死於可怕的陽熱病，却死在抗戰的前方，死於自己的職務上，這在你也許是冉痛快沒有甚事，你雖不能持槍殺×，戰死沙塲；但你　他們是同樣英勇，同樣壯烈的。</p>
<p>當我接到你姊姊來的信時，我忍不住一時的痛，眼淚幾乎要湧了出來。但我立刻就忍住了，我知道：哀痛對於你實是一種侮辱，你的死，我祗應該讃美與欽佩。</p>
<p>桐！你已經死了。在民族革命史上，自有你光榮的功續。那奮不顧身的精神，將永遠燜耀於你的朋友和同志們的心中；而且，對於他們，還是一種有力的鞭策興鼓勵。</p>

<h3 id="e1">China's Creditworthiness and British and American Interests <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>On the 15th, our Ministry of Finance announced measures for debt repayment, stating that debts guaranteed by customs duties would no longer be advanced for repayment, but only allocated according to the proportion of customs duties from non-war zones. It is noted that most of our government's foreign debts and indemnities are guaranteed by customs duties; domestic debts are either guaranteed by salt taxes or consolidated taxes, and newly issued domestic and foreign debts are mostly guaranteed by direct taxes such as income tax; and the Unified Rehabilitation Loan and the Gold Bond, etc., are also guaranteed by customs duties. Now that our country no longer advances foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties, it seems that it will affect the interests of Britain and the United States; on the other hand, it seems that our country's creditworthiness will also be questioned. We are willing to take a purely objective position and make a rational analysis.</p>
<p>First, the foreign debts managed by the Ministry of Finance and guaranteed by customs duties (as of January 1, 1939) include the Reorganization Loan, the Anglo-German Continued Loan, the British Boxer Indemnity, and the Sassoon Huai River Loan, totaling £24,611,367; and the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity and the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity, totaling £25,546,000. It can be seen that the result of the Japanese seizure of customs duties is a loss to Britain and the United States, not to our country, especially the damage to Britain is the greatest. Recalling that in 1938, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Horiuchi discussed the disposal of Shanghai customs duties, and the Anglo-Japanese Agreement on our country's customs duties concluded on May 3 stipulated that all customs revenues under the control of the Japanese military would be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, and from this deposit, the amount of foreign debt to be repaid would be allocated to the Inspector General of Customs to fulfill the obligations of foreign debt and indemnity guaranteed by customs duties. However, in fact, after the agreement was signed, only one million yuan of the Reorganization Loan was repaid, and other foreign debts were not repaid at all. At that time, Britain was satisfied with this agreement, so that even though our country protested, it was still unable to freely dispose of the tax funds. Therefore, although the motive for our country's refusal to advance debt guaranteed by customs duties today does not include the meaning of resistance, it cannot but be regarded as legitimate in law.</p>
<p>Second, our government has made its best efforts in recent years to maintain the creditworthiness of foreign debts. For example, in October 1936, the reorganization of the Fickes Aircraft and Marconi Wireless loans, and in April 1937, the Chicago Bank Loan and the Pacific Development Company Loan were successively established for repayment, designating salt tax as collateral. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all customs revenues in the war zone have been seized by Japan and deposited in Japanese banks, so that the accumulated amount of debt due but not paid by the war zone customs, which was transferred by our government to the Central Bank for advance payment, reached as much as 175 million yuan, which shows that our government is still trying its best to maintain creditworthiness during the war. Since the customs duties have been seized by Japan, making it impossible for our country to fulfill its debt repayment obligations, the essence is not that our country wants to default on its debts, and naturally there is no obligation to advance repayment.</p>
<p>Third, the Ministry of Finance's refusal to continue advancing debt guaranteed by customs duties is not due to any flaws in our country's war-time finances that make it impossible to maintain creditworthiness. The starting point is entirely a self-defensive economic war to prevent Japan from using our country's financial resources as a tool for aggression. Therefore, after doing its best to maintain the interests of Britain and the United States for a time, it can no longer maintain the interests of Britain and the United States while at the same time supporting [Japanese aggression]. Therefore, this is a necessary measure during the war, and the reason is not financial. In September 1938, our country temporarily suspended the repayment of the principal of the Crisp Loan and the Anglo-French Loan due to Japan's interception of all salt taxes in the war zone, which was also the same reason.</p>
<p>Fourth, although our Ministry of Finance does not allow further advance payment of debts, it is still doing its best to maintain creditworthiness, in order to prevent the interests of Britain and the United States from being damaged. The Ministry of Finance's statement has clearly stated that in the future, for all long-term debts borrowed before the war guaranteed by customs duties, the amount due will be allocated to the Central Bank on a regular basis according to the proportion of customs revenues from non-war zones. If the customs offices in the war zones hand over the arrears of indemnity payments that have been deposited to the Inspector General of Customs as before, our government will still allocate debt funds as before to restore the pre-war situation. Therefore, if Britain and the United States do not maintain their interests in the Far East, but are determined to maintain their interests in the Far East, they should urgently cooperate to restrain Japan, so that our country's customs administration is independent and fully free, which indirectly means that their own interests can be reasonably maintained and protected.</p>
<p>In short, our country's decision not to advance debt guaranteed by customs duties this time is not due to the difficulty of war-time finances affecting the maintenance of creditworthiness, but entirely the result of Japan's seizure of customs revenues, which is in fact beyond reproach. We only hope that the British and American countries can have a more detailed analysis and a more profound understanding of the overall situation in the Far East for their own interests, realize that their claims are in danger due to Japan's aggression, no longer ignore them, and unite to sanction Japan with more effective measures, and act with the utmost speed. Only in this way can their claims - all interests in our country - be reasonably maintained and protected!</p>

<p>— Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>And Other Important Tasks for Improvement of Units (4)</p>
<p>To obey orders and proceed accordingly is to find the path to survival; to disobey orders, to outwardly comply but in reality not execute them, is to find the path to death. If we soldiers do not obey orders, do not earnestly execute orders, the personal injustice of losing our lives is a small matter, but harming our superiors, harming our subordinates, harming our allied forces, and consequently harming the nation and its people, and harming generations of descendants is a great crime. Therefore, to fulfill our duties, complete our missions, preserve our lives, and elevate our lives, we can only obey orders and thoroughly execute orders. Everyone must explain this principle to the general soldiers, and must assist superiors in earnestly executing orders, leading by example, influencing subordinates, and cultivating in subordinates the habit of absolutely obeying orders and thoroughly executing orders. This is the greatest task of our chiefs of staff. Currently, commanding officers at all levels often issue orders casually; the transmission of orders is also often done irresponsibly; as a rule, the commanding officer issues an order to the staff, the staff hands it to a messenger, and the messenger delivers it, considering the matter complete. Whether the order is delivered on time, whether it is executed after delivery, and whether the execution is thorough are all ignored. With such a spirit unable to be instilled, many orders are not carried out, and are even shelved, causing untold delays. Therefore, from now on, we must demand that orders be carried out to the end and earnestly implemented, with strict supervision. The method of supervision may be occasional inspections or periodic assessments, to ascertain whether the orders issued have been faithfully executed and whether the execution has been effective. All urgent orders, or orders delivered to important locations, must have personnel assigned to supervise their implementation. If necessary, our staff officers should personally supervise each unit; otherwise, with the ingrained habits of the general troops, the more difficult an order is to implement, the more reluctant they are to execute it. Would this not mean that the more urgent the order, the more likely it is to be mishandled, especially for guerrilla warfare and special operations? If no one supervises the orders, you can order them to engage in guerrilla warfare, but they might not attack. The malpractices are even worse! Therefore, for important orders issued to various guerrilla teams and special operations teams, the headquarters must send personnel to supervise them, so that they can be thoroughly implemented!</p>
<p>Third, we must emphasize the education of messengers and communications personnel, and pay attention to sealing off news from the war zone. The education of messengers and communications personnel in the troops should follow the principles of "swiftness," "accuracy," and "secrecy." The transmission of orders and the relay of information should take "swiftness," "accuracy," and "secrecy" as essential requirements. If it is not secret, the contents of orders and communications can easily be leaked; if it is not accurate, there may be errors or omissions, and the recipients of orders and messages will be at a loss, or even execute them incorrectly; if it is not swift, it will not save time, and may even delay opportunities. Therefore, the transmission of orders and communication within the troops must be carried out in accordance with these three principles, and must be done in a solid and reliable manner, without the slightest negligence or delay. To achieve this, we must pay special attention to the technical training and spiritual education of messengers and communications personnel. In terms of technology, they must not only be proficient, but also strive for perfection, and be able to conduct on-the-spot research and make discoveries; in terms of spirit, they must be able to fulfill the requirements of swift, accurate, and secret transmission of all orders and communications, not only in places where traffic is convenient, communications are easy, and order is peaceful, but also in situations where traffic is difficult, equipment is simple, the war situation is urgent, time is pressing, or enemy fire is fierce and passage is difficult, they must be able to complete their tasks in accordance with the above three principles! If this cannot be achieved, it will affect military affairs and lead to defeat. Everyone should recall the losses suffered in the half-year of resistance since the start of the war because of delays in the transmission of orders and inadequate communication. Although there were many reasons for our past failures in the war of resistance, a detailed examination reveals that delays in transmitting orders and communications were a major cause. In particular, slow transmission, failing to strictly adhere to deadlines, caused the greatest harm. We must understand that our fighting is a race against time. Whichever action is quick and seizes the opportunity first will be victorious, and the opposite will be defeated. To be quick in action and save time, we need agile transmission and communication without any delay. This is the most important thing related to the success or failure of the war of resistance, and everyone must pay close attention to it. As for sealing off news, it is to prevent all news and information from our side from being leaked. Therefore, there must be strict organization and training of the people in the war zone and the rear, and the military and civilians must cooperate to eliminate all traitors and spies of the aggressors, so as to achieve the goal of strict blockade!</p>
<p>Fourth, we must study the performance of weapons and master the skills of using them. The most common shortcoming of today's general troops is that they do not know the performance of new weapons, resulting in improper storage and unskilled use. Even if they have new and sophisticated weapons, they cannot exert their full effectiveness. Often, a weapon can be used by foreign troops for two or three years, but when it gets into our hands, it breaks after only one use; when others' weapons break, they can immediately repair them themselves, but our officers and soldiers mostly lack the knowledge and skills to repair equipment, and even abandon them when they break, without even trying to repair them! Furthermore, the same weapon can be used skillfully by others to maximize its effectiveness and unleash its power, but when it gets into our hands, its effectiveness is reduced and its power cannot be brought into play because of unskilled use. If this shortcoming is not effectively improved, the future of the war of resistance is truly dangerous! In the future, to reorganize the troops and strengthen their combat power, we must pay attention to the study of the performance of new weapons and the training of usage skills. Whether it is rifles, light and heavy machine guns, mortars, or various cannons, after receiving them, our chief of staff must first gather officers in charge at all levels for careful research and practical testing. They must fully understand the performance of each weapon and the methods of using it, and must stipulate detailed methods for storage and use, to train the general officers and soldiers. During training, we must be realistic and strive for perfection, explaining things clearly and then asking questions, practicing well and then mastering it. If practice during the day is not enough, we must also practice at night, striving for pure skills and proper use. To ensure accuracy, our commanding officers must select several soldiers from each regiment every week for face-to-face testing and detailed guidance, so that all officers and soldiers in the entire army can be familiar with the performance of various new weapons and have proficient skills, so that they can exert the effectiveness of new weapons!</p>
<p>Fifth, intelligence must be accurate and plans must be thorough. The biggest bad habit of today's troops is inaccurate intelligence, incomplete plans, embellished accounts of battles, and false reports of victories. And the root of the problem lies in the word "hypocrisy." With this word of hypocrisy in their minds, all kinds of ills arise! In the future, to improve the ingrained habits of the troops, we must first break down hypocrisy and demand reality in everything, especially for our staff personnel in charge of intelligence and planning, who must take "reality" as the only principle for managing their work. For all information about the enemy, whether it is a report or a notice, we must strive for accuracy; with accurate intelligence, plans can then be thorough; with thorough plans, there will be confidence in battles. For example, when we win a battle, we must report truthfully about where we advanced, where we occupied, how many we captured, and how many we lost; or when we lose a battle, we must report truthfully about how many officers and soldiers were wounded or killed, how many weapons were lost, where the enemy advanced, where our troops retreated, and the reasons for victory or defeat, without vague terms or any exaggeration or cover-up. When our reports are truthful, we will have an accurate estimate of our own strength, and we can accurately understand the strengths and weaknesses of all aspects of the troops. Then we can give full play to our strengths, make up for our shortcomings, assess the situation, and win victories. Everyone must understand that when we went to war with Japan this time, we were inferior to them in terms of military preparations and material resources, but what did we rely on to dare to fight against them? What we relied on was the word "reality," this spirit of "reality." We relied on the truly practical awareness of the entire nation, gathered the strength of the whole country, to break the enemy's conspiracy of hypocrisy, deception, aggression, and oppression. This is to "attack falsehood with reality," to "rectify evil with righteousness," which is what is called a real war! It does not matter that our national power is weak and our resources are poor, and it does not matter that we lose battles and retreat from our positions. If we know that our national power is weak, we have ways to turn weakness into strength; if we know that our resources are poor, we have plans for poverty. As long as we can be practical, exert real strength, seek truth from facts, not boast when we win, not conceal our defeats, observe the real situation, make practical plans, speak truthfully, do practical things, and fight real battles with real strength, we can overcome all difficulties and turn defeat into victory! When you return to your troops, you must tell your commanding officers these words of mine. In the future, whether it is self-cultivation, managing affairs, leading troops, or fighting battles, everything must be practical. If we can carry out the spirit of reality, we will definitely achieve final victory!</p>
<p>Sixth, we must pay attention to the protection and inspection of warehouses, food, and ammunition. Food and ammunition are vital to the lifeline of the army, and we must always estimate the needs of the front line and make full preparations. We must also order our subordinates to take good care of them, and not allow them to be lost, damaged, or wasted. This is another of the most important tasks for our chiefs of staff. In particular, we must inspect the warehouse in various places on time, and accurately count all the stored firearms, ammunition, and food as a basis for assessment.</p>
<p>Seventh, we must pay attention to preserving old uniforms. Now in wartime, the national economy is very difficult. In peacetime, troops' uniforms can be issued according to regulations, replacing the old with the new. In the future, due to a lack of materials, it is not known whether they can be issued on time. Therefore, officers and soldiers must pay attention to preserving the cotton uniforms, cotton coats, military caps, and leggings that they take off, and must inform the general officers and soldiers that each set of uniforms must be used for at least two years during wartime, and the cotton clothing that is taken off this time must be kept for wearing this winter. When winter comes, they will not be issued again!</p>
<p>Eighth, we must cherish mules and horses. The horses of the cavalry and the pack animals of the transport teams are the most needed tools for combat, and we must take special care of them. Whether marching or camping, we must take care of them thoroughly. Every day, we must wash and groom the horses on time, and feed them grain and water on time. Especially on long marches, the burden must not be too heavy, water must be supplied on time, and when marching and camping, we must also urge the soldiers to wash them thoroughly; only after the mules and horses have been washed can the soldiers rest. Currently, the soldiers in various troops do not cherish mules and horses at all, either letting them die of hunger and thirst, or overburdening them to death. All kinds of negligence and carelessness harm the transport tools, which harms the army's transport. In the future, our officers must take the spirit of "diligence in small matters" and "love me, love my dog" to supervise our subordinates and improve this.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned matters regarding the improvement of the troops are all based on actual situations and opinions obtained by synthesizing reports from various parties. After everyone understands them, they must take them back to the troops and earnestly improve them accordingly. I have spoken a lot about the other matters that should be improved in the troops in the collection of lectures on the Review of the War of Resistance and the Essential Secrets of Certain Victory. Everyone must also take them all and study and implement them. In addition, everyone must also examine each of the instructions and orders related to tactics, strategy, and the improvement of the troops issued by the Military Commission in the past, and study them and assess them from beginning to end. In addition, the operational experiences and opinions presented by officers from various places and foreign advisors have been compiled into booklets, which have been distributed to everyone today. Everyone must also study them carefully, which will greatly benefit staff operations and the future of combat!</p>
<p>In short, the situation of the enemy aggressors is now caught in a dilemma. The further they advance, the more their forces are dispersed and the more difficulties they face, and the easier it is for us to eliminate them. Moreover, we see that their military discipline and morale are so bad that they cannot be remedied, committing rape, murder, arson, and looting, doing everything without any humanity! They also said that they would rely on superior weapons and rush headlong to eliminate us. They really despise us to the extreme and are arrogant to an unparalleled degree! With such licentiousness, greed, and cruelty, their spirit cannot but be decadent and their will cannot but be weak. The corruption and weakness of their army can be imagined from this! No matter how good their weapons are, it does not matter! In the future, we must tell the general officers and soldiers about the aggressor's fraudulent, arrogant, and corrupt situation, and raise our spirit of attack. Can't our revolutionary army block this army of beasts and this corruption and defeat them and annihilate them? Since the start of our war of resistance, the capital has fallen and even the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen is not protected. Our compatriots in the occupied areas such as Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, and Taiyuan are suffering the aggressor's brutal killings every day, living an inhuman life. Our soldiers are truly ashamed of their consciences! Especially as commanders-in-chief, we have an undeniable guilt for the great humiliation suffered by the country and the great calamity suffered by our compatriots. The ancients said, "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every man." How much more so for us soldiers! We must engrave it in our hearts, sleep on brushwood and taste gall, to avenge the country and avenge the dead soldiers and compatriots! I believe that everyone shares this feeling! I hope that everyone will tell this intention to the general officers and soldiers, so that everyone knows that if they do not kill the aggressors and defeat the aggressors, not only the compatriots in the occupied areas will suffer the aggressors' brutal killings, but also all the people of the country in the future, even our own parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, wives, children, relatives, and friends, will suffer the aggressors' humiliation and slaughter. In any place, we will have no place to stand and no place to be buried. If we do not give our lives on the battlefield now and die for the country, we will only regret it for the rest of our lives and will have no chance to serve the country again. Whether for public or private reasons, for the country or for ourselves, we must be determined to "either have the aggressor or have me, either have me or have no aggressor," know our shame and be determined to fight to the death to win our country's independence and the survival of our nation! (The End)</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor: Requesting Guidance from Mr. Zhang Junmai by Lin Beili</p>
<p>Greetings to Elder Junli: Since coming west, I have long wanted to visit you, but due to being tied up with affairs, I have repeatedly failed to do so. Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper a piece entitled "An Open Letter to Mr. Mao Zedong." Upon reading it, the words were lengthy and the sentiments were heavy, truly the words of a benevolent man. However, a student like Beili, after repeatedly reciting it, found much that she did not understand, and secretly suspects that what the elder says will not only be insufficient to move Mr. Mao, but will cause those who are enthusiastic about the war of resistance and unity not to weaken their beliefs because of Mr. Mao's report, but will instead cause a gradual increase in suspicion and friction because of the elder's letter, and even intensify. The impact may be more than the elder says: "energy is consumed in suspicion and friction." If so, then the elder may also regret his rash words, but it will be too late!</p>
<p>The elder's letter lists three points, which can be summarized as all being intended to support the central government and consolidate its authority. It is a pity that what is said is mostly contrary to the facts, not only is the theory not perfect, but also because the facts are distorted. If, unfortunately, those who do not read the elder's letter well mistakenly suspect that the anti-war military and political affairs are not unified and unreasonable, then the authority of the central government will be weakened, and the division of factions will be deepened. As the saying goes, "There is nothing wrong with the world, but mediocre people trouble themselves," which is not the original intention of the elder when he wrote this letter!</p>
<p>The elder said: "The army should belong to the country, and the army should not be associated with particularism." This is wrong. Any country in the world must have a way to establish itself, and the way to establish a country is ideology. Therefore, the army can be a tool of the country on the one hand, and on the other hand, it must be able to fight for the ideology that establishes this country. Only then will the army have value, and the bloodshed of its soldiers will not be a meaningless sacrifice. If it is only proclaimed that "the army should belong to the country," then the state of Manchukuo also calls itself a country, and has obtained the recognition of the German state that the elder worships. Should we also lead our army to belong to it? Not only that, but the puppet organizations in Central China and North China also claim to represent the Chinese state. Should we also lead our army to belong to them? If we do not ask about the ideology that establishes the country, but only ask whether it belongs to the country or not, it will inevitably lead to the sacred army that defends the country, and all foreign invaders and rebellious traitors who usurp the country can use its power to achieve their goals. How dangerous this is! Has the elder ever thought about this? Or is ideology not something special? The so-called special and correct are only from the opposition of objectivity and subjectivity. Moreover, the Republic of China is established on the basis of the Three Principles of the People, which is known to the world. The elder must want the army of the Republic of China not to belong to the Three Principles of the People but to the empty and boundless country. Those who know may suspect that the elder is negligent in choosing his words, and those who follow him may even suspect that the elder is close to advocating for Japan, Manchukuo, and puppet organizations, and opposes the Three Principles of the People and the Republic of China, which are unanimously obeyed by the whole country. Even if the elder is given the name of a general who touches the army, it is not impossible. I don't know how the elder can explain himself? "Communism is the ideal of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the Principle of People's Livelihood is the practice of communism." Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, often earnestly told his comrades in the Kuomintang several times. The elder still has things to say. "Seeing a camel and being frightened by a horse with a swollen back" is like this? At this point, Beili sighed even more that the elder is truly worthy of being the leader of the state and social parties that he spread and arranged. It is appropriate that he does not know what the Three Principles of the People are and does not know what communism is.</p>
<p>The elder also said that the border area government is like a separatist regime, which is even further from the facts. The origin of the original border area government is due to the situation of mutual dependence between the people and the military in the north after the war of resistance. Everyone in the occupied area knows this, and everyone praises its system. Therefore, this is a product of wartime, not a permanent organization that will not change. Even now, the central government recognizes it in fact, and also knows that it is beneficial to the war of resistance. Moreover, the word "border area" is added to the government, and it also receives assistance from the central government at the same time. Even in terms of name, it is already the same as the provincial government, municipal government, and county government of the central government. If, as the elder said, should all the provincial governments, municipal governments, and county governments of the Republic of China be abolished as well? Those who know know that it is impossible. Therefore, the elder's so-called separatism is also "shooting at a target that does not exist."</p>
<p>Finally, the elder questioned the Communist Party's efforts in the national struggle as abandoning class struggle, and then said that "it is better to put aside the teachings of Marx for the time being." This is even more laughable. For a party of one class, a party with internationalism, to advance together with parties of several classes to engage in a country's external struggle, this has its supreme significance. What is the significance? Today's war of resistance, on the surface, is only a country's external struggle, but in reality, this country's struggle is not just a struggle between one country and one nation against other countries and nations, but also a nation that bears the obligation to struggle for the peace of all the world's nations on the basis of its own and national liberation, and to further develop this epoch-making mission. The world's most oppressed proletariat will naturally be liberated when this great mission is completed. Those who are loyal to Marxism-Leninism should do everything they can to achieve it. This is one: Secondly, the so-called "put aside for the time being" is certainly something that politicians and bureaucrats are good at doing, but those who are loyal to a certain ideology or truly believe in a certain theory will not bear to say this. Moreover, to treat the Chinese Communist Party today in this way is not only disloyal to communism, but also untrustworthy to the Kuomintang. If the elder expects the Communist Party to be supervised by the disloyalty and untrustworthiness of politicians and bureaucrats, what will the countrymen and gentlemen think of the elder? This is two: As for the elder's intention in this letter, there may be entrustment, and the words are not entirely fair. Those who are slightly aware of the political situation today can know this in detail, which is not something that a woman dares to know. Only because my late father was close to the elder in Japan, and my family often praised the elder's love of learning, I forgot my own shallowness and dared to ask you something. I hope the elder will think about it again, then the war of resistance will be fortunate!</p>

<p>Two: A Series of New Experiences and Lessons</p>
<p>In this struggle where the × people launched a large-scale siege against the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region and the entire military, government, and people of Jin-Ji-Cha crushed the × people's massive siege, we have indeed gained many new experiences and lessons. These are described in detail below:</p>
<p>Regarding the × People:</p>
<p>The × people's siege of the border region was due to the consolidation and expansion of the border region, the resilience of its armed forces, and the repeated failures of previous offensives. Therefore, their strategic and tactical approaches were more thorough, planned, cautious, and persistent than before. The main manifestations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Political Capital" and "Appeasement Policy"</p>
<p>First, before the × people launched this siege of the border region, they first conducted sufficient preparatory work. Not only did they gather their forces on each offensive starting line, conduct mobilization for the siege, and strengthen morale, and drive traitors and bandits to create disturbances in the border region and act as vanguards for the offensive against the border region. They also created many rumors among the people, deceived the masses, used airplanes to distribute various leaflets, and promoted the so-called "New People's Morality." They also engaged in mad dog-like scolding and slander against our anti-× political elbows and various anti-× parties, attempting to create "political capital" for the offensive against the border region among the people, provoke discord among the parties, military, and people of the border region. At the same time, perhaps because the × people already felt that relying solely on military offensives, cruel burning, killing, suppression, looting, and poison gas attacks could not conquer the Chinese people's consciousness of resisting ×, they also adopted an "appeasement policy" in this siege, carrying out the work of "consoling" the farmers. Therefore, the × people's political conspiracies and sabotage in this siege of the border region were more severe than in previous sieges.</p>
<p>(2) Thorough and Cautious Combat Deployment</p>
<p>Second, they mobilized over 50,000 elite troops, strengthened their technical weapons, and formed a number of detachments, each ranging from 2,000 to 7,000 troops. Taking the four railway lines of Pinghan, Pingsui, Zhengtai, and Tongpu as starting points, they adopted a "separate advance and convergence" deployment, launching a large-scale encirclement attack on the center of the border region. However, because they feared being defeated individually by our army, each detachment was mostly composed of a mixture of various arms, possessing independent combat capabilities. Moreover, close coordination was maintained between detachments, maintaining mutual response and cautious action, no longer like the past when isolated troops went deep.</p>
<p>(3) "Step-by-Step Advance" and Strong Depth Deployment</p>
<p>Third, when the × people's detachments advanced towards the border region, they generally adopted a "step-by-step advance" approach. When advancing from one stronghold to another, if our army was discovered, they only advanced ten or eight miles a day. Upon arriving at a location, especially the troops attacking key transportation points, they first constructed strongholds, repaired city walls, and mopped up nearby anti-Japanese forces, making defensive advances and retreats to prevent attacks by our army. For example, the × advancing from Datong, Yangyuan, and Yuxian had conducted a lengthy mopping-up operation in the Sanggan River valley. The × entering Quyang, Daying, and Fanshi also stopped construction work. At the same time, to prevent us from breaking through a part of them, prevent guerrillas from threatening their flanks and rear, and destroying rear communication lines, their advancing troops also mostly adopted a strong depth deployment.</p>
<p>(4) Rapid Communication and Mobilization, and Continuous Supply</p>
<p>Fourth, the × people's detachments mostly advanced towards the border region along transportation routes and worked hard to repair the automobile roads of various key lines to ensure the smooth flow of their rear communications. Rapid communication and mobilization, and continuous supply, have almost become an important part of the × people's offensive. × National Assembly member Ozaki once said, "The most important condition for defeating China is that the rear is not cut off." The × people know that the people in the border areas have already carried out tense combat mobilization and thorough clearing of the fields and emptying of houses. It is impossible to loot the people's property to supply the troops' provisions, especially the necessary supplies for the technical guards, and there is no way to obtain them. Therefore, every time they arrived at a stronghold, they immediately connected the automobile roads of each stronghold and stored provisions and ammunition to maintain them for a long time. If they encountered mountainous terrain, which was difficult to repair the automobile roads at once, they changed to carrying them in large quantities. The × attacking Wutai from Meng County carried over 100 mules and horses, or used airplanes to transport them. However, these methods are ultimately limited.</p>
<p>(5) Divide the Border Region and Attempt "Area Sweeps"</p>
<p>Fifth, the × people know that the border region has a vast territory and possesses the strategic advantages of the two major mountain ranges of Wutai and Hengshan. The border region's armed forces have rich experience in guerrilla warfare and mobile combat, and strong combat capabilities. It is impossible to "annihilate" all the main forces of the border region's army in one fell swoop. Therefore, they attempted to use a large force to penetrate deep into the border region along the main transportation lines, dividing the entire border region into many small pieces, in order to reduce the maneuvering ground of our army, make our actions inflexible, disperse our forces, and weaken our army's mobile forces. Then, they would proceed to carry out "area sweeps" to achieve the goal of annihilating our active forces or causing our army to transfer to other areas. However, this goal has never been achieved because the × people were constantly attacked by our army.</p>
<p>(6) Assembled Actions, Echeloned Advance, and Poison Gas Attacks</p>
<p>Sixth, although the × people knew that our army's equipment and firepower were weaker than theirs, they were deeply afraid of our army's sudden attacks. Therefore, each detachment of the × people mostly took cautious assembled actions, meticulously guarding against attacks, firing guns and artillery everywhere, conducting powerful searches, deploying a part of their forces to advance, while the rest of the main force adopted an echeloned formation. When our army was discovered, they used powerful and dense firepower to suppress us, stubbornly resisting, or breaking through a point. In times of crisis, they often used poison gas attacks and used a number of aircraft to cover and bomb our army's positions, dropping poison gas bombs. If the main force of our army was discovered in one direction or was attracted by it, the detachments in other directions could also flexibly make rapid advances.</p>
<p>(7) Deception and Suppression Go Hand in Hand</p>
<p>Seventh, with the progress of military offensives, the × people's political offensives also became very active, adopting an "appeasement policy," buying over and deceiving, creating discord and spreading rumors, promoting "Eastern Morality" and "New People's Morality," undermining our national unity. On the one hand, they actively "destroyed" all anti-Japanese organizations, suppressed the people's anti-× sentiments, especially suppressed the active anti-× elements among the people and called on the people to return home, attempting to organize maintenance associations and puppet vehicles.</p>
<p>(8) Burning, Killing, Looting, and Poisoning are Carried Out Simultaneously</p>
<p>Eighth, they carried out large-scale burning, killing, and poison gas attacks, in an attempt to carry out large-scale economic destruction. Not only were the people's grain, agricultural tools, and houses mostly burned, but livestock were also mostly killed and looted. Moreover, they adopted vicious means to destroy finance, release poison, inject poison needles, use airplanes to bomb everywhere, create a terror situation, and drop poison bombs. When the × people retreated, poison was released along the way, causing a large number of our soldiers and civilians to be poisoned. These means can be said to be the ultimate in brutality, cruelty, and meanness.</p>
<p>On Our Side:</p>
<p>The ferocious × people, relying on their elite and massive military strength, thorough plans, vicious means, and the coordination of the army and air force, launched a large-scale siege against the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region with a fierce momentum. This is indeed a serious situation for the still young Xi-Ji-Cha Border Region. However, the people's government and army of the border region, under firm leadership and close unity, were not afraid of this at all. On the contrary, they have grown, consolidated, and expanded under the encirclement firepower of the × people and in the continuous sieges of the × people, and have rich experience in countering the sieges of the × people. They had long anticipated the inevitability of such a siege by the × people, and they all had the firm determination to defeat the × people's siege and the confidence to persist in combat and achieve final victory. After two months of arduous anti-siege warfare, they once again shattered the × people's siege plan and achieved a glorious and exemplary victory and many valuable experiences and lessons (to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Guangdong-Guangxi Armies Confront Each Other, Our and × Sides Deploy Fresh Troops for Reinforcement, Sanshui × Fires Across the River to Harass <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Twenty-First Special Dispatch] It is reported that due to ×'s large-scale reinforcements in Guangdong Province, we have dispatched fresh troops from the ×× units and others to advance in various directions, and mobilized various guerrilla units to attack the × army everywhere along the railway lines. Our air force will also assist in the battle at any time. A major battle will begin soon.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Chongqing 21st Dispatch] According to news received here this morning, the Japanese army on the Xijiang River is said to be planning to cross the river near Sanshui again, but was repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army's attempt to invade from Sanshui and join forces with the Japanese army near the Yuehan Railway also failed. The rumors that Japanese warships were concentrated in the Beihai area have been confirmed by official reports. It is said that Japanese warships and Chinese troops on the shore once engaged in a cannon battle, and the plan for Japanese warships to land was temporarily abandoned. According to Chinese military personnel, the Japanese commander may stop activities in the Sanshui area and concentrate his attention on the Central China area. It is reported that the Japanese army plans to invade Yichang along the Han (Kou) Yi (Chang) Highway, and has recently engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. However, the public's sentiment is not settled, and the war on the Pinghan Railway is still at a standstill. Both the Chinese and Japanese sides are reorganizing their positions and replenishing their forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Sihui 21st Dispatch] On the morning of the 18th, × seventy or eighty people, with two steel cannons attached, went to villages near Jitang in Sanshui City to loot food, and were</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Sihui 22nd Dispatch] The × of Sanshui often fires cannons at our positions on the opposite bank to harass them. At 7:00 a.m. on the 21st, they again shelled the Zao Gang area of ​​Old Sanshui across the river from the Mumian area with small steel cannons, firing dozens of shells. Our defending army took advantage of fortifications to cover</p>
<p>Our Army Reinforces Central Hubei, Fierce Battles in Jingshan and Suizhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Military Celebration 22nd Special Dispatch] After the reinforcement of our certain unit in Hubei, the morale was greatly boosted. The × invading Jingshan was blocked and could not advance. Our army in Suizhou launched an attack, raided the ×'s rear, and achieved considerable victories near Maping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xiangyang 22nd Dispatch] The × invading us along the Jingshan Zhongxiang Highway fought fiercely on the Sunqiao side from noon to Shenshi on the 19th. A certain unit of our army outflanked the ×'s side and rear. The × could not hold out and retreated eastward. Our team was sent to pursue them. At 7:00, over a thousand reinforcements arrived and joined the remnants of the × near Qilipao and actively counterattacked us. After our army made a strong resistance in Yuanjiadian Pailou and rushed to reinforce them, a fierce battle lasted all night. The × suffered heavy casualties and are now in a stalemate. The × of Pingba invaded Sanyangdian again on the morning of the 19th. After our valiant counterattack, the × fled back to Pingba in the evening.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Yichang 22nd Dispatch] The × on the Jingzhong Road retreated eastward after our attack. On the late night of the 19th, reinforcements counterattacked us and fought fiercely with our pursuing troops near Liqiao all night.

<p>[Central News Agency Wanjiabu 21st Dispatch] Because the × launched a large-scale siege of our Lu, they expelled all the villagers living at the foot of Mount Lu. The villagers were forced to move to Jiujiang Shahe Xingzi and other areas. Those who did not escape in time were killed by the ×. A part fled to Guling for refuge.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Wanjiabu 21st Dispatch] On the morning of the 21st, the × fired more than 20 shells from the Qiuzhe area to our south bank. The shells all landed in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The Yellow River Has Not Yet Frozen, Jinxi River Affairs Consolidated</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an 22nd Special Dispatch] Because the Yellow River has not yet frozen, the defense is easier in the Jinxi War. The ×'s attempt to cross the river to the west has repeatedly failed. The bulk of the force is now defending the strongholds of Hejin, Linjin, Jishan, Xiangning, and Puxian, with only a small force going west to harass. However, the Tongpu Road's reinforcements are constantly increasing, and they are moving towards various highways. It seems that they still plan to launch a large-scale invasion. We have taken strict precautions.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency Hequ 22nd Dispatch] The × in northern Shanxi have been frequently attacked by our guerrillas, and transportation has been constantly cut off. The stationed × is increasingly terrified.

<p>[Central News Agency Fuzhou 19th Dispatch] Epidemics are prevalent in Fujian Province. This year, from summer to winter, there is no sign of abating, especially malignant malaria. According to a recent investigation, the number of malaria patients in each area of ​​southeastern Fujian accounts for more than 10% to 30% of the total population. For example, in Anxi County, with a population of over 100,000, there are more than 16,000 patients; in Dehua, there are more than 12,000 patients; in Jinjiang, there are 66,000 patients; in Putian, there are more than 56,700 patients. The mortality rate is also very high. The extent of the spread is alarming. Various counties are working hard to prevent malaria, but because the entire territory of Fujian Province is deep in mountains and dense forests, it is difficult to achieve results. Therefore, the number of malaria patients in the entire province this year will reach over one million.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing 20th Special Dispatch] After the Fifth Plenary Session, the changes in the central political institutions were not significant. Xu Shiying's appointment as Vice President of the Executive Yuan seems to have been internally determined. (Editor's note: Mr. Xu is now in Hong Kong. When someone asked him about this, Mr. Xu was still modest.) Zhang Qun was transferred to the position of Secretary-General of the National Political Council, or a vice-speaker will be set up and Zhang transferred to fill it. Chen Lifu plans to resign from one of the two ministries of Education and Social Affairs. The candidate for the successor has not yet been determined. The Central Official Department originally decided on Chu Xin, but Ye still modestly declined. It is planned that Wu Tiecheng will succeed him. Zhang Lisheng of the Organization Department plans to resign, and Luo Meihuan and She Jingtang both have calls for succession.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing 22nd Dispatch] At the Chongqing Senators' Talk Meeting on the 22nd, all agreed that the Central Government had appointed Chairman Chiang to be the Speaker of the National Political Council, and they welcomed it in unison and were extremely excited.

<p>[Haitong News Agency Chongqing 22nd Dispatch] According to the news, there are currently 1,800 motor trucks in Haiphong that have not been able to enter China due to tariff issues. Among these vehicles, there are 600 German-made and 1,200 American-made vehicles. The local French government levies heavy taxes on non-French-made vehicles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Paris 21st Dispatch] Rumors that commercial heavy-duty vehicles and Red Cross ambulances are prohibited by the French government from being transported to China through French Indochina have recently been denied by responsible persons, who said that after Guangzhou City, China, fell in early November last year, the government did indeed temporarily prohibit heavy-duty vehicles from being transported to China through French territory, so as to avoid excessive congestion in the port of Haiphong, but it quickly restored the original state, which has now lasted for more than two months. As for the transport of Red Cross ambulances to China, it has never been subject to any restrictions, and special measures have been taken to facilitate it.</p>
<p>President of Hanoi Chamber of Commerce Speaks Righteously</p>
<p>Vietnam Should Not Discriminate in Transporting Munitions to China Via Vietnam</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing 22nd Dispatch] According to a Paris telegram, the "Order News" reported that Bafurou, President of the Chamber of Commerce of Hanoi City, French Indochina, recently returned to China and expressed his views to the Colonial Committee of the House of Representatives, advocating on the business situation in the Far East, which has caused a profound impression. The members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives have also asked Bafurou to submit a report. Bafurou said that this time he returned to China, he intended to state the common views of Vietnamese merchants and provide information to members of Congress so that they could easily complete their supervisory tasks. In terms of the Far East situation, the Sino-Japanese War has lasted for eight months. Although the two sides have not formally declared war, all important ports in China have been occupied by the Japanese army. In law, there is no state of war between China and Japan, and the third country has no right to maintain neutrality and prohibit private sales of munitions. The Southern Government is still allowing merchants to transport coal and iron ore to Japan, and the reason is that the transport of Vietnamese goods to Japan is considered normal cooperation, so the Vietnamese government should give the same treatment to the transport of goods to China. At a time when British Burma and Yunnan, China, are planning to build a railway, Vietnam should avoid if it insists on its original policy, which is to strangle its own business premise.</p>

<p>[A Report from the People's Revolutionary Society's Frontline Communication] In order to coordinate the capture of Wuhan and consolidate their occupied territories, the enemy mobilized 50,000 troops in late September, based on the four railways of Pinghan, Pingsui, Zhengtai, and Tongpu. They launched a fierce and cruel encirclement and suppression campaign against our model anti-Japanese base area in the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, attempting to "destroy" this model anti-Japanese base area in one fell swoop, in order to realize their cunning plan to "mop up" North China. However, after two months of close unity, courageous struggle, and bitter fighting by the entire military, government, and people of our border region, the enemy suffered heavy losses and repeated defeats. The enemy troops that had entered the border region have been routed one after another, and their plan to mop up the border region has been completely shattered. In order to understand the course of this campaign in the border region and the experiences and lessons learned by our army in this campaign, our reporter went to a certain place on the front line and paid a visit to a certain senior military general of the border region who was responsible for directing this campaign, General So-and-So. The following is a transcript of the conversation:</p>
<p>(1) The Border Region is a Thorn in the Enemy's Throat</p>
<p>From a military point of view, the position of the border region has significant strategic importance. It is located between the four railways of Pinghan, Zhengtai, Pingsui, and Tongpu, with the strategic terrain of the Hengshan and Wutai Mountains, encompassing seven or more prefectures and counties and a population of over ten million. Its existence and development poses a major threat and harm to the enemy, increasing the difficulty of the enemy's offensives to the south or northwest. Therefore, the border region is like a thorn in the enemy's throat. At the same time, under its development and exemplary influence, guerrilla warfare has been widely launched in areas such as Central Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Southern Rehe, and Eastern Chahar, and the work of establishing anti-Japanese base areas is gradually being carried out. This, of course, further expands the threat to the enemy, forcing them to only be able to be trapped along the railway lines and in a few towns. Even the railway lines are constantly being destroyed by us, and the troops traveling back and forth are attacked by us. For example, in Zhangjiakou, Tianjin, and Shanhaiguan, which are in the enemy's rear, we are constantly in a state of war with the enemy, making the Japanese warlords uneasy and the traitors panic-stricken. It is no wonder that Gao Lingwei, the puppet governor of Hebei, lamented that there was "no province to govern." The enemy's military communiqué also put Wutai and Wuhan on par, calling it "north-south coordination to resist Japan."</p>
<p>At the same time, the existence and development of the border region has also generated three major effects:</p>
<p>First, it has won the hearts of the people. We must know that the enemy's attempt to conquer China is not only to seize our territory and eliminate our army, but also to conquer our people's hearts. However, due to the existence and development of the border region, the hearts of the vast compatriots near the war zone and even in the entire North China region have not only not been conquered by the Japanese invaders in the past year, but on the contrary, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the vast compatriots near Tianjin has increased, and the movement to oppose Japan and eliminate traitors has become increasingly widespread. They all hope and believe that our guerrillas will sooner or later come and drive away the Japanese devils.</p>
<p>Second, due to the existence and development of the border region and the widespread expansion of guerrilla warfare, the enemy's goal of plundering the economic resources of North China cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>Third, due to the existence and development of the border region and the development of guerrilla warfare, it is not easy for the enemy to establish puppet organizations and puppet troops. On the contrary, the puppet organizations and puppet troops that have already been organized are constantly being destroyed and disintegrated by us.</p>
<p>It is precisely because the existence and development of the border region has significant meaning and effect in military, political, and economic aspects, and has given the enemy the greatest threat and harm, that the enemy has launched attacks on the border region time and again, attempting to destroy this model anti-Japanese base area and remove this thorn in their throat.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Madame Chiang's Speech in Chongqing: The War of Resistance, National Reconstruction, and Women <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] The Social Hall – Another fervent and grand gathering! The first, unforgettable cry of the "Song of Struggle for Revolution" reverberates in the ears, again and again.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang is giving a speech here today on "The Women's Question in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction," starting at three o'clock.</p>
<p>By 2:45 PM, the female compatriots at Jiaochangkou were packed. Cars and rickshaws couldn't get through. There were large groups of pure-hearted youths and students. If this were a movie, it would have been sold out. The scene was both extremely lively and extremely solemn.</p>
<p>Boy Scouts were on duty, guiding the young students, women, and foreign reporters and guests to their seats in the upstairs hall. They were busy getting everything organized, and everything was in order in less than half an hour. At three o'clock, Madame Chiang, wearing a dark coat and full of spirit, gracefully arrived at the venue. She sat down in the chair on the stage, smiling kindly and greeting everyone.</p>
<p>Over two thousand female compatriots from forty-six organizations were gathered in the hall, riveted by Madame Chiang's grace and beauty, and filled with anticipation. There was no clamor or noise; it was quiet, solemn, and somber. Countless spirits were gathered together.</p>
<p>On the stage were Shen Huilian, Zhang Aizhen, Liu Qingjing, and others, accompanying Madame Chiang on one side. The master of ceremonies quickly announced the opening of the meeting. The national anthem was sung, salutes were offered, the Premier's testament was read, and the fallen soldiers and compatriots were mourned in silence. Then, Zhang Aizhen, the director-general of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee, took the stage to deliver a speech. Following her, Huang Peilan, the head of the committee's life guidance group, reported on the work of the committee, providing a very detailed account of the establishment, organization, and work of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee. After Ms. Huang finished her report, Madame Chiang began her speech amidst warm applause.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang was full of energy. As soon as she stood in front of the stage, everyone became attentive, because they were fortunate enough to hear the leader's instructions. Madame Chiang modestly stated that on the day of the Women's Day Flag Offering by all circles in Jiangba during the February 25th Propaganda Campaign, she did not attend because she was not feeling well. But it wasn't entirely due to her health. She said, "I feel very ashamed, because I have not made any contribution to the country, and I am not worthy of receiving your flag offering, so I did not attend." Then she briefly explained the Guidance Committee, saying that "there are twenty or thirty staff members in the Chongqing branch, but they are not afraid of death and hiding in the rear, nor are they here to escape the disaster. The reason is that the rear is more important than the front! In the rear, it is necessary to mobilize, organize, and cultivate new cadres, and someone has to do it. There are more than one hundred comrades in the Guidance Committee in various places, and they are struggling through all kinds of difficulties, serving the wounded soldiers and refugees on the front line."</p>
<p>"The work in the rear, in Sichuan, has already become a center, and now it should be launched and organized immediately!"</p>
<p>"We have more than two thousand female compatriots here, and it is not enough for everyone to participate in the war of resistance. We must also persuade our relatives and friends to participate together. In the next week, each person must persuade ten people, then we will have twenty thousand people working for the war of resistance! If each of these twenty thousand people persuades ten people, then the general mobilization of women across the country will be realized immediately." Madame Chiang reminded the crowd, saying, "Don't think that you have nothing to do with the country. You are all intellectuals and have received more favorable treatment from the country than ordinary people. Your education is the cultivation of the country, and it is the favorable treatment of the common people. The common people have provided you with their blood, sweat, and oil. You should repay them. Working for the country is working for the common people, which is to increase production, increase national wealth, and strengthen the strength of the war of resistance, which is to liberate the country and the nation."</p>
<p>Madame Chiang also told everyone many shocking things.</p>
<p>"There is a news item in the newspaper today saying that the enemy is forcibly recruiting prostitutes in the occupied areas. Think about it, who are these prostitutes? They are your mothers, sisters, and also my mothers, sisters. Can we tolerate such humiliation?" "The enemy's plot is not only to annex our land and plunder our money, but also to make our compatriots slaves." Madame Chiang shouted indignantly, "Are you willing to be slaves?" Four thousand angry eyes from two thousand people were about to burst into flames. Everyone shouted, "We are not willing!"</p>
<p>"During the battle of Shanghai, we heard reports that the enemy had grabbed our female compatriots, stripped them of their clothes, and tattooed numbers on their shoulders. On the one hand, they made our female compatriots ashamed and unable to escape, and on the other hand, they used them as their [redacted]. This was discovered at the North Railway Station. Also, our young men were dragged away by them and forced to dig graves. After the graves were dug, they were machine-gunned to death and buried themselves. If they were not killed, they were stabbed with bayonets and kicked to bury our young men alive."</p>
<p>"In Nanchang, I saw tens of thousands of women and children suffering hardships on the road to escape. I felt very sad. Who is suffering for these compatriots? It is also the enemy who harmed them." "But the generals, soldiers, and compatriots I have contacted on the front line, although they are very bitter, they can recognize the enemy, and they all unanimously want to resist the war to the end."</p>
<p>Madame Chiang also cited the tragedy of children in the war zone being bled by the enemy, and the fact that farmers were cooked by the enemy. Everyone who heard this was already filled with anger. At this time, Madame Chiang said again that if we want to avoid being slaves and strive for freedom and independence, we can only resolutely resist the war, and only resist the war to the end.</p>
<p>"When I was running a women's war zone service training class in Wuhan, I lived with the students, mopping the floor, wiping the table, and wiping the glass windows. It wasn't to make people maids or good housewives, but to train them to be hardworking and able to go to the front to serve the country. Now that the enemy is so brutal, then I should resist the war, and resistance will definitely lead to the final victory." At this time, Madame Chiang put forward many conditions for our inevitable victory in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>"Li Zongren's old lady is already seventy-six years old. Once I went to see her and expressed my condolences to General Li for fighting on the front line, but she stopped me and replied sternly; this is the duty of a soldier, and he should serve the country. She also smiled and said that China has 200 million female compatriots, and if they can all participate in the war of resistance, even if they use knives, they can drive the enemy back." Madame Chiang also pointed out that sixteen students from women's war zone services died three and injured two after being bombed by enemy planes in Hengshan. One of the seriously injured students recently wrote a letter asking me to assign her work. Her arm was broken, and she said she could do propaganda work. "There are also many heroic women in the war zone who help the army and encourage the army. In the battle of Taierzhuang, many women encouraged the soldiers, and it had a great effect." Then she said firmly, "This spirit is the spirit of the Chinese nation, and this heroic deed is the representative of the Republic of China. We Chinese should all feel honored and should all rise up!"</p>
<p>"Not only that, but our nation's resilience is also very strong. The enemy tries its best to destroy, but as soon as the enemy leaves, our order is quickly restored. Therefore, our war of resistance is indeed very bright." At this time, Madame Chiang also quoted a famous saying from Western philosophers: "Danger creates great people, and comfort creates monsters" to encourage everyone. She said, "The revival of the country must go through a very difficult process." "Only by restoring self-confidence, advancing bravely, will the war of resistance be victorious. Now, women's circles should especially unite and organize; now, the possibility of our country's women serving the country has not yet been fully developed, and if it is fully developed, it will be much stronger than men. We unite for the government, for the entire country, and we must concentrate our efforts under the major premise of the country!" "Now, as long as everyone takes out a part of their time to participate in the war of resistance, to do the work of saving the people and saving the country, we must concentrate our efforts to think about how to strengthen the strength of the war of resistance. No matter who has his strength, he can save the country!"</p>
<p>The more Madame Chiang spoke, the more excited she became, and the applause of the crowd became louder and louder. Finally, she put forward the actual methods for participating in women's mobilization work today and ended her speech with enthusiastic cheers!</p>
<p>The great and enthusiastic grand gathering ended, but the great women's activities in the war of resistance have just begun. Look, the women of Chongqing have roared under the leadership of Madame Chiang!</p>

<h3 id="e15">Strengthening Defensive Power in the Pacific: The US Government Decides to Implement Plans for Expansion of Armaments, Aiding Democratic Countries Such as Britain and France <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations today passed a resolution stipulating that member states should consult with non-member states (i.e., other countries directly related to the Far Eastern situation) to consider the issue of assistance to China. In essence, this means that the actions of member states should be coordinated with the actions of the United States. Informed sources here attach great importance to this, saying that the US, British, and French governments have just sent the same note to Japan regarding the Five-Power Treaty. The Executive Yuan's passage of the above resolution at this time is tantamount to giving prior approval to the actions that the US, British, and French governments may take in the Far East in the future.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Regarding the question of fortifying Guam in the Pacific, President Roosevelt clarified the US government's position in a statement to the press, saying that he also supports the bill proposed by Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, which calls for an appropriation of $5 million to develop a harbor, build barracks, and establish an air base on the island. The projects currently planned will be limited to this extent. Whether defensive fortifications should be built on the island in the future, or whether the status quo should be maintained, will depend on how the world situation evolves. As for negotiations with Japan, the government has not considered them. Political figures have interpreted this statement as further evidence that President Roosevelt is determined to implement the national defense plan in a practical manner. The $5 million is not enough to build genuine defensive fortifications. In addition, the Walsh bill calls for an appropriation of $60 million to build air bases on the islands in the Pacific, from the Hawaiian Islands to Guam. This is also the first batch of funding, and more funds will be added in the future to complete the project. In short, this bill has political significance. The US government has decided to expand its influence in the Pacific on an unprecedented scale. The State Department said that if Japan raises objections to the Guam issue, the US government will only consider listening if the nature of the protest is conducive to the establishment of a new agreement. In short, President Roosevelt stated in his message on January 5 that if the expansionist policies pursued by totalitarian states are to be curbed, a firm attitude must be adopted. In addition to moral condemnation of the methods adopted by these countries, energetic diplomatic, military, and economic means must also be used. The majority of American public opinion agrees with this view. The government has now decided to strengthen the defense line from the Hawaiian Islands to Guam. Many countries in the world share the same interests and the same defensive views as the United States (including Britain and France). The principle should be to actively resist totalitarian states, especially to resist Germany and Japan. Supporting these countries to complete their armament expansion work and exchanging information on scientific research work. Under these circumstances, the question of amending the Neutrality Act will naturally take a back seat. The US government is most concerned with the following two matters: (1) Obtaining congressional approval to quickly begin implementing the armament expansion plan and setting up defenses at new strongholds in the Pacific and Atlantic; (2) Practically studying various methods to assist other democratic countries in accelerating the completion of their armament expansion plans, but without explicitly entering into any kind of agreement.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Senator Gibson, a Republican from Vermont, said that most Republican senators will support the president's naval expansion and Guam fortification plans. The fortification of Guam is of great significance to the Philippines. If the defense of Guam is consolidated, Japan will never be able to launch a large-scale attack on the Philippines, and the United States' influence in the Far East will also be preserved.</p>
<h3 id="e16">The Spanish War Enters an Emergency Stage: The Town of Igualada Has Fallen, Rebels Continue to Attack Barcelona <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Reuter's Dispatch, Paris, 22nd] As the Spanish Rebel army continues to advance towards Barcelona, French newspapers express concern. Mr. Tirard writes in "Le Temps," "The fact that patriots are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the latest developments in the Spanish war is truly regrettable. I believe that Franco's victory in Spain is a disaster for France." "L'Ordre" states, "If Britain and France cannot get the Italian forces to withdraw from Franco's troops, then Mussolini will be able to threaten British and French Mediterranean traffic from the Balearic Islands after the rebels win, and it will be even more impossible to get the Italian forces to withdraw."</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Secretary of State Hull stated that he had received a letter from former Secretary of State Stimson requesting that the order banning the shipment of arms to Spain be lifted. Stimson stated that he had long believed that Spain was a battlefield between dictatorship and democracy. American celebrities had urged him to come forward to uphold justice for the Spanish Republican government, but he had not been able to do so due to his frail health. He had sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull requesting that the order banning the shipment of arms be lifted. Stimson had just joined with American celebrities yesterday to form the Committee to Not Participate in Japan's Aggression.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Dispatch, Salamanca, 20th] In the assault on the town of Igualada, the gateway to Barcelona, fierce fighting between the Spanish rebel army and the government forces raged for over twenty hours. The town has now fallen into the hands of the rebel army. Yesterday, the rebel artillery bombarded the town heavily, and in the evening, the rebel army launched a fierce attack under the cover of tanks. By two or three o'clock this morning, Franco's troops had entered the town.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Dispatch, Salamanca, 21st] The key town of Igualada near Barcelona has been occupied by the rebel army after twenty hours of fierce fighting. The government forces resisted desperately and held out bravely until the last moment. The news of the rebel victory was transmitted here this morning, and the people's hopes for a speedy rebel victory have been heightened again. The first reports stated that the fighting took place very close to the city, and all roads leading into the city were skillfully destroyed by the Asturian engineers. The rebel army's heavy artillery bombarded the city all day long, and the rebel army used flanking maneuvers and ordered a night attack, led by tanks, breaking through the government's defenses like a storm. The government army's defense force was the highly skilled Lister Brigade, so its casualties were extremely high. The rebel army entered the city at two or three o'clock in the morning. After occupying the city, the rebel army immediately occupied the high ground in the northeast. The government army retreated to the village of Franca. On the Mediterranean coast, the rebel army also achieved victories.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Dispatch, Lerida, 21st] The Spanish rebel army has occupied Arbós, 25 miles from Barcelona. Its southern and central detachments are making rapid progress across Catalonia. The northern detachments of Monistrol and Aranjuez are progressing more slowly due to bad weather and thick fog. The rebel mixed force occupied Igualada yesterday and continued to advance this morning, occupying Òdena, three and a half miles northeast of the town. On the southern front, the rebel army has occupied Arbós, which allows Franco to control the entire province of Tarragona. The rebel army has now reached the Foix River.</p>
<p>Spanish Refugees Pour Into France</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Dispatch, Paris, 22nd] Recently, the French government and the press have attached great importance to the problem of the tide of Spanish refugees pouring into France. It is reported that the Spanish Republican government has requested the French government to accept 40,000 civilians crossing the border, but this news has not been confirmed. Political sources say that the Spanish ambassador and the French foreign minister discussed this issue on the 20th. Catalonia is now surrounded on three sides by the Spanish rebel army, and the only way out is to escape across the border into France. It is generally expected that the French government will accept this large group of refugees for humanitarian reasons. According to last night's newspapers, the best way to handle the large group of Spanish refugees is to transport them to the port of Bordeaux on the west coast and then transfer them by ship to Mexico. The Paris Evening News reports that there are currently about 800,000 to 900,000 refugees in Catalonia, in addition to the original residents of the city.</p>
<p>Rebel Aircraft Shot Down</p>
<p>[Reuter's Dispatch, Barcelona, 21st] Today, twenty Spanish government fighter planes engaged five rebel bombers and several fighter planes in the skies over Barcelona. The rebel planes dropped only a few bombs. Several planes crashed during the fighting. Also this morning, a rebel bomber, along with several fighter planes, reconnoitered over the city. Government planes rose to meet them, immediately shooting down one rebel plane.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Barcelona, 22nd] The British ships "Blackburn" and "Dover" were damaged here last night by Spanish rebel planes. The cabin of the "Dover" has been flooded. The "Blackburn," a coal cargo ship, was hit by a shell in the middle.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Long Beach Harbor, California, USA, 21st] Various circles here have recently formed groups to oppose the supply of iron materials to Japan by the United States. As two cargo ships were being loaded with iron materials, more than 3,000 people, mixed with some Chinese expatriates, marched in formation to protest, holding banners with slogans such as "Don't Let Chinese Blood Stain American Hands" and "Thou Shalt Not Kill." The two ships had to stop loading as a result, but no incidents occurred.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] The British Imperial aircraft "Knight" was forced to land approximately 300 miles east of Chincoteague, Norfolk, and is now sinking. The aircraft carried eight passengers and five crew members, consisting of people from the United States, Canada, and Bermuda. The plane was flying from New York to Bermuda, a total distance of 770 miles, which usually takes six hours. However, due to the severe cold along the way, the nose and fuselage iced over, causing all engines to fail. Two American and Canadian destroyers, three speedboats, several merchant ships, and a number of aircraft are rushing to the rescue. Imperial Airways personnel believe that the "Leverpool City" has already reached the crash site of the "Knight," but as it is already dusk, its fate is unknown. The "Knight" is an "Empire" class aircraft of the company, capable of carrying 24 passengers, and is a sister ship to the "Caledonia" and "Cambria."

<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] It is reported that today's German-Czech talks in Berlin will address the issue of Germany establishing a military advisory group in Prague.

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Hitler's meeting with the Czech Foreign Minister last night was entirely private. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, this morning's meeting between the Czech Foreign Minister and the German Foreign Minister was also purely for personal exchange. It is ascertained that during Hitler's meeting with the Czech Foreign Minister, no one else was present besides the German Foreign Minister. Furthermore, according to authoritative sources, issues such as German-Czech customs union, Czechoslovakia's withdrawal from the League of Nations, participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact, and Ukrainian autonomy were not mentioned, as both sides wanted to understand the principles held by their respective governments before engaging in further negotiations. Furthermore, according to opinions within German political circles, there is currently a widespread hope for domestic unity in Czechoslovakia, so that friendly relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia can become closer and the Munich Agreement can be implemented. It is also reported that no political agreement of any kind was established during yesterday's meeting.</p>

<p>—Hitler—</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Hitler recently issued a decree to accelerate Germany's military preparations, stipulating that all men who have completed military service will be formed into a defense force and incorporated into the National Socialist Party's Sturmabteilung (SA). It is claimed that the purpose of this measure is to "maintain their physical and mental strength." All able-bodied men over the age of seventeen must obtain the SA sports badge. The badge is now renamed the "Defense Badge." Therefore, German men must undergo compulsory physical training, part of which will be of a semi-military nature, in order to maintain physical and military standards.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] According to well-informed sources here, the recent resignation of Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the German Reichsbank, is believed to be related to Germany's accelerated military expansion program. According to the foreign correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" here, opinions within the National Socialist Party regarding the financing of the military expansion program are highly divergent. It is reported that Dr. Schacht stated that such a military expansion program could not be carried out using normal financial methods.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Yesterday, well-informed sources told a Reuters reporter that Hitler's adjutant, Wilhelm Brückner, has been appointed Consul General in San Francisco. Various sensational interpretations from outside are unreliable, claiming that this move is not intended to exclude stable elements around Hitler and has no connection with Dr. Schacht's resignation as President of the Reichsbank.</p>

<p>This newspaper’s special dispatch from Kunming on the 22nd reports that Yunnan will allocate all land tax revenue to cover administrative and operational expenses in various counties. At a time when Yunnan's administration is facing difficulties, being able to follow the principles of the Founding Program of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and take the lead in allocating land tax revenue to strengthen local administrative organs and promote production and construction is a model for enlightened authorities in other rear provinces. At this critical juncture in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, all our local authorities, in addition to strictly adhering to the central government's national policies, should strive to meet the essential needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction by adapting to local conditions, provided that it is consistent with the program. Yunnan's move is only one example. However, the implementation of good policies must pay attention to two points: first, those who implement good policies must have the genuine enthusiasm to fight for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, a benevolent and compassionate attitude towards the people, integrity and detachment from material possessions, and sufficient experience and knowledge. Partisan prejudice and empty reputation are particularly to be avoided. Second, the environment for implementing good policies must eliminate passive and conservative, corrupt forces, and actively encourage close cooperation between the party, government, army, and people, especially the promotion of civil governance, which is not only beneficial to the War of Resistance but also a foundation for the success of National Reconstruction.</p>
<h3 id="e26">On the War Situation in South China <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The war in Guangdong Province has intensified in recent days, and a major battle will unfold soon. The main reasons are: on the one hand, the Japanese army is eager to "destroy" the main base and strength of our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, taking advantage of the fact that its allies Germany and Italy are intensifying their harassment of the West and that Britain and France continue to show signs of concession, and is massively reinforcing South China, preparing for a large-scale southwest offensive; on the other hand, our side, since the establishment of the Southwest Military Council, has largely completed all deployments for the second phase of the War of Resistance, with fresh troops advancing step by step, actively preparing for a counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Based on the current situation of the Japanese forces and the reports from our military and political authorities, we are filled with excitement and anticipation for the future of the war in South China. However, there are still two issues hindering the smooth progress of the war that need to be resolved urgently. The first is that the principle of "politics being more important than military affairs and the people being more important than soldiers" has not been effectively implemented. In the future, it is necessary to realize the improvement of political and civil institutions, adjust the relationship between the party, government, army, and people, and unify the youth movement and peasant movement. The second is that in some areas, there is confusion between bandits and guerrillas, harassing the countryside, and in effect acting as advance units for the Japanese army, while many regular guerrillas and patriotic youths and overseas Chinese participating in the movement to go to the countryside to save the nation have been obstructed and tragically killed. Therefore, the unified command and widespread development of guerrilla forces is an urgent need. However, it should be noted here that (1) the barriers to monopolizing the civil movement should be thoroughly removed, and the enthusiasm of the people to assist in the War of Resistance should be unleashed; (2) talents with experience in mobilizing the people should be reused, and progressive and strong young cadres should be carefully cultivated.</p>
<p>The effect of boycotting Japanese goods in Nanyang over the past year Author: Eleanor Dennison Translated by Bao Ren December issue of New York Far Eastern Survey</p>
<p>Since China launched its sacred and heroic War of Resistance, the Chinese people residing in various parts of Nanyang have achieved remarkable results in boycotting Japanese goods. Reviewing the history, whenever China has been subjected to Japanese aggression and oppression, these overseas Chinese in Nanyang have always used the passive method of boycotting Japanese goods to protect their country, causing economic losses to the aggressor. Who dares to say that the Chinese are a backward and unprogressive nation, given this demonstration of national spirit?</p>
<p>In British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Siam, there are a total of seven million Chinese immigrants. Most of the industrial and commercial enterprises are controlled by Chinese merchants. Although they do not have much influence in local politics and culture, they are very concerned about their motherland and often provide great economic and material assistance to their country.</p>
<p>We know that Nanyang is the only important sales market for Japanese exports. In 1937, goods shipped from Japan to Nanyang accounted for 12% of the country's total exports. Before the Sino-Japanese War, because Nanyang was close to Japan and transportation was extremely convenient, the cost was lower. Therefore, most Chinese merchants were willing to sell Japanese goods. Even ordinary immigrants were happy to buy Japanese goods because of their low prices, and unconsciously became promoters of Japanese goods. The reason why Japanese goods were able to sell well in Nanyang was not unrelated to this. Because of the above special circumstances, it is by no means an easy task for Chinese immigrants to economically resist Japan.</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident in July 1937, the people of Nanyang, seeing the Japanese warlords' acts of aggression in China and the tragic scenes of grass-covered graves and bone-strewn hills in the war zones, deeply resented the aggressors' misdeeds. At the same time, Chinese newspapers in Nanyang were doing their best to expose the Japanese army's barbaric actions of aggression, thus arousing the sympathy of most local residents and overseas Chinese. They stood up courageously and automatically organized groups to resist Japan economically. Therefore, the movement to boycott Japanese goods arose like a storm, spreading throughout the region. Even newspapers run by the British and French in Nanyang also vigorously promoted the boycott of Japan.</p>
<p>Because of the great sympathy of foreign nationals and the efforts of Chinese immigrants, the boycott of Japanese goods has been effective. From January to September 1938, Japan's total exports decreased by 40% compared to the same period in 1937, and exports to Nanyang decreased by 54%. Goods shipped from Japan to the Dutch East Indies decreased by 58% compared to 1937, those to the British Straits Settlements decreased by 75%, those to the Philippines decreased by 41%, Siam decreased by 16%, Vietnam decreased by 40%, and British Malaya decreased by 59%. Only Borneo increased by 6% compared to 1937. Among the above regions, the first four places—the Dutch East Indies, the British Straits Settlements, the Philippines, and Siam—are important sales markets for Japanese exports, while the others are less important.</p>
<p>Since Japanese goods imported into Nanyang have been reduced due to the influence of the boycott movement, this will certainly not affect Nanyang's foreign trade. Their foreign imports have increased compared to the past. However, there are also several places where the total foreign imports have also decreased due to the too enthusiastic boycott movement. For example, in British Malaya (including the Straits Settlements), from January to July 1938, its total imports decreased by 16% compared to the same period in 1937, while goods imported from Japan decreased by 74%. In the Philippines, its total imports increased by 36%, while the amount of goods imported from Japan into the Philippines decreased by 20% of the total imports. The people of British Malaya are very enthusiastic about the boycott of Japanese goods. This work has recently become more active. Most stores do not sell Japanese goods, and even the Japanese inventory that was previously stored in the store is not sold. Japanese cotton fabrics, electrical materials, automobiles, machine parts, and canned foods are rarely seen recently. In particular, Japanese-made rubber tires and rubber hoses have almost disappeared from the market.</p>
<p>However, there is one point that I must mention here. Japan's reduction in exports to Nanyang this year is certainly due to the power of the boycott of Japanese goods, but another part of the reason is due to Japan's domestic restrictions on the import of industrial raw materials and the increase in the price of Japanese export goods. According to statistics, the value of Japanese goods shipped to Nanyang countries this year decreased by an average of 20 million Japanese yen per month compared to 1937.</p>
<p>Since Japanese goods have been rejected by Nanyang countries, it will naturally lead to competition from other European powers. For example, in British Malaya, goods imported from Japan in 1938 decreased by 74% compared to last year, while goods imported from European countries increased by 19%. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the commercial trade between the United States and Nanyang was underdeveloped, but last year, due to the boycott of Japanese goods, the United States gained a great deal of profit in trade. Recently, the cars used by the residents of the Dutch East Indies are mostly American-made. Cars manufactured in Japan and Germany are mostly rejected by the people. In British Malaya, Chinese immigrants and local residents are willing to eat American-produced sardines rather than Japanese goods, even though American sardines are more than twice as expensive as Japanese ones.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Xu Shiying Returned to Hong Kong from Chongqing Yesterday, Discussing the Central Government's Plan to Establish a Labor Relief Zone in South China; the Entire Relief Plan Has Been Decided, Hoping Various Organizations Will Cooperate; Over Sixty Hong Kong Organizations Preparing to Establish the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Relief Association for Hometown <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Mr. Xu Shiying, Acting Chairman of the National Government's Relief Commission, flew to Chongqing on official business a few days ago, and returned to Hong Kong by plane from Chongqing yesterday (21st). A reporter visited Mr. Xu yesterday to inquire about the process of this trip and the Central Government's plan for relief work. According to his reply, due to the severe disaster situation in South China a month ago, in addition to allocating funds for emergency relief, he specially requested instructions from the Central Government on the overall relief measures. After arriving in Chongqing, he met Chairman Lin and personally presented everything. Subsequently, he convened a meeting of the Relief Commission in Chongqing, and a decision was made on the plan for relief work in South China, such as establishing a labor relief zone and providing relief through work. However, he still hopes that various charitable organizations will cooperate effectively with the Relief Commission. Regarding Huang Yan's relief efforts, the number of rescued refugees reached 200,000, and they have now been relocated to cultivate land along the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and their lives have gradually become stable, and so on. In addition, regarding the Guangdong Province relief issue, in addition to the concrete plan of our Central Government already being implemented and intensified, various overseas Chinese groups here are also doing their utmost to provide assistance due to their deep feelings for their hometowns. Now, there are more than sixty legal organizations, in view of the lack of contact between the various organizations in the past, affecting work efficiency, who have jointly organized a Guangdong Overseas Chinese Relief Association for Hometowns, with the aim of relieving the war-torn and injured soldiers and refugees in Guangdong Province. All commercial, industrial, academic, and women's groups that agree with the association can join as members through the introduction of members of the association. The association is a liaison mechanism, hoping to trust and rely on each other and cooperate in parallel under the same goal to increase the work efficiency of each organization. The association's organization is divided into two types: (1) a committee jointly organized by the leaders of the organizations that have joined the association, as a deliberative body, and from among the members, select directors for the general affairs, recruitment, training, publicity, and investigation departments, and members of the design committee, to form a task force, as an executive body; (2) each member simultaneously serves as the director of the branch of each affiliated organization, consulting with the association to guide the work of the members of each organization. The association has one chairman, four directors each for the general affairs, recruitment, training, publicity, and investigation departments, a number of staff members, and a number of design committee members, all of whom are honorary positions, and are publicly elected, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Bandits Rob Buses in the New Territories; A Chinese Detective Shot and Seriously Injured; Bus Ticket Seller Robbed of Money Bag; Injured Chinese Detective Immediately Sent to Hospital for Treatment <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Recently, banditry has been rampant in the New Territories, and cases of robbery and murder are frequently seen. Yesterday, another thug armed with a gun robbed the money bag of a Kowloon bus ticket seller, got off the bus and fled. At that time, a Chinese detective was chasing him and was also shot by the thief. The circumstances that occurred at that time are recorded below.</p>
<p>Armed Robbery of Ticket Seller</p>
<p>At 5:45 pm yesterday, Kowloon Motor Bus No. 744, carrying passengers from Yuen Long in the New Territories to Fanling, had a man, about 30 years old, raise his hand at the section of the bus near San Tin, asking the driver to stop. The driver, seeing a passenger boarding, stopped as instructed. Unexpectedly, after the man got on the bus, he immediately revealed his weapon and threatened the ticket seller. After robbing the ticket seller of his money bag, he got off the bus and fled. The ticket seller, unwilling to lose his money, also got off the bus to chase him. However, the ticket seller did not dare to get too close because the thief was holding a gun in his hand, and called out from a distance. When the thief was about to walk to Lok Ma Chau, it happened that Chinese Detective Ma Shu of the Lok Ma Chau Police Station was walking out of a small road, intending to take a bus to Fanling. When he was walking on San Tin Road, Detective Ma suddenly heard someone calling out "thief" ahead. He immediately saw a person walking towards him. The person was holding a money bag in his hand. Therefore, Detective Ma knew that this person was undoubtedly a bandit, so he rushed forward to intercept him.</p>
<p>Shooting of Chinese Detective</p>
<p>However, the thief, fearing arrest, fired a shot at Detective Ma. The bullet entered from the left side of Ma Liang's face and exited from his right ear. After Detective Ma was injured, he fell to the ground. The people around him, seeing this dangerous situation, did not dare to chase after him. Thus, the bandit was able to escape with the loot. After the thief left, the ticket seller and other people helped Detective Ma onto the bus, intending to drive him to the hospital for treatment. Earlier, a Red Cross vehicle, jointly funded by merchants and residents of Shuikou and Wenkeng, had finished delivering supplies donated by the Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee to Shenzhen refugees and was returning. They happened to see this tragedy. Therefore, the people in the bus helped the injured Detective Ma onto the Red Cross vehicle and first sent him to Yuen Long Public Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, Ma Liang was sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment, it is said.</p>

<p>Lin Bosheng, a confidant of Wang Jingwei and the person in charge of the Nanhua Daily, was shot on the evening of the 17th of this month and immediately sent to Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. After the doctors worked hard to treat him, there was no risk of a dramatic change. According to reliable sources, the most significant injuries Lin sustained this time were to his left eye and left nose. Although he has been treated for several days, although there has been some improvement, his left eye is seriously injured, and there is a risk of blindness. His nose injury has also not healed, which is obstructing his breathing. The danger period has not yet passed, and a considerable period of time is required before his condition can stabilize, it is said. Furthermore, it is reported that Wang Jingwei came from Hanoi to visit and comfort Lin after he was injured, it is said.</p>

<p>In recent years, fishermen who have gone out to sea to fish have been frequently subjected to the wanton destruction of Japanese warships and armed fishing boats, the number of cases is too numerous to record. The wives and children of ordinary fishermen rely on fishing for food and clothing. Unfortunately, if they suffer this misfortune, their state of destitution is truly unbearable. The Fishermen's Association is now preparing to hold a flower sale for one day in response to the repeated requests for relief from distressed fishermen. Yesterday, it was submitted to the Hong Kong Secretary for Chinese Affairs and was approved at once, it will be held on the 25th of next month, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Japan's Trade with Hong Kong Plummets, Dropping from Second to Eighth Place, Only Exceeding Three Million Last Year <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Trade between Japan and Hong Kong originally ranked second in Hong Kong's foreign trade, but since Japan launched its invasion of China, its foreign trade has plummeted. Even considering trade with Hong Kong, it has dropped from second to eighth place, ranking behind England, the United States, British India, Germany, Siam, and French Indochina. In 1936 and 1937, Japan's exports to Hong Kong were over 58 million yuan, but last year they fell to 19 million yuan. Japan's imports from Hong Kong were 18 million yuan in 1936 and 20 million yuan in 1937, but last year they were only 3.3 million yuan. Japanese merchants have lost a large portion of their original trade with Hong Kong, suffering significant losses. As Japan's trade with Hong Kong has declined, the United Kingdom has taken its place. At the end of last year, imports reached 56,414,000 yuan, second only to China. In 1937 it was 46.7 million, in 1936 it was 29 million, in 1935 it was 23.9 million, and in 1934 it was 32.5 million. Although Hong Kong's trade was affected by the war in South China last December and trade with South China was reduced, the increase in trade with French Annam and Guangzhou Bay was sufficient to offset the decline.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Inauguration Ceremony of the Hong Kong Banking Industry Amateur Association <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Xinzhi's Encouragement: Abstain from Gambling, Prostitution, and Early Marriage</p>
<p>Speaking of the "banking world," one seems to associate them with a life of "privilege and comfort." If one hears that this "aristocratic" group has also organized and become serious, it might surprise and astonish us, followed by joy and relief.</p>
<p>In fact, under the turbulent tides of the era, unless one is numb and willing to fall behind, who is not awakened from their slumber? The Hong Kong banking world is a tributary in the progressive torrent; it does not require us to be "surprised" or "astonished."</p>
<p>Their name is the Hong Kong Banking Industry Amateur Association, which was established after more than two months of preparation and registration procedures. The inauguration ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM at the Confucius Hall. Their direction, like that of the Hong Kong Amateur Association established 22 days ago, is to improve amateur life, promote wholesome entertainment, and enhance service efficiency, a rather interesting organization. However, the former integrates the professional circles of various industries, while the latter is purely the banking industry.</p>
<p>The association has three types of members: permanent members with 23 people, supporting members with 227 people, and ordinary members with 481 people, totaling 731 people. Permanent members pay a one-time fee of 50 Hong Kong dollars or more, supporting members pay one to ten dollars per month, and ordinary members pay three dimes per month. In addition, there is a fundraising fund, and the economic foundation is quite solid. The association's members belong to banks and bank-affiliated institutions such as the Central Bank, Central Trust Bureau, Central Savings Association, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Agricultural Bank, National Goods Bank, Guangdong Bank, Guangxi Bank, Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau, Shantou Commercial Bank, etc., a total of 46 financial institutions. In terms of organization, there are general affairs, membership, academic, service, sports, and entertainment departments under the Standing Committee to share the association's affairs. Their honorary directors are Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Li Daonan, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and Mr. Huo Baocai.</p>
<p>The meeting yesterday was lively, with guests and hosts showing the fun of group life. After the ceremonial procedures, Chairman Ling Xianyang gave an opening speech. Then, Mr. Qian Xinzhi gave a sincere and insightful speech of encouragement:</p>
<p>"A person should have a career, especially a lifelong career. The banking industry is an emerging and progressive industry because most people commit to it as a lifelong career... To be loyal to the profession, one should abstain from bad habits and promote wholesome entertainment. The organization of the Banking Industry Amateur Association has been promoted in Shanghai, Hankou, and Chongqing. I hope that Hong Kong's will not just hold a meeting and establish the association and then do nothing. It should promote intellectual education and supplement new knowledge. The outdated set is not enough. Whether it is a new economic theory or a new economic doctrine, one must learn them to avoid falling behind. Physical education is very important. When visiting foreign banks, I saw the spirit of their employees standing while working, which our weak Chinese people cannot do. We should strengthen our bodies to be able to do things. As for moral and group education, their importance is also obvious and should be developed equally..." Mr. Qian spoke movingly, and at the end, he sincerely encouraged his colleagues to abstain from gambling, prostitution, and early marriage, and listed many facts of people who enjoyed themselves in the present but ruined their families, making people alert.</p>
<p>Mr. Qian's earnest spirit was like that of a fearful elder, and he said that Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Tang Chunmin could not attend due to matters, and he also represented their intentions. Yesterday's conference had such a speech, which can be considered quite fruitful. Surely many people will be inspired from their shame. Reporting on the preparation process, awarding prizes, discussing, electing, one scene after another passed by, interesting, powerful, and the enthusiastic cheers made the whole place excited and tense. The program included amateur singing, Cantonese opera, harmonica, and magic from the Amateur Association. The drama had two plays from the amateur theater group, "Song of the Night" and "Black Shadow", and playwrights Cai Chusheng and Situ Huimin were invited to attend, with excellent results. The Commercial Press choir also participated in the singing, which was truly a grand occasion. The children's cheers at the magic show were especially interesting. The general situation was largely the same as when the Amateur Association was established earlier. The reporter's excited mood in writing this special report is also similar to the one written on New Year's Day about the Amateur Association.</p>
<p>Come on: Following the Amateur Association and the Banking Industry Amateur Association, let employees of all industries move from individual to collective, from debauchery to seriousness!</p>
<h3 id="e35">As Poisonous as Snakes and Scorpions: Gangster Women in Refugee Areas Induce Refugees to Sell Young Girls, Force Them to Sell Their Children to Repay Debts After Lending Money, Activities Located in Kowloon Area <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities, in view of the proliferation of private prostitutes, many of whom are underage girls, which not only harms public morals but also violates humanity, have been cracking down on them extensively. Many cases have been uncovered in recent days, and severe penalties have been imposed on gangsters who induce and oppress ignorant girls to sell their bodies, devoid of all conscience. It has been found that these gangsters who abduct women use vicious methods. In addition to coercion and inducement, they have recently invented a new trick, actively operating among the refugee population. They investigate refugees who have young girls and then take the opportunity to express intimacy with them. Since they are refugees, they may be short of money, so they pretend to be generous and lend them money, causing the beneficiaries to be moved to tears and fall into their trap, unaware of what is happening. After a considerable period, they then demand repayment. If they fail to do so, they are threatened. The deceived are then forced into a corner and persuaded to sell their children to pay off the debts, and the gangsters' plan is successful. It has been found that these gangsters are mostly middle-aged women who appear kind but have hearts like snakes and scorpions. Their activities mostly take place in the areas where refugees gather, such as Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and Sham Shui Po. The authorities are now strictly investigating these gangsters.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Chinese Tea is Heavily Promoted in the Soviet Union, Soviet Union Sends Special Ships to Hong Kong to Transport Tea, Ship "Feilisi" Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday from the Black Sea, Annual Sales of Chinese Tea in the Soviet Union Reached Nine Million <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Soviet ships rarely appeared in Hong Kong waters in the past. Recently, the ship "Feilisi" arrived in Hong Kong from Odessa in the Black Sea, arousing the attention of the general public. Some even rumored that it was carrying military supplies to China. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited the ship owner yesterday. According to him, this is absolutely not the case. The ship has not been carrying any cargo recently. The ship's shallow draft is clear evidence of this. Moreover, the ship is not the first Russian ship to come to Hong Kong. Three weeks ago, one had already arrived in Hong Kong. The mission of these two ships is to transport Chinese tea promoted in Russia. It has been found that last year, the total value of Chinese tea exported from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union reached as much as nine million, especially at the end of last year, this trade was particularly prosperous. In the future, the ship may regularly travel between Hong Kong and Odessa with many other Russian ships. If so, novel commercial ships with an axe and sickle painted on the smokestack will appear on the waters of Hong Kong from time to time. Hosted by Ms. Jinmen</p>

<p>Mr. Tao paused again after speaking to this point. However, neither the speaker nor the listeners showed any signs of fatigue. Mr. Tao continued, "However, I am not against running education in the rear area at the same time. Just don't use the old eight-legged essay or the foreign eight-legged essay. We must eliminate secondary courses and add courses that meet the needs of the anti-Japanese war. There is a very important principle that should be followed: that the organization and training in the rear area should be coordinated with the needs of the front line. I remember once meeting the dean of a medical school, and I urged him to quickly train medical personnel to contribute to the anti-Japanese war. The dean said proudly, 'Old Xun: Medicine is not like other things! To be able to serve, it always takes at least five years, and it cannot be sloppy.' My reply at the time was: 'Now the most soldiers die from malaria, dysentery, and unstoppable bleeding. Does it take five years to train specialists to treat these diseases?' 'Well, if it's to train such personnel, it doesn't take that long.' 'That's right! Please quickly train a large number of such personnel to treat our front-line soldiers and save our brave soldiers. As for training people to dissect and remove bullets, I don't object to your five years of training.' The organization and training in the rear area must be coordinated with the needs of the front line, and this is a concrete example.</p>
<p>Recalling a few months ago, before Guangzhou was occupied, a friend from Sun Yat-sen University asked me: Do you think Sun Yat-sen University should move? My answer was: 'Quickly move! Quickly move! Quickly move!' The reason is: Instruments cost money to buy; training a university student is not easy either. Unfortunately, they didn't move, and they suffered a great loss when Guangzhou fell.</p>
<p>Recently, I met this old friend again in Guangxi, and he asked me again: Do you think Zhongda should move from Guangxi to Yunnan again? My answer is: Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! The reason is that Yunnan is too far from Guangdong. In Guangxi, you can still participate in the work of defending Guangdong. Using the relocation fee to build air-raid shelters is more than enough. The second reason is that there are too many universities in Yunnan, and there is really no need to add another one.</p>
<p>But I am not mechanically opposed to running education in Yunnan. If there are not too many institutions of higher learning there, and they are determined to transfer their strength to the front line, then no one will object.</p>
<p>Therefore, running education in the rear area is not to hide lazily under the shield of a century-long plan. We must always consider the needs of the anti-Japanese war, that is, the needs of national construction. If the anti-Japanese war fails, everything is over, and the so-called century-long plan becomes a plan for slaves. So the most important thing in running education in the rear area is to increase the strength of the anti-Japanese war. Otherwise, hiding in a cave and still running education for education is an escape from education.</p>
<p>When Mr. Tao spoke to this point, the listeners were deeply moved again. Mr. Tao said enthusiastically:</p>
<p>'Our own education was one-sided in the past, and now it should be comprehensive. Comprehensive self-education means: seeing, thinking, playing, talking, and doing. Of course, we have two eyes; we must see; we have a brain; we must think; we have a mouth; we must talk; we are tired; we must play; we have hands; we must do. We have to see for the sake of doing, think for the sake of doing, talk for the sake of doing, and play for the sake of doing. Doing is the center of life, that is, the center of education. What to do? Anti-Japanese war and national construction!</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese war and national construction require:</p>
<p>Real doing, not fake doing;</p>
<p>Poor doing, not wasteful doing;</p>
<p>Joint doing, not divisive doing;</p>
<p>Fast doing, not slow doing;</p>
<p>Big doing, not small doing.</p>
<p>All fake doing, wasteful doing, divisive doing, slow doing, or small doing are suspicious. We should pursue evidence, distinguish between traitors and mediocrities, and give them appropriate treatment. Education is effective only through life; anti-Japanese war education is effective only through anti-Japanese war life.</p>
<p>Education is a weapon of national liberation and a weapon of human liberation. It is not enough to be called comprehensive education if it is not extended to the entire nation and all of humanity.'"</p>
<p>Warm applause ended this tense, serious, lively, and interesting lecture. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Travelogue of Tai Po <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Tai</p>
<p>One summer morning, the sky in the east had just turned the color of a fish's belly. Our group of five set off from Mong Kok along Nathan Road towards Tai Po Road. At this time, the sun had not yet risen, and the dark distant mountains were still shrouded in milky white mist because they were not exposed to sunlight. The weather was gloomy and dim. We walked for half an hour and arrived at Shek Shui Pei, where we took the opportunity to visit the reservoir. There are eight reservoirs, with high yellow mud mountains surrounding the four sides of the reservoir, creating a depression. Tall and dense pine trees are planted on the top of the high mountains. Water flows out of a large iron pipe on the left side of the low mountain, leading to the reservoir, impacting the stone steps, splashing white waves, and making a splashing sound, like playing a beautiful melody of music. Going in from the path on the right, there is a cave, about dozens of feet deep. Looking inside from the entrance of the cave, only the two ends of the cave are slightly bright, while the middle is gloomy. We walked through the cave, and the ground was very damp. When we reached the center of the cave, the air gradually became thin, and we felt short of breath. After this, we reached a flat green meadow. We rested here for a while and then walked towards the mountain road. The mountain road gradually became higher and higher, and rugged rocks protruded from the mountain road like sword peaks. Thorns were all over the road, making it difficult to walk. We carried our belongings on our backs and walked forward without any difficulty, with a spirit no less than that of soldiers on an expedition. We went down the mountain along the path around the top of the mountain and turned onto the wide road. At this time, the sun had already risen to the top of the high mountain, and the weather gradually became hot. Everyone seemed to feel a little tired, but they continued to move forward. Walking and walking, we unconsciously arrived at Sha Tin Station. Hearing that there was another scenic spot not far from here—Che Kung Temple—everyone discussed going there to play. So, guided by the locals, we walked along the small path around the fields, and it took us half an hour to reach our destination. The temple was built at the foot of the mountain, facing a rice field with newly transplanted seedlings. Green trees were planted on both sides of the temple, and the scenery was quiet and secluded. Guided by the temple's abbot, Zhilin, we visited the Buddha's throne. The inside was decorated very elegantly. Incense burners were burning pagoda incense, emitting a clear and fragrant aroma, which further highlighted the temple's purity. Being there felt like transcending the chaotic world. The worries and sorrows of the body and mind were washed away a lot. After playing for a while, it was already twelve o'clock. We had lunch in the temple. The vegetarian dishes were delicious and had a special flavor.</p>
<p>We stayed here for more than an hour and then set off again. Because everyone wanted to travel to Tai Po, they went along the railway track. After walking for two hours and passing through several tunnels, their faces were red, their ears were hot, and they were sweating profusely. However, the expected destination was still out of sight. At this time, everyone seemed to be anxious, but the more anxious they were, the farther the journey seemed to be. Later, they finally reached their destination—Tai Po. Everyone unloaded their burdens, found some tea in Tai Po Station to quench their thirst, rested for a moment, and went to stroll around Tai Po Market. The streets in the market are narrow and the roads are paved with mountain stones, which are uneven. There are dozens of shops of all kinds, but business is not very prosperous. Because the traffic between Kowloon and Tai Po is convenient, and the cost of travel is not high (round-trip tickets are only three dimes and a half), most residents buy their daily necessities in Hong Kong, so there are few large stores in Tai Po. The market is backed by mountains and faces the sea, and the scenery is quite beautiful. Families of military and political dignitaries who have taken refuge in Hong Kong mostly build houses on the mountains. There is a narrow mountain road from the market to the mountains, and they do not feel bitter in traveling back and forth. We stayed overnight in the chapel on the top of the mountain that night. Everyone ate two dumplings as their meal. The pastor of the chapel gave us the downstairs of the church to sleep. Everyone spread out their blankets and lay down, looking like skeletons on a tomb. Everyone spent the night in a daze. The next morning at three o'clock, we set off from Tai Po to Yuen Long.</p>
<p>Lianzhou, the Frontline of National Defense</p>
<h3 id="e41">Shipping News <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The French mail ship "非力士 蘇号", originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong yesterday and depart in the afternoon, will be delayed until tomorrow morning (24th) before arriving, according to the company's message last night, and will depart in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The "言路化沃号", managed by Jardine Matheson, brought more than 2,000 tons of goods from the United States. It is expected to be completely unloaded this morning and then enter the Taikoo Dockyard for repairs.</p>
<p>The Russian ship "打比利士号", arrived in Hong Kong from Vladivostok on the morning of the 20th and berthed at Kowloon Wharf. It is expected to stay for several days to load European goods, which are said to be about 8,000 tons, with minerals, tea, and wood oil being the largest items.</p>
<p>The "交通号" of Taisheng Company has been in the dock for many days. The repairs are progressing quickly and are expected to be completed. It is scheduled to leave the dock on the morning of the 25th and continue its voyage between Hong Kong and Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Travels in Chaoshan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of full-scale war, "Chaoshan" has stood on the front line of Guangdong's defense, its importance being more than ten times greater than in peacetime. The term "Chaoshan" encompasses Shantou, Chao'an, Chaoyang, Chenghai, Puning, Jieyang, Raoping, and Huilai—eight counties and cities. Shantou, in particular, is the central hub of all Chaoshan, the crucial gateway for those going abroad, and the center of industry and commerce. In recent decades, Shantou has transformed into a modern city with the turning wheels of time. For this trip to "Chaoshan," Shantou was both the starting point and the return line for the reporter’s itinerary. Therefore, in this travelogue, Shantou must also serve as the vanguard of the pen.</p>
<p>Opening a map, one can immediately see the importance of Shantou's location. Although ships of ten thousand tons cannot enter Shantou's harbor—Ma Islet—ships sailing on the Nanyang and Beiyang routes can directly reach the rocky mountain and the Chao Customs. The rocky mountain is the only place to escape the summer heat in Shantou. Many foreigners and consulate officials reside on the mountainside. Moreover, the consulates of various countries in Shantou are also located here, so many people call the area the second Gulangyu. However, this place is an integral part of our country's territory, and foreigners have no administrative power whatsoever. Speaking of Shantou's transportation, it can be said to be complete in sea, land, and air. However, since the outbreak of the war, there have been no airplanes for air travel. Land transportation continues to develop. From Shantou to Chao'an, there is the Chaoshan Railway and the dike highway. To Chenghai, there is the Shanzhang Highway and a light rail. Besides electric boats, Chaoyang also has provincial buses for transportation. To Huilai and Puning, provincial buses also provide direct access. As for overseas routes to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Siam, and Annam, there are more than a dozen shipping companies operated by foreigners. Therefore, the sea in Shantou's harbor is often filled with many boats. The roads in Shantou's urban area have been well developed. The asphalt roads are soft and resilient. Especially Waima Road is a model for the entire city. The small park in the city center is bustling with traffic day and night. Zhongshan Park, spanning ten thousand mu, is the largest in eastern Guangdong. The park is gradually being completed with artificial hills, pavilions, a zoo, and flowerbeds. In the summer, rowboats on the lake are as numerous as carps crossing the river. The scenery of the entire park is also very spectacular. However, after Japanese planes bombed Shantou several times, the number of tourists sharply decreased, and part of the park was designated as a restricted area. This situation—half locked up and half open—is vastly different from the past. According to the Chaozhou Prefecture Chronicle, Shantou originally belonged to Chenghai and was initially named Shashantou because two hundred years ago, Shantou was just a sandy land protruding from the sea. Now, the term "Jiangxia" is also used. This time, the reporter took a train from Shantou to Chao'an. After about two hours, the train arrived at the county seat. After a short visit to the county seat, I took a rickshaw to the Xiangzi Bridge and the West Lake area for a stroll. This ancient city is where Han Yu served as a magistrate to govern the people. Even now, the cultural level is still very high. Xiangzi Bridge is a bridge named after Han Xiangzi, from the saying "Nine times Wen Gong, ten times his wife." The bridge is made up of eighteen boats linked together. At the head of the bridge stands a unique iron ox, but it is not known from which dynasty it originated. There is a Chaozhou folk song that says, "Eighteen boats connect twenty-four continents, two iron oxen, one slipped away." It is said that the iron oxen were originally a male-female pair. Several years ago, the female iron ox was suddenly stolen. However, it is now impossible to verify whether this event actually occurred. There are seventeen or eighteen shops on the Huzi Bridge. Unfortunately, in July, Japanese planes dropped several bombs at the head of the bridge, causing significant damage. The Han Wengong Temple is also nearby and is very popular. The people of Chaozhou are deeply superstitious about gods and Buddhism. All the statues in the city were gathered in the Chenghuang Temple by the county government last year. Northwest of the county seat is the Kaiyuan Temple, a famous ancient temple in Chaoshan. The architecture is very grand. Because the reporter came and went in a hurry, Chao'an could only be a fleeting visit. That same day, I took a connecting bus to Jieyang. Chaozhou was originally named Chaozhou. After the Republic of China, it was renamed Chao'an and has the beautiful name of Fengcheng. The reporter arrived in Jieyang in the twilight. After staying overnight, I went to see the Jieyang Sugar Factory, which had been bombed by Japanese planes, but all I saw was a pile of ruins. Returning, I made a tour of Jieyang City. The city's appearance and construction are a bit more backward than Chao'an. Banyan trees are planted everywhere in the city, so Jieyang is also known as Rongcheng. At dawn on the third day, I took a Shantou-Jieyang boat to Guantou. Without stopping in Guanbu, I hired a sedan chair to Chaoyang. It was noon when I arrived in Chaoyang. A tall stone tower could be seen from afar, named Wenguang Pagoda. The speech of the people of Chaoyang sounds coarser than that of other counties, so there is a saying that compares the people of Chaoyang, saying, "I would rather quarrel with the people of Chao'an than talk to the people of Chaoyang." Perhaps it is because the Chaozhou dialect is difficult to understand. The scenic spots in the northern suburbs of Chaoyang include Beidang and Xiaobeidang Peaks. There are temples on the peaks, and the vegetarian cuisine of Xiaobeidang is famous in Chaoshan. The monks in the temple serve as chefs, and tourists who arrive here must enjoy it to the fullest. The reporter also spent two yuan to eat four vegetarian dishes, which were indeed light and delicious, living up to its reputation. It is said that the oil used for cooking is buried underground for three years before being used, so it is different from ordinary bean oil. Standing on the peak, Xidang, which is facing it, is also visible in the distance. The scenery is secluded and clear, with a very detached atmosphere. It is said that there is a Lianhua Peak twenty miles away from Chaoyang, with a stone chamber under the peak. Looking through the cracks in the stone, one can see strange omens. Those who are able are also driven by curiosity. I immediately took the Chao-Hai Highway bus to go there. Upon reaching the destination, I rushed to see the stone chamber. Who knew that things would turn out contrary to expectations, almost to the point of coming with excitement and returning in disappointment. It turned out that Japanese warships were spying on the Chaoshan coast, and Japanese warships were shelling Haimen from time to time. Due to the emergency of the defense, people were forbidden to travel to the Lianhua area. The reporter did not take this into account when he came, but luckily I was specially allowed to see the stone chamber. However, looking at it again and again, there was nothing at all, nothing like the so-called Buddha appearing, it was really unfounded deception. Due to the itinerary, the reporter returned to Chaoyang and took a car to Leikou, and then transferred to Dahu. Dahu belongs to the second district of Chaoyang. Most of the residents make a living by fishing, but because Japanese warships burn and kill fishing boats, most people dare not go to sea to fish. The lives of the fishermen are extremely difficult now. There are three fish markets in the Da region, which are now managed by the government. After a brief stay in Dahu, the reporter rushed back to Shantou to go to Chenghai and Raoping counties. Therefore, in the afternoon, I took the Shantou-Da boat to Shantou, rested overnight, and the next day took the Shantou-Zhang Highway bus to Chenghai. Without stopping along the way, upon arriving in Chenghai, I was led by a friend, Li Wei, and walked around the city. As a result, I ran to a restaurant and tried Chenghai's famous ten-produced silver and pork head meat. The only gains from this trip to Chenghai were these two foods. I originally wanted to visit Puning and Huilai, but after a week of traveling, the journey was tiring, and my body was extremely exhausted, so the original plan had to be temporarily postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Guangxi Province Highways and Scenery Along the Lines (2) <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Taifeng</p>
<p>B. Centered on Liuzhou</p>
<p>Liuzhou is located in the middle of Guangxi. Waterways crisscross, giving it the natural ability to control the entire province. In the past, the Liujiang River gathered produce from nearby areas, flowed westward, and passed through Wuzhou to Guangdong and Hong Kong. Therefore, trade was always prosperous. Now, the highways are smooth, connecting to Guizhou and Chongqing in the north, reaching Guilin and Hezhou in the west, and running through Yong and Long in the south to connect with eastern Guangdong. Since the outbreak of the war, all the coastal provinces have wanted to enter the interior, and most of them have passed through here. Merchants have gathered, making it extremely prosperous for a time. Liuzhou is also known as Maping because the Liujiang River comes from Shilong, encircles the east, west, and south sides of the city, and curves like a horseshoe. During the Tang Dynasty, Liu Zongyuan was demoted to this place. The Liu Hou Temple in Liuzhou Park in the east of the city is dedicated to Liu Zihou. Behind the temple is also a tomb with clothes and hats to commemorate him. Liyu Mountain is located in the southwest corner of the city. Its shape resembles a fish standing upright, just as its name suggests. There is a Fourth Army Pavilion on the mountainside, which commemorates the Fourth Army. Lei Mountain is ten miles south of the city, and there is a deep pool below, called the Datan Pool. Many famous Tang and Song Dynasty figures have composed poems and songs at the foot of the mountain. Longbi Mountain is thirty miles to the north. The stone wall is winding like a dragon, quite magnificent. The main product is tung oil, which generates profits of five million yuan annually. There is also a lot of timber, mostly fir, which is especially sturdy for making coffins, hence the saying "Die in Liuzhou." In recent years, new factories have been built, including a machinery factory, an alcohol factory (now closed), and an agricultural and forestry experiment station.</p>
<p>There are six highways starting from Liuzhou: Guiliu, Liuyu, Liuyi, Liuliu, Liwei, and Liushi.</p>
<p>1.  The Guiliu Line is 242 kilometers long. From Guilin to Lipu is 104 kilometers, sharing the same route as the Guiyue Line. From Lipu to Liuzhou is 138 kilometers, passing through Xiuren, Sanjiang, Toutang, Sipa, Rongjiang, Luzhai, and Chirong, seven stations. It was built between 1927 and 1928. The terrain along the line is undulating, making the engineering quite challenging. Since Sanjiang, the highway runs along the mountain valley, commonly known as the Nine Bends and Thirteen Turns, which is especially dangerous. The counties along the line produce tung oil, tea, and so on. The straw mushrooms of Liujiang are particularly famous. Cantonese merchants have established trading posts here to collect and process them into canned goods, which are shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>2.  The Liuyu Line runs south from Liuzhou for 124 kilometers to Binyang, then turns east for another 136 kilometers to Yulin. Both sections have gravel road surfaces, passing through Labao, Ducun, Liudao, Sandu, Ligao, Datang, Silian, Beisi, Heli, Qianjiang, Shiling, Zouxu, Binyang, Qingtang, Leishen, Huanglian, Qiantang, Guixian, Luobowan, Batang, Santang, Qiaoxu, Zhanjiang, Pengtang, Shanxin, Shangmingshui, Xingye, Lidi, Gaopo, Ya, Sanshan, Gulouping, and Fengmentang, thirty-three stations. It is divided into three sections. The Liubin section started construction in October 1926 and opened to traffic in May 1927. The roadbed projects include Jiamaling, Shijiao, and Beisishan. The largest bridge projects are Longjiang Bridge and Lema Bridge. The Bingui section, from Qiantang to Guixian, was built by the Guican Steamship Company in 1925. The Binleishen section was built by the Bingui Highway Bureau in 1928. The Guiyu section was funded and built by local gentry and people along the line in 1925 and completed in 1926 and opened to traffic in January 1927. The entire section has a flat road surface, and the earthwork filling and cutting are well done. Many of the bridges utilize existing stone bridges, which are quite sturdy.</p>
<p>This line connects to the Wuyu Line in the east and the Yushi Line in the south. It is not only a major artery of the province's highways but also a conduit from Hong Kong to the southwest. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the number of vehicles has converged, making it even more important than other lines. Unfortunately, due to the recent tension in Beihai, travel is restricted.</p>
<p>Datang is located on the south side of Fenghuang Mountain, 59 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou. The highway comes from the north of Binyang and branches from here, heading northeast to Liuzhou and northwest via Hechi and Liuzhai to Guizhou. The area is scattered with stone peaks, resembling candles, pagodas, and bull horns, with different shapes, all vividly lifelike. Looking out from the bus, it is enough to be dazzling.</p>
<p>Beisi is 39 kilometers south of Datang and produces coal, which is currently mined by the Heshan Coal Mine Company.</p>
<p>Qianjiang is 24 kilometers south of Beisi, 122 kilometers from Liuzhou. It is located on the west bank of the Panjiang River, also known as the Hongshui River, named for its vermilion water color. On the east bank are Dayin Mountain and Xiaoyin Mountain, shaped like seals, just as their names suggest. There are coal mines nearby, with reserves of 20 million tons.</p>
<p>Binyang is 47 kilometers south of Qianjiang, 129 kilometers from Liuzhou. The highway comes from Liu and divides into two roads, one eastward to Yulin for the Liuyu Line, and the other southwest to Yongning for the Yongliu Line. The local handicraft industry is very prosperous and highly imitative, earning it the nickname "Little Japan." Nearby villages each have special products, such as the lamp wicks of Fangcun Village, the paper fans of Shikan Village, the daily necessities of Sucun Village, and the rain hats of Dazhuang Village, etc. The production of porcelain is particularly famous, with an annual output of over 200,000 yuan. The provincial government has established the Binyang Porcelain Factory to improve it. Nearby is the Cangqian Mine, with reserves of 16 million tons. To the southwest is Kunlun Pass, where Di Qing of the Song Dynasty defeated Nong Zhigao, a historical site.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Today's Wuxi Industry <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Hua</p>
<p>Large Factories Prefer to Rely on Others, Small Silk Factories Can Be Self-Reliant</p>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Wuxi, one of China's four major rice markets and an important town on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, can be said to have the most developed industry in the province. Before the war, there were nine textile factories, more than fifty silk factories, four flour mills, and over a hundred rice shops. Since its fall to the enemy more than a year ago, Wuxi has been filled with a murky atmosphere, the black hands of devils. All industries have suffered unprecedented catastrophe. The major factories have all been monopolized by the Japanese, and even small businesses are controlled by them. Disguised distribution-style Huazhong Silk Company, Daji Foreign Firm, Daxing Foreign Firm, etc., are grabbing Wuxi's industrial throat, not letting it breathe. The author will only report on its current situation—Wuxi's industry. Any omissions are unavoidable.</p>
<p>(1) Textile Industry</p>
<p>Before the war, there were seven factories including Shenxin, Zhenxin, Lixin, Guangqin, Qingqin, Qingfeng, and Yikang. Among them, Qingfeng and Shenxin factories had the largest scale, and Lixin Factory had the most output. Most of the factory buildings were destroyed, and many of the internal machines were also damaged. The Shenxin and Zhenxin factories were repaired by personnel sent by the Japanese Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd. The Yikang Yarn Factory was repaired by personnel sent by the Shanghai Dakang Yarn Factory. The Weixin and Xiexin factories were established in mid-October of last year. Although they started work once when the new cotton was launched, there were not many transactions.</p>
<p>(2) Flour Mills</p>
<p>The losses of the flour mills are much lighter than those of the yarn industry. The heaviest losses were the Fuxin and Maoxin factories. Guangfeng Flour Mill has already started work, and Jiuda is preparing. Of course, this kind of opening up still exposes the miserable situation, relying on the Japanese.</p>
<p>(3) Silk Factories</p>
<p>The silk industry, which holds the leading position in Wuxi's industry, is of course the most important. In the prosperous era of the silk industry, there were more than fifty silk factories, more than 13,000 silk reeling machines, and more than 60,000 workers. Now, the total number of silk reeling machines is less than a fraction of what it used to be. Its industrial situation can be seen. However, the Japanese believe that there are profits to be made and are unwilling to relax. They specially organized the "Huazhong Silk Company" to control it. Currently, the Zhenyi, Zhenyuan, Dasheng, Dingchang, Hongyu, Fulun, Qingkang, Hefa, and Dingsheng are reopened.</p>
<p>The so-called "Huazhong Silk Company" is really dark. The registered capital is nominally 8 million yuan, but in reality, it is probably worthless. Outsiders cannot know the details. The Japanese take 60% of the profits, and the Chinese take 40%. The purpose of the "Huazhong Company" is to control the silk industry in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zones. The general office is located in Hongkou, Shanghai, and branch offices are located in Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. The "Wuxi Huazhong Silk Company" is located in Maozi Bridge in the city. Its organization is led by a Japanese general manager. Below the general manager, supervisors from each factory are also Japanese. The factory directors of each factory are Japanese, and the deputy factory directors are Chinese. It is divided into three departments: sorting, engineering, and affairs. The affairs of each department are as follows: (1) Sorting Department: opening workshop, sorting silk, inspection room; (2) Engineering Department: cocoon selection room, cocoon boiling room, silk reeling room, workshop, warehouse, waste silk room, power room, repair room; (3) Affairs Department: accounting, payroll, general affairs, miscellaneous affairs. Here is a list of the contents of the two silk factories that have reopened.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Li Huitang Leads Effectively; Chinese Team Defeats Maritime Hegemon; All Troops Strive; Battle Tense; Eleven Team Members Injured Over Half; Navy's Strength High but Forwards' Shots Lack Assurance <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] In an important football match, a team composed of mostly second-rate players was able to defeat a formidable opponent through the dedication of all its members and effective leadership.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese team was able to defeat the Navy in the Li Hua Cup, precisely because, as mentioned above, all eleven members of the team spared no effort. It was especially commendable that they achieved victory in the second half when more than half of the team members were injured.</p>
<p>All eleven members of the Chinese team deserve credit, but the most significant contributions came from Li Huitang in the forward line, Liang Rongzhao as the forward leader, and Tan Jun'gan in the defense. These three heroes are truly figures worthy of recognition.</p>
<p>With Huitang orchestrating the attack in the forward line, he remains calm unless he strikes like a river, and his reputation and amazing shooting skills require several defenders to restrain him wherever he goes. Even the goalkeeper Dixon, who likes to attack, is often held back by Huitang and dare not venture out easily. Although Huitang's performance was less outstanding, his success in restraining the enemy cannot be denied, and his teammates should forgive him for playing injured this time as he was doing his best, and he injured his waist before half-time, which considerably affected his performance.</p>
<p>The four goals scored were mainly due to flank attacks. As for Huitang's anchor-shaped attacks, they were too closely guarded to be easily executed. However, he contributed directly and indirectly to the victory, which shows that his tactics were effective.</p>
<p>Rongzhao advanced and retreated with purpose, demonstrating a powerful presence. He showed his true skill in midfield, especially after Xu Jingcheng was injured, when he had to take on more responsibilities, covering both interceptions and attacks, which was truly commendable.</p>
<p>Jun'gan showcased his defensive expertise, guarding the goal with many fine saves. Especially in the last twenty minutes, when the enemy attacked relentlessly, he used his skillful hands to avert danger. If the Navy had scored a goal at that time, the outcome of the game might have been different, making Jun'gan's contribution paramount.</p>
<p>Defenders Hou Rongsheng and Luo Weiquan lived up to expectations. Rongsheng's playing style was brave and agile, with commendable tackling and kicking skills, but his close-marking skills were not yet fully developed. Weiquan still played in the style of an old-fashioned halfback, but he was steady and reliable. However, because it was the first time he paired with Rongsheng, they sometimes overlapped in position.</p>
<p>Cheng He was injured at the end of the first half, but he continued to play with reduced mobility. However, he still managed to restrain Armstrong, preventing him from succeeding, which was a significant contribution. Zeng Zhongyun struggled against the formidable Kentish, but he persevered throughout, which was commendable.</p>
<p>Forward Zou Wenzhi carried the ball forward skillfully, and he and Hou Chengtou cooperated well. Zhuo Shijin was brave and performed well, while Chen Bingtou had many opportunities to move around, thanks to Shijin's passes, resulting in effective flank attacks.</p>
<p>The Navy's defeat was not due to inferior skills; in fact, their coordination was slightly better than the Chinese team's. However, their forwards lacked assurance in shooting, so they failed to score. Among the Navy's eleven players, Dixon performed the best, and Han Weilu was also good. The Navy had the upper hand in the midfield scramble, and Kentish and Speer also played well, creating many opportunities, but their poor shooting wasted their efforts.</p>
<p>Let's discuss the game and describe the battle situation. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Team</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan, Luo Quan, Hou Rongsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Liang Rongzhao, Zeng Zhongyun, Hou Chengtou, Zou Wenzhi, Li Huitang, Zhuo Shijin, Chen Bingtou</p>
<p>Navy Team</p>
<p>Heather, Sutcliff, Barros, Fraser, Dixon, Han Weilu, Kentish, Touche, Henty, Speer, Armstrong</p>
<p>Nearly ten thousand spectators came to watch the match, causing a stir in Happy Valley. The Navy arrived late, and the game started at four o'clock.</p>
<p>As soon as the game started, Shijin and Bingtou charged forward, but Barros intercepted them.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Shijin attacked again, firing a long-range shot that was slow, and Heather kicked it away.</p>
<p>After Chengtou was offside, Huitang made an initial probing attack, but Sutcliff blocked him, and Huitang had to retreat.</p>
<p>The Navy's forward line was eager to attack, but they could not overcome the Chinese team's defense and were unable to advance.</p>
<p>Soon after, Shijin and Bingtou combined to pressure the defense, with Shijin being particularly brave. Heather was trapped in a precarious position and could only barely save a corner kick. After Huitang took a shot, he was tackled by Touche.</p>
<p>Armstrong once attacked, but he was blocked by Jingcheng and Weiquan. On the other side, Huitang took two long-range shots, but both missed.</p>
<p>Kentish attacked again, but Rongsheng blocked him, resulting in a corner kick. Kentish delivered a dangerous ball, but Jun'gan made a fine save. Then Henty charged, but he was also stopped by Jun'gan.</p>
<p>At this moment, Jingcheng was injured and had to leave the field. Wenzhi immediately fell back to defend, just in case.</p>
<p>The Chinese team's morale was boosted and their attack did not diminish because of Jingcheng's temporary absence. Suddenly, Bingtou got the ball and sprinted forward. As he approached the goal line, he made a precise pass, but Chengtou missed the open goal, causing the spectators to sigh in disappointment.</p>
<p>Jingcheng returned, but he was less mobile. At this time, the Navy also gained momentum, and the Chinese team's defense was under pressure until Jun'gan cleared the ball, averting danger.</p>
<p>Shijin moved around actively and received a fine pass from Wenzhi, creating a promising opportunity, but he missed the shot.</p>
<p>Soon after, Bingtou also found an opening and shot at the goal, but the goalkeeper blocked it.</p>
<p>The Navy broke through and attacked again, and Rongzhao retreated to fight Touche, kicking the ball to the center. Huitang then passed it to Bingtou, who ran with the ball all the way. As he neared the goal, although he didn't score, the ball landed in front of Shijin. Huitang kicked it but unfortunately hit the post.</p>
<p>The two teams traded attacks, and the first half ended without any goals.</p>
<p>After the break, the Chinese team's attack became even more energetic. Soon after, Huitang passed the ball to Bingtou, who cut inside. Wenzhi headed the ball, and Heather, in a panic, punched it away. As the players scrambled, Bingtou arrived and slotted the ball into the net, opening the scoring and eliciting a roar of applause. At the same time, Shijin and Barros were both injured and fell to the ground. They left the field but soon returned.</p>
<p>The Chinese team took the lead, further boosting their morale. Bingtou attacked the goal again, and Heather dived to save it, but Shijin couldn't catch up, otherwise Heather would have conceded again.</p>
<p>After a period of siege, Dixon cleared the ball, and Speer, Henty, and Touche combined to attack. Seeing this, Rongsheng rushed to defend, but just as he reached Speer, the ball was shot, and Jun'gan's vision was blocked by Rongsheng. As he dived to save, the ball went into the net.</p>
<p>The score was tied at 1-1, making the situation tense. After the restart at the center, Huitang passed the ball to the left, and Wenzhi shot immediately. Heather was caught off guard and missed the ball, which went into the goal. The time between this goal and the previous one was less than a minute.</p>
<p>This was the golden age of the Chinese team. Soon after, Bingtou made another fine pass, but Chengtou was a step too late, missing a good opportunity.</p>
<p>A while later, Huitang made a fine pass, and Chengtou charged ahead, dribbling past Barros and Heather, and then shooting into the net, making the score 3-1.</p>
<p>The Navy, losing again, launched a counter-attack. Kentish and Touche took several dangerous shots at the goal, causing the spectators to tremble. Fortunately, Jun'gan made several brilliant saves, turning danger into safety.</p>
<p>Huitang had a chance to go one-on-one, but his shot missed. Then Shijin contested the ball with Dixon and was injured again. The Navy attacked again, causing Jun'gan to be very busy, but his good skills were on full display, earning praise from the spectators.</p>
<p>Shijin returned to the field, and the Soviet politics started again. Bingtou got the ball and passed it to the center perfectly. Huitang trapped and shot, Heather didn't know what to do. The ball went into the net, and the Chinese team's victory was sealed.</p>
<p>After that, the two teams continued to attack and defend, which was still entertaining. Until the horn sounded, the two armies collected their troops. Thus, the Chinese team won the final (Ball by Tai Sui).</p>
<h3 id="e46">Women's Basketball Game Tonight <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Three women's basketball games will be held at the basketball court tonight. The first game is Paul vs. Meifang. Paul is a weak team this year and will likely be easily defeated by Meifang. The second game is Snowflakes vs. Southwest. Although Snowflakes has Luo Qiaobin, Chen Manhong, and Chen Sihua, Southwest is quite strong and has Zhu Qingji, Wu Ruixin, and Ye Peizhi. With good leadership in the midfield, Snowflakes may not be their match. The third game is Sisi vs. Nanhua. Sisi is not a strong team, but Han Huixian, Zhong Qinfang, and Li Yumei are not weak in their offensive efforts. Nanhua has Li Ruomei, Li Yufen, and Li Shuzi. Therefore, Sisi will likely need to fight hard to achieve the final victory.</p>

<p>Entertainment... The Baroness and the Butler</p>
<p>Baroness and the Butler</p>
<p>Originally a famous stage comedy, now adapted into a film, the story itself has a strong comedic flavor, coupled with the humorous stars William Powell and Anna Bella's energetic performances, making this film an excellent and successful work.</p>
<p>William Powell plays a butler, the most capable servant in a certain earl's household, handling all household matters meticulously. The entire earl's family is extremely satisfied with him. But unexpectedly, this butler secretly engages in political activities and is elected as a member of parliament, standing on the side of the party opposed to his master. Professionally, he is a loyal servant to his master, but politically, he eloquently attacks his master. The earl is broad-minded and understanding, but the earl's daughter, a standard aristocratic lady (played by Anna Bella), is the most unconvinced. The conflicting situation creates a series of jokes.</p>
<p>The film has excellent dialogue, containing truth within humor. William Powell's style remains unchanged, with calm composure concealing laughter. Anna Bella, in her first American-made film, also gives an excellent performance.</p>
<p>Queen... Excerpts from Color Films</p>
<p>Walt Disney's pen-and-ink cartoons are praised and welcomed by every audience, especially after the success of his bold attempt with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", attracting greater attention from film enthusiasts. The screening of "Excerpts from Color Films" selects and combines his latest works, a total of ten films, listed below:</p>
<p>"The Fox Hunt", "The Mad Parrot", "Livestock Symphony", "Golfing Jokes", "Prince of the Crystal Palace", "Silver Anniversary", "Whaling Record", "Lucky Day", "Incompatible Cattle", "Giant Record"</p>
<p>The painting techniques, as well as the coordination of colors and sounds, are perfect. The stories are concise and lively, full of rich interest. In addition to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, there are also new creations. Among them, "Incompatible Cattle", "Prince of the Crystal Palace", "Silver Anniversary Fairy Tale", and "Giant Record" are particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>Peace... Modern Female Detective</p>
<p>The Mad Miss Manton</p>
<p>A film that combines romance and mysterious murder cases, performed in a humorous and crazy style. Bai Peilan Stanfei plays a spoiled socialite who accidentally discovers a corpse and reports it to the police. When the detectives arrive, the corpse has already been moved away by the murderer. Because of her usual behavior, people think it's a lie she made up to get attention. This clearly wrongs her, and what she can't stand is that a young editor (Henry Fonda) coldly mocks her in the newspaper. So, she unites a group of sisters to conduct detective work. After discovering a second corpse, people sympathize and believe her, especially the young editor, who provides great help. At that time, the murderer tries to kill her to silence her, but she is saved by the police who surround and annihilate the murderer.</p>
<p>The plot in the film lacks some possibilities, but the excellent performances of the actors make the development of the plot natural and relaxed. The arrangement of the assassination case is also quite tortuous, but it does not occupy an important position in the film, because what seems to attract people in this film is not a tense and serious detective story, but a strong sense of comedy.</p>
<p>East... Everybody Sing</p>
<p>Starring Judy Garland, whose singing voice is not as moving as Diana Po Ping, but is also an extremely talented newcomer. The film writes about a drama-crazed family, so everything is biased towards comedy and song and dance. It has the colors of general Hollywood musicals. She not only sings well, but also has good expressions. Allen Jones is not as outstanding as in "A Dragon Advises the Army".</p>
<p>Dahua... Adventures of Tom Sawyer</p>
<p>A very good literary film based on Mark Twain's thick book. Although the whole film is very long, the director handles it well. The light and lively rhythm makes us not feel bored. Part of it is also due to the outstanding performances of a group of child actors, especially the two leads. Aunt Mei's performance is also very good. The color photography further increases the value of the film.</p>
<p>New World... Zheng Yi, A Affectionate Seed</p>
<p>Starring Xu Manli, Fu Shanxiao</p>
<p>Central... Pearl Shirt</p>
<p>Chen Charlie of Hollywood had only just passed away, and now a Chen Charlie has emerged in the Chinese film industry. This speculative means requires no publicity efforts and can reap the benefits of a draw. The cleverness of Chinese filmmakers is evident from this, but the film's content and story are not cleverly written. At the same time, all the tense scenes failed to be fully developed. The description of the actions of the bandits failed more than it succeeded. The allocation of actors was also not very suitable. Except for Gu Qiong, who had a fair level of success, Gu Lanjun and Hong Ling did not act in the play. Xu Qunyuan's Chen Charlie. The facial makeup is quite similar, but the imitation of actions is still a long way off.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Nanhua Fights South Vietnam B at Night; Nanhua Performs Excellently, Winning 4-2 <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Saigon Airmail Special Dispatch) Yesterday, the 14th (Saturday) night, the Nanhua football team, which had triumphed three times, fought against the South Vietnam League B team at the Saigon Stone Stadium. The reporter, driven by the fans, arrived early. The audience that night was still very crowded, but slightly less than the previous game. The reason is that Gong has been losing for days, and the local audience's expectations have greatly diminished. The reason for the slightly smaller number of visitors that night may be based on this. At 8 o'clock, the game began, first by two local barefoot teams playing to entertain the audience. At the beginning of the battle, the two teams fought bravely, but thousands of fans were determined to admire Nanhua's skills. They mostly ignored the barefoot immortals, focusing on the arrival of the swan and the five mountains rather than the spring mountains. Looking forward eagerly, the spectators were quite anxious. Suddenly, applause erupted, and the Nanhua flag fluttered in front of the audience amid tens of thousands of cheers. The lineup that night was as follows:</p>
<p>Nanhua Club</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Li Guowei, Liu Qingcai, Liu Tianshen, Liu Songsheng, Xie Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>South Vietnam B</p>
<p>Fei, Abe, Arashi, Arden, Kiju, Ayin, Akai, Abang, Dinu, Ashida, Amon</p>
<p>As the silver whistle blew, the two teams clashed. The League team took the offensive first, and enemy figures appeared frequently in Nanhua's camp. Our army was very busy dealing with the attacks, but fortunately, the defenders were doing their best to defend the territory. Zhang Rongcai saved several goals in a row, which can be called excellent. Tiansheng was still strong, desperately defending the city. The League team had two corner kicks, both of which were cleared by Tiansheng, and the League team missed the opportunity. Nanhua then turned to attack. Xie Zhaorong got the ball on the right, and Yang Shuiyi launched an attack on the frontier, shooting desperately, but was unfortunately caught by the enemy goalkeeper. It was accidental. The League team counterattacked and approached our goal. The center "Dinu" kicked with all his strength, and the audience was shocked and very nervous, but unfortunately, his foot was not accurate, and the ball flew high and out. "Dinu" was indeed low-energy, just shouting haha. The two sides fought for a long time, but there was no construction. The South team had been quiet for a long time and began to move, trying to attack. Shuiyi was short and agile, Songsheng was brave and crowned the three armies, Jingxiang was experienced and old-fashioned, Xie was amazingly skilled, and Dehui attacked the enemy's goal, but was thrown down. Shuiyi was given a corner kick, and Zhaorong missed a kick, which was a pity. At this time, the League team's rearguard was still feeling guerrilla harassment. Traces of our army could be seen everywhere in the enemy's city gate. Shuiyi got a send-off from Dehui, and Dehui was blessed. Xie Zhaorong did not fail his mission and scored with a kick, and the audience cheered and praised him. Not arrogant in victory, Nanhua attacked the enemy's goal again. Jingxiang got the ball and was very magical, breaking through ten. Aiming accurately, he shot the ball forcefully, which can be called a fatal blow, but unfortunately, it hit the door frame and bounced out of the city. Zhaorong rushed forward and kicked the ball over the goal, and the audience was happy. What? The central general Dehui carried the ball to seize the throne, flew over three passes, bravely passed six generals, and gently picked the ball into the goal, and the audience cheered, praising him as the pride of art.</p>
<p>Becoming angry out of shame, a League player began to foul. His offside action attacked Jingxiang's magic legs, displaying his brutality. Two defenders also gradually presented the skills of Qian Donkey (kicking people with their hind hooves). Zuo General Songsheng was not afraid and bravely grabbed several balls, greatly frustrating his arrogance. A kick arrived, but Jingxiang's header was in vain, which was a pity. Then, the silver whistle blew, and the first half was over. Nanhua took the lead with one to zero. After eating the lemon, he reorganized his hero. The League team launched a counter-attack, with two corner kicks, which were very urgent. He accepted it with shame, Rongcai took it back twice, and General Qingcai got the ball and sent it to Shen Leg, and Jingxiang played a beautiful style, passing it to Shuiyi to cause trouble on the border, and Shuiyi scored with one kick.</p>
<p>After losing three balls, the League team felt too much loss. Encouraged by the onlookers, they began to turn hard and change the mountains. At first, Nanhua was based on art and did not pay attention to it, so they contained their edge and slightly let the opponent have a chance to move. Songsheng was tackled, and Guowei could not bear to sit idly by, and rushed forward. The opponent's right guard turned his buttocks to the sky, with a tumbling gourd, deservedly. The audience was delighted.</p>
<p>Songsheng was majestic in all directions, bravely surpassing the enemy generals, and fell down quickly, but was caught empty. Jingxiang was full of skill, and his art was skilled. Seeing Arden intentionally picking on Pingtong's legs, he performed magical balls, and Arden was barbaric, but there was no way to do it. At this time, the war had turned into worsening. The enemy riders were gradually seen in our camp, and the wind and smoke outside the Great Wall. Tiansheng worked hard, but even a thousand Lu would have a loss. The League team took the opportunity to shoot a goal in the middle, breaking his clean sheet record. From then on, the League team's military prestige was slightly shaken, and its unruly intentions gradually became apparent. With the army approaching the city, the enemy was in a hurry, pulling people and pulling hands, pushing and shoving. People are fair, and the sentence is a penalty. Jingxiang, who was the main kicker, gave up on his own, and the audience praised Wu. The team gained momentum and attacked. Tiansheng gave up the rescue, and the ball accidentally touched his hand. Being sentenced and scoring automatically, Abang took the main kick, concentrating on the whole spirit, and struggling to throw, and it really entered the net. Our team did not consider it a humiliation, and tried to counterattack. The army started, and in a blink of an eye, it went deep into the enemy's line. Xie got the ball and sent Dehui. The three armies started, and the big fear of the battle was announced. Returning to the teacher to save the emergency, Naine was too numerous and confused, and Mo Wan was frantic. De scored in the million army, kicking the success and laying the record of the last victory. What? With the silver whistle once, Nanhua played the triumphal song with four to two. (Zhu Zhaoheng)</p>

<p>The Fifth Plenary Session is convened at a new stage of the War of Resistance, in an environment where national traitors are being purged and the internal and external situations of the War of Resistance are improving. At the same time, it is also convened under the new military offensive launched by the × people. This conference has a solemn significance and a great role in the future of the War of Resistance. This is what all the people of China today, especially comrades engaged in cultural work, need to deeply recognize.</p>
<p>According to a Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 19th, the content of this conference is very rich, such as: further strengthening military and political institutions; severely expanding and carrying out anti-traitor work, confiscating all property of national traitors; reducing taxes and improving people's livelihood to concentrate the vital forces of the entire nation; revising the regulations of the Three People's Principles Youth League to further unite the youth of the country, expand and develop the united front organization of the national youth; establishing a special committee to handle cooperation matters between various parties; establishing an international anti-aggression front, etc. These are all urgent tasks of this conference, and also the work that the people of the whole country eagerly hope the government will quickly resolve.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, cultural workers, facing such a Fifth Plenary Session, should undertake the following five tasks: First, to conduct widespread publicity and explanation of the significance of this conference to the masses, to hold various forms of seminars, celebrations, and even review meetings after the Fifth Plenary Session, etc. In various forms of meetings, to raise the enthusiasm and understanding of the masses about this conference. Second, to fully reflect the hopes and opinions of the people regarding this conference; according to the living environment and specific conditions of the masses, to raise the issues that are particularly felt to be needed and concerned, and link them to the issue of the second phase of the War of Resistance, so that the masses deeply recognize that the Fifth Plenary Session is a conference that directly relates to the entire War of Resistance and directly relates to the happiness of the people across the country. Third, to take various opinions and propositions related to the future War of Resistance as the goals of all future movements, so that everyone consciously understands that it is necessary to complete these goals with a more proactive attitude. Fourth, cultural workers, under this new situation, should strengthen their concern for political issues, unite personal life with the political life of the entire War of Resistance, and enhance the active role of cultural work in the future War of Resistance. Fifth, continue the anti-traitor movement in culture. This movement has a particularly serious significance at present because various pro-Japanese traitors and the special service agencies of Japanese imperialism are shamelessly attempting to use various despicable means to undermine this Fifth Plenary Session. Certain pro-Japanese and traitorous newspapers are spreading hateful rumors every day, slandering the government, and sabotaging the War of Resistance. Everyone understands the importance of this work.</p>
<p>The above work should be enthusiastically carried out by comrades in the cultural circles not only during the Fifth Plenary Session, but especially after the Fifth Plenary Session.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Record of a Trip Back and Forth to Pingshi and Lechang <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jian</p>
<p>The car arrived in Binzhou at dusk, and it was already one o'clock in the deep night when we arrived in Lechang. I heard that we could reach Guangzhou tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>However, the car stopped for an hour, then another hour. Later, I learned that something was damaged in the front axle of the engine. It was repaired and repaired again. Seeing that it was dawn, and the × planes were sure to come and bomb every day, it was very dangerous to move forward. So the car retreated back amidst the curses of the passengers.</p>
<p>The impatience and anxiety of the passengers were immediately soothed by half by the beautiful scenery outside the car window - the highway climbed along the upper reaches of the Beijiang River. To the west was not only the Beijiang River, but also towering peaks and dense green trees. It was rare to see a few reddish-brown wooden houses. There were many white stone beaches in the Beijiang River. When the clear green water reached there, it stirred up whiter waves like boiling water. From time to time, there was a wooden raft or a few small boats by the river. Shrinking back behind the car window, many passengers were heard thanking the retreat for allowing them to see the scenery they had missed while sleeping last night.</p>
<p>Around ten o'clock, we arrived at Pingshi and stopped for repairs. I heard that it was repaired, so we set off for Lechang again at three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Not long after arriving at the Lechang station, we heard the sound of airplanes. Passengers and vendors scattered into the fields. The plane flew overhead, just circling. A bold and observant station attendant later discovered that it was our own plane, so he announced loudly - passengers, this is when they gathered again.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed at the unnecessary hiding just now. At this time, a station attendant standing next to me told me a story of the × planes this month:</p>
<p>One day, three × bombers came to bomb the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. One of them crashed into the mountain wall while soaring up after diving, and fell down. The next day, two more enemy planes flew over and circled above our heads. Finally, we saw one of the planes drop a ball of something. People lying on the ground were waiting for the violent explosion sound and the flying soil, but there was no sound at all. At that time, the × planes also flew away quickly.</p>
<p>What was going on? Everyone was curious, so a station attendant ran to see what was going on. Near the crashed × plane, there were two wreaths lying on the ground. A letter was attached to the wreath, containing twenty yuan of Central Bank notes and a short pair of letters. The gist was: "We are all forced to fight and do not want to massacre the people of your country. We firmly believe that the time for handshakes and good relations is not far away. Please use the money in the letter to bury the Japanese pilot, and please put the wreath on the grave," and so on.</p>
<p>The car still did not start at nine o'clock in the evening. I heard that the engine was broken again and was being repaired in the engine factory. So the platform gradually filled with passengers, and there were voices of dissatisfaction and blame everywhere, but there were also cold and sarcastic words. I heard one sentence.</p>
<p>"It would be great if the expedition was so enthusiastic!"</p>
<p>If the people who escaped to the safe rear and evaded their sacred responsibilities heard this sentence, I think they would at least be ashamed and sweat.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the engine was connected. It was still the broken engine. At first, everyone was worried that it would break down halfway. Many people who forced the stationmaster to put on this engine began to complain that others should not be so impatient, but all the way through Qujiang and Yingde, the uneasy people were able to sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>Blame and attack are the easiest, and enjoying success is also the easiest, but there are still few who try their best to help. I thought of the engine, and I kept saying that to myself.</p>
<h3 id="e53">A Little Friend Who Died for His Country <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— You Ru</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from Zhu Jun, saying that her younger brother, Tong Jun, died suddenly in Boluo County due to overwork after illness when he set off to serve on the East River front last year. Tong Jun was the son of my friend. This sacrifice for the country made me feel sad both personally and publicly.</p>
<p>I remember last year, Tong Jun was only eighteen years old and had always been the only son loved by your mother. However, he did not listen to his family's advice and resolutely joined the conscript team. At that time, your passionate enthusiasm moved me greatly. "I would rather die on the battlefield than stay at home." Didn't you say such fierce words? I knew that the words would really become your own request.</p>
<p>When you wore the uniform of the conscript team for the first time and participated in military training that day, how happy and excited you were, straightening your chest, taking strides, and striding proudly into the house. I still remember your posture very clearly. You have always been gentle and obedient, but you have gradually become stubborn; you have always been approachable, but you have gradually become brave and fierce. You became a lover of guns and wished you could grab one and keep it by your side, so that you could kill the × people and traitors at any time. You were always annoyed by this, not understanding why the government did not issue guns to you. "A Tong has changed." Your mother was very worried about you; she repeatedly asked me to dissuade you, but why should I dissuade you? You have not done anything wrong. On the contrary, I sympathize with you very much. You are being tempered day by day in the furnace of the national revolutionary war, just like other sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The bombing of Huangsha continued for a year. Every time you rescued injured compatriots, you risked going to the disaster area. You were too anxious. You had to go before the air raid alarm was lifted. Didn't you get injured once or twice because of this? Looking back now, it was a great miracle that you did not die in the bombing of Huangsha at that time.</p>
<p>However, speaking of your death, I can't help but blame you: You were really too anxious. You shouldn't have rushed to the front line after a serious illness without even resting for a while. "The × people are about to invade, why rest? Even if I don't have the strength to take a gun to kill ×, it's good to do some rescue and transportation work." You used this as a reason to reject our advice. When you participated in the pre-war service team and set off for Boluo that day, I saw your pale face and frail body, and I was already worried about your health. Alas! Who would have thought that you really lost your life due to weakness and overwork! I heard that when you were carried back to the apartment that day, you lay down and fell down, and you parted ways with us forever!</p>
<p>You did not die from the bombing of the × people, nor did you die from the terrible tropical fever, but you died on the front line of the War of Resistance, in your own post. This may be the happiest thing for you. Although you cannot hold a gun to kill × and die on the battlefield, you are just as brave and just as heroic as them.</p>
<p>When I received the letter from your sister, I couldn't help but feel pain for a while, and tears almost came out. But I immediately held back. I know that sorrow is an insult to you. I should only praise and admire your death.</p>
<p>Tong! You have already died. In the history of national revolution, you have your glorious achievements. That spirit of not fearing death will always shine in the hearts of your friends and comrades; moreover, for them, it is also a powerful spur and encouragement.</p>
<p>Tong! You are forever immortal in our hearts.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Starting from a Strange Fire <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Chi</p>
<p>A few days ago (the 15th), a Hong Kong evening newspaper contained the following news:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Electric (Mingxing Company (the 13th, a big fire, the cause is unknown, but the × side had previously sought cooperation, but Mingxing did not allow it, and the next day there was a fire.</p>
<p>The headline is:</p>
<p>"Strange Fire Occurs at Shanghai Mingxing Company"</p>
<p>Fire and strange are really unheard of before. The reason why the fire at Mingxing Company is called strange is because it did not allow cooperation with the × side, and the next day there was a fire. What is the reason? Probably everyone can imagine it. This is also what we are used to seeing. If it gets strange, it is really infinitely strange. Just in Shanghai alone, the discovery of strange planes, strange bullets, and strange leaflets is almost a daily occurrence, and these strange things all happen because they do not allow cooperation with the × side. The discovery of strange planes spreading strange leaflets impersonating our ambassador abroad is because our government does not allow cooperation with the × side and compromise halfway. The discovery of strange bullets is because people of integrity do not allow cooperation with the × side and are willing to be puppets of the × side. There are countless similar examples. However, this also shows that the × side is becoming increasingly exhausted.</p>
<p>As for fire, like the strange fire that occurred at Mingxing Company, it has already spread across half of China today, and many places have been burned to scorched earth. If we are not forgetful, we will always remember that the × side would have asked us to talk to them about "Japan-China Cooperation" and "China-Japan-Manchukuo Anti-Communist Agreement" and other types of cooperation. However, can this strange fire make us afraid? No, we are not afraid at all. Because we are not afraid of such strange fire, such strange fire may spread even more. This is also what we expected, but I am not afraid. Only the weak-willed national traitors will tremble in the face of this strange fire, and thus be cowardly and weak, falling into the trap of the × side. Now, the new Qin Hui, who has always been spreading pessimistic and defeated views, has publicly surrendered to the × side because he is afraid of this fire that has burned across half of China. But this is also good. We just want to use this strange fire to extinguish the internal corruption of our nation.</p>
<p>An ancient saying says: "If you see something strange and don't find it strange, the strangeness will defeat itself." We not only want to make the strange fire that occurs because we do not allow cooperation with the × side defeat and extinguish itself, but we also want to grow and become strong from this strange fire, and completely eliminate all the people who set the strange fire!</p>
<h3 id="e55">Jottings on the March <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Where did the owner of the house move to? What did he do? Moving, why didn't he move his things away? So, what is the reason for this? That's right, the "army" and the "people" should cooperate, but looking at this situation, can the word "cooperation" still be uttered? However, should the blame be placed on the ordinary people for this? Please think, if there is no other reason for the ordinary people living well, they would not want to leave their hometowns and go far away. Those who understand a little should be able to guess a little reason. No matter what "sacred" and "great" nice-sounding words, they cannot completely cover up the "faults."</p>
<p>The political education of the army and the basic education of the people seem so important! From this, we can know the difficulties of mobilizing the masses even more.</p>
<p>I saw many empty houses by the roadside, and I felt a heavy stimulation in my heart; but later, when I caught up with the team and arrived at Linshanhe, the market in this small town was more prosperous than when I passed by a month ago.</p>
<p>Reaching Linshanhe Again</p>
<p>The season has already reached autumn. This is because when we arrived at Linshanhe, we saw that many decent people on the street had changed into long robes.</p>
<p>This small town is only three miles away from the shore of the lake. People who live by fishing in the lake take the fish they catch to the fish market here every day to sell. When we opened east last time, we lived in the fish market, and this time we opened north, we lived in the same place, and became familiar friends with the big-bellied fat boss.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>As soon as we met, he put on a smiling face and asked with concern. Then, without waiting for a reply, he said:</p>
<p>"You are very hard."</p>
<p>"It's nothing. This time we are opening north, and the place is not yet certain. It's too much trouble for you."</p>
<p>"Don't be polite." (To be continued)</p>
