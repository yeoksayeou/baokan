<h3 id="c1">歐洲風雲與遠東 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自從意大利用強力佔領阿爾巴尼亞並向希臘進逼以來，中南歐的情勢忽然十分緊張起來。一方面德意頗有協同進攻中南歐各小國並加以吞併的積極行動的傾向，另一方面英法兩國也忙於準備積極抵抗，据美聯社本日電，「英法艦隊已奉到政府密令，操握各軍事要點，現正向地中海集中」，幷聞英國已準備以外交方式取得科孕島爲海軍根据地；以抵抗意大利，英國且已通知意大利：「如有侵佔希臘領土的行為；不論港口或島嶼，即將惹起戰爭」。然而意大利方面則不但絲毫不表示退讓，並且有更積極聯結德國作更大規模的軍事行動，中南歐的局勢，可說業已劍拔弩張，大有一觸即發之可能。</p>
<p>在這情勢下首先値得注意的，當然是英國政府的態度。張伯倫雖然一再向意大利提出警告，並與法國取得一致行動，把兩國海軍集中於亞德里亞海的入口處，但是張伯倫目前的辦法仍不出於設法與莫索里尼謀取妥協，甚至於承認意併阿爾巴尼亞。倫教方面的消息，一面傳英國如何如何積極，對意如何如何提出警告，但另一面英外部却否認「政府有警告意方勿犯料孚島及聲明此舉足以釀成戰爭之事」。這是英國一貫對德意侵略者示弱的態度，怪不得「小巴黎人報」預斷英國尙「不至於宣布將該約（一九三八年四月十六日的英意協定）廢除。」</p>
<p>我們應該提醒的，是英國積極採取抵抗強權的辦法，不論中南歐的大小國家，甚至不分東西被侵略或擁護和平的國家，全體切實聯結起來，以集體安全的方式，實行對侵略者的抵抗，行動要積極，規模要廣大，始可；現在的形勢已經相當成熱，不但各小國皆已誠意接受英國的保證及互助協定，並且有些國家皆已願意加入歐洲的和平陣線，聞張伯倫已將於星期四向衆院宣佈：「希臘及士耳其已加入歐洲和平陣線」，則中南歐抵抗侵略的集體行動是在日益成熟，已無疑義，這裏，英法兩國在組織這一反侵略陣線上應注意的一點：蘇聯的參加具有絕大的力量。倫敦方面所傳消息，「英法兩國現在與蘇聯及巴爾幹各國進行更密切的合作」，這是非常好的傾向，我們還希望英法這一努力能更加積極，勿存對意大利行動的期待。英法須知：蘇聯已經切實與土耳其力謀聯合，這一聯合的結果，很足控制黑海及韃靻納爾海峽，對於德意的東進是一種極大的阻力。同時，蘇聯和希臘也正在謀軍事的合作，這一計劃成功，則卽令羅馬尼亞與波蘭不欲聯繫，其實力也足以抵拒意大利和保加利亞的聯合行動。</p>
<p>在歐洲風雲乍緊的情勢下，遠東的戰事也有進一步的緊急，一方面日軍積極增兵於華北，華中及華南各地，企圖積極向我進攻，但另一方面，我軍各綫的準備也已完成，且已發動反攻，各路的軍事已有相當的進展。當歐洲風雲緊張的今日，日本積極進攻中國，是當然的趨向，不過應向反侵略各國提醒的事項是：世界侵略者的行動是一致的，日本的元老，重臣，乃至一部分財界有力者雖然反對軍事之更大的擴大，但是瘋狂的少壯派軍人却正要利用這良好機會以擴大他們的計劃，鎭壓國內的反戰情緒和行動。對於這一大勢，我們希望英美法各國不要忘記了這一東方侵略者的乘火打刼。微聞英國已决定對日本的進攻，準備作有力量迎擊。又聞美國將在衆院席上討論禁止售賣軍火給日本的問題，並且考慮盡量貸欵與我國援助抗戰。卽中立法一項，也已有議員主張修改，因該法對華不利。無論如何，英美對日本應有更積極的行動，東西和平國家積極行動，並切實合作，才能够發生阻止侵略的實效。</p>
<h3 id="c2">中國青年開拓抗戰勝利之路 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 英J.Gordan作　梅真譯</p>
<p>中國方面，過去數月內，最値得注意的事是各黨派團結的更加堅强，全國各綫抗戰軍事之在本質上奠定了主動的勝利的基礎。在這種團結和抗戰之勝利地開展之中，中國的靑年學生，是盡了極大的力量的。</p>
<p>當汪精衛於去年十二月暴露其面目，叛離祖國，主張向日本的軍閥主義屈服，和日本政府講和的時候，他在全中國得不到任何支持。雖然他曾是國民黨最髙領袖之一，雖然他曾是中央政治委員會的主席，仍舊只有極少數孤立的個人跟他逃跑。中國的人民和靑年一致指斥他這種叛逆的行動。在他叛國出亡的不多幾天之中，汪精衛開除國民黨黨藉的消息立刻傳出，全國各軍事領袖還共同簽名發表宣言，指汪精衞爲賣國賊，並且要求嚴勵懲辦。中國政府的領袖蔣委員長，也於不多幾天以內發出吿民衆書，表示堅持團結抗戰到底的决心。全國各界民衆團體的成千成萬的决心，像怒潮般湧入重慶，一致斥責汪精衞，表示擁護中央政府，並决心繼續抗戰。中國的各種靑年及學生團體，對這抗戰的政策，都表示擁護，並過通要求通緝汪精衞的議案。</p>
<p>自汪精衞離祖國以後，中國內部的政治的團結，已有很大的開展。因爲當注精衛還在國內的時候，他和他的黨羽不斷的密施陰謀，激起各黨之間尤其是國共兩黨之間的衝突，同時他還用種種方法挑撥人民與政府之衝突，使人民背棄抗戰的國策。但汪精衞叛離中國以後，這種活動的力量巳大爲削弱，現在，國共兩黨的關係已比以前更密切了。他們並巳成立一個共同委員會，同時，中國靑年運動的團結也已加强，例如，政府於去年六月所成立的三民主義靑年節，起初在章程上有限制別黨別派的人員加人决定，可是現在，所爲靑年，各黨各派的人員，都可以自由加入三民主義靑年圑了，（共產黨曾於六中全會中决議不在國民黨內三民主義靑年團內吸收份子發展組織——譯者註）</p>
<p>這種抗戰的團結和意義，已在本年（一九三九年）一月下旬在重慶舉行的五中全會中明白表示出來。在這會議上，蔣委員長說：</p>
<p>「中國人民必須繼續抗戰，直至最後勝利，日本軍事計劃的挫折，建立的政權的政策的失敗，以及國內局勢的惡化，都明白表示在中國的冒險的崩潰。中國决不妥協和讓步。！」</p>
<p>五中全會於結束時發表了吿全國民衆書，鼔勵人民堅持抗戰，並嘉獎全國前綫將士的英勇的戰績。它還通過了一個在西部各省加緊經濟建設的議案，並發表宣言，說明中國民衆的團結，目的的合一，及士兵的勇敢，爲中國最後勝利的基礎。五中全會在團結和抗戰的路途上又前進了重要的一步。全國靑年和學生，又以示威和决議，擁護這次會議。</p>
<p>由於中國內部的加强團結，過去的兩個月，從軍事的觀點看來，已經成爲抗戰勝利的月份。自漢口和廣州陷落以後，日軍並沒有前進，他們在許多地方反却後退。中國軍隊在山西，在第八路軍的領導下，干今年一月月初發動了總的反攻，並收復了好幾個重要的地方，（收復了呂梁山脈一帶大寧吉樂蒲縣等，繼去年十二月之打破日軍對晉察冀邊區的八路進攻和對晉西北的進攻之後，又粉碎了日軍對晋西的進攻；現在日軍對晉南向中條山脈的進攻，又在八路軍及山西軍的英勇抗戰下遭遇慘敗了——譯者）這意思就是，日本設計多時的越黄河以攻陝西的計劃，尙不能開始實施。</p>
<p>今午二月的第一個星期，中國的游擊隊一共毀壤了三十八個日軍的車頭，一四八輛的各式的兵車，三九〇〇公尺的鐵道，十四座橋棵，並殺死了八〇〇個日兵。這數字只是華北沿平漢路在一星期內戰事的結果。在過去兩個月內，京滬綫也屢遭截斷。山東，河南和安徽的游擊隊，統統獲得重要的勝利。他們一共作戰二五六次，殺死日軍一二五〇〇人，奪獲機關槍二一四挺，步槍三六五〇枝。在廣東省，戰事仍在廣州市的四週進行，日軍雖已開到大量的援軍，仍未能獲得重要的進展。</p>
<p>日本的空軍，以漢口爲根據地，不絕向中國平民及不設防的城市施行殘酷的轟炸，以作對於中國人民抗日的報復，有幾個廣東的小城，於十四天之內，被炸了三十六次，四川省的萬縣，於上星期的轟炸中，慘死的就有一千人，中國的臨時首都重慶，受害亦甚慘重。但是日軍這種胡亂的破壞與屠殺，僅足以加强中國民衆的憤努及抗戰的意志。</p>
<p>在英勇的抗戰中，中國靑年和學生，已演着重大的角色。無論在前綫或在後方，他們都做着敎育和救濟的工作。靑年和學生團體所執行的普及敎育工作正在開展。例如，近來在重慶已經開辦了六〇〇個平民敎育班，他們希望於一九三九年底，卽能掃除重慶的文盲。一隻敎育船，裏面帶着各種敎育品，書籍，圖書和地圖，影片，無綫電機，歌泳團和演劇隊等等，由靑年和學生們主持着，在山川的各河道中來來去去地駛行着，進行擴大宣傳敎育的工作。</p>
<p>在前綫及游擊區中，中國的靑年。做着許多英勇的工作。在八路軍中，在五路軍中，在新四軍中。在其他中央軍中，靑年服務抗戰的成績，尤爲各方所贊羨。在四川，廣西，雲南，貴州，陝西和陝甘寗邊區，晉察冀邊區，靑年正在加緊軍事訓練。在陝甘寗邊區的抗日大學，共有五萬靑年等待入學，那裏已有數萬學生們在受着游擊戰，民埃統一戰綫和國際知識等訓練。在國立軍事學校的報吿的學生，竟多得使學校當局很難選擇。在山西，察哈爾河北等所謂淪陷區內亦巳成立了一個新的軍事學校，（設在晉察冀邊區的××××××——譯者）給予靑年以三個月的游擊訓練。</p>
<p>中國於最近的幾個月內，抗戰已經勝利地在開展了，團結也更加强固了，日本當局以前誇口在八個月到十個月的時間，卽能征服中國，現在終於不能不呼喊其長期作戰，「或十年，或廿年」的必要了。在這引導中國到最後勝利的鬥爭中，中國靑年已經担負最重要的任務。</p>
<h3 id="c3">生長的新中國 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 齋賀美羅夫作　逸疇譯</p>
<p>中國反抗異族侵略者，解放戰爭，已經是到了第二的階段了，中國的軍隊，在×人優越的機械化部隊壓迫下，廣州和漢口，因以陷落。日本最後的企圖，在黄河一帶的陣綫上，意圍採取包圍的戰略，來削弱中國軍隊的主力；但是這層，已遭遇着充分的失敗，中國軍隊的力量，不但仍舊保存着，而且作戰方面，越是聰明得多了。確實的說：中國現在的軍隊，差不多有二百四十師。每師當中，有士兵一萬名。比較在戰爭開始的時候，已經是增加了不少。中國軍隊裏頭的每個戰士，在戰爭的技術方面，是提髙了。如果說：在第一期的開始，中國軍隊的損失，是三與一之比的說話；那末在第一期之末，是一與一之比。至於第二期的戰事呢，卽正如蔣介石將軍所說的話一樣：「中國軍隊，按照其自己戰關的質量來說，每個中國士民。將可等於三個萎糜不振的日本士兵」。</p>
<p>戰線的延長，已有四千英里。這里已苦了日本發生着很嚴重的進攻戰略。因此，他們的調動，不得不稱爲變更。日本的軍隊，一深入到了多山的地帶，卽喪失其以陸軍，艦隊，飛機和機械化部隊各部份同時進攻的可能。當中國軍隊預備去實行反攻的時候，日本軍隊。勢必被迫的放棄其太過散浸的各部份，而向其主力據點和交通線緊縮。</p>
<p>在「抗戰到底」的準備中，中國方面，已急速的計劃發展其經濟的綦礎於中國西部和西南各省。在四川省巳經築好了很多的汽車公路。根據「華北每日新聞報」的報吿：今年一月，中國西南各處，巳開始實施其建築鐵路的計劃。第一條鐵路線，將達於緬甸的邊界。這條鐵路，對於中國經濟，是含有重大的意義；同時亦卽是使外來的軍用品的供給，有輸入中國的可能。</p>
<p>中國工業的設立，通常是偏重於沿海一帶。現在呢，中國本部的工業，已一槪遷移於中國的西部。沿海各省，有很多的企業，曾被日本破壞；但是亦有不少比較重要的工廠，中國政府，已把她遷徙到深入的內地去。</p>
<p>由工業的發展，同時亦卽發現了很多「取之無盡，用之不竭」的資源。在四川省，已蘊藏着大量的煤礦，其數目約在十萬萬噸以上。一九三九年，採出的煤，將達二百萬噸以上；而在一九三八年，採出的僅是一百萬噸。重慶的西邊，有兩個叫做威遠縣和自流井縣的，那裏有很豐富的石油礦區。</p>
<p>還有一個，叫做綦江縣的，已開始找着鐵礦，在最近每月可得鐵四百萬噸。四川的西部又開始找着銅礦；同時亦有金礦發現，從外省遷來的企業，約在三百家以上。大部份已開始工作，尙有從天津搬來的規模稍大的化學工厰。</p>
<p>四川的隣省——貴州，是四川省糖食供給的最大來源。其牲畜業亦相當的發達，擁有很多豐富的各種天然的財源：鋼，鐵，煤，水艱等礦。這些礦坑，巳開始從事掘採。此外，還有二十個縣，發現有金礦。路政方面，亦頗爲發達。現在每日差不多有十萬工人，在開築着將石碎舖成的大道。將來再從這種大道改做鐵路。重慶至昆明的中間，亦有一條很長的石碎道連貫着。</p>
<p>不久以前，新成立的省份——西康，亦是發展工業最好的地帶，而且具有很大的水源。從雅安有一條鐵路通康定。這條鐵路，現在亦有十萬人在建築着。盧邊至雲南。亦預備築成一條鐵路。這條鐵路是經西昌而直通會理——那是一個備藏鐵，煤，鉛，銀等礦的地方。是中國西部的一個大工業區。</p>
<p>這，卽是新中國預備爲自己國家的獨立和自由而長期抗戰的資源與基礎。</p>
<p>十九個月的戰爭，日本侵略者，竟佔據了中國二十八個行省中的九個行省。雖然，這七百九十六個縣當中，僅有五十九個縣，是歸日本統制着。其餘的四百八十九個縣，則仍然是歸中國中央政府的管轄。</p>
<p>中國的國民，堅决的在爲着「最後勝利」，向異族的侵略者而鬬爭。這個原則，已由國民黨的五中全會，很明顯的指示過。不單是軍民的團結加强，國共永久合作的基礎，亦因此而愈益鞏固</p>
<p>爲自己國家的獨立而鬥爭，英勇的中國國民，在這時候，已無限度的提高他們的政治活動。廣大的民衆階層，在國民黨裏頭，不斷的表示他們自己的政治傾向。一般妥協份子，已很難堅持他們的投降的和叛變的政策了！新興的後備軍——中國的愛國志士們——加入國民黨。在他們這種反抗日本帝馴主義的鬬爭中，無異的增加了不少的進步份子。具有很大意義的事實，其基礎已經是日益鞏固了。譯自（蘇聯眞理報）</p>
<h3 id="c4">東京灣岸的一個小市鎮 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 企沙通訊　國基</p>
<p>從中華民國全圖上或許不能找得着企沙這個地名，但在廣東省詳細全圖上必定載有企沙兩字的。</p>
<p>自從日本法西斯血腥的魔手伸進華南之後，尤其是最近×人幾次地從這裏登陸而被我擊退的緊張形努下，這個靠近東京灣岸小市鎭的企沙，就惹人注意了。當然的，企沙之所以使人注意，是由於她處在欽廉右冀的防城底最前綫；同時，她在交通上和出產上也佔着重要的地位，在交通上，北可水陸，南有海道走法屬越南，東與北海，圍小等地隔海遙對，西以公路直抵縣，雖然軍事當局爲積抗戰極起見，已經命令加以澈底破壞，但水路仍可暢通自如。在出產上，糧食甚形缺乏。這裏以產魚和鹽爲最大宗，南路及廣西的魚鹽，許多都是由企沙運銷的，在「六一」事變之前，粵省當局曾幾次派技士到此考察，擬築企沙爲漁業港。</p>
<p>去年九月間，日本法西斯的飛機，在這裏丟下四十餘個炸彈，造成了企沙空前的酷劫。過後許多民衆已遷回居住與營業，過了不久，情勢又惡劣了，×兵來侵的情報頻傳，×人燒船的慘劇常常可見。尤其最近，今天×機矗炸，明日×艦砲擊，捕魚旣不得，生意做不成，因此，許多婦孤，商民等便陵續向着內地遷移；還有幾家富翁，他們驚慌太厲害了，紛紛地領取身稅買舟逃亡安南去了。可是，對這種荀且偷安，貪生怕死的懦怯行爲，當地一般民衆不但在言語上幾誚爲「雙料的亡國奴」，而且在行動上也做出有力的表示。記得在一個民衆的會議場中，有人提議把逃往越南的富翁底財產全數「充公」——充作自衞團及訓練壯丁等費用。這提議給予逃亡者的一個當頭棒喝！</p>
<p>企沙這海濱一帶的民眾是很有團結心的，而且也甚爲英勇。自從×艦，×機時常的炮擊矗炸和幾次要在此登陸後，當地民衆感受到了威脅，於是總總響應政府的號召，都參加軍事訓練，武裝組織起來了。</p>
<p>企沙鎭共有人口七千餘，在街居住的約千人左右，原有戶口不下三百家，可惜現在百餘家已經委托鎖頭先生和門神將軍看守了。在街道上行走的人們，不免要發生寂靜，荒凉及恐怖之感！不過，有時還遇見三五天眞的，頑皮的小朋友，在那頹垣斷壁之下，拾紀瓦礫堆裏的碎片，競賽投入炸彈痕裏；一面又張開小嘴髙唱着「菜種落地會生芽，仇恨日久亦生根，沒將×人趕出去，幾多海水洗沒淸這大仇恨……」。</p>
<p>小小的企沙被轟得不成樣了，企沙的形骸在劊子手之下破碎了，可是，企沙民衆的抗×情緒，正如東京灣的裏海水一般。天天都洵湧着，澎湃着，激冲着。</p>
<h3 id="c5">由衡陽到韶關　中國之友在中國（六） <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>五點鐘的時候，李蒙已在窗外呌我，如果不是他用電筒照在坡璃窗上的話，我簡直看不出外面有什麽東西，因爲昨夜下雨，天色顯得特別的昏黑。我答應他就起來了，昨夜根本沒有打開自己的舖蓋，所以起來後，很快地就收集整齊了隨帶的幾樣小行李。這時李精一派來的那個交際副官也來了，我們一行四個人就跳上了警備司令部的黑色包車。在陰沉而潮濕的晨</p>
<p>中出了衡陽城。車子到了湘江旁邊停住了，司機下車去呌醒那個駕馳渡船的老大。我們坐在車上，瞭望江心，可以看見幾個很大的白色柱子，因爲本來的計劃原想在湘汀建立大橋，將粵漢路和湘桂路連接起來的，後來時局關係，路於中途而廢了。雖然，這是不得不如此軍事原因，可是因之粤漢路的車頭就不能拉到湘桂路上來用而事實上湘桂路的確相當感到車頭不够之苦。</p>
<p>渡了湘江很快便到粵漢路車站，這是座相當壯偉的白色水泥建築，雄巍地聳立在平野之上，據說，這建築的屋頂上曾受過敵機一顆炸彈，可是，因爲其質地堅固，故得能始終無恙，我用電筒打上去仔細地視察了一下，果然，有許多玻璃窗皆已震碎。進車站的時候不到七點鐘，站裏睡滿了候車的人，聽說有一部份還是無家可歸的難民，他們只得把車站當作臨時的宿舍。列車要在七點半才離站，外面的風又大。所以我們便溜進車站的辦公室裏去蹲着烤火。這辦公室裏的空氣非常緊張，不斷地有拿着紅緣旗的人進進出出，幾個値夜班的管理員還依然在煥發地一手拿着電話機，一手執着紅鉛筆，他們約略地招呼了我們一下，就埋頭繼續自己的工作了，因爲我有個老鄕孫蔚起兄在此地運輸司令部裏當參謀，所以我便托那位同來的副官，給他一張卡片和兩本救亡日報的十日文萃。表示因爲時間偬促不能去訪。出意料之外，這位詩人軍官竟偕了警備司令部的副官一同推進門來了，他那雙睡眼笑得成爲兩條細綫，原來昨夜他也是値班。當然，所謂「他鄉遇故友」，我們很快活地暢談了起來。「二四列車快要開了！」那位管理員這樣通知我們。出了辦公室之門。在旅客的人叢中擠上了粤漢路上的頭等臥車，此地的一切裝置，比湘桂路上漂亮得多了，房間裏不獨有很講究的床，並且還有皮的沙發椅，而床頭床尾還裝着各種光綫不同的電燈，李蒙夫人說「這眞是戰時的國際列車竟然如此華麗！」我想所謂「戰時」至多也不過是指旅客的情况而言吧了！如果不是親身至此，誰會相信經過一年多狂矗的粵漢路依然還有如此的設備，火車在汽笛聲中，離開了衡陽站，因爲昨夜大家都未睡好，旣然現在有這樣舒適的舖位，自然不肯輕易放過機會，因此，大家便鑽進了潔白的羊毛毯內大睡其覺。</p>
<p>直到十點鐘才起身，氣候甚冷，粵漢路的兩旁俱是高山，遠處的山顚上，迷糊地籠罩着濃厚的烏烟，分不出究竟是霧是雲，北風吹過，他們輕盈地四面浮散，等到烟霧變得稀淡的時候，山顚上似乎已密佈着細雨了，天時的確可以影響人情，朋友們的心境不免有點戚戚然悽凉的感慨。因此，我無意中便吟起「流亡曲」：泣別了白山黑水，走遍了黄河長江，流浪，流浪——李蒙夫婦對於這歌的調子非常熟識，他們說，在重慶，在香港，在雲南，這歌到處流行着，我解釋了這歌的意思給他們聽之後，並且還吿訴他們這歌的第二部是我們海關同人救亡長征團第一次首先在廣州電台播音的，因爲上海淪陷後，我們和這歌的作者劉雪良同來香港，而劉先生就是在這次充滿着流浪情緒的旅途上完成這萬人同唱的名歌的。因此他倆便堅决地許下於未到韶關之前，首先學會流亡曲的願望，接着便是，流浪，逃亡，流浪到那年？逃亡到何方？……爭取中華民族的解放！粵漢路上第二十四號列車的車廂裏便增加不少的浪亡氣氛。火車好像一隻狡猾的山兎不斷地從個這山洞鎖進另一個山洞，粵漢路地形的險要，（尤其是從彬州到樂昌，韶關的一帶），燧道之多，恐非一般人所能想像。日本飛機一年九個月來的轟炸而終究傷害不到一架列車的原因，當然是因爲此地隨處都有着足以保護的燧道。廣州陷落後，×人屢放沿粵漢路北上的謠言而終未見實現之於事實，雖然其最重要的原因還是力量不够，可是地勢的險要，的確也是增多日本軍閥顧慮的原因之一。天色漸漸暗黑了，十八日下午九點多鐘的時候，火車於夜色中馳進了韶關車站。</p>

<p>（二）是宜露國防會講的記錄、要使香港等處汪派進一種搖言、設是（汪家艷電與政府是唱雙簧）有着證據、現在記錄披露、僅使人知道南京會議與汪家艷電並無絲毫因果、但見汪氏自己是一個和戰不定、背寒追煖的人物罷了、且以雙簧論、汪氏歪戴了小帽、面心裏塗着白粉、在台前演手與雙脚、近衛在他屁股頭人唱「新秩序」在氏的手脚應該合節、不啻若自其口出，突然換了蔣先生在他後、痛駁「新秩序」、汪氏就在台前呆若木鷄、手足那僵着不動、這可以叫看雙簧的小弟弟、判斷汪氏與誰演的雙簧、小弟弟必大呼曰、我在告白看的叫做「二衛變簧」、中日合演、只是小問題、我勸汪氏大人物不必注意、若犯了洩露秘密文件的大罪來牽扯成一句趣談、更不值得、</p>
<p>（乙）洩露自身職務地位上所曾的秘密文件、已經够犯罪、又把公家文件隨意添改偽造、適於已意、尤不是要想領袖黎眾者所應做，例如汪氏文下所引導大使又見在部長、「據稱、德國駐日大使在東京曾與日本陸軍外務兩大臣談話、探詢日本是否想結東現在局勢、並問日本政府如欲結束現在局勢、是在何種條件之下、方能結束」這是紀録所無、而你代替×人來掩飾、×人要德國政府來講相的地步、免惹×國的怨恨、又對於排白問題、「祥細辦法係技術問題」記錄亦無、又唐孟瀟、白健生、徐次辰、顧嵐三等談話、記錄亦無之、又「陶大使謂中國抵抗日本、至今已表示抗戰精神、如令已到結束的時機、歐戰時、本有幾次好機會、可以謀和、但終自信自己力量、不肯講和、直至維爾塞條約簽訂時候、任人提出條件、不能不接受……在彼看日本之德國陶大使聲明的、免得機大使在德國受他政府的陶責、喪失我們中國外交信用、睹如此類之竄改尙多、雖皆無關宏要、祇是適於和議之足可推動、然以中樞要人而能如此自由偽造、即使真是一不小心、利令智昏、去充傀儡、你這樣不能忠於職務、豈不是××見了你却會怕、所以不敢要你命嗎、你要小心心、我想到相當時間、一定會給××××××××××、况且在你夫婦已糾台「同志」、××××、亦何以管束其部下、無非以偽相市而已、××××</p>
<p>（丙）汪氏自吹「所誠心誠意以求的、是東亞百年大計、我看透了、並斷定了、中日兩國明明白白、戰爭則兩傷、和平則共存」又云、「明明白白擺在面前、兩國有志之士、難道怵于一時之靦福毀譽、而徘徊膽驗、不是顯然有所取舍嗎」、汪氏居然像煞有偕事、革命兩年、黨魁、雄辯家、詩人、漢奸、搖身一變又變為老敎士、又你的女中豪傑陳夫人、她近來也常常差嘆、戰爭中人民如何痛苦、忘了幫助你在漢口北平鏖戰、儼然一位積世老婆婆、可惜你們夫婦暗中又在那裏慫恿「同志」、不恤小亂、準備組織「中央」希圖竊取政權、作為你向×人進身之質、只人家可就不能不看透你們的假面具、知道你們貓兒哭老鼠、其實可笑、還是勸你們善保引刀成快的少年頭、始終老實為好，</p>
<p>（丁）但汪氏最不相信就是老實他是志氣的要想達到無上的高昂、差不多宇宙如有上帝、他還想駕上帝而上、其實他無論如何能像孫悟空的善變、終變不了那條尾巴、人家看了、祇是一個畜生、他的尾巴到底是什麼呢、是慘線少年「不老的」、是不懂邏輯為何物的雄辯家、是尋章摘句的書生、是也愛幾個奧錢的凡夫、從前我稱他為偽君子、乃是我上了人家的當，什麼黨魁漢妤、都是他們渡暫居的頭銜、終要被人一脚踢開、提了尾巴、再度從極左攀到極右、從極高變到極低、從極香變到極臭、他都無所謂、他自己以為「看透了」馬上為、看透「革命的向左邊來、便覺至少可與列寧托福斯基三位一體、史太林决不是他的對手、他又看透了東亞百年大計、至少希特勒遷至里尼、少壯軍人都要受他的支配、人家說汪精衛早已加入某某集團、他做硬牌××、决不像秦檜李完用那末簡單、所以西湖上秦檜王氏的夫婦、用白鐵鑄成、對于他們夫婦至少要準備鎢鋼才稱他們的分量、不知後事如何、且看他變成了再說、我今感慨的、他既然知道、「主和也不會妨害統一、而不主和也不會不分裂」、難道別人也就見不到、人家答復你、也不過說主戰也不會分裂罷了、誰在那裏借抗戰統一呢、你反對什麼呢、你提出那個反對字樣、不過存心要煽動你的「同志」替×人起一小亂罷了、此時你要在國內煽起小亂、這個搖身的變化、你還吃得了麼、不用鎢鋼候着孝敬你們的、百年後還用什麼呢、中國因抗戰而得到統一、乃是一句共同說順口的新名詞、沒有那個造了這個名詞而抗戰、問起這一名詞的內容、就是說、除了極小數畜類的漢好、中國全體入民、都是愛國份子、我也舉一個例、你所主持過的參政會、就是各黨各派的代表、因抗戰而統一集合、大家想到從前分裂的削弱國力、所以一合就不會再分、所以你也能相信、「主和也不會妨害統一、而不主和也不會不分裂」、統一裏面、又來了共產黨的服從三民主義、擁護國民政府、也共同抗戰、你以為共產黨是以搗亂為天性、你又說、共產黨能「表面化」、但直到如今、却止見你公開乞降、尙不曾見井產黨的公開搗亂、共產黨能表面化、你却連表面也不化、你就是要宣傳你個人和議、你自己的計劃、明白宜布了、就是盼望不得共產黨搗亂、所以你先來做個縱把持挑撥離間的勾當、如果共產黨中了你計來搗亂、你的機會就到了、是真麼、就是你可以借求外援之名義、來借日本兵平內亂了、你這極用心、不是明代的吳三桂、朝鮮的李完用嗎、你倒行逆施、一至於此、你還有絲毫天良麼、你坐在中央黨部、不是一天誰不跟了你、對共產朋友苦口婆心、祝他們表面化得自然、共同建成三民主義的國家呢、你要公開了向×人特別提出、是何居心、你主張了賣國的和議、還有本領使他們表面化、大家同他們共同愛國、就無法得他們表面化、這成什麼邏輯、呢</p>
<p>好了、請你不以搗亂為大性的撫着良心、少看透點、老實做你的頭、能××××的少年、我得罪了你、將來願受你的處罰末了、我也奉還你「舉一個例」、就是你曾記得、你在民國廿三四年做行政院長兼外交部長時代、不是日本軍閥要求撤換察哈爾宋主席哲元嗎、你接到了日本軍閥的要求條件、就不問那一個、也不問怎麼樣、更不問宋哲元主席究竟有什麼過錯、應該不應該撤換、你就拿你誠意的外交、負責的精神、用卓越超羣的見識、高明莫測的手段、趕快連夜的下令、卽將宋主席撤換、你就對日本軍閥俯首貼耳、奉命惟謹的運辦了、不到廿四小時、把我們察哈爾整個的主權、奉交日本軍閥了、而日本軍閥竟不費一彈、不流一血、和平的取得了察哈爾、你看、這與上月哈柴總統奉送捷克國的情形、有什麼兩樣、計算時間、你的高明迅速的外交手段、奉送察哈爾、比捷克的奉送、還要快得多、其他實例、也不知有幾多、我只舉這一個例、已足够表示你汪先生高見卓識聰明智慧的外交天才、向×人能負責任的喪權、很誠意的辱國了、</p>
<p>汪先生、你對日本軍閥這樣的負實、這樣的誠意、日本軍閥那裏還肯舍得了你呢、中國四萬萬五千萬人中間、除了你之外、再也找不出第二個人來了、所以他們找到了王克敏梁鴻志二位還不够、必要對你說、是只有你汪先生、可以做他們的對手、如此、還要餐他們的心、派兵到上海攻南京、直到佔領廣州武漢、汪先生、你知他們這是廿麼、恐怕你還不明白嗎、這就是要等到你出來代國自政府同他們做對手啊、但是他們到了武漢、你還不肯出來做他們對手、你豈眞要他們打到西安南寧之後、你才肯出來推倒國民政府、代國民政府做對手麼、如果他們到了西安南寧、傷亡了許多兵力、化費了好多車費、弄到他們本年度六、萬萬作戰預算經費、用得精光、這時竟攻不下西安南寧、或攻下了、而你如還不出來推倒國民政府、代國民政府來和他做對手、那你汪先生眞是害了他們、眞是對不起他們了、到這時、你的好友日本軍閥、一定要請問你、在你「舉一個例」中的—奠定東亞百年長治久安之局」、與「共同生存共同發達的又一條路」的話、不是騙人麼、你到那時、如恐不能答覆、我替你想、祇要說、「我是中國人、我們打仗、兵不厭詐、我現在如此、你們是失敗了」、可是這才够得上是「東亞百年長治久安之局」「共同生存共同發達的又一條路」啊、這樣覆他、你不是成了一個歷史上有名的大政治家嗎、如果真是這樣的結果、那我們將來的中日戰史上、中華民國得到了獨立自由領土主權行政完整的那一天、豈不是要拿你的第一功記載在第一頁上麼、你還怕什麼有寃洗不清呢、我想、你如要報國揚名、留芳百世、只有如此、還是我老同志為你代想的再好沒有的第一個方法、除此以外、就是這條是死路、請你珍重珍重、切不可定錯、如果弄到一朝失足千古恨的時候、那就追悔也莫及了、再會、（完）</p>

<h3 id="c35">英大使赴渝 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>英駐華大使寇爾氏，已於昨日下午由滬抵港，定於昨晚經河內前往重慶，重慶是目前我國中央政府所在地，故大使此行，原無特別值得注目之處。不過因為最近大使曾在滬與英駐日大使克萊琪會商遠東時局問題，外邸對此且有種種傳說，（如漢奸親日份子之謠傳英將考慮調解中日問題）我們覺得要在道裏略加說　。</p>
<p>大使在不久以前，會親歷我後方各地及湘贛前綫，並曾確切認識我目最高領袖，政府要員，軍事長官，以至各綫抗戰將士和全國人民，都具有不司屈撓的抗日×愾和團結抗職到底的决心，都具有痛切反對日×漢好一切「反共」「和平」「調解」陰謀活動的决心。今日大使經港抵渝，所見所聞，當能更增前此的認識，此種决心是中華民族偉大力量的表現，是中國　取獨立自由與世界相平必獲勝利的保證，同時必將增加大使努力促進中英友誼合作制裁××維護和平的勇氣與决心。</p>
<p>日方對於大使此次赴渝，似乎異常注意，電傳昨日日方各報，並謂「英國現正與法美兩國密切合作，以謀對日加以壓力」。此種宜傳，姑不問其用意如何，但其畏懼中英美法各國合作對日之情，則已溢於言表—×人之所長懼，亦正吾人之所　迎。我　應由此加緊盡力於遠眾反侵略運動的發展，不過這要依靠我們的努力，不是空言空想所能實現的。英駐日大使前日返抵東京時還說：「英國對遠東糾紛所持之政策不致有何變化』，我們就要依據遠東侵略者對英法進一步壓迫的當前事實，澈底粉碎一切妥協政策，促進他們對遠東對援華，採取更積極的步　。</p>
<h3 id="c36">文化食糧問題 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>昨晚大道中某新書局內發見有人竊書該人卽遭　毆，當時目睹者為之憤激。因此想到目前嚴重的文化食糧問題。</p>
<p>知識飢荒是資本主義社會特別是×民地社會上普遍的現象。抗戰以來本港新書業突形發展，雖為「時勢所趨」，但是仍不能不對新書業者的努力表示敬意。不過關於售價，較諸幣與港幣的匯率，似乎還嫌昂貴，對於貧窮的知識飢　者，仍少實際補益。祈望該業能够多多注意及之。</p>
<p>其次，本港圖醫館事業近來已較發達，但不是「門禁」森嚴，使一般沒有學籍沒有保證金的知識飢荒者望館興嘆；便是宜傳不够，一般知識飢荒者還是『莫知所由」！且從全港人口而論，現有的圖書館實在還嫌太少—希望各界熱心人土，多多注意及此，替貧苦的知識飢荒者廣闢知識的倉糜，並且廣泛地推進讀書指導的工作，</p>
<p>此外，本港已負南方文化中心的盛譽，華南各地以至各游擊區各戰區，莫不熱烈地期望着本港文化界，期望我們能够努力供應文化食糧，因此除了供應本地需要以外，還得擴大「運　文化食糧到內地去」的運動。</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>港大與我大學合作正在商討中</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>香港大學是香港的最高學府，港大學生百分之九十以上又是我國的靑年、這就是說明港大學生不僅是香港社會的楝樑，同時亦是祖國所殷切期望着的專材。港大所處的地位，亦可以看出他的重要性了。</p>
<p>港大為要負起這個偉大的使命、切實與我國大學發生聯繫，互相合作、自是今後應走的途徑。配合着中英的　切關係、與和睦的邦交，中英文化携手、亦自是當前的急務。</p>
<p>翁近　督委出中英要員多人，組會進行合作事項，中英庚欵總斡事杭立武氏亦為委員之一，我們認為這是應該重視的一件大事。因為我們除了「自力更生」之外，爭取國際的同精與援助亦是十分需要的；港大過去不够的地方，亦有一個新生的機會了。</p>
<p>上月十六日，本報嘗有特寫報道　港大學與我國大學合作的消息，並提供三點意見作為歡迎杭立武先生的禮物：（一）希望港大將中文列為必修科；（一二）希望港大添聘對於敦睦中英邦交有信心之中籍學者相任較授使與國情相配合；（三）希望港大降低收費以利貧寒子弟之深造。環顧本港文化敎育界對於中英文化携手的展望，亦極關懷。可是，杭氏因病，姗姗來遲，討論合作方案之港大特委會，亦因代表我國之中英庚款總幹事杭立武氏尙未抵步而一再延期開會。直至前天，杭先生始在我們熱烈盼望中由重慶抵港，港大特委會亦開始在會議商討中。昨天，記者遂帶着一片歡迎與希望的誠意訪問杭立武先生去。</p>
<p>鼓起着力氣登上山頂，終於在港大副校長家裏晤見了杭立武先生。是一位和靄可親的中年人，劈頭的話就是：「你們那篇「港大與我大學合作」的特寫已由葉恭綽先生寄給我。貴報的星期論文「莊澤宜先生的高等敎育改革問題」和其他關於溝通中英文化的文章亦閱過，意思都很對。」可知杭先生此來是很重視此間的一般與論，我們誠懇地希望他在表我方，　重地和港大當周妥商，這是中英文化携手的一個重要的關鍵。</p>
<p>寒喧之後，慢慢就掉上本題。鈴鈴鈴的電話却打斷了幾次話頭。</p>
<p>這次，港大為要發展校務，認為有與我國合作的必要，我敎育當局，對於港督——兼正校長——及副校長的開明都表示無限的感佩，對於中英文化合作事，亦甚表興趣。</p>
<p>在從前，我們嘗撥有二十穴萬五千磅的的庚疑充港大的基金。今次商討合作，在港大致我當局文件中却沒有什麼經濟上的要求。至於我當局，則認為如果中英文化合作切實履行，我們再撥疑帮助，却是絕無問題的。</p>
<p>杭先生此來，携有敎育部陳部長對子港大與我合作的方案，要點着重於提高中文程度與造就理工醫人材。至於具體內容，正在與港大妥商中，未便遽爾發表。</p>
<p>總之，港大與我合作的問題，是二個很複雜的問題，不過，在港大賢明的正副校長倡導之下，不難逐漸求其進步就是了。</p>
<p>杭先生還很樂觀地說：『幾年來」我們國內大學程度的提高及各方面的進步是很迅速的。我們希望中英能够携手一同邁進！」這自是我們所樂聽的喜訊</p>
<p>電話不時鈴地　着。杭先生太忙了，記者不敢多所領敎而辭別。</p>
<p>杭先生最近整理文件之後，擬撰「一中英文化展望」的文章在本報發表，我們就此等着領敎。</p>

<p>各國對於　兒童電影片之重視　輔助兒童教育唯一工具</p>
<p>電影已被認為補助兒童敎育的速成工具的一種、所以世界各國、目前對兒童影片巳是非常重視、現把各國對於兒童影片的情形、約略地向讀者報道一下、</p>
<p>美國美國　是電影事業先進的國家、因此、美國的電影敎育、也比任何邦國為進步、美國的學校、現在巳有不少購置映影機、在每一個星期日或節日放映兒童影片，有的由公家收集材料、編成劇本而特攝的、有的由影片公司攝成、專讓學校或敎育機關放映的、就是通常的電影院公映含有兒童敎育意義的影片、凡是兒童進去觀着、每把票價减得非常便宜</p>
<p>英國在傳統上、什麼都帶些守舊色彩的古老的電影當然也不致例外、尤其是對於兒童影片、特別注意，各地的電影檢查會檢查影片的時候、對於片、每一部要冠上A或U一字、A字就是Adult的縮寫、衹准成人，不准兒童觀看的意思、U字是Universal的縮寫、成人與兒童一樣可進去觀看的意思、近年似來英國更由國家設置專管兒童影片的機關、拍攝兒童影片、在各地的公，共機關或學校裏面公映。</p>
<p>德意　德意兩國獨裁國家、對於兒童影片也很重視、但法西斯蒂得勢而後、這兩個邦國、先後把電影事業加以統制、以電影當做了宜傳主義的工具、政治作用重於娛樂意味、所以兒童影片也不是例外、由公家選擇了兒童影片的材料，攝成影片、有的是顯明的、有的是暗示的、把法西斯主義、國社主義、向兒童宜傳、而各電影院、各學校、更時常有這種兒童影片的公映、</p>
<p>蘇聯　蘇聯電影事業的進步、有特殊的神速、是足使任何人表示驚奇的、尤其是對於電影教育、非常注意、單就莫斯科說來、每一個例假的日子、有五百多家電影院、自上午九時起、到下午九時止、輪流公映兒童影片、票價的低廉，為別國所未見、這些影片、包括正片、卡通片、由政府攝製、專門供給八歲以上、十六歲以下的兒童觀看的、在攝製方面、故事的取材、都以兒童為對象、和普通的影片不同。</p>
<p>中國　最後要說的便是我們中國中央電影檢查委員會、對于影片的檢查、並沒有是否適于兒童觀看的標明、國家更沒禁止兒童看某一類影片的法令、但近年以來、對于電影敎育也很注意、單就上海說來、中國電影敎育協會，在上海設有分會、時常把特攝的、或選出的兒童影片、在各中小學輪流免費公映、祗是『八一三」之後、這個機關也跟着國軍西撤、而暫時的撤離了、</p>

<h3 id="c62">甲组联赛冠军决赛　海军點将戰南華　多是人實力未知是強還是弱　南華亦因麥紹漢染疾略有更動 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>〔本報專訊〕是屆足球季、在本月底可結束、足球總會幷警決定廿二日爲舉行甲組聯賽冠軍　與聯隊表演　之期、聯賽冠亞兩軍、刻未解决、尙有待於十五日南華南與海軍之戰、視誰得勝而定、</p>
<p>此幕爭　戰、總會原欲提早於本月初旬舉行、但因不得海軍之　意、蓋海軍以提早舉行、殊不利於己，因為本月初旬、兵艦多出海、健將不齊集故也、</p>
<p>刻下泊港兵艦頗多、故海軍之是球人材、亦因之而增、惟其實力如何、當為心球事者所欲預知、綠南華能否奪標，全視此最後關頭得失、故海軍實力是强是弱、為華成敗所擊也，</p>
<p>據記者　海軍有關係方面調查、得悉其至時應戰陣綫、大致如下所定者、惟細看軍帖、已有健將多員、不在其列、因狄臣、　地等已返英國、故榜上多新人、然其實力如何、則未可預斷、</p>
<p>南華方面、亦因麥紹漢染病、尚須休養、至時決不能上陣、故所擬陣綫、與日前特別銀牌決賽對警察時略同、李國威任左內衛、郭英　充右前衛、至於前鋒一職、則由李恩良擔任、</p>
<p>又總會所定廿二日表演賽、擬增加一場乙組冠軍隊對聯隊、並於賽畢舉行頒獎云、（太歲）</p>

<p>鐵爾登說　業餘網球界</p>
<p>祗有五年壽命　五年後職業化</p>
<p>〔倫敦通訊〕據前溫布爾頓冠軍鐵爾頓氏預測業餘網球祇有五年的壽命了、過此以後、業除和職業選手一起比賽的公開賽、一定會出現的、</p>
<p>「所有偉大的球員、現在亂漸漸的脫　業餘界了」、鐵　頭昨天說、「不久的將來，一定有一天業餘隊裏完全沒有了能吸引觀眾的好手、那時業餘網球界中設有了能護錢的人物、自然公開網球賽就應運面生了，」</p>
<p>鐵氏不久就要到奧林匹亞參加職業比賽、他曾暗示的說、如果業餘方面現在不聽職業球　的話，那將來等到他們求到職業球員與業　球員比賽時、如果遭受職業球員的拒絕、那可就「悔之晚矣」、</p>
<p>但是我們冉看看對方怎樣說、</p>
<p>辛普森氏　指鐵氏恐嚇</p>
<p>目下業餘網球　正在蒸蒸日上</p>
<p>倫敦每日郵報體育記者辛普森氏說、鐵爾頓竟以為我們在五年內就可以向台維斯杯、溫布爾頓等比賽告別、而跑去和職　球員拉手、共同組　公開網球賽</p>
<p>他說的也許會實現——誰能知道五年後事情會變怎麼情形呢、有許多人都異口同聲的說、我們的網球主腦們都不敢承認現實，但是我們却不能就這樣服服貼貼的接受鐵爾頓的恐嚇、雖則現今還是有計多業餘選手受到補助金，但是我們却不能不承認業餘網球正在蒸蒸日上</p>
<p>在業餘網球與、　有預定好了的勝利、在職業網球襄就不同、他常被人思疑、認為有的職業比賽中、常像做戲那樣、排演好了才上場</p>
<p>以博覜眾的興趣和迭成下次比賽成功的機會、像這樣、如果聯業選手也加入到溫布爾頓來，那末綱球行將整個完了，</p>
<p>再者、假設管理方面完全兀准了、業餘選手難道就個個都願意伸手去拿薪水、難道無論那一個地方，那一個選手、都是看錢比天還大嗎，</p>
<p>並且我們怎機能保證職業球員一定能把綱球水準冉提高一點呢、我們又怎知　業網球過了五年後又不烟消雲散、而且世界上像美國那樣富足的地方又有多少、况且就像美國那樣富足的地方、還不過祇有表演賽能够撑一些金錢吧了、所以業餘網球是不是會完全滅亡、這也該仔細的想想、</p>
<p>潘萊語言　澳可獲臺盃</p>
<p>美國主將下野　勝利僅佔半數</p>
<p>合維斯盃。網球大會、本屆已將開始角逐、上屆冠軍美國隊、因主將勃琪業已轉入職業界、故實力大受損失，而此盃寶座之落入誰手、亦頗費猜疑、據紐約電訊云、前英國主將曾運　執惠勃爾登冠軍名將之潘萊、頃在此間國際戶內網球賽時語人云、本年度之台維斯盃主人為誰、此乃極饒興趣之問題、現美國保持台盃之希望、僅祇百分之五十、據金之意、則台盃或將易為澳洲所有、因美國如有勃琪在，則司　得兩分、現勃旣轉入職業、美國之最佳球員為立格斯、而立格斯所持者為其反手抽擊、然澳洲之勃朗維區擅雙手執拍作戰、反手與正手同屬强勁、並無絲毫差別、故立無敗勃之可能、而勝負關鍵、則繫十此、若澳洲能退羣　與美國一决雌雄、則口盃寶座亦有厚望焉、</p>

<h3 id="c73">論藝術的瑣細 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>藝術之本質的特徵，是在於它的典型性，藝術作品之反映客觀現實，不是屑碎地直觀地進行的，它必須透過作家之藝術的概括，從而普普遍化典型化地表現出現實的眞實來，中外古今一切偉大的藝術作家，他們底　術上的勝利，也就是他們底典型創造之勝利，「藝術的力量是在槪括，是在普遍化」，在藝術這一整個的有機體中，我們要想捨割了它的典型性這一個特徵，是完全不可能的。作家的任務。是在於藝術的典型之創造，從藝術的典型之中，深化並擴大人們對於生活與現實的認識，藉以「把人類提高到現實之上」。</p>
<p>藝術必須頭要有它的典型性，這已經是一種確切不移的定論，但是除了典型性之外，或者就是在與型性之中，藝術印仍舊不能舍棄它的細節中的正確，恩格斯在給馬加列特。哈克納斯的信中討論到這一個問題時，會經强調着說：「我以為現實主義下但是表示瑣細。（Detail）的正確，而且表示正確地傳達出典型環境下的典型諸性格」，從恩格斯的這兩句話中，我們可以明顯的看到，在現實主義中。典型性雖然是基本的主要的契機，而藝術的瑣細，却也是一個不能忽略不能缺少的因素，只有在典型的深刻創造與瑣細的正確描寫底有機的配合之中，優秀的偉大的藝術作品，才能够成功。</p>
<p>細——兩是藝術上的一種重要的伏素，雖然它常常為許多機絨的批評家們所看不起或簡直爲地們所反對，但是，它之存在於藝術之中，它之　給藝術以無限的明朗，却是無法否認的。藝術的瑣細，它給典型的創造帶來了非凡的生活上的說服性　形象的健全性和環境的明瞭性，藝術的槪括不僅要求深度，而且還要求各個細節，各個場面札人物等等的形象的聯全性，說服性及明瞭性，這些，只有在藝術的瑣細之正確的　寫中才能獲得，才能保有，因此藝術的瑣細就成為一個藝術作家創作時候所不能疎略的東西，高爾基在他底一我的文學修養」一書中，會幾次三番的從自己底初期文學經驗裏面指出他寫作時候對於瑣細上的描寫之錯誤，並且說，『這種錯誤，好像不關緊要，其實卻有很大的意義，因為這種錯誤，會破壞藝術的眞實性」，於此足見藝術的瑣細在藝術全體中的意義之重要。</p>
<p>藝術的瑣細，能够給與藝術作品和藝術典型以强烈的色彩，把新鮮，明朗，生活力和獨創性，賦與於活現的故事和生朝的人物，蕭洛機夫在『靜靜的頓河中，很巧的用利了種種瑣細的霍描寫，使他底整個的藝術的成果上面，明顯的劃上了濃烈的顏色，給人以一種特列深刻的印象，這是他的一種偉大的成功。藝術的細　的正確性，足以加强藝術的力量，使藝術的典型獲得新鮮的標識，由於藝術的瑣細，形象的健全性，生活的說服性，與環境的明瞭性才能完成，而藝術才能獲得它底充分的感人的威力，為着使藝術的作品，更能要揮積極的作用，為着使藝術更加得到偉大的成功，作家必須在藝術瑣細的描寫上，多下功夫，多作努力，從藝術的瑣細之眞實性的表現中，强調現實的眞實底鮮明的彩色。</p>
<p>然而我們必須注意的，就是藝術的瑣細並不等於蕪雜，對於那各個細節，場而，人物以及情景等等的瑣細的描寫，並不是要作家毫無抉擇地把各個細節，無秩序而又無澄濾地胡亂堆砌到作品上去，形象的藝術件不是需要簡單的瑣細，而是需要正確的秩序的瑣細，必須是這樣的瑣細才能使藝術獲得它的特殊性，明瞭性與說服性。為此，藝術的瑣細，無論任何一個細節場面，人物或情景，都需要是可質的，典型的東西，對於整個的藝術作品，它必須成為不可缺的，特別的一面。當一個作家要描寫種特殊的生活現象，假使他需要借助於藝術的瓊細，藉以强調其生活的色彩，那他一定要從它自己所需要方面，選取最能明白地表現其現象之最特貧的細節，給以組織，給以排列，從而使之放為他底藝術中底有機的一部。</p>
<p>藝術的瑣細，雖然是藝術　成底一個重要的因素，但它是不能離開藝術的典型而獨立的，沒有了藝術的瑣細，固然足以使典型失去了鮮明的姿態與强烈的彩色，但是假使不是立於典型創造的基礎之上來提起藝術的瑣細，那它就完全失却其存在終是基本的主要的，藝術的瑣細，只是襯托　附從的，只有在加强典型，深化典型，　配典型前提之下，藝　的瑣細才有它存在的基礎，它的任務，是從各個特殊的細節中，渲染創造那一般的典型，所以，藝術的瑣細就是藝術的槪括之橋樑，是藝術從特殊到一般的道路。傳僅是瑣細，還不是一切，也不是一件藝術的作品，倘使有人把瑣細作爲藝術的根本內容，那無疑是使獻術低降了，或者說是藝術破壞了，因為單單只描寫客觀現實之瑣細的非本質的側面，並不區別現實中之附萬的東西與主要的側面，從而去肓目地模寫生活與現實的表面，是無法把握現實的中心與生活的全熊的，盲目的模寫，瑣細的堆陳，是只有表現出作家以及藝術作品的虛弱無力而已！</p>
<p>一定要在典型的創造的觀點之上來看藝術的瑣細我們才能理解其根本的意義。</p>

<h3 id="c75">潮安鱗爪 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 新丁</p>
<p>潮安這個地方是一個帶有封建殘留色彩的縣城。最旺盛的最長的路叫做太平路，好比廣州的惠愛路，漢民路，好比香港的彌敦道，上海街，然而它却沒有什麼洋化的氣味，反之却還帶有很濃？的封建意味，沿路有許多座皇帝時代的牌樓，「聖日」的扁額依然俘在，兩傍的商店一律平過沒有什麼特色，但住戶却還有許多是紅一門橋；前面有金字或金色的八封圖樣，年老的婦人還有束褲脚，纏足，穿電袖長袍的，在這樣的路上走着，彷彿置身舊小說裏面的世界。路上的車輛很少，只一些洋車和脚踏車，偶然倒也有一兩架流線型的汽車經過，那是「達官實人」從韶關來的，車身有黃的泥獎濺上的花的花紋點綴着。</p>
<p>三月的春天裏，該是「毛毛雨」的時候了，路上建築不是拱形而是平面的，所以雨水不會自己流去，弄得路上泥濘難行。無聯獨自回旅店，叫「伙計」冲了茶來，原來茶杯是，小酒杯那麼小大，據說這裏吃茶慣常是如此，如果大杯喝，那是不够『斯文』的。全個縣城沒有一間　樓，不，這裏也有茶樓，不過不是給人們一品茗」而是吃飯喝酒的，食物都很貴，普通中等飯店的菜色，每個五六角以至一元（多已改用國幣　，下級的則每位包飯也要二角大洋。米呢，近來潮汕一帶大鬧米荒，每元只買九筒——約摸六斤左右，直接影響着大多數平民的生活。</p>
<p>大街上沒有什麼戰時的氣息，標語和口號，壁報等通通沒有。我獨自走到縣民敎館去看看，一所大的庭園裏面，一間間的陳列室，可是都封閉着，塵埃和蛛網佈滿，裏面陳列的動植物標本都很紊亂地而且殘缺不完，也沒有民眾來參觀，又沒人員在管理，門口只有一工人在修葺　格，這情形是很蕭條，也很沉悶的，可是從報紙上看，潮安的救亡運動是很熱烈的。這幾天正在進行着出征軍人家屬慰問，籌備着「三，廿九」黃花節的擴大紀念，各社團——黨政文化的聯合座談會等。</p>
<p>潮安民眾愛好音樂，所以這裏所出產的樂器都很著名。只要每天兩頓飯不成問題，問餘的時間喜歡拉拉椰胡（用椰殼製的胡琴），彈彈秦琴，有一次我　到郊外虹橋一帶遊逛，那寫風景很不錯，有開得燦爛的紅棉，狹長的池塘邊第有山榭，兩傍植着絲絲的楊柳，在一個一小山崗　托之下，　出是一　個天然的公園。在這左近的一所菜園的茅會裏，我聽到潮安流行的樂曲，可是這些樂曲都是靡靡之音，照廣東俗語可以說「聽到耳油都出」，但决鼓不起激昂的情緒。這種「潮汕音樂」之所以很能吸引人，照我的管見，就是它能利用柔和的旋律，與及和聲配合得適當的原故。在娛樂昇平的太平盛世，人民安居樂業之餘，悠然地聽一曲，其滋味是不下于有閒階級的淡巴菇和巧克力；而于火藥味濃厚的今天，而且潮安已成為廣東東路的要地。一般民眾還沉浸在柔娓聲色之中，這是須要大大地改革的，希望潮汕的救亡同志，積極提倡能够鼓舞，激發，煽動的抗×歌曲，一掃頹廢萎靡的風習！</p>

<p>『工作？哼，就是殺人的工作嗎？』她怕這强硬的話，引起對方强硬的反響，便停了一下，愼重地注意着對方，因為對方仍握着她生命之鎖的鑰匙。她旣不敢嚴厲地反抗，又不甘心輕易地　從，結果，祇有把自己的一切聰明，用之於嘲謔了，勉强地帶着强硬的口吻，又問了一句：『難道別人的墳墓，就是你工作的基礎嗎？』</p>

<h3 id="e1">European Situation and the Far East <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since Italy forcefully occupied Albania and pressed towards Greece, the situation in Central and Southern Europe has suddenly become very tense. On one hand, Germany and Italy seem inclined to actively invade and annex small countries in Central and Southern Europe in a coordinated manner. On the other hand, Britain and France are also busy preparing for active resistance. According to a report by the Associated Press today, "The British and French fleets have received secret orders from their governments to control key military points and are now concentrating in the Mediterranean." It is also reported that Britain is preparing to acquire Corfu through diplomatic means as a naval base to resist Italy. Britain has also notified Italy: "Any act of invading Greek territory, whether ports or islands, will provoke war." However, Italy not only shows no sign of backing down but also appears to be actively collaborating with Germany for larger-scale military operations. The situation in Central and Southern Europe can be said to be extremely tense, with the possibility of conflict erupting at any moment.</p>
<p>In this situation, the attitude of the British government is of course the first thing to note. Although Chamberlain has repeatedly warned Italy and reached a consensus with France to concentrate the navies of both countries at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea, Chamberlain's current approach still consists of trying to seek compromise with Mussolini, even to the point of recognizing Italy's annexation of Albania. News from London reports how Britain is supposedly being proactive and issuing warnings to Italy, but on the other hand, the British Foreign Office denies "the government has warned Italy not to invade Corfu and stated that such an action would lead to war." This is Britain's consistent attitude of showing weakness to German and Italian aggressors. No wonder "Le Petit Parisien" predicts that Britain will "not go so far as to declare the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 16, 1938, invalid."</p>
<p>What we should emphasize is that for Britain to actively adopt methods to resist the powerful, all countries, large and small, in Central and Southern Europe, even all countries, whether in the East or West, that are being invaded or are upholding peace, must genuinely unite to resist the aggressors in a collective security manner. Action must be active, and the scale must be broad. The current situation is already quite mature. Not only have all the small countries sincerely accepted Britain's guarantees and mutual assistance agreements, but some countries have also expressed willingness to join the European peace front. It is reported that Chamberlain will announce to the House of Commons on Thursday that "Greece and Turkey have joined the European peace front," which undoubtedly shows that collective action in Central and Southern Europe to resist aggression is becoming increasingly mature. Here, one point that Britain and France should pay attention to in organizing this anti-aggression front is that the participation of the Soviet Union has enormous power. The news reported from London, "Britain and France are now conducting closer cooperation with the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries," is a very good trend. We also hope that Britain and France can make this effort more active and not harbor expectations regarding Italy's actions. Britain and France must understand that the Soviet Union has already earnestly sought to unite with Turkey. The result of this union is sufficient to control the Black Sea and the Dardanelles Strait, posing a great obstacle to Germany and Italy's eastward advance. At the same time, the Soviet Union and Greece are also seeking military cooperation. If this plan succeeds, even if Romania and Poland are unwilling to connect, their strength will be sufficient to resist the joint actions of Italy and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Amidst the tense situation in Europe, the war in the Far East is also becoming increasingly urgent. On the one hand, the Japanese army is actively reinforcing troops in various parts of North, Central, and South China, attempting to actively attack us. But on the other hand, our army's preparations on all fronts have also been completed, and counterattacks have been launched, with considerable progress in military operations on various fronts. Today, when the situation in Europe is tense, it is a natural tendency for Japan to actively attack China. However, the point that should be brought to the attention of all countries opposing aggression is that the actions of the world's aggressors are consistent. Although Japan's elder statesmen, senior officials, and even some influential figures in the financial world oppose further expansion of military operations, the fanatical young military officers are precisely trying to use this good opportunity to expand their plans and suppress domestic anti-war sentiments and actions. Regarding this major trend, we hope that Britain, the United States, and France will not forget this Eastern aggressor taking advantage of the situation to loot. It is faintly heard that Britain has decided to prepare for a powerful counterattack against Japan's aggression. It is also heard that the United States will discuss the issue of prohibiting the sale of arms to Japan in the House of Representatives and is considering providing loans to our country to aid the war of resistance as much as possible. Even regarding the Neutrality Act, some members of Congress have proposed amendments because the act is unfavorable to China. In any case, Britain and the United States should take more active action against Japan. Only when countries committed to peace in the East and West take active action and cooperate effectively can they have the practical effect of preventing aggression.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Path to Victory in the War of Resistance Opened Up by Chinese Youth <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— By J. Gordan, translated by Mei Zhen</p>
<p>In China, the most noteworthy thing in the past few months is the increasing solidarity of all parties and factions, and the establishment of a fundamentally proactive and victorious foundation for the war of resistance on all fronts nationwide. In this unity and victorious development of the war of resistance, Chinese young students have exerted tremendous power.</p>
<p>When Wang Jingwei exposed his true colors in December last year, betrayed the motherland, advocated surrendering to Japanese militarism, and sued for peace with the Japanese government, he did not receive any support in all of China. Although he was once one of the highest leaders of the Kuomintang and the chairman of the Central Political Committee, only a very small number of isolated individuals ran away with him. The Chinese people and youth unanimously condemned this traitorous action. Within a few days of his defection, news of Wang Jingwei's expulsion from the Kuomintang spread immediately, and military leaders across the country jointly signed and issued a declaration denouncing Wang Jingwei as a traitor and demanding severe punishment. The leader of the Chinese government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, also issued a statement to the public within a few days, expressing his determination to persevere in unity and resist aggression to the end. Tens of thousands of resolutions from all sectors of the Chinese people poured into Chongqing like an angry tide, unanimously condemning Wang Jingwei, expressing support for the central government, and resolving to continue the war of resistance. Various youth and student organizations in China expressed their support for this policy of resistance and passed resolutions demanding Wang Jingwei's arrest.</p>
<p>Since Wang Jingwei left the motherland, the internal political unity of China has greatly developed. Because when Wang Jingwei was still in the country, he and his henchmen constantly engaged in secret conspiracies, provoking conflicts between various parties, especially between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At the same time, he also used various methods to provoke conflicts between the people and the government, causing the people to abandon the national policy of resisting aggression. But after Wang Jingwei defected from China, the power of this kind of activity has been greatly weakened. Now, the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is closer than before. They have also established a joint committee. At the same time, the unity of the Chinese youth movement has also been strengthened. For example, the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League established by the government in June last year initially had restrictions in its constitution on members of other parties and factions joining, but now, any young person, regardless of party or faction, can freely join the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League. (The Communist Party resolved at the Sixth Plenary Session not to recruit members and develop organizations within the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League of the Kuomintang - translator's note)</p>
<p>This unity and significance of the war of resistance was clearly expressed at the Fifth Plenary Session held in Chongqing in late January of this year (1939). At this meeting, Chairman Chiang said:</p>
<p>"The Chinese people must continue to resist aggression until final victory. The frustration of Japan's military plans, the failure of its policy of establishing a puppet regime, and the deterioration of the domestic situation all clearly indicate the collapse of Japan's adventure in China. China will never compromise or make concessions!"</p>
<p>At the end of the Fifth Plenary Session, a message to the people of the whole country was issued, encouraging the people to persevere in the war of resistance and commending the heroic achievements of the soldiers on the front lines across the country. It also passed a bill to step up economic construction in the western provinces and issued a declaration stating that the unity of the Chinese people, the unity of purpose, and the bravery of the soldiers are the foundation for China's final victory. The Fifth Plenary Session advanced an important step on the road to unity and resistance. Youths and students across the country again supported this meeting with demonstrations and resolutions.</p>
<p>Due to the strengthening of China's internal unity, the past two months, from a military point of view, have become months of victory in the war of resistance. Since the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, the Japanese army has not advanced; in many places, they have retreated. The Chinese army in Shanxi, under the leadership of the Eighth Route Army, launched a general counterattack at the beginning of January this year and recovered several important places. (The areas of Daning, Jile, Pu County, etc., in the Lvliang Mountains were recovered. Following the smashing of the Japanese army's eight-pronged attack on the Jin-Cha-Ji border region and the attack on northwestern Shanxi in December last year, the Japanese army's attack on western Shanxi was also crushed. Now, the Japanese army's attack on southern Shanxi towards the Zhongtiao Mountains is encountering a disastrous defeat under the heroic resistance of the Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi army - translator's note) This means that Japan's long-planned plan to cross the Yellow River to attack Shaanxi has not yet begun to be implemented.</p>
<p>In the first week of February, Chinese guerrillas destroyed a total of thirty-eight Japanese army locomotives, one hundred and forty-eight various types of military vehicles, three thousand and nine hundred meters of railways, and fourteen bridge piers, and killed eight hundred Japanese soldiers. These figures are only the result of one week of battles along the Pinghan Railway in North China. In the past two months, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has also been repeatedly cut off. Guerrilla forces in Shandong, Henan, and Anhui have all achieved important victories. They fought a total of two hundred and fifty-six battles, killing twelve thousand five hundred Japanese soldiers and seizing two hundred and fourteen machine guns and three thousand six hundred and fifty rifles. In Guangdong Province, the battles are still taking place around Guangzhou. Although the Japanese army has sent a large number of reinforcements, it has not been able to make significant progress.</p>
<p>The Japanese air force, based in Hankou, constantly carries out cruel bombings against Chinese civilians and undefended cities as retaliation for the Chinese people's resistance to Japan. Several small cities in Guangdong have been bombed thirty-six times in fourteen days. In the bombing of Wanxian, Sichuan Province, last week, one thousand people died tragically. Chongqing, the temporary capital of China, has also suffered severely. But this random destruction and slaughter by the Japanese army only serves to strengthen the anger and will to resist aggression of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>In the heroic war of resistance, Chinese youth and students have played a significant role. Whether on the front lines or in the rear, they are doing educational and relief work. The work of popular education carried out by youth and student organizations is developing. For example, six hundred literacy classes for the common people have recently been opened in Chongqing. They hope to eliminate illiteracy in Chongqing by the end of 1939. An educational boat, carrying various educational supplies, books, maps, films, wireless radios, singing groups, and theatrical troupes, etc., is run by youths and students, traveling back and forth in the rivers of the mountains, conducting extensive propaganda and education work.</p>
<p>On the front lines and in the guerrilla areas, Chinese youths are doing a lot of heroic work. In the Eighth Route Army, in the Fifth Route Army, in the New Fourth Army, and in other central armies, the achievements of youth in serving the war of resistance are especially admired by all parties. In Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, and the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, youths are stepping up military training. At the Anti-Japanese University in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, there are a total of fifty thousand youths waiting to enroll. There, tens of thousands of students are receiving training in guerrilla warfare, the popular united front, and international knowledge. The number of students reporting to the National Military Academy is so large that it is difficult for the school authorities to choose. A new military school has also been established in the so-called occupied areas of Shanxi, Chahar, and Hebei (located in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region - ××××××), giving youths three months of guerrilla training.</p>
<p>In recent months, China's war of resistance has been developing victoriously, and unity has been strengthened. The Japanese authorities, who used to boast that they could conquer China in eight to ten months, are now forced to shout the necessity of a protracted war, "either ten years or twenty years." In this struggle to lead China to final victory, Chinese youths have shouldered the most important task.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Growing New China <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— By Saiga Mirof, translated by Yi Chou</p>
<p>China’s war of liberation against foreign invaders has entered its second stage. Under the pressure of the superior mechanized forces of the × people, Guangzhou and Hankou have fallen. The Japanese’s ultimate attempt to weaken the main force of the Chinese army is to adopt an encircling strategy on the front along the Yellow River, but this has met with complete failure. The strength of the Chinese army has not only been preserved but has also become more intelligent in terms of combat. To be sure, the Chinese army now has almost two hundred and forty divisions, each with ten thousand soldiers. This is a significant increase compared to the beginning of the war. Each soldier in the Chinese army has improved in war technology. If it is said that at the beginning of the first phase, the losses of the Chinese army were in a ratio of three to one, then at the end of the first phase, it was in a ratio of one to one. As for the battles in the second phase, it is as General Chiang Kai-shek said: “The Chinese army, according to the quality of its own war, each Chinese soldier will be equal to three dispirited Japanese soldiers.”</p>
<p>The extension of the front line is four thousand miles. This has caused Japan to face a very serious offensive strategy. Therefore, their movements have to be called changes. Once the Japanese army penetrates into the mountainous areas, it loses the possibility of simultaneously attacking with its army, navy, air force, and mechanized units. When the Chinese army prepares to implement a counterattack, the Japanese army will inevitably be forced to abandon its excessively dispersed parts and shrink to its main strongholds and transportation lines.</p>
<p>In preparation for “resistance to the end,” China has rapidly planned to develop its economic base in the western and southwestern provinces. Many highways have been built in Sichuan Province. According to a report in the "North China Daily News": In January of this year, the construction of railways has begun in various parts of southwestern China. The first railway line will reach the border of Burma. This railway is of great significance to the Chinese economy; at the same time, it makes it possible for the supply of foreign military supplies to be imported into China.</p>
<p>The establishment of Chinese industry usually focused on the coastal areas. Now, the industries in the mainland of China have all been moved to western China. Many enterprises in the coastal provinces have been destroyed by Japan; however, the Chinese government has relocated many of the more important factories to the deep interior.</p>
<p>From the development of industry, many “inexhaustible” resources have also been discovered. Sichuan Province has a large amount of coal deposits, estimated at over 100 million tons. The coal mined in 1939 will reach over 2 million tons; while in 1938, only 1 million tons were mined. West of Chongqing, there are two counties called Weiyuan and Ziliujing, where there are very rich oil deposits.</p>
<p>There is also a county called Qijiang, where iron ore has been found, and 4 million tons of iron can be obtained every month. Copper mines have also begun to be found in western Sichuan; at the same time, gold mines have also been discovered. Over three hundred enterprises have been moved from other provinces. Most have already started work, and there is also a slightly larger chemical factory moved from Tianjin.</p>
<p>Guizhou, the neighboring province of Sichuan, is the largest source of sugar for Sichuan Province. Its animal husbandry is also quite developed, possessing many abundant natural resources of various kinds: steel, iron, coal, and water-resistant mineral resources. These mines have begun to be mined. In addition, gold mines have been discovered in twenty counties. Road construction is also quite developed. Currently, almost one hundred thousand workers are building roads paved with crushed stone. In the future, these roads will be converted into railways. There is also a long crushed stone road connecting Chongqing and Kunming.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Xikang, the newly established province, is also the best area for developing industry and has abundant water sources. There is a railway from Ya'an to Kangding. This railway is also being built by one hundred thousand people. A railway is also being prepared from Lubian to Yunnan. This railway passes through Xichang and directly to Huili—a place where iron, coal, lead, silver, and other mines are stored. It is a large industrial area in western China.</p>
<p>This is the resources and foundation that New China is preparing for a long-term war for the independence and freedom of its country.</p>
<p>In nineteen months of war, Japanese invaders have occupied nine of China’s twenty-eight provinces. Although, of these seven hundred and ninety-six counties, only fifty-nine are under Japanese control. The remaining four hundred and eighty-nine counties are still under the jurisdiction of the Central Government of China.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are determined to fight the foreign invaders for “final victory.” This principle has been clearly indicated by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Not only has the unity of the military and the people been strengthened, but the foundation for permanent cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has also been consolidated.</p>
<p>Fighting for the independence of their country, the heroic Chinese people have raised their political activities to an unlimited extent at this time. The broad masses of the people are constantly expressing their own political tendencies within the Kuomintang. It is difficult for general compromisers to adhere to their policies of surrender and betrayal! The emerging reserve army - Chinese patriots - joined the Kuomintang. In their struggle against Japanese imperialism, it has undoubtedly increased the number of progressive elements. Facts of great significance, its foundation has been increasingly consolidated.

<h3 id="e4">A Small Town on the Coast of Tokyo Bay <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Communication from Qisha, Guo Ji</p>
<p>Perhaps the name "Qisha" cannot be found on the full map of the Republic of China, but the detailed full map of Guangdong Province must contain the two characters for "Qisha."</p>
<p>Since the bloody clutches of Japanese fascists extended into South China, especially under the tense situation of the × people landing here several times recently and being repelled by us, Qisha, this small town near the coast of Tokyo Bay, has attracted attention. Of course, Qisha's ability to attract attention is because it is located on the front line of Fangcheng at the right wing of Qinlian; at the same time, it also occupies an important position in transportation and production. In terms of transportation, it can be accessed by both water and land to the north, and by sea to French Vietnam to the south. It faces Beihai and Weizhou Island across the sea to the east, and can be reached directly to the county by road to the west. Although the military authorities have ordered it to be thoroughly destroyed for the sake of the war of resistance, the waterway can still be freely accessible. In terms of production, food is very scarce. The largest products here are fish and salt. Many fish and salt from Nanlu and Guangxi are transported and sold through Qisha. Before the "June 1st" incident, the Guangdong Provincial Government had sent technicians here several times to conduct inspections, intending to build Qisha into a fishing port.</p>
<p>In September last year, Japanese fascist aircraft dropped more than forty bombs here, creating an unprecedented disaster in Qisha. Afterwards, many people had moved back to live and do business, but after a short time, the situation deteriorated again. Reports of × soldiers invading were frequently reported, and the tragedy of × people burning boats was often seen. Especially recently, × planes bombarding today, × ships shelling tomorrow, fishing is not possible, business cannot be done. Therefore, many widows and orphans, merchants, etc. have continued to move towards the interior; there are also several wealthy people who were too panicked and have taken their body taxes and bought boats to flee to Annam. However, for this kind of opportunistic, cowardly behavior of greed for life and fear of death, the local people not only verbally ridiculed them as "double-dealing traitors," but also took strong action. I remember at a meeting of the masses, someone proposed to "confiscate" all the property of the wealthy who fled to Vietnam - to be used for the expenses of the Self-Defense Corps and the training of strong men. This proposal gave the fugitives a head-on blow!</p>
<p>The people in the coastal area of Qisha have a great sense of unity and are very brave. Since × ships and × aircraft often shelled and bombed, and wanted to land here several times, the local people felt the threat, so they all responded to the government's call and participated in military training and armed organization.</p>
<p>The town of Qisha has a total population of over seven thousand, with about one thousand people living on the street. There were no less than three hundred households, but unfortunately, more than one hundred households have now entrusted Mr. Lockhead and General Menshen to guard them. People walking on the streets cannot help but feel a sense of silence, desolation, and terror! However, sometimes you still encounter three or five innocent, naughty children picking up fragments in the rubble piles under the ruined walls, competing to throw them into the bomb marks; at the same time, they open their mouths and sing loudly, "Vegetable seeds fall to the ground and will germinate, hatred will also take root after a long time, if the × people are not driven out, how much seawater will not wash away this great hatred..."</p>
<p>The small Qisha has been bombed beyond recognition, the body of Qisha has been broken under the executioner, but the anti-× emotions of the people of Qisha are like the seawater inside Tokyo Bay. Every day they are surging, surging, and rushing.</p>
<h3 id="e5">From Hengyang to Shaoguan: A Friend of China in China (6) <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>At five o'clock, Li Meng was already calling me outside the window. If he hadn't shone a flashlight on the glass window, I wouldn't have been able to see anything outside at all, because it rained last night and the sky looked particularly dark. I answered him and got up. I didn't even bother to open my bedding last night, so after getting up, I quickly packed up the few small items of luggage I had brought with me. At this time, the liaison officer sent by Li Jingyi also arrived, and the four of us jumped into the black car of the Garrison Headquarters. We left Hengyang City in the gloomy and damp morning. The car stopped next to the Xiang River, and the driver got out of the car to wake up the old man who drove the ferry. Sitting in the car, we looked out at the center of the river and could see several large white pillars, because the original plan was to build a large bridge in Xiangting to connect the Yuehan Railway and the Xianggui Railway, but later, due to the situation, the road was abandoned halfway. Although this was a military reason that had to be done, as a result, the Yuehan Railway locomotive could not be pulled to the Xianggui Railway, and in fact, the Xianggui Railway did feel a considerable shortage of locomotives.</p>
<p>After crossing the Xiang River, we quickly arrived at the Yuehan Railway Station, which is a rather magnificent white cement building, towering majestically on the plain. It is said that the roof of this building was hit by a bomb from an enemy plane, but because of its solid texture, it has always been safe and sound. I shone my flashlight on it and carefully inspected it, and sure enough, many of the glass windows had been shattered. When we entered the station, it was not yet seven o'clock, and the station was full of people waiting for the train. It is said that some of them were homeless refugees, and they had to use the station as a temporary dormitory. The train was not scheduled to leave until 7:30, and the wind outside was strong. So we sneaked into the station's office to squat and warm ourselves by the fire. The atmosphere in the office was very tense, with people holding red-edged flags constantly going in and out. Several administrators on the night shift were still radiating energy, holding a telephone in one hand and a red pencil in the other. They greeted us briefly and then buried themselves in their work. Because I had an old friend, Sun Weiqi, working as a staff officer in the Transportation Headquarters here, I asked the liaison officer who came with me to give him a card and two copies of the Ten-Day Literary Extracts from the National Salvation Daily, expressing that I couldn't visit him because of the rush of time. Unexpectedly, this poet-soldier actually came in with the liaison officer of the Garrison Headquarters. His sleepy eyes smiled into two thin lines, because he was also on duty last night. Of course, as the saying goes, "meeting an old friend in a foreign land," we chatted happily. "The No. 24 train is about to leave!" the administrator informed us. We left the office and squeezed through the crowd of passengers onto the first-class sleeper car on the Yuehan Railway. Everything here was much more beautiful than on the Xianggui Railway. The rooms not only had very elaborate beds, but also leather sofas, and various lights with different brightness were installed at the head and foot of the beds. Mrs. Li Meng said, "This is really a wartime international train, so luxurious!" I thought that "wartime" at most only referred to the situation of the passengers! If I hadn't come here myself, who would have believed that the Yuehan Railway, after more than a year of crazy bombing, still had such facilities. The train, amidst the sound of the whistle, left Hengyang Station. Because everyone hadn't slept well last night, now that there were such comfortable berths, they naturally didn't want to easily let go of the opportunity, so everyone burrowed into the clean white woolen blankets and slept soundly.</p>
<p>I didn't get up until ten o'clock. The weather was very cold. Both sides of the Yuehan Railway were high mountains. In the distance, the mountain peaks were vaguely shrouded in thick black smoke, making it impossible to tell whether it was fog or clouds. The north wind blew, and they floated lightly in all directions. By the time the smoke became thin, it seemed that the mountain peaks were already covered with drizzle. The weather can indeed affect people's feelings, and my friends couldn't help but feel a bit sad and desolate. Therefore, I unintentionally began to recite the "Wandering Song": "Tearfully bid farewell to the white mountains and black waters, traveled all over the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, wandering, wandering..." Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng were very familiar with the tune of this song. They said that in Chongqing, in Hong Kong, in Yunnan, this song was popular everywhere. After I explained the meaning of this song to them, I also told them that the second part of this song was first broadcast on Guangzhou Radio by our Customs National Salvation Long March Team. Because after the fall of Shanghai, we came to Hong Kong with the author of this song, Liu Xueliang, and Mr. Liu completed this famous song that everyone sang on this journey full of wandering emotions. Therefore, the two of them resolutely made a wish to learn the Wandering Song before arriving in Shaoguan, followed by, wandering, fleeing, how many years will we wander until? Where will we flee to?…Strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation! The carriage of the No. 24 train on the Yuehan Railway added a lot of wandering atmosphere. The train seemed like a cunning mountain hare, constantly burrowing from one tunnel into another. The treacherous terrain of the Yuehan Railway (especially from Binzhou to Lechang, Shaoguan), the number of tunnels, is probably beyond the imagination of ordinary people. The reason why Japanese planes have been bombing for nine months a year and ultimately cannot damage a single train is of course because there are tunnels everywhere here that are sufficient to protect it. After the fall of Guangzhou, the × people repeatedly spread rumors that they would advance north along the Yuehan Railway, but it never materialized. Although the most important reason was still a lack of strength, the treacherous terrain was indeed one of the reasons that increased the concerns of the Japanese warlords. The sky gradually darkened. At more than nine o'clock on the evening of the eighteenth, the train sped into Shaoguan Station in the night.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Glorious Record of the Southern Battlefield: The Battle of Annihilation in Northern Guangdong; Successful Assault on the Guangzhou Outer Perimeter Line: A Conversation with a Certain Officer of Our Army <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 12th Dispatch] Since the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, our army has suddenly launched an attack near Conghua in the past ten days and will obtain extremely valuable combat results. This battle is actually a pivot for turning defeat into victory in the combat process in the southern battlefield. A reporter specially rushed to the front line in a certain place the other day, visited a certain officer, and sincerely extended congratulations, and also expressed condolences to the officers and soldiers on the front line. The officer humbly declined and said that this battle was only a small trial. Thanks to the guidance of the superiors and the courage of the comrades-in-arms, we were able to kill × and achieve results and destroy the fierce flames, which is really a great fortune. When the reporter asked about the process of our army's dispatch, the officer showed the maps since the battle and pointed them out diligently. It turned out that our military authorities had been planning carefully for several months. Taking advantage of the ×'s westward invasion of Jiangmen and Xinhui, they assigned a small unit to launch an attack on the outposts of the Guangzhou outer perimeter line. × were caught off guard. Although they were extremely tough and the 18th Division, 17th Regiment, and Abe's unit and Koga's unit fought back on the east and west banks of the Conghua Beijiang River, the army fought bravely for more than 100 hours. Therefore, they were able to complete the task, defeat the stubborn ×. In the battle of Shiqianshi on the 7th, we lured and surrounded more than 2,000 × in a certain area and carried out an annihilation battle with the spirit of brave and fearless attack, killing dozens of high-ranking officers such as Battalion Commander Mori Taro of the 17th Regiment, and capturing Shibuya Riichiro and other officers and soldiers. 23 people, the casualties of the soldiers have not yet been calculated, and a large number of light and heavy machine guns, horses, documents, and various weapons, ammunition, and luggage were seized and are being cleared up. The officer specifically pointed out that during the battle between our ×, the × only held their superior firepower and did not have the courage of the "meat bomb" attack in the Russo-Japanese War. When our army handed in the ×'s equipment, they all knelt on the ground and offered their guns to beg for life, and what we can be proud of is the love of our army towards the prisoners. The wounded are treated, and the hungry are given food, as if forgetting that they were our × people dozens of hours ago. It can be seen that the political education of our army has achieved great results, so that they can still abide by the humanitarianism of the supreme commander and treat the prisoners favorably amidst extreme excitement of feelings.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Macau, 12th Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, Japanese sailors attempted to land at Tangjiawan, 20 miles north of Macau, but were unsuccessful, with about 12 people killed. According to female refugees, after the Chinese army withdrew to the west, the Japanese army looted ×× in Jiangmen. It is heard that the Japanese army is now working hard to restore commerce and develop Jiangmen, so they are trying their best to persuade residents to go there.</p>
<h3 id="e8">One Week of Battle Situation, April 6th to April 12th — Announced by the Military Affairs Commission — <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Our army took advantage of the remnants of the previous week's annihilation of × to exert strong pressure on the ×. The fierce battles were extremely intense. After the heavy casualties, the × were exhausted and defeated repeatedly. Famous cities and important strongholds have been repeatedly recovered. As of the time of reporting, this trend of victory in the north and south battlefields is actively unfolding.</p>
<p>Guangdong Area: More than 1,000 × from Zengcheng have been using fierce artillery fire for days to attack Pingfengling and Huluding in two routes in the east. After a brave counterattack, they have been defeated one by one, killing more than half of the ×. The county town has now been tightly surrounded. The × have made several attempts to break through unsuccessfully. More than 2,000 × from Conghua attacked Dawo Lang and Aotouxu in the morning and noon of the 6th. After flanking attacks on both sides, the ×'s connections were cut off. By the evening of the 8th, the entire line of × had collapsed, with more than 600 casualties. In the battle of Aotouxu, Battalion Commander Mori of the × Lin Division was shot and killed. ×'s panic is extreme. Along the Yuehan Railway, Xin Street, Dalang, and Guanyao were captured in succession on the 6th. Although the × have joined forces to counterattack for months, there have been no results. On both sides of the West River, the Xinhui Jiangmen area is still in a state of mixed war. The strongholds of Makou, Xinxu, and Dagang have all been captured one after another. More than 300 ×'s bodies were abandoned there. The remaining × are now continuing to be mopped up. More than 1,000 × troops and more than 20 tanks from Hainan Island launched repeated attacks on Anliang and Huangzhu in Ding'an County on the 7th and 8th. Our officers and soldiers waited for work and attacked head-on, killing more than 400 × and destroying 6 tanks. At the same time, another part of our army also took advantage of the situation to recover Ding'an City. After this major blow, ×'s ferocity was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Area: More than 2,000 × facing Tang in Nanchang, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on us starting on the evening of the 6th. Our army bravely fought back, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat. After a fierce battle for a day and a night, the position remained unshaken. We launched a counterattack at dawn on the 8th. The × collapsed in panic and fled north to Nanchang. We recovered the area. Gaotan County was also captured at the same time. The × retreated to Fengxin. After we took advantage of the victory to pursue them, Dacheng was recaptured. Meanwhile, we used powerful troops to pursue Fengxin. The entire line of × was shaken and fled one after another. On the afternoon of the 10th, × launched a large-scale reinforcement and counterattack. The battle situation was fierce. Because of the disparity in strength, our army in Gaoan still shifted to the original position to besiege the ×. The × suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle, and bodies were piled up like mountains. More than 7,000 × troops, more than 30 artillery pieces, and more than 30 aircraft from Wuning have been attacking us for days. An extremely tragic battle for was occurred in the Yantang Street area west of the city.</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan Areas: In Hubei Province, our attacking troops have achieved three major victories this week. Our army advancing west in eastern Hubei, after fierce battles for three days on the 6th, 7th and 8th, successively captured Luwangcheng, Hua'erqiao, Wenkouzhen, and Wangjiadian, and are now continuing to advance south, encircling and annihilating the remaining × in Huang'an City. The vanguard of the army advancing north to attack Ying Mountain and Anlu, after recovering Haojiawan and Gongdian, the × trapped in the county town have become alarmed. They are now retreating to Huayuan and Xiaogan. Our army in central Hubei besieged Tiexiang, adopting a four-way pincer attack. On the 7th, they captured Xiaojiadian east of the city. On the 8th, they captured Xinei west of the city. On the 9th, they captured Yangzi Town north of the city. On the 11th, they captured the strongholds of Yuxinhe south of the city. The × stubbornly defended the isolated city, resisting fiercely. Our army braved the ×'s artillery fire and poison gas and bravely fought and killed. At noon on the 9th, they once attacked Beidou, killing countless ×. Because the three routes in eastern Hubei, northern Hubei, and central Hubei captured key points in succession, the × in Wuhan were extremely shocked and are now strengthening their fortifications, trying to put up a desperate fight. There have been no major changes in the battle situation in the Yueyang area of northern Hunan. The × on Junshan Island on the north bank of Dongting Lake were attacked by our troops on the 7th. The × stubbornly resisted relying on their dangerous position. They were finally captured on the morning of the 8th. The remnants of the enemy fled to Wulipai.</p>
<p>Shanxi Area: After the × invading the Zhongtiao Mountains from Anyi, Liancheng, and Yuxiang in southern Shanxi were defeated by us last week, more than 1,000 remnants of the × at Zhangdian Town resumed their activities on the 8th. Our army rushed to Zhen Dong and launched a fierce attack. The × abandoned more than 200 bodies and retreated. More than 4,000 × from Pingyao Jiexiu Lingshi in eastern Shanxi, accompanied by many artillery pieces and tanks, attacked Wanghe and Wangtaozhen (south of Pingyao) on the 11th. Our army bravely launched an attack, and after fierce battles for several days, wiped out a large number of ×. On the morning of the 8th, part of the × army had twice infiltrated Wanghe, but after a fierce counterattack, the ×'s attack was greatly frustrated. They are now facing off at Wangtao Shimen Zhenjie Wangfeng Village. More than 3,000 × from Huoxian did not retreat after invading Yangjiazhuang last week. This week, they continued to attack east with the same strength. After a week of bloody battle, the × have completely failed and their sacrifices have been extremely heavy, and the attack has been frustrated. A part of the × between Ningwu and Shenchi in northern Shanxi was subjected to a sudden and fierce attack by our army on the 9th, and the × were surrounded. The × stubbornly resisted to the death. After a fierce battle for three hours, most of them were wiped out. More than 100 remnants of the × collapsed and retreated to Ningwu. We are now pursuing them in victory and have pressed close to Ningwu City.</p>
<p>Other Areas: In addition, more than 3,000 × from Xinyang in the border area of Henan divided into three routes on the 8th, one crossing the river from Xi Bianhe, one heading to Yangliuhe, and one approaching the Zhe River and trying to break through west. A fierce battle broke out with our army attacking Xinyang. The battle was particularly fierce in the Yangliu River area. Our army attacked in separate directions and broke through the ×'s line. The encirclement continued to shrink. It will not be difficult to capture the desperate remnants of the ×. Near Kaifeng, our army suddenly attacked on the city walls with a large force at about 1:00 a.m. on the 11th, completely occupying the various key points and military stations in the suburbs of the city. The × stubbornly resisted the city. Then our army entered the city and the ×'s deaths and injuries were countless. The remnants of the × abandoned their equipment and fled. The county town was once recovered by us. Fierce battles are still ongoing. The × at Jintan Shenshui in southern Jiangsu suddenly increased to more than 5,000 on the 6th, with more than 70 tanks. On the 7th and 8th, they launched fierce attacks from Tianwang Temple and Lishui Road. Our army blocked them at Shennan and north of Xinqiao. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented in the past month. Our vanguard bypassed the ×'s rear and cut off their retreat. The × were attacked from the front and rear, abandoning bodies all over the field. Another part of our army attacked Yixing's × in surprise. The × were caught off guard and collapsed and fled. We will capture Yi and recover it.</p>

<p>[Chongqing, April 11th, Central News Agency] A Tokyo dispatch states that Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, after returning to Japan from Shanghai, made a special statement. He stated that his trip to China had no special mission and that Britain's Far East policy remains unchanged.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, arrived in Hong Kong on the Taiyuan vessel from Shanghai. He arrived at 10:00 AM yesterday and immediately went to Government House for rest. A reporter from the Dalu News Agency visited him, but the Ambassador, due to travel fatigue, sent his secretary to meet the reporter. According to the secretary, the Ambassador's purpose in going to Chongqing is to meet with Chinese authorities. The details of the meeting between Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen and Ambassador Craigie in Shanghai cannot be disclosed, but the discussions concerned the Far East situation. It is reported that Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen was hosted for lunch at Government House by the Governor of Hong Kong yesterday afternoon.

<p>[New York, April 11th, Central News Agency] Regarding the war situation between China and Japan, the New York Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao published an editorial stating that the Japanese army's offensive against Hunan Province has clearly been hindered. If Chinese troops launch counter-offensives on multiple fronts, they can defeat the Japanese army in various lines and points they occupy in China. According to foreign military observers, if the Japanese army concentrates mechanized equipment to cover the advance of infantry, it can achieve its goals. Conversely, if the Japanese army's artillery and aircraft cannot exert their powerful firepower, and there are no large tank corps to cover them, they will not be able to effectively advance. The military authorities of that country have also gained painful experience and know that if the Japanese army engages in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops, these Chinese troops, whether they are coolies or students, cannot be defeated by the Japanese army. Judging by this, if Chinese troops launch counter-offensives on more than ten fronts, the advantage of the Japanese army's mechanized equipment will be broken by the Chinese army. In addition, with the guerrillas disrupting the Japanese army's communication lines, the Japanese fantasy of exploiting China's resources will be destroyed. In short, the Japanese adventure in China will enter a critical juncture within a few weeks, it can be asserted.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Wu Zhihui Writes an Article Strongly Denouncing Wang Jingwei (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(2) It is appropriate to disclose the records of the National Defense Conference to expose the rumors spread by Wang's faction in Hong Kong and elsewhere, claiming that Wang's declaration and the government were colluding in a double act. With the evidence revealed in the records, it is clear that the Nanjing meeting and Wang's declaration had no causal relationship whatsoever. It only reveals that Wang himself is a person who wavers between war and peace, seeking warmth from the cold. Moreover, in terms of a double act, Wang is wearing his hat askew, with white powder on his face, performing with his hands and feet on stage. Konoe is singing "New Order" behind his buttocks. Wang's hands and feet should move in sync, as if the words were coming from his own mouth. Suddenly, Mr. Chiang replaces him, vehemently refuting the "New Order." Wang remains frozen on stage, his hands and feet stiff and motionless. This allows the little brother watching the double act to judge with whom Wang is performing the double act. The little brother will exclaim, "What I am seeing is called 'Two Wei Change Yellow'," a joint performance by China and Japan, only a minor matter. I advise Wang, a big figure, not to pay attention. It would be even more unworthy to turn a major crime of leaking secret documents into a humorous anecdote.</p>
<p>(B) Leaking secret documents that he had access to by virtue of his position and status is already a crime. Furthermore, arbitrarily adding and altering public documents to suit his own purposes is not something that a leader should do. For example, in Wang's article, he quotes, "According to reports, the German Ambassador to Japan spoke with the Japanese Army and Foreign Ministers in Tokyo, inquiring whether Japan wanted to end the current situation, and asking under what conditions the Japanese government would be willing to end the current situation." This is not in the records, and you are trying to cover up for the Japanese to avoid the resentment of the country. As for the issue of excluding Bai Jian, the records also do not contain "The detailed method is a technical problem." Furthermore, the conversations of Tang Mengxiao, Bai Jiansheng, Xu Cichen, and Gu Lan are also not in the records. Also, "Ambassador Tao said that China's resistance to Japan has shown the spirit of resistance. If it has reached the time to end the war, there were several good opportunities during the European war to seek peace, but ultimately we were confident in our own strength and refused to negotiate. Until the Treaty of Versailles was signed, we had to accept whatever conditions were presented…" In his view, Ambassador Tao of Germany made the statement to avoid Ambassador Ji being blamed by his government in Germany, losing our Chinese diplomatic credibility. There are many such alterations, though none of them are major. They only serve to promote the idea of peace talks. However, for a key figure in the central government to be able to fabricate so freely, even if it is truly unintentional, driven by self-interest, and acting as a puppet, if you are so disloyal to your duties, wouldn't you be afraid that would ××××××××××. Moreover, your husband and wife have already colluded with 'comrades' in Taiwan, so how can you control your subordinates? It's nothing more than using falsehoods to deceive. ××××</p>
<p>(C) Wang boasted, "What I sincerely seek is a grand plan for East Asia for a hundred years. I have seen through it and determined that war between China and Japan will harm both sides, while peace will lead to coexistence." He also said, "It is clearly laid out before us. Can those with ambitions in both countries hesitate and be timid in the face of temporary shame and praise? Isn't it obvious what should be chosen?" Wang is acting as if he knows everything. A revolutionary for two years, party leader, orator, poet, traitor, he has transformed into an old clergyman. And your heroic wife, Madam Chen, has recently been sighing about how much suffering the people are enduring in the war, forgetting that she helped you fight fiercely in Hankou and Peiping, looking every bit like an ancient old woman. It is a pity that you and your wife are secretly instigating "comrades" to create small disturbances, preparing to organize a "central government" and attempting to seize power as a way to advance yourselves with the Japanese. People cannot help but see through your masks and know that you are shedding crocodile tears. It is actually laughable. I still advise you to take good care of your youthful heads, which are prone to being beheaded, and remain honest in the end.</p>
<p>(D) But what Wang does not believe in is honesty. He is determined to achieve supreme heights. He almost believes that if there is a God in the universe, he wants to rise above God. In reality, no matter how much he can transform like Sun Wukong, he can never change that tail. When people see it, they just see an animal. What is his tail after all? It is the tragic "unaging" youth, the orator who does not understand logic, the scholar who seeks out chapters and sentences, the ordinary man who also loves a few coins. I used to call him a hypocrite, but I was fooled. What party leader and traitor are just temporary titles for them. Eventually, they will be kicked away and raised by the tail, climbing from the extreme left to the extreme right, from the extreme high to the extreme low, from the extreme fragrant to the extreme stinky. He doesn't care. He himself thinks that he "has seen through it" and will immediately act. He has seen through that "the revolution comes from the left side" and feels that he can at least become one with Lenin and Trotsky. Stalin is definitely not his match. He has also seen through the grand plan for East Asia for a hundred years. At least Hitler will move to Lini, and young soldiers will be under his control. People say that Wang Jingwei has long joined a certain group, and he is doing hard ××, definitely not as simple as Qin Hui and Li Wan Yong. Therefore, the statues of Qin Hui and Madam Wang by West Lake are made of white iron. For them, at least tungsten steel should be prepared to match their weight. I don't know what will happen later, so let's see how he transforms again. I am now lamenting that since he knows that "advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not prevent division," how can others not see this? People are only responding to you by saying that advocating war will not cause division. Who is using resistance to unify here? What are you opposing? You are only trying to incite your "comrades" to create small disturbances for the Japanese. At this time, you want to stir up small disturbances in the country. Can you handle this transformation? You don't need tungsten steel waiting to pay respects to you. What will you use after a hundred years? China's unification through resistance is a new term that everyone says readily. No one created this term to resist the war. When asked about the content of this term, it means that apart from a very small number of traitorous animals, all Chinese people are patriots. I will also give an example: the National Political Consultative Council that you presided over is a united gathering of representatives from all parties and factions due to the war of resistance. Everyone realized that division weakens national power, so once they unite, they will not divide again. Therefore, you can also believe that "advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not prevent division." Within unification, there is also the Communist Party's obedience to the Three Principles of the People and support for the National Government, also jointly resisting the war. You think that the Communist Party is inherently disruptive. You also say that the Communist Party can "become public," but until now, we have only seen you publicly surrender. We have not yet seen the Communist Party publicly causing trouble. The Communist Party can become public, but you cannot even become public. You just want to promote your personal peace talks, your own plan, clearly announced. You are hoping that the Communist Party will not cause trouble. So you first come to do the work of manipulating, holding, and sowing discord. If the Communist Party falls for your trick and causes trouble, your opportunity will come, is that so? That is, you can use the name of seeking foreign aid to borrow Japanese troops to quell internal chaos. Isn't your extreme effort like Wu Sangui of the Ming Dynasty or Li Wan Yong of Korea? Your perverse actions have gone so far. Do you still have any conscience? You sit in the Central Party Headquarters, and isn't there anyone who doesn't follow you every day, earnestly advising your Communist friends to naturally become public and jointly build a country based on the Three Principles of the People? What is your intention in openly proposing this to the Japanese? You advocate treasonous peace talks, and you still have the ability to make them public. Everyone can work with them to love the country together, and they cannot become public. What kind of logic is this?</p>
<p>Alright, please, without being disruptive, put your hand on your conscience, see through less, and honestly do your job. A youthful man who can be ××××, I have offended you, and I am willing to be punished by you in the future. Finally, I will also return to you "give an example," that is, do you remember that when you were the President of the Executive Yuan and Foreign Minister in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China, didn't the Japanese warlords demand the removal of Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province? You received the demands of the Japanese warlords, and without asking anyone, without asking how, and without even asking what mistakes Chairman Song Zheyuan had made or whether he should be removed, you immediately used your sincere diplomacy, responsible spirit, outstanding vision, and unfathomable methods to quickly issue an order overnight to remove Chairman Song. You bowed down to the Japanese warlords, obeyed their orders, and handed over the entire sovereignty of Chahar Province to the Japanese warlords. The Japanese warlords did not spend a bullet or shed a drop of blood and peacefully acquired Chahar. Look, what is the difference between this and President Hacha of last month handing over the Czech Republic? Calculating the time, your brilliant and swift diplomatic methods to hand over Chahar were even faster than the handing over of the Czech Republic. There are probably many other examples. I will only give this one example, which is enough to show Mr. Wang's far-sighted, insightful, intelligent, and wise diplomatic genius, responsible to the Japanese, and sincerely humiliating the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, because of your responsibility and sincerity towards the Japanese warlords, how could the Japanese warlords be willing to let you go? Among the 450 million people in China, there is no one else to be found except you. So they found Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi, but they were still not enough. They had to say to you that only Mr. Wang could be their opponent. So, they still have to break their hearts, send troops to Shanghai to attack Nanjing, and even occupy Guangzhou and Wuhan. Mr. Wang, do you know what they are doing? Are you afraid you still don't understand? This is to wait for you to come out and replace the National Government as their opponent! But they have arrived in Wuhan, and you are still unwilling to come out to be their opponent. Do you really want them to fight to Xi'an and Nanning before you are willing to overthrow the National Government and replace it as their opponent? If they reach Xi'an and Nanning, lose many troops, and spend a lot of travel expenses, using up their budget, and can't take Xi'an or Nanning. And if you still don't come out to overthrow the National Government and replace it as their opponent, then Mr. Wang, you will really hurt them, and you will really be sorry for them. At this time, your good friend, the Japanese warlords, will definitely ask you, in your "give an example"— "laying a foundation for a century of long-term stability in East Asia" and "another path of common survival and common development"—aren't you cheating people? If you are afraid that you cannot answer by that time, I will think for you. Just say, "I am Chinese. In war, there is no room for deceit. I am like this now, and you have failed." But this is enough to be "a century of long-term stability in East Asia" and "another path of common survival and common development." Answering them like this, wouldn't you become a famous politician in history? If this is really the result, then in our future Sino-Japanese war history, on the day that the Republic of China achieves independence, freedom, territorial sovereignty, and administrative integrity, wouldn't your first contribution be recorded on the first page? What are you still afraid of having injustices that cannot be cleared? I think if you want to serve the country, make a name for yourself, and leave a good name for posterity, only this is possible. It is still the best method that your old comrade has thought of for you. Apart from this, this is a dead end. Please cherish it and never make a mistake. If you slip up and regret it for eternity, it will be too late. Goodbye. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e20">European Situation About to Unfold: Britain to Express Attitude Today, Fleet Simultaneously Concentrated in the Mediterranean <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 12th) After receiving secret orders, the British and French fleets are concentrating in the Mediterranean. According to senior government officials, concrete measures have been drafted stipulating that if Bulgaria, with or without Italian assistance, invades Romania or Greece, Turkey should attack Bulgaria. It is estimated that the French cabinet has ordered 400,000 reservists to be called up, not including the 650,000 standing army. The King's sudden return to London to hear Prime Minister Chamberlain's report is reminiscent of the events of last September when the King returned to London specifically to sign the fleet mobilization order during a period of heightened European tension.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Skopje, 1st) According to reliable sources in Greece, several British warships are now stationed in the ports of Argostoli and Astakos.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Marseille, 10th) The French Mediterranean fleet was ordered today to depart from Toulon and head to a certain location in the Mediterranean. This action by the French fleet is a precautionary measure taken by the French cabinet. Details of the French fleet's movements have not yet been reported.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Paris, 11th) The French government has ordered the summoning of naval experts and the cancellation of all leaves for naval officers and soldiers. The French fleet in Toulon is prepared to sail to North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. Easter leave for army personnel has also been cancelled.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Rome, 11th) Italian authorities announced today that reservists from the 1901, 1912, and 1917 classes have been fully called up. A portion of the 1918 and 1919 classes have also been ordered to assemble. Officials stated that if the situation does not drastically change, Italian authorities will not call up any more reservists. It is noted that the currently mobilized troops have reached one million.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Rome, 12th) Mussolini, according to an official Fascist statement issued today, declared that if the overall situation does not worsen, Italy is prepared to mobilize no more troops. However, the statement warned that if Britain and France do not take similar measures, Italy will implement a large-scale mobilization.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Paris, 11th) Poland has mobilized as many as six classes of reservists, with those enlisted being between 22 and 28 years old.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 11th) It is reported that the British and French fleets are currently concentrating off the Adriatic Sea. Chamberlain is making a final effort to negotiate with Mussolini. Chamberlain's plan is to recognize Italy's annexation of Albania in exchange for Italy's guarantee not to attack Greece and to promptly withdraw Italian troops from Spain. It is generally believed that if Chamberlain's negotiations with Mussolini fail, the Prime Minister will announce in the House of Commons at 4:25 PM on the 13th (10:00 PM Hong Kong time) that Britain will adopt close military cooperation with Turkey and Greece. It is also predicted that the government will renounce the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Meanwhile, the Admiralty refuses to release information on the fleet's movements.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 12th) The British Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee met all day today to study the overall situation, preparing for Prime Minister Chamberlain to announce Britain's attitude towards guarantees to Turkey and Greece in the House of Commons on the 13th. It is believed that the Foreign Affairs Committee will continue discussions tomorrow morning to determine the content of the statement and hopes to obtain final reports from Athens and Ankara. It is generally believed that Chamberlain's statement will provide a clear exposition of the current situation in the Mediterranean. At the same time, there is hope here that Mussolini's declaration promising the immediate withdrawal of Italian troops from Spain can be obtained within 24 hours.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 12th) The French cabinet ministers unanimously passed the declaration drafted by Daladier today, which will be announced tomorrow in the name of the French government. The declaration will clarify France's attitude towards the current European situation.</p>
<p>Italy Guarantees Greece's Territorial Integrity</p>
<p>Rome Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Announcement: British, American, French, and Soviet Talks</p>
<p>(Reuters, Rome, 12th) The Foreign Ministry here issued a communiqué today stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had previously unequivocally guaranteed the territorial integrity of Greece. Italy has now received a letter from the President of Greece expressing gratitude for this guarantee. The Greek President believes that the development of the situation in recent days has made long-term friendship and peace between Italy and Greece possible.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Athens, 11th) It has been learned that Greece has reached a specific understanding with Britain, promising that Greek ports can be fully used by the British fleet in wartime, and Britain is also providing Greece with certain benefits. It is reported that Greece has not allowed assistance to Britain in the event of an attack on Britain, but is willing to cooperate closely with Britain if Greek territory is threatened or war breaks out in the Mediterranean region. The British side has guaranteed to supply Greece with 300 aircraft, a number of anti-aircraft guns, and one million gas masks. It is also reported that Italy is currently consolidating its position in the Adriatic Sea to avoid external attacks. In the past three days, 300,000 experts and specialized workers have been sent to Vlora to build strong fortifications. There are rumors that Italian authorities have transported 250 heavy artillery pieces to Vlora. The entire defense of Vlora Bay is extremely strong, especially the Two Sassino Forts, which control the entire Vlora area. It is said that Italian artillery fire can control the narrow entrance to the Adriatic Sea, not only destroying the Yugoslav navy but also hindering any foreign fleet activity.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Rome, 11th) According to Italian sources, Italy considers any British assistance to Greece an act of hostility against Italy and a danger that could alter the status quo in the Mediterranean. They said that Italy is concerned about Britain's actions towards Greece. Mussolini's mouthpiece newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" published today that Italy is planning to enlist Albanian soldiers into the Italian army.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 11th) The British Foreign Secretary held talks with the Soviet Ambassador today to inquire about the Soviet Union's attitude towards the overall situation.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 12th) The French Foreign Minister met with the Soviet Ambassador yesterday. Prime Minister Daladier also met with the American Ambassador.</p>
<p>British Parliament to Reconvene Today</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary to Report on International Situation, Chamberlain to See the King</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 11th) The House of Lords will convene at 3:00 PM on the 13th, at which time Foreign Secretary Halifax will answer questions from Lord Snell, in which he will address the international situation, especially regarding the Mediterranean region.

The King suddenly returned to London from Windsor Palace today during the Easter holiday and will meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain at Buckingham Palace. Afterwards, he may return to Windsor Palace.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 11th) Chamberlain's audience with the King lasted 80 minutes. The Prime Minister then returned to Downing Street at 6:20 PM, where he was welcomed by the waiting crowd. The King immediately returned to Windsor Palace. The King's sudden return to London was to hear information on the progress of the European situation and to avoid Chamberlain having to travel to Windsor.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Washington, 11th) Secretary of State Hull met with British Ambassador Lord Lothian this afternoon to discuss the international situation.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 12th) "The Times" today wrote an article titled "An Unquiet Europe," and "The Daily News" published an article titled "A Tense Europe," both pointing out that alarming reports accompanied by international tensions have become the new diplomatic technique of aggressor nations. "The Times" specifically noted the importance of President Roosevelt's essay in "The Washington Daily News," saying that "President Roosevelt may have issued the most direct warning that the threat to Western culture is necessarily related to the United States." The opinions of the White House and the State Department clearly represent the views of the majority of Americans.</p>

<p>(Associated Press, London, 12th) After repeated efforts at appeasement failed, Prime Minister Chamberlain and his cabinet are now adopting a tougher stance. However, diplomatic circles are now quite skeptical as to whether this stance is too late. The fate of the Balkan Peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean is truly uncertain. Romania is now the focus of attention. The Romanian government has notified the British government in a manner akin to an ultimatum that if Britain cannot decide to take military assistance measures towards Romania within this week, then Romania may surrender to Germany, as the Romanian Foreign Minister is scheduled to arrive in Berlin next Monday to meet with Hitler and the Foreign Minister. The Romanian Ambassador to Britain has been constantly urging Foreign Secretary Halifax to pay attention to the perilous situation in Romania since returning here last Thursday. According to recent reports, 300,000 Hungarian troops have concentrated on the Romanian Transylvanian border, and 100,000 Bulgarian troops are stationed on the Romanian Dobruja border.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Yugoslav Capital, 11th) Responsible parties here indicate that Yugoslavia will follow the lead of Britain and France. It is generally believed that if Britain and France do not provide assistance, Yugoslavia's limited position will lead to a grim future. At the same time, 700 Albanians are now here preparing to participate in the anti-Italian war.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Bulgarian Capital, 11th) It has been learned that Britain is currently making a final effort to bring Bulgaria into the Balkan Group to oppose the German-Italian axis. According to diplomatic circles, this activity has not been very successful so far.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Washington, 12th) President Roosevelt has approved the international raw material exchange plan proposed by Senator Byrnes. Under this plan, the United States will exchange wheat and cotton with foreign countries for rubber and tinplate.</p>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 11th) Business circles here are very interested in the international raw material exchange plan proposed by Senator Byrnes and are awaiting details of the plan. There has been no criticism of the plan, which appears to have been approved by Congress, especially by senators from cotton-producing regions, who believe that it would be very beneficial if cotton could be traded with foreign countries at market prices. It is heard that relevant officials will leave to discuss this plan, and the result will be the export of 1 million bales of cotton in exchange for about 60,000 tons of rubber.</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Great Engineering of the Burma Road: British Reporter Praises the Road, the Burma Railway is Under Construction <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 12th) The Chinese Government Purchasing Committee recently completed an order worth £180,000 with British merchants to purchase various building materials for the Yunnan-Burma Railway (which is now being urgently constructed). Several other orders are under negotiation. The route of the road is based on the recommendations of a British engineer 40 years ago. A "Times" reporter recently traveled by car along the Lashio-Kunming Highway and wrote an article praising the "Great Achievements of Chinese Engineers." From Lashio to the Sino-Burmese border is 124 miles, and from the border to Kunming is 648 miles. The Chinese section, from Xiaguan to the border, is 367 miles, and construction began in October 1937. That section's terrain is rugged, with steep slopes, whose heights range from 2,000 feet to 6,000 feet. However, it was completed in just 14 months, which is truly astonishing. The most difficult part of the entire road is the section from Longling to the Lujiang River Basin, which must cross obstacles of 8,000-foot-high mountains, with extremely steep slopes and almost unbuildable bends. At the same time, the valleys are 2,000 feet deep, and the terrain is extremely dangerous. The Chinese government has turned to unlimited engineering in this area, striving for perfection. However, due to terrain conditions, landslides often occur. There is also a suspension bridge, 280 feet long, that crosses the Lujiang River, which was recently completed. It is now being upgraded to allow it to carry heavy military vehicles. According to the reporter, if traffic is to be carried during the rainy season, adequate culverts must be placed at the bottom of the road to drain accumulated water. However, in any case, the accomplishments of Chinese engineers cannot be buried. Anyone who has been to Yunnan cannot help but deeply admire the determination and courage of the Chinese.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e35">British Ambassador to Chongqing <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived in Hong Kong yesterday afternoon from Shanghai and is scheduled to travel to Chongqing via Hanoi last night. Chongqing is currently the location of the Chinese central government, so there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the ambassador's trip. However, because the ambassador recently met in Shanghai with the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to discuss the Far Eastern situation, and there have been various rumors about this meeting (such as pro-Japanese traitors spreading rumors that Britain is considering mediating the Sino-Japanese conflict), we feel it is necessary to add a brief explanation.</p>
<p>The ambassador personally visited various places in our rear areas and the front lines of Hunan and Jiangxi not long ago and has a clear understanding that our highest leader, government officials, military commanders, and all the soldiers fighting on the front lines and the people throughout the country all have an unyielding determination to resist Japan and a resolve to unite and resist aggression to the end. They also have a strong determination to oppose all "anti-communist," "peace," and "mediation" conspiracies by Japan and its collaborators. Today, as the ambassador arrives in Chongqing via Hong Kong, what he sees and hears will further enhance his previous understanding. This determination is a manifestation of the great strength of the Chinese nation and a guarantee that China will surely achieve independence and freedom and win a victory equal to that of the world. At the same time, it will surely increase the ambassador's courage and determination to strive to promote Sino-British friendship and cooperation, to restrain aggression, and to safeguard peace.</p>
<p>The Japanese seem to be paying unusual attention to the ambassador's trip to Chongqing. News agencies reported yesterday that the Japanese newspapers stated that "Britain is now working closely with France and the United States to put pressure on Japan." Regardless of the intent of this propaganda, their fear of cooperation between China, Britain, the United States, and France against Japan is already evident – what the enemy fears is precisely what we should welcome. We should use this to step up our efforts to develop the anti-aggression movement in the Far East, but this depends on our efforts and cannot be achieved by empty words and fantasies. When the British Ambassador to Japan returned to Tokyo the other day, he also said: "Britain's policy towards the Far Eastern dispute will not change in any way." We must, based on the current facts of further oppression of Britain and France by the Far Eastern aggressors, completely shatter all compromise policies and promote them to take more active steps in the Far East to aid China.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Cultural Food Crisis <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Last night, someone was discovered stealing books in a bookstore on Avenue Central. The person was immediately beaten, causing outrage among the onlookers. This incident led to thoughts about the current serious issue of cultural sustenance.</p>
<p>Knowledge famine is a common phenomenon in capitalist societies, especially in colonial societies. Since the war, the Hong Kong new book industry has experienced a sudden surge in development, which, although a "result of the times," still merits respect for the efforts of the new book industry operators. However, in terms of pricing, compared to the exchange rate between the national currency and the Hong Kong dollar, it still seems expensive, providing little practical benefit to the impoverished and knowledge-starved. It is hoped that the industry can pay more attention to this aspect.</p>
<p>Secondly, the library business in Hong Kong has become more developed recently, but either the "strict access" makes those without student status or guarantee money sigh outside the library, or the publicity is insufficient, leaving the knowledge-starved still "unsure of how to proceed"! Moreover, considering the entire population of Hong Kong, the existing libraries are still too few—it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will pay more attention to this, opening up granaries of knowledge for the poor and knowledge-starved, and extensively promoting reading guidance work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hong Kong has already earned the reputation of being the cultural center of the South. All parts of South China, as well as the guerrilla and war zones, are eagerly expecting Hong Kong's cultural circles to make efforts to supply cultural sustenance. Therefore, in addition to meeting local needs, the movement to "transport cultural sustenance to the mainland" must be expanded.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Siyi Refugees Will Become Starved Corpses! Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Launch Large-Scale Fundraising Campaign. Street Donation Teams Established Yesterday to Vigorously Solicit Donations. Provincial Government Approves 300,000 Piculs of Imported Rice to Be Shipped to Siyi. <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Siyi General Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting yesterday at 2:30 PM to elect new officers and discuss the relief of war refugees in the region. Attendees included Huang Yueqiao, Zhu Ren'an, Liang Yuanzhao, Li Zizhen, Cen Xiehe, Zhou Xingchi, Chen Liquan, Wu Yaoyun, Zhou Daozhuang, Huang Jingshuo, Liu Ziqing, Gao Liangqing, Qu Zesen, Ma Guoying, Yu Zhuosheng, Liu Yuyun, Wu Yuhan, Zhong Jieqing, Kuang Xiankuan, Chen Zhudian, Jin Rangli, Wu Yueting, Zhang Lanzhou, Liang Shikuang, and dozens of others. The election results were: Chairman: Liu Yuyun, Wu Yujun; Manager: Huang Yueqiao, Tan An'ting; Treasurer: Wu Hanyu, Zhou Xingchi; Consultant: Li Xingqu, Wu Yaoting, Yu Zhuosheng; Auditor: Chen Xudian, Wu Yaonong. After the election, the Siyi Fundraising Conference began, with Liu Yuyun presiding and recording the proceedings.</p>
<p>Xin Hui County Magistrate Appeals for Relief</p>
<p>First, a letter from Li Wuzi, magistrate of the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, was read, requesting relief. The letter stated: (omitted above) Unfortunately, our county was invaded by the × on the 28th of last month. Wuzi is responsible for defending the territory and ordered his troops to fight to the death. In a few days, they repeatedly defeated the strong ×. Later, due to the inferiority of weapons and the disparity in numbers, they had to temporarily abandon Jiangmen County and defend the strategic points while awaiting reinforcements. Commander Deng Gu has already sent reinforcements in multiple directions. A counter-offensive will soon be launched and victory will be achieved. However, the local area has suffered greatly, and the situation is dire. The people have fled, scattered and displaced, and the food shortage is severe, with many awaiting food. The local area is filled with despair and is on the verge of starvation. Our county is adjacent to other villages, including Taikai in the near vicinity and Enping in the distance, collectively known as Siyi. Since the geography is adjacent and the fates are intertwined, if the resistance this time is weak, the × will take advantage of the situation, and all parts of Siyi will also fall into disaster areas. It is clear that survival depends on mutual support. Therefore, rescuing the refugees is urgent. I hereby request that overseas Chinese from Siyi in Hong Kong find ways to raise funds, especially urging your association to work tirelessly to save this crisis.</p>
<p>Forming Donation Teams to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>After the report, the discussion began. The results were as follows: (1) The Hong Kong Joint Committee for Relief of South China Refugees will allocate 200 bags of rice and medicines to the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce for emergency relief to refugees and wounded soldiers in the region. (2) A door-to-door donation team will be formed to solicit donations from overseas Chinese from Siyi. Wu Yaoting, Li Zizhen, Yu Rangli, Zhou Daozhuang, Wu Yujun, Chen Xudian, Liu Ziqing, Ma Guoying, Huang Zhong'an, Cen Xietang, and An Ting were elected as members. Directors of the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce will fully participate and cooperate in the work. (3) An immediate fundraising campaign was launched to aid Xinhui refugees. Liu Yuyun and Yu Sheng each donated HK$100, and more than 20 other individuals donated HK$50, HK$20, HK$10, HK$5, and HK$3, totaling HK$660. (4) The handling of "Lotus Rice Stones Returning to the Region for Distribution" will be managed independently by the chambers of commerce in each region. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Duty-Free Imported Rice - Please Approve Release</p>
<p>Furthermore, reporters investigated the issue of duty-free imported rice for Siyi. Since the Gongbei Customs had not yet received a formal order, they were unable to allow passage. Currently, more than 5,000 bags of rice from Taishan and Heshan counties had already been shipped to Macau and were temporarily stored in Huanmen, entrusted to the Macau Chamber of Commerce to pay taxes on their behalf and gradually import them. The Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, seeing this taxation as troublesome, specially requested the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Central Ministry of Finance, requesting them to quickly inform the Gongbei Customs to implement duty exemption for distribution. Furthermore, according to the Heshan Chamber of Commerce, they received a quick postal telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, approving the duty-free import of 300,000 metric tons of foreign rice, an increase of 100,000 metric tons from the previous approval. The Siyi Chamber of Commerce also received approval from the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday, also approving 300,000 metric tons, with 110,000 metric tons to be imported through Jiangmen and 190,000 metric tons through Gongbei Customs.</p>

<p>× often uses the slogan "Asia for Asians" to numb the weak and small ethnic groups in the East to achieve the conspiracy of aggression. Recently, × held the third Far East Student Conference in Tokyo, inviting Philippine students to participate. The Philippine Island Student Union responded to a certain invitation and sent a delegation to Japan. The delegation of 38 people, led by Mr. Luo Lu, departed from the Philippines on the Empress of Canada on the 10th and arrived in Hong Kong at 5:00 PM yesterday. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association, YMCA, YWCA, China Youth Journalists Association, Fujian Association, Amateur Friendship Society, Women's Comfort Association, Women's War Relief Association, and other organizations, fearing that the delegation would be misled by × propaganda and harm the feelings between the Chinese and Filipino peoples, jointly held a meeting this afternoon to host the delegation, report on the historical facts of our resistance war, and explain that our resistance war is for independence and freedom and has a close relationship with the Philippines. According to the delegation leader, they are attending the student conference in Japan and will also study Japanese education. They are scheduled to return to the Philippines in mid-May. Most of them are students from major high schools in the Philippines, totaling 38 people.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities previously purchased a batch of new-style alarms from London, which have recently been shipped to Hong Kong and installed. A test of the two types of alarms, air raid and all-clear, is scheduled for 2:15 PM and 2:20 PM tomorrow. At 2:15 PM, the air raid alarm will be tested. The sound will vibrate intermittently for three minutes, indicating that an air raid may occur within a few minutes. This is the first time.</p>

<p>At 2:25 PM, the all-clear alarm will be tested. The sound will be stable and will last for several minutes, indicating that the × aircraft have left the area or that the air raid threat has passed. After this test, if the authorities are satisfied, a third blackout exercise will be held in the near future. At that time, all alarm signals will be broadcast using this new machine. Residents should do their best to cooperate with the government to achieve a satisfactory level of darkness in Hong Kong, so that the × cannot see the face of Hong Kong and achieve the effect of air defense. It is reported that the alarm test yesterday was limited to Hong Kong Island, and the New Territories and Kowloon were not temporarily included.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Stuart Symington Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss National Orphan Relief. Groups in Various Regions Have Sheltered Up to 20,000 Orphans. Medical Supplies Are Extremely Lacking; Hope Overseas Chinese Will Donate. <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Stuart Symington, Design Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission's Political Department and Director of the China Wartime Child Relief Association, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Chongqing via Guilin. The reporter, aware of Mr. Symington's years of dedication to orphan relief, visited his residence and received a detailed account of the national orphan relief situation. According to him, national orphan relief organizations can be broadly divided into governmental and social categories. The former belongs to the Central Relief Committee, while the latter includes the Children's Welfare Association led by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the China Wartime Child Relief Association led by Xu Shiying and Ma Chaojun, the China Child Welfare Association led by President Kong, and the Hankou Children's Education Committee. The Central Relief Committee oversees and subsidizes the above four social relief organizations. Since the beginning of the war, the various groups have sheltered more than 20,000 orphans, establishing educational and care homes to provide them with education and care. The ages of the orphans range from two or three years old to sixteen or seventeen years old. In the educational homes established in the mainland, the issue of talent development is relatively minor due to the assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. However, there is a severe shortage of medical personnel and supplies. For example, in the educational home established by the China Wartime Child Relief Association in western Hunan, there is not even one nurse for every hundred children, and the lack of medicines and treatment equipment is alarming. This situation is not unique to western Hunan. When I passed through Shaoguan recently, I visited the educational home run by the Shaoguan International Relief Committee.</p>
<p>The Lack of Western Medicines is Similar. The Chairman of the association, American missionary Mr. Sanders, also conveyed this shortage to people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, hoping for more donations of medicines such as Lianwan, Santonin, Brandy, gauze, and cotton. It is said that Mr. Symington will appeal to all parties again after visiting Xu Shiying. Furthermore, Ma Guo and others, members of the China-Soviet Cultural Association residing in Hong Kong, took advantage of the visit of Situ De, the preparation member of the Guangxi branch of the Association, to Hong Kong, and planned to jointly hold a fellowship meeting with all the members of the Association residing in Hong Kong within a few days, and discuss the method of regular contact between the members of the Association residing in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Interview with Mr. Hang Liwu <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>The Cooperation Between the University of Hong Kong and Our University Is Under Discussion</p>
<p>Special Report by This Newspaper</p>
<p>The University of Hong Kong is the highest institution of learning in Hong Kong, and over 90% of the students at the University of Hong Kong are young people from our country. This shows that the students at the University of Hong Kong are not only the pillars of Hong Kong society but are also specialized talents who are eagerly anticipated by the motherland. The location of the University of Hong Kong also shows its importance.</p>
<p>In order for the University of Hong Kong to shoulder this great mission, establishing connections and cooperating with universities in our country is the path it should take in the future. In line with the close relationship and harmonious diplomatic ties between China and Britain, the cooperation between Chinese and British cultures is also an urgent task at present.</p>
<p>Governor Ong has commissioned many important Chinese and British officials to form a committee to carry out cooperation matters. Mr. Hang Liwu, the General Manager of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, is also one of the members. We believe that this is a major event that should be valued. Because in addition to "self-reliance," it is also very necessary to strive for international understanding and assistance. The past shortcomings of the University of Hong Kong also have a new opportunity.</p>
<p>On the 16th of last month, this newspaper published a special report on the news of the University of Hong Kong cooperating with universities in our country, and provided three suggestions as a welcome gift to Mr. Hang Liwu: (1) It is hoped that the University of Hong Kong will list Chinese as a required course; (2) It is hoped that the University of Hong Kong will hire more Chinese scholars who have confidence in promoting Sino-British diplomatic ties to serve as professors to better match the national conditions; (3) It is hoped that the University of Hong Kong will lower tuition fees to benefit poor students in their advanced studies. Looking around the cultural and educational circles in Hong Kong, the prospects for Chinese-British cultural cooperation are also of great concern. However, Mr. Hang was delayed due to illness, and the special committee of the University of Hong Kong to discuss the cooperation plan was also postponed repeatedly because Mr. Hang Liwu, the General Manager of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund representing our country, had not yet arrived. It was not until the day before yesterday that Mr. Hang finally arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing amidst our eager anticipation, and the special committee of the University of Hong Kong also began discussions in the meeting. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Hang Liwu with a sincere welcome and hope.</p>
<p>Gathering my strength to climb to the top of the mountain, I finally met Mr. Hang Liwu at the home of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong. He was an amiable and approachable middle-aged man. His opening words were: "Your special report 'The University of Hong Kong Cooperates with Our University' has been sent to me by Mr. Ye Gongchuo. I have also read your newspaper's Sunday essay 'Mr. Zhuang Zeyi's Higher Education Reform Issue' and other articles on bridging Chinese and British cultures. The ideas are all correct." It can be seen that Mr. Hang attaches great importance to the general discussion here. We sincerely hope that he will express our position and seriously discuss with the University of Hong Kong. This is an important key to Chinese-British cultural cooperation.</p>
<p>After a brief exchange of greetings, we slowly moved on to the topic at hand. The ringing of the telephone interrupted the conversation several times.</p>
<p>This time, the University of Hong Kong believes that it is necessary to cooperate with our country in order to develop its school affairs. Our educational authorities have expressed their infinite admiration for the Governor of Hong Kong—who is also the President of the University—and the Vice-Chancellor for their enlightened attitudes, and they are also very interested in Sino-British cultural cooperation.</p>
<p>In the past, we allocated 205,000 pounds of the Boxer Indemnity to the University of Hong Kong's foundation. This time, when discussing cooperation, the documents from the University of Hong Kong to our authorities did not have any financial requests. As for our authorities, we believe that if Sino-British cultural cooperation is effectively implemented, we will have no problem allocating more funds to help.</p>
<p>Mr. Hang has brought with him a plan from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education for the cooperation between the University of Hong Kong and us, with the main points focusing on improving the level of Chinese and cultivating talents in science, engineering, and medicine. As for the specific content, it is being discussed with the University of Hong Kong and is not yet ready to be released.</p>
<p>In short, the issue of cooperation between the University of Hong Kong and us is a very complex issue. However, under the leadership of the wise President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, it will not be difficult to gradually seek progress.</p>
<p>Mr. Hang also said optimistically: "In recent years, the improvement in the level of our domestic universities and the progress in all aspects have been very rapid. We hope that China and Britain can work together to move forward!" This is certainly good news that we are happy to hear.</p>
<p>The phone rang incessantly. Mr. Hang was too busy, so the reporter did not dare to ask for more guidance and said goodbye.</p>
<p>After sorting out the documents recently, Mr. Hang plans to write an article "Prospects for Sino-British Culture" to be published in this newspaper. We are waiting to learn from it.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Prospering Hong Kong: Hong Kong Authorities Actively Proceeding with Reclamation of the Central Waterfront. Surveying and Design Now Completed, Construction to Begin Soon. Funding of 580,000 to Be Completed Next Year. <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Public Works Department plans to reclaim the waterfront from the Unified Pier to the Hải An Shipyard in order to expand the Central Waterfront. After the implementation of this plan, the waterfront will be doubled. For the first phase of the project from Jubilee Pier to Pottinger Street, the Public Works Bureau has dispatched staff to conduct surveys and designs, which can be completed by the end of next year, costing 585,000 yuan, with 150,000 yuan to be used this year. Once the reclamation of this section is completed, new piers and parking lots for buses and private cars will be added. Because vehicles and pedestrians are currently concentrated at the Unified Pier, it is too crowded, so it is necessary to add a pier and parking lot. After the completion of the reclamation project of this section, the reclamation of the section from the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier to the Naval Shipyard will continue to complete the entire plan. At the same time, the Public Works Department is also reclaiming the North Point coast, with an expenditure of 400,000 yuan. The reclaimed land has been opened for bidding by the government, with the highest price being 2.20 yuan per square foot, and the average price being about 1.50 yuan per square foot. After the successive completion of the above projects, the Hong Kong waterfront, except for the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter, will become a straight line.</p>

<h3 id="e52">After I Issue General Attack Order in South China, the War Situation on the Entire West River Front Improves, Our Righteous Army Strives for Initiative, Intense Battle for Jiangmen Hui City Imminent, Our Army Recaptures Shaping and Approaches Jiujiang <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[West River Express] Since Commander Zhang Fakui issued the general offensive order on the 5th, the war situation in South China has seen rapid advances and the recapture of famous cities on the eastern, western, and northern fronts after bloody battles. The Cantonese bandits are already in a situation of being surrounded on all sides. On the West River front, our regular army and guerrillas have achieved close coordination, and the war situation has completely improved. Favorable strongholds in the vicinity of Jiangmen and Huicheng are all in our hands, and the capture of both places is imminent. The war situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guarding and Rushing to Build Fortifications</p>
<p>Continuous fierce battles have occurred in the suburbs of Jiangmen Huicheng in recent days. Yesterday, the 10th, our regular army under Deng Longguang attacked Huicheng along the Xinhe Highway, while another unit ambushed Jiangmen from the side. Our troops and the bandits made contact in Fozichiao, and both sides suffered casualties. Our troops guarding Wangyue Mountain, Xiang Mountain, and other positions launched an attack on Huicheng again yesterday morning. We used the terrain to bombard the bandit positions from high positions, killing dozens of them. However, the bandits used aircraft to assist in the battle, fiercely bombing our defenses, but they had no target and we suffered no damage. The bandits now stationed in Jiangmen Huicheng, facing the approach of our large army and being surrounded, forced our people to build defensive fortifications on the Xinhe and Jiangfo highways in the suburbs to protect the two strongholds of Jiangmen Huicheng.</p>
<p>Cavalry Assist in Battle, Killing More Than One Hundred</p>
<p>On the 11th, our army launched an attack from Hechuan, making rapid progress and approaching the outskirts of Jiangmen, where they encountered the bandits and engaged in fierce fighting. Our army fought bravely in close combat, killing thousands of bandits. Then, more than one hundred bandit cavalry rushed to reinforce them. Our army immediately used flat-firing guns and machine guns to fiercely strafe the bandit cavalry. After about two hours of stalemate, more than one hundred bandit cavalry were killed, and we also heroically sacrificed dozens of people. The bandits are still confronting us in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Jiujiang Suburban Areas, Our Troops and Bandits Confront Each Other</p>
<p>Since our army crossed the river at Haikou yesterday and attacked Jiujiang, our plainclothes troops once rushed into Jiujiang City and made some gains. Our army is now in close contact with the guerrillas, launching fierce attacks on Jiujiang. The bandit forces seem to be on the verge of collapse, but they are trying to resist stubbornly. The bandit leaders yesterday transferred more than 2,000 troops from Foshan and Guangzhou to reinforce Jiujiang. Currently, our troops and the bandits are still confronting each other in the Longshan, Longjiang, Xuexian Palace, and Jiujiang areas. However, our morale is extremely high, and there will be amazing progress on this line.</p>
<p>Recaptured Shaping Again at 3 AM Yesterday</p>
<p>After our army recaptured Shaping a few days ago, they withdrew again. Yesterday, the 11th, at 11:40 PM, our regular army stationed on the Shagu Highway, equipped with guerrillas, launched a counterattack on Shaping. A fierce artillery battle broke out between the two sides, and the sound of artillery fire rumbled throughout the night. Our army bravely charged, while another unit detoured to outflank the bandit's rear. The bandits could not take care of both ends, and at about 3 AM this morning, the bandits finally collapsed and withdrew from Shaping. Our army immediately entered, and Shaping Town was recaptured by us for the second time. In this battle, dozens of our soldiers sacrificed themselves, but we seized a lot of spoils of war. Our army is still actively continuing to advance towards the Gubudirection to wipe out the remaining bandits.</p>
<p>A Senior Officer Talks About Killing</p>
<p>A senior officer of the Fourth War Zone spoke freely about the battle in Xinhui, saying that the battle in Jiangxia Tangxia Huicheng was one of the best battles since the beginning of the war in South China. Although we abandoned some strongholds, we have formed a new front line in the Shaping to Huicheng area. This line and the bandit army's Tangxia to Huicheng line are almost balanced. The bandit's central breakthrough strategy is not easy to implement. If the bandits hit our waist, we can hit their head and tail. If the bandits hit our head and tail, we can attack their center. This is completely contrary to the previous method of sticking to one line and striving for initiative. Therefore, our army has been able to win victories in recent days. This is proof that our new strategy has been successful. It is believed that the full use of this strategy will surely cause a major blow to the bandits.</p>
<p>Bandit Regiment Commander Killed by Us</p>
<p>The officer then told reporters that when the Fifth District Guerrilla retreated from Jiangmen, their retreat plan was very orderly. The bandit army did not notice it and lightly pursued it, and was taken advantage of by the team. The bandit Regiment Commander Komura, the commander of the bandit army's attack on Jiangmen, was also killed by the ambush of the Fifth District Guerrilla during the pursuit. The bandit Regiment Commander Kotobuki Matsu, who commanded the troops at Shaping, was killed when our regular army launched an attack on Shaping. The remains of these two have been recovered and reported to the Fourth War Zone Command for record. As for the Fifth District Guerrilla being able to make such a contribution, a telegram has also been sent to commend them.</p>
<h3 id="e53">No Bandit Traces in Bao'an County, Bandit Planes Bomb Tangtouxia, Reconnaissance Flights Over Shenzhen Again Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Shenzhen Express] Yesterday, the 11th, the bandits attacked Nantou, Bao'an, and engaged in fierce fighting with our army. It is further investigated that our army once withdrew from Nantou County, and at noon, more than 400 of our guerrillas launched a counterattack. The bandits retreated completely before dusk, and fled back to the armed fishing boats at 11 PM. Yesterday, there were no bandit traces in Bao'an, but bandit planes flew to Tangtouxia in the morning and afternoon, indiscriminately bombing, and appeared in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Nantou Robbed</p>
<p>It was found that after the bandits entered Nantou City, they set off a major fire, and the county middle school and county government were destroyed. It was about 11 AM at the time, and the flames could be seen as far as Shekou. When the bandits entered the city, they were still afraid that our guerrillas would set a trap, so they still fired and swept around indiscriminately after entering the city. At the same time, the bandit soldiers also searched for pigs, cattle, and livestock.</p>
<p>Counterattack Victory</p>
<p>The bandits occupied Nantou this time, thinking that our army had all been transferred to counterattack Shilong and could not rush back in time. Therefore, they did not expect our army to launch a large-scale counterattack in the afternoon. Only after our large army approached the suburbs did they hurriedly fight back on one side and retreat on the other. Our army pursued them to the shore of Chiwan. Because they could not get on the ship immediately, they tried their best to resist. The two sides fought fiercely for several hours, until late at night, the bandits covered their troops boarding the ship on one side, and concentrated their fire and fired indiscriminately on the other. At 12 o'clock at night, there were no bandit traces in Bao'an.</p>
<p>Bandit Plane Activity</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10 AM, a team of six bandit planes flew to Tangtouxia on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and bombed it. The six planes flew in a character shape, flying very low, and dropped a total of eight bombs. The extent of the losses is unknown. At 3 PM in the afternoon, another bandit plane flew to Shenzhen, its purpose was to scout. It was found that after our army once attacked Shilong's bandit garrison the week before, the bandits were greatly frightened. Yesterday, the bandit planes flew and bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon line, its purpose was to attack our army.</p>

<p>[Kaiping Correspondent] The bandits threatened our Siyi coastal defense area and dispatched aircraft to bomb various places in Taishan and Kaiping on a large scale a few days ago. It has now been found that the Danshui Estuary area in Kaiping County has suffered the most. Among the bombings, the battle on the morning of March 29 at 11 AM was the most tragic. It was found that seven bandit planes indiscriminately bombed in shifts during this battle, dropping no less than thirty bombs, destroying a total of 48 houses and killing or injuring 36 citizens. The rear seat of the local police sacrifice office was also bombed. Fortunately, the county government authorities supervised their subordinates to provide effective rescue and rapid recovery work, and the market has now restored order.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Zhongshan Is Returned, Bandit Warships Bomb Xiangzhou Yesterday, Our Army Responded Calmly, Bandits Retreated Knowing the Difficulty <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Express] Since Ronggui in Zhongshan County fell, the bandits have been constantly sailing rubber boats, shallow-water warships, and iron tugboats in the coastal areas of the county, carrying bandit soldiers to harass us. However, our authorities have already strengthened defensive works along the coast, so the bandits are always dealt a heavy blow each time they come to attack. Yesterday (11th), Xiangzhou in the county's fifth district was bombed by bandit warships again. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Bandit Gunboats Harass Xiangzhou</p>
<p>Xiangzhou is located by the sea, adjacent to Tangjiawan. Most of the residents are engaged in fishing. Because the water level is deep, bandit warships often come and go openly, without any fear. At 4:45 PM on the 11th, a certain team in the area reported that two iron tugboats, one shallow-water warship, and three rubber boats, carrying bandit soldiers, were sailing from the south in single file. The team immediately prepared and waited in formation. Before long, when the bandit warships approached, they fired two cannons in succession and bombarded the shore. Then, machine guns fired thousands of rounds from the rubber boats, sweeping towards the same target. At that time, neighboring villages such as Qianshan, Baishi, and Tangjiawan heard the sound of gunfire. Although the local team saw that the bandits' attack was quite fierce, we immediately fired intensely. The bandits did not retaliate. Later, the bandit warships knew that it was not easy to attack, so they all sailed away, and Xiangzhou was as peaceful as ever.</p>
<p>Qianshan Was Once Alarmed</p>
<p>When the bandit warships bombarded Xiangzhou, the residents of Qianshan and other villages heard the sound of gunfire coming from Xiangzhou, suspecting that the bandits had landed from this direction. A small number of rural women turned pale and hurriedly carried quilts on their backs and led their children towards Macau. The order was quite chaotic. Later, Captain Xie of the local garrison explained to the people to dispel their doubts, and the people's hearts were calmed down. By 8 PM, order had returned to normal. The coastal areas of Zhongshan are still considered peaceful.</p>
<p>Guangdong Provincial Government Collects Propaganda Materials for Foreign Publicity</p>
<p>(Shaoguan Express) The Provincial Government yesterday instructed the commissioners of the districts and mayors of the counties, that the Central Propaganda Department's International Propaganda Office has issued a letter stating that the work of resisting the war and building the country has entered a very important stage, and all measures taken by the central and local military, political, economic, and cultural sectors that can enhance the strength of the resistance and enrich the people's livelihood should be widely publicized to foreign countries to strengthen our belief in the inevitable victory of the resistance and the inevitable success of the country's construction, and to arouse further international recognition of us. One part of the important work of this office is to collect materials, return manuscripts, and send them to various countries for publication. Therefore, we are sending letters to all competent authorities to solicit reports on recent work as a source of propaganda, and will send people to visit at any time to avoid omissions. In addition to sending letters, we are sending them to you respectfully, hoping that your government will provide as much as possible and send to our office the items under the jurisdiction of the various departments that can be published abroad, and inform the subordinate agencies to send similar materials together to facilitate the conduct of business, and to benefit the public, etc. is allowed, in addition to the sub-order, the combined order to the subordinate unity to comply with,</p>
<p>Bandit Economy Exhausted, Guangzhou Levies Harsh Taxes</p>
<p>[Guangzhou Express] Due to the exhaustion of the bandit army in Guangzhou and the lack of military pay, they have recently come up with a clever idea: to levy police donations, business taxes, protection fees, population taxes, etc., forcing the residents remaining in the city to pay according to regulations, otherwise they will be severely punished. The donations and business taxes have been levied separately from this month. The content of the levy is that the business tax is divided into four categories: A, B, C, and D. In recent days, a group of uglies has been sent out to harass various shops, investigate the amount of capital originally reported, and force them to increase it. The shops are already unable to operate in the city, and now they are being forced to levy such taxes, so they have closed their shops one after another and fled to the safe areas inland. As for the police donation protection fee, all the houses in the city are also classified into four categories: A, B, C, and D, and taxed according to the area, with an additional protection fee. The population tax is still being planned, and the pseudo-Maintenance Committee has been ordered to investigate the population.</p>
<p>Taicheng Holds Registration for Industry and Lodging, Strictly Investigates Traitors Mixing In</p>
<p>[Taishan Express] The Taicheng Police Station, because it is now the period of resistance to Japan, and attention should be paid to the security of the rear, since the Xinhe battle, traitors have been mixing in the hotels in this city, in order to thoroughly consolidate the security of the rear, a full city hotel industry worker registration was held on the 5th and 6th of this month, and it was stipulated that if any suspicious persons are seen in the hotel, they should be reported to the police at any time, to arrest them, in order to purge the traitors, so that the bandits can not use their old tricks, it is said that the registration has been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Changgang Ridge, Bandit Army Collapses, Both Sides Suffered Very Heavy Casualties, Our Army Follows Up and Pursues <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Wengyuan Special News] After a certain division of our 12th Group Army recaptured Huaxian County, a certain regiment of the chasing troops advanced south to the area of Luodong Village, Changgang Ridge. More than a thousand bandit reinforcements, with several aircraft taking turns bombing as cover, advanced north from Xinmin Xianlongkou Village on the 11th and attacked us fiercely. A fierce battle broke out immediately. Our officers and soldiers took advantage of the victory, responded calmly, and charged bravely, fighting fiercely all day. The bandits could not hold on and fled to the Zhongtan area of Longkou Village. Our army is still following up and pursuing them. Both sides suffered very heavy casualties in this battle. Our army seized many spoils of war. Bandit corpses and dead horses were scattered everywhere near Changgang Ridge.</p>
<p>Kaiping County Actively Proceeds With Adjustment of Baojia System</p>
<p>[Kaiping Correspondent] After the outbreak of fighting in Jiangmen and Xinhui, Chairman Li Hanhun of the provincial government, considering that the local grassroots organizations in the counties of Kaiping, Taishan, Chixi, and Xinxing, which are adjacent to the war zone, should be improved as soon as possible so that the implementation of government orders, the protection of security, and the promotion of conscription are absolutely smooth, in order to meet the needs of wartime, has issued a special order to the governments of the counties to quickly and conscientiously adjust the Baojia system. Those who have already handled the soundness of the system should strive for perfection, and those who have not been thorough should speed up the process. The county governments have received the order and are proceeding separately. Kaiping County is stepping up the process. It has been found that the county government has entrusted Chen Qitai, secretary of the county government, and Section Chiefs Yu Xifu, Su Fanyi, Liang Jinquan, Chen Weiwan, Wu Zhizhao, chief of the police bureau, and other eleven people as members of the Baojia Adjustment Committee, and convened an adjustment meeting on the same day to discuss a three-step adjustment: 1. Propaganda, 2. Compilation and inspection, and 3. Spot checks, etc. Also, because the districts must proceed simultaneously, Committee members Sun Shengwu, Zhao Sen, Hui Ji Rong, Zhou Fuyuan, etc. were assigned to the districts under the county to work with the district heads, in order to be meticulous, and it was decided to complete the adjustment work within one month.</p>

<p>The Importance of Children's Films in Various Countries: A Unique Tool for Assisting Children's Education</p>
<p>Film has already been recognized as a rapid tool for assisting children's education. Therefore, countries around the world currently attach great importance to children's films. Now, I will briefly report to the readers on the situation of children's films in various countries.</p>
<p>United States: The United States is an advanced country in the film industry. Therefore, film education in the United States is also more advanced than in any other country. Many schools in the United States now purchase projectors and screen children's films every Sunday or holiday. Some are specially filmed by public institutions collecting materials and compiling scripts, and some are filmed by film companies specifically for schools or educational institutions to screen. Even ordinary cinemas that publicly screen films with children's educational significance will significantly reduce ticket prices for children who go to watch them.</p>
<p>United Kingdom: In tradition, the ancient films, which are somewhat conservative in everything, are certainly no exception. Special attention is paid especially to children's films. When the film censorship boards in various places inspect films, each film must be prefixed with the letter A or U. The letter A is an abbreviation of "Adult," which means that only adults are allowed to watch, and children are not allowed. The letter U is an abbreviation of "Universal," which means that adults and children can enter and watch. In recent years, the United Kingdom has established an agency dedicated to children's films, shooting children's films, and publicly screening them in public institutions or schools.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy: Both Germany and Italy, as dictatorial countries, also attached great importance to children's films. However, after the Fascists gained power, these two countries successively controlled the film industry, using films as a tool for propaganda. Political function is more important than entertainment, so children's films are no exception. The government selects materials for children's films, films them, some overtly and some subtly, and propagates Fascism and National Socialism to children. And cinemas and schools often have public screenings of such children's films.</p>
<p>Soviet Union: The progress of the Soviet film industry is extraordinarily rapid, which is enough to surprise anyone. In particular, great attention is paid to film education. Taking Moscow alone, every holiday, more than 500 cinemas screen children's films in rotation from 9 am to 9 pm. The low ticket prices are unprecedented in other countries. These films, including features and cartoons, are produced by the government and are exclusively for children aged 8 to 16. In terms of production, the stories are all aimed at children, which is different from ordinary films.</p>
<p>China: Finally, what I want to say is that our China Central Film Censorship Committee does not have a clear indication of whether the film is suitable for children to watch during the film censorship. The country has not prohibited children from watching certain types of films. However, in recent years, attention has also been paid to film education. Taking Shanghai alone, the China Film Education Association has a branch in Shanghai, and often screens specially filmed or selected children's films in various primary and secondary schools for free in rotation. However, after "August 13th," this agency also temporarily withdrew with the National Army to the west.</p>

<p>The "American China Film United Company," which governs the three major companies Xinhua, Huacheng, and Huaxin, recently established its general office at No. 42, 4th Floor, No. 9 Bund, French Concession. The internal layout is all set. "Guolian" China General Manager Zhang Shankun, as well as the sales managers of the three companies, Li Dashen, Ka Yuying, and Wu Bangfan, etc., have come to this new address since yesterday and started business.</p>
<p>Wang Hanlun, who has been out of the limelight for many years, used to set up Hanlun Beauty Salon on Xiafei Road, operating a beauty business similar to a barber shop. Later, she married and retired, and then stopped. Later, she had a falling out with her husband, Wang Jihuan (a famous scholar from eastern Zhejiang), in Hangzhou and was involved in a lawsuit, which eventually led to their separation. Not long after, Ji Huan was killed when a house collapsed. Since Wang Hanlun came to Shanghai again, she has not developed much either. Recently, she has formulated a plan, thinking about moving after a long period of dormancy, preparing to raise 5,000 gold to restore the old business of the beauty salon. It is heard that under active progress, there are already some clues, and she will seek to start it.</p>

<h3 id="e62">First Division League Championship Final: Navy General vs. South China; Many Talents, Strength Unknown; South China Also Slightly Changed Due to Mai Shaohan's Illness <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] This football season can be concluded at the end of this month. The Football Association and the Police have decided that the 22nd will be the date for the First Division League Championship and the League Team Performance. The champion and runner-up of the league have not yet been resolved, and the match between South China and the Navy on the 15th will determine who wins.</p>
<p>The Football Association originally wanted to hold this match earlier this month, but it could not obtain the consent of the Navy, because the Navy believed that holding it earlier would be detrimental to them, because many warships were at sea at the beginning of this month, and the strong players were not fully assembled.</p>
<p>At present, there are many warships docked in the port, so the Navy's football talents have also increased. However, what its strength is is something that those who are interested in football want to know in advance. Whether South China can win the championship depends entirely on the gains and losses at this final juncture. Therefore, the strength of the Navy is strong or weak, which is affected by the success or failure of China.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation with relevant parties in the Navy, it is learned that its battle line at that time is generally as determined below. However, after carefully reading the military post, there are already many strong players who are not on the list, because Dixon and Didi have returned to the United Kingdom, so there are many new people on the list. However, its strength cannot be predicted.</p>
<p>On the South China side, because Mai Shaohan is ill and still needs to recuperate, he will definitely not be able to play at that time. Therefore, the proposed lineup is slightly the same as when facing the police in the special silver medal final the other day. Li Guowei will serve as the left inside guard, and Guo Yingqi will serve as the right forward guard. As for the forward position, it will be filled by Li Enliang.</p>
<p>In addition, the Football Association has decided that the performance match on the 22nd will add a match between the Second Division champion team and the League team, and the award ceremony will be held after the match. (Taisui)</p>
<p>The two lineups proposed by South China and the Navy are as follows:</p>
<p>South China South</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai, Bao Jiaping, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Liu Qingcai, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Luo Douwen, Li Enliang, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Navy Team</p>
<p>Luo Bianchen, Xuan Di, Ge Lianchen, Gan Nichang, Ta Gen, Han Ni, Gao Lushi, Ban, Li Shi, Li Shi, Yan Luode, Lang</p>

<p>In the public men's basketball game, the Hong Kong University team played against the police last night. Hong Kong has been defeated in all battles since its debut, and the police have not yet won. In terms of strength, the police are stronger than Hong Kong University. Bu Wei said that after the connection, Hong Kong University was full of energy and overwhelmed the police with 20 to 12 in the first half. Later, the police changed their strategy and transferred Hui Tingkai to serve as a forward, which gave Hong Kong University a great threat, and won with 46 to 37.</p>
<p>In the second group, Guan Lei fought against Da Zhong. Guan Lei's offensive power was not weak, but the people in the team were able to unite in attack and defense. Dong Qibiao, He Jinshi, Wu Kun, Zheng Yong, etc. made special contributions. Therefore, Guan Lei lost with a score of 31 to 51.</p>
<p>In the final game, Qingzhi played against Zhongsheng. After the start of the competition, the strength of the two sides was very different. Qingzhi was repeatedly broken by Zhongsheng.

<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] In the Second Division Football League, after South China defeated Scott and won the championship, as for the runner-up spot, because the Fifth Battalion Artillery and Middlesbrough had the same score, a final match must be held to determine who it belongs to. It was found that this final match was originally scheduled to be held at the Sochengbu at 3:30 pm yesterday.

According to the investigation, the Fifth Battalion Artillery did not receive the notification letter from the Football Association and did not know about the competition in advance, so they did not send a team to the scene.

<p>In the Open Grass Tennis Tournament, there were originally two scheduled doubles and singles matches yesterday, but the doubles match between Xu Runpei and Xu Weipei against Lin Tiande and Huang Xi was postponed due to Lin Tiande's illness. Therefore, there was only one singles match between Na Xi and Li Huitang. Na Xi was indeed not Li Huitang's opponent, but his batting technique was still good. In the second set, he once launched a fierce attack on Li, but in the end, he was unsuccessful due to insufficient stamina. On the contrary, Li played steadily, but his splitting and killing were inferior to Na Xi. He was only able to use his intelligence to take advantage of the situation, combining gentleness and strength, and especially able to engage in short-range combat in front of the net, which made Na Xi exhausted. Li won in two straight sets. Today, there will be two singles matches, and Xu Weipei vs. Kobayashi Zhen will be the most spectacular, because these two were the champion and runner-up of the previous year. Meeting today, the performance is expected to be wonderful, but Xu's ball skills are superb and he will definitely be able to win.</p>

Select two students from among the students. Student A calls out the name, and Student B calls out what should be done. For example, when Student A calls out Zhang San and Student B calls out "Sit still, raise hands upward," Zhang San should sit still and raise hands upward. After calling out the names of the whole class, or in the middle, if anyone does not comply with the designated action, the public or the teacher will give him a punishment that he can bear, such as singing, rolling on the ground, animal behavior, etc. For example, Zhang San should sit still and raise his hands upward. If he laughs or puts his hands down in the middle, he should be given appropriate punishment. This game can cultivate students' beautiful qualities of obedience and endurance.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Chatting About Tennis <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Tilden Says Amateur Tennis World</p>
<p>Only Has Five Years of Life Left: Professionalization After Five Years</p>
<p>[London Correspondent] According to former Wimbledon champion Tilden, amateur tennis only has five years of life left. After this, open tournaments in which amateur and professional players compete together will definitely appear.</p>
<p>"All the great players are now gradually leaving the amateur world," Tilden said yesterday. "In the near future, there will definitely come a day when there will be no good players in the amateur team who can attract the audience. At that time, there will be no one in the amateur tennis world who can protect the money, and naturally open tennis tournaments will emerge."</p>
<p>Tilden will soon go to Olympia to participate in professional competitions. He hinted that if the amateur side does not listen to the professional players now, then when they ask the professional players to compete with the amateur players in the future, if they are rejected by the professional players, then it will be "too late to regret."</p>
<p>But let's see what the other side says.</p>
<p>Simpson Says Tilden is Threatening</p>
<p>Amateur Tennis is Currently Thriving</p>
<p>Simpson, a sports reporter for the London Daily Mail, said that Tilden actually thought that we could say goodbye to the Davis Cup, Wimbledon and other competitions within five years and go to join hands with professional players to form open tennis tournaments together.</p>
<p>What he said may come true – who knows what things will change in five years? Many people say in unison that our tennis leaders dare not admit reality, but we cannot just accept Tilden's threat so docilely. Although there are still many amateur players receiving subsidies, we cannot but admit that amateur tennis is thriving.</p>
<p>In amateur tennis, there are predetermined victories. It is different in professional tennis. It is often suspected that some professional competitions are often rehearsed like a play before going on stage.</p>
<p>To win the audience's interest and create opportunities for the success of the next competition. Like this, if professional players also join Wimbledon, then tennis will be completely over.</p>
<p>Furthermore, assuming that the management completely allows it, are all amateur players willing to reach out and take a salary? Does everyone, no matter where they are, think that money is more important than anything else?</p>
<p>And how can we guarantee that professional players will definitely raise the standard of tennis a little bit? How do we know that amateur tennis will not disappear after five years? And how many places in the world are as wealthy as the United States? Moreover, even in places as wealthy as the United States, only exhibition matches can support some money. Therefore, whether amateur tennis will completely perish, this should also be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Panlai Speaks: Australia May Win the Taiwan Cup</p>
<p>American Main Player Drops Out: Victory Only Accounts for Half</p>
<p>Davis Cup. The tennis tournament has already begun this year. The defending champion, the American team, has suffered great losses in strength because its main player, Boqi, has already transferred to the professional world. It is also very speculative as to who will win the cup. According to the New York Telegraph, Panlai, the former British main player and champion of Wimbledon, who had run, said to people at the International Indoor Tennis Tournament here a while ago that who will be the owner of the Taiwan Cup this year is a very interesting question. At present, the United States' hope of maintaining the Taiwan Cup is only 50%. According to Jin's opinion, the Taiwan Cup may be owned by Australia, because if the United States has Boqi, it will get two points. Now that Bo has transferred to the professional world, the best player in the United States is Riggs, and what Riggs holds is his backhand shot. However, Brownville of Australia is good at fighting with both hands, and both his backhand and forehand are strong, and there is no difference. Therefore, Li has no possibility of defeating Bo. The key to victory or defeat lies in this. If Australia can retire from the group and fight with the United States, then the Cup treasure is also very promising.</p>

<h3 id="e73">On the Trivialities of Art <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>The essential characteristic of art lies in its typicality. The reflection of objective reality in works of art is not done in a piecemeal and straightforward manner. It must be done through the artist's artistic generalization, so as to express the truth of reality in a universal and typical way. All great artists, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, their artistic victories are also the victories of their typical creations. "The power of art lies in generalization, in universalization." In the entire organism of art, it is completely impossible for us to abandon its characteristic of typicality. The task of the artist is to create artistic types, and from artistic types, to deepen and broaden people's understanding of life and reality, in order to "raise mankind above reality."</p>
<p>Art must have its typicality; this is already a definitive conclusion. But in addition to typicality, or rather, within typicality, art still cannot abandon its accuracy in detail. When Engels discussed this issue in a letter to Margaret Harkness, he emphasized, "I think realism means not only the correctness of detail, but also the correct transmission of typical characters in typical circumstances." From these two sentences of Engels, we can clearly see that in realism, although typicality is the basic and main trigger, the trivialities of art are also a factor that cannot be ignored or missing. Only in the organic combination of profound creation of typicality and accurate depiction of trivialities can excellent and great works of art succeed.</p>
<p>Detail—triviality is an important element in art. Although it is often looked down upon by many harsh critics or simply opposed by them, its existence in art, its provision of infinite clarity to art, is undeniable. The trivialities of art bring extraordinary persuasiveness in life, the soundness of images, and the clarity of environment to the creation of typicality. The generalization of art requires not only depth but also the coherence, persuasiveness, and clarity of the images of each detail, each scene, each character, etc. These can only be obtained and maintained in the correct depiction of artistic trivialities. Therefore, the trivialities of art become something that an artist cannot neglect during creation. Gorky, in his book "My Literary Education," repeatedly pointed out from his own early literary experience his mistakes in the depiction of trivialities when writing, and said, "This kind of mistake seems unimportant, but in fact it has great significance, because this kind of mistake will destroy the truthfulness of art." From this, we can see the importance of the meaning of artistic trivialities in the whole of art.</p>
<p>The trivialities of art can give a strong color to works of art and artistic types, and endow vivid stories and vibrant characters with freshness, clarity, vitality, and originality. Sholokhov, in "And Quiet Flows the Don," skillfully used various trivial depictions, clearly marking the entire artistic achievement with strong colors, giving people a particularly profound impression. This is one of his great successes. The correctness of artistic details can strengthen the power of art and give artistic types a fresh identity. Due to the trivialities of art, the soundness of images, the persuasiveness of life, and the clarity of the environment can be completed, and art can obtain its full persuasive power. In order to make works of art play a more active role, in order to make art achieve greater success, artists must put more effort and make more efforts in the depiction of artistic trivialities, emphasizing the vivid colors of the truth of reality from the truthful expression of artistic trivialities.</p>
<p>However, we must pay attention to the fact that the trivialities of art are not equal to being disorganized. The detailed description of each detail, scene, character, and situation does not mean that the artist should indiscriminately pile up each detail into the work without choice, order, or clarity. Artistic creation does not need simple trivialities, but needs accurate, ordered trivialities. It must be such trivialities that can make art obtain its particularity, clarity, and persuasiveness. Therefore, the trivialities of art, no matter which detail, scene, character, or situation, needs to be of high quality, a typical thing. For the entire work of art, it must become an indispensable and special aspect. When an artist wants to describe a special life phenomenon, if he needs to use artistic trivialities to emphasize the color of life, then he must select the most distinctive details that can clearly express the phenomenon from the aspects he needs, organize them, arrange them, so as to make them become an organic part of his art.</p>
<p>Although the trivialities of art are an important factor in the formation of art, they cannot be separated from the typicality of art and exist independently. Without the trivialities of art, it is true that typicality would lose its vivid posture and strong colors, but if artistic trivialities are raised not on the basis of typical creation, then it completely loses its existence. The typicality is still the basic and main. The trivialities of art are only a foil and subordinate. Only under the premise of strengthening typicality, deepening typicality, and matching typicality can the trivialities of art have its basis for existence. Its task is to render and create the general typicality from various special details. Therefore, the trivialities of art are the bridge of the generalization of art, the road from the particular to the general for art. Merely trivialities are not everything, nor are they a work of art. If someone regards trivialities as the fundamental content of art, it is undoubtedly lowering art, or rather, destroying art, because simply describing the trivial and non-essential aspects of objective reality, not distinguishing between the trivial things and the main aspects in reality, and blindly imitating the surface of life and reality, is unable to grasp the center of reality and the overall appearance of life. Blind imitation and trivial accumulation can only show the weakness and powerlessness of the artist and the work of art!</p>
<p>We must look at the trivialities of art from the perspective of typical creation in order to understand its fundamental meaning.</p>

<p>— Ren Yinghui</p>
<p>Friends who are fighting for the glory of the motherland, I am moved by the letters written by you with passion and blood and tears. Every time I read your letters and savor your arduous and great deeds, how violently my blood vessels throb. I clearly know that your will has not wavered in the slightest. You resolutely appear at the front and rear of the × people with a heroic posture. You have demonstrated the great power of young people in action and work, and fulfilled your own tasks. This is the guarantee of the final victory of the motherland.</p>
<p>I will eternally remember what you said: "It is glorious to die in battle for the survival of the motherland," and "It has the highest value to die in battle for the establishment of a new life path for the nation's descendants." Friends, these words are absolute truth, the cry of the new generation of the Chinese nation. Only you who are in combat can recognize them more clearly, and only you are worthy of shouting them loudly.</p>
<p>The motherland is in battle, and you in the great ranks of battle have stood up without shame. You braved the bullets of the × people, went through life and death, and endured all kinds of hardships. You have never said a word of "fear of difficulty and avoidance of responsibility." You have not been in the slightest bit negligent in your work. Your determination in the belief of resistance and your enthusiasm for the civil movement all show that you have exhausted your strength. In your letters, you have never mentioned the issues of living conditions in the death-defying work and the personal prospects. This clearly shows that you have forgotten your own existence and have already put the country and the nation first. If it is said that this is your great achievement, it is rather to say that everything that has awakened and progressed in China in the battle.</p>
<p>Friends in battle, you earnestly hope that young people like you will return to the motherland and place themselves in the great torrent of the War of Resistance. You said that there are places for young people to work everywhere in the war zone, and young people are needed everywhere to exert their strength. I have a 120,000-point agreement on this. We will soon answer you with facts. Although it is good here, it is definitely not a place where young people like us can live for a long time. We will soon pack our bags and return to the country, and stand with you, the thousands and millions of Chinese fighters, and build a great wall of flesh and blood in the ranks of the War of Resistance to defend a path to life for the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Friends, friends in battle, we return to the country and stand with you, work together, and we are "alive." Although we are living a comfortable life of peace here, we are feeling suffering from the bottom of our hearts—friends, we are about to embark on the journey, wait! We will meet soon.</p>
<p>From afar, I wish you who are valiantly resisting the war for the motherland good health.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Tidbits of Chao'an <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ding</p>
<p>Chao'an is a county town with feudal remnants. The most prosperous and longest road is called Taiping Road, just like Huiai Road and Hanmin Road in Guangzhou, and Nathan Road and Shanghai Street in Hong Kong. However, it does not have any Westernized flavor, but rather has a strong feudal meaning. Along the road, there are many archways from the emperor's era, and the plaques of "Holy Day" are still hanging. The shops on both sides are all flat and have no special features, but many of the residents still have red-door bridges; there are golden characters or golden Bagua patterns in front, and the elderly women still wear trouser leggings, bound feet, and wear long-sleeved robes. Walking on such a road, it is as if you are in the world of an old novel. There are very few vehicles on the road, only some rickshaws and bicycles, and occasionally one or two streamlined cars pass by, which are those of "officials and dignitaries" from Shaoguan, with yellow mud splashes decorating the body.</p>
<p>In the spring of March, it should be the time of "drizzling rain." The buildings on the road are not arched but flat, so the rainwater does not flow away by itself, making the road muddy and difficult to walk. I went back to the hotel alone and asked the "waiter" to make tea. The teacup turned out to be as small as a wine glass. It is said that this is the custom of drinking tea here. If you drink from a large cup, it is not "civilized" enough. The entire county town does not have a single restaurant. No, there are also teahouses here, but they are not for people to "sip tea" but for eating and drinking. The food is very expensive. The dishes in ordinary medium-sized restaurants cost five or six jiao to one yuan each (most have been changed to national currency). Those at the lower level also cost two jiao for a meal package. As for rice, there has recently been a severe rice shortage in the Chaoshan area, with each yuan only buying nine tubes—about six jin or so, which directly affects the lives of most civilians.</p>
<p>There is not much atmosphere of wartime on the streets. There are no slogans, slogans, or wall newspapers. I went to the county civil education hall alone to take a look. Inside a large courtyard, there are rows of exhibition rooms, but they are all closed, covered with dust and cobwebs. The animal and plant specimens displayed inside are all in a disordered and incomplete state. There are no people coming to visit, and no staff are managing them. Only one worker is repairing the windows at the door. This situation is very desolate and dull. However, according to the newspapers, the national salvation movement in Chao'an is very enthusiastic. These days, they are carrying out condolences to the families of soldiers on expeditions, preparing for the expanded commemoration of the "March 29th" Huanghua Festival, and joint symposiums of various social organizations—party, government, and culture.</p>
<p>The people of Chao'an love music, so the musical instruments produced here are very famous. As long as two meals a day are not a problem, they like to play the coconut fiddle (a huqin made of coconut shell) and the qinqin in their spare time. Once I went to the Hongqiao area in the suburbs to stroll around. The scenery there is very good. There are blossoming kapok trees, and mountain lodges by the narrow pond, planted with silky willows on both sides. Under the backing of a small hill, there is a natural park. In a thatched hut in a nearby vegetable garden, I heard popular Chao'an music. However, these songs are all decadent and charming. According to the Cantonese saying, you can say that "you can hear the ear oil coming out," but it definitely cannot arouse intense emotions. The reason why this "Chaoshan music" is so attractive, in my opinion, is that it can use soft melodies and properly matched harmonies. In the Taiping prosperous age of entertainment and peace, people leisurely listen to a song after enjoying a comfortable life, and the taste is no less than that of the leisure class of tobacco and chocolate; but today, when the smell of gunpowder is strong, and Chao'an has become an important place on the eastern road of Guangdong, the general public is still immersed in soft and charming colors. This needs to be greatly reformed. I hope that the comrades of national salvation in Chaoshan will actively promote anti-× songs that can inspire, excite, and agitate, and sweep away the decadent and depressed customs!</p>

<p>— Chu Qing</p>
<p>It's the time when kapok flowers are blooming again</p>

<p>I dream of that unforgettable old place</p>
<p>(That, although not my true hometown</p>
<p>But I once grew up there)</p>
<p>Gentle sea, oh</p>
<p>The morning sun and water are like a pair of leaning lovers</p>
<p>In the silky drizzle</p>
<p>The cowherd children step on the shining dewdrops</p>
<p>The loud singing breaks through the silence of the wilderness</p>
<p>Over there, scattered huts</p>
<p>Release wisps of cooking smoke</p>
<p>Chickens and dogs have not broken the tranquility of the countryside</p>
<p>We once relied on two hands</p>
<p>Or an ox</p>
<p>On that fertile seaside</p>
<p>Living a comfortable life of the ancient century</p>
<p>But, since the Rising Sun flag appeared at the mouth of the Pearl River</p>
<p>A group of demons landed on the coast</p>
<p>The huts turned into ashes</p>
<p>Sisters were raped</p>
<p>The lucky ones only picked up a life from the cracks of guns</p>
<p>Now, the green fields are covered with blood and ointment</p>
<p>The sea is sobbing</p>
<p>Only sorrow remains in the hometown</p>

<p>Take the spring light and return</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Work? Hmph, is it just the work of killing people?" Fearing that these tough words would provoke a tough reaction from the other party, she paused and carefully observed the other party, because the other party was still holding the key to her life. She did not dare to resist harshly, nor was she willing to easily obey, so she had to use all her intelligence to ridicule, reluctantly speaking with a tough tone, and asked again: "Could it be that other people's graves are the foundation of your work?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Tell you, those who have killed people are not necessarily heroes!"</p>
<p>"Yes, those who are killed are not necessarily weak."</p>
<p>"Weak," she is weak. Otherwise, she could have escaped. If: When the maid served tea, when she stayed on the snowy road... But now, even if she is strong and has the determination to take risks, her result is bound to be failure. Because now he has changed his predetermined way of working. He does not hesitate to sacrifice her to complete his work.</p>
<p>"Your work, I know! Or know even more, I am weak! For the sake of work, for the sake of the weak, you should still fire a shot!... If your work can succeed, the death of the weak is nothing to regret!"</p>
<p>So, he told her the main reasons for killing her: in addition to hatred for her father, it was only money, just money. Then, he asked her again:</p>
<p>"Do you value it? Do you value your own life?"</p>
<p>"My money belongs to my father, my life is my own--"</p>
<p>"Then, do you love money? Or do you love life?"</p>
<p>"Is it that I love money?"</p>
<p>"Then I'll kill you?"</p>
<p>"What if I love life?"</p>
<p>"Then you come with me!"</p>
<p>"What if I don't love money or life?"</p>
