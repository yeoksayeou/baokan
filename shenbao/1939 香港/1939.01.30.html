<h3 id="c1">日本長期作戰的把握何在？ <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>最近日首相平沼在衆議院中答覆各議員關於對華政策的質問，曾聲明日本決不變更已定的對華政策，縱使第三方面擬對日本施行經濟壓力，日本也已籌有抵制辦法。日衆議員之所以提出對華政策的質問，乃是表示日本人民對於侵華戰爭的憂慮和失望，而平沼所答覆的，却仍然表示日　法西斯軍閥要一意孤行。</p>
<p>日本以一小小島國，合本部朝鮮台灣和南庫頁島，不過六十七萬餘方公里的土地，九千七百餘萬的人民，農產礦藏都極稀少，她要維持對華十年戰爭，甚至百年戰爭，甚至不惜和第三國再來一拼，眞是狂吠夢囈。在過去十九個月的中日戰爭中，日本在人力方面已有不能繼續支持的徵象。最近派遣來華的新軍，多是視力不佳的少年兵，各種機械部隊裏面，參雜了不少法西斯的歐洲同志。至於日昨所傳日軍部擬延長在華海陸軍服務年限，和近來日本積極招編中國流氓散匪，實行以華制華的政策，那更是日本國內人力空虛的鐵證。</p>
<p>在經濟方面，日本更加非常貧弱。今年初日本輿論界對于過去的日本經濟情況，曾發表過樂觀的論調，並誇耀她經濟基礙的堅強，可以負担「戰鬥的」或「建設的」兩重任務，這種樂觀的輿論，欺騙不了日本國民，也欺騙不了國際人士，祗要拿她最關重要的財政和對外貿易來說，就可以知道日本的經濟已到了總崩潰的時期。</p>
<p>先就日本的財政來說：前年度一般歲出及對華侵略費用的軍事特別支出，約爲六十億三千萬元，去年度增至八十億四千餘萬圓，今年度據報載一般歲出爲三十六億九千餘萬圓，軍事特別支出爲五十四億圓，合計在九十億圓以上。像去年入十億的歲入，日本已有不能負担的趨勢，以一般收入和支出相比較，每月支出超過常在三億圓到五億圓之間，日本爲填補這筆赤字，祇好在公債發行，新稅增收，和通貨膨脹上，極力對人民加以××。可是這三項辦法，現在都已經達到了飽和點。去年四十三億圓的公債，僅僅售去三十六億圓；二億三千萬圓新稅的增收，已使人民認「一菜一湯主義」爲奢侈行爲；年底二十八億五千萬元的紙幣發行額，固然是造成了日本紙幣發行的空前最高記錄，實際上還有在中國所發的大量軍用手票和偽鈔，尚未計算在內，那末今年的九十億元的歲出，在這民窮財盡的時候，恐怕除走向破產之路，再也沒有第二條可走吧！</p>
<p>再就日本的對外貿易來看：日本的對外貿易，乃是日本各產業部門的生命綫。去年前十一月出口二十三億九千萬元，人口二十三億八千萬元，入超一千餘萬元，日本認爲這是戰時的最好現象。其實日本這種入超現象，乃是她的侵畧武力所造成。去年日本對偽滿華北等處所謂日幣集團的貿易，出口較前年增加百分之四十，入口增加百分之十八：但對歐美其他各國輸出入方面，都有減少，並且還是繼續入超，其惡化的程度，比較從前還要厲害。所以日政府感覺到統制貿易的力暈不夠，還要提倡種種輸出貿易振興策。現在日本的對外貿易，輸出與輸入，在政府統制之下完全是以軍事的需要爲目標，因此大量黃金不斷外流，國內一般非軍事工業普遍衰落。其他物價的提高，勞工的失業，雖在經濟警察監視下，不能完全透露眞實的情形，但就所透露的現象看，也已有走向惡化路上的傾向了。</p>
<p>無論人力和物力，日本決沒有長期作戰的可能。日本現在所　望的，乃是一方面從中國取得長期作戰的原料和食料，如東北的石油與煤鐵，華北的棉花與羊毛，長江流域的米粮，現時都在儘量搜括中；一方面則希望繼續能將日本主要產品推銷英美各國及其殖民地，因而藉此得到英美各國對於原料及軍需品的供給。所以只要中國能夠在遊擊區域打破日本的經濟控制力量，英美各國能夠對日實施經濟報復，便眼見得日本所誇能夠應付長期戰爭的迷夢要隨着國力的崩潰而幻滅了。</p>
<h3 id="c2">昆明民校參觀記 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— （本報特約昆明通訊）　木林</p>
<p>天寒地凍的嚴寒，匆匆地快過完了。刺骨的北風，也漸漸地減去了她的威力。山國裏的天氣，已陸續地暖和起來，山茶已開暴了荒郊，烏兒巳湊起囘春之曲。微微的春風，拂着枯死的草木，這正是大地囘春的時候！</p>
<p>一元復始，萬象更新，這正是爲了春風的可愛，所以大地上的一切，在這時都入了一個新的階段，這裏兩萬多的文盲，在此時有一部份也隨着春風而進到化雨的懷抱裏。</p>
<p>他們和她們，都是爲了環境的不許可，以到了十六歲的年紀，仍沒有讀書的　　。其實他們不是甘心墮落，不願讀書：而是國內的教育貴族化了，所以你們雖踏過了就學的階段，仍然還是文盲。現在，爲了要支持這長期的抗戰，和動員後方民衆的組織，在社會上巳是不能容許這大批文盲的存在了。因之國內的教育當局，特於義務教育以外，更倡導這偉大的民衆教育。</p>
<p>這兒的民衆補習，計劃是遠在上年的十二月便着手了，下過因爲統籌計劃的原故，要動員大量的人力財力，所以必得要經過一個長時期的準備。其間經各方人士的動助，和教育當局的努力，並由教部和教廳撥劃了相當的經費，一直到十二月十七日，才開始宣傳，由十八日起，市小三百多教師，沿門挨戶整日地做調查工作，到十二月廿六日，才算把這筆糊塗帳調查淸楚。整個　明市的文盲，是二萬多人——由十六歲到四十歲，其中女子佔三分之二。若以全市的人口來比較，那末傳佔了十分之一左右。由這　看起，便知道不補習是沒有辦法可以組織他們的，經過了祥細的計劃以後　把他分做四期，每期補習五千人。補習的日期是兩個月，第一期規定，由十六歲至卅歲的失學者，幷指定市立華山，東昇，武成，景虹，桃源，咸和，尚義，古憧安瀾，聚奎，一前衛，景星，古祥，威遠，忠愛，祟仁，書林，議國，新橋，南強，吳溪，圓通，　峯，承華，翠湖，蓮華，大觀，夕林等廿八個小學負責，成立民衆學校訓練。在這樣的籌組下，經過了不少的因難，這民衆補習教育，終於在一月十五日實現了。</p>
<p>記者因爲關乎我們抗戰的後方重要設施，到各校去視察外省情況。這是方開學的第五晚上，天邊正因　着點點的星兒，山國裏晚上的天氣，眞有點春寒料峭的意味，馬路上擾議着來往的行人，霓紅燈放射出它紅綠的光輝。整個的宇宙，已投入了夜神的懷抱裏。記者便在這樣着色蒼茫的黃昏裏，開始了調查的工作。</p>
<p>調查的對象是華山小學：那兒是在市中心區，學校的規模較大，所設的班次也較多，那校裏陳校長對我說，「我們的學校是在市中心區，人口比較稠密，不過公務員和要人們的眷屬，乃多半住在這裏的我們辦學的區城內，這是一件頂麻煩的事，一般的平民，他們也感覺到不識字的痛苦，所以當我們去登記時，他們是很踴躍的來報名參加，希望能夠補償他們過去的損失。而來補習。李於公務員的卷屬們呢！那就太麻繁了，因爲他們家裏的人，大都是讀過書的，只有他們的使女和僕從們才是文盲，可是他們決不願叫僕人或使女來到學校裏補習而躭誤了他們的家裏的工作，因爲這樣的爭執，有時會至口角，或者到傳察那裹去申訴。眞麻煩至無以復加。」他又說：「還有些婦女，借口要分娩，或是不久要結婚的話來搪塞，眞是弄得一個沒有辦法。又有一部分是調查好了的，但是開學時，并不來上課，去根究他時，不是回答到外縣疏散：便是說這個工人我們已經　退了。但我們還是本着服務社會的精神做去，來補救他們。」這時男男女女的學生，陸續地來了。他又繼續道一「在這些補習的學生裏，除了少數的能自動來上學外，大多數的學生，都是三方五次催促才來的。我們把學校裏原有的學生分配好了，每一個邀約一個夜校的補習學生，有些一約便來了，有些呢！還受他們家裏的老爺太太們打罵。而哭啼着回校裏來。…………。」</p>
<p>談到這裏，似乎陳校長的話還沒有談完，因爲時間的關係，記者便請他　着到課時裏去參觀。</p>
<p>出了校長室，一陣的微風欠來，使人欣感到一綫涼意。走到距離教室一百步附近的時候，耳裏便充滿了叫　的聲音，雜着乳孩啼哭和嘻的笑音調。眞是一支幽揚的教窒進行曲。到了窗外，向裏面對去。她們芷在教國文。約算是四十多人的光景，但是一百多的坐位，是全坐滿了，有些還沒有坐位，着站讀書。因爲這班完全是婦女，其中有一部份學生，年齡在二十八九歲的，每人都帶了一個或兩個小孩在她們旁邊坐着。又有些沒有出閣的閩女，爲了深夜來往的不便。特地由母親或弟妹伴着來　書，或者又因爲是人家的使女或乳娘，不能不帶着她們的小姐和少爺到學校眞來讀書，所以雖然學生僅僅只有四十多人，面坐位都完全佔滿了。其中有摩登奇裝的少婦，有溫存文雅的閨女。也有頂着布帕的村姑，或者污　不堪的使女。形形色色，充滿各層階級的代表，有的人還借着這機會帶着毛線去織衣服，又有些是帶了衣服去補縫。要使你要干涉她的話，她便囘答你是爲了生活問題，不做就沒有飯吃，眞使她們學校當局，沒有法子可以禁止她們。還有那大大小小的孩子們，跑來跑去的玩耍，若是上面的教師加以于涉時，那麼馬上哭聲震天。所以教師也弄得沒有辦法，只好聽這些小孩們叫鬧了。因爲這些傢伙玩耍着，他們的母親或乳娘。便可以專心讀書。用不驚去關照他們。</p>
<p>當記者走進教室時，上面的一位教師，特地叫了一個學生去默寫。她把國字的口寫起以後，裏面的宇，她却再也寫不下去了，經過了教師再三的催促，她却回答說：「老師，我眞難過，因爲我家裏的門沒有鎖好，怕小偷兒進去偷物件，所以是想不起來了。啊！我心裏眞難過。」這幾句話，眞把一個莊嚴的教師都弄得笑了起來，但是下面的學生當中，有些都是不錯，公然也能讀能寫，這我們又不能不歸於朝夕勤勞的教師們。</p>
<p>第二個教室裏，也是四十多個學生，情形和第一班差不多，裏面有尼姑，同時還有裁縫和皮匠的太太，有一部份是艇婦，這些是特別可憐的下層階級的人兒，她們白天要做勞苦的劃船工作，夜晚要來讀書，不過看她們的表情，都是十分的快樂，大致因爲是感到已由黑暗快要進入光明的緣故，她們是在唱救亡歌曲，這天是因爲開頭第一次，所唱的黨歌，她們都是縮手縮腳地看着。記者喁喁私語，而四十多人唱歌的聲音，還沒有教台上先生一個人的聲音來得大，這大約是羞澀的緣故—因爲她們的談話聲音，是遠在一百步以外，便能聽到了。</p>
<p>第三天晚上參觀的都是景星，那兒有六班學生，其中兩班都是男生，裏面完全是淸一色的人力車夫，他們都來自不同的地方，有的是本省千里外的寄居者，有些都是幾萬里外流浪來的難民，在他們的當中，是代表着我國整個的民族性，也代表着社會上勞動階級的一部份，有的巳是三十多歲，有的却是二十多歲的靑年，但都是因爲沒有讀書的機會，所以永遠是站在勞動的崗位上，整日地過着牛馬般的生活，他們不是沒有國家的親念，而是沒有人去領導他們。據調查的結果，全市共有人力車夫二千三百四十人。除了少數是幼年會紹受過小學教育而外，其餘一千一百多人，都是目不識丁的勞動者，現刻都已分班上課了。他們都是很知道努力，訓練不過是兩星期，公然也能讀能寫，并且現在已是正式的組成了一個大隊，下面又分三個中隊，於課外再加以訓練，使他們在戰時能替國家服務，在最初上課時，聽說是常有規避的事情，後經過一個嚴格的編制，他們卻是不再敢逃學了。</p>
<p>記者參觀到這裏，感對整個民教可以樂觀的，補習的結果，也是很有希望的，市小教師們難然吃了不少的苦。碰了不少的釘子，但他們的代價是很偉大的；不過以邇次的經驗，就是公務人和抗戰將士的家屬裏的使女，眞使他們無法勸導其就學，這點是當局應該注意的，他如教師的責任太大而薪給太少，這也是值得改善的一點，因爲他們旣已盡了服務社會的使命，而當局不給他們一點物質上的安慰，這是最能使人灰心的一點，記者甚盼在第二期開始的時候，教育當局能再來一個統籌計劃，把道次的經騐加入，則第二次的效率必更來得大。</p>

<p>他說、「這次的破壞公路、別人總以爲交通線應當在必要的時候才破壞、在我認爲不然、因爲公路破壞了、×人知道了不會來的、因爲×人的強處、是在他武器的優良、坦克車、裝甲車、重炮、重兵器等、公路破壞了、×人的重兵器不容易來、×人沒有配合　兵器、他是不來的、就是來、那麼他要修路、譬如容墟到容縣、這段路三百里、有公路幾小時就可以到丁、但破壞後、修復要九個月、縱使×人工兵技術好、也得要五個月才能修復、那麼在爭取時間、以達到爭取空間上、我們可以達到消耗×人達到持久戰的目的、但有人說、公路應當到必要時才破壤、事先破壞了、我們不能利用公路來運輸、對于這一說、我們要問現在我們用汽車來運輸送部隊、是否司能、有車以後、是否有汽油、我們現在和×人作戰、自己在自己的地方上地形熟悉、我們知道那點好守、事前就可以將彈藥導輸到那裏去佈置好、作戰時公路固然可以迅速運區　、但破壤後、戰時我們可以將傷兵向兩旁數—里地運送、也可以達到迅速的目的、所以公路若留到必要時才破壞、反而給我利用少、給×利用犬、戰時我雖無公路、但有民衆運輸、×人沒有快子、一切都靠車子運輸、路壞後他便無從運輸、</p>
<p>另外還有一些人、在破壞公路時、只是破壞些橋樑、就算數了、那是不成的、根據一年來作戰的經騐、×人的工兵技術好、材料多、利用橡皮艇橡皮樁來架橋、很快就可以架起橋來渡過他的電兵器的機械部隊、像以上的情形、所以在前綫有些部隊常常吃虧、以爲交通綫橋樑破壞了、就可以放心慢慢地撤退、但結果×人很快修好交通綫、以機械部隊趕來、所以常吃×人的虧、所以公路留到必要時再破壞、難說廣西民衆較有組織、于必要時可破壞、但那時×人飛機來轟炸、民衆走光、在必要時再破壤、談何容易、</p>
<p>現在公路破壤了、×人縱來、他要走路來、同時他的重兵器機械部隊不能來、來的只有步兵可來、步兵來是×人用其所短、路好時×人就可以用其機械化的長處、倘×人步兵來、我們對地形熟界、可以利用我的所長、用游擊戰運動來殲滅×人、</p>
<p>至于在破壞交通綫時、我們對路基是要澈底破壞、將泥挖成水田、但對橋樑是還可以保存的、只有挖泥、因爲交通綫上泥是力的問題、架橋是技術問題、架橋×人技材充足可以易辦、但泥是力的問題、他要一担一祖地挑起來、×人是不會挑泥的、我們民衆不給×人挑泥、縱使×人能挑泥、泥鬆還是不能行駛重兵器機械化的、那他會陷在泥沼裏、所以×人來要修路來、要很久的時間、我們可以爭取持久了、這是我們作戰十四　月所得到的經驗、存上海作戰時、我凝有這個建議了、最好的例子、在浙江各公路綫破壞後、×人目前進攻很困難、九江到南昌的鐵路澈底破壞了、×人的進犯也異常困難、這並不是說×人不想攻下浙江、這是他不易前進、可爭持久、可使民衆安居樂　、可以生產、可以增養新的力量、新的軍隊、所以將近戰區的交通澈底破壞、非僅是阻×進犯、這是和整個持久戰全面戰有密切的關係、和游擊戰運動戰有密切的配合、從持久戰中消耗×人、增加×人經濟恐慌和困難、同時亦是爭取國際環境有利條件的變化、使我們自力更生的培養出新的戰鬥力、準備我們新的反攻力量、」</p>
<p>他說得非常透切明白、記者跟　提出目前北海形勢緊張、×人進犯廣西估計如何、他用悠聞而又沉　的態度囘答肥者、他說、「×人倘進犯廣西、有四條路、一條從北海到南寧、一條從赤坎（廣州灣）到鬱林、一條從西江三水到梧州、一條從廣寧懷集到賀縣、但×軍進攻三水後、將福州出口塞住、悟州等于死市、鬱林至廣州灣、廣寧到賀　的公路破壞後、×人不會來、現在唯有邕欽綫、北海到南寧的路、也許×人企圖切斷我國際路綫　、他接着又說、×人佔領圍洲島、他將獲得一個陸地飛機塲、也許×人會像從前炸廣九路和粤漢路一樣、時時派飛機搗亂、來轟炸廣西的交通綫、這是有可能的、』</p>
<p>接着我們又談了許多問題、韋軍長都很細心的解釋、末了、他很客氣的送我出門外、記者非常高興、對這個問題得到了很精確的認識、（一月廿二的桂林）</p>

<p>這一支力量、在去年上月裏誕生的時候、只不過一個基　總隊、但經過一年來的戰鬥中間、便發展爲目前的堅強龐大的隊伍、這不能不推功于它的政治工作的效力、</p>
<p>像其他的部塚一樣、决死隊最大的任務、在不斷的打擊×人和牽制×人、使建立×人包圍中的呂梁山游擊抗日根據地、逐漸的鞏固與擴大起來、近一年來的游擊戰爭中、從今年二月七、他開始就以無比的英勇、嚴重的打擊了日×的兇亞的圍攻、靠着汾河的同　路、也時常被靑年的决死隊帶着民衆予以無情、破壞、五月間、更配合了津浦線的會戰、極力的牽制着防碍着×人對津浦的增援、六月間　候嶺險峻的山頭、對×人四十餘輛汽車的搗毀、與汽車路的澈底破壞、後×人到今天還沒有完全恢復、交通仍然阻隔、他把×人圍困在鐵路綫上和城專、威脅着×人的行動的自由與種種×行的活動、他們不但大量的殲減了×人和偽軍、並且還用政治宣傳的力量、至常的鼓動偽軍的反正與瓦解、並提高了×　中反戰運動的浪潮、我們看十二月五日在趙城磨頭軍站三十三個為工人反正的事實、便是它們對×工作的實際成績、靑年决死隊英勇戰鬥的精神、巳經傳得了社會人士和抗×友軍好評、尤其印象很深的留在民衆們的腦海裹邊、他們常會以極少的人數、戰敗優良人數衆多的×人、十一月二十一日、他們在霍縣石鼻村曾受到兩千×人的六路進攻、結果他們以十五個英勇戰士、巧妙的打退了了一千×人的四路衝鋒、以二比四十餘的傷亡、使進攻的×人、獲後可恥的慘敗、十一月廿三日、决死隊的一個工作員、以八個新加入而未學軍事訓練的靑年戰士、六支破舊的步槍、去襲擊孝義東郊的×人、除我無些微損失外、還奪囘了數頭馱縣和一匹很漂亮的馬、</p>

<p>除了作戰以外、他們還都學習識字和政治問題、並經常的開問題討論會與生活小組會、彷彿學校一樣、除這些工作外、每一總隊都組織有一個政治工作隊、經常的到隊伍裏去表演戲劇、因而他們還能不斷的看到生動的話劇、活撥的舞蹈、聽到雄壯的歌唱、通俗的鼓詞小調、全體戰士、都愛好着悲壯的歌唱、救亡的歌聲隨着他們傳播到廣大的鄉村、廣大的原野上、</p>

<p>據廿八日倫敦電訊，英國內閣實行局部改組，賈特菲繼任國　大臣，英首相張伯倫發表演說，謂英國今後决尋求國際合作，積極進行整軍，準備應付戰爭。又據同日巴黎電訊，法國鑒於歐洲局勢嚴重，現正積極準備增強國防，並將兵役期限兩年延展至二十七個月。這幾個消息是不是表明了英法兩國當局在德意兩國得寸進尺的威脅下，開始覺悟準備反攻的必要呢？</p>
<p>在德意日三個法西期侵略者瘋狂推進新的帝國主義大戰之際，和平民主國家尤其是英法兩國，只有奮發起來聯合蘇美等國以實力制裁法西斯侵略國家，才能保障其本身安全及其在世界上的固有地位，這是天經地義。然而英法兩國的政權，不操之於英法兩國人民或代表人民的前進政黨，而旁落在少數金融資本家領袖本人及代理人的掌握之中，這些人儘管口頭說得漂亮，爲國爲民爲和平，實際上則與法西斯侵略××合作，藉擴大戰爭以發展財運；他們最反對的便是人民大衆獲得政權，他們最痛嫉蘇聯所給全世界被壓迫大衆的爭取自由幸鷓的前例，他們最不願意和平民主各國聯合起來打倒了法西斯侵略××以後的廣大人民自由幸福的世界，他們害怕到那个時候將沒有獨佔利潤豺富的可能，因此他們無論如何反對民主，反對進步，並目要助長法西斯侵略。</p>
<p>現在英國內閣改組是不是統治者階層的改組？英法的整軍備戰是不是出於制裁法西斯侵略者的决心？當然大可懷疑。至多只是鑒於兩國人民均已有此要求，並且已經凝結成爲一種行動，因此不得不『有此一舉』。我們不是說英法兩國現在沒有採取此種政策的可能，而且認定英法兩國內外形勢正在強迫他們採取進步的以實力保衛民主與和平的政策。不過我們不能單看所謂局部改組和所謂備戰宣言，而要注意到他們制裁法西斯侵略的實際行動，而要組織廣大民衆推動他們實踐這種步驟。</p>

<p>廿八八日倫敦路透社傳出日本當局正在計劃侵沾西沙羣島，道個消息可和意大利遠征軍佔領巴薩龍納一事聯起來看。意大利侵略者在西班牙所以獲勝，甚至今後更將聯合德國法西斯進一步侵略法蘭西本國，完全是法國跟隨妥協外交政策之後對侵略者讓步及以弱小國家行賄的必然結果。這種退讓與賄賂政策在歐洲，固然已經鼓勵了侵略者，同時便不能制止東方侵略者的垂涎—現在日本西征南犯的計劃着着進逼，其目標已經不止爲梧州南甯，而且還包括東京灣印度洋以至南洋全境—佔領西沙羣島只是進軍的一個小小暗示而已。可知要切實保障法國以至英國的遠東權益，首先就得放棄對侵略者退讓與賄賂的政策。</p>

<h3 id="c27">美國一年來　對中日軍火供給比較 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 作者　VIGINA　THOMPSON</p>
<p>保仁譯自十二月廿七日紐約FAR　EASTERN　SURVAY週刊</p>
<p>據最近美國對外貿易局公報，一九三八年美國對遠東軍火的輸出額大減，在中國方面，由於沿海各省均爲日軍占據，重要運輸交通路線截斷，因此軍火無法運往。在日本方面，助因爲美總統羅斯福及國務卿赫爾，勸告各軍火商及飛機廠，勿以軍火，飛機售予日本的結果，故日美間的軍火貿易，這年中，也逐漸減少。</p>
<p>美國輸入中國軍需品（槍械　藥除外）數額，在這一年中，時漲時落，成不規則的現象，第一月中達美金二，五〇〇，〇〇〇元，第二月達二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，到第三月喊爲一五〇，〇〇〇元，可是到　四月，突增至二，五二七，一六一元，破以往未有紀錄，第五月減爲美金五二三，二九八元，第六月略增，值美金一，二三六，〇二〇元，第七月紙值美金一六四，六九八元，第八月值一二二，四四八元，第九，十兩月略爲增加，合計億美金七〇六，一三五元，到第十一月，竟減到美金一，九四九元。</p>
<p>至於說，美國供給中國的實用軍械（檢彈飛機等　情形更壞，一九三八年六月，計值美金二，二一二，〇〇〇元，七月計九三七，〇〇〇元，八月二九九，〇〇〇兀，九月爲九九，〇〇〇元，十月竟滅到四九，〇〇〇美元，以上各數，中國政府大部是用以購買飛機。</p>
<p>在日本方面，無疑的，由於日本不顧國際信義，破壞和平條約，藐視美國在華權益等舉動，引起了美國政府及人民一種根深蒂固的抗日觀念，國內大部份軍火商，多自動對日消極不台作，同時，今年七月間國務卿赫爾屢次聲言，勸阻斷絕侵略者軍火接濟。以經濟的福利，謀國際的相安，經國內權威者登高一呼，對日絕交的空氣，也就日益澎湃起來，在一九三八年一月至六月間，美國每月平均有值美金一百萬元以上，其中有幾個月竟達二百萬元之多，可是到七月，因受赫爾鼓吹制日的應響，運往日本的軍火就大減，現就軍需原料而言。在七月值美金一，一二五，四九三元，到八月　滅全一七九，二四九元，九十雨月更是滅少，計九月值八五，一三八元，十月祇值七八，七二〇兀，十月後，美國所運往日本的軍需品，全是在七月以前日本向美商預先定購的貨物，如果等到合同期滿後，美國輸入日本的軍需品，自然還得減少。</p>
<p>至於美國供給日本的實用軍火（槍械彈藥飛機），更有顯著的減省，在一九三八年穴，七，八月中，平均每月值美金一，二五〇，〇〇〇元，到九月祇值美金六七九，〇〇〇元，十月竟減到三六八，〇〇〇元，而其中減少成份最大的，就是飛機。</p>
<p>我們從上面的貿易數額上，可以得到一個結論，美國對日本不台作，禁運軍火往日本的辦法，已有相當成效，據國務院的報告，在一月至十月間，美國供給中國的實用軍火，雖其交通要道被日人截斷，運輸感受困難，但其總數仍有值美金七，七六〇，三六〇元的實用軍火輸入中國，而在日本，他賺然佔領中國沿海交通要道，美國與日本間的運輸一無阻礙，但其總數也不過九，〇一九，四五八元，與中國相差甚微，要是中國長期抗戰下去，日美間的軍火貿易，勢必一落千丈，成江河日下之勢。</p>

<p>兇手以汽水瓶擊暈該男子後復持切菜菜刀向該傷者亂砍、計頭頗中兩刀、頭部一刀、左臂亦中一刀、各創口均深可見骨、傷者再受此數刀後、傷勢更重、鮮血從創口汨汨流出、滿身若浴于血盤中、此時在該室品茗之其他茶客、見發生血案、紛紛離店他去、而兇手行兇後、仍然鎭靜、面不改容、亦不他逃且自鳴警笛告警、</p>
<p>召警不來　投案自首</p>
<p>不料鳴笛良久、仍不見有警察到場、該兇手乃親往一號警署投條自首、該署當值幫辦據報、以此案情重大、卽出派出大隊中西務探到場查究、並將血案發生之地點、由政府撮影存案、並在店內搜獲兇刀一柄、及汽水樽之碎片、均帶返警署存案、以爲他日研訊時之物證、同時並電消防局派十車到塲、將傷者送人瑪利醫院救治、抵院後、雖經當值醫生極力救治、但仍然昏迷不醒、因流血過多須看傷能否渡語危險時斯後、始能斷定其生命安存與否、至於當時在塲目擊者及該飱室夥伴、及與傷者到該室品茗之女郎、皆被警探傳往警署詢同事發情形存案云、</p>
<p>家散人亡　神經刺激</p>
<p>查該兇手名李炳、現年僅二十餘　、於數月前茶杳室開張時、即受僱爲侍役之職、李家人向居廣州、近日接得其家人來函、謂家庭不幸、因國難受禍、父母兄弟橫遭慘死、李炳得訊、異常悲痛、其神經突受重大刺激、故有此次之兇性勃發也、至茶香室因昨晨店中不幸發生流血慘案後、昨日該室遂致未能繼續啓市營業云、</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<p>在我國這回神聖的抗戰史上，婦女界是佔着光榮的一頁，如趙老太太之組織游擊隊，楊慧敏女十之四行献旗，許許多多的婦女界同胞冒萬險，吃萬苦，在前救護傷兵，慰勞殺×戰士，爲戰地英雄服務，在後方黴募慰勞品，藥物，縫製征衣，參加献金各種各式的籌欵勸募公債等等，都是後卅寫戰史人所應加入，不能遺漏或這忌的史料。</p>
<p>在香港方面，各婦女團體，現仍做着彰彰司考的工作，最近塘西歌姬，爲着中國靑年救護團籌欵，學行第六次義唱，更爲抗戰史上增添可歌頌的一頁一</p>
<p>昨天—「一二八」第八週年之翌日——下午，石塘咀　園酒家三樓中，展開一個令人感舊的塲面，這就是第六次義唱的頒獎盛典。</p>
<p>禮　上懸着總理遺像，伴着交加的黨國旗，中間放着一張棹子，上面陳列着一個瑞璨的皇冕，兩個明星冠，幾具亮閃閃的銀鼎，禮壇兩旁堆滿着鮮艷奪目的花籃，爭研門麗的向着觀衆微笑。前面掛着一幅絲裂而畫着「愛國歌后」的橫額，還有一抗戰尚未成功，捐輸仍須努力」，的小對子，四週充滿着熱烈底園氛。</p>
<p>三時半，在音樂悠揚中，這一幕富有意義的頒獎禮，在百來對視綫下展開，穿救籌團制服而有大丈失概的部德志女士首先站在台上。</p>
<p>主席陳　一，以簡單的話說明歌姬義唱的重大意義，并致謝各方贊助人的盛意。</p>
<p>鄺女士報告義唱籌備經過，對義唱團主席寶玉，美麗麗，萬紅女，多女等幾位女十的熱心與努力，有誠摯的佩頌，寶玉女士是義唱的創始者，在義唱團中有着共通的信仰，其餘幾位是義唱團的台杜，成績的表表者。</p>
<p>老當益壯的革命女傑何香凝女士，有着沉痛而動人的演詞，她說從前我國婦女無地位，國家興亡認與婦女無關；對於歌女歷來更有兩句議諷的話：「商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花」。但是如今却大不同了歌女已醒覺起來，她們不特知道亡國恨，并且起來參加救亡工作，所以這兩句侮蔑歌女的詩句，應得馬上修改，讓我們把它改爲，「歌女熱心齊報國，香港預聽凱旋歌」罷！</p>
<p>在延續的掌聲中，何女士對一般住在安樂高中的太太小姐們，深致殷切的期望：同時布望義唱國諸位女士，繼續發揚其一實的愛國精神，使之在抗戰中發生更大更好的影響！</p>
<p>來賓唐健存以激昂的語調，闡述歌姬羲唱之意義，他說在「七七」抗戰以來，中華女兒有着光榮的偉蹟，塘西歌如六次舉行義唱，供献其所能盡的力量，這種精神，比諸四行献旗的巾幗英雄，同樣可歌可頌，在社會地位上，她們或比不上達官貴人，富商巨賈的太太小姐們，但在國家本位上，她們有着榮譽的光輝，更尼使那徒知塗脂抹粉，醉生夢死，不知國家興亡的人們愧死！</p>
<p>義唱團代表寶玉女士演說措詞文雅而謙遜，她說：「過去六次義唱以第一二兩次成績最好；第一次五千餘元，第二次四千餘元，以後幾次每見愈下。這一次得到鄺德志女士的努力，與乎救護團在救亡工作上的感召，突然回復三千多元的成績，但是，在救亡上，這仍屬杯水車薪，無濟於事，希望富裕的太太小姐們多多出力。」</p>
<p>最後由伍朝樞夫人頒獎，美麗麗，萬紅女，多女，依次被喚步出禮壇前先加冕，後頒發銀鼎，美麗麓一歌國皇后」，披着雪白的皮外樓，蛋形的臉，熨着鴨星型的髮，怡然地接受這榮譽的皇冕。萬紅女態度淑雅而文靜，鼻加上黑眼鏡，像一個受過相當教育的學生，於戴上「紅星」之冠後，於觀衆視線下現出淺笑。多女正像一個小家碧玉，可是披上一件貂鼠皮的外　，不失其「歌國領袖」的風度！</p>

<p>— 柔芝</p>
<p>游擊隊是人民的抗×先鋒同時也是人民的抗×學校。除了幾個中隊和一個特務隊的士兵之外，還有一個政治工作隊，是受總隊的政治部領導指揮而工作的。政治工作隊固然特別注意政治教育與學習，但也要受軍事訓練，必要時也可以持搶作戰，士兵的政治教育是政治部人員負責的，政治工作隊的工作就注重對人民的宣傳與組織：在駐紮的地方，每逢墟期都有墟報出版，受到民衆的熱烈歡迎，然而民衆工作並非專靠政治工作隊負担，各中隊的士兵也沒有放棄這責任，每逢演戲歌詠的時候，政治工作隊的隊員固然參加，各中隊的士兵也是參加的。過去他們已經演了幾次戲，現在他們且已决定每逢墟期都要演出一次，劇本多由他們自己編，演出的成績雖然未必怎樣完美，但效果却很不小。記者到總隊部的那天，恰是他們在墟中七七紀念台演戲的日子，可惜到遲了二點，不能看到他們演出的情形，深以爲憾。聽他們說，那天演出的有一幕「小英雄」，編導兼主演的就是隊兵中一個道地的小英雄，很受人們讀美哩。</p>
<p>由於他們有深刻的正確的政治認識，對政治軍事各方面的知識技術，都能夠自覺的積極學習。他們的晚飯是熱烈而緊張的，討論檢討完了就唱歌高呼口號，更提高了抗戰的情緒。</p>
<p>他們都是努力抗戰的中華民埃的擾秀兒女沒有一個不知道尊重人民的利益，因之對於紀律的運守，完全是自覺的，一點也不勉強的，每一個中隊都有一個中山室，每隔幾天出版一次壁報。互相教育看，勸執着；因爲士兵中有不少進步的智識份于，寫稿與編輯是不成間題的，政治部的人目只加以指導而已。</p>
<p>他們對於體格的鍛鍊也很注意，每日飯晚前都有人打藍球，晚飯後做各種的游戲！多數是有趣味而且有意義的。他們的生活一些也不枯燥！</p>
<p>最特色的是：他們中有十多個女戰士，一部分是政治工作者和救護員，但也有幾惆能文能武的兵士—其中有一個在東完時會勇敢作戰；聽一個相識的兵士對我說，當練習打靶的時候，這位女兵連開三槍都打中紅心，將來眞不難成爲如「第四十一」小說中所寫的那位女神鎗手！</p>
<p>在目前游擊隊的主要任務是：動員民衆，肅淸漢奸，防止土匪活動。幫助政府推行戰時工作，鞏固與擴大本身的組織，提高部隊的戰鬥力。他們有光榮而偉大的前途，誰也不能復畏。不邊政府現時因爲領土破碎，減省了稅捐的收入，對於這支活躍的游擊隊，還不能供給其軍火與糧　過去的紛養完全是靠海員和海外僑胞接濟的。在記者到總隊部以前，海員慰勞團和餘　樂社的工友們都去慰勞過了，送去不少物品，因此棉衣藥品等巳相當夠用。但是來日方長，他們不單要存在，而且還要發展——就是在目前軍氈，膠鞋，雨衣等也還缺乏——對於他們援助援濟仍然是十分需要的。</p>
<p>現在抗戰已轉到第一階段，敵後方的游擊戰爭將成爲主要的作戰方式。關於這一點，似乎還有許多人不大認識了解。因爲不大了解，表現出來的事實，當然是對游擊隊忽視。這是一種很不好的現象。記者當報道之餘，敢請全東江父老兄弟以及海外各地僑胞，對這個民衆武裝的模範——惠寶人民抗×游擊隊——加以最深切的注意！</p>

<p>【重慶通訊】我國政府鑒於欲開發西南西北富源、必先完成交通建設、尤以鐵路爲最重要、因大量貨運、非鐵路不足以担負此重任、交通部决以全力完成鐵路建設、同時修築公路、以爲鐵路之輔助、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>西北西南　原有鐵路</p>
<p>中國之西部包含西北之陜西、　　、靑上海、甯夏、新疆等五省、西南之四川、西　、　州、雲南、廣曲等五省、此十省之士地面積四百九十二萬方公里、人口數總約一萬萬、在鐵路方面、現有三綫、除滇越路成立較早外、其他二綫之完成、亦爲最近數年之事、隴海之潼關西安段、及西安寶鷄段、箇碧石鐵路、　完成於二十五年、三綫合計僅力百公里、此外尚有川北鐵路、其長度不過二十二公里、</p>
<p>成渝鐵路　完成通車</p>
<p>成渝鐵路本爲川漢　路之西段、自川漢鐵路失敗後、擱置達二十年之久、民國二十五年三月、鐵道部運照五中全會之議案、首先籌建成俞路、分八隊測量、自成都至重慶全爲川省物產富饒之區、長凡五　　十三公里、需欵五千萬元、除組川黔鐵路公司收足資本三千萬元外、並由法國銀團承借料欵二千四百五十萬元、於前年二月開工、俟戰事發生後、奉令提前完工、今年春間、卽可通車、</p>
<p>籌建川滇　滇緬兩路</p>
<p>目前正在積極籌劃之新路、爲山滇、滇緬、兩大幹綫、前者自四川敘府至雲南昆明、後者自昆明至緬甸、爲長江與印度　賜之主要交通綫、兩路共長一千五百公里、統歸山滇鐵路公司承建、該公司　本二千萬元、沈昌任川滇鐵路工程局長、　福鈞任滇緬鐵路工程局長、用滇路已開工、限二年完成、　緬路經費、在英貸華　建廣梅鐵路之信用借欵中　　、</p>
<p>湘桂路分　四段興建</p>
<p>湘桂鐵路自粵漢路衡陽站往桂林、柳州、邕甯、龍州、至桂越交界之鎮南關、與滇越鐵路支綫接軌、全路長九百五十公里、分四段興築、以衡陽桂林爲第一段、桂林柳州爲第二段柳州邕甯爲第三段、邕甯鎮南關爲第四段、其　陽桂林段長凡三百公里、需費三千六百萬元、經一年半之工作、已於去年十月一日通車、其餘三段路基已完成、預定今年冬全路通車、</p>
<p>完成寶蘭　寶成兩線</p>
<p>隴海鐵路通全寶鷄後、卽有西上與南下二議、西上者以蘭州爲目標、南下者以成都爲終點、寶成線之經濟價值較大、且爲西南西北兩大鐵路糸統之主要連絡綫、乃決定先行建築、該路長凡五百公里、需欵五千萬元、並經向比國銀公司籌　、自二十五年秋間派隊實施勘測以來、行將開始動工興建、至於寶蘭綫、决俟寶成綫完成後、再行動工興建、</p>
<p>湘黔鐵路　株湘一段</p>
<p>自浙贛鐵路公司擬改中國鐵路公司後、欲將由長沙經貴陽全黨慶之西南鐵路、概歸該公司承辦、此　雖未實現、而湘黔鐵路工程局巳於二十五年六月成立、決定先築株州至湘鄉一段、全路長約一千公里、需建築設備費一萬六千萬兀、自經動工興築後、現在工程已進行至何種程度、尚無所聞、一說該路工程因戰事關係、業巳暫行停頓、</p>
<p>計劃完成　西南鐵綱</p>
<p>以上七綫、共長約五千公里、需款至少五萬萬元、今交通部决以全力先完成寶成、成渝、川滇、滇緬、湘桂、五大幹綫、此五大幹綫長爲三千五百公里、完成之後、西北西南、可以連成一氣、且有國際涌道三綫、一、由昆明出仰光、二、由昆明出海門、三、由柳州出海防、此外並擬以貴陽爲中心、北築川黔在重慶與成渝相連、西修滇黔、在曲靖與川滇相連、東建湘黔、在株州與粵漢相連、南建枚黔、在柳州與湘桂相連、</p>
<p>然後再建　西北各路</p>
<p>再次則以蘭州爲中心、按次建築隴海路之寶蘭段、在賣鷄與寶成相連、包蘭路自蘭州至甯夏冉至包頭、與平綏路　運、甘新路自蘭州經哈密、迪化、至塔城與蘇聯鐵路相連、甘青路自蘭州至西甯、川甘路自隴海路之大水至成都、與寶成、成渝、二路相連、更延長至康定、而完成西北鐵路系統、以上各項計劇、决按步逐漸實施、</p>

<p>城南皋蘭山下之五泉，爲蘭州名勝古蹟之地，相傳漢代大將霍去病拒匈奴於此，因無水可飲，乃以鞭擊石而得泉，泉名分爲掬月泉，摩蒙泉，鞭　泉·甘露泉，患泉，泉水從石中中出，終年不涸，在那處樹林陰翳，茶室數間，唯一消夏之地，泉旁寺院林立，市當浴佛節，蘭州市場，皆移于此，淸靜土頗成熱鬧場，</p>

<p>（本報專訊）南華征實期內、平均計算、兩日一戰、全體球員、非傷則疲、及其歸來、喘息未定、又須出席聯賽、毋怪各人精神頽唐、見球生厭、蓋以血肉之軀、過事劇烈運動、必不能久持也、</p>
<p>昨天南　南以疲乏之師、出戰東方於快活谷中、其後方台柱李天生、因傷足未愈而缺席、麥紹漢及劉慶才、則勉強登塲、以是之故、防衛力量大減、而具前綫之郭英祺、近來體量加重、演出無復前時爽　、（征貿期內、英祺祇參予戰役一次、惟因表演失常、未及半場已退出、）失機數次、擁南派見狀、氣爲之短、羅斗文亦不起勁、遲滯祟事、馮景祥、黎兆榮、及鄧廣森、尚可人意、惟整個前綫之聯絡、因不一致、甚爲散漫、衝刺復不力、常見切中之球、虛擲而無效、宜其不足以取勝矣、</p>
<p>東方以逸待勞、能致勝利、乃事屬偶然、非眞正技術之收穫、蓋全場形勢、南南實常佔優良局面、具未因此反敗爲勝者、純由前綫好盤失機、然東方防衛甚力、頗足稱道也、</p>
<p>依我所見、田南失敗、乃敗於最初陳綫編排之不當、如其由始全終、用梁榮照任正前衛、加強中線力量、則上半時兩球或不致於失也、</p>
<p>東方自晉級以來、計已三屆、在過去三屆中、無一役不爲南南所敗、至昨日始有機　乘、一舉而勝之、洗雪前恥、宜其喜悅莫各、惟從錦標方面着想、東方此勝、徒取快意於時、若他日海軍得成大業、實拜其賜不淺也、</p>
<p>茲核球賬、南南已賽十三次、勝十敗三、續分二十、海軍已賽十四塲、勝十和三敗一、續分廿三、比較南南、超出一分、此後南南須每役必　、方有可爲、否則錦標將非其有矣、</p>
<p>人有以昨大南南被挫而懊喪、我則以南南小敗爲可幸、假如此役南南所遇者非東方、而是別一外隊、誠恐疲乏之南南、非大敗不止、</p>
<p>總之、東方乃機會之勝利、非技術之勝利、其前鋒演出、實甚平庸、捨侯澄滔外、他無足道、蓋對此勞而不整之南南守衛、猶不能多取、適足見其攻力非強矣、</p>

<p>再十分鐘、　澄滔來犯、南華又失一城、　南派見狀、　常懊喪、如何、黎兆榮截得來球、一舉而入、「睦叔」喜極、引吭高呼黎兆榮、掌聲隨起、</p>
<p>東方佔勝在先、軍心大定、許竟成賣個破綻、趁火打劫、某迷哥大呼「四毫子」、可惜球射過高、否則許又多一注收入、</p>
<p>休息時間、馮景祥蹲坐草坪上、漫談戰情、一小童趨前呼「二叔」、詢問「何不濟乃爾」、二叔惟笑面不答、</p>
<p>包家平語人日、「所負兩球、乃內衛不慎、非吾之罪也、</p>
<p>李惠堂檢閱戰情、亦謂「內衛站立位置不適宜」、下半場時因　李國威退守後防、而以梁榮照居中堅、陣勢經此改善、節節進攻、屢屢扣關、奈何劉項漢、表演出色、化險爲夷、</p>
<p>黎兆榮盤球直上、兇悍異常、劉始纘攔住一腳、黎乃向前栽倒、火星直買也、</p>
<p>東方反攻、侯澄滔領球前進、麥紹漢擋住來路、變雙互鬥機智、老麥因搶險、受創倒地、老侯乃再截球命射、越網而過、失此大機、老侯頽然、</p>
<p>牛仔「曾仲雲」、把守大寨、甚有路數、羅斗文欲賺人關、雙雙糾纏、滾作一團、惹得球迷　呵大笑、</p>
<p>最後十分鐘、南南諸將力攻、東方門前、異常險惡、混亂間、曾仲雲一腳解圍、李德棋接獲來球、舉足一蹴、竟擺「烏能陣一幸他不是內衛、而是前、</p>
<p>南南雖環攻、但無建樹、黎兆榮乃與郭英棋對調位地、亦無隙可乘、卒以一比二見負、東方諸將、莫不歡躍、惟陸叔扶拐杖、垂頭喪氣、面有不愉之色、且向人述及廣州之陷、乃陷於漢奸、弦外之昔、實強人索解也、　（落霞）</p>

<p>【本報特訊】界限街球場上、士葛再戰警察、第一週成三比二、蘇兵得獲勝利、昨日二次碰頭、士葛因鄧勤受傷、戰力削弱、結果竟以二比一之成續敗陣、</p>
<p>是役戰事、無精彩演出、警察演來、餐打蠻幹、威風滿場、蘇兵亦不示弱、硬來硬抵、以牙還牙、結果演成一幕「肉搏」戰、</p>
<p>上半塲蘇軍勞盛、着着佔先、荷息一陳衝刺、打開紀錄、以一比零領前、下半時警察越來越勇、威風八面鄧勤因是受傷、被昇離場、侯律文貴、乘此機會接一連二、打進兩球、後來居上、以情勢論、蘇軍實力、確比警察較高、若非鄧勤受傷、勝利當可穩　、不幸竟失敗、非戰之不力、戰情如后、</p>
<p>士葛乙以七比一大勝警察會後、甲組登場、慶士缺席、莊士頓再作馮婦、中路領導、兩翼推進、奇勒陳兵以迎、攔途截劫掠、遠傳前綫、</p>
<p>文奴截獲、　交中央、荷息馬不停　、盜過光裕跟前、隨卽拔腿　　、派　未防有此一着、搶救不及、愕然變色、河山不、士葛射入此　、爲時距開賽不過三分鐘、中圈再來、警察意外失守、情有不甘、大舉反襲、合力追擊、奈前鋒聯絡疏散、失機頻頻、侯律改　遠射、又有鄧動撲出、望門興嘆、</p>
<p>無何、士葛囘師反向、再度急攻、荷息射中橫柱、爲挪夫救去、麥當奴盤前、與敵翼會生誤會、勢將用武、後爲球證警告、事乃平息、上半場終士葛以一比零佔先、</p>
<p>易陣再戰、警察越來越勇、聲勢汹汹、士葛陣地被園、滿城風雨、未幾、畢力頓送球門前、警察前　　湧而至、侯律一馬當前、球到人到、頂球入網、而鄧動亦于斯際受傷倒地吟呻、昇出塲外救治、以後未見復出、守門一職由馬素路替代、無異創弱守力、警察更爲得勢、乘機進迫、一邊蠻幹、一邊硬拒、肉血相搏、烟火氣滿場、混戰中文貴於人業中偷射、為素路救弗及搶救、遂以二比一敗陣、陣容如后、　（固本）</p>

<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>我們都不能斷定那一種運動是最適宜女子的運動，因爲我們並沒有巴各種運動和遊戲對于女子的影響，經過長時期試騐之後，作一個精密的統計。從這個統計中，我們對於各種身體活動的影響　可以得到一個顯明的分析。但是各種身　活動不僅對於青年女子有很大的影響，對於她們的將來，如母親時代，以及她們的子女也有很大的影響。所以這種統計的工作實在是很難完成的。</p>
<p>肌肉系統過於發達和堅硬對於女子是不很適合的。她們的身體最重要的就是柔軟，平滑的曲線和輪廓。她們的身體之所以需要這些要素並不是完全爲了「美」。其實女子的身體精造與男子不同，倘若作　當的運動，　們的肌肉絕不會發達得和男子一樣，女子雖然也是有強大的體力，但是適宜於女子的就是「健而不顯」的體格，「健」當然包括強大的體力而言。</p>
<p>在今日文明時代的生活中，我們每日必須作有系統和規定的運動，方能獲得眞正的健康。女子的運動雖然不可過於劇烈，時間也不可過久，但最適宜於女子的運動也是要相當費力的。普通最適宜於女子的運動就是動作和諧的柔軟體操，在這種　操之中，最好參以一兩種急捷和比較劇烈的動作，或是那些需要用力把一個姿勢保持數秒鐘的運動。</p>
<p>那些能夠糾正身體姿勢。或使體內多餘的脂肪組織逐漸消失的運動，以及各種糾正運動（Corrective　Movememts）等對於女子都很適宜，但是當這種運動已達到目的之後，應即廢止，不好再繼續。</p>
<p>凡有下列各種情形的運動，對於女子都是極不適宜的：（一）劇重的打擊，衛　，仆跌，以及因跳躍猛烈，以致身體落地時受有重大的震動。（二）運動時身體須互相接近。（三）需要強大的耐力，或對於心，肺各部主要器官有重大的影響。（四）須出全力的運動。</p>
<p>所以，足球，拳擊，摔角，舉重，長途或越野賽跑，賽船等運動都不宜於女子。　（一）</p>

<p>發球其實有一種一定的輕易方法、在未發球前、你應先向塲後行出約十尺、然後向你發球應立的地方行回來、到達應立的底綫點時、你便應作發球的準備、左腳的腳尖應向着你思發球到達之點、右足略略橫站在左足之後、能離得遠些更妙、但以自然爲宗旨、肋和肩要作四十五角度的斜度、這是在右方發球的方法、如果在左方發球、腳尖自然也要對準球之達到點、但肋與肩却要作個九十度的傾　、</p>
<p>如果你要改正發球最易犯的錯誤點的話、最要的便是要將球擲到你有準備得好好打出的時間的高度、使你有時間　量地把球拍繞向身後去、更姿注意到球　必過網及打達開球界盡處之可能、其次、則擲球時宜略偏于身右而在身之前、切不可把球地到頭之後去、（但要打出向外旋轉之球則又不同）至於擲球、也有其一定之無誤方法、如果你於打出時、覺得身段被逼斜向後方、你便應知道球已擲得太後、如果打出時身段突向左傾、你便應明瞭球已擲得傾左了、倘若你於打出時、覺得上衣和裙俱因一擊而被牽動、這便是證明你所擲起的球巳夠高度了、</p>
<p>平打的空中欄擊法巳逐漸爲多數女網球家所採用了、我們最近的三位男冠軍——梵恩斯、潘　、勃琪——都曾採明此法、而我也視此法爲比空中斬球法爲可靠而更爽脆且有勁力及準繩、對於此法我又有兩種貢獻、打時手腕要緊緊鎖着、如果用正手迎擊、則宜待球至左腳前擊出、用反手則應待球到達右足前擊出、打出時身要偏側向綱、平打的空中關擊是不用作由後擊出之準備的、實際上只要向前一頂便足、其勢應和正反手抽擊的餘勢同、至於攔擊低球、將球拍的平面打出法應與迎擊平肋或平肩的來球無異、不過擊底球時、球拍應有拖向網頂的餘勢以求球必過網罷了、若果你要在　擊時打出死球或有角度而斜飛之球、便自然要出於斬球之一法、但在我、則以爲當上網時、仍以平面攔擊爲較宜、</p>

<h3 id="c55">落日 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>——戰地旅行雜感</p>
<p>友人珂雲有一篇「廢　落日」的戰地報告文，寫那天在劫後台兒莊郊外蒼茫夕照中的情況，結末一節寫道：</p>
<p>從麥田中繞回城內，有一狗屍，躺在斜坡上；相　數上步，又有二</p>
<p>×屍，仰臥在泥地上，上身掩蓋着黃泥，只剩兩腿露在外面，腳上還套</p>
<p>着膠皮靴。一抹落日的餘光走他的身上掠過。這印象在我們的心頭不待浮了起來×兵的一首詩：</p>
<p>我們爲什麼而戰？</p>
<p>支那人受了磨劫，</p>
<p>我們也遭了災雞，</p>
<p>天哪，天那！</p>
<p>誰來收拾我們的殘骨？</p>
<p>這詩也不時響在我們的耳邊。這詩的情調和「蒼茫落照一的情調會這麼和諧，在我們那一剎那的靈感上覺得非常繁異。有一天晚上，我獨自在上饒北門外看落日，又觸起這一番景象，忽覺得這情調實在太熟習了；我恍然大悟，這是世紀末的情調。——貫澈×人一切用文字來記戰的詩文中的基本情調。</p>
<p>昨天忽翻開日本空海和尚所作伊呂波歌歌句云</p>
<p>紅紫芳菲兮　零奈何？</p>
<p>徧觀人世兮常住幾多，</p>
<p>幻境沈迷兮而今超過，</p>
<p>殘夢已醒兮弗醉弗　。</p>
<p>原來　漫於日本民族心理上的，就是這一套末世紀的情調。語云：「日暮途窮，倒行逆施，」日本軍閥的侵略狂，原來只是一種世紀末心理所演奏的倒行逆施篇。</p>
<p>日本軍閥每一個人，都是弗洛伊德的精神病院中的好材料：這句話，我們站在日本民衆那一邊，除去一切民族偏見，纔能深切地理解。在日本那一方面，雖說有『日出之國』或『朝日』這一類自況的詞句，但支配日本這國家命運的貴族與軍閥，無論　這制度的本身成就××這系統講，都已臨到丁『落日』或『世紀末』的命運了。</p>
<p>中日戰事的結局，會變成怎樣一個局面，日本統治階級及軍閥都已深切知道了：這戰事决不會給日本民衆以黑色的命運，日本統治階級及軍閥却將與德俄統治階級把臂進博物院去，這是日本軍閥各式掙扎姿態的總說明。</p>
<p>當歐洲大戰初起時，沙皇簽定宣戰那一剎那，他非常悲慘地說：『對我的可怕的試驗　决定了，可是我這一世得不到報　的了。』從歐洲大戰過程中，解放了舊俄地獄下的民衆，結束了沙皇這一系統的命運：眞使××對落日而激起怎麼的戰慄啊！</p>

<p>也想寫幾篇超絕的大作，</p>

<p>如今實在祇有，你先生一人！</p>
<p>（附註）不久之前，重慶文壞會發生過一次很熱鬧，狠激烈的筆戰。事淸的起因和經過，大概是這樣的—梁實秋，在接編中央日報副刊的第一天，就在『編者的話』那篇文章裏面，大肆攻擊他心目中的所謂『抗戰八股』，徵求『與抗戰無關』的文稿；一時，住在重慶的作家們都大爲不滿，力持異議，于是，一塲筆墨官司就開始了，足足鬧了一兩個月，才告結束。參加此次論戰的，除梁氏外，前後計有姚蓬子，沈起予，金滿成。陳白　，宋之的……等等。這首詩（假如也配稱爲詩的話），正是當兩方論爭得頂熱鬧的時候寫成的。因爲恐怕外地的讀者不懂，特加註釋如上。</p>

<p>現在天寒了，母親總喜歡沐浴在白日的陽光之流裏，得來一點浪暖，假若一天天陰了，那你應該舉起你底雙拳揭開烏烟般的雲幕，蹊靑的天白的日，照紅了大地。</p>
<p>你的靑春，你的快樂，你的幸福，你的智慧，你的前程，你的光明，你的壯志……以及你的一切呵！不要在母親的珠淚裏面喪失了。</p>
<p>母親在閒暇時，常談起岳飛的故事，她是怎樣地欽佩伍武穆的忠勇！你如果要博得母親的歡心的話，那你就整好旗鼓，在自由的火花下，登上露天的舞台，去扮演岳飛的故事吧！</p>
<p>在全國民衆慶祝全面抗戰勝利的一天。你戴着自由的榮耀的軍冠囘來，當你走到站在碼頭上遙望着愛兒凱旋歸來的母親的慈懷之前時，你應該微笑着說：「母親！你的愛兒帶着自由回來了。」</p>
<h3 id="c58">「靈感」 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 求眞</p>
<p>蘇聯作家M，左東克，在他的」我怎樣寫作」中說：</p>
<p>「…我有兩種工作方法。一種方法是：什麼時候有了靈感，什麼時候我便以創作的衝動去寫。這時候工作淮行得很輕快，又沒有缺點。全部的圖面，全部的事物的結構，都在自然而然中組成了。</p>
<p>「第二種方法是當沒有靈感的時候。遇到這樣的場合，我便以技術的訓練去寫。在這種工　方法上，我像通常由港意識所做的那樣去做：自己建起主題的計劃，自已適當地處置每一段和每一個字，由字，演成故事。……」</p>
<p>不過，他到後又更進一步說，「它（　感）對於作家，對於作家的全部工作楚一種唯一的要素。技術固能都助靈感，能補充靈感的不足；也能代替靈感，—有了技術，也能終於不致低墜了自已的質量；然而若永還沒有任何樣的靈感、那個作家一定無法去得到深遠的進境。」</p>
<p>『靈感』之所以爲文藝寫作時不可缺少的要案，不但爲了便於寫作！以一般經驗而論，有了靈感的衝動而寫作，的確要寫得輕快而且圓滿；並且更是爲了文藝這東西，在形象的表現之中，必得蘊藏着動人的情緒，它是借了形象，通過了感性，而後轉入到認識中去的，作家的認織陪伴着情感血迸寫出的創作，才能予讀者以「共嗚」，發生文藝的效用，如果沒有眞實情感的話，那末無論作家的世界觀怎樣地正確，技術怎樣地熟練，他所寫出的，至多是原則的說明，形象的摹寫，它總是死的，沒有感染性的東西，所謂「公式主義」所謂「八股」除掉由於技巧的毛病外，作者的沒有靈感，也是一大原因。</p>
<p>然則什麼叫做『靈感』呢？左東克認爲『靈感是肉體健康，心力，神經活潑和堅定自信的一種幸福的結合，這種給合將自己的全部能力投送到一處地方！在一個場合—在文學中。』</p>
<p>這個解釋不大明瞭，我認爲，所謂「靈感」，是認織和情感的結合，也就是意織的衝動，它決不是像一般人所誤認天上掉下來的虛無飄渺的聖靈，而是在生活實踐中與事物有所交涉而生產的精神狀態，所以靈感也是現實的產物。離開了現實，那它便是空洞的，虛偽的。</p>
<p>樣樣看來，作家們就不用因爲沒有靈感而發愁。只要你去接觸現實，去體騐生活，深入到你所要描寫的社會中去實踐，去領會，那末，銀着你的正確的世界觀或認識而來的，一定會有許多不同景況的正義感發生。要這樣地去追求和把握着靈感而寫作，才能寫得眞實，有感染性，而得讀者的共嗚。</p>
<p>光有認識和題材，而生吞活剝地寫出來，終究要使人讀來覺得牽強的；因為這雖然不一定就是文字的游戲，也到底不曾做到文藝的眞實。作家們應當把認識還原到現象中去，把題材還原到現實中去，—就是，要去實踐生活，以使認識和題材經過自己所由勃生的情緒的鍛鍊而融化，具體而成爲眞實的靈感，然後寫將出來，這才好。</p>
<p>當然，倘若已經具有這樣靈感的人，寫作起來就更容易成功了。我希望他們能　大膽地多多寫作。</p>

<p>通過樓下，後面才是眞正的孔廟·中國式瓦房，正殿上掛滿了金碧輝煌的區額，可是那房角却場得漏下一堆灰土；東西配房長了高高的蒿草，屋于歪斜得只消刮過一陣大風就會傾倒的，從那漏洞塌的破缺口處，雀子們飛進飛出，往來無阻。從前的學子，據說加倍愛護生物，那麼，在這帶七十二大賢的偏房，引得麻雀做窩，他們在天之靈應該表出歡迎的吧？</p>
<p>遙想當年，孔夫子坐着馬車，各處奔走，倒眞不是一件容易的事情，比起我們的行軍，雖然盡是用腿走路，但精神方面還算快活；至於孔老夫子，雖然坐在軍中，可以免去身體的疲憊，可是一想到處處　壁，在政治舞台找不到出路，而不得不用講學慰藉自已的苦惱，眞是相差天灘！</p>

<p>這一天，隊伍在舊河街宿營。這小鎮，外面還有一層圍牆，和沿路所有鎮市一樣，在鎮外的近旁，有碉堡聳立在靈端，圍牆和碉樓，在從前都是爲人民保衛治安的所謂堅固的防守綫：可是現在是一個武裝同志的影子都不見了，不論是碉樓上圍牆邊。</p>
<p>在入街的門洞兩旁，紙寫的標語把所有的空地給佔滿了，貼得一層層的，好像給圍牆穿了幾件衣裝。到街里一看，到處叫你感到的全是太平景象，打麻將的，談閒天的，抽水烟的，——夠消閒了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Where Does Japan's Confidence in Long-Term Warfare Lie? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives regarding policy towards China, stated that Japan would never change its established policy towards China, and that even if a third party were to impose economic pressure on Japan, Japan had already prepared countermeasures. The reason the Japanese House of Representatives raised questions about policy towards China was to express the Japanese people's anxiety and disappointment regarding the invasion of China, but Hiranuma's response still indicated that the Japanese fascist military clique would stubbornly go its own way.</p>
<p>Japan, a small island nation, combined with its holdings of Korea, Taiwan, and Southern Sakhalin, amounts to only over 670,000 square kilometers of land and over 97 million people, with extremely scarce agricultural and mineral resources. To maintain a ten-year war against China, or even a hundred-year war, and even to not hesitate to fight a third country, is truly nothing more than mad barking and delusional ravings. In the past nineteen months of the Sino-Japanese War, there have already been signs that Japan's manpower is unable to continue supporting the war effort. The new troops recently dispatched to China are mostly young soldiers with poor eyesight, and various mechanized units are mixed with many fascist European comrades. As for the recent reports that the Japanese military intends to extend the service period of the army and navy in China, and the recent active recruitment of Chinese vagrants and bandits to implement a policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, these are even more ironclad proof of the emptiness of Japan's domestic manpower.</p>
<p>Economically, Japan is even more extremely weak. At the beginning of this year, Japanese public opinion expressed optimistic views on Japan's past economic situation, boasting of the strength of its economic foundation, which could bear the dual tasks of "fighting" and "construction." Such optimistic public opinion cannot deceive the Japanese people, nor can it deceive international observers. Just looking at its most critical finance and foreign trade, one can see that Japan's economy has reached the point of total collapse.</p>
<p>First, let's look at Japan's finances: In the previous fiscal year, general expenditures and special military expenditures for the invasion of China amounted to approximately 6.03 billion yuan. In the past fiscal year, this increased to over 8.04 billion yuan. This fiscal year, according to reports, general expenditures are over 3.69 billion yuan, and special military expenditures are 5.4 billion yuan, totaling over 9 billion yuan. With last year's income of only 1 billion yuan, Japan is already showing signs of being unable to bear the burden. Comparing general income and expenditure, monthly expenditure consistently exceeds income by 300 to 500 million yuan. To fill this deficit, Japan can only rely on issuing public bonds, increasing new taxes, and inflating the currency, doing its utmost to exploit the people. However, all three of these methods have now reached the saturation point. Of the 4.3 billion yuan of public bonds issued last year, only 3.6 billion yuan were sold. The increase of 230 million yuan in new taxes has already made the people consider the "one dish, one soup" principle to be a luxury. The year-end issuance of 2.85 billion yuan in paper currency, while indeed creating an unprecedented record for Japanese paper currency issuance, does not even include the large amount of military scrip and counterfeit money issued in China. In that case, with this year's 9 billion yuan in expenditures, at this time of impoverished people and exhausted resources, I am afraid that there is no other way to go but down the road to bankruptcy!</p>
<p>Next, let's look at Japan's foreign trade: Japan's foreign trade is the lifeline of Japan's various industrial sectors. In the first eleven months of last year, exports were 2.39 billion yuan, and imports were 2.38 billion yuan, resulting in an import surplus of over 10 million yuan. Japan considers this to be the best phenomenon during wartime. In fact, this import surplus phenomenon in Japan is caused by its invasionary military force. Last year, Japan's trade with the so-called Japanese currency bloc in puppet Manchukuo and North China increased by 40% in exports and 18% in imports compared to the previous year. However, in terms of exports and imports to Europe, America, and other countries, there were decreases, and there was still a continued import surplus, and the degree of deterioration was even more severe than before. Therefore, the Japanese government feels that the power of trade control is not enough, and also wants to promote various export trade promotion policies. Now, Japan's foreign trade, both exports and imports, is entirely aimed at military needs under government control. As a result, a large amount of gold is constantly flowing out, and general non-military industries in the country are generally declining. Although the increase in other commodity prices and the unemployment of labor cannot fully reveal the true situation under the supervision of the economic police, judging from the phenomena that have been revealed, there is already a tendency to move towards the road of deterioration.</p>
<p>Regardless of manpower or material resources, Japan has no possibility of long-term warfare. What Japan now hopes for is, on the one hand, to obtain raw materials and food for long-term warfare from China, such as oil, coal, and iron from the Northeast, cotton and wool from North China, and rice and grain from the Yangtze River basin, which are currently being plundered as much as possible. On the other hand, it hopes to continue to be able to sell Japan's main products to the United Kingdom, the United States, and their colonies, thereby obtaining a supply of raw materials and military supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, as long as China can break Japan's economic control forces in the guerrilla areas, and the United Kingdom and the United States can implement economic retaliation against Japan, then the dream that Japan boasts of being able to cope with long-term warfare will be seen to be shattered with the collapse of its national power.</p>
<h3 id="e2">A Visit to a People's School in Kunming <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— (Special Kunming Correspondent of This Newspaper) Mu Lin</p>
<p>The severe cold of winter is quickly passing. The biting north wind has gradually reduced its power. The weather in the mountain country has gradually warmed up, camellias have bloomed in the wilderness, and birds have gathered to compose a song of returning spring. A gentle spring breeze brushes against the withered grass and trees, this is the time when the earth returns to spring!</p>
<p>The beginning of a new year, the renewal of all things, this is precisely because of the loveliness of the spring breeze, so everything on the earth has entered a new stage at this time, and more than 20,000 illiterates here, at this time, a part of them have also followed the spring breeze into the embrace of nurturing rain.</p>
<p>They and she, all because of the impermissibility of the environment, have reached the age of sixteen, and still have not read books. In fact, they are not willing to degenerate, unwilling to read books: but the domestic education has become aristocratic, so although you have stepped over the stage of going to school, you are still illiterate. Now, in order to support this long-term war of resistance, and to mobilize the organization of the rear masses, the existence of this large number of illiterates is no longer allowed in society. Therefore, the domestic education authorities, in addition to compulsory education, are further advocating this great mass education.</p>
<p>The plan for mass tutoring here was started as early as December of last year, but because of the overall planning, it was necessary to mobilize a large amount of manpower and financial resources, so it had to go through a long period of preparation. During this period, with the assistance of people from all walks of life, and the efforts of the education authorities, and with the Ministry of Education and the Education Department allocating considerable funds, it was not until December 17 that publicity began. From the 18th, more than 300 teachers from the city's primary schools conducted door-to-door investigations all day long, and it was not until December 26 that this messy account was investigated clearly. There are more than 20,000 illiterates in the entire Kunming City—from the age of sixteen to forty, of which women account for two-thirds. If compared with the population of the entire city, then it accounts for about one-tenth. Judging from this, we know that it is impossible to organize them without tutoring. After careful planning, they are divided into four phases, with 5,000 people tutored in each phase. The tutoring period is two months. The first phase stipulates that dropouts from the age of sixteen to thirty are to be designated at the Municipal Huashan, Dongsheng, Wucheng, Jinghong, Taoyuan, Xianhe, Shangyi, Guchong Anlan, Jukui, Qianwei, Jingxing, Guxiang, Wei Yuan, Zhongai, Chongren, Shulin, Yiguo, Xinqiao, Nanqiang, Wuxi, Yuantong, Dianfeng, Chenghua, Cuihu, Lianhua, Daguan, Xilin, and other 28 primary schools to be responsible for establishing people's schools for training. Under such organization, after many difficulties, this mass remedial education was finally realized on January 15.</p>
<p>Because the reporter is concerned about the important facilities in the rear of our war of resistance, he went to various schools to inspect the situation in other provinces. This was the fifth night after the start of school, and the sky was dotted with stars. The weather in the mountain country at night has a bit of the meaning of early spring cold. The streets were noisy with pedestrians coming and going, and the neon lights radiated their red and green light. The entire universe has been cast into the embrace of the night god. The reporter began his investigation work in such a colorful and vast twilight.</p>
<p>The subject of the investigation was Huashan Elementary School: it is located in the city center, the school is larger in scale, and there are more classes. Principal Chen of that school said to me, "Our school is located in the city center, and the population is relatively dense, but most of the families of civil servants and dignitaries live here in the area where we run the school. This is a very troublesome thing. Ordinary people also feel the pain of being illiterate, so when we went to register, they were very enthusiastic to sign up and participate, hoping to compensate for their past losses. And come to tutor. As for the relatives of civil servants! That's too troublesome, because most of the people in their families have read books, and only their maids and servants are illiterate, but they are determined not to let their servants or maids come to school to tutor and delay their work at home, because of such disputes, sometimes there will be quarrels, or they will go to the police to complain. It's really troublesome to the point of being indescribable." He also said: "Some women make excuses to give birth, or to get married soon to prevaricate, which is really impossible. Some have been investigated, but they don't come to class when school starts. When we investigate him, he doesn't answer that he has been evacuated to other counties: or he says that we have already dismissed this worker. But we are still doing it in the spirit of serving the society to remedy them." At this time, male and female students came one after another. He continued, "Among these tutoring students, in addition to a few who can come to school automatically, most of the students are urged three times and five times before they come. We have distributed the original students in the school, and each one invites a night school tutoring student. Some come as soon as they are invited, and some are scolded and beaten by their grandfathers and wives at home. And crying and returning to school. …………."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, it seems that Principal Chen's words have not been finished, because of the time, the reporter asked him to lead him to visit the class.</p>
<p>Out of the principal's office, a gust of breeze was lacking, making people feel a chill. Walking about a hundred steps away from the classroom, the ears were filled with shouting sounds, mixed with the cries of babies and the laughter of hi. It is really a quiet and melodious teaching conducting music. When he arrived outside the window, he faced inside. They are teaching Chinese. About forty people or so, but more than one hundred seats are all full, and some do not have seats, and they are reading while standing. Because this class is entirely women, some of the students are 28 or 9 years old, and each one has one or two children sitting next to her. Some unmarried women, for the inconvenience of going back and forth late at night. They are accompanied by their mothers or younger siblings to study, or because they are other people's maids or wet nurses, they have to bring their young ladies and young masters to school to study, so although there are only forty students, the seats are all completely occupied. Among them are fashionable and strangely dressed young women, gentle and elegant ladies. There are also village girls wearing cloth turbans, or dirty and unbearable maids. All kinds of colors, full of representatives of all levels, some people also take this opportunity to bring yarn to weave clothes, and some bring clothes to mend. If you want to interfere with her, she will answer that you are for the sake of living, and if you don't do it, you won't have food to eat, which really makes the school authorities unable to prohibit them. And those children, big and small, run around playing, if the teacher above interferes, then there will be a cry in the sky immediately. So the teachers have no way to do it, so they have to listen to these children shouting. Because these guys are playing, their mothers or wet nurses can concentrate on studying. Don't be surprised to take care of them.</p>
<p>When the reporter walked into the classroom, a teacher above specially called a student to dictate. She wrote the mouth of the Chinese character first, but she could no longer write the words inside. After the teacher repeatedly urged her, she replied: "Teacher, I am really sad, because the door of my house is not locked properly, and I am afraid that thieves will go in to steal things, so I can't remember it. Ah! I am really sad in my heart." These few words really made a solemn teacher laugh, but among the students below, some are good, and they can read and write publicly, which we can't but attribute to the hardworking teachers day and night.</p>
<p>In the second classroom, there are also more than forty students, and the situation is similar to that of the first class. There are nuns inside, and at the same time, there are wives of tailors and cobblers, and some are boat women. These are the particularly pitiful people of the lower class. They have to do hard rowing work during the day, and come to study at night, but looking at their expressions, they are very happy, probably because they feel that they are about to enter the light from the darkness, they are singing songs of national salvation, because it is the first time to sing the party song, they are all shrinking and looking at it. The reporter whispered, and the voices of more than forty people singing were not as loud as the voice of the teacher on the stage. This is probably because of shyness—because their talking voices can be heard from a hundred steps away.</p>
<p>The third night's visit was all Jingxing. There are six classes of students there, two of which are male students. Inside, they are all rickshaw pullers of pure color. They all come from different places. Some are residents of this province thousands of miles away, and some are refugees who have wandered thousands of miles away. Among them, they represent the entire national character of our country, and also represent a part of the working class in society. Some are more than 30 years old, and some are youths in their 20s, but because they have no opportunity to study, they will always stand at the post of labor, and live a life like cattle and horses all day long. It is not that they have no relatives in the country, but that no one leads them. According to the results of the investigation, there are 2,340 rickshaw pullers in the city. Except for a few who had received elementary school education when they were young, more than 1,100 others are illiterate laborers, and they are now divided into classes. They all know how to work hard. The training is only two weeks, and they can also read and write publicly. And now they have officially formed a large team, and below they are divided into three squadrons, and they are given further training outside of class, so that they can serve the country in wartime. It is said that there are often evasions when they first go to class. After a strict establishment, they no longer dare to skip school.</p>
<p>The reporter visited here and felt optimistic about the entire people's education. The result of the tutoring is also very hopeful. The city's primary school teachers have suffered a lot and hit a lot of nails, but their price is very great; but with this experience, it is the maids of civil servants and the families of anti-Japanese soldiers that really make them unable to persuade them to go to school. This is a point that the authorities should pay attention to. If the teacher's responsibility is too great and the salary is too small, this is also a point worth improving, because they have already fulfilled the mission of serving the society, and the authorities do not give them a little material comfort, this is the point that can make people discouraged the most. The reporter very much hopes that at the beginning of the second phase, the education authorities can come up with an overall plan to add the experience of Daoci, then the efficiency of the second time will definitely be greater.</p>

<p>[Special Telegram from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th] At the moment, there are no fierce battles in each theater of war, but local contacts are more intense. A certain military expert infers that the second major decisive battle of the war of resistance against Japan is difficult to launch in the short term. Japan seems to have learned from the mistakes of rapid advances and has a tendency to change its battle plan.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi Border Defense is Safe</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th] According to reports, Japan is still actively deployed in the Guangdong border, and it seems that it is preparing to launch a general offensive against us by sea, land, and air. We have been closely guarded, and the Guangdong-Guangxi border defense is safe.</p>
<p>[Foreign News from This Port, 29th] According to an unverified message from Guangzhou Bay, Japanese naval marines landed in Anpu on the Leizhou Peninsula yesterday (at the mouth of the Jiuzhou River, more than seventy miles from Lianzhou County). Heavy artillery and explosions can be heard in the Guangzhou Bay area.</p>
<p>[Jiangxi Rapid News from the Awakening Society] After the Jiangxi Japanese army has successively increased its reinforcements, it has recently shown signs of making trouble. In addition to constantly sending Japanese soldiers to harass everywhere and try to attack our army's positions to test our strength, they also forcibly pull the people of our regions to build fortifications and collect bamboo and wood to form rafts in preparation for crossing the river to attack. However, the defenses of various counties in Jiangxi have long been arranged properly, and the strength is exceptionally strong. Now, the local teams in various places have received orders from General Xia Wei, the commander-in-chief of the western route, to launch extensive annihilation of the Japanese guerrilla war in various ways to assist the main force in the counter-offensive.</p>
<p>We Control the Battle Situation in Western Shanxi</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from This Newspaper, Xi'an, 29th] The Japanese army in western Shanxi has repeatedly attacked unsuccessfully. Although both sides have suffered considerable casualties, we have maintained control of the battle situation. The main guerrilla forces are also important, and they use a free form. At the moment, there are many small battles along the Zhongtiao Mountain to the Tongpu line, and there are constant artillery battles along the river. Our infantry and artillery are deployed on the river defense, and the positions are solid.</p>
<p>[Reuters Telegram, Chongqing, 29th] According to a Chinese report, there are still fierce battles in southern Shanxi. The Japanese army in Jixian, west of Linfen, rushed westward to the Yellow River two weeks ago. The Chinese army on the east bank of the Yellow River gathered in Yichuan in Shaanxi Province. The ice floes in the river have all been blown up. The report also said that the Japanese army would attempt to cross the river, but was repelled by the Chinese army with machine guns from across the bank. Another regiment of the Chinese army surrounded its back. As a result of the siege, the Chinese army recovered Jixian and Xiangning.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Emergency Amidst the Sounds of the North Sea: Guilin Province Thoroughly Destroys Highways; Military Commander Wei Yunsong Discusses the Coastal Situation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Gangming</p>
<p>[Guilin Correspondence] The new offensive direction of the enemy is mainly towards the northwest and southwest, in order to cut off our country's external routes. In the southwest, the first to be threatened is of course the line from Beihai to Nanning. Recently, the enemy has concentrated a large force in Beihai and occupied Weizhou Island. This is a prelude to the enemy's landing in Beihai and attacking our southwest. If the enemy attacks the southwest, they will inevitably attack Guangxi and occupy Nanning. Therefore, in the urgent mobilization to stop the enemy's advance and defend Greater Guangxi, the defense arrangements for Guangxi and the southern routes are a very important military matter at present. Recently, Xia Wei, the Chief of Staff of the Fifth Route Army, went to the Beihai area to inspect the defenses, and recently Wei Yunsong, the military commander who had just been transferred back to Guangxi from the front line, went to the Wuzhou and Rongxian areas to inspect, and thoroughly destroyed the highway lines in this area, in order to prevent the enemy's mechanized units from advancing during the attack.</p>
<p>There are now several highways planned for destruction, all of which could be used by the enemy when they attack Guangxi. The destruction was originally not very thorough, but after Military Commander Wei's inspection, he telegraphed to various militia districts and counties to carry out thorough destruction. The highways in the fields will be dug up and turned into paddy fields, and the highways in the mountains will be completely cut off and leveled. Currently, the masses responsible for destroying the highways are paid four jiao per day for food by the government.</p>
<p>In a very ordinary farmhouse, which is the military headquarters of a certain army, I saw General Wei Yunsong. He is a middle-aged man in his late forties, quite tall, with a large frame, and a brown-yellow complexion. General Wei still retains a pure and honest peasant temperament. People all call him an ordinary citizen, which is a well-deserved title.</p>
<p>He said, "Others always think that highways should only be destroyed when necessary. In my opinion, that's not right. Because once the highways are destroyed, the enemy will know not to come. The enemy's strength lies in the superiority of their weapons, such as tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery, and heavy weapons. Once the highways are destroyed, the enemy's heavy weapons will not be able to come easily. Without the support of heavy weapons, the enemy will not come. Even if they do come, they will have to repair the roads. For example, from Rongxu to Rongxian, this 300-li road can be reached in a few hours by highway, but after the destruction, it will take nine months to repair. Even if the enemy's engineers are skilled, it will still take five months to repair. So, in terms of seizing time to achieve seizing space, we can achieve the goal of consuming the enemy and achieving a protracted war. But some people say that highways should only be destroyed when necessary. If we destroy them in advance, we won't be able to use them to transport supplies. Regarding this argument, we need to ask whether it is possible for us to use cars to transport troops now, whether we have gasoline after we have cars. We are now fighting the enemy, and we are familiar with the terrain in our own territory. We know which points are easy to defend, and we can transport ammunition there in advance and deploy it well. Although highways can quickly transport troops during wartime, after the destruction, we can transport the wounded several li to the sides, which can also achieve the purpose of speed. Therefore, if the highways are left until necessary to destroy, we will use them less, and the enemy will use them more. Although we have no highways during wartime, we have civilian transportation, while the enemy has no coolies and relies entirely on vehicles for transportation. After the roads are destroyed, they will have no way to transport supplies.</p>
<p>In addition, some people only destroy some bridges when destroying highways, and consider it done. That is not acceptable. Based on the experience of fighting for the past year, the enemy's engineers are skilled and have plenty of materials. They can use rubber boats and rubber piles to build bridges quickly and allow their mechanized units to cross. Because of the above situation, some troops on the front line often suffer losses, thinking that the bridges on the transportation lines have been destroyed and they can retreat slowly, but as a result, the enemy quickly repairs the transportation lines and catches up with mechanized units, so they often suffer losses from the enemy. Therefore, it is difficult to say that highways should be left until necessary to destroy, Guangxi civilians are more organized and can destroy them when necessary, but at that time the enemy planes come to bomb and the civilians flee, so how easy is it to destroy them when necessary?</p>
<p>Now that the highways are destroyed, even if the enemy comes, they will have to walk. At the same time, their heavy weapons and mechanized units cannot come. Only infantry can come. For infantry to come is for the enemy to use their weakness. When the roads are good, the enemy can use their mechanized strengths. If the enemy infantry comes, we are familiar with the terrain and can use our strengths, using guerrilla warfare to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>As for destroying transportation lines, we must thoroughly destroy the roadbed and dig the mud into paddy fields, but the bridges can still be preserved. Only dig the mud, because mud on the transportation line is a matter of labor, and building bridges is a matter of technology. The enemy has abundant technology and materials for building bridges and can do it easily, but mud is a matter of labor. They have to carry it one load at a time, and the enemy will not carry mud. Our civilians will not carry mud for the enemy. Even if the enemy can carry mud, the loose mud will still not be able to carry heavy weapons and mechanized equipment, and they will be trapped in the mud. Therefore, if the enemy comes, they will have to repair the roads, which will take a long time, and we can strive for a protracted war. This is the experience we have gained from fighting for fourteen months. I already had this suggestion when fighting in Shanghai. The best example is that after the destruction of the highways in Zhejiang, the enemy is currently having great difficulty advancing. The railway from Jiujiang to Nanchang was completely destroyed, and the enemy's invasion is also extremely difficult. This does not mean that the enemy does not want to capture Zhejiang, but that it is not easy for them to advance, which can strive for a protracted war, allowing civilians to live and work in peace, produce, and increase new strength and new troops. Therefore, thoroughly destroying the transportation in the near war zone is not only to prevent the enemy from invading, but is also closely related to the entire protracted war and comprehensive war, and is closely coordinated with guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare. Consuming the enemy through a protracted war, increasing the enemy's economic panic and difficulties, and at the same time striving for changes in favorable international conditions, so that we can cultivate new combat power through self-reliance and prepare our new counter-offensive power."</p>
<p>He spoke very thoroughly and clearly. The reporter then asked how he estimated the current tense situation in Beihai and the enemy's invasion of Guangxi. He replied to the reporter in a leisurely and沉稳 manner, "If the enemy invades Guangxi, there are four routes: one from Beihai to Nanning, one from Chikan (Guangzhou Bay) to Yulin, one from Sanshui in the West River to Wuzhou, and one from Guangning and Huaiji to Hexian. But after the enemy troops attacked Sanshui and blocked the exit from Fuzhou, Wuzhou is equivalent to a dead city. After the highways from Yulin to Guangzhou Bay and from Guangning to He were destroyed, the enemy will not come. Now, only the Yongqin Line, the road from Beihai to Nanning, is left, perhaps the enemy is trying to cut off our international routes." He then added, "If the enemy occupies Weizhou Island, they will gain a land airfield, perhaps the enemy will send planes to harass and bomb Guangxi's transportation lines from time to time, just like they bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Yuehan Railway before. This is possible."</p>
<p>Then we talked about many more questions, and Military Commander Wei explained them very carefully. Finally, he politely saw me out the door. The reporter was very happy and gained a very accurate understanding of the issue. (Guilin, January 22nd)</p>

<p>[Telegraph from London, 28th] The famous French journalist Madame Tabouis made a shocking announcement, saying that Hitler will announce to the Reichstag on Tuesday that Germany supports Italy's territorial demands on France. On February 4th, Mussolini will present France with a stinging letter and claim that the British Prime Minister's visit to Italy has shattered Britain's years of illusions. Italy has decided not to negotiate small matters anymore, but wants to make a major offer first and then accept a smaller counter-offer. Italy has seen that the unity of Britain and France is very solid, and the actions taken in the next few days will affect the future of Europe. More than half of the French ministers believe that Italy, even without German aid, can attack France if it alone completes the conquest of Abyssinia. However, the French parliament believes that the power to issue orders is still in Hitler's hands. When Chamberlain went to Italy, he had no chance to express many opinions. The talks were entirely based on Mussolini's own ideas, one on French issues and one on Spanish issues. His arrogance allowed Chamberlain no room to speak. On Wednesday (the 11th of this month) and Thursday (the 12th of this month), although Mussolini did not make any territorial or other demands, it was shocking when he severely scolded France in front of Chamberlain. Mussolini viewed France as the source of European disaster, due to France's signing of the Franco-Soviet pact, France's military build-up, the prolongation of the Western War, the destruction of world commerce, and the disturbances in the Near East. France should be held responsible for all of this. Unless France's spine is broken, peace is impossible. This is Mussolini's view of France. Even if Chamberlain had the power to mediate between Italy and France, he could not fulfill it. He was shocked by Mussolini's absurd attacks, remained silent, and was as stiff as a wooden chicken, only saying that if Italy was willing to discuss legal issues with France, it should greatly reduce its fierce attacks on France. He also adopted this arrogant attitude on the Spanish issue. Chamberlain said that he did not know about the so-called Four-Power Conference. He considered the idea of mediation to be absurd and ridiculous, and that Italy's victory was only a matter of weeks. He also said that he was extremely opposed to the re-establishment of the monarchy in Spain. Mussolini also revealed that after Italy's victory in Spain and the situation changed, new British-Italian negotiations would be necessary. This is the whole truth of the British-Italian talks. Chamberlain had a bad cold while in Rome, and Mussolini showed unusual coldness towards Chamberlain in public. On the last day, Mussolini even went to the countryside to ice skate, disregarding his distinguished guest. During Chamberlain's visit to Rome, the important talks were held between the two foreign ministers, Halifax and Ciano. Foreign Minister Ciano first revealed Italy's intentions towards Spain, which the opposition parties in both Britain and France have been trying to make their governments understand for years without success. Ciano said that even after Franco's victory, Italian troops would still remain in Spain, and this was also the first time that Britain understood that Italy's demand for Tunisia was an excuse for Italy to retain its occupation of the Balearic Islands (originally Spanish in the Mediterranean) after the war. As long as the Tunisian issue is not resolved, we will not leave the Balearic Islands for a day. This is the information that Ciano revealed to Halifax. What Ciano did not say but can be confirmed by German military sources is that although Franco is making great military progress at the moment, he is still unable to completely conquer the government forces. This matter has more serious implications. At present, both Italy and Germany do not want the Western War to end immediately. This is waiting for orders from Berlin and Rome. Once the entire territory of Spain is conquered, they will attack France. Currently, there are 30,000 Germans and Italians in the West, preparing to attack France. Hitler was very satisfied with Mussolini's attitude towards Chamberlain. Hitler also expressed his willingness to aid Mussolini with force in order to force Britain and France to concede to colonial demands.</p>
<h3 id="e7">After the Bombing of Jiangmen: Some Citizens Evacuate, Business Slightly Declines <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Jiangmen Express News from the Awakening Society] Jiangmen City, Xinhui, suffered a frenzied bombing by enemy planes on the 27th, destroying houses and killing and wounding many people (the disaster has been reported in the newspaper). After the tragic incident occurred, the people in the city moved out one after another and returned to nearby villages to live. On the day the enemy planes dropped bombs, they all fell on the riverbank, destroying many boats. There were originally more than 200 boats docked there for overnight stays. The boat owners saw that the embankment had been bombed and was desolate, and in order to avoid further frenzied bombing by enemy planes, they moved their boats to Baisa, Lile, and other river bends that night, either operating as usual or stopping receiving guests and accommodation. All ferry passengers going to various places from Jiangmen were extremely crowded. On the evening of the 27th, the Longshui ferry was extremely crowded. The Jiangmen Rongqi Zhongyuan ferry arrived early in the morning and left the Jiangmen embankment to find a safe place to dock. In the afternoon, it still operated as usual. The Mu Jiangmen Qianshan electric boat also moved to the vicinity of Baisa. The situation in the city is that, except for business being slightly depressed, most of the residents have left the city. The Hailou teahouse still operates as usual. In order to save their capital, the shop owners collect money upon delivery for both dim sum and tea. The fare for rickshaws in the city has doubled, because after the frenzied bombing, the people have become birds startled by the twang of a bow, and upon hearing an alarm, they hire rickshaws to flee to the suburbs. Yesterday (the 28th), at 8:30 a.m., the Jiangmen air defense authorities issued an alarm, and the citizens, who had just recovered from their shock, fled again. In recent days, all the residents have been eating breakfast in the early morning light and then going to nearby villages to prevent the enemy planes from coming again to wreak havoc. The state of various peddlers is as usual.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, this newspaper, 29th] The central government has now completely decided on concrete plans for resistance, nation-building, and national revitalization. All undertakings have meticulous and appropriate measures to adapt to the war of resistance. In the future, we will inevitably move forward step by step according to the established guidelines, strive for final victory, and create a nation in an independent and equal position. All military and subordinate work, party and government in the war zone, have full deployments. The future is extremely promising.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Bank of China and Bank of Communications Establish Large-Scale Textile Mill in Yunnan; Headed by Song Ziwen, Qian Xinzhi, etc.; Western Development is Progressing Steadily <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Special News from this newspaper] Since the war of resistance entered the second stage, our authorities have been actively promoting the development of the rich resources of the southwest and northwest, sparing no effort. Reclaiming wasteland and developing transportation, they especially focus on the construction of industry. On the one hand, the government allocates funds to operate, and on the other hand, it encourages the financial community and overseas Chinese to actively invest. According to news from the economic circles in Hong Kong, the authorities recently established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee, allocated 20 million yuan, and are implementing various development plans in earnest. It can be seen that the central government attaches great importance to the development of the rich resources of the west. It is estimated that the groups and individuals currently investing in national construction industries include the Huaxi Reclamation Company organized by Huang Xiufeng and others, with a capital of 5 million yuan, which is currently actively underway; the Dahua Industrial Company organized by Liu Wenhui, with a capital of 10 million yuan, specializing in the development of the rich resources of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang; and Hu Wenhu also attaches great importance to the development of Yunnan's resources, and it is said that he has decided to invest 30 million yuan to handle it. As for other banks, both official and commercial, and foreign merchants from Britain and the United States, their investment in the reclamation and construction of the west is also very active. Therefore, the west of China has now become the birthplace of the new China, full of vigor and a promising symbol of the future.</p>
<p>After the fall of Shanghai, many Chinese-owned textile mills went bankrupt. Most of the textile mills run by Chinese merchants were located in the war zone and were subsequently occupied by the enemy. At the same time, Japanese-owned textile mills in Hongkou, Caojiabo, and other places were also reviving and producing in large quantities, selling to the interior. Chinese and foreign textile mills cannot compete with them, so Central China and South China have become Japanese yarn markets. Seeing this, the financial community in our country believes that since the authorities are actively building in the southwest, they should find ways to stop this leakage and avoid using funds to subsidize the enemy. Therefore, the head offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, together with the Fudian New Bank, have decided to raise funds to establish a large-scale textile mill in Kunming, also engaged in dyeing and weaving, planning to install 25,000 spindles. Currently, a preparatory committee has been established, headed by Song Ziwen and Qian Xinzhi. In order to understand the current status of the preparations, the reporter visited Zheng Tieru, the director of the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China, yesterday and asked about everything. According to him, the organization and implementation of the textile mill are probably being handled by the Kunming branch of the Bank of China and the Kunming Fudian New Bank, and they are very active. In the near future, it should be completed.</p>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing, 29th] Mr. Hu Wenhu is now establishing a company with a capital of 50 million yuan on the border of Lingnan, which has been approved by Yunnan Provincial Chairman Long Yun.

<h3 id="e14">The Youth Dare-to-Die Corps Active in Western Shanxi …Fenxi Correspondence… <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps is a newly emerging force on the Shanxi battlefield. In the year since the war of resistance began, it has been active in every corner of the Shanxi battlefield, repeatedly striking at the frenzied attacks of the enemy bandits. Although it has only been a little over a year since its inception, in this short year, in the process of carrying out the great War of Resistance Against Japan, while striking at the enemy bandits and enriching itself, it has rapidly grown stronger and become the only formidable enemy in the eyes of the enemy bandits. When the enemy bandits besieged southern and northern Shanxi several times, it always cooperated with the regular army to fight the enemy bandits to the death. Since this spring, with the expansion of our vast guerrilla warfare, the Dare-to-Die Corps has been able to automatically attack the enemy bandits, making them feel that it is the most "棘手" and formidable enemy operating in Shanxi. Here, we will briefly describe the combat record and current situation of the ×th Column of the Dare-to-Die Corps active in the Lüliang Mountains.</p>
<p>This force, when it was born last month of last year, was only a single basic general unit. However, after a year of battles, it has developed into the current strong and massive force. This cannot but be attributed to the effectiveness of its political work.</p>
<p>Like other units, the greatest task of the Dare-to-Die Corps is to constantly strike and contain the enemy bandits, so as to gradually consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese guerrilla base area in the Lüliang Mountains surrounded by the enemy bandits. In the guerrilla warfare of the past year, starting from February 7th of this year, it began to severely strike the fierce siege of the Japanese bandits with unparalleled bravery. Relying on the Tongpu Railway along the Fen River, it was also often relentlessly destroyed by the Youth Dare-to-Die Corps with the help of the masses. In May, it also cooperated with the Battle of the Jinpu Railway, making every effort to contain and hinder the enemy bandits' reinforcements to Jinpu. In June, at the perilous peaks of the Houling Mountains, it destroyed more than forty vehicles of the enemy bandits and thoroughly destroyed the motor vehicle road. Even today, the enemy bandits have not fully recovered, and traffic is still blocked. It has besieged the enemy bandits on the railway line and in the cities, threatening their freedom of movement and all kinds of evil activities. They have not only annihilated a large number of enemy bandits and puppet troops, but also used the power of political propaganda to constantly instigate the mutiny and disintegration of the puppet troops, and raised the tide of the anti-war movement in the enemy's camp. The fact that thirty-three workers revolted at the Motou military station in Zhaocheng on December 5th is a practical achievement of their work against the enemy. The spirit of the Youth Dare-to-Die Corps' heroic fighting has been praised by people from all walks of life and friendly anti-Japanese forces, and it is especially deeply impressed in the minds of the masses. They often defeat enemy bandits with superior numbers and equipment with very few people. On November 21st, they were attacked by two thousand enemy bandits in six directions in Shipicun, Huoxian County. As a result, fifteen heroic soldiers cleverly repelled four waves of attack from one thousand enemy bandits, inflicting a shameful and miserable defeat on the attacking enemy bandits with a casualty ratio of two to forty. On November 23rd, a worker of the Dare-to-Die Corps, with eight newly joined young soldiers who had not received military training and six dilapidated rifles, attacked the enemy bandits in the eastern suburbs of Xiaoyi. Apart from our slight losses, we also seized back several pack donkeys and a very beautiful horse.</p>
<p>In the past year, the ×th Column's attacks and annihilation of the enemy bandits have not only kept the vast area of the Lüliang Mountains in our hands, but also maintained the strong establishment of our anti-Japanese national revolutionary regime, protected the lives and property of the people, and consolidated the foundation of the anti-Japanese guerrilla base area in the Lüliang Mountains. In addition, the heroic and exemplary fighting spirit of the Dare-to-Die Corps has further enhanced the anti-war mood of the masses and increased the courage of all friendly anti-Japanese forces to fight against the defeatist sentiment.</p>
<p>In addition to fighting, they also study literacy and political issues, and regularly hold problem discussion meetings and life group meetings, just like a school. In addition to these tasks, each general team organizes a political work team, which regularly performs dramas in the teams. Therefore, they can constantly see vivid dramas, lively dances, and hear majestic songs and popular drum lyrics and ditties. All the soldiers love to sing tragic songs, and the songs of national salvation spread with them to the vast villages and fields.</p>
<p>When they march to a place, they hold a military-civilian get-together and perform dramas at the same time, quickly organizing the masses separately, teaching them to sing, and providing them with war news. In these tasks of publicizing and organizing the masses, each member of the team keeps in mind and faithfully executes their "Three Major Principles and Eight Points of Attention." First of all, they can respect the interests of the masses, and will not deliberately damage even a single grass or tree of the masses. This is the only reason why the common people never hate or fear them. They have received the enthusiastic support of the broad masses. The common people everywhere give them the best houses to live in, are happy to distribute petty items to them, and ask them not to leave again.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the enemy bandits have begun to besiege the guerrilla areas. The Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps has made preparations in many ways to counter the new offensive of the enemy bandits. They are making their greatest efforts to fight against the frenzied offensive of the Japanese bandits and win victory.</p>

<h3 id="e16">British Cabinet Reorganization Completed, Seeking Peace, Striving to Expand the Military, Hoping Germany and Italy Can Also Contribute, Chamberlain's Speech <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The British Cabinet officially announced the successful reorganization last night. What is noteworthy in this reorganization is that another young cabinet member resigned. Sheffield was appointed Minister of Defense Coordination. The original Minister of the Ministry, Inskip, was transferred to Minister of the Dominions. Colonel Regis Norman Smith was appointed Minister of Agriculture. Morrison was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The original minister, Lord Winterton, was transferred to Comptroller General without salary. Under-Secretary of the Army Lord Strathcona resigned, and his vacancy was filled by the former Comptroller General. Sheffield's succession to Inskip as Minister of Defense Coordination has been under attack by the opposition and some members of the Conservative Party for a long time. It is understood that Shadfield once served as Commander of the First Fleet and Chief of Naval Staff. Inskip's transfer to Minister of the Dominions is to share the heavy responsibilities of MacDonald, because since the death of Lord Stanley in October last year, MacDonald has concurrently served as Minister of the Colonies and Minister of the Dominions. MacDonald is now exclusively Minister of the Colonies. Regis Norman Smith is a newcomer to the cabinet. His appointment as Minister of Agriculture seems very competent. He served as Chairman of the National Farmers' Association from 1936 to 1937. Since 1935, he has been a member of the House of Commons representing the Petersfield District of Hampshire. It has been rumored for a long time that Morrison resigned as Minister of Agriculture. The people of the country have demanded that he resign because they are very dissatisfied with the government's agricultural policy and believe that Morrison cannot escape his blame. Morrison succeeded Lord Winterton as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a position that is usually not included in the Cabinet. Morrison will assist Sheffield and represent Sheffield in the House of Commons. When Winterton previously held the position, he was included in the Cabinet for the purpose of being responsible for air defense. His tenure in the position was considered a failure and has been taken over by Lord Anderson, the Lord Privy Seal. What is most noteworthy in this cabinet reorganization is the resignation of Under-Secretary of the Army Strathcona. He is one of the young cabinet members. In the past few months, he opposed the Secretary of War and publicly criticized the Secretary of War for the chaos of air defense and that the Secretary of War should be held responsible. Those who criticized Bailey with him also included Lord Chatfield and Under-Secretary of the Colonial Department, Yawa, and Overseas Trade Minister Hudson.</p>
<p>Chamberlain's Speech</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech at the banquet of the "Jewellers' Association" in Birmingham today, saying, "If the Anglo-Italian relations are not improved, then I will never be able to obtain Mussolini's cooperation in September last year. If Mo had not cooperated, I would not have believed that peace could be preserved. The problem in Europe last year almost caused the world to encounter the most tragic disaster. I took personal action to seek a reconciliation of the problem. Those who are willing to attack the Munich Agreement and my actions at that time are really numerous. The sources of criticism are different, but all critics have one thing in common, that is, none of them have shouldered the responsibilities like me, and none of them fully understands the situation at that time, because this kind of inside story is only known to the government. Therefore, when I look back on the past, I don't feel any regret, and I haven't found any reason to prove that other better policies should have been adopted at that time. Modern warfare is so cruel to the belligerent countries, and the losses suffered by the countries that are temporarily watching from the sidelines are so great, so we must not let the war start, unless all the glorious steps that can prevent the war have been exhausted, and they still do not work. The British government has held this view from the beginning, and our policy of peace has not been shaken so far. The so-called Munich Agreement is just an occasional fact when implementing this policy. Moreover, I have to say that the reason why European peace was fortunately preserved in September last year was because I exchanged letters with Mussolini in the summer of 1937, and in February 1938, the Anglo-Italian Agreement was established. If the relations between Britain and Italy had not been improved earlier, then I would never have been able to obtain Mo's cooperation in September last year. Without Mo's determination, I want to use all means to prevent the people of Britain and Italy from achieving their heartfelt desire. This desire refers to the spirit of friendship and peaceful coexistence between the two sides. Even if there are different opinions, they should be resolved through negotiations instead of resorting to force. This is not only the case for Britain and Italy, but also for France and Germany. We should cultivate friendship between countries. Not only official representatives can work hard in this regard, but also individuals or businessmen can work together. We are willing to tell people of all countries that we do not regard them as imaginary enemies. On the contrary, we believe that they are members of the human race, so we are always prepared to negotiate with them on equal terms, and we are willing to listen to their opinions with an open mind. If they have any reasonable desires that are contrary to the right of freedom and justice required by people and others, we are also willing to satisfy them as much as possible. There are some external toxins in the international air. If we want to clarify them and restore psychological security and trust, we will not succeed without following the above-mentioned policies. To achieve any international undertaking, this kind of security and trust is its "blood for maintaining life." We should not forget that the establishment of peace requires at least two people, but the outbreak of war is enough for one person. If we cannot obtain some clear understanding between countries and eliminate all political tensions, we cannot but prepare to defend ourselves against foreign aggression. The object of this aggression can be our land, or our compatriots, or even our freedom. We believe that the existence of democratic politics is closely related to the principle of freedom, and we feel that the highest meaning of life is also nurtured in freedom. Therefore, although we have obtained the unanimous support of the national public opinion and worked hard to expand the military, the purpose is to defend ourselves, not to invade. The time spent expanding the military in the past has been a lot, but up to now, it has accelerated, and it is proceeding simultaneously in all directions." At this point, Zhang gave a detailed explanation of the progress of the navy, army and air force in the fiscal year up to the end of March this year. Sixty new warships of various types with a total tonnage of 130,000 tons will be incorporated into the navy. In the following twelve months, about seventy-five new warships of various types can be launched. The expansion of the air force is also equally rapid. In recent months, the rate of aircraft manufacturing has doubled, and the recruitment of air force personnel has also been good. In September last year, air defense facilities were obviously lacking, but now they have been remedied and greatly improved. This does not only refer to the increase in the number of anti-aircraft guns, but also refers to the internal organization. Zhang then elaborated on the "National Civilian Volunteer Service," saying, "If we are involved in the war, we will find that even if we are not on the front line, we can be reached by enemy artillery fire. Now, in order to prevent this danger, the people of the country have a new opportunity to work hard for national defense. We just don't want to build a huge national defense force and incorporate it into a team similar to the wartime 'professional army'. We are only making certain positions responsible for the ancestors, and we are not getting jobs for all the people. We have to prepare for war and sacrifice so much time and national efforts. It is regrettable. I feel that other countries are willing to work hard for peace. This is the time. Today, the international air is full of rumors and suspicions. It should not be allowed to exist for a long time. As President Roosevelt said in his 'New Year's Message', if someone wants to control the world by force, it is a threat to peace. If there is such a request, then Luo and I have both said that democratic countries will resolutely resist it. However, I still do not believe that any country really has the intention to challenge this, because the consequences of the war are too serious, and no country wants to be involved in it. I always believe that no matter how serious the international conflict is, it can be resolved according to the negotiation and consultation methods stipulated in the Munich Agreement, and there is no need to resort to war." Zhang also explained the civil defense plan, saying, "We ask people to volunteer their services. I don't care about the results, because the spirit of service of our people has always existed, and it has never been as strong as it is today. Our motto is 'Neither arrogant nor humble, only self-defense'. We are confident that our people will actively respond to the government's call to express their determination to make this kind of self-defense invincible in the world." Finally, Zhang also talked about his trip to Rome, saying, "We went to Rome in order to further understand the opinions of Italian politicians, so that they can also clearly understand our position. All of this has been done. Although both sides expressed their opinions frankly, they never forced others to follow their own opinions. I dare say that our friendship after leaving Fuma is deeper than when we went to Zama."</p>
<p>The United States and France Express Welcome</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] A London news reporter, in stating the Prime Minister's speech, especially pointed out that our attitude has been clarified without any doubt. Now, what remains to be seen is that others are willing to assist. This statement refers to Chamberlain's another request for a "guarantee", waiting for Hitler's speech in Congress on Monday. The Times said on Monday, "The Prime Minister has now reiterated the purpose of the Anglo-German Munich Agreement, hoping that Hitler will also remain loyal, because only in this way can the future and light of Europe be maintained." The observer said, "The Sudetenland region is obviously different from the British and French mainland. If we conceal our anxious emotions and the determination to deal with aggression today, it is a great fault."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Here, Chamberlain's speech was welcomed with unexpected surprise, believing that it contained a firm stance against international intimidation. People close to the government believe that no matter how the overall situation develops, Chamberlain will always be optimistic. However, it was not long after Zhang had read Mussolini's speech, wishing the Western rebel army victory, that Zhang had again read Mussolini, which aroused some surprise. As a result of the victory of the Fascists in Spain, the threat to Britain and France in the Mediterranean, and the oppression of France on three sides, most people hope that Zhang's optimism can be fully implemented.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech was delivered with a spirit of moderation and compromise, but at the same time, the wording was extremely firm. People here welcomed it very much, believing that it was comparable to the speech given by Prime Minister Daladi in the House of Representatives a few days ago. Chamberlain's speech expressed friendship to Italy, which is the same as Daladi's speech. At the same time, Zhang expressed his belief that France and Germany still have the possibility of holding consultations. Zhang Li said that it is necessary to expand the military and strengthen national defense to maintain peace, which is the same as Daladi's speech. In Zhang's speech, he hoped that Germany and Italy could also contribute to world peace. This level is deeply hoped here that Germany and Italy can express themselves, and when Hitler and Mussolini deliver speeches, they will respond. The democratic countries have successively issued final warnings, that is, any attempt to rule the world by violence will be resisted by all democratic countries.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Oxford University Chancellor Gordon wrote to The Times today, appealing on behalf of major Chinese universities. Gordon said, "The colleagues of Oxford University express their deep sympathy for the bombing and destruction of Chinese universities by Japanese aircraft, because most universities have been forced to move to remote inland areas and continue their traditional national education under the lack of books and equipment. We have a companion and research obligation to them, just like to the University of Leuven in Belgium after the war and to Tokyo Imperial University in 1923. The International Student Service has completed its good relief work, and the United Board for Christian Higher Education in China has also done its best for the twelve Christian universities. We now propose to cooperate with the two groups and the Chinese University Committee to do our best to lend books and equipment. This fund has now received 2,000 pounds. If each university can donate something, the number can be increased to 3,000 pounds. Cooperation can achieve good results. Oxford University is now sincerely cooperating with domestic universities and related groups."</p>
<h3 id="e18">Spanish Refugees Flood into French Territory, the French Government Has Ordered the Repatriation of Spanish Strong Men <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Genoa, 29th] The Ministry of National Defense of the Western Republican Government issued a military report last night, (1) On the Catalan Line, the government army in eastern Solsuna and Vannissa defeated the enemy army and retreated with heavy losses. Currently, the Mataro area is still in fierce fighting. (2) On the Estarimadula Line, the enemy army attacked the Monte Laobio and Saint Duvejinna districts, and was repelled. Two enemy planes were shot down. There is nothing to report on the other lines.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Pierbinan, 29th] The French government issued an order last night, "All strong men of military service age entering from Spain will be repatriated." When this order was received, several refugees had already boarded the train, preparing to go inland. The French military police had to use force to force them to return to the country. Some people strongly opposed this, saying that they would rather die than be captured by the rebel army. Only women, children, the elderly and the weak were allowed to enter last night, but the latest news said that the strong men of military service age who had entered the country were allowed to stay in France temporarily, but no one would be allowed to enter again.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The French Cabinet meeting decided that if any Spanish government army went to France and voluntarily returned to Franco's occupied area, France would allow them to return to the country. Conversely, if they would rather stay in France, they must be detained in the barracks. It is generally believed that Pope Pius and other famous people have asked Franco to be merciful and issue a declaration to all civilians who have fled into exile, asking them to return to their homeland without being retaliated against. At the same time, thousands of Spanish refugees (most of whom are women and children) are now gathered on the border between La Jonquila and Le Panchees six miles away, while two government forces, each with 6,000 people, are collapsing towards the French border town of Platt Ro. There are also more than a thousand refugees (including 200 armed militiamen) who crossed the Le Panche border and are now being transported by train to the French interior. The French authorities have added regular troops and foreign volunteer soldiers to increase the strength of the border defense forces, but the influx of refugees is not being prevented.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Pan Binan, 29th] Spanish refugees are fleeing to the French border. The military authorities have taken steps to maintain law and order. The railway authorities are preparing to transport 4,000 refugees. Hundreds of other refugees are spending the night in the Serri (Spanish end of the international tunnel) to avoid the cold, and then entering France along a small road.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Last night, there were several small-scale demonstrations demanding the opening of the borders between France and the two countries. A large number of guards have been gathered and stationed at key points in the city. As a result of the demonstration, 500 people have been arrested, and some of them will be charged with insulting police and carrying weapons.</p>

After Renault reported on the new situation of France's prosperity, he continued, "The recovery has now been completed. Thanks to your devotion to public service and law-abiding, France's face in the world has been completely changed. What we can say is that although France does not despise any country, it does not fear any country. If the people of France remain calm and understand how firm we are, I can guarantee that some countries will definitely understand that it is better to do something better than to engage in war. The recovered France can resist any country today, but the future France is willing to cooperate with every country."</p>

<h3 id="e24">British Cabinet Partial Reshuffle and British and French Military Build-up <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 28th, the British cabinet is undergoing a partial reshuffle. Gadfield succeeds as Minister of National Defense. British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech stating that Britain will seek international cooperation and actively carry out military build-up to prepare for war. According to a Paris dispatch on the same day, France, in view of the serious situation in Europe, is actively preparing to strengthen its national defense and will extend the term of military service from two years to twenty-seven months. Do these few pieces of news indicate that the British and French authorities, under the threat of the advancing Germany and Italy, are beginning to realize the necessity of preparing for a counterattack?</p>
<p>At a time when the three fascist aggressors of Germany, Italy, and Japan are madly advancing a new imperialist war, the peaceful democratic countries, especially Britain and France, can only guarantee their own security and their inherent position in the world by uniting with countries such as the Soviet Union and the United States to sanction fascist aggressor countries with strength. This is self-evident. However, the power of the British and French governments is not in the hands of the people of Britain and France or the progressive parties representing the people, but is controlled by a few financial capitalist leaders and their agents. These people, despite their fine words, for the country, for the people, and for peace, are actually cooperating with fascist aggression ××, using the expansion of war to develop wealth. What they oppose most is the masses of the people gaining power. What they hate most is the precedent of the Soviet Union's liberation for the oppressed masses of the world. They are most unwilling to unite the peaceful democratic countries to overthrow the fascist aggression ×× and the vast people's free and happy world after that. They fear that there will be no possibility of monopolizing profits at that time. Therefore, they oppose democracy and progress in every possible way and want to promote fascist aggression.</p>
<p>Is the current British cabinet reshuffle a reshuffle of the ruling class? Is the military build-up in Britain and France out of determination to sanction fascist aggressors? Of course, it is highly doubtful. At most, it is only because the people of the two countries have already made this request and have coalesced into an action, so they have to "take this measure." We are not saying that Britain and France have no possibility of adopting this policy now, and we believe that the domestic and foreign situations in Britain and France are forcing them to adopt a progressive policy of defending democracy and peace with strength. However, we cannot just look at the so-called partial reshuffle and the so-called declaration of preparedness for war, but we must pay attention to their actual actions to sanction fascist aggression, and we must organize the broad masses of the people to promote their implementation of this step.</p>
<h3 id="e25">× Occupation of the Xisha Islands Plan <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Reuters in London reported on the 28th that the Japanese authorities are planning to invade and occupy the Xisha Islands. This news can be viewed in connection with the occupation of Barcelona by the Italian expeditionary force. The reason why the Italian aggressors were victorious in Spain, and will even join forces with German fascists to further invade France itself, is entirely the inevitable result of France's following a policy of appeasement and making concessions to aggressors and bribing small and weak countries. This policy of retreat and bribery in Europe has indeed encouraged the aggressors, and at the same time, it cannot stop the covetousness of the Eastern aggressors—now Japan's plan to attack southward is gradually approaching, and its target is no longer limited to Wuzhou and Nanning, but also includes the entire territory from Tokyo Bay, the Indian Ocean to Southeast Asia—the occupation of the Xisha Islands is just a small hint of the advance. It can be seen that in order to effectively protect the Far East rights and interests of France and even Britain, the policy of retreat and bribery to aggressors must first be abandoned.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Sky Peace Front <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>In this war-torn world, there have also been many gratifying news items in the past few days. Among them, what is particularly noteworthy is that, according to a Chongqing dispatch on the 27th, the Sino-British joint aviation transport will fly from London to Chongqing within the next five days, and will then fly according to the prescribed schedule, making transportation between Britain and Chongqing more convenient. As for the line between China and Myanmar, it will also be completed soon. At the same time, according to government sources, the Chinese and Soviet authorities will also organize a line from Moscow to Chongqing to facilitate Northwest transportation. If night flights can be used, it will be possible to reach Moscow directly from Chongqing within 40 hours. In addition, US President Roosevelt announced on the 27th that US aircraft manufacturers have obtained government approval to supply France with an unlimited number of aircraft. What is the significance of this news? First, we can see that the contact between the several peace-loving countries of China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France has become closer under the threat of the evil demons of Eastern and Western aggression. Second, because air transportation will have a decisive influence on the outcome of the war in the future, the development of general air communication by these peace-loving countries may still be the prelude to the Sky Peace Front. We hope to further consolidate and expand the global anti-fascist and anti-aggression front through the completion of the Sky Peace Chen Line.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Comparison of US Munitions Supplies to China and Japan in the Past Year <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Author VIGINA THOMPSON</p>
<p>Translated by Bao Ren from the December 27th issue of the New York FAR EASTERN SURVEY weekly</p>
<p>According to the latest bulletin from the US Bureau of Foreign Trade, the value of US munitions exports to the Far East decreased significantly in 1938. In China, because the coastal provinces were occupied by the Japanese army and important transportation routes were cut off, munitions could not be transported. In Japan, because US President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull advised munitions dealers and aircraft factories not to sell munitions and aircraft to Japan, the munitions trade between Japan and the US also gradually decreased during the year.</p>
<p>The amount of US imports of military supplies to China (excluding firearms and ammunition) fluctuated during the year, showing an irregular phenomenon. It reached US$2,500,000 in the first month, US$2,000,000 in the second month, and dropped to US$150,000 in the third month. However, in April, it suddenly increased to US$2,527,161, breaking the previous record. In May, it decreased to US$523,298, and in June it increased slightly, worth US$1,236,020. In July, it was only worth US$164,698, and in August it was worth US$122,448. It increased slightly in September and October, totaling US$706,135. In November, it decreased to US$1,949.</p>
<p>As for the practical military equipment (shells, aircraft, etc.) supplied by the US to China, the situation was even worse. In June 1938, it was worth US$2,212,000, in July it was worth US$937,000, in August it was worth US$299,000, in September it was worth US$99,000, and in October it even decreased to US$49,000. The Chinese government used most of the above amounts to purchase aircraft.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, undoubtedly, Japan's disregard for international credibility, violation of peace treaties, and contempt for US rights and interests in China have aroused a deeply rooted anti-Japanese concept in the US government and people. Most of the domestic munitions dealers have automatically adopted a passive and uncooperative attitude towards Japan. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull repeatedly stated in July this year that he would dissuade the interruption of munitions supplies to aggressors. The domestic authorities called for the promotion of international peace through economic welfare, and the atmosphere of breaking off relations with Japan became increasingly turbulent. From January to June 1938, the US averaged more than US$1 million per month, with some months reaching as much as US$2 million. However, in July, due to the response to Hull's promotion of sanctions against Japan, munitions shipments to Japan decreased significantly. Taking military raw materials as an example, they were worth US$1,125,493 in July, but decreased to US$179,249 in August. The decrease was even greater in September and October, with September worth US$85,138 and October worth only US$78,720. After October, the military supplies shipped by the US to Japan were all goods that Japan had pre-ordered from US merchants before July. If we wait until the contract expires, the amount of military supplies imported by the US to Japan will naturally decrease.</p>
<p>As for the practical munitions (firearms, ammunition, and aircraft) supplied by the US to Japan, there was a significant reduction. In February 1938, the average monthly value was US$1,250,000 from July to August, but decreased to US$679,000 in September, and decreased to US$368,000 in October. The biggest reduction was in aircraft.</p>
<p>From the above trade figures, we can draw a conclusion that the US's non-cooperation and ban on the export of munitions to Japan have been quite effective. According to the State Department's report, from January to October, although the main transportation routes were cut off by the Japanese and transportation was difficult, the total amount of practical munitions supplied by the US to China was still worth US$7,760,360. In Japan, although it occupied the main coastal transportation routes in China and there was no obstruction to transportation between the US and Japan, the total amount was only US$9,019,458, which was only slightly different from that of China. If China continues its long-term resistance, the munitions trade between Japan and the US will inevitably plummet and become a downward trend.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Bloodshed Occurs in Wanchai Hennessy Road Tea House Late at Night; Man Seriously Injured with Axe; Hit with Bottle Then Chopped with Knife, Life in Danger; Assailant's Nerves Stimulated by Tragic Experience <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>At 0:30 AM yesterday morning, a case of a middle-aged man being seriously injured in the Tea Fragrance Room at 81 Hennessy Road, Wanchai occurred. After the incident, the assailant went to the Police Station to surrender himself. The following is a record of the investigation.</p>
<p>Man Attacked in Tea Fragrance Room</p>
<p>The location where this late-night bloodshed occurred was in the Tea Fragrance Room Restaurant on the ground floor of 81 Hennessy Road, Wanchai. The restaurant has booths and loft seating. The incident occurred in the first booth on the right. Before this bloodshed took place (around 0:00 AM yesterday morning), a middle-aged man in a black suit brought a modern woman to the restaurant for a meal, sitting in the first booth on the right and ordering food. At 0:30 AM, a waiter named Li Bing (20+ years old) suddenly lost control for unknown reasons. He took off the dart he was wearing on his hand, held a soda bottle, and rushed forward, hitting the man on the head. The man was caught off guard and was hit squarely, causing the bottle to shatter and blood to flow like a fountain. He fell to the ground, and the soda bottle also shattered, injuring the assailant's hand with shards of glass.</p>
<p>Soda Bottle and Cleaver Used as Weapons</p>
<p>After the assailant stunned the man with the soda bottle, he took a cleaver and hacked at the injured man indiscriminately. He was struck twice on the head, once on the top of the head, and once on the left arm. Each wound was deep enough to see bone. After receiving these several blows, the injured man's injuries became more serious, and fresh blood flowed out of the wounds, as if he were bathing in a pool of blood. At this time, other tea drinkers in the room, seeing the bloodshed, left the store one after another. However, the assailant remained calm after the attack, his face unchanged, and he did not flee, but instead sounded the police whistle to alert the police.</p>
<p>Police Not Called, Surrenders Himself</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after whistling for a long time, no police officers arrived. The assailant went to Police Station No. 1 to surrender himself. The on-duty officer in charge of the station, upon hearing the report, considered the case to be serious and immediately dispatched a large team of Western detectives to investigate the scene and photographed the location of the bloodshed for government records. They also found a cleaver and fragments of a soda bottle in the store, which were taken back to the police station as evidence for future trials. At the same time, they telegraphed the Fire Department to send ten vehicles to the scene to send the injured man to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, although the on-duty doctor tried his best to treat him, he remained unconscious. Because of excessive blood loss, it is necessary to see if the injury can pass the danger before determining whether his life is safe or not. As for the eyewitnesses at the scene, the partners of the restaurant, and the woman who came to the restaurant with the injured man, they were all summoned to the police station by detectives to inquire about the situation and file it for record.</p>
<p>Family Scattered, People Dead, Nerves Stimulated</p>
<p>It is found that the assailant's name is Li Bing, and he is only 20+ years old. He was hired as a waiter when the Tea Fragrance Room opened a few months ago. Li's family has always lived in Guangzhou. Recently, he received a letter from his family stating that the family was unfortunate and suffered misfortune due to the national crisis. His parents and brothers died tragically. Li Bing was extremely sad when he received the news, and his nerves were suddenly severely stimulated, so he had this violent outburst. As for the Tea Fragrance Room, due to the unfortunate bloodshed that occurred in the store yesterday morning, the store was unable to continue its business operations yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Fishermen's Progressive Association received a report from fishermen again that Shau Kei Wan trawler fishing boat No. 2545W, owned by Zhong Xihuan, went out to sea for fishing in mid-month. The day before yesterday (28th) at 2:00 PM, when it sailed to the sea area at the junction of Chuk Yue and Chuk Chau, it saw a × soldier speedboat approaching head-on. It was about to raise its sails to escape, but was eventually caught up and ordered to stop for inspection. Then several × soldiers jumped down the boat with guns and ordered them to raise their sails and sail to a nearby island. Then they lowered the sampans on the boat into the sea and took the 23 people, including the old, the young, women, and children, onto the sampans. They looted everything they had and gave them two sheets of cartoon pamphlets with lies. Then they poured water on the boat and set it on fire, leaving no trace. In total, they lost five to six thousand yuan. The 20+ of them gathered on the sampan, leaving it to capsize. Yesterday morning, they encountered a Cheung Chau ferry, waved and shouted for help, begging them to tow them back to Hong Kong. However, the ferry refused to accept them. After repeated pleas, they only agreed to take a fisherman named Shi Wenyou back to Hong Kong to report to the Fishermen's Association and request a ship to be sent to tow them back from the disaster site. Therefore, the remaining 22 people are still stranded overseas.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Overseas Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce Proceeds with Reclamation to Aid Refugees; Allocates 15,000 Yuan to Reclaim Danshui Jilong Mountain; Establishes Reclamation Committee to Be Fully Responsible for Everything <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>When × troops invaded Guangdong, Huiyang suffered the most damage because of its strategic location. Now that the × troops have withdrawn, the refugees after the disaster are everywhere. They have no homes to return to and no clothes or food. The disaster situation is tragic. The Overseas Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce has been actively handling accounting and relief work in recent months. Recently, it has been proposed that it is not a long-term solution for refugees to sit and eat all day, so reclamation will be carried out in suitable locations in the mainland to implement fundamental relief measures. The budget is to allocate 15,000 yuan first, and the location will be selected as Danshui Jilong Mountain. The plan is roughly divided into the following points:</p>
<p>Establish a Reclamation Committee</p>
<p>1. Motivation: According to past aid to refugees, it is a stopgap measure. Using refugees for reclamation can make the most of their efforts and make the most of the land, which is a fundamental relief measure. 2. Establishment of the Reclamation Committee: The motivation was launched on the 16th of this month. The Reclamation Committee was established and Xu Rangcheng and others were elected as members to plan everything. On the 22nd, two staff members, Yan Kezhen and Ye Renchun, were selected to go to the Jilong Mountain area to investigate soil quality, water conservancy, and local conditions. 3. Investigation Results: The investigators returned to the meeting on the 27th and reported that the Jilong Mountain wasteland is vast and endless. You can choose a corner for reclamation at will, and you can get a thousand acres of area. All the wasteland belongs to low hills and ridges, with loose, thick, and fertile soil. The water source is quite large, and with manpower maintenance, there is no need to worry about water conservancy. The location is suitable between Danshui and Longgang, with convenient water and land transportation, and the location is close to the disaster area. If funds can be allocated for operation, it will be able to accommodate a large number of refugees. According to the investigators' report, the villagers of the villages near Jilong Mountain strongly agree with this move.</p>
<p>Implement Refugee Relocation</p>
<p>4. Implement the relocation of refugees for reclamation. At the relief meeting last night on the 28th, the results of the discussion were to first relocate the refugees from Shatoujiao and all the necessary items to Jilong Mountain to start reclamation in order to cultivate in the early spring. 5. Allocate reclamation fees. The relief meeting decided to temporarily allocate 15,000 yuan in military coupons for the Jilong Mountain reclamation fee. All detailed rules for handling shall be the responsibility of the Reclamation Committee. Detailed regulations shall be drafted by the Reclamation Committee and submitted to the General Assembly for approval and implementation. Personnel have now been sent to negotiate with the county government authorities on various procedures to be handled. Once they are properly identified, they can be opened.</p>

<p>At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a shooting incident occurred between Shenzhen customs officers and smugglers. As a result, a man was shot in the left hand, and two other men were detained in the police station, suspected of being smugglers. It is investigated that smugglers gathered in the Shenzhen River area at the Sino-British border in Shenzhen. If customs officers are even slightly negligent, smugglers will swarm across the border. Once they cross the border, it is very difficult to investigate and arrest them. At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, smugglers were again smuggling goods behind the You Sheng Company building, not far from the border, and crossing the Shenzhen River from the Chinese side. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by customs anti-smuggling police, who immediately stopped them. In this critical moment, the customs anti-smuggling police fired warning shots, and the smugglers also returned fire. For a time, gunshots were heard repeatedly, frightening many male and female refugees nearby. In the end, the smugglers were defeated and all were repelled. A man was hit by a bullet in the left hand and was in so much pain that he could not walk. He was carried back to the Shenzhen Police Station by the anti-smuggling officers. Two other men were also detained, all of whom were suspected of being involved in the smuggling case.</p>

<p>Recently, armed robbery cases have occurred continuously on both land and water in Hong Kong. Yesterday, three robberies occurred continuously in Shangshui Village, Tseung Kwan O, and Sham Shui Po in the New Territories. The robbers were all armed with pistols and sharp swords, and they were imposing. The robbed jewelry and cash amounted to more than two thousand yuan. The victims went to the police station to report the cases and requested investigation and arrest. The cases are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shangshui Village</p>
<p>The woman Yao Yuchan (48 years old) and her daughter-in-law Zhou Meiying (21 years old) live together in a thatched house in Shangshui Village, New Territories, without a house number. They make a living by farming and have some savings, which has caused them to be coveted by robbers. At about 3:00 AM yesterday morning, five robbers, two holding pistols and one holding a flashlight, broke in to rob them. At that time, Yao and her daughter-in-law were dreaming and were awakened by the sound of digging. Before long, the thieves had entered. First, they pointed at Yao and threatened her, then they went to the attic and threatened her daughter-in-law. Because they resisted slightly, the woman's head was slightly injured by the thieves, and she was eventually subdued and covered with a palm quilt. Then they carried out a large-scale search and robbery for about half an hour, robbing them of HK$810, 1,600 yuan in national currency, and two gold rings, and then left calmly.</p>
<p>Sham Shui Po</p>
<p>A resident of 154 Apliu Street, Sham Shui Po, Mr. A, his concubine Hu Jin (28 years old), and a maid lived together on the second floor. At about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Mr. A went out, leaving only his concubine and maid at home. Suddenly, five men knocked on the door, two of whom were carrying bamboo poles, claiming to have been hired to move furniture. Hu did not notice and opened the door to welcome them in. Unexpectedly, the other three were carrying sharp swords. After entering the door, they immediately drew their swords and pointed them at Hu and the maid, driving them to a corner, and then tied them up. Then they went straight into the room and dug open the silver box, taking all the jewelry and cash contained in it. After the thieves left, Hu untied the ropes and sounded the alarm, and then went to the police station to report the case. As for the amount of the loss, it could not be known in detail because her husband was out.</p>
<p>Tseung Kwan O</p>
<p>Wu Mei, Lu Qiao, and Lu Ning, warehouse clerks of the Southwest Petroleum Company in Tseung Kwan O, reported to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station yesterday that at about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when they were passing near Hang Hau Village, they were suddenly surrounded and intercepted by six robbers armed with sharp swords and bamboo poles. Under threat, they could not resist and were thoroughly searched, robbing them of HK$5 and leaving in separate directions. Please file the case for investigation.</p>

<p>Following the passage of the organizational charter of the Hainan Overseas Chinese Federation at the Hainan Overseas Chinese Representative Assembly yesterday, the election of the first Executive and Supervisory Committee members was conducted. After rigorous voting over the past two days, forty-one Executive Committee members and eleven Supervisory Committee members were elected. These included eleven representatives of inner Siam (Thailand), four each from Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Selangor, Johor, and Hong Kong, and three each from the Dutch East Indies and Annam (Vietnam). There was one alternate Executive Committee member from each location and three alternate Supervisory Committee members from Siam, and one each from Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Selangor, Johor, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, and Annam. After the election of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members, the Assembly was adjourned, and all matters will be handled by the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Federation. It has been decided that the first joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees will be held this afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Opening Up New Tax Revenue Sources: Heavy Tax on Heavy Oil Vehicles; Most Heavy Oil Users are Long-Distance Vehicles <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government, in order to open up new sources of tax revenue, specially appointed Financial Secretary Gim Sin-ngai, Barrister Lo Man-kam, and five others to form a tax system research committee, with the Financial Secretary as the ex officio chairman. They are responsible for studying the current general economic situation in Hong Kong and recommending appropriate new taxes to increase income. After this matter was announced, many Chinese and Western individuals in Hong Kong offered suggestions. Although the research committee has held many meetings, the measures to be taken remain confidential, and the committee members are tight-lipped. According to a report in yesterday's English-language Sunday newspaper, the Hong Kong government intends to tax vehicles equipped with diesel engines. This tax will differentiate between vehicles using gasoline and heavy oil, with the latter referring to vehicles equipped with diesel engines, which are mostly long-distance vehicles. The reason for this taxation is that gasoline is already subject to a high tax rate, while heavy oil is not. Therefore, the former has already contributed significantly in taxes. Moreover, the fuel consumption of diesel engines is much lower, so taxing heavy oil users is intended to balance the tax burden between the two types of fuel.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong government, in view of the need for accurate information on the quality of personnel for wartime service, in order to quickly recruit personnel in times of emergency, submitted the Personnel Ordinance to the Legislative Council for approval, in order to implement personnel registration. This registration is limited to British citizens, while Chinese and British-born Chinese can register voluntarily. According to a report in the Hong Kong English-language Sunday newspaper, the Hong Kong authorities have not yet decided on the date of implementation and are still considering the matter. One reason is the delay in printing the registration forms, and they are also considering exemption measures. However, the official announcement will be made soon. Once announced, all British citizens residing in Hong Kong between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five will be required to submit the completed forms within two months. There are no restrictions on the Chinese, who can register voluntarily.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Tang Sai Singing Girls Awarded for Charity Performance: Singing Girls Enthusiastically Serve the Nation, Hong Kong Anticipates Victory Songs <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<p>In our country's sacred history of resistance against Japan, the women's sector occupies a glorious page. For example, Old Madam Zhao organized a guerrilla force, and Yang Huimin presented the flag at the Four Banks Warehouse. Many female compatriots braved countless dangers and endured immense hardships to care for wounded soldiers and comfort the fighting soldiers at the front, serving the heroes of the battlefield. In the rear, they raised comfort items, medicines, sewed military uniforms, and participated in fundraising for various types of war bonds. All of these are historical materials that should be included in future war histories and should not be omitted or avoided.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, various women's organizations are still doing commendable work. Recently, the Tang Sai singing girls held their sixth charity performance to raise funds for the Chinese Youth Relief Corps, adding another praiseworthy page to the history of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Yesterday—the day after the eighth anniversary of the "January 28th Incident"—in the afternoon, on the third floor of the Shek Tong Tsui Garden Restaurant, an emotional scene unfolded. This was the grand awards ceremony for the sixth charity performance.</p>
<p>Hanging above the stage was a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, flanked by crossed Kuomintang and national flags. In the center was a table displaying a glittering crown, two tiaras, and several shiny silver tripods. On both sides of the stage were piles of colorful flower baskets, smiling brightly at the audience. In front hung a silk banner that read "Patriotic Songstresses," along with a small couplet that said, "The war of resistance has not yet succeeded, donations are still needed." The atmosphere all around was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, amidst the melodious music, this meaningful awards ceremony began under the gaze of hundreds of eyes. Ms. Bu Dezhi, wearing the uniform of the relief corps and exuding a heroic spirit, first stood on the stage.</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Zhiyi briefly explained the great significance of the singing girls' charity performance and thanked the sponsors for their generosity.</p>
<p>Ms. Kuang reported on the preparations for the charity performance, sincerely praising the enthusiasm and efforts of several women, including the chairpersons of the charity performance troupe, Bao Yu, Mei Li Li, Wan Hong Nv, and Duo Nv. Ms. Bao Yu was the founder of the charity performance, and the others were outstanding performers who shared a common belief in the cause.</p>
<p>The experienced revolutionary heroine He Xiangning delivered a poignant and moving speech. She said that in the past, Chinese women had no status, and the rise and fall of the nation was considered irrelevant to them. There was also a derogatory saying about singing girls: "Singing girls do not know the sorrow of national subjugation, still singing 'Backyard Flowers' across the river." But now, things are very different. Singing girls have awakened. They not only know the sorrow of national subjugation but also participate in the work of national salvation. Therefore, these insulting verses about singing girls should be changed immediately. Let us change them to "Singing girls enthusiastically serve the nation, Hong Kong anticipates victory songs!"</p>
<p>Amidst the prolonged applause, Ms. He expressed her earnest expectations for the ladies and gentlemen living in comfort. At the same time, she hoped that the ladies of the charity performance would continue to promote their sincere patriotic spirit, so that it would have an even greater and better impact in the war of resistance!</p>
<p>Guest Tang Jiancun, in an impassioned tone, elaborated on the significance of the singing girls' charity performance. He said that since the "July 7th Incident," Chinese daughters have made glorious achievements. The Tang Sai singing girls have held six charity performances, contributing their best efforts. This spirit is as praiseworthy as the heroic women who presented the flag at the Four Banks Warehouse. In terms of social status, they may not be comparable to the wives and daughters of officials, wealthy merchants, and magnates, but in terms of national interest, they have the glory of honor and should make those who only know how to apply makeup and live a life of drunken dreams, unaware of the rise and fall of the nation, ashamed to death!</p>
<p>Bao Yu, the representative of the charity performance troupe, spoke elegantly and humbly. She said, "The first two of the past six charity performances had the best results; the first raised more than 5,000 yuan, and the second raised more than 4,000 yuan. The following performances saw a decline. This time, thanks to the efforts of Ms. Kuang Dezhi and the inspiration of the relief corps in the work of national salvation, we suddenly recovered to more than 3,000 yuan. However, in terms of national salvation, this is still a drop in the bucket and does not help much. I hope that wealthy ladies and gentlemen will contribute more."</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Wu Chaoshu presented the awards. Mei Li Li, Wan Hong Nv, and Duo Nv were called out to the stage in turn, first crowned, and then awarded silver tripods. Mei Li Li, the "Singing Queen," wearing a snow-white fur coat, with an oval face and neatly styled hair, graciously accepted the crown of honor. Wan Hong Nv was elegant and quiet, wearing black glasses, like a well-educated student, revealing a faint smile under the gaze of the audience after wearing the "Red Star" tiara. Duo Nv was like a girl from a modest family, but wearing a sable fur coat, she maintained the demeanor of a "Singing Leader!"</p>
<h3 id="e38">Most of the Cotton Cloth and Foreign Goods Stored in Hong Kong have Been Sold; Exporters can Overcome Difficulties; Cotton Cloth Inventory is Now Only 500,000 to 600,000 Yuan; Foreign Goods are also Gradually Decreasing, and Western Merchants are No Longer Pressuring <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong's cotton cloth, textiles, foreign goods, copper, iron, electrical appliances and other export merchants previously ordered goods worth six or seven million yuan from Europe and the United States, intending to transport them to inland South China for sale. Unexpectedly, as soon as the goods arrived, the war in South China suddenly broke out, and transportation was interrupted. The ordered goods could not be transported for sale, and the foreign firms were pressing for payment and delivery on schedule. In order to avoid significant losses, the merchants jointly petitioned the Western Merchants Association and Chinese representatives, asking them to request the Hong Kong government to ask the Western merchants to postpone the delivery of goods. However, to this day, there has been no result. The reporter believes that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and if this issue is not resolved, the merchants will be even more affected. To understand the current situation, the reporter made a special investigation to relevant parties yesterday. According to a merchant, the largest inventory two months ago was cotton cloth, worth no less than three million yuan. Because sales to the interior have been completely cut off, they have sought to promote sales in new markets, such as Guangzhou Bay, Chi Kan, Macau, and Gulangyu. In the past one or two months, many of these goods have been sold. At the same time, due to the increase in population in Hong Kong, retail business is better, so more than 80% of the goods worth more than three million yuan have been sold. The current inventory in the warehouse is only worth five or six hundred thousand yuan. It is expected that another 10% can be sold by the end of the lunar year, and the remaining will not be a problem. It is hoped that this difficult situation can be overcome safely. As for foreign goods, the sales in Hong Kong have not been prosperous due to the massive dumping of × goods. Fortunately, the previous inventory was only one million yuan. Currently, some of it has been transported for sale to Guangzhou Bay, Gulangyu and other places. The goods stored in Hong Kong are only worth three or four hundred thousand yuan. The foreign firms are no longer urging for delivery, so it is also hoped that this situation can be overcome safely. It was also learned that cotton cloth merchants must order goods from Europe and the United States three months in advance. Currently, a small number of stores have begun to order summer goods from foreign firms, but because of the impact of the dumping of × goods, they have not dared to order too much.</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Active Hui Bao People's Guerrilla (2) <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Rouzhi</p>
<p>The guerrilla force is the vanguard of the people's resistance to Japan and also the school of the people's resistance to Japan. In addition to several detachments and a special service team of soldiers, there is also a political work team, which is led and directed by the political department of the general team. The political work team pays special attention to political education and learning, but also receives military training. If necessary, it can also hold guns to fight. The political education of soldiers is the responsibility of the political department personnel. The work of the political work team focuses on propaganda and organization among the people. In the places where it is stationed, there are market reports published every market day, which are warmly welcomed by the masses. However, the work of the masses is not solely the responsibility of the political work team. The soldiers of each detachment also have not given up this responsibility. Whenever there are plays and songs, the members of the political work team participate, and the soldiers of each detachment also participate. In the past, they have performed several plays. Now they have decided to perform once every market day. Most of the scripts are written by themselves. Although the performance results may not be perfect, the effect is not small. The day the reporter went to the headquarters of the general team was the day they performed a play at the July 7th Memorial Platform in the market. Unfortunately, I arrived two hours late and could not see their performance, which I deeply regret. I heard them say that one of the plays performed that day was "Little Hero," which was written, directed, and starred in by a genuine little hero among the soldiers, and was very much admired by the people.</p>
<p>Because they have a deep and correct political understanding, they can consciously and actively learn knowledge and skills in all aspects of politics and military affairs. Their dinner is lively and intense. After the discussion and review, they sing songs and shout slogans, which further enhances the mood of resistance.</p>
<p>They are all outstanding children of the Chinese nation who are working hard to resist Japan. None of them do not know how to respect the interests of the people. Therefore, their adherence to discipline is completely conscious and not forced at all. Each detachment has a Sun Yat-sen room, and a blackboard newspaper is published every few days. They educate and encourage each other. Because there are many progressive intellectuals among the soldiers, writing and editing are not a problem. The people in the political department only provide guidance.</p>
<p>They also pay attention to physical exercise. Every day before dinner, someone plays basketball, and after dinner, they play various games! Most of them are interesting and meaningful. Their lives are not boring at all!</p>
<p>The most distinctive thing is: there are more than a dozen female soldiers among them. Some are political workers and paramedics, but there are also some soldiers who are both literate and martial. One of them bravely fought in Dongguan. A soldier I know told me that when practicing target shooting, this female soldier hit the bullseye with three consecutive shots. In the future, it will not be difficult to become the sharpshooter goddess described in the novel "The Forty-First"!</p>
<p>At present, the main tasks of the guerrilla force are: mobilizing the masses, eliminating traitors, preventing bandit activities, helping the government to promote wartime work, consolidating and expanding their own organization, and improving the combat effectiveness of the troops. They have a glorious and great future, which no one can deny. However, because the government's territory is broken and the income from taxes has been reduced, it cannot provide the guerrilla force with ammunition and rations. In the past, the support was entirely dependent on the seamen and overseas Chinese. Before the reporter went to the headquarters of the general team, the seamen's comfort group and the workers of the Yu Le Society had all gone to express their condolences and sent a lot of supplies. Therefore, cotton clothes and medicines are now quite sufficient. However, the future is long, and they not only need to exist, but also need to develop - even military blankets, rubber shoes, raincoats, etc. are still lacking - so assistance and support for them are still very necessary.</p>
<p>Now the war of resistance has turned to the first stage, and guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines will become the main mode of operation. Regarding this point, it seems that there are still many people who do not understand. Because they do not understand, the fact that is expressed is of course to ignore the guerrilla force. This is a very bad phenomenon. After reporting, the reporter dares to ask all the elders and brothers in the East River area and the overseas Chinese in various places to pay the most attention to this model of popular armed forces - the Hui Bao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla!</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3 id="e40">Developing Rich Resources in the Southwest and Northwest; Completing the Railway Network; Xiang-Gui Railway Open to Traffic, Cheng-Yu Railway Nearing Completion; Chuan-Dian, Dian-Mian, and Bao-Cheng Railways Actively Underway <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing Correspondent] The Chinese government believes that in order to develop the rich resources of the southwest and northwest, it is necessary to complete transportation infrastructure, especially railways, as railways are essential for large-scale freight transport. The Ministry of Transportation has decided to make every effort to complete railway construction, while also building highways to assist railways. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Existing Railways in the Northwest and Southwest</p>
<p>China's western region includes the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in the northwest, and the five provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi in the southwest. The total land area of these ten provinces is 4.92 million square kilometers, with a total population of approximately 100 million. In terms of railways, there are currently three lines. In addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which was established earlier, the completion of the other two lines has also occurred in recent years. The Tongguan-Xi'an section and the Xi'an-Baoji section of the Longhai Railway, and the Ge-Bi-Shi Railway were completed in 1936. The total length of the three lines is only about 100 kilometers. In addition, there is the North Sichuan Railway, which is only 22 kilometers long.</p>
<p>Cheng-Yu Railway Completed and Open to Traffic</p>
<p>The Cheng-Yu Railway was originally the western section of the Chuan-Han Railway. After the failure of the Chuan-Han Railway, it was shelved for as long as twenty years. In March 1936, the Ministry of Railways, in accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, first prepared to build the Cheng-Yu Railway, dividing it into eight survey teams. From Chengdu to Chongqing, the entire area is rich in Sichuan's products, with a total length of 503 kilometers. The cost is 50 million yuan. In addition to forming the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to raise a capital of 30 million yuan, a loan of 24.5 million yuan was borrowed from a French banking group. Construction started in February of the previous year. After the outbreak of the war, it was ordered to be completed ahead of schedule, and it can be opened to traffic this spring.</p>
<p>Planning to Build Chuan-Dian and Dian-Mian Railways</p>
<p>The new railways currently being actively planned are the Chuan-Dian and Dian-Mian main lines. The former runs from Xufu, Sichuan to Kunming, Yunnan, and the latter runs from Kunming to Myanmar. They are the main transportation lines connecting the Yangtze River with India and Burma. The two lines have a total length of 1,500 kilometers and are contracted by the Chuan-Dian Railway Company. The company has a capital of 20 million yuan. Shen Changren is the director of the Chuan-Dian Railway Engineering Bureau, and Fu Fujun is the director of the Dian-Mian Railway Engineering Bureau. Construction of the Chuan-Dian Railway has begun and is scheduled to be completed in two years. The funding for the Dian-Mian Railway is included in the credit loan for the construction of the Guang-Mei Railway in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Xiang-Gui Railway to be Built in Four Sections</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Railway runs from Hengyang Station on the Yue-Han Railway to Guilin, Liuzhou, Yongning, and Longzhou, to Zhennanguan on the Guangxi-Vietnam border, where it connects with a branch line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The total length of the railway is 950 kilometers and is built in four sections: Hengyang to Guilin is the first section, Guilin to Liuzhou is the second section, Liuzhou to Yongning is the third section, and Yongning to Zhennanguan is the fourth section. The Hengyang to Guilin section is 300 kilometers long and costs 36 million yuan. After one and a half years of work, it was opened to traffic on October 1 last year. The roadbed for the remaining three sections has been completed, and it is scheduled to be opened to traffic for the entire line this winter.</p>
<p>Completing the Bao-Lan and Bao-Cheng Lines</p>
<p>After the Longhai Railway reaches Baoji, there are two options: to go west to Lanzhou or south to Chengdu. The Bao-Cheng line has greater economic value and is the main link between the southwest and northwest railway systems. Therefore, it was decided to build it first. The railway is 500 kilometers long and costs 50 million yuan, which has been raised from a Belgian banking company. Since survey teams were dispatched in the autumn of 1936, construction will soon begin. As for the Bao-Lan line, it was decided to start construction after the Bao-Cheng line is completed.</p>
<p>Xiang-Qian Railway, the Zhu-Xiang Section</p>
<p>After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company planned to change to the China Railway Company, it wanted to contract the southwest railway from Changsha through Guiyang to Chongqing to the company. Although this has not been realized, the Xiang-Qian Railway Engineering Bureau was established in June 1936, and it was decided to build the Zhuzhou to Xiangxiang section first. The total length of the railway is about 1,000 kilometers, and the cost of construction and equipment is 160 million yuan. Since construction began, it is not known what progress has been made. It is said that the construction of the railway has been temporarily suspended due to the war.</p>
<p>Planning to Complete the Southwest Railway Network</p>
<p>The above seven lines have a total length of approximately 5,000 kilometers and require at least 500 million yuan. The Ministry of Transportation has decided to make every effort to first complete the five main lines of Bao-Cheng, Cheng-Yu, Chuan-Dian, Dian-Mian, and Xiang-Gui. These five main lines are 3,500 kilometers long. After their completion, the northwest and southwest can be connected into one, and there will be three international channels: one from Kunming to Yangon, one from Kunming to Haiphong, and one from Liuzhou to Haiphong. In addition, it is planned to take Guiyang as the center, build the Chuan-Qian Railway to the north to connect Chongqing with Cheng-Yu, build the Dian-Qian Railway to the west to connect Qujing with Chuan-Dian, build the Xiang-Qian Railway to the east to connect Zhuzhou with Yue-Han, and build the Gui-Qian Railway to the south to connect Liuzhou with Xiang-Gui.</p>
<p>Then Build Northwest Railways</p>
<p>Next, take Lanzhou as the center, and build the Bao-Lan section of the Longhai Railway in turn, connecting Baoji with Bao-Cheng, the Bao-Lan Railway from Lanzhou to Ningxia and then to Baotou, connecting with the Ping-Sui Railway, the Gan-Xin Railway from Lanzhou through Hami and Dihua to Tacheng, connecting with the Soviet railway, the Gan-Qing Railway from Lanzhou to Xining, and the Chuan-Gan Railway from Dashui on the Longhai Railway to Chengdu, connecting with the Bao-Cheng and Cheng-Yu railways, and extending to Kangding, thus completing the northwest railway system. The above plans will be gradually implemented step by step.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Journey to the Northwest, Continued <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Mai Qunyu</p>
<p>The Five Springs at the foot of Gaolan Mountain south of the city are a famous scenic and historical site in Lanzhou. Legend has it that the Han dynasty general Huo Qubing resisted the Xiongnu here. Because there was no water to drink, he struck the stone with a whip and obtained a spring. The spring names are divided into Juyue Spring, Momeng Spring, Biangan Spring, Ganlu Spring, and Huan Spring. The spring water gushes out from the stone and does not dry up all year round. There are shady trees and several tea rooms, which is a unique place to escape the summer heat. There are many temples next to the spring. During the Buddha's birthday, the Lanzhou market is moved here, and the quiet place becomes a lively place.</p>
<p>In terms of industry, there are two match factories, Guangming and Tongsheng, and the Huasui Tobacco Company. I have visited them. The scale of each factory is very small and the equipment is very good. The most interesting thing is the Huasui Tobacco Company. According to Mr. Zhang Xuwu, the chairman of the company, when he started the company, a certain foreign tobacco company offered him a gift of 300,000 yuan, advising him not to start the company, but he refused. After more than a year of operation, a certain cigarette company that monopolized the northwest was severely hit, and the recovery of rights was not uncommon.</p>
<p>The people are simple, hardworking, and more trustworthy than those in Guanzhong. Most of the women have bound feet, and the smell of opium fills the entire Lanzhou city. The provincial government has repeatedly issued orders to ban smoking, but those who ban it ban it themselves, and those who smoke it smoke it themselves. I have visited friends in the business world, and they all entertain guests with opium.</p>
<p>After living in Lanzhou for a long time, I am eager to travel to Qinghai. After hiring mules and horses, I decided to set off tomorrow. In the evening, a police officer came and said: "There is a group of bandits in Bapan Mountain, dozens of miles west of Lanzhou, so be sure not to set off to prevent accidents." After hearing this, I was half-doubtful, so I went to the Tibetan friends and muleteers who came from Xining. They all said that this was not the case. At the same time, I also felt strange, how did they know that I was going? If there is smoke, there must be fire. There must be a reason.</p>
<h3 id="e42">From Guilin to Yunnan —Via Longzhou and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway— <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Day One</p>
<p>Traveling from Guilin to Liuzhou by water is not direct; one must take a car along the Lihua Highway to reach Liuzhou by land, a total of 241 kilometers, taking about eight to ten hours. The fare is 11.3 yuan in national currency per person. In Liuzhou, there are six or seven hotels such as Xinliujiang Hotel, Peixin Inn, Central Hotel, and Datong Township Inn. Daily room rates range from 6 jiao to 4 yuan, and meal expenses range from 5 jiao to 6 jiao per meal. Staying in a hotel near the station is more convenient.</p>
<p>Day Two</p>
<p>Traveling from Liuzhou to Nanning, take the Yongbinqianliu Highway to Nanning, a total of 675 Chinese miles (258 kilometers), taking eight or nine hours. The fare is 11.2 yuan in national currency per person. Most meals are taken in Luxu or Datang. It is more convenient to purchase tickets in advance through the China Travel Service. However, please note that passengers must take care of their own luggage when loading and unloading at stations in Liuzhou and Nanning. The same applies to luggage that needs to be weighed and charged extra. Passengers who disembark midway to join the army must pay attention to their luggage to avoid mistakes. Hotels in Nanning include Lequn Society, Guanghua Hotel, Nanning Hotel, Zhongshan Hotel, Xijiang Inn, Yongnan Inn, Yongjiang Inn, Huilai Inn, Hua’an Hostel, and Anzhan, with prices ranging from 3 jiao to 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Day Three</p>
<p>From Nanning to Longzhou, take the long-distance bus of the Head Office of Roads (because only publicly operated commercial vehicles are currently running on this route), traveling along the Yonglong Highway, passing through places such as Wuxu, Suxu, Ruicai, Mingjiang, Ningming, and Nakan to reach Longzhou. The journey is 640 Chinese miles (249 kilometers), taking about seven or eight hours. The fare is 1.3 yuan in national currency per person. However, there are very few restaurants along the way, and those available are not very palatable. It is best to bring your own food for cleanliness. In Longzhou, there are only a few hotels, namely Zhennan, Huanan, Xinhua, and Hongan, among which Zhennan Hotel is better equipped. The hotel is located on Limin Street, with a two-story building built in a semi-Western style, which is quite elegant. The room rate is from 6 jiao to 8 jiao per person per day, and several accounts of bedding are provided without additional charges. The transcription fee ranges from 3 jiao to 5 jiao, and the dishes are ordinary. To go from Longzhou to Yunnan via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and obtain a passport, upon arrival in Longzhou, immediately go to a photo studio to take four two-inch passport photos (Guilin currency 1.5 yuan), which can be prepared on the same day. Take them to the Guangxi All-Border Anti-Smuggling Supervisory Office. Go to the gatehouse to get a resume form, fill it out, and submit it to the officer in charge of this matter in the office (office hours are from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM). Also pay a handling fee of 2 yuan in national currency. The passport can be collected in two or three days.

<p>And the Scenery Along the Line</p>
<p>Zhennanguan is the key to the southern border, leaning against the mountain and facing the sun. The Zuofen Mountain and Youfu Mountain flank it on the left and right, forming a naturally advantageous terrain. Historically, it has been said that "one man can hold the pass, and ten thousand men cannot pass." Now, an Anti-Smuggling Supervisory Office is established here for defense. Beyond the gate, which has two doors, lies the territory of French Annam. There is a highway to Dong Dang, and a national railway can reach Hanoi and Haiphong. During the Sino-French War in the late Qing Dynasty, this pass was captured by the French army. Later, famous generals such as Su Yuanchun and Feng Zicai bravely counterattacked and defeated the French army here, preserving half of the southwest. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also raised the banner of righteousness here at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, in national history, this pass has a glorious significance. Today, on the summits of Zuofu and Youfu Mountains, there are still stone-built artillery fortresses, all of which were built by Su during the border defense. When foreign powers invade and strong enemies oppress us, contemplating this place and remembering the sages, we feel the gravity of our responsibilities.</p>
<p>Six, Longshui Line: Starting from Longzhou and heading west, passing through Tangjiao and Luowei to Shuikouguan, the total distance is 33 kilometers. The road surface is also sandy and muddy. There are only three bridges and 150 culverts, all of which are permanent structures. The maximum gradient is 8%, and the minimum radius of the curve is 40 meters. A border inspection office is located at the point where the Long River enters Vietnam, forming a strategic alignment with Zhennanguan in national defense. If Shuikou is not defended, one can directly descend to Longzhou, threatening the back of Nanning. Therefore, in times of war, the importance of this pass is no less than that of Nanguan.</p>
<p>One, Wusi Line: Starting from Wuxu, 28 kilometers from Yongning (one of the stations on the Yonglong Highway), to Dasi on the border of Yaogui, the total length is 60 kilometers, passing through Mingyang, Tangbao, Nachen, Datang, Nanxiao, and Taima stations. There are twelve bridges, only one of which is temporary, and 225 culverts, all of which are permanent. The maximum gradient is 12%, and the minimum radius of the curve is 15 meters.</p>
<p>This line is a section of the provincial highway. Crossing the provincial border, one can reach Beihai via Qinzhou. The sea routes of Guangxi Province are this line and the Yushi Line. However, Guangzhou Bay is leased to France, and the management rights do not belong to us. Seeking to be able to freely start operations and serve as the sea gateway to the southwest, this is the only remaining option. Unfortunately, the pier facilities are inadequate and cannot fully perform the duties of handling cargo. Now that the crisis is imminent, the future of this line is also becoming increasingly dim.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Planning for Improvement of Tea Production and Sales This Spring (Continued) <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>—Xie Yuan</p>
<p>The tea price in tea producing areas has plummeted, which has affected the livelihood of tea farmers. Later, merchants repeatedly petitioned the Trade Association for negotiation and consultation. It was stipulated that tea leaves should be divided into two types, A and B. Type A is tea that meets the requirements for sale to the Soviet Union, which must be purchased under the control of the Trade Association. Type B is tea that does not meet the requirements for sale to the Soviet Union, and merchants may ship it to Shanghai for sale on their own after settling foreign exchange. However, the negotiations were repeatedly delayed and unresolved, resulting in a standstill in tea sales for as long as a month. The capital turnover of merchants was thus stagnated, and the losses were incalculable. Although the direct losses were substantial, the reduction in production also affected the national revenue. Fortunately, the leaders of the Trade Association, Mr. Zou Bingwen and Mr. Wu Juenong, are both renowned agricultural scientists who are familiar with the market situation and see the drawbacks. With the mediation and assistance of the Zhejiang Provincial Tea Sales Office, merchants were persuaded to sign contracts to cooperate in the purchase, which was stored in Ningbo and Wenzhou. Tea leaves were then shipped to Hong Kong in large quantities, and the Fuhua Trading Company, a tea purchase agency under the Trade Association, purchased them, so that tea production could continue. However, the Trade Association's policy on purchasing tea leaves seems to be divergent. For example, tea leaves have been transported to Hong Kong with the assistance of the Zhejiang Provincial Tea Sales Office and sold at a loss, but the Ningbo Branch of the Trade Association still directly negotiates prices with tea merchants for purchase. The prices are different, and the methods are inconsistent, leaving merchants at a loss. This is something that the Trade Association should urgently correct. Although boxed tea has been shipped to Hong Kong, raw tea has been separately evaluated. Domestic sales of tea are exempt from foreign exchange settlement, and overseas sales of tea are settled after foreign exchange settlement and designated for loading and export. However, there is still a large accumulation of raw tea in Ningbo. Raw tea is a semi-finished product, and there is a risk of mold and rot. It urgently needs to be cleared. This is also something that the Trade Association must pay attention to. Furthermore, the Trade Association's controlled tea sales and unified tea purchase are only passive controls. Positive measures such as increasing production, improving manufacturing, and expanding sales channels all need to be gradually implemented.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Last year's tea market has passed, but reviewing the past is enough to serve as a reference for the future. The Trade Association's controlled tea sales has already started. If it can properly formulate plans for increasing production, improving tea, and promoting sales channels, and implement them step by step, the revival of national tea exports can be expected. I sincerely hope for this. In the blink of an eye, spring is coming, and this year's tea market is about to begin. I believe that the Trade Association must formulate an overall policy for how to improve control and develop the tea industry at this time. I dare to offer my humble opinions for correction by the gentlemen of the Trade Association.</p>
<p>Establish a Council Committee: The most serious dispute between tea merchants and the Trade Association was the pricing of purchases. The Trade Association stipulated that the purchase price should be based on the cost of tea merchants and eliminate all the malpractices and handling fees of foreign merchants, foreign firms, and Shanghai foreign tea warehouses. On a practical level, this is good, but the raw materials of tea leaves vary in quality, and the manufacturing varies in fineness. On the surface, it may seem to be the same type of tea, but the cost differs greatly. If the Trade Association stipulates the purchase price, regardless of the differences, merchants will seek profit and take advantage, which will not benefit the tea industry. This is one. Also, if the purchase price of the Trade Association is too low, the malpractices of foreign merchants and foreign firms suppressing prices will inevitably be repeated. This is two. Many of the Trade Association's evaluators lack experience and are not familiar with market conditions, so omissions are inevitable. In order to eliminate the gap between the Trade Association and tea merchants and to smoothly implement improved control, it seems that representatives of tea merchants should be invited to jointly participate in the organization of a Council Committee. The Trade Association also had a proposal for an evaluation committee, but its scope of authority was too narrow to serve as a suggestion and guidance mechanism for the implementation of tea industry control. If the Trade Association's measures are inappropriate, merchants have no way to intervene, which is a problem for merchants. Gathering wisdom and benefiting from each other can lead to a detailed and appropriate plan in advance, and then rely on public judgment in implementation to avoid leaving a bad impression. Merchants will inevitably love the Trade Association and have no complaints. A research department should also be established under the Council Committee to investigate tea production, manufacturing methods, and international market conditions, so that it is in line with the facts and serves as the guide for control, earnestly guiding tea merchants on what to improve, and combining persuasion with rewards and punishments. The management of the tea industry can then be expected to improve.</p>
<p>Managing Tea Factories: The Trade Association's purchase price is currently based on production costs, but how to determine the cost accurately is also a problem that can be studied. Tea merchants have always relied on experience to make general estimates of cost, without accurate accounting records to rely on. It goes without saying that it cannot be used as a reliable standard. Furthermore, merchants do not pay much attention to business management, especially in tea factories located in remote mountainous areas. If the organization is not strict and corruption is difficult to prevent, this will also affect the calculation of costs. Therefore, after the Trade Association controls tea sales, it should implement management in tea factories, strictly define cost calculation methods, eliminate unnecessary waste, and promote the development of tea factory operations and consolidate its foundation. This is also a fact that cannot be ignored. Tea factory operators often change every year, and most organizations are temporary. This can reduce the sense of responsibility of those who perform the business, and it is easy to start taking advantage. There are even a few tea factories where partners do not enter into partnership agreements. After the partners contribute capital, their obligations end, and everything is the responsibility of the business operator. Although they are called partners, they are equal to sole proprietorships. Whether the capital has been paid in full is not easy for outsiders to know. If the internal situation is empty, then if it encounters a setback, it will immediately go bankrupt, defaulting on tea payments and harming tea farmers. This has happened repeatedly. The financing of tea factories is often in short supply, and the only thing that can be used for turnover is the payment from Shanghai foreign tea warehouses. After the Trade Association controls tea sales, Shanghai foreign tea warehouses can no longer act as distributors. This loan will inevitably stop being granted, and then the tea factories will have no way to obtain financing (To be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e45">Exhausted from Extensive Travel, South China's Tired Troops Suffer Defeat, Lose 1-2 to Eastern, Jeopardizing Championship Position <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report) South China, during its tour, averaged one game every two days. All players were either injured or fatigued. Upon their return, they had not recovered and had to attend the league matches. No wonder everyone's spirit was low and they were tired of playing. After all, a body of flesh and blood cannot sustain such intense exercise for long.</p>
<p>Yesterday, South China, with its exhausted troops, faced Eastern in Happy Valley. Their key defender, Li Tiansheng, was absent due to an unhealed foot injury. Mai Shaohan and Liu Qingcai were forced to play, which greatly reduced their defensive strength. Furthermore, Guo Yingqi, in the front line, has gained weight recently, and his performance is no longer as lively as before. (During the tour, Yingqi only participated in one battle, but he withdrew before halftime due to poor performance.) He missed several opportunities, and the South China fans were disheartened. Luo Douwen was also uninspired, causing delays. Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, and Deng Guangsen were still acceptable, but the connection of the entire front line was inconsistent and very scattered. The offensive was also weak, and balls that should have been intercepted were often wasted. It is no wonder that they were not enough to win.</p>
<p>Eastern, having waited in comfort, was able to win, but it was accidental, not the result of true technical achievement. In fact, South China often occupied a superior position throughout the game, but it did not turn defeat into victory, purely because the front line missed good opportunities. However, Eastern's defense was very strong and commendable.</p>
<p>In my opinion, South China's failure was due to the improper arrangement of the initial lineup. If Liang Rongzhao had been used as the center midfielder from the beginning to strengthen the midfield, the two goals in the first half might not have been lost.</p>
<p>Eastern has been promoted for three seasons, and in the past three seasons, it has been defeated by South China in every game. Only yesterday did it have the opportunity to take advantage of it, win in one fell swoop, and wipe out its past shame. It should be very happy, but thinking from the perspective of the championship, Eastern's victory is only a momentary pleasure. If the Navy can achieve great success in the future, it will be thanks to Eastern.</p>
<p>According to the tally, South China has played thirteen times, winning ten and losing three, with a total of twenty points. The Navy has played fourteen games, winning ten, drawing three, and losing one, with a total of twenty-three points. Compared to South China, it is one point ahead. From now on, South China must win every game to have a chance, otherwise the championship will not be theirs.</p>
<p>Some people were dismayed by South China's defeat yesterday, but I think South China's small defeat is fortunate. If South China had met a team other than Eastern in this game, I am afraid that the exhausted South China would have suffered a major defeat.</p>
<p>In short, Eastern's victory was a victory of opportunity, not a victory of technique. Their forwards' performance was very mediocre. Apart from Hou Chengtuo, there was nothing worth mentioning. The fact that they could not score more against this tired and disorganized South China defense is enough to show that their attacking power is not strong.</p>
<p>(Eastern Team)</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan, Miao Huaguo, Zeng Zhongyun, Luo Weiquan, Song Lingsheng, Liu Shidu, Hou Chengtuo, Xu Jingcheng, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtou</p>
<p>(South China South)</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Liang Rongzhao, Mai Shaohan, Li Guocheng, Liu Gengcai, Zheng Suxiang, Luo Douwen, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>The silver whistle blew, and the war began. The Eastern generals, eager to avenge their shame, charged into South China's gate like wolves and tigers. Four minutes later, Hou Chengtuo received the ball and nodded his head, and it went into the net. Eastern fans in the distance applauded, jumped, threw their clothes and hats, and were overjoyed. Only five minutes had passed since the start of the game.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Hou Chengtuo attacked, and South China lost another city. The South China fans were very dismayed. However, Li Zhaorong intercepted the ball and scored in one fell swoop. "Uncle Mu" was extremely happy and shouted Li Zhaorong, followed by applause.</p>
<p>Eastern took the lead, and the military's morale was greatly strengthened. Xu Jingcheng sold a flaw and took advantage of the situation. A certain fan shouted "four haos," but unfortunately the ball was shot too high, otherwise Xu would have had another income.</p>
<p>During the break, Feng Jingxiang sat on the lawn, talking about the battle situation. A child stepped forward and called "Second Uncle" and asked, "Why are you not doing well?" Second Uncle only smiled and did not answer.</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping said to others, "The two goals conceded were due to the negligence of the inner guards, not my fault."</p>
<p>Li Huitang reviewed the battle situation and also said, "The standing position of the inner guards was inappropriate." In the second half, Li Guowei retreated to the defense, and Liang Rongzhao was in the middle. After this improvement in the formation, they attacked repeatedly and attacked the gate again and again. However, Liu Xianghan performed well and averted danger.</p>
<p>Li Zhaorong dribbled the ball straight up, fierce and unusual. Liu Shizuan blocked him with one foot, and Li fell forward.</p>
<p>Eastern counterattacked, Hou Chengtuo led the ball forward, and Mai Shaohan blocked the way. The two competed in wisdom. Lao Mai was injured and fell to the ground in the rescue. Lao Hou intercepted the ball again and shot, crossing the net and missing the opportunity. Lao Hou was devastated.</p>
<p>The cowboy "Zeng Zhongyun" guarded the camp and was very talented. Luo Douwen wanted to break through the pass, and the two entangled and rolled into a ball, causing the fans to laugh.</p>
<p>In the last ten minutes, the South China generals attacked vigorously, and the front of the Eastern gate was extremely dangerous. In the chaos, Zeng Zhongyun cleared the ball with one foot, and Li Deqi received the ball and kicked it. Fortunately, he was not an inner guard but a forward.</p>
<p>Although South China surrounded and attacked, they did not achieve anything. Li Zhaorong and Guo Yingqi switched positions, but there was no gap to take advantage of. In the end, they lost 1-2. The Eastern generals were overjoyed, but Uncle Lu supported his crutches, drooping his head and looking unhappy. He also mentioned to others that the fall of Guangzhou was due to traitors.</p>

<h3 id="e46">A Melee, Police Team Outplays Scottish Army, Brutal and Uninspired Performance <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report] On the Boundary Street pitch, the Royal Scots and the Police played again. The first meeting ended 3-2 to the Scots. Yesterday's second match saw the Scots, weakened by an injury to Duncan, fall 2-1.</p>
<p>The match was uninspired. The Police were brutal, playing a tough, unpolished game. The Scots were not outdone, retaliating in kind, leading to a full-blown melee.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Scots, led by Law Sheung, took the initiative early on. Heuk Hickson scored to put the Scots up 1-0. In the second half, the Police grew increasingly aggressive. Duncan was injured and had to leave the pitch. Hou Lut and Wong Kwai took the opportunity to score two goals in a row, taking the lead. In terms of performance, the Scots were the stronger team. Had Duncan not been injured, the win would have been assured. Unfortunately they lost, but it wasn't for lack of effort. Here's a recap.</p>
<p>The First Scots took on the Police Second team, winning 7-1. Next the top teams took the field. Kerrick was out, and Johnston led the attack again. Keeler Chen lined up to defend, intercepting the ball and passing it to the front.</p>
<p>Manuell intercepted and passed to the center. Hickson kept pace, bypassing Kwong Yu and kicking the ball past the stunned Parrick. The Scots' quick goal came just three minutes into the match. The Police, taken by surprise, mounted a counterattack, but the forwards were scattered and missed several opportunities. Hou Lut tried a long shot, but Toong Wing saved it.</p>
<p>Soon, the Scots attacked again. Hickson hit the crossbar, which was saved by Norsk. Macdonald broke forward, leading to a misunderstanding with a teammate. The referee intervened, and the situation calmed down. At halftime, the Scots were up 1-0.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Police played with greater determination and aggression, putting the Scots under siege. Soon, Billiton passed the ball to the front, where a surge of Police players converged. Hou Lut surged forward, heading the ball into the net as Toong Wing was injured and had to leave the pitch. He was replaced in goal by Mathieson, weakening the defense. The Police grew even more aggressive, playing a tough, unpolished game and retaliating in kind, leading to a bloody melee. In the chaos, Wong Kwai snuck in a shot that Mathieson failed to save, resulting in a 2-1 loss.</p>

Attendees included the club's chairman and vice-chairmen Guo Xianhong, Sheng Qiuxiu, Xie Yuchuan, Ye Guanyan, Huang Guoqing, Gan Weiqiao, He Shao'an, Li Gexin, Chen Ziqing, Xu Bomei, Cai Zixun, and several dozen others. Chairman Guo Xianhong opened the meeting, after which the secretary read the meeting notice. Guo Xianhong then delivered an opening speech, and General Secretary Ye Guanyan reported on the club's affairs over the past year.</p>
<p>After the report: (1) Members were asked to review the annual financial statement for the 27th year of the Republic [1938], which showed a bank balance of $8,322.44 and a cash balance of $31.70. With no objections, Shi Jinying proposed approval, seconded by He Shao'an, and the motion passed. (2) Regarding the previous committee's proposal to allocate $7,000 as a fund to prepare for the reconstruction of the clubhouse, Treasurer Xie Yuchuan reported on the club's financial situation and explained the drafting of the regulations for the fund management committee. Guo Xianhong added that if $7,000 was allocated, he would personally cover any shortfall in expenses to fulfill the original proposal. The motion was then put to a vote, and Liang Rongchu proposed approval, seconded by Chen Ziqing, and the motion passed. (3) Regarding the nomination of honorary auditors for the next term, Sheng Xiuzhu proposed that the next committee identify and appoint them, seconded by Xu Bomei, and the motion passed. Subsequently, a vote was held to elect five members of the fund management committee, and Guo Xianhong, Li Zizhong, Sheng Zhuzhu, Xie Yuchuan, and Guo Zan were elected. Following this, a vote was held to elect the next committee members. First, Xu Bomei, Gan Weiqiao, Zhang Yuting, and eight others were nominated as ballot supervisors.

<h3 id="e49">Basketball Association Meeting Tonight <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Since the Basketball Association held its annual meeting on the 26th, regarding the revision of the articles of association, due to the rushed nature, the revisions may not be perfect.

<h3 id="e51">The Most Suitable Sport for Women <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>We cannot definitively say which sport is the most suitable for women, because we have not conducted precise statistics on the effects of various sports and games on women after a long period of experimentation. From these statistics, we can obtain a clear analysis of the impact of various physical activities. However, various physical activities not only have a great impact on young women but also on their future, such as when they become mothers, and on their children. Therefore, this statistical work is very difficult to complete.</p>
<p>Overdeveloped and hardened muscle systems are not very suitable for women. The most important aspects of their bodies are softness, smooth curves, and contours. The reason why their bodies need these elements is not entirely for "beauty." In fact, women's bodies are made differently from men's. If they engage in appropriate exercise, their muscles will never develop as much as men's. Although women also have great physical strength, what is suitable for women is a physique that is "strong but not obvious." "Strength" naturally includes great physical power.</p>
<p>In today's civilized life, we must engage in systematic and regular exercise every day to obtain true health. Although women's exercise should not be too strenuous, and the duration should not be too long, the most suitable exercise for women should also be moderately strenuous. The most suitable exercise for women is harmonious and gentle gymnastics. In these exercises, it is best to include one or two rapid and relatively strenuous movements, or those exercises that require effort to hold a posture for several seconds.</p>
<p>Exercises that can correct body posture, or gradually eliminate excess fatty tissue in the body, as well as various corrective movements, are all very suitable for women. However, once these exercises have achieved their purpose, they should be discontinued and not continued.</p>
<p>Exercises with the following characteristics are very unsuitable for women: (1) Heavy blows, impacts, falls, and significant shocks to the body upon landing due to violent jumps. (2) Physical proximity between participants during exercise. (3) Activities that require great endurance or have a significant impact on the heart, lungs, and other major organs. (4) Activities that require full exertion.</p>
<p>Therefore, soccer, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, long-distance or cross-country running, rowing, and other sports are not suitable for women. (To be continued)</p>

<p>There is actually a certain easy method for serving. Before serving, you should first walk about ten feet behind the court, and then walk back to the place where you should stand to serve. When you reach the baseline point where you should stand, you should prepare to serve. The toes of your left foot should point towards the point where you think the serve should reach, and your right foot should stand slightly horizontally behind your left foot. It is best to be a little further apart, but the principle is to be natural. The ribs and shoulders should be at a 45-degree angle. This is the method for serving on the right side. If you are serving on the left side, the toes should naturally also point towards the point the ball should reach, but the ribs and shoulders should be at a 90-degree angle.</p>
<p>If you want to correct the most common mistakes in serving, the most important thing is to toss the ball to a height that gives you enough time to prepare a good swing, so that you have time to fully swing the racket behind you. Pay more attention to the possibility that the ball will clear the net and reach the end of the service box. Secondly, when tossing the ball, it should be slightly to the right of your body and in front of you. Do not toss the ball behind your head (but it is different when hitting an outside spin). As for tossing the ball, there is also a certain foolproof method. If you feel that your body is forced to lean backwards when hitting, you should know that the ball has been tossed too far back. If your body suddenly leans to the left when hitting, you should understand that the ball has been tossed too far to the left. If you feel that your top and skirt are pulled by a hit, this proves that the ball you tossed is high enough.</p>
<p>The flat aerial volley method has gradually been adopted by most female tennis players. Our recent three male champions—Vines, Pancho Gonzales, and Budge—have all adopted this method, and I also consider this method to be more reliable, crisper, more powerful, and more accurate than the chop volley method. I have two contributions to this method: the wrist must be firmly locked when hitting. If using a forehand volley, it is best to hit the ball in front of your left foot; if using a backhand volley, you should wait for the ball to reach in front of your right foot before hitting it. When hitting, your body should be tilted towards the net. The flat aerial volley does not require preparation for hitting from behind; in reality, just push forward is sufficient. The momentum should be the same as the follow-through of forehand and backhand strokes. As for volleying low balls, the method of hitting the ball with the racket face should be no different from volleying balls at waist or shoulder height, except that when hitting groundstrokes, the racket should have a follow-through towards the top of the net to ensure the ball clears the net. If you want to hit a dead ball or a ball that flies at an angle when volleying, you must naturally use the chop method, but in my opinion, the flat volley is still more suitable when going to the net.</p>

<p>Entertainment… Love Finds Andy Hardy</p>
<p>Love Finds Andy Hardy</p>
<p>Every movie about the Hardy family can give the audience fresh interest. These types of movies are full of truth and can reasonably express a large number of interesting life experiences. The realism of the depiction almost allows the audience to personally experience everything in the movie and be moved by the family's joys and sorrows. The current movie, "Love Finds Andy Hardy," the fourth Hardy family movie, has a very profound and realistic depiction of the psychology of young men and women in love. Andy (played by Mickey Rooney) is very busy with love, navigating between three women, one whom he truly loves, one whom a friend entrusted him to take care of, and another who is a sincere and enthusiastic friend who gives him a lot of help. At the same time, the family encounters an unfortunate event. Andy's grandmother is seriously ill and her life is uncertain. His mother leaves home to take care of her. Under these circumstances, they prepare to spend a gloomy Christmas. But suddenly, the mother returns with good news, giving them a "consoling" gift, and the family spends a jubilant Christmas.</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney is particularly energetic in this movie and has achieved better results than in previous movies. Lewis Stone plays a thoughtful and sincere elder and is the most outstanding character in this movie. In addition to the original cast, a singing child star, Judy Garland, has been added. Her sincere and moving expressions and clear and melodious singing also occupy an important place in this movie.</p>
<p>Empress… Paris Honeymoon</p>
<p>Paris Honeymoon</p>
<p>The story is very simple, and all the scenes rely on the support of the actors. The performance is still light and pleasant. The cast is quite complete, but unfortunately, the arrangement of actors is not very suitable. Some of the actors failed to fully display their talents.</p>
<p>The story tells the story of a millionaire from the American West who brings his fiancée to Paris because the fiancée still has to go through divorce procedures with her ex-husband there. He first stays in a small village in the Rose Country, where he meets the local Rose Queen, who is always giving him trouble. He falls in love with the little girl he calls "Little Headache" unintentionally. At the same time, his fiancée in Paris rekindles her old love with her ex-husband. He then marries the Rose Queen.</p>
<p>The movie has several beautiful songs, sung by Bing Crosby. Shirley Ross and Edward Everett Horton don't have much to do in the movie. Akim Tamiroff, a star known for playing villains, plays a comedian here, and the results are not bad. Franciska Gaal's performance is lively and excellent.</p>
<p>Oriental… Swiss Miss</p>
<p>Swiss Miss</p>
<p>The story is very simple and tells the story of two merchants (Laurel and Hardy) who sell mousetraps. They suddenly have the whimsical idea of going to Switzerland to do business. However, not only do they not do any business, but they end up being punished by working as waiters at a hotel. The two self-righteous fools make a lot of jokes.</p>
<p>There are two European singers in this movie, especially the female one, who has a very good voice. Laurel and Hardy's performance is no different from their previous works.</p>
<p>Dahua… Everybody Sing</p>
<p>Everybody Sing</p>
<p>Starring Judy Garland. Although her voice is not as moving as Deanna Durbin's, she is also an outstanding talent among the new stars. The content of the movie is about a family of theater maniacs. In terms of performance, everything is focused on comedy and song and dance. It is also the color of general Hollywood song and dance films. In addition to singing, Judy Garland's expressions are also not bad. Allan Jones, however, is not as outstanding as in "A Day at the Races."</p>
<p>New World… The True and False Wu Zetian</p>
<p>Silent Film</p>
<p>A product that wants to use sensuality and sex appeal as its selling point. It takes a stage actress who is naturally promiscuous as the central character of the movie and uses her stage performance as Wu Zetian and her licentious private life as the material for depiction. The content is bizarre and unfounded, but it may cater to low tastes. However, it does not dare to be thorough in so-called sensual and erotic scenes, which only disappoints the 'show-off' audience and disgusts the average audience.</p>
<p>Central… Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>The audience who has seen the previous episode will always remember that at the end, Jin Yejú still had a pair stolen by Zhou Zhicheng. The sequel starts from this incident and ends when the gold is returned. The plot is not as tense and tortuous as the previous episode, and the performance is also very mediocre. However, there are still many places that can win the tears of some stupid audiences, such as Zheng Shanxiao being framed and imprisoned, and Xiao Yanfei visiting him in prison. The consistent style of the story cannot be avoided. We don't need to watch it to guess the plot of the movie. Sure enough, this ideal is not wrong. Cao Tongwen is not suitable for performing in this type of movie. The scenery and photography are still acceptable in South China, but the sound recording is a failure.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Sunset <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>——Impressions from a Wartime Journey</p>
<p>My friend Ke Yun has a wartime reportage titled "Ruin and Sunset," describing the desolate sunset scene outside Taierzhuang after the battle. The concluding paragraph reads:</p>
<p>"Returning to the city from the wheat fields, there was a dog corpse lying on the hillside. Walking a few steps, there were two more × corpses lying face up on the dirt, their upper bodies covered with yellow mud, leaving only their legs exposed, with rubber boots still on their feet. A ray of the setting sun swept over his body. This impression floated into our hearts. A soldier's poem:</p>
<p>Why are we fighting?</p>
<p>The Chinese have suffered great hardship,</p>
<p>We too have suffered disaster,</p>
<p>Oh heaven, oh heaven!</p>
<p>Who will collect our scattered bones?</p>
<p>This poem also often echoes in our ears. The mood of this poem and the mood of 'desolate sunset' are so harmonious that we felt extremely complex in that moment of inspiration. One evening, I was alone outside the north gate of Shangrao watching the sunset and was again reminded of this scene. I suddenly felt that this mood was too familiar. I suddenly realized that this is the mood of the end of the century—貫徹×(Consistent) basic mood in all the war-reporting poems and articles written by people.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I suddenly opened the Iroha poem written by the Japanese monk Kukai. The song's sentences read:</p>
<p>The crimson and purple blossoms, what is the reason for their falling?</p>
<p>Gazing upon the world, how much remains?</p>
<p>Deluded in the illusion, now surpassing it,</p>
<p>The lingering dream has awakened, neither drunk nor crazy.</p>
<p>It turns out that what permeates the Japanese national psyche is this set of end-of-century moods. As the saying goes, "The sun sets, the road ends, acting perversely." The Japanese militarists' invasion craze is just a perverse chapter played out by an end-of-century mentality.</p>
<p>Every one of the Japanese militarists is good material for Freud's mental hospital. We can deeply understand this sentence only by standing on the side of the Japanese people and removing all national prejudices. On the Japanese side, although there are self-descriptive phrases such as "Land of the Rising Sun" or "Morning Sun," the nobles and militarists who control Japan's national destiny, whether from the achievements of the system itself or from the perspective of this system, have already reached the fate of "sunset" or "end of the century."</p>
<p>The Japanese ruling class and militarists are deeply aware of what the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War will be: this war will never bring a dark fate to the Japanese people, but the Japanese ruling class and militarists will go to the museum arm in arm with the German and Russian ruling classes. This is the general explanation of the various struggling postures of the Japanese militarists.</p>
<p>When the European War first broke out, at the moment when the Tsar signed the declaration of war, he said very tragically: "The terrible test for me is decided, but I will not get any recompense in this lifetime." From the process of the European War, the people under the old Russian hell were liberated, and the fate of the Tsar's system was ended: it truly makes ×× aroused by the sunset how much panic!</p>

<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>——Presented to Professor Liang Shiqiu and his comrades</p>
<p>I also want to write some beautiful poems,</p>
<p>Praising my affectionate lover;</p>
<p>But, regrettably, she is still in the occupied area,</p>
<p>And there has been no news for more than a year.</p>
<p>I also want to write a few superb masterpieces,</p>
<p>Deeply hiding them in the famous mountains;</p>
<p>But, regrettably, two of the Five Sacred Mountains have been lost,</p>
<p>And the remaining three are also under × harassment.</p>
<p>I also want to have a sweet dream,</p>
<p>So that I can pursue everything in my dreams;</p>
<p>But, regrettably, there are already bombs exploding around me,</p>
<p>Making it impossible for you to even dream.</p>
<p>I also want to be a noble hermit,</p>
<p>From then on, living in the mountains and forests;</p>
<p>But, regrettably, the Nanyang Islands,</p>
<p>Are said to have built fortifications and stationed heavy troops.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can only beg Professor Liang,</p>
<p>Begging him to point out clearly:</p>
<p>Where is there something "unrelated to the War of Resistance"?</p>
<p>Where is there an environment that is "unrelated to the War of Resistance"?</p>
<p>Worthy of admiration is Professor Liang!</p>
<p>Please don't be stingy with your compass!</p>
<p>Now there is really only one gentleman like you!</p>
<p>(Note) Not long ago, a very lively and intense debate occurred in Chongqing's literary circles. The cause and process of the matter were roughly as follows: Liang Shiqiu, on the first day he took over the editing of the Central Daily News supplement, launched a massive attack in the "Editor's Note" on what he considered the so-called "War of Resistance clichés" and solicited manuscripts "unrelated to the War of Resistance." For a time, the writers living in Chongqing were very dissatisfied and strongly disagreed. Thus, a literary lawsuit began, lasting for a month or two before ending. In addition to Liang, those who participated in this debate, before and after, included Yao Pengzi, Shen Qiyu, Jin Mancheng, Chen Baichen, Song Zhidi... and so on. This poem (if it deserves to be called a poem) was written when the two sides were arguing fiercely. Because I am afraid that readers in other places will not understand, I have added a note as above.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Mother's Joy <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Crease</p>
<p>——Presented to my brother far away on the battlefield</p>
<p>When you are on the desolate battlefield where the moon is white and the wind is clear, remembering your mother and thinking of home, please remember this sentence: "Without national freedom, there is no mother."</p>
<p>Your mother's tears are an expression of her love, pity, and worry for you, but do not be saddened by this, because your mother's tears are the compass of happiness. If we are suppressed under the iron hooves of ×, there will be days when we want to cry but have no tears.</p>
<p>The wrinkles on your mother's face are deepening day by day, your mother's body is as thin as a reed, and your mother's cheeks are gradually drying up... If you remember these things, then you should raise your spirits, pick up your guns, fix your bayonets, kill all the × heads, and bring back a little blood for your mother to drink heartily, nourishing the reed-like mother to make her fat.</p>
<p>Now that the weather is cold, your mother always likes to bask in the sunshine of the daytime, gaining a little warmth. If the sky is cloudy day by day, then you should raise your fists and unveil the smoky cloud curtain, revealing the blue sky and white sun, illuminating the earth red.</p>
<p>Your youth, your happiness, your joy, your wisdom, your future, your light, your ambition... and everything you have! Do not lose them in your mother's tears.</p>
<p>In her spare time, your mother often talks about the story of Yue Fei. How much she admires Wu Mu's loyalty and bravery! If you want to win your mother's joy, then you should prepare your flags and drums, and under the spark of freedom, step onto the open-air stage and play the story of Yue Fei!</p>
<p>On the day when the whole nation celebrates the victory of the full-scale War of Resistance, you will come back wearing the glorious military crown of freedom. When you walk before the loving heart of your mother, who is standing on the dock looking forward to her beloved son's triumphant return, you should smile and say, "Mother! Your beloved son has returned with freedom."</p>
<h3 id="e58">"Inspiration" <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Seeking Truth</p>
<p>The Soviet writer M. Zoshchenko, in his "How I Write," said:</p>
<p>"...I have two methods of working. One method is: whenever inspiration strikes, I write with creative impulse. At such times, the work progresses swiftly and flawlessly. The entire picture, the entire structure of things, forms naturally.</p>
<p>"The second method is when there is no inspiration. When encountering such a situation, I write using technical training. In this method of work, I proceed as one usually does with conscious effort: I build a plan for the theme myself, I appropriately arrange each paragraph and each word myself, developing a story from words..."</p>
<p>However, he later further stated, "It (inspiration) is a unique element for a writer, for all of a writer's work. Technique can certainly aid inspiration, supplement its deficiencies; it can also replace inspiration—with technique, one can ultimately avoid lowering one's own quality; however, if there is never any kind of inspiration, that writer will certainly be unable to achieve profound progress."</p>
<p>The reason why 'inspiration' is an indispensable element for literary writing is not just for the convenience of writing! Generally speaking, writing with the impulse of inspiration does indeed lead to writing that is swift and complete; moreover, it is because literature, in its expression of images, must contain moving emotions. It borrows images, passes through sensibility, and then enters into understanding. The writer's understanding, accompanied by the emotional surge of creation, can give the reader "resonance," generating the effect of literature. If there is no genuine emotion, then no matter how correct the writer's worldview is, or how skilled the technique, what is written will be at most a description of principles, a depiction of images; it will always be dead, without infectiousness. The so-called "formalism" and "eight-legged essay" (stereotyped writing), aside from problems with technique, the author's lack of inspiration is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Then what is called 'inspiration'? Zoshchenko believes that 'inspiration is a happy combination of physical health, mental strength, nervous vitality, and unwavering confidence, a combination that sends all of one's abilities to one place! In one situation—in literature.'</p>
<p>This explanation is not very clear. I believe that "inspiration" is the combination of understanding and emotion, that is, the impulse of consciousness. It is by no means the ethereal holy spirit that falls from the sky as commonly misunderstood, but a mental state produced in the practice of life through interaction with things. Therefore, inspiration is also a product of reality. Separated from reality, it is empty and false.</p>
<p>It seems that writers do not need to worry about not having inspiration. As long as you go to engage with reality, to experience life, to delve into the society you want to describe, to practice and comprehend, then, guided by your correct worldview or understanding, there will certainly be many different situations of righteous indignation arising. Only by pursuing and grasping inspiration in this way, and then writing, can you write truthfully, infectiously, and gain the reader's resonance.</p>
<p>Simply having understanding and subject matter, and writing it out raw, will ultimately make people feel forced when reading; because although this may not necessarily be a mere game of words, it ultimately fails to achieve the truthfulness of literature. Writers should restore understanding to phenomena, restore subject matter to reality—that is, they must practice life, so that understanding and subject matter are tempered and melted by the emotions from which they arise, concretely becoming true inspiration, and then written out. Only then will it be good.</p>
<p>Of course, if one already has such inspiration, writing will be even easier to succeed. I hope that they can boldly write more.</p>
<p>×× After the Arson—Engraved by Tang Yingwei</p>
<h3 id="e59">Jottings from a March <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Passing through downstairs, behind it is the real Confucius Temple. The Chinese-style tiled house, the main hall is full of gilded plaques, but the corners of the house are leaking piles of ash and dirt; the east and west side rooms are overgrown with tall artemisia, and the house is so crooked that it will collapse with a gust of wind. From the broken opening of the leak, sparrows fly in and out, unimpeded. It is said that the scholars of the past doubly cherished living things, so, in this side room of the seventy-two disciples, attracting sparrows to nest, their spirits in heaven should express welcome, right?</p>
<p>Thinking back to those years, it was really not an easy thing for Confucius to travel around in a carriage. Compared to our marching, although we only walk on foot, our spirit is still quite cheerful; as for the old Confucius, although he sat in the military vehicle, he could avoid physical fatigue, but thinking of being blocked everywhere, unable to find a way out on the political stage, and having to use lecturing to comfort his own suffering, it is truly a world of difference!</p>
<p>June - Arrived at the encampment - Old River Street</p>
<p>This day, the team encamped at Old River Street. This small town has a layer of surrounding walls on the outside, like all the towns and cities along the way. Near the town, there are bunkers towering at the corners. In the past, the surrounding walls and bunkers were the so-called solid defense lines for the people to defend public security; but now not even the shadow of an armed comrade can be seen, whether on the bunkers or beside the surrounding walls.</p>
<p>On both sides of the entrance to the street, paper slogans occupy all the empty space, pasted in layers, as if giving the surrounding walls several layers of clothing. Looking into the street, you are struck everywhere by a scene of peace and tranquility. Playing mahjong, chatting idly, smoking water pipes—enough leisure.</p>
<p>The place where we live is a large house at the head of the street. Upon arrival, people compete to wash their feet, and then lie down on the tables and benches to rest, because everyone's legs are sore and painful from walking. To fall asleep here is truly a rare and happy thing.</p>
<p>The quartermaster in charge of food cannot sleep. He comes in once and goes out once, busy without stopping, only hearing him anxiously shout:</p>
<p>"What to do, we can't buy rice!" In a moment, he is complaining again:</p>
