<p>社評</p>
<h3>抗戰建國與民主政治</h3>
<p>抗戰建國大業之最後勝利成功，其重要條件之一，厥為實行集中領導下之民主政治，俾以密切政府與人民之聯系，發揮抗日政權之最大能力。此在國民黨臨全大會宣言，早曾有所宣示，抗戰建國綱領更有明文規定，而其後最高領袖亦曾依據革命的三民主義之精神，迭迭加闡揚，勉勵全國。國民參政會之成立，卽係依據抗戰建國之需要，而開中國民治歷史上空前光榮之頁。</p>
<p>夫民主主義，平等而已。在此全世界反法西斯反侵略鬥爭中，其所企求者卽係世界和平與民主，蘇聯，英，美，法各國政府或人民，方在為保衛民主與和平而鬥爭，保衛民主政治已成當前主要之任務。我國今日所以痛遭炮火轟炸鐵蹄蹂躝者，悉受日本法西斯侵略者之進攻所賜，故我國今日爭取民族獨立自由之抗日戰爭，亦為世界反法西斯反浸畧鬥爭，同時亦為保衛民主和平之義戰。我國全國團結之抗日戰爭，實與全世界反法西斯侵略之鬥爭，具有不容分割之偉大意義，此就國際意義而証今日我國發展民主政治之必要也。</p>
<p>同時更有為吾人所不能忽視者，厥為我欲求抗戰建國之最後勝利成功，勢非實現全中華民族所有民衆力量之總動員不可，此固盡人皆知事實，亦為中樞政策及各方努力求其實現之當前緊急任務也。然如何達到全民族生動力量之集中於抗戰建國事業乎？最近全國國民精神總動員，蓋其主要辦法之一，而實現抗戰時期之民主政治，俾發揚民族之自尊心與自信心，俾發揮民衆之自動性創造性與積極性，献致其一切力量，以為抗戰建國大業而服務。尤為當前之急務。進一步言之，則戰時民主政治之逐漸實現，一切政治機構因而獲有適應之改善，實足以奠定未來建設三民主義新中國之基礎，而於淪陷地區抗日人民新政權之樹立，其偉大之意義，尤為明顯。此就國內意義，以證今日我國發展民主政治之必要也。</p>
<p>我國全面抗戰進入第二階段，內鑒於二十閱月英勇血戰之經騐敎訓，外應乎最近國際形勢之發展趨動向，推進戰時民主政治運動，已成當前全民族最迫切之任務；而國民參政會三次會議之偉大成就，尤使全國感覺推進民主政治服務抗戰建國運動之迫切需要，及其令人樂觀之前途，而迅速建立地方民意機關，寖成舉國一致要求。政府乃有關於限期四月一日成立各省市縣參議會之决定。吾人對於政府就內外情勢與抗戰建國急迫需要而作此適切之决定，謹為全國人民表示無限慶幸與期待之情，而就吾人愚見所及，所望於各省巿縣參議會者，猶有如下數者：</p>
<p>抗戰進向新階叚，我×漸成平衡相持形勢，我國所持以克×致果者，端賴全國民力之動員，而全國民力之動員，首在各地方政治之進步與民主力量之發揮，此各省市縣參議會之急須儘速普遍召集者，一也。國民參政會為適應抗戰建國新需要而產生之唯一民意機關，年餘以來，對於密切政府與人民聯系，奠定及鞏固民治基礎，以協助抗戰建國事業諸大端，迭有偉大貢献；此各省市縣參議會之又須發揚國民參政會此種精神者，二也。我國今日抗戰建國，係為全中華民族爭求獨立自由與幸福，係為建立國際地位平等政治地位平等經濟地位平等之三民主義新中國，實可謂為實現民主政治之鬥爭，在此鬥爭中，民力之集中旣為主要前提，而民意之發揮更為集中民力之主要前提，此為各省市參議會之更須成為事實上之地方民意機關者，三也。雖然，民意之發揮，民力之集中，夫人而知其重要矣，然徒恃政府自上而下之倡導，似猶不足以適應目前時勢之需要？故各省市縣參議會之尤有賴於全國各民族各黨派之協助政府，與各界民衆之熱烈參加者，四也。</p>
<p>國際鬥爭情勢，現已險惡萬端，抗戰建國事業，成功尚屬遼遠，凡吾同胞而謀所以救世救國與自救者，則當如何奮發直追，人人獻致其心力乎！此吾人於各省市縣參議支之不能不敬致其殷望也。</p>
<h3>今天！東方和西方　兩個光榮壯烈的節日</h3>
<p>紀念北京慘案和巴黎公社</p>
<p>三月，是熱烈偉大的革命的季節。</p>
<p>三月十八日，更是東方和西方人民革命的偉大的節日。</p>
<p>在東方，在我們中國的北平（當時叫北京），十三年前的今天，曾經發生了一件『天安鬥大慘案』。</p>
<p>在西方在法國；六十七年前（一八七一年）的今天，成立了歷史上第一次出現的勞動大衆的革命政權『巴黎公社』。</p>
<p>不論是東方的『天安門慘案』或西方的『巴黎公社』，它們所留下的光榮而壯烈的史蹟，對于正在為民族自由幸福而鬥爭的中國同胞，對於正在為世界和平正義而鬥爭的各國反法西斯反侵略的戰士，都有非常重大的意義，並且這留給我們非常深切的敎訓。</p>
<p>（一）東方的〔三一八〕</p>
<p>三月，這一個在人類爭自由的歷史上最値得紀念的不平凡的月份，十三年前（一九一六年）的今天（三月十八日），北京學生與民衆開國民大會，反對日軍炮轟大沽砲台及八國使團對我國的最後通牒，舉行示威遊行，向段祺瑞執政請願。不料羣衆剛抵執政政府前，卽遭衛隊開槍射擊，當時死傷極衆。從這一天起，北方民衆發出革命的怒吼，響應我們南方的革命行動，奠定了北伐成功的基礎。</p>
<p>（一）北京慘案的政治背景</p>
<p>民國十三年（一九二四年）的「五卅運動」以後，日本×國主義進攻中國的步驟着着加緊，尤其是鎮壓我國人民革命運動，不惜採取直接的行動。那時奉系軍閱完全在××主義的指示下鎭壓人民反×反封建的運動，而廣大羣衆亦廣泛發生反對奉糸軍閥的運動，浙奉戰爭發生，孫傳芳吳偑字等利用人民尤其是學生這種反奉怒潮，很快地在上海，在津浦擊敗了奉軍。奉軍在張作　領導下派張學良　松齡入關助戰。但在革命運動發展下，一部份軍人都受影響，卒有民國十四年（一九二五年）十月一日郭松齡的傾向革命，實行在灤州倒戈，率軍出關，勢如破竹，佔領錦州，進迫瀋陽。日本××主義乃直接帮助其工具奉系軍閥出兵二千五百佔領奉大兵工廠，火藥庫，以日軍喬裝奉軍，直接進攻郭松齡軍，另以飛機八十架轟炸郭軍。郭軍終於十二月二十五日慘敗，郭亦被捕遇害。</p>
<p>日本××主義自進兵滿州擊敗了帶有反日與革侖性的郭松齡軍以後，就進一步號召張作霖吳佩孚的聯合，並助吳以巨欵，供給張宗昌等以軍械子彈，軍事人材，企圖根本消滅與人民革命接近的國民軍。當國民第一軍連勝直魯聯軍的時候，日本××的艦隊突然砲擊大沽砲台，勾引奉艦襲取天津，以為張宗白李景林的應援，並且用八國公使團的最後通牒，施行威嚇。</p>
<p>此時我國廣大的民衆，以男女學生為先鋒，英勇直前的向××主義者進行一致的抵抗和反攻，我們反對日軍侵進東三省與奉直軍閥聯合，我們反對張吳的示威　動和督促國民政府北伐的呼聲遍於全國。於是革命與反動勢力的鬥爭廣泛地慘酷地展開了，北京大安門的大慘案亦就在這時發生。</p>
<p>（二）北京慘案的經過</p>
<p>當時的北京　從「五卅運動」發生之後，革命與反動勢力鬥爭情緒，一天高漲一天，那兒的學生，和市民羣衆，會經為紀念「五七」，為反對關稅會　，為實行首都革命，早與當地軍警一再發生衝突流血的事件。到了一九二六年的三月十八日這一天，北京的學生，工人，市民，成千成萬地集合起來，激昂地為反對日艦轟擊大沽，反對公使團的哀的美敦書，在夭安門舉行國民大會，會後舉行巡行示威。高呼「打倒××主義」「××日本××主義」「打倒賣國的段××」「驅逐八國公使」等口號。並向段祺瑞執政的國務院請願。然而當時的賣國政府領袖段××章×，××為了仇恨人民自救救國的運動，為了進行五千萬的借欵之故，竟執行八國公使團特別是日本××的指示，而下令向民衆開槍—在十餘分鐘的　　之下，當場死二十六人，重傷二百餘人，在醫院因傷致死的亦二千餘人。這是日本××主義經過賣國政府段××鎭壓人民革命運動的「三一八」壓史慘劇，自此以後，在××主義指使奉直軍聯合進攻之下，國民軍被迫退囘內蒙及西北一帶，而北方革命運動卽暫時表現相當消沉的狀態，張吳會見於北京，反動勢力又囂張起來，積極向人民革命勢力進攻，積極製造黑暗與恐怖。這些反動份子的集團在××主義尤其是日本××主義領導之下，組織「反赤大同盟」等，進行所謂「反共」工作，藉口「反赤」「反共」的名義，以進行反革命和賣國的活動。</p>
<p>（三）北京慘案的經驗與教訓</p>
<p>從「三一八」北京慘案的事實，可以知道直接開槍擊殺民衆的，固然是當時賣國殃民的執政政府，然而造成這次事變，促動這次事變的都是××主義，尤其是日本××。它竭力帮助反動勢力，出面打擊當時的革命力量，促動當時的所謂執政政府來屠殺人民，進行『以華制華』的毒策。因此，我們更應該明切注意到：第一，日本××今天仍在利用舊的新的明目的替伏的人民大衆的劊了手，來組織傀儡政府，漢奸政府，現在所有漢奸政府中的要角，他們從「三一八」當時就或明或暗地為日×殘殺中國人民的創子手和漢好了。我們今日抗戰，不只淸算『九一八』或『七七』事變以來的血賬，而是淸算歷史上所累積下來的血賬。我們今日要踏着『三一八』諸烈士的血路前進，我們必須也必能完成他們的木竟之志！</p>
<p>第二，「三一八」當時人民革命運動，雖然如此忠勇壯烈，但是終因革命勢力方面的統一戰綫沒有團結得鞏固組織得嚴密，一方面未能更廣泛的動員工農和小市民，更未能從反動軍閥的政府和軍警中間去爭取友軍；另一方面則當時革侖中樞尙在南方，南北人民革命鬥爭尙未取得密切聯系。消些痛苦的經騐應該敎訓我們，當此抗戰轉向第二階段之際，我們要加緊鞏固全國的團結，擴大民族統一戰線，發展領導各民族抗戰的政黨，同時在意到國際上甚至×人陣營中去爭取更多的友軍！</p>
<p>第三，「三一八」當時，×人的聯合戰綫佔據相當的優勢，日本××主義一面利用我國反動勢力漢奸政府，一面還聯台××主義列强，如八國公使團的向我提出最後通牒等。當今抗戰轉向第二階段×人困難日趨嚴重之際，×人當然絕不放鬆一貫陰謀的實施，所以我們今日更應注力於：（一）指出日德意三侵略國聯合進攻中國推進世界大戰的嚴重情勢。（二）指出日德意侵略集團進攻央法美等民主和平國家的陰謀，號召英法美等民主和平國家，為保衛其正當權益地位及世界和平，只有加緊聯合蘇聯援助中國及一切被侵略國族。（三）揭發日本××今日加緊利用過去或明或暗地屠殺人民的漢妤創子手，藉「反共」·「和平」口號，以圖離間我團結，破壞我抗戰，達到其迅速征服中國的陰謀。我們還要加緊肅淸明目的和潛伏的，違反抗戰建國主張的，一切「反共」「主和」」「排斥歐美」一日滿支集團」等等言論和行動。</p>
<p>（二）西方的〔三一八〕</p>
<p>六十七年前的今天，一八七一年三月十八日，法國勞苦大衆成立「巴黎公社」的光榮偉大的紀念日，不僅對於世界各國求自由的人類，而且對於英勇抗戰中的我國同胞，亦有其非常重大的意義。</p>
<p>（一）〔巴黎公社〕的成功和失敗</p>
<p>一八七〇年，普法之戰中，德國的鐵血宰相俾斯麥，戰敗了法國，法皇拿破崙第三被俘，普王在巴黎城外的凡爾賽宮，即大德意志的皇位，</p>
<p>法國資產階級的政府，因為抵抗不了敵軍勢如破竹的進攻，並且畏懼繼續抗戰下去，縱使獲得勝利，其勝利「亦必為國內革命的工晨小市民大衆所獲得」，根據這種錯誤的估計　竟和普國簽訂下了喪權辱國的條約，同時對於工人市民大衆的反抗，則實行慘酷的血的壓迫，這樣，終於燃起了軍衆的革命的怒火。</p>
<p>巴黎的勞苦民衆，以工人大衆為先鋒，為了不願意當亡國奴，為了爭取法蘭西民族的獨立自由，為了反對當時一些，動搖妥協出賣民族國家利益的份子的行動，在千難萬苦的環境之中，在內外雙重鐵血壓迫之中，團結起來了，實行「執千戈以衛社稷」。三月十八日（一八七一年）就是他們建立反對侵略，反對妥協抗戰到底以求獨立自由幸福的「巴黎公社」的日子。</p>
<p>三月十八日那一天，巴黎的勞苦民衆，在工人大衆的領導之下，和國防軍兵士，舉行壯烈的武裝抗爭，並且和政府軍手携于地推倒了與×妥協出賣民族的貴族資產者的政權。降×的政府要人，都逃亡到已成為×人大本營的凡爾賽去，於是革命民衆成立了『巴黎公社』</p>
<p>「巴黎公社」是全世界歷史上第一次出現的勤勞大衆自己的政權。列寧曾經一再以長篇大論，批評這個世界上第一次出現而且一直到現在尙為各國勤勞大衆所學習的勞工政權「巴黎公社」，他說：當無產　級的羣衆運動爆發了的時候，雖然這个運動是失敗的，短期的，而且顯然是孱弱的，而馬克斯却開始去研究，這扯運動究竟發現了什麼政治形式。「公社」是由無產階級革命『終究發現了』的形式，在這種形式之下，勞動的經濟解放是可以實現的。「公社」是無產××××打破××階級的國家機器的第一次企圖，並且「終於發現了」的政治形式，這個政治形式是可以而且必須來代養巳破壞的國家機器的。』列寧接着還說出以下的事實，卽「俄國一九〇五年和一九一七年的革命，在不同的環境之中，和各異的條件之下，繼續着「巴黎公社」底事業，並且證實馬克斯那種天才的歷史的分析的正確。」</p>
<p>但是這個政權「巴黎公社」却因為沒有澈底的打擊×人，沒有建立鞏固的統一戰線，反革命派，法國的賣國賊，得在借助普國的『援助』之下實行大規模的反攻，結果是「巴黎公社」給淹沒在血肉糢糊之中，結束了它兩個多月的生命；無數爭自由的民衆，工人，遭受了慘酷的屠殺，直到賽納河的流水都給染紅！</p>
<p>（二）〔巴黎公社〕的經驗與教訓</p>
<p>西方的「三一八」，「巴黎公社」的革命，雖然只有短短的二個多月的壽命，然而它却成為全世界求自由的人類的鬥爭模範。列寧氏曾用下面的字句，描寫革命導師馬克斯氏對於『巴黎公社』的重視。「馬克斯不僅因「衝天」的「巴黎公社」社員們的英勇精神而大喜，而且他認為這次羣衆的革命運動（雖然沒有達到目的），是有偉大意義的歷史經驗，是世界××××革命的相當的前進，是較諸幾百條綱領和議論尤為重要的實際步騾。分析這個經驗，從這個經驗中得到策略的敎訓，在這個經驗的基礎上來重新審査自己的理論，這些便是馬克斯自己所認定的任務。」</p>
<p>「巴黎公社」留給我們的「偉大義的歷史經驗」是什麼呢？第一是它用推翻中途妥協出賣民族的政權的事實，替我們証明，工人羣衆，勤勞民衆，團結起來的反抗力量，是無敵的。一切被壓迫者反抗壓迫者鬥爭，必須有勤勞民衆直接主動的參加，才能最後成功。</p>
<p>第二二「巴黎公社」替我們指出革命鬥爭唯一的勝利之路，「一個眞正的民衆的革命，是要大多數民衆，在種種壓迫和剝削之的下最深的社會下層民衆，都獨立起來，他們用自己的要求，用自己的企圖在已破壞了的舊社會的廢址上，按自己的利益，而建設新社會的企圖，影響革命的半個行程」。</p>
<p>第三，他又用建立「巴黎公社」這個勤勞民衆自己的政權一事，替我們說明，勤勞民衆應當破壞並打碎「現成的國家機噐一而不僅限於簡單的奪取這個機器。</p>
<p>第四，用什麼來代替打破了的國家機構呢？「巴黎公社」又用提示了勝利的事實答復我們，那就是要用「××××卽勤勞大衆自己的組織成為統治階級」，以「民主制之獲得來代替它。「巴黎公社」第一個法令，就是　常備軍而代之武裝民衆。「巴黎公社」依照普通選舉制由巴黎各區所選出來的城市代表所組織。他們是完全負責的，並且隨時可以更換的。他們大多數是　人，或被認為是工人階級的代表。向來是國家政府之工的警察，立刻被革除了它的一切政治職務，而變為公社的負責機關，其他一切行政機關的官吏也是一樣。從公社社員起，自上至下，一切為社會服務的人員。祗給以工人的工資。一切國家的特權以及辦公費，都跟着這些官吏本身的消滅而同歸於盡。『巴黎公社』大多數的民衆能代替享有特權的少數人實現了（特權的官吏常備軍的將領）的特殊機關，自己直接執行一切職務，國家政權職務日益由全體民衆來執行。它從資產階段的民主制變為勞動民衆的民主制，從壓迫者的民主制變為被壓迫者的民主制。</p>
<p>第五『巴黎公社』採取了新的制度，來代替資本主義社會的賣身的腐敗的代議制，在這種新的制度之下，有判斷和討論的自由，代表們必須自己　作，必須自己執行自己的法律，必須自已來檢察實際生活所得的給果，而且還必須自己直接來對選舉者負責，它替我們證明：「要把官吏制度到處立刻澈底消滅，這是一種鳥托邦，　但是一舉而把舊的官吏機關　號，而立刻建設一個新的組鐵，使漸次能够消滅一切官吏制度，這是可能的，革命的勤勞大衆面接的當前的任務。</p>
<p>第六，『巴黎公社」的經驗又吿訴我們「民族的統一」是不應該破壞的。反之，它應該籍公社制度的方法組織起來。民挨的統一應當成為實際。其方法就是消滅那自認為是這個統一的體現者，但同時却欲離民族而獨立，且立於民族之上的國家政權。要把覺悟的民主的勤勞民衆的集中主義來與資資階級的軍閥的僚官的集中主義相對立。</p>
<p>「巴黎公社」雖然創造了這許多具有偉大意義的歷史經驗，但是它本身是在兩個月的光榮歷史之下失敗了，它的失敗，第一是當時的客觀環境尙未充分成熟，第一是他們沒有澈底消滅法國和外國反革命的努力，使×人得以從容實行大規模的大聯合總反攻，而遭遇不可挽救的慘敗，第三是他們本身的統一戰綫並沒有鞏固和發展，領導的黨沒有親密團結各黨，同時忽略了農村工作，不能把廣大的農民靠衆團結在自己的周圍，坐使×方得從容施行挑撥離間，計，坐使農民變作進攻巴黎的有力的隊伍。</p>
<p>（三）總結</p>
<p>總結東方和西方兩個「三一八」的光榮偉大的節日，所留給我們的經騐和敎訓，配合着我們中華民族抗日戰爭新階段的新環境和新任務，我們今日必須循北京慘案和巴黎血戰諸烈土的血路，更英勇地邁進，推進反法西斯反侵略的鬥爭，實現民族的獨立自由和世界眞正的和平。同時我們還要接受北京慘案和巴黎血戰的經騐敎訓，一面加緊我們內部的團結，擴展我們的統一戰綫，增加我們在國際在×人陣營內的援助力量，特別是由推進發展各省市縣參議會開始，積極實施民主政治，以便全民族尤其是工農勞動民衆的生動力量，都能集中在統一的領導之下為抗戰建國而服務。另一方面，則須加緊打破×人利用漢奸叛徒「反共」「主和」「中途妥協」等言論行動以達「以華制華」的陰謀，加緊增加×人的國內，軍隊內和國際上的困難，堅决支持持久抗戰，爭取最後勝利。</p>
<h3>日本自由主義者的沒落（二）</h3>
<p>— 賀塞爾原著</p>
<p>原文載〔亞細亞雜誌〕</p>
<p>各政府機關官吏也是一樣的，大家都感覺自己份內的事情是被軍事機關侵佔了，我發現外務省的人就大不滿意，尤其是那倒霉的東亞局裏面的人，此外有些人因為在政府裏面供職，有機會知道日本財政內幕的情形，則認為日本的存金和現欵都不足以支持一個擴大的對華戰事。</p>
<p>日本大多數的議員也都是自由主義者，前回有三個　員和幾個美國新聞記者舉行非正式談話，他們在討論各項問題的時候都表現驚人的開闊的胸襟，尤其在討論日蘇兩國關係的時候，新聞記者當中的自由主義者也佔很大的白分比，他們現在也還可以罵罵內閣的閣員，但遇到和軍部有關的時候就不能不委婉一點了，他們可以做文章來討論各種軍事問題，不過送到檢查處的時候便給扣起來了，最後說到日本天皇旁邊的一批政治元老，他們也都是傾向自由主義的，除掉唯一無　的元老西圜寺而外，如平沼，牧野，松平，金于，淸浦等人，都還可以看出些明治時代的傳統思想。</p>
<p>日本的自由主義者旣然佔據了這許多社會的部門，所以當局人也便把他們看得比共產黨和職工份子還更可怕。日本有的是很完備的司法機關和嚴密的警察組織，那些在下層蠢動的人是不難一網打盡的，但要對付自由主義者可不這樣容易，他們現在都盤據　機要的地方，他們的計劃也非地方檢察官之耳目所能及　他們有的是潛勢力，說不定在一晚上的工夫便能轉變國家最重要的問題，而發揮其全部力量。</p>
<p>自由主義者在日本的地位，和在其他極權國家如德意兩國的地位，其根本不岡之點便在于此。我們在上面便說過，他們現在仍舊盤據着要津，一旦有了組織的行動，那就一定會風　全國。他們動起來也不難得到皇室的支持，這確是日本現在最複雜困難的一點。　（未完）</p>

<h3>荊沙青年戰地服務團（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>話劇歌詠的演唱，次數更不勝枚　。嘗與民運組台作，發動組織民衆，先組成　　工人工會，計有會　千一白餘人；其次，打　廠工人工會，有一千三百人；戲劇協會　有四百數十人；以及人力車天工會，醫　協會等等，總計在該團掌握下有糾織的民衆團體，有州六個同業工會，共計一萬數十人。該團在各大產業遷移內地後，發動獻金運動，於短短定期三內，卽能得金十萬餘元，就是他們能確實掌握羣衆的一種良如成績的表現。</p>
<p>該團在發動獻金之先，會分別向各衆工會　宣傳献金　義，幷預定全巿献金總數十萬元，按各會營衆的榮枯狀况，來　認獻多寡的標準。如打包廠工人，認獻數為五百元。屆期竟　出一千元。中有十五齡的一個女工，將具半年工資，除巳用生活費外尙有貯欵十三元，完全獻出。戲劇協會認獻五百元，俱無期所收演劇捐，未到獻時，卽超過六百元。一　伶表演名劇，於萬頭續仰之際，忽現身說法，提倡獻金，除她本人自捐五十外，觀衆當場又視獻得數百元。具他各業，亦多如此　躍捐獻，故成續斐然可觀。然而，這也是該　發揮「領導由上而下，推動由下而上』的精神，先將軍民打或一片，以後才能獲得美滿結果。</p>
<p>留着于右任式滿鰓美髯的該團團長劉礱潮先生，確與團員及傳令兵穿　同樣質料的軍服，佩少將章，威風凜鑲，頗有『老將黃忠』之槪。其實問及他的「貴庚」，他才卅四歲。前在中山大學當哲學主任敎授，入過抗×幹部訓練班。目前受抗援會委託，領導這般少年從事抗戰工作，所以能措施裕如，替荊沙民衆力量培植出一朶鮮花來。</p>
<p>團員中有好幾個靑年，他們都到旅館里來和我談過。他們是二十歲上下的靑年，大槪受了輕佻的雪風的吹噓，兩頰浮放着靑春的緋紅；尤具態度　容得像「世代書　」的子弟，眞　文文雅雅的！無怪有個從樓上斜看下來的朋友，還把他們誤認成是「女同志」哩。可是他們萃於心，盎于背的眞精神，却充分顯不着他們已具有一個戰士所必具的基本條件：健壯的體魄，堅定的决心　機警。並且，他們曾小試其錄，抓過幾個漢奸槍斃了。</p>
<p>我們不早不遲，剛剛幸運生在這個民族復興大時代的中華兒女們，所謂「八仙過海，各顯奇能」，如不趕快各就力量所及：有錢的出錢，有力的出力，有才（計劃）的出才，乘機會各去建立殊勛，將更待何時？</p>
<h3>滬英商會發表宣言　暴露×在華北經濟陰謀　號召各方一致促其失敗</h3>
<p>【路透社上海十七日電】此間英商會主席馬歇爾爵士，今日發表鄭重官言一通。代表英商會，對日本在華北實施新幣制事，提出嚴重抗議，該宣言書全文如下：</p>
<p>偽「華北臨時政府」之新幣制，於三月十一日，開始在華北各大城市及港口付諸實施，地點計包括北乎，天津，靑島。烟台及威海衛各處。該新幣制之目的，乃在逐出中國法幣，而流通偽『聯合凖備銀行』鈔票，此項　『聯合準備銀行』之鈔票，與日元有密切聯繫，準備金極不允足。以外匯言之，毫無價値，而中國法幣則有充足準備金，在外匯市場，具有規定之價儲。</p>
<p>偽「臨時政府」，為欲使『準備銀行』鈔蔡　通起見，乃禁止海關批准貨品輸出，而令定貨者至正金銀行，以十四先令之定價，購賈「準備銀行」外匯；此種措施，顧然逐漸造成日本銀行趨于財政獨佔之局勢。目若商業在此種基礎之下不斷進行。則凖備金不足之偽『準備銀行』鈔票，反以外匯為支持矣。此種强逼流通「凖備銀行」鈔票之結果，當使大部外人商業，瀕於停業或關閉。因彼等不能以無法兌換外匯之鈔票，進行交易。此在日本商人，其地位則有不同，因彼等可以接受「準備銀行」鈔票，而以之在日本購貨也。同時，此項新幣制，首先自當影響中國貨物之出口商，不久之後，外貨（非日貨）進口商，亦當受同等影響　——卽以出口貿易擔得之外匯，卽『準備銀行』鈔票，亦無法保証其可用於進口貿易，且其結果，非日貨之進口貿易額必銳滅。其尤有進者，卽令換得外匯可用於進口貿易，然其不充足之凖備價値，徒使分配制度操於「準備銀行」之手，造成違反現行條約，進行統制與限制外貨之進口矣。</p>
<p>此項强制在華北施行不充足準備金之幣制，必使英國援濟及分配之來源去路，受到驅劣影響。如日本此項促使中國幣制與日元發生聯繫，竟獲成功，則一切外商，勢將大蒙其害，猶如在滿洲所悲慘遭受者相同。是以此項新幣制，對英國利益，實屬異常不公，而尤違於門戶開放及機會均等之原則，吾人勢應盡最大努力，促其失效。英蘭會頃對此種非法計劃，提出嚴重抗議，因不但損及英商利益，且害及一切非日本方面之利益，而其結果，當投害於更大之區　云。</p>
<h3>地方金融會議　孔祥熙閉會詞　今後還應刻苦努力　聯絡合作提拔人才</h3>
<p>在這次財政部召開地方金融會議、在短短的五天會期中、諸位都能够聚精會神、詳細報吿、和精密討論、幷且在審查和討論的時候、都能够發揮自己從經騐方面、學識方面、所得到的了解、和貢献國家社曾的策略、意義是非常重大的、</p>
<p>今天最高領袖在訓話中、曾指示我們在抗戰時期有三件要事、一是軍事、二是敎育、三是經濟、經濟與財政息息相關、而財政又為一切事業之母、沒有財政則一切都是紙上空談、無從實現、所以要維持財政的來源、就要發展經濟、而發展經濟、又以鞏固金融、幷求其發展為最重要、</p>
<p>諸君來自各地、或掌管地方財政、或主持地方金融、責任都非常重大、在此非常時期能够緊首一堂、共同討論種種貢献國家大計、以達抗戰必成的目的、這檯機會、可以說是于古難得的、</p>
<p>近時有許多人議論政府的開會毛病、說是會而不議、議而不决、决而不行、行而不力、這大概是因為一般的會議與會的人員、都喜歡提案、議案太多、一時也討論不完、于是祇好送交政府核辦了事、此次會議議案、雖不甚多、但是關係抗戰建國和復興民族甚大、這司說是歷史上的會議、其重要的性質、自與平常一般會議不同、我們經過細的研究討論、已經决定了很好計劃、就必須一一見諸實行、决不可置之高閣、希望各位明瞭自己所負責任與使命之重大、回到本地後、　着計劃切實去做、力矯以往的毛病、</p>
<p>今後最高領袖訓話說、「金融界過去種種的措置、對國家都很有點貢献」、我們的軍器確實是不如人、可是我們的金融制度、經濟組　是×人所畏惟的、雖然×人用盡種種方法、要破壞我們的金融、破壞我們的經濟、但都枉費心機、毫無結果、現在我們的法幣信用、雖經過長時間的們爭、依然是很鞏固、卽國際方面、也獲到非常的地位信譽、匯豐銀行股東年會的報吿、及英國財相西門的演辭、對于我們法幣的信用、都備極讀揚、不但是第三者態度如此、連×人方面的學者專家所著的論說、也不能不承認這是事實、由此可以知到中國的幣制金融、在國際上巳得到相當的地位、</p>
<p>但是這種成續和信譽的獲得、决非由僥倖獲致或偶然、而是過去許多人費去多少心血、然後得到的、對于抗戰建國復興民族是有很大的裨益、我們不但要維持這種局面、還要把他推進擴張、所以我們今後還得要下番刻苦功夫、繼續努力、此次會議、旣有詳的計劃、就要按步就班、努力推行、此外還要聯絡合作、要有整个的計劃、整个的組織、决不能各行其是、漫無準　、本人此次出席敎育會議、曾對與會人員說過、敎育為國家之母、我們今後的敎育要養成適合于下列四種條件的人才、一、有高尙的人格、二、有健全的體魄、三、有適用的技能、四、有合羣的精神、這不但是敎育方面如此辦理、今後諸位訓總人才、也要如此、過去敎育的結果、一方面從學校畢業的人才、都感覺無事可做、一方面社會又覺無可用之才、學校畢業學生、不合于社會需要、而社會又不能容納這班人才、這就是過去敎育的缺點、今後金融界方面、對于具備上述四種條件的人才、都要亦以獎勵、培養後進、提拔人才、這事是金融界很重要的一種任務、</p>
<p>近來交通不大方便、各位又都各有任務、不能在此久留、所以此次會議今犬就吿結束、希望各位都能本着這次會議的方案、切實聯合各方實行、並選撐能够帮助自己的人才、予以適當訓練　　、是卽所以帮助國家、今天本人所說的話、不無可供各位參攷的價値、望格外努力、希望此次戰爭、能够戰勝×人、早日結束、在三民主議之下、建設中國、不由是要復興中華民族、而日是要達到以天下為公、世界大同的最高目的、</p>

<p>護衛方法　足毀潛艇</p>
<p>今後潜水艇之威脅、當不若上次大戰時之嚴重、吾人觀乎統計之結果、可知歐戰將結束時所採取之「護衛」制度、乃至成功者、吾國海軍部與造船工業經二年密切之合作、現能於戰爭爆發後、依任何必要之路綫、立卽創設一護衛一組織、現吾人儲有攻擊潛水艇之槍械甚多、足敷應用、立即可以使用者逾二千枝、在相當之時期內、更可有大批之增加、待本年年底、吾人可以預料有商船千艘、其艙面均將裝運槍械、現有商船官員九千餘人、正硏求『護衛』之課程、一且戰爭爆發、政府將取得大批船隻、以供海軍攻擊潛水蜓之用、余相信英海軍搜尋、偵察與毀滅敵方之潛水艇之方法、乃世上之最佳者憶一九三八年一月英國宣佈擊沉某海面下之任何潜水艇、俾消除地中海之海盜行為、此項宣佈以後、即無海盜案發規、吾願本院諸君自行推求結論也、</p>
<p>艦上防空設備增強</p>

<p>長江仍有英國砲艦</p>
<p>工黨議　亞力山大稱、渠並未批　長江區域海軍官員、唯批評渠等所行施之政策而已、渠並提及日海相關於重開長江事之宣言、列魏林中校答稱、「此係外交部之事、然吾人仍有砲艦駐泊畏江、此等砲艦過去曾完成良好之工作、深得該地人民之稱謂、余尙憶及漢口英商會向霍爾達海軍少將表示謝忱也一、</p>

<h3>新中環街市剖視</h3>
<p>— 憧憬</p>
<p>如果整潔而現代式的街市，是十足表徵城市的衞生行政的優良或進步，那麼，香港近年來極力增建或改建街市是値得設耀的，像今年五月初就要開幕的中環得市，罕少在香港衛生行政成績上，相加不鮮光　！</p>
<p>這街市前年頭還是一座數十年的古舊的建築物，黑暗，骯髒，昏吳的魚味從裏面透出來，使每個走過它門前的人，停着呼吸急步流過去。今後這情形，恐怕不會再有了！它目前已變成一座新頴整潔的大建築物，從他門口經過的人們，這時却用「刮目相看」的眼光來睢雎它。</p>
<p>這新街市的建設，對于販家和顧客不僅顧存到雙方交易底便利，但相信世界各地街市，也沒有別的像這一個這麽樣講究公共衞生的。</p>
<p>這街市有四層樓它外表批邊着靑色的精緻美，很可以表現出它內部的潔淨。是的，它內部是嵌着乳白的磁片，這對于洗工作是最容易的。目前計劃是把它最頂的一層做潔凈局及職員辦公室，其餘三層做買賣的地方，預算它的地下有五十個魚攤，和四十五個鷄鴨攤，每個魚攤的後面有一個科學化的雙層魚池。而鷄鴨攤則有便利于宰殺的設備，而且也有一個小小的儲藏鷄鴨食糧庫。二樓呢，有猪肉攤五十個，牛肉攤三十個。三樓則有生菓攤和菜蔬攤，前者佔五十個，後者佔三十個。</p>
<p>這裏的攤子都是做零星買賣的，批發生意就要讓堅尼地城街市去做了。但，這街市在交通方面，我不要志記把釆吿訴讀者的，它有四個大門口，南鬥向皇后大道，北門向德輔道，這兩個門口都是顧客出入口：至於西邊租卑利街和東便域多利街，那有一道橫門，為貨物出人口，東角的平台則為便利汽車落貨而設的。那車還有一個很大的　梯，可容納二十個人的，這電梯設在北鬥孔道之側。</p>
<p>總之，整個的街市是一個新型的建築物，在衛生上，買賣便利上，甚至市容上，都可使香港增光不少的，在管理上香港政府要感謝市政衞生局，在設計上則歸功于工務局則師鶴殊士，在灌注三合土工程上則推華諾爾工程師，而在打椿工程和裝飾就是溫華路公司和德興公司。這街市在道新陳代替之間，影嚮香港社會的另一轉變情形，也不能忽略的，而且，這轉變也是一段和商業上發生相當連鎖性的。那麽，我們試囘憶一下吧，前年這街市折卸那兒，它的肉攤和魚攤通通般到上環街市那裏，　麽一來，就把上環街市原有的魚攤迫遷到西環，把菜攤迫到摩囉街。而後來的街輔道和大道中于是發現許多新張旗鼓的生菓店子了。</p>
<p>現在，新中環街市快開幕了，我們大家可以想得出照上面轉　的方法，做一個「變本還原」的循環律！</p>
<h3>救濟糧荒　港米商規劃　運洋米返粵　已電安暹訂購鉅量穀米　向澳及內地同業商合作</h3>
<p>潮汕番順中及五邑各縣米荒潮、現已日呈尖銳、各縣當局及旅港各縣僑團、莫不騷然而起、紛謀設法救濟、一方面疊電中央請免洋米進口稅、一方面則積極募欵、準備購辦大量洋米、返囘內地各米荒區舉辨平糶、俾拯救行將變為餓殍之數千萬民衆、不致陷于飢寒絕境、昨記者據港中米行人消息、謂內地各縣米荒之救濟、勢不能稍緩、且為發展業之良機、故在各僑團奔走呼號之下、該行中人、亦起而規劃乘時辦運大量洋米返內地散售、期迅速充裕各縣米源、不致為一二奸商乘機操縱圖利、而予一般民衆以巨大痛苦、關于此種計劃之推進、現經决定整個步驟、分別辦理、首似于日間遣派人員、赴澳門及五邑各重要市鎭、向當地同業中人接洽、實行彼此合作作有計劃之推銷洋米期翁于內地民衆糧上、能作相當裨助、同時並與各縣當局洽商俾于運輸上能得若干助力、减輕種種窒碍與困、難</p>
<p>同時擬由澳中同業會同澳中僑團領袖、向澳當局接洽、請准許將來辦運洋米假道澳門、予以通融辦理、另一方面則開始向安暹等地陸續訂購巨量谷米返港、分批轉連內地、最近數日間、已有若干大米行經去電安暹、訂購相當數量谷米、準備短期間內、開始運來云、</p>
<h3>加強救亡統一戰線　全港婦女團結起來！　婦女四聯會今開會討論　邀各婦團參加擴大組織</h3>
<p>【本報特訊】自抗戰展開、本港各婦女救亡會、紛紛成立、然因種種關係、各相隔閡、聯結之機會尙少、對於工作進行、頗多不便、在是次三八婦女節紀念大會中、何香凝女士曾公開提議、在座各婦女團體、卽席成立香港婦女聯合大會、本港慰勞分會因此昨亦特去函婦女四聯會、倡議擴大四聯會組織、加入港中各婦女團體、成立香港婦女聯席會、自此消息發表後、社會人士、異常注意、記者昨特分訪四婦女聯會及本港各婦女團體主事人、探詢各人對此事之態度、據四婦女聯會各負責人表示、均贊同此議、其餘各婦女團體均熱烈擁護此舉、查四聯會已定於今日午前十一時假婦女兵災會、召開會議、切實討論、準備通過接納、幷分函末加入各婦女團體邀請加入、查未加入之團體、有杳港中國婦女會、中華婦女節約協會華商分會、南華體育會女子部、陶化大同工會、鴨利洲婦女賑災會、晨光社、香港九龍婦女策進會、餘閒樂社女子部等、查上述婦女團體包括工商學農各界、人數達萬五千餘云、　（洛）</p>
<h3>私梟猖獗日甚　公然武裝走私　配備槍械在港邊界橫行無忌　鎢砂生絲等由內地大量運港</h3>
<p>廣東海瘁線延長、又因與英領香港接壤關係、私梟活動特形猖獗、尤其是華南戰事發生、廣州淪陷後、戰區海關、均已撤銷、瀕海關口、亦多被×炮燬、無從辨公、因此一般私梟、遂認此為千載一時之機、益加猖獗、公然武裝走私、偷運物品來往本港與內地、川流不息、橫行無忌、影響國家稅收、殊為重大、</p>
<p>深圳河上走私捷徑</p>
<p>目下華南走私路線甚多、其最顯著者、厥為中英交界之寶家縣境、寶安與新界接壤僅隔一深河、該河上游水淺、可步行而過、在昔此路走私已甚猖獗、一般私梟、每於黑夜、乘各關員巡查稍疏之際、卽由保安方面、偷渡過深河、走入英界、我國關員軍警雖於事後發覺、亦無法追捕、計偷運來港者以砂最為大宗、次為生鹽、及煙酒等、至由本港偷運入內地者、則為火水、糖、及洋貨之類、</p>
<p>武裝出入　橫行無忌</p>
<p>近私梟愈來愈兇、公然配備槍械、明目偷運、有時槍枝多者不下二三十枝、少者亦有十枝八枝、有時雖為關員發覺、亦不畏懼、必要時則鳴槍與抗、其斗胆情形可見、據悉此輩走私者多為土匪及地痞之流、亦有不少為散失之土乒、彼輩所用之槍械有不少槍米自×軍手上者、故能橫行無忌也、</p>
<p>大量生絲　偷運來港</p>
<p>至粤江流域、中山、甫海、順德、東莞縣屬、亦為私梟出入孔道、其所經之地若為淪陷區者、則向廣州×軍事當局及本港日本領事署領出通過證、用小艇運載貨物通過淪陷區內、運至伶仃洋外海面、用駁艇轉載來港、其由本港偷運入內地者則由民船載運至伶仃洋附近由小艇轉載入內地發售、查由賅地偷運出口者、以順德之生絲最多、查目下內地生絲每担不過港幣一百元、而偷運來港者、則售價在三百元以上、其獲利之深可想見、</p>
<p>鵭砂食鹽　偷運不絕</p>
<p>此外尙有一偷運私貨來港之路線、為粤東之海陸豐縣屬該地與本港領海接近不遠、出入便利、且當地關卡多被×軍炮燬、已無存在、是以走私情形亦甚嚴重、由該地汕尾方面偷運來港者以鎢砂及食鹽最多、一般私梟每於黑搬運落船揚帆運載來港、由港運入該處者則以日用品及最洋貨多云、</p>
<h3>今日特別賽馬　下午二時開跑共賽九場</h3>
<p>自春季賽馬大會結朿以後、已經休息兩個星期、今天又在快活谷舉行第一次特別賽馬、準下午兩點鐘開跑、共賽九塲、如果天氣能够晴明、相信熱鬧情形、也會和大會時差不多、但草塲給幾天大雨所影響、馬兒將來賽跑的總時間必定不會太快、要創出新紀錄恐怕不是易事吧、今年特別賽馬總共有十三次、上半年至六月份止、占了六次、下半年至十二月止、占了七次、今天九場賽跑、有五場是遺材賽、限於在大會中未勝過一次的馬兒方能參加、其餘四場就是新舊馬讓賽、此次賽後、馬會卽按照各馬的成績實行分班、中國馬仍編五班、澳洲馬仍編三班、將來特別賽馬的節目却以讓賽為主、看今年新馬多屬利害傢伙、混合舊馬賽跑時、更要好看煞人也、</p>
<h3>南渡謀生者仍眾　星洲船票漲達二百元　貨船客票亦漲至百八十元</h3>
<p>年來因我國工人、前赴星洲各屬謀生者衆、不以當地膠錫業冷淡、失業人數衆多、而稍受影嚮、星洲當局、為維持失業工人起見、去年曾迭頒限制華工入口明令、男女新客入境、每月不得超過五百名、但仍不足以遏阻華工之南渡、每月由本港出口前往南洋人數、仍有超過定額、其已領得出國護照候輪南渡者、尙不勝其數、因而一般與有關係之商人、莫不認此為侔利機會、船票價格、一再高漲、迭破歷來紀錄、查星洲客票低廉、船公司原規定為每票八十元、因星洲當局限制入口、南渡人數衆多、同時又有人從中操縱、致一再飛漲、最近竞每具價口價至二百元有奇、創空前高價紀錄、又除客給外、港星間貨船、其領有十餘客位、近因客票漲價、南渡華工、多利其價廉、多趁貨給南渡、此項貨船客票、向未有底價規定者、近亦以改趁貨船者多、亦有人從中包攬操縱、每一客票亦漲價至一百八十元有奇、因客位無多、供求不應、取購亦異常困難云、</p>

<h3>日棉紗運港混銷　改換商標運來各廠竟多採用　廠商聯會已停簽國貨證明書</h3>
<p>本港棉紗回採購目英國日本及上海、自華中淪為戰區、英國修改特惠稅則例後、日本及上海棉紗之輸港數量、於去秋間曾極度縮減、惟最近又呈復甦氣象、且據工業界息、大量日本棉紗在滬改換商標運港推銷、因價格低廉關係、此間識造廠頗多採用、記者復查悉部份棉織品廠商、年來均向廠商聯合會領取國貨証明書、以便運銷南洋各埠、惟最近該會宣佈暫時停發、至華商織造會方面、傳亦採取同等步驟、惟該會當局予以否認、但領取證明書時、須得檢查員檢查准、並由主席簽字云、據關係方面消息、現時因棉紗之來源淆混、辨別殊非易事、相信停止發給國貨證明書之原因、即基於此云、</p>

<h3>新淡水巡禮（續）</h3>
<p>— 復然</p>
<p>（四）沉下去、失敗主義者</p>
<p>在這個激動的大時代中、勇敢的、堅定的、有政治認識的固盟會不斷地前進、但是怯懦的動搖的所認識糢糊的、在這大時代的跟前、便悲觀失望、徬徨痛哭、喪失了戰鬥的勇氣、般民衆固不用說、在靑年羣里、也常常發現有這種時代的渣滓、他們悲觀、他的逃跑、他們地飯碗看作偶像、他們用臨死前的歡樂去麻醉自己、他們自　為　不上時什、要向下沉、是失敗主義者、這是抗戰在這　重要期中一件嚴重的問題、使抗戰力大量大耗損、</p>
<p>在勝利的基礎上增加新的力量，克服新的困難</p>
<p>總上以觀、這里得到這樣的結論、淡水已向新的途徑突進着、而在這條新途徑上、都有着什多困難在阻碍著、無疑的、不把目前的困難、用最大的努力去克服、新淡水是不能長大出來的、</p>
<p>（一）把武裝工作放在第一位</p>
<p>時局緊張、救亡工作者應該把武裝工作到在第一位、提出一切　着抗日、為着組織民眾武裝的口號、動員同志會會員參加武裝組織、並且在社訓隊的名義睛統一起來、實施嚴格的政治敎育和軍事訓練、</p>
<p>（二）鞏固與擴大區抗×同志會的組織</p>
<p>民衆抗×同志會現在雖然已有了一萬以上的會員、但是仍然不够的、區會沒有成立、鄉分會也還有許多剛在開始、區署應協助後援會把良秀的工作經驗保存並發揚起來、切切實實地鞏固及擴大下去、廣泛及深入地組織起來、</p>
<p>（三）加緊肅奸工作</p>
<p>擴大和鞏固後援會屬的懲奸委員會和各鄉抗×同志會的緝奸隊、公佈懲好條例、普遍地在各種羣衆會議中討肅奸問、淸理淡水偽治安維持會。</p>
<p>（四）加緊建立情報綱</p>
<p>除將會有電詁重新整理和增設外、各鄉同志會、更應加緊設立遞步哨和通訊隊、以及傳達各地的眞確情報。</p>
<p>（五）把區政和救運緊密地聯繫起來</p>
<p>區政工作和救亡工作、不但不能分開而且還要聯繁起來、因為政治和救運是同一的事情、政治的發展和救運的發展是應該配合起來的、說明白些、就是一切的救亡團體、小論抗×同志會、抗×後援會、華僑回鄕服務團、救護隊、社訓隊……應盡可能的協助區政的發展與機固、相同的、而區署也應購可能相互協助、</p>
<p>（六）实行大联合</p>
<p>政治新人及救亡工作者、急應改變過去的作法、積極爭取紳耆、名流、各階層各階級的人聯台、爭取他們指導工作、協助工作、在互助互讓的原則下、互相督促、互相鼓勵、平衡的發展起來、</p>
<p>（七）鞏固下層機構</p>
<p>區署方面應切實的鞏固各鄕保甲的組織、後援會應切實的鞏固各同志會的組織、使下層機構能眞確地實行政治和和救亡的一切任務在同一戰綫下、使行動統一呼應相通、</p>
<p>最後的幾句話</p>
<p>新淡水是在進步中的、但新淡水的面前橫着重重的困難、應該負責解决這些困難的、不只是救亡工作者、不只是區署人員叩是全淡水的民衆、而且只是救亡工作者和區署人員也勿論如何是解决不來！應該靠着全淡水民衆的力量、</p>
<p>我們在這裏謹對淡水的救亡工作者和區署人員的工作致敬、但更望他們不要在困難的面前屈服、要好好地為抗×民族統一戰線而鬥爭下去、幷且更望淡水的民衆大家仔這抗戰艱苦的難關中、為着淡水前途想想、為着民族前途想想、放棄狹隘觀念、放果成見、團結起來、『團結便是勝利』、</p>
<p>淡水是來江前綫、我把這新淡水的輪廓描寫起來、目的不只在使人明瞭她的姿態便了、我是在希望着新淡水能在進步的基礎上爭取勝利、希望熱心的同胞們能够特別注意她的進步、而睛帮助她的進步、</p>

<h3>上海電影觀眾的新傾向　影院經理所發表的談話</h3>
<p>最近上海大陸報為探知上海電影觀眾的愛好、厭惡、和一般的態度起見、遍訪各太電影院的經理、所獲得的消息、很可為讀者介紹一下、</p>
<p>男星最愛埃洛弗林</p>
<p>上海的電影觀衆、目前對於好萊塢的男星、最愛好的便是埃洛弗林、他所主演的『羅賓漢』和『鐵血主義』（Dawn　Patrol)都是寶座最盛的片子、繼埃洛弗林之後上海的電影觀衆表示愛好的是克拉克蓋博、泰羅飽華、和威廉鮑惠爾等、</p>
<p>女星最愛狄娜寶萍</p>
<p>好萊塢的女星、和埃洛弗林一樣、最受上海電影觀衆的歡迎者、是狄娜竇萍、亞洲影院公司曾印狄娜竇萍的照片一萬張、可是在三天之內、每張都被人要了去、</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒　亦稱不弱</p>
<p>近幾年來、好萊塢這所影城之中、都在預測秀蘭鄧波兒的降落問題、但就上海的電影觀衆說來、對於這位小明星、還是和以前一樣的歡迎、聽說有她所主演的影片上映、一定會滿座、所以有一家影院經理向人表示、秀蘭鄧波兒在上海的賣座、並沒有衰落、</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉仍受歡迎</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉、尤其是『絕代艷后』Marsa　Antoinette一片公映之後、格外受上海電影觀衆的愛戴、</p>
<p>白雪公主賣座最盛</p>
<p>另外好萊塢一般影片公司都用偉大的塲面、攝製壯麗的鉅片、而據一個影院經理說、近來一張影片、映期的長短、就看這一點、凡是塲面偉大、佈景壯麗的影片、映期一定會加長、在過去一年之中、上海的觀衆最歡迎的影片、要算『白雪公主』Snow　Whfte　and　the　Seven　Dwarfs、甚至在第二輪影院放映、每日泱五場、而每埸擠滿觀衆、被擯門外者、仍大不乏人、其次排在「白雪公主一的後面、便是『羅賓漢』、以製片者的獲利說來、後者實際上更超過前者、</p>
<p>中國影片新的趨向</p>
<p>關於中國影片、一位經理指出歷史片的風行、也有報理由、在現在的緊張情狀下、祗有這種典型的影片、才可不受阻礙、此較上目前的影片、不大受檢查、主要的原因、就在製片者所抱的態度、以為一部影片、如果檢查時遭遇障礙、便賺不到錢、因此、他們不再製作要被檢查掉的影片、大多數被檢查掉的影片、是怕在上海遭複雜的城市中、公映之時、有傷「若干邦國』的情感、</p>
<p>卓別麟的新片問題</p>
<p>最後談到卓別麟的新片問題、各影院經理都不能預言這部影片將來是否能在上海公映、但是他們都肯定的表示、卓別麟一向是為中國觀衆所歡迎的、卓氏的影片、和勞萊哈台合演的影片、每是可得到很好的賣座、至於勞萊哈台的拆夥問題、有一個經理以為拆夥之後、勞萊應得加入卓別麟的班子、他們同樣是笑匠、應當在一起合作、卓別麟的新片、將第一次銀幕上開口、他以前所以避免開口、是以為他的言語、說得太斯文、不配他的手杖、但現在、他在描寫獨裁者的影片中、可以操『受過敎育」者的言語、自然比較適合了。</p>
<h3>滬郊遊擊區公演　抗戰游藝</h3>
<p>國軍西撤後、滬郊各縣、如上海、南匯、奉賢、川沙寶山、嘉定、松江等處重要點綫、雖相繼淪陷於×軍鐵蹄之下、然大部政權、仍在我流動部隊控制中、據聞滬郊遊擊隊、除不時以聲東擊西的方法襲擊日軍據點外、更為增加游擊區內民衆抗戰情緒、抗戰精神計、特由政治訓練部着手組織抗戰流動劇團、表演抗日話劇、該團由李君担任主任、劇員都係遴選愛好藝術的靑年志士、其處女劇『和平之賊』、已編製完成、現正積極訓練、卽將輪流分赴各鄕鎮公演、</p>
<h3>銀花</h3>
<p>— 云</p>
<p>好萊塢跳舞指導李洛拍里齊（Le　Roy　Prfnz）、他一生的工作、就是挑選相訓練女子上鏡頭、他說、『你要想知道一個女子的身份和性格、不必帶她去找星相家、也不必找手相家、只要看她的腿、就能斷定了、若是、一個女子有長的膝骨、她一定非但是多情、體貼、並且也是忠誠可靠的、就是在定路方面、也能看出女子的性格、聰明練達的女子、走路時腿提得很高、具有自信心和大胆的女子、走路時、必有一付無拘無朿的態度、忸怩的女子、走路時、很胆小的跨着不穩定的步子、輕浮、懈惰的女子、定路常踏着參差不齊、忽長忽短的步伐、有堅硬腿膝的女子、一定也有堅强的性格、這是我的經驗之談、你們不信、不妨試試』、</p>
<p>奧應薇哈佛蘭和瓊芳泰（Joan　Fontaine）、別看她倆臉蛋兒有點相像、她們是嫡親姊妹呢、可是她倆永遠分道揚鏢、從不同路出遊、交友也是分開着、各交各的朋友、幷且在瓊拍第一張片子所簽的合同上面、就有一條是、永遠不能說出奧麗薇是她的姊姊、雖說、她倆也許為了性格不同、所以意見相左、可是、竟至不認姊妹、未免有點太過份了吧、</p>
<p>在瓊克勞馥和佛蘭支通的離婚成了事實之後的好萊塢、幾乎鬧得滿城風雨、都在談論着瓖和李却考羅惠（Richard　Cromwell）的羅曼史、李却、在好萊塢也算得上是個風流　儻的靑年、他和瓊認識已差不多十年工夫了、他也曾到瓊和小范朋克的家中去做過客、以後、也和佛蘭支通交過朋友、他的確對於瓊夢有極大的愛羡之心、新近、他還塑了一個瓊的面型、供養在家裏、瓊呢、她作承認李却是位漂亮、能幹不可多得的男子、所以、據一般人的觀祭、他倆若是有越乎友誼之上的感情發生、幷不是意料之外的事呢、</p>
<p>一天晚上、勞勃脫楊的鄰居、看見有一個人在設法要　開勞勃脫楊的家門、他們知道、那上晚上、勞勃脫楊不在家、他的僕人又正在休假期、無疑的、這深夜、門的必是個『賊』、勞勃脫楊、平日為人旣是十分和氣、現在眼見他家中即將被竊、那有不帮忙之理、於是、立刻報吿警察、一時警笛狂嗚、警察到了不少、用電光四處亂照、果然、那『賊』又正攀在廚房的窗口、想望裏跳、警察們、一湧而上、捉住了他、他却開口了、『若是一個人在出門時忘了帶鑰匙、他難道不能想法子進他自已的屋子去麽、』不用說了、勞勃脫楊又在表演他一貫的荒唐作風、可是這麽一人羣的人、是他白忙了半夜、究竟也有點兒不過意、只好把他們都邀進屋子裏、款待了一些茶水、略表謝忱</p>

<h3>下週末麗華杯決賽　西文員陣線決定　希望華聯盡選精銳與之周旋</h3>
<p>（本報訊）我們還紀得、二月十八日在香港會場舉行那幕麗華杯足球初賽、當時因南華征貢禾歸、華聯隊的人選問題、頗費躊躇、幸得李惠　不惜舉足之勞、願為効力、領導一班少壯派、出與海軍聯隊周旋、因全體將士、用命疆場、卒以四對一的大比數、把海軍淘汰出局、獲得决寥權、</p>
<p>另一方面的西文員聯隊、則把陸軍聯隊擊敗、也獲得決賽欄、　於决賽日期、原定四月二日、適其時星洲中華隊來港比賽、所以此幕爭標戰、提前三月廿六日（星期日）舉行、</p>
<p>現在戰期已近、負責選拔西文員隊的總會、昨已將球員選出、雖整個陳線、非十分完整、然實力尙覺不弱、前線有吿山　、中防有準利士、都是久歷戎行的人物、希望華聯方面、盡選精銳上陣、更不妨再　患堂參戰、蓋他在前次旣建下大功、則此可决賽、可復舉他為隊畏、到時如戰騰而奪標、他自然樂得親身接受獎品的光榮、但未悉他願意再為効力否、（東郞）</p>
<p>西文員聯隊</p>
<p>高路斯（香港會）</p>
<p>烏烈芝（九龍會）　帕架（警察會）</p>

<h3>今天重要足球賽　南南東方戰勁旅　勝負問題關係錦標至大</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）甲組足球聯賽的錦標賬、自上祗欠『逢二進一』的最後一算、究竞屬諸南　南的抑或落在海軍之手、　本月底、包管有事實可見、但般球迷欲知後出如如　、請毋忽視了今天幾　關係　要的比賽、</p>
<p>今天一般球迷的目光、當然重視南南對警察及東方　　軍兩役、但分途應和、濟地　術、意欲何往、但從尊便、</p>
<p>組四役中、以實力强弱而談負、南　應　警察、東方與海軍　劇戰、勝負問題未可預料、米　息必敗聖約　、南華　與九龍會則有激烈的爭持、</p>
<p>有一點堪注意的、則是半場題、今大三　隊乃為客軍、　　人的球埸比賽、此種地利關係、有。會演出意外的結少、希望三華隊各自努力、克制瓊境、則滕利自負了、</p>
<p>南南為奪標希望所驅使、决以原班人馬上陣、足傷戶愈的劉慶才、可以　出、故整個實力為雄厚、警　方面、陣綫將有更動、調　架打內街、而以名兒很陌生、哥頓打中略、　將來、察終非南南敵手、兩隊如下、</p>

<p>畢烈頓　哥頓　那夫</p>
<p>磨士　花利亞　范貴才　屈士　黃文貴</p>
<p>東方的亞軍希望、增已不絕如縷、必須今天戰勝海軍及以後各役全勝、才爭一個與海軍相等的地位、如冉有一失、便攀不上第二了、聽說東方的侯澄滔及宋靈聖、足協休息、將不參戰、若此、實未許樂觀、宰而海車人材已不比前佳、東方各員如一心一德、或可奪得兩分、東方陣　如下、</p>

<p>羅偉權　曾仲云　劉始讚</p>
<p>於洽興　許竟成　李德奇　吳祺祥　陳炳土</p>
<p>南華華對九龍會一役、因在九龍會場舉行、地利問題、比其他一切更重要、九龍會每在主場作戰、從未失敗過、故今天南華欲勝實難、或者各員演出、有如戰勝海軍時的作風、則尙有可為、努力吧、最好能够打破九龍會主場不敗的紀錄、兩陣如下、（太歲）</p>

<h3>也來談談兒童體育（二）</h3>
<p>— 雛法魯</p>
<p>再次就是唱歌遊戲、普通即是用來幼稚圍的敎材、它的編　、人都墨守陳法、唱歌多而動　　、　動作又大多是呆板　　、分量興味都不够、不足以　兒童身心的　求、　　事實吿訴我們、能够採用這種　料的、一定是規模較大的　　、至於現模較小的學校、不是把這些軟　的　　納人較大的兒童一起、　他們礦大兒常所做的材料、是所之缺如、</p>
<p>這種與原的造成、最大原因、就是大家看了體育太容易、不肯虛心的加以研究、其次就是小學體育敎師、沒有文過專業的訓練、根本不知道什麼叫作敎授方法、什麽叫作適宣材料、要加他去做不是能力所能做的事情、何異痴人說夢、</p>
<p>體育的範圍、不單是直接有影響兒尊體格的運動、加接有影響的衞生事項、也在具內、運動與衛生、實在互為衣夢、息息相關的、講求　軍體育訓練的、要是單注意運動　　略了衞生、一方面鍛練、一方面　後、那麽　動所得的效果、一定抵償不了不衞讓的禍害、這是顯而易見的事實、不必多所詞費、我國對於兒童的體育訓練、直接的運動、是如此、間接的衛生、那是東不必談了、</p>
<p>前面說過、兒童除了動和睡而外、吃也是三部曲中間之一、尢其是在嬰孩的時期、食欲更覺旺盛、我們試看他　便拿到一樣什麽東西、不論他是吃不好吃、能吃不能吃、都是一律有嘴裏送、就是明證、但是因為他們的知力薄露、缺一判斷力、所以不知　麽節制、只要行吃、　　是不　一切的吃、他肖的容量較得下不下、他消化的能力吃得了吃不了、都不暇顧及、兒童所以如此無限的亂吃、是因為他們無知、做父母的是有知的、應當指導他們節制、但是也往是不顧一切、一聽到兒童吃、就立刻給他吃、甚至於兒重的哭、並不是要吃、也給他吃、要知道兒童的胃不是無底的、俏化力不是無限的、時時無限制的給他吃、胃容不下、只有加緊消化、消化不了的、只有　緊驅出肛門。結果必致消化器只用過　而疲癆、而衰竭、終致吃　去的是什麽排出來的仍舊是什麼、不能變作養料來滋會泉體、這樣吃和不吃一　、同時　以使　養不良、後天失調、　（未完）</p>

<h3>想到什麼說什麼</h3>
<p>— 魏飛</p>
<p>夜間無事，呆坐椅上胡想：「人如果到了不知羞恥的時候，實在是己經沒有了人性」。忽然，來了一陣吠聲，非常奇特，好像很悲哀的樣子。把我的思想也轉移到記起世上有些很奇特少有，而且頗聰明的「狗」。</p>
<p>有些為食的狗，只要有人曾給它東西吃，或養它，便會在人的跟前搖兩下尾巴，跳幾跳，亂嗅一頓人的脚，或者做着種種姿勢來討人歡喜，也許還會替人做點事，守守門口；遇着生人俱吠或者咬，要是多給它點東西吃，養得好，便會做主人的侍從，隨主人在街上走，有時主人需要它做事時，便指使它去做，因為他是沒有人性的，是狗，人們便不會責怪它，說他卑鄙，賤格，也許還會微微地用鼻孔一笑；而它自己呢？亦不覺得卑鄙，賤格，也不理會到（或者不怕）人們的笑，且覺得自已很盡忠盡力服務着主人，非常偉大，忠心，能幹，時常搖搖擺擺的走着，然而，它也頗聰明，雖然明知自己是這麽得力，能幹，但却總不很　離主人的脚跟一步，因為它感到一離開時，便好像一個嬰孩失却了保護它的媽媽一樣，雖然它是這樣愛惜自己的生命，相有時因為同伴分食不淸時，他便會不顧生命的，互相亂吠或者亂咬，這就是他們的特性。</p>
<p>又有一些狗，比較是不十分為食，但是為了盡忠于主人，在主人講話或將要講話時，便附和或預早的吠幾聲，但所不幸，人們聽得不耐煩了，便聯合趕走它。連小孩子也覺起「死狗」來，本來它總可走向主人的跟前，但恰巧主人也失意了，他感到很沒趣，也許主人再無力理它了，便悄悄地溜到別的地方去，雖然中間還有發　微弱而悲哀的吠聲，但已　無人理它了，因為主人失意事小，自己被趕事大，愈加沒趣。為自己體面計，主人計，就任何方面計，都有設法挽囘這危局的必要，第一先要捧捧自己，不要再給人趕或為得這麽厲害，第二為迷惑一班意志未决徘徊十字路口的，再進一步拉囘一班意志相投而忠心服役主人的和收買一班只希望多得點東西吃的，雖然也有了這個必要或計劃，它們自己去辦是太不妥當的，于時一班負了使命的小狗便到各處去混或吠，口頭上吠當然收效微乎其微，要收效大，宣傳廣，逃不脫在報紙刊物鼓吹，但是，在被趕的地方吹是不可能的，在主人的地方吹却沒多大用，只有在兩者之間的地方，這裏有很多他的×人，且那些×人是無能力趕他的權的，罵或者笑，他又却「不理會到（或者不怕）」，那麽，便在一份什麼日報，什麼週報和兩份誨淫的小報上大吹大擂。</p>
<p>或者狗總是狗，擂起來的聲音確難人耳，也許就因此便閱者不多起來，自己漸覺無味，但是不吠又不是，無聊起來只有亂吠一場，或者故意顚倒人家的是非，含血噴人……總之是自已做了落水狗，也想一起拉人下水。</p>
<p>大槪越是亂吠，越是聽者少而打者多，　後必至衆人喊打的一天。</p>
<h3>湖上</h3>
<p>— 彭成慧</p>
<p>是一片白茫茫的，萬傾的銀湖，岸邊全長着濃密的蘆葦，成羣的水鷗，不時豁刺刺地從中飛起。對岸山邊，琉疏落落的住着許多人家，炊煙裊裊地此時正從家家戶戶地煙突上升起，一縷一進的深入雲際。</p>
<p>上升的陽光，很耀眼的照射着、　彷彿古代「梁山泊」似的境地。過和的晨風，輕輕地　着。　面上不時波動著萬千的漣漪，湖山色，在這明媚晨光中，正儘量　演着她們偉大的，自然的美麗。</p>
<p>此時我跟梅正站在湖邊的一角，欣賞着這美麗的水色山光。我們遙望着天上朝霞的變幻，俯視着微波的蕩漾：我們看得呆了，彷彿是踏淮了一個帶有詩意的夢鄕。</p>
<p>忽然，離我們約百碼之遙的蘆華裏面，一葉扁舟溜出來了。上面紙有一個重獨搖槳的女郞。槳聲一起一落，很有節拍似的，舟身也就跟着槳聲箭一般的向　邊駛去了。摻着便傅來一片嬌媚的歌聲，打破了這沉寂的的空氣：</p>
<p>朝日升，曉風凉，</p>
<p>阿總行槳去，</p>
<p>去會我　郞，</p>
<p>官廳軍書　　下，</p>
<p>征送我郞上戰場—</p>
<p>我郞有　報國家。</p>
<p>聽到消息　喜像瘋狂。</p>
<p>從此有機擎槍殺倭寇，</p>
<p>不負男兒壯士好時光。</p>
<p>我郞該知道，</p>
<p>倭寇多殘暴，</p>
<p>國土年年玻侵佔，</p>
<p>城池日日被焚燒，</p>
<p>民房被毀何止千萬間？</p>
<p>性命被殺何止千萬條？</p>
<p>此仇今日不報何時報？</p>
<p>此恨今日不消何時消？</p>
<p>郞呀！握緊槍，向前跑</p>
<p>渴飮倭奴血，</p>
<p>飢吃倭奴奇！</p>
<p>我郞　謹記，</p>
<p>上陣莫遲疑，</p>
<p>震巢之下無完卵，</p>
<p>男兒　國止當時，</p>
<p>國破家亡無寧日，</p>
<p>只有生生，世做奴隸，</p>
<p>郞呀，勇敢前進吧。</p>
<p>莫向阿儂依依嘆別離！</p>
<p>朝日升，曉風凉，</p>
<p>阿儂打槳去，</p>
<p>送別我情郎，</p>
<p>奉幼我郞勇敢向前去，</p>
<p>握緊槍桿上戰場，</p>
<p>殺盡×人方罷手、</p>
<p>收復河山把國揚，</p>
<p>郞呀，勇敢前進吧，</p>
<p>莫向阿儂喋喋應家鄕。</p>
<p>舟身漸漸遠了，歌聲也漸漸的低微下去了，最後，舟影歌聲，終于在湖先山色中消失下去。</p>
<p>『你該學她的樣呢』！我笑着對　說。</p>
<p>「你也得有他那樣的勇氣呀」！她撒嬌地答。</p>
<p>我們相對着笑了。存我們回來的時候，我們彼此的心中，都蘊藏着最後勝利的信念。</p>
<h3>晨歌</h3>
<p>— 林玲</p>
<p>黎明吞去了黑夜，</p>
<p>陽光消融了沉鬱：</p>
<p>敎堂裏播出嘹喨的鐘聲，</p>
<p>把睡心中的都中奐醒。</p>
<p>霧　籠　着　巒，</p>
<p>伸出半空的十字架，</p>
<p>在虔誠地跪對　聖主</p>
<p>作和乎的晨禱。</p>
<p>小鳥迴躍在枝頭，</p>
<p>高唱黎明的頌歌。</p>
<p>但那還　的霧靄，</p>
<p>為何障阻了光明普照？</p>
<p>去吧，霧霾！</p>
<p>我要光明！</p>
<h3>「燒冷竃」與「打落水狗」</h3>
<p>— 莫邪</p>
<p>一樣是失意的人，有的被人當為「冷竃」。不時「燒」之，有的被人當為「務水狗」。羣起「打」之，正可謂有幸有不幸了。</p>
<p>「竈」就是「狗」「狗」就是「竈」二而一，一而二，「燒」者「打」者，究竞有無法眼，加以鑑別，我不得而知。不過有一點我却是知道的，就是「燒」者也會一打」，「打」者也會「燒」，二者可兼，正像「吹」奢善「拍」，音「拍」者善「吹」，那樣來得渾成。</p>
<p>一般人總以燒冷竈是陰功積德，雖然不見得一定會如韓信那樣的冷竈，有千金之報，究竟幫助失意的可憐人，這是一件美事，只有打落水狗，眞所謂落阱下石，不足為訓，凡是稍存仁心，略以慈善為懷的，總不該有此一舉。於是社會的看法，雖將「竈」與一狗一列於同等地位，却將「燒」者和「打」者，變作了兩等人，予以另眼看待；善「燒」者有慈善家之美名，善「打」者乃多刻薄鬼之惡謚。</p>
<p>然而在我仔細想來，「竈」亦有不應「燒」而「狗」亦有不能不「打」者。恐怕說來太抽象，難於明白，不妨舉例以明之。</p>
<p>「黨紀先生」一　而為『三不主義者』，蟄居　內，本身又成了這樣的『竈』或『狗』。——所謂又成了，是因為他已經幾次三番榮任這樣　『竈』或『狗』過，——使有人去『燒』他豈不是增長他的惡勢力？作算，你去『燒』了，他因而『旺』起來，將來算還你的「薪」價是很可觀的，可是一朝勢成燎原，爆裂起來，　如天下蒼生何！這樣的『冷騷』，我以為不應規，應讓它淸水蓋了鍋明，冷塌冷塌，方是上上大吉。</p>
<p>援『寵』就是「狗」的前提，他現在也正是落在「河內」之『狗』。據傳，他並不見得死心塌地，以水為家，頗有爬上岸來之意。而他的「爪牙」，的確也在活動，想要促成他的「上岸」運動。他一上岸來，誰也保得定他不成為「瘋狗」，為害人羣呢？那麽，現在他還在「河內」，沒有上岸，此時不打。更待何時！</p>
<p>因此燒一冷火山」般的冷竈，算不得做好事，正是做壞事；同樣，打「瘋狗」般的落水狗，算不得做壞事，正是做好事。今之「燒者」「打者」，還須三思之。</p>
<p>所謂『燒』『打』得兼，也有一個道理在內。蓋二者的目的，大都未必出於利他，而出於利已。他想被燒者一朝飛黃騰達，他就可以得到奧援，而被打的，當然是與他有妨礙的人，一打而使之不起，他從此可以高枕無憂了。所以這樣的人，旣會一燒」也會「打」。</p>
<p>同樣，出於正義感的「燒」與「打」，使好人發旺而壞人落水，也有相反相成之妙，可以「燒」與「打」，是可以萃於一身的。</p>
<p>「也許有人要問問我個人對於這事的態度，則我可以說，我很羡慕「不因人熱」的梁伯鸞，「熱竈」，還不要燒，「冷竈」云乎哉！我也很羡慕除三害的周孝侯，大丈夫射南山虎，斬長播蛟耳，「落水狗」云乎哉！</p>

<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>她仍起勁地說翁：『先生，我吿訴你，我有點好處——就是聽說，你要我打狗，我不罵鷄，你要　我殺鷄呀，我一定把　殺得乾乾凈凈，你吃的時候，二定找不到一根毛。你不相信嗎？』</p>
<p>『我相信，相信。將來我要殺鷄，我一定請你：可是，現在我要你請小姐』</p>
<p>『是的我去找小姐。我的話說太多了，先生，不以為太多嗎？』</p>
<p>『還不多。』</p>
<p>『先生，那我們下次再談，』</p>
<p>他幾乎顫抖了，他想：</p>
<p>『你　了我吧，我並得有犯罪！』</p>
<p>那僕去後，他盼等的那個來了。他躲到門旁、用一隻手偷偷地握住了門的把手，徵笑地望着來　——　年靑的姑娘。她的美麗的臉型比她的照片美麗得更多；她不需要胭脂，她的臉頰，便是胭脂的　色；在眉間嫩白的皮膚上有一粒黑珠一般的小痣，比愛美的蕩婦時時用墨描畫的還黑；被一滴聖水所襯托的眸子，銳敏而靈活。　靈活，可以牽動男人已定的心願；總之，她的臉，有着宇宙一切象形的　——典型的美。她穿了一身淡靑的絲質的襯衣，綉有玫瑰色和雪色兩　　小花；前者如果可以象徵着她的美麗，後者便可以代表此心的顏色；雖然，她的父親，是一個祖國的叛徒。她看見那陌生者的時候，也並不驚慌；一邊放下手　的琴譜，一邊說着：</p>
<p>『誰呀？到屋里，還不脫掉大衣，眞是，還戴着皮帽子呢！』她走近那陌生者些，又問：『把皮帽子拿下來，讓我看着是誰呀？』</p>
<p>她看有對方呆呆地站在門旁，沒有一絲的回　，她史加感到有些陌生了。隨着着，她的問話，也變了陌生的語：</p>
<p>『找誰？』</p>
<p>『找你！』</p>
<p>『我不認識你呀！』</p>
<p>『可是，我認識你，你是朱琳！』</p>
<p>這時候，她有些疑慮了，雄道　上有不曾相見而相識的人嗎？因此，她匆匆地走近他的身邊去，她想重重新認識一下他的臉孔：她一面搜索着自己的回憶，一面望他思想地說着：</p>
<p>『你究竟是誰呢？』　（十）</p>

<h3>War of Resistance, Nation-Building, and Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>One of the crucial conditions for the final victory and success of the great undertaking of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building is the implementation of democratic politics under centralized leadership, thereby strengthening the connection between the government and the people and maximizing the capabilities of the anti-Japanese regime. This was declared in the manifesto of the Kuomintang's Provisional National Congress, explicitly stipulated in the Outline for the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, and subsequently elaborated and encouraged throughout the nation by the supreme leader based on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. The establishment of the National Political Council was precisely based on the needs of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, opening an unprecedented glorious page in China's history of civil governance.</p>
<p>Democracy is, in essence, equality. In this worldwide struggle against fascism and aggression, what is sought is world peace and democracy. The governments or peoples of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France are fighting to defend democracy and peace, making the defense of democratic politics the primary task at hand. The reason our country is suffering so much from the bombardment of artillery fire and the trampling of iron hooves today is entirely due to the aggression of the Japanese fascists. Therefore, our country's War of Resistance for national independence and freedom is also a global struggle against fascism and aggression, and at the same time, a righteous war to defend democracy and peace. Our country's united War of Resistance is inextricably linked to the global struggle against fascist aggression, demonstrating the necessity of developing democratic politics in China today in terms of international significance.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is something else we cannot ignore: if we want to achieve the final victory and success of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, we must mobilize all the people of the entire Chinese nation. This is a fact known to all and is also the current urgent task of the central authorities and various parties striving to realize it. But how can we concentrate the dynamic forces of the entire nation on the cause of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building? The recent General Mobilization of National Spiritual Strength is one of the main methods, and the realization of democratic politics during the War of Resistance, in order to promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, to stimulate the people's initiative, creativity, and enthusiasm, and to dedicate all their strength to serve the cause of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, is the most urgent task at hand. Furthermore, the gradual realization of wartime democratic politics and the resulting appropriate improvement of all political institutions will lay the foundation for the future construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, and its great significance for the establishment of new anti-Japanese people's regimes in the occupied areas is even more evident. This demonstrates the necessity of developing democratic politics in China today in terms of domestic significance.</p>
<p>As China's full-scale War of Resistance enters its second stage, based on the experience and lessons learned from twenty months of heroic and bloody battles, and in response to the recent developments and trends in the international situation, promoting the wartime democratic political movement has become the most pressing task for the entire nation. The great achievements of the three sessions of the National Political Council have made the entire nation feel the urgent need to promote democratic politics and serve the War of Resistance and Nation-Building movement, as well as its optimistic prospects, and the rapid establishment of local representative bodies has become a unanimous demand of the country. The government has therefore made a decision to establish provincial, municipal, and county councils by April 1st. We express our infinite congratulations and expectations on behalf of the people of the country for the government's appropriate decision based on the domestic and international situation and the urgent needs of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building. Based on our humble opinion, we hope that the provincial, municipal, and county councils will consider the following points:</p>
<p>As the War of Resistance moves towards a new stage, China is gradually forming a balanced stalemate. The key to our country's ability to overcome and achieve results lies in the mobilization of national strength, and the mobilization of national strength begins with the progress of local politics and the development of democratic forces. This is the first reason why the provincial, municipal, and county councils must be convened as soon as possible and universally. The National Political Council is the only representative body that has emerged to meet the new needs of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building. For more than a year, it has made great contributions to strengthening the connection between the government and the people, laying and consolidating the foundation of civil governance, and assisting in the great undertakings of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building. This is the second reason why the provincial, municipal, and county councils must also promote this spirit of the National Political Council. Our country's War of Resistance and Nation-Building today is to strive for independence, freedom, and happiness for the entire Chinese nation, and to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People with equal international, political, and economic status. It can be said to be a struggle to realize democratic politics. In this struggle, the concentration of popular strength is a major prerequisite, and the development of public opinion is an even more important prerequisite for concentrating popular strength. This is the third reason why the provincial and municipal councils must become de facto local representative bodies. Although everyone knows the importance of developing public opinion and concentrating popular strength, relying solely on the government's top-down advocacy seems insufficient to meet the needs of the current situation. Therefore, the provincial, municipal, and county councils especially rely on the assistance of all ethnic groups and parties in the country, the government, and the enthusiastic participation of people from all walks of life. This is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>The international struggle situation is now extremely dangerous, and the success of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building is still far away. All our compatriots who seek to save the world, the country, and themselves should strive forward and dedicate their efforts! This is the sincere hope we extend to all provincial, municipal, and county councils.</p>
<h3>Today! East and West Two Glorious and Heroic Festivals</h3>
<p>Commemorating the Beijing Massacre and the Paris Commune</p>
<p>March is a season of passionate and great revolutions.</p>
<p>March 18th is an even greater festival for the people's revolution in the East and the West.</p>
<p>In the East, in Beiping (then called Beijing) in our China, thirteen years ago today, the "Tiananmen Great Massacre" occurred.</p>
<p>In the West, in France, sixty-seven years ago today (1871), the "Paris Commune," the first revolutionary regime of the working masses in history, was established.</p>
<p>Whether it is the "Tiananmen Massacre" in the East or the "Paris Commune" in the West, the glorious and heroic historical traces they left behind are of great significance to the Chinese compatriots who are fighting for national freedom and happiness, and to the anti-fascist and anti-aggression warriors of all countries who are fighting for world peace and justice. Moreover, this leaves us with very profound lessons.</p>
<p>(I) The East's [March 18th]</p>
<p>March, this extraordinary month most worthy of commemoration in the history of mankind's struggle for freedom, thirteen years ago (1916) today (March 18th), Beijing students and the masses held a National Assembly, opposing the Japanese army's bombardment of the Dagu Forts and the Eight-Nation Alliance's ultimatum to our country, held a demonstration, and petitioned Duan Qirui's government. Unexpectedly, as soon as the crowd arrived in front of the Executive Yuan, they were shot at by the guards, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. From that day on, the northern masses issued revolutionary roars, responding to our southern revolutionary actions, and laying the foundation for the success of the Northern Expedition.</p>
<p>(I) The Political Background of the Beijing Massacre</p>
<p>After the "May Thirtieth Movement" in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), Japanese × imperialism intensified its steps in invading China, especially suppressing our people's revolutionary movement, not hesitating to take direct action. At that time, the Feng Clique warlords completely suppressed the people's anti-× and anti-feudal movements under the instructions of ××ism, while the broad masses also widely launched movements against the Feng Clique warlords. The Zhili-Feng War broke out, and Sun Chuanfang, Wu Peifu, and others took advantage of the people, especially the students', anti-Feng upsurge to quickly defeat the Feng army in Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou. Under the leadership of Zhang Zuolin, the Feng army sent Zhang Xueliang and Yu Songling to enter the pass to assist in the battle. However, under the development of the revolutionary movement, some military personnel were also affected, and on October 1, 1925 (the fourteenth year of the Republic of China), Guo Songling inclined towards revolution, staged a mutiny in Luanzhou, led his army out of the pass, occupied Jinzhou with irresistible force, and advanced towards Shenyang. Japanese ××ism directly helped its tool, the Feng Clique warlords, send 2,500 troops to occupy the Fengtian Arsenal and the powder magazine, using Japanese troops disguised as Feng troops to directly attack Guo Songling's army, and also used 80 aircraft to bomb Guo's army. Guo's army was finally defeated miserably on December 25, and Guo was also captured and murdered.</p>
<p>After Japanese ××ism dispatched troops to Manchuria and defeated Guo Songling's army, which had anti-Japanese and revolutionary tendencies, it further called for the alliance of Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu, and assisted Wu with huge sums of money, and supplied Zhang Zongchang and others with military weapons, bullets, and military personnel, attempting to fundamentally eliminate the National Army, which was close to the people's revolution. When the First National Army repeatedly defeated the Zhili-Shandong Allied Army, the Japanese ×× fleet suddenly bombarded the Dagu Forts, colluding with the Feng fleet to seize Tianjin, in order to support Zhang Zongchang and Li Jinglin, and used the ultimatum of the Eight-Nation Alliance to carry out intimidation.</p>
<p>At this time, the broad masses of our country, with male and female students as the vanguard, bravely and resolutely carried out a united resistance and counterattack against ××ists. We opposed the Japanese army's invasion of the three northeastern provinces and the alliance of the Feng-Zhili warlords, and our voices opposing Zhang and Wu's demonstrations and urging the National Government to launch the Northern Expedition spread throughout the country. Thus, the struggle between revolutionary and reactionary forces unfolded widely and cruelly, and the great massacre at Da'anmen in Beijing occurred at this time.</p>
<p>(II) The Course of the Beijing Massacre</p>
<p>At that time in Beijing, ever since the "May Thirtieth Movement" occurred, the emotions of revolutionary and reactionary forces' struggle surged higher and higher every day. The students and citizens there had repeatedly clashed with local military police in bloody incidents to commemorate "May Seventh," to oppose the Customs Conference, and to implement the revolution in the capital. On March 18, 1926, tens of thousands of students, workers, and citizens in Beijing gathered, vehemently opposing the Japanese warship bombardment of Dagu, opposing the ministers'团's "ultimatum," and held a National Assembly at Tiananmen. After the meeting, they held a demonstration. They shouted slogans such as "Down with ××ism," "×× Japanese ××ism," "Down with the traitor Duan ××," and "Expel the ministers of the Eight Nations." They also petitioned the State Council of Duan Qirui's government. However, Duan ××, Zhang ×, and ××, the leaders of the traitorous government at the time, hated the people's movement to save themselves and the country. In order to carry out a 50 million loan, they executed the instructions of the ministers'团 of the Eight Nations, especially Japanese ××, and ordered the shooting of the masses—under the fire of more than ten minutes, 26 people died on the spot, more than 200 were seriously injured, and more than 2,000 died in hospitals due to injuries. This was the tragic historical event of the "March 18th" massacre in which Japanese ××ism suppressed the people's revolutionary movement through the traitorous government of Duan ××. From then on, under the instructions of ××ism and the joint attack of the Feng-Zhili armies, the National Army was forced to retreat to Inner Mongolia and the Northwest, and the revolutionary movement in the North temporarily showed a considerable state of decline. Zhang and Wu met in Beijing, the reactionary forces became rampant again, actively attacked the people's revolutionary forces, and actively created darkness and terror. Under the leadership of ××ism, especially Japanese ××ism, these reactionary elements organized the "Anti-Red League," etc., to carry out so-called "anti-communist" work, using the names of "anti-red" and "anti-communist" to carry out counter-revolutionary and traitorous activities.</p>
<p>(III) The Experience and Lessons of the Beijing Massacre</p>
<p>From the facts of the "March 18th" Beijing Massacre, it can be known that although it was the traitorous and calamitous government in power at the time that directly shot and killed the masses, it was ××ism, especially Japanese ××, that caused and promoted this incident. It tried its best to help the reactionary forces, came forward to attack the revolutionary forces at the time, and promoted the so-called government in power at the time to massacre the people, carrying out the poisonous strategy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." Therefore, we should pay more attention to the fact that: First, Japanese ×× is still using old and new, overt and covert, executioners of the masses to organize puppet governments and traitor governments. The key figures in all traitor governments today were either openly or secretly accomplices in the slaughter of the Chinese people by the Japanese ××ists during the "March 18th" incident. Our war of resistance today is not only settling the blood debts since the "September 18th" or "July 7th" incidents, but also settling the blood debts accumulated in history. We must move forward today, following the blood path of the martyrs of "March 18th," and we must also be able to accomplish their unfulfilled ambitions!</p>
<p>Second, although the people's revolutionary movement at the time of "March 18th" was so loyal, brave, and heroic, it was ultimately because the united front on the revolutionary side was not united firmly and organized strictly. On the one hand, it failed to mobilize workers, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie more widely, and failed to win over friendly forces from the governments and military police of the reactionary warlords; on the other hand, the revolutionary center was still in the South at that time, and the revolutionary struggles of the people in the North and the South had not yet achieved close connection. These painful experiences should teach us that, as the War of Resistance turns to its second stage, we must strengthen the consolidation of national unity, expand the national united front, develop the leading political party of the War of Resistance of all ethnic groups, and at the same time pay attention to winning more friendly forces internationally and even in the × camp!</p>
<p>Third, at the time of "March 18th," the × people's united front occupied a considerable advantage. Japanese ××ism, on the one hand, used our country's reactionary forces and traitor government, and on the other hand, also allied with ××ist powers, such as the Eight-Nation Alliance issuing an ultimatum to us. Today, as the War of Resistance turns to its second stage and the difficulties of the × people are becoming more and more serious, the × people will certainly not relax the implementation of their consistent conspiracies. Therefore, we should pay more attention today to: (1) Pointing out the serious situation of the joint attack on China and the promotion of the world war by the three aggressive countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy. (2) Pointing out the conspiracy of the Japanese, German, and Italian aggressive groups to attack democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, and calling on democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, France, and the United States to strengthen the union of the Soviet Union to aid China and all invaded ethnic groups in order to protect their legitimate rights, status, and world peace. (3) Exposing the Japanese ××'s intensification of the use of Han traitors and accomplices who have overtly or covertly massacred the people in the past, using the slogans of "anti-communism" and "peace" in an attempt to alienate our unity, undermine our war of resistance, and achieve their conspiracy to quickly conquer China. We must also intensify the elimination of all remarks and actions that openly and latently violate the propositions of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, such as "anti-communism," "pro-peace," "repudiation of Europe and the United States," and the "one-day Manchuria-Mongolia group."</p>
<p>(II) The West's [March 18th]</p>
<p>Sixty-seven years ago today, March 18, 1871, the glorious and great anniversary of the establishment of the "Paris Commune" by the working people of France, is of great significance not only to human beings seeking freedom in all countries of the world, but also to our compatriots who are bravely resisting the war.</p>
<p>(I) The Success and Failure of the [Paris Commune]</p>
<p>In 1870, in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor of Germany, defeated France, and the French Emperor Napoleon III was captured. The Prussian King ascended the throne of Greater Germany in the Palace of Versailles outside Paris.</p>
<p>Because the French bourgeois government could not resist the irresistible attack of the enemy army, and feared that continuing the war of resistance would lead to victory that "must be obtained by the domestic revolutionary workers, peasants, and petty bourgeois masses," based on this erroneous estimate, it signed a treaty of national betrayal and humiliation with Prussia. At the same time, it carried out a cruel and bloody suppression of the resistance of the workers and citizens. In this way, the revolutionary anger of the masses was finally ignited.</p>
<p>The working people of Paris, with the workers as the vanguard, united in the midst of thousands of hardships and in the midst of internal and external double iron-blooded oppression, in order not to be slaves of a subjugated country, in order to fight for the independence and freedom of the French nation, and in order to oppose the actions of some people at that time who wavered, compromised, and sold out the interests of the nation and the country, and implemented "holding Qian Ge to defend the country." March 18 (1871) was the day they established the "Paris Commune" to oppose aggression, oppose compromise, resist to the end, and seek independence, freedom, and happiness.</p>
<p>On March 18, the working people of Paris, under the leadership of the workers, held a heroic armed resistance with the soldiers of the National Guard, and joined hands with the government army to overthrow the regime of the aristocratic bourgeois who compromised with × and sold out the nation. The high-ranking officials of the surrendered government fled to Versailles, which had become the headquarters of the × people, and the revolutionary masses established the "Paris Commune."</p>
<p>The "Paris Commune" was the first regime of the hard-working masses in the history of the world. Lenin repeatedly criticized the labor regime "Paris Commune," which was the first to appear in the world and is still being learned by the hard-working masses of all countries, in lengthy articles, saying: When the mass movement of the proletariat broke out, although this movement was a failure, short-lived, and obviously weak, Marx began to study what political form this movement had discovered. The "Commune" is the form that the proletarian revolution "finally discovered," and under this form, the economic liberation of labor can be realized. The "Commune" is the first attempt by the proletariat ×××× to break the state machine of the ×× class, and the political form that was "finally discovered," and this political form can and must be used to replace the destroyed state machine. Lenin went on to say that "the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917, in different environments and under different conditions, continued the cause of the 'Paris Commune,' and proved the correctness of Marx's brilliant historical analysis."</p>
<p>However, the "Paris Commune" regime was submerged in a bloody mess because it did not thoroughly attack the × people, did not establish a solid united front, and the counter-revolutionaries and traitors of France were able to carry out a large-scale counter-offensive with the help of Prussia, resulting in the "Paris Commune" being submerged in a bloody mess and ending its life of more than two months; countless freedom-seeking people and workers suffered cruel massacres, until the water of the Seine River was stained red!</p>
<p>(II) The Experience and Lessons of the [Paris Commune]</p>
<p>Although the Western "March 18th," the revolution of the "Paris Commune," had a short life of only more than two months, it became a model for the struggle of human beings seeking freedom all over the world. Lenin used the following words to describe the revolutionary teacher Marx's emphasis on the "Paris Commune." "Marx was not only overjoyed by the heroic spirit of the 'soaring' members of the 'Paris Commune,' but he also believed that this mass revolutionary movement (although it did not achieve its goal) was a historical experience of great significance, a considerable advance in the world ×××× revolution, and a practical step mule that was more important than hundreds of programs and arguments. To analyze this experience, to draw strategic lessons from this experience, and to re-examine one's own theory on the basis of this experience, these are the tasks that Marx himself identified."</p>
<p>What is the "historical experience of great significance" that the "Paris Commune" left us? The first is that it proved to us with the fact of overthrowing the regime that compromised and sold out the nation halfway that the united resistance force of the workers and masses and the hard-working masses is invincible. All struggles of the oppressed against the oppressors must have the direct and active participation of the hard-working masses in order to finally succeed.</p>
<p>The second, the "Paris Commune" pointed out to us the only path to victory in the revolutionary struggle, "A true revolution of the masses is for the majority of the masses, and the deepest social stratum of the masses under various oppressions and exploitations, to stand up independently, and they use their own demands and their own attempts to build a new society on the ruins of the destroyed old society according to their own interests, and affect half the journey of the revolution."</p>
<p>Third, it also used the establishment of the "Paris Commune," the regime of the hard-working masses, to illustrate to us that the hard-working masses should destroy and smash the "ready-made state machine—and not only be limited to simply seizing this machine.</p>
<p>Fourth, what should be used to replace the broken state apparatus? The "Paris Commune" also answered us with the facts of the prompts, that is, to use "××××, that is, the hard-working masses' own organization, to become the ruling class," to "replace it with the acquisition of democracy." The "Paris Commune" The first decree was to replace the standing army with the armed masses. The "Paris Commune" was organized by city representatives elected by the districts of Paris according to the general election system. They were fully responsible and could be replaced at any time. Most of them were personnel or were considered representatives of the working class. The police, who had always been state government workers, were immediately stripped of all their political functions and became the responsible agency of the Commune, as were the officials of all other administrative agencies. From the members of the Commune, from top to bottom, all personnel serving society were given workers' wages. All state privileges and office expenses disappeared along with the demise of these officials themselves. The majority of the members of the "Paris Commune" were able to replace the privileged minority (privileged officials, generals of the standing army) and directly perform all functions themselves. The functions of state power were increasingly performed by the entire population. It changed from bourgeois democracy to labor democracy, from the democracy of the oppressors to the democracy of the oppressed.</p>
<p>Fifth, the "Paris Commune" adopted a new system to replace the corrupt representative system of selling one's body in capitalist society. Under this new system, there is freedom of judgment and discussion. The representatives must operate themselves, must implement their own laws themselves, must examine themselves The results obtained in actual life must also be directly responsible to the voters themselves. It proves to us that: "To eliminate the official system everywhere immediately and thoroughly is a bird utopia, but it is possible to destroy the old official machine at one stroke and immediately build a new organization to gradually eliminate all official systems. The most direct current task of the revolutionary hard-working masses.</p>
<p>Sixth, the experience of the "Paris Commune" also tells us that "national unity" should not be destroyed. On the contrary, it should be organized by means of the commune system. The unity of the people should become a reality. The method is to eliminate the state power that considers itself to be the embodiment of this unity, but at the same time wants to be independent of the nation and stand above the nation. The centralism of the awakened democratic hard-working masses must be contrasted with the centralism of the warlords and bureaucrats of the asset class.</p>
<p>Although the "Paris Commune" created these many historical experiences of great significance, it itself failed under the glorious history of two months. The first failure was that the objective environment at that time was not fully mature. The first was that they did not thoroughly eliminate the efforts of the French and foreign counter-revolutionaries, so that the × people could calmly implement a large-scale joint general counter-offensive, and suffered an irreparable tragic defeat. The third was that their own united front was not consolidated and developed, and the leading party did not closely unite the parties, and at the same time neglected rural work, and could not unite the vast peasants around themselves, sitting and making × Fangde calmly implement provocative strategies, sitting and making the peasants become a powerful team to attack Paris.</p>
<p>(III) Conclusion</p>
<p>Summarizing the experiences and lessons left to us by the two glorious and great festivals of "March 18th" in the East and the West, and in conjunction with the new environment and new tasks of the new stage of our Chinese nation's War of Resistance against Japan, we must move forward more heroically today along the blood path of the martyrs of the Beijing Massacre and the Paris bloody battle, and promote the anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle to realize national independence and freedom and world true peace. At the same time, we must also accept the experiences and lessons of the Beijing Massacre and the Paris bloody battle, on the one hand, strengthen our internal unity, expand our united front, and increase our aid force internationally and in the × camp, especially by starting with the promotion and development of the provincial, municipal, and county councils, and actively implement democratic politics so that the lively forces of the entire nation, especially the workers, peasants, and working masses, can be concentrated under unified leadership to serve the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. On the other hand, we must intensify the efforts to break the conspiracy of the × people to use Han traitors and "anti-communist," "pro-peace," and "compromise halfway" remarks and actions to achieve "using Chinese to control Chinese," and intensify the increase of the × people's domestic, military, and international difficulties, resolutely support the protracted War of Resistance, and strive for final victory.</p>
<h3>The Decline of Japanese Liberalists (II)</h3>
<p>—Original by He Sell</p>
<p>Originally published in [Asia Magazine]</p>
<p>The officials of various government agencies also felt that the matters within their duties were being encroached upon by military agencies. I found that the people in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were very dissatisfied, especially those in the unlucky East Asia Bureau. In addition, some people who worked in the government had the opportunity to know the inside story of Japanese finances, and they believed that Japan's deposits and cash were not enough to support an expanded war against China.</p>
<p>Most of the members of the Japanese Diet are also liberalists. Three members and several American journalists held informal talks last time. They showed amazing open-mindedness when discussing various issues, especially when discussing the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Liberalists also accounted for a large percentage of the journalists. They can still scold the cabinet members, but they have to be euphemistic when it comes to the military. They can write articles to discuss various military issues, but they are detained when sent to the inspection office. Finally, speaking of a group of political elders around the Japanese Emperor, they are also inclined to liberalists. Except for the only veteran Saionji, who is not a member, such as Hiranuma, Makino, Matsudaira, Kan'e, and Kiyoura, one can still see some traditional ideas of the Meiji era.</p>
<p>Since Japanese liberalists occupy so many sectors of society, the authorities regard them as more terrible than communists and workers. Japan has a well-established judicial system and a strict police organization, and those who are stirring at the bottom are not difficult to catch in one fell swoop, but it is not so easy to deal with liberalists. They are now entrenched in important places, and their plans are beyond the reach of the local prosecutor's ears. They have potential power, and they may be able to change the most important issues of the country overnight and exert their full power.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between the position of liberalists in Japan and their position in other totalitarian countries such as Germany and Italy lies in this. As we said above, they are still entrenched in key positions, and once they have organized action, it will definitely be popular throughout the country. It is not difficult for them to get the support of the royal family, which is indeed the most complex and difficult point in Japan now. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Our Troops in Jin and Yu Provinces Counterattacked for Days; Cannon Warfare Confrontation across the Xiang River in Central Hubei; × Troops Were Severely Attacked by the Poyang Lake</h3>
<p>[This Paper's Telegram] Xi'an Telegram: Our troops in Jin Province have been counterattacking for days, and the battle situation has stabilized. In the Wanquan and Linjin areas of southwestern Jin Province, a guerrilla unit of our army has cleared out most of the × bandits nearby. After the × bandits invading Ningwu County attacked Shenchi, we are counterattacking. Wuzhai and Kelan are both in our hands. Fierce battles have been fought for days between Pinglu and Pianguan. We recovered Goubao and are continuing the battle. Lishi is surrounded on three sides by our forces. Nearby Lijiawan and Hejiaqiao have also been recovered by us. The × bandits near Dawu Town have been completely resolved.</p>
<p>[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th] The battle situation in the occupied areas is still fierce. A telegram from Shaanxi stated that local battles have been quite intense in various parts of Jin Province for days. However, the × bandits are still busy building fortifications, repairing roads, stationing troops, and stockpiling grain along the communication lines. A certain unit of our army in southwestern Jin Province has been attacking the × bandits in recent days and has approached Wenxi and Xiaxian. The Tongpu Railway has been repeatedly damaged by us, causing extreme panic among the × bandits. The × bandits from Anze invading Qinyuan in eastern Jin Province were intercepted by us at Dayang Village and Jiaokou River and made no progress. In the past two or three days, the × bandits have suffered casualties of four to five hundred men. The × bandits invading Jiyuan in northern Henan Province number only three to four hundred men. With our forces attacking from three sides, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. After we captured Zhaoyuan in eastern Shandong Province, we are continuing to attack the × bandits near Qixia.</p>
<p>[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 17th] A telegram from Jingmen stated that in central Hubei, our army and the × bandits are still confronting each other across the river. Our army shelled the east bank of Shayang, killing many × bandits. A certain unit of our army attacked the × bandits north of Zhongxiang and achieved considerable gains. There was also cannon warfare between Xihe and Suizhou.</p>
<p>[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th] As of the 16th, there were no major battles on any of the battlefields. Although the × bandits are actively deploying, judging from the current situation, a large-scale invasion is unlikely. A telegram from Jingmen stated that in Shayang, central Hubei, our army and the × bandits are still confronting each other across the Xiang River. The × bandits currently occupy the area east of the river and near Jiukou, totaling about two thousand men. The × bandits in Yangzi, Zhongxiang, have adopted a defensive posture. The × bandits in Xihe, numbering about three thousand men, are urgently plotting to invade westward, and we have taken strict precautions. Although the × bandits in northern Jiangxi Province are attempting to attack Nanchang, we are awaiting them with heavy troops and will surely inflict heavy losses on them. Several dozen × bandits who landed on the shore of Duchang on Poyang Lake a few days ago were annihilated by us. The battle situation in northern Hunan Province is quiet.</p>
<p>[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 17th] A telegram from Zhengzhou stated that our army is counterattacking Qiyuan in northern Henan Province, and fierce battles are raging with the × bandits. The × bandits are urgently trying to repair the Xinxiang-Kaifeng railway, but our guerrilla sabotage is making it difficult to complete. The × bandits near Zhongmou have been attacked by us for days and have suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 17th] A telegram from Guilin stated that twenty to thirty × planes have arrived on Hainan Island. Their main force is still in Haikou, Changya County, Ding'an, and Qiongzhou. A unit of × bandits was heavily defeated near Qiongdong by our forces. The war in Guangdong is quiet. A certain unit of our army is approaching Xinjie. The × bandits who landed in Pingfeng, northern Jiangxi Province, a few days ago have suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by us for days.</p>
<p>[This Paper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th] A telegram from Guilin stated that the war situation in South China is stable. The × bandits in Guangdong and on Hainan Island are busy building fortifications.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai, 17th] A Japanese military spokesman stated that Chinese troops are actively launching guerrilla warfare in the Nanjing, Wuhu, and Jiujiang areas to contain Japanese activities in Hubei. He continued that the Chinese army has concentrated five divisions on the Hangzhou River, which apparently indicates that a large-scale counterattack will be launched soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hequ, 17th] When our army recovered Jiaokou (4 kilometers south of Shicheng), they killed over × bandits, including four × officers. The wounded were countless. They captured over 70,000 rounds of ammunition, over 100 rifles, seven light machine guns, two pistols, telephones, binoculars, gas masks, and many other items.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hequ, 16th] The reasons for the × bandit's attack on the northwest of the camp this time: first, our implementation of the scorched earth policy has been quite effective; second, the × bandits' reinforcements are insufficient, with only about 3,000 troops in total. The number of dead and wounded before and after has reached over 1,000, leading to a disastrous defeat. Our army's morale is even more boosted after this victory.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xiangyang, 17th] Four × planes bombed Fan today at 10:00 AM, one of which was hit by our forces, caught fire, and fell. Seven × planes then bombed Xiangyang. The × plane shot down landed on Luosha Beach. Over a hundred bombs were dropped in Ji'an.</p>
<h3>Our Troops on the Eastern Front Inflicted a Fatal Blow on the × Bandits; Implementing a Comprehensive Countermeasure to Prevent the × Bandits from Plundering; Mobile and Surprise Battles are Unfolding in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] A reporter's report on the current situation regarding the × bandits after travelling from Hangzhou to southern Anhui is as follows:</p>
<p>Hangzhou-Fuyang</p>
<p>(A) There are about two to three thousand × troops between Hangzhou and Fuyang, with very few reinforcements or reductions. The × bandits have boasted that they will build permanent fortifications along Wukang, Yuhang, Fuyang, the lakes, and mountainous areas. However, no activity has been seen in days. Looking at the forts from afar in Fuyang, the × bandit sentries are very sparse, and the situation remains the same. It is said that the Lu Zhangsheng bandit troops and the × troops coming and going between Jiaxing and Haining are more numerous. It is rumored to be a mixed brigade, intending to eliminate our guerrilla units on the coast. There have been repeated battles in recent days.</p>
<p>Taihu Lake</p>
<p>(B) There are about two divisions of × bandit troops along both sides of Taihu Lake and along the river to Wuhu. Their main force is clearly stationed in Shanghai and concentrated in two places between people and Zhi, ready to use the railway and highway lines for rapid transport in case of emergency. According to reliable reports, there are mostly two to three hundred × bandit troops between the large and small mountains around the lake, and as few as four to five hundred. They patrol day and night.</p>
<p>Active operations. The large basin shaped like a Buddha bow facing northwest to Yang is a weak link in the × bandits' military deployment. Judging from the panicked situation of the puppet organizations recently, the × bandits are already feeling the difficulty of defense.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>(C) The × bandit army is using the heavy pressure of one and a half divisions, divided into three routes, to press southward along the coastline, urgently trying to open up the Huai River and the Qian River in order to facilitate transportation. Since our army retreated from Lianshui and Huaiyin to south of the Huai River the day before yesterday, it has disintegrated into smaller units to carry out comprehensive mobile surprise battles. The area around Funing, Yancheng, and Dongtai will be the center of the war in northern Jiangsu. However, the offensive of the × bandits has weakened recently.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui</p>
<p>(D) The × bandit army is close to the ferry crossing on the opposite bank of Anqing. On the river surface between Dadu Kou and Lishu Xiang Kou to the west, the × bandit speedboats have been patrolling closely in recent days. Since the dawn of the 3rd of this month, after three hundred × puppet troops attacked the Second District of Dongliu and were defeated by our self-defense forces, it has been silent. Since Wangjiang City on the north bank of the Yangtze River was recovered on the 6th, the × bandits have not dared to act recklessly. There are no × bandits in Fengtai, north of Susong County, and local order has also stabilized slightly.</p>
<p>The × bandits also claim that the eastern battlefield is a place for economic and political warfare. The × puppet newspapers have repeatedly spread false peace rhetoric. Judging from their intentions, they clearly want to deceive our people with false peace in order to weaken our side's will to fight, and take advantage of the rich resources of our Taihu Lake basin, trying to avoid direct battles, and to implement their insidious plan of plunder. We have begun comprehensive countermeasures, and will give the × bandits a fatal blow.</p>
<h3>The × Bandits are Promoting a Poisonous Policy in Hankou; Large Quantities of Opium are Shipped from Outside the Pass; Troops are Dispatched to Force Residents to Purchase and Smoke Opium</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hankou, 17th] According to news from Chinese sources in this city, since the Japanese army occupied it, the Japanese army has shipped as much as one hundred tons of opium from "Manchuria". The Japanese army, through the Wuhan Security Maintenance Association, has notified [the local opium dealers] to purchase the newly arrived opium as soon as possible, otherwise they would be accused of resisting Japan. However, the dealers, due to their existing inventory and repeated price drops, found it difficult to sell. In addition, their capital was extremely limited, totaling only 24,000 yuan for all of them, so they were unable to continue purchasing. The Japanese side finally ordered them to withdraw secured loans from local banks to purchase opium. It was also learned that on March 8th, three Japanese soldiers carried opium westward along Haoxi River, forcing people to buy it. This Japanese plan to poison Wuhan is entirely managed directly by the Japanese military authorities. The budget for the "Wuhan Security Maintenance Association" Tobacco Prohibition Bureau for February of this year totaled 984,550 yuan, of which 25,000 yuan was revenue from the sale of opium and 55,000 yuan was tax collected from opium smokers and opium dens. There are currently over ten opium dens in this city, with over a thousand smokers.</p>
<h3>Murder Case of a Rickshaw Puller in Shanghai; Corpse Discovered</h3>

<h3>Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce Escapes After Being Kidnapped; Abducted in a × Occupied Area; Fortunately, He Was Discovered Immediately and Returned to Tianjin Safely</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] Mr. Diatali, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in this city, was kidnapped today from his residence in the former German concession (now occupied by the Japanese army) by three men dressed in Chinese clothing and forced into a car.

The thugs in the car were quickly disarmed by the police. After contacting Tianjin by telephone, they sent people to escort Mr. Diatali back to Tianjin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai, 17th] According to sources from Wei Yang, those who kidnapped Mr. Diatali, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin, were Japanese dressed in Chinese clothing, not Chinese.</p>
<h3>After the × Bandits Invaded Hainan Island, Security in Annam is Strengthened; France Dispatches a Squadron of Pursuit Aircraft to the East; Military Exercises are Unprecedented in Scale</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 17th] Since the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, the defense of French Annam has been greatly strengthened. Currently, the French side is establishing an aircraft factory in Annam to manufacture aircraft. This funding will be allocated from the colony's finances. Foreign ships are prohibited from sailing to Cam Ranh Bay. Soon, the French side will dispatch fifty high-speed pursuit aircraft to Annam to strengthen the defense there. The new airport newly established by the French at Da Nang (north of Cam Ranh) was completed on February 23. A part of the Annamese Air Force is currently stationed there, and the French side will soon dispatch additional aircraft to Da Nang to strengthen its defense. An unprecedented large-scale military exercise will be held in Annam this year. At that time, a military delegation from Siam will come to Hanoi to participate in the review.</p>

<h3>Osaka Arsenal Explosion Case; Anti-War Elements Executed by Firing Squad; × Feels Embarrassed and is Now Studying Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to news from Tianjin, the explosion at the Osaka Army Arsenal on the 1st of this month caused heavy losses to the × bandits. It has been confirmed that this incident was an actual anti-war action by anti-war elements. The initiators were examiner Kawasaki Gi, Second Lieutenant of Artillery Masumoto Hachigake, and Artillery Warrant Officer Kawasaki et al. within the arsenal. They were arrested on the 11th and executed by firing squad in Osaka Zhonggong District. The implications of this case are very widespread. The × bandits feel deeply embarrassed and are now studying countermeasures, but they are still keeping it secret and using accidental fire as a cover.</p>
<h3>Jing Sha Youth Wartime Service Corps (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>The performance of dramas and singing is even more countless. They have worked with the civil movement team to mobilize and organize the masses, first forming the Bundled Goods Workers' Union, with over 1,100 members; second, the Cotton Factory Workers' Union, with 1,300 members; the Drama Association, with over 400 members; and the Rickshaw Pullers' Union, the Medical Association, etc. In total, there are sixty trade unions under the control of the corps, with a total of over 10,000 members. After the corps launched a donation campaign after the major industries relocated to the interior, it was able to obtain over 100,000 yuan in a short period of three months, which is a good example of their ability to effectively mobilize the masses.</p>
<p>Before launching the donation campaign, the corps publicized the meaning of the donation to various workers' unions and set a total donation target of 100,000 yuan for the city. The amount each union should donate was based on the prosperity of the union members. For example, the Bundled Goods Workers' Union was asked to donate 500 yuan, but they actually donated 1,000 yuan. Among them was a 15-year-old female worker who donated all of her savings from half a year's wages, 13 yuan, after deducting living expenses. The Drama Association was asked to donate 500 yuan. They collected donations from theater performances and exceeded 600 yuan before the deadline. A famous performer suddenly appeared and spoke out in support of the donation during a performance of a famous play, donating 50 yuan herself, and the audience donated several hundred yuan on the spot. Similar enthusiastic donations were made by other industries, resulting in remarkable results. However, this is also a result of the corps promoting the spirit of "leadership from the top down, promotion from the bottom up", first uniting the military and civilians as one, and then achieving satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Rongchao, the corps leader with a Yu Youren-style full beard, wears the same material military uniform as the corps members and messengers, with the rank of major general, looking imposing, somewhat like "Old General Huang Zhong". In fact, when asked about his age, he is only 34 years old. He was previously a professor of philosophy at Sun Yat-sen University and attended an anti-Japanese cadre training class. Currently, he is entrusted by the Wartime Relief Association to lead these young people in anti-war work, so he can manage everything with ease and cultivate a beautiful flower from the strength of the people of Jing Sha.</p>
<p>Several young people in the corps came to my hotel to talk to me. They are young people around twenty years old, their cheeks flushed with youth, perhaps from being blown by the frivolous Xuefeng. They have an attitude and demeanor like the sons of "scholarly families", truly refined and elegant! No wonder a friend who looked down from upstairs mistakenly thought they were "female comrades". However, their true spirit, which is stored in their hearts and manifested in their backs, fully shows that they already possess the basic qualities that a soldier must have: a strong physique, a firm determination, and alertness. Moreover, they have had a small trial run, capturing and executing several traitors.</p>
<p>We, the sons and daughters of China who are fortunate enough to be born in this great era of national revival, should all "cross the sea like the Eight Immortals, each displaying their unique abilities." If we don't quickly do what we can: those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength, those with talent (planning) contribute talent, and seize the opportunity to establish special merits, when else will we wait?</p>
<h3>Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce Issues Statement; Exposes × Economic Conspiracy in North China; Calls on All Parties to Unite to Defeat It</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 17th] Sir Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in this city, issued a solemn official statement today. On behalf of the British Chamber of Commerce, he lodged a serious protest against Japan's implementation of the new currency system in North China. The full text of the statement is as follows:</p>
<p>The pseudo "North China Provisional Government's" new currency system began to be implemented in major cities and ports of North China on March 11, including Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihaiwei. The purpose of this new currency system is to expel Chinese legal tender and circulate the banknotes of the pseudo "United Reserve Bank". The banknotes of this "United Reserve Bank" are closely linked to the Japanese yen and have extremely insufficient reserves. In terms of foreign exchange, they have no value at all, while Chinese legal tender has sufficient reserves and a fixed value in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the circulation of the "Reserve Bank" banknotes, the pseudo "Provisional Government" has prohibited customs from approving the export of goods and ordered those who order goods to purchase "Reserve Bank" foreign exchange at a fixed price of fourteen shillings at the Yokohama Specie Bank. This measure will gradually lead to a situation where Japanese banks tend to monopolize finance. If commerce continues to operate on this basis, the "Reserve Bank" banknotes with insufficient reserves will be supported by foreign exchange. The result of this forced circulation of "Reserve Bank" banknotes will be that most foreign businesses will be on the verge of suspension or closure, because they cannot conduct transactions with banknotes that cannot be converted into foreign exchange. Japanese merchants are in a different position, because they can accept "Reserve Bank" banknotes and use them to purchase goods in Japan. At the same time, this new currency system will first affect Chinese exporters, and soon importers of foreign goods (non-Japanese goods) will be similarly affected - that is, the foreign exchange obtained from export trade, that is, "Reserve Bank" banknotes, cannot be guaranteed to be used for import trade, and as a result, the import trade of non-Japanese goods will inevitably be sharply reduced. What is even more advanced is that even if the foreign exchange obtained can be used for import trade, the insufficient reserve value will make the distribution system controlled by the "Reserve Bank", creating a situation that violates existing treaties and controls and restricts the import of foreign goods.</p>
<p>This compulsory implementation of a currency system with insufficient reserves in North China will have a detrimental effect on the sources and channels of British aid and distribution. If Japan succeeds in linking the Chinese currency system to the Japanese yen, all foreign merchants will suffer greatly, as they have tragically suffered in Manchuria. Therefore, this new currency system is extremely unfair to British interests and violates the principles of the Open Door and equal opportunity. We must make every effort to ensure its failure. The British Council recently lodged a serious protest against this illegal plan, because it not only harms the interests of British merchants, but also harms the interests of all non-Japanese parties, and as a result, it will throw harm into a larger area.</p>
<h3>Local Financial Conference; Closing Remarks by Kong Xiangxi; We Should Continue to Work Hard in the Future; Strengthen Cooperation and Promote Talent</h3>
<p>At this local financial conference convened by the Ministry of Finance, everyone has been able to concentrate, report in detail, and discuss meticulously during the short five-day conference period. And during the review and discussion, everyone has been able to bring into play their understanding from experience, knowledge, and strategies to contribute to the country and society, which is of great significance.</p>
<p>Today, the supreme leader, in his instructions, instructed us that there are three important things during the war of resistance: one is military affairs, the second is education, and the third is the economy. The economy is closely related to finance, and finance is the mother of all undertakings. Without finance, everything is just empty talk and cannot be realized. Therefore, to maintain the source of finance, we must develop the economy, and to develop the economy, it is most important to consolidate finance and seek its development.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you come from all over the country, either in charge of local finances or presiding over local finance. Your responsibilities are very important. It is a rare opportunity in ancient times to be able to gather together in this extraordinary period to discuss various major plans for the country to achieve the goal of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Recently, many people have discussed the government's meeting problems, saying that meetings are held without discussion, discussions are held without decisions, decisions are made without implementation, and implementation is weak. This is probably because the personnel attending general meetings like to propose motions, and there are too many motions to discuss at one time. Therefore, they have no choice but to submit them to the government for review. Although there are not many motions at this conference, they are greatly related to the war of resistance, nation-building, and national revival. This can be said to be a historical meeting, and its important nature is naturally different from ordinary meetings. After careful research and discussion, we have decided on a very good plan, which must be implemented one by one and must not be put on the shelf. It is hoped that everyone will understand the importance of their responsibilities and mission, and after returning to their local areas, will earnestly implement the plan and strive to correct the past problems.</p>
<p>In the future, the supreme leader instructed that "the financial sector's various measures in the past have made great contributions to the country." Our military weapons are indeed inferior to others, but our financial system and economic organization are feared by the × bandits. Although the × bandits have used all kinds of methods to destroy our finance and destroy our economy, they have wasted their efforts and have achieved nothing. Now, after a long period of struggle, our legal tender's credit is still very solid. Even internationally, it has gained a very high status and reputation. The reports of the HSBC Bank shareholders' meeting and the speeches of British Finance Minister Simon have praised the credit of our legal tender. Not only is the attitude of third parties like this, but even the treatises written by scholars and experts from the × bandit side cannot but admit this fact. From this, it can be known that China's currency and finance have achieved considerable status internationally.</p>
<p>However, the acquisition of this achievement and reputation is by no means achieved by luck or accident, but is the result of the hard work of many people in the past. It is of great benefit to the war of resistance, nation-building, and national revival. We must not only maintain this situation, but also promote and expand it. Therefore, we must continue to work hard in the future. Since this conference has a detailed plan, it must be implemented step by step and diligently. In addition, we must strengthen cooperation and have a complete plan and a complete organization. We must never act on our own and without a fixed target. I once said to the attendees at the education conference that education is the mother of the country. Our future education should cultivate talents that are suitable for the following four conditions: First, have a noble personality; second, have a sound physique; third, have applicable skills; and fourth, have a cooperative spirit. This is not only the way education should be done, but also the way you should train talents in the future. In the past, the result of education was that, on the one hand, talents graduating from schools felt that there was nothing to do, and on the other hand, society felt that there was no available talent. School graduates did not meet the needs of society, and society could not accommodate these talents. This is the shortcoming of past education. In the future, the financial sector should also reward and cultivate the younger generation and promote talents who possess the above four conditions. This is a very important task of the financial sector.</p>
<p>Recently, transportation has not been very convenient, and everyone has their own tasks and cannot stay here for long. Therefore, this conference will end today. It is hoped that everyone can implement this conference's plan in a practical way, unite with all parties, and select and train talents who can help themselves. This is to help the country. What I have said today is not without value for everyone's reference. I hope you will work harder, hope that this war can defeat the × bandits and end soon, build China under the Three Principles of the People, not only to revive the Chinese nation, but also to achieve the highest goal of the world being for all and universal harmony.</p>
<h3>Gosse Flies Over from Chongqing Next Week</h3>

<h3>Englishman Sympathizes with Our Country; Compiles and Publishes a Guide to Inferior Goods</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Chairman Inness of the Menziesde Boycott Japanese Goods Committee recently wrote to the Menziesde Customs Report that Japan's export trade to Britain and the United States has fallen sharply by 22% to 18%. Japan relies on the foreign exchange earned from export trade to purchase gasoline, so that its aircraft can fly over the Chinese mainland and bomb to death 100,000 peace-loving Chinese civilians. Our association has compiled a "Store Guide" listing the names of imported Japanese goods. We hope that all parties will actively boycott Japanese goods.</p>
<h3>The Cabinet Met Yesterday; Daladier Plans to Go to England to Discuss Military and Political Cooperation Steps; Maintain Close Relations with Soviet Poland</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] According to sources close to authority, Daladier will convene a cabinet meeting today to prepare to respond to questions in the House of Representatives regarding foreign affairs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] According to well-informed sources, Daladier will request the cabinet today to pass laws granting the government special powers to change the 40-hour work system in armaments factories in the event of an international emergency.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] French Prime Minister Daladier convened an emergency meeting of ministers yesterday to discuss whether he should go to England to discuss concrete policies and steps for British-French military and political cooperation and to resist the expansion of "evil forces."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] Government officials discussed yesterday the proposal for Prime Minister Daladier to go to England. Daladier plans to go to England next week to hold an emergency meeting with the British side to discuss military and political responses to Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] According to sources in Paris, the Czech incident is sufficient to strengthen Chamberlain's determination to expand the military, believing that this is the only way to save England and France. Foreign Secretary Halifax told the Foreign Affairs Committee that he believed that close relations should be maintained with Soviet Poland. He had consulted with the Soviet ambassador many times. Poland has indicated to France that if France is attacked, Poland will immediately fulfill its treaty obligations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 16th] Parliamentary circles anticipate that the government may abandon its appeasement policy and work with the Soviet Union to promote diplomatic relations, replacing the understanding between Britain and Germany. Well-informed sources here have confirmed that the cabinet will be reorganized soon.</p>
<p>England and France Decide to Recall Ambassadors to Germany</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] According to reliable sources, England and France have agreed to recall their ambassadors to Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] At the House of Commons meeting last night, Labor opposition leader Attlee asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he had obtained more information about Central Europe than reported in the newspapers. The Prime Minister replied that the information he had received confirmed the newspaper reports. Maclean then asked the Prime Minister whether the government intended to withdraw the ambassador in Berlin, as his information was so unreliable. The Prime Minister replied that the government was currently considering whether to recall the ambassador to hear a more detailed report.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] In the House of Commons today, someone asked about the status of the British ambassador to Germany, saying whether the government had decided to recall the ambassador to listen to a report or to permanently recall the ambassador. Sir Simon replied that this matter was under urgent consideration by the government. He replied to another question that the British ambassador to Germany had sent official information about the situation in Central Europe to Foreign Secretary Halifax. Regarding the Czech incident, the British government is currently maintaining contact with the French government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] The British government has recalled its ambassador to Germany, Henderson. Hitler is therefore also planning to recall the German ambassador to Britain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] A diplomatic observer recently wrote an article commenting on the Czech question, temporarily unable to determine the attitude of the British government towards recognizing the German annexation of Czechoslovakia. The summary is as follows: The current situation and attitude of the Czech provinces are still ambiguous, and Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic cannot be equated with the annexation of Austria. At the time of the annexation of Austria, it was invited by [Kurt] Schuschnigg (former Austrian Federal Chancellor) to request German assistance. However, in this Czech incident, even the German propaganda machine dared not say that the German army entered the Czech Republic at the invitation of the Czech president. The difference in nature is evident here. Moreover, Chamberlain has strongly stated that Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia is a violation of the Munich Agreement. The British government attaches great importance to the gold and foreign currency deposited by the former Czech government in the Bank of England. The Bank of England has now been ordered by the government to withhold this currency. In the future, when the British government discusses the repayment of Czech debts with Germany, this currency will be a powerful guarantee, and Czech creditors may be able to avoid the repetition of the Austrian incident and obtain a more satisfactory compensation. Since Sir Newton, the British minister to Czechoslovakia, was transferred to Iraq as ambassador, before the British government decides to send a consul-general to Czechoslovakia, all matters will be temporarily handled by a chargé d'affaires. It is generally speculated that Henderson, the US ambassador to Germany, will soon return home to report on the overall situation. However, apart from reporting and briefing, it is believed that Henderson's return home will not have a more serious diplomatic mission.</p>
<p>Rumors of Cabinet Reshuffle in Britain</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent wrote today that it is widely rumored in parliamentary circles that Foreign Secretary Halifax, with the support of some Conservative members, is leading a movement to reorganize the cabinet, hoping to establish a new government based on a broad foundation. It is said that the new government will include former Foreign Secretary Eden and Churchill. The conscription system may also be implemented. The purpose is to show Germany an uncompromising attitude. Compulsory national service and a reserve system are difficult to implement without considering the attitude of the opposition party. The Labor Party has expressed a cold attitude towards the establishment of a broad government. The Liberal Party's attitude is less cold. The current government has given up adopting compulsory national service because it has been severely opposed by the Labor Party and the United Party.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden recently suggested organizing a national conference to be responsible for advising the government on various foreign policy issues. Eden's plan indicates that the conference should include representatives from all parties and factions across the country, as well as all Privy Council members from both houses of Parliament. If this plan is implemented, the conference will include Eden, Churchill, Cooper, Baldwin, Lloyd George, Attlee, Sinclair, and Hoare. It is reported that general foreign policy issues were discussed during the meeting between Eden and Halifax yesterday. Eden was specially granted access to all reports related to Central and Eastern Europe. Some believe that this may be the cause of the rumors of a cabinet reshuffle.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Rumors circulating abroad that Prime Minister Chamberlain is about to resign are untrue.</p>
<h3>Hitler Arrived in Moravia Yesterday Afternoon; Spoke to the Italian Prime Minister Before Leaving Beijing; Hacha Will Be Appointed Head of the Protectorate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] Hitler spent yesterday afternoon in an unknown location and will enter the Moravian capital at noon today. German troops are now advancing there in order to hold a military parade today in preparation for Hitler's inspection. Hitler will then return to Vienna.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Czech Beijing, 17th] It is rumored here that Hitler spoke to Mussolini for fifteen minutes before leaving here last night. Hitler is currently traveling to the Moravian capital.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Czech Beijing, 16th] Today, Hitler received Czech President Hacha at the Old Castle and gave him a military salute. The German news agency still calls him "President." It is possible that Hacha will still be appointed as the head of the Protectorate, and his title will be "Protector".</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] German troops have occupied most of Bohemia without encountering any resistance. The Czech army is still stationed in the barracks. It is said that when transferring military power, a suitable and dignified ceremony will be used.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] After Hitler issued a declaration on Slovakia, he exchanged telegrams with the President of Slovakia, and the President of Slovakia handed Slovakia over to German protection. German troops are now advancing into Slovakia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Czech Beijing, 16th] It is estimated that 5,000 people have been arrested here, and 200,000 people have been mobilized. Approximately 30,000 people are stationed in Czech Beijing. It is reported that the Czech gold is being prepared to be transported to Germany, amounting to approximately 68,050,000 to 85,687,000 yuan. Approximately 22 percent is deposited in London and other places.</p>
<h3>Germany's Annexation of the Czech Republic Yields Great Gains</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] All sectors in London are discussing today the economic impact of Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic, believing that Germany has gained greatly this time and has obtained a great deal of excellent military equipment, sufficient for 40 divisions of the most modern army. In addition, Germany has obtained cash worth 25 million pounds. Other possible gains of 10 million to 20 million pounds are not included. The 700,000 textile machines in the Czech Republic, totaling 1.65 million spindles, will also be acquired by Germany. Previously, the Czech Republic exported cotton yarn and cloth to various European countries, especially to the Netherlands, and their value was lower than the exports of Lancashire in England. In the future, such exports will be impossible under the German economic system, so the cotton weaving industry in Lancashire will be more developed as a result. In addition, there is an important economic point: before the occupation of the Czech Republic, Germany's population and raw material supply had developed to the peak and could not be increased any further. Now that the Czech Republic has been occupied, in addition to acquiring some people, it can also acquire a large number of raw materials.</p>
<h3>Anxiety in Rome; People Are Discussing Whether War Will Break Out</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] The public's mind here is extremely unstable. People on the street are discussing whether war will break out. Some people have withdrawn their savings from banks, fearing that the development of the international situation may have serious repercussions in Romania. Jews are even more uneasy, believing that the Czech situation will trigger a new anti-Semitic movement.</p>
<h3>Hungary Announces Occupation of Ruthenia; Volosin and Others Fled to Romania; Romania Decides to Close Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hungarian Beijing, 17th] Hungary has formally notified the governments of Germany, Italy, Poland, and Romania of its action to occupy Ruthenia. Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy issued an order to the Hungarian army today, saying, "The difficult task of the Hungarian army is to liberate Ruthenia."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hungarian Beijing, 16th] The Hungarian Chief of Staff issued an official report today, declaring that the Hungarian army has occupied the capital of Ruthenia, and said that a team has arrived at the Berlan border.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hungarian Beijing, 16th] When the Hungarian army occupied the important town of Zhustada in Ruthenia, it only encountered sporadic resistance from local people and did not encounter organized resistance. Its biggest difficulties were bad weather and inconvenient transportation. Most of the Czech army has fled to Romania.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shuster City, 16th] It is reported that the Ruthenian army has assembled on the front line of Ersa City, repelled the Hungarian army, and is counterattacking southwards.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, 27th] It is learned that the Romanian government has decided to close the border between Romania and Ruthenia to prevent refugees from entering. A message from Jeda said that Czech and Ruthenian refugees crossed the border all day yesterday. There are now more than 5,000 people in and around Jeda. The Romanian authorities will send Czech refugees to Yugoslavia to return to Bohemia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hungarian Beijing, 16th] Ruthenian Prime Minister Volosin has fled to Romania, requesting that his country be subordinated to Romania. When he arrived in Jeda, a Ruthenian officer attempted to assassinate him, but was arrested by the police.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Jeda, 16th] Czech military vehicles are constantly entering Romanian territory, carrying approximately 50 officers and 2,000 soldiers. Volosin's family relatives and daily necessities were also brought along. In addition, there are 2,000 Czech Jews and Ruthenians, all fleeing here. Before 7:00 PM today (standard time), when the Hungarian army arrived in Zhustada, all Czech and Ruthenian officials had fled. The entire Ruthenia has not yet been occupied by the Hungarian army. As for the unoccupied land, the situation is extremely chaotic. According to a Czech senior military officer who arrived here and spoke to a Reuters reporter, the Zhustada war broke out immediately after receiving the Hungarian ultimatum. Young Ruthenian soldiers demanded that the military provide them with weapons. As a result, the military distributed all the weapons to them and then set off for the capital of Romania. Currently, Ruthenians are holding guns to guard the streets and engage in resistance. The officer also said that Ruthenians originally welcomed Germans and had decided to resist Hungarians, but the chances of this wish coming true are very slim.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Jeda, 17th] Ruthenian Minister of Health Durimei and Minister of Transportation Brasger left here today, representing President Volosin, to go to the Hungarian capital to request Hungary to allow Ruthenia to have autonomy within Hungary. Volosin telephoned Berlin yesterday, requesting Germany to persuade Hungary to allow Ruthenia to obtain autonomy. He decided on this action after attempting to seek assistance from the Romanian army to liberate Ruthenia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] According to Ruthenian sources here, Ruthenia has sent a telegram to the four signatory countries of the Munich Agreement, requesting assistance and guaranteeing Ruthenia's independence.</p>
<h3>Czech Envoy to the US Refuses German Takeover of Embassy; British Embassy Has Been Handed Over</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 17th] It is learned that the US government will express its dissatisfaction as much as possible with Hitler's recent actions. It is reported that the Czech minister in Washington has not received orders from Czech Beijing to turn the embassy over to the German embassy. The US ambassador to the Czech Republic will remain in Czech Beijing.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Czech Minister Hebner here refused to accept the request from the German embassy to take over the order today. He declared that he required a written order from his home government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] The German embassy here received the Czech embassy at 6:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Tension on the Soviet-Japanese Border; Japan Transfers Troops to Korea and Manchuria; Soviet Troops Are of Better Quality Than Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 17th] Reliable foreign military sources here today obtained information that, in the past week, a large number of Japanese troops have been transferred from Japan to Manchuria and Korea and then to the border adjacent to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the number reached as many as 40,000. The port of Rajin in Korea near Zhanggufeng is now suddenly closed to all shipping except for Japanese transport ships. Railway transportation between Harbin and Manchuria in Manchuria has also been disrupted due to military transportation. It is also reported that two Japanese divisions totaling 40,000 men arrived on Sakhalin Island at the beginning of this week. The northern part of the island belongs to the Soviet Union, and the southern part belongs to Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ynsk, 16th] It is rumored that the number of Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo" has increased. Political figures here do not attach too much importance to this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 17th] Soviet Far East Army Commander Stern reported at the Communist Party Congress yesterday that, according to the experience of the Zhanggufeng Incident, it can be seen that the quality of the Soviet Far East Army is superior to that of the Japanese army in all aspects. As a result of the purge of the military, the strength of the army has become increasingly strong. It is a rumor that the Far East Army lacks generals.</p>
<h3>Impact of German Annexation of the Czech Republic; US Policy Becomes More Resolute; Roosevelt Will Reintroduce Defense of Guam; Army Chief Requests Consolidation of Panama River</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] According to sources close to President Roosevelt, since Germany annexed the Czech Republic, President Roosevelt's policies have become more resolute and decisive than at any time in the past. Events abroad have reduced opposition in the Senate, and the policy of strengthening the "weak decisions" of European democracies will gradually increase. The Chairman of the Senate Labor Committee today sent a proposal to Congress, requesting the continuation of the abolition of the trade agreement with the Czech Republic and requesting Germany to bear the Czech debt to the United States, approximately 165 million US dollars. The Secretary of the Army today urged Congress in the Senate to adopt a proposal to allocate 27.7 million yuan to build another dam in the Panama Canal District. Governor Rettari suggested that the construction of this dam must be able to resist air raids and accommodate the largest ships.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, said after a meeting at the White House that President Roosevelt intends to reintroduce the $5 million "port construction" proposal for Guam. The President does not object to the House of Representatives' cancellation of the item on the defense of Guam in the current naval and air force base bill, but will include Guam in the river port development budget.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Condemn Hitler; The Tone Is Fierce as Never Before; Soviet Newspapers Believe the Situation Is Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] All national capitals are paying close attention to yesterday's events. British newspapers are publishing as much news as possible about the Czech incident, condemning Hitler. The fierceness of their tone is rarely seen in the past. Washington officials refused to comment on the incident. According to sources close to President Roosevelt, the President's serious attention to the European situation is for a reason. It is short-sighted to say that some people in Europe are exaggerating. Former Czech President Benes said that the annexation of the Czech Republic is "a new major crime in the international situation." It will be difficult to obtain peace, order, and tranquility in Europe hereafter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] Pravda said, "The surrender of the Czech Republic has made Germany's threat to Poland and Hungary increasingly serious, creating a crisis of new conflict in the Central European situation." The newspaper also said that this move is sufficient to prove Germany's lack of integrity, and it is also the result of British and French cowardly diplomacy.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Vigilance Against Japanese Treachery</h3>
<p>The Czech Republic has fallen completely due to compromise halfway, and the European situation has become even more critical. In this extremely chaotic international situation, we must step up our vigilance against new Japanese conspiracies!</p>
<p>Comprehensive news from all sides in the past few days proves that Japan does have the intention to intensify its aggression against us by taking advantage of the chaos in Europe. What is particularly important is: (1) Intensifying provocations against the Soviet Union to divert general attention and facilitate its choice of a new path of attack. (2) Intensifying the instigation of traitors to promote "anti-communism" and "peace talks," trying to undermine our internal unity, trying to shake our people's trust in the government and friendly countries such as the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France, and trying to weaken our unified resistance forces, so that we lose the power to continue the resistance. (3) In military terms, due to the current internal and external difficulties of the Japanese army, it is not possible to launch an attack from any front immediately, but it is intensifying preparations for launching a new attack, and their "southwest strategy" is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>In response to this conspiracy tendency of the Japanese, we must intensify the behind-the-scenes activities of Japanese provocations against the Soviet Union, we must intensify our opposition to peace and compromise rhetoric and actions; we must intensify our enthusiastic support for the leader, support for the government, and support for national unity; we must intensify our efforts to unite democratic and peaceful countries to promote the movement to aid China and restrict Japan; we must also intensify our efforts to consolidate the combat effectiveness of the front line, develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and actively cultivate new forces in the rear.</p>
<h3>It Is Rumored That Italy Will Follow Germany in Annexing Yugoslavia; Hitler's Second Target Is to Encircle Memel</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] Since Hitler annexed the Czech Republic, the general psychology of all sectors in London has been dominated by the question of "What will be the second step?" The most common answer is that Germany will make another attempt to move eastward. It is expected that Hitler will sooner or later focus on Poland and Hungary. However, attacking Poland seems too early for the time being. Judging from the situation, its second target seems to be Memel. German leader Neumann, in a speech yesterday on the recent relations between Germany and Lithuania, stated that there are signs of increasing disputes in Memel. However, if Germany hopes to resolve Memel smoothly without conflicting with the United States, France, and Britain, it will be difficult. It is expected here that Italy will also follow Germany's example and come out to do its "dirty work of helping oppressed minorities." If so, Yugoslavia will be unavoidable. Yugoslavia also has ethnic minorities, just as Slovakia is dissatisfied with being dominated by the Czech Republic, Croatia is also equally hostile to Serbia. The Yugoslav government is currently seeking appropriate solutions, but Croatia is still not satisfied. If Croatia shows any sign, Mussolini will not hesitate to repeat the Czech incident in Yugoslavia, creating Croatia's independence and placing it under Italian protection. Moreover, there are German and Hungarian minorities in the country, so its fate will not be difficult to be the same as that of the Czech Republic.</p>
<h3>British Naval Undersecretary's Budget Proposal: Reporting on Ambitious Plans, Adding Over a Hundred Warships; Naval Supremacy Absolutely Must Not Be Lost</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] British Naval Undersecretary Shakespeare stated last night when submitting the naval budget proposal to the House of Commons that the British Royal Navy would add forty-three warships this fiscal year, and a further sixty in 1939. He also announced the ambitious measures taken by the British Navy to avoid the threat of submarine attacks and air raids.</p>
<p>Military Production Difficulties Overcome</p>
<p>The new naval shipbuilding plan includes two high-speed, 40,000-ton battleships, each equipped with 16-inch guns. He stated, "We currently have fifteen large battleships, two or three of which were built after the European War. By 1943, we will have twenty-one large battleships. In these years, naval arsenals and shipyards will build approximately two hundred ships, totaling 870,000 tons, including nine battleships, six aircraft carriers, twenty-five cruisers, forty-three destroyers, nineteen submarines, and several other small warships. During the period of retrenchment after the European War, the production of some factories fell behind, but now difficulties have been overcome, and expanded new factories have been completed and can produce to their full capacity. In the past three years, the production of heavy guns has increased twentyfold. As for the current reserves of guns, mines, depth charges, and ammunition, I dare assure this House that they are sufficient for one year of combat." Speaking of the dangers Britain might encounter in wartime, he stated, "If we lose our naval supremacy, we will only starve to death. We believe that today's British fleet is extremely powerful and capable of meeting the challenge of any possible combined fleet."</p>
<p>Escort Methods Sufficient to Destroy Submarines</p>
<p>The threat of submarines in the future will not be as serious as during the last Great War. We see from the results of statistics that the "convoy" system adopted at the end of the European War was indeed successful. Our Admiralty and shipbuilding industry, after two years of close cooperation, are now able to immediately establish a convoy organization along any necessary route after the outbreak of war. We currently have a large number of weapons for attacking submarines, sufficient for application, with over two thousand pieces immediately available. Within a reasonable period, there will be a large increase. By the end of this year, we can expect to have a thousand merchant ships, all of whose decks will be equipped with weapons. Over nine thousand merchant ship officers are studying the "convoy" curriculum. Once war breaks out, the government will acquire a large number of ships for the navy to attack submarines. I believe the British Navy's methods of searching, detecting, and destroying enemy submarines are the best in the world. In January 1938, Britain announced the sinking of any submarine below the surface to eliminate piracy in the Mediterranean. Since this announcement, no piracy cases have occurred. I wish the members of this House to draw their own conclusions."</p>
<p>Air Defense Equipment on Ships Strengthened</p>
<p>Air raids are another threat to the Navy, but the defensive weapons of modern warships, including short-range and long-range firepower, can prevent aircraft from flying low or can only fly at high altitude, so that the accuracy of their attack targets is seriously affected. British policy is to concentrate modern anti-aircraft guns on warships as much as possible, whether short-range or long-range. The defense equipment of modern warships is excellent and can avoid artillery and bomb attacks. The threat of torpedoes and depth charges has also been greatly reduced due to improvements in underwater defense systems, which are sufficient to avoid serious damage below the water surface. He continued, "Since the Naval Air Arm and the Free Air Division were returned to the Admiralty, there has been progress. Soon the Navy will acquire all the aircraft and reserves of the first line, as well as naval training aircraft. Naval aviation personnel, including those undergoing miscoding, have greatly increased. In 1937, there were only three thousand people, but now there are six thousand. Orders for aircraft to be used for the six aircraft carriers under construction have been placed. The development of aviation has greatly increased the strength of the Navy. The only thing lacking in the Navy is skilled mechanics. The government has taken the necessary steps to train naval officers to command the expanded fleet."</p>
<p>Reserve Personnel Reach 70,000</p>
<p>Shakespeare then answered a question, stating, "Our naval reserve personnel are at least 70,000. Those who have served in the Navy, all 60,000 to 70,000, have reached the age of fifty-five. The training of the Royal Naval Reserve has adopted new methods, with three new divisions starting training in Hull, Cardiff, and Southampton, and necessary steps have been taken to organize anti-aircraft gun training. It is now hoped to organize artillery teams within the reserve, which can be dispatched to the fleet for service when mobilization is ordered. In addition, it is hoped to establish ten naval brigades in the voluntary training naval reserve, whose only obligation is moral, that is, to join the naval service in wartime." Lieutenant Colonel Llewellyn stated, "Regarding the position of the British Navy in the Far East, it is not true that it has been driven out of the Yangtze River. We all know that there are various difficulties there, but usually there are forty gunboats stationed there. It is only right that six of them have sailed to Shanghai for repairs or other tasks. I have heard someone criticize the British Naval Rear Admiral in the Yangtze River area. I would like to swear that the naval officers and sailors in that area have gone through extremely difficult times and have been able to perform their duties. This is all that you expect from the Royal Navy."</p>
<p>British Gunboats Still on the Yangtze</p>
<p>Labor Party MP Alexander stated that he did not criticize naval officers in the Yangtze River area, but only criticized the policies they implemented. He also mentioned the Japanese declaration regarding the reopening of the Yangtze River. Lieutenant Colonel Llewellyn replied, "This is a matter for the Foreign Office, but we still have gunboats stationed on the Yangtze River. These gunboats have done good work in the past and are well-regarded by the people there. I still remember the British Chamber of Commerce in Hankou expressing its gratitude to Rear Admiral Halda."</p>

<h3>× Gift of the Invasion of Southern China! Hong Kong's Trade with China Plummets; Last Month's Trade Volume Drops to One-Tenth of Last Year's; Expected Losses This Year Exceed 200 Million Dollars</h3>
<p>Since ×'s invasion of Southern China, traffic on various rivers has been blocked, and Hong Kong's trade with Southern China has almost come to a standstill. The figures for trade with Southern China in the last three months of last year have all seen a sharp decline. The situation has become even more serious since the beginning of this year. According to the Hong Kong Import and Export Statistics Office, which issued a report yesterday on the month of February, Hong Kong's trade with Southern China has plummeted. If this continues, the commercial losses this year will exceed 200 million. The various intelligence reports are recorded below. According to the report, Hong Kong's exports to Southern China in February were only worth 731,862 yuan, while in February of last year, they were 7,857,930 yuan. This year's figure is only one-tenth of last year's. If we combine the months of January and February, last year it was 18,366,904 yuan, and this year it was 3,067,693 yuan. The huge difference is truly astonishing. As for imports from Southern China, this year's February figure was 4,847,778 yuan, which is 2,600,1895 yuan less than February of last year. The above refers to trade with Southern China in a single month. If we total the export figures for January and February, this year's total is 9,796,198 yuan, while last year's January and February were 20,405,245 yuan, a decrease of 11 million yuan. If we combine import and export trade, there is a decrease of 22,590,8358 yuan. According to the statistics on Hong Kong's rain trade with China in the past few months since ×'s invasion of Southern China, we know that Hong Kong's trade with Southern China is declining. According to reliable sources, if × continues to occupy Southern China and block the waterways, Hong Kong's commercial losses this year will be at least 200 million yuan. Fortunately, trade with other regions can still maintain a considerable level. It is estimated that the total import volume in February this year was 36,824,820 yuan, only 4,574,051 yuan less than February last year. The total export volume was 36,502,007 yuan, which is 1,949,617 yuan less than the same period last year. If Southern China had been peaceful and able to maintain last year's level, then this year's February export trade would have exceeded last year's by 5 million yuan. In addition, the total import and export trade for January and February last year was 180,914,125 yuan, while this year it was 154,171,949 yuan, a decrease of 36,742,176 yuan.</p>
<h3>Mad Leper Woman Sets Fire While Praying to Gods; Shenzhen Refugee Camp Completely Burned Down; Lack of Fire Fighting Equipment Causes Fire to Burn for Five Hours; Refugees Had Already Moved, Fortunately No Casualties; A Shed in a Tsuen Wan Factory Also Caught Fire Yesterday, Losses Exceeding a Thousand Dollars</h3>
<p>The Shenzhen refugee camp, formerly the old sites of Shenzhen Hotel and Yau Ma Tei Theatre, caught fire on the 16th. The fire spread rapidly and was extremely intense. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the reporter personally went to Shenzhen yesterday to investigate. The cause and process of the fire are roughly described below.</p>
<p>Mad Woman Prays to Gods, Summons Fire</p>
<p>It was found that since the refugees moved into British territory last month, only one mad woman, about thirty years old, remained, living in an abandoned wood-covered sampan. The police had inspected and driven her away, but she returned shortly after. On the evening of the 16th, around 8 p.m., the mad woman piled up bamboo and wood scraps behind Shenzhen Theatre, made incense and burned it, prostrated herself and prayed, and then left. At that time, the north wind was strong, and the fire burned the sheds in between, spreading to the entire refugee camp. The fire was so bright that it was impossible to approach. The British territory, including Sheung Shui and Fanling, could also see it from afar.</p>
<p>Police and Customs Officers Rescuing</p>
<p>The police station was located to the left of the Shenzhen Hotel. When the fire was discovered, all the police officers were dispatched to rescue and maintain order to prevent criminals. However, due to the lack of fire-fighting equipment, the fire became more intense. They had no choice but to first dismantle the office of the original refugee camp and the sheds and bamboo fences near the original Red Swastika Society, and water the surrounding houses to prevent them from being affected. At the same time, they telephoned the Sheung Shui Police Station and requested that a fire brigade be sent to fight the fire, but due to various reasons, they could not come. At this time, the Customs also received the news and dispatched a large team of customs officers to assist in the rescue. At the same time, the Shenzhen Rural Cooperative, St. John's Temporary Hospital, and staff from the Railway Party Department all came to help. After 9:30 p.m., the wind direction changed to northeast, so the Children's School, Police Station, Tung Wah Hospital office, Shenzhen Hotel, etc., were not affected. Even the refugee dining hall was intact. The fire gradually subsided after 10 p.m., and was extinguished at 1 a.m. yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Most Houses Burned</p>
<p>After the incident, it was counted that the burned houses included the first, second, and third parts of the refugee dormitory, including the former Sino-Youth Relief Team office, refugee dormitory, kitchen, lighting room, and female restroom. Only a small part, such as the office of the refugee management office, the Chinese office, and the Taiping Bridge male restroom, were not affected. The local refugees had already been evacuated, so there were no casualties. As for the mad woman, the authorities have detained her and interrogated her. It is said that the woman's condition is neurological, and she has confessed to starting the fire. In addition, Xu, acting director of the Central Relief Commission, and officials from the Relief Federation have dispatched personnel to investigate the incident in order to report it truthfully.</p>
<p>Tsuen Wan Sheds Burned Down</p>
<p>Also, at around 3 a.m. yesterday morning, the Kowloon Fire Brigade received a telegram from the Fen Wan Police Station saying that a fire had broken out on Shing Mun Road. After receiving the news, the school immediately dispatched a No. 7 fire engine to fight the fire. The fire was extinguished at around 5 a.m. yesterday morning. It was found that the fire occurred in the workers' dormitory shed of a construction company on Shing Mun Road in Tsuen Wan, which was about 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. At 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the fire broke out for unknown reasons, causing it to be burned down. Fortunately, the workers noticed it early and fled far away from the shed, so there were no casualties. After burning for about two hours, the entire shed was burned down, and the workers' luggage and the shed's losses amounted to over a thousand dollars.</p>
<h3>The Joint Association of Education and Conservation Societies Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Fundraising Methods for Children's Day; It Was Decided to Hold Indoor Flag Presentations and Cash Donations at That Time; The Funds Raised Will Be Used to Set Up a Mechanical Workshop</h3>
<p>This year's April 4th Children's Day is approaching. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Joint Association believes that many refugee children have fled to Hong Kong and urgently need relief and education. It is specifically planned to hold a memorial meeting in theaters in various districts on this day, as well as indoor flag presentations and cash donations to raise funds for relief and education. The association held a talk with the Hong Kong Wartime Children's Conservation Association yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. to discuss fundraising methods for that day and the distribution of the funds raised. As a result of the discussion, it was proposed to allocate all the proceeds to set up a mechanical workshop as a place for the refugee children to study, so that each refugee child can support themselves after graduation. As for the size of the workshop, it will depend on the amount of money raised from the flag presentation that day.</p>
<h3>Four Men Attempted to Rob a Taxi Driver on Pok Fu Lam Road Early Yesterday Morning; Tang Bin Escaped Cleverly, and the Car Was Driven to Aberdeen</h3>
<p>Taxi driver Tang Bin, residing on the fourth floor of No. 447 Hennessy Road, parked his car near Central the night before. Four men, all dressed neatly, boarded the car and asked to go west, but did not state where they were going. Tang drove as ordered. When they drove to Pok Fu Lam Road near the Milk Company, it was 1:15 a.m. yesterday morning. The area was remote and sparsely populated, and unusually quiet. The men in the car suddenly ordered to stop. Tang stopped suddenly. The four men got out of the car in succession, without paying, and surrounded Tang from all sides. Tang, seeing that the situation was not good and fearing that he would be attacked, suddenly jumped out of the car. The four men rushed forward, attempting to capture him and rob him. Tang, unable to defeat them due to their numbers, abandoned the car and ran away wildly. The four men chased him for a while before giving up. Afterwards, Tang went to the Sai Ying Pun Police Station to report the case, describing the situation in detail as above, and said that he speculated that the four men intended to rob him. The police immediately dispatched detectives from the Central and Western Districts to investigate the whereabouts of the bandits and track down the location of taxi No. 409. At the same time, they telephoned the Aberdeen Police Station and sent a team to intercept them. Later, the car was found on the left side of the road in Aberdeen, but the men in the car had disappeared without a trace. The car was driven back to the Sai Ying Pun Police Station, and Tang was summoned to identify it. The case was filed for investigation and arrest of these four villains.</p>
<h3>Great Development of Broadcasting Industry; The Number of Radio Households Now Reaches Over 10,000; An Increase of Over 19 Times Compared to Ten Years Ago; The Number of Short-Term Licenses Issued Also Reaches Over a Hundred</h3>
<p>The broadcasting industry in Hong Kong has made great progress in recent years. In the past ten years, the number of households with radio licenses has increased from over 500 to over 10,000. The progress is truly amazing. Yesterday, the Broadcasting Station released its business report for the past year, which provided a detailed description of the broadcasting industry in Hong Kong. The report stated that as of the end of each year, 10,605 radio licenses have been issued. In order to meet the needs of tourists temporarily residing in Hong Kong, a three-month short-term license was specially set up. The number of such licenses issued also reached 131. In May last year, a new transmitter was installed at the ZE station, specifically broadcasting Chinese programs, so that it can broadcast simultaneously with English programs. The amount of Chinese programs broadcast last year totaled 2,354 hours and 45 minutes. In addition, from April 1 last year, Reuters news messages were translated into Chinese every day and broadcast in Cantonese and Mandarin, which is convenient for residents from the north. In addition, there were many novel programs broadcast last year. At the request of the National Broadcasting Company of the United States, it participated in this year's New Year's Day world broadcasting program through the American Broadcasting Network. This move has achieved quite satisfactory results. As for the number of licenses issued by this station in the past ten years, they are as follows: 545 in 1929, 1,596 in 1930, 1,788 in 1931, 2,466 in 1932, 3,278 in 1933, 4,201 in 1934, 5,104 in 1935, 7,036 in 1936, 8,539 in 1937, and 10,605 in 1938. The broadcasting time for English programs on ZBW broadcasting station is 2,601 hours and 45 minutes, and the broadcasting time for English programs on ZEK is 100 hours and 45 minutes. The broadcasting time for Chinese programs is 204 hours and 15 minutes on ZBW station, and 2,354 hours and 45 minutes on ZEK station. The current list of all members of the station is as follows: Rong Zongshi (Chairman), Zhou Junnian, Liao Yali Ma Da, Qi Dachen, Lai Fu, Morris, Bintelifu, Light Raigent Pastor, Sik Ling, Deckergu, Cao Junan.</p>
<h3>Dissection of the New Central Market</h3>
<p>— Aspiration</p>
<p>If a clean and modern market is a perfect symbol of the city's excellent or advanced sanitary administration, then Hong Kong's vigorous construction or reconstruction of markets in recent years is worthy of showing off. Like the Central Market, which is scheduled to open in early May this year, few can add such fresh lustre to Hong Kong's sanitary administration achievements!</p>
<p>This market was still an old building of several decades a few years ago, dark, dirty, and with a fishy smell permeating from the inside, causing everyone who walked past its door to hold their breath and rush past. I am afraid this situation will no longer exist! It has now become a new and clean large building, and people passing by its door at this time are looking at it with "new eyes."</p>
<p>The construction of this new market not only takes into account the convenience of transactions for both vendors and customers, but I believe that no other market in the world is as particular about public health as this one.</p>
<p>This market has four floors, and its exterior is edged with delicate green beauty, which can well express its internal cleanliness. Yes, its interior is inlaid with milky white magnetic tiles, which is easiest for washing work. The current plan is to make the top floor the Cleanliness Bureau and staff offices, and the remaining three floors are used for trading places. It is estimated that there are fifty fish stalls and forty-five chicken and duck stalls in the basement. Behind each fish stall is a scientific double-layered fish pond. The chicken and duck stalls have facilities for slaughtering and a small storage for chicken and duck feed. On the second floor, there are fifty pork stalls and thirty beef stalls. On the third floor, there are fruit stalls and vegetable stalls, the former occupying fifty and the latter occupying thirty.</p>
<p>The stalls here are all for retail trade, and wholesale business will be left to the Kennedy Town Market. However, in terms of transportation, I will not forget to tell the reader that it has four large entrances. The south faces Queen's Road and the north faces Des Voeux Road. These two entrances are for customers to enter and exit. As for the west side Caine Road and the east side Wellington Street, there is a horizontal door for goods to enter and exit, and the platform in Eastern District is designed to facilitate car unloading. The car also has a very large ladder that can accommodate twenty people. This elevator is located next to the north Dou Kongdao.</p>
<p>In short, the entire market is a new type of building. In terms of hygiene, trading convenience, and even city appearance, it can add a lot of luster to Hong Kong. In terms of management, the Hong Kong government wants to thank the Municipal Health Bureau, and in terms of design, it is attributed to the engineer Hershes of the Public Works Department. In the pouring of cement engineering, the engineer Warnor is promoted, and the piling project and decoration are carried out by the Wen Hualu Company and De Xing Company. The other changes in the social scene of the Hong Kong Society during the new transition of this market cannot be ignored, and this change is also quite chain-linked with commerce. So, let's recall that two years ago, when this market was demolished, its meat and fish stalls were all moved to the Sheung Wan Market. As a result, the original fish stalls in the Sheung Wan Market were forced to move to the Western District, and the vegetable stalls were forced to move to Hollywood Road. Later, many newly opened fruit shops were found on Market Road and Avenue Middle.</p>
<p>Now, the new Central Market is about to open. We can all imagine doing a "restored" cycle according to the above-mentioned transformation method!</p>
<h3>Relieving the Grain Shortage; Hong Kong Rice Merchants Plan; Transporting Foreign Rice Back to Guangdong; A Large Amount of Grain Has Been Ordered from Annam and Siam; Cooperating with Industry Peers in Australia and Mainland</h3>
<p>The rice shortage in Chaozhou, Shantou, Panyu, Zhongshan and the Five Districts is now becoming increasingly acute. The authorities of various counties and the overseas Chinese groups from various counties in Hong Kong are all disturbed and are trying to find ways to provide relief. On the one hand, they are repeatedly sending telegrams to the central government to request exemption from import tax on foreign rice, and on the other hand, they are actively raising funds to purchase large quantities of foreign rice to return to the various rice-deficient areas in the mainland to hold fair sales, so as to save the tens of millions of people who are about to become starving people from falling into hunger and cold. Yesterday, according to news from the Hong Kong Central Rice Trade Association, the relief of the rice shortage in various counties in the mainland cannot be delayed, and it is also a good opportunity to develop the industry. Therefore, under the rush of various overseas Chinese groups, people in the industry have also risen up to plan to take the opportunity to transport a large amount of foreign rice back to the mainland for sale, hoping to quickly replenish the rice supply in various counties, so that it will not be taken advantage of by one or two profiteers to manipulate and profit, and to give the general public great pain. Regarding the promotion of this plan, it has now been decided to handle the entire steps separately. First, personnel will be dispatched during the day to Macau and the important cities in the Five Districts to contact industry peers there to implement cooperation and plan to promote foreign rice sales, hoping to make a considerable contribution to the food of the people in the mainland. At the same time, they will also consult with the authorities of various counties, so that they can get some help in transportation and reduce various obstacles and difficulties.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is planned that the Macau industry association will jointly consult with the leaders of the Macau overseas Chinese groups to the Macau authorities, requesting permission to transport foreign rice through Macau in the future and to handle it with flexibility. On the other hand, it will begin to order a large amount of grain from Annam, Siam and other places to be transported back to Hong Kong and transferred to the mainland in batches. In the past few days, several large rice shops have sent telegrams to Annam and Siam to order a considerable amount of grain, preparing to start transporting it in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the National Salvation United Front: Unite All Hong Kong Women! The Women's Four Associations Will Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss Expanding the Organization</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, various women's national salvation associations in Hong Kong have been established one after another. However, due to various reasons, they have been isolated from each other, and there have been few opportunities for connection, which has caused much inconvenience in carrying out work. At the March 8th International Women's Day commemoration meeting, Ms. He Xiangning publicly proposed that the women's groups present immediately establish the Hong Kong Women's United Congress. The Hong Kong Comforting Branch also sent a letter to the Women's Four Associations yesterday, proposing to expand the organization of the Four Associations, include various women's groups in Hong Kong and China, and establish the Hong Kong Women's Joint Council. Since the announcement of this news, people from all walks of life have paid extraordinary attention. Yesterday, our reporter specially interviewed the persons in charge of the Four Women's Associations and various women's groups in Hong Kong to inquire about their attitudes towards this matter. According to the responsible persons of the Four Women's Associations, they all agreed with this proposal. The remaining women's groups warmly supported this move. It is learned that the Four Associations have scheduled a meeting for 11:00 AM today at the Women's War Relief Association to conduct a thorough discussion and prepare to pass the adoption, and to send letters to various women's groups that have not yet joined, inviting them to join. It is learned that the groups that have not yet joined include the Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association, the China Women's Thrift Association's Chinese Business Branch, the South China Athletic Association Women's Department, the Tao Hua Da Tong Trade Union, the Ap Lei Chau Women's Disaster Relief Association, the Chen Guang Society, the Hong Kong Kowloon Women's Advancement Association, the Yu Xian Le Society Women's Department, etc. It is learned that the above-mentioned women's groups include industry, commerce, academia, and agriculture, with a total of more than 15,000 people.

<h3>Smuggling Is Becoming Increasingly Rampant: Open Armed Smuggling, Equipping Firearms and Running Rampant on the Hong Kong Border, Smuggling Large Quantities of Tungsten Sand, Raw Silk, Etc. from the Mainland to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>As the coastline of Guangdong extends, and due to its relationship with British-ruled Hong Kong, smuggling activities are particularly rampant. Especially after the outbreak of the war in South China and the fall of Guangzhou, the customs offices in the war zone have been abolished, and many coastal ports have also been destroyed by gunfire, making it impossible to handle official business. Therefore, smugglers generally regard this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and become even more rampant, openly engaging in armed smuggling, transporting goods back and forth between Hong Kong and the mainland in an endless stream, running rampant without restraint, and significantly affecting national tax revenue.</p>
<p>A Shortcut for Smuggling on the Shenzhen River</p>
<p>At present, there are many smuggling routes in South China, the most prominent of which is the Baojia County border between China and Britain. Baoan is adjacent to the New Territories, separated only by a deep river. The river is shallow in the upper reaches and can be crossed on foot. In the past, smuggling on this route was already very rampant. Smugglers generally take advantage of the slight negligence of the guards during the night to secretly cross the Shenzhen River from the Baoan side and enter British territory. Even if our customs officers and military police discover it afterwards, they have no way to pursue and arrest them. It is estimated that the most smuggled goods to Hong Kong are sand, followed by raw salt, tobacco, and alcohol. As for the goods smuggled from Hong Kong to the mainland, they are kerosene, sugar, and foreign goods.</p>
<p>Armed Entry and Exit, Running Rampant</p>
<p>Recently, smugglers have become increasingly fierce, openly equipped with firearms, and smuggling openly. Sometimes there are no less than twenty or thirty guns, and at least ten or eight guns. Sometimes, even if discovered by customs officers, they are not afraid, and will shoot back if necessary. The audacity of these smugglers is evident. It is reported that most of these smugglers are bandits and local bullies, and many are scattered soldiers. Many of the firearms they use are from the hands of the (text missing) army, so they can run rampant without restraint.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Raw Silk Smuggled to Hong Kong</p>
<p>As for the Pearl River Basin, Zhongshan, Puhai, Shunde, and Dongguan counties are also channels for smugglers to enter and exit. If the places they pass through are occupied areas, they obtain passage permits from the Guangzhou (text missing) military authorities and the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong, and use small boats to transport goods through the occupied areas to the outer sea of Lingdingyang, where they are transferred to barges and transported to Hong Kong. The goods smuggled from Hong Kong to the mainland are transported by civilian ships to the vicinity of Lingdingyang, where they are transferred to small boats and transported to the mainland for sale. It is learned that the most smuggled goods from this area are raw silk from Shunde. It is learned that the current price of raw silk in the mainland is only HK$100 per picul, while the selling price in Hong Kong is over HK$300. The depth of the profit can be imagined.</p>
<p>Tungsten Sand and Salt Smuggled Continuously</p>
<p>In addition, there is another route for smuggling goods to Hong Kong, which is the Hailufeng County of eastern Guangdong. This area is close to Hong Kong's territorial waters, making entry and exit convenient. Moreover, most of the local customs posts have been destroyed by (text missing) military artillery and no longer exist. Therefore, smuggling is also very serious. The most smuggled goods from Shanwei in this area to Hong Kong are tungsten sand and salt. Smugglers generally move the goods to ships at night, hoist their sails, and transport them to Hong Kong. The goods transported from Hong Kong to that area are mostly daily necessities and foreign goods.</p>
<h3>Special Horse Racing Today: The First Race Starts at 2 PM, with a Total of Nine Races</h3>
<p>After the end of the Spring Horse Racing Meeting, there has been a two-week break. Today, the first special horse racing will be held at Happy Valley, starting at 2:00 PM, with a total of nine races. If the weather can be sunny, it is believed that the excitement will be almost the same as during the main meeting. However, affected by the heavy rain in the past few days, the overall time for the horses to race will definitely not be too fast, and it may not be easy to create a new record. There are a total of thirteen special horse races this year, six in the first half of the year until June, and seven in the second half of the year until December. Five of today's nine races are for unwanted horses, limited to horses that have not won once in the main meeting. The remaining four races are handicap races for new and old horses. After this race, the Jockey Club will classify the horses according to their performance. Chinese horses will still be classified into five classes, and Australian horses will still be classified into three classes. The program for future special horse races will mainly be handicap races. It seems that this year's new horses are mostly formidable fellows. When they are mixed with old horses for racing, it will be even more interesting and exciting.</p>
<h3>Many People Still Come South to Make a Living: Singapore Ship Tickets Rise to $200, Cargo Ship Tickets Also Rise to $180</h3>
<p>In recent years, many Chinese workers have gone to Singapore and its dependencies to make a living, and have not been significantly affected by the sluggish local rubber and tin industries and the large number of unemployed people. In order to maintain unemployed workers, the Singapore authorities issued a series of orders last year restricting the import of Chinese workers, stipulating that no more than 500 new male and female passengers should enter the country each month. However, this is still not enough to curb the influx of Chinese workers. Each month, the number of people leaving Hong Kong for Southeast Asia still exceeds the quota, and there are still countless people who have obtained exit permits and are waiting for ships to go south. As a result, businessmen involved in this matter recognize this as an opportunity to make money, and ship ticket prices have repeatedly risen, breaking all previous records. It is learned that Singapore passenger tickets are cheap, and the shipping company originally set the price at $80 per ticket. Due to the restrictions on entry by the Singapore authorities and the large number of people going south, and at the same time, some people are manipulating the situation, the price has repeatedly soared. Recently, the market price has reached over $200, setting an unprecedented high. In addition to passenger ships, cargo ships between Hong Kong and Singapore, which have more than a dozen passenger seats, have recently seen many Chinese workers taking advantage of the lower prices due to the rise in passenger ticket prices. Cargo ship passenger tickets, which have never had a fixed price, have also recently seen a rise to over $180 per ticket due to the large number of people switching to cargo ships. Due to the small number of passenger seats, supply and demand do not meet, and purchase is also extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong News Briefs</h3>
<p>Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, received a donation of HK$1,000 from overseas Chinese in Sandakan a month ago to subsidize the China Defense League. Madame Sun believed that refugees in various places were displaced, so she specially handed over the total amount to the Relief Federation for the relief of refugees.</p>
<p>The charity ball and dance organized by the Women's Comfort Association is now scheduled to be held at the Hotel Metropole on the afternoons of March 31st and April 1st. It is said that the entertainment program at this charity ball and dance is extraordinarily rich.</p>
<p>The China Youth Relief Association has scheduled a general membership meeting for 2:00 PM on Sunday at Ling Dao Girls' Middle School to discuss the organization of a return-to-China military service team, the 'Review' and 'Training' Committee, and the progress of the research committee's singing class and symposium.</p>
<p>He Hing Peanut Oil is manufactured in a grand factory built by itself on Castle Peak Road in Kowloon. The raw materials are all purchased high-quality peanuts. After production, the latest machines separate and seal them in cans. It is pure, hygienic, nourishing, and rich. Since its promotion, food merchants such as liquor stores and restaurants have adopted it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cotton Yarn Shipped to Hong Kong for Mixed Sales: Many Factories Adopted the Practice of Shipping It Under Altered Trademarks; The Manufacturers Association Has Stopped Signing Certificates of Origin</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's cotton yarn was repurchased from the United Kingdom, Japan, and Shanghai. Since Central China became a war zone and the United Kingdom amended its preferential tariff rules, the amount of Japanese and Shanghai cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong decreased significantly last autumn. However, it has recently shown signs of recovery. According to industrial sources, a large amount of Japanese cotton yarn is being shipped to Hong Kong for sale under altered trademarks in Shanghai. Due to its low price, many weaving factories here have adopted this practice. The reporter further learned that some cotton textile manufacturers have been obtaining certificates of origin from the Manufacturers Association in recent years in order to ship and sell their products to various ports in Southeast Asia. However, the association recently announced that it would temporarily stop issuing them. It is rumored that the Chinese Manufacturers Association is also taking similar steps, but the association authorities deny this. However, when obtaining a certificate, it is necessary to have an inspector check and approve it, and it must be signed by the chairman. According to sources familiar with the matter, it is currently difficult to distinguish the source of cotton yarn, which is mixed. It is believed that the reason for stopping the issuance of certificates of origin is based on this.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Southern Guangdong Has Become Stable; (Japanese) Warships Still Cruise and Spy Along the Coast; The People's Strength Is Sufficient, and the (Japanese) Dare Not Act Rashly; Six or Seven (Japanese) Warships Shuttle Back and Forth Along the Coast</h3>
<p>[Southern Guangdong Quick Report] After the (Japanese) invaded Hainan Island, (Japanese) warships in the coastal waters of southern Guangdong moved to Leizhou to spy along the coast. For a time, it was rumored that the (Japanese) would land in Leizhou, so the situation in southern Guangdong became increasingly tense. However, since the military authorities strengthened the defense of southern Guangdong and various counties mobilized the people to fight, the (Japanese) knew that our strength to defend the territory was sufficient and did not dare to act rashly, so the situation has become more stable. In the past ten days, (Japanese) warships have been discovered in various counties along the coast of southern Guangdong from time to time, but they come and go不定, so it is impossible to count their exact number. The following is a summary of information received from various sources in recent days: (1) In the Fangcheng area, two (Japanese) warships are anchored in the Qisha sea area. There were originally two in the Bailongwei sea area. At 4:00 PM on the 10th, a (Japanese) warship with two smokestacks suddenly increased, but there was no unusual movement. (2) In the Beihai area, three (Japanese) warships were anchored in the Guantouling sea area on the afternoon of the 10th. By 7:00 AM on the 11th, all of them had sailed away. There are currently no traces of (Japanese) warships in the nearby sea area. (3) (Japanese) warships still cruise back and forth along the coast of Xuwen from time to time. Three (Japanese) warships were discovered in the Haian sea area on the afternoon of the 12th and immediately sailed east. At present, only six or seven (Japanese) warships are anchored along the coast of Xuwen, all of which are of a patrolling nature, and there is no large-scale invasion action.</p>
<h3>(Japanese) Will Send Matsui to Southern Guangdong to Mediate; (Japanese) Army and Navy Fight Internally; Actively Plan Southern Invasion to Eliminate Internal Conflicts; Our Authorities Have Received Reports and Have Ordered Strict Prevention</h3>
<p>[Northern Guangdong Quick Report] The (Japanese) army invading Southern Guangdong has made no progress in the northeastern, western, and western routes after more than four months. Internally, they are threatened by our guerrilla teams, their soldiers are old and tired, and the army and navy are flaunting each other, jealous of each other's merits, and therefore hate each other, resulting in internal conflicts. The (Japanese) chieftain Ando is helpless and telegraphed the General Staff to find a way to mediate and suppress the situation. According to reports from (Japanese) country, Matsui Iwane was dispatched to Southern Guangdong to mediate and suppress the situation. This news has been very noisy recently. According to military news obtained from a certain agency, Matsui indeed took a ship secretly from Shanghai on the 6th of this month, twice convened the invading (Japanese) army, navy, and air force generals, held military meetings, and in addition to instructing new strategies for invasion, he also tried his best to mediate and suppress the internal disputes of the (Japanese) army, navy, and air force. He stayed in Guangdong for several days and was accompanied by Ando to inspect the lines in Guangdong Province and Hainan Island. The content of this meeting is very secret, but according to the investigation by various spies, the main points are: (1) Decide to implement a sweeping policy, with several regiments responsible for completely suppressing our local guerrilla teams to avoid threats and constraints and to stabilize the occupied areas to promote the puppet regime. (2) Increase the strength of the troops in the northwest and east routes, consolidate the defenses of each point and line, so that they can attack when advancing and defend when retreating, and wait for the opportunity to stop advancing. (3) Actively promote the military affairs of Hainan Island, and strive to occupy the entire island in the spring to complete its ideal Pacific military base. For the military affairs of each route, if necessary, do not hesitate to risk expanding the Southern Guangdong military operations to end the war in Southern Guangdong. The above three points are military issues, and there are also discussions on other economic invasions, roughly increasing the transport of (Japanese) goods to Guangdong, establishing factories and households, manufacturing and dumping as much as possible, and implementing economic aggression. After receiving this news, our military authorities have ordered their subordinates to take strict precautions.</p>
<h3>Most (Japanese) Soldiers Are Against the War; They Surrender or Defect One After Another; More Than Eighty (Japanese) Soldiers Mutinied in Shiwan; (Japanese) Chieftains Are Helpless About the Problem of (Japanese) Soldiers' War Weariness</h3>
<p>[Nanhai Quick Report] The (Japanese) army stationed at the Shiwan Taoist Temple in Nanhai, including a group of about one hundred Taiwanese and Korean soldiers, suddenly mutinied a few days ago due to lack of food and unpaid pay. The (Japanese) military police in Foshan dispatched a team to execute the ringleaders. Recently, it has been found that since the (Japanese) army in Foshan experienced a mutiny by Taiwanese and Korean soldiers, they have paid close attention to the actions of Taiwanese and Korean soldiers and have been under strict surveillance. Recently, Taiwanese and Korean soldiers have been prohibited from asking for leave to go out in groups of three or five. It has also been found that the (Japanese) army has always treated Taiwanese and Korean (Japanese) soldiers and Northeastern puppet soldiers very harshly. Recently, Taiwanese and Korean soldiers and Northeastern puppet soldiers fighting in Guangdong have been weary of war due to lack of food and pay. Recently, some have sincerely surrendered to our guerrilla teams, and there have also been many who have defected to resist the (Japanese). At present, the (Japanese) chieftains in Foshan have no other way to control the problem of Taiwanese and Korean soldiers' war weariness except for strict surveillance. It has also been heard that the eighty Taiwanese and Korean soldiers who mutinied in Shiwan a few days ago and were intercepted by the (Japanese) military police were escorted back to the Guangzhou (Japanese) military police headquarters for interrogation on the 12th and are now imprisoned at the old site of the Japanese military school in Shahe awaiting execution.</p>
<h3>The Movement of the (Japanese) Army in Sanshui; Add Construction Works at the End of the Old Sanshui Cape; 700 (Japanese) Soldiers Transferred to Hekou</h3>
<p>[Xijiang Quick Report] The recent movements of the (Japanese) army in Sanshui are as follows:</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>The (Japanese) army in Hekou, Sanshui, has continued to increase in recent days. Yesterday (14th), six or seven hundred infantry and artillery soldiers were transferred from Guangzhou to Hekou, along with twelve steel cannons, twenty-two light machine guns, and forty or fifty military technicians, distributed in Hekou, Sanshui. A wooden bridge was added to the Hekou pier to facilitate lotus transport.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The (Japanese) soldiers in the old Sanshui Village and Jiaowei area have continued to increase by two or three hundred people, building fortifications. They are currently stationed in the old Sanshui area, about 2,000 meters away from our army's sentry posts. Yesterday (14th) morning at about 8:00, about 70 or 80 (Japanese) soldiers opened two electric boats from Hekou, landed in the old Sanshui Village, and sent more than 20 soldiers to harass the village. More than 20 people were building fortifications on the side of the old Sanshui Village. Among the more than 200 (Japanese) soldiers from Hekou to the old Sanshui Village, half are engineers.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, about 100 (Japanese) soldiers from the (Japanese) army of Matsuo opened three electric boats from Xinlu and went to the old Sanshui area to guard. At about 11:00 AM, a (Japanese) officer and an interpreter (that is, a translator) led more than 20 (Japanese) soldiers from Xinlu to Jiaowei and gathered villagers in the old Sanshui Village to discuss matters such as compiling household numbers and issuing good citizen certificates. At 2:30 PM, the (Japanese) sent fifty or sixty people to guard in the Sanzhurong area, set up canvas tents, and requisitioned our original telephone lines for the purpose of drawing trenches. The rest retreated to the old Sanshui.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th at 10:30 AM, more than 100 (Japanese) soldiers stationed in Mumian opened machine guns and fired at our Zao Gang area. We also returned fire with machine guns. It stopped after about half an hour. We suffered no losses. At 12:20 PM at noon, seven (Japanese) planes flew to the Zao Gang Qingqi area to bomb, dropping two bombs, killing and injuring several villagers.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Women Soldiers Completed Training in Lian County; Each Team Member Possesses Excellent Tactics; Now Changed the Number to the Women's Work Corps</h3>
<p>[Lian County Quick Report] Before Guangzhou was lost, the National Army Training Association had concentrated women soldiers from the entire city to implement military training. There were 800 women soldiers who had received considerable training, including young ladies from boudoirs, female workers from restaurants and teahouses, and technicians from women's hair salons, all of whom were able to stand on the front line of the War of Resistance and received strict military training. When Guangzhou was lost, most of them still retreated with the army to the area between Xijiang Guangning Gushui. They were incorporated by the Xijiang Eight Counties Guerrilla Headquarters and renamed the Eight Counties Women's Guerrilla Team. At that time, about 500 people were incorporated. They continued to train guerrilla tactics in the Gushui area. Each team member can display the best tactics. Later, due to the cold climate in Xijiang, more than 40 team members suffered from illnesses and were discharged from the army. Now this group of women soldiers, led by regiment commander Chen Mingshu, has traveled from Gushui to Lian County to listen to training. There are a total of 400 people who arrived in Lian County this time. They were warmly welcomed by all walks of life when they arrived in Lian County. They have now changed their number to the Women's Work Corps and will engage in replenishment in Lian County before being sent to Shaoguan and various townships to guide women's wartime organization.</p>
<h3>The Movement of (Japanese) Aircraft and (Japanese) Warships in the Chaoshan Sea Area</h3>
<p>[Shantou Communication] No air raid sirens have been issued in Shantou City for two days. Yesterday, the 14th, at 2:35 PM, a (Japanese) aircraft took off from the sea, circled once over Nan'ao, and then flew diagonally into the high altitude of Shantou City. It did not drop bombs when passing by and flew towards Chaoyang Guangao. It went through Haimen Longtoushan, spying on Chaoyang County. In the Houxi area of Chaoyang, it dropped four bombs, mistakenly thinking that the open-air shed factory was guarded by troops. The bombs landed in the open space and caused no damage. After three o'clock, they fled to the national border. In recent days, the Chaoshan Sea area has been calm. There are very few (Japanese) warships coming and going. On the evening of the 14th, a (Japanese) destroyer was discovered on Longtoushan, Chaoyang, sailing from east to west. There was no unusual movement.</p>
<h3>The Third District Commissioner's Office Strictly Investigates Unscrupulous Merchants Who Manipulate Finance</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Quick Report] The invasion of (Japanese) is doing everything possible. Recently, they have attempted to disrupt our finances, instigate traitors to infiltrate the mainland, incite the people to discount national currency at low prices, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to manipulate the situation. There are even corrupt financial personnel who have taken the opportunity to squeeze out expenses. Li Leifu, the administrative commissioner of the Third District, has found that the ratio of national currency to cent banknotes in each county under his jurisdiction has mostly fallen to between 1:35 and 1:40. It is not uncommon for traitors and gangsters to be used by (Japanese) in an attempt to undermine national finance, which is extremely hateful. A ban is reiterated that the ratio of legal tender to cent banknotes must be uniformly implemented in accordance with the regulations, and that private discounting and high prices are not allowed. In order to prevent them from disobeying in secret, he has ordered each county to send personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time. Once the facts are verified, they will be punished severely on charges of undermining finance. As for the various institutions under his jurisdiction, if there is a situation of fabricating names and discounting national currency at low prices, the people are allowed to report at any time in order to warn against illegal activities.</p>
<h3>Special Shipping News</h3>

<h3>A Visit to New Tamsui (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fu Ran</p>
<p>(4) Those Who Sink, Defeatists</p>
<p>In this turbulent era, the brave, determined, and politically aware Guomindang members are constantly advancing. However, the timid, wavering, and those with a vague understanding become pessimistic, despairing, and cry in confusion before this great era, losing their courage to fight. Not to mention the general public, even among the youth, we often find such dregs of the times. They are pessimistic, they run away, they treat their jobs as idols, they use pre-death revelry to numb themselves, they consider themselves as not fitting in with the times, wanting to sink downwards, they are defeatists. This is a serious problem during this important period of the War of Resistance, causing a massive depletion of resistance forces.</p>
<p>Increasing New Strength on the Foundation of Victory, Overcoming New Difficulties</p>
<p>In summary, we can reach this conclusion: Tamsui is breaking through to a new path. However, on this new path, there are many difficulties hindering it. Undoubtedly, if we do not overcome the current difficulties with the greatest effort, the new Tamsui cannot grow.</p>
<p>(1) Placing Armed Work First</p>
<p>The situation is tense. Those engaged in national salvation work should place armed work in the first position, raising the slogan of "everything is for resisting Japan, for organizing the armed forces of the people." Mobilize members of the Comrade Association to participate in armed organizations, and implement strict political education and military training under the unified name of the Social Training Corps.</p>
<p>(2) Consolidating and Expanding the Organization of the District Anti-Japanese Comrade Association</p>
<p>Although the People's Anti-Japanese Comrade Association now has more than 10,000 members, it is still not enough. The district association has not been established, and many township branches are just starting. The district government should assist the support association in preserving and promoting its valuable work experience, and earnestly consolidate and expand it, organizing it extensively and deeply.</p>
<p>(3) Intensifying the Work of Eliminating Traitors</p>
<p>Expand and consolidate the traitor-punishment committee affiliated with the support association and the traitor-apprehension teams of the various township anti-Japanese comrade associations, announce regulations for punishing traitors, and universally discuss the issue of eliminating traitors in various mass meetings, and clear out the Tamsui puppet Security Maintenance Association.</p>
<p>(4) Intensifying the Establishment of an Intelligence Network</p>
<p>In addition to reorganizing and adding telephone services, township Comrade Associations should also intensify the establishment of relay outposts and communication teams to transmit accurate intelligence from various locations.</p>
<p>(5) Closely Linking District Administration and National Salvation</p>
<p>District administration work and national salvation work not only cannot be separated but must also be closely linked because politics and national salvation are the same thing. The development of politics and the development of national salvation should be coordinated. To put it plainly, all national salvation organizations, such as the Anti-Japanese Comrade Association, the Anti-Japanese Support Association, the Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps, the Rescue Team, the Social Training Corps... should assist the development and consolidation of district administration as much as possible. Similarly, the district government should also provide mutual assistance as much as possible.</p>
<p>(6) Implementing a Grand Alliance</p>
<p>Political newcomers and those engaged in national salvation work should urgently change their past practices, actively strive for alliances with gentry, celebrities, and people from all levels and classes, striving for their guidance and assistance in work, and mutually supervise and encourage each other under the principle of mutual assistance and concession, developing in a balanced way.</p>
<p>(7) Consolidating Lower-Level Organizations</p>
<p>The district government should earnestly consolidate the organization of the pao-chia (neighborhood units) in each township, and the support association should earnestly consolidate the organization of each Comrade Association, so that the lower-level organizations can truly implement all the tasks of politics and national salvation on the same front, so that actions are unified and responses are interconnected.</p>
<p>Final Few Words</p>
<p>New Tamsui is progressing, but heavy difficulties lie ahead of New Tamsui. Those who should be responsible for resolving these difficulties are not only those engaged in national salvation work, and not only district government personnel, but all the people of Tamsui. Moreover, those engaged in national salvation work and district government personnel alone cannot resolve them no matter how hard they try! We must rely on the power of all the people of Tamsui.</p>
<p>Here, we would like to pay our respects to the work of those engaged in national salvation work and district government personnel in Tamsui. However, we hope even more that they will not succumb to the difficulties, and that they will fight well for the anti-Japanese national united front. Furthermore, we hope that all the people of Tamsui will think about the future of Tamsui and the future of the nation during this difficult time of the War of Resistance, abandoning narrow-minded ideas, letting go of prejudices, and uniting together. "Unity is victory."</p>
<p>Tamsui is the frontline facing the river. I have described the outline of this new Tamsui, not just to make people understand her posture. I am hoping that New Tamsui can strive for victory on the basis of progress, and hoping that enthusiastic compatriots can pay special attention to her progress and help her progress.</p>

<p>Movies and Theater</p>
<h3>New Trends Among Shanghai Moviegoers:  Talks Given by Cinema Managers</h3>
<p>Recently, in order to find out the Shanghai moviegoers’ preferences, dislikes, and general attitudes, the Shanghai Continental Daily visited managers of various major cinemas. The news obtained can be introduced to readers.</p>
<p>Favorite Male Star is Errol Flynn</p>
<p>Among Hollywood male stars, Shanghai moviegoers currently like Errol Flynn the most. The movies he starred in, “Robin Hood” and “Dawn Patrol,” were the most popular. Following Errol Flynn, Shanghai moviegoers expressed their preference for Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, and William Powell.</p>
<p>Favorite Female Star is Deanna Durbin</p>
<p>Among Hollywood female stars, just like Errol Flynn, the most popular with Shanghai moviegoers is Deanna Durbin. The Asian Cinema Company printed 10,000 photos of Deanna Durbin, but within three days, everyone had asked for them.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple is Also Still Strong</p>
<p>In recent years, Hollywood has been predicting the decline of Shirley Temple. However, as far as Shanghai moviegoers are concerned, they still welcome this child star as before. It is said that whenever a film starring her is released, it will definitely be full. Therefore, a cinema manager stated that Shirley Temple's box office performance in Shanghai has not declined.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer Remains Popular</p>
<p>Norma Shearer, especially after the public screening of "Marie Antoinette," is particularly loved by Shanghai moviegoers.</p>
<p>"Snow White" is the Most Popular</p>
<p>In addition, Hollywood film companies generally use great scenes to produce magnificent blockbusters. According to a cinema manager, the length of a film's run depends on this point. Films with great scenes and magnificent settings will definitely have their runs extended. In the past year, the most popular film among Shanghai audiences was "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." Even in second-run cinemas, it was shown five times a day, and each show was packed with audiences, with many people being turned away at the door. The second most popular film behind "Snow White" was "Robin Hood." In terms of the producer's profit, the latter actually exceeded the former.</p>
<p>New Trends in Chinese Films</p>
<p>Regarding Chinese films, one manager pointed out that the popularity of historical films also has its reasons. Under the current tense situation, only this type of typical film can be unobstructed. Compared to current films, they are less subject to censorship. The main reason is the attitude of the producers, who believe that a film will not make money if it encounters obstacles during censorship. Therefore, they no longer produce films that will be censored. Most of the films that are censored are afraid of offending "certain countries" when they are publicly screened in the complex city of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Problem of Charlie Chaplin's New Film</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the problem of Charlie Chaplin's new film, cinema managers cannot predict whether this film will be publicly screened in Shanghai in the future. However, they all affirmed that Charlie Chaplin has always been welcomed by Chinese audiences. Chaplin's films, and those co-starring Laurel and Hardy, can always get good box office results. As for the issue of Laurel and Hardy splitting up, one manager believes that after the split, Laurel should join Chaplin's team. They are both comedians and should work together. Chaplin's new film will feature him speaking for the first time on the screen. The reason he avoided speaking before was because he thought his language was too refined and not suitable for his cane. But now, in his film depicting dictators, it is naturally more appropriate for him to speak the language of "educated" people.</p>
<h3>Public Performance of Anti-Japanese Entertainment in the Guerrilla Zone of Suburban Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the westward withdrawal of the National Army, important points and lines in various counties in the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Shanghai, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Baoshan, Jiading, and Songjiang, successively fell under the iron heels of the Japanese army. However, most of the political power is still under the control of our mobile troops. It is reported that the Shanghai suburban guerrillas, in addition to occasionally attacking Japanese strongholds using the method of making a feint in the east and attacking in the west, have specially organized an anti-Japanese mobile theater troupe to perform anti-Japanese dramas in order to increase the anti-Japanese sentiment and spirit of the people in the guerrilla zone. The troupe is headed by Mr. Li, and the actors are all selected young patriots who love art. Their debut drama, "Thieves of Peace," has been completed and is currently being actively rehearsed and will soon be performed in rotation in various towns and villages.</p>
<h3>Silver Flower</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Hollywood dance instructor Le Roy Prinz, whose life's work is selecting and training women for the screen, said, "If you want to know a woman's identity and character, you don't need to take her to an astrologer or a palm reader. Just look at her legs and you can tell. If a woman has long kneecaps, she will definitely be not only amorous and considerate, but also loyal and reliable. You can also see a woman's character in the way she walks. Smart and sophisticated women lift their legs high when they walk. Women with confidence and boldness must have an unrestrained attitude when they walk. Coy women walk with timid and unsteady steps. Frivolous and lazy women often walk with uneven, suddenly long and suddenly short steps. Women with hard knees definitely have a strong character. This is my experience. If you don't believe me, you can try it."</p>
<p>Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine, don't let their faces fool you, they're direct sisters. But they're always going their separate ways, never going on trips together, and their friends are separate too, each making their own friends. And on the contract Joan signed for her first film, there was a clause that she could never say that Olivia was her sister. Although they may have different opinions due to their different personalities, it's a bit too much to not acknowledge their sisterhood.</p>
<p>After Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone's divorce became a reality, Hollywood was in an uproar, and everyone was talking about Joan and Richard Cromwell's romance. Richard is also considered a dashing young man in Hollywood. He and Joan have known each other for almost ten years. He also visited Joan and Van Heflin's home. Later, he also became friends with Franchot Tone. He certainly has a great admiration for Joan. Recently, he even sculpted a bust of Joan and keeps it at home. Joan, on the other hand, acknowledges that Richard is a handsome, capable, and rare man. Therefore, according to general observation, it would not be unexpected if there was a feeling beyond friendship between them.</p>
<p>One night, Robert Young's neighbors saw someone trying to open the door to Robert Young's house. They knew that Robert Young was not at home that night, and his servant was on vacation. Without a doubt, the person at the door late at night was a "thief." Robert Young is usually very friendly, so how could they not help when they saw that his house was about to be robbed? So, they immediately reported it to the police. Suddenly, police sirens blared, and many police officers arrived, shining their flashlights everywhere. Sure enough, the "thief" was climbing on the kitchen window, trying to jump inside. The police rushed up and caught him. But he opened his mouth and said, "If someone forgets to bring their key when they go out, can't they think of a way to get into their own house?" Needless to say, Robert Young was performing his usual absurd style. But since so many people had been busy for half the night because of him, he felt a little embarrassed, so he invited them all into the house and treated them to some tea and water to express his gratitude.</p>

<h3>Li Wah Cup Finals Next Weekend;  Civil Servants Team Decides on Lineup, Hope Chinese Team Sends Best Players to Compete</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) We still remember the Li Wah Cup Preliminary Football Game held on February 18th at the Hong Kong Stadium. At that time, the selection of players for the Chinese team was quite difficult because South China had recruited Gong Wo. Fortunately, Li Huitang spared no effort to contribute his services and led a group of young players to compete with the Navy team. Because all the soldiers fought bravely on the battlefield, they finally eliminated the Navy with a large score of four to one and won the right to the final.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Civil Servants team defeated the Army team and also won the final spot. The final date was originally scheduled for April 2nd. As it happened, the Singapore Chinese team came to Hong Kong to compete, so this championship battle was brought forward to March 26th (Sunday).</p>
<p>Now that the war period is near, the General Association responsible for selecting the Civil Servants team has already selected the players yesterday. Although the entire front line is not very complete, the strength is still not weak. The front line has Gao Shanhong, and the central defense has Purvis. Both are people who have experienced many battles. It is hoped that the Chinese team will select the best players to play, and it may be a good idea to invite Li Huitang to participate again. Since he made a great contribution in the previous match, he can be re-elected as the team leader for this final. At that time, if he fights and wins the championship, he will naturally be happy to personally accept the glory of the award. However, it is not known whether he is willing to contribute his services again. (Dong Lang)</p>

<h3>Important Football Match Today;  South China and Eastern Fight Strong Teams;  Victory or Defeat Matters Greatly for Championship</h3>
<p>(Special Report from this newspaper) The championship account for the First Division Football League only owes the final calculation of "one in two in each encounter". Whether it belongs to South China or falls into the hands of the Navy will be guaranteed to be revealed by the end of this month. But for fans who want to know what happens next, please do not neglect today's several important games.</p>
<p>Today, the attention of general fans will of course focus on the two matches between South China vs Police and Eastern vs Navy. However, they should respond in different ways. What is their intention? However, do as you please.</p>
<p>In the four games of the group, in terms of strength, South China should beat the Police. The Eastern and Navy game will be a fierce battle, and the outcome cannot be predicted. Mito will definitely lose to St. Joseph's, and South China will have a fierce contest with Kowloon Club.</p>
<p>One point worth noting is that all three Chinese teams are guest teams tonight and play their matches on the opponents' home ground. This home advantage may lead to unexpected results. It is hoped that the three Chinese teams will work hard to overcome their difficult situations and bear the profit themselves.</p>
<p>Driven by the hope of winning the championship, South China will send its original lineup to play. Liu Qingcai, who had a foot injury, can play, so the overall strength is strong. On the Police side, there will be changes in the lineup, with Jia Da playing on the inside street and Gordon playing in the middle field with a very unfamiliar name. In the future, the Police will ultimately not be South China's opponent. The two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Li Guowei Lei Rongzhao Liu Qingcai</p>
<p>Luo Yao Wen Guo Yuanqi Feng Zhongxiang Li Zhaorong Zheng Guangsen</p>
<p>Police Association</p>
<p>McHardy</p>
<p>Parker Bullock Brown</p>
<p>Burton Gordon Naifu</p>
<p>Morse Flower Leah Fan Guicai Watts Huang Wengui</p>
<p>Eastern's hope of winning the runner-up has become increasingly faint. They must win against the Navy today and win all the subsequent matches in order to compete for an equal position with the Navy. If there is another loss, they will not be able to climb to second place. It is said that Hou Chengtou and Song Lingsheng of Eastern will rest due to foot injuries and will not participate in the war. If this is the case, it is not very optimistic. The Navy's personnel are no better than before. If all the members of Eastern are of one mind and one heart, they may be able to win two points. The Eastern formation is as follows:</p>
<p>Eastern Association</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Miao Huaguo Xu Buyun</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan Zeng Zhongyun Liu Shizan</p>
<p>Yu Qiaxing Xu Jingcheng Li Deqi Wu Qixiang Chen Bingtou</p>
<p>The South China vs Kowloon Club game will be held at the Kowloon Club, and the home advantage is more important than anything else. Kowloon Club has never failed when playing at home. Therefore, it is difficult for South China to win today. Perhaps the members will perform as they did when they defeated the Navy, and then there is still hope. Work hard and break the Kowloon Club's unbeaten record at home. The two formations are as follows: (Taisui)</p>

The personnel of the two teams have been decided one after another. The Chinese team has a stronger force and should win to get to the final.</p>
<p>According to the General Association Reporter, it was discovered at last week's Silver Shield semi-final that someone was selling fake tickets outside the stadium. In order to prevent this abuse, spectators tomorrow must purchase tickets from the ticket office before being allowed to enter the stadium, and children are not allowed to enter without a ticket. Ticket sales are also limited. If the limited number of tickets is sold out, all doors will be closed. Spectators who want to avoid missing out due to being full, please arrive early. The two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball Game;  First Division Eastern Meets South China</h3>
<p>There are two public men's basketball games tonight at the basketball hall. The first game (6:30 PM) is the Second Division International vs Taikoo. The second game (7:30 PM) is the First Division Eastern vs South China. The last game (8:30 PM) is the Second Division Hua Xiong vs South China. The game between Taikoo and International is evenly matched, and the outcome cannot be predicted. The game between Yinfang and South China is a First Division game and is sure to attract attention. Moreover, the fighting power of both sides is extremely strong. Eastern's lineup includes Xu Heng, Huang Dingfen, Feng Nianhua, and Chen Qizong, all of whom have good skills and are excellent materials for the front line. Sun Baoqing, Luo Jian, Wu Huaxiong, etc. are stationed on the border and defend with skill. On the South China side, the Shi brothers are known for being agile, and Xiao Jiemin, Lu Enjing, Chen Bangzhen, etc. also have the ability to overcome obstacles and defeat generals. Meeting in the arena tonight is sure to be a fierce battle. Hua Xiong vs South China B. Hua Xiong's team has Yao Junjie, Lu Bin, Li Rumin, Huang Zhaopan, etc., who are not weak in combat power. South China has Wu Haifu, Deng Lianhong, etc., but the talents of the entire army are not evenly distributed, and I am afraid they are not Hua Xiong's enemy. The players of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>First Division</p>
<p>(Eastern Society) Feng Nianhua, Xu Heng, Huang Dingfen, Sun Baoqing, Luo Jian, Wu Huaxiong, Tie Guoneng, Wu Guoxiang, Chen Qishi, Lao Tao,</p>
<p>(South China) Xiao Jiemin, Lu En, Qian Jinghui, Shi Zhen, Shi Zhenda, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xinqu, Chen Bangzhen,</p>
<p>(Second Division)</p>
<p>(International Team) Li Guoqi, Li Bonian, Li Yue, Huang Guoyi, Zhang Guangze, Hu Guangwen, Guo En, Chen Zihua, Yuan Fang, Chen Yongfa,</p>
<p>(Hua Xiong Team) Yao Junjie, Hong Xiaotai, Huang Zhaopan, Li Yumin, Lu Bin,</p>
<p>(South China B) Wu Haifu, Deng Lianhong, Huang Haitang, Liu Bingshuo, Chen Jinghui, Wei Enrong, Lin Gou Xian, Chen Chuli, Deng Yaoming, Lin Zhishu,</p>
<h3>University Hall Athletic Meet Held Today</h3>

<h3>Da Linzhen's Majestic Demeanor Undiminished: Easily Defeats Yi Yunshi Yesterday with Scores of 6-1 in Two Straight Sets</h3>
<p>The open lawn tennis tournament held only one singles match yesterday, between Yi Yunshi and Da Linzhen. The match was quite exciting, with Linzhen repeatedly using left and right-hand smashes to attack his opponent. Yi Yunshi was frequently under threat. In the first set, Linzhen won 6-1. In the second set, Linzhen continued his momentum, winning again with the same score.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results:</p>
<p>Da Linzhen defeats Yi Yunshi, 6-1, 6-1.</p>

<h3>Volleyball Match: South China versus Bai Lu</h3>
<p>The Dasheng Cup volleyball tournament will be held today at 3:00 PM, with South China playing Bai Lu at the Bu Qiu court. South China boasts players such as Zeng Quan, He Peigen, Hu Yaodong, and Li Zhenzhong, making their team quite formidable. Bai Lu also has players such as Chen Moji, Ma Quandong, Deng Xichou, and Yu Tingqi, but their team coordination is not consistent, so they are likely no match for South China. The lineups for both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>First Row Second Row Third Row</p>
<p>Yu Junrui Xu Zijun Chen Jirao</p>
<p>Li Baotian Yu Qien Wu Xiangbai</p>

<h3>Li Huitang and Tan Jungan Can Both Go to the Philippines for Competition; Parker Will Return to England and Cannot Accompany</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Hong Kong football team going to the Philippines for recruitment soon has already finalized a list of fifteen players, with Li Huitang as captain. According to Huitang, the issue of his and Tan Jungan's leave still depended on the return of the manager of the Rui Team Foreign Firm (where both Li and Tan work) to Hong Kong for confirmation. Yesterday, Li and Tan informed the General Association that they could both make the trip. Also, Parker will be returning to England during the day and cannot join the team in the Philippines, and has informed the General Association, requesting that they select someone else to fill his position.</p>
<h3>Also Talking About Children's Sports (II)</h3>
<p>— Chu Fa Lu</p>
<p>Again, there's the singing game, usually used for kindergarten teaching materials. Its composition is rigid and adheres to old methods. There is a lot of singing and little movement, and the movements are mostly dull and lacking in interest, insufficient to meet the needs of children's physical and mental development. Facts tell us that only larger kindergartens can use this type of material. Smaller schools either incorporate these soft materials with older children or lack materials suitable for younger children.</p>
<p>The main reason for this disparity is that everyone sees physical education as too easy and is unwilling to study it diligently. Secondly, elementary school physical education teachers lack formal professional training and do not know what teaching methods and appropriate materials are. Asking them to do something beyond their capabilities is like a fool's dream.</p>
<p>The scope of physical education not only includes exercises that directly affect children's physiques but also indirectly affects hygiene matters. Exercise and hygiene are truly interdependent and closely related. Those who advocate military physical training should not only pay attention to exercise and neglect hygiene. If one trains on one hand and becomes ill on the other, then the benefits gained from exercise will certainly not compensate for the harm caused by poor hygiene. This is an obvious fact that needs no further explanation. Our country's physical training for children focuses on direct exercise, while indirect hygiene is not even discussed.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, children's lives, besides movement and sleep, also include eating, one of the three parts, especially during infancy, when their appetite is even stronger. We can see that whenever they get something, regardless of whether it tastes good or not, whether they can eat it or not, they put it in their mouths. However, because their intelligence is underdeveloped, they lack judgment and therefore do not know restraint. As long as they can eat, they eat everything, not caring about the capacity of their stomachs or their digestive abilities. Children eat unlimitedly like this because they are ignorant. Parents are knowledgeable and should guide them to restrain themselves, but they often ignore everything. As soon as they hear a child wants to eat, they immediately give them food, even when the child is crying not for food. They need to know that a child's stomach is not bottomless, and their digestion is not unlimited. Giving them food without limit will only fill their stomach, forcing them to digest faster, and what cannot be digested will be expelled through the anus. The result will inevitably lead to the digestive organs being overworked and exhausted, eventually leading to eating only what is excreted, unable to be transformed into nutrients to nourish the body. This is the same as not eating, and at the same time, it will cause malnutrition and postnatal deficiencies. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Say What You Think</h3>
<p>— Wei Fei</p>
<p>Nothing to do at night, sitting idly on a chair thinking: "When a person reaches the point of shamelessness, they really have lost their humanity." Suddenly, there came a burst of barking, very strange, as if very sad. My thoughts were also shifted to remember that there are some very peculiar, rare, and quite clever "dogs" in the world.</p>
<p>Some gluttonous dogs, as long as someone has given them something to eat or raised them, will wag their tails a few times in front of the person, jump a few times, sniff around the person's feet, or make various gestures to please the person, maybe even do something for the person, guard the door; if they meet a stranger, they will bark or bite, if they are given more food and raised well, they will become the master's attendants, follow the master on the street, sometimes when the master needs them to do something, they will tell them to do it, because they have no humanity, they are dogs, people will not blame them, say they are despicable, cheap, maybe even give a slight smile from the nostrils; and themselves? They also do not feel despicable, cheap, nor do they care about (or are not afraid of) people's laughter, and feel that they are very loyal and diligent in serving the master, very great, loyal, and capable, often walking with a sway, however, they are also quite clever, although they know that they are so capable, but they never leave the master's heels a step, because they feel that when they leave, it is like a baby losing its protective mother, although they cherish their lives so much, they sometimes, because companions do not share food clearly, they will disregard their lives, barking or biting each other, this is their characteristic.</p>
<p>There are also some dogs that are not very gluttonous, but in order to be loyal to the master, when the master is speaking or about to speak, they will chime in or bark a few times in advance, but unfortunately, people get impatient and drive them away together. Even children feel that "dead dogs" are coming. Originally, they could always walk to the master's side, but the master also happened to be frustrated, he felt very bored, maybe the master no longer had the strength to care about them, so they quietly slipped away to another place, although in the middle there was still a faint and sad barking, but no one cared about them anymore, because the master's frustration was a small matter, their own expulsion was a big matter, becoming even more boring. For their own sake, for the master's sake, from any point of view, it is necessary to find a way to save this critical situation, first, to praise themselves, not to be driven away so badly again, second, to confuse a group of wavering people at the crossroads, and further pull back a group of like-minded and loyal servants of the master and buy a group who only hope to get more to eat, although there is also this need or plan, it is too inappropriate for them to do it themselves, so a group of small dogs with missions went to various places to mingle or bark, verbal barking is of course ineffective, to be more effective, widely publicized, they cannot escape from blowing in newspapers and publications, however, it is impossible to blow in the place where they were driven away, and it is not very useful to blow in the master's place, only in the place between the two, there are many of his × people, and those × people have no power to drive him away, scolding or laughing, he "does not care about (or is not afraid of)", then, he loudly promotes it in a certain daily newspaper, a certain weekly newspaper, and two obscene tabloids.</p>
<p>Perhaps dogs are always dogs, and the sound of the drums is indeed difficult to hear, maybe that is why there are not many readers, and they gradually feel bored, but not barking is not an option, when bored, they can only bark randomly, or deliberately reverse people's right and wrong, accuse people falsely... in short, they themselves have become a drowning dog, and also want to pull people into the water together.</p>
<p>Generally, the more they bark randomly, the fewer listeners and more beaters there are, and in the end, there will be a day when everyone shouts to beat them.</p>
<h3>On the Lake</h3>
<p>— Peng Chenghui</p>
<p>It is a vast expanse of white, a silver lake of ten thousand acres, the shore is covered with dense reeds, and flocks of gulls occasionally fly up from them. On the mountain side across the lake, there are many sparsely scattered houses, and the smoke from cooking is rising from the chimneys of every household, a wisp at a time, deeply into the clouds.</p>
<p>The rising sunlight shines brightly, like the ancient "Liangshanbo." The gentle morning breeze blows lightly. On the surface of the lake, there are constantly thousands of ripples, the colors of the lake and mountains, in this bright morning light, are fully performing their magnificent, natural beauty.</p>
<p>At this time, Mei and I are standing on a corner of the lake, admiring this beautiful water and mountain scenery. We gaze at the changes in the morning glow in the sky and look down at the ripples of the waves. We are stunned, as if we have stepped into a poetic dreamland.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the reeds about a hundred yards away from us, a small boat glides out. On it, there is only a girl rowing with a single oar. The sound of the oar rises and falls rhythmically, and the boat sails towards the center of the lake like an arrow following the sound of the oar. Mixed with it is a sweet singing, breaking the silence of the air:</p>
<p>The sun rises, the morning breeze is cool,</p>
<p>Ah Nong rows her oar,</p>
<p>To meet my love,</p>
<p>The government's military orders are issued,</p>
<p>Sending my love to the battlefield—</p>
<p>My love has the ambition to serve the country.</p>
<p>Hearing the news, I am as happy as mad.</p>
<p>From now on, he will have the chance to kill the Japanese pirates,</p>
<p>Not failing the good times for brave men.</p>
<p>My love should know,</p>
<p>The Japanese pirates are very cruel,</p>
<p>Our land is invaded year after year,</p>
<p>Cities are burned day by day,</p>
<p>How many millions of homes have been destroyed?</p>
<p>How many millions of lives have been killed?</p>
<p>If this revenge is not avenged today, when will it be avenged?</p>
<p>If this hatred is not eliminated today, when will it be eliminated?</p>
<p>My love! Grip your gun tightly, run forward</p>
<p>Drink the blood of the Japanese devils,</p>
<p>Eat the flesh of the Japanese devils!</p>
<p>My love, remember,</p>
<p>Do not hesitate on the battlefield,</p>
<p>Under the overturned nest, there are no intact eggs,</p>
<p>Men serve the country at this time,</p>
<p>If the country is broken and the family is destroyed, there will be no peace,</p>
<p>Only to be slaves for generations to come,</p>
<p>My love, advance bravely!</p>
<p>Do not sadly bid farewell to Ah Nong!</p>
<p>The sun rises, the morning breeze is cool,</p>
<p>Ah Nong rows her oar,</p>
<p>To see off my lover,</p>
<p>I wish my love to advance bravely,</p>
<p>Grip your gun and go to the battlefield,</p>
<p>Kill all the traitors and then stop,</p>
<p>Recover our land and promote our country,</p>
<p>My love, advance bravely,</p>
<p>Do not chatter about your hometown to Ah Nong.</p>
<p>The boat gradually moved away, and the singing gradually became weaker. Finally, the shadow of the boat and the singing disappeared into the scenery of the lake and mountains.</p>
<p>"You should learn from her," I said to her with a smile.</p>
<p>"You also have to have his courage!" She replied coquettishly.</p>
<p>We smiled at each other. On our way back, we both had the belief of final victory in our hearts.</p>
<h3>Morning Song</h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>Dawn swallowed the night,</p>
<p>Sunlight melted the gloom:</p>
<p>The church bells broadcast a loud sound,</p>
<p>Awakening the sleeping hearts in the city.</p>
<p>Fog shrouds the peaks,</p>
<p>The crucifix stretched out in mid-air,</p>
<p>Kneels devoutly to the Holy Lord</p>
<p>To offer peaceful morning prayers.</p>
<p>Little birds dance on the branches,</p>
<p>Singing the hymns of dawn.</p>
<p>But the lingering haze,</p>
<p>Why does it hinder the universal light?</p>
<p>Go away, haze!</p>
<p>I want light!</p>
<h3>"Warming a Cold Stove" and "Beating a Drowning Dog"</h3>
<p>— Mo Xie</p>
<p>Both are frustrated people, some are regarded as "cold stoves" and constantly "warmed," while others are regarded as "drowning dogs" and beaten by the crowd. It can be said that some are lucky and some are unfortunate.</p>
<p>"Stove" is "dog," and "dog" is "stove," two in one, one in two. I do not know whether those who "warm" or "beat" have the Dharma eye to distinguish them. However, there is one thing I do know, that is, those who "warm" can also "beat," and those who "beat" can also "warm." The two can be combined, just like those who are good at "blowing" are also good at "flattering," and those who are good at "flattering" are good at "blowing," coming together so perfectly.</p>
<p>Generally, people think that warming a cold stove is accumulating virtue and doing good deeds. Although it is not certain that it will be like Han Xin's cold stove, which has a thousand gold reward, helping the frustrated and pitiful is a good thing. Only beating a drowning dog is truly adding insult to injury and is not worth learning from. Anyone who has a little bit of benevolence and a slight concern for charity should not take this action. Therefore, although the social view equates "stove" and "dog," it transforms those who "warm" and those who "beat" into two different kinds of people, treating them differently. Those who are good at "warming" have the good name of philanthropists, while those who are good at "beating" often have the evil epithet of mean ghosts.</p>
<p>However, upon careful reflection, there are "stoves" that should not be "warmed," and there are "dogs" that must be "beaten." I am afraid that saying this is too abstract and difficult to understand. It may be helpful to give an example to clarify it.</p>
<p>"Mr. Dangji" becomes a "three-no-ism" person, living in seclusion at home, and becomes such a "stove" or "dog" himself. — The so-called "again" is because he has been honored as such a "stove" or "dog" several times — if someone goes to "warm" him, wouldn't it increase his evil power? Suppose you go to "warm" him, and he becomes "prosperous" because of it. The "salary" price he will repay you in the future is considerable, but once the situation becomes a prairie fire, exploding, what about the people of the world! I think such a "cold stove" should not be warmed. It should be allowed to be covered with clear water to extinguish it, so that it is cold and collapsed, which is the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Based on the premise that "spoiling" is "dog," he is now also a "dog" in the "river." According to legend, he does not seem to be reconciled to his fate and regards water as his home, but intends to climb ashore. And his "claws" are indeed active, wanting to promote his "shore up" movement. If he comes ashore, who can guarantee that he will not become a "mad dog" and harm people? Then, now that he is still "in the river" and has not landed, when should we beat him if not now!</p>
<p>Therefore, warming a cold stove like "a cold volcano" does not count as doing good deeds, but is doing bad deeds; similarly, beating a drowning dog like "a mad dog" does not count as doing bad deeds, but is doing good deeds. Today's "warmers" and "beaters" should think twice.</p>
<p>There is also a reason for the so-called combining "warming" and "beating." Generally, the purpose of both is not necessarily altruistic, but to benefit oneself. He wants the warmed person to become successful one day, so he can get assistance, and the beaten person, of course, is someone who hinders him. Once beaten so that he cannot rise again, he can sleep soundly from now on. So, such a person will both "warm" and "beat."</p>
<p>Similarly, "warming" and "beating" out of a sense of justice, so that good people prosper and bad people drown, also have the wonder of complementing each other, and can be integrated into one person.</p>
<p>"Perhaps someone wants to ask me personally about my attitude towards this matter, then I can say that I very much admire Liang Boluan, who "does not warm because of people's popularity." "Warm stoves" should not be warmed, let alone "cold stoves"! I also very much admire Zhou Xiaohou, who eliminated the three harms. A great man shoots tigers in the southern mountains and kills long-tailed dragons. What is a "drowning dog"!</p>
<h3>Black Hero</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dun Sheng</p>
<p>Milton Herndon, 29, a black captain of a machine gun company of the "Lincoln Battalion," and the brother of the famous American revolutionary activist Angelo Herndon, died in battle on the Saragossa front in Spain during a decisive battle against fascist forces.</p>
<p>Milton was a member of the Young Communist League (his brother was a leader of the YCL). Two and a half years ago, he went to Spain to join the International Brigades, composed of anti-fascists from various countries. Soon after, he was appointed commander of the "Douglass" machine gun company and participated in many battles.</p>
<p>He is survived by his mother, two sisters, and five brothers.</p>
<p>His brother, Angelo, said, "My brother's death proves that black people are now beginning to understand that only by uniting with all progressive humanity can they win freedom for themselves and ensure their protection from lynching. He, along with other black people who went to Spain, helped write a glorious chapter in the history of the struggle for progress."</p>
<p>According to soldiers of the "Lincoln Battalion" who returned to the United States, 40 percent of the American black people who joined the International Brigades were promoted to officers.</p>
<p>Milton Herndon was the third American black person from the "Lincoln Battalion" to die in battle. Before him, Aronsa, Witteson, and Olfero Luo of the "Muni" machine gun company were killed in action.</p>
<p>The young Milton Herndon worked in hardware factories in Toledo and Chicago and joined the labor transport in 1935. He was arrested once when he served as a picket during a major strike at the "Georgia" factory. Later, he joined the Young Communist League.</p>

<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>She continued excitedly, "Sir, I'm telling you, I have an advantage—that is, I listen. If you want me to beat the dog, I won't scold the chicken. If you want me to kill the chicken, I will definitely kill it cleanly. When you eat it, you definitely won't find a single feather. Don't you believe me?"</p>
<p>"I believe you, I believe you. In the future, if I want to kill a chicken, I will definitely ask you. But, now I want you to invite the young lady."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll go find the young lady. Have I talked too much, sir? Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"Not much yet."</p>
<p>"Sir, then we'll talk again next time."</p>
<p>He almost trembled. He thought:</p>
<p>"You killed me! I didn't commit a crime!"</p>
<p>After the servant left, the one he was waiting for arrived. He hid by the door, secretly grasping the doorknob with one hand, smilingly watching the person who came—a young girl. Her beautiful face was more beautiful than her photo; she didn't need rouge, her cheeks were the color of rouge; on the fair skin between her eyebrows was a small mole like a black pearl, darker than the ink that vain coquettes used to draw; her eyes, set off by a drop of holy water, were sharp and agile. Agile enough to stir a man's settled desires. In short, her face possessed all the symbolic—typical—beauty of the universe. She wore a light blue silk shirt embroidered with small rose and snow-white flowers; the former could symbolize her beauty, the latter could represent the color of her heart; although her father was a traitor to his country. She wasn't flustered when she saw the stranger; while putting down the sheet music in her hand, she said:</p>
<p>"Who is it? Coming into the house and not taking off your coat, really, still wearing a fur hat!" She walked closer to the stranger and asked, "Take off your fur hat and let me see who it is."</p>
<p>Seeing that the other person stood blankly by the door, without a trace of a response, she felt even more estranged. Following that, her question changed to a stranger's tone:</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"Looking for you!"</p>
<p>"I don't know you!"</p>
<p>"But, I know you, you are Zhu Lin!"</p>
<p>At this time, she was somewhat suspicious. Could there be people who knew each other without ever having met? Therefore, she hurriedly walked closer to him, wanting to re-examine his face; while searching her memories, she looked at him thoughtfully and said:</p>
<p>"Who exactly are you?" (10)</p>
