<h3 id="c1">閻錫山將軍：鞏固民衆組織奠定勝利基礎 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（一）新形勢下的新任務</p>
<p>目前抗戰已轉入一個新的局面。這一新的抗戰局面的主要特徵是：第一×人的進攻力量還未失去，×人的進攻企圖也還未停止，但由於我方戰略戰術的改進和×人兵力物力的巨大消耗及其兵力的愈益分散，使得×人的進攻力量日漸增加新的困難，而　逐漸從戰略進攻轉變爲戰略保守的可能，這一可能是否能够迅連實現，當然要視我方努力的程度而定。第二，我國雖失去了更多的土地，增加了更多的一些困難，但在民族革命的戰爭中除去不少障碍民族生機的遺毒，培養了新生的革命力量，造不了抗戰勝利的一些條件，奠定了新興國家的初步基礎；不過還　不够，雖有條件，尙不完滿，雖有基礎，尙不堅實，新生的革命力量雖已生長，但尙不能精鍊。第三，×人進攻旣困難漸多，必然的將要轉而肅淸其後方的抗戰勢力，以鞏固其佔領區域，這樣，在×人後方戰鬥的抗×勢力，就要遭受更多的困難。道就是我們抗戰的新形勢。</p>
<p>閻錫山將軍：鞏固民衆組織奠定勝利基礎</p>
<p>這抗戰新形勢的發展前途是怎搽呢？我以爲最可能的前途是：第一，×人雖企圖繼續深人，但在戰爭過程中，×愈由强轉弱，我愈由弱轉强，使×不得不停止其進攻而轉入保守狀態，第二我國新的革命力量愈趨精鍊，抗戰勝　的條件愈趨完滿，新興國家的基礎愈趨堅實，總之，民族革命成功的時期愈益接近。第三，×對其後方抗日力量，必將盡力打擊。但在×後方作戰的抗日力量，反而更團結更鞏固，更發展更壯大，造下將來的收復失地的有力條件。不過，這個光明前途要靠我全國車民努力爭取，才能達到，否則，也可能走到最艱險最惡劣的道途，而遲延民族革命勝利的進程。</p>
<p>怎樣才取能爭到上面所說的那個光明前途呢，就全國來說，應該一方面展開全面抗戰，停止×人的繼續進攻走上轉守爲攻，轉敗爲勝的路子，一方面加緊國內團結，繼續革新政治，加速進行經濟建設，動員全民參加抗戰建國的事業，創立大批的現代化有基礎的新軍，最後進行反攻，收復失地。就二戰區來說，我們應在全國建立健全鞏固的游學根據地，作爲華北的一個要塞，全國的一個堡壘，爲國家民族盡一部份責任。要想做到這一點，我認爲必須建立現代化的有基礎的三十萬團力的鐵軍和鞏固百萬民衆組織。這就是我們在新形勢下的新任務。</p>
<p>（二）建立健全鞏固的游擊　根據地與鞏固民衆組織</p>
<p>上面己經說到，建立現代化的有基礎的團力的鐵軍和鞏固民衆組織，是建立健全鞏固的游擊根據地的二大基礎。關於建立鐵軍的問題，我不想在這裏多說，將來另文討論，在這裏我要把建立游擊根據地和鞏固民衆組織的問題略談一談。</p>
<p>我認爲建立游　根據地，離開了民衆是不行的，建立游擊根據地需要建立現代化的基礎的團力的鐵軍，但沒有民衆來參加和補充，沒有民衆來帮助軍隊作戰，鐵軍就不能發揮其威力，建立游擊根據地需要一個鞏固的進步的政權，但沒有民衆來維護政權，推動政權，我們的政權就要場台，塌就要著後，建立游擊根據地需要進行經濟建設，但沒有民衆來參加和支持，經濟建設就要失敗，就要落空，建立游擊根據地需要淸除內奸，防止外奸，但沒有民衆來巡邏放硝，報告檢舉，除奸工作就下能有效進行，卽使勉强進行，也是事倍功半，由此可知，民衆　在是建立游擊根據地的一個重要絛件。</p>
<p>但我要進一步的指山，要想使民衆參加和帮助軍隊，維護和推動政權，參加和支持經濟建設，進行除奸工作等等，不把民衆組織起來是不行的，所以我們說，建立游擊根據地不但需要民衆，而且　要有組織的民衆。</p>
<p>遠在綏遠抗戰之時，我就提出了組織百萬民衆的口號，主張在統一意志下，廣大的組織民衆，以集中人力，担負民族革命之使命。二年以來，山西的民衆組織雖然有了一些成績，但基礎還太薄弱，太不鞏固。</p>
<p>今天的抗戰形勢迫切的需要我們建立一個健全鞏固的游擊根據地，而建立健全鞏固的游擊根據地的這一重大任務，又迫切的需要我們有鞏固的廣大民衆組織，不容諱言的，今天山西民衆組織的鞏固，尙不足以適應建立健全鞏固的游擊根據地的需要，所以我今天提出鞏固百萬民衆組織的口號來。</p>
<p>總之，建立健全衆固的游擊根據地和鞏固民衆組織是不可分離的，鞏固民衆組織是建立健全鞏固游擊根據地的一佃基本條件，不能鞏固民衆組織，建立健全鞏固的游擊根據地就是空談。</p>
<p>三　山西二年來民衆組織的檢討</p>
<p>我認爲山西數年來民衆組織的發展可以分爲三個階叚來說，從公犧成立到太原失守是一個階段，在這一個階段裏，山西的民衆組織普遍的建立起來，從村政協助員與特派員相繼下鄉工作，以前不識不知的人民大衆開始覺悟起來了。山西民衆由不問國事的狀態走上踴躍參加公犧的狀態，這是山西數年來民衆組織的第一個發展，從太原失守到臨汾失守又是一個階級，在這一階段裏，各地普遍的產生了許多新的民衆救亡團體，如農救，工救，靑救，兒救，婦救等，這些民衆救亡團體對於山西的抗戰起了很大的推動，與支持的作用，自衛隊的組織也更加壯大和充實起來了，在公犧這一個政治性的羣衆救亡團體的基礎之上，依照民衆之不同的利益與特性，組織了更多的各種各樣的民衆救亡團體，這是山西數年來民衆組織的第二個發展，從臨汾失守到現在，又是一個階段，在這一階段裏，各種各樣的民衆救亡團體都正式參加公犧，成爲公犧的團體會員，同時　各種各樣的民衆救亡團體的本身，也都或先或後的建立起她們自己的高級領導機關來，山西的民衆組織，無論在政治上或組織上，都以比較凌亂散曼的狀態逐漸走上比較整齊統一的狀態，這是山西數年來民衆組織的第三個發展。第三個階段尙未完結，現仍在繼續發展中。</p>
<p>由以上所說看來，近年山西民衆組織的發展和進步是相當迅速的，二年以來。山西的民衆組織就量上說，己達到了百萬民衆甚至超過百萬的數目，就　上說，山西民衆已從不識不知進到覺悟，從覺悟進到部份的能行動起來了。</p>
<p>裏我要簡單的說明山西二年來民衆組織之所以能够這橡發展和進步，主要的是由于它具備了以下的幾個優點：第一，山西二年以來的各種民衆救亡團體都是在和×人戰鬥中生長和壯大起來的，因此它富於戰鬥性，第二，它們都是民主集權的組織。第三，它們組織工作大都能和民衆的實際生活相聯繋。第四，它們和政府的關係一般的都很好。</p>
<p>但是我要鄭重指出：山西二年來的民衆組織的發展和進步雖然很快然而它的弱點也很大而又很多的。</p>
<p>山西二年來民衆組織的第一個大弱點是政治動員和組織工作的不深入，不實際，政治動員不深人，不實際，使得組織工作只有架子，缺乏力量，組織工作的不深入，不實際，又使得政治動員只有口號，缺乏內容。這兩個弱點交相爲用，結果就產生了一個極大的弱點，那就是，政治上的乏力，組織上的脆弱，這是山西民衆組織的一個絕大危機。</p>
<p>山西二年來民衆組織的第二個大弱點是組織領導的散亂與薄弱。各種各樣的民衆救亡團體，在一個相　長久的期間裏都沒有建立起他們各自的最高的領導機關，（雖然最近總工會已經恢復工作，省農救正在籌備之中但都還未走上統一領導的路子，尙待繼續努力），這樣，就必然的妨礙了民衆組織的領導的統一與加强，同時也妨碍了民衆組織的更大發展。</p>
<p>山西二年來民衆組織的第二個大弱點是對幹部尤其是地方幹部選拔培養和訓練的不够。二年以來。雖然產生了不少的新民運的幹部，但還遠趕不上實際的需要尤其是地方幹部實在太少。這樣，對於許多尙未組織起來的民衆，固然不易把他們迅速組織起來，卽對於已經組織起來的民衆，也拿不起來把　不住，運用不了。這三個大弱點結合起來，就形成了目前山西民衆組織的一個大毛病，那就是，名多實少，外强中乾　換句話說，也就是不鞏固，今後如果不能克服這個大毛病，山西的民衆組織不但不能迅速發展，進步，反而會逐漸削弱，退少。</p>
<p>四　鞏固百萬民衆組織的基本方針</p>
<p>在前面我已經講過，爲了要建立一個健全鞏固的游擊根據地，我們必須把民衆組織迅速的鞏固起來，檢討了山西二年來的民衆組織，我們發現了山西民衆組織的最大手病正就是不鞏同，這樣，鞏固百萬民衆組織的任務，就不能不成爲非常重要而迫切的了。</p>
<p>我認爲要想鞏固百萬民衆組織，首先必須確定以下的幾個總方針：</p>
<p>第一，鞏固百萬民衆組織，應以建立健全鞏固的游擊根據地為鵠的，一切工作，均應朝向這個方向做去，</p>
<h3 id="c2">廣西猺山敎育現狀 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 白雪</p>
<p>（桂林通訊）最近有個機會走進桂平象縣兩縣的猺區，參觀了設立在『特種敎育區域』的國民基礎學校十來所，僅僅這麼狹窄的地方，僅僅這麼少數的學校，要想把她來代表廣西對少數民埃敎育的實施情形，自屬不行，但就這些學校所發見的問題之多，已經够人深思，並且很有提供研究的價値。</p>
<p>廣西政府的全盤計劃，凡一個縣份轄有苗峒猺山的，就得把這些少數民族住區，統統劃爲『特種敎育區域』，並由縣政府斟酌當地地形，交通，戶口，學童各方面，劃定設校區域，繪圖並加說明，呈報省政府敎育廳核定後，始得設校，在開始設校後的第一二兩年中，如縣欵不足，並可呈請敎育廳斟酌情形，予以補助，聞自廿三年度起直至現在止，這個計劃，從未變更，而受省款補助的學校，竟達五百四十餘校之多，足見廣西當局，對於少數民族的敎育，是如何地積極推進了。</p>
<p>但因爲訓練苗猺子弟，派囘原藉去辦理敎育的計劃，進行得很慢，目下在特種敎育區域的敎育工作者，大多數還是漢人。所以，問題更多而更複雜了。</p>
<p>第一，他們對於猺山生活，本非素習，一旦跑進深山大壑中，自然住不慣。因此，敎師們，一個月中，至少要出山一次，住上十天八天乃至二十天。据作者此次入山，足跡到過九校，只有兩校的敎員，因爲我們請他作響導，他們從山外引帶我們進去，才得一親顏色，其餘的六所，連敎師們的影子都沒見到』据當地猺民說：『他們出山了！』</p>
<p>第二，因爲猺山的生活，在山外人看來是十分枯燥的，在現在到處都鬧著幹部荒的時候，入山的敎師，學識較優的固不能說沒有；但濫竽充數的也不能說沒有。前年冬天，作者在猺山遇見一位校長（兼敎員）他替猺民寫一張「限童」（限期這錢的字據），約末寫了六十幾惆字，我看了好幾遍，連大意都想不出。後來詢問傘這字據給我看的猺民，他把立字大意對我說了一遍，我才知道是怎麼一囘事，可是作者此次入山調查，這位敎師，他還是在猺山敎書，這眞不能不令人長嘆了！</p>
<p>第三，在敎學方面也有改進的必要，比方在象縣的東南鄉境，雖設學校，學生甚少，少的只有五六各，還不能每天到校上課，如六巷，花山兩村，便是這樣，此外有的地方，猺民子弟雖願上學，但因敎師之不得人，有學生到校。也找不到敎師上課，如上古陳，下古陳兩村便是這樣，至於敎些什麼？除開叫學生死讀幾句課本而外，連寫的機會都少。</p>
<p>第四，學校設備應力求充實。在象縣的東南鄕，除開鄕公所所在地的六巷村，己砌有一間可以容得十來名學生的校舍外，別有村頭，還沒有校舍。而　用的民房，又窄狹得可憐。卽使有一間屋子，而裏面却又沒有檯椅，除開有一塊小方黑板外，你便再看不到什麼。聞說省款的補助費。規定是大部份用之於校中設備方面，希望立卽購備起來。在桂平的猺山裏，設立學校的地方，大多數已經有了一座校舍：而且已有了課檯坐倚黑板等項。不過，講設備，也有充實的必要。</p>
<p>第五，敎師除了敎學生念課本，對於猺民生活，大都不去理會。比方說，猺山發生的痣疾的流行症，病得許多人七歪八倒，而敎師們却束手無策。假如能以醫藥來治療猺民的病苦，不但這敎師會馬上受猺民的崇敬，而就此下手去改進猺村的衛生，不是挺好的機會嗎？</p>
<p>第六，猺山總是在縣境的邊僻之處，而且，猺民敎育，並不把它與一般的基礎敎育看得兩樣，或者以爲猺山內的敎育，能辦的像山外一樣便妥。實際上，這種觀念是錯誤的。顯然的，直到現在爲止，猺山社會之與非猺山社會，情况根本不同，我們怎能視同一律呢？要勉强求其同一設施，結果弄到不黑不白，反而阻礙特種敎育的進展．此外　有的對猺民敎育太悲觀，以爲橫豎是弄不好，何必多費心機。政府要縣辨特種敎育，縣政府也只要辦了就了事，對於特種敎育實施時所發生的一切問題，他們是無暇去顧問的。</p>
<p>綜上所述，也許有人將責作者求之過苛。這，作者十分明白，猺山敎育，只辦了短短四年的歷史，自然還有許多地地方做得不够。我寫起來，不過希望大家能够力求改進罷了。茲將個人的淺見提供於次，以備大家參考。</p>
<p>一，縣政府必須體會省政府發展少數民族敎育的苦心孤詣，在可能範圍內，應在縣經費預算中，多列一點猺山的建設費，特別早敎育費，尤須要民族平等的民族主義，儘量宣傳，以消除漢族與少數民族間數千百年來所造成的隔膜。</p>
<p>二，省政府應如緊進行並選少數民族子弟受訓，俾全盤計劃易於完成。在尙須借才漢埃時，其人選必須鄭重將事，不但要學識優良，而且要有創造精神。不但要有工作熱忱，而且要能吃苦耐勞；不但要有敎學的本領，而且要有改造苗埃社會的計劃與步驟，另一方面，在縣欵的可能範圍內，要提高這些担負特種敎育的敎師們的待遇，使之最低限的生活得以解决，才好安心服務。</p>
<p>三，派入瑤山苗洞工作的敎師們，最好用考試方法，選擇優秀份子，集中短期訓練。訓練的當中，不但要注重敎育方面，同時要注重政治方面；而且要到山內去實際調查苗猺社會情况，將山內所發現的問題，帶囘課堂來研究，尋求解决的方法。在訓練結束後，須有特種敎育研究會之組織，將來各自入山工作了，分散了，也得有個聯絡。每隔幾個月，會員又須聚集起來，開會報吿各人的工作心得，幷討論個人所不能解决的問題。這麼一來，不但可以减少山洞敎育者們的離　索處的苦悶，而且可以增加新的活力，使得每個人對工作不敢鬆懈，發生問題也有尋求解决的途徑了。（完）</p>

<p>（康定通訊）康帘兩屬民族甚爲複雜，康區人民，因崇奉佛敎，較爲純正，政府法令，尙能推行，惟寗屬野夷，獷悍異常，治理綦難，査夷人原爲蒲族，又名　玀經中國各吏家及海外學者如斯提芬孫，巴克頓，之研討。究屬何源，尙無定說。要以認爲中華固有民族之說爲是。　夷以大凉山爲中心，分佈于金沙江，大渡河沿岸雷馬屏峨及寗屬十餘縣，皆有其雄厚勢力在，一般估計，生熱白黑不下百萬餘，因民情强悍，桀驁不馴，古來主政　，率以化外之民目之，考諸史乘，自昔蜀國驅逐　人以來，歷代皆以夷人引爲國家大患，或以武力征服或以敎化歸順。或劃地相守，或賞爵覇糜，要皆施行剿撫之政策。但夷人狡詐，叛變無常，終未能使其賓服，悅然來歸，且其實力滋長蔓延。攻城掠鎭，刦殺商旅，驅逐漢人佔領土地之事，與時俱增。過去以川省財力之豐富，兵力之雄厚，尙感棘手，未能收鎭撫之效，其爲患之烈，可想而知。在昔雖設置戍兵，防其出×。冀圖暫時之安，從未積極同化，作一勞永逸之計，致國家有百萬以上樸實勇健之夷族，而不能利用，反因其幼掠之故，不但漢人難安枕席，地方資源，亦無由開發，良可喟也。西康省政府接收甯屬後，鑒於已往消極政策之錯誤，亟宜加以矯正，値茲全面抗戰期間，爲適應後防建設之需要計，特採取積極政策，决定對於夷族澈底同化，夷地完全設治，其進行步驟，先派得力勁族，征服頑强嗜殺之野夷，用立威信，然後用政治力量，次第感化，甯屬野夷。經靖邊司令鄧秀廷督率部隊進勦以來，西昌至甯南一帶之驃悍夷匪，已漸殲滅，各支殘餘夷孳，相率輸誠，並甘願坐質爲信。據最近甯方情報，西寗大道上，己完全肅淸，茲聞省府主席劉文輝，擬於最近期間，由鐵出巡寗屬，指導同化該區夷族，推動夷地設治。記者頃詣省府，訪晤劉氏，叩詢對於夷務實施方針及辨法，劉謂寗屬夷人，數在百萬以上，無宗敎，無文字，行動不啼　人，爲患邊徼巳久，自經勦撫兼施以來，西寧大道，近已完全肅淸，卽向會理方面進剿，一俟西會道通，再謀通越雋之道，今後擬將會理，鹽源鹽邊夷地漸次改流爲治，因其地區甚廣，可劃設十幾個縣，對於處理夷務，注重政洽，現卽以新組織之西康　屬屯墾委員會，爲政治上重要機構，至劉氏出巡寧屬行程，擬先別漢源場，主持保訓合一幹部訓練班，訓練事宜，項定爲期一個月，然後逕往西昌，巡視寧屬各縣，督飭夷務及屯墾事宜。</p>

<p>一、×人控制下的交通</p>
<p>（冀北通訊）從邪台（順德）到天津，事變前本來只是兩天火車路程，如今却至少要走四五天——鐵軌經常被我們的游擊隊破壞的一塌糊塗，隨時行車隨時修路，有時候，較大的鐵橋被破壞了，一直延長十天半月都說不定。</p>
<p>這眞是難挨的四五天呀！漢奸和×軍隨時可以加你一個行跡可疑的罪名，換句話說，就是隨時都有被逮捕的危險，火車出軌或被襲　，更是家常便飯，坐車的圪百姓，常常遭了車上×軍的牽連。</p>
<p>如果要出門走路，必須先取得出門的資格，一張「良民證」，一紙偽縣府的證明書和兩家舖保。</p>
<p>上了火車以後，在火車上要經過非常嚴格的檢查，無論包袱或是箱龍，全得件件打開看看，是否有違禁物品。警察——中國人——檢查時——如果沒有日軍在場的話，他們常常是敷衍了事；有機會還常常向被撿查的人訴苦：沒辦法，大家都是中國人，誰甘心願意當漢奸呢？可是他迫得你簡直是沒辦法，想跑都跑不掉。結論常常是使人興奮的！別忙，等着瞧，有機會，看老子的一下！</p>
<p>如果不幸而遇到便衣的漢奸檢查，那又算倒霉了極點，他們大多數是長袍禮帽，手中拿着刺刀，後邊常常有全幅武裝的日軍跟着，他要是看看你不順眼的話，那怕是褲襠或襪子，也全部搜案到。開箱子解包袱時，如果認爲你「太慢了」！就會毫不客氣的替你用刺刀來開。</p>
<p>中國人上火車的時候，先要排好隊伍，據說是恐怕亂了秩序，享有最先上火車的優先權的當然是日本人，上完了就輪到朝鮮人，最後才是中國人。並且得規規矩矩魚貫而行，如果日本人沒有座位，中國人得馬上把座位讓給他們，否則就有吃耳光挨把掌的危險</p>
<p>每一列客車的前後，各有兩輛鐵甲車，前邊那兩輛鐵甲車的前頭，還有三四輛兵車。上面坐着日本兵。他們的任務，據說一方面是防範土匪，一方面是誇耀「皇軍」的人多，向民衆示威。實際過來過去的始終是那幾個人。在同一的車上，比方由石莊至北平，再由北平至石莊的跑來跑去，只有，被我們的游擊隊打死了以後，才有新的補充。</p>
<p>一個車站上，都有三四門砲和砲樓，並且經常的駐着日本的　警戒兵一，大站四五百，小站二三百的數目不等，每一個鐵橋旁邊都安置着兩門砲和一個堡，讐面經常的住着幾個日本兵。</p>
<p>雖然這樣，但仍舊不能防止，我們游擊隊的經常的拔鐵軌，埋地雷，因爲一到晚間，他們就條死一般的潛伏在碉堡裏，卽使發覺有人破壞鐵軌，也輕易不敢出來，從邢台至天津，平均數十天，至少要翻車三四次。</p>
<p>中國人出門，無論如何不准携帶一百元以上的法幣，要想多携帶，只有把法幣換成聯合準備銀行偽鈔。否則就有『匪賊的嫌疑』，一見要被逮捕。有一次，石莊有個商人冒險帶了一千三百元的法幣，但是非常不幸的被一個漢奸搜着了，於是這個漢奸，就對他說：『你這個人眞太大阻了，竟敢不聽命令携帶這麼多的法幣，還是你有福遇見我了，要是被日本人　見了那還了得？」結果，這個商人僥倖逃活了命，可是一千三百元法幣，他就毫不客氣的收納了。</p>
<p>沿鐵路綫的　屋，却被日軍拆棹或焚毀了，據說爲的是防備游擊隊，但是×人這種殘酷的行爲，不但未能絲毫阻止了我游擊隊的活動：相反的，往往一夜的工夫，鐵路的兩旁豎七橫八的　滿了被鋸斷的電綫桿子，最近×人爲了防備我游擊隊的破壞，常常用　鐵綫把電　的地上一丈多高的地方，密密層層的緾起來，但是這樣也並不能發生多大効力，因爲我們的游擊隊會用梯子。</p>
<p>鐵路附近的老百姓，有時候看到非常的困難，×人在夜間，時常守　墟心不敢出來，所以夜間　乎完全成了我們游擊隊的天下，老百姓就在這時候帮助我們游擊隊工作，破路，鋸電　……黎明的時候，游擊隊走了，老百姓馬上得到×軍那里去報吿，於是×軍就命令當地的老百姓，把他們自己在夜間破壞了的路或電桿……重新修好。　（未完）</p>

<p>昨天各報刊登我國軍事當局頒佈的『優待俘虜須知』，使全世界人士明白看到强烈的對照：</p>
<p>一方面是代表反動的，退步的，也可說是逆天的勢力，就是日本侵略者，它們在侵華戰爭中，不僅橫行刦掠××屠殺，並且　用毒氣與轟炸，蹂躪不設防城市，殺戮平民婦孺，毀環衛生及文化機關。</p>
<p>另一方面，則是代表革命的，也可說是順天的勢力，就是我們抗戰的中國，我們的抵抗，不僅是『聖人不得已而用之』的抗戰，不僅在去年空襲三島時宣揚我不與日本人民為×的神聖偉大的民　精神，而且對於俘虜，亦以仁厚寬大為主。</p>
<p>古人說，「得道者昌，失道者亡」，孫子兵法的五要，亦以得道為首。我們這次抗戰，不　內得全民擁護，外得舉世同情，卽侵略者控制下的日本人民，亦將不能不同情感激，勝敗之機，原已朗如炬火！</p>

<p>當然，大家希望能如桂省政府通電所云：「名正旣正，為帥者固不敢妄自菲薄，卽為弟子者亦且循規蹈矩，必恭必敬，罔敢或越！」『猗兮盛者了！但是質諸正在為人師者不，知『能毋報顏』否！</p>

<p>到義和墟集中</p>
<p>四月的天氣是　悶的，雨像串珠般的摔下來，路是泥濘不堪，步步得關心『足下』，銀色紅點的×機，一次二次兜過我們的頭頂上向我們背後的博羅城去，向惠州城去，這樣飛行和偵察，經騐告訴我鬥，前綫是有些緊張了，但，我們正要到緊張的前綫去。</p>
<p>破碎的博羅城，已在我們背後消逝了，青山煙雨已把我們的視綫隔斷。　『先生：到義和壚　息休息好麼？』那純撲的挑着慰勞品的挑佚對我們說。『當然，我們要在義和墟會師呢。』我接着答。</p>
<p>那破陋的店戶，枯矮的樹林已呈現在我們眼前、破陋的店戶、在風狂雨暴的情景下，格外顯得可憐和渺小。</p>
<p>到義和，博羅各界慰勞前綫軍民代表團的十多位代表已集合了，大家都好似落湯鷄、但、個個心裏都感到勝利，——這也可以說是戰術的成功，把幾十個分成幾個小隊前進，避免×機偵察目標，——藉躱雨的機會作休息，不用說是合算的，可惜這個小市場　可憐，除了盲公餅、花生、煙枝可以買到，以外要找一杯茶喝擲不可能，照這個市容，本來可以舒服一下、喝喝茶的、站在市門的舖戶，明明掛著茶樓的新招牌，為付麼此刻連人影都沒有？不是被炸焚，為什麽此刻所有店戶還是門可羅雀呢？我把這些問題提了出來，老於　故的朱書記長說：　的確，以前這個地方是繁榮過的，那外邊的石灰墻脚，就是十年前有十萬資本的貨棧自經楊希閔亂後，給土匪搶光了。所有商店也走個淸光；這裏內的市場，以後還有了特殊的繁榮過　每天都擺滿了番　，錮寶，色仔，人也擁來將去，可謂盛極一時，政府實行禁賭後，還有些靠賭博吃飯的人視此地為禁臠，×人入境後，熱鬧更不用說。收復後博士們不得不規避了，這一班人規避後，市場冷落自在必然。』</p>
<p>我們休息了一個多鐘頭，到下午一點鐘，我們離開義和向龍華前進，雨還繼續下着，在路上戰工團的陳元瑞同志還補充了義和墟的一些特殊情形，因為他曾經在收復博羅一個月以後來這裏工作，遇見幾個土匪在搶劫，而且每日都有土匪在這裏附近搶劫。現在才沒有。</p>
<p>因此，義和給我的印象只有：「土匪，賭博，土匪。」　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c20">租界與戰爭 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>「日本之眞正仇敵，不在中國，而在中國境內之租界」，此本月六日路透社東京所傳日本報紙「都新聞」之見解也。如是云云，殆人人得由直覺斷言其為意氣之談；發於意氣，詎中事理，似可存而不論。然無問古今，無問東西，人類之史蹟為意氣所促成者多，為理智所支配者少；故在理智之倫，貴乎善馭一己之意氣，而不容漠視他人之意氣。况默察日本之對我作為，由於意氣者尤十八九；至少如啓釁蘆溝橋而遽調重軍入山海關，又如啓釁虹橋飛機塲而遽調海軍脅吳淞口，中日問題遂不可收拾而至於交戰，迄今日而為第二十四月之始矣；夫豈理智之舉？實為意氣所驅！循是言之，豈敢菲薄「都新聞」！</p>
<p>租界之於中國，不難就歷史說明其由來，就地理說明其界綫，就法理說明其本質，就治理說明其體系；然論其關係，推其影響，析其善惡禍福利害得失，則極複雜微妙之致；不但種種矛盾雜然並存·且向矛盾之多方面演進幻變於不已。為作簡明之輪廓，準確之概念，大不易也。是以歷來中外人士之於租界：乃或嚮往之，或憎惡之；或惜珍之，或敝屣之，或信以前途無量，或疑以瞬歸毀滅；或視如天堂，凡百福利之源泉；或視如地獄，凡百罪惡之淵藪。蓋以其本質之多元，遂蒙逈殊之估價：平時旣然，及中日交戰而租界本質所涵之矛盾暴露愈甚。日人對我發動武力侵略之後，在軍事經濟外交各方面。遭遇始料所不及之煩悶，姑莫謂無從解脫此煩悶之後果，抑且無從解答此煩悶之前因；不自反省而怨天尤人，天人悠悠而遷怒租界，於是若有所獲而曰仇×在此矣。</p>
<p>租界何足為日本仇×哉，我國抗戰之物質，以廣大之內地為基礎，田野邱壑森林礦產皆是也，租界如彈丸，何足道？我國抗戰之精神，在耐勞耐苦，不屈不撓，生息內地之軍民，居租界者質量俱百一耳，我國抗戰武器之輸入，自粵東陷而惟西北西南是從，豈猶賴租界為吞吐？我國抗戰之制勝，在悠久之時間，遼闊之空間；雙方勝敗之因素，全不在乎租界，申言之，今日之租界而為我人控制，何裨於抗戰，租界而為日本控制，何損於中國抗戰之前途，又何裨於日本之作戰？抑租界與戰爭，非惟無關係，且有密切關係；關係惟何：勝屬日本，則日本必視租界如禁臠，勝屬中國，則租界必以中國復興大業而空前繁榮；故謂戰爭運命，繫於租界，斷無是理；租界運命實視戰爭最後結局而轉移，是因租界在我國而謂先天註定者可也。此種密切之關係，此種必然之因果，舉世所熟知；若為意氣所驅，企圖變更租界之運命於戰局决定勝敗之前，則猶揠苗助長，手刃之不啻也。何也：保全租界端賴各方合作，而毀滅租界則任何一方優為之也。是以吾人旣勸勉租界內國人以自重，復欲正吿日人毋錯覺租界為仇敵！</p>
<p>意氣之談，無當於事理，無益於現實；但鼓煽意氣而導多人於意氣，甚至形成意氣之行動，則不但無當無益，且以誤入歧途而自貽伊戚。故中國方面若不能洞察區區租界之無關戰局，在租界內不能自重，馴至導租界於毀滅，則國際對中國之同情，將有不良之轉變。日本方面若以仇敵視租界，則租界固國際之炸彈也；日本爆炸之，行見太平洋沸騰！</p>

<h3 id="c30">求偶十誡 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>信不信由你</p>
<p>第一誡：別和頭一個男朋友或女朋友談情說愛。最好能够結交幾個異性朋友，從中比較，選擇其最好的。</p>
<p>第二誡：別追求一個叫你神經一直受刺激，時常口角，或叫你變成喜歡口角的異性。在求偶時朋，假如男女雙方並不十分和睦，那麼在成婚以後，當然更沒有白首偕老的可能了。有些情人在口角以後，又復和好如初，這的確是很好玩的。可是在結婚以後，發生意見而想要破鏡重圓，並不是什麼容易的事！</p>
<p>第三誠：別和醋性太重的異性談戀說愛。你自己也不要醋意深濃。在求偶時期，自己要有結交男女朋友的權利。同時也要議對方有結交男女朋友的同等權利。假如男女靑年在求偶時期時常發生醋意，那麽結婚以後，家庭將變成一方或雙方的監獄了。</p>
<p>第四誡：別希望婚姻能呌情人的性格改變。假如有靑年男女在婚前喜歡飲酒賭博，或做其他　事，答應在婚後改良，就使是指天發誓，婚後也是斷斷不會　行諾言的。讓他們在結婚以前，用痛改前非的行為來做他們存心改變的證據吧。不必希望婚禮會改變對方的劣根性。</p>
<p>第五誡：別作賭氣訂婚的愚舉舉。有許多女子和未婚夫鬧意見，為要叫未婚夫覺得心痛起見，便去和她所不喜歡的男子訂婚，為的祗是想報復而已。有許多男子也犯了這種毛病，為的祗是想叫他的女朋友曉得世界上女子不祗她一個。請記住，賭氣的婚姻從來不會成功的。</p>
<p>第六誡：別結婚得太快。在另外一方面，也別把婚約無限期地拖延了幾年。因為在這兩種情形之下，都有不少危機暗伏着的。</p>
<p>第七誡：別向你未來的配偶聲述你過去的錯誤，也別要求你未來的配偶懺悔他悔前的過失，因為你們兩人都不是和過去結婚的。假如你倆在身體上和精神上都巳準備妥當預備結婚，那麼過去的事應該始終埋在地下，不必發掘出來。</p>
<p>第八誡：別希望通信的求偶能有美滿的結果。在未舉行婚禮以前，雙方必須有直接的切實的認識。</p>
<p>第九誡：別和一個種挨和你相差太遠的人結婚。異族成婚是難得有美滿的結果的。</p>
<p>第十誡：別把婚姻商業化了。假如你把婚姻商業化了的話，你將發覺你在這椿交易上是大吃其虧的。</p>

<p>一九一四年，歐局已緊張時，德美航線的『凱隆齊柏號」，載着六百萬金條，到德國去，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲。在船上他倆遇到法飛行家魯蒙加羅。同時，傑克又與船上的德籍無線電員鮑佛交起朋友來。傑克在代鮑工作，接着個　消息……</p>

<p>「在現在的情形，我們能够的。英國已向德奧宣戰了。你們就停下來，否則，會於你們不利的。」</p>
<p>一陣腳步聲驚動了他，他迅速的囘轉頭來，進來的是魯蒙加羅。</p>
<p>「你在管無綫電，嗎？我猜想，那個常時肚子餓的朋友一定又去吃東西去了。啊，有消息沒有？我進來的時候，看見你正在機上工作呢。」</p>
<p>「我進來後，一點消息沒有，」傑克毫不在意地，「我正在想，一誰能用無綫電來和我開這玩笑。」一</p>
<p>「你是什麽意恩？」</p>
<p>「什麽，有人送來一個消息，說他們是英國巡洋艦依莎號，說英國已向德國宣戰了，還有——」</p>
<p>他的話還沒有說完，加羅伸開兩乎按在他肩上。「這不是開玩笑，這是事實。」</p>
<p>「這是事實？你怎麽知道？」傑克奇怪的問。</p>
<p>「好幾個月前，在外交界裏就充滿了這種氣氛，我以為早就會宣戰了呢。這就是我到美國購辦飛機的原故了。」</p>
<p>「怎麼，法國也在內嗎？」</p>
<p>「對啦，俄國也在內，俄國宣戰兩天後，就輪到法國了，這是他們所謂的協約三國，兩個已經動了。現在，所期望的英國也來了，協力抵抗那　橫的德國。」</p>
<p>「但是，你怎麽會知道得這樣多？我們離開紐約的時候，報紙上一點也沒有說起！只是奧大利和　　維亞有一點小衝突罷了。」</p>
<p>「那就是這事的起因，或者說一，那就是一根導火綫。但是，你要問我怎麽知道俄國和法國的宣戰，在這船上，知道這事的不只我一個人，船長洛克，和一些職員都知道的，也和我一樣，由無綫電得到消息。他們早在留心英國的巡洋艦，因為恐怕英國加入法俄陣線，這條德國船上有六百萬黃金，對於英國眞算得一件寳貴的俘獲品呢。朋友，有把戲看啦。」</p>
<p>「眞了不得，這機說來，方才的消息，不是開玩笑了，幷且，這條英國巡洋艦或者會俘獲了我們，取去這些財物的。」</p>
<p>「若是她能捉住我們，——　的。她會將船上的許多德國人監禁起來，將這條船帶到英國去」。</p>

<h3 id="c43">同姓 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>在中國的宗法社會裏，同姓的力量是很大的。　出一個著名的祖宗來，自稱是他的「遙遙華冑，」固然可以嚇倒人，就是在械鬥時，大喊一聲　姓×的一齊上呀！」也可以先聲奪人，博取勝利。</p>
<p>幾乎殺盡四川人的張獻忠，要和文昌帝君聯宗，遇見了張桓侯的廟，也不敢燬；殺人八百萬的黃巢，不殺姓黃的八，甚至黃岡黃梅等縣，為了頭上頂着一個黃字，也得免於屠戮：同姓之力，化及盜賊，難怪數千年來，同姓的力量不衰，而現在更有變本加厲之勢了。</p>
<p>所謂變本加厲，不是我瞎說的。有些人，除了要獲得同姓的力量，而一時又無法可想，就不得不追踪桃園，媲美三雅園，拜把通譜，以厚勢力之外，就一眼看上了許多外國大亨。據說，有名「高爾礎」的，「爾」字排行，「基礎」平等，除了和那位俄國大文　聯宗以外，還可以作為他的同胞手足。於是，於是，又有姓蕭的人，按古人「伯達伯适」之例，自名「伯歸」，或按「伯夷叔齊」之例，自名「叔歸」，以與英國的「蕭君伯納」稱兄道弟。……</p>
<p>我想，將來這也不見得不會見之於事實吧：姓「馬」的名「克是」或「服斯」；姓「張」的名「仲常」；姓「羅」的名「斯祿」；姓「史」的名「丹峯」或「靑林」；……。可惜中國除了古時有一個被人疑為印度黑炭的「墨翟」以外，現在似乎沒有姓「墨」的，除了　時有一個高臥華山的「希夷先生」以外，沒有姓「希」的，否則現代怪傑的「尊姓」，豈不是又可以藉　這些姓「墨」姓「希」的妙人，拉到我們的「百家姓」上來，蔚為盛族？</p>
<p>有人說，中國人如果眞正這樣，也沒有什麼不對，因為外國人也未嘗不如此。外國儘有許多富豪，費了大量的金錢，請人製造譜牒，來證明他們是什麽名人的後代，也儘有許多軍閥或聞人，在他們的姓名中加上Vonde，Don這類的字眼，來表示他們是什麼貴爵的子孫。他們還盛行「內婚制」，比了中國的「同姓不婚」還不如。可是這話雖然有理，却誤解了我的意思，因為我對於這樣　於聯宗通譜的人，除了竭誠稱讚以外，並不是看不起他們。這話還是設實了同姓力量的偉大，連外國也就古已有之。</p>
<p>不過外國的事情究竟飄渺得很，還是囘轉頭來仍舊說說我們自己吧。</p>
<p>有些機關裏，為某姓所把持，上至領袖，下至僕廝，大都是某姓，於是有人稱這機關為「某姓家祠」，認為這是不應該的。然而我却認為這事無妨：古時不是有「岳家軍」，「揚家將」，「薛家將」這類麼？而且古來的天下就是由一姓所把持的。所謂某姓者，以今之人而行古之道，豈非古之人歟？古之人歟？死了的人都是好的，古之人尤其好，不是「先王」，至少是個「先民」，我們實在不應該肆無忌憚，妄加譏評。</p>
<p>因此，對於這種竭力培植同姓勢力者，我除了贊同以外，還想貢獻一些意見，給他們參考參考，不知他們以為何如：</p>
<p>假使是姓「孔」的，可以拉「孔明」和「孔雀」等為挨人，因為姓「諸」的和姓「葛」的旣然都可以仰攀臥龍先生，咱姓「孔」的自然成例可援，不落人後。至於「孔雀」，漢朝的揚修早就稱牠為「孔」夫子的家禽了。同樣，姓「楊」的就可以如孔羣所說，以「楊梅」為家果；姓「韓」的不妨請「韓盧」入族。……這樣一來，貴姓的勢力便益發雄厚，人人側目而視，不敢輕侮了。</p>
<p>有一位姓「梁」的文人，不肯以「伯　」和「太素」為先祖，却願以「綠珠」「紅玉」為先姑；又有一位姓「蔣」的幕友，不肯隨便聯宗，而自認是「蔣竹山」的後裔：這些人實在其愚不可及也，理應一世沒出息。</p>
<h3 id="c44">海底的田舍 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 驥</p>
<p>數年前，荷蘭政府因為國內地寡民衆，曾和大海搏鬥，費去巨額金錢，在距陸若干里外，築成一道巨壩，然後將水抽乾，再用土塡平，現已成為一片沃土良田。這全由於荷蘭的水利工程，獨步世界，才能成功，而其魄力的偉大，也足以令人欽佩了。荷蘭費了巨大人力物力，才得到彈丸之地，這可以反映歐洲土地的寳貴。那末，擁有廣博土地，不知利用，任它荒廢，無益民衆，豈不是暴珍天物？本期Magazine　Digest轉親倫敦「聽奢」報一文，記這新地的情形，很有興趣，現在把它譯錄如下：</p>
<p>荷蘭有一處地方，八年前還是海底，現已成了繁榮的農村。數日前和我住在那裏一位荷蘭農婦茗談。境內的農舍，都由政府建造，每舍有榖倉牛欄，佈置得很淸潔。農婦請我看看他們黑白相間的母牛，共約三十頭，分排拴在一間燈光明亮的欄內，每頭旁邊，放着一個銅罐，牠們會用鼻子把罐蓋掀開，然後觸動機關，於是淸水便滔滔流出。這不是信口胡謅，我曾親見他們這種動作，農舍四周，土地平坦，阡陌縱橫，一望無際，我所到過的農村，從未見過如此整齊的由野。更有白色和鮮紅色的農舍，如疏星一般，點綴其間，相映成趣，磗砌的幽靜的路上，常有汽車風馳電掣而過。凡此情形，令人推想不到幾年之前，這裏還是海底哩。</p>
<p>在這海底的田莊，現在已有自來水和電燈，明年電話也可造成。這一切的舒適安全，全靠造在荷蘭西海濱間長二十六哩的一道巨壩，它擋住北海之水，而把ZuyderZee化成一道淸水湖，這湖的部分，至少還未開墾。</p>
<p>荷蘭政府在完成大工之前，曾在海中造成下島，後來把堤壩逐漸展廣，直到成了一個狹口而止。北海的急流從這狹口湧入，其勢很猛，封閉這狹口，功極艱鉅，每次把砂石傾下，都被海　去。但一次復一次，到底把這狹口封閉成功，現在北海之水已對它屈服·農夫安詳在田中耕種，農婦靜坐在家中，聽那無綫電播音，安享快樂田舍之幸福。她們吿訴我，第一灣中之水，費了六個月的光陰，才能抽乾，然後以兩年之久，將土中所含的鹽，搜括　　。起初因為泥土鬆濕，不能用馬耕種，就用機器代馬，自此以後，大麥小麥雀麥等田，逐步出現。因為這地是由海成陸，所以發生多許奇異問題，其中之一，便是魚問題，例如Zuyder　Zee妁魚，原是鹹水魚，現在却變成鮮水魚了。</p>
<h3 id="c45">深入與獨創 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>在　苦的時代中，　起自由解放的大　，　寫許多可泣可歌的壯士，成功的偉績，或悲痛的犧牲，探尋千千萬萬顆活躍的心房，把他們在槍林彈雨中迫促的呼吸移寫到紙上，揭發了那些戴着假面具內部已經腐臭的走肉行屍，剝晚下他們醜惡的遮掩，無論你是雕刻一座美麗的豐碑，抑或暴　　魂的醜態，你都需要更深入，使讀者為美麗而謳歌，為醜惡而切齒。</p>
<p>自然不僅現在，文學的主要效能一向是需要讀者被感染的。一個有能力，不苟且的作家，决不願意讀者在看到作品後，淡然漠然。往往一種作品的成功，常是讀老做了他們精神的俘虜。作者的情緒，他們能體會；作者的意境，他們也能再現。因此作者的努力並不徒然，他們多努力一分，讀者便多一分好處。</p>
<p>作品使讀者感動，因素自然有多端·丟開欣賞的程度不談，卽就作者方面說，約有技巧的純熟，生活的　富，靈感的迸發，觀察的深入種種。這幾種因素內，依我看來，比較還是觀察深入最為切要，而且在目下，一部分文藝多少有點公式化，說來我們也需要這一劑補樂。</p>
<p>儘管我們文藝的內容有一個共同傾向，但寫出來的各　面目斷不可因襲雷同。這便是說儘管「同歸」，但必須『殊途』。</p>
<p>給人印象模糊的基因，常是由於作者的茍且和忽略。觀察一件事態，不能從中抽取出核心，對於人格的分析，不够深入，黏着於浮面，再加受文字的因襲，往往不知不覺間利用許多已成的語彙，這自然是一件偷懶的事，然而為了敎育力量妁支配，人人都容易犯偷懶的毛病·尤其在目下抗戰文藝的現階段中，我們有許多機會看到同一種型態的文字，這一本雜誌，那一種副刊上，我們看了很多很多，耳濡目染間，不知不覺我們接受了文化的因襲，稍不小心的話，我們一下筆時就會把別人文章　人物混和到自己文章轟來，把已成的語彙，在不知不覺間也引用了，結果是你不能集中全力來獨創一個『自己的人格』。你的『人格』顯得平凡，通俗，毫無特殊之處。</p>
<p>渥茲華斯在『抒情詩歌集』的序言裏說：『在生活的事態上，加上一層想像的光彩，使日常的東西在不常的狀態下顯現出來·』這話看似神秘，實際上也不　是叫我們避免平凡。祗要我們能細心體會，樑龍取珠，根本天下間就决沒有平凡的事物。有雷同才有平凡，雷同還是怪你末曾深入。可見袛要作者有耐心，能從中取異，一切平凡皆可化為不平凡。這種不平凡就是你的獨創。</p>
<p>末了，我須略提一提深入的方法。依渥茲華斯說，可利用想像，但這祗合於象徵主義的方法，也祗有詩中蛟為適宜，至少在我們現代的中國，我們是需要面對着你大的現實的。</p>
<p>讓我來轉抄一段莫泊桑引證弗祿培爾的話，說明深入的方法：『才能能是一種悠久的耐性！這事是在相當長久地並且相當注意地凝視着自己想要表現的一切，以便從那裏面發現一種還不曾被任何人見過和說過的狀態，因為我們使用自己眼睛時，總免不了憶起前人對於我們所注視的東西的意見，所以在一切東西裏面都還有着未曾被人探險過的處所，極微的事物也包含着少許未知的地方，去尋出他來罷。為着描寫一道正在燃燒着的火，和一株生在平原的樹，我們便得一直面對着這火和這樹，待到牠們在我們眼中同任何旁的樹和旁的火，顯得不同才止。』去尋出他來罷。我們該面對着些什麽呢？</p>
<p>為了深入與獨創，有可能的話，最好你還是多看一點現實，免得在家裏閉門造車。</p>

<p>— 未明</p>
<p>經過了長長的狼狽的奔走以後，又終於喘息着在這兒停下來。</p>
<p>×，你要笑我吧。是的，我自己也不懂得自已為什末？我是變了，常常會無端獨自悵惘半天，不說也不動，呆望着白雲或是星星出神。處在這樣的「籠子」裏，周圍陰森森　，從窗子望到外面，一切全像給塗了一層暗灰色，於是人也如塗了重暗灰色，時感陣陣寒冷之來襲。</p>
<p>你是知道我深愛着故鄉的雨的，近來我更懷念着了。人在寂寞的當兒，前塵影事自然會兜上心來，卽使瑣雜得可笑的細微的事情，都能使我憶戀，而現在正是故鄉的雨的季節喲！</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>陽光畏怯地收去抹在楊柳梢頭的黃金，旋風若胡哨一陣緊一陣的時候，就如潤澤心靈的雨！我稱他為潤澤心靈的雨不是無因的，而我正需要　牠呀！向我遞了個拜帖，於是捧了本心愛的書躺在屋後竹園中的榻上，靜靜地　聽如心弦彈奏出來的微妙的雨聲，玩味着哀怨而美麗的詩句，注意力是被他們各分了一半去。</p>
<p>嗒！嗒，滴在鮮艷得快要溶下來的尖尖的葉片上，似乎在講一個古代的甜美的故事，然後再墜下去，每次都迸出渾圓的淸脆的音響。睜開眼，便有一道閃亮的白光跳過來，那是環繞竹園的小溪，晶瑩一如漂亮的銀帶，雨點碰到他面龐，立刻躍動着微笑的波紋，讓微雨撫摩我底頭髮，我是眞的悟出「智者樂水」的意義了。</p>
<p>我也喜歡雨霽後爽朗舒適的氣息，洗凈過的葉片底耀眼的靑翠，顯得更嬌嫩並且發怒地茁長着的小草。</p>
<p>我沒有勇氣囘憶，寫給你，是用了痛苦的調子伸訴着的，還揚起淡淡的哀愁如輕雲呢。</p>

<p>四、蜀道難</p>
<p>過石佛山，卽逐漸入于深山高谷中，越走越為崇山峻嶺，四面八方，毫無人烟，亦無樹木，但見石壁巍峨，聳立雲霄，使人頓起雄偉壯大之感。公路蜿蜒曲折，儘往山峯上爬，故車行甚慢。我們陶醉于前後左右的風光欣賞中，忘記了車行多少時候了。已而，我們發見已爬上了山頂，側頭俯視，峭壁千　，望不到底，任是怎樣身體健康，心臟强健的人，一看了這望不到底的險境，就立刻會全身酸軟，支持不住了。司機人雖然走慣走熟了這種險路，但他之絕不稍敢側視，尤為當然。因為他如果稍一側視，必會心頭一歡，眼睛一化，便把車子開到谷底去，連人帶車，變成了粉碎了。到了這裏，乘客中也只有那幾位大阻的，才敢稍為看一下。看過後，你一句，他一句，說著怎樣危險，萬一掉下去，就怎樣怎樣了的話，那位年紀五十上下，帶着五個男女小孩的老婦人就迷信地說道：</p>
<p>『別多　！別多嘴！大家都平安。』</p>
<p>她的二女和三女，年紀雖只不過十三四，却很頑皮。她們說：</p>
<p>「媽媽，我們要看看。」</p>
<p>身傍那位靑年男客卽刻拉　那小的的雙手，說道：</p>
<p>「小妹妹，別往下看，往上看吧，山頂上有白雲繞着山頭飛舞，有鳥雀歌唱，又有太陽，旣暖和，又明亮。」</p>
<p>做母親的隨卽跟着說道：</p>

<p>延醫診理　通融辦法</p>
<p>而兄弟以居民多屬貧乏、難覓西醫、間或醫院無位收留、因此據情與衛生醫官妥商、要求通融辦理、如病者在半夜或日間危急時、可否准請中醫調理、惟醫理後該中醫或病者親屬卽時或於翌日任便一人往書信館三樓皇家衛生醫官處報吿、以便塡冊、塡冊後、皇家必將病者抬往西環堅尼地城或對海荔枝角傳染病院、經三幾天後、方准囘家、以免病者傳染于同樓住客也、此辦法已蒙允准、特此通吿、仰各居民照此辦理、免干港例、是為至要、今年現下經已往上列地點打針者有十萬人之多、另有許多居民能力所及、自行延醫注射者、本港居民於夏天炎熱之際、每好海浴、但非係離城市較遠淸潔海水者、不宜海浴、因近來本港新建房屋、多設水厠由是舊溺流入海中、致海邊之水稍為不潔、如沾染之、亦能生病也、兄弟極望各位男女盡力照本文所講、打針及防範之法、大家合力去做、庶免蔓延太多、倘不防患未然、萬一不幸、霍亂症劇烈流行、斯時各國勢必認香港為疫症埠、由本港開行之輪船抵到各埠、須入禁海施行滅疫工作、如此則無論旅客及輪船公司、皆受損失、因此來往香港之輪船、勢不能不加增費用、以資彌袖、由是香港粮食價必高漲、同時必發生諸多不利之環境、此不過舉少一端、有此利弊關係、兄弟以萬分熱誠、希望同胞合力防止撲滅霍亂症、一則可保自已生命、二則可保社會安寧、三則可保香港繁榮、此兄弟之厚望也、</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>這是一個喜訊：</p>
<p>『抗戰中國』是中央攝影場的出品，發音，光綫……電影藝術的條件都十分美滿。內容取材方面，是奮鬥的中國，新生的中國的事實。日前，該片在中央戲院試影招待文化界，令觀者好像投進祖國的懷抱，全場空氣緊張，感奮。大家全都受到光明的溫暖，蒸發着勝利的光輝。自今天起，「抗戰中國」就在中央戲院正式公映了。為使我們親愛的僑胞接受祖國新的洗禮，記者義無容辭地謹向讀者作一個概要的報道：</p>
<p>「抗戰中國」全片共分五輯：是由最近時事片和戰地片所組成的。</p>
<p>第一輯，沙王抵渝就職，顯示全國空前的團結。三民主義靑年團參加植樹禮，象徵「十年樹木，百年樹人」是我們的大計。看了國民宣誓，可以發見潛伏在每個角落裏的偉大的力量，文協的年會和老舍的會務報吿，這無異是給我們文化工作者一個親切的鼓勵。兒童節中的小主人是多麽天眞活潑，白市勞軍，又是多麽使人興奮。</p>
<p>第二輯，×人轟炸之後無情的火燄猛烈地燃燒着。新垣殘壁，死屍積野，令人觸目傷心，悲從中來。「只有仇恨」，一只有雪恥一，『抗戰到底』，「以牙還牙」，有熱有力的誓語，使觀衆發生了共嗚，掌聲雷動起來。重慶英領事館亦遭轟炸之殃，讓有眼晴者看出×人的眞面目。少女，學生殷勤地為出征將士縫補衣服，服務團在轟炸之後施賑茶粥，軍民打成一片，這又是多麼使人感奮。</p>
<p>第三輯，是在開五中全會。蔣委員長和黨國領袖如李宗仁，白崇禧，馮玉祥，陳誠，……在銀慕上出現，一陣陣的掌聲反映民衆對於領袖和高級將領的愛戴。蔣委員長那堅毅而剴切的指示，使全場觀衆有如親受訓話。五中全會的宣言有謂：「黨的本身須刻苦，謙虛，勇敢，勇為。」深願黨員仰體領袖的意旨，以身作則，我們全國同胞亦要身體力行，互相砥礪，腐敗的中國死去了！活潑的中國新生了！</p>
<p>第四輯，在嚴肅中有活潑，在緊張中有趣味，新生活展覽會除吿訴我們：國產的藥品與機械已經突飛猛進地走上科學化的大道之外，合理化的衣食住亦饒有意趣，樸實整齊的男女服裝堂堂表示：「這是我們中國的！」中西合壁的自助餐亦是進步的好現象，衛生的住屋正顯示未來的新中國，是將這樣提高大衆的生活水準，集體結婚，不消說亦是有趣的一幕。</p>
<p>在婦女獻金運動中，除蔣夫人演講外，委員長又在熱烈的掌聲中致詞。得有一個很長的時間瞻仰領袖的尊嚴，這正可滿足每一個國民的盼望，受了領袖的感召，對於國運的前途益覺樂觀。</p>
<p>勵志社的音樂會奏十分悅耳動聽。歌詠隊歌詠「抗戰到底」中，有「有槍拿槍，有筆拿筆」的警句昭示我們，『四萬萬人一條心』亦是烙印在每個觀衆的腦際。</p>
<p>第五輯，是勝利的前奏，有「南海風雲」和廣州武漢的眞情實景，喚起我們眷戀祖國的囘憶，游擊隊和正規軍在衝鋒陷暉時，掌聲最為熱烈，這是還我河山的先兆。</p>
<p>還有晉南軍民慶祝勝利大會，騎兵精采的表演，紅槍會的民間正氣，西安的俘虜收容所，西北囘民的献旗參加抗戰，亦都是不可多得的活生生的材料。</p>
<p>我們的祖國是這樣奮鬥，這樣偉大，這樣光明，這樣進步，深願不忘本的僑胞都參觀「抗戰中國」，接受祖國新的洗禮吧！</p>

<p>（本報特訊）許承基乃於一九三五年出國的當他未出國前、已有人對於他的前程曾談及過、謂他是個天才網球家、假如有人能肯出一筆款、送他去歐美各國遊歷、與各國名手競賽切磋、則他的技術必更進步、說不定會臻上世界十傑之林、而爲體育落後的中國在海外爭一點光榮、</p>
<p>後來他果得教育部資遺出國、在法國某一個地方半工半讀、生活頗廣苦、然而、他是個大可造就的靑年、並不受環境所束縛、常爲自己的前程而奮鬥、</p>
<p>不久　教育部已停止他的津貼費、幸旅居爪哇方面的華僑、對於他素肯幫助、常寄匯多少旅費、給他做生活、因此、他乃不致中途返國、仍留在海外、努力向他偉大的前程邁進、直至現在、差不多沒一國的網球界不識許承基的大名了、</p>
<p>他留歐期內、戰勝過各國名將、在不少數、英國的奧斯丁、也曾一散于其手、</p>
<p>今年的惠勃爾頓網球賽、將開始舉行、據一般的推測、今年之晉達最後四人者、當爲奧斯丁、孟察爾、潘塞克及亨列格、此外若德國之亨克爾、我國之許承基、法國之貝脫拉及披里蔡、均有相當希望、</p>

<h3 id="e1">General Yan Xishan: Consolidating Mass Organizations to Lay the Foundation for Victory <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(I) New Tasks Under the New Situation</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has now entered a new phase. The main characteristics of this new phase of the War of Resistance are: First, the attacking power of the Japanese has not yet been lost, and the Japanese's attacking attempts have not yet stopped. However, due to the improvement of our strategic and tactical methods and the huge consumption of Japanese troops and materials, as well as the increasing dispersal of their forces, the attacking power of the Japanese is gradually increasing with new difficulties, and it is gradually shifting from strategic offensive to strategic conservatism. Whether this possibility can be quickly realized, of course, depends on the degree of our efforts. Second, although our country has lost more land and increased more difficulties, in the national revolutionary war, it has removed many obstacles to the vitality of the nation, cultivated new revolutionary forces, created some conditions for the victory of the War of Resistance, and laid a preliminary foundation for the emerging country; however, it is still not enough. Although there are conditions, they are not perfect, and although there is a foundation, it is not solid. Although the new revolutionary forces have grown, they cannot be refined. Third, as the Japanese's offensive becomes increasingly difficult, they will inevitably turn to suppressing the anti-Japanese forces in their rear to consolidate their occupied areas. In this way, the anti-Japanese forces fighting in the Japanese rear will suffer more difficulties. This is the new situation of our War of Resistance.</p>
<p>General Yan Xishan: Consolidating Mass Organizations to Lay the Foundation for Victory</p>
<p>What is the development prospect of this new situation of the War of Resistance? I believe that the most likely prospect is: First, although the Japanese attempt to continue to penetrate deeper, in the course of the war, the Japanese will gradually turn from strong to weak, and we will gradually turn from weak to strong, forcing the Japanese to stop their offensive and turn to a conservative state. Second, our country's new revolutionary forces will become more refined, the conditions for the victory of the War of Resistance will become more perfect, and the foundation of the emerging country will become more solid. In short, the time for the success of the national revolution is getting closer. Third, the Japanese will do their best to attack the anti-Japanese forces in their rear. However, the anti-Japanese forces fighting in the Japanese rear will become more united, more consolidated, more developed, and stronger, creating powerful conditions for the future recovery of lost territories. However, this bright future can only be achieved through the efforts of our people across the country. Otherwise, it may also lead to the most difficult and worst path, delaying the progress of the national revolution's victory.</p>
<p>How can we strive for the bright future mentioned above? For the whole country, we should, on the one hand, launch a full-scale War of Resistance, stop the Japanese's continued offensive, and embark on the path of turning defense into offense and turning defeat into victory. On the other hand, we should strengthen domestic unity, continue to reform politics, accelerate economic construction, mobilize the whole people to participate in the cause of the War of Resistance and national construction, create a large number of modernized new armies with a foundation, and finally launch a counter-offensive to recover lost territories. For the Second War Zone, we should establish a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area nationwide as a fortress in North China and a fortress for the whole country, fulfilling a part of our responsibility to the country and the nation. To achieve this, I believe that we must establish a modernized iron army with 300,000 troops with a foundation and consolidate a million mass organizations. This is our new task under the new situation.</p>
<p>(II) Establishing a Sound and Consolidated Guerrilla Base Area and Consolidating Mass Organizations</p>
<p>As mentioned above, establishing a modernized iron army with a foundation and consolidating mass organizations are the two major foundations for establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area. I don't want to say much about the issue of establishing an iron army here, and I will discuss it in another article in the future. Here, I want to briefly discuss the issue of establishing a guerrilla base area and consolidating mass organizations.</p>
<p>I believe that it is impossible to establish a guerrilla base area without the masses. Establishing a guerrilla base area requires establishing a modernized iron army with a foundation, but without the participation and replenishment of the masses, without the masses to help the army fight, the iron army cannot exert its power. Establishing a guerrilla base area requires a consolidated and progressive regime, but without the masses to maintain the regime and promote the regime, our regime will collapse. Establishing a guerrilla base area requires economic construction, but without the participation and support of the masses, economic construction will fail. Establishing a guerrilla base area requires eliminating internal traitors and preventing foreign traitors, but without the masses to patrol and report, the work of eliminating traitors cannot be carried out effectively. Even if it is carried out reluctantly, it will be twice the effort with half the results. From this, it can be seen that the masses are an important condition for establishing a guerrilla base area.</p>
<p>But I want to further point out that in order to enable the masses to participate and help the army, maintain and promote the regime, participate and support economic construction, and carry out the work of eliminating traitors, it is impossible not to organize the masses. Therefore, we say that establishing a guerrilla base area not only requires the masses, but also requires organized masses.</p>
<p>As early as during the War of Resistance in Suiyuan, I put forward the slogan of organizing a million masses, advocating the extensive organization of the masses under a unified will to concentrate manpower and assume the mission of national revolution. In the past two years, although Shanxi's mass organizations have made some achievements, the foundation is still too weak and not solid enough.</p>
<p>Today's War of Resistance situation urgently requires us to establish a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area, and this major task of establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area urgently requires us to have a consolidated and extensive mass organization. It cannot be denied that the consolidation of Shanxi's mass organization today is not enough to meet the needs of establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area. Therefore, I put forward the slogan of consolidating a million mass organizations today.</p>
<p>In short, establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area and consolidating mass organizations are inseparable. Consolidating mass organizations is a basic condition for establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area. Without consolidating mass organizations, establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area is empty talk.</p>
<p>(III) Review of Shanxi's Mass Organizations in the Past Two Years</p>
<p>I believe that the development of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years can be divided into three stages. The period from the establishment of the Public Sacrifice Society to the fall of Taiyuan is one stage. In this stage, Shanxi's mass organizations were universally established. From the village administration assistants and special commissioners who successively went to the countryside to work, the masses who were previously ignorant began to wake up. Shanxi's masses went from a state of not caring about national affairs to a state of enthusiastically participating in the Public Sacrifice Society. This is the first development of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years. The period from the fall of Taiyuan to the fall of Linfen is another stage. In this stage, many new mass salvation groups were universally established in various places, such as the Peasant Salvation Association, the Worker Salvation Association, the Youth Salvation Association, the Children's Salvation Association, and the Women's Salvation Association. These mass salvation groups played a great role in promoting and supporting Shanxi's War of Resistance. The organization of the Self-Defense Force has also become more壮大了and more enriched. On the basis of the Public Sacrifice Society, a political mass salvation group, more various mass salvation groups were organized according to the different interests and characteristics of the masses. This is the second development of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years. The period from the fall of Linfen to the present is another stage. In this stage, all kinds of mass salvation groups formally joined the Public Sacrifice Society and became members of the Public Sacrifice Society. At the same time, various mass salvation groups have also established their own senior leadership organs one after another. Shanxi's mass organizations, whether in politics or organization, have gradually moved from a relatively chaotic and scattered state to a relatively orderly and unified state. This is the third development of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years. The third stage is not yet over and is still continuing to develop.</p>
<p>From what has been said above, the development and progress of Shanxi's mass organizations in recent years has been quite rapid. In the past two years, in terms of quantity, Shanxi's mass organizations have reached a million masses or even exceeded a million. In terms of quality, Shanxi's masses have progressed from ignorance to awareness, and from awareness to the ability to take action in part.</p>
<p>Here I want to briefly explain that the main reason why Shanxi's mass organizations have been able to develop and progress like this in the past two years is because they have the following advantages: First, the various mass salvation groups in Shanxi in the past two years have grown and become stronger in the battle with the Japanese. Therefore, it is full of combat effectiveness. Second, they are all democratic and centralized organizations. Third, their organizational work can generally be linked to the actual life of the masses. Fourth, their relationship with the government is generally very good.</p>
<p>But I want to solemnly point out that although the development and progress of Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years has been very fast, its weaknesses are also very big and very many.</p>
<p>The first major weakness of Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years is the lack of in-depth and practical political mobilization and organizational work. The lack of in-depth and practical political mobilization makes the organizational work only have a framework and lack strength. The lack of in-depth and practical organizational work makes the political mobilization only have slogans and lack content. These two weaknesses work together, resulting in a huge weakness, that is, political weakness and organizational fragility. This is a huge crisis for Shanxi's mass organizations.</p>
<p>The second major weakness of Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years is the disorganization and weakness of organizational leadership. Various mass salvation groups have not established their respective highest leadership organs in a relatively long period of time (although the General Labor Union has recently resumed work and the Provincial Peasant Salvation Association is being prepared, they have not yet embarked on the path of unified leadership and still need to continue to work hard). This inevitably hinders the unity and strengthening of the leadership of the mass organizations, and also hinders the greater development of the mass organizations.</p>
<p>The second major weakness of Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years is the lack of selection, cultivation, and training of cadres, especially local cadres. In the past two years, although a lot of new mass movement cadres have been produced, they are far behind the actual needs, especially the local cadres are too few. In this way, it is not easy to quickly organize many of the masses who have not yet been organized. Even for the masses who have already been organized, it is impossible to grasp them and use them. The combination of these three major weaknesses has formed a major problem for Shanxi's mass organizations at present, that is, more in name than in reality, and outwardly strong but inwardly weak. In other words, it is not consolidated. If this major problem cannot be overcome in the future, Shanxi's mass organizations will not only fail to develop and progress rapidly, but will gradually weaken and decline.</p>
<p>(IV) Basic Principles for Consolidating a Million Mass Organizations</p>
<p>I have already said before that in order to establish a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area, we must quickly consolidate the mass organizations. After reviewing Shanxi's mass organizations in the past two years, we found that the biggest problem of Shanxi's mass organizations is that they are not consolidated. In this way, the task of consolidating a million mass organizations cannot but become very important and urgent.</p>
<p>I believe that in order to consolidate a million mass organizations, we must first determine the following general principles:</p>
<p>First, consolidating a million mass organizations should be aimed at establishing a sound and consolidated guerrilla base area. All work should be done in this direction.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Current State of Education in the Yao Mountains of Guangxi <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Xue</p>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) Recently, I had the opportunity to enter the Yao areas of Guiping and Xiang counties in Guangxi and visit a dozen or so national elementary schools established in the "Special Education Zone." It would be impossible to represent Guangxi's implementation of minority education with just such a narrow area and such a small number of schools. However, the number of problems found in these schools is enough to make people think deeply and provides valuable research material.</p>
<p>Guangxi's overall plan requires that any county that has Miao or Yao mountain areas must designate these minority residential areas as "Special Education Zones." The county government, based on local topography, transportation, population, and school-age children, delineates school zones, draws maps, and provides explanations, which are then submitted to the Provincial Department of Education for approval before schools can be established. In the first two years after the school is established, if the county funds are insufficient, the county can also submit a request to the Department of Education for subsidies based on the circumstances. It is said that this plan has not changed from the 23rd year of the Republic to the present, and the number of schools subsidized by the province has reached more than 540, which shows how actively the Guangxi authorities are promoting the education of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>However, because the plan to train Miao and Yao children and send them back to their original places to run education is progressing very slowly, most of the educators in the special education zone are still Han Chinese. Therefore, there are more and more complex problems.</p>
<p>First, they are not familiar with the life of the Yao mountains. Once they run into the deep mountains and valleys, they naturally cannot get used to living there. Therefore, the teachers have to go out of the mountains at least once a month and stay for eight to ten days or even twenty days. According to the author's visit to the mountains, I have been to nine schools, and only two schools' teachers were seen because we asked them to be guides and they led us in from outside the mountains. The other six schools did not even see the shadows of the teachers. According to the local Yao people, "They went out of the mountains!"</p>
<p>Second, because the life of the Yao mountains is very boring in the eyes of outsiders, at a time when there is a shortage of cadres everywhere, it cannot be said that there are no teachers who are more knowledgeable in the mountains; but it cannot be said that there are no people who are just making up the numbers. In the winter of the year before last, the author met a principal (and teacher) in the Yao mountains. He wrote a "limit document" (a note limiting the time to pay money) for the Yao people, about sixty words. I read it several times and could not even figure out the general meaning. Later, I asked the Yao people who showed me the note, and he told me the general meaning of the document, and I knew what was going on. But the author's visit to the mountains this time found that the teacher was still teaching in the Yao mountains, which is really lamentable!</p>
<p>Third, there is also a need for improvement in teaching. For example, in the southeast of Xiang County, although there are schools, there are very few students, some with only five or six students, and they cannot come to school every day. This is the case in Liuxiang and Huashan villages. In addition, in some places, Yao children are willing to go to school, but because the teachers are not suitable, there are students at school, but no teachers to teach, such as Shang Guchen and Xia Guchen villages. As for what to teach? Apart from asking students to recite a few sentences from the textbook, there are few opportunities to write.</p>
<p>Fourth, the school equipment should be as complete as possible. In the southeast of Xiang County, except for the Liuxiang village where the township office is located, which has a school building that can accommodate ten or so students, there are no school buildings in other villages. And the folk houses used are pitifully narrow. Even if there is a room, there are no tables and chairs inside. Apart from a small square blackboard, you can't see anything else. It is said that the provincial subsidy is mostly used for school equipment. I hope it will be purchased immediately. In the Yao mountains of Guiping, most of the places where schools have been established have a school building, and there are already desks, chairs, blackboards, and other items. However, when it comes to equipment, there is also a need for improvement.</p>
<p>Fifth, in addition to teaching students to read textbooks, teachers generally do not pay attention to the lives of the Yao people. For example, when infectious diseases are prevalent in the Yao mountains, causing many people to be sick, the teachers are helpless. If they can use medicine to treat the Yao people's suffering, not only will the teacher be immediately respected by the Yao people, but wouldn't it be a great opportunity to start improving the sanitation of the Yao village?</p>
<p>Sixth, the Yao mountains are always in the remote areas of the county, and Yao education is not regarded as different from general basic education, or it is thought that the education in the Yao mountains can be run as well as the education outside the mountains. In fact, this view is wrong. Obviously, up to now, the situation of Yao mountain society and non-Yao mountain society is fundamentally different. How can we regard them as the same? To force them to have the same facilities will result in neither black nor white, but will hinder the progress of special education. In addition, some people are too pessimistic about Yao education, thinking that it will not be done well anyway, so why bother. The government wants the county to do special education, and the county government just wants to do it and be done with it. They have no time to ask about all the problems that occur during the implementation of special education.</p>
<p>In summary, some people may blame the author for being too demanding. The author is very clear that Yao mountain education has only been run for a short history of four years, so naturally there are still many places that are not done well enough. I am writing this in the hope that everyone can strive for improvement. Here are my personal opinions for your reference:</p>
<p>First, the county government must understand the provincial government's painstaking efforts to develop the education of ethnic minorities. Within the scope of possibility, it should list more construction funds for the Yao mountains in the county budget, especially education funds. In particular, ethnic equality and nationalism must be promoted as much as possible to eliminate the centuries-old isolation between the Han and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Second, the provincial government should immediately proceed with selecting and training minority children so that the overall plan can be easily completed. When it is still necessary to borrow talent from the Han, the candidates must be carefully selected. They must not only be knowledgeable but also have a creative spirit. They must not only have a passion for work but also be able to endure hardship. They must not only have the ability to teach but also have a plan and steps to transform Yao society. On the other hand, within the scope of the county's finances, the salaries of these teachers who are responsible for special education should be increased so that they can solve the minimum level of life and be able to serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Third, the teachers who are sent to work in the Yao mountains and Miao caves should preferably use examination methods to select outstanding individuals and concentrate on short-term training. In the training, not only should we focus on education, but also on politics. Moreover, we must go to the mountains to actually investigate the situation of Yao society and bring the problems found in the mountains back to the classroom to study and seek solutions. After the training is over, there must be a special education research association. In the future, when they go to work in the mountains, they will be scattered, but they must also have a contact. Every few months, members must gather again to report on their work experience and discuss problems that they cannot solve individually. In this way, not only can the loneliness of those who are educated in the mountains be reduced, but also new vitality can be added, so that everyone will not dare to slack off in their work, and there will be ways to seek solutions to problems.

<h3 id="e3">The Yi Affairs of Ning Province, Xikang, Deserve Serious Attention <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Kangding Correspondence) The nationalities in Kang and Lian provinces are very complex. The people in the Kang area are more pure because they worship Buddhism, and government decrees can still be implemented. However, the savage Yi people of Ning province are extremely fierce and difficult to govern. According to the research of various Chinese historians and overseas scholars such as Stevenson and Boughton, it is still uncertain what the origin of the Yi people is. It is believed that the theory that they are an inherent Chinese nation is correct. The Yi people take the Liang Mountains as the center and are distributed along the Jinsha River and Dadu River, as well as in more than ten counties in Leima Ping'e and Ning province. They all have their strong forces. It is generally estimated that there are no less than a million people who are hot-blooded, white, and black. Because the people are fierce and unruly, the rulers in the past have always regarded them as people outside the law. According to historical records, since the Shu kingdom drove out the Man people, the Yi people have been regarded as a major problem for the country in all dynasties. Some used force to conquer them, some used education to subdue them, some divided land to guard them, and some awarded titles to pacify them. All of them implemented the policy of suppression and appeasement. However, the Yi people were cunning and treacherous, and their rebellions were constant, so they were never able to make them submit and return with joy. Moreover, their strength grew and spread. The incidents of attacking cities and looting towns, robbing and killing merchants, and driving out Han people to occupy land increased with the times. In the past, even with the rich financial resources and strong military force of Sichuan province, it was still felt to be thorny and unable to achieve the effect of suppression and appeasement. The severity of the disaster can be imagined. In the past, although garrisons were set up to prevent them from invading, hoping for temporary peace, there was never active assimilation, making a once and for all plan, so that the country has more than a million simple, brave, and strong Yi people, but it cannot use them. On the contrary, because of their kidnapping, not only are the Han people uneasy, but also the local resources cannot be developed, which is lamentable. After the Xikang Provincial Government took over Ning province, in view of the mistakes of the past passive policy, it should be corrected urgently. During the current period of full-scale War of Resistance, in order to meet the needs of rear area construction, a proactive policy was adopted, and it was decided to completely assimilate the Yi people and completely establish governance in the Yi area. The steps to be taken are to first send capable soldiers to conquer the stubborn and murderous savage Yi people to establish prestige, and then use political power to gradually influence the savage Yi people of Ning province. Since Deng Xiuting, the commander of the Border Pacification Command, led his troops to suppress the Yi bandits around Xichang to Ningnan, they have gradually been wiped out. The remaining Yi bandits have surrendered and are willing to sit as hostages to show their faith. According to recent Ningfang intelligence, the Xining Avenue has been completely cleared. It is heard that Liu Wenhui, the chairman of the Provincial Government, plans to inspect Ning province in the near future to guide the assimilation of the Yi people in the area and promote the establishment of governance in the Yi area. The reporter recently visited the Provincial Government and interviewed Liu to inquire about the implementation guidelines and methods for Yi affairs. Liu said that there are more than a million Yi people in Ning province. They have no religion, no writing, and their actions are no different from animals. They have been a problem for the border for a long time. Since the implementation of both suppression and appeasement, the Xining Avenue has recently been completely cleared, and the suppression is now advancing towards the Huili area. Once the Xihui Road is open, we will seek to open the Yuejun Road. In the future, we plan to gradually change the Yi areas of Huili, Yanyuan, and Yanbian into governance. Because the area is very large, more than a dozen counties can be established. For handling Yi affairs, we focus on politics. The newly organized Xikang Ning Province Reclamation Committee is now an important political organization. As for Liu's inspection trip to Ning province, he plans to first go to Hanyuanchang to preside over the unity of protection and training of cadres training class. The training matters are scheduled for a period of one month, and then he will go directly to Xichang to inspect the counties in Ning province and supervise Yi affairs and reclamation matters.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Reporter Li Zhuang of the People's Revolutionary Society: Please Look at Today's Beiping and Tianjin - Darkness and Light Intertwined <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>I. Transportation Controlled by × People</p>
<p>(Hebei North Communication) From Xietai (Shunde) to Tianjin, before the incident, it was only a two-day train journey, but now it takes at least four or five days. The railway tracks are often destroyed by our guerrillas, so repairing the road is necessary while driving the train. Sometimes, when a larger railway bridge is destroyed, it might take as long as ten days or half a month.</p>
<p>These are truly unbearable four or five days! Traitors and × troops can accuse you of being suspicious at any time. In other words, there is always the danger of being arrested. Train derailments or attacks are commonplace, and ordinary people on the train are often implicated by the × troops on board.</p>
<p>If you want to go out, you must first obtain the qualification to go out, a "Good Citizen Certificate," a certificate from the pseudo-county government, and guarantees from two shops.</p>
<p>After getting on the train, you have to go through very strict inspections on the train. Whether it's luggage or suitcases, everything has to be opened to check for contraband. When the police—Chinese—inspect—if there are no Japanese soldiers present, they often do it perfunctorily. When there is an opportunity, they often complain to the people being inspected: There's no way, we are all Chinese, who would willingly be a traitor? But they force you to the point where you have no choice, you can't even run away. The conclusion is often exciting! Don't rush, wait and see, when there's a chance, I'll show them!</p>
<p>If you are unlucky enough to encounter a plainclothes traitor inspecting, then you are extremely unlucky. Most of them wear long robes and top hats, with bayonets in their hands, and are often followed by fully armed Japanese soldiers. If they don't like the look of you, they will search everything, even your crotch or socks. When opening boxes and unpacking luggage, if they think you are "too slow!" they will unceremoniously use their bayonets to open them for you.</p>
<p>When Chinese people board the train, they must line up in an orderly manner, supposedly to prevent chaos. Of course, the Japanese have the priority to board the train first, followed by the Koreans, and finally the Chinese. And they must proceed in an orderly single file. If the Japanese don't have seats, the Chinese must immediately give up their seats to them, otherwise, they risk getting slapped in the face.</p>
<p>At the front and back of each passenger train, there are two armored cars each, and in front of the two armored cars in the front, there are also three or four troop cars with Japanese soldiers sitting on them. Their mission, it is said, is to guard against bandits on the one hand, and to boast about the large number of the "Imperial Army" and demonstrate to the people on the other. In reality, it's always the same few people going back and forth. On the same train, for example, running from Shijiazhuang to Beiping, and then from Beiping to Shijiazhuang, only when they are killed by our guerrillas will there be new replacements.</p>
<p>Each station has three or four cannons and blockhouses, and Japanese guard soldiers are stationed there regularly, ranging from four or five hundred at large stations to two or three hundred at small stations. Next to each railway bridge, there are two cannons and a fort, and several Japanese soldiers are usually stationed there.</p>
<p>Even so, it still cannot prevent our guerrillas from regularly removing rails and planting landmines because as soon as night falls, they lie in ambush in the bunkers like corpses, and even if they discover someone destroying the rails, they dare not come out easily. From Xingtai to Tianjin, on average, a train derails at least three or four times every few dozen days.</p>
<p>Chinese people are not allowed to carry more than one hundred yuan of legal tender when going out. If you want to carry more, you can only exchange the legal tender for counterfeit currency issued by the United Reserve Bank. Otherwise, you will be suspected of being a "bandit" and will be arrested. Once, a merchant in Shijiazhuang risked carrying one thousand three hundred yuan of legal tender, but unfortunately, he was searched by a traitor. So the traitor said to him: "You are too daring, daring to disobey orders and carry so much legal tender. You are lucky to have met me. If the Japanese had seen it, what would have happened?" As a result, the merchant was lucky to escape with his life, but the one thousand three hundred yuan of legal tender was unceremoniously taken by the traitor.</p>
<p>The houses along the railway line have been demolished or burned by the Japanese army, supposedly to prevent guerrillas. However, this cruel behavior of the × people not only failed to stop our guerrillas' activities in the slightest; on the contrary, often overnight, the sides of the railway are covered with sawn-off telegraph poles. Recently, in order to prevent sabotage by our guerrillas, the × people often use iron wires to wrap the telegraph poles tightly one zhang or more above the ground, but this does not have much effect because our guerrillas will use ladders.</p>
<p>The common people near the railway sometimes experience great difficulties. The × people often guard the villages at night, so they dare not come out, so at night, the villages are almost completely dominated by our guerrillas. At this time, the common people help our guerrillas to work, destroying roads, sawing telegraph poles... At dawn, the guerrillas leave, and the common people immediately report to the × army, and then the × army orders the local common people to repair the roads or telegraph poles that they themselves destroyed at night... (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Regarding the situation in Tianjin, the British and French governments are maintaining the closest contact and conducting careful research. As for what decisions the British and French have made, officials are keeping silent. However, according to "Le Figaro," the British and French have decided to act jointly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] According to foreign news, after actively exchanging views recently, the authorities of Britain and France have decided to cooperate in all aspects. Therefore, the British military authorities in the Far East have recently invited Lieutenant General Dou Co, commander of the French fleet in the Far East, and the commander of the French army in Vietnam, and De Foz, chief of staff of the Southeast Air Force, to visit Singapore Port at the end of this month to inspect defense affairs, and to hold talks with representatives of the British Navy, Army, and Air Force, so as to achieve a unified joint action method for the navies, armies, and air forces of the two countries in the Far East. This is the same meaning as General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of France, recently going to London to discuss the issue of joint defense in Europe with the British military authorities. According to reports, representatives of the British headquarters and the two autonomous territories of Australia and New Zealand held an important meeting in New Zealand in April to discuss two cases: (1) the implementation of joint defense in wartime by British territories; (2) how to achieve self-sufficiency economically. The results of the meeting have been notified to France, and the French government has also taken the same measures to ensure the safety of the south. The Singapore meeting is actually a supplement to the New Zealand meeting. It is true that Japan still has the possibility of joining the Anti-Communist International Pact, and the actions of Britain and France must be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 12th] At the afternoon meeting of the British House of Commons on the 12th, Conservative Party member Hana asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, "The Japanese government recently announced that if its troops stationed in Shanghai believe that their safety is threatened, they intend not to respect the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by the public concession. Regarding this, has our government exchanged views with the governments of the United States and France?" Foreign Secretary Butler immediately responded on behalf of the Prime Minister, saying that for all issues jointly related to the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, our ambassador to Japan, Craigie, maintains close contact with the ambassadors of France and the United States.</p>
<p>Negotiations Between Tianjin and Tokyo</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, a reporter for financial news and foreign affairs recently stated that the United States and Britain have been in contact on this matter. The US government has agreed to have its Consul General in Tianjin serve as the chairman of the joint British-Japanese committee. In addition, there will be one committee member each from Britain and Japan, for a total of three members including the US representative. The method for this organizing committee to resolve difficulties is being sought from the Japanese government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, people close to the government here recently stated that the authorities are currently considering forming a joint British-Japanese committee to resolve the current disputes, with each side of Britain and Japan recommending two committee members, and the US Consul General being invited to serve as the chairman. The US Consul has also agreed to this. Although the Japanese side opposes the appointment of an American as chairman, the Consul General is impartial and respected even by the Japanese.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 14th] British Ambassador to Japan Craigie visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this afternoon to discuss the situation in Tianjin. Today, Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki also met for several hours. Afterward, Domei News Agency announced that the three had decided to adopt a tough policy towards the concessions in China (including the Tianjin concessions) because the concessions have become the base for supporting the "Chiang regime."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 14th] At yesterday's cabinet meeting, the situation in Tianjin was discussed. Foreign Minister Arita reported on "Japan's determination to deal with the Tianjin situation." "Yomiuri Shimbun" commented on the British side's compromise proposal, saying, "The purpose of Japan's actions this time is not limited to the corner of the British concession in Tianjin. Japan's purpose is to deal with all foreign concessions in China and the entire Far East policy of Britain and France."</p>
<p>The US State Department Pays Extreme Attention</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Hull and all officials of the State Department are currently paying secret and close attention to the Japanese preparations to blockade the British and French concessions in Tianjin. It is learned here that the Japanese blockade note has been delivered to the US Consulate General, and the note contains a statement that US commercial interests will be affected.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 14th] Although the US government has not yet decided what steps to take to deal with Japan's blockade of the Tianjin concessions, the State Department is paying extreme attention to this matter. The US government must wait for Britain and France to take action before agreeing. There are 400 US manufacturers in Tianjin, all with branch offices. There are a total of 1,200 shops under the management of the US Consul General in Tianjin, including two banks, with investments exceeding 12 million Chinese paper currency. The annual business is about 200 million. If the Japanese implement a blockade, US merchants will suffer great losses.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] Regarding the serious current situation in Tianjin, today's "Shanghai Evening Post," a major American newspaper here, proposed that the best solution is to request a ruling from the US court in China, based on the principle of justice. This matter can definitely be resolved. It also said that the United States sympathizes with the methods proposed by Britain, but the Japanese must believe that the United States will be able to handle the matter fairly. It also said that the responsible persons on the Japanese side also have the same view. Finally, the newspaper stated that although the United States is not the target of Japan's exclusion of foreigners in China, it must also protect Britain's reasonable steps.</p>
<p>The British Side Releases the Course of Negotiations</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Foreign Secretary Butler gave a report in the House of Commons today on the Tianjin issue, saying, "On April 9, the manager of the Tianjin pseudo-United Reserve Bank and the newly appointed Customs Superintendent was assassinated in the British concession. This is the first time that riots have occurred in the British concession since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The murderer was a Chinese who is still at large. The Public Works Bureau invited the Japanese side to cooperate and conducted many searches in the concession. As a result, several suspects were detained. The Japanese authorities insisted that four of the detained were terrorists and were related to the above-mentioned murder case and the killing of three Japanese soldiers. The Public Works Bureau handed over the four accused to the Japanese side for questioning. The four confessed, almost admitting their guilt, but after being sent back to the Public Works Bureau's patrol room, they immediately recanted their confessions. The British concession then issued a warning on June 7 that anyone who disrupts the neutrality of the concession will be handed over to the relevant authorities for interrogation or expelled from the concession. However, the four were arrested before the warning was issued, and there is currently no evidence to prove that they are related to the murder case. The confessions they made under Japanese interrogation also claimed that they were forced to confess under severe torture by the Japanese side. Therefore, the British government believes that there is absolutely no reason to hand over the criminals to the local Japanese puppet court for trial. This attitude is absolutely consistent with the habits of the past twenty-two months. The British Consul General then notified the Japanese Consul General on June 7, stating that he would keep the criminals in custody pending the Japanese side providing evidence. If the Japanese side does not provide evidence, the British authorities will only expel the four from the British concession. Two other people who were found to be privately hiding bombs can be handed over to the Japanese side for handling, and those who violate the law in the future can fulfill the covenant of the above-mentioned warning. However, the Japanese authorities said that they were not satisfied with the reply and have taken certain measures to force all Japanese shops and puppet organization Chinese employees in the British concession to leave the British concession, and to isolate the British concession. The situation is now very serious, but both sides are continuing negotiations, hoping to reach a resolution." Labour Party member Burke asked whether the British government would explain to Japan that the Japanese side's continuous opposition to the public concession would inevitably lead to serious consequences if this behavior continued. Butler replied that he believed the Japanese authorities were aware of the British attitude, and the report had already indicated this. Conservative Party member Milner asked whether the past practice was to send such criminals to a court in the British concession for public trial, or whether a special court could be set up in the future to try such criminals so that evidence could be presented fairly. Butler replied that the situation in this case was particularly different, and the authorities would definitely consider all possible measures. Labour Party member Beringer then stated that he and all members of the House of Commons hoped that the Foreign Secretary could state that the British government would absolutely not allow the Japanese to carry out their threats, that is, to blockade the British concession in Tianjin. Butler replied that he hoped Beringer would pay attention to the last sentence of his report, that is, the situation is extremely serious, but negotiations are still underway.</p>
<p>Tianjin × Started Implementing Blockade Yesterday</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Tianjin Foreign News, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin issued a notice yesterday, stating that starting from 6:00 am today, pedestrians and vehicles between the British and French concessions, the Japanese concession, and the Chinese territory should be prohibited from passing through. The Japanese army stipulated that pedestrians and vehicles should be inspected at seven locations. Ships in the Haihe River must also wait for inspection near the Dalian Mail Ship Company or the Nihonbashi in Special District 2. Those who violate the notice will be dealt with in accordance with the regulations of the Japanese Army Headquarters. The Japanese side has recently released detailed information. A spokesman for the Japanese military authorities said yesterday that the Japanese side's "isolation" of the British and French concessions is a due responsibility for the Japanese surrendered army in the current situation. The reason why the Japanese side has taken this measure is because the British authorities refused to hand over the four assassination suspects to the Japanese side. However, in reality, it is more than that. The notice issued by the Japanese side is an expression of the anger of the Japanese government and the Japanese people caused by the British's "pro-China" policy. Now that the arrow is on the string, the current problem is not only solved by the British side handing over the suspects to the Japanese side. Unless the British concession authorities cooperate with Japan to jointly build a "new order in East Asia" and abandon their "pro-China policy," the Japanese side will never stop its restrictive measures. The so-called "pro-China" policy is to protect anti-Japanese elements and communist elements, support Chinese legal tender, hinder the circulation of United Reserve Bank notes, monopolize materials, tacitly allow illegal elements to set up and use radio stations, and allow schools to teach anti-Japanese books, etc. The spokesperson continued that residents of China, Germany, and the United States in the British and French concessions will feel inconvenience after the "isolation" of the British and French concessions. This is very regrettable, but residents of all countries can move away from the concessions. The British and French concessions are the source of disputes and the source of undermining the "construction of a new order in East Asia" and undermining the "restoration of public security in North China." The Japanese army's "isolation" of the concessions is the only solution in the current situation. Currently, at the border of the British concession, in addition to British military trucks still patrolling as in the past few days, other measures have been taken, but it is difficult to determine what their nature is. The authorities have investigated the supply of food. The amount of flour stored is still sufficient, but British merchants are worried about the impact of the new restrictions, because their business is already in a difficult situation. Residents in the concessions show no signs of panic, and they express their determination to be angry. However, all parties acknowledge that the current situation is extremely serious. According to news from the Japanese side, there are no British or Japanese shops in the British and French concessions. They have all been evacuated. The Yokohama Specie Bank branch and the "United Reserve Bank" branch both moved out on the 11th. News from the Japanese side also said that foreigners in the concessions are showing signs of uneasiness. 350,000 Chinese residents and foreigners will be trapped in the concessions, and prices have risen by 20%.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 14th] This morning, a reporter from this agency inspected the surroundings of the British concession in Tianjin and saw that the Japanese method of blockading the concession was quite effective. All roads leading to the British concession have been blocked. Two roads are open (one in and one out). People waiting to enter and exit at each intersection are lined up in long lines. Except for residents of Germany and Italy, all people entering and exiting are subject to strict searches and questions. Their documents are also reviewed. Chinese people must take off their clothes for inspection in the guard room. Food prices have soared, with some as high as 70%.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 14th] At 5:00 am this morning, the Japanese army began to implement the blockade of the British concession. The barbed wire and other materials used for the blockade had been prepared several days ago and were built today. It is said that the Japanese military authorities notified the British concession late last night that they were impressed by the spirit of its compromise solution, but it was too late. The Japanese side had already prepared to implement all blockade measures, so it could not suddenly change its original plan in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beiping, 14th] British and other foreign women and children in Tianjin, unwilling to be trapped in the city during the hot summer, flocked to Beidaihe, Shanhaiguan, and Beiping yesterday. Japanese newspapers stated that except for those leaving the concession on official business, who would not be inspected, all others would be strictly inspected when entering and exiting. An army spokesperson in Beiping said that food would still be allowed to be transported into the concession freely.</p>
<p>British Public Opinion Strongly Advocates a Hard Line</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] "The Daily Telegraph" wrote today, "Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has repeatedly taken anti-British actions. Now, the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin is another addition to a large number of anti-British incidents." The report mentioned the Tinker incident and the detention of Speel, saying, "The search of the Rampura wheel gives the impression that the occurrence of new anti-British actions is encouraged and planned. It is very clear that Western countries do not want to be involved in the war in the Far East, but Japan has invaded the limit that the British government can tolerate. The repeated occurrence of British-Japanese incidents clearly has a fixed purpose. It is obvious that Japan's invasion of China has been slow to progress. This is also commonly seen by the Chinese and Japanese people, so they want to rebuild the Japanese side's 'face' with the loss of a third country. Some recent anti-British incidents are miserable and unpleasant, but this is a sign of Japan's weakness, not its strength. It is important that the British government and local representatives should not accept the Japanese side's illegal actions without protest or removing the protection that the defensive army can implement."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] "The Daily Mail" said today, "The situation in Tianjin has gradually foreshadowed that the Japanese authorities not only blockade the concessions, but also a spokesperson hinted at expanding the incident about the extradition of four Chinese. If the Japanese people's purpose is not to try these people, but to destroy the position of the concessions, then this challenge action is related to Britain's entire position in the Far East."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] All newspapers published the news of the blockade of the Tianjin concessions in a prominent position, with maps and detailed discussions of the Japanese attack on British interests in North China. The Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have rejected the British proposal to form a joint committee. Reuters has learned that the Japanese government replied to the British note, saying that the Tianjin incident is a "local incident" and must be resolved locally. The British government is currently closely considering progressive steps. Officials here are keeping silent about what retaliatory steps will be taken. Public opinion generally believes that the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concessions is an intolerable action. The British government will never yield. The British and French governments are currently discussing and believe that the French are prepared to take any necessary steps to assist Britain. The US government has authorized the US Consul General in Tianjin to serve as the chairman of the joint committee proposed by Britain and to make every effort to mediate and obtain a resolution.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] MP Moore today raised the issue of the blockade of the Tianjin concessions in the House of Commons, questioning whether the government could immediately notify the Japanese government to stop this action, otherwise, it would immediately refuse the Japanese to use Hong Kong, Singapore, and Penang as transportation ports. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that the government is currently considering appropriate steps to deal with the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concessions. Mr. Mantel questioned whether the government maintains close contact with the French and American governments. Butler replied that the British government is in close contact with the French and American governments, and Mr. Mantel can rest assured.</p>
<p>Short Review</p>
<h3 id="e6">Treating Prisoners of War Well <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, various newspapers published the "Instructions on Treating Prisoners of War Well" issued by our country's military authorities, allowing people all over the world to see a strong contrast:</p>
<p>On the one hand, it represents the reactionary, regressive, and even heaven-defying forces, which are the Japanese invaders. In their war of aggression against China, they not only rampage and plunder ×× slaughter, but also use poison gas and bombing to ravage undefended cities, kill innocent civilians, women, and children, and destroy sanitation and cultural institutions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it represents the revolutionary, and it can even be said that it is the heaven-ordained force, which is our China in the War of Resistance. Our resistance is not only a "holy resistance that the sage has no choice but to use," but also, when bombing the three islands last year, promoted the sacred and great national spirit that I would not × with the Japanese people, and treated prisoners of war with benevolence and generosity as the main principle.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Those who gain the Way prosper, and those who lose the Way perish." Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" also puts gaining the Way first. Our War of Resistance this time has not only gained the support of the entire nation at home but also the sympathy of the world abroad. Even the Japanese people under the control of the invaders will not be able to suppress the same feelings of excitement. The opportunity for victory or defeat has long been as clear as a torch!</p>
<h3 id="e7">Honoring the Teacher's Way <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>According to Guilin Aviation News in yesterday's evening paper, the Guangxi Provincial Government issued a circular to all primary and secondary school students in the province, instructing them to respectfully address teachers as "Laoshi" (teacher). From now on, all instances of the word "Jiaoyuan" (educator) should be changed to "Jiaoshi" (teacher).</p>
<p>This is a manifestation of honoring the teacher's way. Originally, honoring the teacher's way was a virtue passed down for thousands of years in our country. Even since the revolution, our great leader Sun Yat-sen has repeatedly praised it, and our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly elaborated on its great relationship in his recent address to the National Education Conference.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone hopes that, as the Guangxi Provincial Government's telegram said: "When the name is correct, the leader will naturally not underestimate himself, and the disciples will also follow the rules and regulations, and be respectful and courteous, without daring to overstep!" 'Ah, how glorious!' But when asked whether those who are currently teachers, know whether they "can repay the appearance"!</p>
<p>We hope that all children in the world will respect teachers, but we also hope that all gentlemen in the country who are teachers will not be complacent about being respected. You must be worthy and without shame. First of all, you must constantly promote the era in the trend of the times at any time and lead the masses in the student groups. Do not make students be able to follow the rules and regulations, especially to enable students to be vigorous and promising day by day, and to shoulder the important responsibilities of the country in the future!</p>

<h3 id="e13">Wang Jingwei's Surrender to the Enemy Creates Just Another Puppet; Japanese Political Circles Also Do Not Take Him Seriously; Shanghai's "Continental Times" Publishes Commentary <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Shanghai's "Continental Times" recently published an editorial stating that the National Government's order last week to arrest Wang Jingwei was not surprising. When Wang left Chongqing, the National Government still adopted a lenient attitude, hoping that he would come to his senses. However, Wang willingly served the enemy and cut himself off from the people, so the National Government had no choice but to follow public opinion and issue an arrest warrant. Wang is now reaping what he sowed. According to Chongqing sources, Wang recently went to Tokyo for secret negotiations with the Japanese, with the clear aim of seeking a puppet position. Even if Wang achieves this goal, it is doubtful whether he can coordinate and get along with other puppets. Jiang's political power in the country has long been eliminated. His return to China with Japanese support will make it even more difficult for him to rally the people. Even figures in Japanese political circles doubt Wang's capabilities, believing that Wang's eventual rise to power will merely be the addition of another puppet created by Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] The Mexico City branch, the Mexico First Direct Branch, the Mexico Second Direct Branch, the San Pedro branch, the Panuco branch, and the Mexico City Anti-Japanese Association all telegraphed President Chiang and Chairman Lin, requesting that Wang Jingwei be labeled as a traitor and that an arrest warrant be issued for his severe punishment.</p>

<p>— Firefly</p>
<p>Gathering at Yihe Market</p>
<p>The weather in April was sultry. The rain fell like strings of beads, and the road was muddy. Every step required careful attention to one's footing. Enemy planes, silver with red dots, circled over our heads once, twice, heading towards Boluo City and Huizhou City behind us. This kind of flying and reconnaissance, experience told me, meant the front line was somewhat tense. But we were heading to the tense front line.</p>
<p>The shattered Boluo City had already disappeared behind us, and the green hills and misty rain had blocked our view. "Sir, how about taking a break at Yihe Market?" the honest porter carrying comfort goods asked us. "Of course, we're meeting at Yihe Market," I replied.</p>
<p>The dilapidated shops and stunted trees were before our eyes. The dilapidated shops, in the midst of the fierce wind and rain, seemed particularly pitiful and small.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Yihe, the more than ten representatives of the Boluo community's comfort delegation to the front-line soldiers and civilians had gathered. Everyone looked like a drowned rat, but everyone felt victorious in their hearts—this could be said to be a tactical success, dividing dozens of people into several small teams to advance, avoiding enemy reconnaissance targets—using the opportunity to avoid the rain to rest was undoubtedly worthwhile. It was a pity this small market was so pathetic. Besides blind man's cakes, peanuts, and cigarettes, it was impossible to find a cup of tea. Judging from this townscape, one could have felt comfortable and had some tea. The shopkeeper standing at the entrance of the market clearly had a brand new sign of a teahouse, so why was there not a single person in sight? If it was not bombed, why were all the shops still so deserted? I raised these questions. The experienced Secretary Zhu replied: "Indeed, this place used to be prosperous. The lime wall over there is where the warehouse with 100,000 capital was located ten years ago, before Yang Ximin's rebellion, it was looted by bandits and all the shops left. The market inside had a special period of prosperity. Every day, it was filled with foreign goods, ingots, and gambling, and people flocked to it. After the government implemented a ban on gambling, some people who made a living from gambling regarded this place as their forbidden fruit. After the Japanese entered, the liveliness was beyond words. After the recovery, the gamblers had to leave, and after this group of people left, the market was bound to be deserted."</p>
<p>We rested for more than an hour. At one o'clock in the afternoon, we left Yihe and headed towards Longhua. The rain continued to fall. On the way, Comrade Chen Yuanrui from the War Workers' Group supplemented some of the special circumstances of Yihe Market, because he had come to work here a month after the recovery of Boluo and had encountered several bandits robbing people, and every day there were bandits robbing in the vicinity. Only now was it no longer happening.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only impression Yihe gave me was: "Bandits, gambling, bandits." (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] British Foreign Office expert William Strang arrived here this morning from Warsaw. The Director of the Third Western Department of the Soviet Foreign Office, Tytarenko, the Deputy Director, and secretaries from the British Embassy greeted him at the station. However, no senior Soviet officials were present at the station because Strang did not have the rank of cabinet member. After consulting with the British Ambassador here, Strang immediately went to the Soviet Foreign Office to meet with Molotov. He will reside at the British Embassy and there will be no social events. The Anglo-Soviet negotiations are still in progress. The Soviet press does not mention Strang's trip, which is customary in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] As British envoy William Strang was about to arrive in Moscow, the Soviet government newspaper "Pravda" commented on the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations, insisting that Latvia, Estonia, and Finland must accept Soviet guarantees. The newspaper argued that the neutrality of the Baltic states was absolutely essential for the security of the Soviet Union and that these countries needed guarantees from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union because they could not resist aggression. The newspaper also criticized the governments of the Baltic states, implying that the opposition of the foreign ministers of Estonia and Finland to Soviet guarantees was due to German influence. It stated, "In this situation, we are faced with a misunderstanding or hidden ill will, hoping to break the defense line of peaceful countries against aggression."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 14th] Former British First Lord of the Admiralty, Cooper, recently published an article in the "Evening Standard" here, strongly advocating that the government should immediately guarantee the independence of the Baltic states and quickly conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. He stated that the Baltic states were to the Soviet Union as Belgium was to Britain. Even if the Belgian government adopted an unrealistic policy and declared that it no longer needed British and French guarantees, this would not change Britain's attitude. Britain would still go to war to prevent Belgium from falling into foreign hands, whether Belgium accepted the guarantee or not. The Soviet Union regarded the integrity of the Baltic states as extremely important to its security, and this attitude could not be condemned. If Britain wanted to obtain Soviet assistance in times of crisis, it should also provide assistance to the Soviet Union. If the British government did not quickly conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union, it would ultimately fail.</p>

Secretary of Commerce Stanley replied that import figures for Japanese goods in 1938 had not yet been released. As for 1937, the import volume was much smaller than in 1936.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Concessions and War <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>"Japan's true enemy is not in China, but in the concessions within China." This is the opinion of the Japanese newspaper "Miyako Shimbun," as reported by Reuters from Tokyo on the 6th of this month. Such words are almost universally recognized by intuition as expressions of emotion. Since they arise from emotion, whether they are grounded in reason can be set aside. However, in all times and places, the historical traces of mankind are more often driven by emotion than governed by reason. Therefore, for those who value reason, it is important to skillfully manage one's own emotions and not to ignore the emotions of others. Moreover, observing Japan's actions towards us, most are based on emotion; at least, the initiation of the conflict at the Marco Polo Bridge and the sudden dispatch of heavy troops into Shanhaiguan, as well as the initiation of the conflict at the Hongqiao Airport and the sudden dispatch of naval forces to threaten Wusongkou, have made the Sino-Japanese problem unresolvable and led to war, which today marks the beginning of its twenty-fourth month. Is this a rational act? It is driven by emotion! In this vein, how dare we despise the "Miyako Shimbun"!</p>
<p>Regarding concessions in China, it is not difficult to explain their origin from a historical perspective, their boundaries from a geographical perspective, their nature from a legal perspective, and their system from a governance perspective. However, in terms of their relationship, their influence, and the analysis of their good and bad, fortune and misfortune, benefits and losses, it is extremely complex and subtle. Not only do various contradictions coexist, but they also evolve and transform in multiple contradictory directions. It is not easy to create a concise outline or an accurate concept. Therefore, throughout history, Chinese and foreigners have held diverse views on concessions: some longing for them, some despising them; some cherishing them, some discarding them; some believing in their unlimited future, some doubting their imminent destruction; some viewing them as paradise, the source of all blessings; some viewing them as hell, the source of all evils. This is because their multifaceted nature leads to vastly different assessments. This is true in peacetime, and when the Sino-Japanese war broke out, the contradictions inherent in the nature of concessions became even more exposed. After launching a military invasion against us, Japan encountered unexpected troubles in military, economic, and diplomatic aspects. Let alone finding a way to resolve these troubles, it is impossible to answer the previous causes of these troubles. Instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed heaven and others, and then shifted their anger to the concessions, as if they had found something and said, "The enemy is here!"</p>
<p>How can concessions be Japan's enemy? The materials for our country's war of resistance are based on the vast inland, including fields, hills, forests, and mines. Concessions are like bullets; how can they be significant? The spirit of our country's war of resistance lies in endurance, hardship, perseverance, and the reproduction of the military and civilians in the interior. The quality and quantity of those living in the concessions are only a hundredth of that of inland. The import of our country's war of resistance weapons comes from Guangdong and the only northwest and southwest remains as channels, so is there a reliance on concessions for imports and exports? Our country's victory in the war of resistance lies in a long period of time and a vast space. The factors for the victory or defeat of both sides are not at all related to the concessions. To put it bluntly, if today's concessions are controlled by us, what benefit is there to the war of resistance? If the concessions are controlled by Japan, what harm is there to the future of China's war of resistance, and what benefit is there to Japan's operations? Moreover, concessions and war are not only unrelated, but also closely related. What is the relationship? If Japan wins, Japan will surely regard the concessions as its forbidden fruit. If China wins, the concessions will surely prosper unprecedentedly with the rise of China's great cause of recovery. Therefore, to say that the fate of war is tied to the concessions is completely unreasonable. The fate of the concessions is in fact transferred according to the final outcome of the war. This is because the concessions are in our country, and the natural destined can also be. This kind of close relationship, this kind of inevitable cause and effect, is well known throughout the world. If one is driven by emotion and attempts to change the fate of the concessions before the war decides victory or defeat, it is like pulling up seedlings to help them grow, tantamount to suicide. Why? Preserving the concessions depends on the cooperation of all parties, while destroying the concessions can be done by any one party. Therefore, we not only advise Chinese people within the concessions to respect themselves, but also want to warn the Japanese not to mistake the concessions as enemies!</p>
<p>Emotional words are not relevant to reason and are not beneficial to reality. However, if one stirs up emotions and leads many people to emotion, even forming emotional actions, it is not only irrelevant and useless, but also leads to a wrong path and brings disaster upon oneself. Therefore, if China cannot understand that the concessions are irrelevant to the war situation and cannot respect themselves within the concessions, leading to the destruction of the concessions, then international sympathy for China will have an unfavorable change. If Japan regards the concessions as enemies, then the concessions are inherently international bombs. If Japan detonates them, we will see the Pacific Ocean boil!</p>
<h3 id="e21">British Attitude Towards Japan Gradually Strengthens; Authoritative Figures Demand Positive Action; Britain May Retaliate Against Japan <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] Influential circles in Britain are now exerting pressure on the government to take positive measures to protect British rights in China. The suggestion made by Lord Ailwyn on the first of this week, advocating that Japanese ships not be allowed to load and unload goods in Singapore, Penang, and other places, will still be raised by someone in the House of Commons in the coming days. Today, a powerful delegation will meet with Undersecretary Butler to present the following demands: (1) Implement a consular visa system for goods shipped from China to Britain; (2) Strengthen British defenses in Shanghai; (3) Take all other necessary measures to protect British rights and interests in China. According to well-informed sources, in recent months, Britain's attitude towards Japan has greatly strengthened. Even newspapers that have always been lenient towards Japan have changed their attitude. Each time the House of Commons meets, government officials report that they have made representations to Tokyo, and the various chambers of parliament sneer at this. Other parties believe that the Japanese military is exerting pressure on Britain, which will inevitably become more serious, and will inevitably lead Britain to openly express its intention to retaliate against Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e22">House of Commons Discusses Chinese Legal Tender; Credit Remains Unshaken <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Member of Parliament Bellinger asked in the House of Commons today the reasons for the devaluation of Chinese legal tender and the temporary suspension of the use of the Currency Equalization Fund. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Simon, replied that he had quoted the communique issued in Hong Kong on June 8 and said, "As generally known, in the past few weeks, the Chinese Currency Equalization Fund has not been under pressure, and the credit of Chinese legal tender has not been shaken in the slightest. The purpose of announcing a temporary suspension on Wednesday was to allow Chinese legal tender to seek a more suitable economic level on its own, so that import and export transactions can reach a balance." Simon further cited a similar fact in June of last year as an example, saying that after the level of eight pence was found, it was able to be maintained until December. He firmly believed that the new level had now been obtained and would be firmly maintained. Some goods that China previously imported from abroad are now manufactured domestically. According to reports from various places, a bumper harvest is expected this year, which will also contribute to reducing the import of foreign goods. The foreign exchange needed by the Chinese government to purchase military supplies and other supplies has been arranged and does not need to go through the exchange market. The strength of the Equalization Fund has been strengthened, and efforts to further expand the fund's base have also been successful. Therefore, the authorities have absolute confidence in their ability to maintain foreign exchange prices, and there is no problem. Although the foreign exchange price of Chinese legal tender has changed repeatedly, it is still greatly supported and trusted by the people, because it can still be exchanged for foreign currency at any time. Bellinger also asked about the use of the Chinese Currency Equalization Fund. Since it was used to stabilize Chinese currency, but the foreign exchange price of China has fallen, has this fund been ineffective? The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this fund still has its effectiveness and again pointed out the communique issued in Hong Kong on June 8. Bell also asked whether the fund proposed by Britain had been affected, so the fund had stopped operating. Simon again asked him to refer to the June 8 communique, saying that the most complete information was nothing more than this.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The US government's Neutrality Act, which stipulates the cancellation of the clause prohibiting the export of arms to belligerent countries, has now been unanimously approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. According to a member of the committee, when the bill was discussed, representatives from the US State Department informed the members of the committee that the large amount of arms Germany had obtained in Czechoslovakia and the fact that Bohemia and Moravia were under German protection had given Hitler an advantage over Britain and France. If the United States still prohibited the sale of arms to belligerent countries in the event of a war in Europe, it would be tantamount to helping Germany.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Rome, 13th] According to Burgos, General Franco is scheduled to visit Italy at the end of September.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Madrid, 12th] After arriving in Rome, the Spanish military delegation discussed the issue of Spain joining the German-Italian military pact. However, it is generally known that most important figures in the Spanish government oppose this proposal. Today, the official news agency issued a statement saying that the national military delegation held a meeting with Italian military leaders this morning. Interior Minister Suner and Foreign Minister Ciano were also present. This statement has not yet been published by the newspapers. It is said that the proposal for Spain to join the German-Italian military pact is strongly opposed by all sectors of society, which can be seen from this.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Paris, 14th] Since learning of General Franco's planned visit to Italy in September, newspapers here have been discussing the possibility of Spain joining the German-Italian Axis. The issue was also mentioned during the visit of the former Spanish Interior Minister to Rome and Foreign Minister Ciano's preparations to go to Madrid. However, newspapers today have criticized and expressed their belief that Spain will soon form an agreement with the Axis powers. This kind of viewpoint is expressed for the first time. The Rome correspondent of "Le Figaro" stated that a new Spain will inevitably return to the German-Italian Axis sooner or later. The Rome correspondent of "Le Journal" stated that Foreign Minister Ciano of Italy will visit Spain in July, and his real purpose may be to sign an agreement with Spain.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 13th] The British representative today reported to the League of Nations Mandates Commission on the events that occurred in Palestine last year. He said that the terrorist organization there was disbanded at the end of April, and since May, efforts have been made to restrict the entry of illegal Jews. The Jews strongly oppose the British government's White Paper. As for the attitude of the Arabs, it is not yet fully understood. Some members of the Mandates Commission asked questions about the nature of the disturbances and where the rioters obtained their weapons. The British representative replied that most of the weapons used by the rioters were manufactured and hidden in Palestine during the World War. Regarding Dallas Jordon, the British representative said that although the people there support the terrorist incidents in Palestine, they are still calm. In addition, British Colonial Secretary MacDonald will deliver a speech to the Mandates Commission on the 15th of this month.</p>

It is expected that he will reside here for a long period of time, because according to the opinions of Polish political circles, there is no need for Ambassador Du to remain in Rome in the current situation. Recently, the Polish press's attitude towards Italy has been extremely hostile. An Italian newspaper published an article pointing out Germany's reasonable demands for the "Polish Corridor" and warning Poland not to provoke Germany. Polish newspapers were particularly angry about this, saying that Italy's anti-Polish rhetoric could not be worse than this. Poland originally expressed sympathy for Italy, but this type of writing is actually forcing Poland to decide to change its attitude.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Ten Commandments for Courtship <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Believe it or not</p>
<p>First Commandment: Don't fall in love with the first boyfriend or girlfriend. It's best to make several friends of the opposite sex, compare them, and choose the best one.</p>
<p>Second Commandment: Don't pursue a member of the opposite sex who constantly stimulates your nerves, causes frequent quarrels, or turns you into someone who likes to quarrel. If a man and a woman are not very harmonious during courtship, then after marriage, there is certainly no possibility of growing old together. It's true that it's a lot of fun when lovers reconcile after a quarrel. But after marriage, it's not easy to repair a broken mirror when disagreements arise!</p>
<p>Third Commandment: Don't fall in love with someone of the opposite sex who is too jealous. Don't be too jealous yourself. During courtship, you should have the right to make male and female friends. At the same time, you should also allow the other party to have the same right to make male and female friends. If young men and women are often jealous during courtship, then after marriage, the family will become a prison for one or both parties.</p>
<p>Fourth Commandment: Don't expect marriage to change the personality of your lover. If young men and women like to drink, gamble, or do other bad things before marriage, and promise to improve after marriage, even if they swear to heaven, they will never keep their promise after marriage. Let them use the behavior of turning over a new leaf to prove their intention to change before getting married. Don't expect the wedding to change the other person's bad habits.</p>
<p>Fifth Commandment: Don't make the foolish move of getting engaged in a fit of pique. Many women have disagreements with their fiancés and, in order to make their fiancés feel heartbroken, get engaged to men they don't like, just for revenge. Many men also make this mistake, just to let their girlfriends know that there is more than one woman in the world. Remember, a marriage of spite never succeeds.</p>
<p>Sixth Commandment: Don't get married too quickly. On the other hand, don't delay the engagement indefinitely for several years. Because in both of these situations, there are many hidden dangers.</p>
<p>Seventh Commandment: Don't tell your future spouse about your past mistakes, and don't ask your future spouse to confess his or her past mistakes, because neither of you is marrying the past. If you are both physically and mentally ready to get married, then the past should always be buried underground and not dug up.</p>
<p>Eighth Commandment: Don't expect courtship by correspondence to have a happy ending. Before the wedding, both parties must have direct and concrete knowledge of each other.</p>
<p>Ninth Commandment: Don't marry someone whose background is too different from yours. Interracial marriages rarely have happy endings.</p>
<p>Tenth Commandment: Don't commercialize marriage. If you commercialize marriage, you will find that you are losing a lot in this transaction.</p>

<p>Once, he was performing again. Speaking of the defeat in 1918, he said, "That should be entirely the responsibility of the Jews." One standing in the front row, who was clearly Jewish, was also nodding his head in agreement.</p>
<p>"You see," old Hitler laughed and shouted, "Even the Jews are sympathetic to what I say." Then he said to that person, "Tell us, in what aspect should you Jews be responsible for our failure?"</p>
<p>"It's very simple!" the Jew replied, "Because there were too many Jewish officers."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, there are no Jewish officers in the German army," old Hitler corrected.</p>
<p>"Yes, I mean, in 1918, there were too many Jewish officers in the French and American armies!"</p>

<p>In 1914, when the European situation was tense, the German-American route's "Kronprinzessin Cecilie" carried six million gold bars to Germany. Chuckes Shipping Company's radio operator Jack and mechanic Bill also took the ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator Roumon Garros. At the same time, Jack also became friends with the German radio operator on the ship, Bauer. Jack was working for Bauer when news arrived...</p>

<p>— by Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>"In the current situation, we can. Britain has declared war on Germany and Austria. You should stop, or it will be detrimental to you."</p>
<p>A burst of footsteps startled him, and he quickly turned around. Roumon Garros came in.</p>
<p>"Are you in charge of the radio? I guess that friend who is always hungry must have gone to eat again. Ah, is there any news? When I came in, I saw you working on the machine."</p>
<p>"I haven't received any news since I came in," Jack said nonchalantly, "I was wondering who could be joking with me using the radio."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, someone sent a message saying they were the British cruiser HMS Iron Duke, saying that Britain had declared war on Germany, and—"</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, Garros stretched out both hands and pressed them on his shoulders. "This is not a joke, it's the truth."</p>
<p>"This is the truth? How do you know?" Jack asked strangely.</p>
<p>"For months, the diplomatic world has been filled with this atmosphere. I thought war would have been declared long ago. That's why I went to the United States to buy airplanes."</p>
<p>"What, is France involved too?"</p>
<p>"That's right, Russia too. Two days after Russia declares war, it will be France's turn. These are the so-called Triple Entente, and two have already moved. Now, it is expected that Britain will also come to help resist that tyrannical Germany."</p>
<p>"But how do you know so much? When we left New York, the newspapers didn't say anything about it! There was just a small conflict between Austria and Serbia."</p>
<p>"That's what caused this, or in other words, that's the fuse. But, if you ask me how I know about Russia and France declaring war, I'm not the only one on this ship who knows about this. Captain Lock and some of the crew know about it too, and they got the news from the radio, just like me. They have been paying attention to British cruisers for a long time, because they are afraid that Britain will join the Franco-Russian alliance. This German ship has six million gold bars, which is a valuable prize for Britain. My friend, there is a show to watch."</p>
<p>"That's amazing. In that case, the message just now wasn't a joke, and this British cruiser might capture us and take away these treasures."</p>
<p>"If she can catch us—that's it. She will imprison many Germans on the ship and take this ship to Britain."</p>
<p>"What should I do now?"</p>
<p>"That little Bauer is coming. Tell him the news and tell him to report to the captain immediately. If we are captured, my urgent business will be delayed until who knows when."</p>
<p>The German radio operator came into the room, still chewing on a large piece of German salted biscuit. Jack told him the news he had just heard, and he was stunned in shock, and the salted biscuit fell to the ground.</p>
<p>"God!" By the time he could speak, he shouted. "Britain and Germany are at war, and a British ship is chasing us. Damn it! If they catch us, I, Hans Bauer, will become a prisoner, with no good food to eat, only bread and plain water—"</p>

<h3 id="e43">Same Surname <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>In China's patriarchal society, the power of those with the same surname is significant. To have a famous ancestor from whom one claims to be a "remote descendant" can certainly intimidate others. Even during clan fights, shouting "Everyone with the surname ×, attack!" can seize the initiative and secure victory.</p>
<p>Zhang Xianzhong, who nearly exterminated the people of Sichuan, wanted to establish a kinship with Emperor Wenchang and dared not destroy the temples of Zhang Huanhou. Huang Chao, who massacred eight million people, spared those with the surname Huang—even Huanggang and Huangmei counties were spared from slaughter simply because they bore the character "Huang" in their names. The influence of shared surnames extended even to bandits. It is no wonder that its power has not waned for thousands of years, and now it seems to be intensifying.</p>
<p>This so-called intensification is not just my conjecture. Some people, seeking to harness the power of shared surnames but finding no immediate way to do so, have resorted to imitating the Oath of the Peach Garden or emulating the Elegant Gathering in the Apricot Garden, forming sworn brotherhoods and registering genealogies to bolster their influence. Others have set their sights on numerous foreign tycoons. It is said that a certain "Gao Erchu," with "Er" as his generation name and "Foundation" as his ideal, not only sought to establish kinship with that great Russian writer but also to regard him as his compatriot and brother. Then, individuals with the surname Xiao, following the ancient examples of "Bo Da Bo Shi" or "Bo Yi Shu Qi," named themselves "Bo Gui" or "Shu Gui" to claim brotherhood with the British "George Bernard Shaw." ...</p>
<p>I imagine that in the future, this might indeed become a reality: someone with the surname "Ma" named "Kreis" or "Forbes"; someone with the surname "Zhang" named "Zhong Chang"; someone with the surname "Luo" named "Slugh"; someone with the surname "Shi" named "Danfeng" or "Qinglin"... It is a pity that China, apart from Mo Di, who was suspected of being an Indian charcoal merchant in ancient times, seems to have no one with the surname "Mo" now. And apart from Mr. Xi Yi, who lived reclusively on Mount Hua during the Five Dynasties period, there is no one with the surname "Xi." Otherwise, could not the "esteemed surnames" of modern eccentrics be used to draw these wonderful people with the surnames "Mo" and "Xi" into our "Hundred Family Surnames," creating a flourishing clan?</p>
<p>Some say that if the Chinese were to truly do this, there would be nothing wrong with it, because foreigners do the same. Many wealthy foreigners spend vast sums of money to have genealogies fabricated to prove that they are descendants of famous people. Many warlords or celebrities add words like "Von" or "Don" to their names to indicate that they are descendants of nobility. They even practice "endogamy," which is worse than China's "marriage prohibition between people of the same surname." But while this may be true, it misunderstands my point, because I do not look down on those who are keen on forming kinship and registering genealogies; on the contrary, I sincerely praise them. This only reinforces the greatness of the power of shared surnames, which has existed since ancient times in foreign countries as well.</p>
<p>However, foreign affairs are ultimately too vague, so let us turn back and talk about ourselves.</p>
<p>In some organizations, a particular surname dominates, from leaders to servants, most of whom share that surname. Some people call these organizations "family shrines of that surname," believing that this is inappropriate. However, I believe this is harmless: did we not have "General Yue's Army," "General Yang's Family," and "General Xue's Family" in ancient times? Moreover, the world has always been controlled by a single surname. Those who share a certain surname and follow the ancient ways are truly people of antiquity! People of antiquity! The dead are always good, and the ancients are especially good—if not "former kings," then at least "ancient people." We really should not recklessly criticize them.</p>
<p>Therefore, I not only agree with those who vigorously cultivate the power of shared surnames, but also want to offer some suggestions for their reference. I wonder what they think:</p>
<p>If the surname is "Kong," one can bring in "Kong Ming" and "Kong Que" (peacock) as close relatives, because those with the surnames "Zhu" and "Ge" have already looked up to Mr. Wolong (Zhuge Liang). Naturally, we with the surname "Kong" can follow suit and not lag behind. As for the "peacock," Yang Xiu of the Han Dynasty had long called it Confucius's domestic fowl. Similarly, those with the surname "Yang" can, as Kong Qun said, regard "Yangmei" (waxberry) as their family fruit; those with the surname "Han" can invite "Han Lu" (a famous hunting dog) into the clan... In this way, the power of your esteemed surname will become even more formidable, and everyone will look at you with awe, daring not to show disrespect.</p>
<p>A scholar with the surname "Liang" refused to acknowledge "Bo Yi" and "Tai Su" as his ancestors but was willing to claim "Lvzhu" and "Hongyu" (famous courtesans) as his ancestral aunts. Another clerk with the surname "Jiang" refused to casually establish kinship but claimed to be a descendant of "Jiang Zhushan" (a famous artist). These people are truly beyond foolish and deserve to be unsuccessful for life.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Underwater Farmland <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Several years ago, the Dutch government, due to the scarcity of land and large population, fought against the sea, spending huge sums of money to build a massive dam several miles from the coast. Then, they pumped out the water, leveled the land with soil, and it has now become a fertile field. This was all due to the Netherlands' world-leading hydraulic engineering, and its success and boldness are admirable. The Netherlands spent enormous manpower and resources to obtain a small piece of land, which reflects the preciousness of land in Europe. So, is it not a waste of natural resources to possess vast lands, fail to utilize them, and leave them barren, benefiting no one? The current issue of Magazine Digest reprinted an article from the London "Tingshe" newspaper, which records the situation of this new land. It is very interesting, and I will translate it below:</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, there is a place that was seabed eight years ago and is now a prosperous rural area. A few days ago, I had a pleasant conversation with a Dutch farmer who lived there. The farmhouses within the area were all built by the government, each with a granary and cow shed, arranged very cleanly. The farmer invited me to see their black and white cows, about thirty in total, lined up in a brightly lit shed. Next to each one was a copper can, and they would use their noses to lift the can's lid, then touch a mechanism, and clear water would flow out. This is not a tall tale; I personally witnessed their actions. Around the farmhouses, the land is flat, with fields crisscrossing, stretching endlessly. I have never seen such an orderly wilderness in any village I have visited. Even more, white and bright red farmhouses, like scattered stars, dotted the landscape, complementing each other. On the quiet brick roads, cars often sped past. All this makes it hard to imagine that just a few years ago, this place was seabed.</p>
<p>In this underwater farmland, there is now running water and electricity, and telephones will be available next year. All this comfort and safety depend on the 26-mile-long dam built on the coast of the Dutch West Sea, which blocks the waters of the North Sea and transforms the Zuyder Zee into a clear lake, at least the part of the lake that has not yet been reclaimed.</p>
<p>Before completing the great project, the Dutch government built small islands in the sea, and then gradually expanded the dikes until they formed a narrow opening. The rapid currents of the North Sea rushed into this narrow opening, with great force. Closing this narrow opening was extremely difficult; each time stones and gravel were poured down, they were swept away by the sea. But time after time, the narrow opening was finally closed successfully, and now the waters of the North Sea have succumbed to it. Farmers till the fields peacefully, and women sit quietly at home, listening to the radio broadcasts, enjoying the happiness of a pleasant countryside. They told me that it took six months to pump out the water from the first bay, and then two years to extract the salt contained in the soil. Initially, because the soil was loose and wet, horses could not be used for plowing, so machines were used instead. Since then, fields of barley, wheat, and rye have gradually appeared. Because this land was formed from the sea, many strange problems have arisen, one of which is the fish problem. For example, the fish of the Zuyder Zee were originally saltwater fish, but now they have become freshwater fish.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Depth and Originality <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>In times of suffering, to raise the banner of freedom and liberation, to write about the moving and inspiring deeds of brave warriors, the great achievements of success, or the painful sacrifices, to explore the hearts of countless vibrant souls, to transfer their hurried breaths amidst gunfire and bullets onto paper, to expose those walking corpses wearing masks whose insides are already rotten, to strip away their ugly coverings—whether you are sculpting a beautiful monument or exposing the ugliness of a depraved soul, you need to delve deeper, so that readers sing praises for beauty and gnash their teeth at ugliness.</p>
<p>Naturally, not only now, the primary function of literature has always been to infect the reader. A capable and conscientious writer would never want readers to remain indifferent after seeing their work. Often, the success of a work lies in captivating the reader's spirit. They can understand the author's emotions and reproduce the author's artistic conception. Therefore, the author's efforts are not in vain; the more they strive, the more the reader benefits.</p>
<p>There are naturally many factors that move the reader. Leaving aside the degree of appreciation, from the author's perspective, there are roughly the skill of technique, the richness of life experience, the burst of inspiration, and the depth of observation. Among these factors, in my opinion, deeper observation is the most crucial, and in the current situation, where some literature and art are somewhat formulaic, we also need this tonic.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the content of our literature and art has a common tendency, the faces presented should never be imitative and identical. This means that despite "convergence," there must be "divergence."</p>
<p>The impression of vagueness is often due to the author's perfunctoriness and negligence. If one cannot extract the core when observing a situation, and the analysis of personality is not deep enough, clinging to the surface, coupled with the inheritance of language, one often unknowingly uses many established phrases. This is naturally a lazy thing, but everyone is prone to laziness due to the influence of educational forces. Especially in the current stage of the War of Resistance literature and art, we have many opportunities to see the same type of writing. We have read a lot in this magazine and that supplement. Inadvertently, we accept the inheritance of culture. If we are not careful, we will mix the characters from other people's articles into our own when we write, and unconsciously use the established vocabulary. As a result, you cannot concentrate all your efforts to create a "unique personality." Your "personality" appears ordinary, popular, and without any special characteristics.</p>
<p>Wordsworth said in the preface to Lyrical Ballads: "To throw over common things a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect." These words seem mysterious, but in fact, they are simply asking us to avoid the commonplace. As long as we can carefully appreciate, extracting pearls from the keel dragon, there is fundamentally nothing commonplace in the world. It is only through similarity that there is the commonplace; similarity is still due to your lack of depth. It can be seen that as long as the author is patient and can extract differences from the ordinary, everything ordinary can be transformed into the extraordinary. This extraordinary is your originality.</p>
<p>Finally, I must briefly mention the method of delving deeper. According to Wordsworth, imagination can be used, but this is only suitable for the method of symbolism, and it is only suitable for poetry. At least in our modern China, we need to face the vast reality before us.</p>
<p>Let me transcribe a passage from Maupassant citing Flaubert to illustrate the method of delving deeper: "Talent is long patience! It is a matter of gazing intently and attentively for a long time at what one wants to express, in order to discover in it an aspect that has not yet been seen or said by anyone. Because when we use our own eyes, we inevitably recall the opinions of our predecessors on what we are looking at. So, in everything, there are still unexplored places. Even the most trivial things contain a little bit of the unknown. Go find it. In order to describe a burning fire, and a tree growing on the plain, we must keep facing this fire and this tree, until they appear different in our eyes from any other tree and any other fire." Go find it. What should we face?</p>
<p>For the sake of depth and originality, if possible, you should still see more of reality, so as not to build a cart behind closed doors at home.</p>

<p>— Wei Ming</p>
<p>After a long and frantic run, I have finally stopped to catch my breath here.</p>
<p>×, you must be laughing at me. Yes, I myself don't understand why. I have changed, and often I am lost in thought alone for a long time, without saying or moving, staring blankly at the white clouds or stars. Being in such a "cage," surrounded by gloom, everything looks like it has been coated with a layer of dark gray when I look out of the window. So, I too feel like I have been painted with a heavy dark gray, and I feel waves of coldness coming over me.</p>
<p>You know that I deeply love the rain in my hometown, and recently I have missed it even more. When a person is lonely, memories of the past naturally come to mind. Even trivial and ridiculous things can make me nostalgic, and now is the season of rain in my hometown!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When the sunlight timidly withdraws the gold smeared on the tips of the willows, and the whirlwind whistles, tightening one moment and then tightening again, it is like rain that nourishes the soul! I call it rain that nourishes the soul not without reason, and I need it! Receiving its invitation, I hold my beloved book and lie on the cot in the bamboo garden behind the house, quietly listening to the subtle sound of the rain, as if played on the strings of the heart, savoring the mournful and beautiful verses. My attention is divided equally between them.</p>
<p>Drip! Drip, falling on the sharp, vividly colored leaves that seem about to melt, as if telling an ancient and sweet story, and then falling again, each time bursting with round and clear sounds. Opening my eyes, a flash of white light jumps over, which is the small stream surrounding the bamboo garden, as crystal clear as a beautiful silver ribbon. Raindrops touch its face, and immediately smiling ripples leap, letting the drizzle caress my hair. I truly understand the meaning of "the wise find joy in water."</p>
<p>I also like the refreshing and comfortable atmosphere after the rain, the dazzling green of the washed leaves, and the small grass that grows more tenderly and angrily.</p>
<p>I don't have the courage to recall, and writing to you, I am complaining in a painful tone, and also raising a faint sorrow like light clouds.</p>
<p>×, you should understand me.</p>

<p>4.  The Difficulty of the Shu Road</p>
<p>Passing the Stone Buddha Mountain, one gradually enters deep mountains and high valleys, and the further one goes, the more imposing the mountains become. There are no signs of human habitation or trees on all sides, but only towering stone walls, soaring into the clouds, which give people a sense of grandeur. The road winds and twists, climbing the mountain peaks, so the car travels very slowly. We are intoxicated by the scenery around us, forgetting how long we have been driving. Presently, we found that we had climbed to the top of the mountain. Looking down, the cliffs were thousands of feet, and we could not see the bottom. No matter how healthy and strong-hearted a person is, after seeing this bottomless and dangerous scene, they will immediately feel weak and unable to support themselves. The driver, although accustomed to and familiar with such dangerous roads, of course, dares not look aside at all. Because if he glances to the side, his heart will be happy, his eyes will be blurred, and he will drive the car to the bottom of the valley, turning both people and the car into shattered pieces. Arriving at this point, only those few courageous passengers dare to take a look. After seeing it, you say a sentence, he says a sentence, saying how dangerous it is, and what would happen if we fell down. The old woman, about fifty years old, with five children, both boys and girls, said superstitiously:</p>
<p>"Don't talk too much! Don't be talkative! Everyone is safe."</p>
<p>Her second and third daughters, although only thirteen or fourteen years old, were very naughty. They said:</p>
<p>"Mom, we want to see."</p>
<p>The young male passenger next to her immediately grabbed the small girl's hands, saying:</p>
<p>"Little sister, don't look down, look up, there are white clouds flying around the mountain, birds singing, and the sun, which is both warm and bright."</p>
<p>The mother immediately followed up, saying:</p>
<p>"Sun! Sun! The sun shines on us all the way, safe and sound, home." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e48">Illness Enters from Within: He Ruitang's Broadcast Speech on Cholera Prevention and Treatment; Cholera Cases in Hong Kong Show a Gradual Spread This Week; Certificates Required for Travel to Macau and Vietnam <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Recently, cholera has broken out in Hong Kong and is spreading rapidly. There have been several deaths as a result. To alert the community to the importance of prevention, Mr. He Gantang delivered a broadcast speech last night at 8 p.m., highlighting the importance of cholera prevention. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Cholera is Dangerous, and Its Harm is the Most Severe</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, tonight I am entrusted by the government's Chief Medical Officer Situ Yongjue to speak about the dangers of cholera, as well as methods of prevention and treatment. Cholera is a disease characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and cramps, and its harm is the most severe. It spreads extremely quickly because it originates internally from exposure to cold and heat, as well as from toxins. This leads to muscle spasms, exhaustion, and often death. The source of the disease is actually caused by a type of bacteria that contaminates things that are drunk or eaten (especially drinking water, milk, or fruits or vegetables) and invades the human body. It usually occurs from May or June in the summer until October or November. Moreover, the population of Hong Kong has increased by approximately 700,000 from 1937 to this year, and the population density is high. Therefore, in 1937, the number of cholera cases reached more than 1,600. Last year, after I gave a detailed speech on this disease on the broadcast, the authorities strictly prohibited the sale of cold foods and peeled or rotten fruits, herbal jelly, bean curd jelly, etc., and informed residents to get cholera vaccinations free of charge, which was a great help in eliminating cholera. Furthermore, residents actively assisted the authorities in jointly managing the situation, so in 1938, there were only more than 500 cases throughout the year, which was two-thirds less than in 1937. This year, the disease has occurred again, and as of yesterday, there were 79 cases. We still hope that everyone will take the same precautions as before to prevent the spread of this disease. Now, I will announce the various prevention methods again, so that everyone is aware:</p>
<p>Be Careful with Food and Drink to Prevent Infection</p>
<p>The most important prevention method is to never eat raw vegetables. They must be cooked thoroughly before they can be eaten. Raw fruits, especially those that have been cut open or have rotten peels, should be avoided. Even raw fruits with peels should be eaten sparingly. Clams, raw oysters, raw shrimp, and raw fish must also be cooked before eating. Water and milk, or cream, must also be boiled before drinking. Ice cream, frozen jelly, herbal jelly, bean curd jelly, *wentouluo*, ice water, etc., are all harmful and should not be eaten. However, ice cream and soda water that are produced by well-known stores and have undergone disinfection can be consumed. Not only should one be careful with food and drink, but also the chopsticks, bowls, plates, knives, forks, cups, and other utensils used for cooking in the kitchen should be washed thoroughly with boiling water and dried before use. The most effective way to spread this disease is through flies, ants, centipedes, etc. Because flies like to gather on feces, garbage, and the most unclean and rotten things, they spread the cholera bacteria to food. If you are not careful with your diet, you can easily get infected. If you see flies gathering on cooked vegetables, do not eat them. If you think it is a pity to throw them away, then cook the vegetables again before eating them. If someone has cholera, not only is their life at stake, but also the clothes and bedding they have worn and used must be washed with disinfectant water or sterilized with sulfur before they can be used again. If there is no flush toilet in the house, the used waste buckets must be tightly covered, as must the garbage cans, to prevent flies from spreading the infection.</p>
<p>Public Hospitals Offer Free Injections</p>
<p>As for the best way to prevent infection with this disease, it is best to get a cholera vaccination in advance. Within five months after the vaccination, you can avoid infection with this disease. Even if you do get infected, it will be in a small number of cases, and the symptoms will be easier to treat. Currently, a large number of cholera vaccines and medicines have been shipped and distributed to residents for vaccination, free of charge, and without pain. There is no need to panic. There may be some slight pain, but it will only last for a few hours. If you apply a hot water-soaked towel to your mouth at this time, you can stop the pain. Residents of Hong Kong who wish to get vaccinated to avoid infection with this disease can go to: (1) Queen Mary Hospital, (2) the old site of the National Hospital on Queen's Road, opposite the Ko Shing Theatre, (3) Tung Wah Hospital, (4) Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, (5) West Point Public Medical Office, 105 Third Street, (6) Central District Public Medical Office, 3 Aberdeen Street, (7) Eastern District Public Medical Office, Stone Nullah Lane, Wan Chai, (8) Lady Grantham Health Centre, Johnston Road, (9) Shau Kei Wan Public Medical Office. Residents of the opposite shore can go to: (1) Kowloon Hospital, (2) Kwong Wah Hospital, (3) Ma Tei Public Medical Office, Kansu Street, (4) Hung Hom Public Medical Office, Kwun Yum Temple Street, (5) Sham Shui Po Public Medical Office, (6) Kowloon City Public Medical Office, Kak Hang Tsuen Road, (7) Yuen Long Public Medical Office, (8) Tai Po Public Medical Office. One vaccination per person is sufficient. If residents can afford it, please consult a doctor for vaccination to avoid overcrowding at the public vaccination centers. If you have been infected with this disease, it is best to go to the National Hospital, Tung Wah Hospital, or Kwong Wah Hospital for treatment. Otherwise, please consult a Western doctor, or a Chinese person who has studied Western medicine and has a license. Because it is the rule in Hong Kong, it must be done this way.</p>
<p>Consult a Doctor and Make Accommodations</p>
<p>Because many residents are poor and have difficulty finding a Western doctor, and sometimes there are no beds available in hospitals, I have discussed the situation with the health officials and requested accommodation. If the patient is in critical condition in the middle of the night or during the day, can a Chinese medicine practitioner be allowed to treat them? However, after the treatment, the Chinese medicine practitioner or a relative of the patient should immediately, or on the following day, report to the Royal Health Officer on the third floor of the Post Office so that it can be registered. After registration, the Royal [Officer] will definitely take the patient to the infectious disease hospital in Kennedy Town, Sai Wan, or Lai Chi Kok on the opposite shore. After three or four days, they will be allowed to return home, so as to prevent the patient from infecting the residents on the same floor. This method has been approved and is hereby announced, so that all residents can follow this method to avoid violating Hong Kong law, which is of utmost importance. This year, more than 100,000 people have already been vaccinated at the above locations. In addition, there are many residents who can afford to consult a doctor for vaccination themselves. Residents of Hong Kong often like to bathe in the sea in the hot summer, but it is not advisable to bathe in seawater that is not far from the city and is clean, because recently, many new buildings in Hong Kong have water closets, and the old sewage flows into the sea, causing the water at the seaside to be slightly unclean. If you get infected, you can also get sick. I hope that all men and women will do their best to follow the methods of vaccination and prevention mentioned in this article, and work together to avoid too much spread. If we do not take precautions, and if cholera becomes severely prevalent, all countries will inevitably recognize Hong Kong as a plague port. Ships departing from Hong Kong to other ports will have to enter quarantine to carry out epidemic prevention work. In this case, both passengers and shipping companies will suffer losses. Therefore, ships coming to and from Hong Kong will inevitably have to increase fares to compensate. As a result, food prices in Hong Kong will inevitably rise, and many unfavorable circumstances will occur at the same time. This is just one example. Given these advantages and disadvantages, I earnestly hope that compatriots will work together to prevent and eradicate cholera. First, we can protect our own lives. Second, we can protect social harmony. Third, we can protect the prosperity of Hong Kong. This is my sincere hope.</p>
<p>Macau Epidemic Prevention Starts on the 19th</p>
<p>The Macau authorities have decided to implement epidemic prevention measures from the 19th of this month. Yesterday, they issued a notice stating that passengers arriving in Macau by ship or plane from cholera-affected areas (including Hong Kong) must carry a doctor's certificate with a photo attached. It is valid from six days after the date of the vaccination for four months. Those going to Macau must comply with the new regulations, otherwise they will not be allowed to land.</p>
<p>Vietnam Strictly Checks Certificates</p>
<p>In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the Vietnamese health authorities have recently stipulated that passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Vietnam must obtain a doctor's examination certificate in Hong Kong in advance and be vaccinated against smallpox and other epidemic diseases before being allowed to enter the country, otherwise they will be returned on the same ship. After receiving this notice from Vietnam, shipping companies in Hong Kong also require passengers traveling to Vietnam to have a doctor's certificate before they can purchase a ticket. However, some people in the community do not have time to see a doctor and purchase a ticket in Hong Kong, so they borrow other people's certificates to replace them, which is discovered by the Vietnamese authorities and they are not allowed to land. At the same time, the examination of doctors' certificates upon entry has been strengthened. Overseas Chinese going to Vietnam should pay attention to avoid losses.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Student Relief Association recently held an executive committee meeting to discuss the commemoration of the second anniversary of the "July 7th" War of Resistance. As a result, it was decided to launch a campaign to present a portrait of Chairman Chiang, the significance of which is to commemorate the hard work and meritorious achievements of the supreme leader, to raise funds to comfort the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines, and to achieve two goals at once. The portraits are divided into two types: three-dimensional plaster statues and badge-shaped photographic impressions. The former will be distributed to various associations, schools, and shops for decoration, while the latter will be distributed to individuals to wear on this day to commemorate their past. The association has been actively carrying out this resolution for several days, and it is expected that it can be sent out before the first of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Police Officer Bribery Case; Trial Opened Yesterday Afternoon; Secretary of Xie An Proves the Use of 100 Dollars; Judge Orders the Case to Be Adjourned Until This Afternoon for Retrial <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The case of Ruan Zhaoji, the interpreter of the Hung Hom Police Station, and Yi Huashi, the British assistant officer, who were accused of soliciting bribes from Liu Xiyu, caused a sensation for a time. People in Hong Kong believed that the Hong Kong authorities were strictly enforcing official regulations and reforming officialdom. The fact that a British deputy officer was accused in court, and that his crime was soliciting bribes, was unprecedented in Hong Kong since its opening. Therefore, when the Kowloon Magistrate's Court continued the trial yesterday afternoon, even more people came to observe. The court opened, and first, Yin Weixian, the interpreter of the Hung Hom Police Station, testified, saying that at 7:10 a.m. on April 23, he saw a bus ticket seller and the plaintiff come to the police station together. He had met the plaintiff before, but did not know his name. Then, the officer on duty ordered him to inquire about the dispute between the two parties. However, the officer on duty was busy preparing a report. Later, he saw the British police officer Feidun enter the police station, and he immediately ordered Feidun to inquire about the case. After a while, he saw the officer on duty leave the detention center, and the plaintiff was standing in front of his writing desk. At 10:15 a.m., the first defendant returned to the station from outside to be on duty. About two minutes later, he also went off duty. After answering the cross-examination of Shao Yali, the lawyer representing the first defendant, he continued to answer the cross-examination of Xiao Zhongshi, the lawyer representing the second defendant, the British deputy officer Yi Huashi, saying that after the officer instructed him to order the bus ticket seller to leave, he did not see Ruan Zhaoji take the plaintiff into the Chinese detective's office. He continued to say that the officer on duty was as usual that day. At this time, he was busy with his work, so he did not pay attention. The officer on duty had returned to the police station several times that morning. In short, his observation that day made him feel that the officer on duty did not intend to sue Liu Xiyu.</p>
<p>Next, Wu Daxing testified, saying that he had been transferred to the Hung Hom Police Station for two months. On April 23, he was on duty from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. During this time, he had arrested a hawker and returned to the police station, but the Chinese interpreter was no longer at the police station. It was not until 10:50 a.m. that he saw the first defendant, Ruan Zhaoji, return to the police station from outside. Then, Jia Lidengtang, the British Detective Chief Superintendent, said that on the morning of April 23, he happened to be at the Yau Ma Tei Police Station. At 8:10 a.m., the British officer Yi Huashi called him from the Hung Hom Police Station, saying that an old man had used two counterfeit one-mao coins, and a bus ticket seller refused to use them. The man then gave him a ten-dollar bill, but the ticket seller refused to give him change, and said that the two parties had arrived at the police station. He saw his report and instructed him to investigate the person's history in detail. By 9:30 a.m., Yi Huashi called him again, saying that although the man had two counterfeit coins, he had a job and worked for the Whampoa Dock. He ordered him to release the person. Later, on May 4, he asked Yi Huashi to take a statement. At that time, Yi Yishi said that he was suspected of being involved in the case, and he had to consult a lawyer before answering. When the case was filed on May 25, Yi Huashi said that he denied the crime he was accused of this time, and he reserved all defenses. Then, Liang Jiejuan testified that at one o'clock that morning, he saw the plaintiff and a young man enter the Xie An Club together. When they arrived at the building, Liu suddenly asked the secretary Ma Qi to borrow 100 yuan in cash. Ma counted it and gave it to him. When Liu took out a ten-dollar bill from his body and placed it together with the one-hundred-dollar bill, the young man immediately said, "Isn't it 120 yuan?" But the young man eventually took away the 110 yuan. Later, during the identification, he recognized that the young man was the current first defendant. Finally, Ma Qi, the secretary of the Xie An Club, testified that the plaintiff had asked him for 100 yuan in cash that day. After he gave it to him, he wrote on the ledger, "Paid Liu Nian (i.e., the plaintiff) 100 yuan." Next to it, he also wrote the word "police officer." At this point, the judge ordered the case to be adjourned until this afternoon for retrial.</p>

<p>At 7:00 a.m. on the 13th, the Imperial Airways plane, the "Philippine", departed from Kai Tak Airport for Singapore. There was only one female passenger on board, who was returning to England. However, during the takeoff run, it suddenly got stuck in the mud and was stuck and difficult to move. It was ordered that coolies dig out the mud and push the plane onto hard ground before it could take off. It was delayed for two hours. The "Delia" was damaged in Annam some time ago. It has now been repaired and arrived in Hong Kong on the 13th, but it was an empty plane without mail or passengers.</p>

<p>At 5:30 a.m. on the 11th, a foreign man was found injured and lying on the ground in front of a certain number at the intersection of Peking Road and Hankow Road in Kowloon. Passers-by discovered him and reported it to the police on duty, who sent him to the hospital in a Red Cross ambulance. He died of his injuries en route. Afterwards, it was found that the deceased was the American Jin Beier, an employee of the China Aviation Machinery Trading Company. Details have been published in the newspapers. Recently, the police authorities, in order to thoroughly investigate the cause of death, have dispatched detectives to investigate separately. According to the information obtained, when Jin was found injured, a young girl in a cheongsam with disheveled hair ran away from the scene, which was quite suspicious. As for the deceased's whereabouts that night, he had a small drink at the Peninsula Hotel at 1:00 a.m. that day, but he was not drunk and was very conscious. At 4:00 a.m. that morning, someone saw him at the "Cao Jiage Lao" Hotel. It has not been possible to find out when he left, or what happened until the incident. According to the deceased's friends, the deceased was neatly dressed when he went out that night, but when he was found injured on the road, he was only wearing a shirt and trousers. According to Western news, the deceased's coat was found by detectives in a woman's house yesterday, and the deceased's letters in the Western Youth Association were also taken away by the police authorities for investigation. This case has been handed over to Detective Deputy Ninghan for handling.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Overseas Chinese Who Care About the Motherland Should Accept a New Baptism; Highly Recommend "War of Resistance China"; Premiering Today at the Central Theatre <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>This is good news:</p>
<p>"War of Resistance China" is produced by the Central Film Studio. The sound, lighting... and conditions of film art are all very satisfactory. In terms of content, it is the facts of the struggling China and the newborn China. The film was recently screened at the Central Theatre to invite cultural circles, making viewers feel like they were thrown into the arms of the motherland. The whole atmosphere was tense and inspiring. Everyone was warmed by the light, evaporating with the glory of victory. Starting today, "War of Resistance China" will be officially released at the Central Theatre. In order to allow our beloved overseas Chinese to receive a new baptism from the motherland, the reporter has an unshirkable duty to give readers a general report:</p>
<p>"War of Resistance China" is divided into five episodes: It is composed of the latest newsreels and war zone films.</p>
<p>The first episode, Sha Wang took office in Chongqing, showing unprecedented national unity. The Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League participated in the tree planting ceremony, symbolizing "ten years to plant trees, a hundred years to cultivate people" is our grand plan. After watching the National Oath, we can discover the great power lurking in every corner. The annual meeting of the Literary Association and Lao She's work report are undoubtedly a cordial encouragement to our cultural workers. How innocent and lively are the little masters in Children's Day, and how exciting is the army comfort in Baishi.</p>
<p>The second episode, after the bombing by the enemy, the ruthless flames are burning fiercely. The ruined walls and dead bodies make people feel heartbroken and sad. "Only hatred," one only has revenge, "War of Resistance to the end," "an eye for an eye," with passionate and powerful oaths, causing the audience to resonate, and applause thundered. The British Consulate in Chongqing was also bombed, letting those with eyes see the true face of the enemy. Young girls and students diligently sew clothes for the soldiers on the expedition. After the bombing, the service team distributed relief tea and porridge. The military and civilians are integrated, which is so inspiring.</p>
<p>The third episode, is the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Chairman Chiang and party and state leaders such as Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, Chen Cheng... appeared on the screen, and bursts of applause reflected the people's love for the leaders and senior generals. Chairman Chiang's firm and earnest instructions made the entire audience feel as if they were being trained in person. The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session stated: "The party itself must be hardworking, humble, brave, and courageous." I sincerely hope that party members will follow the leader's intentions and set an example. Our compatriots across the country must also practice what they advocate, encourage each other, and the corrupt China is dead! A lively China is reborn!</p>
<p>The fourth episode, has liveliness in solemnity, and interest in tension. The New Life Exhibition, in addition to telling us that domestic medicines and machinery have made great strides towards science, the rationalized clothing, food, housing, and transportation are also very interesting. The simple and neat men's and women's clothing proudly indicate: "This is our China!" The Chinese and Western buffet is also a good phenomenon of progress. Sanitary housing is showing the future new China, which will improve the living standards of the masses in this way. Mass weddings, needless to say, are also an interesting scene.</p>
<p>During the women's donation campaign, in addition to Mrs. Chiang's speech, Chairman Chiang also gave a speech in the midst of enthusiastic applause. There is a long time to look up to the dignity of the leader, which can satisfy the hopes of every citizen. After being inspired by the leader, they are more optimistic about the future of the country.</p>
<p>The concert of the Lizhi Society played very pleasant and moving music. In the song "War of Resistance to the End" sung by the chorus, the slogan "If you have a gun, take a gun, if you have a pen, take a pen" shows us that "400 million people are of one mind" is also imprinted in the minds of every audience.</p>
<p>The fifth episode, is the prelude to victory. It has "Clouds of the South China Sea" and the real scenes of Guangzhou and Wuhan, evoking our memories of our homeland. The applause was the most enthusiastic when the guerrillas and regular army charged into the enemy positions. This is a sign of returning our homeland.</p>

At that time, the Chinese detective had a street battle with the bandits, resulting in one bandit being shot and killed, and the Chinese detective Yin Wen also died of his injuries on the 11th. The police arrested Liu Wenzhu that day and sent him to the Central Magistrate's Court, accusing him of colluding with the deceased Liu Yafang to beat Zhang Dazhi, and of intending to rob him, and of illegally possessing a pistol with five rounds of ammunition. Yesterday morning, the defendant was escorted by the Justice Department to court again. Crane Jianshi, the officer in charge of this case, told the judge that the injured Chinese detective had passed away, and the police might change the defendant's charges to murder.

<h3 id="e61">Police Detectives Searched Dart Entertainment Venues Last Night; Four Arrested and Released on Bail Pending Trial; Prosperity Resumes as Usual After Police Depart <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>When "dart entertainment venues" first appeared in Hong Kong, there were only a few in Central. However, in a short period of time, they have spread throughout Sai Wan and Wan Chai, with an estimated number of no less than several hundred throughout Hong Kong. Although the organizers of this type of dart game euphemistically call it "entertainment with great prizes," it actually contains an element of gambling. The prize system is ostensibly a gift, but in reality, it is a deceptive trick. Many ignorant women, children, apprentices, and servants are attracted to these "entertainment venues," indulging in them day and night, wasting money and time. The harm is even greater than that of "zi fa" and "zi dan." Moreover, in these types of venues, criminals mingle, and disputes often arise due to gambling competition, affecting local order. Members of society hope that the government will strictly ban these venues to maintain public safety. The police authorities have also paid close attention to the rapid rise of "dart venues." The night before last, between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM, the Central Police Station suddenly dispatched a patrol car with an officer leading a group of policemen to dart stalls in Gough Street, Gage Street, and Stanley Street in Central District for a surprise inspection. At that time, men and women gathered at the stalls to gamble, and upon seeing the police detectives, they scattered and fled in disarray. The police detectives searched the stalls and arrested two people in charge and two gamblers, taking them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were brought before Magistrate Arthur Edwards at the Central Magistracy. The men, surnamed Wen and Chen, were charged with operating dart venues on Aberdeen Street and Stanley Street. Huang and Li were charged with gambling. Prosecutor Officer Hawkins requested that the court adjourn the case for one week before further hearings. The first two defendants were granted bail of $50 each, and the third and fourth defendants were granted bail of $3 each, pending trial. It was also noted that when the police detectives searched the dart venues, nearby dart venues closed their doors. However, after the police detectives left, they reopened and gamblers gathered again.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Resolves Yesterday to Continue Operating the Library; Hong Kong's Only Library to Be Preserved; Expansion Due to Economic Constraints Difficult to Realize <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a general meeting of members yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM on the fourth floor of the association's building. Attendees included Chairman Li Xingqu and dozens of others. After the meeting began, the treasurer first read the meeting notice, followed by Chairman Li Xingqu announcing the purpose of the meeting. Then, discussion items began: (1) Approval of last year's yearbook: Proposed by Chen Jianbo, seconded by Gao Liangqing (passed); (2) Election of ten supervisors to manage the 14th Board of Directors election: Lei Yin-sun, Liu Jingqing, Zhou Xingchi, Feng Qizhuo, Xing Yuming, Ma Boping, Cao Fuzhao, Du Zewen, Chen Zhongchi, and Li Zhuoquan were nominated on the spot; (4) Setting the date for ballot closing, verification, and counting: After the general meeting, the supervisors held a temporary meeting and decided that July 4th would be the ballot closing date, July 5th would be the ballot verification date, and July 6th would be the ballot counting date; (5) Discussion of relocating the library: Attendees paid special attention to this issue, and everyone strongly advocated that it should not be relocated and should continue to be operated on the fourth floor of the association's building. Zhou Xingchi spoke first, saying that the association's library has been established for ten years. Several years ago, the number of people visiting the library to read books increased daily, and seats were often unavailable. At that time, Ou Zesen suggested expansion and proposed renting neighboring buildings to expand the space. However, after several negotiations, an agreement could not be reached, so the matter was dropped. This is the only Chinese cultural organization in Hong Kong, with ten years of history to date. If it were to be moved to another location, even if it were not closed, the new location would be the Confucius Society, and the location of that society is not as good as this association. It is better to continue to preserve and operate it in its current location. Chen Jianbo then said that according to the library's budget over the past few years, it has not been exceeded since 1935. This shows that whether the library is relocated or not has no bearing on the budget. At the same time, the association's location is convenient, and the number of people coming to read books is increasing with time. If it were to be moved to the Confucius Society, transportation would be inconvenient and access would be difficult. It is believed that the number of readers would decrease, which would run counter to the original intention of establishing the association. Several years ago, due to the problem of limited space, old newspapers were moved to the rooftop and the purchase of new books was stopped to avoid occupying more space. Deng Yutang said that since the association's library was established in 1929, it has continued to operate until now and has been praised by the community. We should do our best to promote it to avoid tarnishing the past reputation of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. In my humble opinion, we should solicit donations to expand the library so that the association can become a leading organization in the business community. The association's rental income from the second floor is only a little over a thousand dollars per year. The association also donates this amount to the University of Hong Kong. It would be better to take back this income, move the third-floor office to the first floor, and expand the third floor into a library so that people from all walks of life can have a large space to consult books and newspapers. As for the budget, we can assess the situation at the time and consider donations. This type of cultural organization should not only not be relocated, but should also be expanded to accommodate more readers, especially in today's Hong Kong, where there are millions of Chinese people and only this small library for reading. The chairman expressed great sympathy for Deng's suggestion, saying that the library established by the association is indeed inadequate, with limited space and a lack of books. It should have been expanded into a grand library long ago to live up to the expectations of the community. However, the economic issue is the most important factor for every undertaking. I hope everyone will work together and make donations to make it happen, and not just make empty promises. Ou Zesen then proposed to keep the library in its current location and continue to operate it, which was unanimously approved. Finally, the issue of restoring elevator access for readers was discussed. As a result, it was decided that it could not be restored because the elevator was too old, had been in disrepair for a long time, and there were concerns that it would be overloaded and cause danger if too many people came to read books. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

<p>(North Red Express News) The Guangdong North troops have recently received reinforcements, plotting unusual movements. However, our army is using mobile tactics to attack, causing the enemy to be contained everywhere and exhausted. On the 9th, a certain division of our army launched an attack towards Hengtan near Xinjie, with small gains. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Reinforcements to Jiangcun</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, enemy troops on the Yue Road front line arrived in Jiangcun in a military vehicle loaded with enemy soldiers from the Ishii area to reinforce them. The unit number is the Suzuki unit of the 104th Division. Also on the same day, more than ten other enemy military vehicles, carrying 500 soldiers and supplies, arrived from Guangzhou North to Renge and Longxiang. According to statistics, in the past week, the enemy has reinforced the Huaxian and Yue Road New Street areas with approximately two thousand soldiers. However, this is only for defensive purposes. The original enemy soldiers stationed there have suffered heavy casualties due to our attacks and surprise attacks. Many corpses have been transported back to the Liuhua Bridge area in the northern suburbs of Guangzhou for cremation.</p>
<p>Our Attack on Hengtan</p>
<p>In addition, enemy forces in Longkouxiang have recently been attacked by our army. The remnants have retreated and replenished themselves in Hengtan, Yuzhongtan, and other places near Xinjie. On the afternoon of the 9th, the Wang regiment of our Zhao division launched an attack on the enemy troops in Hengtan, engaging in a fierce battle for two hours, annihilating over twenty enemy soldiers and seizing several guns. In recent days, fierce battles have continued near Xinjie. Our and enemy positions have changed along the village pond embankment, and the situation is intensely stalemate. Our local guerrillas have established very close contact with the army and have obtained sufficient ammunition replenishment, making them a strong force and repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy.</p>

<p>(City Sea Urgent News) On the evening of the 6th, at around 8:00 PM, guerrillas from the Nanhai Sanshui area secretly removed fifteen pairs of railway tracks on the Guangsan Road between Shizi Bao and Xiaotang, and disguised the roadbed with wooden tracks to conceal the damage from the enemy. In the early morning of the 7th, a empty military vehicle loaded with military supplies to resupply the enemy troops in Sanshui traveled from the southwest towards the east through Fochu, carrying a small team of thirty soldiers. The enemy had not noticed anything beforehand. At 7:00 AM, when the vehicle arrived at the damaged section of wooden tracks in Xiaotang Shizi Dou, the tracks could not withstand the pressure and collapsed with a loud noise. The enemy military vehicle derailed and overturned. The enemy soldiers in the carriage were unable to escape and were crushed to death on the spot, killing over ten people. Around 8:00 AM, enemy troops from Foshan arrived, dispatched thirty engineers in vehicles to provide rescue and transport the wounded and dead enemy soldiers back to Foshan for treatment. They were incensed against the villagers.</p>
<p>After the enemy military vehicle was damaged, the enemy, filled with extreme resentment, sent over a hundred enemy soldiers to Lion Mountain, arbitrarily pointing fingers at the local villagers, indiscriminately shooting and killing people, and setting fire to over twenty civilian houses. They only withdrew at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<p>(Shantou Express News) Since the 12th of this month, the Shantou enemy fleet has added one large-caliber gunboat and one cruiser, all stationed outside Nan'ao, plus the two destroyers originally stationed outside Mamuyu, for a total of four vessels. On the 12th and 13th, the enemy dispatched boats to spy on the Mamuyu blockade line. Our garrison was on high alert, and the enemy did not succeed. Chaoshan is as peaceful as usual. According to a senior military official here, the enemy's spying on Mamuyu will not affect our defense. It is expected that the enemy's arrival may not be here. Rather, they are testing a feint to the east and attack in the west tactic, secretly launching an attack, and our military deployments everywhere have learned to strictly prevent this, and we can guarantee nothing will be lost.</p>

<p>(Shaoguan Express News) General Zhang Fakui, acting commander of the Fourth War Zone, following the instructions of the highest military authorities, adheres to the principle that guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare in the second phase of the war of resistance.

Yesterday, in conjunction with the headquarters of a certain army group, he compiled "Key Points of Guerrilla Warfare" and distributed them to the commanders of various regional columns to ensure that the most effective strategies are used to achieve the goals and tasks of guerrilla warfare.</p>

<p>(Zhongshan Express News) On the 12th, enemy warships shelled Xiaolan from the Shunde River surface, landing in the northwest area of Lan Town, collapsing the tiles and walls of two civilian houses. Fortunately, no one was injured. It was discovered that Tongren Hospital, which was founded by Americans and flies the American flag, is located in this area. It is run by American doctors and has achieved considerable success. It was harmed today. It can be seen that the enemy disregards international trust and acts recklessly. Fortunately, the patients in the hospital fled in sickness upon hearing the shelling, avoiding being bombed. There are still three enemy warships on the Yinggezui River surface, constantly shuttling back and forth, visible from a distance from Shakou in Zhongshan.</p>

<p>Last night, three matches were held for the public men's Group B basketball qualifiers for the finals. In the first match, Guangzhong played Peiying. After a hard-fought battle, Guangzhong was defeated by a single move, losing 26-43. In the second match, Li Xing played International. Both teams are strong teams in this tournament. This battle is inevitably a contest for the championship and runner-up, so before the start of the game, it was expected that Li Xing would be victorious, as Li Xing has been invincible since its debut and its strength is extremely strong. Unexpectedly, after contact, the two sides fought fiercely. International went all out and maintained the advantage. Li Xing's entire team performed poorly in the first half. Lin Youpei and Huang Jiuwu's shots were inaccurate, and the defense was repeatedly broken by International's Li Fuqi, Li Bonian, and Yuan Fangtao. After breaking into the second half, Lin Youpei, Chen Yuting, Zhang Dezhang, and Chen Chengji all worked hard and once chased back to 33-34. Unfortunately, at the last moment, the defense was poor, and Li Bonian and Guo Si from International launched attacks from both sides, and Li Xing lost 33-38. Overall, both sides performed well in this game. International's offense and defense were suitable, while Li Xing's defense was weak, and the change of players and disordered scheduling were also the reasons for their defeat. In the final match, Huaxiong resisted Chunfeng. The two sides fought fiercely. The first half ended in a 27-27 tie. After changing sides, Huaxiong continued to press forward, but Chunfeng responded calmly, taking advantage of the opportunities to launch repeated attacks. After Huaxiong stubbornly resisted, they lacked energy, and Chunfeng's long-range and close-range shots were invincible. At the end of the game, they won a big victory with 59-46.</p>
<h3 id="e77">School Volleyball Tournament; Southwest B Defeats Deming; Paul Defeats Yinghuang <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Two junior-level school volleyball tournament games were held yesterday. In the first game, Southwest B played Deming. Southwest prepared carefully, while Deming's defense was not perfect and was repeatedly broken by Southwest. They lost the first game 16-21 first. Deming, seeing the loss, immediately tried to counterattack. Ou Xueguang, Situ Qin, Gao Zian, Wu Ganmin, and Zheng Hanxing launched attacks from five directions. Southwest's Rong Zequan, Liang Jinbiao, Liang Jinchang, and Liang Chuguan also worked together to resist, but Deming's momentum was strong and they won the second game 21-17. Taking advantage of the momentum, Deming frequently put pressure on Southwest. However, Southwest's army fought very hard and could not be attacked, while Southwest again took the third game 21-19. After that, Deming lacked stamina and had no fighting spirit, repeatedly failing to break through Southwest's defenses, losing the fourth game again 1-21. Southwest won 3-1.</p>
<p>In the second game, Paul played Yinghuang. Paul's fighting strength was better than Yinghuang's, and the whole army was able to bravely go forward. Yinghuang's defense was weak, and their offensive power could not be used freely. Paul won 3-1. The first game was 21-17, the second game was 21-11, the third game was 9-21, and the fourth game was 21-14. The lineups of each team are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e79">Wishing Xu Chengji Could Fulfill His Lofty Ambitions <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Xu Chengji went abroad in 1935. Before he went abroad, some people had already discussed his future, saying that he was a genius tennis player. If someone could provide funding to send him to travel to European and American countries, and compete and learn from famous players from various countries, then his skills would definitely improve further. It was said that he might even reach the ranks of the world's top ten players and win some glory overseas for China, which was lagging behind in sports.</p>
<p>Later, he indeed received funding from the Ministry of Education to go abroad and worked and studied in a certain place in France. His life was quite difficult. However, he was a promising young man and was not restricted by the environment. He often strived for his own future.</p>
<p>Soon, the Ministry of Education stopped his subsidies. Fortunately, overseas Chinese living in Java were willing to help him and often sent remittances for his living expenses. Therefore, he did not return home halfway but remained overseas, striving towards his great future. Until now, almost every tennis community in the world recognizes the great name of Xu Chengji.</p>
<p>During his stay in Europe, he defeated many famous players from various countries. The Englishman, Austin, was also defeated by him once.</p>
<p>The Wimbledon tennis tournament this year is about to begin. According to general predictions, the final four this year should be Austin, Menzel, Puncec, and Henkel. In addition, Henkel of Germany, Xu Chengji of China, Betra of France, and Perry, all have considerable hope.</p>
<p>In short, Xu has the possibility of being on the list of the world's top ten players this year.</p>
<p>Recently, according to Shanghai communication, the Dunlop Rubber Company has invited Xu Chengji and Schuerholz to make a world tour, I think this matter can be realized, when Mr. Xu return to the motherland with his skills in the future, he will certainly make a new contribution to us.

<h3 id="e82">From Ancient Greece to the Various Aspects of the Olympic Games <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Lao</p>
<p>— A Very Valuable History of Cultivation —</p>
<p>Second: The participant must have no political or moral stain of any kind. Third: He must have the certification of eight or more judges that he has been practicing for more than ten months and must swear before the gods when he obtains the qualifications to participate in the competition that he will never engage in illegitimate activities. Because of these strict restrictions, all athletes participating in the competition are representatives of the various federations. If they win the competition, they are considered to be incarnations of the gods, not just the glory of themselves and their families. It is simply the glory of a federation. Moreover, they are confident that their peninsula is the center of the world, so the Olympic Games (Olympin Games) are also considered a world affair, called the World Peace Festival. During the festival, it is a sacred truce period. If federations are at war with each other at this time, they will immediately cease military actions due to serving the divine power. Even in places where pirates are rampant on weekdays, merchants who must be vigilant at all times can also travel back and forth with peace of mind without any precautions at this time. Because before the festival, messengers have already been sent to publicize the will of the gods to various federations to prepare for the meeting.</p>
<p>The Reality of the Olympic Games</p>
<p>The only great god of Greece, Zeus, lived in a magnificent temple. Beside the temple were many tombs and altars of lesser gods, as well as marble statues of warriors. The arena was located northeast of the temple. The day of the festival was clearly set to begin one month after the summer solstice. In addition to the athletes, philosophers, poets, orators, historians, and sculptors from various countries gathered at the meeting to display their talents and spread the seeds of civilization. Even merchants exchanged the products of the federations at this time. In 728 BC, there were only short-distance races and other events, which could be completed in one day. After the twenty-seventh battle with the Persian, the reverence for the gods became more enthusiastic, and the number of events also increased, such as boxing, jumping, skill _, long-distance running, chariot racing, walking, horse racing, etc. Later, as the number of events gradually increased, the period was extended to five days. The reality of those five days is as follows: On the first day, a pig was sacrificed to the great god Zeus of Olympia. After the judges' guidance to the athletes and the swearing ceremony before the gods, the Greeks who came to the meeting talked to each other, talking about nothing but the praise of the previous competition results and the speculation of this time results. Many relatives and friends of the athletes held welcome parties and prepared for the support of Ming Jiu. As the east turns white on the second day, the competition begins. The general audience, who had camped out in the arena the night before, had already arranged themselves in order. At this time, the words of encouragement and exhortation from the athletes' parents cannot be described in words. Then, the judges led the athletes into the arena. Only women and slaves were prohibited from watching. Women were only allowed to be in the south of the arena and were not allowed to cross the ALpdcus River to the north. However, there was also a mother who was so eager for her son's victory that she disguised herself as a man and entered the arena, but was later discovered and sentenced to death. Only because the winning son pleaded, was she pardoned. This day was still a competition for teenagers and young people. The second and fourth days were adult competitions. On the fifth day, the award ceremony was held. In the early days, the winners of the competitions were mostly awarded very valuable prizes. Later, because they gained too many rights, they were changed to laurel wreaths made of woven olive branches. But this coarse olive crown was the treasure that the Greek people dreamed of, even to the point where women who were pregnant prayed that their sons could win the laurel wreath. Those who dared to move even one branch of the olive tree in the temple during peacetime were executed. Only the winners of the competition, who were the most beloved by the gods, that is, the incarnations of the gods, could cut down the olive tree with a golden knife to make a crown, and insert a [wood radical] tree, a rolled woolen object, on the crown, and place it on the jade throne in front of the gods. Finally, the judges placed it on the head of the most outstanding winner (Oltympiem), announcing his name and the names of his parents and hometown. The crowd cheered, shaking the heavens and the earth. Their slogans included calling him the darling of the gods, the bravest of the nation, and the model for raising men. A grand honorary banquet was held, orators praised his actions, poets sang of his character, and sculptors sculpted his body. When he returned to his country in glory, riding his own horse, wearing purple clothes, a triumphal meeting was held, a triumphal street was opened, and a triumphal arch was built. Even if the walls of the citizens' houses blocked his horse's path, they would be demolished. He was exempt from taxes for life, received the treatment of an honored guest at banquets, and had free access to all views. In Athens, there was a reward of SllDrad Am l (one equal to four corners in China) and a banquet with foreign envoys. In Sparta, he could be a king's guard and freely choose a beautiful woman as his wife. In short, all the glorious things in the world were concentrated on the winner. Let me give four more examples to show the general glory of the winners.</p>
<p>(1) In 640 AD, Cylou, the 35th competitor, won the girder with 400 meters. But he was not only an athlete but also a schemer. He wanted to seize the political sovereignty of Athens, occupied the city mountain, and fled to the sacred _ of the temple after the defeat to avoid punishment. (Six)</p>
