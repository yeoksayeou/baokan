<p>社評</p>
<h3>汪逆的賣國勾當</h3>
<p>據二十八日中央社所傳津訊，汪逆兆銘確已於二十六日由滬乘飛機經由天津飛抵北平。汪赴平的目的在於與北平漢奸磋商如何組織偽聯邦政府的事宜。據滬訊，事前王克敏曾派人至滬與汪派商量組偽中央政府事，本月中旬羣奸又在滬開會、北平及南京兩偽組織及日外相有田，也皆派代表參加。那末，汪赴平之行似屬可靠，路透社電更傳：『日本人現正在準備「七七」中日戰爭二週年紀念日發表宣言，組織聯邦形式的偽中央政府，羣奸與日閥急於用政治手腕解决中日戰爭，是可以想見的了。</p>
<p>我們觀察各方的情勢，日方所以急忙成立偽中央政府的原因，當不外乎下列幾種：第一，日軍在天津包圍英國，已無形中得到英國某程度的讓步，現在竟將地方性的事件移東京談判了。日本自然不能放過這個機會，趕快造成一個有力而具體的所謂「旣成事實」，以便欺蒙英國現政府當局，討價還價，××××接受日方無理要求。第二，日本軍事當局也已覺悟出單用武力已無法結束中日戰爭，救出泥足愈陷愈深的本身。希特勒在六月初旬即向日本駐德大使大島提出警告：日本侵華戰爭的損失相當鉅大，非有七八年長期的休養，已無法恢復元氣。板垣及其他的陸車首腦。聽到這一消息固然非常懊喪，但是事實依然勝過雄辯。所以卽令軍部也都不能不取消反對利用汪逆的初旨。第三，日方旣重視政治陰謀的作用大於軍事的力量，那末，利用漢奸也要選擇一個帶有欺騙性的人物。汪逆曾為國民黨的重要人物，兼國民政府的要職，在過去中國革命史上也曾佔過一點地位。以汪逆的條件最合於日方的要求。聞日方已答應汪逆幾種堅决的主張：一，設偽中央政府於南京，並平寧兩偽組織為地方政府：二，汪逆所提制定靑天白日五色旗的國徽。這種事實都不是偶然的。</p>
<p>汪逆之登台，沐猴而冠，充傀儡的總罪魁，大槪是不成問題的了。但是汪逆的罪惡却將由這次的排演而信蓗，××××××××××。日前我國民政府已正式嚴令通緝，稱之為「逆」，各方面的聲討也正如飛雪片紛而飛至。汪逆今日不但背叛民國，並且陷害全國人民，除國府明令通緝外，『凡我全國人民對汪之口殊筆伐，亦正宜在此時也』（龍雲主省之言）。××××××××，就不失為中華的民族英雄，千載靑史上當與岳武穆齊名不朽了！</p>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>平地游擊戰爭論</h3>
<p>— 周士梯</p>
<p>已、夜間戰鬥、平地便於夜間活動、夜間活動又可減少×人技術的效能、我們抗戰以來、進行夜間戰鬥很多、並且得到很多勝利、我們要發揚夜戰的經騐、多採取夜間的活動與戰鬥、但夜間活動亦存在有許多弱點、如指揮者不易掌握部隊、易失聯絡、通訊聯絡難以周密、因而不免發生誤會、×人堅守房屋、不易克服、及部隊容易發生恐慌情緒等、這是夜間戰爭要特別注意去克服的、十一月十三日、我××團在滑石片、夜間與×遭遇、我們能迅速的去突擊×人、×人砲兵不能使用、企圖退囘村落據守、但我××團第二營、卽迅速的去佔領村落、×人雖已有一部已進入村落、然在我手榴彈猛擊之下、×人無法佔領、逃走無路、遂被我大部消滅、此次夜戰的經驗是、×情地形都偵察得很淸楚、動作也很迅速堅决、通迅聯絡指揮也好、值得今後學習、</p>
<p>午、平地地形開闊、雖一草一木、小溝低坎、都有很大的價值、在戰鬥中應特別注意利用、並用低姿勢、這是很重要的、</p>
<p>未、平時戰鬥時、要估計×人增援比山地迅速、故戰鬥時的警戒、在主要方面要加强、要能保障主力解决戰鬥，同時、平地交通便利、×繞到我後方顧</p>
<p>較大、故應留出必要的預備隊、（在山地伏擊時、我們往往只注意兩側警戒、不注意後方警戒、亦是不對的）、十一月間、我××團二營在歸綏以北的伏擊、全獲勝利；但×由武川增援、將我在廟子中的警戒排打坍後、繞到第二營後方、斷我歸路、第二營後方毫無警戒、倉卒應付、措手不及、不但勝利品全失、且自已遭到損失、這是一個敎訓、</p>
<p>（丁）偵察</p>
<p>子、在任何時間空間、都應採用一切手段、周密的進行偵察、在平地上更為重要、平地一切地形地物價值增大、地形道路的偵察亦重要、對居民的偵察亦不應放鬆、</p>
<p>丑，平地的偵察手段、與山地一般的大體相同、現在只提出應特別注意的手段與方法、</p>
<p>A、間諜能及早得到×人的消息、此種偵察加强、在各個×人駐地、必須設法派遣、</p>
<p>B、每個部隊、甚至于小的擊游隊都要有自已的偵察者不斷的偵察、幷要注意夜間偵察、否則、如××團在淸滿山時，×人於夜間用汽車載兵接近淸滿山團園，因我們夜間無從察，到拂曉×開始進攻時才知道，而受到一點損失。</p>
<p>C，各部隊除主力部隊派出偵察外、各警戒部隊（如前哨，連哨，小哨，）都嬰自己派出偵察組，或警戒地區前面主要方向五六里至十餘里處，不斷進行偵察，以便及早了解情况，這是很要緊的，特別是夜間。</p>
<p>D，在行動地區內，要建立嚴密的偵察網，把我們的偵察　延伸到×人駐地及其附近，使×人一舉一動，我們都得及時知道，</p>
<p>担任偵察綱的人員，主要的是各市鎭村莊裏忠誠於抗戰事業的份子，有時部隊亦可派人去担任、不論何種成分負責領導偵察的部隊，要該偵察網的人員，予以必要的偵察敎育、要經常派人去指導及檢查、</p>
<p>担任偵察的網人員，除本身進行偵察外，要利用可靠的羣衆帮助偵察、</p>
<p>E、平地、特別是接近×人的地區、×人的偵察部隊及人探、亦是經常活動的、故偵察的僞裝、亦重要、如第口支隊　偵察員，甚至於他們　工人員、在陽曲、靖源、文水、等平地交城、中工作，是多穿便衣、混于衆羣中、有時亦帶×人發給的良民證，故周圍雖是×人，或有遇到×人、都無危險、</p>
<p>F、除了部隊自己派遣　偵察之外、要發動人民自動的將×情報吿我們，如□□團，去年十一月間在白家莊時，×人三路來攻經過三路的村莊，羣衆都自動來報告，使我××團得以從容佈置、又如最近××團在雁門以東的一個連、派一個通訊員送信，行至老窠時，適遇七個×人到該村搜索，羣衆知道該通訊員是我××軍人員，馬上報告，並帶該通訊員到山上躱避，這些例子是很多的，故偵察工作，依靠居民的力量，是異常軍要的部份。</p>
<p>（戊）警戒</p>
<p>不論部隊大小，和靜止或活動，而警戒則都要比山地加强與確實，才能保障主力安全，不遭受×的襲擊，而能從容應付</p>
<p>（已）通訊聯絡</p>
<p>平地行軍作戰，隊形是比山地寬大和疏散，同時因為防空關係，宿營地有時亦會採取分散於較大地區，偵察警戒派遣較多，所以需要有較周密的確實的通訊聯絡，通訊聯絡的原則，與山地沒有什麼不同，除盡量使用我們所有的通訊工具外，須注意如下事項：</p>
<p>子，平地通訊容易，旗語，記號，須多使用？</p>
<p>丑，加强騎兵通訊。</p>
<p>寅，建立脚踏車通訊？</p>
<p>卯，在羣衆中建立通訊，或利用地方政權機關，特別是通訊工具少的部隊：但為要確實與迅速，仍須盡量使用自己的通訊工具為好（利用政權機關，及羣衆通訊網，只限於自己的通訊工具不够和某些不重要不緊急的事情）。</p>
<p>（庚）　對付××的襲擊</p>
<p>×人襲擊的戰術，現在比過去，確是有了進步。在前冬與春間，×人對我軍襲擊，還是沒有突然性，按照正規的作戰方式，「接近展開，火力準備，衝鋒。」如去年十一月十二月間襲擊白莊與楊家井等處的××團部隊。但到年四五月後是進步了，多採取夜間行，在拂曉前將我駐地包圍，截斷我軍路、不放槍、繞過我們警戒綫，突然施衝鋒，使我措手不及。如四月間襲擊心坪之我××獨立營，六月間襲擊趙家窑之我××團第二營等等，有時亦採用預先埋伏於我軍經常往來的道傍，施行突然突擊，如六七月以後，朔縣×經常派出數十人在朔縣以西以南村莊樹林中，襲擊我游擊隊，和捕捉我工作人員，又如十一月間，我××團第五連，在克畢齊以南平壩中，解决一部偽軍，獲軍馬四五十匹，勝和囘到畢克齊以北之四道河子附近，因為沒有注意偵察警戒，致所受勝利全受損失，抗戰以來，我各部總計被×襲擊二十餘次，有些是×人失敗了，有些是×人成功了，檢查起來，×人襲擊成功的主要原因，還不是×人的藝擊技術有很大進步，而是我們對×人的戰術了解不够，對×情估計錯誤，驚覺性差，不注意偵察警戒的綠故。</p>
<p>根據×一〇九師團山口旅團長頒發的『戰場敎育材料』第五條說：『對於採取游擊戰術的×人，要想收到很大的效果，除了用奇襲方法以外，沒有別的法子。因此利用夜間機動的小隊部、勇敢放胆的作戰，值得特別獎勵，同時需要保守秘密，注意僞兩。』事實也是如此，如×一〇九師團川畸聯隊蛟野大隊，十一月二日夜八時由五台出發，走六十里山路，去襲擊洪口鎭我邊區第□大隊，襲擊後於三日晚又夜行軍囘五台，（附記：三日夜該×囘到滑石片附近，被我某團游擊，消滅其大部）、</p>
<p>×人對我軍的襲擊，是積極的，並且×人認為是『除了奇襲的方法之外，沒有別的法子了』可見×人的襲擊動作、是對抗游擊部隊的主要戰術，×人在山地中區經常對我强行，而在平地上，×人襲擊我軍的行動必然增加，固然在平地的兵或游擊隊，都要深刻的注意我研究對付×人的　擊，現在將對付×人　擊的方法原則分述如下，（未完）</p>

<h3>洞庭湖　×軍絕難渡過湘省丰收可期</h3>
<p>— 淮水</p>
<p>為什麽岳陽淪陷後的湘北戰局、卽告沉寂呢？據我們的判斷，認為是這樣：以岳陽為根據地的×人，深恐湘北叢山峻嶺河流湖沼所組成的複雜地形，和鐵路公路等交通線的澈底破壞，他們會失掉他所持以戰勝的坦克軍重砲的擁護，所以不能不暫時停止南犯，曾經有人估計過，當洞底湖春水漲滿的時候，很可能×人要以海軍為主溯江而上、以側擊我沿江部隊。</p>
<p>在南昌失守後，武昌到岳陽列軍特別忙、×人會有集三個師團兵力於湘北南犯的揚言、洞庭湖是岸的岳　城陵磯也舶了許多×艦，但據我方的情報，和淪階區內逃出的民衆說，所謂「增援」多半兵力的來往調動了。</p>
<p>據一個有二十年航行洞庭湖經驗的老水手告訴記者，×艦活動的可能性是很少的。</p>
<p>第一，洞庭湖的水漲得快，但同時也落得快。</p>
<p>第二，水大了，湖中許多沙灘那被淹沒，到處是一片汪洋，那處深，那處淺，就是終年航行洞庭湖上的人，也沒有這個把握。</p>
<p>洞庭湖畔　港縱橫，水道繁多，航行一定要　幟以批示水道，現在這些　幟完全被我破壞，×艦活動自然　難，何況×人惟一能用的就是小汽艇，曾有幾次有四五十隻以上的小汽艇編隊在十幾架飛機的掩護下，企圖於四角，九馬嘴，八仙淵等三地登陸，原來這三地均位於湘江口岸，是仲入湖心的半島上的三個頂點，若果能登陸成功，則可腰擊我新牆河突出部隊，幷可溯湘江而上，但是×人幾次試探都沒有成事，堅守洞庭潮的××師，有着五個繼續加强的工功，和相當合理的配備，×人每次來犯總有幾隻×艦被擊沉。</p>
<p>我們現在已開始學會爭取主動出擊了，所以洞庭湖邊，最近頻傳捷報！</p>
<p>由於×人兵力不够分配，我軍派出大批游擊隊，來往×後，見機突擊，使×措手不及，損傷極重；而不得不將兵力集中於少數重要據點以圖株守、最近我電在新牆河北迭獲勝利、某部且已繞山臨湘一帶活動，×人到處受牽掣，更談不到橫越洞庭，</p>
<p>「湖廣熟，天下足」，堅守洞庭湖的，結果，我們預期着湖南偉大的豐收！</p>
<h3>從寶雞到漢中（一）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>一·公路和棧道的險奇</p>
<p>從寶雞南下漢中、或直入四川、因登記候車者甚多、故車票不易購獲到手，旅館求過于供、僅一七炕，毫無臥具、至少亦漲價八角以上，商人諸如此類大發國難財，未免太不近于情理。旅客候車日久，因食宿消耗關係，牀頭金盡，馴至無法啓程者有之。然塞翁失馬、安知非福、那裏是個新興都市，各業正當用人之際、走不了便找工作做，有時比買票還要容易些，有兩個學產科的女生，就在這樣買不到票的情形下，同時還看見個孕婦，當街生了孩子無住處；是他他　靈機一轉，向縣長借點資本，創設了一個產科醫院，不到半年，居然營業蒸蒸日上、流浪女一變而為名聖手了。</p>
<p>記者因承友人帮忙、第三日即得提早啟行，那天一同行的客車和軍車（運殘廢傷兵）、多至三四十輛、絡繹十數里，聲勢極為雄壯，初離宣城，旋曲渡渭河，迤邐入山，即盤旋仰登秦嶺（古大散關）；其山勢之雄峻，路綫之　折，既能動心驚魄、亦可醒腦悅目，旣而登峯造國，又復　轉下降，山陰山陽，均各有高唱着謌聲的溪流相伴，溪流淸　，毫無渭水濁色；山林蒼翠，雅似南國風光——有謂陝南非應西北地，似有其截然不同的地理根據。</p>
<p>汽車所經公路，多利用古棧道而修築，棧道由實鷄進至褒城、為連雲棧，亦稱北棧；由褒城再南進，經寧　而入四川　元，昭化，劍州，則爲南棧，南北兩棧，均在崇山峻嶺間，古代具簡陋，修築當極感　難，讀諸　武候與兄瑾書：「前趙子龍退軍，燒壞赤崖以北閣道緣谷一百餘里：其閣梁一頭人山腹，一頭立柱子于水中，今水大而急，不可定柱」云云。卽可想而知，然武候行兵所由斜谷（在　縣，百武候沿　城『今城固』，較褒谷趨長安尚捷二百數十里），棧橋閣道，卽多至五千數百所，若再將所有南北棧道統計在內，其工稈的偉大意義，恐不在今日川陝公路之下，</p>
<p>今日川陝公路築成，汽車往來奔馳，固較棧道駛用木牛流馬，便捷幾十幾百倍、可是路綫長達數千　，所經又多深山險阱，忽而高上靑雲，忽而低下入幽谷，所謂「一夫當關，萬夫莫過」的要隘，眞是層出不窮，更業難數、若以現代攻守戰術來說：一旦坡道破壞，橋樑折斷，則攻者須長　跋涉，自難利用重兵器，而守者層層據　以抗，儘量發揮各種新兵器效能，其必操勝算，可不待證而知了。汪精衛叛國降敵，貿然向敵獻媚：進犯漢中，威脅四川啊！他顯然不懂川漢地理特性，何異痴人大談夢囈啊！</p>
<p>行行重行行，駛下秦嶺，走了一段狹長而較平坦的壩子（北方叫川　），那就是鳳縣，留壩之間，又要高攀風嶺之上，已而白雲摩　，尚須更上一層，肉顫心悸地通柴關嶺——沿路風景，險奇已極，尤其行抵高崗，前　後廟，看那數十輛蜿艇面上，曲折而下的汽車，恰像一隻隻互相追逐着的灰蝶，在幽美的翠林桃溪中，活潑潑地穿來穿去。</p>
<p>嶺下有小鎭，名廟台子，建有『漢張桓侯廟』，傳內部兼供留侯相，故亦稱留侯祠。祠西山峯，有子房辟穀處（秦嶺附另有張良廟），松柏古茂，林壑尤為美函。</p>
<p>此去公路兩旁，均係萬仞高崗，中有一河，車緣其岸，委婉前進，河水愈流愈急，視線愈走愈狹，時間不過下午三四時，陽光己水被山遮不見，</p>
<p>前望有一高峯，山勢更為陡峻，其形略如鷄頭，那就是古戰地鷄頭關（古稱七盤嶺）。嶺上亂　嵯峨，登者如上雲梯，棧道在右岸鑒石門以通行。公路則過橋走左岸、亦須另鏧石洞而穿過，前述北棧路線，己止于此；蕭何所焚棧道，亦指此線而言，楚漢相爭時，高帝曾被霸王圍　于雞頭關，關上現有士地廟一所，傳卽　奉當時送給高帝水喝之老人，又石壁尚鐫有「石門十三種古帖」，中有曹操手筆，素為藝林所著稱，</p>
<p>出關忽豁然開朗，全是一望無涯的麥地，四周雖亦隱隱見山，但已遠在百數十里之外，這，就是賣國賊韓復渠，汪精衛們所念念不忘的漢中區了，不過此間向非南鄭（卽漢中）縣地界，而是褒城縣轄境，同我們一道流出口來的那條河，叫褒城河，或紫金河，或黑龍江，南流與漢江交匯，東出襄樊，又名襄河，再與長江合流於漢口，</p>
<p>褒城卽在關口右岸（卽褒城河西岸）雉碟民房，以及新興工廠建設，均歷歷在望，該縣正在要道建立抗日陣亡將十紀念塔，其前豎一木牌坊，車從下面通過，仰視有宇曰：「倭寇不消滅，勇士羞人此門！」及過而囘顧，又曰：「此乃抗日英雄前進的大道！「這個很有勉勵警惕的意義，尤其從北上殺賊的英勇將士看來。　（未完）</p>

<h3>哈立法克斯演說　英法抵抗侵略　德武力主張實自孤之道望英蘇談判早成功　英決接受蘇聯要救</h3>
<p>【中央社倫敦廿九日電】英政府業已决定、接受莫斯科一切要求、據海通社自此間外交界消息靈通人士探悉、英政府對莫斯科談判前途之信任、係基于下述實事、卽最後向西慈大使及史德隆專使所發訓令、幾已表示全部接受蘇聯要求、英、法兩國現已準備將曾經明白表示拒絕之波羅的海各國國名、及其他中立國家、列入保障同盟條約、聞在此種中立國家有盧森堡在、此為法國所要求列入者、關於波羅的海各國、現僅有一點、猶未解决、此卽各該國之一如因內政變遷、而改變其對鄰邦之關係時、究將如何、但倫敦方面對此種困難、幷不十分重視、因西慈大使業已接獲訓令、有充分權力、適應蘇方要求、卽使此項要求超出最後建議範圍以外、祇要同盟能可迅告成立、亦可照辦云、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦廿九日電】外相哈立法克斯（見圖）今日在英皇家協會演說、其言曰：「如再有侵略之事件發生、吾人决以全力履行吾人抵抗之　言、有某種國家之人民、以其另抱一種國際竹學、乃不惜顛倒是非誤傳吾人之行為及動機、吾人得悉之下、知其不確、更悉造謠者亦目知其非確、故殊覺可鄙、凡此種種奧夫</p>
<p>邦人受辱之事實、此間均深予注意、英國永不為謠言或武力所屈服、今者世風日下、人心不古、故不少令人驚異之事件發生、吾人之目的旣遞</p>
<p>言中傷、似應毅然冉作明朗之申述、吾人初步决心在求限制侵略、職是之故、吾人遂與他國聯結共同應付此普通之危機、此種措施之唯一目的在於自衛但不幸竟被視為孤立政策及有意包圍德意而妨害其尋求生存之空間、然而事實安在？乃德國者、誠可謂自動孤立成功矣、從經濟方面言、其政策為獨佔主義、政治方面、其政策更引起全世界之不安、從文化言、其政策為種族主義、是皆自行孤立之道、德既竭力自孤、又豈能歸咎於別人？至若德意謂吾人絕其尋求「生存空間」一節、尤覺莫明其妙蓋</p>
<p>強佔土地絕非所以解决「生存空間」之道、而必須修明內政、敦睦邦交、庶乎近之、但吾人所不得不注意者、當德國提出此項要求之際、其本國則正歡迎外國移民、羅致大量捷、荷、意籟工人以應其工業及農業之需要、然則德國何所據而謂人口過剩、實際上如比利時、荷蘭及英倫三島、始可謂為人口過剩、但吾人仍能以生產工作解决此項問題、從經濟上言、世界各國之關係有如梭織、極為密切、故任何一國、均不能企圖損害鄰邦而利一己、若由合作途徑進行、則滿足各國經濟生命之機會正多、而所謂「生存空間」亦可頓此以解决、如世界依此組織、則德意亦將不必因其自身之安全而恐懼、惟靡有能以武力建立國際社會者、在其生存當中一面恐他人之暴力、而以其一切財源、用諸</p>
<p>防禦之道、無和平可言、而作和平呼籲、誠虛言耳、除非實行裁軍以為保證、及確實承認他國有享受其自由之權、不能故作解决之態、時至今日、武力主義、已將解决之途加以閉塞、全世界充滿嫉妒仇恨、惡意、苛刻之氣氛、如武力主張、一旦能加以廢除、使世界對戰爭之恐怖、不復存在、則所有未能解决之問題、亦將迎刃而解、此時各國便可開誠公布、討論政治、經濟之困難問題、不論其係具有國際性質或殖民地問題、惟如某一國家政府、其負責之發言人終日指其友邦為盜賊、或奸謀者、對英國世界政策、加以中傷、則英國勢難與之舉行談判、英政府之致力、厥在使各國囘復自信、第二步則在重建</p>
<p>國際秩序、使其臻於更廣闊更堅定之基礎」、哈立法克斯論及國際聯盟及其盟約後、謂「除非有一機構、其功能足以做成和平轉雙、否則僅尋求阻止以武力更改現狀之辦法、亦屬不足、吾人之外交政策、除應付目前之事變外、尚及於將來、英國政策、有兩大基本原則、一為决心抵抗武力、一為　識世界之意向、進行建設工作、建立和平、在今日戰雲瀰漫之秋、英國之最直接任務、仍在抵抗侵略、吾願對此加以鄭重聲明、俾不致為他人所誤會、如吾人能破除誤會、獲得解决辦法、不能徒作空言、而必須以具體事實使全世界加以置信、不論予取、雙方必須以具體行動出之、而不能徒以空言之保證、換得實質之獲取也」、在哈立法克斯未發表上述演說前、曾論及與波蘭、士耳其、希臘、及羅馬尼亞成立之協定、幷表示希望</p>
<p>英蘇談判能早日完成哈立法克斯演詞結語謂、「吾人担負波蘭土耳其、希臘及羅馬尼亞之義務、絕對獲致相互之諒解、吾人深知若他國喪失安全與獨立、則英國之安全與獨立亦將遭受嚴重之威脅也、吾人之擴軍準備、日漸進展、無論在政治、行政與工業各方面、足以證明政府此種努力實獲得全國人民公意之擁護也、如國際公法與世界秩序、必應加以維護、則吾人必須準備為</p>

<h3>日×新戰略</h3>
<p>據桂林電稱，日×侵華新戰略如下：（一）對晉陝主攻，（二）對鄂中助攻，（三）對湘贛佯攻，（四）對華南用海軍游攻，（五）對晉南蘇北繼續掃蕩，（六）對華中游擊隊限期「肅淸」，（七）限七月初佔浙東，這樣料×，自有其相當根據，但我們對於×人今後侵掠戰略，還應有如下的基本認識：</p>
<p>（一）目前××作戰，主要的是配合政治的經濟的進攻，重心放在佔領區統治的鞏固，以便用我人力物力財力來養大日軍征服中國。</p>
<p>（二）×對晉陝，可能採取主攻形勢，但目的還是鞏固佔領區，掃蕩游擊隊及其根據地；因此我們要認淸，如晉陝危急，則全局牽動，而日來西綫苦戰奇捷，實為西南獲得安定的主因。</p>
<p>（三）×人兵力，現益分散，益感不足，袛藉其部隊之機動性而能跳躍作戰，一面故意養成我們對西南的『安全』感，鬆解我們抗戰的積極情緒，變持久戰為拖戰，一面則鞏固及擴展佔領區，養軍以準備『一鼓征服全華』！</p>
<p>（四）因此，我們今日必須嚴重警備、遵從蔣委員長的昭示，力爭主動，全面抗戰，只有主動的全面的持久戰，才能打破×人一切新的花樣新的陰謀！</p>

<h3>世界獵奇　猩猩兒子</h3>
<p>在巴黎，一位著名的獸醫，梅乃德醫生，公佈了一椿關於心理敎育上，空前未有的實驗：</p>
<p>十年前，梅醫生到中菲探險的時候，在叢林里，捕到一頭才滿兩歲的小猩猩；他將它帶囘家中，替他起個名宇，叫「法涌」。，梅醫生，和他的太太，還有兩個兒子，盡力地使『法通』忘　它原來是獸類，這就是說，他們對待它，一切與人無異，讓它長大起來，但是，却沒有正式敎導和訓練過它，完全由一種自然規例的發展，使它由獸的生活，踏入人的社會。</p>
<p>「法通」第一次與大衆會面。是在最近梅醫生所舉行的一次大宴會中，他在家裏宴請許多著名心理學家，著名醫生，和新聞記者，當大家坐定之後，餐室的門開了，「法通」穿着整齊的衣服，跟人一樣，用後腿走進房間來，順手將門關好，然後，等中人爲他介紹。他很有禮貌地和來賓逐一握手，不過，面部則沒有半點表情。之後，他找到桌子盡頭的末一個坐位，坐下了。他吃着他的一份菜不曾弄出絲亳錯誤。分配給他的一份晚餐，和別人的完全一樣，有湯，有魚，有肉，還有蔬菜，和甜點心，他十分鎮靜地，由隣座手上接過菜肴來，自己取了一點，再轉遞給別入，吃着，也能吃得亁乾凈凈，吃飯時，惟一的異樣就只是他拿的蔬菜和菓子，是比別人特別食多一點，他很像樣地執着酒杯，暍着酒，倒並不一口就倒下肚，也是客客氣氣地，隔一會兒，才呷一口。在上點心的時候，他忽然起身，走到梅太太跟前，用兩臂親熱地在她肩上，淸晰的喚着，『媽媽，媽媽！』然後，他撒嬌的指著一瓶白葡萄酒，因爲，他認得出　上貼的簽條，這正是他最愛喝的，他要討一杯。在喝咖啡的當口，梅醫生說，「我們該抽抽烟啦。」并沒有叫他，「法通」嫻熱地走過去，打開一扇壁櫥，拿出一盒雪茄，再拿出幾種香煙，逐一分送給賓客們，一個個都替他們點上火，不曾忘掉了誰。最後，他自己也燃上一支杳煙。帶着一個煙灰盤，怡然自得地坐下抽煙。抽完，將　尾放在盤裏壓熄了、</p>
<p>這猩猩，穿着一件很舒適的新襯衫，淺色的褲子，足登帆布鞋。他自己有一間睡房，裏頭有一張桌子，一張搖椅，一張床，一個衣櫃，還有一個特設的磁磚浴盆，他自己旋開龍頭放水，試過凉熱，方下水洗面冉是自己擦乾，穿上衣服，總之，和人一樣，他目由自在的，滿屋子奔走，倒也不碰壞甚麼東西，不得允許，他不溜進食物備藏室。梅醫生不和他說甚麽的轉候，他也老老實實，不聲不響，全不像其他獸類，有那一股浮煉勁。</p>
<p>飯後，梅醫生將他這番實驗，解釋給來賓們聽，特別聲明：『法通』幷沒有在馬戲班受過猩猩的訓練，每一件事，是這猩猩做的，都留下記錄，全家人，從來沒有特別訓練他做過什麼事，十年來，他長大成『人』，所受到的指導，和兩個兒子都是一樣，平等待遇；他出於自動的，要學習開門，開箱子，撥電燈機紐，用刀，又，匙吃飯。然而，『法通』只會說一句話，『媽媽！」這也是跟兩個孩子嘴裏學來。由此，梅醫生斷定、『媽媽』這兩個字，是人類最基本的語言，世界任何種語言，都是如此，這是一個猩猩最容易的發音，因爲，這是只要嘴啓開合兩次，就自然能聽到的聲音。</p>
<p>你覺得這奇怪嗎？幾千年獸變人的歴史，能够在十年之內完成。</p>
<h3>鬼</h3>
<p>李老太太十分怕鬼，一天，她候親戚家去，晚上，被招待到一間離得很遠，很淸靜的房間去歇宿，李老太太等人們都定後，連忙將窗戶關緊，門也閂好，却聽見床上有聲音說：李太太！不要害怕，現在房裏只有我們兩個了</p>
<h3>珍聞</h3>
<p>西藏只出版一種報紙，編者是一個基督新敎的傳敎士，名叫阿士波。不久以前，阿士波由西藏往歐洲，對新聞記者說，他在一個離海面一萬尺高的小村落中，辦邇種西藏僅有的報紙，編輯，印刷，及發行等工作，完全由他單獨担任，印報機是一架手用的小印刷機，每次只印五十份，訂戶均係當地喇嘛，因爲西藏只有喇嘛才認得字，可是喇嘛一接到報紙，便馬上集合居民，講解報上的新聞，因此，這種報紙雖僅行銷五十份，可是『讀者』却有十餘萬呢。</p>

<p>現在且談談這把傘的身世吧！它的傘布是黑綢，柄是棕色的，鑲着一段金色的箍兒。重量一磅又半；價目，是五十七先令六便士，不算便宜，</p>
<p>這把傘雖然在偷效詹姆斯宮附近的白理吉商店賣出，它的製造，却是在一家不甚聞名的小工廠里，工人是四男兩女，傘上，每一針，都是手縫的，每一紐子那是手訂約。</p>
<p>這把傘，雖然常常拿去修理，但，實在一次也不曾張開用過。也許是長途跋涉太多，剝蝕了。現在一把傘的影子。又到了遠東了；大案且看着吧！</p>
<h3>海上風雲勞頓</h3>
<p>— 上尉著著楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述一九一四年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，趁穗輪「凱柏隆齊號」去遊歷歐洲，在船上接着消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來裁刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來。不久，又遇到冰山，和英艦的炮擊，好容易地逃出虎口，囘到美境白海。傑克與比爾便囘紐約去，見到邱克斯先生。邱又叫他們趁「聖烏克號」去歐洲找他的兒子。</p>
<p>「請你儘快將這個發出去。」他說著，將信交給傑克。</p>
<p>當他的眼睛望到這青年收發員時，他露出一種似曾相識的神氣，但是，那兩個靑年全沒有留神。此爾對於這事漠不關心，傑克却皺緊周頭在看着那封信件。這是用密碼的，寄到紐約一個所在，簽名是馬丁强生。</p>
<p>「很對不起，强生先生，」傑克說，一我們不能代發這封函件。」</p>
<p>『不能？爲甚麼不能？』那位旅客發怒了。</p>
<p>『因爲這是密碼。』</p>
<p>「這又有什麼關係？」</p>
<p>『我們有過命令，在戰事中，不能代發密碼的電信，不是用英文直接寫得明明白白，是不能發的。』</p>
<p>『這真正荒謬，』他更不高興了，『我吿訴你，這是一封商業上的信件。』</p>
<p>『若是你能用英文淸楚寫出來，我就可以轉發了。』傑克說。</p>
<p>那人忽然俯向前，他一隻手揮進袋裏，隨卽拿出一捲紙。</p>
<p>『我能和你秘密談兩句嗎？』他問着，眼光轉射着比雨南諸。</p>
<p>「無論甚麽活，你都可以當我朋友的面講出來。」傑克說。</p>
<p>「那末，看這兒——這捲里頭是一百塊錢，」他將它擲在書桌上，「只要你暫時忘掉一下守密碼的規助，這就屬你了。」</p>
<p>「看着，强生先生，」傑克洽然的說，「我已經吿訴過你，我們的命令。要說你的錢罷，卽使那是一百萬，對於我，也還是這麼回事。」</p>
<p>「哼！你是個蠢豬，」那人怒髮衝冠的抓起那捲　，將信件在手中圖皺，街出艙去了。</p>
<p>「又是那個惡小子，」當他走到甲板上時，他嘰咕着，「這也只是讓我再計他一次帳，這些美國像伙，都是蠢豬。好罷，若是我不能在無線電室想辦法，大不了，馮克登在紐約得不到報吿就是了。」</p>
<p>「喂，」傑克等那黑鬍鬚人走出去之後，比爾問，「你想得出這人是誰嗎？」</p>
<p>「誰，强生？」傑克懶洋洋的，「怎麼，對的。你現在理會到，在他的聲音和眼神裏是有一點兒熟悉，可是，在我的一生中，我不要認識他。」</p>
<p>「我也不要，可是，我總覺得，以前我遇見過他。」</p>
<p>「叫强生的人是多得像爛楬梅。」</p>
<p>「哈！我們眞運氣，自印度找到了這個像皮人！」</p>

<p>奧斯丁（英）與前捷克選手杜老尼亦有劇烈掙扎、奧氏以七比五、九比七連勝一二盆、嗣後、杜老尼以前日之戰時部受傷、不能再行繼續比賽、乃自行官吿棄權、</p>
<p>柯基（美）勝勞傑斯（愛爾蘭）未見費力、比數爲七比五、六比一、六比四、</p>

<h3>馬來亞僑胞暫停全運</h3>
<p>— 千里</p>
<p>當香港各華人球隊，正紛紛派遣勁旅遠征國外的當兒，而怡保教華僑、却因鑒於國難的嚴重，擬將原定在怡保舉行的第五屆全馬來亞華人運動會的舉辦費二萬元，撥捐做救濟祖國和乓災，同時幷將在建築中的霹靂大運動場工稈暫行停止。這實是很值得吾人注意的一件事情。</p>
<p>僑胞的愛好運動，比之國內同胞一向有加無减，那是誰都不能否認的事實。可是當此國家危急之際，他們竟能捨棄所好，將有用的金錢、撥囘祖國救濟兵災，而我們却千萬百計拿那應用於抗戰及救災的金錢，去出席奧林匹克，這不是一個很好的對照麼？</p>
<p>不錯，體育對於新中國的靑年，巳給予極大的裨益，但我們要問，是不是派了十幾二十選手出國，就算達到了振興體育的目的？或者藉此以表示我國國力富有，不若×人那樣可憐，連世運都無力去赴呢？或者藉此表示中國體育人才的優秀「揚威國外」嗎？但不幸得很，中國一向派到世運或台杯的選手，總是吃鴨蛋的，而中國最强的幾個足球隊，竟也連敗於被歐洲方面所看不起南圻甲之手，這樣看起來「揚威國外」似乎只是夢想。</p>
<p>那麼，爲甚麽？表現國力富有麼？但我想，就書如所謂黃金國吧，當其國家有事之狄，亦未必會玩這個玩意兒。當歐戰的期間內，有誰個參戰國家去參加國際比賽呢？就在歐戰以後，德俄等國不是有好多年不參加國際競技麽？他們這樣做，是不是就是表示他們國家的貧困？不，决不，反過來說，正是表示他們的實際和苦幹精神，而不像我們的粉飾和渾噩癡況，所以戰敗的德國以及亂後的俄國。到了今天，遂在世界上有舉足輕重之勢，實不是偶然的。</p>
<p>中國自抗戰以來快要兩年了，在這兩年的過程中，人口的損失，財產的燬　，土地的陷落，實爲歷史上希有的慘切，在這國破家亡，整千整萬的人民輾轉溝　之際，而說我們還有餘力去參加那種紛飾昇平的國　　技，不是天大笑話嗎？　　相信外國人士會因中國——席世運，而就贊稱中國　　的富有，反之，說不定　的許要被外人竊笑是愚痴的。而日敵的不派隊參加，想來也未必就有人會譏笑其「國力的不濟一吧。因爲誰部曉得，中日兩國此刻正在各盡全力作國命的鬥爭呀。</p>
<p>誠然，派遣十數二十個選手赴世遷，未必需要得太的所費。行之，卡必就　喪了國力；不行，也未必就得挽囘刦難。但問題似不在這裏，而在表現的精神。參加世運的費用固然未必很表，但怡保僑胞所留節下來的二萬元難道是很大嗎？不過無論如何，這些錢總可以救回許多傷兵及救活許多難　了吧。</p>
<p>爲甚麼怡保的僑胞能够想到這層，而對於國內的慘況，耳目較近，或身受目擊的國內及香港同胞，反漠然置之，這是甚麼緣故呢？是神經麻木了嗎？抑或是腐氣太深無從自拔？或者是大國民的風度，本就是如此的嗎？</p>
<p>在這國破家亡之際，竟有這樣閒情逸致，派遺球隊南遊遠征，派遣選手出席世運。這遂使我恍然領悟於爲甚麼當美國華僑出死力爭，阻止美國工人將舊銅爛鐵搬日船之際，而本港的同胞却大規模的將內地的廢銅售鐵掃買運上×輪，而毫不躇躊；當各地僑胞正風起雲踴，甚至於歐美人士亦在實行杯葛日貨的時候，而本港的×貨——如布匹玩具等等——却充塞於本港國人商店的櫃櫉里；而且本港雖現爲中國顯官　富的聚集的場所，可是直到現在連預定銷售的一千萬元救國公僓亦距滿額相差尙遠的道理了。</p>
<p>想起來，雖說住在香港的國人亦一樣稱爲「僑胞」，但究竟距離　國太近了，那積年沿習的大陸的腐風，遂也不免吹染在港僑的心神上，而生出了麻木的，醉生夢死的氣息。看吧，娛樂場上的鬥艷爭奇，酒樓茶室的熱鬧歡叫，那不正是和祖國的烽火連天，殘肢斷足相對照嗎？</p>
<p>祖國的腐風，也許巳因×人的炸彈及火藥氣味不斷的熏灼而凈除了那原來藏納的腐質。　　　　　　　　為　　土</p>
<h3>饑餓與鬥爭</h3>
<p>— 布克</p>
<p>人類被饑餓的威脋太甚了。要來一次痛痛快快的大變革，改變這殘酷的世界！</p>
<p>處在這些動亂的時日裏，磯餓的大衆巳逐漸在苦難的烘爐底下孕育出來，壯大起來！產生着不可征服的力量！</p>
<p>中國是一個餓餓難民特衆的國度，這是大衆正給予中國空前未有的雄大的反帝力量，這力量施用到令日驅逐　　，撲滅漢奸的鬥爭上來，尤其是施用於建設新的民主的中國，這無疑的是一群偉大而不可征服的生力軍！</p>
<p>「饑餓就是力量」（郭沫若）這一力量將成爲國際反侵略的支柱；成爲世界反法西斯鬥爭的保壘！</p>
<p>我們中國，因爲為苦的人家佔了絕大多敎，這也是由於　　給以我們許多窮苦的災難，這災難恰好成了我們爲民族生存而爭鬥的主要因素，目前餓餓的人羣不僅沒有在餓餓中國轉，向滅亡中淪陷，反而英勇地參加着這抗日救國的鬥爭。鬥爭正是爭取中國人民解放的唯一出路，我們要動員和武裝這廣大的群衆努力抗戰的工作。</p>
<p>人世問沒有因爲磯餓而逃避鬥爭工作的史貝；更沒有因爲饑餓而對侵略者讓步和投降！反正因爲餓餓而掀起了不可抑制的革命動員！</p>
<p>中國受了這樣慘酷的遭刦，廣大的人民盡在饑餓的苦海裏，增加了對生存的愛慕，爲維護祖國的生命，予侵略者以强烈的反抗，掀起了救亡的巨浪，餓着肚皮不要緊，幹救亡去！</p>
<p>要解决自己和大家的餓，我們應該從救亡的巨浪中把自己的民族整個地打救起來！</p>
<p>饑餓雖是一個急切的問題，但拯救民埃的危機正是補救饑餓的第一條路！</p>
<p>抗戰就是爭取中國人民自由生活建設的途徑，中國人民要在抗戰中打倒侵略與獲得獨立生存與自由的權利！</p>
<h3>僕向了祖國</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>靜聞從家口那裏有趣地指點著，她的舉動，有時候比她的年齡要幼小得多，靑芷却不屑地睡到自己的床上，不再去理　她。她的心中總在想着在許那個檢疫人發覺自己錯悮，會應許他們都立刻上岸。</p>
<p>她的幻想終於沒有實現，一直到天黑下來的時候，他們這些人還留在船上。有些人是會排遣時間的，廳堂裏集了一些商人在賭博，在喝酒；還有一些跑碼頭的生意人，已經打扮起來，等候攫取她們第一次的勝利品。她們走到船板上去，望著一片靜息的海水，幾盞漁家的燈火，徵微地幌搖着。可是當她們走到另一面來，却看到使人訝異的景物，各色的燈，點綴滿了那座山城，海水更留下燦爛的投影，彎彎曲曲地，好像一直垂到水底。一隻船過去了，把那金花花的影子都攪亂了，可是不久又都恢復它的舊觀。夜，正好把這個城的醜惡掩蓋住了，却由于萬家的燈火把它裝點得十分美麗。</p>
<p>『你不喜歡，道個城麼？』</p>
<p>『我不會喜歡的，因爲它不是我們的』、</p>
<p>她真是不曾喜歡這個城，只有三天的勾留，她更厭惡這個城了。</p>
<p>她總記得那一句話，當她們纔走到岸上，一個來接她們的朋友就半玩笑地向她們說：</p>
<p>『在這裏走路可要當心呵，被汽車撞死只賠五十元，如果你在路上吐一口痰，也要罰五十元，人的價格和一口痰是相等的』。</p>
<p>由於她的觀察，甚至於覺得一個人還不及一口痰。她曾經看見路旁的一個小販，被一個巡捕把他的貨物都踢到地上，當那個小販去搶的時節，也被踢倒在地上，他不是一塊石頭，所只他不會使那個巡捕的脚感到疼痛；他只無用地倒在地上，呻吟着，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　活　　　　　　　　　看見過和這相同的場面；可是她從來沒有看見過像這樣兇惡的巡捕，也沒有看見過像這樣連一口大氣也不敢喘的人。</p>
<p>可是這裏，自從上海陷落之後，來了許許多多的人。除開大半的過路者，也來了一大羣富有的寓公。砭因爲飛機的迅速，敏捷；遠在數千里外居高位的人。還可以到這裏來休養他們的身心。這裏是人，那裏也是人；可是少有人想到在×人鐵蹄下還有我們受難的同胞，在北方和南方，還有我們和×人以血肉相拚的勇士。</p>
<p>『他們應該享受的，因爲他們有錢。』</p>
<p>在無形中這裏好像有一個上帝這樣大聲地昭示着，生長在這裏的人，或是巳經邁過中年的人，他們都習慣了，都被人生把火性磨平了；可是她　原是充滿了力量，想毀滅自己，爲了更多人的安樂，實在是沒有法子在這裏忍下去。她時時焦燥地問着自己：」難說我是貪圖這一點安逸，難說我還沒有過慣被異族統治下的生活？難說我也忘記了在苦難中的兄弟姊妹們麼？　【未完】</p>
<h3>我對於愛國者的感想</h3>
<p>— 司馬聖</p>
<p>很早就把『愛國者』的原書讀了一遍，頗有許多感想要發揮；可是其時正有許多人動員繙譯，大有轟轟烈烈的情況，似乎未便奏趣多嘴。近來看到了市上發售的幾種譯本，不禁百感交集，竟非發揮一下不可。</p>
<p>我對於『愛國者』的感想，就是我沒有像有些人所說一樣被『感動得以政忿怒』。賽珍珠的小說，平心說一句，是沒有什麽了不得的；尤其對於中國人事的描寫，簡直淺薄得可笑。她在『大地』中描寫的中國農民生活，雖然可以『向西方人賣賣野人頭』，而給我們自家人讀了，總看得出許多破綻來。然而因爲她是一個西方人，所以這一點認講，彷彿已够使讀者們敬佩；（中國文壇上不知還有多少比她更淺薄的作品！）而她之所以能夠『轟動了美國出版界』，『發了一筆大財』，甚至還得到諾貝爾獎金者，大概就是爲了道一個緣故。以這樣一個認識不够的作家，而描寫這樣偉大的場面，這樣動亂的時代，這樣繁瑣的題材，事實上是一定不會好的。所以『愛國者』的失敗，乃是意料中的事情，本來是『何足道哉』的。可是這樣一部並不高明的著作，此次不僅又『轟動了美國出版界』，而且更『動員了大批文化人去繙譯，鼓吹』。却有點出人意表了。</p>
<p>我以爲『愛國者』的缺點，是在避難就易，避重就輕，避煩就簡。這個故事的場面，旣然包括了最近十年來的中國大事變，那麼重在描寫那些事變听反映出來的中國人；旣然展開到對日抗戰甚至漢口撤退以後的時候，那麼理應描寫到中國人民震撼世界的英勇抗戰的恣態。而作者却由於經驗的不够，竟把那些重要的因素都滑過了。所以我們翻檢原書，幾乎發現一半以上的篇幅是在描寫一段戀愛的故事；而那小半的篇幅中，也並沒有着力的描寫渲染，反而儘量地避過一切實際的場景。這是我所發現的最大的缺點。</p>
<p>此外，作者對於書中人物，寫得很模糊；這種模糊還是由於她的認識不夠，經騐不够。吳以璠和劉恩來應該是兩個前進的典型，可是被她寫成了兩個傳奇似人物，無多可取。不過，某君以爲竟有對中國侮辱處，我覺得那是有點過火的。他所摘錄的幾段，雖然『聲朋』『不是斷章取義』，但我覺得却是誤解了原義。『作者把通州事件如此表現』，乃是描寫日本報紙上無恥的宣傳。『作者……挑選了這不幸的事而加以諷刺』，以及諷刺中國空軍和陸軍，乃是描寫以珂的漢奸意識和漢奸理論。這在小說中似乎是必要的，因爲小說中的人物，不會憫個是英雄，個個是好人，總有壤人，和反面的言論的。</p>
<p>我不是偏袒原作者，却覺得賽珍珠或者是頗表同情於中國的，但因爲她認識不夠，經驗不够，因而描寫得非常模糊，有點弄巧成拙而已。如果不信，我也可以摘錄一段在下面！</p>

<h3>中救」臨別珍貴的貢獻　「永定河畔」今晚演出　描寫七月的故事緊張熱烈精彩偉大</h3>
<p>『中救』於出國之前、訂今明後三天、假座利舞台上演『永定河畔』、『大地刦』、『血濺桃花』三劇、這一次的演出、是為婦女兵災會義務籌款、所以意義特別偉大、而經過這一次演出之後、『中救』便到菲律濱轉程美國去了、</p>
<p>在香港話劇本沒有牠的地位、而且幹話劇的同志、也因為種種不方便的條件、而顯得十分脆弱、但自『中旅』『中藝』和本文所講的「中救」到港出後、香港的話劇運動、便起了活躍的作用、特別「中救」、以其完美的、精進之演出、更使香港僑胞、從新有了新之認識與新的趣味、前些時，「中救」連續演過「台兒莊之春」、「民族萬歲」、「保衛祖國」、票價曾以最低的一毫、二毫、四奄賣出、容納了許許多多僑胞、有一新眼光的機會、這個最低的票價倘使要專為賺錢的劇團、恐怕辦不出來、但「中救」是辦到了、由此可知「中救」同人的吃苦的精神、單這一點已足够大家敬佩的了，</p>
<p>至予這次的演出、却有這樣的來歷、也便在這里說明一下，一中救」本定六月底出國、赴菲轉美因船期故延到七月、大抵在七日間便可全國出國、在上次演出後港九各社谷學校紛紛請求重演、率以出國準憐過於忙迫、故术答允、而婦女乓災會呢却在「中救」抵港的時候、便首先歡迎並約合作，為難民而籌款、所以（中救）終於在出國之前、用約言兌現、遂有這一次的三天連續公演的巨大工作、</p>
<p>這一次做出將比以前更為精彩、其一是佈景之擴增、其二是籌備之得當，其三是所選劇本、均為（中救）之拿手好戲、至於動昌全體團員，却是必然之事了、</p>
<p>寄語僑胞們、要一飽眼福、一淸頭腦、務請抽空去看一下、這不單是看演劇、而且知道我們的抗戰必勝建國必成的大業、「中救」拿話劇去說明新中國的光芒、是僑胞們所最樂于了解的、因此、僑胞們不要把「中救」當作平常的劇團看、而應該對他們有更深的認識、而且、這一次演出、是為籌款救難、你多買一張票、卽是多救一條生命、眞捐輸於娛樂、實在是好不過的、</p>

<h3>「中救」臨別義演獻辭</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>『中救』這次出國宣傳，道經本港，巳在本港各界人士中間留下極深刻的印象，極自然的好感。记得上次在利舞台義演的時候，雖然連天陰雨，雖然沒有粉香肉感的引誘，却能打破本港賣座的紀綠，還有廣大的觀衆，抱着熱誠的心，却因『座滿』而怅望於戲院門外，這便是「中救」在本港所留下的光榮的紀錄、同時也可說是中救留給本港所有戲劇運動者的『指路碑』！現在『中救』出國宣傳在卽，特舉行臨别最後義演，這次義演的內容：有全國劇作者協会編劇的描寫蘆溝橋抗戰故事的『永定河畔』，有田漢章泯洪深張克等編劇的重現抗戰中國的事實的『大地劫』，有『中救」集體創作的描魯南抗戰史蹟的『血濺桃花』；而這次義演是為本港婦女兵災會籌款救濟傷兵難民。相信『中救』必能保持與發揚其上次創造的光榮紀錄，更相信必能更堅定本港劇運工作者為『使戲劇為抗戰建國服務』而奮鬥的决心！</p>
<p>『中救』是在×人的砲火下面誕生與長大起來的，『中救』還曾輾轉奔走終各路前綫和廣大的後方，自這次『最後義演』以後，就要赴菲轉美了，我希望而且相信，『中救』在國外，必能本其所見，本其所知，藝術的地，以『海燕』的姿態，去提高我廣大僑胞的民族自尊心與自信心，去號召每一個不願做奴隸的僑胞、為祖國的獨立，民族的解放與自已的幸福、為抗戰建國的最後勝利、而呈献其生動的或物質的力量、這是一。其次，『中救』組織生活和態度，是以『嚴肅，緊張，團結，活潑』著名的，也可說是具備了一個民衆救亡宣傳的基本條件的，這次到國外，更應在僑胞中間，尤其是在僑胞的救亡團體，戲劇與一般文化團體中間取得模範的作用，不僅發動，而且要組織僑胞抗戰建國正在進入一個新的甚至最後的艱險關頭，克服這一關頭的困難與危險，主要是要依靠廣大民衆的組織起來，負有『革命之母』的榮譽的華僑，在這裏是幾乎具有决定的。意義的這是二。此外，配合着××『軍事為輔政治為主』的滅華新業略，××××，以及昧却天良頑固自私的份子，正在狼狽地勾結起來，用和平反共的口號，來破壞全民族的團結，來破壞主動的全面的持久抗戰，以圖化裂進而征服中國，他們的魔手，正亦國內各地伸展，自然更猖狂地在海外華僑中間亂舞，我們必須去提高僑胞對於××此種活動的警惕性，警備並且鞏固與擴大統一戰綫，給以無情的打擊。</p>
<p>正是中華民民英勇抗戰兩週年的前夕，我們在這裏看到了『中救』演出描述盧溝橋抗戰的故事的『永定河畔』！永定河畔的戰事，是中華民族第一次發出娜對於長期××命運的抗議，是中華民族第一次認識犧牲已到最後關頭，』『此後中途妥協就是整個投誠降』，也是中華民族第一次團結起來，為維護領土主權之完整，而展開了全面抗戰。兩年後的今日，我們正在日漸脫離危難，日×泥足　在陷水益深，而汪精衞及響應汪精衞漢奸言論的明暗漢奸們，却正在企圖在我們數十萬壯烈犧牲的將士與數百萬流離失所的靴民身上，訂結賣國的條的建立『反共』的朝廷！我們們看了「中救」這次演出，一定更增×××××××××，益堅擁護中央擁護蔣委員長完成抗戰建國的决心。與信心。××××××××，才是眞正和平最後勝利寬現之日！我希望「中救」和本港劇運工作者一致努力爭取這一天的提前到來！</p>
<h3>抗戰戲劇的前衛</h3>
<p>— 黃達才</p>
<p>『中救』快要出國了。</p>
<p>這句話，在目前，成為戲劇工作者，文化界的談話或寫作的資料。</p>
<p>在未出國之前，而且在「中救」為婦女兵災會演劇籌欵的時候，特地在這里，借寳貴的篇幅，簡單講幾句話。</p>
<p>『中救』同人，是戲劇工作者，當然三句不離本行，但與其說是戲劇運動，倒不如稱為抗戰戲劇運動，來得更加切當。戲劇是有其世界性的，無國界的。美國的歌舞影片，肉感影片，法西的侵略影片，麻醉影片，都不能否認牠不是戲劇。可是對象不同，作用就有危險的傾向了。比如我們目前老拿肉感片歌舞片侵略片，麻醉片，作為我們的戲劇而放映出來傳播開去。那未，這影響，就不堪設想。因為觀衆被麻醉，就失了警覺，對自己不知振奮，對國家不知出力。這樣發展下去，其結果就有亡國滅種的危慮！</p>
<p>明白這點，我們就可以知道抗戰戲劇之急需而且必需。抗戰戲劇的意義是：把抗戰建國的偉大而艱苦的工程；把抗戰建國的壯烈和英勇的事跡，具體地用各種不同的手法，透過了戲劇的範圍，織成感化的作用。去激起感情的共鳴，促進萬心為一心。他的最終目的是：把全力去支持抗戰建國，把全力去對抗當前的唯一×人———日本軍閥。</p>
<p>上面所講的，祇是起碼的抗戰戲劇的原則。違背了這個原則的戲劇，不稱配為抗戰戲劇。在最艱苦的最嚴重的抗戰建國的戲劇里頭，祇有「國策第一」，「抗戰第一」。因此，對於違反抗戰建國的戲劇，我們可以提出批判的任務，但同時，我們應該拿自已的『貨色』出來。</p>
<p>「中救」的「貨色」，就是眞正的，勇敢的抗戲劇。在過去，現在，將來，都永遠保待一個原則，一個信仰，那就是『民族至上』，『勝利至上』！</p>
<p>這之間「中救」準備以全力做去，無論到那一塊地方。這里可以保證，而且堅信，』中救』决不會一時高興演一個與美國歌舞片肉感片同一節的歌舞和肉感戲劇；也决不會像違反時代的法西的侵略片和麻醉片一樣對蠻一樣兇悍。『中救』的抗戰戲劇是正義的，寄予無上的生存眞理的。世界上凡是要生存的民族，凡是抵抗侵略的民族，都應該有一看「中救」的抗戰戲劇的必要，而且有參加『中救』的抗戰戲劇的必要。</p>
<p>在今日，法西魔手正準備而且已經過下血手，去奪取生存的民族。西有德，意，佛朗哥，東方有××××的日本，在若干國度，都懼於法西的威　，企求妥協的時候，而我們却英勇地予打擊者以打擊。我們曾經抵抗日本軍閥，有二年多久，把×人速戰速速决，速戰速和的毒計，擊得粉碎，</p>
<p>所以中華民族才是世界的優秀民族，中華民族已經替民主國家打了兩年猛烈的前鋒。</p>
<p>『中救』就是在這兩個血肉的年頭中，鍛鍊和成長起來，『中救』巳經把他自己的眞正的；勇敢的，有價値的『貨色』走遍了南北戰區，感化了千萬將士與民衆、現在出國，一句話是：把抗戰必勝，建國必成的信念直接吿訴僑胞，同時，把僑胞的熱情和僑胞的力量，帶囘祖國，共同爭取勝利。</p>
<p>『中救』快要出國了。</p>
<p>這句話，在目前，成為戲劇工作者，文化界的談話或寫作的資料。</p>
<p>但我得代為呼籲：在香港。在國內的文化人。戲劇工作者，社會人士，請予『中救』以熱烈的支援。</p>
<p>金山說過：『如果我們是哨兵，那末，我們希望國內的，僑港的文化界，全國同胞，做我們的後盾，敎導和指示我們！』。</p>

<p>我國散在全世界的橋民，是抗戰有力的支柱；在推翻滿清統治的　　，和打倒封建軍閥的國民革命中，他們盡過最大的力；七七以後，他們表現了更偉大的力；這是必然的，沒有廣活地動員僑胞的人力物力，則我們的全國總動員不能算是完成；沒有僑胞的返國服務和踴躍輸將，民族解放戰的勝利，必不能如我們預想之快。</p>
<p>可是僑胞的文化水準太低了，他們精神上的粮食太缺乏了；他們對於祖國的搏鬥離得太遠，他們日常的精神也缺乏榮養，這時候，能夠對他們通俗地，形象地報告祖國鬥爭的消息，描繪四萬萬求解放的面貌，解决他們智識的餓荒，組織他們服務的情緒，最有力量的媒介是藝術，是眞血眞肉在律動的戲劇藝術，是在炮火中鍛鍊出來的抗戰戲劇藝術。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>抗戰開始以後，武漢合唱團到南洋不但能够自給，而且匯呈了大批的　項給中央，伶人新覩就在美國在南洋的努力，使我們前方多了很多架救護車，最近南洋頂小的地方都有了話劇團，國內許多名劇都上演了。</p>
<p>南洋和各地的僑胞，不只救國的熱情更昂揚，連藝術的需要與欣賞的能力都進步了。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>現在，正是展開華僑劇達最好的契機。要</p>
<p>（一）報吿祖國的為解放和建設新中國的鬥爭；</p>
<p>（二）描繪僑胞在中國革命史中的光榮事蹟；</p>
<p>（三）介紹國內的抗戰劇本，使大家接觸新內容，由這內容，加得對祖國的理解和親切；</p>
<p>（四）示範和指導，使抗戰劇運隨處有崗位，有小站中站乃至總站；</p>
<p>（五）×××××××××××××××××××！</p>

<h3>『中救』頌</h3>
<p>— 蟬鳴</p>
<p>我用充滿了感動的熱情歌頌着『中救』，一如歌頌英勇而光榮的將士為祖國的大地而戰鬥一樣！</p>
<p>一羣英勇的戲劇戰士，鬥爭了近仕個月的歷盡了許多艱卒，走遍了南北戰場，數千里的烽火征途，踏過了無涯的山疇田廓，終而負着光榮的實踐底經騐、到遙遠的海外去。作祖國抗戰的宣示。這種百折不撓的精神與魄力，不是文字底素描，更不是虛偽的談言，而是活生生的實况，千錘百煉的眞蹟！！</p>
<p>這種優秀而偉大的為祖國抗戰而服務的工作者，是如何的値得我們每個中華兒女歌頌喲！</p>
<p>香港的戲劇運動從來沒有開過這樣的燦爛底火花，一如這兩月來光茫地照耀着我們的劇壇；但「中救」却給我們燃燒了光明的火之源來，在這兩個月當中香港的戲劇高潮是澎漲到怎樣的頂點，而所有的人們，對祖國底愛懷有着眷戀的人們，是如何被捲擁在劇戲的狂潮中呢！</p>
<p>中救，為香港劇壇寫下一頁永將不朽的史記，前後他們上演了四次，打破了素稱衊視話劇的人底夢囈，而把許為祖國前線戰鬥　利的實蹟，以戲劇藝術的手腕上演在舞台上，加强生活在紅燈綠酒下的人對×人的認識，這樣積極地含有國防抗戰意識的現實藝術，對民族解放戰鬥是盡了很大的貢献！</p>
<p>這次的演出，在香港而言是最後的尾聲，也是怒吼的重現，很快地，海波會把他們帶到海外去，把實生活的經驗工作精神，召示給僑胞們，祖國是不會屈服的，我們的民族將永生於我們的大地上！</p>
<p>他們的過去與將來，　是在祖國戰鬥的旗幟下鬥爭的。願『中救』的精神將永偕祖國的永生而存在。</p>
<h3>「中救」的惠贈</h3>
<p>— 朱白水</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>我常常有着一種不易為人所了解的沉默底寄懷，尤其是近日來眷戀于小病的床榻上悵的情緒充滿了心坎。</p>
<p>「中救」的留港最後献演的訊息我早知道。固然是一件令人興奮的事但我自己，却同時深深感到無限的迷　！</p>
<p>——最後的献演底跟尾，是會把他們引　着離開香港而到海外去的呀！</p>
<p>在個人的友精上，在工作的學習上『中救』的離港，似乎是一種遺憾的損失、雖然他們不久怕仍將重囘故土的、但無論如何、遙遠地使友情與學習都有了暫時的分隔和疏遠、</p>
<p>這種分隔和疏遠是會使一個深靜地懷有富于友情底牽縈的人感到迷　與難堪的</p>
<p>然而，誰能輕易地阻留這夥行裝待束的旅人呢？為了祖國偉大的民族自衛抗戰底務利的宣示，他們是英勇的肩負了一個不算輕微的担子到海外僑胞那裏去啊！</p>
<p>愿他們在這次献演的完結之後，有着一個愉快的海洋底旅途！</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>有時在深夜醒來，默默地想憶到許多；使自已更　湎的就是遙望烽火遍野的祖國，在那麽廣大的土地上，×人殘酷地蹂躪了我們的　墳相作坊，但却遭遇了莫大的意想不到的反抗與囘擊！壓迫和屠殺使懦弱的畏怯的都强倔起來，靑年的一代更英勇地在不斷的鬥爭中長成着。</p>
<p>『中救』，就這樣在艱苦的民族解放鬥爭中發展而生長了，廿個月來，他們負着道具，服裝，和舞台的用具馳騁于南北戰場，在轟炸中來去，在艱苦中鬥爭，發揮了戰時戲劇藝術最優秀的力量，在不斷的工作，不斷的鍛鍊，成了一夥抗戰洪濟中戲劇工作者的勁旅！</p>
<p>帶着千辛萬苦的行脚，離開了祖國的大地，負相着偉大的使命到海外宣傳和籌捐，海輪帶了他們最先到達這國際宣傳第一站的香港，並且暫時地驛旅在這殖民地上。</p>
<p>香港的戰時戲劇運動以一九三八年五月海關長征團到港演出了「塞上風雲」，而至九月中旅來港連演後，香港的劇壇雖有了新的轉變，但沒有更豐盛的逗引，踏進一九三九，我們開始有了新的生命了，「中救」的到港，使整個香港劇壇進展至一個高潮的境界，無疑地，中救是强而有力的燃燒起香港的劇壇烽火了！</p>
<p>在這期中，整個杳港被捲進于一個戲劇的狀潮中、這種力量决不是別的隊伍可以輕而易舉的做到的，也决不是別的隊伍可以矯揉做作或過份誇張地可以收獲的。</p>
<p>「中救」賜給香港劇壇的功績，就是完全明顯地指出從祖國偉大的抗戰中鍛鍊出來的優秀的工作者底實踐收獲了！！</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>香港的劇壇分野地素為人畸視着的，從不為有閑者所看重，他們覺得這是一種　童的玩意或抗戰口號的無聊工具，這種不上眼的「戲」，自然値不得去花時間，化錢更不行！</p>
<p>『中救』英勇地拯救了他們，拯救了這一大夥戴了黃色眼鏡的人，誠懇地引帶他們電新去欣賞一種眞正的屬于藝術的娛樂，更以精銳宏偉的演出中吿訴他們：祖國是在如何艱辛與苦門中去翻身，去求民族的自由獨立，我們的××是如何殘酷的在我們的祖墳田地上搶掠……使他們驚心，也使他們飲泣，但更憤恨而狂奮！</p>
<p>在這一點，中救消滅了有根深蒂固的對話劇存衊滅輕視的人底不良心理。</p>
<p>同樣的，從事于戲劇工作者的人他們對香港劇壇感到苦悶，感到無出路，感到前　淡漠，尤其是，他們以似眞非眞的設抗戰戲劇在香港不能賣錢，不可以供職業化上演，因此，很巧妙地兆避現實的希望上演為藝術而藝術的戲劇。</p>
<p>可是，中救卻嚴正的答應了他們，抗戰戲劇並不是不可以賣錢，並不是不可以供職業化的團體上演，問題就是沒有把精湛的優秀的藝術放進抗戰戲劇氛圍中去通過了藝術形式的抗戰作品，决不會沒有靈魂的，决不會沒有觀衆愛好的。我們不能完全說「中救」的演出是百分之百的優越，但在熱烈的觀衆底感奮欲　中，我們可以估計他們的演出　表現是如何的，</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>我們是怎樣地感動的對于這一顆在祖國的大地上生長起來的戰士——似乎，我們冉用不着秀麗的文字或頌詞參加在中救的身上了，一個崇高的英雄，他是會躱在大樹蔭下，默默地憶想自已的戰蹟……</p>
<p>眞的，中救是太需要更坦白的更眞誠的意見了。</p>
<p>我奇怪，他們偉大的演出，在香港為什麽始終看不到更精眞的正確批判呢？最少，中救的朋友們怕也感到自已有許多未盡善的地方　，敬愛他們的人是這樣的崇仰着他們，但為什麽却不更摯誠的確切的吿訴些他們已知或未知的好事呢？</p>
<p>這樣做，我相信會使『中救』更進步的生長着的，</p>
<p>中救，敎育了我們許多，常常在許多場合中。太使我感動了，對工作是這樣的認眞，苦幹，對友情是這樣熱烈，誠摯、許多不易遺忘的記憶，將永遠地記在自己的囘憶中。</p>
<p>願這許多感人的記憶，會使自己常常憶念着這一顆英勇的鬥士吧！</p>
<p>一九三九，六，卅，病中。</p>
<h3>編後</h3>
<p>中國救亡劇團從今天起又在利舞台作大規模的臨別第七四六次義演了，為了對他們這次演出作一個比較詳盡的報導，對他們留港三月來工作作一次比較客觀的估計，本刊這一期又提前一天和讀者諸君見面了。</p>
<p>對於中救，我們一再毫不吝惜我們的篇幅，在編者的見地，一方面是站在救亡劇運的立場，希望香港的劇運因為他們到港的刺激而更逢勃起來；而另一方面，則感於「中救一同人嚴肅而澈底的為民族解放而犧牲一切的工作精神，不屈不撓勇敢苦幹的堅强毅力和樸實誠懇的高度熱情，嚴密鞏固而民主的組織和嚴肅的工作紀律，勤奮不息的學習精神和刻苦耐勞的鬥爭生活……這些，都値得我們學習與發揚的。</p>
<p>對於任何個人，任何團體，我們都有一個願望：作公允的批判，攝取其優點，揚棄其缺點，對好的光明的我們决無條件的盡力代為宣傳。不好的我們亦將不客氣的檢討；但，盲目的捧場與無理的漫罵，却是眞正的工作者所不取的。至於「中救」諸同志，戰地二十月與香港三月的工作成績如何，工作精神，工作態度又如何，我想不必待我來說了。</p>
<p>現在「中救」離港在卽。姜明先生曾在業聯社歡送「中救」席上，提議以本刊為今後「中救」與本港戲劇工作者通訊聯系的地方，這一點，編者是很高興盡力的希望中救離港以後，常和我們發生聯系，而本港的戲劇工作者，也希望能更踴躍的來運用本刊這一點篇幅！　（編者）</p>
<h3>烽火彌漫的七月</h3>
<p>— 伍禾</p>
<p>關於永定河畔</p>
<p>又是七月了，這是一個最可紀念，最値得歌頌的時候，忍受了七年屈辱的中華民族，從七月起，以堅强雄偉的姿態，屹立在大地上，一舒七年的積憤，要翻起身來做主人！</p>
<p>前年七月，蘆溝橋上第一炮，使我們每一個不願做奴隸的中國人，挺起了腰桿，流出了歡欣的眼淚，我們都興奮的跳起來，把七年來沒有說的話，痛痛快快的說了，用一種巨壯的聲音，把七年來——不，四十年來沒有做的事，也痛痛快快的做了，中華民族開始掙斷束縛着自已的鎖鍊，用血肉爭取我們民族的自由！</p>
<p>可謳歌的七月呵！</p>
<p>中華民族的子孫，在七月應該加倍感奮倍加努力！使蘆溝橋上的英烈，含笑九泉，使兇殘無比的××，加速崩潰！</p>
<p>前年七月，全國劇作者協會號召了全上海劇人，在上海演『永定河畔』，希望把盧溝橋鬥爭的種子撤佈在我們居留了許多年代的上海，希望在上海，燃起已高舉於永定河畔的民族解放鬥爭的火炬！</p>
<p>今天，我們在香港，為了紀念七月，把「永定河畔』作這次義演的第一個節目，我們沉浸在深歷的回憶中了：當時全國緊張的氣氛，奮興的情緒，鬥爭的决心，英勇的行徑，都歷深如在目前；而這些親切的心緒情境，是可寳貴的。今天想借助於這個戲，傳達給觀衆，使觀衆拿起一面歷史的鏡子作一個抗戰初期的囘溯，有所警惕，有所策勵。</p>
<p>這一次『永定河畔』，在前面加上了一個『序幕』。這個「序幕』，本來是一個獨幕劇，但是，單獨演出，很難掘發觀眾更深的情緒。現在加在「永定河畔」的前面，或者可以使本劇略形完整，而這個獨幕劇却原因之而獲得了新的生命。</p>
<p>這個「序幕』，有一個朋友說的很好：『像課歷史敎科書』，這課書，勾勒了從九一八到蘆溝橋的情景：東山省被强佔了，熱河被掠奪了，那父親的容忍，兒子的憤怒，直到蘆溝橋（原作：平津）的决鬥，都象徵的寫出來了。這眞是一課歷史，而這歷史，是我們應該翻閱的！尤其在抗戰兩週年的今天，我們要熟讀九一八以來×人侵略中國的歷程，前事不忘，正所以策勵來茲。</p>
<p>聽說這個戲在香港還是初次上演，擺在「序幕」的前面，讓他第一次和香港的觀衆見面吧，觀衆在烽火瀰漫的七月，能從這個戲裏窺見兩年前像浪潮一樣的洶湧的抗戰行動，像鋼鐵一樣堅强的抗戰意志，而感覺到『序幕』又正幫助了整個戲的完整，則『九一八以來』在今日還有新鮮的生命！</p>

<h3>Wang’s Treacherous Acts of Selling Out the Nation</h3>
<p>According to a Tianjin dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th, Wang Zhao-ming has indeed arrived in Peiping on the 26th, traveling by plane from Shanghai via Tianjin. Wang’s purpose in going to Peiping is to discuss with the Peiping traitors how to organize a puppet federal government. According to Shanghai news, Wang Kemin had previously sent people to Shanghai to discuss the formation of a puppet central government with the Wang faction. In the middle of this month, a group of traitors also held a meeting in Shanghai, with representatives from the two puppet organizations in Peiping and Nanjing, as well as the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, also participating. Therefore, Wang's trip to Peiping seems reliable. A Reuters dispatch further stated: "The Japanese are now preparing to issue a declaration on the second anniversary of the 'July 7th' Sino-Japanese War, organizing a puppet central government in the form of a federation. It is conceivable that the group of traitors and the Japanese warlords are eager to resolve the Sino-Japanese War through political means."</p>
<p>We observe the situation from all sides. The reasons why the Japanese are in a hurry to establish a puppet central government are probably no more than the following: First, the Japanese army has besieged the British in Tianjin and has already obtained a certain degree of concession from the British in an intangible way. Now, the local incident has been moved to Tokyo for negotiations. Japan naturally cannot let go of this opportunity and quickly create a powerful and concrete so-called "fait accompli" to deceive the current British government authorities, bargain, and ×××× accept the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side. Second, the Japanese military authorities have also realized that they cannot end the Sino-Japanese War by military force alone and save themselves from being trapped deeper and deeper. At the beginning of June, Hitler warned the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima: Japan's losses in the war of aggression against China are considerable and cannot be recovered without seven or eight years of long-term recuperation. Itagaki and other army leaders were certainly very frustrated upon hearing this news, but the facts still speak louder than eloquence. Therefore, even the military department had to cancel its initial opposition to using Wang. Third, since the Japanese side attaches greater importance to the role of political conspiracy than to military power, then it is necessary to choose a deceptive figure to use traitors. Wang was once an important figure in the Kuomintang and held an important position in the National Government. He also occupied a position in the past Chinese revolutionary history. Wang's conditions best meet the requirements of the Japanese side. It is heard that the Japanese side has agreed to several firm demands of Wang: First, to establish a puppet central government in Nanjing and make the two puppet organizations in Peiping and Ningxia local governments: Second, the national emblem proposed by Wang, which is the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Five-Colored Flag. These facts are not accidental.</p>
<p>Wang's coming to the stage, like a monkey wearing a hat, playing the role of the chief culprit of the puppet regime, is probably not a problem. However, Wang's crimes will be substantiated by this performance, ××××××××××. The National Government has formally issued a strict order to arrest him, calling him a "traitor." Condemnations from all sides are flying in like snowflakes. Today, Wang is not only betraying the Republic of China, but also harming the people of the whole country. In addition to the explicit arrest warrant issued by the National Government, "all of our people in the country should criticize Wang verbally and in writing, and it is right to do so at this time" (words of Long Yun, governor of the province). ××××××××, it will not fail to make one a Chinese national hero, and in the annals of history it will be immortal alongside Yue Wu Mu!</p>
<p>Special Article of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>On Guerrilla Warfare on the Plains</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shiti</p>
<p>Already, night combat, the plains are suitable for night activities, night activities can also reduce the effectiveness of ×'s technology, since our war of resistance, we have carried out many night battles, and have achieved many victories, we must promote the experience of night battles, and take more night activities and battles, but night activities also have many weaknesses, such as it is not easy for commanders to grasp the troops, it is easy to lose contact, communication is difficult to be thorough, so misunderstandings are inevitable, × people stubbornly defend houses, it is not easy to overcome, and troops are prone to panic, etc., which is something that needs special attention to overcome in night warfare, on November 13, our ×× regiment encountered × at Huashipian at night, we were able to quickly attack × people, × people's artillery could not be used, and tried to retreat to the village to hold on, but the second battalion of our ×× regiment quickly occupied the village, although some of the × people had already entered the village, but under the fierce attack of our grenades, × people could not occupy it, had no way to escape, and were mostly annihilated by us, the experience of this night battle is that the × situation and terrain were scouted very clearly, the movements were also very rapid and resolute, and the communication and command were good, which is worth learning in the future,</p>
<p>Noon, the terrain of the plains is open, even a single blade of grass, a small ditch or a low ridge has great value, and special attention should be paid to using them in battle, and using a low posture, which is very important,</p>
<p>Not yet, in peacetime combat, it is necessary to estimate that × people's reinforcements are faster than in mountainous areas, so the vigilance during combat must be strengthened in the main areas, to be able to guarantee that the main force solves the battle, at the same time, the plains have convenient transportation, and × people can detour to our rear, so it is necessary to leave a necessary reserve force, (when ambushing in mountainous areas, we often only pay attention to the vigilance on both sides and do not pay attention to the rear vigilance, which is also wrong), in November, the second battalion of our ×× regiment won a complete victory in the ambush north of Gui Sui; however, × people reinforced from Wu Chuan, and after collapsing the guard platoon of mine in the temple, detoured to the rear of the second battalion, cutting off my return route, the rear of the second battalion had no vigilance, and responded hastily, unprepared, not only were all the spoils lost, but they also suffered losses themselves, which is a lesson,</p>
<p>(D) Reconnaissance</p>
<p>Child, at any time and space, all means should be used to conduct thorough reconnaissance, which is even more important on the plains, on the plains, the value of all terrain and features increases, the reconnaissance of terrain and roads is also important, and the reconnaissance of residents should not be relaxed,</p>
<p>Ugly, the means of reconnaissance on the plains are generally the same as in mountainous areas, and now only the means and methods that should be paid special attention to are put forward,</p>
<p>A, spies can get the news of × people as early as possible, this kind of reconnaissance should be strengthened, in each × people's station, we must find ways to dispatch them,</p>
<p>B, each unit, even small striking teams, should have their own scouts to constantly scout, and pay attention to night reconnaissance, otherwise, for example, when the ×× regiment was in Qingman Mountain, × people used cars to carry troops close to Qingman Mountain Regiment Park at night, because we could not observe it at night, we only knew when × started to attack at dawn, and suffered a little loss,</p>
<p>C, in addition to the main force dispatching reconnaissance, each guard unit (such as the outpost, platoon post, small post) should also send its own reconnaissance team, or 5-6 to more than 10 li in front of the guard area in the main direction, to conduct continuous reconnaissance in order to understand the situation as early as possible, which is very important, especially at night,</p>
<p>D, a strict reconnaissance network should be established in the area of operation, extending our reconnaissance to × people's stations and their vicinity, so that we can know every move of the × people in time,</p>
<p>The personnel in charge of the reconnaissance outline are mainly the people in the cities, towns and villages who are loyal to the cause of resistance, and sometimes the troops can also send people to take charge, no matter what kind of component is responsible for leading the reconnaissance troops, the reconnaissance outline personnel should be given the necessary reconnaissance education, and people should be sent to guide and inspect them frequently,</p>
<p>In addition to carrying out reconnaissance themselves, the reconnaissance network personnel should use reliable masses to help with reconnaissance,</p>
<p>E, on the plains, especially in areas close to × people, × people's reconnaissance troops and human scouts are also frequently active, so the disguise of reconnaissance is also important, such as the scouts of the first detachment, and even their workers, work in Yangqu, Jingyuan, Wenshui, and other Pingdi Jiaocheng, mostly wearing plain clothes and mixing in the crowd, sometimes also with the good citizen certificate issued by the × people, so even if the surroundings are × people, or encounter × people, there is no danger,</p>
<p>F, in addition to the troops themselves dispatching reconnaissance, it is necessary to mobilize the people to automatically report × information to us, such as the □□ regiment, when it was in Baijiazhuang last November, × people attacked from three routes and passed through the villages on the three routes, and the masses automatically came to report, so that my ×× regiment could deploy calmly, and recently, the company of the ×× regiment east of Yanmen sent a communication soldier to deliver a letter, and when they arrived at Laowo, they happened to encounter seven × people searching the village, the masses knew that the communication soldier was a member of our ×× army, and immediately reported it, and took the communication soldier to hide in the mountains, these examples are numerous, so the reconnaissance work relies on the strength of the residents, which is an exceptionally important part,</p>
<p>(E) Vigilance</p>
<p>No matter the size of the troops, and whether they are stationary or active, the vigilance must be strengthened and more reliable than in mountainous areas to ensure the safety of the main force, not to be attacked by ×, and to be able to deal with it calmly</p>
<p>(F) Communication</p>
<p>In plains marching and combat, the formation is wider and more dispersed than in mountainous areas, and at the same time, due to air defense considerations, the camping site may sometimes be dispersed in a larger area, and more reconnaissance guards are dispatched, so it is necessary to have a more thorough and reliable communication, the principles of communication are not much different from those in mountainous areas, in addition to using all our communication tools as much as possible, the following matters should be noted:</p>
<p>Child, communication on the plains is easy, and flag language and signs should be used more?</p>
<p>Ugly, strengthen cavalry communication,</p>
<p>Yin, establish bicycle communication?</p>
<p>Mao, establish communication in the masses, or use local government agencies, especially for units with few communication tools: but in order to be reliable and fast, it is still necessary to use one's own communication tools as much as possible (the use of government agencies and mass communication networks is limited to cases where one's own communication tools are insufficient and some unimportant and non-urgent matters),</p>
<p>(G) Dealing with ××'s attacks</p>
<p>The tactics of × people's attacks are indeed more advanced now than in the past, in the past winter and spring, × people's attacks on our army were still not sudden, and they followed the regular combat methods, "approaching deployment, firepower preparation, charging," such as the ×× regimental troops that attacked Bai Zhuang and Yang Jia Jing in November and December last year, but they have improved after April and May this year, and they often act at night, surround our station before dawn, cut off our army's road, do not fire guns, bypass our guard line, and suddenly launch a charge, making us caught off guard, such as the attack on my ×× independent battalion of Xin Ping in April, and the attack on the second battalion of my ×× regiment of Zhao Jia Yao in June, etc., and sometimes they also use pre-ambush on the roadside where our army often travels to carry out a sudden attack, such as after June and July, the Shuo County × often sent dozens of people in the villages and forests west and south of Shuo County to attack our guerrillas and capture our workers, and in November, the fifth company of my ×× regiment solved a unit of puppet troops in the plain south of Kebiqi, and obtained 40-50 war horses, Sheng He returned to the vicinity of Sidao Hezi north of Bikqi, because they did not pay attention to reconnaissance and vigilance, the victory was completely lost, since the war of resistance, all our units have been attacked by × more than 20 times in total, some of which were failures for the × people, and some of which were successes for the × people, after checking, the main reason for the success of the × people's attacks is not that the × people's attack technology has greatly improved, but that we do not understand the × people's tactics enough, we misjudge the × situation, our alertness is poor, and we do not pay attention to reconnaissance and vigilance,</p>
<p>According to Article 5 of the "Battlefield Education Materials" issued by Yamaguchi, the brigade commander of the × 109th Division: "To achieve great results against the × people who adopt guerrilla tactics, there is no other way but to use surprise attacks, therefore, the operation of small detachments using night maneuvers, acting bravely and boldly, deserves special commendation, and it is necessary to keep secrets and pay attention to camouflage," the fact is also true, such as the Jiaoye Battalion of the Kawazaki Regiment of the × 109th Division departed from Wutai at 8:00 pm on November 2, took a 60-li mountain road, to attack the □th Brigade of our Border Region in Hongkou Town, and after the attack, they marched back to Wutai on the night of the 3rd (Note: On the night of the 3rd, the × people returned to the vicinity of Huashi Pian, and were ambushed by a certain regiment of our army, and most of them were annihilated),</p>
<p>× people's attacks on our army are proactive, and × people believe that "there is no other way but to use surprise attacks," it can be seen that × people's attack actions are the main tactics against guerrilla troops, × people often force our army in mountainous areas, and in the plains, × people's actions to attack our army will inevitably increase, and the troops or guerrillas in the plains must pay close attention to our research to deal with × people's attacks, and now the methods and principles of dealing with × people's attacks are described as follows (to be continued)</p>

<h3>The Situation Along the Coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang is Increasingly Tense; Many of the Troops in the Yangtze River Region have been Transferred Elsewhere, Leaving the Actual Strength Empty; Intense Battles on the Northern Front, Our Army Wins Repeated Victories</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Chongqing, 30th] Nearly 20,000 × near the Yangtze River have withdrawn from Hankou to Nanjing, and a part of the × in central Hubei has also withdrawn to Hankou. Currently, × is taking a defensive posture in Hubei. There are about 1,000 remaining × in Tianmen, and no more than 2,000 in the Jing Shan and Ying Shan areas. They have no ability to attack again. Our army is active along the Ping Han Railway, constantly cutting off transportation. Our guerrillas near Nanchang have repeatedly attacked ×, and at the old airfield, × planes have been blown up several times by landmines we planted, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Chongqing, 30th] Guerrilla warfare is very fierce in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu. About 6,000 × in Ju County, Mengyin, and Yishui are under our control. Fierce battles have been fought for days near Jicheng in southern Shanxi, killing 600-700 ×. 600-700 × from Zhangdian Houwang attacked my Su Han Village Junzhuang, but were repelled, suffering more than 100 casualties.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Jieyang</p>
<p>[Continental News Agency Xingning Express News] × continues to attempt to attack Jieyang. On the Chaoan side, × claimed to attack west along the Chao Jie Highway, but it was actually a feint. × increased its troops and advanced from the west of Fuyang, and also gathered many shallow-water submarines at Guanbu. On the 28th and 29th, they sailed upstream along the tributaries of the Han River, attempting to encircle and attack the county seat, posing a great threat. Our main force has been divided to intercept them. General ××× is directing operations on the front lines. The Fourth War Zone Military Law Enforcement Supervisory Department has also dispatched senior inspectors to the front to supervise the execution of combat orders by various units. They passed through Xingning on the 28th and went to the front.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Liuhuang, 29th] The ×× unit of our army that stubbornly defended the county seat of Chaoan charged out of the city several times on the 28th and attacked ×, killing many on the spot. × constantly launched fierce attacks, using intense artillery fire to densely bombard the southeast gates. The sound of the artillery shook the heavens and the earth. The city walls, streets, and houses were shattered to pieces. Our defending soldiers still braved death to fight back. As × approached, they jumped out to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. In the afternoon, × planes swarmed in to attack, unleashing bombs and machine guns. More than half of the city was turned to ashes. Our army still used the broken walls and ruins as cover, exacting the greatest possible price from × with a spirit of certain death. In the evening, × became more and more numerous and poured into the city in large numbers. Our isolated army withdrew from Chaoan City in street battles, and moved to the Yixi Beixiang area north of the city to await an opportunity to counterattack. Chaoan was thus declared to have completely fallen into the hands of the × army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Wengyuan, 30th] On the 28th, our plainclothes team detoured from a certain place and charged into the Longyandong Yantang Shahe area in the suburbs of Guangzhou to attack the × army. They planted the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flags all over the nearby ridges.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Wengyuan, 30th] On the morning of the 28th, more than 1,000 × infantry and artillerymen fled west from Zhongluotan via Xiangshan. At dusk, a part of them clashed with us south of Huaxian County. On the morning of the 29th, more than 1,000 × reinforcements from Guangzhou made contact with our vanguard troops at Longkouzhuang.</p>
<p>× Warships Gather in the Min Sea</p>
<p>(Central News Agency Fuzhou, 30th) The × who attacked the East Islands belonging to my Pingtan County were repelled by us. At noon on the 29th, several more × boats, under the cover of × warships and planes, attacked my Pingze Guanyin'ao, intending to forcibly land, but were also immediately repelled by our army and fled back to the × warships.</p>
<p>(Reuters Tokyo, 30th) The Japanese authorities have just decided to postpone the blockade of Fuzhou for several days to allow two British destroyers there to evacuate British nationals. After the British nationals are evacuated, the Japanese will blockade the port, it is said.</p>
<p>(Reuters Shanghai, 30th) It is reported that about 36 British sailors have been transferred from the British gunboat "Gnat" to the British Consulate in Fuzhou to protect the lives and property of British nationals. The "Gnat" was specially transferred from the Yangtze River to Fuzhou because it can navigate the shallow Min River. It is said that 16 Japanese warships are now concentrated outside Fuzhou Harbor.</p>
<p>(Reuters Shanghai, 30th) Yesterday, Japanese planes bombed the property of an American church in the suburbs of Fuzhou, and three bombs hit it, including one incendiary bomb, which burned the entire property to the ground. Fortunately, no one was injured. Japanese planes first bombed villages far from Fuzhou, and then bombed the suburbs of Fuzhou.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency Jinhua, 28th) At 1:00 a.m. this morning, more than ten × warships outside the Zhenjiang Estuary attempted to land at Guantou. Our defending army gave them a fierce shooting, and the × retreated. At 8:00 a.m., a small number of × troops landed at Zhongtang Lingmen in Yongjia County, and by 10:30 a.m., they were repelled by us. Also, in the sea areas of Huangda'ao, etc., there were more than thirty × ships cruising on the sea today, and they frequently shelled our coastal towns.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency Fuzhou, 30th) At noon on the 29th, several × motorboats carrying 200-300 × soldiers suddenly attacked my Wei Yu Island outside the mouth of the Min River (between Changmen Chuanshi Island), attempting to land. Our defending army waited for them to approach the shore and immediately gave them a head-on blow. The × troops could not escape and were killed in large numbers. Several × boats were also hit. Knowing that it was difficult to succeed, the × troops fled in a panic.</p>
<p>Our Army Counterattacks Jicheng</p>
<p>(Ming Ge News Agency Xiangning, 30th) While × has been attacking south for days in Taiyue Mountain, a certain army of mine has launched a fierce counterattack against × in the direction of Yicheng, fighting fiercely for five or six days, killing a large number of ×. From the 20th to the 25th, × used 60 trucks every day to carry the wounded soldiers and corpses, and the sound of crying was incessant along the way. The panic of × can be seen.</p>
<p>(Ming Ge News Agency Changzhi, 30th) A unit of my army attacked the Sanwanghuabao Station north of Handan the night before last, and fought fiercely with × for several hours, once capturing the station. Subsequently, × counterattacked with a train, nine cars, and four armored vehicles from the north. My army then withdrew from the battle. In this battle, more than 20 × were killed, and a portion of military supplies was captured. Also, on the morning of the 22nd, a unit of about 300 × from Yongnian attacked northwest, and fought fiercely with a certain unit of mine for two hours. The × troops were defeated and routed on all fronts, killing more than 20 ×, and capturing two puppet captains and five puppet soldiers.</p>
<p>(Ming Ge News Agency Yulin, 30th) The × in western Sui have recently been acting again, attempting to attack my Hetao. It has been widely rumored in recent days that the central government has ordered the complete relocation of the famous Inner Zhao Temple on Langshan (northwest of Wu Xi). According to those who have moved out of the mountains, a large number of × troops have started west from Bailingchu, attached with many tanks, and are stationed at the ferry crossings of Wu Han Temple, Laohukou, and Xida. × artillery fire covers the attempt to cross the river forcibly. After being defended by my certain unit, the × troops were defeated and routed in a panic after four hours of fierce fighting. In this battle, dozens of × were killed, including × Xiang County commander Yuan Dian Dashen.</p>
<p>(Ming Ge News Agency Yulin, 30th) A certain regiment of puppet troops stationed in Jishui River has been repairing roads to Yuqing Ferry for days, attempting to attack west. After a night attack by my certain unit, a fierce battle was fought all night, killing more than 20 × officers and soldiers. According to a senior officer at the front, Baotou currently has 1,500 ×, attached with more than ten tanks and more than eighty cars. Troops on the Ping Sui Line have been reading about × troops starting west. My units have made strict arrangements, and if × disturbs the west, they will be severely hit.</p>
<h3>One Week of Battle Situation: May 23rd to 29th, Announced by the Military Commission</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Chongqing, 29th) The spokesperson of the Military Commission said that in the past week, the northern and southern wars have been quite dramatic. The × in southern Jin suffered heavy losses, and its eight attempts to attack Zhongtiao Mountain finally suffered serious blows. On the other lines, our army has also achieved smaller victories. The × have landed and harassed in various coastal areas, but the × have no penetrating force. The process is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong</p>
<p>After occupying Shantou, the × side used its main force to advance on Chaoan in three routes along the railway line, capturing Meixi and Anbu in succession. After our courageous counterattack, we once recovered them successively. Then, Caitang and Fuyang were captured by × again on the 25th and 26th. On the morning of the 27th, × launched a joint land and air attack on Chaoan from the southeast in two routes, and a fierce battle broke out between the two sides. The casualties of × were extremely high. After our army extracted a price from ×, it transferred its position.</p>
<p>Zhejiang</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, in the waters of Zhoushan, more than 1,000 people from Dongyue and Cang were trying to land by force under the cover of artillery and advance to the county seat of Dinghai. Our defending army resisted fiercely and a fierce battle broke out. At the same time, a large number of × troops landed in Shenjiamen. By the evening of the 23rd, due to strategic reasons, we voluntarily abandoned the county seat and held the second line of defense, continuing to fight. On the 26th, five × warships, six motorboats, and more than ten civilian ships landed at Kanmenzhen Yaya in Yuhuan. After a head-on attack, more than 200 × were annihilated. The remaining × fled back to the ships in a panic. They came again on the 27th but failed. On the 28th, they greatly reinforced and launched a fierce attack. Because the fortifications were completely destroyed, our army withdrew from Kanmen and is still fighting fiercely. As for the waters outside the mouth of the Min River and the sea off Fuqing, many × ships have also gathered in recent days. On the 26th and 7th, they launched attacks on Chuanshi Island and the Eastern Islands belonging to Pingtan, respectively. Chuanshi Island is an unimportant small rocky mountain (according to yesterday's telegram, × has withdrawn), and our army did not originally defend it, so it fell into the hands of ×. Intense fighting on the Eastern Islands is continuing. The × have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Shanxi</p>
<p>The battle situation in northwestern Shanxi has been quiet for days. Two to three thousand × in eastern Shanxi invaded southward along the Bai Jin Highway. After we met them in Nanguan Fenshuizhen, we inflicted heavy damage on them. The reinforcements of more than two thousand from Taiyuan and Qixian invaded Zou Maling, Quanzhen, and Guhen. They were all recovered after a courageous counterattack. The remaining × fled to the southwest and are still holding each other in Maijiazhuang. In addition, two to three thousand × have been invading southward in recent days, trying to cross the Ping Han Highway, but they have been blocked in the Chenjiazhuang Bizhen area. The × have made no progress. As for southern Jin, our army, after abandoning Gaoluo and Yuanqu last week, began to lure the × into the mountain valleys from the 23rd, launching a fierce attack. The × were overwhelmed and fled in a panic. On the 25th, Yuanqu was captured, and on the 26th, Niaoluo was captured. The × fled to Xiaxian and Wenxi. Our army continued to capture key areas such as Majiashan and has now heavily besieged the ×, stepping up the annihilation. In this battle, more than 20,000 × invaded southward, and more than 2,000 were annihilated within a few days. The elite of the × has been lost and is showing signs of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Other Aspects</p>
<p>In addition, in northern Sui, Kelizu Yingzi was captured, and in southern Hebei, the troops advanced to Zaoqiang, killing three × battalion commanders and a major general. In the battle of Tanbu Lucun in southern Shandong, more than 700 × were killed. In Anhui, the × who attacked north of Anqing were defeated. In eastern Henan, Wuzi and Lichangying were recovered. Machiushi in northern Jiangxi fell into our hands after a fierce battle. The × in Qianjiang, central Hubei, have been besieged for many days and have fled to Tianmen and are about to be recovered. The × occupying Junshan in northern Hunan have also fled to Yueyang. The area has been recovered three times. These are all major war results of the past week, and are specially reported here.</p>
<h3>Young People in Guizhou Province Voluntarily Enlist</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Guiyang, 29th) Jiang Guojing, Jiang Chengye, students from Panxian County, and Jiang Chengzhu, a strong young man, voluntarily requested to join the army. All sectors of the county held a farewell meeting for their enlistment.</p>
<h3>The Military and Civilians of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangsu Issue a Joint Telegram to the Entire Country Expressing Deep Sympathy and Assistance to Compatriots and Foreign Nationals in the Tianjin Concessions</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Central News Agency, 30th] The Party, government, and military authorities, along with people's organizations of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and the Political Department of the ×th War Zone, deeply sympathize with and offer assistance to our compatriots and foreign nationals within the British and French concessions of Tianjin, which are being illegally blockaded by the indignant ××. A joint telegram is being sent to the national press and compatriots, urging unified support. The original telegram is as follows: Urgent. Chongqing Central News Agency please expedite, to all national newspapers and compatriots for your perusal: Since the July 7th Incident, wherever the violent × hooves have reached, they have engaged in arson, ××, pillaging, and looting, revealing their ×××××× nature without restraint. The lives of our people are being trampled upon, causing us to gnash our teeth in pain. We rise up to offer strong resistance. People around the world witness this violent, peace-breaking behavior, and in the spirit of justice, both condemn it and offer assistance. Having met strong resistance militarily and finding themselves isolated diplomatically due to infringing upon the interests of various countries, they become enraged and act even more recklessly. Towards our country, they indiscriminately bomb undefended cities and establish traitorous puppet organizations in an attempt to achieve their goals. Towards other countries, they constantly apply pressure, threatening the lives, property, and legitimate rights of foreign nationals in China. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, blockading the Tianjin concessions, attempting to drive foreign nationals into dire straits. Their intention is nothing more than to use diplomatic offensives to reverse their military decline, on one hand, and to stimulate their domestic public opinion, which is already weary of war, and on the other hand, to cut off foreign aid to us. All of our national compatriots should know that the violent × is a public enemy of world peace and a vermin of human civilization. Our resistance and the assistance of people from all countries arise from a shared sympathy for peace and justice. The blockade of the Tianjin concessions is a direct conflict between justice and peace versus violence. All of our people should, with a shared sense of hatred against the enemy, offer self-help and assist others, expanding the anti-Japanese and pro-foreign national movement. To our compatriots and foreign nationals residing in the British and French concessions of Tianjin, we should extend our deepest sympathy and assistance. To foreign nationals residing in other parts of our country, we should also offer sincere condolences from time to time. There is no need to use national diplomacy to send telegrams to various governments, demanding firm action against Japan. We call on the anti-aggression masses of the world to jointly condemn Japanese × atrocities and boycott Japanese goods. We firmly believe that the calls for world peace and justice, coupled with our country's firm resistance and struggle, will surely achieve great success and inflict severe blows on the aggressors. Today, we are truly at a point where we share the same fate and common interests with the countries of the Pacific. On one hand, we should strengthen our country's resistance. On the other hand, we should unite with peace-loving nations to fight together to ensure that the brutal Japanese militarists are eliminated as soon as possible and that China's independence and world peace are jointly guaranteed. This telegram is sent specifically, hoping for a joint uprising and unified advocacy. With utmost sincerity, the Zhejiang Provincial National Resistance Against × Self-Governance Committee, Frontline Daily, and 23 other groups.</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Propaganda for Military Service Achieves Excellent Results in Guizhou Province, with the People Voluntarily Enlisting</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Central News Agency, 30th] Regarding the propaganda work for military service, since the start of the war of resistance, Party headquarters in various regions have generally followed the instructions of the central government, focusing their efforts on promoting the idea of ​​serving in the military as an honor in society. Therefore, people in various regions have been eager to join the army and fight to kill the ×. Among them, the Guizhou Provincial Military Service Propaganda Office has achieved the most remarkable results. Since receiving the central government's instructions, the provincial Party headquarters has strictly ordered Party headquarters in various counties to gather gentry and actively promote military service based on local conditions, and to concentrate the strength of Party members to do practical work. In particular, Party members with a deeper understanding have taken the lead in complying with military service, influencing the public and creating a trend. Previously, more than 1,000 members of the Tai Bai Township Farmers Association in Xiuwen County were inspired by the propaganda of the county Party headquarters and voluntarily joined the army. The department then mobilized the masses to warmly send them off to show encouragement. More than 100 people continued to join the army voluntarily. Recently, there have been strong young men from Xifeng, Tongzi, Pingba, Pan County, Tianzhu, Guiyang Zhenfeng, Anlong and other counties, dozens to hundreds of people, requesting to join the army voluntarily in an endless stream. In addition, Zhou Benyuan, the principal of Yueying Elementary School in Guiyang, Yang Fusong, the teacher of the elementary school in Tianzhu, and Yu Naide, a student of the middle school in Pingba, have also abandoned their pens and asked to join the army.

Ms. Langstein immediately accelerated, crossed the railway into the Japanese defense zone, and escaped. According to her account after escaping, she was on her way to the Nail Bridge to visit friends when about fifteen Japanese soldiers were engaged in a firefight with guerrillas. The Japanese soldiers opened fire and ordered her to stop. When they saw that she was a foreigner, they did not make things overly difficult for her.</p>
<h3>Internal Strife Within Puppet Organizations Is Intense; Wang Jingwei Unable to Organize Puppet Central Government; Two Puppet Generals to Discuss Merger in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, 29th] Well-informed Chinese sources say that after Wang Jingwei's recent visit to Beiping, it has been decided to establish a new "government" to replace the puppet Reformed Government in Nanjing. As for the puppet Provisional Government in Beiping, it will retain its semi-independent nature. The new organization will be called the "National Government," with Wang as chairman, located in Nanjing, governing the occupied areas south of the sea route. It will continue to use the Kuomintang's Blue Sky White Sun flag, but with the old Five-Color Flag inlaid in the corner. All "anti-Chiang" Kuomintang members will operate within the "National Government." The Japanese army will train Chinese troops for the new "government."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 30th] It is learned here that Wang Jingwei plans to fly from Tokyo to Beiping within 24 hours. In July, the two puppet organizations in Beiping and Nanjing will reportedly meet in Beiping to discuss the organization of a puppet federal government in the Japanese-occupied territories. Wang will attend the meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai Correspondent] The "Reformed Academy" organized by the puppet Reformed Government in Nanjing has decided to adopt "Xin Shenbao" as a textbook for daily reading by the students of the school. It is heard that this decision is intended to develop the students' "correct political thought." It is noted that "Xin Shenbao" is under Japanese control and is known for its anti-British propaganda.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] According to well-informed sources here, it was said last night that the Chinese National Government and the majority of the Chinese people are determined to fight to the end, and all rumors of peace talks, especially that Wang Jingwei has found a preliminary plan for peace talks, are completely unfounded. Currently, all sectors are ignoring such rumors and Wang's proposals for peace. It is said that Wang's plan will inevitably fail in the eyes of the government and other sectors. According to sources here, Wang has returned to Shanghai from Beiping because both puppet governments in Beiping oppose his plan.</p>
<h3>It is Difficult for × Troops to Cross Dongting Lake, a Good Harvest is Expected in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>— Huai Shui</p>
<p>Why did the battle situation in northern Hunan become quiet after the fall of Yueyang? According to our judgment, it is because the × people, based in Yueyang, are deeply afraid of the complex terrain composed of mountains, rivers, lakes, and swamps in northern Hunan, and the thorough destruction of transportation lines such as railways and highways. They would lose the support of their tanks and heavy artillery, which they rely on to win. Therefore, they have to temporarily stop advancing south. Some people have estimated that when the spring water in Dongting Lake rises, the × people are likely to use the navy to go up the river to attack our troops along the river.</p>
<p>After the fall of Nanchang, the troops from Wuchang to Yueyang were particularly busy. The × people threatened to concentrate three divisions of troops in northern Hunan to advance south. Many × ships docked at Yueyang Chenglingji on the shore of Dongting Lake, but according to our intelligence and the people who escaped from the occupied areas, the so-called "reinforcements" were mostly troop movements.</p>
<p>According to an old sailor with twenty years of experience sailing on Dongting Lake, the possibility of × ship activity is very small.</p>
<p>First, the water in Dongting Lake rises quickly, but it also falls quickly.</p>
<p>Second, when the water is high, many sandbars in the lake are submerged, and there is a vast expanse of water everywhere. Even those who sail on Dongting Lake all year round cannot be sure where it is deep and where it is shallow.</p>
<p>Dongting Lake is full of ports, with many waterways. Navigation must be marked with flags to indicate the waterways. Now these flags have been completely destroyed by us, and × ship activity is naturally difficult. Moreover, the only thing the × people can use is small motorboats. Several times, formations of forty or fifty small motorboats, under the cover of a dozen planes, attempted to land at three locations: Sijiao, Jiumazui, and Baxianyuan. Originally, these three locations are all located on the banks of the Xiang River, which are the three points on the peninsula that extends into the heart of the lake. If they could land successfully, they could strike the protruding troops on the Xinqiang River and go up the Xiang River. However, the × people's several attempts were unsuccessful. The ×× division guarding Dongting Chao has five reinforced fortifications and reasonable equipment. Every time the × people attack, several × ships are sunk.</p>
<p>We have now begun to learn to take the initiative to attack, so good news has been frequently reported near Dongting Lake recently!</p>
<p>Due to the lack of troops to allocate, our army sent a large number of guerrillas to attack behind ×, taking advantage of opportunities, causing heavy damage to ×, who had to concentrate their forces on a few important strongholds in an attempt to hold on. Recently, we have repeatedly won victories in the Xinqiang River area, and some troops have been active around Linxiang. The × people are being restrained everywhere, and there is no mention of crossing Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>"If Hubei and Hunan are rich, the world is sufficient." By holding Dongting Lake, we expect a great harvest in Hunan!</p>
<h3>From Baoji to Hanzhong (1)</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>1.  The Peril and Wonder of Highways and Plank Roads</p>
<p>Traveling south from Baoji to Hanzhong, or directly into Sichuan, it is difficult to purchase train tickets because so many people are registered and waiting for passage. Lodgings are in even shorter supply than tickets, with bare earth beds, devoid of all bedding, costing at least eight jiao more. That merchants should so exploit the national crisis is rather lacking in the spirit of reason. Travelers wait long for tickets, and through daily expenses for board and lodging, they soon find themselves without funds, making departure impossible. Yet as the saying goes, misfortune may be a blessing. This is a rising city, where all trades are in need of manpower; failing to travel, one finds work instead, sometimes easier than buying a ticket. Two female students of obstetrics and gynecology, witnessing a pregnant woman give birth on the street with no shelter, had an inspiration. They borrowed some capital from the county magistrate and founded an obstetrics hospital. In less than six months, the business was thriving, and a vagrant woman was transformed into a renowned doctor.</p>
<p>Thanks to a friend's help, the reporter was able to depart early on the third day. That day, the number of passenger cars and military vehicles (transporting wounded and disabled soldiers) traveling together was as many as thirty or forty, stretching continuously for more than ten li, a truly magnificent sight. Leaving Xuan City, we crossed the Wei River and gradually entered the mountains, circling upward to ascend the Qin Mountains (the ancient Dasanguan Pass). The grandeur of the mountain range and the tortuous route are both awe-inspiring and invigorating. Reaching the summit, we descended again, with clear streams, free from the muddy color of the Wei River, accompanying us on both the sunny and shady sides of the mountains. The forests are lush and green, reminiscent of the scenery of the south. Some say that southern Shaanxi is not typical of the Northwest, and there seems to be a distinct geographical basis for this.</p>
<p>The highway traveled by the vehicles mostly utilizes ancient plank roads. The plank road from Shiji to Baocheng is the Lianyun Plank Road, also known as the Northern Plank Road. Further south from Baocheng, passing through Ningqiang and entering Sichuan through Yuan, Zhaohua, and Jianzhou, is the Southern Plank Road. Both the Northern and Southern Plank Roads are located in towering mountains. In ancient times, the facilities were simple, and construction must have been extremely difficult. Reading Zhuge Wuhou's letter to his brother Jin, "Zhao Zilong retreated and burned more than one hundred li of the covered road north of Chiya. One end of the covered beam is in the mountains, and the other end is supported by pillars in the water. Now the water is high and swift, making it impossible to fix the pillars," one can imagine the challenges. Wuhou marched his troops through Xiegu Valley (in Mei County; Wuhou followed Baocheng [now Chenggu], which was over two hundred li shorter to Chang'an than Xiegu), and the plank bridges and covered roads numbered as many as five thousand. If all the Northern and Southern Plank Roads were counted together, the significance of the engineering feat would probably not be less than that of today's Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway.</p>
<p>Today, the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway is built, and cars come and go, much faster than using wooden oxen and flowing horses on the plank road, but the route is thousands of li long, and much of it passes through deep mountains and dangerous ravines, suddenly rising to the clouds, suddenly descending into a deep valley. The "one man at the pass, ten thousand cannot pass" strategic points are truly endless. In terms of modern offensive and defensive tactics, once the slope is destroyed or the bridge is broken, the attacker must travel long distances and cannot easily use heavy weapons, while the defender can resist layer by layer, making full use of the effectiveness of various new weapons, and it is certain that victory will be achieved. Wang Jingwei betrayed the country and surrendered to the enemy, rashly flattering the enemy: invading Hanzhong and threatening Sichuan! He obviously does not understand the geographical characteristics of Sichuan and Hanzhong, which is no different from an idiot talking in his sleep!</p>
<p>Traveling on and on, driving down the Qin Mountains, we walked a long and relatively flat dam (called Chuanba in the north), which is Fengxian County. Between Liuba and Fengxian, we had to climb up Fengling again, and then the white clouds touched the sky, and we had to go up another level to pass through the Chaiguan Ridge with trembling flesh and a throbbing heart. The scenery along the way is extremely dangerous, especially when arriving at the high hill, with temples in front and behind, watching dozens of cars winding and descending on the surface, like gray butterflies chasing each other, lively and vivacious in the beautiful green forest and Taoxi.</p>
<p>There is a small town under the ridge, named Miaotaizi, where the "Han Zhang Huanhou Temple" is built. It is said that it also enshrines Marquis Liu, so it is also called the Liu Hou Shrine. On the west mountain peak of the shrine is the place where Zifang fasted (there is also a Zhang Liang Temple on the Qinling Mountains), with ancient pines and cypresses, and the forests are especially beautiful.</p>
<p>From here, both sides of the highway are ten-thousand-foot-high hills, with a river in the middle. The car follows its bank, moving forward gently. The river becomes more and more rapid, and the line of sight becomes narrower and narrower. At about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, the sunlight is blocked by the mountains.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, there is a high peak, the mountain is steeper, and its shape is slightly like a chicken's head. This is the ancient battlefield of Jitou Pass (formerly known as Qipanling). The ridge is full of jagged rocks, and those who climb it are like climbing a cloud ladder. The plank road passes on the right bank through the Jianmen Gate. The highway crosses the bridge and walks on the left bank, and also has to chisel a stone cave to pass through. The aforementioned Northern Plank Road ends here. The plank road burned by Xiao He also refers to this line. During the Chu-Han Contention, Emperor Gao was besieged by Hegemon King at Jitou Pass. There is a local land temple on the pass, which is said to enshrine the old man who gave Emperor Gao water to drink at that time. Also, there are "Thirteen Kinds of Ancient Posts in Shimen" engraved on the stone wall, including Cao Cao's handwriting, which is famous in the art world.</p>
<p>Leaving the pass, it suddenly opens up, and it is all a boundless wheat field. Although mountains are also faintly visible all around, they are already hundreds of miles away. This is the Hanzhong area that the traitors Han Fuju and Wang Jingwei have been thinking about. However, this place is not the boundary of Nanzheng (i.e., Hanzhong) County, but the jurisdiction of Baocheng County. The river that flows out with us is called Baocheng River, or Zijin River, or Heilongjiang, flowing south to join the Han River, going east to Xiangfan, also known as Xianghe, and then joining the Yangtze River at Hankou.</p>
<p>Baocheng is located on the right bank of the pass (i.e., the west bank of the Baocheng River). The civil houses and the construction of new factories can be seen one by one. The county is establishing a memorial tower for the martyrs of the war of resistance on the main road. In front of it stands a wooden archway, and the car passes through it. Looking up, there are words saying: "The Japanese bandits are not eliminated, and the warriors are ashamed to enter this door!" Looking back, it says: "This is the road for the anti-Japanese heroes to advance!" This is very encouraging and alert, especially when viewed by the brave soldiers marching north to kill the bandits.

<h3>Germany Intensifies Military Preparations; Situation in Danzig Serious; Polish President Addresses Nation to Defend Territory and Expand Navy</h3>
<p>[Warsaw Central News Agency, 29th] It has just been learned here that 4,000 Germans secretly entered the Free City of Danzig last night from East Prussia in many trucks to join the volunteer corps organized by the Danzig National Socialist Party. The Polish government, considering the situation serious, is rushing to build defenses along the Danzig area. A defense line of about 20 kilometers has already been built from Gdynia to Danzig. In addition, most of the Polish Navy's warships, including some torpedo boats, have also been concentrated in the waters of Gdynia. However, most people believe that German leader Hitler will not act rashly and use force to seize the Free City of Danzig, which would lead to war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] According to semi-official reports from Danzig received here tonight, weapons and personnel continue to be transported from East Prussia to Danzig. On Wednesday night, sixteen cannons were loaded onto tugboats in a bay east of Danzig and transported to Biskupiec. The Danzig authorities are currently working hard to build strong gun emplacements there. A barracks on a small hill has also been converted into an arsenal, and the hill is heavily guarded. It is reported that hundreds of stormtroopers have arrived in Danzig, and Nazis from East Prussia are forming volunteer corps, now residing in pre-war underground fortifications.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] Officials here strongly deny that German troops have entered Danzig or are forming volunteer corps there. They only acknowledge that Danzig is currently strengthening its peaceful strength within legal limits and is only recruiting Danzig citizens. The motive for this is due to the "reckless and irresponsible behavior" of Polish officials and other elements in the "corridor." According to official news from Danzig, some kind of event is clearly taking place in Danzig, and the situation is deteriorating. However, the claim of German troop movements has not been verified.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 30th] The Polish National "Maritime and Colonial League" initiated a national "Ocean Week." Polish President Mościcki delivered a radio address to the nation on the 29th. Mościcki spoke of the importance of Danzig to Poland, stating that the close connection between Danzig and Poland has existed for hundreds of years, and that Danzig and Gdynia account for four-fifths of Poland's international trade. The two ports are not only Poland's gateway to the sea, but also the anchorage for merchant ships from various countries. As the nation celebrates the "Fisherman's Festival," the nation's attention is focused on Danzig and Gdynia, while also remembering the soldiers who protect our Polish maritime rights. He also pointed out that "Pomerania and the Polish Baltic coast are the nation's supreme treasures, inextricably linked to the lives of the people. The louder the enemy's calls, the stronger Poland's will to sacrifice to defend its territory. Poland has restored its independence and built a new country on the shores of the Baltic Sea, bringing peace and labor together. Today's Polish people have not wasted their precious time. The pain of being despised in the past has been mostly eliminated. The work we are carrying out today will continue, not only for the sake of Poland but also for the benefit of countries that have economic or cultural ties with Poland. However, the world we live in today is a world of military competition, and there is a danger of conflict in the Baltic Sea region. Poland wants to maintain peace and order, so Poland's naval power must be increased. The National Maritime and Colonial League has received sufficient donations to build a new submarine, which will be named 'Orzeł.'" Finally, he added that "Poland's air force is strong, and it is hoped that the navy will not lag behind, enough to carry out the mission of a 'maritime power.'"</p>
<h3>Halifax Speech: England and France Resist Aggression; Germany's Forceful Claims Lead to Isolation; Hope for Early Success in Anglo-Soviet Negotiations; England Decides to Accept Soviet Demands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The British government has already decided to accept all of Moscow's demands. According to sources with inside knowledge of diplomatic circles here, relayed by the Haitong News Agency, the British government's confidence in the future of negotiations with Moscow is based on the following reality: the final instructions issued to Ambassador Seeds and Special Envoy Strang almost entirely accept Soviet demands. England and France are now prepared to include the names of the Baltic countries, which had previously been explicitly rejected, and other neutral countries in the mutual guarantee treaty. It is said that Luxembourg is among these neutral countries, having been requested for inclusion by France. Regarding the Baltic countries, only one point remains unresolved: how to deal with the situation if one of these countries changes its relationship with neighboring countries due to internal political changes. However, London does not consider this difficulty to be particularly serious, as Ambassador Seeds has received instructions with full authority to accommodate Soviet demands, even if these demands exceed the scope of the latest proposals, as long as the alliance can be established quickly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Foreign Secretary Halifax (see photo) delivered a speech at the Royal Institute today, saying: "If further acts of aggression occur, we are determined to fulfill our obligations to resist with all our strength. There are certain nations whose people, holding a different international philosophy, do not hesitate to distort the truth and misrepresent our actions and motives. We learn of these things, knowing them to be untrue, and knowing that even those who spread these rumors know them to be untrue. Therefore, we find them particularly despicable. All these facts of injury to free people are deeply noted here. Britain will never be cowed by rumors or force. In this degenerate age, many surprising events occur. Our purpose having been defamed by slander, it seems we should resolutely make a clear statement. Our initial determination is to limit aggression, and for this reason, we have allied with other countries to deal with this common crisis. The sole purpose of this measure is self-defense, but unfortunately, it has been regarded as a policy of isolation and a deliberate attempt to encircle Germany and Italy and hinder their search for living space. But what is the truth? Germany can truly be said to have achieved self-isolation successfully. Economically, its policy is monopolistic; politically, its policy is causing unrest throughout the world; culturally, its policy is racialism. These are all paths to self-isolation. Since Germany is striving to isolate itself, how can it blame others? As for Germany and Italy's claim that we are cutting off their search for 'living space,' it is even more inexplicable.</p>
<p>Occupying land by force is by no means a way to solve the problem of 'living space.' It is necessary to cultivate good internal governance and harmonious international relations to approach a solution. But what we must pay attention to is that when Germany makes this demand, its own country is welcoming foreign immigrants, recruiting a large number of Czech, Dutch, and Italian workers to meet the needs of its industry and agriculture. On what basis, then, does Germany claim to be overpopulated? In fact, countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and the British Isles can be said to be overpopulated, but we can still solve this problem through production and work. Economically, the relations between countries in the world are like weaving, extremely close. Therefore, no country can attempt to harm its neighbors for its own benefit. If we proceed through cooperation, the opportunities to satisfy the economic life of all countries are plentiful, and the so-called 'living space' can be solved at once. If the world is organized in this way, then Germany and Italy will not have to fear for their own security. However, no one can establish an international society by force. While living, fearing the violence of others on one hand, and using all their resources on defense on the other, there can be no peace. To make calls for peace is truly empty words, unless disarmament is implemented as a guarantee, and the right of other countries to enjoy their freedom is truly recognized. As of today, militarism has blocked the path to resolution. The whole world is filled with jealousy, hatred, malice, and harshness. If the advocacy of force can be abolished, so that the terror of war no longer exists in the world, then all unresolved problems will be easily solved. At this time, countries can openly discuss political and economic difficulties, whether they are of an international nature or colonial issues. However, if the responsible spokesperson of a country's government constantly refers to its friendly nations as thieves or conspirators, and slanders Britain's world policy, then it will be difficult for Britain to negotiate with it. The British government's commitment lies in restoring confidence in all countries, and the second step is to rebuild an</p>
<p>international order, making it reach a broader and more solid foundation." After Halifax discussed the League of Nations and its covenant, he said, "Unless there is an organization whose function is sufficient to achieve peaceful transitions, it is insufficient to merely seek ways to prevent changes to the status quo by force. Our foreign policy, in addition to dealing with current events, extends to the future. British policy has two basic principles: one is the determination to resist force, and the other is to</p>
<p>recognize the intentions of the world and carry out construction work to establish peace. In today's atmosphere of war clouds, Britain's most direct task is still to resist aggression. I would like to make a solemn statement on this so as not to be misunderstood by others. If we can dispel misunderstandings and obtain solutions, we must not merely make empty words, but must use concrete facts to make the whole world believe it. Whether giving or taking, both sides must act with concrete actions, and must not merely exchange substantial gains for empty promises." Before Halifax delivered the above speech, he had discussed the agreements established with Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania, and expressed the hope that</p>
<p>Anglo-Soviet negotiations could be completed soon. In conclusion, Halifax said, "Our obligations to Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania have absolutely achieved mutual understanding. We deeply know that if other countries lose their security and independence, then the security and independence of Britain will also suffer serious threats. Our military expansion preparations are progressing day by day. In political, administrative, and industrial aspects, it is enough to prove that the government's efforts have obtained the support of the public opinion of the entire country. If international law and world order must be maintained, then we must be prepared to</p>
<p>fight for international security. In addition to military strength, Britain also has a united people and abundant resources."</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Mockery</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th] Today, the newspapers here are all mocking Halifax's speech, which is enough to show the reaction of German political circles to the British Foreign Secretary's words. The 'Berlin Times' praised the British Foreign Secretary as 'the respectable old Halifax,' and criticized his speech, saying that the British Foreign Secretary made mistakes in his propaganda aimed at restoring British prestige: (1) believing that unreasonable debates can be repeatedly supported; (2) underestimating the common sense and observation of people outside its sphere of influence, especially for Germans, otherwise the British Foreign Secretary's explanation of Britain's position, like Britain's past policy of maintaining a balance of power, interfering with the freedom of European countries, will be impossible to obtain an explanation." It was learned here that the British Foreign Secretary's speech was delayed, so most newspapers did not have time to write comments. In addition to the 'Berlin Times,' only the 'Deutsche Zeitung' commented on the speech, saying, 'Halifax's attempt to attribute the intention of self-isolation to Germany has obviously failed miserably. Germany is not isolated among the countries of the world, and its policies have won the trust of neutral neighbors. The British Foreign Secretary's speech is a hesitant and self-contradictory speech, and does not match its guarantee of peaceful intentions,' it said.</p>
<h3>Singapore Conference: Successfully Completed; Chamberlain Reports in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in response to a question from Labor MP Henderson in the House of Commons today, said that he could not report the details of the Singapore Joint Defense Conference, and only said that the conference had been extremely successful. Henderson also asked whether cooperative measures for the Anglo-French Far East Allied Forces would be stipulated in the event of war in the Far East. Chamberlain said that this was one of the main topics discussed at the conference.</p>
<h3>British Supply Department Bill Passes Second Reading in the House of Lords</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] The House of Lords passed the second reading of the Supply Department Bill today.</p>
<h3>British Empire Press Union Meets in London</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] At a meeting of the British Empire Press Union today, Chen Yifan, a representative of the Hong Kong press, said that Hong Kong</p>
<p>believed that the Tianjin and Shanghai issues were only a prelude to an attack on Hong Kong. If any concrete concessions were made to Japan, further infringement by Japan on the rights of the Hong Kong press would be inevitable, he said.</p>
<h3>US Congress Passes Continued Purchase of Foreign Silver; Maintains President's Devaluation Power</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] The US Senate and House of Representatives held a joint meeting yesterday and decided to continue to maintain the President's power to devalue the US dollar and the Treasury Department's power to purchase foreign silver.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] Yesterday's joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives decided that the price of domestically newly minted silver would be 70 cents per ounce. The bill must first be passed by both houses before it can be sent to the White House.</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Delivers Speech</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the press today, "The Treasury Department will adjust the price of foreign silver based on the London silver market to prevent foreigners from dumping large amounts of silver. Foreign merchants expect the United States to completely stop buying foreign silver, but whether the United States will continue to buy silver from abroad will depend on the final decision of Congress on the monetary bill. If Congress decides to raise the price of domestic silver, the government will levy a 50% silver profit tax on American silver sellers. This tax was previously applied to foreign silver speculators. I believe that if the US government stops using the foreign exchange equalization fund and cancels the power to devalue the US dollar, it will lead to a serious situation. If the government's power to deal with finance cannot be maintained, the Treasury Department may still have some power to deal with the foreign exchange market, but it is impossible to know how much success it will achieve," he said.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] After the US Treasury Department repeatedly lowered the set price for purchasing foreign silver, the silver price here fell another three-quarters of a penny per ounce. Whether the US financial authorities will continue to lower the silver price on the evening of the 29th is something that people in the market here are generally looking forward to. According to the observation of a certain person in the financial community, the silver price will not fall below 18 pence per ounce, and he believes that the fall in the silver price is enough to constitute a powerful weapon to deal with Japan. The US authorities may use it to urge Japan to take a more moderate attitude, it is not known, he said.</p>
<h3>US Neutrality Legislation: House of Representatives to Vote</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Regarding the Neutrality Act issue, the amendment proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, "advocating the abolition of the current provisions regarding the arms embargo and authorizing the President to designate belligerent countries and war zones," is currently being continuously discussed by the House of Representatives. Democratic Congressman Shanley said that it would be better to have no Neutrality Act than to enact an imperfect one. Republican congressmen applauded in approval. Republican Congressman Barra said that any Neutrality Act is difficult to perfect. We will never allow a single American soldier to go abroad to fight (congressmen applauded warmly). He also said that if we ban the transport of arms to England and France after a war breaks out, and London and Paris are subjected to air raids, public opinion will be opposed to the embargo measure, and it will be difficult to resist. Judging from yesterday's discussion results, most congressmen advocate restoring international law, maintaining the original state of neutrality, and still allowing arms to be transported to belligerent countries, while completely abolishing the current Neutrality Act, only maintaining the current measures for monitoring and licensing arms exports. If this important amendment is accepted by the House of Representatives, then the possibility of extending credit loans to belligerent countries will still exist, and the arms embargo measure will inevitably be canceled. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on it tomorrow. The Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee will first meet to decide their attitude before the House of Representatives convenes.</p>
<h3>German Economics Minister To Visit Holland; To Hold Economic Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 30th) The German Economics Minister, Funk, will travel to Holland next week to stay for several days, to reciprocate the visit to Germany by the former Dutch Economics Minister, Steipe. Dr. Funk will arrive in the Hague on Wednesday of next week, and leave on Friday. He will meet with the President of the Dutch National Bank, and will hold economic negotiations of a general nature with the Dutch authorities.</p>
<h3>China Invites British Labor Leaders To Come East For Inspection</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The Chinese labor community recently</p>
<p>invited the National Executive Committee of the British Labor Movement (formed by the various Labor Party factions, the Labor Party Executive Committee, and the Trades Union Congress Executive Committee) to send a delegation to China to inspect the current situation.</p>
<h3>Siam Denies Request For English And French Guarantees</h3>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Paris, 30th) The Siamese Embassy in France issued a press release denying that the country would have requested English and French guarantees. The press release stated, "The foreign policy of the Siamese government lies in the development of friendship with all countries, treating all equally, without partiality. There has been no change to date."</p>
<h3>America Pays Close Attention To Overseas Situation</h3>
<p>Hull And Dutch Ambassador Had Lengthy Talk [Reuters, Washington, 29th] US Secretary of State Hull had lunch with President Roosevelt at the White House today and reported to the President on the recent overseas situation, focusing on Danzig and China. Prior to this, Hull had a lengthy conversation with the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, who will soon return home for vacation.</p>
<h3>Slovakian Delegation Arrives in Germany</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th] A Slovakian delegation, led by Special Envoy Plik, arrived here on Thursday to hold negotiations with the German government.

<h3>Japanese × New Strategy</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from Guilin, the new Japanese × strategy for invading China is as follows: (1) main offensive against Jinshan; (2) supporting offensive against central Hubei; (3) feigned offensive against Hunan and Jiangxi; (4) naval guerrilla attacks against South China; (5) continued mopping-up operations against southern Shanxi and northern Jiangsu; (6) "clearing" guerrillas in central China within a time limit; (7) occupying eastern Zhejiang by early July. It is expected that there is a considerable basis for this ×, but we should also have the following basic understandings of the future predatory strategies of the × people:</p>
<p>(1) At present, the main purpose of ×× operations is to cooperate with political and economic offensives, focusing on consolidating the rule of the occupied areas, so as to use our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to nurture the Japanese army to conquer China.</p>
<p>(2) × may adopt a main offensive posture against Jinshan, but the purpose is still to consolidate the occupied areas, and mop up guerrillas and their bases; therefore, we must recognize that if Jinshan is in danger, the overall situation will be affected, and the recent hard battles and great victories on the western front are actually the main reason for the southwest to obtain stability.</p>
<p>(3) ×'s manpower is now increasingly dispersed, and it feels increasingly insufficient. It can only rely on the mobility of its troops to carry out jumping operations, on the one hand deliberately cultivating our sense of "security" in the southwest, loosening our active anti-Japanese emotions, turning the protracted war into a dragging war, and on the other hand consolidating and expanding the occupied areas, raising troops to prepare to "conquer all of China in one go"!</p>
<p>(4) Therefore, we must be seriously vigilant today, follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang, strive for initiative, and fight the overall anti-Japanese war. Only an active, comprehensive, and protracted war can break the Japanese's new tricks and new conspiracies!</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Naval Issue: Germany Will Reply To British Memorandum; Hitler To Give Speech Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] Germany will reply to the British memorandum on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement at an "appropriate time." This reply will be conducted through diplomatic means, as the document is mostly technical issues and is not suitable for Hitler to answer in his speech. According to opinions in political circles, if Hitler speaks in Bremen on Saturday, it will not be a major political speech. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson will return to London next Tuesday for a week's vacation. It is expected that Germany will still not be able to send a reply at that time. German political circles also stated that there is mutual suspicion between Britain and Germany. Germany cannot believe Britain's words of willingness to reconcile unless Britain changes its government. Germany is unwilling to talk with it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] Reuters learned that Hitler may go to Bremen tomorrow to preside over the launching of a warship and deliver a speech. It is generally believed that Hitler should rest before dealing with the expected major events that will arrive in the summer, so he will not participate in any unnecessary gatherings. Moreover, Hitler knows that his speech is extremely important to the world, so the time and place for delivering the speech must be carefully considered. If he speaks tomorrow because of the warship launching, he will inevitably mention the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, but he is currently unwilling to issue a formal German reply to England.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Negotiations Set To Begin In Tokyo On The 6th; Commercial Activity Still Suspended In The British Concession</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th] Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin issue will begin in Tokyo on the 7th (or 6th). According to reports in the Japanese newspapers, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Tanaka, a representative from the Japanese Tianjin</p>
<p>Office, and the British Vice-Consul in Tianjin will discuss "local" events in Tianjin at this meeting. The</p>
<p>Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, will negotiate with the Japanese Foreign Minister's representative Kato on the "basic Chinese issues that affect the Tianjin incident." The Asahi Shimbun commented on this matter, saying, "Japan</p>
<p>The attitude of Britain in North China is to concretely implement its abandonment of Qin's policy and change its basic policies."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] Regarding the Tianjin incident, England and Japan have already decided to negotiate in Tokyo. Generally speaking, the Japanese government</p>
<p>will wait until the British and Japanese consuls in Tianjin arrive in Tokyo before starting negotiations. The date will be in the middle of next week.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Army Minister Itagaki and Navy Minister Yonai for a long time yesterday to discuss the demands that the Japanese side will put forward in the future negotiations between the Japanese representative and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie as conditions for resolving the Tianjin issue. It is reported that the Japanese representative will be Kato, an advisor to the Japanese Embassy in "Manchukuo," and Toshihide Tashiro, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin. The Japanese cabinet met yesterday and decided to promote Kato to the rank of minister. As before, when negotiating in Tianjin, Kato was also the Japanese representative. He only flew to Tokyo yesterday, while the Tianjin Consul-General Tashiro has already been here for a long time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Tianjin foreign dispatch, the New Zealand Honorary Consul in Tianjin, Davis, passed freely through the entrance of the racecourse today, and did not encounter any</p>
<p>difficulties, which proves that the Japanese army has complied with the orders of the Japanese army commander. British and other businesses within the British concession are still in a state of suspension. A British expatriate said that Japan now has the possibility of a large-scale war with the Soviet Union, so there is hope for a resolution of the Tianjin issue between England and Japan. Another British banker said that it is absolutely impossible for Britain to cooperate with the Joint Reserve Bank of North China.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The only English newspaper here, the Hankou Free Press, criticized Anglo-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese relations in its article yesterday, saying, "The true purpose of the Japanese army provoking the Mongolian-Manchurian border incident is extremely clear. The Japanese are now trying to expel British forces in China. If the Japanese cannot be sure that the Soviet Union will strictly adhere to a neutral attitude, they will not dare to break with England. Furthermore, the act of sending planes to bomb Outer Mongolia is actually to test the Soviet Union's attitude. If the Soviet Union really wants to go to war with Japan, it can use this as an excuse. Therefore, Japanese newspapers all understand the Soviet Union's intentions and can predict the attitude the Soviet Union will take once England and Japan go to war."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] Labor MP Baker asked Undersecretary of State Butler today, "The Japanese authorities in Shantou prevented the two ships, 'Western Star' and 'Guangdong,' from entering the port, forcibly occupied the Swire wharf, and tore down the British flag. The Japanese commander in Tianjin also stated that he would intensify the blockade of the concession. What is the situation regarding these events?" Undersecretary of State Butler replied, "The British ships will not sail to Shantou after being advised by the local British naval authorities. Obstacles have been placed near the Swire wharf, but it has not yet been occupied. According to the information received by Foreign Secretary Halifax, he cannot confirm the tearing down of the British flag or the intensification of the blockade of the Tianjin concession. Also, Henderson asked, 'Now that negotiations are underway, is it possible to ease the blockade situation in Tianjin?' The Undersecretary replied, 'This is very possible. The Foreign Office cannot officially confirm the Japanese military authorities' declaration of intensifying the blockade.'"</p>
<h3>US Chief of Staff Proposes Defense Plan; Expand Army To Prepare Outpost Line; General Craig To Retire Soon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] US Chief of Staff General Craig, before his impending retirement, proposed a defense plan, which is divided into three points, including the establishment of five elite divisions, to quickly repel any attacks by the × people on the Western Hemisphere in the event of an emergency. The army now needs to increase officers by 2,800 and soldiers by 23,000 to expand the existing four divisions and establish a fifth division. Other key points of the plan include preparing outpost defense lines in Alaska, Hawaii, Panama, and Puerto Rico, which can be used immediately, and organizing a reserve army to expand the current army to one million people.</p>

<h3>Weather Station</h3>
<p>Tokyo, is the peace talk; Tianjin, then intensifies the blockade! This two-man act is performed wonderfully and unusually. What on the stage isn’t the red-faced character and the white-faced character? We very much hold others’ worries, Mr. Herbert. When flying back to Tianjin from Tokyo, will he be able to pass through that gate?</p>
<p>A message for our British friends: quickly stop being fooled by the Japanese. Only an “armored</p>
<p>Head” can soften them. The British have an old saying: “We can endure until the last minute, and only the last minute is the key to victory.” We hope that the last minute will not come too late!</p>
<p>The British Foreign Minister’s speech stated that if another act of aggression occurs internationally, we will use all our strength to fulfill our obligations. How wide is this step?</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: Chen Yifan, a well-known figure in the Chinese art world, said in a speech at the Imperial Press Association today that the concession incidents in Tianjin and Shanghai are a prelude to future Japanese military invasions of Hong Kong. If so, if the British government retreats step by step regarding the concession incidents, then it will be difficult to avoid the Japanese military interfering in Hong Kong's freedom of speech. Believe it or not.</p>
<h3>World Curiosities: A Chimpanzee Son</h3>
<p>In Paris, a famous veterinarian, Dr. Menard, has announced an unprecedented experiment in psychological education:</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when Dr. Menard was on an expedition to the Philippines, he captured a young chimpanzee, only two years old, in the jungle. He brought it back home and named it "Faton." Dr. Menard, his wife, and their two sons did their best to make "Faton" forget that it was originally an animal. That is, they treated it exactly like a human, allowing it to grow up, but without formally teaching or training it, relying entirely on the natural laws of development to lead it from an animal's life into human society.</p>
<p>"Faton" first met the public at a grand banquet recently held by Dr. Menard. He invited many famous psychologists, doctors, and journalists to his home. After everyone was seated, the door to the dining room opened, and "Faton," dressed neatly, walked into the room on his hind legs, just like a human. He closed the door behind him and waited for an introduction. He politely shook hands with each guest, but his face showed no expression. Then, he found the last seat at the end of the table and sat down. He ate his portion of food without making the slightest mistake. The dinner served to him was exactly the same as everyone else's, with soup, fish, meat, vegetables, and dessert. He calmly accepted the dishes from his neighbor, took a little for himself, and passed them on to others. He ate cleanly. The only difference during the meal was that he took a little more vegetables and fruit than others. He held his wine glass and drank wine in a dignified manner, not gulping it down in one go, but politely sipping it from time to time. When dessert was served, he suddenly got up, walked to Mrs. Menard, affectionately put his arms around her shoulders, and clearly called out, "Mama, Mama!" Then, he pointed playfully at a bottle of white wine, because he recognized the label. It was his favorite, and he wanted a glass. As they were drinking coffee, Dr. Menard said, "We should have a smoke." Without being told, "Faton" skillfully walked over, opened a cabinet, took out a box of cigars, and then took out several kinds of cigarettes, distributing them one by one to the guests, lighting them for each person, not forgetting anyone. Finally, he lit a cigarette for himself. With an ashtray in hand, he sat down comfortably and smoked. When he finished, he put the butt in the ashtray and extinguished it.</p>
<p>This chimpanzee was wearing a comfortable new shirt, light-colored trousers, and canvas shoes. He had his own bedroom, with a table, a rocking chair, a bed, a wardrobe, and a specially made tiled bathtub. He turned on the tap himself, tested the water temperature, and then washed his face before drying himself and getting dressed, just like a human. He wandered freely around the house, without breaking anything. He did not sneak into the pantry without permission. When Dr. Menard did not speak to him, he was honest and quiet, unlike other animals, without any of that restless energy.</p>
<p>After the meal, Dr. Menard explained his experiment to the guests, specifically stating: "Faton" had not received any chimpanzee training in a circus. Every action this chimpanzee performed had been recorded. The whole family had never specifically trained him to do anything. For ten years, he had grown into a "person," receiving the same guidance as his two sons, treated equally. He learned to open doors, open boxes, turn on light switches, and eat with knives, forks, and spoons on his own initiative. However, "Faton" only knew how to say one word, "Mama!" He learned this from the two children. Therefore, Dr. Menard concluded that the word "Mama" is the most basic language of mankind, the same in any language in the world. This is the easiest sound for a chimpanzee to pronounce, because it is a sound that can be heard naturally with only two openings and closings of the mouth.</p>
<p>Do you find this strange? The history of animals evolving into humans in thousands of years can be completed within ten years.</p>
<h3>Ghost</h3>
<p>Old Mrs. Li was very afraid of ghosts. One day, she went to visit relatives. At night, she was invited to stay in a very remote and quiet room. After Mrs. Li and the others had settled down, she hurriedly closed the windows and bolted the door, but then she heard a voice from the bed saying: "Mrs. Li! Don't be afraid, now there are only two of us in the room."</p>
<h3>Rare News</h3>
<p>Tibet only publishes one newspaper. The editor is a Protestant missionary named Ashbolt. Not long ago, Ashbolt traveled from Tibet to Europe and told reporters that he runs Tibet's only newspaper in a small village 10,000 feet above sea level. He is solely responsible for editing, printing, and distribution. The printing press is a small hand-operated printing press that prints only fifty copies each time. The subscribers are all local lamas, because only lamas in Tibet can read. However, as soon as the lamas receive the newspaper, they immediately gather the residents to explain the news in the newspaper. Therefore, although this newspaper only sells fifty copies, it has more than 100,000 "readers."</p>

<p>Yesterday's question was to trick the children, I believe the ladies and gentlemen were not fooled, the answer is as follows: Tom walked around the piano five times, Tom walked around John five times, but Tom's parrot did not turn, the parrot and the piano turned five times, the parrot and John turned five times, and the parrot and Tom naturally still did not move.

<h3>Yuhua</h3>
<p>Judge: This child has committed theft five times already. You should teach him well.</p>

<p>A: When praying, why do you always ask for daily bread, not a lifetime of bread?</p>
<p>B: Because rice rots easily if it's stored for too long!</p>
<h3>One a Day</h3>
<p>This place was originally "One Person a Day," but now an umbrella also wants to squeeze into the crowd.</p>
<p>That is no ordinary umbrella. It has been the center of attention in the world. It has been to Munich, appeasing Hitler; it has been to Rome, conveying friendship to Mussolini.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the umbrella's background. Its canopy is made of black silk, and its handle is brown, inlaid with a golden band. It weighs one and a half pounds and costs fifty-seven shillings and sixpence, which is not cheap.</p>
<p>Although this umbrella was sold at the Bailey Bridge store near James Palace, it was manufactured in a little-known factory with four male and two female workers. Every stitch on the umbrella was sewn by hand, and every button was ordered by hand.</p>
<p>Although this umbrella was often taken for repairs, it was never actually opened and used. Perhaps it was worn out from too much traveling. Now the shadow of an umbrella has arrived in the Far East. Let's wait and see!</p>
<h3>Sea Adventures of Lawton</h3>
<p>— By Captain —, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>(Previous summary: In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator, and Bill, the mechanic, of the Choukes Shipping Company, took the paddle steamer "Kebrongqi" to travel to Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war, and a British warship was coming to intercept the ship. The ship fled frantically. Soon, it encountered an iceberg and British warship fire. With great difficulty, it escaped from the tiger's mouth and returned to the American territory of the White Sea. Jack and Bill returned to New York and saw Mr. Choukes. Choukes then asked them to take the "Saint Uke" to Europe to find his son.)</p>
<p>"Please send this out as soon as possible," he said, handing the letter to Jack.</p>
<p>When his eyes looked at the young telegraph operator, he showed a sense of familiarity, but the two young men did not pay attention. Bill was indifferent to this matter, but Jack frowned and looked at the letter. It was in code, addressed to a place in New York, and signed Martin Johnson.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry, Mr. Johnson," Jack said, "we cannot send this letter for you."</p>
<p>"Cannot? Why can't you?" the passenger said angrily.</p>
<p>"Because it's in code."</p>
<p>"What does that matter?"</p>
<p>"We have orders that in wartime, we cannot send coded telegrams. Anything not written directly and clearly in English cannot be sent."</p>
<p>"This is truly absurd," he said, even more displeased, "I'm telling you, this is a commercial letter."</p>
<p>"If you can write it clearly in English, I can forward it," Jack said.</p>
<p>The man suddenly leaned forward, his hand reached into his pocket, and he immediately took out a roll of paper.</p>
<p>"Can I have a word with you in private?" he asked, his eyes darting towards Bill.</p>
<p>"Whatever you want to say, you can say it in front of my friend," Jack said.</p>
<p>"Well, look here—there's a hundred dollars in this roll," he threw it on the desk, "as long as you temporarily forget about the code rules, it's yours."</p>
<p>"Look, Mr. Johnson," Jack said righteously, "I've already told you our orders. As for your money, even if it were a million, it would be the same to me."</p>
<p>"Humph! You're a fool," the man said furiously, grabbing the roll of money, crumpling the letter in his hand, and storming out of the cabin.</p>
<p>"That evil kid again," he muttered as he walked onto the deck, "this will only give me another chance to settle the score with him. These American guys are all fools. Well, if I can't find a way in the radio room, at worst, Von Kerton won't get the report in New York."</p>
<p>"Hey," Bill asked after the black-bearded man left, "can you figure out who that guy is?"</p>
<p>"Who, Johnson?" Jack said lazily, "What, right. You now realize that there's a bit of familiarity in his voice and eyes, but in my life, I don't want to know him."</p>
<p>"I don't want to either, but I feel like I've met him before."</p>
<p>"There are as many people named Johnson as there are rotten medlars."</p>
<p>"Ha! We're really lucky to have found this rubber man from India!"</p>

<h3>Wimbledon Tennis Tournament, Fourth Day: Cai Huiquan Eliminated, Losing to Gugkiewicz, Score Very Close; American Youth Smith Creates Another Miracle</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Wimbledon, 30th) On the fourth day of the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament, the men's singles entered the fourth round, and the women's doubles began. The situation was tense, and surprises occurred frequently.</p>
<p>Chinese players have all been eliminated. Xu Chengji retired, He Ai'ying was a flash in the pan, and although Cai Huiquan passed three rounds, he was unable to advance further. May they wait until next year, and wish Xu, Cai, and He the best of luck.</p>
<p>Cai Huiquan Defeated After Fierce Battle</p>
<p>In the first round, Cai Huiquan defeated Ireland's Aiken with scores of 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, and 6-3. In the second round, he defeated England's Jones with scores of 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, and 6-4 to advance to the third round, making him one of the Chinese players [on the list] [only a few]. However, yesterday when he played against Gugkiewicz, he was finally defeated with scores of 6-4, 7-5, and 6-4 and was eliminated.</p>
<p>Gugkiewicz is a player from South Korea's Tai Cup. Although he is not a seeded player in major tournaments, he eliminated the highly favored seeded player, American McNair, in the second round with a straight set. His strength is evident. In yesterday's match, Gugkiewicz's fierce serves often made Cai unable to parry, and his sharp smashes and volleys made Cai exhausted. Cai had saved a set point with great effort in the first set at 3-5, and had taken the lead in the second set with scores of 2-1, 3-2, and 5-3, but Gugkiewicz then won several games in a row. The final game of the third set was also a love game.</p>
<p>One Seeded Player Loses to Indian</p>
<p>Poland's top player, Trochinsky, the last "seeded player" in the tournament, actually lost to India's Homo Mohammed in a straight set yesterday, with scores of 6-0, 6-3, and 6-4.</p>
<p>Trochinsky's inclusion as a seeded player relied entirely on his performance in the Germany-Poland Tai Cup. He had never lost in this year's Tai Cup, even defeating German stars Henkel and Menzel. Therefore, the tournament gave him special attention and selected him as a seed. Unexpectedly, he was defeated by this Indian Tai Cup first singles player.) (Note: In the Queen's Club Championship, this Indian player was the "runner-up" - he lost to Clem in the final. Gugkiewicz was eliminated by him in the semi-finals, which shows that his strength is also not weak.)</p>
<p>Austin Wins Against Douroni</p>
<p>Riggs (USA) and Elverlow (New Zealand) fought fiercely, although Riggs won in a straight set, with scores of 8-6, 11-9, and 6-2.</p>
<p>Austin (England) and former Czech player Douroni also had a fierce struggle. Austin won the first two sets with scores of 7-5 and 9-7. Afterwards, Douroni was injured during the match the previous day and could not continue the competition, so he voluntarily announced his retirement.</p>
<p>Curry (USA) defeated Rogers (Ireland) without much effort, with scores of 7-5, 6-1, and 6-4.</p>
<p>Henkel (Germany) and Saffi (England) fought to four sets, with scores of 16-4, 4-6, 6-4, and 6-1.</p>
<p>Pansek (South Africa) defeated McPhael (England) 6-3, 6-3, and 7-5.</p>
<p>American Youth Breaks Through</p>
<p>American "unknown hero" Smith, who eliminated German star Menzel, continued to produce a second miracle. His opponent was former Czech star Gina. After a fierce five-set battle, Smith finally won with scores of 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 1-6, and 6-1 to enter the fourth round.</p>
<p>Smith is a young high school principal from California. He is not listed on the American Top Ten list. This is his "first time" participating in Wimbledon. Unexpectedly, he was able to make a splash and overcome two difficult obstacles.</p>
<p>French Veteran's Power Undiminished</p>
<p>French veteran Brunnone defeated Italian top player Steffani yesterday to enter the fourth round, with scores of 6-4, 6-8, and 6-4. Other results are as follows:</p>
<p>Butler (England) defeated Iverfer (Germany) - 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3,</p>
<p>Ziggity (Hungary) defeated Schwart (Netherlands) - 8-6, 6-4, 6-4,</p>
<p>Sheres (England) defeated Spa (Czech) - 7-5, 6-4, 9-7,</p>
<p>Russell (Argentina) defeated Mondran (England) - 10-8, 6-4, 6-1,</p>
<p>Drufford (England) defeated Mitik (South Africa) 7-5, 6-4, 2-6, 2-6, 6-3,</p>
<p>Olive (England) defeated Collins (England) - 8-6, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4,</p>
<p>One Seeded Team Loses in Women's Doubles</p>
<p>In the first round of the women's doubles, another unexpected result was created. One of the seeded teams, Mrs. Matthew (France) and Miss Judy Risgaski (Poland), was惨败 by Stammers (Netherlands) and Mrs. Haimosley, with a straight set score of 6-3, 6-1. This winning team is also not mediocre, as they were seniors who had won the championship twice before (they had won the championship in 1935 and 1936). They are making a comeback this time, and their style has not diminished.</p>
<p>Many English Women Transfer in Doubles</p>
<p>Mrs. Carter-Tala and Mrs. Little (England) defeated Mrs. Enterus (USA) and Mrs. Henloting (France) - 7-5, 6-2,</p>
<p>Miss Pay and Miss Cardinal (England) defeated Miss Titz and Miss Schuman (Germany) - 6-1, 6-1,</p>
<p>Mrs. Bourbon and Miss Chavez (England) defeated Miss Austin and Miss Candice (England) - 6-2, 6-2,</p>
<p>Miss Sormaki (Hungary) and Miss Wheeler (USA) defeated Miss Bruton and Miss McPherson (England) - 6-4, 7-5,</p>
<p>Miss Knoll and Miss Connell (England) defeated Miss Merio and Miss Sloan (England) - 6-4, 6-2,</p>

<p>Rambo and Miss Magellan (England) defeated Miss Santos and Miss Scott (England) - 6-2, 1-6, 6-4,</p>

<h3>Malayan Overseas Chinese Suspend National Games</h3>
<p>— Qian Li</p>
<p>While Hong Kong's Chinese teams are actively sending strong contingents to compete abroad, the Overseas Chinese in Ipoh, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, plan to donate the 20,000 yuan originally earmarked for the 5th All-Malaya Chinese Games in Ipoh to relieve the homeland and aid disaster relief. Simultaneously, they will temporarily halt construction on the Perak Grand Stadium. This is a matter that deserves our attention.</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese's love for sports is undoubtedly greater than that of our compatriots in the country. However, at this critical time for the nation, they are willing to forego their passion and allocate useful funds back to the homeland for disaster relief. Meanwhile, we are making every effort to use funds that should be used for resistance and disaster relief to attend the Olympics. Is this not a stark contrast?</p>
<p>Undeniably, sports have greatly benefited the youth of the new China, but we must ask, is sending a dozen or twenty athletes abroad enough to achieve the goal of revitalizing sports? Or are we using this to demonstrate our nation's wealth, unlike the pitiful people who cannot even afford to attend the World Games? Or are we using this to show the excellence of Chinese athletes and "promote national prestige" abroad? Unfortunately, the Chinese athletes sent to the World Games or the Davis Cup have always returned empty-handed, and even the strongest Chinese football teams have been repeatedly defeated by the South Vietnamese team, which is looked down upon by Europe. In this light, "promoting national prestige abroad" seems to be just a dream.</p>
<p>So, why? To show national wealth? But I think that even the so-called golden countries would not engage in such activities when their nation is in trouble. During the European War, which participating country attended international competitions? Even after the European War, did Germany and Russia not abstain from international competitions for many years? Does their doing so indicate their national poverty? No, absolutely not. On the contrary, it demonstrates their practicality and hard work, unlike our embellishment and muddled situation. Therefore, defeated Germany and chaotic Russia have today gained a pivotal position in the world, which is not accidental.</p>
<p>It has been almost two years since China began resisting the war, and in these two years, the loss of population, the destruction of property, and the fall of land have been rare tragedies in history. At this time of national crisis, with tens of thousands of people displaced, is it not a great joke to say that we still have the spare capacity to participate in such superficial and ostentatious national competitions? I don't believe that foreigners will praise China's wealth just because China attends the World Games. On the contrary, they may even laugh at our foolishness. Even the Japanese enemy's decision not to send a team is unlikely to be criticized for "national weakness." Because everyone knows that China and Japan are currently doing their best in the struggle for national survival.</p>
<p>Admittedly, sending a dozen or twenty athletes to the World Games may not require too much expense. Doing so may not necessarily weaken the country; not doing so may not necessarily save us from disaster. But the issue seems not to lie here, but in the spirit it represents. The cost of participating in the World Games may not be very high, but is the 20,000 yuan saved by the Ipoh Overseas Chinese a large sum? In any case, this money can save many wounded soldiers and many refugees.</p>
<p>Why can the Overseas Chinese in Ipoh think of this, while the compatriots in the country and Hong Kong, who are closer to the domestic tragedy, turn a blind eye? What is the reason for this? Is it neurological numbness? Or is the corruption too deep to extricate oneself? Or is this simply the demeanor of a great nation?</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, they actually have the leisure and elegance to send teams to tour and compete in the south, and to send athletes to attend the World Games. This suddenly makes me realize why, when American Overseas Chinese are struggling to prevent American workers from shipping scrap copper and iron to Japanese ships, our compatriots in Hong Kong are massively selling scrap copper and iron from the mainland and shipping it on X ships without hesitation. When Overseas Chinese everywhere are rising up, and even Europeans and Americans are boycotting Japanese goods, Japanese goods, such as fabrics and toys, fill the counters of Chinese stores in Hong Kong. Moreover, although Hong Kong is now a gathering place for wealthy Chinese officials, even the planned sale of 10 million yuan in national salvation bonds is still far from being fully subscribed.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, although the Chinese living in Hong Kong are also called "Overseas Chinese," they are ultimately too close to the homeland. The long-standing corrupt atmosphere of the mainland inevitably permeates the minds of the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, creating a sense of numbness and a life of drunken dreams. Look, the competition for beauty and extravagance in entertainment venues, the lively cheers in restaurants and tea houses, are they not in stark contrast to the flames of war and the broken limbs in the homeland?</p>
<p>The corrupt atmosphere in the homeland may have been purified by the continuous burning of Japanese bombs and gunpowder, removing the original hidden corruption. From the Soil</p>
<h3>Hunger and Struggle</h3>
<p>— Booker</p>
<p>Humanity is too threatened by hunger. Let's have a thorough and happy revolution to change this cruel world!</p>
<p>In these turbulent times, the hungry masses have gradually been bred and grown under the furnace of suffering! Producing an invincible force!</p>
<p>China is a country with a particularly large number of hungry refugees, which is giving China an unprecedented and powerful anti-imperialist force. This force is applied to the struggle to expel the invaders and eliminate traitors, and especially to the construction of a new democratic China. This is undoubtedly a great and invincible force!</p>
<p>"Hunger is power" (Guo Moruo) This power will become a pillar of international anti-aggression; a fortress of the world's anti-fascist struggle!</p>
<p>Our China, because the poor families account for the vast majority of the population, is also due to the invaders giving us many poor disasters, which have become the main factor for us to fight for national survival. At present, the hungry people have not only turned in hungry China and fallen into destruction, but have bravely participated in the struggle to resist Japan and save the country. Struggle is the only way out to win the liberation of the Chinese people. We must mobilize and arm this vast mass and work hard to resist the war.</p>
<p>There is no historical example of fleeing from the struggle because of hunger; there is no example of giving in and surrendering to the invaders because of hunger! On the contrary, hunger has set off an uncontrollable revolutionary mobilization!</p>
<p>China has suffered such a cruel disaster, and the vast people are in the sea of ​​hunger, which has increased their love for survival. In order to maintain the life of the motherland, they have given the invaders a strong resistance and set off a huge wave of national salvation. It doesn't matter if you are hungry, go and save the country!</p>
<p>To solve our own and everyone's hunger, we should rescue our entire nation from the great wave of national salvation!</p>
<p>Hunger is an urgent problem, but saving the national crisis is the first way to remedy hunger!</p>
<p>Resistance is the way to fight for the free life and construction of the Chinese people. The Chinese people must defeat aggression and obtain the rights to independent survival and freedom in the resistance war!</p>
<h3>I Devote Myself to the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>—Still a story about a girl—</p>
<p>Jingwen pointed out things of interest from home, her behavior sometimes younger than her age, but Qingzhi disdainfully went to sleep on her bed, ignoring her. She was always thinking in her heart that the quarantine officer would realize her mistake and agree to let them all go ashore immediately.</p>
<p>Her fantasy was never realized, and they were still on the ship until dark. Some people know how to pass the time. Some businessmen were gambling and drinking in the hall; and some businessmen who ran the docks had already dressed up, waiting to seize their first spoils of victory. They walked to the deck and looked at the calm sea, with a few fishermen's lights swaying slightly. But when they walked to the other side, they saw amazing scenery, all kinds of lights decorated the mountain city, and the sea left a brilliant projection, winding and winding, as if hanging straight to the bottom of the water. A boat passed by, disturbing the golden shadows, but soon they returned to their old appearance. The night just covered up the ugliness of this city, but it was decorated very beautifully by the lights of thousands of homes.</p>
<p>"Don't you like Daocheng?"</p>
<p>"I won't like it, because it's not ours."</p>
<p>She really didn't like this city, and she hated this city even more after only three days of staying here.</p>
<p>She always remembered those words. When they had just arrived on the shore, a friend who came to pick them up jokingly said to them:</p>
<p>"You have to be careful when walking here. If you are hit and killed by a car, you will only be compensated 50 yuan. If you spit on the road, you will also be fined 50 yuan. The price of a person is equal to a mouthful of sputum."</p>
<p>According to her observation, she even felt that a person was not as valuable as a mouthful of sputum. She once saw a hawker by the roadside, whose goods were kicked to the ground by a police officer. When the hawker went to grab them, he was also kicked to the ground. He was not a stone, so he wouldn't make the police officer's feet feel pain; he just fell uselessly to the ground, groaning, living Having seen the same scene; but she had never seen such a fierce police officer, nor had she seen such a person who did not dare to gasp for breath.</p>
<p>But here, since the fall of Shanghai, many people have come. In addition to most of the passers-by, a large group of wealthy idlers also came. Because of the speed and agility of the plane, people in high positions thousands of miles away can still come here to recuperate their bodies and minds. Here are people, and there are people there; but few people think of our suffering compatriots under the iron hooves of the invaders, and in the north and south, there are our warriors fighting the invaders with flesh and blood.</p>
<p>"They should enjoy it, because they have money."</p>
<p>Invisibly, it seems that a God here is proclaiming loudly that people who grow up here, or people who have passed middle age, are used to it, and their fire has been smoothed out by life; but she was originally full of power and wanted to destroy herself in order to make more people happy. It is really impossible to bear it here. She asked herself anxiously from time to time: "Could it be said that I am greedy for this comfort? Could it be said that I am not used to living under the rule of foreign races? Could it be said that I have also forgotten my brothers and sisters in suffering? 【To be continued】</p>
<h3>My Thoughts on Patriots</h3>
<p>— Sima Sheng</p>
<p>I read the original book of "Patriots" a long time ago, and I had many feelings to express; but at that time, many people were mobilizing to translate it, and there was a grand situation, and it seemed inconvenient to chime in. Recently, I saw several translations sold on the market, and I couldn't help but feel mixed emotions, so I had to express them.</p>
<p>My feeling about "Patriots" is that I was not "moved to indignation" like some people said. Pearl S. Buck's novels, to be fair, are nothing remarkable; especially her description of Chinese affairs is simply ridiculously superficial. Her description of Chinese peasant life in "The Good Earth," although it can "sell savage heads to Westerners," always reveals many flaws when read by our own people. However, because she is a Westerner, this recognition seems to be enough to make readers admire her (I don't know how many more superficial works there are in the Chinese literary world than hers!). And the reason why she was able to "cause a sensation in the American publishing world," "make a fortune," and even win the Nobel Prize is probably for this reason. With such a writer with insufficient understanding, to describe such a great scene, such a turbulent era, and such a complicated subject matter, it is certain that it will not be good. Therefore, the failure of "Patriots" is an expected thing, and it is originally "not worth mentioning." However, such an unremarkable work has not only "caused a sensation in the American publishing world" this time, but also "mobilized a large number of cultural people to translate and promote it." But it was a bit unexpected.</p>
<p>I think the shortcoming of "Patriots" is to avoid difficulties and take the easy way, avoid the important and take the light way, and avoid the complicated and take the simple way. Since the scene of this story includes the major changes in China in the past ten years, the emphasis should be on depicting the Chinese people reflected by those changes; since it has been expanded to the Anti-Japanese War and even after the retreat from Hankou, then it should be described The Chinese people's heroic resistance to the war that shocked the world. However, due to the author's lack of experience, she skipped those important factors. Therefore, we rummage through the original book and find that almost more than half of the space is used to describe a love story; and in the small half of the space, there is no effort to describe and render it, but try to avoid all actual scenes as much as possible. This is the biggest shortcoming I have discovered.</p>
<p>In addition, the author writes very vaguely about the characters in the book; this ambiguity is still due to her insufficient knowledge and experience. Wu Yifan and Liu Enlai should be two progressive models, but she wrote them into two legendary figures, not much to take. However, someone thought that there was an insult to China, and I think that was a bit excessive. Although the few paragraphs he excerpted were "voiced" "not out of context," I think they misunderstood the original meaning. "The author expresses the Tongzhou Incident in this way" is to describe the shameless propaganda in Japanese newspapers. "The author... chose this unfortunate thing and satirized it," and satirizing the Chinese Air Force and Army, is to describe Yike's traitorous consciousness and traitorous theory. This seems necessary in novels, because the characters in novels will not be heroes, and everyone is a good person. There will always be bad people and negative opinions.</p>
<p>I am not partial to the original author, but I think Pearl S. Buck may be quite sympathetic to China, but because her knowledge is not enough and her experience is not enough, she described it very vaguely, a bit of a trick. If you don't believe me, I can also excerpt a paragraph below!</p>

<h3>Indoor Flower Sales for 7/7 Memorial, 300,000 Flowers Already Pledged, Extended Deadline for Overseas Chinese Groups, Butchers to Suspend Slaughter for One Day on 7/7, Essay Contest on Resistance War by Student Aid Society Women's Group</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the general public's awareness and belief in our resistance war, and in commemoration of the second anniversary of the 7/7 Resistance War and National Construction, Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, in addition to observing a day of vegetarianism in accordance with the central government's order, will also hold various commemorative activities to expand the commemoration and raise huge sums of money to help the dead and compatriots who have suffered from the war. Indoor flower sales are the greatest collective fundraising event by the Overseas Chinese community. Flower sales began on October 26, and the original deadline was yesterday. However, the organizers believe that there are many Overseas Chinese groups and schools in Hong Kong, some of which may need to be discussed and then claimed. In order to ensure universality, the deadline has been extended. All Overseas Chinese groups and schools that wish to claim flowers can continue to apply to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. It is reported that from the 26th to the 30th, the number of flowers claimed by Overseas Chinese groups and schools has reached nearly 300,000, and the number of registered Overseas Chinese groups and schools has reached more than 590, but less than half have claimed flowers. It is expected that the number of 350,000 flowers may not be enough. As of yesterday, the number of payments received had reached more than 100,000, it is said.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Pui To Girls' Middle School held the 13th graduation ceremony for senior and junior high school and the 2nd graduation ceremony for primary school at the Kowloon branch of the YMCA yesterday (30th) at 1:30 PM. At around 1:00 PM, attendees took their seats. Principal Wen Yaobin announced the opening of the meeting. Professor Zhuang Zexuan of Lingnan University gave a speech, the main idea of which was that the greatest discovery in the world is the discovery of one's own abilities, intelligence, temperament, and strengths. If you graduates have a deep understanding of these four aspects, it will be beneficial to the country and to yourselves. Then, graduate Liang Qingzhu gave a speech, followed by the announcement of the names of the graduates by Huang Xiuqing, the director of studies, and Yang Liming, the director of the primary school.

<h3>Affiliated Middle School of Guangzhou University Holds Summer School</h3>
<p>The Affiliated Middle School of Guangzhou University on Yuanzhou Street, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, Hong Kong, is well-known for its excellent management. It is reported that the school will hold a summer school during the summer vacation to facilitate students' learning and tutoring, with classes for students preparing to enter universities, senior high schools, and junior high schools, as well as tutoring classes for each grade and elective classes. Classes are scheduled to start on the 5th of this month. The University Education Promotion Department will also open classes on the same day.</p>
<h3>School Overview</h3>
<p>Time flies like flowing water, and another day has passed. The students of each school, after the final exams, have begun their summer vacation. At this time, primary school students are promoted to middle school, and middle school students are seeking further education. Some students also want to transfer to a more convenient school. In order to facilitate the students in the above situations and provide them with a basis for choosing a school, this is the motivation for us to publish this summer school overview.</p>
<p>Pui Ying Middle School</p>
<p>Guangzhou Pui Ying Middle School was founded exactly 60 years ago. Initially, there was only one branch school in Hong Kong. Later, due to the fall of Guangzhou, the number of students gradually increased. Due to environmental needs, the school buildings for primary and secondary schools and kindergartens have now increased to more than five. The first is the senior high school administrative office (9 Conduit Road), the second is the senior high school second school building (75 Robinson Road), the third is the junior high school administrative office (Kau Yan Church, High Street), the fourth is the junior high school second school building (6 Tiegang), the fifth is the primary school administrative office (84 Bonham Road). There are more than 400 senior high school students and more than 300 boarding students. Each teacher in the school is only responsible for teaching one subject, which is considered to be their special responsibility.</p>
<p>The school has close ties with domestic universities, and many senior high school graduates with excellent academic records have gone on to study at domestic universities over the years. There are more than 120 graduates in the current senior high school class, breaking the record for the number of senior high school graduates in Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>The school is now recruiting new and transfer students for the autumn semester in each grade of senior and junior high school, spring semester transfer students for the first and second grades of junior high school, and spring and autumn semester visiting students for each grade.</p>
<p>Registration procedure: Students who wish to apply can first go to the senior high school (9 Conduit Road) or the junior high school (Kau Yan Church, High Street) and (6 Tiegang) to obtain a registration form. After filling it out, submit it along with two 2.5-inch bust photos and a registration fee of one yuan to the registration office to retrieve the admission ticket for the examination on schedule.</p>
<p>The subjects for the examination are Chinese, English, Arithmetic, and General Knowledge (General Knowledge includes Civics, History, Geography, and Nature, etc.).</p>
<p>Tuition fees: The annual fee for junior high school boarding students is 159 yuan, and the fee for non-boarding students is 78 yuan. The annual fee for senior high school boarding students is 169 yuan, and the fee for non-boarding students is 88 yuan.</p>
<p>Because the school is run by a church, it pays special attention to moral education.</p>
<h3>Chinese Amateur Alumni Association Promotes Summer Life and Holds Literary Evening on July 1st</h3>
<p>The Chinese Amateur School Alumni Association, in order to practice "collective sovereignty, self-education" and use the summer to connect with alumni, has organized a summer collective life committee to promote summer activities. The activities will last for one month, from July 1st to 31st, and the schedule is as follows: (1) Literary and music evening; (2) "Double Seventh" Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Second Anniversary Commemorative Ceremony; (3) Summer camp and summer meeting; (4) River cruise; (5) Evening meeting and group meeting (with celebrities giving speeches every week); (6) Weekly publication of "Special Issue."</p>

<h3>Motorcycle Rider Not Inoculated, Macau Jockey Club Reschedules Racing. Jockey Club's Request for Accommodation Denied, Must Wait for Hong Kong and Macau Consultation Before Scheduling Can Be Determined</h3>
<p>The Macau Jockey Club's July horse racing was originally scheduled to be held tomorrow. However, the health authorities of Hong Kong and Macau are cooperating closely to implement emergency epidemic prevention regulations. Passengers traveling between the two places must be inoculated against cholera six days in advance and obtain a certificate from the Port Health Department of Hong Kong before boarding the ship. The Jockey Club, considering that some of the riders had not been inoculated in advance, was deeply concerned that they would be detained and therefore intended to ask the health authorities of Hong Kong and Macau for accommodation, whereby the Jockey Club would issue its own certificates or certificates issued by the field doctor inoculation clinic, which the Jockey Club would then certify. The person in charge of the Jockey Club held this request to the Macanese health authorities, who agreed to accept it, but the Hong Kong Port Health Department did not want to change the regulations. The person in charge of the Jockey Club, being unsuccessful, believed that it would not only be inconvenient for visitors to Macau, but also difficult for some riders, and therefore decided to postpone the July horse racing until the Macanese authorities had fully consulted with the Hong Kong authorities before notifying all sectors of the rescheduled date. It is reported that there were originally six races scheduled for the start of the race on July 2nd, including a one-dollar big raffle case to commemorate Mr. Potts of the Jockey Club. This raffle had a large number of tickets sold in Hong Kong and Macau. Now that it has been rescheduled, the sold raffle tickets and cover tickets will be fully valid when the race is held.</p>

<h3>Pui To Girls' Middle School Graduation Ceremony Celebrated</h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>"Lingering in Pui To for another three autumns, memories linger, green fills the window, the taste of books is forever, the sound of Qin zhao is separated by flowers, gathering red lychees on the branches, no one buys a boat to return, the corners of the earth and the horizon are expected to meet again, the weeping willows in the post pavilion add to the sorrow." This is a graduation song, this is a graduation song sung at the 13th graduation ceremony of senior and junior high school and the 2nd graduation ceremony of primary school at the Guangzhou Private Pui To Girls' Middle School. After all, most people are emotional, and who is ruthless? After many years of studying together, once we part, everyone's heart will naturally have a sour taste. However, in the midst of the sad farewell, these many graduates can solemnly express the lofty responsibilities given to them by the motherland. If they can do this, it will not be in vain for the school's cultivation, nor will it be in vain to be a good daughter of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The twelve graduates of the senior high school spring class and the twenty-six graduates of the senior high school autumn class were all wearing silk ribbons and sitting on the stage with vigor. The remaining thirteen graduates of the junior high school spring class and the forty-three graduates of the junior high school autumn class, as well as thirty-odd primary school graduates, and some guests and students, completely filled the auditorium of the Kowloon branch of the YMCA. The latecomers mostly sighed at the small space, and it was extremely lively.</p>
<p>Ambassador Zhuang Zexuan gave a speech on "The Discovery of Man," from hard work to intellectual training and personal cultivation, introducing his personal practical life experience from his student days to the present to this group of graduates who are about to leave school and move on to another new stage. This is very precious.</p>
<p>Finally, Principal Wen Yaobin gave a speech, raising two questions to the graduating students: a review of the past and a vision for the future, hoping that all graduates will be down-to-earth and move forward bravely, becoming the darlings of the times and not being left behind by the times.</p>
<h3>"China Relief" Offers Precious Contribution Before Departure: "By the Yongding River" Performance Tonight Depicts a Tense, Exciting, Wonderful, and Great Story of July</h3>
<p>Before "China Relief" goes abroad, it is scheduled to perform "By the Yongding River," "Earth Tribulation," and "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom" at the Lee Theatre for three days from today to the day after tomorrow. This performance is a charity fundraiser for the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, so it is of particularly great significance. After this performance, "China Relief" will go to the Philippines and then to the United States.</p>
<p>Drama in Hong Kong has no status, and drama comrades are very fragile because of various inconvenient conditions. But since "China Travel," "China Arts," and "China Relief," which are mentioned in this article, came to Hong Kong, the drama movement in Hong Kong has begun to play an active role. In particular, "China Relief," with its perfect and refined performances, has given Hong Kong overseas Chinese a new understanding and new interest. Some time ago, "China Relief" successively performed "Spring in Taierzhuang," "Long Live the Nation," and "Defend the Motherland." Tickets were sold at the lowest prices of one dime, two dimes, and four dimes, accommodating many overseas Chinese and giving them an opportunity for a new perspective. It would probably be impossible for a theater troupe that specializes in making money to offer this lowest ticket price, but "China Relief" did it. From this, we can know the spirit of hardship of the comrades of "China Relief." This alone is enough for everyone to admire.</p>
<p>As for this performance, it has such an origin, and I will explain it here. "China Relief" was originally scheduled to go abroad at the end of June, but due to the ship schedule, it was postponed to July. It will probably be able to go abroad nationally within seven days. After the last performance, various community schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon requested a repeat performance one after another, but they declined because they were too busy preparing to go abroad. However, when the Women's War Disaster Relief Association arrived in Hong Kong, they first welcomed and invited cooperation to raise funds for the refugees, so "China Relief" finally fulfilled its promise before going abroad, and thus there was this huge task of three consecutive days of performances.</p>
<p>This performance will be more exciting than before. One is the expansion of the scenery, the second is the proper preparation, and the third is that the selected scripts are all the best works of "China Relief." As for mobilizing all the members of the troupe, that is inevitable.</p>
<p>I would like to say to the overseas Chinese, if you want to feast your eyes and clear your mind, please take the time to go and see it. This is not only about watching a play, but also about knowing that our War of Resistance will be victorious and our national construction will be successful. "China Relief" uses drama to illustrate the brilliance of the new China, which is what the overseas Chinese are most happy to understand. Therefore, overseas Chinese should not regard "China Relief" as an ordinary theater troupe, but should have a deeper understanding of them. Moreover, this performance is to raise funds for disaster relief. Buying one more ticket means saving one more life. It is really good to donate to entertainment.</p>

<h3>Valuable Contribution of "China Relief" Before Farewell: "By the Yongding River" Performance Tonight Depicts a Tense, Exciting, Wonderful, and Great Story of July</h3>
<h3>Farewell Address for the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe's Charity Performance</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe's overseas tour for publicity, passing through Hong Kong, has left an extremely deep impression and a naturally good feeling among people from all walks of life in Hong Kong. I remember the last time they gave a charity performance at the Lee Theatre, although it was raining continuously and there were no temptations of "powder and rouge," they were able to break the Hong Kong box office record. Furthermore, many audience members, with enthusiastic hearts, were left outside the theater, disappointed due to "full seating." This is the glorious record that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe has left in Hong Kong, and it can also be said to be a "guidepost" for all theater movement workers in Hong Kong! Now that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe is about to embark on their overseas publicity tour, they are holding a final charity performance before their departure. The content of this charity performance includes "By the Yongding River," a play written by the National Playwrights Association depicting the Lugou Bridge Incident; "Cataclysm of the Land," a play written by Tian Han, Zhang Min, Hong Shen, Zhang Ke, and others, recreating the reality of China during the war of resistance; and "Blood Splatters on Peach Blossoms," a collective creation by the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe depicting the historical traces of the war of resistance in southern Shandong. This charity performance aims to raise funds for the Hong Kong Women's War Relief Association to aid wounded soldiers and refugees. I believe that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe will be able to maintain and promote the glorious record they created last time, and I further believe that they will strengthen the determination of Hong Kong theater movement workers to "make drama serve the war of resistance and nation-building!"</p>
<p>The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe was born and grew up under the × people's gunfire. The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe has also traveled tirelessly to various frontlines and the vast rear. After this "final charity performance," they will go to the Philippines and then to the United States. I hope and believe that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe abroad will, based on what they have seen and known, use art to raise the national self-esteem and self-confidence of our vast overseas Chinese compatriots in the manner of a "petrel," and call on every overseas Chinese who does not want to be a slave to contribute their vivid or material strength for the independence of the motherland, the liberation of the nation, their own happiness, and the final victory of the war of resistance and nation-building. This is the first point. Secondly, the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe's organizational life and attitude are known for being "serious, tense, united, and lively," which can also be said to possess the basic conditions for a public salvation publicity effort. This time, going abroad, they should further play a model role among overseas Chinese, especially in overseas Chinese salvation organizations, drama and general cultural organizations. It is not only about mobilizing, but also about organizing overseas Chinese. The war of resistance and nation-building are entering a new, even final, critical juncture. Overcoming the difficulties and dangers of this juncture mainly relies on the organization of the vast public. The overseas Chinese, who bear the honor of being the "mother of the revolution," are of almost decisive significance in this regard. This is the second point. In addition, in coordination with ××'s new strategy of destroying China with "military as auxiliary and politics as the main," ××××, as well as elements who are oblivious to conscience, stubborn, and selfish, are colluding in a despicable manner, using the slogans of peace and anti-communism to undermine the unity of the entire nation, to undermine the active, comprehensive, and protracted war of resistance, in an attempt to divide and then conquer China. Their evil hands are also spreading in various parts of the country, and naturally, they are even more frantically waving among overseas Chinese. We must raise the vigilance of overseas Chinese regarding ××'s activities, guard against and consolidate and expand the united front, and give them a merciless blow.</p>
<p>It is precisely on the eve of the second anniversary of the Chinese people's heroic war of resistance that we are seeing the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe perform "By the Yongding River," a story depicting the Lugou Bridge Incident! The battle by the Yongding River was the first protest by the Chinese nation against the long-term ×× fate, the first time the Chinese nation recognized that "sacrifice had reached the final juncture," and that "'compromise midway would be equivalent to complete surrender," and it was also the first time the Chinese nation united to launch a full-scale war of resistance to safeguard the integrity of territorial sovereignty. Two years later, we are gradually moving away from danger, and the sun is sinking deeper and deeper, while Wang Jingwei and the overt and covert traitors who echoed Wang Jingwei's traitorous rhetoric are attempting to establish a "anti-communist" court by concluding treaties of national betrayal on the bodies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers who have heroically sacrificed and millions of refugees who have been displaced! After seeing this performance by the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe, we will surely increase our ×××××××××× and strengthen our determination and confidence in supporting the central government and supporting Chairman Chiang to complete the war of resistance and nation-building. ×××××××××× is the day when true peace and final victory will appear! I hope that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe and Hong Kong theater movement workers will work together to strive for the early arrival of this day!</p>
<h3>The Vanguard of War of Resistance Drama</h3>
<p>— Huang Dacai</p>
<p>The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe is about to go abroad.</p>
<p>This sentence has become a topic of conversation or writing material for theater workers and cultural circles at present.</p>
<p>Before going abroad, and while the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe is performing to raise funds for the Women's War Relief Association, I would like to take advantage of this valuable space to say a few words.</p>
<p>The members of the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe are theater workers, so of course, they cannot help but talk about their profession. However, it would be more accurate to call it a war of resistance drama movement. Drama has its universality and knows no borders. American song and dance films, sexually suggestive films, fascist invasion films, and anesthetic films cannot deny that they are not drama. However, the object is different, and the effect has dangerous tendencies. For example, if we currently take sexually suggestive films, song and dance films, invasion films, and anesthetic films as our drama and release and spread them, then the impact would be unimaginable. Because the audience is anesthetized, they lose their vigilance, do not know how to invigorate themselves, and do not know how to contribute to the country. If this continues to develop, the result will be the danger of national subjugation and racial extinction!</p>
<p>Understanding this point, we can know the urgent need and necessity of war of resistance drama. The significance of war of resistance drama is to concretely use various different techniques to weave the great and arduous project of war of resistance and nation-building, the magnificent and heroic deeds of war of resistance and nation-building, through the scope of drama, into an effect of edification. To arouse emotional resonance and promote unity of purpose. Its ultimate goal is to devote all efforts to supporting the war of resistance and nation-building, and to devote all efforts to resisting the only current enemy — the Japanese militarists.</p>
<p>What I have said above is only the minimum principle of war of resistance drama. Drama that violates this principle does not deserve to be called war of resistance drama. In the most arduous and most serious war of resistance and nation-building drama, there is only "national policy first" and "war of resistance first." Therefore, for drama that violates the war of resistance and nation-building, we can put forward the task of criticism, but at the same time, we should take out our own "goods."</p>
<p>The "goods" of "China Salvation" are genuine and courageous war of resistance drama. In the past, present, and future, they will always maintain one principle and one belief, which is "nation above all" and "victory above all"!</p>
<p>In the meantime, "China Salvation" is prepared to do its best, no matter where it goes. It can be guaranteed here, and it is firmly believed, that "China Salvation" will never, in a moment of joy, perform a song and dance or sexually suggestive drama of the same kind as American song and dance films and sexually suggestive films; nor will it be as brutal and ferocious as fascist invasion films and anesthetic films that violate the times. The war of resistance drama of "China Salvation" is righteous and embodies the supreme truth of survival. Every nation in the world that wants to survive, every nation that resists aggression, should have the necessity to see the war of resistance drama of "China Salvation," and should have the necessity to participate in the war of resistance drama of "China Salvation."</p>
<p>Today, the fascist evil hands are preparing and have already used bloody hands to seize the nations that want to survive. In the West, there are Germany, Italy, and Franco, and in the East, there is ××××'s Japan. In some countries, they are afraid of the power of fascism and seek compromise, while we are bravely giving blows to those who give blows. We have resisted the Japanese militarists for as long as two years, smashing the × people's poisonous plan of quick battles and quick resolution, quick battles and quick peace.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Chinese nation is the outstanding nation of the world, and the Chinese nation has already fought a fierce vanguard battle for the democratic countries for two years.</p>
<p>"China Salvation" has been tempered and grown up in these two years of blood and flesh. "China Salvation" has already taken its own genuine, courageous, and valuable "goods" all over the north and south war zones, edifying thousands of soldiers and civilians. Now, going abroad, in a word, is to directly tell overseas Chinese the belief that the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built, and at the same time, bring the enthusiasm and strength of overseas Chinese back to the motherland to jointly strive for victory.</p>
<p>The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe is about to go abroad.</p>
<p>This sentence has become a topic of conversation or writing material for theater workers and cultural circles at present.</p>
<p>But I must appeal on behalf of them: In Hong Kong, in domestic cultural people, theater workers, and people from all walks of life, please give "China Salvation" enthusiastic support.</p>
<p>Jin Shan said: "If we are sentries, then we hope that the cultural circles at home and abroad, and all compatriots in the country, will be our backing, teaching and guiding us!".</p>

<h3>Launch the Overseas Chinese Drama Movement!</h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese scattered all over the world are a strong pillar of the war of resistance. In the overthrow of the Manchu Qing dynasty and the national revolution to overthrow the feudal warlords, they have done their utmost. After the July 7th Incident, they showed even greater strength. This is inevitable. Without extensive mobilization of the manpower and material resources of overseas Chinese, our national general mobilization cannot be considered complete. Without the overseas Chinese returning to serve the country and actively transporting supplies, the victory of the national liberation war will certainly not be as fast as we expected.</p>
<p>However, the cultural level of overseas Chinese is too low, and they lack spiritual sustenance. They are too far away from the struggle of the motherland, and their daily spirit also lacks nourishment. At this time, the most powerful medium that can popularly and vividly report the news of the motherland's struggle to them, portray the faces of 400 million people seeking liberation, solve their intellectual hunger, and organize their service emotions is art, it is the drama art that is truly alive and pulsing, it is the war of resistance drama art that has been forged in the flames of war.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Since the start of the war of resistance, the Wuhan Chorus has been able to not only self-sufficient in Southeast Asia, but also remitted a large amount of funds to the central government. The efforts of Lingren Xindu in the United States and Southeast Asia have added many ambulances to our front lines. Recently, even the smallest places in Southeast Asia have drama troupes, and many famous domestic dramas have been staged.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and other places not only have more enthusiasm for saving the country, but also have improved their need for and ability to appreciate art.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Now is the best opportunity to launch the overseas Chinese drama movement. Should</p>
<p>(1) Report on the struggle of the motherland for liberation and construction of a new China;</p>
<p>(2) Portray the glorious deeds of overseas Chinese in the history of the Chinese revolution;</p>
<p>(3) Introduce domestic war of resistance scripts so that everyone can come into contact with new content, and from this content, increase their understanding and closeness to the motherland;</p>
<p>(4) Demonstrate and guide so that war of resistance drama movement has positions everywhere, with small stations, medium stations, and even general stations;</p>

<h3>Ode to "China Salvation"</h3>
<p>— Cicada's Cry</p>
<p>I sing of "China Salvation" with enthusiasm full of emotion, just like singing of heroic and glorious soldiers fighting for the land of the motherland!</p>
<p>A group of heroic drama warriors, struggled for nearly a dozen months, experienced many hardships, traveled all over the north and south battlefields, thousands of miles of war-torn journey, stepped across the boundless mountains and fields, and finally, with glorious practical experience, went to distant overseas to declare the war of resistance of the motherland. This indomitable spirit and courage is not a sketch in words, nor is it false talk, but a living reality, a genuine work that has been tempered thousands of times! !</p>
<p>How worthy is this excellent and great worker who serves the motherland's war of resistance of being praised by every Chinese son and daughter!</p>
<p>The Hong Kong drama movement has never blossomed with such brilliant sparks, just like the light that has shone on our theater scene in the past two months; but "China Salvation" has given us the source of the fire that burns brightly. In these two months, how has the drama climax in Hong Kong surged to its peak, and how have all the people, the people who love the motherland, been swept up in the drama frenzy!</p>
<p>China Salvation has written a page of immortal history for the Hong Kong theater scene. They have performed four times, shattering the dreams of those who have always despised drama, and putting the real deeds of benefiting the front-line battles of the motherland on stage with the skills of drama art, strengthening the people living under red lights and green wine's knowledge of the × people. This kind of realistic art that actively contains national defense and war of resistance consciousness has made great contributions to the national liberation struggle!</p>
<p>This performance is the last finale in Hong Kong, and it is also a roaring reproduction. Soon, the sea waves will take them overseas, taking the experience of real life and the spirit of work, informing the overseas Chinese compatriots that the motherland will not succumb, and our nation will live forever on our land!</p>
<p>Their past and future are all fighting under the banner of the motherland's war. May the spirit of "China Salvation" exist forever with the eternal life of the motherland.</p>
<h3>"China Salvation"'s Gift</h3>
<p>— Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>I often have a kind of silent expectation that is not easily understood by others, especially recently, confined to the sickbed by a minor illness, the mood of regret filled my heart.</p>
<p>I knew the news of "China Salvation"'s final performance in Hong Kong long ago. Of course, it was an exciting thing, but at the same time, I deeply felt infinite confusion!</p>
<p>——The tail of the final performance will lead them away from Hong Kong and to overseas!</p>
<p>In terms of personal friendship and work learning, the departure of "China Salvation" from Hong Kong seems to be a regrettable loss. Although they will probably return to their homeland soon, in any case, the distance makes friendship and learning temporarily separated and alienated.</p>
<p>This separation and alienation will make a person who deeply and quietly cherishes rich friendship feel confused and embarrassed.</p>
<p>However, who can easily stop this group of travelers who are ready to go? For the sake of declaring the great national self-defense war of resistance of the motherland, they are heroically shouldering a not insignificant burden to the overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>May they have a pleasant sea journey after the end of this performance!</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I wake up in the middle of the night, I silently think of many things; what makes myself even more immersed is looking out at the motherland with flames of war everywhere. On that vast land, the × people cruelly trampled on our ancestral graves and workshops, but encountered great unexpected resistance and counterattacks! Oppression and slaughter have made the weak and timid strong, and the young generation is growing up more heroically in constant struggle.</p>
<p>"China Salvation" developed and grew up in this way in the arduous national liberation struggle. For twenty months, they carried props, costumes, and stage equipment, galloped across the north and south battlefields, came and went in bombings, struggled in hardship, and exerted the most excellent force of wartime drama art. In continuous work and continuous training, they became a strong force of drama workers in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Carrying the hardships of their journey, leaving the land of the motherland, shouldering the great mission of publicity and fundraising overseas, the sea vessel took them to Hong Kong, the first stop of this international publicity, and temporarily stayed in this colony.</p>
<p>The wartime drama movement in Hong Kong took a new turn after the Customs Long March Troupe came to Hong Kong in May 1938 and performed "Frontier Storm," and the Zhonglv came to Hong Kong in mid-September for continuous performances. However, without more abundant inducements, stepping into 1939, we began to have new life. The arrival of "China Salvation" has advanced the entire Hong Kong theater scene to a high tide, no doubt, China Salvation is powerfully ignited Hong Kong's theater Beacon!</p>
<p>During this period, the entire Hong Kong was swept into a dramatic situation. This power is definitely not something that other teams can easily do, nor is it something that other teams can achieve by pretentiousness or exaggeration.</p>
<p>The achievement that "China Salvation" gave to the Hong Kong theater scene is to completely and clearly point out the practical gains of the excellent workers tempered from the great war of resistance in the motherland! !</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>The theater scene in Hong Kong has always been regarded as abnormal by people and has never been valued by the idle. They feel that this is a childish game or a boring tool for war of resistance slogans. This kind of "drama" that is not valued is naturally not worth spending time on, and it is even more impossible to spend money on it!</p>
<p>"China Salvation" heroically rescued them, rescued this group of people wearing yellow-tinted glasses, sincerely guided them to appreciate a true entertainment belonging to art, and even told them in a sophisticated and magnificent performance: the motherland is struggling to turn over and seek national freedom and independence in such hardship, how cruelly our ×× is looting on our ancestral graves and fields… making them startled, and making them weep, but even more angry and fanatical!</p>
<p>At this point, China Salvation has eliminated the deep-rooted negative psychology of those who despise and despise drama.</p>
<p>Similarly, people engaged in drama work in Hong Kong feel depressed, feel that there is no way out, and feel that the future is bleak. In particular, they seem to think that war of resistance drama cannot make money in Hong Kong and cannot be staged professionally. Therefore, they cleverly avoid reality and hope to stage drama for the sake of art.</p>
<p>However, China Salvation answered them sternly, war of resistance drama is not that it cannot make money, it is not that it cannot be staged by professional groups. The problem is that excellent art has not been put into the atmosphere of war of resistance drama. War of resistance works that have passed through the artistic form will never be without soul and will never be without audience love. We cannot completely say that the performance of "China Salvation" is 100% superior, but in the enthusiastic desire of the audience, we can estimate how their performance is expressed.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>How moved we are by this warrior who grew up on the land of the motherland - it seems that we no longer need to use beautiful words or odes to participate in the body of China Salvation. A noble hero will hide under the shade of a big tree and silently recall his own battle exploits…</p>
<p>Really, China Salvation needs more frank and sincere opinions.</p>
<p>I am surprised, why is it that their great performances in Hong Kong have never seen more precise and correct criticisms? At least, the friends of China Salvation must also feel that there are many things that they have not done well. People who admire them are so admiring them, but why don't they more sincerely and accurately tell them some good things they already know or don't know?</p>
<p>By doing so, I believe it will make "China Salvation" grow even more progressively.</p>
<p>China Salvation has taught us many things, often in many situations. I am too moved, they are so serious and hardworking about their work, and so enthusiastic and sincere about friendship. Many memories that are not easy to forget will be forever remembered in my own memories.</p>
<p>May these many touching memories make me often remember this heroic warrior!</p>
<p>1939, June, 30, in illness.</p>
<h3>Postscript</h3>
<p>The China Salvation Drama Troupe will start its large-scale farewell 746th charity performance at the Lee Theatre again today. In order to give a more detailed report on their performance and to make a more objective assessment of their work in Hong Kong for the past three months, this issue of our magazine will meet with our readers one day in advance.</p>
<p>Regarding China Salvation, we have repeatedly spared no expense in our space. From the editor's point of view, on the one hand, we are standing on the position of the salvation drama movement, hoping that the Hong Kong drama movement will become more prosperous because of the stimulation of their arrival; and on the other hand, we are impressed by the "China Salvation" troupe's serious and thorough work spirit of sacrificing everything for national liberation, the indomitable, courageous, hardworking, and strong perseverance, the simple and sincere high enthusiasm, the strict, solid, and democratic organization, the strict work discipline, the diligent and tireless spirit of learning, and the arduous and enduring struggle life… all of these are worthy of our learning and promotion.</p>
<p>For any individual or any group, we have one wish: to make fair criticisms, to absorb their strengths, and to discard their weaknesses. We will unconditionally do our best to promote good and bright things. We will also examine the bad things without hesitation; but blind support and unreasonable abuse are not taken by true workers. As for the achievements, work spirit, and work attitude of the "China Salvation" comrades in the war zone for twenty months and in Hong Kong for three months, I think there is no need for me to say more.</p>
<p>Now that "China Salvation" is about to leave Hong Kong, Mr. Jiang Ming proposed at the farewell dinner for "China Salvation" held by the Yelian Society that this publication be the place for future communication and contact between "China Salvation" and Hong Kong drama workers. On this point, the editor is very happy to do his best to hope that China Salvation will often contact us after leaving Hong Kong, and that Hong Kong drama workers will also hope to more enthusiastically use this space of this publication! (Editor)</p>
<h3>The July Ablaze with War</h3>
<p>— Wu He</p>
<p>Regarding the Banks of the Yongding River</p>
<p>It is July again, a most memorable and worthy time to celebrate. The Chinese nation, having endured seven years of humiliation, stands tall and strong on this land, ready to vent seven years of pent-up anger and rise to be its own master!</p>
<p>In July two years ago, the first shot at Lugou Bridge made every Chinese person who refused to be a slave stand up straight, tears of joy streaming down their faces. We all jumped up excitedly, saying everything we had not said for seven years with great satisfaction, and with a mighty voice, doing everything we had not done for seven years—no, for forty years. The Chinese nation began to break free from its shackles, fighting for our nation's freedom with blood and flesh!</p>
<p>Oh, the laudable July!</p>
<p>The descendants of the Chinese nation should be doubly inspired and work doubly hard in July! So that the heroes of Lugou Bridge can smile in their graves, and the incomparably brutal ×× can collapse more quickly!</p>
<p>In July two years ago, the National Playwrights Association called on all Shanghai playwrights to perform "The Banks of the Yongding River" in Shanghai, hoping to sow the seeds of the Lugou Bridge struggle in Shanghai, where we have lived for many years, and to ignite the torch of national liberation struggle already raised on the banks of the Yongding River in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Today, in Hong Kong, to commemorate July, we are making "The Banks of the Yongding River" the first program of this charity performance. We are immersed in deep memories: the tense atmosphere throughout the country at that time, the enthusiastic emotions, the determination to fight, and the heroic actions, all feel as vivid as if they were happening now. These intimate feelings and circumstances are precious. Today, we want to use this play to convey to the audience, so that the audience can take a historical mirror to look back at the early days of the war of resistance, and be alerted and encouraged.</p>
<p>This time, "The Banks of the Yongding River" has an "Overture" added to the beginning. This "Overture" was originally a one-act play, but it is difficult to evoke deeper emotions in the audience when performed alone. Now added to the front of "The Banks of the Yongding River," it may make the play slightly more complete, while this one-act play has gained new life because of it.</p>
<p>A friend said very well about this "Overture": "It's like a history textbook." This lesson outlines the situation from September 18th to Lugou Bridge: Dongshan Province was forcibly occupied, Rehe was plundered, the father's tolerance, the son's anger, and the duel at Lugou Bridge (original: Pingjin) are all symbolically written out. This is truly a lesson in history, and it is a history that we should read! Especially today, on the second anniversary of the War of Resistance, we must be familiar with the course of × people's aggression against China since September 18th. Remembering the past is precisely to encourage the future.</p>
<p>It is said that this play is being performed for the first time in Hong Kong. Place it in front of the "Overture" and let it meet the audience in Hong Kong for the first time. In the July ablaze with war, the audience can glimpse from this play the surging anti-Japanese actions like waves two years ago, and the anti-Japanese will as strong as steel, and feel that the "Overture" is helping the integrity of the whole play, then "Since September 18th" still has fresh life today!</p>
