<p>社評</p>
<h3>羅總統和平計劃的重大意義</h3>
<p>屢次斥責世界侵畧者並倡言共同加以制裁的美國羅斯福總統，十五日又以極勇敢極坦誠的態度，致電希特勒及慕索里尼，提議和平計劃。其內容約有三個要點：其一，揭露侵略者屢次倡言和平而事實則一再吞併別人的國家。其二，闡明美國之態度與用意在於悲憫世界人類，而非力量薄弱胆怯畏戰；其三，具體提議共同保證世界三十一個國家安全。在德意日之侵略國家正加强其鯨吞蠶蝕政策的今日，羅總統這個和平計劃，是具有極重大意義的。</p>
<p>英法近日因為德意蠢動之猛進，對於反侵略集團之召集，也漸趨於積極。就一般情勢看來，世界反侵略集團之形成，已漸具體化。不但東歐諸小國已漸趨英法的領導之下，英法蘇的軍事合作也已有美滿的傾向，英極欲蘇聯參加「反希特勒集團準備與蘇聯成立空車協定，法國也在與蘇聯商締新協定，俾蘇聯自動援助。這時候，美國的態度與政策，對於這個反侵略集團之組織具有極大的作用，事勢所趨，有使歐洲反希特勒運動，具體變成世界反侵略陣綫的可能。</p>
<p>我們何以要這樣說呢？羅總統的提議不是整個世界和平的計劃嗎？羅總統的和平計劃絕對不能得到希特勒，莫索里尼，乃至東方侵畧者日本的贊同的，自羅總統和平計劃發出後，希特勒及莫索里尼等雖尙在仔細研究之中，但是德意報紙殆已一致地加以惡意的批評，柏林十七日電甚至稱：「希特勒自與里賓特　甫及莫索里尼商議後，卽决定對羅總統的建議加以拒絕。德國方面，更加擴大所謂「倫敦反對德人的恐怖」的宣傳。</p>
<p>羅總統和平計劃可能的效果，是更加具體而急速地促成和平國家締結成功反侵略的集團。和平計劃最大的反響是反侵略最積極的國家的響應。蘇聯各報一致地熱烈歡迎和平計劃，政界方面認羅總統的提議為維持世界和平的一種實際有效的步驟，蘇聯人民委員會主席加列寧甚至對羅總統專電馳賀。其次，英法等反侵略國家的輿論界及政界，也皆以極興奮的態度和口吻歡迎羅總統的提議。</p>
<p>羅總統的這一和平計劃，對于包括東方侵畧者，為反對的對象，使反侵略集團成為全世界的，而不只限於歐洲。和平建議中曾經提到日本侵畧者侵佔了中是一種遺漏，我們希望在太平洋和平維持上舉足輕重的美國，能得再有機會重申此點。同時，示來世界反侵略集團的締結，務必把東方包括在內，使得成為二個完整的「集團安全制」。現在，侵略國家的行動巳很顯明地密切聯成一片了，並且是東西相呼應的。不管東方侵略者自己的內部還有人不贊成率然加入德意日三國軍事同盟，但是三個侵畧國家的帮兇共謀，已是不可否認的事實了。</p>
<p>中國最近已在南北各　塲大舉反攻，並且節節勝利，這於包括東方的世界反侵略陣線之具體形成，當具有極重大的意義。一切世界反侵略計劃之提出，不應忘記中國是當中的一個支柱。</p>
<h3>戰時中國之經濟外交</h3>
<p>— 張肖梅</p>
<p>張肖梅博士，係中外聞各之經濟學家，歷任中國銀行經濟研究室主任，並主辦中國國民經濟研究所，最近籌備成立之國立西南經濟研究所副主任一席，聞亦已聘定張博士担任。</p>
<p>（一）現代戰爭之成敗關鍵</p>
<p>一九一四年世界大戰，德國獨擋一面，轉戰四年，終於敗績：非前綫之不利，乃後方之不濟。名將魯屯道夫，本大戰經騐，倡全民戰爭論；以為現代戰爭，無前後方之分；勝負所决，不在軍備之多寡，而在全國資源之厚薄。蓋已不　於雙方軍隊之交鋒，而為兩大民族之鬥爭矣。</p>
<p>古云「勝負乃兵家常事」今日尤信；夫以一時之得失，殊不足為决勝之關鍵，戰爭之持久，至於最後勝利，實繫於全國上下之堅韌，整個國民經濟之鞏固；尤以後者為長期抗戰物質上之先决條件。</p>
<p>抑又進者，現代國際關係，錯綜複雜；兩國間之糾紛，輒足以啓有關係之第三國乃至整個世界之利害衝突。尤以素稱次殖民地之中國，向為列强角逐之戰場；日本對華戰爭，無疑為排斥歐笑在遠東之勢力，封鎖中國鬥戶，俾其獨自享受，故自九一八事變以來，中日糾紛。早成國際政治舞臺上之重頭演出。自七七事變演成八一三大戰，列强間雖因種種關係，未有積極之表演，但精神與物質上之對華同情與援助，已發生相作當用。尤以自日人獨吞中國之野心漸為世人洞察後之今日，更不能長此坐視，如英美今已先後對日提出强硬牒文，並毅然由對華精神上之同情，進而為物質上之援助；我國為獨立生存而奮戰，又有數百倍於日本之全國資源為後盾；國外資源之獲得與否，固不足以左右我抗戰之决心與操勝之實力；惟戰時之能獲得國外資源，究能使抗戰實力益見充實，何况我國產業落後，現代軍需工業又無基礎可言，故爭取海外資源，亦為抗戰偉業上不可或缺之程序。歐戰以美國之參戰而結束，表面上雖以協約國有此生力軍之加入而乃得擊潰疲敝之德軍，實質在於德國之貧乏資源，因此而更不能利用海外資源之彌補，以致促其迅速崩潰故耳。</p>
<p>吾政府有鑒於此，故戰爭之初，卽下令穩定金融，一方從事工業內遷，提倡工業合作運動，建設西南；啓發資源，整頓國內經濟。一方維持債信，承認門戶開放原則，表示歡迎外資，努力與友邦經濟上之合作，今抗戰一年有半，幣制穩固，經濟安定，各國輿論一致讚許者，良有以也。</p>
<p>（二）抵制侵略之國際的展開</p>
<p>夫抵制侵略，固在吾人堅决抗戰，至於最後之勝利，友邦人士，若能本正義人道之宗旨，與侵略者以經濟制裁之措施；則其為力，事半功倍，已如前述。故三八年初，比京之中國代表團發表抵制日本對華侵略之經濟條件如次：</p>
<p>（一）禁止供給日本軍需或工業原料，因日本之軍需及工業原料，大部仰給國外；若各國停止供給，卽限於少數主要項目，亦必與以嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>（二）抵制日貨與日船　本國際收支，端賴工業品出口及其航運收入，以為平衡；若各國抵制日貨及日船，則不徒可致其工業於死命，且將破壞其整個國民經濟。</p>
<p>（三）拒絕對日信用，日本戰費浩大，國內資源有限，非有外國信用，則自顧將不足，更何暇發展侵略之所得；若各國拒絕信用，不但使之不能和中日。日俄兩戰之獲利，且可以加强一·二兩點之幼力。</p>
<p>（四）相當少數國家之經濟措施，因日本原料信用之供給及其出口品之市場均集中於少數國家，此少數國家，包括美·英帝國·法及安雨·荷及東印度·比利時等·若與日經濟絕交，則日本卽將如魚失水，無可活躍。</p>
<p>（五）援助中國，所以加强中國抗戰能力，抵制國際侵略勢力，則凡愛好和平國家，亟宜擴展對華協助，廣行軍需及財政之接濟。</p>
<p>另一方面，三八年二月初國際執委會通過援助中國案，重申上届大會决議：請各國分別盡力援助中國。同時國際和平運動，於倫敦召開國際抵制大會，到二十國代表，一致通過抵制案：嚴懲侵略行為，嗣丈於巴黎召集國際和平運動大會，一致反對日本濫殺無辜人民，决議抵制日貨，停止軍需供給，鼓勵對華放款，並决議以倫敦之援華總會為國際援華運動之總樞紐；自同年十月起，該會且每月發行國際援華通信一次，藉以溝通及促進各地援華工作之展開，現由此等國際和平團體所支持國際援華工作，大致巳循下列三大路綫而前進：（一）督促各國政府，實施國聯對日制裁之决議案？（二）擴大抵制日貨運動，（三）捐款，捐藥品及衣物，救濟中國傷兵及難民。</p>
<p>（三）我國經濟外交之成就</p>
<p>前述援華工作，都係世界公正人士自動舉行，且皆以民間團體之形式而付之實施，不能視為我國經濟外交之收獲。其由我國政府所策動，而可視為經濟外交工作者，厥維爭取各國對華之財政援助是，目前各國中，最能與吾同情而又舉足輕重者，首推英美法三大民主國家。茲分別述之。</p>
<p>中美居太平洋兩岸，素稱友善，自華盛頓會議簽訂九國公約之後，益臻敦睦。當九一八事發變生，前國務卿史汀生曾力持正義，奔走呼籲，卒至國聯通過不承認案。三七年中日戰爭爆發，國人仰望於美國者甚深，美國輿論，雖有孤立派及絕對和平主義者之存在，然大抵斥責侵略，同情抗戰，尤其目光稍遠，如史汀生氏，及上海萬國敎堂牧師羅高克Emory　Lucck　D．ochD等更一致提　中日戰軍中美國之道德責任，主張有所積極行為。著名遠東評論家文弗爾Nathanidl　Pleffer觀中國抗戰一年之結果，亦變更其孤立主義之原來立楊，而倡議美人應與侵略國不合作：「不買（（日貨）不賣（軍需）不借（信用）」；同時又與不侵略國合作：予以各種便利），美國輿論之對華同情，由此可見，</p>
<p>戰後中美經濟關係之可注意者，為白銀問題，一為信用問題。</p>
<p>一九三四年美國開始購銀政策，抬高銀價，寢至中國無法維持銀本位制，於三五年十一月宜布停止銀本位制，採用管理匯兌制。三六年春、我國銀行家陳光甫氏銜命聘美，與美財長茅根韜訂立白銀協定，美國按白銀每兩值美金四角五分購取華銀五千萬兩。</p>
<p>三七年七月，第一屆中美協定期滿　其時孔財長出席英皇加冕盛典後使道遊美，乃續訂白銀協定，以銀易金，作吾國匯兌準備及出口信用担保之用。</p>
<p>三八年七月，協定又屆期滿；是月下句，日方飲佈謠言，謂英國有將中國金貨凖備改作國際共管之說。經美財長正式宣言，美國購買華銀協定，業已展期；條件大抵如舊。</p>
<p>據花旗銀行月刊八月號所載。二八年五月。中政府曾請美政府續購白銀，協助穩定中美貨幣關係，雙方卽成立轉期協定，約以中國白銀交換美元信用或黃金，三八年上半期，華銀運至紐約者計一億四千萬兩，值美金六千三百萬元自三七年十月起。共計運銀一億九千萬兩，值美金八千四百萬元，自一九三四年以來，美國購買中國白銀前後共達三億兩之譜，所得售價，一部分標出黃金，一部分作為銀行存欵。此為美國對華貨幣合作之一斑。</p>
<p>然戰爭之破壞無限，故非力事建設，啟發資源，不足以談長期之抗戰，更遑論戰後之復興，自有利用國外信用之必要。</p>
<p>三八年九月下旬，中國使節團抵美，仍由銀行鉅子陳光甫先生統領。一方與美實業界商談軍需供給及信用，一方與美政府作借欵商榷。</p>
<p>十月二十日，美財部宣言與中國使節團之商榷已有進步。</p>
<p>十二月十六日，中美二千五百萬美元之借欵告　、同時又有成立中英借欵之喜訊。此項信用，五年為期，純屬商業性質，大部將用於購買卡車及汽油云</p>
<p>中英　自全面抗戰發動，吾國沿海口岸均受威脅。天津上海，首當其衝。對外貿易重心，初則移於華南，賴杳港為唇齒。然廣州形勢，旦夕可危，卒至不保。故政府自始卽亟亟於另闢徯涇，洞開「後戶」，俾外來供給，及土產輸出，仍得流陽無阻。</p>
<p>滇緬公路，早有其議，而英方貫通長江上游貿易之心，蓄意亦久。然必待抗戰之推動，乃以數十萬人之日夜工作，不數月而全線完成，於三八年七月通車。於是中英經濟合作。得更進一步。</p>
<p>自滇緬公路通行，復盛傳英國將與借欵，建設滇緬鐵道。及日本公然推翻九國公約，提出所謂東亞新秩序一，明白排斥外商權益，英美方取聯合行動，有對日報復之議，十二月六日宇林西報倫敦消息，謂中政府計劃建設華西鐵道一千哩，已向英利茲Leeds公司定購鋼板車八五〇輛，並另定建築用鐵軌二十五哩，備先行接通昆明大理再謀擴展。</p>
<p>十二月十五日哈瓦斯社倫敦消息，確謂中英借欵已獲原則上協定，撥與中政府借款一千萬鎊，作下關（雲南近大理）至滇緬邊境鐵道建設之用，鐵路計劃，全由英商經理，並由出口祖保局協助之。然聞鐵路費用，僅六百萬鎊，餘四百萬鎊，可購其他鐵路材料及載重車用。此外又傳昨年英國貸華之信用，僅五十萬鎊，而最近成立之中英匯兌平準基金五百萬鎊新借欵，始為英國决以財力助華之先聲云。</p>
<p>英美借欵，雖係商業性質，然亦不無政治意味，故吾全國輿論一致歡迎，如歸納之，凡五點：（一）當此抗戰轉入第二時期之際，外國借欵，無論大小，均可鼓勵人民而而奮發士氣；（一）表明英美友誼；（三）鞏固吾人尊重債信之堅心。（四）其中政治性質，頗可注意；（五）勢必引起日方之反對，但吾人日益深信力足打破侵略者亞洲帝國之迷夢也。</p>
<p>中法中法國交，素極良好，據五月七月密勒氏評論報所載，「西南歡迎外賓」（作者Wong　Hin）文內，謂「有法國銀　，與川黔鐵路公司成立借款。鐵路管理，全歸川黔公司。僅於建築期內，聘兩法籍專家監督工程。一切村料，均於公開市場採辦之；借欵担保，由中國建設銀公司（完全華人經營）為惟一担保人。債務收支事宜，另由鐵路公司提名組織之債矜委員會協助保證之」。又據紐約著名之遠東雜誌Far　Eastern　Survev九月二十八日論法國在華權益文內，表示此項借款，計中國國幣三千四百五十萬元，其中七百萬元付現，餘二千七百五十萬購料云。</p>
<p>上項借款辦法，純為商叢之投資而革除任何附帶條件，實開中外經濟台作之先例。在西南鐵路　劃中，有自廣西南寗至越南邊境者，關係法人利益最重。今英美借款，已開其端，故法國卽有響應之說。</p>
<p>在戰爭破壞之中，而猶獲得列强之信用與援助，而日方對世界之活動，所得僅一致之斥責，此因為吾國戰時經濟外交之成就，實亦由於吾國之抗戰，乃係任何民族獨立生存上應有之使命；並為確保東亞和平，乃至世界和平，所必不可少之原素，是以世界各國對華戰時經濟之合作。宜其正節節進步中也。</p>

<p>漫話當年　康定古為三危之地，商周為西羌，漢為旄牛國，漢武帝建元六年置縣，隸靑海，蜀漢諸葛亮南征，遣郭達駐的通安撫，達於康定山中設鑪造箭，此打箭　命名之由來，晉屬西戎，唐隸吐番茶馬互市　交通日繁，五代至宋皆沿之，元屬西番長河西宣慰等司，明永樂五年，土司阿旺堅泰以隨征授為明正長，管轄魚通　玉兩土司，兼寗遠軍民宣慰使，司世職，淸康熙三十九年、，土司錫拉札克巴被藏官昌側集烈等戕害，經川督派兵平定，其子申勤忝德繼之，後改打箭　同知廳，隸　州府，所轄各土司。以明正為尊，光緒三十一年，駐藏幫辨大臣鳳全，因　愎自用，在巴塘被番衆戕害，淸廷以趙爾豐為邊務大臣，率師　逆，經年征服，光緒三十四年，打箭鑢改直隸廳，屬建昌道，總轄關外六糧道　宣統三年，將三土司地改流為縣，民元，尹昌衡督師西征，改打箭鑪為康定府，於府城設鎭撫府，分設各科，自任鎭撫使，統率各軍，管轄各縣，民二，因內政部劃一全國行政區域，改為康定縣，並將安良縣併入，本年元且，西康建省實現，卽以為省會，省政府設此，縣治仍舊，現置有康定市政委員會。西康內屬川滇，外控藏術，南通緬甸，北接靑海，自昔為西陲奧區，前淸末李，淸廷以康藏情勢危迫，外有强鄰窺何，內而邊民叛離，故特任趙爾豐為川滇邊務大臣，積極經營，籌備建省，趙以得中樞充分接濟，鄰省多方協助，辦理全邊改流事宜，軍威所至，番夷懾服，數年之內，共設三十餘縣，當時趙駐節巴安，以該邑氣候温和，物產豐富，且形勢重要，不啻邊南藩籬，卽擬設為首府，所有擬定建省計劃，胥以巴安為中心。川省及傳敎之英法各國人士赴巴者，風起雲湧，巴安已具省會雛形，　因淸廷顚覆藏番乖機內犯，康西十餘縣，相繼淪陷，而主持邊務之人，屢經更換，敷衍放任，每况愈下，馴至邊事日壞，廿四軍軍長劉文輝部接防後，卽以武力收復鄧柯，德格，白玉，石渠四縣，完成金沙江以東之統治局面、自抗戰展開以來，寇入益深，疆土日蹙，西康不特為西南之屏障，抑亦繫國際交通之重心，康定自昔　川藏交通根紐，今且為西康省會，軍事與政治，俱握衝要，遂形成西陲重鎭。</p>

<h3>義勇的慈善工作者　中國之友這中國（九）</h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>一方面因為有司令部的汽車之便，他方面由於梁科長的介紹說河西醫院裏有幾个在華服務的外國人。因此李蒙夫妻便想去看看他們。醫院是在韶關的曲江之西，因此大家都稱它為『河西醫院』。其實它眞正的名字乃是『循道醫院』。是英國的基督敎會倡辦的。汽車穿過了曲江上的木橋，順着傍江的公路，經過了六七分鐘之後，便到達了院門。四圍皆是大樹，靠山臨水，風景極為秀美。進院之後，一切裝置，設備，陳列都給我們一個潔淨齊整的印像。牆上掛了許多『妙手囘春』『華陀再世』……等的新式扁額，在鏡　的旁邊寫明是送給夏道熙醫師的。出意料之外，這位被稱為『華陀再世』的夏道熙竟就是我們所要見的外國醫士。他的英文名字是Roy　Horgetl對於這位『洋華陀』我便發生了非常的興趣。眞想不出他是个怎等樣的人物。過了一會，夏醫師來了，同我今天所遇到過的其他二個人一樣，第一眼我便注意到的是他的鼻標下面也有兩片小鬍子，而身材也不是高大的傢伙穿一套白色醫士制服，年裏拿着个煙斗，滿臉堆滿了笑容，眼睛不住靈活地向我們打量。一望而知這是个很精幹的角色。彼此互相做了自我介紹之後，夏道　先生乃請我們到他房前的走廊上去坐。走廊上舖一條薄薄的地毯，我們五人坐在圍繞着桌子的小籘椅上，桌上放着幾本英文雜誌和書報。好久不見這類東西了，偶然看見心內不免歡喜。夏先生還拿出兩本照相本給我們看，裏面有不少敵機轟炸韶關時從高空中直衝下來的姿勢，和許多被炸後的慘狀，有斷了腿的小孩子，有母子共死在一塊的死屍……看看令人感到毛髮直堅，滿心有說不出的憤恨，後來，夏醫師指着二架受傷後而停在機揚上的中國飛機，他說；「我們不能不佩服這機內駕駛者的英勇，沉着，這架飛機在南雄與敵人空戰的時候，雖然已勝利地擊下了敵人，然自己也受了相當的重創，照普通情理講，飛行員多半皆會為顧全自己起見而用飛行傘跳下來的，可是這位駕駛者竟還能以最大的勇敢把飛機帶回陣地，這種技術和此偉大的精神，的確是可以讓全世界飛行者尊敬的……。』他講得非常起勁，我們也聽得十分有趣，接着他說：『從韶關開始遭受到空擊以來，許多私辦的醫院便陸續關門了，剩下來就祗有一家軍醫院，和我們此地，軍醫院是祗看前綫受傷將士和軍人的，故一年以來在空擊中受傷的幾任平民完全皆在此地醫治，因為我們醫院的經費關係，所以對於病人還收相當的費用，連吃住在內，頭等病房是一塊錢一天，二等則為七毫五分國幣一日。為了這個緣故，許多十分貧困的人，還是無法住院，這點，我們是感到很不安，然而就是無能為力的事體。……』這位『華陀再世』的外國醫士說得很對，在這時期中，一方面固然是服務，他方面實在也是學習，他說：『轟炸中平民受傷的情况十分不一樣，如果單憑以往在學校裏所學的話，那無論如何是無法應付的，在新時代中醫病眞須要努力研究而利用各種不同的方法。在這一年中，我見到了許多意想不到的受傷方式，因此也學習了許多新的醫治方法……』，對於醫學，我與李蒙夫婦皆為完全的『門外漢』故除了靜坐着留心聽，像一個小學生上課似地之外，實在無從抽嘴，我覺得他的經騐的確是非常寶　的。當此中國處於大時代怒潮中的時候，不單是醫生，就是各界人物，都須要抱一面服務一面學習的精神，否則，時代的轉變太快，環境的改移太多，單憑舊方法是决計應付不了新需求的。</p>
<p>談得正高興的時候，扶梯　了，接着跑上來一個很英俊的金髮的外國男郎，他和夏道熙一樣，也能講一口很好的道地廣東話，，在中國的時間，他還比夏道熙多兩年，他已經足足有九年之久了。夏起來巷我們一一介紹，他是此地英國敎會裏的牧師，名字叫做W．H．Alton，中國名字是區道弼。這位先生講話時的姿態十分講究，大有好萊塢的風度。和他頭髮的顏色一樣，兩片小鬍子，也是金黃色的，旣疏又軟，樣子很有趣。我心中暗地忖着，今天怎麼這樣奇怪，會到的人都一概有兩片鬍子，莫非這是韶關的風水吧！傭人招呼夏道熙說『茶點已預備好了！』我們遂跑進客廳，那裏陳列得頗為精緻，茶點亦十分講究，有很好的罐頭牛乳，方糖，蛋糕，據說多是從杳港來的。</p>
<p>茶點渦後，夏偕　們同去參觀病房，藥房，……房間雖不多，大約能容納五六百人而已，可是那種井井有條，十分齊整的樣子看了令人可愛。此地除，道熙之外，所有醫士，看護皆為中國人，他們的感情很好，技術亦佳，據夏說這些看護的水準不下於英國許多大醫院內的護士。後來我們還去參觀一個看護的臥房。滿屋是雪白的一片，牆上掛着顯利鄧波兒（譯音請改用最普通常用的）和夏道熙的照片，這童星天眞的笑容，使這房子裏的空氣格外輕鬆活潑起來，我想如果把這美麗姑娘的房間配在中國整個情况的書面之上的話，那眞像一對洋溢着生動的情緒和美觀色調的蝴蝶，飛舞在充滿着火藥氣的砲口周圍。出了這「小天堂』之後，在對面便可看見許多久已無人使用的火爐灶，據說從前家屬可以陪伴病人進院，這些爐灶就是供給病人家屬替病人做菜之用，現在因為院中人擠，病人的家屬不能住院，故這些爐灶，也就逐漸荒蕪了！用具室裏有許多新的玻璃櫃，及醫藥用具，我們驚奇地問　道熙，「現在交通如此困難，這些東西如何運來的呢？」他囘答我們；『這完全是當地的工人自己做的。』在抗戰中學習，工人們的技術也很快地進步了。我們與院中的看護　生們同拍了一張照，然後與這位義勇的慈善工作者握手道別，臨行時我要這位「中國之友」替我們國際新聞社寫篇文章，以他的工作經騐為題村，他答應了，並且說『明日交卷』。</p>

<h3>新會失陷之前後</h3>
<p>— 何錫堯</p>
<p>（一）失陷前的情況</p>
<p>自大良容桂相繼失陷，×人進攻的路綫，明顯地是有控制五邑的企圖，但是新會縣府當局和民衆，在這嚴重悄形，仍是異常鎮靜，三月廿八日新會的民衆還是過着安靖的日子，商人照常做生意，學生如常上學，那時僅是當地的軍隊和義勇警察，稍露緊張的動態。當日晚十時左右，就聽到北街外海猪頭山發現×蹤的消息，知道事情來得不妙，許多人都奔走探問，看是眞是假，也有不少人開始徬徨和焦急了。這時因為情形告急，當局就凖備疏散人口，商店也開始僱船搬運貨物，但是因為時已深夜，做不得什麽事，所以就大多數人等待到明天，不過也有少數人連夜趕程回鄉去了。廿九日是黃花紀念節早晨，事態已嚴重萬分，路上擁塞着逃難的人羣，携老抱幼，衣冠凌亂不整，行色倉皇，多數僅携帶些棉胎和幾件日常的衣服。江門新會各商店，有的閉門掩戶，有的却祗半開，生息幾乎停頓了。那天有×機十四五架不斷地在江門上空盤懸，炸彈不停地在江門會城附近矗響，動輒百餘枚，逃難的人們就不安地忖測着江門會城不幸命運到來了。這一天，人們只得在整天轟炸下逃生，江門新會的公路交通，已自動破壞焚燬，只有各鄉的石路可以通行。來往各鄉的船渡都擁擠不堪，自己僱船逃生的不計其數。在這一天中，江鬥新會疏散的人口已超過五成了。卅日，江門已不幸失守，會城中來不及逃走和自己鎭靜仍未想逃走的人們，這時都陸續逃到鄉下去了。會城巳變成一座死城。</p>
<p>但是在這裏要特別指出的，就是江門和會城在未失陷之前一點鐘，各路口均由義勇警察守護着，治安還是很好。卅一日，會城巳聽到炮聲了，但是最使人奇怪的，就是那時仍有些小販做着生意，菜攤猪肉檯都還擺在街市上；不過，米則成為珍貴的物品了。四月一日，槍炮聲就越來越淸晰。四月二日晨，炮聲震耳欲聾，人們就預料到會城近郊，已發生接觸了。到上午十一點鐘左右，會城繼江門之後，宜告失守。下午兩三點鐘的光景，×人的裝甲車竟已駛進會城各馬路。</p>
<p>（二）一個小隊長的談話</p>
<p>記者于會城失陷時，卽冒雨逃到鄉間，在這裏會見了新順特務大隊的一個小隊長，記者卽叩詢我軍抗戰的經過，因為新會此次抗戰，新順特務隊建立了不少光榮的戰蹟。茲錄其報告的情形如下：</p>
<p>我們這次抗×，支持了江門和會城三四日，已經犧牲了不少的弟兄，要是沒有漢奸引導或內應，我們這些雖然拙劣的槍械，自信還可以支持下去的，這些漢奸多是小數地痞流氓之類，這想是我們的政治動員工作的不够吧。</p>
<p>可是周長官對着全隊弟兄泣哭似的說：我們這樣失了江門太不值了，當時我也幾乎哭了出來，其後，周長官卽令我們和義勇警隊死守白沙防綫，我們更具决死之心，竭力使×人不能衝過，但是，他們終於利用裝甲軍衝過來了，裝甲車一共十二架，後面還跟着幾百騎兵隊。我們為了保持實力起見，迫得退出第一防線，固守着第二防線的都會鄉了。在那裏，我們利用有利的地形，架置機槍，趕築防禦工事，那時我們連義警也僅有××百人，當天晚上，就由李務滋司令長官訓令東甲各鄉壯丁鋤燬都會至掛寶廟的一段公路，但因為時間急速，連夜開工只　了一半的路程，為的是鋤毀這段公路，阻止×人裝甲車前進，保安隊不久就趕來增援。在都會鄉的山裏架了兩架大砲，隆隆的向×陣發砲了。×人的死傷想是不少，在這條防線，×軍雖幾次增援，經過四次的衝鋒，也不能衝破。但是最使我們感到興奮的，就是李務滋長官，他為了抗×，整夜沒有合過眼，親自督師。</p>
<p>後來，在狂風大雨之下，我們陷于不利的境地，我們知道非要拚命不可，就上了刺刀衝鋒過去，因為×人得裝甲車和騎兵的掩護，我們搏殺×偽軍數百，方忍痛退出，轉移陣地，堅守會城東門。但支持不久，×兵又從惠民門包抄過來，我們不得不忍痛沿着公路退回大澤等地，準備及時反攻。說來這次犯江門的×人多是雜牌軍隊，戰鬥力極弱，×人來時，裝甲車當先，騎兵隊其次，跟尾的便是這些雜牌軍隊。</p>
<p>（三）新會的悲劇</p>
<p>卅日失了江門，長堤一帶商店，因為事起倉卒，貨物搬運不出，多被刻掠。晚間河南　頭麻園近鄉的地痞狗盜，乘時而起，劈門毀戶，就算床板傢私，也　過淸光。因為搶的多，有的用艇搬，有的用軍拖，生油與花生大豆，隨地傾瀉，据說蓬江一伙伴，因×人强要他找不到姑娘而被槍殺了。在北街的情形也是一樣，可幸×人來時，許多婦女都走光。會城失陷後，其情形一如江門城裏各商店，間有被搜刼，但不多，最厲害的是產　街，因為近河所以給隣近地痞土匪，從後門而入，用艇搬運賊物，但是因為會城失陷較遲，各商店稍有餘　可搬貨物，損失較少一些。有人看守門戶的較勝一點，無人看守，便多劈毀。各馬路均由×軍或偽軍握守，行人見之須行鞠躬禮，袋裏有一角幾分，也被搜去。會城初陷一二天，到處拉夫，抬死屍，塡公路，築工事，工作完畢，便給一兩角，這種混亂狀態，我們可以看到×人何等利誘我民衆，和我們對于動員民衆工作的重要，而且在淪陷之前後，流氓地痞之行刦，是一種痛心的情形，這還不能不認為是政治上的一大敎訓。在第二期抗戰中，蔣委員長宣示：「政治重于軍事，宜傳重于作戰」，這是我們應該加倍努力的。</p>
<p>×挺進隊現佔駐岑日初大廈，×騎兵駐大雲山平民醫院，縣政府則改為×司令部，警衛森嚴，日間八時許始准通行，下午六時卽不許出入，晚間，便是盜賊世界。×軍更唆使挺進隊佈告安民，一派胡言，因為民衆不受欺騙，于是勒令商店復業，否則將某財產充公，有些舖戶，存一些貨，不得不張門半開，×軍為恢復繁榮，更施些小惠小數　民，買米有時一兩角錢可買七八升，大新街南天茶樓，×軍給了幾包　紛叫伙伴營業，大新路南隅路一帶賭場林立，沿路商店有人看守的，便被迫命懸　×旗，書有『歡迎大日本皇軍』字樣。</p>
<p>日來×軍忙築防禦工事，城郊各處。均堆疊沙包，如西河口，大雲山等處均駐×兵，不許通過，現在我軍在某處準備反攻，在這反攻軍事進展中，我們是更須要克服過去攻治動。工作不够的錯誤，因為我們能够把民衆動員起來，一切漢奸才可以消滅，一切地痞盜賊才可以肅淸，而且也可以建立强大的民衆武力，把×人趕出新會的，×人巳日趨潰滅了，新會的軍民們，切實起來吧！克服我們的錯誤，展開英勇的血戰，保衛我們的家鄉！</p>

<h3>麻布大山之戰　（報告二）</h3>
<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>直到三月二十日、第三營的弟兄們沒有遇到强有力的抵抗、可隨時準備予敵以强有力的打擊、五個月　補充和訓練、卽是一個補充兵、也　着了一個久經戰陣的「老兵」的氣質、溶合着飽和的戰意、他們　索着、當地的老百姓也搜索着、到處為我們的眼睛、遍地是我們的網羅、弟兄們每天都領着不遠數里或十餘里帶來了敵情的農民、到無名的小村裏來對程營長報告、參觀各方蒐集來的諜報、知道在三個據點裏的敵人總數不到二千人、岳　城廂的×兵也不過四百人、程營長决定把兩個連的力量、以俯衝的姿勢進攻郭鎮市、以一個連充預備隊、在毛里舖附近警戒×軍從新開塘方面而來的右翼迂迥</p>
<p>×　自知兵力單薄、却企圖各個擊破進攻中的我軍、三月卅一日上午十時、×人在郭鎮市以南結集兵力一千三百人、附炮十門增援、向進至麻布大山北麓的我軍逆襲、程營長立卽命令各連佔領優勢地形、待機進擊、</p>
<p>參加過幾次戰役的士兵們、覺得在自己頭上有着目由的領空的戰爭不能說是戰爭、各人自信有足够的力量對付×人、覺得將有一個偉大的成就就在眼前、他們在忪林裏、山溝裏、×火的死角下、仔細地蔭蔽起來、單露出一個圓黑的槍口、</p>
<p>×人的砲兵開始射擊了、不到一刻鐘、就是一百多發、程營長坐在一二兩連間的後方不遠處、靜觀着敵彈的碰炸、他的眼睛露出了笑意、覺得×方的砲兵射擊又退步了、不是　越就是不及、他撿起在他背後墮下的砲彈碎片、發現有「昭相十三年三月造」的字樣、「哈哈、看你　多少砲彈」、他不禁笑出聲來、</p>
<p>砲彈不斷在陣地的左右前後爆炸、塵士和硫磺火藥的氣息和着、有些是燒夷彈、使春之野的草木也一處處燒燎起來、士兵們一手握着槍、一手就近攀折松枝撲火、一等兵王遠明的胸前飛進了一大塊碎片、他打開軍衣、用手將它拉了出來、把軍衣緊緊的塞住創口、繼續把充滿着血的眼睛注視着匐匍前　的×人、用抖動的右手握緊手溜彈、把左手揭開保險蓋、</p>
<p>第一連和第二連的陣地前、各有着一個死角、可是互相瞭望得到、當×人進人第一連的死角時、第二連的弟兄們便大聲叫着、「第一連日×××躱在你們的陣地下面、快撩手溜彈」、於是第一連的弟兄們　拉動保險絲、「一、二、三、」一齊擲下、第二連又喊着、「好、死了五個、還有八個活王八啦」、又是一陣「朋」「朋」、「皇軍」就發出一陣哼聲、眞像「龜太郎」似的死了、當×人挨近第二　時、第一連的弟兄、也同樣的叫喚、做了「皇軍」的喪鐘、</p>
<p>×軍的機關槍手慣用着「達、達、達、」的三發點放、意思是說、一怕不怕」我們的捷克式機關槍立刻用「達、達、」的兩發點放來回答他說、』不怕、」接着又問他、「怕不怕！」各個射擊也開始了、狙擊手張慶祥和一個鬼子兵對射着、各不相讓的在百公尺內你發我躱、我發你躱的打了十多槍、最後張慶祥不耐煩了、他不再躱避、相互同時射擊、這一槍之後、對方就沒有再抬起頭來、他重又選擇另一個目標射擊、老張是一個常打三十環（註）的好射手、這次他射中了第十三個×人之後掛了彩、</p>
<p>迫擊砲手李化龍是山東人、力大如牛、他把炮筒從架子上拿下來、挾在脅下、另叫一個弟兄在前面觀測、專對×人的機關槍轟擊、一氣三四十發、把×軍的機關槍手打得只恨沒有地洞鑽、他打得太興奮了、不防有一顆×人的砲彈貫穿了地的胸脯、就像小山樣地倒了下去、他流血太多、喘息着說：『好弟兄、我已經划得來、我不中用了、請給我補一槍吧！』程營長含着淚爬過去、看他腸子也流出來了、沒有希望得救、就忍痛叫弟兄補上一槍、立卽派担架抬往後方安埋。</p>
<p>陝西寶鷄的一個十八歲的『好小子』、弟兄們　只他「小鷄」、他也不計較他的眞姓名、兩條小腿上中了五顆機關槍彈、弟兄們勸他下去、他氣憤地說：「為什麽不許我殺鬼子、我還有八顆手溜彈、誰呌下去就先炸死誰！」他用了兩顆、炸死了九個×人、終於不支倒了下去、</p>
<p>劇烈的戰鬥延長到下午四時、在我方陣前的×屍已不下二百多、×人重又開始以砲兵協助步兵攻擊、十門砲同時瘋狂地發射着、連山岳也動搖起來、程營長料　這是×人最後五分鐘的掙扎、紫膛色的面上泛出油黑的光彩。他站起喊道、「弟兄們、怕不怕、」</p>
<p>接著是一陣、『不怕！』的怒吼、</p>
<p>『不怕的就　、』　　長向　　、　（未完）</p>

<h3>關南游擊軍印象記（下）　（續十四日）</h3>
<p>他願意供　自己的力量、打出一個獨立自由的新中國來！他領導的那些健兒，同樣是值得　佩的，他們走出了工廠課堂田莊，英勇地走上抗日戰場，他們流出來的熱血，將會灌漑出一朶自由的鮮花</p>
<p>我們對于這些保衛祖國的戰士，除了愛戴與擁護外，更願站在抗日同志的立場上，提出以下的幾點的熱望：</p>
<p>高處長說：「關南游擊軍的軍紀。正是中外名將的用兵法，這種寶貴的經驗應該發揚光大起來」；不過我們要進一步的認識到此次對日抗戰與別的戰爭不同；以前的戰爭多是為了一家一人的好大喜功，戰爭的目的是不敢告訴軍隊和民衆的，因此只有嚴刑峻　去强制執行。此次戰爭是為了驅逐日×出境建立自由幸福的新中國，同時也是為了日本人民大衆的解放和世界的正義和平而戰。這個光明磊落的戰爭目的，不但要三番五次的告訴給抗日戰士，同時還要給落後的民衆作詳細的解釋，更要設法向×偽軍作深入而廣泛的宣傳，我們今天和×人單拚武器是拚不　的。只有運用這種政治戰爭，內而把官兵民衆都造成具有高度政治認識的戰土，使官兵一體，軍民合作；外而瓦解×偽軍的士兵，使他們一同站在革命的戰綫上，和我們　起手來，才能戰勝兇惡的×人！比方逃跑的現象吧，只要我們政治—作做到，叫跑也不跑了，就是偶然有少數逃跑的，我們仍可用　治說服他，所以今天治軍，政治工作是第一位，　刑峻法只是起着　叻作用，事實上也惟有把政治工作做好，軍紀才能維持得住。高處長說：一我們已有政訓處了。」這是值得慶幸的一件事。我們相信在杜司令領導下，很快就能建立起很好的政治工作。高處長又特別提出了過去　和各方面有過不諒解之處，言下萬分表示遺憾。我們認為對日抗戰「不但一個跑得快，還須要大家跟得上！」因為抗日的工作是艱鉅的。惟有發動全民族的努力，才能底于成功，關南游擊軍的全體官兵，抗戰情緒萬分商漲，恨不得把×子打走，新中國馬上就出現，所以對待崁衆機關團體和友軍，有些地方便持了一種急躁的態度。可是歷史積習是不易改掉的，社會關係更是複雜的，每一個作救亡工作的人，惟有把握住「抗日高於一切，一切服從抗日」的最高原則，用一種禮讓而謙誠的態度，對待民衆團體機關友軍，才能互相帮助，共同發展，團結精誠，減少磨擦，一致全力對待共同的×人——日本×國主義。高處長說：「我們已有教訓處，從此可以和各方面接頭了！」是的，我們相信政治工作，是可以克服一切困難的。</p>
<p>以上兩段話，就作為我對關南游擊軍的贈言吧。其實這些贈言恐怕早已作了事實的尾巴，因為我們所敬愛的關南游擊軍全體官兵，在杜司令領導下，早經向這個標的邁進了。　（民革社）</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>請看中國！</h3>
<p>本港英文士蔑晚報昨日著論『請看中國』，詳述中國與歐局關係，並極力讚揚我軍最近反攻的威力，我們認為應加注意的是：</p>
<p>第一，它證明友邦人士對於中國抗戰力量的新的認識與信，它指出國際形勢將愈趨於　有利的前途，它反證了少數的「和平」妥協調解論調實在不適於今日中國！</p>
<p>第二，它證明日×漢奸們最近謠傳英駐華駐日大使食談係在協解調解中戰戰事一說為無　謠言，他還指正正在赴渝途中的英駐華大使寇爾氏，不僅絕元『調解』用意，而且將　應歐局而將有助于中英友誼關係的增進。國際反侵略陣線正在發展，我們冉要澈底粉碎×奸妥協調解的謠言與陰謀！</p>
<p>第三，它更指出過去中國抗戰二十餘月，造成了可獲世界欽敬的成績，但是中國這種偉大的成就，完全是依賴自力的成就，所獲外援實至微弱。因此它呼籲如果民主和平各國今後能予中國以積極的支持，則日本侵略者將不值一戰，這也是事實，我們必須加緊爭取民主和平各國的更大更多的同情與援助！</p>
<p>請看中國！它巳從空前艱敝的血戰中壯大超來，它將不用憂慮×人和　日漢奸一切反共和平的煙幕和調解的鬼計—我們每一個不願做奴隸的中國人更應增强自信，堅决擁護團結抗戰！</p>

<h3>我各路大軍進展神速　廣州指日可下　廣州市內隱聞砲聲　西江之×力圖固守</h3>
<p>【廣州沙面外訊】我東北兩路大路軍、連日來大舉向粵垣猛攻、進展神速、自增城克復、軍威大振、第四戰區司令張發奎氏、爲一鼓光復廣州計、特親至前綫指揮、北路軍事、則由十二集團軍總司令余漢謀氏親率大軍向南挺進、經數日之劇戰、×不支、紛紛潰退、現我前鋒已逼近廣州、距離粵垣只十餘里、十六晚市面且聞砲聲、廣州之×紛紛開赴前綫增援、近郊防務、由偽軍李和義祖任、市內只餘少數憲兵及自警團維持而已</p>
<p>東路戰況</p>
<p>日增　克復後、我即乘勝向石壠石灘方面之×進逼、於是遂與×再度激戰、劇烈之情、為數月來所未有、旋我大隊援軍趕至、向×三面夾擊、×遂不支、紛紛向石龍方面潰退、我遂將×包圍、經此一役、將×各綫之聯絡、完全切斷、現與花縣之我軍取得聯絡、大舉向廣州反攻、</p>
<p>北路戰況</p>
<p>自我再度克復新街後、×因側背受我夾擊、致首尾失聯絡、遂紛向江村、石井潰退、我遂分軍兩路、一由沿粵路南進、直逼郭塘、江村而趨廣州、一由新街東出迂迴而南攻、各路軍經一日夜之血戰、（十六）晨已完成大包圍廣州之勢、×軍異常惶恐、紛調西江之×囘固粵垣、以圖最後扎、現廣州市內秩序、極形混亂、游擊隊常於各地發現、</p>
<p>西江戰況</p>
<p>我西江各路軍、經鄧龍光氏連日積極佈置、及桂軍東下援助後、軍心益振、近以我東北兩路軍反攻軍事節節勝利、遂乘勢向×軍猛烈反攻、寧陽江佛兩綫戰事、極形劇烈、　莊附近戰況尤烈、血戰一晝夜、斃×數百餘人、至十六晨仍在激戰中　棠下一帶各高地、已為我克復、×已受我重大威脅、大　、河村一帶×軍、因迭遭我軍民通擊、傷亡慘重、大有顧此失彼之勢、昨日乃四出強拉民伕、邦同建築工事。以圖死守、故四邑戰事轉趨沉寂云、</p>
<h3>東江軍事增廣間戰事仍烈　我前鋒部隊與×僅隔一河　石灘×軍馳援增城被痛擊</h3>
<p>【東江快訊】東江我軍於十五日克復增城後、爲掃蕩殘×、旋卽派部分頭向潰竄增廣及增灘兩公路×軍追擊、因此又在廣增公路之朱村一帶、與×發生激戰、消息已誌昨報、　續誌軍情如下、</p>

<p>石灘×軍馳援鍜羽</p>
<p>又查是日、被我追擊之×軍當時勢勞異常危殆、據石灘×軍遂傾巢其千餘人、迂迴增城西南。企圖夾擊我軍、以解增灘會廣兩路之圍、我軍據報、卽密逍某部暗伏亭子岡附近、嚴陣以待、移時×果以坦克車前導、附馬隊二百餘、掩護大隊×步兵風馳疾進、我軍俟×迫近、一聲號令、四面出擊、與遂×軍發生激戰、×軍藉戰單掩護、來勢頗兇、然卒不能衝破我軍穩重之陣線、鏖戰數小時、×軍　被擊潰、是役激戰結果、×我傷亡均重、現我大軍已陸續開至某某一帶防堵×軍、準備×如來犯卽迎頭痛擊、</p>
<p>池王限期攻下石龍</p>
<p>負責東江下游之東南岸司令池中寬、翟榮基、及第四區游擊縱隊司令王若周、以我大軍　克復　垣、佔據優勢、東莞×軍確已根本搖動、再加壓迫、必可得手、查石龍爲東線最突出之　、×軍防守不易、遂决從此路進兵、十三日特下令上下南山、杉排頭、及廣九線之團隊、繼續前進、限期攻下石龍、我團隊奉令後、冒雨前進、前鋒部隊午後已抵達水南及王屋洲地方、查該處距石龍鎮僅隔一河、聲音可聞、×軍舉動可以目睹、盤據石龍之×、已將所有橋樑、一律破壞、阻我渡河反攻、同時並以鋼砲密集、向我軍陣地轟擊、企圖頑抗、樟木頭塘頭厦可聞砲聲、</p>
<p>張發奎電勗梁寶仁</p>
<p>又查×軍爲牽制我反攻東莞石龍之兵、日前曾派步兵三百、分乘電船汽艇廿餘艘、向實安進犯、第四區縱隊司令部第四大隊梁實仁率部奮勇迎擊、將×軍擊潰、並斃其指揮官甬田少佐、及×官兵十餘、奠定寶安、掃除我大軍側面威脅、厥功甚偉、第四戰區司令長官張發奎據報、以梁氏指揮有方、殊堪嘉許、昨特電勗梁氏、勉以繼續努力、現杳×軍自進犯寶安、慘遭痛懲後、日來均蟄伏太平、不敢妄動、故寳安防務、異常安謐、各區鄉民、均紛紛動員、準備協助我軍反攻云</p>
<h3>番禺壯士痛擊漢奸　僞縣長陳某暫五六刀　僑鄉長戴某因傷斃命</h3>
<p>【番禺通訊】番禺縣自淪陷後、×人卽嗾使漢奸醜類、在各佔領區鄉組織偽維持會、幷拉　土劣黎某、出任僞縣長、成立僞縣府、實行其「懷柔政策」、以圖麻醉我各鄉民眾、惟最近各該鄕民衆及附近游擊隊、異常活躍、時予×軍襲擊、各區鄉秩序因而紊亂不堪、負責該縣×方、以僞縣長及各傀儡無法維持秩序、除將一部份僞維持會愧儡拘禁懲辦外、幷决定撤換該僞縣長、該縣羣醜聞此消息、企圖出而逐鹿、乃紛紛向×献媚、及進行拉　各區鄕偽維持會傀儡、向×引薦、因此連連來、各羣醜漢奸、向各方奔走拉　、異常忙碌、該縣一區石樓鄉僞鄉長陳某、於本月十一日下午六時、在該鄉仲明學校設妻、請該縣×人及各區鄉傀儡首腦、詎被該鄉靑年壯士偵悉、乃召集二十餘人、潛入該校附近之大井頭街一帶、候至晚夜、九時許、羣醜散席、扶醉由該校而出、行抵大井頭時、潛伏該處靑年、即乘其不意、舉刀向陳逆亂劈、手起刀落、竟將陳逆斬至重傷、各同行傀儡狼狽逃遁、又被潛伏荔枝圍之靑年包圍痛毆、該傀儡等大呼求救、絕無應者、旋各靑年以目的已達、遂從容逸去、後聞被擊傷者、除陳逆被斬五六刀手脚等各部重傷外、幷有傀儡五六人被毆重傷、其中一名、係附近赤山鄉僞鄉長戴某、　因傷斃命、自經此役後、該處漢奸惶恐異常、有如驚弓之鳥、入夜不敢外出、幷乞求×方多派×兵保護、其情形至屬可憐可笑云、</p>
<h3>李漢魂關注民眾　派員出巡游擊區　頒訓令六項嚴厲杜絕流弊　杜訓隊改組為國民自衛隊</h3>
<p>【韶關快訊】在此第二期抗戰爭取主動戰當中、粵省府主席兼軍管區司令李漢魂、對武裝民衆、備極關注、尤其對軍民合作、在反攻軍事上、所佔之價値、更爲重視、故决將全粵游擊隊加以整理、經派員赴各區督導、同時幷將社訓隊重新改組、使實力增厚、以期必勝、</p>
<p>督察員出巡　李氏爲整理游擊隊起見、除訓令各區督察專員切實就近指導外、幷派出蘇玉泉、吳駿聲、余祖明、徐軍雁、劉岸、沈梓卿、彭濟義、馬達三、楊國鈞等出巡視察各隊伍之實力、幷協助當地長官組織與訓練、</p>
<p>訓令共六項　查各督察專員奉命後、均經分道出巡、俾迅速到達各區工作、李主席于各督察員出發前曾發出訓令六項、一、私擅籌款、圖飽私囊、或妨碍國省稅收、二、憑藉武力、包庇烟賭、三、虛報名額、瞞領餉糈、四、領到款項、不照發給、五、藉編入自衛團反抗徵兵、六、恃勢橫行、武斷鄉曲者、均决嚴予查究、幷飭所屬縣市自衛團辦理情形、隨時報吿、以資攷成、</p>

<h3>廉城被炸損失調查　共投十七彈　燬民房多間</h3>
<p>【南路通訊】日前此間空襲警報頻仍、×機每成羣掠過領空、進襲滇桂兩省、九日上午八時許、防空指揮部又發警報、×機八架、由圍洲方面起航、分批飛三娘灣、乾體等處偵察、至十時二十分、卽掠入廉城市空投彈、我防空部隊當卽開槍仰擊、×機亦開機槍還擊、結果共投彈十七枚、縣民因事前躱避、幸無傷亡、查中彈地點及損失如下、城外欽州巷街第三次路炸共中二彈、一中鎭興社左旁空地、一彈中鍾家祠左旁、僅死鷄二隻、餘無損失、大北　第四次被作、共中三彈、第七號鄧宅及第九號李宅中一彈、二宅被燬、第七號吳宅中座亦波及塌倒、十八號蔣宅後園空地中一彈、燬圍牆數幅、尙有一彈中竹園後尾、燬屋二間、中山路縣立四小中座中一彈、全燬校務處傳達室震燬、另震燬隣近住屋數間、德國德華小學再度遭刦、操場中一彈、圍墻被燬、幷波及一小女、中山公園空地中一彈、無損失、城外下街廿三號鄺宅一旁中一彈、中座全燬、後座震燬、廿一號黃宅中一彈、前中座均燬、上倉口花姓住宅中一彈、共燬平民住宅多間、殘垣斷壁、情形極慘、此外尙小賓興復尾中一彈、廚房被燬、康樂路譚宅中一彈、無損失、又西湖塘街羅宅中一彈、燬商店二宅數間、惠通　中一彈、廳房被燬、並震住宅數間、小北街四號余家祠中一彈、穴深丈、闊二丈餘、全座悉成焦土餘、幷波及住宅數間、鍾鼓樓市場四十二號楊宅中一彈　僅燬住屋數間</p>
<h3>汕頭疏散老弱婦孺　月杪疏散完畢　舟車一律半價</h3>

<h3>江門失陷的教訓（續）</h3>
<p>— 宇雲</p>
<p>政工人員本身組織的不健全、所以臨陣退縮了、至於其他的公務人員呢、亦有同樣的弊病、戰　發生幾天後、又發現幾個區長逃亡了、說起政治機構的腐化、早就給我們看透了的、我們可以舉出一個例證、我們若不是健忘、當記得港報曾登載過一段『扣留運儎慰勞品電船』的新聞、因船內除儎慰勞品外、還有其他布疋糖麵等貨甚夥、無人認領、有走私嫌疑、我想、別的暫不提、至少公務人員也兼任「逐什一之利」了、還有什麼工夫去做動員民衆的工作呢、其次、我們曉得各鄉徵兵的情形、固然不少是買人頂替、但辦理徵兵的　關、在檢查被徵壯丁的資格時、諸多留難、若「以錢代人」、便「毫無疑問」了、</p>
<p>新會政治動員的不够、還有其他的原因、誰都知道、在廣州失陷時、或許是因爲軍費給養問題、曾經弄出一揚開賭、截留稅款、抽收抗戰費二十萬等把戲、其後由賢明當局逐漸取締了、但可惜當漸入「佳境」之時、×人已登堂入室了、</p>
<p>筆者不覺　新會的黑暗面說了一大堆、但新會畢竟是富庶之區、在從前爲防範土匪計、民槍購置了不少、民性勇悍、如果民團的組織嚴密、當能發揮很大的威力、在此反攻節節勝利中、我們希望當局迅速改善新會的政洽動員工作、保衛西江南路的相紐——江門。</p>
<h3>電影也戲劇　郭培爾閑情逸致　德宣傳部長自我宣傳　年內決監製影片一部</h3>
<p>德宣傳部長郭培爾、決在本年內親自監製一部影片、劇本也已擬定、片名暫定為『有力量的愛好和平者』、內容當然一方面是誇張德國人民對於和平貢獻的努力、另一方面則竭力把猶太人描寫成一個極貪婪極卑鄙的民族、在劇本中有二個主要的角色、全是跛足者、一個是雅里安禮人、他因為跛足成了富翁、而另一個有猶太血統的人、卻因跛足而成了乞丐、有人說、『這是郭培爾一部自我宣傳影片』、因為郭培爾自己也是一個有純粹雅里安血統的跛足者、</p>
<h3>與影星通電話　—難於上青天—</h3>
<p>好來塢是一個充滿了『錯誤的電話號碼的城市』、</p>
<p>要想打通一個電話到明星的家裏、實在比駱駝穿過針眼還難呢、</p>
<p>要打個電話給美國的大總統得到一個回答、並不是十分困難的事、至少、總統不親自囘答、也可以得到書訊的答覆、但是要想打個電話到達瓊白郞黛兒的耳際、倒是十二分困難、她非但時常搬着家、不斷的還　她的電話號碼、而且她在家的時間　非常少非常少、</p>
<p>數年前有一個體面的靑年某某、並沒有怎樣的固定職業、可是他的生活竟非常舒適、他唯一的方法是同人打賭、說他能打電語給居住在荷蘭的德國皇帝通話、他的確打過一兩次、但是如果叫他打電話給埃洛弗林、就會難倒他了呢、埃洛弗林的電話號碼對於他的經理人和最親密的朋友也嚴守秘密的</p>
<p>你可以吿訴電話接綫員說你想同美國煤油大王講話、或者有希望得到囘答、但是同一個接綫員會簡單的對你說她不能接通詹姆士賈克奈、因爲、『這位定戶叮囑我們不要把他的號碼洩露』。</p>
<p>電影明星只用電話同他們的經理人通話、經理人能不把委托他的明星的電話號碼吿訴人家、可得一點特別的報酧、幾年前温毛立司、還只是一條澳洲船上的侍者、那船離海岸四千英里時、要打電話給他也比現在打到好萊塢給他容易多、</p>
<p>有人熟悉好萊塢的情形、如果知道某明星在那一家餐室裏的話、他可以打電話到那餐館、叫那個明星接聽、倒是多數不會拒絕的、</p>
<p>只有快到合同滿期的時候、影人們肯讓他的電話號碼給別人知道、但是一到簽了兩年、五年或七年的合同後、他就會覺得電話只會給他不幸、甚至於情願不用電話哩、</p>

<p>派拉蒙新片Prisonin　Hiding　、係根據華盛頓偵探聯合局長愛特哥胡佛新作改編、於是此偵探局長的G．Man型著作第一次搬上銀幕了、</p>
<p>凡着過『漁船血戰』的、總注意到飾桃樂姍拉摩喬治賴甫德朋友的史列克那隻海狗吧</p>
<p>「金山漁歌」中　史列克亦佔要角　不料在舊金山海濱拍攝的時候　史列克竟效甘地　絕食起來　這樣　來　急壞了他的主人温司登先生　轉而想到拍「北海漁光」時　他愛吃　的情形、就急忙拍電報給哥倫比亞河岸的魚行　用飛機運新鮮　魚來　於是史列克才歡天喜地拍戲、</p>
<p>『風流女鬼』康絲登斐納的一生事蹟可分爲三部、電影、製造化粧品、管理家庭、她能演片外據說她所用的化粧品、多半她自亡製造的、在荷姆拜山HolmupHill的事無大小、她又總喜歡親自出馬　况且辦得井井有條、</p>

<p>「從維也納大學、到這奧末黑的愛都闌都」哈立吹了聲口哨、「這一下子跳得不算不利害啦、」</p>
<p>『范先生、這是我全部的生活、』她肅然的說道、『今天、在高山的巓上、明天、也許就到了死海、』</p>
<p>『好、我猜你是很有道理的、小寳貝、但是、你還沒有說明白、你爲甚麽想部去帮秀莉卡的忙、』</p>
<p>『我那樣做、只是因爲、因爲我偶然對於你發生了一點興趣、我……我想你有一副超羣出衆的頭腦、』</p>
<p>哈立、已經很敏捷的、避開了她的視綫、將衣服換好、聽她說了這樣的話、好奇的瞥了她一眼、「如此說來、你卻觀察到了、是嗎、」</p>
<p>『是的』她一本正經的點着頭、『我、也有一副超羣出衆的頭腦、』</p>
<p>『幷且、還是超羣出衆的會說話、』哈在、椰揄地說、「因爲、一個女孩子、把她一生的動盪盡掛在牙齒上的、」</p>
<p>『我生來就是個刺激的追求者、』她若有所思似的。『我已經經過了許多的驚奇、危險、在我的死耗之前、我還要遇着更多這樣的事呢、』</p>
<p>『這樣說來、你都準備好了』、哈立搖若頭、『好了、你打算過吃晚飯麽』、</p>

<h3>南南海軍爭標戰　改於廿二日舉行　旭和杯第三戰俟埠際隊征菲返港後方舉行　乙組聯賽亞軍定明日在九龍會場舉行決戰</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）一九三八至三九年度之足球季、行將結束、六大錦標所餘未解决者、尙有甲組聯賽及旭和杯賽兩項、</p>
<p>聯賽最後一役、爲南華南對海軍、適該兩隊所得績分　高於一切、又相差僅一點、因是之故、此最後一役、等於决賽、</p>
<p>會爲趕早結束起見、原訂定該場比賽、於去星明六日在海軍場舉行、惟該日大雨如注、球場積水成窪、不能作比賽之用、乃宣吿改期、</p>
<p>昨日下午五時許、總會管理小組委員舉行會議、對南南與海軍之補賽日期、提出討論、乃議决於本月廿二日（星期六）下午四時半在海軍場舉行、</p>
<p>旭和杯第三戰、爲南華對海軍、本定廿二日舉行、惟南南與海軍旣改在該日作聯賽爭標戰、則旭和杯賽不得不爲之延期、　埠際隊征菲返港後方舉行、惟日期未定、大約在月初旬、</p>
<p>甲組聯賽、冠軍隊對征菲埠際隊之表演賽、定於廿三日（星期日）下午四時半在加路連山南華場舉行、如南南獲得冠軍、則其球員之被選爲埠際代表者、仍然爲南南効力、同日下午三時、增多一場乙組聯賽冠軍南華隊對聯隊表演賽、地點同上、俟下場賽畢、即行頒獎禮</p>
<p>旭和杯賽乃南華、海軍、降軍三會所合辦、故第三戰可押候五月初旬舉行、而於總會所訂結束日期無所抵觸、</p>
<p>乙組聯賽亞軍、尙未解决、蓋因米杜息與五營　兵績分相等、須行决賽、方定　屬、聞經决定明日（星期三）下午四時、在九龍會場舉行、</p>
<p>埠際隊將來赴菲　騁、總會曾應菲方之請、遺派裁判員奧馬隨隊前往、查奧馬本人亦以事赴菲、將於本星期四日先行動程云、（球場太歲）</p>
<h3>昨夕籃球賽星島挫華華　南華兄弟均勝警察</h3>
<p>公開男子籃球賽、昨晚甲　華南戰　島、兩隊爲本屆中之勁旅、對于　軍寶座、雄心勃勃、故値此决勝關頭、均以粗銳之師臨陣、戰事劇烈、爲開賽以來所未有、星島人壯馬强、復採取車輪式戰略、華南苦戰之餘、迭　所破、遂以廿一比卅五見敗、</p>
<p>星島戴福成、運用自如、迭建奇　、潘堯君籃下偷襲、巧妙絕倫、梁國　英勇可嘉、李沛炎、黎士傑均能策應前後、惟鍾志强嫌取略進　緩、未見佳作、</p>
<p>華南黃　德雖勇、時被星島嚴密監視、孤掌難鳴、陳贊恩、　贊富屢進而屢退李校、鍾靈雖能呼應週到、無奈星島守攻均一致、故其應付之下、終難免一敗、迨後黃佐德四罰離場、更陷于焚歌四面中、總觀華南之敗、氣力不　、亦一原因也、</p>

<h3>特殊情形下　海關行政破壞　實施事實有困難者據理呈復　出口稅率悉照政府規定辦理</h3>
<p>（上海通訊）淪陷後之上海江海關、稅務司羅福德迫於環境、在此特殊情形之下、將進口稅率更改、至於出口免稅超過徽稅、實係政府獎　國貨免稅出口之故、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>滬關免稅超過征稅</p>
<p>江海關二十七年八月出口徵稅六·三〇〇·六二〇元、免稅一四·八九四、二六三元、九月徵稅九·四七四。七七一元、免稅一八、一四五·九八五元、十月徵稅八·二四一·五九八元、免稅一四·六六〇·三〇九元、十一月徵稅一〇·〇二六·六〇〇元、免稅二〇·一九三、八一三元、十二月徵稅一〇·四三五·一一五元、免稅一七、五一四·三九九元·二十八年一月徵稅一一、三八四·二四一元、免稅一九·四二二·一八四元、二月徵稅一〇·五三一、〇四八元、免稅一八·六四一·五三六元、</p>
<p>特殊情形之下措施</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向海關方面探悉、上海之　海關、自國軍退出上海之後、稅收被截留、改有日商正金銀行、增加日籍關員、被迫易幟、減低進口稅率、名義上雖爲中國之海關、隸屬於總稅務司管轄之下、實際上海關行政、已爲破壞、關於土貨出口、應結外匯、及查禁資日物品、總稅務司梅樂和奉財政部令後、曾飭　海關遵辦、因羅稅務司認爲事實上有困難、當呈復不能遵辦經過、聞已得總務司之諒解</p>
<p>獎勵國貨免稅出口</p>
<p>我國各地　關之出口貨　價値、徵稅均較免稅爲多、惟上海之　海關相反、外界頗多不明眞相、但其實江海關之出口稅、戰後並未更改、悉照政府規定之稅率辨理、因上海向爲全國工商業之中心、國貨攤製工廠林立、目爲土貨集中出口之處、今政府　獎勵機製國貨及主要土貨之輸出、均命令准予免稅掛口、所以江海關之出口貨、免稅超過徵稅、其中免稅貨物、什之七八、爲機製國產貨物、</p>
<h3>閩省戰時通貨狀況　國省銀行紙幣的通流數量</h3>
<p>（永安通訊）閩省與海外關通固早、但商業迄未　現代化、貨幣大部窖藏、現金流轉之速率、遠不及西洋各國、卽與江浙諸省比較、亦復不如、因之通貨流通的數量、究有多少、難作精確之調查、但自二十四年十一月中央通令實施新幣制以來、由於該省當局的努力推行、紙幣流通數量、爲之大增、二十五年一月後、閩省各銀行紙幣發行額、亦見激增　、僅以中央銀行而論、每月卽常在一千二百萬左右、打破福建省紙幣發行的最高紀錄、</p>
<p>二十六年八月、滬戰爆發、全國陷入戰時狀態、閩省市面通貨需求、異常殷切、中央銀行每月的發行額、曾一度超過一千三百萬、雖然不久卽趨平穩、但亦足表示閩省戰時商業狀况、與夫法幣信用在民間之鞏固、除中央外、尙有中國、交通、中農、三行、因爲政府指定之國家銀行、其發行額自二十四年七月以來、均有增加、截至去年八月止、中國已由七四一·〇〇〇元增至五三·〇八三·〇〇〇元、交通已由三〇九·〇〇〇元增全二·四八七·〇〇〇元、中農則由二二二·〇〇〇無增至二·七四三·〇〇〇元、此四國家銀行中、紙幣發行額數、首推中央、次爲中國、三爲中農、四爲交通、中國實業銀行、自新幣制實施後、因非政府指定之國家銀行、流通市面之鈔票、逐漸收囘、至廿六年三月、全省僅有三萬三千元、然自抗戰軍興後、市場通貨缺乏、一時權宜、仍准發行鈔票、該行發行額又增至六三·〇〇〇元、但與前相比、則不及三分之一、此五行之鈔票、票面額除中央、中農二行間有輔幣券外、其最低者爲一元、便利於大宗留易之父割、小額買賣、則深感不便、此種缺點、有待於地方銀行之補救、（未完）</p>
<h3>英國體育稅年達百萬金鎊</h3>
<p>【倫敦通訊】英國國庫一年由運動中所得到的稅收、竟達一百萬鎊、如果一個球員由這會轉讓　那個會、那國庫裏就又多一筆進項、就這樣在運動的娛樂稅每年就有一百萬鎊。</p>
<p>就拿道囘　斯來說吧、他由狼隊轉到亞生諾、轉　費是一萬四千鎊、但狼隊是個興盛的會、不論他賣不賣鍾斯他都是　錢、他賣了鍾斯、多得一萬四千錄的利益、而且雖是這樣的、可是骨子妻、狼隊並有得到一萬四千鎊的好處、在這一萬多鎊中、每鎊僅拿到十四先令六便士而已、那就是說這一萬四千鎊中、有四千鎊是到了抽稅員的保險箱裏去了、</p>
<p>不過奇怪的、雖然國庫從　隊鍾斯的轉讓中、獲得四千鎊、但造有時在一個奮鬥中的丙組隊、出賣一個比鍾斯還好的一萬五千磅的球員時、他就計得不到一個銅錢、因爲一個賠錢的球會的買賣、是不能抽稅的、這樣他們賣一個一萬鎊的球昌他們就實收一萬鎊、但是一個球會也不能把他的這季賺的錢、全放在改良會場上、而報吿說是錢都用了、沒有賺錢、因爲只有保持現狀的花費、才算是合法的、加果你把利錢放在改善會場上、那抽稅員就會不承認你沒有賺錢、這時你賣球員的所得稅、終歸還得從腰包中人賺出來</p>
<p>所以你一定不明白他們到底是怎麽一囘事、狼隊以六千、七千、八千鎊、或隨便什麽數目賣一個球員、但是所得還不到四分之三、但同時又有一個小球會以六千鎊賣一個球員、而竟一文不少的放進口袋中、</p>
<p>所以、如果狼隊以一萬鎊買來一個球員、他所得到的、不過只値七千二百五十鎊（如果他賣的時候、只能得到　數目）、但如果一個丙組的小會以五千鎊買一個球員、這就實實在在的得到五千鎊的「貨品」、</p>
<p>至於娛樂稅的一百萬鎊中、有一半（四十五萬鎊）是從足球上獲得的、（足球、英式檻欖球、檻欖球聯賽）、此外計板球上約二萬、賽馬二十五萬磅、其他如賽車、跑狗等二十七萬磅、網球、拳擊、體操、冰球、等等約十萬磅、</p>
<p>在足球總會盃決賽之二萬四千鎊收入中、差不多有五千磅是為奴樂稅、</p>
<h3>東方南征足球隊大破西項Ｂ聯隊　各員多受傷仍勝七比二</h3>

<h3>歐局緊張影響本港股份市</h3>
<p>昨日本港之股份市、各買家均以歐洲戰雲密佈之關係、故頗多　躇、不敢吸收、是以成交亦極少、各買家現均候今　倫敦股份市之如何發展而定、故現多觀望態度、茲將昨日之成盆及買賣分錄如下、</p>

<h3>孩子的啓示</h3>
<p>— 祖德</p>
<p>兒童節，買了兩件玩具——一挺機關槍，一架坦克車，送給兩個小朋友。誰知兩個都爭着要槍還要車。我說打戰是分工合作各司其職的，放槍的不開車，開車的不放槍，但是，出乎意外地，們說：『把槍放在車上，這隻手開車，那隻手放槍·轟隆隆　——　是把××一齊打完了麽』—我沒的說，祗得又買了一套送他們。</p>
<p>現代的孩子眞眞是聰明得多了。不管那槍在車上是否合理干戰鬥，然而　們不因循舊轍，不爲你的言語所欺騙，富有創造性，這已是廿世紀孩子們的新跡，値得我們去注意。而他們不硬向人索取，運用他的思想和言語，說出來使你贊揚或是佩服而愛他，不得不買來送給他，這又是多麽精練的手段。他們也不過六七歲，居然有如此的表現，這是現代小學敎育所造成的良果。比起我們幼小時候讀『人手足刀尺』課本的效果要高明得多；而比那讀『三字經百家姓』的眞有天壤之別了。我根信一二十年後我們國家一定不會有因循懶惰的庸夫，受騙而不思索仍去蠻幹的傢伙出來，去作社會的蠹虫，甘爲國族的罪人。</p>
<p>一天，他倆正在洋台上『衝鋒陷陣』的時候。忽然，一個哭了，很傷心的哭；一個很爽直的說：「我賠你的，我賠你的！」原來是一個孩子把另一個孩子的軍跌壞了。</p>
<p>爲什麽哭得這麼傷心？一架車値不上一塊錢。想一想：他是從未想到錢的問題的，他祗　得他心愛的玩具有了損失，引起他的悲傷。因爲地的純潔心靈中早已深刻的印上了一些痕跡——槍和車，或者說他們小小的靈魂已一部分貫注到他心愛的玩具上面了，他怎麽不傷心？是以一個小孩的成長趨向于何種型式，全靠他所處的環境與所接觸的事物，來剌激而反應的表現出來。所以利用這『赤子之心』而造成的基礎，是很難受外力的影響。報載廈門旭贏院的兒童，在兒童節時大書打倒××，還我河山等，是很好的一個證據。想起「幼稚敎育和小學敎育是國家的命脉」，『國家的責任在小學敎師身上』一些名言，不能無所警惕吧！</p>
<p>再，那一個孩子是很坦率的，把別人的玩具跌壞了，只有倍！而不扯謊，不忘却他的責任，「一人作事一人當」，不「含沙射影」，的嫁禍旁人，這態度的嚴正，比起那些明明自己作錯而不認錯，反之倒行逆施，一意孤行的强得多。但這般帶假面具的人世上就多得很，上自達官顯人下至販夫走卒，虛張聲勢，一唱數和的，今天來一篇「××論」，明天又「舉一個例」，這種行爲，眞是比不上小孩子，卽孩子們所唱的「我爲中國生我爲中國死」的語詞，他們多曲解或竟是不懂。雖然他們多吃了幾十年墨缸水也不成，于從我說：「他們要學　的核子們！」想起那有志不在年高，無知空長百歲」的兩句俗語，不禁要拍案叫絕！</p>
<h3>月夜到徐州</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>——徐州突圍回憧記</p>
<p>佟村是一個約有四五十一人家的相當大的村莊，寬敞的大瓦房，比高粱蓋的茅草房來得多，這井在北方很少見到的一種希有的現象。這裏離徐州約有三十多里路，但不知爲甚麼老百姓已逃走完了，每間屋內都是那末空洞洞的，家具隨便亂擺着，失了主人，不知已餓了多少日子的瘦狗，胆怯的蜷屈在屋角裏睡着，見到了陌生的人也不乾再跳起來嗥叫。</p>
<p>在魯南時，就遣派囘去的幾個戰地服務團的女同志，因爲隴海路被截斷，又回到隊伍裏來了，聽說徐州已非常危急，一個老百姓也沒有了。但大家仍希望快到徐州去，去保衛那軍事重鎭，阻碍那×人想打通津浦鐵路的徐州！</p>
<p>×機整天在天空裏盤旋着，人馬便一切悶在屋裏，讓它多消耗一些汽油，不去理它。</p>
<p>下午七時，分拿着一個迫擊砲彈，在黑暗中沿公路又向前出發了，黃灰　騰騰的飛揚着，人身上被黃灰糊得那末黃黃的，鼻孔裏塞滿了一團污泥，人不住的被弄得咳着嗽。……</p>
<p>被公路分爲兩半的一個小村莊，給×機炸毀完了，一間茅草房給燒夷彈燒光了，只剩下兩堵被火烘紅了的士　。在瓦　場中屹立着，人給埋在瓦礫下發臭。</p>
<p>好似見到了什麽鬼似的，臭到了那役難聞的臭氣，人忍不住向前跑了。</p>
<p>月亮慢慢的從昏暗的原野那邊爬起來了，樹，村莊也從黑暗中透露出來了。月亮的淸暉，慘白的瀉在那熟睡着的麥子上，那麥子一動也不動的在享受着月光的這温存。</p>
<p>因爲等着發灰麵，弟兄們便一長串的停止在公路上，豫備在西店領得了灰麵，隊伍才慢慢的繼續前進。</p>
<p>因爲等不得發灰麵，我們掮着迫擊砲彈，不要灰麵的便定了。在明亮的月光下，在那黃灰厚厚的公路上，走了兩點多鐘，經過了幾隻突出着的小山，到了徐州了</p>
<p>這已不是一個月前我們經過時的徐州，那時徐州是熱悶的，繁華的，現在的徐州已死去了，街上兩旁的房子像害了什麽傳染病似的，一切倒平了，瓦礫壓在燒焦了的椽子上，沒有屋頂的墻，像在埋怨×人的殘暴似的，直挺挺的轟立着。街上沒有一個人，粗暴的腳步聲也引不起喪家之狗的嗥叫，滿目是片妻凉恐怖，就像走到了什麽死城裏。</p>
<p>忽然，一輛載滿了灰麵的汽車，從前面跑了過來，我們忙把她叫住，要了十袋洋灰麵。可是大家看看沒辦法帶走，便將洋灰麵和迫擊砲彈，堆在路旁的一輛破馬車上，七八個人挽着推着走。費不少的力，推到南門外了，再也無法推走了、只好將那十袋洋灰麵藏在路旁的一間小草房裏，扛着迫擊砲彈。在一陣緊急的槍　聲中，趕忙追上前面的隊伍。</p>
<p>噠噠噠……關槍淸澈的響着，砲聲嗡嚨嗡嚨的也在響，空氣緊張得像要炸破了，人馬迅速的只是前進。</p>
<p>流着汗，吃力的肩着那顆沉重的迫擊砲彈，跟在隊伍的後面走着，雖然心裏有些警異的，×人已打到徐州城外來了，但我沒想到這是徐州的最後一天，第二天（五月十九日）×人就會進徐州。</p>
<p>我們默默的走着，當天　出了朦朧的曙光時，一隻×機從後面飛來，隊伍忙散開到麥田裏。不見了。×機飛遠了，人馬又匯合成一條鐵流，洶湧的向前流着。</p>
<h3>「小鬼」在西北　他們擔任掌號送信　伙夫雜差等項工作</h3>
<p>兩萬以上無家可歸的中國流亡兒童，來自中國各地，在西北加入了笫八路軍，對日作戰。這些孩子的年齡，大半在十一歸以上，十六歲以下，所以拿軍器還嫌太小，可是他們會擔任掌號，送信，伙夫，演劇，雜差等工作。一般的人都把這些孩子稱做「小鬼」。在每一個軍營裏，他們最是快樂，他們穿着雜色的棄去的軍服，時常會弄成三式，而獲得的糧餉，和正規軍隊一樣每月件幣一元。一個被太陽晒黑了面孔的孩子對人說，做一個「小鬼」，比在日本佔領區內做一個田野裏的餓鬼有趣得多，他十二歲就離家鄉，加入朱德將軍統率的的軍隊，現在這　孩子已被一般的人認爲非常重要，因爲在弟八路軍的總司令部，祗有他是准許守崗。這些孩子裏面，受過敎　的不多，可是加入了第八路軍，每天早上要受識宇敎育的。</p>
<p>他們以耐得勞苦著聞，一個十四歲的孩子，跟在一隊騎在馬上的軍官後面，有過一天，走了四十三英里路。到了晚上九點鐘，營是紮好了，他還是像松鼠一樣，支呷支哩的在替軍官預備床舖。</p>
<p>這些孩子，到了晚上，每是坐在一起，很誠摯的討論白天打敎師那邊聽得來的關於軍事學或政事科學上的各個問題。</p>
<p>在每一個軍營裏，「小鬼」有他們自己的軍事組織，並選舉他們自己的長官。他們官誓遵守的一種榮譽的法紀，是和美國的童子軍相仿的。</p>
<p>幾百個孩子，在內戰時老早就加入紅軍的，現在都是笫八路軍中的長官了。</p>
<p>「小鬼」經過了軍事訓練之後，在戰鬥力的裏面，是最足信任的一種質素。爲了這原因，指揮軍事的畏官，每是在他們的裏面，選出自己的衛隊的。</p>
<p>除了「小鬼」之外，第八路軍裏面，還有幾千中國靑年，男都有，由全國各地的中等學校和專科學校中徵募得來。現在，他們在中國防綫的後面，擔任各種救濟工作在戰地上面，自前綫到後方，設有幾百個服務站。這些靑年；都是三民主義靑年團的團員。服務站的裏，有藥設備，圖書，雜誌，廚房，鍋竈，用具，少數米糧和開水。在服務站十工作的靑年，有好多自己承認，他們爲了要對戰事盡些責任，才背了人打家裏　出來的。（下略）—卡蒙譯自密勒氏評論報—</p>
<h3>抗戰與詩歌</h3>
<p>— 序亭</p>
<p>爲什麼　國時代以後的詩歌，會在文壇特殊的發達呢？也許爲了天下大亂，文士作家都戎馬疆場，或是顚沛流離的緣故，再也沒有大功夫埋頭書　來作幾篇較長的文字。然而，雖在那混亂的時代，人的感情永不失去，更反特殊的增長，更充滿了悲壯慷慨的熱情和纏綿悽惻的哀情。於是這短小而極表感情的詩歌便大大的被利用，被發展了。</p>
<p>現在，全國抗戰：大時代被開展了。文壇正鬧着「爲什麼還沒有偉大的作品呢」的問題：我倒不以爲然，我以爲，這該是偉大詩歌創作　時代。</p>
<p>據某副刊的編輯說：凡文藝刊物收到的稿件，詩歌占極大的數目，也就是這個道理；但是，每一份刊物（當然除了詩歌刊物）都束於詩歌占全稿八份之一的方式，作家也因了加以拘束，詩歌便無法擴展了。這也就是現代的詩歌不似三國那時發達的原因。</p>
<p>我們知道，詩歌並不比其他文藝來得更壞；反比其他寫作便利，更有感情的力量。在我國作家，現在自然像三國時代的文士一機，戎馬疆　或顚沛流離，卽使暫時坐定，也困于用論文的格式，向×人，漢奸以及一切腐收份子作猛烈的攻擊，或是正通　地向大衆解釋抗戰的意義。所以，雖則有着良好的題材，但沒有餘暇的時間，從事偉大文藝的創作。然而詩歌的創作，依然沒有妨碍，短小的　裁却富於感情的表現，假使這些刊物能打破八一的方式，詩歌無疑地會飛躍進展的。</p>
<p>歌詠大時代的偉績，就在這時吧！</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>——前者，是對她的，後者，是對他的；二者之間，雖是同樣的歡迎，有着同樣的誠意，但在宇句上，聲調中，却不相稱而相反。因此，她對於那些祖國命運的寄托者，看做仇視的一三了。他們這些像富家一樣的青年，就是艱苦鬥爭的義勇軍嗎？她所保留的義勇軍貧困得感人的照片，就是他們欺騙的縮影嗎？她曾給義舅軍的捐欵，就是給了他們這些豪富的浪字嗎？她錯誤的想像，想到無限遠去。她想向他們喊叫：</p>
<p>『你們這些騙子，我被騙得太久了』！因爲她不知道他們的美好的服裝，是租賃的，暫借的，是虛偽的外形。她那簡單的心和眼睛，不曾　試過複雜的世界。</p>
<p>那些被她誤認爲富有的靑年，浪子，騙子的陌生者，圍起雨文來，握住他的手脚，高舉起來，然後，在空間擺搖着他，表示對於他的感激和工作成功的慶祝。他在他們近於瘋狂的擺搖中，帽子落了，被踏得失形，衣扣開了，露出的破的襯衣：他彷彿是兒童的玩物——被玩弄到最高的時候，幾乎有被損失壞的可能。他們的笑聲，鞋子打着地板的響聲，合成一流，使人分辨不淸，這時候，這世界，彷彿祗有這一種分辨不淸的聲昔，他們搖擺着，在屋內打着旋轉，由屋角轉至另一屋角，由屋角又轉至屋的中間，這屋地，已經不够他們活動的地區；僅有簡單的桌椅，被擁擠得找不到適當的地方而有一剎那安定的停放，好像有感覺似地隨着他們一樣跳動。他們的這狂歡，彷彿就是古老的祖國的片刻的快樂。</p>
<p>在這次狂歡中，唯有她一人冷落，被冷落在監視之下，如同一個被厭棄的孤女，無人理睬。於是，她用拳頭打着自己的胸脯，跳起脚來；這樣，她們似乎可以舒展一下悶塞的氣息。</p>
<p>雨文看見的時候，他知道了——他曾把她忘於自己的狂歡以外，加重了她的煩燥和惡感。於是，他立刻從同志的，手中掙脫下來。她跑過去，撲着他，想抱住他——她現在唯一的相識看，想像中的唯一的保護人。她禁不住向他傾吐着怨言：</p>
<p>『我要是知道你把我帶到這樣可怕的地方，我寧願死在街上！』</p>
<p>他更把她扯得靠近些，用手指輕輕地貼撫着她的肩膀，望她微微地一笑，好像哄着一個孩子的表示。</p>
<p>『你看，誰敢欺負你！』隨着，他便向所有的同志說：</p>
<p>『從現在開始，誰都不要惹這位朱琳小姐生氣，然當把她看做我們自己的小妹妹！』他又轉向她說：『如果他們有人難爲你，你吿訴我，我負責？』（四十）</p>

        <h1>1939.04.18</h1>
<h3>The Great Significance of President Roosevelt's Peace Plan</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt of the United States, who has repeatedly condemned global aggressors and advocated for collective sanctions, once again adopted an extremely courageous and sincere attitude on the 15th, sending a telegram to Hitler and Mussolini, proposing a peace plan. Its content roughly includes three key points: first, exposing that aggressors repeatedly advocate for peace while in fact repeatedly annexing other people's countries; second, clarifying that the attitude and intention of the United States lies in compassion for the world's humanity, rather than weakness, timidity, or fear of war; third, specifically proposing a joint guarantee of the security of 31 countries worldwide. In today's era when the aggressive nations of Germany, Italy, and Japan are strengthening their policies of gradual encroachment and annexation, President Roosevelt's peace plan carries extremely significant meaning.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the escalating actions of Germany and Italy, Britain and France have also become more proactive in convening an anti-aggression coalition. Judging from the general situation, the formation of a global anti-aggression alliance is gradually becoming concrete. Not only have the small countries of Eastern Europe gradually come under the leadership of Britain and France, but military cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has also shown a positive trend. Britain is eager for the Soviet Union to participate in the "Anti-Hitler Alliance," preparing to establish an air defense agreement with the Soviet Union, and France is also negotiating a new agreement with the Soviet Union to enable the Soviet Union to provide automatic assistance. At this time, the attitude and policies of the United States play a very significant role in the organization of this anti-aggression alliance. The trend of events may lead to the European anti-Hitler movement concretely transforming into a global anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? Isn't President Roosevelt's proposal a plan for global peace? President Roosevelt's peace plan will absolutely not gain the approval of Hitler, Mussolini, or even the aggressor Japan in the East. Although Hitler, Mussolini, and others are still studying it carefully after President Roosevelt's peace plan was issued, German and Italian newspapers have almost unanimously criticized it maliciously. A Berlin dispatch on the 17th even stated: "Hitler, after discussing with Ribbentrop and Mussolini, immediately decided to reject President Roosevelt's proposal." The German side has further expanded the propaganda of the so-called "London terror against Germans."</p>
<p>The likely effect of President Roosevelt's peace plan is to more concretely and rapidly facilitate the successful conclusion of an anti-aggression alliance among peaceful nations. The greatest reaction to the peace plan is the response from the countries most actively opposed to aggression. Soviet newspapers unanimously and enthusiastically welcomed the peace plan. Political circles regarded President Roosevelt's proposal as a practical and effective step in maintaining world peace. The Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, Kalinin, even sent a special telegram to President Roosevelt expressing his congratulations. Secondly, public opinion and political circles in anti-aggression countries such as Britain and France also welcomed President Roosevelt's proposal with extremely excited attitudes and tones.</p>
<p>This peace plan of President Roosevelt targets aggressors, including those in the East, making the anti-aggression alliance global, rather than limited to Europe. The peace proposal mentioned that the Japanese aggressors' occupation of China was an oversight. We hope that the United States, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining peace in the Pacific, will have another opportunity to reiterate this point. At the same time, the conclusion of the future global anti-aggression alliance must include the East, making it a complete "system of collective security." Currently, the actions of the aggressive countries have very clearly become closely linked, and they echo each other in the East and West. Regardless of whether some within the Eastern aggressor themselves do not approve of hastily joining the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the collusion and conspiracy of the three aggressive countries are undeniable facts.</p>
<p>China has recently launched large-scale counter-offensives on various battlefields in the North and South and has been winning victories steadily. This should have extremely significant meaning for the concrete formation of a global anti-aggression front that includes the East. Any proposal for a global anti-aggression plan should not forget that China is one of its pillars.</p>
<h3>China's Economic Diplomacy During Wartime</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiaomei</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Xiaomei is a well-known economist both in China and abroad. He has served as the director of the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China and has also presided over the National Institute of National Economy of China. It is said that Dr. Zhang has also been appointed as the Deputy Director of the National Southwestern Economic Research Institute, which is currently being prepared for establishment.</p>
<p>(1) The Key to Success or Failure in Modern Warfare</p>
<p>During the World War in 1914, Germany stood alone against all sides, fighting for four years, and ultimately failed: not because of setbacks on the front lines, but because of the inadequacy of the rear. Based on his experience in the Great War, the famous general Ludendorff advocated the theory of total war, believing that in modern warfare, there is no distinction between the front and the rear; the outcome is determined not by the quantity of military equipment, but by the strength of the nation's resources. This no longer limits itself to the clash between the two sides' armies, but becomes a struggle between two major nations.</p>
<p>The ancient saying "victory and defeat are common occurrences for military strategists" is especially true today. After all, temporary gains and losses are hardly sufficient to determine the key to victory. The duration of the war, leading to final victory, truly depends on the resilience of the entire nation, the consolidation of the entire national economy; especially the latter as a prerequisite for long-term war resistance in terms of materials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, modern international relations are intricate and complex; disputes between two countries are often sufficient to initiate conflicts of interest for related third countries and even the entire world. China, which is known as a semi-colony, has always been a battlefield for the great powers to compete. Japan's war against China is undoubtedly aimed at excluding European powers from the Far East, blockading China's door, so that it can enjoy it alone. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident, the Sino-Japanese dispute has long become a major performance on the international political stage. Since the July 7th Incident developed into the August 13th Battle, although the great powers have not performed actively due to various reasons, their sympathy and assistance to China in spirit and material have already been of considerable use. Especially today, after Japan's ambition to swallow China alone has gradually been seen through by the world, it can no longer sit idly by. For example, Britain and the United States have successively issued tough diplomatic notes to Japan and resolutely moved from spiritual sympathy for China to material assistance. Our country is fighting for independent survival and has national resources hundreds of times greater than Japan's as its backing. Whether or not we can obtain foreign resources is not enough to sway our determination to resist the war and our strength to win. However, being able to obtain foreign resources during wartime can indeed make our war resistance strength more substantial. Moreover, our country's industry is backward, and the modern military industry has no foundation to speak of. Therefore, striving for overseas resources is also an indispensable procedure for the great cause of war resistance. The European War ended with the participation of the United States. On the surface, it was because the Allied Powers had the addition of this new force that they were able to defeat the exhausted German army. In essence, it was due to Germany's scarce resources, which made it even more impossible to use overseas resources to make up for them, leading to its rapid collapse.</p>
<p>Our government, in view of this, ordered the stabilization of finances at the beginning of the war, on the one hand, engaged in the relocation of industries inland, promoted industrial cooperative movements, and built the Southwest; enlightened resources and rectified the domestic economy. On the other hand, it maintained creditworthiness, recognized the principle of open doors, expressed welcome to foreign investment, and strived for economic cooperation with friendly countries. Now, after one and a half years of the war, the currency system is stable, the economy is stable, and the consensus of opinions of various countries is praiseworthy.</p>
<p>(2) The International Development of Resisting Aggression</p>
<p>Resisting aggression is based on our resolute resistance to the war, leading to the final victory. If friends from friendly countries can take economic sanctions against the aggressors in accordance with the principles of justice and humanity, then the effort will be twice the result with half the work, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, at the beginning of March, the Chinese delegation in Brussels published the economic conditions for resisting Japan's aggression against China as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Prohibit the supply of military or industrial raw materials to Japan, because Japan's military and industrial raw materials are mostly supplied from abroad; if countries stop supplying, even if limited to a small number of major items, it will inevitably give it a serious blow.</p>
<p>(2) Boycott Japanese goods and Japanese ships. Japan's international balance of payments relies on the export of industrial products and its shipping income to balance it; if countries boycott Japanese goods and Japanese ships, it will not only put its industry to death, but also destroy its entire national economy.</p>
<p>(3) Refuse to extend credit to Japan. Japan's war expenses are huge, and its domestic resources are limited. Without foreign credit, it will not be able to take care of itself, let alone develop the gains of aggression; if countries refuse credit, it will not only make it impossible for it to profit from the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, but it can also strengthen the effectiveness of points one and two.</p>
<p>(4) The economic measures of a considerable number of countries. Because the supply of Japan's raw materials and credit and the market for its exports are concentrated in a small number of countries, these few countries, including the United States, the British Empire, France, and the Andu, Holland, and East India, Belgium, etc., if they break off economic relations with Japan, then Japan will be like a fish out of water and cannot be active.</p>
<p>(5) Assist China, so as to strengthen China's ability to resist the war and resist international aggressive forces, then all peace-loving countries should expand their assistance to China and broadly conduct military and financial assistance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in early February 1938, the International Executive Committee passed a resolution to aid China, reiterating the resolution of the previous conference: requesting countries to do their best to aid China. At the same time, the international peace movement convened an international boycott conference in London, attended by representatives from twenty countries, who unanimously passed the boycott resolution: severely punishing aggressive behavior. Later, a conference of the international peace movement was convened in Paris, unanimously opposing Japan's indiscriminate killing of innocent people, resolving to boycott Japanese goods, stop the supply of military supplies, encourage loans to China, and resolving to designate the China Aid General Association in London as the central hub of the international China aid movement; from October of the same year, the association also issued an international China aid newsletter once a month to communicate and promote the development of China aid work in various places. Currently, the international China aid work supported by these international peace organizations is generally moving forward along the following three major lines: (1) urging governments of various countries to implement the resolutions of the League of Nations on sanctions against Japan? (2) Expanding the movement to boycott Japanese goods, (3) Donating money, donating medicines and clothing, and providing relief to Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees.</p>
<p>(3) The Achievements of Our Country's Economic Diplomacy</p>
<p>The aforementioned China aid work is all automatically carried out by fair-minded people around the world and is implemented in the form of civil groups, and cannot be regarded as the harvest of our country's economic diplomacy. What is promoted by our government and can be regarded as economic diplomatic work is the effort to win financial assistance from various countries to China. Among the various countries at present, the three major democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France are the most sympathetic to us and play a pivotal role. These are described separately below.</p>
<p>China and the United States are on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and have always been friendly. Since the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty at the Washington Conference, they have become even more cordial. When the September 18th Incident occurred, former Secretary of State Stimson strongly upheld justice and ran around to appeal, and the League of Nations ultimately passed the non-recognition resolution. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the people of the country looked up to the United States very much. Although there were isolationists and absolute pacifists in American public opinion, most of them condemned aggression and sympathized with resistance, especially those with a slightly longer-term vision, such as Mr. Stimson and Emory Lucck D. ochD, pastor of the Shanghai International Church, etc., all unanimously advocated the moral responsibility of the United States in the Sino-Japanese war, advocating for active behavior. The famous Far East commentator Nathaniel Pleffer, after observing the results of China's one-year war of resistance, also changed his original position of isolationism and advocated that the beauty should not cooperate with the aggressive country: "Don't buy (Japanese goods) don't sell (military supplies) don't borrow (credit)"; at the same time, cooperate with non-aggressive countries: give them various conveniences). From this, the American public opinion's sympathy for China can be seen.</p>
<p>The post-war Sino-American economic relations that deserve attention are the silver problem and the credit problem.</p>
<p>In 1934, the United States began its silver purchase policy, raising silver prices, and even to the point where China could not maintain the silver standard. In November 1935, it announced the suspension of the silver standard and adopted a managed exchange rate system. In the spring of 1936, our banker Mr. Chen Guangfu was entrusted to visit the United States and signed a silver agreement with U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, in which the United States purchased 50 million taels of Chinese silver at a value of 45 cents per tael.</p>
<p>In July 1937, the first Sino-American agreement expired. At that time, Minister of Finance Kong attended the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor and then visited the United States, and renewed the silver agreement, exchanging silver for gold, for our country's exchange reserves and export credit guarantees.</p>
<p>In July 1938, the agreement expired again; in the next sentence of this month, the Japanese side spread rumors, saying that Britain had plans to convert China's gold currency reserves into international co-management. The U.S. Treasury Secretary officially declared that the U.S. purchase of Chinese silver agreement had been extended; the conditions were largely the same as before.</p>
<p>According to the Citibank Monthly in August. In May 28, the Chinese government asked the U.S. government to continue purchasing silver to help stabilize Sino-American currency relations. The two sides immediately established a rollover agreement, agreeing to exchange Chinese silver for U.S. dollar credit or gold. In the first half of 1938, 140 million taels of Chinese silver were shipped to New York, worth 63 million U.S. dollars. Since October 1937. A total of 190 million taels of silver were shipped, worth 84 million U.S. dollars. Since 1934, the United States has purchased a total of 300 million taels of Chinese silver, and the proceeds from the sale were partially marked as gold and partially used as bank deposits. This is a glimpse of Sino-American monetary cooperation.</p>
<p>However, the destruction of war is infinite, so it is not enough to talk about long-term war resistance unless we strive for construction and enlighten resources, let alone post-war restoration, and it is necessary to utilize foreign credit.</p>
<p>In late September 1938, the Chinese delegation arrived in the United States, still led by banking magnate Mr. Chen Guangfu. On the one hand, they negotiated with the U.S. industry for the supply of military supplies and credit, and on the other hand, they discussed with the U.S. government for loans.</p>
<p>On October 20, the U.S. Treasury Department declared that the negotiations with the Chinese delegation had made progress.</p>
<p>On December 16, the Sino-American $25 million loan was announced, and at the same time, there was good news about the establishment of a Sino-British loan. This credit is for a period of five years and is purely commercial in nature, and most of it will be used to purchase trucks and gasoline.</p>
<p>Sino-British. Since the full-scale war of resistance was launched, our country's coastal ports have been threatened. Tianjin and Shanghai bore the brunt. The focus of foreign trade initially shifted to South China, relying on Hong Kong as its lip and teeth. However, the situation in Guangzhou was precarious and ultimately could not be guaranteed. Therefore, the government from the beginning was eagerly opening up another waterway, opening the "back door," so that foreign supplies and native products could still flow unimpeded.</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Burma Highway has long been under discussion, and the British side's intention to open up trade in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has also been brewing for a long time. However, it must wait for the promotion of the war of resistance before tens of thousands of people work day and night to complete the entire line in a few months and open it to traffic in July 1938. Therefore, Sino-British economic cooperation can take a further step.</p>
<p>Since the Yunnan-Burma Highway was opened to traffic, it has been widely rumored that Britain will borrow money to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway. As Japan openly overturned the Nine-Power Treaty and proposed the so-called East Asia New Order, clearly excluding the rights and interests of foreign merchants, Britain and the United States took joint action and had discussions on retaliation against Japan. The Yulin Times of London reported on December 6 that the Chinese government plans to build 1,000 miles of railway in western China and has ordered 850 steel plate cars from Leeds Company in England, and has also ordered 25 miles of rails for construction, ready to first connect Kunming Dali and then seek to expand.</p>
<p>On December 15, Havas News Agency in London confirmed that a Sino-British loan had been agreed in principle, allocating a loan of £10 million to the Chinese government for the construction of the railway from Xiaguan (near Dali in Yunnan) to the Yunnan-Burma border. The railway plan is entirely managed by British merchants and assisted by the Export Credit Guarantee Department. However, it is heard that the railway cost is only £6 million, and the remaining £4 million can be used to purchase other railway materials and heavy vehicles. In addition, it is rumored that last year's British credit to China was only £500,000, and the recently established Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund of £5 million is the first step in Britain's decision to help China with financial resources.</p>
<p>Although British and American loans are commercial in nature, they also have political implications. Therefore, the national public opinion unanimously welcomes them, such as summarizing them into five points: (1) At this time when the war of resistance has entered the second stage, foreign loans, regardless of size, can encourage the people and inspire morale; (1) Show British and American friendship; (3) Consolidate our determination to respect credit. (4) The political nature of which is quite noteworthy; (5) It is bound to arouse the opposition of the Japanese side, but we are increasingly convinced that we are strong enough to break the dreams of the invaders in Asian empires.</p>
<p>Sino-French. Sino-French relations have always been very good. According to the May-July issue of the Millard's Review, in the article "Southwest Welcomes Foreign Guests" (author Wong Hin), it is said that "a French silver company has established a loan with the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company. The railway management is entirely under the responsibility of the Sichuan-Guizhou Company. Only during the construction period, two French experts are hired to supervise the project. All village materials are purchased on the open market; the loan guarantee is guaranteed by the China Construction Bank (entirely operated by Chinese people) as the only guarantor. The debt revenue and expenditure matters are guaranteed by the Debt Committee organized by the railway company." According to the New York's famous Far Eastern magazine Far Eastern Survey of September 28, in the article on French rights and interests in China, it indicated that this loan is a total of 34.5 million yuan of Chinese national currency, of which 7 million yuan is paid in cash, and the remaining 27.5 million yuan is used to purchase materials.</p>
<p>The above loan method is purely a commercial investment and removes any additional conditions, which is a precedent for Sino-foreign economic cooperation. In the Southwest Railway plan, there is one from Guangxi Nanning to the Vietnamese border, which is of the greatest concern to French interests. Now that British and American loans have set the stage, France has responded.</p>
<p>In the midst of war destruction, we have still obtained the credit and assistance of the great powers, and the Japanese side's activities in the world have only received unanimous condemnation. This is because of the achievements of our country's wartime economic diplomacy. It is also because our country's war of resistance is a mission that any nation should have for independent survival; and it is an indispensable element for ensuring peace in East Asia and even world peace. Therefore, the cooperation of countries around the world with China's wartime economy should be progressing steadily.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of the New Provincial Capital of Xikang</h3>
<p>[Kangding Correspondence] The reporter has been traveling here for nearly two months. After several days of inspection in the provincial capital, I have a rough understanding of the local situation. Now, I will record what I have learned from the investigation as follows.</p>
<p>A Casual Talk About the Past. Kangding was formerly the land of the Sanwei, the Western Qiang during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the Maoniu Kingdom during the Han dynasty. In the sixth year of the Jianyuan era of Emperor Wu of Han, a county was established, under the jurisdiction of Qinghai. During Zhuge Liang's southern expedition in the Shu Han Dynasty, Guo Da was sent to Tong'an to appease the region. Da set up furnaces in the mountains of Kangding to make arrows. This is the origin of the name 打箭鑪 (Dajianlu, meaning "arrow-making furnace"). During the Jin Dynasty, it belonged to the Western Rong. During the Tang Dynasty, it was under the jurisdiction of Tubo, and the tea-horse trade became increasingly frequent. This continued from the Five Dynasties to the Song Dynasty. During the Yuan Dynasty, it belonged to the Xifan Changhexi Pacification Commissioner's Office and other offices. In the fifth year of the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty, the chieftain Awang Jiantai was awarded the title of Ming Zhengzhang for his follow-up expedition, and he was in charge of the two Tusi of Yutong and Yu. He was also the Pacification Commissioner of Ningyuan Military and Civilian Affairs, a hereditary post. In the thirty-ninth year of the Kangxi era of the Qing Dynasty, the Tusi Xila Zhakeba was killed by Tibetan officials Chang Ce Jilie and others. The Governor of Sichuan sent troops to quell the rebellion, and his son Shen Qin Tiande succeeded him. Later, Dajianlu Subprefecture was changed to Tongzhi Hall, under the jurisdiction of Yazhou Prefecture, and the Tusi under its jurisdiction. Ming Zheng was the most respected. In the thirty-first year of the Guangxu era, Feng Quan, the Deputy High Commissioner stationed in Tibet, was killed by Tibetan mobs in Batang due to his obstinacy and self-use. The Qing court appointed Zhao Erfeng as the Border Affairs Minister and led troops to quell the rebellion. After a year of conquest, in the thirty-fourth year of the Guangxu era, Dajianlu was changed to a directly subordinate hall, under the jurisdiction of Jianchang Circuit, and generally in charge of the six grain routes outside the pass. In the third year of the Xuantong era, the land of the three Tusi was changed to counties. In the early years of the Republic of China, Yin Changheng led his army on the Western Expedition and changed Dajianlu to Kangding Prefecture. A Pacification Office was established in the prefectural city, with various departments set up, and he served as the Pacification Commissioner, commanding the various armies and administering the various counties. In the second year of the Republic of China, because the Ministry of Internal Affairs standardized the national administrative regions, it was changed to Kangding County, and Anliang County was merged into it. In this year, the establishment of Xikang Province was realized, and it was immediately made the provincial capital. The provincial government was established here, and the county government remained the same. The Kangding Municipal Committee is now established. Xikang belongs to Sichuan and Yunnan internally, controls Tibet externally, connects Myanmar to the south, and connects Qinghai to the north. Since ancient times, it has been a key area in the western border. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Li, the Qing court believed that the situation in Tibet and Tibet was critical, with strong neighbors coveting it externally and border people rebelling internally. Therefore, Zhao Erfeng was specially appointed as the Sichuan-Yunnan Border Affairs Minister to actively manage and prepare for the establishment of a province. Zhao was able to obtain sufficient assistance from the central government and the assistance of neighboring provinces. He handled the reform of the entire border, and the military power made the barbarian tribes submit. Within a few years, more than thirty counties were established. At that time, Zhao was stationed in Ba'an, believing that the city had a mild climate, abundant products, and an important situation, no less than the southern border fence. He planned to set it as the capital, and all the planned provincial plans were centered on Ba'an. People from Sichuan Province and the British and French people who preached to Ba'an rose up in large numbers, and Ba'an had already taken the shape of a provincial capital. However, due to the overturning of the Qing court, the Tibetan bandits took the opportunity to commit crimes internally, and more than a dozen counties in Kangxi were successively lost. The people in charge of border affairs have been changed repeatedly, perfunctory and tolerant, and the situation has deteriorated. After the 24th Army Commander Liu Wenhui's troops took over the defense, they immediately recovered Dengke, Dege, Baiyu, and Shiqu counties by force, completing the ruling situation east of the Jinsha River. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the bandits have entered deeper and the territory has shrunk. Xikang is not only a barrier to the southwest, but also the center of international transportation. Kangding has always been the hub of Sichuan-Tibet transportation. Now, it is the provincial capital of Xikang, and the military and politics are both important, and it has formed an important town in the western border.</p>

<h3>Valiant Charity Worker - A Friend of China in China (9)</h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>On one hand, due to the convenience of the headquarters' car, and on the other hand, thanks to Section Chief Liang's introduction that there were several foreigners serving at the Hexi Hospital, Li Meng and his wife wanted to visit them. The hospital was located west of Qujiang in Shaoguan, so everyone called it "Hexi Hospital." But its real name was "Methodist Hospital." It was founded by the British Christian Church. The car crossed the wooden bridge over the Qujiang River, followed the riverside road, and after six or seven minutes, arrived at the hospital gate. It was surrounded by large trees, backed by mountains and facing water, with extremely beautiful scenery. Upon entering the hospital, all the facilities, equipment, and displays gave us an impression of cleanliness and order. On the walls hung many new-style plaques such as "Miraculous Hands Bring Back Spring" and "Hua Tuo Reborn"... The inscription next to the mirror indicated that they were gifts to Dr. Xia Dao-xi. Unexpectedly, this Xia Dao-xi, who was called "Hua Tuo Reborn," was the foreign doctor we wanted to see. His English name was Roy Horgetl. I became very interested in this "Foreign Hua Tuo." I really couldn't imagine what kind of person he was. After a while, Dr. Xia came. Like the other two people I had met today, the first thing I noticed was that he also had a small mustache under his nose. He wasn't a tall fellow, wearing a white doctor's uniform, holding a pipe in his hand, his face full of smiles, and his eyes constantly looking at us shrewdly. One look and you knew he was a very capable character. After introducing ourselves to each other, Mr. Xia Dao-xi invited us to sit on the porch in front of his room. The porch was covered with a thin carpet. The five of us sat on small rattan chairs around the table, on which were placed several English magazines and newspapers. I hadn't seen such things for a long time, and I couldn't help but be happy to see them again. Mr. Xia also took out two photo albums for us to look at. There were many images of enemy planes diving straight down from high altitude while bombing Shaoguan, and many tragic scenes after the bombing, including children with broken legs, and corpses of mothers and children lying together... Looking at them made our hair stand on end, and our hearts were filled with indescribable anger. Later, Dr. Xia pointed to two damaged Chinese planes parked on the airfield, and said: "We cannot but admire the bravery and composure of the pilots in these planes. When this plane was engaged in an air battle with the enemy in Nanxiong, although it had victoriously shot down the enemy, it had also suffered considerable damage itself. According to ordinary reasoning, the pilots would most likely have parachuted down to protect themselves. However, this pilot was still able to bring the plane back to the base with the greatest courage. This kind of skill and this great spirit are indeed worthy of respect from pilots all over the world..." He spoke with great enthusiasm, and we listened with great interest. Then he said: "Since Shaoguan began to suffer from air raids, many privately-run hospitals have successively closed down. Only one military hospital and our place are left. The military hospital only treats wounded soldiers and military personnel from the front lines, so for a year, all the civilians injured in the air raids have been treated here. Because of our hospital's funding, we still charge a considerable fee for patients, including food and lodging. First-class wards are one yuan a day, and second-class wards are 75 cents in national currency per day. For this reason, many very poor people are still unable to be hospitalized. We feel very uneasy about this, but we are powerless to do anything about it..." This "Hua Tuo Reborn" foreign doctor was right. During this period, on the one hand, he was serving, and on the other hand, he was actually learning. He said: "The injuries of civilians in the bombing are very different. If you rely solely on what you learned in school in the past, there is no way to cope with them. In the new era, treating diseases really requires diligent research and the use of various different methods. In this year, I have seen many unexpected ways of getting injured, and therefore I have also learned many new treatment methods..." As for medicine, Li Meng and his wife and I are all complete "laymen," so apart from sitting quietly and listening attentively, like a primary school student in class, there was really no way to interrupt. I felt that his experience was indeed very precious. When China is in the midst of a great era of turmoil, not only doctors, but people from all walks of life, must have the spirit of serving and learning at the same time. Otherwise, the changes of the times are too fast, and the changes in the environment are too many. Relying solely on old methods will definitely not be able to meet new demands.</p>
<p>Just as we were talking happily, there was a sound on the stairs, and then a very handsome blond foreign man ran up. Like Xia Dao-xi, he could also speak fluent and authentic Cantonese. He had been in China for two years longer than Xia Dao-xi, for a full nine years. Xia got up and introduced us to each other. He was a pastor at the local British church, named W. H. Alton, with the Chinese name Qu Dao-bi. This gentleman paid great attention to his posture when speaking, with the demeanor of Hollywood. Like the color of his hair, his small mustache was also golden yellow, sparse and soft, and looked very interesting. I thought to myself, why is it so strange today? Everyone I've met has a mustache. Could this be the feng shui of Shaoguan! The servant called to Xia Dao-xi, "The refreshments are ready!" So we ran into the living room, which was decorated quite exquisitely, and the refreshments were also very elaborate, with good canned milk, sugar cubes, and cakes, said to be mostly from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>After the refreshments, Xia accompanied us to visit the wards, pharmacies... Although there weren't many rooms, they could only accommodate about five or six hundred people, but the orderly and tidy appearance was lovely to see. Here, apart from Dao-xi, all the doctors and nurses were Chinese. Their relationship was very good, and their skills were also excellent. According to Xia, the standard of these nurses was no lower than that of nurses in many large hospitals in England. Later, we also visited a nurse's bedroom. The whole room was a snowy white. On the wall hung photos of Shirley Temple (transliteration, please use the most common one) and Xia Dao-xi. The innocent smile of this child star made the air in the house particularly relaxed and lively. I thought that if this beautiful girl's room was placed on the pages of a book about the entire situation in China, it would be like a pair of butterflies full of vivid emotions and beautiful colors, fluttering around the muzzle of a cannon filled with gunpowder. After leaving this "little paradise," on the opposite side, we could see many stoves that had been unused for a long time. It was said that in the past, family members could accompany patients into the hospital, and these stoves were used for the family members to cook for the patients. Now, because the hospital is crowded, the patients' family members cannot stay in the hospital, so these stoves have gradually become deserted! In the equipment room, there were many new glass cabinets and medical equipment. We asked Dao-xi in surprise, "Now that transportation is so difficult, how were these things transported here?" He replied, "This is entirely done by the local workers themselves." Learning in the War of Resistance, the workers' skills have also improved rapidly. We took a photo with the nurses and doctors in the hospital, and then shook hands with this valiant charity worker to say goodbye. Before leaving, I asked this "Friend of China" to write an article for our International News Agency, with his work experience as the theme. He agreed and said, "I'll hand it in tomorrow."</p>

<h3>Mobilizing the Power of the Entire Nation - President Chiang's Broadcast Address - Demonstrating the Great Significance of Spiritual Mobilization - To Be Fully Implemented Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] The Second Term of the Second Propaganda Week, President Chiang was respectfully invited to deliver a broadcast address at 7:00 PM on the 17th. The original text is recorded as follows: Compatriots across the country, we are now implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization. Starting next month, we must all follow the "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline" and its "Implementation Measures" promulgated by the Central Government on March 12th across the country. We will hold "National Monthly Meetings" to declare the "National Covenant" and also follow the various regulations stipulated in the "Outline" to encourage and supervise each other, and earnestly implement them. Everyone must know that this is the most important event related to the survival of the country, the life and death of the nation, and the success or failure of the War of Resistance. I ask our compatriots across the country, especially leaders from all walks of life, to pay special attention to this major event and sincerely promote it. Why is it necessary to implement "National Spiritual Mobilization"? This is already stated very clearly in the "Outline." What I want to emphasize again is that first, we must acknowledge that the greatness of spiritual strength surpasses all material forces and all military power. Second, we must reflect on the shortcomings in our spiritual aspects in the past. What is spirit? Our Founding Father said it most succinctly. Our Founding Father said, "Everything that is not material is spirit." However, our Founding Father did not say that spirit and matter are absolutely separate, but that the two are united and mutually supportive. Our Founding Father also said, "If humanity loses its spirit, then it must not be a completely independent person." Everyone, think about it, what a shocking lesson this is. If an individual loses his spirit, he is not a completely independent person. Then, if a nation loses its spirit, wouldn't it be a nation unworthy of independent survival? The art of war says, "Attacking the mind is paramount." The so-called attacking the mind is to strike at the opponent's spirit. Therefore, the success or failure of all struggles in the world depends entirely on the strength and weakness of the spirit. Tangible material or military strength cannot determine victory or defeat. Our Founding Father theorized about the use of weapons, which depends entirely on the spirit of the people. He once said, "Comparing the two, spiritual strength accounts for nine parts, and material strength only accounts for one part." All comrades who have participated in battles can cite countless examples to prove that this saying is accurate and irrefutable. We only need to look at since the War of Resistance, on our front lines, there are often less than a few soldiers who can resist the ×'s for several days, and even be able to repel ten times more ×'s. There are also old, weak women who can resist violence and kill × in self-defense with their bare hands. Many things that were usually considered unimaginable or impossible can become reality beyond expectations in difficult and dangerous situations. Therefore, only those who have lost their spirit can only see material things and not see spirit, only estimate tangible strength and ignore intangible strength. In fact, to defeat the ×'s and successfully build our country in this war, we must rely heavily on giving full play to the spiritual strength of every member of our nation. Moreover, the closer we get to victory, the more difficult, arduous, and dangerous our environment will inevitably become. We must mobilize the entire spiritual strength of our nation to seek final success. Therefore, at this critical juncture of life and death, success or failure, our compatriots must affirm the greatness of spiritual strength. This is the first point I want to explain.</p>

<h3>The "Hong Kong Telegraph" Publishes an Article: "Look at China!" - Praising Our Counter-Offensive Power - Shattering the ×'s Conspiracy for Peace</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the English "Hong Kong Telegraph" published an article titled "Look at China!" praising the power of our army's counter-offensive. From the exposure of the ×'s weakness, it revealed the victory of our country's future. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Three important pieces of news were released in Hong Kong last week: (1) British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, hurriedly returned to Chongqing from Shanghai; (2) The Chinese army launched a simultaneous counter-offensive in five provinces, achieving significant success in at least three provinces; (3) The sudden transfer of the American "Great Fleet" (totaling 120 ships) to the Pacific. Kerr hastily returned to Chongqing after meeting with Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, in Shanghai, leading to rumors of British mediation in the Sino-Japanese War. Craigie has affirmed that the content of the conversation with Kerr did not discuss mediation. However, why did the two suddenly meet thousands of miles away? Kerr refused to announce the purpose of meeting with Craigie and refused to meet with Hong Kong reporters on this trip, an unprecedented act since Kerr's arrival in China. Some observers here deeply believe that the three pieces of news mentioned above are directly related to the situation in Europe.</p>
<p>The Chinese army's active counter-offensive last week dispersed the Japanese army's strength, and its impact on Japan's finances and economy has obviously become increasingly heavy. China has been fighting alone so far, and the assistance given to China by the West is very small. However, China is still able to be indomitable. If the major Western democracies can provide large-scale assistance from now on, then the future embarrassment of the Japanese will be unimaginable. The result of China's heroic resistance to Japan's violent aggression has invisibly caused a major blow to the totalitarian group. Although Japan intends to respond to Germany and Italy in any disputes, given its current situation, it is powerless to do so. If it is absolutely necessary, it can only temporarily control the North Pacific, which is of no help. If the major Western European democracies can fully assist China and the Chinese army can exert its greatest power, then Japan will no longer be a threat to the European situation. Because under this circumstance, Japan is too busy to take care of itself, how can it provide any assistance to the Allied countries in Western Europe?</p>
<h3>Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, Arrived in Chongqing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, flew back here from Hong Kong this morning.</p>
<h3>Our Army Launches a Large-Scale Counter-Offensive - Fierce Fighting Outside Xuzhou - The Eighth Route Army Occupies Shijiazhuang - Successes on All Fronts in Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Hubei</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] In eastern Shandong, we have attacked the × for days, killing over 300 ×. We occupied Yao Gou, Yi Jia Chang Zi, and other stations on the Jiaoji Railway, setting them on fire and demolishing the rails, disrupting transportation. In western Shandong, we attacked × Cheng, annihilating over 30 × at Zhang Keng, capturing 28 people, and a large amount of military supplies.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 17th] According to Chinese reports, the Eighth Route Army, in cooperation with Shi Yousan's troops, has eliminated hundreds of small Japanese units in the Shijiazhuang area and occupied key military strongholds, sufficient to control the entire city. Several sections of the Pinghan Railway have also been destroyed by the Chinese army to cut off the Japanese army's reinforcement route in Pingjin. A Chinese army unit has also stormed into the city, re-occupying Shijiazhuang Railway Station. The fighting there is the most intense. According to another report, 70,000 Chinese troops are counter-attacking Xuzhou, and fierce fighting is currently taking place outside Xuzhou. Several sections of the Longhai Railway have been destroyed by the Chinese army, causing the front-line Japanese army to lose contact with the rear. The Chinese army's artillery has been bombarding Xuzhou, and undercover troops have entered the city to participate in the fighting, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Shanghai news, news of the Chinese army's victorious counter-offensive continues to be received here. According to the latest reports, Liuhe at the mouth of the Yangtze River has been recaptured by the Chinese army. Another message says that 20,000 Chinese troops are currently attacking Xuzhou in three directions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th] A certain unit of our army in northern Henan detoured and launched a fierce flanking attack on the side of the ×, who fled towards Bo'ai. Our army is now advancing towards Zhuan'ai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zao Yang, 16th] After our recapture of Shijiatian and Zhujiatian, the remaining × fled back to Xinyang. Our army pursued and attacked, arriving at Xian Mountain (three or four li west of Xinyang) on the outskirts of Xinyang at six o'clock on the morning of the 15th and launching a fierce attack. The battle was extremely fierce. Our army fought bravely, killing many ×. The fighting continued fiercely into the night.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 16th Dispatch] In central Hubei, our × has been engaged in fierce fighting with the × at Xiaojiadian on the Jingzhong Road for three days, killing over 200 × and destroying 5 × vehicles. Over 600 × are now resisting stubbornly on the high ground near Wudangdian. About 500 × in Zhongxiang City are actively blocking intersections and are very panicked. The × cavalry repeatedly attacked Majiaji from Jingqiao to attack our flank, but were defeated.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in North China is Besieged on All Sides - Intense Fighting in the Zhongtiao Mountains - Anti-Japanese Democratic Governments Established One After Another - Sino-Soviet and Other Countries Jointly Form a Bank</h3>
<p>[Xingji Electric, 17th] The situation is going smoothly as our army launches an offensive in various parts of North China. Yesterday, a telegram from Wuyuan reported that our guerrillas in northern Suiyuan launched another fierce attack on Bailin Temple, inflicting heavy damage on the ×. Conflicts between the Mongolian army and the × also occurred nearby. In addition, our army in northwestern Shanxi launched a counter-offensive on Jingle on the 11th night, attacking into the north gate. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Yuanqu Electric, 16th] The × in the Zhongtiao Mountains has suffered extremely heavy losses in the fighting for days. In order to reverse the decline, the × even released a large number of toxic gas shells, mostly sneezing and suffocating toxic gases. The intensity and bravery of our army's counter-offensive operations in the Zhongtiao Mountains for a week can be compared to the "Battle of Xinkou." What is different from the Battle of Xinkou is that this time the action is entirely our army taking the offensive, and our army is the initiator. A telegram from the front on the 15th stated that our army's artillery exerted great power when attacking Xia County on the 13th, killing and wounding a total of 500 ×. The × in Yicheng is also under our army's encirclement. Over 1,000 × in Quwo planned to rescue Yicheng and encountered our army at Nanfan Town and Dajiao Town. After fierce fighting until noon, the ×, due to heavy casualties, fled back to Quwo in a panic, and part of them fled to Yicheng. Our army has now advanced to the line near Yicheng and is engaged in fierce fighting with the ×. The number of × in Wenxi has increased to over 2,000. On the morning of the 15th, they launched a full-scale counter-offensive against our army in Ruyi Shangxia Chao (southeast of Wenxi). The war was extremely fierce, and the confrontation is still ongoing. Our army is also sweeping up the × in Zhangzhen and Weiguozhen (southeast of Wenxi), and another unit is continuing to attack the mountain temple.</p>
<p>[People's Revolution Society, Xingji Electric, 17th] According to news, the cultural circles' North China troop comforting delegation, Zang Yunyuan, recently presented flags to Commander-in-Chief Yan Xishan of the military region, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and various guerrilla detachments in North China on the western battlefield. They have now arrived at a certain place. It is said that cultural work in the × region is progressing rapidly. In many guerrilla base areas, the prototype of democratic politics has been completed. The people in the × region have been armed with both spirit and physical strength in the arduous struggle over the years, and are fully capable of dealing with the × for a long time.</p>
<p>[People's Revolution Society, Xingji Electric, 17th] According to news, the Sino-British-American-French-Soviet Five-Nation Joint Bank has its headquarters in Tianjin, and branches have been established in Shijiazhuang and Baoding. The Taiyuan branch is under preparation. Recently, banknotes of the bank have been found in a certain place, but the × strictly prohibits their use. Outside the new south gate of Taiyuan, someone has been shot for using the banknotes. The background color of the banknotes is pink, and the images of the leaders of the four countries of Britain, America, France, and the Soviet Union are printed in the four corners, with the image of Chairman Chiang in the center.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Clark Kerr Will Go to Chongqing Tomorrow to Return to His Post - Says There is No Special Mission</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 16th] British Ambassador Clark Kerr came to Yunnan from Vietnam yesterday. The reporter visited this morning. According to the conversation, this trip to Chongqing is to return to his post. In addition to maintaining close contact with the central government at any time, there is no special mission. The rumors that I met with Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie in Shanghai to discuss the Far East issue are not true. It is heard that the ambassador will fly to Chongqing on the 19th.</p>
<h3>We Purchased 1,300 Heavy-Duty Trucks - Driving on the Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>[Kunming Correspondence] Since its opening to traffic, the Yunnan-Burma Road has been extremely convenient for military transportation and foreign trade. However, there has recently been a shortage of vehicles on the road. The Central Purchasing Committee will order 1,300 three-ton and seven-ton heavy-duty vehicles from various countries to meet this need. The payment will be allocated from the British credit loan to China established in December.</p>
<h3>Hashimoto, the Leader of the Youth Party, Was Removed from His Post by the Japanese Military Department</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 17th] The "Mainichi Shimbun" here stated that the Japanese Military Department has dismissed Colonel Hashimoto. According to reports, the artillery team under Colonel Hashimoto fired on the British warship "Ladybird" in Wuhu in December 1937. He is also the leader of the "Greater Japan Youth Fascist Party."</p>
<h3>The Fall of Xinhui and Its Aftermath</h3>
<p>— He Xiyao</p>
<p>(1) The Situation Before the Fall</p>
<p>Since Daliang and Ronggui successively fell, the path of the × invaders' attack clearly indicated an attempt to control the Five Counties. However, the Xinhui County government and the public remained remarkably calm in this grave situation. On March 28th, the people of Xinhui were still living peaceful lives; merchants carried on with their business as usual, and students attended school as normal. Only the local military and volunteer police forces showed some signs of tension. Around 10 PM that day, news arrived that × forces had been spotted on Pig Head Mountain outside Beijie. Knowing that things were not looking good, many people rushed around to inquire whether the news was true or false, and many others began to feel anxious and uneasy. At this point, due to the urgency of the situation, the authorities prepared to evacuate the population, and shops began hiring boats to move goods. However, since it was already late at night, not much could be done, so most people waited until the next day. Still, a few left overnight, heading back to their villages. The 29th was the Huanghuagang Memorial Day. By morning, the situation had become extremely serious. The roads were jammed with fleeing crowds, carrying the old and the young, their clothes dishevelled and untidy, their expressions panicky. Most carried only some cotton bedding and a few items of everyday clothing. In Jiangmen and Xinhui, some shops were closed and boarded up, while others were only half-open, and business was almost at a standstill. That day, fourteen or fifteen × aircraft constantly circled the skies above Jiangmen, and bombs exploded non-stop near Jiangmen's county seat, often in batches of over a hundred. The fleeing people anxiously speculated about the unfortunate fate awaiting Jiangmen and its county seat. That day, people could only try to survive under constant bombing. The highway between Jiangmen and Xinhui was automatically destroyed and burned. Only the stone roads in the various villages were passable. Ferries to and from the villages were overcrowded, and countless people hired their own boats to escape. On this day, the population evacuated from Jiangmen and Xinhui exceeded fifty percent. On the 30th, Jiangmen unfortunately fell. Those in the Xinhui county seat who had not had time to escape, or who had remained calm and not yet thought about fleeing, now successively fled to the countryside. The county seat had become a ghost town.</p>
<p>However, it should be specifically pointed out here that in the hour before Jiangmen and Xinhui fell, all intersections were guarded by volunteer police, and public order was still very good. By the 31st, the sound of gunfire could be heard in the Xinhui county seat. However, what was most surprising was that even then, some hawkers were still doing business, and vegetable and pork stalls were still set up in the market. However, rice had become a precious commodity. On April 1st, the sound of gunfire became clearer and clearer. On the morning of April 2nd, the sound of gunfire was deafening, and people anticipated that engagements had already occurred on the outskirts of the county seat. Around 11 AM, Xinhui county seat, following Jiangmen, was declared lost. By 2 or 3 PM, × armored vehicles were driving down the streets of the county seat.</p>
<p>(2) A Platoon Leader's Account</p>
<p>When the Xinhui county seat fell, this reporter immediately braved the rain and fled to the countryside. Here, I met a platoon leader of the Xinshun Special Task Force. The reporter immediately inquired about the progress of our army's resistance, because the Xinshun Special Task Force had established many glorious achievements in this resistance in Xinhui. The following is a record of his report:</p>
<p>We supported Jiangmen and Xinhui for three or four days in this resistance against the × forces, and have already sacrificed many brothers. If there were no traitors guiding or collaborating from within, we are confident that we could have held out longer, even with our inferior weapons. These traitors are mostly a small number of local thugs and vagrants. This may be due to the inadequacy of our political mobilization work.</p>
<p>However, Commander Zhou, with tears in his eyes, said to the whole team of brothers, "It is not worth it to lose Jiangmen like this." At that time, I almost cried too. Later, Commander Zhou ordered us and the volunteer police force to defend the Baisha defense line to the death. We were even more determined to die, doing our best to prevent the × forces from breaking through. However, they finally used armored forces to break through. There were twelve armored vehicles in total, followed by several hundred cavalry. In order to preserve our strength, we were forced to withdraw from the first line of defense and hold fast to the Dahui village in the second line of defense. There, we used the favorable terrain to set up machine guns and hastily build fortifications. At that time, we only had ×× hundred people, including the volunteer police. That night, Commander Li Wuzi instructed the able-bodied men from various villages in Dongjia to destroy the section of highway from Dahui to Guabao Temple. However, because of the urgency, only half of the road was destroyed overnight. The purpose of destroying this section of highway was to stop the × armored vehicles from advancing. Soon, the security team came to reinforce us. Two cannons were set up in the mountains of Dahui village, and they thundered, firing at the × positions. The × forces must have suffered considerable casualties. On this defense line, the × army launched four offensives after several reinforcements, but they could not break through. However, what made us most excited was Commander Li Wuzi. For the sake of resisting the × forces, he didn't close his eyes all night, personally supervising the battle.</p>
<p>Later, in the midst of a fierce wind and heavy rain, we found ourselves in an unfavorable situation. We knew that we had to fight to the death, so we fixed bayonets and charged forward. Because the × forces had the cover of armored vehicles and cavalry, we fought and killed hundreds of × and puppet soldiers before reluctantly withdrawing and shifting our position, holding fast to the east gate of Xinhui county seat. But we couldn't hold out for long. × troops then encircled us from Huimin Gate, and we had to reluctantly retreat along the highway to Daze and other places, preparing to counterattack at any time. In short, the × forces attacking Jiangmen this time were mostly miscellaneous troops with very weak combat power. When the × forces came, the armored vehicles led the way, followed by the cavalry, and then the miscellaneous troops brought up the rear.</p>
<p>(3) The Tragedy of Xinhui</p>
<p>On the 30th, after Jiangmen was lost, the stores along Changdi were unable to move their goods due to the suddenness of the event, and many were looted. At night, local thugs and thieves in Hetou Mayuan, near the countryside on the Henan side, rose up, smashing doors and destroying houses. Even bed boards and furniture were looted clean. Because there was so much looting, some used boats to carry the stolen goods, while others used army towing vehicles. Raw oil, peanuts, and soybeans were spilled everywhere. It is said that a fellow in Pengjiang was shot dead by × soldiers for being unable to find a girl for them. The situation in Beijie was the same. Fortunately, when the × soldiers came, many women had fled. After the Xinhui county seat fell, the situation was like that in Jiangmen city. Stores were occasionally searched and robbed, but not often. The worst affected area was Chan Court Street, because it was close to the river and neighbors and local bandits entered through the back door, using boats to carry stolen goods. However, because the Xinhui county seat fell later, stores had some time to move some goods, so the losses were somewhat smaller. Those who had people guarding their doors fared better. Those who were unguarded were often smashed and destroyed. All roads were guarded by × or puppet soldiers. Pedestrians had to bow when they saw them, and even a few cents in their pockets would be searched and taken away. In the first day or two after the Xinhui county seat fell, people were rounded up everywhere to carry corpses, fill in roads, and build fortifications. After the work was done, they were given a dime or two. From this chaotic state, we can see how the × forces entice our people and the importance of our work in mobilizing the people. Moreover, the looting by ruffians and local thugs before and after the fall is a distressing situation, and it must be considered a major political lesson. In the second phase of the war of resistance, Chairman Chiang declared: "Politics is more important than military affairs, and propaganda is more important than combat." This is something we should redouble our efforts on.</p>
<p>The × Advance Team is currently stationed in Cen Richu's mansion. The × cavalry is stationed in the Dayunshan civilian hospital. The county government has been converted into the × Command Headquarters, heavily guarded. Passage is only allowed after 8 AM during the day, and no one is allowed to enter or leave after 6 PM. At night, it is a world of thieves. The × army even instigated the Advance Team to issue announcements pacifying the people, which was all nonsense. Because the people were not deceived, they then ordered the shops to reopen, otherwise their property would be confiscated. Some shopkeepers, who still had some goods left, had no choice but to half-open their doors. In order to restore prosperity, the × army gave some small favors and small amounts of money to the people. Sometimes they could buy seven or eight sheng of rice for a dime or two. At the Nantian Teahouse on Daxin Street, the × army gave several packs of biscuits, telling the staff to open for business. Gambling dens were rampant in the area around the southern corner of Daxin Road. Shops along the road that were guarded were forced to hang × flags, with the words "Welcome the Great Japanese Imperial Army" written on them.</p>
<p>In recent days, the × army has been busy building defensive fortifications in various places in the suburbs of the city. Sandbags have been piled up everywhere. Places like Xihekou and Dayunshan are all garrisoned by × troops, and passage is not allowed. Currently, our army is preparing a counterattack in a certain location. In the progress of this counterattack, we must overcome the errors of insufficient past political mobilization. Because if we can mobilize the people, all traitors can be eliminated, all local thugs and thieves can be cleared, and we can also build a strong people's force to drive the × forces out of Xinhui. The × forces are increasingly collapsing. The soldiers and civilians of Xinhui, let us get up and take action! Overcome our mistakes, launch a heroic and bloody battle, and defend our homeland!</p>
<h3>Significant Gains in Northern Jiangxi, Successful Guerrilla Warfare in Western Zhejiang, Our Forces Continue to Advance in South China</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 17th] In the Jiangxi battlefront, our forces have now firmly established an advantageous position. Our guerilla forces are extremely active in the suburbs of Nanchang. Our main forces are currently approaching Liantang and Xiangtang, causing extreme panic among the ×. It is reported that about a thousand × troops stationed in Nanchang city are plundering civilian property and massacring the people. Many corpses are exposed along Zhongshan Road, Zhengzhong Road, and Guohuo Road, and no one has buried them to this day. The situation is extremely tragic. On the night of the 14th, the × forces from Gao'an fired artillery shells at the southern bank of the Jinhe River and set off smoke bombs. At the same time, dozens of × soldiers attempted to cross the river in civilian boats. They were discovered by our forces and immediately engaged, sinking several boats and killing more than thirty × soldiers. Also, according to Shanghai news, our air force has been active on the eastern front recently. At the end of the month, they carried out a night raid on the Qiaotou Airport in Hangzhou. The × side suffered heavy losses. On the afternoon of the 13th, our planes again flew in formation to attack Hangzhou, dropping multiple bombs on Qiaotou Airport and conducting reconnaissance over the city for a week before safely returning to base. At that time, the × side used anti-aircraft guns to fire wildly into the air, but no × aircraft took off to intercept them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 16th] Our guerilla forces in Zhejiang have become even more active recently, focusing on impeding the × main forces on the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway. The area southwest of Wuxing is particularly intense. Our infantry and artillery forces cooperated to bomb Wukang, Sanqiao, and Shantang on the 11th, killing hundreds of × soldiers. Our forces have been engaged in fierce battles for days in Qingshan City and Shijiaqiao, eliminating over three hundred × soldiers.</p>
<p>[Wengyuan, 17th (Special Dispatch)] Our forces on both sides of the Zengjiang River have been besieging Zengcheng for days, achieving successive victories. On the night of the 13th, a commando unit occupied the north gate and charged into the city. Our main forces continued to advance, and on the 14th and 15th, they defeated the × forces which had repeatedly advanced from Shitang to the north, attempting to encircle us in the west gate area of Zengcheng. The troops immediately turned to Zengcheng to assist with the attack and occupied the city on the night of the 15th. The remnants of the × forces fled to Xiangluogang. In this battle, many × officers and soldiers were killed, and countless firearms, ammunition, and other military supplies were captured. Our forces also suffered considerable casualties. However, the Zengcheng city has been completely burned down by the × forces and reduced to rubble. In order to expand the victory of mobile warfare, our forces have advanced towards Taipingchang, flanking the invading × army.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Mabudashan (Report 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>Until March 20th, the brothers of the Third Battalion did not encounter strong resistance, yet they were ready to strike the enemy with considerable force at any moment. Five months of replenishment and training had given even a new recruit the air of a battle-hardened "old soldier," brimming with saturated battle intent. They searched, and the local people also searched. Everywhere were our eyes, everywhere our snares. Every day, the brothers brought farmers from several or more than ten miles away to report enemy activities to Camp Commander Cheng, inspected the intelligence gathered from various sources, and learned that the total number of enemies in the three strongholds was less than two thousand. The × troops in Yuegui city numbered no more than four hundred. Camp Commander Cheng decided to use the strength of two companies to attack Guozhen City in a plunging fashion, with one company as a reserve force, guarding against × forces outflanking our right wing from the direction of Xinkaitang near Maolipu.</p>
<p>The × forces, knowing their own weakness, attempted to defeat our advancing troops one by one. At 10:00 AM on March 31st, the × forces gathered 1,300 troops south of Guozhen City, supported by ten artillery pieces, to launch a counterattack against our forces advancing to the northern foothills of Mabudashan. Camp Commander Cheng immediately ordered the companies to occupy superior terrain and await the opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>The soldiers who had participated in several battles felt that a war without a free sky above them could not be called a war. Each of them had confidence in their ability to deal with the × forces and felt that a great achievement was at hand. They carefully concealed themselves in the pine forests, gullies, and dead angles of the × fire, only revealing the dark, round muzzles of their guns.</p>
<p>The × artillery began firing. In less than a quarter of an hour, more than a hundred rounds were fired. Camp Commander Cheng sat not far behind between the First and Second Companies, calmly observing the explosions of the enemy shells. His eyes revealed a smile, feeling that the × artillery had regressed again, either overshooting or falling short. He picked up a piece of shrapnel that had fallen behind him and found the inscription "Made in March of the 13th Year of Showa." "Haha, let's see how many shells you have left," he couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Shells continued to explode to the left and right, in front and behind of the position. The dust and the smell of gunpowder mingled, and some were incendiary bombs, setting fire to the grass and trees of the spring wilderness in places. The soldiers held their guns in one hand and broke off pine branches to put out the fire with the other. Private Wang Yuanming had a large piece of shrapnel fly into his chest. He opened his uniform, pulled it out with his hand, and tightly stuffed his uniform into the wound to stop the bleeding, continuing to focus his bloodshot eyes on the creeping × forces. He gripped a hand grenade with his trembling right hand and used his left hand to pull open the safety.</p>
<p>In front of the positions of the First and Second Companies, there was a dead angle. But they could see each other. When the × forces entered the dead angle of the First Company, the brothers of the Second Company shouted loudly, "First Company, Japanese ××× are hiding under your position, throw hand grenades quickly!" So the brothers of the First Company pulled the safety pins, "One, two, three," and threw them down together. The Second Company shouted again, "Good, five dead, there are still eight live turtles!" Another burst of "Beng," "Beng," and the "Imperial Army" let out a groan, dying like "Turtle Taro." When the × forces approached the Second Company, the brothers of the First Company shouted in the same way, serving as the death knell for the "Imperial Army."</p>
<p>The × army's machine gunners were accustomed to firing in three-round bursts, "Da, da, da," meaning, "Are you afraid or not?" Our Czech-style machine guns immediately answered with two-round bursts, "Da, da," saying, "Not afraid." Then they asked him again, "Afraid or not!" Individual firing also began. Sniper Zhang Qingxiang and a Japanese soldier were shooting at each other, neither giving way, dodging each other's shots within a hundred meters for more than ten shots. Finally, Zhang Qingxiang lost patience. He no longer dodged, and they fired simultaneously. After this shot, the other side did not raise his head again. He re-selected another target to shoot. Old Zhang was a good shooter who often scored thirty rings (note). This time, he was wounded after shooting his thirteenth × soldier.</p>
<p>Mortarman Li Hualong was from Shandong, as strong as an ox. He took the mortar barrel off the stand, clamped it under his arm, and had another brother observe in front, specifically targeting the × army's machine guns. In one breath, he fired thirty or forty rounds, making the × army's machine gunners only hate that there wasn't a hole to burrow into. He was too excited to fire when an × artillery shell pierced his chest, and he fell down like a small mountain. He lost too much blood and gasped, "Good brothers, I've already made a profit. I'm useless now. Please give me a finishing shot!" Camp Commander Cheng crawled over with tears in his eyes. Seeing that his intestines were also coming out, and there was no hope of saving him, he painfully ordered a brother to give him a finishing shot, and immediately sent a stretcher to carry him to the rear for burial.</p>
<p>There was an eighteen-year-old "good boy" from Baoji, Shaanxi. The brothers only called him "Little Chicken." He didn't care about his real name. He was hit by five machine-gun bullets in both calves. The brothers tried to persuade him to go down, but he angrily said, "Why won't you let me kill Japanese devils? I still have eight hand grenades. Whoever tells me to go down, I'll blow them up first!" He used two, killing nine × soldiers, and finally collapsed.</p>
<p>The fierce battle extended to 4:00 PM. There were no less than two hundred × corpses in front of our position. The × forces began to use artillery to assist the infantry attack again, and ten cannons fired wildly at the same time, shaking even the mountains. Camp Commander Cheng calculated that this was the × forces' last five minutes of struggle, and a purplish complexion shone on his oily black face. He stood up and shouted, "Brothers, are you afraid?"</p>
<p>There was then a burst of angry roars of "Not afraid!"</p>
<p>"Those who are not afraid, charge!" Camp Commander Cheng raised his … (To be continued)</p>

<h3>German and Italian Naval and Land Forces Concentrate in Spain, Britain and France Closely Monitor, Poland Protests German Aircraft Crossing Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The Times' diplomatic correspondent says that the British government's transfer of troops stationed in Palestine to Egypt and the dispatch of the Welsh Guards to Gibraltar both indicate that Britain and France are paying close attention to the Mediterranean and Spain. Large quantities of German military equipment have been shipped to naval ports and airfields along the northwest coast of Spain. Britain has also tightened its scrutiny of reports of Italian military actions in Spain, especially regarding when the Italian army's victory parade into Madrid will be held. The date was originally set for April 20th, then changed to May 2nd, and now to May 15th. The British government is clearly not satisfied with these changes.</p>

<p>Rapid Efforts to Strengthen the Peace Front</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] Britain is now taking major steps to bring the Soviet Union into the "anti-Hitler" group. France is also engaged in concluding a new agreement with the Soviet Union to provide automatic assistance in the event of a German invasion. The content of the new agreement will be that if France joins in resisting a German invasion, the Soviet Union will immediately provide assistance to Poland and Romania. Britain is also preparing to establish an air force agreement with the Soviet Union. However, the terms under which Britain and France will exchange for the Soviet Union's promise to assist Poland and Romania are not yet known. The new agreement will also stipulate that British and French military supplies for Poland and Romania will be transported through Soviet territory, via the Black Sea and the North Sea to Soviet ports. The Soviet ambassador to France has been instructed to begin negotiations with France, and the general staffs of both countries may hold joint discussions in the future. The British ambassador to the Soviet Union has also been instructed to hold discussions with the Moscow authorities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 16th] People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov received British Ambassador Sir Seeds this afternoon and held a half-hour meeting. Officials from both Britain and the Soviet Union have refused to disclose the content of the meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Negotiations on the "Peace Front" with the Soviet Union and Turkey have made satisfactory progress.

<h3>U.S. President's Peace Proposal Unanimously Supported Nationwide; Soviet Union Prepared to Participate in Cooperation; Important U.S.-Soviet Talks to Be Held</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The Washington correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" reports that President Roosevelt's courageous anti-aggression actions have garnered unanimous support nationwide. Although a minority believes that negotiating with dictators is futile and criticizes the President's adoption of an "appeasement policy," with some even criticizing the President for interfering in foreign affairs unrelated to the country, the unanimous tone of newspapers, the atmosphere in Congress, and especially the telegrams received by the White House, all demonstrate fervent support for the President's plan. What is particularly valuable is that even isolationists support the government. Senator Nye, one of the drafters of the neutrality law, stated that the government's actions at this time are a glorious move. The U.S. government is not discouraged by reports from Rome and Berlin. While they do not expect an immediate enthusiastic response from Germany and Italy, they believe that the dictators, recognizing the prevailing trend, will not shut all doors. The U.S. government believes that even if it ends in complete failure, its actions are entirely justified.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The U.S. State Department may not receive replies from the German and Italian governments regarding President Roosevelt's telegram within the next few days. According to well-informed sources, we do not acknowledge that the President is advocating that democratic countries should trust totalitarian countries, or should again adopt a policy of appeasement. Last September, when the European situation was tense, the President anticipated that the relevant countries would convene a meeting for discussion, but unexpectedly, the result was only a four-power conference, which abandoned a sovereign and independent country (referring to Czechoslovakia), and that country had no representative present at the meeting. According to U.S. officials, the President is now advocating that relevant countries hold talks, including the United States. Informed sources here wish to pay attention to the term "talks." They believe that "talks" do not necessarily mean convening a meeting immediately, but will first involve an exchange of views among all parties, and the establishment of an expanded and dignified non-aggression guarantee by each country. If there is a violation of this guarantee, other countries may cease providing economic assistance to the violator. Authorities here state that if the Axis countries can consider world opinion, they will not reject President Roosevelt's request.</p>
<p>Kalinin Cables Congratulations to Roosevelt</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] Today, Soviet newspapers published the full text of President Roosevelt's appeal to Mussolini and Hitler in a prominent position, without commentary. Political circles view the telegram as a practical and effective step towards maintaining world peace, and have clearly defined the aggressor countries, expressing their welcome. Although there are pessimistic views here regarding the future responses of Mussolini and Hitler, it is deeply believed that the Soviet Union will be prepared to participate in the international conference proposed by Roosevelt, and declares that the consistent policy of the Soviet Union is to mobilize all peace-loving countries to take collective action. The U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union will meet with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov today to continue the talks that began yesterday, but the content is still unknown. Kalinin, Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat, has sent a special telegram to Roosevelt congratulating him on his appeal to the dictators and expressing his gratitude. The telegram expresses the warm welcome of the entire Soviet people for the appeal and explains that the Soviet people are deeply concerned about the work of safeguarding world peace.</p>
<p>British Public Opinion Expresses Great Welcome</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The British press has expressed great welcome for President Roosevelt's proposal, publishing it in newspapers with large headlines. Last night, hopes for this proposal were extremely high, but later, due to Germany's cold official attitude, hopes faded again. The importance of the U.S. fleet's deployment to the Pacific is second only to Roosevelt's proposal. "The Observer" commented in an article that in this century, Central Europe has launched two acts of provocation against freedom, and these acts all originate from the same source. However, Britain, separated from Europe by three thousand miles, does not easily let them go each time. "The Sunday Times" stated that people around the world are paying close attention to the future responses of Mussolini and Hitler, but if they do not have the determination to keep their promises, it would be better not to respond. "The Sunday Dispatch" stated that the President's proposal can be seen as a significant contribution by an individual to mankind in history. "The Sunday News" believes that totalitarian countries will reject Roosevelt's proposal, and the United States will further amend the neutrality law so that the victims of aggression can enjoy its benefits more. Garvin, the editor of "The Observer," recently published an article stating that the current situation is as perilous as it was last September. "If we can safely pass through the next few weeks, then we can obtain a long period of peace, but it is difficult to foresee what kind of events will occur in the next few weeks. The best way to prevent problems is still to make open preparations so that opportunists know there is a limit. We must also prepare to resist actions to occupy key points, whether in the East or in the West, whether by force or by other means."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The Times said today, "The most important question for the German and Italian people is whether they have the right to convey the intentions of themselves and the people of other countries to their rulers. Intelligent British policy has never rejected the opportunity for peaceful discussion; on the contrary, it has resolutely obtained this opportunity, and has recently moved forward step by step, and has arrived at a time when we can declare, like U.S. President Roosevelt, that we speak of peace not because we are afraid or weak." And the "Daily Mail" said, "President Roosevelt's call for peace may cause the dictators to suspend their actions temporarily, but it will not cause them to abandon force and politics. If we want to achieve this goal, there is no other way than the force of democratic countries."</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Confer but Remain Unrepentant</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 16th] According to authoritative sources here, Mussolini and General Göring, after conferring in Venice for an hour this evening, immediately drafted a reply rejecting Roosevelt's proposal to express the positions of Germany and Italy. Reliable sources said that during the day, Mussolini and Göring spoke with Hitler twice before finally deciding to reject Roosevelt's proposal. Italy's formal reply will be delivered to the U.S. government within three days. Political circles here believe that the replies from Germany and Italy,</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit Germany; Will Meet Beck While Passing Through Polish Territory to Discuss Mutual Assistance Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 16th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is going to Germany for a visit and to offer congratulations to Hitler on his birthday. When he passes through the Polish city of Krakow tomorrow, Foreign Minister Beck will be there to greet him, so that they can discuss the extent of mutual assistance between Romania and Poland in the event of one or the other being attacked in the future, and consider the issue of unified military orders.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 16th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu left for Berlin this evening for an official visit, scheduled to end on Wednesday. After that, before Gafencu continues to Belgium and Britain, he may stay in the German capital for a few days in a private capacity.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister and Others Depart for Rome Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Budapest, 17th] Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki, accompanied by Foreign Minister Csaky, set off for Rome this morning for an official visit to the Italian government. This trip by Hungarian political figures has been planned for a long time. Those traveling with them include Hungarian Ambassador to Rome Villani and several senior officials from the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Budapest, 17th] According to a local evening newspaper, sources close to the Romanian government said that King Carol of Romania boarded the Romanian ship "Danube" today to go to a certain place to meet with Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, to discuss international issues, especially those related to the Balkans, due to Italy's annexation of Albania.</p>
<h3>Saito's Ashes Arrive in Yokohama Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Yokohama, 17th] The U.S. cruiser "Astoria," carrying the ashes of the late former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Saito, arrived here at 8:00 this morning. Both the U.S. and Japanese ships fired salutes to pay tribute to the deceased envoy. The U.S. ship, escorted by three Japanese destroyers, sailed into the port, berthed at buoy No. 10, and lowered its flag to half-mast in mourning. Other ships berthed in the port also lowered their flags. The Japanese Emperor has sent a telegram to U.S. President Roosevelt expressing his gratitude. Japanese newspapers praised the move, saying, "The U.S. government's transport of the ashes of the late Ambassador Saito back to his country shows the greatest respect for a foreign diplomat." Although they are completely different, individual replies should be adopted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 10th] According to reports, Mussolini and Göring have now decided to take a firm stance on Roosevelt's proposal. Once both sides have thoroughly discussed it, they will present Roosevelt with a strongly worded reply. People here believe that Mussolini advised Hitler to give Roosevelt a reply for the sake of international procedures. It is generally believed that Mussolini informed the Italian King of his decision this morning after accepting the Albanian crown. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, Ciano discussed the encirclement of Germany by foreign countries with Göring. It is said that Göring paid close attention to Italy's air transportation. Ciano informed Göring in detail about the recent situation of Italy's air force transporting Italian troops to Albania.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 16th] The full text of President Roosevelt's telegram was published in today's newspapers, but none of them commented on it, and only reprinted news of the negative reaction from Berlin below the text. Considering the current situation, even those in moderate political circles who once tended to welcome the telegram yesterday now find it difficult to expect President Roosevelt's wishes to be fulfilled. The telegram is considered by some to be "poorly drafted, weak in judgment, and petty in attitude, which is truly laughable."</p>
<h3>Hitler Returns to Berlin Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] Hitler has scheduled a Reichstag meeting for the 28th of this month, at which time he will present his response to the U.S. President's telegram.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Munich, 16th] Hitler returned to Berlin by special train at 9:00 this evening, and is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. Before Hitler left, he held talks with the Foreign Minister. People here believe that Hitler will not send a reply to Roosevelt before his birthday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] The "Frankfurter Zeitung" wrote in an editorial tone, "Germany and Italy's work to revise the Treaty of Versailles has not yet come to an end. They will continue to use their own strength to achieve their goals." The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" carried an article titled "Terror Against Germans in London," reporting on the mistreatment of Germans in Britain. [Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] The diplomatic mouthpiece "Diplomatische Korrespondenz" declared today that Germany will resolutely reject Roosevelt's proposal. The newspaper accused Roosevelt of supporting the encirclement policy of Britain and France, and said that the countries of Central Europe do not trust Roosevelt's telegram. As for when Hitler himself will reply to Roosevelt, it was not specified.</p>

<h3>U.S. Fleet Returns to Pacific; Japan Surprised; British Newspapers Say It Is a Planned Action; More Than 200 Ships Will Be Stationed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The Times correspondent in Washington, commenting on the movement of the fleet to the Pacific, said, "This movement of the fleet, as well as the import of tin and rubber into the United States, is clearly planned. This decision has made it impossible for the entire fleet to participate in the World's Fair in New York. After the fleet passes through the Panama Canal, about 270 of the 357 warships will be stationed in the Pacific."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] Naval circles here are deeply surprised by U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson's order for the U.S. fleet to move from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They believe that U.S.-Japan relations have only recently improved, and that with the situation in Europe becoming increasingly tense, the U.S. fleet should remain in the Atlantic to prevent emergencies. The Ministry of the Navy has declined to comment.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] The "Kokumin Shimbun" described President Roosevelt's telegram today as a "telegram war," saying that the world situation will not be affected by this telegram. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" expressed the fervent hope that the Pacific can maintain peace forever, and that the United States and Japan can prosper together and work together for world peace.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Guannan Guerrilla Army (Part 2) (Continued from the 14th)</h3>
<p>He is willing to contribute his own strength to build a new, independent and free China! Those brave soldiers he leads are equally admirable. They have left factories, classrooms, and farms, and bravely stepped onto the anti-Japanese battlefield. The hot blood they shed will irrigate a flower of freedom.</p>
<p>In addition to our love and support for these soldiers who defend the motherland, we would like to offer the following hopes from the standpoint of anti-Japanese comrades:</p>
<p>Chief Gao said: "The military discipline of the Guannan Guerrilla Army is precisely the art of war used by famous generals at home and abroad, and this valuable experience should be promoted and carried forward." However, we must further recognize that this war of resistance against Japan is different from other wars. Previous wars were mostly for the sake of the great achievements of one family or one person, and the purpose of the war was not dared to be told to the army and the people, so only strict laws and harsh punishments were used to force execution. This war is to drive the Japanese out of the country and establish a free and happy new China, and it is also for the liberation of the Japanese people and the masses and for world justice and peace. This bright and upright purpose of the war must not only be told to the anti-Japanese soldiers over and over again, but also be explained in detail to the backward masses, and even more, efforts must be made to carry out in-depth and extensive propaganda to the traitorous puppet troops. We cannot win by simply fighting with weapons against the Japanese today. Only by using this political war, internally, turning the officers, soldiers, and people into soldiers with a high degree of political awareness, so that officers and soldiers are united as one, and the military and civilians cooperate; and externally, disintegrating the soldiers of the puppet troops, so that they stand on the revolutionary front with us and work together, can we defeat the fierce Japanese! For example, regarding the phenomenon of desertion, as long as we do our political work well, they will not run away even if they are told to run, and even if there are occasional deserters, we can still use reason to persuade them. Therefore, in governing the army today, political work comes first, and strict laws and harsh punishments only play a supplementary role. In fact, only by doing political work well can military discipline be maintained. Chief Gao said: "We already have a political training department." This is a fortunate thing. We believe that under the leadership of Commander Du, a very good political work system will be established soon. Chief Gao also specifically mentioned that there have been misunderstandings with various parties in the past, and expressed his deep regret. We believe that in the war of resistance against Japan, "not only one must run fast, but everyone must keep up!" Because the work of resisting Japan is arduous. Only by mobilizing the efforts of the entire nation can we succeed. All officers and soldiers of the Guannan Guerrilla Army have a very strong anti-Japanese sentiment, and they can't wait to drive the Japanese away and immediately see the new China appear, so they have adopted a somewhat impatient attitude towards the masses, organizations, groups, and friendly forces in some places. However, historical habits are not easy to change, and social relations are even more complex. Everyone who does salvation work can only grasp the highest principle of "resistance to Japan is above all else, and everything is subordinate to resistance to Japan," and treat the masses, organizations, groups, and friendly forces with a polite and humble attitude, so that they can help each other, develop together, unite sincerely, reduce friction, and wholeheartedly deal with the common enemy - Japanese imperialism. Chief Gao said: "We already have a teaching department, and from now on we can contact all parties!" Yes, we believe that political work can overcome all difficulties.</p>
<p>Let these two paragraphs be my gift to the Guannan Guerrilla Army. In fact, these gifts have probably already become the tail of the facts, because all the officers and soldiers of the Guannan Guerrilla Army that we respect, under the leadership of Commander Du, have already been moving towards this goal.

<p>A Short Comment</p>
<h3>Look at China!</h3>
<p>The English-language "Hong Kong Telegraph" published an editorial yesterday entitled "Look at China," detailing the relationship between China and the European situation, and vigorously praising the recent counter-offensive power of our army. We believe that what should be noted is:</p>
<p>First, it proves the new recognition and trust of friendly countries in China's war of resistance forces. It points out that the international situation will increasingly tend towards a favorable future. It refutes the "peace" compromise and mediation arguments of a few, which are really not suitable for China today!</p>
<p>Second, it proves that the recent rumors spread by Japanese traitors that the British ambassadors to China and Japan are holding talks to resolve the war are groundless rumors. It also corrects the fact that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who is on his way to Chongqing, not only has no intention of "mediation," but will also help increase the friendly relations between China and Britain in response to the European situation. The international anti-aggression front is developing, and we must thoroughly smash the rumors and conspiracies of Japanese traitors for compromise and mediation!</p>
<p>Third, it further points out that in the past twenty months or so of China's war of resistance, it has created achievements that can be admired by the world, but China's great achievements are entirely based on its own efforts, and the foreign aid it has received is very weak. Therefore, it calls for if the democratic and peace-loving countries can give China more active support in the future, the Japanese aggressors will be unworthy of a fight. This is also a fact, and we must intensify our efforts to win greater and more sympathy and assistance from the democratic and peace-loving countries!</p>
<p>Look at China! It has grown stronger from the unprecedentedly difficult and bloody battles. It will no longer worry about the smokescreens of anti-communism and peace and the tricks of mediation from the Japanese and traitors - every Chinese who does not want to be a slave should strengthen their self-confidence and resolutely support united resistance!</p>
<h3>French Government Announces Wartime Measures; Is Recruiting Reserves; Plans to Evacuate Population of Paris</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Paris, 17th] France is gradually recruiting reserves into the army, and the teams are assembled very early in the morning. This move seems to contain some secrecy. The wartime measures taken by the French government have been announced in various newspapers, including the supply of gas masks and plans to evacuate the population of Paris. "Paris-Soir" reported that the authorities will issue leaflets informing people where they can obtain exit permits. The permit indicates the name of the railway station and the time of the train departure. The newspaper also stated that the evacuation order will be issued within 48 hours after mobilization. Special plans are also being made for the evacuation of groups of children in families and schools. Gas masks will be distributed after the sandbags are distributed. This has already been implemented in several places.</p>

<h3>Actively Strengthening Hong Kong's Air Force; Preliminary Expansion Plan to be Completed This Year; Anti-Aircraft Authorities to Establish Anti-Aircraft Station in Wan Chai; Change of Commanders for the Hong Kong Navy; Paddon to Succeed</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government has been actively strengthening Hong Kong's defenses in recent years. However, the expansion of the air force does not appear to be progressing rapidly. According to Western news sources, the British Air Ministry has adopted a proactive policy toward expanding the Hong Kong Air Force. However, due to the tense situation in Europe, the defense of the British mainland is of greater importance, which has led to delays in various colonies. Nevertheless, the British mainland's air force equipment will soon be fully completed. It is expected that the preliminary expansion plan for Hong Kong will be completed within this year, with several squadrons of first-line aircraft being transferred from Britain to Hong Kong. The second batch of aircraft will be supplied by Australia. As for Hong Kong's anti-aircraft artillery defenses, they have already reached a considerable level of strength. Furthermore, the Hong Kong anti-aircraft authorities have divided Hong Kong and Kowloon into 22 anti-aircraft zones, and experienced air defense personnel are teaching anti-aircraft knowledge to reduce the danger of enemy air raids. Classes are being conducted in each zone in turn. The Wan Chai District anti-aircraft training class also held its opening ceremony at the Dunmei School last night. Anti-Aircraft Bureau Chairman Pinli, Anti-Aircraft Commissioner Mr. Sparkin, Anti-Aircraft Committee Member Xie Jiabao, and others also personally provided guidance. According to Mr. Shi, the anti-aircraft authorities will establish an anti-aircraft station in the Wan Chai reclamation area so that residents living in Wan Chai can be protected in the event of war. Colonel Dickens, the British Naval Commander in Hong Kong and Commander of HMS Tamar, has recently been reassigned. The vacancy has been filled by the Naval Department with the appointment of Mr. Paddon, who will also serve as Superintendent of Naval Dockyards and Naval Construction. At the same time, the Naval Department specially appointed Lieutenant Reed of the training ship HMS Vindictive as Mr. Paddon's secretary. According to naval authorities, Britain has recently completed two shallow-water warships named HMS Dragonfly and HMS Firefly, both of which have been launched and placed under the command of the British Naval Commander in China. The two ships have already arrived from the Eastern Mediterranean. Each ship weighs 585 tons, slightly smaller than HMS Scorpion, the recently designated Yangtze River flagship after HMS Bee, but larger than the shallow-water warships built after the European war. There are currently two more ships under construction, with the same design as the aforementioned two ships, which began construction in England last year.</p>
<h3>New Central Market Duck and Chicken Stalls Suddenly Leased Ahead of Schedule; Health Bureau's Previous Notice Scheduled Interviews for Today; Some Merchants Dissatisfied and Appealing to the Governor</h3>
<p>The reconstruction of the New Central Market in Central has been underway for many years, and the project is largely complete. It is scheduled to open on May 1st. Merchants dealing in chicken and duck meat, as well as fruits and vegetables, are paying close attention to the opening date for bidding on the new market stalls, all eager to be the first to secure a spot. According to the notice issued by the Municipal Health Bureau some time ago, interviews with merchants bidding for stalls in the market were originally scheduled for 2:30 PM today (the 18th) to finalize the lease procedures.</p>
<p>Premature Interview with Some Merchants</p>
<p>However, according to a report in the "Hong Kong Daily Press" yesterday, their reporter learned that the Health Bureau suddenly interviewed a portion of merchants yesterday (the 17th) ahead of schedule. These merchants were the ones who had received prior notification from the Health Bureau. The circular stated: "Dear Sir/Madam, the bidding for some stalls in the Central Market is scheduled for 2:30 PM on April 17th. This bidding is limited to those with the following two qualifications: (1) those who previously leased stalls in the Central Market; (2) those currently operating in the South section of the Sheung Wan Market. Other merchants cannot bid today (the 17th). The above-mentioned bidding merchants must attend the Health Bureau in person. Those who win a stall must pay five or six months' rent in advance. The date of commencement of business will be announced publicly in May. This type of stall is only for retail sales; wholesale merchants cannot operate in the new market." The opening date announced in this circular contradicts the date announced by the authorities some time ago, which was 2:30 PM this afternoon. The reporter tried to investigate how many stalls remained today after the authorities interviewed the merchants yesterday, but had no clue. However, it is believed that those who bid early were only a portion of those who received preferential treatment and were seen first.</p>
<p>Most Merchants Feel Unfairly Treated</p>
<p>The merchants who were not interviewed by the authorities yesterday felt quite unfairly treated by the authorities' decision to conduct the interviews ahead of schedule. It is said that they are now appealing to the Governor, lodging a protest. This is because many of these merchants wanted to bid for the stalls in the Central Market, but they were never informed of the authorities' premature interview. The authorities never issued a notice of change of date beforehand; only a portion of merchants were notified. Some stallholders have engaged a barrister to submit a statement to the Municipal Health Bureau, questioning the reasons for the specially prioritized interviews. At the same time, fruit and vegetable vendors are also questioning whether the authorities' advanced date for the interviews applies only to chicken and duck stalls, and whether vegetable stalls would be similarly interviewed ahead of schedule. The authorities have not yet responded to this. Furthermore, a month ago, merchants intending to bid for the Central Market stalls submitted a statement to the health authorities, inquiring whether there would be any discrimination against bidding merchants when the market stalls were opened for bidding in the future. The authorities replied that there would be absolutely no distinction between them.</p>
<h3>Reservoir Water Increases After Days of Heavy Rain; Total Gain Exceeds Three Inches</h3>
<p>Since the heavy rains last Saturday, the water level in Hong Kong's reservoirs has risen sharply, with a total rainfall of over three inches. The total rainfall this year is eight inches and nine cents and four mils, exceeding the normal record by two-thirds of a mil. However, to solve the water shortage, continued rainfall is necessary, as the rainfall in Hong Kong last year was too low. There was also light rain yesterday, which should have increased the water level in the reservoirs. According to the Hong Kong Observatory's forecast, Hong Kong will have easterly winds and light rain in the morning. The temperature in Hong Kong was not affected by the rainfall. The highest temperature yesterday was 75 degrees, and the lowest was 69 degrees. The humidity reached 90 percent. An anticyclone is spreading over North and Northeast China and Japan, its momentum is slow, and blowing south into East China. A low pressure area is in the Ryukyu Islands and Tokyo Bay.</p>
<h3>Siam Suddenly Increases Cigarette Tax; Sales of Chinese and British Cigarettes Hit; British Tobacco Merchants Planning Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>The Siamese government recently imposed new taxes on imported cigarettes in order to reorganize its tax revenue and increase its financial resources. In addition to increasing the tax rate on imported cigarettes, it also issued stamp tax seals. All retail cigarettes in the market must obtain a seal before they can be sold, similar to the past tobacco tax measures in Guangdong. Otherwise, they will be punished for tax evasion. Since the promulgation of this new regulation, cigarette prices in Siam have increased, and the market has been in turmoil. However, in the Siamese cigarette market, the products of British-American Tobacco Company and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and other Chinese-funded tobacco companies occupy an important position. The annual sales of various cigarettes to Siam are huge, especially from the British side. Therefore, the Siamese government's promulgation of the new regulation increasing the cigarette tax rate has directly hit the sales of Chinese and British cigarettes, affecting business significantly. According to news from British tobacco merchants in Hong Kong, British tobacco merchants are paying close attention to this and are currently planning remedial measures, hoping to cope with this new environment to avoid any impact on the Siamese market. People in the British tobacco industry have reported to the government authorities and requested negotiations with Siam for improvement. The British Minister to Siam has had several contacts with the Siamese Minister of Finance, but the outcome is currently unknown.</p>

<h3>The World of Bandits; Armed Robbery Occurs Again in San Tin Village, Lok Ma Chau Yesterday; Five Robbers Break into House While People are Sound Asleep and Loot Everything; Total Stolen Cash and Jewelry Reaches Over $300</h3>
<p>For months, the New Territories have become a world of bandits, with armed robberies occurring frequently. Although the police have been conducting special investigations, they have not been able to curb the trend. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, in San Tin Village, Lok Ma Chau, New Territories, a widow named Chen Lian was robbed by five armed robbers who broke into her house and looted everything. The total stolen cash and jewelry reached over $300, amounting to daylight robbery. The following is a record of the investigation:</p>
<p>Sound Asleep Under Quilts; Five Robbers Break into House</p>
<p>A house without a door number in San Tin Village is inhabited by a widow named Chen Lian, 58 years old, along with two young daughters and two female relatives. Ms. Chen has quite a few savings, and her jewelry is dazzling, often catching people's attention. However, this attracted the attention of bandits, who suddenly launched an armed robbery. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, Ms. Chen and her two daughters and two relatives were sound asleep. Ms. Chen was suddenly awakened by the creaking sound of the door, knowing that something must have happened. She quickly got up and woke up her two daughters and two relatives, lit a lamp, and shouted to ask who was there. Unexpectedly, before she finished speaking, the door collapsed with a loud crash, and five men in black clothes rushed in, each holding a pistol and a flashlight, shining them on Ms. Chen and her companions, threatening them not to make any noise, otherwise the bullets would be merciless. Ms. Chen and the other four women were all women, and seeing the fierce momentum of the robbers, they were forced to remain silent, huddled in a corner, and wept softly. One of the five robbers was covering his head with a white cloth, making it impossible to see his true face, which suggested he was an acquaintance.</p>
<p>Wanton Looting; Leaving Quietly</p>
<p>Seeing that no one in the house dared to resist, the five robbers calmly took out iron wires and rags they had brought with them from their pockets and tied the hands and feet of each person one by one, stuffed their mouths tightly, and pushed them onto the bed. Then they searched each person one by one, robbing them of all the cash and jewelry they had with them. They pushed each person back into bed, covered them tightly with quilts, and had one robber stand guard with a gun. The other four robbers then began to search, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, leaving no stone unturned. As it was deep at night, the neighbors were all asleep and did not realize that the robbers were searching the house. After more than an hour, the cash, jewelry, and clothing in the house had all been looted. Each person carried their loot separately and quietly left the house, disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>Untied and Reported; Police Detectives Investigating Traces of Bandits</p>
<p>Before leaving, the robbers warned Ms. Chen and the others not to call the police, otherwise there would be consequences. Long after the robbers left, Ms. Chen and the others struggled with each other, untied themselves one after another, and then shouted loudly about the robbery and rushed to the Lok Ma Chau police station to report the crime. The officer on duty immediately dispatched Chinese and Indian police officers to search for traces of the bandits and telegraphed the police stations in various districts of the New Territories and Hong Kong to request assistance in the investigation. One party accompanied Chinese detectives to Ms. Chen's house to investigate everything. According to Ms. Chen, $34 in Hong Kong currency and $48 in small bills were stolen from her person. The gold rings, earrings, etc. of her two daughters and two relatives were all looted, and the gold and silver objects in the boxes and cabinets were also searched and emptied. The total loss this time was approximately HK$353.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association recently received donations from overseas Chinese in the Philippines to assist fishermen and built four fishing boats to support unemployed fishermen. The four new boats have now been completed and launched. According to the person in charge of the association yesterday morning, the association has scheduled a launching ceremony for the four boats at 12:00 noon on the 23rd of this month and has respectfully invited Ms. He Xiangning, a member of the Central Committee, to preside over everything. The location will be at the Xiangdao Theatre in Aberdeen, Hong Kong. The four boats were built with donations from overseas Chinese, so all figures are public. The names of the four boats are Spirit, Unity, Self-Reliance, and Renewal.</p>
<h3>National Bank Reduces Capital; Original Amount of HK$1 Million Reduced to Over $1.9 Million</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Savings Bank specially retained lawyer Lo Man Kam and hired barrister Pott to apply to the High Court to reduce its capital of $5 million to $1,923,080. The value of the bank's preferred shares remained unchanged, while the ordinary shares were reduced from $10 per share to $1 per share. According to Mr. Pott, the plan had been unanimously approved by all creditors. The debt without collateral, which had been ordered by the court in 1936 to be repaid in installments over six months, will be extended for one year. The purpose of the new plan is to concentrate the bank's debts to facilitate business operations. The bank has now repaid the fourth installment, but all creditors have agreed to the extension of the debt repayment period.</p>
<h3>National Christian University Holds Educational Conference in Hong Kong; Conference Scheduled for One Week, Started Yesterday; All Twelve University Presidents Arrived in Hong Kong to Attend</h3>
<p>The National Christian University Educational Conference is being held in Hong Kong. This conference will decide on future educational and administrative methods for Christian universities, and its nature is extremely important. University presidents and professors have arrived in Hong Kong one after another, including twelve schools: Yenching, St. John's, Soochow, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Union, Ginling Women's College, Lingnan, Qilu, Jinling, Ginling Women's College, and West China. The president of Huachung University was unable to attend due to urgent matters.</p>
<p>Conference for One Week; The conference began yesterday at the Bishop's House and will be held continuously for one week, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM each day. The conference will close on the weekend. Yesterday's and today's agenda items include reporting matters, with each university reporting in detail on their school affairs over the past year of the war. Discussion items will begin tomorrow. In addition to convening general meetings every day, separate groups will review various proposals in order to comprehensively present them for discussion.</p>
<p>Arduous Efforts; Since the war, all Christian universities across the country have been working hard in difficult circumstances, either because their campuses are in occupied areas or because they have been destroyed by bombing. For example, Yenching University in Beijing continues to operate in the occupied area. The four universities of St. John's, Soochow, Shanghai, and Hangzhou in Shanghai are jointly holding classes in mainland Shanghai. Jinling, Jinling Women's College, Qilu, and West China are also jointly operating at the campus of West China University in Chengdu. When reporters visited Dr. Miao Qiusheng yesterday, Dr. Miao said that the past and future educational policies of Christianity are based on two major principles: (1) the lives of faculty and students are protected, and (2) educational freedom. If these two principles can be preserved, then universities will continue to operate in difficult circumstances; otherwise, they would rather suspend operations. Dr. Miao gave a more practical and clear explanation of the second principle, saying that if education can be carried out in accordance with the educational policies set by the central government, then it will continue. Regardless of whether one is a Christian or not, it is gratifying that there have been no Christian students who have become traitors since the war.</p>
<h3>Chen Xilin Fails to Appeal in the Lin Bosheng Assassination Case; Original Sentence of Fifteen Years in Prison Upheld</h3>
<p>Lin Bosheng, the manager of the Hong Kong Nanhua Daily, was previously shot at on Avenue Central. The suspect, Chen Xilin, was charged with two counts of attempted murder and assault. The case was heard by Judge McKinley in the High Court last month, and he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. Chen appealed to the High Court through lawyers Luo Shibi and Mai Nan Mana, requesting a reduction in the sentence. The case was heard yesterday morning at 10:30 AM by Judge Lian Su and Legal Secretary Chuanli Shayanzhi. Deputy Legal Secretary Bao Landisi and barrister Liao Yali Mata represented the government. The defendant's lawyer first stated the reasons for the appeal, saying that the injured person was hospitalized for only one month, which showed that the injuries were not serious. If the defendant had intended to commit murder, he would have seriously injured the plaintiff and then removed his hat while he was lying on the ground before shooting him in the head. The defendant did not do this at the time, and the testimonies of the witnesses were also exaggerated. Therefore, the original sentence of fifteen years in prison was too severe. He then cited legal precedents to elaborate on the reasons. After reviewing the case, Judge Lian stated that the testimonies of the witnesses proved the circumstances of the defendant's crime in great detail and that the defendant was guilty of (1) loitering in the road with malicious intent and (2) possessing a weapon. Therefore, the original sentence of fifteen years in prison was not excessive, and the appeal was dismissed.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Circles Actively Soliciting Short-Sleeved Clothing; Solicitation Committee Members Departing Today to Solicit Donations; Please Ask This Newspaper to Collect on Behalf of the Association</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Frontline Soldiers Welfare Committee's campaign to solicit 100,000 sets of short-sleeved clothing in Hong Kong began actively on the 15th of this month.

<p>The Hong Kong Government Strictly Prohibits New Territories Residents from Cutting Down Trees Without Authorization; Carrying Knives and Axes Prohibited When Climbing Mountains to Collect Dead Branches</p>
<p>Due to the impact on the source of firewood in Hong Kong, there has been a firewood shortage, which has hit the general residents hard. Those who run firewood businesses have certainly made huge profits. Due to the urgent demand, many men and women have abandoned other operations and climbed mountains to collect various dead branches or cut down trees privately to sell to residents. For months, countless men and women have been climbing mountains every morning since dawn through the mountain paths of Pok Fu Lam, Happy Valley, and Shau Kei Wan to collect firewood. The New Territories are even more active. For months, peninsula firewood merchants have been going to the New Territories to collect firewood and transport it to Hong Kong for sale. The recent use of multiple trucks transporting the firewood daily is a clear illustration of this. According to reliable information, the Forestry Bureau believes that the cultivation of forests in the New Territories is closely related to the prosperity of local agriculture and should not allow local residents to cut them down at will, causing serious damage to the forests in the New Territories and indirectly impacting local agricultural production. Yesterday, it issued a notice to police stations throughout the New Territories, ordering police officers to conscientiously crack down on local residents climbing mountains to cut down trees. Anyone climbing mountains to collect dead branches is strictly prohibited from carrying knives and axes and other sharp objects; otherwise, they will be arrested and severely punished in accordance with the law. On the other hand, prohibition notices were printed and posted on public walls in various villages and at the entrances to various mountain forests, advising the general public not to break the law. Therefore, the transport and sale of firewood from the New Territories to Hong Kong will be greatly reduced in the future, and the source of firewood in Hong Kong will be somewhat affected.</p>

(2) A letter from the Zhongsheng Charitable Society requesting that the General Assembly inform the China Travelers Drama Troupe to reschedule their charity performance to avoid conflicting with the General Assembly's Huanghuagang charity performance to avoid impacting revenue.

(3) A letter from the Heshan Chamber of Commerce requesting the allocation of 200 bags of rice and sacks from the General Assembly to aid refugees. It was resolved that the General Assembly had a total of 300 bags of rice in storage. After allocating 100 bags to the Sze Yup Chamber of Commerce as previously agreed, over 100 bags remained.

<h3>Our Various Army Divisions Advancing Rapidly: Guangzhou Expected to Fall Soon: Gunfire Heard Within Guangzhou: Western River Forces Striving to Hold Firm</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shameen, Guangzhou] Our Northeast and Northwest armies have been fiercely attacking Guangdong for days, making rapid progress. Since the recapture of Zengcheng, the military's morale has greatly increased. Fourth War Zone Commander Zhang Fakui personally went to the front lines to command in an effort to recapture Guangzhou in one fell swoop. The Northern Route military operations are led by 12th Group Army Commander-in-Chief Yu Hanmou, who personally led the army southward. After several days of fierce fighting, the [enemy] could not hold on and retreated in disarray. Our vanguard is now approaching Guangzhou, only a dozen miles from Guangdong, and gunfire was heard in the market on the 16th. The [enemy] in Guangzhou is being deployed to the front lines for reinforcements. The defense of the suburbs is the responsibility of the puppet army led by Li Heyi, and only a small number of military police and civil defense corps remain in the city to maintain order.</p>
<p>Eastern Front Situation</p>
<p>After the recapture of Rizeng, we immediately took advantage of the victory to press on towards the [enemy] in the Shiqilong and Shitan areas, resulting in another fierce battle with the [enemy], the most intense in months. Subsequently, our large reinforcements arrived and attacked the [enemy] on three sides. The [enemy] could not hold on and retreated in disarray towards Shilong, where we surrounded the [enemy]. This battle completely cut off the [enemy]'s lines of communication. We have now established contact with our forces in Huaxian and are launching a major counter-offensive towards Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Northern Front Situation</p>
<p>After our recapture of Xinjie, the [enemy]'s flanks were attacked by us, causing the front and rear to lose contact, and they retreated in disarray towards Jiangcun and Shijing. We then divided our forces into two routes: one advanced south along the Guangdong Road, directly towards Guotang and Jiangcun, approaching Guangzhou, and the other moved east from Xinjie, circling around to attack south. After a day and night of bloody fighting, the forces had completed a large encirclement of Guangzhou by the morning of the [16th]. The [enemy] forces were extremely panicked and transferred forces from the Western River back to fortify Guangdong in an attempt to make a final stand. The order within Guangzhou is extremely chaotic, and guerrillas are often found in various locations.</p>
<p>Western River Situation</p>
<p>After days of active deployment by our Western River forces led by Deng Longguang, and with the assistance of the Guizhou army moving east, military morale has been boosted. Recently, with the successive victories of our Northeastern and Northwestern armies' counter-offensive, we have taken advantage of the momentum to launch a fierce counter-offensive against the [enemy] forces. The fighting on the Ningyang, Jiangmen, and Fuo lines has been extremely intense. The fighting near Zhuang is particularly fierce, with a bloody battle lasting a day and night, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of [enemy] soldiers. As of the morning of the 16th, the fighting was still ongoing. The various heights around [blank] Tangxia have been captured by us, and the [enemy] has been subjected to significant threats. In the [blank], Hecun area, the [enemy] forces have suffered heavy casualties due to repeated attacks by our military and civilians and are in a state of being overwhelmed. Yesterday, they forcibly recruited civilians to help build fortifications in an attempt to defend to the death, so the war in the Sze Yup region has become calmer.</p>
<h3>Zengcheng-Guangzhou Area Battles Still Fierce: Our Vanguard Units Only Separated from the [Enemy] by a River: [Enemy] Forces from Shitan Rushed to Support Zengcheng and Were Heavily Attacked</h3>
<p>[Express Dispatch from the Eastern River] After our Eastern River army recaptured Zengcheng on the 15th, in order to eliminate the remaining [enemy] forces, they immediately dispatched part of their vanguard to pursue the retreating [enemy] forces on the Zengcheng-Guangzhou and Zengcheng-Shitan highways. As a result, fierce battles broke out again with the [enemy] in the Zhucun area of the Guangzeng Highway. News was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Continued details of the military situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Battles on the Zengcheng-Guangzhou Highway Still Fierce</p>
<p>According to local military authorities, a telephone call received from the front line yesterday stated that our forces pursuing the remaining [enemy] forces on the Zengcheng-Guangzhou road had surrounded the [enemy] in Zhucun on the 15th. Subsequently, a large [enemy] air detachment arrived, and the [enemy] forces used the aircraft for cover, launching a counter-attack against our army. The two sides remained deadlocked all day. The outcome has not yet been decided. Furthermore, at around 5:00 AM on the 16th, approximately 400 [enemy] soldiers from Guangzhou, equipped with over ten steel cannons and several tanks, arrived from Guangzhou along the Guangzeng Highway to provide support. Upon receiving the report, our army took advantage of the [enemy]'s instability and concentrated its strength, launching a sudden attack on the [enemy] forces with swift tactics. The [enemy] was caught off guard by the counter-attack, and the formation was thrown into disarray. They stubbornly resisted and engaged in a bitter struggle with us. From the night of the 15th to the spring rain of the 16th, the sky was hazy, and the [enemy] aircraft could not operate extensively, so our army's operations were relatively smooth. However, the [enemy] continued to struggle bitterly. Therefore, the fierce battle continues, and they are still fighting in the Zhucun area. Our army is continuing to send reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Enemy] Forces from Shitan Rushing to Support and Suffering Heavy Losses</p>
<p>It was also found that on the same day, the [enemy] forces being pursued by us were in an extremely precarious situation at the time. The [enemy] forces in Shitan mobilized their entire force of over a thousand men, circling around the southwest of Zengcheng in an attempt to attack our army from both sides, to relieve the siege of the Zengcheng-Shitan and Guangzhou-Shitan routes. Upon receiving the report, our army secretly dispatched a certain unit to lie in ambush near Tingzigang, waiting in strict formation. After a while, the [enemy] indeed led with tanks, followed by over two hundred cavalry, covering a large number of [enemy] infantry, advancing rapidly. When the [enemy] approached, our army issued a command, attacked from all sides, and engaged in a fierce battle with the [enemy] forces. The [enemy] forces used tank cover and came on fiercely, but they ultimately could not break through our army's solid line of defense. After several hours of fierce fighting, the [enemy] forces were defeated. As a result of this fierce battle, both [enemy] and our casualties were heavy. Our main forces have now successively arrived in the Mou Mou area to block the [enemy] forces, preparing to inflict a heavy blow on the [enemy] if they invade.</p>
<p>Chi and Wang Set Deadline to Capture Shilong</p>
<p>Chi Zhongkuan and Zhai Rongji, commanders of the Southeast Coast responsible for the lower reaches of the Eastern River, and Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth District Guerrilla Column, believed that our main forces had recaptured [blank] Guangdong and occupied a dominant position. The [enemy] forces in Dongguan were indeed fundamentally shaken. With further pressure, success could be achieved. As Shilong was the most prominent [blank] on the Eastern Line, making it difficult for the [enemy] forces to defend, they decided to advance from this route. On the 13th, they specifically ordered the teams from Shangxia Nanshan, Shanpaitou, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Line to continue advancing, setting a deadline to capture Shilong. After receiving the order, our teams advanced in the rain. The vanguard units had reached the Shuinan and Wangwuzhou areas by the afternoon. It was found that the area was only separated from Shilong Town by a river, and the sounds could be heard. The [enemy]'s movements could be seen. The [enemy] forces entrenched in Shilong had destroyed all the bridges to prevent our crossing and counter-attack. At the same time, they used concentrated steel cannons to bombard our army's positions in an attempt to stubbornly resist. Gunfire could be heard in Zhangmutou, Tangtou, and Xiake.</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui Sends Telegram to Encourage Liang Baoren</p>
<p>It was also found that in order to contain our counter-offensive troops in Dongguan Shilong, the [enemy] had previously dispatched 300 infantry, divided into more than 20 electric boats and speedboats, to invade Shi'an. Liang Shiren, commander of the Fourth Detachment of the Fourth District Column Headquarters, led his troops to bravely counterattack, defeating the [enemy] forces and killing their commander, Major Yongtian, and over ten [enemy] officers and soldiers, securing Bao'an and eliminating the threats to the flank of our army. Their contribution was significant. Fourth War Zone Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui, upon receiving the report, believed that Liang's command was effective and highly commendable. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to encourage Liang, urging him to continue his efforts. It has been found that since the [enemy] invaded Bao'an and suffered a severe punishment, they have been dormant in Taiping in recent days, daring not to act rashly. Therefore, the defense of Bao'an is unusually peaceful, and the villagers in each district have mobilized to prepare to assist our army in the counter-offensive.</p>
<h3>Panyu Braves Bitterly Attack Traitors: Puppet County Magistrate Chen Temporarily Suffers Five or Six Knife Wounds: Overseas Chinese Township Head Dai Dies from Injuries</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Panyu] Since the fall of Panyu County, the [enemy] have instigated traitorous scum to organize puppet maintenance associations in various occupied areas, and pulled local tyrants like Li Mou to serve as puppet county magistrate, establishing a puppet county government, implementing its "appeasement policy" in an attempt to anesthetize the people of our various townships. However, recently, the people of these townships and nearby guerrilla teams have been extremely active, often launching attacks against the [enemy] troops, causing disorder in the various districts. The [enemy] side responsible for the county believes that the puppet county magistrate and the various puppets cannot maintain order. In addition to detaining and punishing some of the puppet maintenance association puppets, they have also decided to replace the puppet county magistrate. Upon hearing this news, the county's ugly mob attempted to compete for power and began fawning upon the [enemy] and lobbying the puppets of the puppet maintenance associations in various districts, recommending them to the [enemy]. Therefore, recently, the ugly mob of traitors have been running around lobbying in various directions, extremely busy. Chen Mou, the puppet township head of Shilou Township in District One of the county, set up a wife's residence at Zhongming School in the township at 6:00 PM on the 11th of this month, inviting the [enemy] in the county and the puppet leaders of various districts and townships. However, the young braves of the township learned of this and gathered more than twenty people, sneaking into the Dajingtou Street area near the school, waiting until late at night, around 9:00 PM. When the ugly mob dispersed from the banquet, they drunkenly left the school. When they reached Dajingtou, the young people lying in ambush there, taking them by surprise, raised their knives and wildly slashed at Chen, the traitor. With the fall of the knives, Chen, the traitor, was seriously injured. The puppets who were traveling with him fled in panic and were surrounded and beaten severely by the youth lying in ambush in Lizhiwei. The puppets shouted for help, but no one responded. Then, the young people, their goals achieved, left calmly. It was later heard that those who were injured included Chen, the traitor, who was severely injured by five or six knife wounds on his hands and feet, and five or six puppets who were severely beaten, including Dai Mou, the puppet township head of nearby Chishan Township, [blank] who died from his injuries. Since this incident, the traitors there have been extremely frightened, like frightened birds, not daring to go out at night, and begging the [enemy] to send more [enemy] troops for protection. The situation is truly pitiful and laughable.</p>
<h3>Li Hanhun Focuses on the People: Sends Personnel to Tour Guerrilla Areas: Promulgates Six Instructions to Strictly Prevent Malpractice: Shexun Team Reorganized into National Self-Defense Force</h3>
<p>[Express Dispatch from Shaoguan] During this second phase of the War of Resistance to win the initiative, Li Hanhun, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government and commander of the Military Control District, pays close attention to the armed people, especially to the value of military-civilian cooperation in the counter-offensive military operations. Therefore, he decided to reorganize the guerrilla teams in Guangdong. After sending personnel to various districts to supervise, he also reorganized the Shexun Team to increase its strength in order to win victory.</p>
<p>Inspectors on Tour Li has issued an order to the inspectors in various districts to provide on-site guidance and has sent Su Yuquan, Wu Junsheng, Yu Zuming, Xu Junyan, Liu An, Shen Ziqing, Peng Jiyi, Ma Dasan, Yang Guojun, and others to inspect the strength of the various teams and assist local officials in organizing and training.</p>
<p>Six Instructions After the inspectors received their orders, they traveled to various districts to quickly reach work in each district. Before the inspectors departed, Chairman Li issued six instructions: 1. Strictly investigate those who embezzle funds, seek personal gain, or hinder national and provincial tax revenues. 2. Strictly investigate those who use force to protect gambling dens. 3. Strictly investigate those who falsely report numbers and embezzle military funds. 4. Strictly investigate those who do not distribute funds as required. 5. Strictly investigate those who resist conscription by enlisting in the Self-Defense Corps. 6. Strictly investigate those who rely on power to act recklessly and domineeringly. They are also instructed to report the situation of the Self-Defense Corps in the subordinate counties and cities at any time for evaluation.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Shexun Team Chairman Li has also decided to reorganize the Shexun Team throughout the province to eliminate malpractice and achieve practical results. He specifically ordered the Shexun Teams in various places to be reorganized into the Military Training Department of the National Self-Defense Corps upon receiving the order. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to various places to comply, stating: Order to reorganize the Shexun General Team into the National Self-Defense General Team in accordance with the wartime national military training program. As for the implementation methods, they will be issued separately.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Losses from the Bombing of Liancheng: Total of Seventeen Bombs Dropped: Many Civilian Houses Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Southern Route] Recently, air raid alerts have been frequent here. [Enemy] aircraft often fly in groups over the airspace to attack Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. At around 8:00 AM on the 9th, the air defense command issued another alert. Eight [enemy] aircraft took off from the Weizhou area, flying in batches to San Niang Wan, Qianli, and other places for reconnaissance. At 10:20 AM, they entered the airspace of Liancheng City and dropped bombs. Our air defense forces immediately opened fire to shoot up, and the [enemy] aircraft also opened machine guns to return fire. A total of seventeen bombs were dropped. Because the county residents had taken shelter in advance, there were fortunately no casualties. The locations and losses from the bombing are as follows: A total of two bombs were dropped on Qinzhoutou Xiang Street, outside the city. One hit the open space next to Zhenxing Society on the left, and one hit the left side of the Zhong Family Shrine. Only two chickens were killed, and there were no other losses. The fourth bombing of Dabei [blank] Street resulted in a total of three bombs dropped. One bomb hit Deng Residence at No. 7 and Li Residence at No. 9, and the two residences were destroyed. Wu Residence at No. 7 was also affected and collapsed. One bomb hit the open space in the backyard of Jiang Residence at No. 18, destroying several sections of the surrounding wall. One bomb also hit the rear of the Zhuyuan area, destroying two houses. The Zhongshan Road County Fourth Elementary School teaching building was hit by one bomb, completely destroying the school office and reception room. Several nearby houses were also destroyed. The German Dehua Elementary School was attacked again, with one bomb hitting the playground and destroying the surrounding wall, affecting a young girl. One bomb hit the open space in Zhongshan Park, causing no losses. One bomb hit the side of Kuang Residence at No. 23, Xiasha Street, outside the city, completely destroying the main building and destroying the rear building.

One bomb hit Yang Residence at No. 42, Zhonggulou Market, only destroying several houses.</p>
<h3>Shantou Evacuates the Elderly, Weak, Women, and Children: Evacuation to Be Completed by the End of the Month: Boat and Train Fares Are Half Price</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Shantou] In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the authorities are determined to implement the evacuation of the population and the relocation of materials. The municipalities of Shantou and Chao'an have decided on specific evacuation measures. To expedite matters, the families of public officials have been evacuated in advance. Yesterday, Hua Zhenzhong, commander of the Chao-Shan Garrison, issued an order to the two municipalities to step up the promotion of evacuation: 1. Women, children, the elderly, the weak, and the unemployed are required to be evacuated by the end of this month. 2. All factories and schools must be relocated by the 12th of next month. 3. People who fail to evacuate by the deadline will be drafted into wartime units to assist in the task of the War of Resistance and will not be allowed to move freely. 4. If factories fail to evacuate by the deadline, all machinery will be moved and managed by the government. 5. Starting from the 16th, all boat and bus companies operating from the city to designated evacuation areas will offer half-price fares, but fares from the mainland to Shantou will be increased by 50% (e.g., a boat or bus fare from Shantou to Location A is one yuan, reduced to five mao; from Location A to Shantou is increased to one yuan and five mao). The families of the employees of the Chao-Shan Railway have also begun to evacuate.</p>
<h3>The Lessons of the Fall of Jiangmen (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yun</p>
<p>The poor organization of the political workers themselves led to their retreat in the face of battle. As for the other public officials, they also had the same problems. A few days after the war, several district chiefs were found to have fled. The corruption of the political institutions had long been revealed to us. We can cite an example. If we are not forgetful, we will remember the news in the Hong Kong newspapers about the "Detention of Electric Boat Carrying Comfort Goods." Because in addition to the comfort goods, there were also many other goods such as cloth, sugar, and noodles, which no one claimed and were suspected of being smuggled. I think, at least, public officials were also engaging in "seeking small profits." What time did they have to mobilize the people? Secondly, we know the situation of conscription in various villages. Of course, many people were hired to replace them, but the [blank] department in charge of conscription made many difficulties when checking the qualifications of the drafted men. If "money was used to replace people," there was "no doubt."</p>
<p>The lack of political mobilization in Xinhui also had other reasons. Everyone knows that when Guangzhou fell, perhaps because of military expenditure problems, a trick of gambling was carried out, taxes were intercepted, and 200,000 anti-war fees were collected. Later, it was gradually banned by the wise authorities. But unfortunately, when it gradually entered the "good state," the [enemy] had already entered the hall.</p>
<p>The author unwittingly said a lot about the dark side of Xinhui. But Xinhui is, after all, a rich area. In the past, to prevent bandits, many civilian guns were purchased, and the people were brave. If the organization of the militia was strict, it could exert great power. In this counter-offensive victory, we hope that the authorities will quickly improve Xinhui's political mobilization and defend the key to the West Southern Road - Jiangmen.</p>
<h3>Movies Are Also Drama: Guo Pei'er's Leisurely Mood: German Propaganda Minister Promotes Himself: Decided to Produce a Film This Year</h3>
<p>German Propaganda Minister Guo Pei'er has decided to personally produce a film this year. The script has also been drafted, and the tentative title is "Powerful Peace Lovers." The content will, of course, exaggerate the efforts of the German people for peace and will also try to portray the Jews as an extremely greedy and despicable nation. There are two main characters in the script, both of whom are lame. One is a pure Aryan who became a wealthy man because of his lameness, while the other, of Jewish descent, became a beggar because of his lameness. Some say, "This is Guo Pei'er's self-promotional film," because Guo Pei'er himself is a lame person of pure Aryan descent.</p>
<h3>Talking to Movie Stars by Telephone — As Difficult as Ascending to Heaven —</h3>
<p>Hollywood is a city full of "wrong telephone numbers."</p>
<p>To get through to a movie star's home is harder than a camel passing through the eye of a needle.</p>
<p>It is not very difficult to make a phone call to the President of the United States and get an answer. At least, even if the President does not answer himself, you can get a written reply. But it is extremely difficult to make a phone call to Joan Blondell. Not only does she often move, she also constantly [blank] her phone number, and she is at home very, very little.</p>
<p>Years ago, a decent young man did not have a fixed occupation, but his life was very comfortable. His only method was to bet with people that he could telephone the German Emperor living in Holland. He did make one or two calls, but if he were asked to call Errol Flynn, it would stump him. Errol Flynn's phone number is kept secret even from his manager and closest friends.</p>
<p>You can tell the telephone operator that you want to talk to the American oil tycoon, and you may be able to get a reply, but the same operator will simply tell you that she cannot connect you to James Cagney because, "This subscriber has instructed us not to disclose his number."</p>
<p>Movie stars only use the telephone to talk to their managers. Managers get a special reward for not telling people the phone numbers of the stars they represent. A few years ago, Win Morris was only a waiter on an Australian ship. It was easier to call him when the ship was four thousand miles from the coast than it is to call him in Hollywood now.</p>
<p>Someone who is familiar with the situation in Hollywood can call the restaurant where a certain star is if he knows that the star is in that restaurant and ask that the star come to the phone. Most stars will not refuse.</p>
<p>Only when their contract is about to expire will movie stars let others know their phone numbers, but once they have signed a two-year, five-year, or seven-year contract, they will feel that the phone will only bring them misfortune, and they would rather not use the phone.</p>
<h3>Movie City Tidbits</h3>
<p>Li Yuan, originally cast as the lead in "Pearl Shirt," was temporarily replaced by Mr. Jun due to a scheduling conflict. Therefore, Xinhua has now assigned him to co-star with Jin Yan in "Snowy Night Revenge."</p>
<p>Following "Wu Zetian," Fang Peilin plans to direct a children's film, likely influenced by "Orphan's Paradise."</p>
<p>The young star Mu Ling plays Lu Ming's childhood in the new film "Mysterious Lady."</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun recently appeared before Wang Yin with a combative attitude.</p>
<p>Elder Sister Yin Qiu, since marrying Xiao Wang, already has two copies, one male and one female.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan and Yan Fei, aunt and niece, have been very close recently.</p>
<p>Han Langan, because his black license plate car was being repaired, took a public bus on Avenue Joffre yesterday and suddenly encountered a pickpocket. Langan was quick-eyed and quick-handed, grabbing him immediately. The pickpocket hurriedly begged, "Mr. Han, please forgive me!" It turned out the pickpocket recognized this slapstick star. As for the "endangered" wallet, it contained nothing but an identity card. Mr. Han told me, "As for money, I hide it elsewhere."</p>
<p>Paramount's new film, "Prison in Hiding," is based on the latest work by J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Washington Detective Bureau. This is the first time the detective bureau director's "G-Man" type of work has been brought to the screen.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen "Fishing Boat Bloodshed" will have noticed the sea dog, Sleek, who played the friend of Dolores del Rio and George Raft.</p>
<p>In "Gold Rush Fishing Song," Sleek also plays an important role. Unexpectedly, during filming on the San Francisco waterfront, Sleek imitated Gandhi and went on a hunger strike. This worried his owner, Mr. Winsten, who, recalling how he loved to eat when filming "North Sea Fishing Light," quickly sent a telegram to a fish market on the Columbia River to have fresh fish flown in. Only then did Sleek happily resume filming.</p>
<p>The life of Constance Bennett, the "Flirtatious Female Ghost," can be divided into three parts: movies, cosmetics manufacturing, and household management. In addition to acting in films, it is said that most of the cosmetics she uses are manufactured by herself. In Holmby Hills, she likes to personally handle all matters, big or small, and she manages everything in an orderly manner.</p>

<h3>Happy Angel (3)</h3>
<p>Harry stared at her in astonishment, "Where did you learn those codes?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I wasn't born dancing either. I attended the University of Vienna and… I worked with Mr. Freud and Mr. Joss. They were all famous teachers."</p>
<p>"From the University of Vienna to this Omaha Idol!" Harry whistled, "That's quite a leap!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Van, this is my whole life," she said solemnly, "Today, on the top of a mountain, tomorrow, perhaps in the Dead Sea."</p>
<p>"Okay, I guess you're right, little darling. But you still haven't explained why you want to help Shirleyka."</p>
<p>"I did that just because... because I accidentally became a little interested in you. I... I think you have an outstanding mind."</p>
<p>Harry, already very agile, avoided her gaze, changed his clothes, and after hearing her say such words, curiously glanced at her. "So, you observed that, did you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she nodded seriously, "I also have an outstanding mind."</p>
<p>"And an outstanding way of speaking," Harry said mockingly, "Because a girl hangs all the turbulence of her life on her teeth."</p>
<p>"I was born a seeker of excitement," she said thoughtfully. "I have already experienced many surprises and dangers. Before my death, I will encounter even more such things."</p>
<p>"So, you're all prepared," Harry shook his head, "Well, are you planning to have dinner?"</p>

<h3>South China and Navy Championship Battle Changed to the 22nd Asahi Cup Third Game Held After the Inter-Port Team Returns to Hong Kong The Runner-Up of the Second Division League to be Decided Tomorrow in Kowloon</h3>
<p>(Our Special Correspondent) The 1938-39 football season is coming to an end. Of the six major championships, the remaining unresolved items are the First Division League and the Asahi Cup.</p>
<p>The last game of the league is South China vs. Navy. Since the scores of these two teams are higher than all others, and the difference is only one point, this last game is equivalent to the final.</p>
<p>In order to end the season early, the game was originally scheduled to be held at the Navy field last Saturday, but the heavy rain on that day caused the field to be flooded and unusable, so the game was postponed.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 5 o'clock, the members of the General Association Management Committee held a meeting to discuss the rescheduled date for the South China vs. Navy game. It was decided to hold the game at the Navy field at 4:30 pm on the 22nd of this month (Saturday).</p>
<p>The third game of the Asahi Cup, South China vs. Navy, was originally scheduled to be held on the 22nd. However, since the South China vs. Navy game has been changed to that day for the league championship battle, the Asahi Cup game has to be postponed and will be held after the inter-port team returns to Hong Kong. However, the date has not been set, probably in early May.</p>
<p>The exhibition match between the First Division League champion team and the inter-port team to the Philippines is scheduled to be held at the South China field in Caroline Hill at 4:30 pm on the 23rd (Sunday). If South China wins the championship, its players who are selected as representatives of the inter-port team will still play for South China. At 3:00 pm on the same afternoon, there will be an additional exhibition match between the Second Division League champion South China team and the Allied team at the same location. After the next game is over, the award ceremony will be held immediately.</p>
<p>The Asahi Cup is jointly organized by South China, Navy, and the Garrison Club, so the third game can be postponed until early May without conflicting with the closing date set by the General Association.</p>
<p>The runner-up of the Second Division League has not yet been decided, because the scores of Middlesex and the Fifth Battalion are equal, and a final must be held to determine the ownership. It is heard that it has been decided to hold the game at 4:00 pm tomorrow (Wednesday) at the Kowloon venue.</p>
<p>The General Association responded to the request of the Philippine side to send referee O'Ma with the inter-port team to the Philippines. It is found that O'Ma himself is also going to the Philippines for business and will leave first this Thursday. (The Football Field Authority)</p>
<h3>Last Night's Basketball Game, Star Island Defeats South China, South China Brothers Both Beat Police</h3>
<p>In the open men's basketball game last night, the First Division South China fought Star Island. Both teams are strong teams in this competition and are ambitious for the championship, so at this crucial moment of decisive victory, they both came to the battle with elite troops. The battle was fierce, unprecedented since the start of the competition. Star Island was strong and powerful and adopted a wheel-style strategy. After a hard fight, South China was repeatedly broken and lost with a score of 21 to 35.</p>
<p>Star Island's Dai Fucheng used his skills freely and repeatedly made miraculous achievements. Pan Yaojun's sneak attacks under the basket were ingenious. Liang Guoxian was brave and commendable. Li Peiyan and Li Shijie were both able to coordinate before and after. However, Zhong Zhiqiang's progress was slightly slow and no good work was seen.</p>
<p>Although South China's Huang Zhaode was brave, he was closely monitored by Star Island. It was difficult for one palm to clap. Chen Zanen and Chen Zanfu repeatedly advanced and retreated. Although Li Xiao and Zhong Ling were able to respond thoughtfully, Star Island's defense and offense were consistent, so it was difficult to avoid defeat. After Huang Zhaode was fouled out, he was even more surrounded. In general, the failure of South China was also due to insufficient strength.</p>
<p>After the two sides engaged in battle, Chen Zanen scored a penalty shot. Xin Yalang, Dai Fucheng, and Pan Yaojun were unwilling to show weakness and launched an offensive, winning repeatedly. South China's counterattack was also successful, and the score was tied at 8 to 8.</p>
<p>Seeing that the flames of war were spreading, Star Island invited Zhong Zhiqiang and Lu Zhenxuan to join the army. The military power was greatly enhanced. Li Peiyan and Pan Yaojun frequently launched cold arrows. Chen Zanfu and Zhong Xian also tried hard to catch up, but in the end, in the first half, South China lost by two points, 16 to 15.</p>
<p>Changing places to fight again, Liang Guozheng joined the battle, with a turbulent momentum. Dai Fucheng and Xin Yajun were seen advancing on two routes and scoring shots. At the same time, South China's Chen Zanfu and Huang Zhaode also broke through and made achievements under the basket. However, Star Island mobilized all its forces and the offensive was in full swing. Liang Guoxian and Dai Fucheng made a comeback and scored again. At this time, the score was 27 to 21, which was very tense.</p>
<p>South China's counter-attack gradually turned around, but Star Island again transferred the new force Li Shijie to the field. In addition, South China's Huang Zhaode was fouled out and the formation shook again, falling into a situation of being surrounded on all sides. At the end of the game, they lost with a score of 21 to 35.</p>

<p>In the next First Division game, South China fought the police. Both sides fought fiercely. The police took the lead bravely, and South China coordinated well. Shi Zhenzhi and Shi Zhenda shot with 100% accuracy and were invincible. Chen Xinquan shot from near and far, and his hands were like spring. Qian Jinghui, Zheng Yukun, and Jie Min advanced and defended, threatening the police fiercely.</p>
<p>The police officer Na Lianxing was extraordinarily brave, shooting from afar and capturing from near, with frequent reports of victory. Chen Jinkui also repeatedly made good works. Zeng Tingkai was monitored by the other side and could not make progress. Ba Baoxing guarded well and was able to fulfill his responsibilities. However, South China coordinated the entire army well and shot accurately. After a brave battle, the police lost with a score of 32 to 42.</p>

<h3>France Selects Ten Best Tennis Players Betara Ranked First</h3>
<p>The French Lawn Tennis Association recently selected Betara as the best tennis player in France. The reason for Betara's acquisition of the old position of Puseys is that he has achieved excellent results in the Taiwan Cup, British, and American competitions recently. Puseys is ranked second, but is still above Stymers, who is on par with Betara. The remaining seven of the ten best players are fourth, Brill, fifth, Fleire, sixth, Bilisha, seventh, Generno, and tenth, Geld Smith. British female athletes for next year's World Games</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Tennis Match Postponed Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Today's public lawn tennis match between Da Linzhen and Lin Tiande, originally scheduled for singles between He Jialiu and Xu Runpei yesterday, was postponed due to continuous rain and accumulated water on the court, making it difficult to play. If there is no rain today, there will be another singles match between Da Linzhen and Lin Tiande.

<h3>Hong Kong-Macau Port Team Football Match Hong Kong Team Wins 2-0 Over Macau Team</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The 12th Hong Kong-Macau Port Team Football Match, held in Macau, saw a group of twelve players from Hong Kong take an early boat to Macau on the 15th. They arrived at noon and officially clashed with the Macau team at the dog racing track at 3 pm. There was a large crowd of about three to four thousand spectators. The two teams also fought fiercely.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, the two sides attacked and defended each other, the situation was tense, and there were many exciting moments. However, the Hong Kong team was a notch higher and often created scoring opportunities, but many shots hit the post and bounced out. The ball luck was particularly bad. Later, Ho Sik finally scored a goal and finished the first half.</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight, one side wanted to maintain the victory, and the other side wanted to reverse the defeat. Everyone had their own thoughts, and the battle became even more spectacular. After all, the Hong Kong team was stronger, and Shang Sik made another contribution. As a result, the Hong Kong team won with a score of 2-0. Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai's performance was excellent.</p>
<p>In the previous two games, the Macau team won. However, in those two games, the Hong Kong team was represented by Second Division players. This year, at the request of the Macau side, First Division players were selected to go, so they won and returned.</p>
<p>Several players, including the regular starters Dehui, Zhuo Shijin, and Baijia, were unable to travel temporarily due to personal reasons. Holland Shih Hao was selected to supplement the team, and the team was able to win. As for Chen Guangyu, the inner guard of the Police Association, the team leader wanted to invite him to play because he had arrived in Macau in advance, but in the end, it was not possible, and Li Anna, who was traveling with the army, was still used as the right inner guard. The formations of the two sides during the war were as follows:</p>

<h3>Under Special Circumstances Customs Administration Destroyed Those with Difficulties in Implementation Should Reply According to Reason Export Tax Rates Should Be Handled in Accordance with Government Regulations</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Dispatch) Luo Fu, the Customs Commissioner of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, was forced by the environment to change the import tax rates under these special circumstances. As for the export tax exemption exceeding the collection tax, it is due to the government's encouragement of the export of domestic goods exempt from tax. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Customs Tax Exemption Exceeds Tax Collection</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs' export tax collection in August 1938 was 6,300,620 yuan, tax exemption was 14,894,263 yuan. In September, tax collection was 9,474,771 yuan, tax exemption was 18,145,985 yuan. In October, tax collection was 8,241,598 yuan, tax exemption was 14,660,309 yuan. In November, tax collection was 10,026,600 yuan, tax exemption was 20,193,813 yuan. In December, tax collection was 10,435,115 yuan, tax exemption was 17,514,399 yuan. In January 1939, tax collection was 11,384,241 yuan, tax exemption was 19,422,184 yuan. In February, tax collection was 10,531,048 yuan, tax exemption was 18,641,536 yuan.</p>
<p>Measures Under Special Circumstances</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Customs yesterday and learned that after the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, the tax revenue of the Shanghai Customs was intercepted and changed to be held by the Japanese-owned Zhengjin Bank. Japanese customs officers were added, the flag was forcibly changed, and import tax rates were reduced. In name, it is still a Chinese customs, subordinate to the General Tax Administration, but in reality, the customs administration has been destroyed. Regarding the export of native goods, the settlement of foreign exchange, and the investigation and prohibition of goods supporting Japan, the General Tax Commissioner Mei Lehe, after receiving orders from the Ministry of Finance, ordered the Shanghai Customs to comply. Because Customs Commissioner Luo believed that there were difficulties in reality, he replied that he could not comply with the process. It is heard that he has obtained the understanding of the General Affairs Department.</p>
<p>Encouraging Tax-Free Export of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>The value of export goods from various customs in our country, the tax collection is more than the tax exemption, but the Shanghai Customs is the opposite. The outside world does not know the truth. But in fact, the export tax of Jianghai Customs has not been changed after the war. The tax rates are handled in accordance with the government's regulations. Because Shanghai has always been the center of industry and commerce in the country, there are many domestic goods processing factories. It is now a place where domestic goods are concentrated for export. Now the government encourages the export of machine-made domestic goods and major native goods, and all orders are allowed to be exported tax-free, so the export goods of Jianghai Customs, tax exemption exceeds tax collection. Among them, 70-80% of the tax-free goods are machine-made domestic products.</p>
<h3>Wartime Currency Situation in Fujian Province: Circulation Volume of National and Provincial Banknotes</h3>
<p>(Yongan Correspondent) Fujian Province has long been connected with overseas regions, but its commerce has not yet been modernized. Most of the currency is hoarded, and the velocity of cash circulation is far behind that of Western countries, and even inferior compared to the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately investigate the amount of currency in circulation. However, since the central government issued a general order in November of the 24th year to implement the new currency system, thanks to the efforts of the provincial authorities, the amount of banknotes in circulation has greatly increased. After January of the 25th year, the amount of banknotes issued by various banks in Fujian Province also saw a sharp increase. Taking the Central Bank as an example, the monthly amount often reached around 12 million, breaking the record for the highest amount of banknotes issued in Fujian Province.</p>
<p>In August of the 26th year, the Shanghai Battle broke out, and the whole country fell into a state of war. The demand for currency in Fujian's market was unusually urgent. The monthly issuance amount of the Central Bank once exceeded 13 million. Although it soon stabilized, it was still enough to indicate the wartime commercial situation in Fujian Province and the consolidation of the legal tender's credit among the people. In addition to the Central Bank, there were also the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Joint Savings Bank, which were designated by the government as national banks. Their issuance amounts have increased since July of the 24th year. As of August of last year, the Bank of China had increased from 741,000 yuan to 53,083,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications had increased from 309,000 yuan to 2,487,000 yuan, and the Farmers Bank of China had increased from 222,000 yuan to 2,743,000 yuan. Among these four national banks, the Central Bank had the largest amount of banknotes issued, followed by the Bank of China, then the Farmers Bank of China, and finally the Bank of Communications. Since the implementation of the new currency system, the China Industrial Bank, because it was not designated by the government as a national bank, gradually withdrew the banknotes circulating in the market. By March of the 26th year, there were only 33,000 yuan in the entire province. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the market lacked currency, and as a temporary measure, the issuance of banknotes was still allowed. The bank's issuance amount increased to 63,000 yuan, but compared to the past, it was less than one-third. The face value of the banknotes of these five banks, except for the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank of China which occasionally had subsidiary currency notes, the lowest was one yuan, which was convenient for large transactions, but small transactions were greatly inconvenienced. This shortcoming needs to be remedied by local banks. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>British Sports Tax Reaches One Million Pounds Annually</h3>
<p>[London Correspondent] The British Treasury receives as much as one million pounds annually in tax revenue from sports. If a player is transferred from one club to another, the Treasury receives another payment. In this way, the entertainment tax on sports amounts to one million pounds annually.</p>
<p>Take Jones as an example. When he was transferred from Wolverhampton Wanderers to Arsenal, the transfer fee was 14,000 pounds. However, Wolverhampton Wanderers is a thriving club, and whether they sell Jones or not, they make money. They sold Jones and gained an extra 14,000 pounds. However, even so, Wolverhampton Wanderers did not actually receive 14,000 pounds in benefits. Out of these 10,000-plus pounds, they only received 14 shillings and sixpence per pound. That is to say, out of these 14,000 pounds, 4,000 pounds went into the tax collector's safe.</p>
<p>However, strangely, although the Treasury receives 4,000 pounds from the transfer of Jones, sometimes a struggling Third Division team, when selling a player even better than Jones for 15,000 pounds, may not receive a single penny, because the sale of a loss-making club is not taxable. In this way, when they sell a player for 10,000 pounds, they actually receive 10,000 pounds. However, a club cannot put all the money it makes this season into improving the stadium and report that the money has been used up and no profit has been made, because only expenses for maintaining the current state are considered legal. If you put the profit into improving the stadium, the tax collector will not recognize that you have not made a profit. At this time, the income tax from selling players will still have to be earned from your own pocket.</p>
<p>Therefore, you must not understand what is going on. Wolverhampton Wanderers sells a player for 6,000, 7,000, or 8,000 pounds, or whatever amount, but receives less than three-quarters of the amount. But at the same time, a small club sells a player for 6,000 pounds and puts every penny of it into its pocket.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Wolverhampton Wanderers buys a player for 10,000 pounds, they only receive something worth 7,250 pounds (if they can only get that amount when they sell). But if a small Third Division club buys a player for 5,000 pounds, they actually receive 5,000 pounds worth of "goods."</p>
<p>As for the one million pounds in entertainment tax, half of it (450,000 pounds) is obtained from football (football, English rugby, rugby league). In addition, about 20,000 pounds from cricket, 250,000 pounds from horse racing, and 270,000 pounds from other sports such as racing and greyhound racing.

<h3>The Revelation of Children</h3>
<p>— Zu De</p>
<p>On Children's Day, I bought two toys—a machine gun and a tank—and gave them to two little children. Unexpectedly, both of them wanted the gun and the tank. I said that fighting a war requires division of labor and cooperation, each performing their own duties: the one firing the gun doesn't drive the tank, and the one driving the tank doesn't fire the gun. However, unexpectedly, they said: "Put the gun on the tank, one hand drives the tank, and the other hand fires the gun—bang, bang, bang—won't we wipe out all the ×× together?" I had nothing to say, so I had to buy another set for them.</p>
<p>Modern children are truly much smarter. Regardless of whether putting the gun on the tank is reasonable in combat, they do not follow old ways, are not deceived by your words, and are full of creativity. This is a new trend of 20th-century children, worthy of our attention. Moreover, they do not demand things from people in a forceful way. They use their thoughts and words to say things that make you praise or admire them and love them, so you cannot help but buy things for them. What sophisticated methods these are! They are only six or seven years old, yet they already exhibit such behavior. This is a positive result of modern elementary education. Compared to the effect of us reading the "human hand foot knife ruler" textbook in our childhood, it is much more brilliant; and compared to reading the "Three Character Classic" and "Hundred Family Surnames," there is a world of difference. I firmly believe that in ten or twenty years, our country will definitely not have lazy and incompetent people who blindly follow old ways, or fools who are deceived but do not think and still act recklessly, becoming social parasites and willingly becoming sinners of the nation.</p>
<p>One day, the two of them were "charging into battle" on the balcony. Suddenly, one of them cried, crying very sadly; the other one said very straightforwardly: "I'll pay you back, I'll pay you back!" It turned out that one child had broken the other child's tank.</p>
<p>Why was he crying so sadly? A tank isn't worth a dollar. Think about it: he never even thought about the issue of money. He only knew that his beloved toy was damaged, causing him sadness. Because in his pure heart, some traces had already been deeply imprinted—guns and tanks, or rather, a part of their little souls had already been poured into their beloved toys. How could he not be sad? Therefore, the direction in which a child grows depends entirely on the environment they are in and the things they come into contact with, which stimulate and elicit responses. Therefore, the foundation created by using this "childlike innocence" is difficult to be influenced by external forces. According to news reports, children at the Xuying Academy in Xiamen wrote slogans such as "Down with ××, Return Our Rivers and Mountains" during Children's Day, which is a very good piece of evidence. Recalling famous sayings such as "Early childhood education and elementary education are the lifeline of the country" and "The responsibility of the country lies on the shoulders of elementary school teachers," we cannot but be vigilant!</p>
<p>Furthermore, that one child was very frank. He broke someone else's toy and would only compensate! He did not lie, did not forget his responsibility, and believed that "one person is responsible for their own actions." He did not "insinuate" and shift blame onto others. This attitude is much more upright than those who clearly do something wrong but do not admit it, and instead go against the grain and stubbornly persist in their own way. However, there are many people in the world who wear masks, from high-ranking officials to peddlers, putting on a show and echoing each other. Today they write an "Essay on ××," and tomorrow they "give an example." This kind of behavior is truly inferior to that of children. Even the words in the song that children sing, "I live for China, I die for China," they misunderstand or even do not understand at all. Although they have spent decades drinking ink, it is to no avail. From this, I say: "They should learn from the children!" Recalling the two old sayings, "Having ambition does not depend on age, being ignorant is in vain even after a hundred years," I cannot help but applaud!</p>
<h3>Moonlit Night to Xuzhou</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>——Reminiscences of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou</p>
<p>Tong Village is a rather large village with about forty to fifty households. The spacious tile-roofed houses are more numerous than the sorghum-thatched cottages, a rare phenomenon in the North. It is about thirty miles away from Xuzhou, but for some reason, all the common people have fled. Every room is so empty, the furniture is casually arranged, and the thin dogs that have lost their owners and have been hungry for many days are timidly curled up in the corners, sleeping. They no longer dare to jump up and howl when they see strangers.</p>
<p>When we were in southern Shandong, the female comrades of the several war zone service groups who had been sent back returned to the team because the Longhai Railway was cut off. We heard that Xuzhou was in great danger and that there were no common people left. However, everyone still hoped to get to Xuzhou quickly, to defend that important military town and prevent the × people from trying to open up the Xupu Railway through Xuzhou!</p>
<p>× planes circled in the sky all day long, so the people and horses remained holed up in the houses, letting them waste more gasoline and ignoring them.</p>
<p>At 7 PM, we set off again, carrying a mortar shell and advancing along the highway in the darkness. The yellow dust flew up in thick clouds, covering people's bodies in a thick layer of yellow dust. Their nostrils were filled with mud, and people kept coughing. ...</p>
<p>A small village, bisected by the highway, was completely destroyed by the × planes. A thatched cottage was burned down by incendiary bombs, leaving only two fire-reddened earthen walls standing upright in the ruins. People were buried under the rubble, emitting a foul odor.</p>
<p>As if we had seen some kind of ghost, the nauseating stench was unbearable, and we couldn't help but run forward.</p>
<p>The moon slowly rose from the dim wilderness, and trees and villages emerged from the darkness. The clear moonlight shone palely on the sleeping wheat, which was still and motionless, enjoying the warmth of the moonlight.</p>
<p>Because we were waiting for the distribution of flour, the brothers stopped in a long line on the highway, preparing to receive the flour at Xidian before the team slowly continued its advance.</p>
<p>Because we couldn't wait for the flour, we shouldered the mortar shell and decided not to take the flour. In the bright moonlight, we walked for more than two hours on the thick yellow dust-covered highway, passing several protruding small hills, and arrived in Xuzhou.</p>
<p>This was no longer the Xuzhou we had passed through a month ago. At that time, Xuzhou was hot and bustling. Now, Xuzhou was dead. The houses on both sides of the street were like they had contracted some kind of infectious disease, all collapsed. Rubble lay on charred rafters, and the walls without roofs stood straight, as if complaining about the brutality of the × people. There was not a single person on the street. The rough footsteps did not even elicit a howl from a stray dog. The whole scene was one of desolation and terror, as if we had walked into some kind of dead city.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a car loaded with flour came running from the front. We hurriedly stopped it and asked for ten bags of flour. However, everyone saw that there was no way to carry it away, so we piled the flour and the mortar shell on a broken cart by the roadside, and seven or eight people pushed and pulled it along. It took a lot of effort to push it to the outside of the south gate, but we couldn't push it any further. We had no choice but to hide the ten bags of flour in a small thatched house by the roadside, and carry the mortar shell. In a burst of urgent gunfire, we hurriedly caught up with the team in front.</p>
<p>Da-da-da... the clear sound of machine guns rang out, and the rumbling sound of artillery also echoed. The air was so tense that it seemed about to explode. The people and horses just advanced quickly.</p>
<p>Sweating and laboriously shouldering the heavy mortar shell, I walked behind the team. Although I was a little surprised that the × people had already reached the outskirts of Xuzhou, I didn't expect that this would be the last day for Xuzhou, and that the next day (May 19th) the × people would enter Xuzhou.</p>
<p>We walked silently. When a dim dawn broke that day, a × plane flew in from behind, and the team hurriedly scattered into the wheat fields. It disappeared. The × plane flew away, and the people and horses once again formed an iron stream, surging forward.</p>
<h3>"Little Devils" in the Northwest - They Serve as Buglers, Messengers, Cooks, and Odd-Job Workers</h3>
<p>More than 20,000 homeless Chinese refugee children, coming from all parts of China, have joined the Eighth Route Army in the Northwest to fight against Japan. Most of these children are between eleven and sixteen years old, so they are still too small to handle military equipment, but they serve as buglers, messengers, cooks, performers, and odd-job workers. Generally, people call these children "little devils." In every military camp, they are the happiest. They wear motley discarded military uniforms, often mismatched, and receive the same monthly allowance as regular troops, one yuan. One sunburnt-faced child told people that being a "little devil" is much more interesting than being a starving ghost in the fields in the Japanese-occupied areas. He left his hometown at the age of twelve and joined the army commanded by General Zhu De. Now, this child is generally considered very important, because he is the only one allowed to stand guard at the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army. Not many of these children have received education, but after joining the Eighth Route Army, they receive literacy education every morning.</p>
<p>They are known for their endurance and hard work. One fourteen-year-old child followed a team of officers on horseback for a day, walking forty-three miles. By 9 PM, the camp was set up, and he was still busily preparing beds for the officers like a squirrel.</p>
<p>In the evenings, these children often sit together and earnestly discuss various issues related to military science or political science that they have heard from the teachers during the day.</p>
<p>In every military camp, the "little devils" have their own military organizations and elect their own officers. One of the codes of honor they swear to uphold is similar to that of the American Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Hundreds of children who joined the Red Army long ago during the civil war are now officers in the Eighth Route Army.</p>
<p>After undergoing military training, the "little devils" are the most reliable element in the combat force. For this reason, military commanders often choose their own guards from among them.</p>
<p>In addition to the "little devils," there are also thousands of Chinese youths, both male and female, in the Eighth Route Army, recruited from secondary schools and vocational schools all over the country. Now, they are engaged in various relief efforts behind the Chinese defense lines. Along the battlefield, from the front lines to the rear, there are hundreds of service stations. These young people are members of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. The service stations have medical equipment, books, magazines, kitchens, stoves, utensils, a small amount of rice, and boiling water. Many of the young people working at the service stations themselves admit that they ran away from home in order to fulfill their responsibilities to the war.

<h3>War of Resistance and Poetry</h3>
<p>— Xu Ting</p>
<p>Why has poetry after the Three Kingdoms era been so particularly developed in the literary world? Perhaps it is because of the great chaos in the world, and that writers and authors were all on the battlefield or wandering from place to place, and no longer had the time to bury themselves in books to write longer works. However, even in that chaotic era, people's emotions never disappeared, but rather grew in a special way, filled with tragic and stirring passion and lingering and mournful sorrow. As a result, this short and highly expressive form of poetry was greatly utilized and developed.</p>
<p>Now, the national War of Resistance: a great era has been unfolded. The literary world is currently preoccupied with the question of "why there are still no great works of art." I do not think this is so. I believe that this should be an era of great poetry creation.</p>
<p>According to an editor of a certain supplement, poems account for a very large number of the submissions received by literary publications, and this is precisely the reason why. However, every publication (of course, except for poetry publications) is restricted by the rule that poems should only account for one-eighth of the total content, and writers are also constrained by this, so poetry cannot be expanded. This is also the reason why modern poetry is not as developed as it was during the Three Kingdoms era.</p>
<p>We know that poetry is not inferior to other forms of literature; on the contrary, it is more convenient to write and has more emotional power. In our country today, writers are naturally like the writers of the Three Kingdoms era, on the battlefield or wandering from place to place. Even if they are temporarily settled, they are constrained by the need to use the format of essays to launch fierce attacks on the × people, traitors, and all corrupt elements, or to explain the meaning of the War of Resistance to the public in a thorough way. Therefore, although they have good subject matter, they do not have the time to engage in the creation of great works of art. However, the creation of poetry is not hindered; the short form is rich in emotional expression. If these publications can break the one-eighth rule, poetry will undoubtedly make rapid progress.</p>
<p>Let us sing the praises of the great achievements of this great era!</p>
<h3>Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>——The former is for her, and the latter is for him; between the two, although there is the same welcome and the same sincerity, the words and tones are mismatched and contradictory. Therefore, she regarded those who pinned their hopes on the fate of the motherland as enemies. Were these youths, who looked like rich men, the valiant soldiers who were engaged in arduous struggles? Were the touching photos of impoverished valiant soldiers that she had kept merely a deceptive miniature of them? Was the donation she had given to the valiant soldiers given to these extravagant spendthrifts of the wealthy? Her erroneous imagination went to infinitely far. She wanted to shout to them:</p>
<p>"You liars, I have been deceived for too long!" Because she did not know that their beautiful clothes were rented and temporarily borrowed, a false exterior. Her simple heart and eyes had not experienced the complex world.</p>
<p>Those strangers whom she had mistaken for wealthy youths, spendthrifts, and liars, surrounded Yu Wen, held his hands and feet, lifted him up high, and then swayed him in the air, expressing their gratitude and celebrating the success of his work. In their almost frantic swaying, his hat fell off and was trampled out of shape, and the buttons on his clothes came undone, revealing a torn shirt. He was like a child's toy - being played with to the highest degree, almost to the point of being damaged. Their laughter and the sound of shoes hitting the floor merged into one, making it difficult to distinguish. At this time, the world seemed to have only this one indistinguishable sound. They swayed him, spinning around the room, from one corner to another, and from one corner to the middle of the room. The room was no longer large enough for their activities. Only the simple tables and chairs were crowded and could not find a suitable place to stand still for even a moment, as if they had a sense of feeling and jumped along with them. Their revelry seemed to be the old motherland's moment of happiness.</p>
<p>In this revelry, she alone was neglected, under surveillance as if an abandoned orphan, unheeded. So, she beat her own chest with her fists and jumped up and down; in this way, she seemed to be able to relieve her stifled breath.</p>
<p>When Yu Wen saw this, he understood - he had forgotten her in his own revelry, exacerbating her annoyance and aversion. So, he immediately broke free from the hands of his comrades. He ran over, threw himself at her, wanting to hug him - the only acquaintance she now had, the only protector in her imagination. She couldn't help but pour out her complaints to him:</p>
<p>"If I had known you were bringing me to such a terrible place, I would rather have died in the street!"</p>
<p>He pulled her closer, gently stroking her shoulders with his fingers, and smiled at her, as if coaxing a child.</p>
<p>"Look, who dares to bully you!" Then, he said to all his comrades:</p>
<p>"From now on, no one is to upset Miss Zhu Lin. Treat her as our own little sister!" He turned to her and said, "If anyone makes things difficult for you, tell me, and I'll take responsibility!" (40)</p>
