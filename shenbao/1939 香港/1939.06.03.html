<h3 id="c1">蘇聯重申外交政策 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 健生</p>
<p>五月卅一日晚，蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫在議會發表重要演說關於　聯對目前國際情勢所持態度，有極坦白的說明，對於今後國際動態及中國抗戰，自將有相當重大的影響，這是我們所不能忽視的。</p>
<p>第一，莫氏重申蘇聯最高領袖斯達林於三月間聯共十八屆大會上所報告的蘇聯外交政策，特別鄭重聲明的「堅决反對侵略者」「堅决援助爲國家獨立而奮鬥的被侵略國家。「兩點。莫氏首先痛斥最近日偽軍對外蒙，挑釁及其陰謀，並嚴重警告日本說：「蘇聯對於保護外蒙邊境之心，與保護本國邊境之心同其堅决。……我們的忍耐也有一定限度。日「滿當局倘識時務，就應該及時終止其不斷向蘇蒙邊境侵擾的所爲！』莫氏繼又鄭重聲明：「君等固巳稔悉斯達林氏所發表的聲明卽是關於援助爲國家獨立而奮鬥的被侵略國家。這種聲明，完全適於正在爲民族獨立而奮鬥的中國。我們已不斷在實際上履行此項政策，且與蘇聯在歐洲方面組織和平國家反侵略聯合戰線一項工作的原則，亦完全吻合。　我們並不想對於蘇聯外交當局這種宣示作過分的或特殊的信賴，但是我們不能不承認蘇聯外交當局此種宣示，有與其他資本主義國尤其是法西斯侵略國家截然不同者，就在於蘇聯國民經濟的發展國防力量的充實，上下完全一致的協力，及其在國際信譽的日益增高，卽社會主義精神道德的政治的旗物質力量之鞏固，與發展，都巳成爲此　宣示的保證，因此我們可以預斷，日偽軍對外蒙的挑釁事件、就會遭受校去年張鼓峯事件當時更大的打擊而自暴其醜態；而蘇聯援華工作之積極進展，亦當不止於在偽滿與內蒙邊境之牽制連緜數千里的日偽軍而巳！在我國立場而言，對於蘇聯此種明朗與熱誠的表示，除了欣慰與感謝之外，自當更加努力推進中蘇兩大民族爲民主與和平而合作奮鬥的事業，並且要努力促請英美法各國一致協力於此種偉大與神聖的事業，以同抵抗民主，和平與人類文明的×人—法西斯侵略者！</p>
<p>第二，莫氏針對英法兩國關於締結英法蘇互助協定的共同建議，重申蘇聯對此所持明朗的堅決的立場。我們曾經一再指出一般人士對於這一談判所作主觀的揣測之錯誤，指出一般空洞的樂觀論者和惡意的失敗論之同樣跨越事實，因爲英法財政資本統洽者之重視其國家民族與世界和平的利益，並未能超過其私人的階級的利益，亦未能澈底覺悟目前無論如何必須澈底放棄「半截政策」的重大的意義，因此就在最近的對蘇共同建議中，除了向侵略者示威和緩和國內反對××的情緒的意義之外，還缺少積極的有效的完成英法蘇互助協定與反侵略陣線的基本因素，而復牽延時日，致授侵略者以可乘機會以及誇大宣傳「英法全部接受蘇聯建議原則」企圖轉移失敗或遷緩實任這兩點，同樣不容忽視。現在莫氏在其演詞中複述斯達林所提出的警語「蘇聯抉不替人蹈火取栗』，當莫氏報告至此之時，全體代表歡　雷動，斯達林，伏羅希洛夫李維諾夫等政軍外交負責要員亦參加喝釆歷時五分鐘，觀此尤可想見蘇聯今日的嚴正的態度，對於反侵略運動中之一切遷緩的動搖的偽善的傾向，自將爲，種嚴重的教訓。</p>
<p>然而莫洛托夫演說不僅沒有增加英法蘇互助協定談判的困難，並且有力地推動了這種談判向正確的路上進行，促使向組織有效的反侵略陣線與樹立集體安全之路進行。莫氏重新宣示蘇聯外交的基本原則說，「蘇聯澈底主張聯合所有愛好和平國家，共同抵抗侵略」，莫氏還重新宣示蘇聯對英法蘇互助協定熱誠而嚴正的態度說，「蘇聯堅持三國互助協定，必須其有絕對防禦性質，保證蘇聯一切　邦，並訂立具體協定，如果簽字國之一方遭過攻擊，其他簽字國必須　實援助』。這兩點不僅明白阻止英法兩國利甲英法蘇互助協定以爲對德意談判爭取『勝利」的工具，並且就英法議中承認負有相互責任部份，指出英法此種「已進一步」之表現，可以作爲今後英法蘇互助協定可能完成的前提，因又積極地教訓英法兩國，祇有完全根據蘇聯建議的原則，建立歐洲以至遠東的集體安全制度，始能眞正有效地阻止及戰勝法西斯侵略者。我們相信莫氏這篇演說，必將增加蘇聯和平政策　國際上的信譽，必將增加各國廣大民衆的奮鬥的勇氣旗決心，亦必將增加英法兩國的進步政黨以至政府當局的覺悟，而向眞正的有效的反侵略統一戰線之途邁進，這也正是反證了那些對於英法蘇合作與反侵略運動發爲惡意的失敗論者的沒有根據。</p>
<p>蘇聯外交政策的再一次的宣示，無疑的更將增高蘇　保衛和平的政策在全世界範圍的信譽，無疑的更將鼓勱一切民主和平國家與被壓侵略國家反侵略統一戰線的發展，我們英勇抗戰中的中國，更應抓住這個國際形勢的有利條件，加强我們的團結與爭鬥。</p>
<h3 id="c2">抗戰中的僑胞生活　暹越馬概況　中華步行團團員董樹花講 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>【吉隆坡通訊】中華步行團南洋隊團員董樹花，陳福源，蔡舜琴等，經七年拔涉　行七國，頃抵吉隆坡，應該地尊孔，坤成兩校聯合之請，於下午二時半在尊孔禮堂演述該團步行經歷之各地情况，幷舉行影展，到會參觀及聽講者，有兩校之男女師生九百餘人，由主席致歡　詞畢，卽請董樹花君演講，茲探錄其演詞於下：</p>
<p>安南概況</p>
<p>我們跑出了鎮南關外，足跡便踏上安南國土了，大家都知道這個二千餘年的我國藩屬之邦巳在公曆一八八四年李鴻章手中與法使締結的天津條約，便輕經地讓它的板　變色，而且失掉了這個屬國時，我國的睦軍由雲貴總督岑毓英，廣西提督馮子材率領出關和法軍交戰，一連克復了幾個名城，在諒山的地方還把法軍打個落花流水，這個敗訊傳到巴黎，法國朝野大爲震恐，但我軍的捷報則遲遲未　北京，李鴻章是個議和的能手，不顧前綫的軍　如何，便慌忙的締結了和約，承認安南給法國作保護國，我國和安南藩屬的關係，至此便吿斷絕。打了勝仗還喪失土地，也許世界的歷史是找不到第二件吧。</p>
<p>安南的居民有安南人，東埔寨人，　族，占　，老撾人等和安南人與華人的混血兒。其中安南人佔全人土的十分之七，是被統治各民挨中最大的民族，人種屬蒙古種，穿着保留我國明朝的服裝，居住的磚　瓦屋也和我國的款式無異，食物以米粮爲主菜肴無非魚肉蔬菜之類，言語文字受我國的陶冶，原早是通用華文，語言的綴句排列也和我國相同，後來法當局的文學字拉丁化，並探爲安用的國語，方才把華文廢棄，可是現在年老的安南人，還是認得華文。其他婚喪喜慶的儀式，概依我國的習慣，人民素質的　　和剛毅，世無非沐受我國的文化，才得成爲一個優秀的民族。</p>
<p>其後的民埃如東埔寨人，老撾人，汰族，占族等皆爲優勢侵入的民族，後來逐漸發展，散　于安南各部，其生活的情形，各自保守一種習慣。如有機會我們再逐一分別陳述此刻暫且從略。關于華人與安南人的混血兒，他們的風俗習慣，却完全和我們華人相同，可是法律上已一部分變成是安南人了。</p>
<p>目下法國統治安南，以總督爲行政長官，負責執行全屬的政治，軍事，外交，司法，社會，財政等政策，駐節河內，另置副總督的交趾，其餘如東京，老撾，東埔寨等邦，各置鎮守史或特派員，直接受河內正總督節制，原有的皇宇和各部落酋長，雖仍雜用原號，但皆徒有其名，毫無發揮權力可能，這數十年的法人統治過程，也嘗發生了三次民族鬥爭的歷史，最初是安南的皇室和地主反對帝國主義的統治，率領人民起而反抗法軍，次爲農民要求改善生活的集體武力，再次是人民受到亡國的痛苦，羣起要求民族解放，但是三次的民族鬥爭都沒有成功，我們明白世界上被壓迫在鐵蹄下的民族，只有聯合着全世界的弱小民族，共同奮鬥，才有達到眞正解放和平等待遇的可能，所以這次的民族抗戰，安南的人民正熱烈的期望着我國抗戰得到最後的勝利。</p>
<p>安南的商業因爲法國限制外國資本流入，故其發達的速度甚緩，目下藩族還有一部以換物換物的買賣形式，可是都市交通較便的地方，普通商業都操在我們僑胞手中，比較其他的民族，實在佔　優越的地位，但通常輪入的貨物，大多數是法國的產物，我國的貨品輸到安南，實在少得可憐，僅佔到百分之一至二而巳，原因是法國對殖民地所採的「本國中心主義、」和英國對殖民地所採的「自由留易主義」有着極相反的不同，所以倘非必需的貨品，他們必定極端制到外貨輪入，因此我國貨品之銷行安南，乃爲　不足道，其餘各種大工業，　業，漁業等，亦皆操諸法人掌握，華人很少有投資機會。</p>
<p>我們僑胞在安南的救亡工作，尙可自由　動，一切籌軟募捐公偵各事，安南政府還未嘗有過干涉。</p>
<p>暹羅概況</p>
<p>還羅是世界著名的一個產米國，因爲天賦的土地肥沃和氣候適宜而獲得大量的生產，除　自　之外，大部盈餘還銷流了全世界，卽如我國南部數省，每年從暹羅辦入的米糧也就不少，出口物產除米佔第一位，次爲錫，再次爲木料，樹膠，鑛產，漁業，和其他的農作品，可是全暹羅的商業及經濟命脈，却是百分九十五操在我們華僑掌握裏，一切出口商，大小商店，統統是我們華人經營。商場鎖售的貨品劣貨竟估了百分之六十，我們的國貨僅佔百分之二十强，自從抗戰以後，僑胞着實醒悟了，上下實行杯葛仇貨的運動，給侵略者一個致命的打擊，藉此又可推進我們國貨的銷量，這算是一個可喜的現象，不過倭×在貿易减退之下，百般誘致，暹政府高築關稅壁　來排斥華貨，最近宣佈的修訂關稅條例，就是將華貨入口的稅率特別提高，作爲完全排斥華貨的初步。橫暴的壓力幷不能搖動僑胞愛國的熱情，表面雖然不能公開進行，暗裏推行的成績却愈宏大，同時一般熱血沸騰的靑年，又組織了鋤奸團和鐵血團，幹若神聖而不可侵犯的工作，雖然暹　當局很嚴厲的防患與拘捕，可是熱血的靑年還是勇往直前，不稍退縮，着實亦使無恥的漢奸和喪失靈魂的漢奸斂跡不迭，這　情形倭×恨不過，又逼迫暹維政府把我們的僑胞施行無理待遇，如去年第一次憑空拘捕了五千餘名安份的僑胞藉口烟犯而遣送囘國。第二次又拘捕了三千餘名備胞說是沒有隨身證而遣逐囘國，僑胞愈受到種種無理的虐待，他們愛國心却愈如烈火般的燃燒起來。我們在曼谷親耳聽見一個僑胞說：「祖國是我們的歸宿地方，我們在外間的地位自然亦隨着提高，否則，國家滅亡了，我們的一切亦隨着完了所以不愛國家的人是人麼一。這一席話是寄居在人籬下的僑胞座右銘，深願不是在暹維居留的僑胞，亦都能明白這層深意，出盡了個人所有的力量來保衛國家，國家强盛了，亦就保衛到我們寄居國外的華僑身上來，不然，還不是同猶太人一樣　？恐怕世界上是沒有亡國者立足的呵，何　暹　自從變政後，雖然表面是上下努力　朧國防，但　其內裏，亦不過徒有其表而巳，如果我們的國家抗戰勝利了，難保他不低首下來親近我們呢」</p>
<p>北馬概況</p>
<p>我們由暹羅跑進了北馬，首先考察了吉　，後來又砲過了威士利，此能，霹靂，而行抵雪蘭　，雖然足跡是　了好　次，但因這幾個地方都在英屬馬萊亞的範圍內，所以社會一切的動態也就相差無幾，不過，世界的不景氣影嚮到馬萊亞是不可避免的事實，有着沒有刈的　泥，停了活動的捋錫　和鐵船，佛郎，多產本來是對于消費者有利，但長供過于求，使價值低落，這是無政府生產狀態的錯誤。用　　的法了限制生產額，挽囘的低落價格，資本與地主的利潤可說沒有什麼損失，可是　苦了勞動者，得　工作的機會只有千分之　，餘的都是產業後，軍，餓着什皮叫苦，餓死確實是自由的，同時失業的，數激增人衆的購買力自然亦隨着低　，　景氣亦就難望恢復，一般勞動　生活情形愈更不學設想了，可是對于救亡的工作，勞動者却甚努力，實在極　欽　北馬教育雖然華人學校有相當發達，但爲着環境的關係，所謂戰時教育的精神簡直不能一見，至於華僑在此　的前途，我們實在　着　憂，原因就是過去經濟的發展已達最高度，且又有　牢不可設的帮派觀念稍得成績，却又默認滿足，且近年受到他人的巨大力量的襲擊，此後如不團結奮鬥，就只有沒落了。</p>
<p>末了　我們要　護領　抗戰到底加强民族　統一陳線，爭取最後的勝利！</p>

<p>今天是一百年前林則徐先生，在虎門焚燬菸土的紀念日。又恰當我國抗戰將屆兩年，世界上侵略狂潮，日見洶涌的時候。我們在今天紀念先哲，固然要增加禁菸救國與賢媲美的决心，尤不能不有鑑古立今，發奮自强的觀念。當前淸道光末年，淸庭內政腐收，國力弱小，因此印度的鴉片，遂投我國人民所好，大量運華。那時，林公就洞燭在先，知道鴉片　毒的禍害，以大無畏精神，毅然主禁，幷說：「此禍不除，則十年後無可用之兵，無可　之　，一當時朝　和今日國人，莫不佩其名論。百年以來，我國禁菸還沒澈底，暴×日本却因經過明治　新，和中日，日俄，歐戰各役，日趨兇强，定下了大陸政策，一貫不變的向我國侵略，步步進逼，先佔我東四省、不够，又侵我華北華中，華南，竟欲整個的滅亡我民族。我們知道：非抗戰不能救亡，而要貫澈抗戰必做的目的，非全民一致力行精神總動員不可，澈底肅淸菸毒，尤其是精神總動員中一椿最重大的項目，本來在×人侵略面具未揭穿以前，早己盡量的製造烈性毒品，如嗎啡，海洛因，紅白丸之類，或者派遣浪人，利用他的特殊勢力，到處走私運輸，或者竟然派遣他的奸商，在他有領事裁判權及日軍保護之下的地方，設立製造毒品工廠，大量生產，以圖毒化我國人民。這種事實，舉世盡知，自佔我廣大土地後，更是明目張胆，肆無忌憚，積極擴充毒化政策。凡是×兵所到之處，一切菸館和吸毒所，無不公然開設，甚至强逼我人民吸食。他的用心，無非要使我整個中華民族，全部變作烟民毒　，逼成一息奄奄，不惟沒有精神抵抗，而且　其死亡，　其傳種。須知我們要抗戰到底，爭取最後勝利，自非需要大量的兵員補充不可，如不把鴉片烟毒掃除盡净，怎樣能有大量的壯丁補充前綫？林公所說：「無可用之兵」一語，在當日海疆無事，還不過是安不忘危的預言，在今日全面戰爭中，更感覺到實際關係的重要。我在未抗戰以前，曾受中央特命，兼任禁烟總監一，辦理全國禁烟事宜，對於禁種禁運禁售禁吸和禁毒，早已手訂有最完密的計劃、定限民國二十九年底禁絕。年來因抗戰緊張，軍事　　，關於禁烟機構，雖然連同中央其他機關同時有所調整，但原來的用意，是在分別性質，使事務各專責成，實是加緊禁政的推進，幷非稍有放鬆。（中央社。明日待續）</p>

<h3 id="c15">到潼關去　七勇士之話 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>關，雄據陝　　三省交通要點，自古爲兵家爭戰之地；在當前西北抗戰的現勢下，其攻守得失，尤足影響大局可知。再說明白些，如果它能長久在我們掌握中，屹然不動，那末，控制　省，威脅豫東，聲投襄　，保衛西北，以及維擊西北國際路線諸問題，都可以「迎刃而解」「同奏膚功」，反之，若不幸而淪陷於×人鐵蹄之下，則西北戰局，必爲之改觀，將來大舉反攻時，亦必多一難題來作了。可是在事實上我英勇將士保衛潼關的戰績，眞是叫人高興，叫人崇敬！白北岸風陵度於去　失陷以來，×人萬丈兇燄，不斷向南岸潼關　突，經我英勇將士十四五個月之死守苦　，竟把潼關打成銅釘鐵柱深不可成的勝利基石了！</p>
<p>然而潼關這一勝利基石的結構，是怎樣的壯觀？她是如何施展她的偉力，以挽過去晉局旣倒之狂瀾，而作今後西北保衛之砥柱？所以我便帶着滿腹的高興和希望，從西京跳上東開的隴海車去作訪問。</p>
<p>東開特快客車，近來很少有空位了。因爲晉南和豫西鄰近戰區逃難來陜的老百姓，他們看見前方戰局轉佳，忽動思鄉之念，把兒女寄存陝西保胄院或視友處、又輕裝簡從地打囘家主義了、他們在　陽悶熱的天氣中，還穿着老棉襖的樣實農民，有的會貧望着消河兩岸迎風起伏的麥浪，獨個兒　出了一絲二　闊別已久的笑容。不管是否在聯想他地里的麥子，大概也這樣成熟　一點一點的歡迎他回去收獲；抑或在想象歸家時有肉團　的樂趣；在回憶某次親見空戰打下×機的高興——總之，一斯人而有斯笑也」其動機必與閔囘家問題」多少有點關聯。囘家問題在現階段的四億七千萬同胞心目中，的確是個有普遍性的嚴重問題，尤其我東北，華北，東南一切失陷區的同跑，在前線　戰及內地流亡的，固然念茲在茲地要打囘老家去；卽在失陷區忍氣吞聲過　非人生活的，亦何　不希望我們趕决打囘華北，東南，東北老家去，以恢復他體固有安樂自由的生活。是時候了，大家趕緊努力加油，則打囘老家去的美麗的勝利之花，便會很快的開放在每一個人和樂的面孔之上了！</p>
<p>另有七位榮　傷兵，不，他，是傷愈重，上前線的英勇兵員，年齡均在二十上下，精神甚爲健旺，一路談笑風生，亦頗有『欣然如歸故鄉』之概。問他們怎麼會有這高興？從他們七嘴八舌的答語中，曉得他們內有五人是川籍，當他們追　高興原因時，其談叶之流利詼諧，很有古蜀名士秦　談天的流風餘韻，竟使大家聽得眉飛色　，笑逐顏開，而不知車行之所之。</p>
<p>有的說：我們前年從四川出發時，已經是初冬季節了可是每人祗穿單衣　一套，每二人共用軍灰毯一條，有時　得渾身發抖，到宜昌　見湖北壯丁穿着又新又厚的棉衣，向同方向出發，我們迎着朔風更加　胸昂首地定起來，尤其赤脚的更用力將兩片脚板地作響，以示四川壯丁精神之特出。後來開到冰天雪地的山西去作戰，卒因裝備差池，吃了些意外的虧，當然精神也蒙受相當的打擊。哦！可是鏖戰到了去年，以及今春，我們的裝備和新武器，竟愈來愈　美了；×人的飛機坦克車也常遇了「對頭親家」，而不敢耀武揚威橫行無忌了。……我們負傷就　已兩月多，現在重上前線，當然又要得看些我們更進步的新花樣——說不定此次出擊便得追倒×人「溝子」（川語指臀部）一氣把牠趕出去—這樣值得高興的事而不高興那不是成了漢奸？』</p>
<p>有的說：『我們這幾位同志的命，可算一條抵幾條，因爲先後帶傷幾次，都不會死掉醫如我，就帶傷過四次，每次下來醫治，吃喝醫院，就等於拿雙糧雙餉一樣。傷愈歸隊，又得照原級提升一級。我前次剛由二等兵升到上士，這次又傷愈歸隊，總得弄排把人指揮了；手上有排把人指揮，若遇着連把×人對　，不拘白天去「　」，夜晚去「摸」，都願意把幾次白拾得的性命，帶着弟兄們冒百死去建立以少勝多的奇勛，這是何等光榮的一件痛快事！』</p>
<p>有幾位，却自述他們掛彩時的激　戰情，如云：他們在××地繼續作激烈戰到一星期，最後兩天飯送不上去，直餓得肚子怪叫，且精神疲倦已極只要×方槍聲稍停止，有的便靠着戰壕昏昏入睡了；可是徵聞警戒之聲，把滿佈着血的眼睛只消用力一睜，一個個又虎視耽耽的和×人大幹起來了！</p>
<p>如云：中條山××村肉搏戰他們七人中的就位戰士，被竹根截穿膠鞋，幷傷足而絆倒於地，一×兵乘機舉槍刺來，戰士自料必死，詛知槍刺將及胸部的一剎那間，該×兵　被另一×兵　中其後背心，「餓狗撲食一似的先行　地，他連一再會」都趕不上說一句，便很安詳地去一我四川酆都（俗指陰府）遊要一去了—另一×兵，他是否企圖反正的東北偽軍，因當時第二道×線見情况不利，開槍掃射，不曾認識淸楚；但以近來各戰場偽軍反正層出不窮的事實證之，斷定他準是個有覺悟和機警心的　軍。</p>
<p>如云：晉×被我神出鬼沒的各部英勇將士不斷予以打擊，弄得啞子吃黃連有苦說不出，竟變本加厲而不惜施用各種卑鄙陰毒的手段；例如：向村民問路討火之　，要　深地作上　個揖；遇着態度不明的組槍會一　組織的人更卑躬屈節地向他們敬禮，暗地主使蒙偽軍殘殺我正氣不阿的老百姓，表面上又于臨刑之前當衆出來講個貓哭老鼠般的假人情；尤其到處賞格佈吿，妄想嗾使無知同胞，捕殺我愛國健兒，謂能捕殺我××軍一人者　洋二十元，捕殺第×軍一人者賞洋卅元，捕殺×路軍一人者賞洋五十元。這　手段雖很陰毒，但在實際上，除暴露其癩蛤蟆想吃天鵝肉的妄想以外，不過　日本人自己多　　幅小氣汗　的醜像而已—因爲在目前我軍民精誠團結生死相共的情勢下，日本人縱大慷其概地增出賞格至數百元，或數千元，但請放心，如此也絕不會有人肯捕殺任何一部分的愛國健兒，向××嘴里剝果子似的而向日本人去請賞！</p>
<p>——那七位榮譽戰士，這樣如數家珍一般的講着他們光榮的戰績，×人的種種陰謀和　行，使我們好似諦聽希臘時代的行吟詩人歌誦往古的英雄一般；不過更偉大的，他們自己就是這歌頌的創作者，而這歌詞中所描述的又是他們　身經　的勛積。聽者真使人悠然神往，不知車行之所之。</p>
<p>機車上的抑火，繼續着西山落日而執行了任務，它那雷電般閃爍的光芒，不斷把一幢幢的黑　往後　送過去，可是經過了××後，它忽然小心　翼地收斂了光芒，而每一個東廂中的燈火，也亦步亦　地跟着熄　了。乘客們也、不約而同的　　吸氣起來。各自咀嚼夜行軍的「　枚冀走」之滋味。唯有　　　尾不怕艱險的游龍般的列車，依然歷制不住它那　　前進的　　怒聲：車行發出如此超越常態的進行曲無異在告訴我們說：這是不得不如此的小心的；否則就會賜給咫尺艦的　人射擊目標！—同時也好　在宜布說：目的地——關，也已安然聞過了！爲什麼要闖過？因爲那里太念險，能不到××安全地停車下人呀！</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c18">莫洛托夫外交演說以後 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>莫洛托夫就任蘇聯外長以來的第一次總合表示的演說發表以後，對於歐洲及遠東方面，皆引起了各方面的影響。此後國際情勢預料當有更高一層的發展。莫洛托夫的演說內容，大體上可以分成兩方面，一是關於英蘇法三國互助協定的意見，一是對遠東侵略者的答復。但這兩方面聯結起來看，却可以說是反侵略陣綫整個的問題。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫的演說中最重要的部分是：對英法組織和平陣線的誠意表示懷疑。莫氏稱：「英法所提「反抗納粹及法西斯侵略」的三角互助協定，其中因有種種限制的條件，所以徒然使協定不能發生效力」。莫氏還指摘：「民主國家對世界情勢的變遷估計過低，不但放棄集體安全，並且嘗試讓步的政策；這兩種觀點都是蘇聯所反對的」。莫氏的演說對英法的猶豫態度，實在一針見血。在反侵略陣線需要即刻成立的今日，賓有充分的必要。蘇聯的實在要求，也很簡單，正如莫氏所言：蘇聯政府堅持該公約須純爲防禦性質，並保證蘇聯各鄰邦訂立具體協定，遇簽字國之一遭受攻擊時，則其他簽字國實行援助。</p>
<p>然自莫氏演說發表後，歐洲方面的反響，目大體上看，是可樂觀的。莫氏對英蘇法三角協定草案。認爲不能滿意者有兩點：其一是對抗侵略時須經國聯决議：其二被保證國家未包括波羅的海三小國。這兩點意見，在英國方面認爲只是形式的不同而不是實質的不同。關於前一點。相信英國也不至于堅持原意：關于後一點，也不難找到圓滿解决：因爲波羅的海諸小國也正需要這種保證。另一方面，卽與這個互助協定有密切關係的國家如法美，皆不約而同地主張英國應該讓步，　巴黎電，昨日巴黎官方層與英大使舉行會議，討論英蘇法三國協定問題時，法外長龐萊曾促英大使轉達英政府，對蘇外長將保證國家擴大至波羅的海各國的要求。加以折衷的接納，或如聯蘇不肯讓步時完全加以接納。在目前成為最大阻礙的，只是這一點。倫敦政府中人對咨詢國聯一點已表示可無嚴重之分歧，只對於波羅的海國家的保證問題，尚以「在法理上不應强迫不願接受保證的國家接受保證」爲理由，表示難色。但若英國能聽從法國的忠吿，接納蘇聯的要求，則三國互助協定自不難早日實現。卽美國國務院也抱樂觀，据接近白宮的某要人的推測，英蘇締結同盟條約，縱有顧忌，但愛好和平的各國此際仍受着嚴重的威脅，英國當會權衡利害，當機立斷。我們相信當此德意侵略加緊團結的今日，英國政府當不會違背民意而使三國協定再度擱淺罷！</p>
<p>莫氏的演說，還有一個要點，是關于遠東的問題。莫氏特別關懷中國的抗戰，他強調史塔林關於援助被侵略及為國家獨立而奪門的國家所發表的宣言，現在正完全適用於中國，「吾人正時常執行這種政策」。日本最近又為移轉國內外的視聽而施其欺騙手段，向蘇聯及外蒙挑戰，並擴大其宣傳。但在蘇聯方面則認為「不能容忍」，并將保護外蒙。這裏可特別注意的一點，就是：當此日本侵略者欲籍向蘇聯挑戰以緩和其與英法的衝突的今日，蘇聯當必格外重視遠東問題。莫洛托夫在其演說中，把遠東問題與歐洲問題相提並論，說：「此事與蘇聯在歐洲方面欲聯絡和平國家成立一共同陣綫以抗拒侵略的工作完全相合」。因此美國國務院左右人推斷：蘇聯不愿接受英法草案的關鍵在遠東方面。美國最近愈有加強遠東政策的傾向，自然也希望着蘇聯的這種提示，能得到英法的接受。吾人對於這一點，是熱烈地希望英法更深刻地考慮這一句話：「世界的和平是不可分的」；日本之佯犯蘇聯只是一種外交及內政的策略罷了！</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>利園袖海堂是一個美的好去處；可是，出席的賓客却異口同聲說：「路是不容易走的。」歇一歇，很舒服地休息一會，才開始小組式的歡叙。</p>
<p>本報電影戲劇周刊主開的電影戲劇座談會，今次是第三　了，我們很感謝蒞臨參加的戲劇先進們，和朋友們。</p>
<p>佳賓除「中救」全體團員外，戲劇界有歐陽予倩，　衍，唐叔明、張雪峯，及唐槐秋代表　家寶等：電影界有羅靜予，他，還兼做　楚生等的代表，因爲蔡先生等正忙若拍片呢！畫家有張正宇，張光宇，丁　。作家有馬國亮。還有很多位是戲劇界文化界和新聞界的朋友。濟濟一堂，共有五十多人。轟動全港的『中救』公演就作爲大家談話的中心，座中有「中救」朋友，從每個不同的臉孔，使人喚起舞台上的囘憶，這個啞吧，那個老先生……刮目相看，是　有意趣的見到真面目，談談笑笑，空氣十分融洽。</p>
<p>昨天下午過了三時，主席陸浮先生首先簡略地設明「中救」十一來所給予新與救亡劇　的影響。從中救的嚴　而苦幹的工作精神；說到中救的澈底的為抗戰宣傳爲新興戲劇開拓了新的基礎的工作目標。尤特別開場中救二十個月的工作方式，說出他們七百多次的演出，是怎樣利用一切可能的方法去　召見衆，怎樣深入到廣大的農民士兵的階層，同時更鄭重地說出他們在香港爲各界賑聯會的第七四二次的大規模義演，和爲招待香港民衆學生的七四三次宣傳大公演，那精湛宏偉的從先生活血淋淋的現實通過集體的理解與高度技術的偉大演出，更空前的擴展了戲劇感效與影響的領域，空前，予香港救亡劇運以嚴　猛列的刺　、希望在座的各位先進對這一次的演出能給予進步的　討和鼓勵，使香港的戲劇工作者怎樣去接受他們寶貴的經騐與教訓，最後，就提出這次座談會的討論范圍，一，「中救」在港演出的意義與影，——演出的重大意義，給予般　衆的影響，留港戲據工作者應有的反應，二，演技，舞台技術，其　，三，救亡劇運的展　——什麼是救亡劇運的基礎？救亡劇運的意識與形態，救亡劇運的形式與內容，劇人今後應有的力……</p>
<p>大家都熱烈烈予無限希望的歐陽予倩先生，在掌　中首先發言：『嚴肅，擊齊，熱情，親切』包括了中救　全貌：苦幹的精神，嚴密的組織，是很難得的。演　的成功固不消說。天幕的美，在香港却是破天　第　次。語重心長地運希望香港靑年戲劇工作者要有嚴密的組織，讓熱情與活力好好地發展起來。雖然物質條件困難。亦要在困難的環境中生長着。</p>
<p>衍先生發言的時候，大家都特別注意。中救的演出，分明是不可多得的。所有的批評，都是根據事實予以　維，贊揚。夏先生呢，却來一個嚴格的批判，愛之深，望之切，中救朋友很感謝好意的指示，大家亦感　夏先生說話的深刻與嚴格。</p>
<p>羅靜　先生先說在武漢與中救合拍電影的經過，再說他這次在觀「保衛視國的時候，亦跟周　的觀衆一　掉　眼淚。希望中救再從　　方面多所努力。這位年靑的中國電影製片廠主人，還稱贊中救是「美麗而樸實」，這，是很恰切的評語。</p>
<p>中旅導演張雪峯先生發言，關於舞台裝置的話特別生動，有手對，有表情使人很盛興趣。只有他，說的是廣州話。中救朋友趁此學習方言，一個個都張着嘴巴地凝神着。尤其是　子英君的神氣更是十足。</p>
<p>馬國亮先生說中救演出最有意義的地方是通過了戲劇，劇場作爲熱烈，緊張的民眾大會了。這是抗戰二年來，香港未　有過的好現乘。——這一點，亦是實在的話。</p>
<p>需家張光宇先生說，用書畫的眼光看中救演出的裝置，燈光，都很美。同行們亦同樣稱贊過。丁　先生說沒有話，只有一點點，這一點點亦補充得好。引起大家　然大笑。</p>
<p>黃慶華先生說，他訪問過工人觀衆一。中救感人至深，演出是成功的。</p>
<p>金山先生發言，「沙沙」的聲音還未恢復，他很感謝這個嚴肅而誠　的座談會，王　，林樞二位，對于各方面幫忙的朋友表示感謝。</p>
<p>劈頭說話是歐陽先生，殿後說話還是歐　先生，他鄭　地說，中救能够這樣已經是難能可貴了，「我們大家要互相學習，不怕有錯怏，只要認錯，收正，求進步，」這是　動人的警句，</p>
<p>願大家記住歐　先生　是這般虛心，學習歐陽先生的求知精神</p>
<p>主席致　感謝之後，吃吃「美麗而　實」的茶點，　影留念，祝大家永遠地　愛，相互的學習，站在一起來迎接偉大的時代。</p>

<p>— 郁瑯</p>
<p>棒着紙　牌去「買水」給死人洗臉；父母之喪，兒子也要寫幅什麼『劬勞未報』『昊天罔極』的祭輓；囘魂，……都是古禮所無。俗人市懀附會妄做的事。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我可以把筆頭一轉說說喪的本身、——</p>
<p>但凡在家身死的，都是由執業西醫生簽寫證明書，向衛生局生死註冊處註了冊領了註冊證然後可以埋雜。</p>
<p>埋葬的墳場都是指定的，從灣仔大原街以西，包括中環，上環，西營盤，的居民，如有喪事，都要葬在鷄籠環公衆墳場，大原街以東包括灣仔，銅　　　箕　，的民居，如有喪事都要葬咖啡園或柴灣墳場。九龍方面有九龍讀場。</p>
<p>這種墳場是一級一級，沿繞着山坵開掘慕地，每個墓地相　不及三尺，遠望好像戲院的座位。生時住在香港是人多地狹；死在香港也人擠地　的！</p>
<p>山地分五毫，一元，三元，五元幾種，　着地段號數去葬，沒有選揮，在這種的環境下，風水觀念全打消。</p>
<p>這種墳場的山墳沒有什麼墳堆，更沒有什麼羅穴，『靑龍』『白虎』；富有利用三合土作成一個長方平面的拜台，上面樹立一個碑，半中不西地算做墓便了。　人祗在平地上樹立一個尺來高的短碣，後面樹立一塊地段號數的刻石便算，雜　生長。往往　沒了，無從找認。</p>
<p>除了公衆墳場外，富人可以葬在香港仔的「永遠墳場」，這墳場的山地較爲廣闊，　築較好，費用每號山地要三十多元，牠是「永遠」的不像公衆墳場限定落葬七年後要起拾骸骨遷　。</p>
<p>各宗教有他們專葬教友的墳場。</p>
<p>在醫院身死的，都在殮房傍的壙場做喪事，醫院沒有建築好的場所，給人做喪事的。最令人不滿的却是僕役們藉端索錢；譬如喪家請喃無佬念經，他們要素焚燒其鏹錢等等……不勝舉出。</p>
<p>至於喪的主要物——棺材；價錢沒有一定，薄棺十洋八塊有一口，中等的五六十塊，至到什麼汀洲沙板，沉香，……等貴重的木料，一二千洋很平常，牠比一部一九三九年新型汽車還貴呢—</p>
<p>洋裝棺材近年很流行，價錢不見得平，最普通的要百多元，說到什麼　棺，却要三二千元，一般人不易有這樣福命。</p>
<p>無貴無賤同爲枯骨，死本來是最平等的事，不過死的儀式幷不平等，「有錢三十爲尊長無錢八十少年亡」一語，是　刺喪的儀式而發。</p>

<p>友碑初出而勝西洋會、再戰而克岷甸奴、遂一國有勁旅之稱、該隊原係去屆平平無奇的義勇軍的變相、祇因邇來勤於練習、各偭技術大有進步、故能兩戰皆捷、變爲將來爭標的有力一份子、</p>
<p>香港會則有好手多名加入、陣容亦煥然一新、觀於月前該隊力戰中華隊一役，結果雖遭敗續、但其給予中華的威脅甚大、在第五局的時候、尤以六比四佔先勝、祗因後勁不繼、遂陷于崩潰狀態中、致被中華攫得最後勝利、然而、該隊仍不失爲雄師、其充厚的戰鬥力、足與任何一隊相週旋、</p>
<p>今天友啤異香港會對壘、多數人會預測友啤必勝、但我則未敢先加斷語、因友啤旣有半斤、香港會亦有八兩、而且香港會各員的擊球術、比對方亦未嘗孫色、惟防守聯絡似不及對方縝密而已、</p>
<p>苛香港會各員對於防守方面注意一點、减少錯誤、便會使對方有不　登壘之感</p>
<p>投手爲一隊的靈魂、如得一投手有良好功夫的、則該隊所抱獲勝希望較高、友碑投手夏高理、功夫很不錯、但不能作持久戰、在第四五局以後、他的投球力便感軟化了、香港會投手羅蘭士、亦有此　、惟其技術似不及夏高理之獨到、故此、友碑的勝利較有把握、</p>
<p>但棒球作戰的勝利機搆、尙不以一個投手爲關鍵、最重要的則爲全隊的合作、若其合作得法、聯絡一致、則去勝利條件不遠了、</p>
<p>香港會的聯絡、照看不及友碑之隹、但角逐起來、誰也難保不無錯誤，　友啤稍有不愼、而予人以隙、則會演出意外之結果、亦非奇事、總之、此役是値得一觀的並錄雙方球員如下、（</p>

<p>— 張德昌</p>
<p>當時各國政府以借款，補助金的方式來維持小農，發展合作事業使小　不受中間人的剝削。德國俄國更大規模政革土地現狀。用鐵路廉運政策便捷農產品的分配。用關稅政策來保陣農村，甚至美國，一個農產豐富國家，也採用政治方法來抵制加拿大農產品的侵入。在工業方面，政府規定各種法律限制工業合併，保障工業工人，訓練無技術的工人，提高生產能力，國家不只消極的管理，且漸漸的有政府與辦的工業，最初與辦的如軍火廠。以及其他與戰爭有關的工業。鐵道機廠在國有鐵路國家也自然是國營的，有些工業國家辦理，但又用補助津貼的方法，使私人資本與創，國家可以管理。如俄國的鋼鐵業是在政府重金貼的有利條件下開創的。德國的造船業也是政府用政治方式助其成功的。至於交通事業，和國家關係為尤直接有關，在鐵路私有的國家中，英法等國政府逐漸的獲得管制權力。一切經濟事業，資本組織而外，技術佔重要的地位。如果專戀私人去研究私人工廠商店個別的訓練工人，範圍影響是很小的，十九世紀以來的國家在這方面盡了很大的任務。研究的機關，敎育的機關一大半是政府設立，或是予以方便。我們可以說沒有十九世紀以來政治干涉經濟事業的種種作爲，近代經濟事業不會有今日之發展所以十九世紀來國家與經濟事業的關係最密切。政治干涉經濟事業的權力　加，範圍擴大。是近代統制經濟，計劃經濟發生的第一個基礎。</p>
<p>歐洲大戰打了四年的仗，對於國家管理經濟事業更進一步，開了一個新局面。在歐戰期間交戰國的雙方都嚴格的統制經事業，共詳情不必贅述。我們只簡單說明兩點。第一，在這四年大戰中，政府支配經濟事業的織權擴展到最大限度。英國戰時內閣的報吿中有一段說：『最大多數的人都直接間接爲公共而服務。軍士官吏而外，有的人從事農作，有的從事製造，其他的人盡職於組織，轉　及分配事業。所有生產機關都被政府由私人手裏接收過來。鐵道航運，煤鐵，工程製造以及原料食粮柴炭等等。政府不但要免責籌足，且免責管理使個人國家兩得其便。政府還要管理物價，抑止過分利潤；管制　費，規定最高物價，統理出入口貿易。總之，舉凡消費生產以及有關事業都使政府第一次做統制嘗試，因爲這個戰爭，使國家之社會，行政組織起一大變化。許多的變化中有許多是以後不能更易的。』政府旣管理各　經濟事業，戰前的政府組總是不足以應付此重大責任的，所以第二點我們要注意的是隨政府職權之擴大而將組織擴大。英國在戰時政府聘僱的大小人員在二十三萬以上。各交戰國情形也是一樣。政府第一次擊爲最大僱主。這四年的設施，雖是戰時情形，但留了　深的印象在人心裏。國家統制經濟事業已有幾年的實際經騐，達到最有效，最合理的結果。說明了經濟事業應當在國家一個政府之下通　籌劃，這是近代統制經濟，計劃經濟的第二個基礎。</p>
<p>近代統制經濟，計劃經濟的思潮，本此基礎作爲先例，以求建設新的經濟制代替私人經　制度。他們的理論我們這裏不必提。不過有兩點我們要提出：一，在一政府下有一個全盤的計劃：二，改變，擴大政府的組織，執行這個計劃。以現在政府的組織不能祖繁重的責任。</p>
<p>以政治力量管理經濟事業，到了現在成了巳成的趨勢。不過對於一個已有工業基礎的國家和一個未工梁化的國家，問題的件質不同。對於前者，最重要的問題是如何把私人生產事業轉移於國家之手。在這些國家裏，工商家，地主已有根深蒂固的勢力。社會的阻力是很大的。不過就在這種國家，也可以用和平的方法達到國營的目的。對於一個工業落後的國家。問題便簡單得多。比如中國並沒有大的工商業勢力。唯一繁重的問題是土地問題。在其他方而，沒有任何私人的經濟力量大過政府，政府是最大的資本家，也是最大的僱主。同時也只有政府是最大收羅技術人材機關，訓練技術機關。用政治力量發展經濟事業要容易得多，便捷得多。無論在戰時及戰後，中國的工業問題須取决於資本及技術問題的解决，說到資本及技術，除了政府外，有那一個私人力量可與並論呢。</p>

<p>湘西的婦女，比較中國各地的婦女都要特別，她們百分之九十都是勞動婦女，無論在　作方面，家　方面，她們比男子負担兩倍以上的勞作；拿沅陵一地來說，這種例子就更顯著了。陵大約有五分之一以上的男人是抽大煙的，他們什麼都不管，整天坐在家具，一切家計，生產，都讓女人來支持，只在心境不好，或是嫌物質供給不滿足的時候，便向妻子或女兒大駡；此外唯一的事情就是到茶館裏去談天</p>
<p>女人們呢，從七八歲起，就訓練爬山的本領，兩肩背上了一只尺把高的「字紙簍」似的回籮，一步一步的上上落落，這樣一直訓練到衰老，再不能背重的時候，才和背籮脫離了關係。</p>
<p>背籮的用途很多。通常用來背柴，負米，甚至背負較重的箱子和包裏；她們經常替商店運貨，替客人們搬行李，三四十斤的東西擱在背籮上，在她們是很輕鬆的。此外背籮還有一個主要的用途，就是把還不能行走的孩子放在籮裏，帶他上山下田。在　苦工作的當兒，孩子底搖拽的小手，甜蜜而稚嫩的聲音，倒能給母親以無限的安慰呢。</p>
<p>女人們底體格，大都結實强壯，膚色　糙而略帶焦黄，是的，她們除了天天受太陽風雨的　撻之外，還得受生育的摧殘和丈夫與家庭所給予的種種虐待，</p>
<p>每一個外地人初到沅陵的時候，都會這樣想；「婦女旣是每個人都能生產，她在家庭的地位一定很高了。」但事實吿訴我們並不這樣。一個女孩子出世以後。就在冷落與輕視下慢慢地生長，等到她能够穩定地行走和爬高的時候，背籮便開始牢牢地和她結下了很深的關係。背籮彷彿就是她們底命運。—她們底不能解脫的痛苦的命運。往後按着她們底年齡，和家庭生活狀　來决定勞動力的增滅；成長之後，眼各地封建勢力壓迫下的女子一樣。給家長們半買賣式嫁了出去，此後，她們負担更重的勞作和　更受更多複雜的精神上的痛苦了。</p>
<p>湘西婦女有機會受敎育的，一百人中平均不到一二人，所以可以說她們完全沒有受敎育。那原因第一當然因爲湘西人民一般地貧困，不容易供給兒女進學校請書，第二因爲輕視女孩子，深中「女子無才便是德」的毒，婦女們的求知機會，也就完全被剝奪了。</p>
<p>不能讓女子有知識，不能讓她們知道這社會，也不能讓她們知道人類。如果她們懂得了一切，她們還能忍受那封建勢力的架鋇跐？……中國的女子就在這種聰明的統治方法下權牲了無限的生命和精力，湘西的勞動婦女們更在　重的迫害下　續犧性着，這是一榕多　　人痛心的事情呵！</p>
<p>婦女解放運動的工作者們，動員民衆的工作者們，憲該切實地注意這個問題，好好地把中國婦女底力量引導到抗戰總的力量裏面去。</p>
<p>……解脫掉湘西婦女們底痛苦的命運　，把她們背上的不合理的重負卸下來吧。她們結實的身體還要背重，但所背的並不是封建的殘暴壓力，而是抗戰的中華民族每個人民共同悲　命遝啊</p>
<p>（三）一個例子</p>
<p>湘西在國防的意義上旣是那樣重要，但是人民生活是那樣地困苦，文化又那樣低落，這些都是全面抗戰中很嚴重的問題。如果要促進抗戰勝利，那麼，怎樣改良人民生活和怎樣推動民衆動員工作就成爲最迫切的需要了。城西土地廟內的那對老人，我想這是我們反省的最好的例子。……</p>
<p>西門外，從大街轉入馬坊界一直往山上跑，到半山麼，便看見一間　躱在路旁的土地廟，它是那麽古舊和灰暗，兩旁堆着灰和義，沒人上香，也沒什麽字跡，直是一塊被人忘記得一乾二凈的卑污的地方。</p>
<p>和那所小古廟發生了友誼，不能一天的離開的，只有一對七十歲以上的老叫化子，他們居住在那裏，據說巴經有十幾年了。在見方四尺寬闊的土地廟前面，老叫化子各佔據了一個舖位，所以路人走過的時候，特別覺得這塊地方狹小……而且，在春天，老人們底舖位發散出一股霉臭的氣味，冬天，他們又燃燒起到處檢來的垃圾和　草，左右五軍都嗅得到那股焦臭的氣息。……</p>
<p>因爲每犬辦公，我都要經過那所土地　，那倆位被人　擯棄的老人，老是躺在齷齪得難以形容的舖位上鴿子似地呻吟着；他們　臉面豫剛從地下發掘出來的古代陶器，灰　的頭髪與五官簡直混在一起了。</p>
<p>「你們是本地人　？」有一天，我問其中的男的說。</p>
<p>老人注視我如一會，才點一點頭。</p>
<p>「她是你底女人嗎」？我蹲下來指　那老女人說。她正臉向着　，一面呻吟，一面忍着寒冷抽噎着。</p>
<p>「不是」。老人回答我說。</p>
<p>可是到我追問他的時候，他狡猾地道：</p>
<p>一總之她是我底女人就是了，她是我底什麽人，我倒忘記了」，他掉歪頭問那老女人說：「喂，你是比我小八歲嗎？」</p>
<p>那老女人不耐煩地，仍把臉　墻壁，說：</p>
<p>「唔，我比你少挨八個冷天就是，我不知道什麼叫一歲」！</p>
<p>老人不響，又低頭弄那些焦臭的　料，我怕那老女人生氣不敢跟她搭嘴，於是又悄悄問那位老人說：</p>
<p>「唉！敵人底飛機這沒到過沅陵吧？一他没答應我，我又繼續問他：</p>
<p>「你恨日本人？他把我們千千萬萬人趕得　　失所！」</p>
<p>什麼×人底飛機？什麽日本人？先生，你是　兒來的呢？—你問我這些事做什麽？我什麼都不知道，只是半年來沅陵來了許多外地人，而且嗚嗚的汽笛一響時，他們愛急地朝山頂跑。世界有點夢了，從前沒有那許多人，難道外面有些什麽災難？强盜都把人們趕到這兒來嗎？」　（未完）</p>

<p>— 藍洪</p>
<p>抗戰以來的作品所以會一千篇一律」，據理論家的分析是由於作者生活的不深入。我想，這說法該是不錯的，但另一面，讀者還有嫌於作品技巧的幼穉。生活的不安定，寫作時間的短促，自然可以是一種理由，然而，我們却不應自滿於這種理由，除非是不想進步。</p>
<p>同一的題村，可以產生樣式不同的作品，這正是作爲蘇　之一的文學的特色。寫作不是公式的，正相反，而是無比的多樣性的，公式主義的形成是拙劣的作老的罪過，內容的空洞，需以生活的深入來補救；技巧的幼穉，則待於學習和敎養，藝術的。一個優秀的作者，用他的一枝彩色的藝術筆描繪動人的故事，有他自己獨特的風。</p>
<p>作品評價的高下，大抵以內容如何爲標準——祗少輓近的論者是着眼於此的。站在歷史的立場上，站在現實的立場上，對於這一個標準我們都無力與以否定。旣使有人不以爲然，也祗能慨歎的說，這是一種無可奈何的存在。對於時代洪流的抗拒，歸結必遭滅頂之殃。藝術的良心，必然地伴隨羞一種無可違逆的前提，就是對於時代的忠貞。該不至於有人提出異　吧</p>
<p>爲了更明確地反映內容，爲了有感人的力量，也就是爲了達到藝術的目的——藝術該是有目的吧？正如人家所說的：「人類的一切事業，要使他不變成空虛的，無用的東西，就非服務於人類的利益不可。」所以，我們需要熱練的寫作技巧。我們不是形式主義者，不是技巧至上主義者，也深知華麗的燕尾服穿在　的身上仍掩飾不了醜　。但針對着眼前的現象，却覺得有提醒每一個作者對於技巧學習的努力的必要。因爲文學是藝術而非別的。</p>
<p>但，應該聲明的，所謂技巧並不是艷　字眼的　砌。漂亮辭藻的積累。文學並非文字　　，字面上的功夫是不　錢的。生動的形象的描寫是活的。人物的刻劃，環境的表現，霧圍的描寫……决非掉弄幾個辭藻我可成功的。因此我們要時時使用自己的觀察力和發展自己的想條力。所以按巧的學習主要地雖　閱讀文學巨匠的著作，但與生活仍是有係的。</p>
<p>有人說：「寫作也是一個生活實踐的問題」。原因大約就在此吧。</p>

<p>據老於航海的人說，海鷗在汪洋大海中，一看見船見，就要拼命的追趕，追趕不到，中途又沒有立足休息的地方，牠就只好墜海而死。</p>
<p>老於航海的人如此說，一般盲目崇拜英雄的人，尤其詩人們，就都稱頌海鷗，說牠眞是勇敢，爲了一定要達到牠的目的，便不怕犧性：人們要是也有牠那樣的勇敢，世界就會更加進步了。</p>
<p>我却不以爲然：海鷗的舉動只是一股蠻勁，非但不勇敢，並旦愚蠢的。牠看見了船要追，我就看不出牠有什麼正當的目的來。也許牠想船上會給牠一些慰勞：可是船上是不理牠的。也許牠在桅子頂上可以得到一些休息，可是船上立刻就要逐去牠的。也許牠想向船上表示一些威脅的意味，可是船上要答覆牠的，是一陣槍彈。徒勞無功，有罰無賞，這不是愚蠢是什麽。</p>
<p>至於追不到船，因此力竭而死，那我們除了其愚不可及也，一句話之外，簡直找不出第二句話來說牠。</p>
<p>原來鳶飛戾天，魚躍于淵，天地很大，大家都很自由自在的。船不妨礙海鷗，海鷗正也不必妨礙船。海鷗若要逞強，也不過自取滅亡罷了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Soviet Union Reaffirms Foreign Policy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Jiansheng</p>
<p>On the evening of May 31st, Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov delivered an important speech in the parliament regarding the Soviet Union's attitude towards the current international situation, providing a very frank explanation. It will undoubtedly have a significant impact on future international developments and China's war of resistance, which is something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Firstly, Molotov reiterated the Soviet Union's foreign policy as reported by the Soviet Union's highest leader Stalin at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March, specifically solemnly declaring the "resolute opposition to aggressors" and the "resolute assistance to invaded countries fighting for national independence." Molotov first severely condemned the recent provocations and conspiracies by the Japanese puppet troops against Outer Mongolia, and seriously warned Japan, saying: "The Soviet Union's determination to protect the borders of Outer Mongolia is as firm as its determination to protect its own borders... Our patience also has its limits. If the Japanese and 'Manchukuo' authorities are aware of the times, they should promptly cease their incessant intrusions into the Soviet-Mongolian border!" Molotov then solemnly stated: "You are certainly aware that Stalin's statement is about assisting invaded countries fighting for national independence. This statement is fully applicable to China, which is fighting for national independence. We have been constantly implementing this policy in practice, and it is also fully in line with the principle of the Soviet Union organizing a united front of peace-loving countries against aggression in Europe. We do not want to place excessive or special trust in this declaration by the Soviet diplomatic authorities, but we cannot but recognize that this declaration by the Soviet diplomatic authorities is distinctly different from that of other capitalist countries, especially fascist aggressor countries. This lies in the development of the Soviet national economy, the strengthening of national defense, the complete unity and cooperation from top to bottom, and the increasing international credibility, that is, the consolidation and development of the political and material strength of the socialist spirit and morality, which have become a guarantee for this declaration. Therefore, we can predict that the provocations of the Japanese puppet troops against Outer Mongolia will suffer an even greater blow than the Zhanggufeng Incident last year and expose their ugliness; and the active progress of Soviet aid to China will be more than just containing the Japanese puppet troops stretching for thousands of miles along the border between Puppet Manchukuo and Inner Mongolia! From our country's standpoint, in addition to rejoicing and gratitude for this clear and enthusiastic expression from the Soviet Union, we should redouble our efforts to promote the cause of cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union for democracy and peace, and strive to urge Britain, the United States, and France to work together in this great and sacred cause, in order to jointly resist the enemies of democracy, peace, and human civilization—the fascist aggressors!"</p>
<p>Secondly, in response to the joint proposal by Britain and France to conclude a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Molotov reiterated the clear and firm position of the Soviet Union on this matter. We have repeatedly pointed out the errors in the subjective speculation made by the general public about this negotiation, and pointed out that both the empty optimists and the malicious doomsayers have exceeded the facts, because the financial capitalists of Britain and France have not placed the interests of their country, nation, and world peace above their private class interests, nor have they thoroughly realized the great significance of completely abandoning the "half-hearted policy" at present. Therefore, in the recent joint proposal to the Soviet Union, in addition to the significance of demonstrating to the aggressors and alleviating the anti- ×× sentiment at home, it still lacks the basic elements for actively and effectively completing the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and the anti-aggression front. Moreover, the delay in time has given the aggressors an opportunity to take advantage of and exaggerate the propaganda of "Britain and France fully accepting the principles of the Soviet Union's proposal" in an attempt to shift the blame for failure or delay the actual responsibility. Both of these points cannot be ignored. Now Molotov reiterated in his speech Stalin's warning that "the Soviet Union will never pull chestnuts out of the fire for others." When Molotov reported this, all the representatives cheered and applauded thunderously. Key political, military, and diplomatic personnel such as Stalin, Voroshilov, and Litvinov also participated in the cheering, which lasted for five minutes. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's serious attitude today will serve as a serious lesson to all delaying, wavering, and hypocritical tendencies in the anti-aggression movement.</p>
<p>However, Molotov's speech did not increase the difficulty of the negotiations on the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, but powerfully promoted this negotiation in the right direction, prompting it to move towards organizing an effective anti-aggression front and establishing a path to collective security. Molotov re-declared the basic principles of Soviet diplomacy, saying, "The Soviet Union thoroughly advocates uniting all peace-loving countries to jointly resist aggression." Molotov also re-declared the Soviet Union's enthusiastic and serious attitude towards the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, saying, "The Soviet Union insists that the tripartite mutual assistance agreement must be of an absolutely defensive nature, guarantee all Soviet allies, and establish a specific agreement that if one of the signatory countries is attacked, the other signatory countries must provide substantial assistance." These two points not only clearly prevent Britain and France from using the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as a tool to seek "victory" in negotiations with Germany and Italy, but also, regarding the part where Britain and France admit to bearing mutual responsibility in the British and French proposal, point out that this "further step" by Britain and France can serve as a prerequisite for the possible completion of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the future. It also actively taught Britain and France that only by fully basing the collective security system in Europe and even the Far East on the principles of the Soviet Union's proposal can they truly and effectively prevent and defeat the fascist aggressors. We believe that Molotov's speech will undoubtedly increase the international credibility of the Soviet Union's peace policy, will undoubtedly increase the fighting courage and determination of the vast masses of people in various countries, and will also increase the awareness of the progressive parties and even the government authorities in Britain and France, and move towards the path of a truly effective anti-aggression united front. This also refutes the unfounded malicious doomsayers who are pessimistic about the cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and the anti-aggression movement.</p>
<p>The re-declaration of Soviet foreign policy will undoubtedly further enhance the credibility of the Soviet Union's policy of safeguarding peace on a global scale, and will undoubtedly further encourage the development of the anti-aggression united front of all democratic peace-loving countries and oppressed and invaded countries. Our China, which is bravely resisting aggression, should seize this favorable condition in the international situation to strengthen our unity and struggle.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Life of Overseas Chinese in the War of Resistance: General Situation in Siam, Vietnam, and Malaya - Speech by Dong Shuhua, Member of the China Walking Corps <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Kuala Lumpur Correspondence] Dong Shuhua, Chen Fuyuan, Cai Shunqin, and other members of the Nanyang team of the China Walking Corps, having traveled through seven countries for seven years, recently arrived in Kuala Lumpur. In response to the joint invitation of Tsun Jin High School and Kuen Cheng High School, they delivered a speech at 2:30 pm in the Tsun Jin Auditorium on the experiences of the corps' walking journey and the conditions in various places, and held a film exhibition. More than 900 male and female teachers and students from the two schools attended the event. After the chairman gave a welcoming speech, Dong Shuhua was invited to speak. The following is an excerpt from his speech:</p>
<p>Overview of Annam</p>
<p>After we ran out of Zhennan Pass, our footsteps stepped onto the land of Annam. As everyone knows, this country, which has been a tributary state of our country for more than 2,000 years, had its territory and color lightly changed in 1884 when Li Hongzhang concluded the Treaty of Tianjin with the French envoy. Moreover, when we lost this tributary state, our army, led by Cen Yuying, Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou, and Feng Zicai, Brigadier General of Guangxi, went out of the pass and fought against the French army, successively recovering several famous cities. In Liangshan, they even defeated the French army utterly. When the news of this defeat reached Paris, the French government and the public were greatly shocked, but the news of our army's victory was delayed in reaching Beijing. Li Hongzhang was a master of negotiation. Regardless of the situation on the front lines, he hurriedly concluded a peace treaty, recognizing Annam as a protectorate of France. The relationship between our country and the tributary state of Annam was thus severed. Perhaps it is impossible to find a second case in world history where land was lost even after winning a battle.</p>
<p>The residents of Annam include Annamese, Cambodians, Thai people, Chams, Laotians, and mixed-race Annamese and Chinese. Among them, the Annamese account for seven-tenths of the total population and are the largest ethnic group among the ruled. Their race belongs to the Mongoloid race. Their clothing retains the style of the Ming Dynasty in our country. The brick and tile houses they live in are also similar to those in our country. Their food is mainly rice, and their dishes are nothing more than fish, meat, and vegetables. Their language and writing have been influenced by our country. Originally, Chinese was commonly used. The sentence structure of the language was also the same as in our country. Later, the French authorities Latinized the literature and writing and explored it as the national language for Annam, only then abolishing Chinese. However, the elderly Annamese still recognize Chinese. Other ceremonies for weddings, funerals, and celebrations generally follow our country's customs. The people's quality, integrity, and perseverance are undoubtedly the result of being immersed in our country's culture, which is how they became an excellent nation.</p>
<p>The subsequent ethnic groups, such as Cambodians, Laotians, Thai people, and Chams, are all ethnic groups that invaded with superiority. Later, they gradually developed and scattered throughout various parts of Annam. Their way of life preserves a certain habit. If we have the opportunity, we will elaborate on them one by one. For the time being, we will omit them. As for the mixed-race people of Chinese and Annamese descent, their customs and habits are exactly the same as ours, but legally, they have partially become Annamese.</p>
<p>At present, France governs Annam, with a Governor-General as the chief executive, responsible for implementing the policies of the entire colony in terms of politics, military affairs, diplomacy, judiciary, society, and finance. He resides in Hanoi. There is also a Deputy Governor-General in Cochinchina. The remaining provinces, such as Tonkin, Laos, and Cambodia, each have a garrison commander or special commissioner who is directly under the control of the Governor-General in Hanoi. Although the original imperial family and tribal chiefs still use their original titles, they are all nominal and have no possibility of exercising power. In the past few decades of French rule, there have been three histories of national struggle. Initially, the Annamese royal family and landlords opposed the rule of imperialism, leading the people to rise up and resist the French army. The second was a collective force of farmers demanding improved living conditions. The third was the people suffering from the pain of national subjugation, rising up to demand national liberation. However, none of the three national struggles were successful. We understand that only by uniting with the small and weak nations of the world can nations oppressed under iron hooves achieve true liberation and equal treatment. Therefore, the people of Annam are now eagerly looking forward to our country's victory in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Because France restricts the inflow of foreign capital, the development of commerce in Annam is very slow. At present, some ethnic groups still use barter trade, but in urban areas with convenient transportation, ordinary commerce is generally controlled by our overseas Chinese compatriots, which is indeed a superior position compared to other ethnic groups. However, most of the imported goods are French products. The goods from our country exported to Annam are really pitifully small, accounting for only 1% to 2%. The reason is that France adopts a "home country centrism" for its colonies, which is the opposite of the "free trade doctrine" adopted by Britain for its colonies. Therefore, unless it is a necessary commodity, they will definitely restrict the import of foreign goods to the extreme. Therefore, the sale of our country's goods in Annam is negligible. Other major industries, such as agriculture, fishing, etc., are also controlled by the French, and Chinese have very few investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese compatriots in Annam are still free to engage in national salvation work. The Annamese government has not interfered with fundraising, donations, and public services.</p>
<p>Overview of Siam</p>
<p>Siam is a world-renowned rice-producing country, gaining a large amount of production due to its endowed fertile land and suitable climate. In addition to self-sufficiency, most of the surplus is sold all over the world. Even in the southern provinces of our country, a lot of rice is imported from Siam every year. In addition to rice, which ranks first among exports, followed by tin, then wood, rubber, mineral products, fisheries, and other agricultural products, 95% of the commerce and economic lifeline of Siam is controlled by our overseas Chinese. All export merchants, large and small shops, are run by our Chinese. The proportion of inferior goods sold in the market is as high as 60%, and our domestic goods account for only a little over 20%. Since the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have truly awakened and implemented a boycott of enemy goods from top to bottom, giving the aggressors a fatal blow, which can also promote the sales volume of our domestic goods. This is a gratifying phenomenon. However, due to the decline in trade, the Japanese have tried their best to induce the Siamese government to build high tariff barriers to exclude Chinese goods. The recently announced revised tariff regulations are to specially increase the tax rate for the import of Chinese goods, as a preliminary step to completely exclude Chinese goods. The pressure of tyranny cannot shake the patriotism of overseas Chinese. Although it cannot be carried out publicly on the surface, the results of the secret promotion are becoming more and more significant. At the same time, a group of passionate young people have organized assassination squads and iron-blooded corps to do sacred and inviolable work. Although the Siamese authorities are very strict in preventing and arresting them, the passionate young people are still moving forward bravely without retreating. This situation makes the shameless traitors and the traitors who have lost their souls hide themselves in time. The Japanese hate this situation, and they have forced the Siamese government to treat our overseas Chinese unreasonably. For example, last year, they arbitrarily arrested more than 5,000 law-abiding overseas Chinese on the pretext of smoking offenses and sent them back to China. The second time, they arrested more than 3,000 overseas Chinese, saying that they did not have identity documents with them, and deported them back to China. The more overseas Chinese are subjected to all kinds of unreasonable abuse, the more their patriotism burns like a raging fire. We personally heard an overseas Chinese in Bangkok say: "The motherland is our place of return, and our status abroad will naturally increase accordingly. Otherwise, if the country is destroyed, everything of ours will also be over. So, are people who do not love the country human beings?" This remark is the motto of overseas Chinese living under someone else's roof. I sincerely hope that overseas Chinese who do not reside in Siam can also understand this profound meaning, and do their best to protect the country. If the country is strong, it will also protect our overseas Chinese living abroad. Otherwise, won't it be the same as the Jews? I am afraid that there is no place for the people of a perished country to stand. As for Siam, although it is superficially striving to strengthen national defense since the change of government, in fact, it is nothing more than a superficial show. If our country wins the War of Resistance, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not bow their heads and get close to us."</p>
<p>Overview of North Malaya</p>
<p>We ran into North Malaya from Siam, first inspecting Kedah, and then passing through Wellesley, Penang, Perak, and arriving in Selangor. Although we have traveled many times, because these places are all within the scope of British Malaya, the social dynamics are almost the same. However, it is an unavoidable fact that the world's economic depression has affected Malaya. There is unharvested rubber, inactive tin mines, and iron boats. Abundance is originally beneficial to consumers, but the long supply is greater than the demand, causing the value to fall. This is the mistake of a state of anarchic production. The use of methods to limit the production quota to restore the falling price means that the profits of capital and landlords have not lost much, but it has been difficult for the laborers. The opportunity to work is only one in a thousand, and the rest are unemployed, starving and complaining. Starving to death is indeed free. At the same time, the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people naturally reduces the purchasing power of the public. The economic situation is also difficult to recover. The living conditions of ordinary laborers are even more unimaginable. However, laborers are very enthusiastic about national salvation work, which is really admirable. Although Chinese schools in North Malaya are quite developed, due to the environment, the spirit of so-called wartime education is simply nowhere to be seen. As for the future of overseas Chinese here, we are really worried. The reason is that the economic development in the past has reached its highest point, and there is also the concept of factions that is indestructible. If they achieve some success, they will tacitly agree and be satisfied. Moreover, in recent years, they have been attacked by the huge forces of others. If they do not unite and fight, they will only decline.</p>
<p>Finally, we must protect our leader, resist aggression to the end, strengthen the national united front, and strive for the final victory!</p>

<h3 id="e3">× Troops' Attempt to Force a Crossing of the Xiang River Fails; We Directly Attack ×'s Rear Base; New Developments in the Battle Situation in a Few Days <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Haisha Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Since the small-scale clashes near Tianmen Yuejiakou since the day before yesterday have developed into fierce battles, there was a time when 400 Japanese troops secretly crossed the west bank of the Han River, but were driven back. Although no detailed reports have been received from the front line recently, it is impossible to predict the Japanese military's operational plan, but general military observers believe that the Japanese military is engaging in "clearing" the Tianmen Yuejiakou Zaoshi area, which would allow the Japanese military to cross the river and attack the west. However, the Chinese army has long seen through their tricks and is now carrying out mop-up operations against the remaining enemies in Zhongxiang, preparing to break through the rear base of the Japanese military in Xinyang Anlu in one go. Because the Chinese army is advancing rapidly, there will be new developments in a few days. Moreover, because the Chinese and Japanese armies in Hubei Province are using ingenious strategies to break through each other, there will inevitably be a new situation in the war in that area. However, the Japanese military has become a tired division after their disastrous defeat. However, because it is impossible to count the strength of the two armies and their distribution plans, it is really difficult to predict the future battle situation. As for the Xiangbei front, it is still silent. According to Chinese reports, two Japanese detention ships and eight steamships entered Dongting Lake the day before yesterday and docked near Yueyang.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 2nd] According to Chinese sources, the recent counter-offensive by the Chinese army in Hubei Province is making good progress. The Japanese army is now retreating towards Yingcheng and Jingshan, abandoning a large number of military equipment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] On the morning of May 25, about 500-600 × infantry and cavalry from Zhangdian ×, with four cannons, invaded Yunwan in the southwest. After we divided our troops to ambush them from Shangxia Shaogu, after five hours of fierce fighting, the × were unable to hold on and retreated to their original position. In this battle, more than 100 × were killed. On the 22nd, about 700-800 × from Zhangdian, Shuitou, Xiaxian, Guo Wei, and other places invaded Qimu Village south of Wenxi, and were ambushed and repulsed by our troops. At noon on the 26th, more than 100 × infantry and cavalry invaded Xiaoyajiao from the south of Hengshui, and were intercepted by our troops on the way. They also destroyed four miles of highway and two bridge machines in Dongyao. A unit of Jinxiang × in Fensi moved eastward towards Linfen and was intercepted by our troops, killing more than 100 ×. Currently, our army is besieging Jinxiangzhong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 2nd] Near 10,000 × troops gathered in the Zhongyang Lishi Fenyang area, occasionally engaging in small-scale activities westward. Our river defense troops have taken strict precautions. On May 28, more than 1,000 × troops passed through Yeshanqiu (from Zhongyang to the south) and were ambushed on the west side by our troops. They fought fiercely all day long, leaving dozens of bodies behind. On the east side, more than 200 × troops from Heilongguan disturbed Dongpoli and Guanjiazhuang at noon on the 29th, and were repulsed by our ambush troops. On the evening of the 29th, a certain powerful unit of ours raided the × in Jinfangling and captured or killed more than a dozen of them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 1st] At noon on the 27th of last month, about 80 × troops in Shangbai Town (under the jurisdiction of Wukang County) held morning exercises. They were discovered by Pi Shengquan, a soldier of our unit. He crawled forward. When he was at a considerable distance, he threw grenades fiercely. When the smoke cleared, flesh and blood were flying everywhere. More than ten × troops were killed. The remaining × troops retreated in a panic, fleeing in all directions. The soldier returned to his team calmly, believing that his mission had been accomplished. Upon receiving the report, the authorities commended the soldier for his bravery and resourcefulness in defeating the many with the few and will issue an order of commendation.</p>
<p>The Breakthrough of the Lone Army on Mount Lu</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 1st] Yang Yuchun, the commander who held Mount Lu, came to Ji'an for official business. According to his account of the breakthrough from Mount Lu, I led the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the Jiangxi Security Corps, undertaking the guerrilla task in the Mount Lu area. In the past ten months, we fought with the × more than a hundred times, large and small. The × suffered more than 5,000 casualties, and more than 30 officers, including the liaison officer, were killed. The × consumed tens of thousands of artillery shells and more than 3,000 bombs. We also captured several mortars, more than 20 machine guns, and more than 500 rifles and pistols. The × constantly deployed two regiments on the periphery of Mount Lu on major transportation roads and densely laid barbed wire to implement a blockade, but it was often destroyed by us, resulting in great losses. This time, in order to eliminate the rear of Mount Lu, the × gathered a force of about one division, with six aircraft and more than 100 artillery pieces, to attack Mount Lu on four fronts on the dawn of April 16. After fierce fighting until late at night, dozens of hand-to-hand combats were fought, killing a regimental commander and more than 600 soldiers of the ×. In this battle, our casualties were also heavy, and all fortifications were destroyed. In addition, because of our weak forces and the inability to replenish them, we decided to break through. We have now transferred to a certain place and continue to engage in guerrilla warfare. Before the breakthrough, we destroyed the entire Mount Lu Power Plant. The breakthrough time was the evening of April 18. We passed through the × area. When we encountered the ×, we only used bayonets in hand-to-hand combat and never fired our guns. Therefore, the × never discovered the main target of our force, and we were able to safely reach our intended destination. During this long journey through the × area, the civilians rushed to help us carry the wounded and lead the way. From this, it can be seen the high level of resentment and hatred of the × among the civilians in the × area. Finally, I said that I was deeply guilty to the country and the compatriots for my improper command, which led to the fall of the famous mountain. Thanks to the leniency of my superiors in not pursuing the matter, I will sacrifice everything and continue to kill the × and sacrifice for the country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd] On the morning of the 31st, a certain unit of ours launched a counter-attack against the × in Zhangjia (south of Nanchang, east of Xincun), capturing a lot. They immediately captured the area south of Zhangjia.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd] On the morning of the 2nd, there were four × field guns in Hucun, north of Shabei, shelling Zhanggunao (two kilometers north of Xiangfuguan) in Yaozikou. At the same time, a large number of × aircraft assisted in the bombing. Our positions were unchanged.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] The number of × soldiers captured by us is very large. They have all been sent to detention centers and reformed. Most of them have awakened and are extremely resentful of their warlords. Therefore, they are extremely admired for the heroic resistance of our soldiers. The entire prisoner of war detention center here sent a representative, Oshikiri Goro, to comfort our wounded soldiers at the ×× Hospital at 11:00 am on the 1st. After reading the letter of condolence, he thoroughly exposed the tyrannical situation of the × and the difficult situation in the × country. Finally, he joined our wounded soldiers in shouting "Down with the Japanese warlords."</p>

Fighting against aggression with courage, who is without righteous indignation? We and others dwell in foreign lands, but long for our homeland. We wish to provide material assistance and contribute to your divine efforts. Looking westward to our homeland, we are filled with heroic ambition. Considering the difficulties of the times, we earnestly pray for your efforts. Your heroic spirit has been suppressed for too long. We express our sincere feelings with this special telegram of comfort, hoping for your understanding.</p>

It was previously designated by the central government as the Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day, and commemorative measures were formulated and promulgated. This year, the 63rd year, happens to be the centennial of Lin Gong's burning of opium. The Anti-Opium Committee of the Ministry of Interior and the Chongqing Municipal Government, considering that the deadline for the prohibition of opium smoking is fast approaching, and also that it is now the time to implement the National Spiritual Mobilization, have agreed to invite various agencies to hold a commemorative ceremony on the morning of the 3rd. At 7:20 PM in the evening, the Anti-Opium Committee will send personnel to the Central Broadcasting Station to broadcast speeches. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang and the Minister of the Interior will also personally draft and issue instructions and speeches, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="e8">[June 3rd] Centennial Anniversary <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Today is the centennial anniversary of the June 3rd Opium Prohibition. Chairman Chiang has issued an important instruction. Every compatriot who is spared the disaster of being poisoned in the Japanese-occupied territories and lives in a 'land of peace' should repeatedly recite the instruction of the supreme leader.</p>
<p>In our brief commentary, we must intensify international propaganda, using concrete materials to expose the inhumane policy of the Japanese bandits and traitors to poison the population. We must also redouble our efforts to fight against the traitorous plot of poisoning. At the same time, we must especially support the supreme leader's instruction to completely eliminate opium in the country. We must wash away the corruption, darkness, and decline of our great China, advocate a life of 'tension, rigor, unity, and vitality,' and work together for the new birth of China.</p>
<h3 id="e9">American Ambassador to Go to Chongqing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>American Ambassador Johnson arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to go to Chongqing today to meet with our government authorities and inspect the southwestern provinces.</p>
<p>The importance of the United States' position on the Far East issue is a well-known fact. The seriousness of the threat to the United States from Japan's step-by-step encroachment, and the particularly active support work for China in the past two years, are also well-known facts. However, the current even more serious situation is that Japan is shamelessly sending overtures to the United States, while its offensive is thoroughly excluding all British, American, and French interests in China. The United States should pay even more attention to the great significance of our country's insistence on resistance, and the great significance of the United States' call to organize a Far Eastern anti-aggression front. We hope that the American ambassador's trip to Chongqing can make efforts on this point, first of all, to help the preliminary work of the anti-aggression front, that is, to accelerate the movement of American aid to China and the sanctions against Japan.</p>

<p>Today is the anniversary of Mr. Lin Zexu's burning of opium at Humen one hundred years ago. It also coincides with the upcoming second anniversary of our country's war of resistance, at a time when the tide of aggression in the world is becoming increasingly turbulent. As we commemorate our predecessors today, we should certainly increase our determination to prohibit opium and save the country, emulating their virtue, and especially we must have the concept of learning from the past to establish the present and striving to strengthen ourselves. At the end of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, the Qing court's internal affairs were corrupt, and the country's strength was weak. Therefore, Indian opium catered to the preferences of the Chinese people and was transported to China in large quantities. At that time, Lin Gong keenly perceived the scourge of opium poisoning and resolutely advocated prohibition with great fearless spirit, saying, "If this disaster is not eliminated, then in ten years there will be no soldiers to use, and no funds to use." The court at that time and the Chinese people today all admire his famous arguments. For a hundred years, our country's opium prohibition has not been thorough. However, after the Meiji Restoration and the various wars, including the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the European War, the violent and strong Japan has been increasingly determined to implement its unchanging continental policy to invade and gradually approach our country. First, it occupied our Northeast, and not satisfied with that, it invaded our North China, Central China, and South China, attempting to destroy our entire nation. We know that we cannot save the country without resistance, and to achieve the purpose of persevering in resistance, we must mobilize the entire nation to implement the spirit of general mobilization. Thoroughly eliminating opium poisoning is the most important item in the spirit of general mobilization. Originally, before the Japanese aggressors' masks were torn off, they had already done their best to manufacture highly addictive drugs, such as morphine, heroin, and red and white pills, or dispatched ronin to take advantage of their special influence to smuggle and transport them everywhere, or even dispatched their treacherous merchants to establish factories for manufacturing drugs in places under consular jurisdiction and Japanese military protection to produce them in large quantities to poison our people. This fact is known to the world. Since occupying our vast territory, they have become even more blatant, unscrupulous, and actively expanding their poisoning policy. Wherever the Japanese troops arrive, all opium dens and drug addiction centers are openly opened, and they even force our people to smoke opium. Their intention is nothing more than to turn our entire Chinese nation into opium smokers and drug addicts, forcing them to become moribund, not only without the spirit to resist but also accelerating their death and preventing them from reproducing. We must know that if we want to resist to the end and strive for final victory, we must need a large number of soldiers to replenish us. If we do not eliminate opium, how can we have a large number of strong men to replenish the front lines? Lin Gong's saying, "No soldiers to use," was only a prediction to be prepared for danger in times of peace when there were no maritime troubles in those days. In today's all-out war, we feel the importance of the actual relationship even more. Before the War of Resistance, I was specially appointed by the Central Committee to concurrently serve as the Chief Supervisor of Opium Prohibition to handle the opium prohibition affairs of the whole country, and I had already drawn up the most complete plans for prohibiting planting, prohibiting transportation, prohibiting sales, prohibiting smoking, and prohibiting drugs, setting the deadline for complete eradication by the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China. In recent years, due to the tension of the War of Resistance and military affairs, the opium prohibition agencies, although adjusted at the same time as other central agencies, were originally intended to separate the nature of the affairs and make each agency responsible for its own duties, in order to accelerate the promotion of opium prohibition, and not to relax in the slightest. (Central News Agency. To be continued tomorrow.)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Minister of Interior Announces the Main Points of One Year of Opium Prohibition Administration <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Prohibition of Planting] All opium-growing provinces and regions in the country, except for those that have fallen, have already set limits or prohibited planting in advance within the 27th year, and changed to planting food crops. Yunnan also only has a small number of opium fields in the 14 counties of Zhenkang, Lancang, etc., which border Burma and Vietnam or where the natives have not been civilized, and are temporarily allowed to extend the prohibition to the 28th year. During the opium-planting season, each provincial government is responsible for sending personnel to conduct thorough surveys, and personnel are sent from some districts to report violations.</p>
<p>[Prohibition of Transportation and Sales] The Ministry believes that it is difficult to eradicate the malpractices of private transportation, private sales, and private smoking under the old system of managing commercial transportation and sales with ad valorem taxation, so it advocates the implementation of unified collection, unified transportation, and specialized plaster sales. This plan is still being handled by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>[Prohibition of Smoking] Various provinces and cities have achieved considerable success in registering smokers, issuing permits, and implementing phased and batch-based abstinence methods. The Ministry has formulated measures and detailed rules, which have been submitted for approval and implementation. Smokers under the age of 45 are required to abstain within the 27th year, and those over the age of 45 are required to abstain within the 28th year. Self-abstinence methods are also promoted. In addition, methods for provinces, cities, and counties to establish forced-abstinence factories have been formulated and submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. These methods stipulate that factories should be established everywhere to specifically receive and labor for smokers, providing food, accommodation, and medicine, while abstaining from smoking and learning skills.</p>
<p>[Special Funds for Opium Prohibition] Various provinces and cities have misappropriated funds from time to time. Special Management Regulations for Opium Prohibition Funds have been drafted and approved by the Cabinet for implementation, ordering provinces, cities, and counties to establish independent opium prohibition and abstinence funding, strictly implement the budget system, and absolutely prohibit misappropriation.</p>
<p>[Abstinence Medicines] There are many kinds of medicines sold on the market, and there are many malpractices. The Ministry of Health is responsible for preparing good abstinence medicines, and the Opium Prohibition Committee is responsible for unified control and management. As for the recovered areas of the war zone, thorough eradication methods have also been formulated in order to complete the central government's entire opium prohibition plan.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Go to Tongguan - The Words of Seven Brave Warriors <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Tongguan, strategically located at the communication hub of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan provinces, has been a battleground for military strategists since ancient times. In the current situation of resistance against Japan in the Northwest, its gains and losses are particularly important to the overall situation. To put it more clearly, if it can be firmly held by us for a long time without wavering, then the problems of controlling Henan Province, threatening eastern Henan, echoing Xiangyang, protecting the Northwest, and maintaining the international routes in the Northwest can all be "easily solved" and "achieved together." On the other hand, if it unfortunately falls under the iron hooves of the Japanese, the war situation in the Northwest will inevitably change, and there will be one more difficulty in launching a large-scale counter-offensive in the future. But in fact, the heroic achievements of our brave soldiers in defending Tongguan are truly gratifying and admirable! Since the fall of Fenglingdu on the north bank of the Yellow River last year, the Japanese have continuously launched fierce attacks on Tongguan on the south bank. After our brave soldiers' fourteen or five months of desperate defense, Tongguan has been turned into a victorious cornerstone that is as deep and unbreakable as copper nails and iron pillars!</p>
<p>However, what is the magnificent structure of this cornerstone of victory in Tongguan? How does it exert its power to reverse the decline of the Jin situation in the past and serve as a pillar for the protection of the Northwest in the future? So I jumped on the Longhai train heading east from Xijing with joy and hope to conduct an interview.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been very few empty seats on the eastbound express train. Because the old people who had fled from the war zones near southern Shanxi and western Henan to Shaanxi, seeing that the war situation in the front had improved, suddenly had the idea of returning home, depositing their children in the Baozhouyuan orphanage in Shaanxi or at friends' places, and lightly packing their bags to return home. These farmers, still wearing old cotton-padded jackets in the hot weather of Xi'an, some were gazing at the wheat fields waving in the wind on both sides of the Fen River, showing a slight smile that had been absent for a long time. Whether they were thinking of the wheat in their fields, which was probably also ripening like this, welcoming them back to harvest, or imagining the joy of having family reunions upon returning home, or recalling the joy of witnessing a Japanese plane shot down in an aerial battle—in short, "a person with such a smile" must have a motivation that is somewhat related to the "return home issue." The return home issue is indeed a universal and serious problem in the minds of 470 million compatriots at the current stage, especially for all the people who have lost their territories in Northeast China, North China, and Southeast China. Those who are fighting in the front lines and those who are displaced in the interior are naturally thinking of returning to their old homes, and those who are living a subhuman life in the occupied areas are hoping that we will quickly fight back to North China, Southeast China, and Northeast China to restore their inherent comfortable and free lives. It is time for everyone to hurry up and work hard, and the beautiful flower of victory in returning home will soon bloom on everyone's peaceful face!</p>
<p>There were also seven glorious wounded soldiers, no, they were brave soldiers who had recovered from their injuries and were returning to the front line. Their ages were all around twenty, and they were in very good spirits, chatting and laughing all the way, and they also had a "happy return to their hometown" attitude. When asked why they were so happy, from their various answers, I learned that five of them were from Sichuan. When they recalled the reasons for their happiness, their fluent and humorous conversation had the remaining charm of Qin Mi, a famous scholar of ancient Shu, who was known for his eloquence, making everyone's eyebrows dance and their faces light up with smiles, forgetting where the train was going.</p>
<p>Some said: "When we set off from Sichuan the year before last, it was already the beginning of winter, but each of us only wore a single coat, and every two people shared a military gray blanket. Sometimes we shivered all over. When we arrived in Yichang and saw the strong men of Hubei wearing new and thick cotton-padded clothes and setting off in the same direction, we straightened our chests and raised our heads even more proudly, especially those who were barefoot stamped their feet hard on the ground to show the special spirit of the strong men of Sichuan. Later, when we went to the snowy and icy Shanxi to fight, we suffered some unexpected losses due to poor equipment, and of course our morale also suffered a considerable blow. Oh! But as we fought fiercely until last year and this spring, our equipment and new weapons became more and more advanced! The Japanese planes and tanks often encountered 'worthy opponents' and did not dare to flaunt their power and act recklessly. … We have been wounded for more than two months, and now we are returning to the front line, of course we will see some new tricks that are even more advanced. Maybe this time we will chase the Japanese 'gouzi' (Sichuan dialect meaning buttocks) all the way and drive them out—if we are not happy about such a worthwhile thing, wouldn't that make us traitors?"</p>
<p>Some said: "The lives of these comrades of ours can be counted as one life worth several, because we have been wounded several times before, but we have not died. Being treated in the hospital is like getting double pay. When we recover and return to the team, we get promoted one rank according to our original rank. I was just promoted from private to sergeant last time, and now I have recovered and returned to the team, I will have to command a platoon. If I have a platoon to command, if I encounter a Japanese company, whether I go 'bumping' them during the day or 'touching' them at night, I am willing to risk my life, which I have picked up several times, with my brothers to establish a miracle of winning more with less. What a glorious and happy thing this is!"</p>
<p>Several others recounted their exciting battles when they were wounded, saying: "They continued to fight fiercely in XX for a week. In the last two days, the food could not be delivered, and they were so hungry that their stomachs growled, and their spirits were extremely exhausted. As long as the Japanese gunfire stopped slightly, some of them would lean against the trenches and fall asleep. However, when they heard the warning sound, they only needed to open their bloodshot eyes with effort, and each of them would glare at the Japanese and fight them fiercely!"</p>
<p>As one said: "In the melee in XX Village, Zhongtiao Mountain, one of the seven soldiers had his rubber shoes pierced by bamboo roots and was tripped to the ground with a foot injury. A Japanese soldier took the opportunity to raise his gun to stab him. The soldier thought he would surely die, but just as the bayonet was about to reach his chest, the Japanese soldier was shot in the back by another Japanese soldier, and he fell to the ground like a hungry dog snatching food. Before he could even say 'see you again,' he went to Fengdu, Sichuan (a folk reference to the underworld) to travel. Another Japanese soldier, whether he was a puppet soldier from the Northeast who was trying to defect, because the second Japanese line saw that the situation was unfavorable and opened fire, was not clearly recognized at the time. But based on the recent fact that puppet soldiers are defecting on various battlefields, it is determined that he must be a conscious and alert soldier."</p>
<p>As one said: "The Japanese bandits in Jin have been constantly attacked by our brave and unpredictable soldiers, making them suffer in silence, so they have become more and more unscrupulous and do not hesitate to use various despicable and poisonous means; for example: when asking villagers for directions or fire, they have to bow deeply; when encountering people who organize gun clubs with ambiguous attitudes, they bow and salute them even more humbly, secretly instigating Mongolian puppet soldiers to brutally kill our righteous and unyielding people, and on the surface, they publicly give a hypocritical show of sympathy like a cat crying over a dead mouse before execution; especially, they post notices everywhere, vainly attempting to instigate ignorant compatriots to capture and kill our patriotic soldiers, saying that anyone who can capture and kill a soldier of the XX army will be rewarded with 20 yuan, anyone who captures and kills a soldier of the XX army will be rewarded with 30 yuan, and anyone who captures and kills a soldier of the XX army will be rewarded with 50 yuan. Although these methods are very insidious, in reality, apart from exposing their delusion of a toad wanting to eat swan meat, it is just that the Japanese themselves have shown their stingy and cheap appearance—because in the current situation where our military and civilians are united and share life and death, even if the Japanese generously increase the reward to hundreds or thousands of yuan, please rest assured that no one will be willing to capture and kill any part of the patriotic soldiers and take the fruit from the Japanese's mouth to ask the Japanese for a reward!"</p>
<p>— Those seven honorary soldiers spoke of their glorious achievements and the various conspiracies and evil deeds of the Japanese as if they were counting their family treasures, making us feel as if we were listening to a wandering poet of the Greek era chanting the heroes of the past; but even more magnificent, they themselves were the creators of this chant, and what was described in the lyrics were the meritorious deeds they had personally experienced. It really made the listeners fascinated and forget where the train was going.</p>
<p>The headlights on the locomotive continued the mission of the setting sun in the western mountains. Its lightning-like flickering light constantly sent black shadows backward, but after passing through XX, it suddenly carefully restrained the light, and every light in the east wing also followed suit and went out. The passengers also breathed in unison. Each of them savored the taste of "going against the odds" of the night march. Only the train, which was not afraid of dangers and was like a wandering dragon, still could not restrain its angry roar of advancing forward. The march of the train, which was so abnormal, was no different from telling us: This is why we have to be so careful; otherwise, it will give the Japanese, who are only a short distance away, a target to shoot at! — At the same time, it is also announcing that the destination — Tongguan, has been safely passed! Why did we have to pass through? Because it is too dangerous there and we can't safely stop and drop off passengers at XX!</p>

<h3 id="e16">Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations: Efforts Still Underway for Compromise; Rumor that Britain Will Send Representative to Moscow; France Also Willing to Act as Mediator Again <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] British Ambassador Sir Seeds met with Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin today for about half an hour. It is rumored that the discussion was related to the Anglo-French proposal. Sir Seeds also consulted with French Ambassador Naggiar. The official Soviet response to the Anglo-French joint proposal has not yet been sent, but British sources here believe that the response will neither reject nor accept the proposal but will, according to Molotov's remarks, clarify the Soviet position. Mr. Grass's speech has been widely published in the Soviet Union, but no newspapers have commented on it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] It is reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain is currently considering sending Foreign Secretary Halifax or Under-Secretary Butler to Moscow to resolve some of the Soviet Union's objections to the Anglo-French proposal satisfactorily. A Turkish military delegation will arrive here soon to discuss Anglo-Turkish cooperation in the Mediterranean and the purchase of war materials. The British General Staff is now preparing to welcome them. The British naval and military attachés in Ankara have also started their journey back home to facilitate relevant negotiations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] The French government believes that the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations will not reach a deadlock and is now acting as a mediator again to resolve the differences between Britain and the Soviet Union. French Foreign Minister Bonnet is confident that a satisfactory solution can be found regarding the Soviet Union's demand for guarantees for the Baltic states. France appears to be disappointed with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech but does not trust the German and Italian governments' claims that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have failed.</p>
<p>Baltic Key</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 1st] The main difficulty in the current negotiations for the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union lies in the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states. It is rumored that British policy is to send Sterndale Bennett, head of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, as plenipotentiary representative to Moscow to discuss ways to resolve the issue. This issue is becoming increasingly complicated due to the impact of the fortification of the Aaland Islands. The Soviet government recently sent a note to the British government expressing its opposition to the fortification of the Aaland Islands, stating that the islands are located in the Baltic Sea, at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland. If Finland fortifies these islands, the Soviet Union's access to the Baltic Sea from Kronstadt will be cut off, and communication between the Soviet Union and the Gulf of Bothnia will be obstructed. Moreover, Finland's military strength is weak, and there is a great risk that the islands will fall into German hands. If that happens, the Soviet Union will inevitably be greatly threatened. For the time being, the only option is to maintain the current state of the islands and to have the neighboring countries, together with Britain and France, provide guarantees. British government officials say that this kind of guarantee is not something the government is willing to provide. If Finland disregards Soviet opposition and immediately starts fortifying the islands, the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will be adversely affected, which is a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, political figures here recently stated that the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states, namely Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, is the crux of the matter. France seems prepared to offer these countries guarantees, just as it does for Poland, Romania, and Greece. However, some people in London oppose this, arguing that since the Baltic states want to maintain neutrality, and if a war breaks out in that region, the navies of the democracies will be too far away to provide assistance. Britain and France believe that if Germany wants to attack the Soviet Union, it will almost certainly pass through Poland and that it is sufficient to guarantee Poland. So far, Britain and France have not taken a position on this issue for this reason. However, the Soviet Union has the opposite view, believing that Germany is likely to attack the Baltic states and that is why it attaches importance to the fortification of the Aaland Islands.</p>
<p>British Sources Express Optimism</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] Diplomatic circles here unanimously believe tonight that only one important issue remains to be resolved between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and that all other issues are secondary. Although officials have not confirmed what the important point is, it is generally speculated that it concerns the issue of the Baltic states. The Soviet Union's response to the Anglo-French note of last Saturday is expected to be sent on Friday. Diplomatic circles have no doubt that the final outcome of the negotiations will be satisfactory.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 1st] Regarding Molotov's speech, it is generally believed that it does not contain anything that would prevent the smooth completion of the three-nation anti-aggression pact. The London Times and Daily Telegraph explained Molotov's two misunderstandings, which were (1) the clause on the League of Nations Covenant in the Anglo-French proposal, and (2) the issue of the Baltic states. The Times stated that the British government's reference to the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant does not mean that the proposed pact should be hindered by consultations among members of the League of Nations. The Daily Telegraph stated that the issue of the Baltic states is indeed the most difficult issue at present because those countries are determined to maintain neutrality. However, this difficulty should not be insurmountable.</p>
<p>German and Italian Newspapers Intensify Alienation</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Roman sources expressed great disappointment with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on the Anglo-French-Soviet defense pact negotiations, calling it nothing short of "pouring cold water" on Britain. Official commentator Gaeda, a spokesperson for Mussolini, said that the democratic bloc contains structural defects and disputes, and added, "The progress of the three-nation alliance, after a long period of haggling, has greatly reduced its value. This is not the spirit in which to create a genuine and solid military pact. In the conduct of the pact negotiations, everyone seeks to gain something without giving anything, and one can only see haggling without any implementation." The Tribune newspaper stated that the basic tone of the British speech was to express distrust, and added, "The pacts of the Axis powers are as solid as steel, and the Soviet Union and the Western democracies can never conclude any similar pact."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] Since Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's speech on Wednesday, German newspapers have abandoned their original belief that the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations would break down and now believe that "the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance debate" will take a long time to resolve. German newspapers paid no attention to the German-Soviet commercial relations mentioned in Molotov's speech, and official circles were unwilling to comment on them. The Hamburgischer Fremdenblatt stated that Molotov was tolerated by those who wanted to encircle Germany and was able to put forward his own views. The Berliner Angriff criticized that a gust of frost had blown from Moscow and compared it with the constructive peace policy of concluding non-aggression pacts between Germany and Denmark, which was based on the strategy of encircling Germany. The Berliner Lokalanzeiger stated that London was greatly disappointed with Molotov's speech, and a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Molotov's speech did not show any fundamental change in the situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 1st] Molotov's speech has been treated with reserve by political and official circles here. It is generally believed that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are now exchanging views. Since Germany is not directly involved, its views on the encirclement policy are well known and do not need to be stated again. In addition, with the authorization of the government authorities, some people used a satirical tone to contrast the ease with which the Italian-German alliance was concluded with the numerous difficulties of the current Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations.</p>
<p>Anglo-Polish Agreement Actually Concluded</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Warsaw, 1st] It has been learned from authoritative sources that after a meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and the British Ambassador to Poland at the Foreign Ministry, the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement has been effectively concluded. The agreement stipulates that if one party is attacked, the other party shall immediately provide military assistance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 1st] Foreign Secretary Halifax arrived in the capital this afternoon from Chequers and immediately met with Polish Ambassador Raczyński, Portuguese Ambassador Monteiro, and Romanian Minister Tilea. According to well-informed sources, Ambassador Raczyński told Foreign Secretary Halifax that the situation in Europe is currently calm, and the Polish government is not unduly alarmed. However, this state of calm cannot last, and preparations must be made quickly. A British military commission is currently investigating Poland's military needs, especially in terms of artillery and air force. However, the investigation has been going on for a long time, and the report has not yet been submitted, so the amount of credit that the British government can extend to Poland cannot be determined, which is regrettable. It is reported that the British government has ordered the military commission to step up its work and submit its report as soon as possible. It is also learned that Foreign Secretary Halifax and Ambassador Raczyński discussed the issue of transforming the provisional Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement into a concrete agreement, and the two sides were very agreeable. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax and Portuguese Ambassador Monteiro discussed how to reaffirm the current Anglo-Portuguese alliance.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Hitler Boasts, Paul Does Not Believe; Germany Indulges in Showing Off Military Might; Yugoslavia Has No Intention of Submitting <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 2nd] It has been learned that German Leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have both assured Prince Paul of Yugoslavia that the German-Italian alliance is not intended for war and that Germany firmly believes that most European problems can be solved peacefully. The German-Italian talks only discussed various military, political, and economic issues. Although German government leaders have made every effort to strengthen Yugoslavia's ties with the Axis and have attempted to secure Prince Paul's guarantee that he will not enter into negotiations with democratic countries, well-informed sources say that Prince Paul's visit to Germany will not result in a concrete agreement with Germany. German government leaders want to persuade Prince Paul of the value of German friendship and the strength of German military power.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, accompanied by Princess Olga and the Foreign Minister, arrived here this afternoon for an eight-day visit. 70,000 members of the Hitler Youth were ordered to line the streets to welcome them.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e18">After Molotov's Diplomatic Speech <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Molotov's first comprehensive speech since taking office as Soviet Foreign Minister has had repercussions in Europe and the Far East. It is expected that the international situation will undergo a further development. The content of Molotov's speech can be broadly divided into two aspects: one is the opinion on the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, and the other is the response to the Far Eastern aggressors. However, viewed together, these two aspects can be said to be the entire issue of the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>The most important part of Molotov's speech is the expression of doubt about the sincerity of Britain and France in organizing a peace front. Molotov said, "The tripartite mutual assistance agreement proposed by Britain and France to 'resist Nazi and Fascist aggression' is ineffective because of various restrictive conditions." Molotov also pointed out that "the democracies underestimate the changes in the world situation, not only abandoning collective security, but also trying a policy of appeasement; the Soviet Union opposes both of these views." Molotov's speech really hit the nail on the head regarding the hesitation of Britain and France. In the anti-aggression front needs to be established immediately today, Ben has the full necessity. The Soviet Union's real demands are also very simple, as Molotov said: the Soviet government insists that the treaty must be purely defensive and guarantee the concrete treaties concluded by the Soviet Union's neighbors, that if one of the signatory countries is attacked, the other signatory countries will implement aid.</p>
<p>However, since the publication of Molotov's speech, the reactions in Europe, on the whole, are optimistic. Molotov believes that the Anglo-French-Soviet draft treaty is not satisfactory in two points: one is that resistance to aggression must be decided by the League of Nations; the second is that the guaranteed countries do not include the three Baltic states. The British side believes that these two opinions are only different in form, not in substance. Regarding the former point, it is believed that the United Kingdom will not insist on its original intention; regarding the latter point, it is not difficult to find a satisfactory solution: because the Baltic States also need this kind of guarantee. On the other hand, countries that are closely related to this mutual assistance agreement, such as France and the United States, are unanimously advocating that the United Kingdom should concede. According to a Paris dispatch, yesterday, the Paris official level held a meeting with the British ambassador to discuss the issue of the Anglo-Soviet-French treaty. French Foreign Minister Bonnet urged the British ambassador to convey to the British government the Soviet foreign minister's request to extend the guaranteed countries to the Baltic States. Accepted, or completely accepted when the Soviet Union refuses to give in. At present, the biggest obstacle is this. People in the London government have stated that there is no serious disagreement with the consultation of the League of Nations, but they are still reluctant to guarantee the Baltic countries on the grounds that "in law, countries that do not want to accept guarantees should not be forced to accept guarantees." But if the United Kingdom can listen to France's advice and accept the Soviet Union's request, then the three-nation mutual assistance agreement will be realized soon. Even the U.S. State Department is optimistic. According to the speculation of a certain person close to the White House, even if there are concerns about the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union concluding an alliance treaty, the countries that love peace are still under serious threat at this moment, and the United Kingdom will weigh the pros and cons and make a decisive decision. We believe that today, when the aggression of Germany and Italy is intensifying, the British government will not violate public opinion and cause the three-nation treaty to be stranded again!</p>
<p>Another key point of Molotov's speech is the issue of the Far East. Molotov is particularly concerned about China's resistance to Japan, and he emphasized Stalin's declaration on helping the invaded countries and countries that fight for national independence is now fully applicable to China, "We are always implementing this policy." Japan has recently used its deceptive means to divert attention at home and abroad, challenging the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, and expanding its propaganda. But the Soviet Union believes that "it cannot be tolerated" and will protect Outer Mongolia. A point that deserves special attention here is that today, when the Japanese aggressors want to use the challenge to the Soviet Union to alleviate its conflict with Britain and France, the Soviet Union will pay more attention to the Far East issue. Molotov, in his speech, compared the Far East issue with the European issue, saying: "This matter is completely in line with the Soviet Union's work in Europe to unite peace-loving countries to form a common front to resist aggression." Therefore, people around the U.S. State Department speculate that the key to the Soviet Union's unwillingness to accept the Anglo-French draft is the Far East issue. The United States has recently shown an increasing tendency to strengthen its Far East policy, and naturally hopes that this suggestion from the Soviet Union can be accepted by Britain and France. We are eagerly hoping that Britain and France will consider this sentence more deeply: "The peace of the world is indivisible"; Japan's feigned violation of the Soviet Union is only a diplomatic and internal strategy!</p>
<h3 id="e19">After U.S. Submarine Sinks, New British Submarine Crashes Again; Thetis Sinks in the Irish Sea; Rescue Efforts Being Intensified; Five People Reported Alive <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The new British submarine "Thetis" was test-diving in Birkenhead yesterday when, after diving, it failed to resurface. People here were deeply worried about its fate last night. It is reported that the submarine has not surfaced for several hours. The Admiralty is preparing all possible rescue steps. Cammell Laird, the builder of the submarine, said that there were about 20 employees of the company and many Admiralty experts on board. It left the dock at 10 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by an auxiliary ship. The Admiralty received a telegram from the ship stating that the submarine had disappeared. Nearby warships have sailed to assist in the search. The submarine can carry 53 people, with a displacement of about 1,000 to 1,500 tons, a length of 265 feet, and a speed of 15 knots per hour. Its armament includes a 4-inch gun, and six torpedo tubes, with a construction cost of £350,000.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] After the British submarine "Poseidon" crashed and sank in Chinese waters, British submarines are now specially built with two escape hatches, through which the crew can escape in case of emergency. In addition, a marker buoy is installed, which can float out of the submarine and to the surface of the sea, indicating the location of the submarine, so that ships on the sea can carry out rescue. Each crew member is equipped with escape gear that provides oxygen. The Admiralty issued a communiqué at 11 p.m. last night, stating that the submarine "Thetis I" had not resurfaced after entering the water at Liverpool at 1:40 p.m. yesterday. There were five officers, 48 sailors, four other officers, and the architects on board, but the number of people is not clear. Many British ships have now arrived at the location where the submarine was last reported, and many aircraft have been dispatched to search before dusk. The patrol will continue today. The first destroyer, the first mine-sweeper, the submarine "Challenger I", and the "Nautilus" and the warship "Valhalla" have all sailed to the scene of the accident at top speed to assist in the rescue. The Chief of Submarine Staff, Mr. McIntyre, has also set off for Jersey to be responsible for rescue operations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Cammell Laird announced that the location of the "Thetis" submarine has been found. When the company secretary announced the news to the crew's relatives and friends, the crowd cheered with joy, and some shouted "Thank God." The secretary told Reuters that "Thetis" submarine was discovered by an aircraft that dropped a Class A marker bomb. As for the location, it cannot be announced at present. Twenty-one British ships and other ships are rushing to Liverpool to assist in the search with sea lights and torches in order to carry out rescue. Amateur radio operators used shortwave radios to hear a telegram sent by a rescue ship last night stating that the submarine was seven miles from the Mersey, 180 feet under water, which means that the submarine is about 25 miles from Liverpool.</p>
<p>Generally expected to be close also, it is said that there is enough white air inside the boat for 36 hours for naval officers fearing the or with the sunken ship or other objects on the seabed connected resulting in damaged electrical equipment because there are many sunken ships near the boat under place.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Sir Robert Davis, inventor of the famous Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, told the Associated Press today that the submarine "Thetis" does not have any serious difficulties. The submarine only has mechanical difficulties. The entire crew will do their best to try to resurface. When the "Poseidon" submarine was lost in Weihaiwei in 1931, the "Davis" escape apparatus was used, and it was very effective.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Cammell Laird, the builder of the submarine "Thetis", announced that all the crew members of the submarine are safe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Admiralty has announced that the location of the "Thetis" submarine is still 14 miles from the sea. Four crew members have been rescued. The Admiralty had previously received information that the submarine had begun to move, but that was not true. The head of the submarine is now 130 feet underwater, and the tail is exposed above the water. The Admiralty also announced that the captain of the "Thetis" submarine and four other personnel have now been rescued. The four sailors were rescued by using the "Davis" escape apparatus, including Commander Wren of the Fifth Submarine Flotilla. The Admiralty said that high-explosive devices will soon be used at the tail of the submarine that floats to the surface to form a hole so that the submarine can float.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] This American Club held a weekly dinner meeting this afternoon. Chinese Ambassador to France Koo Vi-kyuin, Ambassador Zong, Counselor Zheng Yiyi, Secretary Xie Dongfa, Canadian Minister Jean Désy, U.S. Ambassador, Counselor Hugh Robert Wilson, Chief Assistant Secretary of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Avant, were all in attendance. The club's chairman, Su Pu, first delivered a speech, expressing respect to the Chinese nation, saying that the Chinese nation's heroic resistance to Japan and defense of freedom is admired by the world. Ambassador Koo then spoke, recalling the origins of the Open Door Policy, saying that Japan is using all its strength to destroy this policy, intending to take all the benefits retained by foreigners and make China an economic and political hegemony. Since the Manchurian region was occupied by the Japanese army, foreign trade has been completely suspended, and the development of various raw materials has been monopolized by the Japanese. The Japanese are now promoting this method in North China and Central China, and controlling its postal service, telecommunications, seaports, railways, inland river navigation, power plants, and oil wells, using the control of all Chinese resources as a new aggression, in an attempt to control the whole world. It can be seen that the Far East incident is actually related to the nationalities of all countries. China's resistance to aggression is defending freedom, and countries with interests in the Far East are most dependent on it to defend their freedom.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Hong Kong Government Strictly Prohibits Pig Farming in Kowloon Peninsula Three to Forty Thousand Farmers ×××× Ban Reaffirmed to be Implemented from the 17th of this Month Villagers from Various Rural Areas Send Representatives to Meet the Secretary for Chinese Affairs to Appeal for Maintenance <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Municipal Health Bureau recently announced the enforcement of a decision made in 1935 to ban villagers from raising pigs in various districts of the Kowloon Peninsula, ordering farmers to sell off all pigs, large and small, before the stipulated date, or face prosecution. After the announcement of this ban, the three to four thousand villagers in dozens of villages on the peninsula were alarmed. Once the authorities ban pig farming, it will affect their livelihood, as there is no hope for vegetable cultivation either. Representatives of various rural elders gathered several times to hold meetings and elected twelve representatives to appeal to the authorities.</p>
<p>Villagers from various rural areas signed to receive orders</p>
<p>The villagers and farming households raised over a thousand dollars to hire Barrister Luo Lianxun to negotiate with the authorities, pleading for consideration of the suffering of tens of thousands of people and withdrawing the order so that their livelihoods could be maintained. The representatives explained the difficulties encountered by farmers after the ban on pig farming, as well as the impact on the supply of food to Hong Kong residents and the various commercial reasons. Barrister Luo separately sent letters to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs and the Chinese representative of the Municipal Health Bureau to appeal. Barrister Luo informed the rural representatives to meet with the Secretary for Chinese Affairs yesterday afternoon, and then discussed with the relevant authorities whether the order could be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Related to Hygiene Determined to Strictly Prohibit</p>
<p>According to a senior health official, the authorities issued an ordinance several years ago to ban pig farming by farmers on the Kowloon Peninsula. The health authorities are now resolutely implementing it because they have carefully considered the importance of the matter. The pig farming practices of villagers on the peninsula do not conform to modern animal husbandry principles, and the places are unclean, leading to the proliferation of mosquitoes, which is detrimental to health. Residents in various districts of the Kowloon Peninsula have suffered from this. The significant increase in toxic mosquitoes in various districts of the peninsula in recent years is a clear indication, which not only exposes residents of the peninsula to mosquito bites but also directly and indirectly poses a significant threat to the health of the entire population. For the sake of protecting the health of all residents, the health authorities must announce the ban on pig farming by residents of the peninsula to eliminate the source of toxic mosquitoes and eradicate various infectious diseases caused by filth, so that the sanitary administration can be improved.</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Farmers ××××</p>
<p>However, these livestock farmers on the peninsula have been leasing barren land on Tai Mo Shan from the Hong Kong government at a small rent for grazing, vegetable cultivation, and chicken farming. Families depend on this for food and clothing. Although their livestock farming practices do not meet sanitary standards, if the authorities issue a ban, how will these farmers and their families survive? This is a matter that those who care about the people cannot ignore. Some believe that this can be used to promote a change in occupation, but the flames of war in Guangdong are still raging. Even if these people have homes in their villages, they may not be able to return. If the authorities are acting to protect the health of all people, they should find ways to make these pig farmers clean and improve, so that those who rely on livestock farming for their livelihood are not left with nothing to depend on. This is also for the sake of the city's appearance and public order. If these farmers lose this source of livelihood, they will inevitably end up in the lower classes, or those who cannot endure poverty will resort to desperate measures, which is not the original intention of the authorities to maintain the health of all people.</p>

<p>The second day of the fifth special horse race, which was postponed due to wind and rain, will be held today, but the time has been changed again, with the horses starting at 1:30 PM and the race starting at 2:00 PM, with a total of ten races expected to end around 7:00 PM. Fortunately, the days have been getting longer recently, so it will not be too dark even at 7:00 PM in the afternoon. Now that the sky has cleared, if there is more sunshine today, the turf will be drier and firmer, and the race time will be faster than before. Horses that are good at racing in the rain may not have an advantage. As for the summer one-dollar lottery, 90,000 tickets have already been sold. With only one week left before the draw (June 10), the sales may have been slightly affected by the continuous heavy rain in recent days. Because there are not many opportunities, those who want to make a fortune are rushing to buy, which will be very enthusiastic, and the result is expected to reach 150,000 tickets.</p>

<p>The second performance of the Carnival organized by the Hong Kong Branch of the China Wartime Children's Relief Association, which was originally scheduled to be held this afternoon at the private residence of Sir Ho Tung on the Peak, has been postponed to Saturday, the 17th of this month, from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, due to the horse racing season today, as it is feared that people from all walks of life will not be able to attend. It is understood that the various entertainment items in this carnival are more exciting and wonderful than the previous one. The most notable is the children's clothing show. It is heard that this show is very exquisite. The audience at the previous event was too crowded, so those who arrived later regretted not being able to see it. Therefore, this special performance will be performed twice, the first time at 3:30 PM that afternoon and the second time at 4:30 PM, so that all visitors can enjoy it regardless of when they arrive. At the same time, kindergarten students from the Children's Home of the Association will perform Western classical music and national salvation songs.</p>
<h3 id="e33">The Haitian Wheel is Troubled in Fujian Most of the Passengers and Goods Were Forced to Return to Hong Kong × Warships in the Waters of Fujian Fired at Barges Carrying Passengers Arriving in Quanzhou, Passengers and Goods Were also Blocked British Warships Escorted Them Out of Fujian <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The British vessel Haitian, which sails between Hong Kong and Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Shantou, departed from Hong Kong last month fully loaded with groceries and two cars, carrying over 300 passengers. It first arrived in Shantou, passed through Xiamen and Quanzhou, and went straight to Fuzhou, arriving on the 26th. It anchored at Chuanshi Mountain in the Fuzhou estuary. Because × warships were circling nearby, the goods for Fuzhou were prevented from being unloaded, resulting in a large number being transported back to Hong Kong. Except for a very small number who ventured to land, there were over 30 passengers who could not land and returned to Hong Kong on the original vessel. The vessel safely arrived at 9:20 AM yesterday. Apart from some bamboo mats and groceries for Shantou, there were no other goods. The sailing schedule was delayed by about a week. It is understood that this incident happened when × announced the blockade of our country's ports starting this month, which has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. The reporter boarded the ship yesterday to investigate, and the information obtained is described below.</p>
<p>× Warships Gathered in Fujian to Strafe Barges Carrying Passengers</p>
<p>According to passengers, when the Haitian vessel arrived at the Fuzhou estuary on the 26th of last month, there were twelve × warships circling in the area, and ten × speedboats were patrolling the waters, monitoring the entry and exit of merchant ships from various countries. The situation was very tense. The vessel changed its anchorage to the sea off Chuanshi Mountain, which was more protruding. Barges coming and going, whether passenger boats or those transporting food supplies, were strafed by × speedboats with machine guns. Several passengers on the ship ventured to leave the ship and board barges to go ashore, resulting in being strafed by ×. The sound of gunfire was very dense at the time, and it is believed that there were many casualties.</p>
<p>× Warships Sent Aircraft to Bomb Fuzhou Madly</p>
<p>Because of this, other boats dared not approach the ship to transfer passengers. At the same time, unless there was a special permit issued by our Fuzhou Garrison Headquarters, no one was allowed to land. Therefore, most passengers were trapped on the ship. At that time, the ship originally planned to wait and see before sending the passengers ashore, but day after day, the harassment of the × speedboats continued. Later, two or thirty aircraft were sent out from the warships every day to bomb various parts of Fuzhou. During the four days that the vessel was anchored in Fuzhou, it saw × aircraft bombing Fuzhou five or six times. Judging from the situation, Fuzhou has now entered a state of war.</p>
<p>British Warships Escorted Five Vessels Simultaneously Out of Port</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM on the 13th of last month, the Haitian vessel, together with the Haicheng, Haimen, and a Jardine vessel, a total of five vessels, safely left Fuzhou under the protection of British warships. Most of the goods that the vessels were transporting to Fuzhou could not be unloaded. Only 1.5 million yuan in banknotes sent by the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation to its Fuzhou branch, and 1,292 boxes of wax, were able to be unloaded. Only a small number of passengers ventured to land, and over 30 passengers on the Haitian vessel returned to Hong Kong on the original vessel. Because the manager of a certain company was responsible for transporting them to Fuzhou, the loss was over 400 yuan. After leaving Fuzhou, the vessel sailed to Quanzhou, where it also saw a giant × warship, an aircraft carrier, and several speedboats in the Quanzhou estuary. Because the same situation occurred, no one dared to sail close. The passengers and all the goods on board could not be unloaded. At the same time, × aircraft constantly flew over Quanzhou and the mainland to bomb, so the vessel sailed back to Shantou, arriving one day later. No × warships were seen anchored in the waters of Shantou, and the city was still very peaceful. A small amount of goods were delivered to Hong Kong, and it arrived yesterday morning. It is scheduled to enter the shipyard for repairs during the day.</p>
<p>The Jardine Vessels Sail as Usual</p>
<p>According to a Jardine Shipping Company spokesperson, the Haitian vessel's daytime maintenance is normal and there are no other problems. It is an annual repair as usual. The Haicheng vessel is expected to arrive in Hong Kong from Shantou tomorrow morning, and the goods for Fuzhou will be returned on the original vessel. When asked whether the passengers on the vessel would return on the original vessel, the spokesperson replied that some would, and they would also be the cargo escorts. He also said that the company's vessels would continue to sail as usual in the future.</p>

<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>The Lee Gardens Sleeves Hall is a beautiful place to go; however, the guests attending all said in unison: "The road is not easy to walk." Take a break and rest comfortably for a while before starting the small group gathering.</p>
<p>This is the third film and drama symposium hosted by the Film and Drama Weekly of this newspaper, and we are very grateful to the drama pioneers and friends who came to participate.</p>
<p>In addition to all the members of the "China Relief" troupe, the guests included Ouyang Yuqian, Xia Yan, Tang Shuming, Zhang Xuefeng from the drama world, and Tang Huaiqiu representing Jin Jiabao, etc.; Luo Jingyu from the film world, and he also served as the representative of Cai Chusheng, etc., because Mr. Cai and others are busy filming! The painters included Zhang Zhengyu, Zhang Guangyu, and Ding Cong. The writer was Ma Guoliang. There were also many friends from the drama, cultural, and press circles. There were more than fifty people gathered together. The sensational "China Relief" performance in Hong Kong served as the center of everyone's conversation. Among the guests were friends from "China Relief", and each different face evoked memories of the stage. That mute, that old man... It was interesting to see the real faces, talking and laughing, the atmosphere was very harmonious.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon after 3:00 PM, Chairman Lu Fu first briefly explained the influence of "China Relief" on the new and national salvation drama movement over the past eleven years. From the strict and hard-working spirit of "China Relief"; to the thorough work goal of "China Relief" in promoting resistance against Japan and opening up a new foundation for emerging drama. He especially opened the way of working of China Relief in the past twenty months, and talked about how they used all possible methods to call on the public for more than 700 performances, how to penetrate into the vast classes of peasants and soldiers, and at the same time solemnly stated that they were in Hong Kong for the 742nd large-scale charity performance for the various sectors of the Relief Association, and the 743rd public performance for entertaining the public and students in Hong Kong, and the exquisite and magnificent great performances that were lived-out from the realities of life with the power of collective understanding and highly honed techniques had unprecedentedly expanded the field of dramatic effects and influence, and given a serious and fierce stimulus to the Hong Kong national salvation drama movement, hoping that all the advanced people present can give progressive discussions and encouragement to this performance, so that Hong Kong drama workers can accept their valuable experience and lessons, and finally, put forward the scope of discussion for this symposium, 1. the significance and influence of the "China Relief" performance in Hong Kong - the great significance of the performance, the impact on the general public, the reaction that drama workers in Hong Kong should have, 2. acting skills, stage technology, and so on, 3. the development of the national salvation drama movement - what is the foundation of the national salvation drama movement? the consciousness and form of the national salvation drama movement, the form and content of the national salvation drama movement, what efforts should dramatists make in the future...</p>
<p>Everyone enthusiastically welcomed Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, who was full of hope, who spoke first amid applause: "Serious, Disciplined, Passionate, Cordial" encompasses the entire picture of China Relief: the hard-working spirit and strict organization are very rare. The success of the performance goes without saying. The beauty of the sky curtain is the first time ever in Hong Kong. He earnestly hoped that young drama workers in Hong Kong would have a strict organization and let their passion and vitality develop well. Although the material conditions are difficult, they must also grow in difficult environments.</p>
<p>When Mr. Xia Yan spoke, everyone paid special attention. The performance of China Relief is clearly a rare opportunity. All criticisms are based on facts and are maintained and praised. Mr. Xia, however, gave a strict critique, loving deeply and hoping earnestly. The friends of China Relief were very grateful for the well-intentioned instructions, and everyone also felt the depth and strictness of Mr. Xia's speech.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Jingyu first talked about the experience of co-producing a film with China Relief in Wuhan, and then said that when he watched "Defending the Country" this time, he also shed tears with the audience around him. He hoped that China Relief would make more efforts in the film aspect. This young owner of the China Film Studio also praised China Relief as "beautiful and simple," which is a very appropriate comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xuefeng, the director of China Travel Agency, spoke vividly about stage design, with gestures and expressions that made people very interested. He was the only one who spoke Cantonese. The friends of China Relief took this opportunity to learn dialects, and they all stared intently with their mouths open. Especially the demeanor of Mr. Dai Ziying was particularly strong.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Guoliang said that the most meaningful thing about China Relief's performance is that through drama, the theater has become a lively and intense public assembly. This is a good reality that Hong Kong has not had in the past two years of the Anti-Japanese War. - This is also the truth.</p>
<p>The artist Zhang Guangyu said that from the perspective of calligraphy and painting, the installations and lighting of the China Relief performances are very beautiful. Colleagues have also praised it in the same way. Mr. Ding Cong said that he had nothing to say, only a little bit, and this little bit was also a good supplement, which caused everyone to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Qinghua said that he had interviewed a worker audience. China Relief is deeply moving and the performance is successful.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan spoke, his "hoarse" voice had not yet recovered. He thanked this serious and sincere symposium. Wang Ying and Lin Shu expressed their gratitude to the friends who helped in all aspects.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang was the first to speak, and Mr. Ouyang was the last to speak. He solemnly said that it is already commendable that China Relief can do this. "We must all learn from each other, not be afraid of making mistakes, as long as we admit mistakes, correct them, and seek progress," this is a moving motto.</p>
<p>May everyone remember that Mr. Ouyang is so humble and learn from Mr. Ouyang's thirst for knowledge</p>
<p>After the chairman gave a speech of thanks, everyone ate "beautiful and simple" refreshments, took a group photo, and wished everyone eternal love, mutual learning, and standing together to welcome the great era.</p>

The radio can receive all radio stations in the Far East. The real price is 49 yuan and 50 cents per set, which is indeed an unprecedented record of low price and exquisite radio in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e38">[Mourning] In Hong Kong (Continued) <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>Carrying paper money to "buy water" for the deceased to wash their face; at the death of parents, the son must write a memorial with the words "Gratitude for Labor Unrepaid" or "The Limitless Sky"; returning the soul... all of these are not in the ancient rituals. They are vulgar people's forced associations and presumptuous acts.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I can turn the pen and talk about the mourning itself -</p>
<p>Whenever someone dies at home, a practicing Western doctor must sign a certificate and register it with the Births and Deaths Registry of the Health Bureau to obtain a registration certificate before burial.</p>
<p>The cemeteries for burial are all designated. Residents west of Taiyuan Street in Wan Chai, including Central, Sheung Wan, and Sai Ying Pun, must be buried in the Jilonghuan Public Cemetery. Residents east of Taiyuan Street, including Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, and Shau Kei Wan, must be buried in the Coffee Garden or Chai Wan Cemetery. On the Kowloon side, there is the Kowloon Public Cemetery.</p>
<p>These cemeteries are built level by level, digging graves around the hillside, with each grave less than three feet apart, looking like the seats in a theater from a distance. Living in Hong Kong is crowded and land-scarce; dying in Hong Kong is also crowded!</p>
<p>The mountain land is divided into several types: five dimes, one yuan, three yuan, and five yuan. The burial is based on the lot number. There is no choice. In this environment, the concept of feng shui is completely dispelled.</p>
<p>The graves in these cemeteries do not have any mounds, let alone a Luo acupoint, "Green Dragon" or "White Tiger"; the rich use cement to make a rectangular platform for worship, with a monument erected on it, half-Chinese and half-Western, which is considered a tomb. The poor only erect a short stele about a foot high on the ground, with a lot number stone erected behind it, and the weeds grow wildly. Often it is submerged and cannot be found.</p>
<p>In addition to public cemeteries, the rich can be buried in the "Eternal Cemetery" in Aberdeen. The mountain land in this cemetery is wider, the construction is better, and the cost of each lot is more than 30 yuan. It is "eternal" unlike public cemeteries that require the exhumation of bones and relocation seven years after burial.</p>
<p>Various religions have their own cemeteries dedicated to burying their members.</p>
<p>Those who die in hospitals hold funerals in the open space next to the mortuary. The hospital does not have a well-built place for people to hold funerals. What is most unsatisfactory is that the servants take the opportunity to ask for money; for example, if the family hires a Nammo to chant scriptures, they have to burn paper money for them... There are too many to list.</p>
<p>As for the main item of mourning - the coffin; the price is not fixed. A thin coffin costs ten or eight dollars, a medium one costs fifty or sixty dollars, and expensive wood materials such as Tingzhou wood and agarwood cost one or two thousand dollars, which is more expensive than a new 1939 car—</p>
<p>Western-style coffins have become very popular in recent years, and the price is not necessarily cheap. The most ordinary one costs more than a hundred yuan, and a fancy coffin costs two or three thousand yuan, which is not something that ordinary people can afford.</p>
<p>No matter how noble or humble, they are all withered bones. Death is originally the most equal thing, but the rituals of death are not equal. The saying "Wealthy at thirty is respected, poor at eighty is a young death" is aimed at satirizing the rituals of mourning.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Guangdong Provincial Government Formulates Nine Wartime Taxation Regulations, to be Announced and Implemented from June 1st <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Express News) The Guangdong Provincial Government, for the sake of wartime needs, yesterday considered the supply and demand situation of various goods in the province and formulated the "Special Tax Wartime Taxation Rules for Imported Goods," which will be announced and implemented from June 1st of this year. Hereafter, all special taxes and tax levies on imported agricultural products and sundry goods will be handled in accordance with these wartime tax rules. The original tax rules are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All items listed below, regardless of whether they are mixed in by steamer, sailboat, vehicle, or other means, will be taxed in accordance with these tax rules: A. Products smuggled in from abroad or guerrilla war zones; B. Cosmetics and decorative articles transported in from other provinces, and products taxed according to the originally promulgated regulations; C. Local dried fruits and seafood in this province, taxed according to the originally promulgated regulations. (2) The various products listed in the preceding article, from June 1st of the 18th year of the Republic of China, will be taxed in accordance with the following regulations: A. A special tax on the above two items or on goods weighing one metric ton will be collected at the original tax rate; B. The tax on soybeans, peanuts, vegetable oil, coconut oil, and olive oil will be doubled from the original tax rate. The special tax on raw cakes and fruits will be increased by 20% of the original tax rate. C. The special taxes on electrical appliances, sandpaper, and dry batteries will all be increased by half of the original tax rate. D. For the special tax on imported sugar, foreign sugar (with trademarks, original color, and others) will be changed to 2.4 yuan in national currency per hundred catties, and the remaining sugar will be taxed according to the original tax rate. E. The special taxes on other imported products of various categories will be doubled from the original tax rate. F. The tax on the cosmetics and decorative articles in item B of the preceding article will be doubled from the original special tax rate for imported goods. G. The donations on local dried fruits and seafood in the above two items will be doubled from the original tax rate. H. Imported bar soap is listed under oils and taxed at 12 yuan per hundred catties. Foreign wax is listed under waxes and taxed at 18 yuan in national currency per hundred catties. Dried lychee and dried longan are listed under seafood and dried fruits and taxed at 1.6 yuan per hundred catties. I. For special taxes on goods levied ad valorem, if the tax exceeds 40% according to the standard of these tax rules, the tax rate will be calculated at 40%. (3) The following products are exempt from special taxes: A. Various machines for agricultural and industrial production; B. Various machines for medical institutions; C. Public goods for military and government agencies. (4) Various taxable products that were transported in before June 1st of the 28th year of the Republic of China but are reported for tax after the implementation of these tax rules will still be taxed according to these tax rules. (5) All taxable products transported and sold by public trading organizations and cooperatives must be taxed in accordance with these tax rules. (6) Matters concerning tax declaration, transit, and illegal penalties will still be handled in accordance with the originally promulgated regulations. (7) Cosmetics and decorative articles are consumables. At this time of increasingly tense resistance against Japan, it is imperative to accumulate financial resources to strengthen war resources. Therefore, cosmetics and decorative articles transported from other provinces should also be included in taxation and taxed at the rate of imported goods to comply with the central government's frugality policy. (8) Dried lychee, dried longan, and imported soap and candles are not necessities. Other similar items have been taxed separately, so they should all be included in the scope of taxation to ensure fairness. (9) The special tax on foreign sugar and imported sugar in this province was originally reduced to 6 jiao per hundred catties. Now, in order to protect local sugar, it is specifically changed to 2.4 yuan in national currency, and all other taxes are doubled.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Regulations for the Establishment of Tax Collection Offices in Various Counties Determined; County Magistrate Concurrently Serves as Director, Deputy Director Appointed by the Department; Previously Promulgated Tax Collection Regulations Are All Abolished <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Express News) In order to reorganize tax revenue, the Finance Department has established tax collection offices in various counties and drafted organizational regulations, which were approved at the 30th Provincial Affairs Conference.

<p>(Guangzhou Express News) Our guerrilla squads active in the suburbs of Guangzhou have repeatedly attacked Japanese troops. On the 28th, several dozen guerrillas from a certain unit gathered in a certain place near Nancun in Henan to hold a small group discussion meeting to discuss future strategies for annihilating the Japanese and to prepare to mobilize the local defense team in the southern district. That evening, it was reported that a small squad of Japanese troops, about a hundred or so men, had entered Guangzhou from Le Village. Our guerrilla squad immediately disguised themselves as peddlers and farmers, dispersing into smaller groups, and headed to Xiaogang Road. At 6 PM, the Japanese troops indeed passed through Xiaogang Road. Five of our guerrillas, carrying bamboo baskets on their shoulders, were the first to encounter the Japanese. Unexpectedly, the Japanese were cunning and, upon seeing them, immediately shouted for a search. Disregarding everything, our five brave men immediately pulled out their guns and opened fire on the Japanese, killing two Japanese soldiers on the spot. The other dispersed guerrillas, hearing the gunshots, also emerged from the fields and hills, surrounding the Japanese from all sides. The Japanese troops were caught by surprise and panicked. They resisted with their weapons, and the fighting lasted for about forty minutes, killing or wounding twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers. Since the objective had been achieved, our guerrillas automatically withdrew and returned to their base camp. The people in the Henan area, upon hearing the news, were extremely excited.</p>

<p>(Dongguan Special News) Liu Faquan, the commander of the Third Brigade of the Fourth-First District Column of the Guangdong Guerrilla Force, has been extremely active in carrying out anti-Japanese work since he was ordered to organize and establish the brigade headquarters. Recently, because Zhu Liu, the pseudo-chairman of the Maintenance Committee in Zhongtang, Dongguan County, colluded with the Japanese troops, acted as a henchman, and oppressed the people, his evil deeds were obvious. In order to kill one to warn a hundred and eliminate traitors, a commando team in plain clothes was dispatched the day before yesterday to sneak into Zhongtang and assassinate the traitor when the opportunity arose. Zhu Liu, the pseudo-chairman of the Maintenance Committee, and several Japanese soldiers were shot dead, and various documents attached to the Japanese were found on his body. The traitors were eliminated, and everyone who heard about it was overjoyed. The Japanese troops and traitors stationed in the Zhongtang area are extremely terrified and live in constant fear. In addition, a few days ago, more than ten Japanese troops in Humen took an electric boat to harass the Shexi sea area of Dongguan. Liu Faquan learned about this and immediately sent dozens of troops to attack them. When the Japanese boat docked and landed, they were immediately swept by light machine guns, and twelve Japanese soldiers, including Qi Gongzhi Gong and Zhigong, were killed. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled back to the boat. Documents and photos were found on the bodies of the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese in Humen were extremely frightened after hearing the news and have not dared to go out to harass the area in recent days.</p>

<p>(Changshabu Express News) There is no major engagement in the Jiangmen and Xinhui battles; the situation is temporarily calm. Our troops are taking steady steps and are still preparing to continue the attack. It has been found that the Japanese have sent so-called "sweeping squads" of more than ten to harass various villages, demanding the establishment of pseudo-associations and the registration of "good citizens." On the 29th, forty or fifty Japanese "sweeping squad" members took motorboats and landed at Lile, looting and raping women in the villages of Niugutun, Xinyuan, and Shenzhen. Seeing the Japanese troops' atrocities, the strong men of the village rose up in resistance and surrounded and attacked the Japanese, eventually defeating them and killing more than twenty Japanese soldiers. About a hundred of our villagers also sacrificed their lives. At 2 PM on the 30th, two Japanese motorboats, carrying more than twenty Japanese soldiers, traveled from Shadi to Qibao Village near Daze, attempting to spy on the rear of our position.

<p>(Shenzhen Express News) The Japanese troops on the south bank of the East River have recently built a large number of defensive fortifications in the strongholds of Guanlongtai and others, actively forcing our people into military service in the hope of solidifying their defenses. However, our troops are still advancing according to a consistent strategy, striving to ensure that the Japanese troops have no chance to breathe. There have been good gains in recent days. Our recent intelligence on the Japanese is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Massively Conscript Our People</p>
<p>According to intelligence, Japanese commanders Yukawa, Iijima, Taihei, Narahara, and others, stationed in Shilong, Guancheng, Taiping, and other places, convened a meeting at the Japanese Military Headquarters in Guancheng on the 30th of last month, attended by pseudo-county magistrate Zhang Guoxun, pseudo-administrative commissioner Li Guoren, and various puppet traitors, specifically to discuss methods of recruiting our people. It was decided to conscript our people in the name of forming an "advance team," with five to ten people from each village. The methods used were both enticement and coercion, with the pseudo-district and township chiefs responsible for the conscription. After training at the Japanese Military Headquarters, they would be sent to the front lines for combat. The people, after hearing the news, were greatly alarmed and tried to escape by all means.</p>
<p>Our Troops Prepare for Another Counterattack</p>
<p>Our current combat strategy does not focus on capturing points, but purely adopts a mobile approach, aiming to harass the Japanese troops and then annihilate them in a large-scale operation. The two attacks last month were implementations of this strategy. It has been received by phone from the front that our troops on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, Zhanglu Road, and Baotai Road lines received orders again yesterday to counterattack as the opportunity arises. On the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, our troops charged into Guanlong Station on the 31st, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese and destroying two Japanese artillery positions. The troops on the south bank of the East River are in high spirits and have great confidence in annihilating the Japanese.</p>

After searching everything, they released it. It was found that the ferry had been robbed twice before, and this was the third time. The total loss of passengers, goods, and fares amounted to 3,000 yuan. Afterwards, two Japanese speedboats drove to chase and search, but nothing was found.

<p>(Beijiang Express News) The Japanese troops on the North Route are being suppressed by our forces and have repeatedly attempted to break through, but due to our strong strength and solid line of defense, they have been defeated again and again and are feeling increasingly anxious. They are now sending large reinforcements, intending to make a final stand.</p>
<p>Reinforcing Northern Guangdong, Still Intending to Make a Stand</p>
<p>According to military intelligence, the Japanese troops on the North Route are trying to break the deadlock by sending reinforcements again. The right wing, Taipingchang Shangang, has been reinforced by more than 300 troops from the Katano unit. The front, the Hengtanjiang Village on the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, has also been reinforced by 400 to 500 troops, including about 200 cavalry, stationed in Longxiang, Tanzibeijiao, and the hills. They have been riding back and forth on the positions in recent days, showing signs of restlessness.</p>
<p>Large Amounts of Poison Gas Delivered to the Front Lines</p>
<p>In addition to sending large reinforcements to various points, the Japanese troops have also delivered large amounts of poison gas, preparing to use inhumane means to massacre our troops. It is reported that more than a dozen truckloads of poison gas were transported from Guangzhou on the 26th and 27th, mostly mustard gas, tear gas, and dumdum bullets. It was found that when the Japanese troops invaded Longkou on the 29th and were intercepted by our Peng Division, they suddenly used tear gas. More than a dozen of our soldiers were caught off guard and fainted on the spot. Fortunately, most were equipped with gas masks, which prevented them from being poisoned.</p>
<p>The Japanese Again Vow to Invade Juntian</p>
<p>The Japanese troops are accustomed to making alarming threats and have recently released all sorts of absurd rumors, vowing to invade Juntian. In recent days, they have sent aircraft to Guotai, Baini, Lianglong Market, and other places to distribute leaflets in an attempt to intimidate us. It is reported that the Zhao, Peng, and Li divisions of our defense forces have increased their forces and opened up Japanese ×××× belt, strengthening the defense and guarding against it. Ye, the deputy commander, has also instructed Wu Guanqi, the commander of the Second District Guerrilla Column, to intensify his activities and contain the rear of the Japanese troops.</p>

However, the Japanese are very vigilant and do not allow the islanders to approach, so the details are not known. Also, the Japanese camp near Huanzai Village was attacked by our guerrilla squad on the evening of the 21st, killing or wounding seven or eight Japanese soldiers. In a fit of rage, claiming that the village condoned the search for the guerrilla squad, and under the pretext of investigating traitors, they sent more than a hundred soldiers to the village to loot and set the entire village on fire on the 23rd of this month.

<p>(Beihai Express News) Beihai Customs issued a notice yesterday, stating that special local products subject to transit tax, if they are prepared to be re-exported to foreign countries, may be specially allowed to be repackaged, reorganized, or re-bundled, and still enjoy the benefits of re-exporting to offset taxes, but must meet the following conditions: (1) Apply for permission from the Customs; (2) The repackaging and other matters must be supervised by the Customs; (3) The form of the goods after repackaging should be detailed in the declaration form and approved by the Customs.

<p>(Beihai Express News) The Beihai Self-Defense Regiment has been preparing to establish a military preparation fund. Since there was no source of funds, the Hepu County Government had planned to levy an import and export tax on all sailboats and ships at a rate of 3 per thousand of the estimated value. However, the Beihai merchants believed that most of the goods transported by sailboats were for transshipment and still needed to be transferred to ships for export, which seemed to be a duplicate tax, so they expressed their disagreement. The county government has slightly revised the measures and tentatively plans to collect import and export taxes on ships only, with the tax rate still set at 3 per thousand of the customs estimate.</p>

<p>(Southern Guangdong Express) × is scheming to intensify its economic aggression against us, in coordination with its military operations. Within our occupied territories, it is actively selling × goods. In non-occupied areas, it instigates Chinese collaborators to find ways to smuggle them in. It has been discovered that three × merchant ships are currently docked in Haikou, Hainan, carrying large quantities of × goods for sale at high prices in Haikou, to extract money from our people. However, the people's property has long been plundered, and their purchasing power is extremely weak, making it impossible to sell the × goods. Recently, they have resorted to a trick, exploiting the fact that Xuwen is separated from Hainan Island by only a narrow strip of water and the distance is not far. They are inducing Chinese traitors and criminals to smuggle × goods into our interior, promoting sales in various counties of Southern Guangdong. This scheme has already been detected by our authorities, who have issued orders to all coastal counties to strictly inspect import and export trade. If any traitors are found smuggling enemy goods, they will be arrested and prosecuted without leniency.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Stalin and Chaplin <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— German Web</p>
<p>The works of the master of screen humor, Charlie Chaplin, have not been seen for a long time. Recently, Chaplin personally took action because many ambitious countries were arbitrarily bullying the weak and disregarding justice and reason. He starred in the film *The Dictator*. The film depicts a vagrant who is imprisoned in a German concentration camp. Later, because the vagrant looks very much like the current German leader Hitler, some nervous friends mistakenly believe he is Hitler and ask him to come out safely. Afterwards, he makes the most of the mistake and creates many hilarious jokes.</p>
<p>Since the news of Chaplin's production of *The Dictator* reached the Soviet Union, the Central Film Committee of the Soviet Union has decided to award Chaplin the Red Banner of Labor Order to show their encouragement. At the same time, the Soviet Union's supreme leader Stalin also issued an order to the whole country, ordering all theaters to unanimously show Chaplin's films for a week, starting on Chaplin's 50th birthday on the 16th of last month, to commemorate him. Because Chaplin is not just an entertainer from Hollywood, he is a powerful figure who uses film to resist capitalism and the bourgeoisie. His broken boots, gourd belly, and old cane are truly the best magic weapons for consolidating democratic politics by striking at totalitarian politics. Therefore, all people in countries that love freedom and peace should pay him the highest respect.</p>

<p>The news that the quintuplet sisters would meet the King and Queen of England during their tour of Canada had been spread beforehand. Finally, on the 22nd, the five sisters met the King and Queen. The meeting place was in the Parliament of Toronto, Ontario. King George and Queen Elizabeth broke the British royal family's precedent by giving the five sisters five wet kisses in the reception room.</p>
<p>That day, the five sisters wore dresses that were short to the knees, which was a kind of ceremonial dress. They wore brimless straw hats on their heads, which made them look especially lively and cute.</p>
<p>The viewing ceremony lasted for 19 minutes. Dr. Dafoe, who has been in charge of the five sisters since they were born, called out their names one by one, and they met the King and Queen. Each of the five girls, upon hearing their name, very respectfully and carefully walked to the King and Queen and saluted.</p>
<p>After this simple ceremony, the five sisters were entertained by the King and Queen and were allowed to move around the room as they pleased. Cecile was the first to cross the reception room and kiss the Queen. Then her sisters, seeing Cecile doing this, surrounded the Queen and competed to be the first to kiss the Queen. The Queen was very happy to see the enthusiasm of these five little girls and held them in her arms one by one, kissing them in turn.</p>
<p>At that time, King George, in this situation, was so surrounded by the girls that he forgot everything. It was not until Yvonne untangled the situation that he woke up. She walked up to the King, took his hand, and stroked it. The King leaned over as if to say something softly in her ear, and they all laughed.</p>
<p>Marie, seeing her sister playing with the man in the sailor suit for too long, walked over and gave a bouquet of flowers to the King. As for the other four sisters, they all gave their bouquets of flowers to the Queen.</p>

<p>(Shaoguan Express) Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun believes that since the opium addiction treatment hospitals in various counties and cities have been accommodating addicts for treatment, many addicts have been successfully cured and discharged from the hospital. However, after the addicts are discharged, due to their poor environment, many have relapsed. This situation makes it difficult to completely eradicate opium addiction. In order to thoroughly eradicate it and provide addicts with proper jobs to maintain their livelihoods after they are discharged, it is planned that the provincial government will allocate funds to establish a Qiangmin Factory to accommodate addicts who have been discharged from the opium addiction treatment hospitals in various counties and cities to work in the factory. Chairman Li has ordered the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Department of Construction, and other agencies to handle this matter jointly. The three agencies have now sent staff to jointly plan and prepare the budget for the project. After submitting it to the provincial government for review, it can be implemented step by step. It is said that the scale of the Qiangmin Factory is quite large. All wartime industries and military production are planned to be carried out in the future. In addition, He Tong, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, in order to actively promote the anti-opium policy and eradicate opium addiction, believes that many unregistered addicts have been overlooked in various counties and should be registered to accommodate as many addicts as possible for treatment in the hospital. It is specifically decided that the registration of overlooked addicts will be carried out from the 1st to the 30th of this month, and the registration method has been drafted and promulgated to various counties to be carried out on schedule. Yesterday, Chen Zhiming and others were dispatched to various counties to be responsible for supervising the addicts' registration and inspecting the anti-opium policies in various counties.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Public Baseball League: Hong Kong Club to Play Friends Beer; Both Sides Have Strong Strength and a Fierce Battle Is Expected <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) In the past two or three weeks, it has rained almost every day, and good sports fields have been repeatedly affected. Taking the public baseball league as an example, there have been as many as six games postponed due to rain, which is very disappointing for the fans.</p>
<p>If it is sunny today, there will be a baseball game at the Royal Naval Ground on Caroline Hill at 2:30 pm, with the Hong Kong Club playing the Friends Beer team.</p>
<p>Friends Beer initially won against the Western Club and then defeated the Mindanao team, and then became known as a strong team. The team was originally a transformed version of the unremarkable Volunteer Army from last year. However, due to diligent practice recently, the skills of each player have greatly improved, so they have won two games in a row and become a powerful contender for the championship in the future.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Club has many good players joining, and the lineup has been renewed. Judging from the team's fierce battle against the Chinese team last month, although they were defeated, they posed a great threat to the Chinese team. In the fifth inning, they even took a 6-4 lead. However, they were unable to sustain their strength and collapsed, allowing the Chinese team to seize the final victory. However, the team is still a strong force, and its strong fighting power is enough to compete with any team.</p>
<p>Today, when Friends Beer plays against the Hong Kong Club, most people will predict that Friends Beer will win, but I dare not make a judgment in advance, because Friends Beer has a half a catty, and the Hong Kong Club also has eight taels. Moreover, the Hong Kong Club players' batting skills are no worse than those of the opponent, but their defensive coordination seems to be less meticulous than that of the opponent.</p>
<p>If the Hong Kong Club players pay attention to the defensive aspects and reduce mistakes, it will make the opponent feel uneasy to reach the base.</p>
<p>The pitcher is the soul of a team. If a pitcher has good skills, the team has a higher hope of winning. Friends Beer pitcher Xia Gaoli has very good skills, but he cannot last a long time. After the fourth or fifth inning, his pitching power feels weakened. Hong Kong Club pitcher Luo Lanshi also has this shortcoming, but his technique does not seem to be as unique as Xia Gaoli's. Therefore, Friends Beer is more likely to win.</p>
<p>However, the key to victory in baseball is not just one pitcher. The most important thing is the cooperation of the whole team. If their cooperation is effective and their communication is consistent, they are not far from victory.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Club's communication does not seem to be as good as that of Friends Beer, but when competing, it is difficult for anyone to guarantee that there will be no mistakes. If Friends Beer is a little careless and gives people a chance, it is not surprising that there will be unexpected results. In short, this game is worth watching. The player lists for both sides are as follows: (</p>

<p>[Reuters News Agency, New York, 2nd] A heavyweight boxing match of fifteen rounds was held here last night. Young talent Rowan knocked down Bell in the eleventh round. Bell weighed two hundred and ten and a quarter pounds, and Luo weighed two hundred and two pounds.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was extremely cold during the competition, and there were 25,000 spectators. Famous boxers Dempsey, Tanglai, and Joe Louis were all present to watch.</p>
<p>Before the competition, it was estimated that Rowan had an eleven to ten chance of winning.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, Rowan immediately used both fists to win the first round. Bell committed an illegal act, and the referee issued a warning to him, but Rowan was not affected.</p>
<p>In the second round, the two sides fought fiercely against each other. Bell's movements were very barbaric, and he repeatedly scolded Rowan. Bell won this round.</p>
<p>The third round ended in a draw. In the fourth round, Bell made another wrong punch. The two sides held their fists together for readjustment. Bell won this round.</p>
<p>In the fifth round, both men showed fatigue. Blood dripped from Bell's mouth, but he still tried his best to win. In the fifth and sixth rounds, Rowan appeared to be in a difficult situation, but in the seventh round, he recovered and made many good punches, winning both the seventh and eighth rounds. Bell's mouth and eyes were injured, blood was gushing from his mouth, and his eyes were closed. Rowan took the upper hand and hit his opponent with many heavy punches.</p>
<p>In the tenth round, Bell's mouth was even more injured and it was difficult for him to resist Rowan's fierce attack. At the beginning of the eleventh round, the referee asked Bell if he could continue fighting. Bell said he could. The two sides fought again, for about one minute and twenty-one seconds. The referee then announced the end of the battle, and Bell, covered in blood, was unable to continue fighting.</p>

<h3 id="e72">The Responsibility of Football Players <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, there must be the authority to command the entire team. If a certain player's position is inappropriate, or if a pass or kick is illegal, corrections can be made at any time. When a forward enters the opposing team's penalty area, the center back should follow and wait outside the enemy's forward line. If the ball is returned by the enemy, it can be sent back into the penalty area at any time. If the defensive strength of an area is weak, one should rush to the open space to fill the gap, or have one of the two midfielders replace them to defend. The two midfielders are like the two arms of the center back. Ideally, they should act according to the center back's intentions, going left when desired, going right when desired, fully assisting left and right. When the team's forwards are attacking, one should always leave a player to connect with the two fullbacks to solidify the defense. The position of this remaining midfielder is behind the center back and in front of the two fullbacks, forming a triangle. Even if the forward attack is unsuccessful and the ball is intercepted by the opponent, the three fullbacks will not be in any danger.</p>
<p>Regarding the three-fullback formation, which is commonly used in modern England, the responsibility of the two midfielders is to monitor the enemy's two wings and two inside forwards, cutting off their connection. If the opponent's two wings have excellent individual skills, the two midfielders can devote all their efforts to dealing with them. The positions of midfielders and fullbacks are different, and their work also differs accordingly. When a fullback gets the ball, they often don't have time to consider and simply kick the ball out, which is considered fulfilling their responsibility. However, it is not the same for a midfielder to get the ball. When someone is blocking, they must quickly pass the ball to a teammate. If no one is intercepting, they must dribble the ball forward calmly. Only when an enemy approaches should they pass to a teammate in the best position. After the opponent or the team kicks the ball out of bounds, the midfielder is responsible for throwing the ball and fighting for possession. When the forwards' attack is unsuccessful and the ball is intercepted by the opponent, it is a kind of feeling for the midfielders of this side. If the pass is accurate and quick as lightning, the second attack will surely succeed. However, the passing midfielder, who bears the great responsibility for victory or defeat, should first examine which of the team's forwards is in the most advantageous position and then pass to that player. Avoid the common habit of the left midfielder only passing the ball to the left winger and the right midfielder only passing to the right inside forward and right winger, thus losing the opportunity.</p>

<p>— Zhang Dechang</p>
<p>At that time, governments of various countries used loans and subsidies to support small farmers and develop cooperative undertakings to prevent small farmers from being exploited by middlemen. Germany and Russia even carried out large-scale political reforms of the land situation. They used low-cost railway transportation policies to facilitate the distribution of agricultural products and tariff policies to protect rural areas. Even the United States, a country rich in agricultural products, also adopted political methods to resist the intrusion of Canadian agricultural products. In terms of industry, the government stipulated various laws to restrict industrial mergers, protect industrial workers, train unskilled workers, and improve production capacity. The state not only passively managed but also gradually established government-run industries. Initially, these included military factories and other industries related to war. Railway machinery factories in countries with state-owned railways were naturally state-run. Some industries were managed by the state, but also used subsidies to encourage private capital to create them. The state could manage them. For example, Russia's steel industry was created under the favorable conditions of heavy government subsidies. Germany's shipbuilding industry was also successfully assisted by the government through political means. As for transportation undertakings, the relationship with the state was even more direct. In countries where railways were privately owned, governments such as those of Britain and France gradually gained regulatory power. Apart from capital organization, technology occupies an important position in all economic undertakings. If one only focuses on private individuals to research and individual factories and stores to train workers, the scope of impact will be very small. Since the 19th century, countries have played a significant role in this regard. Research institutions and educational institutions were mostly established or facilitated by the government. We can say that without the various actions of political intervention in economic undertakings since the 19th century, modern economic undertakings would not have the development they have today. Therefore, the relationship between the nation and economic undertakings has been the closest since the 19th century. The power of political intervention in economic undertakings has increased and its scope has expanded, which is the first foundation for the emergence of modern controlled economies and planned economies.</p>
<p>The European War, which lasted for four years, further advanced state management of economic undertakings and opened up a new situation. During the European War, both sides of the belligerent countries strictly controlled economic undertakings, and there is no need to elaborate on the details. We will simply explain two points. First, during these four years of war, the government's power to control economic undertakings expanded to the maximum extent. A report from the British wartime cabinet stated: "The vast majority of people serve the public directly or indirectly. In addition to soldiers and officials, some are engaged in agriculture, some in manufacturing, and others are devoted to organizing, transferring, and distributing undertakings. All production institutions have been taken over by the government from private hands, including railways, shipping, coal, iron, engineering manufacturing, and raw materials, food, and charcoal, etc. The government must not only be responsible for raising enough but also be responsible for managing them so that both individuals and the state benefit. The government must also manage prices, suppress excessive profits, control spending, set maximum prices, and manage import and export trade. In short, all consumption, production, and related undertakings have been subjected to government control for the first time. Because of this war, the state's social and administrative organization has undergone a major change. Many of these changes cannot be altered in the future." Since the government manages various economic undertakings, the pre-war government organization was not sufficient to cope with this major responsibility. Therefore, the second point we must pay attention to is the expansion of the organization along with the expansion of government functions. The British government hired more than 230,000 people, large and small, during the war. The situation was the same in various belligerent countries. The government became the largest employer for the first time. Although these four years of measures were wartime situations, they left a deep impression on people's minds. The state's control of economic undertakings has had several years of practical experience, achieving the most effective and reasonable results. This shows that economic undertakings should be planned under the unified planning of a national government, which is the second foundation for modern controlled economies and planned economies.</p>
<p>Modern controlled economies and planned economies take this foundation as a precedent in order to build a new economic system to replace the private economic system. We do not need to mention their theories here. However, there are two points we want to bring up: first, there is an overall plan under one government; second, the government's organization is changed and expanded to implement this plan. The current government's organization cannot handle the heavy responsibilities.</p>
<p>The management of economic undertakings with political power has now become an established trend. However, the nature of the problem is different for a country with an existing industrial base and a country that is not industrialized. For the former, the most important issue is how to transfer private production undertakings to the state. In these countries, industrialists, merchants, and landlords have deep-rooted forces. The social resistance is very large. However, even in these countries, the goal of state-owned enterprises can be achieved through peaceful means. For an industrially backward country, the problem is much simpler. For example, China does not have large industrial and commercial forces. The only cumbersome problem is the land problem. In other aspects, no private economic force is greater than the government. The government is the largest capitalist and the largest employer. At the same time, only the government is the largest organization for recruiting technical personnel and training technical institutions. It is much easier and more convenient to develop economic undertakings with political power. Whether in wartime or after the war, China's industrial problems must be determined by the solution of capital and technology problems. Speaking of capital and technology, besides the government, what private force can be compared with it?</p>

<h3 id="e79">Miscellaneous Writings from Western Hunan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>(II) Women and Baskets</p>
<p>The women of western Hunan are more special than women in other parts of China. Ninety percent of them are working women. Whether in work or at home, they bear twice as much work as men. Taking Yuanling as an example, this is even more evident. In Yuanling, about one-fifth or more of the men smoke opium. They don't care about anything and sit at home all day. All household affairs and production are supported by women. Only when they are in a bad mood or feel that the material supply is not enough do they scold their wives or daughters. Besides that, the only thing they do is go to tea houses to chat.</p>
<p>The women, from the age of seven or eight, are trained in the skill of climbing mountains. On their shoulders, they carry a "wastepaper basket"-like basket, step by step, up and down. They are trained like this until they are old and can no longer carry heavy loads, and only then do they break away from the basket.</p>
<p>The basket has many uses. It is usually used to carry firewood, rice, and even heavier boxes and packages. They often transport goods for shops and carry luggage for guests. Thirty or forty pounds of things in the basket are very easy for them. In addition, the basket has a major use, which is to put children who cannot walk yet in the basket and take them up the mountains and down to the fields. During hard work, the child's swaying little hands and sweet and tender voice can give the mother infinite comfort.</p>
<p>The women's physique is mostly strong and robust, and their skin is rough and slightly yellowish-brown. Yes, in addition to being battered by the sun and rain every day, they also suffer from the ravages of childbirth and the various abuses given by their husbands and families.</p>
<p>When every outsider first arrives in Yuanling, they will think, "Since women can produce everyone, their status in the family must be very high." But the facts tell us that this is not the case. After a girl is born, she grows slowly in neglect and contempt. When she is able to walk steadily and climb high, the basket begins to form a deep relationship with her. The basket seems to be their destiny—their inescapable and painful destiny. Later, according to their age and family circumstances, the increase or decrease of labor is determined. After growing up, like the women oppressed by the feudal forces everywhere, they are married off by their parents in a semi-sale-like manner. After that, they bear heavier labor and suffer more complex mental pain.</p>
<p>The average number of women in western Hunan who have the opportunity to be educated is less than one or two out of a hundred, so it can be said that they are completely uneducated. The first reason, of course, is that the people of western Hunan are generally poor and it is not easy to provide for their children to go to school. The second reason is that they despise girls and are deeply poisoned by the idea that "lack of talent is a virtue for women." The opportunity for women to seek knowledge is completely deprived.</p>
<p>They cannot let women have knowledge, cannot let them know this society, and cannot let them know humanity. If they understand everything, how can they endure the shackles of the feudal forces? ... Under this clever method of rule, Chinese women have sacrificed infinite life and energy. The working women of western Hunan are continuing to sacrifice under heavier persecution. This is a painful thing!</p>
<p>Workers in the women's liberation movement and workers mobilizing the masses should pay close attention to this issue and properly guide the strength of Chinese women into the overall strength of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>... Liberate the painful destiny of the women of western Hunan and unload the unreasonable burden on their backs. Their strong bodies still have to carry heavy loads, but what they carry is not the cruel pressure of feudalism, but the common destiny of every person in the Chinese nation in the war of resistance!</p>
<p>(III) An Example</p>
<p>Since western Hunan is so important in terms of national defense, but the people's lives are so difficult and the culture is so backward, these are all very serious problems in the overall war of resistance. If we want to promote victory in the war of resistance, then how to improve people's lives and how to promote mass mobilization work has become the most urgent need. The old couple in the Chenxi Land Temple, I think this is the best example for our reflection...</p>
<p>Outside the west gate, turning from the main street into Mafangjie and running all the way up the mountain, halfway up the mountain, you can see a Land Temple hidden by the roadside. It is so old and gray, with ash and dirt piled up on both sides. No one burns incense, and there are no inscriptions. It is a humble and dirty place that has been completely forgotten.</p>
<p>The only ones who have developed a friendship with that small ancient temple and cannot leave it for a day are an old beggar couple over seventy years old. They have lived there for more than ten years, it is said. In front of the Land Temple, which is four feet wide, the old beggars each occupy a space, so passers-by especially feel that this place is narrow ... Moreover, in the spring, the old people's space exudes a musty smell, and in the winter, they burn garbage and grass that they pick up everywhere, and the five surrounding military camps can smell the burnt smell.</p>
<p>Because I have to pass by that Land Temple every day for office work, the two abandoned old people are always lying on their indescribably filthy space, moaning like pigeons. Their faces are like ancient pottery just excavated from the ground, and their gray hair and facial features are almost mixed together.</p>
<p>"Are you local people?" One day, I asked the man.</p>
<p>The old man stared at me for a while before nodding.</p>
<p>"Is she your woman?" I squatted down and pointed at the old woman. She was facing the wall, moaning and sobbing in the cold.</p>
<p>"No," the old man replied.</p>
<p>But when I pressed him, he slyly said:</p>
<p>"In short, she is my woman, that's it. I forgot who she is to me." He turned his head to ask the old woman, "Hey, are you eight years younger than me?"</p>
<p>The old woman impatiently kept her face against the wall and said:</p>
<p>"Uh, I have eight fewer cold days than you, that's it. I don't know what a year is!"</p>
<p>The old man didn't speak and lowered his head to play with the burnt fuel. I was afraid that the old woman would get angry and didn't dare to talk to her, so I quietly asked the old man:</p>
<p>"Hey! Has the enemy's plane been to Yuanling? "He didn't answer me, so I continued to ask him:</p>
<p>"Do you hate the Japanese? They have driven millions of us out of our homes!"</p>
<p>What kind of × person's plane? What Japanese? Sir, where are you from? - Why are you asking me these things? I don't know anything. It's just that many outsiders have come to Yuanling in the past six months, and when the whistle blows, they rush to the top of the mountain. The world is a bit dreamy. There weren't so many people before. Is there some kind of disaster outside? Are the robbers driving people here?" (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Random Thoughts on Writing Practice <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Hong</p>
<p>The reason why works since the War of Resistance are "all the same," according to theorists, is due to the author's lack of deep engagement with life. I think this statement is correct, but on the other hand, readers also find the works to be technically immature. Unstable living conditions and the shortness of writing time can naturally be a reason, but we should not be satisfied with this reason unless we do not want to improve.</p>
<p>The same subject matter can produce works of different styles. This is the characteristic of literature as a form of storytelling. Writing is not formulaic; on the contrary, it is incredibly diverse. The formation of formalism is the fault of poor writing. Emptiness of content needs to be remedied by a deeper engagement with life; technical immaturity needs to be addressed through learning and cultivation. A good author uses his colored art brush to depict moving stories and has his own unique style.</p>
<p>The quality of works is generally judged by the content - at least recent commentators focus on this. From a historical standpoint and from a practical standpoint, we cannot deny this standard. Even if some people disagree, they can only sigh and say that this is an inevitable existence. Resisting the tide of the times will inevitably lead to destruction. An artistic conscience must be accompanied by an unavoidable prerequisite, which is fidelity to the times. Surely no one will raise objections?</p>
<p>In order to more clearly reflect the content, in order to have a moving force, and in order to achieve the artistic purpose - art should have a purpose, right? As people say, "All human endeavors, to prevent them from becoming empty and useless, must serve the interests of mankind." Therefore, we need skilled writing techniques. We are not formalists, not adherents of technical supremacy, and we know that a gorgeous tailcoat cannot hide ugliness even when worn on a scarecrow. But in view of the current phenomenon, it is necessary to remind every author of the need to strive to learn techniques. Because literature is art and nothing else.</p>
<p>But, it should be stated that the so-called technique is not the accumulation of flowery words. The accumulation of beautiful phrases. Literature is not word games, and superficial skills are worthless. The vivid description of images is alive. The characterization of people, the expression of the environment, the description of the atmosphere... can never be achieved by tossing around a few phrases. Therefore, we must always use our own observation and develop our own imagination. Therefore, the learning of techniques is mainly through reading the works of literary giants, but it is still related to life.</p>
<p>Someone said, "Writing is also a matter of life practice." The reason is probably here.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Miscellaneous Thoughts: Two Themes <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Nidi</p>
<p>1.  A Song</p>
<p>In the front building lives the young daughter of my relatives. Tonight, she is again singing "When Will You Return?"</p>
<p>I had been so disturbed by this song that my mood was unusually uneasy, and I shed tears of anger several times. Tonight, I know that I will undoubtedly suffer from insomnia. Ah, this terrible song!</p>
<p>With a round little face, she is an innocent and ignorant elementary school student. I usually like her very much, but when she starts singing this song, I extremely detest her, especially the round little face that I like.</p>
<p>Her teachers are probably using "When Will You Return?" as musical material to teach.</p>
<p>Children are ignorant, and I feel lost.</p>
<p>Save the children.</p>
<p>2.  The Third Kind of People</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai is even more special.</p>
<p>But I am not pessimistic; on the contrary, I am somewhat excited.</p>
<p>There are so-called third kind of people in the world, neither revolutionary nor counter-revolutionary. They have nothing to do with politics. But are they really unrelated to politics? A fool's dream! Bah!</p>
<p>However, such people exist in Shanghai. Currently, they are probably the third kind of people who neither resist the war nor oppose resisting the war.</p>
<p>But high pressure is coming, and they will not be able to justify themselves.</p>
<p>Will the fox's tail eventually be revealed one day?</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Stupidity of Seagulls <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>According to old sailors, when seagulls see a ship in the vast ocean, they desperately chase after it. If they cannot catch up, and there is no place to rest along the way, they have no choice but to fall into the sea and die.</p>
<p>Old sailors say this, and most people who blindly worship heroes, especially poets, praise seagulls, saying that they are truly brave, and are not afraid of sacrifice in order to achieve their goals. If people were as brave as they are, the world would be more progressive.</p>
<p>I do not think so. The actions of seagulls are just a brute force. Not only are they not brave, but also stupid. They see a ship and want to chase it, but I cannot see what their legitimate purpose is. Maybe they think the ship will give them some comfort, but the ship ignores them. Perhaps they can get some rest on the top of the mast, but the ship will immediately drive them away. Maybe they want to express some threat to the ship, but the ship's response is a burst of bullets. Futile and unrewarding, this is nothing but stupidity.</p>
<p>As for not being able to catch up with the ship, and therefore dying from exhaustion, we can't find a second word to describe them other than "extremely stupid."</p>
<p>Originally, kites fly in the sky and fish leap in the deep. The world is vast, and everyone is free. Ships do not hinder seagulls, and seagulls do not have to hinder ships. If seagulls want to show off their strength, they will only bring about their own destruction.</p>
<p>I think if seagulls were not so ignorant, they might regret this unnecessary action!</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Iron Flood <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Shengdan</p>
<p>— War Zone Notes</p>
<p>The Prelude to the Army-Civilian Joint Celebration Opens</p>
<p>On the riverside square, torches are burning brightly, and the music plays a march. Thus, the firelight and singing break through the silence of the night, causing the surrounding mountains to immediately tremble, and the river roars continuously. The crowded and bustling people surge like waves. Even the places far away from the stage are full of people: men, women, old, and young, holding hands and arms, all watching the actions on the stage.</p>
<p>"Defend our motherland!"</p>
<p>The same loud sound moved the hearts of all the people in the audience. This was the roar of Division Commander Fang at the end of his speech. He is indeed a talented orator. Every word and every phrase can strike people's hearts and make countless listeners listen attentively. Usually, when he instructs the soldiers, his solemn attitude, strong tone, and clear words move people to tears. I remember in Liguo, he once persuaded the local famous bandits to surrender. In the Battle of Taierzhuang, the home-wrecking and bandit king actually led a platoon of brothers into the enemy's artillery position and single-handedly killed eleven people in one breath. However, after returning to the team with injuries, he died due to the bursting of the wound! Therefore, even during the "rushed and busy" times of war, he did not neglect political work at all. "In the near future, the Dabie Mountains will surely erupt in flames. Now is the last period for spreading the fire. Tuanfeng is especially important. If new life is not injected into each village as soon as possible, then no matter how dangerous Songziguan is, the enemy can easily cross it!" He solemnly described the meaning and purpose of the army-civilian joint celebration.</p>
<p>When the program proceeded to the chorus of the Chaonan War Zone Singing Troupe, the audience almost did not even make a sound of sighing. What they had was a magnificent voice, and earth-shattering applause. After that, there was a torchlight parade. Within three minutes, thousands of torches were lit together, and the raging flames were soaring. "A symbol of light!" everyone shouted like this, and happy smiles appeared on their faces.</p>
<p>The leader was a local 67-year-old farmer. His white hair was fluttering in the wind, but his spirit was very full. The cow that was bombed to death during the day was his "old long-term worker." "Although it is a beast, I will avenge it!" he said. At the beginning of the parade, he volunteered to lead the vast team, starting from the square, with the torches shining so brightly, passing through this village and that village, covering the mountains and fields like a living fire dragon.</p>
<p>This is the expression of power and the iron flood!</p>
