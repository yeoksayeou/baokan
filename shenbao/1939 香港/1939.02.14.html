<p>社評</p>
<h3>各國對×侵海南島應有的注意</h3>
<p>日×佔領海南島巳引起了國際很大的波動，各國輿論界已紛紛加以報道與評論，我國各報也有深刻的分析。但据我們的意見，這個問題的核心，主要的在於日本軍閥對國內各方面注意之轉移和對國際動向的試探。因此，對於這一問題，在我們的立場上，應該集中力量來如何分析日×此舉對於英美法的影響，並對英美法各國應該如何表示確切的希望。關於前一點，本報連日已作扼要的剖述，茲就後一點，再抒所見如下：</p>
<p>日×在海南島登陸企圖加以佔領，對於英美法的影響，與前此十八個月的戰爭對於英美法的影響，字全不同，以前的影響只限於經濟權益，此次則爲各國的軍事問題；以前只限於中國國內的範圍，這次則爲太平洋乃至全世界的範圍。這點應該先加承認。但更重要的一點，是日×此次的行動是很顯明地暗中得到德意帮兇的指使的；其目的不只在於威脅英法，並且是在威脅美國。當西班牙叛軍一時勝利的成果，意大利企圖獨佔而英法加以强硬阻止的今日，又當日水侵略戰爭已達「掛形」的階段需要更大國際變化來承接其開展的今日，日本軍閥接受德意的要求以爲締結軍事三角同盟的條件，是很自然的趨向。因此，日方派遣海陸軍及外務省的代表赴歐參加柏林的某種重要會議，目的在於將反共協定改爲德意日三國的正式軍事同盟的消息，是十二分可靠的。據說，日本原意，是欲以蘇聯爲攻擊目標，但是德意則堅持須將英法美三國包括在內。這更是値得注意的消息，日軍在海南島登陸，更不是偶然的事情。</p>
<p>我們更要提醒國內外人士注意的一點，日本海軍力量是相當薄弱的，並不像米內日海相所　的雄厚，所以在將來的海戰上，或許可能地注重于海上游擊戰，以擾亂英美法的巨大艦隊。但爲實施海上游擊戰，須有適當的陸上的根據地，所以日本海軍省强調太平洋海軍根據地的建設，但是本年度海軍軍費的特別預算却是相當小的數目，預料日海軍的作法當不外乎進一步佔領我國沿海的幾個據點，以補救缺欠巨型戰艦的弱點。海南島之佔據的主要用意即在於此，可見日×舉完全是準備太平洋大戰的積極工作；倘若英法美不能採强硬態度此，以阻止其鋒鋩，則日海軍或有再進一步侵佔其他沿海據點以爲將來海戰根據地的可能，而英美法在太平洋上的力量完全被限制到極小限度。海南島的問題幾可說是日本對英美法的海軍前哨戰的發動，所以蔣委員長對外報記者直言：此事爲太平洋上的「九一八」，乃日軍南進之發難。</p>
<p>英美法各國更應注意的一點，是日×此次行動仍不過是一種試探，一方面聲援德意，一方面則爲窺探英法及美國的態度，乃至對太平洋戰爭的决心及力量，我們爲英美法設想，應該立刻堅持海南島不能佔領的條約根據，強硬反對日本，直至日海軍退出該島爲止，一些消息及某些大報評斷英法或將仍舊不出抗議，就問題的重大性看來，英法政府或者不至於這樣輕視。我們認爲英法應該有相當的切實的打算，美國更須對英法加以積極的聲援。英法對日質問此種佔領爲永久的呢，抑爲暫時的呢？這是一種很大的失策。我們應該認識病入肺病第三期的侵略者慣用的手段，是恫赫，以期不戰而獲勝利。德國在歐洲的勝利，日本依然在羨慕不置，即令最近對中國的恫嚇失敗了，但對國際仍不能放棄這種技倆。英法美能相繼強硬，日本侵略者必無以自存。英法在太平洋的軍事根据，只有强硬的辦法可把持住；美國在太平洋上的海軍根据地的建設，不能單靠軍事工程，還需要積極外交及經済政策來協助。</p>
<p>日×占領海南島對中國關係小，對英美法關系大，希望各國加考慮！</p>
<h3>向戰爭邁進的過及形勢</h3>
<p>— 孫德華</p>
<p>一，戰爭在推進中</p>
<p>慕尼黑協定以後的國際政治有兩個基本方向，一個方向是德·意法西斯蒂與英，法金融資本集團之繼續調協，反對自家國民的利益，反對弱小民族與弱小國家，反對國際勞工運動，反對民主政治，反對社會主　的蘇聯，反對反戰反法西斯的世界和平運動與和平陣綫的開展，另一個方向是國際工人統一戰綫的各國人民反對慕尼黑協定，反對法西斯的侵略，保衛世圾和平的聯合戰綫的運動，前一方向將使人民大衆與弱小國家民族受到奴役、將使帝國主義戰爭更加肆虐，使世界大戰向史大規模爆發的危機更加迫近，後一方向將使人民大衆與弱小國家民族得到自由獨立解放，制裁與戰勝法西斯侵略者，保證世界的和平。</p>
<p>然而，目前的國際形勢，尤其是巴薩龍納與整個加泰隆尼亞失陷以後的形勢，使更大規模戰爭爆發的危機更加緊迫了，世界形勢是向戰爭前途推進着，在廣泛的地區上爆發世界性的戰爭，將是很難避免的事實。</p>
<p>戰爭之迫近與難于避免，是資本主義發展的必然結果，帝國主義不平衡性的發展，要將已往分割的世界，用軍事衝突與戰禍的方式來舉行再分割，日·德·意已經進行了和進行着反對中國，奧大利，捷克，阿比西尼亞·及西班牙人民的戰爭，現在更　備進行掠奪其他弱小國家及殖民地的戰爭，更凖備進行反對英，法，美等强國利益的戰爭。</p>
<p>戰爭之迫近與難于避免、是慕尼黑協定給了德、意、日法西斯侵略者以很大的鼓勵、使他們佔有了更强大的陣地、蓄積更多的力量、來繼續進行更瘋狂的侵略，</p>
<p>戰爭之迫近與難于避免、是英，法金融資本集團「現實主義」的必然結果，「現實主義」只有使法西斯侵略者的食慾更加擴大，掠奪殖民地的要求與行動史加急亟，侵略的刀鋒更加對準「現實主義」的主人。</p>
<p>戰爭之迫近與難于避免，是第二國際的好些領袖們仍未能誠心誠意的執行反戰反法西斯的人民陣綫的戰略，使國際勞工團結統一的力量，使世界和平陣綫的力量，還未足够去及時壓止法西斯的進攻。</p>
<p>戰爭的危機更加迫近了，它將不滿足于目前的局部的地區，它將在世界規模上出現，當德，意·日法西斯侵略的鐵蹄踏上了非英法所能忍讓的程度時，大戰就不能不爆發，這個戰爭旣不會是純粹的帝國主義戰爭，也不能是帝國主義反蘇聯的戰爭，而是兩條陣綫的戰爭，是和平陣綫與侵略陣綫的戰爭。</p>
<p>二，侵略陣線的瘋狂</p>
<p>侵略者的食慾是不能饜止的，慕尼黑協定更加壯大了德，意，日的阻量，更鼓勵了德，意，日的侵略暴行，使德，意，日在進行更瘋狂的進攻。</p>
<p>侵略者首先鞏固起已得的陣地，德國從經濟上政治上軍事上逐漸把握了整個捷克，意大利鞏固阿比西尼亞與西叛軍佔領地，日本企圖鞏固在中國的佔領地，拚命進行「僞中央政權」的組織、要建立「東亞新秩序」與組『日滿支集團』，而且企圖獨佔中國的利益，排斥英，美，法等國在華權利，如統制華北航業，設立華中「興亞院」，封鎖長江等。</p>
<p>侵略者隨着便擴大其進攻範圍，德國挑動各小國法西斯力量蠢動，壓服立陶宛在事實上統制了美米爾，壓迫丹麥的塞勒斯維格，威迫荷蘭，波蘭，以經濟力量利誘匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞與土耳其，企圖復活其「三B政策」，煽動巴力斯坦的騷亂，加强南非的活動，强硬提出殖民地的要求，意大利動員更多的陸海空軍去反對西班牙的人民，壓迫瑞士，配合德國來利誘羅馬尼亞與南斯拉夫，企圖控制巴爾幹半島，陳兵北非威嚇英，法，提出殖民地要求，幷向法國强索突尼斯與科西加，日本進攻華南，窺伺海南島，和擴大在南洋羣島與太平洋上的陰謀活動，德，意，日三個國家更聯同的在美洲特別是南美洲進行法西斯的陰謀，德，意，日的侵略要重新瓜分殖民地，瘋其狂的刀鋒，正向準英，法，美的利益。</p>
<p>因此，侵略者三個國家就感覺有進一步聯結由防共協定進爲軍事同盟的必要，德，意，日軍事同盟的消息，雖然還未證實，德意密簽同盟條約雖未公佈，但從他們軍事上物質上軍事技術人才上的互相帮助，從他們在每一侵略行動的互相呼應，特別是希特勒的最近對國會演說，「重新聲明德國將于戰時爲意大利之臂助」，及讚賞「日本在過去二年來，已表現不少之英勇榜樣，彼實在世界之另一方面爲文化而戰鬥也」，可以窺見德，意，日已有更密切的軍事上的關係。</p>
<p>因此，侵峪者進行公開的軍事擴充，德國用四十餘萬工人進行飛機生產，要求潜艇與英國相等，强迫十七歲以上男子懸掛國防徽章加入兵役，意大利從事海陸空軍的擴充，動員了後備兵五十萬，日本也在加强進行其總動員法案。</p>
<p>正當德，意，日更瘋狂進攻的時候，英法的金融資本集團又實行了不少爲虎作倀的政策，繼續執行其「現實主義」「不干涉」西班牙撤退志願兵「調解」西班牙的戰局，盡量設法親近德、意，英德談判，英意談判，法意談判，法德宣言一幕幕的演出，企圖拆散法蘇的親密關係，加厚四强的友誼，組成反對蘇聯的陣綫，同時不得不加强對自家人民的進攻，最明顯的表現是法國的代法律命令的頒佈。</p>
<p>英法雖然以現實主義爭得國際局勢的暫時和緩，但也不得不加緊擴充軍備，爲的是要維持與鞏固其統治實不得不如此，英法軍備的擴張，固然在客觀上可能起一些反侵略力量的作用，但是，在今天他們却企圖警吿德意的刀鋒不要朝着自己來，壓迫德意當眞做「防共」的十字軍，衝到烏克蘭去。</p>
<p>三、和平陣線的發展</p>
<p>在德，意，日與「現實主義」調協的狀態下，和平陣線也在不斷的發展，艱苦的奮鬥，積聚自家力量，準備與侵略陣線作决死的鬥爭，　（未完）</p>

<h3>白崇禧講　抗戰來的進步</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>在滇擴充紀念週上</p>
<p>【昆明特約航訊】本人首先對各位報吿的，是到雲南的觀感。雲南是抗戰後方的重鎭，國際又通的要道；南有滇越路與安南毗連，經安南可以到印度。西有滇緬路，從緬甸可達歐洲，東有叙昆路，沿江而出太平洋，若由漢口繼續北上，也可以到歐洲去。雲南不惟處於國際交通的孔道，而且民性淳樸，氣候溫和，蘊藏豐富，這是復興民族的根據地，因爲復與民族的根據地是在西南，而雲南又是西南的重鎭。故復興中國民族，必由雲南起　·若說到歷史方面，民國肇興，袁世凱稱帝，雲南首義，推倒帝制，恢復民主的中華民國。這使是雲南在歷史上最光榮的一頁。尤其自抗戰展開後，雲南曾以最大的人力物力，貢献國冢，在前線參加作戰的，無不以一當十，英勇壯烈，這楚龍主席勵　圖治的結果。我們還希望雲南在龍主席領導之下，能成爲土耳其的安哥拉，作我們中華民國復興的根據地。現在我們的抗戰巳轉入第二階段，就此把第二期抗戰中的幾個重要問題，提出來講調；</p>
<p>確立黨的抗戰　建國綱領</p>
<p>我們要作革命工作，必定要　團體，有組織。有堅强的組織，方能領導革命勢力去奮鬥，努力，革命才會成功。國民黨是救國救民的黨，三民主義是救國救民的主義。它在過去推倒滿消，打倒北洋軍閥，現在又領導全國民衆負起了民族革命的使命而未來復興民族的重担，是放在我們國民黨的身上，因爲它是一個革命的政黨，才能負起這重大的使命來。在　戰發生後，本黨召開臨全大會，决定了抗戰建國的網領，成爲我們抗戰的準則．同時，它更產生了一三民主義靑年團」及「國民　政會」，一是代表靑年意志的團體，一是代表全國民意的機關。不論何黨何派，只要能拋棄以　的主義，吩離了過去的黨派，服從領袖，參加神聖的抗戰，都可以加入，繼續我們此次的五全大會，也有重要的抗戰决議，特別在黨務工作方面，多注意下層工作，下層機構。因爲黨的基礎，是建築在下層工作上，過去多着重於上層一忽略了下層，使抗戰的機構，運用不為，還是最大的錯誤。現在旣發現這種缺點，所以要把它改正過來，其改正的辦法。我們要引用　潔的靑年，深入民間，去領導民衆，組織民衆，共謀中國的復興。最近有少數的人，還在詆毀國民黨，認爲它不能領導中國的民衆。這種謬誤的思想，我敢斷言，乃未深研總理遣敎所致，亦或是有意破壞。並且有一種患恐赤病者，竟恐怕抗戰終了，國民黨將爲共黨所代替，這種心理，也是過分的顧慮。難道現在領導抗戰的，不是國民黨嗎？它旣領導全國人民抗戰，當然而個全國是性的抗戰的組織了，况且今日共產黨巳誠懇的服　中央，放棄了以前的　級鬥爭，而一致團結的做着民族鬥爭的工作。事實勝於雄辯，勿庸我多爲申叙，中國現在所需要的是民族鬥爭，而不是階級鬥爭，就事實說，中國根本沒有大地主大資本家，所以我們不要害怕它，也不要歧視它，要慢慢的融化它。只有親日派才願入防共的宣傳，要這樣，他們才可引用廣用的三原則，來做　滅中國的藉口，我們不要再受他們的騙。</p>
<p>加強政治下層機構</p>
<p>在政冶方面，自七七事發後，我們巳達到了五千年歷史上所沒　的統一，眞實地做到地無分南北，人無分男女老幼，大家都站在一條線上，以前帝王時代的統一，是一種强迫的，覇道的統一，現在却是同心同德的認淸了非團結奮鬥不能救國。但在十九個月來　政治動員，雖達　了我們的愿望，仍未做到民治法治的精神，還楚重上而不重下。尤其壞的是接近民衆的下　行政機關問題，如各鄉鎭保長，都沒有確實負起動員民衆的使命。談到動員民衆，是有四個階段，一是喚起民衆，二是組織民衆，三是訓練民衆，四是應用民衆。我們現在是　應用民衆了。我們要應用民衆，首先要動　起有熱血的靑年來。因爲靑年是果敢有爲的，靑年是前進的，靑年是純潔的，靑年是國家的楝樑，靑年是建造國家的柱石。（萬人鼓掌）所以我們要發動靑年來負担此抗戰建國中的下層重任。第二點値得報吿的是平漢各游擊區，已設立黨政委員會，　立起淪陷區的政權，以阻止×人以華制華的毒計，過去×人是用我們的錢，來訓練我們的人，來侵略我們的土地。所以我們現在成立了黨政委員會，消滅地的僞組織，使他不能誘惑　們的民衆。例如　寗。和察哈爾，以及各游擊區，我們都派了省主席，不但使民衆不外向，並且還配合戰略，取得政治動員的效果。　（未完）</p>

<h3>小評　聖地的戰雲</h3>
<p>戰靈籠　聖城耶路撤冷以至整個巴力斯祖、雖然不是一件新聞，尤其是自從德國侵略魔王希特勒登台，勾結歐洲的意大利侵略者和東方的日本侵略者，積極發動世界大戰以來，這光榮偉大的聖地，便已成爲法西斯侵略者騷擾的目標。不過戰爭時起時伏，其事態從未有如今日之嚴重的。但看張伯倫之親自出席巴力斯坦會議，就可知其形勢的緊張。</p>
<p>聖地戰靈的　出，雖爲猶太人阿拉伯人的民族鬥爭，而實際上則各有其背景，這是公開的秘密。特別是自慕尼黑協定成立以至最近意大利在西班牙獲勝，英法統治者的妥協政策表現得更加明顯而澈底，使德意侵略者更加猖狂。巴力斯祖是地中海和黑海紅海中間的古代文明發源地，又是今日歐亞兩洲交通要衝，在經濟上軍事上政治上都有極重要的地位，因此聖地成爲德意侵略者新的侵略目標。他們近來積極策動阿拉伯人的『獨立建國運動』，企圖威脅英國割讓殖民地，作爲德意法西斯進攻亞洲大陸的第一步。英國統治者對此雖無積極表示，但亦極力扶助猶太人以反對阿拉伯人的要求。因此聖地戰雲瀰　，而耶路撤冷便難得平靜的一日了。</p>
<p>我們認定，聖地戰雲是德國侵略者對英威脅的進一步表現，是法西斯，略者蹂躪文化威脅亞洲　進一步表現。我們更認定掃蕩聖地暗雲的有效辦法，第一是要求英國政府採取正確政策，二面以實力反擊法西斯侵略者勢力的東漸，一面實現民埃平等生存政策，俾巴力斯坦猶阿兩大古文明民族，得以自由生存，平等相處，互助發展。第二是要求　阿兩族各自提高其古代文明民族的自尊性，放棄利用侵略者以求自由的投機路綫，實現反法西斯侵略的民族統一戰綫，互相平等協助，以求民族解放。第三是要求近東各國迅速成立互相協定，建立集最安全制度，合力抵抗正在向東推進的法西斯侵略勢力。</p>
<p>最後我們由于聖地的戰靈，更加認靑法西斯侵略者的確是人類文明的蹂躪者—而且一切對於法西斯侵略者的妥協政策，只會加重人類文明與世和平的威脅！德意侵略者勢力已經直接侵入亞洲，我們要發動一切力量去阻止他們！</p>

<p>二九三六　百分之四十六　百分之五十四</p>
<p>二九三七　百分之六十七　百分之三十三</p>
<p>二九三八　百分之六十八　百分之三十二</p>
<p>以今日日本之工業比較瀋陽事變以前，民需與軍需恰好相互換變地位，而日×政策之違反民生，觀之更覺明顯。</p>
<p>隨着重工業的畸形發展，就發生對外貿易的失調，成入超現象，因日本國內重工業和輕工業的原料均很缺乏，以日本購買力之低落，尤其在這戰爭時期，如果軍需原料騾然增加，則民需原料勢必大受打擊，最近一年中日本國內羊毛的輸入額減少百份之八十二，生棉及小麥减去百分之六十七，蔴，樹膠及木料均减少百分之五十二，但是其主要重工業原料之輸入僅减去百分之一而已，因此，我人更加可以明白，日本的準備金是愈弄愈少。然其軍需原料之輸入，常須賴國內輕工業之輸出，作爲彌補。日本輕工業生產品之輸出，以紡織品爲最要，最近一年內平均每月生棉進口由一百三十多萬减至九十萬祖，而棉紗之生產量每月平均亦降低百份之二十五，由於這種失調現象，使日本對外購買力日漸薄弱，國內物價更加飛漲。</p>
<p>同時全世界民主國家如火如荼的抵貨運動，也使日本當局如芒刺在背，惴惴不安，據最近從日本得來的統計，一九三七年十二月起日本對外輸出貨品的價　，有减無增，一九三七年日貨輸出額總數是卅一萬七千五百萬日元，較之一九三六年的廿六萬九千三百萬元，是增加了四萬八千二百萬元，卽百分之十八，但是到一九三七年底日貨輸出額開始較去年同月减少，一九三八年中每個月均較一九三七年同月减少，現將其主要幾　國家輸人日貨滅少的百分比數如下：</p>
<p>海峽殖民地……百分之七十五</p>
<p>蘇聯……百分之七十二</p>
<p>英屬馬來亞……百分之六十六</p>
<p>荷屬東印度……百分之四十八</p>
<p>美國……百分之四十八</p>
<p>菲律濱……百分之三十四</p>
<p>加拿大……百分之二十八</p>
<p>印度……百分之二十七</p>
<p>南非……百分之二十四</p>
<p>英國……百分之九</p>
<p>在上述各國中，除蘇聯以外，在中日戰事卡爆發以前多是輸入日貨的國家，這些國家中購買日貨最多的就是我們美國，計一九三七年上半年，爲三萬三千六百五十萬日元，一九三八年上半年，雖減少幾及一半，但仍有一萬七千四百九十萬日元，而蘇聯輸人日貨在一九三八年內不及三百萬日元，日貨輸出的減少，使日×侵華的戰費上受到一種重大的打擊。日本向外借欵，大多均吿貸　門，除自顧不暇的德意兩國少有成功外，餘多無大希望，然其貿易入超止在挺進。而所存現金已耗去三分之一以上，現欵旣有　，借欵又不易，而入超還是方興未艾，處於這種形勢之下，日本决無力再繼續侵略下去，而反使其國體陷入困累的大泥沼中，加之　在各國對日均抱惡感，要是他不得外援，那末就是一個月的大規模戰爭，它也是不易支持的，日本人民所需要的是「和平」，各安生業。要是再支持對華侵略戰爭，那國內的革命將迅速的發生，倘使軍方專　還繼續下去，經演的負担，一日重似一日，國際的怨恨也與日俱增，則日本將受縛於仇恨重疊之網中。</p>

<h3>又一批青年回國服務</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>學賑會第四批回國服務團授旗禮</p>
<p>「過年」的氣氛籠罩下的香港，盤旋在一般人腦際的，是如何找錢來過年關？與如何在吃，穿，玩，……上面來盡情享樂。但是，在另外的一面，却有一批熱血沸騰的靑年，情願離開這個「安樂窩」將要奔到祖國的火綫去服務。盤旋在他們腦際的，是如何去和士兵與民衆做熱親的朋友。</p>
<p>不久以前才送過靑年會隨軍服務團回國服務，香港學賑會第四批囘國服務團又於昨晚舉行授旗禮，定於明天首途。學賑會與靑年會形式上雖然是二個團體，是可工作的同一目標、與活潑的精神表現，却同樣地是可敬與可愛。</p>
<p>昨晚，記者本着興奮的心情，準於七時到學賑會禮堂參加第四批回國授旗典禮。</p>
<p>領袖的大幅肖像位在禮堂的正中　壁報，文吿貼滿了四周。充分表現香港最高學生團體的信仰與工作的動態。</p>
<p>和記者談話的一位女同學剛好就是不願意在査港的學校念下去，亦未嘗告訴過家庭而滿心高興地要回到祖國去服務，記者在深受感動之下，聯想到最近上海一大批靑年給學校與家庭找不着而偷偷地跑到前線去發展靑年人的熱情與活力，是頗有類似的地方。這是一個事實問題：在這個大時代之下，靑年人是關不住的，積極的　導才是辦法。</p>
<p>據該團團長譚介夫語記者：學賑會發動三批服務團回國共一百來人，分配在各個戰埸服務，現在都很平安，工作進行亦極順利。今次第四批共三十人，大部份是査港的同學，另一部份是廣州來港的學生興知識靑年。中間有一二分之一是女性。爲了參加神聖的民族解放鬥爭，他們與他們犧牲了舒適的生活，而情願過着運吃飯在內，每月只有六塊錢的艱苦生活。他們的物質條件雖然是遠不如靑年曾隨軍服務團，可是英勇苦鬥的精神越是敎人感佩，香港靑年學生的進步，的確亦是表現中華民族的新生。</p>
<p>禮堂擁擠起來了，開會的儀式亦就開始着。行過，主席李致耀政開會詞之後，接着就是授旗，報吿；演說，歌詠，充溢着緊張，熱烈的情緒。</p>
<p>我們對于該團的敬意，正像對靑年會隨軍服務團一樣　回國服務，是優秀的靑年，是中華民族所需要的兒女。靑年人的熱力與活力好好發揮起來，定司以感動將士與民衆。但是，有幾點還得注意的是：（一）要針對現實。輕視客觀環境，亦別將客觀環境估價得過高，（二）深入下層生活，克服說話術語化與生活貴族化。（三）嚴肅私生活，表現團體化，紀律化的精神。（四）士兵與民衆所發生的問題都是我們要替他們解决，替他們服務的範園，克服只能唱唱歌，做做戲的幼稚病。最末，我們謹祝福服服務朋友在生活實踐中加强目我敎育，在苦難中生長起來！</p>

<h3>轉載　舊陰謀的新花樣</h3>
<p>— 陳紹禹</p>
<p>在延安各界民眾抗日××大會的演講</p>
<p>（七）汪精衞××××的行爲不是偶然的</p>
<p>同志們！各界同胞們！</p>
<p>（八）×××中全會指出日×和親日派的陰謀</p>
<p>大家都記得：</p>
<p>仍舊隱藏在抗戰營壘以內，與×××作××××的活動。</p>
<p>（九）目前形勢的特點</p>
<p>目前政治形勢的特點，恰就在於日×在中國堅持抗戰和他自己困難增加的面前在準備新的對我軍事進攻之外，加緊運用×××等作實行『以華制華』政策的工具。</p>
<p>（十）附帶質問張君勵</p>
<p>講到這裏，我也要附帶地質問一下幾位國社黨的黨員，首先我要問張君勵爲什麽，因爲他的行動與汪精衛關係太密切了。在第一屆參政會大會上，張君勵對任何問題未發一言而恰恰只發言提議通過感謝「德高望重」的汪議長的决議；在第二屆參政大會上，又提了一個實際上反對蔣委員長的提案，同時不顧我們的反對，而在汪精衞贊助之下在大會上作反對蔣委員長的報吿，在汪精衞逃走的不久以前，又發了一封所謂致毛澤東先生的公開信，信的內容不外是反共，反八路軍，反陝甘寧邊區，與汪精衛以後（去年十二月二十九日通電中）所講的反共內容沒有兩樣，同時在張君勵這封信發表以後，日本人馬上在無綫雷廣播說，汪精衛派的張君勵發表了一封致毛澤東公開信，實行反共，對張先生大加贊揚。所有這一切，是我們不能不懷疑張君勵的政治立塲。有人說張君勵恐係與汪精衛一鼻孔出氣；有人說，張君勵是個大學敎授，沒有政治經驗，受了汪精衛利用。到底張君勵爲什麽許多行動與汪精衛一致？我們希望張君勵自己在言論和行動上來向國人作答覆。此外，在第二屆國民參政會上，有個別參政員發表主和言論不代表決擁護蔣委員長及其十月三十日宣言的，恰巧也又是國社黨黨員。因此現在許多人對於國社黨的政治立塲發生了疑問，我們希望國社黨對於根本國策問題要有緊定的立塲，我們希望國社黨及其他領導者和黨員起來糾正張君勵違反抗戰國策的言論和行動。講到這裏，我願再一次忠告那些今天主觀上不是汪派人物，但特別製造國共磨擦破壞國共關係的反共份子們：請你們少鬧意氣，請你們少存成見，請你們認淸共產黨八路軍是堅决抗日的力量，是抗日人們的忠心朋友。你們現在反共，客觀上就是幫助日×和汪精衞；你們現在反共，實際上就是反對抗戰，就是反料領導抗戰的國民黨，就是反對中華民族解放。同時我們願意吿訴所有中國同胞在我們抗戰大時代一個最正確最簡單明瞭的認識眞理的方法，就是凡是日×漢奸認爲好的，對於中國人一定是壞的；相反的，凡是日×漢奸認爲壞的，對於中國人一定是好的。根據道一不可磨滅的眞理，所以日×寵愛注精衞，我們中國人一定要反對汪精衛；日×漢奸反對蔣委員長，反對國民黨，反對國民政的，我們中國人一定要擁護蔣委昌長，擁護國民黨，擁護國民政府；日本漢奸反對共產黨，反對八路軍，反對新四軍，反對陜甘寗邊區，我們中國人民一定擁護×××，擁護八路軍，擁護新四軍，擁護陜甘寧邊區，日×漢奸要破壞國共合作，破壞全民族團結以　　破壞中國抗戰使中國滅亡，我們中國人民一定要擁護國共合作，緊全民挨團結，堅持抗戰爭取中國獨立生存。凡是日×漢奸愛說的話，不說！凡是日×漢奸高興的事，不做！這應當是每個眞正中國人今天起碼的責任和應有的態度。汪精衛受日×威脅引誘而逃出我國抗戰的後方，汪精衞把敵相近衛聲明當作自己通電的藍本　汪精衞甘願執行日×『以華制華』政策而進行反蔣，反共，反抗戰的卑鄙行動，所以！——日本法西斯軍閥！打倒日×的新工具——</p>
<p>擁護抗戰領袖蔣委員長！擁護領導抗戰的國民黨！</p>
<p>擁護領導抗戰的國民政府！</p>
<p>擁護國共長期合作！擁護堅持抗戰的共產黨！</p>
<p>加緊全民族團結，堅持抗戰！反對妥協投降！</p>
<p>中華民族解放萬歲！</p>

<p>交通旅行</p>
<h3>從汕頭到西貢</h3>
<p>— 華游</p>
<p>上了西貢岸</p>
<p>二十三日上午七時準備着上岸，因爲人數太多了，我們不願意同人家　在一起，等到八點二十分才離開了船　脚　到法國的殖民地。（在船梯邊　着許多的醫生，檢騐你手臂上的痘是否有發，未發的話，須給仙們再種。）我手裏的小皮箱，也給站在船梯脚的碼頭工人接了去，讀者注意，站在西貢碼頭的工人替你援了行李，並不是給你往旅館送，而是給搬到海關的棧房裏存査，我們只能空着手給安南警察條趕猪趕鴨般趕到海關裏搜査。搜査完畢了冉給趕人新客衙（俗稱『猪仔牢』）去印指頭模，辦理入口的手續。當地統治者利用我們各地的方言，巧立了五帮（　肇，潮州，寫應，海南，福建，）的名目，再由五帮之中分出七府來：潮州，嘉應，　崖，高州，雷州，福建（這裏似單揩廈門而言。）這樣自然很便利於受他們的統治。一般華僑因爲彼此方言的隔膜，常常鬧意氣，如　毆爭訟二類的事情是多得沒法子去統計他。最近我國政府在西貢那裏設了領事館，一般華僑因爲不懂，國語不能與領事館各辦事人員直接交換意見，他們已漸漸感覺到學習國語的需要，一方面領事館也正從事努力宣傳國語普及化，相信在不久的將來，那邊華僑會化除他們的畛域聯合起來的。</p>
<p>各帮的辦事房，門頂都掛着一塊尺來長五寸寬的木板刻着幾個紅字，各帮鄱雇用一種職員辦理該帮民的入口紙，一般人稱呼這班職員，都目之爲『媽臻』（Machin）『媽臻』的月薪由六元至二十元不等，他們的月薪雖然這樣少，但他們的衣冠是非常闊綽的，西裝革履出入乘車，固不待言矣，喝則馬蘭池酒，吸則『公班』鴉片烟（安南吸鴉片烟的人特別多），你細心替他計算一日的用費非十塊錢不來。他們那來這許多錢花呢，說到這裏，就得叙述他們的經濟來源了。據西貢永安旅店的老關吿訴我：『這些「媽臻」賺的黑錢多着呢！如果靠仗了他們的月薪還不够他們吸香烟呵！不是賺黑錢，那來許多的好酒公烟呢！』當我問他賺的是什麼黑錢之後，他只舉了一個例，就已够令人昨舌不已了。他說，每次由汕頭到西貢的華僑，人數總在一千以上！在這一千多人之中，就有許多年齡在二十多歲以上兩個子小的人，往往想騙减幾歲報爲小童字（法政府規定十八歲以上的人須納人頭稅。）這樣所謂「媽臻」者會鼓着如簧的三寸舌對你脫，他會帮你的忙，把你的年歲寫減幾歲，（其實這也是他們的職務應該着那樣做）同時向你索取代價，每名幾十元不等。他們不外憑了一個嘴和一枝會寫數目字的鋼筆，他們雖替人家塡上那數目字，並不是會把那一張入口紙拿給新客官（法國人）簽名，蓋仍須由着本人拿給新客官簽名，如果新客官認爲你不只那數目字的年臨時，他可再替你加上幾歲。據此說來，所謂「媽臻」者，　無資格賺這一筆疑也。可憐的是這些僑民多半未受過敎育，一朝到陌生的地方，語言旣不通，規矩又不懂、只好硬着頭　任人敲詐罷了！</p>
<p>除了上面所說的事，此外他們生財之道的法子仍多着呢！例如他可以你的出入口稅上，另外加上一筆他們私自規定的稅則，只就出口紙來說，假如你請他辦理出口紙時，他會巷你多加幾塊錢，做他們的手續費，據說在新客衙裏祖任料理出入口紙，他現在賺存二十多萬塊錢，無疑的這位富翁的財產，是由我們龍十萬僑胞的血所築成的。法國人對此種非法的收入是絕對不允許的，只要你拿出証據前往吿發，殖民地的政府是不能寬恕他們的。可惜一般的華僑，百分之九十是未受過敎育，自然不曉得收集什麼據，同時也沒有那種勇氣前往吿發。他們因爲深知一般僑胞的弱點，所以也就無所忌憚，爲所欲爲了。</p>
<p>在新客衙辦理入口手續，能够賄賂自然早淸手續出來，如果一過他們的辦事時間，那未就得暫時屈你的尊駕給他們關鎖起來，假如你是禮拜六岸的話，那末他們辦事的時光，只有一個上午，在一個上午的時間自然不能把這一千多人的入口紙弄得淸楚的，所有給他關鎖在「猪仔牢」的人，只好眼巴巴地等待星期一的來臨。這樣就得做兩夜日的有期徒刑，這是指一般有錢可以納稅的來講。假如你沒有錢可以完納稅務的話，就得把你關到另外一種監獄裏，待到有船出口時，你就得給他們驅逐出境，許多人因爲錢不够，往往吃到這種苦頭的。作者曾一度藉着探詢罪人的名義到移民局裏參觀那專爲拘留我們的僑胞而設立的監獄時，看見許多僑胞鳩形鵠立在監獄的鐵門裏，當時就發生下面二個感想：你們從老遠的祖國給鐵船運到那裏來，那一筆路費，說不定是賣了耕牛典着屋籌來的；你們總滿想一到這裏就可以發看洋財婦去做富翁，那料到一上了西貢岸就沒錢納稅，現在又落得坐了監牢，縱幸能够給他們驅逐出境，再囘到家鄕去，但是你們的耕牛，甚至一椽老屋己　在他人的手，裏這又何苦來，了</p>

<h3>歡迎菲律賓球友　（一）</h3>
<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>菲律賓派來的埠際足球選手、　着體育大使的使命、將于明晨踏上我們的香島來了、他們這番的蒞臨、除了角逐埠際錦標外、還以前驅者的身份、肩着溝通兩地體育界的聲氣、和敦睦雙方的　　誼的重要任務、因此、在他們登岸的當　、我敢以萬二分的至誠、代表本島的足球界和一切有關的份子、用最　烈的心情、來表示我們這一次歡迎嘉賓的　意、</p>
<p>在已往、菲律賓的足球隊、雖然和番島結過了一面之錄、但脚踏實地的來作埠際比賽、無疑地這還是破　兒第一遭、香港足球史那本永不　　的　、從此又添上了黃金般的一頁、他們這回的光降、是祖任着鑄成那條不會中斷的「友誼練一的第一個鐵環、把兩地足球界的友誼、牢牢地水久連鎖着、這偉大的工作和貢獻、是値得我們敬佩到五體投地、値得我們鼓掌稱善的、</p>
<p>非律賓和杳港、雖則相距祇有六百餘里的海程、但那邊足球的消息和動態、却一向有點特殊的隔膜、一九一三年在非舉行的第一屆遠東大會中、非律賓足球隊把我們那時烏合之帥擊敗了、恐怕便是我們最先一次知道非律賓足球的厲害　、到後來每一次的遠迷、中菲兩國的足球隊、都有龍爭虎鬥毆的劇戰、幸虧每次的結果、都由我們佔得最後的勝利、筆者和菲律賓的足球隊、間接直接上發生過不少的接觸、有那狠深遠的情緣、趁他們這回征港的良機、我想把他們的「足球史　、盡我記憶力所及的和盤托出、敬吿那一向對菲方足球無多大認識的迷胞、</p>
<p>菲律賓在未歸美合衆國保護前、本由西班牙統治、那邊足球的隨習、其發軔就是被西班牙東渡風氣所　陶、西班牙的足球、在歐大陸是有點地位的、所以菲律賓方面、近年來在美合衆國的　携誘掖下、雖然沒有全力推進到足球一項、但因爲原始有了良好的導師、早已奠下了美麗　　的足球基礎、一向還可以保持着相當的藝術水準、還記得筆者最初一次和菲律賓足球隊接觸、是在一九二三年第六屆遠東大會中、我們以三比零戰勝、那回球戰的劇烈、至今囘想起來、尤有點談虎色　、菲人那　踢來粗野不堪、釀成不少風波、把初登大雅的我、嚇到不寒而慄、他們的單個技術頗具功夫、但聯絡方面、還未十分講求注重、到一九二　平、在菲舉行第七屈遠運、他們仗着地利人和立下了雪恥的大决心、可是仍以五比一的球數、給我們擊　片甲不留、一九二六年、他們組隊遠征荷東　、　謀進步、結果成績平平、返國後、反因旅費津貼問題、被全菲體育協進會指爲受薪、　奪業餘資格兩週年、一九二七年第八屆遠運、迫得改由後起的學界中人補充、實力大受影響、對吾國之戰、復以三比零見負、一九二八年筆者自滬率樂華征菲、六戰中四勝一和一敗、那時菲人對足球的興趣、還未及擁護棒球籃球來得熱烈、一力三〇年第九屆遠　、仍爲我國以三比一所克服、一九三二年筆者冉率南華隊遊菲、六戰全勝、且在菲初作晚間試賽引起社會人士不少旨趣、及一九三四年、第十屆遠運又輪値在菲舉行、政府與社會方面贊助不遺餘力、募集　資、鳩工究材、興建　偉運動場、菲人對體育事業、由是益盛興奮、對足球一道、更　極提倡、是年中菲之賽、吾隊又以二比零獲勝、這便是筆者本人最後和菲人週旋的一次、這十一年來、（一九二三至一九三四）所得的觀感、菲方足球最顯著之演變、厥爲合作方面之進步、往者徒靠個人技術、及後既逐漸明瞭全隊聯絡之握要、竭力追隨近代科學化踢法存、　（未完）</p>

<h3>紀念亡友張曙</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>自從神聖的抗戰展開後，無數萬不願做，隸的中華民族的兒女們，都在殘毒的××的侵略的　力，槍彈，砲彈，炸彈下面，喪失了他們和她們的尊貴的生命！</p>
<p>在這無數萬的可敬的犧牲者當中，我所認識的也就已經不少了。光以最近來說吧，就已經有三四位；屬于文藝圈中的蒲風（按蒲風最近已有信致香港友人，仍在前方工作，並未遇難）和張曙，就是其中的兩位。</p>
<p>關于蒲　及其英勇殉國，最近我已經在重慶大公報發表過一篇哀悼的短文，此處不擬再提了，</p>
<p>張曙，如大家所知道的一般，乃是一位優秀的作曲家和聲樂家，他從事于歌曲的硏究和製作，已經有相當長久的時間了。他對于民間歌謠，尤有研究，因而他所製作的曲子，也很富有民歌情調，易爲一般大衆所接受。</p>
<p>近年以來，會有一個相當長的時期，他住在湖南原藉養病。「七七」事變的不久之前，他纔重來上海，記得在星海家中第一次碰到他的那天晚上，他就把在家鄉養病期所　作的「車夫曲」（那歌詞是我作的）給我看，並且，還用他那洪亮的喉囉唱給我聽。以後，在他的寓中，和在星海家幾次的「歌曲作者協會」的會議席上，大衆還碰過幾次頭。「七七」之後，「八一三」之前，我們還合作了一首「保衞華北一的歌（此歌，後來又改名爲「保衞國土」，但内容并沒有多大更動）。</p>
<p>『八一三』之後，他終于又囘到灘南，在長沙工作。他之由長沙到桂林，好像還沒有好久的時間，然而，不幸他就桂林被犧牲了！</p>
<p>張曙之死，對于中國的音樂界，當然是一大損失，正如聶耳之死對子中國樂壇是一大損失一般地。對于個人呢，因爲會有過相當的交情而且又是個戰友的關係，自然，更不能不感到無限的痛惜！</p>
<p>然而，死者已矣，夫復何言？現在，我們唯一的希望，就是：踏着他的血跡，將有着更多的人起來做他所沒有做完的工作，完成他未竟的遺志！</p>
<h3>一新自己的觀點</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>抗戰以來，一般人最易犯的毛病就是：對於新發生的事情，往往缺乏新的觀點，總是一本因襲的老法子來看，所以結果，不但看不出事實的本身，反而發生了無謂的悲觀。</p>
<p>最好的例子，便是戰爭觀點。</p>
<p>先前内戰的勝負，是取决於險要地帶，重要城市，以及交通要道的得失的。至於戰區内百老百姓，因兩方的敵對者，都是本國人，無論誰勝誰負，都可不管，一味準備做順民就是。故一城一市的得失，卽認爲戰爭勝負的關鍵，這種看法，便純粹是内戰的觀點了。不幸大多數人，每次對於軍事方面的新部署，軍隊主力的移動却正是拿這種舊觀點來判斷的。</p>
<p>至於抗戰的勝負，除了地方得失之外更主要的，是取决於人心之歸向與否。若人民富自尊心，不甘做亡國奴，則莫不自動武裝起來，防守祖國保衝家鄉的。故國防主力軍隊，雖因戰略關係，暫　變更部署，而游擊戰爭，仍然會風起雲湧，到處予×人以打擊，使×人所得之重要城市，僅爲一點，所得的鐵路河流，僅爲一綫而已。由這看來，一城一市的得失，在抗戰期間來講，絕不能就此分個勝負的。我們年來抗戰的實際情形，便恰是如此。今後我們要以對外抗戰的觀點，來判斷抗日的各次戰役，庶不致再陷於錯誤，而弄到無謂的悲觀了。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，改變因襲的看法，一新自己觀點乃是非常必要的！</p>
<h3>集體創作與個性</h3>
<p>— 竹友</p>
<p>無疑，時什精神之正確的說明，是文學的一個眞正使命。爲此，則以『忠實正確反映抗戰現象「爲」最基本的任務』底抗戰文學是這一個　時代中所特有的前進的產物。這一種產物所採用的方式，也無疑地應該是（非絕對的）集體創作，看潔孺先生「抗戰文學與集體創作」那篇文章，我很相信『集體創作是人類幾千年來藝術實踐的發展底一新路』那話，人類文化是向新的方面發展無疑地在事實上愈新每每愈進步，有什麽理由不贊成果體創作？</p>
<p>可是在集體創作施於實用時，作家的個性與集禮創作之會不會抵觸是成問題了。據潔孺先生的意見，以爲「作家在參加了集體創作之後，是否會限制了他個人特殊的才能和他的天才之發展」這問題的答案是「否定的」。這否定，在下是不敢苟同。在下過去與潔孺先生在民族日報副刊討論得多，在這裏亦僅以尋求正確理論的心情，把集體創作與個性這個問題提出討論。是討論，並不是筆戰，我更不敢担上挑戰的罪名。</p>
<p>據潔孺先生文內說，「所謂集體創作，乃是在一個主要的特定題目網領之下，或者在一種持定的主題和題材之下，組織起一部分的作家來共同從事創作，集題地處理主題的表現，集體地從事素材的投集，以至於藝術的槪括，結構，佈局，題才的發展，人物的性格，姿態，言動和描寫手法，用語修辭等，都由集體來討論與决定，然後通過集體的表現和修改的過程而完成底創作的活動。」按這話，顯然地見得潔孺先生底意見，以爲集題創作的結構。布局，題材的發展，人物的性格，姿態，言動和描寫手法，用語修　等等，都由集體來「决定」。無疑，這一個「决定」是「固定」了，固定了的結　，固定了布局，固定了的題材的發展，固定了的……一切一切，豈不做成了機械的一本創作集，限制了作者的個性，或而固有了一决定」的阻撓而致不能流利地運用他自己的特殊手法？</p>
<p>在决定了的結構，布局之下去發展個性，縱使不是絕對難於發展天材，至少也於發展有相當障碍。</p>
<p>再按潔孺先生文：「集禮主義只不過是把各個個性統一在一個正確的認識範疇之內，對個性加以誘導　影響，使之在實踐底過程中改造自己而已。」就這話中所謂誘導，所謂影響，雖然可斷然說句一集體主義和個性　不是對立」，可是在該作家的個性方面，天才之發展方面，多少不免有了影響了。換句話，多少不免有了相當（縱使是很微）的限制，「改造」了。</p>
<p>爲此，以我的愚昧，以爲集體創作對作家特殊手法，特殊才能等，是有了相當的限制於其發展了。是以我　以求敎的心情，在拋棄了舐筆伸紙的生活兩月餘的逃難　，把這問題提出討論，希　作家讀者們，共同研究出一個正確的解答。</p>
<p>二八，二，二夜深於靑山</p>
<h3>給母親</h3>
<p>— 悅明</p>
<p>在寂寞的夜裏，母親，我時時令起你來。</p>
<p>當那天，父親和姊姊替我提着皮箱，送我上船去的時候，你拖著病弱的身體，依在門檻上望著我流淚，你鳴咽著說：「明兒—今後你到何時再回來呢？……到何時再回來。看你的老爺娘呢？……」這時你嘶嘶的哭聲顯得更響了。我眞不忍望你，也不知道怎樣安慰你好，祇背了身子喉龍間拚出了：「媽媽我去了」，</p>
<p>回憶這次囘來時，我很高興地踏上樓梯，在五歲時別了的海眞，在門邊唱著歌，他一見了我，很天眞地說：「哥哥回來了。」我眞料想不到他那幼年的心靈上，還沒有忘記他哥哥的面容。那天，你正受了由鄉至滬的暈船而病在床上，父親在床邊替你　著藥。當你轉身過來看見了站在你四年沒有見過一面的愛兒時，你好像不相信自己的眼睛似的坐起來說：「你是我的明兒嗎？啊，你還沒有忘記你的老娘嗎？」你完全地忘却了自己的病，高興得幾乎暈倒。你老是紅紅的病眼，不斷地流着熱淚，我像在十歲時的我。</p>
<h3>鄉音</h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>——一封可以公開的信——</p>
<p>××兄：</p>
<p>我現在是在十二分激動的情緒中，我的手不住地抖顫，你可以從歪斜的字體上，看出我們是怎樣興奮的。</p>
<p>我又逃了一次難！幾乎受到了×人的殘殺，我上次信上，不是吿訴你×人每次來這兒放哨嗎？而且鄉人和游擊隊，怎樣使×人的哨兵失踪，我彷彿也吿訴過你了，這兒我要吿訴你的，就是最近發生我現在要吿訴你的事實。</p>
<p>往常×人的步哨，總是不滿三十名的，昨天上午突然從縣裏開來了二三百人，當時我就料到凶多吉少，大部的鄕人，立刻從小徑抄到湖邊的村上去了，可是也有幾個胆大的留在鎭上（漢奸當然也留在鎭上）不，有許多是來不及逃走的，便關了門躲在屋角裏，我便是一個。</p>
<p>不久便有漢奸來逐家敲門，通知每家開門，預備『皇軍』來檢査「良民證」，可是開門的，十家裏沒有半家，誰都知這××進來會做些什麽的。</p>
<p>過了不多時，聽見門板碎裂的聲音了，聽見開槍的聲音了，再等了一會，我又聽到女人的哀號，和男子慘厲的喊救命聲音，我想冉不能獃在家裏。××是立意來洩一下受了游擊隊的氣憤的，我溜到後門，聽一會沒有人走過，我使溜了出來，起初我爬到屋後那片荒地的旱蘆壟裏去，我便坐在那兒，我不知坐了多少時候，雖則我竭力提高警覺性，傾聽着諦視着一切近來的聲音和身影，可是腦子裏亂得還像失眠的人似的。</p>
<p>突然嚇了我一跳，滿眼的紅光，黑烟，東鎮梢火燒起來了，我想我再不能獃在蘆　裏，火星飛到祐了的蘆葉上，立刻會引起火災，把我葬身火窟的，這次我冉也沒有向周遭看一看，站起身來便走，後邊隔不十丈遠，有兩三個××站着，立刻向我開槍，我趕忙伏在荒墳堆後邊，我剛伏下，想起他們會追來，於是我立刻又站起來跑，槍又響了　來，可是我最後把他們拋得遠遠了，我想這次能够逃脫，完全是路上有許多野墳堆，桑樹，旱蘆壟隔斷他們視綫的緣故。路又是很多迂迴曲折的，所以他們想描準極難。</p>
<p>到下午五時×人照例走開以後，鎭上的人才敢回去，徼倖屋子祗燒了七八間，原因是給晒穀場隔斷了沒有延燒全鎮。</p>
<p>這次據沒有逃出而又徼倖躱得很好的隣居說，××進來了，先把男的驅進一個房裏，要是有女人就趕進另一間上房，先動手翻箱倒篋，第一批「騐良民證」的×人，大概最幸運，帶走的都是値錢的金銀細軟，所以脾氣也『好』些，第二批來的，因爲搜刧不到什麼，便揀了些還値錢的，蹂躪女人，把不能帶走的東西盡情毀壞，所以喻到第三批來，就沒有東西可以搶，他們个个簡直變得比吃人的野獸都可怕，他們殺人！放火！輪姦！</p>
<p>興記茶館的夥計死在鈕子上，歪嘴老周死在火柴上，魚販某死在銅元上，你不懂得我的意思罷，我還沒吿訴你近來×人傳染我們的游擊隊的恐怖呢？××怕游擊隊，所以今天說這是游擊隊間諜的符號，明天又說那個是符號—其實你袋裏有錢，讓××們搶了，不作聲走開，就眞是游擊隊都不怕，不過那裏來這麽多錢呢？他們三个，乾脆說句，就死在沒餞給他們搜刮上，而碰巧不過是第一个祗扣了三个鈕子，第二个匣裏剩了三支火柴，第三个死在不多不少的三个銅元之上，據漢好傳出來的消息，三就是三民主義符號，所以是游擊隊，說句笑話，做第三個兒子的我還因而惴惴不安呢。</p>
<p>本來漢奸是土皇帝可是這次殺人放火一來，鎭上恨透了漢奸與××，所以他們，現在也不敢住在鎭上了，總是跟了×兵來去，而且和游擊隊通消息，加入游擊隊的愈來愈多。</p>
<p>「如大早之望雲霓」這句話不會懂得其中焦灼等待的煩惱，鄉人中間每天都停播着克服南京，我們軍隊近來的消息，尤其是鬼子利用漢奸露着恐惶不安的時候，誰都禁不住笑起來，不斷地自己的說：「是時候了」幹他「像傢伙吧！」可是……我們還要等多久呢？</p>
<p>每次游擊隊來了誰都希望，祈求他們長住下來，可是他們老在半夜裏又走了我們這種失望，眞是難以形容的。</p>
<p>不知道這封信還不知能寄到你那兒不能呢？祝你</p>
<p>强壯起來　弟XYZ上緊緊地抱着你，平時落不出的淚，此刻，不知怎樣，像屋檐水般地滾着，沾濕了衣襟，染上了被褥，我望着你滿面的縐紋，逼頭的白髮，使我不相信我們祗別了四年。我的淚，更不能停止。母親！你年紀好像大上了十年。</p>
<p>牆角邊的月，紅花也許沒有謝吧：記得我親自種的幾枝楊柳，也許要生出嫩葉來了；我的鄉居，見了久別的我，他們是多麽歡喜呢！我懷着滿腔的高興，想回到我這個可愛美滿的家園去。可是父親阻止我，知道冢鄉並不這樣地容許我囘去。×人竄進了我們的家，到處逮捕，殘殺，搶擊，姦淫，房屋被燒了，月月紅花，楊柳被截了，鄉居，像失去了巢穴般的小爲，東飛西散了，唉！可愛美麗的家園，如今呵……化爲一個廢墟，母親！你作何感呢？</p>
<p>母親！那次以後，又是好些時候了，在你們過新年中或在悠長的夜裏，你一定會思念着你的兒子的。或許你脆弱的心靈！使你落了好幾次的眼淚吧。望着你的兒子不久再能回來。</p>
<p>可是母親！自己的家，被竄進了一羣狂暴的野狗，一切都被毀滅了。這難道還不够於我們報復的機會嗎？母親！不要期望，拭乾你的眼淚，你應該激昂地說：「孩子，把×人打出去了再囘來吧！」</p>
<p>母親！你的兒子不久就要囘來的，囘到我們可愛的家園與母親相見。</p>

<h3>The Attention All Nations Should Pay to ×'s Invasion of Hainan Island</h3>
<p>The Japanese × occupation of Hainan Island has already caused great international repercussions, with the international press reporting and commenting on it one after another, and the various newspapers in our country also making in-depth analyses. However, in our opinion, the core of this issue lies mainly in the Japanese warlords' shifting of attention from various domestic aspects and their exploration of international trends. Therefore, from our standpoint, regarding this issue, we should concentrate our efforts on analyzing the impact of this move by the Japanese × on Britain, the United States, and France, and on how we should express clear expectations to Britain, the United States, and France. Regarding the former point, this newspaper has made concise analyses for several days. Regarding the latter point, we will express our views further as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island with the intention of occupying it has a completely different impact on Britain, the United States, and France than the war of the previous eighteen months. The previous impact was limited to economic interests, while this time it concerns the military affairs of all countries; previously it was limited to the scope of China, while this time it concerns the Pacific and even the whole world. This point should be acknowledged first. But the more important point is that the Japanese ×'s action this time was clearly directed in secret by the German and Italian accomplices; its purpose is not only to threaten Britain and France, but also to threaten the United States. At a time when the Spanish rebels were temporarily successful, Italy attempted to monopolize it, and Britain and France strongly prevented it, and at a time when the Japanese aggression war has reached the "hanging on" stage and needs greater international changes to continue its development, it is a natural trend for Japanese warlords to accept the demands of Germany and Italy as a condition for concluding a military tripartite alliance. Therefore, the news that the Japanese side sent representatives from the Navy, Army, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Europe to participate in an important meeting in Berlin, with the aim of changing the Anti-Comintern Pact into a formal military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, is absolutely reliable. It is said that Japan originally intended to target the Soviet Union as an attack target, but Germany and Italy insisted that Britain, France, and the United States should be included. This is even more noteworthy news, and the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is not accidental.</p>
<p>We must further remind people at home and abroad that the Japanese naval power is quite weak and not as strong as Naval Minister Yonai Mitsumasa has claimed. Therefore, in future naval battles, they may possibly focus on naval guerrilla warfare to disrupt the huge fleets of Britain, the United States, and France. However, in order to implement naval guerrilla warfare, there must be appropriate land bases. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of the Navy emphasizes the construction of naval bases in the Pacific, but the special budget for naval military expenses this year is a relatively small amount. It is expected that the Japanese Navy's approach will be to further occupy several strongholds along the coast of our country to remedy the weakness of lacking giant battleships. The main intention of occupying Hainan Island lies in this. It can be seen that the Japanese ×'s move is entirely an active effort to prepare for a Pacific war. If Britain, France, and the United States cannot adopt a tough attitude to prevent its sharp edge, then the Japanese Navy may further invade and occupy other coastal strongholds as naval bases in the future, and the power of Britain, the United States, and France in the Pacific will be completely limited to a very small extent. The issue of Hainan Island can almost be said to be the launch of Japan's naval outposts against Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek told foreign reporters directly: This matter is the "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific, and it is the beginning of the Japanese army's southward advance.</p>
<p>Another point that Britain, the United States, and France should pay more attention to is that the Japanese ×'s action this time is just a probe, on the one hand, supporting Germany and Italy, and on the other hand, exploring the attitude of Britain, France, and the United States, and even the determination and strength for a Pacific war. We suggest that Britain, the United States, and France should immediately insist on the treaty basis that Hainan Island cannot be occupied, strongly oppose Japan until the Japanese Navy withdraws from the island. Some news and some major newspapers judged that Britain and France may still not issue protests. Considering the importance of the issue, the British and French governments may not take it so lightly. We believe that Britain and France should have considerable and practical plans, and the United States must actively support Britain and France. It is a big mistake for Britain and France to question Japan whether this occupation is permanent or temporary. We should recognize that the means commonly used by aggressors in the third stage of lung disease is intimidation in order to win victory without war. Germany's victory in Europe is still envied by Japan. Even if the recent intimidation of China has failed, this trick cannot be abandoned internationally. If Britain, France, and the United States can successively be tough, the Japanese aggressors will have no way to survive. The military bases of Britain and France in the Pacific can only be maintained by tough measures; the construction of naval bases by the United States in the Pacific cannot rely solely on military projects, but also requires active diplomacy and economic policies to assist.</p>
<p>The Japanese ×'s occupation of Hainan Island has little to do with China, but a lot to do with Britain, the United States, and France. We hope that all countries will consider it!</p>
<h3>The Passage and Situation Moving Towards War</h3>
<p>— Sun Dehua</p>
<p>1. War is in Progress</p>
<p>International politics after the Munich Agreement has two basic directions: One direction is the continued coordination between the fascist Germany and Italy and the British and French financial capital groups, opposing the interests of their own people, opposing weak nations and small countries, opposing the international labor movement, opposing democratic politics, opposing the socialist Soviet Union, and opposing the development of the anti-war and anti-fascist world peace movement and peace front. The other direction is the movement of the international workers' united front of various countries opposing the Munich Agreement, opposing fascist aggression, and defending the united front for world peace. The former direction will subject the masses of the people and weak nations to enslavement, will make imperialist wars even more rampant, and will make the crisis of a large-scale outbreak of world war even more imminent. The latter direction will enable the masses of the people and weak nations to gain freedom, independence, and liberation, to sanction and defeat fascist aggressors, and to guarantee world peace.</p>
<p>However, the current international situation, especially the situation after the fall of Barcelona and the entire Catalonia, has made the crisis of a larger-scale war even more urgent. The world situation is moving towards the prospect of war, and it will be difficult to avoid the fact that a global war will break out in a wide area.</p>
<p>The imminence and inevitability of war is the inevitable result of the development of capitalism. The unbalanced development of imperialism will use military conflicts and war to re-divide the already divided world. Japan, Germany, and Italy have already carried out and are carrying out wars against the people of China, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia, and Spain, and are now preparing to carry out wars to plunder other weak countries and colonies, and are even more preparing to carry out wars against the interests of powerful countries such as Britain, France, and the United States.</p>
<p>The imminence and inevitability of war is because the Munich Agreement gave the fascist aggressors of Germany, Italy, and Japan great encouragement, enabling them to occupy stronger positions and accumulate more strength to continue their more frenzied aggression.</p>
<p>The imminence and inevitability of war is the inevitable result of the "realism" of the British and French financial capital groups. "Realism" only makes the appetites of the fascist aggressors even greater, the demands and actions for plundering colonies even more urgent, and the blades of aggression even more aimed at the masters of "realism."</p>
<p>The imminence and inevitability of war is because many leaders of the Second International have still failed to sincerely implement the strategy of the anti-war and anti-fascist people's front, making the power of international labor unity and the power of the world peace front not enough to timely suppress the fascist offensive.</p>
<p>The crisis of war is even more imminent. It will not be satisfied with the current local areas. It will appear on a global scale. When the iron hooves of fascist aggression in Germany, Italy, and Japan have reached a level that Britain and France cannot tolerate, a great war will inevitably break out. This war will neither be a purely imperialist war nor an imperialist anti-Soviet war, but a war between two fronts, a war between the peace front and the aggression front.</p>
<p>2. The Madness of the Aggression Front</p>
<p>The appetite of the aggressors cannot be satisfied. The Munich Agreement has further strengthened the resistance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and further encouraged the aggressive atrocities of Germany, Italy, and Japan, making Germany, Italy, and Japan carry out more frenzied offensives.</p>
<p>The aggressors first consolidated the positions they had already obtained. Germany gradually grasped the entire Czechoslovakia from an economic, political, and military perspective. Italy consolidated Abyssinia and the occupied territories of the Western rebels. Japan attempted to consolidate its occupied territories in China, desperately carried out the organization of a "puppet central government," wanted to establish a "new order in East Asia" and form a "Japan-Manchuria-China Group," and attempted to monopolize China's interests and exclude the rights of Britain, the United States, and France in China, such as controlling the North China shipping industry, establishing the "Asia Development Board" in Central China, and blockading the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The aggressors then expanded their scope of attack. Germany provoked the fascist forces of various small countries to stir, suppressed Lithuania and in fact controlled Memel, oppressed Schleswig in Denmark, threatened the Netherlands and Poland, lured Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey with economic power, attempted to revive its "Three B Policy," incited riots in Palestine, strengthened its activities in South Africa, and strongly put forward demands for colonies. Italy mobilized more land, sea, and air forces to oppose the people of Spain, oppressed Switzerland, cooperated with Germany to lure Romania and Yugoslavia, attempted to control the Balkan Peninsula, deployed troops in North Africa to threaten Britain and France, put forward demands for colonies, and strongly demanded Tunisia and Corsica from France. Japan attacked South China, spied on Hainan Island, and expanded its conspiracy activities in the South Pacific Islands and the Pacific. The three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan jointly carried out fascist conspiracies in the Americas, especially in South America. The aggression of Germany, Italy, and Japan wanted to re-divide the colonies, and their frenzied blades were aimed at the interests of Britain, France, and the United States.</p>
<p>Therefore, the three countries of the aggressors felt the need to further unite from the Anti-Comintern Pact to a military alliance. Although the news of the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan has not yet been confirmed, and the secret signing of the alliance treaty between Germany and Italy has not been announced, from their mutual assistance in military, material, and military technology talents, from their mutual response in every aggressive action, especially Hitler's recent speech to the parliament, "reaffirming that Germany will assist Italy in wartime," and praising "Japan has shown many heroic examples in the past two years, and it is indeed fighting for culture on the other side of the world," it can be seen that Germany, Italy, and Japan already have closer military relations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aggressors carried out open military expansion. Germany used more than 400,000 workers to produce airplanes, demanded that submarines be equal to those of Britain, and forced men over the age of seventeen to wear national defense badges and join the military service. Italy engaged in the expansion of the sea, land, and air forces, and mobilized 500,000 reservists. Japan is also strengthening its general mobilization bill.</p>
<p>Just when Germany, Italy, and Japan were carrying out more frenzied offensives, the British and French financial capital groups also implemented many policies that helped the tigers, continuing to implement their "realism," "non-intervention" in Spain, withdrawing volunteer soldiers, "mediating" the war in Spain, and trying their best to approach Germany and Italy. The Anglo-German negotiations, the Anglo-Italian negotiations, and the Franco-Italian negotiations, scenes of the Franco-German declaration were staged, attempting to dismantle the close relationship between France and the Soviet Union, strengthen the friendship of the four powers, and form a front against the Soviet Union. At the same time, they had to strengthen their offensive against their own people. The most obvious manifestation was the promulgation of the law by legal order in France.</p>
<p>Although Britain and France temporarily eased the international situation with realism, they had to step up their arms expansion, because they had to maintain and consolidate their rule. They had to do so. The expansion of British and French armaments may indeed play a role in anti-aggression forces in an objective sense, but today they are trying to warn Germany and Italy not to aim their blades at themselves and to force Germany and Italy to truly be "anti-communist" crusaders and rush to Ukraine.</p>
<p>3. The Development of the Peace Front</p>
<p>In the state of coordination between Germany, Italy, and Japan and "realism," the peace front is also constantly developing, struggling hard, accumulating its own strength, and preparing to fight to the death with the aggression front. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Continued Fighting on Hainan Island; France Protests, Britain Decides to Negotiate; Southwest Headquarters to Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 12th] After the news that × landed on our Hainan Island on the morning of the 10th was transmitted, the reporter visited the person in charge of the headquarters on the evening of the 10th to inquire about the truth. It was reported that Hainan Island is purely an undefended rear. The sudden joint attack by × ×'s navy and army may be possible. It is currently only reported here that intense gunfire was heard in the northwest of the island, and at dawn, many × aircraft bombed the island. It is expected that the × army has landed. The headquarters is currently actively investigating and reporting. The reporter then asked what the impact of × ×'s landing would be. The person in charge continued, saying that from the perspective of Hainan Island's anti-Japanese military position, it is not important, because we are not a naval nation, so we do not need Haikou, and there is no supply relationship. It is speculated that the purpose of the × people's occupation of the island this time is nothing more than three points: First, to be a base for invading Annam, trying to echo Siam, and attempting to annex Annam; Second, to meet with the fleet stationed in Taiwan, posing a threat to the shipping lanes of Singapore and Hong Kong × × situation; Third, to cut off the connection between Guam and the Philippines and Singapore. Therefore, from a military perspective, the × army's invasion of Hainan Island is more of a direct provocation to Britain, France, and the United States than a further invasion of our country, which is more practical and reasonable.</p>
<p>[Foreign News from this Port] According to news received here this morning, Japanese gunboats sailed up the Nandu River from Haikou, firing cannons to bombard the Chinese army positions that were preventing the Japanese army from advancing. In addition, Japanese aircraft continued to operate along both banks of the river and in the northeast of Hainan Island. Japanese troops are actively dispatching aircraft in the northeast of the coast. This is a precursor to the Japanese army's plan to land in large numbers nearby. It is widely believed that Wenchang, six miles from the coast, may be the target of the Japanese army's invasion. At the same time, south of Qiongshan, the Chinese and Japanese armies are engaged in fierce fighting. However, due to the constant bombardment by Japanese artillery and aircraft, the Chinese army has now retreated further inland to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The number of Japanese troops landing in Haikou is even greater. Japanese warships, armed fishing boats, and steamships have now gathered in the Haikou area. It is also heard that a Japanese aircraft carrier has left Haikou for other destinations. According to general speculation, the Japanese army is planning a large-scale offensive to advance south to Ding'an, because there is a Chinese military and civilian checkpoint established there.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Tokyo Foreign News, the French ambassador to Japan met with the Japanese Foreign Minister today to protest against the Japanese army's attack on Hainan Island. [Foreign News from this Port] The French Far East flagship "Berimaki" was originally going to Bangkok. Because of the × invasion of Hainan, it has rushed back to Haiphong and is rushing to Haikou. Another unconfirmed news is that the ship has arrived in Haikou to protect overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] The British government intends to issue a note to Japan requesting an explanation for the Japanese army's invasion and occupation of Hainan Island. The United Kingdom has also decided to take consistent action with France.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, the British government is maintaining close contact with the French government. It is reported that the British government has decided to negotiate with the Japanese government on this matter, the nature of which is the same as that proposed by the French ambassador to Japan the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 12th] After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, the French government has negotiated with Japan. The British government, in accordance with the policy announced by Foreign Undersecretary Butler in the Lower House on June 27, 1938, namely a policy of close cooperation between Britain and France, instructed Sir Craigie, the British ambassador to Japan, to make the same negotiation with Japan. According to Undersecretary Butler, he declared to the Lower House on June 27 last year that if Japan occupies Hainan Island, Britain and France will immediately recognize it as deliberately causing unwelcome disputes. England's note is to adapt to the current situation and should help each other.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 13th] The Chinese military authorities said that, according to a survey conducted at the end of this week, there are more than 53 Japanese ships, including those landing on Hainan Island, along the coast of Guangdong. The Japanese army is still looking for opportunities to invade Beihai to attack Guangxi. A certain aspect said that a senior Chinese military officer and a well-known strategist who recently inspected the war zones reported to the headquarters that they were deeply impressed by the recent progress of the Chinese Air Force. The first-class Chinese bombers and fighters have increased several times compared with the beginning of the war, so that the Japanese army will not send its old-fashioned aircraft to various places for air raids and air battles. According to Chinese newspapers here, on February 6, the Chinese Air Force flew to Wuchang to bomb the railway and the Japanese military's defense line, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>[Guilin, 12th] The Southwest Headquarters is scheduled to hold a military conference in Guilin. All commanders above the division level in the three war zones will come to Guilin to participate. The battle situation on Hainan Island is still unknown here, but it is heard that a certain commander has ordered the garrison commander Wang Yi to command the troops under his command to work hard to resist the war.</p>
<p>[Haisha News Agency, Shanghai, 13th] According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army in Haikou, Qiongzhou, is now retreating into the mountains and is being reorganized by General Wang Yi before continuing to fight bravely against the Japanese army.</p>
<p>[Haisha News Agency, Shanghai, 13th] The Japanese army on the island feels uneasy because there are 50,000 regular Chinese troops and guerrillas in its occupied area with a strong force, so it will mobilize mechanized troops in an attempt to take a siege.</p>
<p>[Foreign News from this Port] After the Japanese army occupied Haikou, it forcibly occupied the customs yesterday, ordering the tax affairs officer, the American Smith, to hand over the affairs. Under coercion, Smith argued with reason but to no avail. The customs has fallen into ×'s hands. In addition, the people of Haikou are unwilling to be obedient and have fled one after another. After × arrived, they occupied government agencies and schools and planned to form a puppet maintenance association. According to foreign news from Guangzhou Bay, villages and towns on the northeast coast of Hainan Island were heavily bombed yesterday. An Ding, twenty miles south of Qiongzhou, was on fire everywhere. On both sides of the Qiongzhou River, our defending troops and × are still engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>The Dongjiang Front is Strongly Arranged; × Attacked Zhangmutou Yesterday and Bombed Tangtouxia Area</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Weng Yuan, 13th] More than 2,000 × soldiers from Sanshui Southwest have withdrawn one after another in recent days. Currently, there are only more than 400 × soldiers in that area, about 300 × in Hekou, and more than 100 × in Makou. Our army is currently advancing.</p>
<p>[Awakening News Agency, Shenzhen Quick News] After Ao Qiyi led his troops to Dongjiang, Dongguan, Baoan, Huiyang, and Zengcheng have all been strongly arranged on the front line. Various guerrilla teams are also very active, so × is panicked. The day before yesterday, five cavalry units were sent from Guangzhou to Dongguan City. Yesterday (13th) at 6:00 a.m., they joined the more than 200 infantry and artillery soldiers originally stationed in Dongguan City, divided into two teams. One team went straight to Zhangmutou along the Guangjiu Road, and the other team went straight to Zhangmutou along the Huizhang Highway. At about 7:00 a.m., the × cavalry rushed in. Our team waited for × to reach the shooting range and jumped out to meet the attack, and a war broke out. Shenzhen also faintly heard gunfire for tens of minutes. Because our team was outnumbered, they shifted their position along the Huizhang Highway (Huizhou Zhangmutou). Yesterday morning at 9:00, when × attacked Nanshe Zhangmutou, there were also four × aircraft flying from outside Humenkou to Guangjiu Road, covering the × pushing carts, and then carried out fierce bombing in the Tangtouxia, Guanlan, and Changping areas. After investigation, it was found that seven bombs fell in Tangtouxia, eight bombs fell in the Guanlan countryside, and several bombs fell at Changping Station on Guangjiu Road. All of them were small bombs of 50 to 100 pounds.</p>
<p>[Xiao Hang Quick News] More than 60 × soldiers sailed into the vicinity of Dahuangpu in the ninth district of Zhongshan County on two motorboats on the 12th, intending to land. The first district guerrilla detachment and the ninth detachment of the third guerrilla district stationed there immediately fired at × from the shore, hitting them head-on. After about two hours, × could not hold on and collapsed to Lelou. Mu Huangpu and its vicinity are as peaceful as usual.</p>
<h3>Sha Wang Visited Lin, Stated the Current Situation in Suiyuan and Mongolia, and the Chairman Comforted Him Greatly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] State Councilor Sha Wang visited the Chairman at 10:00 a.m. on the 13th. The Chairman comforted Sha Wang for coming from afar again to report on his duties and working hard for the country, and inquired in detail about the current situation in Suiyuan and Mongolia. Sha Wang reported to the Chairman and paid his respects before leaving at 10:30.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Forcibly Collects Gold from the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Tokyo News, at least 100,000 households in × nationwide will be ordered by their Ministry of Finance to sell the metal objects they have stored to the government. According to the recent gold survey, at least 100,000 households have gold coins, gold watches, watch chains, and other gold objects stored. The Ministry of Finance recently announced in Parliament that the government is working hard to increase domestic gold production, so under the war economy plan, it is imperative to forcibly collect gold stored by the people through legislative procedures. The lack of gold is conceivable.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issued a Statement; the Property of the Embassy in Japan Was Occupied; Japan Should Bear Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] According to recent news from × Tongmeng News Agency, people sent to Japan by the puppet organizations in Nanjing and Peiping illegally occupied the property of our embassy in Japan at the beginning of the month. Regarding this matter, our spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a statement as follows: When the Chinese Ambassador to Japan was ordered to withdraw last year, he compiled a catalog of all the property and real estate of the embassy and sent it to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to arrange for personnel to take inventory and be responsible for safekeeping. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent personnel to jointly handle the matter with the personnel designated by the embassy in accordance with the law, and sealed all the doors of the embassy. At the same time, in accordance with the Japanese request, the safekeeping fee was handed over to the Japanese side for receipt. At the same time, the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kuniaki Horiuchi, replied to Mr. Yang, the Chargé d'Affaires of our embassy, saying that the property of our embassy should be fully protected in accordance with the principles of international law. Then the Japanese government not only bears the responsibility for the safekeeping of our embassy's property under international law, but also formally accepted this responsibility in fact. Now they have instigated personnel from the puppet organization to invade and occupy the property of our embassy. This not only violates international public law, but also despises international credibility. Recalling that after the personnel of the Japanese embassy in China withdrew from Nanjing in August of the year before last, we strictly protected the property of the Japanese embassy at all times. The condition of the embassy remained unchanged until the Japanese army invaded Nanjing. The Japanese side also expressed admiration for this point. Compared with the Japanese side's violation of its promise, what is the difference? The Japanese government is indeed obliged to take care of the property of our embassy in Japan. In the future, if it is found that the property of the embassy has changed in any way from the situation at the time of sealing, the Japanese government should bear full responsibility.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Harvest, Captured More than a Thousand Floating ×; Obtained Many Weapons and Ammunition</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 13th] The Chinese military told reporters that in January of this year, Chinese guerrillas fought with the Japanese army 258 times in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces.

<h3>Patriotic Youths Demonstrate in Shanghai, Attack Puppet Police Station, Destroy Gambling Dens, Eliminate All Traitors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] At 7:50 this morning, a group of Chinese youths arrived at the "Great Way Municipal Government" police station on Avenue Petain. After completely destroying two lottery selling agencies nearby, they lectured the puppet police on patriotism and slapped the faces of several officers. Before leaving, they distributed leaflets, ordering the police not to assist the Japanese in establishing gambling dens, opium dens, and other evils. The youths then went to a branch of the "Great Way Municipal Government" Public Security Bureau, firing more than ten shots inside. A large group of people followed the youths, and when they reached Route Cardinal Mercier, a Chinese policeman stepped forward to stop them and was struck a fierce blow by one of the youths, causing him to immediately retreat. While the youths were active in the area, they were not interfered with by the "Great Way Municipal Government" police or suppressed by the Japanese military police in charge of the area. They reportedly dispersed near Zhaofeng Park.</p>

<h3>Bai Chongxi Speaks on Progress Since the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>At the Expanded Memorial Week in Yunnan</p>
<p>[Kunming Special Telegram] The first thing I want to report to everyone is my impressions of Yunnan. Yunnan is an important base in the rear of the War of Resistance and a vital international thoroughfare. To the south, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway connects to Annam, and through Annam you can reach India. To the west, the Yunnan-Burma Road leads to Europe via Burma. To the east, the Xu Kun Road leads along the river to the Pacific Ocean, and if you continue north from Hankou, you can also reach Europe. Yunnan is not only located at the crossroads of international transportation, but also has simple customs, a mild climate, and rich resources. It is a base for national revival, because the base for national revival is in the southwest, and Yunnan is the most important town in the southwest. Therefore, the revival of the Chinese nation must begin in Yunnan. As for the historical aspect, when the Republic of China was founded and Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, Yunnan was the first to rise up, overthrow the imperial system, and restore the democratic Republic of China. This is Yunnan's most glorious page in history. Especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Yunnan has contributed the greatest manpower and material resources to the country. Those who participated in the war on the front line all fought as one against ten, heroically and valiantly. This is the result of Chairman Chu Long's efforts to govern. We also hope that under the leadership of Chairman Long, Yunnan can become the Ankara of Turkey and serve as the base for the revival of our Republic of China. Now that our War of Resistance has entered its second stage, I will now raise several important issues in the second phase of the War of Resistance:</p>
<p>Establish the Party's Program for War of Resistance and Nation-Building</p>
<p>If we want to do revolutionary work, we must have a group, an organization. Only with a strong organization can we lead the revolutionary forces to fight and work hard, and only then can the revolution succeed. The Kuomintang is the party that saves the country and the people, and the Three Principles of the People is the doctrine that saves the country and the people. In the past, it overthrew the Manchus and overthrew the Northern Warlords. Now it is leading the people of the whole country to shoulder the mission of national revolution and the heavy burden of future national revival. Because it is a revolutionary political party, it can shoulder this important mission. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, our party convened the Provisional National Congress and decided on the program for War of Resistance and Nation-Building, which became our guidelines for the War of Resistance. At the same time, it also produced the "Three Principles of the People Youth League" and the "National Political Council", one representing the will of the youth and the other representing the national public opinion. No matter what party or faction, as long as they can abandon the previous doctrine, leave the past parties, obey the leader, and participate in the sacred War of Resistance, they can join us. Our Fifth Plenary Session also had important resolutions on the War of Resistance, especially in party affairs work, paying more attention to grassroots work and grassroots organizations. Because the foundation of the party is built on grassroots work. In the past, more emphasis was placed on the upper levels and the lower levels were neglected, making the War of Resistance organization unable to function. This is still the biggest mistake. Now that we have discovered this shortcoming, we must correct it. The way to correct it is to use clean youth, go deep into the people, lead the people, and organize the people to jointly seek the revival of China. Recently, a few people are still slandering the Kuomintang, believing that it cannot lead the people of China. I dare to say that this erroneous thinking is caused by not deeply studying the President's will, or is intentional sabotage. And there are some people who are afraid of the Red Disease, and are even afraid that after the end of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang will be replaced by the Communist Party. This kind of psychology is also an excessive concern. Is it not the Kuomintang that is leading the War of Resistance now? Since it is leading the people of the whole country to resist the war, it is naturally an organization for the whole country's resistance war. Moreover, today the Communist Party has sincerely obeyed the Central Government, abandoned the previous class struggle, and is uniting to do the work of national struggle. Facts speak louder than words, so I won't say more. What China needs now is national struggle, not class struggle. In fact, China has no big landlords or big capitalists at all, so we don't have to be afraid of it, and we don't have to discriminate against it, but we should slowly dissolve it. Only pro-Japanese factions are willing to promote anti-communist propaganda. Only in this way can they use the widely used three principles as an excuse to destroy China. We should not be deceived by them again.</p>
<p>Strengthen Grassroots Political Organizations</p>
<p>In the political aspect, since the July 7th Incident, we have achieved a unity that has never been seen in 5,000 years of history. We have truly achieved that there is no distinction between north and south, and no distinction between men, women, old and young. Everyone is standing on the same line. The unity of the past imperial era was a kind of forced and hegemonic unity, but now it is a unity of purpose, and we have realized that we cannot save the country without unity and struggle. But in the 19 months of political mobilization, although we have achieved our wishes, we have not yet achieved the spirit of democracy and the rule of law, and we still attach importance to the upper level and not the lower level. Especially bad is the problem of grassroots administrative organs close to the people, such as the village and town chiefs, who have not really shouldered the mission of mobilizing the people. When it comes to mobilizing the people, there are four stages: first, arousing the people; second, organizing the people; third, training the people; and fourth, applying the people. We are now about to apply the people. If we want to apply the people, we must first mobilize the passionate youth. Because youth is bold and promising, youth is progressive, youth is pure, youth is the pillar of the country, and youth is the cornerstone of building the country. (Applause from ten thousand people) Therefore, we must mobilize the youth to shoulder the heavy responsibility of grassroots in this war of resistance and nation-building. The second point worth reporting is that the Party and Government Committees have been established in the Pinghan guerrilla areas to establish the regime in the occupied areas, in order to prevent the Japanese from using the poisonous plan of controlling with Chinese. In the past, the Japanese used our money to train our people to invade our land. Therefore, we have now established Party and Government Committees to eliminate local puppet organizations, so that they cannot seduce our people. For example, and Chahar, as well as various guerrilla areas, we have sent provincial chairmen, not only to prevent the people from moving outward, but also to cooperate with the strategy and achieve the effect of political mobilization.

<h3>On the Spanish Question: England and France Agree; Rebel Aircraft Vigorously Bomb Madrid; Spanish Government Declares Determination to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 12th] Regarding the Spanish question, political figures here recently stated that although the Spanish government has moved back to Madrid, the situation in the civil war has not changed significantly. The move by Western European countries to recognize the rebel government as the legitimate government need not be delayed as a result. Even if the government army continues to resist, it may not be able to sustain itself for long, and the fact that the rebel government now controls three-quarters of Spain's territory will be difficult to change. As such, the recognition of the rebels by various countries need not depend entirely on how long the Spanish government continues to resist. According to news from Madrid, there are internal disagreements within the government regarding the overall plan for the War of Resistance. The main purpose of continuing the resistance is probably to put pressure on the rebel authorities in order to obtain more lenient armistice terms. Therefore, the key to how the British and French governments will act towards Spain in the future lies not in the nature and position of the Spanish government after its relocation, but in the political calculations of Britain and France themselves.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 13th] Regarding the question of recognizing the Franco government, opinions are still being exchanged between here and London. The French cabinet meeting will be held on Tuesday (the 14th), chaired by President Lebrun, so France's decision or any initial actions must be announced at that time. According to "The Times," France's policy is still to seek assurances from Franco that he will cancel his close relationship with Italy, because Britain and France can only recognize a free and independent Spain.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 12th] Spanish government officials held their first cabinet meeting this afternoon after arriving here. Interior Minister Gomez said, "We are very happy to have returned to Madrid. I cannot make any statements at this time, as we have only arrived here a few hours ago. We held a meeting in Valencia, and this meeting will continue that meeting. I really don't know how long this meeting will continue." Later, the government issued a letter to the people in the unravaged areas, stating, "As Madrid holds its first cabinet meeting, the government wishes to warmly congratulate our loyal and brave land, sea, and air forces and patriotic people. The government has a very difficult task ahead, but it is determined to make its best efforts to overcome difficulties and complete it."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Madrid, 13th] Yesterday, before the cabinet members of the Republican government arrived here, rebel forces bombed Madrid for half an hour.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 13th] According to news here, a large number of rebel aircraft flew to Madrid on Sunday and carried out a horrific bombing, dropping 120 bombs, killing 16 people and injuring over 100 people.</p>
<h3>It is Widely Rumored in British Political Circles that Germany is Intensifying Mobilization, Preparing to Provoke New International Disputes, and Will Soon Make Strong Demands in Conjunction with Italy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] The "Literary News" here, based on information from British political circles, reported that Germany is now intensifying various military preparations to deal with future international disputes. It is said that this international dispute will occur on March 6th or 7th when Italy makes demands to Britain and France. According to the newspaper's Berlin correspondent, it has been confirmed that Germany has mobilized 95% of its air force with all its strength. The recruitment of new soldiers began on the 10th of this month, but the mobilization order will be implemented from the 15th to the 18th of this month. After the mobilization is implemented, all men between the ages of 25 and 30 must enlist. Germany's mobilization is expected to be completed between March 3rd and 6th, at which time Germany and Italy can jointly make strong demands. The newspaper also reported that on the 7th of this month, the German military ordered the authorities in the Rhine region, Westphalia, Hanover, Bavaria, and Warburg to issue gas masks to residents from February 26th to March 10th. Gas masks do not need to be distributed in Frankfurt, Louis Port, Giesel Salzburg, Trier, and Cologne, because residents there should evacuate in case of war. The British and French governments believe that the above news is not surprising, because Germany's move is actually something that expected. The newspaper recently reported that the German Foreign Minister told the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union that he was very uneasy about France's intervention in the Spanish war and demanded that France immediately stop interfering in this event and that the French authorities must fulfill the German-French Declaration of December 6th and consult each other on matters related to Germany and France. However, the French Foreign Ministry strongly denied this news, speaking for Italy.</p>
<h3>Polish Newspaper Speaks for Italy</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 11th] The "International Relations" weekly newspaper provided a summary explanation of Italy's attitude toward France's demand for the return of colonies, saying, "Although the Fascist Italian government has not yet formally made a request for colonies, the Italian people's desire is to prevent any interference in Italy's development in the Mediterranean. From a historical perspective, Tunisia, Suez, and Gibraltar should all belong to Italy. The return of Corsica to Italy is even more beyond doubt and should be decided quickly. If France does not have sincerity in the above issues, Italy will not hesitate to resort to force to resolve the issues. At this time, Italy and Germany will unite against France." The weekly further discussed the Spanish question, saying that the Italian army would not withdraw from Spain until Franco's position was consolidated and France's policy toward Spain was clearly defined.</p>
<h3>US Naval Maneuvers: President Will Inspect; Held Simultaneously in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans; 60,000 Naval Officers and Men Participating</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The US Pacific and Atlantic Fleets are preparing for the second phase of exercises at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the progress of the offensive and defensive exercises in the Panama Canal Zone is highly confidential. The exercises have now been completed. Tomorrow morning, the White Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Carle, will launch an attack on the Panama Canal Zone, while the Black Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Andres, will be responsible for defense. The offensive and defensive plans are unknown to both sides, and reports will be sent using codes. Commander-in-Chief Admiral Bullock will then judge the winner based on the reports. President Roosevelt will travel to the Canal Zone on the 16th of this month aboard the cruiser Houston to observe part of the exercises. The exercises will last for three weeks, involving a total of 140 ships of various sizes, 600 aircraft, and 60,000 naval officers and men. The location stretches from the coast of Florida in the north to the northern coast of Brazil in the south. This is the first time in five years that the US Navy has conducted exercises in the Atlantic Ocean Bank.</p>
<h3>Hull's Broadcast</h3>
<p>Maintaining World Peace Requires Strong National Defense</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, December 12th] U.S. Secretary of State Hull broadcasted to the world today, stating that in the current world situation, maintaining a sufficient national defense capability is the sacred duty of a responsible government. Since the specter of a new great war has appeared in the world, the relationship between war and peace is extremely important, and no one is unaffected by it. Hull concluded by saying, "From a national standpoint, we firmly believe that all international disputes can be resolved peacefully, but realistically, countries that desire to maintain peace may be hindered by other countries."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, December 13th] Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a broadcast speech to the world, the content of which is tantamount to opposing President Roosevelt's proposal to convene an international disarmament conference. Hull declared that people around the world are now daily concerned about large-scale armed conflicts. In this day and age, strengthening national defense is the sacred responsibility of the government. Observers believe that Hull's enthusiastic support for President Roosevelt's national defense plan is evident. On the other hand, Hull opposes any suggestion that the United States should take the lead in initiating negotiations between governments that are politically and economically opposed to each other, so that the current arms race can be halted. Although Hull did not specifically address the above-mentioned suggestions, he solemnly pointed out that the fundamental cause of war is primarily economic, so efforts must first be made to eliminate this primary cause in order to achieve a practical solution to the current problems. Hull also stated that modern warfare is extremely complex, and the United States, as well as any other country, could be drawn into a great war against its will. Any government that truly has the national interest at heart should strive to fulfill its responsibilities, seek to maintain adequate defense capabilities, and at the same time, utilize perfect peaceful mechanisms and eliminate the various causes that lead to war, day and night, in order to prevent the outbreak of war. The United States is sincerely committed to world peace, but at the same time, the people of the United States are also deeply aware that modern warfare has a direct impact on the people of all countries, and the harm it causes is difficult for the world to avoid. The United States believes that the resolution of international disputes does not require resorting to force, although the United States, both government and public, is also aware that the situation may change suddenly, at which time the willingness of some countries to maintain peace may be hindered by the actions of other countries.</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to Establish New Trans-North Atlantic Route</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, December 12th] American Airlines has recently submitted an application to the Civil Aeronautics Authority requesting to open a regular trans-North Atlantic route. Its starting point will be selected from New York, Baltimore, Boston, and Charleston. After this route is opened, it will only take 25 hours to fly from the United States to France and only 30 hours to fly to the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary: War Clouds Over the Holy Land</h3>
<p>War spirits shrouding the holy city of Jerusalem and even the entire Palestine region are not news, especially since the German invasion maniac Hitler came to power, colluding with the Italian aggressors in Europe and the Japanese aggressors in the East, actively launching a world war. This glorious and great holy land has become a target for Fascist aggressors to harass. However, the war has been intermittent, and the situation has never been as serious as it is today. Just look at Chamberlain's personal attendance at the Palestine Conference to see how tense the situation is.</p>
<p>The emergence of war spirits in the Holy Land, although due to the ethnic struggle between Jews and Arabs, actually has its own background, which is an open secret. In particular, since the establishment of the Munich Agreement and the recent Italian victory in Spain, the appeasement policy of the British and French rulers has become more obvious and thorough, making the German and Italian aggressors even more rampant. Palestine is the birthplace of ancient civilization in the middle of the Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Red Sea, and it is also a vital transportation hub between Europe and Asia today. It has a very important position economically, militarily, and politically. Therefore, the Holy Land has become a new target for German and Italian aggressors. They have recently been actively instigating the "Independence and Nation-Building Movement" of the Arabs, attempting to threaten Britain to cede colonies as the first step for German and Italian Fascists to advance into the Asian continent. Although the British rulers have not expressed this actively, they are also actively supporting the Jews to oppose the demands of the Arabs. Therefore, war clouds fill the Holy Land, and Jerusalem rarely has a peaceful day.</p>
<p>We believe that the war clouds over the Holy Land are a further manifestation of the German aggressors' threat to Britain, and they are a further manifestation of the Fascists trampling on culture and threatening Asia. We further believe that the effective way to sweep away the dark clouds over the Holy Land is, first, to require the British government to adopt a correct policy, on the one hand, to use strength to counter the eastward spread of the Fascist aggressors' forces, and on the other hand, to implement a policy of equal survival for the people, so that the two ancient civilized nations of Palestine, Jewish and Arab, can survive freely, coexist equally, and develop together with mutual assistance. The second is to require the two ethnic groups to each enhance their ancient civilized national self-esteem, abandon the speculative path of using aggressors to seek freedom, realize a united national front against Fascist aggression, and assist each other equally to seek national liberation. The third is to require the countries of the Near East to quickly establish mutual agreements, establish a collective security system, and jointly resist the Fascist aggressor forces that are advancing eastward.</p>
<p>Finally, due to the war spirits in the Holy Land, we are even more convinced that Fascist aggressors are indeed the tramplers of human civilization—and any policy of appeasement towards Fascist aggressors will only aggravate the threat to human civilization and world peace! The forces of German and Italian aggressors have directly invaded Asia, and we must mobilize all forces to stop them!</p>
<h3>The Late Pope to be Entombed Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, December 12th] The Pope's remains were placed in a coffin in St. Peter's Basilica today. 500,000 people paid their respects to the remains.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Vatican City, December 13th] The ceremony for the entombment of Pope Pius XI is scheduled to take place tomorrow at 4 p.m.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Restoration in Spain: Rebel Army Favors Deposed Crown Prince Juan; British Political Circles Advocate Non-Interference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, December 12th] Regarding the future political system of Spain, British political figures firmly maintain that no pressure should be exerted on General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army in that country. In other words, whether the country restores the monarchy should be decided by him. According to news from the city of Burgos in that country, the rebel army seems to intend to have the deposed Crown Prince Juan succeed to the throne. If this is true, it may be the best method of unification, because the royal family did not participate in the civil war, and its position is more detached.</p>
<h3>Increasingly Tense Soviet-Japanese Relations: War Imminent: Opinions of Foreign Military Observers</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Correspondent, December 14th] Soviet-Japanese relations are becoming increasingly tense. Foreign military observers believe that the Japanese army is fighting in a vast area of China and already has insufficient military strength. Now that it is also at odds with the Soviet Union, its "feet of clay" will be further exposed, and it will have to withdraw some troops from China to defend against the Soviet Union. According to an investigation by the Associated Press, the reasons for the deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations are as follows: (1) Disputes over fishing agreements; (2) Soviet-"Manchukuo" border conflicts; (3) Rumors of the seizure of Japanese ships in Soviet territorial waters; (4) Unfair treatment of Soviet diplomatic representatives in Japan; (5) Disputes over Sakhalin oil fields; (6) Active Soviet aid to China; (7) Some members of the Japanese parliament demanded a satisfactory resolution of the Soviet-Japanese fishing agreement and other issues immediately, otherwise war should be declared on the Soviet Union. Recent developments in the international situation will have serious consequences for Soviet-Japanese relations. Important international events include: (1) The possibility of a relaxation of German-Soviet relations; (2) The recent "moderate" speeches by Chamberlain and Hitler have increasingly eased the situation in Europe, which has a considerable impact on Japan's superior position in the Far East and the effectiveness of the anti-communist axis; (3) The United States' plan to strengthen the defense of Guam and other important bases. Although the current international situation is very unfavorable to Japan, there are still those in the Japanese army who advocate declaring war on the Soviet Union, especially the Kwantung Army stationed in "Manchukuo." The reasons are: (1) Occupying Vladivostok to eliminate the threat of the Soviet air force to Japan; (2) Believing that air warfare against the Soviet Union can implement the National General Mobilization Law and make Japan a truly military dictatorship. According to recent foreigners arriving from Japan, a Soviet-Japanese war will break out within June. Some Japanese people from Japan have also expressed similar opinions. Foreign officers here believe that the current Soviet-"Manchukuo" border is explosive.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Does Not Plan to Visit Europe Now: May Travel Abroad if Not Re-elected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, December 12th] The continental edition of the London "Daily Mail" recently reported that the ambassadors of three European countries to the United States had inquired whether President Roosevelt could come to Europe for a visit. The U.S. government immediately indicated that the President would not have time to travel abroad during his term of office. Political figures here attach great importance to the so-called "during his term of office." In New York, it is believed that when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom originally planned to visit the United States in June, they would invite President and Mrs. Roosevelt to visit the United Kingdom in person. Whether President Roosevelt makes the trip depends on whether he runs for re-election in the 1940 election. If he does not run, he may accept the invitation. Otherwise, if the situation in Europe becomes increasingly serious, leading to war, and Europe can convene an international conference to discuss ways to eliminate the scourge of war, then President Roosevelt should not hesitate to travel to Europe.</p>
<h3>The Danger of Japan</h3>

<p>1938 68% 32%</p>
<p>Comparing Japan's industry today with that before the Mukden Incident, civilian and military needs have exactly reversed positions, and the Japanese policy's violation of people's livelihood is even more obvious.</p>
<p>With the abnormal development of heavy industry, there is an imbalance in foreign trade, resulting in a trade deficit. Because Japan lacks raw materials for both heavy and light industry, and with Japan's low purchasing power, especially during this time of war, if military raw materials suddenly increase, then civilian raw materials will inevitably suffer a major blow. In the past year, Japan's domestic wool imports decreased by 82%, raw cotton and wheat decreased by 67%, and hemp, rubber, and lumber decreased by 52%. However, imports of its main heavy industrial raw materials decreased by only 1%. Therefore, we can even more clearly understand that Japan's reserves are becoming less and less. However, its imports of military raw materials often depend on the exports of domestic light industry to make up for it. The most important of Japan's light industrial products is textiles. In the past year, the average monthly import of raw cotton decreased from more than 1.3 million to 900,000 bales, and the average monthly production of cotton yarn also decreased by 25%. Due to this imbalance, Japan's foreign purchasing power is gradually weakening, and domestic prices are soaring even more.</p>
<p>At the same time, the flourishing boycott movement in democratic countries around the world has made the Japanese authorities feel uneasy, as if sitting on pins and needles. According to recent statistics from Japan, since December 1937, the prices of Japanese goods exported abroad have decreased rather than increased. The total value of Japanese goods exported in 1937 was 317.5 million yen, an increase of 48.2 million yen, or 18%, compared to 269.3 million yen in 1936. However, at the end of 1937, the value of Japanese goods exported began to decrease compared to the same month last year. Every month in 1938 decreased compared to the same month in 1937. The percentage decrease in the amount of Japanese goods imported by several major countries is as follows:</p>
<p>Straits Settlements...75%</p>
<p>Soviet Union...72%</p>
<p>British Malaya...66%</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies...48%</p>
<p>United States...48%</p>
<p>Philippines...34%</p>
<p>Canada...28%</p>
<p>India...27%</p>
<p>South Africa...24%</p>
<p>United Kingdom...9%</p>
<p>Among the above countries, except for the Soviet Union, most were importers of Japanese goods before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The country that purchased the most Japanese goods among these countries was the United States, accounting for 33.65 million yen in the first half of 1937. Although it decreased by nearly half in the first half of 1938, it was still 17.49 million yen, while the Soviet Union's imports of Japanese goods in 1938 were less than 3 million yen. The decrease in exports of Japanese goods has dealt a major blow to Japan's war expenses in invading China. Japan's foreign loans have mostly been rejected. Except for the two countries of Germany and Italy, which are struggling to take care of themselves, there is little hope for success. However, its trade deficit is still increasing. More than one-third of its cash reserves have been depleted. Since cash is scarce, loans are not easy to obtain, and the trade deficit is still on the rise, under this situation, Japan has no power to continue its aggression, but instead makes its national system fall into a difficult quagmire. In addition, since all countries have a bad feeling towards Japan, if it does not get foreign aid, then even a month of large-scale war will be difficult to support. What the Japanese people need is "peace," and to live in peace. If it continues to support the war of aggression against China, then domestic revolution will happen quickly. If the military dictatorship continues, the economic burden will become heavier day by day, and international resentment will increase, then Japan will be bound by a net of overlapping hatred.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 2:30 p.m., High Court Justice McKinley opened the trial of this month's criminal cases, as well as two criminal cases postponed from last month, totaling twelve cases. (1) Yong An Building Bloodshed Case: Defendant Huang Shulun, also known as Li Xiu, was tried by Justice McKinley. Deputy Attorney William prosecuted, stating that the accomplice was guilty of (1) injuring British Detective Mothalie with intent to murder, (2) shooting Mothalie with intent to injure his body, and (3) illegally possessing a short gun and bullets. The defendant denied the first charge, but admitted the other two charges. Prosecutor Williams stood up and presented the case to the judge. The judge said, "The crimes you have committed this time are very serious. Before sentencing, do you have any self-defense?" The defendant said, "I am very sorry for what happened the other day. I am very happy that Police Detective Mothalie was able to survive this time. I was nervous that night, which led to mental disorder. Since this is the case, I can only express my deepest apologies to him and hope for a lenient sentence." The judge said, "The crimes you have admitted to now are also serious. If this court does not regard the shooting of the police as a serious matter, then this court believes it is derelict in its duty. Although the defendant expressed his happiness that Mothalie was able to survive, the shooting caused him to suffer the same pain of death or dismemberment." After saying this, he sentenced him to 14 years of hard labor for the second crime and two years of hard labor for the third crime, to be served concurrently.</p>
<p>Violent Robbery Cases Have Increased Sharply in the Last Six Months</p>
<p>(1) Man Hong Wangfu was charged with (A) robbing Chen Zhuyan of a gun in Repulse Bay on January 9th of this year, and (B) injuring an old woman, Zhang Hao. Government lawyer Brandi prosecuted. Both defendants pleaded guilty. Justice Massie said, "In the criminal case last month, the court instructed the police to prepare a statistical table of violent robberies. Has this been completed now?" Brandi said, "It has been completed now." Detective Assistant Wan Diden took the stand to testify. According to the investigation, "robbery cases often occur during the months from August of each year to January of the following year, in other words, the six months before the Chinese New Year. It has now been found that violent robberies (injuring people during the robbery) in the six months before January 31st of this year have increased by 36 cases compared to the six months before January 1938. In 1938, the number of robbery cases was 51, and in 1938 it reached 87. This is an increase of 71%. In 1934, the number of robbery cases (burglary, street robbery, violent robbery, etc.) was 54, in 1935 it was 83, in 1936 it was 65, in 1937 it was 102, and in 1938 it was 116." After the testimony was completed,</p>
<p>Increased by 70% Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>Justice Massie said, "After returning to Hong Kong from a two-month vacation, I discovered that there are many more cases of violent robbery than before. I believe that in addition to sentencing these evil criminals who injure people during robbery to imprisonment, they should also be flogged as a warning. In terms of percentage, I have learned that recent violent robbery cases have increased by 98% compared to five years ago, and by 71.6% compared to last year. The two defendants robbed a single gun together, which can be said to be the most foolish people in the world. However, the second defendant actually pushed a weak old woman into the ditch, causing her to be injured, which is an even more serious crime. Since the doctor examined your body and said that you cannot withstand flogging, this court considers it unfortunate. Now, the first defendant is sentenced to two years of hard labor, but the second defendant, Wangfu, is sentenced to three and a half years of hard labor."</p>
<p>Violent Actions Punished Severely</p>
<p>(3) Man Huang Sheng was previously charged with two counts of violently robbing a Western woman and a Chinese woman of their handbags. The judge sentenced the defendant to six years of hard labor. (4) Man Huang Wen was charged with deportation. The judge sentenced him to four years of hard labor. (5) Man Chen Daming, also known as Zhou Risheng, was charged with returning after deportation. The judge sentenced him to three years of hard labor. (6) Man Li Cun, also known as Wu Sheng, was charged with deportation. The judge sentenced him to four years of hard labor. (7) Men Zhong Yue and Chen Kun were charged with possessing a short gun and 26 bullets in Tai Po Market on January 14th of this year. The judge sentenced both defendants to two years of hard labor each. (8) Men Liang and He Baiyou were charged with burglary of gold jewelry on January 14th of this year. The judge sentenced each defendant to five years of hard labor and 12 lashes.</p>
<p>In Addition to Imprisonment, Whipping</p>
<p>(9) Man Zheng was charged with violently robbing Feng Luo of 60 yuan in cash on January 25th of this year. The judge sentenced him to four years of hard labor and 12 lashes. (10) Men Huang Qi (27 years old) and Mao Qiang (26 years old) were charged with (A) armed robbery, (B) receiving stolen goods, and (C) privately possessing military firearms. The judge sentenced the first defendant to six years of hard labor and flogging, and the second defendant to seven years of hard labor and 12 lashes. (11) Man He Zong was charged with (A) beating Guan Xingji in Fanling on the 17th of last month with intent to rob, and (B) beating Guan with intent to injure his body. The defendant only admitted the second charge. The prosecuting government lawyer did not proceed with the first charge. The judge sentenced the defendant to one year of hard labor. (12) Man Ding Hong was charged with robbing the Yi Sheng money exchange shop at 347 Avenue West on the 26th of last month, and (B) privately possessing 14 bullets and a pistol. The judge sentenced him to seven years of hard labor and flogging for the first crime, and two years of hard labor for the second crime, to be served concurrently. Other cases that have not been adjudicated will be heard again at a later date.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Radio Station Broadcast Yesterday: Foreigners in Kuling Should Evacuate Quickly: The Japanese Plan to Launch a Major Offensive on the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>After repeatedly attacking Kuling and being repelled by our local defending forces, the war has continued to this day. Recently, the Japanese again declared their intention to launch an offensive. Some foreigners living in Kuling wanted to go down the mountain to escape the danger zone, but it was extremely difficult to communicate with the outside world, and it was also not easy for the British naval authorities to transmit messages to Kuling. For this reason, the Hong Kong naval authorities specially broadcast a report on the Hong Kong radio station yesterday to foreigners trapped in Kuling, which said: "The Japanese attack on Kuling has been rescheduled to February 20th, so that foreigners in Kuling who wish to evacuate can evacuate early. Since British and American military officers cannot pass through the defense zone, foreigners should discuss with the Chinese military regarding safety when passing through the defense zone. After arriving at the Japanese defense zone, there may be someone to meet you. Please notify the British and American naval authorities in Kuling of the date and route of departure in advance."</p>

<h3>Sino-British Border at Man Kam To: Three Robbers Armed with Weapons Intercept and Rob; Two Robbers Flee into the Chinese Territory and are Intercepted and Captured by Our Defense Forces; Cargo Boat Robbed of Seven Hundred Dollars in Waters off Tung Ku</h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, a general increase in criminal activity sees villains taking advantage of the opportunity, engaging in rampant robbery. Almost daily, several robbery cases occur. Yesterday, two cases of armed robbery by bandits occurred on both land and water. The land case took place in the Man Kam To area of the central border. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Travel Together, Encounter Robbers En Route</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, Zhang You, owner of the Wenji Silver Shop in Shenzhen, and his wife, Ms. Liang, were riding a motorcycle. Zhang was driving, with Ms. Liang on the back. Having completed their business in Hong Kong, they intended to return to Shenzhen. Unexpectedly, as they were driving through the Xinwuling Village area in Sheung Shui, New Territories, near the Man Kam To border, three burly men dressed in black suddenly rushed out from the shadows and blocked their path. Two of them brandished weapons, and one held a sharp blade, ordering them to stop. The three robbers then approached, first pressing Zhang to the ground and pointing a gun tightly at his chest. They then ransacked his pockets, stealing a total of one hundred Hong Kong dollars in five and ten-dollar bills. His wife's leather handbag, valued at four dollars, was also robbed at the same time.</p>
<p>Two Robbers Escape, One Suspected Beaten to Death</p>
<p>After succeeding in their robbery, the three villains first punctured the motorcycle tires with their blades and then abandoned the Zhang couple, fleeing forward. Unwilling to accept their losses, the Zhang couple shouted loudly for help and sounded the horn. Local villagers and police officers, hearing the alarm, rushed to their aid. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the three villains fled directly into Chinese territory. Two of the robbers managed to enter Chinese territory, but the local defense forces had already been alerted. They intercepted the robbers and successfully captured the two men. The remaining robber, unable to escape in time, was captured by the local villagers and beaten severely, suspected of being beaten to death on the spot. Afterwards, the Zhang couple returned to the police station with the officers to file a report.</p>
<p>Cargo Boat Robbed by Thieves in Waters off Tung Ku</p>
<p>Also, water transport worker Liang Wu (age 27) went to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station yesterday morning to report a crime. According to him, he is from Dongguan County and makes a living transporting goods for others. The day before yesterday at 4 PM, he was carrying a large shipment of goods on an unmarked cargo boat back to Dongguan. Unexpectedly, around 9 PM that evening, when the boat reached the waters off Tung Ku, he suddenly saw two pirate boats approaching. Each boat had five pirates, a total of ten men, all armed with long guns. They jumped onto the cargo boat and robbed him of the goods he was carrying back to Dongguan. The shipment included 200 bags of raw silk, 70 cans of cooking oil, 80 bags of white sugar, and other goods, totaling 763 dollars in value. All the goods were transferred to the pirate boats, and the boat's skipper also fled with the pirates. Later, he and the remaining crew members managed to steer the boat back to Hong Kong, arriving yesterday morning to report the incident to the police.</p>
<h3>Cathay Theatre to Open Today</h3>

The opening of this theatre will undoubtedly add a vibrant spark to Hong Kong's entertainment scene.</p>
<h3>A Sharp Increase in Remittances from Overseas Chinese Returning to China During the Lunar New Year; Total Remittances Last Year Reached 60 Million Dollars; Remittances are Centered in Hong Kong and Transferred to Various Locations</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) A great number of our compatriots go abroad to make a living, especially those from Guangdong province. Guangdong is a coastal region, maintaining very close ties with the outside world. The people of Guangdong are known for their hard work and ability in business and labor. They can earn higher wages overseas, making a living easier than in the mainland. Through diligence and thrift, they save their surplus income and remit it back to their homeland to support their families, providing them with a comfortable living. Therefore, every year, the number of overseas Chinese remitting money back to China is extremely high. This remittance is a crucial financial resource for our nation. As the Lunar New Year approaches, remittances from overseas Chinese returning home to provide their families with spending money for the New Year holidays become particularly substantial. Currently, as the New Year celebrations draw near, remittances have seen a sharp increase. Yesterday, our reporter inquired with a financier about the recent situation of remittances from overseas Chinese returning home. According to the financier, in the past, remittances from overseas Chinese returning home amounted to approximately 30 to 40 million dollars annually. This remittance provides significant benefits to foreign exchange settlements. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese have been deeply patriotic, leading to even greater remittances back to China compared to the past. Part of the remittances is donated to the government or used to purchase public bonds. Another part is needed to support families displaced or in need of relief due to the impact of war in various parts of the country. Therefore, in the past year, remittances from overseas Chinese returning home have doubled compared to previous years, reaching a total of 60 million dollars. Among them, 11 million dollars were directly donated to the government. There were also significant donations to various charitable organizations for the purpose of relieving refugees and comforting wounded soldiers. Currently, our authorities are actively planning to develop the resources of the western regions, encouraging overseas Chinese to invest and manage businesses. Therefore, the amount of overseas Chinese remittances returning to China for the purpose of developing resources is also very substantial. All remittances from overseas Chinese around the world to their homeland must be transferred through Hong Kong. Therefore, foreign exchange transactions here are extremely active. Remittances destined for central and northern China are transferred through Shanghai, while those for northern Guangdong and Jiangxi-Fujian are transferred through Shantou. Remittances for Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces are transferred through Guangzhou Bay. (Jun)</p>

<h3>Another Group of Young People Return Home to Serve the Country</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Flag Presentation Ceremony for the Fourth Group of the Student Relief Association's Return-to-Service Corps</p>
<p>Hong Kong is enveloped in the atmosphere of "Chinese New Year." What occupies the minds of most people is how to find money to get through the New Year and how to fully enjoy eating, dressing, playing, etc. However, on the other hand, there is a group of passionate young people who are willing to leave this "comfortable nest" and go to the front lines of the motherland to serve. What occupies their minds is how to become close friends with soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>Not long ago, we sent off the Youth Association's Army Service Corps to return to serve the country. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association's fourth group of the Return-to-Service Corps held a flag presentation ceremony last night and is scheduled to depart tomorrow. Although the Student Relief Association and the Youth Association are formally two separate organizations, their work has the same goals, and their vibrant spirit is equally respectable and lovely.</p>
<p>Last night, with excitement, I arrived at the Student Relief Association's hall at seven o'clock to attend the flag presentation ceremony for the fourth group returning to serve the country.</p>
<p>A large portrait of the leader was placed in the center of the hall's front wall, and notices covered the surrounding walls. This fully expresses the beliefs and dynamic work of Hong Kong's leading student organization.</p>
<p>A female student I spoke with was unwilling to continue studying at a Hong Kong school. Without even telling her family, she was excited to return to her motherland to serve. Deeply moved, I was reminded of a large group of young people in Shanghai recently who left their schools and families without informing them and secretly ran to the front lines to develop their passion and vitality. There are quite a few similarities. This is a factual issue: In this great era, young people cannot be confined, and positive guidance is the only way.</p>
<p>According to the corps leader, Tan Jiefu, the Student Relief Association has sent three service corps back to the country, totaling about one hundred people, who are assigned to serve on various battlefields. They are all safe and their work is progressing smoothly. This fourth group has a total of thirty people, mostly students from Hong Kong schools and students and educated youths from Guangzhou who have come to Hong Kong. About one or two-tenths of them are women. To participate in the sacred national liberation struggle, they have sacrificed their comfortable lives and are willing to endure a difficult life where they only have six dollars a month, including food expenses. Although their material conditions are far inferior to those of the Youth Association's Army Service Corps, their spirit of courageous struggle is even more admirable. The progress of Hong Kong's young students truly demonstrates the rebirth of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The hall became crowded, and the opening ceremony began. After Chairman Li Zhiyao opened the meeting, the flag was presented, reports were given, speeches were made, and songs were sung, filling the atmosphere with tension and excitement.</p>
<p>Our respect for this corps is the same as for the Youth Association's Army Service Corps. Returning home to serve the country are outstanding young people who are the sons and daughters needed by the Chinese nation. If the passion and vitality of young people are fully developed, they will surely move the soldiers and the people. However, there are a few points that need attention: (1) Be realistic. Do not underestimate the objective environment, nor overestimate it. (2) Go deep into the lives of the grassroots, and overcome the tendency to use rhetorical language and live an aristocratic life. (3) Be strict about private life, and demonstrate a spirit of unity and discipline. (4) The problems faced by soldiers and civilians are all areas where we should help them solve them and serve them. Overcome the childish habit of only singing songs and performing plays. Finally, we sincerely wish our service friends to strengthen their self-education in practical life and grow up in hardship!</p>
<h3>Student Relief Association Launches "Lucky Money" Donation Campaign for Children; "Lucky Money" Donation Booths to be Set Up in Various Theaters</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Student Relief Association, in light of the upcoming Lunar New Year and the practice of giving "lucky money" (lai see), notes that the amount received by children each year is quite considerable. Therefore, it has launched a "Lucky Money" donation campaign, setting up "Lucky Money" donation booths in various theaters and major stores on the third, fourth, and fifth days of the Lunar New Year. Children from the association will encourage all children in Hong Kong to donate their "lucky money" to transform unnecessary waste into meaningful contributions. The donated funds will be used entirely to aid refugee children. The association will soon release various comic-style promotional materials to widely promote national salvation among children and achieve significant results. The association's financial credit record has now been printed and will be distributed to various schools and community organizations in the coming days.</p>
<h3>A Visitor from Guangzhou Talks About Guangzhou Four Months After the Fall; A Hundred Ugly Scenes of Gangs Fighting for Power and Profit; Soaring Prices, Rice at Four Catties Per Dollar</h3>
<p>Guangzhou has been occupied for four months now. Under the control of the [Japanese], citizens who could not evacuate have suffered greatly. The once prosperous and brilliant Guangzhou is now shrouded in a sad atmosphere. Reports about the tragic situation in the city after the looting have repeatedly appeared in the newspapers. Recently, a gentleman from Guangzhou detailed the current situation to a reporter. What follows is a record of his account for the benefit of overseas compatriots who care about their hometown.</p>
<p>The Puppet Maintenance Committee</p>
<p>According to the gentleman, after occupying Guangzhou, the Japanese established the so-called "Guangzhou City Security Maintenance Committee" under their control. They manipulated political power to implement their insidious policy of using Chinese to control Chinese. However, most people with a little sense of conscience were unwilling to serve as Japanese lackeys and be driven by the Japanese. Therefore, for a long time after the Japanese occupation of Guangzhou, a puppet maintenance committee could not be formed. Only last month did scoundrels like Han Jian Peng [name] and Xi [name] shamelessly assume office. The organization of the puppet maintenance committee is divided into the administrative department (headed by traitor Xi [name]), the public security department (headed by traitor Lu [name]), a puppet secretary-general (traitor Chen [name]), the finance department (traitor Liao [name]), the judicial department (traitor Zhuo [name]), the transportation department (traitor Liang [name]), the reconstruction department (traitor Shang [name]), and a puppet women's maintenance committee chaired by traitor Shi [name]. The whole group is a pack of rats and foxes, each trying to expand their power, curry favor with the Japanese, and engage in intense infighting. The Japanese behind the scenes manipulating these scoundrels are Colonel Miyazaki, head of the special service agency, Lieutenant Colonel Hayashi, commander of the military police, and Commander Ito of the naval special service department, each of whom also has his own sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Ugly Behavior of Various Traitors</p>
<p>In addition to establishing the departments mentioned above, the puppet maintenance committee recently established a puppet self-defense corps, headed by Wang [name], a former notorious gangster in Guangzhou. During the period of the Southwest Government, Wang committed murder and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. He had served seven and a half years until the Guangzhou Incident, when he was released. Wang has a concubine who is very beautiful. In order to connect with the head of the Japanese special service agency, Wang [did something] and obtained an official position. Wang also has a private secretary named Miss Cheng, who specializes in translation. Cheng is a former student who studied in Japan and is proficient in Japanese, so she is very much favored by Wang. On the 21st of last month, the Japanese searched Cheng's residence and found hundreds of stolen electric fans and many other items. Knowing that Cheng was involved in robbery, they executed her by firing squad. Wang was very dissatisfied as a result. Traitor Shang [name] was an unknown lawyer in Guangzhou. Recently, he opposed traitor Peng [name] in some matter and was executed by firing squad three weeks ago. Traitor Shi [name] was Peng [name]'s abandoned concubine ten years ago. She also obtained a position through [some means]. She maintains broad connections with the Japanese and has recently allied with traitor Chen to expand her influence. Therefore, she is also quite favored by the Japanese. Major hotels in the city have been confiscated and converted into Japanese offices. Baiyun, Xinya, Xinhua, Wanbin, Baigong, and Jinlong have resumed business under Japanese control.</p>
<p>Conditions in the City</p>
<p>Water pipes, electricity, and telephones have been restored, but only for Japanese offices. Homes and businesses in the city are refused service. Long-distance buses have also resumed, renamed Fuda Company, but there are only twelve buses. The Japanese military uses military currency worth one cent for bus tickets. Gambling dens and brothels are rampant in the city. There are over seven hundred gambling dens, over a thousand stalls set up on the streets, and over five hundred opium dens. Brothels are mostly located in the Education Road area. The mansion of the wealthy businessman [name] has also been converted into a brothel. Recently, the Japanese transported a thousand Japanese prostitutes. Luxurious homes belonging to wealthy Easterners have been occupied by high-ranking Japanese officials. Regarding waterways and transportation, three rural ferry routes have resumed operations under Japanese surveillance. Over a hundred Japanese warships and armed fishing boats are anchored on the Guangzhou River, mostly at docks along the Henan Inner Harbor. Newspapers in the city have been occupied by the Japanese and used as propaganda organs. The "Guangdong Express," published three times a week, is located at the former site of the "Star Cantonese Daily," and the "Guangzhou People's Voice," published daily, is located at the former site of the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Daily." The editorials are extremely absurd. Fires occur frequently in the city, averaging six per day. In addition, air raid sirens are frequently heard, no different from before Guangzhou fell. Our heroic air force occasionally appears over the suburbs and the city, and the Japanese deceptively call them "strange machines" to cover up the truth. However, their panic can be seen in their hasty preparations.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices</p>
<p>Currently, about 300,000 citizens remain in Guangzhou, most of whom are seeking opportunities to escape. Few return to the city. Among the residents remaining in the city, apart from a few law-abiding citizens who were unable to evacuate, most are local ruffians and peddlers. Prices are extremely high. One Japanese military yuan can buy only four catties of rice. Vegetables cost one yuan and three cents per catty, fish and meat cost one yuan and five cents per catty, and pork costs one yuan and five cents per catty. However, dog meat is extremely cheap. In order to eradicate guerrilla activity, the Japanese have announced that they will buy civilian firearms, offering a high price of forty yuan per gun. However, those who surrender their weapons and collect the money are never seen again.</p>

<h3>Reprinted: New Tricks with Old Conspiracies</h3>
<p>— Chen Shaoyu</p>
<p>Speech at the Anti-Japanese [Blank Space] Conference of People from All Walks of Life in Yan'an</p>
<p>(7) Wang Jingwei's [Blank Space] Behavior is Not Accidental</p>
<p>Comrades! Compatriots from All Walks of Life!</p>
<p>(8) The [Blank Space] Plenary Session of the Central Committee Pointed Out the Japanese [Blank Space] and Pro-Japanese Faction's Conspiracy</p>
<p>Everyone remembers:</p>
<p>Still hidden within the anti-Japanese camp, engaging in [Blank Space] activities with the [Blank Space].</p>
<p>(9) Characteristics of the Current Situation</p>
<p>The characteristic of the current political situation lies precisely in the fact that in the face of China's continued resistance against Japan and his own increasing difficulties, the Japanese are not only intensifying their military offensive against us, but also stepping up the use of [Blank Space] to implement their "using Chinese to control Chinese" policy.</p>
<p>(10) Incidental Question to Zhang Junli</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I would also like to incidentally question several members of the National Socialist Party. First, I want to ask Zhang Junli why, because his actions are too closely related to Wang Jingwei. At the First National Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Junli did not say a word on any issue, but he did speak to propose a resolution thanking the "highly respected" Chairman Wang. At the Second National Political Consultative Conference, he put forward a proposal that was actually opposed to Chairman Chiang, and at the same time, disregarding our opposition, he gave a report opposing Chairman Chiang at the conference with Wang Jingwei's support. Shortly before Wang Jingwei fled, he sent a so-called open letter to Mr. Mao Zedong, the content of which was nothing more than anti-communism, anti-Eighth Route Army, and anti-Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, which was no different from the anti-communist content mentioned by Wang Jingwei later (in the telegram of December 29 last year). At the same time, after Zhang Junli's letter was published, the Japanese immediately broadcast on wireless radio that Zhang Junli, a member of the Wang Jingwei faction, had published an open letter to Mao Zedong, implementing anti-communism, and greatly praised Mr. Zhang. All of this makes us have to doubt Zhang Junli's political stance. Some people say that Zhang Junli is in cahoots with Wang Jingwei; some people say that Zhang Junli is a university professor without political experience and has been exploited by Wang Jingwei. Why are so many of Zhang Junli's actions consistent with Wang Jingwei? We hope that Zhang Junli himself will answer to the people of the country in words and actions. In addition, at the Second National Political Consultative Conference, some political councilors who made peace speeches did not represent their determination to support Chairman Chiang and his October 30 declaration, and they happened to be members of the National Socialist Party. Therefore, many people now have doubts about the political stance of the National Socialist Party. We hope that the National Socialist Party will have a firm stance on fundamental national policies. We hope that the National Socialist Party and other leaders and members will rise up to correct Zhang Junli's remarks and actions that violate the national policy of resisting Japan. Speaking of this, I would like to once again advise those anti-communist elements who are not Wang's people subjectively today, but who are particularly creating friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and undermining the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party: Please make less temper, please have less prejudice, and please recognize that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are a determined anti-Japanese force and loyal friends of the anti-Japanese people. Your anti-communism now objectively helps the Japanese and Wang Jingwei; your anti-communism now actually opposes the resistance against Japan, opposes the Kuomintang that leads the resistance against Japan, and opposes the liberation of the Chinese nation. At the same time, we are willing to tell all Chinese compatriots that in our great era of resistance against Japan, the most correct, simple, and clear way to recognize the truth is that whatever the Japanese and Chinese traitors think is good must be bad for the Chinese people; conversely, whatever the Japanese and Chinese traitors think is bad must be good for the Chinese people. Based on this indelible truth, because the Japanese favor Wang Jingwei, we Chinese must oppose Wang Jingwei; the Japanese and Chinese traitors oppose Chairman Chiang, oppose the Kuomintang, and oppose the National Government, we Chinese must support Chairman Chiang, support the Kuomintang, and support the National Government; the Japanese traitors oppose the Communist Party, oppose the Eighth Route Army, oppose the New Fourth Army, and oppose the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, we Chinese people must support the [Blank Space], support the Eighth Route Army, support the New Fourth Army, and support the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The Japanese and Chinese traitors want to undermine Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, undermine national unity in order to undermine China's resistance against Japan and destroy China, we Chinese people must uphold Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, unite closely as a nation, persist in resisting Japan, and strive for China's independent survival. Do not say whatever the Japanese traitors like to say! Do not do whatever the Japanese traitors are happy about! This should be the minimum responsibility and the proper attitude of every true Chinese today. Wang Jingwei was threatened and enticed by the Japanese and fled from the rear of our country's resistance against Japan. Wang Jingwei took the statement of the enemy Prime Minister Konoe as a blueprint for his own telegram. Wang Jingwei is willing to implement the Japanese policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" and carry out the despicable actions of anti-Chiang, anti-communist, and anti-resistance. Therefore! ——Down with the Japanese fascist warlords! Down with the Japanese's new tools——</p>

<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>The American ship "Lianlu" is expected to arrive in Hong Kong from Little Luzon at noon today. It will then enter the Kowloon Dockyard for repairs. The ship was formerly the "Haining," belonging to the formerly known as Jebsen &amp; Co. It was purchased several years ago by the Yuanheng Manila Rope Company in Little Luzon to transport manila rope and travel among the Philippine islands. This time, the ship is coming to Hong Kong solely for repairs, so it is not carrying any cargo. The Prince Company is the agent for the ship in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The British Queen, belonging to Changxing Company, is the company's largest ship. The ship makes a round-the-world voyage every year. It is learned that the ship departed from the United States yesterday and has now arrived in Bombay. It is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at 7:00 AM on the eighth of next month.</p>
<p>The Marine Department issued a notice yesterday stating the office hours of various departments of the department during the Chinese New Year holidays. On the 19th (Sunday), the Shipping Department and the Sailing Vessel Department will be closed all day. On the 20th (Monday) and the 21st (Tuesday), the Shipping Department will be open from 10:00 AM to noon, and the Sailing Vessel Department will be open from 11:00 AM to noon.</p>
<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3>From Shantou to Saigon</h3>
<p>— Hua You</p>
<p>Landing on the Saigon Shore</p>
<p>On the 23rd, we prepared to disembark at 7:00 AM. Because there were too many people, we didn't want to be with the crowd, so we didn't leave the ship until 8:20 AM to go to the French colony. (Many doctors were waiting by the ship's ladder to check if the smallpox vaccinations on your arms had taken. If not, they would revaccinate you.) The dockworkers standing at the foot of the ship's ladder took my small leather suitcase. Readers, please note that the workers standing on the Saigon pier who take your luggage are not sending it to the hotel but are carrying it to the customs warehouse for inspection. We could only go empty-handed, being driven like pigs and ducks by Annamese police to the customs office for inspection. After the search, we were driven to the "New Guest Office" (commonly known as the "Piglet Jail") to give our fingerprints and complete the entry procedures. The local rulers cleverly exploit the different dialects of our various regions, creating five categories (Zhaoqing, Chaozhou, Jiaying, Hainan, Fujian) and then dividing these five categories into seven prefectures: Chaozhou, Jiaying, Yai, Gaozhou, Leizhou, Fujian (here, it seems to refer specifically to Xiamen). This naturally makes it easier for them to govern. Because of the language barrier between the general overseas Chinese, they often quarrel, and incidents such as fights and lawsuits are too numerous to count. Recently, our government established a consulate in Saigon. Because most overseas Chinese do not understand Mandarin and cannot directly exchange opinions with the consulate staff, they have gradually realized the need to learn Mandarin. On the one hand, the consulate is also working hard to promote the popularization of Mandarin. It is believed that in the near future, the overseas Chinese there will eliminate their divisions and unite.</p>
<p>The offices of each group all have a wooden plaque about a foot long and five inches wide hanging above the door, with a few red characters engraved on it. Each group employs a type of staff member to handle the entry papers for the people of that group. These staff members are generally referred to as "Machin." The monthly salary of a "Machin" ranges from six to twenty yuan. Although their monthly salary is so low, their clothing is very extravagant. It goes without saying that they wear Western suits and leather shoes and travel by car. They drink Malancherry wine and smoke "Gongban" opium (many people in Annam smoke opium). If you carefully calculate their daily expenses, it would cost no less than ten yuan. Where do they get so much money to spend? Speaking of this, we must describe their sources of income. According to the old manager of the Yong'an Hotel in Saigon: "These 'Machins' earn a lot of dirty money! If they relied on their monthly salary, it wouldn't even be enough for them to smoke cigarettes! If they didn't earn dirty money, where would they get so much good wine and opium!" When I asked him what kind of dirty money they were earning, he gave just one example, which was enough to make one exclaim in astonishment. He said that each time, more than a thousand overseas Chinese arrive in Saigon from Shantou! Among these thousand or so people, there are many who are over twenty years old but have young children, and they often want to lie about being a few years younger to be registered as children (the French government stipulates that people over eighteen must pay a poll tax). In this way, the so-called "Machins" will use their silver tongues to tell you that they can help you reduce your age by a few years (in fact, this is also their duty to do so), while asking you for a price, ranging from dozens of yuan per person. They rely on nothing more than a mouth and a pen that can write numbers. Although they fill in those numbers for people, they will not take that entry paper to the new customs officer (French) for signature. It still needs to be taken to the new customs officer for signature by the person themselves. If the new customs officer thinks that you are older than the number written, he can add a few years to it for you. According to this, the so-called "Machins" are not qualified to earn this money. It is a pity that most of these overseas Chinese have not received education. Once they arrive in a strange place, they do not understand the language or the rules, so they have no choice but to grit their teeth and let others extort them!</p>
<p>In addition to what has been said above, they have many other ways of making money! For example, they can add a privately stipulated tax to your import and export taxes. Just taking the export paper as an example, if you ask him to handle the export paper, he will add a few extra yuan to you as their handling fee. It is said that the chief responsible for handling import and export papers in the New Guest Office now has more than 200,000 yuan saved up. Undoubtedly, this rich man's wealth is built from the blood of our hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots. The French absolutely do not allow this kind of illegal income. As long as you produce evidence and report it, the colonial government cannot forgive them. Unfortunately, 90% of the general overseas Chinese have not received education, so they naturally do not know how to collect evidence, nor do they have the courage to report it. Because they know the weaknesses of the general overseas Chinese, they are unscrupulous and do whatever they want.</p>
<p>When handling entry procedures at the New Guest Office, if you can bribe, you can naturally clear the procedures early. If you arrive after their business hours, then you have to temporarily humble yourself and be locked up by them. If you arrive on a Saturday, then their business hours are only one morning. In one morning, they naturally cannot clear the entry papers for more than a thousand people. All those locked up in the "Piglet Jail" have no choice but to wait eagerly for Monday to arrive. This means serving a two-day prison sentence. This refers to those who have money to pay taxes. If you do not have money to pay taxes, you will be locked up in another kind of prison. When there is a ship leaving the country, you will be deported. Many people often suffer this hardship because they do not have enough money. The author once took advantage of the opportunity to inquire about criminals to visit the immigration office and see the prison specially set up to detain our overseas Chinese compatriots. I saw many overseas Chinese standing in the iron gates of the prison, emaciated like birds. At that time, I had the following two feelings: You were transported here by iron ships from your distant homeland. That fare was probably raised by selling your cattle and mortgaging your house. You all hoped that you could make a fortune and become rich as soon as you arrived here. Who would have thought that as soon as you landed on the Saigon shore, you would not have money to pay taxes and would end up in jail. Even if you are lucky enough to be deported and return to your hometown, your cattle and even your old house are already in the hands of others. What is the point of all this suffering?</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Interport Team's Second Practice Session Changed to Playing Against Hong Kong League Team Tomorrow Due to Military League Being Unable to Accept Invitation</h3>
<p>(Our Special Correspondent) The Hong Kong-Philippines interport football match is scheduled to be held this weekend. After the Hong Kong interport team was formed, it held its first practice match with the Hong Kong League team last Thursday. Because the team was newly assembled and lacked coordination, the performance was nothing spectacular. In order to improve the team's cooperation, the selection committee decided to hold a second practice match between the team and the Military League team at 5:00 PM tomorrow. According to sources from the General Association, the Military League is unable to accept the invitation and has notified the General Association. Therefore, the General Association has decided to send another Hong Kong League team (not the Hong Kong League team that will compete against the Philippines team on the 20th) to play against them. The lineup has been determined. Although the center forward Biruto is on the list, he has been slightly ill recently and it is not known whether he will be able to participate. The right winger Yang Shuiyi is definitely confirmed. As for the tickets, they are still 20 cents each. Tomorrow's Navy Stadium will be lively again. The lineups of the two teams are listed below:</p>

<h3>Charity Basketball Games Last Night: Eastern and Star Island Both Win</h3>
<p>The Basketball Association held a charity basketball game for the Youth Relief Fund last night at 7:00 PM at the YMCA. The gym, which had been quiet for a long time, was crowded with people again last night. This event was nothing less than a grand gathering of the Hong Kong basketball community. The Eastern women's team not only had all the top players from Zhi Xing, but also added Chen Rongtang from the Overseas Chinese team. The Meteor team brought together the best players from various teams, such as Ye Meilian, Sun Yuming from Mei Fang, Liu Shouguang, Xiao Huizhen from Overseas Chinese, and Li Chunyu from Guangda. The Star Island men's team was the incarnation of the former Group A champion YMCA team. The Eastern team assembled famous players from various places to form a team. Therefore, the excitement of the two games was admired by general fans.</p>
<p>38 to 34: Eastern Wins Against Meteor</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM, the first game was between the Eastern women's team and the Meteor team. After the start of the game, Liu Shouguang of the Meteor team scored a free throw, opening the record. Soon, Chen Rongtang and Li Baozhen of the Eastern team launched a large-scale attack. The Meteor defense was breached, and they lost several points in a row. Meilian, Shouguang, and Chunyu were not used to playing together, resulting in no room for them to use their skills. Although Chunyu and Shouguang later scored one shot and one free throw, they ultimately lost the first quarter 4 to 9. After the restart, Meilian suddenly emerged, shooting a reverse layup from under the basket. The beauty of her posture made the audience cheer. Her long-range shooting skills were also accurate. In the second quarter, the Meteor team won 6 to 2. After changing sides again, Rongtang's killing nature was revived, and with Li Baozhen's assistance in the center, they formed a sweeping momentum and captured several points in a row. They regained the lead 13 to 9. In the third quarter and the final quarter, both sides fought hard. Their scores were only two points apart. The Meteor team relied on luck to score a point. The Eastern team retaliated. Shouguang scored two more points, and Baozhen also returned the favor with a shot. The intensity of the battle was unparalleled for a time. When the silver bell rang, the Eastern team finally won 38 to 34.</p>
<p>55 to 35: Star Island Wins Against Eastern</p>
<p>After the first game ended, the Star Island vs. Eastern men's team game began. Jie Fucheng of Star Island took the lead and opened the record. Zhi Nianhua of the Eastern team also retaliated. After a long battle, Star Island gradually became active. Li Peiyan and Liang Guoduo successively made shots, gaining a lot of points. Feng Nianhua and Luo Ji'an tried their best to counterattack, but because they were not familiar with the venue, the Eastern team finished the first half 14 to 20. After the break, the Eastern team tried their best to counterattack, and the situation was extremely intense. However, the Star Island defense was strong, and they could not shoot. Star Island later also pressed against the Eastern team. Zheng Zhenxuan and other strong players successively made shots. As a result, Star Island won 55 to 25. Also, the basketball lottery was won by Chen Yankai with number 805.</p>

<h3>Kwong Wah Football Team's New Year Tour to Macau</h3>
<p>The Kwong Wah Sports Association football team, after winning the Group B Special Silver Shield last year, was promoted to Group A this year. Although they have not had good results in the past league games, their morale has greatly improved in recent weeks. The players have shown their skills and drew 3-3 with the strong Medhurst team and defeated St. Joseph's, who had star players returning to help, 2-1, leaving a deep impression on people. If they continue to work hard, their future is promising. The players of this team are all rising stars. The reason why they did not have good performances in the past was mostly due to the wrong use of tactics and the lack of practice due to time constraints. Now, for the sake of training, they are taking advantage of the Lunar New Year holiday to go to Macau as a team to compete with the local strong teams in order to learn from each other's skills. They will depart on the first day of the New Year and return to Hong Kong late the next night. In addition to the top players from the Group A and B teams, they have also invited the former Police forward Morse to join them. The fans all know Morse's superb skills, so there is no need to elaborate. It is expected that he will make good contributions after arriving in Macau and give the Macau fans a feast for the eyes. There are also many good table tennis players in the team, and they may compete in several games with the Macau table tennis team at that time. The strongest lineup that the association plans to use during the Macau tour is as follows:</p>
<p>Li Guoqi</p>
<p>Zhong Huilin Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Yang Benhan Yang Zixiang Huang Huaji</p>
<p>Huang Jingcong Zou Wenzhi Morse Zhuo Shijin Liang Bingjin</p>
<h3>Kam Chuen Cup Table Tennis Tournament to be Held Soon</h3>
<p>The Kam Chuen Cup Table Tennis Tournament, organized by the Kam Chuen Tai Chi Society, has received a total of 36 participating teams since the registration deadline a few days ago. It was originally scheduled to start on the 10th of this month. Although the competition venue in Hong Kong has been determined, the Kowloon venue has not been resolved. Recently, after the person in charge of the association consulted with various parties, it has been completed. In the future, the Kowloon venue has been decided to use the Kam Chuen Society branch, Wai Yin Youth Association, Hongying and other table tennis rooms. As for the competition date, because the schedule has not yet been printed and the Lunar New Year holiday is approaching, the start date will be held after the Lunar New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>Canada Seeks to Host the 1944 World Games; the United States Actively Prepares for the Next Session</h3>
<p>[New York News] The United States Olympic Committee recently held a meeting here to discuss the planning and accommodation issues for participating in the 1940 World Games in Finland. The Finnish Consul General in New York, Gusanmo, will present the official invitation from Finland at the meeting, and Dr. Knight will represent Sweden to invite for the Winter World Games. Before this meeting was held, the Olympic boxing, fencing, gymnastics, swimming and other committees all had regular meetings. Also, according to Ottawa News, the Canadian Olympic Committee decided that Canada will decide to compete for the right to host the 1944 World Games.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Cup Volleyball Tournament Date Remains as Originally Scheduled</h3>
<p>The Disaster Relief Volleyball Charity Tournament, organized by the Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Sports Association, has been enthusiastically participated by various teams who are speaking out for the refugees. A total of six teams have joined, including Pui Ching, Pui Ying, South China University, St. Paul's, Ying Wa, and South China. A series of representative meetings have been held by the association to determine the competition date. Yesterday, the association, with the competition date approaching, held another representative meeting at Bu Zha at 5:00 PM, attended by Zheng Dianxian, Li Zhiming, Lu Guanyi, Shi Dongrong, Yang Tongzhu, He Gongke, Yu Yongcan, Hu Yaodong, and Zhang Jueke. The chairman was Li Zhiming. Regarding the problem of the venue, because the construction of the shed may not be completed in time, it was decided to proceed quickly. The location is still set at St. Paul's Stadium. As for the competition date, the parties still did not agree to the change, and finally decided to hold it on the original date of the 18th of this month. After the participants approved, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Film and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment... The Afflicted Cupid</p>
<p>Love Is A Headache</p>
<p>This is the beginning of Hollywood romantic comedies. The story lacks interest, the actors lack polished performances, and the development of each plot appears forced and unnatural.</p>
<p>The film depicts a Broadway star who, for publicity, reluctantly adopts two naughty children. Although the two children cause her much trouble, they awaken a maternal instinct in the pampered actress. It also portrays the jokes arising between the actress and a newspaper editor who is deeply in love with her but vehemently opposes her publicity methods.</p>
<p>Frank Albertson and Gladys George work hard, but fail to achieve remarkable results. Mickey Rooney's performance is not as brilliant as in "Judge Hardy's Family," but is still passable.</p>
<p>Queen... The Beloved Memory of a Good Doctor</p>
<p>A Man To Remember</p>
<p>For audiences who enjoy films with beautiful stories, this is the most ideal work. The film portrays the triumphs and failures of a country doctor's life, using flashbacks to develop each scene, narrating how the doctor served the community and the poor masses with a spirit of sacrifice for twenty years. At the same time, the film unreservedly exposes the selfish and self-serving ugly behavior of petty people in society.</p>
<p>Edward Ellis plays a doctor without a degree but with great ability and talent, harboring a desire to serve the people. He returns to his hometown with his young son, but only poor farmers dare to trust him. His rewards are merely agricultural products. On one occasion, the reward for a house call is the baby girl he delivered for a family. He perseveres without discouragement, raising his son to achieve high academic honors. However, he is disappointed that his son only pursues fame and money. Fortunately, he has an adopted daughter who provides help and comfort. Eventually, his foresight saves all the village children from a dangerous infectious disease, earning him the village's sincere respect and love.</p>
<p>Ann Sothern, who plays the adopted daughter, also gives an excellent performance.</p>
<p>Also screening is the latest "March of Time," which provides a detailed account and insightful analysis of the internal and external causes of Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Peace... Bravely Saving the Situation</p>
<p>The Storm</p>
<p>Describing the dissolute and unruly lives of some sailors, the director handles several tense scenes and climaxes quite movingly. Lu Shi-huo plays a ship's radio operator who is always causing trouble, and how he fights bravely for his younger brother. In the end, amidst storms and waves, he helps his brother's wife save his brother's life. The film vividly depicts the lives of people on board, how they play the field, and how they earnestly perform their duties. The actors portray a kind of irritable and barbaric character, with fights, troubles, drunkenness, flirting, and gambling all performed vividly and energetically.</p>
<p>Cathay... Triumphant</p>
<p>Battle of Broadway</p>
<p>This film depicts two tough guys representing a steel factory who go to New York for a meeting. At the same time, they are entrusted by the factory owner with the private mission of breaking up the love affair between the factory owner's son and a Broadway singer. Unexpectedly, the two men are also lustful and are crazily infatuated with another singer. Subsequently, the factory owner also follows suit, becoming jealous and ending up in a complete mess.</p>
<p>Although the film's story is nothing to write home about, the scenes are lively and interesting. The gags of "楚域多麥格連" and "白賴伶當利威's" fierce expressions and their mutually foolish performances, and the climax of the fight scene in the mental hospital, are among the most wonderful scenes in the film, both tense and lively, and full of comedic elements.</p>
<p>Orient... The Call of the Wild</p>

<h3>Welcoming Filipino Football Players (I)</h3>
<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>The intercity football players sent by the Philippines, bearing the mission of sports ambassadors, will arrive in our fragrant island tomorrow morning. In addition to competing for the intercity championship, their visit also carries the important task of connecting the sports circles of the two places and promoting friendship between the two sides as pioneers. Therefore, as they land, I dare to represent the football community of this island and all relevant parties with the utmost sincerity, to express our warmest welcome to our guests.</p>
<p>In the past, although the Philippine football team had a brief record with Fan Island, it is undoubtedly the first time they have come to compete in an intercity match. This will add a golden page to Hong Kong's never-ending football history. Their visit this time is to forge the first link in the unbreakable chain of friendship, linking the friendship between the football communities of the two places firmly and permanently. This great work and contribution deserves our utmost admiration and applause.</p>
<p>Although the Philippines and Hong Kong are only over six hundred miles apart by sea, news and developments in football there have always been somewhat isolated. In the first Far Eastern Games held in the Philippines in 1913, the Philippine football team defeated our makeshift team at the time. I am afraid that was the first time we knew of the prowess of Philippine football. In every subsequent Far Eastern Games, the football teams of China and the Philippines had fierce battles. Fortunately, we have always emerged victorious. I have had many indirect and direct contacts with the Philippine football team and have a deep connection with them. Taking advantage of their expedition to Hong Kong this time, I would like to present their "football history" to the best of my memory, to those compatriots who have not had much knowledge of Philippine football.</p>
<p>Before being under the protection of the United States, the Philippines was ruled by Spain. The spread of football there began with the influence of the Spanish eastward migration. Spanish football has a certain status in Europe, so in the Philippines, although it has not been fully promoted under the guidance of the United States in recent years, because of the original good teachers, a beautiful football foundation has long been laid, and it has always been able to maintain a considerable artistic standard. I remember the first time I came into contact with the Philippine football team was in the sixth Far Eastern Games in 1923. We won 3-0. The intensity of that match is still a bit terrifying to recall. The Filipinos kicked wildly, causing many disturbances, and scaring me, who was new to the big stage, to the point of shivering. Their individual skills were quite good, but they had not yet paid much attention to coordination. In 1925, at the seventh Far Eastern Games held in the Philippines, they were determined to avenge themselves by taking advantage of the home field advantage, but they were still defeated by us 5-1. In 1926, they formed a team to expedition to the Dutch East Indies to seek progress, but the results were mediocre. After returning home, they were accused by the All-Philippine Athletic Association of being paid for the trip because of travel expenses and subsidies, and their amateur qualifications were revoked for two weeks. In the eighth Far Eastern Games in 1927, they were forced to supplement with rising stars from the academic world, and their strength was greatly affected. In the match against our country, they lost 3-0 again. In 1928, I led the Lehua team from Shanghai to the Philippines. In six matches, we won four, drew one, and lost one. At that time, the Filipinos' interest in football was not as enthusiastic as their support for baseball and basketball. In the ninth Far Eastern Games in 1930, we still overcame them with a score of 3-1. In 1932, I again led the South China team on a tour of the Philippines, winning all six matches, and initiated night trials in the Philippines, which aroused a lot of interest among the public. In 1934, the tenth Far Eastern Games were held in the Philippines again. The government and society spared no effort in sponsoring, raising funds, and building a magnificent stadium. The Filipinos' enthusiasm for sports increased from this point on, and they vigorously promoted football. In that year's match between China and the Philippines, our team won 2-0 again. This was the last time I personally competed with the Filipinos. From the observations I have made in these eleven years (1923-1934), the most significant evolution in Philippine football has been the progress in cooperation. In the past, they relied solely on individual skills, but later they gradually understood the importance of teamwork and strived to follow modern scientific kicking methods. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>In Memory of My Late Friend Zhang Shu</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>Since the start of the sacred War of Resistance, countless sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, unwilling to be slaves, have lost their precious lives under the brutal force of ××'s invasion, under guns, cannons, and bombs!</p>
<p>Among these countless admirable victims, I knew quite a few. Just recently, there have been three or four; Pu Feng (note: Pu Feng recently sent a letter to a friend in Hong Kong, stating that he is still working on the front lines and has not encountered any difficulties) and Zhang Shu, both from the literary and artistic circles, are two of them.</p>
<p>Regarding Pu Feng and his heroic martyrdom, I recently published a short mourning article in the Chongqing Dagongbao, so I will not mention it again here.</p>
<p>Zhang Shu, as everyone knows, was an excellent composer and vocalist. He had been engaged in the study and production of songs for quite some time. He had a particular interest in folk songs, so the tunes he created were also very folk-like and easily accepted by the general public.</p>
<p>In recent years, he lived in his native Hunan for a considerable period of time to recuperate. Not long before the July 7th Incident, he returned to Shanghai. I remember the first night I met him at Xinghai's house, he showed me the "Coachman's Song" (I wrote the lyrics) that he had composed while recuperating in his hometown, and he even sang it to me in his loud voice. Later, at his residence and at several meetings of the "Songwriters Association" at Xinghai's house, we met several times. After the "July 7th Incident" and before the "August 13th Incident," we also collaborated on a song called "Defend North China" (this song was later renamed "Defend the Territory," but the content did not change much).</p>
<p>After the "August 13th Incident," he finally returned to Hunan and worked in Changsha. It seems that he had not been in Guilin for very long when, unfortunately, he was sacrificed in Guilin!</p>
<p>Zhang Shu's death is undoubtedly a great loss to the Chinese music community, just as Nie Er's death was a great loss to the Chinese music scene. For me personally, because we had a considerable friendship and were comrades-in-arms, I naturally cannot help but feel infinite grief!</p>
<p>However, the dead are gone, what more can be said? Now, our only hope is that more people will rise up, treading in his footsteps, to do the work that he did not finish and to fulfill his unfinished wishes!</p>
<h3>Refresh Your Own Views</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, the most common mistake people make is that they often lack new perspectives on new events, always looking at them with old, inherited methods. As a result, they not only fail to see the essence of the facts but also develop unnecessary pessimism.</p>
<p>The best example is the perspective on war.</p>
<p>Previously, the outcome of internal wars was determined by the gains and losses of strategic areas, important cities, and transportation hubs. As for the common people in the war zone, because both opposing sides were from the same country, they could ignore who won or lost and simply prepare to be obedient subjects. Therefore, the gains and losses of a city were considered the key to victory or defeat in the war. This view is purely an internal war perspective. Unfortunately, most people use this old perspective to judge new deployments and troop movements in military affairs.</p>
<p>As for the outcome of the War of Resistance, in addition to the gains and losses of territory, the more important factor is whether or not the hearts of the people are won over. If the people have self-respect and are unwilling to be slaves, they will all automatically arm themselves to defend their homeland and protect their families. Therefore, although the main force of the national defense army may temporarily change its deployment due to strategic considerations, guerrilla warfare will still rise like a storm, striking the × army everywhere, so that the important cities occupied by the × army are only points, and the railways and rivers occupied are only lines. From this point of view, the gains and losses of a city cannot be used to determine victory or defeat during the War of Resistance. The actual situation of our resistance war in recent years has been exactly like this. In the future, we must judge each battle of the War of Resistance from the perspective of the war against foreign aggression, so as not to fall into error again and lead to unnecessary pessimism.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, it is absolutely necessary to change inherited views and refresh one's own perspectives!</p>
<h3>Collective Creation and Individuality</h3>
<p>— Zhu You</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, a correct explanation of the spirit of the times is a true mission of literature. For this reason, anti-Japanese literature, which takes "faithfully and accurately reflecting the phenomenon of the War of Resistance" as its most basic task, is a unique progressive product of this era. The method adopted by this product should undoubtedly be (not absolutely) collective creation. After reading Mr. Jie Ru's article "Anti-Japanese Literature and Collective Creation," I am very confident in the statement that "collective creation is a new path in the development of artistic practice for thousands of years of mankind." There is no doubt that human culture is developing in new directions, and the newer it is, the more progress it makes. What reason is there not to support collective creation?</p>
<p>However, when collective creation is put into practical use, whether the writer's individuality will conflict with collective creation becomes a problem. According to Mr. Jie Ru's opinion, the answer to the question of "whether the writer's individual talents and genius will be restricted after participating in collective creation" is "no." I dare not agree with this negation. I have discussed this a lot with Mr. Jie Ru in the supplement of the National Daily, and here I only raise the issue of collective creation and individuality for discussion with the intention of seeking correct theories. This is a discussion, not a war of words, and I dare not take on the charge of challenging.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Jie Ru's article, "The so-called collective creation is to organize a group of writers to jointly engage in creation under a major specific topic outline, or under a specific theme and subject matter, to collectively handle the expression of the theme, collectively engage in the collection of materials, and even the artistic generalization, structure, layout, development of themes, the personality, posture, words and deeds, and descriptive techniques of characters, the use of words and rhetoric, etc., are all discussed and decided by the collective, and then completed through the collective expression and modification process." According to this statement, it is clear that Mr. Jie Ru's opinion is that the structure of collective creation, layout, development of themes, the personality, posture, words and deeds, and descriptive techniques of characters, the use of words and rhetoric, etc., are all "decided" by the collective. Undoubtedly, this "decision" is "fixed." A fixed structure, a fixed layout, a fixed development of themes, a fixed ... everything, wouldn't this make a mechanical creation set, restricting the author's individuality, or even making it impossible to fluently use his own special techniques due to the obstruction of a "fixed decision"?</p>
<p>It is difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to develop individuality under a decided structure and layout, and at least there is a considerable obstacle to development of genius.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Mr. Jie Ru's article: "Collectivism is only to unify all individualities within a correct cognitive framework, to guide and influence individuality, so that it can transform itself in the process of practice." From this statement, although it can be stated categorically that "collectivism and individuality are not opposed," in terms of the writer's individuality and the development of genius, there is inevitably some influence. In other words, there is inevitably a considerable (even if very small) restriction, a "transformation."</p>
<p>For this reason, in my ignorance, I believe that collective creation has a considerable restriction on the development of the writer's special techniques and special talents. Therefore, with a desire to learn, after more than two months of fleeing, abandoning the life of licking a pen and spreading paper, I put forward this issue for discussion, hoping that writers and readers will jointly study a correct answer.</p>
<p>The night of February 28, late at night in Qingshan</p>
<h3>To Mother</h3>
<p>— Yue Ming</p>
<p>In the lonely nights, Mother, I think of you all the time.</p>
<p>When Father and Sister carried my suitcase and saw me off to the ship that day, you dragged your weak body and leaned on the threshold, looking at me and crying. You sobbed and said, "Ming'er—when will you come back again in the future? ... When will you come back to see your old parents? ..." At this time, your hissing cries became louder. I really couldn't bear to look at you, and I didn't know how to comfort you. I just turned my back and blurted out from my throat, "Mom, I'm leaving."</p>
<p>Recalling this time when I came back, I happily stepped on the stairs. Hai Zhen, whom I had been separated from since I was five years old, was singing at the door. When he saw me, he said innocently, "Brother is back." I really didn't expect that he had not forgotten his brother's face in his young heart. That day, you were sick in bed because you had been seasick from the journey from the countryside to Shanghai. Father was preparing medicine for you by the bed. When you turned around and saw your son standing there, whom you hadn't seen for four years, you sat up as if you couldn't believe your eyes and said, "Are you my Ming'er? Ah, have you not forgotten your old mother?" You completely forgot about your illness and were so happy that you almost fainted. Your always red and sick eyes were constantly shedding hot tears. I was like the ten-year-old me.</p>
<h3>Local Accents</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>——A Letter That Can Be Made Public——</p>
<p>Brother ××:</p>
<p>I am currently in an extremely agitated state. My hands tremble incessantly, and you can tell how excited we are from the crooked handwriting.</p>
<p>I have escaped another disaster! I was almost massacred by the × people. Didn't I tell you in my last letter that the × people come here to stand guard every time? And how the villagers and guerrillas made the × people's sentries disappear, I seem to have told you about that as well. What I want to tell you here is what has recently happened, the fact that I want to tell you about now.</p>
<p>Usually, the × people's sentries are never more than thirty, but yesterday morning, two or three hundred people suddenly came from the county. At that time, I expected the worst. Most of the villagers immediately took small paths to the villages by the lake, but there were also some brave ones who stayed in town (of course, the traitors also stayed in town). No, many were unable to escape, so they closed their doors and hid in the corners of their houses, and I was one of them.</p>
<p>Soon, traitors came to knock on doors, notifying each household to open up, preparing for the "Imperial Army" to inspect "good citizen certificates," but out of ten houses, not even half opened their doors. Everyone knew what these ×× would do when they came in.</p>
<p>Not long after, the sound of doors breaking was heard, the sound of gunfire was heard, and after waiting a while, I heard the cries of women and the tragic screams of men calling for help. I thought I couldn't stay at home. ×× was determined to vent their anger from the guerrillas, so I slipped to the back door. After listening for a while and hearing no one passing by, I slipped out. At first, I crawled to the barren reed field behind the house, and I sat there. I don't know how long I sat there. Although I tried my best to be vigilant, listening and watching all nearby sounds and figures, my mind was as disordered as that of someone suffering from insomnia.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was startled, and my eyes were filled with red light and black smoke. The east end of the town was on fire. I thought I couldn't stay in the reeds any longer. Sparks flying onto the dried reed leaves would immediately cause a fire and bury me in the flames. This time, I didn't even look around, and I stood up and left. Not ten yards away behind me, there were two or three ×× standing, immediately firing at me. I hurriedly lay down behind a pile of desolate graves. As soon as I lay down, I thought they would chase after me, so I immediately stood up and ran again. The gun fired again, but I finally left them far behind. I think this escape was entirely due to the many wild graves, mulberry trees, and barren reed fields that blocked their line of sight along the way. The road also had many twists and turns, making it extremely difficult for them to aim.</p>
<p>After the × people left as usual at five o'clock in the afternoon, the people in the town dared to return. Fortunately, only seven or eight houses were burned, because the threshing ground separated them and prevented the fire from spreading throughout the town.</p>
<p>According to neighbors who didn't escape this time but managed to hide very well, when the ×× came in, they first drove the men into one room, and if there were women, they drove them into another upper room. The first batch of × people "inspecting good citizen certificates" were probably the luckiest, taking away all the valuable gold, silver, and jewelry, so their temper was "better." The second batch, because they couldn't find anything to loot, picked out some things that were still valuable, trampled on the women, and destroyed everything they couldn't take away, so by the time the third batch came, there was nothing left to steal. Each of them simply became more terrifying than man-eating beasts. They killed! Set fires! Gang-raped!</p>
<p>The waiter at Xingji Teahouse died because of buttons, Old Zhou with the crooked mouth died because of matches, and a certain fishmonger died because of copper coins. You don't understand what I mean, do you? I haven't told you about the terror that the × people have recently spread about our guerrillas, have I? ×× are afraid of the guerrillas, so today they say this is a symbol of guerrilla spies, and tomorrow they say that is a symbol—in fact, if you have money in your pocket, let the ×× rob you, and leave silently, even the real guerrillas are not afraid, but where does so much money come from? The three of them simply died because they had no money for them to plunder, and it just happened that the first one only had three buttons, the second had three matches left in the box, and the third died because of exactly three copper coins. According to the news spread by the traitors, three is the symbol of the Three Principles of the People, so they are guerrillas. As a joke, I, as the third son, am still uneasy because of this.</p>
<p>Originally, the traitors were local emperors, but this time, with the killings and arson, the townspeople hated the traitors and the ××, so they don't dare to live in the town anymore. They always come and go with the × soldiers, and more and more people are communicating with the guerrillas and joining the guerrillas.</p>
<p>"Like hoping for clouds and rain in a great drought," you wouldn't understand the anxiety of waiting anxiously. The villagers are spreading the news of conquering Nanjing and the recent news of our army every day, especially when the devils reveal their fear and unease through the traitors, everyone can't help but laugh and constantly say to themselves: "The time has come!" Let's do it "with our tools!" But... how long do we have to wait?</p>
<p>Every time the guerrillas come, everyone hopes and prays that they will stay for a long time, but they always leave again in the middle of the night. This kind of disappointment is truly indescribable.</p>
<p>I don't know if this letter can be sent to you or not. Wishing you</p>
<p>Strength. Your brother XYZ embraces you tightly. Tears that I usually can't shed are now, I don't know why, rolling down like water from the eaves, wetting my clothes and staining the bedding. Looking at your wrinkled face and white hair, I can't believe we've only been apart for four years. My tears cannot stop even more. Mother! You seem ten years older.</p>
<p>The moon by the corner of the wall, perhaps the red roses haven't withered yet: I remember the few willow branches I planted myself, perhaps they are about to sprout tender leaves; my rural home, seeing me after a long separation, how happy they must be! I am filled with joy, wanting to return to my lovely and perfect home. But father stops me, knowing that the ancestral home doesn't allow me to return like this. The × people have broken into our home, arresting, massacring, robbing, raping everywhere, the houses have been burned, the monthly red roses and willows have been cut off, the rural home, like a bird that has lost its nest, flies east and scatters west. Alas! The lovely and beautiful home, now... has turned into ruins. Mother! How do you feel?</p>
<p>Mother! Since that time, it's been quite a while. During your New Year celebrations or in the long nights, you must be thinking of your son. Perhaps your fragile heart! Has caused you to shed tears several times. Hoping that your son will be able to return soon.</p>
<p>But Mother! Our own home has been invaded by a pack of rabid wild dogs, and everything has been destroyed. Isn't this enough of an opportunity for us to take revenge? Mother! Don't expect it, wipe away your tears, you should say passionately: "Child, drive the × people out before you come back!"</p>
<p>Mother! Your son will be back soon, returning to our lovely home and seeing Mother again.</p>
