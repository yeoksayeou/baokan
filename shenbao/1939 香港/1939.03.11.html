<p>社評</p>
<h3>關於西班牙</h3>
<p>西班牙局勢急轉直下，盛傳「西班牙共和政府國防會態度不明，國防會與佛朗哥政府間之停戰談判似已開始進行」，這種消息，雖被各報用特號大字標題，排列於最顯著的地位，但是對於時局稍有研究與稍有識見的，却不會因此引起任何過分的驚異。因爲自從英法兩國統治者繼續對德意兩大侵略者妥協退讓，實行承認西班牙叛軍法期哥政府以後，事實上已經明白暴露，兩國統治者用最大壓力施諸曾經自己正式承認的西班牙共和政府，使其喪失任何反抗力量與繼續進行全面抗戰的力量，企圖由此達到他們所代表的少數金融資本領袖幻想中的『「和平」「發展」西班牙』。因此我們今日的問題，特別是正在繼續英勇抵抗日本侵略者的中國人民對於西班牙情形所有的問題是：西班牙人民反法西斯反侵略的英勇鬥爭果將就此全部失敗了嗎？西班牙事勢演變結果，對於歐洲以至世界將有什麼影響？西班牙問題對於世界和中國爭求和平與自由的人士，提出了怎樣重要的經騐與教訓？</p>
<p>首先，我們知道西班牙的「內戰」，是全西班牙求和平求自由的人民大眾，在人民陣線的共和政府的統一領導之下，反抗爲德意侵略者指揮與接濟而進攻祖國蹂躪同胞的法朗哥叛軍的戰爭。這種戰爭雖因德意法西斯侵略者的瘋狂猛攻，與英法統治者之一意壓迫，而慘遭重大的失敗，甚至有所謂「和平」談判的「進展」以至「成功」，但是在德意法西斯侵略者所操縱的佛朗哥統治之下，在英法兩國統治者徹底的妥協政策實施之，「和平」的「成功」不僅不是西班牙人民所企求的眞正和平與民主自由的成功，而且將是內部專制壓迫外國分割刦奪的加重，因此，西班牙的戰爭勢必在另一種形式下更趨劇烈。</p>
<p>其次，我們知道，不管國外壓力與國內叛徒勾結進迫，西班牙全體要求眞正和平與民主自由的人民大眾，尤其是具有三十餘月英勇鬥爭的經驗與教訓的人民大眾，必將繼續推進更英勇更堅决更有力的鬥爭。這種鬥爭必將在各地普遍發展，他們將予佛朗哥反動政權和國外任何侵畧的勢力的「開發」工作以最嚴厲的打擊，他們更將認眞切實地推進人民陣綫和反法西斯反侵略的統一戰綫，他們將在各淪陷地區建立起領導他們爭取眞正和平與自由的人民大眾自己的政權。西班牙經過三十餘月的戰鬥，全國國民經濟農工生產狀况已有極大變化，正確熱誠英勇地領導革命的政黨和人民陣綫，都已在戰爭中學習到更豐富可恃的勝利的戰略戰術，而且其影響其勢力亦正在開始發展。何况今日共和政府統治下，仍有全國四分之一的中部區域，它還有重要省會九處，它還有五十餘萬英勇精銳的軍隊，在瑪德里，華倫西亞等市，還有兵工廠足以自給。因此我們仍可斷言，西班牙戰爭沒有停止，更大的鬥爭還在後頭！</p>
<p>第三，調停西班牙戰爭的活動，雖已達到「成功」階段，所謂「和平」會議，縱使在外力壓迫下有所進展，然而所有這些都不能打擊意德兩法西斯侵略者在西班牙在歐洲進一步的胃險的野心，英法更决不能從西班牙的讓步而取得歐洲暫時的平靜。事實上，佛朗哥統治西班牙一旦實現，則法西斯國家在西歐卽可獲得極大優勢，法國旣巳陷於三面包圍，英國海上大動脈所受威脅亦正在日趨嚴重，現在標榜反共的法西斯國家已在開始其改變世界地圖的步驟了。大西洋面及直布羅陀的英國道路旣受控制，北菲英法殖民地亦繼被列入第一步侵奪計劃之內，此外德國現正積極準備向，東南歐進行侵畧，日本則業已乘機加强其對華南的控制及實行佔奪海南島，威脅英法在遠東的一切殖民地，「退讓賄賂决不會換取和平」，至此又獲新鮮的例證</p>
<p>第四，西班牙局勢的激變，當然已經而是正將教訓西班牙和英法等國的人民大眾，他們反法西斯侵略妥協的鬥爭，將在革命政黨正確統一領導之下積極開展。同時西班牙血淚事實更教訓了每一個中國求解放的戰士，要對內部一切搖動，妥協，和平，投降的傾向，鼓勵高度的警備，要對國際一切同情援助，在我們自力更生原則上更擴大的爭取，尤其是對於我國與和平柱石之蘇聯的聯系，要以最大的力量去鞏固發展和保衞它。乂人漢奸企圖利用西班牙局勢而以「英法蘇聯均不足持」「中國反共和親日始是正路」等邪說來破壞我國抗戰事業者，我們更當以「團結內部，堅持抗戰，」的事實，去打破這種新的陰謀。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從三月四日至十日</p>
<p>三月是躍動的季節，三月第一週巳在躍動中過去。在這異常動亂的世界，我們看淸楚兩大洪潮的衝突。一方面是法西斯侵略陣線，以日本及德意爲首，在若千資本主義國家統治者的妥協退讓政策下面更加瘋狂地在燃放戰火，日本向中國和南海，德國向東南歐，意大利向北菲，都已採取更猖狂的攻勢。另一方面是民主和平陣線，雖然其中有少數國家的統治者繼續對侵略者妥協退讓，但是廣大民眾正在爲民主和平陣線的鞏固與發展而奮鬥，在英國的進展　可驚人。而蘇聯則方在暴行聯共十八屆大會，一種更不可抗拒的反法西斯反侵略的力量，就將在全世界發展。用更大的努力來發展這個力量，是今日一切被壓迫大眾與和平正義人士的共同任務。</p>
<p>抗日戰爭一週間</p>
<p>中華民族爭求獨立自由反抗法西斯侵略的抗日戰爭，已經足足堅持了二十個月。最近四個月的局勢，顯得相當穩定，成爲抗戰由×優我劣的階段轉入×我相持的第二階段的特點。不過我們軍事上的進步還沒有到必要程度，削弱與打擊×人戰鬥力亦沒有到致命的程度，×我優劣形勢的轉變，亦只在開始，所以×人還保有繼續進攻的力量　，同時因爲戰線愈延長，戰區愈擴大，所以×人雖有繼續進攻力量，而其兵力不足與分散，又是極大的阻力。我們就要針對這種×情，增加它的困難，削弱它的力量。這一週間，×人固然爲振奮其疲敝的軍心與加强其佔領區的統治，並企圖冒險續進，故在各綫正面採積極的攻勢，尤其是在鄂省中部，分沿京（山）鐘（祥）路及漢（口）宜（昌）路大舉西犯，同時瘋狂轟炸宜昌襄陽樊城。因我正面陣綫鞏固，並且迅取對×軍側翼及後方的反攻，使×不得越過漢水襄河，至三月十日，鄂中局勢復趨穩定。華南局勢，×雖繼續增援，企圖由北海犯南路窺桂滇，但以我應付得宜，使×毫無進展。</p>
<p>北線我軍大勝利</p>
<p>華北方面，因我各軍各黨與民眾正確執行統一戰綫抗日綱領，到處發動×側×後的反攻，牽制及削弱×軍，鼓動×軍偽軍的譁變來降，察冀晉魯蘇各省抗戰大局益見勝利。據我軍當局報告，二月下半月我軍在各地積極活動，作戰四〇四次，獲步槍二千餘支，斃×達二萬一千三百八十五名。山西作戰二〇三次，斃×七二三名，俘×官兵五六四名，河南作戰四六次，斃×二〇二〇名，俘×兵五名，冀察　蘇魯作戰七五次，斃×三四九〇名，俘×官兵一〇九名。湘贛鄂作戰五六次，斃×一八七五名，俘×官兵二八名。又據美聯社二日重慶電稱去年十二月及今年正月，兩個月內，第八路軍與日偽軍作戰二五六次，斃日偽軍一萬名，生擒偽軍一六〇〇。計十二月份激戰一〇九次，斃日偽軍三七四三名。生擒日軍五五五名，偽軍八八二名，獲馬一二三四匹，步槍一七四三支，八路軍死傷總數一五五四名，損失步槍四〇枝。一月份激戰一五四次，斃日偽軍七〇一〇名，生擒日軍三一名，偽軍一五七名，獲步槍九五七技，偽軍投降八路軍者二七一三名，八路軍死傷四一七　名，其中一五〇三名中毒而死，損失步槍三八技。×軍現正準備以十八個師團在華北着手「掃蕩」，計在蘇北五師團，平漢路區三個半師團，道清路一個半師團，晉省六個半師團，綏陜一個半師團。晉×且已發動三路進犯　樂。這是我們不能忽視的。</p>
<p>婦女解放新階段</p>
<p>三月八日，國際婦女節日，全國婦女舉行熱烈記念。當前我國婦女自求解放，必須首先然烈支持與參加抗戰建國鬥爭，求得民族的解放；中華民族解放，亦必須獲得全國二萬萬以上的婦女參加，始能獲最後成功。而且中國已是世界的中國，中國婦女解放及民族解放，同時又與全世界民埃與被壓迫大眾的解放有密切關聯，因此我們還要鞏固與發展世界婦女反法西斯反侵略的統一戰綫，來爭取最後的勝利。婦女領袖宋慶齡宋美齡何香凝諸先生，對於婦運新階段的新任務，都有透麗的文章或演詞發表。香港女界紀念三八，情况尤爲熱烈，尤其是一致通過組織婦女救國聯合曾，建立婦女解放運動的統一戰綫，努力抗戰及救濟難民工作，這是多麼使人興奮的事！同日蘇聯眞理報習文盛　我國婦女說：『自日本侵略開始以來，中國婦女爲祖　自由奮鬥，最爲活動。前方後方，皆可看到中國婦女與其兄第丈夫共同保衞祖國，抵抗日×，中國婦女英勇行爲，在中國民族解放戰爭史上，建一光榮之貢。」希望每一個女同胞都以更英勇的奮鬥來報答國際友人的期望，而且要在鬥爭中特別準備到：克服未來環境的更加險惡，與加緊自我教育工作，培養新工作幹部。</p>
<p>全國教育會閉幕</p>
<p>全國教育會議於三月一日開幕，舉行全體大會十次，於九日圓滿結束。大會討論議案達三百餘件，並有會外建議百餘件。這次會議的成就，第一是大會通過臨時動議案，以蔣委員長三月四日在本會議訓詞爲今後我們教育的最高指導原則。蔣委員長訓詞，係在說明實行抗戰建國的教育政策，使全國的教育以革命的三民主義爲最高準則，使教育爲團結全國持久抗戰而服務。這正是各方面久所期望的，今後全國教育界必當特別努力遵行。第二，這次會議討論各案及宣言，亦充分表現教育將爲抗戰建國而服務，如在小學教育方面，注重實施勞動學科；師範教育方面，注重學生實習，高等教育方面實行體彎，及軍訓方面計劃力求普遍，都是今後教育重大改進之處。特別值得稱許的是宣言中明白指出：『我們擬充實社會教育的設施，對於成年補習教育與電化教育等項加以設計。我們要提高和健全華僑的教育，我們要關懷×人侵佔區域和×人後方，我們戰區以內的靑年，和一般想受國家教育的同胞，我們訂有方案，一定能積極推行。』是的，要一定能積極推行！尤其是義務教育的普及和大批抗日幹部的培養。</p>
<p>中英新借欵成立</p>
<p>英國對我新貸欵五百萬鎊，已於三月八日由英財相西門在下議院宜佈。我們應該認識第一，英國爲什麼能够貸欵與我？原因是（一）日本宣佈於三月十日起統制華北外匯，禁用法幣，使英國在華投資市場大受損害，而且日本侵略勢力日益發展，英國在華及全部遠東利益遭受威脅：故用對華貸款作爲經濟報復的第一步；（二）中國政府軍隊與民眾英勇抗戰二十個月，全國團結，政治進步，前途希望無限。使英國認識只有積極援華始能維護其權益；（三）全英民眾尤其是遠東工商投資關係人，鑒於英政府對於西班牙退議的非計，一致反對，爲防此種行動出現於遠東，各地反法西斯反侵略及援華制日運動乃如狂濤怒屬，迫使英政府採取積極步驟。第二，新貸欵成立後有什麼影響？有的：（　」）我國幣制將更穩定，抗戰前途更有希望；（二）英國金融工商事業，將獲相當重大的助益；（三）日本在遠東新冒險計劃受第一次重大打擊；（四）蘇聯援華獲得更大的便利；（五）美法各國援華運動可能更加積極。不過我們仍須注意：（一）五百萬貨款有如杯水車薪，我們要進一步發動英國更大的援助及民主和平各國的一致行動；（二）×人分化挑撥，以及造謠英國將强迫進行調解中日戰，等陰謀，必將隨之發展，急須加以打擊；（三）我們只有在自力更生原則下力爭外援，而非依賴外援，自力更生首在全國生動力量的馳動員，而爭取更大外援又首在全國團結長期抗戰的堅持！</p>
<p>反戰怒潮遍日本</p>
<p>和我國的內政進步外援眾多相反，日本則日益陷於外交孤立和內部變亂。尤其是戰爭長期化的影響，國內財政經濟危象大露，人民生活益趨絕境，因此國內及在華軍隊裏的反戰怒潮，益呈奔騰澎湃之勢。據重慶二日電（中央社，以下同），『×國反戰思想遍及全國，上月十七日關東南部町與大坪因征兵激烈發生暴動，鄉民聚眾到處放火，計焚燬三百餘戶，經大批軍警彈壓始告平息。』又軍慶三日電『東京外訊：日本反戰組織擴大，軍警機關竭力搜索，其秘密活動反更積極，本月一日，大阪火藥庫突然爆炸，當時延燒猛烈，附近營房住屋大半焚燬，死傷及被難人數約在二萬以上，前往戒備施救軍警竟逾萬名，現經東京警視所派大批人員偵查，始知係反戰團份子縱火所致，』又重慶七日電：『滬訊，×軍部以來華×軍內部糾紛迭起，及屢次發生反戰，近派大批人員分赴各地監查，華南×軍監查官尻木及荘田於前日抵滬，據云自大亞灣登陸後，至十二月底，華南×軍糾紛與反戰事件，共計廿七次。』又九日津訊，上月底津憲兵公開散發反侵略言論，已有六名於本月一日遭槍决。統計日本侵華所用兵力已佔全國兵力百分之八十五以上，死傷己達七十萬，所用戰費每日約一千萬日元，廿個月戰費約等於日本全部財產，現在國內生產降落，國外貿易縮小，軍費日益增重，反戰怒潮擴大，自非奇事。</p>
<p>和平陰謀的揭露</p>
<p>「和平」與「調解中日戰爭」的聲浪，這幾天似乎竟又『囂然塵上』顯然又是×人和漢奸在搗鬼。其實，我們並不反對和平，不，我們全　中國人民都竭誠希求和平之實現與中日親善共存共榮的，然而九一八以來日×對我全民族的進攻，暴露其滅亡我民族與征服太平洋的全部預定計劃，我們領袖蔣委員長鑒於妥協退讓忍受已到最後關頭，才領導全國抗戰。因爲只有抗戰，才能爭取和平。不過抗戰發動以後，倘使日×未受致命打擊，未放棄侵略政策撤退全部軍隊，則任何半途妥協，卽是我全民族的降服。但是現在言和者，有什麼根據呢？先看日本吧！三月八日眾院質問關於中國駐兵問題，堤康次郎問：『駐兵範圍是否長期及相當廣泛？』陸相坂垣答「當然長期如屢次所言，地城問題須視該時情形而定。」坂垣又稱：「佔領區內維持治安爲第一要義，但日本兵力有限，處處配足日本兵，事屬至難，故早已攷慮利用中國兵助其壓迫」又稱『就地籌餉，以中國人吸取中國物資，以中國物資供養日系軍隊』，然而親日漢奸却謂『日本已準備撤兵與我議和』！而且實際上日本正在加緊進攻西南的軍事行動、正在發動三路進攻西北，正在進攻鄂西狂炸襄樊宜昌，大規模進攻方在發動，『和平」在那裏？第二看我國，英勇血戰二十個月，犧牲當然不能白白犧牲，抗戰中的偉大成就又豈能自暴自棄？現在除了少數民族叛徒雖被放逐而仍主和親日以外，自最高領袖，軍政長官，各軍隊，各黨派，各民埃、各界同胞，實際上絕無甘心奴隸自居而主和降日的了。第三，國際上蘇聯固然已經而且正在予我以精神上軍事上偉大的援助，英國並且一再大量貸欵於我，美法各國亦莫不皆然、可見國際亦已深知中國抗戰不僅爲自求解放，亦爲維持世界和平，各國要保全遠東權益與世界和平，亦惟有支持中國抗戰到底。由此可知日×在此×我優劣形勢激劇轉變之際，宣傳『和乎』，實謀鬆懈我抗戰，掩蔽其新的進攻，便利其迅速降服我國！而親日漢妤乃竟爲×作倀，大倡『主動言和』『反共親日救國』，並且斷章取義地摘引少數政要與報紙的言論，大　造謠，企圖破壞我抗日統一戰綫，破壞我政府在人民中及國際間的威信，以帮助日×的新進攻，我們要加意警防！</p>
<p>西班牙戰爭前途</p>
<p>英法政府承認西班牙叛軍佛朗哥政府以後，四班牙民主共和國的軍隊及其人民，遭受到更大的壓迫與困難，這是我們所不能漠視的。然而最近來英法通訊社根據西叛軍發出的電訊，輒謂『西共和軍準備投降』，『和平談判已在進行』云云，認爲西班牙戰局已將結束。可是事實上，（一）共和政府領導下的西班牙人民的抗戰，在反抗由外國侵略者指揮下的法西斯叛軍，而求取全民族人民大眾的自由，今日叛軍縱佔優勢，人民禾獲自由，則抗戰决不中止：（二）共和軍雖極困難，但仍具備抗戰基礎。主要的是擁有全國四分之一的中部區域，九百餘萬忠誠的人民，五十　萬精銳的軍隊，革命政黨及經三十餘月鬥爭經騐的人民陣綫的領導；（三）國際同情援助繼續熱烈，尤其是蘇聯，過去，現在，將來，均將繼續克服更大的困難予西班牙人民以種種援助。我們應該明白西班牙全體人民今日的鬥爭一面，對內反動派鬥爭，保衞民主自由，爭取社會解放，一面對外抵抗德意侵略者，爭取民族解放，保衛歐洲和世界和平，我們不僅不能漠視其協助我國抗戰的意義。而且必須予以精神上物質上的支持！</p>

<p>蘇維挨社會主義共和國聯邦共產黨的第十八屆代表大會，巳於三月十日在莫斯科開幕，當此全世界被陷於由法西斯發動擴大的重分世界的大戰毒焰之下，民主和平各國惶駭震盪不可終日之際，這個被視爲『世界和平主要柱石』的國家內唯一領導的黨的全體大會，自然容易特別引起各方面的注意。海通社九日莫斯科電甚至還傳出消息，說『聯共執委會定本月十五日召開一特別會議，　屆時將討論一般世界政治問題，特別是注重於歐洲現狀，眾信西班牙問題將爲討論之中心』。在這關於蘇聯消息特別不　通的地方，對此固然無從縣揣，實際上此次聯共大會，討論重心係在國內問題，主要議題是發展蘇聯國民經濟的第三個五年計劃，和修改聯共黨章問題。前者爲求蘇聯國家及人民經濟文化的改進，俾由『各盡所能各取所值』的社會主義社會，進到『各盡所能各取所欲』的共產主義社會；後者則在求依據社會主義新憲法，賦予工農及知識份子以廣泛和平等的　民主權利。這兩者同時都將增加蘇聯人民與國家的力量，使其雖在新的法西斯侵略者包圍合攻之下而能毫無長懼。至於對外，『不受人威脅亦不威脅人』和『維護世界和平贊助民族獨立』的原則决無變更，援助爲民挨獨立解放與世界和平而鬥爭的鬥爭，過去現在以至將來，均將不變不移，對西班牙對中國均無二致。雖然在實施步　上自將因各種特殊條件而有所不同。</p>
<p>日又向蘇聯屈服</p>
<p>日　漁區紛爭事件，這一週來可謂緊張達到頂點，因爲舊的漁約已告期滿，蘇聯定期三月十五日拍賣漁場，日本表示：因蘇聯不允開放漁區，卽將武裝保護漁民在蘇屬漁區捕魚；而　聯則表示：如果日方違約闖入蘇聯漁區，則蘇聯爲條約主權的尊嚴計，决予以懲誡。依這幾天的電訊，蘇聯方面一面積極加强　東陸軍防禦力量，一面加派新銳兵艦兩艘增防海參威，表示其武裝捕漁的决心。日本方面，雖然過去放言無忌，說什麼『不惜對蘇一戰』但其目的原在製造『國難』，以緩和國內反戰情緒，加緊榨取人民血汗，以助其對華軍事，同時亦在企圖轉移國際視線，企圖順利實行其西南攻略和威脅英法的南進政策，何况自張鼓峯挑　慘敗以後，早己嘗到紅軍鐵拳的滋味！那裏敢在此時直接進攻蘇聯！現在日×對蘇已自動洩氣。日本首相外相陸相海相藏相七日會議决定對蘇緩和，並宣佈日本决不放棄談判，交涉至最後一分鐘。自動取消以前决定三有十五日前實特武裝捕漁的宣言。由此可見日×的窘態，周時亦可見日×今日專力進攻中國進攻西南的决意！這又是我們所不能不警惕的。</p>

<p>浦東上南鐵路一帶、情勢緊張、日軍調動頻繁、前數日陸續開出數批、約三四百名、大部轉往　杭線作戰、少數增防西郊、故防務空虛、前日傍晚四時許、又由浦江上遊、調囘陸軍百餘名、在南碼頭登岸、急遽轉赴上甫路終點之周浦鎭駐紮、該項日軍登岸時、南碼頭一帶、臨時戒嚴半小時、又悉上南鐵路、被華軍乘虛破壞路軌　段後、直至二十八日午後、始行修竣、前日上南客車、雖已恢復通行、惟日軍結隊在東三林塘一帶搜查民房、其中雜有偽車、對對正當鄉民、備加滋擾、</p>
<p>遊擊隊開　重要會議</p>
<p>浦東奉南川三縣自被我游擊隊控制後、日偽方面已無法活動、钷在各衝要地點建築堡壘、駐兵扼守、以防我游擊隊襲擊而已、我潛伏各地之游擊隊、爲策應第二期抗戰計、爰於上月某日在奉賢縣境之泰日僑舉行重要會議、此次參加之各遊擊隊領袖、有丁雪山、李志明、于陶生、　興炎、張蕙芳、張妙根數十人、議决要案、有一、組織奉南明上金靑寶嘉八縣游擊隊總指揮部、由丁雪山、李志明、干陶生三氏分任總副指揮、二、尅日　集部隊、定期×月×日總攻日軍、三、組織民眾諜報隊、深入×人防區、採探日軍動態、四、動員八縣民衆、以地方武力、保衞中華土地、五、取　苛捐雜稅、以紓商艱、六、組織流動劇團、表演抗日活劇、七、電請江蘇省政府遴選幹員下鄉、組織縣政府等七件、各游擊隊領袖於會議後、均已分返防地、</p>

<h3>×在華北　貨幣政策失敗　華北民衆對法幣信仰堅定（上）　日人三土忠造供狀</h3>
<p>三月號之「現代日本」中、刊有三士忠造一文、論述×在我國强佔區內之貨幣局勢、與日本之貨幣行動、該文提供驚人資料、例如巳流通於華北之北平偽紙幣、除少數之一千三百萬元以外、其餘均用此等紙幣償付日本之軍費、非爲僅作收囘中國法幣而發出者、該文又謂、日本之「軍用票」、亦用以償付軍費、及掉換法幣、復用法幣購買不能用日幣或偽幣獲得之我國貨物、三土並明白聲稱、偽幣不值正式定價、（即興日元同價之一先令二辦士）、三土之文、顯見渠認×方在華北所施之貨幣試騐計劃、全部失敗、　後、渠証實我國法幣之穩定、與華北民眾對法幣之信任、其所論各節、頗值參攷、茲節譯該文之二節如下、</p>
<p>戰事開始</p>
<p>無人料想其規模將發展至目下之巨大、故决以朗鮮銀行紙幣充軍費、但戰區之擴大、出乎意料、致不能賡續利用此等紙幣、否則將使日本銀行紙幣受非所願有之重負如現所將述者、此種局勢、乃導成在華北設立發行紙幣之新銀行、初擬以河北省立銀行爲核心、而組織一新銀行、但立卽承認此種彌補計劃、均不適當、其第一步驟、務須調整以前華北各銀行、如河北省立銀行與冀東銀行等所發行之紙幣、俾置貨幣制度于鞏固而統一之基礎上、於是　提議的</p>
<p>發行紙幣</p>
<p>之銀行、乃告成立、名曰「華北聯　準備銀行」、經核准資本日金五千萬元、資本之半、全數付出、內一千二百五十萬元由「臨時政府」付出、華北之華方銀行、如河北省立銀行、冀東銀行、鑒業銀行、金城銀行、中國銀行、交通銀行等八家合出一千二百五—萬元、日本各銀行亦貸予信用借款日金一萬萬元、該新銀行之富源、大爲增强、但中國與交通所持有作爲新銀行準備金之白銀、存於英法兩租界者、該兩打拒絕交出之故、乃發生困雞、是項白銀、佔「聯準銀行」之五千八百萬元銀準備之火部份、</p>
<p>的銀擱置</p>
<p>兩租界中、因是項白銀、擬用作一聯準銀行」之最大支持物、其謀攫持乃使『聯準』紙幣之順利流動、受相當妨　、該「銀行」所受一種陣礙爲無力隨意出售外圈、蓋『聯準銀行』猶無充量之外幣存欵也、而其紙幣、今適與日本銀行之紙幣平價、『華北臨時政府』爲使親紙幣成爲流通於其轄區中之唯一銀行紙幣、乃决將曾設分行於平津之華北各銀行所發舊貨幣收囘、自一九三八年三月十日起之一年期限內、舊幣能平換『聯準』紙幣、而總行設上海之華方銀行所發紙幣、即造</p>
<p>禁止　通</p>
<p>估計流通於華北之舊幣共有四萬萬三千元至四萬萬五千元、大多數爲中交兩行之紙幣、自一九三七年三月十日起之九閱月中、『聯準銀行　」收回之舊幣不出一千三百萬元、「聯準」紙幣之流通額、約一萬萬五千萬元、其中大部份乃償付軍費而發出者、「聯準銀行」乃效法「滿洲中央銀行」、採取『中央銀行」解决同樣問題之對付舊幣之方法、「中央銀行」成立時、約有舊幣一萬萬四千元、流通於滿洲內百分之九上九、均於</p>
<p>二載半內</p>
<p>收回、但華北之局勢與「中央銀行　成立時滿洲之情况、大不相同、外國租界之存在、爲最大之陣碍、因外國銀行非特不與「聯準銀行」之工作相合作、抑且頗加阻碍之、華北民眾之信任舊幣、勝於新幣、因滿洲之舊幣價低而無信用、故「滿洲中央銀行」開辦之初、卽能應購買之要求而出賣外匯、而『聯準銀行』則不能如此、另一重要阻碍之點、厥為簡業情况、蓋華北不若「滿洲　」、除與「蒙藏」之貿易外、其餘貿易人超均頗巨也、凡此種種情况、遂使</p>
<p>獲得外幣</p>
<p>一舉、進展頗爲暹緩、「聯準銀行。紙幣、雖不值一先令二辦士、但與日本銀行紙幣同價、因此一事實、乃使局勢續趨盧大、商人旋經鼓勵以舊幣購買「聯準」拼幣、並用「聯準」紙幣價付輸入之日貨、此種辦法、其結果卒犧牲日本銀行紙幣、而已使日本銀行受同等之損失、外國銀行拒不承認新貨幣、乃使『聯準銀行』之外匯情况、復多阻碍、據余所聞、外國銀行之意向、似爲彼等不能接受不兌現之貨幣、</p>

<h3>癖謠！</h3>
<p>汪精衛氏的主和通　，早爲全國人士所唾罵。本港除了汪系機關報××日報以外，亦沒有一家同業不加以嚴詞斥責。至於上海方面，最先把汪氏主和原電全文發表而又痛加擊的就是申報，事實具在，自然亦不容慣於造謠者　，惡意中傷！</p>
<p>那知道本月八日和九日，××日報竟一再散布流言信口誣蔑上海申報發表和平言論，顚到是非，淆亂黑白，可調卑鄙之極，無恥之尤！該報妄指上海申報三月一日社評　所傳之日本「喜多和平計劃」一文，爲申報主張和平的証據，其實該文一則說：「中國對抗戰將閱二十月，…乃惟最後勝利是爭，頑×當前，義無反顧，寗嘗萬難，不求苟安；」再則說：一記者於是深致槪嘆於日本號稱『支那通』中之權威如喜多者，其思想之珞伍，其于中國情况之隔閡，尤於近年中國一般意念之不理解，猶若是之甚，於是尤深信於日本非至一收塗地，自陷於無可收拾之境地、决不悔悟，亦决無折衷解决戰爭奠定遠東之希望：於是更得大膽斷言於中國以持久抗戰而獲得最後勝利、乃是解决載事奠定遠東之最便捷之路程，此外更無掩徑。」隊這樣一斬釘截鐵」的抗戰論調，而××日報居然敢以大字標題，誣攀「滬申報發表和平言論」希望借上海申報以自里，兼圖朦騙全國民眾，所以我們要直斥之爲卑鄙之極，無恥之尤！</p>
<p>××日報究竟自以爲抓住了上海申報什麼把柄了呢？說來實在不值一笑！原來所謂喜多的和平計劃中有「日本撤退其華南之日軍但仍駐軍華北」一條。三月一日上海申報社評即揭露喜多之「猙獰面目」和其「野心」「陰謀」於先，又退一步爲喜多本身設想，如欲表示其提出該項條件的誠意，應該先把該條撤兵一項實行後冉談其他，否則根本不配提出什麼條件。原文中沒有片言隻字表示，日本撤退了華中華南的軍隊以後，就可以駐軍華北；而且任何讀者統觀全文後，亦决不會絲毫懷疑發表那籠力主「持久抗戰」以求「最後勝利，竟社評的上海申報，竟至目毀其一實立塲，附和汪精衛氏允許日本在華北特定地點坦兵的謠見，××日報硬指上海申報主張有條件的和平，又瞎說上海申報表示日本可以駐軍華北，像這種的鄙劣手段，簡直是「含血噴人」，選說不上是「斷章取義」。</p>
<p>至於於××日報稱：『上海申報總主　潘公弼係中央宣傳部駐滬特派員，……有其更切實之背景，」理是『白日見鬼」，『胡說八道』—上海申報總主筆旣不是潘公弼先生，而自去年變，節上海申報復刊以來所有社評亦都沒有撰著人的署名。××日報所惡意造謠，於此又得一鉄証！</p>

<p>二電不同其來歷、不同其主旨、然皆以日本陸軍少將　多之所謂和平計釗爲電訊之唯一資料、特渝電加以駁斥、而英電重在詮釋、肥者孤陋寡聞、媿無綠獲見喜多計劃之本貌、但依據渝英二電而推求之、可以窺知計劃之內容、有六點　、其一、日本表示尊重三民主義、爲中日和平之基調、其二、謀和程序、不復役使北平偽組織爲傀儡、而中日作面談判、其三、和平後之中國政府、仍稱「國民黨政府」、　汪精衛爲主席、其四、對於蔣委員長不復『打倒」「推翻」、而邀請參加所謂「國民黨政府」、居顯要名位、其五、若國民政府同意於此諸條件、則日本撤退其華中華南之日軍、但仍駐軍華北、其六、日本與斡旋和議之外國、共同合作、開發華北經濟、據渝電稱、重慶方面某官員對此喜多計劃、旣於邀請蔣委員長云云、斥之爲絕對侮辱、復揭穿日人所謂國民黨、所謂三民主義、乃係假借名義、招搖撞騙、而使黨國名存實亡之又一餽計、且喝破此與數月來盛傳日方陰謀策動另行組織所謂「新國民黨」之說、如出一轍云、某官員如此見解、如此駁斥、殆人人與有同感焉、</p>

<h3>粵南的戰雲</h3>
<p>近日抗戰局勢漸　緊張，華中華南尤爲嚴重，不過華中之×，雖然野心甚大，但是實力不足，在我雄厚兵力運用新式戰術加以反擊之下，局勢可望無虞，薩南方面，自×軍進陷廣州繼在海南登鐘以後，情勢卽趨嚴重，近傳×軍舉行靈要會議，對于西南，顯有更大野心。數日來×在海南島集中軍艦及運愉艦卅餘艘，同時部隊亦集中海南及圍洲兩處，準備在雷州半島登陸。又據時晚廣州潯訊，徐聞海面×艦仍不斷增加，時派汽艇載×兵往來窺伺，確有企圖登陸模樣。此種行動，雖未必卽係大舉進犯粵南廣西的徵兆，但是我們不能不作嚴密的警備，尤其應當注意的是，×人在此時際，竟在散播「和平」謠言，離間我抗戰團結，鬆懈我抗戰力量，企圖掩蔽其新的進攻行動，漢奸報紙，更從而舖張揚厲，惑亂人心，爲×作倀，輿論界教育界，似應首先喚起同胞的×愾，予×奸此種陰謀以有力的打擊。</p>

<h3>國際形式的轉變</h3>
<p>— 叔</p>
<p>（本報倫敦特約通訊）</p>
<p>世界侵略集團國家所醖釀着的新的國際大危機，漸漸地，有被迎頭　了回去的趨勢。把兩個月以前的情形，和今天比較一下，那顯然的進步，是任何人總可以看得出來的。</p>
<p>日本的突然侵佔海南島，當時，一兩天內，英，法方面的空氣，實際上是現出了異常緊張的徵兆。許許多多的人都作著這樣的疑慮：也許，這就是侵略集團國家有。劃的第一個有力步驟，那末，接着而來的，一定是德意的種楓威脅的舉動了。於是，對於承認西班牙叛軍的問題，立刻出現了一個急轉直下的趨向。不少的人，郡主張：不管西班牙未來內政演變怎樣，英法應搶先一步，趕緊佔領米　加鳥，以確保英，法地中海上的交通，可是，經過了三五天之後，德，意方面，並沒有做出驚人的舉動，去響應日本，於是，這一提議，方始作爲罷論。又過了兩三天，大家已經判明了，日本這回，是在作着趁火打劫的投機想頭，以爲：英，法被德，意爲地中海問題所困住，不得不對她屈服，接受封鎖緬甸和安南邊境，而隔斷中國的軍大運輸。事實上，這一舉動，並不是與德，意的聯合動作。而倒是想藉與德，意同盟的關係，作一次澈底的出賣，那價格，就是：英法帮助她獨佔中國或逼中國政府屈服。不過，日本的這一估計，己經是完全落了空。那証據，就是最近這兩三天來，日本侵佔海南鳥以後的一個禮拜，在英國的各報上，却突然湧出了連篇累牘的斥責和警吿日本這一舉動的文章。爲什麼初起時大家沉默着，現在，忽然警吿斥實日本這一舉動呢？這一點，是值得我們注意和深省的！</p>
<p>那原因，當然是在於整個的國際形勢，以目前英，法·美，蘇聯四國軍備擴張的速度而論，大家都同意，祇要再過一年半載，德，日，意三國的力量，就更　還地落在了後面，到那時，所謂德，日，意集團也者，根本就失去了威脅的作用，那末，也許會自動地分散，逐漸屈服于國際正義與公理之前，也說不定，所以，她們那個重分世界的野心企圖，要提出來的話，祗有在現在，否則，日子越向後，那實現的機曾，也就越渺茫，以英國的兩形而論，大槪兩個多月前，大家是隨時隨地担心着侵略國的突然舉動，這一個多月來，担心是一天一天减少了；代替的，却是猜測：到底這三個國家，準備在什麼時候，甩什麼方式，提出她們那造成國際危戰的種種計劃呢？一直到最近，連這個猜測，也不常聽到了，大家一致的信念，却是：如果英，美，法始終這樣堅持下去。德，日，意絕沒有勇氣對世界和平來一個總的威脅。</p>
<p>所以，最後最後，那唯一的重大關鍵，還是在於英，法，美能不能堅持它們的態度；而尤其要緊的，是：在堅强的過程中，英，美，法，蘇聯這四個國家，會不會始終站在面對着德，意，日威脅下的一條戰綫之上，換首之，會不會被各個地被擊破</p>
<p>大槪在二月初旬，德國的布黑德斯迦登鎭上，曾經召集了一秘密的軍事會議，參加的。是德國所有的東要軍政當局，討論德國的目前重大方針。結果還是和以前一樣地，又分成了兩派，一派是所謂『急進」的，以警察總長希墨勒爲首，强硬地主張德國應當趕緊提出她的一切要求，否則，應當向英，法提出限制軍備擴張的意見。可是一般出席的軍事人員，一致地反對這回計劇，因爲那麼做，一定先來一個軍事的示威，否則，絕不會生效，要是示威的話，最少也嬰等在西班牙目前正在建立中的軍事工程完成之後，而况，萬一示威無效，而開起戰來的時候，那末，德國和日，意聯合起來，還是沒有把握，對英，法，美，蘇聯，中國，等共合作戰的。到這裏素以反英著名的現任外長里賓特羅甫就提出了一個計劃，那是：以暫且祗要收回戰前殖民地卽視爲滿足這一爲點條件，去向英國談判一個對法意糾紛萬一引起戰爭時，德英都不參預的『不干涉協定」。據地看，這一着，一定可以被英國張伯倫內閣所歡迎的；理由是：（一）英國絕對不願打仗的心理，縱使法國被攻擊，祇嬰本身可以有把握不受波及時，也是不會改變的；（二）殖民地問題上，英國有許多親德的要人，都同意可以先把由英代管的德國戰前殖民地，交還給她。他說，這麼一來，可以把法國孤立出來，加以擊敗；那樣情形下，最緊要的一點，是美國不致牽了進去，可是，這一計劃，立刻受到了戈林的反對，以爲是空想。結果，沒有通過。不過，德國最近把別的迫切問題都暫且捆置，而大吹大擂地談殖民地的交還（其實這是和她最根本的方案：在目前海軍未具備充足力量，殖民地問題暫緩一步，這原則相抵觸的）。這一點，值得我們加以注意，希特勒早就表示過：『爲了殖民地問題，德國不致以兵戎和他國相見』。</p>
<p>誠然，量令人担心的，還是央國張伯倫內閣的動搖性。不過假如美國態度不變，張伯倫內閣，想來，也絕不會胃一個重大的倒閉危險，去再另出什麼新的花樣。照目前情形而論，祇要羅斯福幾篇攻擊張伯倫的激烈演說，立刻就會使英國內政起了重大的不安，這是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>美國態度怎樣呢？誰都知道絕對是沒有問題；說它不可靠的，祗是英國張伯倫，西門一流人物的托辭。最近。有一位美國的國會要人。說得很有趣：『假如羅斯福大總統想參戰的話，那末，大部份美國人，都會跟在他的後面。原因是：美國人對於法西斯的德日意三國，早就恨得牙　，希望給它們一個厲害看看！』據他說，美國人中，佷這三個國家的有力份于，計有三：（一）猶太人，（二）天主教徒，（三）尼格羅（卽黑人）。而最近又加入第四　份子；那是：面對着世界市場上德日意三國傾銷競爭的所有的美國資本家。　（二月十七日）</p>

<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>久負盛譽的純粹實科大學　國立同濟大學近況　　今明兩天在本港招考新生</h3>
<p>誰亦不能否認各個文化部門應該平均發展，對於文法科不能有所岐視；但是，誰亦不能否認提倡實科的科學教育，在中國的今日是迫切的需要。</p>
<p>從血腥的教訓中，我們知道過去吃『科學幼椎』的虧委實太大了。在『抗戰』與『建國』的偉業中，有賴於科學者尤多。領袖在此次全國教育會議中，亦明確昭示；『我們這一戰，一方面是爭取民族生存，一方成就要於此時期中，改造我們的民族，復興我們的國家。所以，我們教育上的着眼　，不僅在戰時，還應當看到戰後。我們要估計到我們國家要成為一個現代的國家，那麽，我們國民的知識能力，　該提　到怎樣的水準。我們要建設我們　　成　一個現代的國家，我們在各部門中，需要若千萬的專門學者，幾十萬乃至幾百萬的技工和技師，更需要幾百萬的教師和民眾訓練的幹部。這些都要由我們教育界來供給的。這些問題都要由我們教育界來解决的』——這已够清楚地說明科學教育的重要性，又何况抗戰軍興以來，我們是偏重於宣傳鼓動的努力，而放棄了各種對抗戰建國有迫切需要的自然科學的提倡與努力呢！</p>
<p>因此，我們對於國內負有盛譽的純粹實科大學——國立同濟大學，不能不特別寄予無限的祈望。記者昨天訪問該校駐港辦事處主任王永慶先生（亦是該校高職主任）得悉該校的一般近况，亟應在此為讀者報道，籍以引起讀者對於科學教育的重現。</p>
<p>同濟大學負有三十多年的歷史，初由德國人奠定其基礎。正式收　國立，已經十餘年於茲。現在在行政上　經濟上與德國毫無關係，是道地的一個國立學校。</p>
<p>該校現有學生一千來人，工學院佔四百餘人是最多的一個數日。醫學院有二百人，理學院有一百餘人。附屬高中約三百人。附屬高職亦有二百餘人。工學院分機械，土木·測重，造船等系，理學院分物理，化學，生物三系。高職——　中畢業生投考，四年畢業的職業學　——亦分機械·士木二科。該校並沒有文法科，是純粹的實科大學。</p>
<p>學生學費大學部每年僅國幣十元，高中　年僅國幣五元，高職則完全免費。這與資本主義社會的貴族教育，自然不能同日並語。該校學生的出路，亦正像交通大學·北洋工學院一樣，求過於供·畢業生可以免遭失業的厄運。</p>
<p>該校校址原在上海吳淞，在「八二三」×人炮火之下，已成為灰燼了。幸而員生安全退却，除大規模機器不便搬走外，其餘機件·機器·圖書……等校具皆得內遷，跋涉長途，全體員生現在已經抵達雲南的昆明了。我們各校的校舍雖然是被×人的炮火毀滅了，可是，我們的教育精神却是益加健旺起來，軍委會的第五重傷醫院，就是與該校合辦的。這真是要氣煞了「日本皇軍」了</p>
<p>該校教授，除二十幾個是德籍外，其餘全是中國教授。因為德國是我們的×人的朋友，因此在抗戰發生之後，已有十多個德籍教授雛職去了。神聖的學術有了國界，這亦是『卐』字牌的希德勒先生與他的『好友』——日本皇軍　創造出來的新紀錄。</p>
<p>前此教育部主辦的國立大學聯合新生考試該校亦包括在裏面，且於本月二日，正式在昆明上課，可是，為了利便學子入學，教部特准該校再招生一次，分在昆明，重慶及本港三處舉行。聞投考學生三處已共有一干多人，將來取錄名額則只有四百人而已。</p>
<p>本港方面，截至記者昨天訪問止，報考者共有九十餘人，定於今明兩天假華夏學院舉行入學考試。在這九十餘人中，真光女中佔最多數。且多係高三肄業學生，因為有心向學者怕將來不容易得有在本港招考的機會，亦是因為有「同等學力」的條例所賜予的方便。</p>
<p>該校除高中的中文課程外，其餘多用德文課本，所以，在本港九十多個投考新生中，擬進入德文補習科的，就佔六—多人。補習德文一年及格之後，明年始得正入升入大學本科，這是該校的一個　點。</p>
<p>在抗戰的磨練中，政治已漸漸好轉，科學亦行將抬頭了。一個科學人才除了具備精深的技術之外，還應該有政治的警覺性。該校在校長翁之龍先生　導之下，現又得精明能幹的新任秘書長陳紹賢先生之襄助，繼往開來，正未可限量呢。為了渴慕祖國科學教育的突飛猛進，我們對終純粹實科的國立同濟大學寄與無限的祈望！</p>
<h3>勞工司準備改善工人生活聲中　童工的慘苦生活</h3>
<p>落霞他們是怎樣在非人的壓迫下掙扎！</p>
<p>向來各工廠，每有因貪工金低廉，僱用不足年齡的童工，或將工人的工作時間，超逾定額，使工人健康，遭受打擊，因之，我們感覺到改善童工的生活，不僅暗增進工人的健康，而且是人道的維護！</p>
<p>為了生活的壓迫，很多父母都把他那纔够學齡的孩子，送到工學和商店裏當學徒，我們如果從鐵器店裏和其他小工場經過，看見一個一個穿着骯髒的衣服的孩子，面色是那樣慘白地，坐到地上埋首工作，這些就是學徒來啊！</p>
<p>他們每天從早晨六七時起，做到晚上六七時　止，整天的工柞着笨重的工作，像　送給客人的鐵具，和打着十幾斤的鐵鎚，雖然是身子極度的疲乏，也不敢小作休息，有時候便因為鐵具的過重而吃不消，也得唆緊牙齦，拚死的扛着，他們還沒有發育完全的脊骨，也壓得彎起來了。那種凄楚的情况，是要　人流淚的！</p>
<p>他們每天除掉了做苦力般的苦工以外，就是做些清理地方和其他瑣屑的工作，有些店舖連廚子也沒有僱請的。於是，這些十多歲的小孩子，連煮飯烹飪的責任，也都得肩負起來。告訴你，當「火頭軍」并不是一件容易的事啊！二不小心，便會弄焦了飯，煮壞了菜，那你准會挨一頓打，最低限度，也要受着嚴厲的斥駡，四為僱主們决不會體諒這麽一個做錯事的小孩子的。</p>
<p>這些學徒，吃飽了兩頓白米飯，很多差不多連一毛錢的月薪也拿不到，富滋養的東西，不消說是沒有得吃，就想渴點「凉茶」也是困難的，因為飲食的不調節，和極度的疲勞的交瘁下，他們漸漸地生起病來，特別以肺病佔最大宗；這種病是緩慢地漸進的，他們因為不曉得調治，所以很多都是學技未成，而身先殘廢了的，</p>
<p>自然這種情况，并不限終鐵器店，據我們所知木器店，和其他的店舖都發生着很多這樣的同類事件，一般的老板正瘋狂地利用這些童工來做他們事業的墊脚石。聽說，九籠的一間××社正利用這麽一班無知的小孩來替他們做成各種工藝品，還要替他們做推銷這些製成品的推銷員，而所得的報酬，祗是兩餐一宿，這是一奈多麽上算的生意。記者問起社裏出來推角品物的孩童的待遇，他光着兩眼望着我，他雖然際口不敢說話，但在他青黃色的臉上已綳滿了絲絲痛苦的傷痕—自然，這種童工，總比在黑暗裏摸索的學徒的環境要好一點。</p>
<p>我們感覺到目前這些童工的學徒的生命，好像博賽一樣，成敗就祇相差那麽一線。但是事實上取多很多父母，雖然耳聞這類不幸事件，也甘心拿他的孩子的生命來博賽一下，為的是家境貧窮，而且有些父母想送他的孩于當學徒，也不得其門而入的啊！</p>
<p>調查和警告那些僱主對童工的虐待，加以控懲，那是對改善童工生活的急治方法；但怎麽樣使這些不幸的子孩，全有工作和受教育的均等的機會，那纔是治本的方法啊！</p>

<h3>西江×軍換防忙　×田秘抵河口　×密商西犯詭謀但感兵力單薄　高要四會一帶我與×隔河相峙</h3>
<p>（西　快訊）西江×軍、邇來頻頻換防、廣三總路、廣雲公路、江佛公路，×軍這仍繁、據探報週來各線點×軍較前確有增加，辛線約達三千人、有圖謀　動之勞、西江×指揮闕田、六日曾由佛山秘密抵達河口、召集各部×軍官、密商西犯詭謀、聞×現感西線乓力仍屬單簿、短期內擬暫取守勢、俟兵力補充完竣、然後伺機發動、故運日×軍，一方刖積極加築西南河口馬口崗根一帶工事、增厚九江、河淸、木棉，　崗、左右　實力、以防我軍反攻</p>

<h3>活躍的台山女壯丁　台山婦女救國運動的姿態</h3>
<p>【台山通訊】配台抗戰新階段的需要、合以的婦女界就以極活躍的姿態出現于台山社會了、</p>
<p>過去、台山婦運的功續、曾給我們一個極深刻的印象、自從國民革侖的潮流氾濫到了台山、一向沉寂昨台山社會便奮勇地扯起婦運的旗幟了、那時候的工作、不僅是配合當時的革命形勢、而且也奠定了台山婦運的基礎、台山婦女解放協助會、那時就在政府的領導下、成爲經常的合法團體了、它底工作、是隨着歷史的發展而發展着、一九二五——一九二七大北伐之後，受着一九二九的世界經濟危機底影嚮、和台山各地方文化發展不平衡的客觀條件下、台山的婦運暫時沉寂了下來、婦運會就改組隸屬于黨部了、</p>
<p>「七七」燃起了抗戰的烈火，台山的救亡運動也高漲起來、婦女界當然也不能例外、於是隨着偉大抗戰的洪流、就產生了一個附屬於台山後援會的婦女救亡團體、這團體在一時的熱情下、曾經做過一點事情、可是、因內部組識不健全、和風頭救國主義對領導權的爭奪、終于停滯了工作、</p>
<p>廣州武漢相繼淪陷以後、爲了台山已轉入戰時的狀態，台山的婦女救國運動也走上一個嶄新的方向了、他們是極力避免風頭主義的攪亂、而計劃地去展開工作、而且也收到很大效果的、這一個當前　運的中心機關、就是台山婦女軍事訓練幹部訓練班同學會、</p>
<p>幾個月來的工作是急速的展開、婦訓第一期已經結束了、效果是很好的、縣城區方面、目前除了茶樓裏的女職員與娼妓是例外、在街上你想要見一個抹粉塗脂的女人、是一件不容易的事啊、以前隱在閨閣裏的千金小姐、如今、却是穿起雄糾糾的戎裝底巾幗英雄了、在鄉下呢、也不是像從前那樣的裝羞的、在竹帽底下偷看的女人了、而且、隨便可以聽到她們的說話、有一次我爲了有些事情、到鄉下去、在山路上我聽到兩個年靑女人很淸楚的說、</p>
<p>『這伽地方在軍事上可以做把守的据點』、</p>
<p>「如果日本兵侵佔了台城、我一定從這地方去偷襲他們的」，</p>
<p>「這炮壘裏面如果有一枝輕機關鎗、我敢保守這個關口」、</p>
<p>結束第一期的婦訓、已有如　的收獲了、第二期跟看就開始了、他們最近出版了同學會刊、努力把婦女的抗戰智識提高、消滅戰時婦女的文盲、在這個刊的發刊詞裏也這樣寫着、</p>
<p>除了戰術科給與各女壯丁的技能之外、我們更需要、宣示政治意識動員、</p>
<p>明顯的、她們在第二期婦訓中、就到農村去實施她們計劃的政治意識動員的訓練了、</p>
<p>總之、台山的新生的婦運萌芽起來了、不論在台山任何一個地方、我們都能看到雄糾糾的荷槍實彈的演習着、不僅如此、目前在田間工作的，或在田陌上走路的台山婦女，都不是從前那樣三個女人當一面馬　的支支查查（四字口旁）地亂叫、而變成了一種嚴肅的、雄壯的「起來、不願做奴隸的人們　的歌　了、馬蔭</p>

<p>【江門快訊】日來江門市面當氣、頗形緊張、謠言叠起、惟治安仍良好、軍警團隊日夜嚴密防範、記者昨赴第五區游擊區司令部、晤副司令周漢鈐詢問一切、</p>
<p>×如進攻　樂與週旋</p>
<p>周氏稱，×揚言進攻江門、不自今日始、惟本部所得各方面情報、九江×對新會鶴山兩縣、確躍躍欲求一逞、江門濱海、亦爲×人目標之一、我防軍團隊不以×人之來犯與否以別防守之嚴懈、假若來攻、我軍當樂與週旋、至于市內治安、在嚴密巡緝下、可保無處、目前工作、防妤實爲要務、故對行旅之稽察、不能不特別縝密、</p>
<p>破壞公路　阻×進窺</p>
<p>至于江佛公路、其第四段係在新會境內、由玉崗至雙龍、距江門甚邇、最初奉令破壤、續後修築、恢復通軍、原因爲利便我軍運、刻下新會各屬防務佈置完畢、同時爲防×進攻鶴山、沿隆路斜窺新會起見、當局將該段再度作澈底破壞、由本月八日起、巳不能通軍、新會鶴山兩縣軍事當局、幷經切實聯絡、着着準備云、</p>
<h3>戰地視察　西江前哨「點」　旱塘苦戰指揮官訪問記</h3>
<p>四會縣屬的大沙、距離肇慶有一百里光　、在西江外衛綫上、佔着重要的地位、×人的砲彈炸彈已把　墟塲上的一切毀滅無餘、同時也喚醒了這裏的民衆、踏上了抗戰的路上去、他們那爲保衛家鄉而參加了組織、大家武裝起米了、</p>
<p>一、　場憑吊</p>
<p>前哨點的視察、記者得稅警總團第×大隊黃大隊副錫球陪伴、由大沙抱到最前綫的大瀝岡「灶岡及旱塘」去、這裏距離×陣僅幾百碼寬的一條小河，機關槍每天都交的射來　去、幸喜　一天、寂　戰事、天空沒　黯淡的戰雲、×機也沒有來話動、越過了高低不平的巳經破壞的公路、大沙橋之宏偉工程已經不可復覩、但隨時都可以見到保衛　江的鐵漢之縱跡、村舍間、大樹下、田壟中、隨處都有、談着、美着、三個或五個、</p>
<p>在瀕江的荒岡曼草問、隱蔽着前哨的戰士、雖　海風迎面吹過來有深重的冷氣、然而、戰士們的血是熱的、一心一意地拿着鐵的搶、向前描準，沒有半分鐘和半點閒精神關懷到『衣』的問題上云、</p>
<p>戰壕生活是無限熱烈而緊張的、遙膽前面、×人有　動嗎、我們的英雄便個個磨拳擦掌、聽候着一演身手的良機之來臨、可是發覺×人悄然而去的時候、大家都祇有嘆一口長氣、「這囘又打不成了、等到幾時呢、」是的、我們的勇士飢餓了、迫切地要　胡虜肉、要飲倭奴血、</p>
<p>我們的物質誠然是相當的缺乏、前方工事、也不能盡量利用最新科學去建築起來、然而、這一條戰綫的勇士、却是『一二八』戰役的過來人、對于臨陣的「知己知彼」工夫、確有豐富的經驗、巧妙地築成各式各樣的簡便工事、黃大隊副指示給我們觀察×人打過來的砲彈遺痕、滿山都是洞、但是對于我們戰士的隱蔽壕、根本沒有多大影響、</p>
<p>二慨話戰情</p>
<p>瀕江的舊三水以至大瀝岡灶岡旱塘一帶、已經失而復得了、二月某天、×人大使蠶動、登陸和我們打了一天仗、是廣州失守後西綫最大之戰役、</p>
<p>黃大隊副是這一役的指揮官、說起此役戰情的各方報道、表示遺憾、「那天×人是上午六時許驟然來犯的、大小鋼炮三十多門、飛機五架、以立體戰術向我們的前綫陣地舊三水下瀝崗灶崗一帶猛轟狂炸、整個陣地、陷入了烟焰的包圍圈內、×兵八百多、便乘炮火密集之下在舊三水閣美一帶登陸、我們把火力準備好了，在下瀝崗發現目標、一聲響、集中射、×人猛衝，我們密打，雙方愈迫愈近、×人的大咆每一分鐘至少有二十發、把我們的工事毀壞無餘、我們的弟兄、敏捷地散開、繼續打、過了一個鐘頭、纔退守到灶崗、</p>
<p>「在九點鐘左右、周中隊長仕與太勇敢了、爲保衛這一『點』而奮不顧身、衝入×陣、拗了幾個手溜彈、光榮的犧性了、弟兄們個個咬牙切齒、誓死復仇、不幸灶岡也在無險可守的環境下、退到九　岡竹洲旱塘一帶主陣地來、×人不知死活、依然猛衛、這時兄弟領着援，兵趕到、迎頭反攻過去、</p>
<p>『收容了前線退下來的散兵、堅守着主陣地、馬房方面、也通知準備側　、大沙的弟兄、也飛趕來援、我們在火綫裏、也不知是什麼時候了、衝、衝、猛衝、不准退後半步、弟兄們如瘋如狂、不知有死了、手溜彈、刺刀、一齊使用、盡可能的發揮、格殺了穴七十名×兵、×勢便漸漸頹敗下來、我們再衝殺一回、不讓他們有半秒鐘的喘息機會、我們始終保持主陣地、沒有受到大砲的轟擊而變化，</p>
<p>『大槪在十二點鐘左右吧、我們遂衝到灶岡下瀝岡一帶原陣地了、弟兄們高高興興、向前跑、見×就殺、×人站不住、只有退囘舊三水閣美、我們內爲調整陣地、沒有再追下去、但是、當天下午四點鐘、×兵也不敢再留而退囘三水河口、</p>
<p>『我敢斷定×人的傷亡、確實在一百名以上、其中還有尉官、我們呢、眞的只有幾個弟兄傷亡、打仗時是以一敵五、結算是一與十之比、這是空前的光榮、也是國家的最大榮幸、問中隊長的成仁、我們一方面悼惜、同時慶幸他爲國捐軀、勇烈光榮、</p>
<p>「×人這一天的消耗、炮彈六千多發、機步槍彈無算、所得就是有氣來沒氣去的日本兵尸、</p>
<p>『所有原陣地、現在我們的警戒之掌握中、這幾天很沉寂、大概×人嘗試過這兒的滋味、不敢再來了』、黃大隊副慷慨激昂追述這一次苦戰的經過、</p>
<p>『我們和南潯線上歸來的弟兄、現在緊緊的攜着　手、搭或一度不易搖動的保衛西江之長城了、寄語後方同胞、努力支持前綫的弟兄吧。」高大个子的黃大隊副，陪記者在歸途中堅決地說。</p>
<p>我們誠無限感念西江前綫的衛國健兒、同時也萬分誠懇、切望後方同胞加以熱烈的援助、共同爲爭取最後勝利之實現而努力、小頻</p>

<h3>一百零一條　好萊塢登龍捷徑　（續昨）</h3>
<p>（二九）認議一個人，地知道有人要僱複影人（未　前站在鏡頭前代替主角對光的）的、琪琴却本（JeanChatburn）起初就是做白蓓蘭史　妃的替身、</p>
<p>（三〇）認識一個知道那個攝影場內正需要辦事員的人、瑪格麗塔烈吉（MarKaet　Tallf　chet）起初就是宣傳部內的速記員、</p>
<p>（三一）學用英國口音說話、堂堂皇皇的走進經理室去吿訴他你在英國的演劇經驗、瑪格麗琳賽用此法大得成功、</p>
<p>（三二）讓你母親替你拍一張好相片寄給尋求演員的人、附着、「你應該來看看他本人」的話、因吐鮑勃倍格（Bob　Baker）獲得了鏡頭試驗、</p>
<p>（三三）在大學裏頭足球、然後在加利福尼亞的維尼斯海濱當救生員、像安台第凡（Andy　Devine）那樣、總有一天尋求演員的人要找一個身體組壯的滑稽角色</p>

<p>（三八）在美女比賽會中獲獎、——同時你也還要有點腦子才行、好萊塢是充滿了沒腦干的美麗女郎的、所以獲獎而能在影界成名的却祗有那些能够多學到一點什麼的不多幾個，像紺兒潘屈　（Gaft　Patrlck）、安秀麗登（Ann　Sheriban）、和瑪喬體　佛（MajorleWeaver）、</p>
<p>（三九）做藝術家的模特兒、而這位藝術家常有那　發掘天才演員的人來訪、這就是他們如何找到瑙瑪希拉、琴亞瑟、凱弗蘭西絲了，就是嘉寶、亦是在當情子店機特兒時被發見的、</p>
<p>（四〇）假如你能歌唱、有个姊姊勸你在一個音樂會上演唱、而正有那班找演員的人來聽、行了、奢狄鄭雙萍罷、</p>
<p>（四一）在報紙上或無線電裏宣布好萊塢的一切瑣事、像華爾脫溫吉爾（Walter　Winchell）和傑美費爾特（Limmfe　Filder）、</p>

<p>（四七）在好萊塢大街糖菓店裏、做送送蘇打水之類的工作、也有機會、埃倫持魯（Ellen　Drew），也不過等了一年、</p>
<p>（四八）經友人介紹、在好萊塢的大戲院裏、當女主角的後補演員、誹那位主角引退後、你就是第二個奧麗薇哈佛蘭了、</p>
<p>（四九）加入歌舞班、努力設法排入最前一排跳舞、那樣、尋演員的人就容易看見你了、瓊克勞馥便是如此、</p>
<p>（五〇）是西部著名足球隊裏的凜亮球員、約翰麥克白朗（John　Mack　Brown）就是、</p>
<p>（五一）當某影片公司到南海攝外景時、趕到那兒裝出一副探險家的樣子來、埃洛弗林不是嗎、</p>
<p>（五二）面孔像某大雜誌封面所繒的女郎、拉　西姆（Larry　Simms）就是這樣被發見的、</p>
<p>（五三）在健身場的淋浴間裏唱歌、希望　室有一個影片公司內的音樂指導聽見、如安東妮瑪羅（Anthooy　Marlow）</p>
<p>（五四）進好萊塢高等學校念書、在兩課之間、上學校對面的吃食店吃早飯、忽然進來了一個影片公司內的朋友、賴哪端納（LansTurner）就成了演員、</p>
<p>（五五）試做一個臨時演員——現在這樣的機會不大有了、臨時演員都拒絕新人加入、但是你若已經是個臨時演員的話、把衣裳穿得比別的臨時演員大滿好、這個方法很有助於阿這夫孟郁</p>
<p>（五六）做十八年攝影師、一且在自己的開末拉前表演些滑稽姿勢、大衛吳立佛（Davfd　Oliver）也成了滑稽演員、</p>
<p>（五七）領導美國爵士樂隊在意大利的維尼斯演奏、於是曼琳黛維絲來勸他試演電影、這是司各脫柯爾登（Scott　Colton）的方法、</p>
<p>（五八）在夜總會裏表演精彩節目、但看李茲三兄弟、瑪莎雷、瑪哥（Margo）等人、</p>
<p>（五九）假如你面貌像某一明星、而且說話的神態也能像他、那末跑進影片公司請求試驗罷、佛蘭基勃克</p>
<p>（Frankie　Burke）就這樣地得到了在Angels　WfthDirty　Faces一片中演占姆斯　克奈幼年時的脚色、</p>
<p>（六〇）跑進公司、堅稱你是一個著名女演員的弟兄（姊妹出行），請求試驗、有一個孩子就用了本法在未拆穿之前、非但得到試驗、而且得到一個脚色、祗要他演得好、公司方面也不追究了、</p>
<p>（六一）曉得一個分配演員人家裏的電話號數、通個長途電話給他、請在新片中、給一個角色、瑪麗波華（Mary　Bovard）用此法得到第一個角色、</p>

<h3>華隊兩雄大會戰　爭奪銀牌决赛權　今日下午四時在掃埔塲舉行</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】是屆特別艮牌足球賽、甲組方面、有因和局以致超出二次或三次之競爭、而後解决勝負者、數數見矣、故寥程爲之延長、乃尙有準决賽一幕，於今日下午四時方在掃桿埔塲舉行、此爲南華南對東方、其得勝者則獲决賽權、而於來月與警察會作爭標戰。</p>
<p>複賽時、南南經三戰而後淘汰九龍會、東方亦經兩戰而後繫退南華華、故得有今日之準决賽、實非倖致、巧用血汁凝結而成之勝利、惟最可惜者、此兩枝强有力之華車、同入一組、未得分道揚鑣、共會於决賽之時、徒美另一組中宵　得志、有警察之冷門突出、然警察非冠軍相、其得决賽權、乃幸運所由致耳、</p>
<p>以形勢推測、警察既非勁旅、力不足以爭標、是則今日之戰、等於决賽、其得勝者不營視冠軍爲囊中物矣、但兩虎相　、必有一傷、姑無論勝和屬諸何方、惟失敗者卽　入岐途、宣吿絕望、故成功與失敗之分界、在此一舉、誰能爭得華人足球之領袖地位、亦决於此也、</p>
<p>此項準决賽、與决賽、均採九十分鐘制、與初賽及複賽不同、總會復鑑於過去常有和局發現、今日華隊兩雄相遇、誠難逆料其結果如何、若戰成難解難分之局、亦屬意中事、故日前舉行月會時曾有决議、如今日該兩隊於　完規定此賽時間及加倒猶未分勝负者、則於明日補賽、如明日又戰和、則於下星　三日再决雌雄、</p>
<p>連日天氣不常、乍晴乍雨、今日如何、尙難預料、但願老天有情、莫誤球場好事、則此幕大戰、定多精彩演出、老天公不予方便、則場濕球重、適足影嚮雙方　人之　作、而缺少良好言献、且在雨中作戰、於勝負問題、不能以技術優劣爲定評、故天氣如何、乃一值得重視之事也、</p>
<p>兩隊實力達於若何程度、是和着抑是相等、在此役中、當有顯明之表露、而予看客一目了　矣、悄實力之估計、斷不能以兩隊在聯賽過程中之各勝一次、遂認爲軒輕不分也、</p>
<p>照事論事、南南乃一善於運用作戰方式之隊伍、進　有據、聯絡週到、故每戰以巧勝人、尤有一優點、則爲各自久歷戎行、經騐豐富、臨大戰而不亂、遇勁敵而愈堅、據請　　、此乃歷驗　爽者，今。處此重要關　、又早有準備、料其各員演出、當不致操諸過急、使技術上有反常之弊也，反之、東　自晉陞甲組以來、對聯賽及　牌兩項錦標、從未染指、今值全隊至有進境之際、　得此項準决賽　、實　二前機會、　員對　、未免華涎欲滴，得之爲快，且唯一難關、乃在今日、若能一舉而勝、則大好錦標、將爲其所有矣，因楚之故、各員咸下决勝之心、對勝　方面、必過於重視、亦過於興奮、惟此種影響、成則氣愈壯、敗則心愈急、故勝負問題之重要關鍵、須視第一球之營屬於何方、若東方失球在先、當不免愈急而愈亂矣、至其以往作戰、無所謂方式　惟定鋒善於突襲、守將忠於職守、而其今日能吾壓倒南南、亦乃全視突襲能否成功，但南南非等間可比、恐東方未易得逞也、</p>

<h3>重要的腿部</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>談到肌肉或體力、一般所謂强健的人、不是拍拍胸部就是把袖子拉起來、顯出他們的手臂、很少人會注意到腿部、</p>
<p>鍛鍊體格與建造一所房屋無異、欲使一所房屋穩固、最重要的是堅强的基礎、腿部就是我們身體的基礎、</p>
<p>我們的體力與兩腿有密切的關係、如腿部肌肉落後、雖有强大的臂力亦不能發揮出來　况且欲有強大的體力　必須有　　的背部、腿部肌肉落後　人十　沒有强健的背部　因爲欲使背部強健　必須做到劇　的運動、而多數劇　的背部運動皆與腿部有相互的關係，　言之、多數劇軍的背部運動也就是最好的腿部運動、如「硬舉」（Dead　Lift）「深　　」（Deep　Knce　Ben）等對於發逹背腿兩部的肌肉皆有最大的功效、</p>
<p>欲使臂、肩、胸等部發逹至最完善的地步，非從事劇爲的運動不可。但如背、腿兩部的肌肉落後、縱能勝任劇重的運動、有受傷的危險、有許多人、臂部肌肉非常之發逹、但　力並不　大、也就是運動過於輕易之故、從事輕易的連動、如增加運動的次數、至肌肉疲乏或甚至酸痛爲止，也能使肌肉發速起來、但對於體力的鍛練則無甚功效、由此可知、腿部肌肉如過於落後、不僅使我們不能發　上身强大的體力、對於上身、甚至全身各部的鍛煉亦有很大的妨礙、</p>
<p>倘若我們忽略腿部的鍛鍊而專門從事於上身的鍛鍊、在目前也許有很好的成續、但發　肌肉和鍛練體格並非目前的事、我們如忽略腿部的鍛鍊、在若干時日之後、各種弊害必層出不窮、如進步頓形遲慢或甚至完全停止、肌肉呈削瘦的狀態或息肌肉僵硬的弊害、以及體力與肌肉不能平衡發展等、</p>
<p>欲使肌肉發達至最完善的地步、必須輕重、腿部亦如是、但腿部是我們身體上最强健的一部、如祗從事徒手　操絕不能使其發逹至最完善的地步、非從事劇重的器械運動不可、　（一）</p>

<h3>值得關懷的上海文化界</h3>
<p>— 黃繩</p>
<p>英界羅湖的投彈，上海租界的威迫，這是日本『政治進攻』的辛辣的戲法，他已經刺中了對手的弱點，而獲得初步的順利，以二萬元的『誤炸』陪款，進行着好些問題的討論；以完全的虛聲恫嚇。完成了『上海協定』的締結。</p>
<p>這樣的進農，雖還不能預料後果如何，然所謂『上海協定』，已使上海租界在實際上成爲日本代管的殖民地，成了十足的恐怖世界。公共租界的主權原操諸中國，工部局私下和日方訂約，是蔑視我主權！是我們要堅决反對的！</p>
<p>在這非常嚴重的局面下，我們特別關懷上海的文化界，在『上海協定』裏，就赫然有『取締抗目報紙』一項，而日本在租界旣成爲無法無天的實際主子，對於一切進步的文化活動，當然加以高力的禁壓，今後進步的文北界的一切行動，將變爲非常艱苦，所以，如何掃蕩這密集的暗雲，就不祗上海文化界應加勞力，全國文化界都應該加以特別的注意。</p>
<p>抗戰前，上港是文化人的大本營，是出版事認的繼匯，在傳播文化和提高文化上，上海成爲一個動力的源泉，不說遠的，文化思想上的愛國主義運動是在上海發動的，這一個運動簡直是民族解放導動的信號，是抗戰的前奏曲，抗戰發動後，八一三的文化軍歌成爲一個巨響，隨着是文化人的有計畫的『疏散』，佈置了全國性普遍發展的新的陣容，雖然道文化動力的母胎也因而有過一時的頽勢，但工作者的艱苦支撑和積極奮鬥，不久便又使上海文化踏上了返老還言的道路，重新出現了活躍的雄姿，特別是在出版事上，仍站在最高的地位，所以日本企圖『』征服』上海租界，必先以進步的文化界爲首要對象，爲的是中國抗戰文化的高速發展是對日本侵略的一個有力的游擊。</p>
<p>所以，我們要運用一切力量來衛護上海的進步的文化界！</p>
<p>察看了上海孤島的危機之後，我們的目光自然而然的投到這裏來，這個『安樂窩』的邊旁已落過日本的炸彈，我們的頭上也已掠過古怪的飛機。這裏已不是風平浪靜的附在，太平洋的險惡的波濤，會把這地方捲進了『多事之秋』！特別是不由我們作主的妥協政策的進行，隨時會在我們的路途上佈下了荊棘，所以我們已經要準備一下披斬的工夫。</p>
<p>文化工作者團結起來，口號已經響着了，是的，團結就是力量，集體力量足以打破一切難關，工都局和日本『上海協定』的締立，黨給我們不祗要有口號，更要緊的是實踐！</p>
<p>要知道我們的成續不及上海的作者，我們的力量顯得非常脆弱，也就更容易受到挫折，而且，環繞着我們散播毒素，所以我們合力工作的基礎要快快的打好，我們的『滅蠅』工作要有效地地進行！</p>

<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>天上的白雲，地上的白雪，漸漸地暗淡了，暗淡在黃昏中、這白雲和白雪之間，是分不淸的白色一片：是雲？雲和雪，已被暴風所混、混成茫然一切，一切都在朦朧中、失去原形。這是寒帶最平常的景色，而成爲熱帶人們所幻想不到的奇異的夢。</p>
<p>這里的寒冷，可以毀滅一切動植的生命。人們傳說，寒帶是可怕的地方，可以凍掉手脚，可以凍僵血流，可以把完好地面凍得破裂，由於寒冷所造成的故事是有事實的根據的，人們爲了征服寒冷，而與自然搏鬬，因此，也啓發了人們的勇氣與智慧。是的，滿洲是寒冷的。然而，如果有人的誕生地，是滿洲；他一且與滿洲離得長久，他會常常呼喚起來：</p>
<p>『滿洲，我可愛的故鄉！』</p>
<p>這時候，滿洲是他的朋友，他的母親，他的情人的懷抱。這時候，滿洲，不是寒冷的，而是温暖的了。尤其是被鐵鞭驅逐了的流亡者，祗　他記起了滿洲，在流亡的途上，他會害了思鄉病而瘋狂，他會爲了歸去，不惜犧牲；同時，被銑鎖鎖在滿洲以內的受難者，祇要他不忘了滿洲，他會爲了滿洲的自由而奮鬥，一直到死。</p>
<p>滿洲，永遠是佔有着人們的記憶的；比方說滿洲的雪，偉大而聖潔。</p>
<p>他就是滿洲的　的化身，雪的使者！</p>
<p>這有　的都市　在風雪中，也由繁榮　爲　敗。往日晴空下擠滿人的街頭，也成了冷寞的空地。街邊，手風琴的　浪人，停止了呼喚同情的參昔，貧　的乙討者，也不冉把手伸在衣袖外，仲到行人的面前；他們已經在破人遺棄，或是忘記的角落，闢始尋找夜的處。一切都漸漸地安息了。　在而未安息的，彷彿祇有那一面叛了祖國的旗了，議一支不大健壯的旗竿，支撑着自己不可逃避的危運，勉强地掙扎而飄蕩——在松花江的岸邊。（三）</p>
<h3>我們守在桐柏嶺</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>我們這一線，是担任固始至商城的防務。前面三十師已經和×人接觸了。×人攻取商城的途徑，除了從葉家集富金山宣攻外，其次的要路就是從固始南下，攻擊商城的北側。東邊二十里地外，是一帶山地，師長指劃着縣在牆上的地圖，嘴里念警：『桐柏嶺，當金山，葉家集。』一面標出當地拒敵我軍的番號。</p>
<p>『現在我們已經進入情况了，』師長說：『一切都要特別小心，特別準備。隨時隨地，我們都有遭遇到敵人攻擊的可能。』</p>
<p>『×人進攻的目標，一是商城，一是固始，我們這一帶地方，正夾在中間，雖然前方沒有大接觸，位置却非常重要。』</p>
<p>到這一帶地方，人民反而像是安靜，不見有人逃跑，戰爭這事情沒有引起他們的注意，他們倒是趁這時候，作起軍隊的生意。大砲整天吼叫，他們不懼怕，飛機時常飛來矗炸，他們瞧不見飛機踪影，仍然囘到自己的家里。</p>
<p>『你們不害怕麼』？</p>
<p>『你們老總都不害怕，我們老百姓怕什麼！』</p>
<p>從師部里發下來妻種表格，每人塡一張，包含姓名籍貫年歲通信處等項。同志們一邊塡寫，一邊笑着說：</p>
<p>『怎麼，這是要預備升官的履歷表麼？』</p>
<p>旁邊馬上有人說出不同的意見來：</p>
<p>『你可想得好，升官那有那樣運氣。』</p>
<p>『依我看，陣亡之後，預備調查的吧？』</p>
<p>『對一定是這種意思。』</p>
<p>同時，還接到師部命令，符號袖章以及武裝帶全解除，無論官兵，全紮橫皮帝。聚張了，這分明是開火前夕的情况。</p>
<p>大家夥磨掌跳脚的，樂得不了，從內心里迸出來罕有的歡笑，在各個臉上浮動。興奮緊張而又沉靜。</p>
<p>『幹哪，看這一回！』</p>
<p>『媽的，怕死不算好漢！』</p>
<p>同志們忙着印刷油印壁戰報，宣傳漫畫，並有人作著動員民衆的工作。使他們騰解抗戰時的意義，，進而幫助軍隊幹些事情。</p>
<p>從旅部戰囘來的同志，商量着到前面去寫些對敵的標語，離開旅部不上十里地的山嶺中，已經有敵人的便衣隊伍活動了，並且探聽到山嶺中還有偽滿軍隊六七百名。標語預備刻在樹幹上，再在牆壁上寫粉筆的大字標語，那些偽滿隊伍，是我們一家人，我們要使他們淸醒，那些預寫的標語是：</p>
<p>『中國人不打中國人『</p>
<p>『東北弟兄們。聯合起來打倒日本軍關！』</p>
<p>『東北弟兄們，律轉槍桿去射擊我們的共同敵人——日本皇軍。』</p>
<p>『東北弟兄不作奴隷，歡迎你們携械歸來。』</p>
<p>這夜，十點鐘，率到團部的命令；出擊桐柏嶺。</p>
<p>在十二時之前必需出發，天前趕到預定地點，開始圍擊。</p>
<p>這一個命令到底來到了，天亮時候，一定要獲取日光一般的光明的勝利的。</p>
<p>這將是一個偉大的開始呢。……</p>
<h3>創立健全的連環圖畫</h3>
<p>— 寒波</p>
<p>偶然從連環圖書　　上，發現幾部采用新的題材的畫本子，例如『情天血淚』『夜半欲聲』『雷兩』『珍珠衫』『王先生』『牛鼻子』一類本是銀幕與漫養中的故事，現在都一一搬進連環圖畫的世界中了，從那疊絕的封面上看來，可知已被無數人看過，已把印象刻人無數人的臘海中，產生了巨大的影響。</p>
<p>不過很抱臩的是我們却沒有發現過一二部介紹介可歌可泣的抗戰史蹟，與優秀的抗戰文學底連環圖畫，她們一面想穿上時代的外衣，一面却又擺脫不掉因襲的束縛，這就是最近連環圖畫所走的新趨勢。</p>
<p>限制了連環圖畫向上發展的障物。是</p>
<p>1濃厚的對建意識；</p>
<p>2抹却主題，僅求熱鬧與取悅讀者的生意經；</p>
<p>3粗製濫造的藝術形式與拙劣的文學說白；</p>
<p>4虛溝的落伍的舊題材；</p>
<p>這幾點合併起來，就形成文學中一個特殊部門的連瓊圖畫了。</p>
<p>連環畫商人想利用舊形式來配合新題材，但却不曾克服了上述的障碍物，酒瓶沒消過毒，就裝入新酒，那是換湯不換藥的把劇，連環畫現在固已轉入採用新題材的階段。然而若去採取那些恐怖，偵探，滑稽，戀情一類的脚本，無疑的又楚一椿極大的錯誤，並且若未揚棄了舊的渣滓，卽使是最好的題材。也會歪解了的，所以目前首先當剷除許多年以來根深帶固的惡習，以簇新的姿態將適台抗戰的題材容納于無毒的舊形式中，建立一座健全的連環圖畫堡壘，我們當然也知道商人有商人的生意經，然而我們更明瞭這是一椿不會虧本的任務，所要求於他們的，只是一番轉變，商人爲什麼不站到大多數人的方面來呢？</p>
<p>談到意識主題與藝衛形式一類問題，那該是文化人分內的事了，運環畫有了轉變的生機是一樁很可喜的事情，我們應該有人去領導此項運動，貢献意見並策動其作多方面的發展，便不致趨于歧途，同時，不但僅爲了都市內的學齡兒童，且必須顧到戰塲上將士與鄉村大衆的需求，含有正確意識的通俗圖文最適于充作文章下鄉與文章入伍的先鋒，以前有人倡導過這回事，現在該是亟應復興的時候了，復就純文學立楊論，連環圖也是向初學者介紹傑作名著的最好工具，『死魂靈』百圖很予續者以深刻的印象。帮助瞭解原文的內容，尢爲有力，這是當前文化繪圖工作人員值得倡效的事。連環圖是這時代文化的落伍者，但如我們能創立一个建全的運環圖陣綫，那末他的效力又將站在文化界的最前綫了。</p>

        <h1>1939.03.11</h1>
<h3>Regarding Spain</h3>
<p>The situation in Spain has taken a sharp turn. There are widespread reports that "the Spanish Republican Government's Defense Council's attitude is unclear, and ceasefire negotiations between the Defense Council and Franco's government seem to have begun." Although this news has been displayed prominently by newspapers with large, special-font headlines, those with even a little understanding and insight into the current situation will not be unduly surprised. This is because, since the rulers of Britain and France have continued to compromise and concede to the two major aggressors, Germany and Italy, and have effectively recognized the Franco government of the Spanish rebels, it has become clear that the two countries' rulers are using maximum pressure on the Spanish Republican government, which they once formally recognized, to deprive it of any power to resist and continue all-out war, in an attempt to achieve the "peace" and "development" of Spain, as envisioned by the handful of financial capital leaders they represent. Therefore, the questions for us today, especially for the Chinese people who are continuing their heroic resistance against Japanese aggression regarding the situation in Spain, are: Will the heroic struggle of the Spanish people against fascism and aggression end in complete failure? What impact will the evolution of the situation in Spain have on Europe and the world? What important lessons and experiences does the Spanish issue offer to those seeking peace and freedom in the world and in China?</p>
<p>First, we know that the "civil war" in Spain is a war waged by the vast majority of the Spanish people seeking peace and freedom, under the unified leadership of the Republican government of the Popular Front, to resist the Franco rebel army, which is commanded and supplied by German and Italian aggressors, invading the homeland and ravaging their compatriots. Although this war has suffered significant setbacks, and even so-called "peace" negotiations have made "progress" or even achieved "success," due to the frantic attacks of the German and Italian fascist aggressors and the single-minded oppression of the British and French rulers, under the rule of Franco, who is controlled by the German and Italian fascist aggressors, and with the implementation of a thorough policy of compromise by the British and French rulers, the "success" of "peace" will not only fail to bring the Spanish people the true peace, democracy, and freedom they seek, but will also intensify internal autocratic oppression and foreign division and plunder. Therefore, the war in Spain is bound to become more intense in another form.</p>
<p>Second, we know that, regardless of foreign pressure and the collusion and coercion of domestic traitors, the vast majority of the Spanish people who demand true peace, democracy, and freedom, especially those with the experience and lessons of more than thirty months of heroic struggle, will continue to advance a more heroic, resolute, and powerful struggle. This struggle will develop widely in various regions, and they will severely strike at the "development" work of the Franco reactionary regime and any foreign aggressive forces. They will also seriously and practically advance the Popular Front and the anti-fascist, anti-aggression united front, and they will establish their own organs of power of the people in various occupied areas to lead them in their struggle for true peace and freedom. After more than thirty months of fighting, the national economy, agricultural, and industrial production in Spain have undergone tremendous changes. The revolutionary parties and the Popular Front, which correctly, enthusiastically, and heroically lead the revolution, have learned richer and more reliable winning strategies and tactics in the war, and their influence and power are beginning to develop. Moreover, today, the Republican government still controls one-quarter of the central region, with nine important provincial capitals, and more than 500,000 heroic and well-trained troops, and in cities such as Madrid and Valencia, there are arsenals sufficient to supply themselves. Therefore, we can still assert that the Spanish war has not stopped, and an even greater struggle is yet to come!</p>
<p>Third, although the mediation of the Spanish war has reached the stage of "success," and so-called "peace" conferences, even if they make progress under external pressure, none of these can curb the further dangerous ambitions of the Italian and German fascist aggressors in Spain and Europe. Britain and France will certainly not be able to obtain temporary peace in Europe from concessions in Spain. In fact, once Franco's rule in Spain is realized, the fascist countries will gain a great advantage in Western Europe. France is already surrounded on three sides, and the threat to Britain's maritime lifeline is becoming increasingly serious. The fascist countries, which now tout anti-communism, have begun the process of changing the map of the world. With British routes in the Atlantic and Gibraltar controlled, the British and French colonies in North Africa are successively included in the first step of the plundering plan. In addition, Germany is actively preparing to invade Southeast Europe, and Japan has taken the opportunity to strengthen its control over southern China and implement the occupation of Hainan Island, threatening all the colonies of Britain and France in the Far East. "Appeasement and bribery will never buy peace," and here is another fresh example.</p>
<p>Fourth, the drastic changes in the Spanish situation have, of course, already been and will continue to teach the people of Spain, Britain, and France, and their struggle against fascist aggression and compromise will be actively developed under the correct and unified leadership of revolutionary parties. At the same time, the facts of blood and tears in Spain further teach every Chinese soldier seeking liberation to maintain a high degree of vigilance against all internal tendencies to waver, compromise, seek peace, and surrender, and to expand the pursuit of all international sympathy and assistance based on the principle of self-reliance, especially to consolidate, develop, and protect our country's connection with the Soviet Union, the cornerstone of peace, with the greatest strength. As for those traitors who attempt to exploit the Spanish situation and undermine our country's war of resistance with heretical arguments such as "Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are not reliable" and "China's anti-communism and pro-Japan stance is the right path," we should use the fact of "internal unity and adherence to resistance" to break this new conspiracy.</p>
<h3>A Week in World Trends</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From March 4th to 10th</p>
<p>March is a vibrant season, and the first week of March has already passed in vibrancy. In this extraordinarily turbulent world, we clearly see the clash of two major tides. On one hand, there is the fascist aggression front, led by Japan, Germany, and Italy, which, under the compromise and concession policies of rulers in certain capitalist countries, is even more frantically fueling the flames of war. Japan is launching even more rampant offensives towards China and the South China Sea, Germany towards Southeast Europe, and Italy towards North Africa. On the other hand, there is the democratic peace front. Although the rulers of a few countries continue to compromise and concede to the aggressors, the broad masses are striving for the consolidation and development of the democratic peace front. The progress in Britain is quite astonishing. And the Soviet Union is holding the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, unleashing an even more irresistible anti-fascist and anti-aggression force that will spread throughout the world. To develop this force with greater effort is the common task of all the oppressed masses and people of peace and justice today.</p>
<p>A Week of the War of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>The Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan, striving for independence and freedom and resisting fascist aggression, has persisted for a full twenty months. The situation in the last four months has appeared relatively stable, marking the characteristic of the war of resistance transitioning from a stage of [Japanese] superiority and our inferiority to the second stage of [Japanese] and us in stalemate. However, our military progress has not yet reached the necessary level, and the weakening and striking of [Japanese] combat power has not reached a fatal degree. The transformation of the situation of [Japanese] superiority and our inferiority is only beginning, so the [Japanese] still retain the power to continue their offensive. At the same time, because the front lines are becoming longer and the war zones are expanding, the [Japanese], although they have the power to continue their offensive, are facing enormous resistance due to insufficient and dispersed troop strength. We must target this situation, increase its difficulties, and weaken its strength. This week, the [Japanese], in order to boost their exhausted morale and strengthen their control of the occupied areas, and also attempting to recklessly continue their advance, adopted an active offensive on all fronts, especially in central Hubei Province, launching large-scale westward offensives along the Jing(shan)-Zhong(xiang) Road and the Han(kou)-Yi(chang) Road, while also frantically bombing Yichang, Xiangyang, and Fancheng. Because our front lines were consolidated and we quickly launched counteroffensives against the flanks and rear of the [Japanese] army, the [Japanese] were unable to cross the Han River and Xiang River. By March 10th, the situation in central Hubei had returned to stability. In South China, although the [Japanese] continued to reinforce, attempting to invade the Nanlu area via Beihai and spy on Guangxi and Yunnan, our proper response has prevented the [Japanese] from making any progress.</p>
<p>Great Victory for Our Army on the Northern Front</p>
<p>In North China, because our armies and parties and the people correctly implement the united front's program of resistance against Japan, they are launching counteroffensives everywhere against the flanks and rear of the [Japanese] army, containing and weakening the [Japanese] army, and instigating the mutiny and surrender of the [Japanese] army and puppet troops. The overall situation of the war of resistance in Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces is showing increasing signs of victory. According to reports from our military authorities, in the second half of February, our army actively engaged in operations in various locations, fighting 404 times, capturing more than 2,000 rifles, and killing 21,385 [Japanese] soldiers. In Shanxi, there were 203 battles, killing 723 [Japanese] soldiers and capturing 564 [Japanese] officers and soldiers. In Henan, there were 46 battles, killing 2,020 [Japanese] soldiers and capturing 5 [Japanese] soldiers. In Hebei, Chahar, Jiangsu, and Shandong, there were 75 battles, killing 3,490 [Japanese] soldiers and capturing 109 [Japanese] officers and soldiers. In Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, there were 56 battles, killing 1,875 [Japanese] soldiers and capturing 28 [Japanese] officers and soldiers. Furthermore, according to a Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 2nd, in the two months of December of last year and January of this year, the Eighth Route Army fought 256 times against the Japanese and puppet troops, killing 10,000 Japanese and puppet troops and capturing 1,600 puppet troops alive. In December, there were 109 fierce battles, killing 3,743 Japanese and puppet troops, capturing 555 Japanese soldiers and 882 puppet troops alive, seizing 1,234 horses and 1,743 rifles. The total number of deaths and injuries in the Eighth Route Army was 1,554, and 40 rifles were lost. In January, there were 154 fierce battles, killing 7,010 Japanese and puppet troops, capturing 31 Japanese soldiers and 157 puppet troops alive, seizing 957 rifles, and 2,713 puppet troops surrendered to the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army suffered 417 casualties, of which 1,503 died from poisoning, and 38 rifles were lost. The [Japanese] army is currently preparing to launch a "mopping-up" operation in North China with 18 divisions, including 5 divisions in northern Jiangsu, 3.5 divisions in the Pinghan Railway area, 1.5 divisions in the Daoqing Railway area, 6.5 divisions in Shanxi Province, and 1.5 divisions in Suiyuan and Shaanxi. The Jin-[Japanese] have already launched a three-pronged invasion of Yueyang. This is something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>New Stage of Women's Liberation</p>
<p>March 8th, International Women's Day, was warmly commemorated by women across the country. Currently, for Chinese women to seek liberation, they must first ardently support and participate in the struggle for resistance against Japan and national reconstruction to achieve national liberation. The liberation of the Chinese nation must also be achieved with the participation of more than 200 million women nationwide in order to achieve final success. Moreover, China is already the China of the world. The liberation of Chinese women and national liberation are also closely related to the liberation of the world's people and oppressed masses. Therefore, we must also consolidate and develop the world's women's united front against fascism and aggression in order to strive for final victory. Women leaders such as Soong Ching-ling, Soong Mei-ling, and He Xiangning have all published insightful articles or speeches on the new tasks of the new stage of the women's movement. The commemoration of March 8th by the women's circles in Hong Kong was particularly enthusiastic, especially the unanimous passage of the resolution to organize the Women's National Salvation United Association, establish a united front for the women's liberation movement, and work hard for resistance and refugee relief. This is such an exciting thing! On the same day, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article praising Chinese women, saying: "Since the start of the Japanese invasion, Chinese women have been most active in fighting for the freedom of their motherland. On the front lines and in the rear, Chinese women can be seen jointly defending their country with their brothers and husbands and resisting the Japanese. The heroic acts of Chinese women have made a glorious contribution to the history of China's national liberation war." It is hoped that every female compatriot will repay the expectations of international friends with even more heroic struggles and, moreover, be especially prepared in the struggle to overcome the even more dangerous future environment and intensify self-education work to cultivate new work cadres.</p>
<p>National Education Conference Concludes</p>
<p>The National Education Conference opened on March 1st, held ten plenary sessions, and concluded successfully on the 9th. The conference discussed more than 300 proposals and received more than 100 suggestions from outside the conference. The first achievement of this conference was the passage of a temporary motion, making President Chiang Kai-shek's address to this conference on March 4th the highest guiding principle for our education in the future. President Chiang's address explained the implementation of educational policies for resistance against Japan and national reconstruction, making the revolutionary Three People's Principles the highest standard for education nationwide and making education serve the unity of the whole country for a sustained war of resistance. This is precisely what all sectors have long hoped for, and the national education sector must make special efforts to follow it in the future. Second, the discussions and declarations of this conference also fully demonstrate that education will serve the resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. For example, in primary school education, attention is paid to the implementation of labor disciplines; in normal school education, attention is paid to student internships; in higher education, physical education is implemented; and efforts are made to make military training universal. These are all major improvements in education in the future. What is particularly commendable is that the declaration clearly states: "We plan to enrich social education facilities and design adult literacy education and electrical education. We want to improve and strengthen the education of overseas Chinese. We want to care for the youth in areas occupied by the [Japanese] and in the rear of the [Japanese], and the compatriots who generally want to receive national education in our war zones. We have a plan and will definitely promote it actively." Yes, it must be actively promoted! Especially the popularization of compulsory education and the cultivation of a large number of anti-Japanese cadres.</p>
<p>New Sino-British Loan Established</p>
<p>The new British loan of 5 million pounds to China was announced by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon in the House of Commons on March 8th. We should recognize that, first, why is Britain able to lend to us? The reasons are: (1) Japan announced that it would control foreign exchange in North China from March 10th and prohibit the use of legal tender, which greatly damaged British investment markets in China, and the Japanese aggressive forces are increasingly developing, threatening British interests in China and the entire Far East. Therefore, it used loans to China as the first step in economic retaliation; (2) The Chinese government, army, and people have bravely resisted Japan for 20 months, the country is united, political progress is being made, and the future is infinitely hopeful. This makes Britain realize that only by actively assisting China can it safeguard its rights and interests; (3) The entire British people, especially those with investment relations in the Far East in industry and commerce, in view of the British government's non-intervention regarding Spain, unanimously opposed it. In order to prevent such actions from appearing in the Far East, anti-fascist, anti-aggression, and aid-China and anti-Japanese movements in various places are like raging waves, forcing the British government to take active steps. Second, what impact will the establishment of the new loan have? There are some: (1) Our country's monetary system will be more stable, and the future of the war of resistance will be more hopeful; (2) British financial, industrial, and commercial enterprises will receive considerable and significant benefits; (3) Japan's new adventurous plans in the Far East will suffer the first major blow; (4) Soviet assistance to China will be greatly facilitated; (5) The aid-China movements in the United States and France may become more active. However, we must still pay attention to: (1) A loan of 5 million is like a drop in the bucket. We must further launch greater British assistance and concerted action by democratic and peaceful countries; (2) The [Japanese]'s efforts to divide and instigate, as well as the rumors that Britain will force mediation of the Sino-Japanese war, and other conspiracies, will inevitably develop accordingly and must be combated urgently; (3) We can only strive for foreign aid under the principle of self-reliance, rather than rely on foreign aid. Self-reliance starts with the mobilization of the national dynamic forces, and striving for greater foreign aid starts with the persistence of national unity and a long-term war of resistance!</p>
<p>Anti-War Tide Spreads in Japan</p>
<p>In contrast to our country's internal political progress and abundant foreign aid, Japan is increasingly trapped in diplomatic isolation and internal chaos. In particular, the impact of the prolonged war has revealed major crises in the domestic financial and economic situation, and the people's lives are becoming increasingly desperate. As a result, the anti-war tide in the country and in the army in China is showing an increasing momentum. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 2nd (from the Central News Agency, same below), "Anti-war sentiment in [Japanese] has spread throughout the country. On the 17th of last month, riots broke out in Kanto Southern Town and Ohtsubo due to intense conscription. Villagers gathered and set fires everywhere, destroying more than 300 households. It was only quelled after a large number of military police suppressed them." Another dispatch from Military Celebration on the 3rd stated, "A foreign dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese anti-war organizations are expanding, and military and police agencies are making every effort to search for them. Their secret activities have become more active. On the 1st of this month, a gunpowder depot in Osaka suddenly exploded. At that time, the fire spread fiercely, and most of the nearby barracks and houses were destroyed. The number of dead, injured, and displaced people was about 20,000 or more, and more than 10,000 military police went to guard and rescue them. After a large number of personnel were dispatched by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for investigation, it was learned that it was caused by arson by anti-war groups." Another Chongqing dispatch on the 7th stated: "A dispatch from Shanghai: Since the [Japanese] army department's [Japanese] army in China has repeatedly experienced internal disputes and anti-war incidents, a large number of personnel have recently been dispatched to various places for supervision. [Japanese] army supervisors Shiraki and Soda in South China arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is said that since landing at Daya Bay until the end of December, there were a total of 27 disputes and anti-war incidents in the [Japanese] army in South China." Also, a dispatch from Tianjin on the 9th stated that at the end of last month, Tianjin military police openly distributed anti-aggression speeches, and six people were shot on the 1st of this month. Statistics show that the military force used by Japan to invade China has accounted for more than 85% of the country's military force, deaths and injuries have reached 700,000, and the war expenses used are about 10 million yen per day. The war expenses for 20 months are approximately equal to all of Japan's property. Now that domestic production has declined, foreign trade has shrunk, military expenses have increased, and the anti-war tide has expanded, it is no wonder.</p>
<p>Exposure of Peace Conspiracy</p>
<p>The voices of "peace" and "mediating the Sino-Japanese War" seem to have risen again these days, and it is obviously the [Japanese] and traitors who are behind it. In fact, we are not opposed to peace. No, all Chinese people sincerely hope for the realization of peace and the coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan. However, since the September 18th Incident, the [Japanese] have attacked our entire nation, revealing their entire pre-determined plan to destroy our nation and conquer the Pacific. Our leader, President Chiang Kai-shek, in view of the fact that compromise, concession, and endurance have reached the final juncture, led the national resistance. Because only resistance can win peace. However, after the launch of the war of resistance, if the [Japanese] have not suffered a fatal blow, have not abandoned their aggressive policies, and have not withdrawn all their troops, then any compromise halfway through is the surrender of our entire nation. But what is the basis for those who are now talking about peace? First, let's look at Japan! On March 8th, a question was raised in the House of Representatives regarding the issue of stationing troops in China. Tsutsumi Yasujiro asked: "Is the scope of troop stationing long-term and quite extensive?" Army Minister Itagaki replied, "Of course, it will be long-term, as has been said repeatedly. The issue of territory must be determined based on the situation at that time." Itagaki also stated: "Maintaining law and order in the occupied areas is the top priority, but Japan's military strength is limited. It is extremely difficult to fully deploy Japanese troops everywhere. Therefore, we have long considered using Chinese troops to help them oppress us." He also stated, "Raise funds locally, use Chinese people to extract Chinese resources, and use Chinese resources to support the Japanese army." However, pro-Japanese traitors say that "Japan is prepared to withdraw its troops and negotiate peace with us"! Moreover, in reality, Japan is intensifying its military operations to attack the Southwest, launching a three-pronged invasion of the Northwest, attacking western Hubei, and frantically bombing Xiangfan and Yichang. A large-scale offensive is being launched. Where is the "peace"? Second, let's look at our country. Heroic bloody battles have been fought for 20 months, and the sacrifices cannot be made in vain. How can the great achievements in the war of resistance be abandoned? Now, apart from a few national traitors who have been expelled but still advocate peace and pro-Japanese policies, from the highest leader, military and political officials, all armies, all parties, all people, and all sectors of society, there is actually no one who willingly becomes a slave and advocates peace and surrender to Japan. Third, internationally, the Soviet Union has already provided and is continuing to provide us with great spiritual and military assistance. Britain has repeatedly loaned large sums of money to us, and the United States and France are also doing the same. It can be seen that the international community has also deeply recognized that China's war of resistance is not only for self-liberation but also to maintain world peace. To preserve their interests in the Far East and world peace, all countries have no choice but to support China's war of resistance to the end. From this, it can be seen that at this time when the situation of [Japanese] superiority and our inferiority is undergoing drastic changes, the [Japanese]'s propaganda of "peace" is actually aimed at relaxing our war of resistance, concealing its new offensive, and facilitating its rapid subjugation of our country! And pro-Japanese [women] are actually helping the [Japanese] to carry out their schemes, advocating "actively seeking peace" and "saving the country by opposing communism and being pro-Japanese," and selectively quoting statements from a small number of political figures and newspapers, spreading rumors and attempting to undermine our united front against Japan and undermine the credibility of our government among the people and internationally in order to help the [Japanese]'s new offensive. We must be especially vigilant!</p>
<p>Future of the Spanish War</p>
<p>After the British and French governments recognized the Spanish rebel Franco's government, the armies and people of the Spanish Democratic Republic have suffered even greater oppression and difficulties, which we cannot ignore. However, recently, British and French news agencies, based on telegrams issued by the Spanish rebels, have repeatedly stated that "the Spanish Republican Army is preparing to surrender" and that "peace negotiations are underway," believing that the Spanish war situation is about to end. But in fact, (1) the resistance of the Spanish people under the leadership of the Republican government is against the fascist rebels directed by foreign aggressors and seeks the freedom of the entire nation and people. Even if the rebels currently have an advantage, if the people do not have freedom, the war of resistance will never stop; (2) although the Republican Army is extremely difficult, it still has a basis for resistance. The main thing is that it possesses a central area accounting for a quarter of the country, more than 9 million loyal people, 500,000 elite troops, revolutionary parties, and the leadership of the People's Front with more than 30 months of struggle experience; (3) international sympathy and assistance continue to be enthusiastic, especially the Soviet Union, which has, is now, and will continue to overcome greater difficulties to provide the Spanish people with all kinds of assistance. We should understand that the struggle of all the Spanish people today is on the one hand, a struggle against domestic reactionaries, defending democracy and freedom, and striving for social liberation, and on the other hand, resisting German and Italian aggressors, striving for national liberation, and defending European and world peace. We not only cannot ignore its significance in assisting our country's war of resistance but must also provide it with spiritual and material support!</p>

<p>Soviet All-Union Communist Party Congress</p>
<p>The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was opened in Moscow on March 10th. At a time when the whole world is trapped in the flames of a war of re-division of the world launched by the fascists, and the democratic and peaceful countries are terrified and shocked, the plenary session of the only leading party in this country, which is regarded as the "mainstay of world peace," naturally easily attracts special attention from all sides. A Haipeng News Agency dispatch from Moscow on the 9th even reported that "The Executive Committee of the All-Union Communist Party is scheduled to hold a special meeting on the 15th of this month, at which it will discuss general world political issues, with special emphasis on the current situation in Europe. It is widely believed that the Spanish issue will be the focus of discussion." In this area where news about the Soviet Union is particularly unavailable, it is naturally impossible to speculate. In fact, the focus of discussion at this All-Union Communist Party Congress is on domestic issues. The main agenda items are the third five-year plan for developing the Soviet national economy and the revision of the All-Union Communist Party Constitution. The former seeks to improve the economic and cultural development of the Soviet state and people, so that it can move from a socialist society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to a communist society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." The latter seeks to grant workers, peasants, and intellectuals broad and equal democratic rights based on the new socialist constitution. Both of these will simultaneously increase the strength of the Soviet people and the country, so that it can be unafraid of the encirclement and attack of new fascist aggressors. As for foreign affairs, the principles of "not threatening others and not being threatened by others" and "maintaining world peace and supporting national independence" will not change. Assistance to the struggle for the independence and liberation of the people and world peace will remain unchanged in the past, present, and future, and will be the same for Spain and China. Although there will be differences in the implementation steps due to various special conditions.</p>
<p>Japan Yields to Soviet Union Again</p>
<p>The [Japanese]-Soviet fishing zone dispute can be said to have reached its peak this week, because the old fishing agreement has expired, and the Soviet Union scheduled to auction off fishing grounds on March 15th. Japan stated: Because the Soviet Union did not agree to open up the fishing zones, it would use armed force to protect fishermen fishing in the Soviet fishing zones. The Soviet Union stated: If the [Japanese] side violates the agreement and enters the Soviet fishing zones, the Soviet Union, for the dignity of the treaty's sovereignty, will definitely punish it. According to telegrams these days, the Soviet Union is actively strengthening its Far East army's defense capabilities and adding two new cutting-edge warships to reinforce Vladivostok, expressing its determination to use armed force to protect fishing. Although Japan has been reckless in the past, saying things like "not hesitating to fight the Soviet Union," its purpose was originally to create a "national crisis" to ease domestic anti-war sentiment, intensify the exploitation of the people's blood and sweat to help its military operations against China, and also attempt to divert international attention and smoothly implement its southwestern strategy and threaten the southward policies of Britain and France. Moreover, since the defeat at Zhanggufeng, it has long tasted the taste of the Red Army's iron fist! How dare it directly attack the Soviet Union at this time! Now the [Japanese] have automatically lost heart to the Soviet Union. The Japanese Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, Navy Minister, and Finance Minister decided at a meeting on the 7th to ease tensions with the Soviet Union and announced that Japan would not give up negotiations and would negotiate until the last minute. It automatically cancelled the previous declaration to use armed force to protect fishing before March 15th. From this, we can see the [Japanese]'s embarrassment, and at the same time, we can see the [Japanese]'s determination to focus on attacking China and the Southwest today! This is something we cannot fail to be vigilant about.</p>
<h3>Communications from Guerrilla Areas: War Opportunities in Pudong are Imminent; [Japanese] Army Fortifications in Xinchang are Completely Destroyed; Various Guerrilla Detachments Have Successfully Contacted Each Other</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Communication] After suffering repeated defeats, the [Japanese] army in Pudong has dispatched two or three planes from time to time to fly for intimidation and reconnaissance, especially after the tragic defeat in the Battle of Xinchang Town on the sixth day of the first lunar month. The guerrillas also suffered casualties. Although the Japanese army stubbornly resisted on the Wang surname watchtower and set up an electric fence, it was finally destroyed by the guerrillas. Afterwards, the Japanese army targeted Datuan Town in Nanhui County. The various battalion commanders of the guerrillas are now planning to fully drive out the remaining Japanese troops who invaded the border of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties. However, at the time of the general offensive, the Japanese army, after being defeated, will obviously resort to unscrupulous means to poison the rear, and even harm non-combatant people on the pretext of the county government's relationship. Therefore, it was decided to move the Nanhui County Government to an unknown place that outsiders cannot reach. The various departments have been completely moved the day before yesterday, and the Chuansha County Government has also moved away from Heqing Town, so that the traitors cannot guide and the Japanese aircraft cannot use their tricks. It is now heard that the guerrilla contact has been successful in the Pudong area, and the great war will obviously begin at the edge of the Lunar New Year festival.</p>
<p>Sudden Tension on the Shangnan Line</p>
<p>The situation is tense in the area along the Shangnan Railway in Pudong. The [Japanese] army is frequently mobilized. In the past few days, several batches of troops have been dispatched, about three or four hundred people, most of whom were transferred to the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to fight, and a few were added to the defense of the western suburbs, so the defense is empty. At about 4 pm the day before yesterday, more than 100 army troops were transferred back from the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, landed at Nanmatou, and rushed to Zhoupu Town, the end point of Shangpulu, to station. When the Japanese troops landed, the area around Nanmatou was temporarily under martial law for half an hour. It is also learned that the Shangnan Railway was secretly sabotaged by the Chinese army, and the tracks were only repaired until the afternoon of the 28th. The Shangnan passenger car has resumed traffic the day before yesterday, but the [Japanese] army is searching civilian houses in groups in the Dongsanlintang area, among which there are puppet cars, which are extremely disturbing to the local villagers.</p>
<p>Guerrillas Hold Important Meeting</p>
<p>After the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha in Pudong were controlled by our guerrillas, the Japanese puppet forces could no longer operate. They are building fortresses at key locations, stationing troops to guard them, in order to prevent our guerrillas from attacking. In order to coordinate the second phase of the War of Resistance, our guerrillas lurking in various places held an important meeting at the Tai-Japanese Overseas Chinese Association in Fengxian County last month. The leaders of the various guerrillas who participated this time included Ding Xueshan, Li Zhiming, Yu Taosheng, Kuang Xingyan, Zhang Huifang, and Zhang Miaogen, dozens of people. Decisions were made on several major issues, including: 1. Organizing the Fengxian, Nanhui, Minghang, Shanghai, Jinshan, Qingpu, Baoshan, Jiading eight county guerrillas' general headquarters, with Ding Xueshan, Li Zhiming, and Gan Taosheng serving as the general and deputy commanders; 2. Assembling the troops and scheduling the general attack on the Japanese army on a set date; 3. Organizing a public intelligence team to penetrate the [Japanese] army's defense area and investigate the movements of the Japanese army; 4. Mobilizing the people of the eight counties to use local armed forces to protect the land of China; 5. Abolishing harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies to ease the difficulties of merchants; 6. Organizing a mobile troupe to perform anti-Japanese dramas; 7. Requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Government to select capable personnel to go to the countryside to organize county governments, etc., seven items. The leaders of the various guerrillas have all returned to their defense areas after the meeting.</p>

<h3>British New Loan to China Sparks Panic in Japanese Authorities; Cabinet, Foreign Ministry, and Parliament Hold Emergency Meetings; Craigie Visits Sawada to Explain Loan Motives</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dianqing, 9th] Tokyo News: According to well-informed sources, Japan is about to lodge a protest with the British government regarding the British loan to China, which they suspect is intended to strengthen its exchange equalization fund. As a retaliatory measure, Japan will strengthen its monetary policy towards China and southern China.

<h3>Japanese Currency Policy Fails in North China; North China Public Maintains Strong Faith in Legal Tender (Part 1); Confession of Japanese National Mitsudo Chuzo</h3>
<p>The March issue of "Modern Japan" published an article by Mitsudo Chuzo discussing the currency situation in the Japanese-occupied areas of our country and Japan's currency operations. The article provides startling information, such as that, with the exception of a small amount of 13 million yuan, the counterfeit banknotes issued in Beiping that circulated in North China were used to pay for Japanese military expenses, rather than being issued solely to recover Chinese legal tender. The article also states that Japanese "military scrip" was also used to pay for military expenses and to exchange for legal tender, and then to use the legal tender to purchase Chinese goods that could not be obtained with Japanese currency or counterfeit currency. Mitsudo clearly stated that the counterfeit currency was not worth the officially set price (i.e., one shilling and two pence, the same as the Japanese yen). Mitsudo's article clearly shows that he believes that the Japanese currency experiment in North China has completely failed. Later, he confirmed the stability of our country's legal tender and the trust of the North China public in legal tender. His arguments are worth considering. The following is a section-by-section translation of the article:</p>
<p>Beginning of the War</p>
<p>No one expected its scale to develop to the enormous scale it is now, so it was decided to use banknotes from the Yokohama Specie Bank to pay for military expenses. However, the expansion of the war zone was unexpected, making it impossible to continue to use these banknotes. Otherwise, Japanese banknotes would bear an unwanted heavy burden, as will be described below. This situation led to the establishment of a new bank to issue banknotes in North China. Initially, it was planned to organize a new bank with the Hebei Provincial Bank as its core, but it was immediately recognized that these compensatory plans were all inappropriate. The first step was to adjust the banknotes previously issued by various banks in North China, such as the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Jidong Bank, in order to place the monetary system on a solid and unified foundation. Thus, the proposed</p>
<p>Issuance of Banknotes</p>
<p>The bank was established, named the "North China United Reserve Bank," with an approved capital of 50 million Japanese yen. Half of the capital was fully paid, with 12.5 million yuan paid by the "Provisional Government." The Chinese banks in North China, such as the Hebei Provincial Bank, the Jidong Bank, the Jianye Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, contributed 12.5 million yuan, and Japanese banks also provided credit loans of 100 million Japanese yen. The new bank's resources were greatly enhanced, but the silver held by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications as reserves for the new bank was stored in the British and French concessions. The two concessions refused to hand it over, which caused difficulties. This silver accounted for a portion of the "United Reserve Bank's" 58 million yuan silver reserve.</p>
<p>Silver Shelved</p>
<p>Because the silver was intended to be used as the largest support for the United Reserve Bank, its seizure hindered the smooth circulation of United Reserve banknotes. One obstacle the bank faced was the inability to freely sell foreign exchange, because the United Reserve Bank still did not have sufficient foreign currency deposits. Its banknotes were now on par with Japanese banknotes. In order to make its banknotes the only banknotes circulating in its jurisdiction, the "North China Provisional Government" decided to withdraw the old currencies issued by the various North China banks that had branches in Beiping and Tianjin. Within a one-year period starting on March 10, 1938, old currencies could be exchanged for United Reserve banknotes at par. Banknotes issued by Chinese banks with headquarters in Shanghai were</p>
<p>Prohibited from Circulation</p>
<p>It is estimated that there were 430 to 450 million yuan of old currency circulating in North China, most of which were banknotes from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. In the nine months from March 10, 1937, the United Reserve Bank had recovered no more than 13 million yuan of old currency. The circulation of United Reserve banknotes was approximately 150 million yuan, most of which was issued to pay for military expenses. The United Reserve Bank followed the example of the Central Bank of Manchuria and adopted the method of the Central Bank to solve the same problem of dealing with old currency. When the Central Bank was established, there were approximately 140 million yuan of old currency circulating in Manchuria, 99% of which were</p>
<p>Recovered Within Two and a Half Years</p>
<p>However, the situation in North China was very different from the situation in Manchuria when the Central Bank was established. The existence of foreign concessions was the biggest obstacle, because foreign banks not only did not cooperate with the work of the United Reserve Bank, but also hindered it. The North China public trusted old currency more than new currency. Because the old currency in Manchuria was low in value and lacked credibility, the Central Bank of Manchuria was able to sell foreign exchange on demand at the beginning of its operation, while the United Reserve Bank could not do so. Another important obstacle was the business situation, because North China, unlike Manchuria, had a large trade surplus, except for trade with Mongolia and Tibet. All of these situations</p>
<p>Made it Difficult to Obtain Foreign Currency</p>
<p>The progress was very slow. United Reserve banknotes, although not worth one shilling and two pence, were on par with Japanese banknotes. Because of this fact, the situation continued to worsen. Merchants were soon encouraged to buy United Reserve banknotes with old currency and to use United Reserve banknotes to pay for imported Japanese goods. This method ultimately sacrificed Japanese banknotes and caused equal losses to Japanese banks. The fact that foreign banks refused to recognize the new currency further hindered the United Reserve Bank's foreign exchange situation. According to what I have heard, the intention of foreign banks seems to be that they cannot accept inconvertible currency.</p>

<h3>Tense Situation in Tianjin; British and American Navies on High Alert; Japanese Build Wooden Bridge to Cut Off Concession Traffic</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 10th] The British Navy patrolled the Bund outside the British Concession all day today. Although the British Navy was not on special alert, it canceled tonight's regular leave for the troops. At the same time, the British and French consuls jointly issued a statement saying, "Due to environmental needs, the area for inspecting pedestrians has been expanded." However, the nature of this move was not specified.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 10th] The Japanese army has recently built a wooden bridge on the river bordering the Italian and Japanese concessions. It is said to be very strong and can be used for the passage of trucks and armored vehicles. It is rumored that this facility was approved by Rome in advance. At the same time, due to the Japanese army's transportation of a large number of bridge-building materials, it is rumored again that the Japanese army will build another bridge connecting the old German and Russian concessions, thereby cutting off traffic to the British and French concessions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tianjin Foreign News: The British Concession authorities published a report in the Tianjin Times today, stating that in order to maintain law and order within the British Concession, the British authorities will adopt certain control measures for the residents of the concession. The French Consul General in Tianjin also issued a similar announcement on the same day. Since last night, British troops have been armed and deployed on various streets in the British Concession, and armed French troops are also patrolling in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Guanzhong; Some Residents of Xi'an Evacuate</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 10th] Because Xi'an is a non-armed defensive city, the Chinese authorities, in view of the Japanese army's continuous devastation in recent days, ordered the evacuation of some residents. Tens of thousands of people have been retreating westward in recent days. At the same time, various government agencies are stepping up air defense equipment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 9th] Eighteen Japanese aircraft disturbed various parts of Shaanxi Province in four sorties on the 9th. Eleven aircraft flew to Jian, Siyuan, Jingyang, and Dali to reconnoiter. Seven aircraft arrived in Weinan at 11:35 a.m., wantonly bombing the county seat and Xiguan, dropping more than 50 bombs, killing and injuring more than a dozen people, and destroying more than 40 houses. They also dropped several incendiary bombs in Xiguan, causing fires in three places, resulting in heavy losses for civilians.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 10th] A Japanese military spokesman here said that many Japanese army aircraft bombed Chinese positions along the Longhai Railway on Thursday.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The Japan Times, which is close to the Japanese government, commented on the bombing of highways and other nearby cities between Xi'an and Lanzhou by Japanese Air Force aircraft, saying that the Japanese side will continue to carry out air raids to carry out military attempts to "manage" the northwest and to "control" the entire Longhai Railway.</p>
<h3>American Church in Yichang Bombed; US Consul Protests to Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hankou, 10th] The American Consul General here visited the Japanese Consul this morning to strongly protest the Japanese aircraft's bombing of American church property in Yichang, and stated that in June of last year, the American Consul, at the request of the Japanese, had reported the locations of American properties to the Japanese side, questioning why Japan would deliberately destroy them again.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Hankou Foreign News: The American Consulate in Hankou protested to the Japanese side because the St. 公会 Church was affected when Japanese aircraft bombed Yichang twice on the 8th. According to reports, during the first bombing, four bombs were dropped on the St. 公会 football field, which originally had an American flag. The second time, seven bombs were dropped nearby, completely destroying the Catholic Church adjacent to the St. 公会 Church and three houses next to the church.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 10th] It has been learned that during the recent Japanese bombing of Yichang, seventeen bombs were dropped around an American church in the area, one building was completely destroyed, and three other buildings, including the church, were damaged. All American church personnel were unharmed. At the time, the American flag was hung on the buildings, but the Japanese aircraft ignored it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hankou, 9th] The Japanese army bombed Yichang fiercely on Wednesday, and the American church was also destroyed. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Officials from the American Consulate notified the Japanese side of the location of the American property in July of last year, and a flag 22 feet high was hung, but the Japanese side ignored it and has now protested to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>North China Bans Legal Tender; Japanese Have No Remedy in Most Areas</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beiping, 10th] The order of the puppet provisional government prohibiting the people of North China from using Chinese legal tender was originally scheduled to take effect tomorrow, but today the puppet government suddenly announced a change of policy, saying that North China would be divided into two zones. One zone is the "United Reserve Bank Currency Zone," containing eleven cities and towns in Wanlu Jinyu, such as Beixiao, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai. Within this zone, people are not allowed to use Chinese legal tender, and violators will have their money confiscated and fined. The other zone is called the "Bandit Zone," because the puppet government has no ability to interfere in this area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 10th] The foreign exchange office of the puppet United Reserve Bank has been scheduled to be established separately in Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, with Zheng Ji, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Zhang serving as directors of the three places of Pingjin and Qing. Banknotes from the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Jitong Bank will still be used to purchase foreign exchange, but cannot be circulated in the market. In addition, Fang, the Deputy Minister of Education of the puppet government, is now appointed as Acting Minister of Education.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Attack Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] Japanese newspapers today have criticized Britain's loan to China. The newspapers' comments are obviously instructed by the authorities. Hochi Shimbun advocates that the Japanese government should lodge a serious protest against the British side for this "unfriendly action," and at the same time take active countermeasures. If Britain continues to take this "unfriendly action," Japan will take retaliatory actions against British interests in China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] Nichi Nichi Shimbun said, "Britain's maintenance of Chinese legal tender can be called participation in China's economic guerrilla warfare. Japan is not lacking in countermeasures. For example, the current issue of navigation on the Yangtze River can be delayed indefinitely."</p>
<h3>British Opinion Supports Loans to Aid China; Newspapers Express Satisfaction; Hope for Cooperation Between the US and France</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] London newspapers have published the news of Britain's loan to China to strengthen its exchange equalization fund in a prominent position. The newspapers have unanimously expressed satisfaction with this. Opinion and financial circles here believe that the result of Britain's loan to China will make it impossible for Japan to implement its attempt to prohibit the use of legal tender in North China. The military pay for the Chinese army in North China is directly arranged by the Chinese National Government. Although the region is vast and transportation is difficult, the Chinese government is still able to send military pay to various parts of North China on schedule. Therefore, increasing the exchange equalization fund is also supporting the legal tender in North China on the side. According to authoritative sources, in the past nine months, the use of China's original exchange equalization fund has actually had a surplus, so this new fund should not be regarded as supporting China's monetary system to avoid falling. The authorities notified the major countries before announcing it to the House of Commons. It is reported that in the British note to Japan, the point that Japan recently said "also wants to consolidate China's monetary system" was raised. The Financial Times stated that countries with interests in China should cooperate to avoid the risk of the Chinese trading market losing its current situation. Business circles in the United States and France have also established close contacts with each other. London's business community is paying close attention to all of these points. The Chinese section of the London Chamber of Commerce held a meeting here this Monday, and the Paris Chamber of Commerce also sent representatives to participate. The meeting discussed the issue of mutual protection of their commercial interests. In general, people have expressed support for the proposal to provide financial assistance to the Chinese government to prevent Japanese troops from invading China again.</p>
<h3>Refuting Rumors!</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei's advocacy of peace talks has long been spurned by the people of the whole country. Besides the Wang faction's mouthpiece, the ×× Daily in Hong Kong, no other newspaper has failed to sternly denounce him. As for Shanghai, it was the Shen Bao that first published the full text of Mr. Wang's original telegram advocating peace and vehemently criticized it. The facts are clear, and it is naturally unacceptable for those who are accustomed to spreading rumors to maliciously slander!</p>
<p>Who would have known that on the eighth and ninth of this month, the ×× Daily would repeatedly spread rumors and falsely accuse the Shanghai Shen Bao of publishing pro-peace remarks, reversing right and wrong, and confusing black and white. It is extremely despicable and utterly shameless! The newspaper falsely claimed that the Shanghai Shen Bao's editorial on March 1st, which reported on Japan's "Kita Peace Plan," was evidence of the Shen Bao advocating for peace. In fact, the article stated: "China's war of resistance will soon reach its twentieth month... and only strives for final victory. With stubborn enemies in front, there is no turning back. Rather endure all hardships than seek temporary peace." Furthermore, it stated: "Therefore, the reporter deeply sighed that Mr. Kita, who is known as an authority among the Japanese 'China experts', his backwardness of thought, his alienation from the Chinese situation, and especially his lack of understanding of the general ideas of the Chinese people in recent years, are so profound. Therefore, it is even more firmly believed that Japan will not repent until it is utterly defeated and falls into an irrecoverable situation. There is no hope for a compromise to resolve the war and establish peace in the Far East. Therefore, it is even more boldly asserted that China's attainment of final victory through a protracted war of resistance is the most convenient way to resolve the war and establish peace in the Far East. There is no other shortcut." With such a "categorical" anti-Japanese stance, the ×× Daily actually dared to falsely claim with large headlines that "The Shanghai Shen Bao Published Pro-Peace Remarks," hoping to justify itself by implicating the Shanghai Shen Bao and attempting to deceive the people of the whole country. Therefore, we must directly denounce it as extremely despicable and utterly shameless!</p>
<p>What handle does the ×× Daily think it has on the Shanghai Shen Bao? It's truly laughable! It turns out that the so-called Kita's Peace Plan included a clause stating that "Japan would withdraw its troops from central and southern China but continue to station troops in North China." The Shanghai Shen Bao's March 1st editorial first exposed Kita's "狰狞面目" (狰狞面目 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "ferocious face") and his "ambitions" and "conspiracies." It then took a step back and considered Kita's own position, suggesting that if he wanted to show his sincerity in proposing this condition, he should first implement the troop withdrawal clause before discussing anything else, or else he would not be qualified to propose any conditions. The original text did not contain a single word implying that Japan could station troops in North China after withdrawing its troops from central and southern China. Moreover, any reader who read the entire article would never have doubted that the Shanghai Shen Bao, which strongly advocated for "protracted war of resistance" to seek "final victory," would abandon its established position and echo Mr. Wang Jingwei's fallacious view of allowing Japan to station troops in specific locations in North China. The ×× Daily stubbornly insisted that the Shanghai Shen Bao advocated for conditional peace and falsely claimed that the Shanghai Shen Bao indicated that Japan could station troops in North China. Such despicable tactics are simply "含血喷人" (含血喷人 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "maliciously slandering") and cannot even be described as "断章取义" (断章取义 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "taking things out of context").</p>
<p>As for the ×× Daily's claim that "the chief editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao, Mr. Pan Gongbi, is a special envoy of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai... he has a more substantial background," that is "白日见鬼" (白日见鬼 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "utter nonsense") and "胡说八道" (胡说八道 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "pure fabrication")—the chief editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao is not Mr. Pan Gongbi, and since the Shanghai Shen Bao resumed publication last year, all editorials have been published without the author's signature. The ×× Daily's malicious rumors provide yet another irrefutable proof of its dishonesty!</p>
<p>We know very well that the ridiculous remarks of the ×× Daily have long been despised by readers in Hong Kong. However, this time it dares to "言之凿凿" (言之凿凿 is too harsh to translate directly into English, so I will translate the meaning as "make definitive statements") and maliciously slander the Shanghai Shen Bao. Moreover, the original text of the Shanghai Shen Bao's editorial on March 1st may not be available to all readers in Hong Kong. To avoid causing possible misunderstandings among readers, we specially reprint the entire article below on behalf of the Shanghai Shen Bao, so that readers can understand the truth of the matter and prevent the despicable and shameless ×× Daily from using its tricks.</p>
<p>The So-Called Japanese "Kita Peace" Plan</p>
<p>What gives people the strongest stimulation is, in times of peace, nothing is more significant than the bloody sword, and in times of war, nothing is more significant than rumors of peace. This is human nature, which cannot be concealed, and it is also a matter of course, which need not be avoided. China's war of resistance against Japan will soon reach its twentieth month. Although the government and the people are working hard and morale is high, mindful of the survival of the nation, we only strive for final victory. With stubborn enemies in front, there is no turning back. Rather endure all hardships than seek temporary peace. However, every time we hear about peace talks, we want to investigate their origin, distinguish their truthfulness, examine their content, and study their consequences. This is also a constant human sentiment and a matter of course, because one cannot help oneself. For example, the Chongqing telegram of the Associated Press reported the other day, and the London telegram of the German Hai Tong News Agency reported yesterday, both concerning peace talks. Regardless of the psychology of the parties involved, it can be asserted that readers will not dismiss them lightly.</p>
<p>The two telegrams differ in their origin and their main points. However, both use the so-called peace plan of Japanese Major General Kita as the only source of information. The Chongqing telegram refutes it, while the British telegram focuses on interpretation. This reporter is ignorant and has not had the opportunity to see the original version of the Kita plan. However, based on the Chongqing and British telegrams, we can get a glimpse of the content of the plan, which has six points: first, Japan expresses respect for the Three Principles of the People as the basis for Sino-Japanese peace; second, the peace process will no longer use the puppet organization in Peiping as a puppet, but China and Japan will conduct face-to-face negotiations; third, the Chinese government after peace will still be called the "Kuomintang Government," with Wang Jingwei as the chairman; fourth, there will be no more "overthrowing" and "toppling" of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but he will be invited to participate in the so-called "Kuomintang Government" and hold prominent positions; fifth, if the National Government agrees to these conditions, Japan will withdraw its troops from central and southern China, but continue to station troops in North China; sixth, Japan will cooperate with foreign countries that mediate peace talks to develop the economy of North China. According to the Chongqing telegram, a certain official in Chongqing denounced the Kita plan's invitation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as an absolute insult and exposed the Japanese people's so-called Kuomintang and so-called Three Principles of the People as another trick to borrow names to deceive people and make the Party and the country exist in name only. Furthermore, it revealed that this is the same as the rumors that have been circulating for months that the Japanese are plotting to organize a so-called "New Kuomintang." Such a view and refutation by a certain official is almost universally felt.</p>
<p>After analyzing the two telegrams, the reporter learned that what Mr. Kita and his like hope for is the above six points. Furthermore, the reporter feels that Mr. Kita's military is more superior to Konoe and those he represents, because Konoe and those he represents are deceiving their own people and numbing themselves, thinking that the military aggression has been quite successful and that China is about to submit. They can use the prestige of a false victory to cover up the situation of impending defeat and expect China to stop resisting and accept the conditions for national subjugation. Mr. Kita's attitude is slightly different. He knows that the war cannot be won and that the Three Principles of the People and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek are factors for stabilizing China. Therefore, he makes an attempt to steal the sky and replace the sun, thinking that if he slightly modifies his ferocious face, his ambitions may be realized, his conspiracies may be sold, and China may be fooled. However, it is a mistake. Therefore, the reporter deeply sighed that Mr. Kita, who is known as an authority among the Japanese "China experts," his backwardness of thought, his alienation from the Chinese situation, and especially his lack of understanding of the general ideas of the Chinese people in recent years, are so profound. Therefore, it is even more firmly believed that Japan will not repent until it is utterly defeated and falls into an irrecoverable situation. There is no hope for a compromise to resolve the war and establish peace in the Far East. Therefore, it is even more boldly asserted that China's attainment of final victory through a protracted war of resistance is the most convenient way to resolve the war and establish peace in the Far East. There is no other shortcut.</p>
<p>In fact, the Kita plan is either harboring malicious intentions and vainly hoping to fool China, or Mr. Kita's understanding is insufficient. Judging from his intentions, he probably thinks that the Chinese people only care about the surface of the Three Principles of the People, the central government, and national sovereignty, and that they can be manipulated and replaced in essence. He probably thinks that the Chinese people only respect Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's position and are not loyal, passionate, supportive, and loving of him as their sole leader. He probably thinks that the people who have been praised by the Chinese people in the past, no matter how confused their recent situation or how wrong their behavior, can still be managed to make the Chinese people blindly praise them again. He probably thinks that the leader who is supported and loved by the Chinese people is interested in money and fame and can be lured by the position of "Eastern goods." If he does not have such an insufficient understanding, how could he have such a plan for the peace he hopes for?</p>
<p>Of course, the Japanese side's ideas cannot be completely the same as China's. Therefore, conditions that are considered unacceptable by the Chinese side may have been presented with sincerity by the Japanese side, who already feels unable to continue the war and unable to win. As for what Mr. Kita said, even if he is said to have insufficient understanding, how can we be sure that he is not very sincere? This is for future determination, but it is not enough to serve as proof. If there is one, it is only to withdraw troops from central and southern China first, then talk about principles, and then talk about conditions.</p>

<h3>British Air Minister Presents Air Force Budget, Twelve Times Higher Than Five Years Ago, London Balloon Network Ready for Completion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] British Air Minister Wood, when presenting the £200.5 million Air Force budget in the House of Commons today, used charts to illustrate the progress of the British Air Force, saying that the current number is twelve times higher than any year between 1929 and 1934. This year's Air Force budget has increased by £74 million, which is equivalent to the entire national defense budget of 1913. The largest items are aircraft and balloons, totaling £93 million. Thirty-five Women's Auxiliary Air Force units are being organized. It is expected that the British Air Force plans to add another 20,000 people this year, bringing the total to 102,000. There has been significant progress in the manufacture of engines and the expansion of the balloon obstacle network. Last June, the government recruited 31,600 pilots, reconnaissance personnel, etc., with excellent results. The predetermined number was exceeded last week, and the quality was excellent. Mr. Wood also announced that the above Air Force budget includes the Air Reserve and Supplementary Force. There are currently 33 reserve units in rural areas, and it is planned to establish 20 more next year. The Ministry of Aviation has decided to expand reserve flight training overseas and hopes that branches will also be established in Malaya, Hong Kong, East Africa, etc., so that local citizens can participate in the volunteer reserve force. Mr. Wood then mentioned the balloon obstacle network, saying that this obstacle network is ready in London and can be used when necessary. It is expected that the installation of this obstacle network will be completed throughout the country by the end of this year. There are 1,400 civil aviation personnel with flight licenses, and another 3,800 are in training. He also said that the standard of pilots has been raised. By April 1st of this year, the Imperial Headquarters will have 1,750 first-line aircraft. There are currently 30 air force units stationed overseas, and 7 more are being added according to plan, to reach the number of 500 first-line aircraft overseas. Mr. Wood also mentioned new aircraft, saying that Britain's bombers and fighters are the best in the world. He said, "We have not dared to abandon our traditional concept that counter-attack is the essence of war. A strong offensive is not only the most effective way to stop the opponent's attack, but also an indispensable element of any perfect air defense system. Recent developments have reduced the supreme concept of offense and increased the defensive power of the air force. However, this does not mean that we only rely on warplanes and ground defenses for air defense. There are currently eleven aircraft manufacturing plants proceeding under the 'shelter' plan." Mr. Wood then reported on the progress of the aircraft production organization, saying that he has ordered three or four factories to form a group. The government orders a certain type of aircraft, which is then divided and cooperated by the factories in the group. In this way, large-scale plans and orders can be carried out conveniently. Once a war occurs, the manufacturing plants will not be disrupted, resulting in the inability to manufacture that type of aircraft, and the design of the aircraft can also be reduced. Aircraft production is currently progressing rapidly. Britain's daily aircraft manufacturing reaches £250,000, and this number will increase further. Mr. Wood concluded by saying that last November, he estimated that next year's aircraft production would be four times higher than in 1938. This increase is expected to be achieved by the end of this year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] Germany has a rather critical comment on British Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha's speech yesterday, saying that Germany is less concerned with the achievements of British military expansion and more concerned with the psychology expressed in his speech. Germany has no intention of invading France, and France has no intention of invading Germany, but it is strange that the British Secretary of State for War announced that he was preparing to transfer 19 divisions to France.</p>

<h3>Franco Blockades Haikou: Britain States Its Position, Sends Cruisers to Escort Merchant Ships, Resolves to Resist Interference Beyond Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>[Reuter's, London, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax, in yesterday's House of Lords debate on the Spanish question, explained the British government's attitude towards General Franco's blockade of Haikou. Reportedly, the original text of Franco's announcement of the blockade did not indicate any intention to interfere with ships beyond territorial waters. The British government also believes that Franco has no intention of taking such action. What the Foreign Secretary wants to make clear is that if Franco intends to take any action beyond territorial waters, the British government will be forced to resist such action, as in the past. Furthermore, the government has fully stated that if British merchant ships are sunk by Franco's aircraft within territorial waters, the government will consider it a serious incident, especially if adequate warning is not given beforehand and sufficient steps are not taken to protect the safety of the crew. British warships have received government instructions to provide full protection to merchant ships under attack and to retaliate against submarines that take unjustifiable action.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] According to a British naval radio station in Gibraltar this morning, five British cruisers, ordered to return to the port of Gibraltar after participating in Atlantic naval exercises, arrived on Tuesday evening.

<p>[Reuter's, Madrid, 9th] A large squadron of aircraft, under the command of General Michaya's National Defense Council, continuously bombed the rebels in the city today. Madrid Radio broadcast that mechanized units were rapidly advancing towards Attaris to quell the rebellion. The rebels' resistance was minimal, and due to the activity of our tank units, they were clearly unable to withstand it. The trenches along Madrid were all in the hands of the National Defense Council's troops, and it is believed that the situation will soon be restored. When the rebels' headquarters surrendered tonight, 1,400 communists were arrested.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th] News from Madrid claims that the communist headquarters surrendered to Prime Minister Michaya this evening. Initially, Colonel Walter (formerly a communist) volunteered to mediate but failed. Until 8:00 AM today, government troops resumed their attack, with heavy artillery and machine-gun fire.

<h3>Britain Recruits Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] Yesterday, Labor Minister Brownlow declared in the House of Commons that 480,000 people have registered for the volunteer corps so far.

<h3>Japan Plans to Expand Aviation Activities in China: "Transportation Company" Proposal to be Discussed in Parliament</h3>
<p>[Reuter's, Tokyo Correspondence] The Japanese parliament will soon discuss a "Japan Aviation Transportation Company" proposal. The purpose of the proposal is to encourage Japanese civil aircraft activities in Japan, Manchuria, Mongolia, and China, and to provide financial assistance. The proposal states that the main task of the "Japan Aviation Transportation Company" is to promote aviation activities in Japan, Manchuria, Mongolia, and China, and to provide financial assistance to other aviation businesses. The company's capital will be 100 million yen (6 million pounds), of which 37.25 million yen (2.2 million pounds) will be invested by the government. The directors will be appointed by the government.

His recent speech in Shanghai has attracted significant attention from all parties.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>War Clouds Over Southern Guangdong</h3>
<p>Recently, the situation in the war of resistance has gradually become tense, especially in central and southern China. However, although the ambitions of the × in central China are great, their strength is insufficient. With our strong military force using new tactics to counterattack, the situation is expected to be safe. In the southern Guangdong area, since the × army invaded Guangzhou and then landed on Hainan Island, the situation has become serious. It has recently been reported that the × army held an important meeting, indicating even greater ambitions for the southwest. In recent days, the × army has concentrated more than 30 warships and transport ships on Hainan Island, while troops have also been concentrated in Hainan and Weizhou, preparing to land on the Leizhou Peninsula. According to a Guangzhou Xunxun report late at night, the × ships are still constantly increasing off the Xuwen coast, and speedboats are sent to carry × soldiers back and forth to reconnoiter, showing signs of attempting to land. Although this action may not be a sign of a large-scale invasion of southern Guangdong and Guangxi, we must be on strict alert. What we should pay particular attention to is that the × are spreading rumors of "peace" at this time, alienating our anti-Japanese unity and weakening our anti-Japanese forces, in an attempt to conceal their new offensive actions. Traitorous newspapers are also exaggerating and confusing people, acting as accomplices for the ×. The press and education circles should first awaken the × hatred of compatriots and give a powerful blow to the ×'s conspiracy.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Scenic Spots in Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>When we read Li Houzhu's poems, such as "The jade railing and carved steps should still be there, but the vermilion faces have changed" and "The old country is unbearable to look back upon in the moonlight," who would not be saddened and tearful? The Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association will hold an "Exhibition of Scenic Spots in Occupied Areas" in Hong Kong starting today, and in Kowloon starting on the 17th. The exhibition includes historical sites in more than a dozen regions in northern, central and Guangzhou China. Compatriots who have fled from the north and south occupied areas to Hong Kong, seeing this news or visiting this exhibition, I wonder what they will feel. Perhaps some will resonate with Li Houzhu! However, at this time! There is no need to groan those "when can I return to my beloved hometown" of depressed and disappointed tone, President Chiang Kai-shek is right: "To be born a slave is worse than death!" We don't have to be attached to a broken homeland! We must not dream of surviving under the iron hooves of the ×! We must revitalize the self-esteem and self-confidence that the Chinese nation should have, strengthen unity, and under the leadership of the central government and the supreme leader, fight back to our old home and complete Yue Fei's unfinished ambition, "Wait until we reorganize the old mountains and rivers", and recover our splendid hometown to create a new China!</p>
<h3>Transformation of International Form</h3>
<p>— Uncle</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent of this newspaper in London)</p>
<p>The new international crisis brewing by the world's aggressor nations is gradually showing a tendency to be pushed back head-on. Comparing the situation two months ago with today, the obvious progress is something that anyone can see.</p>
<p>Japan's sudden occupation of Hainan Island at that time, within a day or two, the atmosphere in the UK and France, in fact, showed signs of unusual tension. Many people had doubts: perhaps this is the first powerful step planned by the aggressor nations, then, what follows must be the threatening actions of Germany and Italy. As a result, the issue of recognizing the Spanish rebels immediately showed a sharp turnaround. Many people advocated: Regardless of how Spain's future internal affairs evolve, Britain and France should take the lead and quickly occupy Milia Island to ensure the traffic of Britain and France in the Mediterranean. However, after three to five days, Germany and Italy did not make surprising moves to respond to Japan, so this proposal was abandoned. After another two or three days, everyone had determined that Japan this time was making a profiteering idea of ​​taking advantage of the fire, thinking that the UK and France were trapped by Germany and Italy in the Mediterranean issue and had to submit to it, accepting the blockade of the borders of Myanmar and Annam, and cutting off China's military transport. In fact, this move was not a joint action with Germany and Italy. Instead, it wanted to use its alliance with Germany and Italy to make a thorough betrayal, the price of which was: Britain and France helping it monopolize China or forcing the Chinese government to submit. However, Japan's estimate has completely failed. The evidence is that in the past two or three days, in the week after Japan occupied Hainan Island, the British newspapers suddenly poured out page after page of articles rebuking and warning Japan about this move. Why was everyone silent at the beginning, but now suddenly warning and rebuking Japan for this move? This is worth our attention and reflection!</p>
<p>The reason, of course, lies in the overall international situation. Judging from the speed of military expansion of the four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, everyone agrees that as long as another year or two pass, the power of the three countries of Germany, Japan, and Italy will even more fall behind. At that time, the so-called Germany, Japan, and Italy group will fundamentally lose its threatening effect. Then, it may automatically disintegrate and gradually succumb to international justice and fairness. So, if they want to put forward their ambitions to redistribute the world, they can only do it now. Otherwise, the more the days go by, the more渺茫 the chance of realization will be. Taking the UK's situation as an example, roughly two months ago, everyone was worried about the sudden actions of the aggressor nations at any time and any place. In the past month or so, the worries have been decreasing day by day; what has replaced them is guessing: When and in what way will these three countries prepare to put forward their various plans that create international war? Until recently, even this guess is not often heard. Everyone's unanimous belief is that if Britain, the United States, and France always persist in this way, Germany, Japan, and Italy will never have the courage to pose a total threat to world peace.</p>
<p>So, in the end, the only major key lies in whether Britain, France, and the United States can maintain their attitude; and what is especially important is: In the process of being strong, will the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union always stand on the same front facing the threat of Germany, Italy, and Japan? In other words, will they be defeated one by one?</p>
<p>Roughly in early February, a secret military conference was held in Berchtesgaden, Germany. Those who participated were all the major military and political authorities in Germany, discussing Germany's current major policy. The result was still the same as before, and it was divided into two factions. One faction was the so-called "radical", led by Police Chief Himmler, who strongly advocated that Germany should quickly put forward all its demands. Otherwise, it should propose to Britain and France the idea of ​​restricting military expansion. However, the general military personnel present unanimously opposed this countermeasure, because doing so would definitely require a military demonstration first. Otherwise, it would never take effect. If a demonstration is to be made, it must at least wait until the military projects currently being built in Spain are completed. Moreover, in the event that the demonstration is ineffective and a war starts, then Germany, even if united with Japan and Italy, is still not sure of fighting together against Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China. At this point, Ribbentrop, the current Foreign Minister who is famous for being anti-British, put forward a plan: to negotiate with Britain a "non-interference agreement" that Germany and Britain will not participate in the event that a war is caused by the Franco-Italian dispute, on the condition that only recovering the pre-war colonies is regarded as satisfaction. According to him, this move will definitely be welcomed by the British Chamberlain Cabinet; the reason is: (1) Britain's absolutely unwilling mentality to fight, even if France is attacked, as long as it is sure that it will not be affected, will not change; (2) On the issue of colonies, there are many pro-German dignitaries in Britain who agree that the pre-war German colonies taken over by Britain can be returned to it first. He said that this way, France can be isolated and defeated; in that situation, the most important point is that the United States does not get involved. However, this plan was immediately opposed by Goering, thinking it was a fantasy. As a result, it was not passed. However, Germany has recently temporarily bundled aside other urgent issues, and is talking loudly about the return of colonies (in fact, this contradicts her most fundamental plan: the principle of postponing the issue of colonies until the navy has sufficient strength). This point is worth our attention. Hitler has long stated: "Germany will not meet other countries with soldiers for the sake of the colonial issue."</p>
<p>Admittedly, what is worrying is still the wavering nature of the British Chamberlain Cabinet. However, if the US attitude does not change, the Chamberlain Cabinet probably will never go to a major downfall risk and come up with any new tricks. Judging from the current situation, as long as Roosevelt gives a few fierce speeches attacking Chamberlain, it will immediately cause major unrest in British domestic politics. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>What is the US attitude? Everyone knows that there is absolutely no problem; saying that it is unreliable is just an excuse for British Chamberlain and Simon-like figures. Recently, a senior US congressional figure said very interestingly: "If President Roosevelt wants to participate in the war, then most Americans will follow behind him. The reason is: Americans have long hated the fascist Germany, Japan, and Italy, and hope to give them a lesson!" According to him, there are three powerful factions in the United States that hate these three countries: (1) Jews, (2) Catholics, (3) Negroes (ie black people). And recently, a fourth faction has been added; that is: all American capitalists facing the dumping competition of Germany, Japan, and Italy in the world market. (February 17)</p>

<h3>Strengthening Air Defense Capabilities: Hong Kong to Recruit Air Force Volunteers, Prepare to Enlist in Times of Emergency, and Increase Aircraft and Anti-Aircraft Gun Units Stationed in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>In order to cope with the treacherous world situation, the British military authorities are implementing military expansion, especially focusing on the expansion of the Air Force, planning to establish 500 air force squadrons overseas to protect British colonies. In the Far East, Singapore and Hong Kong will both significantly increase the air force stationed there. Before 1940, the strength of the Hong Kong Air Force, both in terms of pilots and the number of aircraft, will be greatly expanded in accordance with the planned schedule. In order to adapt to this step, the Hong Kong Air Force authorities are proceeding to recruit Royal Air Force reservists in Hong Kong, and registration will begin during the day. All Hong Kong residents can register to participate. The Hong Kong Army Volunteer Corps currently has a flying squadron, and its pilots are sent by the government to the Far East Flying School at Kai Tak Airport for training. However, the number of people is very small. The Air Force Volunteer Corps currently being planned is different from this organization. At the same time, those who participate in the team must enlist in the event of an emergency. Singapore will also make similar recruitments. The detailed regulations will be promulgated once they are sent by the British government. According to another news report, the British military authorities will increase the number of anti-aircraft gun units stationed in the area, so that the air defense fire net is complete and leaves no room for enemy aircraft to operate. Hong Kong has high mountains of more than 1,800 feet, and the New Territories also has many majestic mountains, making it most suitable for setting up anti-aircraft gun positions. As it stands, the air defense force is quite solid. In the future, after the expansion of the Air Force and the completion of the plan, its power will be even stronger. The Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Air Force is currently stationed in Singapore. In the future, after the completion of the military expansion plan, Hong Kong may need to set up a deputy commander or a higher-level commander. Since the opening of the air defense exhibition, many Chinese and Western people have gone to visit. The exhibition continued to be open for the past two days, and the audience was even more crowded, reaching five or six thousand people every day, showing that Hong Kong people are very interested in air defense work. Air defense expert, Stephen Perkins, has received many letters from residents of Wan Chai, Kowloon, and other places requesting that air defense exhibitions be held in the area. If the environment permits, they will be held in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon in sequence to popularize the public's air defense knowledge. The air defense exhibition is open all day today and will close at noon tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Supply Depends Entirely on Imports: Hong Kong Coal Industry's Pessimistic Future, Supply Cut Off Once War Comes, Over 720,000 Tons Imported Last Year</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Weida Company released its seventh annual report yesterday, which details the situation of the Hong Kong coal industry last year, and is pessimistic about the future of the Hong Kong coal industry, believing that although prices have remained at a high level last year, unless shipping returns to normal, the prospect of large-scale transactions is very slim. Hong Kong is in an unenviable position, as the supply of coal in Hong Kong depends entirely on imports. If war breaks out and the source is cut off, it will be greatly difficult. The problem of coal supply is not only related to shipping, but also worthy of the attention of those who make defense plans. Last year, Hong Kong imported 725,063 tons of coal from various places, worth a total of $13,800,3826. After exporting 56,363 tons, the remaining 668,700 tons were for use in Hong Kong. The largest amount of the above-mentioned imports was from Japan (including Korea and Taiwan), totaling 285,900 tons, worth a total of $5,257,982. The year before was 529,826 tons, worth a total of $7,989,889. Last year, the average price of Japanese coal was $18.90 per ton, while the year before was $15.</p>

<h3>Meningitis Outbreak: Acute Contagion, Alarming Spread; Nearly Seventy Patients Admitted; Medical Director Urges Residents to Take Precautions</h3>
<p>Cerebrospinal meningitis (commonly known as meningitis) is an acute infectious disease. Last year, the disease spread considerably in Hong Kong, reaching an intensity unseen in twenty years. Since the beginning of spring this year, the spread has been particularly severe. According to statistics from the health authorities, the number of cases is double that of the same period last year. The increase has been especially pronounced in the past few weeks. Regarding this matter, Hong Kong's Medical Director, Sze-to Wing-kok, yesterday issued a special notice advising residents to take extra precautions. He stated that there are nearly seventy patients currently admitted to the Kennedy Infectious Diseases Hospital. People of all ages are susceptible to infection. According to statistics on patients last year, most were children or adolescents under the age of fifteen, and even infants died from the disease. Despite receiving the most comprehensive medical care, one out of every two patients treated last year died. The transmission of this disease is mostly due to recovered patients or current patients carrying the bacteria in their throats. Those with weak constitutions and poor hygiene are also more likely to contract the disease. In addition, two important factors serve as a medium for the spread of this disease: overcrowded housing and poor ventilation. The symptoms of the disease include headache, fever, stiff neck and back, and vomiting. Children may also experience convulsions or even loss of consciousness or rashes. The most important preventive measure is to ensure good ventilation in one's home.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Trust in Solicitation: Guangdong National Defense Bonds Begin Paying Interest; Guarantee Committee Allocates Sufficient Funds of 600,000 Yuan; Hong Kong Office Notifies Overseas Chinese to Collect</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong office of the Guangdong Provincial National Defense Bonds Solicitation Committee recently notified all solicitation team leaders that interest payments on the bonds have begun. They requested that they inform bond purchasers to go to the Hong Kong branch of the Guangdong Bank to collect their interest. The notice stated, "The Guangdong Bank has announced that February 28th of this year is the date for the first interest payment on the Guangdong National Defense Bonds. The Guangdong Provincial National Defense Bonds Fund Management Committee has allocated sufficient national currency of 600,000 yuan to the bank to ensure that interest payments are made on time, thereby maintaining trust in the bonds. To facilitate the collection of interest by bondholders, interest can be collected at the bank and its branch offices at maturity. For interest amounts of 200 yuan or less in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, the local exchange rate can be used to convert and collect the interest in local currency. For amounts exceeding 200 yuan, a head office draft will be issued for payment." Considering that interest payments on the Guangdong National Defense Bonds have begun, this not only maintains trust in previous solicitations but also boosts the morale of the people to save their hometowns in the future. This information should be conveyed to your team leaders, and you are respectfully requested to immediately and effectively notify your members and former solicitors to inform bond purchasers to go to the Hong Kong branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank on Ice House Street to collect their interest.</p>

<p>From the bloody lessons, we know that we have suffered greatly from eating the "scientific young thorn." There is much that the great cause of "resistance against aggression" and "national construction" depends on science for. The leader also made it clear at this national education conference: "This battle of ours is not only about striving for national survival, but also about transforming our nation and reviving our country during this period. Therefore, our focus in education should not only be on the wartime period, but also on the post-war period. We need to estimate what level our national knowledge and abilities should be raised to in order for our country to become a modern country. To build our country into a modern country, we need tens of thousands of specialized scholars, hundreds of thousands or even millions of technicians and engineers, and millions of teachers and cadres for public training in various departments. These all need to be supplied by our education sector. These problems all need to be solved by our education sector." This clearly illustrates the importance of science education. Moreover, since the outbreak of the war of resistance, we have focused on propaganda and mobilization efforts, while abandoning the promotion and efforts in natural sciences, which are urgently needed for the war of resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot help but place infinite hope on the nationally renowned purely practical university, National Tongji University. Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Yongqing, director of the school's Hong Kong office (and also director of the school's advanced vocational department), and learned about the general recent developments of the school. This urgently needs to be reported to readers here, in order to arouse readers' renewed attention to science education.</p>
<p>Tongji University has a history of more than thirty years, initially established by Germans. It has been formally nationalized for more than ten years. Administratively and economically, it has no connection with Germany and is a genuine national school.</p>
<p>The school currently has over a thousand students, with the College of Engineering accounting for the most at over four hundred. The College of Medicine has two hundred students, and the College of Science has over one hundred. The affiliated high school has about three hundred students. The affiliated advanced vocational school also has over two hundred students. The College of Engineering is divided into departments of Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Surveying, and Naval Architecture. The College of Science is divided into three departments: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The advanced vocational school graduates high school students who take the entrance examination and graduate after four years of vocational study. It is divided into two departments: Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering. The school does not have arts or law subjects and is a purely practical university.</p>
<p>Tuition fees for university students are only ten national currency per year, high school students are only five national currency per year, and advanced vocational school is completely free. This cannot be compared to the aristocratic education of capitalist societies. Like Jiaotong University and Beiyang Institute of Technology, the career prospects of the school's students are in greater demand than supply. Graduates can avoid the misfortune of unemployment.</p>
<p>The school's original site was in Wusong, Shanghai, and it has been reduced to ashes under the "August 13th" × human artillery fire. Fortunately, the staff and students retreated safely. Except for large-scale machinery that was inconvenient to move, the rest of the school's instruments, machines, books, and other school equipment were moved inland. After a long journey, all staff and students have now arrived in Kunming, Yunnan. Although the school buildings of our schools have been destroyed by the × human artillery fire, our educational spirit has become even stronger. The Fifth Rehabilitation Hospital of the Military Affairs Commission is jointly operated with the school. This is truly infuriating to the "Japanese Imperial Army"!</p>
<p>The school's professors, apart from about twenty who are German, are all Chinese professors. Because Germany is a friend of our × humans, more than a dozen German professors have left their posts since the outbreak of the war of resistance. Sacred scholarship has borders; this is also a new record created by Mr. Hitler of the "卐" brand and his "good friend," the Japanese Imperial Army.</p>
<p>The school was also included in the joint new student examination for national universities sponsored by the Ministry of Education, and classes officially started in Kunming on the 2nd of this month. However, to facilitate the enrollment of students, the Ministry of Education has specially approved the school to enroll students again, holding examinations in three locations: Kunming, Chongqing, and Hong Kong. It is reported that there are already more than one thousand students applying in the three locations, but the number of admissions in the future will only be four hundred.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, as of yesterday's interview, there were more than ninety applicants. The entrance examination will be held at Wah Hsia College today and tomorrow. Among these ninety-plus people, there are the most from True Light Girls' Middle School. Most of them are graduating seniors from the third year of high school, because those who are eager to study fear that it will not be easy to have the opportunity to recruit in Hong Kong in the future. It is also because of the convenience afforded by the "equivalent academic ability" regulations.</p>
<p>Except for the Chinese course in high school, the school mostly uses German textbooks. Therefore, among the ninety-plus new applicants in Hong Kong, those who plan to enter the German remedial course account for more than sixty people. After passing the German remedial course for one year, they can formally enter the university undergraduate course next year. This is a feature of the school.</p>
<p>In the tempering of the war of resistance, politics has gradually improved, and science is about to rise. In addition to having sophisticated technology, a scientific talent should also have political awareness. Under the leadership of the school's president, Mr. Weng Zhilong, and with the assistance of the capable new secretary-general, Mr. Chen Shaoxian, the future is unlimited. For the sake of the soaring progress of scientific education in the motherland, we place infinite hope on National Tongji University, which is purely practical!</p>
<h3>Labor Department Prepares to Improve Workers' Lives While Child Laborers Suffer</h3>
<p>How are these children struggling under inhuman oppression?</p>
<p>Factories have always exploited underage child laborers to save money, or make workers work overtime, impacting workers' health. Therefore, we feel that improving the lives of child laborers not only enhances their health but also upholds humanity!</p>
<p>Due to the pressures of life, many parents send their children, barely of school age, to workshops and shops as apprentices. If we pass by iron shops and other small workshops, we see children in dirty clothes, their faces pale, sitting on the ground, heads buried in their work. These are the apprentices!</p>
<p>They work from six or seven in the morning until six or seven in the evening. All day long, they do heavy work, like delivering iron tools to customers and hammering with iron hammers weighing more than ten pounds. Even though they are extremely exhausted, they dare not take a short rest. Sometimes, they can't bear the weight of the iron tools, but they have to clench their teeth and carry them desperately. Their spines, which have not yet fully developed, are bent. That kind of miserable situation is enough to bring tears to one’s eyes!</p>
<p>Every day, besides doing strenuous labor, they also do cleaning and other trivial tasks. Some shops don't even hire cooks. So, these teenagers have to shoulder the responsibility of cooking. Let me tell you, being a "cook" is not an easy task! If you are not careful, you will burn the rice or spoil the dishes, and you will surely be beaten, or at the very least, severely scolded, because employers will never understand a child who makes mistakes.</p>
<p>These apprentices, after eating two meals of plain rice, often don't even get a monthly salary of one dime. Nutritious food is out of the question. Even wanting a "cooling tea" is difficult. Due to an unbalanced diet and extreme fatigue, they gradually become ill, especially with lung disease being the most common. This disease progresses slowly, and because they don't know how to treat it, many are disabled before they even finish learning their skills.</p>
<p>Naturally, this situation is not limited to iron shops. As far as we know, many similar incidents occur in wood shops and other shops. Generally, bosses are frantically using these child laborers as stepping stones for their businesses. It is said that a certain association in Kowloon is using a group of ignorant children to make various crafts for them and even using them as salesmen to promote these products. The reward is only two meals and a place to sleep. What a profitable business this is! When reporters asked the children who came out of the association to promote the products about their treatment, they stared at me with blank eyes. Although they dared not speak, their pale yellow faces were covered with traces of pain—naturally, these child laborers are in a slightly better environment than the apprentices groping in the dark.</p>
<p>We feel that the lives of these child laborers and apprentices are like gambling, and success or failure is only a fine line apart. But in fact, many parents, even though they have heard of such unfortunate events, are willing to gamble with their children's lives because they are poor. And some parents who want to send their children to be apprentices can't even find a way to do so!</p>
<p>Investigating and warning those employers who abuse child laborers, and punishing them, is a quick fix for improving the lives of child laborers. But how to ensure that these unfortunate children all have equal opportunities for work and education is the fundamental solution!</p>
<h3>Murder in the Tea Fragrance Room: Japanese Man Dies from Injuries, Li Bingjin Charged with Murder, British Prosecutor Requests Change of Charge Yesterday, Li Listened Calmly</h3>
<p>Li Bingjin, the defendant in the blood case at Tea Fragrance Room, No. 81 Hennessy Road, appeared again at the Central Magistracy yesterday morning before Judge Fuller. The chief prosecutor, British Detective Superintendent Deakin, stood up and told the court that the plaintiff, Japanese national Aihara Yoshimichi, died in the hospital on March 4 due to his injuries. Therefore, he now charged the defendant with murder and asked the court to allow the case to be adjourned for a week. The judge granted the request and corrected the name on the file. The defendant was remanded in custody. The defendant was a waiter at the Tea Fragrance Room. On the early morning of January 29, he suddenly went mad in the store and stabbed the Japanese man with a knife. He then went to Police Station No. 2 to turn himself in. The police then arrested him and charged him with two counts: one was that he had attacked the Japanese man Aihara Yoshimichi, and the other was that he had injured Aihara Yoshimichi's body, committing attempted murder. Now that the Japanese man has died, the police, according to regulations, have changed the charge against the defendant to the above-mentioned crime. The defendant appeared in a velvet-collared Western suit yesterday, his eyes sunken. When he heard the interpreter read out the charge, his expression was unaffected and he remained very calm.</p>

<h3>Xijiang Army Busy Rotating Troops, X Tian Secretly Arrives at Hekou, X Secretly Discusses Invasion Plans but Feels Troops are Weak, I and X Confront Each Other Across the River in Gaoyao and Sihui</h3>
<p>(Xijiang Quick News) The Xijiang X Army has been frequently rotating its troops recently. The Guangsan Main Road, Guangyun Highway, and Jiangfo Highway are bustling with X Army activity. According to reports, the X Army has indeed increased along the lines, reaching about 3,000 men on the Xin Line, suggesting a planned action. Xijiang X Commander Que Tian secretly arrived at Hekou from Foshan on the 6th, summoning X Army officers from various units to secretly discuss invasion plans. It is said that X currently feels that the force on the Western Line is still weak and intends to temporarily take a defensive position in the short term, waiting for the troop strength to be replenished before launching an attack. Therefore, while transporting the X Army, they are also actively building fortifications in the southwest Hekou Makouganggen area, strengthening the defenses of Jiujiang, Heqing, and Mumian, enhancing their strength to prevent our army from counterattacking.</p>
<p>Our Army Counterattacks</p>
<p>On the one hand, they send troops to harass our villages in an attempt to eliminate our guerrilla team strength. However, since our elite troops have successively arrived in Xijiang, a strong line of defense has been formed in the Gaoyao, Sihui, Gaoming, and Heshan areas, confronting X across the river and closely monitoring and controlling X. Deng Longguang, commander of the X X Army, is still on the front line summoning generals from various units to plan offensive and defensive strategies. Therefore, although there is no major contact in the Xijiang battle at present, both sides are secretly preparing for the coming of a major war. Furthermore, it has been found that the Jiujiang Heqing X Army has been wantonly harassing nearby villages for days. On the 6th and 7th, more than a hundred X soldiers, divided among more than ten steamships and rubber boats, went from Shakou to Taiping Xaxu, claiming to be searching for guerrilla teams, taking the opportunity to rob property. At that time, the villagers in the area were caught off guard and suffered extensive looting. The X Army also forced the villages to accept the orders of the Jiujiang puppet maintenance association, recommending village chiefs to be responsible for ensuring that no guerrilla teams emerge in the village, otherwise the township head would be held accountable. The people there, under the X's tyranny, dared not disobey, but feared the blame of siding with X when our army counterattacks. Therefore, local gentry with some influence have been fleeing in recent days to avoid humiliation.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Finance Seeks to Make Up Deficit, Plans to Increase Tax on Imported Luxury Goods, Slight Adjustment of Internal Finance Department, Actively Training Skilled Personnel</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Quick News] In order to increase work efficiency, Gu Yiqun, Director of the Finance Department, has made slight adjustments to the internal organization and abolished redundant agencies to save public funds. In total, the department now has one secretariat and four sections. Gui Jingqiu will remain as the director of the secretariat, and Yang Zhongli and others will be newly appointed as secretaries. Xu Rongyin is the head of the first section, which handles general affairs; Lin Xijing is the head of the second section, which handles land tax; Du Meihe is the head of the third section, which handles donation tax; and Zhu Shenwei is the head of the fourth section, which handles county finance. The Provincial Tax Deed General Office and the Regulations Review Committee, and the Miscellaneous Tax Review Committee and other redundant agencies are also abolished. Several people familiar with local finance and donation experience are appointed as inspectors to step up guidance and improve tax and finance matters in various tax bureaus and county and municipal governments. Currently, the main sources of revenue in Guangdong Province are (1) tax on imported goods, (2) land tax, and (3) business tax. Since current revenues are insufficient to cover expenditures, the revenue part may increase the tax on imported luxury goods that do not affect people's livelihood to make up for the deficit. This matter is currently being planned. Director Gu also intends to establish a financial personnel training institute to cultivate a large number of skilled financial management personnel and eliminate malpractices.</p>
<h3>Active Taishan Female Conscripts, Posture of the Taishan Women's National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>[Taishan Correspondence] To meet the needs of the new phase of the War of Resistance, the women's community has appeared in Taishan society with an extremely active posture.</p>
<p>In the past, the achievements of the Taishan women's movement left us with a very deep impression. Since the tide of the National Revolution swept into Taishan, the Taishan society, which had always been silent, bravely raised the banner of the women's movement. The work at that time not only coordinated with the revolutionary situation at the time, but also laid the foundation for the Taishan women's movement. The Taishan Women's Liberation Association became a permanent legal organization under the leadership of the government at that time. Its work developed with the development of history. After the Great Northern Expedition of 1925-1927, affected by the world economic crisis of 1929 and the objective conditions of the unbalanced cultural development of various places in Taishan, the Taishan women's movement was temporarily silent. The Women's Movement Association was reorganized and affiliated to the Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>The "July 7th" Incident ignited the flames of the War of Resistance, and the national salvation movement in Taishan also rose. The women's community was of course no exception. Thus, along with the great torrent of the War of Resistance, a women's national salvation organization affiliated to the Taishan Support Association was created. This organization, under a momentary enthusiasm, had done some things, but due to the unsound internal organization and the scramble for leadership by those who were concerned with the limelight, it finally stopped working.</p>
<p>After the successive fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, Taishan entered a state of war. The Taishan women's national salvation movement also embarked on a new direction. They tried their best to avoid the disturbance of those who were concerned with the limelight and planned to carry out their work, and they also achieved great results. The central organization of the current movement is the Alumni Association of the Taishan Women's Military Training Cadre Training Class.</p>
<p>The work in the past few months has been rapidly developed. The first phase of women's training has ended, and the results are very good. In the county urban area, except for the female employees and prostitutes in the tea houses, it is not easy to see a woman with powder and rouge on the street. The young ladies who were hidden in their boudoirs in the past are now heroic heroines in majestic military uniforms. In the countryside, they are no longer like the shy women who peeped from under their bamboo hats in the past. Moreover, you can easily hear them speak. Once, I went to the countryside for some things, and on the mountain road, I heard two young women clearly say,</p>
<p>"This place can be used as a stronghold for military defense."</p>
<p>"If the Japanese soldiers occupy Taicheng, I will definitely sneak up on them from this place."</p>
<p>"If there is a light machine gun in this bunker, I dare to guard this pass."</p>
<p>The end of the first phase of women's training has already yielded such results. The second phase followed immediately. They recently published the Alumni Association Journal, striving to improve women's knowledge of the War of Resistance and eliminate illiteracy among women in wartime. It is also written in the opening speech of this publication,</p>
<p>In addition to the skills given to the female conscripts in the tactical course, we also need to declare political consciousness and mobilization.</p>
<p>Obviously, in the second phase of women's training, they will go to the countryside to implement their planned training for political consciousness mobilization.</p>
<p>In short, the Taishan women's movement has sprouted. No matter where in Taishan, we can see majestic women practicing with live ammunition. Not only that, but currently, the women of Taishan who work in the fields or walk on the fields are no longer chaotically chattering like three women acting as one horse, but have become a solemn and majestic song of "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves."

<h3>Yunnan and Guangxi Actively Connect Transportation, Guangxi Sends Personnel to Yunnan and Guizhou to Discuss Plans</h3>
<p>[Gezhou Quick News] Xia Wei, Chief of Staff of the Fifth Route Army and Acting Commander-in-Chief, recently stated that the conspiracy of violent X to spy on Guangxi is becoming increasingly urgent. The national defense of Guangxi Province is becoming more and more serious. In addition to stepping up the mobilization of the military and civilians to resist Japan and defend the territory and actively deploying military affairs on the border, since Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces are adjacent to each other, and are important bases for the overall War of Resistance, all water conservancy, telecommunications, and transportation should be closely linked and developed. Therefore, the headquarters recently sent the director of the Transportation Department to visit Guizhou and Yunnan to meet with the military authorities of the two provinces to discuss everything. A concrete plan has now been discussed. It is heard that regarding the communication of news among the three provinces, it has been decided to increase the wired and wireless network to exchange news at any time. As for land transportation, it has also been decided to increase the number of highway escort teams and engineering teams so that they can be repaired at any time in case of X damage. In addition, branch roads will be expanded to connect the provinces to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Amidst Tension in Jiangmen, Jiangfo Road is Destroyed Again, Xinhui and Heshan Have Made Practical Connections, If X Invades, We Will Gladly Fight</h3>
<p>[Jiangmen Quick News] In recent days, the atmosphere in Jiangmen City has been quite tense, rumors have been rife, but public security is still good. The military, police and teams are strictly guarding day and night. Yesterday, the reporter went to the headquarters of the Fifth District Guerrilla Area to meet with Deputy Commander Zhou Hanqian to inquire about everything.</p>
<p>If X Invades, We Will Gladly Fight</p>
<p>Zhou said that the X has been clamoring to attack Jiangmen for more than just today. However, according to the information obtained by this headquarters, the X in Jiujiang are indeed eager to try to attack Xinhui and Heshan counties. Jiangmen, a coastal city, is also one of the targets of the X people. Our defense forces and teams do not distinguish between the severity of the defense based on whether the X people are invading or not. If they attack, our army will be happy to fight. As for public security in the city, with strict patrols, we can ensure that there is no trouble. At present, the most important task is to prevent it. Therefore, the inspection of travelers must be particularly meticulous.</p>
<p>Destroy the Highway to Prevent X from Peeping</p>
<p>As for the Jiangfo Highway, its fourth section is in Xinhui, from Yugang to Shuanglong, very close to Jiangmen. It was initially ordered to be destroyed, and then repaired to restore military communication, the reason being to facilitate our military transport. Currently, the defense deployment in Xinhui has been completed. At the same time, in order to prevent the X from attacking Heshan and peeping at Xinhui along the Longlu Road, the authorities will thoroughly destroy that section again. From the 8th of this month, the military can no longer pass. The military authorities of Xinhui and Heshan have also made practical connections and are preparing step by step.</p>
<h3>Battlefield Inspection, Visit to the Xijiang Outpost "Dian," Interview with the Commander of the Hantang Bitter Battle</h3>
<p>Dasha, which belongs to Sihui County, is one hundred li away from Zhaoqing and occupies an important position on the outer defense line of Xijiang. The X's artillery shells and bombs have completely destroyed everything in the market, and at the same time awakened the people here and embarked on the road of resisting Japan. They formed organizations to defend their homeland and armed themselves.</p>
<p>1.  Paying Respects at the Battlefield</p>
<p>During the outpost inspection, the reporter was accompanied by Deputy Squadron Commander Huang Xiqiu of the X Brigade of the Revenue Police Corps, and went from Dasha to Daligang "Zaogang and Hantang" on the front line. This is separated from the X's position by only a small river a few hundred yards wide, and machine guns are firing back and forth every day. Fortunately, there was silence on this day. There were no dark clouds of war in the sky, and the X planes did not come to talk. Crossing the uneven and already damaged highway, the magnificent project of the Dasha Bridge can no longer be seen, but the traces of the iron men guarding Xijiang can be seen at any time. Among the villages, under the big trees, and in the fields, they are everywhere, talking, admiring, three or five of them.</p>
<p>In the desolate hills and grassy areas by the river, the soldiers of the outpost are hidden. Although the sea breeze blows in the face and there is a deep cold, the soldiers' blood is hot. They single-mindedly hold the iron guns, aiming forward, and do not have half a minute or half a point of spare energy to care about the issue of "clothing."</p>
<p>Life in the trenches is infinitely warm and tense. If there is any movement from the X ahead, our heroes will all be eager to try and wait for a good opportunity to show their skills. But when they find that the X have quietly left, everyone can only sigh, "We can't fight this time, when will we have the chance?" Yes, our warriors are hungry, urgently wanting to eat barbarian meat and drink Japanese slave blood.</p>
<p>Our materials are indeed quite lacking, and the front-line fortifications cannot fully utilize the latest science to build them up. However, the warriors on this front line have experienced the "January 28th" battle, and they have rich experience in "knowing yourself and knowing your enemy" in combat. They skillfully built various simple fortifications. Deputy Squadron Commander Huang showed us the traces of the shells fired by the X, which were full of holes in the mountains, but did not have much impact on our soldiers' hidden trenches.</p>
<p>2.  Talking About the Battle Situation</p>
<p>The old Sanshui and Daligang Zaogang Hantang area near the river have been lost and regained. On a certain day in February, the X made a major move, landed and fought with us for a day. It was the largest battle on the western front after the fall of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Deputy Squadron Commander Huang was the commander of this battle. Speaking of the various reports of the battle situation, he expressed regret. "The X suddenly attacked at about 6:00 a.m. that day, with more than 30 large and small steel cannons and five aircraft. They used three-dimensional tactics to bomb and bombard our front-line positions in the old Sanshui Xialigang Zaogang area. The entire position was plunged into an encirclement of smoke and flames. More than 800 X soldiers landed in the old Sanshui Gomei area under the dense artillery fire. We prepared our firepower, discovered the target in Xialigang, and concentrated our fire with a sound. The X charged fiercely, and we fired densely. The two sides were getting closer and closer. The X's big roar had at least 20 rounds every minute, destroying our fortifications completely. Our brothers scattered quickly and continued to fight. After an hour, they retreated to Zaogang.</p>
<p>"At about 9:00, Squadron Leader Zhou Zhongshi was too brave and disregarded his own safety to defend this 'point.' He rushed into the X's position and broke a few hand grenades, gloriously sacrificing himself. The brothers gnashed their teeth and vowed to avenge him. Unfortunately, Zaogang also retreated to the main positions of Jiugang Zhuzhou Hantang area in an environment where there was no danger to defend. The X people did not know whether to live or die and continued to charge fiercely. At this time, the brothers led reinforcements and rushed to counterattack head-on.</p>
<p>"After taking in the scattered soldiers who had retreated from the front line, they held on to the main position. The Ma Fang side was also notified to prepare for a flank attack. The brothers from Dasha also rushed to help. We didn't know what time it was in the fire. Charge, charge, charge fiercely, and don't allow half a step back. The brothers were like crazy, not knowing that they were dead. Hand grenades and bayonets were used together, and they did their best to kill more than seventy X soldiers. The X's momentum gradually collapsed. We charged and killed again, not giving them half a second to breathe. We always maintained the main position and did not change after being bombed by the cannons.</p>
<p>"At about 12:00, we rushed to the original positions of Zaogang Xialigang. The brothers were very happy and ran forward, killing anyone they saw. The X people couldn't stand, so they had to retreat to the old Sanshui Gomei. We didn't pursue it any further in order to adjust the position. However, the X soldiers did not dare to stay and retreated to Sanshui Hekou at 4:00 p.m. that day.</p>
<p>"I dare to conclude that the casualties of the X people were indeed more than one hundred, including some lieutenants. As for us, only a few brothers were injured or killed. The ratio of fighting was one to five, and the settlement was one to ten. This is unprecedented glory and the greatest honor of the country. We mourn Squadron Leader Zhou's sacrifice on the one hand, and celebrate his sacrifice for the country on the other. He was brave and glorious.</p>
<p>"The X people consumed more than 6,000 shells and countless machine gun bullets that day. The only thing they got was the corpses of Japanese soldiers who had air coming in and no air coming out.</p>
<p>"All the original positions are now under our guard's control. These days have been very quiet. Maybe the X people have tasted the taste here and dare not come again." Deputy Squadron Commander Huang passionately recalled the course of this bitter battle.</p>
<p>"We and the brothers who have returned from the Nanxun line are now holding hands tightly and building a long wall that is not easy to shake to protect Xijiang. Tell the compatriots in the rear to work hard to support the brothers on the front line." Huang, a tall deputy squadron commander, said firmly to the reporter on the way back.</p>
<p>We are infinitely grateful to the national defenders on the front line of Xijiang, and at the same time, we sincerely and earnestly hope that our compatriots in the rear will give them enthusiastic assistance and work together to strive for the realization of the final victory. Xiao Pin</p>

<h3>One Hundred and One Hollywood Shortcuts to Success (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>(29) Know someone who knows that someone is needed to hire a double (who stands in front of the camera to adjust the lighting for the lead actor before they arrive). Jean Chatburn started as a stand-in for Belle Bennett.</p>
<p>(30) Know someone who knows that an office worker is needed at that studio. Margaret Tallichet started as a stenographer in the publicity department.</p>
<p>(31) Learn to speak with a British accent. Walk confidently into the manager's office and tell him about your theatrical experience in England. Margaret Lindsay achieved great success this way.</p>
<p>(32) Have your mother take a good photo of you and send it to people looking for actors, with a note saying, "You should see him in person." Bob Baker got a screen test this way.</p>
<p>(33) Play football in college, then become a lifeguard on Venice Beach in California. Like Andy Devine, one day someone looking for actors will be looking for a burly comedic character.</p>
<p>(34) Keep the newspapers guessing about you. Is she married to that big star already? Or is she just a long-term houseguest? The reporters had a hard time figuring out Paulette Goddard.</p>
<p>(35) Marry a husband who can help you improve your elocution and supports your screen ambitions. Then, play roles in Hollywood with a demure and mysterious air, like Sigrid Gurie.</p>
<p>(36) Be a Hollywood eccentric. Wear strange clothes and stroll down the street, loudly reciting Shakespeare. John Carradine was rewarded for this.</p>
<p>(37) Be able to play three hundred different roles. If Hollywood hasn't come calling yet, then take the initiative and go to them. Whatever your past experience is, there's always some use for it. Just look at Ralph Bellamy and George Brent.</p>
<p>(38) Win a beauty contest – and you also need to have some brains. Hollywood is full of beautiful, brainless girls, so only a few of those who win awards and succeed in the film industry are those who can learn a little more, like Gail Patrick, Ann Sheridan, and Marjorie Weaver.</p>
<p>(39) Be an artist's model, and this artist is often visited by people who discover talented actors. That's how they found Norma Shearer, Jean Arthur, and Kay Francis. Garbo was also discovered when she was a hat shop model.</p>
<p>(40) If you can sing, have your sister encourage you to perform at a concert, and those people looking for actors just happen to be listening. There you go, you're another Shirley Temple!</p>
<p>(41) Announce all the Hollywood gossip in newspapers or on the radio, like Walter Winchell and Jimmie Fidler.</p>
<p>(42) Have a beautiful figure to help you sing in a dance band. Look at Alice Faye, Michele Morgan, and Priscilla Lane.</p>
<p>(43) Go to college near Hollywood. Play the lead roles in the school's drama club, and be beautiful. Remember Robert Taylor?</p>
<p>(44) Fall in love with a Hollywood reporter. He will sing your praises, and sooner or later he will bring someone to ask you to audition. Janet Gaynor entered the film industry this way.</p>
<p>(45) Make funny faces and funny poses. Be a model at Walt Disney's cartoon studio. Eddie Collins, who modeled for Dopey in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, became an actor.</p>
<p>(46) Work as a manicurist in a large Hollywood beauty salon. Wait for an honest person to suggest you try out for movies. Arleen Whelan only waited two weeks.</p>
<p>(47) Work at a soda fountain or delivering sodas in a Hollywood candy store. There are also opportunities. Ellen Drew only waited a year.</p>
<p>(48) Through a friend's introduction, become a substitute actress for the lead in a major Hollywood theater. When that lead retires, you'll be the next Olivia de Havilland.</p>
<p>(49) Join a chorus line. Try to get into the front row of dancers. That way, people looking for actors can easily see you. Joan Crawford did it this way.</p>
<p>(50) Be a brilliant player on a famous Western football team, like John Mack Brown.</p>
<p>(51) When a film company goes to the South Seas to shoot on location, rush there and pretend to be an explorer, like Errol Flynn.</p>
<p>(52) Have a face like the girl painted on the cover of a major magazine, like Larry Simms.</p>
<p>(53) Sing in the shower at the gym, hoping that the music director from a film company hears you, like Anthony Marlow.</p>
<p>(54) Go to Hollywood High School. Eat breakfast at the diner across the street from school between classes. Suddenly, a friend from a film company comes in. Lana Turner became an actress.</p>
<p>(55) Try to be an extra – these opportunities are rare now. Extras refuse to let newcomers join, but if you are already an extra, wear clothes that are much better than the other extras. This method is very helpful to Achille Mauzan.</p>
<p>(56) Be a photographer for eighteen years, and then perform some funny poses in front of your own camera. David Oliver became a comedian.</p>
<p>(57) Lead an American jazz band performing in Venice, Italy. Then, Merle Davis convinces him to try acting in films. This was Scott Colton's method.</p>
<p>(58) Perform outstanding programs in nightclubs, like the Ritz Brothers, Martha Raye, and Margo.</p>
<p>(59) If you look like a certain star, and you can speak in the same manner as them, then run into the film company and ask for an audition. Frankie Burke got the role of the young James Cagney in "Angels with Dirty Faces" this way.</p>
<p>(60) Run into the company and insist that you are the brother (or sister) of a famous actress, and ask for an audition. One child used this method, and before it was exposed, not only did he get an audition, but he also got a role. As long as he performs well, the company won't pursue the matter.</p>
<p>(61) Know the phone number of someone who works at a casting agency. Make a long-distance call to him and ask for a role in a new film. Mary Bovard got her first role this way.</p>
<p>(62) If you can draw, draw a picture of a certain director from a photograph, and then send it to him to show your talent. This gave Myrna Madison a chance for a screen test.</p>
<p>(63) Take a set of your own funny photos and send them to a director, like Robert Trasker recently did, and ask for an audition.</p>
<p>(64) Look like a Latino, but speak English. Perform the tango in a nightclub. Talent scouts discovered Cesar Romero. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Two Strong Teams from the Chinese Community Battle It Out for the Silver Medal Finals Spot. Held at So Kon Po Ground This Afternoon at 4 PM.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In this year's Special Silver Shield Football Tournament, in the First Division, there have been several instances of draws leading to two or three extra games to determine the winner, thus prolonging the schedule. Now, there is one more semi-final match, to be held this afternoon at 4 PM at So Kon Po Ground. This is the match between South China South and Eastern. The winner will gain the right to play in the finals against the Police team for the championship.</p>
<p>In the quarter-finals, South China South eliminated Kowloon Club after three matches. Eastern also eliminated South China Hua after two matches. Therefore, today's semi-final is not accidental, but a victory forged with sweat and blood. However, it is regrettable that these two powerful Chinese teams are in the same group, unable to compete in the finals together. It only benefits the dark horse in the other group, the Police team. However, the Police team does not have the aura of a champion, and their place in the finals is due to luck.</p>
<p>Based on the situation, the Police team is not a strong team and lacks the strength to compete for the championship. Therefore, today's match is equivalent to the finals, and the winner will surely have the championship in their grasp. However, when two tigers fight, one will be injured. Regardless of who wins or draws, the loser will be on a divergent path, declaring despair. Therefore, the boundary between success and failure is at stake. Who can win the leadership position in Chinese football will also be determined here.</p>
<p>Both this semi-final and the final will be played with a ninety-minute format, unlike the preliminary and quarter-final rounds. The General Association, considering the frequent occurrence of draws in the past, realizes that the outcome of today's encounter between the two strong Chinese teams is difficult to predict. If the game ends in a draw, it would be within expectations. Therefore, at the monthly meeting held a few days ago, it was decided that if the two teams are still tied after the full regulation time and extra time, a replay will be held tomorrow. If tomorrow's game also ends in a draw, a final match will be held on Wednesday of next week.</p>
<p>The weather has been erratic for the past few days, alternating between sunny and rainy. What will it be like today is still hard to predict. Let's hope that the heavens are merciful and do not spoil the football match. Then, this great battle will surely be filled with wonderful performances. If the heavens do not cooperate, the field will be wet, and the ball will be heavy, which will affect the players' performance and lack good contributions. Moreover, fighting in the rain means that the outcome cannot be judged solely based on technical skills. Therefore, the weather is a matter worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>To what extent have the two teams reached in terms of strength? Are they evenly matched? This match will reveal it clearly, giving the spectators a clear view. Estimating the strength, it cannot be lightly concluded that they are evenly matched simply because the two teams have each won once in the league process.</p>
<p>Speaking factually, South China South is a team that is good at employing tactical approaches, with deliberate attacks and well-coordinated connections. Therefore, they often win by skill. Another advantage is that each of them has been in battle for a long time, with rich experience. They do not panic in big battles, and they become stronger when facing strong enemies. It is said that this has been proven time and time again. Now, at this important juncture, they have prepared early. It is expected that their performance will not be too hasty, resulting in abnormal technical flaws. On the other hand, since being promoted to the First Division, Eastern has never touched the league and Shield titles. Now, at a time when the whole team has made great progress, they have obtained this semi-final opportunity, which is a rare opportunity. The players are eager to win and want to win quickly. Moreover, the only difficult hurdle is today. If they can win in one fell swoop, the great championship will be theirs. Because of this, all the players have made up their minds to win. They must attach too much importance to victory and be too excited. However, this kind of influence, if successful, will make the momentum stronger, and if defeated, will make the heart more anxious. Therefore, the key to the question of victory or defeat depends on which side scores the first goal. If Eastern concedes a goal first, they will inevitably become more anxious and chaotic. As for their past battles, there is no so-called style. The striker is good at raids, and the defenders are loyal to their duties. Their ability to overwhelm South China South today also depends entirely on whether the raids can succeed. However, South China South is not easy to deal with, and Eastern may not be able to succeed easily.</p>

<h3>Football Intelligence: Wu Derong Suspended, Hou Chengtuo and Pak Ga Selected to Replace Players for Philippine Tour, England Team Lineup for International Match Finalized</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Last week, during the league match between South China Hua and St. Joseph's, St. Joseph's player Wu Derong punched Xie Jinhong and was seen by the referee, who sent him off the field and reported the incident to the Executive Committee of the General Association. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, the Executive Committee held a meeting to review the incident and unanimously decided that Wu's illegal action should be punished with a suspension of games until December this year. Chen Yishaoquan, a player from the Second Division Kitchee team, also committed a similar offense and was punished with a suspension of games until the end of this season.</p>
<p>The Management Committee of the General Association discussed the selection of the Hong Kong team for the Philippine tour a few days ago. After determining the 15-member team, they sent letters to each person to inquire if they could spare the time to go. According to the replies from Navy players Lie Li and Kent, they said that they would be at sea at that time and could not help, and asked to select other people to fill the vacancies. After receiving the letters, the Management Committee selected Pak Ga of the Police and Hou Chengtuo of Eastern to fill the vacancies, and inquired their opinions. Although Li Yutang and Tan Jungan were on the list, they both work at Swedish Trading Company. The manager of the company has gone elsewhere and has not returned, so the issue of asking for leave is still under consideration and will be decided after the manager returns to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Before the Philippine team returned south, they requested that Hong Kong send a team to the Philippines in April to compete, and to send referee Aoma to accompany them. However, Aoma is occupied with business and cannot spare the time to go, so the General Association plans to send Costa instead.</p>
<p>The International Football Quarter-Finals, China vs. England, is scheduled to be held on the 19th of this month at 4 PM at the So Kon Po Ground. It is understood that the English team lineup is roughly finalized, but the British players of the Navy are at sea with the ship during the day and are difficult to help. Therefore, the strength of the English team has not been fully utilized, and there are some Second Division players included. The lineup is recorded below.</p>
<p>(Broken Army)</p>
<p>Helly</p>
<p>Pak Ga, Yi Hualishi</p>

<h3>Important Leg Muscles</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>When it comes to muscles or physical strength, people who are considered strong usually pat their chest or roll up their sleeves to show off their arms. Very few people pay attention to their legs.</p>
<p>Building a physique is no different from building a house. To make a house solid, the most important thing is a strong foundation. The legs are the foundation of our body.</p>
<p>Our physical strength is closely related to our legs. If the leg muscles are underdeveloped, even if we have strong arm strength, it cannot be fully utilized. Moreover, to have great physical strength, we must have a strong back. Underdeveloped leg muscles mean a person lacks a strong back. Because to make the back strong, we must do strenuous exercises, and most strenuous back exercises are interrelated with the legs. In other words, most strenuous back exercises are also the best leg exercises, such as "Dead Lift" and "Deep Knee Bend," which have the greatest effect on developing the muscles of both the back and legs.</p>
<p>To develop the arm, shoulder, and chest muscles to the fullest extent, it is necessary to engage in strenuous exercises. However, if the muscles of the back and legs are underdeveloped, even if one can handle strenuous exercises, there is a risk of injury. Many people have very developed arm muscles, but their strength is not very great, which is because the exercises are too easy. Engaging in easy exercises, such as increasing the number of repetitions until the muscles are fatigued or even sore, can also make the muscles develop quickly, but it has little effect on developing physical strength. From this, we can see that if the leg muscles are too underdeveloped, not only will we be unable to unleash the great physical strength of the upper body, but it will also greatly hinder the development of the upper body and even all parts of the body.</p>
<p>If we neglect leg exercises and focus solely on upper body exercises, we may have good results at the moment, but muscle development and physical strength training are not just for the present. If we neglect leg exercises, various problems will inevitably arise after a certain period of time, such as slow or even complete cessation of progress, a lean state of muscles, or the drawbacks of muscle stiffness, and an imbalance in the development of physical strength and muscles.</p>
<p>To develop muscles to the fullest extent, we must consider both light and heavy exercises, and the same applies to the legs. However, the legs are the strongest part of our body.

<h3>The Shanghai Cultural Scene Deserves Concern</h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>The bombing of Luohu in the British Concession and the coercion of the Shanghai Concessions are spicy tricks of Japanese 'political offensive'. They have stabbed the opponent's weakness and achieved initial success, using a 'misbombing' compensation of 20,000 yuan to conduct discussions on some issues; using complete empty threats to complete the conclusion of the 'Shanghai Agreement'.</p>
<p>Although such an advance cannot predict the consequences, the so-called 'Shanghai Agreement' has made the Shanghai Concessions a de facto Japanese-administered colony, a complete world of terror. The sovereignty of the Public Concession originally belonged to China, and the Municipal Council privately signed an agreement with the Japanese side, which is a disregard for our sovereignty! This is what we must resolutely oppose!</p>
<p>In this very serious situation, we are particularly concerned about the cultural circles in Shanghai. In the 'Shanghai Agreement', there is a clause that 'bans anti-Japanese newspapers', and since Japan has become the de facto master in the Concessions, it will certainly impose high-pressure bans on all progressive cultural activities. In the future, all actions of the progressive cultural circles will become very difficult. Therefore, how to sweep away this dense dark cloud is not only the task of the cultural circles in Shanghai, but also requires special attention from the national cultural circles.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, Shanghai was the main base for cultural people and the center of publishing. In terms of spreading and improving culture, Shanghai became a source of power. Not to mention the distant past, the patriotic movement in cultural thought was launched in Shanghai. This movement was simply a signal for national liberation and a prelude to the War of Resistance. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the cultural war songs of August 13 became a huge echo, followed by the planned 'evacuation' of cultural people, arranging a new national and universal development. Although the mother of cultural power has also experienced a temporary decline, the workers' hard support and active struggle soon made Shanghai culture embark on the road of rejuvenation, and a new active appearance reappeared. Especially in publishing, it still stands at the highest position. Therefore, Japan's attempt to 'conquer' the Shanghai Concessions must first target the progressive cultural circles as the primary target, because the high-speed development of Chinese anti-Japanese culture is a powerful guerrilla force against Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must use all our strength to defend the progressive cultural circles in Shanghai!</p>
<p>After observing the crisis of the isolated island of Shanghai, our eyes naturally turn here. The edge of this 'comfort zone' has been hit by Japanese bombs, and strange planes have swept over our heads. This is no longer a peaceful harbor. The treacherous waves of the Pacific Ocean will sweep this place into a 'troubled autumn'! In particular, the pursuit of compromise policies that are not up to us will at any time lay thorns on our path, so we must prepare for cutting through them.</p>
<p>Cultural workers, unite! The slogan is already ringing out. Yes, unity is strength. Collective strength is enough to overcome all difficulties. The conclusion of the 'Shanghai Agreement' between the Municipal Council and Japan gives us not only a slogan, but more importantly, practice!</p>
<p>You must know that our achievements are not as good as the authors in Shanghai, and our strength appears very weak, making us more vulnerable to setbacks. Moreover, toxins are spreading around us, so we must quickly lay a solid foundation for our joint work, and our 'fly-swatting' work must be carried out effectively!</p>

<h3>Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>The white clouds in the sky and the white snow on the ground are gradually dimming, dimming in the dusk. Between these white clouds and white snow, there is an indistinguishable expanse of white: is it clouds? The clouds and snow have been mixed by the storm, mixed into a blurred whole, and everything is losing its original shape in the haze. This is the most ordinary scenery in the frigid zone, and it becomes a strange dream that people in the tropics cannot imagine.</p>
<p>The cold here can destroy all animal and plant life. People say that the frigid zone is a terrible place, where you can freeze your hands and feet, freeze your blood, and freeze the ground until it cracks. The stories caused by the cold are based on facts. People fight against nature to conquer the cold, which also inspires their courage and wisdom. Yes, Manchuria is cold. However, if someone's birthplace is Manchuria, and they have been away from Manchuria for a long time, they will often cry out:</p>
<p>'Manchuria, my lovely hometown!'</p>
<p>At this time, Manchuria is his friend, his mother, and his lover's embrace. At this time, Manchuria is not cold, but warm. Especially for exiles driven away by iron whips, as long as he remembers Manchuria, he will become homesick and go crazy on the way to exile, and he will not hesitate to sacrifice in order to return; at the same time, for the sufferers locked within Manchuria by shackles, as long as he does not forget Manchuria, he will fight for the freedom of Manchuria until death.</p>
<p>Manchuria will always occupy people's memories; for example, the snow in Manchuria is great and holy.</p>
<p>It is the embodiment of Manchuria, the messenger of snow!</p>
<p>The bustling cities are also transformed from prosperity to decay in the wind and snow. The streets, which used to be crowded with people under the clear sky, have also become deserted open spaces. On the streets, the wandering accordion players have stopped calling for sympathy, and the impoverished beggars no longer reach out their hands from their sleeves to the passers-by; they have already begun to look for a place to spend the night in the corners abandoned or forgotten by the broken people. Everything is gradually resting. The only thing that seems to be not resting is the flag that betrayed the motherland, a not-so-strong flagpole, supporting its inevitable fate, struggling and fluttering—on the bank of the Songhua River.

<h3>We Defend Tongbai Ridge</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Our line is responsible for the defense from Gushi to Shangcheng. The 30th Division in front has already made contact with the enemy. In addition to attacking from Yejiaji Fojinshan, the main route for the enemy to capture Shangcheng is to go south from Gushi and attack the north side of Shangcheng. Twenty miles to the east is a mountainous area. The division commander pointed to the map hanging on the wall and recited: 'Tongbai Ridge, Dangjinshan, Yejiaji.' He marked the serial numbers of our troops resisting the enemy locally.</p>
<p>'Now we have entered the situation,' the division commander said, 'Everything must be extra careful and well prepared. At any time and anywhere, we may encounter enemy attacks.'</p>
<p>'The enemy's target of attack is Shangcheng, and the other is Gushi. Our area is right in the middle. Although there is no major contact in front, the position is very important.'</p>
<p>In this area, the people seem calm instead, and no one is seen running away. The war has not attracted their attention. Instead, they are taking advantage of this time to do business with the army. The cannons roar all day long, but they are not afraid. Airplanes often fly over to bomb, but they cannot see the planes, and they still return to their homes.</p>
<p>'Aren't you afraid?'</p>
<p>'Your officers are not afraid, so what are we common people afraid of!'</p>
<p>Various forms were sent down from the division headquarters, and everyone filled out one, including name, place of origin, age, mailing address, and other items. The comrades smiled as they filled them out, saying:</p>
<p>'What, is this a resume to prepare for promotion?'</p>
<p>Someone next to him immediately expressed a different opinion:</p>
<p>'You are thinking too well, you don't have that kind of luck for promotion.'</p>
<p>'In my opinion, it's to prepare for an investigation after we die in battle, right?'</p>
<p>'Yes, it must be this meaning.'</p>
<p>At the same time, an order was received from the division headquarters to remove all symbol armbands and armed belts. Regardless of officers or soldiers, all wore horizontal leather belts. Everyone was excited. This was clearly the situation on the eve of battle.</p>
<p>Everyone was rubbing their hands and stamping their feet, happy beyond measure, and a rare smile burst out from their hearts, floating on everyone's faces. Excited, nervous, and calm.</p>
<p>'Let's do it, look at this time!'</p>
<p>'Damn it, a coward is not a good man!'</p>
<p>The comrades were busy printing mimeographed battle reports and propaganda cartoons, and some people were doing the work of mobilizing the masses, so that they could understand the meaning of the War of Resistance and help the army do some things.</p>
<p>The comrades who came back from the brigade headquarters discussed going to the front to write slogans against the enemy. In the mountains less than ten miles away from the brigade headquarters, enemy plainclothes teams were already active, and they had also learned that there were six or seven hundred puppet Manchurian troops in the mountains. The slogans were prepared to be carved on tree trunks and written in large chalk letters on the walls. Those puppet Manchurian troops were our family, and we wanted to make them sober. The pre-written slogans were:</p>
<p>'Chinese people don't fight Chinese people!'</p>
<p>'Northeast brothers, unite and overthrow the Japanese militarists!'</p>
<p>'Northeast brothers, turn your guns and shoot our common enemy - the Japanese Imperial Army.'</p>
<p>'Northeast brothers do not be slaves, welcome you to bring your weapons and return.'</p>
<p>That night, at ten o'clock, the order from the regimental headquarters arrived: attack Tongbai Ridge.</p>
<p>It must be launched before twelve o'clock, and arrive at the designated location before dawn to begin the encirclement.</p>
<p>This order has finally arrived. At dawn, we must obtain a victory as bright as the sunlight.</p>
<p>This will be a great start...</p>
<h3>Creating Healthy Comic Books</h3>
<p>— Hanbo</p>
<p>Occasionally, I found several comic books with new themes on the comic book stalls, such as "Love, Tears and Blood," "Midnight Desires," "Thunderbolt," "Pearl Shirt," "Mr. Wang," and "Bull Nose." These stories, which were originally in movies and comics, have now been moved into the world of comic books one by one. From the tattered covers, it can be seen that they have been read by countless people and have etched impressions in the minds of countless people, producing a huge impact.</p>
<p>However, what is regrettable is that we have not found one or two comic books that introduce the heroic deeds of the War of Resistance or excellent anti-Japanese literature. On the one hand, they want to put on the clothes of the times, but on the other hand, they cannot get rid of the shackles of tradition. This is the new trend in recent comic books.</p>
<p>The obstacles that limit the upward development of comic books are:</p>
<p>1 A strong entertainment consciousness;</p>
<p>2 Ignoring the theme and only seeking the business tactics of being lively and pleasing the readers;</p>
<p>3 Crude artistic forms and clumsy literary explanations;</p>
<p>4 False and outdated old themes;</p>
<p>The combination of these points has formed a special department of Qiong paintings in literature.</p>
<p>Comic book merchants want to use old forms to match new themes, but they have not overcome the above-mentioned obstacles. Putting new wine into unsterilized bottles is the same old wine in a new bottle. Comic books have now entered the stage of adopting new themes. However, if we choose scripts such as horror, detective, funny, and love, there is no doubt that we will make a great mistake. Moreover, if we do not abandon the old dross, even the best themes will be misinterpreted. Therefore, the first thing we should do is to eradicate the deeply rooted bad habits of many years and use a brand-new posture to accommodate the themes suitable for the War of Resistance in non-toxic old forms and build a healthy comic book fortress. Of course, we also know that merchants have their own business tactics, but we also understand that this is a task that will not lose money. All we ask of them is a transformation. Why don't merchants stand on the side of the majority?</p>
<p>When it comes to issues such as consciousness, themes, and artistic forms, that should be the responsibility of cultural people. It is a very gratifying thing that there is a chance for comic books to change. We should have someone to lead this movement, contribute opinions, and promote its multi-faceted development, so that it does not deviate from the right path. At the same time, we must not only consider the needs of school-age children in the city, but also consider the needs of soldiers on the battlefield and the masses in the countryside. Popular pictures and texts with correct consciousness are most suitable to be used as the vanguard of articles going to the countryside and articles joining the army. Some people advocated this matter before, and now it is time to revive it urgently. From the perspective of pure literature, comic strips are also the best tool to introduce masterpieces and famous works to beginners. "Dead Souls" and hundreds of pictures gave the readers a profound impression and helped them understand the content of the original text, which was particularly powerful. This is something that current cultural drawing staff should advocate. Comic strips are the backward people of this era's culture, but if we can create a sound comic strip front, then its effectiveness will stand at the forefront of the cultural world.</p>
<h3>The Sea of Bloodshed</h3>
<p>— Rui Lin</p>
<p>Surging sea tides</p>
<p>Flow through how many lands,</p>
<p>Flow through how many days,</p>
<p>From our ancestors in ancient times</p>
<p>To our generation.</p>
<p>It flows ceaselessly</p>
<p>— This eternal life!</p>
<p>On the reefs by the sea,</p>
<p>On the beach,</p>
<p>Under the dome of the sky,</p>
<p>Rolling with roaring laughter;</p>
<p>The wind sways the evergreen grass on the ridge,</p>
<p>And in the deep seabed</p>
<p>Hides the distant dream of centuries.</p>
<p>From that time on,</p>
<p>Evil clutches stretched out from the other shore,</p>
<p>Thousands of compatriots fled,</p>
<p>When the island lost its color,</p>
<p>The sea fell silent.</p>
<p>It mourns the brave warriors who bled for their country,</p>
<p>The exiled people,</p>
<p>The lost land,</p>
<p>Now, bestiality is devouring this land,</p>
<p>In this world, where is there pure land?</p>
<p>Fresh blood records</p>
<p>The historical traces of the struggle between justice and tyranny,</p>
<p>The blood of the nation's descendants—</p>
<p>The sea is roaring,</p>
<p>It sings the praises of heroic war,</p>
<p>It sings a lament,</p>
<p>For the sacrificed warriors,</p>
<p>It gives blessings</p>
<p>To those who live for war.</p>
