<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本內外危機嚴重</h3>
<p>日本侵略者在中華民族的堅强抵抗之下，已經快兩年了。儘管侵略者及其雇傭人漢奸妥協份子，仍在極力進行一　　　的誇傲的宣傳，但是放在天下人士的面前的事實是，日本侵略者內部的和外來的危機，確已日益嚴重，牠們已經一步一步的踏上最後　　的道路了。</p>
<p>先從日本的國內情形說，第一個現象是經濟的危機的嚴重，日本晨相櫻內氏最近會經發表談話，卽稱：「日本農村，皆有人力不足之感，因農村壯丁多被徵發攻華，各地農民又多紛至軍火及其他工廠作工，農業生產瀕於絕望。同時原料缺乏，各業多有陷於停頓者！』（見五月九日各報所載路透社通訊。）我們由日本當局這篇自供，卽使不加註釋，已可想見日本農村經濟的危機，生產事業的危機，對外貿易的危機。民衆生活的危機以至侵華兵員補充等困難，是已到達如何嚴重的程度了！第二是由於上述經濟的危機，更造成階級對立的尖銳，以至侵略陣營內部鬥爭的劇烈發展。主要表親在廣大農民，輕工業，手工業工人之失業旗騷動，而軍火工業及其關係工業所　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，同時由於戰事的持久，外匯統制與進口統制的結果，更驅使一切非軍需工業與出口工商業者的恐慌，使廣大的中小資產階級被逼降落到無產者的陣營中去，這種階級分化和兩大對峙勢力之形成與發展，將如何促進日本內部危機　　　發，是不難推想的！第三，日本這種經濟的以至社會的危機，不僅存在日本本國，同時更存在於日本的屬地與殖民地，而且這種地方的危機，　　　　　　　　　　　　　，因此這種危機便表現得更加嚴重！日本當局為應付人民反戰情緒之激張與取締違反經統濟制者而定於今日（十五日）召開的全國司法會議，命令朝鮮台灣各地司法長官趕往出席，卽可想見其事態的嚴重。</p>
<p>再從國際形勢來看，日本在國際　處地位是日益低落，日益不利和日益孤立起來了。第一，民主和平各國反法西斯反侵略陣線的鞏固與發展，直接間接都帮助了全世界的援華制日運動，最近美國大平洋艦隊的全部東開，及四月份已無軍火向日輸出，（見今日報載十四日上海電華戚頓訊），英國積極增强遠東防務及新加坡海軍會議的準備，蘇聯遠東陸海軍的增防及援華運動的進展；以至英蘇，英美，美蘇合作運動的發動與進步；凡此都使日本在國際形勢更戚惡劣了。第二，是法西斯侵略者的『反共』集團，已經開始暴露其色屬內荏的眞相，雖然為對付民主和平各國的反侵略運動，而採取了更瘋狂的勾結」如最近德意軍事同盟之接洽以至德意日三國電事同盟的醞釀；同時民主和平各國偽善妥協政策的繼續存在，已給侵略集團以更加猖狂的機會，但是事實上德意所遭困難正復與日本相同，尤其是經濟方面，國此對於日本今日困難，實無任何助益之望。在這兩條戰綫對峙之中，日本雖然不能不更加走向反動的法西斯之路，以便加緊對內的搾取和對外的刼奪；但是這樣又必然更加增進日本內外危機的程度，光其是增進日本內部的騷亂。</p>
<p>日本侵略者對付這種內外危機的辦法，是採取了反動的　　的法西斯的辦法，卽對內則　　　，如最近又有全部實施總動員法及統一陸海軍的决定，和大舉捕逮反戰反經濟統制的份子，就是明顯的例子。同時不惜在國內發動第二次的『二二六』事變，以促成德意日軍事同盟，對內鎭壓中小資產者和廣大羣衆的反戰運動，對外則實行更進一步的投機冒險，如最近之加緊恫嚇英美法各國，刼奪天津與上海租界，在鼓浪嶼豋陸等。不過日本統治者這種應付內外危機的辦法，不僅不會收效，相反的還會更加增進這種危機！因此，我們敢於斷言，如果國際沒有突變，日本這種由危機深化而引發的悲喜劇還會層出不窮！</p>
<p>我們在這裏要認淸，日本侵略者內外危機的嚴重，還是我們二十二個月堅持統一戰線堅持持久抗戰的成果。也正是我們二十二個月堅决擁護中央政府一再擊敗汪精衛等「反共和平」等主張的成果。我們用二十二個月的流血鬥爭，犧牲了無數生命財產，才換得這些成果，我們絕對不能輕輕放棄！絕對不能輕輕斷送！不！我們還要鄭重指出，日本這種危機與困難還祇是開始，我們如果能够更加發揚二十二個月來的爭鬥爭精神，堅持統一戰線堅持持久抗戰，則日本的內外危機更將更加擴大與深重，同時亦必將更有助於國際形勢之有利於我，及助有於我國戰鬥力的增強與政治的進步，而有可能提前實現總反攻收復失地爭取最後勝利的時期的到來。反之，如果我們盲目的認為日本危機困難已到最後階段，如果我們因此而不再加强統一戰線，不再注力於民主政治的實施與民衆生活的改善，不再進一步發動全民族的生動力量和國際上的同情援助，則我們民族解放事業還可能遭遇空前的打擊，而實際上帮助日本侵略者解救其內外危機，這是我們全民族今日所急應警覺的。</p>
<h3>新聞紙已能自給　衢屬各縣積極改良造</h3>
<p>— 觀瀑</p>
<p>（浙江特訊）浙江衢屬各縣每年產紙數量約在五〇〇〇〇〇担右左，以地域分配，計衢縣年產約三〇〇〇〇〇担，龍游年產約一〇〇·〇〇〇担，江，常，遂壽，各縣年產約二五〇〇〇——三五·〇〇〇担。組廠之著名者。有衢縣之玉泉紙廠，四維紙廠，厚生紙廠，華南紙廠，龍游之裕民紙廠及造紙傳習所附設之改良紙廠等，年產總值約三〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，直接簡接以依為生者不下數萬人。所紙類甚多，如南屏。英尖，二五包皮，放西大京，放　京，放五千元　，六千元書·松邊·改良毛鹿等，而尤以以衛之花尖，龍游之南屏，為較著名，產量既多，又為雙書及迷信用紙所必需，內除少　在本地銷售外，以前大都運往杭州，再由杭州運到上海，再以十海為集散地，分運江蘇，靑島，及東北四省各地，自抗軍　與以來，市場大受影響，現惟取道溫州轉運上海之一條銷路耳，然就衢屬紙類產銷問題論，快點甚多，茲舉其要者；</p>
<p>（一）生產方面所產紙類名目雖多，而多不切實用，除改良毛鹿元　與松邊等，勉可供應文書之用外，其餘均品質低劣，多供箔紙燒組之用，但改良毛鹿等亦多缺點，一，產額不多，二，紙幅大小不一，不合印刷，故在生產方面所急應改進者，為（一）改進造紙技術（二）改良品質（三）統一紙幅。</p>
<p>（二）運銷方面過去邋銷區域旣因戰爭而受影響，市場又完全被上海客帮所操縱，例如龍游所產南屏紙，廿七年上海紙價平均每担八元以上，除去龍海麗水温州轉運上海之運費三元外，就地價格應為五元，然客帮收買僅出價三元，故在連銷方面應改進者為（一）推廣銷地。（二）設法免除中間商人之操縱。」使生產者與消費者，能直接交易。</p>
<p>衢紙產銷旣多缺點，故銷路逐年緊縮，而洋紙則大量傾銷，茲以衢縣為例，最近三年來兩種紙類銷數之比較如下：</p>
<p>註：（一）以上二表根據五區改良紙產銷辦事處調查</p>
<p>（二）衢紙單位為件，每件二千張，洋紙單位為令，每令千張。</p>
<p>（三）其中白報紙白有光及各色有光紙，逐年遞减，蓋因此種紙　多屬仇貨，抗戰後已予斷絕之放。</p>
<p>洋紙多屬新聞用紙，現因戰時關係供給來流斷絕，而內地之需要，却日有增加；倘衢紙能改良其品質，統一紙幅，則以前洋紙之銷路必為衢紙取而代之。固毫無疑義，故目前之問題。為生產之技術的問題，倘生產技術問題能得適當之解决，則銷路固可連帶解决。為適應此種要求，浙五區行政督察專員公署已籌備成立者。計有改良造紙傳習所，改良造紙廠。產頗辦事處，及改良紙生產合作社，卽從技術上改良入手，而連帶解决產銷問題，其經過情形頗有值得報導。而為一般之參考者；</p>
<p>造就技術人才</p>
<p>欲求造紙校術之改進，關于技術人材之造就，自為第一要務，該區於民廿七年五月一日在龍游　口　谷地方，設立第五區改良造紙傳習所，並附設改良造紙廠，以為　徒實習之用，傳習所開　費及紙廠生產，各五·〇〇〇元，合共一〇·〇〇〇元，除由省戲幾補五·〇〇〇元外，產紙名縣分別攤籌二·五〇〇元；計衢縣龍游各七五〇元？江山五〇〇元·遂安三〇〇元，病昌二〇〇元，其餘二·五〇〇元為　動賣，金，經向衢縣合作金庫息借，約定一年內（廿七·十，二五——廿八·三·五）攤還。是年七月開始招收第一期學員十四人　徒四十人，均由產紙各縣保送入所，其傳習期間定為穴個月，學員班入學資格須初中程度，授以浩紙技術，造紙應用化學，合作概論，工場管理等科目，前三個月每日科學二小時，其餘均為實習時間，後三個月則派在附設工廠賣習，以期學術並　，至藝徒班入學資格為小學畢業程度，分造料，打料，抄紙，焙紙四科，均派在附設紙廠內實地敎學，偏重於技術管理學識之養成。第一期於廿七年十二月畢業，除中途因故出所者外，畢業人數共四十人，計學員十五人，（龍游六人·遂安二人，江山四人，衢縣二人，壽昌一人，）藝徒二十五人，（龍游八人，遂安四人，江山三人，衢縣六人，壽昌四人，））皆經派囘原縣担任改良紙業技術工作。</p>
<p>設立示範紙廠</p>
<p>為對於區內各紙槽示範，並供事員藝徒實習之所，特於傳習所附設改良造紙廠，該廠現對新聞紙之製造。已有相當成就，其出品計有白報紙（現停出）綠報紙數種，生產量據統計平均為月出甲種綠報紙（長二尺四寸，寬一尺六寸五）一百二十令（每令一千騙一），茲列去年半年產產如下表：</p>
<p>月份　出品　數量</p>
<p>七八月　乙種白報紙　四五令</p>
<p>南　紙　一件（二千張）</p>
<p>甲種白報紙　三令</p>
<p>九月　甲種綠　紙　五五令</p>
<p>甲種白報紙　三令七七穴張</p>
<p>十月　甲種綠報紙　一〇四令四六張</p>
<p>十一月　甲種綠報紙　七七令九三四張</p>
<p>十二月　甲種綠報紙　一一九令三五〇張</p>
<p>合　計</p>
<p>乙種白報紙　五五令</p>
<p>甲種綠報紙　三五六令七四八張</p>
<p>甲種白報紙　二四令</p>
<p>南屏紙　一件</p>
<p>該廠所出綠報紙紳藉純熱之手藝裝成，質地甚佳，與洋紙相較毫無傀色，每令價八元七角，亦較洋紙為廉，除供本區各縣需用外，行銷浙西皖南並還　江西湖南等地，（現衢州日報徽州日報全用此綠報紙印刷）所惜產量有限，尚不能充分供給各方之需要，該廠現正計劃　尤擬於今年上半年加製包皮紙及馬　紙，下半年再加籌資金擴充產量，並督促各立成縣改良紙住產合作社，以謀大量之生產。</p>
<p>統制衢紙產銷</p>
<p>改良紙之生產技術既有相當解决，生產數量又有遞增之趨勢，如銷路不　，是亦使前功盡秦，故為謀產銷台埋化起見。於廿七年七月間成立改良紙產銷辦事處，其組成份子，為各改良紙廠，（玉泉。裕民，華南，四維，厚生，五區造紙傳習所），而由五區專員公署及衙縣，龍游二縣政府監督指導之，經費前按各廠槽數，玉泉三，厚生五，裕民二，四維二，傳習、所二。分別負担，此外尚有五區衹類運銷處之組織，緣去年四月間麗水舉行全省物產調整會議時，决定組織紙類嶺銷處，但一部份紙商及槽戶，因利害之關係，　力反對；幾經磋商，始决定五區可單喝組識運銷處，由衢，江，遂，壽，常五縣槽戶及紙商聯合組織之，而龍游又以合作社之方式，單獨經營，凡此種種，皆在統制衢紙產銷之合　化，而謀新聞紙之自給。</p>
<p>雖然吾吾對於衢屬手工業造紙之生產技術方面，尚不能認為滿意，而運銷機構方面亦當調整，但吾人認為衢紙為一種極有希望之工業，能于內地新聞紙荒』之情勢下，應時而與，裨益文化宣傳不少，而負責當局，所採之改進方針，亦甚正確，將來發展為「現代化」之一種工業，正待國民之努力耳。</p>
<h3>河源縣青年學生空前的大團結　匯成浩蕩肅奸大洪流</h3>
<p>— 林衡</p>
<p>（本報特竊）熱烈的掌聲通過了穴大議决案。</p>
<p>今天中山紀念堂，携上了新的氣象，在周圍挿着粗大的綫條配上鮮明顏色的各式各樣的國防漫畫和標語，時鐘　剛響了十一吓，禮堂裏便擠滿了一羣活潑可愛的靑年學生和小孩子，大小不同的啊吧在那裏不斷地張開唱着：「五四運動歌』，「在太行山上」，「肅淸漢奸」……墻壁被歌聲據得發抖。</p>
<p>大會開始主席報吿「五四」運動的史跡，配合着偉大的史實黨政當局和團各體的代表作了學生運動的經驗和敎訓。靑年運動的任務和方針，抗日憲奸的激昂的寶貴的演講。</p>
<p>演講過去，提案開始，首先是通電擁護四戰區張司令長官和李主席；其次是呈請當局實施戰時敎育並組織委員會來辦理其事：第三發動各校響應政府最近五十萬封慰勞信的運動號召，决定每個學生靑年每人至少寫五封以上，這次還另設代筆處發動民衆參加：第四定期本月十四日舉行河源縣軍民聯歡大會，規定了每個機關團體學校至少要派出若干代表出席；第五次决定十五至廿一日為兵役宣傳週，組織隊伍深入村農，慰問抗戰軍人家屬；第六，呈請專員公署答覆懲辦漢奸李逆道軒並沒收其財產案……這些提案皆由河源縣靑抗，工抗，少抗，縣中學生自治會，婦女會，廣東靑年抗日先鋒隊東江辦事處，靑年羣社河源分社，東江華僑服務團八大團體的統一組織——聯合座談會提出，在熱烈的長時間的鼓掌下全體通過了，這是大會成功表現，</p>
<p>匯成浩蕩的　奸大洪流</p>
<p>主席國宣佈巡行次序後，立即匯成一條浩蕩的大洪流，洪流發源於紀念堂民衆敎育館，流過祖平的街道。到了×區專員公署的門前，主席因代表着大隊向專員請示不答覆懲辦漢好李道軒，及沒收其財產案，大隊在門外高呼打倒漢奸李道軒（現任偽省府主席及第一區行政專員）及肅淸漢好的口號，接着又是歌唱和音樂的合奏，</p>
<p>「　　漢奸，　　漢好，漢奸是心腹的大息，不　淸自己的陣綫，怎救得當前的國難？』</p>
<p>「　　漢奸，　　漢奸，漢奸是心腹的大患。是出賣民族的國賊。半個也不能够放鬆。」</p>
<p>「大漢奸賣國通×，小漢奸賣身做狗，中漢奸投降做賊，準漢奸妥協求和。</p>
<p>「……。」</p>
<p>「各位親愛的靑年朋友」專員公署秘書開始給大隊答覆了，『各位救國的高度的熱情是非常可嘉的，特別是肅淸好情緒的熱烈和積極更加值得欽佩……在前次河源各界　奸大會上通過呈請政府懲辦漢好李道軒並沒收其財產案，我們已請示省府了，在省府還沒有覆示之前，我們還是服從政府命令的，晚上我們再急電省府請示然後答覆各位好吧，請原諒……」</p>
<p>得到了完滿的答覆之後，大隊再用整齊步伐揚唱起激昂的歌聲，走過了大街和小巷，高舉起激昂的鐵拳，喊出：「加緊團結，長期合作，抗戰到底」的呼聲，在這樣抗日情緒的高漲下，整个个羣衆從商店民房中走出來觀光，有些更被吸引到大隊裏來，巡行的隊伍强大起來了。</p>
<p>大隊走了十字街口的民衆時事演講台，台上還備下河源各界　奸運動週的痕跡，　　開了肅奸大會，接着在演講台上每晚演出肅奸的　劇和反好的演講，河源掀起了肅奸的巨浪！巨浪警吿了許多漢奸！</p>
<p>大隊走到了漢奸李道軒新屋的門前，羣衆的緒情更高了要求將屋毀去，經過主席團會議議决了，在未得到政府指示之前，我們不應有任何過激的舉動，以示靑年對政府誠意的擁護和尊重，終於僅將門前的「芳牌」拆落來，由大隊抬著走，尚到縣抗×後援會去了。</p>
<p>研究經驗和敎訓</p>
<p>為着檢討今天大會，巡行及研究「五四」運動的經驗敎訓，主席團决定召集擴大座談會，在熱烈的討論之後，主席總吉了經驗和敎訓：</p>
<p>第一，「五四」運動表現了知　份子，偉大的愛國熱情和英勇犧牲的鬥爭精神，這偉大的運　推動了中國革命運動向前發展，同時也就是暴露了知識份子沒有革命持久性的最大的弱點，這弱點便是「五四」運動失敗的主要原因，這一點警惕加强着我們月前的靑年運動應當怎樣的堅持奮鬥加强努力！</p>
<p>第二，「四五」運動是學工商自發的反日反漢奸的民埃統一戰線，這自發的民族統一戰線在當時反賣國賊和拒絕簽字巴黎和約的勝利，是起了决定的作用，同時正因為這自發的民族統一戰綫還存在着沒有廣大的羣衆基礎，不够擴大和鞏困的嚴重弱點，使「五四」運動不能得到澈底，勝利！這經騐敎訓了我們目前應當加緊鞏固和發展抗日民族統一戰綫，這才能給最後勝利以有力的保證。</p>
<p>第三，由於當時國內的分裂，不能抵抗　　、×寇利用一以華制華」的陰謀來破壞我國團結，而　到他那不勞而獲的勝利，現在抗戰快進入第二期更困難的階段，×寇也正在加緊利用漢奸…逆親日派等到處破壞團結的時候，我們應該擁護團結，堅持一切抗日力量的長期合作，廣大地展開肅好運動。</p>
<p>第四，李道軒之所以成為漢奸並不是偶然的事情，他有一貫的反覆無常的機會主義的作風，他是一個最自私自利的份子，一向包辦走私與×直接來往而定上漢奸之路，在東江目前走私最勝行的時候我們得警惕一切走私的份子。</p>
<h3>拉丁化新文字是一個最理想的推行生活教育運動的工具　……讀了陶行知先生的「告生活教育社同志書」之後</h3>
<p>— 渥·丹</p>
<p>在四月廿和廿一日的香港申報上，讀了陶行知先生的，吿生活敎育社同志書，過是給我們帶來正確的指導和鼓勵。陶先生提倡的生活敎育運動，已經十二年了。生活敎育的種于掃遍了全中國。新安旅行團是個例子，各地的中華　餘學校是個例子。而且陶行知先生的敎育理想和方法：則知則傳，行知知行，已經變成今日一般救亡工作者的座右銘了。</p>
<p>在這里，陶先生又指出；　　　　我們在這十二年當中幹了些什麼事，三件事，這有沒做完，一是反化洋育，二是反傳統敎育，三是在　　　半封建的國家，肆立爭取自由平等的敎育的理論與方法。</p>
<p>而在這三件事中，為了要楊　前面的那二件事。第三件事；建　爭取自由平等的敎育的理論和方法，那麼，消極的反對是徒勞的，不會達到目的。所以，他又說；</p>
<p>三民主義是我們的工作的最高指導，從一個半　　地半封磁的劉家變或為一個自由平等的民有民治民亨的國家之重要軍事政治，經濟教育幾方面配合起來才能達到。</p>
<p>因此，陶先生又指示着！敎育方面必定要具備幾個條件：</p>
<p>第一，敎育必須是戰鬥的，是民族，人　解放的武器。</p>
<p>第二，敎育必須是生活，一切敎育必須通過生活才有效。</p>
<p>第三，敎育必須是科學的：要根據客觀情形不斷地把它研究出具體的方法來，而且內容要包括自然科學和社會科學的，</p>
<p>第四，敎育必須是大衆的。</p>
<p>第五，敎育必須計割　。要有一個計劃使人力財力都有一個緩急輕重的分配。</p>
<p>在第四點七，是淸晰地指明敎育最終極的目的是大衆的，不應該是少數人的，但是，且看我們廣大的同胞還有百分之八十以上是亮　睛的瞎子，文盲和無知，是我們抗戰的一個大碍礙可！</p>
<p>在都　奮等四十三人在第三次國民參政會議上的一個「動員全國知識份。掃除文盲普及民埃意識以利抗戰建國案』的提案中，詳明地說到：</p>
<p>『掃除文盲普及民族意識以增加廣大民衆對於抗戰建國之認識與　卯，實為動　民衆中所應急起直追的工作。</p>
<p>而且，在這里更有一個對中國文盲衆多的統計：</p>
<p>「我國人口假定估計有四萬萬五千萬（根据海關十七年估計）其中除一歲到十六歲（屬於嬰孩，兒童義務敎育及民衆補習敎育的範圍），及四十七歲至六十歲，約佔人口百分之五十外，其餘自十七歲辛四十六歲約佔全人口之百分五十，卽二萬萬二千五百萬人，其中文盲約達百分之八十，卽一萬萬八千萬人。此一萬萬八千萬人，均為國民中之壯年，卽　大民衆之中堅，處此抗戰建國之非常時期，為應付當前事變與噌强國力計，實為迅速提高其文化水準之迫切需要」。</p>
<p>並且在這個提案中又詳細列舉各種具體的方案，切實施行的辦法共有六項。（見戰時敎育，四卷二期的專載，）</p>
<p>在這里我們以為：若我們能採用拉丁化新文字以施行，需除文盲，鞏固民衆的抗日民　意識，和文化水準的提高，定能加速的實現。所以在施行提案中列舉六個辦法時有二個問題值得考慮。</p>
<p>第一，就是怎樣使百份之八十不識字的同胞能够很快的獲得文字工具來武裝頭腦。爭取知識解放。鞏固抗戰的　饑，增强抗戰建國力量。</p>

<h3>由舊軍隊到新軍隊　——王靖國將軍訪問記</h3>
<p>— 曹珒</p>
<p>【民革晉西通訊稿】久駐第×戰區之某軍，最初即開入晉北，守轉里，戰忻口，將士用命　奏奇功，而損失重大，迨太原退出之後，舊有部屬，傷亡已趨十之七八，權又轉　晉西，致力于新補充，新統御，新訓練，新戰法，並乘徐州侖戰之際。向×反攻，當卽克復柳林要鎭。與　石，中陽之×，相持不下者已十閱月，中經去秋柳林一役，活用新戰法，×負創遁去，未敢再犯。晉×日來復以四路犯靜樂，某軍乃配台友軍，于日前攻克交口——按交口鎭為太軍公路通中陽之交又點，形勢至為重要；捷報傳來，羣情歡　，記者去訪將軍于某地，深致祝賀慰問之意，得議將軍簡述該軍作戰來之經驗，幷謂：「初期之失敗，不足驚訝；今後之勝利，正在意中」。鎮定堅毅，誠不失大將風度。所述該軍戰史，亦頗足代表整個民族革命戰爭之一般，爰介紹如次：</p>
<p>第一期　陣地戰之敗退</p>
<p>「本軍第一期作戰，卽由準備入同會戰，担任雁門關正面防務，後戰局轉變，退守縣，掩護我後方兵力集中忻口，任務相當完成，實力已損失殆半，經整頓後又返忻口作戰，經此兩役，士兵傷亡十之七八，營長亦傷亡大半，×位團長，僅余一人，陣地戰之烈，傷亡之驚人，實十餘年來之積怕得所發洩，激動以至於此。</p>
<p>退出太原之後，于陽縣補充×個獨立旅，去賽，×人避開韓侯嶺，對臨汾取兩翼包圍，本軍倉卒開大麥郊右口之　接防，雖曾稍挫×人，惟損失重大，傷亡失散者達四千人，而量英勇之某旅長，亦于是役成仁殉國。』</p>
<p>第二期　運動戰與游擊</p>
<p>臨汾不守之後，開始劃分防區，幷習用游擊戰與運動戰，而主要交通綫全為×人所盤據，有此事實上之困雞與需要，本軍雖不諳新戰法，亦頗勇于試驗。當時×于八路圍攻吉縣之後，復繼讀深入，六路圍攻我石樓，擬搗我司令部，纏找機動撤出，×權犯永和，遭我猛華。×撤退至毛芝山時，又中我伏擊，于此二投，×我傷亡，比例倒轉；井　獲大量戰利品，繼將關縣，石樓，大寧收復，此以十氣旺盛，幷不以戰術上一時之撤退為潰敗之所致。新烈戰術之運用難為初試，于此亦足證其効力之宏偉。幹部認識因之加强，更不復疑感「四新敎育」（註：卽新補充，新統御，新訓練，新戰法）之于公無利，于已有損。</p>
<p>為配合徐州會戰，我軍一致取採攻勢，本軍首先攻克軍渡，柳林，更不時襲擊　石，中陽之×，均有小勝，士氣大壯，已培植下客歲九月間柳林勝利之基礎，該時×正進攻武漢，苦不得手，為牽掣我軍兵力計，乃揚言進犯我大西北，其中一路卽進攻軍渡，作試渡棲樣。</p>
<p>先是×增兵汾，離，約五六千之數，由大武北向，佯攻臨縣，我察知其奸乃先期派隊出擊，×亦囘兵應戰，我于正面略與週旋，卽撒入兩側山地，×以狂傲之師，直抵軍渡，唯以處處受我夾擊，旋卽撤囘柳林，並搏攻大寧，我司令部所在地，北面我軍則乘機襲入柳林，斃×聯隊長一，及兵站副司令一。×復回兵北攻，無目標砲轟二日，南面我軍又進迫柳林，×据城不出，我南北兩翼復同時反攻，柳，離交通綫行被我控制，×乃秦城遁去，我緊壓追擊，于離石城西，　之某地，與×相持，又于去「雙十二」紀念日及，三日——南京失陷紀念之時，×又陸空聯合，犯我柳林，我已有第一次之輕騐。預安善佈置。于側前方二高地設伏，主力集中後方正面，作成從深配備，×貿然壓入殼中，經我三面夾擊，素屍五百餘具，潰竄而去，我軍傷亡僅八九十人。去年底，×復衝攻吉縣，北路由中央進攻石樓之×，經柳林我軍壓迫，卽中途折回。近日來，×出四路圍攻靜樂，由　石經大武，×約四五千，本軍乃乘機克復交口，並毀×碉堡工事六處，刻正分向離石中陽搜索前進中，從不能一一收復，亦可致意×人，勿作西進妄圖。</p>
<p>第三期　勝利的反攻</p>
<p>王軍長講述旣　，記者復以　區目前形勢，及前途展望相叩詢，軍長掌予詳加分折謂：「以地理形勞，及我方　力之　備觀之，該路×人如不能增達五萬以上，絕不敢進窺陝北，揆之目前戰局，×已無力深入，反圖鞏固其佔領地域，拖長相持階段，我必隨時予以打擊，速其崩潰，早日進入反攻階段，至反攻形勢究為若何，今日亦無須空論，明年此時，當能補叙。」</p>
<h3>日機濫炸平民　美向日提抗議　國際反侵略會華分會　電總會報告×機×行</h3>
<p>【中央社華盛頓十三日電】赫爾國務卿頃向各報發表談話、略謂、日本飛機森炸重慶、汕頭、寧波、福州各地後、美駐日大使格　、已向日政府提出口頭抗議、此舉乃本諸向來所具態度、質言之、卽凡以飛機轟炸普通人民之舉、均為美政府所讀責是也、</p>
<p>【中央社重慶十四日電】國際反侵略述動大會中國分會、為使世界民衆更能明瞭×人之×行、及促進其對×日之制裁起見、經將歷次×機襲渝實情、電吿日內瓦反使略總會、特別指出×人之卑劣手段。實為其愈戰愈弱之表現、此種手段、不獨毫無效果、而我國民衆對×人殘×之眞面目，更有深刻之認識、同仇敵愾之情緒，反益高漲、抗戰到底之决心、愈覺堅强、分會並懇總會設法促進巴黎反對轟炸不設防城市大會各項議案之實施、及加强對×之有效制裁云、</p>

<p>— 徵波</p>
<p>【大陸社重慶特快訊】全國生產會議、在孔院長領導下、於本月十日舉行開　、十三日圓滿閉幕、出席各部會長官、機關代表，各項專家一百二十餘人、提案分（一）農業、（二）工業、（三）續業、（四）交通、經濟及其他、共三百六十餘件、俱屬切合戰時環境之需求、而為完成抗戰建國大業之先急者、集全國農、工、　、財、經濟專家。於×機大肆茶　後之悲慘環境中、聚首一堂、孜孜屹屹，以最誠懇最熱烈之熊度、從事於增加全國生產，培植國力之研究和計劃、大會中充滿精神團結、努力邁進之精神、而一片一片融和氣象、尤足以表示中國前途之光明、</p>
<p>生產會議之召集、實為檢討過去工作、策進將來生產、其意義之重大、試如大會宣言所云，「抗戰建國、兼籌幷進、為中央旣定之國策、現代國家以經濟敎育武力三者為基礎，戰爭之勝負、决于經濟力量之持久供給、又為總裁昭示之明訓，軍與以來、我國之軍事實力、愈戰愈强，今日之要政、端在發展全國生產、使國家經濟實力日益充實、能與此强大之民族武力相配合、以爭取抗戰之勝利、與樹立建國之基礎，」</p>
<p>大會開幕第二日、蔣總裁親臨致訓、對各會員跋涉長途、千里赴會之犧牲、為國精神、表示欽佩、而于生產與節約之重慶，尤為訓示周詳、闡發至再、總裁對經濟建設、資源集中，交通發展、人力利用各點、均有很透澈賅明之指示、幷以利用學術研究、為生產增加之努力、相島相期于出席各會員、總裁出席敎訓時、精神極佳、全體會員、咸表快慰、而對總裁世罕與近之偉大人格、尤費感動不置、</p>
<p>大會宣言經于最後一次會議時通過、俟略加修正後、卽可全部發表，以供政府施政之參考、與全國同胞之研討、大會認為中國經濟建設、會經數十年之努力、而大效未影者、實有兩個主要原因、「第一在國民政府成立以前，雖略有建設而無計劃、第二在國民政府成立以後、雖有計劃而又牽于內憂外患、亦未能長足淮展、抗戰耽興、全國統一、內憂旣已消釋，外患亦陷泥沼，今後中國經濟政策，一自應絕對以民生主義為依歸、以解决國民生活之正當需要為鵠的、尤須發展國家資本，扶助私人企業、提倡合作運動、同時防止資本集中、使生產事業國家化、民主化、合理化、以奠定新中國之建設基礎，與培植全民族之經濟實力，抗戰建國、為民族安危與亡之所關、政府應本軍事第一、勝利第一、國家至上、民族至上之原則、將全國生產力量，統盤籌劃、務使各種軍民必需物品、大量生產、源源不絕、以適應國防之需　而增强抗戰之實力、關於產品之種類照質量、尤應有整個籌算、各種生產事業間、更須有緊密的連緊、使整個國家經濟生產、一成為有系統有組織之機動整體、民族復興之根據、旣在西南西北之腹地、于是後方經濟建設、乃為刻不容緩之要圖、戰前國家之經濟重心在東南，在戰後若干年之內、國家之經濟重心、將在西南、故令日後方之經濟建設、皆須出以有計劃之籌算、本會同人認為今後國家整個生產政策、應以西南經濟建設為中心原則之一、自當為全國上下所共認也、』</p>

<p>此在抗戰期間、較之其他各種集會性質、更為重要、意義也特別深長，蓋抗戰工作所需于物力的供應、至為浩繁、而最近勝敗的關鍵、尤視經濟物質之能否長期支持、所以蔣委員長說、「現代戰爭為國與國間、人力、物力、財力組和之决賽，其經濟物質、能為持久供給者，卽能得最後之勝利』、一年餘來、×人對我經濟金融之破壞、無所不用其極、幸賴政府之努力應付，及人民之熱心維護、內地經濟建設仍　賡續　行，而法幣信用、且日超鞏固、最近華北偽幣價格、一再慘跌、×人雖用盡種種手段、希圖挽救，終于一籌草展、須知偽幣與×幣為同一集團、偽幣價格的慘跌、卽等于×幣價格的慘跌、準此以觀、我國在經濟方面、已經戰勝×人、倘能再接冉厲、努力生產、在物力上財力上、不斷的供給、不斷的增強、則抗戰必能操勝利之　券、建國不難達成功之境城、自抗戰軍興以來、政府鑒于戰爭消耗之鉅大、國家物力之艱難、一方提倡節約、以　減少不必要的消費、一方獎勵生產、其發資源，以資補充、所有國內公路生產事業、無不竭力提倡扶植、以减除開困難、充實其力量、增加其效率、諸如協助工廠遷移、舉辦農工貨欶、津助生產資本等事、俱以最大的努力與最大的勇氣以赴之，並為運用便捷收效迅速起見、除由主管各部督促辦理外，復增設農產促進委員會，工業合作　　等機關、從事於生產工作、惟是提倡雖力、其成效如何，尚須有一番詳密的檢討、以期補偏救弊、而為合理順適的發展、所以本會召集的目的、就是要「檢討過去工作、策進將來生產」、現在再就這兩個目標、提出幾點意見、　供諸位的參　、</p>
<p>第一，生產計劃的確立。關於國家經濟建設、總理已有詳切之指示、吾人自當奉為圭果、努力以求其實現，今日所當請求者、厥在一方面在應目前的需要、增加各種必要的生產、以充實抗戰的力量、他方面遵照遺敎、確立百年大計、以奠定建國的基礎、抗戰以來、政府所注意者計有三事、一為區域經濟計劃的釐訂、二為國營事業與私營事　的配台、三為農　經濟的救濟、我國地大物博、隨處可謀大量的生產、但天然環境與生產事業的互相配台、要亦多有彼善於此抉擇優劣的餘地、故於經濟的發展計劃進行之後、自應力加矯正、現在政府已斟酌西南各省的資源及交通、决定在四川境內、選擇　當地點，為第一期要發展的工業區域從事於煤礦煤油及煤汽的開採、並已設立酒精廠、發電廠、化學工廠等、尚在計劃中，製鐵造紙廠及擊糖廠等、此種區域經濟計劃之簽訂、為目前經濟建設中的大要點，在民生主義的建國嶺則下、節制私人資本，預防少數資本家壟斷市場、把持金融，是必要措施、所以政府經濟　設計劃、係遵照總理遺敎重工業及國　工業、以國營為原則、輕工業以政府獎勵民營為原則、現在國內主要的交通工具、早已收區憾有、規模較大的礦區，尤其有關國防工業及重工業的礦區、亦已劃為國營　區、不過私人事業方面、也必須竭力提倡扶植、以期分工合作、配台幷進、故政府近來對於公司法之修正、私人企業的獎勵、官　合作等問題、均特訓注意、至於農村經濟救濟、在戰前卽已密切注意、如推進　村合作、農業試驗及設立農本局等、早已在積種進行、戰事發生以來，農本局的工作，更，重於西南各省，如設立縣合作金庫、舉辦農業　庫投資、農田水利、購買棉花棉紗棉布食糧運藏後方等工作、已有長年發展、今後當繼續努力、以收普遍之效、惟此類計劃、是否完善、關係於事業前途者，至重且大、亟應斟酌社會情形、根據個人經驗、鎭密檢討、而於下列二事、尤當特別注意、</p>

<p>這次大會提案分農業工　　業交通經濟及其他各案共達三百六十餘件，會議結果，多有適要的决定，對於抗戰建國前途，必能有重上貢献，大會宣言中特別引遠術委員長訓詞，『現代國家以經濟敎育武力三者爲基礎」「戰爭之勝負决於經濟力量之　久供給』，而堅决主張：『發展全國生產，與强大之民族武力相配合，以爭取抗戰勝利與榭立建國基礎』，這是今後中國生產運動與經　建設事業的基本原則，也是應爲全國民衆竭誠擁護的原則。</p>
<p>我們所要在這里欲致其熱誠與期望的，第一是政府當　與生產事業關係者，今後必須遵照這個基本原則，切實，認眞，排除　　，勇往邁進，務使完全達到使生產事業爲堅持持久抗戰與建立三民主義共和國而服務的　髙目標。其次，我們爲要切實達到這個最髙目標而擴大生產運動，决不能僅僅依恃政府機關和少數資本與若干專家的力量，主要的還要發揮全國人民的自動性與積極性，使能爲　大生產運動而奮鬥到底，卽是要做到集中人才與集中人力兩點·這裏，首先就有賴於　淸過去官僚主義與　善事業的陋習·冺除黨派，系統奥門戶的觀念與成見，大胆的大量的擢引確具正確的政治認識與鬥爭精神而經驗學識兩皆豐富的靑年幹部。同時，還要普遍地切實地給予從事擴大生產運　的所有成員以民主的權利，生活的改善，和享受戰事生產的敎育政治敎育與集體學習的機會。</p>
<p>此外，前昨兩日本報社評版刊載的「加緊生生，堅持抗戰」一文，也是我們今後從事於擴大產產運動者的至可珍貴的參攷資料，希望不要輕忽置之。</p>

<h3>向着一個共同的目標前進　全港話戲界宣誓</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>五百餘戲劇工作者昨晨在普慶舉行</p>
<p>這是在偉大號召之下的偉大行動。</p>
<p>全港四十多個戲劇團體、五百多個戲劇工作者、沉默地坐在普慶戲院的中間，與往日化裝在舞合上活躍，在他位上剛好是掉轉過來·</p>
<p>中救，中藝，中旅的時代，廣東劇場香港靑年戲協……藝人畢至，濟濟一堂，中救的整齊的制服和襟章特別醒目，中藝中旅很多男女朋友特別引人注意亦。</p>
<p>舞合上佈置簡單堂皇，陳策，鍾天心，和主席團歐陽予倩·胡春冰，金山·鍾啓南·黄凝霖·譚國恥·李化·盧敦·唐槐秋什表龔家寶等坐成一個弓形，唐槐秋跟他團員坐在下面，</p>
<p>準於上午九時開會·由姜明司儀，行禮及國民公約宣誓照着秩序嚴肅地進行着。</p>
<p>主席胡　冰先生致開會詞，首先說明精神總動員意義，次述戲劇工作者的時代任務·最末是愷切地協勉大家用一分一秒的時間用一點一滴的血汗，貢献於民族解放運動的最後勝利。——是胡先生的實際行動的表現·可知道他是這個信念的篤行者·</p>
<p>中委陳策引伸我×在軍事上，政治上，外交上，經濟上……的比較，證明最後勝利必屬於我。</p>
<p>天心先生講的是故事：廣州撤退時，鍾先生率領一千多個靑年往內地工作。有十一個小孩子——從九歲至十五歲，都是家庭很好的小學生——隨隊出發。到了羅定將轉到韶關的時候，因爲懷疑小孩子的力量，就勸阻小朋友的長征。小朋友竟答以「蔣委員長說，地無分南北東西，人無分男女老幼。小孩子亦有小孩子的工作。』大人們深受感動，終於給他們跟着。從羅定韶關步行了十二天，小朋友的精神非常健旺，在韶關工作，到處就使人深深感動。小朋友何以有這樣遠勝大人的力量呢？就是小朋友的精神動員早已有了决心，小朋友演劇的成績出人意料之外。從此可知道精神動員與戲劇的重要性，根據這個具體的例子，說明這次聯合戲劇工作者舉行國民公約宣誓的意義。</p>
<p>接着就說；抗戰後一變窮仰僻壤的舊　觀最大的力量就是戲劇。動員民衆是爭取最後勝的重要條件，動員工作現在還是做得不够，有有賴於戲劇工作者之努力者又多。內地展開戲劇工作非常困難，導演，劇本……一切都發生』問題，在香港却非常使利，希望大家予以援助。——這是很實際的說話，報以一陣熱烈的掌聲。中救的攝影師，在會場穿來走去忙個不了，他們是準備把祖國的光榮　到南洋去，宣慰僑胞。</p>
<p>演講似乎有至此爲止的趨勢，大家依依要留住這個空前的大集會似的，掌聲一響，中救團長金山先生開始着緊張會場空氣的演講了。</p>
<p>『第一，精神動員要繼之以團結與組織；凡是反漢好的都可以姑在一起團結起來。今天的大集合，就是團結的表示，組織的開始，第二，今天的宣誓別讓它成爲興奮謝，還要澈底地堅持下去。最末，他很懇切地說：我們中救朋友，願隨諸位之後，誓死爲抗戰而奮鬥到底。』——眞情實感表現在戲劇就是有內容的好戲：表現在演講就是有內容的好演詞。</p>
<p>因此，打開歐陽予請先生的話匣了</p>
<p>『金山同志說的團結很要緊。這次黄花崗的演出就是團結的象微。各他劇團因爲歷史。經濟，及領導人的性格，各有不同，有的是出奇制勝的，有的是按步就班的，有的是緊張地幹，有的是穩健地幹。只要朝着抗戰建　的共同目標，作風，方式縱有不別，是不要緊的。我們應該以身設地，不可提過的標準去權量一切。比如有人在上海演出某二　戲，他是受到了警吿，不容易再演上去的，你要是再根據一個太髙的標準，批評這樣的演出還是不够，豈不是使人灰心—把自己淸髙自居而看不起別人，與從前的象牙之塔又有何不同！</p>
<p>關於補充鍾先生的話，歐陽先生亦說得好：</p>
<p>在香港發展話劇是很困難的。我們希望大家有統一的組織，在一個公共場所，可以練習歌詠，練習排劇，沒有分別彼此。到那時候，我們在香港就可以成爲一個供應站，補充的導演，劇本……種種的需要，我們這些戲劇工作者一定是供不應求的。——這是實在的情形。歐陽先生還根據客觀事實說：我們現在的話劇巳經勝於日本了，就是搬到歐美去，亦不見得有遜色。我們千萬不可放鬆我們的工作。戲劇是集體的藝術，戲劇運動應該是集體的行動。</p>
<p>鍾啓南先生有感於中，遂卽站起來說：『目前所需要的是行動來表現，需要一倘集體的行動。在座三分之二甚來自內地的。我們在這　舒舒服服，不可忘記內地的困難與痛苦』。合場空氣越來越緊張，掌聲的意思好像是要龔家　君演講，他亦義不容辭地，代表中旅及唐　秋先生說。</p>
<p>『今天的團結精神很受感動，在這可　狀况之下，希望一團結一致要眞心誠意，二，刻苦耐勞，來爭取最後的勝利』又是　以一陣熱烈的掌聲，</p>
<p>胡春冰先生最末來一個總結：偉大的任務擺在我們的目前。我們要先動員自己去動員民衆：我們需嬰集體的行動來展開活劇運動，今天，是一個偉大任務的開始。</p>
<h3>汕頭××　販賣人口猖獗　多以難婦難童為對象　運往海峽殖民地等埠</h3>

<h3>出錢，出力　生活合唱團昨演奏</h3>
<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>響應募集短衣褲運動</p>
<p>本報特寫——『生活合唱團』是　仔『生活中學』主辦的一個業餘歌唱團體。</p>
<p>他們明白的，在這樣的時候，『爲歌詠而歌詠』是可　的一回事：歌詠或許是你底最好的技能，那末你便要用這種技能幹出有利國家社會的事；這樣，你底技能才有價值，才有意義。</p>
<p>他們也用過他們底合唱技能這樣幹過點事，他們參加過義演，做過街頭劇，……可是獨　歌詠戲劇演奏會，昨晚在孔聖堂舉行的還是破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>這次他們是給，『廣東各界慰勞會』募集短衣褲，贈送前方浴血將士的，他們的開會辦法這裏値得介紹一下：據他們底特刊登出的啟事說，『本團這一次演奏所收入的欵項，都是全數撥與廣東各界慰勢會的，至於因演奏而開銷的一切費用，完全由本團同人自己拿出來……』——</p>
<p>好，好，好，旣也錢又出力，是幹　賑工作的好模範，倘若大家都是這樣去幹，籌賑工作效率必定加倍。</p>
<p>昨晚演出的各項節目，雖然『初試啼聲』，但也很有可觀，合唱方面很熟練，『八百壯士』，『大軍進行曲』，一滿江紅』，一最後勝利是我們的』，『　　　　』『……幾隻都唱得很好。</p>
<p>吳紫鄉獨唱『歸不得故鄉』。唱得很婉轉，她博得一陣熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>劇的演出有兩個獨幕劇。第一個『兩個傷兵』，寫軍民合作的故事。做來多中規矩。</p>
<p>第二個『訊號響了一，寫游擊區裏，一個父親和子女響應義勇事起事殺×的故事，父親雖然因事發，受傷殉國，兒女們還踏着老父的光榮的血跡，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　』</p>

<p>婦女兵災會主辦的閨秀名流義演賑災各主角，昨宵又實地演習那套『紅樓夢』的『寶釵撲蝶』，由辛家網球三傑之一的辛慕韞小姐飾薛寶釵，明眸皓齒，端莊淑雅，勝任愉快。任演習中用着織纖的玉手，拿着一把紙扇子，忽　忽右忽前忽後的撲去，像是舞台上有活的蝴蝶飛來一樣。她的姿勢活潑得很，能够左右書觀衆們的視綫，眞不慚是一個聞名的女體育家。</p>
<p>繼續表演『史湘雲醉眠芍藥』一幕，由港紳簡英甫先生女弟簡明小姐飾史湘雲婷婷玉立。嬝　動人。那天寶玉請喝壽酒，史湘雲喝酒特別起勁，爛醉如泥，睡在芍藥叢中那石磴子上，四面芍藥花飛，頭臉襟上紅香亂散。簡小姐表演至酒醉方醒，惺松的當兒，姣酈不勝，爲一得意的傑作。</p>
<p>「十二金釵拜壽」一幕，不論正釵和副釵，遴選演員都特別的嚴格，經過四個月頭演習之後，藝術成就、才决定他們有了入選的資格。其中如飾紫鵑的羅　素小姐，嬌小玲瓏，聰慧活潑，尤爲卓超羣倫。原來羅小姐是香港敎育司視學官羅仁伯先生的　五女公子，現方　業於意大利嬰堂，好學不倦，每試輒冠　　，對於音樂和跳舞　衛，尤有湛深的研究呢！</p>

<h3>掃除文盲，普及教育最有效的工具　新文字運動的動態　港新文字學會主辦新文字訓練斑</h3>
<p>— 夥兮</p>
<p>特　新文字的認識</p>
<p>中　拉丁化是用拉丁字母拚寫中國話的一種拚音文字；所以又叫拉丁化中國字，或稱漢字拉丁化，又稱拉丁化新文字。無論在學理上，在實際上，已經證明新文字是　除文盲，普及敎育的工具了。比方我們來說一句；『我們現在來研究新文字』的話，用新文字寫起來就是；WOMN　XIANZAI　LAI　IANGIU　SIN　MENZ這是多麼事半坊諳的辦法！</p>
<p>根據着文字發展的規律，無論那二國的文字，沒有不是從象彩表意的階段，進化到拚音的階段；就是漢字亦不是例外。事實吿訴我們，中國的漢字，早已漸潮說離了象形表意的階段而進到形聲和轉注的那種表音階段了。</p>
<p>蔡元培，孫科先生等七百餘人，對於推行新文字有了這樣的意見，「中國現階段最重的工作是普及民挨自　的敎育，我們要動員一切工具來進行這個工作。但是在選擇工具的時候，我們是必得指出新文宇特大的效力。文字好　是交通媒介，漢字好比是獨輪車，國語羅馬子好比是火輪船，新文字好比是飛機。坐上新文字的飛機來傳　民族自救的敎育的時候，就可以知道新文字是不但不阻　中國統一　而且確有力量帮助喚起大衆。挽救我們的垂危的祖國』，此外，如魯迅，郭沬若，陳鶴琴先生等，亦都是推行新文字的先進，這是稍爲關心文化運動者所周知的事實，因爲這是中國新文化的曙光。</p>
<p>懷疑與進化</p>
<p>新文字旣然有了這樣的價値，爲什豳還有些人懹疑它呢？</p>
<p>第一，就是覺得幾千年來傳下來的國粹——方塊字——棄之實在可惜。其實站在新文字的觀點看來，固然是反對把漢字看做萬古不變神聖不可侵犯的文宇靈物崇拜者的頑固主張，但亦反對髙喊廢除漢字的過左的主張。</p>
<p>我們認爲文字不過是一種工具，他的發展是跟着社會經濟政治的發展而發展的，在拚音化中國字沒有產生之前，漢字也是在不斷的發展變化以求適合在發展進步中的社會的需要，而拉丁化中國字和九十年來每一種拚音由中國字的方案，也無非是它一　的發展上的一種形態，漢字本身自有它存在的歷史價値，旣用不到廢除也决不會廢除，即使在拉丁化中國字普遍流行的將來，漢字也將依舊爲人們所學習作爲研究中國古代學術思想的主要工具。</p>
<p>第二，就是惡憎及笠的固執成見——有些人，以為從前提倡新文字者是跟他們政見不同，是他所不諒解者，因此，運對方所用的文化工具，亦懷疑起來，否認起來，正如從前的木刻　與歌泳未曾給人看到它的本來面目一樣。</p>
<p>會發生以上兩種懷疑的原因亦就是沒有詳細研究新文字究竟是何物。社會是進化的，『事實』會給偏狹者不得不虛心：不懂得新文字者將會漸漸懂得新文字了。</p>
<p>呈請政府頒令推行新文字的先聲</p>
<p>八年來，我國各地對於推行新文字已有風起雲湧之勢。就廣東而論，廣州話拉丁化及潮州話拉丁化亦都表現了突進的姿態。『八一三』之後，上海工部局敎育處長，我國著名敎育家陳鶴琴博士等在難民牧容所推行新字成績尤卓著。現在，上海新文字報紙，刊物，大衆讀物，亦如雨後春笋一樣幼發起來，</p>
<p>上海教育學會，以新文字試驗確著成效。在重慶全國敎育會議上，遂有這樣的提案，</p>
<p>『我國文字艱深文盲衆多，過去用種種方法，推行識字敎育，證明在最短時間，不易收効，長此以往，文盲一日不消除，文化水準永無提髙之希望，査拉丁化新文字在國内推行有年，成幼卓著，最近在上海難民收容所裏試驗，結果非常圓滿，平素不識字之難民學習一月，卽能閱讀，學習二月，卽能書寫，收効之速，遠勝直接敎授漢字，際此抗戰建國時期，掃除文盲，以增强抗建之力量實爲刻不容緩之舉，』</p>
<p>——新文字的前途，從此透露着它的曙光了。</p>
<p>本港新文字運動的動態</p>
<p>本港新文字學會爲知名大學敎授及語言學專家所組織之學術團體。二月前向英政府辦妥立案手續之後，工作進行甚爲積極，本報小評，嘗特別予以讀揚。</p>
<p>現該會爲加緊推行新文字會，普及敎育起見，擬先聘敎師二名，分赴各地任教，惟以新文字敎育，在港向屬創舉，須先加以研究，户特開辦新文字師資訓練班，招學員四十名，從事訓練，期滿卽先選合格者二名充任，酌酬津貼月費每名二十元，其餘成績優良者一有機會，亦將聘甩，這實在是香港普及敎育的新紀錄。</p>
<p>査香私新文字學會主辦新文字訓練班的簡章是這樣的：（一）定名新文字的師資訓練班。（二）學科：新文字及其理論，敎授法等。（三）地點：　仔杜老誌道了號了樓致中學校。（四）時間，每週一三五六四晚十時至八時半授課。（五）學期，六星期結束。（六）資格：凡　情新文子，有志推行新文字運動，而能操流利粤語者均可入學，如有敎育經驗及能聽謂國講者亦所歡迎。（七）限額；本班先招四十名，以報名前列者爲限逾額人數如額學習新文字者本會，亦擬設班訓練之，以備爲將來之師資。（八）學費：免收：書籍費自購（約値一二角）·（九）報名；干蹃道中二十三號四樓業餘聯誼社內香港新文字學會生活書店，　仔致中學校。（十）開課；定於五月二十二日星期一下午七時開始上課。</p>

<h3>戰時的日本電影</h3>
<p>— 辛一</p>
<p>自從日本發動侵華戰爭後，他們的電影事業，逐漸趨於衰沉，而近來日本的色情影片的流行，更可以說是不景氣的反映，並足以證明他們實施戰時文化政策的失敗；原來對於人民思　自由過度控制的結果，只有使人們加深反動心理。要想拿藝衛來鼓勵所謂『光榮的　爭』藉以麻醉人民去參加他們認爲神聖的法西集團，便不得不先來約束人民的思想。把它限制到狹義的『歌頌戰爭』的範圍內，那也許對於軍閥們的侵略行動有很大的不利，但是日本人民在重重的壓迫下，他們早已看出軍閥們的欺騙手段、再也不願受他們的驅使，像羔羊般的帖服在可　的軍人手下了。</p>
<p>電影是社會的寫照，文化的宣傳，在現代國家中，它已無　地成爲一種大衆所需的精神食糧。日本的民衆，旣揭穿了軍關們麻木的宣傳，和種種私利的欺騙的企圖，自覺地丢開了　揚『皇軍』的盛德和描寫『神聖職爭』底各種影片，便不得不向另一方面去尋找他們的精神的食糧了。就在這種情形下，色情影片成爲一種畸形的發展。由於國內抑制不住的反戰情緒的髙漲，迎合低級趣味的色情影片，　呈現出活　的趨勢，我們推測這種　情影片流行的原因，無非要想藉此　洩一下大衆積鬱着的苦悶的心情，和緩一下他們的矛盾的思想，並給以大衆一種髙度的刺激，使他們暫時忘記他們自身所遭受的苦痛。影片的題材離開現實愈遠，在軍閱們的心裏，或許是認為有利的吧？</p>
<p>一位日本的老教授說：『砲火轟毀了象牙之塔』，是的，日本戰時的電影再不會找到文化與藝術的價値。</p>
<p>軍人們看到這點。不免　憂滋生，於是文相荒木在一度招待電影界解釋政府新通　的禁止靑年看愛情形片的法律之後，最近又禁　描寫倖運　　的影片了，這到令我們有些不解；不知所謂倖運游戲的影片，是否指戰爭影片，他們旣知倖運游戲之不當，那麼他們對華侵略，是不是賭博式的孤注一　的倖運呢？</p>
<p>因爲提倡戰爭電影的結果，日本電影界所表現的各種矛盾的形態，將愈益明顯；而日本的文化與藝術也都葬送在軍閥們的掌握中，只要看日本電影在刀槍下的彷徨，便可見一斑了。</p>

<h3>建立體育友誼的共同戰線（一）</h3>
<p>— 陳遂賢</p>
<p>自從『五四』運動以後、敎育的宗旨、是德、智、體並重的；當時深感過去的的科舉時代的『重文輕武』、巳失去時代的價値、於是『五四』的口號、大呼『　除重文輕武」—這是『五四』所提倡體育的光　的表示—可是這光榮的表示—已屆二十年了、把原有的敎育宗旨、弄來弄去、也沒有辦法平衡—至於民衆體育更談不上了、</p>
<p>其實、體育和政治是有因果的關係、和社會性質更有密切的關係；我國過去的體育家沒有深刻的認識這一點、或者有認識的而沒有切實實行，所以體育事業不能發展，不是流產的現象、可以說是沒有成孕、</p>
<p>本文是建立體育友誼的共同戰線、照例、對許多陌生的體育同志、首先總得來一套寒式式的客套話、但是我沒有學　這一套客套的、請各位體育朋友恕我罷、事實上、客套是沒有什麽好處、只有助長虛僞的。我們只有勉勵爲眞正的體育事業而斗爭、雖然在街上碰面不相識、但是我寫本文的時候、我是把讀到本文的每個讀者當作自己的摯友、因爲我要把自己的熱情　理想寫出來、訴說我對體育的願望、我很相信、凡是建築在正確的共同的認識上的友誼是値得發揚的。</p>
<p>我國過去之所謂體育、只是有名無實的在學校唯行，最近在軍警學校方面似乎有些積極　、於農民、工人和商人的體育、從來是有沒提及的、但是學校的體育和軍警的體育因爲沒有把握體育的眞理，也完全和體育的本質不相符，因爲體育訓練在一般的學校、是重視『錦標』和「選手制在錦標」每賽或運動會得到錦標歸來、可像是體育成功的歡喜、這些得錦標的運動員、在社會極力宣揚轟動一時之後、便可以當一個體育重要的行政人員或敎練了、雖然有不少的先進的體育同志、力倡體育普遍的訓練、實行打倒錦標化和選手制的口號、可是只　一時的熱情而已、因　缺少「體育眞理」的宣傳同時沒有具體的行動和堅决的意志、竟受了固有勢力的選手們的句圍、而却要打自己的咀吧、至於軍警體育、也是重視錦標主義、一個有聲有色的運動員、可以走進軍警的隊伍充一個堂堂然的大武官來、這個堂堂然的大武官、不是用來任這正的體育敎官、目的是用來去爭取長期的錦標—這是有目共覩的事實、誰也不能加以否認的</p>
<p>所以舉行的各縣運動會、各省運動會、以至全國運動會、部是製造選手的場所、只是那些有聲有色的學生選手們和用來爭錦標的武官們集中表演他們的技能，在運動場中、那些木偶崇拜的觀衆，聲髙彩烈、用幾角錢或幾塊　的入場券，只是去鼓舞他們爭奪錦標、自已是毫無補益的，可是入場券　低限度也要　角錢、只是有產階級才能够事受眼福、在場外只態聽到掌聲的窮光蛋、見場內有觀衆出來的時候　就可　是訪問的新聞記者，這樣的運動會，就是叫做「提倡體育」—</p>
<p>然而、運動會的通例，會場的四遍少不免的貼　光輝的五彩標語，『實行普及體育—』「實行體育救國—』「實行全民體育」種種色色不勝舉、但是從來沒有見到「打倒錦標化—』『提倡農工體育』，『打倒紳商體育』、「打倒選手制」、等類的標語、這種提倡體育的運動會、已二十餘年了、如果這樣去普遍民衆體育的話，再延長幾十年以至幾百年也毫無辦法的，</p>
<p>自從民族解放的戰爭爆發以後、他們還不認識這大時代的轉彎點、所以體育的工作沒有配合抗戰、我們知道抗戰中的文化、還有那一個部門不去參加這神聖的民挨解放的　爭、國防的大衆文學深入農村、民族吼聲的歌詠深入農村、大衆化的漫畫和木刻也深農村……只有廿餘年來自稱救國的體育、却是拿不出半點事實來、　（未完）</p>

<h3>滬貿易恢復繁榮後　入超數字驚人　輸入日貨佔第一們</h3>
<p>上海因其地位之優勝交通之便利、工業得以日臻茂盛、遂成全國貿易之中心、經濟之樞紐爲遠東唯一大埠、戰後金　及貿易重內心移、以致曾一度襄落、今已逐漸恢復　觀、惟入超特增、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>自民國元年以來、進出口貿易總額、由國幣三萬萬元、遞升至十餘萬萬儿、佔全國貿易總額之比例、常在百分之五十以上、進口在民國八年以前、大致、全國百分之一二以至一八佔民國九年以至十兵年、則增為百分、之二〇以上、自後逐年增加、而以二十五年之百分之五八、九六爲圾髙率、出口目民元以八至八年、大致佔百分之四十以上、自後乃减爲百分之三〇左右、迨至二十二年以後、又復增至百分之五〇、</p>
<p>民國二十六年之進口、爲五萬一千零八十一一萬千元、佔百分之五三·四二、出口爲四萬零四百六十七萬二千元、佔百分之四八。二五、如八一三事件荀無發生朋進出口貿易再增四分之一、或可創民元以來之新紀錄、戰後因金融貿易重心之內移、曾一度衰落、旋即逐漸恢復舊觀、如二十七年進口爲二萬七千四百八十九萬六千元、佔百分之三〇·七七、出口爲二萬二千三百零三萬九千元、佔百分之二九、二〇、</p>
<p>自去年第上三季起、海開貿易，卽逐漸恢復舊　、如今府之第一季進口一萬二千八百九十萬零九千元、佔百分之四六，九七、出口八千一百三十三萬千元、佔百分之四一、八〇、比夫較年之同季　口五千二百八十萬零九千元、佔百分之二二、九五，出口三千三百六十九萬八千元、佔百分之二五，一〇、則其進出口貿易增加、爲一萬二千三百七十三萬七千元，足證　關貿易逐漸恢復之中、</p>
<p>上海係淪陷區城、江海關被迫環境、改懸「五色　織、稅收改存日商止金銀行、日籍關員之增加、於是中國政府有許多命令、上海之江海關、竟無法執行、消除八超之計劃、上海關亦不能實現、今貿易雖逐漸恢復、但入超數字、竟有增無减、如今年第一季入超爲四千七百五十七萬八千元、較去年同季之一千九百十萬零七千元、竟增加二千八百四十七萬一千元、此爲全滬人士所應慚悔者也、</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向海關方面探悉、關於日本貨物之輸入、月自去年五份起，已登各國對華貿易之第一位、如今年之第一季爲七千一百三十八滇六千元、較第二位之　　四千八百零一萬三千元、度增加二千三百三十七萬五千元、日貨之輸入、除華北各關外、均係由上海關進口、而非淪陷區西南各關日貨已紹　、是項日貨係向淪陷區域傾銷者、其重要原因、爲滬關被劫稅率被擅自修改、日貨進口、予以種種便利故也、</p>
<p>滬關貿易漸吿恢復、於是外商之商船往來、隨之　增、爲全國各關之冠、如今年一月進出口爲二八〇袋、一、一八一、四七八唱、二月進出口爲二六〇隻、一、一八九、九九三噸、三月進出口爲二九　　、一二六三、九〇一　、今年第一季共計八三五令、三、六三五、三七二噸、惟往來之船隻、亦以日商輪船爲矗多、例如全國今年第一季往來船隻、日商一、五四五隻、二、五二六、二八七　、佔各　之第一位、</p>
<h3>上海居大不易　食品售價飛漲不已</h3>
<p>上海自八一三戰事爆發以來、人民生活、頓見提高、除房屋人口驟增而租會猛漲外、家庭中之日用物品、亦莫不斷漲境髙、至生活所必需之食品、如米糧菜蔬、以及「開門七件事、柴米油監醬醋茶」、無一不漲、如葷菜之鮮肉、腿精每斤一元、中肋每格每元祇購斤四兩、活鷄每元一斤二三兩、鮮魚每斤亦　三四角至八九角不等、至平民視爲最便官之素食品、若「荳芽菜及鹹豆腐」等物、現因原料之黃豆及生油價、受日人之操縱、突飛猛晉、當今春初、生豆油每兀可購五斤七八兩，現只購三斤不足、是以視爲最便宜之食品亦不廉矣、茲將最近所漲之食品售價錄左、</p>

<p>麵紛　每斤　三八〇　刀切麵斤　三〇〇</p>
<p>眞紛　又　六四〇　皮子每斤　三〇〇</p>
<p>小紛　又　四八〇　紛皮每張　二〇</p>
<p>水綫紛　又　一四〇　　腐每塊　四〇</p>
<p>（三）菜塲中最　之素菜（單位角）</p>
<p>鷄毛菜斤　〇·九〇　黃豆芽斤　〇·八〇</p>
<p>頭每斤　〇·八〇　菉豆牙斤　〇·七〇</p>

<p>闊　甜菜又　〇·八〇　×　菜每斤　三·〇〇</p>
<p>上列素菜品之　價、竣未戰前大都起漲三分之二、亦有漲上一倍者、如豆腐前售每塊十文、現則須二十文、腐干每塊十五文、現則須三十文、鹹菜荳芽起碼四五十文可購、現則起碼四五分洋碼矣、大衆生活之艱苦，皆係侵略者之所賜也、</p>
<h3>今年的　上海繅絲業</h3>
<p>上海繅絲業目前最迫切重要之問題、首推原料、　滬上絲廠、每年所消費之乾繭、照目前情形計、須十五萬担以上、本年自有所謂華中公司、竟欲禁止　　　滬、統制各鄕繭行、企圖獨佔之後、滬上各廠深爲　　、近日局勞稍見緩和，　除城鎭以外、四鄕繭行多爲游　隊所控制、如『華中』正式下鄉牧繭、必遭游擊隊之攻擊、故「華中」日僞集議之下、經决定將勢力範圍以外之繭行·暫行放棄、由華人名義下鄕收繭、運城後、再轉售『華中』、一面揚言准許華人、餘繭商、自由設行收購、不加阻止、於是餘　商大見活　、然所牧之繭、聞須與『華中』各半分派，有云可以運滬、有云絕對不能、謠言亦尙多、</p>
<p>滬上目下絲廠三十七家、如一旦無眞原料運滬勢、必被迫停工、各廠有　於斯、故公開集　、在此時期欲有一切實之答　、則不能肯定、　果决定先行於游華區內着手租行、卽看舉行事之方針、　鄕深明大義之繭行主、因不願被『華中』利用、故大都絕合作、紛紛到　與各　簽訂租賃合同　方與行方通力合作、因環境關係、恐發生種種阻撓、故一切責任均由行主負全部責任，今以市上一般之包烘價格列下、</p>
<p>（一）大包供自收、起至上江輪止、一切軍　捐稅、出運費用、行員薪水、飯食、用均由行主負責，每担乾　包烘價　、約三十五元起至四十元以上、</p>
<p>（二）行主僅負供成乾繭及烘工方面之開支、行中警用、飯食第、其餘問題、悉歸客方負責、每担　烘價格約自二十元至二十元以上</p>
<p>大概光陰方面而行、最爲厰商所歡迎、因其靠近長江、出運較爲便利，故包烘價格之上落均須視目前環境而定、較之戰前、約漲三倍至四倍之多、</p>
<p>宜興方面、近因中日兩軍、　戰方殷、對　牧繭前途、殊無把握、恐危險較他處爲多也、（翔）</p>

<h3>『精誠團結抗戰到底』</h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>我記得很淸楚，是去年三月廿七日晚上，我接到老向由漢口發來的快信，他說全國文藝，協會四月一號開成立大會。要我無論如何趕來出席。當時我的興奮眞非　語所能形容，我覺得平時彼人家　爲『文人相輕』，過去曾閙什麽『海派』『京派』的文藝工作者，如今能捐　一切私見，大家都以國家民族利益爲前提，在抗戰建國旗幟之下　結來起來，這件事實在太偉大，太令人欣幸了！當時因爲受馮夫人李德全女士之託在長沙爲戰時兒童保育會募捐的事沒有結束，不能出席成立大會，但我的滿腔熱忱和對大會的期望是借「精誠團結，抗戰到底」的電報轉達了的。</p>
<p>接信和發電報的情形，還歷歷在目，無情的時光，却輕輕地又溜走一年，</p>
<p>這一年來，在我個人是非常感到慚愧的，對文恊沒有半點貢獻，因爲多病和住處距　會所太遠的原故，連開會都常缺席。文協在這個大時代，是應負相當責任的。但工作還做的不够，距離大家所理想的還很遠，今後希望每個文協的同志，都把精神集中起來。幫助文協發展以下的幾項工作：</p>
<p>一，擴大組織，堅强組織。</p>
<p>二，聯絡會員感情，加緊會員工作。</p>
<p>三，健全領導機關，成立前後方各處分會，與總會取得最嚴密之聯　。</p>
<p>四，建立文藝圖書館，使會員或非會員可以自由借　。</p>
<p>五，設立青年創作指導委員會，使許多有志從事文藝創作的年靑朋友，得有機會學習。</p>
<p>六，設立文藝工作者詢問處，負責介紹新書雜誌及文友通信處等。</p>
<p>七，要計劃地　印士兵讀物，民衆讀物，</p>
<p>八，組織前綫服務團或後方考察團，深入隊伍與民間宣傳。以上是我在匆忙中想到的幾點，做爲給這次大會的提議，希望親愛的同志們仍本着精誠團結，抗戰到底的精神，更努力爲民族國家奮鬥！</p>
<h3>論詩的朗誦與朗誦詩</h3>
<p>— 常任俠</p>
<p>伴隨着救亡歌曲而起的朗誦詩運動，漸漸被人注意起來，雖然在大衆中間，朋誦詩還未表現出多少力量，但這一運動若能良好的繼續發展，將來必定能得到應得的成果，這是可預期的，爲了在發展中的這一運動，使其生長，發育以至健全，則我們應該引起廣大文藝界的擁護，幷且實地的去試騐，探討與改進，以期成爲大衆所歡喜接受的東西。</p>
<p>對於詩的朗誦，有人以爲應該加重音樂的成分，但就我個人在漢口，在桂林，所參加的幾次朗誦會中試騐的結果，如其說朋誦詩偏重於音樂方面，還不如說偏重於戲劇方面，『朋誦』與『唱』是有區分的。「唱」詩要音樂化，卽是說要整齊，要有韻律，常時　用樂器去伴奏。用『唱』的方法把這詩演奏出來，但『朗誦』則是另一種方法，她不需要有韻，在屢次的試驗中，倒是無韻的散文詩，便於朗誦。朗誦必要的是聲調的鏗鏘，吐字的淸楚，爲了　發這詩中的意境，每句或每字，可以由朗誦者加上髙低的昔符，悲壯，沉痛，歡喜，憤怒，厭恨，戀慕，希望，恐　等等都要由聲音中表演出來，遺裏同時便應當使用出演劇的技巧，不要忘記了你身體的姿態，手勢的動作，與面部的表情，要同你所朋誦的詩融成一片。在舞台上你所得的寶貴的技術，朗誦詩的時候，也是使用的最好的場所。</p>
<p>前些年丹麥的一位世界著名的朗誦詩人，來到中國，在南京的大朗誦。我曾去　過，他所朗誦的拉芳登寓言，以及許多默洲的名詩，便是像在舞台表演的壹樣，大槪有許人看過「羅密歐與朱麗葉』以及『如願』這兩張名片吧？這是沙氏的詩劇被搬上銀幕的，在「羅蜜歐與朱　葉」一片中，名演員約翰巴里摩從階上走下的一大叚朗誦，手眼俱到，非常精彩，在『如願』一片中那位女主角，也是歐洲的名優去參加攝製的，在開場與結尾兩叚獨白，也便是兩大叚詩的朋誦，美妙動聽，都可做爲我們詩的朗誦模範，朗誦偏於戲劇方面而不重在音樂方面，朗誦自有其特獨之點，若果朗誦與唱相同，則與救亡歌曲何異若果認為『詩無不可朗誦，何以單有朗誦詩』，其實也未盡然，試　中國　詩來說，在再詩中絕句律詩，力求平仄韻律的調協，便是注重其音樂的成份，使之成爲宜唱的詩，至於五古七古中，杜甫常有五平五仄之句，並月使用拗韻，便是想極力扭離音樂，不宜於唱，到了宋人古詩中常用三平落脚的方法，也無非要朗誦時增加聲調的鏗鏘而已。一般社會所流行的大鼓書，常有唱書與說書的不同，在大鼓書中的所謂說，也卽是朋誦。朗誦不必用音樂，但也可以用音樂去伴奏，其目的只是幫助朗誦者加重其氛圍，與香通電影中配奏音樂一　，是與唱詩的伴奏不同的。</p>
<p>關於朗誦的詩，一般都以爲要通俗化。大衆化，口語化，這是當然的，但切忌的是標語化，此外內容的空洞與抽像，也成爲朗誧詩的致命傷。詩有詩的藝術手法，縱是朗誦詩，也不能例外，內容不能動人，縱然通俗化大衆化，口語化，仍然不能得大衆的歡迎，所謂通俗化，大衆化，口語化，這只是能使大家了解的條件，但要能引起大衆的與味，則單是盡了遭條件還是不够的。在抗戰的目前，爲大衆服務的詩人們，對於通俗化口語化是容易做到的，但一方面那些意像派的，唯美派的，或者惡魔的派等等詩體加速减少。另一方面標語口號的詩歌却又突然猖獗流行。標語口號决不是詩。聯綴成詩是自找死路。大衆對於一個標語的意義，還要很多解釋，若朗誦一串標語口號，大衆望望然去的，我們在朗誦詩的外形上要通俗，在內容上情感更要豐富，敍述更要具體。朗誦的詩最好是敍事詩，古人所謂白天的詩老嫗都解，也是指他的敍事詩而言，古代行吟詩人荷馬的着作，傳於今者如伊利亞特奥德賽之類，則都是史詩，在我們鄕村流轉的唱書人，所講說的也都是英雄淸官等故事。在目前爭取民族解放的鬥爭中，壯烈的史實是很多的，這正可作爲朗誦詩的題村，來激揚全民反帝反法西的熱情，共同走上抗戰的營星。</p>
<p>抒情詩是不適宜於朗誦的，小的Lyric則只可以低二·有些　則簡直只龍　　，由視覺來傳　　的情感，所謂感覺派的時便是這一　。這。不要　不能朗誦，卽是朗誦，大衆也沒有　　悠閑的趣味。我們爲大衆服務，便要研究大衆的風俗習慣生活狀况及其潛在的痛苦，來做爲我們製作的範籌。　去晚書人所說的淸官英雄，替民衆解除苦難，濟困扶危，這正是在封建勢力積壓下，民衆的一種夢想，所以能被廣大的羣衆歡迎。若是劍閣聞　。黛玉悲秋一類的故事。這只是有閒階級　飽後的消遣，民衆却沒有這種多愁善感的趣味，爲抗戰耶務的　人們，是决不能以身邊　事。與抗戰毫無關係的內賽，去向大康朗口。</p>
<p>偶了鹽立壇一選動，發晨煙一運動。我們應該多開朗勵會。惟有　　中纔能發現我們的錯誤，　能穩定　們的基礎，先作小規模的試驗，然後走向　頭，走向農村，走向工廠，走向部隊，走向種種不同的羣衆中間，這纔發揮朗誦詩積極的效用</p>
<p>爲了擁護這一運動，我們希望對於『朗誦的詩』的創作與『詩的朗誦』的方法做不斷的探討，並且作不斷的試驗。　（完）</p>
<h3>當前的漫畫</h3>
<p>— 何浧江</p>
<p>繪畫是髙尙的藝術的一部門，爲國防而藝術，抗戰而藝術，所以，圖畫也應該配合抗戰作宣傳，可是，畫人畢竟是藝術家，象牙塔裏的高士，所以，一部分的畫人，掩着耳朶，閉上目，寄情于高山流水，花卉翎毛，然而，不能抺煞，一部份靑年漫畫家。正在運用着藝術的　，重視現實，觀察現實，把一切的矛盾，一切的黑　一切的不平，通邊了藝術的塗染，藉光和色，和背景，表露出來，盡情的發揮，以盡其對抗戰所負的使命。</p>
<p>自抗戰而後，我個人曾經參觀過抗戰漫畫展覽的有兩次，第一次，是在廣州長堤靑年會，是去年的春間。第二次，就是這囘中央戲院的中國漫畫展覽了！</p>
<p>這回，中國漫畫展覽會裏。漫畫數十幅，悉名家的作品，　　　　　　，盡情的表現了抗戰的偉大，神聖，和勇敢。爲抗戰而宣傳，爲國防而藝術，該是有意義的罷！，丁聽君的『媽媽』，正顯示了小孩子所遭遇的悲慘的命運，　書面是寫一個小孩子，對着被炸了的屋宇壓斃的母親啼哭，這趁一　很深刻的作品，光色都很好，葉淺予先生的『和平之餌』充份地指示我們不要上　人的和平的　，我們知道中遂妥協就是滅亡。徐如鄭家織的『長大了我也當兵去，」陳煙橋的『　　，　』、　　　　　　，　　」都很好，此外都頗過得去。皆　有意義的作品，决非雅士騷人所　美的山水花卉等作品可比呀。不鎮，這些作品中，　　　　　　　　　，　　調揚戰士的英勇，歌頌軍民的合作，肯定抗戰勝利的多，不過關於政治方面的黑暗的一面，漢奸的下場，鄕長縣長的腐敗，都未　予以諷刺打擊或忠吿。在當前的漫畫，所負抗戰宣傳的使命至大，比其他文學宣傳收效還多，它以綜錯的線條，配以光陰，顏色，一幅成功的作品，眞可以支配了人們的感情，它可以使不識字的人看懂。</p>
<p>中國的漫畫家，木刻家鄒奮起罷！正視現實，面對着侵略者，以藝術的眼，對</p>
<p>讀揚抗戰，表現戰士的英勇，軍民合作。只有軍民合作，才有可靠的後盾，才有偉大的力量產生。然而寓意的深刻構圖的美妙，是有待於漫畫家的努力啊！</p>
<p>努力吧！加緊吧！爲神聖的民族　　，向全國，全世界，全人類宣傳吧！漫畫家，毋忘當前重大的責任！友秋</p>
<h3>「流寇隊長」　一個集體創作的介紹</h3>
<p>— 友秋</p>
<p>「流寇隊長」三幕劇是『　藝』戲劇系　體創作之一，可以說是戰時戲劇的偉大成就。它的梗概如下：</p>
<p>一個機槍連的排長袁占魁帶了自己的都下脫離隊伍。想幹流寇式的生活，却和一個民間游擊隊合流，袁做了隊畏。但袁自己是有着流寇山賊意識的人，所以放　自己的部下　擾老百姓，搶老百姓的東西，並且以爲應該這樣的，因爲游擊隊是替老百姓拚命，老百姓便應一切服從，不准作聲，本來的那個游擊隊領導者徐展如，現在是隊中政治指導員，　他在民衆中進行政治工作，却給他們不絕破壞。民衆要把他的話當作空話。但他不屈不撓地繼續工作，並相信在行動中會把這些破壞分子敎育得改變過來。因爲紀律不嚴　，漢奸便混進隊伍中。袁隊長也因對大運和姚二嫂的蠱惑投進澳奸的懷裏。他們都視徐展如爲眼中釘，設計把他轟走，並佈置了漢好暴　的局面，要袁隊畏把部隊帶到接近敵人的地方，打算人槍一拚投入敵人方面去，可是這計劃給羣衆力量阻撓，使他們不能順利淮行，反而在撤退和防守的行動中，徐展如得以發揚他的能力，把袁隊長的手下幾個拉轉來，覺醒起來了。計劃失敗之後。漢奸現了形，對大運給處死，　隊長也在羣衆怒吼中被判决了。游擊隊成了自覺的戰列，眞正民衆的武力，成爲抗敵的一個鐵的支流。</p>
<p>在這裏，游擊隊成長的過程做了主題。它獻給我們游擊的真貌。民間游擊隊的結集，在初期當然是未可滿意的。但政治工作的進行，行動中成員的再教育，會把隊伍變爲堅實，游擊隊時被人想像神話化，這是錯誤，在這裏有了解答，游擊隊被汪精衛等誣　爲流寇，這就是把缺點誇張，把缺點視爲一成不可變的，在這裏便解答這個問題，用形象指示游擊隊堅實化的過程及其必然性，足以粉碎漢奸的誣　！因此『流寇隊長』這戲曲在後方民衆便有了敎育意。</p>
<p>還有，它能把游擊的缺點及其克服，用典型和形象表達，說明政治工作的重要性和艱鉅性，要以不屈不撓的精神去支持才能成功，但又表現了政治工作播下每一粒種子總要茁芽的，不斷的努力是滋養的水份，因此，『流寇隊長」這戲曲對游擊戰士，政治工作者有重大的敎育意義。</p>
<p>與型創作很成功　它用不　壯大的　　來眩人，只用活生生的人物來抓住觀眾一，人物都有個性，沒有公式化定型化，這是技巧成功的　據。</p>
<p>倍斯巴洛夫說，『某種巨大問題被解决于形象中的時候，形象才有巨大的敎育的意義」，用這話來說明『流冦隊長』的價値，是很切當的。</p>

        <h1>1939.05.15</h1>
<h3>Serious Internal and External Crises in Japan</h3>
<p>The Japanese invaders have been facing the staunch resistance of the Chinese nation for nearly two years. Despite the invaders and their hired traitors and compromisers continuing to make every effort to carry out arrogant propaganda, the fact facing people around the world is that the internal and external crises of the Japanese invaders have indeed become increasingly serious, and they have stepped onto the path of ultimate collapse.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the domestic situation in Japan. The first phenomenon is the severity of the economic crisis. Japanese Prime Minister Yonai recently stated that "Japanese villages all feel a shortage of manpower, because many strong young men in the villages have been conscripted to attack China, and many farmers in various places have rushed to work in munitions and other factories, and agricultural production is on the verge of despair. At the same time, raw materials are lacking, and many industries are on the verge of stagnation!" (See Reuters report carried in newspapers on May 9th.) From this confession by the Japanese authorities, even without additional commentary, it is easy to imagine the severity of the Japanese rural economic crisis, the crisis in production, the crisis in foreign trade, the crisis in people's livelihood, and the difficulties in replenishing troops for the invasion of China! Second, due to the above-mentioned economic crisis, the sharpening of class antagonism and the intense development of internal struggles within the invasion camp have been further created. The main expression of this is the unemployment and unrest among the vast number of farmers, light industrial workers, and handicraft workers, while the munitions industry and related industries… At the same time, due to the persistence of the war, foreign exchange controls and import controls have further driven the panic of all non-military industries and export industrial and commercial operators, forcing the vast number of small and medium-sized property owners to fall into the ranks of the proletariat. How this class division and the formation and development of two major opposing forces will promote the outbreak of the internal crisis in Japan is not difficult to imagine! Third, this economic and even social crisis in Japan not only exists in Japan itself, but also exists in Japan's territories and colonies, and the crisis in these places is even more… Therefore, this crisis is even more serious! The fact that the Japanese authorities are scheduled to convene a national judicial conference today (the 15th) to deal with the escalating anti-war sentiments of the people and to crack down on those who violate economic controls, and have ordered judicial officers from Korea and Taiwan to rush to attend, shows the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>Looking at the international situation, Japan's position in the international arena is declining, becoming increasingly unfavorable, and increasingly isolated. First, the consolidation and development of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression front of democratic and peaceful countries has directly and indirectly helped the global movement to aid China and sanction Japan. Recently, the entire US Pacific Fleet has moved east, and since April, no munitions have been exported to Japan (see Shanghai dispatch from Washington on the 14th reported in today's newspaper). Britain is actively strengthening its defenses in the Far East and preparing for the Singapore naval conference, the Soviet Union is increasing its defenses in the Far East with land and naval forces and the advancement of the aid-China movement; and the initiation and progress of cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States, and the United States and the Soviet Union; all of these have made Japan's international situation even worse. Second, the "anti-communist" group of fascist aggressors has begun to expose its true nature of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Although they have adopted more frantic collusion in order to deal with the anti-aggression movement of democratic and peaceful countries, such as the recent negotiations on a German-Italian military alliance and even the brewing of a German-Italian-Japanese military alliance; at the same time, the continued existence of the hypocritical compromise policies of democratic and peaceful countries has given the aggression group even more rampant opportunities. However, the difficulties faced by Germany and Italy are in fact the same as those faced by Japan, especially in the economic aspect, so there is no hope of any assistance for Japan's current difficulties. In the confrontation between these two fronts, although Japan cannot but move further towards the reactionary fascist path in order to intensify internal exploitation and external plunder; this will inevitably further increase the degree of internal and external crises in Japan, especially increasing internal turmoil in Japan.</p>
<p>The way the Japanese invaders deal with this internal and external crisis is to adopt reactionary fascist methods, that is, internally… For example, the recent decision to fully implement the National Mobilization Law and unify the army and navy, and the large-scale arrest of anti-war and anti-economic control elements, are obvious examples. At the same time, they do not hesitate to launch a second "February 26th" incident in the country to promote the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance, suppress the anti-war movement of small and medium-sized property owners and the vast masses internally, and externally implement further speculation and adventure, such as recently intensifying intimidation of Britain, the United States, and France, robbing the Tianjin and Shanghai concessions, and landing on Gulangyu. However, this method of dealing with internal and external crises by the Japanese rulers will not only not work, but will instead further increase these crises! Therefore, we dare to assert that if there are no sudden changes in the international situation, such tragicomedies caused by the deepening of the crisis in Japan will continue to emerge one after another!</p>
<p>Here, we must recognize that the severity of the internal and external crises of the Japanese invaders is the result of our 22 months of adherence to the united front and persistent resistance war. It is also the result of our 22 months of resolutely supporting the central government and repeatedly defeating Wang Jingwei's and others' proposals for "anti-communist peace." We have exchanged these results with 22 months of bloody struggle and the sacrifice of countless lives and property, and we must never give up lightly! Absolutely can not be lightly ruined! No! We must also solemnly point out that this crisis and difficulty of Japan is only the beginning. If we can further carry forward the spirit of struggle of the past 22 months, adhere to the united front, and persist in the protracted resistance war, then Japan's internal and external crises will be further expanded and deepened. At the same time, it will also be more helpful to the international situation being favorable to us, and help increase our country's combat effectiveness and political progress, and make it possible to advance the arrival of the period of general counter-offensive, recovery of lost territories, and striving for final victory. Conversely, if we blindly believe that Japan's crisis and difficulties have reached the final stage, if we therefore no longer strengthen the united front, no longer focus on the implementation of democratic politics and the improvement of people's livelihood, and no longer further mobilize the vital forces of the entire nation and international sympathy and assistance, then our national liberation cause may encounter unprecedented setbacks, and actually help the Japanese invaders to resolve their internal and external crises. This is what our entire nation should be urgently aware of today.</p>
<h3>Newspapers Can Now Be Self-Sufficient: Various Counties in Quzhou Are Actively Improving Manufacturing</h3>
<p>— Guan Pu</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Zhejiang) The annual paper production of various counties in Quzhou, Zhejiang is about 500,000 dan. According to regional distribution, Qu County produces about 300,000 dan annually, Longyou produces about 100,000 dan annually, and Jiang, Changshan, Suichang, and Shouchang counties each produce about 25,000 to 35,000 dan annually. The well-known factories that are organized include Qu County's Yuquan Paper Mill, Siwei Paper Mill, Housheng Paper Mill, Huanan Paper Mill, Longyou's Yumin Paper Mill, and the Improved Paper Mill affiliated with the Papermaking Training Institute. The total annual output value is about 3,000,000 yuan, and no fewer than tens of thousands of people directly and indirectly depend on it for a living. There are many types of paper, such as Nanping, Yingjian, 25-pack paper, Fangxi Dajing, Fangjing, Fang 5,000 yuan, 6,000 yuan book, Songbian, improved Mao Lu, etc., and the Huajian of Wei and the Nanping of Longyou are more famous. The output is not only large, but they are also necessary for double books and superstitious paper. Except for a small amount sold locally, most of them were previously transported to Hangzhou, then from Hangzhou to Shanghai, and then Shanghai served as a distribution center, and they were transported to Jiangsu, Qingdao, and the four northeastern provinces. Since the start of the war of resistance, the market has been greatly affected, and now there is only one sales route that takes the route from Wenzhou to Shanghai. However, judging from the production and sales of paper in Quzhou, there are many shortcomings. The main ones are:</p>
<p>(1) In terms of production, although there are many types of paper produced, most of them are not practical. Except for improved Mao Lu yuan and Songbian, which can barely be used for official documents, the rest are of poor quality and are mostly used for foil paper and burning. However, improved Mao Lu, etc. also have many shortcomings: First, the production volume is not large, and second, the paper size is inconsistent and does not meet printing requirements. Therefore, what urgently needs to be improved in terms of production is: (1) Improve papermaking technology, (2) improve quality, and (3) standardize paper sizes.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of transportation and sales, the past sales areas have been affected by the war, and the market is completely controlled by Shanghai merchants. For example, the average price of Nanping paper produced in Longyou in Shanghai in the 27th year of the Republic was more than 8 yuan per dan. After deducting the shipping cost of 3 yuan for transportation from Longyou, Lishui, and Wenzhou to Shanghai, the local price should be 5 yuan. However, the merchants only offered 3 yuan for purchase. Therefore, the aspects to be improved in terms of transportation and sales are: (1) Expand sales areas, (2) find ways to eliminate the control of intermediaries, and enable producers and consumers to trade directly.</p>
<p>Quzhou paper production and sales have many shortcomings, so sales have been shrinking year by year, while Western paper is being dumped in large quantities. Taking Qu County as an example, the comparison of sales of the two types of paper in the most recent three years is as follows:</p>
<p>Note: (1) The above two tables are based on a survey by the Fifth District Office for Improving Paper Production and Sales.</p>
<p>(2) The unit of Quzhou paper is piece, each piece is 2,000 sheets, and the unit of Western paper is ream, each ream is 1,000 sheets.</p>
<p>(3) Among them, white newsprint, white glazed paper, and various colored glazed papers have decreased year by year, probably because this type of paper is mostly imported goods and has been cut off after the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Most Western paper is newsprint. Now, due to the wartime relationship, the supply of coming is cut off, but the demand in the interior is increasing day by day. If Quzhou paper can improve its quality and standardize the paper size, then the sales of Western paper in the past will definitely be replaced by Quzhou paper. There is no doubt about it, so the current problem is the issue of production technology. If the problem of production technology can be properly resolved, then the sales problem can be solved accordingly. In order to meet this demand, the Office of the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fifth District of Zhejiang has prepared to establish the following: Improved Papermaking Training Institute, Improved Papermaking Factory, Production Office, and Improved Paper Production Cooperative, starting with technical improvement and solving production and sales problems in connection with it. The process is quite worth reporting and for general reference:</p>
<p>Cultivating Technical Talents</p>
<p>In order to improve papermaking technology, the cultivation of technical talents is naturally the first priority. On May 1, 27th year of the Republic, the district established the Fifth District Improved Papermaking Training Institute in the Gukou area of Longyou and attached an Improved Papermaking Factory for students to practice. The opening expenses of the Training Institute and the production of the Paper Mill were each 5,000 yuan, totaling 10,000 yuan. In addition to 5,000 yuan subsidized by the provincial government, the paper-producing counties jointly raised 2,500 yuan; Qu County and Longyou each contributed 750 yuan, Jiangshan 500 yuan, Suichang 300 yuan, and Bingchang 200 yuan. The remaining 2,500 yuan was borrowed from the Qu County Cooperative Bank for working capital, with an agreement to repay it within one year (October 25, 27th year of the Republic to March 5, 28th year of the Republic). In July of that year, the first class of 14 students and 40 apprentices were recruited, all of whom were recommended by the paper-producing counties to enter the institute. The training period was set at six months. Students in the student class were required to have a junior high school education and were taught papermaking technology, applied chemistry for papermaking, an introduction to cooperation, and factory management. For the first three months, they studied science for two hours every day, and the rest of the time was spent practicing. In the last three months, they were assigned to practice in the attached factory, in order to combine academic knowledge and practical skills. Apprentices in the apprentice class were required to have an elementary school education and were divided into four subjects: material preparation, pulping, papermaking, and drying. They were all assigned to teach in the attached paper mill, focusing on the development of technical management knowledge. The first class graduated in December of the 27th year of the Republic. Except for those who left the institute due to unforeseen circumstances, a total of 40 people graduated, including 15 students (6 from Longyou, 2 from Suichang, 4 from Jiangshan, 2 from Qu County, and 1 from Shouchang) and 25 apprentices (8 from Longyou, 4 from Suichang, 3 from Jiangshan, 6 from Qu County, and 4 from Shouchang). All of them were assigned back to their original counties to take on technical work in improving the paper industry.</p>
<p>Establishing a Model Paper Mill</p>
<p>In order to provide a demonstration for various paper mills in the district and provide a place for students and apprentices to practice, an Improved Paper Mill was attached to the Training Institute. The factory has now achieved considerable success in the manufacture of newsprint. Its products include white newsprint (now discontinued) and several types of green newsprint. According to statistics, the average monthly output is 120 reams of Grade A green newsprint (2.4 feet long and 1.65 feet wide) (1,000 sheets per ream). The following is a table of the factory's production for the first half of last year:</p>
<p>Month Product Quantity</p>
<p>July-August Grade B white newsprint 45 reams</p>
<p>Nanping paper 1 piece (2,000 sheets)</p>
<p>Grade A white newsprint 3 reams</p>
<p>September Grade A green newsprint 55 reams</p>
<p>Grade A white newsprint 3 reams 778 sheets</p>
<p>October Grade A green newsprint 104 reams 46 sheets</p>
<p>November Grade A green newsprint 77 reams 934 sheets</p>
<p>December Grade A green newsprint 119 reams 350 sheets</p>
<p>Total</p>
<p>Grade B white newsprint 55 reams</p>
<p>Grade A green newsprint 356 reams 748 sheets</p>
<p>Grade A white newsprint 24 reams</p>
<p>Nanping paper 1 piece</p>
<p>The green newsprint produced by the factory is carefully crafted with pure heat and has excellent quality. Compared with Western paper, it is not inferior at all. The price is 8 yuan and 7 jiao per ream, which is also cheaper than Western paper. In addition to meeting the needs of various counties in the district, it is sold to western Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and even Jiangxi and Hunan (the Quzhou Daily and Huizhou Daily now use this green newsprint for printing). It is a pity that the output is limited and cannot fully meet the needs of all parties. The factory is now planning to add bag paper and Ma paper this year, and then raise funds to expand production in the second half of the year, and urge the various counties to improve paper production cooperatives in order to achieve large-scale production.</p>
<p>Controlling the Production and Sales of Quzhou Paper</p>
<p>Since the production technology of improved paper has been relatively resolved and the production volume has a growing trend, if the sales channels are not smooth, the previous efforts will be in vain. Therefore, in order to achieve integrated production and sales, the Improved Paper Production and Sales Office was established in July of the 27th year of the Republic. Its members are various improved paper mills (Yuquan, Yumin, Huanan, Siwei, Housheng, Fifth District Papermaking Training Institute), and it is supervised and guided by the Fifth District Commissioner's Office and the Qu County and Longyou County governments. The expenses are initially borne according to the number of paper vats in each factory: Yuquan 3, Housheng 5, Yumin 2, Siwei 2, and the Training Institute 2. In addition, there is the organization of the Fifth District Paper Transportation and Sales Office. Because at the provincial materials adjustment conference held in Lishui in April last year, it was decided to organize a paper transportation and sales office, but some paper merchants and vat owners strongly opposed it due to vested interests. After several consultations, it was finally decided that the Fifth District could organize a transportation and sales office separately, jointly organized by vat owners and paper merchants from Qu, Jiang, Sui, Shou, and Changshan counties. Longyou also operates independently in the form of a cooperative. All of these are in line with the integration of the production and sales of Quzhou paper and seek self-sufficiency in newsprint.</p>
<p>Although we cannot consider ourselves satisfied with the production technology of Quzhou's handicraft papermaking, and the transportation and sales organization should also be adjusted, we believe that Quzhou paper is a very promising industry that can respond to the situation of "newsprint shortage" in the interior in a timely manner and benefit cultural propaganda a lot. The improvement policies adopted by the responsible authorities are also very correct. The development into a "modernized" industry in the future awaits the efforts of the people.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Unity of Young Students in Heyuan County: Converging into a Mighty Tide of Eliminating Traitors</h3>
<p>— Lin Heng</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Enthusiastic applause passed several major resolutions.</p>
<p>Today, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall took on a new atmosphere. Various national defense cartoons and slogans with bold lines and bright colors were inserted around it. As soon as the clock struck eleven, the auditorium was filled with a group of lively and lovely young students and children. Loud voices kept singing: "May Fourth Movement Song", "On the Taihang Mountains", "Eliminating Traitors"... The walls were shaking with the songs.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the chairman reported on the historical sites of the "May Fourth" Movement. With the great historical facts, representatives of the party and government authorities and various groups gave passionate and valuable speeches on the experience and lessons of the student movement, the tasks and policies of the youth movement, and the resistance against Japan and traitors.</p>
<p>After the speeches, the proposals began. The first was a telegram supporting Commander Zhang of the Fourth War Area and Chairman Li; the second was a request to the authorities to implement wartime education and organize a committee to handle the matter; the third was to launch various schools to respond to the government's recent call for the movement of 500,000 comfort letters, deciding that each student and youth should write at least five letters each, and a ghostwriting office was also set up to mobilize the public to participate; the fourth was to schedule a joint military-civilian party in Heyuan County on the 14th of this month, stipulating that each agency, group, and school should send at least a number of representatives to attend; the fifth was to decide that the 15th to 21st would be the military service propaganda week, organize teams to go deep into the villages and comfort the families of soldiers resisting Japan; the sixth was a petition to the commissioner's office to reply to the case of punishing the traitor Li Daoxuan and confiscating his property... These proposals were all proposed by the unified organization of the eight major groups in Heyuan County: Heyuan County Anti-Japanese Youth League, Anti-Japanese Workers' League, Anti-Japanese Children's League, County Middle School Student Autonomous Association, Women's Association, Dongjiang Office of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard, Heyuan Branch of the Youth Group, and Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Service Corps - the Joint Symposium. They were all passed by the entire audience with enthusiastic and prolonged applause, which was a sign of the success of the meeting.</p>
<p>Converging into a Mighty Tide of Eliminating Traitors</p>
<p>After the chairman announced the order of the parade, it immediately converged into a mighty torrent, originating from the Public Education Center of the Memorial Hall, flowing through the Zuping streets. When it reached the gate of the Commissioner's Office of District ×, the chairman asked the commissioner on behalf of the team for a reply to the case of punishing the traitor Li Daoxuan and confiscating his property, but the team shouted slogans of "Down with the traitor Li Daoxuan (currently the chairman of the puppet provincial government and the administrative commissioner of the First District)" and "Eliminate traitors" outside the gate, followed by a chorus of singing and music.</p>
<p>"Eliminate traitors, eliminate traitors, traitors are a hidden danger in our hearts, how can we save the current national crisis if we don't clear our own ranks?"</p>
<p>"Eliminate traitors, eliminate traitors, traitors are a hidden danger in our hearts, they are national traitors who sell out the nation, not even half of them can be let go."</p>
<p>"Big traitors sell the country to communicate with ×, small traitors sell themselves as dogs, medium traitors surrender to be thieves, and quasi-traitors compromise and seek peace.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Dear young friends," the secretary of the Commissioner's Office began to reply to the team, "Everyone's high enthusiasm for saving the country is very commendable, especially the enthusiasm and initiative in eliminating traitors is even more admirable... In the previous Heyuan All-Circles Eliminating Traitors Conference, a petition to the government to punish the traitor Li Daoxuan and confiscate his property was passed. We have already requested instructions from the provincial government. Before the provincial government has replied, we will still obey the government's orders. Tonight, we will urgently send a telegram to the provincial government for instructions and then reply to everyone, okay? Please forgive us..."</p>
<p>After receiving a satisfactory reply, the team marched again in neat steps, singing passionate songs, raising high their passionate iron fists, and shouting the slogan of "Strengthening unity, long-term cooperation, resisting the war to the end". Under such a high tide of anti-Japanese sentiment, the entire crowd walked out of the shops and houses to watch, and some were even attracted to the team, and the marching team became stronger.</p>
<p>The team walked to the public current affairs speaking platform at the intersection, where the traces of the Heyuan All-Circles Eliminating Traitors Movement Week were still left. The Eliminating Traitors Conference was held, followed by performances of Eliminating Traitors plays and anti-traitor speeches on the speaking platform every night. A huge wave of eliminating traitors was set off in Heyuan! The huge wave warned many traitors!</p>
<p>The team walked to the gate of the new house of the traitor Li Daoxuan, and the emotions of the crowd were even higher, demanding that the house be destroyed. After the meeting of the presidium, it was decided that we should not take any extreme actions before receiving instructions from the government, in order to show the youth's sincere support and respect for the government. Finally, only the "memorial arch" in front of the gate was taken down, carried by the team, and brought to the county anti-Japanese support association.</p>
<p>Studying Experience and Lessons</p>
<p>In order to review today's meeting, parade, and study the experience and lessons of the "May Fourth" Movement, the presidium decided to convene an expanded symposium. After a heated discussion, the chairman summarized the experience and lessons:</p>
<p>First, the "May Fourth" Movement demonstrated the great patriotic enthusiasm and heroic spirit of struggle of intellectuals. This great movement promoted the development of the Chinese revolution, and at the same time, it exposed the greatest weakness of intellectuals, the lack of revolutionary persistence. This weakness was the main reason for the failure of the "May Fourth" Movement. This point warns and strengthens how our current youth movement should persist in struggle and strengthen efforts!</p>
<p>Second, the "May Fourth" Movement was a spontaneous anti-Japanese and anti-traitor national united front of students, workers, and merchants. This spontaneous national united front played a decisive role in the victory of opposing the traitors and refusing to sign the Treaty of Versailles. At the same time, precisely because this spontaneous national united front still had the serious weakness of lacking a broad mass base and being insufficiently expanded and consolidated, the "May Fourth" Movement could not achieve a thorough victory! This experience teaches us that we should currently intensify the consolidation and development of the anti-Japanese national united front, which can provide a strong guarantee for the final victory.</p>
<p>Third, due to the domestic divisions at that time, we were unable to resist the enemy's conspiracy to use "Chinese to control Chinese" to undermine our national unity, and allowed them to achieve their unearned victory. Now that the war of resistance is about to enter the second, more difficult stage, the enemy is also intensifying the use of traitors and pro-Japanese elements to undermine unity everywhere. We should uphold unity, adhere to the long-term cooperation of all anti-Japanese forces, and broadly launch the movement to eliminate traitors.</p>
<p>Fourth, the reason why Li Daoxuan became a traitor was not accidental. He had a consistent opportunistic style of fickleness. He was the most selfish and self-interested person, who has always contracted smuggling and directly contacted × and embarked on the road of traitors. At a time when smuggling is most prevalent in Dongjiang, we must be vigilant against all smugglers.</p>
<h3>The Latinized New Script is an Ideal Tool for Promoting Life Education... After Reading Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Letter to Comrades of the Life Education Society"</h3>
<p>— Wo Dan</p>
<p>In the Hong Kong Shen Bao of April 20th and 21st, I read Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Letter to Comrades of the Life Education Society," which brought us correct guidance and encouragement. Mr. Tao's advocated Life Education Movement has been going on for twelve years. The seeds of Life Education have swept across China. The Xin'an Touring Troupe is an example, and the various Chinese schools across the country are examples. Moreover, Mr. Tao Xingzhi's educational ideals and methods: knowing and then transmitting, doing knowing knowing doing, have become the motto of today's general national salvation workers.</p>
<p>Here, Mr. Tao also pointed out: What have we done in these twelve years? Three things, and these have not been completed. The first is anti-Westernized education, the second is anti-traditional education, and the third is to boldly establish educational theories and methods for freedom and equality in a semi-feudal country.</p>
<p>And in these three things, in order to promote the first two things. The third thing; to build theories and methods for education that strives for freedom and equality, then passive opposition is futile and will not achieve the goal. So, he also said:</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People are the highest guidance for our work. The important military, political, economic, and educational aspects must be coordinated to transform a semi-colonial and semi-feudal family into a free, equal, and popular state.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Tao also instructed! Education must have several conditions:</p>
<p>First, education must be combative and a weapon for national and human liberation.</p>
<p>Second, education must be life; all education must be effective through life.</p>
<p>Third, education must be scientific: it must be constantly studied to develop concrete methods based on objective circumstances, and the content must include natural sciences and social sciences.</p>
<p>Fourth, education must be for the masses.</p>
<p>Fifth, education must be planned. There must be a plan to allocate human and financial resources with a sense of urgency and importance.</p>
<p>In the fourth point, it is clearly stated that the ultimate goal of education is for the masses and should not be for a few. However, consider that more than 80 percent of our vast compatriots are still bright-eyed blind, illiterate, and ignorant, which is a major obstacle to our war of resistance!</p>
<p>In a proposal by Du Fen and 43 others at the Third National Political Consultative Conference, "A Proposal to Mobilize National Intellectuals, Eliminate Illiteracy, and Popularize National Consciousness to Benefit the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction," it is explained in detail:</p>
<p>"Eliminating illiteracy and popularizing national consciousness to increase the understanding and enthusiasm of the broad masses for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is a task that must be urgently pursued in mobilizing the masses."</p>
<p>Moreover, here is a statistic on the large number of illiterate people in China:</p>
<p>"The population of our country is estimated to be 450 million (based on the customs estimate of the seventeenth year). Among them, excluding those aged one to sixteen (belonging to the scope of infant, children's compulsory education, and mass supplementary education), and those aged forty-seven to sixty, accounting for about 50% of the population, the remaining seventeen to forty-six years old account for about 50% of the total population, i.e., 225 million people, of whom about 80% are illiterate, i.e., 180 million people. These 180 million people are all adults in the nation, i.e., the backbone of the masses. At this extraordinary time of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, in order to cope with the current situation and increase national strength, it is an urgent need to quickly improve their cultural level."</p>
<p>Furthermore, this proposal lists in detail various concrete plans, and there are six methods that can be effectively implemented. (See Wartime Education, Special Issue of Volume 4, Issue 2.)</p>
<p>Here, we believe that if we can adopt the Latinized New Script to implement the elimination of illiteracy, consolidate the anti-Japanese national consciousness of the masses, and improve the cultural level, it will definitely accelerate the realization. Therefore, when listing six methods in the implementation proposal, there are two issues worth considering.</p>
<p>First, how can we enable 80% of our illiterate compatriots to quickly acquire the literacy tools to arm their minds, strive for knowledge liberation, consolidate the anti-Japanese foundation, and enhance the strength of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction?</p>

<p>Fierce Fighting in Southern Shanxi</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Ji, 13th] According to a source in a certain place in central Shanxi, more than 10 enemy planes flew over Hongkou at around 7 pm on the 28th, spying at a very high altitude. The national emblem was not easy to identify. The local enemy troops, having been repeatedly bombed by our planes in recent days, assumed that our planes were coming and hurriedly lowered all the Rising Sun flags and fled in all directions. At that time, it was already late, and there was a strong wind. The enemy planes gradually descended due to unclear targets and made low-altitude flights. Seeing troops fleeing in a panic, they assumed that they were insulting our army and dropped all the bombs they carried. Explosions shook the area, and countless warriors were killed heroically under the mighty power.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 13th] On the morning of the 2nd, 600-700 enemy troops from Shicun Houwang (southeast of Anyi), under the cover of artillery fire, attacked a certain unit of our army at Zhangguodian Junjialing (south of Xia County), and released a large amount of poison gas. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, and we also suffered considerable casualties. The situation is still deadlocked. The enemy in Quwo continues to increase its forces to Yicheng, attempting to make a final struggle.

<p>Our Army Advances in Eastern Suiyuan</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Hecheng, 14th] Our army in eastern Suiyuan is advancing rapidly and has now reached the vicinity of Liangcheng. The highway between Liangcheng and Zhuozishan has been largely destroyed by us. The enemy in Liangcheng is very shaken.</p>

All five crew members were burned to death. In addition, a certain self-defense force of our army thoroughly destroyed the Anbei railway bridge and telegraph wires at the Qixiaying station. At that time, a unit of the enemy from various banners surrounded our army, but they were all repelled by our army. A total of six or seven li of nearby battle lines were destroyed by us.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Hecheng, 14th] The enemy in Anbei has increased its forces and is conscripting laborers outside the east gate to build an airport and erect telegraph wires. Our army is constantly attacking them, making it extremely difficult for the enemy to make progress on their projects. In addition, a certain unit of our army destroyed enemy transportation near Sudi Yuan and captured more than 60 puppet soldiers guarding the road.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Offensive in Guangdong is Exhausted</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 14th] Our guerrilla teams are extremely active along the Xinhe and Xinkai lines.

<h3>Gulangyu Enemy Landing Incident, Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement: Enemy's Purpose is to Test the Attitude of the Powers, Also a Prelude to Seizing the Shanghai Concession</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Chinese and foreign reporters visited Foreign Minister Wang of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and asked him to comment on the recent actions of the enemy in South China. He issued the following statement: The Japanese consul in Gulangyu was originally a member of the Gulangyu Municipal Council. Now, the Japanese army has landed in the Gulangyu concession without prior notice to the Municipal Council. Its intention is to test the attitude of the powers towards the Far East and is also a preliminary action for Japan to seize the Shanghai Joint Concession and other areas with similar status. Japan's contempt for the rights and interests of third countries is not the first time. Today, we can clearly understand that if the powers want their rights and interests not to be excluded from the Far East, their only strategy is to adopt sanctions and retaliatory measures against Japan, the aggressor.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] Secretary of State Hull told reporters that regarding the Gulangyu incident, the American consul in the area, Mr. McVitty, recently telegraphed that after the assassination of one of the members of the Xiamen Security Committee, 250 Japanese Marines occupied the Gulangyu Public Concession and arrested people everywhere. As for how the consul negotiated with the Japanese authorities, nothing is yet known.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Authorities Announce Disaster Relief Situation, 250,000 People Evacuated in Three Days, Strict Baobing System to be Established in the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A reporter visited a responsible official on the 14th to inquire about the disaster relief situation in Chongqing and the future plan for reorganizing the city's finances. He replied that after the enemy planes indiscriminately bombed the city on the 3rd, 4th, and 12th of this month, our Supreme Leader immediately allocated a large sum of money from the government for emergency relief. At the same time, he ordered party, government, and military agencies to organize service teams, concentrate vehicles and ships, and actively transport citizens away from the disaster area. Within three days, from the 5th to the 7th, the number of citizens evacuated, according to statistics, reached about 250,000. In the future, the number of citizens who will continue to leave voluntarily by free ships is not included in this number. After the citizens are evacuated to safe areas such as XX, the service team will either find houses for them to live in with local residents or guide them to temporary accommodation in reception centers established by the government. Their food, medicine, and security have also been arranged properly and in an orderly manner, which is very convenient for the citizens. Chongqing is our wartime capital, so Commander Liu (Zhi) specially transferred a certain unit of the army to work with the service teams of various agencies, following the instructions of Chief of Staff He (Yingqin), to actively clean up the disaster area and renovate the city. However, in order to reduce unnecessary sacrifices, the government will continue to work hard to evacuate the elderly, weak, women, and children, and various agencies that do not need to stay in Chongqing. As for the areas near Chongqing, those who cannot leave Chongqing due to production or work reasons will be investigated and registered by the authorities separately, and certificates will be issued. A strict Baobing system will also be established, and people will be assigned to lead it, so that the citizens who stay in Chongqing can carry out their work with peace of mind under an organized and planned situation, and work as usual. Now that Mayor He Guoguang has taken office, there will be more active measures in the city administration of Chongqing, our wartime capital, in the future. Under the guidance and supervision of the Supreme Leader, the order of society, the solemn atmosphere, and the tense work of public officials and the general public in this wartime capital are all expected.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 14th] The chargé d'affaires of the French and Belgian embassies in China, accompanied by three journalists, crossed the river to inspect the French naval barracks, which had been damaged by Japanese planes attacking Chongqing yesterday. While crossing the river in a small boat, it was accidentally hit by a steamship, and the boat broke in two. Everyone jumped into the river and struggled against the current, and were later rescued by Chinese boatmen. As a result of yesterday's air raid, the French naval barracks were not damaged, but a certain American business office nearby was destroyed by fire. Yesterday's air raid resulted in more than 300 deaths and injuries, and three Japanese planes were shot down.</p>
<h3>Gulangyu Plunges into a State of Terror</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 14th] After the Japanese Marines forcibly occupied Gulangyu, they searched houses one by one in the city yesterday and the day before, and our residents were poisoned by them and could not escape. Currently, hundreds of young people have been taken to Xiamen, and their lives and deaths are unknown. The city is full of Japanese military posts, and the Municipal Council is unable to exercise its police power. Chinese and foreign shops are all in the downtown area, plunged into a state of terror. British and American expatriates are also extremely frightened.</p>
<h3>Political Department of the Southwest Headquarters Strengthens Military-Civilian Cooperation, Six Key Points Ordered to be Followed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 14th] In order to strengthen military-civilian cooperation, the Political Department of the Southwest Headquarters has specially stipulated six key points to be followed: (1) Implement the Military-Civilian Cooperation Convention; (2) Hold an Anti-Japanese Oath Ceremony; (3) Hold a Military-Civilian Joint Celebration Meeting; (4) Vigorously Perform Services for the People; (5) Earnestly Implement the Military-Civilian Cooperation Method; (6) Use Local Administrative Organizations to Encourage Township Chiefs and Impartial Gentry to Lead the Masses in Comforting Wounded and Sick Soldiers, Providing Tea and Transportation Facilities to Troops Heading to the Front Lines or Undergoing Rearrangement, and Holding Welcome and Farewell Meetings.</p>
<h3>Shantou Air Raid</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shantou, 14th] This afternoon, Japanese planes attacked Shantou again. One bomb landed 200 yards west of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. The company was attacked by bomb fragments and machine guns. Several coolies were killed and injured. The British oil tanker "Hayton" and the small warship "Folkestone" sailed away amidst the dense machine gun fire, fortunately without loss.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shantou, 14th] Three Japanese planes attacked Shantou this morning, dropping bombs in various parts of the city. The number of casualties is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Bombed, Dozens Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 14th] Ignoring the protests of the American ambassador to Japan, the Japanese side sent seven planes yesterday to bomb the prosperous areas of Ningbo again, dropping sixteen bombs. The Quzhou (Ze Yin) Girls' School, the famous pagoda of Ningbo, and the private residence of the county magistrate were all hit, causing considerable damage. It is reported that more than 100 houses were destroyed, and dozens were killed and injured. Because of the evacuation of the population and proper hiding, the number of deaths and injuries was still small.</p>
<h3>From the Old Army to the New Army - An Interview with General Wang Jingguo</h3>
<p>— Cao Jin</p>
<p>[Minge Jinxi Correspondence] A certain army stationed in the 8th War Zone was the first to enter northern Shanxi, defending the Zhuanli and fighting in Xinkou. The officers and soldiers fought bravely and achieved miraculous feats, but suffered heavy losses. After the withdrawal from Taiyuan, seven or eight out of ten of the original troops were wounded or killed. The army then moved to western Shanxi, focusing on new replenishment, new command, new training, and new tactics, and taking advantage of the Battle of Xuzhou. Launching a counterattack against the enemy, they immediately captured the important town of Liulin. They have been stalemated with the enemy in Lishi and Zhongyang for ten months. During the Liulin battle last autumn, they made good use of new tactics, and the enemy fled with injuries, not daring to invade again. Recently, the enemy in Jinxi attacked Jingle on four routes. The army then coordinated with friendly forces to capture Jiaokou a few days ago - Jiaokou Town is the intersection of the Taiyuan Highway to Zhongyang, and its situation is extremely important; when the news of the victory came, everyone was delighted. The reporter visited the general in a certain place and extended deep congratulations and condolences, and was able to hear the general briefly describe the army's combat experience, saying, "The initial failure is not surprising; the future victory is in sight." Calm and steadfast, truly displaying the demeanor of a great general. The military history described by the general can also represent the general characteristics of the entire national revolutionary war, and is introduced as follows:</p>
<p>First Period: Retreat in the Battle of Positions</p>
<p>"The first stage of operations of this army was to prepare to enter Tongguan for the battle, taking on the task of defending the front of Yanmen Pass. Later, the battle situation changed, and the army retreated to the county, covering the concentration of our rear forces in Xinkou. The task was fairly completed, and the strength was already more than half lost. After reorganization, the army returned to Xinkou to fight. After these two battles, seven or eight out of ten soldiers were wounded or killed, and most of the company commanders were also wounded or killed. Of the regimental commanders, only one was left. The ferocity of the battle of positions and the appalling number of casualties were the result of the accumulated fear of more than ten years.</p>
<p>After withdrawing from Taiyuan, one independent brigade was replenished in Yangxian. Seeing that the enemy avoided Hanhuling, they took a two-wing encirclement on Linfen. The army hastily opened up the right pass of Damaijiao for defense. Although they had slightly thwarted the enemy, they suffered heavy losses, with 4,000 wounded, killed, or scattered. A certain heroic brigade commander also became a martyr in this battle."</p>
<p>Second Period: Mobile Warfare and Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>After Linfen fell, the division of defense zones began, and guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare were used. However, the main communication lines were all occupied by the enemy. Due to this factual predicament and need, although the army was not familiar with the new tactics, it was quite brave in experimenting. At that time, after the enemy besieged Jixian on eight routes, they continued to go deep, besieging Shilu on six routes, attempting to attack our headquarters. We had to find an opportunity to withdraw, and the enemy then attacked Yonghe, but was met with our fierce resistance. When the enemy retreated to Maozhi Mountain, they were ambushed by us again. In these two attacks, the ratio of enemy to our casualties was reversed. We also captured a large number of spoils, and then recovered Guanxian, Shilu, and Daning. This was due to the strong morale, and we did not regard the temporary retreat in tactics as a defeat. The application of the new fierce tactics was difficult at first, but this also proved its great effectiveness. The understanding of the cadres was strengthened as a result, and they no longer suspected that the "Four New Education" (Note: that is, new replenishment, new command, new training, and new tactics) was not beneficial to the public and harmful to oneself.</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with the Battle of Xuzhou, our army unanimously adopted an offensive. This army first captured Jundu and Liulin, and also frequently attacked the enemy in Lishi and Zhongyang, all with minor victories. The morale was greatly boosted, which laid the foundation for the victory in Liulin in September of last year. At that time, the enemy was attacking Wuhan, but could not succeed. In order to contain our army's strength, they declared that they would invade our Great Northwest, one route of which was to attack Jundu, making a tentative crossing.</p>
<p>Previously, the enemy had increased its forces in Fen and Li to about 5,000 or 6,000 troops, and went north from Dawu, feigning an attack on Lin County. We noticed their treachery and sent out a team to attack first. The enemy also sent troops back to respond. We slightly engaged them on the front and then scattered into the mountains on both sides. The enemy, with its arrogant army, went straight to Jundu, but was attacked from all sides by us, and immediately withdrew to Liulin. They also attacked Daning, where our headquarters was located. Our army in the north then took the opportunity to attack Liulin, killing one enemy regimental commander and one deputy commander of the station. The enemy returned and attacked north, shelling for two days without a target. Our army in the south then approached Liulin again. The enemy did not leave the city. Our two wings simultaneously launched a counterattack, and the communication line between Liu and Li was controlled by us. The enemy then fled Qin City, and we pressed on in pursuit, holding the line with the enemy in a certain place west of Lishi City. On the "Double Twelfth" Memorial Day, and three days later - the anniversary of the fall of Nanjing - the enemy launched a combined land and air attack on Liulin. We already had the experience of the first time and made proper arrangements. We set up an ambush on two high grounds on the flanks and front, concentrated the main force on the rear front, and made a deep deployment. The enemy recklessly pressed into the shell, and we attacked from three sides, leaving more than 500 corpses and fleeing in disarray. Our army suffered only 80 to 90 casualties. At the end of last year, the enemy again attacked Jixian. The enemy attacking Shilu from the north by way of the central route withdrew halfway due to the pressure of our army in Liulin. Recently, the enemy launched a four-pronged siege of Jingle, with about 4,000 to 5,000 troops from Lishi via Dawu. Our army took the opportunity to recapture Jiaokou and destroyed six enemy bunkers and fortifications. We are currently searching and advancing in the direction of Lishi and Zhongyang. Even if we cannot recover them all, we can warn the enemy not to make the vain attempt to advance westward.</p>
<p>Third Period: Victorious Counteroffensive</p>
<p>After Commander Wang finished speaking, the reporter asked about the current situation in the war zone and the future prospects. Commander Wang gave a detailed analysis, saying: "Judging from the geographical situation and our forces' preparedness, the enemy on this route will never dare to peer into northern Shaanxi unless they can increase their forces to more than 50,000. Judging from the current war situation, the enemy is no longer able to go deep, but is trying to consolidate its occupied areas and prolong the stalemate. We must strike at them at any time to hasten their collapse and enter the counteroffensive stage as soon as possible. As for what the counteroffensive situation will be like, there is no need for empty talk today. By this time next year, it will be possible to supplement the narrative."</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Civilians; US Lodges Protest with Japan; China Branch of International Anti-Aggression League Reports on Atrocities by Enemy Planes to Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Hull recently released a statement to the press, briefly stating that after Japanese planes extensively bombed Chongqing, Shantou, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and other locations, the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has lodged a verbal protest with the Japanese government. This action is based on the consistent attitude that the US government condemns all acts of bombing ordinary civilians.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] To enable the world's populace to better understand the enemy's atrocities and to promote sanctions against Japan, the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League has telegraphed the General Anti-Aggression League in Geneva with factual details of the enemy's repeated air raids on Chongqing. The telegram specifically pointed out the enemy's despicable tactics as a sign of their increasingly weakened state. These tactics are not only ineffective, but also deepen the understanding of Chinese citizens regarding the enemy's cruel nature. The emotion of shared hatred grows stronger, and the determination to resist until the end becomes more resolute. The branch also earnestly requests the General League to find ways to promote the implementation of various proposals from the Paris Anti-Bombing of Undefended Cities Conference and to strengthen effective sanctions against the enemy.</p>
<h3>Proceedings of the National Production Conference</h3>
<p>— Zheng Bo</p>
<p>[Continental News Agency, Chongqing Express] Under the leadership of President Kong, the National Production Conference commenced on the 10th of this month and concluded successfully on the 13th. Over 120 officials from various ministries, representatives from agencies, and experts attended. The proposals were divided into (1) Agriculture, (2) Industry, (3) Continued Industries, (4) Transportation, Economics, and Other categories, totaling over 360 items. All of them are closely aligned with the needs of the wartime environment and are urgent priorities for completing the great task of resisting Japan and building the nation. National experts in agriculture, industry, finance, and economics gathered together in a tragic environment after the enemy's large-scale disturbances. They were diligent and dedicated, engaging with the most sincere and enthusiastic attitude in the research and planning to increase national production and cultivate national strength. The conference was filled with a spirit of unity and vigorous advancement, and the harmonious atmosphere demonstrated the bright future of China.</p>
<p>The convening of the Production Conference is essentially a review of past work and a promotion of future production. Its significance is as the conference declaration states: "Resisting Japan and building the nation, planning and advancing simultaneously, is the established national policy of the central government. Modern nations are founded on the three pillars of economics, education, and military strength. The victory or defeat in war is determined by the sustained supply of economic power, as clearly instructed by the Commander-in-Chief." Since the start of the war, our nation's military strength has grown stronger with each battle. The key priority today is to develop national production, so that the country's economic strength becomes increasingly abundant and can match this powerful national military force to strive for the victory of resistance and establish the foundation for national construction.</p>
<p>On the second day of the conference, Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally attended to give instructions, expressing admiration for the members who traveled long distances and made sacrifices to attend for the sake of the nation. He provided detailed and repeated instructions on the importance of production and conservation. The Commander-in-Chief gave thorough and clear instructions on economic construction, resource concentration, transportation development, and manpower utilization. He also encouraged all members to make efforts to increase production through academic research. All members expressed their joy and were deeply moved by the Commander-in-Chief's rare and approachable great personality.</p>
<p>The conference declaration was passed at the final meeting and will be fully published after slight revisions to serve as a reference for government policy implementation and for discussion among the people of the nation. The conference believes that China's economic construction has seen decades of effort, but significant effects have not been seen due to two main reasons: "First, before the establishment of the National Government, there was some construction but no planning. Second, after the establishment of the National Government, there was planning, but it was hampered by internal and external troubles, and long-term development was not possible." Now that the War of Resistance has begun, the nation is unified, internal troubles have been eliminated, and external troubles are mired in the mud. In the future, China's economic policy should absolutely adhere to the Principle of People's Livelihood, aim to solve the legitimate needs of the people's lives, and especially develop national capital, support private enterprises, and promote cooperative movements. At the same time, prevent the concentration of capital, and nationalize, democratize, and rationalize production enterprises to lay the foundation for the construction of a new China and cultivate the economic strength of the entire nation. Resistance and national construction are related to the nation's safety and survival. The government should adhere to the principles of military first, victory first, nation above all, and ethnicity above all, and plan the nation's production forces as a whole, ensuring that all kinds of necessities for the military and the people are produced in large quantities and endlessly to meet the needs of national defense and enhance the strength of resistance. There should be a comprehensive calculation of the types and quality of products, and there should be close connections between various production enterprises, making the entire national economic production a systematic and organized mobile entity. The basis for national revival lies in the interior of the Southwest and Northwest. Therefore, the economic construction of the rear is an urgent task. Before the war, the economic center of the country was in the Southeast. In the years after the war, the economic center of the country will be in the Southwest. Therefore, all economic construction in the rear should be based on planned calculations. The members of this conference believe that one of the central principles of the country's entire production policy in the future should be the economic construction of the Southwest, which should be recognized by the entire nation."</p>

<h3>Reviewing Past Work</h3>
<p>— Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>Promoting Future Production—Opening Address at the National Production Conference—</p>
<p>Fellow members, the opening date of this Production Conference was originally scheduled for May 5th, the day when the Premier assumed the post of Extraordinary Grand President eighteen years ago. The intention was to reflect on the Premier's spirit of hard work and struggle in those years and to dedicate ourselves to the current great cause of production and construction. However, due to the enemy's indiscriminate bombing of various places in our rear and the difficulty of transportation in the city, it was slightly postponed. Today's meeting coincides with the National Humiliation Day of May 7th, the day when Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai. From reflecting on the difficulties of building the nation and feeling the current oppression, we are even more aware of the importance of our future responsibilities. Under the two major goals of resistance and national construction today, we must constantly review, constantly encourage, and move forward with diligence and energy in our respective duties. The convening of the National Production Conference is based on this kind of motivation.</p>
<p>This is more important and more meaningful than any other kind of gathering during the war. The material supply needed for the war effort is vast, and the key to recent victories or defeats depends on whether economic resources can be sustained for a long time. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Chiang said, "Modern warfare is a final between nations of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Those whose economic resources can provide a sustained supply will win the final victory." For more than a year, the enemy has spared no effort to destroy our economy and finance. Fortunately, thanks to the government's efforts to cope and the people's enthusiastic support, inland economic construction is still continuing, and the credit of legal tender is becoming more and more consolidated. Recently, the price of counterfeit currency in North China has plummeted repeatedly. Although the enemy has exhausted all kinds of means to try to salvage it, they have ultimately failed. It should be noted that counterfeit currency and enemy currency belong to the same group. The plummeting price of counterfeit currency is equivalent to the plummeting price of enemy currency. From this perspective, our country has already defeated the enemy in the economic aspect. If we can continue our efforts, work hard to produce, and continuously supply and strengthen our material and financial resources, then we will surely be able to win the war and achieve the goal of national construction. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has been aware of the huge consumption of war and the difficulty of the country's material resources. On the one hand, it has promoted conservation to reduce unnecessary consumption, and on the other hand, it has encouraged production to develop resources to supplement them. All domestic highway production enterprises are doing their utmost to promote and support them in order to reduce difficulties, strengthen their strength, and increase their efficiency. Such as assisting factory relocation, organizing agricultural and industrial loans, and subsidizing production capital, etc., are being done with the greatest effort and the greatest courage. In order to be convenient to use and quickly effective, in addition to the competent ministries urging and handling, the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee and the Industrial Cooperation organizations have also been established to engage in production work. However, although the promotion is strong, its effectiveness still needs a thorough review in order to correct shortcomings and develop reasonably and smoothly. Therefore, the purpose of convening this conference is to "review past work and promote future production." Now, I would like to put forward a few opinions on these two goals for your reference.</p>
<p>First, the establishment of a production plan. Regarding national economic construction, the Premier has already given detailed instructions, and we should take them as the law and strive to realize them. What we should ask for today is to increase the necessary production of various kinds on the one hand to meet the current needs and to strengthen the resistance force, and on the other hand to follow the legacy and establish a hundred-year plan to lay the foundation for national construction. Since the war of resistance, the government has paid attention to three things: First, the delimitation of regional economic plans, second, the coordination of state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, and third, the relief of agricultural and rural economies. China is vast and rich in resources, and large-scale production can be planned everywhere. However, the mutual coordination between the natural environment and the production enterprises also has a lot of room for choosing the good and the bad. Therefore, after the development plan of the economy is carried out, it should be vigorously corrected. Now the government has decided to select local sites in Sichuan Province for the first phase of industrial areas to be developed in light of the resources and transportation of the southwestern provinces to engage in the exploitation of coal mines, petroleum, and coal gas, and has established alcohol factories, power plants, chemical factories, etc., which are still in the planning stage, iron-making paper mills and sugar mills, etc. The signing of this regional economic plan is a major point in the current economic construction. Under the leadership of the People's Livelihood in the construction of the country, it is necessary to control private capital and prevent a small number of capitalists from monopolizing the market and controlling finance. Therefore, the government's economic plan is designed in accordance with the Premier's legacy of heavy industry and national defense industries, with state-owned industries as the principle, and light industries with government-encouraged private enterprises as the principle. Now the main means of transportation in the country have long been reclaimed. The larger-scale mining areas, especially the mining areas related to national defense industries and heavy industries, have also been designated as state-owned areas. However, private enterprises must also do their utmost to promote and support them in order to cooperate and advance together. Therefore, the government has paid special attention to the revision of the Company Law, the encouragement of private enterprises, and the cooperation between officials and businesses. As for rural economic relief, we have been paying close attention to it before the war, such as promoting village cooperation, agricultural experiments, and establishing agricultural banks. Since the outbreak of the war, the work of the Agricultural Bank has been even more important in the southwestern provinces, such as establishing county cooperative treasuries, organizing agricultural loans, investing in agricultural farmland and water conservancy, purchasing cotton yarn, cotton cloth, food, and transporting them to the rear, etc. has been developing for many years and will continue to work hard to achieve universal results in the future. However, whether these plans are perfect is related to the future of the business, which is of great importance, and it is urgent to consider the social situation and carefully review it based on personal experience. Special attention should be paid to the following two things:</p>

<h3>Anti-Aggression Negotiations Still Actively Underway; Soviets to Reply to British Proposals; Mussolini's Speech Uses Moderate Language</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Diplomatic circles believe that the international situation has improved slightly since the weekend. The most important factor is the finalization of the Anglo-Turkish agreement. The Anglo-Soviet negotiations are also showing signs of progress. Chamberlain's and Daladier's clear declarations, coupled with the axis's taciturnity, make them appear subdued. Whether the situation can continue to improve depends on Mussolini's speech tomorrow. According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the Anglo-Turkish agreement is sufficient to change the situation in the Balkans significantly. It not only has a stabilizing effect on Yugoslavia, but also has a marked reaction on Bulgaria. The Anglo-Turkish agreement clearly dispels Bulgaria's dreams of obtaining access to the Aegean port and revising its northern border. However, it is believed that Bulgaria will also feel that maintaining peace is better than war, and its sympathies are gradually separating from the totalitarian states and leaning towards the anti-aggression front. The change in Bulgaria's attitude is probably due to the axis powers' increasing belief that they have long planned to dismember Greece, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria to establish an independent Macedonian state. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin is now going to Geneva to meet Halifax and Bonnet, which is also a clear sign of progress in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and various parties. Some quarters believe that the Soviet authorities will continue to demand that, in addition to the scope agreed upon, other borders of the Soviet Union be guaranteed. Diplomatic circles believe that Poland will agree to provide guarantees to the Baltic states, and the Baltic states will not reject such guarantees once they are offered. As for how and when the British and French governments will provide these guarantees to them, there is still no sign of this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Kaunas, 13th] It is reported that relations between the Soviet Union and the Baltic States are becoming increasingly close. It is said that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin will visit the Baltic States after the League of Nations meeting, and the Soviet ambassador to Lithuania, who has been suspended for a year, will also be dispatched soon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The diplomatic correspondent of the "Observer" wrote today that the Soviet government will not wait for Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to meet with British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Geneva, but will first send to the British government the results of its observations on the recent British proposals. It is expected that this reply will arrive in London at the beginning of this week. It is reported that the main motive of the Soviet Union is to express concern about the danger of delaying negotiations. In view of the desire to conclude an agreement with the British government as soon as possible, the Soviet government will indicate its willingness to accept modifications in terms of form or wording, but will still repeatedly insist on its main idea, namely, to conclude a British, French, and Soviet military alliance to resist German aggression.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 14th] According to newspapers here this morning, the United Kingdom will invite Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov or Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to London for negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Mussolini delivered a speech here, stating, "Millions of people are now asking whether we will move towards war or peace. This is a serious question, especially for those who are responsible for deciding between war and peace. Today's fascism is stronger than ever before. Regarding the problems of Europe, we will seek solutions with Germany. We also want to invite democratic countries to express fair opinions on our views. Italy ardently supports peace. Are democratic countries also like our country? We really cannot help but be suspicious. Democratic countries have now begun an economic war against us, which shows that they do not ardently protect peace. But we will defeat these countries with perseverance and will. Any attacks against us will be ineffective. The guarantee system will also be damaged. What doubts do we have about the future? No matter what happens, we will be able to achieve all our goals."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Reuters has learned that the impression of Mussolini's speech in diplomatic circles here is not entirely satisfactory. It is believed that the speech uses moderate language and will not affect the current situation. It is worth noting that Mussolini's speech did not mention Danzig, Poland, the Anglo-Turkish agreement, and demands to France.</p>
<h3>Turkish Parliament Approves Anglo-Turkish Cooperation Plan; Prime Minister Reports on Importance of Agreement; Neutrality Impossible in a Critical Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] A telegram was received from the Turkish capital stating that at the Turkish Parliament meeting on the 12th of this month, the government submitted a detailed report on the Anglo-Turkish negotiated agreement, which was extremely satisfactory to the British after learning of it. It is said that at the Turkish Parliament meeting, the Turkish Prime Minister first explained the importance of the Anglo-Turkish agreement in Turkish history, briefly stating that recent events in the world have progressed rapidly. Turkey originally wanted to take a neutral policy, but the development of events has extended to the Balkans and the security of the eastern Mediterranean, and Turkey is also in a critical situation. Although it wants to maintain neutrality, it is impossible. The Mediterranean should be jointly owned by all countries based on equal footing. Anyone who attempts to interfere with this common political power will endanger Turkish security. I (the Prime Minister referring to himself) now request the Parliament to authorize the government to promise that Turkey will cooperate with the United Kingdom to save the world from the scourge of war. The Prime Minister finally stated that if necessary, the Turkish navy and army will jointly protect peace in the Mediterranean with the British army. After the Prime Minister's speech, the Parliament immediately passed a vote of confidence in the government, approving the government's policy of establishing friendship and close cooperation with the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>German Newspapers Attack British Diplomacy</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The reaction of the Nazi newspapers to the Anglo-Turkish agreement today is the same as their criticism of the Anglo-Polish agreement a few days ago. They mostly express disagreement with Turkey's single-mindedness and attack it with distrust. They claim that Germany believes that this new agreement is a further expression of Chamberlain's proposed movement, namely, the so-called "encirclement policy against the Axis powers, and this time it first starts with Italy." Generally speaking, the trend is that Germany is naturally deeply disappointed with Turkey's close proximity to democratic countries. Some Nazi newspapers said that this agreement will cause a crisis in Turkey. The Nazi officials have not yet made any criticism for the time being. According to foreign views, it is necessary to obtain the full text of the agreement before a statement can be issued. However, a certain semi-official newspaper (the newspaper is published only on special occasions) said that the United Kingdom is now using "coercion and inducement" to forcefully provide protection to various countries, and said that Turkey should understand that Germany and Italy are not only inseparable partners in the military, but also indestructible fortresses. No matter now or in the future, any united front will not be enough to affect the policy of the Axis powers.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Arrives in England to Meet Halifax; Discuss British-Soviet Negotiations; Delivers Speech Praising Anglo-French Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 14th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet arrived in England by plane yesterday, expressing close cooperation with the United Kingdom to maintain the common interests of the two countries.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 13th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet said in a speech at a luncheon of the French Alliance in Southampton today, "The front line of the United Kingdom has not only expanded to the Rhine, but now extends to the Vistula River" (the Vistula River is in Poland). Bonnet flew from Paris to Southampton with his secretary. In his speech, he tried his best to show France's efforts to expand its military. All factories related to national defense have resumed the system of working 60 hours a week. Bonnet said that the French government extended the term of military training for reserve soldiers, and the reserve soldiers were able to show a spirit of no complaint, which is admirable. The friendship between Britain and France is due to each other's determination to protect national defense, so it is even closer. Bonnet praised the British for being able to resolutely break traditional habits and accept compulsory military service. After the luncheon, Bonnet went to London and will meet with British Foreign Secretary Halifax. It is reported that the two will focus on discussing the British-Soviet negotiations.</p>
<p>Another Conflict on the Border of Manchukuo</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] According to a message from Changchun yesterday, on Thursday, more than 100 Outer Mongolian troops entered the territory of Manchukuo near Lake Bel, crossed the Khalkha River, and attacked the Manchukuo border guards. The two armies held each other for several hours. The Outer Mongolian soldiers were repelled, five died, and the number of casualties on the Manchukuo side is not yet known. Such incidents occurred once in early May, so the number of Manchukuo border guards has been greatly increased.</p>
<h3>US Interdepartmental Committee Asks for Improvement of the Air Force; Plan Submitted to Roosevelt; Develop Civil Aviation to Enhance National Defense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The Interdepartmental Committee has submitted a plan to President Roosevelt to improve the status of the US Air Force and make the United States a strong air force country. The plan first calls for an immediate doubling of the number of mechanical engineers in existing aircraft manufacturing plants, about 40,000, so that 500,000 pilots can be quickly obtained in wartime. According to the "New York Times", another interdepartmental committee will soon submit a plan to develop civil aviation to enhance national defense.</p>
<h3>National Production Conference Proceedings (Continued from Page 3)</h3>
<p>His Excellency issued an order stating that agriculture, industry, transportation, and commerce are the mainstays of future national economic construction. Therefore, in the declaration, a summary of each is presented. In addition, several matters that must be paid attention to in the development of production are (1) capital, trade, and finance; (2) labor; (3) production and education, with detailed explanations. The conclusion is: "The President has wisely pointed out that our country's resistance base is not in the shallow, narrow communication zones along the coast, but in the vast and deep inland areas. The southwestern and northwestern provinces are especially the source of our resistance strategy. Only the development of transportation and economy in the southwest and northwest can provide a solid foundation for long-term resistance and national reconstruction. This National Production Conference is held at a time when the soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles and launching counter-offensives, achieving success and under the heavy threat of enemy aircraft's bombing. We, the members of this conference, mindful of the severity of the national crisis and deeply aware of our individual responsibility, have exhausted our thoughts and deliberated day and night, hoping to contribute our meager efforts to the development of transportation and economy in the southwest and northwest. We reverently admire the President's grand vision for the country and also comfort the government's earnest expectations. The realization of this great historical mission and the shouldering of this arduous responsibility rely on the concerted efforts of the entire nation. We, the members of this conference, must devote our hearts and minds and respectfully follow the people of the country and work hard. We hope that the government and the public will devote their attention and effort, ensure that the plans are practical, economize on expenses, and ensure the success of the undertakings. We must work diligently and practically to achieve success. The revitalization of the country, after a century of difficulties, has an ancient saying: 'Continuing the past and opening up the future, the responsibility lies with us.' The past two years of resistance have allowed us to gain unlimited practical experience and inspiration amidst hardship and struggle. It has also allowed us to deeply realize that our Chinese nation, nurtured by the divine spirits of Yan and Huang, will surely overcome great difficulties and stand firmly on its own in today's world, illuminating our nation with a new destiny. Future national construction will surely prove the greatness of the creative power of our Chinese nation, capable of completing China's production revolution with its remaining strength amidst the national resistance, establishing the new Chinese production system and realizing the central government's national policy of resisting while building. Let us all strive together for the nation."</p>

<h3>Italian-Romanian Negotiations Plan to Revise Trade Agreement, German-Romanian Exchange of Goods</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, 14th] According to the "Lun Huaibao", the Romanian Minister of Finance, who met with Mussolini on Friday, is currently conducting important negotiations with the Italian government to plan the revision of the Italian-Romanian trade agreement of December last year. The report also stated that Romania will exchange flour, livestock, petroleum, and timber for Italian artificial fiber machinery and furniture. A group of young personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank will be sent to Italy for observation.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th] Germany and Romania have now concluded an agreement. Romania will exchange timber for German machinery. The signing date will be next month.</p>
<h3>Conflict Occurs on the Bulgarian-Romanian Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] A border conflict has occurred in Southern Dobruja, causing anger in Bulgaria. It is reported that in the conflict, Romanian gendarmes killed twenty-three Bulgarians. However, the Romanian side stated that Bulgarians crossed the border to cause trouble and attacked Romanian farms. They were immediately arrested by Romanian gendarmes. However, during the escort through the forest, gunshots were suddenly heard. The gendarmes, believing they were being ambushed, immediately returned fire, resulting in the death of twenty-three Bulgarians. The Romanian Embassy in Sofia has been heavily guarded to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>German-Italian Military Agreement, Term Set for Ten Years, To Be Signed on the 20th of This Month, Court Spain to Resist British Agreement</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th] According to well-informed sources here yesterday, the German-Italian military agreement may be signed on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] "Le Matin" today published a report from Rome stating that the German-Italian military and political agreement was initiated by Hitler. It is reported that the military part of the agreement was drafted by Hitler. The agreement is for a term of ten years and can be revised after the term expires. The report stated that the military part of the agreement is as follows: (1) In the event of a European war, Germany and Italy will immediately discuss military measures. (2) The countries signing the military agreement agree to consider common interests. Once war breaks out, Germany and Italy will immediately form a military alliance and unify military actions and command. (3) Germany and Italy will cease military actions only with mutual consent. The political part is based on the principle of the German-Italian axis, but Germany added two points: (1) Each ally shall respect the friendly relations of the other party with third countries existing after the conclusion of treaties. (2) Germany and Italy will not unilaterally conclude new treaties with other countries without mutual consultation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The "Times" correspondent in Berlin reported on Sunday that the result of the British-Turkish agreement will cause the German-Italian axis to enthusiastically court Spain. Since the end of the Spanish war, German writers have exaggerated Spain's military strength and military importance, as if Spain had already joined the German-Italian axis. However, Spain has only concluded a cultural treaty with Germany, in addition to joining the Anti-Comintern Pact. Observers here believe that Germany and Spain will soon conclude a military alliance and at the same time conclude a new trade agreement to further strengthen the economic relations between the two countries.</p>

<h3>Poland Prepares for War, Authorities Issue Statement, Resist Attempts to Seize Danzig</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Warsaw, 14th] Polish authorities issued a stimulating announcement stating that Polish troops are in a state of readiness, preparing to resist any attempt to seize Danzig. This warning is purely directed at the Nazi plot to instigate a "rebellion" in Danzig. Well-informed sources claim that the Polish government considers this statement necessary because the authorities have received reports that the Nazis in Danzig believe that the Polish side will not take "active actions" even when the next general vote is held in Danzig. At the same time, political observers are waiting for the demonstration march scheduled to be held in Danzig tonight, from which the general attitude of Germany can be seen.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th] Poland issued a warning stating that if Danzig attempts to join Germany, Poland will send troops. However, Nazi Party sources here indicated that the Danzig problem will be resolved soon, as the Nazi parliamentarians in Danzig stated that Danzig will issue an announcement, determined to return to Germany, and that "when the fact arrives," the Polish authorities will not take military action. It was also said that even if Poland sends troops, the 50,000 fully armed Nazi troops in Danzig can prevent the Polish troops from advancing and wait for the arrival of the German army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 13th] According to sources here, the windows of Polish restaurants, shops, and residences in Danzig were smashed tonight. The evening newspaper criticized the Danzig Senate, stating that its attitude is close to provocative and that it has no ability to restrain the public. One newspaper said that Polish public opinion found evidence of the Danzig authorities' malice in the attitude of the Danzig Senate, and that they are trying to incite disputes between the Polish and Danzig people.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] A Reuters correspondent on board the Australian Queen reported today that the ship had changed course twice due to encountering icebergs. At 12:30 PM, the ship's whistle sounded three times, indicating a change of direction. After the heavy fog cleared, another iceberg was spotted, and the ship changed course again. After the fog cleared today, a large iceberg was found about a quarter of a mile from the ship. The crew was able to maintain a good spirit thanks to the Queen's cheerful demeanor. The Queen spoke to the crew about the icebergs, saying, "This situation is similar to Arctic exploration."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] A Reuters correspondent on board the Australian Queen reported that another large ice floe was spotted last night, but the ship is apparently about to sail out of the iceberg area.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Expanding the Production Movement</h3>
<p>The National Production Conference, under the leadership of President Kong, opened on the 10th of this month and concluded successfully on the 13th. More than 120 officials from various ministries, representatives of institutions, and experts gathered together amidst the tragic environment after enemy planes' wanton destruction to jointly plan the ways to increase production power and complete the task of resisting Japan and building the nation. This demonstrated the spirit of great unity among agricultural workers and experts in finance and economics throughout China. The highest leader also attended and gave instructions, further inspiring the conference's spirit of strengthening unity and adhering to resistance. We would like to express our highest and warmest respect on behalf of the people.</p>
<p>This conference received more than 360 proposals, divided into agriculture, industry, transportation, economy, and other categories. As a result of the conference, many appropriate decisions were made, which will surely make a significant contribution to the future of resisting Japan and building the nation. The conference declaration particularly cited President Chiang's instructions: "Modern countries are based on three pillars: economy, education, and military force." "The victory or defeat of war depends on the duration of economic power and supply." It resolutely advocated: "Developing national production in conjunction with strong national military force to strive for victory in the war of resistance and establish a foundation for national construction." These are the basic principles of China's production movement and economic construction in the future, and they should also be sincerely supported by the people of the country.</p>
<p>What we want to express our enthusiasm and expectations here is that firstly, the government authorities and those involved in production enterprises must follow these basic principles in the future, be practical and serious, eliminate obstacles, and move forward bravely, striving to fully achieve the high goal of making production enterprises serve the persistence of long-term resistance and the establishment of a Republic of the Three Principles of the People. Secondly, in order to effectively achieve this highest goal and expand the production movement, we must not rely solely on government agencies and the power of a few capitalists and experts. The main thing is to develop the initiative and enthusiasm of the people of the country so that they can fight to the end for the great production movement, that is, to concentrate talent and concentrate manpower. Here, it depends first of all on eliminating the bureaucratic habits and malpractice of the past. We must eliminate the concepts and prejudices of parties, systems, and sectarianism, and boldly and massively promote young cadres who have a correct political understanding and fighting spirit, and who are rich in both experience and knowledge. At the same time, it is also necessary to universally and effectively grant all members engaged in expanding the production movement democratic rights, improved living conditions, and opportunities to enjoy wartime production education, political education, and collective learning.</p>
<p>In addition, the article "Intensify Production, Persist in Resistance" published on the editorial page of this newspaper yesterday and the day before yesterday is also a valuable reference material for those of us who are engaged in expanding the production movement in the future, and we hope that it will not be taken lightly.</p>

<h3>Rampant Smuggling on the Sino-British Border, Large Amounts of Defense Raw Materials Smuggled into Hong Kong, Tungsten Sand, Ramie, Scrap Copper, and Iron Reach Thousands of Tons per Month</h3>
<p>The border between the New Territories and the British and Chinese sides has always been a haven for smuggling activities. Although it had once subsided, it has recently resurfaced and has become extremely rampant. In the past, only nighttime joint operations were carried out, but recently, they have been frequent day and night. These smugglers believe that the current situation is turbulent, that our anti-smuggling network has been torn apart by the enemy, and that the customs anti-smuggling operations are inevitably more relaxed than before. They consider this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and greatly expand their smuggling operations, especially on the water. Although the Kowloon Customs is paying special attention to anti-smuggling along the border, their efforts are difficult to extend to some sea areas due to enemy warships running rampant. They cannot help but find other ways to patrol the British waters or the Sino-British border. However, the smugglers are extremely cunning, and this method is of little effect. Therefore, they dare to smuggle openly, taking advantage of opportunities to cross over. There is nothing that can be done about them. Although the situation on land is not as bad as in Shanghai, the activities are mostly carried out at night, making it difficult to catch them. Moreover, the smugglers use their financial power to collude with others everywhere, with accomplices spread across major stations, making their information very nimble and allowing them to avoid dangers.</p>
<p>Smuggling is Rampant on Both Land and Sea</p>
<p>Investigations have revealed that the smuggling operations on land involve main figures searching for various target items in the interior, then transporting them to villages near the British border for storage. They then hire local accomplices to carry the goods by shoulder along secluded paths directly to New Territories for storage. Then they split the items into batches that are shipped to Hong Kong. During the smuggling process, they travel in groups as though they were local farmers enjoying the countryside. Several armed guards follow behind, making the organizational structure very tight. If the customs officials discover and try to arrest them, they will fire their guns to resist. The accomplices will be able to escape from the scene. This kind of event has occurred countless times along the Sino-British border. As for the maritime side, their accomplices also search for smuggled items, hire boats to carry them over. Since the start of the war, most civilian boats have not dared to travel to the interior due to enemy arson, and most merchants are also afraid to hire boats to transport goods. As a result, people in general boats have no way to make a living and have no choice but to become tools for the smugglers, taking the risk to be hired or working together to smuggle various items for export, knowingly violating the law. According to the reporter's investigation, many boats dare to engage in smuggling in the harbor.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Flowing In Steadily</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the situation, the main items smuggled into Hong Kong from the interior by smugglers are government-prohibited or controlled export defense raw materials, of which tungsten ore, ramie, scrap copper, and scrap iron are the largest. The amount of each item reaches several hundred tons per month. The amount of tungsten ore is even greater, because the price of this raw material is the highest and the profit is also the highest. Each load can earn at least fifty or sixty Hong Kong dollars. Because foreign merchants are competing to buy the raw materials, the prices only rise and never fall. Therefore, there is no need to worry about not being able to make a huge profit. Moreover, most of the above-mentioned raw materials are pre-ordered by foreign merchants once they are smuggled into Hong Kong. They are doing their best to collect as much as possible. Among the smugglers, many have close relationships with foreign merchants. Smuggling activities have been going on steadily. According to reliable statistics, an average of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 tons of tungsten sand, ramie, scrap copper, and iron are transported to Hong Kong each month. The enormity of this number can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>× Vessel in Port Intercepts and Searches British Ship Again; Yunnan and Kunming Vessels Searched Successively; Goods Searched and Thrown into Disarray, Hong Kong Newspapers All Tossed into the Sea</h3>
<p>× Since invading us, [they] have constantly harassed and searched foreign merchant ships along the coast, even to the point of detaining and seizing them, showing no fear of the law. At present, this kind of evil conduct is not only continuing but intensifying. Yesterday, the Taikoo vessel "Yunnan" departed from Hong Kong for Shantou. After leaving Hong Kong and arriving at the mouth of Ma Island, it was again surrounded and intercepted by × vessels. The cargo was searched, resulting in extreme disarray. All Hong Kong newspapers on board were thrown into the sea. The shipowner immediately telegraphed a report to Hong Kong. Numerous × soldiers boarded the vessel and searched for about ten minutes before leaving resentfully. According to another source, the "Kunming" vessel, which departed from Hong Kong for Shantou the other day, was also intercepted and searched by × vessels en route, and all Hong Kong daily newspapers were also thrown into the sea.</p>
<h3>No More Infectious Diseases in Chaozhou and Shantou, But Ships Still Need to be Inspected Upon Arrival in Hong Kong; Third-Class Passengers Find Procedures Extremely Troublesome; Chaozhou Community Plans to Request Cancellation of This Rule Again</h3>
<p>Last year, due to the epidemic prevailing in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas, the Hong Kong government announced that third-class passengers on ships from Chaozhou and Shantou must be inspected before they could disembark. This rule has not been abolished to this day. Months ago, the chairmen of the Chaozhou Eight Districts and Jia Ying two chambers of commerce in Hong Kong visited the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, stating that there were indeed no infectious diseases in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas, and that the inspection procedures for third-class passengers from there were extremely troublesome, requesting permission to abolish it. However, the Hong Kong government did not approve it, believing that this rule should continue to be implemented. Yesterday, a person in charge said that various Chaozhou groups in Hong Kong are now planning to jointly send a letter to the Chinese representatives in Hong Kong, asking them to forward the request to the Hong Kong government for cancellation, and at the same time, they plan to jointly visit the Secretary for Chinese Affairs.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the City Planning Board, a Decision to Divide Hong Kong and Kowloon into Zones, Designating Locations for Industry, Commerce, and Housing, and Improving Housing for Residents; The Design Committee Has Already Internally Designated Todd to Serve as Chairman</h3>
<p>Hong Kong is small in area and densely populated. For decades, the authorities have exhausted much effort on the housing problem, but still, there has been no improvement. People of the middle and lower classes live in narrow, cramped rooms, with several family members living, sleeping, standing, and sitting within a small space. Although it is much more comfortable than those who use a space the size of a chessboard as a bedroom, Hong Kong is a modern city, and the housing problem of its residents should be vigorously improved.</p>
<p>Improving Residents' Housing Problems</p>
<p>The current issue of the Hong Kong Government Gazette publishes a draft of the City Planning Ordinance of 1939. At the next meeting of the Legislative Council, the Attorney General, Mr. Anli, will propose a first reading for its passage. It is expected that the third reading of this ordinance will pass and be implemented. After this ordinance becomes law, the first step will be to improve the housing problem of residents. The location of factories and shops, the flow of air, light, and everything else, do not meet health standards and indirectly greatly harm the welfare of residents. The authorities have attached considerable importance to this, and the problem of slums is also what the authorities are eager to solve. Previously, the only way to deal with slums was to evict the poor or burn their shacks. This kind of solution is harmful and without benefit. After the poor are evicted, they cannot but seek shelter in other remote and empty places. Advocates of forced solutions will feel like trying to burn off grass that cannot be completely eradicated by a prairie fire. Now, the authorities seem to be well aware that the previous methods could only treat the symptoms. Now, with the establishment of the City Planning Board, it is necessary to seek ways to treat the root cause, to find ways to settle these people, so that the city's appearance can be tidied up and hygiene work can proceed unimpeded.</p>
<p>Zoning of Hong Kong and Kowloon</p>
<p>According to what the reporter knows, the official and non-official members of the City Planning Board have already been internally decided. Once the ordinance is officially passed, the formal appointment will be made. The Chairman of the Municipal Health Bureau, Mr. Todd, will concurrently serve as the chairman of the committee. After the establishment of the committee, it will first conduct zoning work, designating industrial areas, commercial areas, residential areas, and areas for other uses in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is said that the industrial area will be selected at Ma Tau Kok, which is a semi-developed area with a vast area. Factories that have already been established there include a gas mask factory and a canned food factory. Nearby there are also slaughterhouses, steamships, small-scale docks, and a cement factory. After being designated as an industrial area in the future, if residents want to build houses in this area, the authorities will certainly allow it, but the environment does not seem suitable for building houses. As for residential areas, the authorities will prevent the establishment of factories in or near these areas. As for how the authorities will develop and improve the urban area, the steps cannot be known until the ordinance is passed and the City Planning Board officially starts working. In the United Kingdom and the United States, the establishment of urban improvement is the responsibility of a city planning board, and urban planning experts have emerged as a result. The City Planning Board in Hong Kong has not yet decided to hire planning experts to assist in the work, but there is no shortage of people in Hong Kong who are slightly familiar with this field. A planner from the Public Works Department has received a city planning certificate. He is currently on vacation in the United Kingdom. If it is deemed necessary to hire experts in the future, it will be decided to look for suitable candidates in the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3>Moving Towards a Common Goal: A Pledge from the Hong Kong Spoken Drama World</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>More than Five Hundred Drama Workers Held a Meeting at Po Hing Theatre Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>This is a great action under a great call.</p>
<p>More than forty drama groups and more than five hundred drama workers from all over Hong Kong sat silently in the middle of the Po Hing Theatre. Compared to their usual active presence on stage in makeup, their positions were exactly reversed.</p>
<p>The eras of China Salvation, China Art, and China Travel, the Guangdong Theatre, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association... artists all gathered together, a grand gathering. The neat uniforms and badges of China Salvation were particularly eye-catching, and many male and female friends from China Art and China Travel were also particularly noticeable.</p>
<p>The stage was simply but splendidly decorated. Chen Ce, Zhong Tianxin, and the presidium including Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Jinshan, Zhong Qinan, Huang Ninglin, Tan Guochi, Li Hua, Lu Dun, Tang Huaiqiu, and Shi Biao Gong Jiabao sat in an arc. Tang Huaiqiu and his team members sat below.</p>
<p>The meeting was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. The ceremony and the oath of the National Covenant proceeded solemnly according to the order, with Jiang Ming as the master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>Chairman Mr. Hu Chunbing delivered the opening speech. First, he explained the meaning of spiritual mobilization, then described the era mission of drama workers, and finally earnestly encouraged everyone to use every minute and every second, every drop of blood and sweat, to contribute to the final victory of the national liberation movement. This was a manifestation of Mr. Hu's practical action, and it is known that he is a firm believer in this conviction.</p>
<p>Central Committee member Chen Ce extended the comparison of us × in military, political, diplomatic, economic aspects... proving that the final victory must belong to us.</p>
<p>Mr. Tianxin told a story: When Guangzhou was evacuated, Mr. Zhong led more than a thousand young people to work in the inland areas. There were eleven children—from nine to fifteen years old, all elementary school students from good families—who set out with the team. When they arrived in Luoding and were about to transfer to Shaoguan, because of doubts about the strength of the children, they discouraged the children from continuing the Long March. The children replied, "Chairman Chiang said that there is no distinction between north and south, east and west, and there is no distinction between men and women, old and young. Children also have children's work." The adults were deeply moved and finally let them follow. They walked for twelve days from Luoding to Shaoguan, and the children's spirits were very strong. Working in Shaoguan, they deeply moved people everywhere. How could children have such strength far surpassing adults? It was because the children's spiritual mobilization had already made a determination. The children's performance in drama was unexpectedly successful. From this, we can know the importance of spiritual mobilization and drama. Based on this concrete example, the significance of this joint drama workers' National Covenant oath is explained.</p>
<p>Then he said: The greatest power that changed the old appearance of the poor and remote countryside after the war of resistance was drama. Mobilizing the masses is an important condition for winning the final victory. The mobilization work is still not done enough, and it depends on the efforts of drama workers. It is very difficult to develop drama work in the inland areas. Directors, scripts... all kinds of problems arise. In Hong Kong, however, it is very convenient, and I hope everyone will provide assistance. This was a very practical speech, which was met with a warm round of applause. The photographer of China Salvation kept running around the venue, busy without end. They were preparing to bring the glory of the motherland to Nanyang to comfort the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The speeches seemed to be coming to an end, and everyone seemed reluctant to leave this unprecedented gathering. As the applause rang out, Mr. Jinshan, the head of China Salvation, began a speech that electrified the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"First, spiritual mobilization must be followed by unity and organization. All those who are anti-Han can unite together. Today's gathering is a representation of unity and the beginning of organization. Second, don't let today's oath become an excited farewell; it must be thoroughly persisted in. Finally, he said very earnestly: We, the friends of China Salvation, are willing to follow you and fight to the death for the War of Resistance." Sincere feelings expressed in drama are good dramas with content; expressed in speeches, they are good speeches with content.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's words were opened.</p>
<p>"What Comrade Jinshan said about unity is very important. This performance in Huanghuagang is a symbol of unity. The various drama groups are different because of their history, economy, and the personality of their leaders. Some are unexpectedly successful, some are step-by-step, some are working nervously, and some are working steadily. As long as we are moving towards the common goal of the War of Resistance and national construction, it doesn't matter if the style and methods are different. We should put ourselves in their shoes and not use excessive standards to measure everything. For example, if someone is performing a certain second-rate play in Shanghai, he has received a warning and it is not easy to continue performing. If you still criticize such a performance as not enough based on a too-high standard, wouldn't it discourage people—isolating yourself and looking down on others, what difference is there from the ivory tower of the past!</p>
<p>Regarding supplementing Mr. Zhong's words, Mr. Ouyang also said well:</p>
<p>It is very difficult to develop spoken drama in Hong Kong. We hope that everyone has a unified organization. In a public place, we can practice singing, practice rehearsing dramas, without distinguishing each other. By then, we can become a supply station in Hong Kong, supplementing the needs of directors, scripts... all kinds of needs, our drama workers will certainly be in short supply. This is the actual situation. Mr. Ouyang also said based on objective facts: Our spoken drama is already better than Japan's, and even if it is moved to Europe and the United States, it is not necessarily inferior. We must not relax our work. Drama is a collective art, and the drama movement should be a collective action.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong Qinan felt compelled to stand up and say: "What is needed now is action to express ourselves, a collective action. Two-thirds of those present come from the mainland. We are comfortable here, and we must not forget the difficulties and suffering of the mainland." The atmosphere of the meeting became more and more tense. The applause seemed to mean that Gong Jiabao was being asked to speak. He also unreservedly represented China Travel and Mr. Tang Huaiqiu.</p>
<p>"The spirit of unity today is very moving. Under this difficult situation, I hope that one is to be united sincerely, and two is to be diligent and hardworking, to strive for the final victory." Again, there was a burst of warm applause.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Chunbing finally came to a conclusion: A great task is placed before us. We must first mobilize ourselves to mobilize the masses: we need collective action to launch a living drama movement. Today is the beginning of a great task.</p>
<h3>Rampant Human Trafficking in Shantou ××, Mostly Targeting Refugee Women and Children; Transported to the Straits Settlements and Other Ports</h3>
<p>During our country's War of Resistance, cities and villages were subjected to × bombings and devastation, and refugees were displaced everywhere. There are actually human traffickers taking advantage of the situation, mostly targeting the young women and men of disaster refugees who have no one to turn to, luring them abroad to the Straits Settlements, Siam, and other ports, in order to achieve their aim of trading in "piglets." These human trafficking agencies are currently very active in Hong Kong. According to yesterday's English newspaper report, the transport of young women and children between ports in southern China north of Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, Siam, and other ports is constant, with children being the most numerous. The main ports for exporting "piglets" are Shantou and Xiamen, the former being the main location. The report also said that Hong Kong was the hub for this kind of trafficking last year, but after a large agency was seized and the Immigration Department took strict precautions, the trafficking hub was moved to Shantou. It is now found that each batch of "piglets" transported from Shantou to Bangkok and Singapore numbers about fifty, mostly accompanied by old women who take care of them along the way. These "piglets" are trained to answer appropriately when questioned by the authorities, and all claim to be the children or relatives of someone at the destination. The agency is still active in Hong Kong, but on a smaller scale than last year. Immigration authorities are closely monitoring it. Recently, two old women requested to go to Singapore. The women, aged about fifty-three to fifty-six, both carried young children of several months, claiming they were their descendants. Subsequently, the authorities immediately sent the children to the Po Leung Kuk, and an investigation is underway. It is suspected that the old women are managers of the human trafficking operation.</p>
<h3>Contributing Money and Effort: The Life Choir Performed Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>In Response to the Short Clothes and Trousers Collection Campaign</p>
<p>Special Article in This Newspaper - "Life Choir" is an amateur singing group organized by "Life School."</p>
<p>They understand that in times like these, "singing for the sake of singing" is a regrettable thing: singing may be your best skill, then you should use this skill to do things that benefit the country and society; only then does your skill have value and meaning.</p>
<p>They have also used their choral skills to do something like this. They have participated in charity performances, done street plays, etc. However, this was the first time that a solo singing and drama recital was held at the Confucius Hall last night.</p>
<p>This time, they are raising money for the "Guangdong All Sectors Comforting Association" to collect short clothes and trousers to send to the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines. Their meeting method is worth introducing here: According to the announcement published in their special issue, "The proceeds from this performance will all be allocated to the Guangdong All Sectors Comforting Association. All expenses incurred due to the performance will be entirely borne by the members of the group..."</p>
<p>Good, good, good, giving both money and effort is a good model for disaster relief work. If everyone did it this way, the efficiency of the fundraising work would definitely double.</p>
<p>Although each item performed last night was a "first try," it was also very impressive. The choir was very skilled in the choral aspects. "Eight Hundred Warriors," "Grand Army March," "Manjianghong," "Final Victory is Ours," "　　　" "… Several songs were sung very well.</p>
<p>Wu Zixiang sang "Can't Return to My Hometown" solo. She sang very gently, and she won a warm round of applause.</p>
<p>There were two one-act plays in the drama performance. The first one, "Two Wounded Soldiers," wrote a story about military-civilian cooperation. It was done very standardly.</p>
<p>The second one, "The Signal Sounded," wrote about a father and children in a guerrilla area responding to the call to kill the ×. Although the father was injured and died in the incident, the children stepped on the glorious bloodstains of their father,　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　.</p>
<p>"Life Choir"! Work hard, strive, and progress!</p>
<h3>Ladies and Celebrities Perform Charity Show to Raise Disaster Relief Funds; "Dream of the Red Chamber" is Exquisite; Introduction to the Various Protagonists in the Play (Part Two)</h3>
<p>The protagonists of the charity performance for disaster relief, organized by the Women's War Relief Association, last night rehearsed the "Dream of the Red Chamber" scene of "Baochai Catching Butterflies." Miss Xin Muwen, one of the three outstanding tennis players from the Xin family, played Xue Baochai, with bright eyes and white teeth, dignified and elegant, and more than competent. During the rehearsal, she used her slender hands, holding a paper fan, suddenly chasing to the left, then to the right, then forward, then backward, as if there were live butterflies flying on the stage. Her posture was very lively, able to draw the audience's attention, and she is truly worthy of being a famous female athlete.</p>
<p>Continuing the performance of the scene "Shi Xiangyun Sleeping Drunken Among the Peonies," Miss Jian Ming, the younger sister of Hong Kong gentleman Mr. Jian Yingfu, played Shi Xiangyun, graceful and beautiful. She was graceful and charming. On that day, Baoyu invited her to a birthday wine, and Shi Xiangyun drank with particular enthusiasm, becoming very drunk, sleeping on the stone steps in the peony bushes, with peony flowers flying all around, her face and collar scattered with red fragrance. Miss Jian's performance, from being drunk to awakening, was a delightful and successful masterpiece.</p>
<p>In the scene "Twelve Hairpins Celebrating Birthday," the selection of actors for both the main and supporting hairpins was particularly strict. After four months of rehearsals, their artistic achievements were used to determine whether they were qualified to be selected. Among them, Miss Luo Qin Su, who played Zijuan, was petite, smart, lively, and particularly outstanding. It turns out that Miss Luo is the fifth daughter of Mr. Luo Renbo, the inspector of the Hong Kong Education Department. She is currently a graduate of the Italian Infant Hall. She is eager to learn and always wins first place in every examination. She has a deep understanding of music and dance.</p>

<p>— Huo Xi</p>
<p>Special: Understanding the New Script</p>
<p>Chinese Latinization is a phonetic script that uses Latin letters to spell Chinese; therefore, it is also called Latinized Chinese characters, or Latinization of Chinese characters, or Latinized New Script. Whether in theory or in practice, it has been proven that the new script is the most effective tool for eliminating illiteracy and popularizing education. For example, let’s take the sentence: "We are now going to study the new script." When written in the new script, it is: WOMN XIANZAI LAI IANGIU SIN MENZ. What a highly efficient method!</p>
<p>Based on the laws of script development, no matter which country's script, it has invariably evolved from the pictographic and ideographic stage to the phonetic stage; Chinese characters are no exception. Facts tell us that Chinese characters have long gradually departed from the pictographic and ideographic stage and entered the phonetic stage of pictophonetic characters and mutually explanatory characters.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Sun Ke, and more than seven hundred other people have expressed the following opinions on promoting the new script: "The most important task in the current stage of China is to popularize national self-salvation education. We must mobilize all tools to carry out this work. But when choosing tools, we must point out the great effectiveness of the new script. Script is a medium of communication. Chinese characters are like a wheelbarrow, Mandarin Romanization is like a steamboat, and the new script is like an airplane. When we take the new script's airplane to spread the education of national self-salvation, we will know that the new script not only does not hinder China's unification but also has the power to help awaken the masses and save our dying motherland." In addition, people such as Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, and Chen Heqin are also pioneers in promoting the new script. This is a well-known fact to those who are slightly concerned about the cultural movement because it is the dawn of China's new culture.</p>
<p>Doubt and Evolution</p>
<p>Since the new script has such value, why do some people still doubt it?</p>
<p>First, they feel that it is a pity to abandon the national essence—square characters—that have been passed down for thousands of years. In fact, from the point of view of the new script, it opposes both the stubborn assertion of those who regard Chinese characters as sacred and inviolable relics that should never be changed and the overly leftist assertion of abolishing Chinese characters.</p>
<p>We believe that script is just a tool, and its development follows the development of society, economy, and politics. Before the creation of phonetic Chinese characters, Chinese characters were also constantly developing and changing to meet the needs of a developing and progressing society. The Latinized Chinese script and every phonetic Chinese character scheme in the past ninety years are nothing more than a form in its continued development. Chinese characters themselves have their own historical value, and there is no need to abolish them, nor will they be abolished. Even in the future when Latinized Chinese characters become popular, Chinese characters will still be learned by people as the main tool for studying ancient Chinese academic thought.</p>
<p>Second, there is stubborn prejudice stemming from dislike and hatred—some people think that those who advocated the new script in the past held different political views from them, and they did not understand them. Therefore, they also became suspicious and denied the cultural tools used by the other party, just as woodcuts and anthems were not seen for what they really were.</p>
<p>The reason why the above two kinds of doubts occur is that people have not studied in detail what the new script actually is. Society is evolving, and "facts" will force the narrow-minded to be humble: those who do not understand the new script will gradually understand it.</p>
<p>A Precursor to Petitioning the Government to Promulgate and Promote the New Script</p>
<p>In the past eight years, there has been a surge of momentum across China for promoting the new script. In Guangdong alone, the Latinization of Cantonese and the Latinization of Chaozhou dialect have both shown a breakthrough attitude. After the "August 13th Incident," Dr. Chen Heqin, director of the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and a famous Chinese educator, achieved particularly remarkable results in promoting the new script in refugee shelters. Now, new script newspapers, publications, and mass reading materials in Shanghai are springing up like mushrooms after a rain.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Society has seen remarkable results in its experiments with the new script. At the National Education Conference in Chongqing, the following proposal was made:</p>
<p>"Our country's script is difficult and there are many illiterate people. In the past, various methods were used to promote literacy education, but it has been proven that it is not easy to achieve results in the shortest time. If this continues, illiteracy will not be eliminated and there will be no hope of raising the cultural level. It has been found that the Latinized New Script has been promoted domestically for many years and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, experiments in refugee shelters in Shanghai have yielded very satisfactory results. Refugees who were previously illiterate were able to read after studying for one month and were able to write after studying for two months. The speed of achieving results is far better than directly teaching Chinese characters. At this time of resisting the war and building the country, it is an urgent matter to eliminate illiteracy to enhance the strength of resistance and construction."</p>
<p>—The future of the new script is from now on revealing its dawn.</p>
<p>Dynamics of the New Script Movement in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Hong Kong New Script Society is an academic organization organized by well-known university professors and linguistic experts. After completing the registration procedures with the British government two months ago, its work has been carried out very actively. This newspaper's short commentary once gave it special praise.</p>
<p>Now, in order to step up the promotion of the new script and popularize education, the Society plans to hire two teachers first to teach in various places. However, since new script education is a pioneering undertaking in Hong Kong, it is necessary to study it first. Therefore, a new script teacher training class has been specially opened, enrolling 40 students for training. After the term expires, two qualified students will be selected first to serve as teachers, with a modest stipend of 20 yuan per month for each. The remaining outstanding students will also be hired if there is an opportunity. This is truly a new record for popular education in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The regulations for the New Script Training Class organized by the Hong Kong New Script Society are as follows: (1) Name: New Script Teacher Training Class. (2) Subjects: New Script and its theory, teaching methods, etc. (3) Location: Chi Chung School, 2nd Floor, No. 7, Du Lao Zhi Road, Wan Chai. (4) Time: Classes are held every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM. (5) Term: Six weeks. (6) Qualifications: Anyone who is interested in the new script, is willing to promote the new script movement, and can speak fluent Cantonese can enroll. Those with teaching experience and those who can speak Mandarin are also welcome. (7) Limit: This class will initially enroll 40 students, limited to those who register first. For those who exceed the quota but want to learn the new script, the Society also plans to set up classes for training in preparation for future teachers. (8) Tuition: Free; Textbook fees are paid by the students (approximately 1-2 jiao). (9) Registration: Hong Kong New Script Society Life Bookstore in the Amateur Association, 4th Floor, No. 23, Gan Nui Road, Wan Chai; Chi Chung School, Wan Chai. (10) Classes begin: Scheduled to start on Monday, May 22nd at 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>×Encirclement Resembles Trapped Beasts　Reinforcements Arrive for Intense Jiangmen Battles　×Planes Bomb Various Highways Frantically, Our Positions Undamaged　Tranquility in Zhongshan County, Artillery Fire Heard in the Fifth District Late at Night</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Express] Jiangmen is under siege by our army. Defending the city to the death, intense battles have been raging in various locations near the city for three days. Our frontline vanguards have repeatedly approached the suburbs, and the situation is extremely favorable. Guangzhou × chieftain reportedly learned that our siege of Jiangmen was very urgent. Yesterday (the 13th), it dispatched 18 planes that flew south to bomb our army's positions along the lines of Huicheng and the Xinhe-Jiang-Fo highways. We suffered no major damage. Several hundred × cavalry and seven or eight tanks also traveled from Rongqi, Guizhou, and Jiujiang to reinforce. Fierce battles occurred between our certain female security team and the enemies in the area west of A Xin Highway and Fuzi'ao. The sounds of gunfire and artillery continued throughout the day. At the same time, fierce battles also broke out in the Zhuangtangxia area of the Jiang-Fo Highway. A certain puppet army unit of several hundred people assisted the × in stubbornly resisting. Both sides are still fighting. The × have shown signs of fatigue and are not difficult to annihilate. Because Zhongshan is near the sea, it may be threatened by the ×. However, after County Magistrate Zhang and Commander Wu (Fei) arrived in Shiqi successively to deploy defenses, our strength has greatly increased. The military and civilians are on high alert. If the × invade, they will have to pay a heavy price. Currently, there are six × warships in the waters off Sanzao Island, moored between Dagang and Tanzhou. Around 2:00 AM late at night on the 13th, artillery fire echoed from the sea in the Fifth District, likely fired by × warships chasing fishing boats.</p>
<p>(Xijiang Express) In the Jianghui battles downstream of the Xijiang, our army has consistently taken the initiative. After successively capturing major strongholds such as Tangxia and Huicheng, they advanced towards Jiangmen and gradually annihilated the remaining × along the Jiang-Fo and Xinhe highways. The × army occupying Jiangmen is now in a state of encirclement on all sides, desperately seeking reinforcements from various sources. According to intelligence from military authorities, the × army in Jiangmen is continuing to reinforce, attempting to defend to the death. Yesterday, the 11th, over a dozen electric boats transported approximately 2,000 × reinforcements, along with over ten tanks and over 200 cavalry, via Jiujiang. In addition, Li Daoxuan and Liang Tianlu's 300-strong puppet self-defense force, combined with the original × puppet army, totaled approximately 9,000 troops.</p>
<p>(Zhongshan Express) Our counterattack on the Jiangmen front is proceeding smoothly. The × on the fourth section of the Jiang-Fo Highway have now completely collapsed and retreated to areas such as Tangxia, Xinmiao, and Yutang. There are no × traces left. Currently, the × have retreated to the line of Baitu-Shuanglong below, building defensive fortifications. On the 12th, over a hundred × soldiers traveled to Licun-Shuanglong, forcibly conscripting over two hundred civilians to build trenches and erecting a pillbox at the Licun bridgehead. The × in Zhoujun, Hengjiang, Huling, and Tianhe have also fled back to Ganzhu. Only a few dozen × soldiers remain on Zhutou Mountain opposite Jiujiang, erecting military telephone lines to transmit news from Jiangdou to Jiujiang. The × in Heqing still fire artillery at the opposite bank, targeting Gulaowei and Shitou Haikou. Currently, only about a hundred people are disguising four cannons on Dagang Mountain, aiming the muzzles at Gulao, Maicun, and Wangcun, putting on a show to intimidate. It's truly pathetic.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior Memorandum to Provincial Government: Eradicate Extravagant Burial Customs: Rather Than Burying Goods, Donate Them to the Nation</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express) The Ministry of Interior believes that during the period of resistance against Japan, everything should be based on frugality and thrift. Extravagant spending on civilian weddings and funerals has already been strictly prohibited. Recently, it has been observed that wealthy families still engage in extravagant and wasteful practices during funeral ceremonies. These bad habits should be eradicated. Yesterday, a memorandum was specially sent to the governments of all provinces, stating, "Investigations have revealed that funerals should be based on mourning and respect, without resorting to superstition and wastefulness. Frugality rather than extravagance is a clear ancient precept. Recently, it has been observed that wealthy families often bury the deceased with extravagant ornaments, burying useful goods underground. This is extremely unwise and can easily incite thieves to covet, desecrate graves, break coffins, and expose bones in the wild, which violates the sentiment of mourning and respect and loses the original intention. These bad habits should be strictly eradicated to reverse the declining trend and correct bad customs. Furthermore, at a time when the nation is facing a severe crisis and fighting a difficult war, the government is in need of funds. If the families of the deceased can transfer their burial ornaments and donate them to the nation, it would greatly benefit the future of the war effort. Local governments should widely encourage this and strive for practical results. In addition to distributing this memorandum, we are also sending a request to investigate and instruct your subordinates to earnestly prohibit and encourage these practices."</p>
<h3>Beihai Import and Export Goods: Additional Taxes Collected: Appropriated for War of Resistance Expenses</h3>
<p>(Beihai Correspondence) Beihai is an important stronghold for the War of Resistance in Southern Guangdong. National defense facilities should be prepared early. Funding for the local self-defense team's wartime preparations has also been planned separately, with donations allocated according to public debt proportions. Beihai accounts for 3,500 yuan. However, due to the frequent harassment by × planes and warships, very few people reside in Beihai, and they are unable to donate as allocated. It is proposed that 3/1000ths of the value of goods imported and exported by ships and boats in Beihai should be collected according to customs valuations, to raise 3,500 yuan in national currency for the self-defense team's wartime preparation expenses.</p>
<h3>Party, Government, and Military Join Forces to Form Fishing and Salt Inspection Team: Divided into Two Districts, Departing Soon</h3>
<p>(Shantou Correspondence) Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, coastal fishermen and salt producers have suffered greatly from the ravages of the ×. In order to quickly alleviate the disaster and find ways to improve the production of the fishing and salt industries and improve the lives of fishermen and salt producers, the Guangdong Party Bureau is organizing a fishing and salt inspection team. The team will consist of two or four representatives from the Fourth War Zone Commander's Office, the Provincial Party Department, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Department of Construction, the Provincial Relief Association, the Provincial Bank, and the Fisheries School. The team will conduct inspections along the coast in areas such as Chenghai, Shantou, Chaoyang, Huilai, Lufeng, Haifeng, and Huiyang, and organize and train fishermen and salt producers so that they can participate in anti-Japanese work at any time. The team has now arrived in Shantou. It is reported that the team will be divided into two districts, the Eastern Sea District and the Western Sea District. The leader of the Eastern Sea District is Liao Langru (representative of the Department of Construction), and the leader of the Western Sea District is Lin Jiemei (representative of the Department of Construction). They will depart for various locations soon to conduct inspections and report to the war zone and provincial government in order to improve the lives of fishermen and salt producers and promote wartime production.</p>
<h3>Leizhou Customs: Bans Export of Local Sugar: Merchants Request Reversal of Order</h3>
<p>(Mazhang Correspondence) The Leizhou Mazhang Customs General Administration recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that Southern Road local sugar contains 3/100ths of impurities, which seriously affects the credibility of foreign trade. Its export should be prohibited. Upon receiving the order, the Customs immediately implemented it. It is found that sugarcane sugar produced in the Leizhou Peninsula is transported and sold to Hong Kong and Macau every year in large quantities. Since the outbreak of the war in Jiangmen, sales have already decreased. Now that exports have been banned, the business of general sugarcane sugar merchants has plummeted, and they are all filled with sorrow. They have raised objections and, in accordance with the wishes of various merchants, the Dabao Chamber of Commerce in the county has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting a reversal of the order.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Issues Clear Regulations: Relief Measures for Housing in the Interior: Provincial Government Orders All County and City Governments to Implement Them Effectively</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express) Since the start of the War of Resistance, a large number of refugees from the war zone have flocked to the interior, making housing a serious problem. Recently, the Executive Yuan specially formulated relief measures for housing in the interior.

<h3>After Our Army Captured Fuhe: Zengcheng × Suffers Another Defeat: Attempt to Invade Lapu Thwarted by Our Heavy Assault</h3>
<p>(Wengyuan Express) In the battles of Zengcheng, our army is winning steadily. The × has suffered a setback. Because we captured Fuhe, we can approach Zhongxin to the west and attack Zhucun to the east, cutting off the Guangzhou-Zengcheng highway and the ×'s return route. Therefore, in addition to mobilizing heavy troops to reinforce Zhucun and strengthen defensive fortifications, they actually sent 400 infantry and over 100 cavalry yesterday (the 10th) to invade Lapu along the eastern section of the Zengcong Highway, attempting to intercept our army after the capture of Fuhe to relieve the crisis in Zengcheng. Our army's Liang Division immediately launched a head-on assault. The × cavalry repeatedly broke through our defenses, but we dealt with them calmly. The × could not succeed. Our army at Xitan, hearing the alarm, came out diagonally from the Longzeng Highway, crossed the Zengcong Highway, and flanked the × army. The × could not hold out and quickly fled along the original route towards the Kengkou area. Our army is continuing to advance towards Xiaolou.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Wartime Administration Guidelines: About to Be Implemented</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch) The Guangdong Wartime Administration Guidelines have recently been formulated and promulgated. Chairman Li believes that most of the various plans promulgated by the government in the past have not been realized. The reasons are due to a lack of determination and a failure to implement them effectively. The impossibility of the plan's content being implemented due to environmental needs, manpower, and financial resources is also a major reason. Great importance was attached to the formulation of these guidelines. First, senior officials from the provincial government and various departments, in accordance with the intentions of the Chairman and the Department Heads, drafted an initial draft based on Guangdong's environment and financial resources. Then, they repeatedly held meetings to discuss and draft the plan. Finally, Chairman Li invited Central Committee members陸幼剛 Deng Qingyang Xi and other committee members to discuss and revise the plan item by item. Then, it was submitted to the 18th Provincial Affairs Conference in early May for approval, promulgation, and implementation. The items listed are all those that are urgently needed in Guangdong's current wartime environment and can be implemented with manpower and financial resources. It is indeed a very complete set of administration guidelines. Now, according to its nature, the responsible authorities have gathered specialized personnel to formulate implementation measures. Among them, the more difficult tasks are to complete the Baojia system throughout the province and to prohibit opium and other drugs. It has now been decided to implement them. The remaining issues will also be quickly determined with implementation methods. If the Central Government grants authority and the people unanimously support it, it will definitely be successful on schedule. It is reported that the first meeting of the Senate to be held in the coming days will discuss this plan. However, the senators believe that it is already very complete. What will be discussed is how to mobilize the people of the province to promote the implementation of this plan.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of × Warships in Southern Guangdong: Carrier Off Weizhou Island: Moved to Haikou Four Days Ago</h3>
<p>(Beihai Express) Warships have been frequently sighted off the coast of Qinlian a month ago. The situation was severe. However, after our armies began to launch an offensive on Guangzhou, the ×, facing military pressure, transferred troops and ships to Guangzhou to reinforce. However, on the 3rd of this month, a × warship suddenly came to Beihai and cruised off the coast of Dianbai Liao, and then went elsewhere. Simultaneously, two × warships were also spotted on the Fangcheng side. One ship was moored off the coast of Jiangping, about 2,000 meters from the shore, and the remaining two ships were moored off the coast of Bailongwei, also about 2,000 meters from the shore. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, seven large and small × warships sailed from east to west off the coast of Haikang. Their whereabouts are unknown. Only one or two × warships are currently cruising in the Qiongzhou Strait. At 7:30 AM on the 5th of this month, a × warship moored off the coast of Sanniang Bay in Beihai sailed through the sea off Dianbai Liao and spotted a three-masted ship, which it immediately hijacked and sailed towards Yuandao. Artillery fire has been heard frequently from Qiongshan in recent days near Xuwen Gong. It is believed that the battles there are very intense. The × aircraft carrier previously moored off Weizhou Island sailed to Haikou four days ago. When the × aircraft carrier was moored near Tuanzhou, × planes flew daily over the counties of Southern Guangdong and the border areas of Guizhou and Yunnan, wreaking havoc. However, since the aircraft carrier sailed elsewhere, there have been no × planes taking off from the Weizhou area.</p>
<h3>General Cai Tingkai Sincere: Situation in Xijiang Stabilized</h3>
<p>(Shengqing Special Dispatch) The war in the Youjiang and Huijiang areas of the Western Front has been at a standstill for weeks. The 16th Army Group, responsible for the military affairs of the Southern Route of the West River and the left wing, has launched a major counterattack to the front line and left by way of mobile warfare and has recaptured important military strongholds such as the old Sanshui Makou Yangmei. The × army was greatly restrained. Vice Commander-in-Chief General Cai Tingkai inspected the Xijiang line to arrange counter-attack military affairs. He has now completed the inspection and returned to a certain location. According to his conversation, the frontline soldiers are all working hard. The troops along the line are strong and coordinated with the armed forces of the people. They are confident in both offense and defense. Regarding the counter-attack, General Cai said that of course, we have to counter-attack, but it is not a matter of one side or one front. The deployment is of course subject to the highest authorities. He continued that he had previously inspected the Southern Route and inspected the Xijiang ten times. The feelings were of course different, but in general, the anti-war sentiment in various places is rising day by day, the morale is rising day by day, and the future of the war is very optimistic. Cai also said that while the soldiers in the front are fighting hard, the people in the rear must do their best to provide spiritual and material assistance. Although the fall of Guangzhou has caused a big mistake, as long as we fight hard in the front and rear, we will be able to restore the glory of Guangdong. Cai attached great importance to overseas Chinese propaganda. He said that the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for resisting the war is commendable. During the Shanghai War, we received a lot of help from overseas Chinese, and their achievements are no less than those of the frontline soldiers. However, most of the overseas Chinese are Cantonese, and it is not difficult to imagine their feelings about the fall of Guangzhou without a fight. However, I hope that overseas Chinese will not be discouraged because of this. General Yu has previously sent Chen Mai and others to Nanyang and the Americas to raise aviation donations, and has raised more than 5 million yuan in donations. However, the number has never been announced since the fall of Guangzhou. Now overseas Chinese are very concerned about this, and I have also received many letters of inquiry, hoping that the authorities can announce the number as soon as possible, so as not to affect the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in resisting the war.</p>
<h3>Our Tax Police Regiment: Twice Raids into Meiyang</h3>
<p>(Xijiang Correspondence) In recent days, our army on the north bank of the Sanshui River in the Xijiang has frequently attacked the × in Yangmei Market on the Luxi Highway. On the 4th and 6th evenings, a certain unit of our tax police regiment raided Yangmei twice, annihilating many × and seizing many guns and documents. Therefore, the × in that area have been very alarmed in recent days and have repeatedly asked the × Command in Hekou for assistance. On the morning of the 9th, a unit of about 100 people from the × Takada unit moved from Zhennan Xinlu to Yangmei. After arriving, they invited all the gentry, civilians, and puppet maintenance committee members in the market to a meeting at the command, forced to participate were a total of seventy or eighty people. The × army said that the civilians who were attacked last time were suspected of colluding with the guerrillas and immediately arrested several puppet maintenance committee members and escorted them to the × Command in Southwest China for interrogation, forcing them to confess the base of our army and guerrillas," otherwise they would be charged with colluding with bandits. It is reported that several people are still being held in the southwest and have not been released. Their life and death are unknown.</p>
<p>Film and Drama</p>
<h3>Wartime Japanese Cinema</h3>
<p>— Xin Yi</p>
<p>Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, their film industry has gradually declined. The recent popularity of Japanese pornographic films can be said to reflect this slump, and it sufficiently proves the failure of their wartime cultural policies. Originally, the excessive control of people's thoughts and freedom only deepens their reactionary psychology. To use art to encourage the so-called "glorious war" and thereby anesthetize the people into joining what they consider a sacred fascist group, they must first restrain the people's minds, restricting them to the narrow scope of "praising the war." This may be greatly disadvantageous to the military warlords' aggressive actions, but the Japanese people, under heavy oppression, have long seen through the warlords' deceptive tactics and are no longer willing to be driven by them, like lambs obedient to the despicable hands of the military.</p>
<p>Film is a reflection of society and a promotion of culture. In modern countries, it has imperceptibly become a spiritual food needed by the masses. Since the Japanese people have exposed the military's numbing propaganda and various attempts at self-interest deception, they have consciously discarded films that praise the "Imperial Army's" great virtues and depict the various aspects of the "holy war" and have had to seek their spiritual nourishment elsewhere. In this situation, pornographic films have become a deformed development. Due to the uncontrollable rise of anti-war sentiment in the country, pornographic films that cater to base tastes are showing a lively trend. We speculate that the reason for the popularity of these pornographic films is none other than to vent the public's pent-up feelings of misery, ease their conflicting thoughts, and give the public a high degree of stimulation, so that they can temporarily forget the suffering they are enduring. The further the subject matter of the films is from reality, the more advantageous the military might think it is?</p>
<p>An old Japanese professor said: "Cannon fire has destroyed the ivory tower." Indeed, wartime Japanese cinema will never find cultural and artistic value.</p>
<p>The military has noticed this. Inevitably, worries arise. Thus, after Minister of Education Araki once hosted the film industry to explain the government's newly passed law prohibiting young people from watching love films, he recently banned films depicting gambling games. This is a bit confusing to us. We don't know if the so-called gambling games films refer to war films. If they know that gambling games are inappropriate, then is their invasion of China a desperate gamble?</p>
<p>Because of the promotion of war films, the various contradictory forms manifested by the Japanese film industry will become increasingly obvious. Japanese culture and art are also buried in the hands of the warlords. Just by looking at the hesitation of Japanese films under the guns, one can see a glimpse of the whole picture.</p>

<p>Feeling flustered. Going on stage was too early. Once on stage, looking at the scenery and the audience, he was so frightened that he became confused. He circled on stage, and the sound he made trembled like his legs. The audience found it amusing and booed, driving him off stage. Li Ona was so scared that he couldn't stand still. When he entered the backstage, he slammed into the scenery, even knocking off his hat. Caval asked him to go on stage again, but he refused to agree no matter what. The opera ended abruptly.</p>
<p>He returned to the dressing room and sat silently in front of the mirror. Suddenly, he saw Tao Si coming. Tao Si was also in the audience.</p>
<p>Tao Si rushed out and embraced him, exclaiming, "You poor child! Those audiences are so hateful! Don't pay attention to them, my love. You and I have sung songs, but in the end, you are not a singer, and I love you." Then, she couldn't help but chuckle, "I love you even more when I saw you bump into the tree on stage."</p>
<p>Li Ona also laughed, "It was an interesting thing."</p>
<p>Tao Si laughed loudly and said, "It was so funny that I almost gave my wife to a Li Po brother."</p>
<p>The phone rang. He picked up the phone and jokingly said, "I am a wandering poet."</p>
<p>"Stop messing around. I heard you messed up an opera. Is that true?" It was Mick's voice asking.</p>
<p>"Exactly. I messed it up," Li Ona said.</p>
<p>"Congratulations," Mick said, "because we have signed a contract for a building worth one million dollars in Marseille. We have to take the train to Miami in twenty minutes——"</p>
<p>Before Li Ona finished the phone call, he had already put on his coat, not even bothering to take off his costume. Tao Si took off his fake beard and threw it against the wall, then called for a car.</p>
<p>"My love," Li Ona exclaimed, kissing her and smearing the oil paint from his face onto her cheek. He embraced her, carried her out the door, and said, "We won't do this singing thing anymore. If we sing again, I will definitely shoot us both dead!"</p>
<p>"Okay!" Tao Si replied resolutely. (The End)</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Baseball Games: South China and Youpi Both Triumph Two Games Took Four Hours and Fifteen Minutes Min Dian Nu and Western Society Both Suffered Defeats</h3>
<p>Yesterday, two games were held in the Hong Kong Open Baseball League: (1) Min Dian Nu vs. Youpi, (2) Western Society vs. South China Society. Chinese and Western spectators were very crowded, and the shouts of encouragement echoed throughout the field, making it quite lively. The two games took a total of four hours and fifteen minutes (from 10:15 AM to 2:30 PM), which was exhausting for both the players and the recorders.</p>
<p>In the first battle, the foreign sailors fought against Youpi. Many expected the foreign sailors to have a strong chance of winning, but the result was the opposite. The American naval heroes, such as the giant Degilith and pitcher Lu Ailu, both performed abnormally. Therefore, in the third inning, they changed their formation, with Degilith stepping down and being replaced by Todd at first base. With this change, the situation worsened, and they were repeatedly run back to home base by Beishi, Susha, Bashi, and Li Anna, scoring four points. Although Min Dian Nu scored a home run by Tamas during the attack, sending Tali back to the base, they only scored two points, half as many as Youpi. In the fifth inning, Min Dian had no points, but Youpi's Xi Gao Li sent out a fly ball during the hit. Wei Luson did not handle it properly and missed the catch, allowing Xia Gao Li to return to home base in one breath, also scoring a home run. In the sixth inning, Min Dian Nu again failed to score. When it was Youpi's turn to attack, Susha, Ya Bashi, and Di Li Anna successively got on base, forming a "full base" advantage. When Xia Gao Li got a "triple," they all returned to base in succession, scoring three points. Xia Gao Li stole back to home base while Li Anna was hitting the ball. In this inning, Youpi scored a total of four points. In the seventh inning, Min Dian Nu's Tali hit a ground ball and sprinted to first base. Li Anna was overly anxious and threw the baseball. Li Anna at first base failed to catch it, so Tali got to first base. When Tamas hit, he also got a home run, so Tali and Tamas each scored one point. In total, Min Dian Nu scored four and Youpi scored nine. The Min team lost.</p>

<p>In the second battle, the Western team attacked first, but failed three times. When South China attacked, Wu Zhenbang and Tang Rongguang each scored one point, with great momentum. In the second inning, the Western team was at a loss and again ended with zero points. South China's Liang Zhuoquan first got a free base. Feng Jingxiang hit the ball skillfully and sent a long ball, running to second base. When Situ Bi hit the ball, the Western pitcher missed the catch, so Liang Zhuoquan returned to base, and Ge Xiang and Situ Bi each advanced to first base. Li Zhongshi hit a short ball, and Jingxiang sprinted to the base and succeeded, scoring one point. The Western pitcher and catcher failed to kill Jingxiang, but Li Zhongzhen successfully reached first base. Li intended to sacrifice, but was lucky to reach base safely. Then, Wu Zhenbang went up. The high ball was caught, and Rongguang struck out three times in a row. Zhu Guolun got a hit, and Situ Bi and Li Zhongzhen took the opportunity to return to base and scored one point. Bao Jiaping hit a high ball that landed near first base. Biludo missed the catch, and Jia Ping safely reached first base. Guolun stole to second base. Yu Tian got a free base, and Zhu Guolun returned to base. Bao Jiaping stole second base. Liang Zhuoquan returned to the field, taking advantage of the pitcher's "four balls" to advance to first base. When Liang was blocked, the overall situation collapsed. Later, the Western team scored three points in the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings, totaling five points, which was no match for the South China team, which scored seven points in total.</p>

<h3>Dai Cup Tennis Match: New Zealand Ultimately Loses to England Southern Hungary Wins a Singles Match First</h3>
<p>[Hainan Society, London, 14th dispatch] After England won two singles matches yesterday, it entered the second week with three wins and two losses against New Zealand. In the first match, Shahqi (England) defeated Blair (New Zealand) in three straight sets with 6-3, 6-4, and 7-5. In the second match, Hall (England) also defeated Erfalai (New Zealand) with 3-0, with scores of 7-5, 6-4, and 6-4.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 14th dispatch] Yesterday's Dai Cup Southern vs. Hungarian singles match was delayed due to heavy rain. In the first match, Song Te'ao (Southern) narrowly defeated Gabo (Hungary) with 6-3, 0-6, 2-6, 6-1, and 6-1. The reason for Gabo's defeat was that he went all out in the first three sets and was exhausted afterward, suffering a miserable defeat. In the second match, Hungary's Boshi led with 7-5, 4-6, and 6-5, but the match was postponed due to darkness. The South team led 1-0.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Basketball Games: Three Division B Games Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's public men's basketball games at the Youth Gym included three Division B games. However, in the Qing team vs. Huaqiao team game, the Qing team did not appear, and the referee declared that the Qing team had forfeited, making the Huaqiao team the winner. In the first game, the police faced Pei Ying. The police were not a strong team, but their fighting power was exceptionally fierce, and they were physically strong. Pei Ying was a strong team in this competition. Since the start of the competition, they have been invincible. When the two teams clashed, Pei Ying passed the ball well, and Guan Zhenbin, Chen Xiyang, and Huang Yaohua took advantage of the situation to launch surprise attacks. On the police side, Shalifu Qin Shagen, He Shouyi, Chen Guoliang, and others all made contributions. However, Pei Ying made more progress and ultimately defeated the police with 33 to 25. In the final game, Guan Dian fought Taikoo. Guan Dian was united and coordinated well. Wang Tongfu, Yu Jiaoyuan, and Yu Jinbang were all able to hit the target accurately. Taikoo's Zeng Qiliang, Zhu Fuxian, Li Guocai, Feng Ziqiang, and Guo Ying tried their best to counterattack, but the front line did not take active enough steps. Taikoo ultimately lost with 49 to 57. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3>Building a Common Front of Sports Friendship (1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Suixian</p>
<p>Since the "May Fourth" Movement, the purpose of education has been to emphasize morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. At that time, it was deeply felt that the "emphasizing literature and neglecting martial arts" of the past imperial examination era had lost its value. Therefore, the "May Fourth" slogan loudly called for "eliminating emphasizing literature and neglecting martial arts"—this is a glorious expression of the sports promoted by the "May Fourth Movement"—but this glorious expression—has reached twenty years. The original educational purpose has been manipulated and manipulated, but there is no way to balance it—as for mass sports, it is even more out of the question.</p>
<p>In fact, sports and politics have a cause-and-effect relationship, and they have a closer relationship with the nature of society. In the past, Chinese athletes did not have a deep understanding of this point, or they had an understanding but did not implement it effectively, so the sports cause could not develop. It is not a phenomenon of miscarriage, it can be said that it has not conceived.</p>
<p>This article is to build a common front of sports friendship. As usual, with many unfamiliar sports comrades, you always have to come up with a set of cold-style polite words first, but I have not learned this set of polite words, please forgive me, sports friends. In fact, politeness is not good at all, it only helps to promote hypocrisy. We can only encourage the struggle for the real sports cause. Although we don't know each other when we meet on the street, when I write this article, I treat every reader who reads this article as my close friend, because I want to write out my enthusiasm and ideals, and tell my wishes for sports. I firmly believe that friendship built on a correct and common understanding is worthy of being promoted.</p>
<p>The so-called sports in our country in the past were only nominally carried out in schools. Recently, the military and police schools seem to be more active, but the sports of farmers, workers, and merchants have never been mentioned. However, the sports of schools and the sports of the military and police are completely inconsistent with the essence of sports because they do not grasp the truth of sports, because sports training in general schools emphasizes "championship" and "athlete system." Every time they win a championship or sports meeting, it seems that the sports have succeeded. After these athletes who win championships are vigorously promoted in the society, they can become an important administrative staff or coach of sports. Although there are many advanced sports comrades who strongly advocate universal sports training and implement the slogan of eliminating championship and athlete system, it is only a temporary passion. Because of the lack of publicity of "sports truth," as well as the lack of concrete actions and firm will, they are surrounded by the inherent forces of the athletes, and they have to beat their own mouths. As for military and police sports, they also value the championship principle. A well-known athlete can join the ranks of the military and police to fill a dignified military officer. This dignified military officer is not used to serve as a regular sports coach. The purpose is to win long-term championships - this is an obvious fact that no one can deny.</p>
<p>Therefore, the sports meetings held in various counties, provinces, and even the national sports meetings are all places for creating athletes. Only those well-known student athletes and military officers who are used to compete for championships gather to show off their skills. In the sports field, those idol-worshipping audiences cheer loudly, using entrance tickets worth a few cents or a few yuan, just to encourage them to compete for championships. They are of no benefit to themselves, but the entrance tickets are at least a few cents, so only the property class can enjoy it. The poor people outside the venue who can only hear applause, and the newspaper reporters who can be visited when the audience comes out of the venue, such sports meetings are called "promoting sports"—</p>
<p>However, according to the general practice of sports meetings, the four sides of the venue are inevitably pasted with glorious colorful slogans, "Implement universal sports—", "Implement sports to save the country—", "Implement national sports" and so on. But I have never seen slogans such as "Eliminate championship—", "Promote sports for farmers and workers", "Eliminate sports for gentry and merchants", "Eliminate the athlete system", etc. This kind of sports meeting that promotes sports has been going on for more than 20 years. If we are going to popularize mass sports in this way, it will be useless to extend it for decades or even hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the national liberation war, they still do not recognize the turning point of this great era, so the work of sports has not been coordinated with the war of resistance. We know the culture in the war of resistance. Is there any department that does not participate in this sacred national liberation struggle? National defense mass literature penetrates the countryside, national roar singing penetrates the countryside, and mass cartoons and woodcuts also penetrate the countryside...... Only the sports that have claimed to save the country for more than 20 years have not been able to come up with any facts. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Philippine Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Dongtang</p>
<p>Gan Wei suggested a dice game, saying that if I won, I should treat everyone. Afternoon</p>
<p>May 6th Market Mangoes</p>
<p>I woke up early and pushed the window open. Rain followed the wind. The distant mountains were shrouded in mist and rain, a natural painting. After breakfast, I braved the rain to leave Baguio and returned to Manila in the afternoon. The luggage had already been transported to the "Taiping" ship, preparing to return to Hong Kong early tomorrow morning. At five o'clock, we went to the market together to scramble to choose gifts for relatives and friends. The king of Little Luzon, visitors to this place, do not forget this special product. In the evening before returning to Hong Kong, my friends held a farewell banquet for me. After the meal, I took Yao Yishi, Mao Anxi, Mai Qijing, Bi Ziyou, and others to a late-night gambling session. I won many tickets, and Yishi lost even more. I went to the market today.</p>
<p>I vaguely heard the sound of calling out for pheasant, but the season was about to pass, and there were not many fine products. Strong and luxurious ones were as rare as morning stars. I had no choice but to settle for second best. After dinner, my teammates parted ways and went their separate ways, some watching movies and some going to dance halls to pass the long night. Although I boarded the ship late, I inspected each room, and nine out of ten rooms were empty. I think my friends are still immersed in the nightlife, and they are happy to return to the fields.</p>
<p>May 7th, 8th, 9th Return Voyage</p>
<p>At dawn on the 7th, the "Taiping" ship sailed north. Only a few close friends came to see me off. After lingering for ten days, I set off on my return journey again. This time, parting is difficult to predict when we will meet again. God intentionally played tricks on people. "When coming, there were waves, but when returning, there were no waves." The voyage lasted two days and nights. The weather was beautiful, and the water was calm. Those who feared the sea put their hands on their foreheads and were deeply grateful. On the ship, I was again taken care of by the enthusiastic Hua Manager Lin Chengjun. The food and drink were excellent, and there was nothing lacking. All day long, we gathered and sat in the smoking room, playing leaf cards, with drinking as the prize. The 46-hour voyage life was spent in sleep and laughter. On the morning of the 9th, I saw Hong Kong again. A tired bird returning home was still safe and sound. I saw friends gathered on the Jianggan shore to welcome me, about one hundred people. Before the ship docked, we recognized each other, competing for the strongest eyesight. When we left the ship, the teammates said goodbye one after another, looking forward to meeting again in the future. What I have said above is based solely on my personal memories. My writing skills are limited, and I don't care about the skill of the work. After tea and wine, I talk casually, with no other intention. (The End)</p>
<h3>After Lu Zhenxuan Published an Article Expressing His Views, It Aroused Resentment in the Basketball Community, and a Formal Letter Will Be Sent to the Federation Requesting Sanctions</h3>
<p>On the 13th of this month, a certain newspaper published Lu Zhenxuan's "Impressions" of basketball games in "Hong Kong". The wording in the article was insulting to the Hong Kong basketball community, which aroused resentment. The Hong Kong basketball community was extremely dissatisfied with this matter, so yesterday at 1:00 PM, a meeting was held at the Si Hao Hotel, second floor. Representatives from various basketball teams attended. The chairman announced the reason for the meeting, and then began to discuss the incident of Lu Zhenxuan insulting the basketball community. Various parties expressed their opinions, all believing that Lu's actions were indeed an insult to the entire Hong Kong basketball community. It was immediately proposed: (1) Whether to take unified action to deal with Lu Zhenxuan's article, and it was resolved to take unified action; (2) To jointly send a letter requesting the Basketball Committee to impose sanctions to rectify discipline, which was passed; (3) Two committee members were publicly elected to draft the letter to the Federation. The meeting adjourned after 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3>After the Recovery and Prosperity of Shanghai's Trade, the Import Surplus is Alarming, with Japanese Goods Accounting for the Largest Share</h3>
<p>Shanghai, due to its superior location and convenient transportation, has seen its industry flourish daily, becoming the trade center and economic hub of the country, and the only major port in the Far East. After the war, the center of finance and trade shifted inward, causing a period of decline, but it has now gradually recovered. However, the import surplus has increased significantly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Since the first year of the Republic of China, the total value of import and export trade has increased from 30 million yuan to over 100 million yuan, accounting for more than 50% of the total national trade. Before the eighth year of the Republic of China, imports generally accounted for 12% to 18% of the national total. From the ninth to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, this increased to over 20%. Since then, it has increased year by year, with the highest rate being 58.96% in the twenty-fifth year. From the first to the eighth year of the Republic of China, exports generally accounted for over 40%, but then decreased to around 30%. However, after the twenty-second year, it increased again to 50%.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, imports were 51,081,100 yuan, accounting for 53.42%, and exports were 40,467,200 yuan, accounting for 48.25%. If the August 13th Incident had not occurred, the import and export trade would have increased by another quarter, possibly setting a new record since the first year of the Republic of China. After the war, due to the inward shift of the financial and trade center, there was a period of decline, but it soon gradually recovered. For example, in the twenty-seventh year, imports were 27,489,600 yuan, accounting for 30.77%, and exports were 22,303,900 yuan, accounting for 29.20%.</p>
<p>Since the third quarter of last year, Shanghai's trade has gradually recovered. In the first quarter of this year, imports were 12,890,900 yuan, accounting for 46.97%, and exports were 8,133,000 yuan, accounting for 41.80%. Compared with the same quarter of last year, imports were 5,280,900 yuan, accounting for 22.95%, and exports were 3,369,800 yuan, accounting for 25.10%. The increase in import and export trade was 12,373,700 yuan, which proves that Shanghai's trade is gradually recovering.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city in an occupied area, and the Jianghai Customs is under duress, having changed its flag to the "Five-Colored Flag". Tax revenue is now deposited in Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank, and the number of Japanese customs officers has increased. As a result, many orders from the Chinese government cannot be implemented by the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai. The plan to eliminate the import surplus cannot be realized by the Shanghai Customs. Although trade is gradually recovering, the import surplus continues to increase. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the import surplus was 47,578,000 yuan, an increase of 28,471,000 yuan compared to the 19,100,700 yuan in the same quarter of last year. This is something that all people in Shanghai should be ashamed of.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Customs that since May of last year, the import of Japanese goods has ranked first in the trade of various countries with China. In the first quarter of this year, it was 71,386,000 yuan, an increase of 23,375,000 yuan compared to the second-ranked 48,013,000 yuan. The import of Japanese goods, except for the customs in North China, is mainly through the Shanghai Customs, rather than the occupied areas in the southwest. These Japanese goods are being dumped into the occupied areas. The important reason for this is that the Shanghai Customs has been seized, the tax rate has been arbitrarily modified, and Japanese goods are given various conveniences for import.</p>
<p>As Shanghai's trade gradually recovers, the number of foreign merchant ships coming and going has also increased, ranking first among all customs in the country. For example, in January of this year, imports and exports were 280 ships, 1,181,478 tons; in February, imports and exports were 260 ships, 1,189,993 tons; in March, imports and exports were 290 ships, 1,263,901 tons. In the first quarter of this year, there were a total of 835 ships, 3,635,372 tons. However, the ships coming and going are mostly Japanese merchant ships. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the number of Japanese merchant ships was 1,545, 2,526,287 tons, ranking first among all countries.</p>
<h3>It is Not Easy to Live in Shanghai; Food Prices are Soaring</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident in Shanghai, people's lives have seen a sharp increase in expenses. In addition to the sudden increase in housing and population, resulting in soaring rents, household goods have also continued to rise in price. Daily necessities such as rice, vegetables, and the "seven necessities of life: firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea" have all increased in price. For example, meat such as fresh pork and ham costs one yuan per pound; for middle ribs, one yuan can only buy four taels per catty; live chickens cost one yuan for one catty and two or three taels; fresh fish also costs three or four mao to eight or nine mao per catty. Even vegetarian foods that common people consider the cheapest, such as "bean sprouts and salted tofu", have seen prices soar due to the Japanese manipulation of raw materials such as soybeans and sesame oil. At the beginning of this spring, one yuan could buy five catties and seven or eight taels of sesame oil, but now it can only buy less than three catties. Therefore, even the cheapest foods are no longer inexpensive. The recent price increases for food are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Prices at Tofu Shops [Unit: Mao]</p>
<p>Tofu skin per catty: 2.60; Old tofu, small block: 8.00</p>
<p>Tofu skin per sheet: 20 wen; Large block per block: 10.0</p>
<p>Thick fried dough sticks per catty: 3.00; Per piece: 100 wen</p>
<p>Thin fried dough sticks per catty: 3.50; Tender tofu per block: 5.00</p>
<p>Minimum sale: 0.30; Per piece: 20 wen</p>
<p>Fragrant dried tofu per piece: 0.10; Triangular fried tofu: 20 wen</p>
<p>Stinky dried tofu per piece: 0.10; Small piece: 15 wen</p>
<p>Tofu skin sheet: 0.60; Square fried tofu block: 10 wen</p>
<p>(2) Prices at Flour Shops [Unit: Wen]</p>
<p>Flour per catty: 380; Sliced noodles per catty: 300</p>
<p>Real flour: 640; Noodle skin per catty: 300</p>
<p>Small flour: 480; Flour skin per sheet: 20</p>
<p>Water thread flour: 140; Tofu per block: 40</p>
<p>(3) Most Common Vegetarian Dishes at Vegetable Markets [Unit: Mao]</p>
<p>Chicken feather vegetables per catty: 0.90; Yellow bean sprouts per catty: 0.80</p>
<p>Radish tops per catty: 0.80; Green bean sprouts per catty: 0.70</p>
<p>Tender goods: 1.20; Sprouted bean sprouts per catty: 0.80</p>
<p>Celery per bunch: 0.60; Pickled mustard greens per catty: 1.20</p>
<p>Small bundle: 0.50; Minimum sale: 0.20</p>
<p>Chives per catty: 1.40; Fresh bamboo shoots per catty: 3.20</p>
<p>Mustard greens: 0.60 to 1.50</p>
<p>Chinese cabbage per catty: 1.00; Tender spinach per catty: 2.00</p>
<p>Fresh broad beans: 1.00 to 1.50</p>
<p>To 0.80; Mugwort per catty: 0.90</p>
<p>Broad chard: 0.80; "X" vegetables per catty: 3.00</p>
<p>The prices of the above vegetarian dishes have generally increased by two-thirds compared to before the war, and some have even doubled. For example, tofu used to cost 10 wen per block, but now it costs 20 wen; dried tofu used to cost 15 wen per block, but now it costs 30 wen; pickled vegetables and bean sprouts used to cost a minimum of 40 or 50 wen, but now they cost a minimum of four or five fen in foreign currency. The hardship of the masses is all thanks to the invaders.</p>
<h3>This Year's Shanghai Silk Reeling Industry</h3>
<p>The most pressing and important problem facing the Shanghai silk reeling industry is raw materials. Shanghai silk factories consume more than 150,000 dan of dried cocoons annually, according to current conditions. This year, the so-called Central China Company actually wants to ban the transport of cocoons to Shanghai, control cocoon businesses in various rural areas, and attempt to monopolize the industry. Shanghai factories are deeply concerned about this. Recently, the situation has eased slightly. Except for the towns, cocoon businesses in the surrounding rural areas are mostly controlled by guerrilla forces. If "Central China" officially goes to the countryside to purchase cocoons, it will inevitably be attacked by the guerrillas. Therefore, after deliberation by the Japanese puppet regime of "Central China", it was decided to temporarily abandon cocoon businesses outside its sphere of influence and have Chinese agents purchase cocoons in the countryside in their names, transport them to the city, and then resell them to "Central China." On the one hand, it publicly declared that Chinese cocoon merchants were allowed to freely set up businesses to purchase cocoons without hindrance. As a result, other cocoon merchants saw a great opportunity. However, it is rumored that the cocoons purchased must be divided equally with "Central China," with some saying they can be transported to Shanghai, while others say it is absolutely impossible. There are also many rumors.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 37 silk factories in Shanghai. If there are no real raw materials transported to Shanghai, they will inevitably be forced to suspend operations. Each factory is concerned about this, so they openly gather to discuss the issue. At this time, it is impossible to give a definite answer. If it is decided to first start renting businesses in the guerrilla area, it depends on the policy of the agents. Cocoon business owners in the countryside who understand the greater good are unwilling to be used by "Central China," so they mostly refuse to cooperate and flock to Shanghai to sign lease contracts with various factories. Both parties cooperate closely. Due to environmental reasons, there are concerns about various obstacles, so the business owners are fully responsible for all liabilities. The general contract prices on the market are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) The business owner is responsible for all military taxes, levies, shipping costs, staff salaries, and meals from the time of self-collection to the loading on the river steamer. The contract price per dan of dried cocoons is approximately 35 yuan to over 40 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The business owner is only responsible for the cost of producing dried cocoons and drying labor. The factory is responsible for police expenses, meals, and other issues. The contract price per dan is approximately 20 yuan to over 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, merchants favor businesses in Guangyin because they are close to the Yangtze River and shipping is more convenient. Therefore, the rise and fall of contract prices depend on the current environment and are approximately three to four times higher than before the war.</p>
<p>In Yixing, due to the fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops, there is no certainty about the future of cocoon purchases, and the danger is greater than in other places. (Xiang)</p>

<h3>"Unite Sincerely to Resist Aggression to the End"</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>I remember very clearly that on the evening of March 27th last year, I received an express letter from Lao Xiang from Hankou, saying that the National Literary and Art Association would hold its founding conference on April 1st. He wanted me to come and attend no matter what. At that time, my excitement was truly beyond words. I felt that the literary workers who were usually ridiculed as "writers despising each other" and who had had so-called "Shanghai School" and "Beijing School" in the past could now put aside all personal prejudices and unite under the banner of resistance against aggression and national construction, taking the interests of the country and the nation as the premise. This matter was really too great and too gratifying! At that time, because I was entrusted by Madam Feng Li Dequan to raise money for the wartime children's protection society in Changsha, and the matter had not ended, I could not attend the founding conference, but my full enthusiasm and expectations for the conference were conveyed by the telegram "Unite sincerely to resist aggression to the end."</p>
<p>The circumstances of receiving the letter and sending the telegram are still vivid in my mind, but the relentless time has slipped away for another year.</p>
<p>In this year, I personally feel very ashamed. I have not made any contribution to the Literary Association. Because of my frequent illnesses and the fact that my residence is too far from the association, I often miss meetings. The Literary Association should bear considerable responsibility in this great era, but the work is not yet sufficient and is far from what everyone desires. In the future, I hope that every comrade of the Literary Association will concentrate their efforts to help the Literary Association develop the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Expand the organization and strengthen the organization.</p>
<p>2. Connect the feelings of members and intensify the work of members.</p>
<p>3. Improve the leadership organs, establish branch associations in the front and rear, and establish the closest contact with the general association.</p>
<p>4. Establish a literary library so that members or non-members can borrow books freely.</p>
<p>5. Establish a youth creative guidance committee to provide opportunities for many young friends who aspire to engage in literary creation.</p>
<p>6. Establish a literary worker's inquiry office to be responsible for introducing new books and magazines, and the correspondence addresses of literary friends, etc.</p>
<p>7. Plan to print soldiers' reading materials and mass reading materials.</p>
<p>8. Organize front-line service groups or rear-area inspection groups to go deep into the ranks and the public to carry out propaganda. The above are a few points that I thought of in a hurry as suggestions for this conference. I hope that my dear comrades will continue to adhere to the spirit of uniting sincerely and resisting aggression to the end, and work harder for the national country!</p>
<h3>On the Recitation of Poetry and Recitational Poetry</h3>
<p>— Chang Renxia</p>
<p>The recitational poetry movement, which arose with the songs of national salvation, has gradually attracted attention. Although recitational poetry has not yet shown much power among the masses, this movement, if it can continue to develop well, will surely achieve the results it deserves in the future. This is predictable. In order to develop this movement, to make it grow, develop, and even become healthy, we should arouse the support of the broad literary and art circles, and actually try, explore, and improve it, in order to become something that the masses are happy to accept.</p>
<p>Regarding the recitation of poetry, some people think that the musical component should be emphasized. However, based on the results of my personal experiments in several recitation meetings in Hankou and Guilin, it is better to say that recitational poetry focuses on the dramatic aspect rather than the musical aspect. There is a distinction between "recitation" and "singing." To "sing" poetry is to musicalize it, that is, to make it neat and rhythmic, and often to use instruments to accompany it. To perform the poem using the "singing" method. But "recitation" is another method. It does not need to have rhyme. In repeated experiments, it is unrhymed prose poetry that is easier to recite. What is necessary for recitation is the sonority of the tone and the clarity of the pronunciation. In order to convey the imagery in this poem, the reciter can add high and low accents to each sentence or word. Sadness, solemnity, joy, anger, hatred, longing, hope, fear, etc. must all be expressed in the voice. At the same time, one should use acting skills. Do not forget the posture of your body, the movements of your hands, and the expressions on your face. These must be integrated with the poem you are reciting. The valuable techniques you have gained on the stage are also best used when reciting poetry.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a world-renowned recitational poet from Denmark came to China and gave a large recitation in Nanjing. I went to see it. His recitation of La Fontaine's fables and many famous European poems was just like a stage performance. Perhaps many people have seen the famous films "Romeo and Juliet" and "As You Like It"? These are adaptations of Shakespeare's poetic dramas. In "Romeo and Juliet," the famous actor John Barrymore's long recitation as he walked down the stairs was excellent, with his hands and eyes working together. In "As You Like It," the leading actress, also a famous European actress, participated in the production, and the two monologues at the beginning and end were also two great recitations of poetry, beautiful and moving, which can serve as models for our recitation of poetry. Recitation leans towards the dramatic aspect and not towards the musical aspect. Recitation has its own unique points. If recitation is the same as singing, then how is it different from songs of national salvation? If you think that "any poem can be recited, so why is there only recitational poetry?" then you are not entirely correct. Take ancient Chinese poetry as an example. In regulated verse and quatrains, the focus is on the coordination of level tones and oblique tones and rhyme, which emphasizes the musical component and makes it suitable for singing. As for ancient-style poetry in five-character and seven-character lines, Du Fu often had lines with five level tones or five oblique tones, and used oblique rhymes, which was to try to break away from music and make it unsuitable for singing. By the time of Song poetry, it was common to use the method of ending with three level tones, which was also to increase the sonority of the tone when reciting. The popular drum songs in general society often have different ways of singing and speaking. The so-called speaking in drum songs is also recitation. Recitation does not need music, but it can also be accompanied by music, the purpose of which is only to help the reciter to emphasize the atmosphere, just like the music accompanying movies, which is different from the accompaniment of singing poetry.</p>
<p>Regarding the poetry for recitation, it is generally believed that it should be popular, mass-oriented, and colloquial. This is of course true, but what should be avoided is the use of slogans. In addition, the emptiness and abstraction of the content also become fatal flaws of recitational poetry. Poetry has its artistic techniques, and even recitational poetry is no exception. If the content is not moving, even if it is popularized, mass-oriented, and colloquial, it still cannot be welcomed by the masses. The so-called popularization, mass-orientation, and colloquialization are only conditions that enable everyone to understand, but to arouse the interest of the masses, it is not enough to only fulfill these conditions. In the current anti-Japanese war, it is easy for poets who serve the masses to achieve popularization and colloquialization, but on the one hand, those schools of poetry such as imagism, aestheticism, or the demonic school are rapidly decreasing, and on the other hand, poetry of slogans and catchphrases has suddenly become rampant and popular. Slogans and catchphrases are definitely not poetry. To string them together into poetry is to court death. The masses still need a lot of explanation for the meaning of a slogan. If you recite a string of slogans and catchphrases, the masses will look blank. We must make the external form of recitational poetry popular, and the emotions in the content even richer, and the narration even more concrete. The best poems for recitation are narrative poems. The ancients said that even old women could understand the poems of Bai Juyi, which also refers to his narrative poems. The works of Homer, the ancient bard, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, which have been handed down to this day, are all epic poems. The storytellers circulating in our villages also tell stories of heroes and upright officials. In the current struggle for national liberation, there are many heroic historical facts that can be used as themes for recitational poetry to arouse the anti-imperialist and anti-fascist enthusiasm of the whole people and jointly embark on the camp of resistance.</p>
<p>Lyric poems are not suitable for recitation. Small lyrics can only be recited in a low voice. Some are simply only suitable for reading and conveying emotions through vision. The so-called sensory school of poetry is this kind. Don't recite what cannot be recited. Even if it is recited, the masses will not have the leisure to enjoy it. We must study the customs, habits, living conditions, and underlying suffering of the masses in order to serve the masses, and use these as the scope of our creation. The upright officials and heroes that the storytellers of the past talked about relieved the suffering of the people and helped the poor and needy. This was precisely a kind of dream of the people under the oppression of feudal forces, so it was welcomed by the broad masses. Stories like the Sword Pavilion Song and Daiyu's Autumn Sadness are just diversions for the leisure class after they are full. The masses do not have this kind of sentimental interest. Literary and art workers who are engaged in the task of resistance cannot recite things that are unrelated to the anti-Japanese war.</p>
<p>Recitational poetry is a new movement. We should hold more recitational meetings. Only through practices can we discover our mistakes and stabilize our foundation. First conduct small-scale experiments, and then go to the streets, go to the countryside, go to the factories, go to the troops, go to all kinds of different mass groups. This is how the positive effect of recitational poetry is brought into play.</p>
<p>In order to support this movement, we hope to conduct continuous exploration and continuous experimentation on the creation of "recitational poetry" and the methods of "the recitation of poetry." (End)</p>
<h3>Current Cartoons</h3>
<p>— He Chengjiang</p>
<p>Painting is a branch of noble art. Art for national defense, art for the war of resistance. Therefore, drawings should also coordinate with the war of resistance to create propaganda. However, painters are, after all, artists, lofty scholars in ivory towers. Therefore, some painters cover their ears and close their eyes, entrusting their emotions to high mountains and flowing water, flowers, and birds. However, we cannot ignore a group of young cartoonists who are using art, valuing reality, and observing reality. They express all contradictions, all darkness, and all injustices through the coating of art, using light and color, and background to give full play to their mission to resist the war.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, I personally have visited two exhibitions of cartoons about the War of Resistance. The first time was at the Guangzhou Changdi Youth Association last spring. The second time was this Chinese Cartoon Exhibition at the Central Theater!</p>
<p>In this Chinese Cartoon Exhibition, there are dozens of cartoons, all the works of famous artists, fully expressing the greatness, sacredness, and bravery of the War of Resistance. It should be meaningful to promote the War of Resistance and to create art for national defense! Ding Tingjun's "Mom" shows the tragic fate encountered by children. The picture shows a child crying at his mother who was crushed to death in a bombed house. This is a very profound work, with excellent light and color. Mr. Ye Qianyu's "Peace Bait" fully shows us not to fall for the enemy's peace tricks. We know that compromise is death. Xu Ruzheng’s "When I Grow Up, I Will Be a Soldier Too," Chen Yanqiao’s "     ," and "          " are all very good. Besides, they are all quite decent. They are all meaningful works, which cannot be compared with the beautiful landscapes, flowers, and birds by elegant scholars and poets. However, in these works,      , there is a lot of praise for the bravery of the soldiers, praise for the cooperation between the military and the people, and affirmation of the victory of the War of Resistance. However, the dark side of politics, the fate of traitors, and the corruption of township and county chiefs have not been satirized, attacked, or admonished. In the current cartoons, the mission of resisting the war propaganda is of great importance, and it is more effective than other literary propaganda. With intricate lines, combined with light and shadow, and color, a successful work can truly control people's emotions, and it can be understood by illiterate people.</p>
<p>Chinese cartoonists and woodcut artists, rise up! Face reality, face the invaders, and use artistic eyes to</p>
<p>praise the War of Resistance and express the bravery of soldiers and the cooperation between the military and the people. Only with the cooperation between the military and the people can there be a reliable backing and great strength. However, the profound meaning of the implication and the beauty of the composition depend on the efforts of the cartoonists!</p>
<p>Work hard! Step up! For the sacred nation     , promote to the whole country, the whole world, and all mankind! Cartoonists, do not forget the important responsibilities at hand! Youqiu</p>
<h3>Introduction to "Captain of the Marauders," a Collective Creation</h3>
<p>— Youqiu</p>
<p>The three-act play "Captain of the Marauders" is one of the collective creations of the "   Art" drama department and can be said to be a great achievement of wartime drama. Its outline is as follows:</p>
<p>Yuan Zhankui, the platoon leader of a machine gun company, led his men to leave the team. He wanted to live a life of marauders but merged with a folk guerrilla team, and Yuan became the team leader. But Yuan himself was a man with the consciousness of marauders and bandits, so he let his subordinates harass the common people, rob them of their belongings, and thought that this should be the case, because the guerrillas were risking their lives for the common people, and the common people should obey everything and not be allowed to speak. Xu Zhanru, the original leader of the guerrilla team, is now the political instructor of the team.   He carries out political work among the people, but it is constantly sabotaged by them. The people treat his words as empty words. But he continues to work tirelessly and believes that these saboteurs will be educated and changed in action. Because the discipline is not strict     , traitors mixed into the team. Captain Yuan was also bewitched by Da Yun and Yao Ersao and threw himself into the arms of the traitors. They all regarded Xu Zhanru as a thorn in their side, plotted to drive him away, and arranged a situation of traitorous violence  , wanting Captain Yuan to lead the troops to a place close to the enemy, planning to surrender to the enemy with both men and guns. However, this plan was obstructed by the strength of the masses, making it impossible for them to proceed smoothly. Instead, in the actions of retreat and defense, Xu Zhanru was able to develop his abilities and pull back several of Captain Yuan's men, who became awakened. After the plan failed, the traitors revealed themselves, Da Yun was executed, and the   captain was also sentenced to death in the roar of the masses. The guerrilla team has become a conscious battle line, a real force of the people, and an iron tributary to resist the enemy.</p>
<p>Here, the growth process of the guerrilla team is the theme. It gives us the true face of guerrilla warfare. The collection of folk guerrilla teams is certainly unsatisfactory in the initial stage. But the implementation of political work and the re-education of members in action will turn the team into a solid one. Guerrilla teams are often imagined and mythologized, which is wrong. Here is the answer. The guerrilla teams are slandered as marauders by Wang Jingwei and others. This is to exaggerate the shortcomings and regard them as unchangeable. This answers this question and uses images to indicate the process of the consolidation of the guerrilla teams and its inevitability, which is enough to smash the slanders of the traitors! Therefore, the play "Captain of the Marauders" has educational significance for the people in the rear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can express the shortcomings of the guerrillas and their overcoming in a typical and graphic way, explaining the importance and arduousness of political work, and that it can only be successful with the support of an indomitable spirit, but it also shows that every seed sown by political work will germinate, and constant effort is nourishing water. Therefore, the play "Captain of the Marauders" has a major educational significance for guerrilla warriors and political workers.</p>
<p>The typical creation is very successful.    It does not dazzle people with the increasingly powerful   , but only uses living people to grab the audience. The characters all have personalities, and there is no formulaic stereotype, which is the  basis for the success of the technique.</p>
<p>Besparov said, "When a certain huge problem is solved in the image, the image has a huge educational significance." It is very appropriate to use this to explain the value of "Captain of the Marauders."</p>
