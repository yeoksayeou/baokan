<h3 id="c1">法幣價值的基礎何在？ <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 王慕聖</p>
<p>穩定了好幾個月的上海外滙市場，爲了港方七日來電，暫停出售外匯，於是波濤洶然，謠諑繁興，暗市英美匯大縮，幾無正式行市可言，標金陡漲一百五六十元，棉紗及其他各種商品價格亦莫不暴騰，而公債則下降三四五角不等。這種現象，一方面表示了人民對於外滙前途的悲觀，另一方面則表示對於法幣的誤解，以爲法幣一旦買不到外滙，就沒有價値，因此就趕快搜　黃金，商品，以備萬一。</p>
<p>對於作這種悲觀看法的人，我們首先應當向他們指出；法幣價値的基礎並不全在外滙，而萬一上海停售外滙，對於法幣也只有帮忙而絕無損害。</p>
<p>我們作這種觀察有沒有根據呢？有的！我們首先應當認識，中國現在已經是一個實行通貨管理的國家，在一切實行管理通貨制度（Managed　Currency）的國家裏面的貨幣，他的對內和對外的價値原是可以分離而建立在兩種基礎之上的。就對內而言，則只要法幣發行的數量能够和國內生產的數量作平行的發展，卽是說，不要無限制的濫發，則法幣與物價的關係一定能保持平衡，法幣也就不會跌價：因爲，澈底的說，在通貨管理的情形之下，法幣並不能兌現，它的價値完全决定於它與其他一切商品交換的比例上。戰後中國法幣發行的數額較之戰前雖然稍有增加，但絕對還沒有達到過多的程度，這是誰也知道的。因此，如果說，法幣買不到外滙就不値錢，這完全是沒有常識，法幣在內地不是照樣可以買米吃買衣穿嗎？其次，就對外而言，則在通貨管理的塲合之下，對外價値一方面固然要靠它在國外所保的金銀，但最主要的還要靠它本國的對外輸出的能力，假如它能够大量的輸出貨物，不管它是工業品也好，農產品也好，它就可以取得大量的外滙，購買大宗的洋貨，它的貨幣的對外價値也就可以維持。中國在戰後，對外交通路綫雖然大都被阻，但出口貨物因貿易委員會之通盤籌劃，出口數量並沒有怎樣减少，前途且甚光明，因此，中國外滙資源之能經常的補充與積壘也是沒有問題的，即是說：法幣的對外價値其基礎也是異常穩固的。</p>
<p>但是，假如在上海停售外匯，是不是就是表示中國法幣對外價値的跌落與對內的價値喪失呢？絕對不是。爲什麼？因爲：我們知道，在一個通貨管理的國家裏，爲了要保全自己的可貴的外匯資源，就一定要實行外匯統制，不使外匯浪費或作無益之消耗。中國現在正在求民族解放的艱苦時期，對外匯當然也要統制，但是，由於國際關係之複雜，內地進出口外匯雖然已在政府的全盤控制之下，在上海，却只能統制了一部份，卽統制了進口的，而沒有能够統制出口的。但政府依然在這兒出賣外匯，這顯然是爲了要維持英美各國的好感與爭取我們的對華援助。但是，上海已經不是一個獨立為主的地方了，在這兒出賣外匯，當然不免要被人家利用，因此，在一方面維持民主國的友好關係而在另一方面又要防止別人的利用起見，採用更進一步的妥善的辦法，使外匯不致作徒然之浪費當然也許是可能的。但這並不就等於說是中國的外匯資源已經枯竭，法幣不値錢；恰恰相反，政府如果把外匯資源很適當的很合理的移在內地運用，使寶貴的外匯不在這一所謂淪陷區中任人套取，中國的外匯資源只有一天天的增多起來雄厚起來，而决不是中國外匯的完了或法幣的跌價。</p>
<p>明暸了近代貨幣價値的特質，明瞭了上海的特殊性，我們對於中國外匯政策的演變也就不會恐慌，對於法幣的前途更不會存有絲毫的暗影。上海外滙市塲以後是不是要恢復原狀？我們現在還無法判斷，但照現時國際情形來看，完全把上海置諸不管恐怕也還不會，卽使退一步說在上海不賣外灌了，在內地將來一定也還會有一個簇新的外滙市塲出現的，因爲，不管是如何的統制，外淮多少終是要出賣的。而只要目的正當，用途必要，外滙也終於是可以取得的，不過也許不能像現在這樣自由隨便罷了。</p>
<p>一個國家爲了要求民族之生存解放，在合理的限度之內對外滙作合理的統制難道是不應當的嗎？而一般有產階級稍爲減少一點不必要的西洋的享受難道也是不應該的嗎？聰明的朋友應該可以靜靜心的想一想了吧？一般國民爲什麼還要爲法幣的前途作庸人自擾的担憂呢？！</p>
<h3 id="c2">世界動向一週間 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從廿八年六月四日至十日</p>
<p>這是震動人心的一週！</p>
<p>英國特派使節飛赴莫斯科了，英王夫婦在數十萬人歡呼中到達華威頓了，然而英國政府的政策還爲世界所疑慮，而侵略者的乘機作惡，則更加猖狂起來：在西方，德國『先下手爲强』，魔手深入波羅的海沿岸各國；在東方，日本一面完成了攻奪天津祖界的佈置，一面在上海竟敢濫殺英國僑民了！</p>
<p>另一方面我國法幣跌價事件，震動了人心，更震　了市面，對于英美態度，謠言從各方面蒸騰起來。但，正在這個時侯，國府嚴緝叛賊漢奸汪精衛的命令頒下了，它掃除大家心頭的暗雲，它表現中國民衆說話的力量和整個政治的進步，它更增高了中國政治與人民國際上的威信！</p>
<p>（一）史德隆緩飛莫斯科　英政府未棄妥協策</p>
<p>上週說到反侵略　綫之發端的英法蘇互助談判，由於英政府的態度不够堅决與積極，以致又告頓挫，蘇聯方面，除由外長莫洛托夫在五月卅一日發表報告以外，又於本月二　對英法建議提出覆文：（一）英蘇法三締約國中任何一國遭遇侵犯時，該協定卽生效（二）三國中任何一國因保障波，羅，土，希，比·芬·愛，或拉而捲入戰渦，該協定卽告有效（三）三國中任何一國因援助其他申請援助之國面被侵犯時，該協定卽行實施（四）締約國應卽討論技術的及互助的反抗侵略的方法（五）比項談判所產生的行動，應與國聯無關（六）締約國應彼此將原有的反侵略協定充分報告，每次接受新約前，應彼此交換意見（七）三國協定實施後，彼此不能單獨與對立者簽訂和約（八）協定期限五年，但得展延。英法當局對這覆文研究結果，據說已經擬成新的對案，英政府已派定外部中歐司長史德隆飛莫斯科，繼續進行談判。張伯倫於七日報告中，還說：「英政府會滿足蘇聯希望，準備成立一個以完全相互關係爲基礎的協定，同時明顯表示準備毫無保留的與法國聯合，如蘇聯一旦遭遇侵略，卽在軍事上予以全力協助」但是八日英外相在上院闡述外交時，則仍極力討好意德，表明英國尙未忘情於妥協政策。而史氏亦告暫緩赴蘇。因此一殷人士還懷疑英國對蘇的誠意，保守黨的邱吉樂已起而大聲疾呼，法國政界亦對英國此種政策表示不滿了。（參閱昨日本報）</p>
<p>（二）侵略者乘機大活動　怪消息反映新陰謀</p>
<p>法西斯侵略者原已在旁窺伺，看到英國這種態度，看到法政府的蹣跚泄杳，認爲有機可乘，便一面狺狺誘惑，一面霍霍磨刀。四日希特勒發表演說，竭力辯護侵略政策，向英法大肆峒嚇。並由德意分別從西班牙撤退一些侵略軍，向英法曲盡誘惑。接着冒用敎皇的『和平』呼籲，稱敎皇已訓令意德法波英各國，向各政府接洽召集五　會議，解决國際問題，制止「波爾什維克彌漫歐洲」，對英法少數反動領袖，極盡誘惑勾結的能事。同時，它們又『先下手爲强』伸魔手到波羅的海沿岸各國，首先　奪了拉脫維亞和愛沙尼亞兩國，在柏林簽訂了德愛拉『不侵犯條約』。而德國與丹麥的『不侵犯協定』，亦於二日爲丹議會批准。此外德意兩國還合力進攻南斯拉夫，意國旣在南國邊境耀武揚戚，佈置戰事；德國更約南國保羅親王到柏林，迫使承認五要項求，以圖從政治經濟與軍事上控制南國。同時消息傳來，德意兩國還正在覬劍南美洲的玻利維亞，美國務卿赫爾和玻駐英使館，都會於四日發表關於此事的聲明。而德意援助日軍佈置今後繼讀侵華與防備蘇聯的軍事工作的消息，本週內亦有幾家報紙刊登出來了。</p>
<p>（三）家洋×巧演兩面陣　英美法慘受三節鞭</p>
<p>上週的報告沒有錯，日本××對蘇聯對外蒙古的挑釁又無恥的屈膝了，雖然牠今後還會有不斷的同樣無恥的演出，但主要的牠將儘先選中弱者進攻的！</p>
<p>東洋××日本侵略者在此『歐局混亂』之際，便在遠東大變戲法，摹仿德意兩國今日在歐洲的兩面陣法，一面揑揑，裝腔作態，宜稱决不參加德意軍事同盟，繼而宣傳『英蘇談判失敗，英日同盟醞『復活』，更進而謠傳『英美出面調停中日戰事，英美壓迫中國屈服』（此在法幣　價之時聲浪尤高）凡稍明國際大勢的人，自然一目瞭然，這是東洋×子的×計，在於勾引英美法列强墮落牠的×稱，在於挑撥離間中英美法的友誼。另一方面，日×竟又　出惡煞的架子，除了繼續並加緊排外宣傳以外，還特別選中反侵略陣綫中最弱之一環的英國實行『全武行』的政治與外交的進攻，對鼓浪　事件固然繼續表示强橫，對上海形勢亦極力促其惡化，甚至於毆斃綸昌廠英籍職員丁格勒，（八日被有該廠英人離奇斃命。）此外更値得注意的是開放珠江談判的决裂，港粵佛山輪被扣；和長江問題的强迫英方屈服。尤可驚異的是繼英大使館武官斯比爾的慘被日×拘捕之後。隨員古巴又被扣留。而武裝奪取天津租界的準備，又在積極佈置，天津租界在今日再度陷於『滿城風雨』狀態了！英美法各國目前顯已痛受損害。允許與日方談判，是第一失策；壓迫上海各報及抗日份子，甚至代遞日×和平『條件』，是第二次上當，通令英僑向日軍領長江通行證，可說是第三次挨　了。</p>
<p>退讓　協的結果是什麼？東京『國民新聞』九日載稱：『日本必須驅逐英在遠東勢力！』</p>
<p>（四）羅斯福保證親蘇策　美利堅熱烈迎英王</p>
<p>世界和平的衛士，反侵略陣綫上最忠誠可靠的朋友蘇聯和美國的友誼關係，近來却日有進步，新任蘇聯駐美大使奧曼斯基，於本月三日向美呈遞國書，並致辭說『在日前國際局勢中，普遍和平以及文化進步，都已大受威脅，所以美蘇兩國相互友誼的增進，實更覺其極端重大，蘇聯外交政策，對於世界和平，具有最深的誠意』當時美總統羅斯福致辭，保證美國决心保持並推進聯蘇政策，他說『美國現正與蘇聯保持合作，今後更當發展兩國間的友誼關係。』此外，蘇聯與波蘭所訂商約，已於四日爲蘇聯政府批準；蘇聯艦隊在波羅的海的演習；美國總統以下之極力主張廢止現行中立法中不公平的禁止軍火出口條款，美國太平洋艦隊之於五日開始大操等，凡此一週來的消息，都可看出蘇美兩國對於反侵略保和平工作的努力。而更轟動世界的，是英王夫婦聘問加美，已於八日下午抵　華盛頓，全美官民，發出了狂熱的歡呼聲浪。晚間大　會中，美總統舉杯祝英王英后健康時致請稱：『全美上下，歡迎貴賓。近頃英美兩國關於太平洋兩島　屬問題的解决，尤增兩國邦交之友好，吾人希望兩國此種諒解愈趨密切，共同爲世界和平而努力。』英王答詞中亦稱：『余願英美兩大國將來能在和平的世界中比肩前進』，是的！如果英美兩國比肩戮力反抗侵略，則世界和平就會到來的！</p>
<p>（五）窺陝北晉西大鏖戰　論全局我軍佔優勢</p>
<p>一遇來抗日戰爭，還是沒有重大變化。</p>
<p>先說華中方面，自從鄂北豫南我軍打破了日×大洪山下大舉『包圍殲滅』的計劃以後，日×狼狽逃竄，一退四五百里，我軍乘勝前進，取得了控制華中×軍行動的形勢。月初日×處轉向鄂南，企區循濽江一帶，迂迥湘北，協同豫×，會師長沙·但經過濽江鏖戰之後，×軍卽失進攻力量。現在濽江之×，不能渡過東荊河；而我在新牆河北岸部隊，連日掃蕩殘×，勢如破竹，不僅已將原有據點克復，且仍保持包圍出陽形勢。贛北方面之×，連日倫渡　江不逞，鄂湘，贛邊，大致平靖，×打通粵漢全　的計劃，暫無實現可能了。</p>
<p>西北方面，一週來形勢轉趨緊張。日×分從晉南晉西進攻。關於晉南，×自六日起分兵三路企圖直犯茅建渡，戰事空前激烈。截止八日電報，我軍奮勇反攻結果，先後克復聖上澗，韓家村等地，士氣大握，形勢已邨好轉。關於　西，×由太原榆次汾陽一帶，調集萬餘，增至中陽離石，企圖西渡黃河，進親陝北，於是成爲本週戰事重心的大戰便在　西演出，我軍首於月初四日間，在冀城以南地區斃×千餘。繼×改採迂遇包抄策，由中陽離石分路向南北抄　，圖佔礦口，軍渡，三交各渡口，然後渡河犯陝，但連日經我反攻痛擊，殲×千餘，其勢又告挫落。據衛立熄長官三日談話及閻錫山長官五日談話，則可見西北方面軍政黨學與民衆，在統一戰綫上共同奮鬥，目前力足阻止×軍進攻，並且還在訓練百萬羣衆與三十萬鐵軍，準備驅逐日×。</p>
<p>綜觀全面我在軍事上確已全面的佔優勢了。目前×軍戰鬥力已發揮到頂點，各據點均受我威脅與打擊，力謀利用，我民力物力以爲補充。所以我們現在必須加緊展開×軍後方的戰鬥和進行反對汪×漢奸『和平反共建立新中央』的陰謀。</p>
<p>（六）跌幣價打擊×××　正國法嚴緝汪精衛</p>
<p>我國最高當局現在因爲軍事上已能應付自如，便集中注意於訓練幹部，改進政治，努力建軍建國工作。</p>
<p>不過日×及其走狗在精衛的陰謀毒計，却在加緊進行，在政治，在外交，在經濟，各方面那極力活動。這些活動是我們所不能忽視，而且要照卽加在痛擊的。</p>
<p>『法幣跌價』便像炸彈一帶掉落在投機市場。雖然一度人心爲之騷動，但是現在大家都已明白，這不關於法幣本身信用的事，更不關我國外匯基金問題，受打擊的，只是日×漢奸的『金融攻勢』，只是那些昧却天良逃亡資金的中國××，只是那些靠國幣供給其海外逍　縱慾生活的民族之蠢，反之，法幣本身仍然穩定，中外字信仍然保持，外匯統制與貿易管理更易實施，內地生產事業更獲得加倍發展的可能！</p>
<p>正在因法幣跌價事件而日×漢奸汪賊大造謠言之際正在牠們藉此事件以誣謗政府威信，挑撥友邦感情，和動搖同胞對抗戰信心之際，霹靂一聲，我國民政府終於在前　將士和海內外同胞一致呼籲下明令嚴緝日×走徇汪精衛了！這個明令掃淸了全國人民對政府態度的疑雲，這個明令鞏固了全國抗×統一戰線和提高了各線戰鬥的力量，這個明令更明了中國民衆力量的偉大，中國政府的忠誠與於民主政治，並且大大增加了中華民族在全世界在反侵略陣線上的威信！</p>
<p>然而日×漢奸汪派以及一切爲便利×人的頑固守舊份子，這一切阻碍政治與抗戰進步的逆流，在今後還會有更殘酷更無恥的演出，我們要在政府領導下，加緊和牠們鬥爭！</p>

<p>（二）師範學院中國自淸未創設學校以來，卽設有初級師範與優級師範學校，以訓練中小學師資，民國后優級師範名稱改爲高等師範學校，仍爲訓練中等學校師資之所，當時學風淳厚，師道尊嚴，畢業學生，多有終身服務敎育事業之精神，自民國十一年學制改革，高等師範多升格爲大學，于是全國除國立北平師範大學外，無專門訓練中等學校敎師之所，一般中等學校之師責，缺乏專業訓練，而中等學校學生之敎導，遂成爲嚴重之問題，二十七年四月，全國臨時代表大會，通過戰時各級敎育實施方案綱要，第三條曾規定一爲養成中等學校德智體三育所需之師資，並應參酌從前高等師範之制而急謀設置，敎部依據實際需要，於二十七年度籌設師範學院，初擬統籌全局，分區設置，繼以戰事未終，不能實現，乃决定暫設獨立師範學院一所，另將中央大學，西北聯大之敎育學院，各改爲師範學院，西南聯大之敎育系，與雲南大學之敎育系，合併改設師範學院。卽設於西南聯大之內，浙江大學敎育系，及中山大學之敎育系，與其敎育研究所，各擴充爲師範學院，以應目前之需要一從此中等學校師資，得有統一完善訓練之所，優良師資，行見輩出，中等學校之敎學與訓練，必將日趨改　，此誠孫戰期間高等敎育之重要設施也。</p>
<p>（三）國立中央技藝專科學校及各種專修科，開發內地，建設后方，爲抗戰中最要之國策，敎部特於四川設立國立技藝專科學校，辦理造紙，農產製造，皮革，染織，水產，蠶絲六科，又設電訊，汽車，採　，機械，化驗，農業經濟，畜牧，獸醫，會計，統計，衛生，工程，衛生行政等專修科，分令各大學院附設辦理，均定二年畢業，以造就各　高級專門技術人才，適應開發后方之需要。</p>
<p>（四）國立重慶商船專科學校，我國造船航運之事業，雖自淸末與辦，而數十年來，迄未能有所發展，抗戰以前，國內唯一造就此項專才之學校，僅有吳淞商船專科學校一所，不幸滬戰爆發，卽告停頓，以中國江海航　範圍之擴大，豈能置航業敎育於不顧，敎部根據國防最高會議敎育專門委員會之建議，特籌設國立重慶商船專科學校，網羅造船與駕駛專家，一面招生敎授以造就專門人才，一面研究設計，以應需要，</p>
<p>（五）國立獸醫專科學院甘靑一帶水草繁茂，最適宜于畜收，開發西北，應推廣備牧事業，以增加生產，當地居民，雖多促事於此，然畜牧事業，未見發展，則以疾疫死亡太多無法防治之校敎部現在籌擬辦法，以期及早成立，</p>
<p>（六）大學先修，軍興以來，專科以上學校，旣紛紛向內地遷移，各中等學校，亦同受戰事影響，而不能照常維持課業，靑年學生，大都轉徒應離，不能安心求學，二十七年度，教部辦理全國國立各院校統一招生時，各區投考學生，凡一萬一千餘人，錄取者雖有五千四百餘人，但一般成績，均未能盡合標準，其未經錄取者，成績更差敎部爲補救學生學業及提高大學程度起見，）。補習辦法，令飭各專科以上學校督飭錄取新生，加以補習，一面設立大學先修班，招收高級中學畢業學生有志　學而未經錄取之靑年，予以大學敎育預備之訓練，以便二十八年度應考各大學院校，此項先修班，己由部在川省各地辦理，學生學額，定爲四百名，已在成都重慶貴　三處分別招生開學，另由雲南大學及西北聯大各招收先修班學生五十人，修習期限，均自二十八年一月至八月，並因　陜方面，失學學生尚多，因令西北聯大增設一班，廣西大學附設一班，以資救濟，總計設立先修班十二班，可收容失學學生六百春。</p>
<p>（七）其他專科學校，此外各省設立之專科學校，經敎部核準者，有江薛省立銀行專科學校，　建省立醫學專科學校，江西省立獸醫專科學校，陜西省立醫學專利學校，均推行專科敎育之新設施也。　（完）</p>

<p>【中央社重慶十日電】記者以近日外匯市價發生波動，特向財政部探詢據該部發言人答稱如下：（一）維持法幣，爲我政府旣定政策。最近外匯平衡基金管理委會，對於調整外滙市價所運用之方法，旣未變更政府之政策，且係政府核准之措置。（二）因進出口季節關係，目前進口增多，尤以非必需品之輸入爲甚；故調整外滙市價，使之合乎於我經濟有利之標準，維持國際收支之平衡，更能鞏固外滙市况。（三）政府維持法幣法價，抗戰前後，始終未變。自管理外匯以還，公私機關，正當需要外匯，經財部核准者，均由中央銀行按照法價售給，事實昭著。至市價與法價發生差異，外匯旣經管理，此種現象，不特我國爲然。（四）政府爲減少市面波動，迭經飭由銀行維持，成績頗佳。迨外滙平衡基金委會成立後，辦理機關，更臻完善維持實力。尤見增加。（五）邇來政府更力謀減少非必需品之進口，並多方設法，鼓勵出口，同時節省外匯用途，冀以裨益我國之經濟，而適應抗戰之需要而。平衡基金管理委員會之實力，亦足穩定市况。余固深信各方對於法處之信心，更能增厚，絕不致因目前市面之波動，而受影響也。</p>

<p>我游擊據點星棋羅佈　×一增再增無法可施</p>
<p>【滬字林西報北平通訊】中國城鎭中之許多人民，其眞正之家宅與家屬，均在內地村落中者，今必已與其家屬失卻往來矣。蓋華北已判然劃分兩　區域，其間確然絕無何種交通，一方面爲日軍侵佔之各城鎭及四週毗連之小片鄉郊以狹隘之鐵路互相聯接，另一方面爲內地之廣大區域，大部份未遭侵略者之蹂躪，而仍處華方管轄下。今欲赴內地者，日當局對之，輙爲不喜，且成行亦匪易。因兩區之間，中輒隔以「無人地」，沌綿不斷者，恒爲被焚或摧毀之村落，不受雙方約束，游擊隊逗留其間。故內地各區之情况，今殊難探悉，僅偶略下居內地之若干傳敎士，或設法潛返被侵佔區之少數華人智識份子，乃得略悉內地情况之一二。</p>
<p>華北各地</p>
<p>茲將華北（黃河東北）中日變方控制區之現狀，槪述如次：（一）內蒙：多少在日軍控制下，但日方未圖適當駐守之。（二）緩遠：鐵路及沿路之城　，與狹長地帶，均在日軍之手，但鐵路綫以南之鄉間，與該綫終站，包頭以西之廣大區域，仍由華軍扼守。（三）察哈爾：長城外北區與沿平張鐵路之狹長地帶，在日軍控制下。（四）山西：經三度長久之竭力排逐游擊隊，今中部高原，太原西部與南部，以及沿狹軌的同蒲鐵路，直至黃河之狹長地帶止，均在日軍之手，該省其餘部份，則仍在華軍控劇中。（五）河北：東部（卽所謂冀東者）。北寧鐵路與長城之間，尙稱寧靜（當憶一九三七年七月之前。此區已在日軍之手矣）。中部，日軍揚言遠至黃坷之半途，已「肅淸」游擊隊。（六）山東：連接兩鐵路之區域，以及黃河以北，尙稱寧靜，但該省中部多山區與海峽區，仍在華軍之手，甚至沿鐵路一帶，駐有日軍處亦常呈不穩。</p>
<p>鐵路沿線</p>
<p>許多重要鐵路線，則去安謐尙遠，而深入內地之鐵路線，僅能供軍用。平漢線迭遭襲擊破壞，張家口與綏遠間之平綏路亦然，平綏路線破壞至甚，火車不通行者，已數星期矣。晉北平綏路之大同煤破，近數週來，已被破壞，不能工作，距北平不遠西山之里煤礦亦然，破壞火車迭有所聞。致火車已有缺少之感，甚至不敷應付此等區域中大減之載客運貨事務。日方處此情勢中，難怪其侵佔華北，幾及兩載，仍不能進行經濟發展也。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 宇飛</p>
<p>【成都航訊】四川爲古之蜀國。受山水　險之擁護，向爲封建勢力所統治。因此古蹟奇談，較他省爲多。然而有關於此次抗戰者，則惟今時成都東門外錦江上之「掘金」。</p>
<p>城東門外著名之古蹟爲「望江樓」。望江樓爲唐妓薜濤故廬，有「琵琶門巷」「薛　井」「流盃池」等古蹟，長年遊人塞途，因此成都市府闢爲郊外公園。近數月中，忽有人謂此地大藏銀鏹，並已有公司組織，在此地開掘，于是轟動全川人士，消息源達全國。關心者爭先探詢，記者曾數至其處，因事　涉近渺茫，數月中又未得發現，故絨筆候其事之開展。現關心者日多，謹作一個大慨的報告。</p>
<p>張獻忠仇視用川人，為歷史中古今罕見之事；當其握兵權而屠殺全川人士四分之三。後爲楊展華敗之時，而又將全川金銀，悉數埋於錦江中。丁文誠督川時，曾有人試掘，惟其地在彭山之江口，一無所獲。當抗戰一年有半時，全國熱烈獻金義賣之時，有「雙流」楊叟者，願在總動員下；出其智力，供戲國家。謂張戲忠藏銀之處，在錦江上望江樓畔。初人以爲其狂異，楊叟輒嘆「卡和之玉」無人能識。楊叟爲愛國心所驅使，見人便說，以冀得實現掘金，作抗戰經濟之補。事爲前川軍馬師畏崑山所知，乃集合同志，組織「錦江淘江公司」，商請行政院專司掘金工程，爲行政院批准，並簡派馬君爲特派員，負責辦理。於是乃有此刻轟動全國掘金之新聞。</p>
<p>按楊叟語人，謂其先祖係張獻忠部下，參加埋銀工作，爲張賊所殺。當其先祖死時遺言，謂金埋某處，可以代代相處。俟國家有大難之時，可掘發之。楊叟祖父爲淸時幕府，曾在檔卷中查明無鋘。楊對於搜集事實，曾費二十餘年之光陰，今年已七十餘，云如發掘不得，甘願抉其眸子，並殉以身。其堅信可知。</p>
<p>據「蜀碧」記載，張獻忠入川，禁止人民私藏白銀，若不遵令獻出，則殺之。嗣以張獻忠抵成都，人民聞令，卽將家中所藏白銀，夜間棄於街市。張令人搜集埋於附城處。並將埋銀人一律殺死，以免他人得知。因此知埋銀者多，而不知埋於何處，據楊叟語人，其數爲七千六百萬兩。以每兩折合法幣一元四角計，合法幣一萬萬零六百四十萬元，按照五成準備金配合，可發行法擊兩萬萬一千二百八十萬元。抗戰用款之今日，其數頗爲可觀。</p>
<p>錦江淘江股份有限公司，係私人組織，以掘得之金，百分之八十獻給國家，餘者留爲發掘工資。據該公司負責者談，二十八年二月二十七日，奉省府批令，委馬是足山楊白鹿爲淘江特派員，飭卽開工淘採，並擬具工程計劃備案，三月一日楊特派員等卽招集公司同人計劃開工。先成立驚事會，推楊白鹿，馬昆山，吳毅侯，羅祖南，張協華，辛蜀峯，范孔佳，李崇書，文超等爲董事。後推楊白鹿，馬昆山爲董事長再由董事會推馬昆山爲總經理，設工程處於郊外第一公園內，招工人九十六名，卽於望江樓畔，河流正中，開始淘掘方式。縱十丈，寬一丈，此係第一步試驗。經過五日，約掘十餘丈，卽侵水甚大，用土法龍骨車四架排水工作，七八九三日中，又加工百名，專往下挖。又深達一丈八尺，純系砂石派，毫無異狀，同時浸水益大，龍骨車四架，實不濟事，工作無法推進。董事長見工程停頓、非常焦灼，又恐春泛發動，目的未達棄其前功。乃架用汽油吸水機。十二日從砂堆右邊挖進，距水面四尺深，發現無數枯骨和人形晉四個。每個相隔尺許，證之非江水冲下者，據考古者謂，非一二百年內之枯骨，衆信爲張獻忠所殺之埋金工程人也。又下掘得血浸沙石一層，厚約五六尺，面積頗寬。經多數專家研究，此種砂石，確係人血浸漬，證以仁壽陳韶湘，「鵑碧錦」紀載，「張献忠自江口被楊展擊敗後，遂决意走川北，將所獲蜀府金銀鑄餅，及瑤寳等物，用法移錦江，涸其流，穿穴數仞，實之下木石掩蓋。盡殺鑿工子其上。」又證悉沈荀蔚「蜀難叙略」，『其所聚金銀以千餘人運之江干，三月始畢。如築决河法，小涸，於江底作大穴，投以金銀，而殺運夫於其上，後復蓋以土，仍决江流復故道』。依據以上兩說，足以證明浸血沙石層，爲献賊所殺鑿工運夫之血跡也。該公司同人因以上兩種徵象，相保血漬沙石層下，必有石條，十三日下午果於血漬沙石下層，及腐朽人骨下層，深約二尺上，掘得紅色石條數根，橫江排列。前後左右相接處均有桐油石灰。以水洗滌後，一石上刻有「張」字。循石進掘，石條陸續出現，均依岸排列，頗類人工建築物。又四日後，共掘得石條九十二根。多有刊刻字跡。如「天」「司」「上」「下」「兩」等字，不知作何解。又於東邊掘得「東正」字，北面掘出「北字」等。惟西與南字尙未挖出。據此衆信張獻忠藏銀原有界址。文有（一）字者，衆莫辨其意。有年長之學者，謂（一）或張獻忠七殺碑上之殺人符號？據『蜀龜鑑』載：「獻賊集諸生，人一元實，令頂於首，入西出東，殺一生，　　取一元寳。囘答曰，賣頭乎？殺爾者，還是我。獻賊屠川人，嬉戲如小見。』（一）者，此圈卽元寳，圈中一圓，卽殺人刀也？所謂殺人符號者，會意於此。十八日二十一日，陸續取石條，距石條下二尺許，又發現桐油，石灰，沙石等凝結之三合層。再將三合層起出，又發現無數腐朽黑木，四月八日夜十一句鐘時，工程週遭，突出現白光，狀似月色，光明約十餘分鐘始滅。監工員謝光前君，初見以爲詫異，喚醒司機生李忠義，相視驚異，又有車水工人四名，亦同見到白光。衆以爲天上無月，何來月光，光係大環形，環外無光。知爲異事，乃問考古家，據云一精金內含寳光，有時外灼；凡窖銀處，必有同色白光發現。」于發光前，曾在掘處發出河岸崩潰聲，車水夫驚駭，以燈視之，均無　，又鑿深二丈，水色黃黑，奇臭類似腐屍，于右角發現石牛，形式歷臥，頭向東北，牛約數千斤，其睡臥形狀，非水冲倒者。衆疑有作用。按四川諺云：「石牛對石鼓，銀子萬萬五；有人識得破，買盡成都府。」或係指此？衆人欣喜向牛首指處掘去，果得一石；與衆不同，半邊圓形，半邊方形，石之平面，左右凸而中凹，該處僅此一石。無其他石。衆信張獻忠思想離奇古怪，或另有用意？五月二日在石牛背後，又掘出石條七十餘根。仍有字及（一）字符號。石條下，均平舖無數朽木，木下有很多獻賊所鑄之「大順一銷錢。</p>
<p>掘金工程，正至此，據該負責人談，今後依然努力發掘，並聘得無線電專家徐韋立君趕製探金　器。後探試結果，下邊時起鐘鳴狀感應，徐君謂確有金屬物埋藏下邊。但是否銀鏹？與其數量之多寡？及塊藏深淺？尙不能十分肯定？該公司又聘張仲華金相其兩君。精研製儀器探　。據聞自開採至今，共耗工資萬餘元，然而該公司人等，仍以百折不撓之精神，埋頭苦幹，必得將金掘出，用以加强抗×之經濟。此係望江樓畔掘金紀第一次報告也。</p>

<p>— 戈寶權</p>
<p>二十三個月來我國人民的英勇抗戰，已向全世界指示出，我們是爲了爭取自己民族的獨立與自由而戰，是爲了反對東亞的法西斯力量而戰，是爲了整個世界的和平而戰；所以從我們這個神聖和正義的抗戰最初發動時，就得到全世界愛好和平的人士的援助。他們不僅向我們伸出了同情的手，他們還在精神和物質上給與我們以種種的幫助。</p>
<p>在這一個時期中，像國聯，國聯同志會和國際反侵略大會等許多國際性的組織，都在盡量地發動各國人士積極援華。國際反侵略大會前後曾召集過多次大會，號召各國抵制日貨；在去年七月間還又舉行了一個國際反轟炸大會，反對法西斯的××在東亞和西歐轟炸不設防的城市，及殘殺無辜的愛好和平的人民。此外，甚至就是第二國際與國際工會聯合會，在去年春初也通過了一個援助中國人民抗戰及制裁暴日侵略行爲的議案；國際勞工會議在去年六月間，也通過了繼續援助中國人民的决議案等。在個別的國家裏，英國有援華運動委員會的組織，美國，法國及比利時等國有「中國之友社」的組織，它們發行各種援華的雜誌刊物，組織各種援華的工作及遊行示威，並捐欵和贈送藥物來帮助我國的抗戰。</p>
<p>目前國際援華運動的範圍，不僅普遍了歐美各國、，甚至就是在南美洲，南非洲，澳洲，西印度羣島，印度，以及馬來亞半島的新嘉坡及吉隆坡等地，援華運動也都先後開展起來。而在其中最積極參加援華運動的，首先就當推各國的工人階級。這一事實證明出『工人階級是最先進的階級，是現代社會的最偉大的力量』，『是和平最堅决最澈底的擁護者和組識者。</p>
<p>國際勞工援華運動，多半是表現於拒絕爲日輪裝卸貨物，抵制日貨等類工作中。這也正表現出：各國工人已意識到：多運一噸廢鐵往日本去，多銷售一些日貨，就是幫助日本法西斯××多殺死幾個中國的兄弟，所以在美國有這樣一句警惕的口號：『買一雙絲襪，便是送給日本四排機關槍的子彈』！</p>
<p>我們可在此處舉出國際勞工援華的許多實例來。</p>
<p>遠在去年的一月間，美國的全國鐵路工會在布里斯托爾舉行過一次大會，决議抵制日貨並拒運一切戰時工業原料品前往日本。同月間，密德爾布洛的碼頭工人，决　裝運生鐵往日本，甚至因爲拒運鋼鐵而犧牲了幾天失業的津貼，這更是値得我們敬佩的。同樣的情形，先後也發生於倫教，利物浦，布里斯托爾及南桑浦頓等港口。六月間，南威爾斯的礦工一致决議實行抵貨運動。當去年年底時，英國大工業披市之一的曼哲斯時，舉行了一個大規模的反日運動，此外各城市中援華運動的遊行與示威，亦常有所聞。</p>
<p>法國的勞工也不落於英國之後，當英國密德爾布洛的碼頭工人拒爲日輪裝運鋼鐵時，法國馬賽的碼頭工人，隨卽表示響應，决定凡是一切供給日本作戰用的貨物，均拒不與以運載，當去年『五一』節紀念時，巴黎有六萬多的工人在巴黎的近郊舉行大示威，當時除向我國致敬外，並主張法國的勞工應積極抵制日貨來援助中國。</p>
<p>再看在美國的情形。當去年二月間，美國就有五十多萬的礦工，一致抵制日貨並反對法西斯的侵略。由於各種援華團體組織，在美國各城市中又曾先後舉行過多次遊行示威，『節食運動』，『一碗飯運動』及捐款等，成千萬的勞動者節省下他們一部份的微薄的工資，來援助中國人民。各海港碼頭工人，也先後拒運鋼鐵前往日本，舉如去年十二月間在舊金山，有大批工人拒絕爲日本裝運廢鐵，當卽有兩千多碼頭工人響應；繼而加利福尼亞州的長濱及俄勒岡州的阿斯托利亞兩地的工人均拒運廢鐵往日。美國的工聯於去年十月中在得克撒斯州霍斯敦城召集年會時，還曾通過一個議案，就是繼續進行在美國平已發動的抵制日貨運動。</p>
<p>像這許多情形，也表現在其他各國及各地。南美洲阿根廷等國，均實行抵　日貨運動；南非洲開普頓城的南非工人聯合會，也决議一致抵制日貨；印　則舉行過幾次『中國日』，有廣大的勞動羣衆參加，此外印度國民大會派了醫藥隊到中國來服務，在馬來亞半島吉隆坡地方日本人所開辦的鐵礦中，中印兩國的工人曾一齊聯合罷工離職，拒絕爲日人工作，像　許多情形，眞是不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>在這許多勞工援華的例子中，有一件事値得我們在此提及的，這就是澳洲工人對于我們的援助。澳洲墨爾鉢及悉德尼等海港工人，曾多次拒絕爲日輪裝運生鐵及廢鐵等。當去年十一二月間，澳洲坎伯納港碼頭工人，又一致拒絕裝運廢鐵前往日本。該港鐵廠布諾根山公司有三千五百工人，因爲擁護這些碼頭工人的援華行動，遂被廠方在聖誕節前開除。自從這件事發生後，澳洲各地人士，均紛紛起來援助這三千多個爲正義而失業的戰士。新南威爾斯的工友則更是轟　烈烈，召集大會，用無綫電廣播，擁護碼頭工人行動；但當地郵務局長竟橫加壓迫，將工會的無綫電台加以封閉。但是這種無理的壓迫不但不能發生効力，反而激起一個極大的怒潮。首先是澳洲五十八個職工協會的抗議，同時，由於各方面的人士，好幾處地方的總督，主敎和大司鐸的反對終於撤銷無綫電台的封閉的命令，而澳洲各埠的工人，於是更積極的擴大援華運動和禁運廢鐵往日本，從此也更證明出勞動者的力量之偉大，</p>
<p>我們特向各國的勞動大衆呼籲，使他們知道中國人民的抗戰，是爲了爭取自己的民族獨立，同時也是爲了擊個世界的和年，爲了整個世界愛好和平的　類而奮鬥。中國是世界的一環，中國人民的勝利就是全世界人民，首先是各國勞動者的勝利。望全世界的勞動者向我們伸出同情的手，同為了世　的正養與和平，同爲了撲減法西斯××在東亞與西歐的猖狂而鬥爭！</p>

<p>— 胡弦</p>
<p>偉大的抗戰，從「七七」到今天差不多兩年了，在這一次民族革命戰爭中，如同別的部門的工作者一樣，前進的戲劇工作者，是相當的畫了他們的職責。那成千成萬的靑年戰士，奔走在戰場，鄉村，揮着汁，挨着凍餓，堅强的守住自己的崗位。——其實，他們中　的大部份，在戰前和戲劇是沒有什麽關係的。他們選擇了戲劇這一崗位，說起來原因也很簡單：戲劇是最好的宣傳武器！兩年以來，他們的　用這武器發揮了很大的宣傳作用，敎育了無數的民衆。但是，他們也遭遇了說不盡的痛苦！（克服困難，揚棄失敗的因素，拮取成功的果實，敎育自己，成長起來！）</p>
<p>這些靑年戰士，兩年來馳騁於各戰場，在街頭巷尾，山坡草坪，和觀衆見面的，幾乎全是獨幕劇。（『活報』也包括在這裏面的。在戰地出現的多幕劇，那實在是少見的事！）這是好的！我們所遭遇的時代，是歷史上無可比擬的時代，對于在前線艱苦工作的靑年鬥士，我們謹致崇高的敬意！我們應當了解他們所處的困難環境，不該有過高的苛求！同時，我以爲獨幕劇在戰地，其演出效果不是親身經歷，是無從想象的。獨幕劇容易拾觀衆一價完整的印象，容易把　那極端緊張的時空。因之也利于作戲劇以外的工作——宣傳後的組織。（千萬注意這一點。在前綫演劇不是單純的演劇！）獨幕劇在主觀上，料於一個劇團的便利，實在是太多了：裝置，道具，燈光，演員，舞台工作人員，都可以得到處易解决因難的方便，在客觀上，觀衆不必化費很多的時間，而且有餘裕對於劇情來加以反復。</p>
<p>獨幕劇最大的缺點，長暗場的部份過多，不能如多幕劇一班把一個故事部分的詳儘的解剖給觀衆看，但是，我以爲這只是寫作手法的問題！（當然把一個題材處理到多幕劇此獨幕劇所遇的障礙要少。但是有些獨幕劇的題材，硬要拉成多幕也是浪費！）如果據此而根本反對在戰地演獨幕劇，（現在，居然有人在反對！）我覺得是不合理的！兩年來無數次的獨幕劇的演出，所得到的效果。那些令人感　的故事，只有讓戲劇工作者自己來述說。至於觀衆把劇中的漢杆當成忠臣，把大義滅親的母親當成了一天下最毒婦人心」的證據，我以爲這不是獨幕劇多幕劇的問題，這　及到演技，化裝，語言，和劇本諸問題。（劇本問題，自然比較重要。）</p>
<p>劇本在戰地，的確是一個很大的問題，抗戰以來，我們曾產生過幾許令人滿意的劇本？據我所知，在戰地上演次數最多的，恐怕要算『放下你的　子』『死里求生』。到現在還在演『放下你的鞭子』，難怪夏衍先生有他的感慨！但是，『劇本荒』却是一個顯著的事實，數一數出版的劇本，爲數的確不能說少！但是這些劇本，在戰地的工作者，是不敢輕易　他上演的，因爲害怕他在觀衆中起反效果，卽令沒有這一層顧慮，而有些劇本，叫觀衆看一千次，仍然是模糊，這似乎不能責備觀衆「愚味」，劇作者國應該反省一下，　是不難找出他的缺點來的。正如高爾基所說：『枯燥無味，沒有生氣，沒有個性。』又有些劇本，則流於公式化，千篇一律，觀衆看了上半截，就不要看下半截了。這樣子所收到的相反的效果，印象模糊的效果，我們能完全歸咎於在前綫出生入死的戲劇工作者嗎？我們能說這是被「獨幕劇」所防害嗎？</p>
<p>高爾基在同一篇文章裏說：「我們是活在深刻的從來不曾遇見過的極其戲劇化的時代表，我們是活在舊的廢棄與新的創造的過程中的緊張的戲劇化的時代裏。但理解這樣的人，祗有不斷工作的人。」（論戲劇）故解决一劇本荒一的問題，最好還是在市綫工作的人，但是，他們往往把「分工」這期望變成事實。更因實際的困難而擱置起來，這是一个不好的現象。生活工作在前綫的人，應該下决心來克服這個困難。依賴的結果，使今日感覺到荒蕪，給將來留下一個不該有的空白。我們如何給歷史來淸算這一筆血賬呢？</p>
<p>隨着「劇本荒」和別的問題，在前綫發生了另一現象，過度的重複與空白，有的地方，集中了許多團體，有的地方，却正期待人去拓荒，這是一。其次，團體集中的地方，演出的節目往往重過無數次，前一點屬於支配的問題，後一點屬於支配也屬於「劇本荒」的問題。關於「劇本荒」的問題，前面已經談過，支配的問題，可以兩方面說，團體的分佈，應該決之於各戰區政治部，演出節目應商之於所在地方政府。這樣子便可收統籌之效。</p>
<p>在戰地演出，還有兩個比較嚴重的問題：演員不敷，物質缺乏。</p>
<p>在前綫工作的純粹，戲劇團體，爲數是比較少的。一般的救亡團體，宣傳，組織，訓練，三位一體，宣傳的武器戲劇，歌詠文字，繪畫，照片，以至於口頭，用盡各種可能深入到大衆而爲他們所接受的方式。戰區面積太大，使每个團體都專門化起來，不獨爲事實所不許，而且不够分配。許多團體。尤其是有地方性的國體，比如商城學生服務圍，武昌縣敎職員戰時服務團，因爲要担負那一地域的各種工作，情勢非一般化不可，演戲自然不會偏重。旣然人數有限，一到演出，演員立刻感到不數分配。在過去，補救的辦法是聯合公演；但是這不是一個最好的辦法，許多團體不應該集中在一個地點，而且事實上集中的時候也幷不很多，那麽，聯合公演只能在偶然中來一下。我以爲最澈底的辦法，應該是團體的個性明　化，一般性質的團體地方化，專門性質的團體經常移動。但是要做到這一點，首先應該統籌。担負統籌　機關，是總政治部，和各戰區政治部，專門團體移動的範圍最好以戰區爲單位。</p>
<p>隨着這一問題的解决，物質缺乏也比較容易得到解決了，以往成千的團體爲了演戲，都各自要預備道具，服裝，燈光，……現在演戲的團體專門化起來，舉辦較易。——當然需要政府的資助！——政府資助，也不至如以往的困難。</p>
<p>前面說過，在戰地工作的成千成萬的戲劇工作者，大部份在戰前　戲劇是沒有什麽關係的，演技和戲劇各方面的修養，自然會感到欠缺，而最感困難的是導演的缺乏。在中國，話劇運動的歷史究竟還是很短很短的，於今一且把領域擴展到目前這麽廣泛，就馬上感到人材的缺乏，更何况戰前許多活躍一時的「劇人」跑到後方，與抗戰脫節呢？導演的缺乏，因劇團專門化可以得到部分的解決，但是，應該訓練新的導演人材，在開始訓練以前，應該從速編製關於導演方法的小册子，演技訓練的小册子，使一般的救亡團體有所依據，使他們依據這些适用的敎材，用集體導演的方法，來補救目前的缺陷。</p>
<p>至於方言問題，是比較次要的了。有地方性的團體，根本沒有這一困雞，移動的團體，如果以戰區爲單位，也不至成爲大的問題。演出的語言，自然最好是用國語。但是，有的地方，比如華南，國語是相當發生問題的，這就不能不借助於方言了。方言還有一個優點，觀衆聽來親切，但是，國語如果沒有「此路不通」的困難，還是用國語好。進行民族革命是從多方面着手的，當此民埃遭受着大困厄而空前的遷徙，空前的溶和的時候，語言的統一，正好利用這時機來加速的進行。</p>
<p>因爲在戰地工作了一個時期，今天僅憑一己之見，把許多團體在戰地演出所遭遇到的困難，零亂的提出，期望專家的注意，設法改善補救。時代太偉大了，偉大的時代正是一個洪爐，誰能和抗戰脫節呢？歷史是最無情的，他會吿訴我們，誰在沒落，誰在燬滅他自己！堅的工作者，會屹立在歷史面前的。我敬向他們致崇高的敬意！　六月九日香港。</p>
<h3 id="c55">台柱演員制的必然沒落 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 史超</p>
<p>電影的明星制度跟戲劇的台柱制度，毫無疑異的是資本主義裏的一種畸形的果實，返種藝術的不健康底過渡時期的產兒，它終會有鼓起自己喪鐘的一日是必然的，由歷史的無數複雜錯綜底合所得的結論所吿訴，或種制度的存在是有其或種時代的背景的，當超過這時代的肯景牠便會給另一時代底　角所取消而替代以另一種新的制度恰如封建制之取消原始公社制，資本主義制之取消封建　；……三民主義制的大同制取消侵略的法西斯制一樣的眞理，戲劇界的台以制終會給「無台柱　」所取消是毫無　異的。</p>
<p>在反法西斯的三民主義革命的戰鬥過程中，反映到戲劇界的是：一羣羣落伍的有名氣的　人的沒洛，和無數無名的民衆藝人的抬頭。這證明了由于資本主義制所支持生活的『資本主義社會底產兒』——『台柱演員制』，已漸漸走到牠底時代的愛力以外像殞星的脫軌消滅了一樣，終于給不打而自倒了。</p>
<p>……台柱制底黃金時代與沒落的先兆……</p>
<p>要充分知道或　制度的沒落之所以然，是有淸澈地了解牠底生長過程的必要。戲劇界的台柱制所由生，是有其社會存在的特點的，在資本主義底下的藝術品…甚至藝人也有變成商品的必要性的社會裏，經營劇團或劇場的主人，爲了要把作品當作商品的交換才能有鈸吃的緣故，便不得不被迫害着去爭取市楊，要爭取市場那是祗有出諸競爭的一途了。然而競爭需要更力强的技術，與優良的貨色的，因爲要有優良的貨色才可以踏上鬥爭之途，經營劇楊或劇團的主人，便不得不從無數優秀的演員當中去取更優秀的演員。更利用種種進步的宣傳技術，或給與蛟多的上演機會，使他成功爲一部份的表表者，籍此用他去號召被他所吸引所迷眩的大羣崇拜者——商品的購買者——以支持劇人的生活，劇團的生命。這便是台柱制所由生的因素——縱使這因素不是主要的全體，也必是全體中主要的一環是毫無問題的。</p>
<p>固然，台柱制是有牠的可愛底黃金時代的，尤其是在資本主義發展到最繁榮的時候，這些寶貴的日子直到現在還是蓬勃地生長在英美法…等資本主義國家的劇團或劇場中，披着美麗的彩衣在浮游着，然而不可避免地，由於資本主義社會的內在的矛盾日益尖銳深刻化，與藝術欣賞者的需求日漸提高，而漸漸開始在動蕩中，如英國的有名台柱演員兼電影明星的李安奴巴里摩等，因爲漸漸失掉觀衆的支撑而不得不退居副角，是很好的一個證據。</p>
<p>……台柱制對劇運的影響……</p>
<p>同時，台柱演員制的對戲劇運動是有絕大的防得的一點，是有指出的必要，通常一個劇團爲了要造成功一個台柱的演員，無條件地使他表演很多劇本，並且　他担負要角，這種情形便會很自然地規下了一个「紅者愈紅」和「不紅者永不紅」的機械的鐵律，縱使後起者有什麽超卓的演技才能，也　是落空的站在旁邊，永遠沒有抬頭的機會，埋沒了不少有用的幹才，直接間接地使戲劇運動蒙受了莫大的損害。更有進者，由於經營劇團或劇場的主人對台柱演員的重視，不自覺地會把他的地位提到高高至上，養成了演員底下意識的驕傲和不肯吃苦的不必要的惡習——是毫無意義更有防得到偉大藝術的成就的——　時竟因演員知道自己的名譽地位（原先是由劇團主人苦心孤詣所造成的）已有獨立自存的能力，便高舉遠引，投到別人的懷抱裏，置母巢于不顧。縱使不至斯極，而在劇團中的排演或彩排時，常常會因爲担當要角的台柱演員爲了或種不大正當的事不到，或不依時趕到，而担悮了排演的時間或把排演擱淺，這雖是小事，但對劇團的集體生活和戲劇運動的嚴肅性是有着不少破壞的。</p>
<p>還有更氣人的是臣到正式上演前的一煞那問時間是一分分地無情的快要將幕拉開了，而台柱演員還是珊珊來遲，或在開幕前一分鐘翩翩然趕到了，但又狡獪地提出了先支薪才演戲的要挾。（業餘的也會有其他法寶）在後台並不難會看見舞台監督或劇團主人爲了給觀衆催　開幕的掌聲所壓迫而滿頭冷汗的向台柱演員叩頭懇求化裝，而結果仍祇得支了全薪或半薪才算功德完滿的事情——當然，這是劇團主人底自食其果的好報應——然而劇人對觀衆的信仰已逐漸給破壞了。</p>
<p>……台柱制對演員的毒害……</p>
<p>藝術家的所以成爲偉大的藝術家，並不像藝術至上主義者或靈感主義者所說的是靠「天才」。「天才」——這不過是騙人墮落的妖精。徵諸已往的世界偉大的藝術家中，完全靠天才成功的可說是絕對少數，縱使有天才的話，也不過是佔努力刻苦的總和的一少部份，換句話說，他們之所以成功是靠刻苦的成份多於天才。像蘇聯的藝術劇場導演，蘇聯人民的先鋒，戲劇家史達尼夫拉夫斯基的所以成功，完全是靠他底光榮的劾苦和服務於蘇聯人民　術的偉大決心精鉀，而並不見得是靠什麽天才。</p>
<p>然而，台柱演員們往往是迷信天才的敎民。原因是他們在開始嘗着戲劇生活，或偶然的機會被劇團或劇場主人發覺——　的確不是一件容易的事——便被認定他是有希望能做成劇團主人所預期的台柱的時候，他（劇團主人）便很不經意地把「天才」之　戲到演員底頭上那麽一來無形中使開始是受寵若驚結果目空一切的演員，把「刻苦地修義」這句話忘个凈盡，而在腦子裏另換上一个「路不通行」的止步碑——，天才」。</p>
<p>其實，要想成功一個眞眞偉大的演員，是最低限度要做到像蘇　名導演F，卡威林所說的一樣：『…演員必須不斷提高自己知識，不能僅僅依靠在戲劇學校裏所學會的一些東西…』『在戲院裏居領導地位的演員，也要不亞于初學的靑年這樣熱心藝術，要使人人不自覺滿足；結到自滿與自慰的泥沼裏去，卽使最高的技術，最大的天才，也不免要　收下去的』。這點是有眞實性的。不過，迷信天才的台住演員們，長毫不介意地把牠丟掉了！名言的天使終戰隊不過迷信天才的魔鬼。</p>
<p>共次，給作爲台柱演員以更大毒害的就是『典型的做成』，上舉的李安奴巴里摩現在的所以祗能充當角的最大原因，也許就是他底演技藝術已經達到「典型」的境界所致。當一個演員據到祗是飾演某類角色底典型的時候、是早已宣佈了他的演技創造的死刑，從此便會漸漸給觀衆遺忘了。然而劇團的經營者是決不會忘記鈔票所給與他的力量的，爲了要號召觀衆，爲了要支持劇團的生命。無論如何是需要和利用一種像神一樣有着高度迷惑力的典型演員去競爭的。因此，台柱演員便是一個無件條的被選擇者。於是用種種機會使他（台柱演員）開始　某類角色的典型創造，專等了到成功不久的未來，也就開始着死刑的宣判——由於迷信者的醒覺或　漸覺得這神不能給他捫更多幸福的時候。</p>
<p>……打倒台柱制的必然與實踐……</p>
<p>無論對劇運對劇團對演員，都是有著毒害的。「台柱演員制」有打倒的必要是不必再說了，現在正確地勇敢地履行着的是社會主義的蘇聯，他們底劇場的演員，都是愛好藝術的工作者，無論對藝術修養或深或淺都是一律地過着平等的藝術生活，再沒有什麽「紅角」「台柱」的分別，至於電影也沒有明星制度。</p>
<p>最後我們所得的結論是：台柱制終會有跟着舊社會同死去的一天，三民主義的革命鬥爭過程中，是對一切陳腐制度毫不留情地　除的。最後勝利來到的時候，也就是一切舊的死去新的生長的時候。</p>
<h3 id="c56">天下太平的演出 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 唐西</p>
<p>革命的五月同時又是戲劇的五月，五月中，各大劇團都在忙碌地演出着，釀成香港劇運一個最大的高潮。接承着五月的戲劇高潮而來的六月，將基更緊張，更深入的顯現着。</p>
<p>作爲六月劇運號砲第一聲巨響的是紅白劇團第一次公演，他們以新的陣容來演出了新型的諷刺喜劇「天不太平」。</p>
<p>趙如琳在「抗戰喜劇在成長中」作過這樣的介紹：「幽默是抗戰戲劇中必需的香料，而現「天下太平」純然　刺此地所謂弊生夢死的某種人物，孳孳爲利的生活，這刺激，希望把一般人的茍安心理與錯誤的世界觀糾正過來」</p>
<p>誠然，「天下太乎」的故事是在特定環境　產生的，在「天下太平」里而生活的都是特定的人物，因此，劇作者賦予這些人物以多種生活的描寫，而一致地通過了喜劇的形式表現出來。</p>
<p>「天下太平」的演出，是一種新的嘗試，新的刺激，在劇本本身來說，它是一個新型的　脫了公式化，攝影化的劇作，在風格上，它是潑辣的，富有深刻而銳利的警惕性的表演。</p>
<p>導演對對於本劇的處理，已經達到一定的適當程度，他沒有使到劇本的演出流爲關劇或趣劇，不過對於處理一個喜劇應有的手法，似還未能飽和地應用，這是我稍爲苛求的一點。</p>
<p>舞臺裝置充沛着寫實主義的風格，渲染着鮮明的色彩，自然的角度，只是遠景的裝設不大像樣，舞台照明在一二幕里保持着　當的光度和光距，第三慕對於時間的顯示則不大明顯。</p>
<p>至於演作，黎伯鳴（徐國嶼飾）是一個很吃重的角色，飾演者對於姿態神情的模仿都已盡了很大的努力，演來還是不够細膩，動作和舉止都求脫化爲一個中年的人，三姨太（露露飾）自然地流露出角色的性格，是平穩的演出。四姨太（湯德飾）賦予角色以極其豐言和眞實的感情。內在的反應也很夠，獨是手的動作缺乏美化的角度。阿德（胡瑞華飾）的演出很爲細膩，而對於角色所屬階層的顯示不够，不過，這大半是由於劇本寫作的關係。金子章（李誅倫飾）對於一個油頭滑腦的奸商的現表，很能够運用眼睛利手的動作來帮助演作，只是缺乏深切的生活體驗。黎明遠（凌可飾）對於角色性格把握得很牢固，但姿態的表演老邁一點，黎明珠（蝶兒飾）咬詞饗亮有力，缺乏細膩的穿揷。黎明英（鍾膺飾）明達（石冰飾）力量根够，沒有深刻的表演。</p>
<p>在演出中，我們直接間接可以看到的：是紅白劇團同志們在極度艱鉅的物質條件的制約下，舉行這龐大的演出，已克盡了他們主觀上應有的努力，這倒是値得我們致敬的。</p>
<h3 id="c57">台兒荘之戰的創作經過 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 知微</p>
<p>「台兒莊之戰」是中國救亡劇團從活生生血淋淋的抗戰實現中通過了集體的理解和高度技術的集體創作的優秀劇本，在桂林，在香港，都有過幾次的演出，獲得文化界空前的好評。本文的作者，卽寫這作劇本的四個執筆人之一，從這篇文章裏，我們更可以了解一個優秀劇本產生的詳細過程，和他們創作的嚴肅態度——那種對於史實一絲不茍的態度。更可以人此得到一個向讀者介紹這劇本的機會。這劇本已在生活書店出版，爲中國教亡劇團　書之一；據編者所知，發行不及半月，初版已將告罄，從這點我們更可以知進這個劇本內容是如何優秀了！　·編者·</p>
<p>當我們吿別了大別山，從商城步行到宋埤去的時侯，路上，遇見了使人難忘的事。</p>
<p>那時我們已經路過了一百二十里的征程，目送着一抹殘紅墜落到這山的背後，天空又嵌上九粒晶星，已是黃　時分了。我們停歇在一個冷落的小站上，坐在茅屋擔前，親耳聽着幾位參與過台兒莊戰役的勇士們敘說著當時作戰的故事帶著一點激奮的粗莽的誇耀神情，那是一羣多麼可愛的　悍的凱旋了的英堆！我們想從那稀流的星光下，看一看他們的臉色，但夜色太陰暗了。　一有枚圓形獎章，昂然佩在他們的左腦襟下’放出異樣的光榮。</p>
<p>到了宋埠之后，幾次見到李先生，微微帶點風摩的勞瘁，但他的雍容，慈靄，却使人感到一種温暖的愛撫，由衷地想想去親近他。有一次，我們在司令部里演劇，李先生安詳地夾雜在幾百位官兵之間，靜靜的看着，露出無邊笑意，神意恬淡，誰都　有一點拘謹。真難料到這樣一位寬厚長者，竟是一身　天下安危的國家柱石呢。我們默默地想著，有這個使人愛戴的長官，有這樣英勇善戰的戰士，臺兒荘的勝利是必然的，中國的前途是光明的。</p>
<p>於是我們開始想演台兒莊了。湊巧，政治部的第四隊，第六隊都到了宋埠。一經商量，便決定來一次聯合大公演，所用的劇本是三　「台兒莊」，錫金，羅烽等諸先生執筆寫的。當時我們就感覺到這劇本的故事結構雖很緊凑，但缺乏台兒莊戰役的眞實戰事的描寫，未免是一個缺陷。不過，由於時間限制，我們只把劇本缺少戲劇性的地方，略略加以修改。</p>
<p>但兩次的公演却成了一個悲壯的結局：××向鄂東進犯，血戰方酣，×機第天都到戰區來窺探，宋埠雖是一個小鎮，然因軍事關係，都成了主要目標這一。在連雨了八天之後的九月廿六日早晨，天空剛只的出一點晴意，×機就接連偵察了三次，幷低飛掃射。當時的情况確實萬分緊張了，誰都知道今天將不免要遇到大轟炸。但爲了放在我們面前的是一個嚴肅的工作，大家都仍很鎭靜的執行著自己的任務。下午二時許，我捫六十多個戲劇工作者正　集在舞台上。忙於佈置，驟然一片沉重的轟炸機聲，迅雷似的疾捲而來，不容我們有騰身的工夫，廿七架重轟炸機直竄到我們的頂空。我們一時無法分散，只得堆伏在舞臺底下，就在這剎那之間百餘個炸彈已如密雨漉下，四處起著爆炸的巨響，屋崩橋裂，烟霧彌天，隔開我們二三千米達對岸的樹身，立被炸彈打得枝葉披離，慶土飛濺一齊落在我們的身上。而密集的機關槍，更不斷地猛烈掃射，斗大的小城，在毀滅的威脅下叶出衝天的黑烟。如此經過三十分鐘之久，×機才翩翔竄去。結果，我們的簫子英同志，四隊的僕紹哲同志負了傷·六隊的惠行之同志則當場犧牲了。臣死的時候，手里這緊執着一束繩索，是台兒莊劇中褂國旗用的。為表示我們對為惠同志的尊敬和哀悼，我們特地用了一幅染著血的國旗掩着他的遺體上，願他伴着烈士的忠塊，永遠在地下安息吧。</p>
<p>九月底，囘到漢口，見了白先生，承給了我們很多啓示。那遠夭精細的見解，使我們對今後的抗戰，今後的工作，都有了更深的瞭解。</p>
<p>十月抵桂，公演了十多次。感謝廣大觀衆的愛護，向我們提出了更熱烈的要求，同時，省方黃先生，夏先生，主持兒童保育院的李夫人，及廣西後援會劉先生，也和我們商量，要我們為捐募前方抗×將士　衣及兒童保有院基金而舉行公演，在這樣嚴肅的工作意義下，在這樣殷切的督促期望下，我們毫不猶豫決定再演臺兒荘。</p>
<p>於是，問題重新被提起了：採取原先定的劇作，抑還創作新的劇作？經過集體商討之後，決定由自己編寫。最大的理由，是我們要把台兒荘當作一個偉大的歷史，主題加以忠實的反映。自然，為了要使劇情生動活潑，在戲劇中，有時也不免用一個精鍊的故事，來貫聯首尾，但它的作用也被我們只限於此的。</p>
<p>當時　定執筆的，是王　，金山，睦知徵，劉丹青四人，而所定的時間卻異常短促，因為我們這時正在準備出國宣傳，為了避免這兩項工作的互生抵觸，所以不得不把寫作的時間，縮短到七天之內就要完成。以如此倉卒的時間，要寫好一個五幕歷史劇，幾乎使我們被困得束手無策！</p>
<p>但勇氣打破了一切困難，我們卒于動手執筆了。初次的分工是丹青構造故事，幷寫前三慕，金山，王瑩寫第四，五，兩幕，知微則和全隊同志負担的整哩之責，可是未等初稿完成，我們就用新的創作方法來代替了：四個執筆者圍坐在一起，每一段故事，每一個動作。每一句台詞，都經過了共同的思考和推敲才寫到紙上去。這樣在時間上雖然感到浪費笨拙，但通體說來，卻能使整個劇本得到比較完整精細的好處。</p>
<p>在創作的過程中，我們曾遇到過不少因難：首先是我們的學力與經驗，都還不夠，把許多丰富的歷史題材溶化到藝術中去，凝結爲完美的藝術作品。每逢感到這樣困拙的時候，我們常是抱定寧願犧牲藝術價值，而不願損害歷史真實意義的基本態度的，因之，我們幷不因遷就戲劇，而把故事作為故意的誇張，反納故事於歷史的軌道中，這就相當束縛了劇情的發展，同時又困顧盧到本隊人數的多寡，務使不影響到我們的單獨上演，也不得不加以適當的限制；在取村方面，則因我們手頭的書不多，只能根據些少的材料來參考，但也頗費了一番苦心的搜索。至於因要適合舞台條件，有時亦曾在某些地方略加變通，如果在劇中還有和當時實際情形不符合的地方，我們誠懇的希望得到各方的指示和諒解！</p>
<p>劇中人物要補充說明的，是關於詩人唐克和英新聞記者辛博生的處理。本來詩人是富於情感的，但有時却常常由於他超人的敏感，反被人漢視了他的熱情，而被誤解成爲一種浪漫性的衝動。在這點上，我們很費躇躊，到後來才决定仍寫上了，而所謀與詩人的任務，是希望通過他的熱情，把台兒莊的偉大勝利，傳達到成千成萬的觀衆之前，鼓舞起更偉大的抗戰力量。是否能做到理想的地步，那就全要看劇本寫作，和演員表演的程度如何了。英新聞記者辛博生，是一貫用同情的姿態出現的。我們相信，凡是國際問的公正人士，是無不以最崇高最熱烈的友誼來理解來援助我們中華民埃的偉大革命戰爭的！</p>
<p>化了七天的工夫，「台兒莊之戰」是如期寫成了。當時，因白天還有許多別的工作要做，抽不出空，倒多半是在深夜中趕寫的。四個人埋頭于一盞昏黃的燈光下，窗外吹進一陣陣的凉風，偶然也拖曳着一縷停在街頭叫賣的細聲，恍如又置身在寂寞的荒野中經歷着戰地的情景了。</p>
<p>寫成之後，我們先就作了一番檢討，引爲遺憾的。是關於人力的緣故，很多項勇將士和民眾幫助作戰的壯烈故事，都未能如實的搬上舞臺而被捨棄了。僅只能引用幾位敢死隊的壯舉，來摸擬一般苦鬥的戰士。這我們非常抱歉不安的。我們願意在這里補說一句，台兒莊的偉大勝利，是千萬英勇將士配合廣大游擊戰，在賢明長官領導之下，發揚旺盛的攻擊精神，才爭取到的艱苦的偉業。他們是中華民族最光榮的子孫。</p>
<p>此外，人物性格的不够典型，文字的不够細緻，都還祇能算是一個粗糙的作品。幸喜在我們召開的一次座淡會上，聽到許多文藝界朋友們寶貴的意見。給予了我們修正的機會。所以第二次的劇作，在人物和情節上，都有了和原作不同的地方。</p>
<p>承艾靑，林林，夏衍，楊胡，孫師毅，盛成，鄭延穀等諸先生供提了極多珍貴的意見，　尼先生幷在百忙中用書面指教，鹿地旦先生，綠川子女士，段先生幫助翻譯日文歌曲及日本軍語，謹在此一併致誠摯的謝意！</p>
<p>如能在我們的公演中，多少表揚也一點台兒莊之戰的眞實意義，那就是我們最大的榮幸了。</p>

<h3 id="c58">申報杯籃球義賽昨開幕　知行力戰克西南　中華大勝華雄甚為寫意 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>（本報專訊）籃球圈裏的女健兒、這次熱烈地參加申報杯義賽、爲難詢請命、俠骨柔腸、可歌可頌、</p>
<p>這義賽昨晚已在靑年會健身室專揭開了戰爭序幕、四路娘子軍、活活躍躍、演出連抬好戲、悅目可觀、座上高朋、那看得心花怒放、</p>
<p>頭棒戲、由知行及西南諸姐兒共同拍演、因大家賣力、精彩迭出、絕少冷場、</p>
<p>知行隊　、擁有陳榮棠、李寶珍、何德芳、林少屏、孫玉明、辜　攻等、都是輪老手、演出不凡、聲勢大、聯絡好、揮瀝自如、著手成春、故由始至終、佔居上風、</p>
<p>然而、西南打來亦够勁道、精神尤好、技術雖不如人、軍心則見一致、力抗之下、迭有所獲、朱縱纖和吳瑞心手叚甚高、常能乘陳而動、不過、遇着知行守將、穩紮穩打、乃沒法平反收局、</p>
<p>第一仗</p>
<p>開　後、知行諸鋒卽發動進攻說時遲那時快、榮棠小姐、策馬深入、籃底建功、跟著李寶珍也兩中「雀屏」、至此、西南方面始由吳瑞心囘報一點顏色、而旣已完第一節、知行十比四先着祖鞭</p>
<p>戰事重開、相持甚烈、西南諸鋒在對方守將刦持之下固不易得手、而知行的前頭部隊建功亦難、故第二節知行祗獲三球、西南則入兩只、總數以十六比八完了上半時、</p>
<p>第三節的戰情、亦如第二節一樣的相持不下、你攻過來、我殺過去、像得幾朶花爭　、煞是好看、至此節完時、紀錄牌上、高掛着二十比十一、知行佔先</p>
<p>最後一節、西南除了朱　織射中兩記罰球、此外無所獲、知行則由陳榮棠及李寶珍　、上添花、增多五分、總結果知行以廿五此十三得勝、</p>
<p>知行全隊演出、以榮棠最佳、傳射均見功夫、寶珍也賣力、但射籃一着、尚欠鎭　、孫玉明一女當關、威風八面、復屢予前鋒以輸送、間接居功不鮮、林少屏、何德芳等亦見平穩、總而言之、知行防衛尤勝於進攻、是一穩紮穩打的勁旅、</p>
<p>西南諸鋒頗矯捷、射籃均其姿態、惟因　被對方玉明少屏兩衛所阻、未能運用如意、守衛方面以李蟬卿最稱職、餘則平平、</p>
<p>兩隊戰績表</p>

<p>第二仗</p>
<p>中華對華雄一役、跟着展開、因實力一强一弱、開始後卽演成一面倒、華雄進展旣難、防禦亦不易、眼見劉守光、李純瑜等、不用著意裁成、一揮卽就、故華雄陣地、人仰馬翻、正是急雨桃花滾、輕風嬊子過、第一節完、中華已以十四比二大勝、</p>
<p>此後仍是中華天下、純瑜、守光等、有投必入、最憐小玉多能、反看華雄諸鋒、欲逞不得、與籃無緣、急得隊長雷月桂鬆髻頻頻偷掠、完上時半、五比廿二、華雄已現大敗之兆、——</p>
<p>休息片刻、再動兵戎、中華以左券　操、乃不爲已甚、饒惠貞後軍調作前軍、演出也得心應手、華雄則一蹶不振、第三節竟交一白卷」、到了最後一節、才由雷月桂幾度中籃、造出逾十數的紀錄、然終不免大敗、總結果四十七比十三、中華高唱凱旋歌、</p>
<p>此役在華雄方面、唯一足述的、則听獲十三分、俱由雷月桂一手經理、眞算奇跡、</p>
<p>中華方面、各個技術均佳、故能控制全局、前線守光輿純瑜、合作甚默契、彼交此傳、手寫文章、的是妙美、守將以對方攻力甚弱、應付裕如、全無孔漏、獲此大勝、乃技術優良應有的結果、（球場太歲）</p>

<p>昨天棒球聯賽、本由中華隊對美艦岷甸奴、惟該艦前日因公往廣州、昨晚始行返港、棒球總會方面、以該艦事前未有通知、未克另派別隊比賽、故昨天下午無棒球戰事、</p>

<p>本港中國婦女慰勞會　、爲籌欵救濟傷兵難民、特邀請東方會、小型足球聯會、國民大學隊、嶺南大學校友隊、於昨日午後在加路連山舉行兩場小型足球義賽、</p>
<p>事關義舉、各界踴躍赴會、計蒞場參觀者、有何香凝、吳鐵城、胡木蘭、　夢醒、宋慶齡及各仕女甚衆、情形頗鬧熱、惜天氣不佳、時而作雲、時而下雨、故不免大殺風景、</p>
<p>賽時、各球員以場地濕滑故、不免顚簸傾跌、笑料甚多、</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦九日電】世界奧林匹克委員會決定將原定在瑞士聖摩黑士舉行之一九四四年奧林匹克冬季項目、現改在加米母斯樞、柏頓、蓋秦舉行、緣瑞士最近表示拒絕負責舉辦本屆之滑雪表演、</p>

<p>該委員會今日在倫敦舉行會議時、興倫敦方面競爭舉辦下屆世運大會者有瑞士羅散、羅馬及底特律城等處、</p>
<p>該會並通過須發一特別獎狀與德國蘭母娖萊芬斯托爾女士、因渠負責攝影上屆大會之電影片、對於向世界宣傳大會之體育精神厥功至偉、</p>

<p>— 鄒魯法</p>
<p>榦部訓練的辦法、當然　要訂立詳細的方案、不是三言兩語可說得詳盡的、不過我們可以概述它必須具備的原則、可由各縣統計各該縣鄉鎮保甲長的數目、由各縣分別主持、分期召集、訓練的時間、須利用農隙、不妨碍農事、每年一次、每次一個月至兩個月、訓練的科目、須簡單切要、術科以國術、體操、跑步、以及必要的軍事體育爲主、學科則注重遝動必具的常識、</p>
<p>幹部造成之後、直接訓練民衆的責任、當然由保甲長來担負、同時各縣必須設置專員督導、分別成績的優劣、加以懲獎、各地中小學校的體育敎員、必須義務協助、地方上熟悉體育而熱心服務的人士、必羅致領導、這樣不斷的努力、社會體育的推行、或克有濟、</p>
<p>三、體育師資的培養與進修必須發行中心刊物——案中關於體育師資的培養興進修、規定設立學校、培植真正領導人材、設公費留學額、提高研究和設施的效率、服務三年、必須受短期訓練一次、體育高深學術的研究和著作、從事奬勵等、可謂思慮周詳、不過體育敎育、日新月異、同志研究的結果、也時有新的心得、倘必須經過三年的時間、才得吸收一次新學術、或同志研究所得、沒有交換的機會、新學術和新方法、必難及時獲得、及時應用、且體育敎育在敎學的過程中、陷時有疑難問題發現的可能、倘不能力謀解決辦法、正確途徑、也無由確實求取了、與修養的本旨、改進的企圖、不是大相逕庭嗎、</p>
<p>要補救這種缺憾、惟有由全國最高體育行政機關、分別大中小各級學校、及社會體育、體育行政等發行定期的中心刊物、通令隸屬於各該機關的體育服務人員、必須分別訂閱、凡政府的體育法令、國外的體育新發見、國內的體育新興革、同志的體育新心得、都逐一刊載、尤其各同志所發生的疑難問題、可以隨時質詢、由最高體育機關負責解答、不能解答的、可公開討論、迅速取決、這樣不但體育敎師、可以隨時獲得進修的機會、而體育敎育的一切改進問題、也可以隨時解决了、</p>
<p>上述三端、推行社會體育一層、表面上看來、似乎有些不能、但今日我國的民衆、已覺醒起來、組織起來了、一般人認爲不可能的事、目前都能順利推行的、不勝枚舉、如全國的社會軍訓、廣西的成人敎育、都是很好的例子、而廣西的成人敎育、就是利用鄉鎭保甲長來推行的、所以政府倘是有決心的話、用政府的權力、把推行軍訓的方法來推行敎育、我想我們覺醒的民衆、一定是樂於接受的、其餘二事、就更覺輕而易舉了、希望握全國體育最高權力的、和編訂今後我國體育實施方案的、注意及之、</p>

<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>（譯密勒氏評論報）：</p>
<p>自戰事爆發以來、沿海岸和沿江城市裏的中國工　、已有二百八十家、資本共的四千萬元、遷入西南緒省各城市、共中百分之五十以上、屬於紡織業、它的資本、勞動力、出產和運轉力量、以前佔中國所有工廠總數的三分之一到三分之二、</p>
<p>中日戰爭開始、日方就已宣佈發展在華棉業的許多動人計劃、並說鉅額日本資金、等着投資此業、但至今爲止、這些計劃無一實現、甚至毀於戰事的靑島日本紗廠、現時祗以極度遲延的步伐在重建中、範圍也很小、　說日方不從日本運新機器來、而已在佔據區的華方紗廠裏運走很多的機器、尤其是英美製造的機噐、用來裝在日方的舊紗廠中、</p>
<p>日方統制在華棉業的野心計劃、由來已久、自一九〇〇年內外社會在上海開設第一家紗廠起、日人就已研究而知道紗和棉布以及華工的心理、戰前日方已裝還或購買在華　子總數的二分之一左右、</p>
<p>中國輸入紡織機器及其附件、日本絕對地居首位、但輪入的日本紡織機器、很多是陸錠和自大阪運華的織布機、日方在華所獲巨額商業上的戰利品、是顯而易見的、它的數字也可表示其他國家從前在中國各重要市場上的質易、遭受巨大的損失</p>
<p>日方旣這樣統　着棉貨的製造、遝輸和買賣、以及紡織品和紡織機噐的輸入、又已成立棉產及銷統制委員會它的目的是顯而易見的、原棉自華北輸出、今已被置在「北平臨時政府」的領照制度下、購棉的一政府「代理機關已在天津、濟南和靑島設立、去年間、華北所能得到的棉花、約有三分之二都運往日本、並將准不再許華北棉花續運入華中、日方對運輸原棉、在途中實行徵收名謂「保護」稅的雜稅、藉以擴張其完全統制原棉的運輸、例如一担棉花自通州運到上海、以前所費約三元、現在所費、包括各種賦稅在內、　趨十八元之多、他的作用是可想而知的、</p>

<p>— 葉熾强</p>
<p>忽然想到「十」，我便抓住做題材，</p>
<p>寫「十」，世界上大槪不會有腦筋簡單到如你這步田地的人吧！</p>
<p>但是，我沒有計較到這一層；一橫一直，雖然不是萬有文庫，要亦不能否認大道理包含其間，所以硬着頭皮，模倣孔老先生的吶喊：「天乎！吾道一以貫之！」——我這樣想。</p>
<p>中國人一向歡喜這個「十」，視「十」如飴，例證毛起。</p>
<p>孟子總算縱橫戰國時候的一個了不起的「予豈好辯哉」的「吃講先生」了，然而他也往往把言行釘在這十字架上來。</p>
<p>「——掘井九仞，而不及泉，猶爲棄井也。」</p>
<p>大槪加一仞，凑成十仞，便不至於棄井了…苦口婆心。說到九仞上來，已經艱巨工深了，然而只留一仞地段，敎人以毅力之處，未免「杯水奧薪」的「杯水輿薪」！因此，我厭惡「十」字，這個終止的數目，象微了一切止境。</p>
<p>我們固然不希望「罪惡滔天」，然而數起罪狀來，據魯迅先生的結論：『普通鄒是十條』，也許又是一　「十全十美」的作祟吧！</p>
<p>古人常常說「十手所指，十目所視。」照普通觀察，人類如果尚未進化到「三頭六臂」的時候，無論『十手』或「十目』，要不外乎五個人，五口之家，無以爲衣，無以爲食，更無以爲敎，則這所謂「十目十手」指視之下，也何嘗不是造成罪惡貫盈的淵藪呢？而且顧盼之間，或許便是革命的原動力。</p>
<p>所以，古人在這個十七，便常常得到撲空的痕跡。同樣，五千年來號稱文物之邦，能殼造成盡美矣，又盡善也的中庸性，論功行賞，這個「十」，多少是幫助或授意從的。</p>
<p>從「十滴藥水」，到　「十方施主」，這個社會裏層，不知道要包含了無數千萬的十字哲學。（姑且這樣說吧。）而——『十』之爲『十』，也就故步自封，希望只停留在「十全十美」上，那就吿訴我們辦到「十不全」也是一件非常容易的事情。</p>
<p>西湖不就是現在淪於鐵蹄之下，我才這樣感覺到的，老早就說過不止『十景』的，除却現在「殺風景」或添上一幅『銅駝荊棘圖』不算外，我曾經用直覺或靈感，體味出西湖至少有『三百七十九又半景』，這所謂半者，在我馬傯倥、霹靂一聲，驚破記者得很牢的『口令』而在湖邊拉馬囘頭的最後半囘欣賞也。我每次臨了那種環境，每次都有幾十種景緻讀出來！然而普通祗准『西湖十景』；這明明又是『十』在作祟而壟斷一切了。</p>
<p>囘到上海以後，安身的仍然是『十里洋場』雖然沒有餘暇來計算是否眞正的十里，但是吃到廣東店裏的『十景炒飯』之後，無意中發現了『叉燒』的的被尅扣，而店東還是『十景十景』！恍然欺世盜名，莫此爲甚！這又是直接使我懷疑起『十來』。</p>
<p>『十』在我們的社會裏，起許多許多前進上的障碍物，散播了無數千萬苗而不實的種子，以爲『十』總算盡美盡善，標「十」而進，所進僅矣，把「十」凝結在整個社會潛勢力之下，中庸之尤者的了！如果『湯之盤銘苟日新，日日新，又日新。』的話有存在的價値，那末這個『十』應該是唾棄的，自强不息，原來不該有「十」來封步，拉下十字的間架，突飛猛進地超越過去，這是否吾人所當共勉的。</p>
<p>「十字街頭」，豈容再事腳躅！作「十」以抨擊寫陋。</p>
<h3 id="c70">從成都到西安 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>二、這就是縣城嗎？</p>
<p>晨七時，車子從綿陽開出，十時半抵梓潼，停車吃午飯。從成都起程的前兩天，偶然在報上看到行政院褒獎梓潼縣縣長的新聞。說是該縣長年靑英俊，努力工作，到任未久，條理井然，特傳令嘉獎。如今到了梓潼縣城，實在還不知這究竟是怎麽一個地方。一條街，幾十家舊式木造商店。人民窮苦，衣服全是襤縷得條乞丐。生活程度可也不低。吃飯炒　片五角，蛋花湯一角，飯每碗五分，也是粗黑得不能進口。飯後，繼續起行，經劍閣縣，昭化縣，到廣允縣城，已是入夜十時了。找不到旅館，車子開進車站的棧房，讓乘客自由行動。大家頗爲徬徨。有一部分人携着行李找熟人或獨自找旅館去了，剩下來一部分，派了兩位較爲熟識地方情形的人找旅館去，半個鐘頭囘來，說找到了，車子就開到那旅館門口去族館的名字叫一同康客棧」。把李搬進客棧裏，洗洗臉，已是十一點了。肚子也不覺得餓，心頭只是感到恐怖的重壓。因爲這一天，從上車到下車，整整十五個鐘頭中，都下着霏霏的微兩，刮着大風，自己衣服已穿得單薄，大衣又被雨水全淋濕了，一陣陣寒冷凍着心肺，自己的身體是弱到極點了，四年前大病，到如令實在還沒有完全恢復原神，萬一被寒　冷雨一打，輕則感冒，重則肺炎，則這脆弱的生命（雖非軍人）但大有「出征未捷身先死」之處了。</p>
<p>從綿陽到廣元，共經四個縣。每個縣的縣城，就是那麽兩三條小街，商店全是木造小平房。沒有電燈，沒有自來水，居民識字的很少，完全沒有一點兒現代文明氣象。這些縣城，還是因爲地當交通要衝。才有這樣的「繁榮」。同康客棧有一對聯云。「閱四海往來過客，作一日倉猝主人」；又在另一客棧門口的燈籠上，用紅漆油寫着『鷄鳴不留』這就是充分表明這些所謂縣城的性質了。縣城如此，鄉村間的原始狀態，不是可想而知嗎？我是南方人，我的家鄉是華僑最多，也是被國人譽爲最有錢的縣份。華僑很早就把西洋文明帶囘來，築了鐵路，開關了馬公路，縣城的繁華，被譽爲小廣州；市鎭也開闢了寬廣的士敏土馬路，甚至鄉村裏，隨處可見二三層樓的洋房于，小汽車可以直達鄉村裏的門口。在這樣的搖籃裏長大起來，又在上海，香港那樣的資本主義的都市住慣了的我，初初走到這樣的地方來，每到一個縣城，輒　問：這就是縣城了嗎？而慨嘆這些地方的沒有受到西洋文化的洗禮了。</p>
<p>從綿陽起，卽漸入山嶺地帶，山上旣無菜麥，也無草木，都是不之地的一片黃褐色，其地方之高學瘦瘠，于此可見一般。在劍閣縣境，有劍門關。十幾個高聳雲零的山峯，峭然壁立，峯尖積雪，宛如銀柱，南北兩面，只有一個關口，分成人字通形過。在我國的戰史上，雖沒有著名的大戰在這裏打過，但假如眞有大戰在這裏打，那必將是「一夫常關，萬夫難入」的險關了。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c71">喜色 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>大地又迎着艷麗的春囘來了。</p>
<p>李夫人坐在廊下陽光裏，靜靜地爲女兒打着毛綫衫，四隻鋼針不停的舞動，發出閃閃的反光。院子角裏一枝梨樹，蓓蕾已綻開來了，地磚縫裏也有小草在伸出頭來。</p>
<p>鋼針不停的動着，毛綫衫一分分長起來，眼前忽然織成一片陰鬱的網，這紅色的一片，微微　動著的，象徵若從胸口流下來紅的血！李夫人深悔選擇這種喜色，</p>
<p>嗤一聲，一隻貓從門後直竄出來，竄上那株梨樹，接着鬥裏追出了小蘋，拖着竹枝，追到樹下，舉起來舞動着向樹上示威，穿着嫩綠的絨綫衫，包得鼓鼓地。李夫人嘆一口氣，把針線放在膝上，又閉了閉眼，叫聲「小蘋」，小蘋把身子一扭，唔了一聲，表示不肯干休，那貓一囘身跳上樹後的墻，幾跳轉上後面的屋頂去了。</p>
<p>小蘋懊喪地囘過身來，伸長頸向屋上望，太陽迫得她眯細了服。</p>
<p>「小蘋！」小蘋聽得媽叫，就奔到媽這裏來，伏在她膝上，哇的一聲哭了。孩子受着貓的委屈，眼淚不自主的流，李夫人趕忙推開，抽出那打着的毛綫衫，已有好幾顆豆大的淚珠晶瑩地在毛上滾。李夫人拍着小蘋的背，連聲說：</p>
<p>「別哭，別哭，站起來試一試身材！」</p>
<p>她拉開那半截的毛線衫，向小蘋頭上套下一直套到肚皮，小蘋一陣揉搓，仰着頭，半哭半笑說：</p>
<p>「爸爸看見了，又要說紅孩子，紅孩子了！」</p>
<p>「紅孩子不好嗎？」李夫人一面替她脫下，一面說。</p>
<p>「媽，你說爸爸到底要不要回來呢？他在那裏幹嗎呀？一個人老蹲在天盡頭不要囘來看看嗎？」</p>
<p>「他在天盡頭替我們打哩！打完了纔得囘來看小蘋！李夫人放好綫，兩手把小蘋抱到膝上，看着她圓睜着雙眼，自己喉音似乎有不自然起來，心裏煩煩的，凑近去小蘋的嫩頰上吻了吻，小蘋拿小手摟持開來，驚異地問：</p>
<p>『媽，你也哭嗎？眼淚滴到小蘋的面上來了。』</p>
<p>『媽媽沒有哭，眼淚是小蘋的，媽媽是大人，大人不會哭。』李夫人眞有些忍不住，喉昔格外異常了。</p>
<p>「爸爸不打小蘋，他會打惡人？媽，你要寫信，別忘了叫爸爸買一個大國囡囘來，小蘋頂喜歡囡國。」小蘋騎在李夫人滕上一跳一跳的，一隻小手在李夫人面上儘摸，濕濕的淚從她指縫裏消到手背上。</p>
<p>那日影已偷偷地閃出廊外去了。一樹梨花，似乎在微笑。角門忽然呀的一聲，推了開來，探進一個護士嶉的頭，臉上滿是笑：</p>
<p>「小蘋，喂！」</p>
<p>小蘋囘過頭　，掙着跳下來，向這邊奔去，張開兩手，叫：</p>
<p>「媽姨；姨媽！」</p>
<p>姨媽跑進來，豚下去，抱起小蘋，一面走，一面在頰上吻了又吻，笑着叫：</p>
<p>「姊姊，你看我裝作這個樣子，小蘋還不怕？」說着在姊姊面前把身子旋了一轉·李夫人點點頭，笑着說：</p>
<p>「學會了包紮了嗎？看見了血還怕嗎？」</p>
<p>「那裏的話，幾時我怕遇血來？」她抱着小蘋在李夫人旁邊的一張凳子上坐下，把小蘋放在膝上，一抖一抖抖抖得高高的。</p>
<p>你不怕血，我倒討厭這紅，紅象徵血，結着這紅毛綫衫就像從胸口流出來的大片血！」李夫人抽出那未完的毛綫衫，抖開來，向她妹妹面前一幌，「我心上就不能想到血，這東西僞偏引我想，你還說是喜色！自己病的時候倒不覺得，人家病了，看不見，那纔累人！心上老掛着一件什麽似的，摟又模不着，吐又吐不出，我眞够受了！我願意自己到外邊去，做些事，讓人家記掛我，我眞不願意再記掛人！你們綫痛快，跳呀奔的，爲國家出了力，又自已吐了氣。我這種坐着守着，一些有用的事不能幹，看著你們空羨慕。」</p>
<p>『得咧，姊姊，你又發揮了這一陣，』妹妹笑喀嘻地扯下護士帽，『什麽叫做本位上努力？你要限我去，就是小蘋沒有辦法。』她其實找不到什麽話來安慰姊姊。</p>
<p>窗裏嘶嘶地嚮起來，是小弟開着唱片的聲音：</p>
<p>「……起來，不有願做奴隸的人們……」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">What is the Basis of the Legal Tender's Value? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Musheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange market, which had been stable for several months, suspended the sale of foreign exchange due to a telegram from Hong Kong seven days ago, causing turbulent waves, rampant rumors, and a sharp contraction in the black market exchange rate for British and American currencies, with almost no official market rate to speak of. The price of gold skyrocketed by one hundred fifty to sixty yuan, and the prices of cotton yarn and other commodities also soared, while public bonds fell by three, four, or five jiao. This phenomenon, on the one hand, indicates the people's pessimism about the future of foreign exchange, and on the other hand, it shows a misunderstanding of the legal tender, believing that once the legal tender cannot buy foreign exchange, it has no value, so they rush to hoard gold and commodities to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>For those who hold this pessimistic view, we should first point out to them that the basis of the legal tender's value is not entirely in foreign exchange, and that even if Shanghai suspends the sale of foreign exchange, it will only help the legal tender and not harm it.</p>
<p>Do we have any basis for making this observation? Yes! We must first recognize that China is now a country that implements currency management. In all countries that implement a managed currency system, the internal and external value of its currency can be separated and established on two different bases. Internally, as long as the amount of legal tender issued can develop in parallel with the amount of domestic production, that is, it should not be issued indiscriminately without limit, then the relationship between the legal tender and commodity prices will definitely be able to maintain a balance, and the legal tender will not depreciate. Because, fundamentally speaking, under currency management, the legal tender cannot be redeemed, and its value is entirely determined by its exchange ratio with all other commodities. Although the amount of legal tender issued in China after the war has increased slightly compared to before the war, it has definitely not reached an excessive level, which is known to everyone. Therefore, to say that the legal tender is worthless if it cannot buy foreign exchange is completely ignorant. Can't the legal tender still buy rice and clothes in the inland? Secondly, externally, under currency management, the external value depends on the gold and silver it holds abroad, but the most important thing is its own country's ability to export. If it can export a large amount of goods, whether they are industrial products or agricultural products, it can obtain a large amount of foreign exchange to purchase bulk foreign goods, and the external value of its currency can be maintained. Although most of China's foreign transportation routes have been blocked after the war, the number of export goods has not decreased much due to the overall planning of the Trade Commission, and the future is very bright. Therefore, there is no problem in the constant replenishment and accumulation of China's foreign exchange resources, which means that the basis of the legal tender's external value is also extremely solid.</p>
<p>However, does the suspension of foreign exchange sales in Shanghai mean a drop in the external value and a loss of internal value of China's legal tender? Absolutely not. Why? Because we know that in a country with currency management, in order to protect its valuable foreign exchange resources, it is necessary to implement foreign exchange control to prevent foreign exchange from being wasted or used for useless consumption. China is now in a difficult period of seeking national liberation, and foreign exchange must of course be controlled. However, due to the complexity of international relations, although the import and export of foreign exchange in the inland areas are under the government's overall control, only a part of it has been controlled in Shanghai, that is, the import, but not the export. However, the government is still selling foreign exchange here, which is obviously to maintain the goodwill of the United Kingdom and the United States and to win our aid to China. However, Shanghai is no longer an independent place, and selling foreign exchange here will inevitably be exploited. Therefore, in order to maintain friendly relations with democratic countries on the one hand and to prevent others from taking advantage on the other hand, it may be possible to adopt further and more appropriate measures to prevent foreign exchange from being wasted in vain. But this does not mean that China's foreign exchange resources have been exhausted and the legal tender is worthless. On the contrary, if the government appropriately and rationally transfers foreign exchange resources to the inland for use, so that precious foreign exchange is not taken advantage of by anyone in this so-called occupied area, China's foreign exchange resources will only increase and become stronger day by day, and it will never be the end of China's foreign exchange or the depreciation of the legal tender.</p>
<p>Having understood the characteristics of the value of modern currency and the particularity of Shanghai, we will not panic about the evolution of China's foreign exchange policy, and we will not have the slightest shadow on the future of the legal tender. Will the Shanghai foreign exchange market return to its original state in the future? We cannot judge now, but judging from the current international situation, it may not be possible to completely ignore Shanghai. Even if we take a step back and say that foreign exchange will not be sold in Shanghai, a brand-new foreign exchange market will definitely appear in the inland in the future, because no matter how much control there is, some foreign exchange will eventually have to be sold. And as long as the purpose is proper and the use is necessary, foreign exchange can eventually be obtained, but perhaps not as freely and casually as it is now.</p>
<p>Is it not appropriate for a country to make reasonable control over foreign exchange within reasonable limits in order to seek national survival and liberation? And shouldn't the general property class slightly reduce some unnecessary Western enjoyment? Smart friends should be able to think about it calmly, right? Why should the general public worry about the future of the legal tender for no reason?!</p>
<h3 id="e2">World Trends in a Week <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From June 4th to 10th, 1939</p>
<p>This is a heart-shaking week!</p>
<p>The British special envoy has flown to Moscow, and the British King and Queen have arrived in Washington amidst the cheers of hundreds of thousands of people. However, the British government's policy is still doubted by the world, and the invaders are taking the opportunity to do evil even more rampantly. In the West, Germany is "striking first" and its evil hands are reaching into the Baltic coastal countries. In the East, Japan has completed the arrangement for attacking and seizing the Tianjin concessions, and even dares to kill British expatriates in Shanghai!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the depreciation of China's legal tender has shaken people's hearts and even more so the market. Rumors about the attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States are spreading from all sides. However, at this moment, the National Government issued an order to strictly arrest the traitor and traitor Wang Jingwei. It swept away the dark clouds in everyone's mind, it demonstrated the power of the Chinese people's voice and the progress of the entire political system, and it further increased the international prestige of Chinese politics and people!</p>
<p>(1) Strang Flies to Moscow Slowly, The British Government Has Not Abandoned the Policy of Compromise</p>
<p>Last week, it was said that the anti-aggression line of the British, French, and Soviet mutual assistance negotiations, due to the British government's insufficiently resolute and active attitude, had been frustrated again. On the Soviet side, in addition to Foreign Minister Molotov's report on May 31, a reply was proposed to the United Kingdom and France on the second of this month: (1) The agreement shall take effect when any of the three contracting parties of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France is subjected to aggression. (2) The agreement shall take effect when any of the three countries is involved in war due to the protection of Poland, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, Finland, Estonia, or Latvia. (3) The agreement shall be implemented when any of the three countries is invaded for assisting other countries applying for assistance. (4) The contracting parties shall immediately discuss technical and mutual assistance methods for resisting aggression. (5) The actions produced by the negotiations shall be unrelated to the League of Nations. (6) The contracting parties shall fully report their original anti-aggression agreements to each other, and exchange opinions with each other before each acceptance of a new treaty. (7) After the implementation of the three-nation agreement, they shall not separately sign peace treaties with opponents. (8) The term of the agreement shall be five years, but it may be extended. According to reports, the British and French authorities have formulated a new counter-proposal as a result of studying this reply. The British government has appointed Strang, the director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, to fly to Moscow to continue the negotiations. Chamberlain said in a report on the 7th, "The British government will satisfy the Soviet Union's hopes and is prepared to establish an agreement based on a complete mutual relationship, and at the same time clearly express its willingness to unite with France without reservation. Once the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression, it will provide full military assistance." However, when the British Foreign Secretary elaborated on diplomacy in the House of Lords on the 8th, he still tried his best to please Italy and Germany, indicating that Britain had not forgotten the policy of compromise. And Strang also postponed his trip to the Soviet Union. Therefore, some people still suspect the sincerity of the United Kingdom towards the Soviet Union. Churchill of the Conservative Party has risen up and loudly called for it, and the French political circles have also expressed dissatisfaction with this policy of the United Kingdom. (See today's newspaper yesterday)</p>
<p>(2) Invaders Take the Opportunity to Launch Major Activities, Strange News Reflects New Conspiracies</p>
<p>The fascist invaders had already been watching from the sidelines. Seeing this attitude of Britain and the wavering of the French government, they believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so they enticed and flattered on the one hand and sharpened their knives on the other. On the 4th, Hitler delivered a speech, trying his best to defend the policy of aggression and threatening the United Kingdom and France. Germany and Italy separately withdrew some invading troops from Spain, trying their best to entice the United Kingdom and France. Then, under the guise of the Pope's "peace" appeal, it claimed that the Pope had instructed Italy, Germany, France, Poland, Britain, and other countries to contact their governments to convene a five-nation conference to resolve international issues and prevent "Bolshevism from spreading in Europe," and did its best to entice and collude with a small number of reactionary leaders in the United Kingdom and France. At the same time, they also "struck first" and extended their evil hands to the Baltic coastal countries, first seizing Latvia and Estonia, and signing the "Non-Aggression Treaty" between Germany, Estonia, and Latvia in Berlin. The "Non-Aggression Agreement" between Germany and Denmark was also approved by the Danish Parliament on the 2nd. In addition, Germany and Italy also joined forces to attack Yugoslavia. Italy was showing off its military power and deploying war on the southern border, and Germany even invited Prince Paul of the southern country to Berlin, forcing him to recognize the five requirements in an attempt to control the southern country politically, economically, and militarily. At the same time, news came that Germany and Italy were also coveting Bolivia in South America. U.S. Secretary of State Hull and the Bolivian Embassy in the United Kingdom both issued statements on the matter on the 4th. And the news that Germany and Italy were helping the Japanese army to deploy future military work to continue invading China and preparing for the Soviet Union was also published in several newspapers this week.</p>
<p>(3) "Foreign Slave" Cleverly Plays a Two-Faced Game, The United Kingdom, The United States, and France Suffer Three Lashes</p>
<p>Last week's report was not wrong. The Japanese ×× shamefully succumbed to the provocations against the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia. Although it will continue to have the same shameless performance in the future, the main thing is that it will first choose the weak to attack!</p>
<p>At this time of "European chaos," the Japanese invaders of the East are staging a big magic show, imitating the two-faced tactics of Germany and Italy in Europe today. On the one hand, they pretend and act, claiming that they will never participate in the German-Italian military alliance. Then, they promote that "the British-Soviet negotiations have failed, and the British-Japanese alliance is brewing 'revival,'" and even spread rumors that "the United Kingdom and the United States have come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, and the United Kingdom and the United States are forcing China to yield" (this was especially loud when the legal tender depreciated). Anyone who knows a little about the international situation will naturally see at a glance that this is a Japanese ×'s plot to lure the great powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to fall into its ×, to sow discord in the friendship between China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. On the other hand, the Japanese × unexpectedly put on the airs of an evil star. In addition to continuing and intensifying the anti-foreign propaganda, they also specially selected the United Kingdom, one of the weakest links in the anti-aggression line, to carry out a "full martial arts" political and diplomatic offensive. They continued to express their strength and arrogance towards the Gulangyu incident, and tried their best to worsen the situation in Shanghai, even beating to death Dingler, a British employee of the Lun Chang Factory (he was found dead in a bizarre way by the British in the factory on the 8th). In addition, what is even more noteworthy is the breakdown of the negotiations on opening the Pearl River, the detention of Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Foshan ships, and the forced surrender of the British on the Yangtze River issue. What is even more astonishing is that after Spear, the military attache of the British Embassy, was tragically arrested by the Japanese ×, his attendant Cuba was also detained. The preparations for the armed seizure of the Tianjin concessions are also being actively arranged, and the Tianjin concessions have once again fallen into a state of "stormy weather." The United Kingdom, the United States, and France have obviously suffered heavy losses. Allowing negotiations with the Japanese side is the first mistake. Pressuring Shanghai newspapers and anti-Japanese elements, and even delivering the Japanese ×'s peace "conditions" on their behalf, is the second time they have been fooled. Ordering British expatriates to apply for Yangtze River passes from the Japanese military leaders can be said to be the third time they have been beaten.</p>
<p>What is the result of concession and compromise? The "Kokumin Shimbun" in Tokyo published on the 9th: "Japan must expel British forces in the Far East!"</p>
<p>(4) Roosevelt Guarantees Pro-Soviet Policy, The United States Greets the British King Warmly</p>
<p>The friendship between the Soviet Union and the United States, the guardians of world peace and the most loyal and reliable friends on the anti-aggression line, has been improving recently. The new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Oumansky, presented his credentials to the United States on the 3rd of this month and said, "In the current international situation, universal peace and cultural progress have been greatly threatened. Therefore, the enhancement of mutual friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union is even more important. The Soviet Union's foreign policy has the deepest sincerity for world peace." At that time, U.S. President Roosevelt said in his speech, guaranteeing that the United States is determined to maintain and promote the Soviet policy. He said, "The United States is now cooperating with the Soviet Union, and it should develop the friendly relations between the two countries in the future." In addition, the commercial treaty signed between the Soviet Union and Poland was approved by the Soviet government on the 4th. The Soviet fleet's exercise in the Baltic Sea, the U.S. President's all-out advocacy of abolishing the unfair ban on arms exports in the current Neutrality Act, and the U.S. Pacific Fleet's commencement of a large exercise on the 5th, etc., all the news in this week can be seen the efforts of the Soviet Union and the United States in anti-aggression and peace-keeping work. And what is even more sensational in the world is that the British King and Queen's engagement to Canada and the United States arrived in Washington on the afternoon of the 8th, and all the U.S. officials and people sent out a frenzy of cheers. During the grand party in the evening, when the U.S. President raised his glass to wish the British King and Queen health, he said, "The entire United States welcomes distinguished guests. Recently, the settlement of the Pacific islands' affiliation issues between the United Kingdom and the United States has further increased the friendship between the two countries. We hope that this kind of understanding between the two countries will become closer and work together for world peace." The British King also said in his reply, "I hope that the two great countries of the United Kingdom and the United States can move forward side by side in a peaceful world in the future." Yes! If the United Kingdom and the United States work together to resist aggression, world peace will come!</p>
<p>(5) Peeping at Northern Shaanxi and Western Shanxi, A Great Battle, On the Overall Situation, Our Army Has the Advantage</p>
<p>Once the War of Resistance Against Japan came, there were still no major changes.</p>
<p>First of all, in the Central China area, since our army smashed the Japanese ×'s plan to "encircle and annihilate" a large-scale campaign under Dahong Mountain in northern Hubei and southern Henan, the Japanese × fled in embarrassment, retreating four or five hundred li. Our army took advantage of the victory and advanced, gaining control of the Japanese ×'s actions in Central China. At the beginning of the month, the Japanese × turned to southern Hubei, attempting to circle around northern Hunan along the Han River, and coordinate with Henan × to meet in Changsha. However, after the fierce battle in the Han River, the × army lost its offensive power. Now the × in the Han River cannot cross the East Jing River, and our troops on the north bank of the Xinqiang River have been sweeping away the remnants of the × for days, with the momentum of a broken bamboo. Not only have they recovered the original strongholds, but they still maintain the encirclement of Yueyang. The × in northern Jiangxi have been trying to cross the Gan River for days without success. The borders of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi are generally calm. The ×'s plan to open up the entire Yuehan Railway is temporarily impossible to realize.</p>
<p>In the Northwest, the situation has become tense in the past week. The Japanese × are attacking from southern Shanxi and western Shanxi. Regarding southern Shanxi, the × has been dividing its troops into three routes since the 6th, attempting to directly attack Maojiandu, and the war is unprecedentedly fierce. As of the 8th, the telegraph reported that as a result of our army's brave counterattack, it had successively recovered Shengshangjian, Hanjia Village, and other places, and the morale was high, and the situation had improved. Regarding western Shanxi, the × has been transferring more than 10,000 troops from the Taiyuan, Yuci, and Fenyang areas to Zhongyang and Lishi, attempting to cross the Yellow River to the west and invade northern Shaanxi. Thus, the major battle that became the focus of the war this week was staged in western Shanxi. Our army first killed more than 1,000 × in the area south of Jicheng on the 4th of the month. Then, the × changed its strategy and adopted a roundabout encirclement strategy, dividing its troops from Zhongyang and Lishi and encircling them from north and south, attempting to occupy the various crossing points of Kuangkou, Jundu, and Sanjiao, and then cross the river to attack Shaanxi. However, after days of counterattacks and fierce attacks by our army, more than 1,000 × were annihilated, and its momentum was frustrated again. According to the speeches of Commander Wei Lihuang on the 3rd and Commander Yan Xishan on the 5th, it can be seen that the military, government, party, students, and the people in the Northwest are fighting together on the united front. At present, they are able to prevent the × army from attacking, and are also training millions of people and 300,000 iron troops, preparing to drive out the Japanese ×.</p>
<p>Overall, we have indeed gained a comprehensive advantage militarily. At present, the Japanese ×'s combat power has been brought to its peak, and all strongholds are threatened and attacked by us, trying to use our manpower and material resources to supplement themselves. Therefore, we must now intensify the battle behind the × army and carry out the conspiracy to oppose Wang ×, the traitor, "peacefully oppose communism and establish a new central government."</p>
<p>(6) Falling Currency Prices Strike the Traitors, National Law Strictly Arrests Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>Our country's highest authorities are now able to cope with the military situation freely, so they are focusing on training cadres, improving politics, and working hard to build the army and the country.</p>
<p>However, the conspiracy and poisonous schemes of the Japanese × and its running dogs in Jingwei are being intensified, and they are actively operating in politics, diplomacy, and economy. These activities are what we cannot ignore, and we must immediately launch a painful attack on them.</p>
<p>"The fall in the price of the legal tender" is like a bomb that fell on the speculative market. Although people's hearts were once disturbed, everyone now understands that this is not about the credibility of the legal tender itself, nor is it about our country's foreign exchange fund. What is being hit is the Japanese × and the traitor's "financial offensive," only those Chinese ×× who have lost their conscience and fled with funds, and only those fools of the nation who rely on national currency to supply their overseas indulgences. On the contrary, the legal tender itself remains stable, the credit of China and foreign countries remains, foreign exchange control and trade management are easier to implement, and the possibility of inland production事业 gaining double the development is greater!</p>
<p>Just when the legal tender depreciated and the Japanese × traitor Wang was spreading rumors, just when they were using this incident to slander the government's prestige, provoke the feelings of friendly countries, and shake the confidence of compatriots in the war of resistance, with a clap of thunder, our National Government finally issued a clear order to strictly arrest Wang Jingwei, the running dog of the Japanese ×, under the unanimous appeal of the soldiers on the front and compatriots at home and abroad! This clear order swept away the doubts of the people of the whole country about the government's attitude, this clear order consolidated the united front of the whole country's resistance against × and increased the strength of the battles on all fronts, this clear order made clearer the greatness of the Chinese people's power, the sincerity of the Chinese government and in democratic politics, and greatly increased the prestige of the Chinese nation in the world on the anti-aggression line!</p>
<p>However, the Japanese × traitor Wang faction and all the stubborn conservatives who facilitate the × people, all these countercurrents that hinder political and war progress, will still have more cruel and shameless performances in the future. We must, under the leadership of the government, intensify the struggle with them!</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Current State of Higher Education in China (Continued) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Establishing New Schools</p>
<p>Although pre-war colleges and universities experienced stagnation or reorganization due to the impact of the war, the Ministry of Education continued to establish new schools during the Anti-Japanese War to meet the needs of the war effort. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) National Guiyang Medical College: In the summer of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Ministry of Education originally planned to establish the Wuchang Medical College. However, with the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, many existing medical, nursing, and midwifery schools were destroyed or suspended. At the same time, there was an urgent need for medical professionals to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. Therefore, it was decided to establish the Guiyang Medical College in Guiyang to train specialized medical personnel.</p>
<p>(2) Teachers Colleges: Since the establishment of schools at the end of the Qing Dynasty, China had established junior and senior normal schools to train primary and secondary school teachers. After the founding of the Republic, the name "senior normal school" was changed to "higher normal school," which continued to be the place for training secondary school teachers. At that time, the academic atmosphere was pure and simple, and teachers were highly respected. Many graduates had the spirit of serving the cause of education for life. Since the reform of the school system in the 11th year of the Republic (1922), most higher normal schools have been upgraded to universities. As a result, except for the National Peking Normal University, there was no specialized institution for training secondary school teachers in the country. Secondary school teachers generally lacked professional training, and the education of secondary school students became a serious problem. In April of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the National Provisional Congress passed the "Outline of Implementation Plan for Education at All Levels During Wartime." Article 3 stipulated the necessity to cultivate teachers with morality, intelligence and physical education for secondary schools, and to urgently plan for the establishment of such institutions with reference to the previous higher normal school system. Based on actual needs, the Ministry of Education planned to establish teachers colleges in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), initially intending to coordinate the overall situation and establish them in different regions. However, due to the ongoing war, this could not be realized. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily establish one independent teachers college, and to transform the education colleges of National Central University and Northwest Associated University into teachers colleges. The education department of Southwest Associated University and the education department of Yunnan University were merged and reorganized into a teachers college, located within Southwest Associated University. The education departments of Zhejiang University and Sun Yat-sen University, along with their education research institutes, were expanded into teachers colleges to meet current needs. From then on, secondary school teachers would have a unified and well-established training institution. Excellent teachers would emerge in large numbers, and the teaching and training in secondary schools would inevitably improve day by day. This was truly an important measure in higher education during the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>(3) National Central Vocational and Technical College and Various Specialized Courses: Developing the interior and building the rear area were the most important national policies during the Anti-Japanese War. The Ministry of Education specially established the National Vocational and Technical College in Sichuan, offering six departments: papermaking, agricultural product manufacturing, leather, dyeing and weaving, aquaculture, and sericulture. It also established specialized courses in telecommunications, automobiles, mining, machinery, chemical testing, agricultural economics, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, accounting, statistics, hygiene, engineering, and health administration, which were to be affiliated with various universities and colleges. All courses were designed to be completed in two years, in order to cultivate senior specialized technical personnel in various fields and meet the needs of developing the rear area.</p>
<p>(4) National Chongqing Merchant Marine College: Although China's shipbuilding and shipping industries were initiated at the end of the Qing Dynasty, they had not been able to develop much over the decades. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the only school in the country that trained professionals in this field was the Wusong Merchant Marine College. Unfortunately, it was suspended after the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai. With the expansion of China's river and sea navigation scope, it was impossible to ignore shipping education. Based on the recommendations of the Education Committee of the National Defense Supreme Council, the Ministry of Education specially established the National Chongqing Merchant Marine College, recruiting shipbuilding and navigation experts. On the one hand, it enrolled students and provided instruction to train specialized personnel. On the other hand, it conducted research and design to meet needs.</p>
<p>(5) National Veterinary College: The Gan-Qing area has lush pastures, which are most suitable for livestock raising. Developing the Northwest should promote livestock husbandry to increase production. Although many local residents are engaged in this, the livestock industry has not developed because too many animals die from disease, and there is no way to prevent or control it. The Ministry of Education is now formulating measures to establish the college as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(6) University Preparatory Courses: Since the start of the war, colleges and universities have moved to the interior one after another. Secondary schools have also been affected by the war and cannot maintain their classes as usual. Most young students have moved to different places and cannot concentrate on their studies. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), when the Ministry of Education organized unified national enrollment for all national colleges and universities, more than 11,000 students applied in various regions. Although more than 5,400 were admitted, their overall performance did not fully meet the standards. The performance of those who were not admitted was even worse. In order to remedy students' academic performance and improve the level of universities, the Ministry of Education took supplementary measures, ordering all colleges and universities to supervise and urge newly admitted students to receive remedial instruction. On the other hand, it established university preparatory classes to recruit high school graduates who aspired to study at the university level but had not been admitted, providing them with preparatory training for university education, so that they could take the entrance examinations for various universities and colleges in the 28th year of the Republic (1939). These preparatory classes have already been established by the Ministry in various parts of Sichuan Province. The student enrollment quota was set at 400, and enrollment and classes have begun in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Guiyang. In addition, Yunnan University and Northwest Associated University each enrolled 50 preparatory class students. The duration of study was from January to August of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Because there were still many out-of-school students in the Shaanxi area, Northwest Associated University was ordered to add one class, and Guangxi University was ordered to establish one affiliated class, in order to provide relief. In total, 12 preparatory classes were established, which could accommodate 600 out-of-school students.</p>
<p>(7) Other Vocational Schools: In addition, the vocational schools established by various provinces that have been approved by the Ministry of Education include the Jiangsu Provincial Bank Vocational School, the Fujian Provincial Medical Vocational School, the Jiangxi Provincial Veterinary Vocational School, and the Shaanxi Provincial Medical Vocational School. All of these are new measures to promote vocational education. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Financial Authorities Issue Statement: Policy of Maintaining Legal Tender Has Never Changed; Adjusting Market Prices Benefits Our Country's Economy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] Regarding recent fluctuations in foreign exchange market prices, reporters inquired with the Ministry of Finance. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry, the following statements were made: (1) Maintaining legal tender is the established policy of our government. The methods used by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee to adjust foreign exchange market prices recently have neither changed the government's policy nor have they been taken without the approval of the government. (2) Due to seasonal import and export relationships, imports are currently increasing, especially the import of non-essential goods. Therefore, adjusting foreign exchange market prices to meet standards that are beneficial to our economy and maintain the balance of international payments will further consolidate the foreign exchange market situation. (3) The government's policy of maintaining the legal value of legal tender has remained consistent before and after the war. Since the management of foreign exchange began, public and private institutions with legitimate needs for foreign exchange, after approval by the Ministry of Finance, have been sold foreign exchange by the Central Bank at the legal value. This is a well-known fact. As for the difference between market prices and legal values, this phenomenon is not unique to our country after the management of foreign exchange. (4) The government has repeatedly ordered banks to maintain market stability in order to reduce market fluctuations, with good results. After the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, the institutions handling the matter are even more perfect in maintaining strength, which is particularly evident. (5) Recently, the government has made greater efforts to reduce the import of non-essential goods and has taken various measures to encourage exports, while also saving on the use of foreign exchange, in the hope of benefiting our country's economy and adapting to the needs of the war of resistance. The strength of the Stabilization Fund Management Committee is also sufficient to stabilize the market situation. We firmly believe that all parties' confidence in the legal tender will be further enhanced and will not be affected by current market fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Important Strongholds Are All in Our Hands; Fierce Fighting in Southwestern Shanxi Province <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 10th] Telegram from Yuanqu: The fighting in southwestern Shanxi is still fierce. As of the 9th, both sides were fiercely contesting the areas near Liulin, Qikou, and Sanjiao. All important strongholds are in our hands. The ratio of casualties is much higher for the enemy than for us, which can be called a great victory. The enemy, advancing on Pinglu, has been killed by us in the hundreds over the past three days. The enemy, attacking south of Jie County, was intercepted by us north of Monan Town, suffering heavy casualties. Although the enemy has been reinforcing and attacking continuously in various places, judging from their strength, their attempt will be difficult to achieve. One of our units attacked Yicheng at the beginning of the month, annihilating nearly a hundred enemies.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 10th] Telegram from Luoyang: Along the Pinghan Railway, the enemy is rushing to build fortifications day and night to defend against attacks by our guerrillas. However, our troops are lurking everywhere, continuously cutting off transportation.</p>
<p>[Yuanqu, Central News Agency, 10th] The enemy is continuing to attack eastward. On the 9th, 500 enemy troops occupied Panan Village (west of Maojin) and built fortifications, attempting to join up with enemy troops fleeing south from Zhangdian to attack Maojin Ferry. One of our units has met them head-on and is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. The two strongholds of Shengrenjian and Liyao Village, directly north of Maojin, are still in our hands. On the afternoon of the 9th, 200-300 enemy troops from Dachen Village once harassed us but were repelled. One of our units has moved to the rear of the enemy, in the area north and south of Guocun and Lv Village, to thoroughly wipe out the enemy. On the 10th, more than 1,300 enemy troops were surrounded and defeated by us at Buan Ferry, with many enemy troops killed and a large number of military supplies captured.</p>
<p>[Fancheng, Central News Agency, 10th] Due to our continuous attacks, the enemy in Qianjiang has mostly withdrawn from the city and is deploying defenses on the east bank of the Dongjing River. Civilian houses have been opened up by the enemy, and our civilians are not allowed to enter. A few enemy cavalry are active near Gangjiang from time to time.</p>
<p>[Foreign News from This Port] A Shanghai telegram reports that Jinan was suddenly placed under martial law yesterday (the 10th). Several hundred Japanese soldiers left the city to reinforce the suburbs, because it was reported beforehand that Chinese guerrillas had completely annihilated several Japanese troops about ten miles from the city and were advancing towards Jinan. It is reported that Japanese troops and guerrillas made contact last night.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Battlefield on the Border of Henan and Hubei Provinces: On-the-Spot Inspection; A Magnificent Historical Trace Left in Remote Areas; Iron Cavalry Reports Arriving Amidst Ruins and Walls <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Fancheng, Central News Agency, 9th] After the defeat of the enemy on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces, a reporter immediately went to inspect the area. However, because the roads were completely destroyed and the civilian donkeys and horses had been seized by the enemy, the reporter traveled on foot, reaching the destination after two weeks. Wherever the enemy's iron cavalry went, the cities and villages were mostly burned. This was especially the case in Zaoyang and Lishan. The houses were reduced to rubble, which is not sufficient to describe the tragic situation.</p>
<p>Forty... two strong... can be heard everywhere. In almost every village, our strong men were bayoneted or shot by the enemy. All of this is sufficient proof of the enemy's brutality and the inviolability of our national spirit. The people of the border area of Henan and Hubei provinces enthusiastically assisted the army in combat this time. It is unnecessary to mention that the people brought their own food to destroy the roads and transport bullets. What is most touching is that the people took in the wounded soldiers. An old woman living alone in Nanguo, Xinye, whose arm was injured by enemy artillery, insisted on taking in the wounded soldiers. When asked, she said, "I live and eat in this village. The soldiers protect my homes and land. How can I not take them in?" Xu Buchen, the magistrate of Xinye County, personally led the self-defense team to resist when the enemy invaded, blocking the enemy's advance for two days, which eventually allowed our main force to arrive and annihilate most of the enemy. This point is also commendable. The general public was able to thoroughly implement the National Covenant. For example, the people of Xinye did not guide the enemy, nor did they seek food for the enemy, which became a widespread phenomenon. After entering, the enemy was like stepping into a field of thorns and could not extricate themselves. Order has been restored in the recovered counties. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Ministry of Military Affairs to allocate 10,000 yuan to relieve the affected compatriots in Zaoyang. Other counties have also distributed accumulated grain and implemented emergency relief measures, so the local situation is showing a good outlook.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Defense of Chao-Shan Is Completed <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Chao'an, Central News Agency, 8th] A Central News Agency reporter, having traversed the damaged railway on foot, recently arrived in a certain place and transferred to Chaozhou for inspection. Along the way, the reporter witnessed women, children, the old and the weak being evacuated from Shantou, with soldiers and civilians assisting in the construction of fortifications in a busy manner. The atmosphere was full of wartime spirit. After arriving in Chaozhou, the reporter visited the military and political leaders. Based on the judgment of the enemy's situation and the anti-Japanese defense forces in Chaozhou and Shantou, the reporter inquired of Commander Xu, who expressed his determination to defend Chaozhou and Shantou with a firm tone. He said that the defense deployment had been completed, the military and political connections were very strong, and the enemy air force's movements in the Linghai area in recent days were a test of their attempts to invade, and they were on high alert. If the enemy comes, they will be met head-on. He also said that the political and military sectors have established a unified command mechanism with interconnectedness, and that he is working hard to make politics catch up with military affairs, which is gradually becoming effective. Regarding the Chaozhou and Shantou teams, he is determined to thoroughly reorganize them in terms of quality and quantity, and will deploy coastal strongholds step by step to ensure that the enemy who lands will eventually be trapped in the mud and be painfully annihilated.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shanghai] According to reliable sources, Wang Ni arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month. On the third day after arriving in Shanghai, he secretly invited six of his confidants for a half-hour conversation. However, before the conversation ended, Wang suddenly left his seat and entered the back hall. The six confidants sat upright and waited. After more than a quarter of an hour, a male servant came out from the back hall and notified the six that Wang had left the place and asked them to inform everyone that they would make an appointment again on another day. As for the location where the six met, it is said to be in a certain building on the Shanghai section of the extraterritorial road in the southern part of Suzhou River, and there was no slightest security there.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Roosevelt's Eloquence Is Unmatched <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the raging flames of war, the leaders of Britain and the United States met hand in hand. When President Roosevelt raised his glass to bless the King of England, he specifically said the following words:</p>
<p>"The negotiations between Britain and the United States regarding the ownership of the two islands in the Pacific have resulted in an agreement to use them jointly, which has been successfully resolved. We hope that this understanding between Britain and the United States will become closer and closer, and that the friendship between the two countries will become more and more cordial."</p>
<p>Roosevelt is truly a wonderful person in the international political world. He did not say it too early or too late, but used these words in the middle of this grand meeting between the British and American leaders, which is really worth noting. Because it not only hits the nail on the head regarding the close cooperation between Britain and the United States, but also correctly points out the focus of future international issues.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that Britain and the United States will obtain further cooperation in Pacific issues. We also hope that the general public will pay more attention to the future of the Pacific. China since the Anti-Japanese War has become an important player in the Pacific. We must intensify the struggle for liberation, and we must be the cornerstone of a stable and truly peaceful order in the Pacific!</p>
<h3 id="e13">Young Men of Nanyue Enlist Enthusiastically; Farmers of Daxing County Bravely Kill the Enemy <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Nanyue, Central News Agency, 9th] The local customs of this town are said to be simple and unsophisticated. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, enlistment has been quite enthusiastic. Among them, there is a man named Dongchu from Guangdong. His two sons, the elder son Wanxiong, is 25 years old. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred the year before last, he stopped the wedding and enlisted in the army first. He was assigned to the XX Division and is still fighting bloody battles on the front lines. The younger son Yun, who is 16 years old this year and graduated from elementary school, was motivated by patriotic thoughts and went directly to the town office to enlist, and was transferred to the county government and assigned to the military, waiting to depart. Their father, Dongchu, and mother, Wen, were extremely excited that both of their sons could serve the country, and they took care of family affairs themselves. There are also three daughters in the family, two of whom are young, and the eldest daughter, who is 22 years old, seeing her brothers joining the army one after another, also decided to go to the front line to take on rescue work. The other day, neighbors and villagers gave them settling-in money and set off firecrackers to send them off. Kuang Jun believed that it was his duty to serve the country and firmly declined to accept the gifts. The spirit of loyalty and righteousness is concentrated in one family, which truly adds a lot of color to the famous mountain. Now, people from all walks of life in the town are jointly petitioning the government to give them a special commendation to inspire and motivate others.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 9th] Telegram from Tianjin: Because the guerrillas in various counties are active, the enemy recently issued an order ordering farmers to cut down all unripe wheat. As a result, farmers in various counties united to resist. Another telegram: The farmers in Daxing County, Hebei, attacked the county seat and killed the head of the puppet county government and the assistant officials sent by the enemy.</p>

<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] News from Tokyo: The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have decided to blockade the British and French concessions in Tianjin. However, before implementing the blockade, the Japanese will issue a statement explaining that Japan has to blockade for self-defense, regardless of any difficulties. The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have also issued instructions to all Japanese overseas Chinese, asking everyone to work closely with the Japanese authorities to ensure the success of the new plan. The blockade order will be implemented around the 14th or 15th of this month. At that time, all those entering the Chinese or Japanese concessions from the British and French concessions will be inspected, and overseas Chinese and foreigners will be treated equally. The reason why the blockade order must be delayed until that time is that the goods of Japanese shipping companies and Osaka Shosen Company must be completely moved by the 14th.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] News from Tianjin: Because Japan will soon begin free action against the British concession, the Japanese consulate in Tianjin is now asking the consulates of France, the United States, Germany, and Italy for understanding, and the French consul has telegraphed his country about the seriousness of the situation in Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] External News from Tianjin: The British Overseas Chinese Association is scheduled to hold a general membership meeting tonight to discuss the issues raised by the Japanese. The Japanese are demanding that four Chinese people related to the Cheng Xigeng case be handed over. Otherwise, the Japanese will take retaliatory action. According to Reuters, quoting authoritative Japanese sources, the so-called retaliatory action by the Japanese will probably take the form of special treatment, such as the roads connecting the British concession to the outside world will be completely closed to traffic, and the activities of British overseas Chinese and the movement of British merchants' goods will be restricted, with only the import of food being unaffected. If this move is implemented, all residents in the concession will inevitably feel serious inconvenience. As for the French concession, due to historical traditions, it is feared that it will also inevitably suffer the same restrictions as the British concession.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The Ambassador to Tokyo, Craigie, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on Saturday morning and met for one hour. It is reported that the content of the conversation concerned the Japanese demand for the handover of terrorists in the Tianjin concession, as well as the British government's protest against the detention of British Embassy military attache Sipinlie by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Sipinlie Is Still Detained <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Lieutenant Cobo, an interpreter at the British Embassy in China, was released only on Saturday after going to Zhangjiakou to investigate the detention of military attache Sipinlie. However, Sipinlie has not yet regained his freedom and must wait for the Japanese side to review the matter.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] The tense situation between Britain and Japan has not eased to date. The British government plans to submit a memorandum to Japan in the short term, rejecting Japan's demand to control the public concessions in China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 10th] Two famous Chinese bankers in this area were arrested by the police of the Public Concession. This matter was instigated by the Japanese authorities, who strongly claimed that one of the bankers was a military officer and the other was the leader of the Shanghai guerrilla team. Both men work for the Chinese-owned Far East Bank, one as a manager and the other as a director. Both are currently detained by the Public Concession police station, awaiting the Japanese to present evidence.</p>

<p>[Continental News Agency, Guilin Aviation News] In order to strengthen the long-term war of resistance, the National Government is working hard to develop the production business in the interior. It recently decided to allocate 10 million yuan for the development of production business in Guangxi, Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Jiangxi provinces. The plans promoted by the Farmers Bank in promoting agricultural production have achieved remarkable results, and agricultural cooperatives have been established in all provinces. The industrial cooperation movement led by the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association is also being promoted rapidly in all provinces. The Bank of China has decided to lend 6 million yuan to the Gansu Provincial Government for the development of handicrafts production cooperatives and general commerce in Gansu Province. After the establishment of the Industrial Cooperative Association, more than 200 cooperatives have been established in the Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and Sichuan-Kang areas, with more than 1.5 million yuan in funds loaned out. In addition to the 5 million yuan previously allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the association's foundation, it has now negotiated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allocate another 2.5 million yuan to meet the needs of continued development.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Foreign Reporter's Report: The Current Situation in the Guerrilla Areas of North China (Part 1) <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Our Guerrilla Strongholds are Scattered Like Stars, Growing and Growing, Leaving No Way to Deal With It</p>
<p>[Shanghai North-China Daily News, Beijing Correspondence] Many people in Chinese towns and cities whose real homes and families are in inland villages must now have lost contact with their families. This is because North China has been clearly divided into two regions, with absolutely no communication between them. On one side are the towns and cities occupied by the Japanese army and the small surrounding rural areas connected by narrow railways. On the other side is the vast inland area, mostly untouched by the invaders and still under Chinese control. Nowadays, the Japanese authorities are always displeased with those who want to go inland, and it is not easy to make the trip. This is because the two regions are separated by a "no man's land," continuously consisting of burned or destroyed villages, unrestrained by either side, with guerrilla forces lingering in between. Therefore, the situation in the inland areas is now very difficult to ascertain. We can only learn a little from the occasional missionaries living inland, or from the few Chinese intellectuals who manage to sneak back into the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Various Places in North China</p>
<p>The current situation in the areas of North China (northeast of the Yellow River) controlled by the Chinese and Japanese sides is summarized as follows: (1) Inner Mongolia: Mostly under Japanese control, but the Japanese have not planned for proper garrisoning. (2) Suiyuan: The railway and the cities and towns along the route, and the narrow strips of land, are all in the hands of the Japanese army. However, the countryside south of the railway line, and the vast area west of Baotou, the terminal station of the line, are still held by the Chinese army. (3) Chahar: The northern area outside the Great Wall and the narrow strip of land along the Pingzhang Railway are under Japanese control. (4) Shanxi: After three long and arduous attempts to expel the guerrillas, the central plateau, the western and southern parts of Taiyuan, and the narrow strip of land along the narrow-gauge Datong-Puzhou Railway to the Yellow River are now in the hands of the Japanese army. The rest of the province is still under Chinese control. (5) Hebei: The eastern part (i.e., what is called Eastern Hebei). The area between the Beining Railway and the Great Wall is still relatively peaceful (remember that before July 1937, this area was already in the hands of the Japanese army). In the central part, the Japanese army claims to have "suppressed" the guerrillas as far as halfway to the Yellow River. (6) Shandong: The area connecting the two railways, and the area north of the Yellow River, is still relatively peaceful. However, the mountainous areas and straits in the central part of the province are still in the hands of the Chinese army. Even in the areas along the railway where Japanese troops are stationed, the situation is often unstable.</p>
<p>Along the Railway Lines</p>
<p>Many important railway lines are far from being tranquil, and the railway lines that penetrate into the interior can only be used for military purposes. The Pinghan Line has been repeatedly attacked and destroyed, as has the Pingsui Line between Zhangjiakou and Suiyuan. The damage to the Pingsui Line is so severe that trains have not been running for several weeks. The Datong coal mine on the Pingsui Line in northern Shanxi has been damaged in recent weeks and cannot operate, as is the Liji coal mine in the western mountains not far from Beijing. There have been frequent reports of train damage, resulting in a shortage of trains, which are even insufficient to cope with the greatly reduced passenger and freight traffic in these areas. It is no wonder that the Japanese have been unable to carry out economic development after occupying North China for nearly two years. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e20">The Gold Rush at Wangjiang Tower <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Yufei</p>
<p>[Chengdu Airmail] Sichuan is the ancient Shu Kingdom. Protected by mountains and rivers, it has always been ruled by feudal forces. Therefore, historical sites and strange tales are more numerous than in other provinces. However, the only thing related to the current war of resistance is the "gold rush" on the Jinjiang River outside the east gate of Chengdu.</p>
<p>The famous historical site outside the east gate of the city is "Wangjiang Tower." Wangjiang Tower is the former residence of the Tang Dynasty courtesan Xue Tao, with historical sites such as "Pipa Gate Alley," "Xue Tao Well," and "Floating Cup Pond." All year round, tourists fill the road, so the Chengdu Municipal Government has opened it as a suburban park. In recent months, someone suddenly said that there was a great treasure of silver buried here, and a company had been organized to excavate it, causing a sensation among the people of Sichuan and spreading news throughout the country. Those who cared rushed to inquire. The reporter has been to the site several times, but because the matter was too vague and no discoveries had been made for several months, the reporter has been waiting for the matter to develop. Now that more and more people are concerned, I will make a general report.</p>
<p>Zhang Xianzhong's hatred of using Sichuan people is a rare event in history, ancient and modern. When he held military power, he massacred three-quarters of the people of Sichuan. Later, when he was defeated by Yang Zhanhua, he buried all the gold and silver of Sichuan in the Jinjiang River. When Ding Wen-cheng was governor of Sichuan, someone tried to excavate, but the site was in Jiangkou, Pengshan, and nothing was found. When the War of Resistance had been going on for a year and a half, and the whole country was enthusiastically donating money and conducting charity sales, an old man named Yang from Shuangliu was willing to use his intelligence to serve the country under total mobilization. He said that the place where Zhang Xianzhong hid the silver was on the Jinjiang River near Wangjiang Tower. At first, people thought he was crazy. Old man Yang sighed that no one could recognize the "Jade of Bian He." Driven by patriotism, old man Yang told people everywhere, hoping to realize the gold rush and supplement the economy of the War of Resistance. The matter was known to Ma Shiweikunshan, a former Sichuan army officer, who gathered comrades and organized the "Jinjiang Gold Dredging Company," requesting the Executive Yuan to be in charge of the gold mining project. The Executive Yuan approved it and appointed Ma as a special commissioner to be responsible for handling it. Thus, there is now the news of the gold rush that has caused a sensation throughout the country.</p>
<p>According to old man Yang, his ancestors were subordinates of Zhang Xianzhong and participated in the silver burying work, but were killed by Zhang. When his ancestors died, they left a will saying that the gold was buried in a certain place and could be passed down from generation to generation. Old man Yang's grandfather was in the Qing Dynasty government and had checked the files and found no clues. Yang spent more than twenty years collecting facts and is now over seventy years old. He said that if the excavation is unsuccessful, he is willing to gouge out his eyes and die for it. His firm belief is evident.</p>
<p>According to the "Shu Bi" record, when Zhang Xianzhong entered Sichuan, he forbade people from hiding silver privately. Those who did not obey the order to hand it over would be killed. Later, when Zhang Xianzhong arrived in Chengdu, the people, upon hearing the order, abandoned the silver they had hidden at home in the streets at night. Zhang ordered people to collect it and bury it near the city, and then killed all the silver buriers to prevent others from knowing. Therefore, we know that there were many silver buriers, but no one knew where they were buried. According to old man Yang, the amount was 76 million taels. At 1.4 yuan per tael of legal tender, that is 106.4 million yuan of legal tender. According to the 50% reserve ratio, 212.8 million yuan of legal tender can be issued. In today's war of resistance, the amount is quite considerable.</p>
<p>Jinjiang Gold Dredging Co., Ltd. is a private organization. 80% of the gold mined is donated to the country, and the rest is retained for excavation wages. According to the person in charge of the company, on February 27th of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the provincial government approved the appointment of Ma Shizushan Yang Bailu as a special commissioner for gold dredging, ordering him to start work immediately and submit an engineering plan for record. On March 1st, Special Commissioner Yang and others gathered the company's colleagues to plan the start of work. First, a board of directors was established, with Yang Bailu, Ma Kunshan, Wu Yihou, Luo Zunan, Zhang Xiehua, Xin Shufeng, Fan Kongjia, Li Chongshu, and Wen Chao as directors. Later, Yang Bailu and Ma Kunshan were elected as chairmen, and then the board of directors elected Ma Kunshan as general manager. An engineering office was set up in the first park in the suburbs, and 96 workers were recruited. The method of dredging began in the middle of the river near Wangjiang Tower. Ten zhang long and one zhang wide, this is the first step in the experiment. After five days, about ten zhang were dug, and the water intrusion was very large. Four earth method dragon bone carts were used for drainage work. On the 7th, 8th, and 9th, another hundred workers were added to dig down. When it reached a depth of one zhang and eight feet, it was purely gravel, with no abnormalities. At the same time, the water intrusion became greater, and the four dragon bone carts were not enough to solve the problem. The chairman of the board of directors saw that the project was stalled and was very anxious, and feared that the spring floods would start, abandoning his previous efforts before reaching his goal. A gasoline water suction machine was set up. On the 12th, it was dug in from the right side of the sand pile. At a depth of four feet from the water surface, countless dry bones and four human-shaped bones were found. Each was separated by a foot or so, proving that they were not washed down by the river. According to archaeologists, they were dry bones from within one or two hundred years, and the public believed that they were gold-burying engineering people killed by Zhang Xianzhong. Another layer of blood-soaked sand and gravel was dug down, about five or six feet thick, with a fairly wide area. After research by many experts, this kind of sand and gravel was indeed soaked in human blood, as evidenced by Ren Shou Chen Shaoxiang's "Juan Bi Jin" record, "After Zhang Xianzhong was defeated by Yang Zhan in Jiangkou, he decided to go to northern Sichuan, casting the gold and silver ingots and Yao treasures obtained from the Shu government, and using the law to move the Jinjiang River, drying up its flow, digging holes several ren deep, and filling them with wood and stones to cover them. All the chiselers were killed on top of them." Also, Shen Xunwei's "Shu Nan Xu Lue" says, "He gathered more than a thousand people to transport the gold and silver to the river bank, which took three months. Like building a river break, a small drought was created, and a large hole was made at the bottom of the river, into which gold and silver were thrown, and the transporters were killed on top of them, and then covered with soil, and the river flow was restored to its old course." According to the above two statements, it is sufficient to prove that the blood-soaked sand and gravel layer is the blood of the chiselers and transporters killed by the bandit Xianzhong. The company's colleagues, based on the above two signs, believed that there must be stone bars under the blood-stained sand and gravel layer. On the afternoon of the 13th, several red stone bars were dug up under the blood-stained sand and gravel layer and the decayed human bones layer, about two feet deep, arranged horizontally across the river. The joints between the front, back, left, and right were all covered with tung oil and lime. After washing with water, the word "Zhang" was engraved on one stone. Digging along the stone, stone bars appeared one after another, arranged along the shore, quite like artificial buildings. After four days, a total of ninety-two stone bars were excavated, many of which had engraved characters, such as "Tian" (Heaven), "Si" (Office), "Shang" (Up), "Xia" (Down), "Liang" (Two), etc., the meaning of which is unknown. The words "Dong Zheng" (East Zheng) were dug up on the east side, and the word "Bei" (North) was dug up on the north side. However, the words "Xi" (West) and "Nan" (South) have not yet been dug up. Based on this, the public believes that Zhang Xianzhong's hidden silver originally had boundaries. There is a character "(一)" (one), the meaning of which is unknown to the public. Some older scholars say that "(一)" may be Zhang Xianzhong's killing symbol on the Seven Kill Stele? According to "Shu Gui Jian," "Bandit Xian gathered the students, each with a silver yuan ingot on their head, entering from the west and exiting from the east, killing one student and taking one silver ingot. Answering, 'Are you selling your head?' The one who kills you is still me. Bandit Xian slaughtered the people of Sichuan, playing as if they were little kids." Is "(一)" this circle a silver ingot, and the circle in the middle is a killing knife? The so-called killing symbol is understood here. On the 18th and 21st, stone bars were taken one after another. About two feet below the stone bars, a layer of tung oil, lime, and sand and gravel was found. After the three-combination layer was removed, countless decayed black woods were found. At 11 p.m. on April 8th, a white light suddenly appeared around the project, resembling moonlight, which lasted for about ten minutes before disappearing. Supervisor Xie Guangqian was surprised when he first saw it and woke up the driver Li Zhongyi. They looked at each other in surprise. Four water car workers also saw the white light. The public thought that there was no moon in the sky, so where did the moonlight come from? The light was a large ring shape, with no light outside the ring. Knowing that it was a strange thing, they asked archaeologists. According to them, "A fine gold contains treasure light, which sometimes burns outward; where there is a silver cellar, there must be a white light of the same color." Before the light appeared, a sound of riverbank collapse was heard at the digging site. The water car workers were frightened. When they looked at it with a light, there was nothing. When they dug two zhang deeper, the water color was yellow and black, with a strange smell similar to that of a rotten corpse. A stone ox was found on the right corner, lying down, its head facing northeast. The ox weighed several thousand catties, and its sleeping shape was not knocked over by the water. The public suspected it had a function. According to a Sichuan proverb, "Stone ox faces stone drum, silver is 150,000 taels; if someone can break it, they can buy the entire Chengdu mansion." Does it refer to this? The public was delighted and dug in the direction pointed by the ox's head. A stone was indeed obtained; it was different from the others, half round and half square, with the stone's surface convex on the left and right and concave in the middle. There was only this one stone there. There were no other stones. The public believes that Zhang Xianzhong's thinking was bizarre and strange, or he had other intentions? On May 2nd, more than seventy stone bars were dug out behind the stone ox. There are still characters and the "(一)" symbol. Under the stone bars, countless rotten woods are laid flat, and under the woods are many "Da Shun Yi Xiao Qian" coins cast by bandit Xian.</p>
<p>The gold mining project is now here. According to the person in charge, we will continue to work hard to excavate in the future, and have hired radio expert Xu Weili to rush to make a gold detecting instrument. After the test, a bell-like sensation was felt below. Xu said that there were indeed metal objects buried below. But whether it is silver? And how much is it? And how deep is the block buried? It is still not very certain? The company also hired Zhang Zhonghua and Jin Xiang, two metallographers, to study and manufacture instruments to detect. It is said that since the start of mining, more than 10,000 yuan in wages have been spent. However, the people of the company are still working hard with a spirit of perseverance and determination, and will definitely dig out the gold to strengthen the economy of the Anti-Japanese War. This is the first report of the gold rush at Wangjiang Tower.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Reuters diplomatic correspondent understands that today's British Cabinet meeting discussed the reply to the recent Soviet note. The British Ambassador to France, Sir Eric Phipps, and the Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, Sir William Strang, were present. It is understood that Strang will not be able to depart before the 12th of this month, as he must first examine a large number of documents before he can leave. Also, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Seeds, has recently suffered from influenza and must wait until he recovers before negotiations can proceed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 9th] The French Foreign Minister, Georges Bonnet, gave a lengthy foreign policy report to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee today, giving a detailed account of the progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. Although he acknowledged that some difficulties had arisen in the negotiations, he expressed confidence that these difficulties were not a major obstacle to the future of the negotiations and believed that the future was optimistic and that the negotiations could eventually be completed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech in Birmingham yesterday that we are still prepared to hold meetings to discuss the demands of Germany and any other country, but this is subject to one condition, that we must be confident that the negotiations will result in a satisfactory solution and will not resort to force. This has also been made clear by Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House of Lords. He also mentioned that Britain will hold a general election, but the exact date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Plymouth, 10th] Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech in Birmingham yesterday that Britain had become a militarily powerful country almost overnight, and that in a few days, Britain would have 550,000 armed people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] The speeches of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax inviting Germany and Italy not to expand their armaments and to jointly participate in a meeting to discuss their demands for colonial raw material distribution have been supported by the French government in a tacit manner. Foreign Minister Bonnet said in the Senate yesterday that France is determined to make the encirclement of the status quo faction around the dictators even tighter than before, because the French government firmly believes that the tripartite agreement and the mutual security treaty are the most effective tools for European peace.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] The House of Commons held a debate on the budget of the Ministry of Commerce today, and discussed the commercial relations between Britain and the Eastern European countries and the Balkan countries. The British-German commercial relations were also discussed. The Minister of Commerce, Stanley, gave a lengthy report. He said that the negotiations between German industrialists and the British Industrial Federation were held shortly before Germany annexed Bohemia and Moravia and have now been suspended. If negotiations are to be reopened, both sides must restore mutual confidence, as this is necessary to resume negotiations. Finally, Stanley called on the British people to develop commerce in accordance with the principle of "business as usual" and not to think that an inevitable war is about to break out.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The newspapers here attach great importance to the speech made by Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House of Lords. The Times said that if the spirit of the speech is echoed by Germany, the relationship will be very important. If Germany still responds with ridicule and abuse, then Britain's attitude has also been fully expressed in this speech. If Germany can understand Britain's intentions and ease its actions, then it is hoped that the differences and barriers between European countries will gradually disappear as a result. The News Chronicle expressed that the speech was feared to be misunderstood as a sign of weakness in British policy and a return to the policy of appeasement. If foreign countries misunderstand this, then Britain's position will be even more dangerous. The newspaper went on to discuss Germany's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia, saying that ending such acts of annexation is a prerequisite for negotiations. While foreign countries have not accepted this proposition, Britain should continue to expand its military and form a peace front.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] The Daily Mail commented on Saturday and Sunday, praising the speeches of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, talking about foreign policy, saying that they are prepared to consult with Germany for understanding. The newspaper also advocated taking into account Germany's economic needs, saying that Germany's prosperity would benefit the whole world, and supported the reform of the administrative system of the Suez Canal, because Italy's rights should be equal to those of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] Political and newspaper circles here express extreme distrust of the speeches made by British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Prime Minister Chamberlain on Thursday of this week, saying that these speeches were issued because of the twists and turns in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. German political circles declared, "If Britain is willing to recognize Germany's position in the world, then the most obvious expression of this is to return Germany's old colonies, as these colonies were taken from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles."</p>
<h3 id="e22">Turkey is Active in the Anti-Aggression Camp - Franco-Turkish Declaration Could be Issued Next Week - Anglo-Turkish Military Negotiations are Actively Underway <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Turkish Capital, 9th] According to well-informed sources here, the Franco-Turkish negotiations have actually reached the final stage. The Turkish Foreign Minister met with the French Ambassador to Turkey on Thursday and talked for a long time. It is believed that the content of the discussion was about the Franco-Turkish joint declaration to be issued next week.

<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 9th] At today's meeting of the League of Nations Opium Committee, the Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, strongly requested that the report to be submitted by the committee to the League of Nations General Assembly must include the situation of Japan forcibly poisoning the population in the occupied areas of China. Mr. Hu said that Japan was deliberately seeking to poison the people of the occupied areas in order to increase tax revenue and reduce the Chinese people's resistance to war. Foreign neutral observers have fully confirmed this point. The Yugoslav representative, Jelić, strongly opposed this, but most of the committee members believed that it was inconvenient to refuse Mr. Hu's request. Several members spoke up, strongly criticizing Mr. Jelić's attitude.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 9th] The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee has been discussing drug trafficking in the Far East for three weeks and is nearing completion. It entrusted the Yugoslav representative, Jelić, to draft a report, but he insisted on refusing to include in the report the points made by the Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, accusing Japan of poisoning China for political purposes. The Chinese representative therefore protested. The Advisory Committee discussed the matter today for two hours and finally decided, with the approval of most of the national representatives, to comply with the Chinese representative's request and use the accusations against Japan as material for the report. inform Bonnet that the French Foreign Minister's speech focused on the Franco-Polish agreement, saying that the conclusion of the agreement was a natural move, and mentioned Britain's participation in the agreement, saying that he was very pleased that Britain had concluded a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, as this was the greatest assistance to France and Poland.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, French Morocco, 9th] The authorities issued an order today stipulating that from the 20th of this month, all goods shipped from Japan must be accompanied by a special certificate signed by the Commercial Counselor of the French Embassy in Japan or the French Consul, and must still be countersigned by the Japanese authorities before they can be allowed to be imported. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has strictly managed foreign exchange, and France's trade with Japan has changed from a trade surplus to a trade deficit. The French government has therefore implemented a consular visa system to remedy this.</p>

<p>Imprisoned in Soviet Union for 18 Months - Sees the Light of Day Today</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 9th] The case of the American woman, Mrs. Rubens, who was arrested by the Soviet authorities in December 1937 for entering the Soviet Union illegally, was heard today. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, but the period of detention can be used to offset the period of imprisonment, so she can be released today. The Chief Justice, Vyshinsky, asked the defendant if she had anything to say. Mrs. Rubens replied, "I have nothing else to say, but I want to know how my husband is doing." The judge said that he would be informed later. The trial of the case lasted less than an hour, without formal procedures or the summoning of notaries. Mrs. Rubens, dressed fashionably, sat alone in the front row of the courtroom, smoking a Soviet cigarette.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 10th] Yesterday, the Chief of Staff of the Nazi Brown Shirts, Lutze, flew to this city. Among those welcoming him at the airport were Danzig Senate President Greiser and Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster. After disembarking, Lutze reviewed the police honor guard, the Danzig Brown Shirts, and a delegation of workers. Last night, they gathered at Langer Markt Square for a large parade featuring 6,000 Brown Shirts from East Prussia and 2,000 from Danzig. Because the Prussian Brown Shirts had to pass through the Polish border by train to reach Danzig, some traveled by ship, while others switched to automobiles. Furthermore, because the bridge over the Vistula River required crossing the Polish border, they preferred to hire small ferries and detour. It is reported that Lutze will return to his country on Sunday after listening to a political speech by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] This city is currently eagerly awaiting the arrival of the British King and Queen. The British King and Queen will disembark in Raritan, New Jersey, and then travel by car to Cockroft's Point, before boarding a destroyer to New York, which is only ten miles from the Port of New York.

The King and Queen will have lunch at the Fair and visit the Canadian, Irish, and British pavilions in the afternoon.

Later, Senator Pittman said that the King had expressed to Congress his gratitude for the sincerity of the American people, saying, "I am privately grateful for the universal affection shown to me, and it is difficult to express in words." Mrs. Roosevelt, at her press conference, praised the Queen as "a young queen with a loving heart who can empathize with the suffering of the people." President Roosevelt also told the press that he had an informal discussion of international issues with the King, but that the matters discussed were not of particular importance.

<h3 id="e34">International Labor's Aid-China Movement <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Baoquan</p>
<p>For twenty-three months, the heroic resistance of the Chinese people has shown the world that we are fighting for our own national independence and freedom, against the fascist forces of East Asia, and for the peace of the entire world. Therefore, from the very beginning of our sacred and just war of resistance, we have received assistance from peace-loving people around the world. They have not only extended a hand of sympathy to us, but have also provided us with various kinds of help, both spiritual and material.</p>
<p>During this period, many international organizations, such as the League of Nations, the League of Nations Association, and the International Anti-Aggression League, have been doing their best to mobilize people in various countries to actively support China. The International Anti-Aggression League has convened several conferences to call on all countries to boycott Japanese goods. In July of last year, it also held an International Anti-Bombing Conference to oppose fascist bombing of undefended cities in East Asia and Western Europe, and the killing of innocent peace-loving people. In addition, even the Second International and the International Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution in early spring of last year to help the Chinese people resist aggression and sanction the violent acts of aggression by Japan. The International Labor Conference also passed a resolution in June of last year to continue to help the Chinese people. In individual countries, the United Kingdom has the China Aid Movement Committee, and the United States, France, and Belgium have "Friends of China" organizations. They publish various China aid magazines and publications, organize various China aid activities and demonstrations, and donate money and medicine to help China's war of resistance.</p>
<p>Currently, the scope of the international China aid movement is not only widespread in Europe and the United States, but also in South America, South Africa, Australia, the West Indies, India, and Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in the Malay Peninsula. Among them, the working class of various countries is the most active in participating in the China aid movement. This fact proves that "the working class is the most advanced class, the greatest force in modern society," and "the most determined and thorough advocate and organizer of peace."</p>
<p>The international labor aid-China movement is mostly manifested in refusing to load and unload goods for Japanese ships and boycotting Japanese goods. This also shows that workers in various countries have realized that transporting one more ton of scrap iron to Japan and selling more Japanese goods is helping Japanese fascists kill more Chinese brothers. Therefore, in the United States, there is a warning slogan: "Buying a pair of silk stockings is like sending bullets for four rows of machine guns to Japan!"</p>
<p>We can cite many examples of international labor aid-China here.</p>
<p>As early as January of last year, the National Railway Workers Union of the United States held a conference in Bristol and resolved to boycott Japanese goods and refuse to transport all wartime industrial raw materials to Japan. In the same month, dockworkers in Middlesbrough decided not to ship pig iron to Japan, and even sacrificed several days of unemployment benefits because of refusing to transport steel. This is even more worthy of our respect. Similar situations have occurred in London, Liverpool, Bristol, and Southampton. In June, miners in South Wales unanimously resolved to implement a boycott movement. At the end of last year, Manchester, one of the major industrial cities in the United Kingdom, held a large-scale anti-Japanese movement. In addition, China aid marches and demonstrations in various cities are also often heard.</p>
<p>French workers have not lagged behind the British. When dockworkers in Middlesbrough, England, refused to load steel for Japanese ships, dockworkers in Marseille, France, immediately responded and decided to refuse to transport any goods used for Japanese warfare. During the "May Day" celebration last year, more than 60,000 workers in Paris held a large demonstration in the suburbs of Paris. In addition to paying tribute to China, they also advocated that French workers should actively boycott Japanese goods to help China.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation in the United States. In February of last year, more than 500,000 miners in the United States unanimously boycotted Japanese goods and opposed fascist aggression. Due to the organization of various China aid groups, many marches and demonstrations, "frugal eating campaigns," "one bowl of rice campaigns," and donations have been held in various cities in the United States. Tens of millions of workers saved a portion of their meager wages to help the Chinese people. Longshoremen at various seaports also refused to transport steel to Japan. For example, in December of last year, a large number of workers in San Francisco refused to load scrap iron for Japan, and more than 2,000 longshoremen responded immediately. Subsequently, workers in Long Beach, California, and Astoria, Oregon, also refused to transport scrap iron to Japan. The American Federation of Labor also passed a resolution at its annual meeting in Houston, Texas, in mid-October of last year to continue the boycott of Japanese goods movement that had already begun in the United States.</p>
<p>These many situations are also reflected in other countries and regions. Countries such as Argentina in South America have implemented a boycott of Japanese goods. The South African Workers' Union in Cape Town, South Africa, also resolved to unanimously boycott Japanese goods. India has held several "China Days," with a large number of workers participating. In addition, the Indian National Congress sent a medical team to China to serve. In the iron mines opened by Japanese in Kuala Lumpur in the Malay Peninsula, Chinese and Indian workers jointly went on strike and refused to work for the Japanese. These many situations are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Among these many examples of labor aid to China, one thing worth mentioning here is the assistance of Australian workers to us. Workers in ports such as Melbourne and Sydney in Australia have repeatedly refused to load pig iron and scrap iron for Japanese ships. In November and December of last year, dockworkers in the port of Canberra, Australia, unanimously refused to load scrap iron for Japan. 3,500 workers from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in the port's steel factory were dismissed by the factory before Christmas for supporting these dockworkers' China aid actions. Since this incident occurred, people from all over Australia have come forward to help these 3,000+ soldiers who lost their jobs for justice. The trade unionists in New South Wales were even more vigorous, convening a conference and broadcasting by radio to support the dockworkers' actions. However, the local postmaster-general forcibly suppressed them and closed down the trade union's radio station. But this unreasonable suppression not only failed to have an effect, but instead aroused a great wave of anger. First, it was the protest of 58 trade unions in Australia. At the same time, due to the opposition of people from all walks of life, several governors, bishops, and archdioceses, the order to close the radio station was finally revoked, and workers in various ports in Australia more actively expanded the China aid movement and the embargo on scrap iron to Japan. From then on, it also proved the greatness of the power of labor.</p>
<p>We especially appeal to the working masses of all countries to let them know that the Chinese people's war of resistance is to fight for their own national independence, but also for the peace of the world, and for the peace-loving mankind of the whole world. China is a link in the world, and the victory of the Chinese people is the victory of all the people in the world, first of all, the workers of all countries. We hope that the workers of the world will extend a hand of sympathy to us, and fight together for the justice and peace of the world, and for the reduction of fascist savagery in East Asia and Western Europe!</p>

<h3 id="e35">Local Authorities Have No Intention of Devaluing the Hong Kong Dollar <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Financial Secretary Gimson Announces, Various Outside Speculations Are Not Credible</p>
<p>Recently, the exchange rate of Chinese currency has fluctuated slightly, with the price of each Hong Kong dollar being approximately equal to two Chinese yuan. Some nervous people in society, unaware that this situation is merely a temporary abnormality that will return to normal in the short term, believe that if this continues, Hong Kong's exports to China will be hit. They have thus made reckless speculations, saying that the price of Hong Kong silver dollars will inevitably be devalued to adapt to the needs of the environment. As a result, rumors have spread, and many people in society believe that these speculations are well-founded. Financial Secretary Gimson issued a special notice yesterday to clarify that the authorities have no intention of devaluing the Hong Kong dollar. For the sake of correcting the views of the public, we hereby translate the original text as follows: "In order to dispel any doubts arising from the recent dynamics of Chinese foreign exchange, I am instructed to declare that the Hong Kong government has no intention of devaluing the Hong Kong dollar or changing the policy adopted since the establishment of the Hong Kong foreign exchange fund in 1936."</p>

<p>Appeals to the World Student Union Congress to Relieve Students in War Zones of China</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Student Relief Society held its third executive committee meeting yesterday from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. More than 30 executive committee members attended, chaired by Li Zhengyao. Before the meeting, Advisor Wang Shutao was invited to speak about the news he received in Chongqing regarding the great victory in northern Hubei. The secretary read the minutes of the previous meeting, which were signed by the chairman. Reports on work were given on: 1. Organizing a bathing event at Clear Water Bay; 2. The Girls' Student Group is scheduled to be established at 1:00 PM on the 18th; 3. The Propaganda Department is holding a translation competition for the whole of Hong Kong; 4. Comforting refugees in Shenzhen; 5. Relieving refugee students in Shanghai with 100 yuan; 6. The leader of the Second Return Home Service Corps, Luo Ke, and others returned to Hong Kong to reorganize; 7. A reception is scheduled for Philippine student representatives on Monday evening; 8. Participating in the reception for the Kuala Lumpur Service Corps of 70+ people; 9. Report on this year's financial budget. After the reports on various tasks were completed, the Chairman reported on the World Student Union Congress, stating that the Society had received a letter from the Paris Student Union of France stating that the World Student Union would convene its third congress from August 14 to 19 to discuss issues focusing on "democratic countries," with the participation of 40 countries. The number of representatives was set at 50 for large countries, 30 for small countries, and 10 or 5 or fewer for each region. Whether Hong Kong should send representatives to attend is the most important proposal today. Another matter is that the Philippine Youth Congress recently planned to convene the Far East Youth Congress and sent representatives to Hong Kong to discuss it. The motivation for convening this Far East Youth Congress is due to Japan's recent active efforts to win over Philippine youth and implement deceptive measures to mislead the public. Therefore, Philippine youth are actively uniting to deal with this Japanese conspiracy. This issue will be discussed at the Far East Youth Congress. Members of the Congress will include the Philippines, China, India, Siam, Annam, and other countries. The Philippine Youth Congress has now sent representative Mr. Liu Ziwang to Hong Kong to discuss with the Society. The Society has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow night to receive Mr. Liu.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Proposals</p>
<p>After the Chairman completed his report, the agenda items were discussed. 1. World Student Union Congress issues. A. Issue of sending representatives to attend. The chairman provided his opinion, stating that the congress is of great significance, but the cost is a problem, and asked everyone to express their opinions. After much discussion, the majority opinion was to not send representatives to participate, but to achieve the Hong Kong students' wishes for the congress through other means. It was resolved and passed. B. Hong Kong student proposals. It was resolved that the Society should send a circular to all student groups and schools in Hong Kong to solicit proposals, and organize a committee to collect and organize them before submitting them to the congress for discussion and decision. The committee members expressed their opinions on the spot, which were summarized as follows: 1. Collect reports on the activities of students in China since the War of Resistance and report them to the congress; 2. Request the congress to establish a world student communication network; 3. Demand that the congress provide practical assistance to China's educational and cultural undertakings; 4. Request the congress to step up relief to students in China's war zones and establish a "Relief China Student Committee" to handle relief work on a regular basis. The above opinions will be included in the proposals. 2. Retain the two administrative advisors who resigned. Resolved and passed. 3. Omitted.</p>
<p>Presenting a Sword to the Leader</p>
<p>4. Discuss summer work issues. A. Xia Jiehua proposed to organize a "Hong Kong Students Presenting a Sword to Generalissimo Chiang and Comforting Frontline Soldiers Group" during the summer vacation. This work has the following significance: 1. Presenting a sword to Generalissimo Chiang and comforting frontline soldiers expresses the Hong Kong students' sincere support for the supreme leader and pays tribute to the loyal and brave soldiers; 2. It shows the overseas Chinese youth's loyalty to the country and their struggle for the liberation of the people; 3. Therefore, it promotes close ties between Hong Kong students and the mainland and strengthens the unity of Hong Kong students. It was originally resolved and passed, and the specific methods will be determined by the Standing Committee. B. Develop the work of various groups; C. Visit the countryside and serve the countryside; D. Serve refugees and educate refugees; E. Work in rural areas. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Concerning Public Morals: Moralists Urgently Call For a Ban on Tour Guides, Will Jointly Petition Chinese Representatives to Convey to the Authorities the Elimination of Lewd Customs <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Some years ago, the Hong Kong authorities, in order to improve the "moral values" of the residents, implemented a ban on prostitution. After the ban, most of the former prostitutes who remained in Tong Sai changed their profession to singers, and their lives were very difficult. At that time, it was said that Hong Kong was a pure and flawless city. Who would have known that after the promulgation of the ban on prostitution, private prostitution flourished, poisoning society even more severely than during the period of public prostitution? However, most self-respecting people are unwilling to get involved in "private brothels," because private prostitution is an abnormal phenomenon not permitted by law. Contact with such people is tantamount to breaking the law. Therefore, the harm of private prostitution to society is limited to only a part of the population. Those who value their own integrity may not even know where private brothels are located or where private prostitutes congregate. In recent years, the tour guide business has risen on the island. At first, the number of tour guide companies was only a few, and the number of female tour guides was also small. Their business scope was still considered prudent. Later, more and more companies were established, and competition became increasingly fierce. Now, the number of tour guide companies is in the hundreds, and the number of female tour guides is over a thousand. They all try their best to promote themselves and attract customers. As a result, the business of singers and private prostitutes is far behind. This is because they are not restricted by law. Singers and private prostitutes are even in danger of being eliminated. Public prostitution has already been banned, and private prostitution is not permitted by law. Only the tour guide business is not subject to prohibition. In a place governed by law that does not allow the existence of prostitution, it grows insidiously without any scruples. People who like to boast about "dating" often accompany female tour guides, swaggering through the streets and appearing in public places without feeling strange. If they were with singers or private prostitutes, they would never be so blatant and disregard criticism. All of these things are of great importance to social morality. As for the addresses of tour guide companies, the names of female tour guides, and their beautiful faces, we have heard and seen them in detail and are familiar with them. Social figures who pay a little attention to the situation in Hong Kong are deeply impressed by tour guide companies and female tour guides. From this, it can be asserted that the tour guide business has penetrated deeply into people's hearts, and the resulting negative impact is to be expected. Now that the tour guide business has become a universal and special business, if we conduct further research on this business, the concept of a "pure and flawless city" will definitely be shattered. The authorities previously banned prostitution in order to improve the moral values of the residents. Now, Hong Kong has discovered a phenomenon of leading people into lewdness and leading people into depravity, the harm of which is thousands of times greater than that of public and private prostitution. For the sake of Hong Kong's reputation, the authorities should immediately plan a way to eliminate this kind of harm. If it is said that banning prostitution can improve the moral standards of the residents, even the most foolish person knows that this is impossible. It is heard that concerned people among the overseas Chinese have gathered comrades to jointly petition Chinese representatives to convey to the authorities a request for a prompt ban, so that the decadent atmosphere can be eliminated. The petition is being drafted and will be submitted to the Chinese representatives soon.</p>

<p>The total amount of water stored in Hong Kong and Kowloon in May is 200 million gallons more than last year.</p>
<p>The Water Authority, in order to increase the supply of drinking water from the Kowloon Reservoir to Hong Kong Island, modified the underwater water pipe last autumn to transport water to Hong Kong. Since the construction and installation of the new water pipe, which has taken many months, the section of the project in the sea near Queen's Pier has been completed, and it can be connected to the main pipe under Queen's Pier today. For the convenience of the connection project, the Water Authority announced that water will be temporarily rationed in Hong Kong Island starting today, and the water supply will be limited to ten hours per day for two consecutive days. From 9:00 PM today to 4:00 PM next Tuesday, the water supply time will be from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM. It will return to a full day of water supply until 4:00 PM next Tuesday. As for Kowloon, it will continue to supply water all day as usual and will not be affected.</p>
<p>In addition, the Water Authority issued a report for May yesterday, stating that the total water storage in Hong Kong's reservoirs is 2,362,550,000 gallons, while in May last year it was 1,553,370,000 gallons. The average daily water consumption per person is 27.9 gallons, while in the same period last year it was 34 gallons. The current water storage in Kowloon's reservoirs is 2,901,550,000 gallons, while in the same period last year it was 1,615,09,000 gallons. The average daily water consumption per person in May this year is 21.1 gallons, while in the same period last year it was 26.8 gallons.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Hong Kong Government Civil Servants: Holiday Salary Exchange Rate Set at One Dollar for One Shilling and Three Pence <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government personnel who draw salaries during the holidays have always used the average of the monthly bank announced exchange rate as the standard. According to yesterday's Hong Kong Government Gazette, this method will be cancelled, and at the same time, the exchange rate is set at one dollar for one shilling and three pence. In other words, each pound sterling is exchanged for sixteen Hong Kong dollars. The Gazette also published an amendment to the 1937 Gold Pound Salary Exchange Regulations. The above method is also one end of the amendment to the regulations. "In accordance with Section 3 of the 1937 Regulations, the payment of salaries shall be based on the rate of one shilling and three pence in exchange for one Hong Kong dollar, and one pound sterling in exchange for sixteen Hong Kong dollars." The annex to the regulations stipulates that there is a "treasury rate." If civil servants take leave or are on regular holidays for more than three months, they can be paid according to the average of the monthly bank announced exchange rate. This example remains valid until June 1, 1939, after which the annex will be cancelled. The one shilling and three pence exchange rate specified in the amended regulations will be implemented for an indefinite period. Civil servants who take leave or are on regular holidays after June 1 must draw salaries in accordance with this new regulation.</p>

<p>A woman, Yao Xiuying (32 years old), from Shanghai, was accused at Magistrate Fu's court of the Central Magistracy yesterday morning of trespassing into the Marlborough Barracks. According to the barracks police officer Bishi Da, he said to the magistrate, "At 2:30 AM yesterday morning, I suddenly heard the sound of a woman crying and shouting wildly. I followed the sound to investigate and saw the defendant naked and not wearing anything. Later, the defendant led me to the front of the barracks detention center, where I saw the defendant's clothes hanging on the window." The magistrate asked the defendant why she entered the barracks. According to the defendant's confession, she has sisters working in the homes of Westerners on the Peak. Last night, she wanted to find her sisters. She is from Shanghai and has been in Hong Kong for a short time, so she does not know the way and accidentally entered the restricted area. Unexpectedly, two Westerners in uniform dragged her to a place and then took off her upper and lower clothes. The magistrate believes that the truth of the defendant's confession should be investigated, so the case was postponed to Monday morning for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Various Issues in Battlefield Drama <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Xian</p>
<p>The great War of Resistance, from "July 7th" until today, has been almost two years. In this national revolutionary war, like workers in other sectors, advancing drama workers have fairly fulfilled their responsibilities. Tens of thousands of young soldiers rush about on the battlefield and in the villages, swinging axes, enduring cold and hunger, and steadfastly guarding their posts.  In reality, most of them had no connection with drama before the war. The reason they chose the drama position is very simple: drama is the best propaganda weapon! For two years, they have used this weapon to play a significant propaganda role and educate countless people. However, they have also encountered unspeakable suffering! (Overcoming difficulties, discarding the elements of failure, reaping the fruits of success, educating themselves, and growing!)</p>
<p>These young soldiers have been traveling to various battlefields for two years, and what the audience sees in the streets and alleys and on hillsides and lawns are almost entirely one-act plays. ('Living newspapers' are also included here. Multi-act plays are rare on the battlefield!) This is good! The era we are experiencing is an era unparalleled in history. We pay our highest respect to the young fighters who work hard on the front lines! We should understand the difficult environment they are in and should not make excessive demands! At the same time, I believe that the performance effect of a one-act play on the battlefield is unimaginable without personal experience. One-act plays easily give the audience a complete impression, easily capturing the extremely tense time and space. Therefore, it is also conducive to work outside of drama - organization after propaganda. (Pay attention to this. Performing drama on the front lines is not merely performing!) Subjectively, one-act plays are incredibly convenient for a theater troupe: set design, props, lighting, actors, and stage staff can all easily solve difficulties. Objectively, the audience does not have to spend a lot of time and has enough time to repeatedly reflect on the plot.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of one-act plays is that there are too many long dark scenes, and they cannot dissect a story in detail for the audience like a multi-act play. However, I believe that this is only a matter of writing technique! (Of course, it is easier to handle a subject in a multi-act play than in a one-act play. But forcing some one-act play subjects into multi-act plays is also a waste!) If we fundamentally oppose performing one-act plays on the battlefield based on this, (and there are actually people who oppose it now!) I think it is unreasonable! The effects of countless one-act plays performed in the past two years, the touching stories, can only be told by the drama workers themselves. As for the audience regarding the treacherous officials in the play as loyal ministers, and regarding mothers who put righteousness before family as proof that "the most poisonous heart is a woman's," I believe that this is not a problem of one-act plays versus multi-act plays. This involves acting, makeup, language, and script issues. (The script issue is naturally more important.)</p>
<p>Scripts are indeed a major problem on the battlefield. Since the War of Resistance, how many satisfactory scripts have we produced? As far as I know, the ones performed most often on the battlefield are probably "Lay Down Your Whip" and "Seeking Survival from Death." It is still being performed now, no wonder Mr. Xia Yan has his feelings! However, the "script shortage" is a significant fact. Counting the published scripts, the number is indeed not small! However, workers on the battlefield do not dare to easily stage them, because they fear that they will have a counterproductive effect on the audience. Even without this concern, some scripts, even if the audience watches them a thousand times, are still vague. It seems that we cannot blame the audience for being "stupid". The playwrights should reflect on themselves, and it is not difficult to find their shortcomings. As Gorky said: "Dry, lifeless, without personality." Some scripts are formulaic, all the same. After watching the first half, the audience doesn't need to watch the second half. Can we completely attribute the opposite effect and the vague impression to the drama workers who are born and die on the front lines? Can we say that this is being prevented by "one-act plays"?</p>
<p>Gorky said in the same article: "We live in a profoundly dramatic era never before seen, we live in a tense, dramatic era in the process of discarding the old and creating the new. But only those who work constantly can understand such people." (On Drama) Therefore, to solve the "script shortage" problem, it is best to have people working on the front lines, but they often turn the expectation of "division of labor" into reality. Moreover, due to practical difficulties, it is put aside, which is a bad phenomenon. People living and working on the front lines should be determined to overcome this difficulty. Dependence has led to a sense of desolation today and will leave an unnecessary blank for the future. How will we settle this blood debt with history?</p>
<p>Along with the "script shortage" and other issues, another phenomenon has occurred on the front lines: excessive repetition and blanks. In some places, many groups are concentrated, while in other places, people are waiting to pioneer. This is one. Secondly, in places where groups are concentrated, the performed programs are often repeated countless times. The first point belongs to the issue of distribution, and the second point belongs to the issue of distribution and the "script shortage". The problem of the "script shortage" has already been discussed earlier. The distribution problem can be discussed from two aspects: the distribution of groups should be decided by the political departments of each war zone, and the performance programs should be discussed with the local government. This way, the effect of overall planning can be achieved.</p>
<p>There are two more serious problems in battlefield performance: insufficient actors and a lack of materials.</p>
<p>The number of pure drama groups working on the front lines is relatively small. General salvation groups combine propaganda, organization, and training. The weapons of propaganda include drama, singing, writing, painting, photographs, and even oral communication, using all possible ways to penetrate the masses and be accepted by them. The war zone area is too large, making it impossible and insufficient to specialize each group. Many groups, especially local groups, such as the Shangcheng Student Service Corps and the Wuchang County Teachers Wartime Service Corps, because they have to undertake various tasks in that region, the situation must be general, and naturally, they will not focus on performing. Since the number of people is limited, once a performance is put on, actors immediately feel that they are not enough to be distributed. In the past, the remedy was joint performances; but this is not the best way. Many groups should not be concentrated in one location, and in fact, there are not many times when they are concentrated, so joint performances can only be done occasionally. I think the most thorough way should be to clarify the individuality of the groups. General groups should be localized, and specialized groups should move frequently. But to do this, the first thing to do is overall planning. The responsible organization is the General Political Department and the political departments of each war zone. The scope of movement of specialized groups should preferably be based on war zones.</p>
<p>With the solution of this problem, the lack of materials will also be easier to solve. In the past, thousands of groups had to prepare their own props, costumes, lighting, ... for performances. Now that the performing groups are specialized, it is easier to organize. Of course, government funding is needed! Government funding will also not be as difficult as in the past.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, most of the thousands of drama workers working on the battlefield had no connection with drama before the war. Naturally, they will feel deficient in acting and drama in various aspects, and the most difficult thing is the lack of directors. In China, the history of the spoken drama movement is still very short. Now that the field has been expanded to such a wide extent, the lack of talent is immediately felt, not to mention that many "drama people" who were active for a while before the war ran to the rear and became disconnected from the War of Resistance? The lack of directors can be partially solved by specializing theater troupes, but new directors should be trained. Before starting training, small books on directing methods and acting training should be compiled as soon as possible, so that general salvation groups have a basis and use these suitable teaching materials to remedy the current shortcomings using collective directing methods.</p>
<p>As for the dialect problem, it is relatively minor. Local groups do not have this problem at all. If the mobile groups are based on war zones, it will not become a big problem. The language of performance is naturally best in Mandarin. However, in some places, such as South China, Mandarin is quite problematic, so dialects must be used. Dialects also have an advantage: they sound familiar to the audience. However, if there is no difficulty with Mandarin, it is better to use Mandarin. Carrying out national revolution is approached from many aspects. When the people are suffering great difficulties and unprecedented migrations and unprecedented integration, the unification of language is a good opportunity to accelerate.</p>
<p>Because I have worked on the battlefield for a period of time, today I am merely presenting the difficulties encountered by many groups in battlefield performances with my own views, hoping that experts will pay attention and find ways to improve and remedy them. The era is too great, and the great era is a furnace. Who can disconnect from the War of Resistance? History is the most ruthless. It will tell us who is declining and who is destroying himself! Strong workers will stand tall in the face of history. I pay my highest respect to them! June 9th, Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e55">The Inevitable Decline of the Star Actor System <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chao</p>
<p>The star system in film and the star actor system in drama are undoubtedly deformed fruits of capitalism, the offspring of an unhealthy transitional period in art. It is inevitable that one day it will sound its own death knell. Countless complex and intricate conclusions from history tell us that the existence of any system has a background of a certain era. When it exceeds the background of this era, it will be canceled and replaced by another new system by the corner of another era, just as the feudal system cancels the primitive commune system, the capitalist system cancels the feudal system; ... the same truth as the Three Principles of the People's Grand Harmony system cancels the aggressive fascist system. It is undoubtedly certain that the star system in the drama world will be canceled by the "no star actor" system.</p>
<p>In the process of the anti-fascist Three Principles of the People's revolution, what is reflected in the drama world is: the decline of groups of outdated and famous people, and the rise of countless unnamed folk artists. This proves that the "star actor system," a "child of capitalist society" supported by the capitalist system, has gradually reached beyond the limits of its era, like a shooting star falling off course and disappearing, and finally collapsed without a fight.</p>
<p>...The golden age of the star system and the harbinger of decline...</p>
<p>To fully understand the reason for the decline of any system, it is necessary to clearly understand its growth process. The birth of the star system in the drama world has its social characteristics. In a society where art products, and even artists, must become commodities under capitalism, the owners of theater troupes or theaters are forced to compete in order to exchange works as commodities to make a living. To win the market, they have to resort to competition. However, competition requires stronger technology and better goods, because they must have excellent goods to embark on the path of struggle. The owners of theaters or theater troupes have to choose more excellent actors from countless excellent actors. They also use various advanced propaganda techniques, or give more performance opportunities, to make him succeed as a part of the representatives, and use him to call on the large group of worshipers he attracts and mesmerizes - commodity buyers - to support the life of the drama workers and the life of the theater troupe. This is the factor that gave rise to the star system - even if this factor is not the main whole, it must be the main link in the whole.</p>
<p>Of course, the star system has its lovely golden age, especially when capitalism develops to its most prosperous. These precious days are still vigorously growing in theater troupes or theaters in capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, and France, floating in beautiful colorful clothes. However, inevitably, due to the increasingly sharp and profound internal contradictions of capitalist society and the increasing demands of art appreciators, it has gradually begun to be turbulent. For example, the famous star actor and movie star Li An Nuo Ba Li Mo in England, because he gradually lost the support of the audience, had to retreat to supporting roles, which is a very good proof.</p>
<p>...The impact of the star system on the drama movement...</p>
<p>At the same time, the star actor system has a great obstructive point to the drama movement, which needs to be pointed out. Usually, in order to create a star actor, a theater troupe unconditionally makes him perform many scripts and have him take on important roles. This situation will naturally stipulate a mechanical iron law of "the more popular, the more popular" and "the unpopular will never be popular." Even if later actors have some outstanding acting talent, they will stand by in vain and never have a chance to raise their heads, burying many useful talents, directly and indirectly causing great damage to the drama movement. What's more, due to the importance attached to star actors by the owners of theater troupes or theaters, they unconsciously raise their status to a high level, cultivating the actor's underlying arrogance and unwillingness to endure hardship - which is meaningless and even prevents the achievement of great art - sometimes, because the actor knows that his reputation and status (originally created by the theater troupe owner's painstaking efforts) already has the ability to exist independently, he raises his banner and goes far away, throwing himself into the arms of others, regardless of the mother nest. Even if it does not reach this extreme, in the rehearsals or rehearsals in the theater troupe, it often happens that the star actor who plays an important role is absent due to some improper reason, or does not arrive on time, which delays the rehearsal time or puts the rehearsal on hold. Although this is a trivial matter, it has a lot of damage to the collective life of the theater troupe and the seriousness of the drama movement.</p>
<p>What's even more annoying is that when the curtain is about to be drawn at the last moment before the official performance, time is running out mercilessly, and the star actor is still late, or arrives gracefully one minute before the opening, but cunningly proposes to pay before performing. (Amateurs also have other tricks) It is not difficult to see in the backstage that the stage manager or the theater troupe owner is sweating profusely under the pressure of the audience's applause urging the opening, and begging the star actor to kowtow and plead to put on makeup. As a result, it is only after paying full or half salary that the matter is successfully completed - of course, this is a good reward for the theater troupe owner's self-inflicted suffering - however, the drama workers' faith in the audience has gradually been destroyed.</p>
<p>...The poisoning of the star system to actors...</p>
<p>The reason why an artist becomes a great artist is not, as art-for-art's-sake advocates or inspirationists say, because of "genius." "Genius" - this is just a goblin that deceives people and leads them to depravity. Looking at the great artists of the past world, it can be said that there are absolutely few who succeed entirely by relying on genius. Even if there is genius, it is only a small part of the sum of hard work. In other words, their success depends more on hard work than on genius. For example, the success of the Soviet Art Theater director, the pioneer of the Soviet people, and the playwright Stanislavsky, is entirely due to his glorious hard work and his great determination to serve the art of the Soviet people, and it is not necessarily due to any genius.</p>
<p>However, star actors are often followers of the genius superstition. The reason is that they began to taste the life of drama, or by chance they were discovered by the theater troupe or theater owner - which is indeed not an easy thing - and they were recognized as having the hope of becoming the star that the theater troupe owner expected. He (the theater troupe owner) then inadvertently put the hat of "genius" on the actor's head. In this way, the actor, who was initially flattered and then arrogant, forgot all about the phrase "hard work and self-cultivation" and replaced it in his mind with a "no passage" signpost - "genius."</p>
<p>In fact, to succeed as a truly great actor, it is necessary to do at least what the famous Soviet director F. Kaweilin said: "...Actors must constantly improve their knowledge and cannot rely solely on what they have learned in drama school..." "Actors in leading positions in the theater must also be as enthusiastic about art as young beginners, and must make everyone unconsciously satisfied; get into the mire of complacency and self-satisfaction, even the highest skills and the greatest genius will inevitably have to shrink back." This point is true. However, star actors who superstitiously believe in genius often disregard it! The angel of famous saying will eventually defeat the demon of superstitious genius.</p>
<p>Secondly, what poisons star actors even more is "typical making." The biggest reason why the above-mentioned Li An Nuo Ba Li Mo can only play supporting roles now may be because his acting art has reached the realm of "typical." When an actor just plays the typical of a certain type of role, he has already announced the death penalty of his acting creation, and from then on he will gradually be forgotten by the audience. However, the operators of theater troupes will never forget the power that money gives them. In order to call on the audience and to support the life of the theater troupe, they need and use a typical actor with a highly confusing power like a god to compete. Therefore, star actors are unconditionally selected. Therefore, he (the star actor) is given various opportunities to start creating a typical of a certain type of role, and as soon as he succeeds, he will begin the sentence of death - due to the awakening of the believers or when he gradually feels that this god cannot give them more happiness.</p>
<p>...The inevitability and practice of overthrowing the star system...</p>
<p>Whether it is for the drama movement, the theater troupe, or the actors, it is poisonous. It goes without saying that it is necessary to overthrow the "star actor system." What is being correctly and bravely implemented now is socialist Soviet Russia. The actors in their theaters are all art-loving workers. Regardless of whether their artistic cultivation is deep or shallow, they all live an equal artistic life. There is no longer any distinction between "popular roles" and "star actors." As for movies, there is no star system either.</p>
<p>The final conclusion we have reached is: the star system will eventually die with the old society. In the process of the Three Principles of the People's revolutionary struggle, all stale systems are mercilessly eliminated. When the final victory comes, it will be the time when all the old dies and the new grows.</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Performance of "Peace Under Heaven" <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Xi</p>
<p>The revolutionary May is also the drama May. In mid-May, major theater troupes were busy performing, forming the biggest climax in the Hong Kong drama movement. June, which comes after the May drama climax, will be even more tense and deeply displayed.</p>
<p>The first major event marking the beginning of June's drama movement is the first public performance of the Red and White Theater Troupe. They performed a new type of satirical comedy, "Peace Under Heaven," with a new lineup.</p>
<p>Zhao Rulin made the following introduction in "Comedy of Resistance Against Japan is Growing": "Humor is an essential spice in the anti-Japanese drama. 'Peace Under Heaven' purely satirizes certain people in this place who are said to be living in a dream of death, living a life of diligently pursuing profit. This stimulus hopes to correct the general people's psychology of complacency and wrong worldview."</p>
<p>Indeed, the story of "Peace Under Heaven" is produced in a specific environment. Those who live in "Peace Under Heaven" are specific people. Therefore, the playwright gives these characters a variety of life descriptions, and consistently expresses them through the form of comedy.</p>
<p>The performance of "Peace Under Heaven" is a new attempt and a new stimulus. In terms of the script itself, it is a new type of work that breaks away from formulaic and photographic writing. In terms of style, it is pungent and full of profound and sharp alert performance.</p>
<p>The director's handling of this play has reached a certain appropriate degree. He did not allow the performance of the script to become a funny play or a farce. However, he does not seem to be able to fully apply the methods that should be used to handle a comedy. This is a slightly demanding point of mine.</p>
<p>The stage design is full of realistic style, rendering bright colors and natural angles. It's just that the setting of the distant view is not very presentable. The stage lighting maintains the appropriate brightness and light distance in the first and second acts. In the third act, the display of time is not very obvious.</p>
<p>As for the performance, Li Boming (played by Xu Guoyu) is a very important role. The performer has made great efforts to imitate his posture and expression, but the performance is still not delicate enough. Both the action and the demeanor seek to transform into a middle-aged person. The third concubine (played by Lulu) naturally reveals the character's personality, and the performance is stable. The fourth concubine (played by Tang De) gives the character extremely rich and true emotions. The internal reaction is also enough, but the hand movements lack a beautifying angle. A De (played by Hu Ruihua) gave a very delicate performance, but the display of the character's class is not enough. However, this is mostly due to the writing of the script. Jin Zizhang (played by Li Zhulun) is very capable of using his eyes and hands to help the performance of a greasy and sly merchant, but he lacks deep life experience. Li Mingyuan (played by Ling Ke) has a firm grasp of the character's personality, but the performance of the posture is a bit old, Li Mingzhu (played by Die Er) bites the words loud and powerful, and lacks delicate insertions. Li Mingying (played by Zhong Ying) and Mingda (played by Shi Bing) have enough strength, but no profound performance.</p>
<p>In the performance, we can directly and indirectly see that: the comrades of the Red and White Theater Troupe have made every effort they should subjectively under the constraints of extremely difficult material conditions to hold this huge performance, which is worthy of our respect.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Creation Process of the Battle of Taierzhuang <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiwei</p>
<p>"The Battle of Taierzhuang" is an excellent script created through the collective understanding and highly skilled collective creation of the China Salvation Drama Troupe from the vivid and bloody reality of the War of Resistance. It has been performed several times in Guilin and Hong Kong, receiving unprecedented acclaim from the cultural circles. The author of this article, one of the four writers of the script, allows us to further understand the detailed process of how an excellent script is produced, and their serious attitude towards creation—the meticulous attitude towards historical facts. It also provides an opportunity to introduce this script to readers. This script has been published by Life Bookstore as one of the books of the China Salvation Drama Troupe. According to the editor, the first edition is about to be sold out in less than half a month, which further shows how excellent the content of this script is! ·Editor·</p>
<p>When we bid farewell to the Dabie Mountains and walked from Shangcheng to Songpi, we encountered unforgettable things on the way.</p>
<p>At that time, we had already passed a hundred and twenty li of the expedition, watching a wisp of remaining red fall behind this mountain, and nine crystalline stars were inlaid in the sky, it was already dusk. We stopped at a deserted small station, sitting in front of the thatched hut, listening to several warriors who had participated in the Battle of Taierzhuang narrating the story of the battle at that time with a slightly excited, rough, and boastful expression. What a group of lovely and valiant heroes returning in triumph! We wanted to see their faces under the sparse starlight, but the night was too dark. A round medal was proudly worn on their left lapels, emitting an unusual brilliance.</p>
<p>After arriving in Songpi, we met Mr. Li several times, who was slightly weathered and weary, but his grace and kindness made people feel a warm caress, and sincerely want to get close to him. Once, we were performing a play in the headquarters, and Mr. Li calmly mingled among hundreds of officers and soldiers, watching quietly, revealing boundless smiles, his expression serene. No one felt a little restraint. It is hard to believe that such a kind elder is actually a national pillar bearing the safety of the world. We silently thought that with such an admirable leader and such brave and good-fighting soldiers, the victory of Taierzhuang was inevitable, and the future of China was bright.</p>
<p>So we started thinking about performing Taierzhuang. Coincidentally, the fourth and sixth teams of the Political Department had both arrived in Songpi. After discussion, it was decided to have a joint performance, using the script "Taierzhuang" written by Mr. Xijin, Luo Feng, and others. At that time, we felt that although the story structure of this script was very tight, it lacked a realistic depiction of the Battle of Taierzhuang, which was a defect. However, due to time constraints, we only slightly modified the parts of the script that lacked drama.</p>
<p>But the two performances ended in a tragic way: ×× advanced into eastern Hubei, and the bloody battle was in full swing. × planes came to the war zone to reconnoiter every day. Although Songpi was a small town, it had become a major target due to military relations. On the morning of September 26th, after eight consecutive days of rain, the sky had just revealed a bit of clearness, and × planes had reconnoitered three times in a row, and even strafed at low altitude. The situation at that time was indeed extremely tense, and everyone knew that a major bombing was inevitable today. But because we had a serious task in front of us, everyone was still very calm in performing their duties. At about 2 p.m., more than sixty of us drama workers were gathered on the stage, busy with setting up when suddenly a heavy bomber sound, like thunder, swept over. Before we had time to move, twenty-seven heavy bombers rushed straight to our heads. We could not disperse for a while, so we had to lie down under the stage. In that moment, more than a hundred bombs rained down like dense rain, explosions erupted everywhere, houses collapsed and bridges broke, smoke filled the sky. The trees on the opposite bank, two or three thousand meters away from us, were immediately hit by bombs, their branches and leaves scattered, and the flying earth and debris fell on us. And the dense machine guns kept firing fiercely. The small town, under the threat of destruction, spewed out towering black smoke. After thirty minutes, × planes finally soared away. As a result, our comrade Xiao Ziying and comrade Pu Shaozhe of the fourth team were injured, while comrade Hui Xingzhi of the sixth team was sacrificed on the spot. When he died, he was holding a bunch of ropes tightly in his hand, which was used to hang the national flag in the play of Taierzhuang. To express our respect and mourning for Comrade Hui, we specially covered his remains with a national flag stained with blood, and wished him to rest in peace forever in the ground with the loyal souls of the martyrs.</p>
<p>At the end of September, we returned to Hankou and met Mr. Bai, who gave us many inspirations. His far-reaching and insightful views gave us a deeper understanding of the War of Resistance and our future work.</p>
<p>We arrived in Guilin in October and performed more than ten times. We are grateful for the care of the vast audience, who made more enthusiastic demands on us. At the same time, Mr. Huang and Mr. Xia from the provincial government, Mrs. Li, who presided over the Children's Welfare Institute, and Mr. Liu from the Guangxi Support Association also discussed with us, asking us to hold performances for raising money for winter clothing for the anti-× soldiers at the front and for the Children's Welfare Institute Fund. Under such a serious working significance and under such earnest urging and expectation, we did not hesitate to decide to perform Taierzhuang again.</p>
<p>So, the question was raised again: should we adopt the original script, or create a new one? After collective discussion, it was decided to write our own. The biggest reason was that we wanted to faithfully reflect Taierzhuang as a great historical theme. Of course, in order to make the plot lively and vivid, in the drama, we sometimes used a refined story to connect the beginning and end, but its role was also limited to this.</p>
<p>At that time, it was decided that Wang Ying, Jin Shan, Mu Zhizheng, and Liu Danqing would be the writers, but the time allotted was extremely short, because we were preparing to go abroad for propaganda at this time. In order to avoid conflicts between these two tasks, we had to shorten the writing time to within seven days. To write a five-act historical play in such a hasty time almost left us helpless!</p>
<p>But courage broke through all the difficulties, and we finally started writing. The initial division of labor was that Danqing constructed the story and wrote the first three acts, Jinshan and Wang Ying wrote the fourth and fifth acts, and Zhiwei and the entire team were responsible for the whole script. However, before the first draft was completed, we replaced it with a new creative method: the four writers sat together, and every story, every action, every line was written on paper after common thinking and deliberation. Although this felt wasteful and clumsy in terms of time, on the whole, it allowed the entire script to be more complete and refined.</p>
<p>In the process of creation, we encountered many difficulties: First of all, our academic ability and experience were not enough to melt many rich historical materials into art and condense them into perfect works of art. Whenever we felt such difficulty, we always held on to the basic attitude of preferring to sacrifice artistic value rather than damage the true meaning of history. Therefore, we did not exaggerate the story intentionally for the sake of drama, but rather put the story into the track of history. This considerably restricted the development of the plot, and at the same time, we also had to consider the number of people in our team to ensure that it would not affect our independent performance, so we had to make appropriate restrictions. In terms of material, because we did not have many books at hand, we could only refer to a small amount of material, but we also made a lot of painstaking searches. As for the need to adapt to the stage conditions, we sometimes made slight changes in certain places. If there are still places in the play that do not conform to the actual situation at the time, we sincerely hope to get instructions and understanding from all parties!</p>
<p>Regarding the characters in the play, it is necessary to add an explanation about the handling of the poet Tang Ke and the British journalist Simpson. Originally, poets are full of emotions, but sometimes they are often regarded as lacking enthusiasm due to their extraordinary sensitivity, and are misunderstood as a kind of romantic impulse. On this point, we hesitated a lot, and later decided to write it anyway, and the task we intended for the poet was to hope to convey the great victory of Taierzhuang to tens of thousands of viewers through his enthusiasm, and inspire greater strength for the War of Resistance. Whether we can achieve the ideal level depends entirely on the writing of the script and the degree of the actors' performance. The British journalist Simpson has consistently appeared with a sympathetic attitude. We believe that all impartial people in the international community will understand and help the great revolutionary war of our Republic of China with the most sublime and enthusiastic friendship!</p>
<p>After seven days of work, "The Battle of Taierzhuang" was completed as scheduled. At that time, because there was still a lot of other work to do during the day, we couldn't spare any time, so most of the writing was done in the middle of the night. The four of us buried our heads under a dim light, a gust of cool wind blew in from the window, and occasionally a wisp of thin voice trailing and stopping on the street to sell, as if we were once again experiencing the scene of the battlefield in the lonely wilderness.</p>
<p>After writing, we first made a review, which we regretted was that due to manpower reasons, many heroic stories of soldiers and civilians helping in the battle could not be realistically brought to the stage and were abandoned. We can only quote the heroic deeds of a few daredevil teams to simulate the general hard-fought soldiers. We are very sorry and uneasy about this. We would like to add a sentence here that the great victory of Taierzhuang was a hard-won achievement achieved by thousands of heroic soldiers cooperating with the extensive guerrilla warfare, under the leadership of wise officers, and promoting a strong spirit of attack. They are the most glorious descendants of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>In addition, the lack of typical character, the lack of delicate writing, can only be regarded as a rough work. Fortunately, at a symposium we convened, we heard many valuable opinions from friends in the literary and art circles, which gave us the opportunity to revise it. Therefore, the second play has different places from the original in terms of characters and plot.</p>
<p>We are very grateful to Mr. Ai Qing, Lin Lin, Xia Yan, Yang Hu, Sun Shiyi, Sheng Cheng, and Zheng Yangu for providing many valuable opinions. Mr. Ni even gave written advice in his busy schedule. Mr. Rokuchi Dan and Ms. Midorikawa helped translate Japanese songs and Japanese military language. We would like to express our sincere gratitude here!</p>
<p>If our performance can somewhat praise the true meaning of the Battle of Taierzhuang, that would be our greatest honor.</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Shenbao Cup Charity Basketball Tournament Opened Yesterday. Zhixing Fought Hard to Defeat Xinan. Zhonghua Defeated Huaxiong Greatly and Elegantly <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) The female athletes in the basketball circle enthusiastically participated in the Shenbao Cup charity tournament this time, seeking orders in times of difficulty, with chivalrous hearts and tender feelings, worthy of praise.</p>
<p>This charity tournament officially opened the war last night in the gymnasium of the YMCA. The four female warriors are lively and actively performing a series of good plays, pleasing to the eye. The distinguished guests in the audience were delighted.</p>
<p>The first play was co-performed by the ladies of Zhixing and Xinan. Because everyone tried their best, there were many highlights, and there were very few dull moments.</p>
<p>The Zhixing team has Chen Rongtang, Li Baozhen, He Defang, Lin Shaoping, Sun Yuming, Gu Gong, etc., all of whom are veteran players, performing extraordinarily, with great momentum, good connections, and free and easy performance, making everything they touch successful. Therefore, from beginning to end, they occupied the upper hand.</p>
<p>However, the attack from Xinan was also strong, especially in spirit. Although their skills were not as good as others, their morale was consistent. Under the resistance, they gained something. Zhu Zongxian and Wu Ruixin had very high skills and were often able to take advantage of the opportunity. However, encountering the Zhixing guards, who were steady and solid, they had no way to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>First Battle</p>
<p>After the start, the Zhixing forwards immediately launched an attack. Before they knew it, Miss Rongtang had penetrated deep and scored under the basket. Then, Li Baozhen also hit two "peacock screens." At this point, Xinan began to return a little color by Wu Ruixin. After the first quarter, Zhixing took the lead with ten to four.</p>
<p>The battle restarted, and the stalemate was very fierce. The Xinan forwards were not easy to succeed under the interception of the opponent's guards, and it was also difficult for the Zhixing forward troops to score. Therefore, Zhixing only scored three goals in the second quarter, and Xinan scored two goals. The total score ended the first half with sixteen to eight.</p>
<p>The battle situation in the third quarter was also as stalemate as in the second quarter. You attacked, I killed, like a few flowers competing for beauty, which was very beautiful. At the end of this quarter, the record board showed twenty to eleven, with Zhixing taking the lead.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, Xinan did not gain anything except for Zhu Xuanzhi's two free throws. Zhixing was crowned by Chen Rongtang and Li Baozhen, adding five more points. As a result, Zhixing won with twenty-five to thirteen.</p>
<p>The best performer in the Zhixing team was Rongtang, whose passing and shooting showed great skill. Baozhen also tried her best, but her shooting skills were still lacking. Sun Yuming guarded the pass alone, with great prestige, and repeatedly transported the ball to the forwards, indirectly contributing a lot. Lin Shaoping, He Defang, etc. also performed steadily. In short, Zhixing's defense was better than its offense, and it was a steady and solid strong team.</p>
<p>The Xinan forwards were quite agile, and their shooting skills were good, but because they were blocked by the opponent's two guards, Yuming and Shaoping, they were unable to use them as they wished. Li Chanqing was the most competent in defense, and the rest were average.</p>

<p>Second Battle</p>
<p>The battle between Zhonghua and Huaxiong followed. Because of the strong and weak strengths, it turned into a one-sided situation after the start. Huaxiong had difficulty in progressing and it was not easy to defend. Seeing Liu Shouguang, Li Chunyu, etc., without having to deliberately create, they succeeded with a single wave. Therefore, the Huaxiong position was turned upside down. It was like a heavy rain rolling over peach blossoms and a light breeze passing over swallows. At the end of the first quarter, Zhonghua had already won with a big score of fourteen to two.</p>
<p>After that, it was still Zhonghua's world. Chunyu, Shouguang, etc., scored every time. It was most pitiful that Xiaoyu was very capable, but looking back at the Huaxiong forwards, they wanted to show off but couldn't, and had no chance with the basket. The team leader Lei Yuegui was so anxious that she frequently stole glimpses of her loose hair. At the end of the first half, with a score of five to twenty-two, Huaxiong had already shown signs of a big defeat--</p>
<p>After a short break, the battle started again. Zhonghua had the upper hand, so they didn't do too much. Rao Huizhen's rear army was transferred to the front army, and the performance was also successful. Huaxiong was in a slump, and the third quarter handed in a blank score. Only in the last quarter did Lei Yuegui score several baskets, creating a record of more than ten points, but it was still inevitable to be defeated. As a result, with a score of forty-seven to thirteen, Zhonghua sang a triumphant song.</p>
<p>In this battle, on the Huaxiong side, the only thing worth mentioning was that the thirteen points were all managed by Lei Yuegui alone, which was a miracle.</p>
<p>On the Zhonghua side, everyone had good skills, so they could control the overall situation. The front-line Shouguang and Chunyu cooperated very tacitly, passing to each other, writing articles with their hands, which was wonderful. The guards responded easily to the opponent's weak attack, with no leaks at all. Winning this big victory was the result of excellent technology. (Taishui of the Basketball Court)</p>

<p>……Wu Tiecheng Performs the Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>……Ms. Soong Ching-ling Presents Awards</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Women's Welfare Association specially invited the Dongfang Club, Small Football League, National University Team, and Lingnan University Alumni Team to hold two small football charity matches at Caroline Hill yesterday afternoon to raise funds for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees.</p>
<p>Because it was a charity event, all sectors enthusiastically attended the meeting. It is estimated that those who came to visit included He Xiangning, Wu Tiecheng, Hu Mulan, Liao Mengxing, Soong Ching Ling and many ladies, the situation was quite lively. It is a pity that the weather was not good, sometimes cloudy and sometimes raining, so it inevitably spoiled the scenery.</p>
<p>During the game, the players were inevitably bumpy and fell because the field was slippery, and there were many jokes.</p>
<p>In both competitions, Miss Hu Mulan and Liao Mengxing accompanied Wu Tiecheng to perform the opening ceremony. After the competition, Mrs. Soong Ching-ling presented awards as a souvenir.</p>
<p>In the first game, the Dongfang Club played against the Small Football League Team. The League Team took the lead, with Li Anna scoring a goal with the wonderful pass from Lu Dakeng. However, Hou Chengtuo quickly tied the score. In the second half, Dongfang's morale was even stronger, and Xu Jingcheng scored a long shot. Then Hou Chengtuo scored twice, and Dongfang won with a score of four to one at the end of the game. The two formations are as follows:</p>
<p>Dongfang</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan Zeng Zhongyun</p>

<p>In the second game, Minda played against Lingda. Minda had many famous generals, and its strength was exceptionally strong. During the battle, Minda launched an attack and repeatedly besieged Nanda. Huang Dingfen and Lu Guanyi were busy responding, so Li Shuoyou seized the opportunity to score a goal. In the second half, Nanda tried its best to counterattack, but Minda's defense was solid, so it did not succeed. Soon after, Minda launched a counterattack, and Yang Jianbang's wonderful shot hit the target, so it won with a score of two to zero. The players of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The World Olympic Committee has decided to change the 1944 Olympic Winter Games, originally scheduled to be held in St. Moritz, Switzerland, to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The reason is that Switzerland recently refused to be responsible for hosting this year's ski show.</p>
<p>The Committee also decided to hold the 1944 Olympic Summer Games in London and the Winter Games in Cortina, Italy.</p>
<p>When the Committee held a meeting in London today, those competing with London to host the next World Games included Lausanne, Rome, and Detroit.</p>
<p>The Association also passed a special award to Ms. Leni Riefenstahl of Germany, because she was responsible for photographing the film of the last General Assembly, which made great contributions to promoting the spirit of sports of the General Assembly to the world.</p>
<p>Regarding the decision on the location of the next 1944 General Assembly, the Chairman of the Committee solemnly stated that the General Assembly's decision was made without any political effect or component, and was entirely for the purpose of sports interest and the Olympic Movement.</p>
<h3 id="e62">After Reading the "Improvement Plan for Physical Education" <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Lu</p>
<p>The method of training cadres, of course, requires the establishment of a detailed plan. It cannot be explained exhaustively in just a few words. However, we can outline the principles it must possess. Each county can compile statistics on the number of village chiefs and heads of security units in their respective counties. Each county can then independently organize and convene training sessions in phases. The training time should utilize agricultural off-seasons so as not to hinder farming activities. This should occur once a year, each time for one to two months. The training subjects should be simple and essential. Practical skills should primarily focus on traditional Chinese martial arts, gymnastics, running, and necessary military physical education. Academic subjects should emphasize essential knowledge necessary for exercise.</p>
<p>After the cadres are created, the responsibility of directly training the populace naturally falls upon the village chiefs and heads of security units. At the same time, each county must establish commissioners to supervise, distinguishing between the merits of the results, and applying rewards and punishments accordingly. Physical education teachers in local primary and secondary schools must provide compulsory assistance. Local individuals familiar with physical education and enthusiastic about service must be recruited to provide leadership. Through such continuous efforts, the promotion of social physical education may be successful.</p>
<p>Third, the cultivation and further education of physical education teachers must include the publication of central publications—The plan proposes establishing schools to cultivate genuine leading talents, setting up government-funded study abroad quotas to improve research and facilities efficiency, and requiring three years of service before short-term training, providing encouragement for high-level academic research and writing in physical education, and other measures that can be said to be well-considered. However, physical education is constantly changing, and the results of colleagues' research also yield new insights from time to time. If it must take three years to absorb new academic knowledge, or if colleagues' research findings lack opportunities for exchange, new academic knowledge and methods will inevitably be difficult to obtain and apply in a timely manner. Moreover, it is possible to discover difficult problems during the teaching process of physical education. If efforts cannot be made to find solutions and correct paths, there will be no way to truly seek them out. Isn't this greatly at odds with the original purpose of cultivation and the intention of improvement?</p>
<p>To remedy this shortcoming, the highest national physical education administrative organ should issue regular central publications for schools of all levels, large, medium, and small, as well as social physical education and physical education administration. All physical education service personnel affiliated with these organs must subscribe separately. Government physical education laws, new foreign physical education discoveries, new domestic physical education reforms, and new physical education insights from colleagues should all be published one by one. In particular, difficult problems encountered by colleagues can be questioned at any time, and the highest physical education organ is responsible for answering them. If they cannot be answered, they can be discussed publicly and decided quickly. In this way, not only can physical education teachers have the opportunity to continue their education at any time, but all improvement problems in physical education can also be resolved at any time.</p>
<p>The above three points, regarding the promotion of social physical education, may seem somewhat impossible on the surface. However, today the masses of our country have awakened and become organized. Innumerable things that were considered impossible by ordinary people can now be smoothly promoted. For example, national social military training and Guangxi's adult education are both excellent examples, and Guangxi's adult education is promoted by village chiefs and heads of security units. Therefore, if the government is determined, using the power of the government to promote education in the same way as promoting military training, I believe that our awakened masses will definitely be happy to accept it. The remaining two matters are even easier. It is hoped that those who hold the highest power in national physical education and those who are compiling the implementation plan for physical education in our country in the future will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Do Foreign Banks Accept Hua Xing Banknotes? The Japanese Side Has Made This Statement, But It Is Not Known Which Bank It Is. The Customs Side Has Not Yet Discussed the Issue of Counterfeit Currency. <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reports that a Japanese spokesperson stated at a press conference yesterday that several foreign banks have accepted Hua Xing Bank banknotes, but he does not know which banks. The spokesperson mentioned American banks to a reporter and asked if these banks accept Hua Xing banknotes. The spokesperson also firmly refuted the claim of discounting and using Hua Xing currency. It is claimed that Hua Xing headquarters has used its banknotes to exchange for foreign currency, and Japanese banks have also used Hua Xing currency to exchange for legal tender. It is also said that no arrangements have been made with the customs to accept Hua Xing currency.</p>
<p>Two Types of Counterfeit Currency Are Divided by the River Boundary</p>
<p>The English Great American Evening Post reports that members of the investigation committee organized by the "Joint Reserve Bank" and the Liaison Department of the Japanese Asia Development Board are about to come to Shanghai to discuss cooperation between the "Joint Reserve" currency and the new "Hongkou" currency with the newly established Hua Xing Commercial Bank. According to the Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, the puppet regimes in Peiping and Nanking have agreed in principle that the two currencies should be linked to each other at a fixed rate, but both currencies should maintain a fixed and not excessive circulation area. Japanese financial circles expect the circulation areas of the two counterfeit currencies to be divided along the Yellow River, with the "Joint Reserve" currency circulating north of the river and the "Hongkou" currency circulating south of the river.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Accountant Chen Derong on War Losses <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Listed as Deferred Assets With Considerable Basis</p>
<p>Accountant Chen Derong's article on war losses as deferred assets states that listing war losses as deferred assets seems to have a considerable basis in both accounting practice and theory. There are four main points: (1) Basis in accounting practice: According to the standard table of the Railway Accounting in our country, there is a item of Accumulated Deficit. Its nature is no different from war losses, both being virtual numbers in actual assets. (2) Basis in accounting principles: In Accountant Pan Xulun's book "Accounting," it is mentioned that although the nature of an expenditure is absolutely a loss for the enterprise, if it cannot be borne by the earnings of the current period, or if treating it as a loss for the current period is obviously unfair, it can be temporarily treated as a capital expenditure and listed in the balance sheet. Its meaning is simple and its principle is clear. The war losses seem to be similar to this situation. (3) The British Income Tax Law has similar provisions: According to the provisions of the British Income Tax Law, business losses can be deducted within the following six years, which other countries' tax laws have already implemented. (4) Approval from the ministry can serve as a basis: It has been found that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approval from the Ministry of Finance can still be approved and amortized over ten years, and listed as deferred actual assets, which also seems to have a basis. Other details will be discussed in my article "Further Discussion on the Issue of Listing War Losses as Deferred Assets" in the June issue of the Selection and Anthology Monthly.</p>

<h3 id="e66">China's Cotton Industry Since the Outbreak of War (Continued) <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>(Translated from Miller's Review):</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, 280 Chinese factories along the coast and along the Yangtze River, with a total capital of 40 million yuan, have moved to various cities in the southwest provinces. More than 50% of them belong to the textile industry. Its capital, labor force, output, and operating power previously accounted for one-third to two-thirds of the total number of factories in China.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese side has announced many attractive plans for developing the cotton industry in China, saying that huge amounts of Japanese funds are waiting to be invested in this industry. However, so far, none of these plans have been realized. Even the Qingdao Japanese yarn factory, which was destroyed in the war, is now being rebuilt at an extremely slow pace, and on a small scale. It is said that the Japanese side is not transporting new machines from Japan, but is transporting many machines from Chinese yarn factories in the occupied areas, especially British and American-made machines, to be installed in old Japanese yarn factories.</p>
<p>The Japanese side's ambitious plan to control the cotton industry in China has been around for a long time. Since the establishment of the first yarn factory in Shanghai by domestic and foreign societies in 1900, the Japanese have studied and understood the psychology of yarn, cotton cloth, and Chinese workers. Before the war, the Japanese had already installed or purchased about one-half of the total number of spindles in China.</p>
<p>China's imports of textile machinery and accessories are absolutely dominated by Japan. However, many of the imported Japanese textile machines are Lu spinning machines and weaving machines transported from Osaka. The huge commercial war booty obtained by the Japanese side in China is obvious. Its figures can also indicate the huge losses suffered by other countries in the past in China's important markets.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side controls the manufacturing, transportation, and sales of cotton goods, as well as the import of textiles and textile machinery, it has also established a cotton production and sales control committee. Its purpose is obvious. The export of raw cotton from North China has now been placed under the licensing system of the "Peiping Provisional Government." Government "agency organizations" for purchasing cotton have been established in Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao. Last year, about two-thirds of the cotton available in North China was transported to Japan, and it will no longer be allowed to continue to transport North China cotton to Central China. The Japanese side levies miscellaneous taxes called "protection" taxes on the transportation of raw cotton in transit, in order to expand its complete control over the transportation of raw cotton. For example, the cost of transporting one dan of cotton from Tongzhou to Shanghai used to be about three yuan, but now the cost, including various taxes, is close to eighteen yuan. Its effect is conceivable.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Ten <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Chiqiang</p>
<p>Suddenly thinking of "ten", I seized it as a topic,</p>
<p>Writing about "ten," there probably wouldn't be anyone in the world with a brain as simple as yours!</p>
<p>However, I didn't consider this aspect; one horizontal and one vertical, although not a universal library, it cannot be denied that great principles are contained within, so I braced myself and imitated Confucius's cry: "Heaven! My Way is consistent with one principle!" - That's what I thought.</p>
<p>Chinese people have always liked this "ten," regarding "ten" as candy. Examples abound.</p>
<p>Mencius was, after all, a remarkable "eat-lecture-offering gentleman" of the Warring States period, who, going against the grain, proclaimed "Am I fond of arguing?" However, he also often pinned his words and deeds on this cross.</p>
<p>"— Digging a well to nine ren but not reaching the spring is like abandoning the well."</p>
<p>Probably adding one ren, making it ten ren, would prevent abandoning the well... heartfelt advice. Speaking of nine ren, it is already arduous and deeply worked, but leaving only one ren to teach people to persevere is a bit like "a cup of water to put out a cartload of firewood"! Therefore, I dislike the "ten" character, this terminating number, symbolizing all limits.</p>
<p>We certainly do not hope for "heinous crimes," but when counting crimes, according to Mr. Lu Xun's conclusion: "Generally, there are ten items," perhaps it is another "perfectly complete" plot!</p>
<p>The ancients often said, "What ten hands point at, what ten eyes see." According to ordinary observation, if humanity has not yet evolved to "three heads and six arms," then whether "ten hands" or "ten eyes" are no more than five people. A family of five has nothing to wear, nothing to eat, and even less to teach. Then, under the pointing and watching of these so-called "ten eyes and ten hands," isn't it creating a source of overflowing sin? And in between glances, perhaps it is the driving force of revolution.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ancients often found traces of emptiness in this "ten". Similarly, for five thousand years, China, known as the land of civilization, has been able to create the moderate nature of perfection and goodness. When it comes to rewarding and punishing, this "ten" has helped or suggested it in many ways.</p>
<p>From "ten drops of medicine" to "ten directions of benefactors," this level of society contains countless thousands of cross-philosophies. (Let's say that.) And—"ten" being "ten" means self-containment, hoping to only stop at "perfection," telling us that accomplishing "ten imperfections" is also a very easy thing.</p>
<p>Isn't it because West Lake is now under the iron heel that I feel this way? I've long said that it's more than just "ten scenic spots." Apart from the current "spoiling the scenery" or adding a "copper camel and thorn bushes picture," I have intuitively or inspiredly experienced that West Lake has at least "three hundred seventy-nine and a half scenic spots." The so-called half is my hasty last half-turn admiration when I broke the reporter's well-fixed "password" with a thunderclap and reined my horse back on the lakeside. Every time I face that kind of environment, dozens of kinds of scenery emerge! However, only "ten scenic spots of West Lake" are generally allowed; this is clearly "ten" acting up and monopolizing everything.</p>
<p>After returning to Shanghai, what I settled in is still the "ten-mile foreign concession." Although I don't have time to calculate whether it is truly ten miles, after eating "ten scenic fried rice" in a Cantonese restaurant, I inadvertently discovered that the "char siu" was being deducted, and the owner was still "ten scenes, ten scenes"! Suddenly realizing that deceiving the world and stealing fame is beyond compare! This directly makes me doubt "ten."</p>
<p>"Ten" creates many, many obstacles to progress in our society, scattering countless seeds that sprout but do not bear fruit, believing that "ten" is completely beautiful and good. Marking "ten" and advancing, the advance is only slight, freezing "ten" under the potential power of the entire society, the most moderate of the moderate! If "Tang's inscription on the basin says: 'If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.'" has value, then this "ten" should be spurned. Unceasing self-improvement originally shouldn't have "ten" to seal the steps. Pull down the framework of the cross and leap forward, is this what we should strive for together?</p>
<p>"Crossroads," how can we allow shuffling again! Write about "ten" to criticize and expose ugliness.</p>
<h3 id="e70">From Chengdu to Xi'an <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>2. Is this the county seat?</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM, the bus departed from Mianyang and arrived in Zitong at 10:30 AM, stopping for lunch. Two days before departing from Chengdu, I happened to see a news article in the newspaper about the Executive Yuan commending the county magistrate of Zitong County. It said that the county magistrate was young and handsome, worked hard, and shortly after taking office, everything was well-organized, and he was specially commended by order. Now that I have arrived in Zitong County, I really don't know what kind of place this is. One street, dozens of old-style wooden shops. The people are poor, and their clothes are all tattered rags. The standard of living is also not low. Fried pork slices for lunch cost 5 jiao, egg flower soup costs 1 jiao, and rice costs 5 fen per bowl, which is also too coarse and black to eat. After lunch, we continued on our way, passing through Jiange County, Zhaohua County, and arrived at Guangyuan County at 10:00 PM. Unable to find a hotel, the bus drove into the warehouse of the train station, allowing passengers to move freely. Everyone was quite apprehensive. Some people took their luggage to find acquaintances or find hotels on their own. The remaining group sent two people who were more familiar with the local situation to find a hotel. They returned half an hour later and said they had found one. The bus drove to the entrance of that hotel. The name of the hotel was "Tongkang Inn". After moving the luggage into the inn and washing our faces, it was already 11:00 PM. I didn't feel hungry, but my heart was filled with a heavy sense of terror. Because for the entire fifteen hours, from getting on the bus to getting off the bus, it had been drizzling and a strong wind was blowing. I was wearing thin clothes, and my coat was completely soaked by the rain. Waves of cold were freezing my heart and lungs. My body was extremely weak. I had been seriously ill four years ago, and I still haven't fully recovered my spirit. If I were to be hit by the cold wind and rain, I would get a cold at best, and pneumonia at worst. Then this fragile life (although not a soldier) would be in a situation of "dying before achieving victory".</p>
<p>From Mianyang to Guangyuan, we passed through a total of four counties. The county seat of each county consists of two or three small streets, and the shops are all small wooden bungalows. There are no electric lights, no running water, few residents are literate, and there is absolutely no modern civilization. These county seats are only "prosperous" because they are located at important transportation hubs. Tongkang Inn has a couplet that says: "Read the passing guests from all over the world, be a hasty host for a day"; and on the lanterns at the entrance of another inn, it is written in red paint: "Do not stay at cockcrow". This fully shows the nature of these so-called county seats. If the county seats are like this, the primitive state of the countryside is imaginable, isn't it? I am a Southerner, and my hometown has the most overseas Chinese, and it is also praised by the Chinese as the richest county. Overseas Chinese brought Western civilization back very early, built railways, and opened up horse roads. The prosperity of the county seat is praised as Little Guangzhou; the towns have also opened up wide cement roads, and even in the countryside, two or three-story Western-style houses can be seen everywhere, and cars can directly reach the doorsteps of the villages. Having grown up in such a cradle, and having lived in capitalist cities like Shanghai and Hong Kong, I ask whenever I arrive in a county seat: Is this the county seat? And I lament that these places have not been baptized by Western culture.</p>
<p>Starting from Mianyang, we gradually entered the mountainous area. There are no vegetables or wheat on the mountains, nor are there any plants or trees. It is all a barren expanse of yellowish-brown. The height and barrenness of the place can be seen in general. In the territory of Jiange County, there is Jianmen Pass. A dozen towering mountain peaks stand tall and steep, with snow accumulated on the peaks, like silver pillars. On the north and south sides, there is only one pass, forming a herringbone shape. Although there have been no famous major battles fought here in the war history of our country, if there were a major battle fought here, it would definitely be a dangerous pass of "one man guards the pass, and ten thousand men cannot enter."

<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>The earth once again welcomes the vibrant return of spring.</p>
<p>Madam Li sat in the sunlight on the veranda, quietly knitting a wool sweater for her daughter. Four steel needles moved incessantly, emitting glints of reflected light. In the corner of the courtyard, a pear tree's buds had already begun to bloom, and small blades of grass were also stretching their heads out from the cracks in the paving stones.</p>
<p>The steel needles moved unceasingly, the wool sweater grew longer inch by inch, suddenly weaving a somber net before her eyes. This red expanse, faintly pulsating, seemed to symbolize red blood flowing from her heart! Madam Li deeply regretted choosing this joyful color.</p>
<p>With a "shush" sound, a cat darted straight out from behind the door and leaped onto the pear tree. Following closely, Xiao Ping emerged from the doorway, dragging a bamboo branch, chasing to the foot of the tree, and raising it to brandish it at the tree in a display of defiance. She was dressed in a tender green wool sweater, bulging and rounded. Madam Li sighed, placed the knitting on her lap, closed her eyes again, and called out, "Xiao Ping." Xiao Ping twisted her body, grunting in response, indicating her unwillingness to give up. The cat turned and jumped onto the wall behind the tree, leaping a few times onto the roof of the house behind.</p>
<p>Xiao Ping turned back in disappointment, craning her neck to look at the roof. The sun forced her to squint.</p>
<p>"Xiao Ping!" Hearing her mother call, Xiao Ping ran to her, leaned on her lap, and burst into tears. The child, feeling wronged by the cat, involuntarily shed tears. Madam Li quickly pushed her away, pulling out the half-knitted wool sweater. Several large, bean-sized teardrops glistened on the wool. Madam Li patted Xiao Ping's back, repeatedly saying:</p>
<p>"Don't cry, don't cry. Stand up and try it on for size!"</p>
<p>She pulled open the half-finished wool sweater, slipped it over Xiao Ping's head, and down to her belly. Xiao Ping wriggled, looking up, half-crying, half-laughing, said:</p>
<p>"When Dad sees it, he'll say 'Red Child, Red Child' again!"</p>
<p>"Is Red Child not good?" Madam Li said, while taking it off her.</p>
<p>"Mom, do you think Dad will come back after all? What's he doing there? Why is he always squatting at the end of the world and not coming back to see me?"</p>
<p>"He's fighting for us at the end of the world! Only when he's done fighting can he come back to see Xiao Ping!" Madam Li put away the yarn, held Xiao Ping on her lap with both hands, and looked at her wide-open eyes. Her own voice seemed unnatural, and she felt troubled. She leaned close and kissed Xiao Ping's tender cheek. Xiao Ping pushed her away with her little hand and asked in surprise:</p>
<p>"Mom, are you crying too? Tears are dripping on my face."</p>
<p>"Mommy is not crying, the tears are Xiao Ping's. Mommies are grown-ups, grown-ups don't cry." Madam Li truly couldn't hold back, and her throat felt especially constricted.</p>
<p>"Dad doesn't hit Xiao Ping, he hits bad people? Mom, when you write a letter, don't forget to ask Dad to buy a big foreign doll to bring back. Xiao Ping likes dolls the most." Xiao Ping bounced up and down on Madam Li's lap, one small hand groping Madam Li's face, the wet tears disappearing from her fingertips onto the back of her hand.</p>
<p>The sunlight had quietly slipped outside the veranda. The pear tree seemed to be smiling. Suddenly, the corner gate creaked open, and the head of a nurse poked in, her face full of smiles:</p>
<p>"Xiao Ping, hey!"</p>
<p>Xiao Ping turned her head, struggled to jump down, and ran towards her, opening her arms, calling:</p>
<p>"Auntie! Auntie!"</p>
<p>The aunt ran in, squatted down, picked up Xiao Ping, and walked along, kissing her cheeks again and again, smiling and saying:</p>
<p>"Sister, look, I'm pretending to be like this, and Xiao Ping is not afraid?" As she spoke, she twirled in front of her sister. Madam Li nodded, smiling, and said:</p>
<p>"Have you learned how to bandage? Are you still afraid of seeing blood?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? When have I ever been afraid of blood?" She sat down on a stool next to Madam Li, holding Xiao Ping, and bounced her high.</p>
<p>"You are not afraid of blood, but I hate this red. Red symbolizes blood. Knitting this red wool sweater is like a large patch of blood flowing from my chest!" Madam Li pulled out the unfinished wool sweater, shook it open, and waved it in front of her sister, "My heart can't bear to think of blood, but this thing keeps making me think of it. You still say it's a joyful color! I don't feel it when I'm sick myself, but when other people are sick, I can't see it, and that's exhausting! It feels like I always have something hanging on my heart, I can't grasp it, and I can't spit it out, I'm really suffering! I would rather go out and do something, let people worry about me, I really don't want to worry about people anymore! You are so carefree, jumping and running, doing your best for the country, and also venting your anger. I'm just sitting here, guarding, unable to do anything useful, watching you with empty envy."</p>
<p>"Alright, sister, you're unleashing that speech again," the sister laughed and took off her nurse's cap, "What does it mean to work in one's own position? If you want me to leave, then Xiao Ping won't have anyone." She really couldn't find any words to comfort her sister.</p>
<p>A hissing sound came from inside the window, it was the sound of the younger brother playing a record:</p>
<p>"...Arise, all who refuse to be slaves..."</p>

<p>— Simon</p>
<p>The indifferent night arrived, and the biting winter wind howled. Those streets, those roads brutally bombed during the day by iron crows emblazoned with sun emblems, lay beneath the gloomy sky without moon or stars. The desolate, shattered scene was even more desolate and shattered than after a storm. The shuddering and somber feeling it evoked was even more miserable and terrifying than the shuddering and somber feeling evoked by the most desolate countryside and the most deathly silent and gloomy ruined tombs in the depths of winter.</p>
<p>The streets were piled high with small hills of rubble fragments, brick wall fragments, scattered with broken, fragmented wooden pillars, beams, and flowered door panels. In addition, there were a few lonely, cracked walls, tottering precariously in the face of the gusts of wind. And there were unburied corpses, exposed here and there, whether they had lost an arm, a leg, their heads separated from their bodies, or only had half of their bloody bodies left... In short, those dead who still had recognizable faces all displayed an expression of resentment at being brutally murdered, making one's hair stand on end at the sight.</p>
<p>Apart from the whistling of the wind, occasionally, from a not-too-distant place, the cries of night vendors passed by, along with the "tuk-tuk" sound of clacking bamboo castanets. These had become the only sounds on the earth, but the miserable feeling was intensified by the encounter. At the other end of the street, those who had lost their homes huddled together, high and low, like beetles, curled up. Some went to the roadside to pick up grass stalks, paper balls, peanut shells, and other fuels. Gathering in front of the door of that family's grass shed dwelling, they piled up the things they had collected and lit a fire. As these things burned, they slowly blazed up, and the red flames rose higher and higher. A group huddled together, hissing air, snot dripping down their hands. Each frozen hand was stretched out and waved wildly above the firelight, desperately stroking and roasting.</p>
<p>Fire, fire, fire, burning, and then adding more things, the fire became more and more intense. The fire then curled up to the shed, and the shed caught fire.</p>
<p>Disaster. An intuitive alert. The people who had started the fire to keep warm all fled in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Very quickly, the fire spread to the grass sheds one by one. By the time the people in the houses noticed and ran out, their homes were already engulfed in a scorching fire pit.</p>
<p>The soaring red sparks obscured the entire space.</p>
<p>Under the illumination of the scarlet firelight: human voices were in turmoil, and footsteps were panicked. Strong men squinted and rushed out of their yards. Only when they got outside did they remember who was missing, and they desperately rushed back in to drag out a crying child. Some, wearing only single layers of clothing, were jumping around aimlessly as if they had lost something. Some old women fell on the roadside, spitting out half-frozen saliva. Some children couldn't find their mothers, and mothers couldn't find their children...</p>
<p>A cacophony of crying mingled with wailing, shouting, and yelling, mixed with the gushing sound of water spraying from the rubber hoses of the fire engines.</p>
<p>The more vigorously the north wind blew, the more the fire refused to subside. Moreover, fueled by the wind, it wildly and rampantly swept across the grass sheds, spreading forward wantonly. Firefighters wearing copper helmets, holding long iron shovels, taunted it, cutting off the houses about to catch fire to stop its progress. However, a gust of wind once again boosted its momentum, and it rolled up into the air, crackling and snapping as it devoured easily combustible things.</p>
<p>The screams and cries, along with the newly ignited fire, once again chaotically filled people's ears. Accompanied by the piercing sound of copper bells, the Red Cross ambulances were busiest, arriving with empty vehicles and leaving with a full load of people who had been burned by the fire.</p>
<p>The water in the street was overflowing.</p>
<p>The wind subsided slightly, and the flames gradually became tired. In the cold and gloomy night, many grass shed houses had become a scattered scorched earth. Then, despairing cries began: In the gloomy and cold night, the home was destroyed, the son was gone, buried in the fire; the wife was gone, taken to the Red Cross, injured. Everyone knew that. In the desolate and cold night, a pile of ashes, still flashing sparks of fire, contrasted with the pile of rubble at the other end of the street. Such an unfortunate and intense tragedy was tormenting the poor, peaceful people!</p>
<p>Likewise, the home was gone. For now, they would spend the night at the corner of the street in December. But where would they go tomorrow? And what about the long days after tomorrow?</p>
