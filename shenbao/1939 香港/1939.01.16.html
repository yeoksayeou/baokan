<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">期望五中全會 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>中國國民黨第四屆中央執行委員第五次全體大會，簡稱五中全會，頃據淪電，確定於本月二十日，在重慶開慕，距今蓋祗五天。按之國民黨總章，中委全會之於黨內，乃為僅次於全國代表大會之機構，每六個月始召集一次，會址必在中央政府所在地；是其本質與權限之重大，無待贅言。尤以國政黨治，所繫復非一黨黨內之事；近二十年來之黨國大計，悉淵源於此。况在非常時期，抗戰建國，千端萬緒，瞻前顧後，繼往開來：或待探討，或待力行，動輒有關黨國前途：是以此次之五中全會，固非曩昔每半年例會之比也。五中全會之議案議程，局外無從預聞；卽待决之最重要主題，亦未若歷屆全會之先得覘知之於中央常務執行委員會之决議；主要議題旣迄今未經透露，記者卽無自而就事論事。雖然，有若干事態，為吾人居常所深感未安，茲請約略陳之。愚者千慮，容有一得歟！</p>
<p>國民黨自經去歲臨時全國代表大會之决定而取總裁制，黨內外翕然稱頌；誠以權力自此集中，意志自此統一，以組織之强健，卜事功之猛進，然時日荏苒，成績之表見無多覯；是無他，戰時以軍事為主，不遑為黨致全力，卽有所致力，雖成就甚宏，亦為戰事所掩而非盡人聞知；此由主觀與客觀兩因，當然成績不克如所預期。今後大局入於嚴重之階段，吾人仍應體認緩急重輕，未宜責備求全。顧在中央委員方面言之，却有不可實己太寬者。原中央委員在黨內之地位，不因總裁制而損其崇高；在黨政或在社會之服務，不因戰時以軍事為主而貶為附庸：抑且在恰如其分之自尊觀念上，與天下匹夫之責任觀念上，對黨對國對社會，乃至對所掌職守，應有法式總裁精神，而較一般黨員曁人民，作千百倍其刻苦淬勵之自覺。庶幾總裁為全國所心悅誠服，奉為唯一領袖之外，中央委員亦於精神方面之種種，確示一般黨員與人民以不凡；要知任何組織之能維繫不朽，在乎中堅分子形成優良傳統之規樣，而不能永永依賴之於任何個人。國民黨得總裁，而為之中堅分子之中央委員，則有待奮發者尙多；竊以為國民黨在政治上之前途，端視黨內中央委員之如何為黨創建以完成屹立不拔之根基；中堅不如人則前途不如人，所虞在己而不在人。人民屬望於國民黨者獨厚，國民黨亟應有實際事績適應人民厚望之道，此一也。國民黨夙以革命精神，立黨建國，然最近十年，革命精神寖衰矣。有關國政者姑勿論，就黨言之，如規畫黨內之組織，推行實踐黨之主義與政策，制裁黨內一切之黨紀，遴任中央地方各級職員之人選，在在發見革命精神之不澈底；往往轟轟烈烈，以雷霆萬鈞之力，發動於前，卒埋沒于忽明忽昧之中。論情衡事，當然其中必有不得已之苦衷，為黨內所共諒；然觀感所繫，影響所及，與其事功效能之所不足，則不盡能取諒于人民。究其結癥，事非一格，殊無例舉必要；然保持廓然大公之態度，芟除不必要之瓜葛與掣制，將原有之革命精神發揮而光大之，要為根治之道；此二也。此次抗戰，在國族對內對外之種種方面說明之，無不富有革故鼎新之意義；卽如社會之各種事業，與任何個人之立身立業，亦將以抗戰而遭逢嚴重之測驗，發生强烈之變化；此乃趨勢使然，殆難避免；行見優秀者當得合理之發展，腐朽者將受合　之淘汰。若使其間更加以人工，則最後之歸宿雖大體不能違反趨勢，然所造就之過渡現象則必視人工當否而殊觀。針對此項偉大之動態，謀國者應認識明確，因勢而利導之。易辭申言之，務加工力，而使一切興革成敗沈浮利鈍，極公道，極經濟，極分明。工力而得當，可以短縮完成建國大業之過程，反之，徒增魔障；此其影響遠大，蓋有不可言語形容者，然登高自卑，行遠自邇，一切發端，卽在今茲。是以今茲謀黨謀國，至少必須檢討實現、對人對事之不公道，不經濟，不分明者，務作無情之徘除；能作無情之排除，始得合理之辦法；此三也。此三者，五中全會其三致意之乎！</p>
<h3 id="c2">華北抗戰槪況與今後形勢估計（二） <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 彭德懷講于嗚鳳記</p>
<p>（續昨日本報第六版）</p>
<p>這佔我民族半數的女同胞、如不注意努力發動和組織起來、這偉大的力量的損失、將是一件如何痛惜的事、而且，不能吸引這一偉大力量到抗日陣綫中來、不特是我們抗日民族解放中的損失、反而要增　抗戰中許多不必要的困難、如動員兵役便是一個很顯明的例子，如能對婦女組織起來、加以宣傳和敎育、使她們曉得抗日戰爭不勝利、卽她們將永久遭受壓迫和××、必須提醒她們鼓勸丈夫和兒子去富兵、以及參加　種抗戰工、帮助軍隊和政府抗戰、這個道理、是非常簡單而又明顯、然而今天確實尚有人存着不確的視念、蔑視婦女、把婦女當作「貨品」、其實，要知道這佔半數的人不得解放、即抗日勝利、中華民挨也不算眞正的全民族的解放的、</p>
<p>（二）婦女工作的中心：</p>
<p>仍然是以抗日為第一、只有民族的解放、才能爭取婦女切身的要求與解放、只有抓住抗日的中心、才能求得婦女本身的實際利益、但這並不是忽視婦女的切身迫切要求、而是婦女解放和民族解放的共同一條道路、</p>
<p>（三）婦女對抗戰的積極表現：</p>
<p>婦女在華北抗戰中間、有着英勇壯烈的事蹟、給那些主張婦女『到家庭去」、和『囘到廚房去』的侮辱者以嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>在華北特殊環境當中、傷兵不能集中、多半分散在農民家中、婦女對傷兵的愛　、眞是無微不至、把她　換油鹽植蓄起來的鷄蛋、那送　傷兵吃、而自己情願不吃油不吃　、大家不要以為一個鷄蛋算不了什麽事情、而一位農民婦女、却是把鷄蛋看得非常寶貴的、她們能把鷄蛋情願拿出來送給傷兵吃、這是多麽令人感動、其次、她們鼓動自己的丈夫和兒子送至抗日車隊中去當兵、做鞋子、襪子、手套、慰勞抗日軍人、紡紗、織布、縫軍衣、供給軍隊、參加農業生產、鋤田割麥、都努力去做、華北去年糧食大增、得婦女之力不少、特別是動員兵役，壯了補充、實在是一件大事、値得表揚的婦女功續、</p>
<p>（四）婦女工作的經驗：</p>
<p>（a）以抗日為中心、一切為了抗日、一切服從抗日，</p>
<p>（6）首先吸收開明家庭品行良好的婦女、知識份子、加以訓練、敎育、但須注意到中國民族許多歷史的特殊習慣、以免妨害工作、</p>
<p>（c）調練後回家底及鄉村、不是挑超婦女反抗的意識、而是特別的和　、在各方面起積極模範作用、影響男人小孩子使其進步、引起鄰里鄉黨家庭人士的敬佩、提高婦女地位、所以現在華北各地有許多玄子被選舉為村長區長、參加政治活動、</p>
<p>（d）培養婦女工作能力、提高女子智識、不騙傲、態度和平、不特堅苦的做婦女工　、而且要做落後男子的工作、只有這樣、才能打破輕視女子的惡習愼、</p>
<p>（卯）兒童抗日工作：</p>
<p>（1）兒童救亡組織、在華北有相當的普遍、在晉冀察邊區、平漢以西、正太以南等地邸有、</p>
<p>（2）敎育兒童、提高民族意識、做抗日工作、提高文化程度、發動識宇兒童帮助不識字者、參加歌詠演講工作、鼓吹抗戰、</p>
<p>（3）兒童担任的工作、除宣傳敎育外、檢查路條、盤查行人、偵察可疑行人、慰問抗日軍人家屬、破獲×人漢奸放毒的陰謀、（在八路軍總司令部門前、便有一兒童抓獲一個放毒於井者的漢奸、）</p>
<p>（4）兒童本身、有敎育訓練、開會討論、自我批評，使他們取鍊成一個三民主義新國家的兒童、</p>
<p>（辰）抗日軍人家屬工作；。</p>
<p>抗日軍人家屬工作、非常萬要，在華北、對這個工作也特別注意、</p>
<p>（1）組織「抗日軍人家屬委員會』、以一鄉或鄰近數鄉為單位、選出委員、規定會期、每星期一次、會讓中藉以聯絡和討論問題，解决抗屬困難和需要、進行敎育與宣傳、發動家屬寫信安慰前線戰士、努力戰門、</p>
<p>（2）提高抗屬在社會上及政治上的地位、開會時請其當主席在羣衆中　揚他、發動社會團體慰勞和帮助、精神上給以取勵、物質上有具　帮助、如；帮助耕田、收割、借貸、縣長或其他行政長官、贈送光　牌，　自去慰問等、</p>
<p>（3）抗屬享有各種「優先權』、子女讀書免費、合作社減價購物、和必要的經濟、</p>
<p>這些、都是為了戰爭的勝和、正確的實際的打擊了過去「好兒不當兵、好鐵不打釘」的觀念、</p>
<p>（4）進行抗屬敎育、使其不騙傲、在羣衆中起模範作用、得到羣衆更多的愛護與帮助、同時、這敎育、幷不是空洞訓話、而是把他們自己組織起來，開會討論和批評、羣衆敎育羣衆、</p>
<p>只有這樣、才能使軍民台作更進一步、使民衆認為軍隊是我們的軍隊、軍隊成為民衆的武力、否則、空口叫喊、一切無效、</p>
<p>（已）對民衆宣傳敎育工作：</p>
<p>（1）宣傳敎育的目的、最低限度是以提高抗戰情緒為目的、</p>
<p>（2）宣傳敎育的敎材、把三民主義，抗戰建國綱領、蔣委員長重要。言、抗戰十八個月的硜臉敎訓、抗戰中的央勇事實、都可通俗的編為敎材、然後、進行艱苦的、有計劃的工作、用各權方式敎育他們、</p>
<p>（3）敎育的組織、除一般小學校外、以鄉村為單位、組織婦女識字班、貧民識字班、或夜學等、其次、也有以鄉村為單位、組織救亡室、民挨革命室、民族復興室等等、指定適當人員負責、領導民衆開討論會、報吿各地戰况、講解民族英雄故事事業、（如孫總理中山先生革命事蹟與中張岳飛和秦檜有什麽不同等，）舉辦抗日畫報、情報、隨時予民衆以學習機會，另外、也可以組織座談會、把知識份子組織起來、對論具體工作、進行民衆敎育、</p>
<p>（4）對落後份子的敎育，比較困難、需要耐心地道行、以期爭取廣大的羣衆到抗日陣綫上來、</p>
<p>（午）民運工作的經驗驗：</p>
<p>（1）要有廣泛的民主、才能發動民衆、組織民衆、民衆的事要　民衆自己　，　領導工作的人、誰也不能忘記這個、要　從民衆的意見、帮助他們、不是「包辦』、妨礙了他們的自覺性和責任心、倘若沒有這個制度和作風、一切包辦命令、必然會遭到失敗</p>
<p>（2）不要滿足於空洞計劃與號召、計劃是一件事、拿到羣衆中實現又是一件事、二者之間的距離尙遠、要想計劃成為實際行動、必須要切實努力於艱苦工作、耐心的深入的去做一點一滴的羣衆工作、才能達到目的、</p>
<p>（3）體切羣衆切身要求、替羣衆解决每一具規問題、實際的問題能得到解决、羣衆工作自然能獲得成就、否則、空頭支票、不能兌現、必然歸於失敗，</p>
<p>（4）要注意培　提拔各種社會職業團體自已的幹部、只有這些幹部、才能深切了解他們急切要求、適於生活習慣、相互關係可以密切、否則、從上委派、格格不入、自然工作不能有听成功了、</p>
<p>（5）做羣衆工作的幹部、無論何黨何派的人、必需深人羣衆、盧心的在羣衆中學習、了解他們具體的問題、站在羣業裏面、來領導羣衆前進、倘若高高在上、目擺官架子、結果將一定失敗、</p>
<p>以上各節、都是講到民運工作、我們所以先講民衆、卽是認為抗戰建國全靠民衆、倘若不相信民衆、看不起民衆、工作的方式還不變更、那末、我可以肯定的說、抗日會遇更多困難甚至不利、今天動員民衆、組織民衆，完全是為了抗日、要達到抗日勝利的目的、一定要發動民衆、組織民衆、才是正確的可靠的辦法、</p>
<p>乙、反漢奸及與×偽軍門爭</p>
<p>反漢奸是使中國人不打中國人、瓦解×　軍便是破壞×人、削弱×人、</p>
<p>Ａ漢奸在日×指使下活動的情形</p>
<p>（a）以抗日口號的外衣進行偽組織、如「××救國軍』、「抗日軍』等便是、因為　衆對日×仇恨甚，如今然組織「皇協軍」一定遭到民衆　反對、所以他們便利用『抗日』口號、來招搖欺騙、等到把羣衆吸收祖織起來、他們即　為「自衛』、提出的口號是『日本兵不打咱們、咱們不打日本兵』、又是「咱們軍隊打日本兵打不倒、用以自衛、日本兵不來、咱們不打日本？，』　後者受其騙、隨聲附和、於是進而提出、『咱們不讓日本以來、也不讓中國兵來、』這樣日×即達到目的、由於漢奸的欺、便利了日軍的兵力不足分配、進而中國軍隊來也要　了、這更達到日×『中國人打中國人』的目白、其動接民衆抗日决心、破壞中國抗日力量之毒　、由此可知、另外、也有弟兄二人、一為抗日軍、一為皇協軍、抗日軍勝利了、哥哥保護弟弟，抗日失敗了、弟弟保護哥崗、幷且還有的漢奸、取得中日變方委派、有青天白日旗、也有太陽旗、日本軍來了、打起太陽旗、中國軍來了、打起靑大白日旗、　些事實、在冀南的楊玉昆便是一個例子、聽起來使人非常痛心、而實際上、這些把戲還容易迷惑民衆、受其欺騙、</p>
<p>（b）利用封建迷信組織、如紅槍會、陸議會、白槍會等組織、都是號稱自衛，其實幫助日×、</p>
<p>（c）日×最近在華　提出以部份的和平達到整個和平妥協的口號、與民衆訂立互不侵犯條約、以補救其兵力不够分配的困難、他說、日本軍隊不搶、不張姦、不燒房子、但亦須老百姓保證中央軍、八路軍不打日本軍、於是他可以用少數部隊守衛一個地方（如一聯隊減為一排一連、）同時、日×最近提出所謂『三分軍事、七分政治、』來欺騙落後民衆、最近更無恥的提出什麽「打囘祖國去」、實現孫總理「亞細亞主義』之類口號、</p>
<p>（d）挑撥離間、破壞團結、散佈和平空氣、企圖消失我國民衆反抗情緒、動、誘惑，慫恿老百姓打倒抗日軍、有許多地方、偽皇協軍帶上八路軍的微章、貼標語、建立「蘇維埃」、實行土地革命、無產階級專政、以破壞八路軍和民衆的感情、也有時候、遇　中央軍、說專打共產軍、不打中央軍、遇到游擊隊、說專打止規軍、不打游擊隊、而遇到正規軍、却又說專打游擊隊、華北軍隊及民衆對×言些陰　、一般　有了進一步認識、但還有少數人認識模糊、需要耐心的解釋、</p>
<p>B我們的對策</p>
<p>×人這樣地玩弄其鬼計、企圖破壞我抗戰、那末、我們怎樣對付呢、</p>
<p>（a）提高人民的民族自尊心、和抗戰勝利的信心、以及克服困難的毅力、的確、我們過去是在帝國主義侵略下、减低了民族自尊心和自信心、自己侮辱自己、說什麽「東亞病夫』、『劣等民族』、以為自己不行、具實、我們中華民挨是人類世界的優秀民族、有許多優秀的事蹟、値得誇　以之敎育民衆的、十八個月抗戰的經驗和敎訓、也足以提高民族自信心，來增强克服困難之毅力、同時、必須要善於抓緊每一具體事實、揭發×人漢好陰謀和挑撥離間、以造成人民對漢奸日×的仇恨、這樣、我們在華北、使×人無所施展、北平為臨時政府的命令、只能達到頤和園附近、其他各地、則無法達到而且也無效、（未完）</p>

<p>— 本報重慶特約航訊</p>
<p>廣州武漢失陷以後、華中華南戰局、一時顯現沉寂、×人以疲敝之師、在華中被我阻擊於岳陽通城一線、在華南與我相峙於三水從化等處、遲遲不得前進、但是、×人是不會　止他軍事淮攻的、故在華中華南進犯不逞以後、又將具　攻的目標、首先轉向於西北、</p>
<p>西北是我們進行華北抗戰的重要支點、×人一年餘來、均已屢次企圖渡河西犯、但坐因我陝東河防鞏固、晉中我軍堅强抵抗、不備使一人在晉東南及五台等處的掃蕩計劃趨受粉碎、而且使×人渡河犯陝的企圖、亦愛成了一場泡影、</p>
<p>不過、×人雖然慶受重創、惟是渡河企圖、仍未放棄、不但未放棄、反而由於我兩北軍事穩定、更　×人希圖要加速實現其狂妄的計劃、從上月中旬以來、×在同浦南段、集結大軍、總數　二萬論人、分五路積極西犯、一路以汾陽孝　為根據、由兌九谷麥郊、北趨石樓新閡渡、南趨隰縣、一路以臨汾為根據、由士門里龍關、進犯蒲　大寧、一路由襄陵西犯、幷北折趨黑龍關、一路以曲沃候馬新絳為根據、北佔泉掌三　等地、圖趨禹門、一以河津為根據、以主力進攻禹門、竊×人主要企圖、顯然在以主力西　、希　覓取渡河　進犯陝東、</p>
<p>自上月二、五日起我×在晋西方面、卽已展開劇烈戰鬭、×人力求速進、先後陷我蒲縣、大　、鄉寧、吉　、石樓等處，但是在黃河兩屋，我軍早有嚴密配備、晋陝之戰、黃河千里、所有　要渡口、我亦已有嚴密戒備、故×人難一度進佔　禹門等處、但均被我軍給與迎頭痛擊、幷將禹門船窩師家灘等處收復、同時、在會西我廣大游擊隊異常沽躍、而軍民關係亦極良好、×人冒險西犯，雖然一時僥倖得逞、但是、我軍運用新戰略、、僅注意於正面的堵擊、幷且更注意於在　　的後側翼合與重人打擊、×人要求加速西進、而我軍則在×人後側、自南北加以夾擊、結果同時幷以廣汎的游擊隊截斷其後方交通線、使×人首尾不能　顧、×人要前進、則其後路受打擊、要　後路的安全、則不能不停止他的前進、因而我軍於八日克復吉　，大甯、殲×四千餘人、十日克復蒲縣；鄉甯、殲×三千餘人，同時幷乘勝收復午城鎭、幷攻人離右城、使×人受重大打擊、狼狽萬分、就日前晉西形勢而論、我軍顯然取得大的勝、利此種　利、實在是由於正規軍與游擊部隊巧妙的配合、軍隊與民衆廣汎的動員、戰略之滴宜運用、以及我前線無數健兒英勇　鬭的結果，</p>
<p>然而日前的小勝　、我們絕不能以此目驕、×人對晉西的　攻、現在還只是一個開始、不久的將來、在西北戰塲上、×人顯然還要加緊他的進攻、而晉西戰局形勢、也必然會更加的緊張、因為這樣、自然更加　了我們保衛西北的任務、</p>
<p>要保衛西北。必須加　山西的　　，山　是陜甘寧靑的前　、　是華北抗戰的重要篠點，目前×人之所以不敢冒險渡河西犯、幷不是他沒有渡河的力，，而是由於我們在山西還控制有人量的軍力、使他不能不有所顧慮、因此、現在西保陜甘　　、就必員加强山西的戰灣、要加强×人後方的政治工作游擊隊、改　軍民關係、同時更要加强國內的團結、這一點在西北更是特別的重要、</p>

<p>不大理人的四川茶房，將記者名片投人後，吳先生就跑出門外，把記者請到裏邊，房間主人是李高兩先生，見記者定進，都笑容可掬，記者問矣先生安　，開始扯談起來。</p>
<p>吳先生那雙和善的三角眼，令人可　，他對於重慶的感想，祗　橘子很使宜。談到國除問題，他說　首相張伯倫，聰明利害，好像者於打太極峯的，輿艾登　配合搭檔，表面上說英國不敢衝撞人，打人不過，實際上　登輩大肆活動，張俏倫要結聯失國，而又××××，無非是用的　將方法。</p>
<p>記者問他劃於在精衛先生出走後的感想，吳先生說：汪先生叛黨猶可恕，叛國則不可恕。在先生這個人血壓太高，常常會發神經病，可是遭次的神經病眞　不得。年前决定抗戰，汪先生也是當局者，今日居然叛變上令人理解不到。記者向他外傳在先生要到上海去開五　大會，眞不眞？吳先生說：汪先生這種事情都做得出，還有什麽事情做不出，不　刻上海，他也許到南車。然而任先生一離開申央。已不廈要，價期頗中的湯魚和，王克　之流，本也可　演正劇，但是偽組織一切不　定，汪先生又有什麽辦　呢！</p>
<p>記者繼問吳先生外傳本月廿日召開的五中　會，其中重要的議案，可以吿知一二否？吳氏　九中全會大約本月十五左右召開（以下一段略去）</p>

<p>— 陶釬知</p>
<p>我這次到廣西，喝過幾林最美的葡萄酒，隨便那一國的也日不上他。但是我所帶來的不是葡萄酒而是比葡萄酒還要好的禮物。這禮物便是廣西的新精神和這種新精神所能發揮　來的力量。</p>
<p>我未到廣西去之前，見　廣西兩位領袖，知道了兩件事。</p>
<p>在第五戰區的××司令部，正常十架×機飛過之後，我問李宗仁司令長官：廣西　了多　兵？他　四十萬。我當時算了一算說，廣西只有一千三白萬人口，已經出了四十萬兵，假如各省都像廣西，照全國四萬萬五千萬人口推算起來，我們該有一千四百高兵保衛國家，不但是武漢不必放棄血目南京也未必失守。李司令長官說，我也這樣想。</p>
<p>白副參謀總長崇禧，在東湖療醫院裏扶病接見我兩次，都是討論全面戰術。這是他對于第二期抗戰所創的特殊名詞。他說：全面戰術是擊戰·運動戰·陣地戰的綜合戰術。他提出兩句扼，要的精義：（一）積　勝為大勝；（二）拿空間換時間．我承他　敎之後，也提出全面敎育來商榷，他也以為必須有全面敎育，才能配台全面抗　的需要，以爭取金面的勝利。</p>
<p>我是十一月廿一日到桂林，十二月二十三離開龍州，在　西境內，我所要報吿的是這　二天的印象。在這個時期內有中國大轉機的衛山會議。我在桂省　親眼看見僛由會　的的廣西和銜山會　後的廣西。我親眼看見廣西在這大轉機中活躍起來。</p>
<p>衝山會議之後·蔣委員長以及重要的將領，先後都到了桂林。白　禧將軍先到。桂林在十二月底已經是很冷，白將軍是帶了冬天的太陽來。他首先把蔣委員長仕衛山出的幾條方針，如政治重子軍事，民衆重于兵，後方重于前方，游擊戰重干陣地戰，吿訴我們。我們當時是多末為中華民國慶幸　？軍事委員會政治部副部　周恩來先生來了。他把衡由決定的游　區的軍事政治文化一矛化的方　吿訴我，並說：照這个方　實行出去，可以免去一切磨　，足以　破為政機，而給日軍一个致命的打擊。後來第　戰區司令長官兼軍事委員會政治部長陳誠將軍也來了。他和我　面就說。現在我們有了標準了。政治部成績好壞，就看軍隊好壞，而軍隊好壞就看老百姓與論如何而定。老百姓說某某軍隊好，那是真的好；老百姓說某某軍隊壞，那是真的壞。其次又吿訴我政治部的新口號：宣傳卽敎　：服務卽宣傳。對　為老百姓服務才是眞正的宣傳。這樣一來那些宣傳八股是用不着了。</p>
<p>廣西是在這些新的思想的和諧中，大步闊步的邁進。廣西是要雷厲風行的把這些思想，變成力　來保衛大西南，以保衛、中華。在這個大轉機當中，我們首先看見是西政治趨向民主化。廣西最下層的組織，村街民大會，那　早已有了。現在正忙着成立鄉鎭民代表會，和縣臨時參議會。等到　臨時參議會成立以後，即循序而成立省參議。這件大事是在黃旭初主席領導之下奮勇進行。民政廳長雷股先生；對我說：國無民則不國，民無組織，則有民，于無民。我們要救國，一定要　人民組織起來。不但是廣西要人民的組織，全國的人民，部要快快的組織起來。我們可以說，廣西的政治機構，是向着民主化如進。</p>
<p>廣西的政治運用，是　靈敏的。十一月用日大轟炸後，兩小時內便把救，難民的辦法，徧貼亦四城，子何處可住，何處可　振欵，都　佈出來了。有親戚的可投親戚去暫住。如果　戚　絕，則被難者可以控吿親戚。互助　急不是抽象的這德而是法定的行為。避空襲時遇着老幼　道靑年人有讓路　帮助負擔之義務。這也要成為不成文　。</p>
<p>疏散人口，最近是成了一種要政。政府把路懷疑，特跟去看了幾處，果然如吿示所說，這才由懷疑而為欽佩。</p>
<p>說到軍事，廣州失守的時候，廣西是有些空處。白將軍到來，一面移調生力軍，一面訓練新兵，一面普遍的組織　擊隊，到我離開的時候，廣西已經是很穩固了。我從桂林經過荔浦，榴江·柳州·蘆墟·南寧·龍州·而到鎭南關·每天天才天亮都看見或是聽見　丁出揀。最近他們都是操練怎樣打游擊。據說截　我　開龍州之時為止，可以打擊的戰士是有了五十萬以上而且人數是繼續不斷的增加。這些正在操練的戰士，是老等着日本軍隊來，有。是等得不耐煩，要　衝到廣東去帮　。日本軍閥不怕鼻子碰破，可以到廣西來試一試。（未完）</p>

<p>國聯行政院會、定于十六日在日內瓦開會、這次會議有一個重要議題。就是援助中國制裁。本的提案，</p>
<p>上屆國聯會議；會因我國鄭重呼籲；卒得全體一致决議，援引盟約十六條，實施援助我國抵抗日平侵略，雖然這一决議，未能立卽發生電大作用，然而其後我國在國際形勢日超好轉，而日本則日陷似立、這是不容否認旣成的事實。</p>
<p>我　所以能在上屆會議中獲勝，有賴於我國代表之英勇奮鬥與國聯正義人士如蘇聯代表之熱烈　護，但主要的，第一是日本在遠東發展直接威脅到歐洲各國尤其是英國的利益，第二是中國團結一致抗戰不屈的英男表現，聲强了列强援助我國的信心。</p>
<p>但是過去各國援華制日，無論如何，是不够積極的，其所助於華者不啻杯水車薪，而所以制日者迄無具體表現。</p>
<p>所以我們在這次國聯大會中，不僅應該爭取各國更切實更廣泛的援助，特別是財政，醫藥，軍火，軍事原料，技術人材等等，更應力爭實現各國切實制裁日×，尤其是抵貨，索債，停止軍火及軍事原料輸日等等。因為唯有這樣，才能使日×受威脅，中止侵略、設竟冒險蠻幹，亦必更快地趨於崩潰。這是正義人類共同的要求，也是國聯維護世界和平的天職。</p>
<p>由於日本今後對外政策的更加橫蠻，更加與歐美列强嚴重對立；由於我國團結抗戰的更加堅强，更加增高歐美列强對我的信心；再由於最近美國積極反對侵略的表示、英美互相接近的趨勢、，及羅馬會談失敗後英法更趨合作的表現；我們深信：我們上述緊念要求、是有實現可能的。</p>
<p>我們現在一方面希望我國代表更英勇的為人類正義祖國光榮而奮團，另一方面更應該實行國內外輿論界總動員，實行國民外交、用種種有效方法。督促國聯通過我們這次嚴正迫急的要求。</p>

<p>在國際形勢逐漸好轉的時候，在和平民主陣線再趨鞏固與發展的時候、法西期侵略陣線內部危機的暴露，並不是意外的。不過我們要注意希特勒等法西斯獨裁者對於這種內部　突，以辛普遍劇烈的內部羣衆反對運動，用什麽方法去解决呢？沒有別的。只有加緊他們對外戰爭。希特勒如此，墨索里尼如此，日本軍閥也英不如此。因此，我們需要加强侵略者國內反法西斯人民陣線，需要更積極和廣泛地組織全世界正義和平人士的反法西斯反侵略運動。</p>

<p>— 斐如</p>
<p>日本當局昨日竟向笑聯社記者宣稱：『日方巳準備與蘇聯斷絕外交關係，除非蘇聯允許日方所提改善漁約之要求』。蘇日漁約問題，在最近蘇日兩國的關係上、投下了暗影，經我們一再檢討過（參閱本報十二月二十三日『蘇日漁糾紛的發展』）。其必　成蘇日國交的最嚴重問題發生的導火線，早花我們論斷之中。現在日本侵略者意欲藉此問留蠻幹，是値得我們特別注意的。</p>
<p>關於漁約的糾紛，演變到目前的階段，算是結束了口頭及文件的往還磋商，而進到以實際行動來表示態度和决心的時候了。蘇日漁約本約及附約的期間，皆於去年滿期，因為雙方幾次談判破裂的結果，蘇日漁業的問題已成無條約狀態。在停止捕魚期間，沒有條約還不要緊，但到捕魚時期，這一問題，就會極端嚴重化，考察蘇日兩方所持的爭點及其談判的經過情形，蘇日漁的要得到圓滿的結果，是很困難的，這個問題到春季捕魚開始的時傷，將演變出如何事情，是任何人所不能預料的，但是其社向總視國際情形的轉變以為斷，對於昨日日方對記者的談話，我們的認識約有下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）日本軍政當局的這種談話，帶有很激烈的恫嚇臭味，日本侵略者，素來即慣用這種技倆處理國際問題，以期不投資本而得到厚利，對於中國幾次歷史的大收獲，大部分出於這種恫嚇的成效．所以日軍當局又任『相信蘇聯决不敢因此動武』的餿想下，大放厭論，但是恫嚇之能發生效果，須以怯弱者為對象，倘若對方是個强硬者，那末日卒紙老虎立刻就會畏縮；去，我國「八一三」以來的英武抗戰，巳給了侵略者以進退維谷的環境，去年張鼓峯事件，蘇聯也給與它以更深切的敎訓。在蘇聯準備還給侵略者「兩倍或三倍以上的打擊一的今日，日本軍閥的恫嚇，將完全失其效用。</p>
<p>（二）日本侵略者準備進攻蘇聯的手勢將更進一步，日本之包圍蘇聯，完全採取德，日東西夾攻的作法、它所以敢向蘇聯挑戰，也就是因為有德，，意在西方為它響廳，日本軍方認為：「蘇聯正與德國在烏克蘭方面發生衝突，故穌方决不敢與日方發生更大的糾紛』，不是沒有理由的·但是日本侵略者的這一如意算盤又是打錯了，我們的論据是：（一）蘇聯的軍備的完備，是足以應付東西兩侵略者的淮攻的；（二）德國在西方也　無數的勁敵，如英法决不能長此讓德國坐大；（三德國國內政治，經濟明困難·嚴格限制着希特勒疋出『以威嚇取勝』的圈外，伯是烏克蘭决不是　克，不能以恫嚇取得，這樣一來，日本的默洲犄角就完全失去效用。</p>
<p>（三）日本軍政當局的這　恐嚇。在目前恐怕還不敢率然出以實際的行動；究　用意仍不外乎三種目的：其一，是移轉國內視聽於對外問題上，緩和目前的內部糾紛，造成强制議會通過龐大的預算案。及總動員法實施法案的口實；其二，是欺騙英美法各民主國家。使她們對日的制裁緩相，以收離間蘇聯與英美法更加堅固的合作；其三。是淆混我國的正確認識，以與所製造的漢奸理論相呼應，分化我們的抗戰力量。</p>
<p>（四）蘇日糾紛程度將與日而供增進。即令『在捕魚季節開始時，斷絕外交關係，未必卽於四月初實現』，但其糾紛將演至局部的實際衝突，是有可能的、日本聲稱：『若漁　未能有所改善，卽將以武力保護漁民北進取魚』，旧在蘇聯則不但漁約不能如日方所希望加以修改，並目要收回四十個軍事漁區。再加以日本目前攻略中國的方向　中到西北，我們又積極準備强大的軍力迎擊×人，則西北方面此後的鬥爭，將　於激烈，西北與蘇聯　係密切，最近中蘇關係又在日益進展，蘇聯帮助中國抗戰將更積極，所以蘇日的糾紛，將與中日戰爭漸漸聯結在一起，日本眞正與蘇聯斷絕國交，到那時候就實現了。</p>
<p>且看日本侵略者除手勢恐嚇外，還再來些什麽把戲？</p>

<h3 id="c43">戲劇歌詠大會 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>為的是籌建公共圖書館</p>
<p>在九龍才誕生二僩多月的中華業餘學校，昨天上午十時，在平安戲院舉行戲劇歌詠大會，為的是籌建公共圖書館。</p>
<p>陶行知先生在該會特刊中說及他「從前在曉在辦了一個圖書館，叫做「書獃子莫來館」。但是，一方面叫書獃子不要來，一方面為什麽又要辦圖書館呢？要叫「工獃子」「錢獃子」多看些書，把頭腦弄淸楚一點，好把世界的事看個明白。但書是一種工具。……是為着用，一為着解决問題。斷不可獃讀。認淸這一點，書是最好的東西，有好書，我們就受用無窮了。」</p>
<p>從這裏，我們可以窺見該校這次籌建公共圖書館的旨趣是任提倡供應大衆的精神食糧；在遍處銅臭，錢獃子塞道的香港社會，分明是十二分需要的義舉</p>
<p>平安戲院是相當堂皇的；在明滅燈光掩映之卜，來得竟加優美，靜寂。主席致詞的時候，圓形的廣大會塲，充滿着嚴　的空氣。</p>
<p>歌詠開始，序幕是國歌。樓上樓下合共一千八百餘人都肅然站立，雄壯的歌聲就激盪着全院的空間，震動着廣大觀衆的心弦。</p>
<p>音調拍子，在技術方面是相當成功的，而最美的地方，還是該團四十幾個精神砲滿的男女靑年身上那一套藍布長褂與土布學生裝。整潔，撲素的風度，在集體中越顯示出大方的美。這種眞實，自然的美，不消說，在香港是値得提倡的。</p>
<p>接續下去的歌詠：是靑天白日滿地紅，國旗歌，七七進行曲，怒吼，奮起救團，保衛中華·為國爭光，赴×，救國歌，衝鋒號，凱旋等名曲。「保衛中華」的高低合唱，配台着悠揚的音樂，」格外感動人們的心肺。</p>
<p>這次大家欣賞歌詠之美，不僅是用耳朶聽，而且用眼嚴釘住待刊裏的歌詞，格外掀起了一陣陣的心潮。</p>
<p>歌詠之後就是戲劇，第一幕是該校自編的「新武訓興義學」，在意義方面是很需要的敎育劇。可是，在故事的穿插方面缺乏「藝術的趣味」：所以嫌其太硬性。聽不貫國語的觀衆更覺乏味。</p>
<p>第一幕是「閘北八百壯士」表演得很緊張，恨生動，廣州話亦容易吸引全場的注意。劇情的表現是偉大壯烈的抗戰事實，很可以鼓動僑胞更加踴躍地參加抗戰；當中英國友人代表萬國商團慰努我軍的一段，尤其適宜在港九宣揚，以利增進中英的邦交。</p>
<p>「中國軍人是不怕死的」！「還我河山是個個中國人的食任」，「………」很多警惕的壯語都激起了一陣熱烈的掌聲。升上燦爛輝煌的國旗的時候，全體站立致敬！敏感的會情不自禁地流着熱淚，</p>
<p>第三幕是「家散人亡」。劇情具有硬性的抗戰意識，趣味又不低級，是這次游藝最成功，最叫座的一慕。女孩子詹勵恆表演得够大眞，够活潑，在觀衆的印象中，更有高度的好感。</p>
<p>最末，是立正唱國歌，這個嶄新的游藝會在一時三十分的光景下幕了。</p>
<p>據方與巖先生語記者：這次來賓共有一千八百餘人，約可籌募港幣八百餘元。除戲院租六十元，及其他娛樂捐種種開消須花去二百餘元外，圖書館基金可實得純利五六百元，這是工作的開始，以後還得再加設法擴充。記者在深致敬意中，默祝這個圖書館早日成立起來，使大衆得到一些精神的食糧。</p>
<h3 id="c44">掀起澳門劇運狂潮　香港時代劇團在澳義演 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 朱白水</p>
<p>有若東方蒙地加勞的名美的澳門，完全充滿着命運底鬥爭的氣息，所有人們底意志，都沉溺在緊張，娛樂和鬥爭常中！</p>
<p>許多懷着探險家底心。抱着找尋刺激的情緒，拚命地迴旋在這不夜天的澳門底領城，他們希望從番攤，蔴省，　盤，舖票，歡淫當中去注賭自己的命運；然而，命運底安排却使無數人底生命走到失敗中，悲慘地永不翻身一</p>
<p>同樣地，澳門底文化也是悲慘　得不到解放，她可象永恆地麻木着戰抗底偉大而神聖的行動推不動她底爬行；澳門有着舊的封建色素，有着殖民地底同樣命運，他更有者我們底敵人的陰影在徘徊，因此，澳門底文化是頑固而殘酷地過活着。</p>
<p>劇運自然也不例外地受到不幸的命運，然雖澳門的劇運工作者拚命地工作，但未能把這種子好好生長着是事實，最近曾舉行四核聯演籌賑等，成續很好，惜以環境關係，最近又沉靜了，</p>
<p>冀待外來的力量刺激她，推動她，這種希望潛流在澳門的工作者底心裏，他們希望外來的團體蒞澳工作，</p>
<p>終於，以嶄新的姿　出現於香港的唯一的粵語職衆化的時代劇團底旗幟，於十二月九日開始飄展在澳門了！</p>
<p>時代劇團底蒞臨澳門，不單如名銜上說為香港　賑會回國服務團及澳門難民籌賑的，她更是重要地負上推動澳門劇運，推動澳門文化的使命呵！</p>
<p>這一次遠征澳門，時代劇團動員了廿七八位團員來工作，在這當中，包括了　台上的演員，後台裏的工作人員和木匠，任何一個人都以興奮和熱烈的情緒參加工作的，</p>
<p>十二月九日早晨，他們踏上港澳輪船，離開香港了。盧敦，李晨風，吳回，王鏗，張瑛，區愛，李月淸，高緯蘭等都做了行程的人物。</p>
<p>在十一時即已到達這新的地　來了，南園酒店做了他們的行營，安定行囊後，分頭去工作了。察視做舞臺的戲院，接洽澳門當地的戲劇界，購置應用的器具等。</p>
<p>每日港澳的尾輪載來了他們演戲的大批硬景和樂具，他們親自動員把她搬淮舞棗去，每個劇員都是那麽沉毅苦幹地工作着。那時已是夜深二時了。</p>
<p>翌晨是十日那天，本定下午是澳門文化界舉行歡迎會招待時代劇團的，但為了時間和工作都沒法子辦到。結果，祇有改期了！</p>
<p>當天早晨，全澳最負盛名的維多利大戲院底門首，懸上時代劇團義灑的輝煌廣吿了，街頭也貼得很多，吸引着所有的人。把全澳門的人們都吸引得注意着，興奮着，祈望着。</p>
<p>他們是忙碌得非常的在裝置看舞臺，每個人都在工作，一切燈光，裝體，都用自己的力和汁去努力地完成着，從每一點了作上都表現出他們是埋頭苦幹，他們是堅毅苦鬥，為了拓展劇運底領域。他們是貢献人所以的力量。</p>
<p>有晚演出的是曹禺的名作「雷雨」，這劇在澳門聽說已曾上演四五次，然而，在是晚未開演前，如潮波一樣的觀衆已湧着在戲院裏。是晚的演出，除了第三幕因澳門缺乏物質關係致效果未見佳外，其他的博得了無很的掌聲，</p>
<p>於十一日下午仍　演雷雨，演出此昨晚更好了。楚晚上演的是尤兢名著「夜光杯」，這劇的效果很妤，時代劇團演來極見超卓，緊張而感人，每一幕鄱博得如雷的掌聲，這是一個抗戰劇本，故激昂之處很多，但是晚據報觀衆中有×人的特務機關的人到塲，在日澳親善之卜（日本海軍司令鹽澤適到訪澳督呢）迫得臨時刪了許多對詞，但興當的掌聲仍舊雄偉地震盪在這戲院裏。震動在觀衆的內心裏，更震激在傻略者底野心裏！</p>
<p>跟着于十二日績演「夜光杯」，衣則演出「油漆未乾」。以上三天是為杳港學賑會囘國服務團及澳門難民而籌賑的，從十三日全十四日兩大，是該團自行籌欵的演出的劇目十三日為一油漆未乾」，夜為「升官發財」（魔窟）—四日為「夜光杯」，夜仍為「升官發財」。</p>
<p>澳門的劇運是沉寂而荒冷的，以前雖有大小劇團四五個，可是于最近完全停頓了，直釗最近始由張雪峯等組織二「未名劇社」，從事劇運。不可否認，在這貿弱的澳門劇　當中，時代劇團以嶄新姿態出現着，是刺激着這極貧弱的現象，給予澳門劇壇一個良好的影嚮，給予澳門人士們一個最優良的精神糧食</p>
<p>在祖國烽火遍燃中，抗戰方酣中，我們底戲劇不單是為藝術，她應是一種最好的宜傳，她應是一個最優秀的時代底號角！</p>
<p>祝時代劇團向這光榮之途邁進！</p>
<p>（一，一三夜于澳門）</p>

<p>離這裏不遠尙有太乙洞、因無正式的路徑可通、所以知這的入很少、洞在蓮花亭上面、須攀草　枝地爬行上去、洞口很小、纔可容人、入內曲折幽深、行一二十步就幽黑如漆、伸手莫辨五指、惜未帶僜燭、只好囘首出洞、在暮色蒼茫中、趕囘湧泉寺、</p>
<p>翌晨在暖和的陽光底下、跨出了湧泉寺的山門、在下山的途中、我們順道瀏覽鼓山的十八洞和十八景、其實、十八洞中有妤幾個洞是在鼓山的北首、前天已遊過了、至於十八景中、更有許多就在巖　的裏面、所以我們化不上一會工夫便把各處遍遊了、各巖中除山北的幾個而不計外、以蓮花亭為最大、達摩洞和呂仙岩都還精　、這些巖洞、多半都沒有洞的形式、有的簡直就是幾間房子、裏面住上一二個僧人、據說這些人都在湧泉寺裏面做過三年的苦工、沒有領過一文、『犒勞錢』【按即工銀】所以寺中方丈對於他們，亦另眼相看、通常對他們的生活、也不加以何等拘束、必須犯重大過失時、才可以依例起單【意即開除】、起單的方法、是由寺中把草鞋一雙、褂在僧房的門上、那麽對方僧人便自己明白了、至十八景中則以『二甲卸　』的那塊大巖石比較可視、石面印若片片魚鱗般的波紋、殊為逼眞、但不知道是否天然侵蝕而成的、</p>
<p>路過千福菴的時候、一個身矯健的年靑婦人、從老遠田地裏放下工作趕過來把我們迎到菴裏去、門兒推開來、裏面靜悄悄得沒有一點聲息、菴的當中、是長方形的天井、四周環建平房、光線還妃、但是因為屋宇和各種傢俱都沒有油漆過、一切顯得慘澹而凄厲、反映着這些被人們遺志的人度着的寂寞生活、該菴據說是閩北邵武縣某富戶捐資興建的、凡茹素婦女出安單費五六百元卽可寄托菴中、終身食宿、我們亦菴裏走馬看花地兜個圈兒就出來、</p>
<p>太陽依然温柔地照着、我們隨着山坡的傾斜、一步一步地踏着寬闊石級往下走、鼓山的勝景、也跟着一步一步而離開我們、不一會、脚底已踏上平坦的福馬公路、回頭看湧泉寺、已消失在滿山松林之中、只有高插入雲的絕頂峯、依舊巍然站在那　、似乎向我們做最後一刹那的話別、無情的長途汽把我們載囘到福州城裏、從此　山的勝跡、只有留在我們此憧和回憶之中去體味</p>

<p>【上海通訊】自戰事西移後、浦江水面交通、雖有臨時組織之若干外商輪渡公司、派輪載運交貨、但其中×商上海輪渡公司、藉其强有力之後盾、陸續淘汰各公司、截至近日為　、浦江長渡、北起高橋、南至周家渡、悉歸該公司所句辦、營業航綫、較前上海市興業信托社所辦者尤為展長、×「市府」雖有偽「公用局」之設置、但無權顧問、茲將詳情併紀如下、</p>
<p>商辦市辦　渡業沿草</p>
<p>浦江東西交通、前淸時代、僅有周家渡、南碼頭、董家渡、老白渡、楊家渡、爛泥波春江碼頭、墳山碼須等八長渡、均係短程對江渡、民國成立後、又擴展賈家角、西渡、高廟、東溝、高橋、吳淞等各對江渡、但係一律商辦性質、自民國十六平上海市政府成立後、始陸續開辦設備完善行駛安全之長短渡市輪渡、長渡有吳淞、高橋、東溝、高廟、西渡、五綫、均以北京路碼頭為起點、短渡有高廟、其昌棧、春江碼頭、東昌路、董家渡等五發，而民渡改善者，亦有楊家渡、南碼頭、周家渡、三對江綫、故四通八達、民衆出入、異常安全、</p>
<p>戰後新興者被淘汰</p>
<p>迨八一三滬戰後、×方第一步封鎖各渡口、並將市辦渡輪十艘（尙有兩艘、已被華方放沉浦底）、一併拖去、故當時浦江交通、除東昌路、畫家渲、南碼頭民渡得以復業外、僅有若干新與之外商輪渡公司、取得臨時營業執照、行使高橋、東溝、高廟、及南黃浦之董家渡、南碼頭、白蓮涇、與南市大碼頭各長渡綫，經營此業者、計有大來·馬勒·福利·惠通·江浙·上海等各家、其中上海一家、卽為日商日淸公司所辦、互相競爭頗烈、不久南市大碼頭一綫、先被×軍所阻、繼而董家渡·南碼頭·白蓮涇之南黃浦各綫、亦被勒令停駛，北黃浦之高橋、東溝·高廟·三綫則被上海公司藉×方後盾勢力、得以獨家航駛、其他各公司先後淘汰、被迫停業</p>
<p>上海獨家　操縱長渡</p>
<p>南黃浦長渡綫停航後，上南交通頗感不便、於是×軍南匯宣撫班自辦周家渡、南碼頭兩長渡綫、直通公共租界外灘九江路碼頭、派有第一第二南匯丸渡輪兩艘、往返對開、渡資單程三角、營業相當發達、上海輪渡公司垂涎此兩長渡綫已久、遂向×軍特務部活動多時、直至最近、獲得營業執照、准許該上海公司展航南碼頭、周家渡、而長渡綫、公共租界則改在北京路碼頭、（卽高橋、東溝、高廟三綫起點　上下、已於日前正式營業、南匯×青無班所辦之南　頭、周家渡、兩長渡終、則同時停航，於是南黃蒲北黃浦之長渡航綫、悉歸×商上海公司獨家操縱、</p>
<p>渡資高昂　月獲鉅利</p>
<p>上海公司獲得此項專利獨航營權後、考其所訂各線渡資、除南碼頭周家渡兩綫、前市辦輪渡並未開航、故無前例可援外、北黃浦之高橋等三綫、渡資異常高昂計高橋綫單程特等一元二角、頭等八角、、二等四角、東溝綫單程特等九角頭等六角、二等三角、高廟綫對程特等六角、頭等四角、二等二角、與前市輪渡相較、超過一倍有奇、而所用渡輸、均為被擄去之前市渡輪十總、鬆漆改樣、計南黃浦為東溝、西渡、東昌、定海、威賽等五艘、北黃浦為吳淞、高橋、江蘇、淞江、春江、等五轉、更替掉班、每日總開支為六百元、而每日售票所得、各綫總共有一千二百元左右、適為對本對利、故一月間可獲利兩萬元之譜、</p>
<p>乂方垂涎　幻　未成</p>
<p>自上海×「督署」改為×「市府」、將原有×交通局」改為×『公用局』後，×『市長』博筱庵、對此一筆龐大收入、垂涎欲　、曾向×方非正式要求收回、名為「市辦」、結果此項要求、未達目的、傳筱庵心猶不甘、最近又向×「維新」上司恭獻計劃、故由×「行政院長」梁鴻志、再向日方提出接收之意、×方以各航綫收益頗豐、仍予拒絕、致偽方迷夢、頓吿粉、</p>
<p>原有民渡　多悉被阻</p>
<p>至浦江原有民渡、×方藉口軍事關係、除東昌路董家南碼頭三對江綫外、其他各　、因渡口封鎖，不允開放、故周家渡、老白渡、楊家渡、春江碼頭　墳山碼頭、其昌棧、賈家角、西渡、高廟、東溝、高橋、各對江渡綫、迄今無法復業、而頓此生活之數千名渡船夫、失業年餘、生活亦在困苦中勉强維持、　慘情形、非外間所能知其萬一、</p>

<p>梧州通信、當廣州淪陷之頃、記者從難民叢中、渡河脫險、遵陸步行而西、經過順德、番禺、南海、三水、高明、高要、然後溯江西行入桂、沿途或因車頓留滯、或在各墟　　村暫住、探聽各方情况、故歷時二十餘日、始抵桂境、茲將沿途見閒情况、紀述如次、</p>
<p>廣州以—月二十一日、在第四路軍總司令余漢謀守土之下、不幸失陷、當晚廣州生命屬易簣之際、記者决心離市、丰黃沙渡河過芳村、及抵黃沙過海埗頭時、見市內民衆扶老擄幼、肩挑背負、　隊隊擠擁爭渡、喧囂聲和哭聲、嚷成一片、各商店又復爭搬貨物離市、或波石圍塘、或過芳村、或移河　、汽車貨車人力車、塞滿途路、步行者幾無轉身之地、正喧嚷擠擁中、忽來警報、全市電火盡熄、逃難民衆、更露驚惶狼狽狀態、其被濟墜水、或被迫氣絕而死之老弱男婦小孩、沿海碼頭、均有發現、記者以大洋五元、覓一小舢舨、由黃沙渡過芳村、登陸時、已深夜九點多鐘、遙望北岸之黃沙車站、黑影幢幢、俄　機關槍聲卜卜、在車站附近爆發、密如年炮、約廿分鐘之久始息、斯時有機車數輛、在站內升火候命、站前後大軍震集、軍用品物及重火器、堆積如山、蓋係集合候車、向粵路北撤、是夜、廣州秩序已陷紛亂狀態矣、</p>
<p>在河之南、有兩條為難民疏散必經之路、（當日已無船隻祇有陸行）一由石塘沿廣　鐵路而全三水、一由芳村經招村平洲而至陳村、故避難者、苟能渡河、則兩路均可行志、記者至芳村後、聞說石圍塘一路擁迫不堪、蓋一般避難民衆、僉謂石圍塘有火車輸送、萬一火車過於擁擠、卜可沿鐵路步行、因此之故、此路避難民衆特別多、火　徹夜開行、每兩點鐘一次、卒無法載運完竣、而沿鐵各步行者、多至不可以數計、記者以廣三路車輛、常被飛機轟襲、中途必易生窒礙及危險且難民衆多、雖有車輛、亦非我輩文弱者所能爭奪乘搭、於是改向別路西行、二十一日凌晨、徒步離去芳村、取道招村平洲直至陳村、不料此路難民、亦有數　、均以投到陳村為臨時目的地、由芳村至陳村（順德屬）約五十餘華里、沿路村落、均有自衛團放哨保護、及指導路徑、所過各橫水渡、可無格外需索、秩序尙稱良好、行至半途、聞廣州爆炸聲甚厲、中午十二時抵陳村、適遇日飛機三架飛來、向陳村新墟之碧江海口投彈數枚、將惠安缸瓦窑轟炸毀塌、又在林頭車站（通大良公路）投彈數枚、死傷五六人、據說、此為日飛機轟炸陳村第一次、於是該　民衆、大起恐慌、省陳之間、相距達四五十里、若用輪船行駛、不過兩卜時、卽可到達、省城旣陷、則陳村當然不能引以為安、當時該墟設有兩個難民收容所、因為人數衆多、無法客納、墟內空閒祠宇、及街頭巷尾、均有難民瑟縮其間、食餐露宿、狀極凄慘、入夜之後、遙聞廣州方面、終夕有大砲聲及炸彈聲、二十二早、廣州警察局之員警等、逃至陳村者約有百數十名、軍政機關職員、亦有百餘人避地來此、或轉往大良、據說、二十一日上午、廣州市內、已無軍警維持、全市秩序大亂、漢奸地痞、乘機竊發，縱火搶刦云云、直至二十二夜、火猶未息、在陣村北望，見滿天通紅、是　、該墟警察所、論令灣沿河面之船舶、一律駛往三水河口集中、免資×方利用、墟內人口、亦奉令疏散、全墟商業、陷入停頓狀熊、</p>
<p>廿三日凌晨、記者離陳村西行、預備到西樵之官山墟住宿、官陳兩地、相距約六十餘里、沿途經過順德屬之樂從、南海屬之吉利兩墟、然後可抵官山、中間過樂從、該墟旁之公路橋樑、（汀佛公路通道）已於先一日（二十二日）自動炸毀、據該墟某，長云、江佛公路鐵橋共十一座、均於廿二日奉令炸毀、該路車輛未及調用者、亦完全拆去車輪及重要機件、分散各鄉停放、故該路交通、完全停頓、惟樂從民衆、仍如常鎭定、商店營業照常、因避難人口增加、商業倍形鬧熱、多數人尙未知廣州淪陷也、茶　酒肆中、有談論廣州已失者、多不置信、僉以粵軍抗戰力量特强、防禦工事設備已年餘、×軍縱然猛攻、必能拼命抵抗、就使勢力不敵、亦必有一兩月支持、不至如是之易、而不料理想與事實、適得其反也、比至吉利、見該墟狀况、亦與樂從相同、及抵官山、已斜日銜山、天將向暮、各江小電輪及拖渡亭泊官山河面者、約廿餘艘、多數被機關封用、以待差遺、南海縣政府及縣黨部辦公人員、大部份暹至該墟、省城、佛山、陳村、瀾石、等處商民、亦多有逃難　此者、一時官山入口劇增、商業亦畸形暢旺，該墟雖隸屬南海、而偏於西隅、其地位又處於西樵山脚之下、交通殊非衝要、故抗戰年餘、日飛機未嘗至此騷擾、避難者，方以之為安樂士、不料二十四日竟有日機轟炸、損失不可計數、　（未完）</p>

<p>（西貢八日航空特訊）南華足球隊此次應西有足球總會的邀請、一行十九人征貢、我們在五日晨趁鯉門輪抵步時、海　是三日半、海程中遇有風浪、同隊中有六人量患帶浪　、沒有　食、這次出席西貢遠東網球賽的香港選手同輪、在輪中不會感到寂寞、鯉」的船長、他特別准許我們存甲板上練習跳繩和徒手運動、　在三天半的航途中、我們並沒有减少練習的時間、輪船是在九日晨泊岸的、西貢足球總會的會長、職員和華僑各界代表都齊集碼頭來歡迎、可見得華僑們怎樣的祟仰南華之鐵軍興期望我們在西貢能戰物當地的强旅、來替華僑們吐一口氣、　是外客到西貢時、上岸手績必須經過海關嚴密　檢查行李、當地官聽派員檢查　照、幸而我們的球隊得免去道一番麻煩手續、當輪船泊岸後、我們球隊是最先登岸的、球隊寄寓在一所華　的旅館　館名大華、它是一所偉大的建築物、恰與香港的半島酒店相似、每大除循例之應酬、茶會、餐會、練習外、每晚各球員在九時就睡覺、</p>
<p>到　後第一戰</p>
<p>第一戰在七日下午舉行、對方是法人選手隊、是西賣埠勁旗之　、今春西南征港隊之著名右翼圍殺安丁與人內輔都有出席、這塲比賽、戰來極度緊張、觀衆渴望看南華家表　，人數是相當擠擁的、南華應付第　場惡戰、當然是小心翼　、賽前、莫領隊向各隊員鼓勵、我們全體到場助威、結果、我們賴戰將努力、以七比四之成績先施下馬威、計陳　輝個人射入四球、黎兆榮兩球、羅斗文一、這　比賽、在上半時法聯隊以三比二一度佔優勢、全隊進攻時常　速、　時竟使南華之中後衛不易阻截、閱殺安丁是　軍表演最佳之一員、可是在下半時法聯隊當小起　　　之衝剌、始簽城下之、在南華隊方面、中後衛綫表演最佳、劉慶才頭　是路、前傳線以德輝與兆榮最出色、水益表演、未能滿人意、最令我們駕異的就是西貢的足球、球員隨時可以更換、更換時可以隨時進場、並不須要向球証說知的、</p>
<p>上半時三比一</p>
<p>開　僅八分鐘、神腿低傳，黎北榮先建第一功·未五分鐘、法聯隊前鋒衝射、將球射到門之右方方，非張榮才可能挽救的、此時雙方打成一比一、約二十分鐘、聯取攻勢、　殺安丁切入、中　及時趕到、將球挑過榮，的頭、造成二比一、當時榮才棄　出迎、而作背城借一之舉、但未見收效、此時、法聯反佔優勢、越籍迷、莫名歡天喜地、喊吶助　、意以為可以操勝券、熟料南華諸將、表演異常賣力、中後衛有精彩演出、陳德輝如虎出洞、突破敵圍、成二比二、</p>
<p>德輝英勇善戰</p>
<p>未　德軍鐵腿力揮、反以三比二先、圍殺安丁　竟是利害、用頭頂入一球、上半時、三比三勝負不决、下半時、是南華之天下、在聯絡上、有純熱之合作、約十分鐘、德輝又有駕人表演、打進一球、南華又以四比三領先、黎兆榮造成五比三、羅斗文等到一個極好的機會、不待球落、用左腿打　入網、成六比三、最後、法聯之圍殺安丁在亂軍中打進一只、德輝完成　比四之數、南華陣勢如下、（朱兆但記）</p>

<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>愛美之心·人皆有之，但各人審美觀念不同，一般人所認為健美的體格，不一定含有「健　的成份。但　康的體格必含有「健美」的「美」。我們要有　正的「健美」，祇須針對着「健」向着它邁進。</p>
<p>眞正的健美唯有求於體育的方法。體育的範圍甚廣，但其中最重要的就是運動。各種運動中效率　大的英如徒乎體操和器械運動。</p>
<p>我鬥如欲在短明之內獲得眞正的「健美」須切實注意下列各點：——</p>
<p>（一）要有充分的休息，睡眠和營養。</p>
<p>（二）每日至少運動十五分鐘。</p>
<p>（三）每星期至少入浴兩次·如能每日入浴一次，則更佳。</p>
<p>（四）多飲淸水，保持大臟的潔凈。</p>
<p>（五）多行深呼吸，散步和日光浴。</p>
<p>（六）隨時皆須保持正確的身體姿勢。</p>
<p>（七）精神衛生——勿憂鬱，戒暴怒，務樂觀，精神奮發，思想正大。</p>
<p>從事健美運須先注重軀幹的鍛鍊，尤其是女子更須多行這極運動。但我門不可因此而忽視身體平均的發達。這裏所介紹的各種運動，一方面能鍛鍊軀幹，一方面也有便身體平均發達的功效。但對於己有堅强的基礎或軀幹會受相當鍛練的人，則比較適宜，功效也較大。</p>
<p>至於運動的　序現任我們暫時採用最簡單的力法，不分鍛練的部份。這裏每次所介紹的運動約有五種。我們祇要把每次所介紹的運動繼續練習約三日。然後再改行下次所介紹的運動，這樣過了兩三個月後，最好改為每日習不同的運動，及至所有的運動都做遍時，再回到舊的運動，在這個時候我們就要開始注意身體　比較落後的部份，並須攷訂較複雜的運動程子，設法使身體比較落後的部份赶　那些比較進步的部分。</p>
<p>這次所介紹的運動側重於背、要、臀、腿五部、並能增進身體的柔軟性、對於內部的鍛煉也很效、</p>
<p>（一）身體直立、兩臂向頭頂直伸兩脚相靠、滕部不可彎屈、然後下身儘量向前灣下、至手指與足尖相觸為止、上身同前彎下時呼、直立時吸、甘做二十或一十五次、</p>
<p>這个還動的功效除發達背部、後腰和腹　的肌肉外、尙能舒展背部肌肉和大腿後部的筋腱、使身體柔軟（未完</p>

<p>娛樂……社會暴徒</p>
<p>The　Last　Gansster</p>
<p>愛德華魯濱孫，扮演一個為非作歹的暴徒、在他過往作品中的成功、訨明他是一個傑出的人才、他那出神入化的演技、刻畫人微的性格表演、博得了每一個觀衆異口同　的攒許、</p>
<p>在本片中、他再飾一個無惡不作的暴徒、殺人越貨頑視國法、史　縱着整個社會的惡勢力、叱咤風雲、騙橫放縱、不可一世、而終為着　妻　子的緣故，犧牲一切、以及自己的件命、得到一個極　慘的下場、</p>
<p>愛德華在本片中的演技、處處迸着人才的火花、有着一種非常的動人力量、台演的有詹姆史蒂華　絲史屆南、同時在本片中、我們還看到好萊塢一張最完美的賊匪演員表、這一部「社會暴徒心中所有的緊張動人的情節將給　觀衆大量而强烈的新刺激、</p>
<p>皇后平安……漁船戰血</p>
<p>Spawn　of　tne　North</p>
<p>一部由文學名著改編的電彩、描寫美國北部邊境、北冰洋上阿拉士加半島、島上　民的生活觀那裏是大量「三文　」的出產地、但以捕魚謀生的漁民們、却須以絕大的努力去戰勝一切天然為人　的困難、像飄浮海面的冰山、漁賊的猖狂寺來維持他們的利益·在他們充滿着悠歌憎愛的生活中、有着不少動人心腸的故事了</p>
<p>本片就是叙述兩個好友、因為漁利的衝突、一個與漁賊合作、一個站在漁民自衛團方面、好友變成了仇家、同時在他們背後有着深愛他們的女子、朿手此策的、眼看他們互相鬥　、及後那跟海賊台作的、終於受傷而悔悟、故意把賊船撞沉在冰山之下、與漁賊同歸於盡、犧牲自己、玉成愛友、作為本片的高潮點、</p>
<p>本片的攝影技術、活潑巧妙、還有幾固印第安人祭儀典禮的鏡頭、在我們來看、是充滿　神秘的意味的、同時本片擁有五個星、主演的有　洽賴甫脫、亨利方　、和桃露珊拉摩、幷由愛金譚密各夫，約翰巴里穆亞等合　、情節的編排，使每人都有儘量發揮藝術天才的機會、導演亨利夏桑活、嘗導演過「松嶺恩仇記」和「抗敵英魂」等片、對於本片的情節及高潮點的　理、很有縱觀衆情緒的力量、</p>
<p>東方……古怪學士</p>
<p>Professor　Beware</p>
<p>羅亞自演「不怕死」後因辱華　係、給我們很不好的影　，　一時沒有片子到中　來、道次的「占怪學士」、在演出上還量同以前一樣的風格、情節是想入非非、也就以幾塲驚險的地方、他種呆頭呆腦的行動、使人　笑而已、自然這裏也有不少幽默場面和對白、</p>
<p>大華……泰山復仇</p>
<p>Tarzan＇s　Rvenge</p>
<p>故事半庸、述一位探險家欲捕白　深入豐夷、　王串通士人、欲擄「白種女人」，幸泰山力　，後白女竟因熱戀泰山、不復返去、</p>
<p>演出絕無驚人之處、遠不及　之「泰山情侶一主角格蘭馬立斯及依蓮諾霍姆、</p>
<p>景星……六女伶</p>
<p>Wklkfng　Down　Broadway</p>
<p>描寫六個似親姊妹般的女伶，一旦分離、因相處很久、均感依依不拾、最後約定在明年除夕會晤之期、但分散後、因各個人之命運不同、產生了不同的遭遇、悲歡離合、處理得很完餐、</p>
<p>中央……情天血淚　國語片</p>
<p>是以緒琛的原著收編，由卜萬蒼導演，可以說是駡輕就　、　主角仍由金燄担任，祗女主角及其餘的配角是　外由哀美雲及梅熹等替　了、</p>
<p>故事簡單一句佔說來、就是描寫一個在封建社會裏屢圖掙比而取後終以自我犧牲為了結一生的女性、</p>
<p>在演出下、可以說中洲意的作品了、就是那　『可　的母親』歌劇，因為太長而破壞了全劇的情緒、會燄，袁美襲，海熹了出都不差</p>
<p>新世界……春情烈火</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>比片叙述一大飯店內之黑幕、千奇百怪的社會動態露社會的畸形發展、看了有莫大之感觸、此片為正義公　之第一次出品、由　星斷山笑及陳雲裳主演、</p>

<p>— 凌松</p>
<p>寒夜在　國靠着洋風的調節，本來算不上什麽寒，但總比平常冷。</p>
<p>夜深了，越夜越有點冷。在燈下撈着筆的我似乎有點不支。</p>
<p>「沒用的東西」，我自己責備了「這麽的天氣，還支不住嗎？」</p>
<p>放下筆。袖着手在房子裏面走來走去。我聯想到寒夜裏的前方將士。在一聲冰硬鬚，征馬踟躊」的情况下，戰士們除了與惡魔奮鬥以外還要與大自然搏鬥。從給養以至服裝從起居生活以至工作時間，他們是無時無刻不在受苦，不分害夜在硬幹啊。在這冷森森的寒夜，也許有戰十們的欣然勝利，也許會在白雪上流下鮮紅的熱血，紅白交呢。為　國家的自由·民族的解放。他們在寒夜裏是艱苦地支撐着。</p>
<p>一沒用的東西一我心裏頭又自我責備起來了。遙念前方戰士的艱苦，實在不敢偷懶，筆，繼續在微弱的燈火下沙沙地響着。</p>
<p>寒風送來了一陣伊啞的胡零聲。斷斷續續夾着些地少女的歌要。不，是嗚咽　。我想像到寒風是無情地向她龔擊。她的單薄底衣裳捱不件風伯的殘暴，身體有點兒抖顫了。連帶她的歌聲也顫動起來。</p>
<p>「×人的鐵蹄遍了家鄉，生活的鞭子却有把她趕上了街頭，可憐的這寒夜的街頭啊！」必裏頭迷惘地思索着。</p>
<p>腦海中湧滿了露宿輢樓下的同胞，在曠野中失去了爹娘的孩十，那天涯海角的畸零人·那得不到家鄉淪陷後的消息底思鄉客，還有那些因營養　足而焦黃的面孔，瘦削的肢體·給生活的祖子壓灣了的脊骨與及在寒風中顫　着的啜音……</p>
<p>這是誰給我們的痛苦呢？</p>
<p>推開窗子望到馬路下移動着兩個瘦長的影子。蹣跚地在件奏着那斷斷續續的歌聲，伊伊啞啞的胡琴底音節。</p>
<p>左鄰懇來一陣一陣的爵十樂。那急促的跳盪的令人心　的旋律可以想像釗某一部分人底心情和生活面。在島上這個人並不是　有少數的，給　士樂遮蓋了曾經身歷過的大砲聲，炸彈聲，不復記憶，女人的胭脂底笑臉，紅　掩去了沾染在祖國大地上鮮紅的然血，綠玉般的酒杯，盛滿了紅色的葡萄酒。强烈的燈光　醉人的香呀交流着。把這島上四圍的火藥部持散了。</p>
<p>飲呀飲，忘記了家鄉，忘記了祖國。他們像不是黃帝的兒孫。</p>
<p>寒多裏也脫不去「一方面，嚴肅的工作，一方面，荒淫與無恥。」戰壕裏有茹苦含辛拚命殺敵的民埃解放戰士；這繁榮的語上也有盡情享樂，自私自利的人們。更有一批批忍受大時代的痛苦的同胞在寒夜的街頭流浪哪。</p>

<p>— 余一平</p>
<p>這個年頭，找飯吃眞難，不讀書旣不成，讀了書也不救國而設的××難民工業社，招考女社員五十位，報名的竟有一百五十多人；考試分口試，筆訊，和技術試三種；筆訊的題目是一抗戰勝利與難民生產之關係」。據說道次應試的有不少曾受高等教育，和領有大學畢業　憑，但該社各委員以其「技術當不限於此小工藝」，故沒有取錄。甘報說得好；「不會寫文章莫來作難民，會寫文章了，不許作難民。」</p>
<p>那些委員們愛惜人才的苦心實在値得嘉賞。大學畢業生能够作的事情多着，為甚麼要叫她們去作小工藝而限制了前途呢？大才小用，未免太把我們的大學敎育看成無甩，當然不成。但　麼一來，倒更護明我們的大學敎育無用。因為那幾位大學畢生想是拏着文　四處碰壁才跑來××工業社，但現在連幹小工藝的資格也沒有了，誰又料得到呢？</p>
<p>愛惜人人並非是不叫他作小事，而是提拔他去作大事。眞止的愛惜人才，得要好好的敎育人才，吏之不特學月所長，而目有用，作可以用。</p>
<h3 id="c67">寒 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 烈軻</p>
<p>季節雖輪到了冬天，但寒的感覺，依然是那麽地微薄，在南國，寒，似乎被閉在門外；那凛冽的北風，那堅硬的冰塊，那肥大如白胡蝶的雪花，……那寒夜的助威者，那寒的結晶品，不消說，在裏絕了跡；運一層極　極　的霜，也沒有降臨的可能—寒與南國，可說是絕緣了！</p>
<p>近來·我沒有被寒戚脅過，我也沒亻穿上寒大應穿的衣服，而且，連一點寒意都沒有過；這，幾乎會使我不相信是冬天—我看一看案頭新置的日曆，看一看壁上的寒暑表，以往的經　吿訴我；「時令與氣候太不調和了！」</p>
<p>自小生長在北國的人，對於寒，並不如南方人所想像的那般可怕—對于寒，確有一種特具的耐力；運對于寒天的景物，也有一種獨特的賞識和偏愛；那被積雪漫蓋着的皓白色人地，那銀一樣白的雪及射過來刺人的光綫，那澈底凍結着冰層的溝渠，那光充着樹枝的叢林，那尋覓寒食的老鴉發出一種寒愴的嗚叫，那……一景一物·永遠被北國的人們所夢繞着！……</p>
<p>現在，我不幸任南國，我每天所能見到的，是一片茫茫的海·和呆　如笨牛的維多利亞山；色調永遠是那麽地單純，樹木也是那麽地靑蒼，呆滯，寂寞，看不見有半點的變動，分不出有什麼夏景和冬景……我知道，這便是缺乏寒的關係，因此，我更領略寒的偉大，寒的改造力和變化力的驚人！我不實成「寒是殘酷的，它會使草木凋零」的說法；相反，我却以為『草木凋零』，能算它的酷殘，而正是它的偉大處你想，不這樣，樹木怎會鍛鍊出堅固結實的枝幹來？怕會和熱帶裏長成同樣地　懈吧？不這樣，怎會有春天的嫩芽和柳綠，怎會有夏天的一片的蒼翠？又怎會有秋天的黃葉和紅楓？……</p>
<p>在寒的境界裏長成的　木，株株是分外的堅硬；在寒的境界裏長成的草卉，根根是特別的勁强；在寒的境界裏長成的人，也個個是出衆的勇悍！寒，畢竟是萬物的試金石，它會消除　弱的敗類，它會向不屈服的孤松歌唱！寒天也就是萬物之夜，它會指使木樹虫類好好地去睡眠，好好地去休養！預備明年的春大，怎樣地去發展滋長！</p>
<p>寒，並不可怕！它沒有夏熱的浮浪，春和的放湯，秋凉的蕭條，它唯一的特徵，便是嚴肅；愛嚴肅的人們應當歡迎它！</p>

<p>隊伍由平漢路鄂北段一帶開向鄂來，原定是東路的繼預備隊，臨時的日務，是準備防守巴河綫，為了要在巴河岸上求得實際的　守經驗起見，還籌備了一個河川防禦演習，什麽全準備好了，只差那演習的日子沒有定好，血在時接了開拔豫序的命令。是九月一日那一天，命令從乒團部一直下到了師部，演習的事情臨時收塲大吉，因為隊伍在一日就要開始行軍。</p>
<p>在一個地方住得太久，那是極易引起人們厭倦之感的，尤其是兵士們，他們彷彿人人長了一副好動身子；一天走上多少路，活動活動，他們不懼怕，叫他們久住在一個地方不動，那比他們坐牢還難忍受。又加上隊伍自從開到巴河綫來之後，由於　士不服，由於蚊子的猖狂，兵士們十個倒有七個以上全生了病，這希望開拔的心思，早在兵士們間蜸立起來，他們甚而還拉出河南腔，悲愪地怨艾地駡道；</p>

<p>兩個大夥子，國個小夥子，我們合共起來是四個。</p>
<p>我和英，小的兩個，走在前面；紈相平，大的兩個跟在後頭。　黑夜的空虛使我們感受到極端的冷漠，躺在夜空下的平野都像剛剛死去不久似的，修長的竹林子死直地企立着，池塘的水面冉沒有波訅的縐紋了，躺着平直得好像一個悒鬱的中年寡婦的面孔一樣，只有野草被霧水洗淋過一次淸冷的沐浴，顯得格外有生趣的向道幾個人閃耀管那黏附在它身上的魚鱗一般的露珠，可是，它究竟給我們一脚一脚地踐踏下去，使得它的身子仍然回復到以前一樣的骯髒了。</p>
<p>偶然發生一點輕微的音響，卽使是不足引人法意的。，在却例外地吸住我們的注意，因為周圍都是潜、着死物，運動着的只有我們的影子。</p>
<p>胆怯而怕黑的人，是同樣地是害怕趕夜路的，他們歇斯的里地忖度着：『蛇會爬行着他那彎曲的身子出來嚙人脚踝的。』多了這一個原因，更大的恐怖亦就滋長起來了。</p>
<p>「我們手上沒有態熊的火把，假若大轟出林了。怎麽能恫嚇得住它？」</p>
<p>想到了這，我們更加惶恐了。手醒一下鼻，打量着這一夜所要走完的路，胆子就壯大些來了。</p>
<p>於是，還對自己說下一句奮勉的說話：</p>
<p>『要趕的路還多着呢！』</p>
<p>快捷地，我們離開了四面都是竹林環繞有的黑夜的村莊，立刻又投奔到別個村莊裏去。</p>
<p>禾田早就收割好了，牧成之後漸漸凝結成固實了的泥土，也被黃牛拖着的犂耙鍫鬆了，田與田之間剷下一條狹隘得再沒有這樣狹隘的田徑，作為行人的過道。</p>
<p>我們　在徑上，就像踏在單條的　綫上似的，差點兒滾下出間去。</p>
<p>生長在夜底魔手下的繁茂野林，條然迷了我們底路向，偏偏村人又好像故意躱避了黑夜似的，天色一黑就全都躲藏在自己家裏，但迷途的我們却在他們的門外敵他出來。</p>
<p>高年的老婆子應着聲出到鬥口外，她用了很人的氣力來重複着　所熱知的路徑</p>
<p>『繞個這過竹林子，就可以直梅花古寺去。』她那張過分寬長的袖子贅着她的手肘，繞了一個圈子，然後急激地向前指着一個方向</p>
<p>辭謝了她，我們踏去了不少個竹林的小道，趨近了一個生疏的村子。</p>
<p>守　着這村頭的自衛團員喝着通過的口令：「口令！」</p>
<p>「戰三隊！」</p>
<p>「那里去？」</p>
<p>「目標！蓮花寺！」</p>
<p>等到我們逼近他的時候，他就趨前幾步來查察我們</p>
<p>通過了他原來站着的崗位，一班靑農在一家門口聚談着一些有趣的事情。一時問發覺我們，其中一位忠厚長者就出來盤問我們的來去</p>
<p>在我們，幷不祖心到他們中的任何一個會阻止我們的行進，反而因為這村一槍查相守衛的愼密而沾沾自喜着。</p>
<p>「我們中國人，做起了以前所從未做過的事。」</p>
<p>其實，値得我們在歡喜之後，還要感激不盡的事止多看，憑靠了長者好心的引帶，使我們雖在茫茫的黑夜之中不致有第二次的迷路。</p>
<p>『打從那里可以穿出大路，直撲蓮花寺呢？』</p>
<p>「可以呀，我帶你出去。」</p>
<p>於是，這忠誠的長者就做起我們帶路的頭兒來了，沿途，他渡山涉水，矯健得像一只海鷹。</p>
<p>他是開通的，他說了許多便我們不必再向他解說的話，反而，還有一點要給我們久久地記取着，那就是用來對靑年人的一塊純撲而體貼的心地。</p>
<p>他駐足下來的時候，指一指遠方說。「離開你們要到的地方不遠了。」</p>
<p>我們再抖撇一下勇邁的精神，直撲向那一座古老面龐大的寺堂去。</p>
<h3 id="c70">柏林的婦女時裝 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 澄清</p>
<p>你們不要忘記了希特拉是一個美術家，他是一個很過得去的油漆匠，他曾經親自去設計自己的寢室，今春又落成了一座「新阿房宮」了，不但如此，他還舌心孤詣地巷德國婦女製備了一九三九年的新裝哩，這　裝據說是很「光榮」的，這「光榮」是和勒住肚皮去製大炮一樣出色。</p>
<p>在柏林的大街上，也許是乳酪店門前，你就可以看見一羣舞動着大屁股，震顚着胖胸膛的幼女，在這「偉大的行列里」個個胸前都懸　着銅的，銀的，金的十字章，這就是一九三九年德國婦女的新敎，是美術家希特拉鈎心斗角想出來的。</p>
<p>新裝的中腰很胖，是生孩子多的大臀部女人穿的。因為她們的領袖要她生許多孩子，六個，七個，八個，九個……越多越好，越多起『光榮』，不過·這「光榮」可惜連婦女本身也不大了解，家里有一个失業的丈夫，還有幾个挨餓的孩子，幹嗎還要生許多孩子？為什麽大量生孩子就是一件「光榮」的事？孩子們要是多起來了，那末麵包店和乳酪店門，排起來的「尾巴」就會更長，等買東西的時候也更要久了，德國的牛油和食料不是早已拿了去喂大炮了嗎？因為缺乏牛油連大塊願戈林將軍　瘦了許多飭，那許多許多孩子們將吃什麽呢？德國的經濟，枯蜴的，，目前　不能充份供給人民的糧食，却要大量增加人口，這結果只有更積極向外侵略，發動大規模的戰爭，戰爭是德國的出路，也是德國孩子們的出路——去死——今天「努力」生產的天眞孩子就是未沐一箱箱的炮灰。希特拉恨不得婦女們的生肖像細胞分裂一樣的快，一樣的多更希望孩子們像橡皮人一樣的可以很快地吹大起來，「製造」孩子像製造軍械一樣的成績，好完成「我底奮鬭」的「美夢」。</p>
<p>孩子何辜？沒有出世就被注定了死無完屍的命運，希特拉是兒童的罪人，也是婦女們的大罪人，他把婦女們看做一个可以勞動，可以生育的「動物」，而且準備去屠殺她們氏丈夫和兒子（將來底戰爭）那獎勵生育的十字章不是一光榮」的符號，相反地是罪惡的恥辱的符號，為了自由，為了和平，我們要撕毀這罪惡的恥辱的「新裝」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Expectations for the Fifth Plenary Session <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, abbreviated as the Fifth Plenary Session, according to news from the occupied territories, has been confirmed to open on the 20th of this month in Chongqing, only five days from now. According to the General Regulations of the Nationalist Party, the Central Committee Plenary Session is the most important body within the Party, second only to the National Congress. It is convened every six months, and its location must be the same as that of the central government. Its importance in nature and authority does not need to be elaborated. Moreover, the affairs of the state and the governance of the party are not limited to the internal affairs of a single party. For nearly twenty years, the major plans of the Party and the state have originated here. Especially in extraordinary times, with the War of Resistance and national reconstruction involving countless matters, looking ahead and behind, carrying on the past and opening up the future, matters await exploration or vigorous implementation, each concerning the future of the Party and the nation. Therefore, this Fifth Plenary Session is certainly not comparable to the routine meetings held every six months in the past. The agenda and proceedings of the Fifth Plenary Session are inaccessible to outsiders. Even the most important topics to be decided are not like those of previous plenary sessions, where the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee could be glimpsed in advance. Since the main issues have not been disclosed to this day, reporters have no way to comment on specific matters. However, there are some situations that we deeply feel uneasy about on a regular basis, and we would like to present them briefly. The foolish thoughts of a thousand men may contain one valuable insight!</p>
<p>Since the Nationalist Party adopted the system of a Director-General based on the decision of last year's Provisional National Congress, there has been unanimous praise from both inside and outside the Party. It is believed that power will be concentrated from now on, and will unified, and that the strength of the organization will presage rapid progress in accomplishments. However, as time passes, there is not much visible progress. This is because during wartime, military affairs are the priority, and the Party does not have the time to devote its full strength to Party affairs. Even if some efforts are made, although the achievements are significant, they are overshadowed by the war and not fully known to everyone. This is due to both subjective and objective factors, and naturally the achievements cannot meet expectations. In the future, as the overall situation enters a critical stage, we should still recognize the priorities and not demand perfection. However, the Central Committee members should not be too lenient with themselves. The status of the original Central Committee members within the Party is not diminished by the system of a Director-General. Their service in Party and government affairs or in society is not reduced to that of subordinates because military affairs are the priority during wartime. Moreover, in terms of appropriate self-respect and a sense of responsibility to the world, they should possess the spirit of a Director-General and be a hundred or a thousand times more self-conscious in their diligence and self-improvement than ordinary Party members and the people, towards the Party, the country, the society, and even the duties they hold. It is hoped that besides the Director-General being sincerely admired by the whole country and regarded as the sole leader, the Central Committee members will also demonstrate their extraordinary qualities to ordinary Party members and the people in various spiritual aspects. It must be understood that the ability of any organization to maintain immortality lies in the formation of excellent traditions by the core members, and it cannot forever rely on any single individual. The Nationalist Party has a Director-General, but the Central Committee members, who are the core members, still have much to strive for. It is believed that the political future of the Nationalist Party depends entirely on how the Central Committee members create and complete an unshakeable foundation for the Party. If the core members are inferior to others, then the future will be inferior to others. The worry lies in oneself, not in others. The people have particularly high expectations for the Nationalist Party, and the Nationalist Party should urgently have practical achievements that meet the people's high expectations. This is the first point. The Nationalist Party has always established the Party and the nation with a revolutionary spirit, but in the last decade, the revolutionary spirit has gradually waned. Leaving aside matters concerning national policy, in terms of the Party, such as planning the Party's internal organization, promoting and implementing the Party's doctrines and policies, sanctioning all Party discipline within the Party, and selecting candidates for central and local officials at all levels, the revolutionary spirit is often found to be not thorough. Often, it starts with great fanfare and overwhelming force, but ends up being buried in ambiguity. In terms of sentiments and considerations, there must be unavoidable difficulties that are understood by the Party. However, the perceptions and influences, as well as the inadequacy of the effects and functions, may not be fully understood by the people. In the final analysis, the problems are not uniform, and there is no need to list them all. However, maintaining an open and impartial attitude, removing unnecessary entanglements and constraints, and developing and enhancing the original revolutionary spirit are the fundamental ways to cure the problems. This is the second point. This war of resistance has, in various aspects, internally and externally, for the nation, demonstrated the significance of innovation and reform. Even social undertakings and the establishment of careers for any individual will undergo severe tests and generate strong changes due to the war of resistance. This is an inevitable trend that is difficult to avoid. It is expected that the outstanding will obtain reasonable development, while the corrupt will be eliminated. If more human intervention is added, the final outcome may not fundamentally violate the trend, but the transitional phenomena created will vary greatly depending on whether the intervention is appropriate. In response to this great dynamic, those who plan for the country should have a clear understanding and guide it accordingly. In other words, efforts should be made to ensure that all reforms, successes, failures, rises, falls, benefits, and detriments are extremely fair, extremely economical, and extremely clear. Proper effort can shorten the process of completing the great task of national reconstruction; otherwise, it will only increase obstacles. The impact of this is far-reaching and indescribable, but starting from the basics, everything begins now. Therefore, planning for the Party and the nation now must at least involve reviewing and eliminating the unfair, uneconomical, and unclear aspects of implementation, both in terms of people and matters, and striving for ruthless elimination. Only with ruthless elimination can reasonable methods be obtained. This is the third point. Will the Fifth Plenary Session pay attention to these three points?</p>
<h3 id="e2">General Situation of the War of Resistance in North China and Estimation of Future Situation (II) <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Dehuai's speech at Mingfengji</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday's page six)</p>
<p>If we do not pay attention to and strive to mobilize and organize these female compatriots who make up half of our nation, the loss of this great force will be a regrettable matter. Moreover, failing to attract this great force to the anti-Japanese front will not only be a loss for our national liberation against Japan, but will also add many unnecessary difficulties to the war of resistance. Mobilizing military service is a very obvious example. If women can be organized, publicized, and educated so that they understand that if the War of Resistance against Japan is not victorious, they will be permanently oppressed and ××, it is necessary to remind them to encourage their husbands and sons to enlist and participate in various anti-Japanese work, and to help the army and the government in the war of resistance. This principle is very simple and obvious, but today there are indeed still people who hold inaccurate views, despise women, and regard women as "goods." In fact, it must be known that if half of the population is not liberated, even if the War of Resistance is victorious, the liberation of the Chinese nation cannot be considered truly complete.</p>
<p>(II) The center of women's work:</p>
<p>Is still to take resistance against Japan as the first priority. Only with national liberation can women's personal demands and liberation be fought for. Only by grasping the center of resistance against Japan can the actual interests of women themselves be obtained. However, this does not mean ignoring women's personal urgent demands, but rather that the liberation of women and national liberation are on the same path.</p>
<p>(III) Women's active performance in the war of resistance:</p>
<p>Women in the War of Resistance in North China have heroic and magnificent deeds, giving a serious blow to those who advocate that women "go to the family" and "return to the kitchen."</p>
<p>In the special environment of North China, wounded soldiers cannot be concentrated and are mostly scattered in farmers' homes. Women's love for the wounded soldiers is truly meticulous. They take the eggs they have saved up by exchanging oil and salt and send them to the wounded soldiers to eat, while they themselves are willing not to eat oil or salt. Everyone should not think that an egg is not a big deal, but a peasant woman regards eggs as very precious. The fact that they are willing to take out their eggs and give them to the wounded soldiers is so touching. Secondly, they encourage their husbands and sons to go to the anti-Japanese motorcade to become soldiers, make shoes, socks, and gloves to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers, spin yarn, weave cloth, sew military uniforms, supply the army, and participate in agricultural production, plowing fields and harvesting wheat, all of which they strive to do. The large increase in food production in North China last year owes much to the efforts of women. In particular, mobilizing military service and strengthening the replenishment of troops is truly a major event. The merits of women that are worthy of commendation.</p>
<p>(IV) Experience of women's work:</p>
<p>(a) Taking resistance against Japan as the center, everything is for resistance against Japan, and everything is subordinate to resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>(b) First absorb enlightened women from families with good conduct and intellectuals, train them, and educate them, but attention must be paid to the special habits of the Chinese nation's history to avoid hindering the work.</p>
<p>(c) After training, returning home to the countryside does not mean provoking the consciousness of women's resistance, but rather playing an active exemplary role in all aspects, influencing men and children to make them progress, and arousing the admiration of neighbors, villagers, family members, and raising the status of women. Therefore, in many places in North China today, Xuanzi have been elected as village chiefs and district chiefs to participate in political activities.</p>
<p>(d) Cultivating women's ability to work and improving women's knowledge, not being arrogant, having a peaceful attitude, not only doing the hard work of women, but also doing the work of backward men. Only in this way can the bad habit of belittling women be broken.</p>
<p>(E) Anti-Japanese work for children:</p>
<p>(1) Children's national salvation organizations are quite common in North China, in the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, west of Pinghan, and south of Zhengtai.</p>
<p>(2) Educating children, raising national consciousness, doing anti-Japanese work, raising cultural level, mobilizing literate children to help illiterate people, participating in singing and speech activities, and promoting the war of resistance.</p>
<p>(3) The work undertaken by children, in addition to propaganda and education, includes checking road passes, questioning pedestrians, detecting suspicious persons, comforting families of anti-Japanese soldiers, and cracking the conspiracies of traitors and Japanese to poison people. (In front of the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army, a child caught a traitor who was poisoning a well.)</p>
<p>(4) The children themselves have education and training, hold meetings to discuss, and self-criticize, so that they can be tempered into children of a new country of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>(F) Work for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers:.</p>
<p>Work for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers is very important, and in North China, special attention is also paid to this work.</p>
<p>(1) Organize "Anti-Japanese Soldiers' Families Committees," with one village or several neighboring villages as a unit, elect committee members, stipulate meeting times, once a week, so that they can communicate and discuss issues, solve the difficulties and needs of the families, conduct education and propaganda, and mobilize families to write letters to comfort the soldiers at the front and strive to fight.</p>
<p>(2) Raise the social and political status of the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, invite them to be chairmen at meetings and praise them among the masses, mobilize social groups to comfort and help them, give them encouragement in spirit, and provide concrete help in material terms, such as helping with farming, harvesting, lending money, county magistrates or other administrative officials, presenting "Glory" plaques, and personally visiting them to offer comfort.</p>
<p>(3) The families of anti-Japanese soldiers enjoy various "priorities," free tuition for their children, discounted purchases at cooperatives, and necessary economic support.</p>
<p>All of these are for the victory of the war and accurately and practically strike at the past notion that "good sons don't become soldiers, and good iron doesn't become nails."</p>
<p>(4) Conduct education for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, so that they are not arrogant and play an exemplary role among the masses, gaining more care and help from the masses. At the same time, this education is not empty preaching, but rather organizing them, holding meetings for discussion and criticism, and having the masses educate the masses.</p>
<p>Only in this way can the cooperation between the military and the people be further strengthened, so that the people believe that the army is our army, and the army becomes the armed force of the people. Otherwise, empty slogans are ineffective.</p>
<p>(G) Propaganda and education work for the masses:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of propaganda and education is, at a minimum, to raise the spirit of resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>(2) The teaching materials for propaganda and education can be the Three People's Principles, the Program for Resistance against Japan and National Reconstruction, President Chiang's important speeches, the concrete lessons of the eighteen months of resistance against Japan, and the heroic deeds in the war of resistance, all of which can be compiled into easy-to-understand teaching materials. Then, conduct arduous and planned work, educating them in various ways.</p>
<p>(3) The organization of education, in addition to general elementary schools, should take villages as units to organize women's literacy classes, poor people's literacy classes, or night schools, etc. Secondly, there are also villages as units to organize national salvation rooms, national revolution rooms, national revival rooms, etc., designating appropriate personnel to be responsible for leading the masses to hold discussions, report on the war situation in various places, and explain the stories and deeds of national heroes (such as the revolutionary deeds of Sun Yat-sen and how Zhang Yuefei and Qin Hui were different, etc.), organize anti-Japanese pictorials and intelligence, and provide the masses with learning opportunities at any time. In addition, you can also organize forums, organize intellectuals, discuss specific work, and conduct mass education.</p>
<p>(4) Education for backward elements is more difficult and requires patient guidance in order to win over the broad masses to the anti-Japanese front.</p>
<p>(H) Experiences in mass movement work:</p>
<p>(1) There must be extensive democracy in order to mobilize the masses and organize the masses. The affairs of the masses must be decided by the masses themselves. Those who lead the work must not forget this. They must listen to the opinions of the masses and help them, not "do everything for them," which hinders their self-awareness and sense of responsibility. If there is no such system and style, and everything is done by command, it will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>(2) Don't be satisfied with empty plans and calls. Planning is one thing, and realizing it among the masses is another. The distance between the two is still far. If you want the plan to become an actual action, you must work hard and do the mass work bit by bit patiently and deeply in order to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>(3) Understand the urgent demands of the masses and solve every specific problem for them. If actual problems can be solved, the mass work can naturally achieve success. Otherwise, empty promises that cannot be cashed will inevitably lead to failure.</p>
<p>(4) Pay attention to cultivating and promoting cadres from various social professional groups. Only these cadres can deeply understand their urgent demands, are suitable for their living habits, and can have close relationships. Otherwise, those appointed from above will be out of touch, and naturally the work cannot be successful.</p>
<p>(5) The cadres who do mass work, no matter what party or faction they belong to, must go deep into the masses, humbly learn from the masses, understand their specific problems, and stand in the ranks of the masses to lead the masses forward. If they are aloof and put on official airs, the result will definitely be failure.</p>
<p>The above sections are all about mass movement work. The reason why we talk about the masses first is that we believe that resistance against Japan and national reconstruction all depend on the masses. If we do not believe in the masses, despise the masses, and the way of working is not changed, then I can say with certainty that resistance against Japan will encounter more difficulties or even disadvantages. Today, mobilizing the masses and organizing the masses is entirely for the purpose of resisting Japan. To achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance, we must mobilize the masses and organize the masses, which is the correct and reliable method.</p>
<p>B. Opposing traitors and fighting against the puppet troops.</p>
<p>Opposing traitors is to prevent Chinese from fighting Chinese, and disintegrating the puppet troops is to destroy the Japanese and weaken the Japanese.</p>
<p>A. The situation of traitors operating under the instigation of the Japanese.</p>
<p>(a) Carrying out pseudo-organizations under the guise of anti-Japanese slogans, such as the "×× National Salvation Army" and "Anti-Japanese Army." Because the masses have deep hatred for the Japanese, organizing the "Royal Collaboration Army" will inevitably be opposed by the masses. Therefore, they use the slogan of "resistance against Japan" to deceive people. When the masses are absorbed and organized, they claim to be "self-defense," and the slogan they put forward is "Japanese soldiers don't hit us, we don't hit Japanese soldiers." They also say, "Our army can't defeat Japanese soldiers, so we use self-defense. Japanese soldiers don't come, we don't fight Japanese soldiers." The latter are deceived by them and echo them. Then they go on to propose, "We don't let the Japanese come, and we don't let the Chinese soldiers come." In this way, the Japanese achieve their goal. Because of the deception of the traitors, it facilitates the insufficient distribution of the Japanese army's forces. Moreover, if the Chinese army comes, they will resist. This further achieves the Japanese goal of "Chinese fighting Chinese." The poisoning of their attempts to undermine the anti-Japanese determination of the masses and destroy the anti-Japanese forces in China is evident from this. In addition, there are also two brothers, one in the anti-Japanese army and one in the Royal Collaboration Army. If the anti-Japanese army wins, the older brother protects the younger brother, and if the resistance against Japan fails, the younger brother protects the older brother. Moreover, some traitors have been appointed by both the Chinese and Japanese sides and have both the Blue Sky White Sun flag and the Rising Sun flag. When the Japanese army comes, they raise the Rising Sun flag, and when the Chinese army comes, they raise the Blue Sky White Sun flag. These facts are exemplified by Yang Yukun in southern Hebei. It is very painful to hear, but in fact, these tricks can easily confuse the masses and deceive them.</p>
<p>(b) Using feudal superstitious organizations, such as the Red Spear Society, the Lu Yi Society, and the White Spear Society, all of which claim to be self-defense, but in fact help the Japanese.</p>
<p>(c) Recently, the Japanese in China have put forward the slogan of achieving overall peace through partial peace and compromise and signed non-aggression treaties with the masses to remedy the difficulty of insufficient troop distribution. They say that the Japanese army does not rob, does not rape, and does not burn houses, but the common people must also guarantee that the Central Army and the Eighth Route Army will not fight the Japanese army. Then they can use a small number of troops to guard a place (such as reducing a regiment to a platoon or a company.) At the same time, the Japanese have recently proposed the so-called "30% military, 70% political" to deceive backward people. Recently, they have even shamelessly put forward such slogans as "fight back to the motherland" and realize Sun Yat-sen's "Pan-Asianism."</p>
<p>(d) Sowing discord, undermining unity, spreading the atmosphere of peace, trying to eliminate the anti-resistance sentiments of our people, inciting and tempting the people to overthrow the anti-Japanese army. In many places, the puppet Royal Collaboration Army wears the Eighth Route Army's insignia, pastes slogans, establishes "Soviets," and implements land revolution and proletarian dictatorship to undermine the feelings between the Eighth Route Army and the people. Sometimes, when they meet the Central Army, they say that they only fight the Communist army and not the Central Army. When they meet the guerrillas, they say that they only fight the regular army and not the guerrillas. However, when they meet the regular army, they say that they only fight the guerrillas. The North China army and the people have generally gained a further understanding of these intrigues of the Japanese, but there are still a few people whose understanding is vague and need patient explanation.</p>
<p>B. Our Countermeasures</p>
<p>Since the Japanese are playing their tricks in this way and trying to undermine our war of resistance, then how should we deal with them?</p>
<p>(a) Raise the people's national self-esteem and confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance, as well as the perseverance to overcome difficulties. Indeed, we have reduced our national self-esteem and self-confidence under the aggression of imperialism in the past, insulting ourselves, saying things like "sick man of East Asia" and "inferior nation," thinking that we are not capable. In fact, our Chinese nation is an excellent nation in the world, with many excellent deeds worthy of praise to educate the people. The experience and lessons of the eighteen months of resistance against Japan are also sufficient to improve national self-confidence and enhance the perseverance to overcome difficulties. At the same time, we must be good at grasping every specific fact and exposing the conspiracies and sowing discord of the Japanese traitors to create hatred among the people for the Japanese traitors. In this way, we in North China can make the Japanese have nowhere to use their schemes. The orders of the provisional government in Beiping can only reach the vicinity of the Summer Palace, and in other places, they cannot be reached and are also ineffective. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 15th] The Japanese troops entrenched in Yanglei (Qinyang) were fiercely counter-attacked by one of our regiments on the morning of the 10th. After a fierce battle until noon, the Japanese troops could not withstand it and fled back to Lishi in a panic via Xibaizhenzhu. They were intercepted by our forces at every turn along the way, and many were killed or captured.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 5th] Activities on all fronts of the Sino-Japanese War have become greatly active recently. The Chinese army in Shanxi is now attacking Linfen. The Chinese army near Hengyang is stepping up its encirclement of the city, making rapid progress. The Japanese army commander has sent an urgent telegram requesting reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 14th] Over a thousand Japanese troops from Fengshan, Longpan, and Chongyi, east of Qinyang, invaded Daxian, Caocun, and Wangli in two directions on the 9th. One of our units fought bravely to respond. At noon, they used their main force to outflank from the flank, repelling the Japanese troops who had invaded eastern and western Wangli. Our forces are currently contacting the frontal troops to wipe out the Japanese troops. In addition, the Japanese troops in Xibaizhen, west of Qinyang, have suffered heavy losses from repeated attacks by our army and have mostly fled to Qinyang.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Tense Situation in Western Shanxi <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Special Chongqing Dispatch from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the battle situation in Central and Southern China has temporarily appeared quiet. The enemy, with its exhausted troops, has been blocked by us in Central China along the Yueyang-Tongcheng line, and confronted us in Southern China in areas such as Sanshui and Conghua, unable to advance for a long time. However, the enemy will not cease its military aggression. Therefore, after failing to advance in Central and Southern China, it has shifted its aggressive objectives to the Northwest as a priority.</p>
<p>The Northwest is an important base for us to conduct the War of Resistance in North China. For more than a year, the enemy has repeatedly attempted to cross the river to invade westward. However, due to our consolidated river defenses in eastern Shaanxi and the strong resistance of our troops in central Shanxi, the enemy's sweeping plans in southeastern Shanxi and Wutai have been shattered. Moreover, the enemy's attempt to cross the river to invade Shaanxi has also become a pipe dream.</p>
<p>However, although the enemy has suffered heavy blows, it has not abandoned its intention to cross the river. Not only has it not abandoned it, but also, due to the stability of our military in the two northern provinces, it is even more eager to accelerate the realization of its wild plan. Since the middle of last month, the enemy has concentrated a large army, totaling about 20,000 men, in the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, actively invading westward in five routes. One route, based on Fenyang and Xiaoyi, is advancing northward from Dui Jiugu and Maijiao, towards Shilou and Xinhedu, and southward towards Xixian. Another route, based on Linfen, is advancing from Shimenli and Longguan, invading Pu County and Daning. One route is invading westward from Xiangling, and also turning north towards Heilongguan. Another route, based on Quwo, Houma, and Xinjiang, is occupying Quanzhang, Sanquan, and other places, aiming to reach Yumen. One route, based on Hejin, is attacking Yumen with its main force. The enemy's main intention is clearly to use its main force to advance westward, hoping to find a crossing point to invade eastern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Since the 2nd and 5th of last month, fierce battles have unfolded in the western Shanxi area. The enemy is trying to advance rapidly, and has successively captured Pu County, Daning, Xiangning, Ji County, Shilou, and other places. However, our army has long had strict deployments on both sides of the Yellow River. The Shanxi-Shaanxi front stretches for a thousand miles along the Yellow River, and we have also taken strict precautions at all important crossings. Therefore, it is difficult for the enemy to occupy Yumen and other places at once, but they have been given a head-on blow by our army, and we have recovered Chuowo, Shijiatan and other places in Yumen. At the same time, our extensive guerrilla forces are extremely active in western Shanxi, and the relationship between the army and the people is also very good. Although the enemy's adventurous westward invasion has temporarily succeeded, our army is using new strategies, not only focusing on blocking the front, but also paying more attention to flanking and severely attacking the enemy's rear and flanks. The enemy wants to accelerate its westward advance, while our army is flanking it from both the north and south, and at the same time using extensive guerrilla forces to cut off its rear lines of communication, making it unable to attend to both ends. If the enemy wants to advance, its rear will be attacked; if it wants to ensure the safety of its rear, it has to stop its advance. As a result, our army recovered Ji County and Daning on the 8th, annihilating more than 4,000 enemy troops, and recovered Pu County and Xiangning on the 10th, annihilating more than 3,000 enemy troops. At the same time, we took the opportunity to recover Wucheng Town and attacked Lishi Town, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, which was in utter disarray. Judging from the current situation in western Shanxi, our army has clearly achieved a major victory. This victory is really due to the skillful cooperation between the regular army and the guerrilla forces, the widespread mobilization of the army and the people, the appropriate application of strategy, and the heroic fighting of our countless soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>However, we must never be arrogant because of the small victories we have achieved recently. The enemy's attack on western Shanxi is only a beginning. In the near future, the enemy will obviously intensify its offensive on the northwestern battlefield, and the situation in western Shanxi will inevitably become more tense. Because of this, it naturally increases our task of defending the Northwest.</p>
<p>To defend the Northwest, we must strengthen the defense of Shanxi. Shanxi is the vanguard of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, and it is an important pivot for the War of Resistance in North China. The reason why the enemy does not dare to risk crossing the river to invade westward is not because it does not have the power to cross the river, but because we still control a considerable amount of military force in Shanxi, which makes it have to be concerned. Therefore, to protect Shaanxi and Gansu in the west, we must strengthen the defense of Shanxi, strengthen the political work of the guerrilla forces behind the enemy, improve the relationship between the army and the people, and at the same time strengthen domestic unity. This is especially important in the Northwest.</p>

<p>[Reuter's Chongqing, 15th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek declared yesterday that China cannot and will not make peace with Japan. "I recently went to several front lines to inspect the situation. The soldiers and people on the front lines are prepared for hardship. I have not heard any indication that they are willing to make peace. Only far behind the front lines do some weaklings make suggestions for peace."</p>
<h3 id="e6">Wu Zhihui Talks About Wang Jingwei: Blood Pressure Too High Can Easily Cause Mental Illness; Chamberlain Is Good at Tai Chi <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Special Chongqing Dispatch] At 3:30 PM on Sunday, January 8th, this reporter had just left the YMCA annual meeting when I saw an old man with a shiny head, wearing a felt hat, a long gown and a black mandarin jacket, and shoes with patched heels, looking around and walking slowly. One look told me that he was Mr. Wu Zhihui. Mr. Wu's talks are loved by the world, so this reporter could not easily let him go. I immediately turned around and followed closely behind, hoping to find an opportunity to talk with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu ran to the YMCA guest nameplate and looked at it for a long time, then went towards the east side of the hostel with a soft sound. However, the number that Mr. Wu was looking for could not be found. Then he knocked on the door of a room in the west side of the hostel. The door opened and Mr. Wu went in, closing the reporter out. At this time, there were two bodyguards who looked like wealthy people, who followed Mr. Wu as closely as the reporter did. The reporter suspected that Mr. Wu was suddenly taken care of greatly in Chongqing.</p>
<p>After the indifferent Sichuan tea boy put the reporter's business card in, Mr. Wu ran out of the door and invited the reporter inside. The owners of the room were Mr. Li and Mr. Gao. Seeing the reporter entering, they were all smiles. The reporter asked Mr. Wu about his health, and we started chatting.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's kind triangular eyes made him lovable. His impression of Chongqing was that oranges were very cheap. When talking about international issues, he said that British Prime Minister Chamberlain was smart and fierce, like someone who is good at playing Tai Chi. He cooperated with Eden as a partner. On the surface, he said that Britain did not dare to clash with Japan, but in reality, Eden and his like were actively engaged in large-scale activities. Chamberlain wanted to unite with other countries, but it was all a delaying tactic.</p>
<p>The reporter asked him about his thoughts after Mr. Wang Jingwei left. Mr. Wu said: "Mr. Wang's betrayal of the party can be forgiven, but his betrayal of the country cannot be forgiven. Mr. Wang has high blood pressure and often has mental illnesses, but this mental illness is really unforgivable. When the decision to resist Japan was made years ago, Mr. Wang was also one of the decision-makers. Today, his betrayal is incomprehensible." The reporter asked him whether the rumor that Mr. Wang was going to Shanghai to hold a Fifth National Congress was true or not. Mr. Wu said: "Mr. Wang can do such things, what else can't he do? Not only Shanghai, he may also go to Nanjing. However, once Mr. Wang leaves the central government, he is no longer important. The likes of Tang Yuhe and Wang Kemin, who are quite mediocre, can also play the main role, but the puppet organization is all uncertain, so what can Mr. Wang do!"</p>
<p>The reporter then asked Mr. Wu if he could reveal one or two of the important proposals to be discussed at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be held on the 20th of this month. Mr. Wu said that the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee would probably be held around the 15th of this month (the following paragraph is omitted).</p>
<p>When talking about Mr. Wu's personal life, he said that he likes to run around every day, go to teahouses, and rarely takes sedan chairs. "When I (Mr. Wu referring to himself) go to a teahouse, newspaper reporters say that I am investigating public opinion, which is making a fuss over a trifle. In fact, sometimes I buy some things and sort them out in the teahouse. There is no talk of investigating public opinion."</p>
<p>Because I was afraid of delaying Mr. Wu's valuable time, I said goodbye and left. Walking out of the YMCA, I felt that Mr. Wu had not aged at all in the year or so of the war of resistance, but he was more careful when speaking. (He Dong)</p>

<p>[Jueyu Society, Yunxian Express News] After Chairman Li Hanhun of the Provincial Government also took on the position of Commander-in-Chief of Guerrillas for the whole province, he decided to reorganize the 22 guerrilla zones in the whole province into nine major zones, with the administrative commissioners concurrently serving as guerrilla commanders. He has already issued orders to implement this plan, and has also telegraphed the guerrilla commanders, stating that before the administrative inspectors of each zone take office, they should still be responsible for hosting all military affairs. At the same time, Chairman Li carefully considered the candidates for the administrative commissioners of each zone, and decided to fill the positions with personnel who have military and political knowledge, experience, and reputation, and to adapt to wartime needs. He has newly selected nine commissioners for each zone and requested the Central Government to appoint them. He has also requested Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone to appoint 18 deputy commanders for the newly divided guerrilla zones.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 15th Special Dispatch] American reporter Hanson, who has traveled throughout China for three years, returned to the United States the previous week. When passing through Tokyo, he gave a speech to an American business newspaper, saying that China's greatest strength lies in the unity of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and General Bai Chongxi with General Zhou Enlai, leading the country and vowing never to compromise with the Japanese enemy. The newspaper also praised our country's recent strengthening of the united anti-Japanese front and political progress. China's policies during the War of Resistance, which surprised foreign observers, were the establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation. Their organizers were all former professors or technical experts from specialized schools, and many of them were once at odds with the country's leaders before the war. The famous geologist Weng Wenhao is an outstanding example. He is definitely not someone who parrots others' opinions. His assumption of office during the war may be the beginning of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in modern history.</p>

<p>[External News from This Port] According to news from Shamian, yesterday morning, the Chinese Air Force suddenly bombed Japanese ships docked in the Pearl River, sinking two Japanese ships. Although this news is from Guangzhou, which is in the hands of the Japanese, it cannot be verified. However, the Chinese Air Force's activities in South China have clearly been strengthened.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 15th] A large-scale battle is likely to occur in South China. The enemy army is most likely to attack Wuzhou along the West River. The enemy has concentrated troops, artillery, and aircraft in the area, and a major battle is expected soon. Chinese aircraft flew to Guangdong last Friday and today to drop bombs, causing heavy damage to enemy artillery positions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, News from This Port] According to a visitor from Boluo, the people of the Huizhou-Boluo area in East River were completely recovered by us at the beginning of last month. During the period when Huizhou-Boluo was occupied, the armed people in various places, together with the regular army, constantly attacked the enemy, making the enemy exhausted and unable to gain a foothold, and had to abandon Huizhou-Boluo and retreat to the Shilong area. Recently, the Guangdong military authorities, considering that the mountains in the Huizhou-Boluo area are important and the people are brave and strong, making it the best guerrilla base in the East Road, specially expanded the various units of the Detachment and the self-defense corps that bravely resisted the war into the East River Detachment, ordering them to take on assault tasks at any time. Their strength is very strong, and they have now advanced to the vicinity of Shilong, coordinating with other friendly teams to attack the enemy from time to time, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. However, it is said that the team lacks cotton clothing, raincoats, medicines, and military blankets, and it is hoped that all parties can provide assistance to encourage them.</p>

<p>[Jueyu Society, West River Express News] The military situation on the West River was tense before because the enemy army actively reinforced various places southwest of Sanshui and Makou, attempting to encircle and invade westward towards our Gaoyao and Sihui areas. However, because our defenses were strong, the enemy did not dare to advance rashly. Now our side has taken the initiative on the West River, and the enemies southwest of Sanshui and Makou are being closely monitored. Since the enemy army's fierce attack on Jinlintou failed on the 8th, they have been lying low in a corner, not daring to move. In the past week, in addition to the enemy army harassing and looting in various villages and our guerrilla teams attacking the enemy, there have only been minor contacts. Currently, the war on the West River is developing from the inside out. Our army has actively deployed, waiting for the opportunity to counterattack the enemy. The outbreak of a major battle is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Our Reinforcements Are Steadily Increasing Defenses <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Gaoming, Sihui, Gaoyao, Yunfu, Xinxing, and Deqing counties on the West River have long been heavily guarded, with solid defenses. Recently, Li Hanhun's troops have been steadily returning to reinforce the east and west of the West River to participate in the battle. According to military news, two units of Li Hanhun's troops arrived in San Shui Lubao via the North River yesterday, and were stationed in the areas of Sihui Datang and Jiang'an, to monitor the enemy southwest of Jiangtang, Sanjiang, and Guanxian. Once they establish contact with friendly forces and local teams, they will immediately launch an annihilating battle against the remaining enemy in the Sanjiang and Guanmi areas. It is reported that the two units were originally tasked with advancing eastward along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road to take Guangzhou. In addition, two divisions of the Guilin Army have recently moved east and arrived in the Gaoyao, Gaoming, and He Mountains to be responsible for guarding and preventing the enemy from crossing the West River to invade.</p>

Their strength is very strong. Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone recently appointed Xia Cheng, the commander of a certain army, as the commander-in-chief of the Western Route. Xia has already arrived and, after visiting the two commanders Zhang (Fakui) and Yu (Hanmou), immediately returned to a certain place in western Guangdong to preside over everything. According to military news, Xia has now handed over the responsibility for commanding the local teams in the various counties of the West River to Xu Jingtang. In order to discuss the new defense arrangements and counterattack plans for the West River with Xu, Xia has specially scheduled a meeting with Xu Jingtang and the commanders of the various units on a certain day to discuss all offensive and defensive strategies, so that the counterattack operations on the Western Route will advance simultaneously with the northeastern routes.</p>

<h3 id="e20">My Gift from Guangxi <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Hanzhi</p>
<p>During my recent trip to Guangxi, I tasted the most exquisite wines, surpassing those from any other country. However, the gift I bring back is not wine but something even better: the new spirit of Guangxi and the power it can unleash.</p>
<p>Before going to Guangxi, I met with two leaders there and learned two things.</p>
<p>At the headquarters of the Fifth War Zone, after about ten aircraft flew past, I asked Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren: How many soldiers has Guangxi mobilized? He replied: Four hundred thousand. I quickly calculated that Guangxi, with a population of only thirteen million, had already sent out four hundred thousand soldiers. If every province were like Guangxi, based on the national population of four hundred and fifty million, we should have one million four hundred thousand soldiers to defend our country. Not only would Wuhan not need to be abandoned, but Nanjing might not have fallen. Commander-in-Chief Li said, I think so too.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, though ill in the East Lake Sanatorium, received me twice, both times discussing comprehensive tactics. This was a special term he coined for the second phase of the war of resistance. He said: Comprehensive tactics are a synthesis of attrition warfare, mobile warfare, and positional warfare. He put forward two key points: (1) Accumulate small victories into a major victory; (2) Exchange space for time. After receiving his instruction, I also proposed comprehensive education for discussion, and he also believed that only comprehensive education could meet the needs of comprehensive resistance and strive for overall victory.</p>
<p>I arrived in Guilin on November 21st and left Longzhou on December 23rd. Within Guangxi, what I want to report is my impression during these thirty-two days. During this period, there was the Weishan Conference, a major turning point in China. I personally witnessed Guangxi before and after the Weishan Conference. I personally saw Guangxi become active during this major turning point.</p>
<p>After the Weishan Conference, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and important generals successively arrived in Guilin. General Bai Chongxi arrived first. Guilin was already very cold in late December, but General Bai brought the warmth of the winter sun. He first informed us of the several guidelines put forward by Generalissimo Chiang at Weishan, such as prioritizing politics over military affairs, the people over soldiers, the rear over the front, and guerrilla warfare over positional warfare. How fortunate we were for the Republic of China at that time! Mr. Zhou Enlai, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, arrived. He informed me of the policy of integrating military, political, and cultural affairs in the guerrilla areas as decided in Hengshan, and said: If this policy is implemented, it can avoid all friction and sufficiently turn defense into an offensive opportunity, giving the Japanese army a fatal blow. Later, General Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone and concurrently Director of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, also came. He told me face-to-face, Now we have a standard. The success of the Political Department depends on the quality of the army, and the quality of the army depends on the opinion of the people. If the people say a certain army is good, it is really good; if the people say a certain army is bad, it is really bad. Secondly, he told me the new slogan of the Political Department: Propaganda is education; service is propaganda. Only serving the people is true propaganda. In this way, those stereotyped propaganda clichés are useless.</p>
<p>Guangxi is moving forward in great strides in the harmony of these new ideas. Guangxi wants to implement these ideas swiftly to protect the Great Southwest and to defend China. In this major turning point, what we first see is that Guangxi's politics are moving towards democratization. The most grassroots organization in Guangxi, the village and street people's assembly, already exists. Now, they are busy establishing township people's representative assemblies and county provisional councils. After the county provisional councils are established, provincial councils will be established in an orderly manner. This major event is being carried out bravely under the leadership of Chairman Huang Xuchu. Lei Gu, the Director of Civil Affairs, said to me: A nation without its people is not a nation, and people without organization are as good as no people. If we want to save the country, we must quickly organize the people. Not only Guangxi needs the organization of the people, but all the people of the country must quickly organize. We can say that the political structure of Guangxi is advancing towards democratization.</p>
<p>Guangxi's political operation is very efficient. After the big bombing on November 22nd, the methods for rescuing the victims and refugees were posted all over the city within two hours. Where to stay and where to receive relief funds were all announced. Those with relatives could temporarily stay with them. If relatives refused, the victims could sue their relatives. Mutual assistance in emergencies is not an abstract virtue but a legal obligation. When encountering the elderly and young blocking the way during air raids, young people have the obligation to give way and help carry them. This should also become an unwritten law.</p>
<p>Dispersing the population has recently become an important policy. The government suspected the instructions, so they followed along to inspect several places and found them to be as stated in the notices. Only then did they move from suspicion to admiration.</p>
<p>Speaking of military affairs, when Guangzhou fell, Guangxi was somewhat empty. After General Bai arrived, he transferred fresh troops on one hand, trained new recruits on the other, and universally organized strike teams. By the time I left, Guangxi was very stable. I passed through Lipu, Liujiang, Liuzhou, Luxu, Nanning, Longzhou, and Zhennanguan from Guilin, and every day at dawn, I saw or heard the sound of men drilling. Recently, they have been practicing how to fight guerrilla warfare. It is said that as of the time I left Longzhou, there were more than 500,000 soldiers who could fight, and the number continued to increase. These soldiers who are training are waiting for the Japanese army to come, and some are impatient and want to rush to Guangdong to help. If the Japanese warlords are not afraid of breaking their noses, they can come to Guangxi and try. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e21">League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting to Discuss Sanctions Against Japan; Britain Issues Strong Note to Japan; Far Eastern Policy Parallels the US <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 15th] The League of Nations Administrative Council will hold a meeting tomorrow. The main items on its agenda are the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain and the Chinese request to sanction Japan. The latter was placed on the agenda for discussion at China's urgent request.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The diplomatic correspondent of "The Sunday Times" said, "The new note sent by Britain to Japan is approximately two thousand words long, and its language is strong (stronger than any previous British note since the start of the Sino-Japanese War). It clarifies Britain's policy and reiterates in the most formal manner its adherence to the principles of 'Open Door' and 'Equal Opportunity.' It cannot agree to unilateral actions to revise the Nine-Power Treaty, but it will consider constructive negotiations to amend the treaty. The result of this note is to bring British policy into line with the note presented by the United States to Japan on October 27th of last year. The British and American notes are not completely identical, but the principles of both sides are essentially the same. Although the British note does not contain threats of retaliatory action, such action is not absolutely impossible, but drastic measures will not be taken at present."</p>
<p>Hu Shih-tse's Remarks</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 15th] Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese ambassador to Switzerland, gave a lengthy interview to a reporter from this agency, stating briefly that President Roosevelt's message to Congress is extremely relevant to the requests China has made to the League of Nations. The Chinese issue has already been included in the League Council's agenda. Ambassador Gu Weijun will speak to the Council about the situation in the Far East and will request the Council to resolve the Chinese issue based on previous resolutions. Hu also stated that since the last Council adjournment, the US government has repeatedly expressed a strong stance on the increasingly dangerous situation in the Far East. As for what kind of impact the attitude expressed by the US President will have on the resolution of this League Council meeting, it is difficult to predict. China's resistance has lasted for eighteen months, and governments and peoples of various countries have clearly recognized China's determination to resist for the long term. Japan has repeatedly stated that it respects the interests of various countries in China, but the various illegal actions of the Japanese army in the occupied areas of China prove that Japan has completely destroyed the interests of various countries in China. Hu concluded by saying that the Chinese people hope that governments of various countries will protect their own interests in China and should not rely solely on China itself to fight for the protection of the interests of various countries.</p>
<h3 id="e22">British Newspapers Emphasize German-Polish Talks; Hitler Decides to Demand Colonies <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The Sunday editions of newspapers here attach great importance to the Hitler-Beck meeting. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Sunday Times" said that the meeting was extremely important because Hitler's conversation revealed the outline of Hitler's 1939 plan. Hitler told Polish Foreign Minister Beck that he would not intensify pressure on Danzig and Memel in the near future, nor would he force Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Ukrainian question would also not be handled through aggression. Hitler also stated that Poland should pay close attention to the split of the Soviet Union in the next two to three years, but would not participate until the time was ripe. The main point of the Hitler-Beck meeting was the colonial issue. Hitler supported Poland in immediately applying for colonies and at the same time allowed Colonel Beck to observe the impact of Hitler convening a colonial conference before the end of the year. A Warsaw correspondent for the "Observer" said that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop originally intended to visit Poland in March, but it has been changed to late January due to the new situation determined by Hungary joining the Anti-Comintern Pact and Germany also planning to join. A Warsaw correspondent for "The Sunday Times" said that diplomatic circles believe that the Franco-Polish alliance is undergoing extremely drastic changes, and only a miracle can save it.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Main Achievements of the Rome Talks: Both Sides Willing to Maintain Peace; Britain Hopes for Improved Franco-Italian Relations; Germany Denies Mediating Disputes <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Although senior British officials have stated that there are still differences of opinion between the two countries, they have also proven the traditional friendship between the two countries. Although the current international situation does not allow any new agreements to be signed, relations between the two countries have been placed on a solid foundation of mutual respect. Italy feels that Britain has expressed appropriate importance to the achievements under the fascist system. One of the main gains of this meeting was the mutual respect among the participants in the talks and the emergence of goodwill between Chamberlain and Mussolini. Such private, harmonious relations can be expected to benefit the progress of discussions when the European situation requires them to discuss matters together. Chamberlain and Mussolini are unwilling to risk their countries in wars without any benefit, and both are determined to safeguard the interests of their nations and nationalities. There is no conflict between Britain and Italy. If the spirit of this meeting is applied to other disputes, various disputes will not threaten European peace. Britain is eager to improve relations between France and Italy, but does not want to abandon its allies in any way. This does not mean that Britain opposes the German-Italian axis, but hopes that the strength of the German-Italian axis will turn towards peaceful proposals, in which Western European democracies can also participate. Before leaving Italy, Chamberlain issued a joint statement saying that politicians from both countries had exchanged opinions frankly and in a very harmonious atmosphere and had decided to develop relations between the two countries in the spirit of friendship stipulated in Article 16 of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. The desire of both countries is to implement this policy to maintain peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th] Responsible individuals here recently declared that members of the British delegation have stated that cabinet members of their country are satisfied with this trip. Prime Minister Mussolini's attitude was sincere and just, which is most noteworthy. No explicit demands were made regarding the Suez Canal's management rights and the French port of Djibouti in East Africa. His words and actions avoided anything that could cause difficulties. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini voluntarily stated that he would earnestly fulfill the various provisions of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, the plan for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers passed by the Non-Intervention Committee, and that he would promote a policy of peace in order to leisurely develop the natural resources of his country and its colonies. The British cabinet members also expressed their gratitude to Mussolini for his contribution to the Munich Conference in September of last year. This conversation involved political and economic issues, but no agreement was reached. This was originally expected by the British side. The British cabinet members' trip was intended to discuss the general situation and did not anticipate any concrete results. Now that Britain and Italy have clarified their positions and the foundation for peace has been solidified, it is a good thing. In addition, both sides exchanged views on the issue of arms reduction, but did not seek any constructive solutions. Regarding the issue of accommodating Jewish refugees, Mussolini stated that he was willing to cooperate with Britain. The British cabinet members also discussed it when they visited the Pope.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 15th] Regarding this Anglo-Italian talk, while circles in London and Paris believe there were no achievements, political circles here do not think so. According to a spokesperson, it is a gratifying thing that politicians are now holding direct talks to understand each other's positions, and this habit has shown progress. This approach is more effective.</p>
<p>French Fleet Practices; Italy Considers Negotiations</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 15th] French authorities announced that three submarines have been ordered to sail to Syria immediately, and the Mediterranean Fleet has also sailed to the North African coast to participate in "winter exercises." The Atlantic Fleet has also been ordered to move out at the same time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Part of the French Mediterranean Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet will conduct joint exercises in the Casablanca area this month.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] General Gamelin and Vice Admiral Darlan are scheduled to go to North Africa on the 19th to inspect Oran and Mers El Kébir in Algeria, and the coast of Morocco. Darlan will also inspect Dakar.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 15th] Newspapers commenting on the results of the Anglo-Italian talks stated that the attitudes of both Britain and Italy were to maintain the balance of power in the Mediterranean and the peace of Europe. Britain acknowledged Italy's progress and recognized the equal status of the Italian Empire. Both sides agreed that no other countries should acquire special status on either side of the Red Sea. "Il Messaggero" carried an exclusive report stating that Italy hopes to resolve Franco-Italian disputes through negotiations and does not want to resort to force.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th] "Il Telegrafo", known for reflecting Foreign Minister Ciano's views, published an important article today denying that Italy had invited Britain to mediate Franco-Italian disputes, and stated that Italy might consider direct negotiations with France. It stated that in January 1935, Italy signed an agreement with France because it was preparing to use force against Abyssinia. Afterwards, France did not keep its promises and instead participated in sanctions against Italy, which was wrong. To this day, Italy feels unwilling to reopen negotiations with France based on that agreement. This does not mean that Italy is absolutely in favor of war. Once France's attitude is calmer and no longer aggressive, Italy will seek other ways to resolve this issue. In short, once matters between France and Italy change, the Italian government does not object to reopening negotiations with France.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th] There are rumors that Hitler had asked Mussolini to try to maintain European peace for another year. The German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, issued a statement saying that the above statement was completely inaccurate. During British Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Italy, I did not have any indirect contact with the Italian government.</p>
<p>The Spanish Issue Is the Key to the Situation</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 15th] Authoritative sources declared that the Anglo-Italian meeting had no results and no new agreements. Chamberlain insisted on a policy of non-intervention in the Spanish war. Mussolini agreed to the second point, but did not accept the first point and had no "new demands." As for Mediterranean rights, he was still unwilling to easily relinquish them. Both sides had extensive talks, including important political and economic issues. The withdrawal of Italian volunteers from Spain was not discussed or decided in detail.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Gayda wrote in "Il Giornale d'Italia" today, "If foreign troops of the Spanish government army withdraw, Italy is also willing to withdraw its volunteers from Spain, but this issue must be resolved by the Non-Intervention Committee."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Here, a Rome correspondent for the "Frankfurter Zeitung" said, "The purpose of the British Prime Minister's visit to Rome was to promote the limitation of armaments, the humanization of warfare, and the maintenance of friendly relations between the four major European powers, but it failed to achieve its goals due to the disputes between France and Italy. The crux of the situation lies in the Spanish issue. If France is willing to stop its assistance to the Spanish government, the other issues between France and Italy will not be resolved. Prime Minister Mussolini must have asked Chamberlain to persuade France to change its attitude towards Spain."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Barcelona, 15th] The local official newspaper "La Vanguardia" expressed disappointment with the results of the Anglo-Italian talks in Rome. The newspaper said, "Mussolini has not yet abandoned his plan to subdue Spain. If Italy's imperial dream is successful, Spain will be reduced to a political and economic colony." The newspaper criticized the Spanish government army's general mobilization, saying, "The multitude of people can compensate for the enemy's material superiority. It is people, not materials, who determine the victory of war. The freedom that Spaniards love is in a dangerous situation. If necessary, we will call upon people from twelve to eighty years old to serve the country."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Suez Canal Company General Manager Bonnet reported at a board meeting of the company that Italy's demands for the Canal have aroused close attention in France. Bonnet said, "Recently, some people have advocated requiring the reorganization of the Suez Canal Company, which is tantamount to trying to eliminate our special interests in the Canal. However, this demand has been eased, and now there are only issues of expanding the board of directors and slightly increasing passage fees. The Egyptian government has long stated that the status of the Canal cannot be changed without Egypt's consent. The status of the Canal cannot be changed without the permission of the company. Our company will never allow anyone to infringe upon its rights. The Suez Canal will never change its status under threat."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] US Assistant Secretary of War Johnson gave a national radio address last night in support of the Weathersford national defense plan. It is said that the world is very likely to be engulfed in flames. Munich only exposed and highlighted the nature of this world crisis, but its crisis was long understood by various countries. Aggressors carefully select aggressive actions and locations, and avoid disputes with countries of equal or greater strength. From this point of view, the United States urgently needs to strengthen its national defense to safeguard its rights. Regarding Germany's plans during the European War (many of which have not been published), Johnson said that Germany at that time completely ignored the United States' participation in the war because they believed that the United States was weak and incompetent and not worth considering seriously. Therefore, Hindenburg and Ludendorff believed that the United States' participation in the war was not important. Now that the United States has strengthened its national defense, all countries know it, so it is our important task today to make ourselves feared by all people and to prevent them from harming the rights of the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e33">League of Nations Political Council to Meet Today <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council will convene in Geneva on the 16th. A significant item on the agenda for this meeting is the proposal to aid China through sanctions.</p>
<p>At the previous League of Nations conference, due to China's earnest appeal, a unanimous resolution was reached to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant and implement assistance to China in resisting Japanese aggression. Although this resolution did not immediately have a major effect, it is undeniable that China's international situation has subsequently improved significantly, while Japan has become increasingly mired in difficulties.</p>
<p>China's success in the previous conference was due to the valiant efforts of our representatives and the fervent support of righteous individuals within the League of Nations, such as the Soviet representative. However, the main reasons were: firstly, Japan's expansion in the Far East directly threatened the interests of European countries, especially Britain; and secondly, the united and unyielding spirit of China's resistance strengthened the confidence of the major powers in aiding China.</p>
<p>However, the past aid provided by various countries to China and sanctions against Japan have not been active enough. The assistance given to China has been like a drop in the bucket, and there have been no concrete measures taken to sanction Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this League of Nations General Assembly, we should not only strive for more practical and extensive assistance from various countries, especially in finance, medicine, military supplies, military raw materials, technical personnel, etc., but also strive to implement effective sanctions against Japan, especially boycotts, debt collection, and the cessation of military supplies and military raw materials to Japan. Only in this way can Japan be threatened, its aggression halted, and even if it recklessly takes risks, it will inevitably collapse more quickly. This is the common demand of righteous humanity and the sacred duty of the League of Nations to maintain world peace.</p>
<p>Given Japan's increasingly barbaric foreign policy, its growing antagonism with European and American powers, China's increasingly strong and united resistance, which has further increased the confidence of European and American powers in us, the recent expressions of active opposition to aggression by the United States, the trend of closer ties between Britain and the United States, and the failure of the Rome talks leading to greater cooperation between Britain and France, we firmly believe that our aforementioned urgent demands are realizable.</p>
<p>We now hope, on the one hand, that our representatives will fight even more valiantly for human justice and the glory of our motherland. On the other hand, we should also mobilize domestic and international public opinion and engage in national diplomacy, using various effective methods to urge the League of Nations to pass our strict and urgent demands.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Internal Strife Intensifies Within the Nazi Party <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 15th, Hitler will conduct another purge, dismiss several high-ranking Nazi leaders using pseudonyms, and execute many other officials. Propaganda Minister Goebbels will be dismissed this spring. Göring is attacking Ribbentrop for the negative international impact of the anti-Semitic policy and the responsibility for the deterioration of German-American relations. According to a Paris dispatch on the same day, the number of Germans who have fled to France due to party struggles has reached 100,000, and the number who have fled to other countries is even greater.</p>
<p>The exposure of the internal crisis within the fascist aggression front is not unexpected at a time when the international situation is gradually improving and the peace and democracy front is becoming more consolidated and developed. However, we must pay attention to how fascist dictators such as Hitler will resolve this kind of internal conflict and the widespread and intense internal mass opposition movement. There is no other way but to intensify their external wars. This is true of Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists. Therefore, we need to strengthen the anti-fascist people's front within the aggressor countries, and need to more actively and extensively organize the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement of righteous and peaceful people around the world.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Japan Again Issues Threats, Preparing to Sever Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union; Militarists' Arrogance Increases, Actually Believing the Soviet Union Dares Not Fight <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 15th] According to diplomatic circles, Soviet-Japanese relations have become increasingly dangerous since the Changkufeng Incident. The recent breakdown of fishery negotiations is the fuse for the current tense situation. Japanese authorities recently declared to reporters that Japan is prepared to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union unless the Soviet Union allows the Japanese demands to improve the fishery agreement. If the fishery agreement issue remains unresolved at the beginning of the fishing season, the severance of diplomatic relations will be realized in early April. Furthermore, the Japanese side has decided not to back down on fishing rights in Siberia and stated that if the fishery agreement cannot be improved, it will use force to protect fishermen going north to fish. The Japanese military authorities believe that the Soviet Union will definitely not (?) use force because of this. According to military sources, the Soviet Union is in conflict with Germany in Ukraine, so the Soviet side would definitely not dare to engage in a "larger dispute" with Japan. Japanese political circles believe that the prior withdrawal of Japanese envoys to the Soviet Union might shift the Soviet attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e36">On Soviet-Japanese Relations <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Ru</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese authorities actually declared to Associated Press reporters: "Japan is prepared to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union unless the Soviet Union allows the Japanese demands to improve the fishery agreement." The Soviet-Japanese fishery agreement issue has cast a shadow on recent Soviet-Japanese relations. We have repeatedly reviewed (see "The Development of the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Dispute" in this newspaper on December 23). That it would inevitably become the fuse for the most serious problem in Soviet-Japanese relations was within our judgment. Now, the Japanese aggressors intend to use this issue to act recklessly, which is worth our special attention.</p>
<p>The dispute over the fishery agreement has evolved to the current stage, ending the oral and written consultations and entering the time to express attitude and determination with practical actions. The terms of both the main and supplementary Soviet-Japanese fishery agreements expired last year. As a result of several breakdowns in negotiations between the two sides, the Soviet-Japanese fishery issue has become a state of no agreement. During the off-fishing season, not having an agreement doesn't matter, but when the fishing season arrives, this problem will become extremely serious. Examining the points of contention held by both the Soviet and Japanese sides and the course of their negotiations, it is very difficult for the Soviet-Japanese fishery issue to achieve a satisfactory outcome. What will happen when this issue evolves at the start of the spring fishing season is something that no one can predict, but based on the general international situation, our understanding of the Japanese side's remarks to reporters yesterday is about the following:</p>
<p>(1) This kind of statement by the Japanese military and political authorities has a very strong odor of intimidation. Japanese aggressors have always been accustomed to using this trick to deal with international issues, hoping to obtain great profits without investing capital. Most of the major historical gains from China have come from the effectiveness of this kind of intimidation. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities, under the absurd thought that "they believe the Soviet Union definitely does not dare to use force because of this," have released rampant opinions. However, intimidation can only be effective when the target is a coward. If the other party is a tough one, then the Japanese paper tiger will immediately shrink back. Our heroic resistance since August 13th has put the aggressors in a dilemma. Last year's Changkufeng Incident also gave them a deeper lesson. Today, when the Soviet Union is preparing to give the aggressors "two or three times the blow in return," the intimidation of the Japanese militarists will completely lose its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese aggressors are preparing to advance their gestures to attack the Soviet Union further. Japan's encirclement of the Soviet Union completely adopts the German-Japanese pincer attack strategy. They dare to challenge the Soviet Union because Germany and Italy are echoing them in the West. The Japanese military believes: "The Soviet Union is in conflict with Germany in Ukraine, so the Soviet side would definitely not dare to engage in a larger dispute with Japan," which is not without reason. However, this wishful thinking of the Japanese aggressors is also wrong. Our arguments are: (1) The Soviet Union's military equipment is complete enough to cope with attacks from both East and West aggressors; (2) Germany also has countless strong enemies in the West, such as Britain and France, which definitely cannot allow Germany to become stronger for long; (3) The political and economic difficulties within Germany severely restrict Hitler from going outside the "circle of intimidation." Ukraine is definitely not Czechoslovakia and cannot be obtained by intimidation. In this way, Japan's European horns will completely lose their effectiveness.</p>
<p>(3) This intimidation from the Japanese military and political authorities will probably not dare to rashly take practical action at present. After all, the intention is still nothing more than three purposes: first, to divert domestic attention to foreign issues, to alleviate current internal disputes, and to create an excuse to force Parliament to pass huge budget proposals and the General Mobilization Law implementation bill; second, to deceive the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France, so that their sanctions against Japan will be delayed, in order to alienate the more solid cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain, the United States, and France; and third, to confuse our correct understanding, in order to echo the traitor theories they have created and divide our resistance forces.</p>
<p>(4) The degree of Soviet-Japanese disputes will increase day by day. Even if "the severance of diplomatic relations at the beginning of the fishing season may not be realized in early April," it is possible that the dispute will evolve into a localized actual conflict. Japan claims: "If the fishery agreement cannot be improved, it will use force to protect fishermen going north to fish." But in the Soviet Union, not only will the fishery agreement not be revised as the Japanese side hopes, but also 40 military fishing zones will be recovered. In addition, Japan's current direction of capturing China is focused on the Northwest, and we are also actively preparing strong military forces to meet the Japanese. Then, the struggle in the Northwest will become more intense. The Northwest has close relations with the Soviet Union, and recently Sino-Soviet relations have been progressing day by day. Soviet assistance to China's resistance will be more active. Therefore, the Soviet-Japanese dispute will gradually be linked to the Sino-Japanese war. The day when Japan truly severs diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union will be realized at that time.</p>
<p>Let's see what other tricks the Japanese aggressors will come up with besides gesturing and intimidation?</p>

The declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>Death and Injury on Roads, Flesh and Blood Flying</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our China is facing a war. The affected people are all over the provinces. British people, based on the great way of neighborly love, for the good deed of disaster relief, the Mayor of London, running around, especially strong advocacy, founded in the British capital China Relief Society, benevolence righteousness, spread around the world. Now also set up in Hong Kong, Hong Kong and South China Branch Governor as the president, each gentleman serving duties, unanimous progress. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs invites all merchants to a meeting at the Secretary's Office to organize a fundraising committee. Twenty-five Hong Kong gentry merchants were immediately elected as standing committee members, and three chairmen and vice chairmen were elected. The donation committee then invites the leaders of various groups and social celebrities to take office. This is the beginning of the establishment, work should be more active, in order to increase fundraising efficiency. Alas, Xuan Huang war blood, filled the country, houses destroyed, how to be home, roads displaced, how to eat, and dead and injured on the road, flesh and blood flying, father crying for his son, woman crying for her husband, wailing everywhere, unbearable to hear and see, all compatriots, Ning Rong stand by, now fortunately Cheng branch leadership advocacy, fundraising donation, rescue drowning fire, dare not strive.</p>
<p>Donate One More Penny, Save One More Life</p>
<p>Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the War of Resistance has been more than a year. The number of donations raised in Hong Kong has reached several millions. Now that traffic is blocked and business is declining, even a good bow becomes a crossbow, but where duties lie, we must strive to do our best and be brave in doing what is right. We also hope that all sectors will continue to work hard. Moreover, the funds raised are exclusively for China relief, which is great for the refugees. The British are neighbors and are still concerned about this. We are of the same race, how can we stand idly by? If we do not hold, we cannot live up to the friendly aid of allied nations, and we are also ashamed of our own shame. Now, the compatriots in the mainland are dying and waiting for relief, and their lives are in the balance. What is expected is that the group will work together, without laziness or waste, and raise one more point of donation, that is, save one more side of life. A large tree has more shade, it is good to be a thousand chapters, and the division of Lianquan, even a spoonful, also knows sweetness. The people are the foundation of the country, refugees and wounded soldiers are equally important, and the resettlement of refugees is enough to lighten the government's worries. This is also what the Association should actively undertake. Zhan Yan Bang clan, meaning depressed sleeves, I would like to say, Xi Gongliang cha.</p>
<h3 id="e38">More Than 5,000 Printing Workers in Hong Kong Implement Long-Term Debt Repayment Campaign; Second Session of Union Officials Took Office Yesterday <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Printing Industry Workers Union, at the Delegates Assembly the other day, resolved to respond to the one-yuan debt repayment campaign, and resolved measures to promote it for a long time. The heads of each branch of the union were responsible for soliciting donations from each member, donating at least a small part of their income each month, and submitting it to the General Union for submission to the National Government through the Bank of China. It is found that the union has more than 5,000 members. If the promotion can be done properly, the results will be certain in the future. Also, the second session of the union officials held an inauguration ceremony yesterday. Among the guests present were educator Tao Xingzhi, the union's honorary consultant Du Qizhang, and many people from the press. Among the speakers were Tao Xingzhi and members of the union, who elaborated on the significance of national salvation and the one-yuan debt repayment campaign. The meeting did not end until 4:00 p.m. That evening, an entertainment party was held at the union.

<h3 id="e39">Someone is Planning to Open an Aircraft Factory in Hong Kong; 5 Million Has Been Raised and Land Has Been Requested from the Hong Kong Port Office; Work is Limited to Assembly, Raw Materials are Purchased from the United Kingdom and the United States <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong is an important terminal station for aviation in the Far East. In recent years, civil aviation has developed, and all businesses related to aviation have made great progress. Only the assembly plant is still lacking. According to reliable sources yesterday, someone in Hong Kong recently raised funds to set up an aircraft factory. The amount of shares raised is said to be 5 million yuan. The progress is quite mature. The Hong Kong government has also been requested to allocate a piece of land in a certain area of the New Territories as a site for the factory. However, the authorities have not yet made a definite indication as to whether or not to approve this request, and the initiators are actively proceeding. At the same time, personnel have been sent to the United Kingdom and the United States to order aircraft engines and all other important parts, preparing to start the factory. Now the progress is so urgent that this factory has a great possibility of being realized. It is also heard that the scope of work of the factory in the future will only be for assembly purposes. The engines and parts will be purchased from abroad and transported to Hong Kong, and the fuselage will be built in Hong Kong. The most difficult thing is the lack of a qualified aircraft inspector.</p>
<h3 id="e40">High-Altitude Guns Set Up All Over Hong Kong's Reservoirs; Strictly Preventing the Enemy from Destroying Drinking Water; If the Enemy Attacks, There is No Other Way Except Bombing; Throwing Bacteria and Poisonous Agents Can Be Eliminated <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The drinking water of Hong Kong residents depends entirely on the water stored in the reservoirs, which is no different from the lifeline of all residents in Hong Kong. In the event of war, protecting the reservoirs is indeed worthy of attention. The reporter asked this question to anti-aircraft expert Mr. Stielow Birkenes yesterday. According to him, the use of poison gas and bacteria in warfare is despised by civilized countries. The authorities have set up strong anti-aircraft guns to defend all reservoirs in Hong Kong. Even if a war breaks out,</p>
<p>If enemy aircraft attack the reservoirs as targets, the anti-aircraft guns will be able to keep them out of the reservoir area. If so, the enemy aircraft's flight altitude will increase, and it will be difficult to accurately drop bombs. Even if they hit, it will be a matter of luck. There are three ways to destroy the reservoirs other than direct bombing: (1) poison agents, (2) poison gas, and (3) bacteria. The most common method is to inject mustard gas or arsenic smoke into the reservoirs. However, after passing through the filter layer of the original equipment of the reservoirs, the mustard gas poison can be eliminated. The only thing that cannot be filtered is quality gas, because this kind of gas quality is transformed after dissolving in water, but the amount is very small. Large reservoirs in Hong Kong, such as the Jubilee Reservoir and the Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir, xxxxxxxxxxxxx cannot poison this. It is impossible to poison this. As for arsenic smoke, although there is no perfect defense method, this kind of poison gas is ideally terrifying, but it is very difficult to use in practice. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx What is worth worrying about is the small reservoirs that do not have filter layer equipment. However, the area of small reservoirs is not wide, the targets are few, and it is also difficult to drop bombs. After the mustard gas sinks to the bottom of the reservoir, because the bottom of the reservoir is lower than the outlets, even if it is hit, only a small amount of it will flow into each water pipe, but it can be eliminated by decomposition method. After the smoke is mixed into the reservoir, it has been proved by experiments that it can be eliminated by chemical methods immediately. Therefore, the authorities have made proper plans for the protection of Hong Kong's Guishui reservoirs during the war, so there is no need to worry.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Female Adoption Registration; Deadline Extended for Residents; Do Not Wait and See Any Longer <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Secretary for Chinese Affairs' Office is holding this time of adoption registration. Previously, residents were given an extension. If there are people raising adopted daughters, they must register at the office as soon as possible. If there are those who wait and see and do not register before the registration deadline, they will be severely punished. This matter has been seen in previous reports. Yesterday, according to an official of the office, there are still many residents in Hong Kong who have adopted daughters but have not registered with the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. In order to enable all slaveholders to register, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs has specially extended the registration period again, hoping that residents will not wait and see again, and register immediately, so as to avoid being punished after the deadline.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Fire in Wan Chai Hennessy Road; A Warehouse Destroyed; Mei Wo and Lin Wo Hing's Inventory Consumed by Fire; What Was Burned Were Water Pine Wood and Other Materials, Losses Amounting to Tens of Thousands <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>At this time of high winds and dry weather, fires occur frequently in various districts, almost every day. At around 2:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a large fire broke out again in Wan Chai Hennessy Road. What was burned was a warehouse, and the goods stored in it were flammable water pine wood and charcoal, so once it caught fire, it spread to various places and could not be saved. As a result, the entire building was destroyed, with losses amounting to as much as twenty to thirty thousand yuan. The adjacent building was also damaged by water. The fire was completely extinguished at 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Front and Rear Warehouses</p>
<p>The fire occurred at Warehouse No. 360 on Hennessy Road, near Tin Lok Lane, Wan Chai. The warehouse was an old-fashioned building with a wide area. The entire warehouse was divided into two parts. The front part was the warehouse of Mei Wo Company, storing water pine hat molds and water pine oranges. The rear part was the charcoal warehouse of Lin Wo Hing. Both were easily flammable. The Mei Wo warehouse was on Hennessy Road, with entrances and exits from the front door. Lin Wo Hing had entrances and exits from the back door. The manager of Mei Wo Company is named Zheng Liangjun. The warehouse is usually locked with an iron lock and unattended.</p>
<p>Fierce Fire</p>
<p>At 2:45 a.m. yesterday morning, it is not known why it was accidentally burned. When the fire was ignited, no one noticed it. It was not until it burned the internal goods and the flames flew out of the house that passers-by noticed it. They knocked on the door to inquire, but there was no response. The passers-by realized it was a fire and immediately blew their whistles to call the police, alarming nearby residents, who woke up in fright from their sleep. The police on duty nearby also arrived at the scene to investigate and immediately notified the Second Police Station to report to the Central Headquarters and the fire departments of various districts. The Wan Chai Fire Department was the first to send vehicles to the scene, and the Central Headquarters also dispatched two vehicles. At the same time, the police station also sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to maintain order. When the firefighters arrived, the fire had already burned through the entire warehouse. Because the goods in the warehouse were easy to burn, the fire was extremely fierce, and the night sky was illuminated red.</p>
<p>Losses Amounting to Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>Firefighters opened hoses and injected water at the front, rear, and sides of the warehouse. After about an hour, the fire was slightly suppressed. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the fire was completely extinguished. As a result, the entire building was burned. The Southern Automobile Company at No. 350 next door was also damaged by water. The total value of Mei Wo's inventory reached 20,000 yuan. Lin Wo Hing's inventory had more than 100 bags of charcoal, which had just been delivered the night before and was burned yesterday morning, with losses of more than 8,000 yuan. Mei Wo purchased insurance for 10,000 yuan, and Lin Wo Hing also purchased insurance for several thousand yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e43">In the Waters of Yangjiang Prefecture; Seven Fishing Boats Went Out to Sea to Fish; Tragically Bombed by Japanese Aircraft; Two Fishing Trawlers Killed More Than Sixty People; The Remaining Five Ships Suffered Countless Deaths and Injuries <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, there are still those who encounter bombings by Japanese aircraft. According to the Fishermen's Association, Mr. Cheung Chau member reported that the Li Daohua and Li Daoming brothers, fishermen of the fisherman, were driving two fishing trawlers out to sea to fish separately. When the boat was in the sea area of Donghu, Yangjiang Prefecture, they were about to cast their nets to catch fish. Several Japanese aircraft bombed Dongbanda, and those who bombed the destination inaccurately had four heavy bombs hit Li Daohua's fishing trawler. The fishing trawler was hit by bombs, with a loud noise, and blood and ship wood were flying around, broken arms and broken legs were floating with the sea, which was unbearable to see. In addition to his family members, there were a total of about 30 partners on Li Daohua's fishing trawler. The fishing trawler sank immediately after being bombed. Those who did not die in the bombing also died in the water. At the same time, Li Daoming's fishing trawler stopped at a distance from Li Daohua's fishing trawler. When the bombs were bombed, the entire sea was stirred by the huge force of the bombs. Then, the angry sea and huge waves rushed to Li Daoming's fishing trawler. Li Daoming's fishing trawler suffered misfortune and the entire ship capsized, drowning more than 30 people on the spot. In addition to these two ships, five other fishing boats were also unfortunately hit by the Japanese aircraft and sank three times. Unfortunately, the ship numbers and the names of the fishermen on the five other fishing boats are unknown, but when they were reduced by the single, xxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, there were few who were able to escape to the water, and approximately 60 to 70 deaths were calculated for Li Daohua's and Li Daoming's ships, but the other five boats, the other five ships, are difficult to count.</p>

<p>For the freedom and happiness of the nation, for the victory of the war of resistance, and to relieve compatriots in suffering, the singing girls of Tong Sai deeply understand the meaning of "even a humble woman has a responsibility." They have held five charity performances in the past, and have already established many achievements in the history of the national war of resistance.</p>
<p>Last night—the fourth evening—in order to raise more funds for the China Youth Relief Corps to send teams to serve at the front lines, they launched the sixth charity performance, resulting in another page of praiseworthy history being added.</p>
<p>The singing segment raised 2,940-odd yuan, and the flower sales segment raised more than 230 yuan, totaling more than 3,100 yuan. The creators of this historical material should be credited to the several chairpersons of the charity performance, Ms. Mei Lihua, Wan Hongnu, Bao Yudu, and Hua Yinghen.</p>
<p>A very tense election scene unfolded last night at the Tao Yuan Restaurant in Shek Tong Tsui, for the final summing up of the results, and simultaneously for the crowning of a Queen of Song, a Red Star of Song, and a Star of Song. The singing girls, for the sake of saving the country and their position, were all gearing up and competing eagerly.</p>
<p>Mei Lihua, Wan Hongnu, and Hua Yinghen all had the desire to win the championship, especially Wan Hongnu, whose voice was the loudest. Unexpectedly, when the results were announced, Mei Lihua bid 1,117 yuan and won the championship, being crowned "Queen of Song." Wan Hongnu bid 1,030 yuan, placing second, and was crowned "Red Star of Song." Dudu placed third, crowned "Star of Song." Hua Yinghen withdrew. It is said that she transferred most of her achievements to Mei Lihua's account to fulfill her good friend Mei Lihua's dream, but the reporter has not been able to verify whether this is true.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zheng Dezhi, the leader of the Youth Relief Corps, there will be a somewhat grand coronation ceremony in the near future. The singing girls originally put in their sincere efforts for the country, not for any honors, but as an encouragement for the future, this is certainly something that should be done.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Drama and Song Concert <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>For the Purpose of Building a Public Library</p>
<p>The Chinese Amateur School, which was only established in Kowloon two months ago, held a drama and song concert yesterday morning at the Ping An Theatre for the purpose of building a public library.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Xingzhi said in the school's special publication that he "used to run a library at Xiaozhuang called the 'No Bookworms Allowed Library'." But, on the one hand, he told bookworms not to come, and on the other hand, why did he want to run a library? He wanted "laborers" and "money-grubbers" to read more books to clear their minds and understand the world. But books are a tool... for use, for solving problems. One must not read them blindly. If we recognize this point, books are the best thing, and we will benefit infinitely from good books."</p>
<p>From this, we can get a glimpse of the purpose of the school's fundraising for a public library: to promote the spirit of providing spiritual nourishment to the public. In Hong Kong society, where the stench of money is everywhere and money-grubbers block the road, this is clearly a very necessary righteous act.</p>
<p>The Ping An Theatre is quite magnificent. In the flickering light, it appears even more beautiful and quiet. When the chairman delivered his speech, the vast circular hall was filled with a solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>The concert began with the national anthem. Over eighteen hundred people upstairs and downstairs stood in silence, and the majestic singing vibrated through the entire space of the theatre, shaking the heartstrings of the vast audience.</p>
<p>The pitch and rhythm were quite successful technically, and the most beautiful thing was the set of blue cloth gowns and coarse cloth student uniforms worn by the forty or so energetic young men and women in the group. The neat and simple demeanor showed a generous beauty in the collective. It goes without saying that this kind of true and natural beauty is worth promoting in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The songs that followed were: Blue Sky with a White Sun and Crimson Ground, National Flag Song, July 7th March, Roar, Rise Up to Save the Nation, Defend China, Win Glory for the Country, Go to the Front, National Salvation Song, Charge, and Triumph and other famous songs. The high and low harmony of "Defend China," accompanied by the melodious music, was especially moving to people's hearts.</p>
<p>This time, everyone appreciated the beauty of the songs not only by listening with their ears, but also by staring at the lyrics in the program, which stirred up waves of emotion in their hearts.</p>
<p>After the songs came the drama. The first act was the school's own "New Wu Xun Promotes Righteous School," which was a very necessary educational drama in terms of its meaning. However, it lacked "artistic interest" in the interlacing of the story, so it felt too rigid. The audience who were not accustomed to Mandarin felt it was even more dull.</p>
<p>The first act was "The Eight Hundred Heroes of Zhabei," performed very tensely and vividly. Cantonese easily attracted the attention of the whole audience. The performance of the plot was a great and heroic fact of the war of resistance, which could encourage overseas Chinese to participate in the war of resistance more enthusiastically. The section in which a British friend represented the International Merchant Volunteers to comfort our army was especially suitable for promoting in Hong Kong and Kowloon to promote Sino-British friendship.</p>
<p>"Chinese soldiers are not afraid of death!" "Returning our rivers and mountains is the responsibility of every Chinese person," "..." Many cautionary and heroic words aroused bursts of warm applause. When the bright and glorious national flag was raised, everyone stood up to salute! Sensitive audience members could not help but shed tears.</p>
<p>The third act was "Families Scattered and People Dead." The plot had a strong sense of the war of resistance, and the interest was not low-level, making it the most successful and popular act of this entertainment. The girl Zhan Liheng performed very genuinely and lively, and the audience had a high degree of goodwill towards her.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone stood at attention and sang the national anthem. This brand new entertainment event ended at 1:30.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Fang Yu yan, who spoke to the reporter: there were over one thousand eight hundred guests, and it is estimated that over eight hundred Hong Kong dollars can be raised. After deducting sixty dollars for the theatre rental and over two hundred dollars for other entertainment taxes and various expenses, the library fund can actually obtain a net profit of five to six hundred dollars. This is the beginning of the work, and we will have to find ways to expand it in the future. The reporter, in deep respect, silently wishes for the early establishment of this library, so that the public can obtain some spiritual nourishment.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Stirring Up a Mania for Dramatic Arts in Macau; Hong Kong Era Drama Troupe Gives Charity Performances in Macau <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>Macau, the beautiful name like the Monte Carlo of the East, is completely filled with the atmosphere of a struggle for destiny. All the wills of the people are immersed in tension, entertainment, and constant struggle!</p>
<p>Many people with the hearts of explorers, holding the emotions of seeking stimulation, desperately revolve in this sleepless Macau. They hope to bet their fate in fan-tan, mahjong, roulette, lotteries, and licentiousness. However, the arrangement of fate leads countless people to failure, tragically never to recover—</p>
<p>Similarly, Macau's culture is also tragic and unable to be liberated. It seems that she is eternally numb, and the great and sacred act of resisting the war cannot push her to crawl forward. Macau has the old feudal colors, the same fate as a colony, and even the shadows of our enemies lingering. Therefore, Macau's culture lives stubbornly and cruelly.</p>
<p>The movement of dramatic arts is naturally no exception and has suffered an unfortunate fate. Although Macau's drama workers work desperately, it is a fact that they have failed to grow this seed well. In the recent past, there were four joint performances to raise relief funds, etc. The results were very good, but unfortunately, due to environmental factors, they have recently become quiet again.</p>
<p>Hoping that external forces would stimulate her, push her, this hope flowed in the hearts of Macau's workers. They hoped that external groups would come to Macau to work.</p>
<p>Finally, the flag of the Era Drama Troupe, the only Cantonese professional group that appeared in Hong Kong with a brand-new posture, began to flutter in Macau on December 9th!</p>
<p>The Era Drama Troupe's arrival in Macau is not only to raise funds for the Hong Kong Student Relief Association's Return to China Service Corps and Macau refugees, as the name suggests, but also importantly bears the mission of promoting Macau's dramatic arts and culture!</p>
<p>For this expedition to Macau, the Era Drama Troupe mobilized twenty-seven or eight members to work. Among them were actors on stage, backstage staff, and carpenters. Everyone participated in the work with excitement and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>On the morning of December 9th, they stepped onto the Hong Kong-Macau steamer and left Hong Kong. Lu Dun, Li Chenfeng, Wu Hui, Wang Keng, Zhang Ying, Ou Ai, Li Yueqing, Gao Weilan, and others were all on the journey.</p>
<p>They arrived at this new land at 11:00 AM. The Nan Yuan Hotel became their headquarters. After settling their luggage, they split up to work: inspecting the theatre where they would be staging, contacting the local dramatic arts circles in Macau, purchasing the necessary equipment, etc.</p>
<p>Every day, the last Hong Kong-Macau ferry carried a large amount of scenery and musical instruments for their performance. They personally mobilized to carry her to the dance jujube. Every actor was working so solemnly and diligently. At that time, it was already two o'clock in the deep night.</p>
<p>The next morning was the 10th. Originally, the Macau cultural circles were scheduled to hold a welcome reception for the Era Drama Troupe in the afternoon, but due to time and work, it was impossible to do so. As a result, it could only be postponed!</p>
<p>On the morning of that day, a magnificent advertisement for the Era Drama Troupe's charity performance was hung at the entrance of the most prestigious Victoria Theatre in Macau. Many were also posted on the streets, attracting everyone. The people of Macau were attracted to pay attention, excited, and looking forward to it.</p>
<p>They were very busy setting up the stage. Everyone was working hard. All the lights and decorations were completed with their own strength and effort. From every point of work, they showed that they were diligently, resolutely and struggling for the sake of expanding the field of the dramatic movement. They are contributing people, therefore, are the strength.</p>
<p>What was performed that evening was Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm." It is said that this drama had been performed four or five times in Macau. However, before it started that evening, a wave of audience members had already poured into the theater like a tide. The performance that evening, except for the third act, which did not achieve good results due to Macau's lack of material resources, won boundless applause.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 11th, "Thunderstorm" was still performed. The performance was even better than the previous night. What was performed on the evening was You Jing's famous work "Night-Shining Cup". The effect of this drama was very good. The Era Drama Troupe's performance was extremely outstanding, tense, and moving. Every act won thunderous applause. This is a play about the war of resistance, so there are many exciting parts. However, it was reported that there were people from the Japanese spy agency at the venue on the night (Japanese naval commander Shiozawa Minoru visited the Macau Governor), forcing the temporary deletion of many lines. But the enthusiastic applause still majestically vibrated in the theater, shaking the hearts of the audience, and even more shocking the ambitions of the idiots!</p>
<p>Following on the 12th, "Night-Shining Cup" continued to be performed, and then "The Paint is Not Dry" was performed. The above three days were to raise relief funds for the Hong Kong Student Relief Association's Return to China Service Corps and Macau refugees. From the 13th to the 14th, the performances were by the troupe itself, raising funds. On the 13th, it was "The Paint is Not Dry" and on the night it was "Getting Promoted and Making a Fortune" (Demon Cave). On the 14th, it was "Night-Shining Cup" and on the night it was still "Getting Promoted and Making a Fortune."</p>
<p>Macau's dramatic arts scene is silent and desolate. Although there used to be four or five large and small drama troupes, they have completely stopped recently. It was not until recently that Zhang Xuefeng and others organized the "Unnamed Drama Club" to engage in dramatic arts. Undeniably, in this weak Macau drama world, the Era Drama Troupe appeared in a brand-new posture, stimulating this extremely weak phenomenon, giving the Macau drama world a good influence, and giving the people of Macau the best spiritual food.</p>
<p>In the midst of the fires of war spreading throughout the motherland and the fierce fighting of the war of resistance, our drama is not only for art, it should be the best kind of propaganda, it should be the most excellent horn of the times!</p>
<p>I wish the Era Drama Troupe to march forward on this glorious path!</p>

<p>Although the supply of firewood in Hong Kong is not as tight as it was a few days ago, its price has not fallen, so it can still be said that the firewood shortage period has not passed. According to investigations by this reporter, there has been a sudden increase of over a thousand people in Hong Kong who are making a living by selling firewood due to the high price of firewood. Numerous women are running firewood businesses in the sundry shops at the end of Lockhart Road in Wan Chai and in the open space next to the Naval Club. There are hundreds of people selling bundles of firewood on the side of the street in Gage Street and the surrounding area in Central every day. The bundles of firewood they sell are not obtained by stealing, but are purchased from firewood shops or firewood boats at a relatively favorable price, broken into small branches, and then sold. According to one of them, they can earn a profit of three or four dimes per dollar.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Eliminating Unfortunate Incidents; Sports Field Established in Refugee Camp; Improving the Life of Isolated Soldiers; Radio and Library Also Established <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Since last Christmas, accidental incidents have occurred frequently among our isolated soldiers residing in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp. The authorities find this regrettable, so they held a meeting last Friday to study and seek good methods to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. The results of the meeting have not yet been announced, but many believe that the Chinese soldiers' intention to escape is due to the excessively monotonous life in the palace. Therefore, it is believed that the authorities should not only do their utmost to prevent the guarding soldiers from firing, but also take active measures to improve the lives of the Chinese soldiers in the camp and eliminate the occurrence of unfortunate incidents. It has been learned that the Hong Kong Chinese YMCA has obtained permission from the authorities to build a small house in the camp for the isolated soldiers to gather and play. Various sports equipment is gradually being added to the house, including a basketball court and a volleyball court that is under construction. A wireless radio has now been installed in the camp, and the collection of various books and magazines is underway to establish a library for the soldiers to browse in their spare time.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Gushan Mountain, Fuzhou (5) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Yanqing</p>
<p>Not far from here is also the Taiyi Cave, but because there is no formal path to it, few people know about it. The cave is above the Lotus Pavilion and requires climbing through grass and branches. The entrance to the cave is very small, just enough to accommodate a person. Inside, it is winding and deep, and after walking ten or twenty steps, it is as dark as pitch, and you cannot see your fingers. It was a pity that I did not bring a candle, so I had to turn back and exit the cave. In the dim twilight, I hurried back to Yongquan Temple.</p>
<p>The next morning, under the warm sunlight, I stepped out of the gate of Yongquan Temple. On the way down the mountain, we took the opportunity to browse the eighteen caves and eighteen scenes of Gushan Mountain. In fact, several of the eighteen caves are in the northern part of Gushan Mountain, which we had already visited the day before. As for the eighteen scenes, many of them are inside the rocks, so we visited all the places in a short time. Of the caves, except for the several in the north of the mountain, the Lotus Pavilion is the largest, and the Dharma Cave and Lü Xian Rock are quite exquisite. Most of these caves do not have the form of caves. Some are simply a few houses with one or two monks living inside. It is said that these people have worked hard in Yongquan Temple for three years without receiving a single penny of "reward money" [note, i.e., wages], so the abbot of the temple looks at them differently and usually does not impose any restrictions on their lives. Only when they commit a major offense can they be dismissed according to the rules [meaning expelled]. The method of dismissal is for the temple to hang a pair of straw sandals on the door of the monk's room, then the other monk will understand. Among the eighteen scenes, the large rock of "Two Armors Unloading Saddles" is more worth seeing. The surface of the stone is printed with ripples like fish scales, which is very realistic, but I do not know whether it was formed by natural erosion.</p>
<p>When passing by Qianfu Nunnery, a young woman with a lithe figure dropped her work from the distant field and hurried over to welcome us to the nunnery. The door was pushed open, and it was quiet and silent inside. In the middle of the nunnery is a rectangular patio, surrounded by single-story houses. The light is still fine, but because the houses and various furniture have not been painted, everything looks bleak and desolate, reflecting the lonely lives lived by these people who have been forgotten by others. It is said that the nunnery was built with funds donated by a wealthy family in Shaowu County, northern Fujian. Any vegetarian woman who pays a settlement fee of five or six hundred yuan can entrust herself to the nunnery, living and eating there for the rest of her life. We also walked around the nunnery quickly and came out.</p>
<p>The sun was still shining gently. We followed the slope of the mountain, walking down the wide stone steps step by step. The scenic beauty of Gushan Mountain also gradually left us step by step. Before long, our feet stepped on the flat Fuma Highway. Looking back at Yongquan Temple, it had disappeared into the pine forests on the mountain. Only the towering peak that pierces into the clouds still stands majestically there, seeming to bid us farewell for the last moment. The ruthless long-distance bus carried us back to Fuzhou City. From then on, the scenic spots of Gushan Mountain can only be tasted in our longing and memories.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Huangpu River Long and Short Ferries: Entirely Controlled by the Japanese, Foreign and Private Ferries All Eliminated, Ticket Prices Increased Significantly, Profits Abundant <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Since the war shifted west, while some foreign ferry companies organized temporary services on the Huangpu River to transport goods, the Japanese-owned Shanghai Ferry Company, backed by its powerful support, gradually eliminated other companies. As of recently, the long-distance ferry routes on the Huangpu River, from Gaoqiao in the north to Zhoujiadu in the south, are entirely managed by the company. The operating routes are even more extensive than those previously run by the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company. Although the puppet "Municipal Government" has a pseudo "Public Works Bureau," it has no authority to advise. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Merchant-Run and Municipal-Run Ferry Business Along the Banks</p>
<p>Before the end of the Qing dynasty, east-west traffic on the Huangpu River was served by only eight long-distance ferries: Zhoujiadu, Nanmatou, Dongjiadu, Laobaitu, Yangjiadu, Lan Nibo Chunjiangmatou, and Funshanmatu. All were short-distance river crossings, of a commercial nature. After the establishment of the Republic of China, ferry services were expanded to Jiajiajiao, Xidu, Gaomiao, Donggou, Gaoqiao, and Wusong. These were also commercial ventures. Only after the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in 1927 did the city begin to operate well-equipped and safe long and short-distance municipal ferries. The long-distance ferries included five lines: Wusong, Gaoqiao, Donggou, Gaomiao, and Xidu, all starting from the Beijing Road wharf. The short-distance ferries included five lines: Gaomiao, Qichangzhan, Chunjiangmatou, Dongchang Road, and Dongjiadu. Improved private ferries also operated on three lines: Yangjiadu, Nanmatou, and Zhoujiadu. Therefore, traffic was convenient in all directions, and public travel was exceptionally safe.</p>
<p>Newly Emerging Services Eliminated After the War</p>
<p>After the August 13th Shanghai battle, the Japanese forces first blockaded all ferry crossings and seized ten municipal ferry boats (two had already been sunk by the Chinese). Consequently, at that time, apart from the Dongchang Road, Huajiaxuan, and Nanmatou private ferries that were able to resume operations, only a few newly established foreign ferry companies obtained temporary operating licenses to run long-distance ferry lines to Gaoqiao, Donggou, Gaomiao, and the southern Huangpu areas of Dongjiadu, Nanmatou, Bailianjing, and the Nanshi Dama Wharf. The companies engaged in this business included Dale, Mahler, Fuli, Huitong, Jiangzhe, and Shanghai, among others. The Shanghai company was operated by the Japanese Nissin Company. Competition was fierce. Soon, the Nanshi Dama Wharf line was blocked by the Japanese military, and subsequently, the southern Huangpu lines of Dongjiadu, Nanmatou, and Bailianjing were ordered to cease operations. The northern Huangpu lines of Gaoqiao, Donggou, and Gaomiao were operated exclusively by the Shanghai Company, leveraging the backing of the Japanese forces. Other companies were gradually eliminated and forced to close.</p>
<p>Shanghai Company Exclusively Controls Long-Distance Ferries</p>
<p>After the suspension of the southern Huangpu long-distance ferry lines, transportation to and from the south became quite inconvenient. Therefore, the Japanese Nanhui Pacification Unit established two long-distance ferry lines, Zhoujiadu and Nanmatou, directly to the Jiujiang Road wharf on the Bund in the Public Concession. Two ferry boats, the First and Second Nanhui Maru, were dispatched to shuttle back and forth, charging 30 cents per trip, and the business was quite prosperous. The Shanghai Ferry Company had long coveted these two long-distance ferry lines and lobbied the Japanese Special Service Department for a long time. Until recently, they obtained an operating license, allowing the Shanghai Company to extend its routes to Nanmatou and Zhoujiadu. The long-distance ferry lines to the Public Concession were changed to the Beijing Road wharf (the starting point of the Gaoqiao, Donggou, and Gaomiao lines). Operations officially began a few days ago. The Nanmatou and Zhoujiadu long-distance ferry lines operated by the Nanhui puppet unit were simultaneously discontinued. Consequently, the long-distance ferry routes on both the northern and southern Huangpu River are exclusively controlled by the Japanese Shanghai Company.</p>
<p>High Fares, Huge Monthly Profits</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Company obtained this exclusive operating right, considering the fares set for each line, except for the Nanmatou and Zhoujiadu lines, where the former municipal ferry did not operate, so there was no precedent to follow, the fares for the three northern Huangpu lines, such as Gaoqiao, were exceptionally high. The Gaoqiao line charged $1.20 for first class, 80 cents for second class, and 40 cents for third class. The Donggou line charged 90 cents for first class, 60 cents for second class, and 30 cents for third class. The Gaomiao line charged 60 cents for first class, 40 cents for second class, and 20 cents for third class. Compared to the former municipal ferry, the fares are more than doubled. The ferry boats used are all ten former municipal ferry boats that were seized, repainted, and renamed. Five boats, Donggou, Xidu, Dongchang, Dinghai, and Weisai, are used for the southern Huangpu lines, and five boats, Wusong, Gaoqiao, Jiangsu, Songjiang, and Chunjiang, are used for the northern Huangpu lines, rotating on duty. The total daily expenditure is 600 yuan, while the total daily ticket sales for all lines are approximately 1200 yuan, which covers both costs and profits. Therefore, the monthly profit is estimated to be around 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Puppet Regime Covets Profits, Dream Unrealized</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai puppet "Supervisory Office" was changed to the puppet "Municipal Government" and the original puppet "Transportation Bureau" was changed to the puppet "Public Works Bureau," the puppet "Mayor" Bo Xiaoan coveted this large income. He made informal requests to the Japanese to reclaim the business and operate it as a "municipal enterprise." However, this request was not fulfilled. It is said that Xiaoan was still unwilling to give up. Recently, he submitted a plan to his superiors in the puppet "Renovation Government," so the puppet "Premier" Liang Hongzhi again proposed the idea of taking over the business to the Japanese side. The Japanese side refused, citing the high profits from each route, shattering the puppet regime's dream.</p>
<p>Existing Private Ferries Mostly Blocked</p>
<p>As for the original private ferries on the Huangpu River, the Japanese, citing military reasons, have not allowed the reopening of any lines except for the three across the river at Dongchang Road, Dongjiadu, and Nanmatou due to the blockade of ferry crossings. Therefore, the Zhoujiadu, Laobaitu, Yangjiadu, Chunjiangmatou, Funshanmatou, Qichangzhan, Jiajiajiao, Xidu, Gaomiao, Donggou, and Gaoqiao cross-river ferry lines have been unable to resume operations to this day. Thousands of ferrymen who depended on this for their livelihood have been unemployed for over a year, and their lives are barely sustained in hardship. The tragic situation is beyond what outsiders can imagine.</p>

<p>The Ming Sang of the Xiaodian Steamship Company, originally the Haili, a disguised vessel of the Japanese China Merchants Bureau, has been undergoing repairs at the Kowloon Dockyard since being purchased by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. It is now reported that the ship is nearing completion and will set sail for Shantou, Shanghai, Yantai, Tianjin, and other places at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Albre Sarraut, formerly a French postal ship managed by the local agency, used to travel to Hong Kong, Saigon, and Haiphong. However, it has been rerouted to other lines for several years and has not been seen locally. According to news yesterday, the ship recently ran aground in the Philippines at Hanmei (transliteration). A distress signal was sent to Little Luzon and the surrounding area. The telegram stated that the ship was hit by violent storms during the voyage and could not be controlled, leading to the accident. The extent of the loss is yet to be reported.</p>

<h3 id="e55">After the Fall of Guangzhou: What I Saw on the Guangdong-Guangxi Road (1) – Refugees Overcrowded, Many Dead and Injured, All Counties and Towns Bombed <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Wuzhou Correspondence: When Guangzhou fell, I escaped danger from the crowd of refugees by crossing the river and walking west. I passed through Shunde, Panyu, Nanhai, Sanshui, Gaoming, and Gaoyao, and then went west along the river into Guangxi. Along the way, I was delayed due to transportation difficulties, or stayed temporarily in various markets and villages, inquiring about the situation. Therefore, it took me more than twenty days to reach Guangxi. Now, I will describe what I saw and heard along the way.</p>
<p>Guangzhou unfortunately fell on January 21st, under the defense of Yu Hanmou, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army. That night, when Guangzhou's life was in peril, I decided to leave the city, crossed the river from Huangsha to Fangcun. When I arrived at the Haibudu wharf after crossing Huangsha, I saw city residents, young and old, carrying their belongings, crowding and scrambling to cross the river. Shouting and crying mingled together. The stores were also moving their goods out of the city, either to the dams around the villages, across Fangcun, or to the riverbanks. Cars, trucks, and rickshaws filled the roads, leaving pedestrians with almost no room to move. In the midst of the shouting and pushing, an air raid alarm suddenly sounded, and all the lights in the city went out. The refugees were even more panicked and embarrassed. The bodies of the old, weak, men, women, and children who fell into the water or were suffocated to death were found along the seaside wharfs. I hired a small sampan for five silver dollars and crossed from Huangsha to Fangcun. By the time I landed, it was already past 9 p.m. Looking at the Huangsha station on the north bank, there were shadowy figures everywhere. Suddenly, the sound of machine guns burst out near the station, as dense as firecrackers during the New Year, lasting for about twenty minutes. At that time, several locomotives were firing up in the station, waiting for orders. Troops and military supplies and heavy weapons were piled up like mountains before and after the station, waiting to be loaded and retreat north along the Guangdong-Han Railway. That night, Guangzhou's order had fallen into chaos.</p>
<p>South of the river, there were two roads that refugees had to take to evacuate (there were no boats that day, only land routes). One was to go along the Guangdong-Sanshui Railway to Sanshui, and the other was to go from Fangcun via Zhaocun and Pingzhou to Chancun. Therefore, if the refugees could cross the river, they could take either route. After arriving at Fangcun, I heard that the road to Shiwitang was extremely crowded because most refugees thought that there were trains to transport them from Shiwitang, and even if the trains were too crowded, they could walk along the railway. Therefore, there were especially many refugees on this road. The trains ran all night, once every two hours, but could not carry everyone. There were too many walkers along the railway to count. I decided that the vehicles on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway were often attacked by planes, which would inevitably cause congestion, danger, and difficulties for us civilians to board. So I changed my direction and went west on another road, leaving Fangcun on foot early on the 21st, taking the route to Zhaocun, Pingzhou, and directly to Chancun. Unexpectedly, there were also tens of thousands of refugees on this road, all aiming to reach Chancun as a temporary destination. It was about fifty miles from Fangcun to Chancun (belonging to Shunde). Along the way, the villages had self-defense forces on guard and guiding the way. There were no extra demands on the various ferries across the water, and the order was good. Halfway there, I heard loud explosions from Guangzhou. At 12 noon, three Japanese planes came and dropped several bombs on the Bijiang Haikou in Chancun New Market, destroying the Huian tile kiln. They also dropped several bombs on the Lintou Station (connecting to the Daliang Highway), killing or injuring five or six people. It is said that this was the first time Japanese planes bombed Chancun. The people in the market were very frightened. The distance between Guangzhou and Chancun is forty or fifty miles, but it only takes two hours by boat. Since Guangzhou had fallen, Chancun could not be considered safe. At that time, there were two refugee camps in the market, but because there were too many people, they could not accommodate them. The vacant ancestral halls in the market and the streets and alleys were filled with refugees, eating in the open and sleeping in the streets, in a very miserable state. After nightfall, the sound of artillery and bombs from Guangzhou could be heard all night. On the morning of the 22nd, about one hundred policemen from the Guangzhou Police Department and hundreds of military and political officials fled to Chancun, or moved to Daliang. It is said that on the morning of the 21st, there were no soldiers or police to maintain order in the city, and the entire city was in chaos. Traitors and local ruffians took the opportunity to steal and set fires. Until the night of the 22nd, the fire had not stopped. Looking north from Zhencun, the sky was red. That day, the police station in the market ordered all the ships along the river to sail to Sanshui Estuary to prevent the Japanese from using them. The population of the market was also ordered to evacuate. The entire market's commerce was at a standstill.</p>
<p>Early on the 23rd, I left Chancun and headed west, intending to stay overnight at Guanshan Market in Xiqiao. Guanshan is about sixty miles from Chancun. Along the way, I passed through Lecun in Shunde and Jili in Nanhai before reaching Guanshan. In the middle, I passed Lecun. The highway bridge next to the market (the Tingfu Highway) had been blown up the day before (the 22nd). According to a local official, all eleven iron bridges on the Jiang-Fo Highway were ordered to be blown up on the 22nd. The vehicles on the road that had not been transferred were also completely disassembled, removing the wheels and important parts, and parked in various villages. Therefore, traffic on the road was completely shut down. However, the people of Lecun were still calm as usual, and the stores were operating as usual. Because of the increased refugee population, business was even more lively. Most people did not know that Guangzhou had fallen. In the teahouses and restaurants, some people talked about the fall of Guangzhou, but most did not believe it, thinking that the Guangdong army had a very strong fighting power and had been building defenses for more than a year. Even if the Japanese army attacked fiercely, they would be able to resist desperately, and even if they were not strong enough, they would be able to hold on for a month or two. However, the ideal and the reality were the opposite. When I reached Jili, the situation was the same as Lecun. When I arrived at Guanshan, the sun was setting and the sky was getting dark. There were about twenty small electric boats and tugboats moored on the Guanshan River, most of which were sealed off by the authorities for dispatch. Most of the staff of the Nanhai County Government and the County Party Headquarters had come to the market, as well as merchants from Guangzhou, Foshan, Chancun, Lanshi, and other places. For a time, the population of Guanshan increased sharply, and business was also abnormally prosperous. Although the market belonged to Nanhai, it was located on the western edge and at the foot of Xiqiao Mountain, so the transportation was not important. Therefore, for more than a year of the war, Japanese planes had not come to harass it. The refugees thought it was a safe place. Unexpectedly, Japanese planes bombed it on the 24th, and the losses were incalculable. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Maintaining China's Trade Position, Encouraging the Export of Local Products, Exempting Transit and Export Taxes, and Providing Full Transportation Convenience <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission made great efforts to adjust the market prices of local products and promote exports, goods that needed to be settled in foreign exchange were exempted from export tax. At this time of war, in order to maintain the overseas trade position of the main local products, every effort was made to manage tung oil, silk, tea, etc., to increase production and sell them abroad. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Incentives for Exports</p>
<p>The Trade Commission provides the following incentives: (1) For export goods that are proven to be sold abroad, the Central Trust Bureau is allowed to record the costs of war risk insurance, and those who analyze the benefits after the sale of the goods are exempt from paying the insurance premium. (2) For export goods that are transited and guaranteed to be sold abroad, the transit tax will be waived in accordance with the tax regulations, and there is no need to go through the procedures of collecting first and then refunding. (3) Expenses for foreign sales that should be settled in foreign exchange are exempt from export tax. (4) The relevant agencies will provide full convenience for the transportation of export goods. (5) When the cost of export goods is lower than the foreign market price, the purchase price of the goods in the place of origin and its distribution market may be determined according to the foreign market price, and the association and merchants will purchase as much as possible. (6) When the cost of export goods is higher than the foreign market price, the purchase price of the goods in the place of origin and its distribution market may be determined according to the production cost of the goods. If the merchants are unwilling to be responsible due to the high price of the goods, the association will purchase as much as possible according to the set price.</p>
<p>Main Local Products</p>
<p>Exports of the main local products last year: (1) Tung oil: 680,567 quintals, valued at 38,222,582 yuan; (2) Silk: 5,178,831 kilograms, valued at 33,877,696 yuan; (3) Tea: 384,024 quintals, valued at 30,354,276 yuan; (4) Bristles: 33,438 quintals, valued at 25,535,175 yuan; (5) Cotton: 1,295,561 quintals, valued at 95,162,235 yuan; (6) Wool: 4,152,363 kilograms, valued at 9,657,984 yuan. The above figures are calculated by converting the statutory prices of the Customs Gold Unit into legal currency. Compared with the previous year, except for the increase in cotton, the rest have decreased, but the number of decreases is not very large.</p>

<p>On the 14th, the South China Football Team played its fourth match since arriving in Vietnam, playing against the local Southern Vietnam B Team at night. The members of South China performed very well, and Southern Vietnam also made good contributions. The fans in the stadium sighed in admiration.</p>
<p>After a fierce competition, South China once again achieved a satisfactory result, defeating the strong enemy with a score of 4-2, ending this night battle. Chen Dehui scored two goals in a row, and Li Zhaorong and Yang Shuiyi each scored one goal.</p>
<p>South China was invited by the Southern Vietnam team to Vietnam. Old friends met again, and they were happy to talk about the past. How happy they must have been!</p>
<p>According to Zhu Zhaohang's letter, the entire South China army received warm hospitality from the host after arriving in Vietnam, and their kindness was touching.</p>
<p>The host learned that Hong Kong football has been doing very well recently, so they consulted with Mo Qing, the coach of the South China army, about the possibility of coming to Hong Kong for competition again during the Lunar New Year period.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, both parties are in discussions. If it happens, the fans on the island will really be in for a treat! (Dong Lang)</p>
<h3 id="e59">The First Battle of South China's Expedition to Vietnam: Chen Dehui's Bravery Commendable, Three Central Defenders Also Give a Good Performance <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Saigon, 8th, Airmail Special Dispatch) The South China Football Team was invited by the Saigon Football Association and traveled to Saigon with a group of nineteen people. We arrived at the port on the morning of the 5th on the "Li Men" ship. The sea journey took three and a half days, during which we encountered wind and waves, and six members of the team suffered from seasickness and could not eat. Fortunately, the Hong Kong athletes attending the Saigon Far East Tennis Tournament were on the same ship, so we did not feel lonely during the journey. The captain of the "Li Men" specially allowed us to practice jumping rope and calisthenics on deck, so we did not reduce our training time during the three and a half day voyage. The ship docked on the morning of the 9th, and the president and staff of the Saigon Football Association, as well as representatives from all walks of life in the Chinese community, gathered at the pier to welcome us. This shows how much the Chinese community admires the Iron Army of South China and expects us to fight against the local strong teams in Saigon to vent their frustrations. When foreign guests arrive in Saigon, they must go through strict customs procedures and have their luggage checked. Fortunately, our team was spared this troublesome procedure. Our team was the first to disembark after the ship docked. The team is staying in a grand Chinese hotel called "Dahua," which is a magnificent building similar to the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. In addition to the usual social events, tea parties, dinner parties, and practices, the players go to bed at 9 pm every night.</p>
<p>First Battle After Arrival</p>
<p>The first battle was held on the afternoon of the 7th against the French Athletes Team, a strong team in Saigon. An Ding, the famous right winger who besieged Hong Kong in the spring, and his inner auxiliaries all attended. The game was extremely tense, and the audience was eager to see the performance of the South China team. The number of spectators was quite crowded. South China was naturally cautious in facing this first tough battle. Before the game, Team Leader Mo encouraged the team members, and we all went to the field to cheer them on. As a result, we relied on the hard work of our warriors and took the lead with a score of seven to four. Chen Dehui scored four goals, Li Zhaorong scored two, and Luo Douwen scored one. In this game, the French League team once took the lead with a score of three to two in the first half. When the whole team attacked, they often increased their speed, which made it difficult for the central defenders of South China to intercept them. An Ding, the executioner, was one of the best performers in the French League team. However, in the second half, the French League team collapsed after a slight setback, and finally surrendered. On the South China team, the central defender line performed the best. Liu Qingcai's headers were like a road, and Dehui and Zhaorong were the most outstanding in the forward line. Shuiyi's performance was not satisfactory. What surprised us most was that in Saigon football, players can be substituted at any time, and they can enter the field at any time without having to notify the referee.</p>
<p>Three to One in the First Half</p>
<p>Only eight minutes after the start, Shentui passed the ball low, and Li Beirong scored the first goal. Five minutes later, the French League forward rushed to shoot, sending the ball to the right of the goal, which only Zhang Rongcai could save. At this time, the two sides tied at one to one. After about twenty minutes, the League launched an attack, and An Ding cut in. Zhongwei arrived in time and picked the ball over Rong's head, making it two to one. At that time, Rongcai abandoned the goal and made a desperate move, but it was not effective. At this time, the French League took the lead, and the Vietnamese fans were inexplicably happy, shouting and cheering, thinking that they could win. Unexpectedly, the South China generals performed exceptionally well, and the central defenders gave a wonderful performance. Chen Dehui rushed out like a tiger, breaking through the enemy's encirclement, making it two to two.</p>
<p>Dehui is Brave and Good at Fighting</p>
<p>Before the end of the half, the German army waved its iron legs and took the lead with three to two. An Ding's siege was really powerful, scoring a goal with a header. In the first half, the score was three to three, and the outcome was undecided. The second half was the world of South China. In terms of coordination, there was pure cooperation. After about ten minutes, Dehui gave another outstanding performance and scored a goal, and South China took the lead again with four to three. Li Zhaorong made it five to three, and Luo Douwen waited for a very good opportunity. Without waiting for the ball to fall, he hit the ball into the net with his left leg, making it six to three. Finally, An Ding of the French League scored a goal in the chaos, and Dehui completed the score of seven to four. The South China lineup is as follows: (Recorded by Zhu Zhaodan)</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Li Guoqi Liu Qingcai Liu Weipei</p>
<p>Luo Douwen Li Zhaorong Chen Dehui Feng Liangxiang Yang Shuiyi</p>

<p>The Da Sheng Cup Volleyball Tournament was held yesterday (the 15th) at 3:30 PM at the Pou Kong Village Road Playground between Pui Ying and South China. Pui Ying has been invincible since its establishment, and South China is also a leader in the team. The two teams met on this day, both with the determination to win. Both sides arranged their best players, and the audience also thought that the two teams were evenly matched and would have a fierce battle, so they flocked to the scene, which was extremely crowded. After the two teams began to compete, their strength was evenly matched and the battle was intense. Qiu Guangxie and Yu Qi'en performed excellently, but South China's middle and rear ranks were quite weak in defense, which allowed Pui Ying's army to attack and break through the front line with lightning speed. South China lost with a score of zero to three, and the championship title of this year will belong to Pui Ying. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>After the referee blew the whistle to start the game, Yu Qi'en of South China used both spikes and blocks, and gained some success. Hu Yaodong also occasionally fired, and Pui Ying was forced back. Qiu Guangxie opened fire from both sides, and every shot hit the mark. Yu Qi'en, Hu Yaodong, Li Baotian, and others resisted desperately and tried their best to defend. The score was 21 to 21, and the battle situation was spectacular and exciting. South China finally lost because of occasional gaps in the middle defense, which allowed Qiu Guangxie to take advantage of the situation. They won the first game 26 to 24. South China was determined to recover the lost ground. Li Zhenzhong joined the battle group, and Wu Shuangbai and Hu Yaodong were also very active. However, Chen Jiao of Pui Ying did not move, and Li Lianze and Qiu Guangxie frequently launched spikes, which made it impossible for South China's front row to resist. At the end of this game, South China lost again with a score of 18 to 21. However, South China suffered one loss after another, and the morale of the army was not stable. After the start of the third game, Yu Qi'en, Hu Yaodong, and others frequently waved their hands, and the situation seemed to improve. However, Pui Ying saw that victory was in sight and did not want to fail, so they worked hard and won again with a score of 21 to 18. The two lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Pui Ying</p>

<p>— Wang Xuecheng</p>
<p>Everyone has a love for beauty, but everyone's aesthetic concept is different. What most people consider to be a fit body does not necessarily contain the ingredients of "health". However, a healthy body must contain the "beauty" of "fitness". If we want true "fitness and beauty", we only need to aim at "fitness" and move towards it.</p>
<p>True fitness and beauty can only be achieved through sports methods. The scope of sports is very wide, but the most important of these is exercise. Among the various sports, the most effective are calisthenics and equipment exercises.</p>
<p>If you want to obtain true "fitness and beauty" in a short period of time, you must pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Get plenty of rest, sleep, and nutrition.</p>
<p>(2) Exercise for at least fifteen minutes every day.</p>
<p>(3) Bathe at least twice a week. It would be better if you can bathe once a day.</p>
<p>(4) Drink plenty of clean water to keep the intestines clean.</p>
<p>(5) Do more deep breathing, walking, and sunbathing.</p>
<p>(6) Always maintain the correct body posture.</p>
<p>(7) Mental hygiene—do not be depressed, avoid anger, be optimistic, be energetic, and think positively.</p>
<p>When engaging in fitness exercises, you must first focus on the exercise of the trunk, especially women should do more of this extreme exercise. But we must not neglect the average development of the body. The various exercises introduced here can not only exercise the trunk, but also have the effect of promoting the average development of the body. However, it is more suitable for people who already have a strong foundation or whose trunks are well exercised, and the effect is also greater.</p>
<p>As for the order of the exercises, we will temporarily adopt the simplest method, without distinguishing the parts to be exercised. There are about five exercises introduced each time. We only need to continue practicing the exercises introduced each time for about three days. Then, we will change to the exercises introduced next time. After two or three months, it is best to change to practicing different exercises every day. When all the exercises have been done, we will return to the old exercises. At this time, we should start paying attention to the parts of the body that are more underdeveloped and formulate more complex exercise programs to try to make the more underdeveloped parts catch up with the more advanced parts.</p>
<p>The exercises introduced this time focus on the back, waist, buttocks, and legs, and can also improve the body's flexibility. They are also very effective for internal exercises.</p>
<p>(1) Stand upright, extend both arms straight above the head, keep both feet together, and do not bend the knees. Then, bend the lower body forward as far as possible until the fingers touch the toes. Exhale when the upper body bends forward and inhale when standing upright. Do this twenty or fifteen times.</p>
<p>In addition to developing the muscles of the back, lower back, and abdomen, this exercise can also stretch the back muscles and the tendons of the back of the thighs, making the body flexible (to be continued).</p>

<p>Entertainment…Social Gangster</p>
<p>The Last Gansster</p>
<p>Edward Robinson plays a gangster. His success in his past works proves that he is a talented person. His superb acting skills and subtle character portrayals have won unanimous praise from every audience.</p>
<p>In this film, he once again plays a gangster who does all kinds of evil, kills and loots, and ignores the laws of the country. He indulges in the evil forces of the entire society, dominates the world, deceives and indulges, and is invincible. But in the end, for the sake of his wife and children, he sacrifices everything, including his own life, and gets an extremely tragic end.</p>
<p>Edward's acting skills in this film are full of sparks of talent and have an extraordinary touching power. James Stewart and Ruth Shattanam co-star. At the same time, in this film, we also see a perfect Hollywood rogue actor list. All the tense and moving plots in this "social gangster's heart" will give the audience a large and strong new stimulus.</p>
<p>Queen's Peace…Fishing Boat Battle Blood</p>
<p>Spawn of tne North</p>
<p>A movie adapted from a famous literary work, depicting the life of the islanders on the Alaska Peninsula in the northern border of the United States and the Arctic Ocean. It is a place where a large number of "salmon" are produced, but the fishermen who make a living by fishing must make great efforts to overcome all natural and man-made difficulties, such as icebergs floating on the sea and the rampant fishing thieves, to maintain their interests. In their lives full of love and hate, there are many touching stories.</p>
<p>This film tells the story of two good friends who, due to conflicts of fishing interests, one cooperates with fishing thieves and the other stands on the side of the fishermen's self-defense group. Good friends become enemies, and behind them are women who deeply love them, who are helpless and watch them fight each other. Later, the one who collaborated with the pirates was finally injured and repented, and deliberately crashed the pirate ship under the iceberg, dying with the fishing thieves, sacrificing himself, and perfecting his friend, as the climax of the film.</p>
<p>The photography technique of this film is lively and clever. There are also several shots of Indian sacrificial ceremonies, which, in our opinion, are full of mysterious meaning. At the same time, this film has five stars, starring Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda, and Dorothy Lamour, and co-starring Akim Tamiroff and John Barrymore. The arrangement of the plot gives everyone the opportunity to give full play to their artistic talents. Director Henry Hathaway has directed films such as "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine" and "The Real Glory". He is very good at handling the plot and the climax of this film and has the power to control the audience's emotions.</p>
<p>Oriental…Weird Bachelor</p>
<p>Professor Beware</p>
<p>After Harold Lloyd starred in "Safety Last!", he gave us a very bad impression due to the insulting China relationship. For a while, no movies came to China. The "Professor Beware" this time is still the same style as before in terms of performance. The plot is fanciful, and there are only a few thrilling places. His silly actions only make people laugh. Naturally, there are also many humorous scenes and dialogues.</p>
<p>Dahua…Tarzan's Revenge</p>
<p>Tarzan's Rvenge</p>
<p>The story is mediocre, telling the story of an explorer who wants to capture white people deep into the Fengyi area. The king colludes with the natives and wants to kidnap "white women". Fortunately, Tarzan tries to help, and later the white woman falls in love with Tarzan and never returns.</p>
<p>The performance is not surprising at all, far inferior to the "Tarzan and His Mate" starring Grant Maris and Eleanor Holm.</p>
<p>Scene Star...Six Female Singers</p>
<p>Wklkfng Down Broadway</p>
<p>Describing six female singers who are like sisters, once they are separated, they all feel reluctant because they have been together for a long time. Finally, they agree to meet again on New Year's Eve next year. However, after being scattered, different fates lead to different encounters, joys and sorrows, which are handled very completely.</p>
<p>Central…Love Tears and Blood Mandarin Film</p>
<p>It is adapted from Xu Qin's original work and directed by Bu Wancang. It can be said to be easy to get married. The protagonist is still played by Jin Yan, but the female protagonist and the rest of the supporting roles have been replaced by Ai Mei Yun and Mei Xi.</p>
<p>The story is simple to say, it is about a woman in a feudal society who repeatedly tried to struggle and finally ended her life with self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it can be said to be a work of medium meaning. It is the "Poor Mother" opera, because it is too long, it destroys the emotions of the whole play. The performances of Hui Yan, Yuan Meixun, and Hai Xi are all good.</p>
<p>New World…Spring Love Fire Cantonese Film</p>
<p>The film tells about the inside story of a big hotel, the strange social dynamics, and the deformed development of society. After watching it, there is a great feeling. This film is the first production of Justice Public, starring Star Duan Shanxiao and Chen Yunshang.</p>

<p>— Ling Song</p>
<p>The cold night in the country, relying on the regulation of the foreign wind, is not considered cold, but it is always colder than usual.</p>
<p>It was late at night, and the later it got, the colder it got. I, who was scratching with a pen under the light, seemed a little overwhelmed.</p>
<p>"Useless thing," I scolded myself, "You can't hold on in such weather?"</p>
<p>Put down the pen. I walked back and forth in the house with my hands in my sleeves. I thought of the soldiers on the front line in the cold night. In the situation of "a frozen beard, a hesitant warhorse", the soldiers had to fight not only against demons, but also against nature. From supplies to clothing, from daily life to working hours, they were suffering all the time, working hard day and night. In this cold and gloomy night, maybe there was a joyful victory for the soldiers, maybe fresh red blood would flow on the white snow, a mixture of red and white. For the freedom of the country and the liberation of the nation, they are struggling hard in the cold night.</p>
<p>-Useless thing-I scolded myself again in my heart. Thinking of the hardships of the soldiers on the front line, I really dared not be lazy, and the pen continued to scratch under the dim light.</p>
<p>A gust of cold wind sent a burst of hoarse Huqin sound. Intermittently mixed with some girls' singing. No, it was sobbing. I imagined that the cold wind was mercilessly attacking her. Her thin clothes could not bear the tyranny of the wind god, and her body trembled a little. Even her singing voice trembled.</p>
<p>"The iron hooves of the X people have covered my hometown, but the whip of life has driven her to the streets. Poor, this cold night street!" I thought in my heart bewilderedly.</p>
<p>My mind was filled with compatriots sleeping under the building, children who had lost their parents in the wilderness, those stragglers in the ends of the earth, those homesick people who could not get news from their fallen hometowns, and those faces that were scorched yellow due to insufficient nutrition, thin limbs, spines bent by the burden of life, and the sobbing sounds trembling in the cold wind...</p>
<p>Who gave us this pain?</p>
<p>I opened the window and saw two long, thin shadows moving under the road. Staggering, they were playing the intermittent singing and the hoarse Huqin sound.</p>
<p>From the neighborhood came a burst of jazz music. The rapid, bouncing, heart-wrenching melody could be imagined as the mood and life of some people. There are not a few of these people on the island. The jazz music has covered up the sounds of cannons and bombs that they have experienced, and they no longer remember them. The smiling faces and red makeup of women cover up the fresh red blood stained on the land of the motherland. Green jade-like wine glasses are filled with red wine. Strong lights and intoxicating aromas are exchanged. The gunpowder smell surrounding the island is dispelled.</p>
<p>Drink, drink, forget the hometown, forget the motherland. They don't seem to be descendants of the Yellow Emperor.</p>
<p>The coldness cannot get rid of "on the one hand, serious work, on the other hand, licentiousness and shamelessness." In the trenches, there are people's liberation soldiers who endure hardships and fight desperately; on this prosperous island, there are also people who enjoy themselves, are selfish and self-interested. There are also batches of compatriots who are suffering the pain of the great era and wandering in the cold night streets.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Cherishing Talent <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yiping</p>
<p>In this day and age, finding a means of survival is truly difficult. Not having an education is unacceptable, but even with one, it doesn't guarantee success. The ×× Refugee Industrial Cooperative, established to not necessarily serve the nation, announced the recruitment of fifty female members, attracting over one hundred and fifty applicants. The examination was divided into three parts: oral test, written test, and technical test. The written test question was "The relationship between the victory of the War of Resistance and refugee production." It is said that many applicants had received higher education and possessed university diplomas. However, the committee members, believing that their "skills should not be limited to small crafts," did not accept them. As the newspaper aptly stated, "Do not apply as a refugee if you cannot write. If you can write, you are not allowed to be a refugee."</p>
<p>The committee members' painstaking efforts to cherish talent are truly commendable. University graduates are capable of doing many things. Why should they be asked to do small crafts, thus limiting their future? To use great talent for small tasks is to underestimate our university education, which is, of course, unacceptable. However, this further proves the uselessness of our university education. Because these university graduates probably ran into walls everywhere with their diplomas before coming to the ×× Industrial Cooperative. But now, they don't even have the qualifications to do small crafts. Who would have expected that?</p>
<p>Cherishing talent does not mean preventing someone from doing small things, but rather promoting them to do great things. To truly cherish talent, one must educate them well, so that they not only excel in their studies but are also useful and can be employed.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Cold <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Lie Ke</p>
<p>Although the season has turned to winter, the feeling of cold is still so faint. In the south, cold seems to be shut out of doors. That biting north wind, that hard ice, those snowflakes as large as white butterflies… those cheerleaders of the cold night, those crystallized products of the cold, needless to say, have vanished without a trace. Even the thinnest layer of frost has no chance of descending—cold and the South can be said to be completely isolated!</p>
<p>Recently, I have not been threatened by the cold. I have not even worn the clothes one should wear in the cold, and I have not felt even a little bit of cold. This almost makes me disbelieve that it is winter. I look at the newly placed calendar on my desk, and at the thermometer on the wall. Past experience tells me, "The season and the climate are too unharmonious!"</p>
<p>People who have grown up in the North since childhood do not find the cold as terrible as Southerners imagine—they do have a special tolerance for the cold. They also have a unique appreciation and preference for the scenery of the cold season. That white earth covered with snow, that silver-white snow and the piercing light it reflects, that completely frozen ditches, that grove of trees filled with light through their branches, that old crow searching for food in the cold, emitting a sad cry, that… every scene, every object is forever dreamed of by the people of the North!…</p>
<p>Now, I am unfortunately living in the South. What I can see every day is a vast sea and Victoria Peak, as dull as a clumsy ox. The tones are always so simple, the trees are also so green, stagnant, and lonely. I can't see even a bit of change, and I can't tell the difference between the summer and winter scenery... I know that this is because of the lack of cold. Therefore, I further understand the greatness of cold, and the amazing transformative and changing power of cold! I do not agree with the saying that "cold is cruel, it will wither plants." On the contrary, I think that 'withering plants' cannot be considered cruel, but is precisely its greatness. Think, if it were not like this, how would trees develop strong and solid branches? They might be as lax as those grown in the tropics. If it were not like this, how could there be tender buds and willow green in spring? How could there be a lush green in summer? And how could there be yellow leaves and red maple in autumn?...</p>
<p>The trees grown in the realm of cold are extraordinarily hard; the herbs grown in the realm of cold have roots that are particularly strong; and the people grown in the realm of cold are all outstandingly brave! Cold is, after all, the touchstone of all things. It will eliminate the weak and degenerate; it will sing to the unyielding lonely pine! Cold weather is also the night of all things. It will instruct trees, insects, and animals to sleep well and rest well! Preparing for the coming spring, how to develop and grow!</p>
<p>Cold is not terrible! It does not have the frivolousness of summer heat, the indulgence of spring harmony, or the desolation of autumn coolness. Its only characteristic is seriousness. People who love seriousness should welcome it!</p>
<h3 id="e72">Random Notes on the March <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Day of Departure</p>
<p>The troops were moving from the vicinity of the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway towards E'dong, originally intended as the reserve team for the eastern route. The temporary task was to prepare for the defense of the Ba River line. To gain practical defense experience on the banks of the Ba River, a river defense exercise was also planned. Everything was prepared, except for the date of the exercise. Suddenly, orders for departure were received. It was on September 1st that the order came down from the regimental headquarters all the way to the division headquarters. The exercise was called off as the troops were to begin marching on the 1st.</p>
<p>Staying in one place for too long easily causes boredom, especially among soldiers. They seem to all have restless bodies. Walking a certain distance each day and getting some exercise is not something they fear. Asking them to stay in one place for a long time is more unbearable than being in prison. Moreover, since the troops arrived on the Ba River line, due to acclimatization issues and the rampant mosquitoes, seven out of ten soldiers fell ill. The desire to depart had long been brewing among the soldiers. They even expressed it in Henan dialect, sadly and resentfully cursing:</p>
<p>"Damn it, is a man really supposed to die in this unpleasant place? Damn it!" (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Rushing to the Lotus Ancient Temple at Night <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Lun</p>
<p>Two big guys, two small guys, there were four of us in total.</p>
<p>I and Ying, the two small ones, walked in front; Wan Xiangping, the two big ones, followed behind. The emptiness of the night made us feel extremely cold. The plains lying under the night sky seemed as if they had just died. The slender bamboo forests stood straight and stiff. The surface of the pond no longer had rippling wrinkles. It lay flat, like the face of a melancholy middle-aged widow. Only the weeds, washed by the misty dew in a refreshing bath, appeared particularly lively, reflecting the fish-scale-like dewdrops attached to them. However, we trampled them down with every step, so that their bodies returned to their former dirty state.</p>
<p>The slightest sound, even if it is not worth paying attention to, exceptionally attracted our attention, because the surroundings were all dead objects, and only our shadows were moving.</p>
<p>Cowardly and afraid of the dark, people are equally afraid of traveling at night. They anxiously pondered: 'Snakes will crawl out with their curved bodies to bite people's ankles.' With this added reason, greater terror also grew.</p>
<p>"We don't have torches to scare away bears. How can we scare them if they rush out of the forest?"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, we became even more frightened. We cleared our noses and looked at the road we were about to walk that night, and our courage grew a little.</p>
<p>So, we also said a word of encouragement to ourselves:</p>
<p>'There's still a long way to go!'</p>
<p>Quickly, we left the village surrounded by bamboo forests in the dark night, and immediately rushed to another village.</p>
<p>The paddy fields had long been harvested. After grazing, the gradually solidified soil was loosened by the plows dragged by yellow cattle. Between the fields, a narrow path was cut, so narrow that there could be no narrower path, as a passageway for pedestrians.</p>
<p>We were on the path, as if stepping on a single thread, almost rolling out of the gap.</p>
<p>The lush wild forest grown under the devil's hand of the night confused our direction. The villagers seemed to deliberately avoid the dark night. As soon as it got dark, they all hid in their homes, but we, lost, were outside their doors asking them.</p>
<p>An old woman responded and came out to the doorway. She used a lot of effort to repeat the well-known path:</p>
<p>'Go around this bamboo forest, and you can go straight to Lotus Ancient Temple.' Her overly long sleeves tugged at her elbow, drew a circle, and then pointed sharply in a direction.</p>
<p>Thanking her, we stepped onto many small paths in the bamboo forest, approaching an unfamiliar village.</p>
<p>The self-defense team member guarding the village entrance shouted the passing password: "Password!"</p>
<p>"Combat Team Three!"</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Target! Lotus Temple!"</p>
<p>When we approached him, he stepped forward to inspect us.</p>
<p>Passing the post where he was originally standing, a group of young farmers were talking about interesting things in front of a house. When they suddenly noticed us, one of the kind elders came out to inquire about our comings and goings.</p>
<p>We did not expect any of them to stop our progress. On the contrary, we were pleased with the village's careful security and vigilance.</p>
<p>"We Chinese people have started doing things we have never done before."</p>
<p>In fact, there are many more things we should be grateful for after being happy. Relying on the kind guidance of the elders, we were not lost a second time in the vast dark night.</p>
<p>'Where can we get out to the main road and go straight to Lotus Temple?'</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll take you out."</p>
<p>So, this loyal elder became our leader, crossing mountains and wading through water along the way, as agile as a sea eagle.</p>
<p>He was enlightened. He said many things that we no longer needed to explain to him. On the contrary, there was also something that we would remember for a long time, and that was a pure and thoughtful heart for young people.</p>
<p>When he stopped, he pointed to the distance and said. "It's not far from where you want to go."</p>
<p>We shook off our brave spirits again and rushed straight to that ancient-faced temple.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Berlin Women's Fashion <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Qing</p>
<p>You must not forget that Hitler is an artist, a very decent painter. He once personally designed his own bedroom, and this spring, a "New Epang Palace" was completed. Not only that, he also painstakingly prepared the new outfits for German women in 1939. These outfits are said to be very "glorious." This "glory" is as outstanding as tightening your belt to make artillery.</p>
<p>On the streets of Berlin, perhaps in front of a cheese shop, you can see a group of young girls waving their big buttocks and shaking their fat chests. In this "great procession," each one wears bronze, silver, and gold cross-shaped badges on their chests. This is the new teaching for German women in 1939, conceived by the scheming artist Hitler.</p>
<p>The waist of the new outfit is very fat, designed for women with large hips who have had many children. Because their leader wants them to have many children, six, seven, eight, nine... the more the better, the more "glorious." However, this "glory" is unfortunately not well understood even by the women themselves. With an unemployed husband at home and several starving children, why have so many more children? Why is giving birth to many children a "glorious" thing? If there are more children, then the "tails" lined up in front of the bakery and cheese shop will be longer, and it will take longer to wait when buying things. Haven't German butter and food already been taken to feed artillery? Because of the lack of butter, even General Goering has lost a lot of weight. What will the many, many children eat? The German economy is withered and cannot fully supply the people with food, yet it wants to greatly increase the population. The result is only more active external aggression and large-scale war. War is Germany's way out, and it is also the way out for German children—to die—the innocent children who are "striving" to produce today are boxes of cannon fodder yet to be buried. Hitler wishes that women's reproductive cells could divide as quickly and as many as possible, and even more so that children could be blown up as quickly as rubber people. He wants to "manufacture" children like manufacturing armaments, in order to complete the "dream" of "My Struggle."</p>
<p>What crime have children committed? Before they are born, they are destined to die without a complete corpse. Hitler is the criminal of children and the great criminal of women. He sees women as "animals" who can work and reproduce, and prepares to slaughter their husbands and sons (in future wars). Those cross-shaped badges that reward childbirth are not a symbol of "glory," but, on the contrary, are a symbol of sinful shame. For freedom and for peace, we must tear up this sinful, shameful "new outfit."</p>
