<p>社評</p>
<h3>反侵畧陣線能不包括遠東嗎？</h3>
<p>連日各報的評論皆集中於討論反侵略陣線與遠東的問題，一致地主張反侵略陣線應該包括遠東的範圍。這是一種主觀的要求：我國的希望這樣，蘇聯的希望也是這樣，卽美國也有同樣的希望。但是比這個主觀的要求更重要的是客觀的發展。現在還有許多人懷疑反侵略陣線未必能包括遠東。他們的論據是：倘若遠東的侵略國家不加入歐洲的糾紛，而中立於歐洲侵略集團與反侵略集團的陣營之外，誠如日本平沼首相上月三十日的談話，「日本並不屬於民主集團，也非極權國家中之一員」，那末，英法美等國似乎就無須與日本作對了。更具體地說，日本儘可以利用歐洲大戰的時期，專力集中於中國的侵略上，使中國屈服，而暫時不侵犯英美法蘇，同時也不參加德意的行動，那末，英法爲着歐洲作戰的便利，不是可以暫時放任日本嗎？英法的遠東行動旣不積極，美蘇也自保持中立了。有人還拿日本元老及重臣等反對日本參加德意日軍事同盟，以爲日本將必中立的論據。</p>
<p>但是問題之實際的發展不能如是單純而又機械的。我們敢斷言：歐洲反侵畧陣綫的發展，不能不包括遠東的範圍，否則有効的反侵畧陣綫不能形成。我們的論據是：</p>
<p>一，歐洲戰爭爆發時，遠東戰爭必將與之匯合，聯成一片而成爲不可分離的東西。參加歐洲戰爭的國家幾乎全部在遠東有他們交錯的利害關係。他們一方面要保衛歐洲自身的安全，另一方面也要保全遠東權益的完整，歐洲戰爭的執行始有目的。英法不會放棄他們在東方的屬地，也不會輕易犧牲他們在華的權益，但是歐洲大戰發生時，正是他們的東方屬地，特別是遠東權益危險性最大的時候。他們爲要避去這種危險，勢必在遠東作適當的準備與行動，同時也需要正在實行反侵略遠東的國家，予以帮助及方便，例如英國要保衛香港，需要中國陸軍的合作。於是，反侵畧陣線實際上已經包括了中國。</p>
<p>（二）歐洲的反侵略陣綫中不能沒有蘇聯參加。目下充當反侵略陣綫領導者的英法，首先要能兌現對東歐諸小國安全的保證，要保證東歐諸小國的安全，，必須依賴蘇聯的贊助。蘇聯的關係跨着歐亞兩洲，他不但受歐洲侵畧者的恫嚇，並且受着東方侵畧者的威脅，事實上東方侵略者已經再三向蘇聯嘗試其侵略的手勢了。在這情勢下，參加歐洲反侵略陣綫的蘇聯，勢必要以擴大範圍至遠東爲條件。於是歐洲與遠東戰塲聯成一片。</p>
<p>（三）日本侵略者絕對不肯放過整吞亞洲「驅逐歐洲勢力出於亞洲」的機會，以圓它獨霸亞洲的迷夢，在歐洲發生戰爭的時候，日本不能如一些人的推測與英，法，美，蘇維持互不侵犯的妥協局面，它並且要利用這個千載一遇的機會，北進吞併蘇聯的遠東領土，南進「掃蕩」英美法在太平洋上的勢力，或竟再進而佔領她們的属地。當「九一八事變，爆發當時，日本沒有乘機進佔西比利亞。後來成了日本軍政界懊悔與爭論的問題。他們以爲當時蘇聯的遠東建設尙未成功，容易佔領。第二次机會再來時，相信日本决不會再度放過，因爲到那時候，他們認爲蘇聯忙於西方，無力兼顧東方，這樣一來，卽自侵略方面看，也是必然把遠東推進反侵略陣線的範圍內。</p>
<p>（四）再自日本軍部海陸兩派的爭功奪利來推測日本海軍任歐戰爆發時必定進擾太平洋，英國的香港，法國的安南，不消說，卽新加披，菲律濱，乃至澳洲及印度，也都變成他們侵略的對象。日本海軍現因中國戰塲移入內地而漸處於英雄無用武的局勢，海軍派不甘落後，勢必力爭南進政策之執行。在這太平洋的風雲隨歐洲問題緊張而日益瀰漫的今日，不但日本不能够熟視，置若無睹，卽英美法也不能相信日本不伸出魔手來。日本與英法美互不侵犯的情勢，自然無法形成，英美法在太平洋上與日本侵略者的角鬥自屬難免。歐洲反侵略陣線如何能不延長至遠東來呢？</p>
<p>現據上海電訊，各國已在攷慮邀約中國參加反侵畧陣線的問題了，可見遠東反侵略陣線已在發展着了</p>
<h3>日圓與利刃</h3>
<p>— 伍特公譯</p>
<p>本文係Guentber　Stein氏於昨年底在香港時所言，原題爲The　Yen　andthe　Sword載本年三月份出版之PacificAffairs讀此一文，可見日本的對華戰爭，縱然不因軍事上受有重大打擊而淪于失敗，也必因經濟上的東手無策，而全功盡棄；只要中國能够持久抗戰，必可達到最後勝利的目的。特譯全文如下。</p>
<p>中日戰前之貨幣前哨戰</p>
<p>貨幣已證明是此次中日戰爭中決勝的武器之一。許多密切觀察戰事者對於貨幣的重要性，雖估量太多，但中日雙方却早已明白這個事實，在軍事×對行動實在發作前兩年許，中日貸幣戰爭業已活躍進行了。日人在一九三五年初，卽取攻勢，企圖將華北貨幣和「日圓集團」聯成一氣，他們滿望北方五大省能用這個方法和中央分離，卒由日本不流一滴血，不費一顆彈，完全征服。他們對心不甘服的國家强施這一着，不但憑藉外交和軍事的壓力，還利用北方種種不同的紊亂的政治活動，原來那時中國陳舊的銀幣已是危險狀態，日人深覺在金融市場儘有取直接侵略行動的機會，他們叻取的方式，是從事搜括中國尤其北方數省的白銀，那是中國的法定通貨</p>
<p>因此日本使派員在華北依當時中國銀幣折合外匯的反常廉價收買銀幣和銀條，在當地日當局審，指導之下進行順利，得數甚巨。中政府對於白銀出口，雖曾頒行禁令，終不能堵絕白銀走私運往日本。運到日本的總數，並不載見官方發表的輸入報吿中。但一經連到日本，便可大明大白地轉運赴英，據日本公佈的對外貿易統計，自一九三四年至三六年運往英國的白銀，共計値日金二萬七千五百萬元以上。此項白銀，不用說，都是來自中國的，因爲日本並非產銀之國。白銀運到倫敦以後，更按照美政府購艱政策所維持的世界高率市價售去，獲利甚里，可是獲利一層，却出於巧遇機會。日本這種運動的眞正動機，不在求利，而在刦取華北根深蒂固的貸幣準備金，使她不能保持金融上的地位，然後便不得不投入「日圓集團」的掌握，將來並可用同樣手段逐漸處置整個中國。</p>
<p>這種攻擊，雖使中國大受損失，但未能達到日人的主要目的。因爲中政府臨機應變，突然在一九三五年十一月三日實行幣制改革，這一着固然已覺太遲，但仍不失爲亡羊補牢之圖，於是白銀完全收歸國有，不再作爲法定通貨，不准再流通市上，而用政府銀行所發行的紙幣爲代替物。換一句話說，中國已改用一種「管理的」貨幣，以避免日本的打擊，這是其他各國從前大都實行過的。中國立卽從事搜羅仍留在國內的所有白銀，政府所能收得的，至少還有十萬萬元（華幣）之譜，中國因此便搶前了日本一步。因爲這些白銀，不但在承平時可充新紙幣的硬貨準備金，並且遇到戰爭時，還可作爲一種港能的應急基金，由政府自由處置，供在海外購辦軍火之用。</p>
<p>中國在不宣的貨幣戰爭中所取合於還輯的對抗行動，上述兩端，尤其是後一端，足使日人大爲不安，於是日本對付中英兩國政治態度立轉强硬，她所以仇對英國的原故，因爲據傳中國的對抗行動是由英國策動的。日本初猶深信中國的幣制改革，就純粹經濟方面而論，會在短時期中淪於失敗的。她以爲中國是一個落伍，僅僅半統一，且無法管理的國家，政府的權力和信義，都不够使。現有所行國家管理的貨幣實行成功；再加中國人民數千年來用慣了白銀的，現在叫他們忽然改用紙幣，這種紙幣雖能購買外匯，却不能掉換現金，決不會稍獲人民的信任：中政府的這番改革。雖已挽回貨幣上的難關，但不久便將發生新難關，甚至比前一難關更見厲害，到了那時，「日圓集團」便有種種意想不到的膨脹機會。誰知中國的幣制改革。居然一帆風順，成效卓著，給果便一般經濟的進步，神速出乎中政府的意料，等到這種改革顯然已成一種工具，而由中政府利用，使國家的政治統一，利用海外的信用都迅速增進，日本若干方面的恐慌，便日益擴大。</p>
<p>法幣抗戰之驚人威力</p>
<p>若說日本此次對中國作武裝侵略，全由中國的幣制改革得到這些效果有以致之，那未免言之過甚，但歷史大約自會證明這是日本作戰的一個主要原因，正因爲將中國廣大區域併入「日圓集團」的志願，雖確然不是日本經營一切的唯一目的，然而這種志願在她計謀將來的方案中却常常流露，而比一般人想做的爲六。日本的偉大軍事機構到底在中國作大視模的運動了。貨幣武器目前顯然已居次要，可是並未久擱不用。日本始終不忘她的原有目的，所以在北平新傀儡政權成立之後，最先促令實行的四種計畫，其用意求奠定便「日圓集團」在佔領區，得以擴大的基礎，（一）設立「中國聯合準備銀行，」使牠發行的紙幣倫賴日圓；（二）頒行减低入口稅的新稅則，便利日圓新勢力範圍內的日本貿易的擴張。</p>
<p>中國也大大依觀新細成的貨幣武器的奮鬥價値，起初爲了純粹金融和自衛。原因，將白銀收歸國有，而因此產生的戰爭基金，其數至少等於日本銀行存金的一半，全由政府操在手中，充分利用。中國所以能發揮長期抗戰的驚人能力，這是一個要主因素。但是中國還知道用貨幣武器本身來自衛，而且防衛得很周密，無論何處中國正規軍遇到軍備優越的日軍，不得不撤退時，除留下許多游擊隊，困擾戰勝者的後方以外。還留下一件東西，甚至更令日軍痛心疾首；那便是紙幣，日人滿心希望將佔領地區進入「日圓集團」逼令中國人民和日人合作；開發經濟利源至於極度，且從軍事佔領得到新的實業和財政力量，這一切一切的計劃，都因爲中國的法幣僅僅是一張紙，便成泡影。</p>
<p>中國的貨幣抵制日人在佔領地區作根深蒂固的企圖，竟有如此巨效，這不是僥倖成功的。經過承平時兩年的完善統制，使新法幣得到民間的信用，於是政府便能根據這信用進行積極政策，甚至在日人所管轄的地區也發生效果。這種政策的主要目的，是在保持中國法幣的固有價格，而高過日圓，或日人用刺刀尖在佔據地區強迫行用倚賴日圓的任何新貨幣。這此是說，法幣仍可自由掉換外匯，而持有日圓或附屬日圓的貨幣者都不能享受這種重要便利。中國爲了保守這穩固原則，不得不把在外國售去國有白銀所得外匯準備金首先犧牲了一大部分，卽在此時，法幣依然可以掉換外匯。這些準備金的源源流出，（大都因爲拋空投機之故。）使法幣在耗費極巨的一年半戰爭期內逐漸地域低原値的半數；不過法幣難跌價，她把中國境內「日圓集圑」的貨幣也拉低到同樣的程度。一般人却仍願行使中國法幣，她的信用的堅强，流行的普遍，根本的鞏固，和未貶價以前全然相同。</p>
<p>在一九三八年底，中日貨幣戰爭是現膠着的狀態，中國仗了精明堅定的政策，已能使大見低落的外匯準備金减少流出，在若干月中流出之數，幾等於零。廣州武漢雖都陷落，中國雖未得外方金融上獲援助，中國仍能使他的收入和外匯的義務相平衡，故中國能够繼續維持穩固的法幣，幾無窮期，一面又能推進「日圓集團」的遠大計劃，至少在日本未得籌有效的新攻勢之際，這種情形必無變動，日本呢，一向只能踏着步子，處於守勢，這顯然不是因爲他舊有的野心缺乏任何熱誠意却因爲她遭遇了重大的困難，迄今沒有克服的方法。</p>
<p>日圓的血刃與背景</p>
<p>同時，原來包括日本朝鮮台灣「滿洲國」關東租借地的「日元集團」，已以有名無實的方法展至華北，又以更有名無實的狀態展全華中的日軍佔領地區，至於該集團展至華南，那是爲弱極了日方從來發表這一的舉動實在程序，或實在條件，但將這事分析一下，可知他的兩大目的和他的目前發展狀况，一，便利日本得能由從這些區城入物品、而免有外匯的任務支出；這一着且可使日本以將這些區域內的過剩物產在海外出售，得的外匯，全數供她專用，能於地方上所受的揖害，却置之不顧。日人所以要對這些區域實行的貨幣充分統制，不僅爲了要吿成這兩種目的，並且爲了借此可成一有力的槓杆，推動日本的一般經濟發展，那推動的方法，當然週合日本軍部的願望，和日本自己經濟主需要。</p>
<p>日本必須源源不絕地擴張它輪出的售賣，這是由於日本國內實行兩種彼此抵觸的政策所致。一種是限制而非增高它本國人民的購買力；一種是增高國內製造工業的產量，達到的的技術能力的極度。日本一些貿易的數量，近來的確有歸人的增長。自「滿洲事變」發生的一九三一年起，至中日戰事發生，前年一九三六年止，這九年中增多足足百分之百。對外貿易的發達，其中全少一部分是由於削减售價而使國家作大犧牲才能得到。假使戰爭的準備並未吸收日本工業所增的出產，那末，日本國內購買力和日本工業所製造的貨物數量相距日遠的鎨條，仍不能因輸出售賣的增高而塡沒。軍事上和工業上的戰爭準備，且具借此以謀繼續增高輸出的目的。假使目前對華爭不能如預望得到在曾經擴大「日圓集圑」內覓獲解决的結果，問題在將來更嚴重。就下述的情形觀來，日本藉奪取中國市場以制勝輸出日圓的機會，的確是很薄弱的，甚至想大大解除問題的困難，也不可得的。可是這種不利的氣象，却使日本添了一個圖將中國經濟隸屬「日圓集團」的原因，以便在華遇到無論什麽貿易機會，便可盡力發展到極充分的可能程度。</p>
<p>在此次戰爭以前，日本對華輪出的數量，甚不滿意。一九三六年，卽和乎的最後一年，日本對外國和殖民地的輸出的總數，有四萬萬買主的中國，僅佔其中的百分之四四；這數等於中國向外國所購的總額百分之一六·三·今目觀日本的輸出商已處在於日人鞏固統治之下，既無外幣干涉。而日圓已佔優勢的各地，處境如何不同！每一日本屬地，雖面積和戶口都遠在中國之下，而在一九三六年所購日本的貨物，都超過日本所常常宣布切望和她「合作」而佔世界人口最多的一國。</p>
<p>台灣是日本最老的殖民地，居民不稍過五百萬人，佔日本本部輸出總額百分之六·八·這使是說，台灣所需要的外貨，向「母國」購買百分之八三·三，向日本其他屬地購買百分之九·一，向非日本的各地所購之數，備佔百分之七·六。朝鮮是日本的第二國大殖民地，有二千三百萬人，所瞞的日貨，佔日本本部輸出總額百分之一八·五，這數等於朝鮮輸入總額百分之八五。一，其餘的輸入百分之八·七，來自其他日本屬地，所以朝鮮向外國所購之物，僅佔輸入百分之六·二·「滿洲國」僅短時期處於日本統治之下，還未達到倚賴大哥而「合作」的理想程度，可是已向該方面大有進展。一九三零年卽九一八事變發生的前一年，居民三千萬人所購的日貨，還不足日本本部輸出總額百分之六·四。但至一九三六年，已增至百分之一四·八。一九三〇年日本帝國的貨物佔滿洲向外方所購的總額百分之三九·三，一九三六年已增至百分之七五·一。尙餘的百分之二二·八，由外貨經售商供給其半，其中大半是關東軍在「滿洲國」境內作軍事準備直接或間接所用的物品。一九三六年日本三大屬地所購的日貨，佔日本本部輸出總額百分之四〇·一，這年中國佔百分之四·四，完全在日本政治勢力範圍外的各國却佔百分之五五·五。</p>
<p>就台灣朝鮮「滿洲國」類推而作評斷，「日圓集團」統制各佔領地區和所被壓服的中國部分數年之後，至少在理想上中國將許日本帝國供給本國輸入需要百分之七〇至八〇左右。但是縱到那時，中國所購日貨的總數，就一九三六年戰前的根據估算，恐仍難達到日本輸出的總額百分之二〇。換一句話說，日本仍在作極大努力以求壓服的四萬萬中國人所給日本輸出商的利益，不會超通一九三六年二千七百萬臺灣人和朝鮮人所供獻的總數，壓到那時，日本總輸出的是百分之四〇，仍須在「日面集圑一外的外國市場出售，那便是說，日貨輸出繼續積極擴張的主要因素，整個仍將為各外國多多購賣的志願。但有一層。日本如果能將中國完全幷入「日圓集團」，却可得到一個好機會，而將中國目前比較爲高的經濟目給力逐漸削小，於是日本可使中國幣外倚賴日本噌多供給，正如日本現在懷抱這個目的操縱台灣朝鮮，和機操縱「滿洲國」到了某種程度一般。話雖如此，但這件却是遙遙無期的。</p>
<p>現在日本在華佔領的地方，大部分已用有名無實的方法開始併入「日圓集團」了。日人和佔領地區的留易，現已正式稱爲「日圓集圑貿易，」跟日本和台灣朝鮮「滿洲國」的貿易相同。按照華北日本軍事當局頒行的條例，新設立的「聯準銀行」的紙幣，已在廣大區城作爲法定通貨能十足換，掉日圓；該銀行的金融政策，却全操于日人之手。除「聯準」紙幣外，原有的日圓，和「滿洲國」的紙幣，都被强定了同樣的價値，在華北流行。但是這三種貨幣合併的總數，還遠不及華北中國法幣的總數。中國法幣現仍廣行民間，絕非僅在日軍未到的內地各縣通用，牠在民間仍佔優越的地位，雖有禁令禁止冉用，若不按八折掉換「聯準」紙幣，如查見任何人行使「舊鈔票」都須嚴懲，却絕無效果，華北的新狀况，已使日本的輸出品乘機湧入市塲，據日本正式公布的貿易報吿載稱，一九三八年最前八個月，每月輸出至華北的商品，平均較一九三六年戰前高三倍以上，若連取進關東租借地間接運往華北的輸出品計算，（在戰前大批日貨曾由這條路走私運往，直至最近方才停止，）她的總數，雖華北因遭兵燹，向外國購買的總數已大見减少，然在今日似還比兩年前高出兩倍以上，華中的「日圓集團」的出現，迄今不通仗着日軍爲了應付軍事和商業需要所發行的軍用票的流通，比餃爲多，並且正在逐步擴張的原故，但日本輪出商却也亟亟在那里利用他們的機會，同一時期內，日本運到這些地區的輸出品，每月平均增加數，當然還小，因爲境內的購實力和經濟組織，已全被摧毀，但是華中的總輸入中，日本所佔的數額，已增多四倍左右。新佔領的華南地區，日本「軍用票」已開始行用，豫料也有同據的發展。這些進步，都是剝奪第三國和中國國貸製造的利益而得到的。日本雖在征服的中國戰區內，藉「日圓集圑」的組成，而增大日本的輸出市場，並排斥其餘各國，目前似乎已將第一個目的定上實現的途徑，但目前尙非應付第二目的不可，不然「日元集團」卒將遭遇慘烈的失敗。　（未完）</p>
<h3>赴翁源的途上—漫談同業中的同志—　中國之友在中國（十）</h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>五點鐘的時候，總部的莫副官來了，他是被派來陪我們同去翁源的，這位靑年朋友還帶來一隻鷄，預備當作旅途上的午飯。六點鐘跳上汽車，出韶關馳上赴翁源的公路。車子進大坑口的時候，鋼板出毛病了後身不住地跳躍，震顚得非常利售。司機乃停車查驗，我們亦隨之下車去看看。李蒙夫人對于車子似乎頗為熟練，很迅速地臥下身去，探頭到車底去視察。起來之後，他說：「螺旋脫落了。故鋼板因之鬆散。現在車胎已經發熱。再開下去的話，恐怕要燒掉了車輪。」繼續下去，她還很認眞地說：「我從前在北菲洲旅行的時候，車子也發生過同樣的毛病，而當地許多很好的修理匠對之皆無辦法。我想這個司機，必然也是沒有辦法可以修理的。」在她這樣的結論下，那末，對於到達翁源的希望不免暗淡起來。可是，這位不大多說話的老實司機，却毫不猶豫地換上了工衣，拿起修理的工具，採取了和剛才李蒙夫人一樣的姿態臥在地上。前半身幾乎皆縮到車子底下去了。用力幾下子的動作，便取下了已損壞的一疊鋼片。然後再把它拆開來，一片片地皆加以整理，做得頗有條緒，這種神情吿訴我們，他有偶一定可以把它修好的堅强的目信心。這時候，李蒙夫人已改變了她先前的那種定命的看法。她也覺得這是個頗爲能幹的朋友了，因此她說：「我們去找個地方坐着談談，等候他修好再走吧！」我們跨上旁邊的土坡，在一株大樹的根頭上坐下了，此地四而皆無村莊，行人又少，故祗是靜寂寂的一片。不知怎樣一來，我們竟談論起許多外國記者來了，首先我們談到的是斯諾。我想西行沒記出版後，斯諾已在中國留下了個很深的印象，這些朋友對於中國的情形有很好的了解，他是第一個外國記者跑到陜北，而能很好地認識陜北的。在西行漫記的譯者附記上對于他已有了很詳細的介紹，他生於一九〇五年，美國的米蘇里（Missourf）地方產，少年時曾做過佃工，鐵路上添機噐油的工人，印刷徒，但是後來他也居然畢業於米蘇里大學和哥倫比亞大學，他工作的第一家報紙乃是坎薩斯城（Kanpes　City）的星報（Stat)　。一九二八年的時候，斯諾任上海密勒氏評論報的助理編輯。當時國民政府鐵道部長孫科並且還聘他視察東北，及本部的鐵道。因之他也曾寫過幾本旅行指南。他的足跡幾乎遍於遠東各地，東三省，蒙古，日本，朝鮮，台灣，荷屬，東印度，緬甸，印度，婆羅洲等地，在印度的時候，琮結識了甘地和其他許多革命之士。並且健還在北平燕京大學當過二年敎授努力學習中文，把魯迅的作品介紹到西方去的，他算是第一人，去年他離開中國到非列賓去養病的時候，當地人士要求他作一次公開的演請，好，他答應了，到了開始演講的那一天，會場聽衆不下二千人，情况頗爲熱烈。可是×人却向當地政府提出抗議，以爲斯諾是共產黨而不許他公開演講，那天的結果是不歡而散。演講未成，到會者要不十分憤憤，乃向政府提出要求，並具體說明理由；第一，斯諾並非共產黨，第二，卽使是共產黨，他還是有演講的自由。後來，菲列賓當局亦持此理由拒絕了日本帝國主義橫蠻的要求。斯諾終於在四五千人聽衆較前增加了兩倍多，熱烈的掌聲中，跑上了演講的壇台，在這樣的場面下，他堅決肯定地說：最後勝利必屬中國！的確，斯諾，和他的愛友韋爾斯女士皆爲中國之摯友。繼續下去，我們談到史沬特萊女士，他是英國孟鳩斯特導報駐華的通訊員，在抗戰中曾走過各會場的前綫，並在長沙，廣州等處作過幾度演講，皆博得國人的歡迎，自然她也是個同情中國很熱忱的朋友，講到W.G.希伯（Shipp）他是太平洋評論雜誌，和巴黎的幾家報紙通訊員，大家對於他的印象自然還甚淡然，去年四五月間津浦綫戰事止緊張的時候他由上海到香港，由於胡子嬰先生的介紹，記者與地相識。後來同與赴廣州，他還和我們海關長征團的朋友們同住一起，過着集體生活。在這共同生活中，使我們發覺這位朋友的工作，精神誠然是令人佩服的，晚上遲至半夜後才睡，淸晨四五點卽起，他那打字機的聲音幾乎就替代了我們圑體裏鬧鐘的功能，……正在滔滔不絕地談話的時候，車夫招呼我們；「可以走了！」談話的本意原爲消磨時間，而每個人內心的要求，時刻都還關聯着車子的問題，所以一聽說：可以走了！大家不覺興奮得歡躍起來！連跑連笑，跳下山坡，誰也再來不及結束或追究副才的談話了！李蒙夫人看見車子已被修得出她意料以外地美好，她不覺這還贊嘗不絕，並問車夫可否進過機械專鬥學校。這心理的翁源過程由不信任而看他試試吧。而驚奇佩服。這是一般外國人對中國問題的普通態度，抗戰的情形，自然也還是不能例外，我們該加緊努力，讓他們的心理由，「看他試試吧」！而轉變劫驚奇們服！所「謂自助然後人助」這話深含至理！</p>

<h3>歐洲無戰事</h3>
<p>— 蕭平</p>
<p>接着事情是愈來愈快，而且愈見顯明。</p>
<p>九月里，×××××把蘇台德區送給了希特勒。十一月里莫索里尼伺機崛起，向法要求突尼斯科西嘉，但，他老人家的命運，遠較小弟弟差得遠，要求當然不成。</p>
<p>到了今年，一九三九年三月，莫索里尼還在喋喋不息的時候，希特勒又伸手取去了捷克。張伯倫剛才給希特勒把大夢打醒——其實，也只醒了一半——發出援波宣言準備開始來組織反侵略陣綫，莫索里尼却時來運來，趕緊抓住了阿爾巴尼亞。</p>
<p>這一年的侵略史實，使我們很顯然的看出，德意是永遠用着你攻我守，互爲犄角的方式的。她們從不曾明目張胆的，提出聯合陣線，提出共同要求過。所以，我們說德意的侵略，還只是百分之八十或九十，而不是百分之百。如果用起百分之百的侵略，那便是變管齊下，不給人留點轉圈的餘地。結果，就是戰爭。</p>
<p>名政論家赫登，在他的「多瑙河國家的命運」中，說軸心國家，永遠用着一個政策：「盡一切的力量去避免戰爭，但盡最大的努力，去製造戰爭的空氣，去恫嚇，去叫長戰的國家上當」。</p>
<p>我們同意赫登的話。這一次德，意仍然只是在製造戰爭的空氣，幷無意於眞的戰爭。而且是畏懼眞的戰爭。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>軸心國家，對戰爭的態度，已經明白了，現在，我們且看這一遭，民主國家是怎樣的。</p>
<p>說得冠冕點，英，法，美都是酷愛和平，篤信集體安全制度的國家；自然，嫉戰如仇，决無意去掀起禍患的。</p>
<p>說得老實點，這幾個國家，自一九一八年，在凡爾賽宮中，以戰勝者的姿態，恣意取捨分割，據了個腹飽肚充，使自己走上極端的資本主義，盡情享受。這些年來，苟延維持，還怕不及，那敢再想到一次殘酷毀滅的戰爭。</p>
<p>我們說過，軸心國家畏懼戰爭；現在。我們可不諱議的說，民主國家更畏懼戰爭，戰爭恐怖的毒素，已伸進了民主國家每個人——不論其爲人民，官吏，甚至軍人，或新聞記者。</p>
<p>就因爲此，所以，德意不能在她們的侵略路綫上，佔盡了便宜，最明顯的，我們可以看到。希特勒與莫索里尼，每次有所行動，或提出要求時，英法爲什麼不採取反行動，或提出一些反要求？</p>
<p>當意大利侵阿開始，英相鮑爾温好像挺仗義直言似的——這不過是表面上的說法，其實，仍然是爲了英國自已在地中海的利益——法國趕緊捧出賴伐爾——霍爾計劃去献媚，最後，鮑爾温也視顏地，在下院羣呼「無恥」聲中，自動撇廢了制裁之說。這爲什麽？這是莫索里尼口中的「戰爭」嚇退的。</p>
<p>繼之，希特勒進兵萊茵，顯然是法國的當頭捧喝，當時法國朝野，也的確義憤塡胸，大有凖備一拼的樣子。但不久，氣象全非，反換出極右派佛蘭亭來掌揆，大唱其親德論調，以緩和兩國空氣。這是什麽？這又是希特勒口中的「戰爭」嚇成的。</p>
<p>西班牙的事，更顯明。德，意公然調軍運械，巳經「干涉」得一塌糊塗了，英法偏偏組織什麽「不千涉委員會」，結果，政府軍終於在彈絕援盡之下崩潰了。所以，許多人說，佛朗哥的勝利，不是德，意之力，實在是英，法的「不干涉」之功。爲什麽「不干涉」？怕事也</p>
<p>這以後，更是張伯倫的所謂現實主義的世界。德併奧。當然毋庸說話，只要趕快把奧使館改歸德使館，以表友好之意。</p>
<p>接着是，蘇台德區，捷克……。達拉第永遠唯英國馬首是瞻，張怕倫則永遠是「以不忍則亂大謀」，忍，忍，忍，只要不碰到大英帝國的致命傷。</p>
<p>我們幷不是說，張伯倫，達拉第之流，連德意長戰的事實。都不明白。他們很明白，但，他們也明白他們自己，實在比德意更畏戰。雖非十步與百步之別，但終差一籌。只怕惹火了，那兩個魔王，也會任性的攪一下的。</p>
<p>上面追述過去，都是在證明，民主國家也畏懼戰爭。也許有人要說，過去雖然如此，現在可兩樣了，英國已向波蘭，希臘諸國提出保證，準備訴諸武力。</p>
<p>這，我們却也有不同的看法。我們幷不否認，英，法這次的確是轉換了比較强硬的態度，而且是很好的現象。但，眞說英，法怎樣决心保證小國，，準備訴諸武力，那是不磯的。</p>
<p>譬如說，兩個人打架，一方捲起袖子，口出惡聲，是不會打起來的。等到對方也捲起袖子，報以惡聲，那架便不得不打起來了。所以兩個不敢眞打架的人，胆子大的，永遠佔上風，因爲他一定先捲起袖子，假模假樣的作着打的姿勢，胆子小的，眼看一觸卽發，事不可爲，便只好掩息旗鼓認輸了。</p>
<p>民主國家和軸心國家的關係，就是這樣的。每一次，都是胆子較大的希特勒或莫索里尼先捲起袖子，雖然張伯倫明知道，那全是假模假樣的，但仍然不敢也捲起袖子來敵對，因爲說不定會弄得勢成騎虎，非眞打不可。</p>
<p>吃次虧，學次乖。張伯倫虧吃多了，終於，乖也畢着了：「先下手爲强」。這一次的反侵略宣言，便是他對德，意先捲袖子，×××××××。張伯倫發表援波宣言的前一天，三月三十日，星期四，英外部發言人說：「波外長將於下星期一抵此，唯首相將不待與波外長會晤，擬於明日發表宣言，以防止侵路者，或在週尾有所發動」。</p>
<p>這不說得很明白嗎，張伯倫是明知德意不敢囘手，×××××××××手，××××××，决不是「决心訴諸武力」。</p>
<p>我們並不遮掩，張伯倫這次的確是佔着上風的，希特勒已經捲起了袖子，要去拿但澤，但不曾來得及。爲了怕眞的戰爭，他只好吞下了這口悶氣。</p>
<p>英法的再度宣言，也的確使軸心國家嚇了一下。但，張伯倫眞的勝利了嗎？制止了軸心國家的侵略嗎？差得遠啦！我們說，張伯倫的宣言仍嚇不倒侵略者。因爲他根本沒有「訴諸武力」的决心——軸心國家只不過爲之幌幌罷了。</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>擴大僑胞精神動員動運</h3>
<p>國民精神總動員運動，是提髙民族自尊心自信心以保證抗戰建國成功的運動，是擴大全民族擁護抗戰建國爭取民族解放的運動，這種運動，如果沒有數千萬僑胞的熱烈參加，是不會完善成功的！</p>
<p>海外僑胞目從中央頒佈國民精神總動員實施綱領及國民公約以後，都能踴躍推行，不僅對於祖國，將有重大的效力，而華僑本身，亦可因此而獲得國際人士的更大的同情與尊敬。，我們僑胞能够熱烈推行精神總動員運動，則不僅可以直接動員僑胞力量援助抗戰建國，並且可以粉碎×好在華僑中的陰謀活動，克服志觀失望情緒，掃除和平妥協毒氛，發揚華僑歷年援助祖國革命救國運動的偉大的精神，對祖國，對世界，都是値得特別重視的。</p>
<p>本港學生曾於不久以前舉行宣誓。東區敎聯會及半島酒店華職工，亦已舉行國民公約宣誓，我們於表示欽敬之外，覺得負有領導民衆之責的與論界，尤應急起直追，舉行大規模的包括全部新聞從業員的宣誓，以積極發展擁護××××××××言論行動的思想動員運動。當然我們更希望各機關各團體各學校各工廠各商店以至各界男女，一致急起直追！</p>
<p>擴大僑胞精神動員運動，當然不能祇以舉行國民公約官誓卽爲滿足：但是我們每一個自認爲尙有熱血尙有骨氣尙重人格尚愛祖國的僑胞必須以參加國民公約宣誓爲光熒奮鬥的開始，隨時隨處信守誓約，進而盡心竭力地協助一切××建國的具體工作。</p>
<p>徼悻於砲火之外，荀全於外人地域的廣大僑胞們啊，祖國的領袖和民衆都在呼喊我們！國際人士正在注視我們！</p>
<h3>祝地政學會　第五屆年會</h3>
<p>中國地政學會，於本月廿二日在川東師範舉行第五屆年會。</p>
<p>記得金面抗戰發動時期，該會以中山先生三民主義土地革命精神，對於修正土地法，曾有極大努力。可惜各地關係當局對此未能一致切實做去，對於全民族抗戰建國事業，不能不認爲遺憾</p>
<p>目前抗戰巳經轉入新的階段。我們必須在這階段中增强前綫的戰鬥力，擴大今後的游擊戰，加緊後方新生力量的培植，凡此諸端，都有賴於廣大農民力量的動員，組織與運用。而要切實達到農民總動員，又首須解决目前農民問題的中心癥結，即土地問題。地政學會年會週在此時開會，我們希望對於土地問題，能够遵照三民主義土地革命的基本原則，獲得合理的解决，則在後方固可獲得擴大農民之目動的積極地努力一切援助前綫加緊生產的工作，而在戰區及×人佔領區域，更可因土地問題的合理解决，而有助於國民公約的忠實執行與抗×反漢奸反傀儡運動的堅持和擴大。此上還只以戰時而言，更進一步，則我們果能在目前對於土地問題獲得適當公允的解决，則於理想的三民主義新中國的建設工作，尤可奠定鞏固的基礎。</p>
<p>地政學會適在此時開會，我們敬謹寄以深切的期望，能够以中山先生三民主義的「平均地權」的原則，以蔣委員長廿二日訓詞所示「實行民生主義的土地政策」的原則，對於當前土地問題，求取適當公允的解决，俾全中國廣大農民，得以自動地積極地來參加抗戰建國一切事業，我們更祈望各地與論界與民衆團體，共寄期勉之意，而祝其獲得應有的成功。</p>

<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>血和淚中的漁民</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>昨天舉行的四救濟漁船下水禮觀感</p>
<p>我們夢想不到「天堂」上的舒服；我們亦想像不到「地獄」裏的痛苦。要是窺見這幅血和淚寫成的漁民圖，你一定悲從中來，三嘆世間竟有如此悲慘事！</p>
<p>本港共有漁民七萬人，散布在港島範圍內的十四個區域。著名的三大漁區是香港仔、笞箕灣和長洲。這些地方的水上就是漁民的家庭，漁民的社會，亦是漁民和生活鬥爭的地方。</p>
<p>愚，笨，嫖，睹，鴉片，紅丸，早婚，拍賣肉體與靈魂，就是構成漁民生活的要素，他們文化水準低落得太可憐了，一百人中頂多就是三人能够寫出自己的名字，社會上亦把他們太賤視了，魚民登陸，一定要飽賞人家的糟踢與欺凌，爲設有知識有組織而成爲被剝削的對象，亦足使他們淪於萬劫不復之地。</p>
<p>前年（廿六年）力月六日，繼「九二」大風災之後——漁民損失幾十萬元——×人開始轟擊赤灣，於是漁民是受到更大的慘痛了。九月十三日起，就開始在萬山羣島燒燬我漁船，殺害我漁民。直到現在爲止，漁民死於×人之手者，計有一萬零九百二十人。被燒燬的漁船共六百二十八艘。負傷及財物損失則不計其數，此外還有六十多艘漁船。共有漁民一千六百多人，已經被×人擄去，淪爲×人的羔羊了。他們能替×人增加生產，他們地理熟悉，能帮忙×人殺害我們自家的同胞，據說現在是給×人管理在虎口附近的地方，這是多麼使人痛心疾首！</p>
<p>我們要是不趕緊步步設防，後患是越來越加嚴重。×人利用漁民的無知，懷柔政策更是任所欲爲。舉凡用十担台灣糖換我們一担米，騙買我們的雞子，甚至於滌着漁船就搶刦……都是不一而足。</p>
<p>現在失業無告急待救敎的漁民，已經是所在都是了。</p>
<p>雖然被燒，被殺，被搶的慘狀層出不窮，爲了生活，却又不得不冒險出海捕魚。這，與其埋怨漁民認識不够，無寧埋怨我們的組織太缺乏，救濟的工作還是十分不够！</p>
<p>這個被人家遺忘與疏忽的嚴重問題，直至去年，由救恤大衆爲懷的何香凝先生向僑胞呼籲，蒙菲律賓熱心僑胞慨捐善款國幣二千元，安南熱心僑胞，慨捐港幣四百九十六元，合共伸港幣一千五百七十六元，由何香凝先生送交蔡楚生先生轉漁民協會負貨人謝憤生氏，計劃辦理，救濟漁民的工作。</p>
<p>謝氏接欵之後，就新建四艘中式小漁船，作爲失業漁民謀生工具，惟每船只容四人，目前只能稍爲救濟十六人而已，俟二個月後，再由其他失業漁人使用，這，自然還不是澈底的完善辦法，只是慰情聊勝于無吧了。</p>
<p>昨天正午十二時，就在香港仔的香島戲院舉行四漁船下水禮的儀式。老態龍鍾的老漁婦，袒胸露臂的黝黑漁人，以及着了海軍裝的漁民義學學生，一大羣沒集會經驗的漁民，把整個戲院擁擠起來。</p>
<p>行禮如儀後，主席謝氏報吿，繼有中賑會代表劉海萍演說。中國救亡劇團副團長王瑩女士因參加鴨錄洲婦女團體歡迎會，亦被邀請演講，一位來自前線的女戰士，感動了天眞純僕的漁民衆。</p>
<p>之後，列隊赴田灣舉行漁船剪採下水禮。本來，主持下水禮的是漁民們所愛戴的何香凝先生。何先生因精神違和未克參加，呈請一位老漁婦盧黄氏主持下水禮，亦是略有意思的。她老人家賞在前峯「九二」風災的時候，義俠勇爲救濟了三百多個漁人，是漁村中「德商望重」的典型漁婦。</p>
<p>小漁船命名，「精誠」「團結」「自力」「更生」等號。每隻四枝漿，一枝桅，一把舵，身長八丈，五尺見闊，吃水三尺，由和合船廠承造，原料採用雜木。並加帆及炊熟，捕魚器，釣魚艇等，四船一切共花一千二百元。在歌聲及吹號齊奏起來的時候，剪了綵，四船遂向海中一帆風順。</p>
<p>但是。這四隻小漁船，只是十六個漁民暫舒燃眉之急而巳。更澈底，更廣法，更積極的，救濟的敎育的工作，還等着我們努力去完成。</p>
<h3>內地魚菜　來源不斷　澳輪昨大帮運來　居民不患食無魚</h3>
<p>本港魚菜行消息、江門失陷之初、有若干種魚菜來源減少、但現下又得繼續供應、連日港澳輪均戰來大帮魚菜、昨日港澳輪淥江號、載來八十餘担、其他各輪亦各有數十担、因之淡水魚之市價、亦已平復、惟柴價零賣、每元祇得四十餘五十斤之譜、尙嫌其貴、貧民更引以爲苦、據內行者言、在目前供求狀况下、柴價不應如是之貴也、</p>
<h3>中國新聞學院　昨行開學典禮　董事長許世英親臨致訓　由今晚起正式開始授課</h3>
<p>香港靑年記者學會主辦之中國新聞學院、昨（廿三）日下午二時假座中華中學舉行開學典禮、到有該院董事長許世英先生、來賓杜其章、方與嚴、黄祖芬、及各學校代表、各報館各通訊社記者、該校敎職員、學員等百餘人、濟濟一堂、情况熱烈、行禮如儀、主席郭步陶致詞、大意謂、今天得各位踴躍蒞臨、異常髙興、談起這個新聞學院、使本人追溯起民國初年、北平報界聯合會、爲訓練新聞技術人材擬舉辦一個新聞大學、但後來因事不果、跟着蔡元培先生感到新聞技術人材之迫切需要，因在北京大學設立一個新聞科、這是訓練新聞學術人材的開始、後來又有成舍我先生在北平創設新聞學專修學校、成績大有可觀、抗戰爆發、該校不幸被×人毀滅，現在靑年記者學會又繼承訓練新聞人材之偉大實任、創立本院、希望學員都能努力學習、將來能够站在新聞崗位上，肩負起抗戰建國之神聖任務云、繼該院敎務主任譚思文、報吿該院籌備經過、課程編配、分組學習等幷談及學生畢業後出路問題、旋該院董事長許世英致訓詞略謂、本人一九一〇年到倫敦時、朋友曾對我說、世間上只有三種人最爲珍責、第一是法官、第二是律師、第三就是新聞記者、諸位同學今日已開始踏上最爲世人尊敬的記者生活之階梯、本人對此有兩種希望、第一、就是修身要能够實踐「淸」「愼」「勤」這三個字、朝向下面六個目的前進、一、爲國家爭生存、二、爲民挨謀解放、三、爲「民生」改善而努力、四、保障固有文化、五、伸張國際正義、六、爲人類謀幸福、第二就是磨練自己的技術、世界新聞技術、日進千里、希望各位努力學習、盡量發揮、各人天才、爲新聞界創造奇跡云云、最後該院長副院長金仲華、敎員王紀元、記者學會代表林日貞、來賓杜其章、方與嚴、黄湘芬等、相繼致詞、均懇切動聽、詞畢、始攝影盡歡而散、聞該院定今晚開始上課云云、</p>
<h3>東來貨品　在港竟大暢銷　賤價傾銷銷場駕乎歐美貨上　疋頭一種輸入已較去年大增</h3>
<p>本港爲遠東一大吞吐口岸、各國商業之在此勾心鬥角、競爭市場者、無不竭其全力、以求制勝，惟歐美貴國貨品、一以途程遙遠、運費浩繁、一以物質較佳，成本過重、但東洋產品則完全相反、故歐美貨物、雖能在本港市塲中佔一席地、但終不能與之並駕齋驅、加以東洋貨品向採大量傾銷政策、而本港又爲一無稅口岸、遂造成其賤貨、求賤價之大好機會、茲査本港入口貨物中、去年三月貨物少而價値多、今年三月則貨物多而價反銳减、其最大原因、殆亦由於東洋貨品在港市場突呈活躍之故、査本年三月疋頭入口共計六百八十六萬四千三百四十八元、去年同月則爲八百八十七萬二千四百九十元、兩相比對、入口貨量較去年爲多、其價値則較去年爲少也、其表如后、</p>

<p>島上風光</p>
<h3>香港仔風景綫</h3>
<p>— 蔡慧生</p>
<p>香港仔——一個處在歌賦山峯的背後，東博寮海峽的支流鴨巴甸港灣中的小市場。它的週遭矗立着許多蒼鬱連綿的山脈；而在隔一衣帶水中，那遙遙相望的鴨脷洲，同樣也是一個小市塲然而，由於峯情的峭拔，平地的偪仄，市場旣無從擴展，而和香港間的交通又較爲不方便，所以當然是比不上香港仔的那樣「繁榮」。這裏，是本港三大漁區之一，港灣中有經常來停泊的，萍踪靡定的大小幾十種漁船。每當舊曆的歲尾年頭，或是節日和什麽「神誕」所有的漁船便不約而向地相率從海上歸來，一行行整齊排列着。舳艦相望，綿亘不絕，頓使這山海成無限的壯觀，從山峯上俯視「海市」中的小艇穿梭來往，再從山峽中看到海上浮沉的風帆，飛翔的沙鳥，假如這不是一個「强梁」的世界，那應該是儘足會做詩的人們去「陶醉」的。</p>
<p>自從「七七」的民族自由解放戰爭展開之後，×人的血手伸進了南海，在香港以及華南沿海岸一帶的漁船，就不斷被×艦所砲擊和焚燒×殺，××××——這種現象，一直繼到現在還是有加靡巳。因此許多漁船都不敢出海，大部長期蟄伏在港灣中，渡其凄凉悲慘的歲月；然而，他們是和每一個人一樣不能不生活的，而且所欠高利貸的錢更不容你不還，近海旣撈不到魚，因此而不得不在絲毫沒有保障之下，拚死開到無際的海天上去，那結果的如何，自然是不必細說了！</p>
<p>香港仔和鴨脷洲的「岸上人」——那些據說是看不起「水上人」的「岸上人」，他們的經營却百分之九十九要靠被看不起的「水上人」——漁民來支持，自經被看不起的「水上人」受到了殘殺焚燒之後，在看不起的「岸上人」經營上也就受到大大的影響。而然，這裏有一個畸形的現狀，就是自抗戰以後，港九的房屋旣被租賃一空，於是一些找不到樓身之地的難民，便轉而跑向這塊不大被人們注意的地方來。因此，人口就急劇地增加。但是，這裏的房屋本來就不多，空屋更少，而人們的需要却很迫切，於是業主們便藉這種時機，發他一發趁火打刼的「横財」，——把房租大大提髙。直到現在，這裏每一憧房子，都像罐裝的沙甸魚一樣，塡滿人了；可以做生意的，更都普遍地以兩三家不同的營業，共佔一個舖面，還有，就是那些戰前從來不被人家注意到的，簡陋狹隘的屋子，亦被重注而加以修裝粉飾，草地上在低詹下灣着腰做起生意來。這種擁擠的淸形，實在並不下於香港的本部。</p>
<p>維持這裏與鴨利洲間渡河交通的工具，是一種小巧玲瓏的渡艇，船頂蓋弧形的藍色或綠色的船蓬，船中舖着供搭客憩坐的花席，在小小的艙裏，板壁上都設着一個可以陳列東西的木架，架上舖着悅目的繡花布墊，和一些頗爲精緻的茶具，座鐘，鏡子等用物。船行起來時彼左搖右擺地幌着前進，頗使乘客有像坐在搖籃裏的孩子感覺。這種「艇仔』是「艇妹』或「艇婆』們靠着過活的工具，捨用它載客渡拇，博得一點微利之外，有時也給並不十分闊氣的人雇去「遊河」。</p>
<p>另外一種較大的艇，那裝璜就比較富麗了，艙中掛着一盞大「保險燈」，並懸掛着許多珠子，艙壁上儘是一些畫鏡，或「艇妹」的「玉照」，架上遍擺很多杯盤花挿之類的東西，這種艇專門給人「玩」的，每當月白風淸之夜，一些色鬼或「道友」們，便到這艇上去「遊河」——其實是坐而不遊，或臥而不遊的。這些艇妹都是掙扎在死亡綫上的漁夫們的妻女，因爲無法生存而墜落至榦這重非人的勾當的，爲着中活的鞭撻，他們不能不塗脂抹粉，掩飾她們那本來面目的「難睇」，而成爲一個和「岸上人」差不多的「有辮嘜」。她們擅唱漁民獨具的一種歌——婉轉悠長而動聽的打情罵俏的「鹹水歌」歌的內容雖無可取，但那哀感幽怨的情調，是安份足以代表她們的勞苦，而使有心人聞之應爲傷心落淚的！</p>
<p>這裏的特產——「生猛海鮮」向來是被人們所稱許的。專賣「生猛海鮮」的幾間酒家的生涯都很不惡；當星期和其他的休假日，更是門庭若市，座無虛位。所售的魚，都是活生生豢養在海裏，等顧客要的時候才去捉起來活煮——這就是所謂「生猛」的意思了。「生猛海鮮」的代價很昂貴，平均每兩三塊錢成本的魚，就得要你十塊八塊，然而儘管酒家們的竹槓敲得怎樣起勁，但吃魚的「闊人」自然是不在乎這一點的，也許他們認爲要這樣才能顯示「闊」呢！</p>
<p>有人說過這樣的話：「到香港不到香港仔去吃海鮮，就不算時髦」。大槪是錢太多的人，不做幾次「寃大頭」就太豈有此理的意思。</p>
<p>跟着歐洲風雲的動盪，香港仔在防禦上做下了許多工事，而且從報上所傳，港政府因這裏髙山水深，是一僩天然的避風處所，而有意把這裏改爲一個軍港——把全部漁船趕到黄竹坑去，如果實行，明日的香港仔情形如何，却就不是我們所想像的了，</p>

<h3>在韶關</h3>
<p>— 微波</p>
<p>在黑暗中，坐着車子，像死一樣掠過南華寺，跨了漂亮的曲江橋，駛到北門車站，兩整天的車程，至此才告一段落。</p>
<p>初擬遊南華，後因途中受阻，躭擱時間，車過時，巳經黑夜如墨，未得一覽勝地，誠憾事也。「恩愛無常，離合有期」，游山玩水，亦有前緣，這眞令人難以索解。大抵人生要有曲線有波紋，才得算人生的意義。</p>
<p>韶關——新的「廣州市」，是省政府所在地，廣東的政治重心。在這一個政令所出的地方，人口的迅速增加是免不掉的，人口大大的增加，住就成了問題，旅館有人滿之患。好些人住到艇七去，渡其水上生活，我也嘗過一夜滋味，總覺得有點不痛快，馬上搬家。市街上，自然比從前繁榮得多，茶樓酒館，利市百倍，大有供應不來的樣子。</p>
<p>也許是因爲地理上，環境上的關係，警報來得很頻繁，瘋狂的×人的飛機，也來施毒過好幾次，市民飽警到創子手的毒辣，越加加强了抗戰勝利的决心和信心。警報既然已經是司空見慣，大家就很有經驗，一聞鳴鳴聲，都把自已的東西安頓好，跑到安全的地方去留（足旁）達（足旁），毫不覺得慌忙。</p>
<p>韶關的防空情報綱做得不錯。爲着市民的便利，市街上懸掛了不少報吿牌子。把×機的數目，行踪，都明明白白寫上去。我也曾實地體驗過一次一走警報」，見到各方面都能够負責，秩字很好。中國人很少有機會到郊外運動的，這一次，拜侵略者之賜，每大都可以散散步，對健康上，大有裨補！</p>
<p>與暴發戶的家庭一樣，從前的寒酸氣是不容遮掩得過來的。韶關雖然意外地交了鴻運，可是，有許多地方都顯示出它的魄力不够應付、尤其是物買的缺乏，會影響到事業的推進，無形中遲頓起來。吳菊芳先生發起組織合作社。確是先急之務，大家都很盼望其成功。</p>
<p>我到了韶關，許多朋友向我訴苦，不是物質糧食的缺乏，而是精神犧食的缺乏，書報雜誌，很少很少，許多日常要看的，都買不到手，報紙從香港運來，最快也要差一個星期。從事寫作的人，更感到參攷材料的欠缺，頗有動筆難之嘆。</p>
<p>吳先生在省政府附近，辦了一個圖書合作社，來供應環境上的急切需求，得到外間很好的批評，現在已陸續的派人到各地搜購書籍，以充實內容。務期好好地把它栽培成爲一個豐當的文化倉庫。</p>
<p>韶關，本來是一個交通很方便的地方，鐵路，公路，四通八達，可是因爲交通工具，不够分配，許多都未得到合理的供應。市區內人力車也很少，車費也貴得驚人，起碼就要國幣兩角，聽說因爲市區面積太小，從前坐車幷不多，所以車費比別的地方昂貴。現在車少客多，更沒有减價的道理。戰時交通管理，是非常重要的，車輛的調節，工程的監理，人事的配備，都需要嚴密的科學管理。由于我沿途所見到的實際情形，我希望各地方當局，能够加以特別注意</p>
<p>電影與戲劇　影評</p>
<h3>姊妹花</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>姊妹花有一個哀感頑艷的故事、那是較之於胡鬧凑趣的所謂滑稽片、的情駡俏的所謂艷情片來得髙明的，</p>
<p>作者是有些喟嘆於風景如昨、面目已非的、他用尼德一家去赴總統競選跳舞會始、也用總統競選跳舞會終、前後呼應、處理得很純熱老到、然而也因之更使人引起大地逆旅、人生朝露之感、「白頭宮女在、閒坐說玄宗」的作風、固然悠樣然有它所謂迴腸盪氣的詩意、可是它傳染給觀衆的、却總是消極底灰色、</p>
<p>而其實、像「姊妹花」這樣的故事、如果導演者要强調它的社會意義的話、也未始不是可以做到、並且是很容易做到的、例如對於佛蘭克的遭遇、用正面來寫它、並且强調它、然而現在並不這樣、全戲的重心却放在露意絲身上、佛蘭克祗是成爲一個陪襯、而她的兩個妹秩海倫和格奮絲的悲歡聯合、也祗是成爲陪襯、</p>
<p>用售點放在露意絲身上、那自然是决定於導演者的世界觀和人生觀的：他太注意了人情而忽略了社會、殊不知人倩的出發、却是根據於社會的、</p>
<p>因之姊妹花給人感到的情趣就祇是悠然和惆然、而它的社會價値、也止於此、</p>
<p>如果看戲的願望原祗是想得到一點無可奈何的惆悵之感、那麽「姊妹花」是可以歸到于好的一類中去的、尤其是導演者能够處處控制着這樣的情調、例如、</p>
<p>（一）魯苡和佛蘭克的夜遁、海倫和格蕾絲在梯畔窗畔的相送、荒凉的馬路上、有一輛馬車得得地載着一對情人遠去、</p>
<p>（二）佛蘭克失業之後、瞞着魯苡絲去充船上的水手、在臨別前和魯意絲吿別的那一刹那、</p>
<p>其它、加赴會前尼德一家的凖備、以及介紹魯意絲和佛蘭克的出場、也都有很好的手法、而兩次赴會前的不同的、來客賓以及魯意絲初次聞佛蘭克來走扶梯時的疾趨而下、和結婚後從拳擊場囘來的蹣跚、都是很好的對照手法、這些手法是簡潔而且意味深長、但却缺少一點力量、而導演者如異肯化點氣力、多生意一貼社會價値、却不是做不到的、例如佛蘭克失業到各報舘去求業的疊印、便很緊凑有勁、而佛蘭克聞舊金山地震返輪不准、轉想泅水至岸幾個場面、也較爲有力得多</p>
<p>埃洛爾弗林在這個戲裏飾佛蘭克、演技很不弱、我們看過他的「鐵血將軍」和「羅賓漢」、以爲他專會演好勇鬥狠一路的脚色者、在這僩戲裏、却也居然沉着老到、而那股武俠片中的英俊之氣、更使人感到男子漢的挺英的可愛、蓓蒂黛維絲的露意絲也不壞、這位大眼睛的女演員很能曲曲傳達她的身份和情緒、卽如飾二妹海倫的愛泰妮露絲、也有很好的演技、其它的配角、也相當的配搭齊全、在看厭了胡闊凑趣、打情罵俏的片子之後、看到這樣頗有文藝趣味的片子、雖還嫌內容的欠積極、却也不能不說是略可一看的片子、</p>
<h3>好萊塢大導演陣容</h3>
<p>續</p>
<p>（十八）茂文今洛埃</p>
<p>Melvyn　Le　Roy華納兄弟的女婿、現在是米髙梅的術片人了、過去他名片很多、性質亦多不同、如社會片「亡命者」歌舞片「四十二號街」文藝片「風流世家」等、「魚水之歡」是他在華納公司最後一片、以後在米髙梅監製Dramatcl　School（露意絲藥娜寶蓮髙黛合演）和StanUP　and　Fight（洛勃泰勃主演、范達克導演、）</p>
<p>（十九）安東立伐克、Anatole　Litvak他本是歐洲的偉大導演、有「春江花月夜」等名片、到好萊塢後第一炮「戰雲情淚」並不響、但接着仔華納的「金技玉葉」「化身大盜」「三姝淚」都不錯、他是曼琳霍金絲的丈夫、</p>

<h3>快樂天使　（九）</h3>
<p>她走向窗前去、在經過哈立面前時、她着實的望了他一眼、哈立差不多要開口了、但是在她的臉上、却找不出一絲還記得他的神氣、似乎她的看他、只是因爲討厭他對她的注視而已、她走到了窗前、「啊！一個飛機場」她忽然叫起來、「這樣多的轟炸機、」</p>
<p>正在這時候、聽見了一聲號筒、她靜下來了「這是什麼、」</p>
<p>「不必顧慮、」唐納在一旁解、「我想這是爲戰爭用的、」</p>
<p>「戰爭？」她接上去、這是不會有戰爭的、亞契、是不是不會育戰爭的？」</p>
<p>「是的、不會有戰爭、」亞契魏博平靜的說、在他的唇上有一種奇異的笑容、「他們都準備得太充足了、」</p>
<p>「你、」愛琳樂意的笑了、一他們不會夜起來、他們都太互相畏忌了、他們會穿起漂亮的軍服、趾氣髙揚、自命是英雄、但是、他們不會打起來、魏博先生也這樣說、他是知道的、」</p>
<p>等他們去看房間去了、哈立問唐納、「那是誰、」</p>
<p>「那是一個歐洲的大人物、亞契魏博先生、」</p>
<p>「那女的呢、」</p>
<p>「我猜想是他的太太吧、」</p>
<p>「你也只能「猜想」、」哈立坐到鋼零面前、彈奏起一隻俄國歌、叫「夕之歌」、</p>
<p>第二天晚飯後、在會客室閑坐、哈立遇見了她、她止和一對新婚度蜜月的英國却乃夫婦坐在一起、魏博先生不在面前、却乃先生、替他們介紹了一下、在介紹時她是除了「夫人」之外、沒有其他的名姓的、</p>
<p>她談起許多她到過的地方、和所遇的驚險、然後、她第一次直接向哈立問話、「范先生、你到過這些地方麽？」</p>
<p>「沒有、我只在奧末黑演過戲、」他眼晴緊緊的釘在她臉上。「夫人、你也到過奧末黑麽？」</p>
<p>「奧末黑、在什麼地方、波斯嗎、」</p>
<p>「它是在美國、我們自已的國裏、」</p>
<p>這時、有人來說魏博先生請她去、她就道着歉起身去了、等她剛離開、這間房、有位客人帶了一張新聞報走進來、「有什麼消息、」却乃先生很嚴重的問。</p>
<p>「戰事已開始、若是你要知這眞正的事實、去問那位大人物魏博先生好了、他能給你一切的戰爭新聞、因爲那是他造成的、他在世界各地都組織着軍火製造廠、人民對于和平的願望、都被亞契魏博這一帶人毀滅了、」</p>
<p>在亞契魏博的坐起室裏、愛琳面向着實口站着、魏博在她身後、來回的度着、</p>

<h3>足球頒獎表演賽　南華南壓倒港聯　馮景祥與李惠堂各為己隊勝三球堪稱雙絕　乙組賽南華以二比一挫聯隊</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】本屆足球、市道極旺、由頭到尾、生意興隆、昨天頒獎表演賽、又吸引迷民萬千、上山觀戰、好不熱蘭、</p>
<p>連樣好戢、演出精彩、看得迷民心花怒放、齊聲叫好、南華兄弟、掄元一捷、畢竟奇才、昨均壓倒聯軍、盡露冠軍顏色、</p>
<p>兩場戰事、可紀的事特多、待我道來、莫嫌碎層、（一）乙組賽在下半時、南華將七、多位脚生毛病、筋弔作痛、你倒我倒、已不成軍、而其竟獲二比一勝利、眞是奇踏、也是僥倖、（二）甲組賽的港聯隊、中鋒李惠堂與守門譚均幹、搭擋以來、從未敗績、可是他倆這個紀錄、昨天已沒法保持、卒被南華南打破、差幸破于「自己人」的脚下、沒甚相干、還顯得「阿拉」的本事、（三）南南中鋒馮景祥與港聯中鋒「東方標準球人」、均演「帽子戲法」（皆射中三球之謂也）。的是球增罕有這麼凑巧的事、（四）歷來頒獎表演賽、祇有甲組、沒有乙組、此次特別加押、看客又多、是一個新紀錄、</p>
<p>一幕工力悉敵的球戰、那得勝的一方、自有其得勝的原因、那失敗的一隊、也自有其失敗的癥結、像昨天南南壓倒馮聯、最顯而易見的、是南南作戰有聯絡、前線進展極合作、弄到港聯守將、抵禦不來、遂判別勝負、然其前線因有惠堂這個危險人物、獨破三關、尙稱得力、惟「夏楚方慶彈冠、漁陽頻驚聲鼓」、終因防衛稍差、得不償失</p>

<p>景祥與惠堂、原是一家人、又慣於合作、但昨天各爲一隊効力、分庭抗禮、而二人演出、亦各有獨到之處、最祥以技巧制勝、精伶活躍、惠堂以射門獨步、足下够戚、各有千秋、堪稱前雙絕、惟景祥有柴北華輔助、則慶合作得人、惠堂離開景祥、便感孤單寡助、故景祥「連中三元」、事實得北華助力甚大、至惠堂則不然、所獲三球、靠個人之力爲多、以其寡助而有此戰功、意見偉大、</p>
<p>說到各農表演、南南方面、前線祇李恩良還欠經驗、略見侷促、此外都出色、前衛線以郭英祺最爽辣、惹人注目、他個子最小、而本領至髙、眞不能「以貌取人」、劉慶材員囘原位、供傳有路、比任左前衛好得多、內衛兩李、脚法淸脆、尤以國威屢阻惠堂之進展、爲座上客所稱道、惟惠堂仍能乘隙破三關、足見惠堂是不易被制肘的、</p>
<p>港聯方面、前線能有三球的獲得、攻力誠不弱、惟防衛力因更動幾人、略爲减削、而其失敗就基於是、</p>
<p>昨天駕臨觀戰之達官貴人、有輔政司史美、正按察司麥基利哥夫婦、周壽臣爵紳、及華人代表羅文錦夫婦、還有我和你、</p>
<p>球賽完畢、由足球總會正會畏輔政司史美演說、讚揚本屆足球成績之優越、及向各球人嘉勉一番、旋由羅文錦夫人頒發本屆甲乙丙三組尋常杯冠軍獎品、最後南南隊長包家平代表贈花與羅夫人、歡呼三聲而散、三組冠軍題名如下、</p>
<p>甲組冠軍南華南（每球員得金牌一枚）</p>
<p>乙組冠軍南華曾（每球員得艮牌一枚）</p>
<p>丙組冠軍士員隊（每球員得良牌一枚）</p>
<p>乙組冠軍南華隊以三比一戰勝聯軍後、萬人注目的全港精英大會、活現眼前、新冠軍南南少却「炸彈」梁榮照、調慶材守中路、以梁伯偉反串右前衛、右內錄黎兆榮足部扭塲、由「靑年將士」李恩良補上、港聯的主幹人物、雖未掃數登場、然素來髙蹈之大吿山奴、也一現色相、球迷皆感興奮、但前衛線主腦比路度缺席、戰鬥力不無影響、（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>上半時戰况</h3>
<p>兩陣對圓、戰事爆發、眨眼間、已見惠堂策馬渡河、來頭甚兇、但終爲英祺拒退、斗文沿邊推進吿遇着容生、也不得逞、由是你來我去、戰情可觀、</p>
<p>（九分鐘）惠堂乘間而入、遙施冷矢、疾如流電、冢平迅速接救、化險爲夷、景祥進兵、與廣森合力逼得角球、開來雖好、但景祥放的是過山砲、跟着惠堂又來一記猛射、也不中的、</p>
<p>（十七分鐘）廣森邊陸起義、北華右路策應、與景祥互相傳遞、像得獅子滾球、均幹處在危球之下、心兒躍躍、搶前奪救、然而景祥巳先掃射、球中門柱、反彈而出、均幹苦苦糾纏、無奈景祥跟着掩至、輕輕一撥、令到均幹囘天乏術、（一比零）、</p>
<p>（廿一分鐘）已而景祥又來突施冷箭、其勢殊勁、惟均幹機警、迅速接收、致未成災、</p>
<p>（卅一分鐘）北華疾傳、景祥接着猛射、但成野矢、那邊廂、惠堂領軍幾度進攻、也無效果、</p>
<p>（卅二分鐘）景祥越過夏仙、遠射地球、均幹攢救得力、化干戈爲玉帛、上半時一比零南南先勝、</p>
<h3>下半時戰情</h3>
<p>下半時五分鐘、榕生在前衛綫犯手球、被判由英祺主踢、韓尼波路在門左頂球、爲景祥所截、猛射中鵠、（二比〇）、</p>
<p>（五分半鐘）南南再勝球後、中圈復開、惠堂突進、在離門廿碼許、冷然遠射、家平不知有此、遂吿失守、一比二港聯報以一點顔色</p>
<p>（十二分鐘）斗文遠傳廣森、頂交景祥、景祥不待球兒落地、卽射入網、連中三元（三比一）</p>
<p>（廿分鍊）斗文過關輸運、均幹以守將不及回師、奔出搶救、怎料被北華先到一步、一撥入網（四比一）</p>
<p>（廿五分鐘）澄滔疾馳而前二閃過天生、在底線傳遞、吿山奴從旁接應、妙交惠堂、惠堂不負所托、開弓見血、（二比四）</p>
<p>（卅四分鐘）散場聲中、南南作戰稍懈、被港聯急攻一頓、惠堂得李安納的傳遞、射中紅心、也演「帽子戲法」、三比四之局、港聯受挫、</p>

<h3>來論平衡物價問題</h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>（一）這問題應如何看法</p>
<p>雖則現在誰都感覺到物價貴得利害、可是各人都以爲這是戰時應有的現象、事實確然如此、而且中外一律、大家爲了戰時應有的現業、便都咬緊牙關忍耐、這足以反映全體國民堅苦卓絕的犧牲精神、是値得向世人自豪的、</p>
<p>不過我們决不能以其爲勢所必然、便任其所之、因爲有不少人、便在利用這種理由、操縱着物價、故意抬高、爲了國家民族的整個利益、任何人固應堅定犧牲一切的精神、但事實上我們也不能否認、物質生活上的忍耐、畢竟有一定的限度、同時更應考慮的、國民生活被髙價物壓迫到不能維持的時候、對于抗戰是不會有什麽帮助的、</p>
<p>而且這問題、與其說、「目前已有切實解决的必要」毋寗說、「爲了將來的安全、現在已非先籌「防微杜漸之計不可」因爲當前物價飛漲的主要原因、旣都知道與戰事有關、那末在戰爭尙無結束希望的今後、也就在刺激物價飛漲的一切原因繼續存在的今後、勢必還有無限沸騰的危險、是無可疑義的、</p>
<p>（二）物價高漲的理由分析</p>
<p>戰爭的存在、爲什麼足以刺激物價飛漲、這理由很簡單、就拿現在的事實來說吧、</p>
<p>（一）戰前、國家的經費、最多不過八九億元左右、像民二十六年度的槪算開了空前的髙紀錄、也不過十億元多些、但從戰事發生以來、因為軍費的急速大增、據說已超過二十五億元以上、這就是說、商品的需要量幾較平時超過二倍以上、需要增加、物價當然也要增加、像上海、又因人口驟增、需要也就大增、但這不是重要的因素、因爲、</p>
<p>（二）如果需要增加的、同時生產也能同比率增加、那末物價的上升、還可依着曲綫進行、不致越漲越髙、可是我們的生產事業、平時已那麼落後、戰時又破壞到不堪一覩、不特是工業設備已殘破不堪、廣大的農村、在戰區裏也都輟耕、加以日軍的到處掠奪、更增大了物資的消耗、擴大了供需不平衡的闊度、</p>
<p>（三）國內半產激滅、外加日方的掠奪、我國的出口能力於是大減特減、出口减少、便影響到國際收支平衡、加以我國的軍需品以至民需品、大都仰給海外，於是幣値的本身旣感受威脅、何况日方又竭力攜亂我國的外匯、自發生外匯黑市場以來、幣値竟跌去四折左右、幣値跌落、進口物價勢必飛漲尤烈、因此政府與民間購用外貨的貨幣負担尤大、國內流通的通貨量、自然也非增加不可、</p>
<p>（四）通貨流動額增大時、如果商品的流通圓滑、那末通貨刺激物價的程度、還可在交易率的增大消减下去、可是戰區的交通綫、又皆爲日方控制、貨運就是依頓外商、也不能應付裕如、因此供需失調下形勢更見嚴重、物價上升的勢力也就更雄健、</p>
<p>（五）在商品流通過程內、除了貨運困難之外、還有許多阻碍、日僞在戰區內沿途對物敲索、今且進而推行其所謂「貿易統制」、此外運費、保險費、和內匯匯水的增漲等等、也無不都在加强供需失調和物價漲勢漲的程度、</p>
<p>這許多刺激物價的壓力、都是戰爭的產物、戰事存在一天、那末上昇的可能、也就存在一天、由戰爭造成的這些髙物價的苦痛、我們固可以最後勝利的收穫來抵消、可是除了這些自然理由外、還有投機、操縱、壟斷、居奇等等現象、而且這些現象對於物價上的影響、來勢更兇、在各種貨物價內要算出投機價格所佔的地位、果然不可能、但是也可隨便舉個例來證明他在現在物價水準裏所佔何種程度、</p>
<p>（三）物價水準裏的投機價格</p>
<p>譬如去年底至今年初、上海米的存倉數、實際並未减少、以米市季節來說、這是全年內米價最軟弱的時期、但這次却反乎常例、忽開始急漲、飛漲的理由、據說爲了日軍收買、所以上海有米荒危險、大家競爭囤購、爲防荒圑購、固無不可、但可疑的何以米價漲到十四元的限界、便不再上昇、如果眞有米荒危險、卽使在强有力的統制下也會發生暗市、像去年奪發生米荒時的暗市一樣、而且米價漲到十四元、日軍何不再繼續收買、如說貴了收買要吃虧、但日軍收買任伺東西、都不照市價給錢、貴不貴、與枚不收、根本不聯繫、後來聽說、這次米價的漲風、可當上海米商的「不平之鳴」看、因爲現在除了米價一項還和戰前相等外、其他皆已大漲特漲、</p>
<p>現在髙物價的因素之一是外匯關係、米價固不受這種影響、因爲他們是土產品之故、但棉花也是土產品、何以他不能像米價一樣穩定、如果晚爲了需要、那末棉花的需要不見得比米更大、如果說因爲日僞統制和苛征、米也何曾不受同等待遇、但是現在綿花的市價、巳較戰前半年平均價漲起百分之五十以上、棉價的上漲除了供需等事實原因外、大半原因實在被飛漲的紗價帶起的、試看去年一至十月、紗價是不斷上漲、棉價是漲跌互見、因此去年全年紗價平均較廿六年一至八月漲起三二·三％、而棉花價反跌二·一％、今年一月紗價、較戰前八個月平均漲五二·五％、棉價亦帶漲至四四·％、（且經濟統計月誌本年一月號第六滬表）</p>
<p>何以紗價會如是激漲、當然與前述的許多理由都有關、但投機成分更有關係、雖則從生產減少上、可以提出許多關於生產設備焚燬的數字來證明、但上海畢竟是棉紗的出產量、供給總數他地容易、在流通並無使紗價大漲的理由、而且他是國產、也無通貨影響、上海紗價向有支配全國紗價的地位、如果他的價格確屬合理、那末不能利用內地的需要價任意髙價待沽、但現在都因內地紗價奇昂、上海紗價也就籌景提髙、所以弄成今日越漲越貴的情形、要知利用需要來高價待沽、這止就是投機操縱的伎倆之一、</p>
<p>我們不妨再從增別上來比較、上海物價的漲勢、較內地實在還要厲害、爲了村料限制、姑以民廿六年七月及民廿七年八月比較一番、</p>
<p>上海與內地之物價指數比較（一九三七年全年平均物價爲基期）</p>
<p>民廿六年七月　民廿七年八月　增加</p>
<p>上海　九七·四　一二　七·六　三三·二</p>
<p>廣州　九六·三　一二二·二</p>
<p>二五·九</p>
<p>重慶　一〇四·二　一一　三·一　八·九</p>
<p>（註）上海廣州原係一九二六年爲基凖、改算以一九三七年全年平均爲基期、俾與以一九三七年爲基準之重慶指數比較如上、材料參看中國國民經濟研究所出版中外經濟年報、</p>
<p>上海在廿六年巳發生戰爭、其餘粵川居後方、把該年全年平均物價備基準、與以後的物價比較、照理上、應比內地的增加率爲低、但竟適得其反、像已由前方變爲後方的民廿七年八月份額上海物價、反較內地漲得利書、以內地物價昂實爲影響上海物價的理由、然不能成立、月反證上海投機程度遠咬各地利害、（完）</p>
<h3>中國金銀政策之行程</h3>
<p>— 傑</p>
<p>此項規定辦法、對於中國戰時財政顯有可能發生的利益、當有下列兩點、</p>
<p>第一是法幣的深入民間、單就白銀說、自法幣制度實行之後、政府所收集的白銀、除去各銀行原有的準備金不計外、在一九三六年六月底止、共爲二萬二千五百萬元、但據估計、歷年輸入出的結果、國內最少應有存銀七萬萬元、最低限度可能集中者當有三萬萬五千萬元、則國內最少應尙有半數散在民間、現在規定各地銀錢行莊得收購充作領券準備金、是使得法幣更能普遍的進入窮鄉僻壤、</p>
<p>第二是海外資金的增加、所謂海外資金卽是能够供爲國際間支付的財貨、目今世界各國雖然均已停止金本位、但是黄金在國際收支上仍是保有價値儲的職能、至如白銀、雖沒有黄金那樣有儲藏的職能、但在中美貨幣協定下、中國不難將白銀易爲黄金、現在通過此項辦法的運用、則對於收集各地金銀、比較單藉收兌金銀辦學處去辦理、自然更易收效、而迅速地增加海外的資金、</p>
<p>中國戰時收集金銀政策的進展、就本文第二段所論述、以至於現在施行的銀錢業收購金銀辦法、可見收集的方法意趨多元化、防弊的章則、愈形嚴密化、而在短短的一年半間已進行到如此地步、殊可贊許、至於以收集金銀作爲戰時財政政策中的貨幣政策、代替了通貨膨脹的貨幣政策、以與稅租公債互相配合的政策平行運用起來、這一種的戰時財政政策、是値得研究的、</p>

<h3>文學作品中的「氛圍氣」問題</h3>
<p>— 郁華</p>
<p>現階段的戰士們所需要的是精神糧食，現階段的戰士們底頭　還需要加以武裝。光是口號，光是喊破了喉管的單純的作品，巳經是屬於昨天的了。</p>
<p>我們的先進的作家們，都深深地感到了這一點，幷且都關始走向着『要普及要提高』的路途去了。那是一個追隨着戰爭的極好的現象</p>
<p>最近，各地的讀者們，甚至在戰壕裏的英勇的戰士們，對於文學作品，漸漸發生熱烈的愛好。他們爭讀着充滿了火藥味的戰地報吿，新型的充實的詩歌，激動着人們的心魂的劇本，以及美麗的壯健的小說，他們談論着每篇文學作品中所顯示的人物與生動的戰鬥的場景。終於，他們漸漸感到了文學作品的不够。</p>
<p>是的，我　誰也不會滿足地承認抗戰來我們的文學作品在量上在質上已經相當够了的吧？</p>
<p>現在找所要提及的是文學作品的實的問題。但是我並不想在這裏檢討過去。特別想提出的是我們的作家，對於文學作品的『氛圍氣』的問題太少注意了。</p>
<p>在　裏　應該引一段福斯脫說的話：</p>
<p>『如果作者想提高他的人物的現實性，想把那種動作所要求的緊張性給與他的作品中的主要契機，那麼這種很難得到的物與環境的微妙關係，對於他是最重要的東西。自然，這止是大部份以社會現象爲主題的小說所缺乏的性質，社會主義作者對待『氛園氣』的態度，當然和舊寫實主義作家不同，可是他並不能輕視它，他可以從過去作家裏和從現代最好小說家那裏，學到同樣好的創造『氛圍氣』的方法。……作者必得試書很微妙地去表現『氛圍氣』的轉變』。</p>
<p>目前，我們的國家是浸在轟轟烈烈的鬥爭中，每個人的生活的每個細小部門，都跟這偉大的神聖的鬥爭密切地繫結着。因之，我們的文學作品是反映着這些偉大的動態，而且藝術地組織着人們的意識。屬於昨天的那些作品，如果由我們的作家的手在今天再寫出來，將收穫怎樣的成果，我們是可以想像到的。</p>
<p>作家寫作一部作品，必需在用自已的作品中對於『氛圍氣』的轉變過程，非多多注意不可。『氛圍氣』的轉變過程中，必需抓住這些新的因素。并且　要很自然地控制『氛圍氣』。</p>
<p>當我念高爾基的『四十年代』，他對於　木金，對於鄧姍沙，都賦與了一種在他控制着的『氛圍氣」中所影響及的性格與行動，我們可以從它的反面去解釋。在這部成功的大著作中。我們可以去研究這些『氛圍氣』是怎樣創造的。——我們十萬不要忽略了高爾基的生活底充實！</p>
<p>所以，多觀察現實也是必需的！幷且要精密地去分析它，要　中去了解現實的發展與成果的構成底新因素。</p>
<p>必需寫出戰士們所需要的精神糧食，能够跟戰士們生活在一起，於是我們作家將寫廿最體貼的作品來。——被提出了的文學作品的『氛圍氣』的問題，是緊緊連着充實我們的作家底生活的那問題的。</p>
<h3>鄉下人</h3>
<p>— 綠</p>
<p>下午，兩個二十多歲的鄕下人，手裏都拿着一隻藤籃，一前一後走向小城門邊來。在前的一個，看見了守衛的黄衣人，照例向他鞠一躬，將籐籃放到地上，打開蓋頭，聽由他檢査。</p>
<p>黄衣人只有一個，他照例一聲不　，板起了面孔，一手扶着槍俯下身去，一手翻亂着藤籃裏的東西，爲了不耐煩，一翻出來，就向地上一摔。</p>
<p>在後的鄕下人，開始也在前的一樣做着，鞠躬，將藤　放在地上，打開蓋頭。可是黄衣人正在檢査着第一隻藤籃，沒有注意到這第二隻藤籃，而　又正有些偏在他的身旁，爲他所不大容易看見。</p>
<p>倏然那在後的鄕下人，在第二隻勝籃中，取出了一件黑黑的小東西，趁黄衣人低着頭，就將那小東西的口，對準了他的太陽穴，板了一下。拍的一聲，黄衣人倒在地上，血從他的兩太陽穴，直湧而出。</p>
<p>兩個鄉下人，將藤籃丢在地上，囘身就奔。</p>
<p>響聲　動了大城門裏關帝廟中的其他黄衣人。他們，約五六個，連忙趕出來看。一瞥之下，知道了究竟，他們留兩個人伺候在地上的人以外，就都出城追着。然而過了弔橋，轉了兩個灣，到了十字街頭，他們就沒有辦法了，只好停下來躇躇着　‘</p>
<p>當然他們不曉得來人已經從那條街逸去，不能向那條街追去，還有，他們很知道，不論那一條街只能再走半里，就是盡頭，再過去就是田野和鄉村。而田野和鄕村呢，却止是他們輕易不敢深入的禁地。</p>
<p>在他們向街上人詢問而毫無結果之後，他們彼此嘰咕了一回，就只好回向城衷去。</p>
<p>在小城門邊，他們一面收拾着死在地上的同伴，一面再檢査地上的東西。在各破衣服亂紙頭之間，他們發見了一封信，抽開來一看，裏面有這樣的幾句話。</p>
<p>……不要死賴在城圏裏！有種的下鄉來，咱們在戰場上見個高低！要是不下來，咱們亦會上來。</p>
<p>現在先給一些顏色你們看看，……</p>
<p>底下有正式的具名；××軍第××隊長李一龍。</p>
<p>一切事情都交到了駐城的司令部，司令就差人找郭老二來商議。</p>
<p>郭老二本來是地痞，素爲鄕里所不齒，爲了歡迎黄衣人有功，他們，就派他在「警察局」辦事，從此他說得了法，有財有勢。</p>
<p>郭老二到，便說，這事不能輕易放過，至少也應駭示示威，他們商議了一番，就分一半人。約五六十個，排隊出城，到了十字街口，不管左右，就一直向前趕去</p>
<p>街道盡了，不過又三里。就到了個鎭上。這是郭老二的故里，大家看見郭老二走在一羣黄衣人的頭裏，便不約而同地向他投出了毒視的眼光。暗暗地罵着，不要臉的畜生，（未完）</p>
<h3>在春天</h3>
<p>— 長</p>
<p>戰士，才子，貓，老人篇</p>
<p>現在已經是春天了，是呵，他會帶來了温暖，舒適，逢勃，生命之活力。我們喜歡春天，但常常有温暖，蓬勃，生命之活力。春或計有它底誘感性，然而决不能使英勇的理智的戰士苦悶，懊惱，煩躁，雖然冰天雪地中的他們在春天是更活躍了起來，持續着更嚴厲害的鬥爭，雪萊說：『如果冬天到了，春天還會遠嗎？』對了；就是這個春天。</p>
<p>『暮春三月，江南草長，雜花生樹，羣鶯亂飛』，這原是春天之現象，但還不會把握了春天底豐富的意義，我們愛江南，也愛江北，愛長草，愛雜花，也愛白山，也愛黑水，甚至愛冰雪，愛風雨，愛　雹，愛雷電，租國可大地到處是温暖着的，有它底香味，就使不在春天要，我們更表露着偉大的愛，所有的永遠是更大的力，我們永遠在發揚着堅强的戰鬥底力呢。</p>
<p>在或種才子底感覺裏，春天是會變成懶洋洋和死纏綿的。：『良辰美景奈天何，賞心事誰家院，』道不是兒夕底眷天的煩惱嗎？』萬金寶劍藏秋水，滿馬春愁壓綉鞍，』那原是工愁善病的英雄式的春天的性之苦悶啊。普天之下的風流才子也不少，『流水落花春去也，天上人間。』正是沒落前的斷腸聲，『留待心魂在，殘軀討刦灰；靑火不滅，夜夜照燕台』！『少年頭』呢，在春天失節者不免要暗暗發洩一下的，雖然依然那麼遮遮掩掩的一副。</p>
<p>我們來謳歌春天之力的偉大罷，卽使或種人不敢正視。</p>
<p>今年的春天底襲來帶着肅殺，冷酷，我們却更用着悲壯而愉快的心來撫摩着他，然後議他悠悠地飛掠過去，明年的春天還要來呢！</p>
<p>不錯，要來的，明年的春天。但卽令是春天吧，凄寒的白骨上也不會長出花兒來的，武士道的才子們底悲哀的情緒給觸　了，他們憤怒，怨恨。苦惱，愁煩，『春闔夢裏人』啊，接着數口一縷幽幽的長氣，除去野蟹獸性發洩以外，祇是滿腔虛空，『等是有家歸未轉』呀，呀，呀！</p>
<p>於是春天之美話來了，貓在屋　上呌着，屋簷下武士道的才子們聽得了立刻歇斯的里地瘋狂起來，終於下了總攻擊，一小隊總包抄去，東，東，東！叫春憂然而止，貓跌倒下去。但更寂寞，才子們更凄凉萬分，『苦悶的象微』！敏着眉　咬起牙，他們和貓同感，在春天。</p>
<p>然而，他們底國內是沒有春天的，『該國當局昨日招待電影界專家，解釋收府新通過之機關認爲有不良影響之描寫倖運游戲之影片，亦在禁止之外，（據四月六日海通電。）』天哪，他們把貓的心這樣地先絞死了，自已早衰老了下去，不承認這條地這紋死了，自己早衰老了下去，不承認這是春天——但卽使要返老還童』罷，也是一囘天乏術』了的；預防這個春天，先就實行了閹割的工作，對於軍需資本家底瘋狂的享受呢，照例是熱視無視，這是一萬萬新的增稅在作崇。）</p>
<p>他們給你一憫不承細，叫一些年青的才子們飲　吞聲』（武士道的『呼天推槍地』精神早絕去了傳統。）可是道個反映却是愈續見其基礎之不穩的。</p>
<p>憶昔愛親覺羅氏是朝之末年，雖然也到了遍光返照的恃期，而對於『奉天承運』的技巧做得倒還　　的，兪樣應『淡烟疏爾落花天』之試，曾有『花落春仍在』之句，極獲官家探　，（見春在堂筆記。）那是迎合了統治者底『掩飾』天下必然沒落的事物心理。『春天常常留在這兒的，發！一　，現在呢，不曾聽見他們重新　下去。僅僅『掩飾』一番聯慰寂眞。愛氏統治層本身的『空虛』早可了然。然而該皇朝之不諱言『落花大』的沒洛現象。無疑地還有着莫大的勇氣，他們是承認春天的。</p>
<p>在衰老時期，還要　割了春天，某××的崩潰這是指顧簡耳。—隨你不承認春天或否的便罷。</p>
<p>某戰士在苦難中塡下算子一詞，雖也有些才子意味，却頗見其戰鬥的風度。其後半　是；『花落知春殘，一任風和雨；信是明年春再來，應有香如故。」</p>
<p>今年的春即使嚴肅而冷酷，但我們以悲壯而愉快的心來迎他，，明年的春底到來會更温暖，我們也更歡欣。</p>
<h3>末等人</h3>
<p>— 文宗山</p>
<p>啄木鳥專門在樹木裏找尋它的食糧，而寄居在樹木中的害　永遠在避免它的目標。</p>
<p>社會裏也永遠對立着兩種不同的人，决不能用情感來解决，就是勇敢者和末等人。</p>
<p>深夜，想　這種小的間題，希望能給我一個異常準確的答案，把我思慮澄淸一下。</p>
<p>今天我找到了一個圓滿的解答，見到了象形的啄木鳥和腐蝕虫，乾脆說，勇敢者和末等人在對敵地串演很生動的壯烈的事跡。</p>
<p>穿入利的誘惑中，墮在祿的深深淵裏，這樣一個人，末第的傢伙，給勇敢者按正義打死了，有人驚奇，這是『暗殺』。我說；平淡無奇。許多人有願意爲『淘金而死』的事情，何况這死的爽快與它的只求名利的『下海』迅速，成了個正比。你說奇，大約是驚奇他死的方法平淡，沒稱大家心，在司法下把它處死吧。</p>
<p>腐蝕蟲絕對逃不出啄木鳥的尖嘴，你應知道；當它尖銳的嘴和舌捲上了蟲之後，便是吿訴你答案的機會。</p>
<p>末等人總有一天爲勇敢者所結果。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>窗外的天色，已經明亮，混濁的空氣，不曾展開，陰暗還充塞着每個角落；這不是理想的早晨，晴朗的天空，火紅的太揚——</p>
<p>突然，她醒了。</p>
<p>這時候，在梳粧台上，有人已經給她備好了新的牙刷，牙膏，毛中，肥皂，還有盛了暖水的臉盆。</p>
<p>她懶懶地挺了一下身體，不經意地一望，望見了站在她床前的一個人。她認識他——昨夜的暴徒，引路者，陪伴，保護人，他的一切，都已不是她昨夜的記憶的印象，他換了整潔的學生服裝，頭髮梳得非常整齊；看來，像是受過高等教育的學生，或是一個有思想的無業靑年，量低也是有禮貌的公司職員。總之，現在他是一個不會使人發在反感的人，而且可以使人覺得他的可愛：高大而　康的身體，寬洞而凸起的胸脯，尤其是充飽　靑春的精力的臉色，藏不住微笑而謙遜的眼情。從他現有的姿態上，再看不出他昨夜的勇敢，横　，疑慮，聰敏，無情而又有情的遺痕　今日，他是一個平常的靑年，幾乎平常得毫無個性。在他那平常的　上。她發現了昨夜未曾發現的他的天性，善良而純潔；他是有着一切靈魂之美的化身。昨夜和今天，其間祇是人生說短的一段距離；但他昨夜是使人逃選的，今日是使人接近的，他表現了兩種完全相反的型。</p>
<p>在她看見他　頸圍起新的繃帮的时候，被一種英明的力量所引動，而他自已暫時忘在憂慮的境遇之中。她從床上起來，仍是穿　昨夜未脫的衣服。地彷彿是一個遭到意外不幸的病者的友人，在初次的慰問，她非常關心對方的傷痕，雖然她　已知道對方傷痕的由來，但是，還慣常地，不必要地問一名：　（四六）</p>

<h3>Can the Anti-Aggression Front Exclude the Far East?</h3>
<p>For days, newspaper commentaries have focused on discussing the anti-aggression front and the Far East, uniformly arguing that the anti-aggression front should include the Far East. This is a subjective demand: China hopes so, the Soviet Union hopes so, and even the United States has the same hope. However, more important than this subjective demand is objective development. Many people still doubt that the anti-aggression front can necessarily include the Far East. Their argument is: if the aggressor nation in the Far East does not join the European disputes, but remains neutral outside the camps of the European aggression bloc and the anti-aggression bloc, as Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma said on the 30th of last month, "Japan does not belong to the democratic group, nor is it a member of totalitarian countries," then it seems that Britain, France, the United States, and other countries do not need to oppose Japan. More specifically, Japan can take advantage of the period of the European war to concentrate on its aggression in China, forcing China to submit, while temporarily not infringing on Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, nor participating in the actions of Germany and Italy. Then, for the convenience of fighting in Europe, could Britain and France temporarily indulge Japan? If Britain and France's actions in the Far East are not active, the United States and the Soviet Union will naturally maintain neutrality. Some even take the opposition of Japanese elders and important ministers to Japan's participation in the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan as an argument that Japan will inevitably remain neutral.</p>
<p>However, the actual development of the problem cannot be so simple and mechanical. We dare to assert that the development of the European anti-aggression front cannot but include the Far East, otherwise, an effective anti-aggression front cannot be formed. Our arguments are:</p>
<p>1.  When the European war breaks out, the Far Eastern war will inevitably converge with it, forming an inseparable whole. Almost all countries participating in the European war have intertwined interests in the Far East. On the one hand, they must protect their own security in Europe, and on the other hand, they must preserve the integrity of their rights and interests in the Far East, so that the execution of the European war has a purpose. Britain and France will not abandon their colonies in the East, nor will they easily sacrifice their rights and interests in China. However, when a European war occurs, it is precisely when their Eastern colonies, especially their Far Eastern rights and interests, are most at risk. To avoid this danger, they will inevitably make appropriate preparations and actions in the Far East, and also need the help and convenience of countries in the Far East that are implementing anti-aggression, for example, Britain needs the cooperation of the Chinese army to defend Hong Kong. Thus, the anti-aggression front actually includes China.</p>
<p>(2) The European anti-aggression front cannot be without the participation of the Soviet Union. Britain and France, who are currently leading the anti-aggression front, must first be able to deliver on their guarantees of security to the small countries of Eastern Europe. To guarantee the security of the small countries of Eastern Europe, they must rely on the support of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's relationship spans both Europe and Asia. It is not only threatened by European aggressors but also by Eastern aggressors. In fact, Eastern aggressors have repeatedly tested their aggressive gestures towards the Soviet Union. In this situation, the Soviet Union, which participates in the European anti-aggression front, will inevitably take the expansion of the scope to the Far East as a condition. Thus, the European and Far Eastern battlefields are linked together.</p>
<p>(3) Japanese aggressors will never let go of the opportunity to swallow Asia as a whole and "expel European forces from Asia" to fulfill their dream of dominating Asia. When war breaks out in Europe, Japan cannot maintain a compromise situation of non-aggression with Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as some people have speculated. It will also take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to advance north to annex the Far Eastern territory of the Soviet Union and advance south to "sweep away" the forces of Britain, the United States, and France in the Pacific, or even further occupy their colonies. When the "September 18th Incident" broke out, Japan did not take the opportunity to occupy Siberia. Later, it became a matter of regret and debate in Japanese military and political circles. They believed that the Soviet Union's Far Eastern construction had not yet been successful at that time, and it would be easy to occupy. When the second opportunity comes, I believe Japan will never let it go again, because by that time, they believe that the Soviet Union is busy with the West and has no time to take care of the East. In this way, even from the perspective of aggression, it is inevitable to push the Far East into the scope of the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>(4) Furthermore, judging from the struggle for merit between the army and navy factions of the Japanese military, the Japanese navy will inevitably invade the Pacific when the European war breaks out. Needless to say, British Hong Kong and French Annam, even Singapore, the Philippines, and even Australia and India, will become their targets of aggression. The Japanese navy is now gradually in a situation where heroes have no use for their talents because the Chinese battlefield has moved inland. The navy faction is unwilling to fall behind and will inevitably strive to implement the southward policy. In today's situation, where the storms in the Pacific are becoming increasingly diffused as the European issue intensifies, not only can Japan not turn a blind eye, but Britain, the United States, and France cannot believe that Japan will not reach out its claws. The situation of non-aggression between Japan and Britain, France, and the United States cannot naturally be formed, and the struggle between Britain, the United States, and France and the Japanese aggressors in the Pacific is inevitable. How can the European anti-aggression front not extend to the Far East?</p>
<p>According to Shanghai telecommunications, various countries are already considering inviting China to participate in the anti-aggression front. It can be seen that the Far Eastern anti-aggression front is developing.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Yen and the Sharp Blade</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wute Gong</p>
<p>This article was written by Guenther Stein in Hong Kong at the end of last year. The original title was "The Yen and the Sword," published in the March issue of "Pacific Affairs." Reading this article, it can be seen that Japan's war against China, even if it does not fail due to major military setbacks, will inevitably fail due to economic helplessness. As long as China can persist in the war of resistance, it will surely achieve the final victory. The full text is translated as follows.</p>
<p>The Monetary Foreplay of the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>Currency has proven to be one of the decisive weapons in this Sino-Japanese War. Although many close observers of the war overestimate the importance of currency, both China and Japan have long understood this fact. Two years before the actual military action, the Sino-Japanese currency war had already been actively underway. At the beginning of 1935, the Japanese took the offensive, attempting to link the currency of North China with the "Yen Bloc." They fully expected to separate the five northern provinces from the central government in this way, and finally conquer them completely without Japan shedding a drop of blood or spending a single bullet. They imposed this move on the unwilling country, not only relying on diplomatic and military pressure but also using various chaotic political activities in the north. Originally, China's old silver coins were in a dangerous state. The Japanese deeply felt that there was an opportunity to take direct aggressive action in the financial market. The method they took was to plunder China's silver, especially the silver in several northern provinces, which was China's legal currency.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan sent personnel to North China to buy silver coins and silver bars at an abnormally low exchange rate for foreign exchange at that time. Under the review and guidance of the local Japanese authorities, the operation went smoothly, and a large amount was obtained. Although the Chinese government had issued a ban on the export of silver, it could not stop the smuggling of silver to Japan. The total amount transported to Japan is not recorded in the officially published import reports. However, once connected to Japan, it can be clearly transported to England. According to Japan's published foreign trade statistics, the total value of silver transported to England from 1934 to 1936 was more than 275 million Japanese yen. Needless to say, this silver all came from China, because Japan is not a silver-producing country. After the silver was transported to London, it was sold at the world's high market price maintained by the US government's purchase policy, making a great profit. However, this level of profit was due to a chance encounter. The real motive for this movement in Japan was not to seek profit but to plunder North China's deep-rooted currency reserve, so that it could not maintain its financial position and would have to be put into the hands of the "Yen Bloc." In the future, the same method could be used to gradually dispose of the entire China.</p>
<p>Although this attack caused China great losses, it failed to achieve the main purpose of the Japanese. Because the central government responded to the situation and suddenly implemented currency reform on November 3, 1935. This move was indeed too late, but it was still a way to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. As a result, silver was completely nationalized, no longer used as legal currency, and no longer allowed to circulate in the market. Instead, banknotes issued by government banks were used as substitutes. In other words, China has switched to a "managed" currency to avoid Japan's attacks, as most other countries have done before. China immediately set about collecting all the silver still left in the country. The government was able to collect at least 100 million yuan (Chinese currency). China therefore preempted Japan. Because this silver can not only serve as a hard currency reserve for new banknotes in peacetime but also serve as a powerful emergency fund in wartime, which can be freely disposed of by the government for the purpose of purchasing military supplies overseas.</p>
<p>The two ends of China's logical countermeasures in the undeclared currency war, especially the latter, made the Japanese very uneasy. As a result, Japan's political attitude towards China and Britain turned tough. The reason why she hated Britain was because it was rumored that China's countermeasures were instigated by Britain. Japan initially firmly believed that China's currency reform, purely from an economic point of view, would fail in a short period of time. She believed that China was a backward, only half-unified, and unmanageable country, and the government's power and credibility were not enough to make the current national managed currency a success; in addition, the Chinese people had been accustomed to using silver for thousands of years, and now they were suddenly asked to change to banknotes, which could buy foreign exchange but could not be exchanged for cash, and would never gain the trust of the people: the Chinese government's reform, although it had recovered from the currency difficulties, would soon face new difficulties, even more severe than the previous one. At that time, the "Yen Bloc" would have all kinds of unexpected expansion opportunities. Who knew that China's currency reform would be smooth sailing and achieve remarkable results, resulting in general economic progress, which was faster than the Chinese government expected. When this reform was obviously becoming a tool, and the central government used it to rapidly increase the country's political unity and overseas credit, the panic in some aspects of Japan became increasingly expanded.</p>
<p>The Astonishing Power of Legal Currency in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>If we say that Japan's armed invasion of China was entirely caused by the effects of China's currency reform, it would be an exaggeration. However, history will probably prove that this was a major reason for Japan's war. It is precisely because the ambition to incorporate the vast area of China into the "Yen Bloc" is indeed not the only purpose of Japan's operation, but this ambition is often revealed in her future plans and is more ambitious than people think. The great military institutions of Japan have finally launched large-scale movements in China. The currency weapon currently appears to be secondary, but it has not been shelved for a long time. Japan has never forgotten its original purpose. Therefore, after the establishment of the new puppet regime in Beiping, the four plans that were first urged to be implemented were intended to lay the foundation for the "Yen Bloc" to expand in the occupied areas. (1) Establish the "China United Reserve Bank" to make the banknotes it issues rely on the Japanese yen; (2) Promulgate new tax regulations to reduce import taxes to facilitate the expansion of Japanese trade within the new sphere of influence of the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>China also greatly relied on the fighting value of the newly formed currency weapon, initially for purely financial and self-defense reasons, nationalizing silver, and the resulting war fund, the amount of which was at least equal to half of the Japanese bank's gold reserves, was fully controlled by the government and fully utilized. This is a major factor why China has been able to exert the astonishing ability of long-term resistance. However, China also knew how to use the currency weapon itself to defend itself, and defended it very carefully. Whenever the Chinese regular army had to withdraw when encountering the superior Japanese army in terms of equipment, in addition to leaving many guerrillas to harass the rear of the victors, it also left one thing that even made the Japanese army feel painful: that is, banknotes. The Japanese were hoping to bring the occupied areas into the "Yen Bloc," forcing the Chinese people to cooperate with the Japanese, developing economic resources to the extreme, and obtaining new industrial and financial strength from military occupation. All these plans were in vain because China's legal currency was just a piece of paper.</p>
<p>China's monetary resistance to Japan's deep-rooted attempts in the occupied areas has been so effective, which is not a fluke. After two years of perfect control in peacetime, the new legal currency has gained the trust of the people. Therefore, the government can carry out active policies based on this trust, even in the areas under Japanese control. The main purpose of this policy is to maintain the inherent price of Chinese legal currency higher than the Japanese yen or any new currency that the Japanese force the occupied areas to use that relies on the Japanese yen. This means that legal currency can still be freely exchanged for foreign exchange, while holders of Japanese yen or affiliated Japanese yen currency cannot enjoy this important convenience. In order to maintain this solid principle, China had to sacrifice a large part of the foreign exchange reserve obtained from selling state-owned silver abroad first. Even at this time, legal currency could still be exchanged for foreign exchange. The continuous outflow of these reserves (mostly due to short selling speculation) gradually reduced the value of legal currency to half of its original value during the year and a half of extremely costly war; however, it was difficult for legal currency to depreciate, and it dragged the currency of the "Yen Bloc" in China down to the same degree. However, people still prefer to use Chinese legal currency, and its strong credit, widespread circulation, and fundamental consolidation are completely the same as before the devaluation.</p>
<p>At the end of 1938, the Sino-Japanese currency war was in a stalemate. China, relying on smart and firm policies, has been able to reduce the outflow of greatly reduced foreign exchange reserves, and the number of outflows in several months is almost zero. Although Guangzhou and Wuhan have fallen, and China has not received foreign financial assistance, China can still balance its income and foreign exchange obligations. Therefore, China can continue to maintain a stable legal currency almost indefinitely, and at the same time promote the ambitious plan of the "Yen Bloc." At least until Japan develops an effective new offensive, this situation will not change. Japan, on the other hand, has only been able to move step by step and is in a defensive position. This is obviously not because of any lack of enthusiasm for her old ambitions, but because she has encountered major difficulties that she has not yet overcome.</p>
<p>The Yen's Blood Blade and Background</p>
<p>At the same time, the "Yen Bloc," which originally included Japan, Korea, Taiwan, "Manchukuo," and the Kwantung Leased Territory, has been expanded to North China in a nominally effective way, and to the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China in an even more nominally effective state. As for the group expanding to South China, it is too weak. The Japanese have never announced any actions or conditions in this procedure, but an analysis of this matter shows that his two major purposes and his current development status are: First, to facilitate Japan's ability to import goods from these areas without the task of foreign exchange expenditure; this move can also enable Japan to sell the surplus products in these areas overseas, and all the foreign exchange obtained will be used exclusively for her, regardless of the damage suffered locally. The reason why the Japanese want to fully control the currency in these areas is not only to achieve these two purposes but also to use this as a powerful lever to promote Japan's general economic development. The method of promotion, of course, meets the wishes of the Japanese military and Japan's own economic needs.</p>
<p>Japan must continuously expand its exports because Japan is implementing two conflicting policies at home. One is to limit rather than increase the purchasing power of its own people; the other is to increase the output of domestic manufacturing industries to the extreme of its technological capabilities. The quantity of some of Japan's trade has indeed increased recently. From 1931, when the "Manchurian Incident" occurred, to 1936, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it increased by a full 100% in these nine years. The development of foreign trade is entirely due to the reduction of selling prices and the great sacrifices made by the country. If war preparations had not absorbed the increased output of Japanese industry, then the gap between Japan's domestic purchasing power and the quantity of goods manufactured by Japanese industry would still not be filled by the increase in exports. Military and industrial war preparations also aim to continue to increase exports. If the current war against China cannot achieve the expected result of finding a solution within the ever-expanding "Yen Bloc," the problem will be more serious in the future. Judging from the following situation, Japan's chances of seizing the Chinese market to win the export of the yen are indeed very slim, and it is even impossible to greatly alleviate the difficulties of the problem. However, this unfavorable situation has added a reason for Japan to try to subordinate the Chinese economy to the "Yen Bloc" so that it can develop to the fullest possible extent whatever trade opportunities it encounters in China.</p>
<p>Before this war, Japan was very dissatisfied with the quantity of its exports to China. In 1936, the last year of peace, China, which had 400 million buyers in Japan's total exports to foreign countries and colonies, accounted for only 4.4% of them; this number was equal to 16.3% of the total amount China purchased from foreign countries. Now, look at how different the situation is in various places where Japanese exporters are under the consolidated rule of the Japanese, where there is no foreign currency intervention, and where the Japanese yen has an advantage! Every Japanese colony, although far smaller in area and population than China, purchased more Japanese goods in 1936 than the country that Japan has always declared to be eager to "cooperate" with and has the largest population in the world.</p>
<p>Taiwan is Japan's oldest colony, with a population of no more than 5 million, accounting for 6.8% of Japan's total exports. This means that Taiwan purchases 83.3% of the foreign goods it needs from the "motherland," 9.1% from other Japanese colonies, and only 7.6% from non-Japanese regions. Korea is Japan's second largest colony, with 23 million people. The Japanese goods it purchases account for 18.5% of Japan's total exports, which is equal to 85.1% of Korea's total imports. The remaining 8.7% of imports come from other Japanese colonies, so Korea purchases only 6.2% of its imports from foreign countries. "Manchukuo" has only been under Japanese rule for a short period of time and has not yet reached the ideal level of relying on its elder brother for "cooperation," but it has made great progress in this regard. In 1930, the year before the September 18th Incident occurred, the Japanese goods purchased by the 30 million residents accounted for less than 6.4% of Japan's total exports. But by 1936, it had increased to 14.8%. In 1930, Japanese Empire goods accounted for 39.3% of the total amount of goods purchased from foreign countries by Manchuria, and in 1936, it had increased to 75.1%. The remaining 22.8% were supplied by foreign merchants, most of which were goods directly or indirectly used by the Kwantung Army for military preparations in "Manchukuo." In 1936, the Japanese goods purchased by Japan's three major colonies accounted for 40.1% of Japan's total exports. In that year, China accounted for 4.4%, while countries completely outside Japan's sphere of political influence accounted for 55.5%.</p>
<p>Judging by analogy with Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo," after the "Yen Bloc" controls the occupied areas and the oppressed parts of China for several years, China will at least ideally allow the Japanese Empire to supply about 70% to 80% of its import needs. But even then, the total amount of Japanese goods purchased by China, based on the pre-war estimates in 1936, may still be difficult to reach 20% of Japan's total exports. In other words, Japan is still making great efforts to oppress the 400 million Chinese people to give Japanese exporters benefits that will not exceed the total amount contributed by the 27 million Taiwanese and Koreans in 1936. By that time, Japan's total exports will be 40%, and it will still need to sell in foreign markets outside the "Yen Bloc." That is to say, the main factor for the continued active expansion of Japanese goods exports will still be the desire of foreign countries to purchase more. But there is one thing: if Japan can completely incorporate China into the "Yen Bloc," it can get a good opportunity to gradually reduce China's current relatively high economic strength. As a result, Japan can make China's currency more dependent on Japanese supplies, just as Japan is currently manipulating Taiwan and Korea to a certain extent. However, this matter is far off.</p>
<p>Now, most of the places occupied by Japan in China have begun to be incorporated into the "Yen Bloc" in a nominally effective way. The trade between the Japanese and the occupied areas is now officially called "Yen Bloc Trade," the same as the trade between Japan and Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo." According to the regulations promulgated by the Japanese military authorities in North China, the newly established "Joint Reserve Bank" banknotes have been used as legal currency in a vast area and can be fully exchanged for Japanese yen; however, the financial policy of the bank is entirely controlled by the Japanese. In addition to the "Joint Reserve" banknotes, the original Japanese yen and "Manchukuo" banknotes have also been strongly set at the same value and are circulating in North China. However, the total amount of these three currencies combined is far less than the total amount of Chinese legal currency in North China. Chinese legal currency is still widely used among the people, not only in the inland counties that the Japanese army has not reached. It still occupies a dominant position among the people, although there is a ban on reuse, and if anyone is found using "old banknotes" without exchanging them for "Joint Reserve" banknotes at an 80% discount, they will be severely punished, but it has no effect. The new situation in North China has allowed Japanese exports to take the opportunity to flood the market. According to Japan's officially announced trade reports, in the first eight months of 1938, the average monthly exports to North China were more than three times higher than before the war in 1936. If we include the exports indirectly transported to North China through the Kwantung Leased Territory (before the war, a large number of Japanese goods were smuggled through this route, which has only recently stopped), its total amount, although the total amount of goods purchased from foreign countries by North China has been greatly reduced due to the war, seems to be more than twice as high as two years ago today. The emergence of the "Yen Bloc" in Central China has so far not been due to the circulation of military tickets issued by the Japanese army to meet military and commercial needs, but it is gradually expanding. However, Japanese exporters are also eager to take advantage of their opportunities there. During the same period, the average monthly increase in exports from Japan to these areas was certainly small, because the purchasing power and economic organization within the territory have been completely destroyed. However, the share of Japanese exports in the total imports of Central China has increased by about four times. In the newly occupied areas of South China, Japanese "military tickets" have begun to be used, and similar developments are expected. These advances are obtained by depriving third countries and Chinese national debt manufacturing of their interests. Although Japan is increasing the Japanese export market by forming the "Yen Bloc" in the conquered Chinese war zone and excluding other countries, it seems that it is currently on the way to achieving the first goal, but it is currently necessary to meet the second goal, otherwise, the "Yen Bloc" will eventually encounter a tragic failure.

<h3>On the Way to Wengyuan—A Casual Chat Among Comrades—Friends of China in China (10)</h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>At five o'clock, Deputy Officer Mo from headquarters arrived, assigned to accompany us to Wengyuan. This young friend also brought a chicken, intended as lunch for the journey. At six o'clock, we jumped into the car and set off on the highway to Wengyuan from Shaoguan. When the car entered Dakengkou, the steel plate malfunctioned, causing the rear to bounce incessantly, shaking violently. The driver stopped to inspect, and we also got out to take a look. Mrs. Li Meng seemed quite familiar with cars and quickly lay down to peer under the car. After getting up, she said, "The bolt is loose, causing the steel plate to loosen. Now the tire is already hot. If we continue driving, I'm afraid we'll burn out the wheel." Continuing, she said very seriously, "When I traveled in North Africa before, the car had the same problem, and many good repairmen there couldn't fix it. I think this driver probably won't be able to repair it either." With her conclusion, the hope of reaching Wengyuan inevitably dimmed. However, the honest driver, who didn't say much, unhesitatingly changed into work clothes, picked up the repair tools, and adopted the same posture as Mrs. Li Meng, lying on the ground. Almost his entire upper body disappeared under the car. With a few forceful movements, he removed the damaged stack of steel plates, then disassembled them one by one, organizing them in a very orderly manner. This expression told us he had a strong confidence that he could definitely fix it. At this point, Mrs. Li Meng changed her previous fatalistic view. She also felt that he was quite a capable friend, so she said, "Let's find a place to sit and chat, and wait for him to fix it before we go!" We climbed onto the earthen slope beside us and sat at the base of a large tree. There were no villages around, and few pedestrians, so it was quiet and still. Somehow, we began discussing many foreign journalists. First, we talked about Snow. I think after "Westward Journey Notes" was published, Snow left a deep impression in China. These friends have a good understanding of the situation in China. He was the first foreign journalist to go to northern Shaanxi and be able to understand it well. The translator's note in "Westward Journey Notes" already has a very detailed introduction about him. He was born in 1905 in Missouri, USA. In his youth, he worked as a tenant farmer, an oiler on the railway, and a printing apprentice, but later he actually graduated from the University of Missouri and Columbia University. The first newspaper he worked for was the Kansas City Star. In 1928, Snow served as an assistant editor at the Shanghai Millard's Review. At that time, Sun Ke, the Minister of Railways of the National Government, even hired him to inspect the railways in the Northeast and at headquarters. As a result, he also wrote several travel guides. His footprints almost covered all parts of the Far East: the three northeastern provinces, Mongolia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, India, Borneo, etc. In India, he became acquainted with Gandhi and many other revolutionaries. He also taught at Yenching University in Peiping for two years, diligently studying Chinese. He was the first to introduce Lu Xun's works to the West. Last year, when he left China to recuperate in the Philippines, the locals asked him to give a public speech. He agreed. When the day of the speech arrived, there were no less than two thousand people in the audience, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. However, the Japanese protested to the local government, believing that Snow was a communist and should not be allowed to speak publicly. The result that day was an unhappy ending. The speech did not take place, and those who attended were very angry and made demands to the government, specifically stating the reasons: first, Snow is not a communist; second, even if he is a communist, he still has the freedom to speak. Later, the Philippine authorities also used this reason to reject the Japanese imperialists' unreasonable demands. Snow finally stepped onto the podium amidst warm applause from an audience of four to five thousand people, more than twice as many as before. In such a scene, he firmly and definitively said: Final victory will belong to China! Indeed, Snow and his loving friend, Mrs. Wales, are both sincere friends of China. Continuing, we talked about Miss Smedley. She was the correspondent in China for the Manchester Guardian of England. During the War of Resistance, she had walked through the front lines of various battlefields and had given several speeches in Changsha, Guangzhou, and other places, all of which were welcomed by the Chinese people. Naturally, she was also a very enthusiastic friend who sympathized with China. Speaking of W.G. Shipp, he was a correspondent for the Pacific Affairs magazine and several newspapers in Paris. Everyone's impression of him was naturally still quite faint. When the Jinpu Railway battle was very tense last April or May, he went from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Through Mr. Hu Ziying's introduction, the reporter met him. Later, we went to Guangzhou together, and he even lived with our friends from the Customs Long March Group, living a collective life. In this common life, we discovered that this friend's work ethic was truly admirable. He went to bed late at night, often after midnight, and got up at four or five in the morning. The sound of his typewriter almost replaced the function of the alarm clock in our group... While we were talking enthusiastically, the driver called us: "We can go now!" The original intention of the conversation was to pass the time, but everyone's inner desire was still related to the car problem at all times, so when they heard: "We can go now!" everyone couldn't help but cheer with excitement! Running and laughing, they jumped down the hillside, and no one had time to end or pursue the conversation that had just taken place! Mrs. Li Meng saw that the car had been repaired better than she expected, and she couldn't help but praise him and asked the driver if he had ever attended a mechanical vocational school. This mental process of Mrs. Li Meng went from distrust to "Let him try it" to surprise and admiration. This is the general attitude of foreigners towards Chinese problems. The situation of the War of Resistance is naturally no exception. We should step up our efforts to let their mental state change from "Let him try it" to surprise and admiration! The saying "Heaven helps those who help themselves" contains profound truth!</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Unveils Its Political Offensive; The Process and Gains of the Western Zhejiang Administrative Conference [2]</h3>
<p>"Revisiting Tianmu, the longing for the capital is endless, the meandering Zhejiang River; it vaguely resembles, the willows by the Six Bridges, the rippling West Lake. The lonely Three Pools reflect the moon at midnight, the Yue Tomb remotely sprinkles tears of loyalty, counting the years of defending the territory and failing the original intention, life is as good as death.</p>
<p>Recovering lost land, starting from today. Yue Jian, should be emulated. Never forget gathering for training, the taste of firewood and gall. Ease and comfort harm the fate of the family and the country. Diligently manage the military with hard work. Pillow the long spear, the rooster crows at midnight, pointing to Fusang." As soon as the recitation ended, the host showed an excited smile, followed by thunderous applause from the entire audience.</p>
<p>The 16th was the fourth day after the opening of the conference, and many people, including the secretaries-general of the county party committees and the standing committee members of the Anti-Japanese Guard Association, participated, because the originally planned party-government-military symposium had been merged with the administrative conference of that day. In the meeting, Chairman Huang personally presided over and presented the cases that had been examined for discussion one by one, divided into eight categories: civil affairs, finance, property adjustment, team organization, military transportation, communication, public organization, and education and culture. The important decisions included: A, strengthening the administrative institutions below the county level, with the principle being: 1. Adjust the district, township, town, bao, and jia organizations, especially focusing on the township level. 2. Determine township and town expenses. 3. Improve the quality of autonomous personnel. 4. Implement integrated management, education, welfare, and defense, laying the foundation for autonomous self-defense. Regarding the candidates for township and town chiefs, it was decided to request those with prestige in the village to take office and to find enthusiastic anti-Japanese youth to assist. The candidates for bao and jia chiefs will be elected by the Bao Min Congress and given strict training through various training classes. The case also specifically stipulates that convening the Bao Min Congress is one of the central tasks of county administration and should be held once a month. The central task of the Bao Min Congress is to promote the spirit of democracy and promote the four major policies of integrated management, education, welfare, and defense, but the most urgent task at present is to universally hold the national public oath. B, improving the Western Zhejiang Tax Office, the principle is: 1. Improve the collection system and strengthen the collection force. 2. Eradicate illegal exploitation in the war zone and reduce the burden on the people. 3. Adjust the monthly tax rate to achieve active economic offensives and passively prevent the invasion of Japanese goods. The main method is to improve the tax collection system. Taxed goods should not be taxed again during transportation, and the tax rate on daily necessities should be appropriately reduced. Goods transported to the occupied areas will be allowed to pass with a reasonable management fee, provided that they do not benefit the enemy. The important decisions on adjusting the economic plan are: important characteristics of the war zone and guerrilla zone should be controlled and purchased by the government, and other usable properties should be transported to the rear as much as possible, and the organization of farmers' production and sales chain (such as cooperatives) and the organization of merchants' transportation and sales (such as trading companies) should be completed as soon as possible, and the input of enemy goods should be absolutely prohibited, and economic blockade should be implemented on the enemy-occupied areas. Regarding the issue of production and processing loans, the meeting believed that: 1. Encourage tea picking, refined boxed tea making, silkworm rearing and tung and persimmon breeding. 2. Organize loans for tea picking, tea making, tea collection, silkworm seeds, cocoon drying, cocoon collection, and silk reeling. 3. Increase the price of export specialties. In addition, there were very concrete decisions on public training, education and culture, and transportation and military departments. After the discussion of the proposals was completed, it was already 7:00 p.m. The chairman also provided answers to the many temporary proposals of the county party committees based on the decisions of the meeting.</p>
<p>The closing ceremony of the conference was held at 8:00 a.m. on the 17th. In addition to the personnel attending the administrative conference and the party-government-military symposium, there were more than 1,000 people, including all teachers and students of Western Zhejiang Middle School, the Second Political Work Brigade, the Wartime Staff Training Class, and all officials. Chairman Huang delivered the closing speech and expressed his feelings about the conference, saying roughly: (1) Regardless of whether the conference was successful, it was a great success in itself, because our ability to hold the conference here proves that we have the will to advance and the spirit of attack. (2) From the reports of the counties, we know that each county has made some progress. (3) This conference broke the previous conference format, and the purpose of the conference was to solve problems, and the result did answer many difficult problems.</p>
<p>The most significant harvest of this conference was the accuracy of all the resolutions and the spirit of harmony, cooperation, and unity shown in the conference process, which enabled everyone who participated in the conference to maintain a consistently high level of morale.</p>
<p>The political offensive under Zhejiang's "offensive politics" has determined a complete implementation plan in this Western Zhejiang Administrative Conference. [End]</p>
<h3>Urgent Needs at the Front: Smallpox Vaccine and Serum</h3>

<h3>Continuous Victories in Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, and Shanxi; The Japanese Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in Shanxi; Over Two Thousand Corpses on Zhongtiao Mountain; Japanese Commander Taniguchi Killed in Action</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Shanghai News: Over 500 wounded Japanese soldiers, loaded on the No. 109 transport ship flying the Red Cross flag, left Shanghai for Japan on the morning of the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 23rd] Six hundred enemy corpses were transported north from Wenxi daily. There are still two hundred corpses in the city. There are also seventy or eighty corpses in Xiangshanzhuang. In Daxiaze, Xiguocun, and Shangguocun, a total of over three hundred corpses are placed. A total of over one thousand four hundred corpses were found to be the corpses of Japanese soldiers who died on Zhongtiao Mountain this time and were not burned. In addition, over four hundred enemy corpses were transported north from Anyi on the afternoon of the 15th, reaching nearly two thousand corpses. This is only a partial statistic, but it can already be seen that the Japanese invaders suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 22nd] Japanese Commander Taniguchi went to the Fushan area from Linfen on the 19th to supervise the battle and was surrounded by our troops midway. Several cars were destroyed. It is reported that Taniguchi was killed in action.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 21st] After we adopted an offensive posture on the Ping-Sui Line, the guerrillas cooperated with the regular army and achieved success one after another. The railway between Baotou and Wangdatong has now been damaged by our troops and it is difficult to move trains.</p>
<p>[Chongqing News Agency, Yulin, 22nd] Our troops attacked the Magaitu Station on the Ping-Sui Railway at 11:00 p.m. on the 15th and almost completely annihilated over a hundred enemy soldiers. The Japanese stationmaster disguised himself and fled to Zhangjiakou. We seized a large number of military supplies.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Prospects for China's War of Resistance; Soviet Pravda Publishes Special Commentary</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Moscow, 22nd, TASS: Soviet Leningrad Pravda recently published an article entitled "The Liberation War of the Chinese People," stating that the war in the Pacific region is the first national liberation war of such a large scale. The Chinese people have shown unprecedented resistance to imperialists in the midst of oppression for the first time. The Japanese aggressors in China are now being resisted by millions of armed people organized into regular armies and guerrillas. The barbarity and cruelty of the Japanese bandits have not only failed to break the resistance of the Chinese people, but have strengthened their combat preparations. The actions of the Chinese guerrillas have repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the Japanese army. The entire Chinese people are permeated with the idea of striving for final victory in the protracted war of resistance. Patriotic Chinese men and women have responded to all capitulationist arguments with a strong rejection. The Chinese people are uniting all forces, preparing to make a major blow that will completely defeat the enemy. The amazing unlimited energy of the great Chinese people is hidden, and the source is vast. The reason why all powerful classes of the people can unite and fight against Japanese bandits cannot be separated from the establishment of the anti-Japanese national united front. The Chinese people, relying on their own strength and the assistance of progressive mankind, are confident that they will achieve final victory. The revolutionization of the Japanese rear is of great help to this. The living conditions of the Japanese people are deteriorating, prices are rising, and many companies are closing down due to lack of raw materials, leading to a continuous increase in unemployed workers. The harvest is decreasing day by day, and the number of conflicts between farmers and landlords is increasing. The dissatisfaction of the vast masses of the Japanese people affects the maintenance of military morale. Incidents of troop mutinies and damage to military discipline are becoming increasingly common. The protracted nature of the war, the huge military expenses, and the Japanese government's reliance on domestic debt to make up for its consumption, as well as the National Mobilization Act, have all sharpened the contradictions among the Japanese ruling class. The newspaper concluded by saying that the powerful anti-Japanese national united front, the increasing unity of the Chinese people, and the disintegration of Japanese imperialist spies and agents in the Jingwei faction and Trotskyite bandits all guarantee that the Chinese people will achieve glorious victory and complete liberation.</p>
<h3>The 5th Annual Conference of the Geopolitics Society: Discussion of Wartime Land Policy, Concluding Today in Chongqing, with President Chiang's Address</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The China Geopolitics Society held its 5th annual conference opening ceremony at 8:00 AM on the 23rd at the Eastern Sichuan Normal School. Chairman Nian Zheng presided, and President Chiang delivered an address offering encouragement. The Central Executive Committee dispatched Minister of Social Affairs Mr. Chen Lifu to attend and deliver an address. Representatives from the Ministries of Education and Interior also participated. Land administration agencies from various provinces sent representatives carrying detailed reports and proposals. As of last night, over seventy units, including those of Ji Yu and Zhu Zongliang, had registered their members. Members who made special trips to Chongqing to participate included Zeng Jikuan, Dean of Academic Affairs of the National Northwest Agricultural College; Gao Xin, Director of the Guangdong Land Administration Bureau; Tang Qizi, Director of the Jiangxi Reclamation Office; Zhu Ping, Director of the Sichuan Land Reporting Office; Hua Xi Reclamation Company; Tang Huisu, Director of the Yunnan Reclamation Area; and Zhang Daochun, representative from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. The society received over fifty theses and solicited articles, which have been compiled into a conference proceedings and various monographs and special publications, providing valuable references for post-conference research on land administration.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The 5th annual conference of the China Geopolitics Society opened in Chongqing at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, presided over by Chairman Xiao Zheng. Minister Chen Lifu delivered a speech, stating that the implementation of land administration work is the foundation for completing local self-governance. Everything, from surveying households, training soldiers, organizing land, reclaiming wasteland, opening transportation, and increasing production, relies on the detailed discussions of the conference attendees to inform government decisions. The first general meeting was held at 2:00 PM to discuss China's post-war land policies. The second general meeting will be held on the morning of the 24th to discuss economic development in the Southwest and land issues. The closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Original Text of President Chiang's Address</p>
<p>President Chiang's address was as follows: "Fellow members of the 5th annual conference of the China Geopolitics Society, 'Do not hoard wealth that should be abandoned on the ground; do not begrudge effort that should not be devoted to oneself.' Exerting human effort to develop the benefits of the land embodies the principles of improving livelihoods and utilizing resources to their fullest extent. The Principle of People's Livelihood, advocated by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, takes equalization of land rights as its guiding principle. Articles 10 and 11 of the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction further specify its concrete methods. As local self-governance begins to be implemented, it is particularly important to set land prices and cultivate wasteland. The people rely on the land for their livelihood, and the full development of land productivity depends on the effective use and distribution of land. Neglecting the benefits of the land will inevitably lead to local desolation. This not only breeds social inequality but also impedes the progress of economic life. All of you embrace the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and are diligently studying land reform. You should know that strengthening the power of resistance against Japan greatly depends on the development of land resources, and the day of victory in the War of Resistance will be an excellent opportunity to thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. If you can adapt to the times, examine sound regulations, and carefully explore policies, so that farmers are no longer burdened by their plows and the masses benefit from increased food production, then the land policies advocated by our party for decades can be expected to be realized quickly. This will not only contribute to adequate food and strong soldiers but also benefit the current situation of the War of Resistance. Zhongzheng believes that resolving the land problem is the most urgent task in implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. What I expect from you is not only to pool your wisdom during the conference but also to conduct separate, in-depth, and practical discussions after the conference. It is not only to formulate general plans but also to address the specific details of land policy, rectify past shortcomings, and offer practical and feasible solutions. I hope you will all strive to achieve this."</p>
<h3>The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army: Recent Situation of Bitter Fighting in the Northeast; The Japanese Army is Unable to Massively Enter Shanhaiguan Pass, Completing the Task of Strategic Containment</h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from Harbin, 23rd] The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, which persists in heroic fighting in the Northeast, has been intensifying its active operations since the start of the War of Resistance, employing skillful guerrilla tactics to continuously strike at the Japanese and puppet troops. This has prevented the Japanese and puppet troops from massively entering Shanhaiguan Pass to fight. In the entire Chinese national anti-Japanese war, the Northeast Volunteer Army, scattered among the mountains and rivers, has indeed coordinated with the Supreme Military Authority to accomplish the glorious task of effective strategic containment.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from a telegram sent by the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, outlining the general situation of the anti-Japanese war waged by the soldiers and civilians in the Northeast: (1) The Li Regiment of Yang Jingyu's First Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army engaged in a fierce three-hour battle with the Zhou and Yu regiments of the puppet army in the Shibanhe area of Mengjiang County on March 11th. The puppet army abandoned over fifty corpses and fled in disarray with a large amount of ammunition. (2) The Cao Regiment of Yang Jingyu's army engaged in combat with the Zeng Yuan unit of the Japanese army in Shiqing Donggou area of Ji'an on the morning of March 15th, killing over fifty Japanese soldiers. We also suffered some casualties. (3) The Liang Detachment of Yang Jingyu's army surrounded the command of the Japanese and puppet mountain forest suppression team in the southeastern ridge area of Xiangdian County on the morning of March 20th. In addition to killing sixteen people and capturing twenty-four alive, they occupied the command. Another guerrilla detachment engaged in a fierce battle with the Nakagawa and Tomimori units of the Japanese and puppet troops and the Myanmar puppet police in the Mujihe area of Myanmar County on March 6th, inflicting countless casualties before withdrawing. (4) The more than five hundred men of Li Yanlu's Fourth Army, who were conducting guerrilla warfare in Yiguan, Bohe, and other counties, engaged in fierce battles with the Song Kui unit's Hirota suppression team on March 5th and 6th. The Japanese army was taken by surprise and suffered heavy casualties, fleeing in disarray. We also suffered over fifty casualties and handed over five captured Japanese soldiers to the "Political Security Company" for education. (5) The Li Xuefu Regiment of the Seventh Army encountered the Taniyū unit of the Qianfu unit of the Japanese army in Laoying Manxing of Raohe on the evening of March 11th. The Japanese were caught off guard and the entire army collapsed, and we captured a cannon and several machine guns. (6) The Miao Detachment of Xie Wendong's Eighth Army engaged in combat outside Baoqing City in early March, fighting extremely fiercely. After achieving a major victory, our army entered the deep forest for rest and reorganization. (7) Several hundred men under Li Huatang of the Ninth Army ambushed the Sawada suppression team of the Japanese army on the eastern mountain area of Jiamusi on March 17th. As the Japanese army passed by, shouts of killing arose, and over a hundred Japanese and puppet troops were killed, and three armored vehicles were captured.</p>
<h3>The Various War Zones of North China in Heroic Resistance: Administrative Institutions Gradually Recovered, Material Assistance Awaits Debate</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] County Magistrate xxx of a county in the occupied area of Hebei went to Tianjin from Ningjin on the 2nd of this month, then transferred to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong via sea defense to Kunming to go to Chongqing for official business. The reporter took advantage of his stay in Hong Kong to interview him. He described in detail the situation of the military and civilians resisting Japan in the occupied area. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Strong morale among the people in the occupied area: Mr. x said first that the Japanese army in the occupied area intends to "sweep up" our guerrillas at all times. Currently, the Japanese army has 300 troops stationed in each county, with strict defenses against our guerrillas, but they are often embarrassed by the guerrillas. The morale of the people in the occupied areas of North China is extremely high because we still maintain administrative sovereignty in each occupied county. All government orders are presided over by responsible officials, no different from non-occupied counties. Among them, there are even female county magistrates, who are all able to work hard and lead the anti-Japanese work. There is no distinction between front and rear in the guerrilla areas, so the most difficult problem is the placement of wounded soldiers. As for the supply of medicines, it can still be barely managed.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's attempt to undermine our finance is unsuccessful: Regarding the Japanese army's attempt to undermine our finance in North China with counterfeit currency, Mr. x said that this move has clearly failed because counterfeit currency cannot flow into the guerrilla areas. In order to force the absorption of our national currency, the Japanese army has set strict rules that those who possess five or ten yuan or more of the national currency will have it confiscated, and those who exceed one hundred yuan will be executed. The conspiracy to undermine our finance and the viciousness of the methods are evident from this. However, after the Japanese army searches for banknotes, they often seize them for themselves.</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army has □□0,000 troops: Mr. x continued to describe the situation of the Eighth Route Army in the occupied areas of North China, saying that the Eighth Route Army has a regular army of x divisions stationed in various parts of the area. However, although the number is only x divisions, in reality, including the guerrillas, there are a total of xx0,000 troops, so the expenses are quite strained and have to be greatly reduced. The supply of ammunition is particularly difficult. Currently, the most used in the guerrilla area is hand grenades, because the large bells of the temples and the homemade gunpowder of the villagers can be used to make hand grenades. As for the current location of the guerrillas, the main distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>Troops: Areas of Stationing</p>
<p>Dike: As far as northeast of Beiping</p>
<p>Deng x: Eastern Hebei area</p>
<p>Xu Gou: Eastern Suiyuan and Chahar area</p>
<p>Xiao x: East of the Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>He Long: Central Hebei area</p>
<p>Nie Rongzhen: Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region</p>
<p>Liu Bocheng: Southern Hebei area</p>
<p>Charging ahead, retreating behind: Mr. x also said that since Chairman Lu Zhonglin of Hebei took office, the political power has been concentrated, and the Communist Party members of the Eighth Route Army have set an example in order to achieve the solid unified front and avoid unnecessary disputes between parties. At the same time, they also lead the people to achieve the following goals:</p>
<p>Charging ahead,</p>
<p>Retreating behind,</p>
<p>Lightly wounded do not leave the front line,</p>
<p>Seriously wounded do not cry in pain,</p>
<p>Give up life but not the gun,</p>
<p>Shed blood but not tears,</p>
<p>Therefore, the impression of the people of North China on the Eighth Route Army is extremely good, and the spirit of military-civilian cooperation is demonstrated everywhere.</p>
<h3>US Fleet Commander Leaves Hankou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A dispatch from Hankou on the 23rd states that Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, visited here a few days ago and returned east by ship on the 23rd. In addition to Rear Admiral Yarnell, the ship also carried the entire staff of the Soviet Consulate in Hankou, ten Soviet citizens, a TASS reporter, and some American citizens.</p>
<h3>Freedom to Hang National Flags: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests Against French Concession's Interference with Flag Display in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Regarding the matter of the Shanghai French Concession authorities interfering with the freedom of Chinese residents to hang national flags within the concession, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had lodged protests with the French Embassy on two occasions last month. Recently, the authorities forcibly removed and confiscated our national flags on April 19th and arrested residents. Upon learning of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately demanded that the French Embassy correct the attitude adopted by the authorities and guarantee that they would no longer interfere with the residents' freedom to display their national flags in the future. The Shanghai French Concession authorities have now returned the confiscated national flags and released the arrested residents. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still not satisfied and has made verbal and written protests to the French Embassy, demanding that they no longer interfere with the freedom to display national flags in the future.</p>

<h3>Competition Between European and Asian Blocs to Enlist Smaller Countries; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Near Conclusion; Chamberlain to Issue Statement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, today reported to the Soviet government on the British government's views on the European situation and plans to travel to London tomorrow. This move indicates that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations are nearing completion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] There is much speculation here about whether the future agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will include the Far East issue, while news from Paris is clearly different from what was reported in London yesterday. Political commentators believe that after the Soviet ambassador returns to London, Chamberlain will issue a statement early this week outlining the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] "The Times" diplomatic correspondent pointed out today that Britain's policy towards the Balkans is to establish a group of neutral countries adopting a mutual aid system. At the same time, "The Observer" diplomatic correspondent stated that the talks between Britain, France, and Turkey are for the Eastern Mediterranean issue. "The Times" diplomatic correspondent discussed the relationship between Poland and Romania in the anti-aggression front, saying that the two countries have the same views on Soviet aid, and the relationship should be rebuilt. Therefore, the Polish-Romanian treaty should also be amended. The Romanian Foreign Minister's visit to London should be able to explain everything.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 22nd] "The Times" diplomatic correspondent here stated that Britain is convinced that the Soviet Union will express deep sympathy for Britain in the event of war and will provide practical assistance to its Western European neighbors. However, it is not yet possible to say what kind of agreement will be signed between Britain and the Soviet Union. The correspondent also stated that the Soviet Union's joining the anti-aggression front will be a positive step in establishing collective security. The correspondent mentioned the negotiations with the Balkans, saying that Britain is very aware of Bulgaria's position and difficulties. However, the Balkan countries forming a solid front is the only effective way to prevent aggressive countries from dividing or controlling Southeast Europe, and it is pointed out to Bulgaria and its neighbors that their interests are consistent and that an agreement must be reached immediately.</p>
<p>European Situation to Undergo New Changes</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Political activities in various countries continue unabated. The European situation seems poised for new changes. Today, newspapers here unanimously emphasized these activities. Democratic countries and the Axis powers are now competing with each other to enlist smaller countries, hoping to complete this before Friday, as Hitler will respond to President Roosevelt's suggestions on that day. "The Times" wrote today, "Although the diplomatic situation is ever-changing and constantly uncertain, one thing is certain: Britain should develop its combat power to the highest level in the shortest possible time." At the same time, several newspapers, led by "The Observer," discussed the conscription issue again. They unanimously believed that the issue would be discussed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. At the same time, it is widely rumored that France has suggested this issue to the British government as an emergency measure in peacetime.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] European diplomatic activities continue unabated. The Axis powers are putting pressure on the Balkan countries, especially Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, which has attracted close attention. Axis countries are reportedly attempting to mediate the disputes between Hungary and Yugoslavia and are willing to allow Greece to reclaim Thessaloniki and hand it over to Yugoslavia in exchange for restoring the 1913 border. However, the current goal of the Axis countries is to isolate France and then attack French colonies.</p>
<p>Italian-Yugoslav Talks to be Broadly Discussed</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Venice, 23rd] The Italian and Yugoslav foreign ministers held their first talks here yesterday. The general atmosphere was good.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Venice, 22nd] Reportedly, the first meeting between the Yugoslav and Italian foreign ministers went well. Before arriving in Venice by train, the Yugoslav Foreign Minister solemnly stated during a meeting with guests that the recent declarations by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano regarding Italy's intention to maintain friendship have greatly pleased the Yugoslav people. Italian political figures believe that the agreement signed between Hungary and Yugoslavia will be one of the main topics of discussion at this meeting between the two foreign ministers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Venice, 23rd] After the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Foreign Minister, a communiqué was immediately issued, declaring that various issues related to the international situation of the two countries and the Albanian event had been discussed. The communiqué attested to the extreme friendship between the two countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yugoslav Capital, 23rd] Political circles say that Germany and Italy are inviting Yugoslavia to participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact, or at least demand that Yugoslavia state that it has no intention of joining the defensive alliance led by Britain and France. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister is scheduled to visit Germany on the 26th, and the German side will naturally exert pressure on him again at that time. However, according to responsible sources, Yugoslavia will not be involved in such machinations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yugoslav Capital, 23rd] Ten thousand young people representing various universities and political parties in Yugoslavia held a mass rally yesterday, resolving to support the democratic countries and urging the government not to use the guise of neutrality to conspire to aid the aggressor countries.</p>
<h3>British Conscription System: Implementation Seems Inevitable; Cabinet to Make a Firm Decision</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 23rd] It is widely believed that Britain is about to implement a disguised conscription system. In recent weeks, Britain has made careful preparations for this step. The British government will actively discuss it this week. According to "The Daily Telegraph," the cabinet meeting on Monday will decide on this issue, and it is expected that the cabinet will agree to a partial conscription system. If the cabinet decides to take this step, then all men aged 18 to 21, except for certain professions, will be conscripted and will receive military training within a few weeks. It is said that the change in the British government's attitude is due to the recent note from the French government, which stated that nothing would convince the smaller countries of Europe of Britain's determination to resist aggression more than implementing some kind of conscription method. Chamberlain was deeply impressed by this. According to estimates, a limited conscription system will initially enlist 500,000 men, which is faster in terms of mobilization than the Territorial Army's suggestion. French Ambassador to Britain Corbin visited Chamberlain on Friday and said that France welcomes Britain's adoption of some kind of conscription system, and that this move would best demonstrate to the world that Britain's preparations for contingencies are extremely thorough.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Informed sources in political circles here recently declared that the implementation of a conscription system in Britain is inevitable and that the cabinet will make a firm decision within the next week. Sir Vansittart, the government's diplomatic advisor, recently returned here after holding negotiations with the French authorities in Paris and reported to Foreign Secretary Halifax that French public opinion was very surprised that Britain had delayed the implementation of a conscription system under the current situation. In addition, General Gort, Chief of the General Staff, also stated to Prime Minister Chamberlain that unless Britain strengthens its army, it will be impossible to fulfill the military obligations it has recently accepted. In addition, the Army Department recently began recruiting volunteers, hoping to double the number of reservists, but the results have been unsatisfactory, which shows that the implementation of a conscription system is inevitable and cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 23rd] It was announced yesterday that only 65,390 men have been recruited by the voluntary army of both sides from March 19 to April 18, but the original quota was 340,000, so the current number is only one-third of the quota.</p>
<h3>British Gold Shipped to the US in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[London, 22nd] Foreign reports indicate that a large amount of gold has been shipped to the United States. Yesterday, gold worth £20 million departed from a British port for New York. One mail ship carried £9 million. Continued shipments will take place today and early next week. This is related to the recent unrest in Europe. Within five weeks of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, Britain shipped £112 million worth of gold to the United States.</p>
<h3>Italy Building Airports in Albania and Appointing Governor-General</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, Albanian Capital, 22nd] "The Times" correspondent reports that Italy is conducting major military activities in Albania and is rushing to build multiple airports.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 23rd] The King of Italy has appointed former Minister to Albania Giacomoani as Governor-General of Albania.</p>
<h3>Germany Orders Newspapers to Engage in Written Warfare Against Democratic Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels ordered German newspapers to conduct as much propaganda as possible against the "lying democratic newspapers." Goebbels accused the democratic newspapers of "driving the world towards war." This major propaganda campaign will be particularly directed at Britain. German newspapers have expressed a desire for democratic countries to inspect their newspapers. The purpose of this official propaganda is clearly to support Hitler's response to US President Roosevelt's statement that all countries in the world feel threatened by Germany.</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit London and Meet with Stanley Today; Britain Decides to Extend Credit Loan to Romania</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Beijing, 23rd] The Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister hosted a luncheon yesterday for Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu. The Belgian Minister of Economy and the Romanian Ambassador to Beijing were also present. After visiting Beijing, the Romanian Foreign Minister will go to London on Saturday night.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 23rd] "The Sunday Times" foreign affairs correspondent here commented on Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's visit to London and predicted the outcome of the Anglo-Romanian negotiations, saying that he believes that the British government does not want to turn the guarantee to Romania into a mutual aid agreement, as with Poland. However, it can be asserted that the two countries will take the opportunity to discuss economic promotion matters. In addition, the Romanian Foreign Minister will have his first meeting with Trade Minister Stanley on Monday. It is also said that the British government is determined to assist Romania by granting it a credit loan of £2.5 million.</p>
<p>Germany Urges Implementation of the German-Romanian Agreement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 23rd] The British trade delegation is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow, while the German side is now trying to implement the recently signed German-Romanian economic agreement as soon as possible. Therefore, government authorities and merchants are in a dilemma. Ursache, who previously presided over the negotiations with the German side, has returned here. Accompanying him are two groups of German business representatives, fifteen in each group. It has been announced that German highway experts will come here soon to study the possibility of building important strategic military highways. The first oil production area has been designated in accordance with the agreement and will be developed by German-Romanian companies. A Romanian trade delegation left here yesterday for Germany to study ways to promote trade between Romania and the former Czechoslovakia.</p>
<h3>Poland's Strong Attitude; Mobilization Measures Not Relaxed; Rumors that Germany Will Exert Pressure on Poland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] Poland's partial mobilization costs an average of £40,000 per day and has not been relaxed in the slightest. However, people generally hope to change their legal status as soon as possible. However, Polish people are not prepared for any concessions. At the same time, Polish Germans continue to be arrested for insulting the country. Estonian Army Commander Laidoner arrived here on Tuesday and held staff meetings with Polish military experts. He was originally scheduled to return to the group today, but has now been extended to next Monday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] People here have now begun to speculate on Hitler's speech on Friday, but there is no concrete establishment. However, it is generally believed that German-Polish relations are about to unfold. "The Times" Warsaw correspondent said that Hitler will put pressure on Poland, urging it not to join forces with the Western powers.</p>
<h3>Franco's Victory Parade to be Held in Mid-May; Miaja Goes to Mexico</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 22nd] Today, the authorities here announced that the victory parade will be held in Madrid on May 14th and 15th. General Franco will go to Madrid to participate on May 15th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that it is rumored that the general staffs of Germany, Italy, and other friendly countries intend to hold talks, and that the generals of Germany, Italy, and Spain plan to hold a military meeting in Berlin. The competent authorities here have not been able to confirm this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Burgos, 23rd] The authorities recently issued a statement saying that various rumors that foreign troops have landed in Spanish territory are all malicious rumors. Spain is determined to devote all its efforts to construction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Former Spanish Republican Army Commander General Miaja left here today on a British mail ship for Mexico City. French police escorted him to the border to prevent incidents from occurring during the journey.</p>
<h3>British and Soviet Cooperation: Today Provokes Resentment; Seeking Further Damage to British Interests in China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The "Asahi Shimbun" here reports that Japanese government and public circles, hearing that Britain is not only cooperating with the Soviet Union but also intends to extend the democratic front to the Far East, are "greatly angered." Therefore, Japan's attitude towards British interests in China must be reconsidered. The newspaper also stated that this indicates "British aid to communism in the Far East," and the Japanese government should seriously consider what countermeasures to take.</p>
<h3>Borah Comments: U.S. Neutrality; Roosevelt Agrees to Cotton Export Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Republican Senator Borah, yesterday, expressed his views on the Neutrality Act in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that American public opinion on the European situation is becoming increasingly strong, and that true neutrality is no longer possible today. Judging from past events, countries can no longer regard the United States as a neutral nation. However, Borah did not specify what he meant by "past events." Borah also stated that the American people do not necessarily need to care about the victory or defeat of the aggressor nation in the Sino-Japanese conflict, but in fact, the American people are extremely concerned about it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Senator Bankhead announced today that Roosevelt has agreed to the cotton export proposal, stipulating a subsidy of two cents per pound for 700 bales of this year's cotton production. This subsidy will be paid by the Department of Agriculture for a period of one year, starting from August 1, 1939. Exporters can receive cash subsidies or government cotton loan-pledged cotton. However, it is stipulated that the latter can only be sold after January 1, 1940. This new plan has gained the support of most of the southern cotton-producing group in the Senate and will be attached to the upcoming agricultural budget bill. Southern congressmen largely oppose President Roosevelt's original plan, fearing that cotton prices may be lowered as a result, forcing a large amount of new cotton to be stockpiled by the government.</p>
<h3>Soviet Fleet Holds Large-Scale Exercises in the Baltic Sea</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 23rd] The Soviet fleet began its spring large-scale exercises in the Baltic Sea yesterday.

No houses may be built within the designated area, indicating that the authorities intend to expand a new naval base there. Mezeikbi is west of Algiers, located on the Mediterranean coast, with a strategic position, only eighty miles from Tangier, across from Gibraltar.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Today, the French government re-issued a decree approving credit loans of nearly 20 million pounds sterling for defense expenditures.</p>
<h3>No War in Europe</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ping</p>
<p>The situation is developing faster and becoming clearer.</p>
<p>In September, ××××× gave the Sudetenland to Hitler. In November, Mussolini seized the opportunity to rise up, demanding Tunisia and Corsica from France. However, his old man's fate was far worse than his younger brother's, and his demands were naturally unsuccessful.</p>
<p>This year, in March 1939, while Mussolini was still chattering incessantly, Hitler reached out and took Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain just woke Hitler from his pipe dream—actually, only half-awake—issued a declaration of aid to Poland, and prepared to start organizing an anti-aggression front. Mussolini, however, had a stroke of luck and quickly grabbed Albania.</p>
<p>The history of aggression this year clearly shows that Germany and Italy are forever using a strategy of you attacking while I defend, mutually supporting each other. They have never openly proposed a joint front or made joint demands. Therefore, we say that the aggression of Germany and Italy is only 80% or 90%, not 100%. If they use 100% aggression, it would involve simultaneous attacks on all fronts, leaving no room for people to maneuver. The result would be war.</p>
<p>The famous political commentator Herten, in his "The Fate of the Danube Countries," says that the Axis powers always use one policy: "To do everything in their power to avoid war, but to make the greatest effort to create an atmosphere of war, to intimidate, and to deceive countries prone to war."</p>
<p>We agree with Herten. This time, Germany and Italy are still only creating an atmosphere of war and have no intention of a real war. Moreover, they fear a real war.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>The attitude of the Axis powers toward war is already clear. Now, let's see how the democratic countries are doing.</p>
<p>To put it nicely, Britain, France, and the United States are countries that love peace and firmly believe in the collective security system. Naturally, they hate war and have no intention of stirring up trouble.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, these countries, since 1918, in the Palace of Versailles, took and divided arbitrarily as victors, gorged themselves, walked to extreme capitalism, and enjoyed themselves to the fullest. In these years, they are barely maintaining the status quo, afraid of falling behind, how dare they think of another cruel and destructive war.</p>
<p>We have said that the Axis powers fear war; now, we can unreservedly say that the democratic countries fear war even more. The toxic elements of war terror have penetrated every person in the democratic countries—whether they are people, officials, even soldiers, or journalists.</p>
<p>Because of this, Germany and Italy have been able to take advantage of their aggression. The most obvious thing we can see is: every time Hitler and Mussolini take action or make demands, why don't Britain and France take counter-actions or make some counter-demands?</p>
<p>When Italy's invasion of Albania began, British Prime Minister Baldwin seemed to speak out with righteousness—but this was just a superficial statement. In fact, it was still for Britain's own interests in the Mediterranean—France hurriedly presented the Laval-Hoare Pact to curry favor. In the end, Baldwin also turned a blind eye, and, in the midst of the chorus of "shameless" in the House of Commons, automatically discarded the notion of sanctions. Why? This was scared away by Mussolini's "war."</p>
<p>Following this, Hitler marched into the Rhineland. Obviously, France was the one taking the blow. At that time, the French government and public were indeed filled with righteous indignation, ready for a fight. But soon, the atmosphere changed completely, and the extreme right-wing Flandin was brought in to take charge, singing his pro-German tune to ease the tension between the two countries. What is this? This was also scared by Hitler's "war."</p>
<p>The Spanish affair is even clearer. Germany and Italy openly transferred troops and equipment, and have already "intervened" to a terrible extent. Britain and France insisted on organizing a "Non-Intervention Committee." As a result, the government forces finally collapsed under the exhaustion of ammunition and aid. Therefore, many people say that Franco's victory was not due to the power of Germany and Italy, but to the "non-intervention" of Britain and France. Why "not intervene"? Fear of trouble.</p>
<p>After this, it was even more Chamberlain's so-called world of realism. Germany's annexation of Austria. Of course, there was no need to speak out, just quickly change the Austrian embassy to the German embassy to show friendly intentions.</p>
<p>Then came the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia…. Daladier always followed Britain's lead, and Chamberlain was always "forbearance to avoid disrupting the overall plan," forbearance, forbearance, forbearance, as long as the mortal wound to the British Empire was not touched.</p>
<p>We are not saying that people like Chamberlain and Daladier do not understand the facts of Germany and Italy's long-term war. They understand very well, but they also understand that they themselves are more afraid of war than Germany and Italy. Although it is not the difference between ten steps and a hundred steps, it is still a step behind. I am just afraid that if they provoke those two devils, they will also stir things up willfully.</p>
<p>The above is a review of the past, all to prove that the democratic countries also fear war. Perhaps some people will say that although the past was like this, it is different now. Britain has made assurances to Poland, Greece, and other countries, and is preparing to resort to force.</p>
<p>However, we have different views on this. We do not deny that Britain and France have indeed changed to a more assertive attitude this time, and this is a good phenomenon. However, it is not accurate to say that Britain and France are determined to guarantee small countries and are prepared to resort to force.</p>
<p>For example, if two people are fighting, one side rolls up their sleeves and speaks harshly, it will not lead to a fight. When the other side also rolls up their sleeves and retaliates with harsh words, then the fight has to happen. Therefore, people who are afraid of a real fight, the one with the bigger guts will always prevail, because he will definitely roll up his sleeves first, making a fake fighting posture. The one with the smaller guts, seeing that a fight is imminent and things cannot be done, will have no choice but to lower his flag and admit defeat.</p>
<p>The relationship between democratic countries and the Axis powers is like this. Every time, it is Hitler or Mussolini, who has the bigger guts, who rolls up his sleeves first. Although Chamberlain knows that it is all just a fake show, he still dares not roll up his sleeves to confront them, because maybe it will lead to a situation where he has to ride a tiger, where he has no choice but to really fight.</p>
<p>Learn from your mistakes. Chamberlain has suffered too many losses, and finally, he has learned the lesson: "strike first is best." This anti-aggression declaration is his first sleeve rolling against Germany and Italy, ×××××××. The day before Chamberlain issued the declaration of aid to Poland, March 30th, Thursday, a British Foreign Office spokesman said: "The Polish Foreign Minister will arrive here next Monday, but the Prime Minister will not wait to meet with the Polish Foreign Minister, and plans to issue a declaration tomorrow to prevent aggressors from launching an attack at the end of the week."</p>
<p>Doesn't this make it very clear that Chamberlain knows that Germany and Italy dare not fight back, ××××××××× hand, ××××××, and is definitely not "determined to resort to force."</p>
<p>We do not hide the fact that Chamberlain is indeed on the upper hand this time. Hitler has rolled up his sleeves to take Danzig, but he didn't have time. To avoid a real war, he had to swallow this frustration.</p>
<p>The re-declaration of Britain and France did indeed scare the Axis powers a bit. But, did Chamberlain really win? Did he stop the aggression of the Axis powers? Far from it! We say that Chamberlain's declaration still will not deter the aggressors, because he has no determination to "resort to force" at all—the Axis powers are just being deceived by it.</p>
<p>Brief Comment</p>
<h3>Expanding the Spiritual Mobilization of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The National Spiritual Mobilization Movement is a movement to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence to ensure the success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction. It is a movement to expand the entire nation's support for the war of resistance and national reconstruction and to strive for national liberation. This movement will not be perfectly successful without the enthusiastic participation of tens of millions of overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese, since the Central Government promulgated the implementation outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization and the National Covenant, have been enthusiastically promoting them, which will not only have a significant effect on the motherland, but the overseas Chinese themselves can also gain greater sympathy and respect from international people. If our overseas Chinese can enthusiastically promote the spiritual mobilization movement, it can not only directly mobilize the power of overseas Chinese to aid the war of resistance and national reconstruction, but also smash the plots of ×good in the overseas Chinese, overcome pessimism and disappointment, eliminate the poisonous atmosphere of peace and compromise, and promote the great spirit of overseas Chinese in assisting the motherland's revolution and national salvation movement over the years. It is worthy of special attention to the motherland and the world.</p>
<p>Students in Hong Kong held an oath not long ago. The Eastern District Teachers' Association and the Chinese workers of the Peninsula Hotel have also held oaths to the National Covenant. In addition to expressing our admiration, we feel that the circle of opinion, which bears the responsibility of leading the people, should especially catch up quickly and hold a large-scale oath-taking ceremony including all news practitioners, so as to actively develop the ideological mobilization movement that supports the ×××××××× speech and action. Of course, we also hope that all agencies, groups, schools, factories, shops, and even men and women from all walks of life will catch up quickly!</p>
<p>Expanding the spiritual mobilization movement of overseas Chinese, of course, cannot be satisfied only by holding the National Covenant oath: but every overseas Chinese who considers himself to still have enthusiasm, still have backbone, still value personality, and still love the motherland must take participating in the National Covenant oath as the beginning of a glorious struggle, abide by the oath at any time and place, and then do his best to assist all ×× reconstruction specific work.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese who are fortunate to be outside the artillery fire and are broadly in foreign territory, the leaders and people of the motherland are calling us! International people are watching us!</p>
<h3>Congratulating the 5th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Land Administration Society held its 5th annual meeting on the 22nd of this month at the Eastern Sichuan Normal School.</p>
<p>I remember that during the period when the Jinmian War of Resistance was launched, the association made great efforts to amend the Land Law with the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People's land revolution. Unfortunately, the relevant authorities in various places failed to implement this consistently and effectively, which cannot but be considered a regret for the cause of national resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>At present, the War of Resistance has entered a new stage. In this stage, we must enhance the combat effectiveness of the front line, expand the guerrilla warfare in the future, and intensify the cultivation of new forces in the rear. All these depend on the mobilization, organization, and utilization of the broad masses of farmers. To effectively achieve total mobilization of farmers, we must first solve the central crux of the current farmer problem, namely, the land problem. The Land Administration Society's annual meeting is held this week. We hope that the land problem can be reasonably resolved in accordance with the basic principles of the Three Principles of the People's land revolution, so that in the rear we can obtain the active efforts to expand the purpose of the farmers' eyes and actively help the front line to intensify production work, and in the war zone and the occupied areas of the ×people, the reasonable solution of the land problem can help the faithful execution of the National Covenant and the perseverance and expansion of the anti- × anti-traitor and anti-puppet movement. The above is only in terms of wartime. Further, if we can obtain a suitable and fair solution to the land problem at present, we can lay a solid foundation for the construction of the ideal new China of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The Land Administration Society is holding a meeting at this time. We respectfully send our deep hope that it can follow the principle of "equalization of land rights" in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the principle of "implementing the land policy of the People's Livelihood" shown in President Chiang's training speech on the 22nd, and seek a suitable and fair solution to the current land problem, so that the vast farmers of China can automatically and actively participate in all undertakings of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We also hope that the circles of opinion and mass organizations in various places will share the hope and wish it to obtain the due success.</p>

<h3>Bandits Run Rampant, Robberies Occur Frequently; Police Strengthen Guarding Forces in the New Territories; Cooperate with Various Villages to Establish Voluntary Security Teams; Three Robberies Occurred in Wan Chai and Ping Shan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in South China, the order in the border area between China and Britain has been affected several times in the past few months due to the war. The opportunity for unlawful people to act has increased, resulting in frequent robbery cases in villages in the New Territories, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Sheung Shui, Fanling, Lok Ma Chau, San Tin, and other places. There are many gangs of thieves, carrying inspection tools and sharp weapons. Since the New Territories are secluded and residents are scattered, it is inevitable that the police force will not be able to take care of everything. Therefore, the bandit forces are rampant, which has never been seen before in the New Territories. The ghosts and monsters are difficult to arrest, and very few cases can be solved after they occur. The police and sacrificial authorities, in order to prevent the growth of banditry in the New Territories, in addition to strictly investigating the traces of thieves, recently summoned the gentry of various villages in the New Territories, requesting the people of each village to organize voluntary security teams to assist the police in preventing theft. The organization of the volunteer police team is to be responsible by the gentry of each village to convene strong men in the village to take turns patrolling and guarding. This method has been agreed to by the gentry of each village, and it will be established one after another in the short term, which will be of great help to the security of the New Territories.</p>
<p>Police personnel express their opinions on this matter. Superintendent of Police Criminal Investigation Department Shiuhutun expressed his opinion yesterday. According to Shiuhutun, before Guangzhou was captured, the security of the New Territories was cooperated with the Shenzhen police, so even if there were robbery cases, they could be solved quickly. However, since the outbreak of the war in South China, the Chinese police have been unable to cooperate as before. Therefore, the bandits who rob in the New Territories often escape into the Chinese border after the incident, making it difficult to arrest them. Shiuhutun also said that since the beginning of the year, a total of 38 armed robbery cases have occurred in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and 70% of them have been solved by the police. More than 50 cases have occurred in the New Territories (including pirate robbery cases), and only 5% have been solved by the police. The reason why it is difficult to solve robbery cases in the New Territories is that the victims often fail to tell the police the details of the robbery afterwards, so even if small suspected robbers are caught, they are often allowed to escape the law due to insufficient evidence. Secondly, the stray bullets and various military equipment left behind during the war on the border are often picked up by bandits. The number of robbery cases in the New Territories is also inevitable for one reason. Moreover, there are no street lights in the New Territories, and after nightfall, it is impossible to tell people apart. The bandits then took the opportunity to escape into the Chinese border with ease. If each village establishes a guard regiment and patrols the entrances and exits, the bandits will definitely not be able to escape in the dark.</p>
<p>Three robberies occurred again yesterday. Yesterday, three robberies occurred again in Hong Kong and the New Territories. The cases are as follows: 1. At about 3:00 a.m. yesterday, the owner of the Cai Chang Old Image Private Shop on Lockhart Road, Wan Chai, Jian Cai (59 years old), was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awakened by a strange noise. He caught a glimpse of four big men entering, holding sharp swords, frightening him. Jian was afraid of being harmed and had to pretend to obey and crouch in a corner. The thieves were about to point things out to search when, while they were rummaging through the boxes, Jian took advantage of the thieves' inattention and suddenly ran out into the street and shouted for a police whistle. When the thieves saw this, they were afraid that the police would arrive, so they hurriedly fled out the door. At this time, the police officers nearby rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and cooperated in the pursuit. Finally, one person was captured and sent back to the No. 2 Police Station for record and to investigate the three thieves who were still at large. Fortunately, the store suffered no losses. 2. A robbery occurred in Haowei Village, Ping Shan, at 3:00 a.m. yesterday. Two houses without numbered addresses were robbed one after another. One house was occupied by Chen Ying, 51 years old, and the other was occupied by Deng Chao, an old woman in her 70s, both of whom were engaged in farming. Although the thieves did not carry weapons when they robbed, the residents were old and weak and unable to resist. Clothes worth more than ten yuan were robbed from the two houses, and they left howling after they succeeded. 3. At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the second floor of 12 King Kwong Street, Happy Valley, Wan Chai, was suddenly robbed by three thieves armed with weapons. As a result, gold and silver jewelry worth about more than 300 yuan was robbed. The victim of the robbery was a young woman named Zheng Xiuying (27 years old). At about 3:00 p.m. that afternoon, she suddenly heard someone knocking on the door. Zheng immediately ordered the maid to open the door, but after the door was opened, she saw three people rush in one after another, pulled out guns and sharp weapons from their sides, and pointed them at the maid and Zheng, and tied them up. Then, one of the thieves monitored everyone, and then two people searched for about 20 minutes before leaving with the stolen goods. Checking the items, it was estimated that gold and silver jewelry, clothes, and cash worth about more than 340 yuan were lost.</p>

<h3>Eastern District Teachers Association Held a National Oath Yesterday; Central Committee Member Luo Yiqun Attended the Oath Ceremony and Delivered Encouragement; Peninsula Hotel Employees Also Took the Oath on the Same Day</h3>
<p>After the War of Resistance entered the second stage, our country's military and diplomatic affairs have gained an advantage. The central authorities, in order to make the national spirit more unified, have strictly implemented spiritual mobilization. Compatriots at home and abroad have responded enthusiastically and have held national oaths one after another. Various groups in Hong Kong have also risen in response and have held oaths one after another. Yesterday, the Eastern District Teachers Association and all the employees of the Peninsula Hotel followed suit. The details of the oaths in the two places are recorded below:</p>

After the ceremony was performed, the chairman gave an opening speech, followed by a speech by Luo Yiqun, the oath-taker. First, he elaborated on the situation of our country's war of resistance and the prospects of the nation, and then promoted the significance of spiritual mobilization. Finally, he expressed his deep hope for the education circles in Hong Kong, hoping that they would abide by the purpose of spiritual mobilization, discipline themselves and others. The atmosphere was very solemn throughout the session.</p>
<p>Peninsula Chinese Employees The National Spiritual Mobilization Promotion Committee of the Kowloon Peninsula Hotel held a National Spiritual Mobilization Oath Ceremony at the rooftop garden of the hotel at 3:00 p.m. on the 23rd. More than 100 Chinese employees of the hotel attended. Xu Jingxi, the superintendent of the hotel, presided over the oath ceremony.

<h3>The Amateur Social Club Donates and Burns Relief Bonds: A Collective Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Amateur Social Club, being the most vibrant amateur organization in Hong Kong, its social department, yesterday launched a special trip to the old battery. Over eighty people participated. After a picnic, the club's Amateur Drama Troupe gave a temporary street performance of the play "Put Down Your Whip." They also publicly burned the national relief bonds donated this period, with a face value of one hundred and forty-five dollars. It is said that the serial numbers and coupons of the burned bonds have been reported to the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Obscenity: Hong Kong and Kowloon Police Mobilize, Mass Arrest of Street Vendors of Western Paintings, Dozens of Painting Stalls in Wan Chai and Yau Ma Tei Arrested</h3>
<p>It is reported that in Hong Kong and various districts of the peninsula, there are often countless Western painting vendors setting up painting stalls on the streets, enticing men, women, the old, and the young to drop a penny into a box. Then, they can peep into the box through the small holes provided in the equipment to view various pictures. The painting vendors would then move the mechanism, and the pictures in the box would move in sequence, just like movies on a screen. The figures and landscapes are lifelike, so ordinary men, women, children, and lower-class people often flock to them. However, for the sake of competition, some vendors secretly insert nude paintings into the collections within the boxes, attracting viewers. Some of these nude paintings are extremely obscene, and their impact on public morals is enormous. Recently, the police authorities have become aware of this secret and first sent undercover investigators, who confirmed it was true. So, yesterday, more than a dozen plainclothes Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched in armored vans to arrest these Western painting vendors and escort them back to the police station for investigation. These Western painting vendors are most numerous in Wan Chai in Hong Kong and Yau Ma Tei across the harbor, totaling no less than forty or fifty stalls. Yesterday, all of them were arrested by the detectives. If obscene pictures are indeed found hidden in their boxes, they will be prosecuted and punished according to the law; otherwise, they will be warned and released.</p>
<h3>Vital Transportation Routes Inland and Overseas: Increasing Numbers Travel from Hong Kong to Vietnam and Then to the Mainland, Hong Kong Visa Office Has Issued Over Five Thousand Passports Recently, Ships Have Increased Sailings, but Passengers are Still Crowded</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of war in South China, transportation between Hong Kong and our country fundamentally shifted. After the occupation of Hainan by the ×, Beihai was threatened, and the route through Guangzhou Bay became impassable. Therefore, merchants and travelers wishing to go to Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan must take the route through Haiphong. At the same time, to facilitate the people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered its Hong Kong Visa Office to also handle passport issuance. However, the government is deeply concerned that × spies or traitors may take the route through Vietnam to infiltrate the mainland and ordered the Visa Office to secretly inquire about passport applicants and issue them cautiously. In addition, inspection stations were set up at the border between Vietnam and our country to strictly inspect travelers. While the government intends to prevent problems before they arise, travelers find it quite troublesome. However, according to recent investigations by reporters, the government has recently implemented improvements to the transit process, and the inspection stations have been ordered to be abolished. In the past month, the Visa Office has issued more than five thousand passports for travel to Vietnam. The number of ships sailing to Haiphong has increased from three to six or seven, and the number of sailings has increased, but passengers traveling to Haiphong are still extremely crowded. In addition to the public cabin berths, first and second-class berths must be booked one week in advance. The situation can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Fishermen in Blood and Tears</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Reflections on the Launching Ceremony of the Four Relief Fishing Boats Held Yesterday</p>
<p>We cannot imagine the comfort of "heaven"; nor can we imagine the pain of "hell." If you glimpse this fisherman's picture written in blood and tears, you will surely feel sorrow and sigh that there are such tragic things in the world!</p>
<p>There are a total of 70,000 fishermen in Hong Kong, scattered in fourteen areas within Hong Kong Island. The three famous fishing areas are Aberdeen, Shau Kei Wan, and Cheung Chau. These places on the water are the fishermen's homes, the fishermen's society, and the place where fishermen struggle with life.</p>
<p>Ignorance, stupidity, prostitution, gambling, opium, red pills, early marriage, and the auction of body and soul are the elements that constitute the lives of fishermen. Their cultural level is so low that at most three out of a hundred can write their own names. Society also looks down on them too much. When fishermen land, they are sure to be subjected to people's trampling and bullying. Because they lack knowledge and organization, they become objects of exploitation, which also makes them fall into a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>The year before last (the twenty-sixth year) on July 6, after the "September 2nd" typhoon disaster – the fishermen lost hundreds of thousands of dollars – the × people began bombing Chiwan, so the fishermen suffered even greater pain. From September 13th, they began burning our fishing boats and killing our fishermen in the Wanshan Islands. Up to now, a total of 10,920 fishermen have died at the hands of the × people. A total of 628 fishing boats were burned. Countless were injured and lost property. In addition, there are more than sixty fishing boats. A total of more than 1,600 fishermen have been taken away by the × people and become the lambs of the × people. They can increase production for the × people. They are familiar with the geography and can help the × people kill our own compatriots. It is said that they are now managed by the × people near the tiger's mouth. How heartbreaking this is!</p>
<p>If we do not quickly take precautions step by step, the future troubles will become more and more serious. The × people use the ignorance of the fishermen, and their appeasement policy is even more unrestrained. For example, they use ten dan of Taiwanese sugar to exchange for one dan of our rice, deceive us into buying our chicken eggs, and even rob while washing the fishing boats… there are endless examples.</p>
<p>Now, the unemployed and helpless fishermen urgently awaiting relief are everywhere.</p>
<p>Although the tragic situations of being burned, killed, and robbed emerge endlessly, in order to survive, they have no choice but to risk going out to sea to fish. Rather than complaining that fishermen lack understanding, it is better to complain that our organization is too lacking, and the relief work is still far from enough!</p>
<p>This serious problem that has been forgotten and neglected by people was not until last year, when Mr. He Xiangning, who had the masses in mind, appealed to overseas Chinese. The enthusiastic overseas Chinese in the Philippines generously donated 2,000 national currency dollars, and the enthusiastic overseas Chinese in Annam generously donated 496 Hong Kong dollars, totaling 1,576 Hong Kong dollars. Mr. He Xiangning sent it to Mr. Cai Chusheng, who transferred it to Mr. Xie Fensheng, the person in charge of the Fishermen's Association, to plan and carry out relief work for the fishermen.</p>
<p>After receiving the money, Mr. Xie built four new Chinese-style small fishing boats as a means of livelihood for unemployed fishermen. However, each boat can only accommodate four people, and at present, it can only slightly relieve sixteen people. After two months, other unemployed fishermen will use them again. This is naturally not a thorough and perfect solution, but it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>At noon yesterday, the ceremony of launching the four fishing boats was held at the Xiangdao Theater in Aberdeen. Old and decrepit old fisherwomen, bare-chested and dark-skinned fishermen, and students from the fishermen's charity school in naval uniforms, a large group of fishermen with no experience in gatherings, crowded the entire theater.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Xie reported, followed by a speech by Liu Haiping, a representative of the China Relief Association. Ms. Wang Ying, deputy head of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, was also invited to speak because she was attending the welcome meeting of women's organizations in Ap Lei Chau. A female soldier from the front line moved the innocent and simple fishermen.</p>
<p>After that, the procession went to Tin Wan to hold the launching ceremony of the fishing boats. Originally, Mr. He Xiangning, who was loved by the fishermen, was to preside over the launching ceremony. However, Mr. He was unable to attend due to mental discomfort, and requested an old fisherwoman, Ms. Lu Huang, to preside over the launching ceremony, which was also somewhat meaningful. In the "September 2nd" typhoon disaster in the past, she righteously and bravely rescued more than 300 fishermen, and was a typical fisherwoman who was "respected and esteemed" in the fishing village.</p>
<p>The small fishing boats were named "Sincerity," "Unity," "Self-Reliance," and "Renewal." Each boat had four oars, one mast, and one rudder, was eight zhang long and five chi wide, had a draft of three chi, was built by the Hehe Shipyard, and the raw materials used miscellaneous wood. Sails, cooking stoves, fishing gear, and fishing boats were added. The total cost of the four boats was 1,200 yuan. When the songs and trumpets were played together, the ribbons were cut, and the four boats sailed smoothly into the sea.</p>
<p>However, these four small fishing boats are only a temporary solution for sixteen fishermen. More thorough, more extensive, and more active relief and education work is still waiting for us to work hard to complete.</p>
<h3>Mainland Fish and Vegetables: The Supply Continues Uninterrupted, Macao Ships Brought Large Quantities Yesterday, Residents Do Not Have to Worry About Having No Fish to Eat</h3>
<p>According to news from Hong Kong's fish and vegetable businesses, the supply of some fish and vegetables decreased when Jiangmen fell, but now it has resumed. Hong Kong-Macao ships have been bringing large quantities of fish and vegetables for days. Yesterday, the Hong Kong-Macao ship Lujiang carried more than eighty dan, and other ships each carried dozens of dan. As a result, the market price of freshwater fish has also recovered. However, firewood sold at retail is only forty to fifty jin per dollar, which is still considered expensive, and the poor find it even more difficult. According to insiders, under the current supply and demand situation, the price of firewood should not be so high.</p>
<h3>China News College Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday, Chairman Xu Shiying Attended and Delivered Instructions, Formal Classes Start Tonight</h3>
<p>The China News College, organized by the Hong Kong Youth Journalists Association, held its opening ceremony at the Chinese Middle School yesterday (23rd) afternoon at 2 p.m. Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the College, guests Du Qizhang, Fang Yuyan, Huang Zufen, representatives of various schools, reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, faculty, students, etc., totaling more than a hundred people, gathered together, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. After the ceremony, Chairman Guo Butao delivered a speech, mainly saying that he was extremely happy that everyone had come so enthusiastically today. Speaking of this News College, it reminded him of the early years of the Republic of China, when the Beijing Press Association planned to establish a News University to train news technology talents, but it did not materialize due to some reasons. Later, Mr. Cai Yuanpei felt the urgent need for news technology talents, so he established a journalism department at Peking University. This was the beginning of training news academic talents. Later, Mr. Cheng Shewo founded the Journalism Training School in Beijing, and the results were remarkable. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the school was unfortunately destroyed by the × people. Now, the Youth Journalists Association has inherited the great responsibility of training news talents and established this college. He hoped that the students would all study hard and be able to stand on the news positions in the future and shoulder the sacred task of resisting the war and building the country. Then, Tan Siwen, the Dean of Academic Affairs of the College, reported on the preparation process of the College, the curriculum arrangement, group learning, etc., and also talked about the employment prospects of students after graduation. Then, Xu Shiying, the Chairman of the College, gave an instruction speech, saying that when he went to London in 1910, a friend once told him that there were only three kinds of people in the world who were most precious: first, judges; second, lawyers; and third, journalists. All of you students have today begun to step onto the ladder of the journalist's life, which is most respected by the world. He had two hopes for this: first, in terms of self-cultivation, he hoped to be able to practice the three words "Purity," "Prudence," and "Diligence" and move towards the following six goals: 1.

<h3>Eastern Goods: Surprisingly Selling Well in Hong Kong, Dumping at Low Prices Outperforming European and American Goods, The Import of Piece Goods Alone Has Increased Significantly Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>Hong Kong is a major transshipment port in the Far East. Businesses from various countries are competing and vying for the market, all trying their best to win. However, European and American goods, on the one hand, have long distances and high transportation costs, and on the other hand, have better materials and higher costs. Eastern products are completely the opposite. Therefore, although European and American goods can occupy a place in the Hong Kong market, they ultimately cannot compete with them. In addition, Eastern goods have always adopted a large-scale dumping policy, and Hong Kong is a tax-free port, which has created a great opportunity for cheap goods to seek low prices. According to the investigation of Hong Kong's import goods, the quantity of goods in March last year was small, but the value was high. In March this year, the quantity of goods was large, but the value decreased sharply. The biggest reason is probably that Eastern goods have suddenly become active in the Hong Kong market. According to the investigation, the total import of piece goods in March this year was 6,864,348 yuan, while in the same month last year it was 8,872,490 yuan. Comparing the two, the import volume is more than last year, but the value is less than last year. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>(March last year) (March this year)</p>
<p>Cotton cloth 5.629.290 yards 8.668.130 yards</p>
<p>Suit material 30.594 yards 41.227 yards</p>
<p>Cotton silk cloth 2.017 yards 11.412 yards</p>
<p>Silk hair 252 dan 547 dan</p>
<p>Rayon 68.628 yards 787.08 yards</p>
<h3>Hong Kong News in Brief</h3>

<h3>Aberdeen Scenery Line</h3>
<p>— Cai Huisheng</p>
<p>Aberdeen - a small market located behind the peak of Gough Hill, in the Aberdeen harbor, a tributary of the East Lamma Channel. It is surrounded by many lush and continuous mountains; and across a narrow strip of water, the remotely facing Ap Lei Chau is also a small market. However, due to the steepness of the peaks and the narrowness of the plains, the market has no way to expand, and the transportation to and from Hong Kong is more inconvenient, so it is naturally not as "prosperous" as Aberdeen. This is one of the three major fishing areas in Hong Kong. There are dozens of kinds of fishing boats of various sizes that come to dock frequently in the harbor. Whenever it is the end of the old lunar year or the beginning of the year, or festivals and some "god's birthdays," all the fishing boats will come back from the sea by appointment, lined up neatly in rows. The prows and sterns face each other, stretching endlessly, making the mountains and seas an infinite spectacle. Overlooking the small boats shuttling back and forth in the "sea market" from the peaks, and then seeing the sails floating on the sea, the flying sand birds from the mountain gorges, if this is not a world of "brigands," then it should be enough for poets to "intoxicate" themselves.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the "July 7th" national freedom and liberation war, the bloody hands of the × people have reached into the South China Sea, and the fishing boats in Hong Kong and along the coast of South China have been constantly bombarded and burned by the × ships × kill, ×××× – this phenomenon has continued to this day and is still intensifying. As a result, many fishing boats do not dare to go to sea, and most of them lie dormant in the harbor for a long time, spending their bleak and miserable years; however, they cannot but live like everyone else, and the money they owe in high-interest loans does not allow you not to repay. They cannot catch fish near the coast, so they have to risk their lives and go to the boundless sea and sky without any guarantee. The outcome is naturally unnecessary to say!</p>
<p>The "shore people" of Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau - those "shore people" who are said to look down on the "water people," their business relies 99% on the support of the "water people" - fishermen who are looked down upon. Since the "water people" who are looked down upon have been subjected to massacre and arson, the business of the "shore people" who look down on them has also been greatly affected. However, there is a distorted status quo here, that is, since the War of Resistance, the houses in Hong Kong and Kowloon have been completely rented out, so some refugees who cannot find a place to live have turned to this place that is not much noticed by people. As a result, the population has increased sharply. However, there are not many houses here, and even fewer empty houses, but people's needs are very urgent, so the owners took advantage of this opportunity to make a "windfall" by taking advantage of the fire - greatly raising the rent. Until now, every house here is filled with people like canned sardines; those that can be used for business generally share a shop with two or three different businesses. Also, those simple and narrow houses that were never noticed before the war have also been re-registered and decorated, and businesses have started on the grassland, leaning over and bending down. This crowded situation is really no less than that of the main part of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The means of maintaining ferry transportation between here and Ap Lei Chau is a kind of exquisite ferry boat, with a dome-shaped blue or green awning on the top of the boat, and a flower mat laid in the middle of the boat for passengers to rest. In the small cabin, there are wooden shelves set up on the walls where things can be displayed, and the shelves are covered with pleasing embroidered cloth cushions and some rather exquisite tea sets, clocks, mirrors, and other utensils. When the boat moves, it sways left and right and moves forward, which makes passengers feel like they are sitting in a cradle. These "sampans" are the tools for "sampan girls" or "sampan women" to make a living. In addition to using them to carry passengers and earn a little profit, they are sometimes hired by people who are not very wealthy to "cruise the river."</p>
<p>Another kind of larger boat is more luxuriously decorated. A large "safety lamp" hangs in the cabin, and many beads are suspended. The walls of the cabin are full of painted mirrors or "sampan girls" "glam shots". The shelves are full of cups, plates, flower arrangements, and other things. This kind of boat is specially for people to "play." Whenever the night is clear and the wind is gentle, some lechers or "drug buddies" go to this boat to "cruise the river" - in fact, they sit without cruising, or lie down without cruising. These sampan girls are the wives and daughters of fishermen struggling on the line of death. Because they cannot survive, they have fallen to doing this inhuman act. For the sake of the whipping of survival, they have to put on powder and rouge to conceal their original "ugly" appearance and become a "braided" person like the "shore people". They are good at singing a kind of song unique to fishermen - a tactful, lingering, and pleasant flirtatious "saltwater song." Although the content of the song is not commendable, the sad and melancholic tone is enough to represent their hard work, and should make those who have the heart hear it and feel sad and tearful!</p>
<p>The specialty here - "fresh seafood" has always been praised by people. The business of several restaurants that specialize in "fresh seafood" is very bad; on Sundays and other holidays, they are even more crowded and there is no empty seat. The fish sold are all kept alive in the sea, and they are only caught and boiled alive when customers want them - this is what is called "fresh". The price of "fresh seafood" is very expensive. On average, fish that costs two or three dollars has to cost you ten or eight dollars. However, no matter how hard the restaurants try to make a profit, the "wealthy people" who eat fish naturally do not care about this point. Maybe they think that this is the only way to show "wealth"!</p>
<p>Someone once said this: "Going to Hong Kong without going to Aberdeen to eat seafood is not considered fashionable." It is probably the meaning that people with too much money are too unreasonable if they do not become "suckers" a few times.</p>
<p>With the turmoil in the European situation, Aberdeen has made many defense works, and according to reports in the newspapers, the Hong Kong government intends to turn this place into a military port because of its high mountains and deep water, which is a natural typhoon shelter - driving all the fishing boats to Wong Chuk Hang. If it is implemented, what the situation in Aberdeen will be tomorrow is not something we can imagine.</p>

<h3>Utter Helplessness – Offensives on Both Northeast Lines Exhausted – Our Cross-River Raids and Attacks Repeatedly Successful – Our Army's Counterattack at Zhongxin Market Quite Successful</h3>
<p>[Correspondent from Wengyuan] On the front lines of Northeastern Guangdong, utter helplessness reigns. Most battle lines have shifted from offensive to defensive. Regarding recent combat situations, a reporter obtained information from local military authorities yesterday, listed as follows:</p>
<p>Zengcheng Troops Cross the River to Attack – Since relocating to new positions, our Zengcheng forces have engaged the enemy in a stalemate along the Zengcong Gongfu-Cong Highway and other areas, continuing to advance fiercely towards Guangzhou. Our forces holding the Lizhi'ao area north of Zengcheng, in coordination with the Third Guerrilla Force, crossed the Zeng River along the Zengbo Highway on the morning of the 21st to launch an attack, making contact with the enemy's outposts, followed by intense fighting. Another unit of our forces attacked both the Zengbo and Dajiang areas, disrupting the enemy's communication. Our army launched a major campaign to annihilate the enemy, achieving numerous kills. Currently, the enemy in Zengcheng is under great threat and shows signs of retreat.</p>
<p>The Enemy Attempts to Invade Eastward – Futian Position – On the 21st, according to the Zengcheng military intelligence, the enemy forces, attempting to contain the rear of our Eastern Route Army, dispatched over two hundred cavalry and artillerymen and four hundred infantrymen to invade the Futian and Luofushan positions in Boluo. The enemy used small-caliber cannons and tanks for cover, advancing fiercely. Our defending troops at the foot of Luofushan calmly responded, using flat-trajectory guns to suppress the enemy's tank forces. Subsequently, fierce battles broke out in areas such as Bogong'ao and Jigongkeng in Futian. Our brave teams annihilated the enemy, one against a hundred, fighting intensely for three hours. The enemy's momentum slightly waned, and we took the opportunity to counterattack. The enemy fled in disarray towards Zengcheng. In this battle, both sides suffered casualties. Our army is now pursuing and pushing towards Zengcheng along multiple routes.</p>
<p>Huang Tao's Division Attacks Zhongxin – The advance units of the XXX division, led by Huang Tao, have repeatedly frustrated the enemy forces attempting to invade north from Taipingchang in recent days, inflicting heavy losses. Therefore, the enemy has been cautious and inactive lately. Huang Tao's troops from the Fuhexu headquarters, in order to cut off the enemy's connection from Zengcheng, launched fierce attacks on Zhongxin Market on the 20th and 21st. The enemy, caught by surprise, fought back hastily, but was on the verge of collapse. They urgently received reinforcements from Zhucun, resisting our army stubbornly, but to no avail. Our teams stormed the enemy's positions, charging and maneuvering, killing many enemy soldiers. Currently, our troops are still fiercely fighting the enemy on the Fucong Highway near Zhongxin, and are preparing to join forces with our troops in Liangtian to launch a counterattack downwards towards Danqiu Market and Zhucun, and other places.</p>
<h3>Victory News from the North – Our Army's Southern Advance Smooth – The Enemy at Longkou Being Encircled and Annihilated – Fierce Fighting Still Occurring in the Suburbs of Fengyong</h3>
<p>[Express News from Northern Guangdong] In the past ten days, the center of gravity of the war in Northern Guangdong has been on the left, actually in Zengcheng and Conghua. Recently, the enemy has devoted all its efforts to recapture Paitan and Zengcheng. In the fierce battles near Paitan in recent days, no less than two thousand enemy soldiers have been annihilated, inflicting heavy losses. Unexpectedly, the enemy has again moved troops along the Guangdong Road and the Guanghua Highway, attempting to invade the Xinjie position in Huaxian again. Our frontline troops of the Twelfth Army Group have received orders from the military authorities to stand firm. Currently, our Northern Route Army is counterattacking the enemy and making good progress. The most recent military intelligence is as follows:</p>
<p>Counterattack on Longkou – Annihilate Many Enemy Soldiers – After our Northern Guangdong forces recaptured Huaxian, they immediately began setting up strong defensive positions to prevent the enemy from invading again. On one hand, they dispatched troops to pursue the fleeing enemy. In recent days, our army has been pressing south along the Guanghua Line, through Lianglong Pingshan, towards the enemy positions in the Longkou Village and Zhucun area. On the evening of the 20th, our Kong Division, in coordination with a mechanized unit of the Central Government, launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Longkou Village. The enemy resisted stubbornly, relying on fortifications. Our army was exceptionally brave, charging and killing the enemy. Subsequently, our army from the Xinjie area also sent troops to assist, attacking the enemy from the side and engaging in fierce fighting. The battle lasted until dawn. The enemy's momentum was exhausted, and we took the opportunity to launch an assault, killing many enemy soldiers. Currently, the enemy is still stubbornly holding on to dangerous positions. Our army is in the process of encircling and annihilating them.</p>
<p>Invading Xinjie Again – The Enemy Suffers Defeat – Since we recaptured Xinjie, the enemy has repeatedly attempted to invade. On the 16th, they gathered over a thousand infantrymen to attack, but were repelled by our forces. In recent days, reinforcements have been transferred from Guangzhou and stationed in the Jiangcun and Gaotang areas. Since the 18th, the enemy's transportation along the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has been quite busy. On the morning of the 21st, the enemy from Jiangcun dispatched several hundred infantrymen and cavalrymen, along with two artillery units, northward along the railway, with the intention of invading Xinjie again. Our defending troops received the report and stood ready. Soon after, the enemy's advance units arrived at the XX position several miles south of Xinjie. Our army rose to meet them in battle. The enemy launched a fierce artillery barrage, using it to cover the infantry and cavalry charge. We calmly responded, and our position remained unshaken. At noon, we waited for the enemy's momentum to weaken slightly, and then launched a sudden and fierce attack, killing over ten enemy soldiers. The enemy could not withstand the assault and retreated south in defeat, abandoning many military supplies along the way. We have already conducted a search and advanced forward.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Still Occurring in the Suburbs of Fengyong – Furthermore, it has been investigated that on the 17th, 18th, and 19th, our army's counterattack on Fengyong was extremely successful. On the 18th, we successively recaptured important surrounding points such as Xianggang and Hulugang near Fengyong, encircling the enemy in Fengyong on all sides. In the past two days, our army has continued to launch surprise attacks on the enemy. In order to contain our army's advance, the enemy has occasionally shelled our positions in Hulugang and Xianggang. Our artillery also did not show weakness, returning fire. On the morning of the 20th, our artillery battles were very intense, and our Li Division's assault team also took the opportunity to launch an assault on the enemy, engaging in an encounter battle with the enemy in the suburbs of Fengyong. The fighting continued into the late afternoon.</p>
<h3>The West River Guerrilla Force is Active – The Guangxi Army Annihilates Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers in a Night Attack – Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Baini and Dengkeng to Vent Frustration – Deng Yanhua's Hometown Almost Completely Reduced to Rubble</h3>
<p>[Express News from the West River] After our Western Route Army began its counteroffensive, our guerrilla teams in the Baini area in the lower reaches of the West River have been very active, repeatedly annihilating stubborn enemy forces, greatly assisting the progress of the regular army.</p>
<p>Annihilating Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers at Yelong Ganggen – It has been investigated that Ganggen is the left flank of the Erfangshui enemy forces. Since our army began its counteroffensive on the 5th of this month, in order to prevent our army from crossing the river at Jinli and cutting off their retreat, the enemy increased their troop strength to over six hundred men, distributed in the villages around Ganggen. However, they were apprehensive, only daring to come out at night. A certain unit of our Guangxi Army on the south bank of the West River secretly crossed the West River on the tenth, disguised as civilians, and infiltrated Baini, coordinating with the local guerrilla force. At about one o'clock in the morning of the 16th, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy in Ganggen. When they arrived, the moonlight was dim and everything was silent. Our army, guided by the guerrilla force, stealthily passed through the enemy's sentry posts via small paths. With a secret signal, they charged into the enemy's camp, using hand grenades to bombard the enemy fiercely. The enemy soldiers were caught by surprise, panicked and disoriented in the darkness, unable to resist. Our army charged and maneuvered wildly for about forty or fifty minutes before safely withdrawing. This night attack was very effective, killing or wounding over a hundred enemy soldiers, seizing over ten firearms, and achieving a great victory.</p>
<p>Baini Dengkeng Suffers Indiscriminate Bombing – Furthermore, it has been investigated that after the enemy forces suffered a surprise attack by our army, they became enraged. On the 17th, they dispatched six aircraft from Hekou to indiscriminately bomb the villages near Baini, dropping a total of forty bombs. At that time, the villagers fled in panic. Unexpectedly, the enemy aircraft flew low and strafed with machine guns. Subsequent investigation revealed that the most bombed areas were the Baini Market and Dengkeng Village, with no less than twenty bombs dropped in each location. Dengkeng Village was almost completely reduced to rubble, while the Baini Market had dozens of shops destroyed and part of the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall destroyed, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties, both men and women, and causing an unprecedented tragedy. It has been investigated that Dengkeng Village is the hometown of Deng Yanhua, the former First Deputy Administrative Inspector, so the enemy's hatred is particularly deep. They had previously sent troops to harass the area several times.</p>
<h3>Another Bloody Account – Details of the Enemy Aircraft's Indiscriminate Bombing of Boluo – Dozens of Bombs Dropped – Over a Hundred Casualties</h3>
<p>[Express News from Huiyang] The enemy army in the East River, in order to disrupt our army's rear as our counterattacking forces press forward step by step, has been wantonly dispatching aircraft to wreak havoc in Dongbao, Huizhou, Boluo, and other places in recent days. On the 18th, enemy aircraft again bombed Boluo madly. The details are recorded below. It has been investigated that at 4:10 PM on the 18th, four enemy aircraft flew in batches over Boluo County from Zengcheng and Longmen, circling several times before flying low and taking turns dropping a huge number of bombs, over forty in total, and then flying south. Subsequent investigation revealed that six bombs were dropped in Lower Street in the city, over ten bombs were dropped at the Nanmen ferry terminal, three bombs were dropped at the County Government, and over ten bombs were dropped inside Nanmen, resulting in over a hundred civilian casualties, both men and women, and destroying over forty buildings, causing an extremely tragic disaster. After the enemy aircraft wreaked havoc in Boluo City, they dropped two bombs at the Qingtang Market in Boluo County during their retreat and strafed the civilians with machine guns from low altitude, also destroying several civilian houses and resulting in ninety-six casualties. County Magistrate Huang Zhongyu immediately dispatched personnel to take in and treat the injured civilians, and to collect and bury the deceased, but the disaster was so extensive that it had not been fully cleaned up by the 20th.</p>
<p>Organize Relief Teams and Reception Stations – The association believes that the relief work in various counties has rarely dispatched more personnel to work in the war zones due to funding constraints, which is not a close approach to the refugees. Therefore, it has decided to organize ten relief teams, equipped with all necessary items, to be dispatched to various war zones at any time to provide practical relief. The organization is currently being accelerated and will be established soon. Furthermore, in order to enable the universal reception of refugees in various counties, in addition to ordering Gu County to set up refugee reception centers as originally planned and to appoint local district and township chiefs as administrators, it is specifically stipulated that each county in the war zone and neighboring war zones should establish reception stations along the refugees' routes, generally setting up one station every ten to thirty li, and assigning the local Baojia chiefs to be responsible for receiving and transferring refugees to the county's relief association for resettlement.</p>
<p>Handling Measures for Refugees in War Zones – Furthermore, it is easy for both good and bad people to mingle in refugee areas in war zones. Therefore, the management of refugees in war zones must be strict. Specific measures for handling refugees in war zones have been drafted, on the one hand, to prevent bad elements from mixing in, and on the other hand, to quickly transport refugees away from the front lines to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. These measures have been drafted by the Relief Association and will be implemented after being submitted to the Provincial Government for review. The content stipulates that each county's relief association must send personnel to inspect the refugee situation in various districts at any time. If they can be transported to the rear reception center immediately, they must be transported immediately. Otherwise, they must investigate and register the refugee's name, hometown, age, etc., and fill it in the inspectors' manuals for constant attention. Female and child refugees, regardless of whether the front line is approaching or not, must be forcibly evacuated. The relief team responsible for the area will assess the situation and divide the team members into several groups, requisitioning cattle carts and wheelbarrows and other means of transportation to transport the elderly, weak, women, and children. Extreme attention is also paid to the protection of refugees. The association has already consulted with the Provincial Government and the military authorities, ordering the defense forces in the war zone and neighboring war zones to station troops along the route at any time, and ordering the county magistrates to instruct the district and township chiefs to dispatch teams to assist along the refugees' routes to provide practical protection and not to make things difficult for them on any pretext.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Relief Association Intensifies Refugee Relief Work Actively Promotes All Relief Efforts Relief Teams Enter War Zones</h3>
<p>[Express News from Shaoguan] Provincial Government Chairman and Relief Association Director Li Hanhun believes that refugee relief work is a major political priority at present. Although there was an organization for refugee relief in this province before, the organization of branch associations in various counties was not perfect. Therefore, he submitted a request to the Central Government to reorganize the association into the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association. It has now been reorganized and established, actively promoting all relief efforts and carrying out the reorganization of refugee branch associations in various counties. The reorganization situation and various measures are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reorganize Refugee Branch Associations in Various Counties – After the Refugee Relief Committee of this province reorganized the Relief Associations, Director Li Hanhun, who also served as the Director of the Association, believed that the refugee relief branch associations in various counties should also be reorganized at the same time to facilitate command. Regarding the reorganization process, the Provincial Relief Association has drafted organizational regulations for each county and city, ordering each county and city to reorganize and report on the establishment within a specified period, and in order to save expenses, the staff of each county association must still hold concurrent positions without additional pay. However, in areas in or adjacent to war zones where relief work is busy, full-time personnel may be appointed to facilitate the work. It has been investigated that more than twenty counties have complied with the order to reorganize and establish refugee branch associations, while the remaining counties have not been reorganized or are in the process of doing so. The Provincial Relief Association uniformly set a deadline of May 1 for all counties to reorganize and establish refugee branch associations and continue to promote relief work.</p>
<h3>In Shaoguan</h3>
<p>— Microwave</p>
<p>In the darkness, sitting in the car, like death, we swept past Nanhua Temple, crossed the beautiful Qujiang Bridge, and drove to the North Gate Station. Only then did the two-day journey come to an end.</p>
<p>Originally planned to visit Nanhua, but was delayed en route, delaying the time. When the car passed, it was already as dark as ink, and I could not get a glimpse of the scenic spot, which is a real regret. "Love and hate are impermanent, separation and reunion are scheduled." Traveling and sightseeing also have their predestined relationships. This is really hard to understand. Generally speaking, life must have curves and undulations to be considered meaningful.</p>
<p>Shaoguan—the new "Guangzhou City"—is the seat of the provincial government and the political center of Guangdong. In this place where government orders are issued, the rapid increase in population is inevitable. With the population increasing greatly, housing has become a problem, and the inns are overcrowded. Many people live on boats and live a floating life. I also tasted it for one night, but it felt a bit unpleasant, so I moved immediately. Naturally, the streets are much more prosperous than before, with tea houses and restaurants making a hundred times more profit, and there seems to be an inability to supply the demand.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of geographical and environmental factors, air raid alarms are very frequent. The crazy Japanese planes also came to spread their poison several times. The citizens have been alerted so often that they have strengthened their determination and confidence in winning the war of resistance. Since air raid alarms have become commonplace, everyone is very experienced. At the sound of the alarm, they settle their belongings and run to a safe place, without feeling flustered at all.</p>
<p>Shaoguan's air defense intelligence network is well done. For the convenience of the citizens, many report signs are hung in the city streets. The number and whereabouts of the Japanese planes are written clearly. I also experienced a "walking alarm" once and saw that all aspects were able to take responsibility and the order was very good. Chinese people rarely have the opportunity to exercise in the suburbs. This time, thanks to the invaders, everyone can take a walk every day, which is of great benefit to their health!</p>
<p>Like the families of nouveau riches, the poverty of the past cannot be concealed. Although Shaoguan has unexpectedly received good fortune, many places show that its strength is not enough to cope, especially the lack of goods, which will affect the progress of the cause and slow it down invisibly. Mr. Wu Jufang launched the organization of a cooperative, which is indeed a matter of urgent importance, and everyone hopes for its success.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Shaoguan, many friends complained to me, not about the lack of material food, but about the lack of spiritual food. Books and magazines are very, very few. Many things that need to be read daily cannot be bought. Newspapers are shipped from Hong Kong, and it takes at least a week to arrive at the fastest. People engaged in writing feel even more the lack of reference materials and sigh that it is difficult to write.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu established a book cooperative near the provincial government to supply the urgent needs of the environment, which has received good criticism from the outside world. Now, he has successively sent people to various places to collect books to enrich the content, aiming to cultivate it into a rich cultural warehouse.</p>
<p>Shaoguan was originally a very convenient place for transportation, with railways and highways extending in all directions, but because there are not enough means of transportation to be allocated, many have not received reasonable supply. There are also very few rickshaws in the urban area, and the fares are surprisingly expensive, at least two yuan. It is said that because the urban area is too small, there were not many rides in the past, so the fares were more expensive than elsewhere. Now there are few cars and many passengers, and there is no reason to reduce prices. Wartime traffic management is very important, and the adjustment of vehicles, the supervision of projects, and the allocation of personnel all require strict scientific management. Based on the actual situation I have seen along the way, I hope that the local authorities can pay special attention to it.</p>
<p>Movies and Dramas Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Sisters</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>"Sisters" has a mournful and beautiful story, which is more skillful than the so-called funny films that are noisy and amusing, and the so-called erotic films that are flirting and pretty.</p>
<p>The author is somewhat sighing at the scenery as before, but the faces are no longer the same. He uses the Nide family to go to the presidential election dance party and also ends with the presidential election dance party. The前後correspondence is handled very purely and skillfully, but it also makes people feel the feeling of the earth as a reverse journey and life as morning dew. The style of "white-haired palace maids are still there, sitting idly and talking about Emperor Xuanzong" certainly has its so-called haunting poetic meaning, but what it transmits to the audience is always a passive gray.</p>
<p>In fact, a story like "Sisters" can also be done if the director wants to emphasize its social significance, and it is very easy to do. For example, for Frank's encounters, write it from the front and emphasize it, but this is not the case now. The focus of the whole play is on Louise, and Frank only becomes a foil, and the joys and sorrows of her two sisters, Helen and Grace, only become a foil.</p>
<p>Putting the selling point on Louise is naturally determined by the director's worldview and outlook on life: he pays too much attention to human feelings and ignores society, not knowing that the starting point of human feelings is based on society.</p>
<p>Therefore, the interest that "Sisters" gives people is only leisurely and melancholy, and its social value is only limited to this.</p>
<p>If the wish to see a play is only to get a little helpless feeling of melancholy, then "Sisters" can be classified as a good one, especially the director can control this mood everywhere, for example,</p>
<p>(1) Louise and Frank's night escape, Helen and Grace's seeing them off at the ladder and window, on the desolate road, a carriage carrying a pair of lovers far away;</p>
<p>(2) After Frank lost his job, he hid it from Louise and went to be a sailor on the ship, at the moment of farewell before leaving Louise.</p>
<p>Others, the Nide family's preparation before going to the meeting, and the introduction of Louise and Frank's appearance, also have very good techniques, and the different ones before the two meetings, the guests and Louise's quick descent when she first heard Frank come to take the escalator, and the stumbling back from the boxing ring after the marriage, are all good contrast techniques. These techniques are concise and meaningful, but lack a little strength, and if the director is willing to spend some effort and add a little social value, it is not impossible to do. For example, Frank's loss of job to various newspapers to seek employment is very compact and powerful, and Frank's hearing that the San Francisco earthquake returned to the ship is not allowed, and turning to swim to the shore are several scenes, which are also much more powerful.</p>
<p>Erol Flynn plays Frank in this play, and his acting skills are not weak. We have seen his "General Blood" and "Robin Hood", thinking that he will only play roles that are brave and fighting. In this play, he is actually calm and skillful, and the handsome spirit in the martial arts film makes people feel the loveliness of a manly man. Bette Davis's Louise is not bad either. This big-eyed actress can convey her identity and emotions very well, that is, even the actress who plays the second sister Helen, Irene Louise, also has very good acting skills. Other supporting roles are also quite well-matched. After being tired of watching the funny and flirtatious movies, seeing such a movie with literary interest, although it is still too little content actively, it cannot but be said to be a movie that is worth watching.</p>

<h3>Happy Angel (9)</h3>
<p>She walked towards the window, and as she passed Harry, she really glanced at him. Harry was about to speak, but on her face, he couldn't find a trace of her remembering him. It seemed that her looking at him was only because she disliked his gaze on her. She walked to the window. "Ah! An airport," she suddenly exclaimed, "So many bombers!"</p>
<p>Just then, a horn was heard, and she quieted down. "What is this?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry," Donnell explained from the side, "I think it's for war."</p>
<p>"War?" she continued, "There won't be a war. Archer, there won't be a war, will there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, there won't be a war," Archer Weiber said calmly, with a strange smile on his lips, "They are all too well prepared."</p>
<p>"You..." Irene smiled happily, "They won't fight, they are too wary of each other. They will put on beautiful uniforms, strut about, and call themselves heroes, but they won't fight. Mr. Weiber also said so, he knows."</p>
<p>After they went to see the rooms, Harry asked Donnell, "Who is that?"</p>
<p>"That's a big shot from Europe, Mr. Archer Weiber."</p>
<p>"What about the woman?"</p>
<p>"I guess she's his wife."</p>
<p>"You can only 'guess'," Harry sat down at the piano and began to play a Russian song called "Evening Song."</p>
<p>The next day, after dinner, while sitting idly in the drawing room, Harry met her. She was sitting with a British couple who were on their honeymoon. Mr. Weiber was not present. Mr. Cheyne introduced them, and in the introduction, she had no other name than "Madam."</p>
<p>She talked about many places she had been to and the dangers she had encountered. Then, she asked Harry directly for the first time, "Mr. Fan, have you been to these places?"</p>
<p>"No, I have only performed in Omah," he stared intently at her face, "Madam, have you been to Omah too?"</p>
<p>"Omah? Where is that? Persia?"</p>
<p>"It's in America, in our own country."</p>
<p>At this moment, someone came to tell her that Mr. Weiber was asking her to come, and she excused herself and left. As soon as she left the room, a guest walked in with a newspaper. "Any news?" Mr. Cheyne asked seriously.</p>
<p>"The war has begun. If you want to know the real facts, go ask that big shot Mr. Weiber. He can give you all the war news because he created it. He organizes munitions factories all over the world. The people's desire for peace has been destroyed by people like Archer Weiber."</p>
<p>In Archer Weiber's sitting room, Irene stood facing the fireplace, with Weiber pacing back and forth behind her.</p>

<h3>Soccer Award Presentation Performance Match: South China Overwhelms Hong Kong League Select; Feng Jingxiang and Li Huitang Each Score Three Goals for Their Teams, Truly a Double Marvel; Second Division Match: South China Defeats League Select 2-1</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter's Special Dispatch] This year's soccer season has been extremely prosperous. From beginning to end, business has been booming. Yesterday's award presentation performance match also attracted tens of thousands of fans who went up the mountain to watch the game, creating a lively scene.</p>
<p>The wonderful performance was exciting, and the fans were overjoyed, cheering in unison. The South China brothers, winning the championship in one fell swoop, are truly talented. Yesterday, they overwhelmed the League Select team, fully displaying the colors of the champion.</p>
<p>There are many noteworthy things in the two matches. Let me tell you, don't mind the details: (1) In the second division match, in the second half, South China's seventh player had a problem with his feet. Many players were suffering from muscle cramps and pain. They were falling down and unable to form a team. However, they actually won 2-1. It was truly a miracle and also a stroke of luck. (2) The Hong Kong League Select team in the first division match, with center forward Li Huitang and goalkeeper Tan Junqian as partners, had never lost before. However, their record could not be maintained yesterday. They were finally broken by South China. Fortunately, they were broken by "their own people," which didn't matter much and even showed "our" skills. (3) South China's center forward Feng Jingxiang and Hong Kong League Select's center forward, the "Oriental Standard Ball Player," both performed a "hat trick" (meaning they both scored three goals). It is rare for such a coincidence to happen. (4) In the past, there were only first division award presentation performance matches, not second division matches. This time, it was specially added, and there were more spectators, setting a new record.</p>
<p>In a soccer match where the skills of the two sides are evenly matched, the winning side has its own reasons for winning, and the losing team also has its own problems. For example, yesterday, South China overwhelmed the Hong Kong League Select. The most obvious thing was that South China's team had coordination in their operations and cooperated extremely well in the front line, causing the Hong Kong League Select defenders to be unable to resist, thus determining the outcome. However, their front line had a dangerous person like Huitang, who broke through three barriers alone, which was still considered effective. However, "the music of Xia Chu and Fang Qing was played, and the drums of Yuyang frequently startled," and in the end, they lost more than they gained due to slightly inferior defense.</p>

<p>Jingxiang and Huitang were originally one family and were used to cooperating, but yesterday, they played for different teams, confronting each other. The performances of the two also had their own unique features. Jingxiang won by technique, being clever and active, while Huitang was unmatched in shooting, with powerful feet. Each had their own merits and could be called a double marvel. However, Jingxiang had the assistance of Chai Beihua, so their cooperation was effective. Huitang felt lonely and helpless without Jingxiang. Therefore, Jingxiang's "hat trick" was actually greatly helped by Beihua. As for Huitang, the three goals he scored relied more on his personal strength. It is great to have such achievements with little assistance.</p>
<p>Speaking of the performances of each player, on the South China side, only Li Enliang in the front line still lacked experience and seemed a little restrained. The others were excellent. The midfielder Guo Yingqi was the most refreshing and spicy, attracting attention. He was the smallest in stature but had the highest skills, truly proving that "you cannot judge a book by its cover." Liu Qingcai returned to his original position, providing a clear path for passes, which was much better than playing as a left forward. The two Li's in the inner defense had crisp footwork, especially Guo Wei, who repeatedly stopped Huitang's progress, which was praised by the audience. However, Huitang was still able to break through three barriers by taking advantage of gaps, showing that Huitang is not easily restrained.</p>
<p>On the Hong Kong League Select side, being able to score three goals showed that their offensive power was not weak. However, their defensive power was slightly reduced due to changes in several players, which was the basis for their defeat.</p>
<p>The dignitaries who came to watch the game yesterday included Auxiliary Police Secretary Smith, Police Commissioner and his wife, Sir Zhou Shoushen, and Chinese representatives Mr. and Mrs. Luo Wenjin, as well as you and me.</p>
<p>After the game, Auxiliary Police Secretary Smith, the president of the Football Association, gave a speech, praising the excellent results of this year's soccer season and commending all the soccer players. Then, Mrs. Luo Wenjin presented the championship prizes for the first, second, and third divisions. Finally, South China team captain Bao Jiaping presented flowers to Mrs. Luo, and they dispersed after shouting three cheers. The champions of the three divisions are named as follows:</p>
<p>First Division Champion: South China South (each player received a gold medal)</p>
<p>Second Division Champion: South China Zeng (each player received a silver medal)</p>
<p>Third Division Champion: Soldiers Team (each player received a good medal)</p>
<p>After the Second Division Champion South China team defeated the League Select team 3-1, the highly anticipated All-Hong Kong Elite Assembly was vividly presented. The new champion South China South lacked the "bomb" Liang Rongzhao, and transferred Qingcai to defend the center, with Liang Baiwei playing right forward in reverse. Li Zhaorong's foot was twisted in the right inner record, and the "Young General" Li Enliang filled in. Although the main figures of the Hong Kong League Select did not all appear, the high-stepping Da Gaoshanu also made an appearance, which excited the fans. However, the absence of midfielder Birodo, the mastermind, inevitably affected the combat effectiveness. (Soccer Field Tycoon)</p>

<h3>First Half Battle Situation</h3>
<p>The two teams faced each other, and the battle broke out. In the blink of an eye, Huitang was seen charging across the river, coming fiercely, but was eventually rejected by Yingqi. Douwen advanced along the side and encountered Rongsheng, also failing. You came and went, making the battle quite spectacular.</p>
<p>(Nine minutes) Huitang seized an opportunity to enter, launching a cold arrow from afar, as fast as a shooting star. Jiaping quickly intercepted and saved it, turning danger into safety. Jingxiang advanced and joined forces with Guangsen to force a corner kick. Although the kick was good, Jingxiang fired an over-the-mountain cannon. Then, Huitang came with another fierce shot, also missing the target.</p>
<p>(Seventeen minutes) Guangsen launched an offensive from the side, with Beihua supporting on the right. Jingxiang and Guangsen passed the ball to each other, like lions rolling a ball. Junqian was under the danger of the ball, his heart pounding, rushing forward to intercept and save. However, Jingxiang had already swept the shot first, the ball hitting the goal post and rebounding out. Junqian struggled to entangle, but Jingxiang followed up and gently pushed it, making it impossible for Junqian to recover. (1-0)</p>
<p>(Twenty-one minutes) Soon after, Jingxiang suddenly launched another cold arrow, its momentum very strong. However, Junqian was alert and quickly received it, preventing a disaster.</p>
<p>(Thirty-one minutes) Beihua passed quickly, Jingxiang followed up with a fierce shot, but it became a wild shot. On the other side, Huitang led the army to attack several times, but to no avail.</p>
<p>(Thirty-two minutes) Jingxiang crossed Xia Xian and shot a ground ball from a distance. Junqian's save was effective, turning hostility into friendship. The first half ended with South China South leading 1-0.</p>
<h3>Second Half Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Five minutes into the second half, Rongsheng committed a handball foul on the midfield line, and Yingqi was ordered to take the kick. Han Nibal headed the ball on the left side of the goal, but it was intercepted by Jingxiang, who shot and hit the target. (2-0)</p>
<p>(Five and a half minutes) After South China South scored another goal, the game was restarted in the center circle. Huitang suddenly advanced and launched a cold shot from about 20 yards from the goal. Jiaping was unaware of this and conceded a goal. 1-2, Hong Kong League Select scored a consolation goal.</p>
<p>(Twelve minutes) Douwen passed far to Guangsen, who headed the ball to Jingxiang. Jingxiang shot into the net without waiting for the ball to land, scoring a hat trick. (3-1)</p>
<p>(Twenty minutes) Douwen broke through and transported the ball. Junqian, as the defender, was unable to return in time and rushed out to save. Unexpectedly, Beihua arrived first and pushed the ball into the net. (4-1)</p>
<p>(Twenty-five minutes) Chengtou rushed forward and dodged Tiansheng, passing on the baseline. Gaoshanu received the pass from the side and cleverly passed it to Huitang. Huitang lived up to expectations and scored. (2-4)</p>
<p>(Thirty-four minutes) In the sound of the final whistle, South China South's offense was slightly slack, and Hong Kong League Select launched a rapid attack. Huitang received a pass from Li Anna and shot into the bullseye, also performing a "hat trick." In a 3-4 situation, Hong Kong League Select was defeated.</p>

<h3>Open Basketball Tournament: Two First Division Matches Tonight; Yesterday, Chuncao, Huaqiao, and Peiying Won</h3>
<p>The Open Men's Basketball Tournament held only three second division matches yesterday. In the first match, Chuncao played against Guanlei. The strength of the two teams was similar, and the game was quite exciting. During the game, Guanlei's coordination and interception skills were more agile than Chuncao's. Unfortunately, their shots in the first half were inaccurate and mostly failed. However, Chuncao was not willing to show weakness and often launched counterattacks. Kuang Zhanwen scored many shots, taking the lead with 18-14. In the second half, Chuncao's Zhanwen and Shixiang scored many points one after another. At this time, Guanlei also tried hard to counterattack, with Yu Jinbang and Bo Yu Kui returning the favor one after another. However, time was running out, and Chuncao defeated them again with 33-30 at the end of the game.</p>

<p>In the next match, Huaqiao played against Lingying. Huaqiao had strong strength, and their defense and offense were far above Lingying's. In the first half, although Lingying tried their best to resist, they still lagged behind 10-13. In the second half, Huaqiao's morale became even stronger. Wu Xu and Huang Jie successively scored points, and then Fu Qixiang scored again, creating an advantageous situation. Later, Jiang Shihan scored several times, but unfortunately, he was unable to turn the tide alone. As a result, Huaqiao won 39-25.</p>

<p>In the last match, Zhong Sheng played against Peiying. Both teams are strong teams in the race for promotion, with strong strength. They met on a narrow road yesterday, and the battle was extremely tense. The score was tied several times. At the end of the first half, Zhong Sheng led 16-15. The battle in the second half was even more intense. Peiying tried hard to counterattack and scored several times. However, Zhong Sheng was not willing to show weakness, and the points were quickly lost and regained. Peiying finally won 48-41 with the efforts of their soldiers.</p>

<h3>Today's Competition Schedule</h3>
<p>There will be two first division matches and one second division match tonight. In the first match, first division Guangda will play against Huanan. Judging from the strength of the two teams, although Huanan once lost to Xingdao, they are extremely strong. It will be difficult for Guangda to avoid defeat when facing their strength. In the second match, first division Xingdao will play against the Police. Xingdao is a strong team in this tournament, with many talented players. Although the Police are brave, their offense is not evenly distributed and they are unlikely to be a match for their opponent. In the final match, second division Huanan will play against Taikoo. Huanan's offensive power is strong, and they are likely to win.</p>

<h3>On Balancing Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>— Bao Ledi</p>
<p>(I) How to View This Problem</p>
<p>Although everyone now feels that prices are outrageously high, everyone believes that this is a phenomenon inherent to wartime. Indeed, this is the case, and it's the same both domestically and abroad. Everyone grits their teeth and endures this wartime reality, which reflects the entire nation's spirit of steadfast sacrifice, something to be proud of to the world.</p>
<p>However, we must not simply let things drift because we deem it inevitable. Because there are many who are taking advantage of this excuse to manipulate prices and deliberately inflate them. For the sake of the overall interests of the nation, everyone should steadfastly sacrifice everything. But in reality, we cannot deny that there is a limit to how much we can endure in terms of material life. At the same time, we must consider that when the lives of the people are so burdened by high prices that they cannot sustain themselves, it will not help the war effort.</p>
<p>Moreover, rather than saying, "There is an urgent need to resolve this issue," it would be better to say, "For the sake of future security, we must now take precautionary measures to prevent problems before they arise." Since the main reason for the current soaring prices is known to be related to the war, then as long as there is no hope of ending the war, and as long as all the reasons that stimulate soaring prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited price increases, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>(II) Analysis of the Reasons for High Prices</p>
<p>Why does the existence of war stimulate soaring prices? The reason is simple. Let's take the current situation as an example.</p>
<p>(1) Before the war, the country's expenses were at most only about 800 to 900 million yuan. The budget for the 26th year of the Republic [1937] set an unprecedented record, but it was still only a little over 1 billion yuan. But since the outbreak of the war, due to the rapid increase in military spending, it is said to have exceeded 2.5 billion yuan. This means that the demand for goods is almost more than double what it was in peacetime. When demand increases, prices naturally increase. Shanghai, for example, has also seen a sharp increase in population, which has greatly increased demand, but this is not a major factor. Because,</p>
<p>(2) If the increase in demand is accompanied by a proportional increase in production, then the rise in prices can still proceed along a curve and will not rise higher and higher. However, our production capacity was already so backward in peacetime, and it has been so damaged during the war that it is beyond recognition. Not only is the industrial equipment dilapidated, but also vast rural areas have abandoned farming in the war zones. In addition, the Japanese army's looting everywhere has further increased the consumption of materials and widened the gap between supply and demand.</p>
<p>(3) Domestic production has been greatly reduced or destroyed, plus the Japanese looting, so our country's export capacity has been greatly reduced. The reduction in exports affects the balance of international payments. In addition, our country's military and civilian needs are mostly supplied from overseas, so the value of the currency itself is threatened. Moreover, the Japanese are also trying their best to disrupt our country's foreign exchange. Since the emergence of the black market for foreign exchange, the value of the currency has fallen by about 60 to 70 percent. The fall in currency value will inevitably lead to a more drastic surge in the price of imported goods. Therefore, the currency burden on the government and the people for purchasing foreign goods is even greater, and the amount of currency circulating domestically naturally has to increase.</p>
<p>(4) When the amount of currency in circulation increases, if the circulation of goods is smooth, then the degree to which the currency stimulates prices can still be reduced by the increase in the transaction rate. However, the transportation lines in the war zone are all controlled by the Japanese. Even if relying on foreign merchants, freight transportation cannot meet the needs. Therefore, the situation of supply and demand imbalance is even more serious, and the force of price increases is even stronger.</p>
<p>(5) In the process of commodity circulation, in addition to the difficulty of freight transportation, there are many other obstacles. The Japanese puppets extort along the way in the war zones and are now promoting their so-called "trade control." In addition, the increase in freight, insurance, and domestic remittance rates are all strengthening the imbalance of supply and demand and the extent of price increases.</p>
<p>These many pressures that stimulate prices are all products of the war. As long as the war exists, then the possibility of rising prices will also exist. We can offset the pain of these high prices caused by the war with the harvest of the final victory. But in addition to these natural reasons, there are also phenomena such as speculation, manipulation, monopolies, and hoarding. Moreover, these phenomena have a more violent impact on prices. It is indeed impossible to calculate the position occupied by speculative prices in the price of various goods, but we can just give an example to prove the degree to which it occupies the current price level.</p>
<p>(III) Speculative Prices in the Price Level</p>
<p>For example, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the number of rice stored in warehouses in Shanghai did not actually decrease. In terms of the rice market season, this is the weakest period for rice prices throughout the year. But this time, it was contrary to the usual practice, and suddenly began to rise sharply. The reason for the soaring prices, it is said, was that the Japanese army was buying it, so there was a risk of a rice shortage in Shanghai. Everyone competed to hoard rice to prevent the famine. It is okay to purchase rice to prevent famine, but it is suspicious why the rice price stopped rising at the limit of fourteen yuan. If there is really a risk of rice shortage, even under strong control, there will be a black market, just like the black market during the rice shortage last year. Moreover, when the rice price rose to fourteen yuan, why didn't the Japanese army continue to buy it? If it is said that it is too expensive to buy, but the Japanese army does not pay according to the market price for anything they buy. Whether it is expensive or not is not related to whether they buy it. Later, it was heard that the rise in rice prices this time can be regarded as the "complaint" of Shanghai rice merchants, because now, except for the rice price, which is still the same as before the war, other prices have risen sharply.</p>
<p>One of the factors of the current high prices is the foreign exchange relationship. Rice prices are not affected by this, because they are local products. But cotton is also a local product, why can't it be as stable as rice prices? If it is for needs, then the need for cotton is not necessarily greater than that for rice. If it is said that it is because of the Japanese puppet control and harsh taxes, rice has also been treated the same. But now the market price of cotton has risen by more than 50% compared to the average price in the half year before the war. The rise in cotton prices is mostly caused by the soaring yarn prices, in addition to the actual reasons such as supply and demand. Looking at last year from January to October, yarn prices continued to rise, while cotton prices saw both rises and falls. Therefore, the average yarn price for the whole year last year rose by 32.3% compared with January to August of the 26th year of the Republic, while the cotton price fell by 2.1%. In January this year, the yarn price rose by 52.5% compared with the average price in the eight months before the war, and the cotton price also rose to 44.%. (See the Sixth Shanghai Table in the January issue of the Economic Statistics Monthly)</p>
<p>Why did yarn prices rise so sharply? Of course, it is related to the many reasons mentioned above, but the speculative component is even more related. Although many figures on the destruction of production equipment can be put forward from the reduction in production to prove it, Shanghai is, after all, the place where cotton yarn production is easiest to supply in total. There is no reason to make yarn prices rise sharply in circulation. Moreover, it is a domestic product and is not affected by currency. Shanghai yarn prices have always dominated the national yarn prices. If its price is indeed reasonable, then the inland demand price cannot be used to deliberately wait for a high price to sell. But now, because the inland yarn prices are extremely high, the Shanghai yarn prices are also raised in anticipation, so it has become the situation where the more it rises, the more expensive it becomes today. It should be known that using demand to wait for a high price to sell is one of the tricks of speculative manipulation.</p>
<p>We may as well compare it from the increase in price levels. The rise in prices in Shanghai is actually more severe than in the interior. For the sake of material limitations, let us compare July of the 26th year of the Republic and August of the 27th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Comparison of Price Indices in Shanghai and the Interior (Average Price for the Whole Year of 1937 as the Base Period)</p>
<p>July of the 26th Year of the Republic　August of the 27th Year of the Republic　Increase</p>
<p>Shanghai　97.4　127.6　33.2</p>
<p>Guangzhou　96.3　122.2　25.9</p>
<p>Chongqing　104.2　113.1　8.9</p>
<p>(Note) Shanghai and Guangzhou originally used 1926 as the base period, and were recalculated using the average for the whole year of 1937 as the base period, so as to compare with the Chongqing index using 1937 as the base period as above. The materials refer to the Chinese and Foreign Economic Yearbook published by the China National Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>Shanghai had already experienced the outbreak of war in the 26th year of the Republic. The other provinces of Guangdong and Sichuan were in the rear. Taking the average price for the whole year as the base period and comparing it with the prices afterwards, in principle, the increase rate should be lower than that in the interior. But the opposite is true. For example, the amount of Shanghai prices in August of the 27th year of the Republic, which has changed from the front line to the rear, has risen more sharply than in the interior. The reason that the high prices in the interior affect the prices in Shanghai is untenable, but it proves that the degree of speculation in Shanghai is far more severe than in other places. (End)</p>
<h3>The Course of China's Gold and Silver Policy</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>The following two potential benefits of these regulations for China's wartime finance are apparent:</p>
<p>First, the deepening of the legal currency [Fabi] among the people. Taking silver alone, since the implementation of the Fabi system, the silver collected by the government, excluding the original reserves of the various banks, totaled 222.5 million yuan by the end of June 1936. However, it is estimated that as a result of imports and exports over the years, there should be at least 700 million yuan of silver in the country. The minimum that can be concentrated should be 350 million yuan. Then, at least half of the silver in the country should still be scattered among the people. Now, the regulations stipulate that local silver firms and banks may purchase silver to be used as reserves for issuing currency, which makes the Fabi more widely available in poor and remote areas.</p>
<p>Second, the increase in overseas funds. The so-called overseas funds are the financial resources that can be used for international payments. Although all countries in the world have now stopped the gold standard, gold still retains the function of value storage in international payments. As for silver, although it does not have the same storage function as gold, under the Sino-US Monetary Agreement, China can easily exchange silver for gold. Now, through the use of this method, it will be easier to collect gold and silver from various places than relying solely on the Gold and Silver Collection Office to handle it, and rapidly increase overseas funds.</p>
<p>The progress of China's wartime gold and silver collection policy, as discussed in the second paragraph of this article, and the current implementation of the silver firms' gold and silver collection methods, show that the collection methods are becoming more diversified and the anti-fraud rules are becoming more stringent. It is commendable that this has progressed to such a point in just a year and a half. As for using gold and silver collection as a monetary policy in wartime financial policy, replacing the inflationary monetary policy, and using it in parallel with the mutually coordinated policies of taxes, rents, and public debt, this type of wartime financial policy is worth studying.</p>

<h3>The Question of "Atmosphere" in Literary Works</h3>
<p>— Yu Hua</p>
<p>What the soldiers at the current stage need is spiritual food, and their heads also need to be armed. Slogans alone, simple works that only shout until the throat is hoarse, already belong to yesterday.</p>
<p>Our advanced writers have deeply felt this point, and have all begun to walk towards the path of "popularizing and improving." That is an excellent phenomenon that follows the war.</p>
<p>Recently, readers everywhere, even the brave soldiers in the trenches, have gradually developed a warm love for literary works. They compete to read battlefield reports full of gunpowder, new and substantial poems, soul-stirring plays, and beautiful and robust novels. They talk about the characters and vivid battle scenes displayed in each literary work. Finally, they gradually felt that literary works were not enough.</p>
<p>Yes, I don't think anyone would satisfiedly admit that our literary works during the War of Resistance have been quite sufficient in terms of quantity and quality, right?</p>
<p>What I want to mention now is the issue of the substance of literary works. But I don't want to review the past here. What I especially want to point out is that our writers have paid too little attention to the question of "atmosphere" in literary works.</p>
<p>Here, I should quote a passage from Forster:</p>
<p>"If the author wants to enhance the reality of his characters, and wants to give the kind of tension required by that action to the main mechanism in his works, then this subtle relationship between things and environment, which is very difficult to obtain, is the most important thing for him. Naturally, this is the nature that most novels with social phenomena as the theme lack. The socialist author's attitude towards 'atmosphere' is certainly different from that of the old realist writers, but he cannot despise it. He can learn the same good methods of creating 'atmosphere' from past writers and from the best novelists of modern times. ... The author must try very subtly to express the transformation of 'atmosphere'."</p>
<p>Currently, our country is immersed in a vigorous struggle, and every small part of everyone's life is closely linked to this great and sacred struggle. Therefore, our literary works are reflecting these great dynamics and artistically organizing people's consciousness. If those works that belonged to yesterday were rewritten by our writers today, we can imagine what kind of results they would reap.</p>
<p>When a writer writes a work, he must pay a lot of attention to the process of transformation of "atmosphere" in his own works. In the process of transformation of "atmosphere", it is necessary to grasp these new factors. And it is necessary to control the "atmosphere" very naturally.</p>
<p>When I read Gorky's "The Forties", he endowed those characters in "Wood Money", and in "Dune Sand", with a character and action that were influenced by the "atmosphere" he controlled. We can explain it from its opposite. In this successful masterpiece, we can study how these "atmospheres" are created. —— We must never ignore Gorky's substantial life!</p>
<p>Therefore, it is also necessary to observe reality more! And to analyze it carefully, to understand the new factors that constitute the development and results of reality.</p>
<p>It is necessary to write the spiritual food that the soldiers need, and be able to live with the soldiers, so our writers will write the most considerate works. —— The question of "atmosphere" in literary works that has been raised is closely related to the question of enriching the lives of our writers.</p>
<h3>Countrymen</h3>
<p>— Lv</p>
<p>In the afternoon, two countrymen in their twenties, each carrying a rattan basket, walked one after the other towards the small city gate. The one in front, seeing the yellow-clothed guard, bowed to him as usual, put the rattan basket on the ground, opened the lid, and let him inspect it.</p>
<p>There was only one yellow-clothed guard. As usual, he didn't say a word, put on a stern face, leaned down with one hand on his gun, and stirred up the contents of the rattan basket with the other hand. Impatient, he threw it on the ground as soon as he turned it out.</p>
<p>The countrymen in the back began to do the same as the one in the front, bowing, placing the rattan basket on the ground, and opening the lid. But the yellow-clothed guard was inspecting the first rattan basket and did not notice the second rattan basket. And the [basket] was also somewhat to his side, making it difficult for him to see.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the countrymen in the back took out a small black thing from the second basket. Taking advantage of the yellow-clothed man's lowered head, he pointed the mouth of the small thing at his temple and pulled the trigger. With a pop, the yellow-clothed man fell to the ground, blood gushing out from his temples.</p>
<p>The two countrymen threw the rattan baskets on the ground and turned to run.</p>
<p>The sound alarmed the other yellow-clothed men in the Guandi Temple inside the big city gate. They, about five or six of them, rushed out to see what was going on. At a glance, they knew what had happened. They left two people to attend to the man on the ground and chased after them. However, after crossing the drawbridge, turning two corners, and reaching the crossroads, they had no way to go. They could only stop and hesitate.</p>
<p>Of course, they didn't know that the intruders had already escaped from that street and couldn't chase them in that direction. Also, they knew very well that no matter which street they went down, they could only go half a li before they reached the end, and beyond that were fields and villages. And the fields and villages were a forbidden area that they didn't dare to enter easily.</p>
<p>After asking people on the street without getting any results, they mumbled to each other for a while and had to return to the city.</p>
<p>At the small city gate, while they were cleaning up the dead companion on the ground, they re-examined the things on the ground. Among the broken clothes and messy paper, they found a letter. They opened it and saw the following words inside.</p>
<p>...Don't赖[rely on] dying inside the city walls! If you have the guts, come down to the countryside and let's see who's better on the battlefield! If you don't come down, we'll come up.</p>
<p>Now, let's give you a little color to see...</p>
<p>Below was a formal name: Li Yilong, Captain of the ×× Army's ×× Squad.</p>
<p>Everything was handed over to the city garrison headquarters, and the commander sent someone to find Guo Laoer to discuss it.</p>
<p>Guo Laoer was originally a local bully and was despised by the villagers. Because of his meritorious service in welcoming the yellow-clothed men, they sent him to work in the "Police Bureau". From then on, he said he had obtained the law, and he had wealth and power.</p>
<p>When Guo Laoer arrived, he said that this matter could not be easily let go, and at least a demonstration should be held. They discussed it and divided into half of the people, about fifty or sixty, lined up and left the city. When they reached the crossroads, they went straight ahead, regardless of the left or right.</p>
<p>The street ended, but after another three li, they reached a town. This was Guo Laoer's hometown. Everyone saw Guo Laoer walking at the head of a group of yellow-clothed men, and they all cast poisonous glances at him. They cursed in their hearts, "Shameless beast!" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>In Spring</h3>
<p>— Chang</p>
<p>Warrior, Talents, Cat, Old Man Essay</p>
<p>It is now spring, yes, it brings warmth, comfort, vigor, and the vitality of life. We like spring, but often there is warmth, vigor, and the vitality of life. Spring may have its seductiveness, but it can never make the heroic, rational warrior feel depressed, annoyed, or irritable. Although they, who were in icy and snowy conditions, are more active in the spring, continuing a more severe struggle. Shelley said: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" That's right; it's this spring.</p>
<p>"In the third month of late spring, grasses grow in Jiangnan, miscellaneous flowers bloom on trees, and orioles fly in a chaotic manner." This is originally a phenomenon of spring, but it does not yet grasp the rich meaning of spring. We love Jiangnan, and we also love Jiangbei. We love long grass, we love miscellaneous flowers, we also love the White Mountains, we also love the Black Water, even love ice and snow, love wind and rain, love hail, love thunder and lightning. The motherland's great earth is warm everywhere, with its fragrance, even if it is not in spring, we express even greater love, and all of it is forever greater strength. We are forever developing the power of strong battle.</p>
<p>In the feeling of some talented people, spring can become lazy and endlessly lingering. ": "Good times and beautiful scenery, what can be done? Whose courtyard is a delightful thing?" Isn't that the evening's troubles? "A ten-thousand-gold sword is hidden in the autumn waters, and a horse is full of spring sorrows pressing on the embroidered saddle." That was originally the heroic-style spring's suffering of sexual depression of those who are good at sadness and disease. There are not a few romantic talents under the sky, "The flowing water and fallen flowers are gone in spring, in the heavens and on earth." It is precisely the heartbreaking sound before decline, "Leave the soul behind, the remaining body seeks ashes; the green fire does not go out, illuminating the Yan Terrace every night"! "Young heads" are bound to vent a little in secret when they fail in the spring, although they still act in such a secretive manner.</p>
<p>Let us praise the greatness of the power of spring, even if some people dare not face it squarely.</p>
<p>The arrival of spring this year brings with it a solemn and cold atmosphere, but we use a more tragic and joyful heart to caress it, and then let it fly by leisurely. Next year's spring will come again!</p>
<p>That's right, it will come, next year's spring. But even if it is spring, flowers will not grow on the cold white bones. The sorrowful emotions of the samurai talents have been touched, and they are angry, resentful, distressed, and worried, "Spring closes the dreamers" and then takes a long, faint breath. Apart from the venting of wild crab instincts, there is only a full emptiness, "Waiting is having a home but not returning" Ah, ah, ah!</p>
<p>Then the beauty of spring came, the cat was calling on the roof, and the samurai talents under the eaves heard it and immediately went crazy hysterically, finally launching a general attack, a small team surrounded, Dong, Dong, Dong! The spring call stopped sorrowfully, and the cat fell down. But it was even more lonely, and the talents were even more desolate, "A subtle symbol of depression"! Frowning and gnashing their teeth, they felt the same as the cat, in spring.</p>
<p>However, there is no spring in their country, "The authorities of the country yesterday entertained experts in the film industry to explain that films depicting lucky games, which are recognized by the agency as having a negative impact, are also excluded from the ban (according to a Haitong telegram on April 6)." Oh my god, they strangled the cat's heart like this first, and they have already grown old, not acknowledging this article. This line is dead, and they have already grown old, not acknowledging that this is spring—but even if they want to return to youth, it is also a matter of heaven's lack of skill; to prevent this spring, they first carry out the work of castration, and they are usually indifferent to the crazy enjoyment of military-industrial capitalists. This is due to ten thousand new tax increases at work.)</p>
<p>They give you a small amount of non-inheritance, and make some young talents swallow their voices" (the samurai's "calling the sky and pushing the earth" spirit has long been gone from tradition.) However, this reflection is increasingly seen as its foundation is unstable.</p>
<p>Recalling that the Aixin Gioro clan was at the end of the dynasty, although it had also reached the stage of reflection, the skills of "obeying the mandate of heaven" were still done quite well. In response to the "faint smoke and sparse falling flowers" test, there was a sentence "flowers fall but spring remains", which was highly praised by the officials (see Notes from the Chun Zai Hall.) That was to cater to the rulers' mentality of "concealing" the inevitable decline of the world. "Spring often stays here, send! Ah!" Now, I have never heard them start all over again. It's just "concealing" to console the loneliness. The "emptiness" of the Aixin Gioro ruling class itself was already clear. However, that dynasty's unreserved talk of the "falling flowers" phenomenon of Mo Lu undoubtedly had great courage, and they admitted spring.</p>
<p>In the aging period, we still have to castrate spring, and the collapse of a certain ×× is just around the corner. — Whether you admit spring or not is up to you.</p>
<p>A certain warrior filled in the word abacus in suffering, although it also has some talented meaning, but it shows his fighting demeanor. The second half is: "Flowers fall and know the remnants of spring, let the wind and rain go; believe that spring will come again next year, and there should be the same fragrance as before."</p>
<p>Even if this year's spring is solemn and cold, we will welcome him with a tragic and joyful heart, and the arrival of next year's spring will be warmer, and we will be even more joyful.</p>
<h3>Inferior People</h3>
<p>— Wen Zongshan</p>
<p>Woodpeckers specialize in finding their food in trees, while pests living in trees are always avoiding their targets.</p>
<p>There are always two different kinds of people in society, which can never be solved with emotion, namely brave people and inferior people.</p>
<p>Late at night, thinking about these small questions, I hope to give myself an unusually accurate answer and clarify my thoughts.</p>
<p>Today I found a satisfactory answer and saw the symbolic woodpeckers and corrosive insects. To put it bluntly, the brave and the inferior are performing very vividly and tragically against the enemy.</p>
<p>Penetrating into the temptation of profit and falling into the deep abyss of wealth, such a person, an inferior fellow, was killed by the brave man according to justice. Someone was surprised, this is "assassination". I said; it's ordinary. Many people are willing to "die for gold", not to mention that this death is quick and its "going to sea" for fame and profit is rapid, which is directly proportional. If you say it's strange, you are probably surprised that his method of death is ordinary, not to everyone's satisfaction, and let's execute him under the judiciary.</p>
<p>Corrosive insects can never escape the woodpecker's sharp beak. You should know that when its sharp beak and tongue curl up the insect, it is an opportunity to tell you the answer.</p>
<p>Inferior people will one day be killed by the brave.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>The sky outside the window is already bright, but the turbid air has not spread out, and the darkness still fills every corner; this is not an ideal morning, with a clear sky and a fiery red sun——</p>
<p>Suddenly, she woke up.</p>
<p>At this time, on the dressing table, someone had already prepared new toothbrushes, toothpaste, towels, soap, and a washbasin filled with warm water for her.</p>
<p>She stretched lazily, glancing unintentionally, and saw a person standing in front of her bed. She recognized him—the thug, guide, companion, protector of last night. Everything about him was no longer the impression she had of him last night. He had changed into neat student clothes, and his hair was combed very neatly; it seemed that he was a student who had received higher education, or an unemployed youth with ideas. At the very least, he was a polite company employee. In short, now he was someone who would not make people feel disgusted, and could even make people feel that he was cute: a tall and healthy body, a broad and protruding chest, especially a face full of youthful energy, with a smile that could not be hidden and humble eyes. From his current posture, one can no longer see the traces of his bravery, arrogance, suspicion, intelligence, ruthlessness, and affection of last night. Today, he is an ordinary young man, almost so ordinary that he has no personality. On his ordinary surface, she discovered his nature that she had not discovered last night, kind and pure; he was the embodiment of all the beauty of the soul. Last night and today, the distance between them is only a short distance in life; but last night he was someone to be avoided, and today he is someone to be approached. He showed two completely opposite types.</p>
<p>When she saw him wearing a new bandage around his neck, she was moved by a wise force, and he himself temporarily forgot his worries. She got out of bed, still wearing the clothes she had not taken off last night. She was like a friend of a patient who had suffered an unexpected misfortune, and at the first condolence, she was very concerned about the other party's injuries, although she already knew the origin of the other party's injuries, but she still habitually and unnecessarily asked: (46)</p>
