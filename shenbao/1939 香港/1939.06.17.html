<p>社評</p>
<h3>英法美應該怎樣對付天津事件？</h3>
<p>日軍封鎖天津英法租界日來情勢更加變本加厲，日方的根本目的，已不出我們日前的評論，不外是要威脅英法放棄援華抗日的政策，壓迫我國的抗戰行動和宣傳，天津日方發言人業已聲明：「縱使英方將四華人引渡，亦不能解决目前的問題，蓋封鎖的目的，是在獲取在華英當局更廣大的合作」。而所謂合作云者、當不外乎日本前此向英國听提之要求：「英國應協助日本建設東亞新秩序」（倫敦「每日郵報」所揭載）。換言之，卽要求英國帮助日本趕跑美法，　　　　　　　、好讓「超人」的日本帝國獨霸東亞。司馬昭之心，路人已皆見，假　　　　　　　　，認天津事件爲地方事件，欲以妥協了事，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　有　　　　。此點，英國一般輿論及略明日本現狀的政治家，皆已明白討論過了，　　　國當局不　　　　了。現在最重要的問題，就是英法美該怎樣應付這一嚴重的局勢。</p>
<p>英國應付日本整個進攻策略的第一辦法，就是認識要透澈，態度要堅决，手段要敏捷。天津事件，日方旣然聲明不是地方事件，而是要英國根本改變對中日戰爭的基本政策，那末，現在要　　　　是　　能不　　　　　　國，　　　　獨　，才可能、乘　的　　就　　　　硬對　　。或者有些英人憂慮强硬對付日本的結果，會引起英日的武力衝突，演成英日戰爭。但這是過慮，須知日本內部的矛盾也極多，喜歡日本與第三國擴大衝突的意見，已經不是主潮，在外日軍之所以蠻幹者，不過是欲藉此鎭壓這種反戰的主潮而已。所以英國能强硬到底，日軍當不難柔軟下去</p>
<p>英國對付日本的蠻幹，不能徒托空言，更不能永久在那裏考慮，現在最重要的是如何實施有力有效的辦法罷了。第一步最有效的辦法，就是經濟制裁，宣佈取消日本所享受的特惠條欸，　　　　人英　　　　的　土，　　　　　　　　的　　　　，或冒牌日貨，禁止所有資源輸出日本，更進一步維持法幣以打擊日幣及僞幣，禁止日本輪船進出英國港口等等。這些方法貴在早日施行，使陷在泥土中的日本，立刻感到仇英的危險。</p>
<p>第三，英國要切實和法美合作，法美也應有此覺悟。美國既不能斤於調解，裝作第二者隔岸觀火，法國更不能坐視別國受困，主權受蹂躙，如十四日日軍竟可以闖入法方防綫，將美商廿世紀福福克斯電影公司美籍攝影師捕去。其實，美當局意見已承認：「英法美三國在華所享有的條約權利大致相同，英法兩國天津權益受危害時，美國權益亦同樣受危害。巴黎方面亦主張英法已可以同時實施封鎖商港，禁止日本商船利用了」。</p>
<p>天津事伴是日方攫奪听有租界逼走英法美的序曲，英法美需要更澈底的覺悟呀！</p>
<p>山西通信</p>
<h3>到了×軍的後方</h3>
<p>一月十四日我們在鄭州附近的榮澤口渡河，河對岸正有×××軍的一連兄弟來歡迎。</p>
<p>一個月，我們自由地行踏在河北的大地上，從豫北到山東六區，經冀南來到了冀東，我們走過了原武，陽武，濮陽，館陶，淸河，棗强，武邑，武强等縣在二月六日那一天，我們在饒陽附近的一莊子　會到了總司令部。</p>
<p>現在，我們的經常工作已經開始了十幾天了。</p>
<p>在行軍的過程中，一天行走七八十里路，在我們看來那要算頂平常的了，每個同志的步子都非常豪健。從淸冷的朝晨五點鐘到昏暗的黃昏後的六七點鐘，這都是我們呼吸和歌唱在原野上的時候，晚上，睡在晒着乾草的地上，窗紙是沒有的，夜風　愛着我們的臂膀和面頰，我們合衣睡下了，疲乏使我們很快地奔入甜蜜的夢鄉。小米飯和冷饅頭是我們最得意的飲食，菜是沒有希望吃到的，這　的營養，這樣的生活。都使我們日見　壯了、</p>
<p>道路是被破壞了的。但是我們仍然結成一條長的行列在行進，血紅的　日照耀着我們這條蟒蛇在華北的平原上躍進。我們快樂讓歌聲嚮澈在原野和晨空</p>
<p>每一個莊子上都有自銜軍持着槍在守衛。每個村莊內都有我們的隊伍在駐防。（×路軍，石軍團，丁樹本的隊伍）許多在後方看不到的口號，標語，　報，傳單，到處張貼着，到處散發着。土黃的牆上，刷寫着白色的標語：</p>
<p>「合理負担！」</p>
<p>『鞏固統一戰線！』</p>
<p>我們感到異常的暢快，每次途經村落的時候，都有當地農民給我們預饞好了開水慰勞我們，爲我們從井裏提水飲馬，無論是老年人或是年幼的孩子都在向我們親切地打着招呼：</p>
<p>『同志！休息休息吧！』</p>
<p>「餓不餓呀！」</p>
<p>有一次，路過一個莊子，兩個老百姓一直戀戀不捨地把我們送到莊頭。久久地站在那裏留戀着我們的背影。</p>
<p>我們到處受到歡迎，有幾次，農民們全打着小紙旗，上面寫着：『歡迎×××軍！』『歡迎戰地服務團，』等口號來迎接我們。親切的我們如同囘到了故鄕雖。然在時間極度不允許下，但，我們仍抽暇工作，在每一天駐宿莊村的時候，睡眠前晚飯後的時間我們全花費在宣傳和拜訪工作上。間或也和同行的武裝同志召開座談會，討論時事和各　問　。</p>
<p>在武邑和棗强等地我們利用了晚間的時間演了戲。在武　演戲的時候，因爲觀衆過於擁擠和興奮的緣故，戲台被擠倒了，這囘，台上合下可眞打成了一片，還好，沒有傷到人。</p>
<p>我們到處受到歡迎：才到　强，武邑的政治部便打電話來約我們；並且特別派人來迎接我們。這裏，我們應該向你們誇耀，我們受到款待，吃了許多肉的飯食。我們非常快活：我們覺不出這是×人的後方，我們覺得這比祖國的後方還自由，還活潑，各方面的環境都使我們感到滿意和興奮！同樣地，各地都在迫切需要大批的幹部。在都市中的救亡靑年們——在後方的靑年同學們，前方需要你們！前方是快樂的呀！</p>
<p>在這兒，我們聽到了××師長，呂正操司令的寳貴的訓話，那些鋼鐵的句子打動了我們每一佃同志，更加堅定了我們在×後工作的信念，我們演戲的時候，他們也在軍務忽忙中抽暇來看過，同時也由於劇情的發展而憤怒，甚至於落淚。</p>
<p>另外一點，値得我們特別着重地向你們報吿的，那就是現在我們完全生活在戰　中，×人最近正在加緊『蕩掃』華北游擊區，特別是冀中。我們因爲戰略的原因，許多少城鎭都自動地放棄了。我們的確地做到了困憊×人的「堅壁淸野」策略。激烈的戰鬥到處在演奏着。</p>
<p>我們經常地可以廳到震耳的砲聲和槍聲，有一次，我們和×人相距只十路，但是，我們沒有一綵兒畏　的相念，我們堅信我們戰鬥部隊的勇邁，同時。我們更科學地相信我們這樣主動的以退爲進的戰略是會得到勝利的。所以，我們依然活躍在各部隊在各地各村莊，提筆寫信的時候，槍炮聲正震響在南方二十　左近的地方，但是，我們却安然地排着戲呢！</p>
<p>工作在呼喚着我們使我們不能向你們做更多的有意義的報吿，由於時間的忽迫，許多値得個別的或是詳細的和你們談的事情，一時竟想不起來了。讓它就這樣結束吧！</p>
<p>我們在担心　這封信是不會被×人查去，而不能安然地投落在你們的面前呢？</p>
<p>祝福你們工作騰利！</p>
<p>請你們到前方來，前方需要你們！</p>
<p>（周鵬程）</p>

<p>應該保存沙河的清潔</p>
<p>早上起來，天氣仍是陰沉的，不過沒有雨我們就依照昨晚的决定，到長寧去做早飯，六時，我們整裝起程，沿小路前往。我們　着　　的田隴小徑，跑了五　路的光景就達水邊，水邊是跑沙河西北的岸上、我們就要在這裏過渡。</p>
<p>沙河的水是混　的，這大槪是雨天的關係，上流　有一二隻小舟順流駛下來，船尾艙有鍋壚的灰烟　出，這　情狀，那船兒有遠行的準備無疑我好奇地問渡夫：一爲什麼？在這軍事緊張時期，我們這些船隻還可以駛向下游，到×人的佔領地麼？」「多得很、現在這種船正好撈錢。」渡夫很自然地　　說。</p>
<p>我聽了渡夫這一句話後，好奇的心已不自在起來，像餓狼聽到羔羊的叫聲般，緊緊地追問渡夫和同渡的人，關於一好撈錢』的由來。</p>
<p>原來×人最近利用漢奸在石龍大做買賣，以高價收買食粮，用賤賣推銷仇貨，在博羅紅石價銀僅　四元至五元的榖、一到石　可値十四元至十六元，鶏每担在　羅　一百元，到了石龍也値二百四十元。在石龍運火柴烟枝及布疋等來內地可得到二倍的利息，這樣一來，奸商就悄悄地活動，有意無意替×接濟粮食了。所以水路上的船兒是忙碌的還，陸路上小販也忙碌的　，沙河就成了給患貧血症的×人的施血管。</p>
<p>事情是相當嚴重的，沙河就是貫通博羅腹部的　一小河流。木船可由象頭由下的響水直駛至崗，龍華，九潭、東博而達石龍、道樣，在這時候，每一隻船兒的上落，都有利×人，增加抗戰困難的。（黃縣長和駱　令知道了這些情形後，就馬上把這條河流封鎖起來了，並且開始注意了這條河，的政治工作，從而捕獲了幾個漢奸，這是最令我們興奮的一囘事　——　符內的文字是客稿時補上的，當我們渡沙河的時候和現在的確是不相同了。</p>
<p>現在地方當局正加緊肅　工作，博羅的同胞應該保存沙河的淸潔，不要給漢奸弄汚濁。</p>

<h3>汪精衛與土肥原</h3>
<p>— 夏衍</p>
<p>講起日本在華的特務機關就會聯想到土肥原、這位遠東的勞倫斯對於國人約印象確是太深刻了。所以汪精衛一離重慶，汪精衛和土肥原之間的傳說二就一直不曾中止過，上海流傳得最普遍的一種關於汪精衛行止的說法，也說汪於四月十二日下午坐日本軍艦到上海，寓百老匯大廈十六層樓、當日會見土肥原，次日到法租界訪問×大使。這也就是人們將土肥原認爲日本特務機關之象徵的「一個例子」。其實，四月中旬土肥原並不在上海，他於三月十四日離上海，已經調任到黑河去當警備司令了。他調任的原因，倒和汪精衛問題有若密切的關係，說得明白一點，土肥原對於汪精衛問題上和坂垣降相之間有了意見的衝突，他的調任是一種懲處，土肥原在最近一個階之內，最少是可以說已經「失脚」了。</p>
<p>汪精衛和日本特務機關直接發生關係，是在武漢棄守之前，這是大家熟知的事了，最初是高宗武到日本，但是他接洽的却不是土肥原，而是降軍省軍事課長的影佐，九月中，影佐偕參謀本部中國班班長今　來香港，興汪的代表人作進二步合作的商討，這交涉，當然是在板垣的同意之下進行的。十月底，廣州武漢失守，日本特務部最初的計劃是汪精衛脫出重慶，坐飛機到廣州，樹立政府，但是這做法似乎大魯莽了，一則由於汪本人的遲疑，二則由於顧××的反對，不能實現。於是第二個計劃是：汪精衛設法出國，到他住慣了的法國去『養病』，日本特派谷正之爲駐法大使，不很被人注視地在法國商議組織新政府辦法，和與希脫勒，墨索里尼『兩哲』聯系的間題。但是谷正之使法這事，却表面上因爲谷正之在上海有渦反法言論而被法國政府拒絕了，這計劃又成了水泡，法國政府是否事前知道了有這樣一個陰謀而拒絕谷的「同意』，我們沒法可以知道，不過汪精衛和日本特務工作者之間有過這樣二個擬議，那是祇要翻一翻去年舊報，就可以在差不多的時間之內發現「某要人使歐說」的新聞，加谷正之使法被拒的報導，而發出會心的微笑的。</p>
<p>『統一戰線』似乎並未曾在日本陸軍的幾個物務巨頭之間成立，板相——影佐積極進行中的這一樁對汪精衛的買賣，對被認爲遠東勞倫斯的土肥原，却保守着絕對的秘密。影佐對汪活動最猛烈的時候，土肥原正在進行着另一個對象，土肥原爲着獲取唐××來當華南華中的總傀儡，曾經化了不少的心血，但是功敗垂成，是這老年人在一個廣東靑年的斧頭下葬送了，士肥原失掉了唐××，便猛然地以全力進行另一個對象，那便是華北擁吳（佩孚）出山的那一幕了。</p>
<p>汪精衛的艷電在土肥原感到的衝擊恐怕比任何人還要强烈這樣大的陰謀完全不給他知道，這顯然是對他的一種不信和侮辱了，他是一個「汪精衛說」的反對者，他反對黨出身的人來收拾時局比任何人還要堅决，於是在日本陸軍的特務工作方面，形成了兩個對峙的壁壘，主張擁（用）吳的土肥原和他的系統，和主張用汪的板坦，影佐和東條。這兩派在二月中旬東京召集的軍事會議上有了劇烈的爭論，在三月上海舉行的「出先軍事幹部會議一竟從爭論進一步而展開了白刃的亂鬥。出先軍幹會議上意見紛歧，最激烈的以秩父宮爲首領的少壯派根本反對中涂和議，反對「起用」汪精衛，土肥原派意氣地主張着汪精衛和××有默契，用汪就無法「滅黨」，而影佐東條那一派却認爲士肥原的對華認識已經「時代落伍」，不適官於現時的中國，當時土肥原和少壯派在反對用汪這一點上聯合起來，要求囘國澈底淸算在華軍事，形勢極度緊張，這「白刃亂嗣『的消息傳到東京，板垣恐怕事態擴大，命令岡村甯次緊急處置，調任十肥原爲黑河警備司令，實質上剝奪了他在華中和華南的發言權，士肥原爲着洩憤，授意和知（有名的小士肥原）透漏了汪精衛和平沼的密的，和知將這機密透露給中國人謝某，於是「汪平沼協定」就在重慶報上揭露了，</p>
<p>不可一世的遠東等倫斯，在他經歷上今年是二個不很順利的時期，也許是過去太順利而樹敵太多的原故吧。在華中，他沒有地盤，僞上海市政府。是海軍的勢力範圍，別當這小子已經不賣了他的賬「維新政府」呢？楠本是接近影佐的，舊地盤華北呢？喜多誠一也已經羽翼成長，要和他分庭抗禮了。在黑河的土肥原假使能看到「四月十二日汪土在江　葉園會談」的電訊，也許禁不住寂寞的苦笑吧。（轉載桂林救亡日報）</p>

<h3>新的傀儡劇</h3>
<p>今天路透社消息、說日×將以汪精衛為傀儡，代王克敏，希望能於七月七日宣佈改組傀儡政府，或將以新聯合方式出之·</p>
<p>日×侵華兩年，不論在軍事上政治上經濟上都已遭遇挫敗，不能不加緊政治上的陰謀，因此就有汪精衛之準備排演新傀儡劇。然而十四日上海字林西報說得對：「縱使汪為日方借重，出任傀儡政府　袖，　亦難獲得一般人民的擁護·」其實、又何止難得人民的擁　，　乎汪精衛　今日在上海等地之以恐怖手叚對付反汪反和平遝動者，就可瞭見其末路窮途了！</p>
<p>但是，汪精衛的倒行逆施固然終必失敗，而汪等及　蹤汪等之後，以破壞全國團結動搖抗戰信念的言行，却尚足以阻碍抗戰　國事業！中央之明令嚴緝汪逆·×××××××××××××！李漢魂等將領和海外　胞巳先後通電擁　中央緝汪明令了，凡是不願做亡國奴的中國人及其社團，都　應莫不關心×××××！</p>

<p>有人對此種露宿男女的救濟辦法，要求當局嚴重注意：（一）××××，（二）屋租問題，（三）物價問題，（四）交通問題。當然這四個問題如能獲得適當解決·則不　露宿男女可望絕蹤，卽整個社會的安全秩序亦可獲得保障，　許多个幸事件亦可望其減至絕少了·」</p>

<p>P&gt;標準妻子測驗</p>
<p>你是一個標準妻子嗎？</p>
<p>夫人，你是一個標準妻子　？你要做一個標準妻子嗎？這里有十個問題，請你依下面的計分方法，去測騐你自己一下！</p>
<p>〇分……絕不　根本沒有那回事　不幹</p>
<p>一分……偶然　難得　稍微一點見</p>
<p>二分……平平　不一定　有時候</p>
<p>三分……常常　很多　多半</p>
<p>四分……完全　絕對的</p>
<p>人是難免有偏見的，為求　確起見，頂好，你自己記一次分；再請你的先生用客觀的態度，也來記一次分·把兩次的結果，加起來，除個二，那麼，你的眞正標準程度就出來了！</p>
<p>最高的分數，是四十，那便是十足標準妻子·普通的，在二十五以上，也是好妻子了。如果，不幸你在二十分以下，我勸你要留心一點，不然，你的婚姻前途或許要有點小憂慮呢！下面是正題。</p>
<p>一，你努力將你的家庭造成一個能休息，能散心，生動，有趣的樂園嗎？</p>
<p>二，你鼓勵你的丈夫常常出去和他的男友同遊，寧可自己孤單單的留在家中　？</p>
<p>三，你調製菜肴，是十分可口，并且時常更動嗎？</p>
<p>四，你管理家務像治理　業一般認眞嗎？</p>
<p>五，你將自己修飾得很動人，使你的丈夫引以為榮，願意人人都知道你是他的妻子嗎？</p>
<p>六，你老是愉快，溫柔，不如怨如訴，不喋喋不休，不堅持你自已的行動或主張嗎？</p>
<p>七，你始終推崇你的丈夫，不將他和那些比他成功的人作此較，而設法使他覺得他自已也是成功的人嗎？</p>
<p>八，你阻止你的母親和其他的親戚不來過份打擾，同時，你對他的親戚，都表示尊敬與好感嗎？</p>
<p>九，你對他的事業，表示同情與關切，但是由他自己去幹，非到他詢問你時，絕不參加意見，不批評挑剔嗎？</p>
<p>十，你能够訓練你自己，對他的朋友和愛好發生興趣，因而　可以做他閒暇時最好的伴侶嗎？預告：明天刑登「標準丈夫測驗」·</p>
<h3>小問題</h3>
<p>王先生家里生了四條小狗，別的不會，只會吃，而更要搶打。現亦把它們的食堂分開。但是，要劃清四條路綫，令它們各不相犯，相安無事。你有辦法畫嗎？沒有的話，明天告訴你。</p>
<h3>一日一人</h3>
<p>愛因斯坦敎授，這位發明相對論的天才家，最怕社交，應酬，演說及接見記者一類事·一九三〇年，他去美國，發　謝絕這些花樣。可是一到紐約，可就身不由主了，午安，茶會，晚宴，談話，演講，播昔，觀劇，遊覽：整整忙了五天·最後一天晚上，他滿以為可以好好地休息一下了，可是，當他才在旅邸里坐定，一羣記者又來詢問他游美的感想了。他不禁大氣，　了起來：「立刻給我滾開！」但當那羣記者垂頭喪氣，才出鬥的時候，他又趕上去叫着：「囘來，靑年們，我來答覆你們的問題」。他原也不准記考畫像攝影的，但當他看見一個　術家，偷偷摸摸地　了一　素描，他把它拿過來，題了一句德文：「這隻營養過度的肥猪好像是愛因斯坦敎　·」</p>
<h3>雋語</h3>
<p>借東西給人家，不如送東西給人家，因為　所破費的差不多一樣——英記者吉勃。</p>
<p>沒有一件事能由委員會做成，除非這委員會中有三個委員，一　生病，另外一個缺席——凡龍</p>
<h3>雨花</h3>
<p>甲：朋友，你的　子漏得這樣，為什麼不修理一下？</p>
<p>乙：是呀！可是，下雨天工人不來修；天晴了，不是好好的嗎？我為什麼還要化錢修？</p>
<p>父：今天學校　講些什麼？</p>
<p>父：啞了嗎？問你話，怎麼不答？</p>
<p>子：今天先生講「三思而後行」·</p>
<p>顧客：你已經把那個漂亮的女店員辭退了嗎？</p>
<p>藥房經理：是呀，顧客們都說見到她一笑，就跟吃補藥一般　！</p>
<h3>氣象台</h3>
<p>今天天氣哈哈哈，想上去，又該是：陰　不定，或有風雨·昨天，氣象台的預測，是：陰晴不定，或有風雨·果然，上午陰，下午晴，不恰是個陰晴不定之局？有風却無雨，不正中了或有風雨的半個或字·本實　明，誰說氣象台預測不準。</p>
<p>說得不很客氣，或不敢推崇香港人會做生意，香港人連廣告，似乎都不大會做·不過，這兩天，却見到幾則出類拔萃的，願推薦給讀者·</p>
<p>××日報的分類廣告中：「××姊，妹自在故都中學畢業之後，卽未升學，七七事變展開，流落在此，現在××嚮導社服務，見報後望打電話一四五三四。「××夜報的新聞中：」諧角明星×××，日昨出外拍景，在亂墳中，演「棺材精」破棺盜寶一幕，不料棺內屍體，突然手足顫動，雙目炯炯發光，×××當堂失去三　七魄……彼云此種工作，以後不敢再試·」</p>
<p>最後，再提出中央戲院演「抗戰中國」的廣告：「我們固然要看此片，認識抗戰取勝的眞把握；×人也該一看此片，這使他知道崩潰在目前，漢奸更要一看此片，好讓他覺悟降×原是死路，」我看了這個廣告，我只有喊萬歲的份兒。</p>
<h3>小掌故</h3>
<p>當你把一封航空信丟進信箱裏去的　候，你曾想到航空郵遞是怎樣開始的嗎？這里且讓我來告訴你一些小掌故。</p>
<p>那是在整整的二十年前了。一九一八年五月十五日，歐洲大戰締和後不久的一天·在上午十一點半的時候，韋勃大尉駕起了他那架玲瓏的寇的斯機，自紐約貝雨門機場凌空向南飛去，揭開了紐約——費城——華盛頓之間　遞飛行的處女航·</p>
<p>同樣的，在華盛頓那一端，於美國人大總統威爾遜和他的閣僚們歡呼聲中，也有一架輕便飛機由鮑育中尉駕駛，朝北飛去。</p>
<p>在下午一點鐘光景，自紐約出發的韋勃中尉的飛機帶着三百四十四磅的郵件，降落在費城的郊外。而另一架飛機和另一倆駕駛員愛克登中尉便立刻賡續着踏上了第二叚航程——自費城至華盛頓——於兩點五十分，到達了目的地，完成了第一次的航郵。不幸的是鮑育和他的郵機，在　開華盛　的二十五哩的地帶，突然迷失了方向，結果被迫在中　降　下來，造成了航郵失事的　矢·而在費城等候着的保羅中尉，望穿秋水之餘，於二點三十分也逕自飛向紐約·到達目的地的時候，是二點三十七分·</p>
<p>在這一次處女郵航　，有着下列幾　小統計：航程二百十八哩，時間一百九十四分鐘，速度每小時七十五哩弱，郵　每盎斯兩角四分，信件最多的是美國威爾　大總統，計有十八封·</p>
<p>航郵小史</p>
<h3>海上風雲　六</h3>
<p>— 勞動上尉著　楊壁譯</p>
<p>前文　述　一九一四年，歐局已緊張時，美航輪「凱隆柏齊號」，載着六百萬金條，自紐約到德國去，邱克斯公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁　船去遊　歐洲。在船上他倆遇到法飛行家魯蒙加羅，和船上的德籍無線電員鮑佛，傑克在代飽工作時，接着個怪消息，設英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船·船長要求傑克正式担任船上的無線電員……</p>
<p>「我們不到毆洲去了，我們囘到美國的口岸，并且，想法避掉俘獲。六百萬金元，是個很火的彩頭，很　得他們追尋了。我不相信，我們　有機會能達到歐洲口·</p>
<p>傑克盤算了一會兒「好　！我猜我的假期反正是無望了，現在工作，和以後工作也是一樣。就這麼說，船主，我就算你的僱員吧」。</p>
<p>「這就好了，我不會使你吃虧的。」船主說·</p>
<p>這天的黃昏，吃晚飯時候，胞佛的工作時間完畢了，傑克坐在機前，天色很暗，英國巡洋艦上也不曾再有話傳來，「凱隆伯齊」又航行了許久，也不曾轉變方向，發過一封緊急的密碼電訊到紐約船公司，但是，這樣久還不曾有囘音。</p>
<p>可是，傑克工作着還不滿一個鐘頭，那期望　的命令終來了·那些旅客們，都正在甲板上，有的在散步，有的坐着，他們忽然都驚　起來，發現這條大船正慢慢的在掉頭，起先還不能相信，但是，立刻證實了，因為方才月亮是照在這一邊的，現在，却照到另一邊去了。</p>
<p>滿船上立刻議論紛紛，也許是機器間　出了毛病吧，也許是前面有冰山吧，也許是藏金子的地方發現了什麼意外吧，一切能想得到的話，滿　在這條大船上·他們想找船長，或者包　一個船員，來問個明白；但是，在這時候，一個也找不到·</p>
<p>將近午夜了，船長手裏拿着一封電報，獨自走進了吸烟室·</p>
<p>「先生們，」他向聚集在這房裏的人說，「我　為難，只能報告給諸位，英國和德國已經宣戰了。英國和法國，俄國將截擊我們的航路。」</p>
<p>室裏頓時騷擾起來，船長高舉着手，竭力鎭壓這　　嚷·等稱為　下來一點時，他又繼續　下去。</p>
<p>「這船是不可能再繼續前進了·諸位已經注意到，現在的方向是轉　了，我們正向囘美國的路上航行·</p>
<p>「到紐約？一許多　音問·</p>
<p>船長　搖頭，「紐約一定防範得比其他大西洋上一切的口岸更嚴。我還沒有决定到那處去，但是，我請求諸位，處在這種情形之下，需要理智一點，并且，想法安慰那些受　的女太太們。」</p>
<p>於是，一些紛亂的問句，和答語，興奮的談話又鼓噪起來，在這當兒，船長巨大的身體從門口消滅了。</p>
<p>之後不久，比雨南諾，因為在船上各處都找不到傑克，他跑進了無綫電室。</p>
<p>「你這是幹甚　？」他問·「你為這船服務嗎？」</p>
<p>「看起來是有這麼一囘事，是不是？」傑克微笑着·</p>

<h3>法幣匯兌的新措施</h3>
<p>— 襲家麟</p>
<p>本月七日晨香港中英匯兌平準基金委員會電滬暫停出售外匯以來，上海匯市掀起了巨大的　波、兩天的工夫、就從八辨士二五跌到了六辨士半，市場上五金洋貨價格擡高、而金　也受投機操　、狂張不已，社會人心，對於法幣雖仍始終保持信任，但一般見識較差者、難免受謠諑聳動、而露慌張之態、財政部對於此事、雖未有正式命令發表此項措置的詳細辦法、但薈集各方消息並依我人推測、政府似已决心　定新匯率於六辨士半左右、俾使其適應於國際的收支平衡、並對此後公開市場上外睢的供給、施以適對的限制、現在且將社會上當此新措置易生誤會之　作一闡明、並將其　義述之於後、</p>
<p>（一）政府變更　率平準並非放　維持法幣匯價政　，我們首先要對大家指明、政府的支持市場法幣匯價、並非自本年三月間中英匯兌平準基金設立始、所以這次平準基金會的暫行停止供給外匯、決不是說政府此後將置市場匯價於不顧，我們知道、政府在去年三月間施行外匯請核法時、便以　　的核准額來緩和匯價的跌落、六月中旬以後、政府更與匯　銀行合力維持匯價在八辨士以上的標準、以消殺投機的勢力、此項匯率、一直維持了十來個月的長久、到今年三月，為加强匯率穩定運用的　構起見、遂與英國成立外匯平準基金、以置匯率穩定於史堅强的基礎，不過我們須明白、設立此項匯　平準基金以穩定匯價的政策、正好像我國抗戰的基本軍略一樣、並不是應當不惜任何代價去堅守任何地方的、政府斟酌市場情形為權宜的措置、非但是正當、而且是必要的、今日政府鑒於非必需進口的突增而眨低黑市區價以調整貿易、以後也許會因為國際經濟情勢的　動而復提高匯價、這是同樣的可能、同樣的正當、</p>
<p>（二）政府此舉是自動的、積極的、</p>
<p>一個國家對於匯市的干涉、可分積極與消極的兩種、中國政府現在穩定黑市匯價於新標準、係採取先發制人的積極手段，這就是說、此項新措施决非因外匯資金枯竭被迫停　、乃是為防患未然而加　準備、我　有幾個很有力的根據，</p>
<p>一、自三月中旬匯兌平準基金　立以來迄本月初、總共還只不過兩個半月，就是依最極端的估計、一千萬鎊的平準基金、至少也能維持八辨士的匯價在一年半載以上、决沒有兩個半月就用光的道理、况月政府現在出口　制所得的外匯、已有很可觀的數目，自可用以隨時補充、使匯兌基金益臻鞏固、</p>
<p>二、南北兩　偽券，雖想竭力套取外匯、但據外人可靠的估計，「聯銀券」發行一年以來所調取到的法幣、尚不及華北法幣流通額的十分之一（卽約三千萬元）、「華興券」發行以來、因為流通上的阻碍、尚僅二十餘萬元、所以在這兩個半月內偽幣對於法幣外匯的壓力亦不甚大、</p>
<p>三、中國政府的在外存款與現金銀準備極充足、又不時有借款與僑民匯欵來充實、開戰以後、只有增加、沒有減少、如果必要的話、儘可運用一部份來維持八辦士二五的匯率、這是輕而易舉的事、</p>
<p>四、民國二十四年法幣政策施行以來、英美政府卽竭力予中國以協助、法幣的穩定、是英美在華保有重大投資權益者莫大的利益、如果法幣不能保持穩定、他們焉有不加支持之理、顯見此舉為中國與關係方面缜密商討的結果、完全是有計劃的積極的政策、</p>

<h3>糾正一個錯誤的觀念</h3>
<p>— 蘇</p>
<p>遇到一個朋友，問他近來在何處得意。他起初說賦閒在家，但繼則說在一隻小學校里擔任幾點鐘的功課，於是就似笑非笑地對我說：</p>
<p>「老兄，這是暫時躱一躱風雨的，將來有機會，哈，老兄！……」</p>
<p>把當小學敎師的神聖的事業　作為「暫時躱一躱風雨的」這種觀念，我想，在全中國各　的小學敎師中，有意識無意　地存在　的，恐怕不在少數之例吧。</p>
<p>這是小學敎育界的嚴重危機，因着這種非凡錯誤的觀念潛伏着，無疑將影響到我們中華民族的新芽的成長的。</p>
<p>我們應該糾正這一僩錯誤的觀念。</p>
<p>誠然，在目前，小學敎師是不被人所重視的，甚至是被人輕蔑的。「冷板凳」，「猢猻王」這些不雅聽的名稱，加諸小學敎師的身上，證明了小學敎師在一般的「社會地位」上的低落，當然，我們也不否認，在上海灘上，小學校也確成了在政治上和商業上失敗下來的英雄們的躱避風雨之處。然而輕蔑小學校敎師，正如輕蔑了他自身一樣，誇大點說，是對自己的祖國的一種罪行，說「兒　是未來的國家的主人　」，而又對迭成「兒童們」為「未來國家的主人翁」的事業，加以輕蔑，試想：這不是對組國的一種罪行是什麼？</p>
<p>再來一個誠然，小學敎師的確如人一般人所說，是「淸寒」的。一個汽車夫，他會比一個小學敎師的收入要來得高點。但是這里我們要明白，當「小學敎師」不是在商號里面當「經理」，是專門講『生意經」的。不　小學敎師是神聖的事業，是造成未來國家主人翁的敎育者我們不從「生意經」上若想，而要在「國家民族」的前途上去着想。當然，我在這里並不是說，對於小學敎師自身的待遇可以不要爭奪，可以置諸　後，相反，我們要爭取我們小學敎師的合理的生活條件的，這並不和我們的神聖的理想相衝突。</p>
<p>目前各地的小學敎師，他們雙肩上的職責，是和前綫上的武裝同志一樣的重大，在所謂「淪陷區」中，侵略者已把我們天眞無邪的朋友們的腦經，來加以改造，改造得適合他們的侵略意志，就是說改造得都成為　顧的小奴隸。我們在他們的報紙上，可以看見「兒　園地」，從新聞中，可以曉得有所謂「兒童親善交誼會」，為着預防游擊隊破壞鐵路交通，有所謂「　路愛護少年團」的組織，（這，我在將出版的短篇童話集「小鉛兵」中，已經寫成童話，揭破侵略老的狠心毒謀。）諸如此類的麻　組織以及其所謂敎育的措置，真是不一而足！我們的小學敎師們，難道可以抱，「躱避鳳雨」的觀念來跟「小把戲」們「　　」麼？</p>
<p>然是不能的！</p>
<p>我們不怕別人的輕　，只有在自己「自暴自棄」的時候，才會給人以輕蔑！我們應該糾正我們的「躱躱風雨」的錯誤觀念，我們要祖負起神聖的責任來！我相信，總有一天，輕蔑我們的人，會對我們道歡，而我們呢，也將是不愧為一個中華民族的忠誠的兒女。</p>
<h3>迎接戰門：</h3>
<p>— 于賽夫</p>
<p>夜鶯飛過了灌木林，鐵路邊是多麼靜寂啊，沒有一個人，月亮悄悄地在向小小的白花朶低語，然而，春天的風使白花朶兒向亂草叢裏抖縮地鑽去。</p>
<p>沒有一個人……</p>
<p>跟着浮雲飄開去的，是夜的冷寞，終於，人的影子從河邊的　　裏輕輕地輕輕地　浮到鐡路邊來了。</p>
<p>像鴨子撲着水濕的翅膀似　——僅僅是這一點些微的聲音，人影多麼衆多，他們缄默，他們溜過了皎潔的月光，他們穿過鐵路，又奔向黯黑的地方去了，就在穿過那無蔭無蔽的鐵路那一段，月光在他們的刺刀尖上微笑，明郎地微笑。</p>
<p>——來吧，那裏，向那裏！</p>
<p>於是，三個人抬著一架機關槍。蹤跳地找到了一個很靠得住的地方——隆起的堉墓。</p>
<p>——瞧，是的，那裏是火星—</p>
<p>——火星？……</p>
<p>——×人！</p>
<p>於是，有七個人匐伏在地上，　慢爬過去，向着那星亮的地方，其餘的，被佈置了一個弓形。機關槍手不時的側着腦袋，用一種銳敏的目光去注視一切的動靜，連那柑枝的搖動都被注視到了。</p>
<p>戰士們抹着臉上的汗……</p>
<p>遙遠的地方，有着星火，紅的綠的；浮雲變成了淡黃色，而天幕依舊是深　的。浮雲飄得更　　，風捲起來了，……一個戰士隨手拾起了一朶小的白花朶，月光凝在他的皺皮　黃的臉上。</p>
<p>他們在等待着一種强有力的聲音。</p>
<h3>從成都到西安</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>五、寧羌一宿</p>
<p>在組粗的幾句話中表現無餘了。</p>
<p>一自古常磋蜀道難，</p>
<p>而今川路更堪傷；</p>
<p>搭車難于謀美缺，</p>
<p>行程慢似渡重洋；</p>
<p>蛤蟆　畏威風大，</p>
<p>水亞員司逞兇　；</p>
<p>可憐旅客惟忍受，</p>
<p>勸君　後莫輕　。</p>
<p>附註：川路站長江某形似蛤蟆，站員呂某　似水鴨</p>
<p>「可慨　亡千里來，國營交通多　猜；漢中寧羌各為政，聯運票同視土灰。</p>
<p>存亡國　已如此，辦事猶然暮氣時；革命人心仍未革，長沙　息吟新詩。</p>
<p>半叟自江蘇武進流亡至此，目擊情形，感　兩　。廿七，四，二十。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>集體的打擊</h3>
<p>— 季子</p>
<p>侵略者的作風，向來　避實就虛畏强凌弱，按之過去史實，便可以證明，較遠的如張高峯事　，漁業糾紛，目前的如鼓浪嶼撤兵，每次都表明張牙舞爪是不足畏的，祗要面當着侵略者的人，確實拿點顏色，拿點實力出來，惡魔自然會放馬后砲溜之大吉的。</p>
<p>對待侵略者是絕不能姑息，更不能退讓，一次次姑息退讓，結果必然是養虎為　無疑。在歐洲就為了「　　　　」的妥協，阿比西尼亞，奧地利，捷克，西班牙，阿爾巴尼亞，先後被犧牲而告淪亡了；在遠東的情形又何嘗不如此？無限度的軟弱，無限度的退　，終於招致了種種經濟利益的損失。過去我們也為了在準備期中實力未足，九一八前後，對貪婪無畎的日本軍閥，極力避免衝突，因而廣大的祖國原野，一塊一塊的喪失了，我們淪於痛苦黑　中，度着奴　生活，所以如此還是由於當時步步退後的緣故，可是等到我們全國人民，下了最大决心，日本軍　尚在做着征服支那」迷夢時，我們的鐵　已有力地揮擊出去了，侵略者才從破碎的夢中驚醒過來，假如他們在七七事變中，早一點知道中國冉不頗退讓了，再不肯姑息了，我想，他們不見得就敢如此輕率動員。</p>
<p>打擊侵略者最忌採用个別行動，採用空碩抗議兩種戰術，因為侵略者是世界上最狡滑的傢伙，他們會遙相呼應，幫忙牽掣×人，　如歐洲有事了，遠東的侵略者會乘機奪取　門，海南，搖撼英美在華權益根基，以海軍威脅南海洋，這些都是很明確的歷史敎訓，證明除非集體行動被採用了，個別打擊是萬分費勁的，至於運用更强硬的實力打擊，如蘇聯所施於張高峯事件，漁業糾粉的行動，當然更屬上乘了！</p>
<h3>帶鞋子（下）</h3>
<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>——老奶奶的故事——</p>
<p>「現放在我的姨甥阿森家裏。」</p>
<p>接着，老奶奶就和李金根就說定，下半天他一有空，就到錢阿森的家裏去取鞋子豆錢也在那時帶去，不必現在給　，錢阿森所住的地方，老奶奶自然都詳細告訴了他。</p>
<p>老奶奶看見第一步目的己經達到，雖然藍子裏的豆還沒有賣完，就緩緩地下了茶樓，囘到錢阿森的家喪。</p>
<p>『會來的？』錢阿森一看見她就問。</p>
<p>『會來的。』老奶奶仍說，『但是你不要和他說什麼，聽我說。』</p>
<p>錢阿森是出名的快嘴，所以她不能不這搽可囑。</p>
<p>在下午三四點　的時候，李金根果然拐着腿來了。錢阿森非但不和他說什麼，却在招呼一聲之後，說走到外面去，在門口守着，看有人沒有　進來，或來竊聽。當然，這也是奶奶敎他的。</p>
<p>「真是謝謝你，」李金根走進來就說，「為我帶了鞋來。」</p>
<p>「你坐下來談談，鞋子等你囘去時我去取出來。」</p>
<p>『我家裏怎樣？』李金根就坐之後說。</p>
<p>『慢着慢着，』老奶奶連忙按住他，「我還有話和你說呢：你覺得一他們」待人眞是好的麼？以前你不是說，你在「他們」地方也不見得好麼？』</p>
<p>「以前，」李金根就又坐了下來，『我的確不覺得「他們」好；自從我受了傷，「他們」給我醫治，我就覺得「他們一好了。」</p>
<p>「你這個人眞是糊　透頂了—我只問你：你這傷是怎樣會受到的？」</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>在這樣一問一答之後，老奶奶所說明的，要不是「他們」來，他就受不到傷，當然更用不着「他們」的醫治；「他們」一來我們死的死，傷的傷，不死不傷的吃了多少苦；「他們」不來，或者來了就去，永不再來，我們就有好日子過了。</p>
<p>『你的話很不錯，』李金根聽老奶奶說了一會，然後點着頭說，「為什麼我早沒有想到，你倒會知道得這樣明白？」</p>
<p>這也難怪李金根要問，因為老奶奶畢竟是一個鄉下老婦人，怎麼會知道這些呢！等到老奶奶將一切的事情都告訴了他之　，他才恍然大　說：『哦，原來上次我上了你的當，將一切事情都告訴了你。』</p>
<p>『你說錯了。』老奶奶笑說，你並沒有上當；你作你應該作的事情。上當的是「他們」不是你。』</p>
<p>『那末你現在還要知道些什麼呢？』</p>
<p>『現在我並沒有一定要知道的事情，將來却很要知道一些應該知道的事情。』</p>
<p>她就一連串地指出了她應該知道的事情，也就是說，他，李金根，應該報告的事情。</p>
<p>『你一有消息，就來告訴阿森，讓阿森來告訴我們，因為你是不能走遠的，』</p>
<p>『這個不危險麼？』他有些遲疑。</p>
<p>『危險是有的，』老奶奶又給他解　，『但是幹得好，也就不會出危險、然而你要是怕危險不肯幹呢。然而你是要危險不肯幹呢，那危險就注定會臨到你和你的一家了，你想想！』說到最後一句，口氣有些嚴厲。</p>
<p>『什麼？』</p>
<p>她告訴他，我們巳經注意他，並且已經注意他的一家；也告訴他，假使誰都不肯出力，將來誰都要被『他們』宰割，消滅……</p>
<p>『卽使你在「他們」那利過到危險，我們不會志記你，我們要……』老奶奶更加澈底地說。</p>
<p>『好，我一定聽你們的話！』李金根拍着胸脯，作了最後的肯定。</p>
<p>『那末明天我就可以囘去了，』老奶奶歡然說，『你有什麼信要帶給你的家裏麼。』</p>
<p>『沒有什麼信，』李金根立起來說，『說我在這裏很好就是了。』又將手一伸說，『鞋子呢？給了我吧。』</p>
<p>『沒有帶來。』老奶奶忍着笑。</p>
<p>『什麼？』</p>
<p>『你的妻子還沒有做好呢，懂不懂？』老奶奶笑了出來。</p>
<p>『懂了懂了』李金根也笑了。『那末我又上你的當了。』</p>
<p>李金根走出大門時，老奶奶卻一把拉住了他，裝淸詫異的神氣說：</p>
<p>『什麼？你就這樣走了麼？吃了我那些豆？錢呢！』</p>
<p>『錢沒有帶來，　不識？』李金根在一呆之後，也笑了出來。</p>
<p>錢阿森聽見了，也作著會心的微笑。</p>
<p>李金根拐着腿，在歡笑的氛　中，離開了他們。</p>
<p>（完）</p>
<h3>詩兩首</h3>

<h3>閑話嚤囉街</h3>
<p>— 育萬</p>
<p>摩囉街沒有洋行，沒有辦庄，有的是古董舖·料　。</p>
<p>分開來說，骨芾列為一類，其中有銅器，玉器磁器、象牙，雕刻……或者是字書石山之類的東西；舊料也列為一類，其中有爛銅鐵　，　家具。玻　器皿，　舊眼鏡，影機和望遠鏡，自來水筆…之類的雜物品百幾十間舖，十餘個攤位。骨　，舊料，幾乎充　了每個空間。</p>
<p>夜在都市　都是最　秘的——摩　之夜，又是怎樣的呢？由於古　古香的骨董底陳列和鋪張，加上百人工打磨得輝煌　日的銅　器具，在燈光下晃耀着使人有點目眩。其中有巨型的古瓶，長可三尺的象牙，也有高不及一寸的玉佛，實不到五分的鼻烟……其他，一切的一切，仟憑你怎樣的留心，也沒法一一指點出來。在這裏為了人名的需求，雖一「釘」之　，也有它賣錢的價值！總之物無論大小，落到嚤囉街就得在錙銖計較中變成了「莫明其妙一的價錢！</p>
<p>關于骨董，他們寧可三年賣不出一件，但他們總是幾倍利錢的，所謂　市當三年，買不買是無問題的，祗要你肯還價！</p>
<p>他們的貨物底來源是說不定的！百貨公司的貨物是向外國洋行裏定下來的，雜貨店裏的貨品，是向批發所駁下來的；但摩囉街的複雜到分不開新與舊好或醜的零星雜物，它的來源就有些「莫測高深」！他們　收買吧，誠然，我們在里弄　很常聽見到『收買　銅爛鐡』的叫喊，收買者，原來也是破收買人的！他們有一部分為賣到摩羅街來的，不過，不必盡然，營骨董或舊料的老板，妙在其中，他們另有所謂『夜冷』的　法，和所謂「出當』的手段，此外更有抽大煙的不肖子孫，把先人遺物偷到道裏來！　之，花樣儘管繁多，其「平收　買」則一。</p>
<p>就這樣的支撐了一二十年，維持了數口之家，總要識貨，够眼光，我們常會　到一件古物，所謂稀奇珍寶，使骨董舖或　料　，賺到幾百幾千槐錢的。</p>
<p>街是窄而帶着斜坡的，沒有崔峨的洋樓，寬敞的大廈，只是一層一層，中國式的店舖，除了三一，間算是比較有些規模的，注重窻飾的而外，其餘則亳無秩序，與條理，地下，門口，卓上，或者是櫃架裏，都堆滿了東西——熨斗，帝聲機　絨球，爛球拍，尤其是各式各樣五花八門的自來水筆，</p>
<p>黃昏近了，　計們把電燈都按苦了，不够亮吧，他們　得燃點了小　煤汽燈，遊街的人，一羣一隊地擁現馬路兩旁，也有從堅道落山的，也有從　里活上山的。定過摩囉街，一部分停住了　，有穿絲髮長衫的有閒者，有咬着雪茄的紳士，年紀老些的，對着他心目中所要　的東西發呆從討價還價中充分的表露他玩骨董的經騐，是國內的官僚政客吧，什麼『家風』『門第一的話都說出來了，的確，他們是從百年老城裏逃來的！啊，祖國的『功名』『富貴』都給帶來了！門第家風，功名富貴，封建的遣留，配合了資本的殘餘勢力，這骨董舖之所以為骨董舖，舊料攤之所以為舊料　！</p>
<p>百分之五六的西人也常來遊摩囉街的，是水兵　樣的，他們在揀買殘舊的白斜黃斜衣褲。軍人穿舊了的皮　皮靴等，他們也會買去的。他們若然楚夫婦，則多數是鎖到骨董舖東去談談說說的。老板們為了「做生意」，幾乎每間舖　都得用一二名會說英語的伙計。雖不得　答如流，但『One　Doller』之類是總還應付得過去。</p>
<p>聞　今年舊暦過年，骨董利市百倍，是的，香港難民多，高等的，他們把當年在南京夫子　廣洲文德路　買骨董，點綴『新年』的精神，都移向摩囉街來了！</p>

<h3>How Should England, France, and America Deal with the Tianjin Incident?</h3>
<p>The Japanese army's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin has intensified daily. The fundamental aim of the Japanese is, as we commented before, nothing more than to threaten England and France into abandoning their policy of aiding China in resisting Japan, and to suppress our country's war of resistance activities and propaganda. The Japanese spokesman in Tianjin has already declared: "Even if the British hand over the four Chinese, it will not solve the current problem, because the purpose of the blockade is to obtain broader cooperation from the British authorities in China." And this so-called cooperation is no more than the demands previously made by Japan to Britain: "Britain should assist Japan in building a new order in East Asia" (as revealed by the London "Daily Mail"). In other words, it is demanding that Britain help Japan drive out the Americans and French in order to let the "superman" Japanese Empire dominate East Asia. Sima Zhao's intentions are plain to all. If one mistakenly believes that the Tianjin incident is a local incident and attempts to settle it through compromise, there will be endless troubles. This point, most British public opinion and politicians who understand the current situation in Japan have already discussed clearly, and the British authorities cannot be ignorant of it. The most important issue now is how England, France, and America should deal with this serious situation.</p>
<p>The first way for England to deal with Japan's overall offensive strategy is to have a thorough understanding, a firm attitude, and agile means. Since the Japanese side has declared that the Tianjin incident is not a local incident, but rather requires Britain to fundamentally change its basic policy towards the Sino-Japanese War, then what is needed now is strength. Only by not compromising with Japan and acting independently can one seize the opportunity to act decisively. Some British people worry that a strong confrontation with Japan will lead to an armed conflict between England and Japan, escalating into an Anglo-Japanese war. But this is an overestimation. It must be known that internal contradictions within Japan are also numerous. The opinion of Japan expanding conflicts with third countries is no longer the mainstream. The reason why Japanese troops abroad are acting recklessly is only to suppress this anti-war mainstream. Therefore, if Britain can be firm to the end, it will not be difficult for the Japanese army to soften.</p>
<p>England cannot merely pay lip service in dealing with Japan's recklessness, nor can it remain in deliberation forever. The most important thing now is how to implement effective and powerful measures. The first and most effective step is economic sanctions: declaring the cancellation of the preferential treatment enjoyed by Japan, preventing people from using British land to transport Japanese goods or counterfeit Japanese goods, prohibiting the export of all resources to Japan, further maintaining legal tender to打击 Japanese currency and counterfeit currency, and prohibiting Japanese ships from entering and exiting British ports, etc. The value of these methods lies in their early implementation, so that Japan, mired in the mud, immediately feels the danger of animosity with England.</p>
<p>Third, England must cooperate effectively with France and America, and France and America should also be aware of this. America cannot merely mediate and pretend to be a bystander watching from across the river. France cannot sit idly by while other countries are in trouble and their sovereignty is violated, such as the incident on the 14th when Japanese troops actually broke into the French defense line and arrested an American photographer from the American film company 20th Century Fox. In fact, the US authorities have already acknowledged: "The treaty rights enjoyed by England, France, and America in China are largely the same. When the interests of England and France in Tianjin are harmed, the interests of the United States are also similarly harmed." Paris also advocates that England and France can simultaneously implement a blockade of commercial ports, prohibiting Japanese merchant ships from using them."</p>
<p>The Tianjin incident is the prelude to the Japanese seizing all concessions and forcing England, France, and America out. England, France, and America need to be more thoroughly aware!</p>
<p>Shanxi Correspondence</p>
<h3>Arriving at the Rear of the × Army</h3>
<p>On January 14th, we crossed the river at Rongzekou near Zhengzhou. On the opposite bank, a company of ××× Army brothers came to welcome us.</p>
<p>For a month, we freely walked on the land of Hebei, from northern Henan to the sixth district of Shandong, through southern Hebei, we arrived at eastern Hebei. We passed through Yuanwu, Yangwu, Puyang, Guantao, Qinghe, Zaoqiang, Wuyi, Wuqiang and other counties. On February 6th, we met the general headquarters in a village near Raoyang.</p>
<p>Now, our regular work has been going on for more than ten days.</p>
<p>During the march, walking seventy or eighty li a day was considered very ordinary to us. Every comrade's steps were very vigorous. From the cold morning at five o'clock to the dim evening at six or seven o'clock, these were the times when we breathed and sang in the wilderness. At night, we slept on the ground dried with hay. There were no window panes. The night wind caressed our arms and faces. We fell asleep with our clothes on. Fatigue quickly sent us into a sweet dream. Millet rice and cold steamed buns were our favorite food. There was no hope of eating vegetables. This kind of nutrition, this kind of life, made us stronger day by day.</p>
<p>The roads have been destroyed. But we still formed a long line and marched. The blood-red sun shone on our python leaping forward on the North China Plain. We were happy to let the singing echo in the wilderness and the morning sky.</p>
<p>Every village has a self-defense army guarding with guns. Every village has our troops stationed there. (The troops of the × Route Army, the Shi Legion, and Ding Shuben) Many slogans, posters, newspapers, and leaflets that cannot be seen in the rear are posted everywhere and distributed everywhere. On the loess walls, white slogans are brushed:</p>
<p>"Reasonable Burden!"</p>
<p>"Consolidate the United Front!"</p>
<p>We felt unusually happy. Every time we passed through a village, the local farmers prepared boiled water in advance to comfort us, and drew water from the wells for us to drink for the horses. Whether it was the elderly or the young children, they greeted us kindly:</p>
<p>"Comrades! Take a rest!"</p>
<p>"Are you hungry!"</p>
<p>Once, when passing through a village, two villagers reluctantly sent us to the head of the village, standing there for a long time, cherishing our backs.</p>
<p>We are welcomed everywhere. Several times, the farmers all held small paper flags with the slogans "Welcome the ××× Army!" "Welcome the Battlefield Service Corps," etc. to greet us. We felt as close as if we had returned to our hometown. Although time did not permit us to do so, we still took the time to work. During the time after dinner before going to bed every day when we stayed in the village, we spent all our time on propaganda and visits. Occasionally, we also held discussion meetings with armed comrades who were traveling with us to discuss current affairs and various questions.</p>
<p>In Wuyi and Zaoqiang and other places, we used the evening time to perform plays. When performing in Wuqiang, because the audience was too crowded and excited, the stage was pushed down. This time, the actors and the audience on stage really fought into one piece. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<p>We are welcomed everywhere: as soon as we arrived in Zaoqiang, the political department of Wuyi called us to make an appointment; and specially sent someone to greet us. Here, we should boast to you that we were well received and ate a lot of meat. We were very happy: we didn't feel that this was the rear of the × people. We felt that it was more free and lively than the rear of the motherland. The environment in all aspects made us feel satisfied and excited! Similarly, all places urgently need a large number of cadres. The patriotic youths in the cities - the young students in the rear, the front needs you! The front is happy!</p>
<p>Here, we heard the valuable instructions of ×× Division Commander and Commander Lü Zhengcao. Those steel sentences touched every one of our comrades and further strengthened our belief in working behind the enemy lines. When we performed the play, they also took the time to watch it in the midst of their busy military affairs. At the same time, they were angry and even shed tears because of the development of the plot.</p>
<p>Another point that is worthy of our special emphasis to report to you is that now we are completely living in the war. The × people are recently stepping up the "sweeping" of the guerrilla areas in North China, especially in central Hebei. Because of strategic reasons, many small towns have been automatically abandoned. We have indeed achieved the "firm wall clearing field" strategy of exhausting the × people. Fierce battles are being played everywhere.</p>
<p>We can often hear deafening cannon fire and gunfire. Once, we were only ten li away from the × people, but we did not have any fear. We firmly believed in the courage of our combat troops. At the same time. We more scientifically believe that our proactive strategy of retreating in order to advance will be victorious. Therefore, we are still active in various troops in various villages. When writing a letter, the sound of guns and cannons is reverberating in the area about twenty li to the south, but we are safely rehearsing the play!</p>
<p>Work is calling us, making us unable to make more meaningful reports to you. Due to the urgency of time, many things that are worth talking to you individually or in detail cannot be remembered for a while. Let it end like this!</p>
<p>We are worried that this letter will not be found by the × people and will not be safely delivered to you?</p>
<p>Bless you with successful work!</p>
<p>Please come to the front, the front needs you!</p>
<p>(Zhou Pengcheng)</p>

<h3>The Jin War is Fierce and the Overall Situation is Stable. After the Defeat in Shandong, a Larger Battle Will Begin. Our Army in Guangdong and Jiangxi is Still in an Active Position</h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from Xi'an on the 16th by This Newspaper] The enemy in western Shanxi has adopted a defensive posture, and the fighting situation is silent. The enemy at Fenghlingdu in southern Shanxi resumed shelling the south bank on the morning of the 15th. After our counterattack, many enemies were killed. Both eastern Henan and northern Henan are calm. The guerrilla warfare in Hebei Province has also been fierce recently.</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from Chongqing on the 16th by This Newspaper] According to a telegram from Shandong, the enemy who launched a large-scale invasion of southeastern Shandong has been severely attacked by us for several days, with heavy casualties. Their offensive has been exhausted, but they are still actively increasing their forces, hoping to launch another fierce attack. It is expected that a major battle will begin again within a few days. Our XXX units have all attacked into the enemy's rear, and the enemy will control it.</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from Guilin on the 16th by This Newspaper] There is no change in the war situation in South China. We are in an active position in Guangdong and Jiangxi, and constantly harass the enemy. There are occasional artillery sounds in the suburbs of Guangzhou and Nanchang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengkou, 15th] On the morning of the 15th, the enemy first launched a fierce artillery attack on the north of Luoshedu, followed by two or three hundred enemy infantry attacking. Our army has sent troops to meet the attack, and the fierce battle is still going on.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 15th] Our army attacked the old San Shui Xin Hengjiao Kou on the 14th. The enemy retreated to Ge Wei. After our army burned down the enemy camp, they returned to their original defense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 14th] A certain unit of our army encountered forty or fifty puppet Mongolian troops near Wu and Shan. After two hours of fierce fighting, twenty-one enemies were killed and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition were captured. We suffered no casualties. The power poles between Guyang Dayushutan and Baotou have now been completely destroyed by us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuliang, 15th] Our artillery troops again damaged an enemy transport ship at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, 15th] An enemy train was driving through Jianshan, three li west of Yanglousi, at 1:00 p.m. on the 15th, when it hit our landmine. The locomotive and five military vehicles were all destroyed. More than a hundred enemy soldiers carried in them were all crushed to death, and two cars were also crushed.</p>
<p>The Enemy Army in Southern Shanxi Scurries Eastward, Pinglu and Bajin are Turned into Scorched Earth</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 15th] The enemy in southern Shanxi launched a large-scale dramatic invasion before. After our strenuous resistance, the enemy shifted its target and scurried to our eastern route. More than 3,000 enemies from Dakuan Village on the morning of the 13th were divided into two groups, one scurrying to Dongxi Yancun (east of Maojin) and the other scurrying to Ji Wanggu Wang (northeast of Maojin). They briefly engaged in battle with our army. The enemy invaded our position four times and were all repelled. The fierce battle continued until noon, and because our casualties were heavy, we shifted our front and continued to fight east of Ji Wang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 15th] After Pinglu and Maojin were successively recovered, a reporter from the Central News Agency rushed to inspect them. In Pingjiang County, except for two county government buildings and the Qian Guan Man Mansion, the rest was turned into scorched earth. Broken tiles and ruined walls were unbearable to look at. The reason is that the enemy invaded Zhongtiao Mountain last time, and our army and civilians cooperated to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. The enemy was abnormally angry and vented its anger on our people. This time Pinglu fell into the hands of the enemy, and the enemy wantonly burned and killed. As of when the reporter entered the city, the embers were still not extinguished. The enemy also indiscriminately killed our compatriots in the four suburbs. They once captured more than a thousand of our people in Hewan Village and gathered them in the valley. The enemy looked down from a high position and strafed with machine guns. The corpses were piled up like mountains. The cruelty of the enemy was appalling. Although Maodu was not burned, the enemy planes repeatedly exploded, and most of the bombs dropped were Yi bombs. The entire town was no different from a ruin.</p>
<p>The Remaining Enemy in Western Shanxi has been Cleared, and Order has been Restored in Liulin Military Ferry</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 15th] A person from the military ferry said that the enemy suffered more than a thousand casualties in this western invasion. The battle was fierce, which was unprecedented in Yingxi. After being injured, Regiment Commander Gao still supervised his troops and bravely charged and killed. Regiment Commander Tang took the lead and died for the country. Although our army suffered losses, its fighting spirit has chilled the enemy's courage. When the enemy invaded Liulin Military Ferry, they were affected by our firm wall clearing, and had no food or drink. They vented their anger on the people and burned almost half of the houses in Liulin. More than a dozen planes repeatedly bombed various villages, and the people suffered heavy casualties. After our army regained the Liulin Military Ferry, the refugees have returned to their hometowns one after another. Now order and traffic have been restored, and the remaining enemies nearby have also been completely cleared by us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Somewhere in western Shanxi, 15th] The enemy has continued to increase in Tu Dou Heilongguan and Dong Wang (northeast of Fencheng) and other places in the east of the Lvliang Mountains. At about 3:00 a.m. on the 14th, the enemy from Shimen was divided into two groups and advanced westward from Hongliangtang Zhaodongxi Ying (southwest of Shimen). The enemy from Heilongguan passed through Nan Jinlinan Long and attacked the Pillow (west of Linfen) area. Our army is currently in Dongzhuang Xizhuang Nan Jinli and other nearby areas, and is engaged in mixed warfare with the enemy. At the same time, more than 200 enemy infantry and cavalry from Xiwang attached 6 artillery pieces and shelled Pan Road dozens of times at dawn on the 14th, then moved to Donghou Village, and scurried to Foe Er Yai Ai at 8:00 a.m., where they were met by our army guarding the dangerous terrain. After a fierce battle for an hour, the enemy failed and collapsed eastward.</p>
<h3>Two Ways to Die: Soldier Xu Zhong is Heavier than Mount Tai, Li Tianzhu is Lighter than a Feather</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 15th] Xu Zu, a soldier in a certain unit of our army, was sent to Tongkou, Zhongxiang, the previous month to go deep into the enemy's nest. Unfortunately, he was arrested and subjected to cruel torture by the enemy. Soldier Xu always adhered to the determination to die rather than be humiliated and strictly guarded the military secrets of our army. Finally, his body was completely dismembered and he was escorted to the execution ground by the enemy and executed. Before his death, Soldier Xu shouted slogans such as supporting the leader and killing all the enemy bandits. The general public was moved to tears, and the enemy bandits also sighed. They were buried with honors and a tombstone of an anonymous hero was erected in front of the tomb.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Li Tianzhu, who was assassinated on the morning of the 14th, was shot four times. Although he was treated, he died on the morning of the 15th due to his serious injuries. (It is said that Li attached himself to Wang Ni and served as the Minister of the Shanghai Municipal Mobilization Association)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai News At 11:40 p.m. on the 14th, a person named Zhao Xing was shot in Room 19 of Changshun Hotel, Zhijiang Road, Dongxin Bridge, and was shot three times. He was seriously injured. According to the investigation by the Concession Police Department, Zhao was a spy for the enemy army after August 13 and served as a secret agent in the puppet municipal government's detective team. This time, he was shot, and he claimed that it was a vendetta.</p>
<h3>Min Province Conscripts Voluntarily Enlist</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 15th] Many Min province conscripts voluntarily enlisted. In order to encourage good men to enlist and kill the enemy, the Provincial Anti-Japanese Association issued a bonus of ten yuan per person. At present, 113 people from Fuqing, 4 people from Minqing, 1 person from Datian, 2 people from Jian'ou, 18 people from Fuding, 50 people from Xiapu, 6 people from Sandu, 7 people from Hui'an, 16 people from Changting, 112 people from Minhou, 11 people from Daitian, 2 people from Yongtai, 1 person from Qingliu, 237 people from Fu'an, 2 people from Yujiang, and 2 people from Shanghang, totaling 594 people, have been approved and given awards.

<h3>Li Hanhun Cables the Country, Supporting Severe Punishment of Internal Traitors, Enemy Plans to Have Wang Take the Stage on July 7 to Act in Concert, Wang Ni's Accomplices Intimidate Chinese and Foreign Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Peiping, 16th] According to reliable Chinese sources, Wang Kemin, Chairman of the Puppet "Provisional Government Administrative Committee," has submitted his resignation at the beginning of this week, but it has not been approved. The reason for the resignation is weak and ill. However, those who are well-informed say that the biggest reason is that the Japanese intend to use Wang Jingwei as a puppet to replace Wang Kemin. Wang Jingwei's representative is very active here. The Japanese side hopes to announce the reorganization of the puppet government on July 7, the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, or to form it in a new federal manner.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Wang Ni shamelessly attached himself to the enemy, and the National Government has already issued an order to arrest him. Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has cabled the whole country to express his support for the order to arrest Wang and bring him to justice. He said that Wang Ni's attachment to the enemy is abandoned by the Chinese people and intolerable by national law. Now the National Government has ordered the arrest of Wang and will bring him to justice in order to uphold the law and satisfy the people's hearts. He respectfully leads 35 million Guangdong people to support it unanimously.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai News Staff members of various foreign and Chinese newspapers received a threatening letter on the morning of the 15th, signed by the Special Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang for Eradicating Communists and Saving the Country, prohibiting them from undermining the peace movement and opposing Wang, otherwise they would be executed. The letter was about 500 words long and was absurd in its wording. At first glance, it was a boring act by Wang's accomplices, so everyone laughed it off.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai News The Shanghai Daily News said in an editorial on the 14th that Wang Jingwei's recent peace proposals cannot exceed his previous remarks, and it can be asserted that Wang's recent peace proposals will not exceed his previous remarks. At a time when the invading Japanese army is deeply mired in the quagmire and unable to advance or retreat, Wang's meaningless appeal will be ignored by Chongqing. From the past twenty-three months of combat experience, Japan should now admit that the Chinese people cannot be subdued and that China's vast territory is difficult to occupy completely. From a political point of view, Japan's ambitions in China have also failed, because the Japanese army has not yet obtained a reputable Chinese in its occupied areas who is willing to assume the responsibility of being a puppet, restoring peace and maintaining law and order. Even if Wang is valued by the Japanese and appointed as the leader of the puppet government, it may be difficult to win the support of the general public.</p>
<h3>Special Correspondence from This Newspaper: A Journey to Luofu (3)</h3>
<p>— A Firefly</p>
<p>The Cleanliness of the Sha River Should Be Preserved</p>
<p>When I woke up in the morning, the weather was still gloomy, but since it wasn't raining, we followed our decision from last night and went to Changning to have breakfast. At six o'clock, we packed up and set off, heading along the small road. We ran along the narrow rice paddies for about five li before reaching the waterside, the northwest bank of the Paosha River, where we were going to cross.</p>
<p>The waters of the Sha River were murky, probably due to the rain. One or two small boats drifted down from the upper reaches. From the cabins at the stern of the boats, smoke from the stoves rose. Judging by these circumstances, these boats were undoubtedly preparing for a long journey. I curiously asked the ferryman: "Why? During these times of military tension, are boats like these still allowed to sail downstream into the occupied territories of the × people?" "Lots of them, these boats are just the thing for making money," the ferryman said very naturally.</p>
<p>After hearing this from the ferryman, I felt uneasy. Like a hungry wolf hearing the bleating of a lamb, I pressed the ferryman and the other passengers for details about this "making money."</p>
<p>It turned out that the × people had recently been using traitors to do business on a large scale in Shilong, buying up food supplies at high prices and selling enemy goods at cheap prices. Grain that only cost four or five yuan in Hongshi, Boluo, was worth fourteen to sixteen yuan in Shishi, while chickens costing one hundred yuan per dan in Boluo were worth two hundred and forty yuan in Shilong. Transporting matches, cigarettes, and cloth from Shilong to the interior could yield a profit of two times the cost. As a result, traitorous merchants were quietly active, intentionally or unintentionally helping the × people with their food supply. So the boats on the waterways were busy, and the peddlers on the roads were busy too. The Sha River had become a blood vessel supplying the × people who were suffering from anemia.</p>
<p>The situation was rather serious. The Sha River was a small river running through the abdomen of Boluo. Wooden boats could sail directly from Xiangshui, under Elephant Head Mountain, to Gang, Longhua, Jiutan, Dongbo, and then to Shilong. As such, during these times, every boat that passed was benefiting the × people and making the war of resistance more difficult. (After Magistrate Huang and Commander Luo learned of this situation, they immediately sealed off the river and started to pay attention to political work along the river, eventually capturing several traitors. This was the most exciting thing for us to witness - the words within the symbols were added when the manuscript was being edited, and things were indeed different when we crossed the Sha River compared to now).</p>
<p>Now the local authorities are stepping up the work of purging traitors. The compatriots of Boluo should preserve the cleanliness of the Sha River and not allow the traitors to pollute it.</p>
<h3>The Situation in the British and French Concessions in Tianjin After the Blockade</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Tianjin Foreign Dispatch: Yesterday was the second day of the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. The situation within the concessions has not seen any particularly surprising developments. The major events of yesterday included: (1) Inciters attempted to instigate a crowd of 2,000 people to rush into the British concession, but the attempt failed; (2) Incendiary leaflets were again distributed in the former German concession, now under Japanese control; (3) Several foreign ships were intercepted and searched by the Japanese. The food situation within the concessions has further deteriorated and has become a serious problem. Although the Japanese claim that food can be freely imported into the concessions, only a very small amount of vegetables, meat, and beef entered the area in the past two days. The inventory in the markets is almost sold out. There have also been instances of hoarding and speculation to profit from the situation, with prices of various goods rising by 25% to 70%. Only the price of canned goods has slightly increased. According to eyewitnesses, yesterday some villagers were allowed to transport vegetables to the edge of the concession in earth carts. There, Japanese troops had erected barbed wire and obstacles, but no Japanese soldiers were stationed there. So the sellers held the vegetables high above the obstacles, and the residents of the concession competed to buy them, which was quite amusing. Yesterday, the instigators who attempted to get the crowd to rush into the British concession first had some people line up, preparing to rush into the concession along Racecourse Road. The instigators gave speeches to them, urging them to rush to the concession's defense line. However, a company of British infantry, carrying machine guns, quickly arrived and took strict precautions. At that point, the crowd lost its desire to rush into the concession, and the instigators' attempt failed. By 3 p.m., the crowd had dispersed, and the British troops also withdrew at 3:30 p.m. Yesterday, some Chinese police officers in uniform were discovered in the former German concession, distributing leaflets with inflammatory content. Some of the leaflets were blown by the wind into the British concession and near the French concession. There were also people distributing five-colored leaflets, the content of which was to incite the people to take actions against the concessions. There were some slogans on the top of the leaflets, the most prominent of which were: "Chinese people should immediately leave the British and French concessions," "The British concession is a hotbed of communism," and "The day the women return to the concessions will be the day the unrest ends." Yesterday, several foreign ships were searched by the Japanese, including the "Haiping," flying the Danish flag. The ship left Tianjin in the early morning, but was detained at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf for five hours. It was allowed to leave only after a thorough search by the Japanese. In the afternoon, two cargo ships were detained at the same wharf by the Japanese while unloading goods. The goods inside were all opened and inspected. The chief mate protested, saying that the goods had been sealed by customs and should not be re-examined. The goods on board originally belonged to a German merchant, so the shipowner has reported to the German merchant, who in turn will ask the German consul for assistance. Yesterday, two small ships sailed to Tanggu after being searched by the Japanese. A French ship chartered by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. arrived here yesterday afternoon. The ship was detained at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf, and inspectors spent fifteen minutes checking it. This was the first foreign ship to arrive in Tianjin since the Japanese blockade of the concessions. Also, on the first day of the Japanese blockade, some foreigners were insulted, but no accidents occurred. The sentries paid close attention to British and French nationals. Some British and French nationals were detained by them and questioned in detail. The cars they came in were also thoroughly searched, resulting in delays of up to an hour. Some British gentlemen were forced to take off their shoes and socks during the search, expressing anger. It is said that the Japanese authorities also interrogate Japanese residents who attempt to go to the concessions. However, the Japanese residents and German and Italian residents receive ultimately more lenient treatment. Although incidents of German women being searched also occurred twice. Russian women had to show their identity cards registered with the Anti-Communist Committee in Tianjin before being searched. The work of interrogating women was done by women. Yesterday, several incidents involving British residents occurred, mostly caused by Japanese soldiers during searches. The incidents mainly involved British residents being forced to take off their clothes for inspection. Sometimes the searches lasted so long that they became unbearable. Generally speaking, British residents have not moved out of the concessions unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3>Japan's Uncompromising Stance on the Tianjin Concession Issue; Claims It Will Seize All Foreign Concessions in China; Japanese Newspapers Launch Frenzied Attacks on Sir Archibald Clark Kerr</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] It is reported that the Japanese Cabinet today decided to support the actions taken by the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin and agreed to promptly implement the Japanese government's established policies. This step was decided after the cabinet members received a report from Minister of War Itagaki, which stated that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin had taken all appropriate measures "with firm and resolute attitude." Foreign Minister Arita reported to the cabinet that the British authorities in Tianjin had requested an explanation regarding the public announcement of the blockade of the concession issued by the commander of the Japanese army there. Official reports from Tianjin have not yet been received, but the incident should be handled locally. I have asked the British government to take a cautious attitude and cooperate with Japan to seek a permanent solution. According to a Tianjin dispatch from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the conditions for Japan to lift the blockade are as follows: (1) Britain and Japan should jointly investigate and suppress anti-Japanese terrorists in the concession; (2) Britain should immediately cease its economic intervention in North China; (3) 50 million yuan deposited in Chinese banks within the concession should be handed over to the Japanese. It is said that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have decided to continue the blockade of the concession until the above conditions are implemented.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Yesterday, Minister of War Itagaki and Foreign Minister Arita successively reported to the cabinet on the Tianjin incident. It is said that the Japanese government has decided to continue blockading the concession until the concession authorities formally recognize the "New Order in North China." If Britain takes retaliatory measures, Japan will respond with a plan. As for foreign propaganda claiming that the United States will act as a mediator, people here have not been able to confirm this information. The Japanese public has expressed support for the government's current policies, and there have been countless telegrams from Korea demanding that the government not concede. The Japanese press is also demanding that the blockade of the concession continue until the concession issue is fundamentally resolved. According to the Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, speaking to a reporter from Domei News Agency in Shenyang, the issue of foreign concessions in China can be completely resolved. The issue of returning the concessions will be resolved after the establishment of the future "Central Government of China," but the administrative structure of the concessions must be reorganized now.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] On Friday, all Japanese newspapers unanimously supported the actions of the Japanese military, saying that the British ambassador must bear the responsibility for the Japanese military's blockade of the Tianjin public concession. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr can no longer represent his government; he is actually an advisor to the National Government. The current situation has become so serious entirely because of his fault. The Asahi Shimbun also reported that the British proposal for mediation came too late and was completely unsatisfactory to the Japanese side. It also said that a fundamental solution is extremely difficult unless the British government abandons its interests in Tianjin and recognizes the new situation in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Order from the National Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The National Government issued an order on the 16th: (1) Appoint Hu Zhongmin as the Secretary-General of the Hubei Provincial Provisional Assembly; (2) Appoint Zhao Zhen as the Secretary-General of the Gansu Provincial Provisional Assembly.</p>
<h3>Foreigners in Beidaihe × Also Planned to Be Harassed; Britain Considering Sending Warship to Protect</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 16th] It is learned that the Japanese authorities have ordered that a household registration survey be conducted on all foreigners in Beidaihe, a famous summer resort in North China. There are many people vacationing in Beidaihe. Before the blockade of the Tianjin concession, a large number of women also went there. It is rumored that the Japanese are planning to take some actions against the British residents there, but this news has not yet been confirmed. It is also learned that the British authorities are now considering sending a destroyer to Beidaihe to protect the British residents there.</p>
<h3>Two People Crossing the Blockade Shot × to Death; Situation in Tianjin Becomes Tense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 16th] It is reported that two Chinese men, carrying vegetable baskets, crossed the blockade of the British concession this morning and were arrested by the Japanese military and executed as a "warning to others." After this incident, the situation here has become even more tense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Tianjin Foreign Dispatch: After the agitators failed to enter the concession yesterday morning, the British troops guarding the border of the concession immediately withdrew. Ten minutes later, a company of Japanese infantry, led by a Japanese officer on horseback, rushed to the border near the British concession, carrying machine guns.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei and Doihara</h3>
<p>— Xia Yan</p>
<p>When talking about Japanese special agencies in China, one will think of Doihara. This Lawrence of the Far East indeed left too deep an impression on Chinese people. Therefore, since Wang Jingwei left Chongqing, the rumors about Wang Jingwei and Doihara have never stopped. The most widespread saying in Shanghai about Wang Jingwei's whereabouts also says that Wang took a Japanese warship to Shanghai on the afternoon of April 12 and stayed on the 16th floor of the Broadway Mansions. He met with Doihara that day and visited the French ambassador in the French Concession the next day. This is also "an example" of people regarding Doihara as a symbol of Japanese special agencies. In fact, Doihara was not in Shanghai in mid-April. He left Shanghai on March 14 and had already been transferred to Heihe to serve as the garrison commander. The reason for his transfer was closely related to the Wang Jingwei issue. To put it bluntly, Doihara had conflicts of opinion with Minister Itagaki on the Wang Jingwei issue. His transfer was a kind of punishment. In the most recent stage, at least, it can be said that Doihara has already "fallen from grace."</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's direct involvement with Japanese special agencies occurred before the abandonment of Wuhan. This is well known. Initially, it was Gao Zongwu who went to Japan, but he did not contact Doihara. Instead, he contacted Kagesa, the chief of the military affairs section of the Ministry of War. In mid-September, Kagesa, accompanied by Ima-i, the head of the China Section of the General Staff Headquarters, came to Hong Kong to discuss further cooperation with Wang's representatives. This negotiation was, of course, carried out with Itagaki's consent. At the end of October, Guangzhou and Wuhan fell. The initial plan of the Japanese special agency was for Wang Jingwei to escape from Chongqing and fly to Guangzhou to establish a government. However, this approach seemed too reckless, partly due to Wang's own hesitation and partly due to Gu XXX's opposition, so it could not be realized. Therefore, the second plan was: Wang Jingwei would find a way to go abroad to "recuperate" in France, where he was accustomed to living. Japan specially appointed Tani Masayuki as the ambassador to France, unobtrusively discussing the establishment of a new government and the issue of contacting "the two philosophers," Hitler and Mussolini. However, Tani Masayuki's appointment to France was superficially rejected by the French government because Tani Masayuki had anti-French remarks in Shanghai. This plan also fell through. Whether the French government knew about such a conspiracy in advance and rejected Tani's "agreement," we have no way of knowing. However, Wang Jingwei and Japanese special agents had these two proposals. One only needs to flip through the old newspapers of last year to find news of "a certain important person being sent to Europe" around that time, plus the report of Tani Masayuki's appointment to France being rejected, to issue a knowing smile.</p>
<p>"United front" doesn't seem to have been established among several giants of the Japanese army's business affairs. This transaction with Wang Jingwei which Minister Itagaki and Kagesa are actively pursuing, kept absolute secret from Doihara, who is considered the Lawrence of the Far East. When Kagesa was most aggressively pursuing Wang, Doihara was working on another target. Doihara had put in a lot of effort to get Tang XXX to become the chief puppet in South and Central China, but it failed. The elderly man was buried under the axe of a young Guangdong man. After Doihara lost Tang XXX, he suddenly put all his efforts into another target, which was the scene of supporting Wu (Peifu) to come out of retirement in North China.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's open telegram had a stronger impact on Doihara than anyone else. Such a big conspiracy was not made known to him at all. This was obviously a kind of distrust and insult to him. He was an opponent of the "Wang Jingwei theory." He was more determined than anyone else to use someone from the opposition party to clean up the situation. Therefore, in the aspect of special work of the Japanese army, two opposing camps were formed: Doihara and his system, who advocated supporting (using) Wu, and Itagaki, Kagesa, and Tojo, who advocated using Wang. These two factions had a fierce dispute at the military conference convened in Tokyo in mid-February. At the "Military Cadres Conference" held in Shanghai in March, the dispute even escalated into a melee of bare swords. Opinions were divided at the Military Cadres Conference. The most激烈的 one led by Prince Chichibu opposed any and all mid-way peace talks, opposed "employing" Wang Jingwei. The Doihara faction argued aggressively that Wang Jingwei and XXX had an understanding. Using Wang would make it impossible to "destroy the party." However, the Kagesa-Tojo faction believed that Doihara's understanding of China had already "fallen behind the times" and was not suitable for the current China. At that time, Doihara and the young officers joined forces in opposing the use of Wang, demanding that they return to the country to thoroughly liquidate the military in China. The situation was extremely tense. The news of this "melee of bare swords" reached Tokyo. Itagaki was afraid that the situation would escalate, so he ordered Okamura Yasuji to take emergency measures, transferring Doihara to be the commander of the Heihe garrison, effectively depriving him of his right to speak in Central and South China. To vent his anger, Doihara instructed Kazuo (the well-known Little Doihara) to leak the secret of the Wang Jingwei-Hiranuma pact. Kazuo leaked this secret to a Chinese person named Xie, and thus the "Wang-Hiranuma Agreement" was revealed in the Chongqing newspapers.</p>
<p>The invincible Lawrence of the Far East is having an unlucky period this year, perhaps because he has been too successful in the past and made too many enemies. In Central China, he has no base. The puppet Shanghai Municipal Government is the sphere of influence of the navy. The guy Betto no longer buys his bills. What about the "Reformed Government"? Kusumoto is close to Kagesa. What about the old base of North China? Kita Seiichi has also grown his wings and wants to stand against him. If Doihara in Heihe could see the telegram of "Wang and Doihara's meeting at Jiang XXX's Ye Garden on April 12," he might not be able to help but give a lonely wry smile.

<h3>Tianjin: Search of British Nationals; British Protest; Chamberlain Issues Strong Statement; Britain, France, and the United States Maintain Close Contact</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Regarding the incident of Japanese authorities searching British nationals in Tianjin and forcibly boarding a British tugboat, the British government has lodged a protest but has not yet received a reply. Although the British government is maintaining close contact with the U.S. and French governments through diplomatic channels, it has not discussed possible retaliatory measures with the U.S. government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated at a reception for the press today that Washington, London, Paris, and Tokyo are currently exchanging opinions on the Tianjin issue. However, he is unaware of any possible joint action by the U.S., Britain, and France. Hull also mentioned that when he issued a statement on the 14th, he said that the U.S. representative in Tianjin would strive to clarify the situation in Tianjin to the fullest extent possible. At that time, he meant that the U.S. representative would act as an intermediary if possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the Tianjin situation in the House of Commons today. He stated that the British garrison authorities have taken all meticulous steps to maintain order in the concession, and the British warship "Rover" is docked at the embankment of the British concession. British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has lodged a detailed protest with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and has been instructed to point out to the Japanese government the danger of the Japanese provocative actions in Tianjin, stating that they could lead to regrettable events. Craigie also urged the Japanese side to pay attention to the seriousness of the recent statement by a Japanese spokesperson in Tianjin that even if the British side extradited the four Chinese, it would not solve the current problem, as the purpose of the blockade was to obtain greater cooperation from the British authorities in China. The Prime Minister continued, saying that if such a statement represents the views of the Tokyo authorities, it is clear that Japan intends to use this incident to make broader and more significant demands than the extradition of the four Chinese. Such demands would inevitably raise serious policy issues and would affect the relations of other powers no less than Britain. Therefore, Britain is currently maintaining the closest contact with the U.S. and French governments. At the same time, the British government is considering the situation caused by the Japanese side's refusal to organize a review committee and the continued blockade of the Tianjin concession. Labour Party MP Henderson then asked whether the British government was prepared to invoke Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty, which stipulates that in the event of a situation arising that conflicts with the principles of the treaty, the signatory countries should consult in detail on how to deal with it. Chamberlain replied that the situation is obviously serious, and the British government is considering it from all aspects, but he is not yet prepared to announce what actions the British government has decided to take.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Labour Party MP Adams will question Chamberlain in the House of Commons on June 19 as to whether the British government, in view of the serious implications of the fundamental principles of national establishment, is prepared to maintain the inviolability of the British concession in Tianjin.</p>
<p>The British Government is Considering Implementing Retaliatory Measures</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, sources close to the government here declared that the British cabinet is waiting two or three days to see if Japan will change its current attitude. If it remains stubborn, Britain will retaliate against Japan economically, and the first step will be to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911. After the most-favored-nation clauses stipulated in this treaty are abolished, import duties on Japanese goods can be raised in an appropriate manner and the quantity of Japanese imports can be restricted. The government has this intention, and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Sir Inskip, has notified the High Commissioners of the various dominions stationed in London today. The Ministry of Commerce is preparing a report on economic retaliatory measures, which will be submitted to the cabinet or the cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee for discussion this week, and a decision will be made after referring to the latest news from Tokyo. In addition, British Ambassador Sir Craigie has submitted a report to the government on his conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, stating that the Japanese Foreign Minister has taken note of Britain's views. However, since the current situation in Tianjin has not changed, it is essential that the various members of the Japanese government are still discussing the matter. It is possible that the country may, within a few days, make any demands based on the statement made by the Japanese spokesperson in Tianjin. In short, (1) the British should agree not to interfere with Japan's intrusion into China in administrative and economic terms; (2) the British should stop aiding Chinese currency. If the Tianjin dispute is limited to the issue of the extradition of the four Chinese, then a friendly solution is originally possible. If Japan makes greater demands in the future, it must be resisted at any cost, because after this step in Tianjin, the issue of revising the entire concession system within China will arise, and the rights and power that Britain possesses in China will inevitably be lost.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union passed a motion today, stating that Japan's actions in China pose a serious crisis to the British Empire and general peace. The British government must take the most effective means to stop it. The main points of the full text are five: (1) Condemn the brutal situation of Japanese aircraft bombing Chongqing and other places; (2) Repudiate Japan's deliberate opposition to foreign concessions in China; (3) Protest against the Japanese killing of British military personnel and civilians, interfering with British commerce, and intercepting British merchant ships; (4) Demand that the government immediately take the most effective means to prevent continuous atrocities that violate international law and justice; (5) Advocate that the Empire consult with others on countermeasures and submit this issue to the League of Nations for discussion.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Unanimously Demand Strong Action</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 16th) The "Daily Telegraph" commented on the Tianjin incident today, saying, "The intention of the Japanese military's move is to obtain a favorable position through empty threats, but it has obviously failed. What concessions the Japanese side is willing to make or to what extent it will increase pressure on the British authorities in the Far East remains to be seen in the future development of the situation. The cooperation of Britain, France, and the United States is extremely necessary. In view of the fact that Japan's new actions and the pressure exerted by the European Axis powers are happening at the same time, the cooperation of these three countries is even easier to realize. Japanese government leaders have been extremely cautious in promising military assistance to the Axis powers. Now, if Western democracies take some obvious steps to boycott Japanese trade, Japan may inquire about what kind of economic assistance Germany and Italy can provide. If the provocative behavior in Tianjin continues to exist, the British government will not be satisfied with just lodging protests."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] The British government has not criticized the Tianjin incident, but the British morning newspapers on Thursday continued to demand that the government deal with Japan with the strictest countermeasures. For example, the "Daily Telegraph" stated, "If Japan continues to take challenging actions, the British government cannot just settle for protests." The newspaper also hinted that "Japan dared to act in this way, perhaps after consulting the opinions of the German and Italian Axis powers." The "Daily Express" urged the British public to boycott Japanese goods, while the "Daily Mail" and "News Chronicle" strongly urged the British government to take strong action.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The diplomatic correspondent of "Financial News" recently commented on the situation in Tianjin, China, stating that what the government is currently considering is mainly the following two points: (1) Whether to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911, which grants Japan most-favored-nation treatment; (2) Whether to prohibit the import of Japanese raw materials into Britain. Regarding the former, abolition should originally be notified one year in advance, but the British government may believe that Japan's actions in Tianjin violate the commercial treaty and that the one-year notice period need not apply. Generally speaking, this method is more likely to be adopted than measures to discriminate against Japanese shipping. The government is maintaining close contact with the various dominions, and all actions will be taken after consultation with them. The "Daily Express" reported that Japanese soldiers in Tianjin searched currency in the name of searching for anti-Japanese elements, pointing at British women, ordering them to undress for inspection. This is in order to let British people take off the Japanese silk stockings and hats they were wearing, to retaliate. It is hoped that the British people will win in this undressing competition.</p>
<p>French and American Newspapers Unanimously Support Britain's Attitude</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] The evening newspapers here are enthusiastically supporting Britain's attitude in dealing with the Tianjin issue and strongly stating that the Japanese are now raising a broad and general issue for concessions everywhere. "Debate Daily" said, "Regardless of the Japanese motive, the common interests of Britain and France are the most certain fact. The British and French governments have already consulted together, and any resolution, British and French will act in unison,"</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] "Radical Daily" criticized the Japanese blockade of Tianjin, saying that economic sanctions can now be implemented. British and French commercial ports can prohibit the use of Japanese merchant ships. Britain's most-favored-nation treatment to Japan, but India and Australia's severance with Japan, is more difficult, and it is urgent to consult with the authorities in those two places, and the cooperation of the United States is particularly important.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Newspapers in Paris and New York all expressed serious concern about the Tianjin situation. The Paris "Justice" newspaper commented that the Japanese military move will lead to the formation of a tripartite alliance. The "Order" newspaper said that the Japanese military action in Tianjin must have been jointly decided by Germany, Italy, and Japan. There is no room for doubt about this. Therefore, whether in material or moral terms, an alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is absolutely necessary. The "New York Times" and "Tribune Herald" both believe that the United States cannot ignore the consequences of the Tianjin incident. The "New York Times" stated, "In the current incident, the position of the United States is different from that of Britain and France and cannot be compared. The policies of the two sides cannot cooperate, but the U.S. government and people cannot ignore incidents occurring on both continents at the same time."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 16th] The morning newspapers published here on Friday all published news of the Tianjin incident in a prominent position, and pointed out that the possibility of Britain taking retaliatory action is increasing day by day. Political circles in France have expressed that whatever action Britain takes, France will provide assistance. However, what kind of pressure Britain will implement in the Far East is not clearly stated in any newspaper. According to the "Little Daily," "Britain is currently considering the following two actions: (1) Restricting Japanese goods in certain markets through economic means; (2) Abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty and canceling the most-favored-nation treatment enjoyed by Japanese goods in the British imperial market." The newspaper also mentioned Chamberlain's speech on Thursday, believing that "given Japan's current weakened strength, Britain will implement retaliation, and the results will be very effective." The "Morning Post" stated, "Currently, the Japanese authorities are trying to avoid any conflict with French interests in Tianjin, so they have issued many passes for the use of French concession officials in Tianjin."</p>
<h3>British Intelligence Department Temporarily Not Established; External Affairs Adds Foreign Propaganda Division Headed by Sir Paneth</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the government has decided not to establish an intelligence department during peacetime, but will add a Foreign Propaganda Division to the Foreign Office, headed by former Ambassador to Italy Sir Paneth. He also stated that the promotion of national messages relies heavily on cultural and educational institutions. The British Privy Council reports accurate information, corrects foreign misunderstandings of British policies, and uses radio stations for foreign-language broadcasts, as well as newspaper promotion. All of these have maintained close contact with powerful diplomatic departments and propaganda agencies. The government believes that the achievements of these agencies in their efforts to promote are even more significant than generally recognized. However, the government believes that if these agencies are concentrated and adjusted by a separate division set up by the Foreign Office, the effect will be enhanced. Therefore, the government has decided to add a Foreign Propaganda Division to the Foreign Office. The division will oversee all agencies previously responsible for propaganda and will add staff. Undersecretary Butler will be largely responsible for this, and Sir Paneth, who has always been known for his knowledge of international affairs, has agreed to come forward to head the division. Chamberlain also stated that once the country goes to war with foreign countries, the government will immediately establish an intelligence department, headed by a minister and undersecretary. This intelligence will be used during wartime. As for peacetime, only a rudimentary agency can be set up to formulate the necessary plans to avoid being unable to take swift action once war breaks out. Chamberlain then answered a question from Labour Party MP Wood that the development of the situation in peacetime is not sufficient to promote the establishment of an intelligence department. The department can only be set up during wartime, and propaganda during peacetime will be limited to the country. The division will not interfere with domestic newspapers. MP Gregg then asked whether the newly established Foreign Intelligence Division would invite experienced journalists who are skilled in propaganda to participate. Chamberlain replied that although the division has close ties with the press, he believes that there is no need to invite reporters to join the Foreign Office.</p>
<h3>Eden Delivers Speech in France; Advocates Using International Court; Rebuilding International Order</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 16th] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech on the European political situation and the problems of British organization at the Moliere Theatre on Thursday afternoon. Among those present were French Finance Minister Reynaud, Minister of the Army Campinchi, British Ambassador to France Phipps, and many other famous British and French diplomats. Eden especially emphasized the solidarity of British-French friendship and its importance in determining the fate of Europe. Eden acknowledged that the British-French alliance also has its shortcomings, but it is better than the two countries going their separate ways. He also said, "Although the British people are disgusted by war, they are not afraid of war. If the national policy of a great country is dominated by 'fear,' it will inevitably lead to its own destruction. Britain has never adopted such a policy today. If anyone makes this mistake, they will soon find their mistake, but the world situation will first fall into chaos. If people can recognize that aggression is not a good idea, lasting peace can be achieved immediately. In order to achieve the true progress of the world, we should use the International Court of Arbitration and mediation methods to rebuild the international order, and finally all armaments can be put aside."</p>
<h3>British King Broadcasts Farewell Speech in Canada</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Halifax, 15th] The British King delivered a farewell broadcast to Canada today, saying, "Our hearts are filled with joy. The weeks of touring Canada have been the most glorious days of our lives. Now we bid farewell to you. Your warm welcome to us will be unforgettable. We hope to have gained some friends among you. We are also very happy to have the opportunity to cross your territory again to visit Canada's great and friendly neighbor." The British King continued in French, "My first responsibility is to express my deepest gratitude to you. In a short period of time, you have allowed us to see many things. We should thank you. You have not only given us kind hospitality, but also the program you have arranged for us is perfect." The British King then said in English, "I have returned home with a new understanding of the resources and responsibilities of the British Empire. I firmly believe that Canada's development prospects are infinitely rich. I hope that Canada will further promote its spiritual strength. I have brought back an idea this time, which is comfort and inspiration. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the tropics to the frigid zones, there is a large land area where there is no possibility of fighting with neighboring countries. Its people love peace and work for peace. This is a good model for all civilized people. It is great that such a land exists in the world. Canada can also be a model for the world to follow." The Queen also broadcast a speech, expressing her gratitude for the enthusiastic hospitality she received during the "unforgettable weeks in Canada." She said, "I am very happy to have seen this great country and its various beautiful things. What is especially unforgettable is that the people in your country are willing to meet with us. I really don't know how to express my heartfelt thanks. I also want to tell the women and children of Canada that it is a pleasure to meet with them. Our family of five will never forget this trip to Canada. I would like to thank the people of Canada and the United States. May God bless you and wish you well. Goodbye." According to reports, the British King and Queen arrived here at 3:00 PM. The British King was wearing a naval admiral's uniform and looked slightly tired. Canadian Governor-General Lord Tweedsmuir boarded the British King's special train at Yale and came here together.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] When the British King and Queen return here from Canada, they will tour the streets twice by car so that the public can see their grace and welcome the British King and Queen back home. The first tour will be held when they arrive in port on the 22nd of this month. The British King and Queen will drive from Waterloo Station to Buckingham Palace. The second tour will be to the City Hall to have lunch with the Mayor of London. Queen Mary, the two princesses, and other members of the royal family will meet the British King and Queen in Southampton.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] A Reuters special correspondent on the British King's special train stated that the British King and Queen are about to return home and have only a few hours of stay in Canada. Only those traveling with the British King and Queen can express their impressions of this trip. First, the visit of the British King and Queen to Canada not only promoted the unity between Britain and Canada, but also promoted the internal unity of Canada. The French, German, Chinese, and Canadians all gave the British King and Queen a warm welcome. Second, this trip by the British King has strengthened the entire concept of constitutional monarchy. Third, the British King's confidence in constitutional monarchy has also been strengthened. His firm speeches prove that he is a capable political speaker. American correspondents who accompanied him all have this impression. For example, a dispatch from a special correspondent of the New York Times stated, "Before the British King and Queen visited Canada, most Canadians were willing to fight for their country, but now they are all willing to fight for the British King and Queen. Canada is closer to Britain now than ever before." Regarding the visit of the British King and Queen to the United States, the correspondent said that this trip was not intended to affect U.S. foreign policy, but it has introduced modern Britain to the United States and shown that the British dominions are a powerful force for human progress.</p>
<h3>British Colonial Secretary Explains Palestine Plan; Although It May Not Have Any Effect in the Short Term, It Will Achieve Great Goals in the Future</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 15th] MacDonald explained Britain's policy on Palestine in the League of Nations Mandates Commission this afternoon. He stated that the current moment has become hot, and it is possible to plan to establish a constitutional polity for the common interests of Arabs and Jews. The best way is to establish separate zones of Arab and Jewish rule, each with greater autonomy, and to establish a central government to manage common affairs, while both sides still have their own traditions and beliefs to live freely. Only in this way can peace, lasting friendship, and prosperity be established. The government does not believe that this plan will have any effect in the near future, because the past relations are too deep. However, the government believes that this plan has been carefully considered and can indeed achieve great goals.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 15th] The League of Nations Mandates Commission has just completed its review of the report on the Palestine mandate. It is understood that the cost of recent disturbances has been enormous, and the education budget for 1939 will be reduced. The general impression is that although there have been frequent disturbances, the administrative authorities have coped with them freely. The police believe that the disturbances have subsided, and they are also trying to alleviate the unemployment problem among the Arabs, who also have more severe unemployment than the Jews. British Colonial Secretary MacDonald unexpectedly did not attend this morning's meeting. He will deliver a speech on Britain's attitude towards the mandate at the afternoon meeting, which will also discuss the Palestine White Paper.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 15th] The daytime curfew here will continue for ten days in the Jewish quarter of Hebron, because on Sunday, there was a bombing case there that destroyed a government truck, killing one person and injuring twelve.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 15th] Police Inspector Dodd and British lawyer Shillingman were charged in the local court with helping to organize groups and smuggling Jewish refugees into the country. According to police investigations, the crime has been committed as many as thirty times. Shillingman is the chairman of the Palestine Colonial and Dominion Federation and has been working to partition Palestine into the British Empire.</p>

<p>Small Commentary</p>
<h3>New Puppet Show</h3>
<p>Today, Reuters reported that the Japanese [omission] will use Wang Jingwei as a puppet to replace Wang Kemin, hoping to announce the reorganization of the puppet government on July 7, or to present it in a new joint form.</p>
<p>In the two years of the Japanese [omission] invasion of China, they have encountered setbacks in military, political, and economic aspects, and they have to intensify their political conspiracy, hence the preparation for Wang Jingwei to stage a new puppet show. However, the Shanghai North-China Daily said it well on the 14th: "Even if Wang is heavily relied upon by the Japanese and takes office as the leader of the puppet government, it will be difficult to gain the support of the general public." In fact, it is more than difficult to gain the support of the people. Wang Jingwei's use of terror in Shanghai and other places to deal with anti-Wang and anti-peace movements shows that he is at the end of his rope!</p>
<p>However, Wang Jingwei's perverse actions will inevitably fail in the end, but the words and deeds of Wang and others, as well as those who follow them, to undermine national unity and shake the belief in resistance, are still enough to hinder the cause of resisting Japan and saving the nation! The central government has issued a clear order to strictly apprehend the traitor Wang. [Omission]! Generals such as Li Han-hun and overseas compatriots have successively sent telegrams supporting the central government's order to arrest Wang Ming, and all Chinese people and their communities who do not want to be slaves should pay attention [omission]!</p>
<h3>Relief for the Homeless</h3>
<p>[Our] Hong Kong [community has] always worked extremely hard to save and assist homeless civilians. However, due to the current situation and social and economic relations, the number of homeless men and women under the arcades of various roads and streets has broken all previous records in Hong Kong. What we hear and see are our fellow countrymen. How can we not feel compassion?</p>
<p>Some people are asking the authorities to pay serious attention to the following relief measures for these homeless men and women: (1) [omission], (2) the housing rent problem, (3) the commodity price problem, and (4) the transportation problem. Of course, if these four problems can be properly solved, not only can we expect the homeless men and women to disappear, but the safety and order of the entire society can also be guaranteed, and many unfortunate events can also be expected to be reduced to almost none.</p>
<p>However, of these problems, what we hope can be solved by the power of the authorities is actually only a very small part. Therefore, we must also strive for symptomatic relief outside of what we are talking about.</p>

<h3>Small Problem</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang's family has four puppies, who only know how to eat and fight for food. Now their dining halls are also separated. However, we must draw four clear lines so that they do not interfere with each other and live in peace. Can you draw it? If not, I will tell you tomorrow.</p>
<h3>One Person a Day</h3>
<p>Professor Einstein, the genius who invented the theory of relativity, is most afraid of social interactions, receptions, speeches, and interviews with reporters. In 1930, when he went to the United States, he declared that he refused these tricks. But as soon as he arrived in New York, he couldn't help himself. Luncheons, tea parties, dinners, talks, lectures, broadcasts, theater visits, tours: he was busy for five whole days. On the last night, he thought he could finally have a good rest, but as soon as he sat down in his hotel, a group of reporters came to ask him about his impressions of his visit to the United States. He couldn't help but get angry and shouted, "Get out of here right away!" But when the group of reporters, crestfallen, was about to leave, he rushed up and shouted, "Come back, young people, I will answer your questions." He originally didn't allow reporters to draw portraits or take pictures, but when he saw an artist secretly sketching, he took it over and inscribed a sentence in German: "This overnourished fat pig seems to be Professor Einstein."</p>
<h3>Aphorisms</h3>
<p>It's better to give something to someone than to lend it, because the cost is almost the same - British reporter Gibber.</p>
<p>Nothing can be accomplished by a committee unless there are three members on the committee, one sick and the other absent - Van Loon</p>
<h3>Rain Flower</h3>
<p>A: Friend, your house leaks like this, why don't you fix it?</p>
<p>B: Yes! But, workers don't come to repair it on rainy days; when it's sunny, isn't it fine? Why should I spend money to repair it?</p>
<p>Father: What did the school teach today?</p>
<p>Father: Are you mute? Why don't you answer when I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Son: Today the teacher talked about "think twice before you act."</p>
<p>Customer: Have you fired that pretty salesgirl?</p>
<p>Pharmacy Manager: Yes, customers say that seeing her smile is like taking a tonic!</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>The weather today, haha, if I want to go up, it should be: cloudy and sunny, uncertain, or windy and rainy. Yesterday, the weather forecast was: cloudy and sunny, uncertain, or windy and rainy. Sure enough, it was cloudy in the morning and sunny in the afternoon. Isn't it just a cloudy and sunny situation? There was wind but no rain, which just hit half of the "or windy and rainy" phrase. This is actually obvious. Who said the weather forecast is inaccurate.</p>
<p>To put it impolitely, or I dare not praise Hong Kong people for being good at doing business, Hong Kong people don't even seem to know how to do advertisements very well. However, in the past two days, I have seen several outstanding ones, and I would like to recommend them to readers.</p>
<p>In the classified ads of the ×× Daily: "Sister ×× graduated from a middle school in the old capital and has not continued her studies since the July 7th Incident. She is now working at the ×× Guidance Company. Please call 14534 after seeing the newspaper." In the news of the ×× Evening News: "Comedian star ××× went out yesterday to shoot a scene, acting in a scene of "Coffin Spirit" breaking open a coffin and stealing treasure in a chaotic grave. Unexpectedly, the corpse in the coffin suddenly trembled, its eyes shining brightly, and ××× lost his composure on the spot... He said that he would never dare to try this kind of work again in the future."</p>
<p>Finally, let's put forward the advertisement for "Resisting Japan and Saving China" at the Central Theater: "We should certainly watch this film to understand the true certainty of winning the war of resistance; the Japanese should also watch this film to let them know that the collapse is imminent; traitors should watch this film even more so that they can realize that surrendering to Japan is a dead end." After reading this advertisement, I can only shout long live.</p>
<h3>Small Anecdotes</h3>
<p>When you throw an airmail letter into the mailbox, have you ever thought about how airmail delivery started? Let me tell you some small anecdotes here.</p>
<p>That was exactly twenty years ago. On May 15, 1918, one day not long after the end of the European War, at 11:30 in the morning, Captain Webb flew his exquisite Curtis aircraft from Belmont Airport in New York, opening the maiden voyage of mail delivery between New York, Philadelphia, and Washington.</p>
<p>Similarly, on the Washington side, amid the cheers of American President Wilson and his cabinet, a light aircraft driven by Lieutenant Bowyer also flew north.</p>
<p>At about 1 p.m., Lieutenant Webb's plane, which departed from New York, landed outside Philadelphia with 344 pounds of mail. Another plane and another pilot, Lieutenant Eckton, immediately continued the second leg of the journey - from Philadelphia to Washington - arriving at its destination at 2:50 p.m., completing the first airmail delivery. Unfortunately, Bowyer and his mail plane suddenly lost their way 25 miles from Washington, resulting in a forced landing in the middle, creating a flight mail accident. Lieutenant Paul, who was waiting in Philadelphia, flew straight to New York at 2:30 p.m. after waiting for a long time. He arrived at his destination at 2:37 p.m.</p>
<p>In this maiden airmail flight, there are the following statistics: a journey of 218 miles, a time of 194 minutes, a speed of less than 75 miles per hour, a postage of 24 cents per ounce, and the most letters came from American President Wilson, with 18 letters.</p>

<h3>Sea Storms VI</h3>
<p>- Written by Captain劳働 Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>The previous article stated that in 1914, when the European situation was already tense, the American steamer "Kailong Boqi" was carrying six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the邱克斯 company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took the ship to tour Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator Lomon Garo, and the German wireless operator Bofor on the ship. When Jack was working on behalf of Bao, he received a strange message saying that if Britain and Germany declared war, British warships would come to intercept the ship. The captain asked Jack to officially serve as the ship's wireless operator...</p>
<p>"We are not going to Europe anymore. We are going back to the American port and trying to avoid capture. Six million gold dollars is a very hot prize, which is worth chasing them. I don't believe we have a chance to reach a European port."</p>
<p>Jack pondered for a while, "Okay! I guess my vacation is hopeless anyway. Working now is the same as working later. Let's put it this way, captain, I'll be your employee."</p>
<p>"That's great, I won't let you suffer." The captain said.</p>
<p>This evening, at dinner time,胞佛's working hours were over. Jack sat in front of the machine. It was very dark, and there was no more talk from the British cruiser. The "Kailong Boqi" sailed for a long time without changing direction. An urgent coded telegram was sent to the New York shipping company, but there was no reply for so long.</p>
<p>However, Jack had been working for less than an hour when the expected order finally came. The passengers were all on the deck, some walking, some sitting. They were all suddenly surprised to find that the big ship was slowly turning around. At first, they couldn't believe it, but it was immediately confirmed because the moon was shining on this side just now, but now it was shining on the other side.</p>
<p>The whole ship was immediately in an uproar. Maybe there was something wrong with the engine room, maybe there was an iceberg in front, maybe there was some accident in the place where the gold was hidden. Everything that could be thought of was on this big ship. They wanted to find the captain or a crew member to ask for clarification; however, at this time, none could be found.</p>
<p>Near midnight, the captain walked into the smoking room alone, holding a telegram in his hand.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," he said to the people gathered in this room, "I am very sorry, I can only report to you that Britain and Germany have declared war. Britain, France, and Russia will intercept our route."</p>
<p>The room was in turmoil immediately. The captain raised his hand high and tried his best to suppress the noise. When it calmed down a little, he continued to say.</p>
<p>"It is impossible for this ship to continue to move forward. You have already noticed that the direction has been changed. We are sailing back to America."</p>
<p>"To New York?" Many voices asked.</p>
<p>The captain shook his head, "New York must be more heavily guarded than all the ports on the Atlantic. I haven't decided where to go, but I ask you to be reasonable in this situation and try to comfort those frightened women."</p>
<p>Then, a series of confused questions and answers, and excited conversations broke out again. In the meantime, the captain's huge body disappeared from the door.</p>
<p>Soon after, Bi Yunano, because he couldn't find Jack anywhere on the ship, ran into the radio room.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" he asked. "Are you working for this ship?"</p>
<p>"It looks like that's the case, doesn't it?" Jack smiled.</p>

<h3>This Week's Stock Market: Suddenly Turns from Prosperity to Sorrow Due to the Tianjin Situation</h3>
<p>Although there have been repeated situations that have affected the market here in the past month, in the previous week, the Hong Kong stock market was still booming, and prices continued to rise. When this week began, the market was still stable, and it was really possible to continue to rise. However, it was suddenly affected by the dangerous situation in Tianjin, causing this prosperous trend to be like a head-on blow, creating a bleak situation for several days. However, although general prices have fallen, depositors are not in a state of unwarranted worry. As for the stocks of various public utilities companies, they remain unchanged. The closing prices of yesterday's trading are listed below.</p>

<h3>New Measures for the Exchange of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>- Xi Jialin</p>
<p>Since the Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee telegraphed Shanghai on the morning of the 7th to temporarily suspend the sale of foreign exchange, a huge wave has been set off in the Shanghai exchange market. In two days, it has fallen from eight pence twenty-five to six pence half. The prices of hardware and foreign goods on the market have risen, and gold coins have also been speculated, rising wildly. Although the public still maintains confidence in legal tender, those with poorer general knowledge are inevitably frightened by rumors. Although the Ministry of Finance has not officially announced the detailed measures of this decision, based on various sources and our speculation, the government seems to have decided to fix the new exchange rate at around six and a half pence to adapt it to the balance of international payments, and to impose appropriate restrictions on the supply of foreign exchange in the open market thereafter. Now, let's clarify the points that are likely to be misunderstood by the public with this new measure and describe its significance below.</p>
<p>(1) The government's change of the exchange rate equalization does not mean abandoning the policy of maintaining the exchange rate of legal tender. First of all, we must point out to everyone that the government's support for the market exchange rate of legal tender did not start with the establishment of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund in March of this year. Therefore, this temporary suspension of the supply of foreign exchange by the Equalization Fund Committee does not mean that the government will ignore the market exchange rate from now on. We know that when the government implemented the foreign exchange approval law in March last year, it used limited approval quotas to ease the fall of the exchange rate. After mid-June, the government even joined forces with the Exchange Bank to maintain the exchange rate above the standard of eight pence to eliminate the forces of speculation. This exchange rate has been maintained for more than ten months. In March of this year, in order to strengthen the structure of the stable use of the exchange rate, it joined the United Kingdom to establish a foreign exchange equalization fund to stabilize the exchange rate on a stronger foundation. However, we must understand that the policy of establishing this exchange rate equalization fund to stabilize the exchange rate is just like our country's basic military strategy in the War of Resistance. It should not be defended at any cost in any place. The government's discretionary measures based on market conditions are not only legitimate but also necessary. Today, the government is adjusting trade by lowering the black market exchange rate due to the sudden increase in non-essential imports, and may raise the exchange rate again in the future due to changes in the international economic situation. This is equally possible and equally legitimate.</p>
<p>(2) The government's move is proactive and active.</p>
<p>A country's intervention in the exchange market can be divided into active and passive. The Chinese government is now stabilizing the black market exchange rate at a new standard, taking a preemptive and active approach. This means that this new measure is by no means due to the exhaustion of foreign exchange funds and forced suspension, but to prepare for contingencies and strengthen preparation. We have several very powerful bases,</p>
<p>1. Since the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund in mid-March to the beginning of this month, it has only been two and a half months in total. Even according to the most extreme estimate, the 10 million pound equalization fund can at least maintain the eight pence exchange rate for more than a year and a half. There is absolutely no reason why it would be used up in two and a half months. Moreover, the foreign exchange obtained by the government through export restrictions now has a considerable amount, which can be used to supplement the exchange fund at any time, making the exchange fund more consolidated.</p>
<p>2. Although the bogus banknotes in the North and South are trying their best to obtain foreign exchange, according to reliable estimates by foreigners, the legal tender obtained by the "United Bank Notes" in the year since their issuance is less than one-tenth of the amount of legal tender circulating in North China (that is, about 30 million yuan), and since the issuance of "Huaxing Notes", due to obstacles in circulation, there are only more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, in these two and a half months, the pressure of counterfeit currency on legal tender foreign exchange is also not very great.</p>
<p>3. The Chinese government's overseas deposits and cash silver reserves are very sufficient, and they are constantly supplemented by loans and remittances from overseas Chinese. Since the start of the war, they have only increased and not decreased. If necessary, it is easy to use a portion to maintain the eight-and-a-half-pence exchange rate.</p>
<p>4. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the British and American governments have made every effort to assist China. The stability of legal tender is of great benefit to the British and American investors who have significant vested interests in China. If legal tender cannot remain stable, how can they not support it? It is obvious that this move is the result of close consultation between China and relevant parties, and it is a completely planned and active policy.</p>

<h3>Correcting a Mistaken Notion</h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>I ran into a friend who asked me where I had been making a name for myself lately. At first, he said he was unemployed at home, but then he said he was teaching a few hours in a small school. Then he said to me with a wry smile:</p>
<p>"Old buddy, this is just a temporary shelter from the storm. When the opportunity comes, ha, old buddy!..."</p>
<p>Taking the sacred profession of elementary school teacher as a "temporary shelter from the storm"—this kind of concept, I think, probably exists consciously or unconsciously among quite a few elementary school teachers across China.</p>
<p>This is a serious crisis in the elementary education world. With this extraordinarily mistaken concept lurking, it will undoubtedly affect the growth of the new buds of our Chinese nation.</p>
<p>We should correct this mistaken notion.</p>
<p>Admittedly, at present, elementary school teachers are not valued, and are even looked down upon. Unflattering names like "cold bench" and "monkey king" are placed on elementary school teachers, proving the low "social status" of elementary school teachers in general. Of course, we do not deny that in Shanghai, elementary schools have indeed become places for heroes who have failed in politics and business to seek shelter from the storm. However, looking down on elementary school teachers is like looking down on oneself. To exaggerate, it is a crime against one's own country. Saying that "children are the future masters of the country," and yet looking down on the career of shaping "children" into "the masters of the future country," imagine: isn't this a crime against the country?</p>
<p>Another admission, elementary school teachers are indeed "poor" as people generally say. A rickshaw puller may have a higher income than an elementary school teacher. But here we must understand that being an "elementary school teacher" is not the same as being a "manager" in a business firm, specializing in "business acumen." The elementary school teacher is engaged in a sacred career, is the educator who creates the future masters of the country. We should not think from the perspective of "business acumen," but from the perspective of the future of the "nation and the people." Of course, I am not saying here that we should not fight for the treatment of elementary school teachers themselves, or that we can put it aside. On the contrary, we must strive for reasonable living conditions for our elementary school teachers, which does not conflict with our sacred ideals.</p>
<p>At present, the responsibilities on the shoulders of elementary school teachers everywhere are as great as those of the armed comrades on the front lines. In the so-called "occupied areas," the invaders have already begun to transform the minds of our innocent friends in order to adapt them to their aggressive will, that is, to transform them all into docile slaves. We can see "children's corners" in their newspapers, and from the news, we can know that there are so-called "children's goodwill friendship associations." In order to prevent guerrillas from destroying railway traffic, there are organizations such as the "Railway Protection Youth Corps" (this, in my short collection of fairy tales "The Little Tin Soldier," which will be published soon, I have written into a fairy tale, exposing the cruel and malicious conspiracy of the invaders). Such trivial organizations and their so-called educational measures are simply too numerous to mention! Can our elementary school teachers embrace the idea of "sheltering from the storm" and "play around" with these "small tricks"?</p>
<p>Of course not!</p>
<p>We are not afraid of being looked down upon by others. Only when we "abandon ourselves" will we be despised! We should correct our mistaken idea of "sheltering from the storm." We must shoulder our sacred responsibility! I believe that one day, those who look down on us will apologize to us, and we will not be unworthy of being loyal sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Greeting the Battle:</h3>
<p>— Yu Saifu</p>
<p>The nightingale flew over the bushes, how quiet it is by the railway, not a single person, the moon whispers quietly to the little white flowers, but the spring wind makes the white flowers shrink into the tangled weeds.</p>
<p>Not a single person...</p>
<p>Following the drifting clouds, is the coldness of the night. Finally, a human figure lightly, lightly floated from the swamp by the river to the side of the railway.</p>
<p>Like a duck flapping its wet wings -- just this slight sound, so many human figures, they are silent, they slip through the bright moonlight, they cross the railway, and then rush to the dark place, just crossing the railway section with no shade, the moonlight smiles on their bayonet tips, smiling brightly.</p>
<p>--Come, there, to there!</p>
<p>So, three people carried a machine gun. They jumped and found a very reliable place -- a raised tomb.</p>
<p>--Look, yes, there is a spark --</p>
<p>--Spark? …</p>
<p>--Japanese!</p>
<p>So, seven people lay prone on the ground, crawling slowly towards the starlight, the rest were arranged in an arc. The machine gunner constantly tilted his head, using a sharp gaze to observe all the movements, even the swaying of the orange branches was noticed.</p>
<p>The warriors wiped the sweat from their faces...</p>
<p>In the distance, there are sparks, red and green; the floating clouds turned pale yellow, and the sky was still dark blue. The floating clouds drifted further away, the wind picked up, … a warrior picked up a small white flower at random, the moonlight condensed on his wrinkled, sallow face.</p>
<p>They are waiting for a powerful sound.</p>

<p>Expressed completely in a few rough words.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the Shu Road has been known to be difficult,</p>
<p>But now the Sichuan Road is even more distressing;</p>
<p>Getting a ride is harder than seeking a good position,</p>
<p>The journey is slower than crossing the ocean;</p>
<p>Toads are afraid of great power,</p>
<p>Water ducks act ferociously;</p>
<p>Alas, travelers can only endure,</p>
<p>I advise you not to travel lightly in the future.</p>
<p>Note: The Sichuan Road Station Master Jiang resembles a toad, and the station clerk Lu resembles a water duck.</p>
<p>"It's deplorable that I came a thousand miles in exile,</p>
<p>The state-run transportation is full of suspicion;</p>
<p>Hanzhong and Ningqiang each govern,</p>
<p>Through tickets are treated like dirt.</p>
<p>The country is in such a state of survival,</p>
<p>But the work is still done lethargically;</p>
<p>The revolutionary spirit has not yet been reformed,</p>

<h3>Collective Blows</h3>
<p>— Ji Zi</p>
<p>The invaders' style has always been to avoid the strong and prey on the weak, and this can be proved by past historical facts. In the past, such as the Zhanggufeng Incident, the fishery disputes, and the current withdrawal of troops from Gulangyu, each time it shows that baring one's teeth and brandishing one's claws is not to be feared. As long as people facing the invaders really show some color and some strength, the demons will naturally run away with their tails between their legs.</p>
<p>There must be no appeasement or concession to the invaders. Repeated appeasement and concession will inevitably lead to raising a tiger to cause trouble. In Europe, due to the policy of "appeasement," Abyssinia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Albania were successively sacrificed and fell into ruin. Isn't the situation in the Far East the same? Unlimited weakness and unlimited retreat finally led to the loss of various economic interests. In the past, because our strength was insufficient during the preparation period, around the September 18th Incident, we tried our best to avoid conflicts with the greedy and insatiable Japanese warlords. As a result, vast stretches of our motherland were lost piece by piece, and we fell into painful darkness, living a life of slavery. The reason for this was still due to the step-by-step retreat at that time. But when our people across the country made up their minds and the Japanese militarists were still dreaming of conquering China," our iron fists had already struck out forcefully. The invaders were awakened from their broken dreams. If they had known earlier in the July 7th Incident that China would no longer retreat and would no longer be willing to appease, I don't think they would have dared to mobilize so rashly.</p>
<p>The most important thing in striking the invaders is to avoid individual actions and to adopt the two tactics of empty protests, because the invaders are the most cunning guys in the world. They will echo each other and help to contain the opposing forces. For example, if something happens in Europe, the invaders in the Far East will take the opportunity to seize Xiamen and Hainan, shaking the foundations of British and American interests in China, and threatening the South Seas with their navy. These are all very clear historical lessons, proving that unless collective action is adopted, individual blows are extremely difficult. As for using stronger force to strike, such as the actions taken by the Soviet Union in the Zhanggufeng Incident and the fishery disputes, it is of course even better!</p>
<h3>Wearing Shoes (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mingzhi</p>
<p>—Grandma's Story—</p>
<p>"They are currently placed at my nephew A Sen's house."</p>
<p>Following that, the grandmother and Li Jingen agreed that he would go to Qian Asen's house in the afternoon when he was free to retrieve the shoes. The money for the beans would also be brought at that time, there was no need to give it now. The grandmother naturally told him the location of Qian Asen's residence in detail.</p>
<p>Seeing that the first step of her objective had been achieved, even though the beans in her basket had not been completely sold out, the grandmother slowly descended from the teahouse and returned to Qian Asen's residence.</p>
<p>"Will he come?" Qian Asen asked as soon as he saw her.</p>
<p>"He will come," the grandmother said again, "But don't say anything to him. Just listen to me."</p>
<p>Qian Asen was known for being a quick talker, so she had to instruct him in this manner.</p>
<p>Around three or four o'clock in the afternoon, Li Jingen indeed arrived with a limp. Qian Asen not only refrained from saying anything to him, but after greeting him, said that he was going outside to stand guard at the door, to see if anyone was coming in, or eavesdropping. Of course, this was also what the grandmother had taught him to do.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much," Li Jingen said as he entered, "For bringing the shoes for me."</p>
<p>"Sit down and chat. I will retrieve the shoes for you when you're about to return."</p>
<p>"How is my family?" Li Jingen said after sitting down.</p>
<p>"Wait, wait," the grandmother hastily stopped him, "I still have something to say to you: Do you think 'they' are really good to people? Didn't you say before that things weren't necessarily good for you in 'their' place?"</p>
<p>"Before," Li Jingen then sat down again, "I truly didn't think 'they' were good; since I was injured and 'they' treated me, I have felt that 'they' are good."</p>
<p>"You are truly muddle-headed -- I will only ask you this: How did you get this injury in the first place?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>After this question and answer, the grandmother explained that if "they" hadn't come, he wouldn't have been injured, and of course, he wouldn't have needed "their" treatment; with "their" arrival, some of us die, some are injured, and those who are neither dead nor injured suffer greatly; if "they" hadn't come, or if they had come and then left, never to return, we would have good days.</p>
<p>"What you said is very good," Li Jingen said after listening to the grandmother for a while, and then nodded, "Why didn't I think of this earlier? How do you know this so clearly?"</p>
<p>It's no wonder Li Jingen would ask, because the grandmother was, after all, an old woman from the countryside. How would she know these things? After the grandmother told him everything, he suddenly realized and said, "Oh, so I fell for your trick last time, and told you everything."</p>
<p>"You're wrong," the grandmother said with a smile, "You didn't fall for any trick; you did what you should have done. It is 'they' who are being tricked, not you."</p>
<p>"Then what else do you want to know now?"</p>
<p>"Right now, there is nothing I absolutely need to know, but in the future, I will very much want to know some things that I should know."</p>
<p>She then pointed out a series of things that she should know, that is, things that he, Li Jingen, should report.</p>
<p>"As soon as you have news, tell A Sen, and let A Sen tell us, because you can't go far,"</p>
<p>"Isn't that dangerous?" He hesitated somewhat.</p>
<p>"There is danger," the grandmother explained to him again, "But if it's done well, there won't be any danger. However, if you are afraid of danger and refuse to do it... Then danger is bound to befall you and your family. Think about it!" Speaking the last sentence, her tone was somewhat stern.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>She told him that we were already paying attention to him, and had already been paying attention to his family; she also told him that if no one was willing to contribute, everyone would be slaughtered and eliminated by "them" in the future…</p>
<p>"Even if you encounter danger in 'their' place, we won't forget you, we will..." The grandmother said even more thoroughly.</p>
<p>"Okay, I will definitely listen to you!" Li Jingen patted his chest, making a final affirmation.</p>
<p>"Then I can return tomorrow," the grandmother said happily, "Do you have any letter you want me to take back to your family?"</p>
<p>"There is no letter," Li Jingen stood up and said, "Just say that I am doing very well here." Then he stretched out his hand and said, "The shoes? Give them to me."</p>
<p>"They weren't brought here." The grandmother suppressed a laugh.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Your wife hasn't finished making them yet, understand?" The grandmother laughed out loud.</p>
<p>"I understand, I understand," Li Jingen also laughed. "Then I've fallen for your trick again."</p>
<p>As Li Jingen walked out the door, the grandmother grabbed him, feigning surprise and saying:</p>
<p>"What? Are you just leaving like that? You ate my beans? Where's the money!"</p>
<p>"I didn't bring the money. Don't you know?" After a moment of being stunned, Li Jingen also laughed.</p>
<p>Qian Asen, hearing this, also smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>Li Jingen, with a limp, left them in an atmosphere of laughter.</p>

<h3>Two Poems</h3>
<p>— Meng Yan</p>
<p>I have never cried about suffering in all these years of setbacks,</p>
<p>I am still calm in the face of even more fierce oppression.</p>
<p>I carve the black marks deep in my heart to whip myself forward,</p>
<p>And continue living my life at an oblique angle.</p>
<p>Accidental misfortune has given me two scars,</p>
<p>These beautiful and ugly flowers fill me with pride.</p>
<p>Stroking them brings back memories of fierce battles;</p>
<p>I will continue to dye them with the colors of freedom and climb upward.</p>

<h3>Protecting Far East Colonies:  General Naysmith Goes to Singapore to Attend Anglo-French Military Conference, Hong Kong British Warships and Anti-Aircraft Artillery Units to Hold Exercises</h3>
<p>In order to protect Far East colonies and implement joint military cooperation, the governments of Britain and France will hold a military conference in Singapore at the end of this month to discuss all matters.  In addition to the commanders-in-chief of the British and French land, sea and air forces in the Far East, senior staff officers will also attend this conference.  As the conference is approaching, British Army Commander-in-Chief in China Lieutenant General Naysmith and Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Noble left Hong Kong together yesterday aboard the cruiser HMS Kent to Singapore.  French Army Commander-in-Chief in the Far East Lieutenant General Martin and Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Daquet will also travel from Vietnam to Singapore at the end of the month to attend the conference.  It is reported that this conference will focus on how Britain and France can jointly defend and consolidate their Far East colonies.  The Hong Kong Garrison Headquarters, acting as the Singapore Military Affairs East Conference, issued an announcement stating that Singapore is the largest British military base in the Far East. Active development has taken place in recent years, and military ports and airports have been completed in succession. The highest British and French authorities stationed in the Far East will jointly inspect local defense, demonstrating the cooperation between Britain and France in the Far East.</p>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Artillery Fleet to Conduct Live-Fire Exercises</p>
<p>The Navy Department announced yesterday that the British warships HMS Scarab and HMS Robin stationed in Hong Kong will conduct live-fire exercises in the eastern waters of the Lin Ma Channel on the 22nd of this month, using six-inch cannon shells for shooting. At that time, HMS Scarab will first set up a target from the Xiawei headland of Tung Lung Island in the Lin Ma Channel for shooting. HMS Robin will record the results outside the boundary. Then HMS Robin will conduct three-inch cannon shell shooting, and HMS Scarab will record the results. The Army Department also announced that the anti-aircraft artillery unit will hold live-fire exercises at the Hok Tsui Battery in Hong Kong on the 22nd and 29th of this month, from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. The exercise area will be in the B zone. During the exercise, all passing ships must not approach.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Emergency Refugee Relief Association Improves Organization, Establishes Two Committees to Handle Matters Separately</h3>
<p>Work Efficiency Will Definitely Improve in the Future</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the new developments in the Chinese war situation and the needs of the refugee situation in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Emergency Refugee Relief Association held a meeting last week and decided to organize two parallel committees to handle relief matters in Hong Kong and various parts of China separately. The first is the Hong Kong Refugee Relief and Social Welfare Committee, which is responsible for relief work for refugees and the poor in Hong Kong. The second is the China Red Cross International Assistance Committee, which is responsible for charitable relief work in various parts of China. Regarding the first committee, a joint meeting of all groups of the association has been convened to discuss the organization of the committee and elect executive committee members. The second committee will convene a meeting of people from all countries and all walks of life engaged in charitable work in Hong Kong to elect an advisory committee and an executive committee. This improvement in the organization of the association is believed to not only not be inferior to the past in terms of charitable relief work, but is also expected to improve. At a minimum, there will be the following two positive effects: (1) The poor in Hong Kong will be treated equally. Regardless of whether they are refugees from other places or residents of Hong Kong, they will receive relief, and relief can be popularized. (2) The International Assistance Committee has now received the support of the Governor of Hong Kong, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, and the British Ambassador, etc. Its work will be the same as that of the International Red Cross previously established in Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places, and will assist the Chinese Red Cross in engaging in medical relief work in various parts of China. At the same time, it will contact other Red Cross teams.</p>
<h3>YMCA Lecture by Li Zhengyao Tomorrow Evening</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong YMCA will hold a national crisis service at 8:00 p.m. this week (the 18th). Mr. Li Zhengyao, a student at the University of Hong Kong, has been specially invited to give a lecture. People from all walks of life are welcome to participate. Mr. Li once represented Hong Kong students at the Second World Youth Assembly in the United States. This lecture will surely contribute new impressions gained from his travels in the United States to us.</p>
<h3>London Charity Bazaar Item Solicitation Committee Holds Tea Party Yesterday to Entertain All Sectors, Decides to Assign Six Women's Groups to Be Responsible for Solicitation</h3>
<p>The London Charity Bazaar Item Solicitation Committee, jointly convened by Soong Ching-ling, Soong Ai-ling, Zhang Yueyi, He Xiangning, He Baofang, and others, held a tea party at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, inviting leaders of women's groups from all walks of life to discuss preparations. Soong Ching-ling, He Xiangning, Shen Huilian, Wu Yanzhuang, Cai Fengzhen, Hu Mulan, Ma Fengju, Xu Jun, Liao Mengxing, Li Furong, Quan Yucheng, Shan Dexin, Tai Maozhao, Gao Shuzhi, Yang Yiqing, Ye Shaoshang, Liang Shude, Xu Dezhi, etc., attended. He Xiangning chaired the meeting, and Wu Yanzhuang recorded the minutes. The chairman first gave an opening speech, announcing the reasons for holding the meeting, stating that the Women's Comfort Society had previously received a letter from Madame Chiang Kai-shek, requesting them to initiate the solicitation of items for the London Charity Bazaar in order to raise funds for sending to England for sale. Therefore, Mrs. Sun, Mrs. Kung, Mrs. Soong, Mrs. Wu, and herself jointly sent letters to the leaders of women's circles, inviting them to come and provide guidance. The chairman also requested people from all walks of life to donate enthusiastically with the most sincere feelings, so that the soldiers on the front lines and the elderly and children in distress could deeply benefit from it. The chairman said that the country is in a state of being oppressed in deep water and fire. We can only contribute our efforts, speak out, and use our pens. The chairman's passionate remarks were all moving. Then, Mrs. Ma Shen Huilian reported, reporting in detail on the general situation on the front lines, and giving a detailed account of the work of the Women's Comfort Society Headquarters. Now, the whole country is united, fighting bravely under the supreme leadership. The more bombings, the stronger the people's hearts; the more battles, the stronger the morale. Madame Chiang Kai-shek previously stated that the children in the war zone were in an extremely miserable situation. In addition to immediately establishing a children's welfare association, she also stepped up children's rescue work. Madame Chiang Kai-shek initiated the solicitation of items for the London Charity Bazaar, and it is hoped that the leaders of women's circles here will work hard to solicit donations, and that overseas Chinese from all walks of life will donate enthusiastically to jointly accomplish this righteous cause. After Mrs. Ma finished her report, it was decided that six groups, including the Women's Comfort Society, the New Life Movement, the China Defense League, the Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association, the YWCA, and the War Disaster Relief Association, would jointly organize a solicitation committee and designate the Women's Comfort Society as the convener to step up the work. Mrs. Wu Chao-hsu He Baofang then donated 250 yuan on the spot and handed it over to Mrs. Kong to be taken to Chongqing. Mrs. Wu's willingness to do her part is truly admirable. Then, Yuan Jintao, a representative of the press, delivered a thank-you speech, expressing his gratitude and saying that he was willing to contribute his efforts and use his pen under the guidance of the leaders of the women's circles. Finally, Mrs. Sun gave an additional report, saying that she had just received a letter from Mrs. Li Wu Jufang, stating that mosquito nets were urgently needed on the front lines, and she hoped that people from all walks of life would donate. The following is a list of the items to be solicited this time. It is sincerely hoped that enthusiastic people in Hong Kong will donate generously with their patriotic enthusiasm, so that the path of relief can be relied upon. Items for foreigners to appreciate are as follows: colorful handkerchiefs (with lace, words, and embroidery, etc.), embroidered silk clothes, satin morning gowns, floral short shirts and pants, men's and women's slippers, embroidered leather suitcases, Chinese-style Christmas cards and calendars, Fujian porcelain, embroidered tea mats, bowl mats, and long table runners, ivory small objects, Shandong glassware and dining and hand-washing bowls, Chinese-made postcards, black tea leaves, embroidered handkerchiefs and jewelry boxes, decorative pins, brooches, earrings, buttons, Chinese spoons, rice bowls, small plates, chopsticks, silk cushions, covers, and tablecloths, etc., Shandong silk bed sheets and tablecloths, metal cigarette sets and ashtrays, Fujian lacquer tea trays, etc. (Note) It is hoped that the above items will be generously donated and sent to London before October 15th.</p>
<h3>This Month's Criminal Cases: 16 Cases, 7 Involving Possession of Weapons and Robbery</h3>

<h3>Sharp Increase in Hong Kong's Population; Livestock Suffer; Daily Slaughter of Pigs and Sheep Increases by 40%</h3>
<p>Following the sharp increase in Hong Kong's population, the demand for food has also increased. The supply of pigs and cattle has also increased by approximately 40% compared to the average. According to investigations, the Kennedy Town slaughterhouse recently slaughters 200 cattle per day, an increase of 70 from the 130 slaughtered during the same period last year, representing an increase of approximately 50%. Approximately 1,000 pigs are slaughtered daily, an increase of approximately one-third from the 750 slaughtered during the same period last year. At the Kowloon Ma Tau Kok slaughterhouse, the daily slaughter of pigs and cattle is approximately half that of the Hong Kong slaughterhouse, and the percentage increase is said to be the same as in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Police Investigate the Cause of Death of Kimble for Days; Findings from Investigating the Scene Have Not Been Announced; Kim's Mother Also Requests a Detailed Investigation into Her Son's Death</p>
<p>Regarding the death of the American "Kimble" on Peking Road, police authorities have been investigating the cause of her death for days and believe that she may have been injured by falling from a height, but they have not been able to confirm this. The police yesterday dispatched special personnel to investigate the scene of the incident (Tsengko Garou Hotel), and the Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Department dispatched a fire engine to assist in the work, using ladders outside the arcade to measure the height of the building in order to determine whether the victim's injuries were consistent with the height of the building, so as to continue investigating the cause. The results of the police investigation have not yet been announced. It has also been learned that after the incident, the China Aviation Machinery Trading Company has sent details to Kim's mother in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. Kim's mother has received a reply telegram requesting the company to do its best to investigate the cause of her son's death in detail and requesting that the body be transported back to the United States for burial. In addition, this case was previously handled by Inspector Cunningham, and the police have now transferred Detective Inspector Kelly to continue handling the case.</p>
<h3>After the Central Warehouse is Completed, Goods Shipped to England Will Be Inspected; Goods Deemed Eligible for British Preferential Tariffs Will Be Stored in the Central Warehouse by the Import and Export Department</h3>
<p>There are dozens of types of goods manufactured in Hong Kong, such as cotton goods (including cloth, fine yarn shirts, coarse yarn cotton shirts, cotton socks, towels, bath towels, etc.), rayon fabrics (including rayon piece goods, shirts, underwear, stockings, etc.), leather shoes, leather belts, leather cases, camphor wood chests, rattan ware, etc. For various goods that are to be sold to various parts of the British Empire and are intended to enjoy preferential tariff treatment, one week before the goods are shipped, it is necessary to fill in a form with the names, quantities, marks, consignor names, consignee names, ship names, and sources of raw materials, and submit it to customs to apply for a certificate of origin. After receiving the application, the Import and Export Department will send personnel to inspect the goods at the factories. If any misrepresentation is found, the certificate may be refused, or even the factory's right to apply for certificates may be revoked. The inspection procedure is quite meticulous. However, unscrupulous individuals often seize on weaknesses and take the opportunity to commit fraud, deceiving the Import and Export Department authorities. It is reported that some goods shipped to various parts of the British Empire with certificates of eligibility for preferential tariffs do not originate in Hong Kong but are goods from other places. This type of fraud affects the consumption of British raw materials on the one hand and deprives genuine Hong Kong products of their eligibility for preferential tariffs on the other hand, indirectly dealing a fatal blow to Chinese merchants and factories, leaving millions of workers with no means of livelihood and shaking Hong Kong's prosperity. The Import and Export Department authorities are already aware of the existence of this fraud. Therefore, there was a proposal to build a customs warehouse several years ago. If the Import and Export Department had a large-scale warehouse facility, unscrupulous individuals would not be able to continue committing fraud. At that time, the Import and Export Department authorities intended to build a warehouse in Kowloon because most of the factories in Hong Kong are located on the peninsula. After completion, a new method of inspecting goods would be stipulated. If an exporter, trading company, or factory believes that goods are eligible for British preferential tariffs, they must store the goods in the Import and Export Department warehouse for inspection before applying for a certificate of origin. This would prevent the occurrence of many types of fraud. However, this plan of the Import and Export Department was never realized. The authorities have now begun to allocate hundreds of thousands of square feet of land next to the North Point Electric Company's main plant to build a central warehouse. The address is located by the sea, and the concrete wharf has already been completed. The warehouse construction project also began this month and is expected to be completed within eight months. It is reported that in the future, a portion of the warehouse will be allocated to the Import and Export Department for use as a place to inspect goods.</p>
<h3>Tsui Ying Middle School Donates Short Clothing</h3>

<h3>American Bazaar Has Opened</h3>
<p>Paris Bazaar Changed to Be Held in England</p>
<p>The American-French Charitable Bazaar for Relief, initiated by Madam Sun Yat-sen, has been recruiting items in Hong Kong to be shipped to the United States and France. The women's organizations in Hong Kong actively supported it, and the results were satisfactory. It is learned that the American charitable bazaar, due to preparatory reasons, was recently initiated by Mrs. Roosevelt and Ambassador Hu Shih, etc., and has already opened but has not yet ended. The Parisian charitable bazaar has been changed to be held in England and is hosted by the British Aid to China Committee. The amount of money raised from the sale of solicited items will be announced as soon as the two meetings are over, in order to thank the generous donations from all walks of life.</p>

<h3>Chatting About Cat Street</h3>
<p>— Yu Wan</p>
<p>Cat Street does not have foreign firms, nor does it have trading houses. What it does have are antique shops and junk shops.</p>
<p>Speaking separately, antiques are classified as one type, including bronzes, jade, porcelain, ivory, carvings... or things like calligraphy books and rockeries. Junk is also classified as one type, including broken copper and iron, dilapidated furniture, glass utensils, old glasses, projectors and telescopes, fountain pens... hundreds of miscellaneous items, over a dozen stalls. Antiques and junk almost fill every space.</p>
<p>Night in the city is always the most mysterious—what is Cat Street like at night? Because of the ancient and fragrant antique displays and arrangements, plus the brass utensils polished to a dazzling shine by hundreds of workers, they shimmer under the lights, making people a little dizzy. Among them are giant antique vases, ivory tusks three feet long, as well as jade Buddhas less than an inch tall, and snuff bottles not even five fen... Everything else, no matter how carefully you pay attention, you can't point them out one by one. Here, for the sake of human needs, even the smallest "nail" has its value for sale! In short, no matter the size of the item, once it falls into Cat Street, it turns into a "mysterious price" in the meticulous calculations!</p>
<p>Regarding antiques, they would rather not sell one for three years, but they always want several times the profit. As the saying goes, "Open the market for three years." Whether you buy or not is not a problem, as long as you are willing to bargain!</p>
<p>The sources of their goods are uncertain! The goods in department stores are ordered from foreign firms, and the goods in grocery stores are acquired from wholesalers; but the origins of the scattered miscellaneous items on Cat Street, which are so complex that it is impossible to distinguish between new and old, good and bad, are somewhat "unfathomable"! Perhaps they buy them—indeed, we often hear the cry of "buying broken copper and iron" in the alleys. The buyers are originally broken-item buyers! Some of their items are sold to Cat Street, but not entirely. The genius of the antique or junk shop owners lies in this: they have the so-called method of "night bargains" and the means of "pawning." In addition, there are also unscrupulous descendants who smoke opium and steal their ancestors' relics to sell here! In short, there are many tricks, but the principle of "low buying" is the same.</p>
<p>Just like this, they have supported themselves for one or two decades, maintaining several families. It is always necessary to know the goods and have a good eye. We often see an antique, a so-called rare treasure, that allows an antique shop or junk stall to earn hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The street is narrow and sloped, without towering foreign buildings or spacious mansions, just one-story Chinese-style shops. Except for Sam Yat, which is relatively large and pays attention to window decoration, the rest are completely disorganized and disorderly. The ground, doorways, tables, or shelves are all piled with things—irons, phonographs, tassels, broken rackets, and especially all kinds of colorful fountain pens.</p>
<p>Dusk is approaching, and the shopkeepers have turned on all the electric lights, but they are not bright enough, so they have to light small kerosene lamps. Groups of people stroll along both sides of the road, some coming down from Conduit Road, others going up from Hollywood Road. Passing by Cat Street, some stop—idle people wearing silk gowns, gentlemen with cigars, and older people staring blankly at what they want to buy, fully expressing their experience in playing with antiques through bargaining. Perhaps they are domestic bureaucrats and politicians who have come from ancient cities! Ah, the "fame" and "fortune" of the motherland have all been brought along! Family style, family tradition, fame and fortune, feudal remnants, combined with the remaining forces of capital—this is why an antique shop is an antique shop, and a junk stall is a junk stall!</p>
<p>Five or six percent of Westerners also often visit Cat Street, like sailors. They are picking out old white twill and yellow twill clothes and trousers. Soldiers' old leather jackets and leather boots are also bought by them. If they are a couple, they mostly lock themselves in an antique shop to chat and talk. In order to "do business," the owners of almost every shop have to employ one or two assistants who can speak English. Although they can't answer fluently, they can always handle things like "One Dollar."</p>
<p>I heard that during the Lunar New Year this year, antique profits were a hundredfold. Yes, there are many refugees in Hong Kong. The higher-class ones have moved the spirit of buying antiques and decorating for the "New Year," which they used to do in the Confucius Temple in Nanjing and Wende Road in Guangzhou, to Cat Street!</p>
<h3>Headmaster of Diocesan Boys' School Explains in Letter to Head Prefects, Expressing Sympathy and Admiration for Chinese People</h3>
<p>Both in Words and Deeds</p>
<p>Seven head prefects of Diocesan Boys' School left the school in opposition to the Japanese Taiwanese student leader, and gained the sympathy of some students, resulting in more than a hundred students leaving the school at the same time. The details of the incident have been reported in previous newspapers, with the seven head prefects sending a letter to the school board, and the school board instructing the headmaster to take responsibility for handling the matter. Regarding the head prefects' allegation in their letter to the school board that the headmaster's words that day contained insults to China, the headmaster also explained to the seven head prefects in a letter. The headmaster said in his letter that what he wanted to say has been seen in his conversation with reporters and does not need to be supplemented. He was very frightened to learn that the prefects thought that what he said was an insult to China. He has publicly stated that his sympathy and admiration for Chinese people are expressed both in words and deeds. He believes that the prefects must know that he cannot have insulting words to their country. It is truly unfortunate that discord has occurred between the prefects and him in the past few days. He is especially writing to explain because he does not want the misunderstanding to deepen this discord. He is not unconcerned that his words have been so misunderstood.</p>

<h3>Imperial Airways Plane Flies Through Rain to Rangoon, Commendable Service</h3>
<p>The Imperial Airways plane, the "Dorade," was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong yesterday, the 15th, according to schedule. However, it was delayed by one day due to being hindered by wind and rain in Rangoon. It only arrived yesterday afternoon. However, on Tuesday of last week, when the Imperial Airways plane was flying to Rangoon, it was also delayed for a long time due to bad weather. However, there were two packages of documents attached to the mail that were extremely important and had to be delivered to Rangoon immediately. Therefore, Mr. Chung [blank], Director of the Hong Kong Post Office, negotiated with Imperial Airways, and the company agreed to have the driver risk flying out in the wind and rain. The plane arrived safely in Rangoon that evening and delivered the documents properly. Mr. Chung was full of praise for the service spirit of Imperial Airways and sent a letter to the representative of the authorities to thank them and express his respect.</p>

<h3>Three Night Soil Carriers Caught Disposing of Waste at Will</h3>
<p>Old-style buildings in Hong Kong mostly do not have water closets, and are cleaned daily by night soil carriers. Most of these laborers do not understand what public health is, so they often arbitrarily dump night soil into open drains and ditches. This issue was raised for discussion at a meeting of the Department of Health a month ago. It was resolved to send personnel to investigate at any time. If the above incident is discovered, they will be arrested and severely punished according to the law in order to maintain the health of the residents. On the evening of the 15th, Health Department Cleansing Inspector "Goulu" went to inspect the New Reclamation Street and Prince Edward Road areas based on reports, and saw [blank] Jin and Chen Yi, three night soil carriers, [blank] intending to dump [blank] night soil on New Reclamation Street and Prince Edward Road.

<h3>Guangzhou University Holds a Charity Carnival, Scheduled for the 24th of This Month, Location Yet to Be Decided</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the disaster area has become vast, and the cries of suffering are heard everywhere. The number of refugees in dire need of food is increasing daily.

<h3>Our Air Force Bombs Huangpu Xin Zhou, One Plane Damaged and Crashed</h3>
<p>Flying Eagles Take Action to Bomb Huangpu</p>
<p>(Panyu Express News) At around 10 a.m. on the 10th, a squadron of more than ten of our flying eagles took off from a certain location and first went to Guangzhou to scout and raid the enemy camp. After completing their mission at around 10 a.m., one of the six planes flew southeast along the Pearl River, heading straight for Huangpu Xin Zhou. After arriving over Huangpu, they formed a formation and circled low, selecting their targets and continuously dropping more than a dozen bombs. Many hit the enemy's warehouses. Two of the bombs hit the enemy's oil depot, immediately catching fire. Because of the might of our planes, the enemy soldiers did not dare to come out to put out the fire. For more than an hour, our planes soared over Huangpu for about fifty minutes before flying south to continue their search.</p>
<p>Victory for Our Side in the Pearl River Air Battle</p>
<p>At 11:30 a.m., six of our planes flew over the Lion Sea. When they reached the waters near Shilou, they discovered two enemy transport ships sailing from Humen towards Guangzhou. Our planes immediately aimed at the enemy ships and dropped several bombs in succession, but none hit the target. At this time, nine enemy destroyers followed from the Guangzhou side. Our planes formed a formation to meet them and engaged in a fierce aerial battle. One enemy seaplane was hit several times in the tail, wobbled, and almost crashed. The remaining planes did not dare to continue fighting and retreated while fighting, escorting the damaged plane back to Guangzhou. Because our planes were outnumbered, they did not pursue and safely returned to base. It has been verified that the damaged seaplane was too severely damaged and crashed into the Huangpu sea when it arrived in Huangpu. Enemy Imitation of Central Bank of China Currency</p>
<h3>Disrupting Finances, Provincial Government Orders Strict Prevention</h3>
<p>(Zhao Guan Express News) Yesterday, the Provincial Government sent telegrams to the administrative inspectors of various districts, ordering them to strictly prevent conspirators from disrupting finances. It stated that the enemy's financial situation is collapsing daily, while our country's finances are becoming more consolidated and are recognized by countries around the world. Although the enemy has tried to undermine our country's finances, they have not succeeded. Recently, they have imitated and printed our Central Bank of China currency, sending their lackeys and their party members to secretly enter our guerrilla areas with these counterfeit currencies to circulate them. Our highest authorities have detected this, and therefore, telegrams have been sent ordering each county to strictly prevent this and to educate the public at any time not to be deceived by enemy counterfeits.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Active in Hainan Island, Once Attacking Anding and Annihilating Over a Hundred Enemies, County Enemy and Puppet Troops Ambushed in Longgang</h3>
<p>Our Troops Attack Anding</p>
<p>(South Road Express News) In the Hainan Island battle, fierce fighting has erupted in all directions in the past ten days. The activity of our troops and guerrillas has left the enemy exhausted. On the 7th of this month, Wu Daonan, the administrative commissioner of the Ninth District, personally led a certain guerrilla unit of more than two hundred men, together with the Longju Ministry Security Regiment, to counterattack Ding'an City. The enemy troops occupying the city had six to seven hundred men and stubbornly resisted with fortifications. Our plainclothes team entered the city through small roads and launched a surprise attack on the enemy, attacking from the inside and outside. The battle was quite fierce. Our plainclothes team of more than a hundred men engaged in street fighting with the enemy, which was especially heroic. After holding out for several hours, they annihilated more than a hundred enemies before retreating to a certain location. The enemy troops were extremely panicked by this attack and showed signs of retreating.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Ambushed in Dan County</p>
<p>Also, the day before yesterday morning, more than three hundred enemy troops in Dan County, riding in eight armored vehicles, led by the traitor Wu, set out for the Leji market in the county. Our guerrilla unit Liang detected this and laid an ambush near Longgang, planting landmines. At around 10 a.m., the enemy vehicles drove in single file. With a loud bang, three enemy vehicles detonated the landmines, and the enemy soldiers' limbs flew everywhere. Our guerrillas on both sides jumped up and attacked the enemy. The remaining enemy soldiers did not dare to fight and fled in panic. In this battle, more than fifty enemies were annihilated, and a large number of military supplies were captured. Our side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Fire in Shaoguan Destroys More Than Ten Shops</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] At around 10 p.m. last night (the 15th), a fire broke out in a shop on Minsheng Road in Shaoguan. The fire spread rapidly and quickly engulfed more than ten shops before it was extinguished. The losses were quite heavy. This was an unprecedented fire in Shaoshi, second only to the enemy's brutal bombing.</p>
<h3>Authorities Issue Order Banning Enemy Counterfeit Currency, Those Who Violate Will Be Punished as Traitors</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Special Dispatch) The Guangdong Provincial Authorities, because the enemy has recently suffered military defeats and is focusing on economic sabotage, have sent a large number of cold-blooded elements to bring counterfeit currency into the occupied areas to exchange for legal tender. With the foundation of our legal tender solid, this move will not damage it in the slightest. However, the enemy's vicious intentions and the shameless behavior of traitors cannot be taken lightly. An order has now been issued to strictly prohibit the use and circulation of counterfeit currency. Those who violate it will be punished as traitors.</p>
<h3>The Impeachment Case of County Chief Zhang Hui, All Circles in Zhongshan Request Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Communication] All sectors of the population in Zhongshan, including district chiefs and commanders of various guerrilla detachments in the Sixth District, believe that the impeachment of County Chief Zhang Hui by the Provincial Assembly does not fully reflect the facts. They have jointly sent telegrams to the Provincial Authorities, the Zhongshan Training Committee in Chongqing, and the First District Administrative Office, requesting a thorough investigation and withdrawal of the case. The text of the telegrams from various popular organizations is as follows: Our county is located on the coast, bordering the ocean. Since the War of Resistance, the situation has been tense. Fortunately, with the virtuous leadership of County Chief Zhang, our homeland has been preserved. However, recently, we read in the newspaper that thirteen members of the Provincial Assembly, including Huang Yanchang, have filed an impeachment. While we admire the members' efforts to cleanse the government, it seems that they are still unaware of the actual situation in Zhongshan in recent years. Although Member Zhu, who seconded the motion, is a native of the county, he has always lived in Guangzhou and is not familiar with the county's affairs. The facts may be based on one-sided hearsay. County Chief Zhang is an advanced member of the party and the country. Although he has been unfairly treated, it will not detract from his reputation. However, we are concerned that it will distort the truth and hinder county administration during the war. Lanfen and others are representatives of legal organizations in the county and are not private individuals of the county chief. We dare to advocate for fairness and jointly request a thorough investigation and withdrawal of the case to avoid confusing the public. We anxiously await your response. Tan Lanfen, Standing Committee Member of the Zhongshan County Public Property Management Committee, Li Delian, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, etc., respectfully kowtow, and omit further printing.</p>
<h3>Female Soldiers Active in Foshan, The Enemy Loses Courage Because of Them</h3>
<p>(Nanhai Communication) Our brave guerrillas are implementing a strategy of using enemy-occupied areas as the front line and engaging in in-depth activities. Recently, a team of female guerrillas was discovered, who repeatedly gave public speeches in various teahouses in Foshan City to encourage resistance. They appear and disappear mysteriously, and the enemy army has no way of knowing their whereabouts. On the 13th of this month, our female guerrillas appeared again in Qingjunxu in the city, all carrying hand grenades, light machine guns, pistols, etc., to punish a certain store that traded with the enemy. When the enemy army heard the news and rushed to the scene, the female soldiers immediately dispersed and opened fire. For a time, gunshots were very frequent in the city. The enemy army was wounded and retreated while fighting. Our guerrillas, with their mission completed, did not pursue and returned to their base. After this battle, the enemy army lost courage.</p>

<h3>Small Basketball Dispute, Chunfeng Team Disagrees with Referee, Appeals to the Association with a Letter Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the final of this year's B Division Men's Basketball Tournament, Chunfeng played against Pui Ying on the 7th of this month. At the end of the game, Chunfeng won, but afterwards, it was discovered that the portrait in the registration form of the Chunfeng player He Lizhang did not match the portrait in the photo. After the on-duty members present carefully inspected it, they unanimously believed that He Lizhang, who played, was definitely not He Lizhang who registered. Later, the association sent a letter to Chunfeng, canceling the two points of the game and declaring Pui Ying the winner. However, yesterday, Chunfeng disagreed with the previous ruling and appealed to the association with a letter. The content of the letter stated that He Lizhang, who played that night, was indeed He Lizhang who originally registered. 2. When a replacement was discovered, the game should be stopped immediately and should not be raised after the game was over. 3. The association's cancellation of its winning results was innocent. It is reported that after receiving the letter, the association decided to hold a meeting at the Journalists Association at 1 p.m. today to discuss it.</p>
<h3>South China Southern Expedition Football Team Defeats Xinghua Four to Three</h3>

<h3>Deng Longguang Issues a Decree to Transfer a Large Army, Three-Way Counterattack on Jiangmen and Xinhui, Ma Shaoping Obeys Orders to Intensify Guerrilla Activities</h3>
<p>Actions Have Already Begun and Repeated Gains Have Been Made in Recent Days</p>
<p>(Changsha Express News) According to military news, Deng Longguang, the former General Commander of the Western Route, considering that the enemy entrenched in Jiangmen and Xinhui is actively promoting various poisonous policies, threatening and enticing our people to organize pushing teams to drive them to the battlefield, forcing our troops to kill each other, which is extremely hateful, decided to use the greatest strength to implement a full-scale counterattack and thoroughly eliminate the stubborn enemy. He has now issued a decree to transfer a certain two units of the Guangxi Army stationed in Kai (Ping) and He (Cheng), dividing them into three routes to advance towards Jiangmen and Xinhui. As soon as the order is given, a full-scale assault can be launched.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing the strength of the regular army on the periphery, our army's counterattack plan also decided to expand the enemy's rear guerrilla warfare on the inside and outflank the enemy from inside and outside, so that the enemy could not take care of both ends. Ma Shaoping, the commander of the Fifth District Guerrilla Column, was ordered to mobilize and intensify his activities and has already achieved some results. (1) At around 10 p.m. on the 12th, a certain guerrilla unit of more than 30 men each [blank] hand grenades, broadswords, and pistols to attack the enemy camp in Taicheng, killing ten enemy sentries. (2) On the same day at 1 a.m., more than 50 men attacked the enemy's stables at the Kui Shan Hall, killing several enemy soldiers and more than ten war horses. (3) On the 12th, several hand grenades were thrown by our daredevils on the second floor of the Pengjiang Hotel in Jiangmen. (4) A certain other team, in conjunction with the Beijie strongmen, attacked the Beijie enemy fort on the 12th, seized an enemy machine gun, and killed more than ten enemies. (5) Dozens of daredevils from a certain team attacked the Fanluogang enemy camp on the 13th, destroying dozens of lengths of enemy barbed wire and electrical wires, and burning down an enemy watchtower. Now our guerrillas in Jiangmen and Xinhui have launched a large-scale guerrilla posture, giving the enemy a lot of blows. It is reported that there are currently about a thousand enemy troops and about three hundred puppet troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui, but they are all a motley crowd with weak strength. Two enemy shallow-water warships and about 20 speedboats are docked on the Beijie Sea surface, shining searchlights every night to prevent our air force from attacking, which is extremely panic-stricken.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army in Sanshui Has No Abnormal Movements, Enemy Planes Practicing, One Crashes and Burns</h3>
<p>Putting on an Act</p>
<p>(Xijiang Express News) According to intelligence yesterday, the enemy troops entrenched in Xinan, Gangban, and Hekou in Sanshui have been frequently mobilized in recent days, increasing or decreasing, in order to hide from our army's attack and reduce the enemy and puppet's chances of counterattacking. From the 9th to the 11th, the enemy in Hekou Xinxu fired artillery shells at our Qingqi Old Sanshui area, intermittently and continuously throughout the day. However, according to reports from our front-line troops, the artillery shells fired by the enemy every day were all blank shells with no live ammunition, so we suffered no losses. It is speculated that its intention is to save ammunition, but it is also afraid of our attack, so it is putting on an act to suppress the military's morale and contain our army's counterattack.</p>
<p>Enemy Plane Self-Immolates</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. on the 10th, five enemy seaplanes took off from Hekou Airport for practice. Two of the planes collided suddenly due to poor handling. One plane caught fire on the spot and then fell. Many citizens in the southwest also witnessed it. After the plane caught fire, it fell into the Hekou sea. One enemy pilot parachuted and survived. Two of them were unable to escape and died with the plane.</p>
