<p>社評</p>
<h3>捷克亡國的教訓</h3>
<p>捷克可說完全亡國了。十九日德軍在加布倫斯將軍領導之下巡行布希米亞城歷二小時之久，巡行部隊有步兵，砲兵，唐克車隊，及飛機隊，極盡耀武揚威之能事，德軍儼然以征服者的姿勢，强逼捷克政府要員與德國軍政當局同座參觀，而捷克人民則多避入鄉村散步，或遠離窻牖，不願眼看德軍的巡行，其敵愾的情緒及內心的悲痛，可以想見。這樣歷史事實，含蓄着極豐富而深刻的敎訓，，在我們中國同胞，更不能等閒視之。</p>
<p>而然而捷克亡國悲痛的情緒，人民重於政府當局，而其責任則政府當局應較人民大過十百倍。今日捷克政府要員還和德國軍政當局同座參觀征服者的德軍的巡行，而捷克人民則不但不忍見德軍之示威，且有抗不堅旗慶賀的。我們還能淸晰囘憶去年九月間德軍侵入捷克時，捷克人民之如何慷慨堅决，願在政府領導之下驅德軍出離捷境，但是結果，貝奈斯總統的熱情完全被埋葬了，希洛維獨眼將軍以次妥協者的主張完全勝利了。這種勝利却給捷克留下了今日完全亡國的禍根，捷克人民那能不搥心悲痛哩！</p>
<p>當時有些論客認為捷克不抵抗尙可苟延時間，抵抗必更早亡。但是就現在的事實看，捷克苟延這半載的光陰，究有多少代價呢？何况抵抗不見得就亡國，卽令終必亡國，其時間亦必比這半年長，捷克人民的內心亦必無此說不出的悲痛。中國古訓「寧為玉碎，不為瓦全」，就是今日捷克人民懊恨的寫照。</p>
<p>其次，坐大德國侵略的責任應該完全由英法兩國負責。在英法兩國的當局者，的確認識當時的情勢除强逼捷克忍辱割地外並無別種方法可以避免戰爭；他們並且夢想着這樣慷他人之慨得希特勒的諾言，就可以一勞永逸了。殊不知「明興協定」的締結，英法完全上了德國的當。不特今日事實已經證明希特勒的「侵略」野心是無止境的，卽就當時的事勢論，英法能維持信義强硬對德，則羽毛未豐內正多事的「納粹」德國，未必敢卽胃險到底。兵家所言「避實擊虛的道理，在希特勒已有深刻的了解，德國現在不敢西進而儘先完成東進的計劃，就是根據這種道理。不過，德軍若東進成功之後，自國力量已漸强大，物質之供給亦漸足用，則轉矛西向以圖其七八年來「第三帝國」的幻夢，自是意料中事。在英法當局現在或許還料想德國吞幷了東歐諸小國之後的對象是蘇聯，那末英法永久可以做璧上觀，或竟幻想着一個漁人得利的機會。但依我們的觀察。希特拉絕對不會那樣傻幹，悍然和石壁相碰，他依然是要避實擊虛，進攻始終貪圖着沒有代價的和平的國家。</p>
<p>現在「納粹」東征十字軍，必將繼續東進，據羅馬尼亞大使對英外相哈里法克斯的報告，巳有德軍四十四師準備東開，其中一半已集中於捷克，其餘一半也在德國調動中。又據羅馬尼亞當局的報吿，德軍已由斯洛伐克開入小俄羅斯省，有向羅馬尼亞進攻的模樣。同時，希特拉的傳聲筒戈林，又在狂吹；「德國有此英雄的軍人人——指希特勒——必須有英雄的民族為其後盾」。依此推論，「英雄的軍人」如果併吞了東歐，「英雄的民族」將必征服世界。當戈材大贊「我們的領袖」如何如何偉大，如何如何光榮，並極言；「吾人大事物，方足以報答領袖」的時候，捷克人聽了固然更加悲痛，東歐各國聽了也必不寒而慄，只不知英法當局對德國這樣狂妄作何感想哩！</p>
<p>東歐諸小國要不再踏捷克亡國的覆轍，惟有及早準備强力作積極的抵抗一條路。凡是被侵略民族，欲求生存，就只須抵抗到底。英法要阻止侵略者的前進，造成反噬的禍根，就要及早用全副武裝向侵略者忠吿。對侵略者忠告未必就引起戰爭，「武裝和平」在羽毛未豐的侵略者，依然是可以適用的。英法且已不能再存德國更東進侵逼蘇聯的幻想。因為「納粹十字軍」的進征是很有嚴格的界限的。聞英內閣已決定與各和平國家加緊聯絡，以應付此歐洲新局勢，英政府還有人主張英美法蘇開一會議。這是可喜的消息，希望能更具體化。</p>
<h3>蘇聯紅軍怎樣與人民合作</h3>
<p>— 蘇聯騎兵大元帥布登尼作　梅真譯自「莫斯科新聞」</p>
<p>史達林同志在莫斯科蘇維埃會議的慶祝大會上，會向蘇聯忠勇紅軍致詞說：</p>
<p>『關於軍隊與人民之間友愛與親密的關係，世界上沒有一個地方可以與我們條聯相比的。在我們國內，軍隊受着愛戴，受着尊敬，並且普遍地為人民所關切。為什麽能够這樣呢？因為工農大衆曾經創造了他們自己的軍隊，這個軍隊不是為主人，而是為從前的奴隸，現在被解放了的工人與農民服務，這在世界上還是第一次。』</p>
<p>紅軍，偉大的社會主義革命勝利的屏陣，與保衛者，是與我們社會主義祖國的一切人民用血統關係連系着的。蘇聯人民的統一，和紅軍是配備着一切現代的作戰工具道一事實，是對於法西斯侵略者的一個嚴重的警告——就是在資產階級的報紙中，也不能不承認這一事實，這種統一，這種蘇聯人民與其車隊間的親密關係，對於新的世界戰爭的煽動者，並沒有什麽秘密；他們也知道這一事實，所有資本主義世界的勞苦大衆，亦以最偉大的同情，關切着勝利的社會主義祖國，和十月革命的軍隊。</p>
<p>蘇聯紅軍經常的任務</p>
<p>蘇聯經常被資本主義國家包圍著的這個事實，使蘇聯人民痛切認清：經常負擔著防衛的任務，經常注視著蘇聯防衛力量之增强，是非常必要的，因此對於更加提高紅軍的戰鬥力，對于從組織上和技術上去增强紅軍力量的關係，對於蘇聯人民是非常重要的。</p>
<p>第一第二兩個史達林五年計劃的完成，把蘇聯變為一個最强大的工業國家：新的工業在城市中發展，如在鄉村中發展一樣，對於蘇聯的國防，己成為一個重大的基礎。</p>
<p>當第一個五年計劃的時候，紅軍的技術配備便已經完全改造了，由於他有組織的軍隊構造，以及他軍隊的軍事訓練，他已經變成第一等的軍隊。甚至敵人也不得不承認他的强大和威力，和他的武器的高度水準。</p>
<p>紅軍前進的技術配備，使他成為世界上佔第一位的强有大的軍隊。社會主義的工業，是正在供給紅軍以自動武器，各種各樣的機關槍和重砲。</p>
<p>當內戰時期，紅軍所配備著的，只是從敵人手裏奪來的戰利品，坦克車。但是，今天，紅軍已有各種各樣的成千成萬的坦克車。所有這一切坦克車，都是在蘇聯自己的工廠，用蘇聯自己的材料製造的。</p>
<p>蘇聯的航空及其成功，已佔有世界上不少的紀錄。由蘇聯工程師和工人製造的成千成萬的最新式的飛機，各種設計的飛機——超速轟炸機，速飛驅逐機，偵察及攻擊機，以及其他類似的飛機，——己經大大地提高了紅軍的戰鬥力。</p>
<p>聯共的領導作用</p>
<p>紅軍是由布爾塞維克黨領導着的，這是他最基本的有利條件。在內戰中保証了决定的勝利，便是這種黨的領導作用。在那時候，共產黨的三十萬　員，或者他的全體黨員的百份之六十五，都是在各方前綫担任過戰鬥的。那時偉大的無產階級革命領袖列寧，就站在國防的最前綫。列寧和史達林製定而且實現了對於紅軍一切重大戰役的計劃。决定蘇維埃共和國的命運的幾次戰役，如在査里欽，白爾　，彼得格勒等戰役，使鄧尼金和郎格爾潰敗的各次戰役，都是由史達林同志所計細，而且是在他的領導之下進行的。紅在內戰中之所以勝利，是因為在反抗敵人响苦戰中的共產黨，在發展卓越的布爾什維克的無產階級指揮幹部方面，已經獲得成功。</p>
<p>從前的機械師，歷史悠久的布爾塞維克黨員伏　希　夫，便是具有這種天才的軍人。在內戰時，他指揮了一個由　幹斯克工人所組織的小小的分隊。但在今天，他已經是蘇聯的第一個元帥。一羣偉大的軍人——富隆茲，廈伯陽，施谷爾，郭多夫斯基稽費茲，和其他等人，也是同負盛名。</p>
<p>紅軍之成為不可戰勝的力量，是因為他具有如此優秀的政治領導者，如像列寧，史達林，莫洛托夫，加里寧，富隆茲，伏羅希洛夫，奧爾卓尼克茨，基洛夫，卡關諾維支，米高陽，，安得列也夫，石加鄧柯和麥克利斯，都曾經參加紅軍的政治訓練。</p>
<p>當代表的英勇</p>
<p>軍隊中黨代表對於軍隊中政治活動的組織，與夫自我犧牲的那種英雄事業，在紅軍的勝利當中自然起了特別重大的作用。由布爾塞維克黨遣送到軍隊中的這些黨代表，把黨的精神，黨在××階級革命鬥爭中的紀律和英勇，一同帶給他們。</p>
<p>紅軍在內戰之後，所有技術的配備和訓練，就已提高到一個非常高的水準，要以那一年代紅軍的配備和訓練來與現在的情形相比，自然是不可能的。伏羅希洛夫也曾說過：</p>
<p>『我們堅定的相信，如果所有這一切的技術，能為我們在紅軍隊伍中的優秀幹部，能為我們的布爾塞維克黨員，工人，農民，偵探人員，能為我們卓越的戰士，能為我們光榮的步兵，騎兵，砲兵，戰車兵，機械師，飛行家、水兵，能為願意建立社會主義國家的這个偉大國家的工人，集體農場農民的全部力量與布爾塞維克的堅持性所擴大——　其結果是會成為任何干涉者所不能抵禦的一種勢力。」</p>
<p>世界×國主義企圖以武力來試驗蘇聯這種力量已經不祇一次了。蘇聯人民决不會忘記一九二九年由日本軍隊的挑釁所發生的對於蘇聯邊境區域的侵入，如草　與與張鼓峯的企圖一樣。這種企圖已經為紅軍部隊所給予的致命打擊所制止。</p>
<p>根據他們自己的經騐，日本×國主義已經有機會去了解，關於他武力的性能和數量，以及他的軍隊的軍事準備方面，紅軍已經成為第一等的軍隊。</p>
<p>一九二九年，機械化的配備為平均在工農紅軍隊伍中的每一個人具有二·六匹馬力、而一九三三年的數字，就提高到七·七匹馬力，在最近五年間，更有了驚人的增長。我們今天的來復槍師，在他的組織，技術配備和戰門力方面，已經列入最　進的這種隊伍當中。</p>
<p>紅軍的強大力量，不僅依賴於他的組織和裝備，而最重要的是依賴於他的人員，我們紅軍的幹部，首先是毫不自私的尊重祖國和黨以及具有超凡的軍事性能的布爾塞維克的幹部。各軍區司令，各軍團，各師，各旅和各團的部隊長，幾乎完全部是布爾塞維克黨的黨員，百分之七十五的尉官，上尉和校官，都是共產黨員和少共的團員，紅軍的人員，是貢獻他一切能力和知識於祖國的强盛與進步的勇敢而前進的人民。</p>
<p>在他們之間，有無數優秀的飛行家，勇敢的潜水艇兵，無長的戰車兵與騎兵。最近五年間，大約有四千个部隊長，政治工作人員，工程師，技術兵和紅軍的士兵，接受了政府的動章。</p>
<p>俄國軍人的勇敢，是久已有名的。歷史曾經紀錄了證明俄國軍力這種崇高性質的不少例子。世界最偉大的軍人之一，蘇伏洛夫領導下的俄國軍隊的英勇鬥爭，便是盡人皆知的證據。</p>
<p>當俄國軍隊獲得了對於久享不可戰勝之名的普魯士王的一連串重要勝利的時候，他們是在七年戰爭之中獲得了盛名。在白刃戰中，俄國軍人的驍勇，他的忍耐性，以及他對於祖國的熱愛，這些性質更是久已著名於世的。</p>
<p>保持光榮的傳統</p>
<p>他們的前輩曾經為爭取目由和平與蘇聯人民的快樂而流血的紅軍人員，具有卓越的軍事性能，紅軍人員决不會喪失他們的前輩所獲得的成績的。</p>
<p>蘇聯人民與紅軍之間的統一，以及具不可分解的血統關係，是這個國家的防禦力量的眞實的保證。法西斯侵略者如果冒險，則他們將要進行不僅反對紅軍，而同時是反對一萬七千萬以上全體蘇聯人民的戰爭</p>
<p>我們國家中最近的事態，向各方面最有力的證明了這件事。讓我們來說喀山湖的事件，說一說加入紅軍服務的號召，最後至於紅軍部隊秩序的戰略演習吧—在任何的地方，在一切遭遇中，人們都可以遇見蘇聯人民及其紅軍之統一的一幅非常鮮明的圖畫。</p>
<p>當　態正在醞釀的那些緊張的日子中，全國的注意都集中在喀山湖的。可以說，從七月廿九日至八月十一日之間，這一些作得紀念的日子當中，這個國家的每一個國民，都已視他目己為已被動員了的，為紅軍隊伍中的一個戰士。而在這些日子當中，紅軍人員勇敢地在喀山湖區域為他們的社會主義祖國而戰鬥，在社會主義國家的國防使命上、提高到一國未有先例的自我犧牲之英雄主義的最高峯。蘇聯的報紙告訴過我們，有怎樣多的請求是由在喀山湖作戰之戰十的弟兄同胞發出的，要求把他們派入紅軍隊伍中去代替他的兄弟。</p>
<p>正式征調的日子</p>
<p>蘇聯的靑年公民，把他們調進紅軍的日子，認為是他們生活中最快樂的日于之一，他們以為他們自己爭取成為一个工農紅軍的戰士這種高尚職業的志願，而去向敵人開火。正式征調的日子，不僅對於那些被征　服務的人，而同樣的卽對於他們的家屬。也是一个舉行慶祝的時機。</p>
<p>在蘇聯，千萬的青年，因為久已夢想到進入他們已非一日準備為這種高尚榮　而加入紅軍，而進入了軍隊，成成伏羅希洛夫射擊手，騎兵兵士。航空傘降落兵和飛機師。</p>
<p>千百的靑年民衆，獲得勞動國防動章的準備授予，而無數的射手，飛機師，戰車兵，是正逐年的單獨在史達林汽車廠受著訓練。</p>
<p>所有這一切，貢獻看一個美滿的解釋予記載在史達林憲法中的這些條文：</p>
<p>「在工農紅軍中服軍役，是蘇聯公民一個光榮的義務。」</p>
<p>人民歡迎紅色戰士</p>
<p>紅軍的戰略演習，在任何地方都是一個真正的人民紀念日。在演習期間，地方的人民，分擔了一部份戰士的責任，集體農場的農民，成為幫助尋路，覓井以及其他等事的引導者。</p>
<p>紅軍與人民之間的密切與統一，是由史達林憲法第一百三十八條保證著的。憲法一三八曾經規定：「在紅軍中服務的公民，在與其他公司平等的條件下，在選舉權和被選舉權。」當最高委員會議選出無數的軍人充當代表之時，各蘇維埃共和國的人民曾經宣示過他們對於紅軍的熱愛和信任。</p>
<p>由於享受人民無限的支持，在受着愛戴的蘇聯元帥伏羅希洛夫的領導之下，紅軍巳經成為全世界不可戰勝的軍隊。如像喀山湖戰役一類的事變，不祇一次的顯示出，全世界是沒有能够抵抗全體蘇聯人民支持看的紅軍的武力的。</p>
<p>沒有任何法西斯關於「衝鋒隊」和「電擊隊」的理論，能够在蘇聯領土內獲得證實或實現的。敵人是會要受殘酷的打擊的，不管他能應用什麼理論或什麼武器。</p>
<p>軍隊由一個壓力和征服的武力，轉變為一個為工農大衆利益的保衛者，轉變為一個與人民親近，而受着人民愛戴的保衛者，還在人類歷史上還是第一次。這樣一種軍隊，這種社會主義國家的武裝力量，是能够在任何時間和任何國際情勢下，保衛他的祖國，以及他所担負的使命——社會主義建設的使命，為全世界最偉大的軍人史達林所領導著的蘇聯人民的使命的</p>
<h3>從重慶到成都</h3>
<p>三月二日上午十時從重慶坐軍用車出發，三日下午四時卽抵成都，全程計五百三十公里，沿途都是山嶺，重慶附近多崇山絕壁，離重慶境後，則為連線不絕的丘陵，到離成都三十公里的地方，又有一大山嶺，路如羊腸，汽車上山下山，都是鑽在斷崖絕壁中，假如半個不小心，車子翻個筋斗，那就一切都是天晚得了爬過了這高山，則是豁然開朗，一望無涯的大平原了。而成都，就是在這平原的中央，同時過了此山，風也忽兒括得很大，刺骨的冷起來了，據說，這是從西安那邊括來的大風。</p>
<p>沿途路經永川，榮昌，內江，資中，簡陽等　境，路途巖石間，都有「軍民合作，抗戰到底」，「肅淸漢奸」，「殺滅倭寇」，「抗戰必勝建國必成』的標語，有積極的抗戰標語的，算是榮昌縣境，那見有『鞏固擴大抗日民族統一戰綫」，「防糾漢奸妥協言論」，「服務兵役是國民的義務」，「逃避兵役是犯罪的行為」等標語，書在旁邊的題字團體是抗×後援會歌詠團，在農村，像這樣的標語，是很必要的，偶然也看到「要實行新生活，先要不吃大煙」的標語，由此可知鴉片也許還糜毒着四川的農村。</p>
<p>第一日，我們在永川縣境的來鳳鎭吃中飯；鎭很小，都是木造平房，飯舘都貼着紅紙春聯，聯語都是抗戰的，農村飯店的為「農工商學兵聯合去破侵略計，村市城鄉鎭大家來唱太平歌」，瑞芳茶園的為「此仇豈共戴天願將士舍身成仁殺盡×人方罷手，與賊蓄不兩立擁領袖抗戰到底還我山河始甘心」，其他還有許多，不贅錄。</p>
<p>這個鎭裏，乞丐特別多，他們的樣子，十足的像用樹葉蔽體的原始人一樣瑟瑟縮縮的站在飯館門前，等客人吃完了，卽刻蜂擁進去，向茶房爭搶殘餘。</p>
<p>從這鎮繼續前進為榮昌縣，再進卽為內江縣，離縣城不遠，有內江，不寬，水也很淺，但未建橋，車至此，必坐拖船渡過，在此軍運繁忙時候，這實在是一種取大的損失。</p>
<p>車到內江縣城，停下宿夜，一切來往渝榕之間的汽車，必在這裏停宿，我們的奉因載貨過重，走得慢，到這裏時，已過了九點，從重慶來的，從成都來的車子，塞滿了街巷，我們的車子幾乎沒有地方停，旅館更不易找了，吃過飯，好容易找到一個小房于，寬約五尺，長約六尺，有一張板床，麥桿做氈子，一條薄而髒的棉被，此外什麽都沒有了窗，子寬約一尺，長約二尺，用四條木條當窗柱，因不熟悉地方治安如何，我呌汽車的衛兵用躺椅打舖在我房子裏睡，車夫和另外兩個人，則到他們認識的旅館裏去商量打舖睡覺。</p>
<p>第二天早晨六時三刻。繼續起行，下午一時，到資中縣的球溪鎭停下吃中節，東西也不便宜，鴨旦賣三角錢四個出內江　城，見一大木牌上書「四川省農產促進所甘蔗實驗區」，從此直到資中，翩一重山又一重山，眼睛所能望得到的，都是一片綠一片黃，綠的是麥子，大豆。蔬菜，黃的是菜花，是甘蔗收獲後種的吧。看這情形，農產極為豐富，據土人說，四川大豆，僅次于東北，四川豐收一年，足供幾年之用云，碉堡各縣境都有，但以內江為最多，據說是土防匪的。</p>
<p>資中縣述來便是簡陽縣，山野已不全是一片綠一片黃，有許多山頭荒着在那裏了。到了離成都三十公里的大山嶺附近，農產似乎又豐富起來連山頂都種着東西，翻過山就是一片綠油油的平原，不用說農產也是豐富的了。走過江浙，走過兩廣，再走到這樣的地方來，才開始眞正感覺到中國的地大物博，假如各倫陷區的游擊戰能够支持與發展，就單是以四川一省為抗日根據地，相信抗戰都可以得到最後的勝利了。何况還有西南西北許多省呢。</p>
<p>路上所見，人口極疏極疏，偶而看到三數民家，都是茅房，女人在中年以下的。都剪髮衣也較整齊：男子則皆穿破燜土布籃長袍，纏腰帶，用白布纏着頭，只露出頭項，過了內江縣，則男男女女，老老少少，都用白布纏頭了。</p>
<p>到了成都人民風習似乎又是不同了</p>

<h3>隨棗之行</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>訪陳離將軍</p>
<p>從隨縣乘車折返襄樊時，在××地方訪問第×××師師長陳離將軍。前年九月　由後方　往山西太原附近作戰，十二月又東開蘇北，當任津浦北段第一線指揮，至去年三月九日開始與×軍接觸。記得蔣委員長在十年前北伐時，，因恨日軍在濟南橫加阻難，曾有十年後誓必殲滅日軍於台兒莊的壯語，誠以台兒莊確具有這樣的一個優越形勢，不過先要魯南滕縣那一線守牢，引×入榖。陳師長當日便肩承了這重大任務，由肯犧牲，不惜犧牲的壯烈犧牲，甚至連他本人腿部帶了重傷，均在所不計，卒能完成守牢滕縣，引×入彀的使命。雖然第二線指揮王銘章師長，不幸被×迂迴，力戰殉國，可是終亦無害於台兒莊殲滅戰的大勝利。</p>
<p>×機眞會倒蛋—我和陳師長見面，剛起頭談着鄂北鄂中的戰局，×機就如大綠蒼蠅似的，嗡嗡飛來擾人。靑年軍法官大塊頭楊電如先生，硬來約我們去一道河堤下面躲避。然而楊先生幷不胆小，他　蹲在堤上，　揚着右掌瞭望：『三架——，——哦！打轉灣了，眞有點糟糕，恐怕要那個話了！』彷彿在打電話似的不斷俯身向堤下報道着。</p>
<p>陳師長在場下繼續着先時的談話，由湖北戰况，談到×我整個情勢的對比，歷舉事實數字，證明我較×人優越的條件，實在很多。我們應當轉為應用這些優越條件，以百折不撓的精神，和×人週旋到底。在戰役上有一次失敗，便增了二次經騐，我們仍然可以趕快對×作二次，三次，以至無數次的嚴重打擊，總要打得它無法下台，我們才能得到最後勝利。</p>
<p>他說：綜觀第一期抗戰，×人難然在陣地上打了若干勝仗，但它們自此深入我內地山林區域，一面减少機械化部隊效用，一面延長後方，輸交通線，使後方增加極大威脅，正面作戰更喪失其已往力量，充分給予我們以迎頭擊破的機會。同時，在我內部，水淸魚自現，為了爭取長期抗戰時間之獲得，逐漸肅淸了內部疑貳分子，得在政治經濟各方面力求順利的進步，以配合軍事需要上的積極進展，擅都是對抗戰建國大業的非常有利的徵兆。</p>
<p>——誠然，×軍在初期作戰時，在某些地方來勢汹汹，倒有幾分「一鼓作氣」的樣子。後來經通徐州大會戰，武漢大會戰之後，絡續現出「再衰二竭一的原形：山西「掃蕩游擊」　　　　緊；湘鄂狼奔豕突，毫無寸　；廣州畫地自限，不敢　越雷池一步；瓊島雖　　　預發陸，無異暫時吞下一顆國際炸彈——這都是說明×勢科表三竭，行見　斃的一些　　。</p>
<p>至於我們內部方面，政府中絕不會再找出一個秦檜來，前線上却是忠心　日誓　版　的　萬岳飛，我們所以對抗戰前途不悲觀，幷不是沒有把握的。</p>
<p>襄樊前線的陳離師長</p>

<h3>向回國服務的僑胞敬禮</h3>
<p>昨日晚報載稱南洋積城僑胞組織的技術人員回國服務隊，巳於日前到達香港，而新加坡華僑救國隊二百零八名，歸國服務，亦已安抵西貢，於十八十九二日分批由西買經河內入廣西雲南，服務於名種工業。這些消息使我們感到無法比賽的歡欣和興　！</p>
<p>抗戰　在迅速轉入第二階段，我們如果不能迅速加强前綫的戰鬥力，發展×後的游擊戰和培植後方的新生力量，則不僅不能達到　盡××獲得最後勝利，而且還不能阻止××無限的深入，、還不能挽救民族最後滅亡。我們如果要確切迅速完成上述三種緊急的任務，則首在實行全國國民精神總動員，實行全中華民族所有生動力量的總動員，不過鑒於抗戰二十餘月以來國內同胞之慘遭屠殺蹂躪而元氣大喪，以及內地同胞潛伏力量發動實現之匪可期以一朝一夕，故所望於我海外僑胞者，實屬異重大與迫急，我海外僑胞民族意識特別强烈，而且負有救助祖國的光榮傳統，當此祖國為爭求獨立自由而進入嚴重階段之際，所望於我們僑胞之發揚自尊心與自信心而踴躍來効者自更覺殷切！</p>
<p>因此我們除了對於業經囘國服務的僑胞，謹在這裏致其最崇高最親熱的民族革命敬禮以外，一方面還望海外輿論界敎育界多多以此鼓勵僑胞，一方面並望政府速定整個計劃，對於僑胞囘國服務，特別予以獎勵。同時，我們尙有不能巳於言者：第一，是根據國內各地通訊所描寫的實際情形，希望政府在集中領導下切實保障民衆救亡運動的自由，而對於一切阻礙民運的黨派成見，頑固份子，和潜伏的妥協親日份子的言論行動，應司予以流底的清掃。第二，鹽於港澳及其他特殊區域內·尚有許多僑胞及青年，不知亡國恥辱，　其奢侈浪漫的腐化生活，甚至還有民族叛徒逃避國法，散放謠言謬論，以為日×張目，而破壞我國團結抗戰的，這種敗類叛徒和漢奸份子，實大有辱我僑胞光榮歷史，後者固為國家法令人類道德所不許，前者亦為有心肝有骨氣的僑胞所不能容忍，我們至少要用輿論的力　加以制裁。</p>
<h3>日軍的弱點</h3>
<p>— 世長</p>
<p>譯自莫檔科眞理報</p>
<p>我們從日本在中國作戰的形式看起來，日軍的行動是很機械化的，它的主要部隊往往集中於一指定的地點，日軍更慣於採取包圍行動，很少採取正面直接攻擊的戰術，以邁迫華軍退出固有的團地，日軍大部分都經過嚴密的訓練，尤其是關於進攻和夜襲的策略，機械化部隊和騎兵隊能够日行二十五英里，步兵隊每日也能行十八英里。</p>
<p>可是，日軍不擅長於面對面的肉搏戰爭；相反的，中國的軍隊擅長肉搏，這是人人知道的；日軍和華軍接近時，不能够抵當華軍的刺刀，試舉一個例：吧濟於寗去年中日兩軍人戰「，沿運河的兩岸，這是很緊張的戰爭，雙方的人馬，非常接近，除了大刀和刺刀以外，其他的軍器，部失去效用，所以，開戰後不久，日軍就支持不住而後退，死傷二千餘人。</p>
<p>日本派遣到中國作戰的軍隊，都備有坦克車，飛機和工程隊，在這種軍備上，華軍是遠不如日軍，但是，華軍並不氣餒，表現卓越的精神，勇武抗戰。予「皇軍」以嚴重的打擊！</p>
<p>日軍司令官對于華軍的力量，估計得太低了；他們以　華軍配置不良，訓練不佳，决不帶應付科學化的現代戰爭；因而，造成戰略上的大錯，現在日本在其中國佔領區內的駐軍，在人數上，是不够的，隨時有受到華軍襲擊的可能；日軍也何嘗不知，但是，實力單薄，軍隊不够分配，卽使在重要的交通綫沿路各地，也社能駐紥少數的軍隊，日軍後方的防禦，也不是完備適當的，日軍司令時常宣聲『勝利』，國內的×閥也相互呼應，」舉行慶祝會等，這不過是聊以自慰」朦薇國人，自欺欺人的舉動，究其內在的眞實情形，已達到危險的時期了。</p>
<p>日本可以調動的軍隊，究有多少。各方的意見異殊，外國報紙的估計。也各有不同，據中·英·法三方面的統計，到一九三八年十二月三十一日為止，日軍包括部隊一百二十萬人，砲四千五百尊，坦克車一千八百　，飛機二千架，這是此較可靠的統計數字。</p>
<p>日本軍隊的百分之八十，是從　民階級抽調出來的，而軍官大部分是職業的軍人，地主，和富有階級的人士，這次中日戰爭中，日軍充分的表現了卑鄙低落的道德，在佔領區域內的殺戮，搶劫，姦淫和其他不良行為，是日軍漫無紀律，缺乏良好道德的鐵證。</p>
<p>在外國報紙上，我們常常可以看到日軍反戰的報吿。實在的，日軍的反戰情緒，很是高張，往往有若干小部隊拒絕服從調赴前綫的命令；當然，此種反叛的軍隊發現後，立即就被槍决，在上海和南京、曾經有好幾批士兵，因為有「反叛」的活動，而被押到後方處罰；許多日本士兵，因為發生道類事情，而得刦降級的處罰；日本的海軍軍官，由於部下的拒絕服從命令；常常發生不少的困難。</p>
<p>在日本，許多人民往往假裝　患患病，或是忽然失踪，以避免參加軍役，在九州，曾經有一羣人民，被強迫徵集為後備隊，可是，他們都是反對戰爭的，因而，就發生叛變，自殺的情事，更是到處可以見到，被迫投軍，武裝　戰的人們，狂飲烈酒，吸食鴉片，以求暫時的忘却戰爭。</p>
<p>實在的，我們可以預料，戰爭一天一天的延長，今後日本的民心，和日軍的精神，是更會大見襄頺的。</p>

<h3>新都帶來的喜訊　陳炳權校長訪問記</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>李應霖，吳鼎新，陳炳權三大學校長赴渝出席第三次全國敎育會議，帶着敎育的新苗歸來，記者聞訊，昨天特地前往訪問，以謀有以饗諸讀者。雖然李吳二校長不在學校未得晤面，是一件憾事：但是陳炳權校長的滔滔一席談，已够令人歡欣雀躍了。</p>
<p>（一）沒有懷疑的餘地</p>
<p>首先，記者是叩詢報上尙未發表過的重慶以及中樞的一般大勢。陳校長說：在大會中，中樞有很多關于抗戰現勢的重要報吿，有些是屬於軍事上的秘密。未便公開。孔院長對於民主國家的借欵，王部長對於外交的分析，都有使人興奮的報道。何部長的報吿，有精密的數目字做根據，尤其令人增加抗戰一定得到最後勝利的信心。汪走，純粹是一個私人的行動，與大局絲毫沒有影響。無論從任何一方面看來，都可以欣慰自上至下，都在一個已定國策之下，有計劃地有步驟地埋頭苦幹。陳部長很積極地推動戰時敎育的實施，彭學沛亦照當任職。外傳辭職，扣留，種種謠言，全是×人挑撥離問的陰謀，而絕無其事。</p>
<p>陳校長還鄭重地說：在香港亦許有些人對於抗戰要發生幾分懷疑，以為亦許有人主張和平。可是，親自到了重慶之後，就可以恍然相信絕對沒有懷疑的餘地。在苦幹支持抗戰的氣氛籠罩之下，抗戰的前途是非常樂觀的。</p>
<p>（二）嚴肅代替荒淫，節約代替奢侈</p>
<p>在整個國策有把握，有辦法的發展中，我們戰時首都的風氣亦轉變過來。這個風氣的轉變，亦是最後勝利的一重保障。</p>
<p>三民主義靑年團是蓬蓬勃勃地活動起來。中央的愛護靑年，信任宵年，以及靑年的擁護政府，愛戴領袖，都是抗戰的炮火創造出來的奇蹟，而使人無限感奮的！</p>
<p>公務人員都嚴肅地奉公，一律禁止入娛樂場所。必要宴客時，中餐每席不能超過八元。西餐每位不能超過一元。最有趣的是「自助餐」。一具陶器，中間用竹片隔成四格，乘了四樣菜，另有湯，飯與水菓，每人一份只是五角錢的價値。這次，蔣委員長及其他長官獄宴出席會員，就是用這樣的「自助餐」。</p>
<p>——記者聆訊之下，好希望「禁止入娛樂埸所」與「自助餐」的風氣能够普遍於後方各地中產以上的階層。尤其是這裏香港。不這樣，是太對不起浴血抗戰的將士，與顛沛流連的同胞了。</p>
<p>（三）抗戰教育的新姿態</p>
<p>整個大局在好轉中，敎育亦有辦法了。這次在全國敎育會議中，已一致通過課程要適合戰時的需要。各級的課程標準，亦另組有委員會重新修改訂芷了。强化職業敎育，養成害用的技術人材，是當前迫切的要求，敎育部經己委托各大學兼辦各種專科訓練班，其類別有：會計，統計，電器，土木工程，等班。招收高中畢業生訓練二年畢業，授以適當工作。每班學生五十人，教育部每班每月津貼國幣一千元，現已開辦二十班頗有成績。其他各地各校亦在擴大推行中。</p>
<p>為保障作為立國之本的敎育得到永恆的發展，這次在會議中有一個重要的决議，就是：中央與地方的敎育經費，每年最低限度應增加十分之一。這是教育新生的一個重要關鍵。</p>
<p>失學與失業的學生與教職員按教部頒佈條例，在重慶都得兌現。戰區教職員登記後分派去工作的，已不知多少。現在，在重慶還有一千五百個登記的中小學敎師剛在受訓，主持人是敎部督學兼科長唐惜分氏。訓練畢業後將分派各地推動戰時義務教育。</p>
<p>——我們很希望各省，各地的負責當局，都切實地招待中央頒佈的條例。尤其是對於敎員與與生應該好好地安排。</p>
<p>陳敎育部長和陳校長的私人談話中，有一段是値得各校特別注意的：</p>
<p>「全國各級敎育設施應遵照三民主義敎育的最高原則之外，每圖學校無妨有每個學校的特點。或文，或理，或農，或工，或商，或醫，或……皆可視其學校歷史與已具的基礎發展其特長、至於每個學生，則應視其家庭背景，是都市，是農村，是華僑，是軍界……而滿足其需要，學生應靜，應動，應文應武……應使其個性得到正常的發展。」這是很正確的敎育理想；但是，後者有什麽具體的辦法司以促其實現呢？陳校長答記者謂：「對於學生的個別敎導，則要善甩導師制了。」從此，我們又可以看出「師資的健全」在敎育上的重要性了。</p>
<p>（四）一幅新的地圖</p>
<p>在重慶，有很多進步出片物；陳校長這次帶來軍委會政治部編製的「敵我全般態勢要圖」尤其値得重視。裏面，把×人佔領區域並不諱疾忌醫地用訂點標示出來。還有「我可行使政權區域」「我完整區域」都」目了然使我們看出×人佔領區域不僅不容易成為「線」；暫時失法的「點」還是有數。在廣大的國土上，二十個月來，很很多多還是依然無恙。看了這幅地圖之後，恍然醒覺我們的游擊隊以及正規軍襲擊×人的前線與後方，是絕對的可能。與想像到×人將來命運。是怎樣的危險！記者欣然向陳校長借來製電版，藉用眞憑實據來正吿一般悲觀的失敗主義者。可惜該圖太大，且甚詳細，製為電版時，必甚模糧，故將原擬作罷，殊為憾事！聞陳校長擬將呈中央准其翻印，記者謹祝其早日實現斯願。</p>
<p>附帶要報告的一個消息，就是陳校長等將定於本星期日邀約本港中等學校校長報吿此次出席會議經過，本文對于教育方面未能詳述者，就是候待下次再作有系統的報道。</p>

<p>查中順公路中之容奇段（前傳容良公路者實誤）係由大良至沙頭、不能直達容奇因沙頭與容奇隔一衣帶水、我團隊退出大良時、以容良路上無險可守、渡河至容奇、幸容奇原有第一游擊區第一別働隊袁帶部之第五支隊駐守、×未能再進，惟對海沙頭方面、于本月十七日、×由大良派兵進駐、據沙頭糖廠、隔河遙控容奇、大良×雖未舉進犯、而容奇形勢仍未稍弛、十七日×一度隔河以小炮機槍向容奇掃射、我軍起而應戰、互轟十餘分鐘、即行停止、至十八日、再次轟擊、我嚴守陣地、防共渡河、截至十九日止、×無再進逼企圖、</p>
<p>團隊增防　澈究失職</p>
<p>刻下我團隊集中容奇者、除原自大良退出者外、第一別働隊司令袁帶早由小欖增調一大隊、着參謀主任屈仁則率領、馳至容奇增防、本月十九日、袁司令復親由小欖率隊出發、鎭守容奇、其餘順屬各團隊、亦粉紛抵達、實力雄厚、進可以攻、退可以守、防務無虞、第一區行政專員古鼎華除指揮防務外、并着手査究當大良失陷時、團隊負責指揮長官、有無擅自退却、致部隊統率乏人、不能充份發揮抵抗力量情事、將報吿上峯、澈究失職人員、聞副司令陸領于大良失陷之夜、乘自備火輪「有德」號、駛往某地、至今仍未歸隊云、</p>
<p>容奇戒嚴　輪渡擁護</p>
<p>容奇境內、業經宣佈戒嚴、治安則極良好、團隊因×軍僅距一河面、故嚴禁船集團泊岸邊、惟石岐至容奇之新和利渡、及江門至容奇之興記渡、則因交通關係、准照常行走、不過各輪渡于夜間開返容奇時、須在半途停泊一宵、俟至天明、然後再駛容奇卸客貨、容奇桂洲及附近各鄉落、人民自動疏散、多赴中山新會暫、由容奇開出渡船、連日搭客異常擁擠、</p>
<h3>大良淪陷後　四邑強化保衛力量　金融交通粮食等項均加調整　中央核准豁免米稅每縣萬包</h3>
<p>自粵頃吿陷後【江門快訊】、四邑情勢轉變、×軍佔據九江河淸、最近復攻陷順德天良、屢有進犯四邑之企圖、現四邑已加緊動員民衆、並由第五區縱隊司令李務滋增編游擊隊於以强化保衛四邑力量、關四邑最近戰時之金融、交通、糧食等項之重要進行、分誌如下、</p>
<p>整理金融　禁折國幣</p>
<p>現台山、開平、新會、恩平等縣、以國幣與毫券比率、早經財政部規定為一四四、惟自廣州淪陷後、四邑人數驟增、同時國幣流通於四邑、更形暢旺、一般商店多改用國幣為本位、但竟有不肖商民、暗中低折國幣、對於農民銀行紙幣、尤為歧視、自應嚴為禁止、以維戰時金融、現各縣已發出布吿禁止、嗣後如發覺低折國幣情事、决以漢奸論罪、</p>
<p>各縣水陸　交通情况</p>
<p>順德大良再度被×攻陷江門情勢、亦吿緊張、日前航行三埠與澳門之大興業、禮和兩電輪、在陸洲遭劫後、四邑水陸交通益形影響、第五區縱隊司令部、為調節四邑戰時交通起見、經設立戰時航業合作社、以整理四邑水道交通、査江門至容奇之輪渡、日前停航後、昨亦已復航、其餘江門至三埠、及由三埠至澳門輪渡、均暢通如常、至四邑各縣公路、因最近情勢緊張、繼續澈底破壤、日來工作異常繁忙、</p>
<p>免稅洋米　源源進口</p>
<p>四邑米價飛漲、影響民食、日前第一區行政專員古鼎華經召集各縣縣長會議、當經决定救濟各縣糧食辦法、並請中央核准豁免洋米積、現中央巳核准、計第一區所豁各縣、每縣洋米免稅一萬包入口、現新會、開平、台山、恩平各縣商會、已召集米商、討論辦道洋米進口問題、故日來四邑免稅洋米、已源源運入、米價巳漸趨低落云、</p>
<h3>西江米荒解决　桂米弛禁出口　已嚴査漢奸偷運　米價可逐漸低跌</h3>
<p>【肇慶快訊】西江榖米最近因靑黃不接、且×人嗾使漢奸偷運出口及好商乘機操縱、致價格飛漲、中等米每元約糴六斤、下等米亦僅羅六斤半、貧民呌苦連天、社食秩序、亦受影響、第三區行政專員李磊夫、為謀設法救濟、除積極鼓勵增加生產、及嚴査漢奸偷運外、幷呈請省府咨請桂省當局弛禁米石出口、以資調劑、査李主席關心民漢、經予照辦、査桂省當局、亦以粵桂唇齒相依、在抗戰時期、糧食尤應相互調劑供應、特飭令梧州各地、准予開放谷米出口、現西江各縣政府及商團等、巳紛紛派員赴桂採購、以解决此嚴重民食問題、料日間尙有大批昨米上市、米價可逐漸低跌、</p>
<h3>某軍事大員談　我反攻廣州甚有把握　我新配備陸空軍力量足以制×　×欲乘我部署未定動搖我民心</h3>
<p>【韶關快訊】我軍反攻廣州之說、報章傳之已久、記者昨訪某軍事大員、叩以反攻廣州軍事最近部署情形、蒙予詳述如下（一）反攻廣州軍事、自中央軍事當局派員南下後、已在粵北某地舉行緊急軍事會議數次、及在桂林某地開一高級將領會議、不過未能刻即成為事實者、實以各綫之部署需時耳、×方及漢奸竟利用此時機向各方散播謠言、謂廣州我軍已無能克復、冀圖動搖我軍民抗戰信念、旋不知我東西北三線、己結集大軍數十萬、皆配備最新式武器、質與量均能與×相較、且足以制之、（二）我軍事大員、巳奉令親赴前線、担任各路指揮、每一大員、均為智勇兼備之名將、曾與×一戰再戰、一勝再勝者、各師團兵亦經補充與調整、實力比前增加二十餘倍、（三）我陸空軍之奉命參加反攻廣州者、空軍方面、新調到空軍十餘隊、分配於某線等某某機塲、重森炸機亦有十餘特別中隊、陸軍方面、新奉調入粵者、有坦克車五大隊、水陸戰車隊一大隊、最精銳之機械化部隊十餘中隊、（四）我反攻廣州之整個計劃、某軍事長官已奉到最高統帥發下、大約再經一次高級長官會議後、卽可分配各項反攻步驟、故最短期內反攻廣州甚有把握云、</p>

<h3>粵×內鬨益烈　×海陸軍　幾演衝突</h3>
<p>×陸戰隊登陸被阻　×海軍將不予運輸</p>
<p>【澳門快訊】入粵×軍海陸兩部、醞釀內閧、為時已久、初為爭功、嗣則互相牽制、日前×陸軍方面、欲開放珠江河道、謀恢復市區之繁榮、而×海軍方面則堅持不允開放、所有入口之船隻、多方留難恐嚇、務使交通阻梗、因此×陸軍方面、益為深憾、至本月十四日、有×艦一艘、滿載海軍陸戰隊約五百名、停白白鵝潭、即登岸游行、散處各軍用食堂中、喧呼叫囂、向例×軍於夜候、因畏我游擊隊之襲擊、故多匿伏營中、不敢出外、是晚×陸戰隊逾時猶未返艦、×憲兵即派出多人、分別將之閑散、翌日該×艦長官、竟登陸會見×陸軍方面之軍事長官、要求覓地駐紮、廣州×酋、加以拒絕、並不許其登陸、於是×艦之兵、鼓噪異常、陸上×軍恐釀事變、立派出大隊携有輕機關槍多挺、在堤岸一帶佈防、以制止×兵近岸、一時行人斷絕、形勢極為嚴重、其後由×特務隊派人調解、並約定海陸兩方之×軍官、在愛羣酒店會議、結果雙方堅持不下、乃各拍電返國報吿、聽侯解决、當會議時、×海軍方面聲言、在事件未解决前、不負運輸接濟之責、藉以牽制陸上之×軍、其內部之分裂、已日呈尖銳云</p>

<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>影城寡鵠</h3>
<p>好萊塢這個地方、充滿了無數「無淚的寡婦」、「風流寡婦」之名、在她們眞是當之而無愧、她們在唱歌、跳舞或是編織絨線工作之中、送過一天天的光陰、正和她們的那些只顧追隨愛癖遺妻子於不顧的丈夫們一樣、</p>
<p>她們往往在蜜月以後就開始了她們的寡婦生活、這種生活往往要繼續一年至十年之久、也許還不止、時間之長短只靠她們自己來决定、</p>
<p>究竟是那些人呢、這裏幷不單指那些男星的妻子們、其中有許多都是當代的著名女星、像克勞黛考爾白和愛琳鄧、由於丈夫的職業關係、都做了寡婦、蓓蒂黛維絲結婚後立刻變成了「高爾夫寡婦」、每星期日、她獨處無聊的時候、就揮動球棒、往高爾夫場上去一舒筋骨、像這樣的寡婦正是不勝枚舉、</p>
<p>這兒我們先得弄淸楚「寡婦」這一個名詞、好萊塢的寡婦似乎應和印度的焚身殉夫的寡婦（Suttee）歸入一類去印度的習俗上相信、丈夫死後、是往另一個光明快活的世界上去了、所以婦女才有火殉隨往同登樂土的舉動、在這一個動機上、兩者不是極端相似嗎、再翻字典、寡婦這個字、嚴格的解釋起來、應該是「一個為大丈夫死後留下的妻子、」可是、不必苛求、她們的丈夫雖則不曾死、可是不能朝夕相伴、以致她們空閨獨守、稱之為寡婦、實在並不為過、</p>
<p>歌劇明星平克勞斯貝、自晨全暮終日流連在高爾夫球塲上、甚至有時候他的一張新片初映的日子、還是放不下高爾夫球捧來、公司裏要找他、祇要上高爾夫總會去、從沒有找不到的時候、可是苦了他的夫人却不能同往、這是一端、同時他又是一個馬迷、沉迷不返、幸而夫人賢惠、編編絨線、敎養兒女、以度光陰、她是身兼「馬塲寡婦」和另一種「高爾夫寡婦」二職的、</p>
<p>占姆斯賈克奈和狄克鮑惠爾二人有他們獨特的一個癖好、他們稱之為「遊艇旅行」的、可是他們的太太向不同行、這機、當他們欣然就道時、影城中立組添加兩個短明的寡婦、她們留在家裏、看護孩子、管管家事、閑來和愛犬頑頑而已、</p>
<p>李思廉霍華的夫人、寧願做個寡婦也不願和他丈夫一同出門作攝影旅行、她說得好、「我不能跟着他到處亂跑、像他那樣爬上峻峭的山峯去拍攝海鵝之類、我决辦不到、與其跌折了骨頭做一個業餘攝影名家、倒不如安安穩穩的在家當寡婦的好」、同樣的貝錫爾拉斯朋太太、與她亦有同感、這是兩位「開末拉寡婦」、</p>
<p>保羅茂尼有深思之癖、當一个重要角色派任到他時、一二星期之中、他一天總要花掉他二小時至四小時的的工夫、沈思研討還个角色的性格、這時候、他的夫人就被遺在一邊了、保羅對每一个角色都下很深切的研究、像愛彌兒左拉那樣的角色、他讀各種參考書、而夫人就陪伴着他寸步不離、甚至到攝影場去亦是如此、可是當他沉思的時候、他的肉體雖在他妻子身邊、然而他的靈魂早已遠離、不在這個世界上而飛往左拉那个世界上去了、邇個、保羅茂尼夫人却是無法隨往的、</p>
<p>希迪拉瑪也是寡婦、一个軍火寡婦、她說她以前的日子、耳朵裏所聽到的儘是「軍火、軍火」、沒有別的、使她生厭了、道才脫離了那个滿綴珠寳的「狹的籠」、到廣大的社會上來另謀生括、</p>
<p>當羅吉披利奧和他的樂隊往外地演奏時、安蘇紉也是寡婦了、相似的桃樂珊拉蠶的丈夫和樂隊一起作演奏旅行時、桃樂賽在家裏、在攝影埸上、在播音台上、有時候也在棕林俱樂部裏、和她的朋友或她丈夫的朋友、傾聽着路地凡里的音樂、這兩位就可算是好萊塢多數「樂隊寡婦」的代表、</p>
<p>蓓蒂黛維絲也曾有過一個時期是「樂隊寡婦」、可是後來他跟着丈夫周游各地、最後她丈夫脫離了這種生活、她也遠離了這種寡婦生活、然而最近、他倆又快脫離了、</p>
<p>埃洛弗林太太麗蓮達美塔、由於丈夫遨游成性、大部份的日子也是過着獨居生活、而且埃洛弗林不游則已、一游則千里萬里、海闊天空、游與不倦、决不思歸、這次他失踪已三星期多了、希望他是在一個快樂的旅程中、可是對於這樣只顧漫游、不顧妻子的荒唐性格、未免有點不大敢恭維、</p>
<p>琪恩赫旭脫是一個書迷、新版書一出、無有不涉獵一過者、同時他又喜歡研究聖經、這個使他的夫人成了個「書卷寡婦」、</p>
<p>「政治寡婦」可就多了、茂文陶格拉斯夫人、羅拔蒙高茂萊夫人、愛德華亞諾夫人和愛德華羅賓遜夫人都屬此點、</p>
<p>聰明的帕脫奧勃林夫人挽救了部份的寡婦生涯、帕脫奧勃林也是喜歡看賽馬的、往往和同志萊爾夫白賴梅RalphBellamy　占姆斯賈克奈以及法蘭克麥克休【Frank　McHu　h】流連忘返、為了補救這點、她搬了家搬在台爾馬（Delmar）正和跑馬塲相接、這樣、他到跑馬塲上去時、她也可以參加了或者即使她不去、相距那樣近、說句笑話甚至祗要她搖搖鈴、帕脫便可以聽見、知道該是囘來吃晚飯的時候了、</p>
<p>茂娜洛埃是个「製片家從寡鏽」、意絲蘭納是「細劇家寡婦」、她們的寡婦生活、是在丈夫們專心工作不暇「她」顧的時候、</p>
<p>女明星嫁給影業以外的人的、如克勞黛考爾白和愛琳鄧、文夫都是醫生、克勞黛的丈夫和她一同出外赴宴時、一到十點敲過、立刻形踪不見、像一個鬼似的、他有很好的理由作為藉口、什麽「醫院裏一定要我去」哪、「有點工作要做』哪、而克勞黛的寡婦生活、完全是繫社會人士的健康情形之上的、愛琳鄧的丈夫一個牙科專家、更遠處紐約、他是個盡職服務的人、結果祇好讓她多度兩天鴛衾獨擁的生活了、他們夫婦之間常有三千里的間隔、因此造成了愛琳鄧「長距離寡婦」之名而蜜達蓮嘉珞兒、也是此中之一、</p>
<p>弗萊亞斯坦常勤於練舞、不顧他的夫人、史賓塞屈萊賽、魯易司東、和羅拔蒙高茂萊則常留攝影塲中、他們都是商人式的明星、把攝影埸當成辦公室似的、鎮日在那邊、就是商人的妻子一年中也有一二次往丈夫的辦公室走走的、可是這三位夫人却從不如此、在丈夫工作之際、她們從不走近攝影場去、祇是留在家裏讀讀報紙雜誌上的影界新聞、</p>
<p>同時羅拔蒙高茂萊、吏賓塞屈萊賽、愛好馬球、考爾門和李却白塞爾默斯愛網球唐阿米契愛播香狄克福倫愛頑撲克、羅克和却斯脫馬立斯愛魔術、都是造成妻子做寡婦的原因、</p>
<p>記得愛茄倍根咽、他雖則尙未結婚、但我們敢斷言、他未來的妻子一定也將是个寡婦、至少、她能坐在他膝上的機會要比却利麥卡雖賽——那个小木頭人——少得多、</p>
<p>可是假如克拉克蓋勃爾和卡洛朗白結婚——這件事的可能性現在更大了——未洛却永不會做寡婦、他們的興趣完全相同、克拉克也决不會不帶卡洛獨自一人出去打野鴨的、</p>

<h3>赴澳作埠際足球賽之意中代表　總會內定十六人　取銷完全選拔少壯派的前議</h3>

<h3>德國體育機關之組織</h3>
<p>今日德國當局、尤其是元首兼國務總理希特拉、為發展社曾衛生及敎育起見、對於體育一道甚為注重、蓋欲鍛鍊國民體魄、必先由家國方面整頓一切為前提、試觀一九三六年在柏林所開之歌林比克運動會、其當事人員眼光之遠大、辦事之切實、組織之精幹、可以知之、彼等從一九三三年開始施行發展德國體育工作、其成績亦與歌林比克運動會無殊、迄今六年來工作之成效、不獨能使今日德國體育事業、較前增進、且對於體育之建設、更有深意及系統焉、</p>

<h3>赴菲報聘之港埠際隊　四月二日戰星華　借此機會以資練習</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】定期四月十八日動程赴菲報聘之香港埠際足球代表隊、早經總會選定十五人、除懇印、烈厘、及後來補選之帕架、均聲稱因事不能前往外、其餘各日、巳函覆聽會、皆稱可以成行、又總會擬於港專際隊未出發前、舉行一二場練習賽、以使各個代表、得明瞭台作工夫、惟値茲球事緊張之秋、難得空閒時日而舉行、故决定俟至洲中華隊來港時之第二塲比賽（四月二日）、用此埠際隊以港聯隊之名義、出與星華隊週旋、此誠一舉兩得者也、</p>
<h3>早操效能（二）</h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>（三）有嬌正身心的効能</p>
<p>身心分界的墻垣、自十九世紀以來、逐步的推翻、一元論也跟着抬頭、致對于體育的實施也有一個很大的轉變、前人視體育祇屬于身體的訓練的觀念、亦不攻而自破、早操、是體育訓練的一種、它當然能够包括有身心的訓練、獲矯正的功效、且普通人的毛病、在睡眠的時候、必發出了很多玄想、是無益的、有危害身心可能的、在不能入眠或睡醒時為甚、這種的幻想、都會令到你不願意起牀、而繼續去胡思亂想的、若天天是這樣的下去、對于心身兩方面的危機、必定是逐步的增進、到底你一生的事業、也要給牠把握住、必爾由你自主、所以、我們要挽救道種危機、必需養成了早操的習慣、因為淸晨的空氣、都是一盤很淸潔的聖水、能够把你污濁的頭腦洗滌、故你每天經過早操之後、必得到血脈流通、頭腦淸醒等利益、</p>
<p>（四）能幫助消化增加食慾</p>
<p>我們首先要認識的、就是食慾和消化的關係、日常大家也感覺得到腹飢（消化力强）時、食量特殊的增加、腹滿（消化力弱）時、總覺不想吃東西、由此、我們可以得到一個定理——旺盛的食慾、和消化力的强弱成正比例、卽消化力强時、食慾旺盛、消化力弱時、食慾自然滅低、根據這個定義、我們想食慾旺盛、必需消化作用高上、能使到消化作用高上的方法很多、在我的見解、以調體育日方法、是最根本、最有效的方法、尢其以淸晨運動為最重要、</p>
<p>「早操」雖是和緩的運動、但七節做完之後、其蓮動量已經得到飽和、對于力的消耗、亦不算少了、人的身體、像一副機器一樣、有了然量、才產生「能力一、有能力才能够動、我們在腹飢的時候、總覺得全身軟弱一點、氣力也不能提得出來、這就因為體內缺乏了燃料不能發生熱量、致沒有力的作用的原故、當我們運動的時候必須大量的熱、消失于身體的各部份、把熱量消耗之後、又需有燃料的補充才能够繼續的運動、人體對于飲食的物質、就是燃料、在消耗熱量愈多時、須要食物（燃料）的供給的份量也愈大、（食料的增加）、使當腰腹運動的時候、直接的幫助胃膜的轉動、胃液的流動、而使胃的消化作用更加高上、所以早操實可以幫助消化、而致于食懲旺盛、</p>
<p>（五）助長發育的效能</p>
<p>一般人的見解、謂個人的體格、强大與否、必以其遺傳體之健康、强壯的程度為正比例、這個觀點、雖不至錯誤、不過未免太過于偏見一些、「有其父必有其子」的觀念、不必太重視、事實上除了遺傳體的關係之外、還有最重要的是後天的訓練、所以健全的體格是必有優越的先天的遺傳、更要有良好環境的訓練、先天的遺傳雖不好、若沒有後天的培養是不行的、但先天不足的人（有部份欠缺的例外）可以用後天的培養、訓練、也能達到健全發育的希望、「早操」是最有保險性的運動、當發育時間的青年、有恆于這種運動、可以得到平均（完全）的發育、必不致畸形局部、所以（早操）實對、于發育期間的靑年的發育問題、極有關係、（未完）</p>

<h3>白芒花</h3>
<p>— 羽人</p>
<p>新樣的山野間彌漫着朦朧的霧氣，把一切塗上濃厚的憂鬱的顏色。</p>
<p>我們一共九個，靜寂的朝着泥路前進，工作驅使着我們，更鼓勵着我們徒步走到遠還的雲烟以外的地方。我們帶着被雨打濕的身軀，默默地眺望着那遙遙的零落的村莊，焦急的眼光不斷在長長的的旅途裏，覓找着這次出發的遼遠的目的地。</p>
<p>眼前漸漸地顯明的浮現了一堆白色的屋宇，慢慢地近了，近了，依照路程距離的惴測，我們知道，這是一個有着漂亮的名宇的墟市，——白芒花！</p>
<p>走進了壚內，映入我們眼簾的是一堆堆滿地零亂的瓦礫，一座座破碎焦黑的屋角。那一種十室九空的現象，無遺地表現出這是一個曾經兵燹的劫埸！</p>
<p>寂寞，寂寞！只有幾個鄉民在路旁擺下販賣餅食的攤子，只有幾條黃狗在街上流連躊躇，只有兩大的交響樂在哀奏着這個墟市的慘淡的遭遇！</p>
<p>我們從市西直貫到市東，好像一隊探奇者步入了一座荒凉的古城！</p>
<p>當我們行到了墟郊，禁不住的就在那些被×人焚劫過的殘蹟上徘徊。犬概是因為沒有人任劫後發掘淸理，所以地面上依然播送着一陣陣腐爛的屍骸的裏味，假如沒有記起這是一個刦後的壚市，亦許會令人意識到是一片靜寂的荒塜吧！</p>
<p>在瓦礫上，遠遠地，一條黃狗正在咬嚼着「團白色的東西，好奇心驅使着我逼近去看，呵！那原來是一個人的顱骨，一個帶肉的黃白色的顱骨，我看到了那窟窿狀的眼，窟窿狀的鼻，窟竅狀的口！雖然沒有肉面的表情，但是，我却靈敏的感到了在那固定的猙獰的骷髏上所隱藏着的無限悲憤哀痛的情緒。我輕輕地用手把它拿來詳細觀察，未曾消蝕盡凈的腐爛的肉塊還發出了强烈薰人的奇臭！</p>
<p>鄉民吿訴我：那個骷髏的原身是很難到白芒花來的流浪人之羣中的一個，在去年冬季戰事爆發時犧牲在敵人的殘暴屠殺下。時間的久延把死難者的肉身都綹蛀蝕了。現在只留下這瓦礫上的一個破顧，幾片殘骨！</p>
<p>多麽令人迷惘的故事呵！多麽令人傷痛迴味的廢墟上的懷跡，當我閉起眼睛，用想像構成了那種在敵人鉄蹄蹂躪下的狀况時，一陣恐怖與仇恨的氣氛便緊緊地纏繞在我的胸中！</p>
<p>鄉民說，在這裏骷髏是常見的，因為大部分地方都不曾整潔描除，所以整個白芒花經常都在屍臭的籠罩中，一方面更因為墟上的居民都逃走一空，壚上的景象就倍加蕭條了１</p>
<p>雨稍為小了，我們停了片刻，便再繼續向東行進。</p>
<p>呵！白芒花！屍臭裏的白芒花，寂寞裏的白芒花，遍處都是敗瓦斷垣的白芒花呵！你的遭難後的殘景永遠的烙刻在我們的心中，我們永遠的不忘記你，東江的千百萬的同胞們也將永遠為你留下個血的銘誌！府們希望有一天：在光榮的鬭爭中，鐵，血，和肉所造成的三合土會把你從頭冉造！儘讓鬼子們把你當少婦一樣殘暴的淫弄踐蹋吧！儘讓敵人把你像玩兒意一般破壞盡凈吧！今天，千百萬顆心臟己為你的遭遇而震動疾跳，千百萬枝戈矛巳為你的恥辱而猛烈煆煉，千百萬的人羣己為你的復興而振　膊搏闕！</p>
<p>白芒花！讓你的新生奠基在積極的國爭中吧！</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>對方的誠意的默認，便是最肯定的回答，不容她有所疑惑和辯解，於是她，往日對於義勇軍印象和幻想的好感，成了不可追及的往夜之夢，夢中所遺下的感覺，祇有悔意，因為人是不甘心被侵犯的——當個人的直覺的時候，尤其是她過於重視自尊心的人，她認為自尊心就是自己的貞操；雖然，她是弱者，容忍着强逼，威脅。</p>
<p>他催促她走的時候，選寫：</p>
<p>「等一下。」</p>
<p>她望着自已最愛的花瓶，瓶中的菊花時常在手里的琴譜，別了，這彷彿已是最後一望，</p>
<p>突然，門外響了敵門的聲音，他被刺激得幾乎喊出來：</p>
<p>「你想陷害我嗎？你這個女妖！」</p>
<p>他立刻决定了——用槍打死門外人，不得己的時候，還有自已，留下她，給另一位同志留下必要的工作，當他知迫是女僕來送茶後，他給她取出手帕來；用槍維持着命令的神聖，迫她向門外說：</p>
<p>「我不要茶」。</p>
<p>「客人呢」？</p>
<p>「客——人」？他望着他擺搖的頭，又說：「客……人……走了……」</p>
<p>「小姐，你的聲音怎麽發抖呢？病了嗎？讓我進去看着吧」！</p>
<p>他想：</p>
<p>「糟了」！</p>
<p>這時勝，他有一種超人的智慧，使自己的手閉了電登，並且，他用手槍給她一種示意——他的恐怖。同時，他又起了一個念頭：</p>
<p>「如果她勇敢些，我的手槍又有什麽用處呢？</p>
<p>他又想趁這個機會跑開，不也是隨便她馮？」</p>
<p>但是，她顫抖極了，如果不被他握住衣襟，也許立刻傾倒下去。</p>
<p>門邊裂開一條縫，過道上有一縷燈光夾着一個不完整的頭影，倒落在黑暗中的地板上，女僕的聲昔；</p>
<p>「小姐，睡了嗎？」</p>
<p>「還……沒有……」</p>
<p>你一定是病啦，你的聲音鄱變啦！」</p>
<p>「沒有——」</p>
<p>「那你是去過嗎。」</p>
<p>「什麼你都知道——」</p>
<p>（十四）</p>
<h3>論投降八股</h3>
<p>— 景春風</p>
<p>在宇宙風上海刊創刊號上，有一篇巴金的文字，題目是「公式主義者」，內容是指那些只寫公文式抗戰文章和只喊「最後勝利必屬於我」口號的一些不去力行抗戰的人們，這樣的文章雖然沒有明白斥實議和的漢奸，但是身為好字輩的人們，似乎也該掩卷而過罷，那知實則不然，本港的某報居然拿了該文做了一篇洋洋灑灑的「論抗戰八股」不止帮閒斥做「抗戰八股」的人，甚而至根本來一個翻案，連抗戰都反對了，他們的結論却是一個投降求和，現在可以引來一段：</p>
<p>「對於上述這篇文章，我們是大半同意的，所値得斟酌的是「最後勝利是大衆的……」其實如果還是打下去，這幸福是誰也沒有法子保證的——現在打下去是决不能得着大衆的擁護了。我們要勝利，只有從和平奮鬥中去爭取，我們有了和平，則一切抗戰八股那樣空虛——自然都消滅，總之那只有一條路。祇有一條向和平邁進的路」。</p>
<p>道篇文章內容的荒謬到極點自不待言，不過正當他們斥「抗戰八股」的時候，他們自己却也落到八股公式一類的陷阱，顯了原形，做起投降的八股來。</p>
<p>如果按巴金分析抗戰八股的公式來分一下，我們可得以下的答案：</p>
<p>第一段，按着人無不死之理，而推出一套「世無不和的戰爭」，說明戰勝是和，戰敗也得和，旣是無論戰勝或戰敗都得和，向不從今日就和，這一段是為中國必須求和的下文先立一個註脚。第二段說明抗戰十數月，中觀已經失敗了，又失據了人民的擁護，大槪汚萬游擊隊的言詞，在這段要出現的。第三段縱隊國際時勢，證明中國冉抗下去必敗，同時提出近衛聲明和汪精衛賣國建議宣言，表示救中國只有此路可行。描寫汪某的熱心謀國，態度的光明偉大等吹拍字眼，要在這一段大賣力氣的。第四段是罵蘇聯，斥中國的共產黨，表示忠心謀國舍我其誰，同時哀嘆國民有眼不識荊山玉。再呢惡意威脅國民說：日本待我旣如斯之寬大，我我豈能不向之求和乎，假使錯過此萬戰難逢的機會，就該「戰離和亦不易了。」第五段是最後勝利必屬于日本。</p>
<p>這一套八設，無以名之，只好稱之寫投降八股。如果和「抗戰八股」比起來，却有極顯著的差別，無論如何，抗戰八股還是中國人的作品，而投降八股却是日本貨了。再呢，「抗戰八股」的作者還有抗戰必勝的信念，而主張抗下去，只是「投降八股」的作者，根本不主張抗下去，更不信必勝，而甘脆跪下去喊降。一個是奴才，一個是死裏奮鬥求生，二者之間那個要得要不得，就不待知者而後知了。</p>
<p>萬幸的還是做「抗戰八股一的人多，假使一切做「抗戰八股」的人，都改頭換心去做「投降八股」，中國的前途可就令人担心了。聽一句日本人的話去投降，還萬不如聽一句中國人的「抗戰八股」的一句「最後勝利必屬我」的話。讀者以為何如？</p>

<p>這好像一定是佛山無綫電器發生障礙了，從昨天起情勢來得很壞。今犬早上聽無綫電的一阿部」修理了。因為還沒有恢復原狀，電話或是乾電池想就送來了吧。雖然是這樣，可是從才田大尉那裏是可以想像到一些；然而，無論如何打聽了軍報道部，管原少尉早已拿起了電話頻頻的說着。我要暫他待着他把話說完了，我聽着說：「下午一時嗎？更加進了？」「右邊嗎？是右邊吧—嘆—從右邊的敵人？受到猛射嗎？」這樣說着，這一定是有發表戰况的資料了。一看管原少尉的憎恨的瞼孔，右邊的差役却把指郎塞進耳朵，並不取備忘錄，話好像是相當長，我想往後一定是很多困難的，於是我就從傍邊拿了一張紙，把管原少尉重述的片言，開始寫備忘錄了，這麽一來，管原少尉看我一眼，立刻就好像躊躇似的聲說了：「是花房君被擊斃了嗎」這樣說着就把聽筒傳給我。「花房？」我就突如渝烏雲遮蔽了睛天似的，馬上把電話聽筒按到耳邊去。可是，話却一點也聽不到了：「喂！喂！這樣着急的打聽，對方却沒有一點聲息，管原少尉指着聽筒說：「不行，不行！你把Suft拿起來，把Suft拿起來，「我慌忙的握着突起的金具，立刻就聽到才田大尉的聲音了……怎麽的，有什麽事情要做完了的呢？啊！現在高雄君跟你說吧！」，聽到了高雄君的聲音之後，我就着急的說：「是花房君被擊斃了嗎？…」，「無…無論如何……，已經絕望了，苦惱，…是苦惱的事情…」他的聲昔時常好像悲哀似的，無論如何繼續聽到了的樣子，頭腦混亂不能順序地說話的他，翻翻覆覆好容易把事實判明了，花朵戰死了，是毫無置疑，我就不放心似的囘到吾人聚集的地方去，也許說不出什麽話吧！晚上在燈下，中村和知久都來了，戶來不把發表的資料說出來。走進來時，還是除了我說「花房被擊弊了」之外，便沒有其他人願意說，一會兒，大家就懸着像窒息了似的臉孔。戶來走到這邊，「唔！」的說了一聲就瞠目一想，突然躺在椅子上把兩手交好起來了，跟花房一道乘船去的戶來的臉顏是變成蒼白了，連絡員們也像石像，似的挺立着，我就把縱的橫的寫了混亂難讀的備忘錄，在機子上打開來向大家說了。我不斷的說活大家是不斷的沉默着，後來大家才嘆息的說：一無論如何，是必要向本社報知的……」，我看了手鏢，己經是八點十五分了。九時才有台北的無綫電的連絡，大概是就把這消打發的吧。本社的報吿簡單的記事是要送出去的！　　我拿起鉛筆開始寫原稿了。（未完）</p>
<h3>我的記憶</h3>

<p>紅杜鵑，艷麗的花巴，像火；像曾經一瞥的兩頰；而，更像曾經一瞥的口屑呀。</p>
<p>杜鵑鳥，它把身子隱藏在灌木叢中；但，聽，那是痛苦的聲昔，它叫出了春天的哀怨！</p>
<p>春天有牧女們熱情的歌，那，如像連綿的山峯，有着高低抑揚的醉人的昔律，不動心嗎？</p>
<p>一顆靑春的心在靑春的氣氛裏。</p>
<p>春天，小鳥們都在樹上造了窩，</p>
<p>春天，和煦的陽光在身上，而也有和煦的混風在身上，這溫柔，怎不使你肢體癱軟呢？</p>
<p>春天給我的是一串串的柔情。</p>
<p>春天給我的是一個美麗的記憶。</p>
<p>如今，春天又到來，我想像春天的路，她，竟有異樣的情調了。</p>
<p>紅杜鴟，像血！鵑聲，依然是哀怨的，但却有另外一種痛苦的接觸。</p>
<p>歌，常從牧女口中唱出而常戞然中止，以後是一些慘然的追憶，追憶一個命運的轉化，在靑天裏。</p>
<p>依然有樹上的鳥叫；陽光，風，也不依然存在嗎？但，它使你煩躁，它使你灼熱，它使你的血液流轉得更快了。</p>
<p>因為這是一個烽火中的春天啊！</p>

<h3>Lessons from the Fall of Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Czechoslovakia can be said to be completely subjugated. On the 19th, German troops, led by General Gablenz, paraded through the city of Bohemia for two hours. The parade included infantry, artillery, tank convoys, and aircraft formations, displaying their might and flaunting their power. The German troops, acting as conquerors, forced key members of the Czech government to sit alongside German military and political authorities to observe the parade, while the Czech people mostly avoided it by going for walks in the countryside or staying away from windows, unwilling to witness the German military's procession. The emotions of animosity and the inner sorrow felt by the Czechs are imaginable. This historical fact contains a rich and profound lesson, which we Chinese compatriots cannot afford to ignore.</p>
<p>The grief over Czechoslovakia's fall is felt more keenly by the people than by the government authorities, yet the responsibility for it rests with the government authorities to a much greater extent, a hundredfold, than with the people. Today, key members of the Czech government still sit alongside German military and political authorities to observe the conquerors' parade, while the Czech people not only cannot bear to see the German military's show of force but even refuse to celebrate with waving flags. We can still clearly recall how, in September of last year, when German troops invaded Czechoslovakia, the Czech people were so generous and determined, willing to drive the German troops out of Czech territory under the leadership of their government. However, the result was that President Beneš's enthusiasm was completely buried, and the arguments of compromisers, such as General Syrový, with his one eye, completely triumphed. This victory left Czechoslovakia with the root cause of its complete subjugation today. How can the Czech people not feel heartbroken!</p>
<p>At the time, some commentators argued that Czechoslovakia could prolong its existence by not resisting, but resistance would lead to an earlier demise. However, looking at the current reality, what price has Czechoslovakia paid for prolonging its existence for this half year? Moreover, resistance would not necessarily lead to subjugation, and even if it ultimately did, the time would certainly be longer than this half year, and the Czech people would not have to endure this unspeakable sorrow in their hearts. The ancient Chinese saying, "Better to be a shattered jade than an unbroken tile," is a reflection of the regret felt by the Czech people today.</p>
<p>Secondly, the responsibility for the rise of German aggression should be entirely borne by the British and French governments. The authorities in Britain and France certainly recognized that the only way to avoid war at the time was to force Czechoslovakia to endure humiliation and cede territory. They also dreamed that by being generous with others' possessions and obtaining Hitler's promise, they could solve the problem once and for all. Little did they know that with the conclusion of the "Munich Agreement," Britain and France were completely fooled by Germany. Not only has today's reality proven that Hitler's "aggression" ambitions are limitless, but even judging by the situation at the time, if Britain and France had upheld their credibility and taken a firm stance against Germany, then the "Nazi" Germany, with its unfledged wings and many internal problems, might not have dared to risk going all the way. The military strategists' principle of "avoiding the strong and attacking the weak" was already deeply understood by Hitler. Germany does not dare to advance westward now but is prioritizing the completion of its eastward plan, which is based on this principle. However, if the German military succeeds in its eastward advance, and its national strength gradually increases and its material supplies become sufficient, then it will inevitably turn its spear westward to pursue its "Third Reich" dream of the past seven or eight years, which is within expectations. The authorities in Britain and France may still imagine that after Germany annexes the small countries of Eastern Europe, its target will be the Soviet Union, so Britain and France can permanently remain on the sidelines, or even fantasize about an opportunity to profit from the situation. But according to our observations, Hitler will absolutely not be so foolish as to collide head-on with a stone wall. He will still avoid the strong and attack the weak, and continue to covet countries that desire peace without paying a price.</p>
<p>Now, the "Nazi" crusaders will certainly continue their eastward advance. According to a report from the Romanian ambassador to British Foreign Secretary Halifax, 44 German divisions are preparing to move east, half of which have already been concentrated in Czechoslovakia, and the other half are being mobilized in Germany. Furthermore, according to a report from the Romanian authorities, German troops have already entered the Subcarpathian Ruthenia province from Slovakia, appearing to be preparing to attack Romania. At the same time, Hitler's mouthpiece, Goering, is ranting: "Germany has such heroic soldiers—referring to Hitler—and must have a heroic nation as their backing." According to this reasoning, if the "heroic soldiers" annex Eastern Europe, the "heroic nation" will inevitably conquer the world. When Goering greatly praises "our leader" as being so great and so glorious, and emphatically states, "Only great things are enough to repay our leader," the Czech people will certainly feel even more sorrow, and the countries of Eastern Europe will certainly tremble with fear. We can only wonder what the British and French authorities think of Germany's arrogance!</p>
<p>If the small countries of Eastern Europe do not want to repeat the disastrous fate of Czechoslovakia, they must prepare early and make active resistance with all their strength. All invaded nations, if they want to survive, must resist to the end. If Britain and France want to prevent the advance of the aggressors and create a backlash, they must advise the aggressors with full armament as soon as possible. Advising the aggressors does not necessarily lead to war. "Armed peace" can still be applied to aggressors whose wings are not yet fully formed. Britain and France can no longer entertain the illusion that Germany will advance further east and invade the Soviet Union, because the advance of the "Nazi crusaders" has very strict boundaries. It is heard that the British Cabinet has decided to strengthen contact with all peaceful countries to cope with this new European situation, and some in the British government are even advocating a conference between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. This is welcome news, and it is hoped that it will become more concrete.</p>
<h3>How the Soviet Red Army Cooperates with the People</h3>
<p>— By Soviet Cavalry Marshal Budyonny, translated by Mei Zhen from "Moscow News"</p>
<p>Comrade Stalin, at the celebration conference of the Moscow Soviet, addressed the brave Red Army of the Soviet Union, saying:</p>
<p>"Regarding the loving and intimate relationship between the army and the people, there is no place in the world that can compare with our Soviet Union. In our country, the army is loved, respected, and universally cared for by the people. Why is this possible? Because the workers and peasants have created their own army, which serves not the masters, but the former slaves, the now liberated workers and peasants. This is the first time in the world."</p>
<p>The Red Army, the great protective screen and defenders of the victory of the socialist revolution, is connected by blood ties with all the people of our socialist motherland. The unity of the Soviet people and the fact that the Red Army is equipped with all modern combat tools are a serious warning to the fascist aggressors—even the bourgeois newspapers cannot but acknowledge this fact. This unity, this close relationship between the Soviet people and their army, is no secret to the instigators of a new world war. They also know this fact, and all the working people of the capitalist world also show the greatest sympathy and concern for the victorious socialist motherland and the army of the October Revolution.</p>
<p>The Constant Task of the Soviet Red Army</p>
<p>The fact that the Soviet Union is constantly surrounded by capitalist countries makes the Soviet people keenly aware that it is essential to constantly bear the task of defense, and to constantly pay attention to the enhancement of the Soviet Union's defense forces. Therefore, it is very important for the Soviet people to further improve the combat effectiveness of the Red Army, and to strengthen the Red Army both organizationally and technically.</p>
<p>The completion of the first and second Stalin Five-Year Plans has transformed the Soviet Union into the most powerful industrial country. The development of new industries in cities, as in the countryside, has become a major foundation for the Soviet Union's national defense.</p>
<p>During the first Five-Year Plan, the Red Army's technical equipment was completely transformed. Due to its organized military structure and its military training, it has become a first-class army. Even the enemy has to admit its strength and power, and the high standard of its weapons.</p>
<p>The Red Army's advanced technical equipment makes it the strongest and most powerful army in the world. Socialist industry is supplying the Red Army with automatic weapons, all kinds of machine guns and heavy artillery.</p>
<p>During the civil war, the Red Army was equipped only with captured spoils of war, such as tanks. But today, the Red Army has all kinds of tens of thousands of tanks. All these tanks are manufactured in Soviet factories, using Soviet materials.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's aviation and its successes have occupied many records in the world. Thousands of the latest-style airplanes, various designs of airplanes—super-speed bombers, fast-flying fighter planes, reconnaissance and attack planes, and other similar airplanes—manufactured by Soviet engineers and workers, have greatly enhanced the combat effectiveness of the Red Army.</p>
<p>The Leadership of the Communist Party</p>
<p>The Red Army is led by the Bolshevik Party, which is its most fundamental advantage. It was this party leadership that guaranteed the decisive victory in the civil war. At that time, 300,000 members of the Communist Party, or 65 percent of its total membership, were fighting on various fronts. At that time, Lenin, the great leader of the proletarian revolution, stood at the forefront of national defense. Lenin and Stalin formulated and implemented plans for all major battles of the Red Army. Several battles that determined the fate of the Soviet Republic, such as the battles at Tsaritsyn, Bialystok, and Petrograd, and the various battles that defeated Denikin and Wrangel, were all planned by Comrade Stalin and carried out under his leadership. The Red Army was victorious in the civil war because the Communist Party, in its arduous struggle against the enemy, succeeded in developing an outstanding Bolshevik proletarian command cadre.</p>
<p>The former mechanic, a long-standing member of the Bolshevik Party, Voroshilov, is a military man with such genius. During the civil war, he commanded a small detachment organized by the workers of Lugansk. But today, he is the first marshal of the Soviet Union. A group of great military men—Frunze, Chapayev, Shchors, Kotovsky, Gais, and others—are equally famous.</p>
<p>The Red Army has become an invincible force because it has such excellent political leaders as Lenin, Stalin, Molotov, Kalinin, Frunze, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Kirov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Shchadenko, and Mekhlis, all of whom have participated in the political training of the Red Army.</p>
<p>The Heroic Representation of the Party</p>
<p>The heroic cause of the party representatives in the army in organizing political activities in the army, and their self-sacrifice, naturally played a particularly significant role in the victory of the Red Army. These party representatives sent to the army by the Bolshevik Party brought with them the spirit of the party, the discipline and heroism of the party in the revolutionary struggle of the ×× class.</p>
<p>After the civil war, all the technical equipment and training of the Red Army were raised to a very high level. It is of course impossible to compare the equipment and training of the Red Army of that era with the current situation. Voroshilov once said:</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that if all this technology can be expanded by our excellent cadres in the Red Army, by our Bolshevik party members, workers, peasants, detectives, by our excellent soldiers, by our glorious infantry, cavalry, artillery, tank soldiers, engineers, aviators, sailors, by the entire strength and Bolshevik persistence of the workers, collective farm peasants of this great country willing to build a socialist country—the result will become a force that no interventionist can resist."</p>
<p>World × imperialism has attempted to test the strength of the Soviet Union by force more than once. The Soviet people will never forget the invasion of the Soviet border region in 1929 caused by the provocation of the Japanese army, such as the attempts at Changkufeng. These attempts have been stopped by the deadly blows given by the Red Army units.</p>
<p>Based on their own experience, Japanese × imperialism has had the opportunity to understand that in terms of the performance and quantity of its military power, and the military preparedness of its army, the Red Army has become a first-class army.</p>
<p>In 1929, the mechanized equipment averaged 2.6 horsepower per person in the ranks of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, while in 1933 the number rose to 7.7 horsepower, and in the last five years there has been an amazing increase. Our current rifle divisions, in terms of their organization, technical equipment, and combat effectiveness, have been listed among the most advanced of these units.</p>
<p>The Red Army's strength lies not only in its organization and equipment, but most importantly in its personnel. Our Red Army's cadres are first of all Bolshevik cadres who selflessly respect the motherland and the Party and possess extraordinary military capabilities. The commanders of the military regions, armies, divisions, brigades and regiments are almost entirely members of the Bolshevik Party, and 75 percent of the lieutenants, captains and majors are members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. The Red Army's personnel are brave and progressive people who contribute all their abilities and knowledge to the strength and progress of the motherland.</p>
<p>Among them, there are countless outstanding aviators, brave submariners, outstanding tankers and cavalrymen. In the last five years, approximately 4,000 commanders, political workers, engineers, technicians, and Red Army soldiers have received government medals.</p>
<p>The courage of Russian soldiers has long been famous. History has recorded many examples proving this noble quality of Russian military power. The heroic struggles of the Russian army under the leadership of one of the world's greatest military men, Suvorov, are well-known evidence.</p>
<p>When the Russian army won a series of important victories over the long-enjoyed invincible Prussian king, they gained fame during the Seven Years' War. In melee combat, the bravery of Russian soldiers, their endurance, and their love for their motherland, these qualities have long been famous throughout the world.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Glorious Tradition</p>
<p>The Red Army personnel, whose predecessors shed blood for freedom, peace, and the happiness of the Soviet people, possess outstanding military capabilities. The Red Army personnel will never lose the achievements gained by their predecessors.</p>
<p>The unity between the Soviet people and the Red Army, and the unbreakable blood ties, are the true guarantee of the country's defense forces. If the fascist aggressors dare to venture forth, then they will be waging a war not only against the Red Army, but also against all 170 million or more of the Soviet people.</p>
<p>The recent events in our country have most powerfully demonstrated this in all aspects. Let us talk about the events of Lake Khasan, about the call to join the Red Army, and finally about the strategic exercises of the Red Army units in order—everywhere, in all encounters, one can encounter a very vivid picture of the unity of the Soviet people and their Red Army.</p>
<p>During those tense days when the situation was brewing, the attention of the entire country was focused on Lake Khasan. It can be said that from July 29 to August 11, during these memorable days, every citizen of the country had considered himself mobilized, as a soldier in the ranks of the Red Army. And during these days, the Red Army personnel bravely fought for their socialist motherland in the Lake Khasan area, elevating themselves to the highest point of self-sacrificing heroism unprecedented in a country in the cause of defending the socialist country. The Soviet newspapers told us how many requests were sent out by the brothers and compatriots of the soldiers fighting at Lake Khasan, requesting that they be sent into the ranks of the Red Army to replace their brothers.</p>
<p>The Days of Formal Conscription</p>
<p>The young citizens of the Soviet Union consider the day they are drafted into the Red Army to be one of the happiest days of their lives. They think that they are striving to be worthy of the noble profession of a soldier of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and to open fire on the enemy. The day of formal conscription is not only a time for those being conscripted to serve, but also a time for celebration for their families.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, tens of thousands of young people, having long dreamed of entering the army for which they have been preparing for no less than a day for this noble honor, and joining the Red Army, become Voroshilov marksmen, cavalry soldiers, airborne paratroopers, and aviators.</p>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of young people are awarded with the Labor Defense Medal in preparation, and countless marksmen, aviators, and tank soldiers are being trained annually at the Stalin Automobile Factory alone.</p>
<p>All of this contributes a perfect explanation to these articles recorded in the Stalin Constitution:</p>
<p>"Military service in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is an honorable duty of Soviet citizens."</p>
<p>The People Welcome Red Soldiers</p>
<p>The strategic exercises of the Red Army are a true people's festival everywhere. During the exercises, the local people share some of the responsibilities of the soldiers, and the collective farm peasants become guides to help find roads, find wells, and other things.</p>
<p>The close unity between the Red Army and the people is guaranteed by Article 138 of the Stalin Constitution. Constitution 138 stipulates: "Citizens serving in the Red Army, on equal terms with other companies, have the right to vote and the right to be elected." When the people of the various Soviet republics elected countless military personnel as representatives to the Supreme Soviet, they declared their love and trust for the Red Army.</p>
<p>Enjoying the unlimited support of the people, under the leadership of the beloved Soviet Marshal Voroshilov, the Red Army has become an invincible army in the world. Events such as the Battle of Lake Khasan have shown more than once that there is no force in the world that can resist the military power of the Red Army, which is supported by the entire Soviet people.</p>
<p>No fascist theories about "storm troops" and "shock troops" can be verified or realized in Soviet territory. The enemy will suffer cruel blows, no matter what theories or weapons he may apply.</p>
<p>The transformation of the army from a force of oppression and conquest into a defender of the interests of the workers and peasants, a defender who is close to the people and loved by the people, is still a first in human history. Such an army, the armed force of this socialist country, is able to defend his motherland at any time and in any international situation, and the mission he bears—the mission of socialist construction, the mission of the Soviet people led by the world's greatest soldier Stalin.</p>
<h3>From Chongqing to Chengdu</h3>
<p>On March 2nd at 10:00 AM, I departed from Chongqing by military vehicle, and arrived in Chengdu at 4:00 PM on the 3rd, covering a total distance of 530 kilometers. The entire route was mountainous. The area near Chongqing was dominated by towering mountains and sheer cliffs. After leaving Chongqing's borders, the landscape transformed into a continuous series of hills. About 30 kilometers from Chengdu, there was another large mountain range, with roads as narrow as sheep intestines. Cars ascended and descended, constantly navigating through precipices and cliffs. If one was even slightly careless, the car could overturn. Only when it got dark were we able to get over this high mountain, then the view suddenly opened up to an endless plain. Chengdu is situated in the center of this plain. Furthermore, after crossing this mountain, the wind suddenly picked up and turned piercingly cold. It is said that this strong wind was blowing from the direction of Xi'an.</p>
<p>The route passed through Yongchuan, Rongchang, Neijiang, Zizhong, Jianyang, and other counties. Along the roads and rocks, there were slogans such as "Military and Civilians Unite, Resist Aggression to the End," "Eliminate Traitors," "Kill the Japanese Bandits," and "Resistance Will Succeed, Nation-Building Will Be Achieved." The most proactive anti-Japanese slogans were seen in Rongchang County, where there were slogans such as "Consolidate and Expand the Anti-Japanese National United Front," "Prevent and Correct Compromising Speech by Traitors," "Serving Military Service is a National Duty," and "Evading Military Service is a Criminal Act." The group that inscribed these slogans was the Anti-Japanese Support Association Singing Troupe. In the countryside, such slogans are very necessary. Occasionally, I also saw the slogan "To Implement the New Life Movement, First, Stop Smoking Opium," which shows that opium may still be poisoning the rural areas of Sichuan.</p>
<p>On the first day, we had lunch in Laifeng Town, Yongchuan County. The town was very small, consisting of wooden bungalows. The restaurants were adorned with red paper Spring Festival couplets, and the couplets were all about resisting Japan. The rural restaurant's couplet read: "Farmers, Workers, Merchants, Students, and Soldiers Unite to Defeat the Aggressors, Villages, Cities, Towns, Everyone Sings of Peace." Ruifang Tea Garden's couplet read: "How Can We Live Under the Same Sky With This Hatred, May Soldiers Sacrifice Themselves and Achieve Righteousness, Slaughtering All the X People Before Stopping. We Can't Stand With the Thieves, Support the Leader and Resist Aggression To The End, Returning Our Mountains and Rivers Before We Are Satisfied." There were many other such couplets, which I will not list exhaustively.</p>
<p>There were many beggars in this town. Their appearance was completely like primitive people covering themselves with leaves. They stood shivering in front of the restaurants, waiting for the guests to finish eating, then immediately swarmed in to fight with the waiters for the leftovers.</p>
<p>Continuing forward from this town, we arrived at Rongchang County, and then Neijiang County. Not far from the county seat is Neijiang, which is not wide and the water is also shallow, but no bridge has been built. Cars must cross by ferry. In this busy time of military transport, this is indeed a major loss.</p>
<p>The car arrived at Neijiang County Town, and we stopped to spend the night. All cars traveling between Chongqing and Rongchang must stop here. Our car was slow because it was carrying too much cargo. When we arrived, it was already past nine o'clock. Cars from Chongqing and Chengdu filled the streets and alleys. There was almost no place for our car to park. It was even more difficult to find a hotel. After eating, we finally found a small room, about five feet wide and six feet long, with a plank bed, a straw mat, and a thin, dirty cotton quilt. There was nothing else. The window was about one foot wide and two feet long, with four wooden strips as window posts. Because I was unfamiliar with the local security situation, I asked the car's guard to sleep on a folding chair in my room. The driver and two other people went to a hotel they knew to discuss sleeping arrangements.</p>
<p>The next morning at 6:45 AM, we continued on our way. At 1:00 PM, we stopped at Qiuqi Town in Zizhong County for lunch. Things were not cheap either. Duck eggs cost three cents for four. Leaving Neijiang City, I saw a large wooden sign that read "Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Production Promotion Institute Sugarcane Experimental Area." From there until Zizhong, one mountain after another, all that the eyes could see was a green and yellow landscape. The green was wheat, soybeans, and vegetables, and the yellow was rapeseed flowers, probably planted after the sugarcane harvest. Seeing this situation, agricultural production is extremely rich. According to the locals, Sichuan's soybeans are second only to the Northeast, and a year of Sichuan's harvest is enough for several years of use. There are bunkers in every county, but Neijiang has the most, said to be for local bandits.</p>
<p>After Zizhong County is Jianyang County. The mountains and fields are no longer entirely green and yellow, and many mountain tops are left barren. Near the large mountain range 30 kilometers from Chengdu, agricultural production seems to be rich again, with things planted even on the mountain tops. Crossing the mountain is a lush green plain, and needless to say, agricultural production is also abundant. Having traveled through Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and then through Guangdong and Guangxi, and then arriving at such a place, I truly began to feel the vastness and richness of China. If the guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas can be sustained and developed, then even if Sichuan Province alone serves as an anti-Japanese base, I believe that the War of Resistance can achieve final victory. Not to mention the many provinces in the southwest and northwest.</p>
<p>The population seen along the way is extremely sparse. Occasionally, I saw three or four houses, all thatched cottages. The women under middle age all had short hair and their clothes were neater. The men all wore broken, earthy-colored long cloth robes, wrapped with waistbands, and their heads were wrapped with white cloth, only revealing the back of their heads. After passing Neijiang County, both men and women, old and young, all wrapped their heads with white cloth.</p>
<p>Arriving in Chengdu, the customs and habits of the people seem to be different again.</p>

<p>【Central News Agency, Mixian, 20th Dispatch】In the Yueyang area, X people have recently arrived, including over a thousand infantrymen, a cannon unit, and a thousand horses, transporting them to Yanglousi.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, Xingji, 21st Dispatch】A small contingent of X in Jing Le, along with over a thousand Kang Le Family Association reinforcements for the X, protected by three aircraft and three cannons, harassed Yantan Wumasi from the Fanjia Zhaohonglin Picun area on the morning of the 17th at 8:00 AM.

<h3>Cooperation Between the Army and Civilians in Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>Young children and old men volunteered to help in the war, officers and soldiers were moved and their courage was a hundredfold</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, Changsha, 20th Dispatch】Last month, during our army's attack on Yanglousi, the area was occupied for a period. According to the commander of a certain regiment who led the attack, when the unit was detouring near Yanglousi, they still had to cross a small river about several tens of meters wide. Although engineers had erected a bridge beforehand, the slope of the bridge was steep, making it difficult for people and horses to ascend and descend. More than a dozen nearby elementary school students happened to pass by the bridge while the engineers were working. After discovering this shortcoming, led by a person surnamed Ren, each of them picked up straw and tied it into small bundles, nailing them horizontally on the upper and lower slopes of the bridge, creating several grades. While the large army and horses were passing through, there was no slipping even with the continuous spring rain. Also, when the unit began to detour towards Yanglousi from a certain place, the roads diverged, making it difficult to determine the route. Many elderly men living in the mountains volunteered to serve as guides, showing no fear. Furthermore, the assistance provided to the troops by the people along the way in terms of drinking water, food supplies, and stretcher-bearing moved the officers and soldiers to tears, and their attacking spirit was thus redoubled, so the results of the battle were also satisfactory.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, Changsha, 20th Dispatch】The reporter met with a certain guerrilla commander of the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi border area in a certain place. According to the conversation, the high anti-Japanese sentiments of the people in the front, and the harmony between the army and the people, were unseen in the months of the war of resistance. It is really gratifying that the army and civilians in the front now truly believe that victory in the War of Resistance is certain. They know that the only question is how to work hard to speed up the arrival of victory. For this reason, the people in the front have now truly been able to do all they can to help the army. They act as guides, engage in espionage, and carry out rescue and stretcher-bearing work. To date the troop has, in three months, eliminated more than 2,000 X soldiers, burned two X warehouses, seized more than 200 rifles from the X army, and seized more than 800 rifles from the puppet army, and captured eight X soldiers.</p>
<h3>The General Association for Comforting Troops Sends Personnel to Various Places, Carrying Large Quantities of Goods, to Comfort Anti-Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st Dispatch】After holding a Spring Festival comforting people’s association in Chongqing, the National General Committee for Comforting Anti-Japanese Soldiers sent a special car to Guangxi to transport large quantities of Sichuan-produced rapeseed cake and other items because there were many wounded soldiers in Guangxi. Together with the Guangxi Friends of Wounded Soldiers Association, they packed more than 15,000 comforting bags and expanded the comfort efforts in Guangxi Province in early March. The representatives of the 6th Army and the 32nd Division were entrusted with transporting large pieces of salted radish to the front line. In addition, over 10,000 new recruits were suddenly concentrated for training and will be dispatched to the front line soon. The association has sent personnel to investigate and plans to send a delegation to organize a comforting team to bring personal comfort items. The association also considered that the situation on the northern border and the Xiangfan front line is very tense. It has decided to send a delegation to comfort the troops separately.</p>

<h3>Japanese in Shanghai Use Customs to Arrest Passengers; Vessels from Ningbo and Wenzhou Are Searched with Special Rigor</h3>
<p>【Shanghai Dispatch】The X side has taken the power it controls in the customs to add more Japanese officers to the water patrol supplementary room and search ships coming and going on the Huangpu River, and arrest innocent passengers, and connect them to the "Water Military Police" of the riverside hotel. The Customs authorities have no way to intervene. Most of these newly added police officers were originally police officers from the Japanese police station, so they are very skilled in handling affairs. The Shanghai Customs has newly established a Search and Seizure Team, which is staffed by Japanese customs officials and is responsible for conducting strict inspections of vessels traveling to and from Ningbo to find anti-Japanese elements.</p>

<h3>Excellent Results in Conscription in Guangxi</h3>
<p>【Guilin Dispatch】Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Guangxi has been the most rigorous and rapid in handling conscription among the provinces, because the basic political organization in Guangxi has been through five or six years of effort, and then the province's household registration has been clearly investigated and statistically analyzed. Counties and cities, as autonomous units, are divided into several districts, and districts are further divided into several townships, and townships are further divided into several villages. The head of the village directly manages household registration. The provincial government sends a paper order to the county, and the county government sends it to the districts and then to the townships. The heads of the townships immediately execute the order, directly reaching the village heads and then the household unit. The organization is connected, like the arm of the body, the finger of the arm, so the implementation of all government orders is particularly easy and agile. There are more than 24,900 villages in the province of Guangxi, with a population of more than 13 million, a vast area, rich resources, and abundant grain production. If located in Europe, it could establish a strong country. In recent years, after the hard work of Li Bai and Huang and other leaders, military training, political reforms, and economic construction have gradually begun to take shape. Although it has not been able to form the prosperity of modern society, it has somewhat achieved the policy of "self-sufficiency." The Zhuang adults of Guangxi, aged 18 to 35, have generally undergone three to six months of military training and have considerable military knowledge. In the early stage of the War of Resistance, each village was ordered to deploy 20 soldiers, using a lottery system to specify the order of priority. In total, more than 500,000 were selected. More than 300,000 of these 500,000 soldiers were used in various battlefields in the early stage of the War of Resistance. About 200,000 were concentrated in the rear for training and formed into regular armies, but they have not yet been sent to various battlefields. There are also tens of thousands who have been selected and prepared for deployment, but have remained in the villages. The Guangxi authorities are now planning to protect Guangxi and will bring together all the soldiers who have been selected but not yet conscripted in the early stage and organize them into special teams, which will be assigned to each county government for direct deployment. Each county will establish at least two to six special teams, with the number of teams and the number of soldiers determined by the needs of the local environment in each county. The deputy county head of each county also serves as the captain of the special team, dedicated to maintaining local security and assisting in regular military operations, in order to enhance the local self-defense capabilities. After the successive fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the early stage of the War of Resistance came to a temporary end, and the later stage of the War of Resistance began anew. However, the center of gravity of the later stage of the War of Resistance has shifted from northern Guizhou to the southwest. Guangxi is on the front line of the southwest and has a heavy responsibility to bear. As a result, the second phase of conscription in Guangxi has begun. The early conscription in Guangxi was carried out strictly in accordance with the conscription law jointly formulated by the Fifth Route Army Headquarters and the two agencies of the provincial government. Except for elementary school teachers, students, specialized technicians, township village chiefs, and those permitted to be exempted as stipulated in the regulations, regardless of their occupation, if they were adults of the appropriate age, they were all conscripted in accordance with the law. The restrictions of the conscription law were tight, and the enforcement of the conscription policy was extremely strict. There were even entire industrial and commercial enterprises where only one person was relied upon for production, or families of eight where one person was relied upon for support, or poor and unassisted individuals. Even these people were conscripted and not allowed to hire substitutes. If those who were conscripted evaded conscription or claimed to be doing business outside the area, the parents, siblings, wives, and children of those who evaded military service were detained without leniency. Last year, the conscription law previously set in Guangxi was slightly relaxed, and there were also regulations for the payment of deferment fees. Any adult of the appropriate age who was a civil servant, teacher, student, or had a special occupation and could not serve, could be allowed to pay a deferment fee of 100 yuan for one year of deferment after the head of the township or village certified that this was true before the lottery was drawn. The families of those who had previously been detained or who had their property confiscated for evading conscription were released, and this strict regulation was abolished. Now that the all-out War of Resistance has entered the later stage, Guangxi Province is holding a second phase of conscription. Further revisions have been made to the previous conscription law, and an item for military service substitution has been added. If someone is conscripted but cannot serve immediately due to circumstances, they are allowed to hire a qualified adult to substitute for them. However, if this adult has already been drawn in the lottery, when it is this adult's turn to be a soldier, they will be replaced by the other person as a soldier, and it is decided that the head of the village must employ conscripts. However, such qualified adults who substitute for conscription are limited to those who have registered in the county. Since the third revision of the conscription procedures, the people of the province have been saying that it is convenient for those who are not yet conscripted, and the number of those who volunteer to enlist is more than the number of those who substitute. Because the people are motivated by the enthusiasm to defend their homeland and protect their families, there is really no other good way to survive except to take up arms. In short, there is no need to worry about the source of soldiers in Guangxi, and there is no way to evade conscription. As long as the authorities are aware of the people's needs, are good at using regulations, and implement the conscription policy, enthusiastic and heroic young people who are willing to sacrifice everything for the country will naturally come in a continuous stream.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Department of Construction Develops Mining Industry, Establishes a Factory to Refine Tin and Sells it Outside the Province. Agricultural Products Exported Last Year Also Prospered</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency, Nanchang, 20th Dispatch】Before the war, Jiangxi Province's foreign trade was mostly exported through the Nanxun Road. After northern Jiangxi became a guerrilla area, the province's wartime trade department was established and switched to transporting goods by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and highways, which was still convenient. The Department of Construction estimates that the total value of exports in 1938 was approximately 120 million yuan, of which rice, tea, porcelain, and paper accounted for the majority, accounting for 70% of the total value. In terms of tea and rice alone last year, rice was exported to Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces, reaching about 1.2 million bags (200 jin per bag), totaling 10 million yuan. The total value of Anhui-Jiangxi red and green tea exports was over 30 million yuan, with Jiangxi accounting for half of it. The Department of Construction is now actively planning to develop mineral production and actively export it, and has set up a tin customs refining plant to refine pure tin for sale outside the province to enrich Jiangxi's economic power.</p>

<h3>Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce President Dodd's Safety Greatly Feared, Kidnapped and Taken Away, No News in Funing, British Authorities Exhaust All Efforts to Search Without Success</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing 21st] Tianjin Dispatch: It has been four days since the President of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, Dodd, was kidnapped, and there is still no trace of him. The British authorities in Tianjin are making every effort to search for him, hoping to rescue him from danger as soon as possible. The Japanese side has also agreed to "cooperate" in the joint search. All parties are becoming increasingly anxious about Dodd's safety. According to reliable sources, someone saw Dodd a few minutes after he was kidnapped. The kidnappers took Dodd out of the back door and pushed him into a car and drove away. However, the car broke down about two hundred yards away, so it stopped for repairs. At that time, several people gathered on both sides of the car to watch the car work. Although some people saw blood on Dodd's head and a worried expression, no one came to help. About twenty yards away from the repair site, there was a Chinese policeman who also did not come forward to investigate. Dodd's hands were tied behind his back, and he sat in the car for half an hour. Later, the kidnappers hired a car from a car dealership on Dagu Road and took him elsewhere. The car then accelerated towards Dagu. An investigation afterwards revealed that the license plate of the car left by the kidnappers was fake. The general opinion of foreigners here is that this was done by pro-Japanese elements.</p>
<h3>Traitor Chen Jintao Reportedly Assassinated</h3>

<h3>Loan for Aid to China Case, British Parties Unanimously Support, The House of Commons is Full of Enthusiasm, Hoping the Government Will Provide More Assistance</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 21st] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon yesterday read the China Currency Act for the second time in the House of Commons. He said that although British trade with China does not account for a large part of world trade, it is still worth protecting and assisting, especially because China has a large population, and a slight increase in the purchasing power of each person makes a big difference. The current war is a severe test of the new currency system implemented by China since 1935. The Chinese people have adopted excellent technical steps, and overseas Chinese have remitted money to pay for war expenses. The stability of the Chinese currency system in the middle of last year was only slightly disturbed or had weaker credit. If the House of Commons passes this bill, it will be of great benefit to China's future. Labor Party member Lawrence said that he supports this bill because it can encourage British trade and specifically help China resist Japan. The time may come when Britain must consider strengthening China's strength. Liberal Party member Mand also supported the bill, but expressed regret that the scope planned by the government was still too narrow. He believed that the government should allow British goods to freely enter China. The loan issue is only fulfilling the requirements of the Allied Act. Conservative Party member Botuba declared that he only regretted that this bill was not put forward earlier and that the content was not sufficient. Labor Party member Smith moved to reject the bill, believing that if Britain does not change its political and economic policies in the Far East, it will not be able to stabilize Chinese exchange rates at all. He accused the government of not being able to advocate humanitarian aid to China because it dared not offend Japan. He also said that in the past eight years, Britain has actually helped Japan to do evil. Labor Party member Dingle seconded, saying that Britain's move was the result of past non-resistance to Japanese aggression. Conservative Party member Astor said that the veto should not be discussed again. If this move can give the Chinese government and people gratitude, then both houses of parliament should unanimously pass this bill. Labor Party member Bell Garcia said that if the purpose of the bill is to promote British commerce, he will support it. Simon offered assurances, saying that this was indeed the purpose of the bill. Bell Garcia then asked whether the continuous use of this fund was in cooperation with the United States and France, as in the Three-Power Agreement. Simon replied that other governments have also assisted Chinese finance in various ways, for example, the United States purchased large amounts of silver. This proposal hopes that the House of Commons will accept it and is Britain's assistance. Deputy Minister of Finance Wallace replied to the debate from all parties, declaring that summarizing the views of the opposition party members, a loan of 10 million pounds to China is indeed very effective, and all parties also recognize that the Chinese currency system is extremely stable and is extremely supported domestically. Whether the government has assisted China in the past is not important. This bill will undoubtedly be of great help to China. He hoped that this bill could be passed immediately in the House of Commons to avoid causing a psychological impact on China. The China Currency Act was passed immediately without modification.</p>
<h3>Trip to Suizao</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Visiting General Chen Li</p>
<p>When returning to Xiangfan by car from Suixian, I visited General Chen Li, commander of the ××× Division, in ××. In September of the year before last, he went to the vicinity of Taiyuan, Shanxi, to fight, and in December he went east to northern Jiangsu, serving as the commander of the front line of the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. He began to come into contact with the × army on March 9 last year. I remember that when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched the Northern Expedition ten years ago, because he hated the Japanese army for adding obstacles in Jinan, he had the heroic words that he would definitely annihilate the Japanese army in Taierzhuang ten years later. Indeed, Taierzhuang has such a superior situation, but first, the Tengxian line in southern Shandong must be firmly defended to lure × into the trap. Commander Chen shouldered this important task that day, with the heroic sacrifice of being willing to sacrifice and not hesitating to sacrifice, even his own leg was seriously injured, he did not care, and finally completed the mission of firmly defending Tengxian and luring × into the trap. Although the second-line commander, Commander Wang Mingzhang, was unfortunately outflanked by × and died heroically in battle, it ultimately did not harm the great victory of the Taierzhuang annihilation battle.</p>
<p>× Planes Really Know How to Mess Things Up—When I met Commander Chen, just as we started talking about the battle situation in northern and central Hubei, × planes buzzed and flew over like big green flies to disturb people. Young military judge Yang Dianru, a burly man, insisted on asking us to hide under a river embankment together. However, Mr. Yang was not timid. He squatted on the embankment and looked out with his right palm: "Three planes—, —oh! They're turning around, it's really bad, I'm afraid they're going to do that!" He kept leaning over and reporting to the bottom of the embankment as if he was on the phone.</p>
<p>Commander Chen continued the previous conversation on the field, talking about the battle situation in Hubei, and comparing the entire situation between × and us, listing facts and figures to prove that we have many superior conditions compared to the × people. We should turn to using these superior conditions and persevere to the end with the × people. A defeat in a battle increases the experience twice, and we can still quickly carry out second, third, and even countless serious blows against ×, and we must beat them so that they cannot step down, and then we can achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>He said: Looking at the first phase of the War of Resistance, although the × people won several battles on the front, they have since penetrated deep into our inland mountain areas, on the one hand reducing the effectiveness of mechanized troops, and on the other hand extending the rear transport line, increasing the threat to the rear, and losing their past strength in frontal combat, giving us a full opportunity to meet them head-on. At the same time, within our interior, when the water is clear, the fish will appear. In order to gain time for a long-term war of resistance, we have gradually eliminated internal doubters, and we must strive for smooth progress in political and economic aspects to match the active progress in military needs. Chengdu is a very favorable sign for the great cause of resisting the war and building the country.</p>
<p>—Indeed, when the × army fought in the early stages, they had a bit of a "one-shot" appearance in some places. Later, after the Xuzhou Battle and the Wuhan Battle, the original shape of "re-decay, two-exhausted" gradually appeared: Shanxi "sweeping the guerrillas" is tight; Hunan and Hubei flee in all directions, without an inch; Guangzhou limits itself to the area, not daring to cross the thunder pool by one step; Although Qiongdao is ready to land, it is no different from temporarily swallowing an international bomb—these are all signs that ×'s power will decline and soon die.</p>
<p>As for our internal affairs, there will never be another Qin Hui in the government, but the front line is full of Yue Feis who are loyal and vowed to eliminate the enemy. We are not pessimistic about the future of the War of Resistance, and we are not without certainty.</p>
<p>Commander Chen Li on the Xiangfan Front</p>

<p>[Associated Press Prague 21st] German troops have been leaving Prague all day, heading southeast. It is not known whether they are heading to Luxembourg. It is also learned that in Luxembourg, the Luxembourg garrison is still fighting fiercely against Hungary. At the same time, large German troops are still advancing towards Moravia and Bohemia. The number of Jews committing suicide is endless all day long.</p>
<p>[Reuters Budapest 21st] Officials here have just denied the report that Germany has requested German troops to pass through Hungarian territory. Relations between Romania and Hungary are not very good, and both sides are taking precautions on the border. However, what the future holds depends on the evolution of the overall situation. It is believed that Germany may encourage Hungary to take action in Transylvania, but at present everything on the eastern front is semi-quiet and uncontested.</p>

<h3>French President Invited to London, Britain and France Will Issue Joint Declaration, Soviet Union Proposes Holding International Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 21st] French President Lebrun and his wife arrived in England this afternoon for an official invitation. The French President and his wife took a special train from Paris to Calais, where they changed to a special plane to sail. When leaving the French port, French warships fired 21 guns to salute. When the special ship was halfway through the strait, British special warships and the Imperial Air Force went to welcome it. The British King and Queen personally greeted them at Victoria Station.</p>
<p>[Sea Communication London 21st] French President Lebrun and his wife took the French cruiser Antioch to Britain at 1:00 pm today. When the French ship stopped at the pier, King's brother Duke Connaught went to the ship on behalf of the King to greet them. The coastal batteries fired 21 guns to salute. The French President and his wife, accompanied by the Duke and his entourage, transferred to a special train to London.</p>
<p>[Reuters Moscow 20th] According to reliable authoritative sources, the Soviet Union supports the joint discussion of the European situation proposed by Britain and France, and will propose to immediately convene a joint meeting of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, and the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 20th] The Soviet government today submitted a proposal to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, advocating convening a conference of peace-loving countries in both worlds. According to general estimates, the British government may express to the Soviet Union that in the current serious international situation, it is practically difficult to convene responsible authorities from various countries to meet in person.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency London 21st] According to a report by the foreign affairs correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, Russia's participation in the Six-Power Agreement depends on whether it can guarantee the security of the Far Eastern border, because the Moscow government is concerned about the safety of all aspects in the event of a war. The Daily Express expects that the Six-Power Declaration will be issued within 48 hours.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London 21st] It is learned that the ambassadors of various countries here have notified their governments, expressing that the European situation is indeed quite serious, but it does not seem that an incident is about to occur. It is generally agreed that the British government is now trying to obtain cooperation with the Soviet Union before deciding on action. Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to meet with the Polish Ambassador today, which will determine whether Poland agrees to participate in the anti-German activities led by the United Kingdom. Similarly, the intentions of Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria will also be tested.</p>
<p>British Cabinet Discusses Central European Situation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 21st] The British government is currently discussing the situation in Central Europe with the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Bulgaria, while also taking precautionary measures in all aspects. The Cabinet convened a meeting at 10:30 am yesterday and adjourned at 12:15 pm. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson also attended and reported. When the Cabinet held a meeting yesterday, opposition leaders Attlee, Greenwood (member of the British Labour Party Executive Committee), Sinclair, etc., went to Downing Street to inquire about the development of recent events. Foreign Secretary Halifax stepped forward and saw the British King. The Foreign Ministers of France and Romania, and the Chargé d'Affaires of the German Embassy, also visited the Foreign Office yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 21st] Since Germany threatened Romania, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union has become closer. This week, British Foreign Secretary and Soviet Ambassador Maisky had a meeting. Although it is not confirmed that the meeting was to discuss the formation of an alliance, both sides did give a frank review of the European situation. British officials only stated that the two sides decided to pay close attention to the development of the situation and maintain close contact with each other. However, according to reliable sources, what the two sides talked about that day was not limited to Anglo-Soviet cooperation, but also the issue of cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union and other countries to prevent aggression.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 20th] Responsible sources said that the Foreign Secretary gave a report on the international situation at the Cabinet meeting today. The Cabinet immediately decided in principle to aid Romania and establish a collective security system in Eastern Europe to prevent Germany from expanding its influence to the Black Sea coast. It is said that the government is making every effort to organize a group, the nature of which is similar to the alliance that was used to combat Napoleon I's hegemony more than a hundred years ago. It is generally expected that the British and French authorities will issue a joint declaration after French President Lebrun's invitation to visit Britain (this month's 21st), stating that both sides are determined to prevent new German aggression.</p>
<p>The United States Uses Economic Aid to Help Democratic Countries</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 20th] Most believe that the US government will not take active action on the rumored upcoming conference of peace front countries, because the US government can only provide economic and moral assistance to the peace front countries. Assuming that the United States sends troops overseas to participate in the war, it will not be supported by the American public. It is said that the United States has proposed to European democratic countries that it will provide economic weapons as their backing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 20th] Authoritative sources said that in the coming months, the government will recall the ambassadors to Germany, Italy, and Japan for consultation. Congress is expected to immediately review the unreviewed parts of the national defense bill. At the same time, the United States will fully restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, appointing Stein Hardt as the ambassador to the Soviet Union. Pittman said in a broadcast speech last night that he will propose to Congress that the President should have greater power, the degree of which should be even stronger than what the President has requested. The President is scheduled to discuss foreign policy issues with key members of Congress today.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Berlin 20th] Hitler met with cabinet members and military leaders today to discuss closely the firm resistance caused by the Nazi expansion policy in Europe. At the same time, Hitler ordered the recall of the ambassador to Paris.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Paris 20th] German Ambassador to France Chezak took a train home for duty at 6:15 pm today.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 21st] The Daily Mail's foreign affairs correspondent declared, "Londoners are quite worried because the situation is getting tense and there is a need to convene a conference of the powers quickly, as Moscow has proposed. The opinions of Britain and France clearly believe that a clear declaration signed by the countries concerned and signed by other countries is the first concrete step in establishing a new European security system based on mutual assistance." The correspondent said that the Soviet Union is prepared to do its best to participate to satisfy the wishes of the Western powers. He said, "It is rumored in diplomatic circles that the environment has forced Germany's eastward policy or will tend to stop, but Germany's next move may still be directed towards Lithuania in order to obtain Memel. Lithuania currently has no intention of taking effective resistance, but Poland will take a serious attitude towards the German army's invasion of Lithuania." At the same time, it is believed that the next development of the situation is related to Italy's request to France.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Speaks in the Upper House on the Seriousness of the European Situation: Free Negotiations Have Been Ruined, Germans Will Eventually Regret Their Actions in Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax (see right picture) spoke today in the Upper House about recent events in Europe. "In a time of crisis, all partisan opinions seem to disappear," he said, to great applause. He stated that this incident has indeed caused a profound shock to our country and to people in foreign nations. It should be especially noted that when the Czech President and Foreign Minister were en route to Germany and negotiations had not yet begun, Germany occupied two Czech towns on the evening of the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>Occupies Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>Regarding Hitler's declaration that Czech territory was under German protection, Halifax said, "What we should pay attention to is that although the current administrative head established in Czechoslovakia is said to hold the position of head of state, and the protectorate is said to be autonomous and independent, Germany has established a resident official in Prague who has veto power over Czech legislation. Foreign affairs and the protection of foreigners are entirely in the hands of the German government. The German government also deploys troops to garrison the territory and establish administrative organs. The protectorate is bound by the German Customs Union. At the same time, the German government can promulgate laws and take measures to maintain security and order. As a result of these actions, the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia can now be said to be complete." Halifax then discussed Germany's reasons for defending its actions, saying, "I cannot believe that the sudden decision of some Slovak leaders to secede from Czechoslovakia was not instigated by external forces." After briefly recounting the facts, he said, "We cannot help but conclude that all the conflicts before Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia were</p>
<p>Premeditated</p>
<p>The letter from the German President to the Czech President persuading his people to surrender is not worth discussing. Judging from the situation at the time, the Czech President was on his way to Berlin, and Czech territory had already been occupied by German troops. Intelligent people will easily come to the conclusion that the so-called negotiations were just a smokescreen. It is even possible that Germany used force to intimidate and issued an ultimatum to Czechoslovakia. The Czech authorities, in order to save their people from rapid destruction by aircraft, had no choice but to submit." He also said that Germany's claim that Czechoslovakia's existence posed a threat to Germany was simply not credible to everyone. "I believe that the actual situation is that Germany's strength is superior to that of Czechoslovakia, and it is acting unilaterally, taking itself as the supreme arbiter. Under these circumstances, the British government believes that immediate action is necessary." When he mentioned the suspension of the visit to Germany by Secretary of Commerce Stanley and Minister for Overseas Trade Hudson, he said, "This is the government's intervention in the informal contact between the industrial and commercial sectors of the two countries. We believe that under such circumstances,</p>
<p>There is no Point in Talking About</p>
<p>Promoting cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, all such matters are indefinitely postponed." He then discussed the recall of Ambassador to Germany Henderson, saying, "I believe that we have made the British government's attitude fully clear to the German government, and although we cannot hope that our protest to Germany will have any great effect, this move is perfectly justified." He continued to discuss German figures using the historical development of the British Empire to justify their actions today, saying, "The principles on which the British Empire is based are self-governance. Everything we have done has left traces of freedom and autonomy. Our past actions have never suppressed freedom. We certainly acknowledge that Germany has more interests in Southeastern Europe than we do, but this cannot be compared with the use of force, in violation of international law, to oppress an independent country." Referring to the opposition party's claim that Chamberlain's policy in Munich was his personal policy, he said, "If this refers to the policy being formulated by the Prime Minister with his</p>
<p>Full Energy</p>
<p>Ideals and determination, I will not object. But if it is said that the policy has not obtained the full cooperation of myself and other cabinet members, then I will solemnly object." When the Foreign Secretary made this statement, government parliamentarians applauded. Some members of the House of Commons also cheered from the gallery. He continued, "The purpose of the Munich Agreement was twofold. First, in the extremely difficult circumstances at the time, to seek a fair solution as much as possible, because the problem was real, and if we wanted to maintain peace in Europe, urgent measures had to be taken. Under the circumstances and information available at the time, I have no doubt that the government took this measure. Second, it was to use the method of free negotiations to guarantee the security of the people of Europe and to lay the foundation for resolving future disputes. But based on what we have seen, this purpose has already been destroyed by the current situation." Regarding the general public's criticism of Britain for</p>
<p>Unwarranted Trust</p>
<p>In Germany's assurances, he said that neither the Prime Minister nor himself had ever forgotten the stark difference between believing and hoping. "But we have always believed that belief is born of prolonged hope." He then discussed Hitler's actions, saying, "Before the Munich Agreement, Hitler still adhered to his own creed, that is, to expel non-Germans from Germany. But now he has broken this principle, because he has now annexed eight million Czechs, which is clearly contrary to his inherent philosophy." He then recalled that in September of last year, Hitler insisted on the principle of national self-determination, claiming that this was the foundation of Germany's entire attitude, but that some facts were far from this principle. "However, let us not discuss whether the treatment of 250,000 Germans is reasonable, but now eight million Czechs are enslaved. But this cannot be regarded as a remedy. Will we believe that Germany will again adopt a new policy</p>
<p>Attempt to Rule</p>
<p>Non-Germans? This serious question has been raised all over the world. The occupation of Czechoslovakia was completed by this new method of further advancement. The world now sees a new division in the scope of international technology. Separatism in various countries has re-emerged. This is not only for the benefit of separatists but also for the benefit of the German Empire. This method is extremely simple and is progressing daily, and there is really no mistake. Can we guarantee that this will not happen elsewhere? Germany's neighboring countries are all in danger. Every independent and free country has received a warning of danger. I am very pleased that Romania has denied receiving an ultimatum, but it is not surprising that Romania and other countries have expressed serious concern about the events of the past few days." He spoke of the situation of aiding refugees, saying that the government will continue to make every effort to alleviate all the results of this incident, but regrettably, the success of all plans depends on the attitude of the German government. In the past few years, the British people have been eager to maintain</p>
<p>Friendly Relations</p>
<p>With the German people. Our people, because we do not insist on the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles, are willing to remedy them. However, in the past few years, every opportunity for mutual adjustment that could be carried out has been obstructed by the actions of the government. Not long after the Munich Conference, the government took every measure that shocked the world. The German actions of last week have hindered every step of economic cooperation between the two countries. It is difficult to predict when it can be restored. The British government had no choice but to realize this event, so it is consulting with various autonomous territories and other national governments. Although there have been many times in history of</p>
<p>Domination of Europe</p>
<p>The results have been disastrous. If historical facts are a lesson, the Germans will eventually regret their actions in Czechoslovakia."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 20th] Romania's important commercial negotiations with Germany are extremely difficult. Political figures speculate that Romania is expected to conclude an agreement with the German economic delegation within this week. It is generally expected that the agreement will complete the German-Romanian business agreement concluded in November last year. It is said that according to the new agreement, the amount of goods exchanged between the two countries will increase. This increase is due to Germany's inability to pay with current funds. Germany will probably get more oil from Romania, either taken from oil fields, opened by Germany, or taken from existing oil fields. Well-informed sources believe that the attitude of this negotiation is nothing more than to promote business between the two friendly countries. At the same time, Romania's relations with Hungary are very friendly. The Romanian authorities have ordered the border guards to avoid conflicts with the Hungarian army.</p>
<h3>British Parties Gradually Unite, Opposition Supports Firm Stance, Labour MPs Question Czech Incident</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Since Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham, parliamentary opinion has clearly changed this weekend. The opposition party's attitude of criticism has already changed. Today, when Chamberlain stepped into the House of Commons, opposition MPs also cheered him along with government MPs. At this time of difficulty, MPs of all parties and factions unanimously believe that Britain should adopt a firm stance. The government's action should naturally receive the support of the opposition party. There is no sign of cooperation between the Labour Party and the government party, but there are no more opposition MPs who are able to say that Chamberlain must step down.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] At the meeting of the House of Commons today, Labour MP Mr. Peng asked, "In view of the fact that Germany has forcibly occupied all the Czech military raw materials and factories, does the Prime Minister intend to revise the national defense plan?" Chamberlain said that in his speech on March 10, he mentioned that national life must be considered from the perspective of national security, which of course includes the national defense plan. Labour MP Ms. Wilkinson asked whether this included submitting a ban on the sale of pig iron and scrap iron to Germany to the British Iron and Steel Association, as was done last year. The Prime Minister replied that this can also be called a part of national life. The Prime Minister also said in response to another question that, to his personal knowledge, before the Czech President accepted Hitler's conditions on March 15, he had not received a written ultimatum. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson received instructions on March 17 to notify the German government that Britain was willing to bluntly express to Germany that it believed that the events of the past few days had not only completely destroyed the Munich Agreement but also denied the spirit of peace resolution through consensus of negotiators. The British Ambassador also received instructions to protest to Germany the use of force to change Czechoslovakia, believing that this action, no matter what legal point of view, was unfounded. There was also a question asking whether the Prime Minister had witnessed the report published in the newspaper that Hitler threatened to bomb Prague to force the Czech President to accept his demands. The Prime Minister gave an affirmative answer. He said, "The British government is still studying the entire situation in Czechoslovakia."</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador to Germany Summoned Home, Carries Letter from Hitler</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] The Italian ambassador was recently summoned home to report to Mussolini. He did not leave this publicly. Newspapers also did not publish the news of his return home. It is understood that he carried a handwritten letter from Hitler to Mussolini.</p>
<h3>US-German Relations May Be Severed, Strongly Protests Occupation of Czechoslovakia, Condemns Violation of International Law</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Today, the State Department officially notified the German Embassy that it does not recognize the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Official news, the US government has lodged a protest with the German Embassy in the United States. The wording is unprecedentedly strong. Some parties indicated that this protest may lead to the severance of US-German diplomatic relations. It is reported that the US protest letter condemns Germany's invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia as violating international law and threatening world peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The US State Department yesterday instructed its minister to Czechoslovakia, Mr. Karl, to close the embassy in Prague. The status of American diplomatic personnel in that area will be reduced to consul general.</p>
<h3>Romanian-German Trade Agreement to Be Renegotiated</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, Daily] Romania and Germany will sign a limited trade agreement this Wednesday. The agreement will be an extension of the existing agreements between the two countries. It is said that the crude oil supplied by Romania to Germany is only a small part and has little to do with the original requirements.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>A Salute to Overseas Chinese Returning Home to Serve the Country</h3>
<p>Yesterday's evening newspaper reported that the team of technical personnel organized by overseas Chinese in Jicheng, Nanyang, had arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago, and that 208 members of the Singapore Overseas Chinese National Salvation Team had returned to the country to serve, had safely arrived in Saigon, and would enter Guangxi and Yunnan from Saigon via Hanoi in batches on the 18th, 19th, and 2nd to serve in various industries. These news make us feel an immeasurable joy and excitement!</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is rapidly entering the second stage. If we cannot quickly strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front line, develop guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines, and cultivate new forces in the rear, then not only will we not be able to achieve the ultimate victory in the struggle and obtain the final victory, but we will also not be able to stop the unlimited incursion and will not be able to save the nation from final demise. If we want to accurately and quickly complete the above three urgent tasks, we must first implement the general spiritual mobilization of the national people and the general mobilization of all the living forces of the entire Chinese nation. However, in view of the tragic massacre and trampling of domestic compatriots in the 20-odd months of the War of Resistance and the great loss of vitality, as well as the impossibility of achieving the launch and realization of the latent forces of domestic compatriots in one day or one night, what is hoped of our overseas Chinese compatriots is of utmost importance and urgency. Our overseas Chinese compatriots have a particularly strong national consciousness and bear the glorious tradition of helping the motherland. At this time when the motherland has entered a critical stage in the struggle for independence and freedom, it is hoped that our overseas Chinese will promote self-esteem and self-confidence and enthusiastically come to serve!</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to offering here the most sublime and intimate national revolutionary salute to the overseas Chinese who have already returned to the country to serve, on the one hand, we also hope that the overseas public opinion circles and educational circles will encourage overseas Chinese, and on the other hand, we hope that the government will quickly determine the overall plan and give special rewards to overseas Chinese who return to the country to serve. At the same time, there are things that we cannot help but say: First, according to the actual situation described in communications from various parts of the country, we hope that the government will earnestly guarantee the freedom of the national salvation movement under centralized leadership, and that the speeches and actions of all parties, prejudices, stubborn elements, and latent compromisers and pro-Japanese elements that hinder the national salvation movement should be thoroughly cleaned up. Second, there are still many overseas Chinese and youths in Hong Kong, Macao, and other special areas who are unaware of the shame of national subjugation, indulge in extravagant and romantic decadent lives, and even have national traitors who evade national law, spread rumors and fallacies, and promote Japan and undermine our country's united resistance. This kind of scum, traitors, and collaborators are really a disgrace to the glorious history of our overseas Chinese. The latter is forbidden by national laws and human morality, and the former is also intolerable by overseas Chinese with conscience and backbone. We must at least use the power of public opinion to sanction them.</p>
<h3>Weaknesses of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>—Shi Chang</p>
<p>Translated from Pravda, Moscow</p>
<p>Judging from the form of Japanese operations in China, the Japanese army's actions are very mechanized. Its main forces are often concentrated at a designated location. The Japanese army is more accustomed to taking encirclement actions and rarely takes direct frontal assault tactics to force the Chinese army to withdraw from its inherent territories. Most of the Japanese army has undergone rigorous training, especially in tactics of attack and night raid. Mechanized units and cavalry units can travel 25 miles a day, and infantry units can also travel 18 miles a day.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese army is not good at face-to-face melee warfare. On the contrary, everyone knows that the Chinese army is good at melee combat. When the Japanese and Chinese armies approach, they cannot withstand the Chinese army's bayonets. To cite an example: In the battle between the Japanese and Chinese armies in Bazhi, Yining, in the middle of last year, on both sides of the canal, this was a very intense war. The forces of both sides were very close. Except for broadswords and bayonets, other military instruments lost their effectiveness. Therefore, shortly after the start of the war, the Japanese army could not hold on and retreated, with more than 2,000 killed and injured.</p>
<p>The Japanese army dispatched to China has tanks, aircraft, and engineering teams. In terms of military equipment, the Chinese army is far inferior to the Japanese army. However, the Chinese army does not lose heart and shows an excellent spirit of brave resistance. Giving a serious blow to the "Imperial Army"!</p>
<p>The Japanese commanders underestimated the strength of the Chinese army. They believed that the Chinese army was poorly equipped and poorly trained and would never be able to cope with scientific modern warfare. This caused a major strategic mistake. Now the number of Japanese troops stationed in the occupied areas of China is insufficient and they are always vulnerable to Chinese army attacks. The Japanese army is also well aware of this, but its strength is weak and there are not enough troops to allocate. Even in important transportation lines, only a small number of troops can be stationed. The Japanese army's rear defense is also not complete and appropriate. Japanese commanders often declare "victory" and the domestic chaebols echo each other," holding celebrations, etc. This is just a comforting," deceiving the country and deceiving themselves. In essence, the real situation has reached a dangerous period.</p>
<p>How many troops can Japan mobilize? Opinions differ from all parties, and the estimates of foreign newspapers also vary. According to statistics from China, Britain, and France, as of December 31, 1938, the Japanese army included 1.2 million troops, 4,500 cannons, 1,800 tanks, and 2,000 aircraft. This is a more reliable statistic.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of the Japanese army is drawn from the civilian class, while most of the officers are professional soldiers, landlords, and wealthy people. In this Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army fully demonstrated a despicable and low morality. The killings, robberies, rapes, and other misconduct in the occupied areas are ironclad evidence of the Japanese army's lack of discipline and lack of good morals.</p>
<p>In foreign newspapers, we can often see reports of anti-war sentiments in the Japanese army. In reality, the anti-war sentiments in the Japanese army are very high. Often, some small units refuse to obey orders to go to the front line. Of course, after these rebellious troops are discovered, they are immediately shot. In Shanghai and Nanjing, several batches of soldiers have been escorted to the rear for punishment because of "rebellious" activities. Many Japanese soldiers have been demoted as a result of such incidents. Japanese naval officers often encounter many difficulties due to the refusal of their subordinates to obey orders.</p>
<p>In Japan, many people often pretend to be sick or suddenly disappear to avoid participating in military service. In Kyushu, a group of people were forcibly conscripted into the reserves, but they were all opposed to the war, and therefore, rebellions and suicides occurred everywhere. People forced to join the army and armed to fight drink strong alcohol and smoke opium in order to temporarily forget the war.</p>
<p>In reality, we can foresee that as the war prolongs day by day, the morale of the Japanese people and the spirit of the Japanese army will greatly decline.</p>

<h3>Amidst Tensions in Europe, Hong Kong's Defenses Are Further Strengthened; Commander of the Army, General McNair, Will Visit the Governor of Australia in Australia; 550 British Troops Arrived in Hong Kong on a Ship Yesterday Morning to Reinforce Defenses</h3>
<p>Hitler tore up the Munich Agreement and openly announced the annexation of Czechoslovakia, and even moved his troops eastward. The winds of Europe suddenly became tense. The British government is always concerned about the defense of Hong Kong. In order to cope with this dangerous situation, the Hong Kong authorities are also actively reorganizing their military forces and preparing for self-defense. In recent years, the defense strength of the army, navy, and air force has greatly increased through hard work. Everything is prepared for wartime, which is enough to resist any foreign aggression with surplus.</p>
<p>Army Commander Scheduled to Visit the Governor of Australia</p>
<p>In order to protect the safety of Hong Kong, the military authorities, in addition to actively strengthening military equipment, are also conducting liaison with neighboring friendly countries. The two countries of Annam and Siam, which are slightly farther away from Hong Kong, and the Portuguese colony of Macau, which is nearby, have recently been constantly employing commissioners to consolidate diplomatic relations, so as to form a unified force with the Singapore military port, so as to be able to respond to each other in times of trouble. A few months ago, British Navy Commander-in-Chief in China, Nobel, visited the authorities of Siam and Australia one after another, bearing heavy responsibilities, and its intentions were also very significant. According to official sources, the British Army Commander-in-Chief in China, Major General McNair, will also take a ship to visit the Governor of Australia. The date has been set for April 6. Brigadier Thomson will be traveling with him. It is said that McNair's trip also bears a liaison mission. Hong Kong sincerely believes that Australia is geographically dependent on each other, and Macau is adjacent to our Zhongshan. It contains a great role in military measures. In addition, the Governor of Macau, Sir Barbosa, will return to Portugal recently to ask for instructions. He will stay in Lisbon for a short time before returning to Macau to take office. However, the trip to Portugal will be after General McNair's visit to Australia.</p>
<p>550 British Troops Arrived by Ship Yesterday</p>
<p>The British government's active military deployment in Hong Kong and liaison with neighboring friendly countries is as mentioned above. At the same time, the number of ships stationed in Hong Kong and the number of soldiers are also increasing from time to time, so that Hong Kong's defenses can reach the state of being impregnable. Recently, dozens of army officers and 550 British navy personnel were sent from there to reinforce Hong Kong on the transport ship Lancashire. The ship arrived at 6:30 yesterday morning and was berthed in the sea opposite the naval dockyard. After this batch of soldiers arrived in Hong Kong, they landed one after another and entered a military camp. The military appearance was very grand. It was also found that after this batch of British troops arrived in Hong Kong, a large number of British troops will be coming soon. Once the army barracks on Prince Edward Road in Sham Shui Po are completed, this batch of British troops can be transferred in batches. Although the authorities have not formally announced the future increase in the number of army and navy soldiers in Hong Kong, it is generally estimated to be between four and six brigades.</p>
<p>Three Major Forts Conduct Live-Fire Exercises</p>
<p>The eastern and western forts in Hong Kong have been ordered by the authorities for the past ten days to conduct live-fire shooting to become proficient. The West Fort of Yizhou and the Fort of Drunkard's Cap conducted artillery exercises at the same time the day before yesterday (20th). The White Sand Bay Fort is scheduled to conduct exercises in Area A from 6:00 am to 12:00 pm on the 23rd of tomorrow. (3) During the exercise period, all large and small ships should be careful to avoid approaching that area. In addition, the Army Headquarters held a gas exercise from 4:00 pm to 5:30 pm yesterday. Army Commander-in-Chief McNair personally arrived at the scene. The British Army Brigade stationed in Hong Kong was also ordered to send personnel to participate. The results of the exercise were very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>× Vessel Coastal Search and Seizure of Grain - Three Cargo Boats Engage in Desperate Battle with × - × Cannon Fire Aboard Vessel Causes Fire, Multiple × Soldiers Knocked into the Sea</h3>
<p>In recent days, × warships have repeatedly confiscated licenses from fishing boats setting out to sea.</p>
<p>The remaining × forces entrenched in Guangzhou, due to supply difficulties, face dwindling food supplies, leading to a recent food panic, with people living in constant anxiety. Furthermore, many × soldiers, having been away from their homeland for a long time, are weary of war and yearn for home. × Chieftains, fearing the dispersal of their troops, falsely declared to the soldiers that reinforcements were arriving and that food supplies would be replenished. Recently, they have resorted to forcibly arming fishing boats and directing them to search and purchase grain from our cargo boats along the coast to meet their needs. However, the gains are limited, like a cup of water trying to extinguish a burning cart of firewood, and have little effect.</p>
<p>Three Cargo Boats Near the Harbor Bomb and Sink One × Boat</p>
<p>According to a fisherman who returned to port and reported to the Fishermen's Association, his boat set out from Shau Kei Wan on the evening of the 15th of this month to fish. The next day at noon, while sailing in the waters near the Guangdong sea boundary, they spotted four armed × fishing boats chasing three cargo boats, intending to search and seize rice. The × boats fired warning shots along the way, ordering them to stop. The three cargo boats, with resistance as their only hope, devised a plan of "breaking the cauldrons and sinking the boats," preparing for a desperate battle with the ×. When the × boats approached, the three cargo boats remained calm and quickly fired several volleys of fishing cannons at the ×. One × boat was unable to dodge in time and was immediately hit, catching fire and being completely shattered. Several × soldiers perished in the flames. The remaining three × boats, intending to retaliate, fired several volleys at the three cargo boats, but missed. The three cargo boats calmly fought back, retreating while battling, eventually exhausting the × ammunition. Unable to achieve their goal, the × boats retreated in defeat. The three cargo boats also dared not pursue them. As a result of the battle, the three cargo boats suffered no losses and sailed away safely.</p>
<p>Cargo Boats Burned and Plundered - Fishing Boats' Licenses Confiscated</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a report received by the Fishermen's Association yesterday, several fishing boats, in a group, were fishing near Daigan Island. At noon on the 17th, while they were fishing, they suddenly heard the sound of gunfire. Fearing an accident, they quickly raised their sails and fled. After reaching a safe location, they used binoculars to observe from afar and witnessed two cargo boats being intercepted by several × rubber boats firing shots. The cargo boats resisted, and there was an exchange of fire for about half an hour. The cargo boats, unable to withstand the attack, retreated hastily. The × soldiers relentlessly pursued them. The two cargo boats, being chased by the × boats, fled for their lives. One of them was unfortunately captured by the ×. The × first moved all the grain from the cargo boat onto their rubber boats, threw all the crew members into the sea, and then set fire to the boat before leaving with a whoop. In addition, the association has received repeated reports from fishermen returning to port in recent days stating that whenever they encounter × warships, their boat licenses are always taken away, but they are not otherwise harmed. It is suspected that the × are attempting to impersonate Hong Kong registered fishing boats to come and go in this port, in order to deceive and confuse.</p>

<h3>Firewood from the New Territories - Increasing Numbers Transported to Hong Kong for Sale - Multiple Trucks Transporting in Rotation Daily - Low Prices Allow Firewood Vendors to Reap Substantial Profits</h3>
<p>The supply of firewood in Hong Kong is extremely large. A month ago, due to the impact of the current situation, the source was reduced, which caused a firewood shortage in Hong Kong. Although firewood merchants worked hard to purchase large quantities of firewood from Mouzhou and the Philippines and transport it to Hong Kong for supply, the firewood shortage gradually subsided. However, even now, the aftereffects still linger, and the price of firewood is the highest it has been in many years. It was found that when the firewood shortage first occurred, the villagers in the New Territories considered it an opportunity to profit, and they transported a large amount of firewood from the New Territories to Hong Kong for sale. Every day, groups of people carried firewood to Hong Kong in an endless stream. Because the price was much cheaper than Po Chai or Wu Chai firewood, the residents of the peninsula eagerly purchased it. Therefore, every day, villagers carried firewood to vacant lots in Kowloon City, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and Sham Shui Po to display and sell it, and it was sold out in an instant. For several months, this kind of business by the villagers has never stopped. Because of the lure of profit, people were paying attention to it, and firewood merchants took money to the New Territories to collect various types of firewood, hiring trucks to transport it back to Hong Kong for sale, making huge profits. The number of firewood merchants engaged in this business has greatly increased. Currently, there are six or seven trucks that are hired by firewood merchants every day to transport firewood from the New Territories to Hong Kong in rotation. The minimum daily quantity is estimated to be around 1400-1500 piculs. Furthermore, the villagers in the Chinese territory have also begun to cut down a large amount of mountain grass and new firewood to supply to the firewood merchants in Hong Kong who come to the New Territories to collect it. Therefore, the sales of firewood from the New Territories to Hong Kong are increasing daily. This should greatly assist the supply of firewood in Hong Kong. Moreover, the price of this firewood is lower than that of Po Chai or pine firewood. It is only six or seven Hong Kong cents per picul when purchased locally in the New Territories. After adding a few cents for transportation and selling it in Hong Kong for one dollar and twenty or thirty cents per picul, a profit of more than 50% can be made. It is foreseeable that firewood merchants will increasingly flock to this route to seek a source of firewood.</p>

<h3>Rumor that the Central Government has Approved - Tax-Free Import of Foreign Rice - Quota Set at 1.2 Million Hectoliters - Allocated to the Chaoshan Area</h3>
<p>In the past half-month, the rice shortage in various counties of Guangdong has been severe, and fellow villagers from various counties in Hong Kong have been seeking relief. They have also urgently requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt foreign rice from import duties. However, purchasing foreign rice damages foreign exchange, which is not as good as purchasing domestic rice. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed this intention back to the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce. Under these circumstances, whether the request for tax-free import of foreign rice can achieve its purpose is a matter of concern for those who must eat the rice of the Cantonese people. According to reliable sources, the Central Ministry of Finance, considering that the rice shortage in Guangdong Province is indeed severe and that it is not easy to purchase domestic rice at the moment, has adopted expedient measures, approving the import of 1.2 million hectoliters of tax-free foreign rice to Guangdong Province for emergency relief. Of this 1.2 million hectoliters, 700,000 hectoliters will be allocated to the Chaoshan area, and 200,000 hectoliters to the Jiangmen area. There is currently no news regarding the request from the Zhongshan area. The Ministry of Finance has instructed the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance to send personnel to investigate. Wu Tiecheng and Li Xiangen, important officials from the Zhongshan County Hostel, are currently working on this matter and it is expected that there will be a satisfactory outcome in the future. It has been found that various regional organizations in Hong Kong related to this matter, such as the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce, the Siyi Chamber of Commerce, the Qushan Chamber of Commerce, and the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, have not received formal approvals. Rice merchants in Hong Kong are currently paying close attention. Recently, due to the urgent requests from various counties for tax-free import of foreign rice, rice merchants in Hong Kong have been purchasing and transporting rice from Annam to Hong Kong to prepare for the market. In the past three or four days, many rice ships have arrived in Hong Kong, and domestic rice has been arriving steadily, causing rice prices to drop slightly.</p>

<h3>Macao Authorities Seek to Improve Foreign Trade - Deeply Hope Hong Kong Merchants will go to Macao to Develop Industries - Macao Chinese Representative Sent a Letter of Greetings Yesterday - The Factory Federation will Send an Inspection Team</h3>
<p>In order to improve local foreign trade and develop industry and commerce, Dr. Barbosa, the Governor of Macao, is very eager to cooperate with the Hong Kong industrial community. Liang Houyuan, the Macao Chinese representative, recently sent a letter to the Hong Kong Federation of Manufacturers, inviting them to send an inspection team to Macao to conduct on-site research as a basis for discussing cooperation. The Factory Federation has expressed acceptance of Mr. Liang's proposal and has scheduled a meeting for this Wednesday to discuss the trip to Macao. It is expected that preparations can be completed by the middle of next month. The reclamation project in the Nam Van area of Macao has been completed. The following is the letter from Mr. Liang: "Dear Sirs, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, people have been displaced and flocked to Hong Kong and Macao, waiting to be fed. More than 10,000 helpless refugees have been left in Macao. Although the overseas Chinese have tried their best to donate, it is still difficult to provide sufficient relief. Moreover, the long-term war of resistance is underway, and the refugees must rely on long-term relief. The overseas Chinese businessmen in Macao have seen this and planned to revive and develop industries, using work as a form of relief, and the Macao government has expressed sympathy and agreed to support and increase convenience. Moreover, products sold to Portuguese territories can enjoy preferential tax rates, and Mr. Jia Liren, the general manager of the British Power and Light Company in Macao, has also expressed his willingness to assist. I think that the friendship between friendly countries is so benevolent, and our compatriots should work even harder. We are currently soliciting opinions on the direction of the industry, but we have limited knowledge and the building may not be supported by a single beam. We have always admired your association for bringing together industry giants from home and abroad, with rich experience and wise planning. You will certainly be able to provide guidance on this matter, and because it concerns the relief of our compatriots, we dare to send this letter, requesting that your association organize an inspection team to come and inspect, and provide detailed guidance to serve as a compass."</p>

<p>Special Feature of this Newspaper</p>
<h3>Glad Tidings from the New Capital: An Interview with Principal Chen Bingquan</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Li Yinglin, Wu Dingxin, and Chen Bingquan, the three university presidents, went to Chongqing to attend the Third National Education Conference, bringing back the new seedlings of education. Upon hearing the news, the reporter made a special trip to visit them yesterday, hoping to share the information with the readers. Although it was a pity that I could not meet Presidents Li and Wu as they were not at the school, Principal Chen Bingquan's eloquent talk was enough to make people rejoice.</p>
<p>(I) No Room for Doubt</p>
<p>First of all, the reporter inquired about the general situation in Chongqing and the central government that had not yet been published in the newspaper. Principal Chen said: During the conference, the central government made many important reports on the current situation of the war of resistance, some of which were military secrets and could not be made public. Premier Kong's report on borrowing from democratic countries and Minister Wang's analysis of diplomacy were both exciting. Minister He's report, based on precise figures, was especially encouraging and increased confidence that the war of resistance would surely achieve final victory. Wang's defection was purely a personal act and had no impact on the overall situation. From any point of view, it is gratifying to see that from top to bottom, everyone is working hard in a planned and step-by-step manner under a set national policy. Minister Chen is actively promoting the implementation of wartime education, and Peng Xuepei is also performing his duties. Rumors of resignation, detention, and other rumors are all conspiracies of × people to sow discord and are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Principal Chen also solemnly said: In Hong Kong, some people may have some doubts about the war of resistance, thinking that some people may advocate peace. However, after personally arriving in Chongqing, one can suddenly believe that there is absolutely no room for doubt. Under the atmosphere of hard work to support the war of resistance, the future of the war of resistance is very optimistic.</p>
<p>(II) Solemnity Replaces Debauchery, Thrift Replaces Luxury</p>
<p>In the development of the overall national policy in a secure and methodical manner, the atmosphere of our wartime capital has also changed. This change in atmosphere is another guarantee of final victory.</p>
<p>The Three People's Principles Youth League is flourishing. The central government's love for and trust in young people, as well as the youth's support for the government and love for the leader, are all miracles created by the flames of the war of resistance and are infinitely inspiring!</p>
<p>Public officials are solemnly performing their duties and are strictly prohibited from entering entertainment venues. When it is necessary to host a banquet, the cost of each Chinese meal should not exceed eight yuan, and the cost of each Western meal should not exceed one yuan. The most interesting thing is the "buffet." A pottery utensil is divided into four compartments with bamboo strips, containing four dishes, plus soup, rice, and fruit, each serving costs only fifty cents. This time, Chairman Chiang and other officials hosted a banquet for the attending members, using such a "buffet."</p>
<p>——After listening to the reporter, I hope that the atmosphere of "prohibiting entry into entertainment venues" and "buffets" can be popularized among the middle-class and above in various parts of the rear, especially here in Hong Kong. Otherwise, it is too unfair to the soldiers who are fighting bloody battles and the compatriots who are displaced and wandering.</p>
<p>(III) A New Posture for the War of Resistance Education</p>
<p>The overall situation is improving, and education is also being addressed. At this National Education Conference, it was unanimously agreed that the curriculum should be adapted to the needs of wartime. The curriculum standards for all levels have also been reorganized and revised by a committee. Strengthening vocational education and cultivating useful technical talents is an urgent requirement. The Ministry of Education has entrusted various universities to run various specialized training classes, including accounting, statistics, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and other classes. High school graduates are recruited for two years of training and awarded appropriate jobs. Each class has 50 students, and the Ministry of Education subsidizes each class with 1,000 yuan in national currency per month. Twenty classes have already been opened with considerable success. Other regions and schools are also expanding their implementation.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the permanent development of education as the foundation of the country, an important resolution was passed at this conference: the central and local education funds should be increased by at least 10% each year. This is an important key to the rebirth of education.</p>
<p>Students and teachers who have lost their schooling or jobs are being dealt with in Chongqing in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Countless teachers and staff from the war zone have registered and been assigned to work. Currently, there are still 1,500 registered primary and secondary school teachers in Chongqing who are undergoing training, hosted by Tang Xifen, a supervisor and section chief of the Ministry of Education. After graduation, they will be assigned to various places to promote wartime compulsory education.</p>
<p>——We very much hope that the responsible authorities in various provinces and regions will earnestly implement the regulations promulgated by the central government, especially arranging for teachers and students properly.</p>
<p>In a private conversation between Minister Chen of Education and Principal Chen, there was a passage that deserves special attention from all schools:</p>
<p>"In addition to following the highest principles of the Three People's Principles education, each school at all levels of education should have its own characteristics. Whether it is literature, science, agriculture, engineering, commerce, medicine, or... each can develop its own specialties based on its school history and existing foundation. As for each student, they should be satisfied according to their family background, whether it is urban, rural, overseas Chinese, military..." "Students should be quiet, active, literary, martial... so that their personality can be developed normally." This is a very correct educational ideal; however, what specific measures can be taken to promote its realization? Principal Chen replied to the reporter: "For individual guidance to students, it is necessary to make good use of the mentor system." From this, we can once again see the importance of "sound faculty" in education.</p>
<p>(IV) A New Map</p>
<p>In Chongqing, there are many progressive publications. Principal Chen brought back this time the "Overall Situation Map of the Enemy and Us" compiled by the Political Department of the Military Commission, which is especially worthy of attention. In it, the areas occupied by × people are marked with dots without concealing their illness. There are also "Our Areas Where We Can Exercise Sovereignty" and "Our Complete Areas," which make it clear that the areas occupied by × people are not easy to become "lines"; the "points" that are temporarily lost are still countable. In the vast territory, for twenty months, many, many parts are still safe and sound. After looking at this map, it suddenly dawned on me that it is absolutely possible for our guerrillas and regular troops to attack the front and rear of the × people. And imagine how dangerous the fate of × people will be in the future! The reporter gladly borrowed the electrotype from Principal Chen, using real evidence to warn the general pessimistic defeatists. Unfortunately, the map is too large and very detailed. When making an electrotype, it must be very blurry, so the original plan to abandon it is a great pity! I heard that Principal Chen plans to submit it to the central government for approval to reprint it, and the reporter wishes him to realize this wish as soon as possible.</p>
<p>One piece of news that needs to be reported in passing is that Principal Chen and others are scheduled to invite principals of secondary schools in Hong Kong this Sunday to report on the experience of attending this meeting. The details of the education aspect in this article will be reported systematically next time.</p>

<h3>My Troops and the Enemy in the Dongjiang Area Are in a Tense Standoff × Suddenly Invade Boluo Lianhe × Loot and Burn Lianhe Before Retreating Immediately My Guerrilla Forces in the Dongjiang Area Have Increased Several Times Compared to Before</h3>
<p>[Huiyang Express News] My counter-offensive military forces in the Eastern Route, after months of planning and deployment, have become increasingly strong. Since the enemy troops have increased their troops in Zengcheng Shilong Shili and other areas in the past ten days, they are also waiting for the opportunity to invade us. The situation of the current tense standoff between my troops and the enemy in the Dongjiang area is reported below based on information obtained by a certain military agency here:</p>
<p>Hundreds of Enemy Troops Suddenly Invade Boluo</p>
<p>It has been found that Longhua, Futian, Changning, and Lianhe, which are subordinate to Boluo County, are adjacent to Zengcheng, and the enemy troops often invade and harass them. On the 9th of last month, the enemy troops in Zengcheng Shilong, with more than 1,000 infantry and cavalry, invaded Longhua on a large scale in two routes, but were repelled by our troops. After that, the enemy also sent small numbers of troops to harass them from time to time, but they all failed. On the morning of the 15th, more than 400 enemy infantry and cavalry, accompanied by two artillery pieces, suddenly invaded Lianhe. At that time, the troops of the 3rd and ×th Guerrilla Brigades of Lin Junsheng, who were stationed there, joined forces with a certain unit of the defense forces to fight back. After a fierce battle of about two hours, the enemy used its superior artillery fire to bombard us fiercely. Our troops were forced to retreat temporarily due to the destruction of the positions, waiting for reinforcements to counterattack. After the enemy invaded Lianhe, they looted wantonly and set fire to the shops before retreating at noon. Before leaving, they also looted dozens of head of cattle. Before long, our reinforcements arrived, but the enemy had already retreated. In this battle, the enemy suffered dozens of casualties due to our resistance. Now Lianhe has been recaptured by our troops, and there is no trace of the enemy nearby.</p>
<p>Strengthen the Guerrilla Forces in the Dongjiang Area</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the guerrilla strength in the Eastern Route, to carry out extensive guerrilla warfare to annihilate and trap the enemy, and to facilitate our army's large-scale counter-offensive, Zhang Fakui, the commander of the Fourth War Area, summoned Luo Changxiang, the commander of the Third War Area Guerrilla Force, and Wang Ruozhou, the commander of the Fourth War Area, to a certain place in the North River to give them face-to-face instructions on various matters. According to continued news, Commander Zhang also ordered Zhang Ying's special service brigade of the Chao, Hui, and Hui prefectures of the Guangdong Pacification Office to develop the Huibo front line and be under the command of Luo Fengxiang, the commander of the Third Guerrilla Force. At the same time, the Huang and Yang units of the former Daya Bay Garrison Camp were also placed under the command of Commander Luo. Commander Luo then reorganized the two units into the Second and Third Independent Brigades and stationed them in the Luofu Mountain area. The guerrilla strength in the Dongjiang area has been strengthened several times compared to before.</p>
<p>Capture the Chairman of the Shilong Maintenance Association</p>
<p>According to Shenzhen Express News, the enemy troops entrenched in Shilong Wancheng have recently sent troops along the Guangjiu Railway and Wanzhang Highway to invade Chashan, Hengli, Liaobu, and other places. In order to strengthen the defense of the Guangjiu Railway, the Fourth War Area Guerrilla Headquarters ordered the Jin Kun unit of the Fourth Detachment to move to the Zhangmutou area to be on alert to prevent the enemy troops from advancing further. Luo's unit obeyed the order and arrived at the destination yesterday (20th) to deploy and be on guard. It was also found that the enemy troops in the Dongjiang area had recently instigated a large number of traitors to infiltrate various counties in Dongbin and Huibo to gather military intelligence and induce various villages to establish puppet organizations. Lun Zhonglian, the former chairman of the puppet maintenance association in Shilong, secretly arrived in Tangtouxia, with ulterior motives. The matter was detected by the intelligence team of the Jin Kun unit, and Lun was captured in a certain shop in Tangtouxia yesterday afternoon and taken back to the Fourth War Area Guerrilla Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Rongqi Remains Tense The Enemy Invades Shatou from Daliang My Strength in Rongqi is Strong Gu Dinghua Investigates Senior Officers Who Retreat Without Authorization</h3>
<p>[Rongqi Express News] After Daliang fell to the enemy again and the teams retreated to Rongqi, the situation became tense. At the same time, the enemy deployed fortifications around the county seat of Daliang, and established puppet organizations. Traitors Liang Tianlu was appointed as the puppet county magistrate, and Liang Yongxin was appointed as the puppet police chief. Absurd announcements were issued to lure county residents back to the county to work. On the one hand, traitors were recruited to attract unscrupulous businessmen to operate gambling and opium dens. All of these are clear evidence of the intention to occupy the area for a long time. Rongqi and Daliang are very close to each other. The situation of the enemy and us in the two places can be known as follows:</p>
<p>The Enemy Occupies the Sugar Factory and Engages in Fierce Battles Across the River</p>
<p>It was found that the Rongqi section of the Zhongshun Highway (formerly known as the Rongliang Highway, which was a mistake) runs from Daliang to Shatou, but cannot directly reach Rongqi because Shatou and Rongqi are separated by a narrow strip of water. When our teams withdrew from Daliang, they crossed the river to Rongqi because there was no defense along the Rongliang Road. Fortunately, the 5th Detachment of Yuan Dai's 1st Mobile Brigade of the 1st Guerrilla Area was stationed in Rongqi, and the enemy could not advance further. However, the enemy sent troops from Daliang to station in Shatou across the sea on the 17th of this month, and remotely controlled Rongqi from the Shatou Sugar Factory. Although the enemy in Daliang has not launched an invasion, the situation in Rongqi has not eased slightly. On the 17th, the enemy once fired small cannons and machine guns at Rongqi across the river, and our troops fought back, exchanging fire for more than ten minutes before stopping. On the 18th, they bombarded again, and we guarded our positions strictly to prevent them from crossing the river. As of the 19th, the enemy had no intention of approaching further.</p>
<p>Teams Strengthen Defenses and Thoroughly Investigate Dereliction of Duty</p>
<p>Currently, the teams concentrated in Rongqi, in addition to those who withdrew from Daliang, Yuan Dai, the commander of the First Mobile Brigade, had already transferred a large team from Xiaolan, led by Chief of Staff Qu Renzhe, to Rongqi to strengthen the defenses. On the 19th of this month, Commander Yuan personally led the team from Xiaolan to garrison Rongqi. The other teams in Shun also arrived one after another, with strong strength. They can attack or defend, and there is no need to worry about defense. In addition to commanding the defense, Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the First War Area, also began to investigate whether the commanding officers of the teams in charge when Daliang fell had retreated without authorization, resulting in a lack of leadership of the troops and the inability to fully exert their resistance. He will report to his superiors and thoroughly investigate the dereliction of duty. It is said that Vice Commander Lu Ling took the self-provided steamship "Youde" to a certain place on the night of the fall of Daliang and has not yet returned to the team.</p>
<p>Rongqi Imposes Martial Law and the Ferries Are Packed</p>
<p>Martial law has been declared in Rongqi, and the public security is very good. Because the enemy troops are only a river away, the teams strictly prohibit boats from berthing on the shore. However, the Xinheli Ferry from Shiqi to Rongqi and the Xingji Ferry from Jiangmen to Rongqi are allowed to operate as usual due to transportation reasons. However, each ferry must be moored halfway overnight when returning to Rongqi at night, and then sail to Rongqi to unload passengers and goods in the morning. The people in Rongqi, Guizhou, and nearby villages are automatically evacuated, and many go to Zhongshan and Xinhui temporarily. The ferries departing from Rongqi have been extremely crowded with passengers in recent days.</p>
<h3>After the Fall of Daliang, the Siyi Strengthen Their Defense Forces Adjustments are Made to Finance, Transportation, Food, and Other Items The Central Government Approves the Exemption of Rice Tax for 10,000 Bags per County</h3>
<p>[Jiangmen Express News] Since the fall of Guangdong [Jiangmen Express News], the situation in Siyi has changed. The enemy troops have occupied Jiujiang Heqing, and recently captured Shunde Tianliang. They have repeatedly attempted to invade Siyi. Now Siyi has stepped up the mobilization of the people, and Li Wuzi, the commander of the Fifth War Area Column, has increased the number of guerrilla teams to strengthen the defense forces of Siyi. The important progress of the wartime finance, transportation, and food in Siyi recently is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organize Finance and Prohibit Discounts on National Currency</p>
<p>Currently, the ratio of national currency to fractional currency in Taishan, Kaiping, Xinhui, and Enping counties has long been set by the Ministry of Finance at 1:44. However, since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of people in Siyi has increased sharply. At the same time, the circulation of national currency in Siyi has become more prosperous. Most shops have switched to using national currency as the standard, but some unscrupulous merchants have secretly discounted the national currency, especially discriminating against Farmers Bank banknotes, which should be strictly prohibited to maintain wartime finance. The counties have issued announcements prohibiting this. If it is found that the national currency is being discounted in the future, the crime will be treated as treason.</p>
<p>The Water and Land Transportation Situation in Various Counties</p>
<p>After Daliang in Shunde was attacked and occupied by the enemy again, the situation in Jiangmen also became tense. After the Daxingye and Lihe electric ferries sailing between Sanbu and Macau were robbed in Luzhou, the water and land transportation in Siyi was even more affected. In order to regulate the wartime transportation in Siyi, the Fifth War Area Column Headquarters established a wartime shipping cooperative to organize the water transportation in Siyi. After the ferry from Jiangmen to Rongqi was suspended a few days ago, it has now resumed operation. The other ferries from Jiangmen to Sanbu and from Sanbu to Macau are operating as usual. The roads in the counties of Siyi have been thoroughly destroyed due to the recent tense situation, and the work has been unusually busy in recent days.</p>
<p>Tax-Exempt Foreign Rice is Imported in a Steady Stream</p>
<p>The price of rice in Siyi has soared, affecting the people's food. A few days ago, Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the First War Area, convened a meeting of county magistrates and decided on measures to relieve the food situation in the counties, and requested the central government to approve the exemption of foreign rice tax. Now the central government has approved the exemption of import tax for 10,000 bags of foreign rice per county in the First War Area. Now the chambers of commerce of Xinhui, Kaiping, Taishan, and Enping counties have convened rice merchants to discuss the import of foreign rice. Therefore, tax-exempt foreign rice in Siyi has been steadily imported in recent days, and the price of rice has gradually declined.</p>
<h3>The Rice Shortage in Xijiang is Resolved Guizhou Rice Relaxes Export Ban Strictly Investigate Traitor Smuggling The Price of Rice May Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Express News] Recently, due to the transition between the old and new crops in Xijiang, and the enemy troops instigating traitors to smuggle exports and good merchants taking the opportunity to manipulate, the price of grain has skyrocketed. Medium-grade rice costs about six catties per yuan, and lower-grade rice costs only six and a half catties. The poor people are crying out in pain, and the social food order is also affected. Li Leifu, the administrative commissioner of the Third War Area, in order to find a way to relieve the situation, in addition to actively encouraging increased production and strictly investigating traitor smuggling, also submitted a request to the provincial government to consult with the Guizhou provincial authorities to relax the ban on rice exports in order to adjust the situation. Chairman Li is concerned about the people's livelihoods, and has approved it. The Guizhou provincial authorities also believe that Guangdong and Guizhou are closely related, and that food should be mutually adjusted and supplied during the war of resistance. They have ordered Wuzhou and other places to allow the export of grain and rice. Now the county governments and business groups in Xijiang have sent people to Guizhou to purchase in order to solve this serious food problem. It is expected that a large number of yesterday's rice will be on the market in the daytime, and the price of rice may gradually decline.</p>
<h3>A Certain Military Officer Talks About My Counter-Offensive in Guangzhou With Great Confidence My Newly Equipped Army and Air Force Strength is Enough to Control the Enemy The Enemy Wants to Take Advantage of My Undecided Deployment to Shake My People's Hearts</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express News] The news of my army's counter-offensive in Guangzhou has been circulating in newspapers for a long time. Yesterday, a reporter visited a certain military officer and asked about the recent deployment of the military for the counter-offensive in Guangzhou. He gave the following detailed account: (1) Since the central military authorities sent personnel to the south for the military of the counter-offensive in Guangzhou, several emergency military meetings have been held in a certain place in northern Guangdong, and a high-level general meeting has been held in a certain place in Guilin. However, the reason why it has not become a reality immediately is that the deployment of each line takes time. The enemy and traitors are using this opportunity to spread rumors to all parties, saying that my army in Guangzhou is no longer able to recover it, hoping to shake my army's and people's belief in the war of resistance. However, they do not know that the three lines in the east, west, and north have gathered hundreds of thousands of troops, all equipped with the latest weapons, whose quality and quantity can be compared with those of the enemy, and are sufficient to control them. (2) My military officers have been ordered to go to the front line to take charge of the command of each route. Each officer is a famous general with both wisdom and courage, who has fought with the enemy again and again, winning victory after victory. The soldiers of each division and regiment have also been replenished and adjusted, and their strength has increased more than twenty times compared to before. (3) My army and air force, which have been ordered to participate in the counter-offensive in Guangzhou, have newly transferred more than a dozen air force teams to the air force and assigned them to certain airfields in a certain line. There are also more than a dozen special squadrons of heavy bomber aircraft. In terms of the army, five major teams of tanks, one major team of amphibious vehicles, and more than a dozen squadrons of the most elite mechanized units have been newly transferred to Guangdong. (4) The entire plan for my counter-offensive in Guangzhou has been issued by the supreme commander to a certain military commander. After another high-level officer meeting, the various steps of the counter-offensive can be distributed. Therefore, there is great confidence in the counter-offensive in Guangzhou in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>The Investigation of the Disaster Situation in Haikang Under the Wild Bombing of Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>(Haikang Express News) Haikang County has been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft in the past month. On the 11th and 12th of this month, it was bombed again by enemy aircraft, causing a terrible disaster. The situation of the losses is recorded below. According to statistics, enemy aircraft dropped more than 20 bombs in two days. One bomb landed outside the city in the back of Xiheli Observation Station, hitting the Tieyuan Ironworks. In the city, one incendiary bomb landed on Guangchao South Road, opposite the Leiyang Printing House in the back alley of Wang Yan's house. A fire broke out immediately and burned four houses in a row. The front seat of the Ailian Pavilion opposite the house was destroyed by the shock, and a section of the outer wall of the Shitou Pavilion on the right was collapsed.

<h3>The Internal Strife in Guangdong Between the Enemy is Becoming More Intense Enemy Army and Navy Almost Clashed</h3>
<p>Enemy Marines Were Prevented from Landing The Enemy Navy Will Not Provide Transportation</p>
<p>[Macau Express News] The internal strife between the army and navy of the enemy troops entering Guangdong has been brewing for a long time. At first, it was to compete for credit, and then they restrained each other. A few days ago, the enemy army wanted to open the Pearl River waterway to restore the prosperity of the urban area, but the enemy navy insisted on not allowing it, and made things difficult and intimidated all incoming ships in every possible way, trying to block the traffic. Therefore, the enemy army was deeply regretful. On the 14th of this month, an enemy warship, fully loaded with about 500 marines, stopped at Bai Goose Pond and landed to parade, scattering in various military canteens, shouting and yelling. As a rule, the enemy troops often hide in the camp at night, fearing the attack of our guerrillas, and dare not go out. That night, the enemy marines did not return to the warship after the time had passed, and the enemy military police sent many people to disperse them. The next day, the commander of the enemy warship actually landed to meet the military officer of the enemy army, requesting to find a place to station, but the Guangzhou enemy chief refused and did not allow them to land. As a result, the soldiers of the enemy warship made a great noise. The enemy army on land, fearing an incident, immediately sent a large team carrying many light machine guns to deploy along the embankment to prevent the enemy soldiers from approaching the shore. For a time, pedestrians were cut off and the situation was very serious. Later, people from the enemy special service team were sent to mediate, and it was agreed that the enemy officers from the army and navy would meet at the Aiqun Hotel. As a result, the two sides insisted on their own opinions and each sent a telegram back to their country to report and wait for a solution. At the meeting, the enemy navy stated that before the incident was resolved, it would not be responsible for transportation and relief, in order to restrain the enemy army on land. Its internal split has become increasingly acute.</p>

<p>Movies and Dramas</p>
<h3>The Film City's Widows</h3>
<p>Hollywood is a place filled with countless "tearless widows" and "merry widows," who truly deserve these names. They pass their days singing, dancing, or knitting, just like their husbands who only care about pursuing their passions and neglect their wives.</p>
<p>They often begin their widowhood after their honeymoon. This life can last from one to ten years, or even longer. The length of time is determined only by themselves.</p>
<p>Who are these people? This doesn't just refer to the wives of male stars. Many are famous actresses of the time, like Claudette Colbert and Irene Dunne, who became widows due to their husbands' professions. Bette Davis became a "golf widow" immediately after her marriage. Every Sunday, when she was bored alone, she would swing a club and go to the golf course to stretch her muscles. There are countless widows like this.</p>
<p>Here, we must first understand the term "widow." Hollywood widows seem to belong to the same category as Indian widows who commit sati (Suttee). Indian customs believe that after a husband dies, he goes to another bright and happy world, so women commit self-immolation to go with him to paradise. Isn't the motivation extremely similar between the two? Looking up the dictionary, the strict definition of a widow should be "a wife left behind after her husband dies." However, we don't need to be too strict. Although their husbands have not died, they cannot be with them day and night, so they are left alone in their empty rooms. It is not an exaggeration to call them widows.</p>
<p>Opera star Bing Crosby spends all day at the golf course. Sometimes, even on the premiere day of his new film, he can't put down his golf club. If the company needs to find him, they just go to the golf association, and they can always find him. But his wife suffers and cannot go with him. This is one aspect. At the same time, he is also a horse racing fanatic, completely absorbed in it. Fortunately, his wife is virtuous, knitting and raising their children to pass the time. She holds two positions: "horse racing widow" and "golf widow."</p>
<p>James Cagney and Dick Powell have their own unique hobby, which they call "yachting." However, their wives don't go with them. Every time they happily set off, two short-lived widows are added to the film city. They stay at home, take care of the children, manage the household, and play with their dogs when they have free time.</p>
<p>Lee S. Howard's wife would rather be a widow than go on photography trips with her husband. She said it well, "I can't run around with him everywhere, climbing steep mountains to photograph sea geese like him. I absolutely can't do it. Rather than break my bones and become an amateur photography expert, I'd rather be a widow at home." Similarly, Basil Rathbone's wife feels the same way. These are two "camera widows."</p>
<p>Paul Muni has a habit of deep thinking. When an important role is assigned to him, he spends two to four hours a day for one or two weeks, pondering and studying the character's personality. During this time, his wife is left aside. Paul does very deep research on every role. For roles like Emile Zola, he reads various reference books, and his wife accompanies him closely, even going to the film set. However, when he is immersed in thought, although his body is by his wife's side, his soul has already left this world and flown to Zola's world. Mrs. Paul Muni cannot follow him there.</p>
<p>Hedy Lamarr is also a widow, an arms widow. She said that in her previous days, all she heard was "arms, arms," nothing else, which made her disgusted. She finally escaped from that bejeweled "narrow cage" to find another life in the wider society.</p>
<p>When Roger Pryor and his band go on tour, Ann Sothern is also a widow. Similarly, when Dorothy Lamour's husband goes on tour with his band, Dorothy stays at home, at the film set, at the radio station, and sometimes at the Coconut Grove, listening to Rudy Vallée's music with her friends or her husband's friends. These two can be considered representatives of the many "band widows" in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Bette Davis also had a period as a "band widow," but later she traveled around with her husband. Eventually, her husband left that life, and she also moved away from that widow's life. However, recently, they are about to separate again.</p>
<p>Errol Flynn's wife, Lili Damita, also lives a solitary life for most of the days due to her husband's wandering nature. Moreover, Errol Flynn doesn't just wander a little; he wanders thousands of miles, across the vast ocean, tirelessly, never thinking of returning home. This time he has been missing for more than three weeks. We hope he is on a happy journey, but his absurd character of only caring about wandering and not caring about his wife is a bit uncomplimentary.</p>
<p>Gene Hersholt is a bookworm. As soon as a new book is published, he must read it. At the same time, he likes to study the Bible. This makes his wife a "book widow."</p>
<p>There are many "political widows." Mrs. Melvyn Douglas, Mrs. Robert Montgomery, Mrs. Edward Arnold, and Mrs. Edward G. Robinson all belong to this category.</p>
<p>The clever Mrs. Pat O'Brien salvaged part of her widow's life. Pat O'Brien also likes to watch horse races and often spends time with his comrades Ralph Bellamy, James Cagney, and Frank McHugh. To remedy this, she moved her house to Del Mar, which is connected to the racecourse. This way, when he goes to the racecourse, she can also participate. Or even if she doesn't go, being so close, jokingly speaking, as long as she rings the bell, Pat can hear it and know that it's time to come back for dinner.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy is a "producer's widow," and Ilka Chase is a "scriptwriter's widow." Their widowhood occurs when their husbands are focused on their work and have no time to care for "her."</p>
<p>Actresses who marry people outside the film industry, such as Claudette Colbert and Irene Dunne, both have husbands who are doctors. When Claudette's husband goes out to dinner with her, he disappears as soon as ten o'clock strikes, like a ghost. He has good reasons to excuse himself, such as "I must go to the hospital" or "I have some work to do." Claudette's widowhood is completely tied to the health of the social elite. Irene Dunne's husband, a dentist, is even further away in New York. He is a dedicated person, so she has to spend more days embracing her lonely quilt. There is often a distance of three thousand miles between the couple, thus creating Irene Dunne's reputation as a "long-distance widow." Mita Leon Garfield is also one of them.</p>
<p>Fred Astaire is often diligent in practicing dance, neglecting his wife. Spencer Tracy, Louis Stone, and Robert Montgomery often stay in the film set. They are all businessman-like stars, treating the film set like an office, staying there all day. Even a businessman's wife would visit her husband's office once or twice a year, but these three wives never do that. While their husbands are working, they just stay at home and read film news in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>At the same time, Robert Montgomery and Spencer Tracy love polo, Colman and Lee love tennis, Don Ameche loves broadcasting, Dick Foran loves playing poker, and Rock and Chester Morris love magic. These are all reasons for wives to become widows.</p>
<p>Remember Edgar Bergen. Although he is not yet married, we dare to assert that his future wife will definitely be a widow. At least, her chances of sitting on his lap will be much less than Charlie McCarthy's—that little wooden man.</p>
<p>But if Clark Gable and Carole Lombard get married—the possibility of this happening is now greater—Lombard will never be a widow. Their interests are exactly the same. Clark will never go duck hunting alone without Carole.</p>

<h3>Internal Decision by the General Association on the 16-Man Squad for the Macau-Hong Kong Interport Football Match, Canceling the Previous Proposal to Select Young Players Entirely</h3>
<p>This 16-man squad is an internal decision and still needs to be reviewed at a meeting before a final decision is made.</p>
<p>[Our reporter's exclusive report] The Hong Kong-Macau Interport Football Match was initiated in the year before last, and the victory in both previous editions belonged to the Macau team. This was because in those two editions, the Hong Kong General Association fulfilled the request of the Macau General Association and completely selected Group B players as representatives, leading to two defeats by the Macau team.</p>
<p>This year, the tournament is held in Macau on rotation, and the match date is set for April 16. Yesterday, the Hong Kong General Association received a letter from the Macau General Association, stating that they were very pleased that the Hong Kong General Association had accepted their request to select Group A players as representatives this time and invited the Hong Kong team to come on schedule.</p>
<p>The Management Subcommittee responsible for selecting the Hong Kong team representatives has held several meetings to discuss the selection of personnel. Initially, the intention was to completely select young players as representatives, giving them an opportunity to compete abroad and gain experience. This proposal has been reported in previous newspapers. Later, the Management Subcommittee members believed that since the Macau General Association had requested the Hong Kong team to select Group A players to participate, it could be expected that the Macau team's strength would not be weak. If capable players were not carefully selected to fight, they were afraid of repeating the failures of the previous two times. Therefore, they canceled the previous proposal to completely select young players and internally decided on 16 strong players as intended representatives. However, this internal decision should not be regarded as a fact. Whether there will be changes in the future still needs to be reviewed at a meeting before a final decision is made. The list of intended representatives is as follows: (Football Field Tai Sui)</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai (South China South) Deng Qin (Scotch Team)</p>
<p>Wu Liefa (Kowloon Club) Bi Liban (Police Club) Mai Shaohan (South China South)</p>
<p>Li Guowei (South China South) Xu Jingcheng (Oriental Club) Bi Ludo (St. Joseph's) Bi Lidi (Middlesex) Han Nibo Lu (Kowloon Club)</p>
<p>Liao Yachen (Kowloon Club) Jin Shi (St. Joseph's) Chen Dehui (South China South) Zuo Zhi (Kowloon Club) Yang Shuiyi (South China South) Deng Guangsen (South China South)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Lido Plans to Come South for Competition</h3>
<p>[Our reporter's exclusive report] The Shanghai Paramount Ballroom basketball team has gathered many talented players and has a high reputation. It is currently the most popular strong team in the "isolated island." A few months ago, the Hong Kong Star team sent a letter inviting the team to come to Hong Kong for competition at the end of April. According to the team's reply, they agreed. Next opportunity, the team considered going to the Philippines, but there were no concrete plans.</p>
<p>According to news, it has not been decided whether the Paramount Ballroom basketball team will come for real. However, the Lido football team wants to come south for competition at the end of April. At that time, Hong Kong's football season will have ended. If the team comes, it will be a great thing.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Tennis Singles Match: The Lin Brothers Show Their Heroism, and There Will Be Four More Singles Matches Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament, the singles match between Da Linzhen and Cai Yongshan, attracted many spectators. The surroundings of the court were packed, making it the most enthusiastic match since the start of the singles tournament this year. Cai is a rising star, young and strong. Before the match, many said that this person would pose a great threat to Da Linzhen. Sure enough, Cai showed amazing performance in the first set. An old player like Da Linzhen felt it was difficult to deal with. Cai's serve was also solid, and his volley and drop shot were also quite accomplished. Unfortunately, he lacked experience, and mistakes were frequent, especially his baseline shots, which often went out of bounds, leading to his failure. On the other hand, Da Linzhen dared not underestimate his opponent, step by step, and his shots were cautious, and his landing points were appropriate. So he won with 7-5, 6-4. In the match between Huang Zhaorong and Ma Huiguang, Ma was no match. Huang won two sets in a row with 6-2, 6-3. The match was not very exciting. In the third singles match, Xiao Linzhen faced Guo Qingsen. Guo struggled hard in the preliminary round, making it difficult for Xiao Linzhen to win. Unfortunately, after Guo failed with 5-7 in the first set, he became dispirited and lost the second set with 6-3 and was eliminated.</p>

<h3>Today's Football: South China South Will Play</h3>
<p>(Our reporter's exclusive report) Recently, the football battles have evolved into a big mess, making the football fans laugh and cry. It is still unknown who will win the great trophy. However, according to the current situation, South China South still has the highest hope.</p>
<p>At 5 pm today, South China South will play against St. Joseph's at Jia Shan. In theory, South China South will win, but it still depends on whether the players maintain their normal state. Because we are concerned that South China South lost to the Police team last week, we are a bit worried. If South China South fails again, the situation will be dire.</p>
<p>In this final stage of the trophy competition, the South China South players must not be negligent and must move forward. If they win against Joseph today and beat the Kowloon Club on Saturday, then they are guaranteed to win the championship. Work hard, the glittering trophy is waiting for you to embrace it!</p>
<p>The ticket price for this match has been reduced, with covered stands costing four corners and open-air stands costing two corners. With such a low price, you may want to give it a try. The lineups for the two teams are as follows: (Dong Lang)</p>

<h3>The Organization of German Sports Institutions</h3>
<p>Today's German authorities, especially the head of state and prime minister Hitler, attach great importance to sports for the development of social health and education. In order to train the national physique, it is necessary to rectify everything from the national level as a prerequisite. Looking at the 1936 Olympic Games held in Berlin, the foresight of the personnel in charge, the practicality of the work, and the efficiency of the organization can be seen. They began to implement the development of German sports work in 1933, and their achievements were no different from the Olympic Games. The effectiveness of the work in the past six years has not only enabled today's German sports undertakings to improve compared with the past, but also has profound significance and system for the construction of sports.</p>
<p>After the German National Socialist Party took power, it was committed to developing sports, and it was obvious that there was a need for thorough reform. At that time, almost every sports training department had countless institutions and organizations, the situation was complicated, the system was difficult to distinguish, and some often argued with each other due to private opinions, and the work was completely without spirit and very scattered. Later, all members freely voted to establish the National Sports Training Committee, headed by a director. The board of directors was the organizer of the 1936 Olympic Games in Germany. However, the committee's progress on various organizational tasks was often stalled, because at that time, the sports faction and the gymnastics faction not only had no sincerity to cooperate, but also became more emotional, so disputes often arose in the conference hall.</p>
<p>In 1933, Schmidt, who was appointed as the sports commissioner and has now been promoted to the national sports leader, took office and immediately took the abolition of the above-mentioned disputes and the unification of various sports institutions as the first task, and organized the National Sports Training Association. Today, all sports or gymnastics organizations in Germany are under the command of the association. Because of the different types of sports training, specialized departments were established, and sports institutions were established in various places in accordance with national organizational regulations to facilitate contact, so that sports undertakings can be concentrated under a single command to facilitate the conduct, which is the performance of the 1936 Olympic Games. The finances of sports undertakings are also properly managed, either by providing subsidies or by ordering savings, such as using the income from football matches to build a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Since the head of state and prime minister issued an order on December 21, 1938, all German sports institutions have been directly under the protection and command of the National Socialist Party. The significance is not that the National Sports Training Association has abandoned its sports work and become a purely political sports association. The explanation of this point can be seen from the association's achievements in sports and the country. There are two games in Group B.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Men's Basketball, Group A Suspended, and There Will Be Two Games in Group B</h3>

In terms of the strength of the Group B teams, the first game is evenly matched, and it is impossible to predict who will win.

<h3>Local Stock Market: Situation is Unusually Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's stock market situation in Hong Kong was extremely quiet, likely due to the impact of lower stock prices in the London stock market.

<h3>Hong Kong Inter-Port Team Going to the Philippines: To Play Singapore Chinese on April 2nd for Practice</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter's Exclusive] The Hong Kong inter-port football team, scheduled to depart for the Philippines on April 18th, has already had its 15 members selected by the General Association. Except for Ken Yin, Lie Li, and the later replacement Parkar, who all claimed they could not go due to other commitments, all others have replied to the Association, stating that they can go. Furthermore, the General Association plans to hold one or two practice matches before the Hong Kong inter-port team departs, so that each representative can understand the collaborative effort. However, given the current tense football season, it is difficult to find free time to hold these matches. Therefore, it has been decided that during the second match when the Singapore Chinese team comes to Hong Kong (April 2nd), this inter-port team will use the name of the Hong Kong United team to play against the Singapore Chinese team. This is truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<h3>The Efficacy of Morning Exercises (II)</h3>
<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>(3) It has the efficacy of correcting the body and mind.</p>
<p>The wall separating the body and mind has been gradually torn down since the 19th century, and monism has also risen to prominence, leading to a major shift in the implementation of physical education. The former view that physical education was only for physical training has also collapsed. Morning exercises are a type of physical training, so they can certainly include both physical and mental training, achieving a corrective effect. Moreover, common people's problems, while sleeping, will inevitably generate many wild ideas, which are useless and may even harm the body and mind. This is especially true when one cannot fall asleep or when waking up. These fantasies will make you unwilling to get out of bed and continue to daydream. If this continues day after day, the crisis for both the body and mind will definitely increase gradually. In the end, your life's work will also be controlled by it, rather than you being in control. Therefore, we must develop the habit of morning exercises to save ourselves from this crisis. Because the air in the early morning is a very clean holy water that can wash away your turbid mind. Therefore, after doing morning exercises every day, you will definitely benefit from improved blood circulation and a clear mind.</p>
<p>(4) It can help digestion and increase appetite.</p>
<p>First, we must understand the relationship between appetite and digestion. Everyone feels that when the stomach is hungry (strong digestive power), the amount of food intake increases significantly, and when the stomach is full (weak digestive power), they don't feel like eating anything. From this, we can derive a theorem: a strong appetite is directly proportional to the strength of digestive power, that is, when digestive power is strong, appetite is strong, and when digestive power is weak, appetite naturally decreases. Based on this definition, if we want a strong appetite, we must improve our digestive function. There are many ways to improve digestive function. In my opinion, adjusting our physical fitness daily is the most fundamental and effective method, especially morning exercise.</p>
<p>Although "morning exercises" are gentle exercises, after completing seven sets, the amount of exercise is already saturated, and the consumption of energy is not small. The human body is like a machine. It produces "ability" only when it has fuel, and it can move only when it has ability. When we are hungry, we always feel weak all over, and we cannot muster any strength. This is because the body lacks fuel and cannot generate heat, resulting in no force. When we exercise, we need a large amount of heat, which disappears in various parts of the body. After the heat is consumed, we need to replenish fuel in order to continue exercising. For the human body, food is the fuel. The more heat is consumed, the greater the amount of food (fuel) required. (Increased food intake) When the waist and abdominal muscles are exercised, they directly help the stomach lining rotate and gastric juices flow, which further enhances the stomach's digestive function. Therefore, morning exercises can indeed help digestion and lead to a strong appetite.</p>
<p>(5) The effect of promoting development.</p>
<p>The general view is that the strength of an individual's physique is directly proportional to the health and strength of their genetic makeup. Although this view is not wrong, it is somewhat biased. The idea of "like father, like son" should not be overemphasized. In fact, in addition to genetic factors, the most important thing is postnatal training. Therefore, a sound physique must have both superior innate heredity and good environmental training. Even if innate heredity is not good, it will not work without postnatal cultivation. However, people with innate deficiencies (with the exception of some deficiencies) can also achieve the hope of sound development through postnatal cultivation and training. "Morning exercises" are the most reliable type of exercise. Young people during the development period who are consistent with this type of exercise can achieve average (complete) development and will not be deformed or localized. Therefore, (morning exercises) are extremely relevant to the development of young people during the development period. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>White Cogongrass Flowers</h3>
<p>— Yuren</p>
<p>A new kind of mountain wilderness, permeated with a hazy mist, coats everything in a thick color of melancholy.</p>
<p>There are nine of us altogether, silently advancing along the muddy road. Work drives us, and even encourages us, to walk on foot to a place far beyond the clouds and smoke. We, with our bodies dampened by the rain, silently gaze at the remote and scattered villages, our anxious eyes constantly searching along the long journey for the distant destination of this departure.</p>
<p>Gradually, a pile of white houses clearly emerges before our eyes, slowly approaching, approaching. Based on the estimation of the distance of the journey, we know that this is a market with a beautiful name—White Cogongrass Flowers!</p>
<p>Walking into the market town, what meets our eyes is a pile of scattered rubble all over the ground, and broken, scorched house corners. The phenomenon of ten houses, nine empty, flawlessly demonstrates that this is a place that has suffered the calamity of war!</p>
<p>Loneliness, loneliness! Only a few villagers set up stalls selling pastries by the roadside, only a few yellow dogs linger and hesitate in the streets, only a symphonic orchestra of two is playing an elegy for the market town's tragic encounter!</p>
<p>We walked straight from the west of the market to the east of the market, like a team of explorers stepping into a desolate ancient city!</p>
<p>When we reached the outskirts of the market, we couldn't help but wander around the ruins that had been burned and looted by the [Japanese] soldiers. Probably because no one had excavated and cleaned up after the looting, the ground still broadcast a burst of the smell of rotting corpses. If we hadn't remembered that this was a market town after the disaster, we might have been aware that it was a quiet wasteland!</p>
<p>On the rubble, in the distance, a yellow dog was chewing on "something white. Curiosity drove me to approach and take a look. Ah! That turned out to be a human skull, a yellowish-white skull with flesh. I saw those cavernous eyes, cavernous nose, and cavernous mouth! Although there was no expression on the flesh, I keenly felt the infinite grief, anger, and sorrow hidden on that fixed, ferocious skull. I gently took it in my hand for detailed observation, and the rotten flesh that had not been completely eroded emitted a strong, pungent odor!</p>
<p>The villagers told me: The original body of that skull was one of the vagrants who came to White Cogongrass Flowers with great difficulty. He sacrificed his life under the enemy's brutal massacre when the war broke out last winter. The passage of time has eroded the flesh of the dead. Now, only a broken head and a few broken bones are left on this rubble!</p>
<p>What a bewildering story! What a painful and evocative relic on the ruins! When I closed my eyes and used my imagination to construct the situation under the trampling of the enemy's iron hooves, an atmosphere of terror and hatred tightly wrapped around my chest!</p>
<p>The villagers said that skulls are common here, because most places have not been cleaned and removed. Therefore, the entire White Cogongrass Flowers is constantly shrouded in the stench of corpses. On the other hand, because the residents of the market have all fled, the scenery on the market is even more desolate!</p>
<p>The rain was a little lighter. We stopped for a moment and continued eastward.</p>
<p>Ah! White Cogongrass Flowers! White Cogongrass Flowers in the stench of corpses, White Cogongrass Flowers in loneliness, White Cogongrass Flowers everywhere with broken tiles and broken walls! The residual scene after your disaster is forever etched in our hearts. We will never forget you, and the millions of compatriots in the East River will also leave a bloody inscription for you forever! We hope that one day: in the glorious struggle, the concrete made of iron, blood, and flesh will recreate you from scratch! Let the devils brutally and lewdly trample on you like a young woman! Let the enemy destroy you like a toy! Today, millions of hearts are shaking and beating rapidly for your experience, millions of spears and shields are being fiercely tempered for your shame, and millions of people are shaking their shoulders and working hard for your revival!</p>
<p>White Cogongrass Flowers! Let your new life be based on the active national struggle!</p>
<h3>The Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shuqun</p>
<p>The tacit acknowledgement of the other party's sincerity is the most certain answer, not allowing her any doubt or justification. Thus, her former goodwill towards the impression and fantasy of the Volunteer Army has become an unattainable dream of the past. The feeling left in the dream is only regret, because people are unwilling to be violated—especially when it comes to personal intuition, especially for those who value self-esteem too much. She believes that self-esteem is her chastity; even though she is weak, she tolerates coercion and threats.</p>
<p>When he urged her to leave, she wrote:</p>
<p>"Wait a moment."</p>
<p>She looked at her favorite vase, the chrysanthemums in the vase, the piano scores that were often in her hands. Goodbye, this seemed to be the last look.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of the enemy's door knocking rang outside. He was so stimulated that he almost shouted:</p>
<p>"Do you want to trap me? You witch!"</p>
<p>He immediately decided—to shoot the person outside the door. If necessary, there was himself. Leaving her, leaving a necessary job for another comrade. When he learned that it was the maid who came to deliver tea, he took out a handkerchief for her; using a gun to maintain the sanctity of the order, he forced her to say to the outside:</p>
<p>"I don't want tea."</p>
<p>"What about the guest?"</p>
<p>"Gue——st"? He looked at his shaking head and said again: "Gue...st...has...gone..."</p>
<p>"Miss, why is your voice trembling? Are you sick? Let me come in and see!"</p>
<p>He thought:</p>
<p>"It's over!"</p>
<p>At this moment, he possessed a superhuman wisdom, which made his hand close the electric light. Moreover, he gave her a sign with the gun—his terror. At the same time, he had another idea:</p>
<p>"If she is braver, what use is my gun?"</p>
<p>He also thought about running away at this opportunity, wouldn't it also be up to her?"</p>
<p>However, she was trembling extremely. If he didn't hold her clothes, she might fall down immediately.</p>
<p>A crack opened in the door, and a strand of light from the hallway, along with an incomplete head shadow, fell on the dark floor. The maid's voice:</p>
<p>"Miss, are you asleep?"</p>
<p>"Not...yet..."</p>
<p>"You must be sick. Your voice has changed!"</p>
<p>"No——"</p>
<p>"Then have you been there."</p>
<p>"You know everything——"</p>

<h3>On Surrender Eight-legged Essays</h3>
<p>— Jing Chunfeng</p>
<p>In the inaugural issue of Shanghai's *Cosmos* magazine, there is an article by Ba Jin titled "Formalists," referring to those who only write official anti-war articles and shout slogans like "The final victory will surely belong to us," but do not actively participate in the war. Although such articles do not explicitly criticize the traitors who advocate peace talks, those who are considered decent people should probably put down the book and pass it by. But to our surprise, a certain newspaper in Hong Kong actually took this article and wrote a lengthy "On Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," not only helping the idle to criticize those who write "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," but even fundamentally overturning the case, even opposing the war itself. Their conclusion is a surrender and peace-seeking. Now we can quote a passage:</p>
<p>"We mostly agree with the above article. What is worth considering is "The final victory belongs to the masses..." In fact, if we continue to fight, no one can guarantee this happiness—continuing to fight now will definitely not win the support of the masses. We want victory, we can only strive for it through peaceful struggle. When we have peace, then all the emptiness of anti-war eight-legged essays will naturally disappear. In short, there is only one way. There is only one way to move towards peace."</p>
<p>The absurdity of the content of this article is self-evident. However, just as they were criticizing "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," they themselves fell into the trap of eight-legged formulas, revealing their true form and starting to write surrender eight-legged essays.</p>
<p>If we analyze it according to Ba Jin's formula for anti-war eight-legged essays, we can get the following answers:</p>
<p>The first paragraph, based on the principle that no one can escape death, introduces a set of "No war that cannot be reconciled," explaining that victory requires peace, and defeat also requires peace. Since peace is required regardless of victory or defeat, why not seek peace today? This paragraph first establishes a footnote for the following text, which argues that China must seek peace. The second paragraph explains that after a dozen months of war, China has already failed and lost the support of the people, probably with the words of the filthy guerrilla teams. The third paragraph discusses the international situation, proving that China will surely be defeated if it continues to resist. At the same time, it presents the Konoe statement and Wang Jingwei's traitorous suggestion declaration, indicating that this is the only way to save China. The descriptive words that praise Wang's enthusiasm for planning the country and his bright and great attitude must be used vigorously in this paragraph. The fourth paragraph scolds the Soviet Union and criticizes the Chinese Communist Party, expressing loyalty to the country and a willingness to sacrifice oneself for the country. At the same time, it laments that the people do not recognize Jing Shan Jade. Furthermore, it maliciously threatens the people, saying: Since Japan treats us so generously, how can we not seek peace with them? If we miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it will be "difficult to fight and difficult to reconcile." The fifth paragraph is that final victory will surely belong to Japan.</p>
<p>This set of eight arguments, with nothing to call it, can only be called surrender eight-legged essays. Compared with "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," there is a very obvious difference. In any case, anti-war eight-legged essays are still the works of Chinese people, while surrender eight-legged essays are Japanese goods. Furthermore, the author of "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays" still has the belief that the war will be won, and advocates for resistance, while the author of "Surrender Eight-legged Essays" fundamentally does not advocate for resistance, does not believe in certain victory, and simply kneels down and shouts surrender. One is a slave, and the other is struggling to survive in the face of death. Between the two, which one is desirable and which one is undesirable will be known without asking the wise.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are still many people who write "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays." If everyone who writes "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays" changes their mind and starts writing "Surrender Eight-legged Essays," China's future would be worrying. It is better to listen to a Chinese person's "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," even just the phrase "The final victory will surely belong to us," than to listen to a Japanese person's words and surrender. What do you, the reader, think?</p>

<p>November 30th, 8:40 PM, I was suddenly stunned to hear that my colleague, Hanabusa, had been killed in action.</p>
<p>It seems that there must be a problem with the Foshan wireless equipment. The situation has been very bad since yesterday. This morning, I heard that "Abe" was repairing the radio. Because it hasn't returned to normal yet, I thought the telephone or dry battery would be delivered. Although that was the case, I could imagine something from Captain Saida; however, no matter how I inquired with the military press department, Lieutenant Sugawara was already on the phone, speaking rapidly. I waited for him to finish, listening to him say, "1 PM? Further in? Right? Is it the right side? - Sigh - From the enemy on the right? Taking heavy fire?" Saying this, it must be information for releasing the battle situation. Looking at Lieutenant Sugawara's hateful face, the messenger on the right put his fingers in his ears and didn't take notes. The conversation seemed quite long, and I thought there would be many difficulties ahead, so I took a piece of paper from the side and started taking notes of Lieutenant Sugawara's fragmented words. When I did this, Lieutenant Sugawara glanced at me and immediately said with hesitation, "Has Hanabusa been killed?" Saying this, he handed me the receiver. "Hanabusa?" I suddenly felt as if dark clouds had covered a clear sky, and I immediately pressed the receiver to my ear. However, I couldn't hear anything. "Hello! Hello!" I asked anxiously, but there was no sound from the other end. Lieutenant Sugawara pointed to the receiver and said, "No, no! Pick up the Suft, pick up the Suft." I hurriedly grabbed the protruding metal fitting and immediately heard Captain Saida's voice... "What's wrong, is there something to finish? Ah! Now Takao will talk to you!" After hearing Takao's voice, I anxiously said, "Has Hanabusa been killed?"... "No... in any case..., it's hopeless, distressing,... it's a distressing matter..." His voice often seemed sad. No matter how I listened, his mind was confused and he couldn't speak coherently. He repeated himself many times, finally clarifying the fact that Hanabusa was dead without a doubt. I returned to where we were gathered, feeling uneasy, perhaps unable to say anything! In the evening, under the lamp, Nakamura and Chiku came. Toki didn't reveal the information that was to be released. When they came in, other than my saying "Hanabusa has been killed," no one else was willing to speak. After a while, everyone had a suffocating look on their faces. Toki walked over here, said "Ugh!" and glared for a moment, then suddenly lay back in the chair and crossed his hands. Toki's face, who had sailed on the ship with Hanabusa, had turned pale. The liaison officers stood as still as statues. I opened the messy and difficult-to-read memorandum, filled with vertical and horizontal writing, on the desk and told everyone. I kept talking, but everyone remained silent. Later, everyone sighed and said: "In any case, it's necessary to report to headquarters..." I looked at my watch, it was already 8:15 PM. There would be radio contact with Taipei at 9 PM, probably to send this message. The simple report to headquarters must be sent out! I picked up a pencil and started writing the draft.

<h3>My Memories</h3>
<p>— Chen Xianwen</p>
<p>In spring, along the murmuring stream, I stroll leisurely down a path shaded by green leaves, to that verdant hillside.</p>
<p>The red azaleas, the bright flowers, are like fire; like the fleeting glimpse of cheeks; and, even more, like the fleeting glimpse of lips.</p>
<p>The cuckoo hides its body in the bushes; but listen, that is a painful sound, it cries out the sorrows of spring!</p>
<p>Spring has the passionate songs of the shepherdesses, which, like the continuous mountain peaks, have intoxicating melodies with ups and downs, are you not moved?</p>
<p>A youthful heart in a youthful atmosphere.</p>
<p>In spring, the birds all build nests in the trees,</p>
<p>In spring, the warm sunshine is on your body, and there is also a warm breeze on your body, how can this gentleness not make your limbs go limp?</p>
<p>Spring gives me a string of tenderness.</p>
<p>Spring gives me a beautiful memory.</p>
<p>Now, spring has come again, and I imagine the road of spring, and it actually has a different mood.</p>
<p>Red azaleas, like blood! The sound of the cuckoo is still sorrowful, but it has a different kind of painful touch.</p>
<p>Songs often come from the mouths of shepherdesses but often stop abruptly, followed by some tragic memories, recalling a transformation of fate, in the clear sky.</p>
<p>The birds are still singing in the trees; the sunshine, the wind, do they not still exist? But, it makes you irritable, it makes you hot, it makes your blood circulate faster.</p>
<p>Because this is a spring in the midst of war!</p>
