<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國聲明與英相演說</h3>
<p>希特勒的冒險行動果然出了一部分世界政治家的意料之外，在分割捷克未及半年的短期間，又以吞併整個捷克的事實驚動了世界，東歐各小國日漸接近虎口，皆不覺岌岌自危。這次希特勒的胃險行動表面上雖似比去年九月間較為平靜，但其危險性却更加深大。與此事件關係最深切的國家，首推英美法，所以這三國對此事件所表示的態度，具着異常的驚駭與警戒。素來信任希特拉最深篤的張伯倫，也已不復十分樂觀了，法國也準備隨英國採强硬態度，美國政府的表示更是具體而有力量。</p>
<p>張伯倫十七日在伯明罕演說中巳有相當的恍悟，認「德國此次之暴行，實為始料所不及」；後悔當日希特勒「諄諄之約言」，「焉知其反復無常有如此之甚者」。這種表示已較日前的裝痴作聾好得多。但今日問題已不在於斤斤的辯明過去的錯誤，正如張氏演說中所言，而是在於如何改弦更張積極玫究制裁侵略者的有効辦法。張氏在這次演說中有兩個要點値得注意；其一是覺察「德國征服異邦的計劃，今已初步進行，或者將來向外更加速侵略」，其二是覺悟「英國必須聯合英帝國內部的力量，又與法國加緊携手，以應付此情勢」。德國侵略異邦固非始自今日，但張氏能言出於衷，挽救歐局的危機尙未為晚。至其應加切實聯結的國家，不應以法國為限，美蘇亦具有重大關係。希特勒今日之東進，也就是明日西進壓迫英法的準備，但是法國國境正如羅斯福總統之言，「卽為美國的第一防綫」，其與美國關係之深切可以想見。德國之東進終必與蘇聯發生直接衝突，蘇聯和英法具有連帶的關係。更重要的一點，是：希特勒的行動確是國際侵略集團的某部分共謀，意大利不久將發動於西歐，日本將更蠢動於遠東，是可以預料的，那末要應付這個侵略集團的在暴，斷非英法二國所能獨當的。此點，張氏及其他英國人士應加以深刻的認識。</p>
<p>因此，對於這次事件認識的澈透和所提議辦法的　實，應推美國政府的聲明與美國明眼人士的提議。</p>
<p>國國務部經總統的同意發表正式聲明，痛斥德國的「險惡小法，實已威脅全世界的和平及現代文化機構」。美國參議員畢特門更在參議院宣稱：「三獨裁國在行動上顯有充分的默契，故對於拉丁美洲所遭遇危機的意見，不應再存嘲笑之心」，實在是一針見血。畢氏還極力主張：「吾人為應付這嚴重局勢及謀吾人自衛起見，對於必要的政治及準備工作，不容遲緩」。德國的侵略對象不只限於歐洲，其與遠東的日本侵略者共謀以侵逼中南美洲，已為美國一般明眼人所熟悉，希特勒侵佔歐洲的計劃若成功到某程度，將必隨其勢力之澎漲而其食指必及於夫洲，所以今日阻止希特勒的狂暴，也卽為美國自己的防衛打算。但其防衛的方法，應該着眼於畢特門所言：「三獨裁國在行動上顯有充分默契」。若作如是觀察，則美國在太平洋上所負責任更為重大，所以美國全國應該促成太平洋上，特別是關島等處的軍事設備。美國能否站穩太平洋的崗位，盡最大的力量，就可以决定民主集團能否在太平洋佔優勢，，而减輕德國帮兇在東方牽制英法。</p>
<p>現在，英國已召囘駐德大使，法國也採同樣動作，德國也以召囘駐英大使相報復。另一方面，意大利銳利的鷹眼已在四顧尋覔機會，東方的侵略者也派著書主張「天下三分論」的外務省情報部長河相飛滬，將逗留至二星期之久，並傳負有某種外交使命，其將於國際陰謀有更大的發展，是可斷言。這種情形的緊張已顯露，世界各國對於大戰巳至劍拔弩張的地步，戰爭頗有一觸卽發之勢。在這情勢下，英法或許有所畏縮，但應更楚淸認識的，英法能强硬對付侵略者，有時反可以阻止侵略者的暴行，而維持眞正的和平。侵略者正利用着英法等國的這一弱點。民主國家如果不能運用共同的「武裝，來維護「和平」，那末，世界將永無寧靜之日了！</p>
<h3>戰時山西政治底發展</h3>
<p>中國抗戰，自去年「七七」事變以還，經過了　個月來的英勇　鬥，艱苦掙扎，成，今日的空　勝　，政治上逐　統　了全國各階層各黨派的成見，共赴　難；民運上已經發　了廣，的民衆，參加抗戰，我抗戰必勝的先决條件，巳在抗戰的初期過程中充分的具備了，雖然在軍事上抵不住日×的　烈進犯，而節節敗退但我們如果正確的估計到今後廣大游　戰爭的開展，對于日×將有怎樣的不利，並認識了在長開抗戰中，日×將不能繼組支持的客觀條件，那麼我們在抗戰前途上，是非常樂觀的</p>
<p>所有　正確的觀察提示我們：眞正的全面抗　的開展，是爭取最後勝利的持久抗戰的第一幕，因而在中國抗戰的初期中，能推進全國所有的力量，向抗戰的坦途上邁進，能動員全國民衆參加到我們抗戰的隊伍里，便充分的把握了　戰必　的先决條件。否則便是沒有基礎的抗戰，盲上的抗戰，是終歸會遭到嚴重的失　的，會中途轉帶到反革命的路上去，所以在現階段里　縱　令國的各個抗　隊伍　各個抗戰區域，是否民經健全的自身組織起來；在一切動員方面，是否有了鞏固的基礎，這任我們抗　正將轉變中的現段階，是亟應檢討的地方。</p>
<p>抗戰以來。最令人興奮而滿　的，是我全民埃的覺醒，尤其是華北的民衆，為了身受日×的壓迫更為切　，更為長久，所以反抗×日的　緒，也更為高漲。現在河北山西綏遠等省的民衆，已普　的組織起來，不僅在保衛家鄉的任務上，能充分的發揮了它們的力量，並月在襲×擾×的軍事活動上，也建下了不可磨　的功續，無疑的它們將來必然成為我們抗戰的中堅的。以故在華北抗戰的各領域，都注意到積極的民運工作，有不少的基礎　固的游擊根據地，都是以民衆為砥柱的。</p>
<p>本來，日×軍閥此次發動侵略戰爭，目的就在奪取華北，戰爭開始，一直就在　綏平漢同　各路激戰着，日×攻奪晋南以後，山西就普遍的展開了游擊戰，無時無地不在襲擊着×人，這一點我　從　紙上　可以看到，無　×我戰爭的主力究在那一戰區，但在山西的游擊戰鬥，是始終配合着不斷的進行著，這原因一方面由於山西在地理上的重要性，造成×我兩方必爭的軍事條件，而另一方　由於山西扣戰當局能汛速的改革過去的政治　構，能發動新的力量，以實　新的抗戰計劃，所以才能造成今日不斷的打擊×寇的新環境。</p>
<p>政治是在領導地位的，其他一切實施，均須通渦政權的運用才能發生作用，以故我們研究山西的一切新的實施新的改造，必需了解山西政權工作的史的發展，</p>
<p>我們把抗戰一年來山西政權工作的發展情形加以分析，可分二個時期：一，開始動員　期。二，動員法令實施時期：三，游擊戰峪展開時期，這三個時期，都有它特殊的政治環境，在政權工作上當然也表現出各自的　點。</p>
<p>一，開始動員時期——「七七」事變到　原失守。</p>
<p>政治上一切新的改變新的實施，完全適應着新的環境而產生的，同時也受着政治本身歷史基礎的限制，所以我們研究此種新的改變與實施，必需瞭解當時的時代情況的，「七七」以後，全面抗戰開始，在軍事上日×憑藉優越的武器，佔着絕對的優勢，在政治上醫的機構不能適應　的環境而加速崩潰　，在動員上表現出根本的無能，為適應當時客觀環境的需要在政治上實新的計劃，是當時最迫切的工作，所以在此出期政治上的各　緊急措　。是山西政權工作的初具雛形是開展了山西畏期抗戰的前部曲。</p>
<p>一，建立全省總動員　關：舊的政治機　，旣然缺乏動員之能力，那麼在準備長期抗戰的目的上，建立全省總動員機關，是非常要的「總動員委員會」成立以後，把政府軍隊與民　團體統一在一個目之下，完全打破過去政時對民衆輕視的陋習，而且對於民衆組織及政治改革與人民生活改善上，盡了很六的協助作用，不過由　當時各縣行政人員的落後，下級　部的缺如，對於一切新的任務，不會運用，也不打算運用，這是所有的唯一缺點。</p>
<p>二、實行戰時財政政策：第一步卽頒佈了合理負担實施方案，把合理負担的三大原則　得和息者重重負担一「有財產者多多負担」「賺錢多者冬負擔」正式具體　，這是整個中國財政政策上的一大革命，同時在抗戰的過程中，民衆的認識，也逐漸的覺醒，對于「有錢出錢，大家拚命」的口號，也無形中默認了，以故在這個方案實施以後，對于民衆生活的改善上，也頗具成效。</p>
<p>三，組織民衆的新　劃：中國初期抗戰，在戰士方面，必然有重，的犧牲。為了發動大批新戰士使源源走上戰塲，山西當局頒佈了「優待抗戰軍人家屬條例」，這是動員新戰士最有力的武器，是使每一個戰士能自發　走上抗的戰隊伍來的最好辦法，但在戰爭的　續發展中預料着僅憑正規電作戰的不够，此外必須發動整個的民衆參加抗戰，才能繼續支持下去。所以在當時卽發表了「村民組織大綱」把一切男女老幼壯丁完全組織起來，但實際上客觀環境還沒有相當的成熟，一般民衆的舊的社　生活，還沒有撤底破壞，因而還沒有進一步的　覺，所以民業的組織，不能　全，但値得注意的是開放農救工敎，與武裝太原榆次工人自衛隊的偉大措施，這里表現出山西當局對組織民衆與武裝民衆的最大决心。</p>
<p>四，疏散太原居民與遷移國防工業，在準備長期抗戰上具有極大的意義，太原居民在一禮拜內，由十五萬人口疏散到七萬　右，兵工廠與紡織造紙等工業，悉數移往後方，太原雖告失陷，但在物質方面却沒有多大的損失，以資×用。</p>
<p>五，劃分游擊區，是準備持久抗戰的第一幕，在太原失守之前把全省劃為七個行政區，作為游擊戰鬥的根據地，在現階段中能不斷的打擊×人襲擾×人的各游擊部隊，都是當時開始建立起來</p>
<p>二，動員法令實施時　——太原失守至日×進攻晉南，</p>
<p>太原失守，中國戰事重心南移，在山西×我兩方均着重齡理部隊，×＼人雖曾淮攻晉北游擊匾，但戰事一般的在停頓普，這是整個山西轉　到新的方面的過渡時期，當時持久戰游擊戰的局面，開始開展在　個人的面前，所以山西的軍隊與民　都　始游擊化了，一切作風也漸漸傾向新的方面，這從抗戰初期中長成的優越的成績，雖然由于時代與環境的具備了的條件，但在政治上一切措施仍是主要的原因。一切政治上的樹立，均能合于時代與環境的需要，能藉此休養生息的機會來實行偉大的革命動員計劃：</p>
<p>一，堆行第二期緊念動員法令，是當時最急迫的一件事，這是由各行政區公署負責堆行到每一個縣區村里，他們的工作總計：A、撤消無能職員。剷除瓖官壞神壞人。B、新財政政策的實施——　執行合理負担案』，積極的實施着，同時「處置漢奸財產』，「保管潛逃富戶財產」，也隨戰爭的深化都被提到財政問題裏。C、整理修械廠，軍服裝，醫療所等以建立國防工業，D、實行優待條例，普遍組織脫離生產的自衛隊游擊隊。E、發佈減租減息辦法，以改善民衆生活。</p>
<p>二，澈底改革舊的政治機構，撤換舊的縣長，另任以堅强革命的同志，澈底推行民挨革命十大網領，以謀進一步的發展。</p>
<p>三，戰時財政政策進一步的實施：免除了一切指雜，如斗捐牲畜屠宰等稅收　均於廿七年一月一日起停止徵收，過去由于封建性稅收機關向來的特殊剝削制度如「牙子」一類人物，也隨之而被民衆淸掃了，此外更確實推行合理負擔的新辦法，在「有錢出錢」的原則下，解　財政問題。</p>
<p>四，族革命敎育的設施，是當時自最合乎時　的需要而產生的新的計劃，抗戰以後，全國革命同志及靑年知識份子在一抗戰高於一切」與民族革命統一戰綫之下，急欲參加到抗戰的隊伍，以求民埃解放的最後目的，但實際上我初期軍事的失利，各大都市相繼陷落，都市要的靑年知識份子，流浪逃亡無路走上戰塲的嚴重事實。是當　的絕大損失，所以民族革命的口號還需要大磬疾呼的極力提介，以號召全國革命同志迅速的走上抗戰的路上來，我們　，在民族革命大　在臨汾成立伊始的盛況，便可充分的說明民族革命敎育的實除性與正確性。</p>
<p>5　晉翼察邊區政府的成立，也是這時期的　大產物，為了支持持久抗戰，我們需要有鞏固的游擊根據地，但邊區政府的特點，還不僅此，它是各黨各派共同組織成的聯合政府，財政社會經濟政策完全以『有錢出』為基本原則，這種機構，巳經在全國抗戰的戰略上形成了不可缺少的部份。</p>
<p>三，游擊戰略展開時　——×人進犯晉南及進犯以後。</p>
<p>日×進犯晉南企圖打通山西，以奠定侵華北的基礎，但事實上日×所能佔有的只沿鐵路綫的地方而已，其他梢遠的城鎭鄉村，無論日×永還不能佔据，耶佔据以後，亦必遭受我們的襲事而迅速的撤退　這是日寇始終最感惶惑的事實，但我們却能抓住了×人的弱點，有計劃的展開了全省游擊戰略，在軍事上我各游擊部隊均轉在×後方工作，隨時隨處均給×人以　力的打　，在政治上注意在推毀×偽組織，破壞×寇企圖，自省政權西移後，縣區領導上的進步，行政機構的改書，民主政治制度之建立與發揚，財政制度之合理實施，工商業之提高，都表現了新的作風，表現了抗戰過程中，在×後方抗戰建國工作的開展，</p>
<p>一，如政治主任公習均切實的負起鞏固搜大游擊政權的任務，一切政務及財政籌劃，統歸政治主任公署處理，它們必要任務在：</p>
<p>A．恢復抗戰秩席——理軍政　關係，維持金融并注意難民收容等事項。</p>
<p>B．創立民意機開以發揚民主精神，實施政治領導，集體領導，普遍滅員滅薪，財政公開以養成新政權的新的作風。</p>
<p>C加緊動員民衆，配合軍隊作戰，參加破壞交通與偵察嚮導慰勞等工作，使自衙隊本身力量之加强，以凖備游擊根據地的基礎。</p>
<p>二，對×偽組織之打擊與摧毀，是佔着政權工作上的主要地位的，這可以從幾方面來說：</p>
<p>A各　政權的恢復使漢奸維持會在民衆中失掉欺　蒙蔽的號召力，並盡力揭破×偽的種　陰謀，使×人的政治統治企圖　由實現。</p>
<p>B開展游擊戰，把×人的力量縮小到城圈以內。</p>
<p>C對×偽工作之開展，使×偽租織內部不斷瓦解。</p>
<p>三　實施戰時財政經濟方案：是具有革命的戰鬥意義的，完全按戰時的狀態，合理的確定稅收貿易土地等的執行辦法。</p>
<p>A抗戰經贊主要的從執行合理負担沒收漢奸財產及貪污財峰方面籌措，此外更扶植，　工商業，開展合作社運動。</p>
<p>B定轉入×後方留易原則，統制留易，禁止食糧　花等軍需品輸入×區，禁止與×貿易及使用偽鈔。</p>
<p>C確定戰時土地使用法，本土地不荒廢之原助，將潛逃富戶士地及一切公產　無條件的由村公所交給有勞動力的人民耕種，這是『耕者有其田』土地主張的實現，是『土地村公有』在抗戰之下的新發展。</p>
<p>四、民挨革命敎育進一步的實施，是為了創造持久抗戰的靑年幹部的我們深切的感到—靑年知　份子的重要性：它是抗戰中的先鋒隊，它是發動民衆的生力軍，所以迅速發動　年知識份子是今日刻不容緩的事，但只有實施民族革命敎育。才能糾正靑年的錯誤觀念，堅强靑年的抗×意志，自×寇圍攻晋南以後，如行政區的設立革命中學小學，並統一的製定敎材課目，內容純條抗戰適用知識及抗戰必勝理論　並講授救國主張及三民主義按勞主義等學說，</p>
<p>上述各種政治上偉大措施，係針對着當時的客觀形勢而實施的，×寇進犯晉南以後，不堅定的份子大半逃亡，漢奸維持會的活　在沿鐵路的城市與×寇佔領的地區內醒釀着，同時我大部份部隊也開始了游擊戰與運動戰，但對民衆的關係，仍不能進一步加緊民運工作，所以怎樣爭取民衆，怎樣發動全省的民衆，完全參加抗戰隊伍　，是當時非常重要而急迫的問題，『五一』的偉大號令，就是主要的執行，這個神聖的任務的，是閻司令長官在五月一日提示全省軍政民各方圓共局努力的目標。</p>
<p>一、健全我們的政權</p>
<p>二、摧毀×偽組織</p>
<p>三、改良車紀爭取民衆同情</p>
<p>四、動員民衆抗戰到底</p>
<p>實際上『五一』以後，民運工作普遍的開展着，在「政治領導軍事」原則下，軍隊里邊也負起宣傳民衆，組織民衆的任務，全山西的民衆在×寇壓迫之下，已有普遍的覺　，再加上積極的政治領導軍事化的組織起來，無疑的是一支堅强抗戰的生力軍，他們決與×寇周旋到底；　鬥到底：</p>

<p>金華</p>
<p>金武永公路幹綫共長六二。三〇公里，永康至金華段佔三分之二，記者自水康汽車站乘車，乘客一共丸人，據云：近日的旅客雖稀少，但客車仍能按時的行駛，這確為交通事業所具的精神。蓋浙東的公路幹支線及縣道，年來在浙省府積極開築下，已完成預定的路綫計劃，且與江西各公路之重要據點相連接，常時工事大都征之於民，有力者自已應征、，無力者雇工以　，今日江浙二省之公路，對車事上實有極大的貢献。因公路半坦，雖車行極速，車座並不覺顧動。在公路兩　，全是高聳的山峯，汽車無異行在巨石之間。沿途村落頗多，每至小站，車略　數分　。車將抵金華站時，路旁有很多正在搭造中的泥屋，據向平人說：近來因人口增加，所以到處在建搭這類簡陋的泥草星，以解决住的問　。</p>
<p>交通中心</p>
<p>金華今日不僅為浙東軍　　動的中心，且亦為內地交通的樞鈕，蓋金華除浙　鐵路之杭　段以其為中心外，尙有金武公路及金蘭公路、均以其為起點，金武永公路自　南隔江的上橋起，南經嶺下的朱鎭入武義境　至永康，此路為通浙沿海岸溫州的唯一要道，目形勢重要、現今至內地者，都經上路轉入。金蘭公路西　蘭豁縣，係自金武永公路的今古亭地方為起點，而分支入蘭谿境，這條公路，因與浙贛鐵路的蘭谿支綫成平行綫，所以現在沒有按時的班里行駛。但一且在必要時，其重要性並不小於金武永路。北山公路則為便利游金華　山之旅客而由縣府建造的，現浙籍鐵路經過積極的籌備，浙江與桂林閒間聯連已通車，而以金華站為起點，　今日的金華，其在內地的交通上，巳處　重要的地位了。</p>
<p>物產富饒</p>
<p>金華縣的出產，以農產主體，特產亦以農業副產　首位，全縣年產一六三〇·〇〇〇担，普通農產方面、年可產小麥八〇·〇〇〇担，大麥七〇·〇〇〇担，雜糧三六〇·〇〇〇擔，其他尙有大豆糯米等，總共每年的普通設作　產額有一百八十餘萬担。故今日金華雖為一人口塵集之大城市，然在民食方面定供自拾。在金華的城區農，到處滿顯得是繁榮的狀態，街上。旅舍。食館都是塵滿了人。金華是浙東文化事業　發達的一地。初級敎育方面，私立小學有一百八十餘所，縣立的二十四所，中級敎育計有省立金華中學，男女學生九百餘人，敎員七十餘人。省立金華實臉晨業學校，學生百餘人，金華縣立初級中學，有事生三百八十四人，私立的尙有作新初級中學，學生二百二十人，成美女子初級中學，學生六十餘人，在這個擁有着　量智識份子的金華，他們對於抗戰情緒的激烈，救亡工作的努力，也就可想而知了。在金華不僅是當地的畢生們組織救亡團體，尙有許多來自滬抗一帶的救亡團體，歌詠隊，救亡戲劇團，他們都打成了一片，喚醇了整個金華以及鄰縣的民衆。</p>
<p>民情熱烈</p>
<p>金華城區有幾處　兵醫院，設施頗佳，看護方面的工作很多是由當地的靑年婦　們担任，在金華城　的抗戰劇場，時常有救亡宣傳的表演與演說，除了話劇外，最受人歡迎的是歌詠，在金華的民衆會唱幾支救亡歌，像「壯丁上前綫」，「保家鄉一之顯，都自覺是很光榮的，金華不僅每個學校有　救亡歌詠隊或話劇團，其他如縣婦女會，縣市黨部等都有組織，全縣總共不下二三十個，所以今日金華全縣的救亡宣傳空氣特別盛，他們不僅在本縣內工作，同樣的也在浙東的各地宣傳着，無疑的，金華就是浙東一個活動的中心，城內的最繁盛段，自西市街到蓮花井一帶，也全是一片新氣象，全縣有壯丁六萬餘，凡屬壯丁年齡的，不分階級，都須編組受訓，成績極佳。每於淸晨傍晚，城郊外時有一組組的受訓壯丁，於敎官領導下操絲，記者所見，各隊受訓壯丁均服裝整齊而動作敏捷。値得吾人提出的，當地方倉庫的建造，金華縣府當局，因鑒於戰時貯糧的重要，及調整糧食的價格起見，最近除舊　庫倉外，另建成積榖倉一座及農禽二座，平時可容榖九千餘担，尙有新式倉庫一所，面積爲七。三畝，在短時期內亦可完或。</p>
<p>名勝之區</p>
<p>金華有北山，其脈自東陽縣的大盆　而來，蜿蜓起伏長凡四十餘公里。歷代名儒倍道，很多在此隱居　學。故金華山古蹟勝景星羅棋布，以前浙江省政府以此闢為風景區，北山公路卽為是而建。記者慕其勝蹟，出金華的西大門取道北山公路步行而往，經十五里而主羅店，冉繞道山徑行　里。抵雙龍洞及冰壺洞，因大時　寒，不能入洞，僅由雙龍茶店雇人在附近導游一周，冷壺絕景的水晶簾，也就沒不看到，殊覺可惜。</p>
<p>蘭谿</p>
<p>由金華　蘭谿，浙贛鐵路有金蘭綫支，僅二時　右可達，蘭豁過去屬金華府、民國後才廢府為縣治，到民國二十二年之秋，浙省府定為實騐縣，經幾年來的努力辦理，蘭谿全縣各鄉鎭均有着良好的組　興秩序。蘭谿是一個有着數十萬人口的大都市，除縣市外。游埠，諸葛，永昌，女埠等地，都是很熱鬧的車鎮，目各鎮與縣市，均有公路汔車相互接連，亦為浙東的一個重要地方。</p>
<p>設酒精廠</p>
<p>蘭谿是婺，衙，甬三港的中貫，縣上卽位於三港合衆之豐。故浙省的商業，在沿海一帶以寗波為中心，內地以杭州為中心，而浙東運河流域的貨運，則以蘭谿為。匯，故今日的　谿由於戰時環境的　成，不僅爲各地水　　通的重地，目為今日浙東商業的集合地，更形緊榮起來。蘭豁本縣的農產每年有二百六十餘萬祖，持產以甘陣為十，年產十六萬左右手工業。甚，有造紙，榨油，烟絲，糖，火腿及犇畜等。工業方面，亦有　廠數家，最近金華及蘭豁二地人士主辦酒精廠一所，聞出品之質　，成績固佳，這件新與的數事工業，亦足為吾人所　重視者。（完）</p>

<h3>中國統一的——回顧與近況</h3>
<p>— 國際反侵略會代表　毛那著</p>
<p>二九三二年，蘇科爾斯基刊行一書，名『亞細亞的火盒』，在第五十二頁上說：</p>
<p>『中國此前的內爭史，晚起來並不是『件令人感到愉快的事。以個別而論中國人是可愛的民族；若以集團而論，則他們在目前的局勢裏，呈無組議無政府的狀態。』</p>
<p>蘇先生的讀者稱彼為最能認識中國事變的著作家，故其言頗堪注意。同嘗第二百丸十三頁上又說：</p>
<p>『內戰與革命，中國將還有若干年，這可謂自然不易的公論。在中國，內戰巳成為家常便飯，見慣不驚。由於這樣的方式，中國略改其政活及社會的統系。』</p>
<p>在第三一七至三一八頁上再說：</p>
<p>『中國恒貞不變的內戰促成異邦的侵略與分崩離折的危險。也許中國人不是不知道，但內戰還要繼續。』</p>
<p>日本處心積慮，預備侵略中國，分裂中國，吞併中國，這些逐步進行的計劃，蘇爾科斯基早巳看得淸淸楚楚。外患如是嚴重，然而中國的內戰。自一九三二年後尚續演四年，直至一九三六終乃忽然停止，次年（一九三七）上期，可晚是中國的樣準年。為什麼呢，請看美國商務參贊不列的著述：</p>
<p>『中國財政的安定雄持住了，幣制的統一已有進步了。……稻米的收成，銅油與棉花的出產，都非常好，在一九三七年七月中，就一般的事象而論，比以前若干年任何時候都令人樂觀，興奮，』</p>
<p>除開右面所列舉者外，還有一樓更重要的事實是：在中國歷史上，第一次她於一九三七年夏可以向西方借欵而不需抵押。但這時日本人來了，實溝播的七七事件爆發了！</p>
<p>不過這不足為奇。在一九三一年，中國復興的機的巳　一度照臨，蓋其時國聯準備了一個大規模的多方面的助華計劃，正要見諸實行，然而日本抓住了這個要緊的時會，趕快藉口中村事件，進襲瀋陽搶奪滿洲，以便破壞。</p>
<p>在一九三六年底，共黨與中央不再作戰了，以往不能合作的團體，最後的也沒有了，中國於是要統一了。不過八個月以後，日本便又來大幹二下，這回不是覇據滿洲而是進兵華北了，魔手伸入中國的內部了，這時中國巳沒有內戰，難道日本進兵是因為中國內戰的關係，須來維持秩序？或怕有更大的叛離中央，這類藉口雖然找不着　，但日本也趕急進攻，不觀一切。如是的侵略，中國自然不得不起而抵抗；日本見不能再作部份地慢慢細嚼，於是一變蠶食的政策，更妄想鯨吞全中國了。（未完）</p>
<h3>各國人士注意　我國抗戰　反侵略會來華代表　被聘赴美演講實況</h3>
<p>【中央社重慶十九日電】國際反侵略運動總會去年派遺來華之代表色立德氏、及毛那氏、自返歐後、對中國抗職情形及日×之對心、有極詳盡之報告、頗引起各國人士之注意、頃據可靠消息、美國擬請色氏或毛氏赴美演講關於中國之情形、現在積極準備中、</p>
<h3>三民主義青年團　宣傳大隊　羅致優秀青年專門人才　訓練完畢即開各地工作</h3>
<p>【中央社重慶十九日電】三民主義靑年團中央團部、因工作需要、羅致各地優秀靑平、及戲劇，繪書、昔樂、攝影各項專門人才、成立宣傳大隊、由該團文化組長魯覺非兼指導、王微君任大隊長、刻正一面訓練、一面工作中、俟受訓完畢、卽開赴各地宣傳云、</p>

<p>【中央社福州十九日電】泊間江口外之三×艦、于十八日晨他駛、</p>
<h3>隨棗之行</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者雅</p>
<p>勝利即在眼前</p>
<p>在襄陽聽得第××師有幾輛汽要運軍用品去隨縣；該縣是東北則威脅×人保衛武漢的據點，在南部則掩護我鄂中抗戰的一個重要戰地——機會難得，便去接洽褡車前往視察。</p>
<p>該車在樊城城外××里××村，去時約在下午三點多鐘，沿路夕陽西下，軍歌四起，聲浪激昂雄壯，聞之令人興奮。到時，向一位姓文的負實人接洽，允於次農淸早搭車偕往。文君并謂，四鄉駐軍，雖與城市遠隔，但各置有收音機，故各方消息尙不隔膜。我現有主力軍人數，巳增至二百師以上，且舊式槍砲，全數換成新式利器，以實力三分之一配備×后游擊，三分之一在各戰場戰爭，其餘則在戰區鄰近后方加緊訓練。總之，一切抗戰實力，均較二期堅强，勝利卽在眼前</p>
<p>榮譽戰士豪語</p>
<p>次晨在樊城乘車東發，天氣平白放請，使人多有一番戒心、卽恐×機遠來歡迎也。行經張家　，雙　各地，尙太平無事，將抵棗　時，忽見路上大隊徒手行軍，　見麥地草叢中發現兎鹿，大衆便四散獵逐，司機知道這是什麼一回事，也停車敎我們散開。那時野村鐘　打得很急，頃刻伊見×機盤旋上空。</p>
<p>有幾位軍人堅持要走，說道是無關緊要的偵察機。官長却不准亂動，說機聲很重濁，還恐另有轟炸機來。於是他們不耐煩似的重復又躺在草地上。</p>
<p>『同志！你們眞可欽佩，傷剛好又要英勇地踏上前線去了。』我巳經知道他們是榮譽大隊的弟兄。</p>
<p>『那里話？我們很慚愧，沒有把日本×趕走，自己反街了彩。他奶奶的！現在總算好了，眞高興得重上火線。這次去定把×子殺個精光，不然也要拚死在前線——我巳帶過兩次傷，這回絕不好意思再帶着傷下來了。』</p>
<p>『……我們沒拿槍同你們一樣去幹，這才眞是——』</p>
<p>『你太客氣！』另一個弟兄立刻搶上來說：『現在打仗，前方後方同樣重要，要是沒老百姓在後方努力工作，帮助前方作戰，如擔架運輸，建築工事等等，單靠我們是不會勝利的。』</p>
<p>『呢　』先和我講話的那位又說：『何况，現在打仗，兵民實應打成一片，兵就是老百姓，老百姓就是兵，二致相親相愛的幹去，才能把×子趕得走呀。』</p>
<p>他們還告訴我，「前在上海抗戰時，由軍政部防空處發下防毒面具，製造精良，耐用美觀，每具約合國幣十六元，可惜有些弟兄不曾用慣。認為携帶累贅，，隨便將它棄置不用，或將玻片零件拆掉，充作乾糧袋，可是現在大家都知道利害了，不論×人使用怎樣慘酷的軍器。大家都會小心翼翼地加以戒備了，』足見第二期抗戰，我前線將士精神和較備，都較第二期有了長足的進步。</p>
<p>鄉鎭較城市繁榮</p>
<p>警報解除，繼續前進，走過棗陽車站，才知×機巳在城內投彈肆虐。沿路所經要地，都有舊築新修的碉堡，從棗陽至隨縣，數量尤多，有許多山林村塞，未雨綢　。都早巳部署好游擊據點。隨棗兩縣民間武器計有槍械××萬校以上。還有風靡二時的黃道會大刀會和紅槍會等，他們使用大刀，長矛，長槍等普遍武器，還未統計在內，他們在豫鄂邊區的潛伏力很大，巳分別改組成抗×救國衛隊、受縣政府領導，協助軍隊工作，參加游難戰爭。其他在豫鄂邊區游擊司令部，及鄂北游擊司令部指揮下的正式游擊隊，他們都和前綫抗戰軍隊一樣，有政治基礎，有堅强幹部，有良好紀律。</p>
<p>隨縣城中的民房，機關，甚至城牆，都已改了舊觀，倒塌崩壞，血跡斑斑，全帶着民族復興所不可避免的榮譽創傷了。這倒不全由於×機的肆虜，因為×軍自去冬在城　南淅河隔岸相待以來，它們高踞河東紅土山上的炮位，便可向城廂大肆　擊，但禮尙往來，我砲兵亦可遠射×砲測所，屢次中其要害，故隆隆之聲，時斷時續。</p>
<p>城中人口，已疏散後方，尤其疏散四鄉鎭市、商業經濟機關，大多數向西移往××鎭，當夜，由隨縣繞赴××鎮，巳十點多鐘了。入夜鎮上燈火如畫，人聲鼎沸，尙大趕其夜市，舊從武漢運任的布匹，洋貨，日田品等，其價目反較襄樊低廉一倍有奇，加以各師團政工入員及戰地服務團，也多　集那一帶做工作，且得當地優秀農民參加贊助；無諭演劇歌詠，組訓民衆，護送新綀兵員赴×後等等，工作都能順利進展，得到很大的成功，社會秩序之良好，一般人心之安定，更使來自後方的人加以　多的讚美。</p>
<h3>江浙兩省絲業　摧殘殆盡　各地絲廠均遭×方刦持　低價收絲吸我農民膏血</h3>
<p>【上海通訊】江浙兩省蠶絲事業、年來經政府積極　倡改良、產量大增、佔全國三分之二以上、為對外貿易之大宗、自戰事爆發、兩省淪陷、江浙絲業、悉遭蹂躪、日方並為實施經濟侵略、陰謀掠奪統制、絲業現巳摧殘殆盡、茲經向各關係方面探誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>江浙蠶豆絲　產量豐富</p>
<p>江浙兩省、因氣候適宜、地地肥沃、頗合千蠶桑之蕃殖、故其產量、佔全圖三分之二以上、尤佔國外留易之重要地位、自民國廿一年、府實業部為改進蠶業、增加產景起見、經悉心擘劃、設立絲區、並向美國訂購改良蠶種、設立養蠶人員訓練所、組織大規模絲廠、、產額更見進展、每年可產蠶種三百五十餘萬張、出口生絲百餘萬擔、打破以往產量紀錄、奠定海外市場基礎、</p>
<p>淪陷以後　慘遭蹂躝</p>
<p>自抗戰發坳、江浙兩省、痛告淪陷後、各區蠶桑、慘遭蹂躪、日軍並强將桑種拔去、損害之重、尙難統計、旋日方為陰謀掠奪我國蠶絲事業、經派熟悉我國情形之木容、久保田昌、人佐瀨旭等、分批至江浙各地產蠶區域、實施調查、並前三井洋行職員鈴木格三郎、勾結漢奸張子振等、於去年夏　、在無錫組識「惠明公司」、將原有之禾鹽、振義、安餘、福綸、振元等各絲廠合併、共計絲軍二千餘部、資本定為五千萬、由日人星忠勇任經理、漠好張子振任協理、其原料來源、均向各區人民、強行刦奪、或以低價勒迫收買、听有蠶繭、亦悉遭搜括、以是該公司至去年底止、為時僅數月、竟獲利達二百餘萬之鉅、實則均係蠶農之膏血、</p>
<p>華中公司　陰謀統制</p>
<p>該「　明公司」於去年八月後復改組爲「華中蠶絲公司」、並加緊侵略陰謀、希圖實施統制華中絲業、擬定各項計劃、對蠶種桑場等、均施管理、本年一月份起、該偽「華中公司」曾向各種　、提出下列條件、公司對每場得派日人經理一人、常川駐場、管理一切、薪水由種場負擔、（二）蠶種由公司分派、不得複製和分讓、（三）蠶種由公司收買、（四）種欵於製畢時先付一半、餘視蠶收情形如何、　全會或折　、（五）該章程公司有隨時修改之權、以上辦法、會由日方迭次召集各　種場開會、但因一般場主、深明大義、激於愛國義憤、不願受其宰割、故均拒不參加、故日方此項陰謀、尙朱獲全部實施、</p>
<p>內地僅存　小型絲廠</p>
<p>江浙兩省絲產、在日方蠶力重重壓迫下、原有開設抗、嘉、湖、錫、常等地規模較大之絲廠、悉遭刦持、但日方對用軍十部或二十部之小絲廠、則並不重視、故一蠶絲業人員曁農戶、遂凑果小額資本、購辦絲單若干部、卽在各鄉間設立小型絲廠、因　價低廉、尙能稍獲利潤、其中資力校充者、則遷至滬市租界、設廠開工、據調查所得、滬市絲廠計有怡和絲廠、上海絲廠、同仁絲廠等三十七家、絲軍共六千餘部、現海外華締市價、每担遽一千二三百元、故各廠營業尙作云、自「華中公司」設立、今後原料、　成問題云、</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>和平陳綫強化</h3>
<p>德國再度毀約背信併吞擔克共和國以後，歐洲形勢益轉嚴重與危急，民主和平各國處　亦僡見困難與險惡，於是民主國大團結與和平　綫强化的消息，亦迭現報端。其中最為人注目的事實是：</p>
<p>一，英法美蘇各國先後聲明對于德國非法併吞掩克，决不予以承認。</p>
<p>二，美政府于十九日正式送出指實德國的牒文，美財部亦卽宣佈增加德貨入口稅。</p>
<p>三，倫敦外交界十九日批評張伯倫政策巳完全失敗。</p>
<p>四，倫敦泰晤士報十八日評論商務大臣赫德森計劃遍訪華沙莫斯科及北歐諸國首都的重要性，指出英蘇經濟合作接近，亦卽英蘇政治合作的開端。</p>
<p>五，法總統定廿一日赴美，訪羅斯福，商民主國團結。我們今日對於和平陣綫的力量，固然還不能作十二分的信賴，而且還不免有為時巳晚的感覺。然而我們如果同時觀察到侵略集團的色厲內荏，同時觀察到民主和平各國廣大求目由的人民大衆與全世界廣大被壓迫羣衆之將一致為支持和平陳綫而奮鬥，則順逆勝負，無待下警，甚盼英勇抗戰中的我國同胞，各自加勉！</p>
<h3>德繼續東侵！</h3>
<p>德國侵略者佔領捷克後，目下已積極準備權續東侵，大掛德軍巳離捷京東開，有以羅馬尼亞及南斯拉夫為劫奪目標之勢。羅馬尼亞業巳實行動員，準備抵抗，並請求英法蘇聯加以援助，據倫敦各著名報紙（包括泰晤士報）觀察，希特勒大慾難饜，一步成功，卽作第二步進攻。尤可注意者，穗國今日優犯目標，不是日常宜傳的進政蘇俄，而為進向東南，企圖造成稱雄地中海與中歐的德國！這事尤足為民主和平各國引為警惕。我們在這裏仍須特別指出的，第一是由於侵略者本身內部的困難與危機，尙無立卽進犯實力雄厚之蘇聯的胆量；第二是侵略者今後之野心，巳無重分殖民地，而為重新分割歐洲，當若干中間國家弱小民族先後征服以後，其刃鋒听向，即為平日以妥協政策協助侵略者的資本主義民主國家！</p>
<h3>祝新文字學會</h3>
<p>拉丁化新文宇，在中國雖僅為一種藉以掃除文盲發展入衆文化的嘗試，然經各方實騐結果，較諸過去羅馬字拚音等，確較完善，為易敎易學易行的工具。去年中宣部並曾加以稱許，而上海及其他谷地實騐成績，尤稱美滿。本港過去　會有熱心人士，努力提倡，但以久缺整個計劃。復遭一部份人對之有所懷羅。未獲應有的成効。茲悉本港政府巳准新文字學會立案，成立大會巳在籌備舉行，並决增開日夜班招生。我們於欣害之餘，希望該會能就純學術文字研究立塲，以美發展大衆文化之功，而興論界尤當為促進文化服務人羣而盡。盡力互相協助。</p>
<h3>捷克瓜分後　德匈會妥協嗎？（下）</h3>
<p>— 董平鐸</p>
<p>匃攫盧森尼亞的內幕</p>
<p>這裏應當談到匈牙利。她永遠不會忘記，今日的喀巴什烏克蘭，便是她的舊土。這，便是她這次進軍强佔，共同瓜分的理由。而且。她也跟德國一樣，是個推動秘密暗鬥的好手。</p>
<p>因為近年來，德匈關係算是很密切的，所以大家不好意思公開劃破臉，雙方都在暗中調兵遺將，互相鈞心鬥角的對搏，</p>
<p>在喀巴什鳥克蘭，匈牙利也老早佈下了她的間諜　。幾年前，我在維也納遇到一位異常出名的捷克新聞記者，他的衡頭，是盧森尼亞「眞理報」的主筆。　他常常到維也納走動。後來，我才知道他實在是烏克關獨立運動的主腦人物，很為烏克　人民所尊敬。他曾在捷克洛斯伐克，波蘭，及蘇聯境內，竭力鼓吹大烏克蘭獨立的思想。如果烏克蘭眞告獨立，首任總理一定是他。他的名字叫白　第。</p>
<p>後來，我又遇見他。一天，同他在維也納的大街上散步；突然間，他向我道了聲「少陪」，逕自走開了。我望見他定進匈牙利公使舘。</p>
<p>不久，我便完全明白，白羅第與匈牙利公使舘，而且如道，那是異常重要的。</p>
<p>慕尼黑協定之後。盧森尼亞便在捷克期洛伐克國家內，正式成了喀巴什烏克蘭自治區，它的首任總理，不是別人，正是白羅第。</p>
<p>白羅第跑到捷京，會見那時的掩總理獨眼將軍希洛維。他突然提出一個驚人的要求：喀巴什島克蘭人舉行公民投票，讓他們自己去决定他們國家的命運。無疑的，這時公民投票的結果，是無補於　克斯洛伐克，而反帮了匈牙利。</p>
<p>希洛維大怒，跳了起來，大　白羅第是捷克斯洛伐克的叛徒：「快滾開，永還不要議我冉見到你」！</p>
<p>白羅第回到許士特，他馬上發現他巳被撤職。他的繼任者伏洛遜，是一個正宗派敎士。</p>
<p>等到希特勒一聽到白羅第提出無理要求的消息，他立刻叫他的秘密警察，去找尋有關白羅第的一切情報與材料。他們趕到維也納，把白羅第的住宅，大肆搜查，結果找出了一件証據：那是一紙白羅第與匈牙利政府簽訂的協定。在那裏面，白羅第同意把喀巴什烏克蘭弄來送給匈牙利。而他的報酬是六〇〇·〇〇〇元·兩塊封地及一個男爵的銜頭，</p>
<p>於是，希特勒便把這張證據送給捷克政府，捷克政府立刻下令遠捕白羅第。第二天大淸早，許士特的新建飛行場上，一擊起飛的飛機中，便有一架是載着喀巴什烏克蘭的第一任總理，現在是當做一個囚犯的送到了擾京。</p>
<p>白羅第被控告的罪名，是叛國不忠與貪污腐敗，預備要判以重刑的。德國則在後面頻加壓力，要求非把白羅第處死不可。但是，等到耶穌聖誕的時候，白羅第却釋放了。</p>
<p>於是，現在臨到要注意繼任者伏洛遜的時候了。他是一個天中敎宣敎師。在喀巴什烏克蘭，除了敎士之外，會讀會寫的很少，所以一個官敎師之任為總理，是并不希奇的。</p>
<p>雖然，在慕尼黑協定之前，伏洛遜無藉藉之名。他是一步登天的上官的，現在他巳經是目下歡洲新危機中的主要人物。</p>
<p>伏洛遜的目的，卽在盡他最大的能力、建立瞎巴什鳥克蘭的獨立。這正是希特助所贊同，而加深切鼓勵的。</p>
<p>匈牙利政府自然不贊成這個。不久以前，匈牙利人民在許士特街上遊行示戚，態度異常激昂，常常提出要求。終於，在這一次，趁火打劫，進軍佔據喀巴什鳥克蘭全部，總算宿　終償了。</p>
<p>但，事情决不是這樣簡單，雖然，現在一切以乎巳經告一段落，平靜無事，可是，希特勒决不會把他多年來苦心經營的一塊土地，慷慨的讓給別人的。何况，以這塊土地為支柱點，還有更遠的目標——攫取肥美的蘇維埃島克蘭——　以達到呢！</p>
<p>希特勒是不會太安靜的。等着吧。在那個小小的地方，不久之後，終是國際消息的來源。</p>

<h3>港緊急救難會分會主辦　難童教養所新姿態　所長何澤宏到港一席談</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>『媽媽！我的肚子餓了！』在劫後的惠中，隨處可以聽到這樣的哭聲！</p>
<p>『一　如洗之後，還有甚麼錢進華校！單校能够復課的亦是寥寥無幾—那就只好遊蕩挨過日子，一天天往墮落的路上跑！』</p>
<p>——在劫後的惠州，隨處亦可以有到這樣的現　—被×人蹂躪過的災區是慘痛的—但是，承接我們這一代的小主人失養，失敎，更使我們心酸—而為民族的並途憂　！</p>
<p>惠州光復之後雖亦有一般，「幼吾幼以及人之幼」的慈　家私八捐欵，委托附城各　　理敎養難童事宜。但是，收容的人數很少，且偏於消極的養，而忽略積極的敎。香港緊急救　難民會駐惠分會，遂本慈愛之精神，伸山然烈之手，援助災區的兒童。巳先在惠陽設立難童敎答所，以期「敎」「養」兼施。難童入所讀　不僅免收一切學雜費，而且每天兩餐飯一亦由所供給。在收復的淪　區負起這個敎養　童的任務，不消說是迫切的需要，而且含有深遠的意義。</p>
<p>在　痍滿目的淪陷區，嗷嗷待嗖的難　聽到這個喜訊，僅僅惠陽城裏，九百八、一一個難童，就立刻湧了上來。該會　月撥助　洋一千六百元經費只能收容三百人，經過考試興審定之後：結果六百八十三人是向隅了！這亦未始不是一件憾事！</p>
<p>考選的標準是以智力學力較高而遭受刦搶校慘之難童。投　者為謁望榜上有名，多數是初中生報考高級生，高級生報考初級生。「生的掙扎的　苦心，香港一般窮奢栩侈的僑胞不知聽了作何感想！</p>
<p>該所設　惠陽秀水湖縣立女師學校，是一個敎育兒童的好環境。所長何澤宏，副所畏劉堯咨，都是認眞幹總的靑年。一個對外呼籲求援，一個對內專掌敎務，兩人互相合作，相得益彰。敎員每月只領二十元毫洋的生活費，為兒重服務的精神亦令人欽仰。學級　制方面自一年級至六年級分為六班，每班五十人，恍如完全小學。該所組織在正副所長之下分敎務，訓育，事務等部亦略似一般小學行政。至於課程方面，則與一般小學略有差異，所　學科有六：一，國語（包括三民主義，戰時常識一二，精神講話，三，時事講解，四，歌詠，五，簡易工藝；六，體育設國防遊戲。</p>
<p>在牧復的淪陷區實施施時兒重敎育是很艱辛的：因此，該所定同仁亦公約互相盟免：一，任勞任怨·二，與不厭，誨不倦；三，爲　業和工作；四，爲敎育盡忠：五，為難童造福。——這自是　心肺的生活態度。</p>
<p>至於敎導上的原則是：一，以做為中心；二，以自動自發為學習原則；三，以集體的自我敎育為敎育的指標；四，適合抗戰與兒童　需要。這亦未始不是戰時兒童敎育的新姿態。他們每天的生活，自從晨光微就開始晨操。上課，工作，起初開課幾天，三百個「雜色部隊」的秩序，衛生·在在都有問趣；訓練過一個星期之後，立刻就呈現　整齊，嚴肅，活潑，緊張的蓬蓬勃勃的朝氣了。排隊到膳堂吃飯時，秩序很好，煞像孩子軍。（如圖）碗子筷子是各人從家裏帶來的，這是家長們在愁眉苦臉中所僅有的微笑。</p>
<p>在他們全部的生活中三個特點：（二課程方面是盡量與抗戰配合，而且是接受淪陷敎訓之後，每個小朋友都有窩度的民族參覺性；（二）簡易工藝，一注重生產訓練，聘請技衛人材訓練各種小手工業，現在巳經陸續有織竹籃，鷄籠，竹蘿等日用品的出產。（如圖）製造墨水，香糊亦在計齜中：（三）團體活動方面，每天有小組討論與集體批判。這一羣天眞活潑的小主人，還用歌詠，戲劇，宣傳……在刦後的惠陽推動健設　鄉，同仇敵愾的怒潮，眞是在苦難中生長起來的一羣。記者在聽吋君的報告與看他們的像片的時候，深深受其感動，而益信潛伏着的民族力量之偉大。</p>
<p>該所原定試辦一個月，經於本月十二日明滿；在何所長苦心經營，四方奔走呼籲之後，經得到慈善團體之接濟已决定續辨四個月，小朋友及其家長深深感載其恩惠。</p>
<p>何所長鑒於在刦後各區鄉村如平山，淡水等地亦有迅速成立難童敎養所之必要，所以，這次冉度來港向緊急難民救濟會，及許世英氏等請求援助，進行頗為順利，日間卽可囘惠繼續工作，</p>
<p>何所長為使難童敎麥所師資健全，負起調練民族小英雄之偉大任務起見，將以惠陽縣黨部名譽——他自己是縣黨部書記長——設社會服務工作人員訓總班，招考高中畢業生入班訓練，巳定本月廿五日開學，以伊將來分派各區鄉担任難童敎養所敎員，兼辦社會服務，為下層機構之幹部。刦後的國士漸漸復活起來了，深願出錢的，熱心出錢，出力的，認認眞眞地幹！好教民衆有所慰藉；好叫×人有所警戒！</p>
<p>難童敎養所難童作藝情形</p>

<h3>在香港初發現的　「狗」展覽會觀後</h3>
<p>資產階級的有閑玩意</p>
<p>早上，還沒有到十一點鐘，花園道聖約翰廣塲前面，華麗的汽車陸續出現，下車的中　士女，喜氣洋溢、驕傲地拖着抱着他們的愛犬，有如慈母帶孩子到外邊去散步的一樣親密；這種享受，這種溫存，使好些人看見了，不免有點「人不如狗」之感！</p>
<p>狗展覽會，在香港還是初次，新的玩意兒，吸引到不少好奇的觀衆。一塊錢的門券，雖不能說是便宜，但是這囘展覽收入所得，是全部撥給香港防止虐待畜類會做經費的，雖則是狹義的慈善事業，到底比單純為圖利而展覧好得多</p>
<p>參加的狗的種類，大別之可以分作四種：（甲）獵犬類：（一）犬（獵犬），裏面包含阿當汗種，芬蘭種，愛爾蘭種等十八種；（二）獵犬，內分十五種；（三）犬，內分十丸種。（乙）非獲犬類：內分狼犬，中國犬，牛犬，聖巴納種等二十四種。（丙）玩具犬類，內分北京犬，小型犬等十一種。（了）其他，包含六種，參加的狗的數目，共計一百一十五頭，其中的幾頭，因事缺塲。此外還有十四頭貓，也放在塲中展覽。在塲的母狗有幾隻還把誕生不久的小犬帶來，據它們的主人說，假使把小犬留在家裏，它們是不會同意的。狗的主人或是僱來服侍他們的男女工人，通通陪着靈加展覽的狗坐在一起，不時以食物或水喂它們，用刷子替它們刷毛，用銀枘的　把毛撥起，以增加它們的妍麗。場內并目陳列着狗的食品，如餅乾之類：狗的藥品，如滅蛋樂水之類；食品和擊物的齊備贊美，假如把包面說明的招紙除去，誰會知道這是專門給狗類來受用的呢？</p>
<p>陳列在會場　的狗。種式實在多得很，可惜記者不是養狗的專家，所以未能一一詳細地介紹給讀者，眞是憾事一我所蟯得的祗是大小的差別，許多是前此沒有見過的，眞是眼界為一之開。在我看來，每隻都有做冠軍的資格，小的像北京犬，小型犬，重量約在四五磅之間；大的像丹麥種犬，聖巴納犬：重量總在七八十磅以外。養犬者的心理，因人而異，大約婦女輩多半喜歡嬌小玲瓏的玩具犬，男子却愛大犬，自然，例外是不會沒有的，不過，　養大型的犬，消費是頗可觀的，卽以著名富商余東璇送來兩頭聖巴納犬來說，出此還不到一年，祇稱為「小犬」，却長得比小牛差不多，據說，這些未週歲的「小犬」。食量很不差，每天最少要牛肉一磅，餅　一磅，才能够裏腹。他家裏還有年紀較大的聖巴納犬，食量可比這些「小犬」大得多了，我們由此可知，養狗也不是一件容易的玩意！</p>
<p>評判人員從上午十一點多到下午五點，除了午餐休憩片刻之外，工作常忙碌，分門別類去判定孰優孰劣。每一類的獲首獎的犬，由覽會贈給藍色絲帶，上面寫着「冠軍」，附有證書，注明該犬所屬的種類，主人的姓氏，并獲得銀杯一座。亞軍獎的犬，得紅色絲帶和證書；季軍獎的犬，綠色絲帶和證書：入選獎的犬，獲白色絲帶和證書。港督夫人主持領獎的時候，做主人的自然萬一分高與，給主人抱着「或奢拖着的狗，好像多少有得點兒人性，　傲地願盼自豪似的，正是「一登龍門，擊價十倍」！</p>
<p>獎以後，狗展覧會就宣告閉幕，得意的人和狗，失意的人和狗與冷靜的來看熱鬧的人們，在嘈雜的人聲中，豬狺的狗吠中，紛紛離開了展覽會場，聖的翰廣塲中，也跟　恢復了原來的恬靜。（新）</p>

<h3>戰時的中山</h3>
<p>— 黃文楷</p>
<p>（本報特約通訊）抗戰二十個月來、中山早就在×人覬龥之中、×機的轟炸和×艦的環　窺　、巳不知多少次、但每次的艱危、都能在鎭定中渡過、同時、中山的抗戰力　、也就存此艱苦的環境中長成、目前與初期、顯然的巳有了很大的進步、在×人卡開始侵略華南之前、一般人的估量、×人進侵的路線、或有在中山屬的唐家　的可能、因為當時唐家　確曾聚攏了不少×艦、就照情理來說、中山也自有很大的危的、</p>
<p>可是日本終於在大亞灣登陸、陷落廣州之後、更沿西江進侵、中山雖然不致孤立、可是與內地　聯絡也受了很大的影響、地位也就更為嚴重、在目前華南戰局中、相當値得法　、</p>
<p>空防的改善</p>
<p>中山的空襲、有一個時期簡如家常　飯、一日數驚、在炸彈　飛中、自不免受了相當的損失、可是中　也就在此得到可貴的經騐、在每次空襲的時候、交通團團長周克明、防空處處長周守　和各部職員、一律要親自在驚報之下維寺秩　、統屬於交通團的　車行、木匠、鉄匠、手申俟和苦力等、在空襲中的任務是指導避難、在街道上的孩子婦女、都由手車　載到防空壕里躲避、在屋內的、則由木匠鐵匠負實勸導避入　空　、這樣有計劃的避難、很能收效、最近石歧雖也曾經過許多次的空襲、但是死傷巳沒有從前那麼慘重、只是民房略受損害而已、</p>
<p>石歧多山、山勢頗高、就利用這些天然的地勢來做天然的防空壕、×人雖然消耗了不少彈藥、可是能够達到屠殺我同胞的目的尙少、</p>
<p>糧食問題</p>
<p>關於糧食問題、最近在中山　得很嚴重、本來中山縣屬正是　米之區、每年所產的米量、除了足供本縣之用外、還可以把剩餘的運到鄰近各地接濟、這次意也突然鬧起米荒來、眞是出人意想　外之事、據稔悉底蘊的人說、中山米荒的主要原因是米商集中探　的關係、　濟鄰邑糧食、本來勢難嚴加拒絕的、旦中山俘諸的米糧究竟有限、以之供給鄰邑無限的需求、事實上是勢所難能的、近來更有一些米商、因為別縣出價較高、有利可圖、因此也就不顧一切、暗中出售、遂至形成今日中山縣糧食恐慌的嚴重問題、</p>
<p>記者曾邂逅袁帶於第二區、偶然和他談起中山的糧食問題、他有點感概的說道、一因為戰事的關係、中山民衆有許多都已遷到安全地方、因人口的减少、中山糧食本來應當更見豐裕的、這次米　、自然是意外的事、不過有一點是最堪宛惜的、以我所知、有一部份不良的米商、曾偷偷的把存米賣給×人、賣×以糧、無異增厚×的力量、這是不可不注意的、</p>
<p>中山的武裝</p>
<p>一踏進中山　境、你就會感釗中山似乎是滿縣皆兵、來來往往的、都是年着戎裝、配　武器的　士、這些　士、就是自衛團、他們遍佈於各區、支持着長明抗戰的力量、他　的武噐是自備的、他們的經費是由各區負担的、十足的表現　中山人民的抗戰精　、</p>
<p>有一天、記者在中山茶樓和黃副官談戰事問題、　暢然說：「根據兵去來說、×人顯見是失敗的、第一、勞師遠征、為行軍之最忌者、反之、我　以逸待勞、必然獲得勝利、第二、行軍最忌姦爲刦掠、因為軍人本應以戰鬥爲目的、對於民衆不能有所侵犯、×軍在淪陷區的行為、正是犯了這大大的毛病、第三、　　　稀、也是×軍的大弱點、第四、支皆戰爭的要作、第一是經濟、日本的經濟、已逐漸瀕於崩　、所以、我們的見解、最後勝利屬于我　的把握更為定穩』、</p>
<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>介紹幾個　替身和複影人　工作繁重而不爲人所知</h3>
<p>當每一個觀衆、在他鑒實了某一張名片後、對於該片所以受人歡迎的原由、恒歸功於片中男女主角的演及、這　觀點、雖有他存在的價値、但在事實上、是並不絕對不錯的、因為正還有一班幕後的英雄們、如　演、　影師、置景師、教音師、場記員、劇務員、道具員、炡光指導員、影星『替身』Sgtand-ln和影星「複影」Double等、他們對於每一張影片的成就、也都是厥功甚偉、可是除了導演和攝影師、他　或有受人項　的幸福外、其他人員的一筆汗馬功勞、都被抹殺、最大的原因、當然為了他們並不在跟幕上露險的關係、　在銀幕上有露　機會的影星『替身』和影星『複影』等、却也往往得不到一聲嘉獎的言辭、似乎更屬不平、何況他們的工作、較之影星鬥的還要困難而有危險性呢、然而在好萊塢的影城中、所以會有許多從事於這種代人古名的工作人員、而似乎樂此不疲、就是為了都裏抱有一固有一日能不故影星的『替身』或『複影』而成大明星的願望在、</p>
<p>擔任影星的『皆身』或『複影』並不是一件輕易的工作、先决條件、是要有着和影星同一的身材、面貌、膚色和高度等等、因為他們要代表影星們在囈影機前對光、或替影星們代析有危僉性的鐐頭、例如一對熱情男女在擁吻時的持寫、在對光時、總由二個彩星的「替身」來承當的、自時為了角度光線的關係、竟擁吻達五六十次之多、而一切滿意後、纔讓男女影星倆自己來任演　　、　樣、大明　從樓　上袞下、或受到奉擊等的畫面、這銀幕上的遭難者、並不是千金之軀的影星本人、而就都是那些該倒運的一替身」、比外若有一幕要重柏的劇情、　主角恰已出門遠行時、不得　那就也由他們的『複影　來代拍了、可是在銀幕下的觀衆、都以為是該形影的本人呢、在好萊塢中的大明星們、幾全　用有自己的『替身』和『複影』這裏我們略舉其中幾個專正大明星們的『替身一或『複影』、也就是在盟片過程中有着重要的貢獻而姓名却不見經傳的男女們、</p>
<p>康尼蘭</p>
<p>是瓊白朗黛兒的『替身』、一個洋娃娃似美人兒、有着紅色的頭髮和稷色的眼　、純稡是美國女兒、生於洛山磯地方、原來的目的要成個法律家、但在大學中攻讀了二年後、又變卦的想當起演員來、在當瓊的『替身』前、也有一些舞台的小經騐、但她覺得現在的工作最合宜、還能得到些眞實的本領、她每天陪伴着瓊演習。讀劇本和做動作、無論在攝影　或在家中、康尼蘭終和瓊白卽黛兒同樣的裝飾打扮、不過　矮了一些、所以特別穿了較高的高跟鞋、以補不足、她現在的新水、是五十元一星期、康尼是已經結婚了、婚禮時由瓊白期黛兒給她當女賓相、丈夫就是狄克鮑惠爾的經理人、</p>
<p>李卻福斯德</p>
<p>是李思廉霍華的「替身」、這位單身漢子是同母親妹妹合居着、曾在奧海奧和南加利福尼亞大學十讀商算及商業管理、他當霍年的『替身』的見解、說是可以見到眞實的製片情狀、備作將來献身銀幕的一個基礎、李卻進人影界、是非常意外的、原來某晚他　進一家　場、遇到一位導演先生、他對李却　、「你到攝影　上來找我、我有工作給你做、當時李卻根本沒有想到　影界工作、所以化隔幾大後再去看那個導演、就被派作李思廉的『替身』、從霍華和茂娜洛埃及安哈導台拍的AnmalLlngdom起、一直是做着他的『替身」一個『替身』必然同明星很接近、所以李却深知李思廉是一個十足英國氣派的男子、他是好萊塢最有趣的人物六尺三寸的瘦長子、也就是賈萊古柏的『替身』兼『複影』他倆同是蒙泰拿牧塲馬貨上的老朋友、泰爾鮑特不但在面容身材上和占柏相像、就是性情脾氣也莫不相似、走路的姿勢美妙、沉　寡言、他曾人伍當過兵士、歐戰時是飛幾駕駛員、就是現在他仍是航空協會中的會員、當初他是同古柏一同投身影界充當臨時演員的、但是命運的支配、他祗能當一個『替身』、在古柏出外行獵時、他也得一塊而去、只此一點　他倆今日相同的地方、泰爾鮑特有一憫志願、是能來華投入空軍隊伍中、為人類的正義奮鬭一下、</p>
<p>唐密羅</p>
<p>命運這虛幻的東西、老是做着有　的玩童兒、在五年以前、有二個靑年、為了經濟問題而台借一間屋子、而且交換穿着內衣和領帶、這二個人都是抱有進入影界的雄心的、除了一個是唐密羅外、另外一個就是他的『正身』今日亨有盛名的小生羅拔泰勒、在四年以前、泰勒對人說、他的好友是唐、現在雖然環境變遷的吏他成了天字第一號大明星、但他仍舊以密羅為至交的、拿事實証明、當泰勒到英國去拍攝時、英政府限制他帶技術人員同往、而祗可帶一個朋友時、他不和白倍蘭史丹妃同往、而是和唐密羅借行的</p>
<p>安羅實遜</p>
<p>她是　　薇第哈佛蘭同華納公司合同上訂明她的「替身」在哈佛蘭還未進影界時、她儞就在一起生活、安是把奧麗薇看作領袖似的、而奧麗薇也像姊妹般的對安、在她生日時總送她很貴重的禮物、因為是『替身』和「正身」的關係、加以二人一起生活得很久、所以安是極瞭解哈佛蘭的一切的、她說、「哈佛蘭是眞煩惱、因為她不喜歡和一班不稱心的男友出游、於是有人散佈她有高傲脾氣的謠言、因之使哈佛蘭為了要討人喜歡、每每不得不和不稱心的男女一同游玩了』安是從丁尼西州來　、曾在丁尼西女子學院、專攻　琴、後來又到好萊塢來充當臨時演員、又由公司中官傳部職員介紹她做預備演員Stock　Girl每星期只十六元的酬報、但自做了哈佛蘭的『替身』後、有五十元一禮拜了、在她的「正身」小姐沒有拍戲時、經常在別部影片中任不重要的配角、現在她承認和華納公司的重要職員熱繼着、不久就要結婚了、</p>
<p>邁爾莫利夫</p>
<p>是加萊葛倫的『替身』及『複影』、一個凱西球大學的學生、常走出校門而未進影城之前、充當職業榨球家、後來在某次大賽中、竟折了手指骨、於是不得已的結東了這運動家的生活、到好萊塢來做加萊的「替身」、並經理他的一切雜務、邁爾除了由公司中付給他薪金外、加萊個人也給與他同樣酬報、這拿到雙份薪金的靑年、乃娶到一個洛山磯的漂亮小姐做太太、雖然今年還只廿六歲、却已是個四歲小孩子的爸爸了「替身」的工作、有人悲哀的為他落淚、但邁爾却以為對藝術的修養上、有甚大的帮助、在空聞時、常和加萊凱絲玲赫本等、共同研讀劇詞、得有不少淮益、最近邁爾到翳完中去割治手指時、醫藥費也是加來代付的呢、</p>

<h3>國際賽淘汰英格蘭隊　中華奪得爭標權　四比一中華先敗後勝　李惠堂表露體育精神</h3>
<p>【本　專訊】昨天午後在加山舉行的國際足球複賽、給果不出我們所料、中華隊以四比一的球數淘汰英格蘭隊、獲得决賽權、　全賽過程是這樣、開　後未够五分鐘、華隊先失一球、此時英隊聲勢最盛、攻多於守、旋而形勢轉變、華隊反攻甚烈、惟　惠　四次妙射、均厄於劾利之手、扣門不入、徒喚奈何、這　時期、亦最為緊張、冉有頃、華隊由馮景祥扳囘一球、還以顏色、而華隊反敗為勝之局、由此急轉直下、全上半時將終、華隊已以二比一佔先、惟攻勢仍未稍殺、遂見英隊門前、「刻數驚、劾利因撲救梁榮照之猛射、弄到左手受傷、兩指折斷、相信非經半月之治理、未卽復原、劾利受傷後、　兆榮乘便多勝一球、以三比一結束上半時、易地丹戰，華隊常佔優勢，惟英隊抵拒甚力、遂成混戰狀態、後來　由惠堂多勝一球、以四比一奠定大局、</p>
<p>在此役中、有一事最値得紀述的、是惠堂富有體育精神、在一舉一動中、都表露出米、當下半時劾利負傷守關、華隊頻取攻勢、在理、華隊至少可勝三四球、尤其是惠堂幾次單騎直入的機會、又以他射術至有把握、如不是隨便舉足、似未有不中鵠的、惟他因見劾利受傷、復以己隊巳穩操勝利、故雖有再勝之機、雅不欲乘人之危而多取幾次迫近射門、也不過輕輕一撥、在一般不明他的用意的球迷，都以為他舉足時的力道不足、殊不知他不發力猛射的原故、並非「餓狸悲鼠，」而是留一餘地步、不欲使那巳受傷的劾利、再逢更痛苦的遭遇、故惠堂此種仁俠舉動、實非一個平凡的球人所能做得到、</p>
<p>華隊各員表演、捨黃景聰無善足述外、其餘均稱職、以前線而論、惠堂中央突破之成功、俱得力於馮景祥傳交合度，鄧廣森頻頻活動、亦多賴景祥之供應、黎兆榮因知左翼不能利用、乃常　惠堂景祥作三角式短傳、此種戰略、固華隊所擅長、昨戰尚算運用得宜、故獲大勝、又以後方而論、三前衛在開賽十分鐘、頗覺失常、以後　入佳境、進退一致、兩內衛則以候容生最惹人注目、因他表演大佳、看客皆贊許、譚均幹幾次妙救險球、功勞至大、尤以上半時拍出達菲路之妙射、最見功夫、英軍之敗、固為技術程度所限，未足與華隊爭一日之雄長、然各員演出、甚為　力、前內衛　、　覺堅牢、祇是　線各員除奄巴臣有　異　演外、其　的踢法、都像得前衛脚頭、傳運非佳、衝刺亦不力、</p>
<p>柏架富於經驗、以巧制人、表　之、誠出吾人意料、劾利未傷市前、亦多佳作、代哥　之禮地士、亦中規中矩、</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>（四分鐘）華隊逆風而戰、異常吃力、英軍右鋒磨十、乘猛攻中衝過、天生均幹離城搶救、覓對方前鋒所阻、幸榕生單騎掩護、踢球出界、寧負角球、踢出後、又為英軍所得、再迫角球、達菲路底線送出、奄巴臣于人叢中發射、一舉入網、（一比〇）</p>
<p>（十七分鐘）惠堂曾經四次猛射、皆為劾利救去、已而景祥別闢蹊徑、突將球轉交兆榮、兆榮得意忘形、滿擬一射中鵠、不幸被判越界、垂首而囘、</p>
<p>（廿三分鐘）量祥舉動敏捷、運輸得官、惠堂遂得衝過戰壕、怒馬突進、景聰亦乘勢抄入腹地、惠堂以機不可失、發力直攻、炮彈甫入、詎又為効利所接、</p>
<p>（廿五分鐘）榮照奪獲衣史林蘭治之球、斜交兆榮、兆榮急送景祥、景祥找着機會、猛力射出、其速如電、劾利欲救無從、遂以一比一打成平手，</p>
<p>（卅分鐘）榮照得竟成之傳遞、左顧右盼、發覺惠堂站在安全地帶、立即千里送糧、惠堂巧過拍架、單刀赴會、禮地士及拍架窮追莫及、英軍乃告冉次失守、二比一之勢　成、華軍出此急轉直下，</p>
<p>（卅五分錢）惠堂與榮照暫易位置、榮照掛印中鋒大演身手、竟于猛攻中、單騎迫入射鬥、其勢極勁、劾利雙手推出窗前月、柏架急踢出界外、僅負角球、此際劾利因救球而傷指、包裏冉戰、以後演出、氣巳　餒、遠不如前、</p>
<p>（四十分鐘）兆榮景聰左右路發動、菲十窩打等前彈壓、兆榮得景聰　助、潛進門前，射球入網、乃成三比一之局</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>（十分鐘）華軍轉移新陣地、得順風之　、攻勢甚銳、祗因英軍防守嚴密、無法破關、</p>
<p>（十五分鐘）英軍一度反攻、連迫三角球、傾師圍擊、均、妙手搶險、榕生加上一脚、　軍至是退出、</p>
<p>（卅二分鐘）華軍攻多守少、勝利在握、游龍戲鳳、精　異常、　而惠堂又得惠祥之妙傳、遠射中的、成四比一之數、淘汰公軍、獲得决賽權、兩陣如下、</p>

<p>開球後、幾分鐘內、廣人陳兆祿吳宣昭先後射籃、造成十比〇之紀錄、港大幾經進攻、始由許昆倫得囘兩分，已而廣大陳兆綠、鋒又露、變方成績、先後成為十十八比二、及三十六比四之數迨及張少勉兩度建功、然港大卒以九比四十九先負上半場、旣而易地冉戰、廣大攻勢稍歛、港大頗有力挽頹局之勢、不料廣大盧働又逞雄威、造成五十八比十三、及六十二比十三之　錄、迨至全場結束時、廣大以八十比十七大勝、</p>
<p>末場乙組康元對廣中、兩隊勢均力敵、上半場廣中雖以十五比十佔勝、但下半場康元極力反攻、在最後十分鐘內、曾以廿五比廿一佔先、嗣後彼此肉搏益列、花落花開、各小相　、　度打成平手、在最後一分鐘、實中始以三十比二十八小勝　元、各場成績如下、</p>

<h3>也來談談兒童體育　（四）</h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>住　童沒有限制的吃、固然有碍健康、但是有節制的吃而不顧吃的東西　淸潔還是污穢、是新鮮還是陳腐、不加選擇、隨便亂吃、其禍害更甚於沒有限制的吃，因為無限制的吃、不過消化的器官受到損害、而污穢　腐的吃、就可以把殺人比槍砲還要利害的微生物吃進肚裏去、幾天甚至於幾小時就可以送你回老家、而我們、時隨地都可以看到我國的兒童、在弄着污穢的東西以後、雙手染滿了壓埃、就用這雙微茵大本營的尊手、拿了食物往嘴理送、甚至於腐爛不堪的食物、也大嚼不　、做父母的、往往不知道怎樣去指導、眼睜睜的看了他們吃下這健康的大敵、</p>
<p>穿衣服的目的是保護體溫、多少的程度、應當隨着氣候的寒暖而增減、總以適宜為度，太少和過多、不但失了穿衣的本意、而且可以　嚮　的健康、我國兒童的穿衣是怎樣、一冷了就　棉　裘、穿得兒童　腫呆笨、動也不能一動、一熱了就單衫薄褲，甚至脫得兒童赤身管露體、不他們是不是能忍受、一日之間、兒童的穿衣、可以從冬變夏、由夏變冬、這樣驟寒驟熱的穿衣辦法，成人也可以因此感冒、兒　　能不因此　病、</p>
<p>「多愁善病、」是一句憂愁足以影響健康的老話、兒童卒來是樂天成性不知什麼作叫憂愁的、這句老話在兒童力面似乎用不上，但是因為他們宰制肌　的神經、發育尙未完全、所以舉動每不凖確、因為他們的腦部成長尙未成熱、作用幼椎。所以言動每多錯誤，做父母的往往斯望他們的兒童來得過於急切、因此一遇到兒童有不　確的舉動和錯誤的言行時、他們都毫不原諒，輕則要罵，重則要打，甚至於　了還要加　打、打了還要加上罵、使兒童周身覺得沒有是處，他那敢怒　不敢言的抑鬰不平之氣、積　在胸中而不能發洩、這種精神上無形的剌激、具禍害身體、勝過任何一種有形的不民環境、加之兒童那樣軟弱的體質、怎能橫受這樣無情的待遇、</p>
<p>這一切的一切、或者足以使兒童汨滅好動的天性、使他們成為呆頭木腦、揮一揮一動只能被動不能自動的人物、或者不能予兒盧以及時的適宜鍛　、使他們都成為鐵鈇一般的天使、為國家担負起復興的重仃、或者足以影響兒童的健康、使他們鍛鍊的工作、事倍而功半、不能收速作速成之效、我們不談兒童體育則已、　要議釗兒童體育、我以為非先把這些一切　　、驅除凈盡、然後　對着需要、研究一個適宜的方法去實施、不是眞正的根本辦法、　（完）</p>

<h3>從原始的騙術到最後階段</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>方法是古老的　丹術騙局，都市中有一種一元鈔票變兩元的詐術，行騙者中也有西方人，所以這也如鍊丹術一樣，其起源是一元的或是二元的，還待考據。如果有考據趣味，則趁現在考據，自然較易着手，但似乎要留待千百年後考據本身才有價値，現在我們只能覺得這在詐衛中還算不得一種希奇的，能使人覺得希奇處，轉在被騙者，怎樣他們竟會相信這樣原始的騙術，這不太愚蠢了嗎？但是，我們雖然似乎很能自信不能落入相同的圈套，而會不會落進一種相似的圈套，實無把握，知識的圈子誠然有大小，但在圈子的邊綠，則跨進愚蠢的機會，是相等的。</p>
<p>辯一點地說，我們不相信一張鈔票會變兩張，無寧該看着我們的愚蠢，商業行為，事實上是以一張鈔票變兩張為基本原則的，在商業中，對本利是一個極正當的希求，我們試讀大經濟學家關於備蓄的論文，便可見到他們說，有獎儲蓄是不利的，存進二千元十五年還只有二千元，若作定　儲蓄，則十五年就可有八千元。這就是說，十五年有三個對本利，即五年一個對本利，利率是絕正常的月息一分二厘。這自然不是騙術，而是經濟學，可是這都是廣告作用的，受了這種廣告而去儲蓄的，不會被看作善於理財者，反只是個不能理財的低能者。我們知道有所謂信託這一種業務吧，這名稱顯然地告訴我們，知識低者去信託他們的高見。</p>
<p>高見自然是超出我們的知識圈外的，但我們姑圈子發一個愚問：被信託者要給存欵者一個對本利，又是為了什麼？這裏我們如想窺察高見的深徵，無寧驚奇戲法的巧妙。五年這，在商業者看來，眞是一個長時期，對本利如果五年一來，商人就只能暍西北風。二三年一對，是被認為應該之至的，一年也只算普通，順利起來，半年，三月，十天，五天，也不算奇事。連一天得對本和的希望，也可不列於夢想之內。只有刻立　出。才被覺得是幻想吧？而一刻距一天之遠。是比一天　五年之遠，要小得多的。這裏，我　該信不信一元錢可以在一天內變成對本利的事呢？不信嗎？姑不提投機生意，每一家的兌換小店，丸仙兌進一毫，而一毫他是可變成十仙的。如果每六分鐘來一個用毫洋兌仙的，則一小時後，他的原來十　，就變成十仙又一毫了。這還一點不是幻術，而頗帶幻術意味的商業，實並非沒有。不過巳拆穿的西洋鏡可以不說，而未拆穿的，在有高見為庇護之時，設來也難見信的。</p>
<p>我們大致都還知道預約券的發行吧。有五萬元商品，如能賣出　萬元禮券，隨又拿去買進商品，則五萬元顯然變成十萬元，如果竟有法賣出十萬二十萬的禮券，則變成五萬的三倍都是可能的。賣出這樣多的禮券，自然不像是會有的事實二、可是結果正和此相同的辦法正多着，可以整批地換成一張劵時，還　禮劵式的零買賣事呢，譬如說抵押給銀行吧。銀行家口頭自然說，這樣不德當的交易是不願做的，而實際可頗以這為好生意，放欵者担心的是蝕本，但蝕本了也得先還錢後　門，損失在老板，借欵者希望的是賺錢，賺錢　還了本仍有利進腰包，事實上，在營業進行中，賺錢蝕本是看不出的，於是在沒有特殊變的時期，貨物總可愈滾　多，直到貨物全成廢物才來了總結算，而那時，銀幣巳經　廢物中之廢物了。</p>
<p>這裏，上面的說法的愚蠢處，該被指斥了。說五萬元有變成十萬元的辦法是把以前別人的錢購得的算在老板的帳上，那實是應算別个人所有的，禮券遠可利用人多不來付取，暫時佔有，而借欵則明明是負債，不能歸入自己的賑的。對！但理論上，債有還時，而事實上，債愈欠愈大，正是營業發達一種指尺，轉來轉去，正等於無需還甲是用貨物抵算着，而那却和錢一共着最後的命運。把商業作整个看，可說純然如此。若个別地看，還掉債，蝕盡本因而倒店自也不少。其原因自然是因入不敷出，而這出項總職的大，决沒有在資本額的一二倍以下的，如果我們不想為資本主義辯護其浪費的必要。一變二的打法還是成功的，不及化掉的快而已。</p>
<p>商業上這一點基本巧妙手法，在法西國家就一直應用到財政上，這就在他們自己也知道應用不得的，因為財政上照例化費多于運用，就商業性質說，也是必歸於倒店。不過除此則無出路，也就再顧不得。這更足證明法西主義是資本主議的最後階段那條定律。</p>
<h3>僥倖茍安和平</h3>
<p>— 陳人</p>
<p>把數十年辛苦經營的精力作孤注一擲，以圖僥倖，這無疑地是自殺政策。强　當前，不能奮　抵抗，祗圖苟女一時，這也就等於坐而待斃。</p>
<p>僥倖與苟安，原都是要不得的。然而世界上正多着食圖僥倖的人們，而僥悻者惟豐的希望，却正落在苟安者的身上。</p>
<p>然而世界上的更多着貪圖苟安的份子，而苟安者的惟一希望。却原來是相平。</p>
<p>和平的基礎，原不是建築在苟安上面的。全世界愛姅和平的人　，應該在鬥爭裏求生存，隨時與僥倖者以迎卯痛擊。如果以退讓求妥協，以妥協求苟安，以苟安求和平，那簡直是自取滅亡。</p>
<p>僥倖者張開了血嘴，眼見得把廣州，海南島，以及華南，一塊塊底吞噬下去：但苟安者還在憶着和平。然而和平在那裏呢？答覆的是一片炸彈，砲火的聲音，和整千萬無辜人民的血肉橫飛。</p>
<p>當和平絕望，苟安者的心理，失去其依據的時候，僥倖者的希望，也就免不了落空。待到擲下最後的孤注，真正的和平的曙光，才得重　於世界。張春風</p>
<h3>記陳寅恪先生</h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>陳先生是在敎授羣中最不洋化，圾不講派頭的一位敎授，完全是學者的風度，他上下課，出門，從不俠大皮包，而是挾着粗布製的大書包，包袱皮分紅，紫，黃幾個顏色，　日因為上課的科目不同，那麼他包書的大包袱皮顏色，也有不同。不過他却是一位最具有世界地位的一位畢者。他能自由操英，法文字，在德國曾住有年，德文也是刮刮呌，另外他也曾在印度研究過佛敎，又能讀識說梵文，在淸華大學　，他不止是歷史學的敎授，他也是佛敎研究的指導，教梵文的敎師，學問之淹博於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>在淸華文學院諸敎授中，研究專題最好輾轉打橋的是聞一多先生。但最不好打橋的是陳先生，可見他治學方法的謹嚴，古籍陳先生都能腹誦，最專長的是隋唐，南北朝史，唐　尢熱習。甚至新舊　書都能閉目成誦。日本漢學家都仰佩陳光生，尊之為隋唐南北朝史的權威者，可見陳先生名氣之大。曾以中國哲學史斐聲海內的馮友蘭先生也是陳先生的門牆，所以每次都可見馮先生鞠躬如也的恭敬他的先生，在陳先生為馮先生所寫的中國哲學史的審查報告　裏，陳先生曾有這樣的自曰：「寅格平生為不古不今之學，思想囿於咸　同治之世，議論近乎湘鄉南皮之間……」，其實完全是謙語。他的治學範圍不是『不今不古，』甚而是亦今亦古，思想博大，見地超遠。</p>
<p>他是中國當代惟一著名的史學家，關於治史地也有獨特的見解：他主張『史論者皆認為無關史學而且有害者也。然史論之作者，或有意，或無意，其發為言之時，即已印入作者及其時代之環境背景，實無異於今日新聞紙之社論時評，若普用之，皆有助於考史。』至於關於中國古代著作眞偽之評價，他主張；『以中國今日之考據學，巳足辨別古書之真偽，然眞偽者，不過相對問題，而最要在能審定偽材料之時代及其作者而利用之。蓋偽材料亦有時與眞材料同一可貴，如某種偽材料，若逕認其所依託之時代及作者之眞產物，固不可也，但能攷出其作偽時代及作者，以說明此時代及作者之思想，期變為一眞材料矣。」由於陳先生的眞知灼見，中國史實研究的對象及材料範圍。愈加開廣，所以地在雖磨南北朝史的課上，他不止從大處研究當代的政治經濟，文化制度等等，并且也研究出李白是外國人，劉蛻是波斯人，甚而至於孤　的來源，土耳其浴的方法的東傳到唐　，和　以後帝王宮室的建藥等等，又無一不是他細心研究的對象，記得在淸華陳先生的席上，總他講詩人杜甫及白氏的長恨歌，棄　吟，古詩十九首等等，處處都有令人心折的新發明。</p>
<p>也許是從西洋受來的好會慣　，無論什麼時候上課，他從來沒有遲到過一秒鐘，在不守時刻的敎授通病中，他是個奇人，一年四季，總是『華』服，『華』履，冬犬時候穿兩件皮袍，但又却是粗布的袍面，完全是中國學者的本色。</p>
<p>自從陳先生的尊翁在古城殉國之後，陳先生就繞運南來，寫港守制，家國之愁，又　着他的心。多病之騙，又怎能當得了呢，行見陳先生又將首途出國了，謹在此遙祝他一往康寧。</p>
<p>（完）</p>
<h3>羊與狼</h3>
<p>— 昭彰</p>
<p>如果捷克可比歐洲末一隻　順的羊，那末德國就是狂狼，而英法是牧羊者。站在牧羊者地位的英法，六月前，他們遠想用鞭子把這野獸嚇走，後來看到這狼也許眞是飢餓了，不給他一點充飢，可能發生更大的亂子，蘇台穗犧牲了，以為它不會冉來，從此以後見這隻野獸就可意得志滿和它來一個綏靖歐洲的「協定」，以為天下可以太平了。却沒料到六個月後的狼漸漸的壯大和胃口增長。牧羊者於是被嚇得不聲不響。</p>

        <h1>1939.03.20</h1>
<h3>United States Statement and British Prime Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>Hitler's adventurous actions indeed exceeded the expectations of some world politicians. In the short period of less than half a year after the division of Czechoslovakia, the fact of annexing the entire Czech Republic shocked the world again. The small countries of Eastern Europe are increasingly approaching the tiger's mouth, and they all feel precarious. Although this stomach-risking action by Hitler seems superficially calmer than in September of last year, its danger has deepened even more. The countries most deeply involved in this incident are undoubtedly Britain, the United States, and France, so the attitudes expressed by these three countries towards this incident are filled with extraordinary shock and vigilance. Chamberlain, who had always trusted Hitler most deeply, is no longer very optimistic, France is also preparing to adopt a tough stance following Britain, and the expression of the United States government is even more concrete and powerful.</p>
<p>Chamberlain already had considerable realization in his speech in Birmingham on the 17th, acknowledging that "Germany's atrocities this time were truly unexpected"; regretting Hitler's "earnest promises" of that day, "who knew that his fickleness would be so extreme." This expression is much better than his previous feigned ignorance. But today the problem is no longer about quibbling over past mistakes, as Mr. Zhang said in his speech, but about how to change course and actively research effective ways to sanction the aggressor. There are two key points in Mr. Zhang's speech that are worth noting; one is the realization that "Germany's plan to conquer foreign lands has now begun, or will accelerate aggression outwards in the future," and the other is the realization that "Britain must unite the strength within the British Empire and join hands with France to cope with this situation." Germany's aggression against foreign lands did not begin today, but it is not too late for Mr. Zhang to speak from the heart and save the crisis in the European situation. As for the countries that should be closely linked, it should not be limited to France; the United States and the Soviet Union also have important relationships. Hitler's eastward advance today is also a preparation for a westward advance to oppress Britain and France tomorrow, but the French border, as President Roosevelt said, "is the first line of defense of the United States," and the depth of its relationship with the United States can be imagined. Germany's eastward advance will eventually lead to a direct conflict with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has a linked relationship with Britain and France. More importantly, Hitler's actions are indeed part of a conspiracy by an international aggression group. It is foreseeable that Italy will soon launch an offensive in Western Europe, and Japan will become more restless in the Far East. Then, to deal with the violence of this aggression group, Britain and France alone cannot bear the brunt. Mr. Zhang and other British people should deeply recognize this point.</p>
<p>Therefore, the thorough understanding of this incident and the practicality of the proposed methods should be attributed to the statement of the United States government and the proposals of insightful people in the United States.</p>
<p>The State Department, with the consent of the President, issued a formal statement, denouncing Germany's "insidious tricks, which have threatened world peace and modern cultural institutions." Senator Pittman of the United States even declared in the Senate: "The three dictatorial countries clearly have sufficient tacit understanding in their actions, so one should no longer harbor ridicule about the views on the crises encountered by Latin America." This is indeed a pointed remark. Mr. Bi also strongly advocated: "In order to cope with this serious situation and seek our own defense, we must not delay the necessary political and preparation work." Germany's aggression is not limited to Europe. The fact that it colludes with the Japanese aggressors in the Far East to invade and oppress Central and South America is well known to the general public in the United States. If Hitler's plan to occupy Europe succeeds to a certain extent, his power will inevitably swell, and his fingers will inevitably reach Africa. Therefore, preventing Hitler's tyranny today is also for the sake of the United States' own defense. But the method of defense should focus on what Mr. Bi said: "The three dictatorial countries clearly have sufficient tacit understanding in their actions." If observed in this way, the United States bears even greater responsibility in the Pacific. Therefore, the entire United States should promote military facilities in the Pacific, especially in Guam and other places. Whether the United States can stand firm in the Pacific and exert its greatest strength can determine whether the democratic group can gain an advantage in the Pacific, thereby reducing the restraint of Germany's accomplices on Britain and France in the East.</p>
<p>Now, Britain has recalled its ambassador to Germany, and France has taken the same action. Germany has also retaliated by recalling its ambassador to Britain. On the other hand, Italy's sharp eagle eyes are looking around for opportunities. The aggressor in the East has also sent the Director-General of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, KawaSogo Hifu, who advocates the "Three Kingdoms Theory," to stay for as long as two weeks, and it is rumored that he has a certain diplomatic mission. It can be asserted that there will be greater developments in international conspiracies. The tension of this situation has been revealed, and countries around the world are at the point of drawing swords over a major war, and the war is very likely to break out. In this situation, Britain and France may be somewhat hesitant, but what should be more clearly recognized is that if Britain and France can deal with the aggressor firmly, they can sometimes prevent the aggressor's atrocities and maintain true peace. The aggressor is taking advantage of this weakness of Britain, France, and other countries. If democratic countries cannot use a common "armed force" to maintain "peace," then the world will never have peace!</p>
<h3>Development of Politics in Wartime Shanxi</h3>
<p>Since the "July 7th" Incident last year, China's War of Resistance Against Japan has undergone eight months of heroic struggle and arduous efforts. The result is today's empty victory. Politically, the prejudices of all strata and parties across the country have gradually been unified, and they are going to the national crisis together. In terms of civil movement, a wide range of people have been mobilized to participate in the War of Resistance. The prerequisite for our inevitable victory in the War of Resistance has been fully met in the initial process of the War of Resistance. Although we cannot resist the fierce invasion of the Japanese army militarily and are retreating step by step, if we correctly estimate the development of the vast guerrilla warfare in the future, what disadvantages will it have for the Japanese, and recognize the objective conditions that the Japanese will not be able to continue to support in the long-term War of Resistance, then we are very optimistic about the future of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>All correct observations tell us that the true development of a comprehensive war of resistance is the first act of a protracted war of resistance to win the final victory. Therefore, in the early stage of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, being able to promote all the forces of the country to move towards the open road of the War of Resistance, and being able to mobilize the people of the whole country to participate in our War of Resistance team, fully grasps the prerequisite for inevitable victory in the war. Otherwise, it will be a war of resistance without a foundation, a blind war of resistance, which will eventually suffer serious losses and turn to a counter-revolutionary road halfway. Therefore, in the current stage, whether each war of resistance team in the country and each war of resistance area has been soundly organized by themselves; whether there is a solid foundation in all aspects of mobilization, this is what we should urgently review in the current stage when our war of resistance is about to change.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, what is most exciting and satisfying is the awakening of our entire nation, especially the people of North China, who have suffered from the oppression of Japan more deeply and for a longer time, so their anti-Japanese sentiments are even higher. Now the people of Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan and other provinces have been universally organized. Not only can they fully exert their strength in the task of defending their homes, but they have also made indelible contributions in military activities such as attacking and harassing the Japanese army. Undoubtedly, they will inevitably become the backbone of our War of Resistance in the future. Therefore, in all areas of the War of Resistance in North China, attention is paid to active civil movement work, and many solid guerrilla base areas are based on the people.</p>
<p>Originally, the purpose of the Japanese warlords in launching this war of aggression was to seize North China. Since the beginning of the war, there have been fierce battles on various routes such as Suiyuan, Pinghan, and Datong. After the Japanese army captured southern Shanxi, guerrilla warfare was widely launched in Shanxi, attacking the enemy anytime and anywhere. We can see this from newspapers. No matter where the main force of the Sino-Japanese war is, the guerrilla battles in Shanxi have always been carried out in coordination. This is partly due to the geographical importance of Shanxi, which creates military conditions that must be contested by both sides, and partly because the Shanxi War of Resistance authorities can quickly reform the political structure of the past and mobilize new forces to implement new War of Resistance plans, so that they can create today's new environment of constantly attacking the enemy.</p>
<p>Politics is in a leading position, and all other implementations must be able to take effect through the use of political power. Therefore, to study all the new implementations and new reforms in Shanxi, we must understand the historical development of the work of the Shanxi regime.</p>
<p>We can analyze the development of the work of the Shanxi regime in the past year of the War of Resistance into two periods: 1. The initial mobilization period. 2. The implementation period of the mobilization decree: 3. The guerrilla warfare period. These three periods all have their special political environments, and of course they also show their respective characteristics in the work of the regime.</p>
<p>1. The initial mobilization period—from the "July 7th" Incident to the loss of Taiyuan.</p>
<p>All new changes and new implementations in politics are completely adapted to the new environment, and are also restricted by the historical foundation of politics itself. Therefore, to study this new change and implementation, we must understand the situation of the times. After the "July 7th" Incident, the comprehensive War of Resistance began. Militarily, the Japanese army, with its superior weapons, occupied an absolute advantage. Politically, the old institutions could not adapt to the new environment and accelerated their collapse. In terms of mobilization, it showed fundamental incompetence. To implement new plans politically to adapt to the needs of the objective environment at that time was the most urgent task at that time. Therefore, the various emergency measures in the initial stage of politics were the initial prototype of the work of the Shanxi regime and opened up the prelude to the initial War of Resistance in Shanxi.</p>
<p>1. Establishment of provincial general mobilization agency: Since the old political institutions lacked the ability to mobilize, it was very important to establish a provincial general mobilization agency for the purpose of preparing for a long-term War of Resistance. After the establishment of the "General Mobilization Committee," the government, the army, and civil groups were unified under one goal, completely breaking the old habit of political neglect of the people in the past, and providing a lot of assistance to people's organizations, political reforms, and people's lives. However, due to the backwardness of administrative personnel in various counties at that time and the lack of lower-level cadres, they did not know how to use or intend to use all new tasks, which was the only shortcoming.</p>
<p>2. Implementation of wartime financial policy: The first step was to promulgate the reasonable burden implementation plan, which formally specified the three major principles of reasonable burden: "Those who have wealth should bear a heavy burden," "Those who have property should bear a large burden," and "Those who earn more money should bear a large burden." This was a major revolution in China's entire financial policy. At the same time, in the process of the War of Resistance, the people's understanding gradually awakened, and they tacitly agreed with the slogan "Those who have money contribute money, and everyone gives their lives." Therefore, after the implementation of this plan, it was quite effective in improving the people's lives.</p>
<p>3. The new plan for organizing the people: In the early stage of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, there were bound to be heavy sacrifices in the military. In order to mobilize a large number of new soldiers to go to the battlefield, the Shanxi authorities promulgated the "Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers Fighting Against Japan." This was the most powerful weapon for mobilizing new soldiers and the best way to enable every soldier to spontaneously join the War of Resistance. However, in the continuous development of the war, it was foreseen that it would not be enough to rely solely on regular army operations. In addition, the entire people must be mobilized to participate in the War of Resistance in order to continue to support it. Therefore, at that time, the "Outline of Village Organization" was published to completely organize all men, women, old, and young people. However, in reality, the objective environment was not yet mature, and the old social life of the general public had not been thoroughly destroyed, so there was no further awakening. Therefore, the organization of the people could not be completed. However, it is worth noting the great measures of opening up agriculture, industry, and education, and arming the Taiyuan Yuci Workers' Self-Defense Force. This shows the Shanxi authorities' greatest determination to organize and arm the people.</p>
<p>4. Evacuation of Taiyuan residents and relocation of national defense industry, which has great significance in preparing for a long-term War of Resistance. Within a week, the population of Taiyuan was evacuated from 150,000 to about 70,000. All industries such as ordnance factories and textile and paper mills were moved to the rear. Although Taiyuan was lost, there was not much loss in terms of materials for the enemy to use.</p>
<p>5. The division of guerrilla areas is the first act in preparing for a protracted war of resistance. Before the loss of Taiyuan, the province was divided into seven administrative regions as bases for guerrilla warfare. The guerrilla units that are constantly attacking and harassing the enemy in the current stage were all established at that time.</p>
<p>2. The implementation period of the mobilization decree—from the loss of Taiyuan to the Japanese invasion of southern Shanxi.</p>
<p>After the loss of Taiyuan, the center of gravity of the Chinese war shifted to the south. Both sides in Shanxi focused on reorganizing their troops. Although the Japanese army had launched an attack on the northern Shanxi guerrilla area, the war was generally at a standstill. This was a transitional period for the entire Shanxi to a new aspect. At that time, the situation of protracted war and guerrilla war began to develop in front of everyone. Therefore, the Shanxi army and the people began to become guerrilla, and all work styles gradually tended to a new aspect. This is due to the superior achievements made in the early stage of the War of Resistance, although due to the conditions of the times and the environment, the political measures are still the main reason. All political establishments can meet the needs of the times and the environment, and can use this opportunity to recuperate and implement a great revolutionary mobilization plan:</p>
<p>1. Implementing the second phase of the emergency mobilization decree was the most urgent task at that time. This was the responsibility of the administrative offices in each district to be implemented to every county, district, village, and neighborhood. Their work totaled: A. Removing incompetent officials. Eliminating corrupt officials, bad gentry, and bad people. B. Implementation of the new financial policy—"Implementing the Reasonable Burden Plan" was actively implemented. At the same time, "Handling the Property of Traitors" and "Safeguarding the Property of Fugitive Wealthy Households" were also brought into the financial problem as the war deepened. C. Reorganizing and repairing machinery factories, military uniforms, medical clinics, etc. to establish the national defense industry. D. Implementing preferential treatment regulations, and universally organizing self-defense teams and guerrilla teams that are separated from production. E. Promulgating methods to reduce rent and interest to improve the lives of the people.</p>
<p>2. Thoroughly reform the old political institutions, remove the old county magistrates, and appoint strong revolutionary comrades to thoroughly promote the Ten Outlines of the People's Revolution to seek further development.</p>
<p>3. Further implementation of the wartime financial policy: All miscellaneous taxes, such as taxes on livestock slaughter, etc., were exempted and stopped being levied from January 1, 1938. In the past, due to the special exploitation system of feudal tax authorities, such as "brokers" and other people, they were also cleared by the people. In addition, the new method of reasonable burden was indeed promoted, and the financial problem was solved under the principle of "Those who have money contribute money."</p>
<p>4. The establishment of the ethnic revolutionary education is a new plan that was produced in response to the needs of the times. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, revolutionary comrades and young intellectuals across the country, under the slogan of "The War of Resistance is above all else" and the national revolutionary united front, urgently wanted to join the War of Resistance team to seek the ultimate goal of national liberation. However, in reality, our early military failures and the successive fall of major cities led to the serious fact that young intellectuals in the cities were wandering and had no way to go to the battlefield. This was a great loss at that time. Therefore, the slogan of national revolution still needs to be loudly and urgently promoted to call on revolutionary comrades across the country to quickly embark on the road of resistance. We can fully illustrate the practicality and correctness of the ethnic revolutionary education from the grand occasion of the ethnic revolutionary university's establishment in Linfen.</p>
<p>5. The establishment of the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region Government was also a major product of this period. In order to support the protracted war of resistance, we need to have solid guerrilla bases. However, the characteristics of the border region government are not limited to this. It is a united government jointly organized by various parties and factions. The financial, social, and economic policies are completely based on the basic principle of "Those who have money contribute." This kind of institution has already formed an indispensable part of the national war of resistance strategy.</p>
<p>6. The time when the guerrilla strategy was launched—After the Japanese invaded southern Shanxi and after the invasion.</p>
<p>The Japanese invaded southern Shanxi in an attempt to open up Shanxi to lay the foundation for invading North China. But in fact, the Japanese can only occupy places along the railway line. Other towns and villages that are slightly further away cannot be occupied by the Japanese army at all. Even if they are occupied, they will inevitably be attacked by us and quickly withdraw. This is the fact that the Japanese invaders have always felt most disturbed about. But we can grasp the weaknesses of the enemy, and have planned to launch a provincial guerrilla strategy, on the military I of the guerrilla units were transferred in the enemy's rear, at any time, anywhere to give the enemy a heavy blow, on the political I noted in the destruction of puppet organizations, destroying the enemy's plot, Since the provincial government was relocated to the west, the progress of county district leadership, administrative institutional change, the establishment and promotion of democratic political system, the reasonable implementation of financial system, the enhancement of industry and commerce, all show a new style, showing the development of the war of resistance and national construction work in the enemy's rear during the war of resistance.</p>
<p>1. If the political director general is also really assume the task of consolidating guerrilla regime search, all political and financial planning, unified Political Director Office processing, their necessary task in:</p>
<p>A. Recovery of war order - Management of military relations, maintain financial and attention to the acceptance of refugees and other matters.</p>
<p>B. Establishing civil will open in order to promote the spirit of democracy, the implementation of political leadership, collective leadership, common destroy personnel destroy salary, financial openness in order to develop a new style of new regime.</p>
<p>C. Step up the mobilization of the people, with the army operations, to participate in the destruction of traffic and investigation of guides consolation work, so that from the strength of the defense force itself to strengthen in order to prepare the basis of the guerrilla base.</p>
<p>2. The attack on the puppet organizations and the destruction is taking the main position on the work of the regime, which can be said from several aspects:</p>
<p>A. The restoration of the various regimes, so that the traitor maintenance will be lost in the people deceive, to deceive the appeal, and try to expose the various plots of the Japanese invaders, so that the enemy's political rule attempts are not realized.</p>
<p>B. Launch guerrilla war, the enemy's strength is reduced to within the city circle.</p>
<p>C. on the enemy's work of development, so that the enemy's internal organization continues to disintegrate.</p>
<p>3. The implementation of the wartime financial and economic program: is a revolutionary combat significance, in full accordance with the state of wartime, reasonable to determine the implementation of the methods of tax trade land.</p>
<p>A. The war through to the main from the implementation of a reasonable burden of confiscation of traitor property and corruption financial peak aspects of raising funds, in addition to support, industry and commerce, development of cooperative movement.</p>
<p>B. Set to transfer into the enemy's rear change the principle, control left change, prohibit food such as military supplies input enemy area, prohibited and enemy trade and use of counterfeit currency.</p>
<p>C. Determine the wartime land use law, the land does not fall into disuse of the original aid, will escape the rich households and land all public property - unconditional by the village office to the labor force of the people farming, this is 'tillers' land proposition of the realization, is 'land village public' under the war of resistance a new development.</p>
<p>4. The further implementation of the People's Revolutionary Education, in order to create the youth cadres of the sustained resistance, we are deeply aware of - the importance of young knowledge people: it is the vanguard in the war of resistance, it is the new force to mobilize the people, so the rapid launch of the young intellectuals is today a matter of urgency, but only the implementation of the national revolutionary education. In order to correct the wrong ideas of the youth, strong youth anti - will, since the enemy besieged southern Jin after, such as the administrative district the establishment of revolutionary high school elementary school, and uniform the development of teaching materials subject, the content of pure anti - applicable knowledge and anti - must win the theory - and taught saving the country claims and the Three People's Principles by labor doctrine and other theories,</p>
<p>The above-mentioned various great political measures, based on the objective situation at the time and the implementation of the puppet regime, a large number of unsteady elements escaped, the activities of the traitor organization in the cities along the railway and the occupied areas of the enemy were brewing, and at the same time, most of our troops also began guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, but the relationship with the people still can not be further strengthened the work of the people's movement, so how to win the people, how to launch the province The participation of the people in the anti-war team is a very important and urgent issue at the time, and the great order of 'May 1' is the main execution of this sacred mission, which is the goal of General Commander Yan's reminder to the whole province's military, political and civilian sectors on May 1.</p>
<p>1. Improve our regime</p>
<p>2. Destroy the enemy's puppet organization</p>
<p>3. Improve the vehicle discipline to win the sympathy of the people</p>
<p>4. Mobilize the people to resist the war to the end</p>
<p>In fact, after 'May 1', the work of the People's Movement is universally unfolding, under the principle of "political leadership military", the army also bears the task of propagating to the people, organizing the people, the people of the whole Shanxi under the oppression of the enemy, has a universal sense, coupled with the active political leadership military organization, undoubtedly is a strong anti-war force, they will always fight with the enemy: struggle to the end:</p>
<h3>The Flying Leap Forward in Jinhua Lanxi</h3>
<p>Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>One is the Center of Resistance, the Other is a Commercial Hub</p>
<p>Jinhua</p>
<p>The Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway trunk line is 62.30 kilometers long, with the Yongkang to Jinhua section accounting for two-thirds. The reporter took a bus from the Shuikang Bus Station with a total of nine passengers. It is said that although there are few passengers these days, the buses are still able to run on time, which is indeed the spirit of the transportation industry. In recent years, under the active construction of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the trunk and branch lines of highways and county roads in eastern Zhejiang have completed the planned route, and are connected to the important strongholds of various highways in Jiangxi. Most of the usual construction work is requisitioned from the people. Those who are able-bodied are conscripted themselves, and those who are not able-bodied hire workers to do it. Today, the highways of the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have made a great contribution to transportation. Because the highway is half-flat, even though the car travels very fast, the seats do not feel bumpy. On both sides of the highway are towering mountain peaks, and the car seems to be traveling between huge rocks. There are many villages along the way, and the car stops for a few minutes at each small station. When the car is about to arrive at Jinhua Station, there are many mud houses under construction by the roadside. According to the locals, due to the recent increase in population, these simple mud and grass houses are being built everywhere to solve the housing problem.</p>
<p>Transportation Hub</p>
<p>Today, Jinhua is not only the center of military activities in eastern Zhejiang, but also a transportation hub in the interior. Jinhua is the center of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the Jinhua-Wuyi Highway and the Jinhua-Lanxi Highway also start from here. The Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway starts from Shangqiao across the river south of Jinhua, passes through Zhuzhen in Lingxia and enters Wuyi, and reaches Yongkang. This road is the only important route to Wenzhou on the Zhejiang coast. Its importance is now very significant, and those going to the interior all transfer via this road. The Jinhua-Lanxi Highway extends westward to Lanxi County, starting from Jinguting on the Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway and branching into Lanxi. Because this highway runs parallel to the Lanxi branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, there are no scheduled bus services at present. However, its importance is no less than that of the Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway when necessary. The Beishan Highway was built by the county government to facilitate tourists visiting Jinhua Beishan Mountain. The Zhejiang-Guilin inter-provincial railway is now open to traffic after active preparation, with Jinhua Station as the starting point. Today's Jinhua is in an important position in inland transportation.</p>
<p>Abundant Products</p>
<p>Jinhua County's main products are agricultural products, and special products are also mainly agricultural by-products. The county's annual production is 1,630,000 dan. In terms of ordinary agricultural products, the annual production of wheat is 80,000 dan, barley is 70,000 dan, miscellaneous grains are 360,000 dan, and there are other products such as soybeans and glutinous rice. The total annual production of ordinary crops exceeds 1.8 million dan. Therefore, although Jinhua is a large city with a dense population today, it can definitely provide for itself in terms of food. The agricultural areas in the urban area of Jinhua are full of prosperity everywhere. The streets, hotels, and restaurants are all crowded with people. Jinhua is a developed area for cultural undertakings in eastern Zhejiang. In terms of primary education, there are more than 180 private primary schools and 24 county-run schools. In terms of secondary education, there is the Provincial Jinhua Middle School with more than 900 male and female students and more than 70 teachers. The Provincial Jinhua Vocational School has more than 100 students, and the Jinhua County Junior High School has 384 students. There are also private junior high schools such as Zuoxin Junior High School with 220 students and Chengmei Girls' Junior High School with more than 60 students. In Jinhua, which has a large number of intellectuals, it is conceivable that their enthusiasm for resisting the war and their efforts in saving the country are intense. In Jinhua, not only local graduates have organized national salvation groups, but also many national salvation groups, singing teams, and national salvation drama troupes from the Shanghai resistance area. They have all come together to arouse the people of Jinhua and neighboring counties.</p>
<p>Ardent Popular Sentiment</p>
<p>There are several military hospitals in the urban area of Jinhua, with good facilities. Many of the nursing duties are undertaken by local young women. In the anti-war theater in Jinhua city, there are often performances and speeches promoting national salvation. In addition to dramas, the most popular are songs. The people of Jinhua feel very honored to be able to sing a few national salvation songs, such as "Young Men Go to the Front Line" and "Protecting Our Homeland". Not only does every school in Jinhua have a national salvation singing team or drama troupe, but other organizations such as the County Women's Association and the County Party Headquarters also have organizations. There are no fewer than twenty or thirty such organizations in the entire county. Therefore, the atmosphere of national salvation propaganda is particularly strong in Jinhua today. They not only work in the county, but also spread propaganda in various parts of eastern Zhejiang. Undoubtedly, Jinhua is an active center in eastern Zhejiang. The most prosperous section of the city, from West Market Street to Lotus Well, is also full of a new atmosphere. The county has more than 60,000 able-bodied men. All men of military age, regardless of class, must be organized and trained, and the results are excellent. Every morning and evening, there are groups of trained able-bodied men drilling under the leadership of instructors in the suburbs. According to the reporter, the able-bodied men in each team are neatly dressed and move quickly. It is worth mentioning that, in view of the importance of grain storage during wartime and to adjust grain prices, the Jinhua County Government authorities have recently built a grain storage warehouse and two agricultural and poultry warehouses in addition to the old warehouses, which can normally hold more than 9,000 dan of grain. There is also a new-style warehouse with an area of 7.3 mu, which can also be completed in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Scenic Area</p>
<p>Jinhua has Beishan Mountain, whose range comes from Dabayan Mountain in Dongyang County, winding and undulating for more than 40 kilometers. Famous scholars of past dynasties have admired it and many have lived in seclusion here to study. Therefore, the historical sites and scenic spots of Jinhua Mountain are scattered everywhere. The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously designated this as a scenic area, and the Beishan Highway was built for this purpose. The reporter admired its scenic spots and walked from the west gate of Jinhua along the Beishan Highway. After fifteen li, he reached Luodian, and then circled along the mountain path for three li to reach Shuanglong Cave and Binghu Cave. Because it was very cold at the time, he could not enter the cave. He only hired someone from Shuanglong Tea Shop to guide him around the area for a week. It was a pity that he did not see the crystal curtain of the Binghu Cave's stunning scenery.</p>
<p>Lanxi</p>
<p>From Jinhua to Lanxi, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has the Jinhua-Lanxi branch line, which can be reached in only two hours. Lanxi used to belong to Jinhua Prefecture, but it was abolished as a county after the Republic of China. In the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Government designated it as an experimental county. After several years of hard work, each township in Lanxi County has a good organization and order. Lanxi is a large city with hundreds of thousands of people. In addition to the county seat, Youbu, Zhuge, Yongchang, Nubu, and other places are very lively market towns. Each town is connected to the county seat by highway bus, and it is also an important place in eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Establishing an Alcohol Factory</p>
<p>Lanxi is the hub of the Wu, Qu, and Yong three ports. The county seat is located at the junction of the three ports. Therefore, Zhejiang's commerce is centered on Ningbo along the coast, Hangzhou in the interior, and Lanxi for freight transportation in the canal region of eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, due to the war-time environment, Lanxi is not only an important place for waterway transportation in various places, but also a collection point for commerce in eastern Zhejiang today, making it even more prosperous. Lanxi County's annual agricultural output is more than 2.6 million dan, with sugarcane as the most important product, with an annual output of about 160,000. There are also handicrafts such as papermaking, oil extraction, tobacco silk, sugar, ham, and livestock. In terms of industry, there are also several factories. Recently, people from Jinhua and Lanxi jointly established an alcohol factory. It is said that the quality of the products is good, and this newly emerging industrial undertaking is also worthy of our attention. (The End)</p>

<h3>China's Unification - Retrospect and Recent Developments</h3>
<p>- By Mao Na, Representative of the International Anti-Aggression League</p>
<p>In 1932, Sukorski published a book entitled "Asia's Tinderbox," in which he said on page 52:</p>
<p>"China's previous history of internal strife has not been a pleasant thing to look back on. Individually, the Chinese are a lovely people; as a group, they are in a state of anarchy and disorganization in the current situation."</p>
<p>Mr. Su's readers call him the author who knows the Chinese situation best, so his words are worthy of attention. On page 293, he also said:</p>
<p>"Internal wars and revolutions, China will have several more years, which can be said to be a natural and immutable public opinion. In China, internal wars have become commonplace, and people are not surprised. Through this way, China slightly changes its political and social system."</p>
<p>On pages 317 to 318, it is further said:</p>
<p>"China's constantly unchanged internal wars promote foreign aggression and the danger of disintegration. Perhaps the Chinese do not know it, but the internal wars will continue."</p>
<p>Japan painstakingly prepared to invade China, split China, and annex China. Sukorski saw these step-by-step plans clearly. The foreign troubles were so serious, but China's civil war continued for four years after 1932 until it suddenly stopped at the end of 1936. The first half of the following year (1937) can be said to be China's model year. Why? Please see the writings of the American Commercial Counselor, Mr. Bret:</p>
<p>"China's financial stability has been maintained, and there has been progress in the unification of the currency system. ...The harvest of rice, the output of tung oil and cotton are all very good. In mid-July 1937, in general, things were more optimistic and exciting than at any time in previous years."</p>
<p>In addition to the items listed on the right, there is an even more important fact: for the first time in Chinese history, she could borrow money from the West in the summer of 1937 without collateral. But then the Japanese came, and the notorious July 7th Incident broke out!</p>
<p>But this is not surprising. In 1931, the opportunity for China's revival once came, because at that time, the League of Nations prepared a large-scale and multi-faceted aid program to China, which was about to be implemented. However, Japan seized this important opportunity and quickly used the Nakamura Incident as an excuse to attack Shenyang and seize Manchuria in order to destroy it.</p>
<p>At the end of 1936, the Communist Party and the Central Government no longer fought. The last of the groups that could not cooperate in the past were also gone, and China was about to be unified. However, eight months later, Japan came again and did another big thing. This time, it was not occupying Manchuria but advancing into North China. The devil's hand stretched into the interior of China. At this time, China had no civil war. Did Japan advance because of China's civil war and need to maintain order? Or was it afraid of greater rebellion against the Central Government? Although these excuses could not be found, Japan also rushed to attack, regardless of everything. With such aggression, China naturally had to rise up and resist. Seeing that it could no longer slowly nibble on the country, Japan changed its policy of gradual encroachment and even妄wanted to annex the whole of China. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Journey to Sui and Zao</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ya of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Victory is at Hand</p>
<p>In Xiangyang, I heard that the Division No. ×× had several vehicles to transport military supplies to Sui County. This county is a stronghold that threatens the × people to the northeast to protect Wuhan, and in the south, it shields an important battlefield for our resistance in central Hubei -- the opportunity was rare, so I went to contact them to hitch a ride for an inspection.</p>
<p>The vehicle was at Village ××, ×× li outside Fancheng, and we went there around 3 p.m. or so. Along the way, the setting sun was in the west, and military songs rose from all around, the sound waves were exciting and majestic, which made people excited. When we arrived, I contacted Mr. Wen, who was in charge, and he agreed to let me hitch a ride early the next morning. Mr. Wen also said that although the troops stationed in the surrounding countryside were far away from the city, each had a radio, so the news from all sides was not isolated. The number of our main force has now increased to more than 200 divisions, and all the old-fashioned guns have been replaced with new and sharp weapons. One-third of the strength is equipped for guerrilla warfare behind the ×, one-third is fighting on various battlefields, and the rest are stepping up training in the rear near the war zone. In short, all the strength of the war of resistance is stronger than in the first stage, and victory is at hand.</p>
<p>The Heroic Words of Honor Soldiers</p>
<p>The next morning, we took the car eastward from Fancheng. The weather was clear and pleasant, which made people more wary, fearing that enemy planes would come to welcome us. After passing Zhangjia Village and Shuangdian, everything was still peaceful. When we were about to reach Zao Yang, we suddenly saw large groups of soldiers marching on foot on the road. We saw rabbits and deer in the wheat fields and bushes, and everyone scattered to hunt them. The driver knew what was going on and stopped the car to tell us to disperse. At that time, the bells in the wild villages were ringing very urgently, and soon we saw enemy planes circling in the sky.</p>
<p>Several soldiers insisted on leaving, saying that it was just an unimportant reconnaissance plane. The officer did not allow them to move, saying that the sound of the plane was very heavy and turbid, and he was afraid that there would be other bombers coming. So they impatiently lay down on the grass again.</p>
<p>"Comrades! You are truly admirable, your injuries have just healed and you are going to bravely step onto the front line again." I already knew that they were brothers of the Honor Brigade.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? We are very ashamed that we didn't drive away the Japanese invaders and we were wounded. Damn it! Now it's finally better, and we're really happy to be back on the front line. This time, we will definitely kill all the Japanese, or we will fight to the death on the front line -- I've been wounded twice, and I'm too embarrassed to come down with injuries again this time."</p>
<p>"...We don't hold guns and do the same as you, that's really..."</p>
<p>"You're too kind!" Another brother immediately jumped in and said, "Now fighting a war, the front and the rear are equally important. If there are no people working hard in the rear, helping the front line in combat, such as stretcher transport, construction, etc., we can't win by ourselves."</p>
<p>"Yes," the one who spoke to me earlier said again, "What's more, now that we are fighting a war, soldiers and civilians should be as one. Soldiers are the people, and the people are the soldiers. If we love each other and work together, we can drive away the Japanese."</p>
<p>They also told me, "When we were fighting in Shanghai, the Air Defense Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs issued gas masks, which were well-made, durable, and beautiful, each costing about 16 yuan in national currency. Unfortunately, some brothers were not used to using them. They thought they were cumbersome to carry, so they casually discarded them or removed the glass parts and used them as dry food bags. But now everyone knows the stakes, and no matter what cruel weapons the Japanese use, everyone will be careful to guard against them." It can be seen that in the second phase of the war of resistance, the spirit and equipment of our frontline soldiers have made great progress compared with the first phase.</p>
<p>Towns are More Prosperous Than Cities</p>
<p>The air raid alert was lifted, and we continued to advance. We only knew that the enemy planes had bombed and wreaked havoc in the city when we passed Zao Yang Station. Along the main roads, there were old and newly built bunkers. There were especially many from Zao Yang to Sui County. Many mountain villages and fortresses had been planned early and well-prepared for emergencies. Folk weapons in Sui and Zao counties total more than ten thousand rifles. There are also the Huangdao Society, the Big Knife Society, and the Red Spear Society, which were all the rage for a time. They use common weapons such as broadswords, spears, and long guns, which have not yet been included in the statistics. Their latent power in the Henan-Hubei border area is very large, and they have been reorganized into the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Guards, led by the county government, to assist the army and participate in guerrilla warfare. Other formal guerrilla teams under the command of the Guerrilla Headquarters in the Henan-Hubei border area and the Guerrilla Headquarters in northern Hubei have a political foundation, strong cadres, and good discipline, just like the frontline resistance army.</p>
<p>The civilian houses, agencies, and even the city walls in Sui County have been changed from their old appearance. The collapsed and broken walls are covered with blood stains, all bearing the inevitable honorable wounds of national revival. This is not entirely due to the enemy planes' wanton destruction, because since the enemy army has been waiting across the Ze River south of the city since last winter, their artillery positions high on the Red Clay Mountain in eastern Hebei can bombard the city. But etiquette dictates reciprocity, and our artillery can also fire at the enemy artillery surveying stations from afar, repeatedly hitting their vital points, so the rumbling sound is intermittent.</p>
<p>The population in the city has been evacuated to the rear, especially the towns and cities in the four villages. Most of the commercial and economic agencies have moved west to Village ××. That night, we detoured from Sui County to Village ××, and it was already past 10 o'clock. At night, the lights in the town were like paintings, and the noise of people was boiling. They were still rushing to the night market. The prices of cloth, foreign goods, and Japanese goods transported from Wuhan were more than twice as low as in Xiangfan. In addition, many members of the political work teams of various divisions and regiments and the battlefield service corps gathered there to work, and they had the support of the excellent local farmers. Whether it was performing dramas and singing, organizing and training the masses, or escorting new recruits to the rear, the work could proceed smoothly and achieve great success. The good social order and the stability of the general public's hearts made people from the rear all the more praised.</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces is Almost Completely Destroyed, Silk Factories in Various Places Have Been Looted by the Japanese Side, and Silk is Collected at Low Prices, Sucking the Marrow and Blood of Our Farmers</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] In recent years, the silk industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been actively promoted by the government to improve production, and output has greatly increased, accounting for more than two-thirds of the country's total and a major part of foreign trade. Since the outbreak of the war and the fall of the two provinces, the silk industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been ravaged. The Japanese side is also carrying out economic aggression, plotting to plunder and control it. The silk industry has now been almost completely destroyed. The details are as follows after inquiring from various relevant parties:</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Have Abundant Silk Production</p>
<p>Due to the suitable climate and fertile land in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which are very suitable for the breeding of silkworms and mulberries, their output accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's total and occupies an important position in foreign trade. Since the Ministry of Industry of the government carefully planned and established silk districts in order to improve the silk industry and increase production in the 21st year of the Republic of China, it ordered improved silkworm species from the United States, established training institutes for silkworm rearing personnel, and organized large-scale silk factories. Production has made even greater progress. It can produce more than 3.5 million sheets of silkworm eggs and export more than 1 million dans of raw silk every year, breaking previous production records and laying the foundation for overseas markets.</p>
<p>After the Fall, It Was Tragically Ravaged</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance and the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the mulberry fields in various districts have been tragically ravaged, and the Japanese army has forcibly uprooted the mulberry seedlings, making the damage difficult to estimate. Later, in order to plot to plunder China's silk industry, the Japanese side sent Mukuno, Kubota Masashi, and Sase Akira, who were familiar with the situation in China, to various silkworm-producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to conduct surveys. Suzuki Kakuzaburo, a former employee of Mitsui &amp; Co., colluded with the traitor Zhang Zizhen and others, and organized the "Huiming Company" in Wuxi last summer, merging the original Heyan, Zhenyi, Anyu, Fulun, Zhenyuan and other silk factories, with a total of more than 2,000 silk factories. The capital was set at 50 million, with Hoshi Chuyu, a Japanese, as the manager, and Zhang Zizhen as the assistant manager. The source of its raw materials is all forcibly seized from the people in various districts, or forced to buy at low prices. All silkworm cocoons are also looted. Therefore, the company has only been in operation for a few months by the end of last year, but it has made a huge profit of more than 2 million. In fact, it is all the marrow and blood of the silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>China Central Company Plots to Control</p>
<p>The "Huiming Company" was reorganized into the "China Central Silk Company" after August last year, and intensified its aggressive conspiracy, hoping to implement control of the silk industry in Central China, and formulated various plans to manage silkworm eggs and mulberry fields. Starting from January this year, the fake "China Central Company" has put forward the following conditions to various seedbeds: (1) The company must send one Japanese manager to each seedbed to stay there permanently and manage everything, and the salary is borne by the seedbed; (2) The silkworm eggs are distributed by the company, and must not be reproduced or distributed; (3) The silkworm eggs are purchased by the company; (4) Half of the payment for the eggs is paid first when the eggs are made, and the rest depends on the silkworm harvest; (5) The company has the right to modify the regulations at any time. The above measures have been repeatedly convened by the Japanese side to hold meetings for various seedbed owners, but because the general seedbed owners are well aware of the righteous cause and are motivated by patriotic indignation and are unwilling to be slaughtered by them, they have refused to participate. Therefore, this conspiracy of the Japanese side has not yet been fully implemented.</p>
<p>Only Small Silk Factories Remain in the Interior</p>
<p>Under the heavy pressure of the Japanese side on the silk production of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the larger silk factories originally opened in Hang, Jia, Hu, Xi, and Chang and other places have been looted. However, the Japanese side does not attach importance to small silk factories with ten or twenty silk machines. Therefore, some silk industry personnel and farmers have scraped together a small amount of capital to purchase several silk machines and set up small silk factories in various villages. Because the processing fees are low, they can still make a slight profit. Those with more capital have moved to the Shanghai concession and set up factories to start work. According to the survey, there are 37 silk factories in Shanghai, including Yihe Silk Factory, Shanghai Silk Factory, and Tongren Silk Factory, with a total of more than 6,000 silk machines. Currently, the overseas Chinese market price is 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per dan, so the business of each factory is still going well. Since the establishment of the "China Central Company", the source of raw materials will become a problem in the future.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Europe is Increasingly Urgent, Romania Prepares for Protection, and Peaceful Countries Cooperate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 18th] After Romania refused the economic ultimatum proposed by Germany, and seeing the serious situation, King Carol of Romania quickly convened a royal conference last night. The leaders of the Romanian army attended the meeting. The meeting expressed satisfaction with the diplomatic and military steps taken by the authorities, believing that they were sufficient to guarantee the integrity of Romanian territory. As a result, a "sacred union" similar to that of France in 1914 appeared, bringing together leaders from all factions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 18th] Official sources have confirmed that the Romanian authorities have recently taken "certain steps" to defend the country's borders, but said that these steps are of a "peacetime" nature. It is also said that Romanian soldiers have not crossed the border, and the army has not been mobilized. According to another official report, the economic delegation of Sweden (led by Mr. Huldah) is conducting commercial negotiations in Romania, which will end in two days. The negotiations are continuing in accordance with the commercial agreement between Germany and Romania in November last year. The purpose is to exchange certain products.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Today, the official announcement of the German-Romanian economic negotiations: "The German-Romanian economic negotiations are held in Rome. The situation is still normal. The subject of the negotiations and the problems of this kind of negotiation are nothing special. What is discussed is how to increase the exchange of goods, etc. If there is anything beyond this scope, as reported by the British press, it can be regarded as an act of deliberately strengthening the international tension and spreading malicious air. From this, it can be seen that the so-called German ultimatum to Romania is completely unfounded."</p>
<p>British Cabinet Meets to Review the Overall Situation</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The British Cabinet held a cabinet meeting at 5 p.m. this afternoon. All cabinet members attended except for Simmonds, who was on a nautical vacation, and Hoare, who was unable to attend due to stomach problems. It is heard that the overall situation has been reviewed. Hundreds of people gathered on Downing Street to await news, which required the deployment of additional police to maintain order. This shows the attention of the general public. It has not yet been decided when to hold another cabinet meeting, but the Prime Minister will remain in the city this weekend to maintain contact.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 18th] The inner pavilion held an important meeting in the afternoon to discuss the situation in Europe, which lasted until 7:25 p.m. Prime Minister Chamberlain rushed back from the city of Birmingham to preside over the meeting. All cabinet members attended except for Privy Counselor Simmonds, who is currently traveling abroad. Olsen, the leader of the Conservative Party in the Lower House, was also invited to participate. Although the cabinet may not meet tomorrow, Prime Minister Chamberlain has asked all cabinet members to stay in the capital so that meetings can be held at any time. The Prime Minister himself will also suspend the usual weekend vacation and stay at home. The Imperial Defense Committee held a meeting before the cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Eden and Foreign Secretary Halifax had a meeting for 20 minutes before the cabinet meeting today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, "Foreign Secretary Halifax received the ambassadors of France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Germany today to discuss the situation caused by Germany's economic demands on Romania and Romania's request for guarantees from Britain. The Romanian ambassador, Tilia, visited Halifax last night to inform him of the note presented by Germany to Romania and to state the importance of Anglo-Romanian relations. Romania has decided to resist with all its strength any German or other territorial aggression. When the information about the German military mobilization spread throughout London, London immediately denied it completely, with the intention of making Germany change its attitude. Recalling the Czech incident in September last year, Germany made a similar request to Hungary, namely, Hungary should maintain its agricultural status and limit the number of its troops. From this, it can be seen that Germany has already involved Hungary in its economic sphere of influence and knows its limited military strength. Now, it is making further preparations to control Romania from an economic and political perspective. After Halifax discussed with the representatives of various countries this morning, it can be used as a reference when the cabinet meeting is held this afternoon to discuss the attitude of the Central State. Although the German side strongly stated that the German ambassador's visit to the Foreign Secretary was a diplomatic custom, Halifax took this opportunity to repeatedly express to the German ambassador that Britain still could not regard Germany's forcible occupation of Czechoslovakia as a legitimate act."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 18th] Foreign Minister Bonnet received Romanian Ambassador Tilia, British Ambassador Phipps, and Soviet Ambassador Surits this afternoon to discuss the situation in Europe. His meeting with the Romanian Ambassador lasted for more than an hour. The ambassador immediately stated that the rumors that the Romanian army had been mobilized and that Germany had issued an ultimatum to Romania were all unfounded. In addition, British Ambassador Sir Phipps had a brief conversation with Prime Minister Daladier in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union Will Adopt a Common Policy</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Today, the newspapers here are publishing the news that Romania is seeking help from Britain regarding Germany's economic ultimatum and its possible consequences. The general readers have learned of the crisis in Europe from the newspapers. The newspapers are also discussing the unity and cooperation of several countries in a prominent position, saying that a group has been formed, led by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and supported by Poland, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. According to some diplomatic correspondents, the British cabinet meeting last night discussed this proposal, but since it needs to be discussed with the autonomous region, there is no decision yet. It is also widely rumored that peaceful countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union will hold a meeting to adopt a common and consistent policy. What actions the countries will take in the future are still unknown. It is generally believed that Hitler and his close advisors gathered in Vienna last night to hold a meeting, keeping their future actions strictly secret. However, the people everywhere know that German troops are currently advancing eastward, and the destination is unknown. According to a Times reporter in Warsaw, Poland and Hungary have a common border, and Germany can use this to reach Romania. Poland and Hungary have begun military and political negotiations. According to a report from a certain place, the general staff of Poland and Romania will begin negotiations today. In addition, the Times reporter learned that the Romanian ambassador here, Tilia, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax on Friday and said that the 44th German Division (half in Czechoslovakia and the other half mobilized in Germany) is currently preparing to advance eastward. The reporter also said that Romania believes that even if Germany intends to attack Romania, it will not be able to do anything within ten days.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 19th] British Autonomous Region Minister Inskipp notified the governors of South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia yesterday afternoon of the British government's attitude towards the situation in Central Europe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] All sectors in Britain recognize that the situation in Central Europe may become more severe after Germany made economic demands on Romania. However, there is no expression of panic here. The stock market has also stabilized after Chamberlain's speech, and all sectors are increasingly convinced that Britain will take a tougher stance. However, Britain will carefully avoid getting involved in the war unless its main interests are directly harmed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Tonight, the newspapers here are using Romania's construction of national defense as the main headline. Although Romanian officials have denied mobilization, the foreign editor of the "Standard Evening News" published that Romania has indeed ordered the mobilization of five military regiments, and said that King Carol has expressed to the British government that if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can strongly assist, he can guarantee to attract Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia to form a united front and cooperate.</p>
<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union Will Begin Political Cooperation, Hudsons Arrives in Warsaw Last Night, Britain and Poland Discuss Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 18th] The Times published an article commenting on the importance of Commerce Minister Hudson's planned visits to Warsaw, Moscow, and the capitals of Northern Europe, saying that economic cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union is getting closer, which is also the beginning of political cooperation between the two countries. Hudson will go directly to Warsaw and Moscow without stopping in the German capital. According to news from Warsaw, the Polish side attaches great importance to it. Hudson left Britain today and will arrive in Poland on the evening of the 19th. Hudson and his party will meet Gu Huajin, Laikeer, and Kehan in Beijing. After arriving in Poland, Hudson will separately visit Minister of Industry and Commerce Roman, Foreign Minister Colonel Burke, and Finance Minister Jiaduofuya, and sign the guest book in the palace. The purpose of the talks in Warsaw is to make economic cooperation between Britain and Poland closer. It is heard that the Polish side is most concerned about seeking the assistance of British financial resources to develop the automobile industry. Another more important issue is the development of the Vistula River and the full improvement of the ports in the inland of Pilan. Poland will seek a loan of 100 million Polish coins from Britain and give Poland the convenience of purchasing a large amount of raw materials. The departure of the British commercial delegation has caused great diplomatic activity among the countries of the Baltic Sea. According to a "Jiebao" report from Beijing, the Polish Minister to Kaunas (Lithuanian capital) visited the Prime Minister of Lithuania yesterday. At the same time, the Polish Minister to Latvia also met with the Latvian Foreign Minister. According to political sources here, when the Lithuanian Foreign Minister returns to his country from Italy via Berlin, he will also meet with the Nazis.</p>
<h3>It is rumored that Hitler Advised the Italian Prime Minister Not to Impose on France and Somalia Temporarily</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] After Sweden annexed Czechoslovakia, the attitudes of Hungary and Italy are still unclear. It is also unknown what new moves Germany may take in the future. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Observer" said that Hitler has stated to Mussolini that he should not make any territorial demands on France at present, but can make demands regarding Tunisia, so that he can apply the method of Hitler's seizure of the Sudetenland in the future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 19th] Italian newspapers have resumed their attacks on France today, saying that the authorities in Tunisia have treated Italians improperly. The newspapers report that 1,500 Italian overseas Chinese in Tunisia have decided to return to their country within this week.</p>
<h3>The United States Implements Economic Pressure on Germany, Levies Additional Taxes on German Goods Immediately, and Will Announce the Exchange of Documents between the United States and Germany</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] The Treasury Department announced that starting from March 23, an additional tax of 25% will be levied on imported German goods. Responsible officials here recently elaborated that this move is actually the first step in the United States taking an offensive against the German economy. US trade has fallen sharply since the President canceled the most-favored-nation treatment for Germany last year, and will almost completely stop thereafter. US business circles originally planned to exchange goods with Germany, but now there is no way to realize it. The blow to German trade will inevitably be more serious.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Undersecretary of State Welles said today that the U.S. Department of State is prepared to announce the exchange of official documents between the U.S. and Germany to clarify the U.S.'s position. The U.S.'s notification of Germany's launch of a political coup in Central Europe was sent out last night in a reply. The U.S. Department of State expects to decide on the future status of the current Minister to Czechoslovakia within a few days.</p>
<h3>Pittman to Propose New Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will propose a new neutrality bill to the Senate on the 20th, advocating the repeal of the current neutrality law and authorizing the President to: (1) designate belligerents within 30 days of the outbreak of war; (2) prohibit American merchant ships from carrying any goods to the designated belligerent countries; (3) allow belligerent countries to purchase various items, including armaments, from the United States, but only for cash and self-transportation; (4) prohibit lending credit to belligerent countries; (5) exempt American countries that do not participate in the war in the Americas from the above provisions.</p>
<h3>Benes to Organize Provisional Government in the US</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Los Angeles, 10th] According to the Czech consul here, former Czech President Dr. Benes will soon announce the formation of a provisional government in the United States.</p>
<h3>Hitler Arrives in Berlin, German Troops Advance East from Prague, Hungarian Troops Occupy Ruthenia, Germany Expresses Willingness to Recognize</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 19th] Official sources report that Hitler is scheduled to return to Berlin at 6:30 PM tonight.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Hitler appeared on the balcony of a hotel in Linz today, where he was greeted with cheers from the crowd. He then toured the area in a military vehicle and visited several new factories. Therefore, his return to Berlin has been postponed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 18th] Most of the German troops have left Prague, reportedly moving eastward. Prague is calm today, with no mechanized units moving through the streets and traffic flowing freely. However, planes have been circling overhead all day, creating a constant rumble.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 19th] According to reports from Bratislava, the German section of the Slovak Ministry of Education has decided that the education of Slovak children must be conducted in the spirit of the Nazi Party from now on. From May onwards, teachers must be Aryan, portraits of Hitler must be hung in all schools, and the Nazi salute must be enforced.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hungary, 18th] Hungarian troops have completely occupied Ruthenia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sighetu Marmatiei, Romania, 18th] Today, near Borsa, Ruthenia, fierce fighting broke out between Ukrainians and Hungarian troops. The Ukrainian guard units put up strong resistance, forcing the Hungarians to quickly send reinforcements from Rakhiv until 4:30 AM. The guard units have been repelled, and 350 of them fled into Romania. Many Ruthenian cabinet members, along with their families, have left for Zagreb to meet with Prime Minister Volosin. They will then go to Vienna, where the Ukrainian propaganda department is located, which is the center of the Ukrainian independence movement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 18th] Well-informed sources here have recently stated that the German government has informed Hungary that it is willing to recognize the annexation of Ruthenia.</p>
<h3>British Military Aircraft Crashes, Four Killed</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 19th] A British military aircraft crashed near Glasgow yesterday, killing four people.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Paris, 19th] It has been learned that the Soviet ambassador, Surits, still refuses to hand over the property of the former Czech embassy to the German embassy. The French government will remain silent on this matter.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Protests to Germany, Does Not Recognize Annexation of Czech Republic, Promises Aid to Romania if Invaded, Germany Rejects French Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov has protested to Germany that the Soviet Union cannot recognize Germany's seizure of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] The Soviet Union remains silent on Germany's pressure on Romania, awaiting official information. However, this silence does not mean that the Soviet authorities are not deeply concerned about their most dangerous enemy, Germany, getting closer to its borders. Well-informed sources believe that if Romania's integrity is threatened, the Soviet Union's interests in Ukraine will be greatly affected, and strong measures will inevitably be taken. These strong measures may be similar to those taken against China. The Soviet Union established friendly relations with China and has provided material assistance to China since Japan's invasion of China. In view of Stalin's speech at the Communist Party Congress on the 10th of this month, recognizing that Germany's outward expansion is westward, Germany's actions may surprise the Soviet Union. However, since the Munich Conference, the division of Czechoslovakia has long been anticipated. Another passage from Stalin's speech is also important: "We are willing to help countries that are invaded and fighting for independence."</p>
<h3>Fall of Czechoslovakia Shocks Switzerland, President Etter Broadcasts, Resolves to Uphold Freedom and Independence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bern, Switzerland, 18th] Swiss President Etter said in a broadcast today that Switzerland is shocked by the fall of Czechoslovakia. Although the Swiss people declare their rights and obligations of neutrality, they are determined to uphold freedom and independence at any cost.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Pretoria, South Africa, 18th] It has been learned from official sources that the South African authorities canceled police leave this weekend and ordered reservists to report, reportedly in response to the Czech incident.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Officials announced that Germany has informed the British and French ambassadors that the government considers the protests from the two countries to be completely lacking in political, legal, and moral basis, and therefore refuses to accept them.</p>
<h3>Henderson Returns to England, French Ambassador Also to Return Home, Germany Recalls Ambassador to England</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] British Ambassador Henderson looked unusually cheerful when he left Germany for England tonight. Embassy staff went to the port to see him off, but no German officials were present, proving that Henderson's return was completely unofficial. French Ambassador Coulondre will return to France on Monday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] German Ambassador to England Dirksen has been ordered to return home for consultations.</p>
<h3>France Intensifies Preparations, Chamber of Deputies Grants Premier Special Powers, Newspapers Comment on Significant Meaning</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Official sources report that after the Senate approved the Daladier plenary powers bill, the cabinet will hold a meeting this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The Chamber of Deputies passed the Premier plenary powers bill by a vote of 321 to 264. An amendment proposed by former cabinet member Monnet was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 313 to 262.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The Chamber of Deputies has approved in principle the bill granting special powers to the government. Daladier will use his special powers to abolish the 40-hour work week system, obtain mandatory increased credit security, and extend military service from two to three years.</p>
<p>Daladier: Defend the Borders</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] The Senate Finance Committee passed the Daladier plenary powers bill this morning, with only two dissenting votes. Daladier said, "The seriousness of the foreign situation makes it extremely reasonable for me to make this request. I must be able to take immediate military and economic steps to defend our country's borders." It is generally believed that the important steps are: (1) increasing the number of troops; (2) increasing arms production; (3) stockpiling raw materials; (4) giving priority to the military nature of privately funded industries; (5) establishing new industries and their financial management; (6) revising laws so that the government can requisition labor and buildings in wartime; (7) increasing working hours in private industries related to arms manufacturing.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Paris, 18th] According to comments in Parisian newspapers, the recent events in Central Europe have greatly shaken the French government. The fact that the Chamber of Deputies Finance Committee was able to pass the Daladier authorization bill by a vote of 26 to 10 is of great significance. The government is currently seeking full powers to increase the country's military strength. The Prime Minister's current plan is to concentrate on eliminating the 40-hour work week system in the arms industry. Although the government's issue of confidence with the Chamber of Deputies has been severely hit, it is heard that the current cabinet will still be unanimously supported when the meeting is held this afternoon. The "Matin" newspaper commented that since the Prague incident, France must intensify preparations and strengthen unity. French fascist leader Rocque published an article in the "Petit Journal," demanding the election of a true French leader and the establishment of a new government on a broad basis.</p>
<h3>US Army Begins Recruitment Drive, Training Young Pilots</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The US Army today began a large-scale nationwide recruitment drive to train young pilots and supplement the congressional bill to increase the Army by 3,000 aircraft. The military will send commissioners to various universities to examine and recruit graduates in June to participate in training.</p>
<h3>Suicide Cases Increasing in Prague, Thanks to Hitler!</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 19th] Suicide cases are increasing here. Renowned surgeon Miel and his wife committed suicide by taking poison after learning of the German invasion of the city. Twenty Jews were sent to the hospital after attempting suicide, including a High Court judge and a former bank manager. Another person committed suicide by jumping from the roof of the radio station building.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Line of Peace</h3>
<p>After Germany once again broke its promises and annexed the Czech Republic, the situation in Europe has become more serious and critical. The democratic and peaceful countries are also facing increasing difficulties and dangers. Therefore, news of the great unity of democratic countries and the strengthening of the line of peace has repeatedly appeared in the newspapers. Among the most noteworthy facts are:</p>
<p>1.  The United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union have successively declared that they will not recognize Germany's illegal annexation of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>2.  The US government formally sent a note on the 19th pointing out Germany's actions, and the US Treasury Department also announced an increase in import duties on German goods.</p>
<p>3.  Diplomatic circles in London criticized Chamberlain's policy on the 19th as a complete failure.</p>
<p>4.  The London Times commented on the 18th on the importance of Commerce Minister Hudson's plan to visit Warsaw, Moscow, and the capitals of Northern Europe, pointing out that closer Anglo-Soviet economic cooperation is the beginning of Anglo-Soviet political cooperation.</p>
<p>5.  The French President is scheduled to visit the United States on the 21st to meet with Roosevelt to discuss the unity of democratic countries. We cannot yet fully trust the power of the peace front today, and we cannot help but feel that it is too late. However, if we simultaneously observe the aggressive group's appearance of strength but internal weakness, and simultaneously observe that the broad masses of people in democratic and peaceful countries who seek freedom and the broad masses of oppressed people around the world will unanimously strive to support the peace front, then success or failure will be known without waiting for the alarm. I sincerely hope that my compatriots in our country who are bravely resisting the war will each make greater efforts!</p>
<h3>Germany Continues Eastern Aggression!</h3>
<p>After occupying Czechoslovakia, the German aggressors are now actively preparing to continue their eastward aggression. A large number of German troops have left Prague and are moving east, with Romania and Yugoslavia as potential targets. Romania has already begun mobilization to prepare for resistance and has requested assistance from the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. According to observations from prominent newspapers in London (including The Times), Hitler's ambition is insatiable. After one success, he immediately makes a second advance. It is especially noteworthy that the target of the German invasion today is not the often-propagated invasion of Soviet Russia, but rather a move towards the southeast, attempting to create a Germany that dominates the Mediterranean and Central Europe! This should especially serve as a warning to democratic and peaceful countries. We must especially point out here that, first, due to the internal difficulties and crises of the aggressors themselves, they do not yet have the courage to immediately invade the powerful Soviet Union; second, the aggressors' future ambitions are no longer to redistribute colonies, but to re-divide Europe. After several small and weak nations are conquered, their blade will be directed towards the capitalist democracies that have previously assisted the aggressors with their policy of compromise!</p>
<h3>Congratulations to the New Writing Society</h3>
<p>Although the Latinized New Writing is only an attempt in China to eliminate illiteracy and develop a mass culture, experimental results from various parties have shown that it is more complete than past Romanized spelling methods, and it is an easier-to-teach, easier-to-learn, and easier-to-use tool. The Central Propaganda Department praised it last year, and the experimental results in Shanghai and other valleys were especially satisfactory. In the past, enthusiastic people in Hong Kong have worked hard to promote it, but it has long lacked a complete plan. Furthermore, it has been viewed with suspicion by some people. It has not achieved the results it should have. It is now learned that the Hong Kong government has approved the registration of the New Writing Society, and the inaugural meeting is being prepared. It has also been decided to open more day and night classes for enrollment. While we are pleased, we hope that the association can stand on a purely academic and literary research position to develop the mass culture, and that the media should work to serve the people and promote culture. Do your best to help each other.</p>
<h3>After the Partition of Czechoslovakia, Will Germany and Hungary Reach a Compromise? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Dong Pingduo</p>
<p>The Inside Story of Hungary's Seizure of Ruthenia</p>
<p>Here, Hungary should be mentioned. She will never forget that today's Carpatho-Ukraine is her former territory. This is the reason for her military advance and forceful occupation and joint division. Moreover, she, like Germany, is adept at promoting secret struggles.</p>
<p>Because in recent years, German-Hungarian relations have been very close, so everyone is embarrassed to publicly break faces. Both sides are secretly mobilizing troops and generals, and fighting each other with a heart of balance.</p>
<p>In Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungary has also long ago set up her spy network. A few years ago, in Vienna, I met an unusually famous Czech journalist whose title was the editor-in-chief of the Ruthenian "Truth Newspaper." He often traveled to Vienna. Later, I learned that he was actually the mastermind of the Ukrainian independence movement, highly respected by the Ukrainian people. He had tried his best to promote the idea of a Greater Ukrainian independence within Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union. If Ukraine were to truly declare independence, he would definitely be the first Prime Minister. His name was Bai Luodi.</p>
<p>Later, I met him again. One day, I was walking with him on the streets of Vienna when suddenly he said, "Excuse me," and walked away. I saw him enter the Hungarian embassy.</p>
<p>Soon, I fully understood that Bai Luodi and the Hungarian embassy, moreover as expected, that was extremely important.</p>
<p>After the Munich Agreement, Ruthenia formally became the Carpatho-Ukraine Autonomous Region within Czechoslovakia, and its first Prime Minister was none other than Bai Luodi.</p>
<p>Bai Luodi ran to Prague to meet with the then Czech Prime Minister, the one-eyed General Sirovy. He suddenly made an astonishing request: for the Carpatho-Ukrainians to hold a referendum to decide the fate of their country themselves. Undoubtedly, the result of this referendum would not help Czechoslovakia but would instead help Hungary.</p>
<p>Sirovy was furious and jumped up, calling Bai Luodi a traitor to Czechoslovakia: "Get out of here and never let me see you again!"</p>
<p>Bai Luodi returned to Khust, where he immediately discovered that he had been dismissed from his post. His successor, Volosin, was an orthodox cleric.</p>
<p>When Hitler heard the news of Bai Luodi's unreasonable demands, he immediately ordered his secret police to search for all information and materials about Bai Luodi. They rushed to Vienna and thoroughly searched Bai Luodi's residence, eventually finding a piece of evidence: a signed agreement between Bai Luodi and the Hungarian government. In it, Bai Luodi agreed to hand over Carpatho-Ukraine to Hungary. His reward was 600,000 yuan, two fiefs, and the title of Baron.</p>
<p>So, Hitler sent this evidence to the Czech government, which immediately ordered Bai Luodi's arrest. The next morning, among the planes taking off from the newly built airport in Khust, one carried the first Prime Minister of Carpatho-Ukraine, now as a prisoner, to Prague.</p>
<p>Bai Luodi was accused of treason, disloyalty, and corruption and was prepared to be sentenced to a severe punishment. Germany repeatedly exerted pressure from behind, demanding that Bai Luodi be executed. However, by Christmas, Bai Luodi had been released.</p>
<p>So now it is time to pay attention to the successor, Volosin. He is a Catholic missionary. In Carpatho-Ukraine, few people other than priests can read and write, so it is not surprising that a missionary official is appointed as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Although Volosin had no reputation before the Munich Agreement, he rose to high office in one step. He is now a key figure in the current new crisis in Europe.</p>
<p>Volosin's goal is to do his best to establish the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine. This is exactly what Hitler approved and deeply encouraged.</p>
<p>The Hungarian government naturally does not agree with this. Not long ago, the Hungarian people paraded and demonstrated on the streets of Khust, and their attitude was extremely excited, often making demands. Finally, this time, they took advantage of the fire to rob, marched in and occupied the entire Carpatho-Ukraine, finally fulfilling their long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>But things are definitely not that simple. Although everything seems to have come to an end and is peaceful, Hitler will never generously give away a piece of land that he has worked so hard to cultivate for many years. What's more, with this piece of land as a pillar, there is a more distant goal - to seize the rich Soviet Ukraine - to achieve!</p>
<p>Hitler will not be too quiet. Wait. In that small place, it will eventually be a source of international news.</p>

<h3>Japanese Goods Flood Hong Kong, European and American Goods Suffer a Major Blow, Japanese Goods Worth 6-7 Million Dollars Sold Last Summer and Autumn Alone, European and American Merchants Urging Payment for Sales Sites, Over 20 Million Dollars Owed</h3>
<p>Hong Kong is the general distribution center for goods in and out of southern China. Since Guangzhou and Wuhan fell last year, various transportation lines have been controlled by Japan, and the transportation of various goods has been difficult. At the same time, Japan has monopolized the markets in the occupied areas, so 98% of European and American goods have been occupied by Japan. Hong Kong's trade has suffered enormous losses, estimated at over 20 million dollars. It has been found that in addition to being transported to the mainland, Japanese goods also take advantage of Hong Kong's free business operations and use Hong Kong as a distribution center. Taking textiles as an example, annual sales in Hong Kong can reach 6-7 million dollars. The business situation of the entire textile industry in Hong Kong in the past year is investigated below. The textile industry in Hong Kong has always had a textile association. It has been found that there are about 120 stores in Hong Kong engaged in this industry, but only 40 have registered to join the association. Those who have not joined exceed half, amounting to about 60-70 stores. Their business nature also varies. All members of the textile association are deeply aware of the importance of opposing Japan and resisting Japan and do not sell Japanese goods. In order to make it easier for customers to identify them, they publicly hang the association certificate in front of the store to show that they are different from those who operate Japanese goods. The quantity of domestic goods they sell is larger than that of European and American goods. It has been found that in the past year, the market for European and American goods in Hong Kong was about 1 million dollars in the summer and over 3 million dollars in the autumn, while the sales of Japanese goods reached 6-7 million dollars in the summer and autumn combined. From this alone, the extent to which Hong Kong is flooded with Japanese textiles can be seen. As for European and American textiles transferred from Hong Kong to our country, the numbers were also considerable when Wuhan and Guangzhou were lost, totaling around 1 million to 1.8 million dollars. Now, only Macau and Guangzhou are left. Furthermore, it has been found that because the domestic market has been lost, the import of European and American goods has greatly decreased. It is estimated that the orders for European and American goods in the summer and autumn have decreased by about 25% to 30%, amounting to 1.5 million to 2 million dollars. Secondly, the market for Japanese goods in Hong Kong is increasing day by day. In total, Japanese goods have occupied about 20 million dollars of the textile market for European and American goods in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Abolishing Old Nickel Coins, Implementation Rescheduled for Next Month</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities, in view of the excessive complexity of circulating currencies and the mixing in of counterfeit coins, which greatly inconvenienced merchants and residents, have ordered the casting of new nickel coins in England in preparation for the conversion. It was originally planned to implement this after the Lunar New Year, but the Financial Secretary, Mr. Philip Haddon-Cave, felt that the current situation was too critical and he had no time for this. The implementation has been postponed to about a month later, at which time a public announcement will be made to inform the public. However, before the announcement to abolish the nickel coins, all nickel coins will continue to be valid as usual.</p>
<h3>Ma Tau Chung Public Housing Formally Opened Yesterday: Residents Must Meet Two Conditions</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, considering that Hong Kong has little land and a large population, and that refugees are constantly arriving, and that ordinary buildings are already full, has built forty units of public housing in Ma Tau Chung for the purpose of rescuing those who are living on the streets and those with relatively low living standards. These units will be rented out at the lowest possible rent to allow ordinary people to live there. The facilities include electric lights, water pipes, and hygiene equipment, and they were officially opened yesterday, the 19th. Currently, nearly three hundred people have registered to rent. However, the rental requirements are somewhat restrictive. Residents must have a legitimate occupation in Hong Kong and be affected by the wartime situation and housing problems. Among the three hundred-odd registered applicants, there are not many who meet the above conditions.</p>
<h3>Four Robbers with Weapons Rob a Cargo Boat Off the Coast of Tsz Wan: 200 Yuan Worth of Goods Stolen, Boat Driven Away</h3>
<p>Cargo boat No. T-115, owned by Chen Lai (45 years old) from Taiping Village, Dongguan, was carrying a large quantity of timber, bamboo silk, bed frames and other goods from Taiping Village to Hong Kong on the morning of the 18th of this month. At about 5:00 p.m. that afternoon, when it sailed to the sea off Tsz Wan, a pirate boat suddenly approached head-on. There were four pirates on the boat, two with rifles and two with Mauser rifles. As soon as they got close, they ordered Chen's boat to stop. Seeing that the pirates all had guns, Chen and his crew had no choice but to stop moving forward. The pirate boat then docked alongside the cargo boat. Two pirates with rifles jumped onto the cargo boat and threatened Chen and his crew to steer the boat along with them. After the two pirates returned to the pirate boat, Chen and his crew turned the boat around and headed straight for the shore. The pirates, seeing that Chen and his crew had disobeyed, opened fire. Chen and his crew immediately jumped into the water and swam to shore to escape. Then, they saw the pirates dragging the cargo boat south. Chen and his crew had to walk to Hong Kong and arrived yesterday afternoon, and immediately went to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station to report the case. The cargo boat was worth 100 silver dollars, and the goods were worth 200 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Britain Determined Not to Give Up Rights, Striving for Navigation Rights on the Pearl River: The Jinshan Steamer Will Now Operate Passenger and Cargo Services</h3>
<p>Foreign Vessels Remaining in Guangdong Still Have No News of Returning to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Jinshan steamer has sailed to Guangzhou for the third time. The first two times were for carrying food to supply foreigners on Shamian, so it only carried a small number of passengers. It was not until the third time that the number of passengers increased slightly. Now, the shipping company has decided to send a vessel back and forth every two weeks to carry passengers and cargo. According to reporters, the Jinshan steamer's resumption of service between "Guangdong" and Hong Kong is purely to fight for navigation rights on the Pearl River, to prevent the [enemy] from using Britain's abandonment as an excuse to block the waterway and achieve their sinister plan. Regarding the formal opening of the waterway, the British side is still negotiating with the [enemy], and the outcome is still unpredictable. As for the foreign vessels remaining in Guangdong, they are currently still in the river in Guangdong and there is no news of their return to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Five Hand Grenades Discovered in Yau Ma Tei Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Placed in the Stairwell of a House on Shanghai Street: A Large Number of Detectives Dispatched for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>At about 1:00 a.m. yesterday, Cheung Ming, a detective from the Mong Kok Chinese Detective Team, was patrolling near No. 613 Shanghai Street when he discovered a cigarette box placed at the entrance of the stairwell. Since it was right at the entrance of the stairs, it seemed to have been stored there by someone else. So, he stepped forward and inspected it with a flashlight. Unexpectedly, when he opened the box, he was shocked to find five hand grenades inside. Detective Cheung believed that the grenades were dangerous items and dared not move them rashly. So, he blew his whistle to summon his colleagues to the scene to monitor, and then telegraphed back to the Mong Kok Police Station to report. The duty assistant officer, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives and a general assistant officer to the scene to investigate. Everyone believed that the grenades were dangerous and feared that an accident would occur, so they still dared not move them. They telegraphed back to the Hong Kong Central Police Station to report. After receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched an assistant officer from the Ordnance Examination Department, accompanied by various key figures, to the discovery site to examine. It was not until about 2:00 a.m. yesterday that the five hand grenades were taken back to the police station. At the same time, an emergency order was issued, ordering police officers to set out overnight to conduct a thorough search in various places for suspicious persons. As a result, the streets adjacent to the area were in a state of martial law. Anyone coming and going who looked suspicious was immediately searched, but no results were obtained. The police are paying special attention to this hand grenade case and are determined to thoroughly investigate the owner of the grenades in order to reveal the truth.</p>

<h3>New Look of the Orphanage Sponsored by the Hong Kong Emergency Relief Committee Branch: A Conversation with Director He Zehong Who Arrived in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>"Mom! I'm hungry!" After the calamity in Huizhou, such cries can be heard everywhere!</p>
<p>"After a washing, there is no money to send to Chinese schools! Only a few schools can resume classes—so they have to wander around to survive, running down the road to depravity day by day!"</p>
<p>——After the calamity in Huizhou, such scenes can also be seen everywhere—the disaster area ravaged by the [enemy] is painful—but the abandonment and lack of education of the little masters who will inherit our generation makes us heartbroken—and worried about the future of the nation!</p>
<p>After the recovery of Huizhou, some kind people who "love the young as their own" have privately donated money to entrust the towns and villages to manage the education and upbringing of orphans. However, the number of people accommodated is very small, and they tend to passively raise them, neglecting active education. The Huizhou branch of the Hong Kong Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, in the spirit of compassion, extended a helping hand to help the children in the disaster area. It has first established an orphanage in Huiyang, with the aim of combining "education" and "raising." Orphans admitted to the school are not only exempted from all tuition and miscellaneous fees, but also provided with two meals a day by the orphanage. Taking on the task of educating and raising orphans in the recovered occupied areas is, needless to say, an urgent need, and contains far-reaching significance.</p>
<p>In the devastated occupied areas, orphans crying for food heard this good news. In Huiyang City alone, 981 orphans immediately flocked to them. The association only allocated 1,600 yuan per month, which could only accommodate 300 people. After examinations and reviews, 683 people were rejected! This is not without regret!</p>
<p>The selection criteria are orphans with higher intelligence and academic ability who have suffered the most robbery. Applicants are eager to be on the list. Most of them are junior high school students applying for senior high school, and senior high school students applying for junior high school. The "struggle and suffering of the students, I wonder how the extravagant compatriots in Hong Kong would feel after hearing it!</p>
<p>The orphanage is located in the Huiyang Xiushui Lake County Women's Normal School, which is a good environment for educating children. The director, He Zehong, and the deputy director, Liu Yaozi, are both young people who are serious about their work. One appeals for help from the outside, and the other specializes in educational affairs internally. The two cooperate with each other and complement each other. The teachers only receive a living allowance of 20 yuan per month, and their spirit of serving the children is also admirable. The class system is divided into six classes from the first to the sixth grade, with 50 people in each class, like a complete elementary school. The organization of the orphanage is divided into educational affairs, training, and general affairs departments under the director and deputy director, which is similar to the administration of a general elementary school. As for the curriculum, it is slightly different from that of a general elementary school. The orphanage offers six subjects: 1. Mandarin (including the Three Principles of the People), 2. Wartime Knowledge, 3. Spiritual Speeches, 4. Current Affairs Explanation, 5. Simple Crafts, and 6. Physical Education (including national defense games).</p>
<p>It is very difficult to implement wartime child education in the recovered occupied areas. Therefore, the colleagues of the orphanage have agreed to mutually encourage each other: 1. Enduring hardship without complaint; 2. Being tireless in teaching; 3. Working hard for the cause and work; 4. Being loyal to education; 5. Creating benefits for orphans. - This is naturally a heartfelt attitude to life.</p>
<p>As for the principles of teaching, they are: 1. Taking doing as the center; 2. Taking initiative and self-motivation as the learning principle; 3. Taking collective self-education as the educational indicator; 4. Adapting to the needs of the War of Resistance and children. This is also a new aspect of wartime children's education. Their daily life starts with morning exercises at dawn. In the beginning, the order and hygiene of the 300-strong "mixed force" were problematic. After a week of training, it immediately showed a neat, serious, lively, and intense atmosphere. When lining up to eat in the canteen, the order is very good, like a children's army (as shown in the picture). Bowls and chopsticks are brought from home by each person, which is the only smile of the parents in their worried faces.</p>
<p>There are three characteristics in their entire life: (1) The curriculum is as much as possible in line with the War of Resistance, and after accepting the lessons of occupation, every child has a high degree of national awareness; (2) Simple crafts, focusing on production training, hiring skilled talents to train various small handicrafts, and now there are successive products such as woven bamboo baskets, chicken cages, and bamboo baskets for daily use (as shown in the picture). The manufacture of ink and fragrant paste is also being planned; (3) In terms of group activities, there are small group discussions and collective criticisms every day. This group of innocent and lively little masters is also using songs, dramas, propaganda... to promote the reconstruction of their homeland and the upsurge of common hatred for the enemy in Huizhou after the calamity. They are truly a group growing up in hardship. The reporter was deeply moved when listening to Mr. He's report and seeing their photos, and became more convinced of the greatness of the latent national power.</p>
<p>The orphanage was originally scheduled to operate on a trial basis for one month, which expired on the 12th of this month. After Director He's painstaking management and appeals in all directions, it has been decided to continue to operate for four months with the support of charitable organizations. The children and their parents are deeply grateful for their kindness.</p>
<p>Director He believes that it is also necessary to quickly establish orphanages in various rural areas after the calamity, such as Ping Mountain and Danshui. Therefore, he came to Hong Kong again to request assistance from the Emergency Refugee Relief Committee and Mr. Xu Shiying. The progress was quite smooth, and he will return to Huizhou during the day to continue his work.</p>
<p>Director He, in order to make the teaching staff of the orphanage sound and to take on the great task of training young national heroes, will use the name of the Huiyang County Party Department - he himself is the Secretary-General of the County Party Department - to set up a social service worker training class, recruit high school graduates to enter the class for training, which is scheduled to open on the 25th of this month, so that they will be assigned to various rural areas in the future to serve as teachers in orphanages and handle social services, becoming cadres of the lower-level organization. The national spirit of the post-calamity is gradually reviving. I sincerely hope that those who have money will enthusiastically donate money, and those who have the ability will work hard in earnest! So that the people can be comforted; so that the [enemy] can be warned!</p>

<h3>After Visiting the "Dog" Exhibition First Discovered in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Leisurely Pastime of the Bourgeoisie</p>
<p>In the morning, before eleven o'clock, luxurious cars appeared one after another in front of St. John's Square on Garden Road. Chinese and foreign men and women got out of the cars, joyfully and proudly dragging or holding their beloved dogs, as close as a loving mother taking her child for a walk outside; this kind of enjoyment, this kind of tenderness, makes some people who see it inevitably feel a little "inferior to dogs"!</p>
<p>A dog show is still a first in Hong Kong. The new thing has attracted many curious spectators. A one-dollar ticket cannot be said to be cheap, but the proceeds from this exhibition will be entirely allocated to the Hong Kong Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for expenses. Although it is a narrow charitable cause, it is much better than a simple exhibition for profit.</p>
<p>The types of dogs participating can be roughly divided into four types: (A) Hunting Dogs: (1) Hounds (hunting dogs), which include eighteen types such as Afghan hounds, Finnish hounds, and Irish hounds; (2) Hunting dogs, divided into fifteen types; (3) Hounds, divided into ten types. (B) Non-Hunting Dogs: divided into twenty-four types such as wolfhounds, Chinese dogs, bull dogs, and St. Bernards. (C) Toy Dogs: divided into eleven types such as Pekingese and small dogs. (D) Others, including six types. The total number of dogs participating is 115, several of which were absent due to circumstances. In addition, there were fourteen cats on display in the field. Several of the female dogs in the field also brought their newly born puppies. According to their owners, they would not agree if the puppies were left at home. The dog owners or the male and female workers hired to serve them all sat with the dogs on display, constantly feeding them food or water, brushing their fur with brushes, and using silver combs to fluff up the fur to increase their beauty. The venue also displays dog food, such as biscuits; dog medicines, such as egg exterminating lotion; the completeness of food and utensils is admirable. If the packaging instructions are removed, who would know that this is specially for dogs to enjoy?</p>
<p>There are really many kinds of dogs displayed at the venue. Unfortunately, the reporter is not a dog breeding expert, so I cannot introduce them to the readers in detail. It is really a pity. All I can see is the difference in size. Many of them I have never seen before, which is really an eye-opener. In my opinion, each one has the qualification to be a champion. The small ones, such as Pekingese and small dogs, weigh about four or five pounds; the large ones, such as Danish dogs and St. Bernard dogs, generally weigh more than seventy or eighty pounds. The psychology of dog owners varies from person to person. Women mostly prefer petite and exquisite toy dogs, while men prefer large dogs. Naturally, there are exceptions. However, raising large dogs is quite expensive. Take the two St. Bernard dogs sent by the famous wealthy businessman Yu Dongxuan as an example. They have only been out for less than a year and are called "puppies," but they have grown almost as big as calves. It is said that these "puppies" that are less than one year old have a very good appetite and need at least one pound of beef and one pound of biscuits a day to fill their stomachs. His family also has older St. Bernard dogs, and their appetite is much greater than these "puppies." From this, we can know that raising dogs is not an easy pastime!</p>
<p>The judges worked hard from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, except for a short break for lunch, classifying and judging the merits of each. Each dog that wins the first prize in each category is given a blue ribbon by the exhibition, with the word "Champion" written on it, with a certificate stating the type of dog, the owner's surname, and a silver cup. The dog that wins the second prize receives a red ribbon and a certificate; the dog that wins the third prize receives a green ribbon and a certificate; and the dog that wins the finalist award receives a white ribbon and a certificate. When the Governor's wife presented the awards, the owners were naturally overjoyed. The dogs held "or dragged" by their owners seemed to have a little bit of humanity and proudly wished to be proud, which is "a hundred times the price after climbing the dragon gate"!</p>
<p>After the awards, the dog show was declared closed. The successful people and dogs, the frustrated people and dogs, and the calm people who came to see the excitement left the exhibition hall in the midst of the noisy human voices and the barking of pigs and dogs. St. John's Square also returned to its original tranquility. (New)</p>

<h3>Situation in Various Parts of Guangdong: Shengang [Enemy] Surrounded by Our Forces; [Enemy]'s Main Force Gathers at Taiping Field; [Enemy]'s Military Actions Still Focus on Hainan Island: At Most, They Are Nothing More Than Harassment</h3>
<p>[Fast Report from the North River] The [enemy] forces on the east, west and north lines of Guangdong Province have been busy deploying recently, showing signs of activity. However, in reality, it is more of a smokescreen. Observing their military actions, they still focus on Hainan Island, with the main objective of occupying the entire island. On other lines, they are currently adopting a defensive posture. Here is a report on the recent situation in the North River area:</p>
<p>[Enemy]'s Main Force Gathers at Taiping Field</p>
<p>According to a military report from the front line between Conghua and Huaxian, there are currently about 4,000 [enemy] troops, with the main force gathered at Taiping and Xin Street, to prevent our troops from advancing from Guizui Street to Ping Mountain. The remaining strongholds at Shengang, Luotan, Hengtan, Longkou, Xiaobu, Xiangshan, and Shijiao each have between three hundred and three hundred [enemy] troops. The [enemy] troops in the above-mentioned places occasionally come out to harass the villages, but they retreat quickly and do not dare to take large-scale actions. It can be seen that the [enemy] troops are still in a defensive phase, and it seems that there is no plan to continue advancing northward on a large scale in the short term.</p>
<p>The [Enemy] at Shengang Surrounded by Our Forces</p>
<p>It has been found that our army took advantage of the [enemy]'s retreat on the night of the 4th and launched an attack on Shengang's Xiagang Ridge. With one vigorous advance, they captured the stronghold of Xiagang. After our army captured Xiagang Ridge, they completed their replenishment and immediately advanced towards Shengang. According to a military report from the front line fifteen days ago, a certain unit of our army had approached the area at 5:00 am that morning and had a fierce battle with an [enemy] battalion. Until dawn, our army automatically withdrew according to the original plan. It is estimated that many [enemy] troops were killed in this battle, and our side also suffered some casualties. It has been found that our army has now coordinated with a certain unit of the 2nd District guerrillas to surround and control the [enemy] troops at Shengang. It should not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The [Enemy] Troops at Guanyao Actively Building Defenses</p>
<p>The [enemy] troops entrenched at Guanyao Fengyong have been forcibly dragging our people to build a highway from Guanyao to Yaobian for days. 200+ [enemy] soldiers drove dozens of transport vehicles and drove from Fengyong to the villages near Tanbu Wuhe to collect a large amount of fir wood and various building wood on a daily basis. For several days, they have also forcibly dragged 1-400+ civilians to use transport vehicles to transport materials to the Tanbu line to build defensive works, day and night without stopping. The busy situation is unprecedented. Looking at the dynamics of the [enemy] troops on all lines, they are still actively engaged in the deployment of defensive works. At most, they are nothing more than harassment.</p>
<h3>A Certain Military Officer Speaks: It's Easy to Invade Guangxi; We Have the Best Defense; Roads in the War Zone are Being Actively Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Correspondence] Recently, the enemy troops have been frequently mobilizing, seemingly with the intention of invading Guangxi. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet a certain staff officer at a road defense post. When asked about the enemy's recent attempts to invade Guangxi, he discussed the matter in detail as follows: (The following is the account of a certain staff officer.)</p>
<p>In recent days, the enemy troops have been using the captured Hainan Island as a military base and have been dispatching troops to attempt to invade Guangxi. One route is via Huaiji, another via Wuzhou, another via Lianzhou, and another via Shangsi. The enemy has no chance of succeeding on any of these three routes, but the Beihai route deserves close attention.</p>
<p>Although the enemy is trying to use troops in the southern route, our military authorities have long made full preparations. Now, we are further studying the situation from all aspects as follows:</p>
<p>1.  To spy on Wuzhou along the Xijiang River is the supreme shortcut for the enemy to invade Guangxi. However, our army, guarding this line, numbers over 100,000. The enemy dares not launch a frontal attack and pay a heavy price. Moreover, west of Zhaoqing, the blockade line along the river is heavily guarded, especially the Langjiang Dam in Jilongzhou, which stretches for ten miles and can never be breached by the enemy's shallow-water ships.</p>
<p>2.  Using the navy to take the route through the Gulf of Tonkin, landing at Beihai, passing through (Hepu) Qinzhou, Xixiang, Yongning, and Longzhou, cutting off Sino-Vietnamese communications, and hindering our international transport. Then, following the extension of the Xiang-Gui Railway, emerging from Liuzhou, and attacking Guilin from the rear. This line is the most noticeable to the general public. However, according to those familiar with the terrain there, Beihai has a lot of sand and shallow water. It is difficult for the enemy's larger warships to approach the shore, and it is especially difficult to land troops with heavy weapons. Moreover, west of Qinlian, there are tens of thousands of people acting as a natural barrier, and the enemy's mechanized units will definitely have difficulty advancing. Our national defense works along the line have been nearly completed, and certain elite divisions are stationed there.</p>
<p>3.  If using the navy, landing near Guangzhou (eastern coast of the Leizhou Peninsula), and invading westward along the highway, passing through Rongxian to attack Cangwu from the rear, our side has not only dispatched heavy troops to garrison there, but also thoroughly destroyed all highways south of Yulin. Furthermore, there is the natural barrier of the Goulou Mountain Range, and the Shiwan Mountains, both of which are praised by Chairman Chiang as favorable terrain.</p>
<p>4.  Using the army, advancing northwest from Sanshui, passing through Sihui and Guangning along the Suijiang River, entering the Guangxi territory of Huaiji, and then heading straight for Kaijian to attack Cangwu. However, the highways along the line have been destroyed by us, and there is also the Mengling Mountain Range, which the enemy troops cannot cross.</p>
<p>According to estimates by several strategists, the general public believes that the enemy will use its main force to attack Beihai, and use the Xijiang River as a supporting attack. However, the enemy's strategy is the opposite. After all, the Xijiang River is indeed a shortcut, but the distance between it and the Beihai landing is vast.</p>
<p>At present, the roads in the war zone of Guangdong Province are being actively destroyed, but unfortunately, many are not thoroughly destroyed. The roads in Guangxi Province close to the war zone are being thoroughly destroyed or turned into agricultural swamps by various methods, making it difficult for the enemy to use them and hindering the development of their mechanized units.</p>
<p>In short, in terms of geographical conditions, we are already absolutely in a superior position. Moreover, the enemy's troop strength is consistently insufficient, preventing them from launching large-scale offensives. Therefore, the enemy's invasion of Guangxi, no matter which route they take, will be difficult to find any development.</p>
<h3>Reviving Commerce: Huiyang Provides Loans, Temporarily Allocating 70,000 National Currency; Loan Standards are Divided into Three Grades</h3>
<p>[Huiyang Correspondence] After the incident in Southern China, Huiyang was the first to be ravaged. The core commercial districts were all reduced to ashes. Although it was recaptured in winter, the heavy losses in all aspects made it difficult for shops to resume business, and unemployment was extremely widespread. The Guangdong Relief Huiyang Branch has specially decided to petition the government authorities to launch a movement to revive commerce in Huiyang and provide loans to rescue merchants. The initial loan amount is temporarily set at 70,000 national currency, which will be launched in the short term. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Loan Use: The loan is interest-free and is used to subsidize the simple construction of destroyed shops and restore commerce.</p>
<p>2.  Loan Scope: Limited to destroyed shops in cities and market towns under Huiyang County. First, it will be launched in Huizhou City, followed by market towns.</p>
<p>3.  Loan Amount: A total of 320 shops were destroyed in Huiyang. The amount is temporarily set at 70,000 national currency. The amounts for other market towns will be determined separately with reference to these measures.</p>
<p>4.  Loan Standards: Divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Construction costs of 800 national currency or more are Grade A, 400 national currency or more are Grade B, and 200 national currency or more are Grade C. Grade A loans are 300 national currency, Grade B loans are 200 national currency, and Grade C loans are 100 national currency.</p>
<p>5.  Construction Responsibility: The destroyed shops will first be constructed by the shop owners with loans. If they do not build, they will be constructed by the branch with loans. If they still do not build, they will be built by this branch. However, for those built by this branch, the branch will rent them out, and the annual rental income, after deducting the loan repayment, will be returned to the shop owner.</p>
<p>6.  Determining Rental Amounts: For shop owners who borrow loans or do not borrow loans but build, if the monthly rent is less than 8 yuan, the original rent will be charged. If it is less than 12 yuan, 90% of the rent will be charged. If it is less than 20 yuan, 80% of the rent will be charged. If it is more than 20 yuan, 70% of the rent will be charged, in order to help the merchants. If the shop tenants borrow loans to build, 50% of the original rent will be charged. However, the original shop tenants of the constructed shops should have priority in renting.</p>
<p>7.  Loan Repayment Schedule: The borrowers will repay one-tenth of the loan annually, to be fully repaid in ten years.</p>
<p>8.  Lease Term: From the date of lease, the landlord shall not increase the rent within ten years.</p>
<p>9.  Those who have agreed upon the construction between the landlord and tenant are not subject to these restrictions.</p>
<h3>Wu Jufang Ordered to Rescue Guangdong Refugee Children; Establishing Nurseries to Accommodate Refugee Children; Also Including Children of Soldiers on Expedition</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express News] Wu Jufang, standing committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee, returned to Shaoguan from Chongqing. The reporter made a special visit to inquire about everything. According to Wu, regarding the various relief plans, she met with Madame Chiang in Chongqing and received instructions, distinguishing between urgent and less urgent matters for implementation. Madame Chiang paid special attention to the issue of wartime children's care and emphasized that rescuing children in war zones was the most urgent task.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Chinese Wartime Children's Relief Association was relocated to Guangning after the fall of Guangzhou and subsequently dissolved, except for the Hong Kong branch which accommodated some refugee children, the provincial branch has not yet been restored. Madame Chiang instructed that children's rescue work should be prioritized, and various measures have been finalized to be swiftly implemented upon returning to Guangdong.</p>
<p>It has been decided to first rescue and then accommodate, with personnel dispatched from the provincial government, the New Life Movement, and the provincial relief committee to various war zones and near occupied areas to quickly rescue children. Initially, a temporary nursery will be established in Shaoguan, followed by six nurseries in various regions of the province to accommodate as many as possible. In addition to refugee children, children of soldiers and laborers on expedition will also be accommodated to alleviate the educational burden and concerns of frontline soldiers and to assist the government in wartime education responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Guanshan Market; Enemy Troops Harass</h3>
<p>It has been found that on the 12th and 13th of this month, the enemy troops who attacked Guanshan Market, also divided part of their force, over 120 people, and harassed villages around Lizhi Garden, Huaxia, Baihe, Lin Village, and Caowei, forcing the villagers to organize local puppet maintenance associations and elect village and town chiefs. At the same time, they also ordered merchants in Minle City to pay 100 yuan in military supplies every day, or pay with food and livestock; otherwise, they would be "severely punished."</p>
<p>Currently, the people in that area are under this oppressive force, extremely frightened. The young and strong are fleeing to find refuge, the scene is desolate, and the situation is tragic.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops in Sanshui Forcibly Recruit People to Participate in the So-Called "Sino-Japanese Friendship Gathering"; Deploying a Poisonous Policy of Appeasement in Occupied Areas; Many Soldiers in the Enemy's Itata Unit are Anti-War</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Express News] Recently, the enemy in the Xijiang River area has been actively implementing an appeasement policy in the occupied areas, trying to lure the people in our occupied areas and implement a poisonous policy of using Chinese to control Chinese. In recent days, so-called "Sino-Japanese Friendship Gatherings" have been held in various parts of Sanshui. It has been found that the enemy in Xin Market held gatherings at the Xiafenghuangshan Village for two consecutive days on the 12th of this month, forcing villagers to participate, with all kinds of threats, saying that those who did not go would be suspected of other intentions and would be arrested by soldiers. The villagers, being under the sphere of influence, had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p>Moreover, the enemy in Ge Wei comes and goes from time to time. On the 12th, their numbers increased to more than 300 people. At about 3 pm on the 13th, more than 200 people returned to Hekou. Currently, there are still more than 100 people stationed in the village.</p>
<p>It is now known that the enemy troops in Sanshui have recently increased to more than 4,000, but they are there for relief purposes. At the moment, the enemy troops are in the middle of an exchange. It has been found that the enemy troops in Sanshui a few weeks ago were the Itata Unit, but because many soldiers in that unit were anti-war and there was a trend of instability, the enemy commander, An Teng, reassigned the Zhongyuan Brigade to relieve them in Sanshui. It has been found that the commander of the Zhongyuan Brigade arrived at Hekou on the 15th. The enemy headquarters is still located at the customs. At the moment, the enemy's entire Xijiang military affairs have been reassigned under the command of the Zhongyuan Unit.</p>
<h3>...Shipping News Special...</h3>
<p>The Italian Postal Steamer Company's Xieli wheel, arrived in Hong Kong from Europe via Xiaoluzon at 6:00 AM yesterday, carrying 180 Jewish people transiting through Hong Kong. It departed for Shanghai on the same ship at 1:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>The Zhaming Steamboat Company's Xiansheng wheel, which is now docked at the Kowloon port, will soon be dismantled and sold. Because the wheel has been in operation for 34 years and there is no possibility of repairing the various parts, the company has specially decided to scrap it. The original Tawau route will reportedly be replaced by the Hulujia wheel.</p>
<p>The Zhushidan wheel, represented by the Most Time Foreign Company, arrived in Hong Kong from Xiaoluzon late last night and is currently docked at the Kowloon Warehouse. It is scheduled to depart for Japan and Shanghai and other places at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>The Thai Sheng Company's Haojiang wheel is scheduled to leave the dock tomorrow, and will resume its regular service between Hong Kong and Macau the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Zhongshan During the War</h3>
<p>— Huang Wenkai</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent for This Newspaper) In the twenty months since the start of the War of Resistance, Zhongshan has long been coveted by the enemy. The enemy planes' bombing and the enemy ships' circling reconnaissance have occurred countless times, but each time, the dangers have been overcome with composure. At the same time, Zhongshan's resistance strength has grown in this difficult environment. The current situation is clearly a significant improvement from the initial stage. Before the enemy troops began their invasion of South China, it was generally estimated that the enemy's invasion route might be through Tangjiawan, which belongs to Zhongshan, because at that time, quite a few enemy ships had gathered in Tangjiawan. Logically speaking, Zhongshan also faced a great danger.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese finally landed in Daya Bay. After the fall of Guangzhou, they advanced along the Xijiang River. Although Zhongshan was not isolated, its contact with the inland was greatly affected, and its position became even more serious. In the current situation of the South China battlefield, it is worth considerable attention.</p>
<p>Improved Air Defense</p>
<p>Zhongshan's air raids were once as common as daily meals, causing alarm several times a day. In the hail of bombs, considerable losses were unavoidable. However, Zhongshan also gained valuable experience from this. During each air raid, Zhou Keming, the head of the transportation regiment, Zhou Shouheng, the director of the air defense office, and all the staff members were required to personally maintain order under the alarm. The rickshaw drivers, carpenters, blacksmiths, porters, and coolies under the transportation regiment's jurisdiction had the task of guiding people to shelters during air raids. Children and women on the streets were taken to air raid shelters by rickshaw drivers. Those inside houses were persuaded to enter air raid shelters by carpenters and blacksmiths. This planned evacuation was very effective. Although Shekki has also been subjected to many air raids recently, the casualties have not been as heavy as before, and only the civilian houses have suffered slight damage.</p>
<p>Shekki has many mountains, and the terrain is quite high. These natural terrains are used as natural air raid shelters. Although the enemy has consumed a lot of ammunition, they have rarely been able to achieve the goal of slaughtering our compatriots.</p>
<p>Food Problem</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem, it has become very serious recently in Zhongshan. Originally, Zhongshan County belonged to the rice-producing area. The amount of rice produced each year, in addition to meeting the needs of the county, could also be transported to neighboring areas to provide assistance. This time, a rice shortage suddenly broke out, which was truly unexpected. According to those familiar with the details, the main reason for the Zhongshan rice shortage is the concentration of hoarding by rice merchants.</p>
<p>It was originally difficult to strictly refuse to assist neighboring counties with grain. However, the rice in Zhongshan was ultimately limited. To supply the unlimited needs of neighboring counties with it was practically impossible. Recently, some rice merchants, because the prices in other counties are higher and there is a profit to be made, have disregarded everything and sold the rice secretly, thus forming the serious problem of a food panic in Zhongshan County today.</p>
<p>The reporter met Yuan Dai in the second district and casually talked to him about the food problem in Zhongshan. He said with some emotion, "Because of the war, many people in Zhongshan have moved to safe places. Due to the decrease in population, Zhongshan's food supply should have been more abundant. This rice shortage is naturally an unexpected event. However, one thing is most regrettable. As far as I know, some unscrupulous rice merchants have secretly sold stored rice to the enemy. Selling grain to the enemy is equivalent to increasing the enemy's strength. This cannot be ignored."</p>
<p>The Armed Forces of Zhongshan</p>
<p>As soon as you step into Zhongshan territory, you will feel that Zhongshan seems to be a county of soldiers. Coming and going are soldiers in military uniform, equipped with weapons. These soldiers are the self-defense forces. They are scattered throughout the districts, supporting the strength of the protracted resistance. Their weapons are self-provided, and their expenses are borne by the districts. This fully demonstrates the spirit of resistance of the people of Zhongshan.</p>
<p>One day, the reporter was talking about war issues with Deputy Officer Huang in a Zhongshan teahouse. He said frankly, "According to military theory, the enemy is clearly failing. First, sending troops on a long expedition is the most taboo thing in military operations. On the contrary, we can wait for the enemy to exhaust themselves and will inevitably achieve victory. Second, the most taboo thing in military operations is plundering, because soldiers should aim to fight, and they should not infringe on the people. The behavior of the enemy troops in the occupied areas is precisely a major mistake. Third, the thinness of the ranks is also a major weakness of the enemy troops. Fourth, the key to supporting the war is the economy. Japan's economy is gradually on the verge of collapse. Therefore, in our view, we are more certain of the ultimate victory."</p>
<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<h3>Introducing Several Stunt Doubles and Stand-Ins; The Work is Heavy and Unrecognized</h3>
<p>When every audience member, after appreciating a certain film, attributes the reason for the film's popularity to the acting skills of the male and female leads, although this viewpoint has its existing value, in fact, it is not absolutely correct. This is because there is also a group of behind-the-scenes heroes, such as directors, cinematographers, set designers, sound engineers, script supervisors, production assistants, prop masters, lighting directors, stunt doubles, and stand-ins, who also make great contributions to the success of each film. However, except for the directors and cinematographers, who may have the happiness of being admired, the hard work of other personnel is erased. The biggest reason, of course, is that they do not appear on the screen. Even the stunt doubles and stand-ins who have the opportunity to appear on the screen are often unable to get a word of praise, which seems even more unfair, especially since their work is more difficult and dangerous than that of the stars. However, in the Hollywood film city, there are many people engaged in this work of substituting for others, and they seem to enjoy it, because they all hold the hope that one day they can become big stars instead of being just the "stunt doubles" or "stand-ins" of film stars.</p>
<p>Serving as a film star's "stunt double" or "stand-in" is not an easy task. The prerequisite is to have the same figure, appearance, complexion, and height as the film star, because they have to represent the film stars in front of the camera for lighting or take on dangerous shots for the film stars. For example, when a passionate couple is kissing, the lighting is always handled by two "stand-ins" for the stars. Sometimes, for the sake of angle and lighting, they even have to kiss fifty or sixty times before the male and female stars themselves are allowed to perform the actual shot. Similarly, scenes such as a celebrity falling down the stairs or being attacked are not actually performed by the expensive film stars themselves, but by those unlucky "stunt doubles." In addition, if there is a scene that needs to be re-shot, but the protagonist has already left on a long trip, they have no choice but to have their "stand-in" take the shot. However, the audience below the screen thinks it is the film star himself. Almost all the big stars in Hollywood have their own "stunt doubles" and "stand-ins." Here, we briefly mention a few of them who are specifically big stars' "stunt doubles" or "stand-ins," and who make important contributions in the film process, but whose names are unknown.</p>
<p>Connie Lynn</p>
<p>Is Joan Blondell's "stunt double," a doll-like beauty with red hair and yellow eyes, a pure American girl, born in Los Angeles. Her original goal was to become a lawyer, but after studying at university for two years, she changed her mind and wanted to become an actress. Before becoming Joan's "stunt double," she also had some small stage experience, but she felt that her current job was the most suitable and could also gain some real skills. She accompanies Joan every day to rehearse, read scripts, and do movements. Whether in the studio or at home, Connie Lynn dresses the same as Joan Blondell, but she is a little shorter, so she wears higher heels to make up for the difference. Her current salary is fifty dollars a week. Connie is already married, and Joan Blondell was her bridesmaid at the wedding. Her husband is Dick Powell's manager.</p>
<p>Lee "Huck" Forest</p>
<p>Is Lee Strasberg Howard's "stunt double." This bachelor lives with his mother and sister and has studied business calculation and business management at Ohio and Southern California University. His idea of becoming Howard's "stunt double" is that he can see the real situation of film production and prepare a foundation for dedicating himself to the screen in the future. Lee Huck's entry into the film industry was very unexpected. It turned out that one night he went to a dance hall and met a director who said to Lee Huck, "Come to the studio to find me, I have work for you." At that time, Lee Huck did not expect to work in the film industry at all, so when he went to see the director a few days later, he was assigned to be Lee Strasberg's "stunt double." From Howard and Mona Loa's "Animal Kingdom," he has been working as his "stunt double." A "stunt double" must be very close to the star, so Lee Huck knows that Lee Strasberg is a thoroughly British man. He is the most interesting figure in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Tay Garnett</p>
<p>Six-foot-three and thin, he is also Gary Cooper's "stunt double" and "stand-in." They are old friends from the Montana ranch. Tay Garnett not only resembles Cooper in face and figure, but also in temperament and personality. He walks beautifully and is taciturn. He once enlisted as a soldier and was a pilot during the European War. Even now, he is still a member of the Aviation Association. Initially, he and Cooper entered the film industry together as extras, but due to the arrangement of fate, he can only be a "stunt double." When Cooper goes out hunting, he also has to go with him. This is the only thing they have in common today. Tay Garnett has a wish to join the Air Force in China and fight for human justice.</p>
<p>Don Miro</p>
<p>Fate, this illusory thing, is always playing tricks on people. Five years ago, two young people shared a room due to economic problems, and they even exchanged underwear and ties. These two people both had ambitions to enter the film industry. One of them was Don Miro, and the other was his "original self," the famous young man Robert Taylor. Four years ago, Taylor said to others that his good friend was Don. Although the environment has changed and he has become the number one superstar, he still regards Miro as his best friend. As proven by the facts, when Taylor went to England to shoot a film, the British government restricted him from bringing technical personnel with him and could only bring one friend, he did not go with Bai Beilan Stanfei, but went with Don Miro.</p>
<p>Ann Rutherford</p>
<p>She is Olivia de Havilland's "stand-in." The contract between Havilland and Warner Bros. stipulated her "stand-in." She lived with Havilland before Havilland entered the film industry. Ann regards Olivia as a leader, and Olivia treats Ann like a sister, always giving her expensive gifts on her birthday. Because of the relationship between "stand-in" and "original self," and because they have lived together for a long time, Ann knows everything about Havilland very well. She said, "Havilland is really troubled because she doesn't like to go out with a group of unsatisfactory boyfriends, so someone spread rumors that she has an arrogant temper, which makes Havilland have to go out with unsatisfactory men and women in order to please people." Ann came from Tennessee and majored in piano at Tennessee Women's College. Later, she came to Hollywood to be an extra, and was introduced by a staff member of the company's public relations department to be a Stock Girl, with a salary of only sixteen dollars a week. But after becoming Havilland's "stand-in," she had fifty dollars a week. When her "original self" misses a film, she often plays unimportant supporting roles in other films. Now she admits to being deeply attached to an important employee of Warner Bros. and will be getting married soon.</p>
<p>Mayer Morlay</p>
<p>Is Cary Grant's "stunt double" and "stand-in," a student at Case Western Reserve University. Before walking out of the campus and into the film city, he worked as a professional baseball player. Later, in a major competition, he broke his finger, so he had to end his life as an athlete and came to Hollywood to be Cary's "stand-in" and manage all his chores. In addition to the salary paid to him by the company, Cary himself also gave him the same compensation. This young man, who received double the salary, married a beautiful young lady from Los Angeles. Although he is only twenty-six years old this year, he is already the father of a four-year-old child. Some people weep sadly for his work as a "stunt double," but Mayer believes that it is of great help to his artistic cultivation. In his free time, he often studies scripts with Cary, Katharine Hepburn, and others, and has gained a lot of benefits. Recently, when Mayer went to the hospital to have his finger operated on, Cary paid for the medical expenses.</p>

<h3>International Tournament: England Eliminated, China Wins Championship Right, 4-1: China Wins After Initial Loss, Li Huitang Shows Sportsmanship</h3>
<p>[Report from our Correspondent] In yesterday afternoon's international football semi-final held in Jia Shan, as expected, the Chinese team eliminated the English team with a score of 4-1, securing the final. The entire match unfolded as follows: Less than five minutes after the start, the Chinese team conceded a goal, at which point the English team's momentum was at its peak, with more attacks than defense. The situation soon changed, and the Chinese team launched a fierce counterattack. However, Li Huitang's four brilliant shots were all thwarted by the goalkeeper, Hayle, unable to penetrate the net. This period was the most tense. Shortly after, Feng Jingxiang scored a goal for the Chinese team, retaliating in kind. From this point on, the Chinese team's turnaround from defeat to victory accelerated rapidly. As the first half drew to a close, the Chinese team was already leading 2-1, but the offensive momentum did not diminish. In front of the English goal, there were countless close calls. Hayle injured his left hand while saving Liang Rongzhao's powerful shot, fracturing two fingers. It is believed that he will not recover for at least half a month. After Hayle's injury, Li Zhaorong took the opportunity to score another goal, ending the first half with a score of 3-1. Changing sides for the second half, the Chinese team consistently held the advantage, but the English team resisted strongly, leading to a chaotic state. Later, Li Huitang scored another goal, sealing the victory at 4-1.</p>
<p>In this match, one event is most worthy of recording: Li Huitang's exemplary sportsmanship. Every move of his revealed this. In the second half, with Hayle injured and guarding the goal, the Chinese team launched frequent attacks. In theory, the Chinese team could have won by at least three or four goals. Especially with Li Huitang's several solo runs, and his confident shooting skills, it seemed that every shot would find its mark. However, seeing Hayle was injured, and knowing his team had a firm grip on victory, even though he had further opportunities to score, he did not want to take advantage of the situation and continued to approach the goal for several more shots, only lightly flicking the ball. General fans who did not understand his intentions thought his shots were weak. Little did they know the reason he did not shoot forcefully was not out of "false mercy," but rather to leave room, not wanting to subject the already injured Hayle to further pain. Therefore, Li Huitang's benevolent act was something no ordinary footballer could have achieved.</p>
<p>Regarding the Chinese team's performance, apart from Huang Jingcong, who was unremarkable, the rest were all competent. In terms of the front line, Li Huitang's successful central breakthroughs were thanks to Feng Jingxiang's accurate passes. Deng Guangsen's frequent movement also relied on Feng Jingxiang's supply. Li Zhaorong, knowing that the left wing was not useful, often used short triangular passes with Li Huitang and Feng Jingxiang. This tactic was a specialty of the Chinese team, and its proper execution in yesterday's match led to a great victory. As for the defense, the three midfielders were quite erratic in the first ten minutes, but later improved, with coordinated advances and retreats. The two inside backs, especially Hou Rongsheng, were particularly noticeable due to his excellent performance, earning praise from the spectators. Tan Jun'gan's several brilliant saves were a great contribution, especially his save of Duffy's excellent shot in the first half, which showed great skill. The English army's defeat was inherently limited by the degree of its technical skill, unable to compete with China for supremacy. However, the performance of its members was extremely dedicated. The former inside back was steadfast and firm. Only the members of the front line, except for Amberson who had a unique performance, played like midfielders, with poor passing and weak rushes.</p>
<p>Parker, rich in experience, used skill to overcome others, a performance that surprised us. Hayle, before his injury, also made many good plays. Geddes, who replaced Cole, was also adequate.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>(4 minutes) The Chinese team fought against the wind, with exceptional difficulty. English right-winger Marsh broke through during a fierce attack. The naturally gifted Jun'gan left the city to save, obstructed by the opposing forward. Fortunately, Rongsheng covered by himself, kicking the ball out of bounds, preferring to concede a corner kick. After the kick, the ball was again obtained by the English army and forced another corner kick. Duffy sent the ball out from the baseline. Amberson shot among the crowd, scoring a goal. (1-0)</p>
<p>(17 minutes) Li Huitang had four fierce shots, all saved by Hayle. Feng Jingxiang then opened up a new path, suddenly passing the ball to Zhaorong. Zhaorong was overjoyed and thought he could score with one shot, but unfortunately, he was judged offside and returned dejectedly.</p>
<p>(23 minutes) Liang Xiang moved quickly and transported the ball well. Li Huitang was able to break through the trenches and charge forward. Jingcong also took the opportunity to sneak into the enemy territory. Li Huitang, realizing the opportunity was unmissable, shot directly with force. The cannonball had just entered, but was caught again by Hayle.</p>
<p>(25 minutes) Rongzhao seized the ball from Erskin Landridge and passed it diagonally to Zhaorong. Zhaorong quickly sent it to Jingxiang. Jingxiang found an opportunity and shot hard. The speed was as fast as electricity. Hayle was unable to save it, and the score was tied at 1-1.</p>
<p>(30 minutes) Rongzhao received a pass from Jingcheng, looked left and right, and found that Li Huitang was standing in a safe zone. He immediately sent the ball over a long distance. Li Huitang skillfully passed Parker and went solo to the meeting. Geddes and Parker were unable to catch up. The English army lost ground again, and the score became 2-1. The Chinese army turned defeat into victory.</p>
<p>(35 minutes) Li Huitang and Rongzhao temporarily switched positions. Rongzhao, acting as center forward, showed off his skills, forcing his way into the shooting area during a fierce attack. The momentum was extremely strong. Hayle pushed the ball away with both hands. Parker quickly kicked it out of bounds, only conceding a corner kick. At this point, Hayle injured his finger while saving the ball. He bandaged it and continued to fight, but his performance was much worse than before.</p>
<p>(40 minutes) Zhaorong and Jingcong launched attacks on the left and right. Fei Shi and Wo Da suppressed the front. Zhaorong received Jingcong's help and sneaked in front of the goal, shooting the ball into the net, making the score 3-1.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>(10 minutes) The Chinese army moved to a new position, taking advantage of the favorable wind. The offensive momentum was very sharp, but because the English army's defense was tight, it was impossible to break through.</p>
<p>(15 minutes) The English army launched a counterattack, forcing three corner kicks in a row, and besieging the city. Jun, with a miraculous hand, saved the day. Rongsheng added a foot, and the English army retreated.</p>
<p>(32 minutes) The Chinese army attacked more than defended, and victory was in sight. Their skill was exceptional. Li Huitang received a wonderful pass from Huixiang and scored from a long distance, making the score 4-1, eliminating the English army and winning the right to the final. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Great China)</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan</p>
<p>Ji Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng, Liang Rong, Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Huang Jingcong, Li Zhaorong, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>(England)</p>
<p>Hayle</p>
<p>Parker, Tedi Leeds</p>
<p>Wei Jianchen, Bi Lidi, Feishi, Da</p>
<p>Defilo, Ershidu, Landridge, Chatelik, Moss, Amberson</p>

<h3>Men's Basketball Tournament: Group A Guangda Defeats Hong Kong University, Three More Games Tonight</h3>
<p>The public men's basketball tournament started at 3:30 PM yesterday. In the first game of Group B, Hongxing faced Chenguang. The strength of the two teams was not far apart, so the competition was fierce. In the first half, Hongxing led 18-13. Although Chenguang tried hard to counterattack in the second half, their skills were inferior, and as a result, they were defeated by Hongxing 29-44. In the second game of Group A, Hong Kong University faced Guangda. Although Hong Kong University has participated in previous competitions, their results have not been high. Although Guangda cannot be called a strong team in Group A, Chen Zhaolu, Lu Dong, Wu Xuanzhao, and others have considerable skills in shooting, guarding, and passing. Therefore, the strength of the two sides in this game was very different, and there was not much exciting performance. Guangda had been leading by a large margin from beginning to end. Although Zhang Shaomian and Xu Kunlun of Hong Kong University tried hard to counterattack, it did not help the overall situation.</p>
<p>After the opening, within a few minutes, Chen Zhaolu and Wu Xuanzhao of Guangdong successively shot baskets, creating a record of 10-0. Hong Kong University only managed to score two points through Xu Kunlun after several attacks. Soon, Chen Zhaolu of Guangdong showed his strength again, successively making the score 18-2 and 36-4. By the time Zhang Shaomian scored twice, Hong Kong University had already lost the first half 9-49. After changing sides and fighting again, Guangda's offensive was slightly weakened. Hong Kong University had a good momentum to reverse the decline. Unexpectedly, Lu Dong of Guangda showed his power again, creating records of 58-13 and 62-13. By the end of the game, Guangda won by a large margin of 80-17.</p>
<p>In the last game of Group B, Kangyuan faced Guangzhong. The two teams were evenly matched. Although Guangzhong won the first half 15-10, Kangyuan tried hard to counterattack in the second half, and once led 25-21 in the last ten minutes. Afterwards, the two sides fought even more fiercely, and the scores rose and fell, leveling each other many times. In the last minute, Shizhong narrowly won Kangyuan 30-28. The results of each game are as follows:</p>

<p>[Report from our Correspondent] Since Chen Shulin became the principal of Xiangjiang Middle School in Kowloon, he has worked hard to manage the school, employing experts to serve as teachers, and implementing educational policies during this extraordinary period. He pays special attention to physical education and plans to implement military-style training and forced exercise. In the past month, he has specially ordered a large number of sports equipment from a famous fitness equipment company in Hong Kong, and is building an outdoor fitness equipment field to meet the current needs. Construction started yesterday. When fully completed, the equipment will include: A.

<h3>South China Seeks Members, Awards Flags Last Night</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying and others participate</p>
<p>The South China Athletic Association held its second membership solicitation flag-awarding departure meeting at 7:30 last night at the Confucian Hall on Caroline Hill. Hundreds of people, including Xu Shiying, Zhou Wenzhi, lawyer Luo Xie Dong, Du Yuesheng, Mo Qing, Huo Bao Cai, and Mrs. Chen Fengwei, attended. Lawyer Luo chaired the meeting. At the time, after performing the rituals, the chairman announced the reasons, briefly stating that tonight is the South China Athletic Association's membership solicitation flag-awarding departure meeting. Everyone, as the name implies, should know the reason for tonight's meeting. The South China Association is organized by a majority of members, so it holds a membership solicitation every year. The strength and work of the Association each year depend on the results of the solicitation. The strength of the Association depends on the number of members, and the progress of the work depends on the amount of funds received. Membership solicitation has a great relationship with the Association, so the ceremony of awarding the flag at the beginning of the solicitation departure expresses the grand occasion of the departure and also wishes each team a good start. Tonight, we are very honored and excited that Mr. Xu Shiying is here to award the flags. It can be predicted that the results of this solicitation will exceed previous ones. At present, the country is in a difficult time, and many domestic sports organizations have been sacrificed. The Association is fortunate to be able to promote sports overseas, and the mission it shoulders should be even greater than before. The chairman hopes that the comrades of each team will work harder on this solicitation so as to achieve unprecedented results, so that the Association can carry out considerable development. This is the chairman's earnest hope. After the speech, Xu Shiyang awarded the flags. Dozens of teams, including the Zhou Zhizhi team, accepted the flags. Xu Shiying and the chairman of the association, Zhou Wenzhi, gave words of encouragement. Finally, there was a wonderful recreational program to help celebrate, and the meeting adjourned at 10 PM.</p>

<h3>Let's Also Talk About Children's Sports (4)</h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>It is certainly harmful to a child's health to eat without restriction, but it is even more harmful to eat in moderation without regard to whether the food is clean or filthy, fresh or stale, to eat indiscriminately without choice. Unlimited eating only damages the digestive organs, while filthy and rotten food can bring lethal microorganisms into the stomach, sending you home in a few days or even hours. We can see children everywhere who, after handling dirty things, with their hands covered in dust, use those hands, the headquarters of microorganisms, to put food in their mouths, even eating rotten food without aversion. Parents often do not know how to guide them, watching helplessly as they eat this great enemy of health.</p>
<p>The purpose of wearing clothes is to protect body temperature. The degree of clothing should be increased or decreased with the warmth or coldness of the climate, always being appropriate. Too little or too much clothing not only defeats the purpose of wearing clothes, but can also affect health. How do Chinese children dress? When it gets cold, they put on cotton-padded clothes and fur coats, making the children swollen, clumsy, and unable to move. When it gets hot, they wear thin shirts and trousers, even stripping naked, regardless of whether they can tolerate it. In one day, a child's clothing can go from winter to summer, from summer to winter. Such a sudden cold and sudden heat in clothing can cause adults to catch a cold, let alone children?</p>
<p>"Melancholy breeds disease" is an old saying that worry can affect health. Children are naturally optimistic and do not know what it means to be sad. This old saying does not seem to apply to children, but because the nerves that govern their muscles are not yet fully developed, their movements are often inaccurate. Because their brains have not yet matured, their actions and words are often wrong. Parents often hope their children will arrive too quickly. Therefore, when children have inaccurate movements and wrong words and deeds, they do not forgive them, scolding them lightly and beating them severely, even adding beatings after scolding. This makes children feel that there is no right place for them. Their repressed and unequal anger, which they dare not speak, accumulates in their chests and cannot be vented. This invisible stimulation in spirit is more harmful to the body than any kind of tangible, unhappy environment. Coupled with children's weak constitution, how can they withstand such ruthless treatment?</p>
<p>All of this may be enough to extinguish children's active nature, making them dull and wooden, figures who can only be passive and cannot be active. Or it may not give children timely and appropriate exercise, making them all angels of iron, shouldering the heavy task of national rejuvenation. Or it may be enough to affect children's health, making their exercise work do more with less, unable to achieve quick and effective results. If we do not talk about children's sports, then so be it. If we want to discuss children's sports, I think we must first get rid of all of these things, then research a suitable method to implement according to the needs. Otherwise, it is not a truly fundamental solution. (The End)</p>

<h3>From Primitive Swindling to the Final Stage</h3>
<p>— Prism</p>
<p>The method is ancient. The alchemy swindle. In the city, there's a scam where one-dollar bills are turned into two. Some swindlers are Westerners, so like alchemy, whether it originated from one dollar or two remains to be investigated. If there's an interest in investigating, it's easier to start now, but it seems only a thousand years later will such investigation have value. Now, we can only feel that this isn't even a rare form of swindling. What makes it rare is the deceived. How could they believe in such a primitive scam? Isn't that too foolish? However, while we seem confident in not falling into the same trap, we have no guarantee of not falling into a similar one. The circle of knowledge indeed varies in size, but at the edge of the circle, the chance of stepping into foolishness is equal.</p>
<p>To argue a bit, we don't believe one bill can turn into two. Rather, we should look at our foolishness. Business behavior, in fact, is based on the principle of turning one bill into two. In business, seeking both principal and profit is a perfectly legitimate desire. If we read the essays of great economists on savings, we'll see them say that prize savings are unfavorable. Depositing two thousand yuan for fifteen years still only yields two thousand yuan. But with fixed savings, fifteen years could yield eight thousand yuan. That is, three times the principal and profit in fifteen years, or once every five years. The interest rate is a perfectly normal one cent and two li per month. This is naturally not a swindle, but economics. Yet this is all advertising. Those who are swayed by this advertising to save are not seen as good at managing money, but merely as low-ability individuals incapable of managing money. We know there's something called a trust business, right? This name clearly tells us that those with low knowledge trust the superior insights of others.</p>
<p>Superior insights naturally exceed our circle of knowledge, but let's foolishly ask within our circle: Why would the trustee give the depositor principal and profit? Here, if we want to glimpse the profoundness of superior insights, we might as well marvel at the cleverness of a magic trick. Five years, to a businessman, is truly a long time. If principal and profit came only once every five years, a businessman would starve. One return in two or three years is considered perfectly normal. One year is just average. When things go smoothly, half a year, three months, ten days, five days aren't rare. Even the hope of gaining principal and profit in one day can be excluded from dreams. Only realizing it instantly is considered fantasy, right? But the distance between an instant and a day is much smaller than the distance between a day and five years. Here, should I believe that one yuan can turn into principal and profit in a day? Don't believe it? Leaving aside speculation, every small exchange shop buys in one hao and can turn it into ten cents. If someone exchanges hao for cents every six minutes, then after an hour, their original ten hao becomes ten cents and one hao. This isn't an illusion at all, but rather a business that carries a strong hint of illusion. However, tricks that have already been exposed can be ignored, while those not yet exposed, under the protection of superior insights, are hard to believe even if set up.</p>
<p>We generally all know about the issuance of pre-sale coupons, right? If you have fifty thousand yuan worth of goods, and you can sell ten thousand yuan worth of coupons, then use that money to buy more goods, the fifty thousand yuan clearly becomes a hundred thousand yuan. If you could sell a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand yuan worth of coupons, then turning fifty thousand yuan into three times that amount is possible. Selling this many coupons naturally doesn't seem like a fact. However, many methods result in the same outcome. Why bother with retail sales using coupons when you can exchange the whole batch for one certificate? For example, mortgaging to a bank. Bankers naturally say verbally that they are unwilling to do such improper transactions, but in reality, they may consider it a good business. Lenders worry about losing money, but even if they lose money, they must first repay the loan before closing the door. The loss is the boss's problem. Borrowers hope to make money. Making money repays the principal and still leaves profit in their pockets. In fact, during business operations, making or losing money is indiscernible. So in times without special changes, goods always accumulate more and more until they become complete waste, and only then comes the final reckoning. At that time, silver coins have already become the most worthless among the waste.</p>
<p>Here, the foolishness of the above statement should be pointed out. Saying that there's a way to turn fifty thousand yuan into a hundred thousand yuan by including money obtained from others on the boss's account is something that should belong to others. Coupons can be used to temporarily occupy the funds, taking advantage of the fact that many people don't come to redeem them. And borrowing money is clearly incurring debt, which cannot be included in one's assets. Correct! But theoretically, debts must be repaid, while in fact, debts grow larger and larger, which is a measure of business development. Turning it around is equivalent to not having to repay A, as it is offset with goods, which share the same final fate as money. Looking at commerce as a whole, it can be said that it is purely this way. If looked at individually, there are also many cases of paying off debts, losing all capital, and thus going bankrupt. The reason, of course, is that expenses exceed income. And the total amount of these expenses is definitely no less than one or two times the amount of capital. If we don't want to defend the necessity of capitalism's wastefulness, then the tactic of turning one into two is still successful. It just doesn't dissipate as quickly.</p>
<p>This basic, clever trick of commerce has been consistently applied to finance in fascist countries. This is something that they themselves know is not applicable, because in finance, spending routinely exceeds use. In terms of business nature, it's bound to lead to bankruptcy. But other than this, there's no way out, so they can't worry about it anymore. This further proves the law that fascism is the final stage of capitalism.</p>
<h3>Fortuitous Peace</h3>
<p>— Chen Ren</p>
<p>To wager decades of hard-earned energy in a desperate gamble for luck is undoubtedly a suicidal policy. Confronted with strength, failing to resist valiantly and merely seeking temporary peace is tantamount to sitting and awaiting death.</p>
<p>Luck and complacency are both unacceptable. Yet the world is full of people seeking luck, and the sole hope of the lucky rests upon the complacent.</p>
<p>However, the world is even more full of elements greedy for complacency, and the sole hope of the complacent turns out to be peace.</p>
<p>The foundation of peace is not built upon complacency. All who cherish peace should seek survival in struggle and strike the lucky with a painful blow at every opportunity. To seek compromise through concession, to seek complacency through compromise, and to seek peace through complacency is simply courting self-destruction.</p>
<p>The lucky have opened their bloody mouths, visibly devouring Guangzhou, Hainan Island, and Southern China, piece by piece. Yet the complacent still dream of peace. But where is peace? The answer is a flurry of bombs, the sound of artillery fire, and the blood and flesh of tens of millions of innocent people flying everywhere.</p>
<p>When peace is hopeless and the psychology of the complacent loses its basis, the hopes of the lucky inevitably fall through. Only when the final desperate gamble is cast can the dawn of true peace re-emerge in the world. Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Chen Yinque</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>Mr. Chen was the least Westernized and least pretentious professor among the faculty, completely embodying the demeanor of a scholar. Whether going to or from class, or going out, he never carried a leather briefcase, but rather a large book bag made of coarse cloth. The wrapping cloth came in several colors: red, purple, and yellow. Depending on the subject being taught that day, the color of the cloth wrapping his books would be different. However, he was one of the most internationally renowned scholars. He could freely use English and French. He had lived in Germany for years, and his German was also excellent. He had also studied Buddhism in India, and could read and speak Sanskrit. At Tsinghua University, he was not only a history professor, but also a mentor for Buddhist studies, teaching Sanskrit. His breadth of knowledge was evident.</p>
<p>Among the professors in Tsinghua's Faculty of Arts, Mr. Wen Yiduo was the best at making connections between research topics. But Mr. Chen was the most difficult to connect with, which shows the rigor of his scholarship. Mr. Chen could recite ancient texts from memory. He specialized in the history of the Sui, Tang, and Northern and Southern Dynasties, especially the Tang Dynasty. He could even recite the Old and New Tang Books with his eyes closed. Japanese sinologists admired and respected Mr. Chen, regarding him as an authority on the history of the Sui, Tang, and Northern and Southern Dynasties, which shows his great reputation. Mr. Feng Youlan, who rose to fame both domestically and internationally for his History of Chinese Philosophy, was also Mr. Chen's student. Therefore, one could always see Mr. Feng bowing respectfully to his teacher. In the review report that Mr. Chen wrote for Mr. Feng's History of Chinese Philosophy, Mr. Chen had this self-deprecating remark: "Yinque's studies in his life have been neither ancient nor modern, his thoughts confined to the eras of Xianfeng and Tongzhi, and his arguments resembling those between Xiangxiang and Nanpi..." In fact, it was entirely a humble statement. His research scope was not "neither modern nor ancient," but rather both modern and ancient, with broad thoughts and far-reaching insights.</p>
<p>He was the only famous historian in contemporary China. He also had unique views on historical research: He advocated that "historians all believe that historical theories are irrelevant to historical research and even harmful. However, the authors of historical theories, intentionally or unintentionally, imprint the author and the background of their era when they express their views, which is no different from today's newspaper editorials and commentaries. If used universally, they will all help to examine history." As for the evaluation of the authenticity of ancient Chinese works, he advocated: "With today's textual research in China, it is enough to distinguish the authenticity of ancient books. However, authenticity is merely a relative issue, and the most important thing is to be able to determine the era and author of false materials and utilize them. False materials can sometimes be as valuable as true materials. If one directly recognizes them as the genuine products of the era and author they rely on, it is unacceptable. But if one can find out the era and author of the forgery to explain the thoughts of this era and author, it will become a true material." Due to Mr. Chen's insightful views, the object and scope of materials for the study of Chinese history have become increasingly broad. Therefore, even in his class on the history of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, he not only studied the contemporary politics, economy, and cultural system, etc. from a macro perspective, but also researched that Li Bai was a foreigner, Liu Chong was a Persian, and even the origins of solitary graves, the eastward transmission of Turkish bath methods to the Tang Dynasty, and the construction of imperial palaces after An Lushan and Shi Siming's rebellions, etc., all of which were the objects of his careful research. I remember that in Tsinghua, in Mr. Chen's class, he always talked about the poets Du Fu and Bai Juyi's Changhenge, Qi Xing, Nineteen Ancient Poems, etc., all of which had new inventions that were convincing.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a good habit he learned from the West, but he was never a second late for class, no matter the time. Among the common diseases of professors who are unpunctual, he was an oddity. All year round, he always wore "splendid" clothes and "splendid" shoes. In winter, he wore two fur robes, but the robe surface was coarse cloth, completely the true colors of a Chinese scholar.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Chen's father died for the country in the ancient city, Mr. Chen went south in a roundabout way, writing the Port defense system, and the sorrow of his family and country weighed on his heart. How could a sickly body bear it? It seems that Mr. Chen will soon be heading abroad again. I would like to wish him good health here.</p>

<h3>Sheep and Wolf</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zhang</p>
<p>If Czechoslovakia can be compared to the last docile sheep in Europe, then Germany is the mad wolf, and England and France are the shepherds. Standing in the position of shepherds, England and France wanted to scare away this wild beast with whips before June. Later, seeing that the wolf was perhaps really hungry, they thought that if they didn't give it something to eat, it might cause even greater chaos. They sacrificed the Sudetenland, thinking it wouldn't come again. From then on, they thought they could be smug when seeing this beast and come to a "appeasement" "agreement" with it in Europe, thinking that the world could be at peace. But they didn't expect that six months later, the wolf would gradually grow stronger and its appetite would increase. The shepherds were then frightened into silence.</p>
<p>How regrettable and hateful this is!</p>
<p>The lovable sheep were sacrificed tragically. On the one hand, we regret their painful encounter, but on the other hand, we hate their own weakness. We deeply hate the wolf's ferocity and England and France's indulgence.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia itself was not without the ability to resist. Although it was a weak and oppressed country, it had a foundation of heavy industry, substantial military equipment, and especially a population with a firm sense of patriotism. This failure was due to a group of confused governing leaders who didn't understand the principle of "too many cooks spoil the broth," couldn't think of a way for the sheep's strength to resist a mad wolf, and only kowtowed to the greedy, thinking that sacrificing a little was okay, so that they could gain the pity of the eater, leading to today's tragic situation. The authorities in Czechoslovakia, such as President Hacha, who only knew how to compromise and seek complete security, cannot shirk their responsibility.</p>
<h3>Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>When she was about to leave, she wanted to say a few words to him, but her throat was choked with a handkerchief, and she couldn't speak. So, she picked up a pencil from the table and wrote a few words on the white tablecloth:</p>
<p>"I want to say a few words. Please take the handkerchief away and let me take it myself, if you want."</p>
<p>"No!" After he said that, she wrote again:</p>
<p>"Please tell me, have we ever had any grievances between us?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Then why do you insist on taking me away?"</p>
<p>"For money, money!"</p>
<p>What she wanted to continue writing was:</p>
<p>"Ah, so you're a bandit!"</p>
<p>But he thought:</p>
<p>"Ah, so you're a hero of the greenwood!"</p>
<p>"Tell you, I'm a volunteer army soldier!"</p>
<p>The three words "volunteer army soldier" sounded familiar to her. Hadn't she heard many stories of the volunteer army? Hadn't their failures saddened her? Hadn't their victories brought her joy? Hadn't she placed her emotions in their experiences? Didn't she still remember? The photos of them that she kept, some wearing long robes, some wearing only shorts, some without "Wula" using women's red shirts to wrap their feet, these people pulling strings for their homeland were as poor as beggars. Hadn't she secretly donated money in school for them? Hadn't she tolerated her father's strict reprimands in order to save them from poverty?</p>
<p>"Communicating secretly with the volunteer army is a capital crime! Don't you know that?"</p>
<p>Yes, even if her father didn't tell him, he would know. Couldn't he see the young people who were often sentenced to death? Dying under the knife, dying in the ice caves of the Songhua River, dying in sacks (putting people in sacks, sewing up the opening, and having two or four people hold the corners of the sack and constantly throw it to the ground until death.) Dying in various newly invented cruel methods - death performances in the era of tyranny.</p>
<p>"If you don't listen to me again, I'll lock you at home to prevent you from causing trouble for me." (Twelve) After suffering bombing Hong Feng carves</p>
