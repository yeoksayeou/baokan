<h3 id="c1">英蘇軍事合作的重大 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>據今日本港士蔑西報所載羅馬可靠消息，「蘇聯曾向英方建議，如遇有戰爭時，英方得自由利用海參威及堪察加兩地」。至其合作的目的，據稱，則在共同對付日本：蘇聯以上列兩地供給英蘇使用的交換條件，却爲英國經由加拿大供給蘇聯軍火。若此則英國將以海參威爲根據地，並以堪察加爲加拿大空軍的根據地，英國已不獨在海洋上擁有星加坡軍港，足以抵抗日本海軍的侵犯，打擊日本在太平洋的力量，並且可以在日本海方面切斷日本陸軍的聯絡，並以空軍力量威脅日本三島。倘若這個合作果然實現，則好戰的日本軍閥不屈服於英美蘇，也必走上整個的破局。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義不但依靠日本海的安全進行其大陸的侵畧，卽其此後保障所侵略結果，更須依賴於這個路綫的聯絡。在「九一八事變」以前，日本全國幾乎完全忽略了日本沿海岸，卽所謂「裏日本」的經營。自明治維新以後數十年間經營的成績完全集中於太平洋的沿岸，卽所謂「表日本」，卽其鐵道也以縱貫的形式發展的，橫貫的鐵道非常之少。但自「九一八事變」後，日本侵畧者十二分感覺到要保障大陸的賍物，就須充分開擴日本三島與大陸的聯絡綫，並儘可能縮短這方面的聯絡綫及時間。於是採取三方面經營三管齊下的辦法：其一建築朝鮮北部的新港，淸津，雄基，及羅津；其二積極經營日本海西岸的各港口，如敦賀及舞鶴等處；其三加緊經營吉林及黑龍江兩省的鐵路網。其結果，日本內地與大陸的聯絡綫縮短了很多。比如從長春經由淸津而至敦賀，要比經由大連近至七百五十公里以上；由長春乘長圖綫經淸津到大阪，比經由大連貨運時間減少十七小時，客運時間更減少二十一小時。</p>
<p>朝鮮北部三港的建築，不但在經濟上奪去了海參威的運輸中心地位，並且具有極重要的政治及軍事意義在焉。日本軍隊雖說欲藉「現地主義」以期在大陸自給自足，但在最近的將來，這種希望依然是空的，因爲日軍的食品大部分還須由日本內地供給。「滿洲方面」的軍火製造還不能供給多少成分，充其量不過是基本原料，這些原料還須經過日本內地兵工廠的加工始成。在政治上，如果這條線的聯絡被切斷，則不但「滿洲」方面完全起了恐慌，卽朝鮮方面也都有發生大紊亂的可能。据美國外交政策協會的報告，去年潛入東北的第八路軍非常活躍，更是極大的威脅。</p>
<p>英國能着眼到日本這一個咽喉，實在非常聰明，倘能切實與美蘇合作，則制日本軍閥×××，是易如反掌的。英蘇的空軍再能發揮最大的威力，則日本三島馬上成了焦土。日本城市設備及家屋建築之易於燬滅，整個三島在短期間卽可成爲廢據，姑且不提，卽其工商業因爲資本主義發展的結果，集中於幾個大都市，如東京橫濱區，大阪神戶區，及九州北部，等。這一點是日本最脆弱的地方，日本的敵人能攻擊這個弱點，日本帝國的××是很容易到來的。日本也鑑於日本海聯絡綫被切斷時的危險性，所以軍部正計劃建築一條海底通路，以應萬一之需，但是海底交通路不是一年兩年可以完成的，日本的敵人若能乘其未完成的期間，給與一個大打擊，那末消滅一個世界侵略者，保衞遠東眞正和平，就可以容易達到目的。</p>
<h3 id="c2">戰時上海金融市塲 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 朱博泉</p>
<p>朱博泉先生在國內金融界之地位，想爲讀者所素諗，渠以業中人之眼光，觀察戰時上海金融市場之動態，自較一般人更爲深刻，詳盡尢在其次，故亟爲發表。希讀者注意。　編者</p>
<p>一　前言</p>
<p>上海爲我國通商巨埠，握全國金融樞紐。據各方統計，一九三七年六月底止上海之銀行。占全國銀行總數百分之三二以上，（分支行不計在內）其中四十一家會員銀行之實收資本，占全國銀行實收資本總額百分之四五，資產總額，占全國百分之四四。五，各種存欵，且占全國銀行存欵百分之七六左右，而中央銀行及其他非會員銀行，尙不在內。此外尙有外商銀行，錢莊，信託公司，銀公司，儲蓄會等金融組織，而外商銀行及錢莊在上海金融市塲中，尤有久遠之歷史，深厚之勢力，與商華銀行成鼎足之勢。</p>
<p>近數年來，滬市金融界，飽經憂患，故力圖改進，如一二八滬變之後，上海銀錢業先後有聯合準備會之組織，其後銀行業復成立票據交換所及票據承兌所，團結日堅，實力益充。一九三五年十一月改革幣制，集中全國經濟命脈之白銀，統一發行，金融基礎，更臻穩定。此種成就，在中日戰事發生之前，早已發揮其效能，而在戰事期中，尤可充分證明其價値。</p>
<p>二　開戰前後之金融市塲</p>
<p>一九三七年上半年國內一般經濟情形，均呈蓬勃氣象，自一九三五年幣制改革後，一般物價　開始上升，工商業受物價上漲刺激，莫不欣欣向榮，各市場交易頻繁，殆爲近　年來所罕見，一九三七年上半年上海銀行票據交換總額，較上年同時的增六分之一，金融狀况亦極安定。市場拆息，恒盤旋於一角左右。外匯市况，始終受政府銀行控制、穩定異常。公債行市，六月間高達八十九元以上。金錢業存放業務，亦一致遞增。不意蘆溝橋事件爆發，市場震撼，上海虹橋飛機場事件繼之以起，中日全面戰爭，於焉展開。</p>
<p>自蘆溝橋事件爆發後，首受影饗者，卽爲上海之金融界。公　市况，自七月七日以後，即急劇下降，交易所一日停拍數次，幾爲常事，迄至七月份交割時期，政府規定最低價以七十元爲限。始吿平靖。斯時一般懷疑法幣者，已紛紛提取存欵，購買外匯或轉存外商銀行，資金逃避，爲數甚鉅。八月初旬，滬局愈趨嚴重，提存之風，其勢益甚。迨八一三滬戰爆發，上海頓成戰區，人心恐慌，無法抑制。各交易所首先停市，銀錢業亦奉命於八月十三日起停業四天。財政部爲維持金融計，特公布安定金融辦法，限制提存，同時復由銀錢業擬訂補充辦法，就交換制度，加以利用，釐定票據匯劃方法，金融恐慌，始得减免。八月十七日起，銀錢業一律復業，一時要求提取存欵者，雖仍紛至來，但以定有限度，旦因中中交農四行貼放會及銀行業聯合準備會已有調劑同業辦法，故能應付裕如，人心亦趨安定，至年終各行莊之存戶，頗有將以前提出之欵重行存入者，藍依財政部安定金融辦法，凡於戰後以法幣交付銀行錢莊續存或開立新戶者，得隨時照數支取法幣，不加限制。同時復因戰前活期存欵，在提存限額之外，儘得以同業匯劃票流通，因此各行存欵數額，不致大量滅少。至當時市塲情形，一般均呈通貨緊縮之像，信用停滯，加以交通阻梗，各　與上海之商業往來瀕於斷絕，工商各業，幾均陷於停頓狀態。且因貨物來源阻塞，物價飛漲，尤以燃料糧食等必需品爲最甚。惟當時政府對於外匯價格，始終維持，所以鞏固法幣信用者，實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>三　戰時金融市場之演變</p>
<p>戰事發生以來，上海之各種金融狀態，大率隨環境而變遷，且彼此均有連帶關係，或互爲因果，如欲加以分析，實非易事。爲便於叙述起見，試就年餘來金融市塲之重要演變，分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）同業匯劃與貼水掉現戰前上海銀錢業之支付工具，除法幣現鈔外，計有兩種票據，一爲劃頭票據，當日可以取現，與現鈔無異，一爲匯劃票據，隔日方能取現。安定金融辦法，規定凡戰前所存三百元以上之活期存疑，每星期提欵，以存欵餘額百份之五爲限，至多不得超過一百五十云，同時復由上海銀錢業呈准財政部規定：「各行莊活期存欵除遵照部定辦法支付法幣外，其在商業部往來，因商業上之需要，得於部定限止外，以同業匯劃票據付給之。」此種同業匯劃票據，　准在上海同業之間劃帳，不付法幣，並不得轉購外匯，與戰前隔日取現之匯割票據，完全不同，其目的在便利工商資金之　通，而同時避免資金之逃避。一二八滬戰時，上海錢莊所出本票，亦曾一度停止隔日取現，祇准同業匯劃，蓋與此次情形，大同小異，按上海工商交易，在平時皆係轉帳　付，以法幣支付者，本屬少數，戰後匯劃票據祗准同業轉帳，不得付現，對於商業上之需要，本無若何影響。惟上海一部份外商銀行，因與華商銀錢業素無往來，間有不願收受此種票據者；而一般進口洋商，因其不能轉購外匯，漸存歧視，更有缺少法幣頭寸之家。爲便於使用起見，往往願以匯劃票據百元作現款九十八九元掉換現鈔，遂開匯劃掉現貼水之端。一般投機商人見有利可圖，爭以掉現爲業；於是匯劃票據，遂成買賣對象。其初每千元貼水，約在四五元至一二十元上下，其後市面之匯劃票據流通日多，而貼水掉現者亦愈眾：加以租界人口驟增，生活所需均須法幣現鈔，又因外匯統制後，黑市場交易活躍，影響所及，貼水率繼長增高，至上年六月份，每千元貼水一度曾高達七十餘一元。嗣經銀行業聯合準備會出而維持，大量調劑，始將貼水穩定於五十元左右。上年十一月閒，廣州武漢相繼失守，人心不安，又多以匯劃票據掉換現鈔，轉購外匯或現金者，貼水率復曾高漲至六十元以上。不久戰局穩定，亦即囘至四十五元左右。本年一月閒，經銀行業聯合凖備會每日公布買進及賣出行市，正式加以管理後，貼水率已穩定每千元三十五元左右，每日僅有數角之上落。本年三月初，因受外匯及現金市况之影響，同時華北復有擾亂幣制之說，凖備會公布之貼現率，提　至每千元四十元，不久又升至五十元，目下市面貼現率仍在四十八元左右。</p>
<p>二，同業貼放與利率一九三五年幣制改革之後，政府原有將中央銀行改組爲中央準備銀行之計劃，籌備未成熟而滬戰已起，財政部除限制提存外，故復令中央中國交通中國農民等四家政府銀行，就各重要都市組織聯合辦事處及聯合貼放會，以便統一事權，共負調劑金融之職責。上海四行貼放會專辦同業抵押放欵及商業票據之貼現，以貼放劃頭欵項爲主。至同業匯劃欵項之貼放，則由四行貼放會委託銀行業聯合準備會與該會原有各項拆放合併辦理。前年九月底止，貼放會之放欵，共約一千八百餘萬元，銀行業聯台準備會所放同業匯劃欵項亦達一千萬元左右。戰後銀錢業爲準備提存，需欵甚殷。得斯接濟，乃能應付裕如。據上年六月底之統計，四行貼放會各地貼放數額，總計五千餘萬元。至上年年底爲止，四行貼放在外之欵，據財部發言人談，總計已達八千九百萬元，其中在上海貼放者，約一千六百餘萬元，占總數白分之二十左右，較前年九月間已減少二百萬元。上海銀行業聯合凖備會同業匯劃拆放數額，至上年底爲止，計五百餘萬元，較前年九月問减少五百萬元左右。</p>
<p>上海金融市場之拆息，向有二種，一爲錢業公會之拆息，係錢莊同業間拆欵之利率。一係銀行業聯台準備會之拆息及貼現率，係銀行同業間拆欵貼現之利率，自四行貼放會成立後，每日亦公布拆息及貼現牟，上海金融市場，乃有三種不同之利率。</p>
<p>錢業公會之拆息，在前年六七兩月，均爲每千元日息一角一分，八月初旬，因滬局形勢轉緊，每日遞升，至十三日高達一角九分，十七日銀錢業開市後，遂站定二角，十一月與十二月降爲一角五分，上年一月復降至一角，以後無大上落。十月一度升至一角四分，旋卽回平，自下盤旋於一角二分左右。</p>
<p>銀行業聯合準備會之拆息與貼現率，分匯劃，國幣二種。前年七月份匯劃及國幣拆息，均爲每千元日息一角一分，貼現率為一角二分。八月十三日滬戰發生後，國幣拆息及貼現率高至三角，匯劃亦達二角，十月十一月匯劃拆息及貼現率降爲一角八分，十二月復升至二角，上年八月初，國幣之拆息與貼現率，更降至二角五分，迄今並無變動。</p>
<p>貼放會前年八月份所開貼現率爲週息八厘，放款息爲每千元日息三角，上年八月起，貼現率改爲週息七厘半，放欵息改爲每千元每日二角半，與銀行業聯合準備會所開利率相等。</p>
<p>觀銀錢業拆息之變動，可知滬市金融情勢，已由緊張而漸趨寬弛。惟上述錢業拆息，戰後似較銀行拆息爲抵，相差幾達一半，推原其政，實因匯劃本爲錢業之記賬本位，各銀行所有之劃頭寸，向來集中於錢業，而錢業對於同業存息，係照拆息計算，若拆息增高，則錢莊對於同業存放之匯劃存息，自須隨之增高。無異增加錢莊之負擔，且戰後匯劃票據，不得付現，錢莊之匯劃頭寸，較前寬裕，更不願抬高拆息，自加負祖，實則錢莊對外放款，照坐盤加每月平均拆息，其利率亦須月息八厘左右，（如今年二月份錢業折息月差三元加坐盤四元半爲七元半即月息七厘半）與銀行放欵利率，不相上下也。</p>
<p>（三）法幣之發行額自幣制改革後，全國通貨之發行權，專屬于中中交農四行，各行之發行準備，亦集中于統一管理之下。經此空前改革，、金融基礎，益臻健全，故前年戰事爆發後，人心雖極度恐慌，而貨幣方面，得以毫無問題。</p>
<p>當戰事發生之初，一般人士鑒於歐戰之往事，頗有以通貨膨脹爲慮者，然就戰後發行準備管理委員會歷次檢査報吿之數字加以觀察，發行總額，雖有遞增然與戰事前後比較，似尙無通貨膨脹之現象。據該會之檢査報告，一九三七年終發行總額爲一，六三九，〇九八，〇〇〇元，一九三八年六月底增至一，七二六，九九八，〇〇〇元，其增加率，實不及改革初期之速。蓋自一九三五年十二月至一九三六年十二月，法幣發行額共增五萬六千八百萬元，自一九三六年十二月至一九三七年十二月，共增三萬七千九百萬元，而一九三八年上半年則僅增加八千七百餘萬元。一九三八年六月以後之發行數字，該會未有正式公布，目前無從統計。</p>
<p>至於滬市法幣流通數量與其流通之速度，一般觀察，更無顯著增加。反限制提存後，一部份通貸，變爲封鎖賬目，加以工商停滯，通貨之流通速度且在大减。</p>
<p>（四）外匯統制與外匯暗市我國對外匯價，在幣制改革前，向任其自然上落，幣　改革後。外匯賈賣由國家銀行集中管理，對外匯價，始臻穩定。戰事爆發之初，國內資金，曾一度發生逃避，當時論者。僉以統制外匯爲戰時必要之措置；惟政府當局、以我國　境特殊。尙不　貿然處　。至上年三月初，華北設立所謂「聯合凖備銀行」發行不兌現紙幣，圖掉換法幣，套取外匯：政府爲防範計，乃不得不於上年三月十四日，公布外匯請核規則，規定各銀行因正當用途，於收付相抵後，需用外匯時，得向中央銀行申請購買，經中央銀行核准後，按照法定匯價售與外匯，其無正當用途或不必要之貨物進口，則不得申請購買，上年六月間　絡續規定限制進口貨物之種類，並規定各銀行在申請外匯時，應提供同額法幣現軟，以防故意逾額申請之弊。同時爲增加外匯基金起見，對於出口貿易之外匯，亦由國家銀行集中管理。凡商人運貨出口所得外匯貨價，亦應售與國家銀行。上年八月八起日，又規定凡上年一月一日以後　運入口之進口貨申請外匯，中央銀行不再接受，但對於必需品之進口，仍酌量予以供給，至是外匯統制益臻嚴密。</p>
<p>在外匯統制以前，上海外匯行市，槪照中央銀行公布之匯價爲標準，各洋商銀行亦均遵守紳士協定，照中央銀行掛牌，自實行統制後，此項紳士協定，無形取消，同時一般進口商人因不能向中央銀行如數購到外匯，不得不在中央銀行以外以高價收買，以應其需要，復以租界人士之善於杞憂者，爲個人財產之一種保險計，紛紛購買外匯，故中央銀行對於核准之外匯，雖仍照原定匯價供給，而上海市上之外匯暗市，已遠　法定匯率爲昂。</p>
<p>外匯暗市之存在，於滬市貿易金融均有不良之影響，補救辦法，實有賴於外商銀行及各友那之合作，最近中英一千萬鎊新借欵成立，並指定充平衡法幣外匯之用。是以穩定我國外匯之國際條件，業已確保，今後惟盼國人厲行節約，少購舶來品，勿圖私利，勿作投機，使外匯去路不致增加，則暗市不特　日漸穩定，且不難達根本消滅之目的。</p>
<p>（五）公債之暗盤交易公債市塲，在上海金融機構中，亦占重要地位，銀錢業對於公債買賣，不但視爲可靠之投資，同時亦可用爲調節資金之方法，游資多時，購儲公債，缺時卽售之市場，具有第二重營業準備之性質，國內公債，過去有三十餘種之多，經一九三六年之整理，已歸併爲一種年息六厘之統一公債，分甲乙丙丁戊五種發行，又爲平衡國庫收支，復興經濟起見，發行復興公債一種，此項公債，在市場並無交易。經此整理後，財政基礎，益臻健全，債信轉形穩固，價格日漸提高，一九三七年六月，各債行市，最高曾達八十九元左右，自戰事爆發後，形勢乃突變。</p>
<p>在前年七月初旬蘆變爆發以後，滬上公債市况，卽呈急劇下降之勢，交易所一日停拍數次，幾爲常事，卒由財政部限制統一公債最低價爲七十元，始吿平靖。滬戰爆發，上海華商證券交易所暫停營業，惟場外交易，依然活動，每日成交數目一二十萬元，增至六七十萬，其後，逐漸成爲半公開之市場。最初晤盤市價，在四十元左右，上年一月底，政府爲免除資金逃避起見，對於統一公債之還本付息，改付同業匯劃款項，暗盤行市。跌進四十元以內，二月份最低價曾達三十七元之新紀錄。自三月至六月，最低價爲四十元，最高爲六十元。迨七月底到期公債本息，仍由政府照付法幣，暗盤行市，始穩　於五十四五元左右。九月底歐局緊張，全世界證券跌價，上海亦未能免此，各債每日有數角上落，和平消息傳出後，始復舊觀，嗣後因外匯行市穩定，套買外匯無利可圖，一部份游資遂趨赴公債市場，各債市價，一致上升，至今年一月間，統甲公債，創見六十三元之高價。惟本年初，財部以我國自失大宗關稅，以關稅擔保之債務，由政府墊付之欵，　累積至一萬七千五百萬元之鉅，故特宣佈對於戰前各長期債務，今後不再墊付，消息傳來，公債市場，乃引起軒然大波，一日間多者跌至六元有餘。後政府公佈對於一月底到期內債本息仍舊償付法幣，惟改在重慶付款，上海方面，可向中中交三行分六期領取，於六個月內付淸，於是人心稍定，債市回堅，最近中英新借欵成立，市况更趨積極，目下各債行市，最高在五十六元左右，最低在四十八元左右，若與戰前市價比較則已跌落三十元左右。戰後發行之救國公債，市價恒在三十六元左右。迄無變動。</p>
<p>（六）現金市場之復活上海標金市場，本爲投機者活動之所。以前每月成交數，常達三四百萬條，幣制改革後，即吿冷落。每月成交數不過四五千條，滬戰發生後，卽完全停止。我國幣制，原以白銀爲本位，自法幣政策實行，已成爲管理通貨。對外匯價，與世界金銀價格之變遷，早已失其聯繫。乃自上年三月政府實施外匯統制後，投機者又復利用世界金銀比價之變動，從中操縱：於是上海非公開市場之現金交易，頓形活躍。上年五月後上海現金價，受倫敦市場之影響，卽起漲風，六月中漲至二千元，（十兩標準金價）一度回軟，旋又重漲，十一月間曾達二千零六十八元。本年三月初，因現金籌碼缺乏，加以華北方面之收買，一度　創一千二百元之高價，目下仍　旋於二千一百元左右。現金市塲雖可影響一部份資金之移動，然因我國外匯基礎，已　穩定，中美白銀協定上年亦已展期，於整個金融，似無若何影響。</p>
<p>（七）票據交換之變動　上海之票據交換，分為華商　行錢莊及外商銀行等三組。華商銀行之票據交換所，成立於一九三三年一月，由銀行業聯合凖備會主辦，其交換手續，與歐美各國相仿，錢莊亦有匯劃，總會之組織，惟其交換方法甚爲陳舊，至外灘銀行（包括外商銀行及中中交三行在內）間之票據收解，則僅有軋賬方法，並無交換所之組織與制度。</p>
<p>銀行票據交換所，戰前每日於下平一時及三時三十分舉行交換二次，戰後因票據減少，改爲每日下午三時一次·一九三七年一月至七月，該所每日平均交　數，計二千九百餘萬元，八月至十二月每日平均僅七百萬元，約爲四與一之比。一九三八年一月至七月每日平均數僅六百餘萬元，八月至十二月稍有起色，每日平均約九百萬元。戰後各月交換數額，以一九三七年十二月份及一九三八年十二月份為　低，每日平均僅得三百六十萬元。惟近來交換數額，已逐漸　增，今年一月份，每日平均交換數已達二千四百餘萬元，機與戰前每日平均數不相上下，足見在特殊環境下上海之商業交易，已漸有活潑之趨勢。</p>
<p>錢莊之票據交換，向稱軋公單，其每日之公單物解數，係包括同業拆欵轉帳之數在內，與銀行之票據交換數字，性質不同，頗難比較，惟一般觀察，戰後錢莊之公單收解數，與銀行票據交換數之上落，其趨勢亦正相同。至錢業之票據收解方法，戰後已略有改進，向來由各莊派老司務分頭收票者，現已改由各莊派交換員二人於每日下午一時至二時全履劃總會集中辦理。又錢莊同業軋帳之公單，向來規定滿五百元者打大公單，不滿五百元及零數打小公單，每日向錢業準備庫軋淸，上年十一月間經錢業公會决議，將大小名稱取消、不論數目多寡，均打一紙公單，每日軋淸，手續已簡便。</p>
<p>至於外攤銀行之票據收解手續，向來於彼此送驗票據以後，均用大劃條由中國銀行爲總匯劃，每日互相結出差額後，用寄庫或解現方法了結，初無交換所之組織。自戰事發生後，已放棄其向所採用之大劃條辦法，改由各行每日派員於上午十一時半在匯豐銀行集中核對。又洋商銀行對於華商銀行向無存欠往來，戰後爲收解便利起見，洋商銀行旣破例向我中央銀行開立往來戶，中央銀行亦向洋商銀行開戶往來，由此華洋銀行間每日應收　解票據，互相委託代收，在往來戶內轉帳，較前便利不少。</p>
<p>（八）金融業之狀况戰事發生以來，上海金融業所處環境，逈異尋常。除外商銀行暫置不論外、就華商銀錢業言：自前年七月蘆溝橋變起，卽有提存風潮，在滬戰爆發之前一個月中，各行莊存欵，顯見减退。滬戰旣起，銀錢業停業四大，政府頒布安定金融辦法後，人心始稍安定，存欵遂無大量之减退。迨後戰區擴大，各地富有者紛紛携資來滬避難，於是各行莊存欵，漸有增加趨勢，惟此種增加之存欵，當以活期存款居多，在銀錢業方面，自不能不厚集準備以資應付。</p>
<p>戰後各行莊營業方針，力求穩健，對於各種放欵，頗爲謹愼，大都縮小營業範圍，祇收不放。幸而銀錢業之一部份押戶，在戰事中遭受損失者，最近因受上海物價高漲之利益，在彌補戰事損失外，尙有盈餘，故銀錢業戰前放欵，除在戰期中停止營業之客戶外，往往可以如期收囘。又各銀行業務，除一部份放款外匯等業務，戰後雖不免陷於停頓，而其他如保管倉庫房地產信託等業務，較之戰前反有增加之勢者，此種畸形發展，爲目下上　特殊環境下僅有之現象，其不能持久，自不待言。</p>
<p>在戰期中銀錢業資產上之損失，自屬難免，幸各行莊，平時大都營業穩健，準備充實，以前盈餘，抵補目下之損失，綽乎有餘。祗有極少數範圍較小之銀行，受戰事之打擊，聞有周轉不靈之苦。至於因此而倒閉者，則僅有一家銀行，同時在戰事發生前一月停業之四家銀行中。已有二家在上年先後復業。</p>
<p>中中交農四行，爲國內最大之政府銀行，在金融界有卓越之勢力，其總行原設在上海，滬戰發生後，此四家政府銀行，已將其總行移入內地，並在西南各省及香港等處分設機關，上海之金融勢力，已趨分散。目下上海各銀行，其平時運用資金之途徑　對象，在戰後均有壅塞減少之感，又因政府對于內地農鑛工商事業之開發，積極提倡，獎勵投資，因此滬市一般商業銀行，已有改向內地發展之趨勢，近來各銀行在川滇黔桂諸省設立分支行者，已有不少，金融重心，已有轉移之傾向，前途發展殊堪注意。</p>

<p>【重慶通訊】自抗戰爆發以來，我們所失去的都是工廠林立的都市，這些都市中的工人和工廠中的機器，並沒落在×人的手裏，工人們寧願分散四方，把他們最後的一點力量，把他們僅有的一個鐵釘，都給他們敬愛的祖國買献出來，以期取得最後的勝利。這就是中國工業合作協會產生的由來，也就是它的工作的中心。</p>
<p>爲使大家明瞭它工作的發展起見，中國工業合作協會，招待渝市中外記者，共到四十餘人，由劉廣沛先生致開會辭，說明此次招待之意義後。卽請該會最初之發起人愛利先生報吿他赴西北視察各工業合作社之情形。</p>
<p>愛利但先生美國人，地帶着蘇聯人民的那種質樸，站立起來，很誠懇地說：</p>
<p>「我以前决想不到我們能有什麽成功，但從我在西北各地視察歸來，中國工業合作社能有這麽迅速的發展，實在是出我意料之外的。中國的工人合作性非常强，同時他們雖受的敎育很少，可是只要經過一個短期間的訓練，便能做出各種物品，供給前方及後方的需要。這種合作社因爲規模很小，工人與社的關係就很密切，工人對于合作社就視同自己的家，所以對于社的開支總是力求節省。原價値一千六百元的機噐，工人能多方設法以半數的價去買到手。</p>
<p>「去年漢口工人疏散的時候，蔣夫人就送了一批女工到西北××去。這些女工便在山澗中或土審中工作起來。環境上顯然是比從前苦多了，可是若果有人去問她們願不願意回到原處去，她們一定囘答你是不願意，因爲她們現在在組織上有各人的團體，有各人的主席。在工作上，她們又能爲着自己的和整個民族的利益工作，嬰兒帶在身邊，父母丈夫也在身邊。這些丈夫從前是整日在茶館談天，不作一事，專　妻子過活的，可是現在也有工作的　趣了。』</p>
<p>大家聽見這個消息，都興奮了起來。</p>
<p>『合作社工人的組織能力非常强』。愛利先生接說；在西北已有聯合合作社的組織，還有合作招待所，這是替代工人解决生活及旅行購物時的困難而設的，這種招待所旣便宜又淸潔，其他各地皆可彷效。</p>
<p>『合作社的產品多是利用廢物和當地的土產來作原料，如乾電池多是收用了廢電池來加以改造。如軍服，軍氈則是利用西北特有的出產，以前這些牟毛，多是給　車一輛一輛送到日本去，而從那裏換了一輛一輛的日貨回來，現在則由羊毛合作社製作用品，供給前方。』</p>
<p>『西北有的是原料！』他慨嘆說；「遍處都是蘇打，結晶鹽，甘蔗……這些原料若加以製造，便成爲中國前後方所不可或缺的物品了。</p>
<p>『現在中國熱血的靑年多一半都上前綫，顧其實，後方的經濟戰爭與前方的槍砲戰爭是一樣重要的。我們這個工業合作協會是推動所有的工業合作社工作的樞紐，我們因爲成立了的合作社已有六七百個了，需要對於工業有專長的靑年非常之急，所以很希望大家來踴躍參加。』</p>
<p>這一篇報吿完畢。大家都很感興趣，尤其是各西人記者，他們沒有明瞭的，都爭着發問，由愛利先生一一作答：</p>
<p>問：工業合作社能　　不能？</p>
<p>答：從成立到現在，在經營上還沒有失敗。</p>
<p>問：你預備設立多少個工業合作社？要多少基金？答：從西北到東南預備設立三千個，而基金只需美國國防金三千五百萬美金的百分之一就儘够了</p>
<p>問：現在靠這些合作社生活的人共多少？</p>
<p>答：六千人，還有他們的眷屬。</p>
<p>問：共有多少種類？</p>
<p>答：五十。</p>
<p>問：都和一般的消費合作社兩樣嗎？</p>
<p>答：完全兩樣。</p>
<p>問：你希望來參加工作的，要怎樣的人？</p>
<p>答：能吃苦耐勞，把抗戰建國的責任慨然負担起來的人！（志潮）</p>

<p>【路透社羅馬廿六日電】莫索里尼在此間運動場上法西斯成立廿週年紀念會之演詞、受群衆熱烈喝采、致其演詞之若干部分爲喝采聲所掩、氏稱、「此次慶祝會在歐局嚴重之際舉行、吾人行動不致爲戰爭恐懼心所轉移和平二字現如偽幣之流行、但吾人爲謀歐洲之建設已經長期間之和平矣、外界種種欲推翻柏林、羅馬軸心之企圖、均屬幼稚可笑、柏林羅馬軸心不僅爲兩國間之關係、且爲兩革命之關係、而現代文明即由兩革命而起者也、吾人對於反集權國家之陣綫、將出全力以對付之、中歐發生之事件已成注定之命運、余在熱那亞演說時、卽提及意、法兩國之不同」（此時聽衆發出鄙視法國之擾騷聲）、數日內或數小時內、西班牙國民軍將發出最後一擊、馬德里卽成爲共產主義之墳墓矣、意大利之殖民地問題、已於去年十二月十七日（按當時意國會議員曾高呼殖民地）向法國提出、其中提及突尼斯、吉波的、與蘇彝士、從地理上、政治上、軍事上言之、地中海乃意大利者、故吾人必須實行武裝，今日所謂秩序乃在不顧代價、多造大砲、戰艦與飛機耳、吾人之途徑、業已選定、吾人之主義至爲顯明吾人之革命尙未完成、若從社會風俗品　言之、革命殆尙未開始、吾人過去二十年對於法西斯主義之努力、其成績如何、且留諸他人淸算、惟吾人成績至爲重大、足存留至今後數世紀、此固可斷言者也、吾人雖認爲永久和平乃文明之禍害、然吾人亦認爲長期和平以保證歐洲文明之發展、實屬必要、外間雖請吾人設法促進和平、然當吾人神聖不可侵犯之權利未受他國尊重前吾人當不從事促進和平之舉也、中毆之事件乃注定應發生者、余敢宣吿曰、倘民主國家目覩彼等一手創造之國家、突吿夭折、而痛哭流涕、則吾人不隨之哀悼、實有充分之理由也、惟本問題就道德上言之、當無得加以攻擊、古今歷歷史曾一再證明、倘一民族具有充分之人力、與充分之軍火、而不能耀武揚威、則此表示其民族已成過去、不能勝任其新使命矣」、氏旋提及殖民地問題稱、「此等殖民地問題、包括突尼斯、吉彼的與蘇彝士運河、法政府對於此等一再提出之問題、固可隨意拒絕或僅爲談及然倘因此兩國間鴻溝日深、致難於接合、則彼等當不能再有何申怨，刻局勢不變、吾人希望今後不復聞兄弟國姊妹國（按法意同爲拉丁民族、俗有此等稱呼）之名蓋彼等之關係爲實力之關係、而此等實力之關係乃决定吾人政策之原素也、又吾人所謂地中海、實包括亞的里亞灣、吾人在　　該處之利益、至爲重大、惟吾人不欲排斥該處斯拉夫民族之利益、故過去兩年間、該處維持和平不墜、最根本奢吾人必須武裝、今日所謂秩序乃不顧一切代價、不論任何方法、以多造大砲、戰艦、飛機、卽將所謂國民生活完全排除，亦在所不惜、諸君强大後卽將爲友人所親、爲×人所畏、自洪荒時代以來、世世相傳、綿延不斷之呼聲、厥爲「未武裝者遭殃」同志諸君、諸君身上光榮之褐衣、綴有殷紅如血之顏色、吾人遇國家利益受危害時、卽凖備流血以維護之、今日爲諸君之偉大時日、爲勇敢犧牲及信仰所鼓動、諸君對於歷史之車輪已予以重大推進矣、余今試一問諸君、諸君所希望者爲光榮耶、抑爲安適生活耶、諸君豈覺有何不可能之事耶、諸君尙　吾人之三大信條耶、「信仰、服從、戰鬥」、如是而已、一切勝利之秘訣、盡在此三字中矣」、</p>
<p>【中央社羅馬廿六日電】此間政界人士頃宣稱、莫索里尼首相本日所發表之演說、可使地中海局勢趨于緩和、此種展望、卽使甚爲微弱、要亦未可加以忽視、細味首相演詞、其中關于法意兩國關係一段、最爲重要、蓋已明白表示西班牙問題不復成爲兩國邦交之障碍、今後尙待解决者、厥惟殖民地問題、但首相僅以「問題」爲言，幷未採用「要求」字樣、至所謂殖民地問題、首相雖未切實加以說明、但據消息靈通人士所知、意櫚最低限度之願望、不外下列數端、（一）北非洲法屬突尼斯、意大利僑民在法理上所處地位、應予以改訂、（二）法國以吉波的港通往阿第斯亞貝巴城之鐵路綫讓于意國、（三）法屬吉波的港，應劃出一部份作爲自由港、以供意國利用、（四）减低蘇彝士運河通過費、（五）允許意參預蘇彝士運河管理權、似此所謂意國天然願望、茲已正式以突尼斯、吉波的與蘇彝士運河三者爲對象、此在外交界人士則謂、觀于國王愛麥虞限三世、與莫索里尼首相先後所發表之演說、即知意國現正等候法國首先有所發動、以期重開談判。至首相所由在演詞中涉及亞的里亞海之故、殆欲表示不許第三國揷足于亞的里亞海沿岸、</p>
<p>英方重視　但認無壞影響</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦仕七日電】英索里尼之演詞、雖有若干部分充滿好戰之語氣、但英政界認此演詞、甚有希望、表示法意間問題、可望早日解决、此閒對於莫氏公開要求突尼斯、吉波的、及蘇彝士運河、批評甚多、（一〕莫索里尼與法國賴伐爾在一九三五年訂立協定、而於上年十二月十七日宣佈廢除此協定、規定突尼西亞之意大利人民、有特殊之權利、聞法國凖備承認意大利在該地之特殊地位、然法國經美國之支持、對於威脅　齊泰海軍根據地或英、法所屬非洲重要港口之要求、必加拒絕也、（二）自意大利征服阿比西尼亞後、吉波的予法國之主要價值、業已喪失、而意大利在吉彼的方面之要求、將經法、意雙方商討也、</p>
<p>【倫敦廿七日電】外訊莫索里尼昨晚在羅馬之演講、此間頃加以審愼研究，尚未作何公開評論、此間權威方面在閱讀之後、認爲與日前意王之演講、並無多少差異、對於目下紛亂之歐局、似不至有若何不良影響、莫索里尼力申擁護德、意軸心及闡明意大利之急切需要、此閒認爲殊在意料之中、而正密切加以研討、同時對英索里尼表示企欲歐洲當享長時期和平、則極表欣慰、一般以爲、法、意之間、固尙有談判調整之餘地、因此次莫索里尼演講中、儘力避免激烈字句、二而對法、意談判亦未嘗表示拒絕之意也、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦廿六日電】倫敦各星期報均出特刊、登載莫索里尼演說之主旨顯示英國各界對該演說之重視、至於權威方面最先之反響、則認爲莫氏之說演、並未與意王最近演說所引起之期待相反一般感覺意相此次演說詞雖未嘗稍減往日之强硬鋒芒、但亦毫無足以認爲侵略之語氣、任何人固不敢望其背棄軸心者、然就其詞內語氣觀、則如意王前此所言二固亦熟知意國之特別需要、而表示法意尙可恢復談判以解决一切懸案、關於此層、意相之言、實絕無恫嚇或最後通牒之意義、卽就其所提出之要求、亦無複雜或擴大之情事、英人絕無懷疑地中海或亞的里亞海對意國之重要者、故意相對該問題之言論、在英國方面决無疑慮之必要、莫索里尼所提思想衝突之危險、適與張伯倫最近於前星期四聲言「英國不願在歐造成思想對立之集團」一語、不謀而合，</p>
<p>法國政界　表示討論限度</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎廿七日電】法國認意相莫索里尼演詞之主要意旨、在意大利首次公開提出關於突尼斯、吉波的及蘇彝士運河之要求、而未提及尼斯、薩伏爾及科西嘉諸地、聞法國將乘此機會、經由外交方式、向意重開談判云、</p>
<p>【美聯社巴黎廿七日電】法外長龐萊，縝密研究莫索里尼演講之法文譯稿後、認爲大局并無改變、因莫索里尼仍堅持向法提出要求、故意、法直接談判實不可能、唯莫索里尼固尙未封閉與英、法談判之門、法國人士之意見、對莫索里尼表示地中海與意大利有重要關系、並否認、唯以為法國亦具有同樣重要之關系、因其甚長之海岸線、均在地中海也、官方發言人稱、達拉第總理之政策、未嘗稍變、卽法國决不放寸土是也、莫索里尼所提突尼斯、吉波的及蘇彝士運河三問題、實卽法國之問題、意方要求、如能舍棄土地侵奪、則法國願與之攷慮談判、唯希望與地中海及一般現勢問題有關之國家、能共同成立協定、以解决之、</p>
<p>【中央社巴黎廿六日電】意相莫索里尼本日晨所發表之演說、頃由此間政界人七加以評論云、此公之未發出無可救藥之表示、法意兩國相互關係所遭遇之困難、亦不因而愈益加重、此公旣以去歲渠在熱那亞港所作演詞爲言、足見法意兩國各項懸案、在西國內戰結束之前、實無解决之可能、關于此層、法國原有立場亦無所變更、質言之、蘇彝士運河之管理權、與東非洲法屬吉波的港關係事項、均可提付討論、但以法屬突尼斯境內意國僑民所處地位而言、法國除依照一九三五年法意協定而外、殊無接受他項辦法之理由、此外，莫索里尼首相並指出意國在地中海所當解决之問題，不以法意兩國　案爲限、目謂意國當在亞的里亞海上處于優越地位、此言雖屬委婉、究係警吿德國、勿得對於特裏哀斯晚港（歐戰後曾由前奧國割讓意國現已闢爲自由港）有所舉動，要而言之、莫索里尼首相雖云、中歐洲日前所發生之事變、乃屬不可避免之事變、但未表明此爲柏林、羅馬軸心勝利所在、</p>
<p>美國官方　發生良好印象</p>
<p>【美聯社華盛頓廿七日電】此間官方及財政界，對於莫索里尼之演說、有良好之印象、因其演詞之若干部分、語氣緩和、表示法、意間各項懸案、仍可應用外交途徑、以獲得解决、參議員克勞台柏培氏稱、意相之演詞、表示目前之危機、尙有和平解决之可能也、</p>
<p>【美聯社紐約廿七日電】此間「論壇前驅」報今日著文、對於認莫索里尼演詞爲「緩和」者提出警吿、略謂、希特勒於一月十三日、發表被認爲緩和之演說、然隨後卽發生倂呑捷克之舉、莫索里尼演詞含有積極之聲明、决不可認爲緩和、現歐洲仍無眞正之安全、唯目前之危機、或已獲救矣、</p>
<p>德發言人　仍在推波助浪</p>
<p>【路透社柏林廿七日電】此間外報登一授意之宣言謂、「意大利現已由其政府之領袖明白表示關於突尼斯，吉波的及蘇伊士之歷史上要求、故規避答　之可能性、將不復存在矣」、</p>
<p>【路透社柏林廿六日電】此聞對於莫索里尼之演說、表示熱烈擁護與贊同、某發言人稱，「莫索里尼曾顯明的表示，和平並非無條件的保留以往事實、如不准舊居之重建者、建造新屋、在所必行、如英國悍然發動戰爭，其最終結果、恐亦不能一如往昔也」、</p>
<p>【美聯社柏林廿六日電】此間批評莫索里尼之演詞謂「意首相之演說、乃答擭一切包圍集　國家之企圖、法國現必須明白答復意大利之地中海要求也」、</p>

<h3 id="c26">論南昌失守與今後戰局 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>贛北劇戰十日，我軍自動退出南昌。</p>
<p>溯自去年七月九江失守以後，南昌即已三面受脅，岌岌可危，卒能頑强堅持達半年以上，不能不歸功於贛北皖南及贛湘鄂邊將士之堅持×後戰鬥、而今日在×軍七十二小時的殘酷轟炸與大規模的毒氣進攻之下，我軍被迫整師而退，在整個戰略上看來，絕無奇怪可言。</p>
<p>×軍這次的「南昌攻略」，曾有整個的計劃，其目的在消滅我南昌一帶的主力，擴大東南諸省的「掃蕩戰」，但在這次南昌攻略中，他依然被迫作爭城市爭交通綫之戰，而對於我軍主力，則未能加以任何傷書，反之他們雖然强佔南昌，而其所動員的華中精銳，則已零星地被我截斷，抵住，和圍住，他們不僅沒有完成其『南昌攻略』的預定計劃，並且使華中各部隊陷於更太的困境。反之我軍則保持全部力量，能够運動自如，能够隨時予×以打擊。</p>
<p>但同時，我們也不能不認淸，南昌是我們江南僅存的重要城市，現在南昌失陷，浙贛鐵路截斷，東南戰塲與華西根據地的聯繫遭受更大的困難。反之，×人方面，佔得南昌以後，如果進一步完成其與皖贛鄂區的聯絡，則進可以長　長沙一切斷粤漢路，退可以鞏固東南佔領區，從事于『掃蕩』戰和進一步侵略的準備。</p>
<p>我們明白南昌失守之不致影響整個戰局，和×人强佔南昌之必然增加其困難，我們同時要提防南昌失守以後可能發生的新的困難，因此我們在今日還須在聞敗勿餒的原則下，提高我們的警惕性，實施必要的對策。</p>
<p>第一，從南昌之失，可以證明×軍戰斗力雖在日漸衰落，但還有繼續進攻的力量，這種進攻力量的高度發揮，仍舊可以陷我名城重鎭，不過今後每一高度發揮的結果，其力量必更衰落，觀乎徐州武漢至南昌陷落之時間距離即可明白，因此我們今日的任務，必須是努力增强前綫的戰門力，發展×後的游擊戰，制止×人的進攻，推進抗戰的第二階段即相持階段。</p>
<p>第二，根據第一點，我們今日必須反對糊塗的架空的樂觀論者，我們要提高對於×人新進攻新陰謀的警惕性，我們要求軍事上政治上更大的進步，始能渡過最後敗亡的難關。同時根據上述第一點，卽×人力量每一要高度的發揮，其衰落亦必更激劇，所以我們更須努力粉碎一切漢奸親日份子失敗主義之「和平妥協」論調以及一切悲觀失望情緒的再度抬頭。因爲×人正在藉其孤注一擲所換得的虛僞的「勝利」，以欺騙其國人，以誘脅我降服，這是我們更須警防的。</p>
<p>第三，×人強占南昌以后，對於正在東南各省發動廣大游擊戰爭的新四軍及其友軍，固然是一大威脅，而×人對東南各省的軍事與政治的壓力必更加嚴重；同時×人占領長沙以致打通粤漢路的攻略亦有立卽提出可能。我們爲要粉碎×人進一步的冒險，首先必須以大量運動兵團，增援皖南浙西，衝入皖贛邊及鄂湘贛邊×後各區，阻止×軍的運動並加以分解與打擊。而鑒于東南與西部的隔絕，更應賦予東南抗日軍隊與民衆以建立抗日總根據及抗日地方政府的權力，像冀察晉邊區一樣發揮東南抗戰力量。，仍是×人新進攻的基本方針。因此我們同時不能忽視×人的「西北西南」攻略，尤其是要加緊西南的警備！</p>

<p>我國空軍在歷史上說來、雖然仍是很幼稚、可是在這次神聖抗×戰爭中、我空軍一以當十英勇作戰的雄姿、早已被世界各國所認識、所稱道、他們給予侵略者以毫不容情的打擊、同時吿訴各國、我空軍是偉大的、是不可侮的、</p>

<p>戰事以來、中央宣傳部的中央電影攝影場裏底工作人員、時常出入於南北東西各戰場、將前綫悲壯雄偉、可歌可泣的實情、通過了鏡頭、膠片、運輸而映入於後方廣大的民衆眼簾內、現在更有一部以空軍爲題材的「長空萬里」影片了、不久就要開始拍攝了、編劇是「大路」的導演孫瑜先生、事前中宣部曾商請航空委員會派員共同參加此攝片、編導、技術工作、航空委員會就派在假的航空員謝濤濬君協助、謝君曾說、「……當他（指孫瑜）誠懇地埋頭於這部影片的編劇工作的時候、我便在他旁邊幫助他、吿訴他一些關於中國空軍的故事、和空軍駕駛、作戰技術上的各種問題、我是一個飛行員、我不懂怎樣寫一個好劇本，但我知道怎樣駕駛飛機、怎樣和×人作戰、怎樣保衛祖國的領空、我要把這些事貢獻給電影界、還有、便是我要正確地說出我的伙伴們的鬥爭、英勇的和犧牲的壯烈情形、這些、編劇者是要把來作爲他的描寫的人物底對象用的、……」</p>
<p>本片攝成後在重慶公映、以後便將運往華西各大城市以及南洋各地、使熱心愛國的華僑、看看祖國空軍的新姿態、本港或亦有放映之望，</p>
<p>演員男的是高占非和趙丹、女主角白楊、並有許多空軍戰士將在片中和我們相見、</p>

<p>秀蘭鄧波兒今年我願努力使我對於算學發生興趣、並且還得好好地去學它、</p>
<p>宋雅海妮</p>
<p>我將極力提倡游泳、網球、溜冰等各種運動，使全世界人士都能對於體育發生興趣，愛好運動的人都有健全的體魄、有了强健的身體、不論做什麽事都很有精神、未來的幸福便跟着來臨了、</p>
<p>泰隆鮑華</p>
<p>我願能早日再往南美洲去旅行一次、南美的巴西人和阿根廷人眞是何等和善可愛呀、唐阿米契我願能多抽出些時光和我的兩個孩子和我們心愛的狗玩要、</p>
<p>洛麗泰楊</p>
<p>我願今年少拍些片子、多讀些書、多看幾次舞台劇、到古巴等地去旅行一次、</p>

<h3 id="c57">五花八門的　明星宣傳手段　（續） <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>明星們的出生地點、有時爲了宣傳計也不得不換上一個、歌唱明星洛埃洛吉斯向以牧童姿態演出的、在進影界時改變他的出生地爲戚奧明洲的哥代（Cody），那是以西部牧童出名的地方、可是後來來了一位貨眞價實的哥代牧童、說起他從未聽到過這樣一個人、洛吉斯纔不得不承認他是從奧海沃州來的、雪格烈歌麗使全世界都相信了她是生於挪威的、可是現在也承認了布洛克林是她的誕生地，</p>
<p>琪恩亞晚萊不拍戲時也穿着牧童服裝、這樣別人就很容易在許多人之中認出他來了、而且牧童的衣服又是如此的觸目、遠在半里以外都看出是他來、宋雅海尼剛來好萊塢時、並不爲人所注意，於是她摒棄一切雜色的衣服、老是穿純白色的、駕着一輛也是純白色的車子、於是吸引人注意起來了、</p>
<p>每隔一個相當的時期、總有幾個外國演員宣稱他們要入美國藉了、這也是一個好法子，記着露意絲蕾納嗎、她取得了美國公民資格後、用一面美國國旗把自己包了起來、以示她心中的快樂、當時這張照片被拍了去、這是很好的宣傳工具、美國影迷誰不希望那些外國明星入美國藉呢、</p>
<p>連小小的營火虫也被利用了、瓊裴納就曾經官稱過她要收集一大批的螢火虫養在園裏、同這個差不多的還有平克勞斯貝和飽勃彭斯兩人的「靑蛙競跳」比賽一事</p>
<p>其他的方法正多，黛尼兒達麗安向上梳的髮型、瓊蘭在七天晚上連換七個男伴、賈克本尼去年表示不再表演、瑪琳黛維斯有過一次宴會、邀請客人很多、名單在報紙上幾乎佔去了一整面的地位、曼麗璧克　說她的屋子裏出鬼、這些無非都是宣傳手段而已、有些說穿了簡直不値一笑、</p>
<p>女星們常常做些柔軟運動，專爲拍宣傳照片、不作別用，不久之前梅兒奧白朗有過一張在沙灘上奔跑的照片，別的無可疵議，然而看看她的脚、穿的還是三寸的高跟鞋、</p>
<p>明星們常常往外地度過『假期』、紐約是最好的去處、紐約人終日忙碌、所見到的都是陌生的新臉子、但是若有他們所熟識的臉于在紐約發見、他們也很願意看看的、克拉克蓋勃爾、羅拔泰勒和泰隆鮑華就常上紐約去、目的正是在宣傳、</p>
<p>宣傳有時候常給明星們以很大的煩惱、它拆散一對熱戀中的男女明星、—如泰隆飽華和安娜蓓拉—而把漠不關情的一對强行撮台，假裝他們是互相愛着—像李却格林和安娜泰露意絲——、它努力在報紙上宣揚，使人相信明星確有點和常人不同的怪癖、像說露莎蓮洛莎兒養了一打大蛙在運池裏、治好了她的失眠症那樣、</p>
<p>太多了、完全寫出來幾乎可以著一本專書、爲了宣傳、它們會做出許多古裏八怪的事、演員之所以爲演員者，其在此乎？</p>

<h3 id="c59">星華足球隊　昨自菲乘機抵港　一行二十一人軍容甚盛　在菲第五戰二比零擊敗全菲隊 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>【本報快訊】星洲中華足球隊、應菲賓律方面邀請、前往比賽、該隊係於本月十三日自星動程、抵菲後、由十七至廿六之十日間、出戰五次、四勝一敗、成績堪稱美滿</p>
<p>在菲賽畢、順道來港、訂定三場大戰、由南華體育會主理一切、蓋該隊此來、乃南華負責招待、</p>
<p>該隊一行廿一人、初意欲卅一日自菲乘中國飛剪號客機來港、但因該機改期四月二日啓航、故於昨晨七時半改乘「飛行酒店」巨型波音機加利福尼亞飛剪號前來、午間十二時半、抵達啟德飛機場海面停泊、到場歡迎者、有南華會職員莫慶、張文洞、李惠堂及中西記者多人、</p>
<p>原定領隊沈覜斗、臨時因事未偕隊出發、改推鄧約翰領隊兼訓練、秘醫曹秋林、隊長許厚坤、副隊長紀友齡、一行名單如下、</p>
<p>領隊兼訓練：鄧約翰</p>
<p>秘書：曹秋林</p>
<p>隊長：許　坤</p>
<p>副隊長：紀友齡</p>
<p>隊員：李柏棠　馮惠文</p>

<p>温關宗　龍烈武</p>
<p>李海珠　何國才</p>
<p>關信德</p>
<p>全體職球員、下榻勝斯酒店三〇五號房、據許隊長對記者稱、在菲五戰、本有全勝可能，惟第三戰因有數球員負傷豋場、致遭敗績云</p>
<p>查全菲聯賽冠軍、是屆爲YCO隊所得、（月前來港作埠際賽之菲隊隊長兼左內鋒鮑賽利及左翼必治、乃該隊台柱、）星華隊在菲第四戰、則遇該隊、以三比一挫之、第五戰與全菲隊會師、亦以二比零得勝、準此以觀、足證星華隊實力甚强、此次來港、定有偉大之貢献、一飽島上球迷眼福、</p>
<p>該隊最擅短傳戰略、合作功夫極佳、（凡一足球隊擅於短傳者、合作功夫必佳、）各員又氣充力足、頭球尤爲出色、故其榮膺星洲兩屆聯賽冠軍、良非倖致者、出征時、彼以勞疲之師、而臨全菲之精銳、竟凈勝二球、其球藝高超可知矣、</p>
<p>征菲戰績</p>

<p>公開男子籃球賽、昨晚共有三塲舉行、首場乙組廣中戰太古、廣中實力較太古强、開賽後，會啟榮、梁賡昌、馮自强、先後射球種鵠、太古竭力爭持、馮棋洪金鸞、謝培三路反攻、頻傳捷報、然後不償失、半塲廣中以卅三比十二佔勝、易地交鋒、廣中馮植、謝培、李周楨、馬澤洪、均有所獲，太古勉强應付、疲于擋架、遂以卅六比五十九失敗、</p>
<p>次塲港大戰華南、港大實力遠遜南華、惟諸人奮勉從事、自始至終、以六員戰將應付、南華則生力軍源源開到，爭持甚烈、戰端開啓後、張少勉、鄭煜坤先後攻球、果不辱命，極力反攻、亦有所獲、惟南華聯絡甚佳、控制得法、上半時吿終、南華以廿四比十二先捷、易地再戰、張少勉策馬渡河、立建奇動、石振智揭干而起、左右抄擊、亦數次中籃、港大反攻、當不得逞、且陷於四面楚歌中、鳴金收軍時、港大以卅七比六敗、宋場乙組南華戰靑支、南華前鋒聯絡得宜、且投籃準確、靑支竭力抵抗、終以實力較殊、以四十四比六十喪師、各戰成績如下、</p>

<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>度過了農歷年關、香江足球國裏竟忙到不得開交、本身的各項錦標賽、已到了緊鑼密鼓的時期、此外還熙熙攘攘、送往迎來、菲律賓方面的足球嘉賓、才于上月份了手、星洲中華足球隊、又乘征菲歸途之便、經港一　熱鬧、預備在這裏作三塲表演、飽　我們的眼福了、這消息已傳出了許多時、他們這囘不辭跋沙、連道光臨，自然是本港球國衆生、引願期待着的、又何况他們是親切的海外同胞、誼屬手足、我們大家份屬主人、應如何献出了熱洪烘的心情、來表露我們降階倒履的歡迎美意、應如何盡我們維護照拂的責任、使他們有賓至如歸的安寧，</p>
<p>他們這番應征召征菲、經過了幾囘大戰、成續還算美滿、我相信他們在港的表演、一定可以一新吾人眼界、不致使人失望、不過、一個外征的足球隊、少不免有時會因爲旋間傷疲和厭戰心理的關係、在以勞臨逸的形勢下、不容易達到全隊或個人的藝術最高峯，所以我們如果將來鑒賞或批評他們的球藝時、別忘記把這一點事實夾進去、才可的當地產生那估量的眞價値、</p>
<p>在遭裏我得警吿一聲、我們港方球友千萬不要小觀這一隊「出自名門」的猛將、因爲筆者廿年來走通了南洋和東半球一帶、感覺到僑界足球的技能，要算馬來亞之星洲、吉隆坡、怡保，和荷東印之泗水、吧城諸地爲最高明，僑胞大體上對足球的旨趣、也以上述各地爲最崇尙、而星洲華隊的球藝、平均上比較他埠尤勝一籌、爲的星洲是交通要樞、華洋雜處、除了天氣外實與香島小異大同、那裏的足球國，有英倫之海陸空三軍、歐、美、華、巫人士所組成的隊伍、連年爭逐、互鬥短長，所以他們的足球、是超乎水準之上、和本港的程度　　起來、眞是軒　難分、何况這中華隊是連捷兩屆星洲聯賽的盟主、羣堆中的翹楚、各個身手之不同凡響，大可想像而知、那　我們輕視、</p>
<p>還記得一九二八年那年、馬來亞華聯隊（星洲球員佔大半）刊香島來作第一屆和和杯競賽，在中西觀衆的熱烈讃美聲中，僅以三二一球之微、負給本港華聯隊、他們爐火純靑的球技、留下了最深刻的一個好印象、這便是他們破題兒乘風破浪、歸國觀光第一遭、到一九卅一·二·年、跟著又有馬華星華兩隊先後返國、在港滬粤各地表演過好幾囘、一九三五年、馬華在上海第六屆全運會奪得亞軍、（香港冠軍在半决賽中三比二勝馬華）、都有佳妙的演出、和超羣的戰續、使人每念不忘、而他們精神飽滿、處處　全體育道德、也値得我們欽珮和仿範的、（明日續完）</p>

<p>連天陰雨，網球賽因而停頓者、已有多天、至昨日天忽放晴、網球賽遂得繼續舉行、個中迷民多蒞場觀戰、計雙打兩場、單打三場、雙打林添黃　熙勝士多利及花架臣、林珍兄弟勝那錫及文僚、單打哥羅福勝余彼得、洪滑釗則自動棄權、何家流不勞而獲、湯連遜則挫林坤、雙打林黃對士多利花架臣一場、頗覺可觀、十花兩人、氣力充足、故初時攻勢甚銳、林黃大受威脅、後黃林步步爲營、改取攻勢、士花一對漸無法應付、卒以見敗、林珍兄弟對那錫及文僚一場、林氏兄弟技術高超、合拍得法、那文一對當然非其敵手，但第二盆比賽當中、那文二人、當極力掙扎、圖挽已倒之狂瀾、無如珍林兄弟、毫不放鬆、乃復遭挫折、單打則以湯連遜對林坤一場、頗具精彩、戰時林常步步跟追、抵抗甚力、但卒以藝不如人、乃遭失敗、</p>

<h3 id="c64">我國體育界前途的荊棘 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>雖然我們常説「大事化小事、小事化無事」、但正如積水成塘、小錯亦能鑄成大錯、欲淸除我國體育界前途的荆棘、亦不可忽視所　徵小的錯誤、</p>
<p>我國體育界前途的荆棘實不勝枚舉、但剷草必須除根、欲淸除我國體育界前途的荆棘並不是一件困難的事，困難的就是除根、這種荆棘的根源也最常爲一般人所忽視、</p>
<p>我們都知道體育對於抗戰的重要，普通人不提倡體育尙情有可原、但所謂體育界或教育界的人如蔑視體育的重要、則結果將很嚴重、如不僅不提倡、反而妨礙體育的發展、當更可痛心、的確、尤其是在敎育界和職業的體育界中、因自私、嫉恨、虛榮、甚至利令智昏、在無形之中、使我國體育界遭受重大的挫折、關於這種情形、我可以舉出下列幾個很顯明的例子、</p>
<p>體育館的設立在我國不僅落後、且多數由外人主持、間雖有由國人設立者、但設備甚爲簡陋、我們固不可因此對他們起蔑視之心、還須儘力維護他們、這樣的才不失提倡體育的宗旨、但事實上却不是如此、普通人輕視他們也許是對體育缺乏相當的認識、但是不少負有提倡體育的責任的人、常因自私、嫉恨、蔑視、虛榮、甚至利令智昏，不僅不維　各種尙在萌芽的體育事業、並「吹毛求疵」、故作惡意的批評、以各種卑鄙齷齪的手段、阻礙其發展、對於那些比他們更有成就的人嫉恨尤甚、但是我們也要知道在體育界中尙有一班自負自大、不求改進、祗是賣野人頭或江湖式的體育專家、凡此種種、皆能在無形之中給體育界一個重大的打擊、</p>
<p>在此種職業的體育界中、所以有許多人置體育精神於不顧，最大的原因也是飯碗問題、但是很奇怪的、這種情形也常見於各學校、各敎育機關、或甚至在同一文化機關之間、</p>
<p>在學校之間、我可以舉出一佃很顯明的實例、從前在我國某大城市有兩所大學的足球隊作錦標决賽、甲校因被罰十二碼球而以一球見負於乙校、比賽完畢後、甲校球員竟遷怒於裁判員動武毆打、須知裁判員雖有不公之處、亦非必爲偏袒乙校之故、凡人作事總不免有多少過失，况比賽勝負原爲提倡體育；若因此不能加以原諒、毆打裁判員實　犯體育精神、但事後、甲校體育主任不僅未訓誡動武的球員反而偏袒他們、</p>
<p>此雖與飯碗無關、但主因亦無非自私、嫉恨與虛榮、</p>
<p>總之提倡體育、一方面要分工合作、一方面也要互相扶助、互相勉勵、方能收事半功倍之效、自私和嫉恨等最足爲分工合作的障礙、</p>
<p>友人某君對於各種最有效的健身方法有深切的研究、著譯甚爲豊富、並有近十年的經驗、先後造就不少強健的靑年。我在他指導之下、於體力方面、單就『兩臂立正推舉』（Two-arm　militaly　press）的成續在一年之內由六十五磅增至一百三十五磅。此雖全爲我個人的經騐、但由此可以證明某君在我國體育界中實有相常的貢獻。</p>
<p>最近某君主辦某種體育事業、此種事業雖不敢過早估計其價値、但在我國却爲首創、某君初辦此事、當不免常感困難、及至今日、雖贊掦與鼓勵備至，但蔑視　諷之者亦頗不乏人</p>
<p>在此種事業開始進行時、卽有人對其起萬視之心、亦有人誤會其宗旨、究謂在目前局勢之下、實無須多此一舉、亦有　之爲「小創作」、甚至有輕視其應有的價値者、除非「賣野人頭」、凡事皆須按步就班、穩紮穩打、先賢立堅强的基礎，不可因其「小」而對其起蔑視之心、况「小創作」總較「不創作」為好、至於吹毛求疵本係國人的通病、某君新辦的事業、又豈能倖免、、於是不相干的枇評、亦不免常常遇到、</p>
<p>所幸某君堅強的意志、並不因此而動搖、仍抱原有宗</p>
<p>其實失收爲成功之母、凡事要「創作」無論其爲怎樣「小的創作」總不能免有多少錯誤，只要過則勿憚改、認定目標，勝勿驕、敗勿餒、努力邁進、結果絕不致毫無成就的、</p>
<p>體育的範圍很廣，單就運動方面言、足球敎練對於籃球不一定也有研究。但是却有許多人自命爲全才體育家、甚或對體育毫無研究的人、也常喜作武斷的批評、這實在是體育發展的大障礙。要希望我國體育有長足進步、這種風氣是不可不矯正的。</p>
<p>總之、欲矯正這種幣病圾風要的是格人和道德的問題。</p>

<h3 id="c69">論保留面目 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 春風</p>
<p>陸樹聲　暑筆談有云：</p>
<p>「臨海金一所責亨，僊居應容庵大猷二人，以道義相友善，金旣謝事家居，應復起用，詣金言別，金曰君出他日囘來，要將一照樣應容庵還我，兩人竟保晚節」。</p>
<p>像金一所和應容庵這兩個以道義交的朋友，在金出山做官的時候，還諄諄以保存原來面目爲勗，那麽其他同時代好朝夕遷　，不存眞面目的人，大槪也不難由此想知，可見今日時代下的卑身曲節，好改變面目的人，也不足以苛責了。</p>
<p>一般地說來，中國古代儒者，多以避居山林爲淸高，脫出廟庭爲最値得稱譽的事，就如唐代的賀知章辭官返里，不止全朝的公卿大夫都　自出來送別，就尊爲天子的國君也作文作詩的嘉勗，一時文人學土也莫不以此事作爲寫詩唱和的資料。其實像這種辭官不做返里的獨善其身的事，已經失去了儒者以天下爲己任的本色了，更不必大吹大擂的廣事宜傳。不過雖然有的讀書人能跳出獨善其身的臼窩，與天下之民共其憂樂，但是能保持其本來面目眞能本着良心，爲民謀福的確很少見，由此推得，一般儒者之所以寧願隱居山林，不願到廟庭，大概說來，或許都是自量德薄，不勝利慾，於是才揀定了退隱的這條消極路，由此更可推得像淸暑筆談所記的金之勉應要將一個舊樣的本色保住也確是本了自知之　。</p>
<p>今日的　識階級，似乎較古時文人更下流，昨日還是「中央中央」的發表談話，明天就已經是狄方的幕中人了，真是干變萬化，大有「其猶龍乎」之槪。再還一點的例子，就如七七之前還是以著書立說傳誨　年的學者敎授，如今有許多已經是僞組織的新貴，人也鬼也，變得眞快，古詩所說的「山中方七日，世上幾千年」的遷盤，形容起來也有來不及之嫌。而最　下流的是明知德薄，不勝利慾的誘惑，但依然往官廳名利塲中擠，到了某個眼度，失節破身，落得　寄身逃逋。有的更卑鄙不足道的，竟是在失節破身寄身外人勢力下，喘息未定之餘，還是大幹下賤生涯，追逐名利，這不止已經失去本來面目，甚而是已經變了原形化，化狐化狗了。</p>
<p>淸暑筆談仍有云：</p>
<p>「昔王嘉叟與王龜齡別曰吾輩會合不可常，惟常留而目，異時可復相見」。</p>
<p>這詁較前文所引的更為深刻了，假使眞的是昨日是人，明日變狗的話，朋友不止不敢相認，甚而致於羣暍「打狗」了，這毫不是揑造的假話，有事可證。</p>
<p>以上所引的兩段文學，是否可以取來作爲今人的勉語呢？答案是：絲毫不能—因爲今天已投降的士大夫階級，和無恥文人，並失意政客，他們本早已棄祖宗於不顧，迎主子於胸懷，避到外國地，專門接待日本人，臭面目完全無條件的現露出來，還談什麽保留面目。今人古人之不同，大概在此罷。</p>
<h3 id="c70">雨夜 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 林螢牕</p>
<p>深夜。大地是黑壓壓地；萬物停滯在靜寂里。只有長脚細雨點；晶瑩的閃爍着，浙瀝地低吟着。模糊的窗面上沾滿絲綫條和細粒兒，但時而變得很粗，時又像掌形的大點。剛才關窻的指痕；還依稀辨得出。</p>
<p>沙沙的微聲已逐漸變成滴答的亂響。那油燈也搖曳地放出那綠得滲淡的微光。我底文思已經給搗成碎絲而分散了。煩悶驅着我打開窗檻，手還未縮回來，家鄕的雨　已浮現腦中：盆雨打在翡翠似的石階上，狂風在空庭迴　着，受摧殘的芭蕉在瑟繩，受風吹的庭梧像不能忍受地抖顫；鷄兒在窠里閣閣地吵，貓兒妙妙地叫，慈靄的母親頻頻在喚添衣，我彷彿囘去了，把壞的全都淸除，好的活的全給保留！把門戶緊　着，永不敎任何東西來權燬！</p>
<p>風，　索地送着颯颯的絲雨，擊破我底幻夢。</p>
<p>擺在我底眼前的是一盞屹立的街燈。一輛黃包車影貼在油亮的街沿，枯瘦的車夫坐在車墊沉思，若不勝愁鬱似的。</p>
<p>風更大了，面進每一角落，觸若車夫的肉身，馳過　樓底下露宿者地床的邊緣，吹醒他們孕滿希　的好夢。他們終於無力地蠕動着；悄悄地喚起窮朋友妻子，捲起紙褥蔴皮，緩慢地走進厠所裏去。雖則骯髒潮溼，可是温煖！</p>
<p>一陣似　似繼的汽笛頻饗後，飛濺的泥濘趕跑了事夫，一股香氣跟風在迴騰。無疑地他們又將投在安琪兒翅膀下，用酒，女人來消耗這風雨之夜！</p>
<p>雨，多罪惡！我憎恨。我氣　地拉緊窗門。想像的斷片又擠滿腦海，由都市到鄕村，由後方到淪陷區，終而到前綫，這似乎是我底出路，所以它會給留得較深較多的印象。</p>
<p>春雨該是纏綿地飄打着。濘滑的泥土會舖滿　場。尖峭的風　這個森林捲到那個森林。將士緊着槍，守哨，偵察，襲　……血和水在匯流，千萬點的珠水像國人掉淚。呼嘯地風像祭者的哀號。啊，壯烈，偉大！這爲了國族而鬥爭的一羣！……</p>
<p>——　個角落，也許一羣人流淚在思鄉：「這春雨該是灌培櫻的開放吧，海的那邊的櫻花，可有那以往艷麗的姿容？也許枯黃吧，也許死掉！……死掉了萬餘人，大坂的怒火。六萬婦女來華！我那親愛底家人，妻子，也許葬在怒火，也許給……那定做的三萬五千個屍灰袋，將來也許就把我盛着……戰爭，　個什麼東西？…</p>
<p>想到這裏，雨又多偉大！我深深地的愛上它，我興奮。</p>

<p>— 唐英偉</p>
<p>遙遠的海，吹來一陣祖國的風，在這黃昏中，懷念祖國的人們都患起傷感病了。</p>
<p>穿過五方雜處的街道，走出　煙臭味的大馬路，海邊的風景綫依然是令人尋味的。——放開胸　吸吸收還從祖國吹來的海風吧！可是在近視眼鏡中的九龍，像在烽火濃烟中蒙着一層迷露×××××的人們，依然　脫不了一付哭喪臉在暮色中更淸楚的轉動着兩隻死白的眼睛。</p>
<p>誰願自己離開自己的祖國呢？這是誰也意想不到的一囘事啊！在生活的索子的覊絆中，每一顆鮮血淋漓的心己消沉在這孤島上了。每一個活躍的靈魂，已在賤價的拍賣中幻減了。</p>
<p>流綫型汽車交織着夜行網，衝出鴿字籠的人們有如决提的洪水一樣奔騰着。叫囂着。失去了祖國的靈魂的人們啊！使人不免懷着如果沒有黃昏的時候，這入潮不知要海湧到什麽的黑暗的地方去的感慨了。</p>
<p>點綴在地獄上的樂土。公園便是孤島上的天堂了。懷着異國情調的聖女們，眾着面網，在這暮色中，閃着兩隻有如星星的眼睛。這也許就是天父的遣使麽？可是天父的天使呢？沒有了祖國的孩子們，並不以爲十字架就是他所喜愛的禮物啊！在不同籍籍的小孩子羣中。抗戰的歌聲却變成日慕的繁響了。</p>
<p>沉重的鐘聲在響着。孤島跟着在蛻化了。</p>

<p>— 魏飛</p>
<p>近來　直一些專也不能做，鄰屋那女子，每天張大着喉嚨，很高興，很快樂地在唱：男喉，女喉，花旦，武生，二黃，西皮……我都聽得　熟了，然而，我却一點感不到高興，快樂，反覺得心痛，悲哀。</p>
<p>旣不能做事，順手找着一張報紙來看，「眞假武則天」，五個紅色的大字，像閃電般立卽觸着我的視覺，頓時一呆，頗覺啼笑皆非，再從最注目的地方，最醒眼的廣吿　，看見三行驚人的字樣：「最香艷，最肉感，最淫蕩」，呵，我的手一鬆，　在椅上，報紙落在　面。</p>
<p>昨晚磁過那戲院時、很多人——男的，女的，老的。學生，工人……圍着在看，廣吿上又是那三行最誘人的字句，在那邊還寫着：『欲免向隅，睛早定座』，不　，售票處分明掛着『頭二場滿座』的牌子，但還很多人擠進去，走到售票處一看，嘴唇微微的掀動，帶着失望的眼光，走到廣吿的面前，迷着眼睛在那三句字上打轉，有些走到卽日放映下的畫片前，望着望着。</p>
<p>得數月前，我到一家二等戲院去看『台免在』，鄰近的一家是放映「三千女明星」，在同樣的票價下，雖然「台兒莊」是滿座，可是那家的門口却有很多人站在一個半裸的？女明星的廣吿下，同　帶着失望的眼光，望着，他們居然「向隅」了。</p>
<p>我帶着悲哀的心情，觸着脚頭的拖着沉重的脚步，在歸途的路上慢慢走着，一邊想，「電影是教育的工具，從事電影的人，無異從事敎育的人」，想到這，我又連想到那鄰屋的女于。</p>
<p>她，近來變了，粉白了面孔，抹上了胭脂，染紅了指甲，塗上血紅的唇廣，常常從裏邊跳到外邊，從外邊跳到裏邊，口在唱着從電影上學來的歌：</p>

<p>「唔吼，喚吼，唔吼……我一呀……概唔……」</p>
<p>她有閒便和人談劇情，說這明星好，那明星靚，那戲怎樣悲楚，守節，那戲怎樣孝順，乞米養家姑，這是多感動人呵！這些都深深的刻在她的腦中，她會牢牢的記着，記着，也會重重的受了它　繞，別的一切，她却忘了，連她從前說的一句話：『炸，炸，儘管炸中國永遠是要抗戰的」，也忘却了。</p>
<p>我常爲她担心，不，不止她，很多很多從祖國的懷抱裏，從敵人的矗炸下，從槍林彈雨的戰區中，逃難出來的人們，彷彿，看一個個男的，女的，老的，幼的，逃出了戰區，投人這「香港海」，給海的一浪濤』沉沒下去似的</p>

<p>— Zhu Boquan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Boquan's position in the domestic financial world is well known to readers. His observations on the dynamics of the Shanghai financial market during the war, from the perspective of an insider, are more profound and detailed than those of the average person. Therefore, we are eager to publish them. We hope readers will pay attention. Editor</p>
<p>1. Foreword</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major commercial port in China, holding the financial hub of the entire country. According to various statistics, as of the end of June 1937, the number of banks in Shanghai accounted for more than 32% of the total number of banks in the country (excluding branch banks). Among them, the paid-up capital of the 41 member banks accounted for 45% of the total paid-up capital of banks in the country, and the total assets accounted for 44.5% of the national total. Various deposits accounted for about 76% of the national bank deposits, excluding the Central Bank and other non-member banks. In addition, there are foreign banks, native banks, trust companies, silver firms, savings societies, and other financial organizations. Foreign banks and native banks, in particular, have a long history and deep influence in the Shanghai financial market, forming a three-legged balance of power with Chinese banks.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Shanghai financial community has suffered greatly, so it has been striving to improve. For example, after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Shanghai banking and native banking industries successively established the United Reserve Association. Later, the banking industry established a clearing house and an acceptance house, strengthening solidarity and increasing strength. In November 1935, the currency system was reformed, concentrating the silver that controlled the national economic lifeline, unifying issuance, and further stabilizing the financial foundation. This achievement had already demonstrated its effectiveness before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and its value can be fully demonstrated during the war.</p>
<p>2. The Financial Market Before and After the Outbreak of War</p>
<p>In the first half of 1937, the general economic situation in the country showed a booming atmosphere. Since the currency system reform in 1935, general prices began to rise, and industry and commerce were stimulated by the price increases, showing a prosperous scene. Transactions in various markets were frequent, which was rare in recent years. In the first half of 1937, the total amount of Shanghai bank note exchanges increased by one-sixth compared to the same period last year, and the financial situation was also extremely stable. Interbank lending rates hovered around 10% interest. The foreign exchange market situation was consistently controlled by government banks, and stability was exceptional. The public debt market price reached over 89 yuan in June. The deposit and lending business of the banking industry also increased consistently. Unexpectedly, the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, shocking the market. The Shanghai Hongqiao Airport Incident followed, and a full-scale war between China and Japan unfolded.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, the first to be affected was the Shanghai financial community. The public debt market situation has declined sharply since July 7th. It was common for the exchange to suspend trading several times a day. Until the settlement period in July, the government stipulated a minimum price of 70 yuan to stabilize the situation. At that time, those who doubted the legal tender纷纷纷纷提取存欵,购买外汇或转存外商银行,资金逃避,爲数甚鉅. In early August, the situation in Shanghai became more serious, and the trend of withdrawals became even more intense. When the Shanghai Battle broke out on August 13th, Shanghai suddenly became a war zone, and people were panicked and uncontrollable. All exchanges were the first to suspend trading, and the banking industry was also ordered to suspend business for four days from August 13th. In order to maintain finance, the Ministry of Finance specially announced measures to stabilize finance, restricting withdrawals. At the same time, the banking industry formulated supplementary measures to utilize the exchange system and determine the method of note remittance, which mitigated the financial panic. From August 17th, the banking industry resumed business across the board. Although there were still many people requesting withdrawals, they were limited. However, because the four banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) lending associations and the Banking Association's United Reserve Association had methods for regulating the industry, they were able to cope with it easily, and people's minds tended to stabilize. By the end of the year, many depositors of various banks and native banks had redeposited the funds they had previously withdrawn. According to the Ministry of Finance's measures to stabilize finance, those who deposited legal tender in banks and native banks or opened new accounts after the war could withdraw legal tender at any time without restriction. At the same time, because the pre-war current deposits, in addition to the withdrawal limit, could be circulated with interbank remittance notes, the amount of deposits in each bank was not greatly reduced. At that time, the market situation generally showed a picture of currency contraction, credit stagnation, coupled with traffic obstructions, and commercial exchanges between various places and Shanghai were on the verge of being cut off, and almost all industries were in a state of stagnation. Moreover, due to the blockage of the source of goods, prices soared, especially for necessities such as fuel and food. However, at that time, the government always maintained the foreign exchange price, so consolidating the credit of legal tender was by no means trivial.</p>
<p>3. Evolution of the Wartime Financial Market</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, various financial conditions in Shanghai have largely changed with the environment, and they are all interconnected, or mutually cause and effect. It is not easy to analyze them. For the sake of convenience, the important evolutions of the financial market in the past year are described separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Interbank Remittance and Discounted Cash Before the war, the payment tools of Shanghai banks and native banks, in addition to legal tender cash, included two types of notes: one was the head note, which could be cashed on the same day and was no different from cash; the other was the remittance note, which could only be cashed the next day. The measures for stabilizing finance stipulated that current deposits of more than 300 yuan stored before the war, withdrawals were limited to 5% of the deposit balance per week, and could not exceed 150 yuan at most. At the same time, the Shanghai banks and native banks presented to the Ministry of Finance for approval: "In addition to paying legal tender in accordance with the regulations, each bank's current deposits, in business dealings, due to commercial needs, may be paid with interbank remittance notes outside the limits set by the Ministry." This type of interbank remittance note is allowed to be transferred between Shanghai banks, not paid in legal tender, and may not be used to purchase foreign exchange. It is completely different from the pre-war remittance notes that could be cashed the next day. Its purpose is to facilitate the circulation of industrial and commercial funds, while avoiding the escape of funds. During the January 28th Shanghai War, the promissory notes issued by Shanghai native banks were also temporarily suspended from being cashed the next day, only allowing interbank remittance, which was very similar to this situation. Shanghai industrial and commercial transactions are usually paid by transfer, and payments in legal tender are few. After the war, remittance notes were only allowed to be transferred between banks and could not be paid in cash, which had little impact on commercial needs. However, some foreign banks in Shanghai, because they have no dealings with Chinese banks and native banks, sometimes do not want to accept this type of note; and general import merchants, because they cannot purchase foreign exchange, gradually become discriminatory, and there are even those who lack legal tender funds. In order to facilitate use, they are often willing to exchange 100 yuan of remittance notes for 98 or 99 yuan of cash, thus starting the practice of discounted cash. General speculative merchants saw that there was profit to be made, and competed to make a living by exchanging cash; thus, remittance notes became the object of buying and selling. Initially, the discount for each thousand yuan was about 45 yuan to 120 yuan. Later, the circulation of remittance notes in the market became more and more, and the number of people exchanging cash also increased; in addition, the population of the concession increased sharply, and legal tender cash was required for living needs. Also, due to the active trading of the black market after the foreign exchange control, the discount rate continued to increase. By June of last year, the discount for each thousand yuan once reached more than 70 yuan. After the Banking Association's United Reserve Association came out to maintain it and made large-scale adjustments, the discount was stabilized at around 50 yuan. In November of last year, Guangzhou and Wuhan fell successively, and people were uneasy. Many people exchanged remittance notes for cash to purchase foreign exchange or cash, and the discount rate once again rose to more than 60 yuan. Soon, the war situation stabilized, and it returned to about 45 yuan. In January of this year, after the Banking Association's United Reserve Association officially managed it by announcing the buying and selling prices every day, the discount rate has stabilized at about 35 yuan per thousand yuan, with only a few cents of increase or decrease each day. In early March of this year, due to the impact of the foreign exchange and cash market situation, and at the same time, there was a saying in North China that the currency system was disturbed, the discount rate announced by the Reserve Association was raised to 40 yuan per thousand yuan, and soon rose to 50 yuan. At present, the market discount rate is still around 48 yuan.</p>
<p>2. Interbank Lending and Interest Rates After the currency system reform in 1935, the government originally planned to reorganize the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank. The preparations were not mature, and the Shanghai War had already started. In addition to restricting withdrawals, the Ministry of Finance ordered the four government banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) to organize joint offices and joint lending associations in major cities to unify authority and jointly assume the responsibility of regulating finance. The Shanghai Four Banks Lending Association specializes in interbank mortgage loans and discounting of commercial paper, mainly for discounting head notes. The interbank lending of remittance notes is entrusted by the Four Banks Lending Association to the Banking Association's United Reserve Association to handle it together with the original interbank lending. As of the end of September of the year before last, the loans of the Lending Association totaled more than 18 million yuan, and the interbank remittance loans released by the Banking Association's United Reserve Association also reached about 10 million yuan. After the war, banks and native banks were in great need of funds to prepare for withdrawals. With this assistance, they were able to cope with it easily. According to the statistics at the end of June last year, the total amount of loans released by the Four Banks Lending Association in various places totaled more than 50 million yuan. As of the end of last year, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of loans released by the Four Banks totaled 89 million yuan, of which about 16 million yuan were released in Shanghai, accounting for about 20% of the total, a decrease of 2 million yuan compared with September of the year before last. The amount of interbank remittance lending of the Shanghai Banking Association's United Reserve Association was more than 5 million yuan by the end of last year, a decrease of about 5 million yuan compared with September of the year before last.</p>
<p>There are two types of interbank lending rates in the Shanghai financial market: one is the interbank lending rate of the Bankers Association, which is the interest rate for interbank lending between native banks; the other is the interbank lending rate and discount rate of the Banking Association's United Reserve Association, which is the interest rate for interbank lending and discounting between banks. Since the establishment of the Four Banks Lending Association, it also announces the interbank lending rate and discount rate every day, and there are three different interest rates in the Shanghai financial market.</p>
<p>The interbank lending rate of the Bankers Association was 11% per thousand yuan per day in June and July of the year before last. In early August, due to the tightening of the Shanghai situation, it increased daily, reaching 19% on the 13th. After the opening of banks and native banks on the 17th, it stabilized at 20%. In November and December, it dropped to 15%, and in January of last year, it dropped to 10%, and there was no major fluctuation after that. It once rose to 14% in October, and then returned to the level, hovering around 12%.</p>
<p>The interbank lending rate and discount rate of the Banking Association's United Reserve Association are divided into remittance and national currency. In July of the year before last, the remittance and national currency lending rates were both 11% per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate was 12%. After the Shanghai Battle broke out on August 13th, the national currency lending rate and discount rate were as high as 30%, and the remittance also reached 20%. In October and November, the remittance lending rate and discount rate dropped to 18%, and in December, it rose to 20%. In early August of last year, the lending rate and discount rate of the national currency fell to 25%, and there has been no change since then.</p>
<p>The discount rate opened by the Lending Association in August of the year before last was 8% per week, and the loan interest rate was 30% per thousand yuan per day. From August of last year, the discount rate was changed to 7.5% per week, and the loan interest rate was changed to 25% per thousand yuan per day, which is equal to the interest rate opened by the Banking Association's United Reserve Association.</p>
<p>From the changes in the interbank lending rates of banks and native banks, it can be seen that the financial situation in Shanghai has gradually eased from tension. However, the above-mentioned interbank lending rate of native banks seems to be lower than the interbank lending rate of banks after the war, and the difference is nearly half. The reason for this is that remittance is originally the accounting standard of native banks, and all the head funds of banks have always been concentrated in native banks. The interest rate for interbank deposits is calculated according to the interbank lending rate. If the interbank lending rate increases, the remittance deposit interest rate of native banks for interbank deposits must also increase accordingly, which is tantamount to increasing the burden on native banks. Moreover, after the war, remittance notes cannot be paid in cash, and the remittance funds of native banks are more abundant than before, and they are even more unwilling to raise the interbank lending rate to add to the burden. In fact, the external lending interest rate of native banks is about 8% per month according to the on-site trading plus the average monthly interbank lending rate (for example, the monthly difference between the interbank lending rate of native banks in February this year is 3 yuan plus the on-site trading of 4.5 yuan is 7.5 yuan, that is, the monthly interest rate is 7.5%), which is not much different from the bank lending rate.</p>
<p>(3) Issuance of Legal Tender Since the currency system reform, the right to issue currency throughout the country belongs exclusively to the four banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China), and the issuance reserves of each bank are also concentrated under unified management. After this unprecedented reform, the financial foundation became more sound, so after the outbreak of the war the year before last, although people were extremely panicked, there was no problem with the currency.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, some people, in view of the past events of the European War, were quite concerned about currency inflation. However, judging from the figures in the inspection reports of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee after the war, although the total amount of issuance has increased, it does not seem to have currency inflation compared with before and after the war. According to the inspection report of the committee, the total amount of issuance at the end of 1937 was 1,639,098,000 yuan, which increased to 1,726,998,000 yuan at the end of June 1938. The increase rate was actually not as fast as in the initial stage of the reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the amount of legal tender issuance increased by 56.8 million yuan. From December 1936 to December 1937, it increased by 37.9 million yuan, while in the first half of 1938, it only increased by more than 8.7 million yuan. The committee has not officially announced the issuance figures after June 1938, and there is no way to count them at present.</p>
<p>As for the amount of legal tender in circulation in Shanghai and the speed of its circulation, there is no significant increase in general observation. After the restriction of withdrawals, a part of the loan became a blocked account. In addition, with the stagnation of industry and commerce, the speed of currency circulation was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign Exchange Control and Foreign Exchange Black Market Before the currency system reform, the foreign exchange price in China was allowed to rise and fall naturally. After the currency system reform, the foreign exchange price was centrally managed by the state banks, and the foreign exchange price became stable. At the beginning of the war, domestic funds once fled. At that time, commentators believed that the control of foreign exchange was a necessary measure during the war. However, the government authorities, with the special situation in China, did not act rashly. Until early March of last year, the so-called "United Reserve Bank" was established in North China to issue inconvertible banknotes in an attempt to exchange legal tender and obtain foreign exchange. In order to prevent this, the government had to announce the foreign exchange application rules on March 14th of last year, stipulating that banks could apply to the Central Bank to purchase foreign exchange when they needed foreign exchange for legitimate purposes after offsetting the receipts and payments. After the Central Bank approved it, it sold the foreign exchange at the statutory exchange rate. Imports of goods without legitimate purposes or unnecessary imports were not allowed to apply for purchase. In June of last year, it successively stipulated the types of imported goods to be restricted, and stipulated that each bank should provide the same amount of legal tender cash when applying for foreign exchange to prevent the abuse of deliberately exceeding the amount applied for. At the same time, in order to increase foreign exchange funds, the foreign exchange of export trade was also centrally managed by the state banks. All foreign exchange prices obtained by merchants for exporting goods should also be sold to the state banks. From August 8th of last year, it was also stipulated that the Central Bank would no longer accept applications for foreign exchange for imported goods imported after January 1st of last year. However, imports of necessities were still supplied as appropriate. At this point, foreign exchange control became more stringent.</p>
<p>Before the foreign exchange control, the Shanghai foreign exchange market generally followed the exchange rate announced by the Central Bank as the standard. All foreign commercial banks also abided by the gentleman's agreement and followed the Central Bank's listing. After the implementation of the control, this gentleman's agreement was virtually cancelled. At the same time, general import merchants had to buy at a high price outside the Central Bank because they could not purchase the full amount of foreign exchange from the Central Bank to meet their needs. In addition, those in the concession who are good at worrying about their personal property as a kind of insurance have purchased foreign exchange. Therefore, although the Central Bank still provides the approved foreign exchange at the original exchange rate, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai has been far more expensive than the statutory exchange rate.</p>
<p>The existence of the foreign exchange black market has an adverse impact on Shanghai's trade and finance. The remedy depends on the cooperation of foreign commercial banks and friendly countries. Recently, a new loan of 10 million pounds from China and Britain has been established and designated for balancing legal tender foreign exchange. Therefore, the international conditions for stabilizing China's foreign exchange have been ensured. In the future, we only hope that the people of the country will practice thrift, purchase fewer imported goods, and not seek private interests or speculate, so that the outflow of foreign exchange will not increase, and the black market will not only gradually stabilize, but it will not be difficult to achieve the goal of fundamental elimination.</p>
<p>(5) Over-the-Counter Trading of Public Debt The public debt market also occupies an important position in Shanghai's financial institutions. Banks and native banks not only regard public debt trading as a reliable investment, but also use it as a method of regulating funds. When there is a lot of idle capital, they purchase and store public debt. When there is a shortage of funds, they sell it. The market has the nature of a second business reserve. In the past, there were more than 30 kinds of domestic public debt. After the consolidation in 1936, it has been merged into a unified public debt with an annual interest rate of 6%, which is issued in five types: A, B, C, D, and E. In order to balance the national treasury revenue and expenditure and revive the economy, a revival public debt has been issued. This public debt has no trading in the market. After this consolidation, the financial foundation became more sound, the creditworthiness turned stable, and the price gradually increased. In June 1937, the market price of each debt reached about 89 yuan at the highest. After the outbreak of the war, the situation changed suddenly.</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident broke out in early July of the year before last, the Shanghai public debt market showed a sharp downward trend. It was common for the exchange to suspend trading several times a day. Finally, the Ministry of Finance restricted the minimum price of unified public debt to 70 yuan to stabilize the situation. After the Shanghai Battle broke out, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange suspended business, but over-the-counter trading was still active. The daily trading volume increased from 120,000 to 200,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Later, it gradually became a semi-open market. Initially, the over-the-counter market price was around 40 yuan. At the end of January of last year, in order to avoid the escape of funds, the government changed the repayment of principal and interest of the unified public debt to interbank remittance funds. The over-the-counter market price fell below 40 yuan. The lowest price in February reached a new record of 37 yuan. From March to June, the lowest price was 40 yuan and the highest was 60 yuan. By the time the principal and interest of the public debt due at the end of July were still paid by the government in legal tender, the over-the-counter market price stabilized at around 545 yuan. At the end of September, the European situation was tense, and securities prices fell all over the world. Shanghai was also unable to avoid this. The price of each debt fluctuated by several cents every day. After the peace news came out, it returned to the old level. Later, because the foreign exchange market was stable and there was no profit to be made from buying foreign exchange, some idle capital tended to go to the public debt market. The market price of each debt rose uniformly. In January of this year, the unified Class A public debt reached a high price of 63 yuan. However, at the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced that because China had lost a large amount of tariff revenue, the amount of debts guaranteed by tariffs paid by the government had accumulated to a huge amount of 17.5 million yuan. Therefore, it specifically announced that it would no longer pay for pre-war long-term debts in the future. The news came and caused a great uproar in the public debt market. The price of most of the debts fell by more than 6 yuan in one day. Later, the government announced that the principal and interest of the domestic debt due at the end of January would still be paid in legal tender, but the payment would be made in Chongqing. The Shanghai side could collect it in six installments from the three banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China), which would be paid in full within six months. Thus, people's minds were slightly settled, and the debt market recovered. Recently, a new loan from China and Britain has been established, and the market situation has become more active. At present, the highest market price of each debt is around 56 yuan, and the lowest is around 48 yuan. Compared with the market price before the war, it has fallen by about 30 yuan. The market price of the national salvation public debt issued after the war has always been around 36 yuan, and there has been no change so far.</p>
<p>(6) Revival of the Cash Market The Shanghai Gold Market was originally a place for speculators to operate. In the past, the number of transactions per month often reached 34 million bars. After the currency system reform, it became deserted. The number of transactions per month was only 45,000 bars. After the Shanghai Battle broke out, it completely stopped. China's currency system was originally based on silver. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, it has become a managed currency. The foreign exchange price has long lost its connection with the changes in world gold and silver prices. Since the government implemented foreign exchange control in March of last year, speculators have once again used the changes in the world gold and silver ratio to manipulate it. As a result, the cash transactions in the Shanghai non-public market suddenly became active. After May of last year, the Shanghai cash price was affected by the London market, and the price rose. In mid-June, it rose to 2,000 yuan (the standard gold price of ten taels). It once softened and then rose again, reaching 2,068 yuan in November. In early March of this year, due to the lack of cash chips and the purchase in North China, it once created a high price of 1,200 yuan. At present, it is still hovering around 2,100 yuan. Although the cash market can affect the movement of a part of the funds, because the foreign exchange foundation of China has been stabilized, and the Sino-US Silver Agreement has also been extended last year, it does not seem to have any impact on the entire finance.</p>
<p>(7) Changes in Note Exchange Shanghai's note exchange is divided into three groups: Chinese banks, native banks, and foreign banks. The note exchange of Chinese banks was established in January 1933 and is hosted by the Banking Association's United Reserve Association. Its exchange procedures are similar to those in European and American countries. Native banks also have the organization of remittance headquarters, but their exchange methods are very old. As for the note collection and settlement between the Bund banks (including foreign banks and the three banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China)), there is only a reconciliation method, and there is no organization and system of the clearing house.</p>
<p>Before the war, the bank note exchange was held twice a day at 1:00 pm and 3:30 pm. After the war, due to the reduction in notes, it was changed to once a day at 3:00 pm. From January to July 1937, the average daily transaction volume of the exchange was more than 29 million yuan. From August to December, the daily average was only 7 million yuan, which was about 4 to 1. From January to July 1938, the daily average was only more than 6 million yuan. From August to December, it improved slightly, and the daily average was about 9 million yuan. Among the exchange amounts in various months after the war, December 1937 and December 1938 were the lowest, with a daily average of only 3.6 million yuan. However, the exchange amount has gradually increased recently. In January of this year, the daily average exchange amount has reached more than 24 million yuan, which is close to the daily average amount before the war, indicating that commercial transactions in Shanghai have gradually become more active under special circumstances.</p>
<p>The note exchange of native banks is called reconciliation of public orders. The daily number of public order settlements includes the number of interbank lending transfers, which is different in nature from the note exchange figures of banks and is difficult to compare. However, in general observation, the trend of the number of public order receipts and settlements of native banks is the same as the rise and fall of the number of bank note exchanges. As for the note receipt and settlement method of the native bank industry, it has been slightly improved after the war. In the past, each bank sent old clerks to collect the notes separately. Now, each bank sends two exchange staff members to the headquarters for centralized processing from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm every day. In addition, the public orders for reconciliation of accounts among native banks have always stipulated that large public orders should be issued for those who are full of 500 yuan, and small public orders should be issued for those who are less than 500 yuan and zero numbers. They should be settled with the native bank reserve every day. In November of last year, the native bank association decided to cancel the names of large and small orders. No matter how large or small the number is, one public order should be issued and settled every day, which has simplified the procedures.</p>
<p>As for the note receipt and settlement procedures of the Bund banks, after sending and verifying the notes to each other, large transfer slips are used to make a general transfer by the Bank of China. After the difference is settled with each other every day, the method of deposit or cash settlement is used, and there is no organization of the clearing house at first. Since the outbreak of the war, the large transfer slip method adopted in the past has been abandoned, and each bank sends staff members to the HSBC Bank at 11:30 am every day to centrally verify it. In addition, foreign commercial banks have never had deposit and debt dealings with Chinese banks. After the war, for the convenience of collection and settlement, foreign commercial banks have set up current accounts with our Central Bank as an exception, and the Central Bank has also opened current accounts with foreign commercial banks. Therefore, the notes receivable and payable daily between Chinese and foreign banks are entrusted to each other for collection and transferred within the current accounts, which is much more convenient than before.</p>
<p>(8) Status of the Financial Industry Since the outbreak of the war, the environment in which the Shanghai financial industry is located has been very different. Leaving aside foreign commercial banks for the time being, as far as Chinese banks and native banks are concerned, since the Lugouqiao Incident in July of the year before last, there has been a trend of withdrawals. In the month before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the deposits of various banks and native banks clearly decreased. After the Shanghai War broke out, banks and native banks suspended business for four days. After the government issued measures to stabilize finance, people's minds were slightly settled, and there was no large-scale decline in deposits. Later, as the war zone expanded, the rich from various places flocked to Shanghai to take refuge with their assets. As a result, the deposits of various banks and native banks gradually increased. However, most of these increased deposits were current deposits. On the part of banks and native banks, they could not but accumulate reserves to cope with them.</p>
<p>After the war, the business policy of each bank and native bank strived for stability, and they were very cautious about various loans. Most of them reduced the scope of business and only accepted deposits but did not release them. Fortunately, some of the pawnbrokers of the banks and native banks who suffered losses in the war have recently made profits from the high prices in Shanghai, in addition to making up for the war losses. Therefore, the pre-war loans of the banks and native banks, except for the customers who suspended business during the war, can often be recovered as scheduled. In addition, the business of each bank, in addition to some loans, foreign exchange and other businesses, was inevitably stagnant after the war, while other businesses such as custody warehouses, real estate trusts, etc., have increased compared with before the war. This kind of abnormal development is the only phenomenon under the special environment in Shanghai at present, and it goes without saying that it cannot last long.</p>
<p>In the war period, the losses on the assets of banks and native banks were inevitable. Fortunately, most of the banks and native banks were generally operating steadily and were well prepared in peacetime, and the previous profits were more than enough to offset the current losses. Only a very small number of banks with a smaller scope suffered from the war and were said to have had difficulties in turnover. As for those who went bankrupt as a result, there was only one bank. At the same time, among the four banks that suspended business one month before the outbreak of the war, two have resumed business one after another last year.</p>
<p>The four banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) are the largest government banks in the country and have outstanding influence in the financial world. Their headquarters were originally located in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, these four government banks have moved their headquarters to the inland and set up institutions in various provinces in the southwest and Hong Kong. Shanghai's financial power has tended to be dispersed. At present, the ways and objects of each bank in Shanghai using funds in peacetime have all felt congested and reduced after the war. Moreover, because the government actively promotes and encourages investment in the development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce in the inland, the general commercial banks in Shanghai have tended to develop in the inland. Recently, there have been many banks that have established branches in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The financial center has tended to shift, and the future development is worthy of attention.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Significance of Anglo-Soviet Military Cooperation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>According to a reliable Rome dispatch carried in today's Hong Kong-based "China Mail," "The Soviet Union has suggested to the British that, in the event of war, the British are free to use Vladivostok and Kamchatka." The stated purpose of this cooperation is to jointly confront Japan. The Soviet Union's condition for allowing British and Soviet use of these two locations is that Britain supplies the Soviet Union with military supplies via Canada. If this is the case, then Britain will use Vladivostok as a base and Kamchatka as a base for the Canadian Air Force. Britain not only possesses the Singapore naval base on the ocean, sufficient to resist Japanese naval aggression and strike at Japanese power in the Pacific, but it can also cut off the Japanese army's communication in the Sea of Japan and threaten the Japanese islands with air power. If this cooperation is indeed realized, then even if the bellicose Japanese warlords do not yield to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they will inevitably face complete failure.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism not only relies on the security of the Sea of Japan to conduct its continental aggression, but it also depends on this route of communication to secure the results of its aggression. Before the "September 18th Incident" (Mukden Incident), Japan almost completely neglected the development of its Sea of Japan coastline, the so-called "Inner Japan." The achievements of several decades of development since the Meiji Restoration were entirely concentrated on the Pacific coast, the so-called "Outer Japan." Even its railways developed in a north-south direction, with very few east-west lines. However, since the "September 18th Incident," Japanese aggressors have keenly realized that to safeguard their spoils on the continent, they must fully expand the communication lines between the Japanese islands and the mainland, and shorten these communication lines and time as much as possible. Therefore, they adopted a three-pronged approach: first, building new ports in northern Korea, namely Chongjin, Unggi, and Najin; second, actively developing various ports on the west coast of the Sea of Japan, such as Tsuruga and Maizuru; and third, accelerating the construction of railway networks in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. As a result, the communication lines between mainland Japan and the continent have been greatly shortened. For example, the route from Changchun to Tsuruga via Chongjin is more than 750 kilometers shorter than the route via Dalian. Transporting goods from Changchun to Osaka via the Changtu line through Chongjin takes 17 hours less than going via Dalian, and passenger transport takes 21 hours less.</p>
<p>The construction of the three ports in northern Korea not only economically deprived Vladivostok of its position as a transportation hub, but also has extremely important political and military significance. Although the Japanese army claims to want to achieve self-sufficiency on the mainland through "local sourcing," this hope remains empty in the near future because most of the Japanese army's food still needs to be supplied from mainland Japan. The production of military supplies in "Manchuria" cannot supply much of the necessary materials; at best, it can only provide basic raw materials, which still need to be processed by Japanese mainland arsenals to become finished products. Politically, if this line of communication is cut off, not only will there be complete panic in "Manchuria," but there is also the possibility of major chaos in Korea. According to a report by the U.S. Foreign Policy Association, the Eighth Route Army, which infiltrated the Northeast last year, is very active, posing an even greater threat.</p>
<p>It is very clever of Britain to focus on this Japanese throat. If it can genuinely cooperate with the United States and the Soviet Union, then restraining the Japanese warlords is extremely easy. If the British and Soviet air forces can exert their maximum power, then the Japanese islands will immediately become scorched earth. The ease with which Japanese city facilities and house construction can be destroyed, and the fact that the entire archipelago can be turned into ruins in a short period of time, need not be mentioned. The fact that its industries and businesses, as a result of capitalist development, are concentrated in a few major cities, such as the Tokyo-Yokohama area, the Osaka-Kobe area, and northern Kyushu, is the most vulnerable point of Japan. If Japan's enemies can attack this weakness, the destruction of the Japanese empire will come easily. Japan is also aware of the danger of having its Sea of Japan communication lines cut off, so the military is planning to build an undersea passage to prepare for any eventuality. However, an undersea transportation route cannot be completed in a year or two. If Japan's enemies can take advantage of the period before its completion to inflict a major blow, then eliminating a global aggressor and safeguarding genuine peace in the Far East can be easily achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Battle in Northern Jiangxi Enters a New Stage: Our Forces in Nanchang Shift to Favorable Positions; Increased Soldiers in Northern Hunan Attempt to Invade Southward <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] The great battle in northern Jiangxi is still fierce. Due to our fierce counterattacks, [the enemy] has suffered a great blow. All [enemy troops] are now under our complete encirclement and control. Fierce battles are raging for the high ground near Anyi County, including Wangjiaqiao, Changshan, Wangshi Temple, and Taishan. Intense fighting is also taking place near Wanjiabu, including Tangkou, Tujiapu, Hucun, Wanshou Town, and Jiukou. [The enemy], invading from southeast of Fengxin, is still being blocked by us in the Wanshou Palace, Miaoshan, and Zhaoshan area of Xinjian County. South of Ruoxi, our [forces] are fighting fiercely north of Huajiashan, Nanshan, and Wufengshan. Intense fighting is also taking place northeast of Wuning, including Guanzhengshan, Shitishan, and east of Zilishanshan. Statistics show that enemy casualties have reached 7,000 to 8,000 in the past week, and we have also suffered considerable casualties. One of our units in the Fengxin-Anyi area has launched a flank attack on [the enemy], [capturing] quite a few [enemy soldiers]. It is reported that one of our strike teams has advanced to the vicinity of Ruichang.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th] Military officials of the Chinese government here stated that the Japanese report of capturing Nanchang yesterday has not yet been confirmed, or it may still be in the hands of the Chinese army, which is not yet known. Neutral observers believe that the Japanese army has not yet completely occupied Nanchang, because the Japanese army usually occupies a station or a corner of the city and claims to have occupied the entire city. Chinese military officials admit that there is indeed fierce fighting near Nanchang, and the Chinese army is currently counterattacking Anyi.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, 27th] Unconfirmed foreign news: After the battle on the Nanxun line intensified, [the enemy] who broke through our positions between Qiujin and Yongxiu advanced along the highway to Anyi and then divided into three routes. One route advanced on Nanchang from Wanjiabu, one route attacked Jing'an to the west as cover, and one route advanced along the highway on Gao'an, attempting to cut off the Xiang-Gan Railway in the Jinjiang area and outflank Nanchang from the rear. For strategic reasons, starting on the 26th, we destroyed all buildings that could be used by the enemy, such as the Zhongzheng Bridge and the airport on the Gan River, preparing to abandon Nanchang. After we withdrew, [the enemy] advanced from the highway to the opposite bank of the Gan River, looting civilian boats to cross the river. Their engineers are repairing a temporary bridge on the ruins of the Zhongzheng Bridge. Currently, we are entering favorable positions. The 1.2 million population of Gan [Nanchang], has been repeatedly evacuated, and before the abandonment, there were fewer than 10,000 people left. Moreover, it has been repeatedly bombed, and the city is in terrible condition. Economically and strategically, it has lost its importance. [The enemy]'s invasion this time was carried out without regard for casualties, fighting to the death with us, so the losses were the greatest since the second stage of the war of resistance. Obtaining an empty city is actually not worth the loss.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th] According to well-informed sources, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has recently moved from Nanchang to Ji'an, 130 miles to the south.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th Noon] Local newspapers reported that the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking Nanchang for the past week, with two purposes: (1) to cut off the railway connection between Zhejiang and Hunan, in other words, to cut off the connection between the Chinese army in southern Zhejiang and Shanghai and the central government; (2) to use Nanchang as a base to invade Changsha and attempt to occupy the entire Yuehan Railway line.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 27th] According to local Chinese newspaper opinions, the Japanese army's fierce attack on Nanchang this time is the most intense battle since the fall of Hankou. Its purpose is to open up the Yuehan Railway line, cut off the route from Zhejiang to the interior, and consolidate the Japanese army's occupied areas' transportation lines. Before this goal is achieved, the Japanese army only has the Yangtze River as a transportation route. Some people believe that if China can launch a large army to counterattack Jiujiang or Pukou to cut off the Japanese army's rear supply line, then the Japanese in Hubei will become turtles in a jar.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Linchuan, 26th] On the 24th, the enemy on the Nanxun [Nanchang-Jiujiang] line fiercely attacked Malukou (about 50 miles northwest of Nanchang) and engaged in fierce fighting with our troops. The main force of the enemy arrived in Anyi on the 24th and is now leading about 300 to 400 new [enemy] soldiers and four tanks, with no unusual movements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 26th] The enemy advancing east along the Xiang-Gan Highway has used a large amount of poison gas against our defending troops, and most of our soldiers have been poisoned. This afternoon, [the enemy] took the opportunity to invade Wushiqiao and continued to charge fiercely with tanks, advancing to the Niuxing Railway Station at one point. Our army bravely fought back and repelled [the enemy]. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Wushiqiao area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 27th] At 9:00 PM on the 25th, Captain Uryu Takeo, commander of the [Japanese] squadron, and Lieutenant Suimoto Takao, squadron officer, were killed by us in Chenzhuang, northeast of Wuxue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 27th] Our troops counterattacking Anyi are making smooth progress. On the 26th, they occupied the [enemy] strongholds of Fenghuangshan (4 kilometers east of Anyi), Hushan (19 kilometers southeast of Anyi), and Chenjia [unclear] (13 kilometers southeast of Anyi) and are advancing on the Xianxi-Anyi line and the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiping, 27th] In the morning of the 26th, we launched a large-scale attack on the [enemy] in [unclear] Mountain (southeast of Guichi). We encountered [the enemy] near Panhong Village (south of Qishan) and Xucun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 27th] About two [Japanese] regiments have arrived in Yangloudong and Yanglousi in the past two days, on the 20th about 1,000 [Japanese soldiers] arrived in Minbanpu, 500-600 in Huaqiao, and [Japanese] soldiers have also increased in Tongcheng, with intentions to attack us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, [unclear], 27th] In the first half of this month, our army divided its forces to attack various [enemy] strongholds in Zhongtiao Mountain. We engaged in fierce fighting with about 1,000 [enemy] soldiers from the Taniguchi Regiment in [unclear], Xijiaokou, and Hejiacheng, killing and wounding over 200 [enemy] soldiers, including two officers. Our army, in the Jinshezhen area north of Zhongyang City, double-crossed the Kanamori Regiment, killing and wounding a total of 113 [enemy] soldiers below the platoon leader of the Yada Detachment.

<h3 id="e19">The Rapidly Growing China Industrial Cooperative Association: Mr. Alley Reports on his Northwest Inspection at a Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists in Chongqing <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing Correspondence] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, we have lost cities with dense industrial areas. The workers in these cities and the machinery in the factories did not fall into the hands of the enemy. The workers would rather scatter in all directions, offering up their last bit of strength and their only iron nail to their beloved motherland, hoping to achieve final victory. This is the origin of the China Industrial Cooperative Association and the focus of its work.</p>
<p>To help everyone understand the development of its work, the China Industrial Cooperative Association hosted more than forty Chinese and foreign journalists in Chongqing. Mr. Liu Guangpei delivered the opening remarks, explaining the significance of this reception. Then, Mr. Alley, the initial initiator of the association, was invited to report on his inspection of various industrial cooperatives in the Northwest.</p>
<p>Mr. Alley, an American, with the simplicity of the Soviet people, stood up and said sincerely:</p>
<p>"I never thought we could have any success before, but after returning from my inspection of various places in the Northwest, I was surprised by the rapid development of the China Industrial Cooperative Association. Chinese workers have a very strong cooperative spirit. Although they have little education, they can produce various items for the front and the rear after a short period of training. Because these cooperatives are small in scale, the relationship between the workers and the cooperative is very close. The workers regard the cooperative as their own home, so they always try to save on the cooperative's expenses. Workers can find ways to buy machines with an original value of 1,600 yuan for half the price.</p>
<p>"When the workers in Hankou were evacuated last year, Madame Chiang sent a group of female workers to the Northwest. These female workers worked in the mountains or in earthen kilns. The environment is obviously much more difficult than before, but if someone were to ask them if they would like to return to their original places, they would definitely answer no, because they now have their own organizations and their own chairpersons. In their work, they can also work for their own benefit and the benefit of the entire nation. They bring their babies with them, and their parents and husbands are also by their side. These husbands used to spend all day chatting in tea houses, doing nothing, and relying solely on their wives to make a living, but now they also have an interest in working."</p>
<p>Everyone was excited to hear this news.</p>
<p>"The workers in the cooperative have a very strong organizational ability," Mr. Alley continued. "There are already joint cooperative organizations in the Northwest, as well as cooperative hostels, which are set up to solve the difficulties that workers encounter in their lives and when traveling and shopping. These hostels are cheap and clean, and other places can follow suit.</p>
<p>"The products of the cooperative mostly use waste materials and local products as raw materials. For example, dry batteries are mostly made by collecting and改造廢電池来加以改造廢電池來加以改造 old batteries. Military uniforms and blankets are made from the unique products of the Northwest. In the past, these wools were transported to Japan by the truckload, and Japanese goods were exchanged for them. Now, the wool cooperatives make products to supply the front lines.</p>
<p>"The Northwest has plenty of raw materials!" he lamented. "Everywhere there is soda, crystal salt, sugarcane... If these raw materials are manufactured, they will become indispensable items for the front and rear of China.</p>
<p>"Now more than half of the enthusiastic young people in China have gone to the front lines. In fact, the economic war in the rear is as important as the gun war on the front lines. Our Industrial Cooperative Association is the hub for promoting the work of all industrial cooperatives. We have already established six or seven hundred cooperatives, and there is an urgent need for young people with expertise in industry, so we hope that everyone will actively participate."</p>
<p>After this report was completed, everyone was very interested, especially the foreign journalists. They asked questions about what they did not understand, and Mr. Alley answered them one by one:</p>
<p>Q: Can industrial cooperatives succeed?</p>
<p>A: From the time of their establishment to now, none have failed in their operations.</p>
<p>Q: How many industrial cooperatives do you plan to set up? How much funding do you need?</p>
<p>A: We plan to set up three thousand from the Northwest to the Southeast, and the funding only needs one percent of the US$35 million in American defense funds.</p>
<p>Q: How many people are now living on these cooperatives?</p>
<p>A: Six thousand people, plus their families.</p>
<p>Q: How many types are there in total?</p>
<p>A: Fifty.</p>
<p>Q: Are they all different from ordinary consumer cooperatives?</p>
<p>A: Completely different.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of people do you hope will come to work?</p>
<p>A: People who can endure hardship and bravely shoulder the responsibility of resisting Japan and building the country! (Zhi Chao)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Mussolini's Speech Expresses Demands on France, Affirms Close Relations Between Germany and Italy, and States Unwillingness for Unlimited Military Expansion <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 26th] Mussolini's speech at the Fascist 20th anniversary celebration in the stadium here was greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, so that some parts of his speech were drowned out by the cheers. He said, "This celebration is held at a time of serious European situation. Our actions will not be diverted by the fear of war. The word peace is now as prevalent as counterfeit money, but we have been working for a long period of peace for the construction of Europe. Various attempts from the outside to overthrow the Berlin-Rome axis are naive and ridiculous. The Berlin-Rome axis is not only a relationship between the two countries, but also a relationship between two revolutions, and modern civilization arises from these two revolutions. We will do our best to deal with the anti-totalitarian front. The events in Central Europe have become a predetermined fate. When I spoke in Genoa, I mentioned the differences between Italy and France" (at this time, the audience expressed contempt for France). "In a few days or a few hours, the Spanish National Army will launch its final attack, and Madrid will become the tomb of communism. The problem of Italian colonies was raised to France on December 17th of last year (when Italian congressmen shouted about colonies), mentioning Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez. Geographically, politically, and militarily, the Mediterranean is Italian, so we must implement armament. Today's so-called order is to build more cannons, battleships, and airplanes regardless of the cost. Our path has already been chosen, and our doctrine is very clear. Our revolution is not yet complete. If we speak of social customs and ethics, the revolution has hardly begun. How successful has our past twenty years of efforts for fascism been? Let others settle it. However, we can say with certainty that our achievements are very significant and will remain for centuries to come. Although we believe that permanent peace is the scourge of civilization, we also believe that a long period of peace is necessary to ensure the development of European civilization. Although others have asked us to find ways to promote peace, we will not engage in promoting peace until our sacred and inviolable rights are respected by other countries. The events in Central Europe were destined to happen. I dare to declare that if the democratic countries see the countries they created with their own hands suddenly die prematurely and weep, we have sufficient reason not to mourn with them. However, morally speaking, there is no reason to attack this issue. History has repeatedly proven that if a nation has sufficient manpower and sufficient military strength but cannot flex its muscles, it means that the nation has become a thing of the past and is no longer capable of fulfilling its new mission." He then mentioned the colonial issue, saying, "These colonial issues include Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. The French government can freely reject these repeatedly raised issues or only talk about them. However, if the gap between the two countries deepens as a result, making it difficult to bridge, then they will no longer have any complaints. If the current situation does not change, we hope not to hear the names of brother countries and sister countries again in the future (France and Italy are both Latin nations, and there is a custom of calling them this). Their relationship is a relationship of strength, and this relationship of strength is the element that determines our policies. Moreover, what we call the Mediterranean includes the Adriatic Sea. Our interests in that area are very important. However, we do not want to exclude the interests of the Slavic nations in that area, so peace has been maintained there for the past two years. The most fundamental luxury is that we must arm ourselves. Today's so-called order is to build more cannons, battleships, and airplanes regardless of the cost, regardless of any method, and even exclude the so-called national life completely. When you are strong, you will be loved by your friends and feared by your enemies. Since the dawn of time, the voice that has been passed down from generation to generation is "Woe to the unarmed." Comrades, the glorious brown clothes on your bodies are embellished with a color as red as blood. When the interests of the country are harmed, we are prepared to shed blood to defend them. Today is a great day for you, motivated by courage, sacrifice, and faith. You have given a major impetus to the wheels of history. I will now ask you, do you hope for glory or for a comfortable life? Do you feel that there is anything impossible? Do you still remember our three major creeds: "Faith, obedience, combat"? That's all. The secret of all victory lies in these three words."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 26th] Political figures here recently declared that Premier Mussolini's speech today could ease the Mediterranean situation. Even if this prospect is very weak, it should not be ignored. A careful reading of the Premier's speech reveals that the most important part is the section on the relationship between France and Italy, which clearly indicates that the Spanish issue is no longer an obstacle to relations between the two countries. The only thing that remains to be resolved is the colonial issue, but the Premier only uses the word "issue" and does not use the word "demand". As for the so-called colonial issue, according to well-informed sources, Italy's minimum wishes are nothing more than the following: (1) The legal status of Italian immigrants in French Tunisia in North Africa should be revised. (2) France should cede the railway line from the port of Djibouti to Addis Ababa to Italy. (3) A part of the French port of Djibouti should be designated as a free port for Italy to use. (4) Reduce the Suez Canal passage fee. (5) Allow Italy to participate in the Suez Canal management rights. It seems that the so-called natural wishes of Italy have now officially targeted Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. Diplomatic sources say that in view of the speeches delivered successively by King Emmanuel III and Premier Mussolini, it is known that Italy is now waiting for France to take the initiative in order to reopen negotiations. As for the reason why the Premier mentioned the Adriatic Sea in his speech, it was probably to indicate that no third country should be allowed to set foot on the Adriatic coast.</p>
<p>The British side attaches importance to it, but believes that it will not have a bad impact.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 27th] Although some parts of the Mussolini's speech were full of warlike rhetoric, British political circles believe that the speech is very hopeful and indicates that the problems between France and Italy can be resolved soon. There has been much criticism here for Mussolini's public demands for Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. (1) Mussolini and French Laval concluded an agreement in 1935, and announced the abolition of this agreement on December 17 of last year, stipulating that the Italian people of Tunisia have special rights. It is heard that France is prepared to recognize Italy's special status in the area, but France, with the support of the United States, will definitely reject any demands that threaten the Bizerta naval base or important African ports belonging to Britain and France. (2) After Italy conquered Abyssinia, Djibouti lost its main value to France, and Italy's demands on Djibouti will be discussed by France and Italy.</p>
<p>[London, 27th] Foreign news Mussolini's speech in Rome last night has been carefully studied here and no public comment has been made. After reading it, authoritative sources here believe that it is not much different from the recent speech by the Italian King, and it does not seem to have any adverse impact on the current chaotic European situation. Mussolini's strong support for the German-Italian axis and his clarification of Italy's urgent needs are considered to be within expectations here and are being closely studied. At the same time, they are very pleased with Mussolini's expression of a desire for Europe to enjoy a long period of peace. It is generally believed that there is still room for negotiation and adjustment between France and Italy. Therefore, in this speech, Mussolini tried his best to avoid radical words, and did not express any intention to refuse Franco-Italian negotiations. Even with regard to the demands he put forward, there was no complexity or expansion. The British have no doubt about the importance of the Mediterranean or the Adriatic Sea to Italy, so there is no need for any concern on the British side regarding the Premier's remarks on this issue. Mussolini's mention of the danger of ideological conflict coincides with Chamberlain's recent statement on Thursday that "Britain does not want to create groups of ideological opposition in Europe".</p>
<p>French political circles express the limits of discussion</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] France believes that the main intention of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech is that Italy has for the first time publicly raised its demands for Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, without mentioning Nice, Savoy, and Corsica. It is heard that France will take this opportunity to reopen negotiations with Italy through diplomatic channels.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet, after carefully studying the French translation of Mussolini's speech, believes that the overall situation has not changed, because Mussolini still insists on making demands on France. Therefore, direct negotiations between France and Italy are impossible. However, Mussolini has not closed the door to negotiations with Britain and France. French officials believe that Mussolini's statement that the Mediterranean has important relations with Italy is denied, but they believe that France also has equally important relations, because its very long coastline is also in the Mediterranean. An official spokesman said that Premier Daladier's policy has not changed slightly, that is, France will never give up an inch of territory. The three issues of Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal raised by Mussolini are actually French issues. If Italy's demands can be abandoned, France is willing to consider negotiations. However, it is hoped that countries related to the Mediterranean and the general situation will jointly establish an agreement to resolve them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech this morning has been commented on by political figures here as follows: Since he did not make an irremediable statement, the difficulties encountered in the relations between France and Italy have not become more serious as a result. The fact that he referred to his speech in the port of Genoa last year shows that the various outstanding issues between France and Italy cannot be resolved before the end of the Spanish Civil War. France's original position has not changed in this regard. In other words, the management rights of the Suez Canal and matters related to the French port of Djibouti in East Africa can be submitted for discussion. However, as far as the status of Italian immigrants in French Tunisia is concerned, France has no reason to accept other methods except in accordance with the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935. In addition, Premier Mussolini pointed out that the problems that Italy should solve in the Mediterranean are not limited to French-Italian cases. He said that Italy should be in a superior position in the Adriatic Sea. Although this statement is euphemistic, it is actually a warning to Germany not to take any action regarding the port of Trieste (which was ceded to Italy by Austria after the European War and has now been opened as a free port). In short, although Premier Mussolini said that the events that occurred in Central Europe a few days ago were inevitable, he did not indicate that this was a victory for the Berlin-Rome axis.</p>
<p>American officials have a good impression</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Officials and financial circles here have a good impression of Mussolini's speech, because some parts of his speech are moderate in tone and indicate that the various outstanding issues between France and Italy can still be resolved through diplomatic channels. Senator Cloutiere Peabody said that the Italian Premier's speech indicates that the current crisis can still be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 27th] The "Tribune" here today wrote an article, warning against those who consider Mussolini's speech to be "moderate", saying: Hitler gave a speech on January 13 that was considered moderate, but then he annexed Czechoslovakia. Mussolini's speech contains positive statements and should not be considered moderate. There is still no real security in Europe, but the current crisis may have been saved.</p>
<p>German spokespersons are still fueling the flames</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] A statement authorized by a newspaper here said, "Italy has now made clear through its government leader the historical demands regarding Tunisia, Djibouti, and Suez, so the possibility of evading a reply will no longer exist."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] It is heard here that Mussolini's speech has been warmly supported and endorsed. A spokesperson said, "Mussolini has clearly stated that peace is not an unconditional reservation of past facts. If the old residence is not allowed to be rebuilt, it is imperative to build a new house. If Britain rashly launches a war, the end result may not be the same as in the past."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 26th] This criticized Mussolini's speech, saying, "The Italian Premier's speech is a response to all attempts to encircle the Axis powers. France must now give a clear answer to Italy's Mediterranean demands."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 26th] According to authoritative sources, Franco's general offensive against Madrid is about to begin,</p>
<p>Adopting a Comprehensive Blockade Plan</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 27th] Franco's headquarters issued a final ultimatum to the people in the government-controlled areas at 2:40 PM yesterday, demanding a cessation of resistance and complete surrender. Franco's side expressed that they would adopt a lenient attitude towards the government forces, and would not punish soldiers or left-wing elements. However, those who continue to resist will be punished in accordance with the law, because they are merely shedding unnecessary blood. If the government forces reject this final ultimatum, Franco will immediately launch a large-scale offensive, for which military preparations have been underway for several weeks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 27th] It is reported that the National Defense Council has accepted Franco's terms, and Madrid will officially and peacefully surrender today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 27th] Franco issued a final ultimatum to the government forces from Burgos radio this morning. The National Defense Council here has ordered a swift surrender because Franco's troops have adopted a comprehensive blockade plan.</p>
<p>Franco Issues Final Ultimatum</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 27th] Franco issued a final ultimatum from Burgos radio, stating in brief: "Spaniards in enemy territory, pay close attention. Victory in Catalonia has long been recognized by your leaders. We are now preparing to fulfill our previous promises. A major offensive is about to begin, and the seaports will all be blockaded. Your resistance is futile and will only increase your burden. If you wish to avoid bloodshed, raise the white flag and surrender quickly. Together, we will build a great and free nation."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Burgos, 27th] The official announcement on the radio here this morning stated, "The time for the liberation of Spanish soil is approaching. Before that time arrives, we warn the enemy that the extremism and liberalism of the past are completely lost. The enemy must also understand that they are fighting for a worthless cause, causing Spain to fall into disaster. The enemy must also understand that only General Franco is the sole leader, and those who disobey will be dealt with according to the law." Reports from Madrid say that Franco's planes flew to the front lines to bomb, and the extent of casualties is unknown. It is also known that the National Defense Council there is quite busy.</p>
<p>Snow and Wind Intermingle; a Miserable Scene</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 27th] The people here originally hoped that peace could be achieved on Monday, but now peace talks have broken down again, and the situation is quite chaotic. Franco's offensive seems imminent, and the people here are extremely panicked. They can now only fill their stomachs with water and bean juice. Furthermore, the wind and snow continue all day, and the accumulated snow is extremely thick, creating a miserable scene.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lisbon, 27th] Madrid radio broadcast news at 3:55 this morning stating that peace has broken down, and the National Defense Council met for a long time and decided to resist to the death.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 27th] Reports that Germany has made demands on Poland have not been confirmed. It is generally believed that Poland's military preparations are due to the belief that Germany will exert pressure to change the status of Danzig. It is heard that Poland has clearly stated its opposition to the "Polish Corridor" issue, while Germany may suggest building a German highway through this corridor.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 27th] Poland is still continuing military preparations, but maintaining extreme secrecy.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in Grimsby yesterday, advocating the swift formation of a coalition cabinet. The foundation for the organization of its members should be expanded as much as possible. The new government has two objectives: (1) to control British industry, wealth, and manpower to strive for expansion in the shortest possible time, and (2) to adopt an active foreign policy, uniting all peace-loving countries to resist new acts of aggression.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e26">On the Loss of Nanchang and the Future War Situation <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>After ten days of intense fighting in northern Jiangxi, our army voluntarily withdrew from Nanchang.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Jiujiang last July, Nanchang has been threatened on three sides and is in imminent danger. It has been able to stubbornly hold out for more than half a year. This must be attributed to the persistent fighting of the soldiers and civilians in northern Jiangxi, southern Anhui, and the border areas of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. Today, under the cruel bombing and large-scale gas attacks by the [Japanese] army for 72 hours, our army was forced to withdraw in good order. From an overall strategic point of view, there is absolutely nothing strange about it.</p>
<p>The [Japanese] army's "Nanchang Offensive" had a comprehensive plan, its purpose being to eliminate our main force around Nanchang and expand the "mopping-up operations" in the southeastern provinces. However, in this Nanchang offensive, it was still forced to fight for cities and transportation lines, and it failed to inflict any damage on our main force. On the contrary, although it forcibly occupied Nanchang, the elite troops it mobilized in central China have been sporadically cut off, resisted, and surrounded by us. It not only failed to complete its planned "Nanchang Offensive" but also plunged the troops in central China into even greater difficulties. Conversely, our army has maintained its full strength, is able to maneuver freely, and can strike at the [Japanese] at any time.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must also clearly recognize that Nanchang is the only important city we have left in Jiangnan. Now that Nanchang has fallen and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been cut off, the connection between the southeastern battlefield and the southwestern base area has suffered even greater difficulties. Conversely, after occupying Nanchang, if the [Japanese] further complete their connection with the Anhui-Jiangxi-Hubei area, they can advance to Changsha to cut off the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway or retreat to consolidate the southeastern occupied area and engage in "mopping-up" operations and preparations for further aggression.</p>
<p>We understand that the loss of Nanchang will not affect the overall war situation, and the [Japanese]'s forcible occupation of Nanchang will inevitably increase their difficulties. We must also guard against new difficulties that may arise after the loss of Nanchang. Therefore, today we must raise our vigilance and implement the necessary countermeasures under the principle of not being discouraged by defeat.</p>
<p>First, the loss of Nanchang proves that although the [Japanese] army's combat effectiveness is gradually declining, it still has the power to continue its offensive. The high degree of exertion of this offensive power can still cause us to lose famous cities and important towns. However, the result of each subsequent high degree of exertion will inevitably lead to a greater decline in its power. This can be understood by observing the time distance from the fall of Xuzhou and Wuhan to the fall of Nanchang. Therefore, our task today must be to strive to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front lines, develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, stop the [Japanese] offensive, and advance the second stage of the War of Resistance, namely the stalemate stage.</p>
<p>Second, based on the first point, we must today oppose muddled and unrealistic optimists. We must raise our vigilance against the [Japanese]'s new offensives and new conspiracies. We demand greater progress in military and political affairs in order to overcome the final difficult situation of defeat and destruction. At the same time, based on the above first point, namely that every high degree of exertion of the [Japanese]'s power will inevitably lead to a more drastic decline, we must work harder to smash all traitorous pro-Japanese elements' defeatist "peace and compromise" arguments and prevent any recurrence of pessimistic and disappointed sentiments. Because the [Japanese] are using the false "victory" they have gained by putting everything on the line to deceive their people and to induce us to surrender, this is something we must guard against even more.</p>
<p>Third, after the [Japanese] forcibly occupy Nanchang, it is certainly a major threat to the New Fourth Army and its allied forces, which are launching a large-scale guerrilla war in the southeastern provinces, and the [Japanese]'s military and political pressure on the southeastern provinces will be even more severe. At the same time, the [Japanese]'s strategy of occupying Changsha in order to open up the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway may be implemented immediately. In order to smash the [Japanese]'s further adventures, we must first reinforce southern Anhui and western Zhejiang with a large number of mobile corps, and penetrate into the various areas behind enemy lines in the border areas of Anhui-Jiangxi and Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi to prevent the [Japanese] army from maneuvering and to disintegrate and strike them. In view of the isolation of the southeast from the west, the anti-Japanese troops and civilians in the southeast should be given the power to establish a general anti-Japanese base area and local anti-Japanese governments, like the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi border area, to give full play to the anti-Japanese forces in the southeast. [The strategy] is still the basic policy of the [Japanese]'s new offensive. Therefore, we must not neglect the [Japanese]'s "northwest and southwest" strategy, especially to strengthen the security of the southwest!</p>

<p>Wah On Gold Store</p>
<h3 id="e28">Wah On Gold Store on Shanghai Street in Mong Kok's Most Prosperous Area Robbed by Seven Armed Bandits; Three Bandits Rushed in with Guns and Fired Two Shots as a Warning; Smashed Display Cases and Looted Gold Jewelry Worth Over 1,600 Dollars <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Lately, robberies have become increasingly rampant. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Wah On Gold Store on Shanghai Street in Mong Kok was robbed again, with a loss of over one thousand dollars in gold jewelry. The bandits, a total of seven, were extremely ferocious, firing two shots as a warning before proceeding to rob the store and escape with the stolen goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Seven Bandits Rush In, Fire Two Shots as a Warning</p>
<p>The robbed Wah On Gold Store is located at 505 Shanghai Street, in the most bustling area of Mong Kok, where vehicles and pedestrians travel constantly throughout the day. The store was established on the fifth day of the sixth lunar month last year, employing many shop assistants and craftsmen, and the business has been thriving. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a fashionable young woman in her twenties entered the store to purchase gold jewelry. The shopkeepers, Huang Fangfu and Wu Gui, took out a gold ring inlaid with stones and handed it to the woman to examine. While the two parties were bargaining over the price, seven men dressed in gray and black suddenly rushed in from outside the store. Three of them were carrying Mauser and revolver pistols, two were carrying umbrellas, and the remaining two were empty-handed. They separately restrained and frightened the staff in the store. The bandits with the guns were extremely ferocious, firing a shot as a warning immediately after entering the store. At the sound of the gunshot, the staff were shocked and dared not move. The bandit fired another shot, hitting the ceiling and piercing a hole.</p>
<p>Smashing Display Cases, Looting Gold Jewelry</p>
<p>After the continuous gunshots, passersby, believing that an accident had occurred, scattered and fled. Taking advantage of the chaos, the bandits used the gun barrels and chairs to smash the glass of the display cases on the store front, looting all the gold jewelry on display and calmly exiting the store. They turned onto Soy Street and escaped towards the waterfront. The entire process, from the start of the robbery to the escape, took less than ten minutes. After the bandits left, the staff, regaining their composure, immediately closed the iron gate and then blew the whistle to alert the police and called the Mong Kok Police Station to report the case. Soon, Deputy Superintendent Wilson, Detective Inspector Cali, and McDowell from the Western District, Superintendent William from the Mong Kok Police Station, Superintendent Tailing from the Sham Shui Po Police Station, and Chinese Detective Chief Shi Dui led many detectives to the scene to investigate. They also dispatched a large number of patrol cars and detectives to search the area, but no one was found. They then summoned the staff from the store to the station for questioning and sent telegrams to various districts to arrest the bandits.</p>
<p>Total Loss Estimated at Over 1,600 Dollars</p>
<p>According to the owner's report to the police station, the exact amount of the loss has not yet been determined, but it is estimated that there are about 18 gold bracelets, worth 731 dollars, 7 gold rings, worth 146 dollars, 4 gold chains and 22 necklaces, worth a total of 750 dollars, and 2 pairs of gold earrings, worth about 20 dollars, for a total value of about 1,600 dollars. It was noted that when the bandits fired the guns and committed the robbery, they came with great momentum. The fashionable female customer was so frightened that her face turned pale and she looked extremely distressed. After the detectives arrived and took a brief statement, she was allowed to leave. Also, not long after the bandits left, a girl about twelve years old walked out from among the craftsmen, holding two pieces of gold jewelry in her hand. She returned them to the store, saying that she had found them on the ground. Her attitude was quite calm. None of the staff in the store recognized the girl and did not know when she had entered the store. She was handed over to the police to be taken to the station for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dock Achieves New Profit Record; Profit Reached Over Two Million Last Year; Sir Robert Ho Tung Resigns as Chairman, Lo Man Kam Succeeds <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dock Company Limited held its annual meeting at the Prince's Building yesterday. In the report submitted by Chairman Thornewill, it was mentioned that the profit for the past year was unexpectedly large and unprecedented. The high profit in 1921 was the best performance in the past, but this was due to exchange rate fluctuations that benefited the company. The business results for the past year showed a profit of $2,121,023.04. After deducting various expenses and depreciation, the net profit was $2,600,547.92.</p>
<p>17 Ships Built Last Year</p>
<p>Last year, the company completed 17 new ships, totaling 11,643 tons. Regarding the profit distribution method, some shareholders had previously expressed that the amount should be increased, but for the sake of the company's business prospects, the originally proposed distribution method was considered necessary by the directors after discussion. The proposed distribution method is as follows: (1) A dividend of 60 cents per old share (i.e., 6%), totaling $121,752. (2) A semi-annual dividend of 6% per new share, totaling $45,657. (3) A bonus of 40 cents per old share (i.e., 4%), totaling $81,168. (4) A semi-annual bonus of 4% per new share, totaling $30,438. (5) $350,000 allocated to the special account for expansion preparation. (6) $500,730 allocated to the general reserve account. (7) $70,000 allocated for employee bonuses. (8) $373,107.47 carried forward to the next year.</p>
<p>Ho Tung Resigns, Lo Man Kam Succeeds</p>
<p>Finally, I cannot but mention the matter of Sir Robert Ho Tung's resignation as a director. In November last year, we received a letter from Sir Ho, stating that he was resigning due to health reasons. Sir Ho was elected as a director as early as 1920 and has been in office for many years. During this period, there have been countless years of difficulties and obstacles. Thanks to Sir Ho's accurate guidance and foresight, he has provided invaluable assistance to the other directors. I believe that you will all gladly join me in expressing our deep regret at Sir Ho's unavoidable departure and wishing Sir Ho a speedy recovery. We have invited lawyer Lo Man Kam to fill the vacancy left by Sir Robert Ho Tung's resignation. With lawyer Lo Man Kam's reputation in Hong Kong, his succession to the position of director is believed to be approved by everyone. Lo Man Kam and Landale were immediately elected as directors of the company and were endorsed by the general meeting. Jackson and Williamson were elected as joint directors.</p>

<p>The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Haiphong aboard the French mail ship Guangdong, to travel to Shanghai and Tianjin to inspect overseas Chinese affairs and conduct a detailed investigation for submission to the French government.

The French Ambassador will stay in Hong Kong briefly before leaving for the north.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Unscrupulous Police Officers; Bribery Becomes a Habit; A Letter Signed "Pseudo-Gentleman" Was Sent to a Western Newspaper Yesterday, Pointing Out the Inside Story and Hoping for Social Attention <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (26th), a letter signed "Pseudo-Gentleman" was published in the Hong Kong English-language weekly newspaper, publicly pointing out the "protection money" collected by unscrupulous police officers from hawkers, prostitutes, opium dens, and other places in Hong Kong. The original text of the letter is translated as follows: To the Editor, esteemed sir, I have long admired your newspaper as the most honest and outspoken newspaper in our well-decorated island of Hong Kong. I would like to take this opportunity to report the following matters. I believe that your newspaper will be able to provide guidance and urge the authorities to take measures to curb this. The matter of police officers accepting bribes has now become an open secret. Those who accept bribes are fully entrusted by these unscrupulous police officers and do not know how to maintain "silence." For example, using the best bidding method, "to get the job." What is described below is also clear evidence of an open secret. Hawkers, in addition to holding a formal license, must pay five to ten cents each time to be allowed to sell goods on the street, otherwise they will inevitably be arrested. As for brothels and opium dens, each lamp must pay 1.5 to 2.5 dollars. There are about 25,000 prostitutes in various districts, each of whom must pay a protection fee of 5, 10, or 15 dollars. Those who run gambling dens must pay 10 to 15 dollars per month. In addition, there are other people who collect fees, such as sending "holiday gifts," etc. Although these illegal activities are sometimes charged before a magistrate, those who are unwilling have every means of escaping conviction. I believe that the creation of this bad habit is mostly due to the ignorance of hawkers and others, who fear the power of the police and dare not report them. However, this relies on people from all walks of life to help them. I hope that the authorities will study this. If your newspaper wishes to collect this information, I believe I can comply.

The time exceeded the prescribed landing time (i.e., Oer Due). The school's instructor flew up to search but did not see its whereabouts. As of 9:30 at night, it had still not returned. It is presumed that student Huang was not lost but that the accident or forced landing was due to other reasons.</p>
<p>Missing Student is Huang Saozi</p>
<p>After the incident, the school authorities did not make any statement. Reporters learned that the student was the son of Huang Sao, a former prominent figure in Guangdong's political circles. When the news initially spread, it was rumored that the student's name was Zhang Xue'an, the younger brother of Zhang Xueliang. Reporters continued to investigate and confirmed that someone saw Zhang Xue'an at Kai Tak Airport at 4:00 PM yesterday, proving that it was not him.

<p>Several months ago, an epidemic occurred in Shantou. Hong Kong, as usual, declared it an epidemic-infected port. All Shantou ships arriving in Hong Kong were required to enter the quarantine area, and third-class passengers could not freely disembark. However, now that the epidemic in Shantou has subsided, third-class passengers are still not allowed to disembark freely. The directors of the Hong Kong Chaozhou Eight Districts Chamber of Commerce and the Jiaying-Shantou Chamber of Commerce believed that this measure caused much inconvenience to people from their hometowns coming to Hong Kong, so they jointly wrote to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, requesting the government to investigate the situation and cancel the order to restore free disembarkation for third-class passengers to facilitate travel. Having not received a reply, the chairmen of the association, Lin Zifeng and Lin Yiqiu, personally visited the Secretary for Chinese Affairs yesterday afternoon to present the matter in detail. Mr. Lin Zifeng told reporters that the Secretary for Chinese Affairs expressed great sympathy for the association's request to restore free disembarkation for third-class passengers coming to Hong Kong from Shantou. He has now forwarded the request to the health authorities to cancel the previous rule. This matter will probably be resolved in a few days.</p>

<p>Last June, the Hong Kong government promulgated the Protection of Tenants Ordinance, restricting landlords from forcing evictions. This year, in January, the ordinance was revised to prevent landlords from cleverly creating reasons for rent arrears to carry out eviction conspiracies, while limiting unreasonable rent increases. The general public was very happy. However, the ordinance is due to expire in June of this year. Whether the Hong Kong government will renew it is a concern of the residents. For this matter, the reporter specially visited Chinese representative Luo Wenjin yesterday. According to his answer, the phenomenon of the demand for houses exceeding supply in Hong Kong is still serious, and the ordinance of course needs to continue to be effective. According to what I know, the government authorities have also decided to extend its validity for one year, and it can be announced at that time. Furthermore, according to the reporter's investigation, Macau is also experiencing a housing shortage. The Macau government has passed a law to restrict the arbitrary increase in rent prices, allowing only a one-dollar increase per hundred dollars, i.e., one percent. This method can be imitated in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Qiongdao × Feels Exhausted to Cope; Our Military and People's ×× Strength is Increasing; Southern Guangdong People Fully Loaded with Food Cross the Sea to Assist; Qiong Female Warriors Deeply Penetrate × Den to Lure and Annihilate Stubborn × <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Xuwen Quick News) The Qiongdao war is still continuing to unfold. Although the × army has invaded the mainland after reinforcements, our military and civilians have jointly launched a large-scale guerrilla war, and × feels quite exhausted to cope. Now × is showing fatigue and is unable to advance. It has switched to a defensive posture, but our guerrillas continue to attack × and trap ×, and mobilize the Li and Miao people in the Wuzhi Mountain to participate in killing ×. The recent situation in Qiongya is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Military and People Resist × With Strong Will</p>
<p>Since × landed on Qiongdao, on the one hand, it has released the air of Anqiong's entry into Lei to confuse our side's vision, and still hopes to occupy the entire Qiong. Therefore, it dispatches warships to surround the coast of Qiongdao, block the coastline, and attempt to cut off the supply and assistance to our isolated army. However, our isolated island military and civilians continue to struggle and die holding on to ×. The military and political authorities of Guangdong Province also have great determination to protect Qiongya. Since military experienced personnel took over as county magistrates in the various counties in Qiongya that had been lost, the military and civilians have a strong will to resist the war, and the mood to kill × is even more tense. Now, the lost areas such as Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, Chengmai, and Qiongdong Cliff County are all covered with our guerrillas, self-defense groups, national salvation armies, etc., retaining the vast majority of the land. × is only limited to the cities and towns of three or two counties, and is often ambushed and attacked by our army, suffering heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Southern Guangdong People Cross the Sea to Assist</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Qiongdao war, although × warships blocked the coast in an attempt to cut off our army's assistance, the people of various counties in southern Guangdong witnessed the heroic resistance of the isolated army in Qiongya and were all spiritually inspired. They sent weapons, ammunition, food, and salaries across the sea to aid. The loyal and brave soldiers, such as Feng from Xuwen County and more than a dozen others, drove several sampans and boats, fully loaded with food and various comforting items, and crossed south from near Hai'an Port. They stole through the × warship warning line in the dark of night and landed on the coast of Wenchang County. They went to various places to comfort the heroic soldiers who were defending the land. They safely arrived in Xuwen yesterday (22nd). It is said that the high tide of the Qiongdao military and civilians killing × is admirable, and they are familiar with the terrain and brave in combat. The future is very promising, but the supply of ammunition is worrying. Now the war has turned into a mountain war, and the Qiong people have begun to use knives, spears, bows, and arrows to hold on to ×, reducing ammunition consumption. Furthermore, Feng and others decided to contact other enthusiastic patriotic villagers and make another large-scale supply to the Qiongdao military and civilians, and they will cross the south in the short term.</p>
<p>Our Army Compiles and Trains Miao and Li to Resist Japan</p>
<p>After the Hainan Island war occurred, people from all over rose up to resist ×. Group leaders Feng Baiju and Ms. Liu Qiuju both served the country loyally, leading more than 10,000 people under their command, lurking in the mountains of Qiongshan and Ding'an, and implementing a wide-ranging guerrilla system × strategy to contain × people. According to military news, our army in Qiongya is extremely familiar with the terrain in various places and has a very good relationship with the Li Miao Qixiao people. In order to launch the anti-Japanese war of various ethnic groups, some of them live in the Wuzhi Mountain and its branch valleys, gathering the Qiong people, compiling and training the anti-Japanese national salvation army, using weapons such as knives, spears, bows and arrows, and attaching many long and short guns. Each is brave and good at fighting, no less than an anti-× elite force. If × dares to go deeper again, it will be hit hard.</p>
<p>Qiong Female Warriors Dress Up to Annihilate ×</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strong men led by female warrior Liu Qiuju are all young and heroic, with extraordinary courage. They often appear in Leimingju, Ding Huangzhu, and other places in Ding'an County, assisting various combat troops, guerrillaing against ×, and intercepting a lot of grain and machinery. Several female warriors often dress up as women fleeing from disaster, traveling on remote paths, to lure × army to pursue and ambush them to annihilate them, killing many × people. Now × is always wary, and × chieftain is even more afraid that his troops will repeat the same mistakes, and ordered that whenever encountering women, regardless of whether they are good or not, they must not be shot or raped. However, although × has repeatedly ordered this, the above-mentioned things still happen constantly, which further shows the corruption of × military discipline.</p>
<h3 id="e45">× Nearby is Very Quiet and Thinks of Moving; Boluo × Was Badly Hit by Our; Dongguan × Army Rush to Build Fortifications; The Entire Lower Reaches of the East River are Controlled by Us <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Boluo Quick News] In recent days, our East Road Army, under the command of General Wu Qidawei, have moved into the lower reaches of the East River, cooperating with the teams of Huibo Dongzeng and other affiliated teams, and the situation has changed. The center of gravity of × and our confrontation is in Zeng, The two counties, according to reliable news, our security team's No. 1 regiment Wu Kanjian's department, in coordination with the Luo Kun department of the Second Detachment of the Third Guerrilla Column, is responsible for the front line of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and closely monitors the Zhangmutou area with strong forces. As for the dynamics of the × army near Dongzeng, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>WanCheng × Army Rushing to Build Fortifications</p>
<p>On the 26th, the reporter visited Luo Wei, the special brigade commander of the Third Guerrilla Headquarters. According to the talk, according to recent intelligence, the × army entrenched in Wancheng has about 300 people stationed in the County Middle School on Dongdou Zheng Street, with six cannons attached, and the Ming Sheng Middle School in Houfang is used as a horse stable. There are more than 70 horses, and the × soldiers stationed in the Zifusi Temple, People's Education Museum, and Relief Hospital in the old city number about 400 in total. Since then, fearing attacks from our guerrillas, in addition to implementing special martial law, they have built more than a dozen gun emplacements in the dockyards and affiliated Zhugang and Huayuanling, and the situation is very tense. Cars still come and go on the Wantai Highway to transport food. Although × occasionally sweeps the nearby villages, it is only for the nature of looting food, and it is really unable to attack us.</p>
<p>Zengcheng × Army Was Severely Annihilated by Us</p>
<p>The × army dormant in Ningcheng seems to be very quiet and thinking of moving in recent days. On the 25th, it sent about 500 troops, with two small steel cannons attached, and sneaked into the villages near Lianhe Market in Boluo County from the Lychee Twist side. The intention was to find out the truth about our army. At that time, the Chen Regiment, 12th Army stationed in Lianhe, etc. According to reconnaissance reports, they immediately met with the Lin Junsheng department of the First Detachment of the Third Guerrilla District, intercepted in three ways, and surrounded and attacked them unexpectedly. After a fierce battle for about two hours, × was immediately unable to support due to being attacked from the back and the terrain, and was unable to use heavy firearms. It retreated along the original road, killing more than 30 × people and seizing a lot of firearms and other military supplies.</p>

<p>[Xijiang Newsletter] After Daliang, the county seat of Shunde, fell, the local guerrillas tried their best to counterattack, but due to the weakness of the troops, the bed could wipe out the × in one fell swoop. In recent days, the × entrenched in Daliang has also attempted to attack Rongqi from the Rongliang Highway. In addition to telegraphing the guerrillas stationed in Rongqi Guizhou to strictly guard against it, our West Road Commander Deng Longguang also transferred a part of the regular army stationed in a certain place in Xijiang to rush to defend it, and telegraphed the headquarters of the Fourth Theater to send senior officials to command the counterattack military affairs. After listening, the reporter went to the command to inquire about the news. I was grateful to Deng Longguang for sending a staff officer to see me.</p>
<p>Shunde's Position is Important</p>
<p>The reporter asked about the situation of our Xilu army's rescue of Shunde. According to the report, Shunde is located in the vital point of Xijiang, and Xue Zhangxinhui Siyi's position is extremely important. If the entire Shunde falls, not only will Siyi be threatened, but also the Xijiang × army will reduce its containment and will attack with all its strength. Therefore, Deng Junzhang paid close attention to this. Previously, he had telegraphed the Shunde guerrillas to cooperate in the defense. Recently, he planned to transfer a certain regiment of the regular army stationed in a certain place in Xijiang to aid. This team is a newly established unit with sophisticated weapons. It has been ordered to set off and will arrive at the front line within a few days.</p>
<p>Senior Officials Command Military Affairs</p>
<p>Then he said to the reporter that in order to make the war quickly effective, Deng Junzhang had telegraphed the commander of the Fourth Theater to send senior officials to the Zaiz area to preside over the guerrillas and the regular army, and put them under his control to facilitate the command. The candidates will be announced within days. Once the command candidates are determined, large-scale counterattack military operations can be launched. Furthermore, the reporter obtained confirmed news from another source that the counterattack on Daliang military affairs will be commanded by Zhang Jun Song, the former chief of the tax police regiment and the current commander of a certain division, or will be taken over by Wu Fan.</p>

<p>Since × entered Guangzhou, they have been buying up a large number of traitors and establishing various puppet organizations. However, it has been found that the salaries of the puppets are all paid with × military scrip. Initially, this × military scrip could be exchanged for national currency or small change within the city. However, recently, × has been actively absorbing our legal tender, hoping to undermine our economy. For example, carrying small change or national currency out of non-occupied areas in amounts exceeding thirty yuan will result in confiscation. It has been found that the families of various traitors in Guangzhou often reside in Hong Kong, Macau, or other places. They often wish to use the ill-gotten gains to support their families, but find it difficult to do so. The military scrip they receive is virtually useless except within the occupied areas. At the same time, recently, our guerrilla teams have infiltrated the city in large numbers, and killings of traitors are frequently heard. These puppets not only sell their souls, but their lives are also in danger at any moment. Furthermore, they are subjected to abuse, humiliation, and oppression by × chieftains. Therefore, many harbor thoughts of quitting. In the past ten days, many individuals from various puppet organizations have voluntarily fled due to this issue, including Chen, Feng, and Chen, among others. These people are willing to attach themselves to ×, willing to recognize the bandit as their father, but will either die under the guns of patriotic heroes or be forced to quit due to the harsh environment. Those whose will is not firm and harbor different ideas can serve as a warning.</p>
<p>A Brawl Among The Ugly Crowd</p>
<p>It has been found that in order to promote the prosperity of Guangzhou's commerce, × chieftains appointed someone named Zhi, among others, as committee members of the puppet chamber of commerce. However, these individuals have recently been engaged in internal strife due to conflicts of interest, creating a state of animosity. On the 20th of this month, these ugly individuals were arguing again at the Tao Tao Ju tea house in western Guangzhou, unable to reach an agreement. At first, it was a verbal dispute, then it escalated into a physical fight. Each reverse henchman attached themselves to their master and came forward to help. The more they fought, the more people joined in, resulting in a chaotic scene. At that time, a team of × military police happened to pass by, heard the noise, and went upstairs. The crowd of ugly individuals suddenly saw the × police and mistakenly thought that the × chieftain had found out and sent a team to arrest them. They scattered in all directions, trying to escape. It is estimated that puppet chamber of commerce committee members Zhi and Huang were seriously injured in this incident. Currently, the undercurrent is still not subsiding. It is said that the reason for the conflict is that in recent months, they have been unable to restore Guangzhou's commerce, and the market remains as cold as ever, for which they were severely reprimanded by the × chieftain. Therefore, they began to shirk responsibility, leading to the internal conflict.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Three × Warships Spy on Daya Bay, Cruising Back and Forth, Seemingly Up to Something; Our Coastal Teams Have Increased Vigilance <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Huiyang Quick News] After our army recaptured Huiyang and Boluo, the Dongjiang × army's resupply and transportation were based in Humen. Deliberately targeting the coastal area of Aotou in Daya Bay, there have been very few traces of × warships in the past month. However, it has been found that yesterday, the 22nd, three × warships suddenly sailed into the waters of Sanmen Pass in Daya Bay, cruising back and forth, spying, and seemingly up to something. That afternoon, they also launched several motorboats, chasing and robbing fishing boats along the coast. Two fishing boats were unable to escape and were robbed of all the valuables on board by the × bandits and transported back to the warships. More than ten people on board were thrown into the sea, and their fate is unknown. Currently, of the three × warships, two have sailed away, while one has not yet left. Our coastal army teams have increased vigilance.</p>
<h3 id="e50">× Planes Bomb Haikang Again, Dropping Several Bombs in Gangtou <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Haikang Quick News] After × invaded Qiongya, × planes immediately went to Haikang to scout and bomb at will. As of the 20th of this month, the county town had been bombed five times, with a total of seventy to eighty bombs dropped, destroying more than a hundred civilian houses and causing dozens of casualties. It has been found that after the × planes狂炸Haikang County on the 12th, due to continuous spring rain, the × planes did not come to attack. On the 22nd, as soon as the weather cleared up, the × planes flew to reconnoiter and bomb again. At noon that day, a team of several × planes flew from the Qiongzhou area. At around 12:00, they掠過Xuwen County and continued to fly north. After scouting in Haikang County for a while, one × plane flew into the airspace above Haikang County from the south, flying around in a low circle for a long time. The people in the city dispersed to take cover. However, the × plane did not drop bombs and flew back along the original route. Unexpectedly, when it reached Gangtou, about ten li from the county town, it dropped several bombs indiscriminately, all of which fell into the sea, injuring only one fisherman and causing no other losses.</p>
<h3 id="e51">× Planes Bomb Shantou Again, Shantou Authorities Rush to Build Evacuation Routes, Hua Zhenzhong Patrols Chenghai and Raoping Yesterday <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Shantou Quick News] On the morning of the 26th, four × heavy bombers braved the rain and fog to attack Shantou City. At around 9:00, they entered the city's airspace, circled once, and dropped six bombs on the Shantou Station of the Chaoshan Railway, destroying more than twenty workers' dormitories, the ticket office, railway tracks, and one train car. Fortunately, all the passengers on the train were safe, and only one railway policeman was seriously injured. Then, they dropped four bombs on the intersections of Chao'an Street and Shengping Street, all of which fell on the beach, causing no losses to us. At 10:30, they began to attack Chao'an, Jieyang, and Chaoyang, flying low to scout transportation lines and瘋狂扫射乡村居民 houses. At 11:30, they掠過Chenghai and landed on × warships. Shantou Mayor and Civil Police Commander Wu Qi, in order to ensure the safe evacuation of citizens when necessary, ordered the Shantou-Peng evacuation road to be completed within a short period. It has been found that three-quarters of the road project have been completed. Now, 10,000 yuan have been borrowed from the lottery funds of Zhongshan Park to rush to build bridges, culverts, and unfinished projects. It is expected to be completed in early next month. At the same time, donations are being raised from Shantou merchants and overseas Chinese from Chaozhou to build the road, and more than 4,000 yuan have been raised. Chaozhou-Shantou Garrison Commander Hua Zhenzhong, due to the sudden tension in Shantou, specially left Shantou on the morning of the 26th to inspect coastal defenses in Chenghai and Raoping and review the teams.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Severe Rice Shortage in Shiwan, Starving People Everywhere, The Situation is Extremely Tragic <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a pottery merchant who had fled from Shiwan arrived in Hong Kong. According to him, the current rice price in Shiwan, under the iron hooves of ×, is extremely high, with only four catties of rice obtainable for one yuan. Due to the high price of rice, many poor people have starved to death. Although charitable people are currently holding porridge distributions, the number of women and children who benefit is very small due to the large number of refugees. Because there is not much porridge to distribute, the strong and powerful young people always get it first. They have seen many people starving to death on the streets. He also said that this time, he brought a batch of pottery worth about 1,500 yuan from Shiwan, but it was looted by × soldiers when he reached Leliu, who demanded a ransom for its return. Currently, there are only about twenty × troops stationed in Shiwan.</p>
<h3 id="e53">× Planes Reconnoiter Huiyang <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Huiyang Quick News] At 6:25 AM on the 26th of this month, two × planes were spotted from the Daya Bay area flying over Aotou and Nianshan, reconnoitering the coastal section of the first trunk line of the Donglu Provincial Highway, Hailu-Kui section. They did not drop bombs. On the same day, one × plane in the airspace above Zhangmutou followed the Hui-Zhang Highway, entered Huiyang, and flew over Jiazibu, Longgang, and Danshui, spying, then flew south out to sea.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Shipping Special News <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>

<p>Movies and Theater</p>
<h3 id="e55">Central Photography Studio Produces "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky," a Grand Performance of the Heroic Posture of Our Air Force <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Historically speaking, our air force is still very young, but in this sacred war of resistance against ×, our air force, fighting bravely, one against ten, has long been recognized and praised by countries all over the world. They give the invaders merciless blows, and at the same time, tell all countries that our air force is great and cannot be insulted.</p>
<p>On May 20 last year, our air force made a world-shaking ten thousand-mile expedition, spreading a large number of leaflets over the three islands of Fusang, without dropping a single bomb. How can this spirit be understood by the × of ×? Our air force is protecting the skies of the motherland, crushing the invaders' conspiracies, and not using it to bomb innocent civilians, women, and children. Bombing civilians is 无× and cowardly, not what our loyal and brave air force, fighting for justice, should do.</p>
<p>Now, we are even more gratified by the good news that the Chinese Air Force will be on the silver screen, undoubtedly writing a glorious page for the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Since the war, the staff of the Central Film Photography Studio of the Central Propaganda Department have often traveled to the north, south, east, and west battlefields, conveying the tragic, heroic, and moving real situation of the front line to the vast masses in the rear through lenses, films, and transportation. Now, there is another film with the air force as the theme, "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky," which will soon begin shooting. The screenwriter is Mr. Sun Yu, the director of "The Great Road." The Central Propaganda Department had previously consulted with the Aviation Committee to send personnel to participate in the filming, writing, directing, and technical work. The Aviation Committee sent the fake aviator Xie Taojun to assist. Mr. Xie said, "... When he (referring to Sun Yu) earnestly buried himself in the screenwriting of this film, I helped him by his side, telling him some stories about the Chinese Air Force, and various issues related to air force driving and combat techniques. I am a pilot, I don't know how to write a good script, but I know how to fly a plane, how to fight ×, and how to defend the motherland's airspace. I want to contribute these things to the film industry. Also, I want to accurately describe the struggles, bravery, and heroic sacrifices of my partners. These are what the screenwriter should use as the objects of his description of the characters..."</p>
<p>After the film is completed, it will be publicly screened in Chongqing, and then it will be transported to major cities in western China and various places in Southeast Asia, so that patriotic overseas Chinese can see the new look of the motherland's air force. There is also hope that it will be shown in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The male actors are Gao Zhanfei and Zhao Dan, the female lead is Bai Yang, and many air force soldiers will meet us in the film.</p>
<p>This film, "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky," is indeed an epoch-making and significant event in the history of Chinese cinema. Here, we pay our sacred respects to all the staff of "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky."</p>
<h3 id="e56">Hollywood Stars' Wishes for This Year <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Recently, an American reporter interviewed many famous Hollywood stars and asked them about their wishes for this year. Below are the answers from each star:</p>
<p>Shirley Temple: This year, I want to work hard to make myself interested in arithmetic, and I have to study it well.</p>
<p>Sonja Henie</p>
<p>I will vigorously promote various sports such as swimming, tennis, and skating, so that people all over the world can develop an interest in sports. People who love sports have healthy bodies. With a strong body, they are energetic in whatever they do, and future happiness will follow.</p>
<p>Tyrone Power</p>
<p>I hope to travel to South America again soon. The Brazilians and Argentinians in South America are so kind and lovely. Don Ameche: I hope I can take more time to play with my two children and our beloved dog.</p>
<p>Loretta Young</p>
<p>I want to make fewer films this year, read more books, see more stage plays, and travel to Cuba and other places.</p>
<p>Warner Baxter</p>
<p>I want to have a noble soul and a pure body. Lee J. Cobb: I hope I can speak American correctly this year and eat less sausage (note: afraid of gaining weight, which would damage her beauty).</p>
<p>John David</p>
<p>I will try to make my colleagues know that I am a solemn person.</p>
<h3 id="e57">A Wide Variety of Star Publicity Methods (Continued) <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, for the sake of publicity, the birthplace of stars has to be changed. The singing star Roy Rogers, who performs in cowboy attire, changed his birthplace to Cody, Wyoming, when he entered the film industry, which is a place famous for Western cowboys. However, later, a real Cody cowboy came along and said that he had never heard of such a person. Rogers had to admit that he was from Ohio. Ingrid Bergman made the world believe that she was born in Norway, but now she has also admitted that Brooklyn is her birthplace.</p>
<p>Gene Autry also wears cowboy clothes when he is not filming, so it is easy for others to recognize him among many people, and the cowboy clothes are so eye-catching that you can see him from half a mile away. When Sonja Henie first came to Hollywood, she was not noticed, so she abandoned all colorful clothes and always wore pure white, driving a car that was also pure white, thus attracting attention.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, there are always a few foreign actors who declare that they want to become American citizens. This is also a good way. Remember Louise Rainer? After she obtained American citizenship, she wrapped herself in an American flag to show her joy. At that time, this photo was taken, which is a good publicity tool. Which American movie fan doesn't want those foreign stars to become American citizens?</p>
<p>Even small fireflies are used. Joan Bennett once publicly stated that she wanted to collect a large number of fireflies to raise in the garden. Similar to this is the "frog jumping" competition between Bing Crosby and Bob Burns.</p>
<p>There are many other methods. Danielle Darrieux's upward hairstyle, Joan Blondell changing seven male partners in seven nights, Jack Benny announcing last year that he would no longer perform, Marion Davies having a banquet once, inviting many guests, and the list almost took up an entire page in the newspaper, Mary Pickford saying that her house was haunted, these are all publicity methods. Some, when exposed, are simply not worth laughing at.</p>
<p>Female stars often do some soft exercises, specially for taking publicity photos, not for other purposes. Not long ago, Merle Oberon had a photo of herself running on the beach, which was otherwise impeccable, but look at her feet, she was still wearing three-inch high heels.</p>
<p>Stars often go on "vacations" to other places. New York is the best place to go. New Yorkers are busy all day long, and what they see are all unfamiliar new faces. But if they see a familiar face in New York, they are also willing to take a look. Clark Gable, Robert Taylor, and Tyrone Power often go to New York, and the purpose is for publicity.</p>
<p>Publicity sometimes gives stars a lot of trouble. It breaks up a couple of stars in love—such as Tyrone Power and Annabella—and forces a pair who are indifferent to each other to pretend that they love each other—like Lee J. Cobb and Anna Sten—. It tries hard to promote in the newspapers to make people believe that stars do have some quirks that are different from ordinary people, like saying that Rosalind Russell raised a dozen large frogs in the pool and cured her insomnia.</p>
<p>There are too many. Writing them all down could almost fill a book. For the sake of publicity, they will do many strange things. Is this why actors are actors?</p>

<h3 id="e59">The Singapore Chinese Football Team Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday by Plane; A Group of Twenty-One People in Full Military Style; Defeated the All-Philippines Team 2-0 in the Fifth Game in the Philippines <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report Quick News] The Singapore Chinese Football Team, at the invitation of the Philippines, went to compete. The team departed from Singapore on the 13th of this month. After arriving in the Philippines, they played five times between the 17th and the 26th, winning four and losing one, achieving satisfactory results.</p>
<p>After the competition in the Philippines, they came to Hong Kong by the way, setting three major battles, with the South China Athletic Association in charge of everything, because the South China Association is responsible for hosting the team.</p>
<p>The team of twenty-one people initially intended to take the China Clipper flying boat from the Philippines to Hong Kong on the 31st, but because the plane was rescheduled to depart on April 2, they changed to take the giant Boeing flying boat "Flying Hotel" California Clipper at 7:30 yesterday morning. They arrived at the Kai Tak Airport sea surface at 12:30 noon. Those who came to welcome them included South China Association staff Mo Qing, Zhang Wendong, Li Huitang, and many Chinese and Western reporters.</p>
<p>The original leader, Shen Tiaodou, did not accompany the team on departure due to temporary affairs. Deng Yuehan was promoted to leader and trainer, Secretary Cao Qiulin, Captain Xu Houkun, Vice-Captain Ji Youling, and the list of names is as follows:</p>
<p>Leader and Trainer: Deng Yuehan</p>
<p>Secretary: Cao Qiulin</p>
<p>Captain: Xu Kun</p>
<p>Vice-Captain: Ji Youling</p>
<p>Players: Li Botang Feng Huiwen</p>
<p>Chen Jiawan Ye Maofa</p>
<p>Sun Chunlai Ye De</p>
<p>Li Yiyou Zhu Chenggui</p>
<p>Cai Yuehan Wu Shi</p>
<p>Xia Zhixiang Xie Qingfu</p>
<p>Wen Guanzong Long Liewu</p>
<p>Li Haizhu He Guocai</p>
<p>Guan Xinde</p>
<p>All staff and players stayed in Room 305 of the Shengsi Hotel. According to Captain Xu, who told reporters that it was possible to win all five games in the Philippines, but in the third game, several players were injured and took to the field, resulting in defeat.</p>
<p>It has been found that the champion of the All-Philippines League is the YCO team this year (the captain and left inside forward Bao Seli and left winger Bi Zhi of the Philippine team who came to Hong Kong for the city-to-city competition last month are the mainstays of the team). The Singapore Chinese team met the team in the fourth game in the Philippines and defeated them 3-1. In the fifth game, they met with the All-Philippines team and won 2-0. Based on this, it can be proved that the Singapore Chinese team is very strong. This time they come to Hong Kong, they will definitely make a great contribution and satisfy the eye fortune of football fans on the island.</p>
<p>The team is best at short-pass tactics, and the cooperation is excellent (any football team that is good at short passes must have excellent cooperation). The members are also full of energy, and the headers are especially good, so they won the Singapore League Championship for two consecutive years, which is not lucky. When they went on the expedition, they defeated the elite of the Philippines with a tired team, winning by two goals. It can be seen that their football skills are superb.</p>
<p>Results of the Philippine Campaign</p>
<p>Evening of the 17th: Won against the All-Philippines B Team 5-2</p>
<p>18th: Won against Saint Thomas 3-1</p>
<p>22nd: Lost to La Salle 2-4</p>
<p>24th: Won against YCO 3-1</p>
<p>26th: Won against the All-Philippines Team 2-0</p>

<h3 id="e60">Men's Basketball Game: South China and Brothers Both Triumph; Taikoo's Strength Insufficient Against Kwong Chung, Suffering Defeat <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The public men's basketball tournament featured three games last night. In the first game, Kwong Chung (Group B) faced Taikoo. Kwong Chung was stronger. After the start, Wei Kai-wing, Leung Kang-cheung, and Fung Tze-keung successively scored. Taikoo tried hard to compete. Fung Ki-hung, Kam Kam-luan, and Tse Pui counterattacked from three sides, reporting frequent successes, but it didn't compensate for their losses. At halftime, Kwong Chung led 33-12. In the second half, Kwong Chung's Fung Chik, Tse Pui, Lee Chow-ching, and Ma Chak-hung all scored, while Taikoo struggled to cope, exhausted from defending. They lost 36-59.</p>
<p>In the second game, Hong Kong University played South China. Hong Kong University was much weaker than South China. However, the players worked hard from beginning to end, facing the game with six players. South China, on the other hand, had a continuous flow of fresh troops. The competition was fierce. After the start, Cheung Siu-min and Cheng Yuk-kun scored one after another, living up to expectations. They also made some gains in their counterattacks. However, South China had excellent coordination and control. At the end of the first half, South China led 24-12. In the second half, Cheung Siu-min made a bold move, scoring a remarkable basket. Shek Chun-chi rose to the occasion, attacking from both sides, and also scored several times. Hong Kong University's counterattack was unsuccessful and they were surrounded. When the game ended, Hong Kong University lost 37-6. In the Song game, South China (Group B) played Tsing Chi. South China's forwards coordinated well and were accurate in their shooting. Tsing Chi tried hard to resist, but ultimately lost 44-60 due to their weaker strength. The results of each game are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e61">Welcome Fellow Countrymen from the Singapore Football Circle (I) <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Lee Wai Tong</p>
<p>After the Lunar New Year, the Hong Kong football scene is bustling with activity. The local championship games are in full swing. In addition, there is a constant flow of arrivals and departures. The football guests from the Philippines just left last month, and now the Singapore Chinese football team is passing through Hong Kong on their way back from the Philippines, preparing to give three performances here, to our great delight. This news has been circulating for some time. Their visit, despite the long journey, is naturally something that all football fans in Hong Kong have been eagerly anticipating. Moreover, they are our close overseas compatriots, like brothers. We, as hosts, should express our warm welcome and fulfill our responsibility to ensure they feel at home.</p>
<p>They were summoned to participate in the Philippines tour and fought several major battles, achieving satisfactory results. I believe their performances in Hong Kong will definitely refresh our vision and not disappoint us. However, a football team on an overseas tour inevitably suffers from fatigue and war-weariness, making it difficult for the entire team or individual players to reach their artistic peak in a situation where they are facing fresh opponents. Therefore, when we appreciate or criticize their skills in the future, we must remember to consider this fact to properly assess their true value.</p>
<p>Here, I must issue a warning: our Hong Kong football friends must not underestimate this team of "renowned" players. In my twenty years of traveling throughout Southeast Asia and the Eastern Hemisphere, I have felt that the football skills of the overseas Chinese are most advanced in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Ipoh in Malaya, and Surabaya and Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. The overseas Chinese generally have the greatest interest in football in the above-mentioned places. The skills of the Singapore Chinese team are even better than those of other cities on average. Singapore is a transportation hub where Chinese and Westerners live together, and apart from the weather, it is not much different from Hong Kong. Its football scene includes teams formed by the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as Europeans, Americans, Chinese, and Malays, competing and fighting each other year after year. Therefore, their football is above standard, and when compared with the level in Hong Kong, it is truly difficult to distinguish between the two. Moreover, this Chinese team is the champion of the Singapore League for two consecutive years, the leader of the pack. It is easy to imagine that each player's skill is extraordinary. We should not underestimate them.</p>
<p>I remember in 1928, the Malayan Chinese United Team (with Singaporean players accounting for the majority) came to Hong Kong for the first Ho Wa Cup competition. Amidst the enthusiastic praise of the Chinese and Western audiences, they lost to the Hong Kong Chinese United Team by a narrow margin of 3-2. Their superb skills left the deepest impression. This was their first time breaking through the waves and visiting their homeland for sightseeing. In 1931 and 1932, the Malaysian Chinese and Singapore Chinese teams followed, performing several times in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangdong. In 1935, the Malaysian Chinese team won the runner-up in the Sixth National Games in Shanghai (Hong Kong, the champion, defeated Malaysian Chinese 3-2 in the semi-finals), with excellent performances and outstanding results, which people can never forget. Their full spirit and adherence to sportsmanship are also worthy of our admiration and emulation. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Yesterday's Tennis Match: Ho Ka-lau Wins Without Effort; Lam Chin Brothers Once Again Display Their Power in Doubles; Today's Schedule Includes Three Doubles Matches <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The continuous rain has caused the tennis tournament to be suspended for several days. Yesterday, the sky suddenly cleared, and the tennis tournament was able to continue. Many fans came to watch the two doubles matches and three singles matches. In doubles, Lam Tim-tak and Wong Kam-hei defeated Storey and Farguson. The Lam Chin brothers defeated Nasik and Manlio. In singles, Crawford defeated Yu Peter, and Hung Wai-chiu automatically withdrew, allowing Ho Ka-lau to win without effort. Tong Lin-shun defeated Lam Kwun. The doubles match between Lam Wong and Storey Farguson was quite exciting. Storey and Farguson were full of energy, so their offensive was very strong at the beginning. Lam Wong were greatly threatened. Later, Wong Lam advanced step by step and changed to offensive tactics. Storey and Farguson gradually became unable to cope and were eventually defeated. In the doubles match between the Lam brothers and Nasik and Manlio, the Lam brothers had superb skills and worked well together. Nasik and Manlio were naturally no match for them. However, in the second set, Nasik and Manlio struggled desperately to try to reverse the situation, but the Lam brothers did not relax at all and were defeated again. In singles, the match between Tong Lin-shun and Lam Kwun was quite exciting. During the match, Lam constantly followed and resisted strongly, but in the end, he failed because his skills were not as good as his opponent's.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>(Doubles) Lam Tim-tak, Wong Kam-hei defeated Storey, Farguson, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2; Lam Chin brothers defeated Nasik, Manlio, 6-4, 7-5.</p>
<p>(Singles) Tong Yun-shun defeated Lam Kwun, 6-3, 7-5; Crawford defeated Kim Peter, 6-0, 6-4; Ho Ka, defeated Hung Wai-chiu, (Ho withdrew).</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>According to the schedule, all matches today are doubles matches. The match between last year's champions Tsui Wai-pui and Yun-pui and Olim Chin and Xia Xian should be worth watching. However, the Tsui brothers have improved their skills and have the potential to retain the championship, so it is expected that Olim and Xia will not be their opponents. The remaining two matches should also have exciting performances.</p>
<p>Lo Ting-ham, Lee-kee vs. Miles-nor, Afu</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Thorns in the Future of Our Country's Sports <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xue-cheng</p>
<p>Although we often say, "Turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems," just as accumulated water forms a pond, small mistakes can also lead to big mistakes. To clear the thorns in the future of our country's sports, we must not ignore the smallest of errors.</p>
<p>The thorns in the future of our country's sports are too numerous to count, but to remove weeds, we must eradicate the roots. To clear the thorns in the future of our country's sports is not a difficult task; the difficulty lies in eradicating the roots. The source of these thorns is most often overlooked by the general public.</p>
<p>We all know the importance of sports to the War of Resistance. It is understandable that ordinary people do not promote sports, but it would be very serious if people in the so-called sports or education fields despise the importance of sports. It would be even more heartbreaking if they not only do not promote sports but also hinder its development. Indeed, especially in the education and professional sports fields, due to selfishness, jealousy, vanity, and even being blinded by profit, our country's sports have suffered major setbacks in intangible ways. Regarding this situation, I can cite several very obvious examples.</p>
<p>The establishment of gymnasiums in our country is not only lagging behind but is also mostly managed by foreigners. Although there are some established by Chinese, the facilities are very simple. We should not despise them for this reason, but rather do our best to maintain them. Only in this way can we uphold the purpose of promoting sports. But in reality, this is not the case. Ordinary people may look down on them because they lack a proper understanding of sports, but many people who have the responsibility to promote sports often do so out of selfishness, jealousy, contempt, vanity, and even being blinded by profit. They not only do not support various budding sports endeavors but also "nitpick" and make malicious criticisms, hindering their development with various despicable means. They are especially jealous of those who are more successful than them. But we must also know that there is a group of arrogant and self-righteous sports experts in the sports world who do not seek improvement but simply sell their "native" or "江湖" techniques. All of this can invisibly deal a major blow to the sports world.</p>
<p>In this professional sports field, the biggest reason why many people disregard sportsmanship is the issue of livelihood. But strangely, this situation is also common in various schools, educational institutions, or even between the same cultural institutions.</p>
<p>Between schools, I can cite a very obvious example. In the past, in a certain major city in our country, the football teams of two universities competed in the championship final. University A lost to University B by one goal due to a penalty kick. After the game, the players of University A vented their anger on the referee and beat him up. It should be known that even if the referee was unfair, it was not necessarily because he was biased towards University B. Everyone makes mistakes, and the purpose of competition is to promote sports. If this cannot be forgiven and the referee is beaten, it is a violation of sportsmanship. But afterwards, the sports director of University A not only did not reprimand the players who used violence but instead sided with them.</p>
<p>Although this is not related to livelihood, the main reason is nothing more than selfishness, jealousy, and vanity.</p>
<p>In short, to promote sports, we must cooperate and assist each other and encourage each other to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Selfishness and jealousy are the biggest obstacles to cooperation.</p>
<p>A friend of mine has a deep understanding of various effective fitness methods and has written and translated extensively on the subject. He also has nearly ten years of experience and has cultivated many strong young people. Under his guidance, in terms of physical strength, I have personally increased my "two-arm military press" performance from 65 pounds to 135 pounds in one year. Although this is entirely my personal experience, it proves that my friend has made a considerable contribution to the sports world in our country.</p>
<p>Recently, my friend has been organizing a certain sports endeavor. Although it is too early to assess its value, it is a first in our country. My friend inevitably encountered difficulties when he first started this endeavor. Even though praise and encouragement are abundant today, there is no shortage of those who look down on and ridicule it.</p>
<p>When this endeavor began, some people looked down on it, and others misunderstood its purpose, saying that there was no need for such a move in the current situation. Others dismissed it as a "small creation" and even belittled its due value. Unless one is "selling native techniques," everything must be done step by step, solidly and steadily, and build a strong foundation. We must not despise it because it is "small." Moreover, a "small creation" is always better than "no creation." As for nitpicking, it is a common problem of the Chinese people, and my friend's new endeavor is unlikely to be spared. As a result, irrelevant criticisms are often encountered.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my friend's strong will is not shaken by this. He still adheres to his original purpose.</p>
<p>In fact, failure is the mother of success. For anything to be a "creation," no matter how "small" it may be, it cannot avoid making some mistakes. As long as we do not hesitate to correct our mistakes, set our goals, and neither be arrogant in victory nor discouraged in defeat, and strive forward, the results will never be completely unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The scope of sports is very broad. Even just in terms of sports, a football coach may not necessarily have research on basketball. But there are many people who call themselves all-round sports experts, or even people who have no research on sports at all, who often like to make arbitrary criticisms. This is truly a major obstacle to the development of sports. If we want our country's sports to make significant progress, this trend must be corrected.</p>
<p>In short, to correct this malpractice, what is needed is a matter of character and morality.</p>

<h3 id="e69">On Preserving One's True Self <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Spring Breeze</p>
<p>Lu Shusheng in "Summer Jottings" said:</p>
<p>"Lin Hai's Jin Yisuo reprimanded Heng, Xianju's Ying Rong'an, and Dayou were friends who valued righteousness. When Jin retired and returned home, Ying was about to be reappointed and went to Jin to say goodbye. Jin said, 'When you go out and return one day, I want you to return to me an Ying Rong'an who is exactly the same as before.' Both of them ultimately preserved their integrity in their later years."</p>
<p>Like Jin Yisuo and Ying Rong'an, these two friends who associated with each other based on moral principles, when Jin went out to serve as an official, repeatedly exhorted each other to preserve their original selves. Then, one can easily imagine how others of the same era quickly changed and did not preserve their true selves. Therefore, those who are obsequious and like to change their appearances in today's era are not worthy of excessive criticism.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, ancient Chinese Confucian scholars mostly regarded living in seclusion in the mountains as pure and noble, and withdrawing from the imperial court as the most commendable thing. For example, when He Zhizhang of the Tang Dynasty resigned from his official position and returned home, not only did all the ministers and officials of the entire court come out to see him off, but even the ruler, revered as the Son of Heaven, wrote essays and poems to commend him. For a time, scholars and literati all used this event as material for writing poems and exchanging verses. In fact, such an act of resigning from office and returning home to cultivate one's own virtue has already lost the inherent nature of Confucian scholars who regard the world as their own responsibility. There is no need to exaggerate it and promote it widely. However, although some scholars can break free from the confines of cultivating only their own virtue and share the joys and sorrows of the people of the world, it is indeed rare for them to maintain their original selves, truly act according to their conscience, and seek blessings for the people. From this, it can be inferred that the reason why most Confucian scholars would rather live in seclusion in the mountains than go to the imperial court is probably because they are aware of their own lack of virtue and inability to overcome desires. Therefore, they chose the passive path of retreat. From this, it can be further inferred that Jin's exhortation in "Summer Jottings" that Ying should preserve an old-fashioned and authentic self was indeed based on self-awareness.</p>
<p>Today's intellectual class seems even more degenerate than the literati of ancient times. Yesterday, they were still publishing statements of "The Central Government, The Central Government", but tomorrow they will already be among the staff of the enemy. It is truly ever-changing, greatly embodying the concept of "He is like a dragon." To give a more realistic example, there are many scholars and professors who were writing books and lecturing students before the July 7th Incident, but now many of them are new dignitaries in the puppet organization. They have changed so quickly, becoming like humans and ghosts. The saying in ancient poetry, "Seven days in the mountains feel like thousands of years in the world," seems inadequate to describe this transformation. The most contemptible thing is that they clearly know their lack of virtue and their inability to overcome the temptation of desires, but they still squeeze into the officialdom and the arena of fame and fortune. At a certain point, they lose their integrity and break their bodies, ending up as refugees who can only seek shelter. Some are even more despicable and insignificant, continuing to engage in lowly behavior, pursuing fame and fortune, even after losing their integrity, breaking their bodies, and relying on the power of foreigners. This is not only losing their original selves, but even transforming into their original forms, turning into foxes or dogs.</p>
<p>"Summer Jottings" also says:</p>
<p>"In the past, Wang Jiasou said goodbye to Wang Guiling, 'Our gatherings cannot be constant, but only retain each other's images in our eyes, so that we can meet again in the future.'"</p>
<p>This saying is even more profound than the previous quote. If it were true that one was a human yesterday and turned into a dog tomorrow, then friends would not only not dare to recognize each other, but would even join the crowd in "beating the dog." This is by no means a fabricated lie, and there are facts to prove it.</p>
<p>Can the two passages of literature quoted above be taken as words of encouragement for people today? The answer is: not at all—because the literati class, shameless writers, and frustrated politicians who have already surrendered today have long abandoned their ancestors, embraced their masters, fled to foreign lands, and specialized in receiving Japanese people. Their ugly faces have been fully and unconditionally exposed. What more is there to talk about preserving one's true self? The difference between people today and people of the past probably lies in this.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Rainy Night <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yingchuang</p>
<p>Late at night. The earth is dark and oppressive; all things are stagnant in silence. Only long-legged fine raindrops, glittering and twinkling, softly murmur with a pattering sound. The blurred windowpane is covered with silky lines and fine particles, but sometimes they become very thick, and sometimes like palm-shaped large drops. The finger marks from closing the window just now can still be faintly discerned.</p>
<p>The rustling sound has gradually turned into a chaotic ticking. The oil lamp also flickers, emitting a pale green light. My thoughts have been shattered into fragments and scattered. Annoyance drives me to open the window railing. Before my hand can be withdrawn, the rain scene of my hometown has already surfaced in my mind: torrential rain beating on the jade-like stone steps, the whirlwind swirling in the empty courtyard, the ravaged banana trees rustling, the courtyard wutong trees shaking as if unable to bear the wind; chickens clucking in their nests, cats meowing softly, my kind mother repeatedly urging me to add more clothes. It is as if I have returned, clearing away all the bad and preserving all the good and vital! I am tightly closing the doors and windows, never allowing anything to damage them!</p>
<p>The wind, bleakly sending the whistling silk rain, shatters my dream.</p>
<p>Before my eyes is a solitary street lamp. The shadow of a rickshaw is plastered on the oily street surface. The thin rickshaw puller sits on the cushion, lost in thought, as if overwhelmed with sorrow.</p>
<p>The wind is stronger, penetrating every corner, brushing against the flesh of the rickshaw puller, rushing across the edge of the beds of the homeless sleeping under the building, and awakening their good dreams full of hope. They finally wriggle weakly, quietly calling their poor friends and wives, rolling up their paper bedding and burlap, and slowly walking into the toilet. Although it is dirty and damp, it is warm!</p>
<p>After a series of intermittent honks, the splashing mud chases away the rickshaw puller. A fragrance follows the wind and swirls. Undoubtedly, they will once again seek refuge under the wings of angels, using wine and women to spend this rainy night!</p>
<p>Rain, how sinful! I hate it. I angrily slam the window shut. Fragments of imagination flood my mind again, from the city to the countryside, from the rear to the occupied areas, and finally to the front line. This seems to be my way out, so it leaves a deeper and more lasting impression.</p>
<p>The spring rain should be pattering lingeringly. Slippery mud will cover the fields. Sharp winds sweep this forest to that forest. Soldiers hold their guns tightly, guarding, scouting, ambushing... Blood and water converge, and thousands of dewdrops are like the tears of the people. The howling wind is like the wailing of mourners. Ah, heroic, great! This is a group fighting for the nation!...</p>
<p>——In one corner, perhaps a group of people are weeping and yearning for their hometown: "This spring rain should be nurturing the cherry blossoms to bloom. Over there across the sea, do the cherry blossoms still have their past beautiful appearance? Perhaps they are withered and yellow, perhaps they are dead!... Tens of thousands of people have died, the fury of Osaka. Sixty thousand women came to China! My dear family, wife, perhaps buried in the fury, perhaps given to… Those thirty-five thousand specially made ash bags will perhaps one day hold me… War, what is this thing?…"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, the rain is so great! I deeply love it, I am excited.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Dusk <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Yingwei</p>
<p>A wind from the motherland blows from the distant sea. In this dusk, those who miss their motherland are all afflicted with sadness.</p>
<p>Passing through the streets where people from all walks of life gather, walking out of the smelly main road, the scenery along the coast is still thought-provoking. ——Open your chest and breathe in the sea breeze that still blows from the motherland! But Kowloon, in the nearsighted glasses, seems to be covered with a layer of misty dew in the thick smoke of war… People who have not been able to escape are still unable to shed a mournful face, and in the dusk, they turn their two pale white eyes more clearly.</p>
<p>Who would want to leave their motherland? This is something that no one would have expected! Entangled in the ropes of life, every heart dripping with fresh blood has sunk on this isolated island. Every active soul has been diminished in a cheap sale.</p>
<p>Streamlined cars weave a nocturnal web, and people pouring out of the pigeonhole-like houses surge like a burst of flood. Shouting. People who have lost the soul of their motherland! One cannot help but feel that if there were no dusk, one would not know how much darkness this place, into which the tide flows, would surge.</p>
<p>A paradise adorned in hell. The park is the paradise on the isolated island. Holy women with foreign sentiments, wearing veils, flash two star-like eyes in this dusk. Could this be the envoy sent by the Heavenly Father? But what about the angels of the Heavenly Father? Children who have lost their motherland do not think that the cross is a gift they like! Among the groups of children of different nationalities, the songs of resistance have turned into the noisy sounds of yearning.</p>
<p>The heavy bell is ringing. The isolated island is also molting.</p>

<p>— Wei Fei</p>
<p>Recently, I have not been able to do anything properly. The woman in the neighboring house sings every day with a wide-open throat, very happily and joyfully: male voice, female voice, flower dan, martial actor, Erhuang, Xipi... I am familiar with all of them, but I don't feel happy or joyful at all. On the contrary, I feel heartache and sorrow.</p>
<p>Unable to do anything, I picked up a newspaper to read. "The True and False Wu Zetian," five large red characters, struck my vision like lightning, and I was stunned. I felt both like crying and laughing. Then, from the most eye-catching place, the most conspicuous advertisement column, I saw three startling lines: "The most fragrant, the most sensual, the most lascivious." Ah, my hand loosened, and I sat down on the chair, the newspaper falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Last night, when I passed that theater, many people—men, women, old people, students, workers—were gathered around watching. The advertisement also had those three most enticing lines. On the side was also written: "To avoid disappointment, please reserve your seats early." Sure enough, the ticket office clearly displayed a sign saying "First Two Shows Sold Out," but many people were still squeezing in. Walking to the ticket office and taking a look, their lips moved slightly, and with disappointed eyes, they walked to the front of the advertisement, squinting and lingering on those three sentences. Some walked to the stills of the movie showing today, gazing and gazing.</p>
<p>Several months ago, I went to a second-class theater to see "Taierzhuang". A theater nearby was showing "Three Thousand Female Stars." With the same ticket price, although "Taierzhuang" was fully seated, there were many people standing in front of that theater, looking at an advertisement for a half-naked female star with the same disappointed eyes. They were actually "disappointed."</p>
<p>With a sorrowful heart, I touched the slippers on my feet and slowly walked on the road home with heavy steps, thinking, "Movies are a tool for education, and those engaged in movies are no different from those engaged in education." Thinking of this, I also thought of the woman in the neighboring house.</p>
<p>She has changed recently. She has powdered her face white, applied rouge, dyed her nails red, and put on blood-red lipstick. She often jumps from inside to outside, and from outside to inside, singing songs she learned from movies:</p>
<p>"If you have it, you can drink water and be full... If you don't have it... feelings..."</p>
<p>"Woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo... I don't want... anything..."</p>
<p>When she has time, she talks to people about the plot of the movie, saying how good this star is, how beautiful that star is, how tragic this drama is, how virtuous it is to maintain chastity, how filial it is to beg for rice to support one's mother-in-law. How touching these are! These are deeply engraved in her mind. She will firmly remember them, remember them, and will also be heavily influenced by them. But she has forgotten everything else, even the sentence she used to say: "Bomb, bomb, bomb as much as you want, China will always resist," she has also forgotten.</p>
<p>I often worry about her. No, not just her, many, many people who have escaped from the embrace of the motherland, from the enemy's bombing, from the war zone of gunfire and bullets, seem to be like men, women, old people, and young people who have escaped from the war zone and thrown themselves into this "Hong Kong Sea," sinking into the waves of the sea.</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>Two people walked out of the door, the woman walking in front, the man following behind, the two maintaining a distance of one or two steps, silently walking along a dark street. On one side of them was a quiet road, with no vehicles coming or going visible; on the other side was a courtyard wall made of wooden strips. The lights in the residences inside the wall had already been extinguished. In front of them and behind them were impenetrable, mysterious, and terrifying dark curtains. Behind the curtains were the mysterious and terrifying sounds played by the wind and snow: sometimes wolves looking for mates, sometimes cats calling for sexual desire. All of this seemed to be preying on the night walkers.</p>
<p>He looked ahead, gradually approaching the only end point he longed for; he thought he could safely reach it without any more obstacles. He believed that his work had already succeeded, a cup of successful wine. When he met with his comrades, he would still have to wait a little longer. He began to taste the greatest joy in life, which is when work is successful; even a person born with depression will forget their worries. It's a pity he is not a poet, otherwise he would have a successful poem, praising success. If he were a painter, he would use limited colors to express his infinite joy, so that colorists could recognize the color tone symbolizing the joy of life.</p>
<p>"Comrade, do you want to buy a shirt… No, buy a pair of shorts!… Comrade, do you miss your wife?… You don't have money to write to her? Take this, here are five yuan for you. Send her dozens of registered letters so you don't have to worry later! Hey! Tell her to wait for you, don't let her marry someone else, marrying someone else is okay, but don't let her have an affair with someone else. Tell you, comrade, the nickname 'cuckold' is the most unpleasant. That's right, you are already a cuckold, a cuckold is you. You cuckold, don't bother writing to her, keep the five yuan for your mother as pension money!… Don't be sad! Our comrades are all heroes. Alas, heroes can also be cuckolds! Don't be sad, fight, fight, and win the battle, then give me a young wife. It doesn't matter if you die… you must first tell her that after you die, she must be a widow, don't let your children be bastards… Comrade, you love to smoke, I'll buy you a pack of cigarettes, but you have to smoke it for a year! Comrades, come, everyone, this is a gun, these are bullets, this is a gun, bullets, bullets, gun, bullets, bullets… Fire, fire, fire, fire. Three bullets, don't think this stuff came easily. It was my life that exchanged for it. No, if you shoot accurately, shoot a wild donkey to eat, no you can't… you can't do it. Let him, he… One-Eyed Dragon shoots accurately, you shoot an old bear, the meat is for everyone to eat, the bear skin is used to make shoes, the girls in the countryside make them well, make them well, well… So you can wear them until you're old, wear them until they fall apart. Otherwise you'll go barefoot all your life, xxxxxxxxx Remember, remember my hard work! What are you laughing at, what are you laughing at… you think it's easy? Ah! xxx! Hey, comrades, you can have whatever you want, everything, everything, everything… yes, yes, yes, everything…" (Twenty)</p>
