<h3 id="c1">展開劇運的緊急任務 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陸淳</p>
<p>在日本法西斯的加緊侵略中，中國的一切，便在反侵略運動中發展着生長着。新與的戲劇運動，亦是在這個反侵略的民旗解放運動中發展着生長着的。從一九三〇年開始，隨着「九一八」「一二八」……民族危機的日益加深，戲劇運動更表現了鬥爭的姿態而輔助　民埃解成運動的發展。「八一三」全面抗戰展開後，在救亡熱情的激動下，戲劇運動者更把戲劇武裝起來，形成了戲劇戰鬥隊伍的浩大鐵　。在內賽和形式的急激轉變下，密切地配台抗戰的需要，英勇地把新時代的偉大任務，肩上自己的臂膊來！</p>
<p>香港，這世外的桃源，我們要喚起這百餘尤醉生夢死的僑胞，要提高他們對於祖國的救亡情緒，戲劇，當然是一個很重要的中心工作，是這特殊環境底下最巧妙最適合的持殊宜傳工具—過去一年來。經各方面的努力，香港的話劇運動是已經由沉寂得幾乎令人窒息的階段，逐漸活躍起來，建立了相當的基礎。現在，問題的中心，是進展到應該怎樣推動和展開這個工作，怎樣擴人和鞏固這個基礎—使它在最適合和最高度的效果下　現出來，衝破着這披着資本主義社會的外衣而潛伏着濃厚的封建殘餘思想的特殊環境的變　桎梏，建立起了　正的救亡戲劇來！</p>
<p>當然，在這特殊環境底下，要展開一切進步的文化運動，實在是一件艱辛困苦的工作，尤其是新興的話劇。因爲它旣沒有像有着悠久歷史的　劇的熱鬧有趣，又沒有像規模宏偉的外國電彩的富麗堂皇，更沒有像一切粵語電影的神奇肉感和權級趣，於是，在這文化的荒　中，只能在一小部份水凖較高的文化階層裏兜圈子，不能爭取得較廣大的羣衆：尤其是因烏經濟　其地種種關係，不能有經常演出的機會，在質和量上都還不能滿足客觀的要求。這固然是由客觀環境的格外困難，然血最大的原因還歸究於主觀力量的薄弱和努力的不夠。這前途是隱伏着如伺嚴重的暗呀！</p>
<p>現在，我們已進行着更艱苦更偉大的抗戰階段了。侵略者的炮火是更威迫到我們的身邊了，我們更應如何加緊努力去動員和敎育這里和從各地逃避到來的無數僑胞，加緊把他們的力量貢献到苦　中的祖國。去爭取整個民族的目由和解放。所以，對　最員有政治處動力和感染力的最巧妙最有效的宜傳工具——話劇，我們必須加緊糾正過去的弱點和錯誤，努力克服客觀環境的困難和打擊，積極展開我們的案急任務，有計劃地有步驟地產生出良好的「對策」來—在這里，我謹以最懇切的誠意，根據過去一年來在香港戲劇運動圈子裏得到的觀感，不揣淺薄地提出幾　較爲重要的意見，以供戲劇同志的共同努力：</p>
<p>第一，建立戲劇理論——我們要克服容觀環境的困難和主我的弱點，必需迅速地建立健全的正確的救亡戲劇理論，糾正社會人士過去錯誤的輕視的觀念，使他們知道戲劇的藝術地位和力量以及對於救亡運動的貢獻，引起他們對於劇運的廣大的同情與帮助。一方面加强戲劇工作者自身的敎育，指示和討論一切工作的路線和技術的運用，以培養本身的力量。我們姿求文化界和戲劇界的先進以及戲劇工作者自己，經常寫作和發表叔亡戲劇的理論相批評，把這個運動建立和擴大起來！</p>
<p>第二，加强統一戰綫——只有團結才有力量，只有在在大而統一的組織系統下才能產生工作的最高效能，這是一切工作的最高原則，戰劇當然不能例外。正在萌芽中的香港　劇　，却剛剛最缺乏這種重要的基本工作。一向以來，因爲步　不一致，分工不科學比，不能配台人衆的優點來彌袖彼此的缺點—不能盡量打破各個團體間的界很和各自爲政的弊病，不知增加多少客視的阻礙，减少了多少主　的力最。「香港戲劇協會」在去年八九月雖會一度積極籌備組織，結果却烟消雲散，這這在是一件憾事；「港九靑年戲劇協會一最近雖然在上幾個小劇團的努力下成立了，但　　俟尚少，那些較有力童的人劇團多沒有參加，亦是美中不足。今後，我們爲謀工作的開展。增强本身的力量，必須</p>
<p>快建立一個德匯　密切聯繫的中心，一力而以集體習集體批評的精神去提高自身的敎肯，一方面以集體的行動去集中工作的效能—不論劇人與劇人也好，劇　與劇團也好，進一步以至文化領域裏的各部門，都應該在民族統一戰綫的旗幟下團給起來，發揮集體的偉大力　！</p>
<p>第三，提高藝術水凖——現在，我們雖然不是爲藝術爲藝術的時候，但無論如何，藝術總是藝術；我們用戲劇來宣傳主義，表現思想，止因爲它有獨特的藝術力量。所以，無論是反封建也好，反×也好，表彰抗戰也好，一定要巧妙地熟練地運用藝術形式，才能盡量地表現出止確的內容，才能爭取得大量觀衆的愛好、信仰的。所以，戲劇的各部門，如劇本—排演，　置，照明，音　，以及演員的演技發昔等等，都要給以重大的注意和提高。縱使因經濟的限制，但小要以腦力以精神來塡補這個缺陷，盡量地使每一作品內容充實，使每一角色演技純熱血優秀，每一裝置迫眞而美化。嚴厲地棄過去組　濫造相馬虎苛且的坑玩主義，認眞地使這萌芽中的戲劇成爲一種健全的有力的藝術，掃淸過去社會人士對它的輕視，充分而正確地發揮其積極的效能！</p>
<p>第四，實踐戲劇大衆化——香港話劇的正式搬上舞台和戲劇職業化的嘗試，這是最近的一個進步的階段。但是，因爲集中　力於多幕長劇的公演，恐怕就會忽視了羣衆劇和獨幕劇演出，忽視了深入大衆的功能，以及走入營業第一主義的危機。現在，因爲戲院租借的困難，以及目前大衆的需要，爲擴大救亡劇運的影響計，不應該只演大劇血不演小劇，　不　只在找尋戲院　忘記可以演給大衆看的學校禮　或公共埸所。我們要根除藝術至上主義的錯誤　　，多多努力于適合大衆胃口的新形式的樣求和小規模的經常演出，以爭取廣汎的大量觀衆。</p>
<p>此外，還有一個很嚴　的問題，就是每一個戲劇工作者除虛心努力於一般舞台藝術的研求與演出事務的應付外，同時更感該努力於救亡理論與實踐的學習，不應該簡單地爲藝術而藝術，而應該把自巳鍛鍊成一個民埃解放鬥爭的戰士。權　地吧自己的思想武裝起來，把自己的生活嚴　起來，正確地認淸劇運的積極路綫和當前的緊急任務，以忠實的態度和鬥爭的姿勢去爭取劇作的絕端嚴肅性，把戲劇眞正地獻給在苦鬥中的祖國；以堅靱的精神　集體的學習與工作來鬥爭地克服一切客觀環境的困雖。英勇地負起時代所賦予的艱苦　圍　的使命——只有這樣，才能使這藝術接近於理想的發展與長成！</p>
<p>司志們！不斷　努力吧，艱苦地鬥爭吧，爲了救亡劇運的前途，亦爲了這神聖而偉大的民族解成鬥爭！</p>
<h3 id="c2">過去一年來：香港戲劇運動的活躍 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 范矗</p>
<p>一年以前的囘顧</p>
<p>香港戰劇運動，巳經有了七年的歷史了，自開始而至一年以前的時間裏，大槪經過二个階段：第二个階段是開始在民國廿一年的時候，由國內而流傳到香港的。不過，其活動的範圍非常的狹，只限於文化圈裏，演出的能力也非常薄弱，除了出現於文化團體的游藝會中之外，完全沒有機會。這期的演劇，，是「爲戲劇而戲劇」的，也可以說是爲建立戲劇藝術的基礎而運動的。</p>
<p>這一期的戲劇運動。經過的時聞很長，直到七七事件發生，才大有改變。。這時，國內的劇運已經跟着救亡運動展開了。香港的劇運，也不能老是站着不動。所以一方面機承着以往現成技巧，作更進步的探求；一方而在內賽上加上　的東西，彼此配合起來，就成爲更完整的戲劇。這種工作表現得最顯著的，就是「華　戲劇研究社」，該此於「七七」事件之後不久，在「高陞戲院」演出之「保　管溝倫」和「雷雨」，演出的成續，雖然不是怎麼成功，可是觀衆情緒之高　，却是空前所未有的。</p>
<p>以上所說的，就是一年以前的香港劇運槪况。可說是以後的劇運的前驅，因爲以後的劇連，就是依着以往的路綫而發展的。這一年多以來，一般劇運工作者已經不是單是「爲戲劇而戲劇」的人，同時也是國民族自出解放而鬥爭的勇士。戲劇運動不只是自發展的而已，同時也是救亡運動的了。</p>
<p>劇運在發展起來</p>
<p>在這一年中的上半年，香港劇運是潮漸的發展起來了，這里，我們首　要提起的，是中華藝術協進會戲劇組對於工作的努力。該會爲香港靑年文化工作者的總的組織，劇劇祖不過是其中的一部門，該組初期的人材，可以說是包括了香港劇壇的中　人物，七七抗戰展開後，曾在　賑的名義下在九龍的普慶戲院大規模的公　過「五奎橋」「布袋隊」「黑地獄」等國防名劇。華南劇研究社亦就是他們一部份　要份子配合廣州的話劇同志組織的，到了第二期，亦就是這一年的上半年，因爲各觀環境的特殊困難，他們不得不把陣地戰改變爲游擊隊，盡量找尋演出機會，把話劇多多地搬到學校去，到游　會去，更幾次搬到　頭，搬到鄰近的小鄉村去。後來，上海海關救亡長征團和上海八一三歌詠到香港來，因爲客觀環境的需要，他們便聯合　來，在本年五月八日　樂戲院中公演國防名劇「塞上風雲」，爲香港婦女慰勞會籌欵慰勞前方將土，成　頗佳；同時因爲宣傳方面的得力，把整個劇壇　起了巨大的波灡了—不久在五月廿四及十九，又在太平戲院及中央戲院一而冉冉而二地　合公演一塞上風雲』和血灑晴空，於是香港的劇壇被刺激得騷動　來。——而查港國防戲劇的正式興起，亦可以說以此爲矢。</p>
<p>這時候，香港的學校劇運亦曾現異常蓬勃的恣態，華南中學的「七七劇社」，可以說是最努九的份子，後曾上演十多　劇本，如「春風秋月」一飛將軍」「保衛　溝橋」等及其他的獨幕劇。蕩時候在本港的觀衆之前它是出現得最多　的一個．而且，他們　在春假的時候，一度四鄕宜傳去，因爲它使香港學校劇運和具他小劇團是逐漸逐漸的興起來了，後來，他們感覺到單在劇埸裏公演是不够的，爲着了着實地配合救亡運動，在一九三八年上半年剛結束的時候。他們便更英勇　回內地去參加更觀苦的更有意義的工作了。</p>
<p>突起的職業劇團</p>
<p>差不多亦是這時候，異軍突起　　時代劇團」產生了，它是由過去　協戲劇組一部份主幹人物，（亦就是華　戲劇研究的一班同志）聯台本港和廣　的前　劇人組織的。以職業劇團的姿態出現，凖備作長　的鬥爭。成立後，馬上定下定期公演的計劃，每隔一星期公演一次，希望作長期的經常公演。絆過很　的努力。結果一次一次的演下去。演出的劇有『前夜』『占城的怒吼』『夜光杯』與『油漆未乾』等劇。賣座成續頗佳。在『九一八』紀念日又重演了『古城的怒吼』，把所有的收入，盡數捐出救濟難民。在十一月七八兩大在「普慶戲院」演出『雷雨』和『油漆水乾』爲婦女兵災會籌欵賑　難民。他們工作的努力引起社會很大的同情，尤共是新聞界給予不少的帮期。現在他們已在歐　予倩　生的指導下，加緊排　新劇，凖備日內赴澳門作大現模的演出呢！</p>
<p>中旅到港和解體</p>
<p>中國旅行劇團　也是七月間到港的。『中旅』是國內有名的劇團，演出的整　，經驗的豐富，舞台技術的純熱，實在是給　衆一番新感覺，到港後，的確是給香港劇壇一個很大的刺激。他們演出的戲很多：『春風　雨』『雷雨』夜光杯』阿Q正傳』『李秀成之死』『日出』等。對香港劇運實在有狠大的献。</p>
<p>然而，職業的話劇團體潛伏着一个很大的危機。因爲內部組織的不　全，經濟機構的不嚴密，團員待遇的不平等，工作路綫的不　極，於是『中旅』便在一二　人操縱之，流弊百出，而不幸在十一月廿四日竟告解體！</p>
<p>中仙解體後，大部份團員，依故抱着爲戲劇而—作的决心，另組中華藝術劇團，已經於十月　日正式成立了。得到歐陽予倩幫助，曾經獻演過「正氣歌」。現在　積極排演「新官上任」及『巡按』，　備作人規模的演出。</p>
<p>除了海關長扯團，八一三歌詠隊，和中國放行劇團之外，外來的劇團還有許多：如中國輿劇團，曾在這　演過『鴿子姑娘』，『夜光軒』，『血灑　空』：大衆劇社，曾演過『夜光杯』和</p>
<p>時代劇團公演「前夜之」一幕。「泰山鴻毛」；民旅劇社，曾演過「揚子江暴風雨』：以及廈門兒　戲團出國過港，演過「誰是我們的爸爸」和「小英雄」。最近還有一個藝花劇團，加揷着大腿式的歌舞，演出「血灑　空」。這些劇團都是外來的或和本港的劇人結合祖織，而用國語　出的。雖然成績都很平常，但對這里的劇運總有點刺激。</p>
<p>活躍的下層劇運</p>
<p>此外，潛伏於下層小劇以及各學校社團的演出，在這一年來，也有很可觀的動目。其中工作最努力如生社演劇隊，曾　過「春風秋雨」和「前夜」，學賑會戲劇組，曾演過『張將軍』等劇其餘如前進劇社，眞光女中戲劇組中華書局　劇社，胄年會劇社，螞樂兒童劇團，丁丑劇社，宜訓班戲劇組，惠陽靑年會戲劇社，現　劇社，韌鬥劇社，八一三劇團，蜜蜂劇社，新星社，自强社……等，亦都有過不少工作的表現。一個多月前，九龍—幾個小劇團，更轟轟烈烈地舉行過一次「九龍各大團聯合大公演』，演出許多個獨幕劇。最近，</p>
<p>中旅劇團公演「李秀城之死」的一慕。他們更進一步組織一個「香港靑年戲劇協　」，已經於上月除夕正式成立。將來這一方面的工作，當然更有良好的展開的。</p>
<p>一點意見和展望</p>
<p>總括起來，過去的一年來，港劇壇是相當活躍而熱鬧的，從量上面說，演出次數總有一百以上，幾乎每星明都有二三次演出。從質上面說，所有近年來的創作劇，幾乎全部演過。上演目的大種街：一是對槪分四頭的民衆宣傳，一是文化團體的愛美演出：一是　賑　劇，一是職業化，其中當然還有着共通的目標，那就是藝衛對時　對民族所要負的任務。</p>
<p>在戲劇自身的運動上，也有　很顯明的特　，從前的興趣主義的演劇，現在己成過去，愛美的雖然仍然留存，可是，與其愛美於戲劇，還不如說是愛祖國，愛民族，職業化的戲劇組織也產生了，雖然還未成熟，然而確已踏職業化的初步，由於舞台技術之進步，觀衆之增加，就可以决定距離眞正的　業化時期不遠，換句話說，就是已經踏上逐漸成熟的途徑。</p>
<p>未來的一年的戲劇運動，會成爲怎麼樣的狀態，誰也不能有正確預言，但是　着過去一年所完成的基礎幹去，其成就當然可以估計着的，希望這里的戲劇工作者能够認淸了正確的目標，提高藝術的水準，更努力地更刻苦地去克服主觀的弱點和客觀的困難，把今年香港的劇運推到更前一步去！</p>

<p>— 盧敦</p>
<p>我們首先要弄淸楚的，就是那些不賣錢的所謂國防片子是否就是眞正的國防片子對于這一點，我們對于已往的許參所謂國防片子是不免要發生懷疑：第一過去許多所謂國防片子，在題材故事上，不是千篇一律的公式化，就是過於空想；其次是技衛的不完整，由於故事的於誇　空想，離開了觀衆的生活太還，以致不爲觀衆所了解，對之不發生　感；又由於故事的公式化，使觀衆感譽乏味，生　的說　不起與趣，因此，這些所謂國防片子，就失了觀衆的信用，　怎麼還能夠實　呢？</p>
<p>由於一般幼稚的國防片子對觀衆失掉了信用，於是那低級趣味的民間故事片子，色情片子……就自然而然地大行其道了。這是很簡單的道理。</p>
<p>所以，問題的焦點是：國防片子並不是不能夠賣錢。而過去所以有這種現象發生的原故，只是由於過去的所謂國防片子的幼稚與與低能。</p>
<p>武器藝術的利益性的完全，並不是簡單的標語口號所能達到的，是必須配合着最優秀的技術與最藝術的手段去傳達的。</p>
<p>問題跟着發展下去，說是，目前民間故事，色情，……之類毒素影片所以賣錢，只不過是一時的現象，只是因過去國防片子的幼稚對觀衆失掉信用，同時又因為真的國防影片的缺乏。</p>
<p>粵語電影的觀衆，一般下層大衆佔最大多數，而這一階層的羣衆是對祖國最關心，最熱情的，由於過去香港小販　實運動的空前熱烈，可以為證，而由於這一證明，可以斷定國坊片子並不是觀衆所不要看的，相反地，一般觀衆止渴求着真正的国防影片，——优秀的名符共實的国防片子的出現！</p>
<p>一年又過去了神聖的民族自衛戰爭又轉入了一個新的階段了，同樣地，我們也希望我們的電影又走进一個新的階段，我們要克服過去的弱點，淸算過去的錯怏，努力去於掃去一切腐爛的東西，電新建立　國防電影的信用，站好我們的崗位，負起我们抗戰時期本身必然要負起的任務！</p>
<p>最後勝利的曙光已經顯露在我們面前了，眞正的完美的國防電影也應該出現了！　（完）</p>

<p>娛樂……海角遊魂　Alglerg</p>
<p>故事的背景是一個神秘奇怪得像「天方　談」中所描寫過的地方、地名叫阿爾吉、雖則現在是法國的屬地、城市的一部份相當現代化、　另一在屬於土著居住的部份、却仍完全保留著東方古代的神秘色調、在那里是無法無天、賊匪和亡命之徒會聚的所在，導演把　麼的一個背景、處　得　盡陰森　殺的能事、更襯看一段動人的故事、匪徒們陰險殘暴的行動、使每一寸膠片、都充滿着神秘·恐怖、强烈的刺激力量、</p>

<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>能寫出一點什麼出來呢，近來腦中所常浮起的只是一些數字。眼前的一個，是關於李伯蘭的『信不信由你』的起源的，使他開始他的驚奇的，是中國人口的衆多，據他的計算，中國人若排成四洞一排的走，那末走一年，某一地方，還只走過二九·八四〇，〇〇〇人，若每年增加的人只是總數的廿分一，也是永遠走不完的，這驚奇原還只是數字游戲的玩意，但美國的另外的一個報章上，把這畫成題作「新的長城」的漫畫，却顯出偉大的意義。</p>
<p>同時，却記起房龍在世界地理中所告訴我們的關於人類的渺小的計算來，他計算，全人類十九萬萬的總體積，還不足一立方公里，這樣靜止的算法，自然太偏想像，但我們便寬放成容許每一個昂藏七尺之軀，都有俯仰迥旋之地，則每個人所需要的，也不過五平方公尺，全世界的人口，儘可以安插到南天樂園一座小小的巴里島上去，如果都用二百層的摩天大樓來容納，則有七公里長。七公里闊的地面也就够了。</p>
<p>人類的住，要求是不大的。衣，若在熱帶，則有一片圍裙，或一片蕉葉，也就足以應付，最成問題還是食。假定個人每人所需要的食是一公斤水和一公斤食糧。則個人一個月的消費，就等于他的體積，半年就要等于他所需要的空間，若是畢生所需，有預先集儲的可能的話，每人須有五百立方公尺的空間來堆積，且不講需要有多少地方釆出產。</p>
<p>無論是蔑倫富豪，辟倫富豪，沒有個人有足够的錢可以維持全世界的人三個月的食，食糧在有些地方是用很低的價格計算的，但若投向國際市場，則從是最廉的番薯，也得兩毫銀一公斤，這就是全世界的人每年至少要銷費價值一四六〇萬萬元的糧食，超過近幾年來各年全世界的貿易總額。中國的人口佔全世界的四分之一，卽每日消費食糧一萬萬元，假使中國士地被控制着不讓出產食糧，而單生產棉，麻等原料，則全世界其餘的人儘可專做給中國人辦理糧食的生意，而中國人如果可以不吃東西，當可以換得難以計數的財富。</p>
<p>可是人民的食糧，雖然不是可以換籌金錢。而其潛在的力量，却極值注意，接連三年的豐收，已給勝利排下了定命。我們的同胞多數還沒有聽到過戰時食糧統制這個名詞，而我們正幸無此需要。不久前，第三戰區司令顧祝同將軍說：『中國目前困難幷不大，如果和第一次世界大戰時的德國和俄國的困難比較起來，卽簡直可以說，『我們沒有困難！』以這樣優裕的情形看來，對付那平時小學生就是吃旭日飯，乃至餓學，而現在全部人民都在食糧被統制下過活的國度，我們那裏還有不自信的道理。</p>
<p>然而我們無須受食糧統制這一幸福，在這樣時代却不甚應該充分享受的。我們正推動節約，但似乎還未有人計算這一方面的節約將是多大的巨額。試照上面每人每日銷費一公斤食糧來算吧。如果是飯，這大約有四飯碗，少吃一碗，全國人民每日可以省出四分之一萬萬元。縱是算作最廉價的食物的最低價格，每日也不能少於五百萬元，一年是十六萬萬元以上，這力量讓我們再細細地算吧。</p>
<h3 id="c22">船 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 楊彥歧</p>
<p>因爲自已住在「島」上，所以便想起了船。</p>
<p>在交通工具之中，我最喜歡的是船；因爲船是航行在大海裏的，我愛廣闊無限的大海；而欣賞海景却非坐船不可，所以我愛船，沒有別的理由。</p>
<p>夏天，想像中的夏天，坐在甲板上望海面反映出的夕陽。多够味—可是現在是冬天。冬天，冷的風，重的風。刺臉的風，發狂的風，在海面上，吹起波濤，讓波濤跳起來，跳在空中，像乒乓球落在大理石上似的。道也是海的景色，活的海景，並且，躺在一葉扁舟上，才能領略其中情趣。</p>
<p>船，輪船，汽船，帆船救生船都是水上的東西，而水呢，捉不住，抓不緊，廳着，太陽照着，月亮映着太陽的亮光，星點閃着，人類永遠在地面蠕動，船也永遠在水面游着，游着，游着直到末日。</p>
<p>人生不就是一葉船嗎？從這邊渡到對岸，就算一生。如果船在半途覆沒，那祗好永遠滅亡：如果有血肉，生命，那就掙扎，克服風浪，扯緊船帆，把住船舵，　和跟安靜從困難中擠出來。</p>
<p>海是靜了，水面平了，等待着對岸的光明。</p>
<p>天堂？地獄？沒有船來擺渡，那天能够把脚站穩？東搖搖，西蕩蕩，兩眼呆視對岸的燈光，空待着，一輩子的空待。</p>
<p>漿划起來，船才會動，才會在水面浮動，也才會往前面的海港淮行。</p>
<p>法國的波特蘭爾（C.Baudelaire）說：『海港是給一個倦於人生的艱苦者的愉快住處，遼遠的天，變幻的雲，不定的海色，和燈塔的光亮，組成一幅美景，足以使眼睛樂此不惓。纖長的船，帶着隨波搖動的一些錯綜的帆索，足以使心靈保持着喜愛韻律的美的趣咪。而對沒有野心和好奇心的人們，那夏有一種神秘，尊貴的樂趣。安坐樓頭，或靠在岸邊欄杆上，靜觀那些人的活動：有些是開船出發有些是駛來回，有些還有着意欲之力，想去旅行，或想去發財。</p>
<p>這『一幅美景』，這『神秘尊貴的樂趣』。在海上，在船中，也在我們眼前，更在我們腦中。</p>
<p>我們也有『意欲之力』呢，不是去旅行，不是想發財，是想撑起人船，克服波浪，打平一切害人的魔濤，毀滅一切沒公理的惡鬼；讓一葉小舟，靜靜的浮在大平洋上，看太陽消沉在在西邊的美景裏。</p>

<h3 id="c24">論排泄 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 丁三</p>
<p>我們出恭，撒尿，徜汗，原是身體內部廢料的排泄。要是這些廢料累積下去，那末它們不但會阻止養料的吸收，並且還會變成毒質，而使整個的身體病弱起來。</p>
<p>身體中的毒質，有時潛伏在內部，而致生了內病；有時發出在外部，而生了外病。醫內病，得通便發汗，醫外病，得割洽瘡癤；總之，首先還是靠排泄。</p>
<p>政治社會的機構，有點和個人生理的機構相像，雖然不能機械地看做相同。那裏面也有養料——健全的成份，和廢料——腐敗的成份。要便民族國家强盛，自然得從政治社會的機構裏。不姑息地剷除腐敗的成份，而引用健全的成份。</p>
<p>政治社會機構中的廢料，同樣地會阻止養料的吸收；並且任其生長發展下去，結果一定會變成毒質。這些毒質，有時在暗底裏潛伏，，進行其破壞的作用，而使民族國家生了隱病；有時在公開地發出來，進行其潰爛的作用，而使民族國家生了外病。要醫治這種病，必須全國上下有敏銳的警覺性，向那些變成廢料的毒質，作不容情的鬬爭，排除他們，割去他們！</p>
<p>不過，也許有人要問，這樣幹起來，不是要分裂民族國家統一了麼？那末，我也要反問一句：你的出恭，撒尿，淌汗，或者生了瘡割除爛肉，不是分裂你的身體的統一了麼？這樣的問題通不通？不通！因爲廢物和毒質不排泄掉，不但不能加强統一，而且倒會破壤統一；排泄廢物和毒質，正是剷除危害統一的成份，以便多吸收多增强統一的成份，而使民族國家更加壯健起來！</p>
<p>所以，一些在政治社會機構中盤據着的腐敗成份，陸續地被肅淸，我們不能認爲是統一的分裂而過慮，倒應認爲統一的加强而欣喜。</p>
<p>我國這次抗戰，從對內一點上說，正是一次總排泄，也就是所謂總淸算。在抗戰中，把那好幾年來在政治社會機構中所累積的廢料和毒質——割據軍閥，貪官污吏和漢奸賣國賊，都顯出了原形，而淘汰，剷除；同時把那些堅决抗日，勇敢積極和刻苦耐勞的進步份子，吸收引用；使得吾國的抗日戰統一，因了質的改變而越益堅强起來！</p>
<p>抗戰緊張，那些廢料和毒質，就越容易暴露，同時也就越容易排泄掉。過决不是壞現象，而正是好現象。這决不是分裂了統一，而倒是加强了統一，我們非但不能因此悲觀，倒該因此樂觀，並且還應當加緊排泄工作，使我們的抗戰力量更加强壯起來；那才能够爭取抗日建國的最後勝利！</p>
<h3 id="c25">〔麥與兵隊〕 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— 林悠如</p>
<p>火野葦平著　哲非譯</p>
<p>在目前日本的「戰爭文學一中，『麥與兵隊』要算是一部比較值得我們注意的作品，雖則在思想上或藝術上，此書都不能給我們以什麼深刻的印家；然而，誠如譯奢所說：『在某種程度內，他還能客觀地記載事實，…能供給一些有益於我們抗戰的認識』。我們如能够以正確的眼光來讀它，是可以從其中看出一些有益的東西來的。</p>
<p>作者火野葦平是被認爲「皇軍』中的典型人物，這部『麥與兵隊』是他在徐州會戰時的從軍日記，是他個人的戰楊記錄。不過，從裏面却看不到徐州大會戰的全部戰况；也許作者有意避開這個記錄，爲的是不想暴露他們在這次大會戰中的失敗。然而，在在道短短的十八天日記中，首先值得我們注意的，就是：作者曾幾次叙述了中國士兵作戰的英勇，並不斷地加以讚美，而目，在有意無意間亦承認和揭露了日軍在華作戰的困難，如「戰爭確是艱難，並不如想像那麼容易」哪，「戰爭前途是無限的遙遠」哪，及沿途有游擊隊的襲擊哪，和中國民衆對華軍作戰的帶助那，作者都忠實地記在日記裏面。其中寫中國士兵的英勇的，如五月十一日述中日兩軍激戰的情形：「敵人（指華軍）的頑强和勇敢眞叫人吃驚，絕對不肯退走，有時甚至從圍牆中探身出來射擊，並拋擲手榴彈搏……華軍眞勇敢，在日軍佔領之後，尚作兩次的反攻」。又如寫趙二莊之戰：「華軍眞厲害，半點也不表示退讓；雖用烟幕掩護，施行突擊，但仍歸不成功」。【五月十十八日】他如寫華軍士兵寧願以手榴彈自殺，不願投降；被俘虜的也從容就義，毫不畏怯，就是作者自己不禁爲之「肅然」。抗戰以來，我軍的勇敢，早博得中外人士的讚美，然而，從×人的口中說出來，就越發叫入感動了。</p>
<p>恰和中國士兵底勇的相對照的，是×人士兵對戰爭的厭倦和恐怖，「士兵們個個都是鄉思滿懷，渴望能早日歸國。可是，只消偶然一粒子彈，剎那間就把一切斷送了。……我不願死，我不願死在這裏……我雖相信不乏勇敢，但其不願現在就死在這裏，同是誰又設得定自已不死在這裏呢？」這是何等沉痛的自白，又如齌藤和哥哥兩人（他們只有兄弟兩人）奉命來華作戰，哥哥已在上海打死了，齋藤很担憂自己的命運和家中的二老。作者很同情他。並寫上他自己的意見：「就說我們雖然不惜爲國犧牲性命，但可以省得的命作無罪的犧牲，也可不必。……還是應該看重生命」（五月十一日），旣然要看重生命」根本就不應該戰爭了，但誰驅使他們到死亡線上來，『作無謂的犧牲』呢？難道這不是日本法西斯軍閥的罪惡嗎？可惜的是作者的政治意識限制了他，使他對這罪惡的根源不能有進一步的認識，結果除了咨嗟歎息而外，他想不出別的辦法。</p>
<p>然而，被認爲「皇軍」典型人物的作者畢竟還沒有喪失掉他自己的良心，有時也還有點糢糢糊糊的正義感。因此，他對於×軍的侵略暴行，也不免感到難受。「我每見中國兵和鄉下人，心裏總不免有些異感，他們和日本人簡直太相像了。而且，不時能在他們中間發見係自己朋友的面孔。有時相像得太惱人了。這也許不外是自己的感傷，但彼此畢竟同文同種同是亞洲民族，廣義的思想也相差不遠，而現在居然忍心將這單鄰人們的人們當作仇敵殺戮，心中真感到有些難忍。」（五月十四日）這是作者衷心的懺悔，是他對於侵略中國的戰爭的懷疑相不滿。</p>
<p>這一種普遍存在於×人士兵的心理——對戰爭的厭倦恐怖懷疑和不滿。認識×人士兵的這種心理，對於我們的抗戰是異常重要的。它叫我們堅决地相信，加緊對×軍士兵的宣傳，促他們覺悟，而爭取他們到我們這邊來，共同反對日本的法西期軍閥，不獨是必要的，而且是可能的。</p>
<p>其次，再從中國士氣的旺盛和×人士氣的萎靡看來，我們也一樣堅决相信：充淸反動性的日本軍閥的侵略戰爭的必然失敢，和有着進步性的中國民族的反侵咯戰淨的必然勝利，决不是空虛的幻想，而是歷史發展中的事實。</p>
<p>以上所說幾點，就是我們從『麥與兵隊』裏面所得到的正確的認識。——「有益於我們抗戰的認識。」</p>
<p>日本法西斯的文學「評論家」淺野晃曾指摘年來日本「戰爭文學」的失敗，說：「從來日本文壇上認爲了不起的作品，經過中個報紙雜誌翻譯過去刊登後，中國的人讀來，簡直是一篇「抗日」「侮日」的好材料。』不錯，這部在日本國內還很流行的「麥與士兵」，我們讀了也有此感。它不獨同樣是一抗日」「侮日」的好材料，而且，還替我們的抗戰做了好些宣傳工作！</p>
<p>當然，對于火野葦平的這部日記，我們不能給以過高的評價。無論內容的意義上和寫作的技術，它都遠不及石川達三的「未死的兵。」但較之一　日本士兵的作品（如田漢夏衍譯的「敵兵陣中日記」和一些從×人士兵身上搜出的文字，）却不失爲優秀的作品，書中叙述孫坪城的攻擊戰，津浦南段的行軍，文筆的生動，語句的簡潔明瞭，說明作者並不是沒有文學才能的人。此外書中精彩的地方也還不少。我們不能以「不免太瑣　一些」（譯者的話）便輕輕地抹殺了它。（一月五日）</p>

<p>開賽後、香港會人數不足、先以十人應戰、三分鐘時、中鋒威路臣、盤球勇進、仲云正欲攔截、祇以戰場濕滑、以體倒人翻、威路臣乘機施射、球兒直進網奮、以一比零佔先、中圈再開、東方卽行反襲、澄滔邊彊起義、傳出妙球、德琪不辱使命、一踢中的、一比一打成和局、七分鐘時、香港會左中衛反地加入戰線、廿五分鐘時、國祺交球澄滔、潑滔弄過守乒、成單刀之優勢、及機叩關、爲高拿擋出、失去良機、有頃、澄滔曾先後三次近射、可惜去勢不勁、致爲高拿一一接得、旋半場之號鳴、</p>
<p>易地再戰、香港會努力圖强、四分鐘時地派路蹲伏門下、傳來恰好、當球兒掠門而過時、威路臣搖頭一頂、球兒應聲入網、以二比一之數再度佔先、七分鐘時、東方前鋒、排山倒海、衝進香港會腹地、門將高拿出城抵禦、德祺撥球於洽興、以避其鋒、於洽興輕輕一掃、將球撥入城裏、二比二再戰平手、廿五分鐘時、侯澄滔單騎偷襲、香港會守兵力追無效、卒由潑滔于門前咫尺、踢入一只、成三比二之數、賽至完場時、比較依然、東方告捷、雙方名單如下</p>

<p>（本報特訊）昨天寒風透骨、細雨霏霏、場濕地滑、難于馳騁、足球聯賽因登天雨影響、自難演出佳妙的戰情、對海九龍會球場上、米杜息與九龍會冉度重逢、兩隊經一場水戰　、球員變成泥鴨、人鬼難分、結果英軍又以一些二之成績喪師、</p>
<p>昨天戰情、場濕球滑、控制艱難、當無精彩演出、英軍之敗、因好手不　、陣綫凌亂、哥羅根本爲前線靈魂、因足傷未愈、不能上陣、屈臣本爲後衛良材、因前線人數不足、竟削足就履、奉調前驅、材非所用、諸將當難各展所長、</p>
<p>九龍會慣於本塲作戰、（在主場比賽從未敗陣）旣得地利、諸將又肯賣力、球到即傳、球到卽衝、推進亳不遲滯、佐芝、卑利士、卑路三將、表演佳妙、守衛森嚴、屢拒敵鋒、劾利緊守城池、居功最偉、其餘稱職、</p>
<p>乙組戰米杜息以四比零勝九龍會後、甲組挑開戰幕、兩陣對圓、英兵開始進攻、向前分三路包圍、直撲城下九龍緊紮陣脚、集重兵于要隘、沿途截擊、卑利士指揮大軍、猛力衝殺肉搏、英軍受迫不過、放棄佔領陣地、回師固守</p>
<p>九龍會乘勝追擊、小諾士沿邊進窺、對門放砲、韓尼波路陣前接應、正欲衝球入網、豈料場滑地濕、奔跑艱難、馬失前蹄、錯過時機、小諾士不肯放過、搶進一步、對門猛掃、惜操之過急、皮球越門而過、失去良機</p>
<p>英軍渡過大難、積臣送球場中、場濕球重、離門外卅碼處即墮地停留、恰落在芝維地跟前、維地乘門將未及回師、以急傳轉送前綫、佐芝于廿碼外掃射、積臣不料有此一着、鞭長莫及、大意失守、一比零九龍會打開紀錄、</p>
<p>英軍失球後、努力追擊、乃取攻勢、中路數度迫近、因聯絡疏散、難收大、混戰歷十分鐘、中傷爭奪、各無進展、衣化力士移師勷助擅離職守、冷不妨馬拉巴路衝破重圍盤球反襲衣士文被迫棄防出迎、竟中調虎離山計、爲屈臣中路偷進、打破光蛋、一比一成平手、</p>
<p>中圈再來、九龍會旣勝而和、情有不甘、冉度進攻、英軍門前又告驚險、草木皆兵、守衛合力抗拒、屢救險球、奈高巴表演失常、錯誤頻仍、予敵絳以機會、亡何佐芝得球、引過舉禮地、轉交廖亞臣、單刀衝上、沿邊斜射、角度美妙、積臣無從撲救、再告失守、上半時成二比一、</p>
<p>休息已過、易地交鋒、英軍攻勢轉盛、大舉反攻、九龍會陣地被圍水洩不通、五衛負隅力抗、劾利力挽狂瀾、與卑利士、卑路等同有佳妙演出、博得掌聲讚美、</p>
<p>雙方球來球往、　搏混戰、米隊前線乏一穿楊妙技之人、雖能取得攻勢、但無法再度建功、完塲時、九龍會　以二比一之數再勝米杜息、陣勢如后、【固本】</p>

<p>【本報特訊】毛毛雨下個不停、凛冽的寒風、更是吹得人們魂兒欲斷、但籃球房要、却引動了不少的迷男迷女、把它擠擁得水洩不通、這都是、姐兒們爲着逞英豪、與球兒結下不解之緣、筆者過癮歸來、且把戰情一紀、</p>
<p>首場培道對南華、一般入多已預知勝負、因爲培道是本屆未敗勁旅、南華却連實力平平的西南也打不過、又怎能敵得過她呢、　因之第一節開始、南華卽走下風、但這時南華各將精神還很飽滿、爭持至第一節完、損失仍是微乎其微，不過是二與四之比罷了、</p>
<p>二節開始、南華劇戰之下、破漸露、培道趁羞這個絕好機會、苦苦進逼、弄得南華姐兒、　汗涔涔直下、這節終結、成十五比六的局勢</p>
<p>劇戰再啓、南華頗見振作、煜芬美薇、極爲努力、這節培道僅由奕隱加上兩點旋即一無所獲、所以殺至三節暫停、培道僅以十七此十佔先數點、</p>
<p>續戰之初、南華依然時機不小、奈皆失諸擲籃一着、反觀培道、奕隱矯若游龍、英華兇如猛虎、但南華仍不以着着落後而搖動軍心、拚力相殺、戰至緊張　、美薇更做出很多惹人憐愛的舉動、引得迷男迷女、哄堂大笑、不久、這幕戰爭、才從笑聲裏宣告結束、績分是廿八比十三、培道勝、</p>
<p>壓岫戲是梅芳對華僑、在戰幔未啟的時候、一般人還以爲必需經過一番龍爭虎鬥、才解决最後勝利、殊知接觸之下、華僑却是着着落後、屢居下風、其實照昨晚的戰情看來、華僑除了守光演出最好、榮棠惠貞差强人意外、其餘都是無足稱道、又怎怪終敵不過這實力最雄的梅芳呢、而梅芳此勝、奪標呼聲更高了、</p>
<p>一節開始、梅芳先以月梅暫代美蓮、實力比較差些、是時華僑士氣正盛、因此殺得難解難分、三比三平手後、美薄從掌聲密如軍炮中出替月梅、果然經過這番替換後、梅芳軍心爲之一振、直至美蓮梅開二度之後、十二比五、梅芳佔先數點、是節卽完、</p>
<p>再戰、梅芳依然奮勇、美蓮這小妮子、不動則已、一動即如脫兎、華僑雖合惠貞等數人之力、也制她不來、的是名不虛　、上半場終、二十二比　、亟僑更是落後、</p>
<p>柑子啖罷、重上戰場、這節華僑除由守光連建功、榮棠加上一隻外、竟是梅芳世界、梅芳單由美蓮一人、已獲六分之多、所以這節終時、三十比十六、華僑英雌、　爲氣短、</p>
<p>末節、華僑仍思收復失地、但是祇憑榮棠守光二人之力、又怎能如願以償呢、所以接戰之下、華僑仍于處是下風的地位、直至終塲、四十二比二十六、梅芳高奏勝利之歌而返、（藍底人）</p>

<p>汪兆銘在其反對中央國策的計劃暴露後，倉皇離渝出國，本已失去政冶家的本色；乃於出國以後，繼又發表所謂覺電，公然違背十央旣定國策，遵照×國首相宣言，主張舉國降×，更自暴露具所謂反對中央國策，竟是叛黨叛國的陰謀；中央决議文中嚴正指汪氏通×叛黨危害國家，而對汪仍祇限於開　黨籍撤除職務，可謂寬　有加，全文武官員各界民衆方恨之餘，除紛電斥汪狂謬，擁護中央决議以外，所以對汪仍　悔關　新者，原視汪氏仍爲中國人，目其過去曾爲中國的政治家而已。在汪氏爲自處計，雖不能剖腹以謝國人，亦當瞻顧時勢，知難而退，　身待罪。此正愛惜　氏者之理想，亦可謂一般民衆最低限度的希望。</p>
<p>然而據最近各方消息，證明汪氏不僅無意悔禍，並且還在暗中加緊活動，一方面利用其宣傳工具，揑造虛偽消息，散佈無恥謠言，不是說國民政府左傾，共產黨包圍將委員長，便是說政府將頒令沒收私人存欵，句括滬港銀行在內，其怪誕不經，固無足論，而箕離間我黨派合作與官民團結，則用意惡毒，與×方伎倆如出一轍—另一方面，還擬組織新黨　作爲組織傀儡政府的準備，這種行爲，在汪氏個人政治道德的墮落，固無足掛齒；而對于中國人的侮辱，恐怕就是過去愛惜汪氏與忠告汪氏的人，今後亦將不堪容忍了！</p>
<p>現據重慶電訊，全國各將領各部隊各行政長官和滬港南洋各地民衆團體擁護中央懲處汪氏的電報，如　片飛到，這些電報中間，如張發奎余漢謀等，並主張中央通緝汪氏歸案；如各省長官及華北民衆團體，並請開除汪的國籍，沒收汪的財產地產；如滬港南洋各界，除上述留求外，並表示不承認汪爲廣東人，及請求立卽查禁具宜傳工具。這種消息，更可証明汪氏如再不悔禍自新，而逞其難倒黑白感亂人心的故長，則天下雖大，汪氏將無容身之地，得罪於民，無所禱也，何之悔禍者，當已知道有一個限度了！</p>
<h3 id="c51">歐局演變中　一個新因素 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— （本報倫教特約通訊）　叔棣叔棣</p>
<p>最近這些天來，在一般歐洲形勢的發展中，尤其在英法，對外的未來步調中，加入了一個新的因索；這，就是最近美國方面對世界局勢態度的突然積極。</p>
<p>我們分折一下英國朝野與對於這個新因素的心理反應，那成分，很明鮮的有南個：第一，自然是發出了種如釋重負的感覺，說話增加了力量與勇氣；第二，以苟安觀念爲出發點，英國的一部份人士，由此，又感釗微微的担心——　們怕因爲藥國與德日意三侵略國公開衝突中，把英國也捲了淮去。</p>
<p>雖然心理上有着這種矛盾，然而，至少在所謂「四强公約」也者未結成以前，英法的對外步調上，確實的，是受到了美國這種態度的重大壓力。當然的，以美國可能援助爲背景，而　圖一舉而和德意　成『四强公約』的張伯倫，達拉第兩內閣，在現在，是感到大大的棘手，而不得不攷慮一下，和這新內素適應的步驟了。</p>
<p>美國這種態度突然爆發的動因，據此地所知，最主要的：一是由於　近對於德日意三侵略國在美洲秘密機關的總破獲，結果，發現了德國對於加拿大，日本對於巴拿馬邊河附近各國，以及意大利對於南美洲導國的重大聯合陰謀。二是由於英法現內閣固執地疏遠　聯，失去了應付德意的力量，張伯倫達拉第兩內閣所率行的外交政策，引起了美國的深刻的不安與懷疑。而另外一個誘導這種態度爆發的因棄，却是因爲德國虐害猶太人而引起的美德兩國間的互相攻訐。</p>
<p>可是，一直到目前爲止。美國方面。並沒有向英法　國當局，　出她的具體路線；據所有公然和幕後行動看來。美國這種積極的能度，似乎還僅僅達到督促英法輿論牽制英法當局的地步。</p>
<p>第一，美國在走向所謂「四強公約」路上所放下的障礙</p>
<p>在不久以前的一篇通訊裏，記者曾指出過陽洲所謂「四强公約」的暫時擱淺；現在，假如我們換一個角度去看，英法德意四國，果然誠心地去實現這個公約的話，那末，在它達到的路上。第一步還必須克服美國所放下的障碍。最大的障阻，是關於殖民地的割讀。大槪在上月（十一月）下旬的時候，那時，正是割讓殖民地問題喧呼得最起勁。據英國政府中某部份人　的計劃，是打算把非洲西都一部份劉給德國，這非正式的計劃，立刻　到了美國的「自宮」。於是，羅斯福總統立刻請英國駐美大使林德賽會面，提出了一個相對的要求：假如這個計劃實現，那末，美國也要向英法要求和德國在殖民地權利上的平等，對於某部份在美國勢力國內的英法領土，美國　備提出建立海軍根據地，或完全割讓的要求。理由是，假如德國在西非建立根據地，那末美國的大西洋航綫，在戰時定會受到德國的騷擾，爲了安全，美國祇有要求和德國平等．同樣的，思的通知，同時又送到了法國的外交部．於是，英法兩國當局　議的結果，再加上其他情形的攷慮，决定把這個計劃　時欄　。跟着，就由英國殖民地大臣馬爾康麥克唐納，和法國的外長龐萊，分別而可是同時地止式發表了否認權類計劃存在的聲明。構成其次的障碍的，是美國與德意間因虐害猶本人而引起的外交關係的緊張。現在，美國與德國，已經彼此互相召囘了各自的大使；在這時，假定英法去積極進行「四强公約」的話，那末，趨勢是非常可能的，美國會立卽宣佈與德國完全斷絕外交關係，率擊英法給「四强公約」以一個致命的打擊。當然，决定暫時停止「四强公約」進行後的張伯倫內閣，對於美德閒外交關係緊張，是求之不得的，因爲，可以利用這時機，去埋頭於軍傭的建設，暫緩德國限制軍備要求的提出。這裏，就是張伯倫對於不久以前德國國家銀行總裁沙赫特訪英時避不見面的根源，而且更進一步，在下議院義，也居然說出德國不進一步表示渴願「和乎』姿譴時，英德關係無法冉加改進。</p>
<p>第二，美國在英法對日意外交政策中所給的暗示</p>
<p>過去幾個月，英國張伯倫首相一流人在解釋對德，意讓步時，往往要拉上美國對遠東方面不和英國合作，因而英國腹背受夾　爲　口，可是這一周，美國却突然公開表示它的對遠東的態度。最明願的，據我們知道的，這兩個月來，已　有了三次：第一次，是歐洲危機緊張的時候，美國國務卿　爾正式向英國保證，寫一英國海軍在歐洲應付　意時，美團　東海軍，一定和英國合作，應付日本。第二次，在廣州漢口渝陷後，英閱少數動搖人士，又在竊竊計劃和日本開始談判，在華南先成立局部妥協的時候，美國突然向日本提出遵守「九國公約」的聲明，同時，要求英　作了同樣的步驟。第三次；觀是最近的道囘對中國的信用貸欵，我們身在這裏的中國同胞，當目擊到英國少數人士，又在做着「調解」「妥協」的好夢，而根本不願意援助中國澈底擊耽日本時，忽然見到美國的毅然舉動，眞是不禁生出了說不來的莫大感動。所以泰晤士報駐美記者，立刻把美國這一舉動的根本意義，報告了給英國人士，那是：（一）美國對於日本所宣稱的任何所謂「旣成事實」，絕無承認的可能；（二）美國尤其不相信日本的侵略，已經產生了什麼「旣成的」事實。緊接著，同爲英國保守黨兩大識關報之一的每日電報訊的駐美記者，也立刻　告給英國人說：美國官方意兒，　爲日本的經情形，己經非常危念；而時間是站在中國方面的，祗要中國始終保守目前這種旺盛的士氣，最後一定可以戰勝日本，於是為了表示和美國調步一致起見，英國也立刻答應了醞釀已久的信用貸欵的一部份，可是記者個人的看熆，英國的這一舉動？實際是大半被動地響應美國，而　不是主動地放棄她那「妥協」「調解的想頭」，進一步澈底援助中國，雖然英團全國的輿論，對這一次舉動，一度地加以頌讚。不過，趨勢已經非常明顯了最近的將　，美國什遠東外交政策上，已經又取得了傳統的對於英法在該方面外交的領導作用。在這種英法在歐洲自願不暇的時候，遠東方面，短時期內，英法當唯美國的馬首是瞻。</p>
<p>西班牙問題上。美國對於意人利要求的佛朗哥的完全勝利，也有着深深的　惡與不安。據發現的意大利的秘密計劃，是預備等佛朗，確立政權後，然後利用西班牙血統關係，向南美各國伸張勢力。這一點，美國已經向英法當局致送了難以默視的通知。所以，對於未來的張伯倫。奠索里尼的羅馬談話，却是一個重大的難關，前些時這裏傳說　，英法在莫索里尼允許脫離德意軸心的條件下，或許可以滿足索里尼的要求，但這兩大來，據說，又有一個新計劃在起革之中，這個新計劃，是打算把西班牙目前的內戰，由國際主持下加以停止，然後，休戰一二年後，再邀集兩方代表。由團際臨；開會謀一個「合理的」解决。</p>
<p>總之，美國積極態度，對於英法外交政策的作用，是已經　　來了。</p>
<p>十二，廿四。</p>

<h3 id="c52">辨奸 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>三民主義，抗戰建國綱領，衡山會議五方針，及最近蔣委員長駁斥近衛宣言，是救國之正道，不容有絲亳出人。如果有人陽奉陰違，有什麻辦法可以作系統的發覺呢？這是值得考慮的一个重要的問題。我現在提出辨奸路線五條，藉作國人商榷的底子。是否有當，還望大家指敎。</p>
<p>（一）應該眞幹的，他假幹。掛羊頭賣狗肉是屬于這一類。從前有一個地方掛着開放民衆運動的招牌，一面收買乞丐遊行，一面大捕眞正爲民衆服務的人。我那時寫了四句小詩記這件事說：「假的幹，小洋兩毛：眞的幹，捉進監牢。」汪精衛拿着全面抗戰的題目來做反對游擊的文章，簡直是在羊肉裏夾着一些狗肉。</p>
<p>（二）應該窮幹的，他浪費的幹。中國是个窮國，開戰以來更窮，萬事都要窮幹才幹得出去。如果有人把一件事浪費的幹，等到辦別的事就無錢去辦，是不啻把別的重要的事擠了出去。惟獨窮幹才能把一切重要的事兼籌並顧。若只管在一件事上揮霍金錢如糞土，使得別的事情都躭誤掉，這是很可疑的。</p>
<p>（三）應該合幹的，他分開來幹。譬如抗戰最後勝利要靠全民族團結，就要靠國共合作。是要大家一齊起來幹才幹得成功。日本就不歡喜這一道，所以提出共同防共的陰謀。日本防共的目的是要利用我們去代他打蘇聯，如果我們墜入他的詭計，簡直是亡國。國共是不可分家，不會分家·日本和漢奸是白費心機。我們老百姓不但是國共合作的媒人而且是國共合作的天主敎的神甫，只願他們齊眉到老，不許他們離婚。但是日本總想以華制華，漢奸仰其鼻息，總想挑撥離間。一次十幾個人會議說：「我們這個戰再要打下去。勝利不屬於日本，不屬于國民黨，只屬于共產黨。」這些人不啻權是日本的代言人。我所要說的是：如果我們團結到底，勝利是屬于整個中華民族·國民黨與共產黨都有份。現在有人要想分離中國的實力，削弱中國的團結，那就是應該被偵察的人了。</p>
<p>（四）應該快幹的，他慢慢的幹。中國的兩隻大手：一是西南大鐵道；二是西北大鐵道。要這兩隻手快快的伸出去，快快的拿着東西來，能快快的把日本×國主義打出去。這兩隻手都已經快快的伸出去了嗎，？誰在那兒掣肘呀？？</p>
<p>（五）應該大幹的，他小小的幹。新近美國要訓練十萬飛機駕駛員。照人口比例算起來，中國應該有駕駛員四十萬。打個一折也要四萬。再打個一折也要四千。可是從前意大利來的顧問是主張飛機師的訓練，寧缺毋濫，貴精不貴多。這是多麼好的盾牌呀。連胡××先生也代這種漢奸理論鼓吹。我這次在海防遇着一位體育家。他說他和一百六十二位體育專科學生去投考航空學校，結果只取兩个人。飛機師雖精，人少則不够作戰，因此只見　機來華，不見華機去日。我們有許許多多事是受了漢奸欺騙，以至大事小做了。</p>
<p>這五條辨奸的路線是應該彼此緊接着去追究的。應該眞幹的，他假幹，可疑。眞幹了，而是應該窮幹的，他浪費的幹，可疑。眞幹了，窮幹了，而是應該合幹的，他分裂的幹，可疑。眞幹了，窮幹了，合幹了，而是應該快幹的，大幹的，他慢慢的幹，小小的幹，可疑。疑則跟着路線追踪而騐，則漢奸可以肅淸。有時奸與庸混。但故意爲奸，無意爲庸，生死存亡之秋，小才不可大用，庸人也不可久留。</p>

<h3 id="c53">國民援助抗戰的新任務　——發展一元還債運動的突擊隊！ <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>目前時局有三大樂觀現象：第一是汪精衛通×叛國陰謀的敗露，對內可以減少今後全國團結持久抗戰途上的重大礙障與陷阱，對外亦已塞斷跑向×國帮兇的德意法西斯反共路線的懸崖絕路；第二是×國近衛內閣的倒台和平沼內閣的成立，更明顯地暴露了日本法西斯侵略者决心滅亡整個中國，更明顯地暴露了日本法西斯侵略者决心棣立東亞「新秩序」，這更堅定了中國抗戰到底的决心，也更確定了民主和平名國的自衛，只有聯合起來援華制日的一條路；第三是英美對遠東政策漸轉於積極，而英美兩國對華巨額信用貸欵的成立，便是英美等和平民主各國更積極地實行援華制日的先　·綜合這三件最近事實，證明了我們團結抗戰的前途非常樂觀，世界和平前途亦　此微露光明的曙色·尤其是英美對華信用貸欵，一面證明了我們過去一年半的英勇抗戰，並沒有落空，我們已經光大了中華民族優秀偉大的傳統，我們巳經增高了中華民國的國際地位：另一面則因此特別發揚了我們的民挨自尊心自信心，克服　觀情緒，粉　妥協心理，走向英勇鬥爭的光明前途。</p>
<p>因爲我們明白，英美爲什麼貸款於我國呢？第一，是由於我國一年半英勇抗戰；並且堅决表示抗戰到底的决心。第二，是由於我國抗日各黨谷界統一戰線的進步，我們在一年半內·先後克服了×人漢奸的離間分化妥協調停的陰謀，先後過渡了軍事政治以至經濟上的許多難關，使英美列强認淸中國人團結起來的力量是無限偉大的·認淸中國國民政府充分具備團結全國　持抗戰的力量·認淸中國是有其前途的；第三，是由於我國政府本自力更生的國策，力爭外援，因爲自力更生，所以一切對外舉債都是有計劃的有辦法的，更可堅定列强的信任；因爲力爭外援，所以列强不願放過利人利己的優先光榮的機會；第四，是由於日本在遠東的發展，日漸証明其與歐美列强尤其是央美法蘇比荷各國的利益衝突，是不冊解消的，而英美從本身及相互間利害關係上亦　開始合作的傾向，英美兩國已爲上述四個原因而遂漸推進其援華制日的步驟了—同時不可忽略的是，由於央美援華，必然更會影響到法國·特別是給蘇聯以進一步援助我國的更便利的條件—最近因漁約交涉所引起的日蘇間的風雲·固然使人懷念到社會主義的蘇聯的「確够朋友」，而我西部後方的建與戰略反攻凖備上，更無庸諱言的，蘇聯止在竭盡其合法的最忠誠最熱烈的援助！</p>
<p>我們在這種新的形勢之下，尤其是在國際友邦這樣援助我們抗戰建國的形勢之下，要怎樣自相勉施盡心竭力來援助政府抗戰建國呢！由上海大美晚　讀奢徐君發表而日漸　及各地的「一元還債動運」，實在可算是給予發出上述問題的國人的一個最好的囘答—上二月十七日上海華文大美晚報刊載，讀者徐克合君，鑒於國　嚴重之際，英美各國，貸欵援華，歡忭之下，發起「一元還債運動」，以表示中國人民維護政府之誠，以堅定國祭對華援助之心。其後又有該報讀者張婉莘君，貢献還債運動意見·以爲「可將此項献金，呈之於各地中央銀行，在英美貨欵尚未到期之前，政府可先利用此項献金，擴大抗戰建國工作。此於政府財政，旣屬大有裨益，而於抗戰資源，戰時建設，亦可無處匱乏」，其後不僅上海市民，紛起響應，成續可觀，遠及本港，這種一元還價運動，亦巳熱烈展開。現在本港各僑團對此努力進行，華　會已分函各名流募捐，敎聯　則領導學生參加，眞是令人歡忭的現象。甚至　人某氏，亦聞而感動，義捐兩元—不過我們還應在這裏特別指出一元還債運動的重要意義。第一，熱烈展開這一運動，可以提高全國人民援助抗戰的積極性；可以證明全國人民堅决支持　戰擁護政府的自覺；可以使不願做奴隸的廣大羣衆成爲援助抗戰的不可抵抗的　潮，日本法西斯侵略奢將　不起我們熱潮的衝洗—第二，熱烈展開一元　　　　；同時可以加　强政府與人民親密合作的關係，打破親日漢奸民族叛徒及托派份子的挑撥離間·人民信任政府，政府依靠人民，則眞可以說一句：「伺敵不可摧」—第三，更明顯的，這種運動可以增加政府堅持抗戰的决心·提高政府在國際上的威信；特別是當此叛　汪精衛等以　謀敗露止籍一切陰謀以圖削强政府威信的時候，這一運動的熱烈進行，更有其偉人的意義—第四，這種運動的發展，還可以增强國際和平人士與和平民主各國對中國的　情援助，尤其是蘇聯。我們在這裏應該十分明白，我們熱烈展開一元還債運動，是稱助政府解決困難，和爭取抗戰勝利快一點到來的神聖的緊急的任務！</p>
<p>每一個不願做奴隸的中國國民，應該在　神　緊急任務的號召之下振奮起來，我們希望輿論界把强　這个號召發展一元還僓運動作爲目前最重要的工作，喚起，組織並指導我們周圍有血性有骨氣的同胞們，熱然參加這一運動；同時我們更希望各界認定一元還債運動是國民援助抗戰建國的新任務，爲了這个神聖的緊急的任務，我們應該各從所有工人、農民、青年、婦女、商人、自由職業者、學生、文化人、兒童與同鄉會等一切集團中，建立並發展一元還僓運動　突擊隊，大　興奮、熱烈地參加·經常地舉行光榮的競賽—我們要　每一界每一團體每一地區產生出最光榮的得錦標的時代英雄！</p>

<p>【本報重慶特約航訊】冬天的重慶，最難看到的是太陽，二十八年的元旦日，天氣情和　初春，太陽發出了燦爛的光輝，鮮紅的國旗在家家戶的門前或窗口隨風飄揚，道上的行人摩肩接足的挺起胸膛和滿面笑容，同是慶賀我們抗戰的元旦，也是象微着我們國家抗戰建國未來的光明吧！</p>
<p>上午十點鐘，公園網球塲的露天音樂大會開幕了，這大會是由中國製片廠主持舉辦的，除了該廠全體男女演員担任演唱外。行營的軍樂隊亦被邀請參加演奏軍樂，球場正中搭着一座可容二三十人的座台，參加的羣衆週圍約有萬餘之衆，主席是郭沬若先生，他的演詞的主要點，就是「今天在本市有七十萬人，全川有七千萬人，全國有四萬萬五千萬人，都狂熱地慶　我們一十八年的元且，在這狂熱的慶祝當中，我們最少應完成兩個任務，第一是打倒日本×國主義，第二，是建設和平幸福的新中國，這兩個任務，我們用什麼方式去完成呢？那就是把自己的一切都献給國家。現在×人已成强弩之末，我們正好利用這機會，給他一個，四而楚歌」明年今天在南京慶祝元旦』。熱烈的掌聲稍停，歌詠隨着開始了。</p>
<p>量先是軍樂，奏演的節目爲德國騎兵進行曲，音調悠揚，沉靜中寓一種肅殺之氣，次由中國製片廠全體演員，依照預定節目，開始唱歌，『靑天白日滿地紅』「爲祖國戰爭」「上前綫」「砲兵歌」「收復我失地」「長城謠」「上戰場」等曲，每節演完了，塲內週圍異口同聲喊着「再來」「再來」，然而時不我與，正午十二點鐘已鳴，大會在軍樂悠揚中閉幕了。</p>
<p>下午三時，含着雙重意義——祝賀新年，宜傳抗戰建國的大會，在夫子池開始了。廣塲上劃着分明的地區，到會的團體分出各自的崗位，民衆及學校在左，黨政機關和軍警在右，時鐘才報兩點，各團體已浩浩蕩蕩相繼而來，爲的是準備散會後接着火炬遊行，他們每隊的手裏都提着燈籠，燈的式樣各盡五光十色；有龍燈，塔燈，各種水果形的燈，字形的　，各燈併合　來，便是整句的標語：如「軍民合作」「抗戰到底」等等，當各龍燈到塲時，還鳴着鑼鼓，飛舞着入塲，引發老龍舞蹈的，有化作孫悟空，有化成猪八戒，雖然已是隆冬季候，他走在龍前引導時，手上還搖着巴蕉葉的大扇，其興奮的情况，爲川省以前所未有，足証中華民族在×人的炮火下振作起來，在努力抗戰的過程中少壯起來。</p>
<p>大會在炮聲和音樂聲中開幕，由蔣市長主席領導行禮如儀，並報告開會的意義接着中央宜傳部代表提出兩點要大家注意，「一是要堅定自己對于抗戰必勝的信念，一是加緊自己本身的工作，那就是有錢的要出錢，有力的要出力。」還有國府代表呂參軍　述，「十八個月抗戰的結果，給我們建國作了一個鞏固的基礎，我們在以血肉築成的基礎上，趁了這一年的開始，要下三個决心，一，每個人都要把建國的大業負担起來，二，要盡量發揚總理革命的精神，三，增加今後自己工作的效率。要如此，才能縮短我們取得最後勝利的距離。」（未完）</p>

<p>東西菰嶺　了×變人墳墓</p>
<p>自馬迥嶺我軍撒退後，星子相繼淪入×手，鄱陽湖西岸的戰事重心，就轉移到東西菇嶺了。東西菇嶺在星子與德安之間，×人從這方面進攻的企圓，一是截斷馬迴嶺抵秔部隊的退路，一是謀與馬迴嶺的×軍，兩路夾擊德安，惟我軍事當局，早已洞悉×人狡計，經飭令葉伯芹將軍，拒×於東西菇嶺與金輪峯間地區，使×不得寸進。</p>
<p>九月七日，星子×一聯隊菇嶺我軍陣地，變方展開劇烈血戰，斃×無算，不料×攻東老羞成怒，子翌晨拂曉，施用大量毒氣，我軍受此重大打擊後，爲避免無謂犧牲計，卽由東菇嶺退守至西菇嶺。</p>
<p>西　嶺的地勢，較東菇嶺約低二百米。×人佔領東菇嶺後，不時予我重大威脅，但我忠勇將士，前仆後權，視死如歸，文持了十二日的時閒，殱滅×人兩聯隊，我軍以任務完成，始轉移新陳地。</p>
<p>從東西菇嶺轉進隘口以後，×迭次增援，並挾其優越的武器來犯，我與×輾轉激戰於山家山，歸宗寺，金林街，胡思咀　昭賢冠，榮家山前，胡莊，金龍庵，金輸峯等陣地，其中心尤以金輸峯一役，爲最激烈，在九月廿七日的一天。×集中主力犯我金輸峯北端上的一角尖，但該地距海約「千尺，×人向此前進，必須逐步攀登，而我軍匿伏四周，伺×抵步後，卽以槍砲猛烈轟擊，並向×退路，構成密集火繼，此時×人進退失據，只見×兵個個應聲而倒　儼如西風落葉，三角尖就變成爲×人的屍塚，隘口我軍陣地經過半個月來的抵抗，以其失去軍事上的價值，沒有死守的必要，於是在十月九日我軍自動向後撤退。</p>
<p>瑞武綫上　偉大的殲滅戰</p>
<p>自水街萬家嶺兩地，位於南濤瑞武兩路之間，北起岷山，南迄修河，全部均屬山地，戰事由九月廿五日開始，直至十月十六日而止，其間表演得最驚人的，則爲萬家嶺附近的殲滅戰。</p>
<p>蓋×自八月下旬以瑞武爲據點，卽以一部沿瑞武公路南下，至九月廿五日先頭部隊始進至白水附近，查該×爲一二三及一四五聯隊，山砲五十二聯隊，奉久兵團宮崎富雄聯隊，支那駐屯軍第一第三等聯隊，又有所謂北支派遣軍之一部，總計約有二三萬人。</p>
<p>麒麟峯爲本陣地的鎖鑰，×主力首圖向此進犯，幷施放毒氣，致該陣地兩度失而復得，但×方却傷亡了四個大隊，尤其宮崎聯隊幾全軍覆滅，同時，其他在覆血山，馬鞍山，梨山，灣家凹，何家山等處我軍截擊×人，共斬了兩千首級，所俘獲的軍需品，堆積如山。</p>
<p>×爲援救白水街的危急，以一〇六師團全部，企圖由德安西方之萬家嶺，長嶺，張古山一帶突破我陣地，以一種迂迴的戰法，奪取南昌的前衛德安，再進而殱滅南潯綫上我整個的抗戰力量，以解白水之國，不料爲我方窺破其詭謀，薛岳總司令，卽於前綫召集各高級將領會議，經一畫夜的周密籌劃，將全綫重新部署，分兵數路，團匽地把×酋松浦中將所統率的兩旅團（一爲靑木旅團，一爲山地旅團，共約萬餘人），包圍於萬家領，老虎尖，石馬抗，周家，金村，嗶嘰街等處，此攻彼殺，槍砲聲與殺喊聲震撼山谷，尤以各師所組織的奮勇隊向前衝殺，×更感小支，這時×機雖羣來低飛助戰，並撒毒氣，亦無法挽囘松浦悲慘的敗勢。</p>
<p>這殲滅戰的完成，剛好在去年雙十節的時候，全國各報紙用特號字粒標題德安大掩的消息，便是指此，也可謂不愧稱爲台兒莊第二了。</p>
<p>德安大捷　修河轉移陣地</p>
<p>德安是南潯綫上的一個小城市，自受×機屢次濫炸後，已變成一座一片焦士的死城，街路荒掠，人跡稀罕，來往客人連飯都找不到充饑了。</p>
<p>×人處心積慮，欲奪德安以爲進攻南昌的據點，巳有數月之久，但以我軍在馬迴嶺等處抵抗得力，迭予×人重大打擊，故德安的爭奪戰，至十月廿四日才開始，據情報所得，×之進攻部隊，爲一〇一師團一放團，以及一〇六師團松浦的殘部。</p>
<p>廿四日×在德安之北，屢次飛機大砲協同步兵強行渡河，均被我軍痛擊潰退，×於無可奈何之餘，乃大用毒瓦斯攻擊，使我守河部隊，突然失去抵抗力量，遂乘隙衛過，我與×當卽在熊莊，心佛寺，擬獅崖，老虎山，儀封山一帶展開激烈血戰，×棄屍棄械，滿山載道，但我方犧牲亦屬不少，團長柴敬忠，及營長兩三人也壯烈殉國</p>
<p>德安城由由七日至卅日連日展開巷戰，因×軍以飛機大砲助戰，幷放毒氣烟幕，故得以屢次衝入城內，但均被我軍像殺鼠般的驅除出去。全體將士，抱着與城共存亡的宗旨，非不得已决不輕於放棄一寸土地，而且必須索得×人很大的代價。一天，我軍引誘×兵數十，竄入大屋內，同時在隔璧與屋頂的空隙處。猛以手　彈數十擲下，祇聞一陣爆炸聲，繼着一陣呼喊聲，×兵一個一個倒在血泊中，我軍乘勢衝出，又斬×百餘。</p>
<p>本來德安是可以增援保衛的，惟以戰略關係，且武漢廣州已相繼失陷，死守一個滿城焦土的小德安，於軍事上無大補益，便於三，日奉命　條河轉進，我軍在修河之南，與×隔岸對持，染成縱深的陣地，鋼鉄一般的保衛着南昌。（十二月廿七日寄）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Urgent Task of Expanding the Dramatic Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Chun</p>
<p>Amidst the escalating aggression of Japanese fascism, everything in China is developing and growing within the anti-aggression movement. The newly emerging dramatic movement is also developing and growing within this anti-aggression national liberation movement. Beginning in 1930, with the deepening of the national crisis brought about by the "September 18th Incident," the "January 28th Incident," and so on, the dramatic movement increasingly took on a combative stance, assisting in the development of the national liberation movement. After the full-scale War of Resistance began on "August 13th," driven by the fervor of national salvation, dramatic activists armed themselves with theater, forming a vast iron army of dramatic combat teams. Under the rapid transformation of content and form, they closely coordinated with the needs of the War of Resistance, bravely shouldering the great tasks of the new era!</p>
<p>Hong Kong, this secluded paradise, requires us to awaken its more than one hundred thousand compatriots, many of whom are living in a drunken stupor, and to raise their patriotic fervor for national salvation. Drama is, of course, a very important central task, the most ingenious and suitable propaganda tool in this unique environment. Over the past year, through the efforts of various parties, Hong Kong's spoken drama movement has gradually become active from a state of silence that was almost suffocating, establishing a considerable foundation. Now, the central issue is how to promote and expand this work, how to expand and consolidate this foundation, so that it can manifest itself in the most suitable and highest degree of effectiveness, break through the shackles of this special environment, which is cloaked in the guise of a capitalist society but harbors deep-seated feudal remnants, and establish a genuine drama for national salvation!</p>
<p>Of course, in this unique environment, launching any progressive cultural movement is a difficult and arduous task, especially for the newly emerging spoken drama. Because it lacks the lively interest of traditional opera, which has a long history, and the magnificence of grand foreign films, not to mention the magical sensuality and authoritative appeal of Cantonese films. Thus, in this cultural desert, it can only circulate among a small segment of the higher cultural strata, unable to win over a broader audience, especially due to economic and other various reasons, making it impossible to have frequent performance opportunities, and failing to meet objective requirements in terms of both quality and quantity. This is certainly due to the extraordinary difficulties of the objective environment, but the biggest reason lies in the weakness of subjective forces and insufficient effort. This future is fraught with hidden dangers!</p>
<p>Now, we have entered an even more arduous and greater stage of the War of Resistance. The enemy's artillery fire is pressing even closer to our side. We must intensify our efforts to mobilize and educate the countless compatriots here and those who have fled from various places, and step up efforts to contribute their strength to the motherland in distress, to strive for the freedom and liberation of the entire nation. Therefore, for the most subtle and effective propaganda tool with the greatest political influence and appeal—spoken drama—we must intensify our efforts to correct past weaknesses and mistakes, strive to overcome the difficulties and blows of the objective environment, and actively launch our urgent tasks, producing good "countermeasures" in a planned and step-by-step manner. Here, I would like to offer a few relatively important opinions, based on my observations in Hong Kong's drama movement circle over the past year, with the utmost sincerity, for the joint efforts of drama comrades:</p>
<p>First, Establish a Dramatic Theory – We must quickly establish a sound and correct theory of national salvation drama to overcome the difficulties of the objective environment and the weaknesses of the subjective, correct the erroneous and dismissive views of the society in the past, make them understand the artistic status and power of the drama and the contribution to the national salvation movement, and arouse their broad sympathy and help to the dramatic movement. On the one hand, strengthen the education of the drama workers themselves, instruct and discuss the lines of all work and the use of technology, in order to cultivate their own strength. We hope that the leaders of the cultural and drama circles and the drama workers themselves will regularly write and publish theories and criticisms of national salvation drama, and establish and expand this movement!</p>
<p>Second, Strengthen the United Front – Only unity has strength, and only under a large and unified organizational system can the highest efficiency of work be produced. This is the highest principle of all work, and drama is certainly no exception. Hong Kong drama, which is just budding, is most lacking in this important basic work. In the past, because of inconsistent steps, unscientific division of labor, and inability to match the advantages of the people to make up for each other's shortcomings - the inability to break the boundaries between various groups and the disadvantages of each governing their own affairs as much as possible, I do not know how much objective obstacles have increased and how much subjective force has decreased. Although the "Hong Kong Drama Association" had once actively prepared for organization in August and September last year, the result was lost, which is a pity; Although the "Hong Kong Kowloon Youth Drama Association" has recently been established with the efforts of several small theater companies, the waiting is still small, and those with more powerful theater companies have not participated, which is also not perfect. In the future, in order to seek the development of work and enhance our own strength, we must quickly establish a center with close contact, and use the spirit of collective habit and collective criticism to improve our own education, on the one hand, and use collective action to concentrate the effectiveness of the work - whether it is a dramatist and a dramatist, or a drama and a theater troupe, and further to various departments in the cultural field, they should all unite under the banner of the national united front to exert the great power of the collective!</p>
<p>Third, Improve Artistic Standards – Now, although we are not in a time of art for art's sake, art is always art; we use drama to promote doctrine and express ideas, precisely because it has a unique artistic power. Therefore, whether it is anti-feudalism, anti-×, or praising the War of Resistance, we must skillfully and skillfully use artistic forms in order to express the correct content as much as possible, and win the love and belief of a large number of audiences. Therefore, the various departments of drama, such as script, rehearsal, decoration, lighting, sound, and the actor's acting skills, etc., should be given great attention and improvement. Even if due to economic constraints, we must use brainpower and spirit to fill this deficiency, and try to make the content of each work full, so that each role has pure blood and excellent acting skills, and each device is realistic and beautified. Severely abandon the past rough and hasty pit-playing doctrine, and seriously make this budding drama a sound and powerful art, sweep away the past social people's contempt for it, and fully and correctly give play to its positive effectiveness!</p>
<p>Fourth, Practice the Popularization of Drama – The formal staging of Hong Kong spoken drama and the attempt to professionalize drama is a recent progressive stage. However, because of the concentration of power in the performance of multi-act long plays, I am afraid that the performance of mass plays and one-act plays will be ignored, the function of going deep into the masses will be ignored, and the crisis of going into the first doctrine of business will be ignored. Now, because of the difficulty of renting theaters and the current needs of the masses, in order to expand the influence of the national salvation drama movement, we should not only perform large plays, but also small plays, and do not forget to look for schools that can be performed to the public theaters or public places. We must eradicate the error of art-firstism, and work hard to demand new forms and small-scale regular performances that suit the taste of the masses, in order to win a wide range of mass audiences.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a very serious problem, that is, every drama worker, in addition to humbly striving for the study of general stage art and the coping of performance affairs, should also strive to learn the theory and practice of national salvation, and should not simply be art for art's sake, but should temper himself into a fighter for the liberation of the people. Seriously arm your thoughts, strictly organize your life, correctly recognize the positive line of the drama movement and the urgent tasks at hand, and strive for the absolute seriousness of the play with a faithful attitude and a fighting posture, and truly dedicate the drama to the motherland in hard struggle; To overcome all the difficulties of the objective environment by fighting through the unremitting spirit of collective learning and work. Bravely shoulder the arduous mission entrusted by the times - only in this way can this art approach the ideal development and growth!</p>
<p>Comrades! Keep working hard and fighting hard for the future of the national salvation drama movement and for this sacred and great national liberation struggle!</p>
<h3 id="e2">In the Past Year: The Active Hong Kong Drama Movement <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Chu</p>
<p>A Review of the Past Year</p>
<p>The Hong Kong drama movement has a history of seven years. From its beginning until a year ago, it roughly went through two stages. The second stage began around 1932, spreading from mainland China to Hong Kong. However, its scope of activity was very narrow, limited to cultural circles, and its performance capabilities were also very weak. Apart from appearing in cultural organizations' entertainment events, there were no opportunities at all. This period of theater was "for the sake of drama," and could also be said to be a movement to establish the foundations of dramatic art.</p>
<p>This period of the drama movement lasted a long time, until the July 7th Incident occurred, and then there was a big change. At this time, the drama movement in the mainland had already begun following the national salvation movement. The drama movement in Hong Kong could not stand still either. So, on the one hand, it inherited the existing skills and made more progressive explorations; on the other hand, it added new content, and when these were combined, it became a more complete drama. The most notable expression of this work was the "China Art Association Drama Research Society," which, shortly after the "July 7th" Incident, performed "Protecting Lugouqiao" and "Thunderstorm" at the "Ko Sing Theatre." Although the performance results were not very successful, the high level of audience emotion was unprecedented.</p>
<p>What I have said above is the general situation of the Hong Kong drama movement a year ago. It can be said to be the precursor to the later drama movement, because the later drama movement developed along the previous line. In the year or so since then, the general drama movement workers have not only been people who are "for the sake of drama," but also brave warriors who are fighting for the independence and liberation of the country and the nation. The drama movement is not only developing on its own, but also a national salvation movement.</p>
<p>The Drama Movement is Developing</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, the Hong Kong drama movement has been gradually developing. Here, we must first mention the efforts of the Drama Group of the Chinese Arts Advancement Association. The Association is a general organization for Hong Kong youth cultural workers, and the Drama Group is just one of its departments. The initial talents of the group can be said to include the middle and main figures of the Hong Kong drama scene. After the outbreak of the July 7th War of Resistance, they once publicly performed national defense dramas such as "Wu Gui Bridge," "The Sack Team," and "Black Hell" on a large scale at the Po Hing Theatre in Kowloon in the name of disaster relief. The South China Drama Research Society was also organized by some of their main members in cooperation with Guangzhou drama comrades. In the second phase, which is the first half of this year, because of the special difficulties of the objective environment, they had to change the positional warfare to guerrilla warfare, and try to find performance opportunities as much as possible, and move the spoken drama to schools, to the Yau Ma Tei, and several times to the docks, and to the neighboring small villages. Later, the Shanghai Customs National Salvation Long March Troupe and the Shanghai August 13th Chorus came to Hong Kong. Because of the needs of the objective environment, they joined forces. On May 8th of this year, they publicly performed the national defense drama "The Storm on the Frontier" at the Yau Lok Theatre to raise funds for the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association to comfort the soldiers in front. The success was quite good; at the same time, because of the effective publicity, the entire drama scene was stirred up a huge wave - soon on May 24th and 19th, they combined to publicly perform "The Storm on the Frontier" and "Blood Spattered on a Sunny Sky" at the Taiping Theatre and the Central Theatre one after another, so the Hong Kong drama scene was stimulated to commotion. - and the formal rise of Hong Kong National Defense Drama can also be said to be the arrow of this.</p>
<p>At this time, the Hong Kong school drama movement also showed an abnormally vigorous attitude. The "July 7th Drama Society" of South China Middle School can be said to be the most diligent member. Later, it staged more than ten plays, such as "Spring Breeze Autumn Moon," "Flying General," "Protecting Lugouqiao," and other one-act plays. During the wanderings, it appeared the most in front of the audience in Hong Kong, and, during the spring vacation, it once promoted in the four rural areas, because it made the Hong Kong school drama movement and the other small theater companies gradually rise up, and later, they felt that it was not enough to perform in the theater alone. In order to truly cooperate with the national salvation movement, at the end of the first half of 1938, they heroically returned to the mainland to participate in a more difficult and more meaningful work.</p>
<p>A Sudden Rise in Professional Theatre Companies</p>
<p>At about the same time, the "Era Theatre Company," which suddenly rose up, was produced. It was organized by a part of the main figures of the past Union Association Drama Group (that is, a group of comrades from the China Drama Research Society) and the previous actors from Hong Kong and Guangzhou. It appeared in the posture of a professional theatre company, ready to make a long fight. After its establishment, it immediately set a plan for regular performances, performing once every week, hoping to make long-term regular performances. After a lot of effort, the performances went on one after another. The plays performed include "The Eve," "The Roar of Chamcheng," "The Luminous Cup," and "The Paint is Not Dry." The box office results were quite good. On the anniversary of "September 18th," "The Roar of the Ancient City" was re-performed, and all the proceeds were donated to relieve refugees. On November 7th and 8th, "Thunderstorm" and "The Paint is Not Dry" were performed at the "Po Hing Theatre" to raise funds for the Women's War Relief Association to relieve refugees. Their efforts aroused great sympathy from the society, especially the news media gave a lot of help. Now, under the guidance of Ouyang Yuqian, they are stepping up the rehearsal of new plays, preparing to go to Macau in the near future for a large-scale performance!</p>
<p>The Arrival and Dissolution of the China Travel Theatre in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The China Travel Theatre also arrived in Hong Kong in July. The "China Travel Theatre" is a famous theatre company in the mainland. The organization of the performances, the richness of the experience, and the purity of the stage technology really gave the public a new feeling. After arriving in Hong Kong, it did give the Hong Kong drama scene a great stimulus. They performed many plays: "Spring Breeze and Rain," "Thunderstorm," "The Luminous Cup," "The True Story of Ah Q," "The Death of Li Xiucheng," "Sunrise," etc. They have made a great contribution to the Hong Kong drama movement.</p>
<p>However, the professional spoken drama groups have a great crisis lurking. Because of the imperfections in the internal organization, the laxness of the economic structure, the inequality in the treatment of the members, and the unclear line of work, the "China Travel Theatre" was manipulated by one or two people, resulting in many malpractices, and unfortunately, it was dissolved on November 24th!</p>
<p>After the dissolution of China Travel Theatre, most of the members still held the determination to work for the sake of drama, and another Chinese Art Theatre Company was established on October 26th. With the help of Ouyang Yuqian, they had performed "Song of Righteousness." Now, they are actively rehearsing "A New Official Takes Office" and "The Inspector," preparing for a large-scale performance.</p>
<p>In addition to the Customs Long March Troupe, the August 13th Chorus, and the China Travel Theatre, there are many other foreign theatre companies: such as the China Puppet Theatre Company, which performed "The Pigeon Girl," "The Luminous Xuan," "Blood Spattered in the Sky" here; The Masses Theatre Company, which performed "The Luminous Cup" and</p>
<p>A scene from the Era Theatre Company's performance of "The Night Before." "Mount Tai and Goose Feather"; The National Theatre Company, which performed "The Storm on the Yangtze River"; and the Xiamen Children's Theatre Company, which went abroad and passed through Hong Kong, performing "Who is Our Father" and "Little Hero." Recently, there is also an Art Flower Theatre Company, which interspersed with thigh-style singing and dancing, and performed "Blood Spattered in the Sky." These theatre companies are all foreign or combined with local theatre people to form an organization, and they perform in Mandarin. Although the results are all ordinary, they do stimulate the theatre movement here.</p>
<p>The Active Lower-Level Theatre Movement</p>
<p>In addition, the performances lurking in the lower-level small theatres and various school organizations have also been very impressive in the past year. Among them, the most hardworking is the Sheng Society Performing Troupe, which has performed "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain" and "The Night Before." The Drama Group of the Student Relief Association has performed plays such as "General Zhang." The rest are the Progressive Theatre Company, the Drama Group of Zhenguang Girls' Middle School, the Drama Group of China Bookstore, the Theatre Company of the Youth Association, the Ant Music Children's Theatre Company, the Ding Chou Theatre Company, the Drama Group of the Yixun Training Class, the Drama Society of the Huiyang Youth Association, the Modern Theatre Company, the Stubborn Struggle Theatre Company, the August 13th Theatre Company, the Bee Theatre Company, the New Star Society, the Self-Improvement Society, etc., all have had a lot of work performance. More than a month ago, several small theatre companies in Kowloon grandly held a "Joint Grand Performance of Major Theatre Companies in Kowloon," performing many one-act plays. Recently,</p>
<p>A scene from the China Travel Theatre's performance of "The Death of Li Xiucheng." They further organized a "Hong Kong Youth Theatre Association," which was officially established on New Year's Eve last month. In the future, this aspect of work will certainly have a better development.</p>
<p>Some Opinions and Prospects</p>
<p>In summary, the Hong Kong theatre scene in the past year has been quite active and lively. In terms of quantity, there have been more than 100 performances, almost two or three performances every star. In terms of quality, almost all of the creative plays in recent years have been performed. There are various types of performances: one is for public propaganda in the four corners of the world, one is the Ai Mei performance of cultural groups: one is the disaster relief drama, and the other is professionalization. Of course, there are also common goals among them, that is, the mission that Ai Wei should bear to the times and to the nation.</p>
<p>In the theatre's own movement, there are also very obvious characteristics. The former interest-based theatre performance has now become a thing of the past. Although Ai Mei still exists, it is not so much Ai Mei in theatre as it is loving the motherland and loving the nation. Professionalized theatre organizations have also been produced. Although they are not yet mature, they have indeed taken the first step towards professionalization. Due to the progress of stage technology and the increase of the audience, it can be determined that the time distance from the real professionalization period is not far, in other words, it has already embarked on the path of gradual maturity.</p>
<p>No one can make an accurate prediction of what the state of the theatre movement in the coming year will be, but with the foundation completed in the past year, the achievements can certainly be estimated. I hope that the theatre workers here can recognize the correct goal, improve the level of art, and work harder and more painstakingly to overcome subjective weaknesses and objective difficulties, and push this year's theatre movement in Hong Kong a step further!</p>
<p>Editor's note: In this issue, there is a very detailed "Statistical Table of Hong Kong Theatre Performances in 1938" by Mr. Zhu Baishui, which gives us a powerful reference. Unfortunately, due to space limitations, it could not be published, and we have to keep it for the next issue. We would like to express our apologies to the author and readers for this!</p>
<h3 id="e3">Hong Kong Film Industry in the Past Year (Continued) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Dun</p>
<p>What we must first clarify is whether those so-called national defense films that do not sell are genuine national defense films. On this point, we cannot help but be skeptical about the many so-called national defense films in the past: First, many so-called national defense films in the past were either monotonous and formulaic in terms of themes and stories, or too idealistic; Secondly, the techniques were incomplete. Because the stories were too exaggerated and idealistic, and were too far away from the lives of the audience, they were not understood by the audience and did not generate empathy. Also, because the stories were formulaic, the audience felt that they were dull and boring, and they could not arouse interest. Therefore, these so-called national defense films lost the trust of the audience, so how could they be effective?</p>
<p>Because the general naive national defense films lost the trust of the audience, the low-level folk story films, erotic films... naturally became very popular. This is a very simple principle.</p>
<p>So, the focus of the problem is: national defense films are not unable to sell. The reason why this phenomenon has occurred in the past is simply because the so-called national defense films in the past were naive and incompetent.</p>
<p>The complete realization of the beneficial nature of weapon art cannot be achieved by simple slogans, but must be conveyed with the best technology and the most artistic means.</p>
<p>The question then develops, saying that the reason why current folk stories, pornography, and other toxic films sell is only a temporary phenomenon. It is only because the national defense films in the past were naive and lost the trust of the audience, and at the same time, because there is a lack of real national defense films.</p>
<p>Cantonese film audiences are mostly lower-level masses, and this class of people are most concerned about and enthusiastic about the motherland. The unprecedented enthusiasm of the Hong Kong hawker relief movement in the past can be taken as evidence, and because of this proof, it can be determined that national defense films are not what the audience does not want to see. On the contrary, the general audience is thirsting for real national defense films – the emergence of excellent and well-deserved national defense films!</p>
<p>Another year has passed, and the sacred national self-defense war has entered a new stage. Similarly, we also hope that our film industry will enter a new stage. We must overcome the weaknesses of the past, liquidate the mistakes of the past, and strive to sweep away all the rotten things, re-establish the credibility of national defense films, stand firm in our posts, and shoulder the tasks that we must bear during the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>The dawn of final victory has already appeared in front of us, and a real and perfect national defense film should also appear! (End)</p>

<p>The "Toyo Tobacco Company" was established in Tokyo in the eighth year of the Taisho era, receiving special permission from the Japanese government to engage in the import and export trade of Japanese tobacco leaves, and handling the export business of the Japanese Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. It also directly manages the manufacturing of cigarettes, and its capital has now increased to 10 million yen, in order to strengthen its entry into the Chinese tobacco market.</p>
<p>The company established a branch in Shanghai early on, and its tasks were limited to collecting and purchasing Chinese-produced tobacco leaves, and promoting its cigarettes. At first, it did not directly engage in manufacturing, but now it has leased two Chinese-owned tobacco factories and one Chinese-owned printing factory in the guerrilla zone, and is engaged in establishing three cigarette manufacturing plants. The first and second plants have already started production, and it is reported that the production capacity reaches 3.3 billion to 4 billion cigarettes per year. The third cigarette factory, converted from a printing factory, was largely completed in mid-October and is scheduled to officially start production this month.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Seizing Shanghai's Water and Electricity</p>
<p>The Japanese are even more deliberately trying to seize the water business, which is the mother of industry and commerce and essential for daily life, constantly making propaganda in certain parties and their instigators' Chinese-Japanese newspapers, inducing "cooperation." If they don't get their way, they threaten with "confiscation." If "confiscation" doesn't work, they demand "registration." However, Chinese water and electricity businesses are as firm as a rock and remain unmoved. Recently, it was heard that the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company was pondering a way, and on the 24th, it blew its own trumpet and unilaterally held a shareholders' meeting, while also threatening to completely take over the water and electricity companies on January 1st. In fact, these water and electricity companies have long been garrisoned by certain parties' troops, and have been roughly repaired by the Japanese to barely function. According to the reports of various Japanese newspapers, the so-called Huazhong Water and Electricity Joint Stock Company was first established by the Japanese to make Chinese businesses "cooperate." Nominally, the authorized capital is 25 million Japanese yen, with the Japanese contributing 10 million yen in cash, and various Chinese water and electricity plants contributing 15 million yen in kind (this is also a Japanese term, borrowing the Chinese expression of using productive assets as equity). The Japanese 10 million yen cash contribution is made by the Central China Revitalization Enterprise Company contributing 7.5 million yen, and the Central China Electricity Industry Association contributing 2.5 million yen. The in-kind contribution from the Chinese water and electricity plant side is estimated and determined by the Japanese, as follows (unit: thousands of Japanese yen):</p>

<p>Huashang Electric Company 3,800</p>
<p>Inland Tap Water Company 2,553</p>
<p>Pudong Electric Company 800</p>
<p>Pudong Tap Water Company 45</p>
<p>Xianghua Electric Company 70</p>
<p>Zhenru Electric Company 18</p>
<p>Among them, the assets of the tap water side are estimated by the Japanese as 6 million yen of equity, and the electricity side as 9 million yen. Regardless of whether this estimate is true or false, the total assets of the two Guanbei Chinese companies alone are worth 50 million national currency, while the Japanese estimate only 11 million. It would be more straightforward to say "what's yours is mine," which would not lose the original intent. The president of the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company is Aoki Sekimon, and the president is Kimura Heiemon. The only one who colludes with him is a certain party and the so-called Water and Electricity Business Integration Committee, which is originally its government-sponsored agency.</p>
<p>After the Huajun withdrew from Nanshi and Zhabei, they adhered to the scorched earth policy. After being burned by a certain army for more than ten days, the essence was burned to ashes. The damage to the Zhabei water and electricity plant was relatively minor, but the machinery and components of the Huashang Electric Plant were also lost. The Japanese had already been generating water and electricity in these plants, but now the residents of Nanshi and Zhabei are helpless, poor, and struggling to survive. Water is indispensable, while electricity can be saved, so there are few users. The Huazhong Water and Electricity Company, located at the original site of the Areli Water and Electricity Company on North Sichuan Road in Zhabei, and at the Shanghai Bank branch on Ximen in Nanshi, sends people to persuade households to use electricity and collect deposits. Initially, there was still coal stored in the plants to burn, but recently the coal has been burned out, expenses are increasing daily, and losses are unsustainable. The threat of confiscation has arisen again. However, Chinese businesses see through this situation, understand the big picture, understand the principles, and remain consistent, refusing to be subdued.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Heavy Casualties in Huibo Danjian Disasters Over 300,000 Refugees Awaiting Relief After Robbery The Villages and Towns Along the Huidan Road Have Been Turned into Scorched Earth Compatriots in Distress are Displaced, Hungry, and Cold <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>With the outbreak of the Southern War, Huiyang was the first to be ravaged by the * cavalry. Wherever they went, houses were turned into ruins. In the occupied areas, there were refugees everywhere, displaced and suffering unprecedentedly cruel disasters. At the moment, major towns such as Danshui, Huizhou, and Boluo have been successively recovered. After the robbery, the refugees are crying out for relief, reaching more than 200,000 people. The local government is busy handling local post-disaster affairs and relief work, relying on the support of philanthropists and relief organizations. The Overseas Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce Refugee Relief Committee quickly planned relief efforts at the beginning of the recovery of Huiyang, decided on a relief plan, and first allocated 35,000 yuan to purchase materials for relief. Relief workers carried them to various towns and villages in the war zone to conduct on-site investigations and provide emergency relief. Fourteen relief stations have been established in Huiyang Dong* Shian counties. Yesterday, reports were received from Huizhou Bo Nan, Danshui Yazi Village, and other stations on the relief work, and the investigation of the disaster situation along the Huidan Highway was very detailed. The Huiyang Relief Committee is now carrying out relief efforts based on the report, and the disaster situation in Huibo is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Houses Turned into Ruins in Danhui Area</p>
<p>A total of 702 houses were burned and bombed in Danshui City and nearby villages. About a hundred people were killed by bombings in the city and outside the market. Several hundred people died from starvation and illness while fleeing. About three thousand people are displaced and homeless. At the beginning of the relief work, due to the lack of all materials after the robbery, iron pots, stoves, and all utensils were inconvenient. Therefore, only rice is provided daily for the refugees to cook. The disaster situation in the villages and towns along the Danhui Highway is very serious. Villages such as the Fushan, Tonghe, Zhenlong, and Yazi Village markets have become a scorched earth. Stores and refugees have been burned. There are so many refugees that they cannot be counted. The New Market Pig Trade Street and other places have been burned, totaling 539 houses. The disaster situation in Yazi Village is particularly serious. Refugees are everywhere, and the number is still being investigated. Emergency relief is being carried out first, and the sick are being rescued. In the affected areas, 1,000 houses were burned in Pingle South. More than 130 houses were burned in Pingle North. More than 270 houses in Ganghe Township. More than 490 houses in Zhenlong Township. About 100 houses in Zhong* Village Market. About 80 houses in Zhenlong Market. About 30 houses in Puzai Market. About 40 houses in Liansheng Market. A total of about 3,000 houses.</p>
<p>80% of Huizhou City Stores Burned</p>
<p>Huizhou City is an important military location, so it suffered the most. Before it fell, it had been bombed by * aircraft, and nearly half of the city's businesses had been bombed. After the occupation, * people set fire to it. The stores on Shuidong Street in the county town have been burned to 80%. Half of the stores on Wanshi Lane and Dashi Street in the prefectural city have been burned. Residences in the attached city, such as Shangxia Tangxia and Shaibu Ground, have all been burned. Dongxin and Tieqiang, which connect the prefectural city and the county town, have been destroyed by bombing when the * army withdrew. In addition, many villages near Huizhou City have been looted. There are currently about 4,000 refugees in the entire city. The Huiyang Chamber of Commerce provides porridge at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, twice a day. Due to the large number of people, the food supply is extremely problematic. Currently, refugees are scattered throughout the city, and the resettlement problem has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Boluo is the Most Miserable, Nine Out of Ten Empty</p>
<p>The location of Boluo is as important as Huizhou. The disaster situation is even worse than Huizhou. The stores in the county town have been almost completely burned. Nine out of ten businesses are empty. More than half of the civilian houses have been destroyed by bombing. The population has scattered in all directions. Although it has been recovered, very few people have returned. The resumption of business is even rarer. The county magistrate has returned to the county to preside over post-disaster work. Although the * army has withdrawn, * aircraft still fly over the territory from time to time to spy. In terms of transportation, only the wooden boats between Huizhou and Boluo have resumed traffic. Among the disaster areas in the attached city, Paiwei Ying, Qi* Lake, Lianan, Zhonglu, Tang, Xiangshui, Lianan, Tianpai, Yihe, Xinzhaotang, Biaohua, Guanghe, Guoshi, Futian, Lianhe, Shuibei, and other places are the most tragic. In the above-mentioned areas, there are an estimated 130,000 to 150,000 refugees, urgently awaiting relief.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Hong Kong Becomes the General Station for National Tea Exports 600,000 Boxes Shipped Last Year Valued at Over 25 Million Yuan <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>National tea is one of China's special products, and its foreign trade is very large. Shanghai has always been the general export station, with sales to the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, and other countries. Since the war of resistance, tea areas in eastern China have been ravaged by * people, which has greatly affected exports. According to a reporter's investigation, the general export station for national tea has been moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Before the fall of Guangzhou, all tea from central China, such as Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, was transported to Hong Kong via the Yuehan Railway, and then shipped for export. Since the fall of Guangzhou, this railway transport has been interrupted. It is understood that national tea is now mostly transported from various provinces in the mainland to **, from ** to **, via Hanoi to Hong Kong, or from Guangxi to Guangdong to Guangzhou Bay to Hong Kong, whichever is convenient. In addition, there are many exports from Yunnan via * Guang. According to reports, the output of national tea has not decreased in the past year. 599,030 boxes were transported from the mainland to Hong Kong for transshipment and export, valued at over 25 million yuan. At present, a large quantity of national tea from various provinces in central China is still being shipped to Hong Kong. In the past year, Pingshui green tea accounted for the largest proportion of tea exported, about 250,000 boxes, while in previous years it was only 200,000 boxes. There is also a lot of Qining black tea, about 120,000 boxes in about twelve months, while in previous years it was only 70,000 to 80,000 boxes. Last year, national tea was mostly shipped to Russia, the United States, and * other places, all breaking previous records. It is expected that this year's export volume will also increase. Hong Kong has now become the only export station for national tea.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong and Kowloon Resident's Association hosted the Hong Kong press at the St. Francis Hotel at 2:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Liao Bingquan reported on the association's preparation process and the general idea of its work: (1) The residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon total more than one million, and businesses and residents account for 97%. However, the general landlords take advantage of the increase in Hong Kong residents and the superficial prosperity of the market to take the opportunity to raise rents, which makes residents uneasy and affects social order and tranquility. It is necessary to form a group to protect the interests of residents. (2) The government's regulations to protect residents are about to expire. The association will request the government to continue its effectiveness. Also, since businesses are not protected, it will also petition the government to enact regulations to protect them.</p>

<p>Several years ago, the Hong Kong government implemented currency control, following China's nationalization of silver policy. At the same time, in order to stabilize exchange rates, it sold the collected silver and established a foreign exchange fund, and appointed Qi Libin, general manager of Shanghai Bank, etc., to organize a foreign exchange fund committee to be responsible for it. According to the Gazette published yesterday, the Hong Kong government's foreign exchange fund assets increased to 13,012,871 in the first half of the year. On December 31, 1937, it was 12,313,938 pounds, an increase of approximately 700,000 pounds. As for the debt amount in the first half of the year, it was 191,034,887 yuan, converted at the exchange rate in mid-June last year (each yuan is equal to one shilling, two pence, and thirty-one thirty-seconds), equivalent to 11,914,166 pounds. On November 30, 1937, it was 11,394,969 pounds.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 refugees scattered throughout the New Territories have been relocated to Shenzhen by the Relief Federation and rescue teams for centralized relief. For ten days, the refugees in Xia Village, Shangbing, Wenjin, Shatoujiao, and other places in the border area have been relocated, totaling more than 3,000 people. Today, the refugees in Ping Shan Station will be relocated, followed by the refugees in Yuen Long Station, etc. It has been decided that all will be relocated within a few days. The barracks in Shenzhen have been completed one after another. In addition to accommodating the refugees in the New Territories as much as possible, there is still room to accommodate others who come voluntarily. However, the refugees who have not yet been relocated are in a miserable situation in this cold weather and urgently need relief. There are still 5,000 refugees who have not yet been relocated to Shenzhen, mostly women and children. A week or two ago, most of them were still sleeping in the wilderness, with nothing to protect them from the wind and rain. Fortunately, during this week, the refugees also knew that in this winter season, the wind and rain are unpredictable, and they have each built small thatched huts to provide temporary shelter. In these one or two days of snow and rain, the refugees can finally have a place to live.</p>

<p>Councilor Tao Xingzhi has inspected various battle lines and met with various commanders in the past few months. Recently, he went to Guangxi for inspection. He was deeply impressed by the anti-Japanese spirit of the people of Guangxi, especially the training of the strong and the enthusiasm for joining the service. Recently, he came to Hong Kong from Guangxi and gave a speech to a reporter from this newspaper. Tao attended a certain emergency meeting that night to report on the observations on various lines. According to the speech, Guangxi's mobilization achievements are very significant. If Guangxi is taken as the standard, China can immediately mobilize 14 million people. With such a large force, coupled with appropriate training, it is more than enough to deal with the * people in wartime. Tao expressed great optimism about the future of the war of resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Four Fishing Boats Off the Coast of Hong Kong and Off the Coast of Dotou Were Burned and Robbed by * Fishermen Were Beaten and Lost More Than 10,000 Yuan <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>* Warships have repeatedly burned and robbed fishing boats outside the port, which is extremely rampant and happens almost every day. Yesterday, four more fishing boats were burned and robbed outside the port, losing more than 10,000 yuan in property. Fortunately, the boat owners and others survived and returned to Hong Kong to report to the Fishermen's Progressive Association. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Two Boats Robbed and Then Burned</p>
<p>Boat owner Zheng Caishun of boat number 161HM and Zhou Lai, the owner of another boat whose number is unknown, both registered in Hong Kong. Zheng set sail from * Jiwan on December 24 last year to fish. Zhou Lai set sail on the 26th of last month. The two trawlers sailed to the side of Luwan Mountain off the coast of Macau to fish. Just as they were working, they saw a * warship in the distance coming towards them. They tried to escape, but the * warship accelerated. The two fishing boats could not escape and were caught by the * warship. The * warship was angry that they had escaped. When they caught up, they first threatened them and beat them. Then they drove the people into a small boat, looted them, and searched the boats empty. They burned the two trawlers and left. After they saw the * soldiers leave, their expressions calmed down slightly. They paddled back to the boat but could not put out the fire. Fortunately, it was not completely destroyed. They towed the boat back to Hong Kong. Each boat lost about 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Two Fresh Trawlers Robbed of Property</p>
<p>Another two fresh trawlers, one owned by Zhou Deshi and the other by Zhou Deren, set sail from Hong Kong on December 21 last year to fish. They sailed to the sea off the west coast of Pinghai in Huiyang, Doutou. Just as they were fishing, a * warship suddenly came towards them at lightning speed. They first threatened them, forbidding them to make a sound, and ordered them to hand over the property on the boat. Even the women's slippers were robbed. After the * soldiers put all the property on the * warship, they shouted and left. Before leaving, they told them not to report to the police station when they returned to Hong Kong. The property robbed was about 700 yuan. They returned to Hong Kong yesterday and reported to the Fishermen's Progressive Association.</p>

<p>During this national crisis, compatriots from various places have come to Hong Kong one after another. For a time, they are unfamiliar with the place and urgently need relief. The student department of the Hong Kong YMCA has united various teachers, schools, and groups to organize a student relief association.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned that Xu Shiying has come to assist the association, stating that regarding the matter of the subsidy, the association will obey the order and specially allocate a subsidy of 20,000 national currency for relief. The attached letter has been sent to Chongqing by airmail. Once the funds arrive, they will be notified. The association's office is located in the YMCA, and many people have been going to the association to register in recent days.</p>

<p>Since its launch, the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" has been responded to by various overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong. Now, the Five Trades Guilds of Hong Kong's restaurants and tea rooms have decided to send letters to the leaders of the Five Trades within two or three days to discuss the progress. Also, according to Liu Moxi, chairman of the Women's War Disaster Association, the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" has been held by the association for many days. The Women's Christian Association, the Labor Association, and the New Movement Association are all starting to raise funds separately under the banner of the Women's Federation. It is believed that the results in the future will be better than the flag donation on Double Eleven last year. The Chinese Machinery Association plans to hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss the progress after it is planned to be held. The meeting date of the Chaozhou Eight Counties Chamber of Commerce is set for Sunday. The Joint Committee for Disaster Relief of the Christian Church will hold a meeting to discuss and promote the holding of various churches. Also, it is reported that the faculty and students of Guangzhou University and its attached middle school also decided to launch a response to this matter yesterday, and decided to send representatives to contact student groups from various schools in Hong Kong to proceed together, in order to enhance the strength of the war of resistance and achieve final victory.</p>

<p>The Kowloon Chinese Amateur School was founded by Tao Xingzhi, Wu Hanzhen, and other educators who are enthusiastic about social and cultural undertakings in Hong Kong. It has been more than a month since the school opened, and it has achieved good results. Recently, in order to improve the cultural level of overseas Chinese and widely disseminate knowledge, it is planned to establish a public library to serve the community. It is reported that the school has decided to hold a drama and singing fundraising event at the Kowloon Peace Theater at 10:00 am on the 15th of this month. The program is very rich. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically support it. The Hong Kong Amateur Friendship Association has been working hard on the development of cultural services to the community since it was approved by the Hong Kong government to prepare for it, which has been well received by all sectors of society. The number of members has reached more than one hundred. The association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Confucian Temple on Caroline Hill at 1:00 pm this Sunday (the 8th), and Mr. Tao Xingzhi will be invited to give a speech.

<h3 id="e19">Film and Drama <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Entertainment... Soul Adrift on the Edge of the Sea Alglerg</p>
<p>The story is set in a mysterious and strange place, like one described in "Arabian Nights," called Algiers. Although it is now a French territory, part of the city is quite modern, while another part, inhabited by indigenous people, still retains the mysterious colors of ancient Orient. In this place, lawlessness reigns, a gathering place for thieves and outlaws. The director has handled such a setting with utmost gloom and brutality, further highlighting a moving story. The insidious and cruel actions of the bandits fill every inch of the film with mystery, horror, and intense stimulation.</p>
<p>The story tells of an international thief, a fugitive mixing in this place. Betrayed by his accomplices and pursued by detectives, he manages to escape, only to succumb to a beautiful French woman—and lose his life.</p>
<p>Charles Boyer gives a very profound portrayal of the bandit's character in this film. Hedy Lamarr, who starred in "Ecstasy," also demonstrates excellent acting skills. Xue Lie Jiali, in her first film, "The Adventures of Marco Polo," where she played Kublai Khan's daughter, left us with a very good impression. In this film, she plays an indigenous woman who passionately loves the bandit, and her superb performance is worthy of our special praise.</p>
<p>Queen's Peace... Wings of the Army Men Wfth Wfngs</p>
<p>The entire film narrates the development of the American aviation industry over the past three or four decades. It can also be said to be a systematic narrative of mankind's conquest of space. At the same time, we often acknowledge it as a great and valuable work in the history of cinema.</p>
<p>The story seems to draw from too broad a range, resulting in a somewhat lengthy plot that may leave viewers feeling a slight lack of dramatic tension. However, the various tense and thrilling scenes completely mask this shortcoming. Scenes such as flight emergencies, aerial dogfights, death-defying test flights, and the heroic feat of the first transatlantic flight, along with escaping from burning planes with parachutes, are all extremely stimulating. There are also people full of enthusiasm, embracing a spirit of fearlessness and lofty ambitions, performing magnificent deeds. Behind them, there are women who encourage, help, and silently endure worry and tears. All of these elements possess the power to manipulate the emotions of the audience.</p>
<p>The use of color in this film is exceptionally appropriate. The beauty of the scenes, from the initial scenes of wild scenery to the various brightly colored airplanes soaring in the blue sky filled with colorful clouds, adds greatly to the aesthetic experience of the audience.</p>
<p>Fred MacMurray and Ray Milland's acting skills are highly refined. The female lead, Louise Campbell, is a rising star who previously played roles in some rather ordinary films, receiving little attention. In this film, we discover that she is an extremely promising talent.</p>
<p>East... Song of the Condemned Sfng Your Sinners</p>
<p>A musical film interspersed with comedy, rich in laughter. The races within are both tense and humorous. Starring Pinky Thuss Berry and Fred MacMurray.</p>
<p>Great China—Blockade Blockade</p>
<p>This film depicts the activities of traitors during wartime, but on the other hand, it exposes the cruelty of war. This is a point that the creators particularly emphasize. The director uses lively camera angles to reflect various insidious tactics such as bombing and blockades. Henry Fonda and Madeleine Carroll also give decent performances.</p>
<p>Central... Woman</p>
<p>Mandarin Film</p>
<p>This is a silent film from three years ago, now adapted. The film's message is very correct; the writer is entirely advocating for the plight of women in the past few years who are not well understood.</p>
<p>Overall, it is not necessarily more advanced than when it was a silent film. The writing is more lively, and the rising star Lu Ming and the other actors all perform well.</p>

<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>What can be written? Lately, my mind is filled with numbers. One that stands out is about the origin of Robert Ripley's "Believe It or Not!" What amazed him was the sheer number of Chinese people. According to his calculations, if the Chinese people were to walk in rows of four, it would take a year to pass a certain point, and only 29,840,000 people would have passed. Even if the population only increased by one-twentieth each year, they would never finish walking. This amazement was originally just a numbers game, but another newspaper in the United States turned it into a cartoon titled "The New Great Wall," which revealed a great significance.</p>
<p>At the same time, I recalled what Hendrik Willem van Loon told us in his geography book about the insignificance of mankind. He calculated that the total volume of all 1.9 billion people in the world is less than one cubic kilometer. This static calculation is naturally too imaginative. But if we generously allow every seven-foot-tall person space to move around, then each person would need no more than five square meters. The entire world's population could easily fit on the small island of Bali in the South Sea Paradise. If we housed them all in 200-story skyscrapers, then a plot of land seven kilometers long and seven kilometers wide would be enough.</p>
<p>Human housing requirements are not great. For clothing, in the tropics, a piece of cloth or a banana leaf is sufficient. The biggest problem is food. Assuming that each person needs one kilogram of water and one kilogram of food per day, then each person's monthly consumption is equal to their body volume, and half a year's consumption is equal to the space they need. If it were possible to stockpile a lifetime's supply, each person would need 500 cubic meters of space to store it, not to mention how much land would be needed for production.</p>
<p>Neither millionaires nor billionaires have enough money to feed the world's population for three months. Food is calculated at very low prices in some places, but if it is sold on the international market, even the cheapest sweet potatoes would cost two dimes per kilogram. This means that the world's population would spend at least 146 billion yuan on food each year, exceeding the total global trade volume in recent years. China's population accounts for one-quarter of the world's population, meaning that they consume 100 million yuan of food per day. If Chinese land were controlled and not allowed to produce food, but only produce raw materials such as cotton and hemp, then the rest of the world could specialize in handling food business for the Chinese, and the Chinese could exchange for countless wealth if they could go without food.</p>
<p>However, the people's food, although not exchangeable for money, has a latent power that is extremely noteworthy. Three consecutive years of bumper harvests have already set the stage for victory. Most of our compatriots have not even heard of the term "wartime food rationing," and we are fortunate not to need it. Not long ago, General Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone, said: "China's current difficulties are not great. If compared with the difficulties faced by Germany and Russia during the First World War, we can simply say, 'We have no difficulties!'" Given such favorable circumstances, and facing a country where even primary school students usually eat "Rising Sun meals" and even go hungry, and where all people are now living under food rationing, how can we not be confident?</p>
<p>However, this blessing of not being subject to food rationing should not be fully enjoyed in such times. We are promoting conservation, but it seems that no one has yet calculated the massive amount that this conservation will amount to. Let's calculate based on the above assumption of each person consuming one kilogram of food per day. If it is rice, that is about four bowls. By eating one bowl less, the entire nation can save one-quarter of 100 million yuan per day. Even at the lowest price for the cheapest food, it cannot be less than five million yuan per day, which is more than 160 million yuan per year. Let us calculate this power in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Boat <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Because I live on an "island," I think of boats.</p>
<p>Among transportation vehicles, I like boats the most; because boats sail on the sea, and I love the vast and boundless sea; and appreciating the sea view requires being on a boat, so I love boats, for no other reason.</p>
<p>In summer, the summer of my imagination, sitting on the deck looking at the sunset reflected on the sea surface. How flavorful—but now it is winter. Winter, cold winds, heavy winds. Winds that sting the face, maddening winds, on the sea surface, blowing up waves, making the waves jump, jumping in the air, like ping-pong balls falling on marble. This is also a sea scene, a living sea scene, and only by lying on a small boat can one appreciate the fun of it.</p>
<p>Boats, steamers, sailboats, lifeboats are all things on the water, and water, you can't catch it, you can't hold it tight, listening to it, the sun shining on it, the moon reflecting the light of the sun, the stars twinkling, mankind forever crawling on the ground, and boats forever swimming on the water, swimming, swimming until the end of time.</p>
<p>Isn't life just a boat? Crossing from this side to the other, that's a lifetime. If the boat capsizes halfway, then it can only perish forever: if there is flesh and blood, life, then struggle, overcome the wind and waves, tighten the sails, hold the rudder firmly, and bravely squeeze out of the difficulties.</p>
<p>The sea is calm, the water surface is flat, waiting for the light on the other shore.</p>
<p>Heaven? Hell? Without a boat to ferry us, how can our feet stand firm on that day? Swaying east, swaying west, staring blankly at the lights on the other shore, waiting in vain, waiting in vain for a lifetime.</p>
<p>If the oars are raised, the boat will move, will float on the water, and will proceed to the harbor ahead.</p>
<p>Charles Baudelaire of France said: "The harbor is a pleasant place for those weary of life's hardships. The distant sky, the changing clouds, the uncertain sea colors, and the light of the lighthouse, form a beautiful scene, enough to make the eyes delight in it. The slender boat, with its intricate rigging swaying with the waves, is enough to keep the soul in love with the beauty of rhythm. And for those without ambition or curiosity, there is a mysterious and noble pleasure. Sitting quietly in a tower, or leaning on the railing of the shore, quietly watching the activities of those people: some are setting sail, some are sailing back, some still have the will to travel, or to get rich."</p>
<p>This "beautiful scene," this "mysterious and noble pleasure," is on the sea, in the boat, also before our eyes, and even more in our minds.</p>
<p>We also have the "will to power," not to travel, not to get rich, but to prop up the human boat, overcome the waves, defeat all harmful magical waves, and destroy all unjust demons; let a small boat float quietly on the Pacific Ocean, watching the sun sink into the beautiful scenery in the west.</p>

<h3 id="e24">On Excretion <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Ding San</p>
<p>Our defecating, urinating, and sweating are originally the excretion of waste materials from the body. If these waste materials accumulate, then they will not only prevent the absorption of nutrients, but will also become toxins, weakening the entire body.</p>
<p>Toxins in the body sometimes lurk internally, causing internal diseases; sometimes they erupt externally, causing external diseases. To treat internal diseases, one must promote bowel movements and sweating; to treat external diseases, one must cut and treat sores and boils; in short, it is first of all about relying on excretion.</p>
<p>The institutions of political society are somewhat similar to the institutions of individual physiology, although they cannot be mechanically regarded as the same. There are nutrients—healthy components, and waste—corrupt components. To strengthen the nation, it is natural to start with the institutions of political society. Ruthlessly eradicate the corrupt components, and introduce healthy components.</p>
<p>Waste in the institutions of political society will similarly prevent the absorption of nutrients; and if allowed to grow and develop, the result will inevitably become toxins. These toxins sometimes lurk in the dark, carrying out their destructive role, causing the nation to develop hidden diseases; sometimes they erupt openly, carrying out their ulcerative role, causing the nation to develop external diseases. To treat this kind of disease, the entire nation must have acute awareness, and wage an unyielding struggle against those toxins that have become waste, eliminate them, cut them away!</p>
<p>However, perhaps some will ask, won't doing so split the unity of the nation? Then, I will also ask in return: Does your defecating, urinating, sweating, or cutting away rotten flesh after developing sores split the unity of your body? Does such a question make sense? It doesn't! Because if waste and toxins are not excreted, they will not only fail to strengthen unity, but will instead destroy unity; excreting waste and toxins is precisely eliminating the components that harm unity, so as to absorb more and enhance the components of unity, and make the nation stronger!</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not overthink the fact that some corrupt components entrenched in the institutions of political society are being successively eliminated as a split in unity, but rather should rejoice in the strengthening of unity.</p>
<p>Our country's resistance against Japan this time, from an internal point of view, is a general excretion, which is also called a general liquidation. In the war of resistance, the waste and toxins that had accumulated in the institutions of political society over the years—separatist warlords, corrupt officials, and traitors—were revealed in their original form and eliminated; at the same time, those progressive elements who resolutely resisted Japan, were courageous and active, and were hardworking and enduring, were absorbed and employed; making our country's united war of resistance stronger and stronger due to the change in quality!</p>
<p>The more tense the war of resistance, the easier it is for those wastes and toxins to be exposed, and the easier it is to excrete them. This is by no means a bad phenomenon, but rather a good phenomenon. This is by no means splitting unity, but strengthening unity. We must not be pessimistic because of this, but should instead be optimistic, and should also step up the excretion work, so that our strength in the war of resistance becomes stronger; only then can we win the final victory in the war of resistance and national construction!</p>
<h3 id="e25">[Wheat and Soldiers] <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Youru</p>
<p>Written by Hino Ashihei, translated by Zhei Fei</p>
<p>In the current Japanese "war literature," "Wheat and Soldiers" can be considered a relatively noteworthy work. Although neither ideologically nor artistically does this book give us any deep impressions, nevertheless, as the translator says: "To some extent, he can still objectively record the facts... and can provide some insights that are beneficial to our resistance." If we can read it with a correct perspective, we can see some useful things from it.</p>
<p>The author, Hino Ashihei, is considered a typical figure in the "Imperial Army." This "Wheat and Soldiers" is his war diary from the Battle of Xuzhou, his personal battle record. However, the entire situation of the Battle of Xuzhou cannot be seen from within; perhaps the author intentionally avoided this record, in order not to expose their failure in this great battle. However, in the short eighteen-day diary, what deserves our attention first is that the author has repeatedly narrated the bravery of Chinese soldiers in battle and constantly praised them, and unintentionally admitted and revealed the difficulties faced by the Japanese army in its operations in China, such as "War is indeed difficult, not as easy as imagined," "The future of the war is infinitely distant," and along the way there are guerrilla attacks, and the Chinese people's assistance to the Chinese army in combat. The author faithfully recorded all of this in his diary. Among them, the description of the bravery of Chinese soldiers, such as the situation of the fierce battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies on May 11, states: "The tenacity and bravery of the enemy (referring to the Chinese army) is truly astonishing. They are absolutely unwilling to retreat, sometimes even leaning out of the walls to shoot and throw grenades... The Chinese army is truly brave, and even after the Japanese army occupied it, they launched two counterattacks." Another example is the Battle of Zhao Erzhuang: "The Chinese army is truly fierce, and shows no sign of retreating; although smoke was used to cover and launch assaults, it still did not succeed." [May 18] He also wrote that Chinese soldiers would rather commit suicide with grenades than surrender; and those who were captured also calmly met their deaths without fear, which the author himself could not help but "respect." Since the war of resistance began, the bravery of our army has long won the praise of people at home and abroad, but when it is said from the mouths of the Japanese, it is even more moving.</p>
<p>In contrast to the bravery of the Chinese soldiers is the Japanese soldiers' weariness and terror of the war. "The soldiers are all filled with homesickness, longing to return home as soon as possible. However, just a single bullet can instantly ruin everything... I don't want to die, I don't want to die here... Although I believe I am not without courage, I don't want to die here now, and who can be sure that they won't die here?" This is such a painful confession. For example, Saito and his brother (they are the only two brothers) were ordered to come to China to fight. The brother had already been killed in Shanghai, and Saito was very worried about his own fate and the two elders at home. The author sympathizes with him and writes his own opinion: "Even though we do not hesitate to sacrifice our lives for the country, lives that can be saved should not be sacrificed innocently... We should still value life" (May 11). Since they want to "value life," they should not have war at all, but who drove them to the line of death to "make unnecessary sacrifices"? Isn't this the crime of the Japanese fascist militarists? Unfortunately, the author's political consciousness limited him, so that he could not have a further understanding of the root of this crime. As a result, apart from sighs and sighs, he could not think of any other way.</p>
<p>However, the author, who is considered a typical figure in the "Imperial Army," has not lost his own conscience after all, and sometimes still has a vague sense of justice. Therefore, he could not help but feel uncomfortable about the aggressive atrocities of the Japanese army. "Whenever I see Chinese soldiers and villagers, I always feel a little different, they are simply too similar to the Japanese. Moreover, I can often find the faces of my friends among them. Sometimes it's so similar that it's annoying. This may be nothing more than my own sentimentality, but after all, we are of the same culture, the same race, and the same Asian nation, and our ideas are not far apart in a broad sense, but now we are actually cruelly killing these neighbors as enemies, and I really feel a little unbearable." (May 14) This is the author's heartfelt repentance, his suspicion and dissatisfaction with the war of aggression against China.</p>
<p>This kind of psychology, which is universally present in Japanese soldiers - weariness, terror, suspicion and dissatisfaction with the war - is extremely important for our resistance. It makes us firmly believe that strengthening propaganda to Japanese soldiers, prompting them to wake up, and striving for them to come to our side and jointly oppose the Japanese fascist militarists is not only necessary but also possible.</p>
<p>Secondly, looking at the vigor of Chinese morale and the withering of Japanese morale, we also firmly believe that the inevitable defeat of the Japanese militarists' reactionary war of aggression and the inevitable victory of the Chinese nation's progressive war of resistance against aggression is by no means an empty fantasy, but a fact in the development of history.</p>
<p>The above are some of the correct understandings we have gained from "Wheat and Soldiers" - "Insights that are beneficial to our resistance."</p>
<p>Asano Akira, a Japanese fascist literary "critic," once pointed out the failure of Japanese "war literature" in recent years, saying: "The works that have always been considered great in the Japanese literary world, after being translated and published in Chinese newspapers and magazines, Chinese readers simply find them to be good materials for 'anti-Japanese' and 'insulting Japan.'" Indeed, we also feel this way after reading this "Wheat and Soldiers," which is still very popular in Japan. It is not only a good material for "anti-Japanese" and "insulting Japan," but also has done some good publicity work for our resistance!</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot give Hino Ashihei's diary too high an evaluation. Whether in terms of the meaning of the content or the writing technique, it is far inferior to Tatsuzo Ishikawa's "Living Soldiers." But compared to some works by Japanese soldiers (such as "Diary of an Enemy Soldier in the Trenches" translated by Tian Han and Xia Yan, and some texts searched from Japanese soldiers), it is indeed an excellent work. The description of the attack on Sunping City and the march in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is vivid and the language is concise and clear, which shows that the author is not without literary talent. In addition, there are many other wonderful parts in the book. We cannot lightly dismiss it as "inevitably too trivial" (the translator's words). (January 5)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Today's First Division Football League: Kwong Wah Club Faces Long Odds; Likely to Lose After Previous Draw with Scots <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] Bitter winds and cold rain, turning cold overnight; football players are downcast. The reason is that although they are not afraid of the wind, they are afraid of the rain.</p>
<p>Today, there is only one First Division football match: Kwong Wah versus Scots, at the Kowloon Cricket Club ground. Let's hope that the heavens are kind and smile upon us, and not ruin the good football match.</p>
<p>In the first round of matches, the two teams drew 5-5. At that time, Kwong Wah was full of vigor and showed promise, unlike their current state of decline. On the other hand, Scots' performance had not yet returned to normal, just like Kwong Wah's current situation.</p>
<p>Now that they are facing each other again, it is predicted that Kwong Wah faces long odds. In addition, the rain makes the field slippery, which is even more unfavorable to Kwong Wah. It is feared that their quick passing in the front line will be difficult to execute, and short passing will be even more impossible. Because on the Kowloon Cricket Club ground, using short passes is tantamount to suicide.</p>
<p>Although Scots' strength is not particularly abundant, their fighting spirit is excellent. Their ability to defeat South China the other day was entirely due to this. They are particularly good at that kind of fierce passing and sudden attacks. Even Bao Jiaping, the experienced South China goalkeeper, is somewhat afraid of them.</p>
<p>Given Kwong Wah's increasingly poor record and Scots' gradual improvement, the outcome will inevitably follow the natural law of the survival of the fittest. However, we have no extravagant hopes for Kwong Wah; we only ask that they lose less often than they win, and that will be considered a satisfactory outcome. The lineups of the two teams are as follows: (Football God of Misfortune)</p>
<p>Kwong Wah Club</p>
<p>Li Guoqi</p>
<p>Zhong Huilin, Hou Rongsheng</p>

<h3 id="e27">Marching in the Rain: Eastern Football Club Floods Hong Kong Football Club, Winning 3-2 <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Hong Kong Football Club and Eastern Football Club had a water battle at the Hong Kong Football Club ground. All the players were covered in mud, like plantain leaves beaten by the rain, sometimes falling to the ground head over heels, sometimes sliding more than ten feet, as if ice skating. Although marching was difficult, it brought constant laughter to the audience. Under these circumstances, the progress of the battle could not be controlled by skill. Therefore, although Hong Kong Football Club's lineup was not complete, their desperate fight often made it difficult for Eastern to cope. In the 25th minute of the second half, they finally won 3-2.</p>
<p>Yesterday, except for Song Lingsheng who could not play, Deqi and Chengtuo both played with injuries, contributing to the victory. Wu Qixiang and Yu Qiaxing played two consecutive matches (Eastern's Second Division also played Hong Kong Football Club, and at that time Eastern was short of players, so Wu Yu joined the battle), which was quite tiring. The "short-legged tiger" Liu Shizuan ran all over the field, frowning and glaring in the entanglement, but always smiling, getting more and more energetic. He and Xu Luo formed a line of defense, like a copper wall and iron barrier, especially showing their edge in the second half, truly a good general with both courage and strategy.</p>
<p>After the start of the match, Hong Kong Football Club was short of players, starting with ten men. In the third minute, center forward Wilson dribbled the ball bravely forward. Zhong Yun was about to intercept, but because the battlefield was wet and slippery, he fell and flipped over. Wilson took the opportunity to shoot, and the ball went straight into the net, taking a 1-0 lead. After the restart, Eastern immediately counterattacked. Chengtuo started an uprising on the wing, passing out a brilliant ball. Deqi did not fail in his mission, scoring with one kick, tying the score 1-1. In the seventh minute, Hong Kong Football Club's left center back joined the battle line. In the 25th minute, Guoqi passed the ball to Chengtuo. Chengtuo dribbled past the defender, creating a one-on-one advantage, and tried to score, but was blocked by goalkeeper Gao Na, losing a good opportunity. After a while, Chengtuo made three consecutive close shots, but unfortunately the force was not strong enough, so Gao Na caught them one by one. Soon, the halftime whistle sounded.</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, Hong Kong Football Club worked hard to strengthen their attack. In the fourth minute, Di Pailu squatted down in front of the goal and passed a perfect ball. When the ball flashed past the goal, Wilson nodded his head, and the ball went into the net, taking the lead again with a score of 2-1. In the seventh minute, Eastern's forwards charged into Hong Kong Football Club's hinterland like an overwhelming mountain. Goalkeeper Gao Na came out of the city to defend. Deqi passed the ball to Yu Qiaxing to avoid his attack. Yu Qiaxing gently swept the ball into the goal, tying the score again 2-2. In the 25th minute, Hou Chengtuo launched a solo sneak attack. Hong Kong Football Club's defenders chased in vain. Finally, Chengtuo kicked one in from close range in front of the goal, making the score 3-2. The score remained the same until the end of the match, and Eastern won. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Eastern Football Club)</p>
<p>Xu Heng</p>
<p>Miao Huaguo, Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shizuan</p>
<p>Hou Chengtuo, Yu Qia Yu, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu</p>

<p>[Our Special Report] Yesterday, the cold wind was piercing and the drizzle was continuous. The field was wet and slippery, making it difficult to gallop. The football league was inevitably affected by the weather, making it difficult to stage a good match. At the Kowloon Cricket Club ground, Middlesex and Kowloon Cricket Club met again. After a water battle, the players turned into mud ducks, making it difficult to distinguish between people and ghosts. As a result, the British army lost again with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>Yesterday's battle was difficult to control due to the wet field and slippery ball, so there was no brilliant performance. The British army's defeat was due to the lack of good players and the messy formation. Crow, who was originally the soul of the front line, could not play due to an unhealed foot injury. Watson, who was originally a good defender, was forced to serve as a forward due to the lack of people in the front line. With talents not being used properly, it was difficult for the generals to give full play to their strengths.</p>
<p>Kowloon Cricket Club is accustomed to fighting on this field (having never lost in home matches), and has the advantage of terrain. The generals are also willing to work hard, passing and charging as soon as the ball arrives, and advancing without delay. Zuo Zhi, Billy and Belo performed well, and their strict defense repeatedly rejected the enemy's attack. Heli made the greatest contribution by tightly guarding the city. The others were competent.</p>
<p>After Middlesex defeated Kowloon Cricket Club 4-0 in the Second Division match, the First Division match kicked off. The two teams faced each other, and the British army began to attack, surrounding the city on three routes. Kowloon tightly tied its formation, gathering heavy troops at the important passes, and intercepting along the way. Billy commanded the army, fiercely charging and fighting hand-to-hand. The British army was forced to give up the occupied positions and return to defend.</p>
<p>Kowloon Cricket Club took advantage of the victory to pursue. Little Norris spied along the side and fired a shot at the goal. Hanibolo responded in front of the formation, intending to rush the ball into the net. However, the field was slippery and difficult to run on, and he stumbled, missing the opportunity. Little Norris refused to let go, rushed forward and swept the ball towards the goal, but unfortunately he acted too hastily and the ball went over the goal, missing a good opportunity.</p>
<p>The British army survived the disaster. Jackson sent the ball into the center of the field. The field was wet and the ball was heavy, and it fell to the ground 30 yards from the goal, landing right in front of Zhiweidi. Zhiweidi took advantage of the goalkeeper's failure to return to defense and quickly passed it to the front line. Zuo Zhi shot from 20 yards away. Jackson did not expect this move and was caught off guard, losing the goal, and Kowloon Cricket Club opened the scoring 1-0.</p>
<p>After losing the goal, the British army tried hard to chase, and took the offensive. They approached the center several times, but because the connection was sparse, it was difficult to achieve success. After ten minutes of melee, there was no progress in the competition. Yihualishi moved to support, leaving his post without permission. Unexpectedly, Mala Balu broke through the siege and dribbled the ball in a counterattack. Yishiwen was forced to abandon his defense and meet him, falling into a trap. Watson stole into the center and broke the duck egg, tying the score 1-1.</p>
<p>After the restart, Kowloon Cricket Club, unwilling to just draw after winning, attacked again, and the British army's goal was in danger again. Everyone was on edge, and the defenders worked together to resist, repeatedly saving dangerous balls. However, Gao Ba performed abnormally, making frequent mistakes, giving the enemy an opportunity. He Wozhi got the ball, passed Jullidi, and handed it to Liao Yachen, who rushed up alone and shot diagonally from the side. The angle was beautiful, and Jackson could not save it, losing the goal again. The first half ended with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>After the break, the two sides changed sides and fought. The British army's offensive became stronger, launching a large-scale counterattack. Kowloon Cricket Club's position was surrounded and impenetrable. The five guards resisted desperately, and Heli turned the tide, performing well with Billy and Belo, winning applause and praise.</p>
<p>The two sides exchanged shots and fought fiercely. The British team lacked a person with the skill of piercing the willow leaves on the front line. Although they were able to gain the offensive, they could not score again. At the end of the match, Kowloon Cricket Club won again with a score of 2-1. The lineup is as follows: [Solid Foundation]</p>

<p>[Our Special Report] The drizzle continued, and the biting cold wind made people's souls almost break. However, the basketball hall attracted a lot of male and female fans, crowding it. This is because the girls are showing their heroism and forming an inextricable bond with the ball. The writer has had a great time and will record the battle situation.</p>
<p>In the first match, Pui To faced South China. Most people already knew the outcome, because Pui To is an undefeated team in this tournament, while South China can't even beat Southwest, which has mediocre strength. How can they defeat her? Therefore, from the beginning of the first quarter, South China was at a disadvantage. However, at this time, South China's generals were still full of energy. Until the end of the first quarter, the loss was still minimal, only a difference of 2 to 4.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second quarter, South China's weaknesses were gradually revealed after the fierce battle. Pui To took advantage of this excellent opportunity and pressed hard, making South China's girls sweat profusely. At the end of this quarter, the score was 15 to 6.</p>
<p>The fierce battle started again, and South China showed some improvement. Yu Fen and Mei Wei worked very hard. In this quarter, Pui To only added two points by Yiyin and then gained nothing. So until the third quarter break, Pui To only led by a few points with a score of 17 to 10.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the continuation of the battle, South China still had some chances, but they all failed in the throwing action. Looking at Pui To, Yiyin was as nimble as a swimming dragon and Yinghua was as fierce as a tiger. However, South China did not shake its morale due to the increasingly lagging behind and fought hard against each other. The battle was tense, and Mei Wei made many endearing moves, causing the male and female fans to laugh. Soon, this scene ended in laughter, with a score of 28 to 13, and Pui To won.</p>
<p>The final match was Mei Fang against Huaqiao. Before the battle began, most people thought that a fierce battle would be necessary to resolve the final victory. However, after the contact, Huaqiao was lagging behind and in a disadvantageous position. In fact, looking at last night's battle situation, Huaqiao's Shouguang performed the best, and Rongtang and Huizhen were barely satisfactory. The rest were not worth mentioning. How could they beat this most powerful Mei Fang? And with this victory, Mei Fang's chance of winning the championship is even higher.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first quarter, Mei Fang first used Yuemei to temporarily replace Meilian. The strength was relatively weaker. At that time, Huaqiao's morale was high, so they fought fiercely and inextricably. After tying the score 3-3, Meibao replaced Yuemei from the applause as dense as military artillery. As expected, after this replacement, Mei Fang's morale was boosted. Until Meilian scored twice, Mei Fang took the lead with a score of 12-5. That was the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>In the second battle, Mei Fang was still brave. This little girl Meilian was like a freed rabbit when she moved. Huaqiao could not stop her even with the strength of Huizhen and others. It was indeed worthy of the name. At the end of the first half, the score was 22 to 0. Huaqiao was even more behind.</p>
<p>After eating oranges, they returned to the battlefield. In this quarter, except for Shouguang's consecutive successes and Rongtang's addition of one point, it was Mei Fang's world. Mei Fang alone scored six points by Meilian alone. Therefore, at the end of this quarter, the score was 30-16. Huaqiao's heroines were short of breath.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, Huaqiao still thought about recovering the lost ground. However, with only the strength of Rongtang and Shouguang, how could they succeed? Therefore, after the continuation of the battle, Huaqiao was still in a disadvantageous position. Until the end of the match, Mei Fang returned with a victory song with a score of 42-26.

<h3 id="e34">Roosevelt Formally Announces: Atlantic Fleet Permanently Stationed; Drafts Special Defense Plan; To Submit to Parliament Early Next Week <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] After issuing a warning to dictators, US President Roosevelt announced the permanent stationing of 35 warships in the Atlantic Ocean to strengthen national defense. It is an unprecedented move for the US fleet to be divided into two teams, stationed in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The Eastern and Western Fleets are assigned to guard certain locations to prevent foreign forces from approaching. The new fleet stationed in the Atlantic includes eight first-class battleships, eight new-style destroyers, four battleships, fifteen old destroyers, and many submarines and aircraft of undisclosed numbers. According to senior officials, this fleet is only the initial deployment to defend the Atlantic maritime power. According to President Roosevelt's plan, he is determined to build the United States into a country with sufficient first-class maritime power. The naval defense strength plan submitted to Congress for review has a budget of 200 million yuan, which can build more than 100 warships of all sizes. There are currently two battleships, two destroyers, eight destroyers, eight submarines, two aircraft carriers, and one repair ship under construction. The battleships currently planned to be built will be 45,000 tons.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] President Roosevelt's request to approve a public utility budget of 815 million is being carefully considered by a congressional review committee. According to observers, President Roosevelt's request and the 900 million budget for 1940 will cause heated discussions in Congress. However, it is expected that the number will not change much as a result of the discussion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] President Roosevelt told reporters today that he is currently drafting a special national defense plan and preparing to submit it to Congress early next week.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] British newspapers expressed no surprise at the large figures published by President Roosevelt for the US budget, saying, "Economists 30 years ago, seeing this huge budget, declared that the country must go bankrupt. However, the resources of modern powerful countries are extremely scalable and can cope with financial problems. Therefore, although the United States has a huge budget, there is no risk of bankruptcy. Moreover, the United States' national debt is only slightly larger than that of the United Kingdom, and the difference in its income is also negligible. The United Kingdom's national debt is almost twice as large as its income, so its financial situation is not as good as that of the United States."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 7th] President Roosevelt denied to the press that he or other government officials had received Colonel Lindbergh's secret report on the German Air Force.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Officials announced today that the US Department of Justice is investigating the Nazi Party, the Communist Party, and other parties for violating the country's criminal law. This move was triggered by someone submitting evidence of "anti-American activities" to the House of Representatives committee.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ottawa, 7th] Canada's new national defense budget totals 50 million yuan, the largest number since the European War. Most of this budget will be used to train air force personnel. Aviation schools will be established in Toronto. All air force personnel training will be conducted under the guidance of the Canadian Department of National Defense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] The local newspapers generally expressed their support for President Roosevelt's foreign policy and national defense plan. However, the newspapers criticized President Roosevelt's domestic unemployment relief and recovery plans. The Morning Post said that President Roosevelt claimed that the size of the preparations for work in the United States in the past six years was unprecedented in American history. In fact, during the implementation of the New Deal, only the money of taxpayers was indeed a huge number. The New York Times said that President Roosevelt still needs to make greater efforts to dispel the concerns of businessmen. The Los Angeles Times said that President Roosevelt's speech had an air of dictatorship.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 7th] French Prime Minister Daladier arrived in Toulon today. After returning to Paris, he will convene a high-level French military conference. The decision to convene this meeting was made after yesterday's important military conference in Algiers. The conference was presided over by Daladier, and senior French military officials and North African authorities participated. In view of Chamberlain's visit to Rome, the French high-level military conference to be convened is particularly important.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Algiers, 6th] Daladier said in a speech at a banquet hosted by the Governor of Algiers today, "France wants to maintain peace with all countries in the world and is willing to solve all major modern problems without the method of war, but with constructive efforts. If anyone thinks that this attitude is a symbol of France's weakness and retreat, then I will shout 'Stop!' I do not condemn all violent remarks. On the contrary, I want to thank those who publish such remarks, because from outside the French defense line, the French people have recognized the true face of France. I say that I am determined to maintain the integrity of the whole of France. This not only means that I will never cede an inch of French territory to others, but also that I will not discuss certain legal negotiations proposed by certain parties."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Marseille, Day] Yesterday, another 1,000 men of the Senegalese troops took the French transport ship "Ados II" to be stationed in French Somaliland. The case of British officials being falsely accused is currently under investigation.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] A diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" states: "As Japan refuses to maintain the 'Open Door' policy and takes unfair steps against the interests of Britain and other foreign countries, we have reason to believe that British cabinet ministers have been closely monitoring the Far East situation caused by these steps in recent days. They are now carefully considering active measures to deal with Japan. I understand that the Treasury has been asked to report on effective methods to change the minds of the Japanese. We have learned that the United States has also considered similar actions to protect American interests," he said.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] The Far East Department of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting here on the 10th.

Seward continued, saying that the transportation routes in China, which are commercially important, have been completely monopolized by Japan. Once the Sino-Japanese war ends, the issue of British trade with China will become even more serious. This chamber will not neglect its duties regarding British trade rights in China. The chamber will continue to cooperate closely with the United Association for Chinese Affairs, which is organized by the China Association and chambers of commerce from London, Bradford, Manchester, and other places (with its headquarters in London).</p>

Chamberlain and his party will depart from London on the morning of Tuesday next week and are expected to arrive in Paris at 5:30 PM. They will spend approximately two hours at the French Foreign Ministry for a meeting with the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Political circles here are paying close attention to this change in itinerary, as in recent days the French have been reluctant for the British to interfere in the Franco-Italian dispute. Moreover, Prime Minister Daladier's speech was even stronger than those in Corsica and Tunisia. British political circles are paying close attention to this. Furthermore, Chamberlain left London yesterday afternoon for Chequers, where he will stay until Sunday.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] According to reports from here, the conflict between Czechoslovakia and Hungary will be resolved directly by representatives from both sides. There were no new battles overnight, and Czechoslovak and Hungarian troops have retreated to their respective borders.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] According to dispatches from Budapest, serious clashes have occurred between Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It is reported that Czechoslovak troops attacked a town recently ceded to Hungary, and both sides exchanged artillery fire, resulting in numerous casualties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Hungarian envoy here said that Hungary's protest to Czechoslovakia was "very strong," expressing regret that Hungary's efforts to improve Hungarian-Czechoslovak relations had been thwarted by this incident, and stated that Hungary could not be held responsible for subsequent events.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 6th] The Hungarian chargé d'affaires in Czechoslovakia protested to the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry today, stating that Czechoslovakia should be responsible for yesterday's border conflict.

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese Finance Minister Ishiwata told reporters that in the past, Japan's fiscal policy had focused on achieving military objectives, but in the future, it would also take into account the recovery of China's vitality (?). However, the basic policy of former Finance Minister Yuki will still be firmly adhered to.

At the same time, Japan's military supplies must also be supplemented to adapt to the world situation.</p>

<p>After Wang Jingwei's plan to oppose the central government's policies was exposed, he fled Chongqing in haste and went abroad, already losing the qualities of a statesman. After going abroad, he then issued the so-called "Awakening Telegram," openly violating the central government's established policies, following the declaration of the Japanese prime minister, advocating national surrender to Japan, further exposing that his so-called opposition to the central government's policies was a conspiracy to betray the party and the country. The central government's resolution sternly pointed out that Wang Jingwei was colluding with Japan, betraying the party, and endangering the country. However, Wang was only limited to being expelled from the party and removed from his duties, which can be said to be lenient. All military and civilian officials and people from all walks of life, in addition to sending telegrams denouncing Wang's madness and supporting the central government's resolution, still retain some hope for Wang, because Wang is still regarded as a Chinese and a former Chinese politician. From Wang's perspective, even if he cannot commit ritual suicide to apologize to the people of the country, he should also consider the situation, retreat in the face of difficulty, and await punishment. This is precisely the ideal of those who cherish Wang, and can be said to be the minimum hope of the general public.</p>
<p>However, according to recent news from various sources, it proves that Wang has no intention of repenting and is secretly intensifying his activities. On the one hand, he is using his propaganda tools to fabricate false news and spread shameless rumors, either saying that the National Government is leaning to the left and that the Communist Party is surrounding Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, or saying that the government will issue an order to confiscate private savings, including banks in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Their absurdity is not worth discussing, but their attempt to alienate cooperation between our parties and the unity of officials and people is malicious and the same as the tactics of Japan. On the other hand, he also plans to organize a new party as a preparation for organizing a puppet government. This behavior, in terms of the degradation of Wang's personal political morality, is not worth mentioning. But for the insult to the Chinese people, even those who cherished Wang and advised Wang in the past will probably no longer tolerate it!</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Chongqing, telegrams from generals, troops, administrative heads, and civil groups from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Nanyang, and other places supporting the central government's punishment of Wang are flying in. Among these telegrams, Zhang Fakui, Yu Hanmou, and others advocated that the central government arrest Wang and bring him to justice. Governors of various provinces and civil groups in North China requested to strip Wang of his nationality and confiscate Wang's property and real estate. Various circles in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Nanyang, in addition to the above requests, also expressed that they do not recognize Wang as a Cantonese and requested that his propaganda tools be immediately banned. This news further proves that if Wang does not repent and reform, and continues to resort to his old tricks of confusing right and wrong and disturbing people's minds, then even if the world is vast, Wang will have nowhere to stand. Offending the people cannot be atoned for. Repentance has a limit!</p>
<h3 id="e51">A New Factor in the Evolution of the European Situation <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— (Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in London) Uncle Didi</p>
<p>In the development of the general European situation in recent days, especially in the future steps of Britain and France in foreign affairs, a new factor has been added; this is the sudden activeness of the American attitude towards the world situation recently.</p>
<p>If we analyze the psychological reaction of the British government and the public to this new factor, the components are clearly threefold: First, naturally, a feeling of relief is emitted, and the speech increases strength and courage; second, based on the idea of ​​appeasement, some people in Britain are also slightly worried about it - they are afraid that the open conflict between the United States and the three aggressive countries of Germany, Japan and Italy will involve Britain as well.</p>
<p>Although there is such a contradiction in psychology, at least before the so-called "Four-Power Pact" is formed, the foreign steps of Britain and France are indeed under great pressure from this attitude of the United States. Of course, Chamberlain and Daladier's cabinets, which took advantage of the possibility of American aid and attempted to conclude a "Four-Power Pact" with Germany and Italy in one fell swoop, now feel greatly troubled and have to consider the steps to adapt to this new factor.</p>
<p>According to what is known here, the main reasons for the sudden outbreak of this attitude of the United States are: First, the recent complete cracking of the secret organizations of the three aggressive countries of Germany, Japan and Italy in the Americas, as a result, Germany's major joint conspiracy against Canada, Japan's against countries near the Panama Canal, and Italy's against countries in South America were discovered. Second, the current British and French cabinets stubbornly alienated the Soviet Union, losing the power to deal with Germany and Italy. The diplomatic policies pursued by the Chamberlain and Daladier cabinets aroused deep unease and suspicion in the United States. Another factor that induced the outbreak of this attitude was the mutual recrimination between the United States and Germany caused by Germany's abuse of Jews.</p>
<p>However, so far, the United States has not put forward its specific line to the British and French authorities. According to all open and behind-the-scenes actions, this positive attitude of the United States seems to have only reached the point of urging British and French public opinion to restrain the British and French authorities.</p>
<p>First, the obstacles laid down by the United States on the road to the so-called "Four-Power Pact"</p>
<p>In a previous telegram, the reporter pointed out the temporary shelving of the so-called "Four-Power Pact" in Europe. Now, if we look at it from another perspective, if the four countries of Britain, France, Germany and Italy are sincerely implementing this pact, then, on the road to its achievement. The first step must also overcome the obstacles laid down by the United States. The biggest obstacle is the cession of colonies. Probably in the latter part of last month (November), it was when the issue of ceding colonies was most clamorous. According to the plans of some people in the British government, they intended to cede a part of West Africa to Germany. This unofficial plan was immediately blocked by the United States. As a result, President Roosevelt immediately asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, to meet and put forward a relative request: If this plan is realized, then the United States must also demand from Britain and France the same rights as Germany in colonial rights. For some British and French territories within the sphere of influence of the United States, the United States is prepared to propose the establishment of naval bases, or complete cession. The reason is that if Germany establishes a base in West Africa, then the American Atlantic route will definitely be harassed by Germany in wartime. For safety, the United States can only demand equality with Germany. The same notice was also sent to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the same time. As a result, the authorities of Britain and France discussed the results, coupled with other considerations, and decided to temporarily shelve this plan. Following this, the British Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald and the French Foreign Minister Bonnet formally issued statements separately but simultaneously denying the existence of such a plan. The second obstacle is the tension in diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany and Italy due to the abuse of Jews. Now, the United States and Germany have each recalled their ambassadors to each other. At this time, if Britain and France were to actively carry out the "Four-Power Pact," then the trend is very possible, the United States would immediately declare a complete severance of diplomatic relations with Germany, giving the "Four-Power Pact" a fatal blow. Of course, the Chamberlain cabinet, which decided to temporarily stop the "Four-Power Pact" from proceeding, could not be happier about the tension in diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany, because it could use this opportunity to devote itself to the construction of military mercenaries and temporarily postpone Germany's proposal to limit armaments. Here is the source of Chamberlain's avoidance of meeting with Schacht, the president of the German National Bank, during his visit to Britain not long ago, and even further, in the House of Commons, he actually said that Anglo-German relations cannot be improved further when Germany does not further express its desire for "peace."</p>
<p>Second, the hints given by the United States in the foreign policy of Britain and France towards Japan</p>
<p>In the past few months, British Prime Minister Chamberlain and others often dragged the United States into the explanation of concessions to Germany and Italy, saying that the United States did not cooperate with Britain in the Far East, so Britain was caught between the enemy. However, this week, the United States suddenly publicly expressed its attitude towards the Far East. The clearest, as far as we know, has been three times in the past two months: The first time was when the European crisis was tense. The US Secretary of State Hull officially guaranteed to Britain that when the British Navy was dealing with Italy in Europe, the US Pacific Fleet would definitely cooperate with Britain to deal with Japan. The second time, after Guangzhou, Hankou and Chongqing were captured, a small number of wavering people in Britain were secretly planning to start negotiations with Japan and establish a local compromise in southern China. The United States suddenly proposed to Japan to abide by the "Nine-Power Treaty." At the same time, it requested that Britain take the same steps. The third time; it is the recent decision to grant credit loans to China. As Chinese compatriots living here, when we witnessed that a few people in Britain were still dreaming of "mediation" and "compromise" and were unwilling to help China completely defeat Japan, we suddenly saw the resolute action of the United States, and we could not help but feel an indescribable emotion. Therefore, the American reporter for the Times immediately reported the fundamental significance of this move by the United States to the British people, which was: (1) The United States has absolutely no possibility of recognizing any so-called "fait accompli" declared by Japan; (2) The United States especially does not believe that Japan's aggression has produced any "fait accompli". Immediately afterwards, the US reporter of the Daily Telegraph, which is one of the two major intellectual newspapers of the British Conservative Party, also immediately reported to the British people that the US officials believed that Japan's economic situation was already very dangerous; and time is on the side of China. As long as China always maintains its current strong morale, it will definitely be able to defeat Japan in the end. Therefore, in order to express its consensus with the United States, Britain immediately agreed to a part of the long-awaited credit loan. However, the reporter's personal view is that this move by Britain was actually mostly a passive response to the United States, and did not actively abandon her "compromise" and "mediation" ideas and further thoroughly help China, although British public opinion praised this move for once. However, the trend has become very obvious recently, the United States has regained the traditional leading role in diplomacy in that regard in the Far East diplomatic policy. At this time when Britain and France are voluntarily unable to do anything in Europe, Britain and France will only follow the lead of the United States in the short term in the Far East.</p>
<p>On the Spanish issue. The United States also has deep disgust and unease about Italy's demand for Franco's complete victory. According to the discovered Italian secret plan, it is planned to wait until Franco establishes his regime and then use Spanish blood ties to extend its power to South American countries. The United States has sent a notification that is difficult to ignore to the British and French authorities on this point. Therefore, Chamberlain's upcoming talks with Mussolini in Rome is a major difficulty. It was rumored here some time ago that Britain and France might be able to meet Mussolini's requirements on the condition that Mussolini agreed to leave the German-Italian axis, but in the past two days, it is said that a new plan is being drafted. This new plan is to stop the current civil war in Spain under international auspices, and then, after a year or two of truce, invite representatives from both sides again. The international community will convene a meeting to seek a "reasonable" solution.</p>
<p>In short, the role of the United States' active attitude in British and French foreign policy has already begun.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Exposing Traitors <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Three People's Principles, the program of resistance and national reconstruction, the Five Guidelines of the Hengshan Conference, and recently Chairman Chiang's refutation of the Konoe Declaration are the right path to saving the nation, and no deviation is permissible. If someone outwardly complies but inwardly opposes, what methods can be used to systematically uncover them? This is an important question worth considering. I now propose five avenues for identifying traitors, as a basis for discussion among the people. I hope everyone will offer their guidance on whether they are appropriate.</p>
<p>(1) He pretends to do what should be done sincerely. Hanging a sheep's head but selling dog meat falls into this category. Previously, a certain place hung a sign promoting mass movements, while simultaneously buying off beggars for parades and arresting those genuinely serving the people. At that time, I wrote a four-line poem to record this event, saying: "Fake work, two mao; real work, thrown in jail." Wang Jingwei uses the banner of all-out resistance to write articles opposing guerrilla warfare, which is simply mixing dog meat into lamb.</p>
<p>(2) He spends lavishly on what should be done frugally. China is a poor country, and even poorer since the war began. Everything must be done frugally to succeed. If someone spends lavishly on one thing, leaving no money for other things, it is tantamount to squeezing out other important matters. Only frugality can ensure that all important matters are considered and addressed. If one only cares about squandering money like dirt on one thing, causing other matters to be delayed, it is very suspicious.</p>
<p>(3) He separates what should be done together. For example, the final victory of the war of resistance depends on the unity of the entire nation, which depends on cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It requires everyone to work together to succeed. Japan does not like this, so it proposes the conspiracy of joint anti-communism. Japan's aim of anti-communism is to use us to fight the Soviet Union on its behalf. If we fall into its trick, it is simply national subjugation. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot be separated, and will not be separated. Japan and the traitors are wasting their efforts. We, the common people, are not only the matchmakers for Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, but also the priests of the Catholic god of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. We only wish them to live together in harmony until old age, and will not allow them to divorce. However, Japan always wants to use Chinese to control Chinese, and the traitors, relying on its support, always want to sow discord. At one meeting, more than a dozen people said: "If this war continues, victory will not belong to Japan, nor to the Kuomintang, but only to the Communist Party." These people are simply speaking as Japan's representatives. What I want to say is: if we unite to the end, victory will belong to the entire Chinese nation. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will have a share. Now, anyone who wants to separate China's strength and weaken China's unity is someone who should be investigated.</p>
<p>(4) He does slowly what should be done quickly. China has two big hands: one is the Southwest Railway; the other is the Northwest Railway. These two hands must reach out quickly and bring things quickly, so that they can quickly drive out Japanese imperialism. Have these two hands already reached out quickly? Who is holding them back??</p>
<p>(5) He does small what should be done big. Recently, the United States wants to train 100,000 airplane pilots. According to population proportion, China should have 400,000 pilots. Even a 10% cut would be 40,000. Another 10% cut would be 4,000. However, the former Italian consultant advocated that pilot training should be "rather lack than waste," valuing quality over quantity. What a good shield this is! Even Mr. Hu Shi has been advocating this kind of traitorous theory. This time, I met a physical educator in Haiphong. He said that he and 162 physical education students applied to aviation schools, but only two people were admitted. Although the pilots are skilled, few are not enough for combat, so we only see foreign planes coming to China, but not Chinese planes going to Japan. We have been deceived by traitors in many things, resulting in big things being done small.</p>
<p>These five ways to identify traitors should be closely followed and investigated. If he pretends to do what should be done sincerely, he is suspicious. If he does it sincerely, but spends lavishly on what should be done frugally, he is suspicious. If he does it sincerely and frugally, but separates what should be done together, he is suspicious. If he does it sincerely, frugally, and together, but does slowly and small what should be done quickly and big, he is suspicious. If there is suspicion, follow the trail to investigate and verify, then the traitors can be eliminated. Sometimes traitors and mediocrities are confused. But it is intentional to be a traitor, unintentional to be a mediocre. In this time of life and death, small talents cannot be used for great purposes, and mediocre people cannot be retained for long.</p>

<h3 id="e53">The New Task of National Assistance in the War of Resistance: A Commando Team for Developing the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement! <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>There are three optimistic phenomena in the current situation: first, the exposure of Wang Jingwei's conspiracy of colluding with and betraying the country can reduce major obstacles and traps on the road to national unity and sustained resistance in the future. It has also blocked the cliff and dead end of running to the fascist anti-communist line of Germany and Italy to become an accomplice; second, the fall of the Konoe Cabinet in Japan and the establishment of the Hiranuma Cabinet more clearly expose the Japanese fascist invaders' determination to destroy the entire China, and their determination to establish a "New Order" in East Asia. This has strengthened China's determination to resist to the end, and also determined that the only way for democratic and peace-loving countries to defend themselves is to unite to aid China and contain Japan; third, the policies of Britain and the United States towards the Far East are gradually becoming more active, and the establishment of huge credit loans from Britain and the United States to China is a pioneering move by peaceful and democratic countries such as Britain and the United States to more actively implement aid to China and contain Japan. Taken together, these three recent facts prove that the future of our united resistance is very optimistic, and the future of world peace has faintly revealed the dawn of light. In particular, the credit loans from Britain and the United States to China, on the one hand, prove that our heroic resistance in the past year and a half has not been in vain. We have glorified the excellent and great traditions of the Chinese nation, and we have enhanced the international status of the Republic of China; on the other hand, it has especially promoted our national self-esteem and self-confidence, overcoming pessimistic emotions, smashing compromise psychology, and moving towards a bright future of heroic struggle.</p>
<p>Because we understand, why do Britain and the United States lend to our country? First, it is due to our year and a half of heroic resistance and our firm determination to resist to the end. Second, it is due to the progress of the united front of all parties and circles in China against Japan. In a year and a half, we have successively overcome the conspiracies of the Japanese invaders and traitors to alienate, divide, compromise, and mediate. We have successively overcome many difficulties in military, political, and even economic matters, so that the great powers of Britain and the United States recognize that the power of the Chinese people united is infinitely great, recognize that the Chinese National Government is fully equipped with the power to unite the whole country and persist in the war of resistance, and recognize that China has a future; third, it is due to our government's national policy of self-reliance and striving for foreign aid. Because of self-reliance, all external debts are planned and methodical, which can further strengthen the trust of the great powers; because of striving for foreign aid, the great powers are unwilling to let go of the priority, glorious opportunity to benefit others and themselves; fourth, it is due to the development of Japan in the Far East, which has gradually proved that its conflict of interests with European and American powers, especially the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, Belgium, and the Netherlands, is irreconcilable, and Britain and the United States have also begun to cooperate based on their own and mutual interests. Britain and the United States have gradually advanced their steps to aid China and contain Japan for the above four reasons—at the same time, it cannot be ignored that, due to American aid to China, it will inevitably affect France more, and especially provide the Soviet Union with more convenient conditions to further aid our country—the recent situation between Japan and the Soviet Union caused by the fishery negotiations, of course, makes people miss the socialist Soviet Union as a "true friend", and in the construction and strategic counter-offensive preparations in our western rear, it goes without saying that the Soviet Union is doing its utmost to provide the most loyal and enthusiastic legal aid!</p>
<p>Under this new situation, especially under the situation where international friendly nations are helping us in the war of resistance and national reconstruction, how should we encourage each other to do our best to help the government in the war of resistance and national reconstruction! The "One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement" that was published by Mr. Xu Jun in the Shanghai Da Mei Wan Bao and is gradually spreading to various places can be regarded as the best answer to the question raised by the people above—on February 17, the Shanghai Chinese Da Mei Wan Bao published that the reader Xu Kehe, in view of the serious national crisis, and the fact that the United States and Britain have provided loans to help China, was overjoyed and initiated the "One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement" to show the sincerity of the Chinese people in supporting the government, and to strengthen the international community's determination to help China. Later, Zhang Wanxin, a reader of the newspaper, contributed her opinions on the debt repayment movement, believing that "this donation can be presented to the central banks in various places, and before the British and American loans are due, the government can use this donation to expand the work of resisting the war and building the country. This is of great benefit to the government's finances, and there will be no shortage of resources for the war of resistance and wartime construction." Later, not only Shanghai citizens responded enthusiastically, with considerable results, but also as far as this port, this one-dollar repayment movement has also been enthusiastically launched. Now various overseas Chinese groups in this port are working hard on this. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to celebrities to raise donations, and the Teachers' Union is leading students to participate. This is truly a gratifying phenomenon. Even a certain foreigner was moved by hearing about it and donated two yuan out of righteousness—however, we should also especially point out the important significance of the one-dollar debt repayment movement here. First, vigorously launching this movement can improve the enthusiasm of the people across the country to help resist the war; it can prove that the people across the country consciously and resolutely support the war and support the government; it can make the vast masses who are unwilling to be slaves become an irresistible tide of assistance to the war of resistance. The Japanese fascist aggressors will not be able to withstand the washing of our upsurge—secondly, vigorously launching one yuan can also strengthen the relationship of close cooperation between the government and the people, and break the alienation and separation of pro-Japanese traitors, national traitors, and Trotskyites. If the people trust the government and the government relies on the people, then we can truly say: "The enemy cannot be destroyed"—Third, more obviously, this movement can increase the government's determination to persist in the war of resistance and enhance the government's prestige in the international arena; especially at this time when the conspiracy of traitors such as Wang Jingwei has been exposed and they are using all kinds of conspiracies to weaken the government's prestige, the vigorous progress of this movement has its great significance—Fourth, the development of this movement can also enhance the friendly assistance of international peace-loving people and peace-loving democratic countries to China, especially the Soviet Union. We should be very clear here that our vigorous launch of the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement is a sacred and urgent task to help the government solve difficulties and strive for the early arrival of victory in the war of resistance!</p>
<p>Every Chinese citizen who is unwilling to be a slave should be invigorated under the call of the sacred and urgent task. We hope that the public opinion circle will strengthen this call and develop the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement as the most important work at present, awakening, organizing and guiding our compatriots with blood and backbone around us to enthusiastically participate in this movement; at the same time, we hope that all sectors will recognize the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement as the new task of national assistance in the war of resistance and national reconstruction. For this sacred and urgent task, we should each establish and develop a commando team for the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement from all groups such as workers, peasants, youth, women, businessmen, freelancers, students, cultural figures, children, and fellow villagers' associations, etc., and participate in it with great excitement and enthusiasm, and hold glorious competitions regularly—we want every sector, every group, and every region to produce the most glorious era heroes who win the championship!</p>

<h3 id="e57">Chen Bijun Arrives in Hong Kong Yesterday <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday (7th), a Guangdong ship arrived in Hong Kong from Haiphong. Reporters boarded the ship for investigation. According to a crew member, the ship carried more than seventy Chinese and Western passengers. However, after the ship set sail, it was discovered that Wang Jingwei's wife, Chen Bijun, was also among them. She remained hidden in her cabin all day long, never taking a step out, as if afraid of being discovered. She even ate her meals huddled in a corner of the room. After the ship docked in Hong Kong, only a few women were seen arriving by motorboat to greet her, and they disappeared in an instant. Their whereabouts were extremely secretive. The crew member spoke of this vividly. Reporters continued to investigate at the purser's office, but did not find Mrs. Wang's name on the passenger manifest. Therefore, it is suspected that she must have used an alias.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chongqing on the 7th] Political sources say that there are four major reasons for Wang Zhaoming's departure this time: (1) His consistent policy of seeking peace was not adopted by the highest authorities, so he would rather risk universal disapproval and directly contact the Japanese to issue absurd telegrams. (2) He attempted to use some of the councilors to attack a certain president of the Yuan, wanting to expand his influence and replace the president, but was severely corrected by the highest authorities at an expanded memorial week at the front. (3) When the central government decided to transfer a certain provincial chairman, Wang immediately telegraphed the authorities to recommend his long-time subordinate, Mr. Mou, to concurrently hold the post. As a result, he did not receive a reply, and the appointment of Mr. Mou, who was famous throughout the country for the Battle of De'an, had already been announced. (4) Wang advocated the death penalty for Chairman Zhang Zhizhong of Hunan Province, and issued absurd remarks on the Changsha fire, severely criticizing the scorched earth policy he had previously advocated, which greatly dissatisfied the military.</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Since Wang's telegram was issued, newspaper vendors in Hong Kong have regarded Wang's mouthpiece as a traitorous newspaper and unanimously refused to sell it. The public, incensed by righteousness, , , . In addition, the ×× Weekly and ×× Editorial Department, which are affiliated with the newspaper and were originally run by Fan ×× and Mei ××, etc., received a monthly subsidy of 6,000 national currency from the central government. After Wang's telegram was issued, the central government immediately ordered them to cease operations and await orders for a resolution. After receiving the order, Fan and others immediately distributed the December funds as severance pay.</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Foreign reports state that Wang Zhaoming is scheduled to issue a statement yesterday. According to sources, the matter was still under consideration yesterday, and it is uncertain whether it will be issued.</p>
<p>The Supreme Authorities Determine a New Military Plan, and the Military Command Issues Separate Orders to the Commanders-in-Chief of the Various Special War Zones; Local Changes in Party and Government Officials</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chongqing on the 7th] After the Supreme Authorities returned to Chongqing from a certain location, they have determined a new military plan, and the Military Command has separately telegraphed orders to the parties concerned to comply.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chongqing on the 7th] The Military Command announced that, in addition to the various war zones, Yu Xuezhong and Shen Honglie have been specially appointed as the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Su-Lu Special War Zone, and Lu Zhonglin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha Special War Zone. In addition, Shi Yousan's troops have entered × Province and are under × command. Shi will be appointed as the Chairman of Chahar Province.</p>

<p>[United Press, Shanghai, 7th] According to unconfirmed reports, Chinese troops attacked Hangzhou during the New Year and crossed the Qiantang River at Liangjiaqiao (transliteration), ten miles from Hangzhou, and attacked Hangzhou from all directions. The Japanese side admits that Hangzhou's connection with the outside world has been almost cut off. The Chinese army launched this offensive with a total of 8,000 men, including 6,000 shock troops. The Japanese army countered with three regiments, so the battle at that time was extremely fierce and is still raging. The Japanese army also dispatched planes to bomb the Chinese army's lines.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 7th] According to recent reports from here, Chinese troops have been attempting to recover Hangzhou for several days. The 63rd Division crossed the Qiantang River at a point 15 kilometers southwest of Hangzhou and joined forces with a certain unit from the western route.

<h3 id="e61">Zhao Baoyuan's Puppet Troops Telegraph Defection: Three Thousand Brave Soldiers Harbor Lofty Aspirations; Weapons Carried Sufficient to Terrify the Enemy <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Special Chongqing Airmail Dispatch) According to a Shandong radio dispatch on the 2nd, Zhao Baoyuan's troops, stationed in Jiaodong, were originally from the Northeast Army. Recently, they were ordered to enter the pass and were dispatched to Shandong to fight. Zhao's troops, totaling over three thousand men, had long harbored the determination to serve the country. On December 18th, taking advantage of their deployment to Jiaodong, they resolutely defected, and all Japanese personnel in their unit were shot. They immediately telegraphed Shandong Province Chairman Shen Honglie, requesting permission to defect, and in the name of the defecting army, telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and all military and political circles in the country, as well as overseas Chinese, expressing their determination to save the nation and kill the enemy. Chairman Shen replied approvingly and awarded them five thousand yuan as encouragement. (Already noted in this newspaper's special dispatch). After Zhao's troops defected, the military strength of Shandong Province greatly increased, and many puppet troops contacted them about defecting. The enemy was extremely panicked. The full text of Zhao Baoyuan's telegram is recorded below: To Chairman Shen, forwarded to Chairman Chiang, and all national military and political leaders, organizations, and overseas Chinese: Since our army fell into the puppet state of the Northeast, we have always harbored hatred and animosity towards the enemy, and always harbored the ambition to restore our homeland. However, due to the harsh environment, although under the iron heel and subjected to repeated trampling, we had to endure and wait for the opportunity. Fortunately, this spring, we were transferred into the pass. With the nation in distress and the great task of saving the nation at hand, we have an unshirkable responsibility. Therefore, on December 18th, we raised the banner of righteousness and resolutely defected. Three thousand brave soldiers harbor lofty aspirations, and the weapons we carry are sufficient to terrify the enemy. We will restore the descendants of the Yellow Emperor and reveal our true faces. From now on, under the leadership of our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, our troops will be determined to save the nation with our lives and thoroughly annihilate the enemy. We will sacrifice ourselves for the country and fight the war to the end. As long as we have a breath left, we vow to fight the Japanese to the death. We still hope that our comrades across the country will provide absolute assistance. Then, our army will surely bravely kill the enemy and restore our homeland as soon as possible to thank the people of the country. With an urgent telegram, we await your orders. Shandong Defecting Army Commander Zhao Baoyuan, leading all officers and soldiers, respectfully bows. (Sent on January 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e63">The Enemy's Military Personnel Speak Arrogantly, Vainly Claiming to Transform the World; Their Advocacy of a Hundred-Year War in Various Newspapers Is Shocking to the Public <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo, 7th] The newspapers of the Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an article today signed by Lieutenant General Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Army, entitled "Japan's Hundred-Year War," which greatly shocked the public. The article stated that the China Incident has entered a period of long-term war, but after this war is resolved, there will be an epoch-making political change in the world. The completion of this task will require a century or two. Therefore, Japan is now preparing for a hundred-year war to transform the world according to the methods of the Japanese Empire. Japan sacrifices for peace, eliminates the power of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and replaces it with Japanese military preparations to deal with the Soviet Union. Japan's great victory over Russia in 1905 was the starting point for transforming the world's new order. The weaknesses of Western culture led to the World War and the emergence of Bolshevik Russia. The ideas of Germany and Italy are the dawn of the revival of Western culture, and the Anti-Comintern Pact is an extremely strong driving force for transforming the new world. Historically and factually, Japan is the only country in the world that can save the misfortunes of various countries. How to transform the world can be seen in Japan's handling of international affairs. New history cannot overshadow new brilliance.</p>

<p>[Local News] The enemy's interference with the transportation of military supplies on the Burma Road has failed, and a large number of special agents have gone to Burma to bribe local tribal people. British authorities have dispatched a regiment of troops to protect the line along the way, so at present, the Burma Road is running smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Cabinet Changes in Japan Closely Watched by the United States: If New Cabinet's Policies Do Not Change, Resolve to Consider Harsher Steps <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 7th] Officials here have declined to comment on the new Japanese cabinet but are still watching it closely. The Japanese methods of monopolizing Manchuria and mainland China discriminate against the interests of American residents. In addition, Japan refuses to return the property of many American residents. This clearly violates the principle of the Open Door Policy, which Japan claims to respect, and the Nine-Power Treaty. The observers here are deeply impressed by President Roosevelt's statement in his message to Congress that the United States should take stronger steps, in addition to verbal protests, to deal with aggressor nations. It is believed that although President Roosevelt did not explicitly mention Japan, in fact, this statement is another hint to Japan. There have been frequent changes in the Japanese cabinet recently, but there has been no significant change in Japanese policy as a result. Therefore, the authorities here have very little expectation that relations between Japan and the United States will improve during the Hiranuma cabinet. Although successive Japanese governments have had different political views, in fact, apart from the increasingly strong tendency of successive prime ministers towards dictatorship, there has been no benefit to improving relations between Japan and the United States. According to impartial observers, if the new Japanese cabinet continues its past policies or its attitude towards the United States becomes even more rigid, then the American government will consider retaliatory measures.</p>

<h3 id="e68">New Year's Day in Xindu <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing Special Airmail Dispatch] The hardest thing to see in Chongqing in winter is the sun. On New Year's Day of the 28th year [of the Republic of China], the weather was clear and like early spring, and the sun shone brilliantly. Bright red national flags fluttered in the wind in front of or in the windows of every household. The pedestrians on the road, shoulder to shoulder, puffed out their chests and were full of smiles, all celebrating our New Year's Day of resistance, which also symbolizes the bright future of our nation's resistance and nation-building!</p>
<p>At ten o'clock in the morning, the open-air music concert in the park's tennis court opened. The concert was hosted by the China Film Studio. In addition to all the male and female actors of the studio performing songs, the military band of the Xingying was also invited to participate in playing military music. In the center of the court was a stage that could accommodate twenty or thirty people. The participating crowd was about ten thousand people. The chairman was Mr. Guo Moruo. The main point of his speech was, "Today, there are 700,000 people in this city, 70 million people in the entire province of Sichuan, and 450 million people in the country, all enthusiastically celebrating our New Year's Day of the 18th year. In this enthusiastic celebration, we should complete at least two tasks: First, overthrow Japanese imperialism; second, build a peaceful and happy new China. How can we complete these two tasks? That is to dedicate everything we have to the country. Now, the Japanese are at the end of their rope, and we can take advantage of this opportunity to give them a 'Surrounded on All Sides' situation." "Next year, we will celebrate New Year's Day in Nanjing." After a brief pause in the enthusiastic applause, the singing began.</p>
<p>First was military music. The program performed was the German Cavalry March. The tone was melodious and contained a solemn atmosphere in the calmness. Next, all the actors of the China Film Studio began to sing according to the scheduled program, including "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Crimson Earth," "War for the Motherland," "Go to the Front Line," "Artillery Song," "Recover Our Lost Land," "The Great Wall Ballad," "Go to the Battlefield," etc. After each section was performed, the crowd around the court shouted in unison, "Again!" "Again!" However, time did not wait for us. Noon had already arrived, and the conference closed with the melodious military music.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, a conference with a dual meaning—celebrating the New Year and promoting resistance and nation-building—began at Fuzichi. The square was divided into distinct areas, and the participating groups were assigned their respective positions. The civilians and schools were on the left, and the party and government organs and military police were on the right. As early as two o'clock, the groups had come one after another in a mighty manner, preparing for the torchlight parade following the end of the conference. Each team held lanterns in their hands, and the styles of the lanterns were colorful: dragon lanterns, pagoda lanterns, lanterns in the shape of various fruits, and lanterns in the shape of characters. When the lanterns were combined, they formed complete slogans, such as "Military-Civilian Cooperation" and "Resist to the End." When the dragon lanterns arrived at the square, they beat gongs and drums and danced into the square. Those who acted as the dragon dancers were dressed as Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie. Although it was already the cold winter season, they were still waving large banana leaf fans in their hands as they led the dragon, and their excitement was unprecedented in Sichuan Province. This proves that the Chinese nation has been invigorated under the enemy's artillery fire and has grown stronger in the process of striving to resist the war.</p>
<p>The conference opened with the sound of artillery and music. Mayor Jiang led the ceremony as chairman and reported the significance of the meeting. Then, a representative of the Central Propaganda Department raised two points for everyone to pay attention to: "One is to strengthen your belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, and the other is to intensify your own work, that is, those who have money should contribute money, and those who have strength should contribute strength." In addition, Guo Fu representative Lu Canjun stated, "The result of eighteen months of resistance has laid a solid foundation for our nation-building. On the foundation built with flesh and blood, we must make three resolutions at the beginning of this year: First, everyone must take on the great cause of nation-building; second, we must do our best to promote the revolutionary spirit of the Prime Minister; and third, we must increase the efficiency of our work in the future. Only in this way can we shorten the distance to our final victory." (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhuangju</p>
<p>East and West Guling: Transforming the Enemy into Graveyards</p>
<p>After our army retreated from Majieling, Xingzi successively fell into enemy hands, and the focus of the war on the west bank of Poyang Lake shifted to East and West Guling. East and West Guling are located between Xingzi and De'an. The enemy's attempt to attack from this direction was twofold: first, to cut off the retreat route of the Majieling troops to Nanchang; and second, to join forces with the enemy troops in Majieling to attack De'an from both sides. However, our military authorities had long seen through the enemy's cunning plan and ordered General Ye Boqin to repel the enemy in the area between East and West Guling and Jinlun Peak, preventing the enemy from advancing an inch.</p>
<p>On September 7th, an enemy regiment attacked our army's position at Guling, engaging in a fierce bloody battle, killing countless enemies. Unexpectedly, the enemy became enraged and, at dawn the next morning, used a large amount of poison gas. After our army suffered this major blow, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, it retreated from East Guling to West Guling.</p>
<p>The terrain of West Guling is about 200 meters lower than that of East Guling. After the enemy occupied East Guling, they constantly posed a major threat to us. However, our loyal and brave soldiers, advancing one after another and regarding death as returning home, held out for twelve days, annihilating two enemy regiments. Our army, having completed its mission, then moved to a new position.</p>
<p>After retreating from East and West Guling to Aikou, the enemy repeatedly reinforced their troops and attacked with their superior weapons. We fought fiercely with the enemy in Shanjia Mountain, Guizong Temple, Jinlin Street, Husizui, Zhaoxianguan, Rongjia Mountain, Huzhuang, Jinlong Temple, Jinlun Peak, and other positions. Among them, the battle of Jinlun Peak was the fiercest. On September 27th, the enemy concentrated their main force to attack Jiaojian, the northern end of Jinlun Peak. However, the area was about "a thousand feet" from the sea. The enemy had to climb step by step to advance, while our army was hidden around, and as soon as the enemy arrived, they launched a fierce artillery attack and formed a dense fire blockade on the enemy's retreat route. At this time, the enemy was at a loss whether to advance or retreat, and the enemy soldiers fell one after another as if they were fallen leaves in the west wind. Jiaojian became the enemy's graveyard. After resisting for half a month, the Aikou position of our army lost its military value and there was no need to defend it to the death, so on October 9th, our army automatically retreated to the rear.</p>
<p>On the Ruiwu Line: A Great Annihilation War</p>
<p>The areas of Shuijie and Wanjialing are located between the Nanchang-De'an and Ruiwu lines, starting from Minshan in the north and ending at Xiuhe in the south, all of which are mountainous areas. The war started on September 25th and ended on October 16th. The most amazing performance during this period was the annihilation war near Wanjialing.</p>
<p>Since the end of August, the enemy had been using Ruiwu as a base and had been advancing south along the Ruiwu Highway with a part of their forces. By September 25th, the vanguard had reached the vicinity of Baishui. It was found that the enemy forces were the 123rd and 145th Regiments, the 52nd Mountain Artillery Regiment, the Miyazakitomio Regiment of the Fengjiu Corps, the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the China Garrison Army, and a part of the so-called North China Dispatch Army, totaling about 23,000 people.</p>
<p>Qilinfeng was the key to this position, and the enemy's main force first attempted to attack it and used poison gas, causing the position to be lost and regained twice, but the enemy suffered four battalions of casualties, especially the Miyazakitomio Regiment, which was almost completely annihilated. At the same time, our army intercepted the enemy at other locations such as Fuxueshan, Ma'anshan, Lishan, Wanjiacao, and Hejiashan, beheading a total of 2,000 enemies, and the captured military supplies were piled up like mountains.</p>
<p>In order to rescue the critical situation in Baishui Street, the entire 106th Division of the enemy attempted to break through our position in the area of Wanjialing, Changling, and Zhanggushan west of De'an, using a roundabout tactic to capture De'an, the vanguard of Nanchang, and then annihilate our entire force of resistance on the Nanchang-Xunyang Line, in order to relieve the state of Baishui. Unexpectedly, our side detected their conspiracy. Commander-in-Chief Xue Yue immediately convened a meeting of senior generals on the front line, and after careful planning day and night, redeployed the entire line, dividing the troops into several routes, tightly surrounding the two brigades led by the enemy General Matsuura (one was the Aokibrigade and the other was the Yamajibrigade, totaling about 10,000 people) in Wanjialing, Laohujian, Shimakang, Zhoujia, Jincun, Bijijie, and other places. Attacking each other, the sound of guns and cannons and the sound of killing shook the valleys. Especially the brave troops organized by each division charged forward, making the enemy feel even more overwhelmed. At this time, although the enemy planes came in groups to fly low and provide support, and sprinkled poison gas, they could not reverse Matsuura's tragic defeat.</p>
<p>The completion of this annihilation war was just in time for the Double Tenth Festival last year. The news of the great victory in De'an, which was printed in special large font headlines in newspapers across the country, refers to this, and it can be said to be worthy of the name "Second Taierzhuang."</p>
<p>The Great Victory in De'an: Transferring the Position to Xiuhe</p>
<p>De'an is a small city on the Nanchang-Xunyang Line. After being repeatedly bombed by enemy planes, it has become a dead city of scorched earth. The streets are desolate and sparsely populated, and even travelers cannot find food to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>The enemy had been painstakingly planning to seize De'an as a stronghold for attacking Nanchang for several months, but because our army resisted effectively in Majieling and other places, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, the battle for De'an did not begin until October 24th. According to intelligence, the enemy's attacking forces were one regiment of the 101st Division, and the remnants of Matsuura's 106th Division.</p>
<p>On the 24th, the enemy repeatedly used planes and cannons to coordinate with infantry to forcibly cross the river north of De'an, but they were all defeated by our army's heavy blows. When the enemy could not do anything, they heavily used poison gas to attack, causing our river-guarding troops to suddenly lose their resistance. Taking advantage of the gap, the enemy crossed the river, and our army immediately launched a fierce bloody battle with the enemy in the area of Xiong Zhuang, Xin Fo Temple, Ni Shi Cliff, Tiger Mountain, and Yi Feng Mountain. The enemy abandoned corpses and weapons, filling the mountains and roads, but our side also suffered many casualties. Regiment Commander Chai Jingzhong and two or three battalion commanders also heroically sacrificed their lives.</p>
<p>Street battles were launched in De'an city from the 27th to the 30th. Because the enemy army used planes and cannons to assist in the battle, and released poison gas smoke, they were able to repeatedly break into the city, but they were driven out by our army like rats. All the soldiers and officers embraced the purpose of coexisting with the city, and would never easily give up an inch of land unless it was absolutely necessary, and they had to demand a great price from the enemy. One day, our army lured dozens of enemy soldiers into a large house, and at the same time, in the gaps between the adjacent wall and the roof, violently threw dozens of hand grenades down.
