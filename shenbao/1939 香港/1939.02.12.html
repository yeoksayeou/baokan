<h3>我國抗戰的前途</h3>
<p>— 劉震寰</p>
<p>自廣州淪陷，武漢有計劃放棄後，關於抗戰的前途，國人頗多揣測。有常識的都曉得×人愈深入，於我愈有利，戰面愈擴大，×人力量愈分散，愈感困難，不獨不存悲觀，而且認爲是一個抗戰必勝的前途。但是一直到現在爲止，仍然有少數恐日病者乘着我們軍事上的小挫折，繼續在散布失敗主義者的流言，企圖動搖我中樞抗戰的决心，把我們神聖的民族解放鬥爭，變爲妥協投降，因而他們得以在日本帝國主義武力的掩護之下，建立傀儡政權，這是値得我們注意的！我寫這篇論文，也就是爲了要從各方面給與這個問題一個明白而正確的解答。</p>
<p>自然，我們的抗戰在其繼續進行中，還存着許多艱難困苦的因素，尤其是從表面上看來，我們還好像困扼在狠大的危機中。但是，問題决不是這樣簡單：中日戰爭的勝負，决不能從表面上看出，必須要從這兩個民族的社會和經濟的結搆的對比才可以决定；而且也不是中日兩國自身的對比可以孤立的决定，必須要把戰爭聯系到國際政治經濟的傾向上，才可以得到最後的决定。這就是說，我們不能從形式上去估計這個戰爭，必須要從實質上去估計。我們不能把中日戰爭從世界關係中孤立去玫察，而必須把牠當作世界關係的全體中的一個部分去攷察，然後才能得到一個正確的認識。</p>
<p>第一，我們從這次抗戰的性質上說，我們這次抗戰旣不是爲了少數封建軍閥的利益而發動的封建性的內戰，也不是爲了少數資本家的利益而發動的帝國主義的火併，而是全中華民族每一個人民爲了自己的生存，國家的生存，和種族的生存，而發動的民族解放的革命戰爭。而日本則恰恰相反，爲了少數資本家及地主的利益，驅使大批的勞動大衆，直接間接走上死亡線的侵略戰爭，侵略戰爭愈延長，則將由子廣大的勞動羣衆之覺醒，而愈不能支持，以至達到戰爭之必然的失敗。反之，我們反侵略的民族革命戰爭，則人民愈覺醒，愈英勇去抗戰，愈能保證最後的勝利。關於這一點，過去的土耳其的實例，確切袖證明了。中國在今後已漸漸克服以前的弱點，這種力量的長成，是不成問題的。事實證明了，這十幾個月的抗戰已經表示了我們民族空前未有的覺醒，造成了我們民族空前未有的大團結，形成了我們國家政權和國家軍隊的統一，提高了我們民族最後勝利的自信心，堅强了我們將士犧牲到底的精神，而且也相當地打擊了××××××與卑鄙的夢想，幷由此而獲得了全世界的勞動大衆及愛好和平的國家同情與援助。這些都是從我們民族自力更生中所發揮出來必勝的證明。</p>
<p>第二，我們的國際環境，現在也算一天一天的向着有利的方向發展。在這幾個月來，我們從各方面都可見到許多有利於我們的事實在蓬蓬勃勃的發展，我們歸納這些事實可以分爲幾個方面：（甲）各國的勞動大衆及各國的進步政黨的反日運動之國際化，他們不僅在經濟上使日×的商品到處受到打擊，並且拒絕起卸，在政治方面極力督促他們的政府，對日實施有效的制裁。這些運動，首先發動於英國及英領各殖民地，現在已經普遍到全世界——德意除外——的任何地域。去冬倫敦舉行偉大的反侵略國際大會，便是全世界愛好和平的人民對侵略主義之總示威。（乙）全世界愛好和平的民主政治國家，如英美法，他們自從美總統羅斯福有名的演講發表以後，卽漸漸放棄孤立政策和觀望態度，形成了一個反侵略主義的國際和平陣綫。他們深知和平不能分割，要保證世界的和平，就要保證遠東的和平，所以他們曾經幾次運用國際聯盟這一集體安全的機構，以及特別召開九國會議，以爲中國聲援。接速不久英國又舉行新嘉坡海軍會操，美國跟着决議擴充軍備，這些事實，都是間接給中國一個聲援。至於蘇聯方面，他在本質上，就是中國最誠摯的友人，是支持人類和平最强的堡壘，他對于中國民族解放的革命戰爭的支持，是他一貫不變的立場。中蘇互不侵犯條約之訂立，就給日×多一層顧慮。此外，他運用一切外交手段强化集體安全制度；鞏固和平陣線，幷普遍的發動全世界的勞動大衆和前進的政黨，對中國抗戰子以精神和物質上的支持。他遠東的在軍隊，在張鼓峯之役。已給日×一個巨創，此外德意雖然直接接在間援助日×，但有英法美蘇的牽制，也不能有所作爲，而且在他們之間，也存在着相互的矛盾。日×侵略中國，一旦超過了他們所希望的限度，侵略陣線的本身，也不是沒有瓦解的可能。（丙）各殖民地的民族對中國之同情與援助，也一天一天更普遍了。比如南非聯邦及澳洲，尤其是印度與荷屬南洋羣島，他們發動對日經濟制裁，使日×的外國貿易幾乎陷于停止。他們深知中國抗戰的勝利，是××地革命成功有力的一個前提，中國的解放是世界××地解放運動最重要的一環。綜合上面幾點，我們可以認識而且可以相信，我們是在一個絕對有利的國際環境中鬥爭。這種鬥爭之取得勝利，是狠有把握的。况英美最近信用担保借欵成立，是明明表示援助我們不許日本獨霸東亞，若日×仍不覺悟，也許英美法蘇會聯合起來，實行制裁這個强×國家！</p>
<p>第三，我們再把我們的×人詳細分析一下：日×在表面上看來，好像是一個堅强的資本主義國家，但是若是仔細分析他的內容，我們卽刻可以看出他是一個先天不足的一個脆弱的國家。他缺乏一切建設『侵略主義」的資源，他之所以能在短短幾十年中完成其資本主義國家的機構，完全是利用歷史的機會和地理的優勢，並且就在這些歷史機會中利用地理優勢拚命的進行掠奪戰爭，所以掠奪戰爭在日本資本主義的發展上算是盡了主要的任務。他首先在日俄戰爭和中日戰爭中獲得了大量的金錢賠償與土地割讓，作成了日本資本主義的基礎，後來他又利用世界大戰的機會把他自身超升到帝國主義的階段。</p>
<p>然而究竟日本資本主義還是國際資本主義國家最脆弱的一環。自從一九二九年起，世界資本主義經濟恐慌爆發以後，日本的經濟便陷于窮途末日，英美各國還可以用經濟政策解除其危機，日本便不够這個資格，他只有用×力來殺出一條血路。這就是他近年對中國侵略積極化的原因，也就是對中國發動這次大規模侵略的原因。他不知道這次的侵略，却遇着中國政府和人民一個血的囘答，他以爲在短期間就可以完成其征服中國的夢想，也决想不到　中國長期抗戰中，使他的國家經濟機構整個地陷于崩潰。由經濟的危機反映到政治的危機，×</p>
<p>我們知道日×的生存，完全是建築在中國的侵略上。然而自從戰爭開始以來，對中國的貿易便完全停止了，不僅對中國的貿易停止，對世界其他國家的貿易，也遭受了反侵略運動的嚴重打擊，而全部縮減。此外因戰爭而退還的定貨，在中國是百分之百，在南洋各地是百分之五十以上。這一筆對外貿易的出超，是完全沒有了。其次，對中國的巨大的投資，也完全在戰爭中被燬滅，如上海靑島漢口的日×的財產，都化爲灰燼。至工業方面，在日本國內只有軍事工業還在掙扎，其餘紡織等及金工業，或因原料來源發生困難，或因販路成了問題，大部分完全停閉，小部分也大大地縮減生產。而農業方面，更因鄉村之農民大多數被迫出征，減少了農業勞動人口，生產無法繼續增加，而且因爲工業的崩潰，影響到農業生產品無法出賣，又因現金流出，金匯動搖，國際貿易上差額的支付和軍需品購買，都需要現金支付；所以現金一天一天地流出，因而影響紙幣的跌價和一切有價證券的在落。尤其是工業的停閉後，失業的人數必然的一天擴大一天，紙幣低落後，市面的物價抬高，勞動者不是失業，便是減低工資，因而勞資衝突與罷工運動，一天天地加多。在另一方面，日本的資本家與軍閥，爲了戰爭之繼續進行，仍然不能不從貧苦不堪的農工身上盡量搾取。據我們所知道的，前年日本的預算已達到了五十四億七千萬元，而其中軍費的支出，佔總數百分之七十，現在還不止此。這樣巨大的數目，除了從日本的勞動大衆身上榨出來外，沒有第二個的來源了。現在日本的勞動大衆，已經搾無可搾了。總之，日本國家財政已經失去了强固的國民經濟的基礎，國家預算已超過人民所能担負的程度之上，公債和一切苛捐雜稅都達到了飽和點，再也不能消化了。所以搾取出來的金錢和物質，都已經搾取乾凈了，他已經失去了繼續戰爭的物質基礎，！</p>
<p>從以上的各方面總括的看來：第一，從中國抗戰的本身之自力更生上，第二，從中國抗戰的有利的國際環境上，第三，從我們×人之經濟與政治的危機上，我們抗戰的最後勝利之獲得，都是有把握的。不過我們僅僅依靠這些客觀的條件之發展，是不够的，要緊的，我們還是要在主觀上加以最大的努力。我們應該努力的：第一，是如何使我們的力量在抗戰的發展中生長起來，强壯起來，一切足以障碍這種自力更生的理論和行動，我們都必須一掃而空之。第二，我們應如何建立我們勝利的外交路線，急速與各國人民團體及前進的政黨聯系起來，推動他們去反對其政府的孤立政策，和搖擺不定的態度。第三，我們應如何與我們×國內部的被壓迫的勞動大衆取得聯系，强化他們的反戰運動，現在我們的抗戰已經走入了一個新的階段，這個階段，也可以說是一個接近於勝利的階段。由于過去一年半的失敗中，我們得了不少的寶貴的教訓，以前的種種失敗，作成了我們今後勝利的基礎，我相信我對于我們抗戰必勝的前途這一個估計，是一個正確的估計，只要我們一每個人都抱着爲民族解放而鬥爭這個决心，最後的勝利，一定是屬于我們的！</p>
<h3>潮汕的青年求亡運動</h3>
<p>— 張問強</p>
<p>沒有統一的組織也沒有統一的領導，這是過去潮汕靑救迷動的一個缺點。本來，潮汕靑年老早就有統一組織的要求，，去年』月曾在汕頭舉行一次各縣市靑抗會的代表大會，原定由代表大會產生嶺東靑年抗×同志繼會，但是，當時汕頭民衆抗×後援會，不知根據什麽理由，竟函請警察局制止開會。大會開不成，總會也產生不出，僅由各代表在一個非正式會議裘。推出三個人，組織嶺東靑年抗×同志會通訊處，作爲代替總會的組織。可是，由於組織過於簡單，那時的嶺靑通訊處也不能負起領導的責任，潮汕靑年依舊在散漫的情况下工作。</p>
<p>中國的政治跟着抗戰的開展而進步了。去年八一三紀念日，潮汕各地靑抗會代表大會居然在黨政軍長官領導之下舉行了。靑抗總會雖還未能組織成功，嶺靑通訊處的組織却健全起來了，成爲一個眞正的潮，靑救運動的領導機關。同時，各縣的靑抗會也統一起來了，由縣及區，由區及鄕都發生了隸屬的關係；鄉靑抗接受區靑抗的領導，區靑抗接受縣靑抗的領導，縣靑抗提受嶺靑通訊處的領導。潮汕靑救運動從此統一起來了。</p>
<p>培養幹部與分配幹部</p>
<p>「幹部决定一切」，這是一句含着眞理的名言，從豐富的革命鬥爭經騐中體味出來的。潮汕靑救運動的發展形態，是决定於幹部的。因此，在鬥爭中的潮汕靑年對於幹部的培養極其注意。</p>
<p>從鬥爭中鍛鍊出來的靑年，才能成爲一個堅强能幹的幹部。潮汕靑年向來就以實際的工作來培養幹部。一九三七年，組織了二個隨軍工作隊，一個是駐在潮汕的一五五師隨軍工作，一個是北上隨軍工作隊，跟一五六師開赴東戰場工作的。二個隨軍工作隊組織的目的，在負起軍民橋樑的責任，塡平過去軍民間的鴻溝，使軍民能够密切合作，一致奮起，消滅×人，同時也藉着隨軍的便利，更廣泛而深入地喚起民衆，組訓民衆，北上隨軍工作隊在南京失陷以後解散歸來。一五五師隨軍工作隊，自從去年二月一五七師接防潮汕，即改爲一五七師隨軍工作隊，至今年四月因爲經濟關係也宣吿解散了，以上兩個工作隊，其工作的成　固然是不可磨滅的，而每一個隊員都在工作中鍛鍊成爲堅强的幹部，是尤爲寶貴的收穫。</p>
<p>潮汕靑年，爲着要得到更豐富的鬥爭經騐，特鼓勵大批的同志到陜北的抗大去學習。到新四軍去，參加游擊戰。他們在西北，在江南，已從實際的鬥爭中，充實了經騐，加强了能力。潮汕的抗日戰爭需要他們的時候，他們是會囘來保衛家鄉的，因爲在家鄕工作更能發揮力量。</p>
<p>除從工作中培養幹部以外，潮汕靑年也能我緊每一個短期的特種訓練的機會。政府所舉辦的各種訓練班，如廣東黨政軍聯席會議的民運工作幹訓班，八區自衞團統率委昌辦事處的自衞人員幹訓所及婦女幹訓所，九區自衛團的敎導隊及一五七師戰地服務團，潮汕各地靑抗會都有計劃地派會員去參加訓練，使成爲有特種技能而且得政府信任的榦部。</p>
<p>靑抗會的會員參加各種榦部的訓練，另一個目的就是分配幹部。政府所舉辦的各種訓練班，其目的都在養成各項民運工作的榦部人材，畢業以後便分派到各地去工作。這樣便會把靑會的會員分散到各地去，站在合法的地位，直接領導廣大的民衆，切實執行政府的一切抗戰政令。</p>
<p>感覺到的困難</p>
<p>在一次的代表會議席中，聚集着潮汕各縣市幾十個靑抗會的代表，相互報吿各地靑抗會工作進行的困難情形。歸納起來大概有下列幾點：一封建勢力的阻礙；二幹部的缺乏；三經費的支絀。　（未完）</p>

<h3>×侵海南島　美政府極重視　國防專家研究西太平洋形勢　菲島關島設防計劃或將加強</h3>
<p>【美聯社華盛頓十一日電】據美國國防專家意見、倘日本在海南島建立海空軍根據地、則美國對菲島與關島設防之新計劃、應重新考慮、一般人相信、日軍此舉實足鼓勵美國人民對政府在關島設防、以保衞菲島之計劃更表同情、又據另一方面人士之意見、日軍此舉實欲要挾各國重行調整太平洋之形勢而停止中日戰事、或許日方欲藉此要挾美國停止關島設防、美國官方對日軍在海南島登陸之眞目的未明瞭時、不肯發表意見、蓋日軍是否的永遠占據該島、實一疑問也、倘日軍實行永遠佔據該島、幷在該島建立海空軍根據地、美國官方以爲菲島安南與香港各地、均將感受威脅、而西太平洋之軍事形勢將有重行調整之必要云、</p>

<h3>病逝前方的王德林老先生</h3>
<p>— 劉啓光</p>
<p>（西安航信）</p>
<p>提起王德林先生、誰也會立卽想到東北義勇軍、因爲他是當年東北義勇軍的四大領袖之一、而且他和馬占山蘇炳文李杜等由髙級軍官蛻化的義勇軍領袖不同、是從下層躍起振臂一呼、就獲得十餘萬不願做亡國奴的塞外健兒擁護的草莽英雄、他沒有讀過書、不懂政治、沒有架子、外表上是道地的鄕下老兒、對人是一位好好先生、對事却是一團火球、他不知道什麼叫做黨派、更不知道爲什麽要「兄弟鬩牆」、他祇知道、「咱是中國人啊、中國人應該愛中國」、如果有人侵犯了中國的利益、就是他的不共戴天之仇、當帝俄敷設中東路侵入中國的時候、他曾率部抗爭、閙得沙皇政府遣使求和而後已、可是俄人如有欺侮中國同胞的事情給他知道了、中東路的交通照例得發生障礙、後來他幫助布爾塞維克黨，消滅黑龍江對岸的白俄、惟一的動機、就是想乘機對欺侮中國人的帝俄實行報復、其實他並不知道布爾塞維克黨的政治立塲是什麽、更談不到贊成革命、他這大賦的愛國家愛同胞觀念、始終控制着他畢生的行徑、因此他雖然幹過十餘年的××、在黑龍江沿岸擁有雄厚的實力、但是當地的民衆始終沒有對他發生過反感、沙皇政府四季送給他的厚禮、不但作了他部下的給養、而且部份地成了當地貧民的衣食、九一八後他不顧一切奮起抗戰，也就是他天賦的愛國心最髙的表現、</p>
<p>這一位値得景仰的民族英雄、已經和四萬萬五千萬同胞水决了、他死於×人後方的游擊根據地、侍奉他臨終的是他親隨的四五十個不願做亡國奴的齊魯　兒、在部下的武裝戒備中、在×人的不斷威脅中、他結束了六十四歲的人生、當他在奄奄一息的時候、還喃喃地說、「×他的娘、×子兵一個也不讓他囘去、』</p>
<p>王先生死了、九一八後首先發動抗戰、爲國家爭生存、爲民族爭人格的王先生死了、可是他畢生爲國家民族奮鬥不懈的精神、將永垂不杇、繼承這偉大的精神遺產爲國家民族的獨立自由幸福而犧牲一切、應該是每一個後死的中華兒女無可旁貸的責任！</p>
<p>王德林先生開始抗日、是在九一八後一個月的光景、那時他是吉林省防軍的一個營長、駐防在吉林與朝鮮毗鄰延吉附近、×人進佔東北之後、爲着軍略上的需要、思欲開築由朝鮮會寧通至延吉的鐵路、而×人所預定的路綫恰巧通過王先生的防地、那時候×人還以爲中國人都可以用金編地位來收買、就派員詣王先生於防次、恭送大批禮物、幷許以吉會路完成後、昇王先生以「護路司令」之職、王先生佯爲允諾、翌日×軍二百餘人、保擭着測量隊開始測繪路綫、王先生乘×不備、調動所部將×人密密地包圍起來、燃放了抗戰的第一炮、而將二百多個×人盡作祭旗的犧牲、於是和『進剿』的×軍不斷開火、一直打到廿一年正月、×人不但不能消滅他的力量、反而把他由四五百人打成了七八萬人、王先生就在這個時候、被大家擁爲「中國國民救國軍總司令」轉戰於吉林境內、翌年冬天、他的隊伍已經增加到十五六萬、防地亦漸由吉東南被迫移向東北，終因軍火沒有接濟、戰士給養困難、在×人大舉進攻下敗入蘇境、王先生雖然失敗了、可是他領導下的十餘萬東北健兒、却仍化整爲零、留於東北各地、繼續抗戰、現在的東北人民　日聯軍領袖、如周××、李××、吳××、王××、等都是往日追隨過他的幹部、</p>
<p>廿三年六月、先生經由歐洲返國、所過之處、備受朝野熱烈歡迎、尤以南洋各屬僑胞爲甚、七月在廣州就任東北義勇軍總司令新職、九月離粵赴滬、奔走滬津等地、擬乘輪經海參威返東北、繼續領導抗戰、因種種關係未能成功、後奉委爲軍委會參議、栘京小住、然抗戰熱情、始終不懈、在京時曾二次親晤蘇聯大使、商請假道、未償所願、</p>
<p>王先生很窮、在南京的時候、他一家七口和十來個隨員擠在一座二十五塊踐一月的平房裏、日常生活、除了電委會九十幾塊錢一月的車馬費、就是東北救亡總會百五十元一月的津貼、廿五年冬天、隨他退入蘇境的舊部、由海參威源源歸來、都在先生寓所蓆地起居、送走了一批又來一批、簡直把他累得稀飯都喝不起、幸而後來歸國的舊部、都由軍委會代爲資送回籍、才得鬆了一口氣、</p>
<p>綏東戰事發生後、先生急得像熱鍋上的馬蟻一樣、一刻也不能安定、「×他的娘、××越來越兇了、難道中國人就那麽不爭氣嗎、×他的娘、咱得幹，不幹不中啦！」、他見到每一個朋友、總是這樣　　着，</p>
<p>他和馬相伯丁惟汾二先生交淸甚篤、後來也就在他們的資助下、帶了兩個隨員、趕到綏遠去、他原想由綏遠經熱河回吉林、領導舊部　應抗戰、等他趕到歸綏見過傳作養將軍、知道綏戰已在勝利中結束了、回東北的志願一時不能實現、這纔壓訪當時參加抗戰的官兵慰問後、快怏囘到北平來、</p>
<p>到了北平、經宋哲元先生的挽留、就在故都住了下來、並膺任冀察綏靖公署顧問、他在北平、曾派人回東北聯絡、而關外舊部、也常常派人入關報吿一切、那時候他還是千方百計想出關、可惜都沒有達到目的、</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事變後、他立卽派人囘山東招集塞外歸來的舊部、準備抗戰、可是出乎意料的平津棄守、竟把他老先生隔在北平、暴露於殘暴的××直接威脅之下、那時候他的朋友都認爲凶多吉少、多方奔走營救、但始終不知下落、後來他竟於九月度、化裝脫險回到南京來、</p>
<p>十月、東北××在鄭州成立、先生應陳××之敦促、出任第二××區光復軍總指揮、又一度準備出關殺×、惜××旋卽結束、先生的計劃又不得不延擱下來、</p>
<p>經過了無數次的失敗、他知道出關的志願等閑不能得償、而抗戰局勢又一天緊張一天、最後遂毅然决然放棄原來計劃由鄭州赴徐州馳回魯南沂水東故鄉、集台鄕間子弟和的北歸來的舊部、承接韓復渠放棄山東之後、開始游擊×人、這個時候的他、旣沒有正式的名義、又沒有一文的經費、完全以老百姓的資格、率領鄕人抗戰、日常主活，反爲部下及故鄉父老的供給、他的部下張×是一位勇敢善戰的猛將、在東北抗日的時候、曾經建立過隻身衝入×陣、生擒×隊長的奇勳、這一位虎將在魯南的游擊中、也曾有過轟轟烈烈的戰績、</p>
<p>徐州撤守後、石××將軍率部進駐魯南、適値先生以連年奔走抗戰、心力交瘁而得疾、乃將所部盡付張×、歸由石將軍直接指揮、而本人卽僅帶少數親隨回沂永南鄉北石莊親戚家中養疴、</p>
<p>先生之體本甚壯健、初到南京的時候、雖然已是六十一歲的暮年、還沒有一根白髮、司是因爲壯志不得酬、竟于半年之間、髮髮盡成斑白、而精神與肉體、亦漸覺不支、在魯南得疾後、雖則離軍休養、但終以年邁血喪、於去冬十二月廿日因宿疾轉劇而與世長辭了、</p>
<p>先生字惠民、廿歲時出關、在東北四十年、對於東北、尤其黑吉二省地理、知之甚詳、而該地父老、亦多與有交誼、夫人劉玉潔、生三子三女、均在稚年、現流亡於西安，寄寓于東大街六五三號、先生急公忘私、對於家庭生活從未計及、現一家六口、寡婦孤兒、至堪憫惻、甚望朝野士人憐其畢生與××搏鬥之民族英雄後裔、有以救助之、（一、二八寄於西安）</p>
<h3>專載　新的世界大戰（二）</h3>
<p>— 陳友仁</p>
<p>納粹的德意志，法西斯的意大利，和軍閥支配下的日本所要建立的帝國，祗在於英法兩帝國崩潰，蘇聯解體，中國整個被征服而滅亡，和美國在太平洋的海軍勢力被排除之後，然後有成功的可能。德意志已經吞併了奧大利，肢解了捷克，並且現在正和意大利同謀，使西班牙在一個時期冉受外族的支配，這種支配方式，是西班牙有史以來所未經見過的。意大利也征服了阿比西尼亞，幷强使英法在該兩國光榮的歷史所未曾有過的羞辱情態中，承認了意國所征服的土地：現在，因突尼斯，尼涉，直布底等問題積極準備。正式向法國挑釁。講到日本，他不但正在蹂躪中國，而且像末次所說，已在執行了一排斥亞洲的白人勢力的政策</p>
<p>這就是對於世界現狀的解釋。這解釋，可以使人們瞭解侵略國家的暴烈主義，和她們違法的思想與行動，及其對英法的輕蔑——某一侵略國也曾樂稱英法爲沒落的國家。</p>
<p>（六）確切的事實</p>
<p>侵略國家表面上的勝利，和英法政治家的措施失當，不能當機立斷，與其在外交上的屈辱，皆可以確切的專實來證明，當希特勒，莫索里尼和日本軍關已明目張胆，發動戰爭，且自防共協定簽訂以來，這戰爭，已成了新的世界戰爭，但在和平國家方面，反認這種動作爲偶然發生的外交事件，和局部的鬥爭，彼此之間，好像秦人視越人之肥　，毫無關係似的；是以在比京會議時，法外長迪波斯先生對於日本在中國所發動的慘酷的侵略戰爭僅僅稱它爲局部的鬥爭！</p>
<p>換句話來說，希特勒，莫索里尼，和日本的軍閥，不但正在發動世界戰爭，並且在他們的行動上與决斷上都已表現了歷史上軍事領袖的特長。然而倫敦巴黎和華盛頓方面，對於這已在進行中的戰爭，却不去想方法獲取勝利，現在，可憐的很，他們還是妄想避免戰爭！</p>
<p>作未來戰爭的準備，和在戰爭中，作攻擊的凖備，是不相同的。試舉例以證明這不同之點，前次世界大戰是一九一八年夏間發動的，但，協約國强迫德國求和的最後攻勢，不能說在一九一八年夏間以前，經已準備完成，協約國的最後反攻，經四年的時間來準備，而今德國髙爾玲將軍對於現時戰爭中極權國家的攻勢，已經從事於四年準備的工作，這是令人可驚奇而注意的事，依納粹與法西斯軍人的見解，這次戰爭，一定是突然發生，雙力勢力懸殊而在短期內就可以解决的。</p>
<p>（七）恐懼心理</p>
<p>民主國家不能把握着這新的世界戰爭的巨大現實，是否因前次歐戰，已經給予了英法兩國政治家以道德上或心理上的創傷，抑或大歐洲的民主國不能產生如希特勒，莫索里尼與東京幕府的軍閥一般的領袖？難道希特勒，莫索里尼和板垣輩眞是非常人所能企及的超人嗎？</p>
<p>不，希特勒與莫索里尼並不是特別的健全。不過當民主國家的領袖憎惡戰爭，和對戰爭發生極端恐佈的時候——其恐怖的程度，令他們對于自已不敢相信的事情，都認爲不足相信——希特勒等遂乘他人的錯誤，而得以踏進了歷史舞豪的主幕。</p>
<p>這種恐怖的心理，令到英法的政治家誤解了希特勒，莫索里尼，和日本軍閥們所造成的歷史事實，並且留然向他們建議了些甚麼「總解决」或「君子協定」和「國際會讓」之類，來討論他們所謂的不平的問題。希特勒等想用納粹的利刃，法西斯的飛機，和日本野蠻主義的方法來締造他們的新帝國。這締造新帝國的意志，當然不是外交的虛文，和政治的幻想所能支配。</p>
<p>（八）不干涉政策</p>
<p>人們的理智之受不道德行爲的打擊，有甚麽比英法對西班牙戰事採取不干涉政策這事還要厲害？德意軍隊、巳經侵入了西班牙，依莫索里尼的話，和最近美外長的演詞所稱，德意兩國軍隊的任務，在於覆滅民主的西班牙。但，在這兩年中，倫敦巴黎方面却都諱稱沒有這項軍隊存在，目的在証明他們所謂不干涉政策確能避免戰爭—實則若德意共同的力量，始終敵不了英法俄三大民主國共同的力量的時候，戰爭是不會發生的。</p>
<p>和上邊的評議同一目的，讓我來批評西方民主國家對日本入寇中國的態度。一年以前，我在巴黎演說，當時情不自禁，對聽衆說：「請諸君原諒我，我以中國人的立場，覺得西方民主國所採用的原則，是些鄙陋愚妄，自私自利的原則。不但英法如此，就是美國的政策，也是一樣，都以爲日本在中國的殘殺工作，僅僅是一不宣而戰的局部鬥爭，和他們的權益，是風馬牛不相及的。雖然是中國有三十萬以上的生命被日本的飛機大砲所殘殺，盈千累萬中國婦的女在上海馬路上和其他露天地點產生兒女，但，若英法美等國的權益不受損害的時候，不干涉的原則，是要遵守的。中國人所受的慘痛，實在是難以計算，除上述者外，據日本外部情報司長估計，在上海南京一帶，還有三千萬華人，當這嚴冬的時候。無家可歸，諸君想想；三千萬華人，等於全美人口四份之一，全法人口四份之三，爲殘酷的××所蹂躪，致令顚沛流離！」自從我在巴黎演說到現在，被日軍屠殺的中國人民，超過百萬，流離失所的，超過六千萬了。</p>

<h3>（上接自第三版）「新的世界大戰」</h3>
<p>（九）主要的防線</p>
<p>我繼續的說：「注意到日本入寇中國這方面，希望西方人們的心理和良心，對於遠東糾紛的實際重要性，有較爲眞確的驟識，不至認它爲局部的鬥爭，應當認它是新的世界戰爭的重要部份，認它爲這戰爭的主要防綫。這新的世界戰爭，就是德意日三國要以武力締造她們的新帝國而發動的戰爭」。</p>
<p>國際現狀下的一切事實，旣經閘述如上，我個人的意見，以爲這新的世界戰爭，現時仍在　釀的狀態中，在歐洲，實際的戰事，未至公然爆發，所以，我的建議是：如果要防阻這戰爭之由醞釀而變爲實際的公然爆發以我們就要當極權國家的攻勢未開始以前，立刻使她們在遠東的防線，崩潰解體。</p>
<p>我以爲不被征服的中國，是歐洲和平的一因素。中國現在缺乏的是軍械，但這些軍械，西方國家是可以供給的。中國人民有堅决抗戰的意志者。不止千數百萬，倘若西方國家以近代化的軍械接濟中國，在此消耗的戰爭中必能使日本疲於奔命而終於崩潰。旣被創弱或戰敗的日本，對於蘇俄之東方防線，就不至成爲可慮的戰爭成份，而蘇俄遂無東西兼顧之憂，旣無東西象顧之愛，又加上了美國無窮盡的戰鬥力量以協助英法，就可讓納粹的德意志和法西斯的意大利明白了戰爭仍屬不能實現其目的之一幻想。</p>
<p>（十）　西方主義</p>
<p>但反對的人們以爲歐洲的現實問題，不容許英法在中國或遠東有所行動，這見解，是歐戰時一種戰略的觀念之復現，這種觀念，延長了上次世界大戰的期間，如果不是美國干涉，賀欣佐蘭皇室統治下的德意志，或者因此而不會失敗。」</p>
<p>在前次大戰期中，法國人稱這觀念爲西方主義，我以爲如不說它是絕對防線的理論。這種理論堅决地中張，偏重西部防線。當時協約國的軍事專家和現實的政治家，多數主張這種戰略，而反對注重東部防線的理論。依據主張注重東部防線者的理論，以爲敵人的主力旣在西部，西部戰事固然必須獲得勝利，但以常識和健全的戰略而論，應該乘敵人的弱點，而攻其東部，以取得戰爭初期的勝利。這種理論，後來的忠實証明它是對的，福煦將軍後來在西部防綫之所以能克服敵人，係由於土耳其與巴加連軍力的崩潰，令到德國在東部軍力的受很大的影響而失敗所致，這是最無疑義的。</p>
<p>（十一）四國干涉</p>
<p>如果英法要在中國防線方面，對侵略國家加以干涉，不但可以保護他們帝國的權益，並且速帶着可以履行他們對中國的條約義務，侵略國家的力量，在中國防綫方面，實不如他們在歐洲防線，所以，如果俄國參加，共同干涉，則在任何干涉期間內，英法在歐洲的安全，都沒有甚麽危險。而且，如果英美法俄的行動，探取西國干涉的方式，亦大有可能。所謂四國干涉，就是共向對日本作有層次的要求，要求它停止在中國的屠殺，要求它參加華盛頓的國際會議，以解决遠東事件。</p>
<p>日本對這種要求，或許會加以拒絕，但殊未可必，日本領袖向強力屈服，在歷史上巳有三次。第一次，美國海軍將領，波雷强迫封建時代的日本，將全國開放，和各國通商，第二次在歐戰前，日本爲俄德法三國所干涉而屈服，交還遼東半島於中國，第三次在歐戰後華盛頓會議時，日本爲各方壓力所迫，放棄了山東。現在各國的安全，都是靠賴現存國際體制和世界均勢的維持，所以中國的政治家，如果能協助列强來造成四國的共同動作，日本會再向强力面作第四次之屈服，這，是很可能的。</p>

<h3>假使佛朗哥得勝了？！</h3>
<p>— 世長譯</p>
<p>Paul　Mc　Gufre原著節譯自本年二月號Parade雜誌</p>
<p>西班牙的戰爭已經進展到最後的階段，關心西戰的人們，顯然的已經把他們的注意，從軍事方面移轉到更重要的方面——建立新的西班牙，對於這個問題，即使竭力擁護佛朗哥的人，也表示焦念：新的西班牙究竟將採取怎樣的政體？它是否會採取像意大利的法西斯政體，或德意志的納粹政禮呢？，它將受意大利人或德意志人的統治嗎？這是西班牙戰後的重要問題，許多人會提出這種問題，當我到西班牙的時候，也想到這種種的問題，據我所能推得的答衆如下：</p>
<p>我不相信德國和意大利能够在短時期內統治西班牙，意大利參加西班牙戰爭的目的，是想制止共黨主義在西班牙的發展，當然四班牙政府軍的失敗，使意大利的政策獲得一個蠶要的勝利，德國參加西戰，帮助佛朋哥在西班牙商品生產和運輸方面，得到了很大的利益，但是我們仍舊不能看到意大利或德國能够統治西班牙，它們也許能够得到若干特權，例如開發礦業等，可是其他外國資本在西班牙投資的力量，非常重大而有影響（例如英國在里奧廷土（Rlo　Tfnto）和維加雅（Vizcaya）的勢力），西班牙是否歡迎擴充外國的投資，也是很成問題的，而且，佛朗哥在開始戰爭的時候，甚至於在其最沒有希望的時候，已堅决聲明决定保護西班牙領土的完整，不准任何他國佔據西班牙一寸的土地，西班牙人民竭力擁護這個聲明，我相信西班牙的國家主義必定會與盛起來，這種現象也許有好處，同時也有壞處，新的西班牙不是近幾世紀以來我們所熟悉的西班牙，這新的西班牙是有非常活躍的軍隊和文化的演進的。</p>
<p>我從西班牙所得到的最奇怪的現象是西班牙全國的人民，尤其是一般政務人員，對於重建西班牙問題非常注意，比較對於在繼續進行中的戰爭還要關心，西班牙人對於處理自己的事務有特殊的才能，戰爭是士兵的事情，政治官員的艱難工作，是建立新秩序，士兵的戰略和政治官員的施政，是有密切的關係的。</p>
<p>我們想到今後的新西班牙和它的政體，必定記得西班牙人民是非常渴望個人的自由的，藐視自由的政體决不能在西班牙出現，所以西班牙楚絕對不能法西斯主義化或是納粹主義化的，在復典西班牙的過程中，雖然不免要遭遇種種的失敗，但是從事於這復與工作的精神是堅决而純正的。所以西班牙的新秩序將採取像葡萄牙的政體，而不是像意大利或德國的政體方式，這是可以斷言的，西班牙人民知道這種新秩序必須從下層階級發展到上層階級，社會是漸漸的進步，而不是可以一旦製造的，雖然政府要指導或督促若干情事，但是必須鼓勵人民自動的發展他們的經濟組織，西班牙的政治機構，將像葡萄牙一樣漸漸的生長起來。</p>
<p>佛朗哥很明白的知道，他不能創立一種政治制度，强迫西班牙人民接受，他必須漸漸的培養某種政體的發展，使人民自動的傾向於　種政體，例如很注重他的家庭道德和社會重要性，努力於建立種種情形，使每一家庭都知道這種重要性，新的西班牙將重視平民的利益和促進財產的平均分配，葡萄牙現在迅速的趨向於成爲所謂財富分配平均的國家，西班牙也將向這方向前進，西班牙必定繼續實行工資制度，並且巳接受家庭工資制度的原則，工資不大的事業也將設法改善，尤其是關於任用女工之家庭工業和服裝事業，西班牙現在巳有規定家庭工業的最低工資額，同時也改善了工作的情形，汽車駕駛員的工資已經增加了百分之五十，公共衛生事業也在迅速的進展中，西班牙各省都有肺病療養院，足以容納全國的肺病患者，此外更有兒童醫院的設立，以促進見童的健康。</p>
<p>新的西班牙在生長中？</p>
<h3>小評　日本密使赴歐</h3>
<p>倫敦十一日電傳新聞紀事報訊，『日本密使三人，業已赴歐，其任務爲轉達日方對於本月杪在柏林召集會議之意見。』這裏所指的『柏林會議』，是　意日三個侵略國家共商如何在東西兩半球作進一步發展的會議。從慕尼黑會議到加泰隆那陷落，歐洲局勢已有更新的變動，法西斯侵略者今後怎樣增進相互間的聯絡？怎樣在統一的戰略下實行殖民地之再分割？以至怎樣改三國反共協走爲三國軍事同盟？都將是這個會議的重要議題。</p>
<p>為×，××妥協的外交政策，不僅巳經犧了性阿比西尼亞，奧大利，捷克，不僅正在犧牲西班牙，和歐洲若干中間國家，而且還將召致法西斯侵略者直接向英法等國要求殖民地的冒險行動。德意侵略者固然正在企圖用這次柏林會議來達到覇制歐洲的地位，日本更在陰謀加緊與德意侵略者的勾結？安全實行其『日滿支集圑』和『東亞新秩序』。德國的三B政策正在舊事重提，着着推進，意國稱覇地中海與菲洲的計割，亦已開始最緊張的行動？而日本侵略者則更以　局嚴重而展開了强佔海南島的軍事步驟！</p>
<p>兩條陣綫戰爭的形勢愈加明顯了，凡是不願做法西斯侵略者的奴隸的，凡是愛護和平愛護目由止義的，都應該趕快站到和平陣綫上來，趕快用實力打破國際××匪×的會議及其計劃！</p>
<h3>日×攻海南島</h3>
<p>日×進攻海南島的嚴重的意義，特別是日×開始直接軍事行動以戚脅遠東×××國的嚴重的意義，本報昨日社評巳詳爲指出。現據各方來電，得悉法，英，美各國當局，巳經嚴予注視，正在討論採取明確行動，以謀對付，事勢如何發展，雖尙未可逆料，但下列各點，應爲我們所注意：</p>
<p>第一，日×進攻海南島，其主要企圖有兩點：對內是配台僞滿邊境的對蘇聯挑　事件，造成嚴重事態，以謀制止前方日軍的叛亂和後方各界的反戰，以便利議會通過下年度七十三萬萬日元的龐大軍費預算；對外是配合德意侵略者在歐洲的冒險，展開排斥遠東範圍內列强勢力的前哨戰</p>
<p>第二，日×進攻海南島的行動，由于本身實力的不足，巳經潛伏必然失敗的因素，因此這種行動，不僅不能妄謂×軍聲勢依然浩大，相反的暴露出×軍××××投機冒險。日本這種行動是可以抵抗可以制止的。</p>
<p>第三，日×進攻海南島的行動，對於我國抗戰前途所能發生的重要影響，是擴大戰場，是分散×軍力量，是增加我方的外援與×方的外來壓力，我們西南抗戰形勢不僅不會惡化，而且更將順利發展。</p>
<p>第四，我們應該根據上列這些特點，不放鬆每一個增加×人困難和發展我軍勝利的機會。我們輿論界應該一面向國人說明這些特點。打破×人漢奸親日份子失敗主義者的和平投降主張，一面喚起和平民主各國，注意日×進攻海南島對於英美法荷各隊達東利益的嚴重威脅，迅速聯台切實推準援華制日步驟，粉碎任何國際會議調解『中日衝突』的荒謬主張。這是一，其次，我們在軍事上應該採取緊急步驟，一面大規模以軍火糧秣等接濟島上英勇抗戰的軍隊游擊隊，以便持久的牽制大量×軍於海南一隅；一面加緊粵省我軍的反攻行動，特別是打破粵漢路及西江方面的攻驕。這是二。</p>

<h3>業餘聯誼社提倡　年關節約獻金運動　除浪費惡習獻金救國　獻金交本報匯寄政府</h3>
<p>『業餘聯誼社』是港島的厲行節約的團體之一，它是在聯誼的意義下，鼓吹港中人士的合理生活。以集體的正常娛樂，來掃淸荒淫的享受，它也熱情于抗戰工作，鼓勵各種献金運動。農歷的年關快來了，港島的人們也許在準備快樂了吧？然而，快樂是有條件的呀！『業餘聯誼社』又繼續『一元運動』和『義賣』的精神。提議一個『年節軟金運動』。茲探錄他們關于這運動的提議於下：</p>
<p>『農歷的新年到了，照例同胞們是快樂的慶祝吧—但……我們現在是正在拚命和×人搏鬥。這時，决不是個人尋歡求樂的時候……</p>
<p>『我們抱着必勝的信念，我們是欣喜着我們的國家，在抗戰中踏上了自力更生的路，向前邁進。我們要祝賀我們中國的前途，所以大聲疾呼！二十八年的農歷新年，我們應當把以前用在酒席，打牌，送禮，放爆竹，拜菩薩的錢，統統献給政府，買飛機，槍炮，炸彈來打×人。這才是有意義的舉動。也是輕而易舉的事。現在我們名之謂「年節獻金』……</p>
<p>『現在我們已和香港的『申報館』，『大公報』接洽，代收這筆献金。積有成數，就匯給政府。希望每個人把節省下來的錢，都送到上面說的兩家報館裏去！……</p>
<p>他們這種熱情救國的舉動，一定得到僑胞們的熱烈的同情。同胞們！讓我們熱烈的拿出錢來，嚮應這一運動吧</p>

<h3>時代劇團的進展</h3>
<p>— 俊</p>
<p>組織·藝術·精神都有進步</p>
<p>闊別了幾個月的「時代劇團」、，昨天起又　重在普慶戲院舉行第七次擴大公演了。我參觀這次公演，好像遇了知己故人，精神感到無限的溫馨。過的去「時代劇團」，我雖不甚熟悉，但我親眼看見她成長；這一朶「時代之花」，她是一顆怎麽的種子，怎樣萌了芽，怎樣開花，我都看見，甚而我更致了懇切的願望，希望她能結成美麗的果子。這次是「時代劇團』的第七次公演，除了第六次在澳門公演外，過去五次，我都參觀過，每一次一每次的進步，這部首次在香港上演的「原野」，尤其可以看到「時代」的新生底前途的光明。</p>
<p>要詳晰的知道一點關於「時代劇圑」的消息，在上演「原野」的夜間，跑到普慶戲院的後台探訪李晨風。那時，正在開演着第一幕，在後台，除了前台傳來念台詞的聲音外，在後台工作的人，都是「銜枚疾走」。不響一聲。我見到李晨風君，他穿了梅紗衣服，耳朶還戴了一個耳環，老鄕得幾乎不認識他；原來他正飾演「原野」中的焦大星一角。恐怕影嚮前台，我和他只作耳語，他也僅能約略的把時代的將來計劃吿訴我。他說：</p>
<p>「過去時代的奮鬥，許多愛好戴劇藝術的朋友都會知道，因爲職業劇圑在香港簡直是冒險的嘗　。過去幾次我們在中央定期性的開演，每次都要虧折，應付這些打擊是最困難的事，許多圑員吃盡苦頭，唯一的安慰是社會人士給我們的好評和勛勉之詞，使我們雄心振奮，雖然是凭地艱難困苦，却絕對不敢恢心。這次時代的新生，可說是巳到達了第二個階段，離開我們的目的愈近。</p>
<p>「時代劇團這次公演在組織上已擴大了許多，有許多新的團員加入，這些新團員大都是在內地很有名色的，戰後由內地來到香港；還有三位是戲劇硏究學院的同學，對於戲劇藝術很有修養。所以目前時代劇團團員的陣容，比較從前已堅强許。。吳楚帆先生的客串，我們也很感謝。有一點値得特別注意的，就是歐陽予倩先生費了幾個月光陰，指導我們排演「新官上任」等劇，藝術上有了很大的增益。</p>
<p>「今後時代的計制，有點和以前不同的地方，公演方面，我們决定在港澳兩地作經常的開演，打算每個月有六七大的演期，在香港演二天，在九龍演二大，從前每次公演只演一場，而且時間是在上午，對於一般觀衆未盡適台，現在是改爲日夜場開演，任誰都有參觀的機會；不過，在壯年尾歲首的時候，找一處公演的地方，並不是容易的事，所以我們預定的計劃能吾如願，尙未可必，但我們還願達望能够達到目的。在澳門開演已不成問題，最因難還是在香港找一間適當的戲院。</p>
<p>「至於劇本的選據，也是最重要的問題，除了一些需要特別裝置和角色太多，我們的力量不能做到的劇本外，我們打算多演兩類劇本：一類是對中國抗戰有裨益的；一類是比較接近我們的日常生活的。同時幷注意排演未曾在香港演過的新劇。今次我們公演的「原野」，在香港是第一次，其餘「日出」和「新官上任」，以粵語上演的也算是創見，練習的時間太短，或許有未盡如意之處，同人等决自勉勵，更加努力，爲話劇的發展在香港建立穩固的基礎」。</p>
<p>談到這里，正是「焦大星」登塲的時候，李晨風不能再談了，他約我改日到劇團　談，匆匆登台去了。訪問完畢，我也入座參觀這部「原野」。</p>
<p>曹禺的「原野」，精警不亞於「雷雨」和「日出」，故事的重心雖側重於「仇虎」報仇的事，但對幾個不同的人性的描寫，也相當有力，主要的部份在第三幕，而演出　好也是第三幕。</p>
<p>舊圑員如盧敦，區愛，李晨風，吳四都有進步　尤其是李晨風和盧敦，可說巳得到圓滿的成功了。李月靑所飾的「焦大媽」，演技和合詞都很純熟，淸爽可喜。全劇的髙潮在於仇虎髙喊着：「黑暗的世界啊—我們簡直在地獄中！」這是最精警的一句話。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>兒童玩具的市道</h3>
<p>— 雋人</p>
<p>國產玩具抬頭</p>
<p>記得孩子的時候，每逢了到農曆新年，便欣喜鼓舞着，有好的吃，有封包瞣，尤其餘事，而最感到快活的，是色爸和戚朋所貽贈的玩具，未到新年，在歲闌的當兒，早就看着街頭巷尾的年脊攤子發獃，那里滿陳玩具，紅紅綠綠，光怪陸離，鳴吹叫跳，無奇不有，你想，這對於兒童是多麼誘惑而具有吸引力啊—，畢竟做父母的看透了孩子們這種心理，到這時也不得不大破堅　，選購一些，以博孩子們的歡心。</p>
<p>這些兒童玩具，看來似乎不很値得介意，許多人的見解，以爲玩具旣不是認眞值錢的東西、殊不關重要　實我們如果認眞檢討一下，却是一件最重要不過的事，因爲玩具對於兒童敎育，有絕大的影響，有良好的玩具，也就等於得到良好的兒童敎育。所以在外國對於兒童玩具都有專家硏究，用很大的力量加以改進；回顧我國人士，對此恰巧相反。他們大都是忽略了玩具與敎育的關係，而且以爲玩具不過小物，人人購買所需的也不過是少少的金錢而已；却不曉得積小數成大數，我國每年消耗在玩具的金錢，爲數殊足驚人；可知道玩具雖是微物，却是直接關係於國計民生的。</p>
<p>因爲中國人對玩具的不注重，心地窄狹的日本人，也就覬覦到這條路來了：他們把小巧的事物，製成玩具，大量的向中國推銷，結果，這小小的玩具，便就成爲他們大宗的輸出品之一了。不但中國如此，就是在世界各國的市場中，也就充滿了×貨的玩具。往昔，我們在歲尾年首所見到市而售賣的洋鐵皮寡璐路的日本玩具，關目皆是，甚至深人到農村僻壤，差不多整個中國都遍佈了這些東洋玩具，單就一個新年。在孩子手里消耗的一些玩具，已就換了不少中國人以血汗博來的載金了，想到這點，眞使人不寒而慄了。</p>
<p>一個新年一個新年的過去，同時也一筆一筆的資金流出國外。後來一半是爲了國人有點覺悟，一×××××××××××，對於玩具的製造，也逐漸注意起來了。國產玩具，近年來確有了很大的進步，直到目前，雖然不能完全挽囘這筆漏巵，但也有很大的裨益。</p>
<p>不過我國因爲工業不發達，所以製造玩具仍多爲手工藝出品，木製的如刀劍槍戟，用銀漆塗了，再用紅布裝飾一下，這是最普通的玩具，所以直到現在，人人尙有以××××××的心理存在，大槪是因爲這種玩具的影嚮。還有一種用楊梅木雕成的人物，如樵夫，漁翁，織女等，工作很精細，雕刻美麗，不獨可以作爲玩具，實在可以稱得上藝術作品；外國人對於這種木刻人物很喜歡，購買的不少。這次金門萬國博覽會，木刻人物運往展覽的達數百種。雕刻這種人物的能手以福州人爲多，可惜其間有許多製出種種惡劣的事物如賭博吸煙等，對於國際視聽，不無影響。紙製的玩具也多，主要的有風車，面具，紙鼠，紙蛇等；泥製的除泥人外，有鳥類，果木，玲瓏司喜，但果柄鷄脚用鐵絲製成，不便兒童玩弄；陶製磁製的工作很精巧，可惜容易破碎，因此銷路不廣；火漆製的各種動物，可以浮水，但現在也很少見了。這都是過去的中國固有玩具，目前流行着的很少，有之，只是一些木器，竹器等，如竹製機關槍，木製鵝鴨，都是碩果備存了。</p>
<p>璐路與玩具，起初沒有一些不是×貨，到上年前中國才設廠自製，成績不惡，大洋囡囡的造工，且遠勝×貨，可惜出品太少，印鐵玩具，起初也是完全×貨，目前國產的印鐵玩具相當發達，而且一切人物都以中國人爲模型，所以很受歡迎，替代了若干×貨，有一種新與的玩具，就是小型的錫製軍隊，製法是用模型鑄印的，各種士兵，各種姿態的都有，炮兵，大刀隊，坦克車，無不俱全，一組是中國軍，一組是××軍，排起來便是對壘作戰的樣子。因爲目前正在抗戰時期，這算是最應時的玩具，銷路很好，海外華僑定購的尤多，所以由香港運到外埠的，一個月平均有幾萬元，你想，數目是多麽驚人啊！香港製造這些玩具的有幾家，都能獲利；但可惜其中有一部份模型是購自國外的，所以軍隊的服飾不大類似中國兵，這二點非改善不可。</p>
<p>我曾把今年玩具的市道向一個販賣玩具的叩詢過，據他說：今年因爲美國影片「雪姑七友傳」轟動一時的原故，所以片中的八個主角，都被製成玩具。商人是素來善用機會的，所以除製了膠質，路路等的人物外，更把這些人物作爲商標圖案，如香粉，手帕，領帶，被單，賀年片，紙烟等到有同時這種玩具也就大行其道了。雪姑和七友都是活潑可愛，一如在電影中，很得兒童們的歡心。今年玩具市道特別好大槪是因爲香港人口增加的緣故，不過有一個現象是很樂觀的，就是×貨的玩具，巳比往昔減少多了。在新年，每個孩子手中拿了玩具，固是快樂不過的，如果能够因爲這件玩具而添厚了國家的資源，發展了國家的工業，相信他們將更快活了。</p>

<h3>銀色的陰謀</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>日本法西斯侵略中國，除了軍事的政洽的經濟的侵略以外，還不惜消耗鉅額經費，實行文化侵略，而對於電影戲劇界的陰謀，則從不久以前上海光明公司的「茶花女」渡日事件發生之後，才引起雷影戲劇界的注意。而日本法西斯及其在華代理人對於電影戲劇方面的陰謀亦就不斷地被揭發出來。</p>
<p>單就電影方面而言，當此抗戰由第一階段轉向第二階段，日本侵略者急謀維持與强化佔領地區統洽權之際，其陰謀毒計便更表現得熱閙緊張。他們對於電影陰謀的目的與內容是利用電影作品，一面以色情痲痺我淪陷區人民的民族自尊心自信心，以鬼怪引導我淪陷區人民的抗×復仇情緒到失敗主義宿命主義的沉淪之途，一面宣傳虛僞惡毒的懷柔政策，使淪陷區人民不僅甘心屈膝於日×統治之下，甚且便利×僞統治者壓榨其血汗，以爲繼續進侵，達到征服中國獨覇遠果之資。</p>
<p>依據這種陰謀，日本法西斯决定了電影的大陸政策，這種政策的具體方針與辦法，固然絕對秘密，但據已經暴露的一部份計劃，則可分爲兩點，第一是實行銀幕上的中日文化「提　」，由日本軍部御用的文化部們支配日軍佔領地區的電影事業，帮助日本軍隊政治部實行征服的工作；第二是利用及製造以色情神怪與粉飾太平的中國電影作品，運到日本及其殖民地去，以達到宣揚「皇軍」成績及掩飾其在華暴行。（上述兩點根擴日本特務機關宣傳部去年六月十日在北平長安街召開的「日本大陸政策及其動向座談會』的結論，僞臨時政府敎育部文化局長文訪蘇「中日親善先從電影說起」的結論，和日本國際映書新聞社長市出彩的主張，均見日本『國際映書新聞』一二一六號，日本映盡大陸發展號）文化漢奸張連生，（東和影片公司）主張「日本電影在華活動，千萬不能在影片上加上日本或者滿洲的名義，最好完全以中國電影的姿態出現，表面上和日本滿洲毫無關係，並且使它成爲看上去完全是中國人的事業。』他又主張『無論如何要以變愛爲中心，而且這種繼愛必須相當沛膩的東西。無論演技，或是演員，必定要有相當的戲劇味，並且要很下流的演出才行』，這種主張自然立　爲。　關所採納。</p>
<p>銀色進攻的陰　就這樣展開了，實行這種陰謀的婁囉們，便在國內國外以至那些接近祖國的特殊的都市上活躍起來。據二月七日本港報載，本港南洋及美洲，間有若十投機電影商人，以維持營業爲藉口，以四千元左右爲代價，運片到華北去放映。這當然只是銀色陰籮活動擴大的一個例子而巳。其他未經揭露及未能公開的事實，還不知有多多少少！我們在這裏僅敢爲關係當局電影商人，以及影劇　業員諸君吿者：第一，日本法西斯對我實行文化侵略，甚至單以銀色的侵略而言，也都有相當廣大與完密的計劃，也都不惜消耗相當鉅額的金錢，單看美聯社二月七日東京電，說日本官方公佈不久將派娛樂船赴粵、船上載有無線電機一百五十架，留聲機六百具，華語宣傳片一萬二千張，棋鞠一萬八千具，日本電影片無數，卽可見其一斑。我們抗戰所持以爭取最後勝利者卽在全國生動力量的集中領導，我們雖然不怕日本任何懷柔宣傳陰謀，但觀於×方如此活躍與我方動員工作的不够，是卽應有所警覺的。最髙領袖巳經確定第二期抗戰政治重於軍事宣傳重於組織的原則，我們卽應在這原則下面，加緊實行文化部門尤其是最與羣衆接近的電影戲劇界的總動員，一面掃蕩×奸的烟幕與陰謀，一面增進集中領導全國生動力量的力量。其次，廣泛深入地展開電影戲劇的除舊佈新運動，一面肅淸電影獻劇的腐惡成份，一面健全前進成份推進落伍成份建立鞏固的抗日統一戰綫，使全國電影戲劇都爲中國抗戰與世界反法西斯侵略而服務。此外，自上海失陷以後，中國電影事業者受了重大打擊，廣州失陷以後，華南電影業者又失去了石歧江門台山等處的市塲，因此少數盲目及不肖份子實行投機，甘爲×奸利用，我們對此亦應妥籌辦法，制止一切危險的傾向，打出一條正大的道路，我們相信敏感的電影業者，决無自甘墮落爲×奸利用的，這里有賴於影劇從業員，文化工作者與與論界的密切合作者，自亦甚大，願各勉旃！</p>

<h3>暴目，抬頭，開步走！　時代劇團的過去與將來</h3>
<p>— 秋羅</p>
<p>「時代劇團」以靑年的勇進的姿態，出現在話劇底理論和實踐都異常貧弱的香港。「時代」沒有錢，沒有後台老板，祗憑着團員與圑昌間的一把嘴，一幅能吃苦的身手與精神，在半年的苦鬥之聞，居然在香港打開一個話劇的新局面。中國旅行劇團之來，誠然給香港話劇以新的刺激，但種花者還是「時代」，「時代」也開出了好果。現在環在香港的話劇團體，有二三十個單位，正在擴大起來，發揚開去。</p>
<p>「時代劇團」也就是初期的中華藝協會戲劇組和華南戲劇研究社的後身，人數相同，祗是換湯不換藥。年前「華南」曾假座高陞戲院開演『蘆溝橋』『雷雨』等劇，雖然生意上是失敗了，但話劇能得到商人的重視，也就在那一個時候開始。在華南的戲劇運動史上，他們與觀衆是不會陌生的。</p>
<p>接着，華南戲劇研究社曾打算到南洋羣島去，企圖在能過得日子的環境下，替國家盡一點宣傳的責任。『華南』派出了導演李芝淸跟商人接洽，不幸失敗了。失敗的原因，十九是商人認爲話劇會虧本，寧可把幹話劇的資本，改來拍電影。盧敦君曾對記者說過，意思大的是這樣的：話劇是不會失敗的，也不應失敗的，祗是話劇沒有一定的生意，根本和電影不同。比如一部電影在南洋，安南·暹羅三屬可以買四千元，而話劇却沒有這樣固定的價格，所以保守慣的商人，就不把話劇和電影響樣看待，而話劇的出路。便在商人的密底算盤的主觀錯誤的估計下，把完整的藝術品，忘記得一乾二凈了。我同意盧敦君的卓見，要是話劇能逐漸抓住觀衆，那末，生意一好，謀利的商人便可無條件來斟酌了。</p>
<p>『華南』的南游失敗，跟着便拍了一部電影，仍以華南的團員做骨幹，那一部片子是『世代寃仇』，由李芝淸導演，片子拍完了之後，『華南』也同時完了。</p>
<p>一個時期，大家都沉着等候機會。不久。『時代劇團』便開始組織，開始成立了。『時代』先在中央戲院上演。先後演出『前夜』『古城的怒吼』『夜光杯』『油漆未乾』時間由每天上午九時至一時。生意和演出，都着着向上急進，商人把話劇的生意，開會討論。這顯然比前一年進步得多多了。</p>
<p>時代的演出，引起無數話劇團體的不斷組織。不斷出現。而國內的話劇風氣也激急地向島上吹來，『中旅』是最顯著的。『中旅』在太平普慶兩戲院運續上演許多名劇，更給商人以更新的認識。同時，時代劇團在友軍的影響之下，最近更取得夜間的上演權。</p>
<p>他們的第一期工作——定期性公演，直至第五次結束的當兒，恰巧名劇家歐陽予倩先生南來，允爲該團導演，經過這儸劃時期之後，推進杳港話劇運動就益形積極了。</p>
<p>自去年十二月起，他們就在歐陽予倩先生指導之下，忙於排戲，第六次的公演是在澳鬥，現在，又自本月十日起，一連四天在九龍普慶戲院上演，作爲第二期第七次大公演，演出的劇目是全國第一流劇作家曹禺先生的著名三部曲——『原對』，『日出』，『雷雨』，和名劇作家陳白塵先生近作的國防諷刺喜劇『新官上任』。這些劇本都是傑出的作品，配合他們練熟的技巧，又有歐陽先生的領導，成功是可以預期的、</p>
<p>現在生意和演出，都頗樂觀。本來幹話劇的不必斤斤於生意問題。但戲院老板認爲非有生意，斷不予以上演橡。這是鐵一般的事實，我們幹話劇應該針對這個環境，先把本來的演出，做到成功之路，以引起廣大觀衆的擁護，有了廣大觀衆的擁護，商　沒有不樂予合作。商人的心目中，除了錢之外，還有什麽呢？所以我們不唱高調，却要認淸正確的路線，拚命苦幹，時代劇團是一定爲它的前途的。</p>
<p>所以我認爲一時代劇圑」旣然經過艱苦的鬥爭，艱苦的經營，今後更該貫澈初志，尋求出路。至於時代的人物，也有很好的訓練，祇要幹下去，幹下去，沒有不竟全功的。最後一句：希望于「時代」的，是不驕不傲，沉着勇進，認淸抗戰藝術的使命，向光明的大道，舉目，抬頭開步走。</p>
<h3>特別推薦　新官上任　時代今晚演出</h3>
<p>『新官上任』是名劇作家陳白塵先生近作的四幕國防譏諷喜劇，描寫淪陷區內無恥漢奸爭權奪利的醜態，陪烘出×人對我無辜民衆殘酷的壓迫，內容有骨有肉，深刻諧趣。月前同時給時代劇團和中華藝術劇圑所注意，而且又同時在戲劇大家歐陽予倩先生導演下開始精心排演了。上月中，曾分別在港澳兩地演出，成績各有優勝，這，我們在本刊第七期巳經有一篇文章介紹過了。現在，「時代」在第七次擴大公演中，特別定于今（星期日）晚隆重献演，在這里，以粵語演出，算是首次紀錄：以歐陽先生的導演手法，和他們精練的藝術，是値得我們特別推的薦。請諸君記住：今晚八時正，在九龍普慶戲院。</p>

<h3>時代的課題</h3>
<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>在國內的戲劇工作者勇敢地集體地參加戰鬥，配合軍事動員而鼓舞民衆戰鬥意志，加强兵士政治敎育的時候，孤島上的戲劇工作者覺得有點徨徬了。一方面，在安全的後方的後方，圑結沒有內地的鞏固，工作沒有內地的緊張，觀衆對象不同，環境條件不同，因之統一陣線始終沒有建立：話劇工作者到那裏去呢？</p>
<p>主要地，話劇是以一種娛樂的方式出現，而這種娛樂還沒有得到文化水準低落的民衆之普遍的擁護，另一方面因為他的革命性與技術的不成熟，還不能取得『髙等華人』的了解與鑒賞，他停留在前進的智識份子中間，是較爲有力的自我敎育的工具，是對靑年說敎，勸服的一種藝術的工其，或者只成爲逢場『助與』的粗陋的節目，或是與流行的粵劇與影片之極端的反動（Reactfon=反應）而已。我們，話劇工作者們，能以這爲滿足嗎？</p>
<p>不，决不，在神聖的抗戰還沒有開始，救亡還動飽受戲劇奠定了基礎。卽是說，他們以躍進的舞台技巧（如舞台艷），和成熟的表演藝術（集合多數受過訓練的演員和明星），爭取了落後的市民羣，使他們引起了正義感和愛國心；在抗戰開始後，商人的服務運動的努力，就大部分是這種藝術傳染的結果。同時，使專門劇團成爲可能，建立了劇運的正規新軍，使電影藝術也有了時代覺醒，不得不追着舞台劇的內容和形象化的方式而跨進了一大步。現在，倫爲游擊區的孤島的上海，依然有許多戲劇工作者，艱苦地技術地工作着，使戲劇理論的建立和進步的劇本之供給沒有中斷。</p>
<p>教們至少應該這樣做。</p>
<p>不，我們不能止於這樣做。香港下是上海，一九三九年在鬬爭中的中華民挨更不同七七以後被侮辱，被損害的人羣。抗戰的火花，照耀到了全世界，愛國的巨濤，激蕩了無一個階層，每一個堆域，每一個男女的心，大衆要求血肉的，理實的，戰關的，史詩的戲劇，比什麼都迫切。可是失敗的是我們，我們在工作的情緒上，遠落後於羣衆的熱望；在內容和形式下，都不能比其他舊產的超髙進步而適應時代指提的需要。在這時，比起以前的上海，我們要更進步，更活躍地繼續並擴展我們的民族解放運動的鏡子與發動機的戲劇革新運動；要把他的不只職業外，通俗化，爭取市民，還要把他當成切實的服務抗戰的工具，特別爲傷兵，難民，一切受難的同胞一切的力量，爲建立自由幸福新中國的而奮斗！</p>
<p>把專門劇團的建設和服務的工作團體合而爲一用職業的努力，謀更多人的福利，使新與戲劇在商品外創造價値，服務民族解放；這是時代的頭一個課題。</p>
<p>不斷地硏究，不斷地實踐，經過地具有政治醒覺性，使藝術的成就，不游離于行進中的社會和生長中的民族之外；這是時代的第二個課題。</p>
<p>做成舊劇與低級麻醉的電影的反對派用現實的律動，打破漢奸性的麻醉，給電影從業員和現象以强烈的刺激，從而使電影也不爲時所代捨棄，使話劇成為電影演員的研究所與現象的洗禮的圣堂：這是時代的等三個課題。</p>
<p>建立機械化的戲劇游擊隊，做內地戲劇單位的連絡者，與組織者，爲更前進的話劇制造觀衆，這是時代的第四個課題。</p>
<p>通過世界共同的情感，用現實的形象，引道世界和平愛好者的人類，認識和平前哨的中國的戰　，由於人類良心的共鳴，而起來撲滅毀滅文化的強盜！這是時代的課題之五。</p>
<p>和建國的工作配合，創造配得起偉大的中華民族的藝術，爲新生的一代預備良好的精神食糧；這是時代最後的一個（但不是最不用輕重的一個）課題。</p>

<h3>消滅我蠶絲業之陰謀</h3>
<p>— 吳馬</p>
<p>後者是將値得（請注意値得二字）移動的東西、儘量地儘速地向後方如雲、桂、四川等省搬運、以備與政府合作來開發西南的蠶絲業、同時將蠶室等等、實行焚燬、俾免被日人利用、因爲在政府方面、巳是幾經聲明、對于民間的資本和技術、都是非常需要、而且這個時機、也正是全國民衆共盡匹夫之責的時候、各種的生產企業理應跟隨政府西移、除掉直接幹着游擊隊工作的人以及間接的搗亂日人統制的事業以外、原沒有理由可以居住在淪陷區域、現在、又適逢着淪陷區域的不許荀延殘喘、那末除掉向游擊隊勢力區域移動之外、毫無疑義的是只有加入後方的蠶絲生產陣營、好在以江浙蠶種業者過去的經驗、無論是經營方面、或是技術方面、足够到一個絲蠶業荒蕪的區域中去做拓荒工作、伺况還有政府輔助呢、</p>
<p>（我覺得有些規模較大的種場、其力量足够兩條路綫同時並進、）</p>
<p>總之、使能堅决地採用此兩條路綫、以作目下日人壓迫勢力下的緊急對策的話、則失之東隅、尙能收之桑楡、如果喪心病狂、俯首貼耳地甘願在日人「合作」之名下爲經濟的奴才、蹈無錫等絲廠業的覆轍、則不特蠶種場經營者個人聲敗名裂、成爲蠶絲業界之敗類、亦且係中華民之族罪人、爲功爲罪、俱在此一轉瞬間。在還個日人正向戰區蠶種制造廠開始進攻、而蠶種廠本身還沒有背叛中國甘願爲日人之附庸的當兒、敬以所知、披諸報端、藉以揭發日人對戰區蠶種業之陰謀、並促蠶種業界之急速而深切的覺悟、</p>

<h3>南華南三戰而後破九龍　獲銀牌準決賽權　馮景祥大好頭顱兩次建功</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）經巳兩次算賬、仍未分髙下之南華南對九龍會那幕特別銀牌複賽、在昨天、兩軍舉行第三次爭奪戰于掃桿埔場、引動球迷數千、到塲一看究竟、</p>
<p>此役乃兩隊之生死關頭、如若失敗、便壽終正寢、因而咸下必勝决心、欲得準决賽權、　？經過七十分鐘的劇爭、南華卒不負衆望，以二比一淘汰九龍、顧戰時情形、你來我往、富有精彩、誠是一幕不可多得的佳作、</p>
<p>南華演出、士氣極盛、尤以馮景祥、張榮才、梁榮照數員最出色、</p>
<p>羅斗文亦恢復常態、兩球之得、他均與有功勢、李恩樑初臨大戰、表演不壞、的是可造之材、望南華足球部委員、對此—加意提拔、敢斷將來必成大器、</p>
<p>南華致勝原因、全在前衞綫支持得力、進退有據、首尾相應、尤以榮照最英勇、前綫能得允份的活動、固由於前綫諸子俱有良好演出、然其得前衛掩護推進之力尤大、惟劉慶才的動作似嫌遲綏、還黏他在遲緩中能够鎭靜從事</p>
<p>九龍之敗、的是技不如人、加以各員對於此戰太重視、太與奮、圖勝又太心急、故各員演出、反常操諸過當、每見其前線五人、難造成不少機會、復能衝刺、祗是心急則亂、聯絡不週、每衝進南華腹地時、必失諸最後一着</p>
<p>前衛綫三人、至多　作、卑利士更爲老成練達、內衞線一人亦算稱職、門將勁利、似太過認眞、一見南華前鋒來攻、便愁失守、致有幾次離鬥衝出、反自增加危險成份</p>
<p>比賽詳情、記在後面、戰時兩陣排成如下、</p>
<p>（南華南）</p>
<p>張榮才</p>
<p>李天生　麥紹漢</p>
<p>李國威　梁榮照　劉慶才</p>
<p>羅斗文　李恩良　馮景祥　黎兆榮　鄧廣森</p>
<p>（九龍會）</p>
<p>刻利</p>
<p>鳥烈芝　衣化</p>
<p>力士</p>
<p>尼　卑利　麥士</p>
<p>波廖亞臣　路維地　士申都氏　維佐芝　路小諾士</p>
<p>號笛一響、戰神駕臨、一般迷民、都屛息靜氣地注視着那戰幕揭開、</p>
<p>景祥一馬當先、逢山開路、半途遇芯卑利士、戰了一個囘合、景祥被迫、引軍而退、</p>
<p>廖亞臣邊陲造反、勢頭頗兇、紹漢守土有責、知來者不善、飛馬殺　、敵將急竄、</p>
<p>那邊廂、諾士輕騎偷襲、立心不軌、旣近底綫、把球兒切中、申都氏以爲有機可乘、拚命衝上、可是方到城下、南華守將早把「阿斗」奪去了、</p>
<p>此時、九龍三前衞方掩護前綫出擊、內防　虛、抑亦料不到南華反攻如此神速、正待回帥、已被景祥越過馬頭、張眼一望、前途似錦、乃把球兒一　、斗文接着、再進一、瞬已深入要地、提　切中、　到好處、量祥固氣　枝、策馬接應、遇此良緣、　有　過之理、俟球兒下隊、　卽著呢角一捕、幼利的開關政策、至此逼得開放、雖仍欲挽，已爲時英及、圑產球迷、喜得手舞足踏、共慶南華初開勝利之鬥、</p>
<p>南華勝後、士氣益盛、前綫五虎、演出如龍爭珠、如獅滾球、的是大觀、九龍守將、被困一隅、危城欲墜、還虧他們死力抵禦、得以不致冉失、然在此種情形下、顯見南華得勢、一般迷民、此時都已斷定結果勝利必屬南華的、</p>
<p>九龍經幾許掙扎、始突圍而出、卑利士中軍策應、申都士、佐芝、維地三路來犯、榮照出迎、威風八八面，已而卑利士在南華要塞外開來自由球、天生一頂、力保京畿、</p>
<p>亡　、南華前頭部隊、又乘機推進、鳥烈之見大軍殺到、手忙脚亂、自嘆千不該萬不該、以手觸着球兒、裁判員覩狀、絕不徇情、執法如山、判罰十二碼球、國產球迷至此樂極忘形、都以爲南華找着多勝一球的機會了、怎曉景祥踢來力道不足、劾利又機警、看出景祥向右方射去、立卽跟着球兒的來勢一撲、果然得心應手、擺脫一場災厄、四座中陡起一陣嘆惜聲和拍掌聲、</p>
<p>九龍脫險　、三軍振奮、尋瑕抵隙、大舉反攻、俄而廖亞臣左路抄擊、施放冷箭、幸榮才早有防備、未迪所算、然此時九龍攻勢方盛、眨眼間、又迫得角球、遂見南華門前人馬雜沓、鳥烈芝頓兵後方、亦引師而前、遙放一彈、急若流星、榮才眼明手快、抱個滿懷、</p>
<p>景祥領軍進攻、形勢很好、祇是幾次扣關、都未命中、有頃、兆榮問津、發射入網、無如他先行越位、判作不算、敎國產球迷空歡喜</p>
<p>戰事至此漸趨劇烈、恍如肉搏、一般迷民有得神飄魄蕩、而雙方前鋒亦先後找得攻門機會、但都給守門的救去、上半時旋卽完了、</p>
<p>休息片刻、再動干戈、九龍各將志在收復失地、　勇異常、說時遲、那時快、申都士與佐芝、已兵臨城下、南華守將力戰、局面立轉安定、</p>
<p>兆榮得球、向左一送、斗文接着即進、單刀赴會、劾利覩此情景、大彈琵琶、急離門出截、亦被斗文賺過、至此、劾利巳如待决之囚、怎曉得斗文最後一着、給球兒走出野外、可惜之至，</p>
<p>廣森揭竿而起、引兵深入、望門發彈、雖未中鵠、然其時斗文伏兵左路、伺機而乘、見球掠來、截得切中、景祥在中路接應，乃再施故技、大好頭戲、又建一功、看客歡呼、聲動山谷、而南華勝利之局、更趨穩定了、</p>
<p>九龍各將以一失再失、心裏難過、尤其是前綫三鋒、竭力反攻中、露出强横舉動、</p>
<p>在中塲冉逐之際、突見卑利士送糧前方、申都士跟着　刺、天生獨當一面、原可無虞、豈知他竟大意失足、替申都士造成機會、給他得間竄入、榮才處此絕境、巳無挽救辦法、擺開空門、任申都士一射而入、南華此失、萬分不値、老練如天生、竟然倒棚孩兒、眞意料不到的事、</p>
<p>九龍意外報回一球、像得絕處逢生、一般士氣、極爲暢旺、在他們乃想多獲一球、平反敗局、在南華諸子則欲保持勝利、以竟全功、因而各懷心事、情形極度緊張、</p>
<p>不久、南華三前術、推動進攻、兆榮猛撲而入、劾利被困、衣化力士盡力救駕、經幾許困難、才吿無事、</p>
<p>廖亞臣來犯、紹漢力拒、麥士組路上前助處、遠放一箭、榮才接個正着、</p>
<p>此後兩軍互爲攻守、尙多精彩、惟紀錄均無再增、旣至完場、南華卒以二比一保得勝利、淘汰九龍、奪得準决賽權、（球場太歲）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論女人</h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>兪琰席上腐談卷上有云：「男猶天也，女猶地也，天之雨露，未嘗不沾濡也，而地有肥磽之不同。亦有生物者，亦有不生物者，地若瘦瘠或　鹵，或瓦礫，而責其不生物，是鐫冰而改火，按籃而求朱，徒爾覬望而已，無獲也。」這確可稱得上，一章舊日的女人新論。</p>
<p>恐怕在中國可考的文献上，女人從沒有得着過「人」的地位罷，這裏的以女人比作地，有瘦瘠剛鹵之分，更有能生物，和不生物之別，就是古舊傳統的思想的一個代表觀念。記得東北故鄉，有一句俗諺，「女人是種子，撒在肥地裏就肥，撒在瘦地裏就瘦」，這又是一種宿命的觀點，而將女人比作種仔了，但到底，還不是一個人。</p>
<p>這見解最好的代表，要推我們的孔聖人了，他也是說過「惟女千與小人爲難養」的鄙棄話。因爲女人是最不可靠，難以拘束的壞坯于，所以在古文孝經裏有「閨門之內，具禮義乎」的嚴定禮制的話，甚而到了孟子的時代，他竟以平天下，覇四方，也必須要先覇制住了女人做條件，就如他說：「刑於寡妻，至於兄弟，以御於家邦」，這明明是說「女人是禍水」了，平天下，當然必須先平禍水。</p>
<p>至於女人是否有人的資格，在古代的中國，這個官司頗難打，因爲主控與原吿人，俱都是男人，而女人根本是不許出堂，不許伸辯的被吿，因之偏面的罪讞，也就此地定下了。</p>
<p>所可喜的，時代是女人的聲辯者，到了令日，似乎前古所有的一切罪讞，一律推翻，並且女人也能跟着時代，漸漸的走上一個最新的路，同時就在今日而言，有的女人不止趕上了時代，並且也趕在時代之前，做着男人的先生了。</p>
<p>所可惜的是女人們的事業，似乎總是偏重在另一方面發展，比如在日本的婦女們，她們專以犧牲了身體，作爲報國與發展民族威力的最好方策。就連我們也是用「日本是靠了兵，浪人，娼妓」作爲鄙棄日本的口頭語。</p>
<p>再說我國呢，在前九個月時候，在南洋某處的一個華僑女子，也竟是標出以身許國的誓語，如果有人購萬元公債，即許爲終身伴侶。這事可惜發生在南洋，至今不見有下文。再有呢，在去年九月二十三日的某晚報，曾載有這麼一段新聞：</p>
<p>「日前梧州中西酒樓有中西人士，假座讌會，當酒酣耳熱時，有亞細亞公司某君提議謂各校書有樂於獻吻者，卽由同席諸人競捐，最多者卽與吻，結果于咄嗟之間，計欵盈千，競捐最多者爲西人湯姆氏，以三百四十元與花寄塵潔貞兩校書各接惜吻云。」</p>
<p>從這裏姑不論是否利權外溢，不過以一吻之微換來數百法幣，似乎是一件極够本的事，何况献吻的就是　身的女人，當然爲了有合於「各佔各人崗位努力救國」一條現行原則，有人想，這似乎更是一件最合適不過的一件事。</p>
<p>然而，南洋一華僑女郞的救國徵婿，是不太合理的，至於梧州校書的獻吻，依然是在男人『酒酣耳熱』的時候中提出來的，這樣的救國，當然不是我們所讚成的，因爲新時代的女人，已在今日抗戰中，創造更髙貴，偉大聖潔的路程了。尾崎士郎作林煥平譯</p>
<h3>廢墟與砲煙</h3>
<p>— 尾崎士郎作　林煥平譯</p>
<p>大佐一邊說明着，一邊就以似親切非親切的能度，頻頻對她說話。同行中的某君拿出一根香煙來，要　給她，她做出意外的臉色，拒絕了，再三地給她，她的臉上浮起少女似的嬌羞來了。勉强地投擲給她，點着了火，于是很有味兒的吸起來了。在稍前的廣場上，有一個像是惡黨的形相的苦力，用着沒有切得開的樣子的菜刀，削落着緊黏在生猪皮上的肉。在湖口，聽說山岳畫家吉出博氏已經來了一個禮拜了。由浮田中尉領路，我們攀登石鐘山，不一會兒，巳經滿身汗了。下來時，碇泊地司令部巳凖備好了午飯了。罐頭牛肉和赤眼魚——在我的食桌之前，還擺着冷酒一壺。在這裏，我們會到了乍看頗似豫備將校的吉田氏。和坐在横邊的我們的引率者松岡中尉碰杯交飲着，潮漸地爛醉起來了。午後，我們乘井上大佐所豫備好的舢舨，攀登聳立在湖中的大姑山。如果在這裏還有逃不掉的中國老人家，恐怕可以聽到各種各樣的傳說吧。湖裏恐怕充滿着無底的傳說哩，大姑山寄宿着二千年來的歷史的姿影。聽說連溯江的魚羣，到這大姑山之前，也都成了做過寒暄才通過的習慣。它的由來是無所考査的。但井上大佐也說今天才是第一次登這大姑山。大概除軍隊以外，登道個山的日本人，以你爲第一人吧，」他說。我從靠近大姑山的舢板中，幾次地囘頭望湖口的市街。午後的斜陽明亮地照　着。但這殘骸似的都市，看來似不巳喪失盡了從這無氣味的沉靜中再爬起來的氣力了。在下雨的晚上，從碇泊地司令部的窗子望去，在幽暗的山陰裏靑色的火飄飄地燃亮着，井上大佐這樣說着，臉都陰暗起來了：那不是一個兩個，是五個六個重疊着，從這個山到那個山谷，像迷了途似潔蕩着。最初以爲這不是×人的游擊隊出現了嗎？？于是在夜中命令警備隊出發去看了，但是，却又沒有那樣的形跡，加之，那裏附近又沒有×人的屍骸，這樣看起來，是燐火吧，那也難說哩。</p>
<p>在聽着他談話之中，荒廢了的夜之街市，變成怪幻的形態，浮現到我的腦裏來了。戰爭粉碎了在末梢神經所起的一切奇怪的現象而進展了，在今日隱匿着個人的仇恨的幽靈之出現的間隙，恐怕巳經沒有了吧，我活着再度來訪這個城市的機會，我想恐怕也沒有了。（完）</p>
<p>附記：作者尾崎土郞，爲日本純藝術派名作家，他寫戰爭文學，也是以追求藝術的美爲第一前提，日本軍閥的侵略意德沃羅基，在他的頭腦中，都似乎未能起指導的作用，故其作品，較爲客觀，較合事實。譯者曾譯其「楊子江之秋」，連續發表于去十二月十四，五·六·七四天之申報上，頗得讀者好評。今茲所謂，乃登于新年號之「改造」雜誌上，「廢墟與砲煙」爲總題，內分「在湖口」］「大姑山」，「天空的浪漫主義」，「色彩的變化」四章，本文只爲選譯第一章「在湖口」，蓋其他三章沒有値得翻譯之價値也。文中有三數處，曾被譯者刪削，特及。</p>
<h3>漢奸心理的分析</h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>抗戰爆發後，國人曾給「漢奸」下過一番「心理分析」。據說產生「漢奸」的原因有四：即（一），不深知亡國奴的痛苦，而拜金或失業者：（二）抱抗敵必敗論，而企圖先立僞功者：（三）食過皇祿，因此欲報皇恩者；（因）完全無智識，而拜金或失業者。</p>
<p>上述一·四·兩條產生「漢奸」的原因，我們可以向「拜金而失業者」加以說服的，而到現在，×人的殘暴行爲，也早已證明了亡國奴是萬做不萬得的，英國名記者田伯烈氏H　J　Tlmperley的「外人目覩中之×軍暴行」，這是最好一本「亡國奴痛苦記」的好書。除了這，我們還得加以救濟失業者才行。否則，呌他們餓着肚皮來奉行救國，這樣的「恥食周粟」的『伯夷叔齊』，在「無智識者」中怕是找不出來的，事實上，我們是也斷斷乎不能叫他們去學「伯夷叔齊」的樣。「伯夷叔齊」的故事，是應該以「豐衣足食」的「達官貴人」，去記熟的。</p>
<p>關於一·三·兩條這樣的「漢奸」，是「無可救藥」的，我們就得要加以無情的鞭擊，如果可能的話：食其肉而寢其皮這樣的「處罰」他們，原也不爲過分。</p>
<p>食過皇祿而因此報其皇恩奢，這早巳是不足爲人道者了，這是巳經奴隸成了性，這是一切的的「家狗」的本色，這是「人類」的「頭銜」加諸於他們的恥辱，這樣的「東西」，如果容忍他們在存帝在世界上，實在是遺毒匪淺，不消除之，人類的前途實在是不堪設想了！</p>
<p>然而更爲可毒的，是「看風轉舵」的那些自以爲是「識時務者」的「俊傑」了，一見×人的「三斧頭」的蠻勁，認爲他們是必勝無疑，而自己方面是必敗的了，因此爲欲先立僞功，就美其名曰「我不入地獄誰入地獄」，就赫然去就「委員」或是「市長」之類的「職位」了，當然，也有些「聰明人」是抱着『三不主義」的，看來是旣不欲立「偽功」，而儼然像是一本正經的「救世者」了，不過這種人是更可毒，所謂爲「洞里赤練蛇」者，就是指的這些老謀深算的陰險家，然而這却不在我的話內。</p>
<p>却說看風駛舵的抱「中國必敗論」而先立僞功榮任上海「市長」的傳筱庵，最近却「頗萌悔意」了，原因是「中國最後勝利之期，確巳不還」，因此懊喪萬分，認爲「六個月後，恐不能再在上海立足。「他的這種所謂「頗萌悔意」與其當作他的「梅恨」着，不如說，中國的持久抗戰，只有使種這投機取巧者的消滅，在將來新中國的建成上說來，實在是非常的有益。抗戰實在是太偉大了。給在東江記者們的意見</p>
<h3>我們得忠實的暴露</h3>
<p>— 彭泰</p>
<p>給在東江記者們的意見</p>
<p>一度遭受××洗刦蹂躪的東江，在災淸方面，在目前政府領導方面，在民情方面，……都很直得　道出去，好讓華僑更熱烈的救濟，妤讓遠居外地的同鄕關懷。我們記者責任是多麼的艱重啊？記者們？</p>
<p>工作的表現給了我們專實的証明：東江的記者們的工作還距離了自己的任務還很遠雖然有的很英勇地走上博增，莞邊區，最接近×人的火綫，也有辛苦地踏上最偏僻的地方。可是，不够還是不够，大家得承認吧！</p>
<p>一，只能在綫與點上打圈子：任隨翻開各種報紙來看也可以。都証明記者的足跡還只能好像×人佔領我們的河山一樣，僅僅於城市的內部，河流與馬路的周圍很小的區域，例如×人登陸時的左翼進攻地，阿婆角，稔山，平海，凌坑。白茫花，平山，横運，泰尾……一帶，右翼的霞涌，澳頭，境岡，葵涌……一帶，很痛心的把它遺忘了，不重視了，那裏的材料，斷不會比淡水，比龍崗，比惠城，博羅城沒有價値的呀！那裏在平日巳是政府鞭長莫及而又是抗敵工作做得不好的地方，×人的殘暴，×人施用了狡奸的鬼計，同胞們的悽慘，災害的嚴重，相信都有特殊的血淚，這便是人所急欲嗎得的！</p>
<p>二，上層的訪問，還不能明白下層的民情：是的，許多的災情統訐呀，施政計劃呀，都要靠機關府給我們雖是比較完整一些的，然而那是片面的，斷不能包藏所有的，何况官樣文章自古流傳？所以，我們必須和老百姓親近，在他們的坦白流吐中得到眞實的事體，因爲他們在×人來了還是周旋在×人的左右的，對失陷中的千奇百怪，眞是我們夢想不到的。眼前還傳誦着許多奇離的傳說，的確是不可放棄的材料了。這就是眞實現象的反映啊！</p>
<p>三，因表面而忽略蘊藏的痛苦：如果單單寫出某某地燒了幾間屋，某某地死了多少人，什麼「景狀十分悽凉」呀，「血骨遍地」呀等等空洞的詞句，至多也不過一時激憤人家而巳！至於千畝低頭黃穗都給敵人驢馬食盡而沒有收成的農民，當敵人佔據時已受維持會的漢奸們的威迫和恐嚇，現在又受許多拿了政府或武裝部隊的名義來明詐暗榨，强抽硬取，他們挨不住了，於是氣憤地說：「媽的，遭了『洋』×××的害，又來遭這般『土』×××仔的氣」？明眼人當然知道，他們這些話完全是由于他們捱得太辛苦了。東江各地的土匪又漸漸忘記了「×××給我們亡國滅種的痛苦」，抗日救亡的心又痲木地改變了，想着在老百姓身上剝刮來安樂自己了，我們都要暴露這些。</p>
<p>四，東江的賭博，以及東江的走私，東江各團體間多少總免不磨擦的現象，我們都該坦白的公王的指出；給救亡的同志們注意，還給上級的政府機關所知道。</p>
<p>還有……</p>
<p>上述種種，是我們做得不够，也許我們到現在還不甚注意到的。固然有多少原因來限制了我們，阻止了我們，好像有許多地方的治安不太平，有許多地方的交通來往太不容易，而我們到來東江的日子實在很短。</p>
<p>總之，以往我們是少連擊，各做各事，各行各路，那我們的責任就此負得不够了。</p>
<p>以後，我們要組織起來，聯合起來，匯通了大家底見解，那麽，問題便可像廚夫剝春筍，一層層的解决了！東江有它革命的傳統，東江還是×人送×命的好地方。我們在東江，有推動一切的天職。</p>
<p>末了，我順便在此先來響應「東江記者大團結起來」的號召，作爲殷切期望的熱忱。　一九三九，二，三。</p>
<h3>流浪曲</h3>
<p>— 袁水拍</p>
<p>哭泣是不够的，多餘的。</p>
<p>在異城的階下，你流浪人。閃光的地板，赭色的單唇，不生長憐憫，而且憐憫是不足貴的。</p>
<p>淚水不能孕育，那個城，那個村，綠的家園，多產的田，河道，與你的鄕親，像你夢寐中的，埋葬了的。被黑色的塵土所擺葬，當　翅的鳥殺人如革。暴戾的瘋狂……淚水不能洗淸這些，要這塊土地適宜人居住，要更濃厚的　的，有色的流體。</p>

<h3>The Future of Our Country's Resistance</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhenhuan</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou and the planned abandonment of Wuhan, the people of our country have been speculating a lot about the future of the resistance. People with common sense all understand that the deeper the × people go, the more advantageous it is for us; the wider the battlefront expands, the more dispersed the × people's forces become, and the more difficult it becomes for them. Not only do we not harbor pessimism, but we also believe that this is a future in which resistance is bound to win. However, up to now, there are still a few who suffer from "fear of Japan" and are taking advantage of our military setbacks to continue spreading rumors of defeatism, attempting to shake our central government's determination to resist and turn our sacred national liberation struggle into compromise and surrender, so that they can establish a puppet regime under the protection of Japanese imperialist force. This is worthy of our attention! I am writing this paper to give a clear and correct answer to this question from all aspects.</p>
<p>Naturally, in its continued progress, our resistance still contains many difficult and arduous factors, especially from the surface, we still seem to be trapped in a very large crisis. However, the problem is by no means so simple: the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War cannot be seen from the surface, but must be determined by comparing the social and economic structures of the two nations; moreover, it cannot be determined in isolation by comparing China and Japan alone, but must be linked to the trends of international politics and economics in order to reach a final determination. That is to say, we cannot estimate this war from form, but must estimate it from substance. We cannot isolate the Sino-Japanese War from world relations and examine it, but must examine it as a part of the whole of world relations, and then we can obtain a correct understanding.</p>
<p>First, judging from the nature of this resistance, our resistance is neither a feudal civil war launched for the benefit of a few feudal warlords, nor an imperialist war launched for the benefit of a few capitalists, but a national liberation revolutionary war launched by every person of the entire Chinese nation for their own survival, the survival of the country, and the survival of the race. Japan, on the contrary, for the benefit of a few capitalists and landlords, drives a large number of the laboring masses, directly and indirectly, onto the line of death in an aggressive war. The longer the aggressive war lasts, the more it will be impossible to sustain due to the awakening of the broad laboring masses, until it reaches the inevitable failure of the war. Conversely, our anti-aggression national revolutionary war will become more and more awakened by the people, the more heroic to resist, and the more able to guarantee the final victory. Regarding this point, the example of Turkey in the past has definitely proven it. China has gradually overcome its previous weaknesses, and the growth of this power is not a problem. Facts have proven that the resistance of the past ten months has already shown an unprecedented awakening of our nation, created an unprecedented great unity of our nation, formed the unity of our national regime and national army, improved our nation's confidence in final victory, strengthened the spirit of our soldiers to sacrifice to the end, and also considerably hit ×××××× and despicable dreams, and thereby won the sympathy and assistance of the working masses and peace-loving countries all over the world. These are all proofs of the inevitable victory that has been brought out from our nation's self-reliance.</p>
<p>Second, our international environment is now developing in a favorable direction day by day. In these few months, we can see from all aspects that many facts that are beneficial to us are developing vigorously. We can summarize these facts into several aspects: (A) The internationalization of the anti-Japanese movements of the laboring masses and progressive political parties of various countries. They not only economically hit Japanese × products everywhere, but also refused to load and unload them, and politically urged their governments to implement effective sanctions against Japan. These movements were first launched in the United Kingdom and its colonies, and have now spread to any region in the world—except Germany and Italy. The great international anti-aggression conference held in London last winter was a general demonstration by peace-loving people all over the world against aggressionism. (B) Peace-loving democratic countries all over the world, such as Britain, the United States, and France, have gradually abandoned their isolationist policies and wait-and-see attitudes since President Roosevelt's famous speech was published, and have formed an international peace front against aggressionism. They deeply know that peace cannot be divided, and to guarantee world peace, it is necessary to guarantee peace in the Far East. Therefore, they have repeatedly used the collective security mechanism of the League of Nations, as well as specially convened the Nine-Power Conference, to support China. Not long after, Britain held naval exercises in Singapore, and the United States followed suit by resolving to expand its armaments. These facts are all indirectly giving China support. As for the Soviet Union, in essence, it is China's most sincere friend and the strongest fortress supporting human peace. Its support for China's national liberation revolutionary war is its consistent and unchanging stance. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact has given Japanese × another layer of concern. In addition, it uses all diplomatic means to strengthen the collective security system; consolidate the peace front; and universally mobilize the laboring masses and progressive political parties all over the world to give spiritual and material support to China's resistance. Its troops in the Far East have already given Japanese × a huge blow in the Zhanggufeng Incident. In addition, although Germany and Italy directly provide assistance to Japanese ×, they cannot do anything with the constraints of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Moreover, there are also mutual contradictions between them. Once Japanese ×'s aggression against China exceeds the limits they hope for, the aggression front itself is not without the possibility of disintegration. (C) The sympathy and assistance of the nationalities in various colonies for China is also becoming more and more widespread day by day. For example, the Union of South Africa and Australia, especially India and the Dutch East Indies, have launched economic sanctions against Japan, causing Japanese ×'s foreign trade to almost come to a standstill. They deeply know that the victory of China's resistance is a powerful prerequisite for the success of the ×× land revolution, and China's liberation is the most important link in the world ×× land liberation movement. Combining the above points, we can recognize and believe that we are fighting in an absolutely favorable international environment. It is very certain that this struggle will achieve victory. Moreover, the recent establishment of credit guarantee loans by Britain and the United States clearly shows that they are helping us and not allowing Japan to dominate East Asia. If Japanese × still does not realize this, perhaps Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union will unite to implement sanctions against this powerful × country!</p>
<p>Third, let us analyze our × people in detail again: Japanese × looks like a strong capitalist country on the surface, but if we carefully analyze its content, we can immediately see that it is a fragile country with congenital deficiencies. It lacks all the resources to build "aggressionism." The reason why it was able to complete the institutions of a capitalist country in just a few decades is entirely due to the use of historical opportunities and geographical advantages, and in these historical opportunities, it desperately carried out plunder wars using geographical advantages, so plunder wars can be regarded as having fulfilled the main task in the development of Japanese capitalism. It first obtained a large amount of monetary compensation and land cession in the Russo-Japanese War and the Sino-Japanese War, which formed the foundation of Japanese capitalism. Later, it used the opportunity of World War I to elevate itself to the stage of imperialism.</p>
<p>However, Japanese capitalism is still the most fragile link in international capitalist countries. Since the outbreak of the world capitalist economic panic in 1929, Japan's economy has fallen into a dead end. Britain, the United States, and other countries can still use economic policies to resolve their crises, but Japan is not qualified for this. It can only use × force to break out a bloody path. This is the reason for its recent active aggression against China, and it is also the reason for launching this large-scale aggression against China. It did not know that this aggression would be met with a bloody response from the Chinese government and people. It thought that it could complete its dream of conquering China in a short period of time, and it never imagined that China's long-term resistance would cause its national economic structure to collapse entirely. From the economic crisis reflected to the political crisis, ×</p>
<p>We know that the survival of Japanese × is entirely built on the invasion of China. However, since the beginning of the war, trade with China has completely stopped. Not only has trade with China stopped, but trade with other countries in the world has also suffered a serious blow from the anti-aggression movement and has been completely reduced. In addition, the orders returned due to the war are 100% in China and more than 50% in various parts of Nanyang. This surplus of foreign trade is completely gone. Secondly, the huge investment in China has also been completely destroyed in the war. For example, the properties of Japanese × in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Hankou have all been turned into ashes. As for the industrial aspect, only military industries are still struggling in Japan, while the remaining textile and gold industries have either encountered difficulties in the source of raw materials or have problems with sales channels, most of which have been completely closed down, and a small part has also greatly reduced production. In the agricultural aspect, the majority of farmers in rural areas have been forced to enlist, reducing the agricultural labor population, and production cannot continue to increase. Moreover, because of the collapse of industry, the sale of agricultural products has been affected, and because of the outflow of cash, the foreign exchange rate has fluctuated. The payment of differences in international trade and the purchase of military supplies all require cash payment; therefore, cash flows out day by day, thus affecting the depreciation of paper money and the fall of all securities. Especially after the closure of industries, the number of unemployed people will inevitably increase day by day. After the depreciation of paper money, the prices of goods on the market will rise, and workers will either be unemployed or have their wages reduced, thus increasing labor-capital conflicts and strike movements day by day. On the other hand, Japanese capitalists and warlords, for the continued progress of the war, still cannot but extract as much as possible from the poor peasants and workers. As far as we know, Japan's budget last year reached 5.47 billion yuan, of which military expenditure accounted for 70% of the total, and now it is more than this. Such a huge number has no second source other than being squeezed out of the Japanese laboring masses. Now the Japanese laboring masses have been squeezed dry. In short, Japan's national finances have lost the solid foundation of the national economy, the national budget has exceeded the extent that the people can bear, and public debt and all kinds of exorbitant taxes have reached the saturation point and can no longer be digested. Therefore, the money and materials extracted have all been squeezed clean, and it has lost the material basis for continuing the war!</p>
<p>Looking at it from the above aspects in summary: First, from the self-reliance of China's resistance itself; second, from the favorable international environment of China's resistance; third, from the economic and political crisis of our × people, we are confident in obtaining the final victory of our resistance. However, it is not enough for us to rely solely on the development of these objective conditions. What is important is that we must make the greatest efforts subjectively. What we should strive for is: First, how to make our strength grow and become stronger in the development of resistance. All theories and actions that are sufficient to hinder this self-reliance must be swept away. Second, how should we establish our victorious diplomatic line, quickly connect with people's organizations and progressive political parties of various countries, and promote them to oppose their governments' isolationist policies and wavering attitudes. Third, how should we get in touch with the oppressed laboring masses inside our × country and strengthen their anti-war movement. Now our resistance has entered a new stage, which can also be said to be a stage close to victory. From the failures of the past year and a half, we have learned many valuable lessons. The previous failures have formed the basis for our future victory. I believe that my assessment of the inevitable victory of our resistance is a correct assessment. As long as each of us holds the determination to fight for national liberation, the final victory will definitely belong to us!</p>
<h3>The Youth Salvation Movement in Chaoshan</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenqiang</p>
<p>Without a unified organization or unified leadership, this was a shortcoming of the Chaoshan Youth Salvation Movement in the past. Originally, the Chaoshan youth had long had the demand for a unified organization. Last year, in January, a representative conference of youth resistance associations from various counties and cities was held in Shantou. It was originally scheduled that the conference of representatives would produce the Lingdong Youth Anti-× Comrades Succession Association, but at that time, the Shantou people's anti-× support association, for some reason, actually sent a letter to the police station to stop the meeting. The conference could not be held, and the general association could not be produced. Only three people were selected by the representatives in an informal meeting to organize the Lingdong Youth Anti-× Comrades Association Correspondence Office as a substitute for the general association. However, due to the overly simple organization, the Lingqing Correspondence Office at that time could not assume the responsibility of leadership, and the Chaoshan youth were still working in a scattered situation.</p>
<p>China's politics have progressed with the development of the War of Resistance. Last year, on the anniversary of August 13th, the Chaoshan Youth Resistance Association's representative conference was actually held under the leadership of party, government, and military officers. Although the Youth Resistance General Association has not yet been successfully organized, the organization of the Lingqing Correspondence Office has been improved and has become a truly leading organ of the Chaoshan Youth Salvation Movement. At the same time, the Youth Resistance Associations in various counties have also been unified. Affiliated relationships have developed from counties to districts, and from districts to villages; the village Youth Resistance accepts the leadership of the district Youth Resistance, the district Youth Resistance accepts the leadership of the county Youth Resistance, and the county Youth Resistance accepts the leadership of the Lingqing Correspondence Office. The Chaoshan Youth Salvation Movement has been unified since then.</p>
<p>Cultivating Cadres and Allocating Cadres</p>
<p>"Cadres decide everything," this is a famous saying containing truth, tasted from the rich experience of revolutionary struggle. The developmental form of the Chaoshan Youth Salvation Movement is determined by the cadres. Therefore, the Chaoshan youth in the struggle pay extremely close attention to the cultivation of cadres.</p>
<p>Only youth forged in struggle can become a strong and capable cadre. Chaoshan youth have always cultivated cadres through practical work. In 1937, two work teams were organized to follow the army. One was a work team stationed with the 155th Division in Chaoshan, and the other was a work team going north with the army, following the 156th Division to work on the eastern battlefield. The purpose of organizing the two work teams was to take on the responsibility of bridging the military and the people, filling the past gap between the military and the people, so that the military and the people could cooperate closely, rise up together, and eliminate × people. At the same time, taking advantage of the convenience of following the army, the masses were more widely and deeply awakened and organized. The work team going north with the army was disbanded and returned after the fall of Nanjing. The work team following the 155th Division was changed to the work team following the 157th Division since the 157th Division took over Chaoshan last February, and was also announced to be disbanded this April due to economic reasons. The achievements of the above two work teams are of course indelible, and it is especially valuable that each team member has been forged into a strong cadre in the work.</p>
<p>In order to obtain richer struggle experience, the Chaoshan youth especially encouraged a large number of comrades to go to the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in northern Shaanxi to study. Go to the New Fourth Army to participate in guerrilla warfare. They have enriched their experience and strengthened their abilities in actual struggles in the Northwest and Jiangnan. When the Anti-Japanese War in Chaoshan needs them, they will come back to defend their hometown, because working in their hometown can exert more power.</p>
<p>In addition to cultivating cadres through work, Chaoshan youth can also seize every opportunity for short-term special training. Various training classes held by the government, such as the Civil Movement Work Cadre Training Class of the Guangdong Party, Government, and Military Joint Conference, the Self-Defense Personnel Cadre Training Institute and Women's Cadre Training Institute of the Eighth District Self-Defense Corps Command Office, the Training Corps of the Ninth District Self-Defense Corps, and the War Zone Service Corps of the 157th Division, the Youth Resistance Associations in various places in Chaoshan have planned to send members to participate in the training, so that they can become cadres with special skills and trusted by the government.</p>
<p>Another purpose of members of the Youth Resistance Association participating in various cadre trainings is to allocate cadres. The purpose of various training classes held by the government is to cultivate cadre talents for various civil movement work, and after graduation, they are assigned to work in various places. This will disperse the members of the Youth Association to various places, stand in a legal position, directly lead the broad masses, and earnestly implement all the government's anti-war orders.</p>
<p>Difficulties Felt</p>
<p>In a representative meeting, dozens of representatives of the Youth Resistance Associations of various counties and cities in Chaoshan gathered to report the difficulties in the progress of the Youth Resistance Associations in various places. Summarizing, there are roughly the following points: 1. Obstruction by feudal forces; 2. Lack of cadres; 3. Financial difficulties. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Protesting × Invasion of Hainan Island, Britain and France Discuss Unified Attitude, Several French Warships Arrive at Haikou, French Ambassador Questions Japan's Intentions</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 11th] The French Foreign Ministry received definite information this afternoon that French warships are still anchored off Hainan Island and will be able to clearly understand all circumstances when the Japanese land. At present, Britain and France are discussing how to lodge a protest with Japan.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 11th] According to reliable sources, the French government has instructed the French ambassador in Tokyo to ask the Japanese government about the period of stationing of Japanese troops on Hainan Island and the extent of military operations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 11th] Regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, the French government had not yet decided last night whether to lodge a direct and separate protest, or to issue a "diplomatic declaration," or to coordinate with Britain and jointly protest to Japan. According to official sources, France currently does not seem to want to "cause trouble," but only to lodge a protest with Japan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 11th] French officials stated that France is currently working to avoid and eliminate the threat of German and Italian forces to its European territories, and the sudden occupation of Hainan Island by the Japanese army has made France even more difficult and anxious. At present, the number of warships stationed in Annam by France is not large, and the military strength is only about 35,000 people. The Foreign Minister stated last week that France is determined to do its best to protect its interests in various places, so this matter has attracted the attention of the general public. The Foreign Ministry is studying reports from all parties in detail.</p>
<p>[Local News] According to the De Chen Western Newspaper in Hong Kong yesterday morning, a radio report was received yesterday morning that several French warships had arrived at Haikou, the number and type of which are unknown, but all seemed to be from Guangzhou Bay.</p>
<p>Britain and France Take Consistent Action, French Opinion Leaders Make Suggestions to the Government</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] French newspapers have recently launched major attacks on the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. They suggested that France should cooperate with Britain and lodge a serious protest with Tokyo. The "News" stated that Britain and France should take joint defensive actions in the Far East. Several other newspapers pointed out that the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and the Italian occupation of Milos (located in the Mediterranean) are both "common conspiracies of the Axis powers."</p>
<p>Britain and France Take Consistent Action, French Opinion Leaders Make Suggestions to the Government</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 11th] The newspapers here on Saturday morning carried lengthy articles on the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. According to the Times diplomatic correspondent, the loss of the island affects British and French rights, as navigation to Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay will be restricted. Recalling that in June last year, British Foreign Secretary Butler declared in the House of Lords that the British and French governments had warned Japan that the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island would inevitably cause undesirable conflicts. It also stated that if the situation forced it, Britain and France must provide practical assistance to each other to deal with various disputes. It also stated that the government is currently reviewing whether the Japanese army's occupation of the island affects British and French rights, and whether the Japanese government's guarantee of no territorial ambition can be realized.</p>
<p>British House of Commons to Discuss, Members Plan to Ensure Government Takes Clear Action</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 11th] British officials do not want to make any criticisms regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island before receiving accurate reports. However, officials said that since Japan first threatened Hainan Island last June, Japan has repeatedly hinted that Japan would inevitably use military reasons as an excuse to land on Hainan Island sooner or later. However, Japan stated every time it hinted that Japan had no intention of permanently occupying the island. Japan's actions this time will inevitably arouse opposition from the British and French Houses of Commons. According to reports, some members of the British House of Commons do not pay much attention to Far Eastern events, but they are particularly concerned about the integrity of Hainan Island. The issue of the Japanese army's occupation of the island is expected to be raised for discussion in the House of Commons next Monday. It is heard that members will urge the government to immediately take clear action to implement the resolutions submitted by Britain and France to Japan last year. It is still recalled that after Japan first threatened Hainan Island last year, France immediately dispatched troops to occupy the islands under its jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Qiongya's Isolated Army Fights Hard, × Suffers Fierce Resistance</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou Bay, 11th] Foreign News. Late last night, a telegram came to Haikou, officially confirming that Japanese troops had occupied Haikou and Qiongzhou on Hainan Island. At dawn yesterday, Japanese troops landed at Lingao, west of Haikou, and Qinglan Port, southeast of it. Immediately, a fierce battle broke out between the Chinese and Japanese armies. Although the number of Chinese defenders was small, they resolutely defended the key points to resist, waiting for reinforcements from Qiongzhou. It is difficult for Hong Kong to transmit that the × army suffered deaths, but according to reliable sources here, the × naval landing force reached Lin Gao, and at least 100 people have died. Before the Chinese army retreated to the island, they continued to shoot at the Japanese army with machine guns. On the Qinglan Port side, the Chinese army also resolutely resisted, and both sides suffered casualties. When the Japanese army landed, in addition to the battleships firing artillery, Japanese planes also launched large-scale attacks. After the Japanese army landed, they used trucks to attack Qiongzhou along the highway. The Chinese army in Qiongzhou bravely resisted with small field guns and machine guns, but due to the small number of people, they had to retreat to the interior. Japanese planes carried out large-scale bombing in Haikou and Qiongzhou. It was reported last night that several houses caught fire, and the situation in the city was very chaotic. Residents moved to the interior one after another, leaving many items along the way.</p>
<p>[Guangzhou Bay, 11th] Foreign News. This morning, the wireless here received news that shelling could still be heard in Haikou, and many believed that the Chinese army was still resisting in the suburbs of Haikou and Qiongzhou.</p>

<h3>Intentionally Making Things Difficult for France</h3>
<p>—American Observer—</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 11th] Since the news of the Japanese army landing on Hainan Island was transmitted, people here are quite surprised, as it was generally believed that there had been a recent understanding between Japan and France. That is, the French side agreed to prevent Chinese military supplies from being transported through Annam, while the Japanese side agreed to guarantee the neutrality of Hainan Island. The Chinese authorities have long expressed dissatisfaction with Annam's prevention of Chinese military supplies from passing through, and overseas Chinese in Annam have also strongly opposed this matter. People here believe that the Japanese army's move is actually intended to make things difficult for France.</p>
<h3>He Guoguang Takes Office, Flies to Chengdu Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 11th] He Guoguang, Director of the Chairman's Chengdu Provisional Headquarters, along with his entourage, left Chongqing at approximately 9:00 AM on the 11th to fly to Chengdu to take office.</p>
<h3>Muli Tusi Representatives Fly to Chongqing to Present Flag, Jin Citizens Pay Respects to Senior Officials, Long Yun Issues Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kunming, 11th Special Dispatch] The Muli Tusi has decided to send representatives to Chongqing to present a flag to the leader and the frontline soldiers to pay their respects.

Representatives were sent to pay respects to the Commander-in-Chief, who personally received them. In addition to expressing his gratitude, he gave a speech to the people, declaring his determination to resist and his grasp of the final victory, and encouraged military-civilian cooperation and united resistance until the end.</p>
<h3>× Invasion of Hainan Island, US Government Attaches Great Importance, Defense Experts Study Western Pacific Situation, Defense Plans for Philippine Islands and Guam May Be Strengthened</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 11th] According to US defense experts, if Japan establishes naval and air force bases on Hainan Island, then the new US defense plans for the Philippine Islands and Guam should be reconsidered. It is generally believed that the Japanese military's move is sufficient to encourage the American people to be more sympathetic to the government's plan to defend Guam in order to protect the Philippines. On the other hand, some people believe that the Japanese military's move is intended to coerce various countries to readjust the situation in the Pacific and stop the Sino-Japanese War. Perhaps the Japanese side wants to use this to coerce the United States to stop defending Guam. The US government is unwilling to comment until the true purpose of the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island is clear, as it is questionable whether the Japanese military will permanently occupy the island. If the Japanese military permanently occupies the island and establishes naval and air force bases on the island, US officials believe that the Philippines, Annam, and Hong Kong will all be threatened, and the military situation in the Western Pacific will need to be readjusted.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 10th] The US government is unwilling to criticize the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island until the Japanese side declares its true purpose and whether Japan will permanently occupy the island. However, if Japan develops a naval base on Hainan Island, the military positions of the Western Pacific powers will be drastically changed as a result. Therefore, the air force base will pose a threat to the Philippines, Annam, and Hong Kong. However, some officials believe that the Japanese military's occupation of Hainan Island is similar to its occupation of Shanghai and Guangzhou, that is, although it infringes on the interests of Western powers, it may not infringe on the sovereignty of the powers. However, if Japan permanently occupies the island in order to drive out Western forces, the situation will be very different.</p>
<h3>Twelfth Group Army Attacks × with Surprise Troops</h3>
<p>[Wengyuan Quick Report] A certain division of the 12th Group Army dispatched troops on the night of the 5th to attack × from Honghe in separate directions towards Zhongluotan and Taipingchang. The First Battalion advanced to the vicinity of Zhongluotan at 1:00 AM on the 6th, bravely attacking and breaking into a corner of the ×'s position. The × troops responded in a panic and were extremely chaotic. Subsequently, the × troops transported more than 300 × soldiers from the Taihe City area in armored vehicles to reinforce them. For a time, the battle became more intense. Our army bravely charged and killed more than 100 × officers and soldiers, and the ×'s momentum was thwarted. After a stalemate until dawn, our army burned the ferry barracks and bridges near the ×'s position and withdrew to its original position. In this battle, our company commander Fang Zhongping was killed, company commander Lao Yaoming was wounded, and more than 20 soldiers were wounded. The Second Battalion advanced to the vicinity of Taipingchang at 3:00 AM on the 6th, catching the × by surprise and launching a fierce attack on them. The × stubbornly resisted by relying on nets, firing artillery aimlessly at us all night, firing a total of five or six hundred rounds. We believed that the purpose of depleting the × people had been achieved, and we also safely withdrew to our original position before dawn.</p>
<h3>Philippine Compatriots Respond to "One Yuan to Repay Debt" with Honor, $100,000 USD Remitted to Chongqing</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila, 11th] Yang Guangsheng, the Chinese Consul General here, announced today that he has remitted $100,000 USD to Chongqing as a repayment of the US loan for Chinese export credit.

<h3>American Dockworkers Help Us Sanction Japanese ×, National Diplomacy Association Sends Telegram to Thank Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 11th] Two cargo ships in the Long Beach port of California, USA, previously planned to load 1,200 tons of scrap iron to Japan, but the dockworkers refused to transport the scrap iron onto the ships. Several thousand workers also set up a cordon at the dock. The Chinese National Diplomacy Association recently sent a telegram to express its gratitude and hopes to continue its efforts to unite dockworkers across the United States to expand this movement.</p>
<h3>American Residents in Chongqing Send Telegram to Roosevelt, Requesting to Stop Atrocities</h3>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 11th] American residents here recently jointly sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Senators Pittman and Reynolds, requesting that they stop the Japanese from indiscriminately bombing China. The original telegram stated: "Japanese bombing of Guiyang and Wanxian, the use of incendiary bombs, thousands of innocent civilians were burned to death, and women and children were strafed by machine guns. The past policy of the United States, following the same old routine, is tantamount to participating in the crimes of Japan. In the name of humanity and world peace, we ask you to quickly stop the export of oil, iron, and other materials to Japan."</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General in Shanghai Protests to French Consul, Requests Interference in Concession Administration, Stepped Up Arrests of Patriotic Elements</h3>
<p>[United Press Shanghai, 11th] The Japanese Consul General here has made an oral request to the French Consul General, requesting the French Concession authorities to step up efforts to eliminate terrorists within the Concession, as terrorists have been extremely active in the past two weeks, killing many pro-Japanese puppet officials. It is reported that the French authorities replied that some shootings occurred in Japanese-occupied areas and hoped that the Japanese authorities would pay special attention to them.</p>
<h3>× Izumo Battleship Violently Hit by French Ship, Chrysanthemum Crest on Bow Destroyed, Anchor Cable Broken</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch, the Japanese flagship Izumo nearly met with an accident in the Huangpu River today. At 4:00 PM today, the French merchant ship Asushima No. 2 sailed into the Huangpu River and, due to a navigational error, violently collided with the front of the Izumo battleship. The gold chrysanthemum crest on the bow was destroyed, and the anchor cable was also broken. Fortunately, the battleship immediately dropped another spare anchor, thus avoiding danger. According to reports, the French ship was sailing from the port to this area when it saw a sailboat sailing straight towards the engine of the ship. The ship stopped the engine's rotation for fear of an accident. Unexpectedly, the ship leaned over and could not be stopped. A hole was pierced in the starboard side of the stern of the Asushima No. 2. Afterwards, the shipowner, Mr. Kilin, personally boarded the Japanese battleship to apologize.</p>
<h3>Old Mr. Wang Delin, Who Died of Illness at the Front</h3>
<p>— Liu Qiguang</p>
<p>(Xi'an Aviation News)</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Wang Delin, everyone will immediately think of the Northeast Volunteer Army, because he was one of the four leaders of the Northeast Volunteer Army that year. Moreover, he was different from the senior military officers turned volunteer army leaders such as Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Li Du. He was a grassroots hero who rose from the bottom and, with a call to arms, won the support of more than 100,000 sons and daughters of the borderland who were unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation. He had never read books, did not understand politics, had no airs, and was a thorough country old man in appearance. He was a good man to people, but a ball of fire to things. He didn't know what political parties were, let alone why "brothers should quarrel." He only knew, "We are Chinese, and Chinese should love China." If someone infringes on China's interests, it is his irreconcilable enemy. When Imperial Russia laid the Chinese Eastern Railway and invaded China, he once led troops to resist, causing the Tsarist government to send envoys to seek peace before giving up. However, if he knew that Russians had bullied Chinese compatriots, traffic on the Chinese Eastern Railway would usually be disrupted. Later, he helped the Bolshevik Party to eliminate the White Russians on the opposite bank of the Heilongjiang River. His only motive was to take the opportunity to retaliate against Imperial Russia, which had bullied the Chinese people. In fact, he did not know what the political position of the Bolshevik Party was, let alone approve of the revolution. His great sense of loving the country and loving his compatriots always controlled his lifelong behavior. Therefore, although he had been a ×× for more than ten years and had a strong influence along the Heilongjiang River, the local people never had any resentment towards him. The generous gifts that the Tsarist government sent him every season not only became the supplies for his subordinates but also became the food and clothing for the local poor. After the September 18th Incident, he disregarded everything and rose up to resist Japan, which was also the highest expression of his innate patriotism.</p>
<p>This admirable national hero has already bid farewell to his 450 million compatriots. He died in a guerrilla base behind the Japanese lines. Attending to him in his dying moments were forty to fifty of his close followers from Qilu who were unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation. Under the armed guard of his subordinates and under the constant threat of the Japanese, he ended his 64-year life. When he was on his last breath, he muttered, "× his mother, don't let a single × soldier go back."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang died. Mr. Wang, who first launched the war of resistance after the September 18th Incident, died for the survival of the country and the dignity of the nation. However, his lifelong spirit of unremitting struggle for the country and the nation will last forever. Inheriting this great spiritual heritage and sacrificing everything for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the country and the nation should be the inescapable responsibility of every Chinese son and daughter who dies later!</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Delin started the Anti-Japanese War about a month after the September 18th Incident. At that time, he was a battalion commander of the Jilin Provincial Defense Army, stationed near Yanji, Jilin, bordering Korea. After the Japanese occupied the Northeast, for strategic needs, they wanted to build a railway from Huining, Korea, to Yanji. The route predetermined by the Japanese happened to pass through Mr. Wang's defense area. At that time, the Japanese still thought that the Chinese could be bought with money and status, so they sent personnel to visit Mr. Wang at the defense post, respectfully sending a large number of gifts, and promised that after the completion of the Jihui Road, Mr. Wang would be promoted to the position of "Road Protection Commander." Mr. Wang pretended to agree. The next day, more than 200 Japanese soldiers escorted the survey team to start surveying the route. Mr. Wang took advantage of the Japanese's unpreparedness and mobilized his troops to surround the Japanese closely, firing the first shot of the Anti-Japanese War and sacrificing more than 200 Japanese as a flag sacrifice. Thus, he continued to fight with the Japanese army that was "suppressing bandits" until the first month of the 21st year. The Japanese not only failed to eliminate his strength but instead increased his strength from four or five hundred people to seventy or eighty thousand people. At this time, Mr. Wang was supported by everyone as the "Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese National Salvation Army" and fought in the territory of Jilin. The following winter, his troops had increased to 150,000 to 160,000, and the defense area was gradually forced to move from southeastern Jilin to the northeast. Finally, due to the lack of military supplies and the difficulty in supplying the soldiers, he was defeated and entered Soviet territory under the large-scale attack of the Japanese. Although Mr. Wang failed, more than 100,000 Northeast soldiers under his leadership still broke up into smaller units and remained in various parts of the Northeast to continue the Anti-Japanese War. The current leaders of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, such as Zhou ××, Li ××, Wu ××, and Wang ××, were all cadres who followed him in the past.</p>
<p>In June of the 23rd year, Mr. Wang returned to China via Europe. Wherever he passed, he received a warm welcome from all walks of life, especially from overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang. In July, he assumed the new post of Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army in Guangzhou. In September, he left Guangzhou for Shanghai, running around Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, planning to take a boat to Vladivostok and return to the Northeast to continue leading the Anti-Japanese War. Due to various reasons, he was unable to succeed. Later, he was appointed as a consultant to the Military Affairs Commission and lived in Nanjing for a short time. However, his enthusiasm for the Anti-Japanese War never wavered. While in Nanjing, he twice met with the Soviet Ambassador to discuss the possibility of passing through the Soviet Union, but he was unable to fulfill his wish.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was very poor. When he was in Nanjing, his family of seven and more than ten followers were crowded into a flat of 25 yuan a month. For daily life, in addition to the 90-odd yuan a month for travel expenses from the Electric Power Committee, there was a subsidy of 150 yuan a month from the Northeast Salvation Association. In the winter of the 25th year, the old troops who had retreated into Soviet territory with him returned from Vladivostok in a steady stream, and they all lived on the floor of Mr. Wang's residence, sending away one batch after another, simply exhausting him to the point where he could not even afford rice porridge. Fortunately, the old troops who returned to China later were all sent back to their hometowns by the Military Affairs Commission, so he was able to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Suiyuan-East, Mr. Wang was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, unable to settle down for a moment. "× his mother, ×× are getting more and more fierce. Are the Chinese people so uncompetitive? × his mother, we have to do it, we have to do it!" He always said this to every friend he met.</p>
<p>He had a very close relationship with Mr. Ma Xiangbo and Mr. Ding Weifen. Later, with their assistance, he took two followers and rushed to Suiyuan. He originally wanted to return to Jilin via Rehe from Suiyuan to lead his old troops to respond to the Anti-Japanese War. When he arrived in Guihua and met with General Fu Zuoyi, he learned that the Suiyuan War had ended in victory. He could not realize his wish to return to the Northeast for the time being. After visiting the officers and soldiers who participated in the Anti-Japanese War at that time, he quickly returned to Beiping.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Beiping, at the invitation of Mr. Song Zheyuan, he stayed in the old capital and was appointed as an advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. While in Beiping, he sent people back to the Northeast to make contact, and the old troops outside the pass often sent people to Guan to report everything. At that time, he still tried every means to get out of Guan, but he never achieved his goal.</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident, he immediately sent people back to Shandong to recruit the old troops who had returned from Saibei in preparation for the Anti-Japanese War. However, unexpectedly, Tianjin and Beiping were abandoned, and the old man was left in Beiping, exposed to the direct threat of the brutal ××. At that time, his friends believed that the situation was ominous and tried to rescue him in every possible way, but his whereabouts were never known. Later, he disguised himself and escaped back to Nanjing in September.</p>
<p>In October, the Northeast ×× was established in Zhengzhou. At the urging of Chen ××, Mr. Wang took over as the Commander-in-Chief of the Second ×× Region's Restoration Army and once again prepared to go out of Guan to kill ×. Unfortunately, the ×× ended immediately, and Mr. Wang's plan had to be postponed again.</p>
<p>After countless failures, he knew that his wish to go out of Guan could not be fulfilled easily, and the situation of the Anti-Japanese War became more and more tense. Finally, he resolutely abandoned his original plan and went from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou, rushing back to his hometown in Yishui, southern Shandong, to gather the children of his hometown and the old troops who had returned from the north to begin guerrilla warfare against the Japanese after Han Fuju abandoned Shandong. At this time, he had no official title and no funds. He led his fellow villagers to fight the Japanese as an ordinary citizen, and his daily life was to supply his subordinates and the elders of his hometown. His subordinate Zhang × was a brave and good at fighting general. During the Anti-Japanese War in the Northeast, he had established the miraculous feat of rushing into the Japanese camp alone and capturing the Japanese captain alive. This tiger general also had brilliant achievements in the guerrilla warfare in southern Shandong.</p>
<p>After the retreat from Xuzhou, General Shi ×× led his troops to station in southern Shandong. At that time, Mr. Wang was suffering from illness due to years of running around and fighting the Anti-Japanese War. He handed over all his troops to Zhang × to be directly commanded by General Shi, and he only took a few close followers back to his relatives' home in Beishizhuang, Nanyong Township, Yishui, to recuperate.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was originally very strong. When he first arrived in Nanjing, although he was already in his twilight years at the age of sixty-one, he did not have a single white hair. However, because his ambition was not fulfilled, his hair turned gray within half a year, and his spirit and body gradually became unsustainable. After suffering from illness in southern Shandong, although he left the army to recuperate, he finally died of a severe attack of old illness on December 20th of last winter due to old age and blood loss.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's name was Huimin. He left Guan at the age of twenty and spent forty years in the Northeast. He knew the geography of the Northeast, especially the two provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin, very well, and he had many friendships with the elders of the area. His wife, Liu Yujie, gave birth to three sons and three daughters, all of whom were young. They are now exiled in Xi'an, living at No. 653 Dongda Street. Mr. Wang was selfless and never considered family life. Now his family of six, widow and orphans, are extremely pitiful. It is hoped that the people of the court and the field will pity the descendants of the national hero who fought with ×× throughout his life and provide them with assistance.

<h3>Special Feature: The New World War (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chen Youren</p>
<p>The empires that Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and militarist-dominated Japan seek to establish can only succeed if the British and French empires collapse, the Soviet Union disintegrates, China is completely conquered and destroyed, and the naval power of the United States in the Pacific is eliminated. Germany has already annexed Austria, dismembered Czechoslovakia, and is now conspiring with Italy to subject Spain to foreign domination in a way that Spain has never seen before in its history. Italy has also conquered Abyssinia and forced Britain and France to recognize the conquered territory in a humiliating manner unprecedented in their glorious history. Now, it is actively preparing to provoke France formally over the issues of Tunisia, Nice, and Djibouti. As for Japan, it is not only ravaging China but, as Matsuoka Yosuke said, is implementing a policy of excluding white powers from Asia.</p>
<p>This is an explanation of the current world situation. This explanation can make people understand the violence of the aggressor nations, their illegal thoughts and actions, and their contempt for Britain and France—one aggressor nation even happily called Britain and France declining powers.</p>
<p>(6) Concrete Facts</p>
<p>The apparent victories of the aggressor nations and the missteps of British and French politicians, their inability to make decisive decisions, and their diplomatic humiliation can all be proven by concrete facts. When Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese military openly launched wars, and since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, this war has become a new world war. However, on the side of the peaceful nations, they regarded these actions as accidental diplomatic incidents and local struggles, as if they were unrelated to each other, like the people of Qin viewing the fat of the people of Yue. Thus, at the Beijing Conference, French Foreign Minister Daladier only referred to the brutal war of aggression launched by Japan in China as a local struggle!</p>
<p>In other words, Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists are not only launching a world war, but also demonstrating in their actions and decisions the characteristics of historical military leaders. However, London, Paris, and Washington are not seeking ways to win this ongoing war. Sadly, they are still vainly trying to avoid war!</p>
<p>Preparing for a future war and preparing for an offensive in a war are not the same. To illustrate this difference, the last World War was launched in the summer of 1918, but the final offensive by the Allied powers to force Germany to sue for peace cannot be said to have been fully prepared before the summer of 1918. The Allied powers spent four years preparing for their final counter-offensive. Now, General Göring of Germany has been working for four years on the offensive of the totalitarian powers in the current war, which is surprising and noteworthy. According to the views of the Nazi and Fascist military, this war must be sudden, with a significant disparity in strength, and can be resolved in a short period.</p>
<p>(7) Fear Psychology</p>
<p>Is the democratic countries' failure to grasp the great reality of this new world war due to the fact that the previous European war has given British and French politicians moral or psychological trauma? Or is it that the democratic countries of greater Europe cannot produce leaders like Hitler, Mussolini, and the militarists of the Tokyo Shogunate? Are Hitler, Mussolini, and Itagaki truly superhuman beings beyond the reach of ordinary people?</p>
<p>No, Hitler and Mussolini are not particularly sound. However, when the leaders of the democratic countries loathe war and have an extreme fear of war—to the extent that they do not believe things they dare not believe—Hitler and others seized upon the mistakes of others and were able to step onto the stage of history.</p>
<p>This fear psychology led British and French politicians to misunderstand the historical facts created by Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists, and they continued to suggest to them things like "overall solutions," "gentlemen's agreements," and "international concessions" to discuss what they called unfair issues. Hitler and others want to create their new empire with the Nazi blade, the Fascist aircraft, and the methods of Japanese barbarism. This will to create a new empire is certainly not something that can be controlled by diplomatic rhetoric and political fantasies.</p>
<p>(8) Non-Intervention Policy</p>
<p>What is more striking to people's intellect than the British and French policy of non-intervention in the Spanish war? German and Italian troops have invaded Spain, and according to Mussolini and the recent speech by the U.S. Secretary of State, the mission of the German and Italian troops is to overthrow democratic Spain. However, for the past two years, London and Paris have avoided mentioning the existence of these troops, in order to prove that their so-called non-intervention policy can avoid war—in fact, war would not have occurred if the combined strength of Germany and Italy could not have consistently matched the combined strength of the three major democratic powers of Britain, France, and Russia.</p>
<p>With the same purpose as the above commentary, let me criticize the attitude of the Western democratic countries towards the Japanese invasion of China. A year ago, I gave a speech in Paris, and I could not help but say to the audience: "Please forgive me, from the standpoint of a Chinese person, I feel that the principles adopted by the Western democratic countries are vulgar, foolish, selfish, and self-serving principles. Not only Britain and France are like this, but also the policy of the United States is the same. They all believe that the work of slaughter by Japan in China is only an undeclared local struggle, and that their interests are not related. Although more than 300,000 Chinese lives have been killed by Japanese aircraft and artillery, and tens of thousands of Chinese women have given birth to children on the streets of Shanghai and other open places, the principle of non-intervention must be observed if the interests of Britain, France, and the United States are not harmed. The suffering of the Chinese people is indeed difficult to calculate. In addition to the above, according to the Director of Intelligence of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, there are also 30 million Chinese people in the Shanghai-Nanjing area who are homeless in this severe winter. Think about it; 30 million Chinese people, equal to a quarter of the entire US population and three-quarters of the entire French population, are ravaged by cruel [omitted characters], causing them to be displaced!" Since I gave my speech in Paris, more than one million Chinese people have been massacred by the Japanese army, and more than 60 million have been displaced.</p>

It is rumored that the Director of Counter-Espionage of the Spanish government, Domingo, arrived in Murcia via Catalonia. It is also reported that a ship from Minorca carrying about 100 Spanish government officials arrived in North Algeria last night and will transfer to Aran. Also, after Spanish Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo arrived in Valencia, they used a radio broadcast to appeal to the people of the whole country, while announcing the government's return to Madrid, and saying that no matter how difficult it is, they must continue the resistance to defend Spanish liberalism.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Perpignan, 10th] The Spanish rebel army occupied Puigcerdà this afternoon. The town is still on fire. The rebels then occupied Bellver de Cerdanya.

<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] American Ambassador to Britain Joseph P. Kennedy, before returning to his post on the "Queen Mary," declared that he had spoken with President Roosevelt for two hours. He denied the rumor that on the 10th of last month, he and Ambassador to France William Christian Bullitt attended a meeting of the Congressional Military Committee and predicted that war would break out this spring. He said, "I have never predicted war. When I returned from Europe last time, I reported to you that I do not predict the stock market or diplomatic events. I am not a prophet, so I would not predict war." When asked if his return to Britain this time was related to the situation in Spain, he replied, "I am only returning to my post."</p>

<h3>A Quarrelsome Couple. Actress Joan Crawford Requests a Divorce from Her Husband.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Los Angeles, 11th] Famous film actress Joan Crawford has filed a petition with the court to divorce her husband, actor Franchot Tone. However, we should still remember that in mid-July last year, the two had a joint separation statement.</p>
<h3>Britain's Naval and Air Forces are Sufficient to Deal with Invasion. Home Secretary Hoare Delivers a Speech. Chamberlain's Declaration is a Roar.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] British Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare (see photo) delivered a speech in Plymouth today, saying that "The British government does not want to adopt policies towards its colonies that are of no benefit to anyone." He said that he had clearly explained the issue of world raw material supply at the Geneva conference, and that explanation can still represent the government's views. If the issue of raw material supply is indeed sufficient to cause future disputes, he really does not understand why this issue and all commercial issues cannot be resolved through negotiations and discussions. Speaking of Prime Minister Chamberlain's guarantee to France, Hoare said, "This remark is by no means as weak and powerless as the opponents say, but is actually the roar of those who are determined to maintain world peace. Its purpose is not only to maintain the broad interests of the British Empire, but also to maintain the interests of countries that are closely related to Britain." Based on the experience of the Great War and the great progress made after the war, he believes that Britain will no longer be in danger of being threatened by submarines as it was during the Great War. He said that since the crisis in September last year, British aircraft manufacturing has made great strides. To this day, the British Air Force is sufficient to deal with any aggressor. He concluded, "We dare to say that our country is now safer than before. We believe that there is no reason to be pessimistic about the current situation of national defense and the international situation."</p>
<h3>Another Large Batch of European Gold Shipped to America.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Recently, another large batch of gold from Europe has arrived in the United States. The last batch, about $60,000,000, has been deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank. The bank's foreign gold reserves are now over $600,000,000. Most of it came from Britain. Although the reason given on the surface is to stabilize the exchange rate, such a large amount is not really necessary. Its intention is obviously somewhere else. According to Wall Street financial circles, it is speculated that European countries may want to deposit gold in the United States as a reserve fund, so that in the event of war, they can purchase supplies and various raw materials in accordance with the principle of cash purchase and self-responsibility for transportation. The danger of transporting gold at that time will thus be avoided.</p>
<h3>(Continued from page 3) "The New World War"</h3>
<p>(9) The Main Line of Defense</p>
<p>I continue to say: "Paying attention to Japan's invasion of China, I hope that the psychology and conscience of Western people will have a more accurate understanding of the actual importance of the Far East dispute, not to regard it as a local struggle, but to recognize it as an important part of the new world war, and to recognize it as the main line of defense of this war. This new world war is the war launched by Germany, Italy, and Japan to create their new empires by force."</p>
<p>Having described all the facts of the international situation as above, my personal opinion is that this new world war is still in a brewing state. In Europe, actual warfare has not yet openly broken out. Therefore, my suggestion is: if we want to prevent this war from brewing into an actual open outbreak, we must immediately, before the totalitarian powers' offensive begins, cause their line of defense in the Far East to collapse and disintegrate.</p>
<p>I believe that an unconquered China is a factor for peace in Europe. What China lacks now is armaments, but these armaments can be supplied by Western countries. The Chinese people have a firm will to resist, not just millions, but hundreds of millions. If Western countries provide China with modern armaments, the war consumed here will inevitably exhaust Japan and eventually cause it to collapse. A weakened or defeated Japan will not become a worrying war element for the Soviet Union's eastern defense line, and the Soviet Union will not have to worry about both east and west. With no need to worry about both east and west, plus the United States' endless fighting power to assist Britain and France, it can make Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy understand that war is still a delusion that cannot achieve its goals.</p>
<p>(10) Westernism</p>
<p>But opponents believe that the real problems in Europe do not allow Britain and France to take action in China or the Far East. This view is a recurrence of a strategic concept from the European War. This concept prolonged the period of the last World War, and if it were not for American intervention, Germany under the rule of the House of Hohenzollern would not have failed."</p>
<p>During the last World War, the French called this concept "Westernism." I believe that if it is not an absolute defense theory, this theory firmly advocates focusing on the Western front. At that time, most of the Allied military experts and realistic politicians advocated this strategy and opposed the theory of focusing on the Eastern front. According to the theory of those who advocated focusing on the Eastern front, since the enemy's main force was in the West, it was certain that the Western battle had to be won, but from the perspective of common sense and sound strategy, one should take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses and attack their East to achieve victory in the early stages of the war. This theory was later faithfully proven to be correct. The reason why General Foch was able to overcome the enemy on the Western front was undoubtedly due to the collapse of Turkish and Bulgarian military forces, which greatly affected and led to the failure of the German military forces in the East.</p>
<p>(11) Four-Power Intervention</p>
<p>If Britain and France were to intervene in the line of defense in China against the aggressor nations, they could not only protect the interests of their empires but also quickly fulfill their treaty obligations to China. The strength of the aggressor nations on the Chinese line of defense is actually less than their strength on the European line of defense. Therefore, if Russia participates in joint intervention, the safety of Britain and France in Europe will not be in any danger during any intervention period. Moreover, if the actions of Britain, the United States, France, and Russia take the form of Western intervention, it is also very possible. The so-called four-power intervention is to make tiered demands on Japan, demanding that it stop the slaughter in China and demanding that it participate in the Washington International Conference to resolve the Far East issues.</p>
<p>Japan may refuse these demands, but it is not certain. Japanese leaders have historically yielded to strength three times. The first time, American naval commander Matthew Perry forced feudal Japan to open the country and trade with various countries. The second time, before the European War, Japan was intervened in by Russia, Germany, and France and yielded, returning the Liaodong Peninsula to China. The third time, at the Washington Conference after the European War, Japan was forced by pressure from all sides to give up Shandong. Now the safety of all countries depends on the maintenance of the existing international system and the balance of power in the world. Therefore, if Chinese politicians can assist the great powers in creating a common action of the four powers, it is very possible that Japan will yield to strength for the fourth time.</p>
<h3>Four-Nation Anti-Communist Pact to Transform into Military Alliance: Japan Dispatches Three Commissioners to Berlin Conference to Clarify Opinions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Canning, in an article in the "News Chronicle," stated that the Japan-Germany-Italy-Hungary Anti-Comintern Pact is planning to transform into a military alliance. Japan has already dispatched three commissioners on the "Conte Verde" (which passed through Hong Kong last week) to Germany to clarify official instructions at the Berlin conference at the end of this month. The purpose is to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. All Japanese ambassadors to Europe will also attend at that time. It is said that the reason for the delay in transforming the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance is that Japan wants to target the Soviet Union, while Germany and Italy strongly advocate that Britain, France, and the United States should also be included as targets. The newspaper also stated that at a meeting of Japanese ambassadors to Europe in Paris last month, it was decided to ask the Japanese government to accept the opinions of Germany and Italy, hence the upcoming Berlin conference.</p>
<h3>MacDonald Reviews Jewish Proposal; Arabs Issue Declaration Demanding Complete Independence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Today, Jewish representatives and British representatives attended the Palestine Conference. Colonial Secretary MacDonald reviewed the proposals of the Jewish Congress. It is understood that the Jewish delegation has agreed to provide a considered response to several points raised on Sunday. The Arabs issued a declaration stating that the Arab proposal aims to enable Arabs to enjoy their natural rights in a peaceful country, and to safeguard national independence and guarantee freedom and security, in accordance with traditional ideals. The Arab proposal does not express resentment towards the people of Britain or other countries. "The Arabs have been deprived of the independence promised by the British government in October 1915. The Arabs will never recognize the Balfour Declaration or the Mandate. The issue of Jewish refugees' settlement concerns the entire civilized world. The solution to this problem must be sought elsewhere, not in Palestine. The Arabs demand (1) complete independence; (2) abandonment of the attempt to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine; (3) abolition of the Mandate and its replacement with a treaty, making Palestine an independent Arab state; (4) an immediate halt to Jewish immigration to Palestine; (5) a ban on land sales to Jews." It is claimed that the current policy in Palestine is extremely unfair to the Arab people. Palestine cannot achieve peace until the principles of morality and equality are accepted to achieve true fairness.</p>
<h3>Grand Launch Ceremony Held for German Battleship; Hitler to Deliver Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] Germany's largest battleship since the war is scheduled to be launched on February 14th. A grand ceremony will be held at that time, and government officials will attend the Bols shipyard. It is believed that Hitler will also attend and deliver a speech. The name of the ship is currently kept strictly secret, and is currently represented by the letter "F." The ship is estimated at 35,000 tons and is the fastest and best-equipped warship in Germany. Two other ships were designed at the same time as this ship and are expected to be completed around the summer.</p>

<h3>Spaak's Resignation; Not Yet Accepted by Belgian King</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Beijing, 11th] Belgian King Leopold met with former Prime Minister Spaak yesterday afternoon for more than an hour. Prior to that, he had met with the presidents of the parliament and senate, as well as several other key government officials. According to political sources, the Belgian King greatly desires that Spaak's cabinet continue to exist, as the cabinet's resignation has not yet been formally accepted. Furthermore, according to a statement issued by Parliament President Hesman after leaving the palace, the Belgian King refused to accept the proposal for a coalition cabinet of Catholics and Socialists, and refused to dissolve parliament. Furthermore, local newspapers commented that due to racial and cultural conflicts between Walloons and Flemish, it may be difficult to completely resolve the current political situation.</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Government Plans to Join Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] Colonel Luis, commander of the Nationalist forces on the Spanish island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean, was discussing the peaceful acceptance of Menorca with representatives of the Menorca government on the British cruiser HMS "Devonshire" (which was anchored in Mahon harbor on Menorca) yesterday when several aircraft suddenly flew from Mallorca and bombed Menorca. Members of the British Parliament have commented that, due to the resentment of the Nationalist authorities over the expressions issued by the Republican side to General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, the Duke of Alba, the unofficial representative of the Nationalist government in the UK, has been instructed to provide assurances to the British government that the Nationalist government may join the Anti-Comintern Pact, which is a matter of considerable concern. Britain is said to have discussed this with the Nationalist authorities.</p>
<h3>What If Franco Wins?!</h3>
<p>— Translated by Shichang</p>
<p>Abridged translation of Paul Mc Gufre's original article from the February issue of Parade magazine this year.</p>
<p>The Spanish war has progressed to its final stages. People who are concerned about the Spanish war have clearly shifted their attention from the military aspect to a more important aspect—establishing a new Spain. Even those who strongly support Franco express anxiety about this issue: what kind of political system will the new Spain adopt? Will it adopt a fascist political system like Italy, or a Nazi political system like Germany? Will it be ruled by Italians or Germans? This is an important question after the Spanish war. Many people will raise this question. When I went to Spain, I also thought about these questions. According to what I can deduce, the answer is as follows:</p>
<p>I do not believe that Germany and Italy can rule Spain in the short term. Italy's purpose in participating in the Spanish war was to stop the development of communism in Spain. Of course, the defeat of the Spanish government forces gave Italy's policy an important victory. Germany's participation in the Spanish war helped Franco gain great benefits in terms of commodity production and transportation in Spain, but we still cannot see that Italy or Germany can rule Spain. They may be able to obtain certain privileges, such as developing mining, etc., but the power of other foreign capital in Spain is very significant and influential (such as Britain's power in Rio Tinto and Vizcaya). Whether Spain welcomes the expansion of foreign investment is also very questionable, and Franco, at the beginning of the war, even when he was most hopeless, firmly declared that he would protect the integrity of Spanish territory and not allow any other country to occupy an inch of Spanish land. The Spanish people are trying their best to support this statement. I believe that Spanish nationalism will definitely flourish. This phenomenon may have advantages and disadvantages. The new Spain is not the Spain we have been familiar with in recent centuries. This new Spain has a very active military and cultural evolution.</p>
<p>The strangest phenomenon I got from Spain is that people all over Spain, especially general political affairs personnel, pay very close attention to the issue of rebuilding Spain, and are more concerned about it than the war that is still going on. Spaniards have a special talent for handling their own affairs. War is a matter for soldiers, and the difficult work of political officials is to establish a new order. There is a close relationship between the strategy of soldiers and the governance of political officials.</p>
<p>When we think of the new Spain in the future and its political system, we must remember that the Spanish people are very eager for personal freedom. A political system that despises freedom can never appear in Spain, so Spain must absolutely not be fascistized or Nazified. In the process of restoring Spain, various failures are inevitable, but the spirit of those engaged in this restoration work is firm and pure. Therefore, it can be asserted that the new order in Spain will adopt a political system like Portugal, rather than like Italy or Germany. The Spanish people know that this new order must develop from the lower classes to the upper classes. Society is gradually progressing, and it cannot be manufactured all at once. Although the government must guide or supervise certain situations, it must encourage people to automatically develop their economic organizations. Spain's political institutions will gradually grow up like Portugal.</p>
<p>Franco is very clearly aware that he cannot create a political system and force the Spanish people to accept it. He must gradually cultivate the development of a certain political system, so that the people automatically tend to a kind of political system, such as paying attention to his family morality and social importance, and working hard to establish various situations, so that every family knows this importance. The new Spain will value the interests of civilians and promote the average distribution of property. Portugal is now rapidly moving towards becoming a country with an average distribution of wealth, and Spain will also move in this direction. Spain must continue to implement the wage system, and has accepted the principle of the family wage system. Efforts will also be made to improve undertakings with low wages, especially regarding home industries and clothing undertakings that employ female workers. Spain has now stipulated the minimum wage for home industries, and has also improved working conditions. The wages of car drivers have increased by 50%, and public health undertakings are also progressing rapidly. There are tuberculosis sanatoriums in all provinces of Spain, which are sufficient to accommodate tuberculosis patients across the country. In addition, there are children's hospitals to promote children's health.</p>
<p>Is the new Spain growing?</p>
<h3>Brief Comment: Japanese Envoy to Europe</h3>
<p>[London, 11th Dispatch from the News Chronicle] "Three Japanese envoys have gone to Europe, and their task is to convey Japan's views on the meeting to be convened in Berlin at the end of this month." The "Berlin meeting" referred to here is a meeting where the three aggressive countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan will discuss how to make further developments in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. From the Munich Conference to the fall of Catalonia, the European situation has undergone new changes. How will fascist aggressors enhance mutual contact in the future? How will they carry out the re-division of colonies under a unified strategy? And how to change the tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact into a tripartite military alliance? All these will be important topics of this meeting.</p>
<p>The foreign policy of × and ×× compromise has not only sacrificed Abyssinia, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, and is not only sacrificing Spain and some intermediate countries in Europe, but will also lead to adventurous actions by fascist aggressors directly demanding colonies from countries such as Britain and France. German and Italian aggressors are indeed attempting to use this Berlin meeting to achieve a dominant position in Europe, and Japan is even conspiring to intensify its collusion with German and Italian aggressors? Safely implement its "Japan-Manchukuo-China Group" and "East Asia New Order". Germany's Three B policy is being repeated in the old way, and is being promoted step by step. Italy's plan to dominate the Mediterranean and Africa has also begun its most intensive actions? And Japanese aggressors have even taken the military step of forcibly occupying Hainan Island due to the serious situation!</p>
<p>The situation of war on two fronts is becoming increasingly clear. All those who do not want to be slaves of fascist aggressors, all those who love peace and protect freedom and justice, should quickly stand on the side of the peace front and quickly use their strength to break the international ×× bandits ×' meeting and its plans!</p>
<h3>Japanese × Attack Hainan Island</h3>
<p>The serious significance of the Japanese × attack on Hainan Island, especially the serious significance of the Japanese × beginning direct military action to threaten the Far East ××× countries, has been pointed out in detail in yesterday's editorial of this newspaper. According to dispatches from various parties, the authorities of France, Britain, and the United States have paid close attention to it and are discussing taking clear actions to deal with it. Although it is not yet possible to predict how the situation will develop, the following points should be noted by us:</p>
<p>First, the Japanese × attack on Hainan Island has two main intentions: internally, it is to cooperate with the anti-Soviet provocation incidents on the border of the puppet Manchukuo, creating a serious situation, in order to curb the mutiny of the Japanese army in the front and the anti-war sentiment of all sectors in the rear, in order to facilitate the parliament to pass the huge military budget of 730 million yen for the next year; externally, it is to cooperate with the adventures of German and Italian aggressors in Europe and launch a preliminary battle to exclude the powers in the Far East.</p>
<p>Second, the Japanese × action of attacking Hainan Island has inherent factors for inevitable failure due to its own lack of strength. Therefore, this action not only cannot be said that the × army's momentum is still great, but on the contrary, it exposes the × army's ×××× speculative adventure. This kind of Japanese action can be resisted and can be stopped.</p>
<p>Third, the important impact that the Japanese × action of attacking Hainan Island can have on the future of our country's war of resistance is to expand the battlefield, disperse the × army's strength, and increase our foreign aid and the × army's external pressure. Not only will our southwest war resistance situation not deteriorate, but it will develop more smoothly.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should not relax every opportunity to increase the × people's difficulties and develop the victory of our army based on these characteristics listed above. Our opinion circles should explain these characteristics to the people of the country on the one hand, break the peace and surrender propositions of × people, traitors, and pro-Japanese elements who are defeatists, and on the other hand, awaken the peace and democratic countries, pay attention to the serious threat of the Japanese × attack on Hainan Island to the Far East interests of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, quickly jointly and effectively promote the steps of aiding China and curbing Japan, and smash any absurd propositions of international conferences to mediate the "Sino-Japanese conflict". This is one point. Secondly, we should take emergency steps in military terms. On the one hand, we should massively supply the heroic resistance troops and guerrillas on the island with military fire, grain, and other supplies in order to persistently contain a large number of × troops in a corner of Hainan; on the other hand, we should step up the counter-offensive actions of our army in Guangdong Province, especially breaking the attack pride on the Yuehan Road and Xijiang. This is two.</p>

<h3>After × Lands on Hainan, Hong Kong's Economy and Food Are Affected; Huge Commercial Exchanges Between the Two Places Will Suffer Losses; Meat Supply Interrupted, Risk of Market Shortages in the Future</h3>
<p>In order to implement its southward policy, × does not hesitate to violate the Franco-Japanese agreement and attack Hainan Island. When the telegrams came, people here attached great importance to it. The economic relationship between Hainan and Hong Kong is extremely close, and the number of commercial exchanges is quite large. Among them, the largest are livestock such as pigs and cattle, sugar, vegetables, and fresh fruits. Nineteen out of ten pigs and cattle in Hong Kong's daily meat supply come from Hainan. Now that the war has broken out, the source will inevitably be interrupted, and it will not be difficult for Hong Kong's meat supply to be in short supply. In the past, livestock such as pigs and cattle were transported from Taiwan, our Guangdong inland, and Wuzhou in Guangxi. Since the war began last year, merchants have automatically refused to source from Taiwan, and now transportation to the mainland Wuzhou is also congested. With the source from Hainan cut off, the future supply will be a serious problem. As for a large number of local Hainan products, which are transported and sold by various offices, they will also be lost after this. Moreover, a not small number of European and American goods are transported from Hong Kong to Hainan for sale every year. Therefore, this time the × army attacked Qiong, which invisibly caused major blows to Hong Kong's commerce and food. It is inevitable that European and American merchants in Hong Kong who have invested in Hainan in the past will suffer losses. It goes without saying that Hong Kong's commerce and food have suffered major blows from this action by the × army.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Qiong Ships Still Set Sail Yesterday</p>
<p>Moreover, it is even more important in the shipping industry. It is found that the Qiongzhou Strait is a necessary stop on the shipping routes from South China to various ports in Southeast Asia, and it is the main route of Taikoo Jardine and other shipping companies, which is no different from the lifeblood of their business. If the scope of the war expands, it will not be difficult for × to blockade the strait, and various Yihs will inevitably be forced to suspend navigation. Yesterday, Taikoo company officials claimed that the company's ships had no intention of suspending navigation, unless it was until the Japanese side prevented navigation before a decision was made. Jardine Matheson and other companies also adopted the same attitude. Yisheng of Yi Si and Jiangsu of Taikoo both set sail from Hong Kong to Haikou yesterday afternoon, and Meinan is scheduled to set sail this morning. However, each ship temporarily suspended the delivery of goods, and various banks, trading houses, and merchants did not dare to deliver goods due to the unclear situation. There were also few passengers. It was also found that Yongsheng, Xinjiang, Meizhongmei and other ships arrived in Hong Kong from Haikou at 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. yesterday, respectively. All ships left Haikou for Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 9th. At that time, everything was as usual. However, when the ship Meizhongmei set sail, it encountered a Japanese warship outside the port. After the ship's crew answered each question in flag language to the crew members of the warship, it was allowed to leave.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Based Qiong Overseas Chinese Initiate to Save Hometown</p>
<p>Also, since the news of the landing of × troops in Qiong spread to Hong Kong, the Qiongya fellow villagers living in Hong Kong have paid abnormal attention. At the same time, because the telegram exchanges are intermittent, the situation is very unclear, and everyone is anxious. Moreover, the outbreak of the war, the hometown is in trouble, and it is inevitable that they will be displaced, hungry, and cold. Relief and rescue are urgent. Therefore, yesterday, the Qiongya Fellow Villagers Association in Hong Kong held an urgent special meeting to decide on the various relief work to be carried out in the hometown. Now, they are determined to actively mobilize and appeal to various overseas Chinese groups and charitable organizations to assist in everything, so that all future relief work in the hometown can be carried out effectively.</p>
<h3>Imperial Airways General Manager in Hong Kong Returns to Hong Kong to Discuss Planning Hong Kong-Yunnan-Burma Line Stations; Mission Completed Yesterday, Returned to Hong Kong by Plane from Hanoi; Denies Going to Chongqing to Attend Opening Conference of Burma-Chongqing Flight</h3>
<p>Our authorities signed an agreement with the British some time ago to open up the Rangoon-Kunming-Hong Kong line to facilitate contact. At the same time, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is developing a new Chongqing-Burma line and dispatching giant aircraft to travel on it. Therefore, after the completion of the Hong Kong-Rangoon line, it will have close contact with the Chongqing-Burma line. Regarding the facts of the opening of the above two lines, Chongqing held a meeting on the 6th of this month. Mr. Meiri, the general manager of Imperial Airways in Hong Kong, left Hong Kong and flew to Penang before the meeting. It was rumored that Mr. Mei's trip was to attend the meeting in Chongqing. Mr. Mei returned to Hong Kong from Hanoi yesterday on a Danapo Bana Imperial Airways aircraft. The reporter asked about the course of this trip and denied going to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Meiri's Speech Denies Going to Chongqing</p>
<p>According to Mr. Meiri, he took a car from Kunming to Hanoi and then took a plane back to Hong Kong. It is not true that I went to Chongqing a few days ago to attend the joint flight meeting between China National Aviation Corporation and Imperial Airways. My destination this time was Kunming, not Chongqing. I did not know that there was such a meeting in Chongqing. I left Hong Kong for Hanoi on the 31st of last month and took the road to Yunnan. I stayed in Kunming for eight days. The task I was assigned was to plan the Kunming airport on the Hong Kong-Yunnan-Burma line in preparation for the future opening of flights. In addition, I did not participate in any group meetings. All matters regarding the opening of the Hong Kong-Yunnan-Rangoon line have long been discussed and completed by China and Britain. Now all preparations have been completed and flights will be opened in the short term. My inspection work in Yunnan has been completed and I am returning to Hong Kong specifically. I will send the information I have obtained to the head office for review on the Tuesday flight. Once I receive a reply by telegram, the airport work can begin immediately. The type of aircraft to be dispatched in the future and the date of the opening of flights will also have to wait for the approval of the head office. It has not yet been decided at present.</p>
<p>Flying Hotel Passengers Expected Soon</p>
<p>The Pan American giant Boeing aircraft on the Hong Kong-US line is scheduled to fly from San Francisco to Hong Kong on the 22nd of this month and arrive on the 1st of next month as scheduled. This flight is for test flight purposes and will not carry passengers on either of the round trips. After this test flight is completed, official flights will be opened to passengers on March 22nd. The Pan American authorities are now making some changes to the original flying scissor schedule in preparation for the opening of the aircraft. The revised time has been announced as follows:</p>
<p>The China Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong from the US on February 13 and return to the US from Hong Kong on February 14. The Philippine Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong on February 22 and return to the US on February 23. The Boeing (NX18760) will arrive in Hong Kong on March 1 and return to the US on March 2. The China Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong on March 8 and return to the US on March 9. The Philippine Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong on March 15 and return to the US on March 16. The Boeing (NX186701) will arrive in Hong Kong on March 22 and return to the US on March 23.</p>

<h3>Amateur Association Advocates: Year-End Economy and Donation Movement; Eliminate Wasteful Habits, Donate to Save the Nation; Donations to Be Submitted to This Newspaper for Remittance to the Government</h3>
<p>The "Amateur Association" is one of the organizations in Hong Kong that vigorously promotes economy. Under the banner of fellowship, it advocates a reasonable lifestyle for the people of Hong Kong. It aims to replace extravagant pleasures with collective and wholesome entertainment. It is also enthusiastic about the war effort, encouraging various donation movements. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the people of Hong Kong may be preparing for festivities. However, happiness comes with conditions! The "Amateur Association" continues the spirit of the "One Dollar Movement" and "Charity Sales," proposing a "Year-End Donation Movement." Excerpts from their proposal regarding this movement are as follows:</p>
<p>"The Lunar New Year is approaching, and our compatriots will traditionally celebrate joyfully—but…we are currently fighting desperately against the enemy. This is not a time for individual pleasure-seeking…</p>
<p>"Holding firm to our belief in victory, we are delighted that our nation has embarked on a path of self-reliance during the war of resistance, advancing forward. We want to celebrate the future of China, so we cry out loudly! This twenty-eighth Lunar New Year [1939], we should donate all the money previously spent on banquets, gambling, gift-giving, firecrackers, and worshipping idols to the government to buy airplanes, guns, cannons, and bombs to fight the enemy. This would be a meaningful and easily achievable action. We now call it 'Year-End Donation'…</p>
<p>"We have now contacted the Hong Kong 'Shen Bao' and 'Ta Kung Pao' newspapers to collect these donations on our behalf. Once a sufficient amount is accumulated, it will be remitted to the government. We hope that everyone will send their saved money to the aforementioned newspapers!…"</p>
<p>Their enthusiastic actions to save the nation will surely receive the fervent support of the overseas Chinese. Compatriots! Let us enthusiastically contribute money and respond to this movement!</p>
<h3>St. John's Ambulance Brigade Survey Results: Number of Homeless Refugees Reaches 20,000; Hong Kong Government Still Lacks Comprehensive Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Since the enemy's invasion of South China, a large number of war refugees have flooded into Hong Kong. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have been busy with relief efforts, neglecting the original refugees in Hong Kong. The only remaining relief organization is the Street Sleepers Relief Society, which continues to operate refugee camps. However, although the various camps are open as much as possible, many refugees are still sleeping on the streets, huddled together with their children, presenting a pathetic sight. A month ago, the Hong Kong government, in order to provide relief, entrusted the St. John Ambulance Brigade to conduct a detailed survey in the Hong Kong and areas to prepare for the implementation of relief measures. The survey work has also been completed. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Morris, the Superintendent-in-Chief of the Brigade, to inquire about the survey process and the progress of relief measures. He stated that the authorities believe that these refugees are forced to sleep on the streets and become displaced due to the difficulties in their lives and the lack of sufficient income to cover their food and housing needs. The authorities have a responsibility to provide such relief. A month ago, the responsibility for the survey was entrusted to the Brigade, with each division dispatched to conduct surveys in various districts at night. The survey was completed last month, and a survey report was prepared and submitted to the Hong Kong government for reference. However, according to a report published a few days ago, the total number of refugees in Hong Kong is 50,000, which may not be entirely accurate. According to reports received from various divisions, the total number is approximately 20,000. As for what measures the authorities will take to provide relief, there is still no overall plan. However, it is expected that these refugees will be moved to the refugee camp in North Point (Seven Sisters). The relocation will be carried out step by step, without coercion. Those who are willing to enter the camp will be sent there by the government.</p>
<p>Interview</p>
<h3>Progress of the Era Drama Troupe</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Organization, Art, and Spirit Have All Improved</p>
<p>After several months of separation, the "Era Drama Troupe" once again held its seventh expanded public performance at the Po Hing Theatre yesterday. Attending this performance felt like meeting old friends, filling me with warmth. Although I am not very familiar with the "Era Drama Troupe" of the past, I have witnessed its growth firsthand. I have seen how this "Flower of the Era" sprouted from a seed, how it budded, and how it bloomed. Furthermore, I have expressed earnest wishes for it to bear beautiful fruit. This is the "Era Drama Troupe's" seventh public performance. With the exception of the sixth performance in Macau, I have attended the previous five performances. Each performance showed improvement. This premiere performance of "Wilderness" in Hong Kong especially revealed the bright future of the "Era Drama Troupe's" rebirth.</p>
<p>To learn more details about the "Era Drama Troupe," I visited Li Chenfeng backstage at the Po Hing Theatre on the night of the "Wilderness" performance. The first act was already underway. In the backstage area, apart from the sound of actors reciting their lines from the front of the stage, everyone working backstage was moving quickly and silently. Upon seeing Mr. Li Chenfeng, I almost didn't recognize him in his gauze clothing and with an earring. He was playing the role of Jiao Daxing in "Wilderness." Afraid of disturbing the front of the stage, I whispered to him, and he could only briefly share the troupe's future plans. He said:</p>
<p>"Many friends who love theater art know the struggles of the Era Drama Troupe in the past, because running a professional troupe in Hong Kong is simply an adventurous undertaking. In the past, we held regular performances at the Central Theatre, but each time we suffered losses. Coping with these setbacks was the most difficult task. Many troupe members endured hardships. The only consolation was the praise and encouragement from the public, which boosted our morale. Despite the difficulties, we never dared to lose heart. This rebirth of the Era Drama Troupe can be said to have reached a second stage, bringing us closer to our goal.</p>
<p>"The Era Drama Troupe has greatly expanded its organization for this performance. Many new members have joined, most of whom are well-known in mainland China and came to Hong Kong after the war. There are also three students from the Drama Research Institute who are well-versed in theater art. Therefore, the current lineup of the Era Drama Troupe is stronger than before. We are also very grateful for Mr. Wu Chu-fan's guest appearance. One thing worth noting is that Mr. Ouyang Yuqian spent several months guiding us in rehearsing plays such as 'The New Official Takes Office,' which greatly enhanced our artistic skills.</p>
<p>"The Era Drama Troupe's plans for the future differ somewhat from the past. In terms of performances, we have decided to hold regular performances in Hong Kong and Macau, aiming for six or seven performances each month: two days in Hong Kong and two days in Kowloon. Previously, each performance was only staged once, and the timing was in the morning, which was not convenient for the general public. Now, we have changed to performing both matinee and evening shows, giving everyone the opportunity to attend. However, finding a performance venue at the end of the year is not easy, so whether our planned schedule will be realized is still uncertain, but we hope that we can achieve our goal. Performing in Macau is no longer a problem; the most difficult task is still finding a suitable theater in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"The selection of plays is also the most important issue. Apart from plays that require special sets or too many characters, which are beyond our capabilities, we plan to perform two main types of plays: one that benefits China's resistance against the enemy, and one that is closer to our daily lives. At the same time, we will also pay attention to rehearsing new plays that have never been performed in Hong Kong. The 'Wilderness' that we are performing this time is a premiere in Hong Kong. The Cantonese performances of 'Sunrise' and 'The New Official Takes Office' can also be considered pioneering. The rehearsal time was too short, so perhaps there are imperfections, but we are determined to encourage ourselves and work harder to establish a solid foundation for the development of spoken drama in Hong Kong."</p>
<p>At this point, it was time for "Jiao Daxing" to go on stage. Li Chenfeng could not continue talking. He asked me to visit the troupe another day to chat and hurried onto the stage. After the interview, I took my seat to watch the "Wilderness."</p>
<p>Cao Yu's "Wilderness" is as brilliant as "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise." Although the story focuses on "Chou Hu's" revenge, the depiction of different human natures is also quite powerful. The main part is in the third act, and the best performance is also in the third act.</p>
<p>Old members such as Lu Dun, Ou Ai, Li Chenfeng, and Wu Si have all improved, especially Li Chenfeng and Lu Dun, who can be said to have achieved complete success. Li Yueqing, who played "Jiao Da's Mother," had very skilled acting and lines, which was refreshing and delightful. The climax of the play was when Chou Hu shouted, "Dark world—we are simply in hell!" This is the most brilliant line.</p>

<h3>The Market for Children's Toys</h3>
<p>— Jun Ren</p>
<p>Domestic Toys Rise in Popularity</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, I would be delighted and excited every time the Lunar New Year approached. There was good food, red envelopes, and especially toys given by my parents and relatives. Before the New Year, I would already stare blankly at the New Year's stalls on the streets and alleys. They were filled with toys, red and green, bizarre and colorful, whistling, blowing, and jumping—everything imaginable. You can imagine how tempting and attractive this was to children. After all, parents see through this psychology of children, so at this time they have to make an exception and buy some to win their children's hearts.</p>
<p>These children's toys seem not worth caring about. Many people believe that toys are not serious or valuable things, so they are unimportant. In fact, if we examine them carefully, they are a very important matter, because toys have a great influence on children's education. Good toys are equivalent to good children's education. Therefore, in foreign countries, experts study children's toys and make great efforts to improve them. In contrast, the Chinese have exactly the opposite attitude. They mostly ignore the relationship between toys and education, and they believe that toys are just small items, and the amount of money required for everyone to buy them is small. However, they do not know that small amounts add up to large amounts. The amount of money China spends on toys each year is surprisingly large. It can be seen that although toys are small items, they are directly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Because the Chinese do not pay attention to toys, the narrow-minded Japanese have also coveted this path. They make small things into toys and sell them to China in large quantities. As a result, these small toys have become one of their major exports. Not only in China, but also in the markets of various countries around the world are filled with products. In the past, we saw Japanese tin toys sold in the markets at the end of the year and the beginning of the year. The stalls were full of them, and they even penetrated into rural areas. Almost all of China was filled with these oriental toys. In just one New Year, some of the toys consumed in the hands of children had already exchanged a lot of gold earned by the sweat of the Chinese people. Thinking of this makes people shudder.</p>
<p>One New Year after another has passed, and at the same time, funds have been flowing out of the country. Later, partly because the Chinese people had some awareness, and partly because of , they gradually began to pay attention to the manufacture of toys. Domestic toys have indeed made great progress in recent years. Up to now, although it cannot completely recover this loss, it has also been of great benefit.</p>
<p>However, because China's industry is underdeveloped, the manufacture of toys is still mostly handicraft production. Wooden ones, such as swords and spears, are painted with silver paint and decorated with red cloth. This is the most common toy, so even now, people still have a mentality. This is probably because of the influence of this type of toy. There are also figures carved from Yangmei wood, such as woodcutters, fishermen, and weavers. The workmanship is very fine, and the carving is beautiful. Not only can they be used as toys, but they can also be called works of art. Foreigners like these wood carvings very much, and many of them are bought. At the Jinmen World Expo, hundreds of kinds of wood carvings were transported for exhibition. The best at carving these figures are mostly from Fuzhou, but unfortunately, many of them produce various bad things, such as gambling and smoking, which have a negative impact on international audiences. There are also many paper toys, mainly windmills, masks, paper mice, and paper snakes. In addition to clay figures, clay ones include birds, fruits, and exquisite lucky items, but the fruit handles and chicken feet are made of iron wire, which is not convenient for children to play with. The work of ceramic and porcelain ones is very exquisite, but unfortunately they are easily broken, so sales are not widespread. Various animals made of sealing wax can float on water, but they are rarely seen now. These are all the inherent toys of China in the past. Few of them are currently popular. There are only some wooden and bamboo ones, such as bamboo machine guns and wooden geese and ducks, which are the only ones left.</p>
<p>Initially, none of the roads and toys were goods, but China only set up factories to produce them itself last year. The results are not bad, and the workmanship of the Great Ocean dolls is far superior to the goods. Unfortunately, there are too few products. Initially, the iron-printed toys were also completely goods. Currently, the domestically produced iron-printed toys are quite developed, and all the characters are modeled after Chinese people, so they are very popular and have replaced some goods. A new type of toy is a small tin army, which is made by model casting. There are various soldiers in various poses, artillery, broadsword teams, and tanks, all of which are available. One group is the Chinese army, and the other group is the army. When lined up, they look like they are fighting against each other. Because we are currently in the period of resistance against the enemy, this is considered the most timely toy, and sales are very good. There are even more orders from overseas Chinese, so on average, tens of thousands of dollars are transported from Hong Kong to other places every month. Imagine how amazing the number is! There are several companies in Hong Kong that manufacture these toys, and they can all make a profit. But unfortunately, some of the models are purchased from foreign countries, so the uniforms of the troops are not very similar to those of Chinese soldiers. These two points must be improved.</p>
<p>I once asked a toy vendor about the market for toys this year. According to him, this year, because the American film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" caused a sensation, all eight protagonists in the film were made into toys. Merchants are always good at seizing opportunities, so in addition to making plastic and road characters, they also use these characters as trademark patterns, such as on face powder, handkerchiefs, ties, bed sheets, New Year cards, and cigarettes. At the same time, this type of toy is also very popular. Snow White and the seven dwarfs are all lively and lovely, just like in the movie, and they are very popular with children. The toy market this year is particularly good, probably because of the increase in the population of Hong Kong. However, one phenomenon is very optimistic, that is, there are far fewer goods than in the past. During the New Year, every child is happiest when they have toys in their hands. If this toy can increase the country's resources and develop the country's industry, I believe they will be even happier.</p>

<h3>The Silver Conspiracy</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>Japanese fascists are invading China. In addition to military, political, and economic aggression, they are also spending huge amounts of money to carry out cultural aggression. The conspiracy against the film and theater industry was only brought to the attention of the Lei film and theater industry after the "Camellia" incident of the Shanghai Guangming Company's voyage to Japan not long ago. Since then, the conspiracies of Japanese fascists and their agents in China against the film and theater industry have been constantly exposed.</p>
<p>In terms of film alone, as the War of Resistance shifted from the first stage to the second, Japanese aggressors were eager to maintain and strengthen their control over the occupied areas, and their conspiracies became even more heated and intense. The purpose and content of their film conspiracy is to use film works to: on the one hand, numb the national self-esteem and self-confidence of our people in the occupied areas with pornography; on the other hand, guide our people's anti-Japanese and revengeful emotions in the occupied areas to the path of defeatism and fatalism; on the other hand, promote hypocritical and vicious appeasement policies, so that the people in the occupied areas not only willingly submit to Japanese rule, but also facilitate the exploitation of their blood and sweat by the puppet rulers to continue their invasion and achieve the conquest of China and the hegemony of the Far East.</p>
<p>Based on this conspiracy, Japanese fascists have determined the film's mainland policy. The specific guidelines and methods of this policy are, of course, absolutely secret, but according to a part of the plan that has been exposed, it can be divided into two points: first, to implement the "promotion" of Sino-Japanese culture on the screen, with the cultural departments of the Japanese military controlling the film industry in the Japanese-occupied areas and helping the political departments of the Japanese army to carry out the work of conquest; second, to use and produce Chinese film works that promote pornography, ghosts and gods, and the beautification of peace, and transport them to Japan and its colonies to promote the achievements of the "Imperial Army" and cover up its atrocities in China. (The above two points are based on the conclusions of the "Symposium on Japanese Mainland Policy and Its Trends" held by the Propaganda Department of the Japanese Special Service Agency on Changan Street, Beiping, on June 10 last year, the conclusion of Wen Fangsu, Director of the Cultural Bureau of the Puppet Provisional Government, that "Sino-Japanese friendship should start with film," and the proposals of Ichiide Aya, President of the Japanese International Eisho News, all of which are found in Japanese "International Eisho News" Nos. 1216 and Japanese Eisho Mainland Development Issue) The cultural traitor Zhang Liansheng (Donghe Film Company) advocated that "Japanese film activities in China must not add the names of Japan or Manchuria to the films. It is best to appear entirely in the guise of Chinese films, with no relationship to Japan or Manchuria on the surface, and to make it appear to be entirely a Chinese business." He also advocated that "no matter what, love must be the center, and this kind of inherited love must be quite rich. Whether it is acting or actors, there must be a considerable dramatic flavor, and it must be performed in a very vulgar way." This proposal was naturally adopted.</p>
<p>The conspiracy of the silver offensive has thus unfolded, and the minions who carry out this conspiracy are active at home and abroad, as well as in those special cities close to the motherland. According to a report in a Hong Kong newspaper on February 7, there are some speculative film merchants in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and the Americas who, under the pretext of maintaining business, transport films to North China for screening at a price of about 4,000 yuan. This is, of course, just one example of the expansion of the silver conspiracy. There are many more facts that have not been revealed or made public! Here, we only dare to tell the relevant authorities, film merchants, and film and theater workers: First, Japanese fascists are carrying out cultural aggression against us, and even in terms of silver aggression alone, they have a fairly broad and complete plan, and they are spending a considerable amount of money. Just look at the Tokyo telegram from the Associated Press on February 7, saying that the Japanese government announced that it would soon send an entertainment ship to Guangdong, carrying 150 wireless radios, 600 phonographs, 12,000 Chinese propaganda films, 18,000 chess sets, and countless Japanese films. This shows one aspect of it. What we hold to win the final victory in the War of Resistance is the centralized leadership of the nation's vital forces. Although we are not afraid of any Japanese appeasement propaganda conspiracy, we should be vigilant in view of the active actions of the enemy and the inadequacy of our mobilization work. The highest leader has already determined the principle that political work is more important than military affairs and propaganda is more important than organization in the second phase of the War of Resistance. We should, under this principle, intensify the general mobilization of the cultural sector, especially the film and theater industry, which is closest to the masses, on the one hand, to eliminate the smoke and conspiracies of traitors, and on the other hand, to increase the power to centralize and lead the nation's vital forces. Secondly, we should widely and deeply carry out the movement to eliminate the old and create the new in film and theater, on the one hand, to eliminate the corrupt and evil elements in film and theater, and on the other hand, to strengthen the progressive elements, promote the backward elements, and establish a solid anti-Japanese united front, so that the national film and theater can serve China's War of Resistance and the world's anti-fascist aggression. In addition, since the fall of Shanghai, Chinese film practitioners have suffered a major blow. Since the fall of Guangzhou, film practitioners in South China have lost the markets of Shiqi, Jiangmen, and Taishan. Therefore, a small number of blind and unscrupulous elements are carrying out speculation and are willingly used by traitors. We should also make proper arrangements to prevent all dangerous tendencies and open up a righteous path. We believe that sensitive film practitioners will never willingly degenerate and be used by traitors. This relies heavily on the close cooperation of film and theater practitioners, cultural workers, and the media. May each work hard!</p>
<p>The "Era" Performs Cao Yu's Famous Play</p>

<h3>Startle the Eyes, Raise Your Head, and Start Walking! The Past and Future of the Era Theater Troupe</h3>
<p>— Qiu Luo</p>
<p>The "Era Theater Troupe" appeared in Hong Kong, where dramatic theory and practice were exceptionally weak, with a youthful and enterprising attitude. "Era" had no money, no backstage backers, relying only on the mouths of its members and the troupe leaders, and a spirit of hard work and perseverance. In half a year of arduous struggle, they surprisingly opened up a new chapter for drama in Hong Kong. The arrival of the China Traveling Theater Troupe certainly gave Hong Kong drama a new stimulus, but the one who planted the seeds was still "Era," and "Era" also yielded good fruit. Now, there are twenty or thirty drama groups in Hong Kong, expanding and developing.</p>
<p>The "Era Theater Troupe" is actually the successor of the drama group of the early Chinese Arts Association and the South China Drama Research Society. The number of people is the same; it's just a change of name but not substance. Years ago, "South China" performed plays such as "Lugou Bridge" and "Thunderstorm" at the Ko Shing Theatre. Although it was a business failure, it was at that time that drama began to gain the attention of businessmen. In the history of the drama movement in South China, they were no strangers to the audience.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the South China Drama Research Society planned to go to the South Sea Islands, attempting to fulfill a bit of propaganda responsibility for the country in an environment where they could make a living. "South China" sent director Li Zhiqing to negotiate with businessmen, but unfortunately, it failed. The reason for the failure was mostly that businessmen believed that drama would lose money, and they would rather use the capital for drama to make movies. Lu Dun Jun once told reporters, with the general meaning that drama would not and should not fail. It's just that drama does not have a fixed business model and is fundamentally different from movies. For example, a movie in the three regions of Nanyang, Annam, and Siam could sell for four thousand yuan, while drama does not have such a fixed price. Therefore, conservative businessmen do not treat drama and movies the same way, and the way out for drama is forgotten in the subjective and erroneous estimation of the businessmen's secret calculations. I agree with Lu Dun Jun's insightful view that if drama can gradually capture the audience, then, with good business, profit-seeking businessmen will be willing to consider it unconditionally.</p>
<p>After the failure of "South China's" trip to Nanyang, they filmed a movie, still using members of South China as the backbone. That movie was "Generational Feuds," directed by Li Zhiqing. After the movie was finished, "South China" also came to an end.</p>
<p>For a period, everyone waited quietly for an opportunity. Soon, the "Era Theater Troupe" began to organize and establish itself. "Era" first performed at the Central Theatre, successively staging "The Eve," "Roar of the Ancient City," "Night Luminous Cup," and "Paint Not Dry" from 9 am to 1 pm every day. Both business and performance were rapidly progressing upward, and businessmen held meetings to discuss the drama business. This was clearly a great improvement compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Era's performances led to the continuous organization and emergence of numerous drama groups. The domestic drama atmosphere also surged rapidly to the island, with "China Traveling Theater Troupe" being the most prominent. The "China Traveling Theater Troupe" continuously staged many famous plays at the Taiping and Puqing Theatres, giving businessmen a new understanding. At the same time, under the influence of friendly forces, the Era Theater Troupe recently obtained the right to perform at night.</p>
<p>Their first phase of work—regular performances—coincided with the arrival of the renowned playwright Ouyang Yuqian, who agreed to be the director of the troupe, just as the fifth performance ended. After this planning period, promoting the Hong Kong drama movement became even more active.</p>
<p>Since December of last year, under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, they have been busy rehearsing. The sixth performance was in Macau. Now, starting from the 10th of this month, they will perform for four consecutive days at the Puqing Theatre in Kowloon, as the seventh grand performance of the second phase. The repertoire includes the famous trilogy by the national first-class playwright Cao Yu—"Wilderness," "Sunrise," "Thunderstorm"—and the recent national defense satirical comedy "The New Official Takes Office" by the famous playwright Chen Baichen. These plays are all outstanding works, coupled with their well-trained skills and Mr. Ouyang's leadership, success can be expected.</p>
<p>Currently, both business and performance are quite optimistic. Originally, those engaged in drama do not need to be concerned about business issues. However, theatre owners believe that without business, they will not allow performances. This is an ironclad fact. We who are engaged in drama should target this environment and first make the original performance a success, so as to gain the support of a broad audience. With the support of a broad audience, businessmen will be happy to cooperate. What else is in the minds of businessmen besides money? Therefore, we do not advocate high-sounding theories but must recognize the correct path, work hard, and the Era Theater Troupe is sure to have a future.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that since the "Era Theater Troupe" has gone through arduous struggles and arduous management, it should continue to pursue its original aspiration and seek a way out in the future. As for the people of Era, they also have good training. As long as they keep going, they will surely achieve complete success. Finally, what I hope for from "Era" is to be neither arrogant nor complacent, to be calm and courageous, to recognize the mission of wartime art, and to start walking towards the bright road with eyes raised and heads held high.</p>
<h3>Special Recommendation: "The New Official Takes Office," Performed by Era Tonight</h3>
<p>"The New Official Takes Office" is a four-act national defense satirical comedy recently written by the famous playwright Chen Baichen, depicting the ugly state of shameless traitors in the occupied areas vying for power and profit, highlighting the cruel oppression of innocent people by the enemy. The content is substantial, profound, and humorous. It was noticed by both the Era Theater Troupe and the China Art Theater Troupe at the same time a month ago, and both began carefully rehearsing it under the direction of the great drama master Ouyang Yuqian. Last month, it was performed separately in Hong Kong and Macau, with each achieving its own merits. We have already had an article introducing this in the seventh issue of this magazine. Now, "Era" has specially scheduled a grand performance for tonight (Sunday) during its seventh expanded performance. Here, the performance in Cantonese is considered a first. With Mr. Ouyang's directorial style and their refined art, it is worthy of our special recommendation. Please remember: 8 pm tonight, at the Puqing Theatre in Kowloon.</p>

<h3>Era's Task</h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>While drama workers in the mainland are bravely and collectively participating in the battle, coordinating with military mobilization to inspire the fighting will of the people and strengthen the political education of soldiers, drama workers on the isolated island feel a little bewildered. On the one hand, in the safe rear of the rear, solidarity is not as solid as in the mainland, the work is not as intense as in the mainland, the target audience is different, and the environmental conditions are different. As a result, a united front has not been established. Where should drama workers go?</p>
<p>Mainly, drama appears as a form of entertainment, and this entertainment has not yet gained the universal support of the masses with low cultural levels. On the other hand, because of its revolutionary nature and technical immaturity, it cannot gain the understanding and appreciation of the "higher-class Chinese." It remains among the progressive intellectuals, and is a more powerful tool for self-education, a kind of artistic tool for preaching and persuading young people, or it only becomes a crude program for occasional "assistance," or an extreme reaction against the popular Cantonese opera and films. Can we, drama workers, be satisfied with this?</p>
<p>No, definitely not. Before the sacred War of Resistance began, the salvation movement was deeply rooted in the foundation laid by drama. That is to say, they used advanced stage techniques (such as stage splendor) and mature performing arts (gathering a large number of trained actors and stars) to win over the backward urban masses, arousing their sense of justice and patriotism. After the start of the War of Resistance, the efforts of businessmen's service movements were largely the result of this artistic infection. At the same time, it made professional drama troupes possible, established a regular new force in the drama movement, and made film art also have a sense of the times, and had to take a big step forward by following the content and imagery of stage plays. Now, in Shanghai, an isolated island that has been reduced to a guerrilla zone, there are still many drama workers working hard and technically, so that the establishment of drama theory and the supply of progressive scripts have not been interrupted.</p>
<p>They should at least do this.</p>
<p>No, we cannot stop at doing this. Hong Kong is not Shanghai. China in 1939 in the struggle is even more different from the population that was insulted and harmed after July 7th. The sparks of the War of Resistance have illuminated the world, and the giant waves of patriotism have stirred the hearts of every class, every region, and every man and woman. The masses demand bloody, rational, war-related, epic dramas more urgently than anything else. But what has failed is us. In terms of work enthusiasm, we lag far behind the aspirations of the masses. In terms of content and form, we cannot surpass the old products to meet the needs of the times. At this time, compared with Shanghai before, we must continue and expand our national liberation movement's mirror and engine of drama innovation more progressively and actively. We must not only professionalize it, popularize it, and win over the citizens, but also treat it as a practical tool for serving the War of Resistance, especially for the wounded soldiers, refugees, all the suffering compatriots, and all the forces, and strive to build a free and happy new China!</p>
<p>Combining the construction of professional drama troupes with service work groups, using professional efforts to seek more welfare for more people, and creating value outside of commodities with new drama, and serving national liberation. This is the first task of the era.</p>
<p>Constantly researching, constantly practicing, and politically aware, so that artistic achievements do not deviate from the progressing society and the growing nation. This is the second task of the era.</p>
<p>Becoming opponents of old dramas and low-level anesthetic films, using the rhythm of reality to break the anesthetic of traitorous nature, and giving film practitioners and phenomena a strong stimulus, so that films will not be abandoned by the times, and drama will become a research institute and a baptismal temple for film actors and phenomena. This is the third task of the era.</p>
<p>Establishing a mechanized drama guerrilla team, acting as a liaison and organizer for mainland drama units, and creating an audience for more advanced dramas. This is the fourth task of the era.</p>
<p>Through the common emotions of the world, using realistic images to lead the people of the world who love peace to recognize the war in China on the front lines of peace, and rise up to extinguish the robbers who destroy culture due to the resonance of human conscience! This is the fifth task of the era.</p>
<p>Coordinating with the work of national construction, creating art worthy of the great Chinese nation, and preparing good spiritual food for the new generation. This is the last (but not the least important) task of the era.</p>

<h3>Stock Market Conditions More Sluggish Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the Hong Kong stock market was only open for half a day in the morning. The situation was even more sluggish. However, most stock prices were tighter.

<h3>Conspiracy to Eliminate My Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Wu Ma</p>
<p>The latter is to move valuable things (please pay attention to the word "valuable") to the rear as much and as quickly as possible, such as the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Sichuan, in order to cooperate with the government to develop the silk industry in the southwest. At the same time, burn down the silkworm rooms to prevent them from being used by the Japanese. Because the government has repeatedly stated that it is very much in need of private capital and technology, and this is the time when the people of the whole country are doing their part, all kinds of production enterprises should follow the government to move west. Except for those who are directly engaged in guerrilla work and those who are indirectly disrupting the Japanese rule, there is no reason to live in the occupied areas. Now, it happens that the occupied areas are not allowed to linger on. Then, in addition to moving to the guerrilla force area, there is no doubt that they can only join the silk production camp in the rear. Fortunately, with the past experience of silkworm seed operators in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, whether in terms of operation or technology, it is enough to do pioneering work in a region where the silk industry is barren, and the government is also assisting.</p>
<p>(I think some larger seed farms are strong enough to advance on both routes at the same time.)</p>
<p>In short, if we can resolutely adopt these two routes as an emergency countermeasure under the current Japanese oppression, then what is lost in the east can still be recovered in the west. If we are frantic and willing to be economic slaves under the name of "cooperation" with the Japanese, and follow the example of silk factories in Wuxi and other places, then not only will the operators of silkworm seed farms ruin their personal reputation and become the scum of the silkworm industry, but they will also be criminals of the Chinese nation. For merit or for crime, it is all in this moment. While the Japanese are starting to attack silkworm seed factories in the war zone, and the silkworm seed factories themselves have not betrayed China and are willing to be vassals of the Japanese, I respectfully publish what I know in the newspapers to expose the Japanese conspiracy against the silkworm seed industry in the war zone and promote the rapid and profound awakening of the silkworm seed industry.</p>

<h3>After Three Battles, South China Defeats Kowloon and Secures Silver Shield Semi-Final Spot; Fung King-cheung Scores Twice with Excellent Headers</h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper) After two matches that failed to determine a winner, the South China South team faced the Kowloon Club in a special Silver Shield replay yesterday. The two teams held their third decisive battle at So Kon Po Stadium, attracting thousands of fans eager to witness the outcome.</p>
<p>This match was a matter of life and death for both teams. Failure meant elimination, so both sides were determined to win and secure a semi-final spot. After 70 minutes of intense competition, South China lived up to expectations, eliminating Kowloon with a score of 2-1. The match was a back-and-forth affair, filled with brilliant moments, truly a rare spectacle.</p>
<p>South China's performance was full of vigor, with Fung King-cheung, Cheung Wing-choi, and Leung Wing-chiu being particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>Lo Dou-man also returned to his usual form, playing a role in both goals. Li Yan-leung, in his debut major match, performed well, showing promise. It is hoped that the South China Football Committee will pay close attention to him, as he is destined for great things in the future.</p>
<p>South China's victory was due to the strong support from the half-back line, which moved forward and backward with coordination. Leung Wing-chiu was especially courageous. The forwards' ability to be active was largely due to their excellent performance, but also greatly benefited from the cover and support of the half-backs. However, Lau Hing-choi's movements seemed a bit slow, though he was able to remain calm and composed amidst the slowness.</p>
<p>Kowloon's defeat was due to being less skilled than their opponents. Moreover, the players placed too much importance on this match and were too eager, too anxious to win. As a result, their performance was erratic and excessive. Their five forwards created many opportunities and showed bursts of speed, but their anxiety led to disarray, and their coordination was lacking, often faltering in the final moments when penetrating South China's territory.</p>
<p>The three half-backs performed at most competently, with Beresford being especially seasoned and skilled. One of the inner-backs was also adequate. The goalkeeper, King Lai, seemed too serious, constantly worried about conceding when South China's forwards attacked, leading him to rush out of the goal several times, increasing the danger.</p>
<p>Match details are recorded below. The formations of the two teams during the match were as follows:</p>
<p>(South China South)</p>
<p>Cheung Wing-choi</p>
<p>Li Tin-sang, Mak Siu-han</p>
<p>Li Kwok-wai, Leung Wing-chiu, Lau Hing-choi</p>
<p>Lo Dou-man, Li Yan-leung, Fung King-cheung, Lai Siu-wing, Tang Kwong-sam</p>
<p>(Kowloon Club)</p>
<p>Kriegel</p>
<p>Nye</p>
<p>Wolfe</p>
<p>Lister</p>
<p>Knox</p>
<p>Nee, Beresford, Max</p>
<p>Borrows, Loveridge, Stephenson, Visocchi, Knowles</p>
<p>As the whistle blew, the god of war descended. The ordinary spectators held their breath, watching the unfolding drama.</p>
<p>King-cheung led the charge, clearing the way. He encountered Beresford halfway and battled for a round before being forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Borrows launched a rebellion on the flank, with fierce momentum. Siu-han, responsible for defending the territory, knew the attacker was ill-intentioned and swiftly intervened, causing the enemy general to flee.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Knowles launched a light cavalry sneak attack with malicious intent. Approaching the goal line, he cut the ball inside. Stephenson, thinking there was an opportunity, rushed forward, but before he reached the city walls, South China's defenders had already seized the "A Dou."</p>
<p>At this moment, Kowloon's three half-backs were covering the forward attack, leaving their defense vulnerable. They did not anticipate South China's counterattack to be so rapid. Just as they were about to turn back, King-cheung had already overtaken them. Seeing a promising path ahead, he passed the ball, and Dou-man, receiving it, advanced further. In an instant, he had penetrated deep into enemy territory. He then cut the ball perfectly, finding King-cheung, who was in great spirits. Seizing this golden opportunity, he had no reason to let it pass. As the ball descended, he struck it with his head, forcing the goalie's defenses to open up. Though he tried to save it, it was too late. The patriotic fans cheered, celebrating South China's opening goal.</p>
<p>After South China's victory, their morale soared. The five tigers of the forward line performed like dragons fighting for a pearl, like lions rolling a ball, a truly magnificent sight. Kowloon's defenders were trapped in a corner, their city on the verge of collapse. They barely managed to resist with all their might, preventing further losses. However, in this situation, it was clear that South China had the upper hand, and most spectators were convinced that victory would belong to South China.</p>
<p>After struggling for a while, Kowloon finally broke through. Beresford supported in midfield, and Stephenson, Visocchi, and Loveridge attacked from three directions. Wing-chiu met them head-on, exuding imposing authority. Soon after, Beresford took a free kick outside South China's fortress. Tin-sang headed the ball clear, protecting the capital.</p>
<p>Moments later, South China's vanguard launched another attack. Wolfe, seeing the approaching army, panicked, regretting his mistake of touching the ball with his hand. The referee, witnessing this, showed no favoritism, enforcing the law impartially and awarding a penalty kick. The patriotic fans were overjoyed, believing South China had found an opportunity to score another goal. However, King-cheung's kick lacked power, and Kriegel, alert and perceptive, saw King-cheung shoot to the right and followed the ball's trajectory, diving and successfully averting a disaster. A wave of sighs and applause arose from the stands.</p>
<p>Escaping danger, Kowloon's troops rallied, seeking weaknesses and launching a counterattack. Soon after, Borrows attacked from the left, firing a cold shot. Fortunately, Wing-choi was prepared and thwarted his plan. However, at this moment, Kowloon's offensive was strong, and in the blink of an eye, they forced a corner kick. The players gathered in front of South China's goal. Wolfe, stationed at the rear, also advanced, launching a long-range shot like a shooting star. Wing-choi, with quick eyes and hands, caught it cleanly.</p>
<p>King-cheung led the attack, and the situation looked promising, but several attempts failed to hit the target. After a while, Siu-wing tried his luck, launching a shot into the net. However, he was ruled offside, disappointing the patriotic fans.</p>
<p>The battle became increasingly intense, like hand-to-hand combat. The spectators were entranced, and both sides' forwards found opportunities to shoot, but they were all saved by the goalkeepers. The first half soon ended.</p>
<p>After a brief rest, the battle resumed. Kowloon's players were determined to recover lost ground, showing exceptional courage. Before anyone could react, Stephenson and Visocchi had reached the city walls. South China's defenders fought hard, and the situation stabilized.</p>
<p>Siu-wing received the ball and passed it to the left. Dou-man, catching it, went straight for the goal. Kriegel, seeing this, panicked and rushed out to intercept, but Dou-man outmaneuvered him. At this point, Kriegel was as good as a condemned prisoner, but Dou-man's final touch sent the ball wide. It was a great pity.</p>
<p>Kwong-sam rose to the occasion, leading his troops deep into enemy territory. He fired a shot at the goal, but it missed. However, Dou-man was lying in ambush on the left, waiting for an opportunity. Seeing the ball coming, he intercepted it perfectly. King-cheung, supporting in the center, repeated his previous tactic, scoring again with an excellent header. The audience cheered, shaking the valley, and South China's victory became even more assured.</p>
<p>Kowloon's players were disheartened by their repeated losses, especially the three forwards, who showed aggressive behavior in their desperate counterattacks.</p>
<p>During a midfield battle, Beresford suddenly passed the ball forward. Stephenson followed up with a thrust. Tin-sang, guarding the front line alone, should have been safe, but he carelessly slipped, creating an opportunity for Stephenson, who seized it and broke through. Wing-choi, in this desperate situation, had no way to save it. He opened the goal, allowing Stephenson to shoot and score. This loss for South China was completely undeserved. Even experienced players like Tin-sang can make unexpected mistakes.</p>
<p>Kowloon's unexpected goal was like finding life in a desperate situation, greatly boosting their morale. They aimed to score another goal and overturn the defeat, while South China's players wanted to maintain their lead and complete the victory. Therefore, everyone was preoccupied, and the situation was extremely tense.</p>
<p>Soon after, South China's three forwards launched an attack. Siu-wing rushed in, and Kriegel was trapped. Wolfe and Lister tried their best to rescue him. After some difficulties, they managed to avert disaster.</p>
<p>Borrows attacked, and Siu-han forcefully repelled him. Max, supporting from the road, launched a long-range shot. Wing-choi caught it cleanly.</p>
<p>After that, the two teams took turns attacking and defending, with many more brilliant moments, but the score remained unchanged. As the match ended, South China finally secured a 2-1 victory, eliminating Kowloon and securing a semi-final spot. (The Football God)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong-Shanghai Tennis Match: China Defeats Shanghai Students; China Recreation Club Wins Two Singles and Two Doubles; Only Li Huitang Lost One Game</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the Shanghai Student Tennis Team competed against the China Recreation Club team at the China Club court in Causeway Bay. As a result, the China Recreation Club won 4-1.</p>
<p>First Singles Match: By Hong Kong</p>
<p>The overall champion Tsui Wai-pui against Tang Po-ka, the Shanghai Chinese champion, the first game Tsui took the lead with three to zero, but was quickly caught up, making it a tie. Tsui was afraid of losing again, and quickly adopted net blocking and cross-court tactics, winning six to four. In the second game, Tang fought bravely, running tirelessly, but made frequent mistakes and lost several games in a row. Tsui then used long shots and short passes, feinting east and attacking west, to win the second game six to one. Total 2-0 victory.</p>
<p>Second Singles Match: Li Huitang vs. Li Kwok-fan, Li had a slight foot injury and was not agile, losing two games in a row.</p>
<p>Third Singles Match: By Li Yu-wing against Tsai Kwok-kei, the skills of both sides were comparable. The battle was very resilient, attacking and defending each other, and it took a long time to determine the result. So after the first singles and second singles games, the two of them were still in the second game. As a result, Li won two to one. The first doubles game Xu Jiang against Tang Li was one of the most exciting scenes in the game. Tang Li's connection and strength were far better than Xu's. Although Xu Jiang was able to take the lead with five to one in the first game, after Tang Li's rapid chase, they completed it in one go, making the situation five to five. Tang Li then won the first game eight to six. In the second game, Xu Jiang frequently went online, using a combination of pumping and pressing, and regained the lost ground six to four. In the third game, Jiang Daozhang gradually lost his strength, and his shots were not as good as before. Tang Li saw the weakness and repeatedly chopped the ball towards Jiang's side, causing Jiang to sweat profusely and pant like a bull. The scores of both sides were ebb and flow, and neither side would give in, making it difficult to distinguish. Xiao Xu finally used the net blocking skill again in the last two games, narrowly defeating Tang Li with eleven to nine.</p>
<p>Second Doubles Match: By Hung Yiu against Wai Tsai, Hung Yiu had a tacit cooperation and won two games in a row with six to one and six to three. The wins were easy. The scores of each game are listed below,</p>
<p>Singles</p>
<p>Tsui Wai-pui defeated Tong Po-ka</p>
<p>6-4 6-1</p>
<p>Li Huitang lost to Li Kwok-fan</p>

<h3>Movies and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment ... Three Loves Has Nancy</p>
<p>Is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy. The witty and lively dialogue, a lot of jokes, the vivid performances of the actors, plus a very interesting four-corner love story, make this film a very perfect and entertaining comedy.</p>
<p>The content is about a country girl going to a big city to find her fiancé, making a lot of jokes, and then how she had a crazy and hilarious love story with a writer and the publisher of the writer's books under special circumstances.</p>
<p>This film grasps a fragment of modern urban life and develops it, showing it very briskly. Director Rfchard Thorpe has very rich experience in handling comedies, not only sketching the whole film with an incomparably humorous style, but also every shot is full of rich humorous interest. Every inch of the film makes the audience have no chance to stop laughing. Jenna Kina plays the village girl in the film, showing a very cute personality. She portrays the pure and peaceful heart of a country girl and the distrust of urban friends very well, making her the most outstanding character in the film. Robert Montgomery and Frank Toton, who play the writer and publisher respectively, also have very wonderful and excellent performances. This film can be said to be the first collaboration and successful work of the three stars.</p>
<p>Queen ... A Man To Remember</p>
<p>For viewers who like touching stories, this film is the most ideal work. The film depicts the history of the life, failure, and success of a rural doctor, using a retrospective method to develop various scenes, narrating how the doctor served the society and the poor for twenty years with a spirit of sacrifice. At the same time, the film also unambiguously exposes the ugly state of selfishness and self-interest of villains in society.</p>
<p>Aiwa Ellis plays a doctor in the film who has no degree but has great ability and excellent talent. With the desire to serve the people, he returned to his hometown with his young son. But those who dared to trust him were only some poor farmers. The rewards he received were only some agricultural products. One of his harvests during a consultation was the baby girl he had just delivered for someone. He continued to struggle without discouragement, educating his son to get a very high degree, but to his disappointment, this son only pursued fame and money, with only the adopted daughter as his only help and comfort. Finally, he used his foresight to save the children of the whole village from a dangerous infectious disease, and only then did he receive the sincere respect and love of the whole village.</p>
<p>Ansa Li, who plays the doctor's adopted daughter, also has an excellent performance.</p>
<p>Also showing "The March of Time", which has a very detailed narrative and incisive dissection of the internal and external causes of Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Ping An ... The Storm</p>
<p>Describing the dissolute and indifferent lives of some seafarers, the director handles several tense scenes and climaxes in the film quite movingly. Charles Bohor plays a radio operator on a ship who gets into trouble everywhere, and how he bravely fights for his younger brother, and finally helps his sister-in-law save his brother's life in a storm.</p>
<p>The film describes the lives of people on the ship, how they squander their time and how they earnestly perform their duties, vividly and thoroughly. The performances of the actors show a kind of impatient and unreasonable personality, and the acting of fighting, causing trouble, drunkenness, flirting, and gambling are all vivid and energetic.</p>
<p>Eastern ... The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</p>
<p>A popular masterpiece by the American writer Mark Twain, which has been filmed once in the past. The excellent acting skills of the actress Missy Green may still be remembered by some people. This time, it is dyed in color, making the scenery of the countryside even more vivid. The performances of the two child stars Tommy Kelly and Angeles are also very moving. Tommy Kelly also fully shows that he is a promising child star - as long as there is a suitable script.</p>
<p>The movie is very long, but because the director's technique is superb and the tone is always light and smooth, people don't feel any slackness in it. This film can be regarded as a top-notch work for adapting a literary work into a movie.</p>
<p>Mero Robertson, who plays the grandmother, is also worth mentioning, although there are very few scenes.</p>
<p>Ta Hwa ... Double Wedding</p>
<p>William Powell and Mona Lo have been partners for a long time and have always given us a very good impression. Of course, there are many who love their films. This film is also very successful, although the plot is not how outstanding. Continuing the Cantonese film Seven Fresh Roses</p>
<p>The previous episode of Seven Fresh Roses said that Ma Lau-fun married Lin Mei-mei. This episode tells that after Lin gave birth, Ma and Lin had a bad relationship. At the same time, it also tells that after Feng Feng and Xu Man-li got married, they had conflicts due to a bad relationship, and each went to extremes. Then it tells that Ma Lau-fun met Xu Man-li by chance, and the two fell in love. The old couple found out and stated that Ma and Xu were originally engaged. So both sides realized and Ma fled even further. As a result, he was moved by his son and still returned home, and his love with Lin was as good as ever. A Midsummer Night's Dream</p>
<p>Central ... A Midsummer Night's Dream</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>Adapted from "Flowers in the Mirror", but it goes a step further than "Flowers in the Mirror". The whole play takes Xin Ma Shi-zeng as the starting point, telling that Xin Ma was originally a waiter in a teahouse. One night in his dream, he saw the God of Longevity, so the God of Longevity took him to various places to play, such as Nantianmen, Beitiandou, the land of giants, the land of dwarves, etc., allowing him to see all kinds of miracles he had never seen before. Watching this movie, you really just have to pretend you're dreaming.</p>
<p>The whole play, from beginning to end, is extremely scattered, and the plot has no central point at all. I believe progressive audiences will not welcome such films. The songs sung are a few old songs.</p>

<h3>On Women</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>Yu Yan's "Rotten Talks at the Banquet" volume states: "Man is like Heaven, woman is like Earth. The rain and dew of Heaven never fail to moisten, but the Earth has differences in fertility and barrenness. Some produce life, some do not. If the Earth is thin, saline, or full of rubble, to blame it for not producing life is like carving ice to make fire, or searching for red in a basket. It is merely wishful thinking and will yield nothing." This can indeed be called a new theory on women of the old days.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the verifiable documents of China, women have never attained the status of "person." Here, comparing women to the Earth, with its divisions of thinness and barrenness, and its capacity to produce life or not, is a representative concept of old traditional thought. I remember a common saying in my northeastern hometown, "Women are like seeds; they thrive when scattered on fertile land, and wither when scattered on barren land." This is another fatalistic view, comparing women to seeds, but ultimately, still not as a person.</p>
<p>The best representative of this view is our Confucius, who uttered the contemptuous words, "Only women and petty men are difficult to nurture." Because women are the most unreliable and difficult to restrain, there are strict ritual regulations in the ancient "Classic of Filial Piety": "Within the women's quarters, are rituals and righteousness complete?" Even in the era of Mencius, he believed that pacifying the world and dominating the four directions required first controlling women, as he said, "Regulate your wife, then your brothers, so as to govern your family and state." This clearly implies that "women are a source of trouble." To pacify the world, one must naturally first quell the source of trouble.</p>
<p>As for whether women are qualified as people, in ancient China, this case was quite difficult to argue because the prosecutor and plaintiff were both men, while women were fundamentally barred from court and denied the right to defend themselves. Consequently, a one-sided guilty verdict was rendered here.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the times are the advocate for women. Today, it seems that all the guilty verdicts of the past have been overturned, and women can follow the times and gradually embark on a new path. At the same time, some women today have not only caught up with the times but are also ahead of the times, acting as teachers to men.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, women's endeavors seem to always be skewed toward one aspect of development. For example, Japanese women are dedicated to sacrificing their bodies as the best strategy for serving the nation and developing national power. Even we use "Japan relies on soldiers, ronin, and prostitutes" as a derogatory saying about Japan.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country, nine months ago, a Chinese woman in Nanyang even proclaimed a vow to dedicate herself to the nation, promising to become a lifelong partner to anyone who purchased 10,000 yuan of national bonds. Unfortunately, this occurred in Nanyang, and there has been no follow-up. Furthermore, a news item was published in a certain evening newspaper on September 23rd of last year:</p>
<p>"Recently, Chinese and Western individuals held a banquet at the Wuzhou Chinese-Western Restaurant. When the wine was flowing freely, a Mr. X from the Asia Company proposed that if any female students were willing to offer a kiss, the gentlemen present would compete to donate money. The one who donated the most would receive the kiss. As a result, in a short time, thousands of yuan were collected. Mr. Tom, a Westerner, donated the most, offering 340 yuan each to female students Hua Jichen and Jie Zhen for a kiss."</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this represents an outflow of rights and interests, exchanging a kiss for hundreds of legal tender seems like a very worthwhile deal. Moreover, the ones offering kisses were single women. Of course, to align with the current principle of "everyone striving to save the nation in their respective positions," some might think this is the most appropriate thing to do.</p>
<p>However, the Nanyang Chinese woman's call for a husband to save the nation is not very reasonable. As for the Wuzhou students offering kisses, it was still proposed during the "wine-fueled enthusiasm" of men. Such methods of saving the nation are certainly not what we endorse because women in the new era have already created a nobler, greater, and holier path in today's war of resistance.

<h3>Ruins and Gunsmoke</h3>
<p>— Written by Shiro Ozaki, translated by Huanping Lin</p>
<p>The Colonel, while explaining, spoke to her frequently with an attitude that was both familiar and distant. Someone in the group took out a cigarette to offer her. She made a surprised face and refused. When it was offered to her again and again, a girlish shyness surfaced on her face. She reluctantly took it, lit it, and began to smoke it with great enjoyment. In the square a little earlier, there was a coolie with a villainous appearance, using a knife that did not seem sharp enough to cut off the meat tightly adhering to a raw pigskin. In Hukou, it was said that the mountain painter Hiroshi Kitchida had already been there for a week. Led by Lieutenant Tanaka, we climbed Stone Bell Mountain, and soon we were covered in sweat. When we came down, the mooring base had prepared lunch. Canned beef and red-eyed fish—a pot of cold sake was also placed before my dining table. Here, we met Mr. Yoshida, who at first glance seemed like a reserve officer. He clinked glasses and drank with Lieutenant Matsuoka, our guide, who was sitting next to him, and they gradually became drunk. In the afternoon, we took a sampan prepared by Colonel Inoue and climbed Great Aunt Mountain, which stood in the middle of the lake. If there were any old Chinese people who had not escaped, they could probably hear all sorts of legends. The lake was probably full of bottomless legends; Great Aunt Mountain harbored the historical image of two thousand years. It was said that even schools of fish going up the river would first make a greeting before passing Great Aunt Mountain. The origin of this custom was untraceable. But Colonel Inoue also said that today was the first time he had climbed Great Aunt Mountain. "Probably, apart from the military, you are the first Japanese to climb this mountain," he said. From the sampan near Great Aunt Mountain, I looked back at the cityscape of Hukou several times. The afternoon sun shone brightly. But this ruined city seemed to have completely lost the strength to rise again from this odorless silence. On rainy nights, looking out from the windows of the mooring base headquarters, a blue fire flickered in the dark shade of the mountains. Colonel Inoue said this, and his face darkened: "It's not one or two, it's five or six overlapping, wandering like they are lost from this mountain to that valley. At first, I thought it wasn't a guerrilla team of X people? So, in the night, I ordered the guards to set out to see, but there was no trace of that, and, moreover, there were no corpses of X people nearby. It seems like it's will-o'-the-wisp, but it's hard to say."</p>
<p>Listening to his conversation, the desolate night street turned into a bizarre form, floating into my mind. The war shattered all the strange phenomena that arose in the peripheral nerves and progressed. Today, in the gaps between the appearance of ghosts hiding personal hatred, there are probably none anymore. I think there probably won't be another chance for me to revisit this city alive. (End)</p>
<p>Postscript: The author, Shiro Ozaki, is a famous Japanese pure art writer. He writes war literature with the pursuit of artistic beauty as the primary premise. The aggressive intentions of the Japanese militarists do not seem to play a guiding role in his mind. Therefore, his works are more objective and more in line with the facts. The translator once translated his "Yangtze River Autumn," which was serially published in the "Shen Bao" on December 14, 5, 6, and 7 of last year, and was well-received by readers. This so-called work is published in the New Year's issue of "Reconstruction" magazine. "Ruins and Gunsmoke" is the overall title, divided into four chapters: "In Hukou," "Great Aunt Mountain," "The Romanticism of the Sky," and "Changes in Color." This article is only a selected translation of the first chapter, "In Hukou," because the other three chapters are not worth translating. A few places in the text have been deleted by the translator, specifically mentioned.</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the Psychology of Traitors</h3>
<p>— Ge'er</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people once conducted a "psychological analysis" of "traitors." It is said that there are four reasons for the emergence of "traitors": (1) those who do not deeply understand the suffering of being a subjugated people and are either money-worshipers or unemployed; (2) those who believe that resistance will inevitably fail and attempt to establish false merit in advance; (3) those who have received imperial salaries and therefore wish to repay imperial favor; (4) those who are completely ignorant and are either money-worshipers or unemployed.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for the emergence of "traitors" in the above items 1 and 4, we can persuade "money-worshipers and the unemployed." Up until now, the brutal acts of the X people have long proven that being a subjugated people is something one should never do. "Japanese Atrocities Eyewitnessed by Foreigners" by the famous British journalist H.J. Timperley is the best book to record the suffering of being a subjugated people. In addition to this, we must also provide relief to the unemployed. Otherwise, asking them to practice saving the country on an empty stomach would mean that the kind of "Bo Yi and Shu Qi" who "refuse to eat the grain of Zhou" probably cannot be found among the "ignorant." In fact, we certainly cannot ask them to learn from "Bo Yi and Shu Qi." The story of "Bo Yi and Shu Qi" should be remembered by the "wealthy and powerful" who are "well-fed and clothed."</p>
<p>Regarding such "traitors" as in items 1 and 3, they are "incurable," and we must inflict relentless flogging upon them. If possible, it would not be excessive to "punish" them by eating their flesh and sleeping on their skin.</p>
<p>Those who have received imperial salaries and therefore repay their imperial favor have long been unworthy of being human. They have already become slaves by nature. This is the true nature of all "house dogs." It is a disgrace to bestow the "title" of "human" upon them. If such "things" are tolerated to exist in the world, they will indeed leave behind endless harm. If they are not eliminated, the future of humanity is truly unimaginable!</p>
<p>However, even more detestable are those "opportunists" who consider themselves "outstanding individuals" who "understand current affairs." Seeing the brutal force of the X people's "three axes," they believe that they are bound to win, and that their own side is bound to lose. Therefore, in order to establish false merit in advance, they glorify themselves by saying, "Who will go to hell if I don't?" and boldly take on "positions" such as "committee member" or "mayor." Of course, some "smart people" adhere to the "three no's policy." They seem to neither desire to establish "false merit" nor appear as solemn "saviors." However, these people are even more detestable. The so-called "cave-dwelling red viper" refers to these cunning and scheming individuals. However, this is not within the scope of my words.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Shanghai "mayor," Chuan Xiaoan, who rides the wind and sees the rudder, embraces the "China will inevitably lose" theory, and establishes false merit in advance, he has recently "shown signs of remorse." The reason is that "the time of China's final victory is indeed unreachable." Therefore, he is extremely dismayed and believes that "in six months, he will probably no longer be able to stand on his feet in Shanghai." This so-called "showing signs of remorse" should not be regarded as his "repentance." Rather, China's protracted war of resistance will only eliminate those who take advantage of opportunities. From the perspective of building a new China in the future, it is indeed very beneficial. The War of Resistance is truly great. Opinions for reporters in Dongjiang</p>
<h3>We Must Faithfully Expose</h3>
<p>— Peng Tai</p>
<p>Opinions for Reporters in Dongjiang</p>
<p>Dongjiang, which was once ravaged by the X people, has many aspects, such as disaster relief, the current government leadership, and the people's sentiments, that are worth reporting to allow overseas Chinese to provide more enthusiastic relief and to allow compatriots living far away to care. How heavy is the responsibility of our reporters? Reporters?</p>
<p>The performance of the work has given us concrete proof: The work of the reporters in Dongjiang is still far from their mission. Although some bravely went to the Bo Zeng and Wan border areas, the closest to the X people's fire line, and some painstakingly stepped on the most remote places, it is still not enough. Everyone must admit it!</p>
<p>1.  They can only circle around on lines and points: You can see by flipping through various newspapers. It proves that the reporter's footsteps can only seem to occupy our rivers and mountains like the X people, only in the small area inside the city, around the rivers and roads. For example, the left-wing offensive area during the X people's landing, Apojiao, Renshan, Pinghai, Lingkeng. Baimanghua, Pingshan, Hengyun, Taiwei... and the right-wing Xayong, Aotou, Jinggang, Kwai Chung... areas, were painfully forgotten and not valued. The materials there will definitely not be more valuable than Danshui, Longgang, Huicheng, and Boluo City! That place is already a place where the government's reach is beyond and the work of resisting the enemy is not well done on weekdays. The brutality of the X people, the cunning tricks used by the X people, the misery of the compatriots, and the severity of the disaster all have special blood and tears, which is what people urgently want to know!</p>
<p>2.  Upper-level interviews cannot understand the people's sentiments at the lower levels: Yes, many disaster statistics and governance plans rely on the institutions to give us more complete ones, but they are one-sided and cannot contain everything. What's more, official clichés have been passed down since ancient times? Therefore, we must be close to the people and get the truth from their frank outpouring because they are still dealing with the X people when the X people come. The strangeness in the lost land is something we can't even dream of. Many strange legends are still circulating in front of us, which is indeed material that cannot be abandoned. This is a reflection of the real phenomenon!</p>
<p>3.  Ignoring the hidden pain due to the surface: If you simply write that a few houses were burned down in a certain place, how many people died in a certain place, and empty words such as "the scene is very miserable" and "blood and bones are all over the place," at most it will only temporarily arouse people! As for the farmers whose thousands of acres of bowing rice ears were eaten up by the enemy's donkeys and horses and who did not harvest, when the enemy occupied them, they were threatened and intimidated by the traitors of the maintenance society, and now they are being openly defrauded and secretly squeezed by many people who took the name of the government or armed forces, and forced to extract them, they can't stand it anymore, so they said angrily: "Damn it, we suffered from the 'foreign' ×××, and now we are suffering from the anger of these 'local' ××× sons"? Clear-eyed people certainly know that these words are entirely because they are too tired. The bandits in various parts of Dongjiang have gradually forgotten the "pain of ××× destroying our country and exterminating our species," and the heart of resisting Japan and saving the country has numbly changed, thinking of scraping from the people to make themselves comfortable, we must expose these.</p>
<p>4.  We should frankly point out the gambling in Dongjiang, as well as the smuggling in Dongjiang, and the phenomena that are more or less unavoidable among the various groups in Dongjiang; to the attention of the comrades who save the country, and also to the knowledge of the higher-level government agencies.</p>
<p>And……</p>
<p>The above are all things that we have not done enough, and perhaps we have not paid much attention to them until now. Of course, there are many reasons to limit us and stop us, such as the fact that the security in many places is not peaceful, the traffic in many places is too difficult, and the days we have come to Dongjiang are really short.</p>
<p>In short, in the past, we did little strikes, did our own things, and went our own way, so we did not bear enough responsibility.</p>
<p>In the future, we must organize ourselves, unite together, and converge everyone's opinions, then the problem can be solved layer by layer like a chef peeling spring bamboo shoots! Dongjiang has its revolutionary tradition, and Dongjiang is still a good place for X people to send their lives. We in Dongjiang have the divine duty to promote everything.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to respond to the call to "unite the reporters of Dongjiang," as a fervent expectation. 1939, 2, 3.</p>
<h3>The Song of the Wanderer</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shuipai</p>
<p>Crying is not enough, it is superfluous.</p>
<p>Under the steps of a foreign city, you are a wanderer. Gleaming floors, ochre lips, do not breed compassion, and compassion is not worth much.</p>
<p>Tears cannot conceive, that city, that village, the green homeland, the productive fields, the rivers, and your fellow villagers, like in your dreams, are buried. Buried by black dust, when the killing bird flaps its wings like leather. Violent madness… Tears cannot cleanse these, to make this land suitable for people to live in, a thicker, colored fluid is needed.</p>
