<p>社評</p>
<h3>蔣委員長抗戰必勝的基本論據</h3>
<p>蔣委員長在第五届中央執行委員會第五次全體會議上致開會詞，精密分析×我的情勢，指示我國抗戰必勝的理由，及努力保障必勝條件的具體辦法，實是我們四萬萬五千萬國民抗戰及爭生存的最高指針，是所有中國國民皆應細加誦讀並遵行的金科玉律。全文長約萬餘育，其內容則可分成兩大部分，前半部可以說是抗戰必勝的基本論據，而後半部是爭取抗戰勝利的具體辦法。茲就所指示各點略加申論，以盡與論界傳達領袖指針的責任。因限於篇幅，故分兩部分略抒所見。先自抗戰必勝的基本論據說起：</p>
<p>（一）抗戰的决心與必勝的信心是我們全面抗戰爭得最後勝利的基本動力，無此决心與信心，則不但我們的勝利不能有保障，卽連抗戰也都不能持續。我們以積弱的老大國家竟能對軍備相當現代化機械化的國家抗戰至十八個月之久，並且愈戰愈強，都是出於這個信心與决心。自信之高產生行動之堅决。在我們的「信心」當中，還存有「共信」與「互信」。在我們整個生死存亡的嚴重關頭上，四萬萬五千萬人民已有一個共同的信念，就是不抗戰到底以爭取最後的勝利和民族的解放，則將淪為異族的奴隸，永無翻身之地。除此共信之外，「互信」的關係也非常重要。國民黨與共產黨以至各黨各派之能够消除旣往嫌隙及成見，切實合作以抵禦外來壓迫，卽是出於這個互信。由共信產互信，由有此兩種信心，始有共同抗戰到底的决心。所以此後如何設法增加「互信」之誠，提高「共信」之篤，就是增强抗戰基本動力的第一大前提。</p>
<p>（二）我們抗戰到底的信心與决心，不是憑空掉下的，而是有科學的根據的。這個科學的根據就是對於×我雙方以至國際情勢的客觀的認識和正確的推斷。古來兵家有云：「知己知彼百戰百勝」，×人今日之陷於進退維谷，作戰慌亂，原因卽在於此不知己知彼，也卽客觀情勢之認識與推斷不正確所致。在第一期抗戰陣營中，也有多少不良份子，對於抗戰沒有信心和决心，始終在動搖不定的狀態下，致使我們的全面抗戰受到多少的惡影響，原因也卽在於他們不認識×人必敗的原因，或把×人的力量估量得過高，或把中日戰爭作單獨的個別的估計而離開了世界的關係。×人終必敗亡固由於我們抗戰到底，但是因我們抗戰到底而產生的許多國際問題，也是加速×人敗亡的主要因素；我們終必勝利固由於我們英勇的抗戰，但是因我們英勇抗戰保衛國際公約及世界正義而獲得各國的同情與贊助，也是增強我們勝利的巨大力量。所以正確認識×人及世界必然的重向，是維持並加強我們抗戰信心及决心的科學的根據。我們此後應當更加積極推進×人各方面情形及國際互相牽制的必然動向的研究。我們有了這種積極的研究和由此所得的正確認識，則不但可以增強抗戰的信心和决心，並且可以獲得樹立抗戰的政略及戰略的根據。</p>
<p>（三）蔣委員長提出×人必定敗亡的主張幷列舉許多事實以為佐證，精密而又確切：第一，×人此次侵略戰爭，違反它的大陸政策的步驟；第二，×人對我國及世界的認識不正確；第三，違反三個軍事上的原則，犯了軍事上的三個忌；第四，它對我及世界各國所採取的政略錯誤。第五，×人對我民族的偉大力量及時代的猛烈潮流，完全忽視了。總而言之，瘋狂的×人不但沒有認識淸楚它的對方，並且沒有認識淸楚時代性，它以元淸時代的眼光來評價廿世紀的新中國，是它最大的致命傷。×人犯了上述的錯誤，也就是它在戰爭上造下深大的弱點，我們在推進抗戰的過程上，必須嚴密把握住這些弱點而加以擴大和加深，以速×人敗亡時期之到來。例如在我們方面擴大抗戰的宣傳，加強我們的抗戰力量；在外交方面嚴密切實聯絡我們的與國，造成反抗世界侵略集團的偉大力量，這不但可以增加我們的力量，並且可以孤立×人及其帮兇。當此時代，黷武好戰侵略蠻幹的國家究竟少，而愛好眞正和平維護正義的國家總是多得多，也就是說後者的力量始終是大過前者的力量多多。所以我們如果切實聯絡眞正愛好和平的國家，促使她們的偉大潛勢力完全表現出來，並促其密切聯結在一起，則侵略者完全孤立，而勢力削弱。但是此種眞正和平力量的發動和聯絡，其進行方法要有前後及輕重之別，必須先自愛好和平最切而擁護正義最積極的國家入手；其後乃依次推進。至於判斷愛好和平及擁護正義成份濃薄的標準，也不困難，視乎各國本國與我國關係之密切程度，卽可决定。總理遺敎中有曰：「聯絡平等待我之各民族共同奮鬥」，卽指示此種决定先後親疎的最好指針。</p>
<p>（四）然而在蔣委員長抗戰必勝的基本論據當中，首推如何保障抗戰必勝的基本條件，為最重要。這個基本條件，究竟是什應呢？沒有別的，就是「不授×以可乘之隙」，換言之，就是我們不要意志有所動搖，不要自甘屈服，更不要中途求妥協。我全面抗戰的最終目的不是求苟安，或妥協的解决，而是求民族革命的完成，平等自由的新中國的榭立，所以要謀根本的解决，爭取最後的勝利。自今日的情勢看來，日本帝國主義存在則中華民族的禍患不能消除，已經達到有×無我，有我無×的階段了。×人已經滿身瘡痍，病入膏盲。它正急於設法解脫他無法補救的苦境，補救無可挽救的弱點。我們更要握緊這一緊要關頭，把它推上敗亡的路程。這正如蔣委員長所指示：「我們能持久抗戰，必能得到勝利，如不能堅决抵抗，而與×妥協，訂什麼和約，那×人就可以根據着屈服條約上它所享受的地位，更無止境地深入。到了這個地步，……全部中國，無論何地，無論何人，都要受×人的宰割蹂躪，萬無倖全之理，……這就無異於犧牲我們中國自己世世子孫未來的生命，反而延緩了×國的危亡了」。我們應該怎樣在這艱難地步上咬緊牙根，把握住這一基本條件，以保障抗戰必勝之到來，是目最前關緊要的問題。</p>
<h3>五中全會開幕　蔣總裁致詞全文　（續昨第三版）</h3>
<p>自從×國政府和他首相近衛先後發表聲明以來、他這一個呑倂中國以獨霸太平洋、侵略全世界的陰謀、已是舉世共曉、不待再說、我現在所要向各位同志講明的、就是×國目前已經失敗、且有種種理由、證明他最後一定要遭受最大的失敗、我們祇要奮鬥下去、就有必然勝利的把握、先就×人方面來說、且不提這十八個月以來、他在我中國南北各戰塲上、死傷了七十萬以上的官兵、消耗了九十萬萬的戰費、弄到他國內羅掘俱窮、農工停滯、社會墮落、釀成政治上的騷亂不安、這些還都是有形的跡象、就是從他發動侵略到現在、一切戰略政略上的運用、以及對我們中國的觀測預計、和他對時代的認識來議，實在是處處違反了原理、步步陷入於錯誤、當此成敗利鈍存亡絕續之交、我要根據眞切的事實、為全會列舉×人必然失敗的事例、對各位同志、提出詳盡的分析報吿、</p>
<p>第一、×國這次發動侵略、人人知道是實行他的大陸政策、所謂大陸政策、依照他們內定機密的傳統政策、和他們公開的田中奏摺、是要先佔滿蒙、再圖侵略我們中國的全部、乃至獨霸亞洲、統一全球、但他們在佔領東北尙未穩定之時、而就要來侵佔華北、他的力量達到華北以後、又由慢性的侵蝕、變為急性的鯨呑、于是公然來佔我們平津、這已經和他所謂大陸政策旣定的國策與戰略、完全是背道而馳了、不單如此、他還要再進而至於華中、甚至侵廣州、這楚他史進一步的來破壞他們自己的傳統政策了、他進入了華中華南以後、不但戰略上陷入進退不能的地步、口是政略上、也迫令他不能不見　於世界列强、而使×陷入於四面楚歌的絕境、這是他第一件必敗之道、</p>
<p>第二、他對我們中國最初的企岡、是要不戰而屈、但我們終於戰而不屈、已經出其意計所及了、旣戰之後、他就想速戰速决、但自南就、淞滬、折口、南京、一直到了魯南會戰、以及鄱陽湖邊、大別山脈之戰、一步步深入、終於不能速戰速決、於是反轉來又渴望速和速結、在我們未退出武漢以前、他的雜誌報章上、就竭力鼓吹中止戰事、或設法停戰、一面用種種狡計詭謀、想誘我們入殼、欺騙世界、圓取便宜、但是不久、他又圖窮匕見、拿出他所謂興亞院「東亞協同體」終於被×欺誘降服、並非我們全民族的滅亡、現在×人竟妄想在『建立東亞新秩序」的口號之下、於短期內、遂行統制我們中國的夢想、他全不想想他侵略我們東北、費了四十年以上的光陰，（轉入第三版）</p>
<h3>從風浪裡長大起來</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　林衡</p>
<p>抗先惠陽縣隊部成立前後特寫</p>
<p>『工作的表現』鬥爭的精神，自然有人們去認識，惠州的靑年在高度的熱望着你們繼續惠陽抗先的組織啊</p>
<p>「……</p>
<p>『最後請你原諒我不在這裏簽上姓名—再談吧謹致敬禮！並向抗先同志致敬！』</p>
<p>信讀完了，會場寂靜得只能聽人們緊急的呼吸聲分明他們在憤激和想恨。『抗先同志團結起來，發揚抗先的友愛精神，堅苦奮鬥的作風……』大家跟何君高呼着，這口號收效很大，每個人的面孔，呈現出與奮的表情，有人開始笑了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在活潑，團結，緊張，狂歡的今天，他們遝記住昨天的微波。</p>
<p>開過了好幾天的經常座談會，參加座談曾的靑年共四十二人，全部加入廣東靑年抗日先鋒隊惠陽縣隊部，在成立會開幕的前一天，他們還在座談着政治哲學問題。突然有人提議了，惠陽靑年應當另成立一個組織，不應加入抗先，接着有許多人附和，於是你來幾句我說幾聲，會塲秩序混亂了，一會兒又有人提議取消抗先惠陽縣隊部組織而成立惠陽靑年抗×聯合會，很顯明的誰也可以看出，這會有人在破佈置壞。</p>
<p>會塲混亂了，爭辯了半個鐘頭、倒搗份子充份表現出無恥，昨天還高呼着「我們要為抗先而奮鬥到底」「鞏固和擴大抗先組織』但今天却以冷嘲熱諷的態度來破壞它。</p>
<p>正在鬧得最要緊的時候，他們的區隊部林副隊長出現在廳中長桌的旁邊，林君站着，立卽把所有的人們的視綫，都集中在他的臉上。</p>
<p>「各位同志」林君開始說話了，「今天這件事情的發生，很明顯的我們可以看到有人在佈置破壞抗先惠陽縣隊部的組織，這早是我們意料中的車情」他解釋了一會又往下說：「好！旣然有人忘記自己在昨天還高呼着「我們要為擴大和鞏固抗先而奮鬥」的口號，那麼就讓他欺騙自己吧，我們給他一個機會，准他們立卽報名退出抗先……」</p>
<p>會場的空氣更加緊張起來，要退出抗先的人，都先後站起來報名了，有些在解譯說自已家庭環境不許，暫時不加入抗先，同時也有一位女子要求參加抗先組班。</p>
<p>「……抗先幹部訓練班，還會依常的繼續着，我們歡迎非抗先的同志參加聽講……對於因環境被迫退出抗先的同志，我們很希望他們於克服困難後才參加抗先……現在散會但請抗先同志留步。」林君再向他們做這樣的宣佈，織着有十二人離開了會場，一步出圖書館以後，有一位主腦在責備着其餘的人說道：『為什麼你們不佈置全部退出』？</p>
<p>樓上的會場煥然一新了，再也沒有鬧亂的現象，他們她們從新的座談起來，首先分析今天微波的起因和可能的影響，據其中的一位靑年報吿，今天早晨惠陽靑年另在縣一中召集座談會，會塲中有人在恐嚇他們，說加入抗先會隨時被調動出發遠離家鄕，說本地人不應給省靑年領導，還有人說抗先壞話，更有人到新同志的家庭去造謠，把抗先的活潑精神解釋為浪漫，叫他們的家長不讓子女參加抗先隊……這事實證明了更加證明着有人在破壞抗先，「抗日先鋒隊隊員第一個基本條件，是要據有政治堅定性，今天退出抗先的那些動搖份子機會主議者是不能久留在抗先的隊伍中的，他們不在將來退出而在今天退出，使抗先純潔化了，這於抗先是有利的，」主席的結論結束了微波的分折。最後他們討論今後的集訓和工作問題，高女士提議增加集訓時間「每天四小時」李君要求增加，民衆運動，中國革命問題等踝程，無疑的集訓的內容是更加豐富了，這就是說「這新生的小孩子有了豐富的滋養，他的前途一定是很光明的。」記者這樣想着。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>距上課時間還有二十分鐘，隊員們都到齊了，有些唱昨天才學會的「打到×人的後方去」，有些都低聲唱着，「送出總勇士歌」廖君太興奮了，不怕羞，他也打開他那「豆沙喉」唱起他最近的傑作——抗×先鋒歌，有些隊員却哈冷地談笑着，廳中熱鬧極了，三二「書虫」便偷偷地拿着書報走到房千裏吃他們的　去了，工作大家被打擾了，他只好停筆，將新同志的文章和劇本留下下次再修改。</p>
<p>「上課時間到了」值日向大家宜佈着，不一會隊員們便一排一排的坐下來，整個空氣都轉變了，拿出筆記簿他們嚴肅緊張地記錄，游擊戰術，持久戰，辯證法，十七个月來的抗戰總結，汪精衛出賣民族經過的報吿……這些新的智識加强了惠州靑年的學習興趣，使他們每个人都感覺着幸福，過着生平沒有這樣豐富的生活。</p>
<p>他們通過了新參加組織的七位候補隊員，准予成為正式隊員，他們還决定提高隊員在家庭的地位，全體員分別到每個隊員的家裏去訪問，對正在籌備成立的　靑抗聯會，他們通過了不許仇視而應積極贊助成立並鞏固其組織，最後還决定拜會當局，誰商召集惠陽靑年反汪擁護五中全會共會。</p>
<p>記得是他們出發別縣工作的那二天，出發的時間到了，然而徵雨還是不停的跟着北風打來，打倒戰十們的帽子上，臉上，衣服上，帽子上和險上的積水又從上流了下來，有人在打寒噤，可是，誰也沒有怨苦，沒有着願意掉在後面當「烏龜」，挺起胸，鼓着氣，急唱游擊隊歌，他們一步二步的前進着，忽然一部份的隊昌停下來了，向繼續走着的戰士們招手唱大：「歡送同志們，歡送同志們，到博羅，積極努力工作，積極努力工作，同志們，同志們，」</p>
<p>于惠州城正月十九日</p>

，已給×機炸燬，現在遷設在被×機炸燦的博羅縣府原址縣中學內。那時黃縣長剛出席賑濟委員會議，到了那天的晚上方才會見。黃縣長具有誠懇的風度，溫和的神態，首先給人一個很好的印象，四十開外的年紀，魁梧的體格，儀表也很穩重而英挺，平常都是輕身滅從，往來市上，尤能擺晚了舊官僚的氣習。他本是一個軍人，但從事政治工作頗久，原屬適合於戰時的一員行政畏官。就一般縣民的批評，他江內的政績毫不見壞，不過仍欠缺一些勁幹的精神。　　因為黃縣長的不暇，記者便和簫劍雄科長作一次長談。蕭先生原是縣府的第三科長，現在改為軍事科長。在縣府轉移期的兩個月奮鬥中，他都親自參與。記者便的詢問轉移奮鬥的經過為題，作了我們談話的開端。　　蕭科長說，十日十五晚，×入佔領惠州後，沿惠博公路迫近了協羅城郊。縣府得到了一五一師參謀長吳涵的通知，明知時機極急，於是由黃縣長率領了數十名職員夤夜撤退。由田牌而，拓頭，而平安墟，而洛洞，而官山，而黃竹坳，而路溪，後冉移至顯村。當×人已從慰廣公路博增段及博（羅）龍（門）公路作爾綿大包圍，直趨增城，縣府正陷入×人的包圍內，遂徘徊於博羅龍門邊區的大山中，發動當地的自圍團隊行施襲擊。最猛烈的柏塘，路溪諸役曾繳獲×人輕機槍兩挺，步槍數十枝，并搜得敵人軍事機密的作戰敎令一書。十二月十二日，接到敵人撤退的消息，才從顯村回縣，辦理善後工作。　　休息了一會，他還附帶的說，他們在縣屬內流浪了兩個月，同事們全穿着夏衣，出沒在山嵐的烟瘴中，很多染病，財政科的吳科長且在中途病故」。自然，在這次的慘變中，有不少的人受雞或死亡。不過能够在這大時代中為國犧牲，也是壯烈的。　　最後，他把黃縣長今後的施政方針，分點的吿訴記者，現在正好概述出來，作這篇記事的結論。我覺得黃縣長能够着實的苦幹，博羅雖受刧，前途也是光明的。　　一、自衛，整理各團隊，加强舊有，植扶新生，設立幹部敎導隊，訓練新幹部。　　二、治安，維持地方秩序，嚴禁非法行動。由縣府擬具非常時期禁令六項，通吿各鄕公佈，嚴厲執行。一，做漢奸者，二，搶劫者，三，據賣婦女者，四，賭博者，五，破壞車事交通者，六，擅取財物者：一律槍决。　　三、行政，將縣府舊有四科改分為軍事，政治，總務，財務四科，適合戰時需要，建立新的機構。　　四，救濟，一方派政治科長劉蓉赴港呼籲，一方面將省府賑欵一萬五千元分配救濟，十分之四以工代賑，從事破壤公路，興築防禦工事，其餘舉辦施粥及分派各鄉，統計被難縣民約七八萬名，棉衣藥品極感缺乏。　　五，產生，掩埋市內及鄕道屍體，消毒房屋，以重淸潔，幷籌備贈醫施藥，拯救疾病。　　六，其他，如軍事通訊……，許多稍輕的工作。　　從這行政大綱的提示中，我們全少可以相信博羅的善後是有辦法的。×人能摧毀我們的物質，却不能摧毀我們的心，博羅人民要决心從灰盡中建起更新更偉大的博羅。　　（完）</p>

<p>交通旅行西北行（續昨）  麥羣玉　　來之軍人同房，始免露宿。旅館房間很像羊　，一坑之外無他物，房租六角一日。車站食堂，每碟菜起碼三角，白飯每小碗為一角，且砂粒極夥。晚上與同宿的軍人談及奪夏之情形和軍人的主張，覺得中國前途光明，指日可見。　　邠縣城週九里，涇水北繞，依汾岩為城而北向，居民一如乾縣：商業街道，較乾縣為好。昔古公亶父誕生於此，為周之發祥地，自今觀之，不知地靈何處　　十四日晨起，水濕處盡是冰塊，旅客相率豋車，而機師突然宣佈車已壞了，滿懷高興的旅客，個個緘默無聲；機帥並不加緊修理，只是助手在車底　來扒去，直至九時始行，車沿汾岩下行，有壽慶寺，佛欽羅列岩下，佔地約半里，為一名勝之地。沿途梨棗成林，十時至長武，縣治在嶺上，文化經濟落後。出縣城北行，堡壘相連，經窰店，此為秦隴分界處，房屋數橡，簡陋不堪。越此沿涇水行，十二時抵涇川。　　涇川城週三里，依山帶水，為秦入隴第一要塞。宋代與西夏相持，韓，范開府於此；左文襄西征時亦以此為據。城東山坡上，即郭汾陽單騎見回紇處。居民多中鴉片毒，當此大寒之候，小孩仍無褲可着，所衣　單衣而已。車站所售之物，無一不價格奇昂。由此沿涇水向西北行五里，即西王母瑤台。山坡樓閣玲瓏，古木奇悔。相傳周穆王駕八駿會王母於瑤池，即是此處。前行只見童山濯濯，人跡罕見，但堡壘林立，駐以隊伍，三時半抵平凉。　　平凉為隴東軍事之區，交通八達，城週僅次於西安，商業繁榮；位於羣山中，氣候平常，生活程度極低。車站旅館房金每天八角，房子較邠縣為好，傢私也不過多樓子一張而已。城后商西山，卽黃帝問道於廣成子之處。　　翌晨，車行時刻遲至十時半。本來規定時間是七時開行，但機師尙未起來，因誤時間；站長臨時掛牌定為九時，是時進有查票員與站長登車查票，旅客因質問站長而發生衝突，站長說：『這時我的事，你管不着。』幾致動武。　　十一時三分過涇水經篙店，有數十家，西行峯巒壁立至三關口（即彈筆峽），口寬僅三餘丈，半為山溪，所餘者僅可容車而已。眞可謂『一夫當關，萬夫莫當。」之險，此即宋代名將楊延昭鎮守之處。口東有楊延昭廟及關帝廟，日有碑一所，字跡糢糊，不知所述何事，聞曩時此口不能通大車，自左文襄開築後始通。口西峽寬僅數十武，車從縣崖下過，十里始見民房十餘間，此卽瓦亭，分二道，向西北行者為往寗夏要道；西南行者為西蘭路，　　車朝南折西行，巍巍之六盤山在目矣。是時有護車隊相率登車，聞此去為盜匪出沒之區，非此不足以保障安全也。車沿公路向山頂過進，峯回路轉，漸昇高處，下望羣山，積雪未溶，如乘飛機置身雲端，六盤山高出海　萬餘尺，為隴中之各山，元太祖征歐歸來即崩於此，英雄名山，永垂不朽。山之西麓楊家宅，房屋數橡，生活窮苦，且每個人都烟油滿面，有麵館數間，麵味惡不能入口，每碗五百文，楊家宅西去，雖經山谷，然路皆平坦，軍行疾駛，經隆德縣城外行，一路楊柳載道，「關城見柳條」之景如繪，此卽文襄　。　　夜宿靜寧。此處生活程度與平凉相差不遠，城週五里，改建於淸順治，為間州之第二門戶，駐有軍旅月前曾為紅軍所據，但看不出有何破壞。　　十六日由靜寧出發，一路人家三五，經計家山後，車行極速，且路凹凸不平，旅客大受顚沛之苦。過見識坡登華家嶺，車隨山勢疾馳，一時卅分抵華家嶺車站，房屋十餘家，駐有一四零師。此處之麵，較楊家宅史難入口，西行全三時廿五分，始抵嶺下，長三百餘里之華家嶺，經三小時數十分始過。據旅客言，此嶺為盜　出沒之區，時有搶刦聞，今有軍隊駐此，稍為安全。夕陽滿山，寒風怒吼，車子于顛沛中跑進定西車部。站內附設旅館。距城東里餘，皆為妓女所佔，旅客反無慮可宿，乃往城內找尋，但無可找之店，只得廢然而出定西城。最後在車站南百步之遙覓得一民房，總算有處可宿。屋主非定西人。他是世居隴南，共有兄弟四人，一家十餘口，因旱災一家皆餓死，只剩他夫婦二人，行乞至此，積有小資租賈這間民房牛所。租給容商寄宿，除外做　頭售賣，入息尚堪溫飽。其說及災况。不忍入耳。當有人餓死，則皆爭食死者之肉以充飢，他也啖過其兄弟之肉，想人閱悲劇莫有甚於此者。　　定西水質極鹹，宛如鑒水，生活程度以車站所見而論，定西為西蘭路最高的。　　次晨，寒風凜冽，華氏表降至二十度，幸陽光東照，稍減寒氣。在站內看見許多外國男女傳敎士，使余與無限感想；他們為何走進文化落後的西北　為何居住地高苦寒的西北？　【未完】—船務特訊—　　泰生公司之交通號、自入塢修理以還、經及半月、現據該公司消息、將于此三數日間、該輪實能出塢、繼續航行云、　　渣甸輸船公司之明生（卽原日招商尙之海利）、現尙在九龍船塢修理中、惟大致經吿完竣、是輪將於本月州日開行、前往上海、烟、台靑島等埠云、　　意國郵船之干德華地號、昨自歐洲經石叻首途釆港、定于今晨七時抵步、泊九龍倉橋、幷於是日上午十一時赴滬、　　渣華公司之德基寶號、昨自滬來港、今晨八時始可抵步、泊九龍船塢處、幷在該塢略事修理、裝於下月二日、始首途前赴小呂宋、西貢、暹羅、石叻、八打威及南菲洲各屬云、中國旅行社問答欄答李業華君　　（一）滇幣與港强之比率若何、答、滇幣與國幣之比為十與一、國幣與港幣之比隨時價漲落　　（二）攜帶現欵前往之最安全法、答、可隨身帶入、無限制、本社可代出匯信、上海商業儲蓄銀行可代出匯票、毋須匯費　　（三）由　明轉赴仰光之最便途徑、答、可取道滇緬公路、或可至越南境之河內、乘火車至西貢、改輪至星州及仰光　　（四）海防有船直達仰坡光否、答、須由星加坡轉廣西省公路（六）  潘泰封　　及其沿綫景物　　風景　稱新八景、即江泛棹（城西南）趣園尋芳、（商埠三馬路後花木甚多）望仙瞰　、（城北三里）馬退遠眺、（城北六里）羅峯曉霞（城東北二十里）津頭觀釣、（城南四里）　象嶺烟嵐、（城西南十里）崑崙攬勝、（城東北八十里）此外東南二十里之靑山、亦具八景、卽泰靑遠眺、滄秀觀瀾、山旁夜月、沙浦漁燈、夕陽塔影、（龍象塔）子夜秋風、江帆破浪、凉閣聽泉、　　由邕　出發之公路、大抵含有國防上之　、計有　鬱、邕柳、邕龍、邕色四綫、另自龍州出發者、有龍凉、龍水二綫、吳墟（邕稱南廿八公里、為邕龍綫之一站（出發為吳東綫、　　一，邕鬱綫　自　寧東北行經二塘、四塘、　　、大陸、八塘、馬嶺、思隴、太守、丁橋、蘆墟十沽而至賓陽、凡九十一公里、係沙石路面、賓陽以西、與柳鬱綫合、迄鬱林止、全綫計長二百六十三公里、　賓段于民國十年開築、至十六年六月始工竣通車、沿綫峯巒起伏、山徑迂迴、最大坡度達百分之十二、　道最小牛徑為四十公尺、蘆圩之東、地名崑崙關、為宋狄靑大破儂智高處、今關址猶存、卽上述邕寧八景中之崑崙攪勝者是，　　二、柳邕綫、見乙節、　　3.邕龍綫自邕寧西南行、經吳墟、蘇墟、山墟、綏邕、西長、　　、板利、北　、明江、寧明、下石、那堪十二站、凡二百九十四公里、民國二十年完成、一十一年加舖砂石路面、二十三年從事木面橋涵之改善、故全綫工程、大體尙稱完善、惟自寧明至龍州六十三公里間、山坡上下、灣道最小半徑僅為十公尺、行車之難可以想見、而離龍州二十公里間、右為吉松河、左為山岩，一不經心、便生意外、行旅視為畏途、　　本綫斜亘廣西南部、沿途民居稀少、本無經濟價值之可言、惟近頃運貨轉道、由海防轉口之貨、亦有經河內裝火車越鎭南關由本綫內遝者、以言國訪、則龍州為南邊門戶、微此綫、則勢必與內地隔絕、一旦有事、將感鞭長莫及之患矣、　　龍州位龍江上流、高平吉松二江合流處、以光緒十二年、中法境界條約附約闢為商埠、附近人煙稀少、物產不豐、僅八角油茶油等、稍有出產、故貿易夙未見盛、據二十年龍州關報吿、是年進出口貿易、僅值二十三萬零二千餘元、近五年間、省政當局、力加建設，市政方面、已大非昔比、馬路雖狹、顧極整潔、江北岸為市街及縣城、南岸則各機關所在地、中質鐵橋、長二百卅尺、寬十尺、無支柱、為新式橋樑中之別具一格者、氣候炎熱、民國二十三年全年平均溫度攝氏二十二度七、夏時多瘴癘、全年最溫適之時、祇十一十二十三個月而已、名勝方面、沿江有中山公圍、漢伏波將軍馬援營壘之遺址也、廣二十餘畝、民國十二年闢　桑園、周植以竹、二十五年始改公園、今園內樓台亭榭、、風景宜人、沿河、有伏波廟、祀歷代英雄馬伏波、龍元洞在小連城山、離西岸十里、洞內保元宮、為中法戰役中大敗法軍之民族英雄蘇元春氏所建、廳事莊嚴富麗、有殿曰靈霄、供玉帝像、上有空隙、陽光自上斜貫而下、較靈隱寺側之堂線天、尤為名符其實、山項砲台雄立、氣象萬千、亦蘇氏經邊之遺跡、仙岩在東二里、山不甚高、下有深約二丈之石洞、中列石凳石桌、可以憩息、壁際多石刻、洞口一小石山挺立若屏、岩上有亭、曰得月、攀臨其上、四顧河山、輒生凌雲之志、　　四、邕色綫自邕寧北上經二塘、腰塘、三塘、大高峯、果花墟、騰翔、廿四亭、雙橋八站至武鳴、折向西北經里建、鑼墟、英墟、靈馬、四塘、歸德六站而迄果德、再沿右江西行經帶墟、鎭如、山心、思林、坡降、平馬、舊州、州景、那歌、那必十站而至百色、計程二百六十二公里、全線橋樑六十三度、水久式者五〇、涵洞六八三度、永久式六七六、最大坡度為百分之十二、灣道最小半徑為十二公尺、分三段築成、邕武段建築最早、全程四十二公里、當民國四年間、已由當時將軍署派工兵興築、民五以軍事關係、暫停、其後繼續展築，至民八始完成通車、全段十之七八、行山谷中、曲折多而灣度小、起伏頻而坡度急、高低靡定、年必侵次數次、而斜坡崩塌、更時有所開、武平段由武鳴至平馬、長一百五十三公里、二十三年始測、翌年十一月完成、自平馬至百色為平百段、七十年築、工竣未　、卽遭衝毀、二十二年從事修築、加舖砂石、路面工程、因以改善　　本綫聯絡廣西西部都邑、為桂西一大幹綫、沿綫農產、如黃豆、花生油，花生麵、烟叶、棉花均有出產、貨運方面、可以補右江水運之不足、此外對文化之推動、政令之傳佈、亦具英大之價　值焉、　　武鳴在邕寧北四十二公里、城跨鬱江支流西溪之上、附近地廣人稀、產烟葉頗著名，年值一一百萬圓、其次為西瓜、以色質鮮明、味淸甜、名聞遐邇、貿易方面、以有水運之便、亦稱繁盛、城東大明山麓，有金砂鑛多處、現僅土法開採、城內屋宇多圯廢、蓋自民國十年遭兵燹後、迄未恢復也、上將第為陸榮廷舊居、另有上將台、上刻徐世昌贈陸壽言「康强納祐錫福間閻」八字、附近獨秀峯麓、有明代舊府治、據身其間、四面絕壁、上午有瘴霧、人不能居、城南靈犀水、又名靈漲、水自石隙出、注成小湖、再流入江、湖水澄澈見底、遊魚可數、怪石錯綜、曳紅拖綠、日光簿射、五色晶瑩、觀魚台臨流而建、『觀魚」二字為李品仙所題、其上有台、題曰『一靈台」、并冠以序曰、「民所經營魚同樂、江湖相志心不躍、」江亢虎所手書也、過靈源、起鳳山孤峯峙立、風景頗佳、由山麓上、先經鎭江岩、繼入筱風洞、內供大士像、塑工精巧、離洞前進、為明黃錫兗讀書　、壁際多石刻、再上為太極洞、洞頂石紋、成太極圖形、維妙維肖、異觀也、　　百色為桂西政治中心、地當澄碧水右江交匯點、右江上越省境通滇東之富州西林等地、下接鬱江以達梧粵、故往昔水道運輸、吐納頻繁、雲南之麝香，毛皮、藥材等、莫不由此東下而滇西所需之石油、火柴，毛織品等、亦皆取給於此、本地產品則以茶油、八角油蘭油為大宗、　　五、龍南線以邕龍線之那堪為起點、南伸經憑祥、隘口二站而至鎮南關、為程二十五公里、（加那堪至龍州三十公里、計全長五十五公里）、橋樑十一度、涵洞二二七度、均為永久式、最大坡度為白分之十、灣道最小半徑為十公尺、此線為桂越交通要道、興築之始、猶遠在淸季、惟工程潦。、不過粗具規模、至民國十一年、二十年、先後大修、始行改善、　　【未完】經濟欄外匯掛牌回漲申匯無變　英美匯市仍靜　申匯先鬆後緊　　英匯：開倉後、賣家本月期為一〇二·九六八五、三月至四月期為一〇二·九三七五、五月至六月期為一〇二·九〇六二五、買家本月期為一〇三、二月至三月期為一〇二·九六八七五、四月至五月期為一〇二·九三七五、六七五，六月至七月期為一〇二·九〇六二五，市况小靜、　　美匯、開倉後、賣家本月至二月期為二九·一二五、三月期為二九·〇六二五、四月期為二九·〇〇、買家本月期為二九·一八七五、二月至三月期為二九·一二五、四月期為二九·〇六二五、五月期為二九·〇〇、市况先靜後小、中南入美匯七萬元、價為二九·一八七五（本月期）、匯豐入美匯四萬元、價二九·一八七五、華僑入美

<p>自由談抗戰親報價階段底作家任務  杜埃　　一　目前形勢的特點　　抗戰已發展到一新的階段，在這個新階段上文化運動的任務，是更其艱巨而偉大了。抗戰文藝運動，是整個文化戰綫中的一個重要的組織部份。它之更須要站在抗戰新階段上，加强其工作實踐，擴大其工作範圍，是絲毫沒有疑義的。　　但是，一個文化工作者，特別是一個文藝邋動的戰鬥士，在他從事於新階段的更緊張更嚴重的工作之前，不能不要先認識抗戰新階段的一般形勢和它的特點。只有深切的理解抗戰新階段底現實的複雜的內容，及其發展的基本的趨向，文藝工作者的筆，才更能起其批判的指示的推動的作用。　　二　抗戰進步方面　　然而，什麼是抗戰新階段的特點呢？這主要的是表現在兩方面。在進步的方面說，我們總結了十八個月來的抗戰，使我們更進一步的相信了抗戰並沒有使「眞理』銹色。相反的，抗戰使眞理的光芒，愈益有力的放射出來。今天抗戰之愈益堅持，政治上之愈益進步，是更進一步的封閉了悲觀主義者的「老是顫慄着』的嘴唇；同時　揭開了「用機械的觀點來察看現實」的先生們的盲眼。中共六全會議的召開，國際援助的增加，叛徒汪精衛之被淸除，國民黨五中全曾的舉行，使抗戰有了一個新開展。它使國內『落伍』的部份更有可能地，成「進步」的東西。而這新形勢就更有力地推動着全民族的統一戰綫，向更高明的階段逐漸發展，使懷疑持久抗戰，懷疑統一戰綫的「憂國之士」，不能不要來個重新的認識。這是偉大現實的一面（。主要的基本的富有决定作用的一面。）　　三叛徒的陰謀　　表現在另一方面的特點是，目前新的進步形勢，也可以使到落後的部份，更趨於保守；特別是日本帝國主義及我們內底和平妥協的腐化份子，要忌怕這種進步。因此，他們要唆使漢奸托派等盡力的進行挑撥離間，阻碍我們的進步，破壞我們的抗戰。這估計在目前已不是「可能與不可』的問題，而是在成為鐵一般的事實表現出來了。×人在此地的機關報。和叛徒們在此地的機關報、每天都在一唱一和的肆行其挑撥離間，造謠中　的無恥把戲。所以，目前整個抗戰雖更奔向進步之途，但也就不能不更要我們提高警惕性。由於這種現實激變的復雜內容，我們得出如下的結論：叛徒的分裂運動，不能把它當作是運動的結束，相反的，這是分裂運動的開始。分裂運動之所以還沒有結束，投降妥協的陰謀之所以還沒有結求，這是因為叛徒們的野心，還沒有停止。而且目前又是是×人發動其對西北西南大規模的軍略進攻的時候，則叛徒們的『無畏』行動之敢於在全國痛擊之下繼續進行，不是無因的了。　　四　現實主義綱領的兩個要點　　上述各點，是抗戰新階段的一般形勢和特點。但是，在這些形勢和持點之下，翁們可以得出如下的結論：即目　的現實本身是包含着兩種相反的因素在發展。政治上的新形勢，民族革命戰爭的新發展，民族統一戰綫的新發展，雖在加强其遠度而提　其程度，但它還遭過着許多困難（×人的新進攻，親日漢奸的活動）。但同樣我們要在這個現實的特點裏面，明確的指出；今天我們各方面的進步，是一年半抗戰的收獲，是民族歷史發展的儼然的成果。它雖在運動的進程中繼續發現其新的困難，但也繼續增長其新的力量，這種新力量必可以衝破一切，克服一切而無間斷地前進的。因此，目前的新形勢在基本上，它必然再向更高的階段繼續發展的。然而，這種有利的發展，却不能或缺地須要如下的堅實保証：卽加强每一個的工作實踐。　　文藝界的戰士們，在今天的新階段上，應特別注意所謂「現實主義綱領」裏的兩要點，即文藝工作者應當和新哄段的抗戰實踐，更緊實地結合起來。從這一個前提之下，從這一個觀點之下，去「描寫現實發展底眞實的姿態」。所謂「姿態」應明確地看作是生動的，正在前進着的現實發展的總的「傾向」。其次是，作家應緊緊的站在科學的世界觀上面，向唯物辯証法加緊學習，不把唯物辯證法當作是現成的法典，是死的敎條，是呆板的公式；而是把唯物辯証法，當作是活的東西，它的原則靈活地運用到具體的活生生的事實上來，提高作家對問題的理處能力，和對現實的更明澈的透視。行軍瑣記  李輝英　　「不成就去打官司，難道還怕他不成—一一個小個子，三尖眼，鼻子下面隆起一個肉瘤，揮動着拳頭大聲喊着，彷拂他是個天不怕地不怕的央雄。　　「那可不，黃崗縣里里外外怕過誰—打起官司還有他的便宜—見鬼—」這人是個身體魁梧的汁子，胳膊粗力氣大，一伸手就可以打翻三個四　的角色。　　這中間却又有一個比較斯文一點的，手擊着旱煙管，不慌不忙壓伏着別人：　　「莫慌，莫慌，有話慢說，沒有辦不了的事情。能够自，，總以自了為妙。」　　然而那另一邊的也不服氣，激憤的話像彈子一般從彈弓中彈出來：　　「打自司？打呀！誰怕誰？別拿大話來嚇人！」　　一夥人氣勢汹汹的，看樣子一時之關還不會有個完結。　　到這時，我和高的疑團消解解了，我們猜知他們的歷來，也就把自已緊張的心情壓下去。在　村，那萬惡的勢力，依然存在着，地痞流氓，他們到處橫行，他們正依此為生，依此起家。他們可以挑撥是非，可以抱打不平，而最後的結果，文明一點，從中漁利，野蠻一點實行敲詐，眼前這一羣，正是包雜萬有，橫行鄕村的壞蛋。　（未完）記幾個憲兵  的堅　　南京撤退時，在徐州想趁上　海路的車子，眞是千難萬難，車頂，窗口，扶梯，連詹氏　鈎上都坐滿了難民，月台上等着上車的，還是黑壓壓的站滿了，有的怕已經買了車票，等了好多天了。　　特別快車擠不上，難民車更擠不上，在無可奈何裏，我看刦車站外有輛還沒掛上的車廂，抱了姑且去看看的嘗試念頭，便沿着鐵軌走去等到我走近可以看到車廂上的粉筆字時，我又懊悔多走這一次了，怪不得沒人擠到這兒來，原來是憲兵專車啊。　　我帶了孩于預備走囘去，這時車窗拍答一響，一個戴着銅盔的頭探了出來。　　『幹嗎？』　　『不，我來看看是否空車廂的。等車子等了好多天了，老是擠不上去』，說了我就想走開：　　『上那兒去的？』另一個鐵銅盔的頭，又探了出來問。　　『是南京來的，想上漢口去』我忽然想起，他們不會疑心我是什麼漢奸×棵，來探他們行蹤的罷，這個想頭逼我快些離開車廂。　　『就是你捫這四個人嗎？』　　『是的，還有兩件行李。』　　『好，等我給你們問問長官去』。　　我不能走開開，可是我站在那兒等了幾分鐘，是的確不大好過的。「問長官去』是什麼意思呢？我極度的不安。沒多久，去問的憲兵，又探出頭來了，問：　　『你是幹什麼的』？　　『以前在報館裏做事，近年來則在××敎書，這次是從家鄉逃出來的。』　　『好，去搬了行李來，我們也　上漢口去的』，有好多個人開了門招呼，有兩個憲兵跳下來，立刻把我的孩子抱上車去了。　　等我搬了行李，送上憲兵專車時，我的兩個孩子，已經成了憲兵歡樂的中心了，他們搶着抱，搶着吻孩子紅潤的面頰，用許多糖菓逗孩子笑。　　脫去了鋼盔以後，我才看出他們全是廿多歲的靑年，有個我看還不滿十八歲呢，活潑，天眞，有時還孩子氣，和全副武裝時渾身精明强悍的氣概，完全兩樣了。　　對他們的疑惑，不安，消失了—慢慢的。我和他們談得投機起來，慢慢的，我聽了他們的遭遇，經驗，觀念，我又不禁衷心欽佩他們　　是的，依着死的認識，年齡，我或許可以做他們的老大哥，可是另一方面，活的學問歷經，他們處處都可以做我的老師。　　好幾仙月戰場上的洗煉，把他們鍛鍊得純鋼似的，苦難祇有使他們堅强，不斷的死的威脅，祇有使他們更加純潔，更加努力。　　『每一秒鐘，每一個地方，都有死的威脅，你運氣好，便凑巧避過了那秒鐘子彈穿過的那一個的地方，要是碰上了，沒得說的，命該如此，為了不知在那一秒鐘死去，所以恨不得一點鐘內能够做人家一年的工作，時間的寶責，名利的無用，怕祇有在戰場上的人，識得最透澈！』　　這幾句話是一個姓劉的憲兵吿訴我的。　　『窮人同情窮人，那是很有道理的。沒有上戰塲的經驗，是不會十分知道前綫的兵士，是怎樣的痛苦和英勇的，我們起初在滬戰時候。在眞茹一帶協助佈防，後來又移近火綫　里，不說旁的，那時候運吃住都沒有，或是有了飯沒有功夫吃，或是想吃而伙夫不能送來，白天要打仗不能睡，夜裏要防×人偷襲，不敢也不能熟睡，等到我們調到後方來休息時，我們還不時的從睡夢跳起來，找槍衛出屋子去呢，所以從那次戰場上囘來以後，我們欽佩着每個乒士。講老實話，能够做現在的中國兵，眞是可以值得驕傲的。」　　姓籃的四川人在第二天吿訴我，他的眉毛禁不住歡喜的直是掀動。　　到鄭州時，他們吿訴我，破獲×人間諜機關的就是他們，他們為了這次辛勞，連帶的愛上了鄭州，愛上了鄭州的焦棗，他們說全國聞名的，要我買兩元錢送給親友，我照辦了，他們的話沒錯，焦　很好吃，所以將近漢口時，幾乎給我們吃完了，不，應該是有一斤兩斤留下的，想到實在太少了，所以索性吃掉了。　　近到大智門車站時，他們在我的日記簿上簽了姓名，作這一次　水相逢的紀念　　當我向他們這別，說着『再會』時，有一個半開玩笑的和我說：　　「不是戰塲上，便是地獄裏，不然是不會相會的了。」水滸與民族革命  鄒嘯　　——民族小說話　　水滸傳與民埃革命有很密切的關係，約舉起來，有下列五點；　　第一，是晚宋襲聖與的水滸人物像贊。高如李嵩羣了像，他就寫像贊。聖與是明季程敏政（宋遺民錄）中的人物；他這樣地稱許水滸英雄，可見他是怎樣熱烈地希望有草澤央雄起而恢復宋室，把元人逐出漢域了。　　第二，是元朝羅貫中的水滸多合史實。如董平，是楚南的强盜。如關勝曾屢拒金兵，見宋史和金史的劉豫傳。又有大刀魏勝在紹興三十一年率領山東的思義軍，與金人作戰，見宋史卷三六八，如張順張貴可相當於浪裏白條張顧和船火兒張橫。水滸有一囘，湧金門張順歸神。在宋史上，張頭確楚死在江中的，不過是長江，不是之江，而所紙抗的却是元朝的降將呂文煥。如河北王友直疑卽玉麒麟　俊義的彩子，他們倆部是住在大名府的，並且，主友直所統領的忠義軍是最大的一股，計兵數萬，友直又是朝廷方面的統制，與普通强盜不同，所以水滸傳列他于第二位，以示尊敬，（以上論証引用逸經第一期謝興堯水滸傳人物考）這情形與現在各地興起游擊隊頗為相似，羅貫中親受元代統治下的痛苦，大約也不無有感吧？　　第三是明代嘉靖間郭動府的本子加入征遼一事。這是頗有深意的。當時有俺答屢次入寇，南有倭賊時常騷擾，郭動府中人頗想有像水滸一樣的英雄去防禦外侮，所以纔加入征遼一事，以思古人。　　第四是明末張岱（陶庵夢憶）想要換回明代的傾頹。他稱讚梁山的的人物「英雄忠義之氣，積於筆　間，」可見他是怎樣嚮往於這些抗戰的志士，希望晚明也有這樣人來和滿淸抗戰了。　　第五是淸季天地會的利用水滸傳。天地會卽以天為父以地為母之意，由於引用水滸『指天地作父母』而來。四海一家，與後來賽珍珠（PearlBuck）譯水滸為All　AreBrothers暗合。因此，康熙現例中有「禁拜兄弟」條。後來天地會（即三合會或紅帮）加入孫中山的興中會，對於推翻滿淸這一業績上盡了不少的力。　　以上五點就是水滸與民族革命的關係。我們現在也應該讀水滸傳，各地民衆都起來作自衛戰和游擊戰。街頭小景  任鈞　　叮噹—可噹！——　　一　簇新的『老爺車』衛了過來。　　車夫十分機警而且有訓練：　　『老爺，糟糕，前面又是献金台』！　　又是献金台？——　　老爺想：『今天眞倒霧』—　　『那麼，還是讓我下去吧，　　不要又給那些勸募員似園起來』！　　於是，老爺祇好挺着大肚皮，　　暫時跟車子離開。　　叮噹！可噹！現在老爺又坐上了車子，　　已經累得滿頭大汗，　　氣也喘不過來。　　叮噹！可噹！他想：『總算又過了』　山　　可不是—省綫便是發財』。</p>

<h3>Basic Arguments for Chairman Chiang's Belief in Inevitable Victory in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>In his opening address to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee, Chairman Chiang meticulously analyzed the situation of the enemy and ourselves, indicating the reasons for our country's inevitable victory in the War of Resistance, and the concrete measures to strive to ensure the conditions for inevitable victory. This is the supreme guideline for our 450 million compatriots in the War of Resistance and the struggle for survival, and a golden rule that all Chinese citizens should carefully read and follow. The full text is about ten thousand words long, and its content can be divided into two major parts. The first half can be said to be the basic arguments for the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance, while the second half is the concrete measures to strive for victory in the War of Resistance. Now, I will briefly elaborate on the points indicated, to fulfill the responsibility of conveying the leader's guidelines to the journalistic circles. Due to space limitations, I will briefly express my views in two parts. First, let's start with the basic arguments for the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance:</p>
<p>(1) The determination to resist and the confidence in inevitable victory are the fundamental driving forces for us to win the final victory in the all-out War of Resistance. Without this determination and confidence, not only will our victory not be guaranteed, but even the War of Resistance will not be able to continue. Our ability, as a long-weak and aging country, to resist a country with relatively modern and mechanized military equipment for as long as eighteen months, and to become stronger as we fight, all stems from this confidence and determination. High self-confidence generates resolute action. In our "confidence," there is also "shared confidence" and "mutual trust." At this critical moment for our entire survival, our 450 million people have a common belief, which is that if we do not resist to the end to strive for final victory and national liberation, we will become slaves of foreign races and never have a chance to rise again. In addition to this shared confidence, the relationship of "mutual trust" is also very important. The ability of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as all parties and factions, to eliminate past grudges and prejudices and genuinely cooperate to resist external oppression, stems from this mutual trust. Shared confidence generates mutual trust, and with these two types of confidence, there is the determination to jointly resist to the end. Therefore, how to find ways to increase the sincerity of "mutual trust" and enhance the conviction of "shared confidence" thereafter is the first major prerequisite for strengthening the basic driving force of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(2) Our confidence and determination to resist to the end do not come out of thin air, but are based on scientific evidence. This scientific evidence is the objective understanding and correct judgment of the situation of both the enemy and ourselves, as well as the international situation. Ancient military strategists said: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." The reason why the enemy is now trapped in a dilemma, and fights in confusion, is precisely because they do not know themselves and know their enemy, that is, their understanding and judgment of the objective situation is incorrect. In the first phase of the War of Resistance, there were also some unscrupulous elements who did not have confidence and determination in the War of Resistance, and were always in a state of wavering, which had a negative impact on our all-out War of Resistance. The reason for this was that they did not recognize the reasons for the enemy's inevitable defeat, or overestimated the enemy's strength, or made a separate and individual assessment of the Sino-Japanese War, and deviated from the relationship with the world. The enemy will inevitably be defeated and perish because we resist to the end, but the many international problems caused by our resistance to the end are also major factors accelerating the enemy's demise; we will inevitably win because of our heroic resistance, but the sympathy and support we have gained from various countries for defending international conventions and world justice through our heroic resistance is also a huge force to enhance our victory. Therefore, correctly recognizing the enemy and the inevitable trend of the world is the scientific basis for maintaining and strengthening our confidence and determination in the War of Resistance. We should thereafter more actively promote the study of the enemy's situation in all aspects and the inevitable trend of international mutual constraints. With this active research and the correct understanding obtained from it, we can not only enhance our confidence and determination in the War of Resistance, but also obtain a basis for establishing the political and military strategies of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(3) Chairman Chiang put forward the argument that the enemy is bound to be defeated and listed many facts as supporting evidence, which is precise and accurate: First, the enemy's invasion war violates the steps of its continental policy; second, the enemy's understanding of our country and the world is incorrect; third, it violates three military principles and commits three military taboos; fourth, its political strategies adopted towards our country and various countries in the world are wrong; fifth, the enemy completely ignores the great strength of our nation and the fierce trend of the times. In short, the mad enemy not only failed to recognize its opponent clearly, but also failed to recognize the nature of the times. Evaluating the new China of the 20th century with the perspective of the Yuan and Qing dynasties is its biggest fatal wound. The enemy has committed the above-mentioned errors, which means that it has created deep weaknesses in the war. In the process of promoting the War of Resistance, we must closely grasp these weaknesses and expand and deepen them, so as to hasten the arrival of the enemy's defeat. For example, on our side, we should expand the propaganda of the War of Resistance and strengthen our strength in the War of Resistance; in the diplomatic field, we should closely and effectively connect with our allied countries to create a great force to resist the world's aggressive groups. This can not only increase our strength, but also isolate the enemy and its accomplices. In this era, there are few countries that are warmongering, aggressive, and reckless, and there are always many more countries that love true peace and uphold justice, that is to say, the strength of the latter is always much greater than that of the former. Therefore, if we effectively connect with truly peace-loving countries and urge them to fully express their great potential and closely link them together, the aggressors will be completely isolated and their power weakened. However, the initiation and connection of this kind of true peaceful force should have different priorities and distinctions in its methods, and must first start with the countries that love peace most deeply and uphold justice most actively, and then proceed in order. As for the standard for judging the degree of love of peace and upholding justice, it is not difficult, and can be determined by the degree of closeness of the relationship between each country and our country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions said: "Unite with all ethnic groups who treat us equally and struggle together," which indicates the best guideline for determining the order of priority and intimacy.</p>
<p>(4) However, among the basic arguments for Chairman Chiang's belief in the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance, the most important is how to ensure the basic conditions for the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance. What exactly is this basic condition? There is nothing else, that is, "do not give the enemy any opportunity to exploit," in other words, we must not waver in our will, we must not willingly surrender, and we must not seek compromise halfway. The ultimate goal of our all-out War of Resistance is not to seek temporary peace or a compromise solution, but to complete the national revolution and establish a new China with equality and freedom, so we must seek a fundamental solution and strive for final victory. Judging from the current situation, if Japanese imperialism exists, the disaster of the Chinese nation cannot be eliminated. It has reached the stage of either the enemy or us. The enemy is already full of sores and diseases that have penetrated deep into the bone marrow. It is urgently trying to find ways to get rid of its irremediable predicament and remedy its irreparable weaknesses. We must hold on to this critical moment and push it onto the road to defeat and demise. As Chairman Chiang indicated: "If we can persist in the War of Resistance, we will surely achieve victory. If we cannot resist resolutely and compromise with the enemy, and conclude any peace treaty, then the enemy can, based on the position it enjoys in the treaty of surrender, endlessly penetrate deeper. When it comes to this point... all of China, no matter where, no matter who, will be subject to the enemy's domination and trampling, and there will be no reason to expect to be spared... This is no different from sacrificing the future lives of our Chinese descendants for generations to come, and instead delaying the enemy's demise." How we should grit our teeth on this difficult step, grasp this basic condition, and ensure the arrival of the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance is the most important issue at present.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee Full Text of President Chiang's Address (Continued from yesterday's Third Edition)</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese government and its Prime Minister Konoe have successively issued statements, this conspiracy to swallow China in order to dominate the Pacific and invade the world is known to all, and need not be repeated. What I want to make clear to all comrades now is that Japan has already failed, and there are various reasons to prove that it will eventually suffer the greatest defeat. As long as we continue to fight, we have the certainty of victory. First, let's look at the Japanese side. Not to mention that in the past eighteen months, they have suffered more than 700,000 casualties in the north and south battlefields of China, and spent 900 million yuan in war expenses, leading to exhaustion of resources in their country, stagnation of agriculture and industry, social degradation, and political unrest. These are all tangible signs. Even judging from their launch of the invasion to the present, the application of all their military and political strategies, as well as their observations and estimates of China and their understanding of the times, they have actually violated principles and fallen into errors at every step. At this juncture of success or failure, gain or loss, survival or extinction, I want to list the examples of Japan's inevitable failure for the plenary session based on genuine facts, and present a detailed analysis report to all comrades.</p>
<p>First, everyone knows that Japan launched this invasion to implement its continental policy. According to their internally determined secret traditional policy and their publicly announced Tanaka Memorial, they must first occupy Manchuria and Mongolia, and then attempt to invade the entire China, and even dominate Asia and unify the globe. However, before they had stabilized their occupation of Northeast China, they wanted to invade North China. After their power reached North China, they changed from gradual erosion to rapid annexation, and then openly occupied our Beiping and Tianjin. This is already completely contrary to their established national policy and strategy of the so-called continental policy. Not only that, but they also want to advance to Central China and even invade Guangzhou. This is a further step for them to destroy their own traditional policy. After entering Central and Southern China, they not only fell into a strategically untenable position, but also, politically, forced them to face the world powers and put Japan in a desperate situation on all sides. This is the first reason for their inevitable defeat.</p>
<p>Second, their initial attempt to subdue us without a fight, but we finally fought without surrendering, which has already exceeded their expectations. After the war began, they wanted a quick victory, but from Shanghai, Songhu, Zhekou, Nanjing, all the way to the battle of southern Shandong, as well as the battles around Poyang Lake and the Dabie Mountains, they went deeper and deeper, and finally failed to achieve a quick victory. Then they turned around and longed for a quick peace. Before we withdrew from Wuhan, their magazines and newspapers tried their best to advocate the cessation of hostilities or to find ways to stop the war, while using various cunning schemes to try to lure us into the trap, deceive the world, and gain advantages. But soon, they revealed their true intentions and took out their so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which was eventually deceived and subdued by Japan, and was not the destruction of our entire nation. Now the Japanese are妄想妄想under the slogan of "establishing a new order in East Asia," to realize their dream of統制 of China in the short term. They never want to think that they have invaded our Northeast, spent more than forty years of time, (Turn to the third edition)</p>
<h3>Growing Up in the Storm</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Lin Heng</p>
<p>Special Feature on the Establishment of the Huiyang County Team Department of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers</p>
<p>"The expression of work," the spirit of struggle, naturally people will recognize it. The youth of Huizhou are highly hoping that you will continue the organization of the Huiyang Anti-Japanese Pioneers!</p>
<p>"...</p>
<p>"Finally, please forgive me for not signing my name here—let's talk again. With best regards! And respect to the comrades of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers!"</p>
<p>After reading the letter, the meeting place was so quiet that only people's urgent breathing could be heard. It was clear that they were indignant and wanted to hate. "Comrades of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers, unite, carry forward the spirit of friendship of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers, and the style of hard struggle..." Everyone shouted with He Jun, and this slogan was very effective. Everyone's face showed an expression of energy, and some people began to smile.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>In the lively, united, tense, and joyful today, they remember the small waves of yesterday.</p>
<p>After several days of regular symposiums, a total of forty-two young people participated in the symposium and all joined the Huiyang County Team Department of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team. On the day before the opening of the establishment meeting, they were still discussing political philosophy issues. Suddenly, someone suggested that the youth of Huiyang should establish another organization instead of joining the Anti-Japanese Pioneers. Then many people echoed, and you came with a few sentences and I said a few words, and the order of the meeting was chaotic. After a while, someone suggested canceling the Huiyang County Team Department of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers and establishing the Huiyang Youth Anti-Japanese Federation. It was very obvious that anyone could see that someone was sabotaging the arrangement.</p>
<p>The meeting was chaotic and debated for half an hour. The搗搗份子充分demonstrated shamelessness. Yesterday they were still shouting "We want to fight for the Anti-Japanese Pioneers to the end" "Consolidate and expand the organization of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers" but today they are destroying it with a cold and sarcastic attitude.</p>
<p>Just when the trouble was at its most important, their district team leader Lin Deputy Team Leader appeared next to the long table in the hall. Mr. Lin stood, and immediately all the people's eyes were concentrated on his face.</p>
<p>"Comrades," Mr. Lin began to speak, "The occurrence of this matter today, it is very obvious that we can see that someone is arranging to destroy the organization of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers Huiyang County Team Department, which we expected in advance." He explained for a while and then went on to say: "Okay! Since someone has forgotten that they were still shouting "We want to fight for the expansion and consolidation of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers" yesterday, then let him deceive himself. Let's give him a chance and allow them to sign up to withdraw from the Anti-Japanese Pioneers immediately..."</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the meeting became more tense. Those who wanted to withdraw from the Anti-Japanese Pioneers stood up and signed up one after another. Some explained that their family environment did not allow them to temporarily join the Anti-Japanese Pioneers, and at the same time, a woman requested to participate in the Anti-Japanese Pioneers team.</p>
<p>"...The Anti-Japanese Pioneers cadre training class will continue as usual. We welcome comrades who are not Anti-Japanese Pioneers to attend the lectures... For comrades who are forced to withdraw from the Anti-Japanese Pioneers due to environmental reasons, we hope that they will participate in the Anti-Japanese Pioneers only after overcoming their difficulties... Now the meeting is adjourned, but please stay, comrades of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers." Mr. Lin made such an announcement to them again. Twelve people left the meeting place, and as soon as they stepped out of the library, a mastermind was blaming the others, saying: "Why didn't you arrange for everyone to withdraw?"</p>
<p>The meeting place upstairs was焕然一新了. There was no more chaos. They started a new symposium. First, they analyzed the cause of today's microwave and its possible impact. According to a report from one of the young people, this morning the Huiyang Youth convened a symposium at No. 1 Middle School in the county. Someone in the meeting threatened them, saying that joining the Anti-Japanese Pioneers would be transferred and sent away from their hometowns at any time, saying that local people should not be led by provincial youth, and some people said bad things about the Anti-Japanese Pioneers, and some people even went to the homes of new comrades to spread rumors, explaining the 활泼활泼 spirit of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers as romance, and told their parents not to let their children participate in the Anti-Japanese Pioneers team... This fact proves even more proves that someone is sabotaging the Anti-Japanese Pioneers. "The first basic condition for a member of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team is to have political firmness. Those wavering elements and opportunists who withdrew from the Anti-Japanese Pioneers today cannot stay in the ranks of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers for long. It is beneficial to the Anti-Japanese Pioneers that they withdraw today instead of in the future, making the Anti-Japanese Pioneers more pure." The chairman's conclusion ended the analysis of the microwave. Finally, they discussed the future training and work issues. Ms. Gao suggested increasing the training time to "four hours a day." Mr. Li requested to increase the courses on mass movements, the Chinese revolution, and other courses. There is no doubt that the content of the training is more enriched, which means that "This newborn child has rich nourishment, and his future must be very bright." The reporter thought so.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>There were still twenty minutes before class time, and the team members were all there. Some sang "Fight to the Enemy's Rear," which they had just learned yesterday, and some sang "Sending Out the Brave Warriors Song" in a low voice. Liao Jun was so excited that he was not shy and opened his "bean paste throat" to sing his latest masterpiece - the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Song. Some team members were chatting and laughing coldly. The Three Two "bookworms" secretly took their books and newspapers and went to the room to eat their去了, and the work was disturbed, he had to stop writing and leave the articles and scripts of the new comrades for modification next time.</p>
<p>"It's time for class," the duty officer announced to everyone. In a short while, the team members sat down in rows, and the whole atmosphere changed. Taking out their notebooks, they recorded seriously and nervously, guerrilla tactics, protracted war, dialectics, summary of the anti-Japanese war in seventeen months, report on Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the nation... These new knowledge enhanced the learning interest of the youth of Huizhou, making each of them feel happy, living a life that has never been so rich.</p>
<p>They approved the seven candidate team members who recently joined the organization to become official team members. They also decided to improve the status of team members in the family, and all the members visited the home of each team member to商正在籌備成立的 青抗聯會, they passed the proposal not to hate but to actively support the establishment and consolidation of its organization, and finally decided to visit the authorities, who convened the Huiyang Youth Anti-Wang Support Fifth Plenary Session.</p>
<p>I remember that it was the two days when they set off to work in other counties. The time of departure had arrived, but the rain was still following the north wind, hitting the hats, faces, and clothes of the戰士們, and the accumulated water on the hats and险ไหลไหลล down from above again. Some people were shivering, but no one complained, and no one was willing to fall behind as a "turtle". Standing up straight, holding their breath, and singing the Guerrilla Song, they advanced one step and two steps. Suddenly, a part of the team stopped and waved to the soldiers who were continuing to walk, singing aloud: "Farewell comrades, farewell comrades, to Boluo, work actively and work hard, comrades, comrades,"</p>
<p>On the nineteenth day of the first month in Huizhou City</p>

<p>Original Text of President Chiang's Speech Continued from Second Page</p>
<p>[The enemy] has used a large amount of troops and spent a lot of money, but still cannot control our Northeast, let alone govern it. He still does not realize this obvious lesson, but instead wants to intensify his efforts to annex all of China, recklessly following the same path to failure. This is because he fundamentally does not understand our Chinese nation, does not understand the power of our Three Principles of the People, does not recognize the characteristics of our National Government, and does not recognize today's era, as well as the revolutionary strategy and tactics of China today. Frankly speaking, during Napoleon's invasion of Russia, the strategy and tactics of full-scale attack and protracted resistance had not yet been invented. Napoleon, with such great talent and such a large army, could not avoid defeat. How much more so today, when we are a republic, the national spirit is widespread, and the entire nation is united against the enemy. Under the command of the National Government, we are implementing modern revolutionary strategies and tactics. No military force can succeed by chance. Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" has the three major principles of "Knowing that the enemy cannot be attacked, knowing that our troops cannot be attacked, and knowing that the terrain cannot be fought." I would like to add a principle to Sun Tzu: "Knowing that the enemy can be attacked, knowing that our troops can be attacked, and knowing that the terrain can be attacked, but not knowing that the era cannot be attacked, then there is no way to win." The × people do not understand the situation of the other side, especially do not recognize the era, which is obvious without further explanation. Based on the five points mentioned above, it can be concluded that the × people are bound to fail. Now that × and I are in a stalemate, the situation of victory and defeat is different. The × people's inevitable defeat proves that I have a way to win. In terms of military affairs alone, during the first phase of the war, we fought in areas with convenient transportation. His army, navy, and air force, as well as mechanized units, could move in and out freely. Now, fighting in the war zone that we are violating, after eighteen months, he has not only failed to defeat us, but we have become more and more refined, stronger and stronger. In the second phase of the war, we entered battlefields with complex terrain, mountainous and boundless deserts, and extremely inconvenient transportation and supplies. His skills are, of course, even more difficult to use. Moreover, he has already used more than 85% of his national military force. Everyone knows that the × country's military equipment was originally prepared with 30% for use in China and the other 70% for use against Russia. Today, in our country, he has not only used more than twice the troops he had anticipated, but the number of casualties in China has reached more than 35% of his total military force. As for the detailed numbers of the × army, I will explain them in detail to all comrades when the military report is given. Everyone sees that the × army's use of troops and casualties have reached this level, which proves that his path to defeat has been determined. Moreover, if we compare the battlefields later, one of our bullets can be used as at least three bullets, and one of our soldiers can be used as at least three × soldiers. On the other hand, the × people are the opposite. From our experience in the past year and a half, the × people must use at least three people for one of our soldiers and three bullets for one of our bullets, and perhaps even more.</p>
<p>Therefore, today's problem is that as long as our country does not give × an opportunity to take advantage of, final victory is guaranteed. What is giving × an opportunity? If our spirit is threatened by him, our will is shaken, we willingly surrender, and we hastily seek compromise, that is what the × people desire most. Only in this way can the × people explain their irreparable predicament, make up for their irreparable weaknesses, and our country and nation will be forever mired in misery. In short, if we can persist in resistance, we will surely achieve victory. If we cannot resolutely resist and compromise with × and conclude some kind of peace treaty, then the × people can, based on their privileged position in the surrender treaty, continue to deepen their encroachment without limit. At this point, our China will stop breathing, block its ears and eyes, and endure all kinds of hardships and sacrifices under the smoke screen of the new terms created by the × country, such as the "New Order in East Asia," "Manchukuo-China cannot be separated," and "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere." All of China, regardless of location or person, will be subjected to the slaughter and trampling of the × people, with no hope of survival. Once the spirit is coerced, the situation will immediately change, and once the humiliating treaty is signed, the status of master and slave will be established, which is tantamount to sacrificing the future lives of our Chinese descendants for generations and delaying the demise of the × country.</p>
<p>After understanding the various examples I have listed above of the × people creating their own failures and committing their own sins, you comrades can know that if Japan can win this Sino-Japanese War, then all the world's strategies, tactics, and all military theories will have to be fundamentally overturned, and even the principles of all things can be proven useless. After understanding the meaning of the × people's various coercions and inducements to surrender today, you comrades can better understand what we should strive to uphold. To put it plainly, we must be determined and unyielding, that is to say, our spirit must never be coerced by the × people, and we must never be deceived by the × people. We must persist in the war of resistance to the end, not only preventing the × people's past goal of "quick war and quick victory" from being achieved, but also making their current cunning scheme of "quick settlement" fail completely. This is our only strategy today. This is the basis for the failure of the × people and the victory of our country. I solemnly tell you comrades that this is the conclusion I have reached after deeply considering the safety and security of the nation for eighteen months from the position of commander-in-chief entrusted with the heavy responsibility. I especially put it forward to contribute to all the comrades in our meeting.</p>
<p>You comrades should also make the compatriots throughout the country understand that we must take the history of the Song and Ming dynasties as a warning. We must know that the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was not due to the superior power of the × people and foreign races, but entirely due to the wavering and timidity of the will and spirit of a small number of generals and officials in the government at that time, as well as the social gentry, and even the people of the whole country, who were affected by them, leading to the collapse of the overall situation beyond repair. Today, we have such a good national spirit, such a deep revolutionary foundation, and the Three Principles of the People of our party, which are suitable for the times. As long as we do not abandon ourselves, no force can destroy our country. The situation today is very clearly placed before us, that is, the × people will inevitably become more ferocious and use their weapons and troops to make a desperate struggle. Our policy is very simple and clear. From the second Ming Resistance War, we must use our revolutionary strategy and tactics to fundamentally attack the wavering will and exhausted strength of the × people with a more courageous and resolute war of resistance to quickly promote the total collapse and final failure of the × people to complete the task of our revolution. I also tell our comrades that if we currently fantasize about compromise and hope for a lucky peace, we will only throw ourselves into the trap and bring about our own demise. It must be known that the so-called talks on adjusting national relations published by the former × Prime Minister Konoe on the 22nd of last month are actually documents of inducement to surrender and not conditions for peace talks. If we talk about peace based on this, frankly speaking, it is surrender. Our Chinese nation has ambition, integrity, and a future. Although the sacrifices have been great in the year and a half of the war of resistance, the strength is getting stronger and stronger. All of us descendants of the Yellow Emperor of the Chinese nation must be worthy of our ancestors and parents, worthy of future generations, worthy of ourselves, and worthy of the countless martyrs who sacrificed for the war of resistance. There is absolutely no one who is willing to surrender. Today, we only have to fight with all our strength and resist with the determination to die until the goal is achieved. We must know that surrender is seeking death in life, with no hope of survival. Fighting seeks life in death, and there is a way to survive.</p>
<p>Now, let me make a review of our own war of resistance in China.</p>
<p>I can say that not only do the × people have a way to fail, but our country has a way to win. Sun Tzu said, "First make yourself invincible, then wait for the enemy to be vincible." To achieve invincibility, of course, we must work hard and struggle with blood and sweat. But from the perspectives of history, geography, culture, economy, and national spirit, and from the past facts, our innate conditions really have a foundation that makes × inevitably invincible, as long as we cooperate with our man-made efforts. We can definitely defeat the × people without any doubt.</p>
<p>(A) Historically speaking, I have said that the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was the defeat of a dynasty of one family, not the demise of our Chinese nation. Our Chinese nation has never been subdued by anyone in the past five thousand years. Not only has it not been destroyed by anyone, but the collapse of the dynasties of the Song and Ming dynasties was only due to a very small number of generals and officials who had no courage or integrity, only knew how to live in ease and comfort for themselves, and were selfish and self-interested, regardless of the misfortunes of the nation, resulting in the collapse of the entire dynasty for hundreds of years. But at that time, it was an autocratic monarchy, and the court and the people were separated into two factions. The pain was not very concerned, and the people's resistance could not be exerted for a while. In fact, at that time, the firm national spirit was not controlled by foreign races and always resisted the foreign invaders to the end. After the nation was generally aware and strengthened, although two or three hundred years had passed, it was finally able to eliminate the barbarians and restore the country. What's more, now is the era of the Republic of China, where the people are the masters. The current National Government is a revolutionary government.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<p>A New Era in Relations Between Kang and Tibet (III) Liu Zunqi (V) After returning to their native place, the kind monks of Da Jin are still monks of the Xikang Temple and should strictly abide by the rules of the Yellow Sect and abide by the law. If there is any arbitrary instigation that leads to disharmony between Kang and Tibet or incidents involving human life, as well as conflicts caused by local people due to grievances with the temple, the Sichuan and Kang officials should investigate the truth and punish them according to the law. Those who are related to destroying the reconciliation between the two sides can also notify Tibet based on friendly relations. If any Yi people or others harm the monks of Da Jin Temple for no reason, the monks are allowed to submit a request to the local government for strict punishment. (VI) When the kind monks of Da Jin Temple return, they must submit a written guarantee that they will never cause trouble. The headmen of the five tribes of Bairi Rizhi Adou Huoer and various temples who had previous grudges with the monks of Da Jin Temple must also submit a written guarantee that they will never seek revenge in order to quell disputes and eliminate hidden dangers. (VII) Da Jin Temple should appoint a Khenpo, who must be a person of great virtue. However, Niangxian must first notify the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters of the name and obtain their consent before the Khenpo is appointed by Xibi. In addition, the monks of the temple should jointly recommend a person of public trust to assist, but the name must first be reported for approval before deciding on the above Khenpo assistant, but both are only in charge of the temple's religious affairs. (VIII) The losses suffered by Da Jin Temple in burning down the Dengke County Government, killing officers and soldiers, and innocent people should be compensated by the monks of Da Jin under the order of Tibet to pay 25 taels of gold to repair the county government and compensate the officers and soldiers because the two sides have reconciled. (Note) Four copies of this agreement and regulations are written, one for each representative of both parties, and the remaining two copies are submitted to the superiors for record. This agreement is mainly in Chinese and is approved by the superiors of both parties. The listed regulations are to be observed by officials and civilians alike. Seal of Qiu Lisheng, Representative of the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters Seal of Deko, Representative of the Tibetan Kashag January 9, 24th year of the Republic of China, Deko</p>
<p>4.  Final Conclusion and its Significance The above eight regulations have great effect in two points. First, it began to show the attitude of the Tibetan side turning to compromise. Second, it specifically stipulated the legal status of the Da Jin Temple Lama, but it omitted many practical key points, such as the most important thing, the guns possessed by the Da Jin Temple Lama (whose source is self-evident) were not limited in their ownership and number. Secondly, the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters compensated for the repair of the main hall of the Da Jin Temple, and the Da Jin Temple's compensation to the Gan merchants and the Dengke County Government were ambiguous, and there were no specific provisions, and so on. For this reason, although some monks of Da Jin Temple returned to the east bank of the Jinsha River in the past three or four years, the guns were not handed over, and many disputes still occurred from time to time. At the same time, the restoration of the main hall of the Da Jin Temple, because the current regulations only stipulate that the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters "make a wish" to raise donations, and no funds have been used for construction, the emotions are still as tense as before. After the start of the War of Resistance, the attitude of the front has further changed, and its understanding of the central government and the Sichuan and Kang authorities is also very different. It has adopted a completely supportive attitude, and the influence of British politics cannot be ignored. The Xikang authorities must also consider the overall situation and do their best to seek stability in the rear. Therefore, the two sides are getting closer and closer, and they have expressed sincerity and tolerance in thoroughly resolving the Da Jin City case. Therefore, since last year, the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters has appointed Zhang Zhenzhong, deputy brigade commander of Liu Wenhui, and Fan Changyuan, magistrate of Dego, as representatives. The Tibetan side appointed Wang Qing Daiben and Secretary Wang Tingxuan as representatives, and in Dego, based on the eight articles of the previous regulations for the placement of kind monks of Da Jin Temple, they specifically and thoroughly negotiated a solution, which was officially signed on January 2 this year. Because the signed documents must be delivered by "Ula" (that is, the labor of applying cattle), they cannot be delivered to the Kang Provincial Government in one or two months, so the full text cannot be found for disclosure. However, the main points are stipulated as follows: (1) Da Jin Temple should compensate Gan and Shanxi merchants for the loss of goods and lives by 720 taels (each tael is equivalent to 160 silver dollars, which is equal to 80 legal currency). However, Da Jin Temple only needs to pay 320 taels. Liu Wenhui recognizes 190 taels, and Changdu Zhesa Lama and Zhesa Suocan each lose 190 taels. Then, 20 taels will be exempted by Gan Jia merchants. (2) The destroyed Dengke County Government should be repaired with 100 taels. Among them, Da Jin Temple compensated 25 taels to the public, and the public returned the house owner A Du Tusi of the county government. Da Jin Temple directly compensated 25 taels to the county government. Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang Zhenzhong donated 15 taels, Tibetan representative Wang Qing Daiben donated 10 taels, Dego County Magistrate Fan Changyuan donated 1 tael, and Dego Tusi donated 15 taels, totaling 100 taels, all paid to Dengke A Du. (3) The regulations for compensation for casualties stipulate that Da Jin Temple should pay 25 yuan for medical expenses for each of the three wounded Han merchants and 15 taels for the four deaths. (4) For the construction and repair of the main hall of Da Jin Temple, the Garze County Government will appoint 150 migrant workers for one month. Within this month, Da Jin Temple will pay each worker 10 Tibetan silver dollars. After one month, Da Jin Temple will directly recruit and hire workers for construction and repair. (5) Regarding the issue of weapons, all the guns issued to Da Jin Temple by Lhasa will be recovered by Lhasa. However, 30 guns will be retained for the use of Da Jin Temple, as self-defense guns, and a passport will be obtained from the government. Usually, the gun body is stored in the temple, and the handle and ammunition are stored in the county government and issued when necessary. On the evening of the establishment of the above regulations, the representatives of Kang and Tibet and the officials and lamas in Dego gathered together to celebrate. When the telegram arrived in Kangding, the provincial government was about to be established. The whole city was overjoyed and regarded it as a new era in relations between Kang and Tibet. Today, when the War of Resistance is the most difficult, when the × people are using all their strength and means to divide the various components of our country and sow discord in the unity of our entire nation, Tibet, which has been regarded as "outside of civilization" by historians for decades or even two thousand years, has shown unprecedented enthusiasm and thoroughly resolved the most troublesome problem in Kang and Tibet, the Da Jin Temple case. It cannot be said that it is a great success in the middle of the War of Resistance. On the other hand, it is a blow to the conspiracy of the × people to sow discord. … What a joyful thing this is! We only hope that our brothers in Xikang can go further and further on the road and fully cooperate with the overall policy of the War of Resistance and national construction in politics and military affairs and strive for progress. At the same time, the Xikang authorities must also do well on this new foundation, be selfless, and seek the thorough unity and cooperation of the Han and Tibetan peoples and consolidate our southwestern half of the national defense like steel.

<p>The European Situation is Tense: Rumors of Germany and Italy Preparing to Launch War; French Prime Minister Calls Defense Meeting 【Associated Press, Washington, 25th】According to an article by Scripps Howard News Service's international editor, Simms, confidential sources in London and Paris believe that Germany and Italy are prepared to launch war simultaneously in early March. Germany will move against Romania because King Carol is unwilling to compromise with Germany. At the same time, Italy will demand from France, at a minimum, autonomy for the 95,000 Italians in Tunisia, the transformation of Gibraltar into a free port, the demilitarization of Corsica, and a share in the management of the Suez Canal. It is also reported that Germany plans to seek an understanding with Britain: if war breaks out between France and Italy and Britain does not participate, Germany will remain neutral.</p>
<p>【Associated Press, London, 25th】According to some diplomatic figures, well-informed sources in London and Paris firmly believe that a second major crisis in Europe will occur within a month. Hitler is scheduled to speak to the Reichstag on the 30th, at which time he may reveal the timing, scope, and manner of the crisis. Both London and Paris feel that if the Spanish government forces fail, it will be difficult to get Italian troops to withdraw from Spain. Some say the Italian troops may withdraw a few thousand, but German troops will seize the opportunity to enter. Public opinion in France is becoming increasingly hardened, believing that Mussolini's actions should not be conceded.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Berlin, 25th】The German Reichstag will meet at 8:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on January 30.</p>
<p>【Associated Press, Berlin, 25th】Representatives from Austria and the Sudetenland will attend the January 30 meeting of the German Reichstag, the first time since the Nazi Party seized power. Hitler will give a speech at the meeting, widely believed to review the tense relations between the United States and Germany, and will also mention U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes and Senator Pittman. Otherwise, the content of his speech will focus on foreign policy, especially issues related to Southeastern Europe and strengthening the German-Italian axis.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Paris, 25th】French Prime Minister Daladier convened the National Defense Committee today. The country's Ministers of the Navy and Air Force and the Chiefs of Staff of the various military branches attended.</p>

<p>Italian Prime Minister to Launch Another Four-Power Conference</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, London, 26th] This morning, it was widely rumored here that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will launch a four-power conference as soon as Barcelona falls. However, this news has not been confirmed or denied by well-informed sources. According to some opinions, this rumor originated from the Italian Prime Minister expressing his intention to clean up various unresolved Mediterranean issues when the British Prime Minister returned a visit to Rome, and believing that the four-power conference is the best method. It is said that the issues to be discussed at the future conference will include Italy's demands on France, namely the Tunisian issue. According to political circles, the declarations made by England and Germany at the Munich Conference, the declaration by France and Germany in Paris, and the Anglo-American agreement are all aimed at resolving international issues, so convening a conference at this time can be considered the most opportune time. The Daily Mail also received a report from a Rome reporter stating that Mussolini is determined to launch a four-power conference and proposes to put three issues related to the future of Spain on the agenda, namely (1) methods to avoid another civil war in Spain, (2) strengthening Spain's freedom with the assistance of Germany and Italy, in accordance with the will of the Spanish people, (3) guaranteeing that the four powers prevent the establishment of a communist or Popular Front government in Madrid or Catalonia. Furthermore, political circles here are not paying much attention to France's calling up of the 1918 reserve team and the rescheduling of French Chief of Staff Gamelin's visit to Morocco, as it is expected that there will not be any serious problems between France and Italy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, 25th] An official communiqué has been issued stating that the government has decided to call up a batch of reserve soldiers born in 1901, totaling 60,000, to enlist for training on the first day of next month.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 25th] "Le Temps," which has close ties to the French government, published an article yesterday that is quite noteworthy. The article stated that if the rebels achieve a decisive victory in Spain and foreign troops remain stationed in the country, France's unavoidable obligation is to acquire a counterbalancing position for itself. Places such as Minorca and Spanish Morocco could be occupied in one fell swoop. France could use troops from French Morocco, in the name of the Sultan, to occupy Spanish Morocco. In addition, former French Prime Minister Léon Blum published an article in "Le Populaire," stating that he is paying close attention to the situation in Germany. According to Léon, activities will inevitably occur within Germany and Italy in the near future. Léon said that the two dictators, now encountering such domestic problems, are paying attention to foreign affairs and intensifying preparations to increase the danger of war. This is the biggest mistake.</p>
<p>Barcelona Falls: Rebel Troops Enter Yesterday Afternoon; Refugees Flee to France</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 26th] Officials here announced that Spanish rebel troops entered Barcelona at noon on the 26th.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Lleida, 25th] Currently, two-thirds of the city of Barcelona has been surrounded by rebel troops. Although it is hoped that the rebels will not enter the city until it is completely surrounded, it can be attacked at any time.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Paris, 26th] According to reliable sources, the Foreign Minister of the Spanish Republican government has been consulting with French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris since last week to organize refugee camps on the French border of the Pyrenees that can accommodate 150,000 people. It is said that the French government advocates only allowing women, children, and the elderly to cross the border as refugees. The Times also reported that those fleeing from Catalonia to France are being closely monitored because the fall of Barcelona will have a major impact on the Spanish civil war and the European situation.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Paris, 20th] Military reports from Barcelona have not been received here last night, for the first time since the war began. It is unclear whether the Spanish government has stopped issuing military reports or whether news from the city has been cut off. A report received at midnight stated that the city is in utter chaos, and the remaining residents are hiding in air-raid shelters to avoid enemy aircraft constantly circling overhead. Since this week, about 200,000 people have fled from the city to northern Catalonia, and the sound of artillery fire is clearly audible in the southwest.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cerbère, 25th] According to reports from Spanish rebels, government troops in the Pyrenees near Urgell have been isolated due to the rebel occupation of Solsona. It is also said that this will guarantee the final collapse of the government army's Pyrenees Catalonia position. At the moment, General Yagüe's Moroccan troops are waiting on the Zumonzhi heights outside Barcelona, while the Navarre troops are advancing along the Llobregat River through Manresa and Terrassa. Franco's strategy is the same as the one he adopted in Bilbao, that is, to carry out a large-scale encirclement first and then attack the city in order to avoid street fighting.</p>
<p>Reuters, Perpignan, 25th] A train that left Barcelona today has arrived at the French border with more than 200 women and children, who have not eaten for two days. Another train wanted to leave the city, but the tracks had been bombed and had to return to the city. When the refugees were waiting for the train at the station, four Savoia-type rebel bombers soared in the sky. The refugees, who had been hungry for many days, were exhausted and fled to the dark streets when they heard the sound of the planes. Rebel planes were very active, circling over various highways and railways, bombing vehicles and strafing them with machine guns. It is said that many soldiers escaped into the various French coasts by fishing boats and were disarmed by the French gendarmes.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th] The British Minister to Barcelona and the remaining staff of the embassy boarded the cruiser HMS Devonshire today. The ship will not leave for the time being to await developments. The destroyer HMS Greyhound, which carried the families of the British Embassy to Marseille yesterday, has returned here. The British Consul General in Barcelona will also not leave for the time being.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 26th] According to dispatches from Burgos, thousands of trucks loaded with food are now waiting near Barcelona, ready to enter the city with Franco's troops. It is said that entry into the city will be restricted to prevent refugees from other provinces from entering the city, and only those with special passes will be allowed to enter. Only those with relatives in the area will be allowed to stay. The refugees will be sent back to their original provinces as soon as possible. The civilian guards will patrol the city, and the people will resume work as soon as possible after the rebels enter the city. The banks will open immediately, the hospitals will be expanded, and the members of the city council have been appointed and announced in the newspapers and will hold a meeting as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Regarding the matter of abolishing the U.S. arms embargo on the Spanish Republic, after former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, 35 state ministers of Christianity jointly wrote to President Roosevelt to support it, stating that the embargo should be stopped immediately. If hesitation continues, not only will the Spanish Republic and other democratic countries be harmed, but the interests related to our lives and the peace of the world will also be affected.</p>
<p>"You Cannot Live if You Commit Evil"</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Paris, 26th] Yesterday morning, a Spanish national bomber suddenly encountered a violent hurricane near Arles, France, on the French border of the Pyrenees and crashed. Two military officers and three staff members on board were killed. When the accident occurred, three people tried to parachute, but could not open due to the strong winds. The plane was a German-made Kurl III-style aircraft equipped with two machine guns.</p>
<p>Representatives of Charity Organizations in Shanghai, Yu Bin, Ordered to Go to the United States; Speech in Paris: China Determined to Fight to the End</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] Yu Bin, Bishop of the Nanjing District of China, as a commissioner of the Refugee Relief Committee, a representative of various charity organizations in Shanghai, and Chairman of the Catholic Relief Society, was ordered to go to the Americas. He passed through Rome and paid respects to Pope Pius XI. Upon arriving in Paris, he immediately issued a statement to the press, stating that the time for the Catholic Church to develop in China has come. China is determined to fight to the end for independence and territorial integrity. When I paid respects to the Pope in Rome, I presented a public letter from our government regarding the innocent Chinese women and children who have been subjected to the poison of new weapons. The Catholic clergy sincerely and earnestly provide relief and express their gratitude. The Pope was very moved after reading it and immediately offered special blessings to me and the people in the Americas who have contributed to the relief efforts and bestowed commemorative medals with great kindness, which is truly inspiring. Bishop Yu Bin also described the suffering that China has experienced and the bombing of various undefended cities by aircraft, saying that millions of Chinese have died and no less than 300,000 are homeless. When Yu Bin was asked about the hope for peace, he replied that the word "peace" was proposed by the aggressors in order to control China under the pretext of peace. China will not accept peace unless it is fair and lasting. Finally, he said that the Catholic Church has a major mission in China. The Chinese government and the church trust each other, because the Catholic Church in China is the Chinese church, and in France, it is the French church. In short, it serves the country where it is located and has no foreign influence. The benefits that the Chinese people have received from the Catholic Church are incomparable. If he, at the age of 62, is determined to lead the Red Cross and serve at the front, he is a Belgian priest who has naturalized in China (that is, Father Leiminghuan). The Benedictine priest from Belgium is the army priest of the Red Cross relief team. The French Jesuit priest Jiajiju, who organized the refugee area, is admirable. The Catholic Church is suitable everywhere, and the future is very optimistic.</p>
<p>German Staff Officer Praises the Soviet Army: Estimates About 9,000 Soviet Aircraft; German Team to Visit Russia for Trade</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 26th] The Nazi Party newspaper "Völkischer Beobachter" published an article by Colonel Zeiss, a member of the German General Staff, praising the Soviet Army. In his article, he stated that although the Red Army has lost its special strength due to the transfer of senior officers, it is a big mistake to not take into account the Red Army's continuous expansion, which increases its combat power. Judging from the precedents of the last war and the Zhanggufeng Incident, the Soviet soldiers' bravery, hard work, and perseverance are beyond doubt. Every soldier knows how to exert his combat effectiveness under good command. Zeiss estimated that the Soviet air force has about 9,000 aircraft and reserve aircraft. However, not all of these aircraft are the latest models. According to reliable business sources, Germany is forming a business inspection team that will soon go to Russia. The task of this team is to negotiate the acquisition of raw materials from Russia in exchange for German manufactured goods. The number of permanent commercial representatives from the Soviet Union in Berlin has decreased from 230 to 30 in the past few years and may increase again.</p>

<p>Grass Court Tennis Championships: Decision to Hold Starting March 6</p>
<p>The number of participants is limited</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Hong Kong has four open tennis championships every year, organized by various tennis clubs in turn. There is the men's open singles and doubles hard court tournament, which is organized by the Navy Civilian Joint Entertainment Association; the mixed doubles tournament, which is organized by the Chinese Recreation Club; the women's singles and doubles tournament, which is organized by the Women's Sports Association; and the most important men's open grass court singles and doubles championship, which is organized by the Hong Kong Cricket Club next to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which is also the origin of the Hong Kong Tennis Bronze Medal Tournament.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the Open Grass Court Tennis Championship has been determined to open in early March every year. It is reported that this year's organizers have recently decided to hold it starting March 6, but because of the recent gathering of talents in Hong Kong, there are concerns that too many participants will affect and prolong the time. Therefore, it was decided to add some restrictions this year. Although it still specifies that anyone who resides in Hong Kong and is a registered member of the Hong Kong Tennis Association is eligible to register, it has been decided that only 64 people will be accepted for the singles competition, and only 30 pairs will be allowed to participate in the doubles competition. The registration deadline is 6 pm on February 18. If the number of people exceeds the quota at that time, the organizers have the right to select the best.</p>
<p>It is estimated that this open tournament is scheduled before the Central Tournament, and all matches will be played in a best-of-three-sets format, while the semi-finals and finals will be played in a best-of-five-sets format. Anyone who wishes to participate should register with the Hong Kong Cricket Club as soon as possible. (Flying Alive)</p>
<p>Alice Marble's Secrets to Tennis Success (3)</p>
<p>Translated by: Court Old Partner</p>
<p>The next day, I watched the performance of the two in detail as she said. As a result, Wales won two sets, but there was only one dead ball victory. I reported this to Miss Brown. She listened and said, "Do you understand now? The method you used yesterday is a technique that even the army is difficult for her to develop. From now on, when you return to your hometown, practice the forehand and backhand strokes. When you have learned it, you will naturally be an excellent tennis player."</p>
<p>After returning to my hometown, I worshiped Miss Qilianna Danneng as a teacher. I made great progress in the second year and jumped to become the seventh person in the United States. However, the pommeling technique is not easy to learn. It took me an unknown amount of time, patience, and hard work to learn it. I have sacrificed temporary victories many times to learn the pommeling technique. Therefore, I think that if you want to learn a new technique, you should always use it. Even if you are about to lose in a competition due to not being proficient, you should not use the old method again. You must practice the new method hard until it is successful, because the new method can only be practiced in fierce competitions.</p>
<p>I now firmly believe that the bottom-line smashing technique is outdated. Now is the time to discuss the competition method, the aerial interception method, and the high-pressure method on a good court, and to become a full-court smashing technique. The progress of women's tennis and the ability to obtain independent power are as powerful as women's participation in commerce, politics, medicine, art, science, and even aviation and radio knowledge. The Polish champion, Chedefa Zusga, who is also the women's runner-up at Wimbledon and Linsan, once said to me, "After I return to Poland next time, I will focus on practicing your American women's railing and high-pressure techniques."</p>
<p>I believe that there is no definite right way to play tennis, and I have also realized that there is no definite way to hold the racket. I believe that I have found a shortcut to success, and my teacher has also used this shortcut to teach a Bobby Riggs to make him jump to the position of star.</p>
<p>The method is like this: when I make a forehand hit, I use the Eastern grip method, because in this way, we can not only get the same quick power as the Western grip method, but also get the stability of the Ormond grip method. At the time, I also felt that the posture of Van Ness, Boch, Pan Lai, Jiede Zusga, and Miss Langde, who circled the racket in a semi-circle after hitting the ball, was a good propulsive force. If you add some outward rotation force when hitting the ball, you can completely control the ball under your control.</p>
<p>I hope that there is no one who does not want to have the forehand smashing power of Zidezhi Zusga, but few people have such strong power. If you retreat and ask for the next best thing, then I think that Van Ness's stop-hand hitting method is fast and appropriate, and it is the best hitting method I have ever seen. After my detailed investigation, I feel that when he hits the ball, his shoulders and feet form a 45-degree angle with the net, which is completely different from the side-body method of many experts. The ball is hit just in front of the left foot. As for the residual force of the racket, it is first pushed out to the net, and then slightly curved to the left. The degree of curvature never crosses the body, which is what we should all emulate, because the weakness of ordinary residual force after hitting the ball is that it crosses the body. (To be continued)</p>
<p>One of Hong Kong's Sports Undertakings:</p>
<p>Curnie's Gymnasium - Wang Xuezheng -</p>
<p>(8) The required equipment is very simple and easy to prepare. Moreover, most of the equipment can be replaced by furniture, etc.</p>
<p>(9) The degree of exercise can be adjusted at will, depending on the individual, so as not to suffer from the harm of over-exercise.</p>
<p>(10) Correct the wrong posture of the body and improve health and beauty.</p>
<p>(11) For ball games and other sports, special freehand exercises and equipment exercises can be performed according to the different needs of each person. For example, football players, basketball players, sprinters, long-distance runners, high jumpers, etc., each have specially designed physical training methods.</p>
<p>(12) Mass-oriented, suitable for both groups and individuals.</p>
<p>However, many people believe that this type of exercise can not only cause muscle stiffness (Muscle bound), making movements clumsy, and can also cause various heart diseases, making blood vessels hard, and even leading to death. Although this is a common fact, this is not a drawback of freehand exercises and equipment exercises themselves. The reasons for causing this drawback are nothing more than the following three: (1) Errors in methods, such as too many or too few exercises, too heavy equipment, incorrect posture, incomplete movements, incorrect breathing, etc.; (2) The exercise does not have a certain system, the exercise is too intense, and the muscles and internal organs cannot be developed evenly; (3) The exercise is intermittent, there is no fixed time.</p>
<p>If there are no above-mentioned errors, this type of exercise will never cause muscle stiffness and other drawbacks.</p>
<p>The effect of equipment exercise is really better than freehand exercise. If we engage in equipment exercise and want to achieve the greatest effect, we must do progressive and vigorous exercise. The most important thing is to follow a certain system from light to heavy.</p>
<p>In today's extraordinary times, the need for exercise is even more urgent, but the opportunity for exercise has been reduced due to the war. Although advocating freehand exercises and equipment exercises can solve this problem, there are many problems and difficulties in engaging in this type of exercise, especially vigorous equipment exercise, that are often not easy for us to solve individually, such as the perseverance, spirit, interest, time, equipment, location, clothing, bathing, appropriate guidance, number of exercises, correct posture, thorough movements, breathing methods, and systematic exercise procedures. In short, there are too many such problems to list.</p>
<p>Regarding this type of problem, opinions vary, and each says different things. In addition, everyone's physical fitness is different, and if you want to solve this problem, you must also "prescribe the right medicine." Just in terms of exercise methods, what is not suitable for A is not only suitable for B, but sometimes even harmful. Moreover, it is better to believe in a book than to have no book, and it is better to see with your own eyes than to hear with your ears. Therefore, without long-term and rich experience, it is not easy to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Professor Curnie has been engaged in physical education in our country for more than 20 years and has a deep understanding of the physical characteristics of the Chinese people. He has trained many strong young men and women, and he is also very willing to solve the above-mentioned problems and difficulties for us.</p>
<p>Curnie's Gymnasium was first established in Shanghai in 1930. The author's stomach disease was very serious at the time, and medical treatment was ineffective. Later, I joined the gymnasium. Under the guidance of Professor Curnie, it took only half a year, and not only my stomach disease, which had not been cured for many years, greatly improved, but also my physical strength and spirit improved rapidly. Also, the author's heart was very weak in the past. If I ran a little, I would feel dizzy and my heart would jump. Since joining Curnie's Gymnasium, my weight has increased greatly, my heart has become stronger and stronger, and my illnesses have also decreased. The author's physical foundation was established at this time, and the author's interest in this type of exercise can also be said to have been inspired by Professor Curnie.</p>
<p>This is all the author's personal experience, but from the above, it can be seen that Mr. Ke serves the crowd well.</p>
<p>Professor Curnie is not only experienced, but also has a deep research on this knowledge, combining medicine and sports into one. Also, Mr. Ke has extraordinary physical strength. No matter what his physical appearance, his arms are 17 inches thick and his chest is 47 inches wide. From this, it can be seen that his theory is completely derived from the results of experiments and is by no means an empty theory.</p>
<p>About four years ago, Mr. Ke came to Hong Kong from Shanghai and established the Hydro Therapetfe Instftue, making various efforts to benefit the crowd.</p>
<p>Mr. Ke has a relationship with the relationship between our country's war of resistance and the physical fitness of the people. He is very happy for the young men and women of our country to join the hospital and engage in various freehand and equipment exercises.</p>
<p>Although freehand etiquette exercises and equipment exercises are the most effective and simplest physical training methods, everyone can do it themselves, but before having a deep understanding of this type of exercise, we should first refer to various books and newspapers, and at the same time, ask for guidance from experienced and knowledgeable people.

<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<p>Entertainment... First Love</p>
<p>Love Finds Andy Hardy</p>
<p>Every movie that portrays the Hardy family can give the audience a fresh interest. This type of movie is full of reality and can reasonably express a large number of interesting life experiences. The depiction is so realistic that the audience almost personally experiences everything in the movie and is moved by the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and joy in this family. Now this "First Love," the fourth Hardy movie, has a very deep and realistic depiction of the love psychology of young men and women. Andy (played by Mickey Rooney) is busy with love and shuttles between three women. One is the one he sincerely loves, one is the one his friend entrusted him to take care of, and the other is a sincere and enthusiastic friend who has given him a lot of help. At the same time, the family has encountered an unfortunate event. Andy's grandmother is seriously ill and her life is uncertain. His mother has to leave home to take care of her personally. In this situation, they are preparing to have a sad Christmas, but suddenly his mother comes back with good news and gives them a "happy" gift, and the family spends a carnival Christmas.</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney has worked particularly hard in this movie and has achieved better results than in previous movies. Louis Stone plays a serious and sincere elder and is the most outstanding character in this movie. In addition to the original cast, there is also a singing child star, Judy Garland, whose sincere and moving expressions and clear and melodious singing also occupy an important position in this movie.</p>
<p>Queen of Peace</p>
<p>Models' Paris Conference</p>
<p>Artists and Models Abroad</p>
<p>It is the first comedy in 1939 with excellent sound and color. Starring Jack Benny and Joan Feina, it has a lively and interesting theme, excellent and beautiful reports, and crazy and funny performances, giving the audience unlimited light and happiness. Undoubtedly, this movie is an entertaining work.</p>
<p>Jack Benny leads a large group of American models who are trapped in Paris but have no money. Later, he meets the daughter of an American oil tycoon in a cafe. She happens to be short of money, so he mistakenly thinks that she is also a girl wandering in a foreign country like him, so he invites her to join their group. This rich girl, who is used to living a noble life, agrees in order to find excitement and fun. So they live a life of wandering, eating without a fixed place, and making trouble everywhere. As a result, the lucky Jack Benny actually gets the love of this golden girl.</p>
<p>The cast in this movie is also quite complete, including the Yacht Four Brothers and a large group of excellent female actors. The costume performance in one scene is even more magnificent and gorgeous, and it is the most worthwhile performance in this movie.</p>
<p>Eastern - Blocking Spain</p>
<p>Blockade</p>
<p>It is a movie that depicts the activities of traitors during the war. However, on the one hand, it wants to expose the sins and cruelty of war. This is probably a point that the author pays special attention to.</p>
<p>Although there are no great war scenes inside, a few scenes are lively enough. The director uses very lively shots to reflect the remnants of war. In the blockade area, the people are dying.</p>
<p>Henry Fonda and Delin Carroll also perform well.</p>
<p>Dahua... Car Front Probe</p>
<p>Tip-off Girls</p>
<p>Although it is said to be a detective movie, the performance is not tight enough, and the director does not have skillful techniques to make it lively and vivid, so the results cannot be very good.</p>
<p>This movie is about a detective who joins the ranks of thieves to spy on secrets, thus capturing the bandits in one fell swoop and lovers finally getting married. This kind of clichéd story is not easy to please the audience if there are no exciting scenes. The main actors, such as Lao Ai Lun and Ellie Kara Sel, also have mediocre acting skills.</p>
<p>New World... True and False Wu Zetian</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>A commodity that wants to use fragrant and sensual flesh as a gimmick, it uses a stage celebrity with a naturally lewd personality as the central figure of the movie, and her private life of playing Wu Zetian on stage as the descriptive material. The strange and unbelievable content may cater to low-level tastes, but the so-called fragrant and sensual scenes are not dared to be thorough, only to disappoint the audience. Ordinary audiences are numb.</p>

<p>Free Talk: The Task of Writers in the Period of Active Anti-Japanese Price Quotation</p>
<p>Du Ai</p>
<p>1. Characteristics of the Current Situation</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has developed to a new stage. In this new stage, the task of the cultural movement is even more arduous and great. The Anti-Japanese War literature and art movement is an important organizational part of the entire cultural front. There is no doubt that it needs to stand at the new stage of the War of Resistance, strengthen its work practice, and expand its scope of work.</p>
<p>However, a cultural worker, especially a combatant in the literary and art movement, must first understand the general situation and characteristics of the new stage of the War of Resistance before engaging in the more intense and serious work of the new stage. Only by deeply understanding the complex content of the reality of the new stage of the War of Resistance and the basic trend of its development can the pen of the literary and art worker play a more critical, instructive, and promoting role.</p>
<p>2. Progress in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>However, what are the characteristics of the new stage of the War of Resistance? This is mainly reflected in two aspects. On the progressive side, we have summarized the past eighteen months of the War of Resistance, which has made us believe even more that the War of Resistance has not made "truth" rusty. On the contrary, the War of Resistance has made the light of truth shine more powerfully. Today, the increasing persistence of the War of Resistance and the increasing political progress have further silenced the "always trembling" lips of pessimists; at the same time, it has uncovered the blind eyes of gentlemen who "observe reality from a mechanical point of view." The convening of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China, the increase in international assistance, the purge of the traitor Wang Jingwei, and the holding of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang have given the War of Resistance a new start. It makes the "backward" parts of the country more likely to become "progressive" things. And this new situation more powerfully promotes the united front of the entire nation to gradually develop to a higher stage, making the "patriots" who doubt the protracted War of Resistance and the united front have to come to a new understanding. This is one side of the great reality (the main, basic, and decisive side).</p>
<p>3. Traitors' Conspiracy</p>
<p>The characteristic reflected in the other aspect is that the current new progressive situation can also make the backward parts more conservative; especially the Japanese imperialists and the corrupt elements of peace compromise within us are afraid of this progress. Therefore, they want to instigate traitors, Trotskyites, etc. to do their best to sow discord, hinder our progress, and undermine our war of resistance. This estimate is no longer a question of "possible or impossible," but has become a steel-like fact. The newspaper of × people's organization here and the newspapers of traitors here are singing in chorus every day to carry out their shameless tricks of sowing discord and spreading rumors. Therefore, although the entire War of Resistance is heading towards progress, it must also require us to be more vigilant. Due to the complex content of this realistic and drastic change, we have come to the following conclusion: the traitors' separatist movement should not be regarded as the end of the movement. On the contrary, this is the beginning of the separatist movement. The reason why the separatist movement has not ended and the conspiracy of surrender and compromise has not ended is because the traitors' ambitions have not stopped. Moreover, now is the time for × people to launch a large-scale military offensive against the Northwest and Southwest, so the "fearless" actions of the traitors dare to continue under the nationwide beating are not without reason.</p>
<p>4. Two Key Points of the Realistic Program</p>
<p>The above points are the general situation and characteristics of the new stage of the War of Resistance. However, under these situations and characteristics, we can come to the following conclusion: that the current reality itself contains two opposing factors in development. The new political situation, the new development of the national revolutionary war, and the new development of the national united front are strengthening its breadth and increasing its degree, but it is still facing many difficulties (the new offensive of × people, the activities of pro-Japanese traitors). But in the same way, we must clearly point out in the characteristics of this reality that today's progress in all aspects is the harvest of one and a half years of war of resistance and the solemn result of the development of national history. Although it continues to discover new difficulties in the process of movement, it also continues to increase its new strength. This new strength will surely break through everything, overcome everything, and move forward uninterruptedly. Therefore, in the new situation, it is bound to continue to develop to a higher stage. However, this favorable development cannot do without the following solid guarantee: that is, to strengthen the work practice of each individual.</p>
<p>In today's new stage, the fighters in the literary and art circles should pay special attention to the two key points in the so-called "realistic program," that is, literary and art workers should be more closely integrated with the anti-Japanese war practice of the new stage. Under this premise, from this point of view, to "describe the real state of reality development." The so-called "state" should be clearly regarded as the overall "trend" of the vivid and advancing reality development. Secondly, writers should stand firmly on the scientific worldview, and intensify their study of materialist dialectics, not regard materialist dialectics as a ready-made code, a dead dogma, or a rigid formula; but regard materialist dialectics as a living thing, and its principles are flexibly applied to concrete and vivid facts to improve the writer's ability to deal with problems and a clearer perspective on reality.</p>
<p>Random Jottings on a March</p>
<p>Li Huiying</p>
<p>"If it doesn't work, go to court. Are you afraid of him? A short guy, with triangular eyes and a fleshy lump bulging under his nose, was waving his fist and shouting loudly, as if he was a hero who feared nothing in the world.</p>
<p>"That's right, Huanggang County is not afraid of anyone inside and out. If you go to court, he won't get any benefit. Damn it!" This man was a burly fellow, with thick arms and great strength. He could knock over three or four characters with one hand.</p>
<p>In the middle of this, there was a more refined one, tapping his dry tobacco pipe, calmly suppressing the others:</p>
<p>"Don't panic, don't panic, speak slowly. There is nothing that can't be done. If you can settle it yourself, it's best to settle it yourself."</p>
<p>However, the other side was not convinced, and indignant words shot out from the slingshot like bullets:</p>
<p>"Go to court? Go ahead! Who's afraid of who? Don't scare people with big talk!"</p>
<p>The group of people was in high spirits, and it seemed that there would be no end in sight for a while.</p>
<p>At this time, the doubts of Gao and I were dispelled, and we guessed their history, and then we suppressed our own nervousness. In the village, that evil force still exists. Local bullies are rampant everywhere. They are making a living and building a family on this. They can provoke disputes and stand up for injustice. The final result, if it is more civilized, is to profit from it. If it is more barbaric, they will extort. The group in front of them is a mixture of everything, the bad guys who are rampant in the countryside. (To be continued)</p>
<p>A Few Military Police of Jian Ku</p>
<p>When Nanjing was retreating, it was really difficult to get on the train to Shanghai in Xuzhou. The top of the car, the windows, the handrails, and even Zhan's J Hook were full of refugees. The platform was still full of people waiting for the train. Some were probably already. I had bought a ticket and waited for many days.</p>
<p>It was impossible to squeeze onto the express train, and it was even more impossible to squeeze onto the refugee train. In despair, I saw a carriage outside the station that had not yet been hung up. I took the idea of ​​trying to take a look, so I walked along the railway tracks. When I walked closer, I could see the chalk writing on the carriage, and I regretted taking this trip again. No wonder no one squeezed here, it turned out to be a military police special car.</p>
<p>I took the child and prepared to walk back. At this time, there was a snap on the car window, and a head wearing a copper helmet poked out.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"No, I came to see if there was an empty carriage. I have been waiting for the train for many days, and I can't squeeze up," I said and wanted to walk away:</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Another iron copper helmeted head popped out and asked.</p>
<p>"I'm from Nanjing and want to go to Hankou." I suddenly thought that they wouldn't suspect that I was some kind of Han traitor to explore their whereabouts. This thought forced me to leave the carriage quickly.</p>
<p>"Is it just the four of you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and two pieces of luggage."</p>
<p>"Okay, wait for me to ask the officer."</p>
<p>I couldn't walk away, but it was really not easy for me to stand there and wait for a few minutes. "Ask the officer" what does it mean? I was extremely uneasy. Not long after, the military police who went to ask poked their heads out again and asked:</p>
<p>"What do you do?"</p>
<p>"I used to work in a newspaper, and in recent years I have been teaching at ××. This time I escaped from my hometown."</p>
<p>"Okay, go and carry your luggage. We are also going to Hankou." Many people opened the door to greet me. Two military police jumped down and immediately carried my child into the car.</p>
<p>When I carried the luggage and sent it to the military police special car, my two children had become the center of the military police's joy. They scrambled to hug and kiss the children's rosy cheeks and used many candies to make the children laugh.</p>
<p>After taking off their steel helmets, I saw that they were all young people in their twenties. Some of them I saw were not even eighteen years old. They were lively, innocent, and sometimes childish, completely different from the shrewd and strong aura of being fully armed.</p>
<p>My doubts and uneasiness about them disappeared - slowly. I got along well with them, and slowly, I listened to their experiences, experiences, and ideas, and I couldn't help but admire them from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Yes, according to dead knowledge and age, I may be able to be their big brother, but on the other hand, in terms of living knowledge and experience, they can be my teachers everywhere.</p>
<p>Several months of battlefield experience have tempered them like pure steel. Suffering only makes them stronger. The constant threat of death only makes them more pure and more diligent.</p>
<p>"Every second, every place, there is a threat of death. If you are lucky, you can just avoid the place where the bullet passes through in that second. If you encounter it, there is nothing to say, that's life. In order not to die in that second, I can't wait to do a year's work in one hour. The treasure of time and the uselessness of fame and wealth, I am afraid that only people on the battlefield know the</p>
