<h3 id="c1">民主國家大團結　與我國當前的重要任務 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>德國侵略者於併吞捷克共和國以後，歐洲局勢愈見緊張嚴重與危急。一般熟悉國際情勢的觀察者，巳經一致指出希特勒將乘此聲勢煊赫所向無敵之際，積極準備進一步的侵略。據昨日電訊，「征服」捷克的法西斯軍隊，業巳離開捷京，紛紛東開，有以羅馬尼亞及南斯拉夫為劫奪目標之勢。同時且巳一面堅决拒絕前日英法兩國政府關於捷克事件的抗議，一面向羅馬尼亞提出經濟劫掠的『最後通牒』，於是形勢益形險惡，戰雲彌漫歐洲，而各國報章紛紛刊載，關於希特勒進一步侵喀陰謀的消息，卽平時在張伯倫政策下威唱『歐局巳較去年大為明朗』的倫教各報，包括泰晤士報在內，亦均一致指出：以希特勒墨索里尼為首的法西斯侵略者之慾難慼，一步成功，卽作第二步進攻。尤可注意的是德國侵略者今日進攻目標，不是保衛和平壁壘森嚴的蘇聯，而為進向東南，企圖造成地中海與中歐方面的第三帝國！由此可見侵略者今後的野心，巳不限于重分殖民地，而為重新分割歐洲，重新分割世界，當若千中間國家弱小民族先後征服以後，則其鋒刃所向，卽為平日以妥協政策縱容或協助侵略者的資本主義民主各國！同時為我們所不能忽視的：今日在歐洲縱橫跳梁的，不是野心天生的獨夫梟傑，而有羅馬——柏林——東京這「三角」同盟的存在，它們本身之間雖還存着多少矛盾，但是在整個侵略路綫上它們是密切聯系與一致行動的！今日德國侵略者由捷克東進南下，同時意大利侵略者亦正窺伺於歐菲之間，尤其是對於法國的步步包圍操刀欲割；而日本侵略者則更在遠東激劇展開其新的攻勢；佯作反蘇戰備，實則挺進西南；國際法西斯侵略者此種彼此協同以使民主各國東西不能兼顧，而從事劫奪與分割，在今日已為旣成事實。我們對於法西斯侵略者之新的陰謀與新的攻勢，曾經一再揭發。今日更應指出者，卽為此種陰謀攻勢積極發展的結果，巳使民主和平各國痛戚所受威脅的嚴重，而對於我們抗戰建國事業，自然亦有相當嚴重的威脅。</p>
<p>在此種嚴重威脅之下，民主和平各國大團結的問題，和平陣綫鞏固與擴展的問題，就被鄭重而迫急地提示出來了。所以這幾天國際上在烏雲密佈之中，居然亦有啓示未來光明與勝利的火花，特別令人注意的，第一是英法兩國放棄妥協外交，採取積極抵抗法西斯侵略者之步驟的傾向。表現在具體事實上的是英法政府關於捷克事件的對德抗議，是英法政府之召同駐德大使，是英法政府同時聲明决不承認德國併吞捷克，是英法政府關於合作抵抗法西斯侵略者的準備，尤其是英國內閣於十八日決定與全世界各愛好和平國家立即保持密切接觸，是英國政府之準備與蘇聯開始由經濟合作進展到政治合作，和法國總統之定期赴美訪問羅斯福，共商民主國團結問題。第二是美國聯同民主國家反對法西斯侵略以保衛世界和平的政策，愈加堅决與進步。表現在具體事實上的，是美總統羅斯福對於德國併捷之嚴厲聲斥與對於民主國家合作的大聲呼籲，是美國政府正式送出指責德國非法暴行的牒文，是美國財部之廢止美捷協定與實施對德經濟制裁，是參院外委會主席畢德門之提出廢止中立法案，是一切反對派聲勢之低落與人民反法西斯統一戰綫的拾頭。第三是將被侵略的羅馬尼亞，巳繼西班牙和我國之後，决定予侵略者以誓死持久的抵抗，以保衛其國家民族之主權領土。表現在具體事實上的，是羅政府之拒絕德國通牒，是羅政府之採取防禦步驟，下令動員五萬人準備應付艱危，特別是羅王之向英政府表示，倘英法蘇聯願予援助，則渠可聯合波蘭，保加利亞，希臘，土耳其，南斯拉夫等國，堅决對付侵略。此外，正在舉行聯共十八屆大會準備為保衛社會主義祖國，及維護各民族獨立與世界和平的蘇聯，業於十九日由外交人民委員長李維諾夫照會德政府，聲明蘇聯决不承認德國併吞捷克。同時，蘇聯駐英大使，亦巳連日偕同法美使節和英國外交當局進行協商，準備應付侵略者的冒險進攻。</p>
<p>我們看到了這些消息，首先可見法西斯侵略者之瘋狂冒險，有進無退，决無與之進行妥協的可能，這裏證明了一切企圖假名「反共」『反蘇』，而對法西斯侵略者實行妥協的主和論調，是毫無根據的；事實上還是帮助侵略強盜為非作惡以出賣民族破壞民主的罪惡行為！其次是民主和平各國開始積極走向團結之路的事實，證明了一切對於和平陣綫之悲觀論者，是毫無根據的，證明了一切誣蔑蘇聯外交政策的惡意造謠，是毫無根據的，同時，證明了一切詆毀我國聯合民主和平國家共同抵抗侵略之國策的無恥論調，也是毫無根據的！然而我們仍舊要在這裏注意，我們要防備浮囂無聊不負責任的樂觀傾向！我們要更深切地認識到民主國家大聯合可能性之日漸成熟，和和平陣綫鞏固與擴展的必然趨勢：不過同時還應注意民主國家相互間的矛盾仍在發展，而且和平陣綫前途的障礙與外來的襲擊仍極嚴重，一切對於民主國聯合與和平陣綫的錯誤觀念，亦依在嚴重存在。因此，我們一面要為增加抗戰建國鬥爭過程中的助力，而加緊促成民主國家的大團結，加緊鞏固與擴大和平陣綫；但是要完成這一任務，我們不祇迫急需要國民外交的總動員，國際宣傳的總動員，民主國家侵略國家以及一切被壓迫國家內人民大衆反法西斯爭鬥的總動員，同時還要加緊我國內各民族各黨派各階層的六團結，堅决支持持久抗戰，加緊軍事上經濟上政治上的進步，特別是趕快建立全國各地民意機關各省市縣參議會，用我們抗戰中實行民主政治的事實，來迎接全世界民主國家的大團結。</p>
<h3 id="c2">江南在動員中　三民主義青年團籌組支部　農民團體號召農民總動員 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（上海通訊）三民主義靑年團，江南支團籌備處，近發出宣言云，三民主義靑年團，是新興唯一的革命組織，巳被全國一致所共認，這是中國歷史發展的必然結果，中國革命現階段的要求：第一，要集中革命力量，爭取抗戰的最後勝利。第二，要發動革命力量，建設三民主義新中國的新基礎；第三，要培養新的繼續不斷革命的新力量。三民主義靑年團是適應這種需要而產生的，意義之人，使命之重，不可言喻。三民主義靑年團中央團部，欲在江南一帶，展開新的革命工作，特設立江南支團籌備處，加緊組織下級團隊，以　奠定新的革命基礎。</p>
<p>江南支團籌備處，經過三個月的積極籌備後，由京滬到滬抗一帶，下級　隊，均巳先後成　，尤其是在上海方面，在萬分惡劣的環境中，在黑暗勢力的句幽中，革命勢力的伸畏巳成功篷勃的氣像，無形中巳成了抗戰建國的主力。</p>
<p>惟江南一帶，在×人的壓迫下，形成了整個的黑暗世界，一切的反動勢力，都乘機伸長，不僅是封建殘　利用革命勢力名義，招謠撞駧，乘火打劫，而日本帝國，亦巧妙的利用革命勢力名議，魚目混珠，破壞中國革命，這是我們非常痛恨的一點。現在我們除積極的加緊工作，以工作　壓一切反動企圖外，希望各界當局，嚴予防範，痛予打擊，在三民主義旗幟下，團結一致，共認革命勢力之發展。</p>
<p>江南支團部，雖然只有短少的三個月籌備時間，但承各界的熱烈贊助，給我們工作上很多的便利，這是找們非常興而感謝的一點，我們當以堅苦的革命精神，加倍努力，以期迅速開展團務，使革命的新生命，普遍到整個的江南</p>
<p>十四日為上海第二期抗戰第一次宣傳週之晨界宣傳日，上海農民團體特發告全　農界同胞書，茲照　如次：全市親愛的　友們，中國的農民，是最當於革命性的，歷史上反抗壓迫，揭竿起義的，便大多是農民，中國對日抗戰，農民當然是一個主力軍，試看目前在前綫作戰的兵士，大多來自田間，而源源補充的，也都是人民羣衆，在後期抗戰中，　軍隊的補充而言，旣以農民為主體，在淪陷區方面談，則農民對於收　久地，更是唯一的基本隊伍，前歲淞滬四個月的血戰，激起了全市農民抗戰救國的熱情，大家都丟丁鋤頭，不是身列戎行，以熱血噴濺×人，便是組織戰劬服務隊，做輸送軍械，軍糧，諜報，以及建築防禦工事等工作。就是一般婦女們。也自動地担負起軍隊的炊事和慰勞等工作，×的砲火，縱可燬，我們的田園，然而燬滅不了我們抗戰的决心，正相反，×人侵略的砲火愈猛烈，我們抗×的情緒，也愈高漲，上海縱　淪陷，我們農友們始終守衛着祖宗遺留下來的寸土尺地，作最艱苦最英勇的鬥爭，然而，我們仔細地加以檢討，過去的努力，縱已有了相當的成績，但還仍覺不够，須知在這國家生死存亡的關頭，全國同胞對於國家貢献，態有超越一切歷史常例的表現，消極方面，應該忍受一切常人所不能忍受的艱難困苦，積極方面，尤當發揮我們最高度的潛在力量，與××週旋到底，現在列舉五事，作為我們農界同胞目前共同努力的目標：一，參加游擊戰，由一村一莊，到一鄉一鎮，以至一區一縣，凡在壯年，都應集合起來，組成游擊隊伍，游擊隊的任務，約有　點：一，乘虛襲擊×人，二，剷除漢奸，三，保護生產及其流通，四，加强政治訓練。二，從事生產，凡在游擊區內不受×人控制的地方，農民除從事游擊工作外，對農事决不能放棄，以保持長期作戰的給養，三，不合作運動與×人和漢奸，在經濟上應採不合作主義，一，拒絕偽幣，二，拒絕抽稅，三，絕對不以人力物力資×，四，拒絕×貨滲入游擊區內，四，奉行政府命令，政府在游擊區內，設置之行政機關，農民應絕對奉行其命令，以鞏固抗戰建國的力量。五。厲行國民精神總動員，蔣委員長最近頒佈的國民精神總動員綱領及其實施辦法，應該切實奉行，以達到三民主義建國的最高目的，以上五點，都是我們農友們今日急不容緩的工作，為了保衛我們的家鄉，為了爭取我們的國家民族的獨立自由和平等，我們要踏着先烈　血跡，誓與×人作殊死的奮鬥，上海是後方的總站，我們不僅不許他　　趁制，並目要根本把他奪回來。</p>
<h3 id="c3">古城的怒吼 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>成　，這個古城這個沒有自來水沒有公共汽車，馬路都是狹街小巷，店舖都是木造平房的古城除了「市民要服從防空司令部的命令及防　人員的指導」，大家出錢出力迅速完成本市的空防建設」，沒有空防設備不能保障大家生命財產安全」，眷家多備沙袋以防燃燒彈』，各家多置水缸蓄水以備消防使用』等，防空標語，及在各重要十字路口，堆置沙袋，有一位憲兵在那裏駐守外，正如其他許多後方的都市一樣。不够緊張，戰時色彩不够濃厚成都，這個四川省的省會的古成，它受抗戰的影嚮，聽設幾個月前才開始的。</p>
<p>然而，這個古城現在開始怒吼了</p>
<p>成都文化界發動了一個「建軍運動宣傳週」這宣傳週，是從五日開始，至十一日截至。</p>
<p>第一日，三月五日，從早晨起，全市每一家大小店戶，都升起了國旗，看這肅然熱烈的氣象，是不由得不感動的。下午一時首先在少城公園舉行歌詠大會，會塲的門口，掛着白地黑字的大橫額，上書「四川地廣人多出　出　要為全國模範」，門口之旁，用篾條和紙紥點成一二丈高的蔣委員長像，舉起了一隻鐵手，手臂上寫着：「起來，不願做奴隸的人們！」進去是一大廣塌，已黑漆一團的擠滿了盡是穿籃布衣衫的朴素男女學生相民衆，先由中央軍校軍榮隊演秦『土耳其序曲』，繼由天明，業餘，電信，靑年會等四歌詠團四部合唱「建軍歌」，航委會的政治部，神鷹劇團唱「神鷹之歌」，「建設大空軍」，軍校新生唱，「凱旋歌」，電信歌詠團唱『我們要戰爭』，戰區兒童邊疆宣傳團唱「流浪兒」，「難兒進行曲」，靑年進行曲」，當他們唱到「我們在砲火中長大……日本軍閥的砲火把我們鍛鍊成了　革命家，我們並不害怕缺少什麼，向日本帝國主義那裏去拿，終有一天終有一天令打回我們的老家』時，幾萬民衆，簡直感動和興奮到流下眼淚來了，最後，全塲幾萬人合唱「權牲已到最後關頭」，「救國軍歌」，「義勇軍進行曲」等曲，雄壯激昂的歌聲震動得天空的雲霓飛跑，躲在東京的日本軍閥聽了，帕也寒心呌道：「中國民氣不可侮」了！</p>
<p>歌詠大會結束後，從三時起，就是航空表演，兩隊飛機由東飛來，在市空軋軋地狂叫一會，就開　演習擲彈，忽而上飛，忽而下降，忽而又翻筋斗，市民聽到咕咕的怪叫，羣相竚立街頭，用手掌掩眼仰望，知道是自己的飛機在表演，街頭巷尾，都揚起了雷動的鼓掌，大家心裏浮起蘭州空戰的大勝利。一會兒，飛機擲下了無數的傳單，紅紅綠綠滿天飛，像落英紛，狀極美觀。再一會兒，傳單飛落地下，市民爭拾搶看，是「建設國軍打倒日本軍閥」，「建設國軍保匯衛民」，『人人當兵抗戰必勝』，『個個出力建國必成』，『良兵是良民的模範，良民是良乓的基礎』，『大丈夫從軍報國，好男兒效命疆塲』，『好鐵才打釘，好男要當兵』，「壯土要學岳武穆精忠報國，女兒須知秦良玉從軍殺×』，『戚繼光禦寇功垂萬世，花木蘭從軍名垂千古』等最勵人民踴躍服務兵役的標語。</p>
<p>傍晚五鐘點，是第三個節目——提燈大遊行的開始，五時之前，各機關團體就陸續蒞場了，共有差不多一百個單位，四萬多人，五時正開會，由省黨部主任委員黃李陸做主席，致詞略謂：「我國為抵抗侵略，擁護世界和平，對日抗戰，必須建設偉大之國防軍，才間取得最後之勝利，我們中國有的是人，以出個中國人，至少可以打一個日木人，但如果我們是一盤散沙，一個日本人倒可以役七個中國人。所以我國必需要全國軍事化，個個都是國防軍，日本是沒有不失敗的……」這些話，一個字一個字的刺着會衆的心，大家報他以雷鳴一樣的鼓掌。其後，有新疆囘民領袖堯樂博士演說『中國為整個的民族，漢努力建軍，粉碎×人　，復興中國」之　義，尤博得會衆歡呼雷動的擁歐。旋卽通過六項提案，提燈遊行便開始了，主席台上把火一點，台下的人也便跟看把自己手裏的燈籠點着了，燈籠不是普通的紙燈籲，是經過意象想出來的抗戰燈籠，有飛機，有軍艦，有唐克車，大砲等，各種各梯，應有盡有，其中最博得市民　發笑，而又令他們深省的，是「王八燈」「蛇吞象，和「日皇璇壺」等幾盞象徵燈，「王八燈」上寫看「不當兵的就是這個」，意思是鼓勵人民踴躍服務兵役，「蛇吞象』是粘成條小蛇爬在大象的身上，但蛇根本沒有把象吞下去的本領，反而有被象踏死的危險，這象徵日本的不能吞併中國，終必為中國所踏死，一日皇遊壺」是紥一個便壺，紥一個人身，算是日皇，上半身投在壺裏，下半身留在壺外，這象徵着抗戰第一期，日本已日暮途窮，終必失敗之意。</p>
<p>隊伍從少城公園會場出發，經西抑街，東御街，中東大街，春熙路，總府街，至中山公團解散，市民早知道這晚有提燈大道行，大　都早些吃了晚飯，鐵在　頭看熱鬧，人山人海，水洩不通，尤以繁盛區春熙路一　為甚，記者從會場跟着隊伍什發，到春熙路，被迫着站在路角一個多鏡頭，都打不過去，有很多人站在路邊，看不到路中央的瞪火，便從店裏拿出竹椅長凳等東西來，乘着脚看，大家看到空軍軍士學校飛將軍，看到中央軍校的大砲，唐克，及看到國旗，總理遺像和蔣委員長像，都熱烈地鼓掌和歡呼，隊伍中不時唱起了慷慨激昂的「起來，不顧做奴隸的人們！……」街旁的市民們也雄亮的唱和起來了，歌唱之後，跟着喊口號：「軍民合作抗戰到底！」「建設國軍打倒日本軍閥！」，中華民埃解放萬歲！」……隊伍中一個人須喊後，隊伍全體和路旁的市民一起跟着喊，一陳歌聲，一陣口號，震動得空中的北屬都要靜息下來了。……</p>
<p>聽說成都從來沒有這樣熱鬧過。</p>
<p>現在這個古城，華西的大都會被抗戰的砲火轟醒，開始怒吼了！</p>

<p>一個是抗戰中心　一個是商業總匯</p>
<p>婦女動員</p>
<p>當地人民的熱烈情緒，也並不後於其他各地，在社會方面，縣黨部民敎館在各鎭都有救國團體的組織，鼓勵各鎭居民踴躍捐款救國。記者至民敎館詢問，據說：他們自滬戰爆發以後，伸積極的組織地方民衆，開始在市區，對各戶居民指導防空防毒及救護的方法。現在，他們仍在進行組織民衆的計劃，希冀每一個蘭豁的人民，都能有充份的戰時智識，及救國的思想。同時，婦女方面亦頗有組織，除了婦女救護班外，他們亦計劃訓練蘭谿的花舫女，因為在蘭谿江畔，有許多的花訪，據縣政府最近的調查，城區有花舫二十一　，舫女九十人，年齡大都在十八歲至二十一歲間，然在這個十九舫女中，能識字的僅五人，其中略具刺　技能者八人，其餘都屬不識字而毫無技能者，而且這些舫女，平時大都空閒，所以計劃積極的訓練她們，使她們亦能為國家服務。其次蘭豁在城內西北城弄一帶，（包括上溪下街驟前北津街下長街等處），有茶室八十九家，她們都雇用茶女招待茶客，共計茶女有一百三十二人，這許多的茶女，年齡在十七至十九之間最多，故亦授以救護的智識，使為國服務，同時大部的舫女及茶女，她們亦都很願意受此訓練，這種精神，委實値得敬愛的。</p>
<p>參觀永昌</p>
<p>蘭谿有夜市，在西大街等處都很熱鬧，有幾家新開的洋廣舖子，市招都用霓虹燈，街上雖在晚上。來往的人仍很熙鑲。記者經城樓時，上設有有一民衆書館；便上去參觀，閱讀的人很多，所集各地的報紙極多，在書架上，有幾冊新出版的什誌，在蘭谿當地亦有報紙出版，同金華的金聲日報內容格式都差不多。蘭豁全縣統計有五二二二五人，在全縣九九十三鄉鎭中、都分區的編組訓練。「永昌為蘭谿的一個軍鎭，記者乃渡江乘公路汽車去參觀一次，車行六十分鐘左右卽達，下車為一條蜿曲的鄉道，再進則為一熱鬧的橫街，市容頗整，兩旁全是很大的店鐘，在街上找得了鎭公所，便進去訪問，據當地的鎮長所述：『本鎭抽訓壯丁的規則很嚴，不分富戶農戶，凡在壯了年齡的都得派往受訓，不能出綫代雇或故意推託。國家在這種時期，　們幹事絕對不應當隨便。否朋、便對不起國家了本鎭受訓練的壯丁已佔大數，至於鎭上人民的救國思想都很高，所以都很願出錢損募公債』，在內地的一個鄉鎭中　能有這樣的精神，也足以使人起敬、</p>
<p>此行印象</p>
<p>綜上這一個簡單的輪廓中，很足以顯示出今日的浙東，雖在軍事的後方，而他整個的組織，依然包持着很健全的機構，各地的經濟，政治，民衆組織，都在前進的途程中，吾們知道，要獲得最後的勝利，有了鞏固的戰綫，同時亦需要穩健的後方，今日中國後方各地社會組織的健全，民衆情緒的激烈，這便是獲得最後勝利的一個明顯的象徵。　（完）</p>

<p>— 嚴友</p>
<p>從山西寄來的一封信</p>
<p>××：你寄來的信，到今天　收到，經過五個月的時間，不知你在這五個月中生活上工作上起着怎樣的變化？我這幾天因為整頓學校內部，事情極忙，許多事情等看要做，雖然如此，晚仍要抽出時間來，寫這對信給你。</p>
<p>自從你囘國後，寫給你的信很少，一則因為　在家裏，許多　不能說，怕你家裏的人看見，二則你住在上海，在淪陷區域的上海，這　的情况也不能說，怕被　人檢查，　累你。現在知道你在香港可以轉信，以後當然要多寫一些信給你，現在先把這裏的情况，我的工作和志願，簡單的告訴你一些。</p>
<p>我現在在山西東南部第五行政區，這區域在去年六月以前，情况是不很好的，自從决死隊第三縱隊政治委員戎伍勝　任五區行政專員後，這裏的工作，就突飛猛晉，在民運工作方面，各縣（共計十二縣）各區各村的自衛隊婦女隊担架隊兒童團等，部已普遍的組織起來，每次舉行大會（如　蔣大會及各　紀念），每一個縣都能召集三四高有組織的羣衆到會，像耳呆一般大的小脚（比三寸　蓮還小）的婦女，巳從家庭中動員出來，三五成羣，坐着牛車赴會，兒童團的團長，都是十餘齡的小孩，嘴裏叫着淸淅的口令，雙手揮着小拳，領導唱救亡歌曲，誰看着這種情形，誰不能相信中國會亡。在文化教育方面，全五區有戰紙四十餘種，新華日報華北版也巳在這裏出版，書籍出版社，通訊社等，都巳建立了幾個月，出版和翻印書籍尙不少。學校方面，抗人（前紅軍大學改組）第一分校巳在此間開學，學生七千餘人，這是屬于八路軍的，軍政幹部學校第三分校（現改第十七分校，）是屬於伏死隊第三縱隊的，第五行政區民族革命中學（簡稱五區民中），是屬於五區的，太行山藝術學校是屬于三五兩行政區的，此外每個縣有民族革命高級小學，每個村有民族革命　級小學，除此以外，還有各種短期訓練班，識字班等等。全五區及各縣工人救國總會，農民救國總會，婦女救國總會。靑年救國總會，文化敎育界救國總會，商人救國總會等等，都巳經組織起來。</p>
<p>軍隊方面，這裏有中央軍，八路軍，决死隊等，和政權最有密切關係的，當然是决死隊。戎委員兼任專員，又是山西盟會（山西領導民衆運動的總機關）領導人，所以在五區軍政民巳經三位一體合作起來。</p>
<p>我最初到山西的時候，本想到八路軍中去工作的，工作巳經分配好了，只等車子起程，不想三縱隊奉命辦理隨營學校第三分校，因為沒有人辦，就給强拉到决死隊來，隨營三分校在前年十二月開學，到去年二月，因為辦理成績尙不差，奉命改為民族革命大學第　分校，到去年七月底，因各分校一列取消，又改為軍政幹部學校第三分校。我在隨營學校任校務主任，總理校務，在民大四分校任敎務課長。幹校和五區民中的校長都是閻司令長官，副校長都楚戎專員，我現任幹校政治主任，又因為閣戎兩校長實際都不能到校辦公，所以我又兼任幹校和民中的代理副校長。</p>
<p>隨營學校原設曲沃，改民大四分校後，因×人向晉南進攻，（去年二月底）遷翼　的曹公村，那時民大別的分校，都遷過黃河至陜西，獨我校誓死不渡過黃河，堅决留在×人後方，培養車政幹部。在曹公一月有餘，因距離三縱隊部太遠，過境雜軍太多，學　自衛能力不够，所以又遷浮山縣的山交村。在那裏一直住到去年十月，因晉東南久無×蹤，長治為晉東南（簡直可以說華北）惟一大城，為學校發展計，又遷長治，到今年一月底，因×人首先圍攻沁縣，次攻五台區，又攻晉西北，又攻晉西吉縣等處，又攻冀中冀南，看形勢將攻晉東南，所以又搬到山裏來，現在幹校和民中都在這山裏邊。</p>
<p>幹校在長治時學生一千二百餘人，現因山中糧食困難，縮小範圍，尙有學生七百餘人，敎職員勤務伙夫等一百七八十人，民中在長治時有學生八百人，現到山裏的有六百人，敎職員等一百餘人。</p>
<p>在隨校時代，我們曾編一個游擊支隊，民大時代又編一個，每個成立時都不足百人，現在經過　年餘戰鬥，已發展為一個團，該團在晉東南常與中央軍配合作數，中央　　為神軍，稱之為生龍活虎。我們到二縱隊時，三縱隊祗有一個團，一年餘時問內，巳發展為六個團，另外有保安游擊隊二個團。</p>
<p>幹校成立後半年中，被訓練出來的學生，已達一千三四白人，民中也有三百人，兩校出來的學生，現在遍佈晉東南和决死二縱隊，幹校敎官，出任各縣縣長，各團團長和政治主任的，有好幾個人。</p>
<p>我們的生活，一天吃二頓飯，我初來時很不慣，多吃肚張，少吃肚餓，一二月後纔習慣，在曹　時生活最苦，吃小米和桃樹葉子，在山交時可以吃到一些白麺，到長治時生活最奢侈，因為學校和外邊交際很多，所以常常吃酒席，酒席和南方的相差不遠，也有大米飯，現在到山裏後，因為經濟和運輸兩感困難，所以改吃小米，菜也彽有羅卜豆付豆芽等物。現在×人還沒來，將來×人來，也許還要困難。</p>
<p>我們是堅持久戰，堅持華北抗戰的，我們是堅决留在淪陷區域、堅决留在×人後方的、這個任務是一個偉大的任務，但這工作是一個艱苦的工作，我們决不怕艱苦，我們要為保衛中華民族，保衛世界和乎流最後一滴血。</p>
<p>我已經拋棄了我的家，我巳經忘掉了家裏的人，我很少給家裏去信，戰爭改變了一切，各幹各的，誰也照顧不了誰，將來趕走日本帝國主義後，幸而留得此身，再說他話，不幸在戰爭未結束前犧牲了，就什麼都完了。</p>

<p>廣西學生軍於前年十二月一日，由桂林整隊出發，沿途經過全州、衡陽、長沙、武漢、六安、霍山等地、民衆均熱烈歡迎，他們便乘機會做些宣傳工作。皖西立煌縣，當時是五路軍的一個根據地，現在是發動豫鄂皖邊區游擊隊的中心地，他們在那里曾用簡明扼要的傳單，把四山盤踞多年的股　領導人請來談判，以大義說服他們，集中所部四五千人，出山改編，統歸廖磊將軍指揮作戰。</p>
<p>保衛大武漢內圈抗戰火線，漸衛由大縮小，該軍有一中隊被派希水工作，見全城建築物，炸得體無完　，老百姓非死卽逃，城中巳呈「空空如也」的景象。他們便去四鄉開展工作，在實際經驗中，發現一種不良的現象，演劇助大家　攏來看，演講便四教而走，後來又家喻戶蟯的去登門造肪，作個別談話式的宣傳，使大家澈底曉然於抗戰意義，或中先敎孩童歌詠入手，以作聯絡大人感情的媒介，結果，終于把他們組織起來，盡　帶助大軍作戰。</p>
<p>武漢作有計劃的退却時，他們夜行軍經過　　湖，曾被×砲衝散，至荊門集中，僅少一人，後來探得，他是和掩護隊另走他路去了。這回有一段路，一運走了兩夜一大半天，僅得吃了一餐飯。他們囘憶起來，還說怪有趣呢—抵荊門正對民衆宣傳，突被×機襲擊，不幸炸死女生二人，傷一人，不勝惋惜之至</p>
<p>據李素珍女士說：在大都市做婦女工作的因難問題，有時尙較鄉村為甚。去年武漢開反侵略大會時，她們先去各家宣傳，請婦女踴躍參加。不料有很多嬌貴的太太小姐，認為她們以「兵大哥」（實際應稱為「兵大姐」）的資格，去向她們（太太小姐）攀談，似乎有點够不上。尤其她們正與高采烈，打着麻將的時候，竟假意抓一把錫子給她們，叫她把主別家走走—然而這隊女學生軍并不生氣，依然苦口婆心地喚醒她們，將抓把銅子給她們的慷慨心，發揚光大起來，也好走向献金台前，大顯救國身手。到了大會日期，凡宣傳過的太太小姐，窮苦婦女，無有小踴躍參加。散會時天巳大黑，又拿火把分頭送她們囘家，有些深被感動的，竟請求要和她們一道去工作。</p>
<p>目前該隊在隨棗一帶工作，也非常會適應環境。如需要夜中演戲，貿不到火油，使用柴油；　不着現成劇台，使就地開幕。總之，只要能達到宣傳目的，使民衆了解抗戰意義是如何，軍隊紀律是如何就行。他們旣然了解，便會一致起來，更將「全民抗戰」巨輪推向前去。有此農民見他們收拾道具，將往他村工作時，竟含羞似的來問他們：「老鄉—你們準幾時再轉來，我們好準備「打塘」給你們吃—」（鄂北稱打撈塘魚為打塘，是欵待上賓之繼），可見內　鄉民，倒底是同眞敵愾心的中國人，誰設不易將他們發動起來？</p>
<p>該隊何　長為談話作了一個結論，他說：他們從這一年多的戰地服務經驗看來，深知今後爭取戰局上勝利的反攻，第一軍隊中的政治工作，第二各地民衆運動工作，還要史廣泛更深人地將它全盤推動起來。若一時沒訓練出那許多的政工人員，也應把現在富有工作經驗的集團，斟酌分散，派往各地領導着去做，以便收獲少數人能策動多數人的功效。</p>
<h3 id="c20">中國統一的回顧與近況 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 國際反侵略會代表毛那著</p>
<p>中日戰爭的第一年，巳確切發生應有的結果卽實現了中國從來未有的眞正統一。至於以前貌合神離的年代究竟有多少，惟有天　知這。自開戰以釆，不服從中央的命令者只有山　主席轉復渠，巳被軍法處槍次。除此以外，沒有一個重要的個袖投到×人的懷裏，或對於將委員長桀驚不遜。很少的中國人願昨日×的傀儡，參加在北平輿南京成立的臨時政府，或婢滕奴顏供其驅使。甘作散　毒物於中國的媒介，俾日本得利用這般的收、以為犯華的資助。此　少數漢奸，遭一般的　　，聲名狼籍，故不能得些微的擁護，中共有幾位，被愛國的中國人以神速的手腕暗殺了；其他的呢，不惟認賊作父，受日本人的卵冀，遺須受上海租界外國警察的保護，非常可憐。據記者在中國所聞歐美人的意見，都以為此次中日戰爭促進中國團結統一的功效，遠勝於以前二十五年內訌所得的痛苦經驗。</p>
<p>失了沿海沿江富庶各省的一部份，別去了新建華麗的首都南京，離開了中山先生的莊嚴陵園，使中國抵抗日本侵略的意志更加强固。不消說，要抵抗日本，須統一國力，須擁護蔣委昌長。這是大衆的意見，誰也公開地這　講，願效百分之百的忠誠。就是從前不甚贊同集權太過者也如是。當然，有些人究竟內心怎樣想，我們不知道，不過至少在外表上已成　致對日的風氣。這是據個人的見聞所及，殊堪慶幸之處。</p>
<p>此外還有不應忘記者，卽因戰爭而來的需要，使曾在歐美留學的專門人材逐漸增多，使反對抱殘守深　閉固拒守的傳統思想風俗習慣者亦漸有勢力，此輩構成國家獨立解放運動的中心，越來越見他們居於領導的地位，</p>
<p>在一九三二年，蘇科爾斯基於其書的結論裏這樣說：「蔣介石幾乎惟一懂得中國內部最主要的衝突者。此所謂衝突，是指國家主義與共產主義的衝突」。當時著者以為雙方將續演悲劇，無法和解，顯然未預料在一九三五年，斯大林與李米洛夫，乾脆讓第三國際與民治國家的運動合作；他更未預料在一九三六年冬，中國共產黨與蔣委員長言和，成為聖誕節奉獻的禮物；他尤其未預料到如今中國共產黨與國民黨的領袖，戳力同心，並肩抗×，且無因是而來的重大摩擦。一九三八年穴月，記者在漢口，見軍事委員會政治部共黨副主任周恩來先生，他鄭重告訴我：不但共產黨以全力與日本作戰——此事在中國上小學的孩子們也知道——亚且最高當局本人亦按西安的約言，與他們絕對合作，共禦外侮。</p>
<p>訊者在中國所經城市，到處都見有些從前不贊成在將委員長領導下實現中國的統一者，而今來對我說：他完全擁護大家承認象徵中國抵抗日本的人物。換句話說，即現在與　昔不相同了；中國因日本的侵略而眞作到內部的統一了。</p>
<p>處於這樣的空氣下，誰有破壞國家統一的些微意向，誰有願興侵略者講和的些微嫌疑，便是最大的不名譽。以此加於軍人，軍人受不了。以此加於官吏，官吏受不了；以此加於其他幹政治者，其他的政治人員也受不了。茲試舉一例以為證。</p>
<p>在成那　為我作嚮導者係張伯森先生，他為前山西模範省長，現任西北方面綏靖主任閻上將的秘書與通事。張先生曾與我談及，彼係基督敎徒，不扯謊，故我們對他所述下面的這件事可以相信。什麼事呢？據說有一位中國人自山西到北平，用無綫電廣播一消息，謂當局曾與日本人私自講和。閻上將聞知這樣的誣篾，非常難過。此項謠言，外國報紙會轉述。記者於是徵求張先生的意見，問可否代為否認。當時我親擬一否認的文稿，盡力使其精審，交與張先生並對他說：如上將同意，我使將它發表，無任欣幸。及我返抵巴黎，剛到不久，便接得一封電報，內容是「同意」，署名者柏森。</p>

<p>捷克是亡國了，但是捷克人民是不願做亡國奴隸的，而且捷克多數社會上的領袖也是不願做亡國順民的，因此捷克的救亡運動巳經演為復國運動，正在潛伏的鬥爭中展開。無們不僅在地下，而且在十字街口，在大庭廣衆中，舉行反法西斯反侵略的示成，國歌之聲　　，反德暴動遍地，而捷前總統貝奈斯且巳在美發表廣播演說，準備號召捷人為復國而鬥爭。</p>
<p>但是法西斯侵略者的壓迫，自然會將加倍的嚴厲和殘酷—布格拉十九日電稱，該處被捕及自殺人數日衆，傳被捕者數十人，此等被捕事宜，悉由德國秘密警察執行。卽此簡單的報告，巳可想見捷克民衆今日的復國運動，是如何的艱險困難—</p>
<p>我們深信捷克民業的復國運動是有前途的，因為祗要不願意做奴隸的人羣團結起來英勇堅决的鬥爭，一定可以獲得最後勝利的—然而我們中國同胞，却應以捷人亡國之事，倍加警惕，捷克之亡在於放棄抗戰，屈辱求和，中途妥協，結果經過侵略者半年凖備之後，終不免於最後滅亡—因此我們今天更應堅決反對民族所徒「停止抗戰」『中途主和』的言論行動—我們抗戰已有成就，切勿等待妥協亡國以後冉圖復國！</p>

<p>我們為爭取中華民族的完全的澈底的解放，今日必須加緊粉碎×好毒計陰謀的步驟，主要的是要實行孫中山先生『國內各族一律平等』的民族政策，和抗戰時期的民主政治，以對蒙族開始，加緊團結國內各民族，發動各族潛伏的力量，堅持抗戰建國，爭最共同的自由幸福。</p>
<h3 id="c33">民主？獨裁？　美國的總統 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 董平譯</p>
<p>「讓我提醒你，我是陸海軍的總司令—」潸是，不久以前，羅斯福總統說的話。</p>
<p>最近，又謠傳着，羅斯福總統發表談話：「美國的疆界，現在在法蘭西」。這句話，雖然是脫胎於包　溫當首相時說的：「英國的疆界，現在在萊茵」。但，其在今日的含義，却遠較那時為深長。</p>
<p>只消自羅斯福總統所表現的語氣上去看，我們知道，美國是在凖備應付一個國外戰禍，或一場國內的緊急糾紛。羅斯福總統既兼任着陸海軍總司令。已集軍政大權於一身，自然，在未來的戰爭或糾紛中，他當能担負全責。去忠誠執行他的全部任務。</p>
<p>因此，這樣的美國總統，在歐洲各國的政府中，是找不到一個相等的人物的。有些地方，他眞像個國王；有些地方，他又像個獨裁者；但，有些地方，他的權力，却還及不到英國的首相。</p>
<p>那眞是一件偉大的工作，但也眞是用盡心血的工作。許多年來，雖然常常可以見到，四五個總統夫人，全康康健健的一同活在世上，但，那些卸任的許多總統自己，却很少能福壽延年，坐望他的繼任者的統治。</p>
<p>在平時，美國總統的權力是常常受到限制的，羅斯福總統因為說了句話，受到參讓院軍事委員會的質問，才說出：「談我提醒你，我是陸海軍的總司令」—實在的，在普通的時候，美國總統的權力，也可以說跟法國總統差不多。</p>
<p>但，到危急的時候，他却會集全部權力於一身，自由處理。那時，民主是捎失了，他是一個獨裁者。</p>
<p>大家該還記得，大戰時的威爾遜總統吧—他的語言，就是法律：他的尊嚴，是超人的；他的權力，是無限的。當戰爭終了，他橫渡大西洋去領導和議的時候，他眞像一個天賦無上的美國統治者。</p>
<p>但，結果呢，民主復仇了，把一個它一手所造成的無上人物，再下來。偉大的成爾遜終於在嘲弄和蔑視的空氣中下台了</p>
<p>美國人民付予他們總統的權力是很大的，差不多快等於希特勒與莫索里尼自己去向人民手中攫去的一般。但，那裏面却有一個極大的區別。不論美國總統「獨裁」到怎樣的地步，結果，他終得循照憲法的規定議位的。</p>
<p>總統一年的官俸，是一萬五千鎊。他的工作，計分三部：外交，立法及司法。</p>
<p>第一，總統負責任命駐外國的大使與公使，同時跟英國的國王一樣，也負責接見外國的使節。這是他的外交工作上最簡易的任務。他自國務院——美國的外交部——得到對外各種會議興討論的情形。他可以目動的在外交舞合上，採取主動的姿態。</p>
<p>他可以主張自己的國家應當採行怎樣的外交政策，而且他的這種主張，，力量是很大的——跟民主國家中的國王一般。但，他并不能最後獨自去决定外交政策；因為，如果他要跟那個國家進行交涉，或簽訂一次條約，他非要得到參議院三分之二的擁護不可。參議院是由每州兩個代表而組成的。所以。這便是參議院外交委員會常常流傳報章的原故，總統的一切外交動作，都得向它老實報告的。</p>
<p>原則上講，總統是沒有宣戰權的，那權力是屬於國會；國會是包含參衆兩院；衆院計有代表四百三十五人。但，總統自然可以在折衝外交的時候，把局勢引到非戰爭不可地步，這，美國一八四五年與墨西哥戰爭，便是個例子。威爾遜總統，也是在四面反對聲中，領導美國參加上次大戰的。</p>
<p>現在可以談到立法，在英國，法案是由王上的閣員提交國會討論通過的。在理論上，也算是奉王上的訓示，美國總統可不能這樣做，不論是他自已，或經由他的閣員，都不能提出議案，憲法所允許他的，僅是叫他在國會中，作國家政務的報告或最多，因為局勢的需要，推薦一個議案。</p>
<p>這樣，他怎能為所欲為的行事呢？很簡單的，他可以找一個議員代他把議案提出，自然，總統提案的目的，是要表示明白的。</p>
<p>如果，總統跟國會意見分歧的時候，他可以採用復决權。那是這樣的：舉例說，羅斯福總統不贊成國會通過的一件議案，他可以在議案通過後的十天之內，把該案退囘國會，請求南院復决。除非兩院中，又都能以三分之二的多數通過；否則，不能成為法律。</p>
<p>這種復决權，在民主國家，是相等危險的。許多總統都因為採用這條權力，而倒台了。只有兩個，傑弗生與克來夫蘭是努力採用而成功的。</p>
<p>唯有在不景氣，像羅斯福總統現在的時候，總統的國內權力是不怎樣大的。美國的許多司法和行政權，都是關於州或市的政府的。在今日，失業，貿易困難等等問題，是給羅斯福總統執行國內權力的好機會。</p>
<p>美國的閣員，是由總統任命的，但許多別的官員，却是由參議員委任；不過，他們的工作，仍然是由總毓負責指揮和支付薪体，因此，許多工作，還常常是總統自己去做。這，便是美國行政機構的互相矛盾了。（譯自本港「士蔑西報」）</p>

<p>本港膠鞋原料、泰半來自英國、如樹膠來自南洋英屬、帆布則來自英京、雖其中亦有向本港織造廠家訂購者、但僅少數、而其製品、亦僅在本港方面銷流、且本港膠廠規　　大者有三五家、小者亦有三五家、工人約在五千名以上、其中以女工佔多數、製造方面、以膠鞋為最主、近年亦有製造防毒面具、雨衣、及橡皮艇者、此乃供應我國軍事之用云、</p>

<p>答對一問是十分、答錯零分、並不倒扣、這樣最高分數就是三百三十分了、（內有一問專為女子而設、另一問專為男子而設）自然不是人人都可得判FullMark的、只要你的分數在二百二十五以上、很好、這是上等、你上那兒都會受人歡迎、一百五十至二百二十五是中等、再下便是下等了、若是分數僅在五十之下、可惜、請恕我、你跟機器人似乎沒多大分別呢、</p>

<p>日本人利用電影藝術來麻醉我國的民衆、　武力侵略的政策中、也是一種己定的計劃、我們祇要看到東三省陷之後、電影院就受到日本的統制，所映的影片、可算全部由日本的影片公司供給、無非是映些日滿支親善、一日滿支經濟提携』、和『共同防共』一類含有政治作用的影片、使華人　在不知不覺中被其麻醉、而「八一三」之後、在所有的佔領區域、對於電影、不是加以統制、便是加以嚴厲的檢杳、用心所在、也昭然若揭了、</p>

<p>東方對士葛之聯賽改於星期四日舉行</p>
<p>【本報專訊】不日由菲律濱移師來港比賽的星洲中華足球隊、一行十八人、由沈觀斗領隊、已於本月十二日自星動程、殺奔岷尼拉方面去、</p>
<p>昨閱英文晚報、有一岷尼拉電訊、謂星華隊抵達該處後、於十八日（星期六）首與勁旅聖湯瑪斯大學隊比賽、相爭甚烈、結果三比一星華隊得勝、</p>
<p>這次星華隊征菲、旗開得勝、而且擊敗素構强頑的聖大隊、根據此點、則星華隊實力如何、可想像而知了、</p>
<p>東方體育會的足球隊、日來籌備出征河內及海防之事、甚為積極、並經推舉星報記者陳福榆為領隊、復為增强出征實力起見、邀請聖約瑟球員李安納蘇沙及上海球人許文奎曹秋亭隨軍出發、聽說許曹二氏、本月廿五日以前可抵港、或能趕及加入該隊出席本星期六日之聯賽、與米杜息一决雌雄、蓋該隊對於錦標、尙有希望、若果屆時會得許曹二氏趕及參戰、包管有擊敗米軍的把握、</p>
<p>又該隊對士葛之第二循環賽、曾由總會訂定於明（廿二）日下午五時在杳港會場交鋒、惟昨據該隊隊長李德奇吿訴說、這塲比賽、經徵求總會及士葛的同意、改在廿三日（星期四）舉行、因此、明天甲組聯賽、祇有南華南對聖約瑟一役而巳、並錄本週比賽秩序如下、</p>

<p>公開男子籃球賽、昨晚共有甲乙組三塲舉行、首塲乙組記者對嶺夢、記者因隊員毛子明馬兆華程寶琦等停賽、未能參戰、實力頓受影響、上半場卽以八比卅二見負、下半場努力反攻、蕭殿簾迭建奇功、惜因前節負球過多、結果仍以廿九比四十三敗北、次場甲組星島對鐘聲、前者為連膺數屆盟主之靑年會隊之化身、數年來未曾敗北、後者亦為甲組之勁旅、擁有名將陳汝正、張仁聲、蘇伯輝、郭楠鴻、李垣芬、沈瑞慶等、實力亦甚雄厚、雖該隊前日初次出師、以四十五比四十九為南華所敗、豈料昨晚發奮為雄、竟將星島擊破、該隊之勝、實非伴致、論功行賞、主將陳汝正實居其首、場邊側射、百發百中、允稱絕技、沈瑞慶截奪傳交、已得個中三昧、惜射球尙欠鎮靜、究未達爐火純青之候、張仁發雖年華老去、但技術仍未盡失、餘如郭植鴻之進攻、李垣芬蘇伯輝之守土、各有其方、星島以戴福成之强攻暗襲、梁國鐸潘堯君之力拒來軍、均有精彩之演出、惟名將鐘志强、則表演失常、每應勝而不勝、失却不少良機、總之、鐘聲此勝之最大原因、乃採取慢攻戰略、運用得宜、而將星島高速率之五人攻守法、實行擊破、遂造成此次勝利、</p>
<p>雙方交鋒後、星島卽取攻勢、戴福成射罰均吿中的、遂以七比〇佔先、銅後鐘聲反攻、陳汝正郭植鴻如脫區之馬、先後破關、八比八打成平手、巳而鍾志强加入作戰、鐘聲攻勢反强、郭植鴻陳汝正銳不可當、續分駕乎星島之上、先後以十四比十及二十比十佔優勝局面、上半塲吿終、鐘聲以廿四比十五領先、下半場開球後、星島潘堯君加入、聲勢為之一振、與戴個成互相暹威、故此時績分、曾演成廿一比廿八、及卅比廿三之局、及至鐘聲郭植鳴四次犯規出塲、情形極度緊張、嗣後陳汝正、沈瑞慶又吿活動、星島雖得回數次罰球、惟無補於事、難以挽囘大勢、戰事吿終、卒以卅三比卅八為鐘聲所克服</p>

<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>【本報特訊】在去月本刊裏大家對于「早操的效能」、已得到一個概要的認識了、我相信大家讀過這編之後、必會發出了一個究竟早操效能的範圍怎樣呢、可以帮助發育嗎、增加壽命嗎………的疑問、請大家不要忙急、待我儘地的介紹、俾大家得到一個澈底的認識、與中心的信仰、而午切實地去實行、這就是我誠懇地盼望、現就其要者分述如下、</p>
<p>（一）養成早起的習慣</p>
<p>古諺云：「一生之計在子勤、一日之計在于晨」早起、當然是一個良好習慣、我們能够有恒的實行早操、當然連帶的也可以養成早起的習慣、因為早操必有時間性的限制——在淸晨的舉行、若沒有時間性的、而任意的話、都不必稱做早操、祇說普通操就够了、故此有恒於早操的人們、都先先養成了早起的好習慣、</p>
<p>（二）有恢復疲勞的效能</p>
<p>和緩的運動、能够恢復疲勞、無論那一個體育家都承認的、不過在早操力面的成效、更覺得是顯著、我們經過整天的工作或過度的運動、都令到我們的身心疲乏得很、雖經過夜裏八小時的休息、到底也不能完全把身心的疲勞恢復、或睡眠通久了、還史覺得疲勞增加、若能够利用淸晨的時間去運動、運動後卽覺得突然的精神奕奕、身心愉快、這是本人的經驗、亦經過很多人的測驗是最可靠的實效、究其原因甚簡、大概因為運動後的身體、體溫增高、呼吸及血液循環加速、致把各部份的疲勞素排于體外的緣故、</p>
<p>未完</p>
<h3 id="c68">昨日網球賽　芬渣　洪惠釗組苦戰敗北　今日有單打三場舉行 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>

<h3 id="c70">在籃球訓練期中　指導者應有的任務 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 羅夏</p>
<p>【本報特訊】一隊優秀的籃球隊、非一朝一夕可訓練得來的、流了多少的血汗、歷盡了幾許艱難辛苦和費耗了幾許時間的努力、然後可以獲得美滿的成績、這成功的收穫、大部份在一個賢明的指導者敎練出來、為指導者當前的任務、首先要注意到編配一個適當的時間去訓練和選擇一種標準合法的敎材去實施、</p>
<p>在訓練明中、指導者要注意到的、是認識每個球員的道德品性和了解每個球員的技術優劣、尤其最要緊的該利用一種紀錄方法來測驗每個球員在每次練習中成績進退和程度高低、這點是指導者在訓練期中最主要的任務、現在把這假定的紀錄表抄錄下面、</p>
<p>我們仔細看消楚這圖表、就可以分別得出每個球員不同之點、在平常練習中、是不能表現出來、因此、指導者可以利用這圖表來檢察你自己的球員進步和技能的詳細統計、然後下一個標準評定來實施持別的指導、帮助他們得着快捷的成功、造就優秀的人材、這是很有價値的、</p>
<p>照表上的結果、張宗厚從埸的左方射球、比右方正確、尤其是在籃的前方更為熟練、反之、李有文從右方射籃比左方準確、陳明生在遠射時、各方面都有弱點、但在靠近籃的右邊、還射得尙好、</p>
<p>照這結果來看，若使張宗厚任右鋒、李有文任左鋒、那就形成一大錯、同時令陳明生任奔走後衛（Rinnihg　Guasa）而施行遠射、也是同一錯誤、陳是最好使他任隨從擲籃之人（Follow　Up　man）、並且他接板上反射下來的球和立罰球線之內而行投射、尤為穩當、</p>
<p>從這幾方面證明、我們就知道這記錄表的重要性、球員本身上的優劣、可在這表上一目瞭然、更兼在一個賢明的指導者加以敎導和批評下、那就曾得着相當的成功、同時在訓練期中、指導者唯一的任務、該利用這表將每個球員的技能淸楚點記錄下來、每次得着一個檢驗、就每次都覺進步了、</p>

<p>— 呂覺良譯</p>
<p>——各國世界語者幾個信片</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>全面抗戰把中國的世界語運動向來所遭受的壓力，解除了。大部分的世界語者馬上站在國際宣傳的崗位上，參加全面抗戰的工作。</p>
<p>抗戰以前集中在上海出版的所有中國世界語刊物，都因上海的撤退而停刊；抗戰開展之後，先後有「新階段」（香港和廣州的世界語者聯合出版的），「遠東使奢」（由上海南京來港的世界語者幹的），「東方呼聲」（漢口）的輩出，它們在呼　與報導各方面，替解放鬥爭着的祖國出過很大的力量，後廣州棄守來「正義」（「新階段」的後身】，也就停了：「東方呼聲」在武澳未失陷前便遷來香港出版，它現在還和「遠東者」在同一大目標之下分頭苦幹着。</p>
<p>每一個中國的世界語者都知道，宣傳工作並不止于消極方面在刊物上報道戰情和暴露×人惡行，同時還要積極地從事和各國的世界語者携手——取得親切的聯絡。所以各個世界語刊都還保持着很大的通訊關係，向時也收到不少的各國世界語者和團體向我們的最高領袖與英勇的士兵給予大大的欽敬與慰籍的書信。</p>
<p>下面所發表的是各國世界語者寄給一遠東使者」的編者轉致中國士兵的數百封慰勞信中的幾個短短的明信片，在這短簡的字裏行間，充滿着世界上的進步人士，對于我們抗戰表示無限的同情與鼓勵。</p>
<p>親愛的，世界語雜誌「遠東使者」的編者：</p>
<p>我們挪威小民埃向你們深致敬禮，我們全體民族眞正地佩服你們中華民族反抗可惡的日本軍閥的自衛戰。對于蔣介石夫婦倆，我們也極表欽敬，因為他倆是最良好的人們。</p>
<p>請把你們的雜誌寄一份給我吧！我打算從貴刊翻譯一些文字，來帮助可憐的中國人作宣傳，挪威同志的最親愛的敬禮——</p>
<p>我們要戰勝可鄙的日本—G．L．約翰生（挪威）</p>
<p>給中國的守土戰士們。同親愛的志：</p>
<p>我們以欽佩和同情的眼光來重視你們的為了民族的解放而反對日本法西斯者的抗戰。我們淸楚地知道，你們這麼幹，不僅給予你們祖國的服務，而且同時對于其他或隱或顯地被殘暴的法西斯所威脅的國家有所效力。</p>
<p>所以我們負欠着你們的債，無論那個應以忠誠的同感來呈現你們。因為你們將會把更豐富的將來捧給你們民族與全人類。</p>
<p>謹致同志的敬禮！</p>
<p>G．P．布魯恩</p>
<p>（在班西人民陣綫中的荷蘭代表）</p>
<p>中國的戰士們：</p>
<p>在九月號的『遠東使者』裏面，我讀過了關於鼓勵中國土兵的那些文章。</p>
<p>像是眞正的柴門霍夫信徒那樣，和平戰士，我希望你們，做你們的正義的衛士吧。上帝會祝福你們，以各種關係來成全你們的志願的。你們對于全人類與世界上眞正的民主國而服務，英勇地為護衛你們的獨立與正義，把專門從事于毀滅文化的野獸驅逐出去吧！</p>
<p>和平與正義萬歲！</p>
<p>柴門霍夫的和平戰土A，奧比爾曼（波蘭）</p>
<p>英勇抗戰的中國士　們：</p>
<p>在我的學校和家庭裏以最大多數的朋友盡都讓嘆你們反抗日本强盜的英勇鬭爭，尤其是我。在敝國阿根廷，人人覺得要協同你們勇敢的中國士兵做維護和平與自由的反法西斯的拳師，同時為了我們，這是必要的。誰是眞正的勝利者呢？我們都深信，它是屬于你們這邊的。在前方的英勇的中團士兵們！我們向你們敬禮！</p>
<p>你的阿根廷朋友孫約根</p>

<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>是的，她終于被父親從學校拖回來。被看管在家里。因此，他對父親不是也曾有過惡感嗎？她說：</p>
<p>『什麽父親？漢奸，』她年靑，她是弱者——被體質，被性各、被生活習慣所决定了的—弱者難以行動表示自己的反抗——　去感情的肓動性以外；結果，也無非是怨言，甚至咒為而巳。不過，她在可能內，仍是設法捐募。知道她的朋友，贊揚他：</p>
<p>『你眞是中國的好女兒』！女僕來綠茶的時候，坦然了些；他的心，彷彿被懸起了，又在向原處墜落。不過，他怕了那個多話的女僕；卽使不由她而引起任何的意外，也難免因為她的多話把無限的時間浪費；所以他迫她拒絕　僕的茶，使女僕沒有進來多話的機會，她不做聲；而且在門外的女僕不肯去，好像在表示着：「讓我進去吧，我有許多許多話，非說不可」。因此，他有些憤怒了，他低聲地說：「你快說，不要茶」！</p>
<p>一個聰明者，在突變中，常不聰明，而且有時候愚蠢。在他看見她用顫抖的手指着自己的喉嚨的時候，才記起她口中被堵塞的手帕。他想：</p>
<p>「你何必這樣怕我！我不殺害你」。但這不是正確的認識，她也不了解自己，她所表現的。並不是把握着什麽革命的觀點而一半是為了愛自己的祖國的概念所驅使——因為人是不允許自己的祖國滅亡的，這己經成為本能，一半是由於自己弱者的個性所驅迫——因為弱者的感情是脆弱的，悲哀與歡快，同樣容易被打動，加以她天性還保持著善良，使她對於別人的苦難——更加接近——不自覺的同情，然而，她對於這新識義勇軍的使者，却投以疑惑的眼光，又寫：</p>
<p>『你就是義勇軍嗎？』</p>
<h3 id="c77">江陰城守記及其他 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>據小說小括云：『江陰城守記，卽荊駝遣史中之一種，而易為通俗小說。』孫楷第『中國通俗小說書目』錄入並註明『未見』。按，遺字當為逸字之誤。小說小話又云：『書中四王八將，皆有姓氏，而稽之別細紀載，幾若亡是公。且國初王之陣亡者，僅有尼堪與孔有德，事在滇粵，不在江陰也。大約所謂王者，係軍中綽號。蘇郡之變，育所謂八大王者，亦其倫也。』</p>
<p>小說小話的作者曾見過『峯遺編』，因為該書第十五囘為『為薙髮激反姑蘇郡　詐拈香襲殺八大王』，所以才引『八大王』來作例證，殊不知就在通俗小說本所根據的方言的城守記（淸韓炎作）裏，就有下列的記載：「損去三王千八將』，（八月）十一日，大淸兵攻北門，七王死之。』『『十二日，大淸兵仍攻北門二都督死之。』「十四日，江陰詐降，薛王死之。」二十九日，大淸陽攻南城，十王死之。一據「江上孤忠錄」所云，則另有所謂八王者，於八月十二日，觸銃而死，其他諸王之死，與「江陰城守記」記載相同，小說小話的件者於此似稍嫌忽略。</p>
<p>小說小話另行的『雙忠記」（以抵抗元乓的張順張貴為主人翁）「雪窖冰天錄」（阿計替河渡錄的改編）以及「采石戰記」（以虞允文戰功為主），與「江陰城守記」一樣，部是我所嚮往而亟欲一讀的小說，可惜似乎都巳失傳了。</p>
<p>因講到江陰城失守之便，使我想起『江陰義民別傳』，我有一位朋友讀過別傳以後說道：</p>
<p>「只要百姓人人都肯抵抗，國家絕對不會亡於異族之手—人人都肯抵抗，則政治的腐敗不會發生，任何邪說都成不入耳之談，當然不會有漢奸，並且格外會引起國際間的同情，而獲得援助。百姓的力量是大的，遠　出任何力量之上。不信，我們就可以看明末江陰百姓的抵抗滿淸，他們以彈丸之地，烏合之衆，抵抗滿淸數十萬大兵，至八十三天之久，而與以重創。不信，我們也可以看看現在山西和河北一帶，游擊戰的成績，他們究竟給了日軍以怎樣的打擊。</p>
<p>「我希望閱讀本書的人，有這樣一個想象：淸兵和韃子就是今日的什麽？劉良佐就是愧儡政府的漢奸，七王和二都督之流，就是什們的江陰，是國內任何縣市，許用是我們現代學校裏的學生，高瑞和徐玉揚是我們老兒是我們日常所見的機匠和小工：程聖和何氏兄弟是我們都市間作着一般買賣商人。遭裏所寫的一切戰爭，，就是現代的戰爭。×人的兇殘，我們的奮鬥，也都是眼前的事實。我更希望我門同胞，人人有作許用以至陳二郎和黃毓祺的决心。而我們的賢明長官，人人會有　陳二典史的智勇和忠烈，從前江陰的終於失敗，不足為奇，因為那時並沒有第二個江陰，現在我們處處就是那時的江陰，我們决不會失敗，因此，我們自不必因從前江陰的失敗而喪氣，却反要因其失敗，而激發我們的同仇之心，這樣，我們便一定會成功，來報復我們的國仇』，</p>
<p>因為他的話是很警闢，所以鈔在這裏，以便讀者參閱。</p>

<p>— 蕭雯</p>
<p>這是一幅人物的素描，故事的斷片，是挺小時候的鄰居的實事。在陌生地方住上好幾個年頭的，離現在再過三年，經是廿年了，孩子時代記憶力有點淡，有點含糊，是件遺憾，不曾看完一齣傳奇，在適當的機　裏。</p>
<p>故事裏，先該提起三　出場的脚色，第一個是『公公』，第二個是『痴子』，第三個是『雷元』，他們有着份親，是同一個『杭』姓，倘若以年齡來計算，公公是個五十開外的人，痴子和雷元全是二三十歲。也有人說痴子比雷元大得多。據說論輩份，痴子該是最前輩，他們吃的產業，全是他名下的，當地一般人也纏不淸楚杭姓的身世，他們原是外鄉人，移居在這長的。反正這筆賬姓杭的肚裏明白：也沒有人理會閒事，究竟他們的實在。</p>
<p>公公是做過一點兒芝蔴官的，是個戴過頂子正經人。痴子祗是痴子，從小到現在，而至將來。雷元是個浪蕩子，敗家精，一股流氓的無賴。三个不同類的角色，混在一起，於是展開了傳奇式的故事。</p>
<p>雷元吃着玩着不做事，弔而郎當的，好在家裏還能養活一個閒人，有點零錢到街上去化，不妨礙家裏的事。他的生活：賭博，鬧閑，遊蕩下流勾當，他的本領：曾一次連吃七碗光麵，肚子不叫僥。自己放了火，會陷害鄰居，有份粗氣力，叫人害怕他的無賴。可是他不敢去向痴子挑戰，這是冒險，不是對手，沒半句話，一帖藥，就是在力氣上也不是痴子的敵手，痴子有的是股痴勁，流血與生死也有點麻木。</p>
<p>「毒蚊咬毒蛇，以毒攻毒」。一般人的說法原沒有半點不是。</p>
<p>痴子喫着呆着，一座泥菩薩站在山門口，看人看天看門，像隻守門的狗，對陌生人他有份認眞。他沒有生活，沒有故事，有時候帶份滑稽的天眞，每天不是笑也不像哭的呆着。是早已成年了，但夜裏還是每天遺尿在床上，像大小的孩子，白大有時候也是如此，這是他自癡的原因，事情大慣常了，誰也不理會他，預備一間小　子，讓他伏在裏面，尿浸的枕頭，尿浸的被褥，尿浸的方磚，尿浸的床木，像一隻豬仔，偶然善心的老婆婆，把尿浸的被褥晒在太陽裏，小院子全是尿氣了。如果是有人觸犯了他，卽使是自已人也不認識，彷彿是匹　馬，誰也不敢去招架他，祇有請公公露一露面，高聲罵幾句，他會像小孩子給母親實罰着一樣，不敢出聲，俏悄地溜走了。</p>
<p>「做官的，頭上有三昧火的，正能克歪」一般人的說法原沒有半點不是。</p>
<p>公公這一位許多人會介紹給你的老世故客也許他曾有一個經壓豐富的黃金時代，現正在退居在家理。住在小樓上，讀黏書，弄得聞食，過着休養的老人生活，是怪淸閒的，他的三昧嚇住了痴子，可不是雷元的對手，雷元使勁的時候，不敢碰他一根汗毛，一個無賴，甚麽也不理會，他也不管老幼，一味蠻幹，下辣手，老年人萬事小心眼地，縱是前輩，還是不吃眼前虧的好。</p>
<p>「這是杭家祖墳上的風水」。一般人的說法原沒有半點不是。</p>
<p>三位豪客，有不可磨沒的不同的个性，混在一起，互相克制，轉个循環，時時會有好戲文表演給鄰居看，慣常之後，有點平淡，但是孩子們還是很高興的呢，我也是一个，有點害怕，有點好奇的偷看着。「杭家雖則出了一個敗子，還是好的一份人家，那全是靠痴子一人的福份，若是痴子一死，若是痴子一死了。」一般人的說法原沒半點不是。</p>
<p>當我走離這裏的時候，公公也不死，痴子也不死，雷元也不死，全都安靜地，沒一點風波，老樣子，一幅循環不變的圖畫。</p>
<p>因此，我的故事也沒有尾巴了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Great Unity of Democratic Nations: An Important Task for Our Country Today <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Following the German aggressors' annexation of the Czech Republic, the European situation has become increasingly tense, serious, and critical. Observers familiar with the international situation have unanimously pointed out that Hitler will take advantage of this invincible momentum to actively prepare for further aggression. According to yesterday's telegram, the Fascist troops that "conquered" the Czech Republic have already left Prague and are heading east, threatening Romania and Yugoslavia as targets of plunder. At the same time, they have firmly rejected the protests of the former British and French governments regarding the Czech events, and have presented Romania with an economic plunder "ultimatum." As a result, the situation has become increasingly dangerous, with the cloud of war spreading across Europe. Newspapers in various countries have published news about Hitler's further conspiracies to invade. Even the London newspapers, including The Times, which usually sang praises under Chamberlain's policy that "the European situation is much clearer than last year," have unanimously pointed out that the desires of Fascist aggressors led by Hitler and Mussolini are insatiable. Once they succeed in one step, they immediately take a second step of aggression. It is particularly noteworthy that the German aggressors' target today is not the Soviet Union, a bulwark of peace with strong defenses, but Southeast Europe, attempting to create a Third Reich in the Mediterranean and Central Europe! This shows that the aggressors' ambitions are no longer limited to redistributing colonies, but to re-dividing Europe and re-dividing the world. After conquering several intermediary countries and small nations one after another, their sharp blades will be directed at the capitalist democracies that have indulged or assisted the aggressors through appeasement policies! At the same time, what we cannot ignore is that those rampant in Europe today are not naturally ambitious despots and villains, but there is the existence of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo "triangle" alliance. Although there are still many contradictions between them, they are closely linked and act in unison on the entire path of aggression! Today, as German aggressors advance east and south from the Czech Republic, Italian aggressors are also coveting the region between Europe and Africa, especially encircling France step by step, eager to dissect it. Meanwhile, Japanese aggressors are dramatically launching new offensives in the Far East, feigning preparations for war against the Soviet Union but actually advancing southwest. This kind of collaboration among international Fascist aggressors to prevent democratic countries from attending to both the East and West while engaging in plunder and division is now an accomplished fact. We have repeatedly exposed the new conspiracies and new offensives of Fascist aggressors. What should be pointed out today is that the active development of these conspiracies and offensives has made democratic and peaceful countries painfully aware of the seriousness of the threat they face, and naturally also poses a considerable threat to our cause of resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>Under this serious threat, the question of the great unity of democratic and peaceful countries, and the question of the consolidation and expansion of the peace front, have been solemnly and urgently raised. Therefore, in the past few days, in the midst of dark clouds on the international stage, there have surprisingly been sparks illuminating the future of light and victory. Particularly noteworthy is, firstly, the tendency of Britain and France to abandon appeasement diplomacy and adopt active steps to resist Fascist aggressors. This is concretely manifested in the British and French governments' protest to Germany regarding the Czech events, the recall of the British and French ambassadors to Germany, the simultaneous declaration by the British and French governments that they will never recognize Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic, the preparations of the British and French governments for cooperation in resisting Fascist aggressors, especially the British Cabinet's decision on the 18th to immediately maintain close contact with all peace-loving countries around the world, the British government's preparation to move from economic cooperation to political cooperation with the Soviet Union, and the French President's scheduled visit to the United States to meet with Roosevelt to discuss the issue of uniting democratic countries. Secondly, the United States' policy of uniting with democratic countries to oppose Fascist aggression and defend world peace has become more resolute and progressive. This is concretely manifested in President Roosevelt's severe condemnation of Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic and his loud call for cooperation among democratic countries, the U.S. government's formal delivery of a diplomatic note condemning Germany's illegal atrocities, the U.S. Treasury Department's abolition of the U.S.-Czech agreement and implementation of economic sanctions against Germany, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman's proposal to abolish the Neutrality Act, the decline in the momentum of all opposition factions, and the rise of the people's anti-Fascist united front. Thirdly, Romania, which is about to be invaded, has followed Spain and our country in deciding to offer the aggressors a death-defying and sustained resistance to defend its national sovereignty and territory. This is concretely manifested in the Romanian government's rejection of the German ultimatum, the Romanian government's adoption of defensive measures, ordering the mobilization of 500,000 people to prepare for the crisis, especially the Romanian King's expression to the British government that if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are willing to provide assistance, he can unite Poland, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and other countries to resolutely confront the aggressors. In addition, the Soviet Union, which is holding the 18th Congress of the Communist Party to prepare for defending the socialist motherland and safeguarding the independence of all nations and world peace, issued a note to the German government on the 19th by Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov, declaring that the Soviet Union will never recognize Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic. At the same time, the Soviet ambassador to Britain has been consulting with the French and American envoys and British diplomatic authorities for several days, preparing to deal with the aggressors' adventurous attacks.</p>
<p>When we see this news, we can first see that the Fascist aggressors' mad adventures are irreversible, and there is no possibility of compromise with them. This proves that all pro-peace arguments that attempt to compromise with Fascist aggressors in the name of "anti-communism" and "anti-Sovietism" are baseless. In fact, they are still criminal acts of helping the aggressors and robbers to commit evil, betraying the nation, and destroying democracy! Secondly, the fact that democratic and peaceful countries have begun to actively move towards the road of unity proves that all pessimists about the peace front are baseless, proves that all malicious slanders against the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy are baseless, and at the same time proves that all shameless arguments that denigrate our country's national policy of uniting democratic and peaceful countries to jointly resist aggression are also baseless! However, we must still pay attention here, and we must guard against frivolous, pointless, and irresponsible optimistic tendencies! We must more deeply recognize the growing maturity of the possibility of a great alliance of democratic countries and the inevitable trend of consolidating and expanding the peace front. However, at the same time, we should also note that the contradictions between democratic countries are still developing, and the obstacles to the future of the peace front and external attacks are still extremely serious. All erroneous concepts about the union of democratic countries and the peace front are still seriously present. Therefore, on the one hand, we must accelerate the great unity of democratic countries and intensify the consolidation and expansion of the peace front in order to increase the momentum of the struggle for resistance and national construction. However, to complete this task, we urgently need not only the general mobilization of national diplomacy, the general mobilization of international propaganda, and the general mobilization of the anti-Fascist struggle of the peoples of democratic countries, aggressive countries, and all oppressed countries, but also the strengthening of the unity of all ethnic groups, all parties, and all classes in our country, resolutely supporting the protracted war of resistance, and accelerating progress in military, economic, and political affairs, especially by quickly establishing people's organizations across the country and provincial and county councils, and using the facts of our implementation of democratic politics in the war of resistance to welcome the great unity of democratic countries around the world.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Jiangnan is Mobilizing: The Three People's Principles Youth League is Forming Branches, and Farmers' Organizations are Calling for General Mobilization of Farmers <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondence) The Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League recently issued a declaration stating that the Three People's Principles Youth League is the only emerging revolutionary organization and has been unanimously recognized by the whole country. This is the inevitable result of the development of Chinese history and the requirements of the current stage of the Chinese revolution: First, it is necessary to concentrate revolutionary forces and strive for the final victory in the War of Resistance. Second, it is necessary to mobilize revolutionary forces and build a new foundation for a new China based on the Three People's Principles. Third, it is necessary to cultivate new and continuously revolutionary new forces. The Three People's Principles Youth League was born to meet this need, and its significance and mission are indescribable. The Central Headquarters of the Three People's Principles Youth League intends to launch new revolutionary work in the Jiangnan area, and has specially established the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Branch to accelerate the organization of lower-level teams in order to lay a new revolutionary foundation.</p>
<p>After three months of active preparation by the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Branch, lower-level teams from the Beijing-Shanghai area to the anti-Japanese area have been established one after another. Especially in Shanghai, in an extremely bad environment and under the darkness of dark forces, the revolutionary forces have successfully shown a thriving atmosphere and have invisibly become the main force of resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>However, the Jiangnan area, under the oppression of the × people, has formed an entire dark world, and all reactionary forces have taken the opportunity to extend themselves. Not only are the remnants of feudalism using the name of revolutionary forces to spread rumors and rob, but also Japanese imperialism is cleverly using the name of revolutionary forces to mix fish eyes with pearls and destroy the Chinese revolution. This is something we hate very much. Now, in addition to actively stepping up our work to suppress all reactionary attempts through work, we hope that the authorities from all walks of life will strictly guard against and severely crack down on them, unite under the banner of the Three People's Principles, and jointly recognize the development of revolutionary forces.</p>
<p>Although the Jiangnan Branch has only had a short three months of preparation time, it has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, giving us many conveniences in our work. This is something we are very excited and grateful for. We should redouble our efforts with a spirit of arduous revolution in order to quickly develop the league's affairs and spread the new life of the revolution throughout Jiangnan.</p>
<p>The 14th was the morning publicity day for the second phase of the Shanghai War of Resistance First Publicity Week. Shanghai farmers' organizations issued a letter to all compatriots in the agricultural sector, which is copied as follows: Dear friends in the city, Chinese farmers are the most revolutionary. In history, most of those who resisted oppression and raised the banner of rebellion were farmers. In China's War of Resistance against Japan, farmers are of course a main force. Just look at the soldiers currently fighting on the front lines, most of them come from the fields, and those who are constantly replenishing them are also the people. In terms of supplementing the army in the later stage of the War of Resistance, since farmers are the main body, then in the occupied areas, farmers are the only basic force for recovering old land. The bloody battle of Songhu for four months the year before last aroused the enthusiasm of farmers in the city to resist Japan and save the country. Everyone abandoned their hoes and either joined the army to splash the × people with hot blood, or organized wartime service teams to transport weapons, military rations, intelligence, and build fortifications. Even ordinary women have automatically shouldered the task of cooking and comforting the army. The artillery fire of × can destroy our fields, but it cannot destroy our determination to resist the war. On the contrary, the more intense the artillery fire of × people's invasion, the higher our enthusiasm for resisting ×. Even though Shanghai has fallen, our farmer friends have always guarded every inch of land left by our ancestors and waged the most arduous and heroic struggle. However, after carefully reviewing our past efforts, although we have made considerable achievements, we still feel that it is not enough. We must know that at this critical moment of national life and death, the people of the whole country should show a performance that transcends all historical precedents in their contributions to the country. On the negative side, we should endure all the hardships that ordinary people cannot endure. On the positive side, we should give full play to our highest potential strength and negotiate with ×× to the end. Now, I list five things as the common goals of our agricultural compatriots: First, participate in guerrilla warfare. From one village to one village, to one township to one town, and even to one district to one county, all those in their prime should gather together to form guerrilla teams. The tasks of the guerrilla team are approximately: First, attack the × people by surprise. Second, eradicate traitors. Third, protect production and its circulation. Fourth, strengthen political training. Second, engage in production. Farmers in areas within the guerrilla zone that are not controlled by the × people must not give up farming in addition to engaging in guerrilla work in order to maintain the supply of long-term operations. Third, non-cooperation movement with × people and traitors. In terms of economics, we should adopt a non-cooperation doctrine. One, refuse to use counterfeit currency. Second, refuse to pay taxes. Third, never use manpower or material resources to support ×. Fourth, refuse the infiltration of × goods into the guerrilla zone. Fourth, follow government orders. Farmers should absolutely follow the orders of the administrative organs established by the government in the guerrilla zone in order to consolidate the power of resistance and national construction. Fifth, vigorously implement the general mobilization of the national spirit. The general mobilization program of the national spirit and its implementation measures recently promulgated by Chairman Chiang should be earnestly followed in order to achieve the highest goal of national construction based on the Three People's Principles. The above five points are all urgent tasks for our farmer friends today. In order to defend our homeland, in order to strive for the independence, freedom, equality, and peace of our nation, we must follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and swear to fight the × people to the death. Shanghai is the general station in the rear. We not only will not allow them to take the system, but also want to fundamentally take it back.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Roar of the Ancient City <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu, this ancient city without running water, no public buses, with roads that are narrow streets and alleys, and shops that are all wooden bungalows, except for "citizens must obey the orders of the air defense headquarters and the guidance of air defense personnel", "everyone should contribute money and effort to quickly complete the city's air defense construction", "without air defense equipment, everyone's life and property cannot be guaranteed", "families should prepare more sandbags to prevent incendiary bombs", "each family should set up more water tanks to store water for firefighting", and other air defense slogans, and sandbags piled up at various important intersections, with a military policeman stationed there, is just like many other rear cities. Not tense enough, the wartime atmosphere is not strong enough. The impact of the War of Resistance on Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan Province, only began a few months ago.</p>
<p>However, this ancient city is now beginning to roar.</p>
<p>The Chengdu cultural circles launched a "Military Building Movement Propaganda Week". This propaganda week started on the 5th and ended on the 11th.</p>
<p>On the first day, March 5th, from morning, every big and small shop in the city raised the national flag. Seeing this solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere, one cannot help but be moved. At one o'clock in the afternoon, a singing assembly was first held in Shaocheng Park. At the entrance of the assembly site, a large horizontal banner with white characters on a black background was hung, reading "Sichuan has a vast land and a large population. The army must be a national model." Beside the entrance, a statue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, twelve feet high, made of bamboo strips and paper, raised an iron hand, with the words "Rise up, those who do not want to be slaves!" written on the arm. Inside was a large square that was crowded with plain male and female students and common people wearing blue cloth clothes. First, the Central Military Academy Military Rong team performed Qin's "Turkish March", followed by the Tianming, Amateur, Telecommunications, Youth Association and other four singing groups singing the "Military Building Song" in four parts, the Political Department of the Aviation Committee, the Divine Eagle Troupe singing "The Divine Eagle Song", "Building a Large Air Force", the Military Academy New Students singing "Triumphal Song", the Telecommunications Singing Troupe singing "We Want War", and the War Zone Children's Border Propaganda Troupe singing "Wandering Children" and "Refugee March", "Youth March". When they sang "We grew up in artillery fire... The Japanese warlords' artillery fire has forged us into revolutionaries. We are not afraid of lacking anything, we will take it from Japanese imperialism. One day, one day, we will fight back to our old home", tens of thousands of people were simply moved and excited to tears. Finally, tens of thousands of people in the entire assembly sang together "Sacrifice Has Reached the Final Moment", "National Salvation Army Song", "Volunteer Army March" and other songs. The magnificent and impassioned singing shook the clouds in the sky, and the Japanese warlords hiding in Tokyo also felt chilled and exclaimed: "Chinese people's spirit cannot be insulted!"</p>
<p>After the singing assembly ended, from three o'clock, there was an aviation performance. Two teams of planes flew in from the east, roaring wildly in the city sky for a while, and then began to practice throwing bombs, sometimes flying up, sometimes descending, and sometimes somersaulting. The citizens heard the strange cry of "Gu Gu" and stood on the street with their hands covering their eyes and looking up, knowing that it was their own plane performing. Thunderous applause rose from the streets and alleys, and everyone felt the great victory of the Lanzhou air battle in their hearts. After a while, the plane dropped countless leaflets, flying red and green all over the sky, like falling flowers, which was extremely beautiful. After a while, the leaflets fell to the ground, and the citizens scrambled to pick them up and read them. They were "Building a National Army to Overthrow Japanese Warlords", "Building a National Army to Protect the People", "Everyone Should Enlist in the Army, Victory in the War of Resistance is Certain", "Everyone Should Contribute to Building the Country is Certain", "A Good Soldier is a Model for a Good Citizen, and a Good Citizen is the Foundation for a Good Soldier", "A Great Man Joins the Army to Serve the Country, and a Good Man Dedicates His Life to the Battlefield", "Good Iron Can Be Used to Make Nails, and Good Men Should Be Soldiers", "A Brave Man Should Learn from Yue Wu Mu's Loyalty to the Country, and a Daughter Must Know That Qin Liangyu Joined the Army to Kill ×", "Qi Jiguang's Meritorious Service in Defending Against Bandits Will Last for Generations, and Hua Mulan's Name Will Be Known Throughout the Ages" and other slogans that most encouraged people to enthusiastically serve in the military.</p>
<p>At five o'clock in the evening, the third program - the beginning of the lantern parade - began. Before five o'clock, various agencies and groups arrived at the venue one after another, with a total of nearly one hundred units and more than 40,000 people. The meeting started at five o'clock, presided over by Huang Lilu, director of the provincial party headquarters, who said briefly: "In order to resist aggression and uphold world peace, our country must build a great national defense army in order to win the final victory in the War of Resistance against Japan. We Chinese have people, and for every Chinese, at least one Japanese can be beaten, but if we are a pile of loose sand, one Japanese can enslave seven Chinese. Therefore, our country must be militarized throughout the country, and everyone must be a national defense army, and Japan will have no choice but to fail..." These words pricked the hearts of the audience word by word, and everyone responded to him with thunderous applause. Afterwards, Dr. Yao Le, a leader of the Xinjiang Hui people, gave a speech on the meaning of "China is a whole nation, the Han people are working hard to build an army, smash the × people, and revive China", which won the crowd's cheers and thunderous applause. Immediately afterwards, six proposals were passed, and the lantern parade began. The fire was lit on the rostrum, and the people below followed suit and lit the lanterns in their hands. The lanterns were not ordinary paper lanterns, but War of Resistance lanterns that had been conceived with imagery. There were planes, warships, tanks, artillery, etc., all kinds of ladders, everything that should be there. Among them, the ones that won the most smiles from the citizens and made them deeply reflect were several symbolic lanterns such as "Turtle Lantern", "Snake Eating an Elephant", and "Japanese Emperor Revolving Pot". The "Turtle Lantern" was written with "Those who don't join the army are this", meaning to encourage people to enthusiastically serve in the military. "Snake Eating an Elephant" was a small snake crawling on the body of an elephant, but the snake had no ability to swallow the elephant at all, but was in danger of being trampled to death by the elephant. This symbolized that Japan could not annex China and would eventually be trampled to death by China. The "Japanese Emperor Revolving Pot" was to tie up a urinal, tie up a human body, and consider it the Japanese Emperor, with the upper body thrown into the pot and the lower body left outside. This symbolized that in the first phase of the War of Resistance, Japan had reached the end of its rope and would inevitably fail.</p>
<p>The team started from the Shaocheng Park venue, passed through Xiyu Street, Dongyu Street, Zhongdong Street, Chunxi Road, and Zongfu Street, and disbanded at the Zhongshan Public Group. The citizens knew early on that there would be a lantern parade that night, and most of them ate dinner earlier and squatted at the street to watch the excitement. The crowds were like mountains and seas, and water could not leak through, especially in the prosperous Chunxi Road. The reporter followed the team from the venue to Chunxi Road and was forced to stand at a multi-lens corner of the road and could not pass. Many people stood on the side of the road, unable to see the fire in the center of the road, so they took out bamboo chairs and benches from the store and rode on their feet to watch. Everyone saw the Flying Generals of the Air Force Sergeant School, the cannons and tanks of the Central Military Academy, and the national flag, the Prime Minister's portrait, and Chairman Chiang's portrait, and applauded and cheered enthusiastically. From time to time, the team sang the impassioned "Rise up, those who do not want to be slaves!..." The citizens on the street also sang along loudly. After the singing, they followed and shouted slogans: "Military-Civilian Cooperation, Resist the War to the End!", "Build a National Army and Overthrow Japanese Warlords!", "Long Live the Liberation of the Republic of China!"... After one person in the team shouted, the entire team and the citizens on the side of the road followed along. A Chen's singing and a Chen's slogan shook the northern suburbs in the sky to the point of silence...</p>
<p>It is said that Chengdu has never been so lively.</p>
<p>Now this ancient city, the metropolis of West China, has been awakened by the artillery fire of the War of Resistance and has begun to roar!</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>One is the Center of Resistance, One is a Commercial Hub</p>
<p>Women's Mobilization</p>
<p>The local people's enthusiastic spirit is no less than that of other places. In terms of society, the County Party Department and People's Education Center have established national salvation organizations in various towns, encouraging residents of various towns to actively donate money to save the country. The reporter went to the People's Education Center to inquire. According to them, since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, they have actively organized local people, starting in the urban area, to guide residents on methods of air defense, anti-poisoning, and first aid. Currently, they are still carrying out plans to organize the people, hoping that every person in Lanxi can have sufficient wartime knowledge and the idea of saving the country. At the same time, women's organizations are also quite active. In addition to women's first aid classes, they also plan to train the flower boat girls of Lanxi. Because on the banks of the Lanxi River, there are many flower boats. According to the recent investigation by the county government, there are twenty-one flower boats in the urban area, with ninety boat girls, mostly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. However, among these nineteen boat girls, only five can read, eight have some embroidery skills, and the rest are illiterate and have no skills. Moreover, these boat girls are mostly idle, so there are plans to actively train them so that they can also serve the country. Secondly, in the Northwest Chenglong area of Lanxi (including Shangxi Xiajie Zouqian Beijin Street Xiachang Street, etc.), there are eighty-nine teahouses, all of which employ tea girls to entertain tea guests, totaling one hundred and thirty-two tea girls. Most of these tea girls are between the ages of seventeen and nineteen, so they are also taught first aid knowledge so that they can serve the country. At the same time, most of the boat girls and tea girls are willing to receive this training. This spirit is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Visiting Yongchang</p>
<p>Lanxi has night markets, which are very lively in West Street and other places. Several newly opened foreign goods shops have neon signs. Although it is night, the streets are still very crowded. When the reporter passed the city gate tower, there was a public library set up. He went up to visit, and there were many people reading. There was a large collection of newspapers from various places. On the bookshelf, there were several newly published magazines. There were also newspapers published locally in Lanxi, which were similar in content and format to the Jinsheng Daily in Jinhua. The total population of Lanxi County is 52,225. In the county's 993 townships, training is organized by district. "Yongchang is a military town in Lanxi. The reporter took a bus across the river to visit once. The journey took about sixty minutes. After getting off the bus, there was a winding rural road, and further in was a lively cross street. The town looked quite neat, with large shops on both sides. The town hall was found on the street, and the reporter went in to interview. According to the local mayor, "The rules for recruiting able-bodied men in this town are very strict. Regardless of rich or poor households, all those of able-bodied age must be sent for training, and no substitutes can be hired or deliberately delayed. In this time of national crisis, our cadres absolutely should not be careless. Otherwise, we would be letting the country down. A large number of able-bodied men in this town have already received training. As for the people's national salvation ideas, they are very high, so they are willing to donate money to subscribe to public bonds." In a town in the interior, it is admirable that they can have such a spirit.</p>
<p>Impressions of this Trip</p>
<p>In summary, this simple outline is enough to show that today's Eastern Zhejiang, although in the rear of the military, its entire organization still maintains a very sound structure. The economy, politics, and people's organizations in various places are all on the road to progress. We know that to achieve final victory, we need a solid front line, but also a stable rear. Today, the soundness of social organizations and the intensity of public sentiment in various parts of the Chinese rear are a clear symbol of achieving final victory. (End)</p>

<p>— Yan You</p>
<p>A Letter from Shanxi</p>
<p>××: The letter you sent was received today, after five months. I wonder what changes have taken place in your life and work during these five months? I have been very busy these days organizing the internal affairs of the school, and there are many things waiting to be done. Even so, I still have to take the time to write this letter to you in the evening.</p>
<p>Since you returned to China, I have written very few letters to you. One reason is that I am at home, and many things cannot be said, for fear that your family will see them. The second reason is that you live in Shanghai, in the occupied area of Shanghai, and the situation there cannot be said, for fear of being censored, causing trouble for you. Now that I know letters can be forwarded in Hong Kong, I will of course write more letters to you in the future. Now I will briefly tell you about the situation here, my work, and my aspirations.</p>
<p>I am now in the Fifth Administrative District of Southeastern Shanxi. The situation in this area was not very good before June last year. Since Rong Wusheng, the political commissar of the Third Column of the Dare-to-Die Corps, took office as the administrative commissioner of the Fifth District, the work here has made rapid progress. In terms of people's movement work, self-defense forces, women's teams, stretcher teams, children's corps, etc. in various counties (a total of twelve counties), districts, and villages have been widely organized. Each time a large meeting is held (such as the Jiang Memorial Meeting and various anniversaries), each county can gather three or four thousand organized masses to attend the meeting. Women with feet as small as earlobes (smaller than three-inch lotuses) have been mobilized from their homes, traveling in groups of three to five in oxcarts to attend the meetings. The leaders of the children's corps are all children over ten years old, shouting clear slogans and waving small fists, leading the singing of national salvation songs. Anyone who sees this situation cannot believe that China will perish. In terms of culture and education, there are more than forty kinds of war newspapers in the entire Fifth District, and the North China edition of the New China Daily has also been published here. Book publishing houses, news agencies, etc. have been established for several months, and quite a few books have been published and reprinted. In terms of schools, the First Branch School of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (formerly reorganized from the Red Army University) has opened here, with more than 7,000 students. This belongs to the Eighth Route Army. The Third Branch School of the Military and Political Cadre School (now renamed the Seventeenth Branch School) belongs to the Third Column of the Dare-to-Die Corps. The National Revolutionary Middle School of the Fifth Administrative District (abbreviated as the Fifth District Middle School) belongs to the Fifth District. The Taihang Mountain Art School belongs to the Third and Fifth Administrative Districts. In addition, each county has a National Revolutionary Senior Elementary School, and each village has a National Revolutionary elementary school. In addition to this, there are also various short-term training classes, literacy classes, etc. The General Labor Union for National Salvation, the General Peasant Union for National Salvation, the General Women's Union for National Salvation, the General Youth Union for National Salvation, the General Cultural and Educational Circles Union for National Salvation, the General Merchants Union for National Salvation, etc. have all been organized in the entire Fifth District and various counties.</p>
<p>In terms of the military, there are the Central Army, the Eighth Route Army, and the Dare-to-Die Corps here. The one with the closest relationship to the government is, of course, the Dare-to-Die Corps. Commissioner Rong concurrently serves as the commissioner and is also the leader of the Shanxi League (the general organ leading the people's movement in Shanxi), so the military, government, and people in the Fifth District have already been united into one.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Shanxi, I originally wanted to work in the Eighth Route Army. The work had already been assigned, and I was just waiting for the car to depart. Unexpectedly, the Third Column was ordered to run the Third Branch School of the Accompanied-by-Troops School. Because no one was running it, I was forcibly pulled into the Dare-to-Die Corps. The Accompanied-by-Troops Third Branch School opened in December of the year before last. By February of last year, because the school was running quite well, it was ordered to be renamed the Fourth Branch School of the National Revolutionary University. By the end of July last year, because all branch schools were canceled, it was renamed the Third Branch School of the Military and Political Cadre School again. I was the director of school affairs at the Accompanied-by-Troops School, managing all school affairs, and the director of academic affairs at the Fourth Branch School of the National Revolutionary University. The principals of both the Cadre School and the Fifth District Middle School are Commander Yan, and the deputy principals are both Commissioner Rong. I am currently the political director of the Cadre School, and because both Principal Yan and Principal Rong cannot actually come to the school to work, I also concurrently serve as the acting deputy principal of both the Cadre School and the Middle School.</p>
<p>The Accompanied-by-Troops School was originally located in Quwo. After being renamed the Fourth Branch School of the National Revolutionary University, it moved to Caogong Village in Yicheng (at the end of February last year) because the [Japanese] were advancing on southern Shanxi. At that time, the other branch schools of the National Revolutionary University all crossed the Yellow River to Shaanxi. Only our school vowed not to cross the Yellow River and resolutely stayed in the rear of the [Japanese] to train political cadres. After staying in Caogong for more than a month, because it was too far from the headquarters of the Third Column and there were too many miscellaneous troops passing through, the school's self-defense capabilities were insufficient, so it moved to Shanjiao Village in Fushan County. We lived there until October of last year. Because there had been no [Japanese] activity in Southeastern Shanxi for a long time, Changzhi was the only large city in Southeastern Shanxi (it could almost be said to be in North China). For the sake of the school's development, we moved to Changzhi again. At the end of January of this year, because the [Japanese] first besieged Qin County, then attacked the Wutai area, then attacked Northwestern Shanxi, then attacked Jixian in Western Shanxi, and then attacked Central Hebei and Southern Hebei, seeing that the situation would lead to an attack on Southeastern Shanxi, we moved into the mountains again. Now both the Cadre School and the Middle School are in these mountains.</p>
<p>When the Cadre School was in Changzhi, it had more than 1,200 students. Now, due to the difficulty of obtaining food in the mountains, the scale has been reduced, and there are still more than 700 students and 170-180 faculty, staff, and cooks. When the Middle School was in Changzhi, it had 800 students. Now there are 600 students in the mountains, and more than 100 faculty and staff.</p>
<p>During the Accompanied-by-Troops School era, we formed a guerrilla detachment. We formed another one during the National Revolutionary University era. Each one had fewer than 100 people when it was formed. Now, after a year of fighting, it has grown into a regiment. The regiment often cooperates with the Central Army in Southeastern Shanxi. The Central [authorities] call us a divine army, calling us lively tigers. When we arrived at the Second Column, the Third Column only had one regiment. In a little over a year, it had developed into six regiments, in addition to two regiments of security guerrillas.</p>
<p>In the six months after the establishment of the Cadre School, the number of students trained has reached more than 1,300. The Middle School also has 300 students. The students who have come out of the two schools are now all over Southeastern Shanxi and the Second Column of the Dare-to-Die Corps. Several of the Cadre School's instructors have served as county magistrates, regimental commanders, and political directors in various counties.</p>
<p>We eat two meals a day. I was very unaccustomed to it when I first came. Eating too much made my stomach bulge, and eating too little made me hungry. It took me a month or two to get used to it. Life was hardest in Cao Village, where we ate millet and peach tree leaves. In Shanjiao, we could eat some white flour. Life was most luxurious in Changzhi, because the school had a lot of contact with the outside, so we often ate banquets. The banquets were not much different from those in the south, and there was also rice. Now that we have gone to the mountains, because both economics and transportation are difficult, we have switched to eating millet. The vegetables are also low-quality, such as turnips, tofu, and bean sprouts. The [Japanese] have not yet come, but it may be even more difficult in the future when the [Japanese] come.</p>
<p>We are determined to persevere in the long-term war of resistance and in the war of resistance in North China. We are determined to stay in the occupied areas and resolutely stay in the rear of the [Japanese]. This task is a great task, but this work is a difficult work. We are determined not to be afraid of hardship. We want to shed the last drop of blood to defend the Chinese nation and defend world peace.</p>
<p>I have abandoned my home. I have forgotten my family. I rarely write to my family. The war has changed everything. Everyone is doing their own thing, and no one can take care of anyone. If I am lucky enough to survive after driving out Japanese imperialism, we can talk about it then. If I am unfortunately sacrificed before the end of the war, then everything is over.</p>

<h3 id="e13">De Wang's Secretary Flees to Chongqing to Discuss the Recent Situation in Inner Mongolia, × Deeply Fears the Desertion of Puppet Troops, De Wang Indignant, Awaiting an Opportunity to Revolt <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Associated Press, 20th] This reporter interviewed Qi Baizhang, a [Mongolian] youth from Inner Mongolia who recently arrived in Chongqing after escaping, to report on the situation in Inner Mongolia. Qi, 28 years old, was sent to Japan by De Wang to study. At the end of last year, he was summoned back to Mongolia to serve as De Wang's secretary. Qi's thinking is correct, and he has insight into the general trend of Eastern return. He is fully aware of Japan's ambition to annex Mongolia. He recounted his escape and the current situation in Inner Mongolia to this reporter as follows:</p>
<p>After being summoned back to Mongolia at the end of last year, he was transferred to serve in the puppet Mongolian Federation Autonomous Government. He only served there for twenty-eight days before taking the opportunity to escape at risk. After experiencing all kinds of hardships, the dangers he encountered when secretly crossing the Sui West Front were beyond words.</p>
<p>At present, × is stepping up its efforts to enslave Mongolia. The Japanese are using the fallacies of the so-called "Greater East Asia" and slogans such as "The Japanese and Mongolian nations were originally brothers thousands of years ago," "China, Japan, Manchuria, and Mongolia are of the same race," and "Asia for Asians" and are using the so-called "warrior spirit" to anesthetize and train Mongolian youth.</p>
<p>The × established a Mongolian Academy in Guihua and also established many schools in Zhangjiakou, Baotou, and He [area name] to change the Inner Mongolian children's consistent thinking about the Republic of China and instill pro-Japanese education. In other words, this policy is another vicious weapon of Japanese aggression in Asia.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese are implementing two major despicable and insidious means in Inner Mongolia: encouraging smoking and prostitution. The toxicity of their intentions is truly immeasurable. They entice the ignorant people in every possible way to fall into their trap and also confuse child soldiers, so that they are inclined to the path of depravity. It can be seen that the Japanese really want to destroy our race.</p>
<p>According to [Qi], De Wang is currently under constant surveillance by ×. It is difficult for him to act on his own. Given his tough and unyielding personality, it is conceivable how painful he must be to be treated as a puppet. At present, De Wang still serves as the chairman of the puppet Inner Mongolia Federation government, with the traitor Li Shouxin as his deputy. De Wang "presides" over government affairs, while military power is "in" Li's hands. At present, there is only one division of the Japanese army in Inner Mongolia. The Mongolian army under De Wang's command has a total of nine divisions. The troops' salaries and weapons are all supplied by the Japanese Kwantung Army and the puppet Manchukuo, which are no different from the Kwantung Army's appendages. However, this Mongolian army has no artillery units in the army at all. The Japanese army is deeply afraid of their rebellion, so it has specially taken the sharp artillery fire as its own to suppress it. It is said that De Wang's Japanese adviser is Tangshan, and Li's adviser is Ichikawa. In fact, all military and political power is in the hands of these two Japanese people. Therefore, under such circumstances, De Wang himself is extremely dissatisfied. He has never forgotten that he is Han, and it is hoped that he will revolt and return to the Central Government soon.</p>
<p>Qi continued, he is a member of the Khoshuud banner of Yichimu League, which is still in our hands. The Japanese have repeatedly tried to use him to subdue the banner. He has repeatedly refused firmly. It was also heard that when he left De Wang at the end of January, he learned that the Japanese army was stepping up construction on the Outer Mongolian border at that time to prevent the advance of the Outer Mongolian army.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 20th] According to Shanghai news, given the seriousness of the European situation, the Japanese have now proposed the cancellation of the Shanghai Public Concession and advocate that the Public Concession be regarded as other Japanese-occupied areas. When the political situation was serious last autumn, the Japanese made this request, but it was temporarily shelved after the Munich Agreement was signed. Now they have raised the same request again. This morning, Japanese newspapers claimed that the existence of the Public Concession was illegal.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Shanghai by the Associated Press, 20th] Since two Chinese rickshaw pullers were assassinated in Hongkou last week, automobile companies in the concessions have refused to send their cars to Hongkou. The "North-China Daily News" stated that the police authorities believe that these assassinations were committed by Japanese and Korean thugs in order to eliminate competition for rental cars and public cars run by Japanese in the Hongkou area.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 20th] The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated today that Foreign Minister Arita, acting on the Prime Minister's instructions, visited Prince Saionji's villa outside Shizuoka yesterday morning to report on important diplomatic events and solicit his opinion. After returning to Tokyo, the Foreign Minister immediately reported to the War Ministry. This consultation with Prince Saionji is extremely rare, and observers believe it is of utmost importance, believing that the Cabinet attaches great importance to Prince Saionji's decisions on certain issues, possibly related to the Soviet-Japanese fisheries dispute and strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] According to Tokyo foreign news, foreign correspondents today asked a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson about rumors that Japan, Germany, and Italy were concluding a military alliance. The spokesperson replied that he could not comment on rumors, but the need to strengthen the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact has indeed been frequently discussed in the Diet. When asked whether the Japanese people supported transforming the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance and whether the Japanese spokesperson could formally deny or confirm the rumored military alliance, the Japanese spokesperson stated that it was neither a matter of denial nor confirmation, and he could not comment on rumors. However, Japan's attitude towards the Anti-Comintern Pact has not changed.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League recently received news from America regarding the American public's attitude towards revising the Neutrality Act. It stated that religious groups, such as the World Council of Churches, and seven other organizations; women's groups, such as the Out-of-School Women's Association, and seven other organizations; labor groups, such as the Workers' Committee, and twelve other organizations; and peace groups, such as the Committee to Promote Peace, a total of thirty-one organizations, have all resolved to appeal for a revision of the Neutrality Act, requiring a distinction between aggressor and victim, and applying the embargo on arms and raw materials to the aggressor nation. Dr. Shotwell, a history professor at Columbia University, criticized the Neutrality Act during a speech at Carnegie Hall in New York, stating, "This act not only fails to distinguish between aggressor and victim, but often aids the aggressor and harms friends." Bishop Channing Aldrich acknowledged at a lecture convened by the Committee to Promote Peace that "the Neutrality Act is the result of the nervous confusion of former leaders of the American government. In a world where everyone is increasingly interconnected, speaking of isolation is tantamount to insincere suspicion."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] According to government sources speaking to the Associated Press, the United States may soon implement commercial sanctions against Japan, similar in nature to those recently decided upon for Germany. This measure will be implemented in the shortest possible time, regardless of whether the European crisis ends or how domestic opinion views the policy of sanctioning Germany. According to commercial experts, commercial sanctions against Japan will be based on revising broader customs tariffs, as Japan's unfair commercial treatment of the United States is more indirect than Germany's. They pointed out that Germany directly restricts trade with the United States, while Japan does not directly restrict trade with the United States. At the same time, American trade in Japan is still considered normal, but in Manchuria and North China, Japan severely restricts American goods. The Commerce Department has already accurately compiled statistics on these affected goods, planning to revise and increase customs tariffs in retaliation. Everything is now awaiting presidential approval.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Members of the International Relations Committee of the United States Congress told the Associated Press that Germany's aggression against Czechoslovakia will cause the United States to change its Far East policy. The US authorities are now considering cooperative steps with democratic countries regarding Far East events in order to resist aggressors. As for the change in America's Far East policy, whether America's policy towards the Philippines will also change accordingly, the committee members declined to comment specifically. However, they declared that the US will negotiate with democratic countries to resolve the Far East problem. Most notably, Britain, France, and the Netherlands hope that the United States will not abandon the Philippines and will maintain its power in the Far East.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Guangxi Student Soldiers at the Front Lines</p>
<p>Recently, the fighting in the Suixian area has been relatively quiet. The Guangxi student soldiers took the opportunity to go to the front lines and perform a new play in ××, ostensibly to comfort the soldiers, but actually to stimulate them and fuel the spirit of resistance. The Guangxi student soldier troupe has three hundred members, with university graduates accounting for 60 percent and secondary school graduates accounting for 40 percent, making them highly qualified. They have undergone rigorous military training, so since coming north to serve in the war zone, not only are their work skills outstanding, but their actions, especially the armed spirit of the female students, often serve as a contrasting stimulus to the local resistance support associations and women's groups that are only nominally active, prompting them to take real action. According to the troupe leader, He Kui, and male students Liang Shanxun, Lu Ruding, and female student Li Suzhen, their experiences are worth recounting:</p>
<p>The Guangxi student soldiers departed from Guilin on December 1st of the previous year. Along the way, they passed through Quanzhou, Hengyang, Changsha, Wuhan, Liu'an, Huoshan, and other places, where they were warmly welcomed by the people. They took the opportunity to do some propaganda work. In Lihuang County, western Anhui, which was then a base for the Fifth Route Army and is now the center for mobilizing guerrilla forces in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region, they used concise leaflets to invite the leaders of the bandits who had been entrenched in the mountains for many years to negotiate. They persuaded them with righteousness, gathered their four or five thousand men, and reorganized them, placing them all under the command of General Liao Lei for combat.</p>
<p>When the inner defensive circle of Wuhan narrowed, a squadron of the student soldiers was assigned to work in Xishui. They saw that the buildings in the city had been bombed beyond recognition, the people had either died or fled, and the city was in a state of "emptiness." They then went to the surrounding villages to carry out their work. In their practical experience, they discovered a bad phenomenon: performing plays attracted everyone to watch, but lectures caused people to disperse. Later, they went door-to-door to make individual propaganda speeches, making everyone thoroughly aware of the meaning of resistance. Or, they started by teaching children to sing songs to serve as a medium for connecting with the adults. As a result, they finally organized them to do their best to help the army fight.</p>
<p>During the planned retreat from Wuhan, they marched at night through ×× Lake and were scattered by × artillery fire. When they regrouped in Jingmen, only one person was missing. Later, they learned that he had taken another route with the covering force. On this occasion, they walked for two nights and most of a day, with only one meal. Recalling it, they still said it was quite interesting—just as they were doing propaganda for the people in Jingmen, they were suddenly attacked by × aircraft, and unfortunately, two female students were killed and one was injured, which was extremely regrettable.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Li Suzhen, the difficulties of doing women's work in large cities are sometimes even greater than in rural areas. Last year, when Wuhan held an anti-aggression conference, they first went to various homes to promote it, asking women to participate enthusiastically. Unexpectedly, many delicate ladies and misses felt that it was a bit beneath them to have them (the student soldiers), with the status of "big soldier brothers" (actually, they should be called "big soldier sisters"), come to talk to them (the ladies and misses). Especially when they were happily playing mahjong, they pretended to grab a handful of tin coins and give them, telling them to go visit other people—however, the female student soldiers were not angry. They still painstakingly awakened them, urging them to magnify the generosity of grabbing a handful of copper coins, so that they could also go to the donation table and show their skills in saving the country. By the date of the conference, all the ladies and misses and poor women who had been canvassed participated enthusiastically. When the meeting ended, it was already dark, and they took torches to escort them home separately. Some were deeply moved and even requested to work with them.</p>
<p>Currently, the student soldiers are working in the Suizao area, and they are also very good at adapting to the environment. If they need to perform plays at night but cannot find kerosene, they use diesel; if they cannot find a ready-made stage, they open the show on the spot. In short, as long as they can achieve the purpose of propaganda and make the people understand the meaning of resistance and the nature of military discipline. Once they understand, they will unite and push the great ship of "national resistance" forward. Some farmers, seeing them packing up their props and going to work in other villages, even came to ask them shyly, "Compatriots—when are you coming back? We will prepare 'da tang' for you to eat—" (In northern Hubei, "da tang," or catching fish in a pond, is a way to treat honored guests), which shows that the inland villagers are, after all, Chinese people with genuine hatred for the enemy, and who cannot easily be mobilized?</p>
<p>Troupe leader He concluded the conversation by saying: From their experience in serving in the war zone for more than a year, they deeply understand that to win the victory of the counteroffensive in the future, the first is political work in the army, and the second is mass movement work in various places. It is also necessary to extensively and deeply promote it as a whole. If there are not so many political workers trained for a while, the groups with current work experience should also be carefully dispersed and sent to various places to lead the work, so as to reap the effect of a few people being able to mobilize many people.</p>
<h3 id="e20">A Review of China's Unity and Recent Developments <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— By Mao Na, Representative of the International Anti-Aggression League</p>
<p>The first year of the Sino-Japanese War has definitely produced the result it should have produced, namely, the realization of a true unity in China that has never existed before. As for how many years there were before of nominal unity and actual division, only Heaven knows. Since the beginning of the war, the only person who has disobeyed the orders of the Central Government is Shanxi Chairman Yan Xifuqu, who has been shot by the military court. Apart from that, no important individual has thrown himself into the arms of the × people or has been disrespectful to Chairman Chiang. Very few Chinese are willing to be puppets of yesterday's × people, participate in the provisional governments established in Beiping and Nanjing, or shamelessly serve them. They are willing to spread poison in China, so that Japan can use this as a resource to aid its invasion of China. This small number of traitors has been reviled by the general public and has a bad reputation, so they cannot get the slightest support. Several members of the Communist Party have been assassinated by patriotic Chinese with swift hands; the others, not only recognize the enemy as their father and receive the support of the Japanese, but also have to be protected by the foreign police of the Shanghai Concession, which is very pitiful. According to the opinions of Europeans and Americans that I have heard in China, the effect of this Sino-Japanese War in promoting China's unity is far greater than the painful experience gained in the previous twenty-five years of civil strife.</p>
<p>The loss of a portion of the rich coastal provinces along the Yangtze River and the departure from the newly built and magnificent capital, Nanjing, and the solemn mausoleum of Mr. Sun Yat-sen have further strengthened China's will to resist Japanese aggression. Needless to say, to resist Japan, it is necessary to unite national strength and support Chairman Chiang. This is the opinion of the public, and everyone is openly saying this, willing to pledge one hundred percent loyalty. Even those who previously did not agree with too much centralization are doing so. Of course, we don't know what some people are really thinking in their hearts, but at least on the surface, they have formed a united front against Japan. This is something that is personally witnessed and deserves to be celebrated.</p>
<p>In addition, what should not be forgotten is that the needs brought about by the war have gradually increased the number of specialized talents who have studied in Europe and the United States, and have also gradually strengthened the forces that oppose the traditional ideas, customs, and habits of embracing the old and stubbornly refusing to change. These people constitute the center of the national independence and liberation movement, and they are increasingly seen as occupying a leading position.</p>
<p>In 1932, Sikorski concluded his book by saying: "Chiang Kai-shek is almost the only one who understands the most important internal conflicts in China. This so-called conflict refers to the conflict between nationalism and communism." At that time, the author thought that the two sides would continue to play out the tragedy and could not reconcile. Obviously, he did not foresee that in 1935, Stalin and Dimitrov would simply let the Third International cooperate with the movements of democratic countries; he did not foresee that in the winter of 1936, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Chiang would make peace and become a gift dedicated to Christmas; and he did not foresee that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang would work together with one heart and one mind, fighting side by side against ×, and that there would be no major friction as a result. In August 1938, the reporter saw Mr. Zhou Enlai, the Communist Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission, in Hankou. He solemnly told me that not only the Communist Party was fighting Japan with all its strength——this is something that even children in primary schools in China know——but also the highest authorities themselves were absolutely cooperating with them in accordance with the agreements of Xi'an to jointly resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>In the cities that the reporter has traveled to in China, everywhere I have seen some people who previously did not agree with the realization of China's unification under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, but now they have come to me and said: He fully supports everyone's recognition of the figure who symbolizes China's resistance to Japan. In other words, it is different now than it was in the past; China has truly achieved internal unification because of Japan's invasion.</p>
<p>In such an atmosphere, whoever has the slightest intention of undermining national unity, whoever has the slightest suspicion of wanting to negotiate peace with the invaders, is the greatest disgrace. Applying this to soldiers, the soldiers cannot stand it. Applying this to officials, the officials cannot stand it; applying this to other political figures, other political personnel cannot stand it either. Let me give an example to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Bosen was the guide who accompanied me in Chengdu. He was the former model governor of Shanxi and is currently the secretary and interpreter for General Yan, the Pacification Director of the Northwest Region. Mr. Zhang once told me that he is a Christian and does not lie, so we can believe what he said about the following. What is it? It is said that a Chinese person went from Shanxi to Beiping and broadcast a message by radio, saying that the authorities had secretly negotiated peace with the Japanese. When General Yan learned of such slander, he was very sad. This rumor was relayed by foreign newspapers. The reporter then sought Mr. Zhang's opinion and asked if he could deny it on his behalf. At that time, I personally drafted a denial, trying to make it as precise as possible, and handed it to Mr. Zhang, saying to him: If the General agrees, I will be very happy to have it published. When I returned to Paris, soon after I arrived, I received a telegram with the content "Agreed," signed by Bosen.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] After a day of intense diplomatic activity, people here are now awaiting the views of France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and the Balkan states. Whether or not they will unwavering follow Britain's lead and emerge to stop Germany's atrocities. Officials are confident that France and the Soviet Union will have no problem. The focus is on Poland, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece. They and Romania all have treaty obligations, but it is not known whether they are willing to fulfill them and join the anti-German front.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] After the Cabinet meeting this morning, people across Britain are awaiting the speeches to be delivered by ministers in the Upper and Lower Houses this afternoon. It is generally expected that these speeches will be about changing British foreign policy to adapt to changes in the European situation. The views of those responsible in Britain can be seen in today's "The Times." The newspaper stated, "Europe has been driven back to the use of force, and nothing else matters. Britain has always opposed the policy of encircling Germany, but Germany's policies and methods are precisely taking this encircling action." "The Daily Telegraph" also stated, "King Carol of Romania has urged Britain to pay attention. We have not yet raised the question of where to draw the line against German aggression."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 20th] It has just been learned that the special cabinet meeting held today will discuss the speeches to be delivered by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in the Upper and Lower Houses. Diplomatic activities in the capitals of various countries are extremely busy, and they are all in close contact with Britain. It is expected that Foreign Secretary Halifax will report to the Cabinet the results of the exchange of views with France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Balkan states. Well-informed sources believe that the issue of jointly guaranteeing the Romanian border is under consideration. Some observers have indicated that this guarantee will be extended to all countries in Southeastern Europe. Although the economic ultimatum from Germany to Romania has been repeatedly denied, the British government has learned that this ultimatum has actually been delivered. Also, yesterday's editorial in the German "People's Observer" stated, "The German government, in view of the attitude taken by Britain towards this Czech incident, believes that the Anglo-German naval agreement has been shaken." This statement has caused some surprise, but there is currently no official information on this matter. [Reuters, London, 19th] It is reported that the cabinet agreed yesterday that, in view of the recent changes in Europe, Britain needs to maintain close ties with all peace-loving countries in the world immediately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] Although today is Sunday, political activities are very busy. The afternoon situation is as follows: (1) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned here from Berlin at 3:30 PM and immediately visited Foreign Secretary Halifax for a 45-minute meeting. It is reported that he made an objective report on the German situation and the intentions of the German government authorities. (2) The cabinet held a small group meeting at the Prime Minister's residence. Those present included Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. The most important topics discussed were reportedly accelerating the expansion of armaments and collectively resisting Germany's expansionist policies. A conference was also considered to be held by the UK, US, France, Soviet Union, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to formulate a common policy to deal with the new aggression. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Halifax also conducted a thorough study with Commerce Secretary Stanley on whether economic sanctions could be imposed on Germany. (3) Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax before the cabinet held a small group meeting, personally delivering a copy of the Soviet note to Germany (stating that the Soviet government refuses to recognize Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia) and informing him that after the Munich Agreement was concluded, although the Soviet Union felt disappointed, it was still prepared to participate in collective action to prevent Germany's expansionist efforts. Regarding this, London political figures said that the British government has now decided to approach the Soviet Union and wants to unite the countries of Northeastern and Southeastern Europe to form a defensive line to resist Germany.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Receives the King and Accelerates the Completion of Military Expansion</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain was extremely busy today. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Air Minister Wood, and Commerce Secretary Stanley visited the Prime Minister this morning. In the afternoon, Dominion Secretary Inskip and Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield also met with the Prime Minister. Chamberlain left Downing Street at 5:50 PM and drove to Buckingham Palace. At 6:00 PM, he met with the King to report on the latest changes in the European situation. When the Prime Minister's car passed through Downing Street, about two to three hundred people cheered him. Chamberlain talked with the King for more than an hour and then returned to Downing Street. British Ambassador to Berlin Henderson arrived in London this afternoon and went straight to the Foreign Office to meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax, lasting 45 minutes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] According to a diplomatic observer, although Germany's economic demands on Romania have been repeatedly denied by both Berlin and Bucharest, the possibility of Germany threatening Romania cannot be considered to have been eliminated. Since the weekend, the British government has been constantly consulting with foreign envoys, and major news outlets have also held discussions several times. What the final decision is will only be known for sure when the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary report to the Upper and Lower Houses today. The Prime Minister had an audience with the King yesterday, talking for an hour, and also met with Chatfield and other defense personnel. It is said that the results of the Cabinet meeting on Saturday determined that the process of military expansion will be accelerated immediately, and it was decided to hold another Cabinet meeting this morning. From this, it can be seen that Britain and France will never let go of further actions by Germany. Also, according to non-official opinions, it is advocated to form a conference of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to decide on a general policy, and then invite the Balkan countries to participate. Yesterday, when Soviet Ambassador Maisky met with Halifax, he also discussed the UK, France,</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] Hitler arrived in Berlin by train at 6:30 this morning to thunderous cheers. All members of the Cabinet went to the station to greet him, led by Goering. In addition, there were various ministers, party leaders, and army representatives. The station was full of Nazi party flags. Outside the station and along the route the leader was sure to pass through, the crowds were unusually packed. In his welcome speech, Goering stated emphatically that Hitler had not only restored Germany's former glory, but had also ensured Germany's security. Today is a day for the leader to be proud of. We do not know how to thank him, but we must adhere to the sacred oath, "For the sake of the German nation, we will never abandon the rights we have acquired." How can such a heroic warrior not have a heroic nation as his backing? You have made the Germans great and courageous. We are willing to make "victory and soundness" the oath of the entire German nation. The sounds of church bells have been ordered to be rung from 6:45 until 7:00. Fifty teams of soldiers were stationed along the route to welcome him, directly to the Linden City, where searchlights created an arched shape. Hitler's car slowly moved forward in the cheers of the crowd, directly to the Chancellery. When it reached Wilhelm Street, the crowd was ecstatic and uncontrollable, breaking through the police cordon three times. The crowd shouted, demanding that the leader appear on the Chancellery grandstand. The leader responded three times and then announced that he could not come out again because there was important business to discuss.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Chicago, 20th] Former Czech President Dr. Edvard Beneš, in a broadcast to the American people today, stated, "The independence of Czechoslovakia is not yet destroyed.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Authoritative sources say that the U.S. Department of State will refuse to assist the German government in taking over the Czech embassy and consulates in the United States.

<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, 20th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, speaking in Birmingham, declared that Britain is not indifferent to events in Southeastern Europe. He has reportedly invited Southern European countries to maintain close contact with the British Foreign Office. As a result, the atmosphere here has improved slightly, less tense than before. Authoritative sources here believe that Romania's recent actions are entirely legitimate, and if a serious situation arises, it has the moral right to receive assistance from Western powers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, 19th] Roads in northwestern Romania are congested with troops heading towards the Hungarian border in Ruthenia. Officials insist that no general mobilization has been implemented, but a large number of young men have been conscripted into the army. It is generally speculated that Romania is deploying approximately 90,000 to 100,000 additional troops to the border. It is said that this step is not only to cope with the international situation but also because the government increasingly believes that the German army's advance into Ruthenia will inevitably approach the Romanian border, necessitating prior preparations. Meanwhile, the atmosphere in Romania has eased somewhat. German-Romanian trade negotiations are expected to yield results on Tuesday, with more limited demands from the German side than previously proposed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Szeged, 19th] The Romanian frontier has been reinforced, and all outposts have been adequately manned. Hungarian regular troops have occupied multiple outposts along the Ruthenian border. Romanian military authorities are properly sending refugees fleeing from Ruthenia into the interior. Refugees of Ukrainian, Galician, and Russian origin are temporarily housed in refugee camps. Yesterday, Ukrainian border guards who crossed the Tisza River into Romania were driven back into Ukrainian territory.</p>

Public opinion unanimously condemns Germany's actions against Czechoslovakia and is determined to resist any attempts to infringe upon the Hungarian border. It is reported that Hungarian border troops have been greatly reinforced.</p>
<h3 id="e26">French Cabinet Holds Meeting; Implements Full Powers Decree; Reinforcements for the Maginot Line; Bonnet Proposes Anglo-French Military Cooperation <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] The French cabinet meeting was held today from 6:50 PM to 8:45 PM. According to a communique, Daladier reported in detail on the first decree of the full powers act. This decree will be submitted to the Council of Ministers at 5:00 PM on Sunday and will be implemented immediately. It is reported that half of the troops scheduled to be discharged in April will remain in service. There are rumors that France is currently conscripting third-level military technicians. Although this has not been officially confirmed, some personnel are currently being ordered to assemble.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] After the Senate passed the bill granting special powers, French Premier Daladier is preparing to issue a large number of decrees promoting the economy and industry. To strengthen border defenses, troops may be increased on the Maginot Line. Although there will be no general mobilization at present, a large number of reservists, including machine gun units, anti-aircraft gun units, and gas defense unit members, will be called up. Foreign Minister Bonnet will soon travel to London to discuss the following matters with Britain: (1) Anglo-French military cooperation, (2) diplomatic measures after the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, (3) how Britain and France should respond to Poland and Franco signing a non-aggression pact, (4) how Britain and France should respond if Germany obtains Memel, Danzig, or the Polish Corridor, (5) how France should fulfill its Franco-Romanian military mutual assistance agreement in the face of Swedish threats to Romania, (6) expediting the conclusion of the Eastern War, (7) the Mediterranean and Red Sea issue, (8) the relationship between democratic countries and the United States, with a particular focus on purchasing aircraft.</p>
<p>Daladier's Speech in the Senate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th] The government's proposed full powers bill was passed by the Senate this afternoon by a vote of 286 to 17 (fifteen Socialist senators and two Communist senators voted against). The government will enjoy broad powers to strengthen national defense until November 30th of this year. At the Senate meeting today, the finance committee reporter, Garde, first presented a review report, advocating that the original bill be approved. He stated that Premier Daladier had assured the committee that no expenses would be increased other than national defense expenditures. Premier Daladier then delivered a speech, recounting the events of the Czech crisis. When he solemnly declared that the French people were deeply shaken by the destruction of Czechoslovakia, all senators stood up in agreement. The Premier then said that as the Munich Agreement had been abandoned and the Franco-German peace declaration had been violated, the serious international situation could quickly lead to tragedy. We may encounter unexpected changes in a short period of time, which is why the government is forced to request special powers from Congress to prepare for any eventuality. The cabinet has scheduled a meeting for tonight to decide on the first batch of measures based on the full powers act and submit them to the State Council for approval tomorrow. The Premier then added that workers in factories nationalized by the government have had their weekly working hours increased from forty to forty-five or even fifty hours. Working hours for workers in private factories should also be increased to increase production volume. He expressed his belief in the republican system, stating that he would not hesitate to extend the terms of members of parliament if necessary in the future to avoid the trouble of re-election, but the institutions of the republic should not be changed. After the Premier finished speaking, Socialist members proposed an amendment to prevent the government from infringing upon public liberties, such as extending the term of parliament members, but after discussion, the Senate rejected this amendment by a vote of 280 to 23 and passed the government's original bill by a vote of 286 to 17.</p>
<p>France to Provide Aid to Romania</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] French Premier Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, and external experts are currently studying and drafting a response to Romania's note, which was sent to Britain and France for assistance after the Romanian government received demands from Germany. Although Germany's demands are not an ultimatum, their content could cause Romania to lose its economic independence. France has been close to Romania in recent years due to its friendly relations with the Little Entente countries, and as a result of its connection with Poland, it may allow Romania to receive aid this time. However, experts at the Foreign Ministry believe that the full opinions of the Soviet Union on this issue should be sought first before discussions take place. Britain has decided to wait until France's attitude is fully determined before taking joint action. Leaving aside diplomatic attitudes, both Britain and France are determined not to allow Romania's abundant oil production, forests, and agricultural products to fall into the hands of Germany, because if these resources are taken away by Germany, its power will be able to advance westward. Moreover, France currently relies heavily on Romanian oil, and the economic agreements in place cannot be abandoned.</p>
<p>French Newspapers Advocate Firm Steps</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The French ambassador to Germany arrived here this morning to meet with Foreign Minister Bonnet. French newspapers advocate taking firm and drastic steps to deal with the international crisis. Newspapers of different political views unanimously pledge to support Premier Daladier. There is satisfaction here with the Soviet Union's refusal to recognize Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Prague, 20th] The sorrow of the Czech people over the occupation of their homeland has not diminished in the slightest. Every face expresses sadness and depression. Crowds continue to gather at the Monument to the Unknown Soldier.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 19th] Today, Czech people are escaping into the countryside for walks, unwilling to see German troops patrolling Wenceslas Square (in Bohemia). Others are staying away or refusing to raise the Czech flag. Key members of the Czech government were forced to sit alongside German military authorities to watch the parade. Led by General Gablenz, the parade lasted two hours and included infantry, artillery, and tank units, as well as several squadrons of aircraft flying low in the sky. Only the flags of the National Socialist Party were visible in the city center.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 19th] Reports of arrests and suicides are increasing daily. It is reported that several thousand people have been detained, mostly German refugees who fled from the Sudetenland and Austria. Most are politicians and journalists. It is reported that no Jews have been arrested. This mass arrest is carried out by Czech police under the orders of the German secret police. The director of the Polish news agency here has also been detained and has not yet been released (according to the Polish ambassador to Germany, a request has been made to the German side). According to the Czech news agency, a bomb was discovered in the home of a German leader in a district of Teplice-Šanov, about 35 miles north of the capital of Slovakia. Fortunately, no one was injured. Another person threw a bomb at a German in the street, but it missed.</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Czech National Humiliation <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Czechoslovakia is lost, but the Czech people are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation, and most Czech social leaders are unwilling to be submissive citizens of a conquered nation. Therefore, the Czech national salvation movement has evolved into a national restoration movement, unfolding in a lurking struggle. It is not only underground but also at crossroads and in public gatherings, holding anti-fascist and anti-aggression demonstrations. The sound of the national anthem resonates, and anti-German riots are everywhere. Former Czech President Beneš has also delivered a broadcast speech in the United States, preparing to call on the Czech people to fight for national restoration.</p>
<p>However, the oppression of fascist aggressors will naturally be doubled in severity and cruelty. A report from Prague on the 19th states that the number of arrests and suicides is increasing daily, with dozens of people reportedly arrested. These arrests are carried out by the German secret police. This simple report alone is enough to imagine how difficult and dangerous the Czech people's national restoration movement is today.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the Czech people's national restoration movement has a future because as long as groups of people unwilling to be slaves unite and fight bravely and resolutely, they will surely achieve final victory. However, our Chinese compatriots should be more vigilant about the Czech people's national humiliation. The Czech Republic was lost because it abandoned resistance, sought peace in humiliation, and compromised midway. As a result, after the aggressors' half-year preparation, it could not avoid final destruction. Therefore, today we should firmly oppose the talk and actions of "stopping resistance" and "seeking peace midway." Our resistance has already achieved results. Do not wait to compromise and lose the country before trying to restore it!</p>

<p>An Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 20th states that Qi Baizhang, a young Mongolian noble who recently escaped from Inner Mongolia to Chongqing, said that he was a trusted secretary of Prince De. Now, most of the people in Inner Mongolia have realized that the Japanese aggressors are using them to attack their motherland, because they are suffering the insufferable treatment of slaves of a conquered nation under the rule of Japanese military police. The vast majority of the Inner Mongolian people oppose Japan, and Prince De, who is being used by Japan, also has a heart that does not forget Han and is preparing to resist. We cannot lightly dismiss this news.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, we must know that in order to complete its plan to conquer all of China, Japan is now stepping up its insidious steps, implementing a deceptive appeasement policy on the one hand and a vicious poisoning policy on the other. As for its pretext of independence and freedom to divide the unity of our country's various ethnic groups, its poisonous schemes are countless, and it uses them to the extreme.</p>
<p>In order to strive for the complete and thorough liberation of the Chinese nation, today we must intensify the steps to smash Japan's poisonous schemes. The main thing is to implement Sun Yat-sen's ethnic policy of "equality for all ethnic groups within the country" and democratic politics during the war of resistance, starting with the Mongolian ethnic group, strengthening the unity of various ethnic groups in the country, mobilizing the latent forces of all ethnic groups, and adhering to the war of resistance and national construction to strive for common freedom and happiness.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Democracy? Dictatorship? The President of the United States <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Dong Ping</p>
<p>"Let me remind you, I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy—" So it was, not long ago, that President Roosevelt said.</p>
<p>Recently, there have also been rumors that President Roosevelt said, "The borders of the United States are now in France." This sentence, although derived from what Prime Minister Baldwin said when he was Prime Minister: "The borders of Britain are now in the Rhineland." But, its meaning today is far deeper than it was then.</p>
<p>Just by looking at the tone expressed by President Roosevelt, we know that the United States is preparing to cope with an overseas war, or an emergency domestic dispute. President Roosevelt, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, has concentrated military and political power in himself. Naturally, in the future war or dispute, he will be able to bear full responsibility and faithfully perform all his tasks.</p>
<p>Therefore, such a President of the United States cannot find an equal in the governments of European countries. In some places, he is like a king; in some places, he is like a dictator; but, in some places, his power does not even reach the British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>That is truly a great work, but also a truly painstaking work. For many years, although it can often be seen that four or five presidential wives are all alive and well in the world, many of those retired presidents themselves rarely enjoy longevity and sit and watch the rule of their successors.</p>
<p>In peacetime, the power of the American President is often limited. President Roosevelt, because he said a word, was questioned by the Senate Military Committee, and then said: "Let me remind you, I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy"—Indeed, in ordinary times, the power of the American President can also be said to be about the same as the French President.</p>
<p>But, in times of crisis, he will concentrate all power in himself and handle it freely. At that time, democracy is lost, and he is a dictator.</p>
<p>Everyone should still remember President Wilson during the Great War—his words were law: his dignity was superhuman; his power was unlimited. When the war ended, he crossed the Atlantic to lead the peace talks, he was truly like an American ruler with supreme talent.</p>
<p>But, what was the result? Democracy took revenge, bringing down the supreme figure it had created with one hand. The great Wilson finally stepped down in an atmosphere of ridicule and contempt.</p>
<p>The American people give their President a lot of power, almost equal to what Hitler and Mussolini themselves seized from the people. But, there is a huge difference inside. No matter how "dictatorial" the American President becomes, in the end, he must step down in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.</p>
<p>The President's annual salary is 15,000 pounds. His work is divided into three parts: diplomacy, legislation, and judiciary.</p>
<p>First, the President is responsible for appointing ambassadors and ministers to foreign countries, and like the King of England, he is also responsible for receiving foreign envoys. This is the simplest task in his diplomatic work. He obtains information on various foreign meetings and discussions from the State Department—the American Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He can actively take the initiative on the diplomatic stage.</p>
<p>He can advocate what kind of foreign policy his country should adopt, and his advocacy has a lot of power—like a king in a democratic country. But, he cannot ultimately decide foreign policy alone; because, if he wants to negotiate with that country or sign a treaty, he must obtain the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The Senate is composed of two representatives from each state. Therefore, this is why the Senate Foreign Relations Committee often circulates in the newspapers, and the President's every diplomatic move must be honestly reported to it.</p>
<p>In principle, the President does not have the power to declare war. That power belongs to Congress; Congress includes both the Senate and the House of Representatives; the House of Representatives has 435 representatives. But, the President can naturally guide the situation to a point where war is inevitable when negotiating diplomacy. The American war with Mexico in 1845 is an example. President Wilson also led the United States to participate in the last war amidst opposition from all sides.</p>
<p>Now we can talk about legislation. In England, bills are submitted to Parliament for discussion and passage by the King's ministers. In theory, it is also considered to be following the King's instructions. The American President cannot do this. Neither he himself, nor through his ministers, can propose a bill. The Constitution only allows him to report on national affairs in Congress, or at most, to recommend a bill due to the needs of the situation.</p>
<p>So, how can he do whatever he wants? Very simply, he can find a member of parliament to propose the bill on his behalf. Naturally, the purpose of the President's proposal is to express it clearly.</p>
<p>If the President disagrees with Congress, he can use the veto power. It goes like this: For example, if President Roosevelt does not approve of a bill passed by Congress, he can return the bill to Congress within ten days after its passage and request the Senate to reconsider it. Unless both houses can pass it again by a two-thirds majority; otherwise, it cannot become law.</p>
<p>This veto power is equally dangerous in democratic countries. Many presidents have fallen because of using this power. Only two, Jefferson and Cleveland, worked hard to use it successfully.</p>
<p>Only in a recession, like President Roosevelt's current situation, is the President's domestic power not very great. Many judicial and administrative powers in the United States are related to state or city governments. Today, unemployment, trade difficulties, and other issues are good opportunities for President Roosevelt to exercise domestic power.</p>
<p>American cabinet members are appointed by the President, but many other officials are appointed by senators; however, their work is still under the command of the President and paid by the government. Therefore, many tasks are still often done by the President himself. This is the contradiction of the American administrative system. (Translated from the Hong Kong "Shi Mian Xi Bao")</p>

<h3 id="e34">Hong Kong University Requests Increased Appropriation from the Boxer Indemnity Fund to Promote Sino-British Cultural Cooperation. Professor Hsu Ti-shan Expresses Three Expectations to the Special Committee: More Chinese Teaching Materials Should Be Adopted for Schools Run for China <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Hang Liwu did not arrive in Hong Kong yesterday; the special committee meeting is postponed.</p>
<p>The University of Hong Kong, the only institution of higher learning in Hong Kong, recently established a special committee to study cooperation between the University of Hong Kong and universities in mainland China. After the announcement, Chongqing expressed a warm welcome. At the same time, Minister of Education Chen also made a public statement, as reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>HKU Requests Increased Boxer Indemnity Fund Allocation</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the special committee recently established by the University of Hong Kong holds great expectations for the future of the university and cooperation with the central government. Sir Mark Young, the Governor of Hong Kong, deeply believes in the necessity of Sino-British cultural cooperation and that the University of Hong Kong bears a significant responsibility in promoting such cooperation. Therefore, he pays close attention to the composition of the committee. However, due to limited funding in the past, the University of Hong Kong has not been able to fully develop, especially in engineering, which requires further expansion. Therefore, it is planned to allocate a portion of the Boxer Indemnity Fund to subsidize the university. Among the Chinese members of the committee, Hang Liwu is the Director-General of the Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee, which shows the high expectations for the committee.</p>
<p>Three Expectations: Professor Hsu Ti-shan of the Chinese Department of the University of Hong Kong was interviewed yesterday afternoon regarding the issue of promoting Sino-British educational and cultural cooperation. Professor Hsu expressed three expectations for the committee: First, since most of the students at the University of Hong Kong are Chinese and the authorities are Chinese, and the purpose of running the school is to cultivate talent for China, Chinese teaching materials should be adopted as much as possible, and more Chinese teachers should be hired to impart Chinese culture. Second, students at the University of Hong Kong, regardless of their major, whether medicine or liberal arts, should have a sufficient foundation in Chinese national studies. Third, he hopes that the government will pay more attention to the curriculum of the University of Hong Kong and send personnel to inspect the school annually within the possible scope, or ask the university to send school affairs reports regularly. In 1931, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee allocated £265,000 to the university, but did not inquire about the use of this fund. In the future...</p>
<p>The University of Hong Kong Has Close Ties with Us</p>
<p>Professor Hsu believes that since our country subsidizes the University of Hong Kong with such a large amount of money, the relationship between the University of Hong Kong and our country is no different from the relationship between foreign churches and the universities they establish in our country. Our country's educational conferences should actively invite the University of Hong Kong to participate, giving it the opportunity to report on school affairs and discuss various close cooperations. Now that the University of Hong Kong's special committee has been established, with the goal of promoting Sino-British educational and cultural cooperation, our country should seize this opportunity to discuss the curriculum with the University of Hong Kong to promote our country's cultural level.</p>
<p>Special Committee Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>Furthermore, the first official meeting of the University of Hong Kong's special committee was originally scheduled for yesterday. The agenda was also drafted by the committee's secretary, Finnegan. Our member, Hang Liwu, was supposed to fly from Chongqing to Hong Kong yesterday, but Mr. Hang was ill in Chongqing and could not travel as scheduled. He telegraphed to Hong Kong to inform the committee. The first meeting of the committee has now been postponed. It is also reported that the University of Hong Kong Management Committee held a routine meeting last night to discuss the progress of school affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Hong Kong's Rubber Shoe Industry is Flourishing, with Sales Spreading Worldwide; Exports Were Worth Over Ten Million Dollars Last Year; There are Over Five Thousand Workers in Hong Kong Now <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong's rubber manufacturing industry has gradually flourished in recent years. Among its products, rubber shoes are the most common and are exported in large quantities from Hong Kong every year. This trend has become even more pronounced since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Yesterday, a reporter visited a Hong Kong rubber manufacturer and asked about the recent situation of the industry.</p>
<p>Exports Worth Ten Million Last Year</p>
<p>According to him, Hong Kong's rubber manufacturing industry has been developing rapidly in recent years, with rubber shoes being the most important product. In previous years, sales were mainly in Hong Kong, the mainland, and Southeast Asia. In recent years, however, sales have spread all over the world, with sales to London being the largest, accounting for almost 50% of Hong Kong's exports. The next largest markets are various parts of Southeast Asia and the West Indies. Exports from Hong Kong last year were worth approximately HK$11 million, more than double the amount five years ago. Unfortunately, due to the impact of the war in mainland China and traffic congestion, Hong Kong goods cannot be imported. Otherwise, the value of exports would be even higher.</p>
<p>Compatriots Love It, Foreigners Enjoy Using It</p>
<p>Many years ago, Japanese rubber shoes were sold in large quantities in Hong Kong and British territories, and because of their low prices, it was extremely difficult for Hong Kong goods to compete. However, after the British government implemented a policy of rewarding colonial products by exempting rubber shoe imports from tariffs, Hong Kong's rubber shoe industry saw a major turnaround. Furthermore, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, merchants, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, changed their trade policies. At the same time, the psychology of the Chinese people changed, and they preferred to use domestic products. As a result, the sales of Japanese rubber shoes in British and Southeast Asian territories plummeted. At the same time, domestic rubber shoes took the opportunity to rise, which is why they are so prosperous today. Currently, the products are not only loved by Chinese people but also enjoyed by foreigners, as can be seen from the sales in London and the West Indies.</p>
<p>There are Currently About Five Thousand Workers</p>
<p>Most of the raw materials for Hong Kong's rubber shoes come from the United Kingdom, such as rubber from British Southeast Asia and canvas from London. Although some are ordered from Hong Kong weaving factories, this is only a small number, and their products are only sold in Hong Kong. There are only three to five large rubber factories in Hong Kong, and three to five small ones. There are about 5,000 workers, mostly women. The main product is rubber shoes. In recent years, some have also been manufacturing gas masks, raincoats, and rubber boats, which are supplied to our country's military.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Broadcasting Station is the largest and most influential emerging broadcasting enterprise in our country. It has long enjoyed a high degree of faith among the Chinese people. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the station has shouldered the great task of "propaganda warfare" and confronted the Japanese invaders. Although it has been constantly damaged by the Japanese invaders, its spirit of continuous effort and rapid development in broadcasting is like the military's growing strength in the Anti-Japanese War. It has now become the only institution for wartime news reporting. It is reported that the Central Broadcasting Administration is actively building a 35-kilowatt shortwave broadcasting station in Chongqing, which has been completed and officially began broadcasting in February of this year. All parts of the country can receive the broadcast, and it is equipped with directional antennas to radiate to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. At this critical moment of the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction, external propaganda is extremely important. The station's range reaches Europe and the Americas, and it should be fully utilized in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Guangzhou Foreign Vessels Released Indefinitely; Shipping Companies Suffer Great Losses; Shengchang and Jiya Cargo Ships Released and Returned to Macau Yesterday; Other Vessels Such as Dali Are Still Detained and Not Yet Released <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, more than ten ships operating on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong and Guangzhou-Macau routes were detained by the Japanese in Guangzhou and the West River. Except for the Foshan and Jiangsu ships in Guangzhou and the West River, which returned to Hong Kong a few days ago, there has been no news of the other ships for several months. Although the British have negotiated with the Japanese, there has been no result. During the Luohu incident a few days ago, when Japanese representatives came to Hong Kong to negotiate with the central authorities, it was rumored that the release of foreign vessels detained in Guangzhou would be discussed, but it is now known that this is not true. A reporter investigated the shipping companies yesterday.</p>
<p>Except for the Shengchang, which was released the day before yesterday, there is still no news of the release of the other detained ships. It is not yet known when the matter can be resolved. The ships have been detained for several months, causing great losses to the companies. Recently, many of the staff of the detained ships have been summoned back to Hong Kong by the Hong Kong companies. In order to make up for the losses, the companies are mostly negotiating with the staff to reduce their salaries during the suspension of operations to maintain operations. It is learned that the Shengchang was released at 8:45 AM on the 19th and departed from Guangzhou for Macau. It arrived in Macau at 7:00 PM that afternoon. According to a crew member, after the fall of Guangzhou, the ship was detained in Guangzhou along with the Jinshan and other ships. It was initially anchored on the White Swan Pool, but later the Jinshan and several other ships were released, while many others remained in the province. The Shengchang then moved to the Shamian embankment to await release. It was not until the 17th that it received a notice from the Japanese, and on the morning of the 19th, it was released to return to Macau, but was not allowed to take passengers or load cargo. On the morning of the 19th, before departure, the Japanese sent personnel to search the ship, causing various disturbances. A batch of fir planks that had been loaded on the ship a few days ago was also moved back ashore. After all the crew members were checked one by one, the Japanese sent a Japanese warship to guide them out of the port. At the same time, the Jiya, a cargo ship flying the Portuguese flag, a cargo barge, and the Wuchang, a Taikoo Line cargo ship flying the British flag, and a cargo barge were also released, all towed by the Shengchang. After reaching Humen, they started their own engines and sailed away. When the ship was docked in Shamian, all crew members had to obtain "good citizen certificates" and wear them on their chests before they could go ashore. Most of the goods sold in the market were Japanese goods, and purchases were limited to military tickets. Therefore, the military tickets issued by the Japanese military department now amount to several million yuan. It is also said that the Japanese are now seeking to restore the prosperity of Guangzhou. There is now a ferry service to Foshan and Pingzhou, both flying the Japanese flag. The ship may operate once every two weeks between Guangzhou and Macau, like the Jinshan's Hong Kong route, in an effort to restore transportation between Guangzhou and Macau.</p>
<h3 id="e40">With the Hong Kong Government's Active Development, Agricultural Production in the New Territories Has Increased Significantly; Production Accounts for One-Fifth of Hong Kong's Total Consumption <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In order to solve its own food problem, the Hong Kong government is actively developing agriculture in the New Territories. This work, with the encouragement of the Hong Kong government and the efforts of the Agricultural Association, has achieved considerable results. In recent years, various types of agriculture in the New Territories have made rapid progress. The Agricultural Association is responsible for leading farmers to promote production.</p>
<p>Agricultural Association Encourages Farmers to Plant</p>
<p>At a recent meeting, the association discussed this in detail. All directors believed that in this extraordinary period, the association should urgently encourage and guide all New Territories members and general farmers to plant vegetables and grains on a large scale to supplement the needs of Hong Kong residents, as this directly affects Hong Kong's food and vegetables. The association has now entrusted this plan to the members of the Technical Committee, who are in close contact with farmers in various villages in the New Territories. Improving farming techniques and increasing production are constantly being studied and refined, and the results have been exceptionally good. At the same time, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many compatriots who fled to Hong Kong from the mainland also moved to the New Territories to buy land and cultivate it. Therefore, the number of farmers in the New Territories has increased significantly in the past year, and the production of various grains has also increased considerably. According to official statistics from Hong Kong last month, Hong Kong residents need approximately 270 tons of vegetables per day, and the New Territories and various islands can only supply 30 tons, accounting for approximately one-eighth of total consumption.</p>
<p>Production in the New Territories Has Increased Significantly Compared to Before</p>
<p>According to agricultural merchants' estimates, production in the New Territories has now increased compared to before. Although it has not been able to completely solve Hong Kong's food problem, it is sufficient to supply one-fifth of the total. In the current situation, it has provided considerable assistance to Hong Kong's food supply. For example, last month, when the supply of vegetables from the mainland was short due to the impact of the war, it was also thanks to the production of the New Territories that it was possible to supplement the supply and prevent a serious panic over vegetables and grains. The Hong Kong government authorities are still constantly working hard to develop agriculture in the New Territories. The government, in view of the large amount of cultivated land in the New Territories, if rice fields are converted into vegetable fields, even if the goal of self-sufficiency cannot be achieved immediately, it will be able to provide a considerable supply. Recently, the Hong Kong government has ordered the Department of Agriculture and Forestry to send experts to study and investigate its development possibilities. In the future, it will definitely formulate a concrete plan based on the investigation report to promote its development through incentives and supervision, so that the land in the New Territories can be fully utilized, and Hong Kong's food supply can also benefit greatly.</p>

<p>National Regret</p>
<p>Since Hitler's forceful invasion of Czechoslovakia, it has caused unrest in the general situation in Europe. Whether the current Czechs will be the successors of the Jews is even more noteworthy. It is learned that there are a considerable number of Czech expatriates in Hong Kong, and it is said that several have received instructions from their country's consulate general in Hong Kong to change their passports to German passports. However, according to the German Consul in Hong Kong, Paletz, yesterday, he has not received instructions from Europe regarding the current status of Czech expatriates and is unable to comment.</p>
<h3 id="e42">National Education Conference Decides to Increase Funding for Overseas Chinese Education; Three School Principals Attending the Conference Returned to School Yesterday; Subsidy Methods to Be Handled by the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Third National Education Conference was held in Chongqing and closed yesterday, the 9th. Personnel attending from various places left Chongqing one after another. Wu Dingxin, Chen Bingquan, and Li Yinglin, the principals of the National University, Guangzhou University, and Lingnan University, respectively, who went to attend from Hong Kong, also returned to Hong Kong yesterday, the 19th, at 8:30 PM, taking China Aviation and Eurasia aircraft separately. Yesterday, reporters visited Wu and others and learned that the conference emphasized adapting to wartime.</p>
<p>Adapting to Wartime Education, i.e., vigorously implementing military education to meet the needs of the great era. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave an important speech on this point, but it is not convenient to publish it. In addition, there are some proposals that are not convenient to publish, such as how to implement or restore education in guerrilla areas, and the implementation of peacetime and wartime military training. The general impression is that the spirit of the conference was good and unanimous. In order to facilitate the proceedings of the conference, in addition to the plenary session, group sessions were held, namely, primary, secondary, higher, social, normal, overseas Chinese, and border groups. Wu Dingxin, principal of National University, told reporters that he focused on the two issues of overseas Chinese and border education, saying that he was one of the examination committee members of the Overseas Chinese Education Group. The Ministry of Education submitted several proposals on overseas Chinese education to the conference for discussion. Previously, the government allocated 140,000 yuan annually from the Boxer Indemnity and the national treasury to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to assist overseas Chinese schools for the purchase of books and instruments. Based on this established method of the Ministry of Education, he proposed to increase this subsidy as much as possible, which was approved by the conference. It was also resolved that the Ministry of Education should jointly handle all matters with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in the future.</p>

<p>[Jiangmen Express News] The Jiujiang River × Qing soldiers have been inactive and lurking in one corner. Since the 17th, the Jiujiang River × army has increased again, with about five to six hundred people, and is attempting to attack Heshan and Xinhui. Ou Jian, the magistrate of Heshan County, regarding the frequent movement of the Jiujiang River × bandits, has requested General Deng Longguang, who is in charge of protecting the West River, to dispatch troops to defend. The recent × situation in the Jiujiang River is as follows:</p>
<p>×Also Bombarding Gulao Estuary</p>
<p>The Jiujiang River × army suddenly increased to more than 300 people on the 17th, and set up artillery positions in the area of ​​Zhewei and Honglou Xuexian Palace on the opposite bank of Gulao. On the morning of the 17th, dozens of cannons were fired continuously, bombing Gulao. Our self-defense team responded calmly, and our new artillery defending the area returned fire and fiercely attacked the × artillery position. After a fierce battle lasting about ten minutes, the × artillery fire on the river × side ceased, and we stopped. On the morning of the 18th, Guan Shan × artillery positions fired again, remotely shelling our Gaoming estuary area, reaching more than ten rounds, but most of the shells fell into the river, and we suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Jiujiang River South ×Gunboats Gathering</p>
<p>According to a phone call from Heshan, more than ten × gunboats were suddenly discovered in the south of the Jiujiang River on the evening of the 16th, cruising back and forth, and seemingly planning to cross the river and attack Gulao in Heshan. Our army and the guards were on alert. On the morning of the 17th, four × gunboats attempted to attack Gulao. Our self-defense force waited until the × gunboats approached and then bombarded them. Two × gunboats were injured and fled in embarrassment to Sanshui, Hekou, Makou, and other places.</p>
<p>Ba Jia and Liang Long ×Gunboats Gathering</p>
<p>According to our intelligence, the × has been intensifying the construction of fortifications in Ba Jia, Longshan, Longjiang and other places along the Jiujiang River in recent days, and forcibly capturing our strong men to serve as coolies. The ×'s conspiracy is to strengthen the Jiujiang defense forces on one hand, fearing attacks by our guerrillas. In addition, it has been found that rumors have been rampant in the Siyi region recently, claiming that the × will invade the Siyi region again. However, according to the investigation, the restlessness of the Li Jiang River × is just a bluff, and it is unable to invade in the short term. Currently, all parts of the Siyi region are as peaceful as usual, and the people's hearts are extremely stable.</p>

<p>[West River Correspondent] On the 12th of this month, × aircraft suddenly flew and bombed Luoding County. The situation has been reported in previous newspapers. According to continued reports, when the × aircraft bombed Luoding, because there were no air defense facilities inside and outside the county seat, the × aircraft were able to fly low and drop bombs, reaching as many as 117. The area of the southeastern gate of the county seat was devastated and turned into ruins. Collapsed walls and broken tiles piled up on the roads. Prosperous places in the morning, such as Zhenlong Market, were also turned into scorched earth. More than 100 people were killed and more than 300 injured. Since the beginning of the war, Luoding has been the most tragic among the cities attacked by × aircraft. At present, the county government is actively handling the aftermath, employing hundreds of people to clear away rubble day and night, and building sheds in the southeast urban area and other places for refugees to live in.</p>

<p>[Zhaoqing Express News] Gaoyao is the forefront of our West Road Resistance War. The organization and training of the people has been carried out with great success. Since the Party Department's Special Commissioner Huang Xijue was reassigned as Secretary, various actions have become more active. The following is a record of the county's mobilization of the people.</p>
<p>Implementing Wartime Women's Education</p>
<p>Secretary Huang Chang is implementing wartime women's education and has mobilized to organize a Women's Wartime Education Executive Committee. Measures have been drafted and are being actively implemented in conjunction with the government. The content includes hiring female teachers from schools or social organizations and female leaders to serve as committee members, responsible for the planning and implementation of women's wartime education, and planning to establish training classes to teach (1) rescue, (2) fire fighting, (3) transportation (radio receiving) talk drivers to transmit information, etc., (4) education and production skills, (5) propaganda, (6) intelligence, etc.</p>
<p>Holding Anti-乂 Eliminate Traitors Public Exhortation</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese and eliminating traitors is the current urgent task. All sectors of Zhaoqing have established an Anti-War Work Committee to encourage the people to actively participate in wartime work. In order to make it known to every household, in addition to using various methods such as writing, singing, drama, books, and lectures to expand propaganda, anti-× and eliminate traitors public exhortation will be carried out. The area will be divided, and students from various schools and political departments of the stationed troops will go to each household to publicize and talk individually, so that people understand the necessity of anti-× and eliminating traitors and assist the government in eliminating traitors and resisting the war to the end.</p>
<p>Preventing ×Incitement Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war in South China, many river ferries retreated into the West River. In order to facilitate transportation, the authorities ordered the West River Shipping Administration to implement control. However, some ferries were destroyed by × aircraft or stopped sailing voluntarily, resulting in a large number of unemployed sailors. In addition, after all highways were destroyed, traffic was interrupted, and many employees were unemployed. Everyone was living a hard life on the West River, and it was difficult to guarantee that the violent × would not take the opportunity to incite them and induce them to return to Guangzhou to be used by the ×. The County Government Party Department, in order to strictly prevent this, specially organized and established a Water and Land Transport Service Corps to assist the government in military transport and try to provide relief to them. Those with specialized skills will first be introduced to various agencies to serve.</p>
<h3 id="e51">×Central China Is Trying to Suppress ×Anti-War Sentiment Is Growing ×War-Weary Military Morale Is Shaking, We Seize the Opportunity to Counterattack ×Sanshui ×Attempts to Establish a Puppet Organization and Fabricate Public Opinion <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Central China Secretly Discusses Suppressing Anti-War</p>
<p>[West River Express News] It has been found that the × army's West River Commander Zhongyuan Shaojiang, who recently arrived in Sanshui, believes that internal anti-war sentiment is growing and our army's counterattack is becoming more acute. On the 15th and 16th, he specially convened a military meeting of all officers in the Hekou Customs Headquarters to discuss how to defend and how to suppress the anti-war thoughts and actions of the × soldiers. It was decided to strengthen the defensive strength of the West River front line in order to advance and invade or retreat and defend. In recent days, × chief Zhongyuan personally inspected defenses in the southwest, Hekou, as well as Hanggang, Yangmei, Ganghen, and even Jiujiang, and convened lower-level cadres to give speeches in order to suppress anti-war actions. The situation is panic-stricken, which shows the tension of the anti-war atmosphere within the × army.</p>
<p>Our Army Teams Seize the Opportunity to Counterattack</p>
<p>Our guerrilla teams lurking in the central and southern districts of Sanshui believe that the internal morale of the × army is wavering, and it is appropriate to seize the opportunity to launch a counterattack and deal a blow to the ×. They are now uniting with the Southwest, Hekou, Ganggen and other places to advance. At the same time, they are requesting Deng Guang, a military general of the West River Electric Army, to immediately dispatch a strong force to assist in the attack to annihilate the stubborn ×. On the evening of the 18th, a certain unit of our guerrilla team launched a night attack on the × camp in Ganghen. A fierce battle broke out for a time. For about 30 minutes, our team secretly and gracefully withdrew to preserve its strength. Two hours later, it continued to send a small unit to attack the × camp. The × army was unaware of the plan and responded in a panic. However, our army advanced and retreated suddenly, appearing and disappearing mysteriously. As a result, the × army was restless and panicked. At the same time, another team, taking advantage of the darkness of the moonlit night, destroyed the two highways newly built by the × army from Sanshui City to Hanggang and from Ganggen to Dalu Market. The section from Ganggen via Zhennan and Zhaobian was particularly severely damaged. Currently, the two highways have not been completed and the × is at a loss.</p>
<p>Organizing Puppets and Implementing Puppet Regime</p>
<p>In addition, it has been found that after the × chief Zhongyuan appeared in Sanshui, in addition to sending out large troops of infantry and cavalry to actively force each township to investigate household registration, compile Baojia, elect district and township chiefs, and establish a puppet maintenance committee, he also instigated Han Hao to persuade Chen to serve as the chief of the Sanshui puppet maintenance committee, attempting to use political power to rule the entire Sanshui County. It has been found that the Sanshui puppet organized by the × this time is different from other counties. It is preparing to wait for the puppet maintenance committees of each township to be established before producing an administrative commissioner and a chief of the puppet maintenance committee. Its meaning is to fabricate "public opinion" as its base. Its cunning conspiracy is outrageous.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Correspondent] The reporter received a message yesterday from an air defense observation post on the Northern Route, saying that × aircraft have frequently flown to various places on the Northern Route to invade for several months. Last month, there were 29 attacks, with more than 400 bombs dropped. Eight schools were destroyed.

<p>Guangzhou was occupied by the ×, and the Pearl River channel was suddenly closed. At that time, the ships that remained in the province were trapped by the ×. Although the companies concerned had negotiated several times, it was still ineffective. This matter was silent and delayed. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, a small British cargo ship Pinli, which had previously been trapped in the provincial river by the ×, arrived safely in Hong Kong and is now moored on the Mong Kok sea. The reporter also met with the ship's staff yesterday. According to reports, the reason why the ship was able to return to Hong Kong safely this time was sudden. Hours before we left the province, there was still no news of release. After obtaining the special permission of the ×, we hurriedly started and hung up. Today, it is fortunate to escape the tiger's mouth and return unharmed. The reporter then inquired about whether there was news of the release of the Dong'an, Dali, Quanyu, Daming, Guangxi and other ships still remaining in the province, and the various situations after the fall of Guangzhou. It is said that the ships remaining in the province have not yet received the release signal from the ×. As for Guangzhou after the fall, it is now like a dead city, with nine out of ten houses empty, petty thieves everywhere, and local thugs, the × are using them as accomplices. Therefore, in the months after the fall, we (referring to the crew) could only stay in the cabin. Although we were able to go ashore to inspect occasionally, we felt that the most prosperous areas in the past have now become rubble fields, which is shocking and makes people feel sad and angry. But what makes people even more indignant is the brutality of the × people. After occupying the city, they immediately announced martial law, and passers-by were often humiliated innocently. Therefore, those who currently live in the city are mostly the poor, helpless, old and weak, and a group of thugs and hooligans. In short, Guangzhou is now like a dead city, with extreme shortages of food, fuel, and all daily necessities.</p>
<p>In addition, the Wuchang ship, which was the first to travel from Hong Kong to the province after the fall of Guangzhou, also departed from the province and arrived in Hong Kong on the previous (19th) day.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Hugh Herbert's Experiment: Test If You Are Popular <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Humor is truly an ethereal thing], said Hugh Herbert, "Take myself, for example. When my father gave me ten dollars and told me to make a living in the world, I chose to sell 'vacuum cleaners' as my profession. After six weeks, the manager said, 'Hey, what's going on? You haven't made a single sale in all this time.'</p>
<p>'No, but I've certainly collected a lot of garbage.'</p>
<p>That wisecrack cost me my job. I packed my bags. Later, one rainy day, I joined a guerrilla acting troupe. The manager looked at me and immediately decided I was a comedic character. Then he went to Hollywood, originally to work as a director. But by chance, he changed his mind and returned to being a comedian."</p>
<p>According to him, "humor" in life is like salt on the dining table, an indispensable thing. Recently, he put some effort into creating a rather interesting test, comprising thirty-four questions, divided into four parts. The first part is specifically about personal character, with ten questions. The second part concerns social life, with nine questions. The third part examines whether your targets of laughter are appropriate, with eight questions. The fourth part has seven questions and tests your storytelling skills. The questions can be answered with "yes" or "no". They may seem easy, but this old fox might have put in some traps for you.</p>
<p>Each correct answer is worth ten points; each wrong answer is zero points. There are no deductions for wrong answers. Therefore, the highest possible score is 330 points. (One question is specifically for women, and another is specifically for men.) Naturally, not everyone can get a perfect score. If your score is above 225, great! That's excellent, and you'll be popular wherever you go. 150 to 225 is average. Anything lower is below average. If your score is only below 50, I'm sorry to say, but you seem little different from a robot.</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>1. Do you like to play practical jokes on people—like putting a feather duster on someone's bed, etc.?</p>
<p>2. If one of the following situations occurred, would you still be in the mood for some fun?</p>
<p>1. Your car breaks down and you're helpless, and you're still six miles from home.</p>
<p>2. Your toast is burnt to a crisp, and your eggs are as hard as iron.</p>
<p>3. Your roof is leaking, and you're getting soaked.</p>
<p>3. If someone offends you, will you be unhappy all day because of it?</p>
<p>4. (Specifically for women) If you're infatuated with someone praising your beauty, do you smile and use a witty remark to change the subject?</p>
<p>5. (Specifically for men) If she says dreamily, "What a lovely night," do you give her a clever reply—such as "Yes, perfect for mosquitoes"?</p>
<p>6. At home, do you get angry before breakfast?</p>
<p>7. Do your family members find you to be an interesting person and laugh at the jokes you tell?</p>
<p>8. Are three or more of the following five things that you like?</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse,</p>
<p>Irvin Cobb,</p>
<p>Eating corn on the cob with your hands,</p>
<p>The Marx Brothers,</p>
<p>Watching the movements of the orchestra conductor.</p>
<p>9. Can you point out the humorous aspects of a situation?</p>
<p>10. If people make fun of "you," can you take it?</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>1. When dining in public, if you accidentally drop an oyster out of your plate or a fork onto your lap, can you cover it up with a witty remark without looking embarrassed?</p>
<p>2. Can you quickly find the punchline in a joke or story someone is telling?</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Inauguration of the Fumin Theater, Operated by Japanese Interests in Shanghai: An All-Encompassing Anesthetic for Our Country <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese are using cinematic arts to anesthetize the people of our country. This is a predetermined plan within their policy of military aggression. We only need to look at what happened after the fall of the Northeast: cinemas were placed under Japanese control, and the films shown were almost entirely supplied by Japanese film companies, invariably showing politically-charged films that promoted "Japanese-Manchurian-Chinese Friendship," "Japanese-Manchurian-Chinese Economic Cooperation," and "Joint Anti-Communism," insidiously anesthetizing the Chinese people. After the August 13th Incident, in all occupied areas, cinema was either controlled or subjected to strict censorship. The intention was self-evident.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the Japanese are adopting their consistent policy of preparing to open a cinema in the Hongkou area. This news has been circulating for a while, but recently it has materialized. Its name is the Fumin Grand Theater, and it is scheduled to officially open on the 13th. It is located on the original site of the Guangdong Grand Theater, with only slight internal renovations. On the opening day, Japanese singers will perform various songs and dances, and Japanese waitresses from Hongkou will sing on stage. It is said that about a thousand people, including Japanese and Chinese residents, will attend the opening ceremony and be seated for free, which of course is aimed at attracting a large number of ruffians.</p>
<p>The Fumin Grand Theater is affiliated with the Fumin Film Company, which was established by the Japanese. Therefore, in the future, the films shown in this theater will largely consist of films controlled by the Fumin Film Company in China. In addition to films, various performances such as Japanese dramas will be staged from time to time. According to Japanese film promoters, many Chinese stage performers, singers, and dancers have signed contracts with the Fumin Grand Theater and will soon appear on stage. However, whether this is true remains to be seen. Even if it is true, it will merely attract some degenerate members of the entertainment industry.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Singapore Chinese Football Team Victorious on Philippine Tour, Defeats St. Thomas University Team 3-1 <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Eastern vs. Scots League Match Rescheduled to Thursday</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The Singapore Chinese Football Team, a group of eighteen people led by Shen Guandou, departed from Singapore on the 12th of this month and headed for Manila to compete in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Yesterday's English evening newspaper contained a Manila telegram stating that after the Singapore Chinese team arrived there, they first played against the strong St. Thomas University team on the 18th (Saturday). The competition was fierce, and the Singapore Chinese team won 3-1.</p>
<p>The Singapore Chinese team's victory on this Philippine tour, and especially their defeat of the notoriously strong St. Thomas team, shows the strength of the Singapore Chinese team.</p>
<p>The Eastern Athletic Association football team has been actively preparing for its expedition to Hanoi and Haiphong. Star reporter Chen Fuyu has been elected as the team leader. To enhance their strength, they have invited St. Joseph's player Li Anna Sousa and Shanghai players Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to join the team. It is said that Xu and Cao will arrive in Hong Kong before the 25th of this month and may be able to join the team for this Saturday and Sunday's league match against Middlesbrough. The team still has hopes for the championship. If Xu and Cao can join the team in time, they will surely have the confidence to defeat the American team.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the second-round match between the team and Scots, originally scheduled by the Association for 5 pm on the 22nd (tomorrow) at the Hong Kong Football Club ground, has been rescheduled to the 23rd (Thursday) with the consent of the Association and Scots, according to team captain Li Deqi. Therefore, tomorrow's First Division League match will only feature South China South vs. St. Joseph. The match schedule for this week is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e61">Chiu Lai Basketball Team Defeats Heroic Sing Tao with Deliberate Slow-Paced Strategy: Chiu Lai Performs Well, Winning 38-33; Second Division Ling Ying and Police Win Victories <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Three Open Men's Basketball matches were held last night, including First and Second Division games. In the first match, Second Division Reporter vs. Ling Dream, the Reporter team was weakened because players Mao Ziming, Ma Zhaohua, Cheng Baoqi, and others were suspended and unable to participate. They were behind 8-32 at halftime. They worked hard to counterattack in the second half, with Xiao Dianlian making repeated outstanding contributions, but because they were too far behind in the first half, they ultimately lost 29-43. In the second match, First Division Sing Tao vs. Chiu Lai, the former was the reincarnation of the Youth Association team, which has won the championship for several years in a row and has not been defeated for many years. The latter is also a strong team in the First Division, with famous players Chen Ruzheng, Zhang Rensheng, Su Bohui, Guo Nan Hong, Li Yuanfen, Shen Ruiqing, etc., and their strength is also very strong. Although the team lost their first match 45-49 to South China the day before, they rallied last night and defeated Sing Tao. The team's victory was not accidental. In terms of merit, main player Chen Ruzheng deserves the most credit. His shots from the side were accurate, which can be called an amazing technique. Shen Ruiqing's interceptions and passes have mastered the essence of the game, but his shooting is still not calm enough and has not yet reached perfection. Zhang Renfa, although old, has not lost all his skills. As for Guo Zhihong's offense and Li Yuanfen and Su Bohui's defense, each had their own strengths. For Sing Tao, Dai Fucheng's strong attacks and Liang Guoduo and Pan Yaojun's resistance to the enemy were all excellent performances, but famous player Zhong Zhiqiang performed poorly, failing to win when he should have and missing many good opportunities. In short, the biggest reason for Chiu Lai's victory was the adoption of a deliberate slow-paced strategy, which was well-executed, and the defeat of Sing Tao's high-speed five-player offensive and defensive method, which created this victory.</p>
<p>After the two sides faced off, Sing Tao immediately took the offensive, and Dai Fucheng's shots and free throws were all successful, giving them a 7-0 lead. Chiu Lai counterattacked, and Chen Ruzheng and Guo Zhihong broke through, tying the score at 8-8. Soon after, Zhong Zhiqiang joined the battle, and Chiu Lai's offense became stronger. Guo Zhihong and Chen Ruzheng were unstoppable, taking the lead with scores of 14-10 and 20-10. At the end of the first half, Chiu Lai led 24-15. After the start of the second half, Sing Tao's Pan Yaojun joined the game, and their momentum was boosted. He and Dai Fucheng cooperated, and the score was 21-28 and 30-23. When Chiu Lai's Guo Zhi Ming was fouled out four times, the situation became extremely tense. Afterwards, Chen Ruzheng and Shen Ruiqing became active again. Although Sing Tao won several free throws, it was to no avail and could not reverse the situation. At the end of the match, Chiu Lai defeated them 38-33.</p>
<p>In the last Second Division match, Police played against Youth Force, and the Police team won with superior skills, winning 42-35. The scores for each team are listed below:</p>

<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>[Special Report] In last month's issue, everyone gained a general understanding of the "effectiveness of morning exercises." I believe that after reading this article, everyone will have questions about the scope of the effectiveness of morning exercises, whether they can help with development, increase lifespan, etc. Please be patient and let me provide a detailed introduction so that everyone can gain a thorough understanding and a central belief, and then put it into practice. This is my sincere hope. Now, I will discuss the main points in detail below.</p>
<p>(1) Develop the Habit of Getting Up Early</p>
<p>An ancient proverb says, "The plan for a lifetime lies in diligence when young, and the plan for a day lies in the morning." Getting up early is certainly a good habit. If we can consistently do morning exercises, we can naturally develop the habit of getting up early. Because morning exercises must have a time limit—they must be done in the early morning. If they don't have a time limit and are done arbitrarily, they shouldn't be called morning exercises; they should simply be called regular exercises. Therefore, people who consistently do morning exercises have all cultivated the good habit of getting up early.</p>
<p>(2) Have the Effectiveness of Restoring Fatigue</p>
<p>Gentle exercise can restore fatigue, which is acknowledged by every physical education expert. However, the effectiveness in morning exercises is even more noticeable. After a whole day of work or excessive exercise, our body and mind are very tired. Even after eight hours of rest at night, the fatigue in the body and mind cannot be completely restored. Or, if we sleep for too long, we still feel more tired. If we can use the morning time to exercise, we will feel refreshed and happy after the exercise. This is my personal experience, and it has been tested by many people and is the most reliable effect. The reason is very simple. It is probably because after exercise, the body temperature increases, and breathing and blood circulation accelerate, which causes the fatigue elements in various parts of the body to be discharged.</p>

<p>The Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Tournament, decided upon some time ago by the association conference, has yet to materialize.

As for the participating teams, the association will select the six strongest women's teams from Hong Kong and China, and the competition will be a single-elimination format.</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Tasks That Instructors Should Undertake During Basketball Training <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] An excellent basketball team cannot be trained overnight. It requires countless sweat and tears, enduring hardships and expending time and effort, before satisfactory results can be achieved. A large part of this success comes from the instruction of a wise coach. The instructor's immediate tasks include allocating appropriate training time and selecting standard, legitimate materials for implementation.</p>
<p>During training, instructors should pay attention to understanding each player's moral character and their technical strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, they should use a recording method to track each player's progress and level in each practice session. This is the most important task for instructors during training. The sample recording table is copied below.</p>
<p>By carefully examining this chart, we can distinguish the differences between each player, which may not be apparent in regular practice. Therefore, instructors can use this chart to examine the detailed statistics of their players' progress and skills, and then implement special guidance based on a standard assessment to help them achieve rapid success and cultivate outstanding talent. This is of great value.</p>
<p>According to the results on the table, Zhang Zonghou shoots more accurately from the left side of the court than from the right, especially in front of the basket. Conversely, Li Youwen shoots more accurately from the right side of the basket than from the left. Chen Mingsheng has weaknesses in all aspects of long-range shooting, but shoots reasonably well when close to the basket on the right side.</p>
<p>Based on these results, it would be a mistake to assign Zhang Zonghou to the right wing and Li Youwen to the left wing. Similarly, it would be a mistake to have Chen Mingsheng play as a running guard and attempt long-range shots. Chen is best suited as a follow-up man, and he is most reliable when receiving rebounds and shooting within the free-throw line.</p>
<p>From these aspects, we understand the importance of this record table. The strengths and weaknesses of the players themselves can be clearly seen on this table. Furthermore, with the guidance and criticism of a wise instructor, considerable success can be achieved. Therefore, during the training period, the instructor's only task is to use this table to clearly record each player's skills. Each time a review is obtained, progress is felt with each session.</p>

<p>Due to the impact of the precarious European situation, the Hong Kong stock market has suffered a major blow. Unless the European situation takes a sudden turn for the better, the volatility in the local market cannot be stabilized. Yesterday, the price of HSBC shares was below par, but trading volume was considerable. Apart from that, there were very few transactions in other stocks, only sporadic trades. As for the prices of various stocks, they were generally lower than last week, but investors did not seem eager to sell off their holdings, so the market can be described as stable.

<p>— Translated by Lü Jueliang</p>
<p>——Several Postcards from Esperantists Around the World</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>The full-scale War of Resistance has removed the pressure that the Esperanto movement in China has always suffered. Most Esperantists immediately stood on the international propaganda front, participating in the work of the full-scale War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, all Chinese Esperanto publications concentrated in Shanghai were suspended due to the retreat from Shanghai. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, "New Stage" (jointly published by Esperantists in Hong Kong and Guangzhou), "Far Eastern Messenger" (run by Esperantists from Shanghai and Nanjing in Hong Kong), and "Oriental Voice" (Hankou) emerged one after another. They contributed greatly to the liberation struggle of the motherland in terms of calling for support and reporting news. Later, "Justice" (the successor of "New Stage") stopped publication after the abandonment of Guangzhou. "Oriental Voice" moved to Hong Kong before Wuhan fell and is still working hard with "Far Eastern Messenger" towards the same grand goal.</p>
<p>Every Chinese Esperantist knows that propaganda work is not limited to passively reporting on the war situation and exposing enemy atrocities in publications. It also involves actively working with Esperantists from other countries – establishing close contact. Therefore, all Esperanto publications maintain extensive communication, and also receive many letters from Esperantists and groups from various countries expressing great admiration and comfort to our supreme leader and brave soldiers.</p>
<p>What follows are a few short postcards from the hundreds of consolation letters sent by Esperantists from various countries to the editor of "Far Eastern Messenger" for forwarding to Chinese soldiers. These short notes are filled with the infinite sympathy and encouragement from progressives around the world for our War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Dear Editor of the Esperanto magazine "Far Eastern Messenger":</p>
<p>We, the small people of Norway, send you our deepest respects. Our entire nation truly admires your Chinese nation's self-defense war against the hateful Japanese militarists. We also express our utmost respect for Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, as they are the best of people.</p>
<p>Please send me a copy of your magazine! I plan to translate some texts from your publication to help the poor Chinese with propaganda. The dearest greetings from Norwegian comrades –</p>
<p>We must defeat the despicable Japanese – G.L. Johnson (Norway)</p>
<p>To the soldiers defending the soil of China. Dear Comrades:</p>
<p>We view your resistance war against the Japanese fascists for the liberation of the nation with admiration and sympathy. We clearly know that by doing so, you are not only serving your motherland, but also benefiting other countries that are either openly or secretly threatened by brutal fascists.</p>
<p>Therefore, we owe you a debt, which should be presented to you with sincere sympathy. Because you will bring a richer future to your nation and all mankind.</p>
<p>With comrade greetings!</p>
<p>G.P. Bruun</p>
<p>(Dutch representative in the Bancy People's Front)</p>
<p>Chinese Soldiers:</p>
<p>In the September issue of 'Far Eastern Messenger', I read the articles about encouraging Chinese soldiers.</p>
<p>Like true Zamenhof believers, peace warriors, I hope you, be your righteous guardians. God will bless you, to fulfill your wishes in all respects. You serve the whole of mankind and the true democratic countries in the world, bravely defend your independence and justice, and drive away the beasts who are dedicated to destroying culture!</p>
<p>Long live peace and justice!</p>
<p>Zamenhof's peace warrior, A. Obierlman (Poland)</p>
<p>To the Chinese soldiers fighting bravely:</p>
<p>In my school and home, most of my friends admire your brave struggle against the Japanese bandits, especially me. In my country, Argentina, everyone feels that it is necessary to cooperate with your brave Chinese soldiers to be anti-fascist boxers who maintain peace and freedom, and for us, this is necessary. Who is the real winner? We are all convinced that it belongs to your side. To the brave Chinese soldiers in the front! We salute you!</p>
<p>Your Argentinian friend, Sun Yuegen</p>
<p>(Argentina)</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>Yes, she was finally dragged back from school by her father. Placed under surveillance at home. Therefore, hadn't he also had negative feelings towards his father? She said:</p>
<p>"What father? A traitor!" She was young, she was weak—determined by her physique, her gender, her habits of life—a weak person who found it difficult to express her resistance through action—beyond the blind impulse of emotion; in the end, it was nothing more than complaints, even curses. However, she still tried to donate as much as possible within her means. Her friends knew and praised her:</p>
<p>"You are truly a good daughter of China!" When the maid came with green tea, she felt a little calmer; her heart, as if it had been suspended, was falling back to its original place. However, he was afraid of the talkative maid; even if she didn't cause any accidents, she would inevitably waste unlimited time because of her talkativeness; so he forced her to refuse the maid's tea, so that the maid had no chance to come in and talk. She didn't make a sound; and the maid outside the door refused to leave, as if she were saying: "Let me in, I have so many things to say, I must say them." Therefore, he was a little angry, and he said in a low voice: "Speak quickly, no tea!"</p>
<p>A clever person, in a sudden change, is often not clever, and sometimes even foolish. Only when he saw her pointing to her throat with trembling fingers did he remember that the handkerchief was stuffed in her mouth. He thought:</p>
<p>"Why are you so afraid of me! I won't kill you." But this was not a correct understanding, and she did not understand herself either, what she was expressing. It was not so much driven by grasping some revolutionary viewpoint—but half driven by the concept of loving one's motherland—because people are not allowed to let their motherland perish, this has already become an instinct, and half driven by her own weak personality—because the emotions of the weak are fragile, sadness and joy are equally easy to be moved, plus she still retains her natural goodness, making her feel closer to the suffering of others—unconsciously sympathizing. However, she cast a doubtful gaze on this newly acquainted envoy of the volunteers, and wrote:</p>
<p>"Are you a volunteer?"</p>
<h3 id="e77">Records of Jiangyin City Defense and Others <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——Folk Novel Anecdotes</p>
<p>According to "Anecdotes on Novels," "Records of Jiangyin City Defense is a type of "Jing Tuo's Lost History," but adapted into a popular novel." Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Popular Novels" includes it but notes "Unseen." Note that the word "Lost" should be an error for "Escaped/Lost." "Anecdotes on Novels" also says: "The four kings and eight generals in the book all have surnames, but after checking other detailed records, it seems almost as if they are non-existent. Moreover, among those who died in battle during the early Qing Dynasty, there were only Nikan and Kong Youde, and their events took place in Yunnan and Guangdong, not in Jiangyin. Presumably, the so-called kings were military nicknames. The riots in Suzhou had what were called the Eight Great Kings, which are similar to this."</p>
<p>The author of "Anecdotes on Novels" had seen "Feng Yi Bian," because the fifteenth chapter of that book was "Incited Rebellion in Suzhou over Shaving Hair, Pretending to Offer Incense to Assassinate the Eight Great Kings," so they cited the "Eight Great Kings" as an example. However, they were unaware that the "City Defense Records" (written by Han Yan of the Qing Dynasty in local dialect), on which the popular novel was based, had the following records: "Lost Three Kings and Eighteen Generals," "(August) 11th, the Qing soldiers attacked the North Gate, and Seven Kings died." ""12th, the Qing soldiers still attacked the North Gate, and Two Commanders-in-chief died."" "14th, Jiangyin feigned surrender, and King Xue died." "29th, the Qing attacked the South City, and the Tenth King died." According to "Records of Loyalists on the River," there were also the so-called Eight Kings who died on August 12th after being hit by gunfire. The deaths of the other kings are the same as recorded in the "Jiangyin City Defense Records." It seems that the author of "Anecdotes on Novels" was a little negligent here.</p>
<p>The "Double Loyalty Records" (with Zhang Shun and Zhang Gui resisting the Yuan as the protagonists), "Snow Cellar Ice Heaven Records" (an adaptation of Aji's River Crossing Records), and "Battle of Caishi Records" (with Yu Yunwen's military achievements as the focus), mentioned separately in "Anecdotes on Novels," are like "Jiangyin City Defense Records," all novels that I have longed for and eagerly wanted to read, but unfortunately, they all seem to have been lost.</p>
<p>Because we are talking about the fall of Jiangyin City, it reminds me of "Another Biography of the Righteous People of Jiangyin." A friend of mine said after reading the biography:</p>
<p>"As long as the people are willing to resist, the country will never be conquered by foreign races—if everyone is willing to resist, political corruption will not occur, any heresy will not be heard, of course there will be no traitors, and it will especially arouse international sympathy and gain assistance. The strength of the people is great, far surpassing any other force. If you don't believe it, we can look at the resistance of the people of Jiangyin at the end of the Ming Dynasty against the Manchus, with their small area, a motley crowd, resisting hundreds of thousands of Manchu soldiers for as long as eighty-three days, and inflicting heavy damage on them. If you don't believe it, we can also look at the achievements of the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi and Hebei today, and see what kind of blows they have given to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>"I hope that those who read this book will have such an imagination: the Qing soldiers and Tatars are what today? Liu Liangzuo is a traitor in the puppet government, and the Seven Kings and Two Commanders-in-chief are Jiangyin of what, any county or city in the country, perhaps the students in our modern schools, Gao Rui and Xu Yuyang are our old men, and the Cheng Sheng and He brothers are ordinary merchants in our cities. All the wars written here are modern wars. The cruelty of the invaders, our struggles, are all present realities. I hope that our compatriots, everyone, will have the determination to act as Xu Yong to Chen Erlang and Huang Yuqi. And our wise officials will all have the wisdom, courage, and loyalty of Chen Er, and the eventual failure of Jiangyin in the past is not surprising, because at that time there was no second Jiangyin, and now we are Jiangyin everywhere, we will never fail, therefore, we don't have to be discouraged by the failure of Jiangyin in the past, but instead use its failure to inspire our shared hatred, so that we will surely succeed and avenge our national hatred."</p>
<p>Because his words are very insightful, I copied them here for readers to refer to.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Old Master, the Idiot, and Lei Yuan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>This is a sketch of characters, fragments of a story, a true account of neighbors from my childhood. I've lived in unfamiliar places for several years, and three more years from now, it will have been twenty years. My childhood memories are a bit faded and vague, which is a regret. I never finished watching a legend at the appropriate moment.</p>
<p>In the story, we should first mention three characters who appear: the first is "Old Master," the second is "the Idiot," and the third is "Lei Yuan." They are related, all surnamed "Hang." If calculated by age, the Old Master is in his fifties or older, while the Idiot and Lei Yuan are both in their twenties or thirties. Some say the Idiot is much older than Lei Yuan. It's said that in terms of seniority, the Idiot should be the most senior. The property they live off is all under his name. The local people are generally unclear about the Hang family's background. They were originally from another place and moved here to live for a long time. In any case, the Hangs themselves understand the situation; no one cares about idle matters or the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>The Old Master once held a minor official position; he was a proper person who wore an official hat. The Idiot is just an idiot, from childhood to now, and into the future. Lei Yuan is a prodigal son, a spendthrift, a rascal. Three different types of characters mixed together, thus unfolding a legendary story.</p>
<p>Lei Yuan eats, drinks, and doesn't work, acting carelessly. Fortunately, the family can still support an idle person. He has some pocket money to spend on the streets, which doesn't interfere with the family's affairs. His life consists of gambling, making trouble, and engaging in lewd activities. His talent: he once ate seven bowls of plain noodles in a row without his stomach complaining. He started a fire himself and tried to frame the neighbors. He has a lot of crude strength, making people afraid of his rascality. But he doesn't dare to challenge the Idiot. That would be risky because he is not a match. Not a word, not a dose of medicine, and even in terms of strength, he is no match for the Idiot. The Idiot has a kind of idiotic stubbornness, somewhat numb to blood and death.</p>
<p>"A poisonous mosquito bites a poisonous snake, using poison to fight poison." The general saying is not wrong at all.</p>
<p>The Idiot eats and stays put, like a clay Bodhisattva standing at the mountain gate, watching people, the sky, and the door, like a guard dog. He is quite serious with strangers. He has no life, no story, sometimes with a touch of comical innocence, always blank, neither smiling nor crying. He is already an adult, but every night he still wets the bed, like a child, big or small. This happens quite often, so no one pays attention to him. A small room is prepared for him to lie down in, with a urine-soaked pillow, urine-soaked bedding, urine-soaked bricks, and urine-soaked bed frame, like a piglet. Occasionally, a kind-hearted old woman puts the urine-soaked bedding in the sun, and the small courtyard is filled with the smell of urine. If someone offends him, even if it is his own family, he won't recognize them. It's as if he's a wild horse; no one dares to confront him. Only the Old Master can be asked to show his face and scold him loudly. He will be like a child being punished by his mother, not daring to make a sound, quietly slipping away.</p>
<p>"The official, with the fire of samadhi on his head, can rectify what is crooked." The general saying is not wrong at all.</p>
<p>The Old Master, many people would introduce him to you as an experienced and worldly person. Perhaps he once had a golden age of rich experience, and now he is retiring at home. He lives upstairs in a small building, reads dull books, dabbles in herbs, and lives a life of leisure as an elderly man. He is quite carefree. His samadhi frightens the Idiot, but he is no match for Lei Yuan. When Lei Yuan exerts his strength, he dares not touch a hair on his head. A rascal doesn't care about anything; he doesn't care about old or young, just acts recklessly and ruthlessly. The elderly are always cautious, and even if they are seniors, it's best not to suffer immediate losses.</p>
<p>"This is the feng shui of the Hang family's ancestral grave." The general saying is not wrong at all.</p>
<p>These three prominent figures, with their indelible and different personalities, mixed together, restraining each other, creating a cycle, often putting on good shows for the neighbors to watch. After getting used to it, it becomes a bit bland, but the children are still very happy. I was one of them, a little afraid, a little curious, secretly watching. "Although the Hang family produced a prodigal son, it is still a good family, all thanks to the Idiot's good fortune. If the Idiot dies, if the Idiot dies..." The general saying is not wrong at all.</p>
<p>When I left this place, the Old Master did not die, the Idiot did not die, and Lei Yuan did not die. They were all quiet, without any storms, in their old ways, a picture of unchanging cycles.</p>
<p>Therefore, my story has no tail.</p>
