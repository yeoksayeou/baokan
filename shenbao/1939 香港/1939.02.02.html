<h3 id="c1">粉碎×軍的華南攻略 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>華南×軍旣以錐形突繫自大亞灣襲佔廣州，數月以來，一方爲防我軍大舉圍攻，加緊廣州近郊防禦工事之建築，企圖堅守機點；一方卽陳兵三水，作溯西江犯廣西之張本。幸我軍亟急調整，從容阻遏：人民揭竿而起，隨時隨地予×打擊：業已爭得主動，穩定戰局。惟以最近×人續向西江增兵，×艦不時出沒北海附近二事判斷，則圖桂之心，依然未戢。廣西爲西南腹地屛障，復爲收復廣州之前進陣地，安危得失，久爲國人目光集中所在。因就可能公佈之材料，作一簡略之說明如下。</p>
<p>廣西全省，山嶺盤結，水流急湍，加以政治已上軌道，民風撲實强悍，×欲染指，明知必經絕大犧牲；但爲企圖切斷我中法國際交通綫，威脅西南諸省計，實有不惜孤注一擲之必要。故華南×海陸軍雖踟蹰未能越三水一步，同時復散放圖桂烟慕，部署新的進攻，原因實亦在此。據一般推測，×人遲遲未能遂行圖桂軍事，問題固在廣東我軍民之×愾同仇，準備反攻，犯桂路綫，要亦爲華南×首腦部所最難抉擇，蓋×欲自粵省進攻廣西，僅有四綫可通，而每一路綫，×均非胃絕大危險，不能獲寸土尺地：</p>
<p>（一）自三水溯西江攻蒼梧。此綫因西江自蒼梧以下，全年可通航淺水兵艦，×海陸軍可聯合進攻，且距桂最近，實爲進犯廣西之捷徑。但目下我軍除以重兵鎭守西江下游各要地，阻擊敵陸軍進犯外，已將西江水道，自肇慶以上，嚴密封鎖，不准通行。（即以蒼梧下游之鷄籠州封鎖綫而論，縱深卽達十里。）</p>
<p>（二）利用海軍，取道東京灣，在北海登陸，經廉（合浦）欽西趨邕甯（南甯）龍津（龍州），切斷中越交通綫，阻我國際運輸，然後循湘桂鐵路之延長綫，北出柳州，拊桂林之背。此綫最爲一般人所注意。但據熟悉該方情形者稱：北海沙多水淺，敵巨型艦絕難近岸，軍隊登陸，尤屬困難，卽令×僥倖登陸，在廉欽以西，復有「十萬大山」之阻，敵機械化部隊决難飛越。該方我築有國防工事，並派有精銳之×××師及×××師等嚴密監視，敵央難逞。</p>
<p>（三）利用海軍，在廣州灣附近（或北海）登陸，循公路綫北犯鬱林，經容縣以襲蒼梧之後，該方我除派有重兵駐守外，已將鬱林以南各公路，澈底破壞。（過去由桂赴港滬者，多取道廣州灣，自公路破壞後，現須改由邕甯，龍津出鎭南關，經河內赴港滬）且因有勾漏山脈之天險，卽令登陸，亦難深入。</p>
<p>（四）利用陸軍，自三水向西北，沿綏江經四會，廣甯入桂境之懷集，然後折趨開建以側擊蒼梧，此綫爲南宋岳飛剿曹成路綫，適處粵桂湘三省邊區，如出西北，且足威脅桂林衡陽。但因公路均已澈底破壞，且有蒯渚嶺之盤錯，現代化裝備之×軍，决難企求發展。</p>
<p>據若干戰略家之估計：一般人咸以×將以主力出北海，而在西江助攻。惟×人戰略，恐適反是。蓋西江究屬捷徑，與北海登陸之難易相較，相差甚遠。目下廣東戰區及準戰區之公路，正積極破壞，惜多不甚澈底。桂省接近準戰區各地之公路，則已澈底破壞。多處因阻塞山水，已蓄成沼澤；或因鋤成農田，卽公路之形跡亦已煙滅。故×如欲利用公路入桂，殆已成夢想。</p>
<p>地理條件旣足阻滯×人進入廣西，而廣西人民建築精神壁壘，尤爲堅强。廣西兵役成績，夙稱優良。截止去歲下半年，雖曾一度發生逃避兵役現象，但經省府當局及早補救，早已恢復常態。且爲準備長期之全面戰爭計，全省壯丁，正受游擊戰訓練。並利用原有之民間槍枝，培養自衞力量。據最近統計，全省各區縣鄉村直轄之壯丁游擊隊員（自十八歲至四十五歲）已在一百萬人以上，有槍約三四十萬枝。除就地練習游擊戰外，並及嚮導，偵探，糾察，鋤奸，運輸（人力，獸力，物力。）救護，招待，洗衣，縫紉，担架，掩埋等項勤務。故×人萬一僥倖跨入廣西省境，則除在正面將遭遇我正規軍之打擊外，此百餘萬久經訓練之游擊隊員，必將處處予以掣肘，致寢食不安，進退兩難，終至覆滅而後已。</p>
<p>此外，廣西未開化之少數民族，如苗如猺，種類甚多，當局鑒於宋明諸代苗亂教訓，對此早甚重視。因自民國二十三年起，創辦特種師資訓練所，招收苗猺等族靑年，入所訓練，以爲開發少數民族之主力部隊：並經常派遣政工人員，在苗猺等族山區工作，成績相當可觀。全面抗戰以後，此項少數民族，雖尙未參加作戰，但各族壯丁，多已受當局派往該區之軍事教官訓練。目下已有隨時可就地集合打擊敵人之苗猺等族壯丁×萬餘人。此項消息，當爲關心西南少數民族問題者所樂聞。</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3 id="c2">論最高國防委員會 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 高歌</p>
<p>適應抗戰建國新需要，成立最高國防委員會，是這次國民黨五中全會最重大的成就，也是中華民族在革命政黨號召影響與直接領導下英勇抗戰一年半以來最重大的成就，對於中華民族解放運動前途，對於東方民族革命運動前途，將有非常重大的良好影響，使人感到無限的興奮與無限的期待。</p>
<p>綜合中外各關係方面的消息，五中全會决議組織成立的最高國防委員會，具有特別重大的性質與意義。第一，最高國防委員會是中央執行委員會以外統理全國軍政領導抗戰建國的最高機關，而以國民政府爲其政治執行機關，以軍委會爲其軍事執行機關，中央黨部爲其黨務執行機關，凡與抗戰建國有關的軍事政治黨務民運各種要務，都可由會議决定施行，其目的在於調節一切抗戰活動，增進全國人力物力，爭取最後勝利。我們囘顧抗戰一年半以來的事實，雖然各方面都已有了進步，但是各方面的缺點與障礙之嚴重存在，亦爲不可掩飾的事實，尤其是各級黨政民運機構之不獲適宜切實的調整，全國人力物力之不獲完善集中與統一支配，現在最高國防委員會組織成立，自將充分接受過去的經騐與教訓，更加推動軍事政治黨務民運的進步，以完成抗戰建國大業。</p>
<p>第二，五中全會决議組織成立的最高國防委員會，是抗日民族統一戰綫鞏固與擴展的產物，是適應抗戰建國新階段的民族聯盟，同時也是相當的代表人民公意的最高統帥部。該會委員包括黨政軍與文化領袖，國民黨員以外各黨各派領袖，亦被延請參加，如共黨領袖毛澤東與朱德，雖非參加組織，但亦受延聘。誠可譽爲「爲我國政治史創一新紀元」。抗戰以來民族統一戰綫日趨鞏固，民意機關如國民參政會開始表現其力量，但是其鞏固，其力量，却還是非常不够，相反的×人漢奸親日份子失敗主義者的挑撥離間陰謀活動，則竟猖獗萬分。去年十月中共六中全會之宣言誠心誠意擁護國民政府擁護蔣委員長，並提出加強全國團結，加強國共合作，鞏固統一戰綫，建立民族聯盟的具體辦法，其主要用意亦在克服×人離間破壞陰謀，爭取最後勝利，現在最高國防委員會組織成立，實際執行其民族聯盟以至人民國防最高機關的任務，不僅今後國共合作全國團結獲得更大保障，使一切×人漢奸親日份子失敗主義者，失去挑撥離間造謠破壞的機會，而且政府與人民中央與地方及軍事政治黨務民運各部門的相互關係，藉以更加密切，政府在人民中在國際上的威信，藉以更加增高，在東方民族革命史上，實闢最光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>然而我們要認淸最高國防委員會的組織成立，一方面是過去英勇抗戰一年半的經騐旗教訓的「結晶」，一方面只是爭取二期抗戰勝利基礎的建立，今後如何停止×人進攻發展後方建設推進我軍反攻爭取抗戰建國最後勝利，則有待於更英勇更認眞更適當的奮鬥。特別是在這抗戰第一階段轉向第二階段的時期，在這「爲山九仞」勝敗轉捩時期，×人最後也最猛烈最殘酷的進攻方在開始，×人漢奸和潛伏的親日份子失敗主義者「反共」「和平」「建立和平救國軍」建立中央政府』的陰謀活動，亦方在開始，我們要特別認淸當前時勢的艱危，特別是最高國防委會，在軍事上急須全部實施革命的新戰略，停止×人的進攻，發展反攻的準備；在政治上澈底改善各級政治機構，實現抗戰建國時期的民主政治與民生改善；在經濟上全部實現抗戰建國網領及這次五中全會的决議；在外交上及教育上更使用一切力量於反法西斯反侵略的抗日戰爭這個中心任務。此外尤須注意到（一）發展國民黨共產黨及一切抗戰黨派，集中一切力量到最高國防委員會領導之下，支持抗戰建國；（二）厲行鋤奸運動，澈底肅淸漢奸，×探，親日份子，失敗主義者，與一切漢奸傀儡組織，對於假借「和平救國」「反共救國」之名而行分化破壞我團結抗戰的主張，亦須痛加淸掃。</p>
<p>最高國防委員會的組織成立，無疑的將給日本法西斯侵略者以致命的打擊，而成爲中華民族求解放與遠東安全世界和平的偉大的保障力量，每一個不願做亡國奴的中華兒女與每一個主張正義和平要求自由的國際人士，都將為這個偉大力量的產生而狂歡而謳謌而振奮，我們要用更大的輸財輸力輸知識的熱誠，來答復我國政府這種進步，來擁護最高國防委員會順利遂行其偉大光榮的解放中華民筆爭取人類幸福的任務！</p>
<h3 id="c3">鶴山 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>西江南路的前衛</p>
<p>【本報特訊】鶴山，這是廣東西江南路的最前衛，它位置在西江的下游，把握着西江上下交通的孔道，在平時，它雖然僅祗是一個區區的三等縣，可是目從侵略者的×蹄踏進了我們祖國南方的海岸，南部的大都不守之後，它的地位就一日一日的隨着戰事的轉移而益加重要，×人假使要從西江進犯，那麼鶴山也是一條必經的道路，所以爲着使西江南路各地獲得保障，對於鶴山的固守是有必要的，如果鶴山——這西江南路的前衞能够始終固守，那麼侵略者蹂躪西江南路各地的冀圖，無疑地是要化爲夢幻。</p>
<p>我們從那個聳峙在廣東西化邊境的山地上底游擊之都——廣寧：輾轉跋涉了無數崎嶇的山路和那些被破壞的公路，在四天的長途步行之後，就到了這個作爲西江南路的前衛底鶴山。那是一月十三日下午四點鐘，我們帶着一雙疲乏的脚與一個疲乏的身子。跑進了鶴山縣的首鎭沙坪，這裏，距離我×兩軍對峙的海口，是只有十餘里的光景，隔河發射過來的炮聲，常常是那麼沉重地淸晣可聞，鶴山，它現在已經如同一個久經戰陣的勇武戰士，屹然而鎭定地站立在西江南路的最前綫，炮聲，機關槍聲以及飛機的轟炸，都不能使他呈現慌亂與惶恐，當我們的脚步第一下踏進沙坪時，它的景况，是大大地出乎我們的意想之外，誰會知道這一個距離前綫那麼近的市鎭，仍舊能够保持着如是的鎭定與如是的繁榮呢？</p>
<p>從廣寧到鶴山</p>
<p>從廣寧，這一個多山的地帶，這一個游擊之都，我們走過了兩天山間的道路，穿出了那西北部的叢山，離別了那斜躺在山崗上面的寂寞古城，走下一望出疇的高要平野，在高要縣境的禄步，趁乘輪船拖渡東下，當夜抵達了西江中部的重鎭——肇慶，第二天淸晨再從肇慶渡江，沿着那一條已經破壞掉的要明公路走到白土，在白土轉行一條山間的小路，傍晚就到高明城，明城距離戰綫雖然仍有相遙遠，但因飛機的轟炸與火藥氣的威脅，已經呈現出十分寂寞的樣子，我們在這裏住過了一夜，第二天就望着到沙坪的跳去。</p>
<p>六點鐘吃過早飯，我們就開始把昨天的疲乏還未卜分囘復的信，移上那新的旅程，這從山城到鶴山楊梅的一段路，又是一條山間的羊暢小徑，幸而這一條小路的行人還多，一方面，有從鶴山方面過來，準備經過明城轉入內地的行客，一方面又有那些從內地出來，準備經過鶴山而轉到海外去的行客。一方面又有哪些從內地出來，準備經過鶴山而步到海外的行客，尤其多的，是那些從內地販運水菓，香粉，竹篾和其他土產到鶴山江鬥去的挑夫和婦女，因為這是一條內地和海外交通的孔道，所以往來的人也就異樣的多，一條迂迴四十餘里的山路，絡繹不絕的都是行客和挑夫，確有相當的熱鬧。</p>
<p>高明和鶴山交界的地方，有一個小小的墟集，這就是楊梅（並不是三水的楊梅），從前，楊梅只是一個不大旺盛的小墟場，可是自從鶴高公路破壞之後，鶴高間的交通，就以它這裏爲最便捷，走這一條路的人漸漸的增多，於是它也就隨而繁盛起來，當人們從那蜿蜓的山徑中跑了出來，走過那一個低小的山崗，首先映入眼簾的，就是那一大羣聚集在墟前的挑伕和轎伕，像是一羣螞蟻一樣，萬頭攢動，眞是蔚爲奇觀，轎——那些簡單得只有兩根竹槓，一塊坐板，一根落脚棍的轎，一排一排的放在地上，看來，至少要有一二百乘，情形的熱鬧，真是前所未所，至於墟塲裏面的擁擁，自不待言。</p>
<p>自楊梅出沙坪，又是四十餘里的山徑，下知爲甚麼，過了楊梅之後、山徑中的行人就琉落起來，愈走得深，人就愈少，一直到走出了龍口，人纔再多起來，這已經不是走的山徑，而是破壞了的公路，沿着沙金——沙坪至金屬——公路，步行十餘里，於是就踏進沙坪。</p>
<p>沙坪一瞥</p>
<p>今日的沙坪，已經不僅是一個商業中心的市鎭，而且已經是一個軍事上的據點，它距離×我對峙的海口，只有十里左右的公路，而距離那已被×人焚毀了的古勞，也不過十餘里，當廣州不守的消息傳到這裏，以及九江被×人蹂躪的炮聲傳來的時候，它的確有過一個紛亂的恐慌的局面，然而不久，它就仍舊鍋靜，夾而且堅强起來。</p>
<p>沙坪車站，雖然經過太大牌的鐵鳥多次的轟襲，可是它依舊是那麼倔强地健在，我們就在車站旁邊的一家旅館裏歇了脚，然後再到街道上去巡閱一遍，以前，沙坪的崇德沙塲一帶，原是非常繁盛的地方，不過自從崇德路一帶被轟炸過之後，這裏就冷落了，現在是只有幾担菜難擺在那裏，行人也不多，商店雖然仍在開門，顧客却很少，昔日摩肩接踵的盛况，已經侈到市的中心，在那裏，行人和小販，都擠擁不堪，至於銀行路，原是鶴山金融的中心，平時一切銀錢業，匯兌業和銀行錢莊，那開設在這裏。道路非常整齊潔凈，自從炸後，情形就大異昔時，那些銀號錢莊，大都閉門歇業，但是其餘各業，却大都與往昔無殊。</p>
<p>沙坪的食物店，茶樓與餐館，生意都非常好，因爲來往經過的人多，所以他賺賺的錢也就不少，這裏更有一所冰室，有各種牛奶，咖啡之類的飲品和西餅憊客，這確是從廣寧到鶴山一路所無的。除了冰室之外，這裏又有一所女子理髮室，那些髮姬，雖然在×兵咫尺，炮火連天中間，印仍然能够濃塗厚抹，輕裳曲鬢，巧笑橫眸的來與顧客相週旋。他們的顧客，大多是孤單的旅人，彼此言談歡笑，一室之中，宛有昇平氣象，使人忘却眼前的烽火。</p>
<p>住在沙坪的民衆，對於那些經常地聽到的炮聲，好像一點也不感釗甚麼似的，他們自己仍在做着他們的買賣，圍在江湖客賣膏藥的攤子前面看把戯的閑人，雖然是看不到緊張，但是却澴鎮定。</p>
<p>從沙坪到維墩</p>
<p>在沙坪的北街口，坐了一艘小小的蓬艇到維墩去，這是一條很小很狹的河道。沿着這條小河，端可通到海口谷埠，一端可以通到昇平派古勞，昇平鎭和古營這一帶；總的名字就呌維墩，它包括了好幾個墟市和很多的村落，因爲它被一條圍基圍着，而且裏面池塘錯落，河涌雜流，</p>
<p>小艇在昇平鎭（土名道口墟，諧廣州音變成大口墟墟只有一條街道，小是十分的小，可是自從古勞給×人曉光之後，古勞方面一切的商業都移到昇平鎭這方面來進行，所以我們登岸的時候雖已近視，而街道上的人却依舊有那麼的多。士敏士的街道，弄得又潮濕又污穢，走起來脚步浮浮滑滑的，幾乎要跌倒，這裏，並沒有客寓的設備，只好再走那些曲折的桑陌—路到幾里外的鄕下去住。</p>
<p>這一個鄕名叫舊仁和，這裏的居民大多是姓馬和姓李的，從×軍進犯古勞以來，他們大都不曾離開過自己的村莊，對於×人每天從河清沙口兩地掃過來的機關鎗，大炮，以及飛到維墩一帶上空來偵察投彈的飛機，他們都已經習以爲常了，他們捕魚的仍在捕魚，撈蝦的仍在勞蝦，一切的生活，跟平時並沒有兩樣，雖然這裏立刻就要變爲火線了。</p>
<p>第二天淸早，在炮聲，機關鎗聲，飛機聲和炸彈聲的交響之中，從舊仁和冉跑到昇平鎮，鎭上的居民，一點也不覺得怎樣的，依然在做着買賣，在墟尾一家粥店吃了一碗魚肉粥，間那賣粥的老婦，這些鎗聲炮聲是否天天都有的，她答說以前是大天都有，一星胡來是已經沉寂了，只從昨天起，才再有這種鎗炮聲的，末後她說：</p>
<p>「怕甚麼呢！他們是過不來的！」</p>
<p>吃完粥，再沿看圍基前行到雙橋市去，愈前行，槍炮聲就愈加來得響亮，走了二十分鐘，就到了雙橋市，雙橋市距離古勞很近，河淸×軍轟過來的炮彈，曾經打在它的附近，在到雙橋市的道中，圍基上的一顆大榕樹被轟去一邊，好幾間民房，又被另一顆炮彈坍塌了。可是有一點，在這×人炮彈的射稈內的雙橋市，它的旺盛，仍然不下於昇半鎭，趁墟的人，依然是一樣的熙攘來往，儘管那些炮聲，機關鎗聲，飛機聲和炸彈聲在耳邊亂響，人們却一樣的在交易，在生活，安祥之狀，令人不可置信。</p>
<p>在雙橋市逗留不到幾分鐘，就趕囘昇平鎮叫小挺划囘沙坪，途中，不斷的炸彈聲和炮聲，仍在隆隆的亂響。</p>
<p>回釗沙坪，已經是午間十二點，趕快跑路到玉崗，乘江佛公路那僅餘的一小段汽車到雙龍，冉行徒步到江門，又是黃昏時候了。（一九三九年元月廿五日晨。）</p>

<p>— 本報記者筆記</p>
<p>——昨天在本港女青年會——</p>
<p>目前硏究「抗戰現勢」這憫問題是很必要的。因爲自廣州失陷，武漢撤退之後，邇短短兩三個月時間，却充滿着迅速的，進步的種種變化。</p>
<p>去年十一月廿五日在衡山舉行的軍事會議，把武漢撤退以即割爲抗戰第一時期，撤退以後，劃爲第二時期。第一二期的現勢，有着很明顯的區別。</p>
<p>衡山會議對于第二期抗戰的軍事，經濟，政治……等部門，都有重要的决定，直至最近五中全會再加以具體的討論與最後的决定。</p>
<p>現在，將第二期抗戰的新現勢爲諸位報吿一下，</p>
<p>軍事方面：可以分爲四點來講：</p>
<p>第一，戰略方面</p>
<p>第一期抗戰我們是處於被動的地位應戰：從上海退至南京，從南京退至徐州，從徐州退至武漢，雖然亦盡了消耗×人的任務，可是，還未能達到處于殲滅×人的主動地位。蔣委員長在衡山會議說今後游擊戰重要過正規戰，把我們所有的兵力分配三分之一到前線和×人作戰，三分之一的兵力用來鞏固我們的後方。再用三分之一的兵力襲擊×人的後方，使×人的前後左右四方八面都受到我們的包圍。×人不但不能達到速戰速决的迷夢，根本就沒有兵力分派到廣大的戰場，從新戰略看來，我們是有着勝利的把握。</p>
<p>第二，地勢方面</p>
<p>第二期抗戰的地勢是深入到西南西北的高原與山野地帶。×人的海軍不能施其威力，空軍的迷用亦感困難。陸軍的機械化部隊亦處處要碰到地理上的阻礙，所以，這地勢，是最不利於×人，而最有利於我軍。我們誘×深入之後，終有一天把×人的主力殲滅，所以，從地勢方面，我們亦有着勝利的把握。</p>
<p>第三，人力方面</p>
<p>我們積極在動員全民的力量參加抗戰，事實上，我們的民氣，士氣亦是愈打愈强。政治重於軍事的决定，亦是衡山會議之後的急轉進步現象。反觀×人，侵華軍人巳在一百萬以上，超過原計劃不知要多少倍。日本的力量是有限的，再增兵是不能了。所以在人力方面，我們是勝於×人，我們又有着勝利的把握。</p>
<p>第四，兵器方面</p>
<p>有人以爲×人的兵器勝過我們，其實，第一期抗戰是如此，第二期可就不同了。×人的海陸空軍失了作用，在上面已經說過。至於我們中國呢，空軍在西南西北一分鐘估二分鐘的工夫，一年多來，我們的空軍巳有迅速的進步了。</p>
<p>今後决定勝負主要的是在陸軍，我們的機械化精銳部隊最少是在二十師以上。比×人是多了好幾倍。這些精銳部隊多數是準備到總反攻時，一舉殲滅×人。這是實實在在的事實。</p>
<p>試看廣州失陷後三個月來，×人的進展是很少的。這並非是×人的停止進攻。而是力量消耗殆盡。陷於泥淖之苦。現在雖然有時憑藉其海軍的力量。在北海，西江，長江等處，有躍躍欲試的模樣，但是，這亦只限於騷擾而已，而却沒有多大的力量可以進攻了。</p>
<p>×人處於這樣困難的境况之下，自然是希望早日結束戰爭。所以，遂有去年十二月近衞均和平宣言，所提的條件，並不像從前那樣苛刻了。遭就可以看出×人是怎樣困迫的苦况。</p>
<p>但是，我們是不是要上×人的圈套和他們講和平呢？這只有漢奸與無識之徒才有這樣的夢想，在第一期抗戰中，我們處於很多不利的情况下，尙且能够苦撐了—八個月。現在我們已經是處於絕對有利的情况，×人是到了××的時候，此時來講和平，來屈服，邪只有漢奸才甘心出賣整個良族的利益。（聽衆熱烈鼓掌）</p>
<p>所以，第二期抗戰，軍事方面，無論是戰略，地勢，人力，以及兵器，都是我們勝于×人，我們絕對操着勝利的把握。</p>
<p>接着，我們再看看第二期抗戰的政治現象，那是更可樂觀了。</p>

<p>【上海通訊】中日戰事發生以來、南北各地海關，間有因華方陣地變更、陷於特殊環境、政府對於海關主權行政、頗爲關切，正規劃改進、茲誌各情如次</p>

<p>養老金均改購外匯</p>
<p>海關職員、例有月儲養老金之訂定、於退職時頒給、此項數目、殊爲可觀、自中日戰事陡起，海關方面、當將各關員月儲養老金原已購存公債者、改購外匯、一年以來、因外匯之升高、所有應領退職養老金之職員，均因購進外匯後價格上漲之原因、所領養老金、幾較戰前增加一倍、然此種外匯上之增益、純爲戰時利潤、退職關員當以此種利潤、間接卽爲增加國家外匯之支出、頗多向中央陳述、以本人旣係國家一公務員、當此戰事正在進行、各省公務員旣多半折薪發給、退聯關員、何忍於例外獲此外匯上之利益、聞財政部對述職關員之意見、正在調查情形、再行决定處理辦法、</p>
<p>房貼辦法嚴禁浮報</p>
<p>海關職員例有貼房租等等名目、於月薪之外、另行支給之、向例規定、亦極嚴格、較高職員、大約爲每月五十元、惟採實報實銷制、而以五十元爲度、距兮不久、曾有海關一職員、以所居一十餘元之房租、混報五十元、嗣爲總稅務司所知、以其浮報、下令斥革、並通令各海關對於關員房租貼費、是否確實、應嚴密調查、如有浮報，立予撤懲、</p>
<p>日籍關員相當增加</p>
<p>江海關稅款、自去年七月間解送中央後、迄今未曾照解，總稅務司梅樂和將此項情形、呈報財政部、至該關最近行政上情况、外班職員日籍者有相當增加、其原因多由於目前之應付關係、一般認爲當係短時期之特殊情形、若干時期後、自可恢復原狀、至於進出口關單、近來日商方面頗有要求增用日文者、海關當局以向例報單爲華英文兩種、故對此項請求、迄未加以考慮、</p>

<p>自戰事延及華南以來，本港人口驟增，業主與房客間，時其紛於是立法局有「一九三八年限制迫遷法」之訂定。近來國內風雲益急，來港僑居者有加無已，一時社會環境所需要，僅如上法所訂，尙感不足。今日立法局開會，修訂各項法案，律政司對於限制迫遷法案，聞將加以修改。此誠福利僑港居民之善政，抑亦維持本港社會秩序之惟一要務也。</p>
<p>抑思居住一問題，表面爲業主與房客的關係。實則業主房客外，尙有從中取利之人，因而增加房客苦難，使業主爲之代受種種惡名。此人爲誰？即俗所稱包租人中之一部份是。包租爲相沿已久之習慣，包租人亦非盡爲借此營利之輩，特其中有少數不良者，借包租人名義，以陰行其不利於房客，並使　主代爲受過之非法行動。而對外江人，以語言隔閡，尤多出於情理以外之壓迫。例如鞋金一名詞，頂租一習慣，彼即可借之取巧，利用業主　屋，以迫取房客不應出之錢財。其實鞋金者，乃代業主跑路血給予之鞋錢。在業主實爲不需要之　規，彼反可偽爲壓租之音訛，而强取房客數十元之多。頂租爲通常租單中業主所不允許之一條，彼可稱爲慣例，而隨時頂出，隨時迫遷，因以展轉出入，取用無窮。其他類此或甚於此者，尤難一數。</p>
<p>總之，業主迫遷，猶爲人所共知，包租人迫遷，則未說爲人所注意。前者旣有法案以爲限制，後者爲害，不僅及於房客，並於業主多所不利，反未聞有何制裁之法律，其不平孰甚。茲爲本港社會人羣福利計，特提出之，以供立法局之參考。</p>
<h3 id="c38">歐洲綏靖成功？ <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>英首相張伯倫卅一日晚在下院報吿，說英意羅馬會談雖無特殊成就，但歐洲綏靖政策業已奏功，確信德意同具和平願望。好像張伯倫妥協外交政策巳吿成功，事實又是如何？</p>
<p>是的，張伯倫是成功了，但成功的不是歐洲和平，而只是×××所領導的獨佔資本領袖所計劃的擴大戰事。事實很明顯，羅馬會談以後，意大利侵略者西班牙獲得勝利，德國侵略者重申瓜分殖民地嬰求，歐洲戰爭危機提前了一步，獨佔資本領袖獲利的機會更增多了。然而，英法兩國×××却××××，民主和平勢力却更被抑制，因此綏靖的成功不是平靜而是未來大戰的瘋狂準備！</p>
<p>其實我們這種觀察絕對不是臆測或武斷．世界具有遠見的人士都有同感．美國參議院外交委會中參議員金氏卽曾指出「希特勒墨索里尼二人已有改變版圖的陰謀」，可是張氏所謂「綏靖成功』將是法西斯侵略者鎭壓民主與和平勢力的成功．而英國自由黨領袖辛克萊氏更在英下院當眾指出」吾A（指英國）雖然重整武裝，在國外已漸失去重要强大之力量的擁護！』這是値得英國正義人士促其政府猛省的。</p>
<h3 id="c39">新加坡軍事根據地概況 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— （約翰根塞原著　宏聲譯）</p>
<p>新加坡根據地的建築費用實在可觀，說也奇怪，這筆巨大的款子都從　片中得來。據官方估計，根據地的全部造價是八千〇五十五萬美金，其中海軍根據地一項，就費了三千八百五十萬至四千五百萬。</p>
<p>那個浮船渠計値四百八十萬五千，從窩耳增　到新加坡的拖引費是一百萬，其中包括蘇彝士運河的通過稅五萬，賽萊泰的空軍根據地値三百五十五萬，還有兩個　用飛機楊各値一百七十五萬。</p>
<p>可是，非官方的估計還不止此，假使把軍官士卒的餉糈，以及一切間接費用併算在內的話，所費不下二萬萬五千萬美金。</p>
<p>這一筆欵項的來源不一：海峽殖民地供給賽萊泰的土地，計値七十五萬，新西蘭出五百萬，香港出一百二十五萬。澳大利亞沒有拿出錢來，不過建設了一枝海軍。</p>
<p>新加坡上面那個富足的馬來亞半島，是分爲直屬與非直屬兩部分的。直屬部份——歸英國本部直接管轄，——供給一百萬現金與價値一百五十萬的二枝皇家派遣飛行隊。非直屬部份的政治獨立程度並不勝於直屬部份，其中佐和耳的蘇丹供給二百五十萬。總計上述各項協款，共二千一百萬，約佔根據地總値的四分之一稍弱</p>
<p>還有，到一九三三年爲止，海峽殖民地又供給現金六千萬本幣，（一元本幣等於美金五角八分）一九三三以後，又助常年定額協欵。年四百萬本幣，外加最近三年來的特別欵項本幣一百五十萬。所以海峽殖民地所献於根據地者，總計不下八千一百五十萬本幣，約合美金四千七百五十萬元。</p>
<p>把海峽殖民地所出現金加上上述各項協欵，總數是六千八百五十萬美金。把這一個數目從　値的八千〇五十五萬美金上減去，得差數一千二百〇五萬，就是英國本部預算項下所支。實在便宜極了，除掉常年維持二百五十萬不計，新加坡根據地所求於英國本部者，眞是微乎其微了。</p>
<p>海峽殖民地的全部歲入，有百分之二十是由鴉片賣員中得來，這一樁寶買是政府的獨佔事業，英國從伊朗或印度買鴉片原料來，製成土膏，裝在一種小型的金屬管子裏。鴉片原料一元本幣可以買一新加坡兩（合一又三分之一盎司）；而一兩土膏却要　幣十二元。利息是可觀的，不過也是寓禁於徵的意思，故意把價格抬高了來減少銷路的。</p>
<p>土　的銷售，統制極嚴；只有登記過的癮君子才可以購風，而欲加入　君子之　則須醫師証明。</p>
<p>幾年前，政府鑒於鴉片運輸也許要遭國　聯合行動的禁止，所以頒布了一種鴉片簪補基金的辦法，在每年的鴉片稅項下抽出百分之十另行保管，這一筆基金現已積至三千萬本幣，儘可以不必再增加了。所以說，　三萬五千個登記過的烟民簡直担負了海峽殖民地所協助給根據地的欵項中的五分之一。</p>
<p>根據地落成的那一天，因了美國的艦隊的蒞臨，引起了世界上不少人的張皇，在這一次的中日戰事中，日本勢力日益南進，新加坡根據的完成，當然會給予日本以相當　色的。</p>
<p>不久，英國又聲明，「如遇必要時，英國準備將海軍新根據地的一切設備，租偕給美國應用」。換一句話說，就是如有戰事發生，英國將倒展以迎美國人到新加坡來。</p>
<p>一方面，美國人也是何樂而不爲，因爲夏威夷以西她沒有　以修理大船隻的地方，一旦遠東有事，新加坡的船渠正可以應她的需要哩。</p>
<p>依照最可靠的軍事觀察結果，根據地只有在正北大陸一條路有受敵人攻擊的可能。海上進擊簡直是不可能的，而空襲　只可以使根據地受損而不能佔領。敵人企圖佔新加坡，只有用步兵在馬來亞或暹羅登陸，然後冉南下，這就是要在這兩地方增加軍用機場的原因。</p>
<p>新加坡的最最可取之處，是他的位置，距馬尼刺只有一五七八哩，距香港只有一六七四哩，而距橫濱却有三三四五哩。雖然日本止在台　建築一個重要空軍根據地，不過想用海軍全力進攻，則非　少加足三千哩行程的火力不爲功，而這樣的行程巳經超過現代出征軍艦應有的限度了。</p>
<p>事實上，海軍戰爭的主要對象是商業而不是敵艦，太平洋戰爭的重要任務之一，是遮斷日本商船的交通，再加上一個封鎖，便可以致日本的死命了。要達到這一個目的，新加坡是最理想的了。</p>
<p>再有，新加坡的鄰土，又是絕對安全的地方，馬來亞可以說是沒有政治活動，如民族運動之類存在的，試想把英國的軍事根據地放在埃及，伊拉克或是印度，那裏的政治情勢實在是一個很嚴重的問題。並且新加坡有最完美的空軍設備，比沒有好機塲的直波羅陀方便多多了</p>
<p>所以把軍事力量集中在新加坡，有好幾種作用，給英國海軍一個儲油庫與修理船渠，使香港有了武力的後盾，同時保衛了澳洲，科侖坡與加爾加答，在英國的殖民地中心建立了一個裝甲防禦樓，成爲歐亞交通的總樞紐。</p>
<p>最要者，他給予日本一個警吿，根據地彷彿堅决地吿訴日本，英國在世界的這一方面，永不願把商業利益放棄的。說到這一點，不禁使人想起羅伯次元帥生前說過的一句話，總有一天世界的歷史要在新加坡决定，也許英國正在等著這一天的到來。</p>

<h3 id="c49">港存米北運問題 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 雋人</p>
<p>××××××。爲此，記者特走訪米行公所主席楊永庥，對于上述事件，有所叩詢討論，楊先生對於這個問題詳細的加以分析，據他說：</p>
<p>「香港對於米石的經營，大致有三個階段。第一個階段是南北行，南北行是直接採運安暹米石的機關，但僅是代理性質，安濯米主有權可以指定售賣與某一顧客，南北行無干涉的可能，等到成交，南北行替米主交了貨，任務便算完畢，所得的利益，就是若干的佣金；至第二個階段就是米行公所，米行公所可以說是拆家的集團，他們向南北行購了一批貨，拆成較小的數量分發米店零售，只限於本港，絕不運到外地，第三個階段是米業公會，那是米店的集團，他們對於這個問題，更無足重視，因爲他們僅是零售的米店，購人的數量旣不多，也再沒有大批運出的可能。</p>
<p>「我們旣明白香港經營米業的情形，對於存米北運問題，便可加以檢討：實任既不在米行公所，也和米業公會無干，然則是南北行的責任罷？但也不能說是，卽如上面所談，南北行只是代理性質，絕對沒有選擇顧主的能力，×××××××</p>
<p>「其次，還有一點要注意的，山東帮和天津帮與南北行的交易，有了幾十年的歷史關係，在戰事之前，每年是不斷的把南貨米石之類北運，同時把北貨運到南方來，這樣一來一往，就是他們討飯吃的業務，幾十年來，從沒有間勵。等到中日戰事發生，沿海遭×封鎖，對於南北貨運，亦受影響，中間有過二個時期是陷於停頓的，天雲帮山東帮和南北行的交易，也因而中國。及至去歲末，抗戰轉人新的階段，因爲港口的好轉，南北航業也漸次恢復，津魯帮因此亦繼續採購貨品北運，南北貿易，逐漸回復舊觀。米石固然是他們採購的貨品中的主要之一種。目前，香港仔米北運，或許是事實，</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>客子過蜀者、雖走馬看花、亦必有二點　象、不可磨滅、其一爲由、其二爲霧、舟過宜昌、卽如螻蟻穿珠、終日在山縫中覓路、直抵重慶、形勢依然、冬李水枯、長江一線、深陷山底、而兩岸乃益拔峭、未出夔門者、當不信揚子江下游浩瀚之勢也。</p>
<p>重慶地勢如半島、山脈一行、界於揚子嘉陵兩江之間、揚子之南、沿山居人、街中村落、若斷若續、統稱之曰南岸、嘉陵之北、一城高踞山嶺、與重慶對峙、則爲江北縣、旅客乘舟西來、至兩江合流處、但見四面山光、三方市影、煙霧迷離、乃不知何處爲重慶、或以爲重慶形勢、若武漢三鎭之具體而微、實則武漢偉大、江巴雄險、固亦未見其微也、</p>
<p>重慶因山建市、街道極錯落之能事、舊街巷坡道高低、行路頻頻上下、新街道則大度迂迴、行路又展轉需時、故下遊人至此、問道訪友、首感不適、但若都郵街會仙橋小梁子諸地、則崇樓夾道、上達五六層、其下柏油路如帶一環、行人蟻聚、亦彷彿近代化之都市矣、</p>
<p>此間地價不昂、而地勢崎嶇、無可展拓、故建屋者、由高臨下、朋削山爲坡、居卑面高、則文崖作閣、平面不得開展、乃從事於屋上下之堆疊、屋向上得、爲樓爲閣、人盡知之、向下亦云堆疊者、此則爲蜀中之特獨建築、其法或沿坡支屋、逐漸斜下、或坡下作懸閣、其上架樓二三層，以超出地面、故他處出門必須下樓、而此地上樓乃得出門、亦爲常事、驟覩比項建築者、無不引以爲坏、猶憶一次訪友、門前朱戶獸環、儼然世家、門啓乃空洞無物、白雲任望、俯視則降堦二三十級爲庭院、立於門首、視其瓦紋如指掌也、不亦趣乎、</p>
<p>建樓爲蜀中常事、而需費則奇廉、蓋鋼骨水泥、建築固所罕用、卽四面磚牆、基礎堅固者、亦不易得、大都以木作架、以竹編壁、一客登樓、全屋俱動、平民世居、習不爲怪、又如通衢商肆、樓高十丈、窗飾輝煌、百貨羅列、觀其外表、儼然滬漢模樣也、顧叩其牆壁、則蓬蓬然如擊鼓皮、蓋係砌磚作柱、於兩柱之間、釘木條雙層作夾壁者、夾壁上糊泥灰、若牆厚尺許、其實中空無物、不堪拳擊、近商民難覺其不當、有意改善、然全市翻造、非易言也、</p>
<p>遊川者有言、成都如小北平、重慶如小上每、以人情風俗言、大抵近是、唯其重慶旣追隨上海，故城在重嵐疊嶂之間、反無林泉之佈置、客欲作郊外遊者、當渡江至海棠溪、（西南公路首站）更乘長途汽車十五公里至南溫泉、作竟日之遊、　溫泉簡稱南泉、俗又稱南溫塘、車站近處、於兩山閒得一淸溪、淸風徐來、水波不興、駕溪中小艇緩緩前進、凡五六里、乃達塲所、（四川稱鄕鎭爲塲、故趕集曰趕塲）、場中有公園、靑年會旅館、餐社、儼然　市、泉則備蓄爲游泳池、闢肆售票、另有小浴室、　時放水、俾旅客就浴、泉溫度略高於吾人之髁溫、征塵小滌、足暢襟懷、蓋溫泉之佳者、就全　言，微峯夾峙、中凹淺谷、亦殊不惡、但塲屋零亂、特　整理耳、</p>
<p>城區中有一公園、乃闢高坡之一部分爲之、雖略植花木、配以亭榭、顧地在鬧市，毫無曲折、除在長亭茶社可啜茗俯瞰長江外、他不足取、居重慶而必欲稍近自然、當道出新市區、北過上淸寺、順成渝公路前行前、小步　圖關山腰、其地為半島之頸項、翠峯高聳、林木葱籠、嘉陵江蜿蜓而來、深居路下數百尺、白帆如羽、遠入山縫而沒深有畫意、嘗於暮春偕友來此、時烟消日出、見夾江峯巒、重重環抱、江流不知何所自來、蜀道艱難、於是可見、川境多杜宇、綠葉深深、滿山亂啼、攀條望工水東行、念唐人詩、「頻將兩行淚、寄向故圜流』之句、與友人咨　不置、</p>
<p>浮圖關指山顛而言、舊有塔、已無、登山則左揚子而右嘉陵、兩江若雙玉帶、環繞山　、瞭如指掌、徘徊四顧、雲峯霧嶂、令人有山河漂渺之感、峯側有人築園、略佈邱壑、投刺可遊、</p>
<p>寓　慶而欲遊覽探勝、必出遠道、至近亦須渡江而南、春二三月、遍山桃李花開、司遊南山、夏日樹木陰濃、可遊老君洞、但筆者客意闌珊、屢言遊而屢阻、愧無以告讀者、北培在川東、若浙江之西湖、至渝者必以一遊爲快、愚亦迭違友約、徒減雅興、更無論於峨嵋靑城之遠道登臨矣、</p>
<p>四川氣候溫和、冬無苦冷、故梧桐晚周、榆楊早葉、成都名爲芙蓉城、而重慶亦復百花俱備、山城有花市三四處、逐日羅列紅紫、備客挑選、且花價極綫、攻瑰盈把、不過一角、木樨巨枝、僅索數分、而牡丹茉莉白蘭均肯剪枝出售、爲他處所未有、當筆者作稿時、室中羅菊花五六瓶、蓮瓣蟹爪、各種　佳、耗資僅僅二三角、案頭一瓶、且與水仙同供、此固江北花癡、所未及夢見者也、</p>
<p>人或有言、貴陽烏烟瘴氣、重慶暗無天日、謔語、亦事實也、就愚在川所經歷、大抵國曆十一月、開始入霧瘴時期、至明年三月始漸漸明朗、卽明朗矣、亦陰雨時作、不能久晴、苟非久慣旅行，貿然入川、健康必難久持、其在霧罩時期、畫無日光、夜無星月、畏空作深灰色、不辨時刻、晨昏更多濕霧、雲氣彌漫、甚至數丈外混然無覩、故春夜月華、冬日朝曦、蜀人實所罕見、又此間無大風、亦鮮霜雪、草木禓茂，殆由是歟、</p>
<p>人但知蜀人嗜辣，而不知蜀人亦嗜甜、此間於茶坊酒肆之外、另有甜食店、店中專售栆糕　葉等食品、而鷄油湯團一項、尤膾炙人口、或謂在昔煙禁未申、此所以爲癮君予設者、然觀於渝人酒席、恆多甜食、上說恐不盡然、有夾沙肉一項者、以肥肉切片夾豆泥爛熟、更以重糖醮食、令人望之生長、而渝人則目爲珍品、此亦嗜甜之一證也、至於飯必備椒屬、此爲普通現象、愚亦嗜辣、與川人　、膛乎其後、唯川人正式宴客、則辣品不上席、江南人有應川人之約者、固不必以椒薑為懼耳、</p>
<p>四川為天府之國、舉世所知、然近年時移事　、富在上層、故新市區週圍十餘里、紅樓碧檻、參雜峯嵐竹木間、出通遠門、至上淸寺、又一南京之山西路上、嘗數叩　室之門、其建築之精、設備之週、即上海寓公之家、或未及是、若初來之客、不幸由臨江門登岸、見竹牆木屋、平民鷄棲鴿聚於其</p>
<p>廣東謂客籍者　外江佬、四川則謂客籍者為下江人，其人茍不能操西方官話、（川滇黔）雖來自甘靑、亦在下江之列、　川諺謂下方曰腳底、故下江人俗又統稱之曰脚底下人、苟客不悉其由、乍聞之、必當勃然色變、其　習慣如此、固無侮辱之意也、自去年十月起、腳底下人與腳底下貨、充溢重慶市上、市招　展、不書南京、郎書上海、而小步五支衢頭、南北方言、　洋盈耳、客主之勢旣移、上下江之別、殆亦維持不易矣、</p>
<p>川菜馳名國內、殆與粵榮分庭抗禮、年來南北都市、川菜館林立、其與旺可知、顧至渝市、則純粹川菜館、營業黯澹、無可稱述、其尙足當一名　鼓者、乃爲由京滬回蜀之庖人、以下江川菜為號召，於是吾人恍然在　門　外所嘗之川菜、非眞川菜也、渝市大小吃食館本極多、幾為五步一樓、十步一閣、客民麕集之後、平津京蘇廣東菜館、如春筍怒　、愈覺觸目皆是、大抵北味　盛行、粵味次之、京蘇館又居其次、目主持得人、營業皆不惡、其理由如下、冠　雲集、宴會究難盡免、一也、入川之人、半無眷屬、視　　爲家庖、二也、純　之思、人所俱有、客多數日一　家鄉風味、三也、　　就地取材，設置　易、四也、至西餐則渝地無　者、近受限制、餐價不得超過一元、因之餐館縮其量爲兩菜一湯、麵包亦限一片、人縱喜　刀叉、每盒不得果腹、則亦望望然去、若食時加菜、其價亦特昂、事非必需、故此業不振云、</p>
<p>重慶浴室、簡陋不如下江、然有三特點、可資談助、（一）每家浴室均有家庭間、携眷同浴、固屬正當、召妓戯謔、亦非所忌、（二）江上有船上浴室、亦分等級售座、筆者因聞不甚淸、未嘗問津、然想象就江煮水、雖甚便利、而篷　侷促、當不甚舒適也、（三）此地放館、均兼營浴室、家庭間論時不論人、亦一奇矣、</p>
<p>出境故有代步、長途爲馬、爲滑竿、市區則用轎、轎為便於上下坡、乃兩竹　、架一竹製之小座、質甚輕、橋扛亦異他處、前短而後修、滑竿狀如其　、以座竹竿夾一竹片所編之　簾、以廉腹端下凹、恰可爲座、座上鋪衾褥、若繩床、更於竿上支竹技、覆以布帳、人半臥其中、俯仰不移重心、爲狀甚適、川西北一帶　盆地中、尙有雙輪小車、製法甚古、行時、乘者在前、推者在後、彷彿鍾進十嫁妹圖中物也、</p>
<p>川人無論男女、喜頭緾白布、目緾法極簡單、細布如巨繩、置一圈於頭上、苟屬新製、儼然下江人在重孝中、問何以故、則答以頭懼風寒、問何不戴帽、則答以纏布其値較賤、其實布與帽之値、亦不甚懸殊也、川人頭懼寒矣、而脚則懼熱、中下階級男子、十九赤脚草履、在塞冬時、上衣長袍、下赤雙足、招搖過市、無以爲怪者、蜀道艱難、民愛着草履、自屬有由、唯國人舊習、最忌白色上頭、而川人緾白布、陸放翁已形之於吟咏、未悉始於何時、而獨與全國習俗相反也、</p>
<p>川戯在梨園行中、亦獨樹一幟、詞句側重字面典雅、一覽其劇本、　　滿紙、與粵劇同、唯在台上搬演時、唱者由腳色自由行腔、無絲索配音、至煞尾一句、往往金　絲　、嘩然並奏、樂場十餘人、大聲疾呼、同音相和、苟非習聞、頗覺毛戴、此所謂下里巴人和者寒歟、至表演細膩、亦有皮簧所未及者、大抵悲劇則聲淚俱下、喜劇則褻蕩備至、劇中人出色當行、均肯極情描寫、旅客或有川劇之嗜、决非有求於歌唱、乃可　言、</p>
<p>山地如貴州、處處皆石、旣屬不毛、高原如甘肅、粘士無骨、更無水源、亦徒見其博大、唯四川之山、其下爲石、其上爲土、高處植林、低處樹榖、無一寸廢地、氣候溫和、有年可三四收穫者、卽就水果言、北方之梨　、南方之荔枝、重慶皆備、且為期甚早、嘗於三月啖櫻桃、八月嚼橄欖、橘柚之佳、尤推獨步、其廣柑一項、與滬上所售之花旗橘子、色香味三項、無二些差、當具　匝月之後、一元可購二百枚、使下江人早知國內有此佳果、當已奪美橘之席而有之矣、</p>
<p>文人若少女善懷、作客尤甚、爲此文　、信筆所之、有不禁感慨繫之者、自讀一渦、輒復棄去、今茲於讀者所見、殆拉雜中十之五六、好在　憶隨　，自成段片、初不覺　有所劃裂、他日重返江南、當取道滇黔桂粵、必更有所貢献於讀者、今日言之未盡者、爾日或有以補其不足也、山河迢遞、念我友生、歲云暮矣、謹祝百福、</p>

<p>（上海通訊）「一二八」滬戰七週年紀念、本市華人體育界各項運動比賽、如私上中盃小球、中華盃兵兵等一律停賽、中西慈善籃球二次賽、原定是晚舉行、因滬戰紀念關係、改至二月二日交鋒、又女子乒乓錦標賽因『一二八』關係提前一日揭幕、上聯乒乓會各所屬乒乓隊、於是日全體茹素一天、以誌紀念、各體育團體並發衣對於『一二八』紀念之感想、及今後體育界應有之認識一文、略稱際此滬戰七週年之今日、吾人於沉痛紀念之餘、深感本市體育界對抗戰應有更澈底與更進一步之認識、而能間接或直接的增强我抗戰力量、（一）多舉辦或參加難　救濟賽、（二）普遍推廣體育使市民體格健全、（三）誘導頹廢靑年使轉向嗜好體育之路、（四）嚴密防止體育界漢奸活動、（五粉碎傷體育會）之夢想，凡此種種、深盼體育界人士羣起担負、民族前途、實深賴之云云、</p>

<p>（本報特訊）近日本港球迷、多關心於港菲埠際足球比賽之　代表人選題、昨閱士蔑西文晚報、見該報體育記者筆名『愛勃』Abe者、亦擬有一陣綫、其意大概謂現目距離　際賽之時日無多、足球總會縱或對人選已胸有成竹、然亦非及早宣佈、俾能早日聯合作試賽以收聯絡之效不爲功、據其擬定之陣綫則爲：</p>
<p>譚均幹（南華華）</p>
<p>李天生（南華南）雷米迪（聖約瑟）</p>
<p>士地路（海軍隊）比路度（聖約瑟）狄臣（海軍隊）梁榮照（南華南）</p>
<p>侯澄滔（東方會）告山　（聖約瑟）李惠堂（南華南）馮景祥（南華南）鄧廣森（南華南）</p>
<p>其所以主選此隊之理由、大約是說香港守門員雖仍有好手如劾利、包家平、及海軍之希瑟等、惟依其觀察、則此二者　不如譚穩健可靠、李大生之當左內衞、懸諸國門而不易、但屈臣不在、則另一人唯雷米迪堪當其選、麥紹漢雖慣與李合作、然無如雷之脚頭、中堅則梁榮照、比路度、狄臣均好、但梁能充右前衛、故主梁居右而以比或狄居中、左前衛則以爲非士地路莫屬、三內鋒之用李、馮、吿、已爲衆口一詞之最上人選、至侯澄滔雖嫌常犯越位例以阻全線進取力、但環觀今之港中左翼、無有疾捷而善盤善射如彼者、羅斗文前雖嘗有絕好演出、但近似退化、故主用侯不用羅、右翼主用鄧廣森、蓋因其近日常有良好演出、且極能與馮景祥合作云、　（飛而生）</p>

<p>娛樂……原野風光</p>
<p>South　Rfdng</p>
<p>年來英國影片已有長足的進步、像元旦在本港放映的「金鼓雷鳴」和本片、便是很好的例證、「原野風光』本是一部文學名著、作者Wfnfred　Holtby是一個極關心社會與政治問題的作家、片中所描寫的、是反映着一個標準的英國鄉村、在那里有着驕頑豪華漸趨沒落的地主、和貧病交集的村民、還有着大量沒機會受教育的孩童、居處在毫無衛生設備汚穢不堪的地方、片中更描寫　一班熟心社會事業的人們、怎樣努力的謀改造　個鄕村、回時揭穿了那些專說漂亮話、而對自己的行爲尙且不能負職的小人之輩自私自利的黑幕、</p>
<p>主要演員像安娜蓓絲，和羅夫李却遜、演出也稱得優秀精鍊、其餘各演員、也各有相當之成就、</p>
<p>皇后……死光爆炸機</p>
<p>Arrest　Bulldog　Diummon</p>
<p>關於特　門偵探的影片、以前已有過好幾部、但每部都有一個獨立的故事、現在在這部「死光爆炸機」中、演員方面，除了以HE華納代替約翰巴里穆亞外、餘的沒多大的變更、在所有的特萊門偵探片中、本片有比較曲折驚險的故事、內容描寫特萊門在臨婚的前夕、又因好友某教授被人家暗殺某教授是一個發明家、正在從事死光爆炸機的發明、持萊鬥爲報友仇心切，且事關國防大事、便努力追緝敵蹤、歷盡危險、卒把奸人一網打盡、</p>
<p>全片情節緊張活潑、約翰霍華而演偵演探、小虎虎有生氣、其餘各演員的演技、也皆各有獨到之處、</p>
<p>平安……小寡婦祕史</p>
<p>That　Certafn　Woman</p>
<p>是貝蒂黛維絲和亨利方達、繼「紅　淚痕」後冉度合作的作品、本片此次公映、在本港已算是第二次了婚</p>
<p>故事叙述一段傷心的、事、貝蒂飾一工作　生的寡婦、同一男子戀愛、但因男子父親劇烈反對的緣故、以致婚事不成、可是不幸巳懷了孕、不久生了一個小孩、後來那男子在巴黎和另一女子結婚、接着那女子傷了脚部變為殘廢、同時因爲同情於丈夫和那　婦所生的小諧、便犧牲割愛，讓他們重孩永好、</p>
<p>全片悲劇氣氛相當濃厚、幾個高潮點、也很有操縱觀衆情緒的力量、貝蒂黛維絲飾演一受社會環境重重壓迫的寡婦、有深刻動人的演出、亨利方達也很稱職、</p>
<p>東方……母子眞情</p>
<p>Of　Huran　Heart</p>
<p>是描寫一個家庭的悲劇、父親是一個　宗教犧牲一切的教士、但他兒子却反對這種工作、以爲做醫生比較牧師來得實際、所以經過一次劇烈的爭辯後、兒子便離家學醫、及後老父病死、母親因犧牲一切爲兒子　教育費、及學成適達內戰爆發、救護工作使他感到很大的興趣、因爲先前感到家庭所留給他的影家不良、就把老母也忘了、直到經人指責，才感愧而重回到母親的懷抱中、</p>
<p>全片悲劇成份非常濃厚、同時此片雖非戰爭片、可　戰爭及救護等塲、也頗有可觀、幾位主要演員、對我們好像生疏一點、但在演出却並不使人失望</p>
<p>大華……賢明法官是</p>
<p>Jndge　Hardy’s　Children</p>
<p>故事的格局、無異「紅顏易老」是寫哈台接政府之電召、回京主持事宜、於是一家便由鄉下遷居到華盛頓、不幸哈台爲友欺弄、而女兒曼麗也差些誤於虛榮、受人之騙、兒子安德烈也關出一樁很詼諧的羅曼史、最後仍囘到故鄕、度着　活、生</p>
<p>導演喬治希滋處理這一平凡的教育故事、且有十分細膩的法手、在畫面上勾劃各個的個性、也很生動、而裏邊有些穿挿及對白、使歡衆特別感到興味、演員方面、最成功的是密蓋朗尼、西雪麗派克也很可愛、其餘幾個配角都稱職、</p>
<p>新世界……女人世界</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>劇情描寫一個女子公寓內、一般女寄宿者的故事在這公寓內、包含着各式各型的人物、她們各有各的職業、但是複雜不堪、這其中有女學生、女記者、女推銷凡、歌、女舞女……等、舉員都市中所有的　業女人、在這裏包括殆盡、羣雌粥粥、她們各有着各的遭遇、說她是都市中女人的一個縮影、也未嘗不可、但是全劇劇情的進浪、因爲無男人之襯托、顯得非常懈而勉强、引不起觀衆的興趣、同時本片也祗能描寫出一般女人的普通私生活、如　粉爭吵、而對於廣遍的女性的描寫、始終沒有寫出、這實在是本片失敗的惟一原因、最後因公寓的被炸、全體女人覺悟過來、聯合起來到前線去、也顯得不自然而且公式化、可是、話雖是這樣說、我們也得原諒編導者、以全體女性來演出一部戯、也是一件很困難的事情，</p>
<p>中央……金葉菊續集</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>看過上集的觀衆、總記得在結局時、金葉菊仍被周志誠偷去一對、現在續集中就從這事講起、到金葉菊歸還爲止、劇情無上集緊張而曲折、演來亦非常鬆懈、但這中間仍有不少地方能博得一部份愚笨觀衆的眼淚、如鄺山笑之被害而入獄、小燕飛之探　等、民間故事一貫的作風、還是不能避免、我們不需要看過、就能猜到該片劇情、果然這理想並不錯誤、曹綺文不適宜演這種影片，佈景攝影在華南尙可以過去、收音却是失敗的、</p>
<p>太平……粵劇</p>

<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>近日來在國際時事中發見兩件頗爲離奇的消息，那就是：</p>
<p>一，德國參謀部人員贊揚蘇聯紅軍的偉力。</p>
<p>二，德國非官方宣傳蘇德關係好轉，反共協定將成廢紙。這是可信不可信呢！</p>
<p>我們的觀察認爲是這樣：</p>
<p>第一，德國始終是忠吿其盟友日本勿將軍力消耗于中國，以削弱反蘇力量，亦所以符合反共協定精神。日本軍部一意孤行，深入我國內地，長期作戰。德國很有可能是借敵警友。</p>
<p>第二，慕尼黑協定之後，蘇聯與東南歐各小國，特別是與波蘭及羅馬尼亞關係益趨緊密，德國很有可能佯作親蘇以進行分裂瓦解的活動。</p>
<p>第三，法蘇互助公約，最近又被提出來說是依然有效，同時，各民治國家政府與人民大衆的反法西斯風潮正在　張，德國很有可能是籍放送這種空氣以和緩反法西斯風潮</p>
<p>第四日德意三侵峪在最近的將來，必將有驚人的舉動，殆已成我為大家共所感　的事實。日本駐歐洲各國使節，最近頻頻在巴黎會議，企圖把反共協定轉變為軍事同盟，則德國此舉，莫不是也有烟幕作用？</p>
<p>第五，是日本軍閥擺佈出來的外交把戯，亦有可能，因為主張走反共路綫，走德意路綫的汪精衛派被淸除出來以後，日本軍閥就說中國政府完全親蘇而反德意了。但是，如今蘇聯也『視德』了，則汪精衛之流的主張，不也是正確的嗎？其實這樣的陰謀，絕不會發生作用。（但防備以反共爲幌子的份子藉此招搖，倒是必要的！）</p>
<p>第六，德國想進攻烏克蘭。蘇聯民氣之　盛，德國是知道的。是則德國此舉，亦有可能是消沉蘇聯民氣的煙幕作用。</p>
<p>以上所說，是關于德國方面的。</p>
<p>至于蘇聯方面，國基堅如磐石，不管東方西方，它都不懼他人之侵略。正如國防人委員長希洛伏洛夫所說；必在他人國土，消滅×人。張鼓峯事件已實證了這話。但它是一貫的採取和平政策，這政策的精神，不管對民治國，對法西斯國都是一樣的要使其消泯戰爭。所以它也和德意日維持邦交，維持商務關係，且曾向日提出訂立互不侵犯條約，然而，以此　說蘇聯政策妥協，說社會主義與納粹主義，法西主義是差不多，那簡直是笑話是荒謬之極，蘇聯是最眞誠擁誕世界和平的國家，又是最眞誠援助被壓迫民族爭取自虫解放的國家，假如納粹德國　有意于改善蘇德邦交，蘇聯當然樂意接受。但　如借此假面具以進行某種陰謀。則蘇聯聰敏幹練的政治家，又絕不會人家的鈎。這一點，恐怕侵入者們本人，比我們還要明白。</p>
<p>西戰突變後，突如其來的出現了蘇德親善的空氣，而希特勒上月三十日在國會所作「决定世界命運」的重大演說，又鮮明的表示了殖民地要求，支持意國未來的侵略行動，及擁護日本侵華之立場，然則『司馬昭之心』，不是『路人皆知』了嗎？</p>

<p>嚴冬的夜裏，天空中沒有一片雲。一輪明月，襯着幾點疏星，孤獨的，淸冷的，把它的光輝撒下來，催眠着一切入了夢鄉。馬路上，屋項上，都染了一層銀白色，夜是非常靜寂。</p>
<p>凜冽的寒風，呼呼地怒吼着，遠處教堂傳來淸越的鐘聲，引起了流浪者的感觸。一羣迷途的羔羊，生命像狂風中的沙粒，像茫茫海面上的浮萍，在風裏，在水裏，永是飄流啊！</p>
<p>異地的路頭，盡是陌生的臉，被炮火打碎了的故鄕，常回憶着變成凄凉的夢！</p>
<p>何處才是流浪者最後的歸宿？</p>
<p>何時才是逃亡生活的盡頭？</p>
<p>傷心的淚，藏在老人的眼眶！</p>
<p>孩子們叫着餓，用小手摩着　的　腸！</p>
<p>在故鄉，那靑綠的郊野，有一條淸幽的河水，潺潺地流着，河畔生着許多織弱的楊柳，隨着淸風飄搖，這一幅天然的圖畫，繫上我難忘的記憶，如今，如今呵！×人的鉄蹄踏碎了碧綠的原野，軍馬的嘶鳴嚇破了萬家安祥的夢，在炮灰的殘餘下，祇留下一片悽愴，一片荒凉。</p>
<p>原野的天，空洞洞地，藏着一羣迷途的羔羊，他們沒有嬌艷的金山毡，鶴絨被，和有彈性的『沙發』床，他們祗有一個『道地』的麻包，一兩張爛新聞紙，在疲乏之神腿迫下睡着了，靑天爲帳，草茅是床，北風的哀鳴算是悽愴的催眠歌吧！每個人幸欣着逃出虎口，却懷疑着明日的生命。</p>
<p>然而，他們所遭遇的，除了揶揄，白眼，冷嘲，熱諷……一串尖刻的針刺外，有誰來同情？見憐？</p>
<p>流亡的生活，異地的風塵，激起心中無限的悲痛。</p>
<p>在萬籟俱寂的深夜，風裏一羣迷途的羔羊覺悟了！他們知道要生存只有鬥爭，于是堅强地尋找着光明的大道前進。</p>

<p>— 晚萸</p>
<p>腥風血雨的時代，是不容許釋迦牟尼來倡行那些使人類可以成佛的說法的，因爲『放下屠刀，立地成佛，』這類腐調巳絕對不適於這個時代。很明顯的，今日的中國，是一切興衰的劃界，也是一切生死的關頭，爲了要爭取全民挨所需要的需要，自然不得不開始着民族鬥爭的大屠殺，我們要從大屠殺中開闢出新生的道路來，中國目前屠殺的對象有二：一是毀減全人類的勁敵，一是鏟除全民族的敗類；而這兩點也可說：前者對內，後者對外。</p>
<p>然而，殺人的工具是些什麼呢？</p>
<p>無疑地，戰士掌中的是刀是槍，是鋼鐵與硫磺；而文人手裏的却唯有長僅寸許的一個筆尖了。</p>
<p>別以爲筆是一種毫無能爲的東西，它祗能寫寫西廂，寫寫紅樓夢，寫寫金瓶梅，寫寫微笑的過，寫寫男三女角式的羅曼史；同樣地，它也可以殺人，歷史上的筆，本來早被運用做了殺人的工具，那時筆的殺人工作也許就稱爲筆誅。不是嗎？『別人懷寶劍，我有筆如刀，』說得多麼響亮而痛快。</p>
<p>可惜歷史上的筆雖能殺人，但所殺的對象不廣也不多；被殺者的罪狀又不分明；甚至錯辨是非，竟有誤殺。此外因爲殺得不得其法，致禾能演個淋漓盡致，大快人心，更是常有的事。這些都是筆的錯誤嗎？自然不是，祇因運用它的人缺少一點觀察，缺少一點按巧罷了。所以，筆雖然可以被當作殺人的利器，問題還在於執筆的人底本領；其情形相似，任何刀槍都能致人死命，而最後的關鍵得照劊子手所採取的殺人的手法。</p>
<p>現在，鮮血染遍了河山，大屠殺早巳開始。或對外，或對內，凡是黃帝的子孫都應該站穩自己的崗位，執行這種神聖的任務。那末站在文化前哨的作者們，更不該忘了以筆代刀的責任了。</p>
<p>瞧：那些沐猴而冠的東西：那些搖頭擺尾的東西；那些扮鬼作怪的東西；以及望去儼然像人而實非人的東西……全得利用鋒利的筆尖，剖開它們的腹，揭穿它們心腸內的秘密，砍下它們的頭，傾出它們腦袋的黑幕。作者們必須絕對的利用了筆，使一切醜妖怪魔見了它就現原形，從此不敢猖獗，讓筆替民族鬥爭的大屠殺上添演一些歷史的功勳，同時讓筆在中國文化的旅程上也培植一點燦爛的點綴！</p>

<p>— 華游</p>
<p>厭聞打敗仗</p>
<p>戰事爆發之後，我們的最　領袖曾經這樣誥誡過國人：</p>
<p>『聞勝勿驕，聞敗勿餒？』這意思無非是教人沉着應戰。</p>
<p>在印度支那某一個省會上，住着這樣的一個老頭子，（越人）他却把它改爲：</p>
<p>『聞勝則喜，敗則勿言』的趣語。</p>
<p>聽說誰到該老頭子家裏向他報吿中國軍事失利的話，會馬上給他滾出去的。他說他雖然不是中國人，他却十分愛中國！他不願聽到他所愛的中國人會打敗仗，這就是「敗則勿言』的意思。</p>
<p>至於其他一般的安南人，他們雖不會像詩老頭子那樣熱愛中國，他們聽到×人慘無人道地殘殺愛好和平的中國人，尤其看到畫報上登着被×人摧殘的建築物及無辜良民支離其身體，橫臥遍地時，他們會嘆息道：文明人的行爲竟是這樣？大有感到：『時日害喪？予及女皆亡！』之慨—關於這，只要看到去年十一月七日河內某法文報載着署名格圓論『中日戰爭與吾人』一文中，他就公開宣陳：『中國對日本厮殺，實爲吾人而戰。」便可以看出他們對這嗜殺戮者，採取什麼一種態度了。</p>
<p>匿名捐欵</p>
<p>當你從西貢坐軍車往堤岸（Celon）時，電車走不上幾秒鐘你向左邊車窗外一望，便可以讓你看見在幾株高聳的椰子樹裏夾着一幅分外奪目的靑天白日滿地紅的旗幟，高高掛在一座洋樓的面前，那就是我們中華民國駐西貢的領事舘。在這幅旗幟之下開啓着的鉄門，每天就有不少露着臉匿了姓名的安南人，帶着東方匯理銀行的紙鈔，向着我們的領館捐進去—他們爲什麼會把那些可貴的金錢，交給我們領館的職員呢？更爲什麼露着臉還要匿了姓名呢？由前一點而言，　當然是他們同情我們的抗戰！尤其抗議×人的强盜行爲！由後而言！他們實在有難言的苦衷！這與我們於捐款時，隨便寫上「無名氏」三個字，意義就大大不同了。</p>
<p>馬路上演武劇</p>
<p>日子與地點是記不淸了，反正這件事是發生在安南某一個商埠上。</p>
<p>那是太陽舉着的脚步，呈着疲倦的姿態向大地上一切揮手作別時，某地的馬路上圍着許多人，像爭看變什麼戯法似的，原來是兩個不識趣的人在那裏演武劇。街警因爲人們的麕集，手持棍棒趕將過來。演武劇的角色，也爲了街警之來而輟演。他們的衣服是扯裂了，臉龐滿印着血紅的傷痕。這樣他們各憑一些記號被帶到警察局去！</p>
<p>『你們爲了什麼事打架？』官問。</p>
<p>『我們爲着辯論中日戰爭。』中國犯人設。</p>
<p>『辯論中日戰爭，爲何至於打架？』官再問。</p>
<p>『他說最後勝利屬於中國，我不服，就和他起衝突！』安南犯人說。</p>
<p>『滾你的，他是中國人，當然希望中國打戰勝仗。最後勝利屬於他們。你不是日本人，爲什麼不服他的說話呢？』官生氣地說，並向那個安南犯人賞了一個耳光！同時還判他監禁三個星期。那位中國人受了愛國的誇獎之後，終於帶着微笑離了警局出來。</p>
<p>輕微的嘆息</p>
<p>在一個午後，我們夫婦陪伴了一位姓譚的廣州朋友，到動物園去遊玩。我們雖身在異國却心在家邦，我們更痛念着前線衡鋒殺×的戰士們，同時更痛恨×人的飛濫機炸我們許多不設防的城市。因之我們談話的資料，是集中在中日戰爭上，雖然我們談的是廣州話，但是坐在前面那個馬車夫（越人）似聽懂了多少一般，轉過頭來對我說：</p>
<p>『日本實在太恃勢了，可惜這次却碰了一鼻子灰！看他再兇多少日子？』</p>
<p>我聽後覺得很奇異，就用安南　向他問道：『你何以見出日本人碰了一鼻子灰呢？』</p>
<p>「日本軍部不是這樣說過嗎？中國事件，只消幾個月就可以解决。現在打了一年多，集了全國的精銳，圍攻了幾個月的漢口，至今還看不出眉目來（按那時漢口仍未放棄）。從這一點就可以看得出日本的疲態來。其次就以安南來講，當中日戰事未發生之前，日本人在這裏，那種氣燄迫人，眞是不可一世！現在呢，却給沙國人看出破綻來了？……」</p>
<p>『看出什麼破綻呢？』我打斷他的說話這樣問着。</p>
<p>『從前日本浪人在這裏常常闖禍，每逢事故發生，殖民地政府多是遷就他們，怕和他們起衝突：現在就大大不同了。他們如做出有碍秩序的事情，殖民地政府就會無所顧忌地把他們驅逐出境。這樣看來，這不是濫用武力所受到的損失嗎？」他說完後，很替那暴發戶行將沉淪下去而嘆惜，我們也不禁爲之輕微地嘆息。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Smashing the × Army's South China Strategy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the × Army of South China, employing a cone-shaped piercing tactic, seized Guangzhou from Daya Bay, it has, for several months, been intensifying the construction of defensive fortifications in the suburbs of Guangzhou on the one hand, attempting to hold key points firmly to prevent a large-scale siege by our army; and on the other hand, it has been stationing troops in Sanshui, preparing to advance up the West River to invade Guangxi. Fortunately, our army quickly adjusted and calmly contained them. The people have risen up, launching strikes against the enemy at any time and any place, having already seized the initiative and stabilized the war situation. However, judging from the recent continuous reinforcement of troops to the West River by the × and the frequent appearances of × warships near Beihai, the intention to seize Guangxi is still unabated. Guangxi is a barrier to the southwestern hinterland and an advanced position for recovering Guangzhou. Its safety and loss have long been the focus of national attention. Therefore, a brief explanation based on publicly available materials is provided below.</p>
<p>The entire province of Guangxi is characterized by winding mountain ranges and rapid currents. Furthermore, the political system is on the right track, and the people have simple and robust customs. The × knows that attempting to lay hands on it will inevitably involve significant sacrifices. However, to cut off our Sino-French international transportation line and threaten the southwestern provinces, there is indeed a need to bet everything on a single throw. Therefore, although the South China × naval and land forces have hesitated to move beyond Sanshui, they are simultaneously spreading smoke screens of plotting against Guangxi, deploying new offensives. The reason for this lies herein. According to general speculation, the reason why the × has been unable to carry out military operations to seize Guangxi is due to the shared hatred of the enemy among the soldiers and civilians in Guangdong, preparing to launch a counteroffensive. The invasion routes to Guangxi are also the most difficult choices for the South China × leadership. In fact, the × can only advance into Guangxi from Guangdong via four routes, and on each route, the × must risk tremendous danger to gain even a small piece of land:</p>
<p>(1) Advance up the West River from Sanshui to attack Cangwu. This route is the shortest route to invade Guangxi because shallow-water warships can navigate the West River below Cangwu year-round, and the × naval and land forces can launch a joint offensive. However, at present, in addition to stationing heavy troops to guard key areas in the lower reaches of the West River to block the enemy's land invasion, our army has strictly blockaded the West River waterway above Zhaoqing, prohibiting passage. (Taking the Chicken Cage Island blockade line downstream of Cangwu as an example, the depth reaches ten miles.)</p>
<p>(2) Use the navy to take the route through the Gulf of Tonkin, land in Beihai, and proceed through Lianzhou (Hepu), Qinzhou, and Xixiang to Yongning (Nanning) and Longjin (Longzhou), cutting off the Sino-Vietnamese transportation line, obstructing our international transportation, and then follow the extension line of the Xiang-Gui Railway, go north to Liuzhou, and strike at the back of Guilin. This route has attracted the most attention from the general public. However, according to those familiar with the situation, Beihai has a lot of sand and shallow water, making it extremely difficult for enemy large ships to approach the shore, and landing troops is particularly difficult. Even if the × successfully lands, the "Shiwandashan" (Ten Thousand Great Mountains) obstructs them west of Lianzhou and Qinzhou, making it impossible for enemy mechanized units to fly over. We have built national defense works in this area and dispatched elite ××× divisions and ××× divisions to closely monitor it, making it difficult for the enemy to succeed.</p>
<p>(3) Use the navy to land near Guangzhou Bay (or Beihai), follow the highway north to attack Yulin, and then pass through Rongxian to attack the rear of Cangwu. In addition to stationing heavy troops to guard this area, we have completely destroyed all highways south of Yulin. (In the past, those going to Hong Kong and Shanghai from Guangxi mostly passed through Guangzhou Bay. Since the destruction of the highways, they now have to change their route and go through Yongning and Longjin out of Zhennanguan, and then go to Hong Kong and Shanghai via Hanoi.) Moreover, due to the natural barrier of the Goulou Mountains, even if they land, it will be difficult to penetrate deeply.</p>
<p>(4) Use the army to go northwest from Sanshui, along the Suijiang River through Sihui and Guangning, and enter the Guangxi territory at Huaiji, then turn to Kaijian to flank Cangwu. This route was the route taken by Yue Fei of the Southern Song Dynasty to suppress Cao Cheng. It is located in the border area of the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan. If it goes out to the northwest, it will also threaten Guilin and Hengyang. However, because the highways have been completely destroyed and there is the complicated Kuai Zhu Ridge, it is difficult for the modernized × army to seek development.</p>
<p>According to the estimates of some strategists, most people believe that the × will send their main force to Beihai and launch a supporting attack on the West River. However, the × strategy may be the opposite. After all, the West River is a shortcut, and the difference in difficulty compared with landing in Beihai is vast. At present, the highways in the Guangdong war zone and the quasi-war zone are being actively destroyed, but unfortunately, they are often not thorough enough. The highways in Guangxi province near the quasi-war zone have been completely destroyed. In many places, reservoirs have been created by blocking mountains and rivers, or they have been cultivated into farmland, and even the traces of the highways have disappeared. Therefore, it is almost a dream for the × to enter Guangxi using highways.</p>
<p>Geographical conditions are sufficient to hinder the × from entering Guangxi, and the spirit of building spiritual fortresses among the people of Guangxi is even stronger. Guangxi's conscription performance has always been excellent. Although there was a phenomenon of evading military service in the second half of last year, the provincial government authorities remedied it early, and normalcy has long been restored. Furthermore, in preparation for a long-term total war, the young adults in the province are undergoing guerrilla warfare training. They are also using existing civilian firearms to cultivate self-defense forces. According to recent statistics, the province's districts, counties, townships, and villages have more than one million directly administered young adult guerrilla team members (from eighteen to forty-five years old), with approximately three to four hundred thousand firearms. In addition to practicing guerrilla warfare on the spot, they are also engaged in guide, detective, disciplinarian, traitor extermination, transportation (manpower, animal power, and material resources), rescue, reception, laundry, sewing, stretcher bearing, and burial duties. Therefore, if the × are fortunate enough to cross into Guangxi province, in addition to facing the attacks of our regular army on the front, these more than one million long-trained guerrilla team members will inevitably impede them everywhere, causing them to have uneasy sleep and meals, making it difficult to advance or retreat, and ultimately leading to their destruction.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many uncivilized ethnic minorities in Guangxi, such as the Miao and Yao. The authorities have attached great importance to this early on, in light of the lessons of the Miao rebellions in the Song and Ming dynasties. Therefore, since the 23rd year of the Republic of China, they have established special teacher training institutes, recruiting young people from the Miao and Yao ethnic groups to enter the institutes for training, so as to make them the main force for developing ethnic minorities. They also regularly dispatch political workers to work in the mountainous areas of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups, and the results are quite considerable. Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, although these ethnic minorities have not yet participated in combat, most of the young adults of various ethnic groups have been trained by military instructors dispatched by the authorities to the area. At present, there are more than × thousand Miao and Yao ethnic group young adults who can be assembled on the spot at any time to strike the enemy. This news should be welcomed by those who are concerned about the problems of ethnic minorities in the southwest.</p>

<h3 id="e2">On the Supreme National Defense Council <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Ge</p>
<p>Adapting to the new needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council is the most significant achievement of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and it is also the most significant achievement of the Chinese nation in the year and a half of heroic resistance under the call, influence, and direct leadership of the revolutionary party. It will have a very significant and positive impact on the future of the Chinese national liberation movement and the future of the Eastern national revolutionary movement, making people feel infinite excitement and infinite expectation.</p>
<p>Based on news from various relevant parties in China and abroad, the Supreme National Defense Council, established by the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, has particularly significant nature and meaning. First, the Supreme National Defense Council is the highest organ for managing the military and political affairs of the country and leading the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, outside the Central Executive Committee. The National Government serves as its political executive organ, the Military Affairs Commission serves as its military executive organ, and the Central Party Headquarters serves as its party affairs executive organ. All important military, political, party, and mass movements related to the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction can be decided and implemented by the meeting, with the aim of coordinating all activities of resistance, increasing the nation's human and material resources, and striving for final victory. Looking back at the facts of the year and a half of the War of Resistance, although there has been progress in all aspects, the serious existence of shortcomings and obstacles in all aspects is also an undeniable fact. In particular, the failure to properly and effectively adjust the party, government, and mass movement organizations at all levels, and the failure to perfectly concentrate and uniformly distribute the nation's human and material resources. Now that the Supreme National Defense Council has been established, it will fully accept the past experience and lessons, and further promote the progress of military, political, party, and mass movements in order to complete the great cause of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Second, the Supreme National Defense Council, established by the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, is the product of the consolidation and expansion of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, and it is a national alliance that adapts to the new stage of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. At the same time, it is also the supreme command that fairly represents public opinion. The members of the council include party, government, military, and cultural leaders, and leaders of various parties and factions other than Kuomintang members are also invited to participate. For example, Communist leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De, although not participating in the organization, have also been invited. It can truly be praised as "creating a new era in the political history of our country." Since the War of Resistance, the National United Front has become increasingly consolidated, and popular organs such as the National Political Council have begun to show their strength, but its consolidation and its strength are still far from sufficient. On the contrary, the divisive conspiracies of the × people, traitors, and pro-Japanese elements, and defeatists are rampant. The declaration of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China last October sincerely supported the National Government and supported Chairman Chiang, and proposed specific measures to strengthen national unity, strengthen KMT-CPC cooperation, consolidate the United Front, and establish a national alliance, the main intention of which was to overcome the × people's conspiracies of division and destruction, and strive for final victory. Now that the Supreme National Defense Council has been established, actually carrying out the task of its national alliance and even the supreme organ of national defense, not only will KMT-CPC cooperation and national unity be better guaranteed in the future, making all × people, traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and defeatists lose the opportunity to sow discord, spread rumors, and undermine, but also the mutual relations between the government and the people, the central and local governments, and various departments of military, political, party, and mass movements will be closer, and the government's prestige among the people and internationally will be enhanced. In the history of the Eastern national revolution, it has truly opened the most glorious page.</p>
<p>However, we must recognize that the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council, on the one hand, is the "crystallization" of the past year and a half of heroic War of Resistance's experience and lessons, and on the other hand, it is only the establishment of a foundation for striving for victory in the second stage of the War of Resistance. How to stop the × people's offensive, develop rear area construction, advance our army's counteroffensive, and strive for final victory in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction will depend on more heroic, more serious, and more appropriate struggles. Especially in this period of transition from the first stage of the War of Resistance to the second stage, in this "building up a mountain nine cubits high," the turning point of victory or defeat, the × people's final, most fierce, and most cruel offensive is just beginning, and the conspiracies of the × people, traitors, and lurking pro-Japanese elements and defeatists, who advocate "anti-communism," "peace," "establishing a peace and national salvation army," and "establishing a central government," are also just beginning. We must particularly recognize the difficulties and dangers of the current situation. In particular, the Supreme National Defense Council must urgently implement a revolutionary new strategy in the military, stop the × people's offensive, and develop preparations for a counteroffensive; in politics, thoroughly improve political institutions at all levels and realize democratic politics and the improvement of people's livelihoods during the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction; in the economy, fully implement the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction program and the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session; and in diplomacy and education, use all efforts for the central task of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression War of Resistance. In addition, we must also pay attention to: (1) developing the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and all anti-Japanese parties, and concentrating all forces under the leadership of the Supreme National Defense Council to support the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction; (2) rigorously carrying out the anti-traitor movement, thoroughly eliminating traitors, spies, pro-Japanese elements, and defeatists, and all traitorous puppet organizations, and also thoroughly sweeping away the propositions that use the name of "peace and national salvation" and "anti-communism and national salvation" to divide and undermine our unity in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council will undoubtedly give the Japanese fascist aggressors a fatal blow, and will become a great guarantee of the liberation of the Chinese nation and the safety of the Far East and world peace. Every Chinese son and daughter who does not want to be a slave of a fallen country and every international person who advocates justice and peace and demands freedom will rejoice, praise, and be inspired by the emergence of this great force. We must respond to this progress of our government with greater enthusiasm in contributing wealth, labor, and knowledge, and support the Supreme National Defense Council in smoothly carrying out its great and glorious task of liberating the Chinese people and striving for human happiness!</p>
<h3 id="e3">Heshan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>The Vanguard of the West River Southern Route</p>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Heshan, this is the vanguard of the West River Southern Route in Guangdong. It is located in the lower reaches of the West River, grasping the key to traffic up and down the West River. In peacetime, it is only a third-class county, but since the invaders' × hooves stepped into the southern coast of our motherland, after the loss of most of the south, its position has become increasingly important with the shifting of the war. If the × wants to invade from the West River, then Heshan is also a necessary route. Therefore, in order to protect the various places on the West River Southern Route, it is necessary to defend Heshan firmly. If Heshan—the vanguard of the West River Southern Route—can always defend firmly, then the invaders' attempt to trample the various places on the West River Southern Route will undoubtedly turn into a dream.</p>
<p>From Guangning, the mountainous area on the border of western Guangdong, the guerrilla capital, we walked countless rugged mountain roads and those destroyed highways. After four days of long-distance walking, we arrived at Heshan, the vanguard of the West River Southern Route. It was four o'clock in the afternoon on January 13th. We, with a pair of tired feet and a tired body, ran into Shaping, the chief town of Heshan County. Here, the distance from the Haikou, where the × and our armies are confronting each other, is only about ten miles. The sound of cannons fired across the river is often so heavy and clear. Heshan, it is now like a brave warrior who has been in battle for a long time, standing firmly and calmly on the front line of the West River Southern Route. The sound of cannons, machine guns, and the bombing of airplanes cannot make it appear flustered and frightened. When our footsteps first stepped into Shaping, its scene was greatly beyond our expectations. Who would have known that this city and town, which is so close to the front line, could still maintain such calmness and such prosperity?</p>
<p>From Guangning to Heshan</p>
<p>From Guangning, a mountainous area, the guerrilla capital, we walked through two days of mountain roads, emerged from the mountains in the northwest, bid farewell to the lonely ancient city lying on the hillside, and walked down the vast Gaoyao plain. In Lubu in Gaoyao County, we took a ferry eastward, arriving at Zhaoqing, an important town in the middle of the West River, that night. The next morning, we crossed the river from Zhaoqing again, and walked along the Yaoming Highway, which had been destroyed, to Baitou. At Baitou, we turned onto a small mountain path, arriving at Gaoming City in the evening. Although Ming City is still far from the front line, it has become very lonely due to the bombing of airplanes and the threat of gunpowder gas. We stayed here for one night, and the next day we hoped to jump to Shaping.</p>
<p>After eating breakfast at six o'clock, we began to move the exhaustion that had not yet been restored to the new journey. This section of the road from the mountain city to Yangmei in Heshan is another small mountain path. Fortunately, there are still many pedestrians on this small road. On the one hand, there are travelers coming from Heshan, preparing to pass through Ming City and enter the interior; on the other hand, there are travelers coming out from the interior, preparing to pass through Heshan and transfer to overseas. On the other hand, there are also coolies and women who transport fruits, incense powder, bamboo strips, and other local products from the interior to Jiangdou in Heshan, because this is a key route for transportation between the interior and overseas, so there are an unusually large number of people coming and going. A mountain road that winds for more than 40 miles is constantly crowded with travelers and coolies. It is indeed quite lively.</p>
<p>At the junction of Gaoming and Heshan, there is a small market town. This is Yangmei (not Yangmei in Sanshui). In the past, Yangmei was just a small and not very prosperous market town, but since the destruction of the Heshan-Gaoming Highway, this place has become the most convenient for transportation between Heshan and Gaoming. The number of people walking this road has gradually increased, so it has also prospered accordingly. When people run out of the winding mountain path and walk over that small hillside, what first catches their eyes is a large group of coolies and sedan chair carriers gathered in front of the market, like a group of ants swarming together. It is truly a spectacular sight. Sedan chairs—those simple ones with only two bamboo poles, a seat board, and a footrest pole—are placed on the ground in rows. It seems that there are at least one or two hundred of them. The scene is really lively beyond precedent. As for the crowd inside the market, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>From Yangmei to Shaping, there are another 40-odd miles of mountain paths. I don't know why, but after passing Yangmei, the number of pedestrians on the mountain paths decreased. The deeper you go, the fewer people there are, until you come out of Longkou, where the number of people increases again. This is no longer walking on a mountain path, but on a destroyed highway. Walking along the Shajin—Shaping to Jinshu—Highway for more than ten miles, you step into Shaping.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Shaping</p>
<p>Today's Shaping is not only a commercial center, but also a military stronghold. It is only about ten miles away from the Haikou, where the × and our armies are confronting each other, and it is also no more than ten miles away from Gulao, which has been burned down by the ×. When the news of the fall of Guangzhou reached here, and the sound of cannons from Jiujiang being trampled by the × came, it did indeed have a chaotic and panic-stricken situation, but soon it became quiet and strong again.</p>
<p>Although the Shaping Railway Station has been bombed many times by the big-brand iron birds, it is still stubbornly alive. We rested our feet in a hotel next to the station, and then went to the streets to inspect it again. In the past, the Chongde Sandfield area of Shaping was a very prosperous place, but since the Chongde Road area was bombed, it has become deserted. Now there are only a few loads of vegetables that are difficult to place there, and there are not many pedestrians. Although the shops are still open, there are very few customers. The prosperous scene of shoulder-to-shoulder crowds in the past has been relegated to the city center, where pedestrians and vendors are extremely crowded. As for Bank Road, it was originally the financial center of Heshan. Usually, all the banking, remittance, and banking companies are located here. The road is very tidy and clean. Since the bombing, the situation has been very different from the past. Most of those silver houses and money shops are closed, but the other industries are mostly the same as in the past.</p>
<p>The food shops, teahouses, and restaurants in Shaping are doing very well, because there are many people passing through, so they earn a lot of money. There is also an ice room here, with various drinks such as milk and coffee, and Western pastries for customers. This is indeed something that is not available all the way from Guangning to Heshan. In addition to the ice room, there is also a women's barbershop here. Although the hairdressers are in the midst of × soldiers close by and continuous artillery fire, they can still put on heavy makeup, wear light clothes and curved hair, and smile and wink to deal with customers. Their customers are mostly lonely travelers. They talk and laugh with each other. In one room, there is a peaceful atmosphere, making people forget the beacon fire in front of them.</p>
<p>The people living in Shaping don't seem to feel anything about the cannons they hear every day. They are still doing their business, and the idlers who are watching the tricks in front of the Jianghu people selling plaster stalls don't seem to be nervous, but they are calm.</p>
<p>From Shaping to Weidun</p>
<p>At the North Street entrance of Shaping, we took a small awning boat to Weidun. This is a very small and narrow river. Along this small river, one end can lead to Haikou Gubou, and the other end can lead to Shengping Paigu Lao. The general name for Shengping Town and Gulao is Weidun. It includes several market towns and many villages, because it is surrounded by a dike, and there are ponds and rivers crisscrossing inside.</p>
<p>The small boat is in Shengping Town (the local name is Daokou Market, which sounds like Dakou Market in Guangzhou dialect). The market has only one street, which is very small, but since Gulao was attacked by the ×, all the businesses in Gulao have moved to Shengping Town. So when we landed, even though it was almost sight, there were still so many people on the streets. The cement street was so wet and dirty that walking on it made your feet feel floating and slippery, almost falling. There are no guesthouse facilities here, so we had to walk those winding mulberry paths for several miles to live in the countryside.</p>
<p>This village is called Jiurenhe. Most of the residents here are surnamed Ma and Li. Since the × army invaded Gulao, most of them have never left their village. They have become accustomed to the machine guns and cannons that the × people sweep over from Heqing and Shakou every day, and the airplanes that fly over the Weidun area to scout and drop bombs. Their fishing is still fishing, and their shrimp catching is still catching shrimp. All of their lives are no different from usual, even though this place is about to become the front line.</p>
<p>The next morning, amidst the symphony of cannon fire, machine gun fire, airplane sounds, and bomb sounds, we ran from Jiurenhe to Shengping Town. The residents of the town did not feel anything at all. They were still doing business. At a congee shop at the end of the market, we ate a bowl of fish and meat congee. We asked the old woman who sold the congee if these gunshots and cannon fire were there every day. She replied that they used to be there every day, but they had been silent for a week, and only since yesterday had there been such gunshots and cannon fire again. At the end, she said:</p>
<p>"What are we afraid of! They can't come over!"</p>
<p>After eating the congee, we continued along the dike to Shuangqiao Market. The further we went, the louder the sound of gunfire became. After walking for twenty minutes, we arrived at Shuangqiao Market. Shuangqiao Market is very close to Gulao. The shells fired by the × army in Heqing had hit near it. On the way to Shuangqiao Market, a large banyan tree on the dike was blasted off one side, and several houses were collapsed by another shell. But one thing is that Shuangqiao Market, which is within the range of the × people's shells, is still as prosperous as Shengping Town. The people who were going to the market were still as crowded and coming and going. Despite the sound of gunfire, machine gun fire, airplane sounds, and bomb sounds that were ringing in their ears, people were still trading and living, and the state of peace was unbelievable.</p>
<p>We stayed in Shuangqiao Market for less than a few minutes, and then hurried back to Shengping Town to call the small boat to row back to Shaping. On the way, the constant sound of bombs and cannons was still ringing loudly.</p>
<p>When we returned to Shaping, it was already twelve o'clock at noon. We quickly ran to Yugang, took the only remaining small section of the Jiang-Fo Highway to Shuanglong, and walked to Jiangmen again. It was dusk again. (Morning of January 25, 1939.)</p>

<p>(Our Chongqing Dispatch, 1st) The Fifth Plenary Session has concluded. It is reported that new military deployments have been made, and the war situation will soon see new developments. According to reports, puppet troops in various occupied areas of the north have been extensively mobilized in recent days, mostly for troop rotations and a show of force. However, fighting continues in northeastern Shandong and at the borders of Hebei and Chahar. The puppet troops in Shanxi are increasing their forces southwestward, with fierce fighting continuing in Jie County, Yincheng, and Yu Township. There is contact between Linjin and Ronghe. Our troops are firmly defending strongholds in the Zhongtiao Mountains, and we once attacked the Shuitou Station.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 1st] The enemy along the Tongpu Railway has been extremely vigilant recently, especially at night, with increased troops lying in ambush on both sides of the tracks to prevent our sabotage of the rails. They are also constantly moving their forces to avoid our attacks after our army destroyed railways and launched continuous assaults. Our army's power in Shanxi has made the enemy restless.</p>
<p>Tension in Shanxi Battlefield</p>
<p>[Minko News Agency, Xingji, 1st] The enemy in Heshun has gradually increased to a brigade in strength. On the 27th, they attacked south in two routes. One route engaged in fierce fighting with our troops at Futou Town (15 li north of Liaoxian) all day, with heavy casualties on both sides. They are still in a stalemate. The other route fought with our troops at Jishan Zhongzhai south of Guai'er Town (northeast of Liaoxian). In addition, 400 enemy troops are gathered at the Han Nen Temple west of Heshun but have not yet moved. On the 25th, our troops attacked Congshan Village (south of Yuncheng), engaging in fierce fighting with the defending enemy for about four hours, killing many enemy troops. In the evening, a unit of our forces attacked Zhang Village, rushing into the village at 4 a.m. on the 26th and engaging in fierce street fighting with the enemy. At dawn, enemy reinforcements from Yuncheng arrived, and our troops withdrew calmly. On the same day, there was fierce fighting between the enemy and our troops in the Zhangjiashan area west of Qianli Ridge. They are currently engaged in combat around Jiuer Valley and Wulao Peak. They fled towards Zengcheng via Hanjia Village after wiping out approximately 800 to 900 enemy troops. A unit of our forces is still in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Minko News Agency, Xingji, 1st] There are currently 200 to 300 enemy troops inside Hejin City and 300 enemy troops in the Fancun Guzhen area. Fearing our attacks, they light fires in the outer villages at night for警戒 until dawn, when they return. Enemy troops in Jishan have increased in recent days but have not yet attacked. It is also reported that Yishi County has been recovered by a unit of our forces. The enemy in Jiaocheng has increased to over 1,000 cavalry and 300 infantry, with 52 artillery pieces. On the morning of the 26th, they divided into three routes to attempt to ambush us to the west and are currently engaged in combat with our troops in the Fanjiashan Qulicun and Lujiashan areas.</p>
<p>Surrender of Puppet Army Commander</p>
<p>[Minko News Agency, Xingji, 1st] Over 500 enemy cavalry troops who attacked westward from Huoxian, fled to Bailong Village (west bank of the Fen River) and still seem to be trying to attack westward. Enemy planes have been frequently flying near Fenxi County for reconnaissance in recent days. The enemy troops in Shangxia Leping Village and Dazhang Village east of Huoxian were attacked by a unit of our forces the night before last. At approximately 2 a.m., our forces rushed to the outskirts of Dazhang Village. The enemy resisted stubbornly from their defensive positions, and fierce fighting continued until dawn, resulting in the death of over 40 enemy troops, with only a few casualties on our side. Furthermore, most of the enemy troops in Dui Jiugu and Hujia Yao areas have retreated, and units of our forces are now approaching the vicinity of Dui Town. The commander of the enemy警備隊, feeling defeated and in a desperate situation, has surrendered to a division of our forces. The enemy who attacked our Huanglong Ridge, Majia Ridge, and Taohua Cha areas were routed by a fierce assault by our troops. The remaining enemy troops fled in all directions towards Jie County, with a portion fleeing west to the areas of Shigou Village, Miaoqian Village, and Hanjia Village. We have recovered Majia Ridge, Moao, and other places, and a unit is still pursuing the remaining enemy troops westward.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Tianjin report: The enemy's attempts to lure Wu Peifu into serving in a puppet position have been intense.

They scheduled a meeting between Wu and over 130 Chinese and foreign journalists on the 30th. Beforehand, the enemy's special service agency prepared a draft of the remarks to be delivered on the spot. Unexpectedly, the content of Wu's remarks during the meeting was completely contrary to the enemy's prepared draft. Wu not only did not express his intention to accept the position but also put forward three conditions, stating that peace could not be achieved unless these conditions were met. The foreign journalists were shocked, and even the enemy supervisors were dismayed. They ordered the censorship agency to withhold foreign journalists' telegrams and, at the same time, had the enemy's prepared remarks sent out by the Domei News Agency in an attempt to cover up the situation. Wu's attitude was very firm, and he disregarded any threats or inducements. The people of Beiping and Tianjin were greatly relieved to hear this.</p>

<p>—Notes from Our Reporter—</p>
<p>——Yesterday at the Hong Kong YWCA——</p>
<p>It is very necessary to study the problem of "The Current Situation of the War of Resistance" at this time. Because since the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the short two or three months have been filled with rapid and progressive changes.</p>
<p>The military conference held in Hengshan on November 25 last year divided the period after the retreat from Wuhan as the first phase of the War of Resistance, and the period after the retreat as the second phase. There are obvious differences in the current situation between the first and second phases.</p>
<p>The Hengshan Conference made important decisions on the military, economic, political... and other departments of the second phase of the War of Resistance, and the Fifth Plenary Session recently conducted concrete discussions and final decisions.</p>
<p>Now, I will report to you the new current situation of the second phase of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Military Aspect: It can be divided into four points:</p>
<p>First, Strategic Aspect</p>
<p>In the first phase of the War of Resistance, we were in a passive position to respond to the war: retreating from Shanghai to Nanjing, from Nanjing to Xuzhou, from Xuzhou to Wuhan. Although we also fulfilled the task of消耗 the enemy, we were still unable to achieve the initiative to annihilate the enemy. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said at the Hengshan Conference that guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare in the future, allocating one-third of our total military force to the front line to fight the enemy, one-third of the military force to consolidate our rear, and one-third of the military force to attack the enemy's rear, so that the enemy is surrounded by us from all directions. Not only can the enemy not achieve their dream of a quick victory, but they simply do not have the military force to allocate to the vast battlefield. From a new strategic perspective, we have the confidence of victory.</p>
<p>Second, Terrain Aspect</p>
<p>The terrain of the second phase of the War of Resistance extends deep into the highlands and mountains of the southwest and northwest. The enemy's navy cannot exert its power, and the use of the air force is also difficult. The mechanized units of the army will also encounter geographical obstacles everywhere. Therefore, this terrain is the most unfavorable for the enemy and the most favorable for our army. After we induce the enemy to go deep, we will eventually annihilate the main force of the enemy. Therefore, from the perspective of terrain, we also have the confidence of victory.</p>
<p>Third, Human Resources Aspect</p>
<p>We are actively mobilizing the strength of the whole people to participate in the War of Resistance. In fact, our national morale and fighting spirit are also getting stronger and stronger. The decision to place politics above military affairs is also a rapid progressive phenomenon after the Hengshan Conference. On the other hand, the number of enemy soldiers invading China is over one million, exceeding the original plan by many times. Japan's strength is limited, and it is impossible to increase its troops any further. Therefore, in terms of human resources, we are superior to the enemy, and we have the confidence of victory.</p>
<p>Fourth, Weapons Aspect</p>
<p>Some people think that the enemy's weapons are better than ours. In fact, this was the case in the first phase of the War of Resistance, but the second phase is different. The enemy's navy, army, and air force have lost their effectiveness, as mentioned above. As for China, the air force in the southwest and northwest is improving quickly. Over the past year or so, our air force has made rapid progress.</p>
<p>In the future, the main determinant of victory or defeat will be the army. Our mechanized elite units will be at least 20 divisions or more, which is several times more than the enemy. Most of these elite units are prepared to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop during the general counter-offensive. This is a solid fact.</p>
<p>Looking at the three months since the fall of Guangzhou, the enemy's progress has been very little. This is not because the enemy has stopped attacking, but because its strength has been exhausted and it has fallen into the quagmire of suffering. Although it sometimes relies on the strength of its navy and has the appearance of being eager to try in places such as Beihai, the West River, and the Yangtze River, it is only limited to harassment and has no great strength to attack.</p>
<p>Under such difficult circumstances, the enemy naturally hopes to end the war as soon as possible. Therefore, there was the 近衛均 peace declaration in December last year, and the conditions it proposed were not as harsh as before. This shows how trapped the enemy is.</p>
<p>But are we going to fall into the enemy's trap and talk peace with them? Only traitors and ignorant people have such dreams. In the first phase of the War of Resistance, we were able to endure bitterly for eighteen months under many unfavorable circumstances. Now we are in an absolutely favorable situation, and the enemy is at the end of its rope. To talk about peace and surrender at this time, only traitors are willing to sell out the interests of the entire good race. (The audience clapped enthusiastically)</p>
<p>Therefore, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, in terms of military affairs, whether it is strategy, terrain, human resources, or weapons, we are superior to the enemy, and we absolutely have the confidence of victory.</p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at the political phenomenon of the second phase of the War of Resistance, which is even more optimistic.</p>
<p>(Due to space limitations, the second half of the political aspect will continue to be published tomorrow.) —Zhuoqi—</p>
<h3 id="e25">Customs Officials Enthusiastically Patriotic; Integrity of Customs Sovereignty; Retired Customs Officials Cannot Bear to Receive Foreign Exchange Profits; Import and Export Customs Forms Have Not Been Revised to Use Japanese <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the customs offices in the north and south have been in special circumstances due to the changes in the Chinese side's positions. The government is very concerned about the sovereignty and administration of the customs offices and is planning to improve them. The following is a summary of the various situations:</p>
<p>Sovereignty and Administration Still Intact</p>
<p>Robert Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, handles all customs administration in accordance with the orders of the central government. Therefore, although the various customs offices are in special circumstances, the sovereignty and administration are still intact. Previously, some customs officials, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, requested the Military Affairs Commission to rectify the discipline of the various customs offices and strive for economy. The Military Affairs Commission approved it and handed it over to the Ministry of Finance for verification. The customs authorities also believed that in the face of national crisis, civil servants should strive to be motivated and save the country through economy. They immediately instructed their subordinates to strictly comply.</p>
<p>Pensions Changed to Foreign Exchange Purchases</p>
<p>Customs officials have a system of monthly savings for pensions, which are paid out upon retirement. This amount is considerable. Since the sudden outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the customs offices have changed the customs officials' monthly pension savings from bonds to foreign exchange. Over the past year, due to the rise in foreign exchange, all retiring customs officials who are entitled to receive their pensions have received almost twice as much as before the war due to the increase in prices after purchasing foreign exchange. However, this type of profit on foreign exchange is purely wartime profit. The retiring customs officials believe that this profit is indirectly increasing the country's foreign exchange expenditure. Many have petitioned the central government, stating that since they are public servants of the country and the war is ongoing, and most civil servants in the provinces are paid with reduced salaries, why should retiring customs officials be exempt from receiving this foreign exchange profit? It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is investigating the situation regarding the opinions of retiring customs officials and will make a decision on how to handle it.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Exaggerated Reporting of Housing Allowances</p>
<p>Customs officials receive housing allowances and other benefits in addition to their monthly salaries. The regulations have always been very strict. Higher-ranking officials receive approximately 50 yuan per month, but it is based on actual expenses, with 50 yuan as the limit. Not long ago, a customs official who lived in a house with a rent of over ten yuan reported 50 yuan. When the Inspector General of Customs found out about it, he ordered his dismissal for exaggerating the report and issued a notice to all customs offices to strictly investigate whether the customs officials' housing allowances were accurate. If there is any exaggeration, they will be immediately punished.</p>
<p>Significant Increase in Japanese Customs Officials</p>
<p>The Shanghai Customs revenue has not been remitted to the central government since July last year. Inspector General of Customs Robert Maze reported this situation to the Ministry of Finance. As for the recent administrative situation of the customs office, there has been a significant increase in the number of Japanese foreign staff. The reason for this is mostly due to the current urgent situation. It is generally believed that this is a temporary special situation and that things will return to normal after some time. As for import and export customs forms, Japanese merchants have recently requested the addition of Japanese. However, the customs authorities have not considered this request because the usual forms are in Chinese and English.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Japan's Serious Crisis: Financial Situation Nearing Collapse, Hyperinflation, People's Livelihoods Suffering, Production Declining Daily, Foreign Relations Worsening <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 31st] News from New York indicates that Japan's financial difficulties have reached the brink of hyperinflation. This is further substantiated by its new budget reaching a staggering 10 billion yen. The amount of paper money issued by the country in 1923 was 1 billion yen, and recently it has increased to 2 billion yen, while industry and commerce have declined. Military industries have developed abnormally, which is detrimental and harmful to ordinary industry and commerce. Its production is decreasing daily, and the price index is increasing daily. According to statistics released by the Bank of Japan, the retail price index, assuming 1914 as 100, was 194 in August 1937, which increased to 303 in the same month last year. The standard of living in 1937 was 194, which increased to 211 last year. The severity of the crisis is self-evident. Moreover, the new massive budget is bound to exacerbate this crisis. Based on this, the industry and commerce in the areas occupied by Japan in China will inevitably be depressed, and improvement will be even more unattainable. Disputes between Japan and various countries will also become increasingly serious. This can be asserted with certainty.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Diet General Meeting Questions War Policy: Attitude towards Britain and the United States Becomes Weaker <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] Tokyo dispatch, 31st. The Diet General Meeting's questioning of war policy was quite sharp. First, Erbei, formerly of the Oriental Association and now affiliated with the Minsei Party, asked whether China's friendliness towards Britain and the United States was due to defects in Japan's diplomatic measures. Arita found this difficult to answer. Erbei asked, "Does the cabinet mean that it has no intention of adopting decisive measures towards British and American policies?" Arita replied, "The Konoe statement has already indicated the target, and now is not the time to adopt decisive measures." Kudo, a member of the Seiyukai, asked, "What is the meaning of the Konoe statement not demanding compensation?" Arita replied, "Private losses cannot be ignored." From this exchange, it can be seen that the Konoe statement of not seeking reparations was actually deceptive. Subsequently, Puyama, a member of the Minsei Party, raised questions about the relationship between Japan and the National Government, but the questions and answers on both sides were rehashes of old topics, with no meaning.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Japan Unable to Sustain War: Considers Convening International Conference <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Oyama further raised an important question, saying that Japan, in order to make various countries understand the truth, should convene an international conference in Tokyo, inviting Britain and the United States, and if necessary, Germany and Italy, to jointly discuss the East Asian issue. This proposal has deep meaning, seemingly intending to use the international conference to seek an end to the Sino-Japanese War. Hiranuma replied that there was a need to explain Japan's true intentions, but there were no plans to convene an international conference at this time. Arita also replied that it was doubtful whether convening such an international conference could make third countries understand, and that it would be more effective to have candid talks with the representatives of the countries concerned stationed in Japan. Oyama also asked whether the current cabinet was considering the four principles for resolving the incident that Japan had proposed to China last year through the German ambassador to China. Arita replied that the current cabinet would continue to implement the Konoe cabinet's policy towards China. The debate then ended. This was one of the most exciting scenes of the 31st, and the domestic anxiety about the international situation and the unease caused by the prolonged war were clearly visible.</p>

<h3 id="e29">British Parliament Reconvenes: Chamberlain Describes Trip, States Close Cooperation between Britain and France <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[London, Central News Agency, 1st] The House of Commons, which had been adjourned for the Christmas holiday, reconvened yesterday afternoon. When Prime Minister Chamberlain answered questions from members on the European situation, he said, "There are no new developments to report at this time." There was a thunderous applause throughout the chamber.</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] Sir Archibald Sinclair, a Liberal member, continued the debate on the government's foreign policy last night, saying that although there was no definite reason for the failure of the government's policy, it could not be trusted in some respects. He said, "We are now expanding our armaments, but we have lost the assistance of some strong armies abroad. A few months ago, we could still rely on the assistance of these armies to resist aggression. At present, we can see geographically that the Rome-Berlin axis crosses Europe, effectively separating Eastern and Western Europe. Britain must show that it is working for freedom and international integrity, which is not shameful or terrible. We want to help the people of Germany, Italy and other countries to build a just and fair world order. Mr. Chamberlain has placed an item on the credit side of peace. In Germany and France, most people see in Chamberlain and his umbrella a symbol of his dignity, patience and tranquility, which is better than the noisy boasting of dictators in totalitarian countries." Greenwood declared, "One hundred and thirty British ships have been attacked by Franco's forces, and Britain's protests have been repeatedly disregarded. Interference in the Spanish war has intensified, and the danger of war lies with two people, namely Hitler and Mussolini." Foreign Secretary Butler replied on behalf of the government, "The French government has stated to Britain that it is willing to provide a large amount of food and shelter to Spanish refugees crossing the French border. Britain has replied that it is willing to provide further assistance if the situation requires it. We have strictly complied with the conditions of non-intervention." The government's motion to suspend the debate on the issue and postpone it was passed by a majority of 258 votes to 133.</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the British House of Commons last night on his recent trip, saying that the talks were very frank and open. "This discussion did not hope that either party would accept the other's point of view. Although we dare not say that all points have been agreed, the expected goals have been achieved." He repeatedly stated that the meeting was informal in nature, and said, "Mr. Mussolini has stated in advance that Italy's policy is a policy of peace, and when necessary, he will use his power to promote peace." He also stated that the Berlin-Rome axis is the key to Italy's foreign policy, and we also stated that the close cooperation between Britain and France is the basis of British policy. Chamberlain then mentioned the Mediterranean, saying that Mussolini was very satisfied with the provisions of the Anglo-Italian agreement, and repeatedly stated that he was willing to abide by the obligations stipulated in the agreement. Then they proceeded to discuss the adjustment of the borders between Italian East Africa and Sudan and the adjacent British territories, which was in accordance with the provisions of the Anglo-Italian agreement. The Egyptian government will naturally participate in the negotiations on Sudan at that time. "We expressed regret over the recent deterioration in Franco-Italian relations. We understood from subsequent talks that the biggest problem between France and Italy was the Spanish issue. It is difficult for France and Italy to conduct negotiations until the Spanish war ends." Chamberlain continued, "At the same time, Mussolini solemnly stated that Italy will have no demands on Spain after the end of the Spanish war. Foreign Minister Ciano also repeated his original statement to the British government, that Italy has no territorial ambitions in Spain." Regarding the issue of disarmament, Mussolini advocated adopting inquisitive restrictions when the situation permits. Regarding the development of this issue, both sides agreed to maintain contact at any time. Regarding the Jewish issue, Mussolini believed that this was an internal affair and could not be resolved by one country alone, so it must be resolved by broad measures. Chamberlain then recounted his visit to the Pope, saying, "The Pope was touched by the love of the King and Queen for the British people. This is a special honor that cannot be forgotten. The Pope's courage and kindness are deeply moving." Chamberlain continued, "We have now begun to see the results of long-term military preparations. People from all walks of life have seen that our efforts have greatly increased our national defense strength. Our country's power overseas is higher than ever before, and the need for our friendship is also greater than ever before." Mr. Attlee said that the government's appeasement policy has failed, which is inaccurate, and I also believe that the government's policy has gradually succeeded. I hope that our trip to Italy will enhance the friendship between Britain and Italy, but at the same time, I hope that this trip will not weaken our relationship with France. I also believe that the relationship between Britain and France today is closer than we can remember, and this relationship is based on mutual trust, and this mutual trust can only increase.</p>
<p>[Paris, Reuters, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons last night was warmly welcomed in France. Chamberlain emphasized that the British government's policy requires close cooperation between Britain and France. Paris believes that Chamberlain's speech is a great contribution to appeasing the European situation.</p>
<h3 id="e30">British Prime Minister Answers Attlee: Policy on Spain Remains Unchanged, Italy Will Have No Further Demands After the End of the War, Hitler's Speech Expresses Need for Peace <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] During the British House of Commons meeting last night, opposition leader Attlee questioned the Spanish issue, saying that when the British Prime Minister spoke of Mussolini's hope for peace, the country was deeply concerned about Mussolini's interference in the Spanish war, which had lasted for a year and a half. If the Prime Minister could observe the course of this incident, he would be able to appreciate a sense of dissatisfaction that was being revealed in the country. The fact that Italy is fiercely attacking the Catalonia line has overturned the promise to do its utmost to reduce the scope of the incident. Most of the troops that entered Barcelona were Italians, and the fall of Barcelona has been hailed as a great Italian victory. The British government's attitude towards the Spanish issue, apart from the Nyon Agreement, is entirely to encourage aggression. In reply to the questions, the Prime Minister said that at present, the injured, the elderly, and women and children, some of whom have broken arms and legs, are crawling across the mountains on the French-Spanish border, and the suffering is unbearable. If the war spreads, the suffering will be unimaginable. The British government is doing its best to save these unfortunate events, and has first issued 20,000 pounds to the International Committee to assist in the rescue of Spanish children. Another 20,000 pounds will be freely disposed of by the committee. If there is still a need, the government will be prepared to provide more assistance quickly. Regarding the issue of contacting the establishment of a safe zone for Spanish refugees, the Prime Minister said that the government has also notified General Franco, asking him to pay special attention to humanity during the fierce fighting in Catalonia. The Prime Minister also pointed out that before the fall of Barcelona, there was general concern that there would be a massacre, but the result was not so, which should be welcomed by all parties. Speaking of general questions about the government's policy, the Prime Minister said that Britain's policy of non-intervention has always been correct, and he is very satisfied with this, so it is naturally impossible to change it at this time. If you want to change the situation in Spain, you must provide large-scale assistance to the Spanish government to engage in intervention. "I believe that the current situation in Spain does not threaten the peace of Europe, but I believe that the most serious thing is that if we abandon the policy of non-intervention and provide large-scale assistance to the Spanish government to carry out intervention, then peace will be threatened. The result of this intervention will inevitably lead to an expansion of the conflict in Europe, which is exactly the opposite of the British government's policy. The British government's policy is to adopt a strict attitude of impartiality. The reason why we refuse to grant Franco the right to belligerent groups is because this war is not only a civil war, and both sides have foreign intervention, so the situation is becoming complicated." Speaking of the opposition party's declaration of distrust of Mussolini and Hitler, Chamberlain said: "If you want to guarantee that someone can fulfill their promise, and tell them that you do not trust what they say, and that you will take action based on their failure to fulfill their promise, this is the worst method. I am sure that Mr. Attlee is wrong. When we were in Italy, Mussolini and Ciano repeatedly assured us that after the end of the war, there would be no demands on Spain. The policy of stability is now gradually succeeding, and the visit to Rome has not weakened the friendship between Britain and France." Speaking of Hitler's speech, Chamberlain said: "I have a clear impression that viewing Hitler's speech, he is not preparing to cause another crisis in Europe. Throughout the entire speech, there were many places where he expressed that Germany needs peace, the same as other countries, but Europe's confidence cannot be quickly established for a while." Chamberlain concluded: "Before we can obtain a final solution, we must first be able to seek to establish a concrete and sincere cooperation, if not common disarmament, we can also mutually restrict each other. If the time comes when we can find the same spirit as us elsewhere, I know that Britain must be prepared to contribute to general stability."</p>

<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] Yesterday, thousands of people held a rally in the Great War Memorial Square to support Spain, listening to speeches criticizing the government's foreign policy, mostly related to the Spanish issue. Fifty members of the International Brigade who had just returned from Spain also attended the meeting, singing the Internationale. The demonstration marched along Piccadilly Street for an hour, chanting slogans to aid Spain. Traffic was completely blocked. Hundreds of special police were called to suppress the demonstration, and many people were arrested.</p>

<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] British Secretary of State for India, Lord Zetland, said in a speech in Cambridge yesterday that there is no doubt that the British Parliament will approve credit loans to China, and said that they are considering further ways to aid China.</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in the House of Commons last night in response to questions about the situation in China that the important developments in the situation in China in recent weeks have been Japan's announcement on December 22 last year of its revised peace terms and the Chinese government's rejection of these terms, and that there have been no major changes on the battlefield, but the Chinese guerrillas in North China are becoming more active, causing interruptions in railway transportation from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="e33">War Damage Insurance: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Issues Statement, Considering Compensation Measures <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon issued a statement on war damage insurance in the House of Commons last night, saying that the British government's goal is not only to pay attention to those who directly suffer from war damage, but also to be concerned about the general impact on society. The government has been considering compensation measures for those who have suffered from war damage. In terms of property loss, the government has also tried to plan mutual assistance through group insurance methods, but after review, it found that the calculation was very difficult. At the same time, the government is also unwilling for the general society to bear such a huge burden. This does not mean that private property does not need to be protected, but this kind of assistance can only come from post-disaster relief. When property losses are accurately assessed, public funds can be used to provide relief within a possible range. This kind of matter will be handled by the Compensation Committee. People's losses can be registered and requested directly from the National Finance Department.</p>
<p>[London, Central News Agency, 1st] The Ministry of War recently stated that the number of people applying to join the volunteer national service is unusually enthusiastic, exceeding the quota, and the recruitment has been temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>[Washington, Associated Press, January 31st] Undersecretary of the Navy Edison told the House Naval Affairs Committee that whether the Navy Department intends to build strong air and naval bases on Guam will be determined by the development of the international situation. At present, the Navy Department is only considering the Vinson proposal, that is, opening a deep-sea port and building the initial equipment for an air base, which requires approximately $5 million. Republican Maas declared that he would propose amending the Vinson proposal, authorizing the Navy Department to strengthen the defense of Guam and build other air bases if necessary.</p>

<p>[Rome, Central News Agency, 1st] Mussolini recently corresponded with Hitler, reaffirming the friendly relations between Germany and Italy, expressing sincere unity. It is reported that Mussolini decided to put forward his "wishes" for the Mediterranean to France earlier because Hitler declared that Germany would help Italy once the war broke out. Italian officials are currently inciting anti-French sentiments among the public in public. Judging from the current situation, if Mussolini's bloodless victory strategy fails, Italy will definitely take tough measures.</p>

<p>[Washington, Associated Press, January 31st] Several members of the Senate Armed Services Committee declared after discussing with President Roosevelt for an hour that President Roosevelt is now closely cooperating with Britain and France to resist the threat of totalitarian countries to the democratic countries of the world. It is said that the committee members discussed the international situation with President Roosevelt, and the President paid great attention to foreign affairs, and told the Military Committee that it is necessary to strengthen the defense of the United States. The members of the committee kept the President's talks secret. According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt discussed the threat to world peace and feared that war could not be avoided forever. A committee member said, "I think President Roosevelt eagerly told us the seriousness of the world situation and told us that we should strengthen national defense without investigating unimportant matters."</p>

<p>[New York, Reuters, 1st] Newspapers here are today publishing shocking news about President Roosevelt holding a meeting with several members of the Senate Military Committee. The New York Times said, "Members of the Military Committee said after meeting President Roosevelt that the President will do his best to support democratic countries to resist authoritarianism. It is heard that President Roosevelt has declared to the committee members that France should be regarded as the real boundary of the conflict between democratic countries and authoritarian countries." The "Tribune Forum" said, "There is an understanding between the United States and European democratic countries. It is heard that President Roosevelt has declared, "The leaders of the European democratic countries must know my position." The President's meeting with the Military Committee was to discuss the issue of France ordering a large number of aircraft from the United States. The number of aircraft ordered is the largest in the past 25 years. The committee members all remained silent after meeting with President Roosevelt. It is said that President Roosevelt said that he does not hope to see American troops fighting again on foreign soil, but the United States must do its best to help Britain and France.</p>

One of the purposes of this policy is to help democratic countries. President Roosevelt told us that he is the commander-in-chief of the US Army and Navy, so he has the right to approve or reject the sale of aircraft, so the Military Committee does not need to inquire about the sale of aircraft to France. The US government will encourage foreign countries to order aircraft from the US in the next two years. However, President Roosevelt declared that there was no detailed explanation of this matter, so it is not yet known whether his remarks on encouraging foreign countries to order aircraft from the US include all foreign governments."</p>

<h3 id="e42">Short Commentary: The Issue of Sublessor Evictions <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Since the war extended to southern China, the population of Hong Kong has increased sharply, and disputes between landlords and tenants have occurred frequently. Therefore, the Legislative Council enacted the "1938 Restriction of Evictions Ordinance." Recently, the situation in China has become more urgent, and the number of people residing in Hong Kong has continued to increase. What is needed in the social environment is only what is stipulated in the above law, and it is still felt to be insufficient. At today's meeting of the Legislative Council to revise various bills, the Attorney General will reportedly make revisions to the Restriction of Evictions Ordinance. This is truly a good policy for the welfare of Hong Kong residents, and it is also the only important task for maintaining social order in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Thinking deeply, the issue of housing is superficially the relationship between landlords and tenants. In fact, in addition to landlords and tenants, there are also people who profit from it, thereby increasing the suffering of tenants and causing landlords to bear various bad names on their behalf. Who are these people? That is, a portion of those commonly known as sublessors. Subleasing is a long-standing custom, and not all sublessors are people who profit from it, but some of them, under the name of sublessors, illegally act in ways that are detrimental to tenants and cause landlords to suffer on their behalf. Especially for foreigners, due to language barriers, there is often more pressure that is beyond reason. For example, the term "shoe money" and the custom of "lease transfer" can be used to trick tenants into paying money that they should not have to pay by taking advantage of the landlord's premises. In fact, "shoe money" is the money given to the landlord's runner. What the landlord does not need can be falsely presented as a reduction in rent to forcefully take dozens of dollars from the tenant. Lease transfer is a clause that landlords do not usually allow in rental contracts, but they can call it a common practice and transfer the lease at any time, evicting tenants at any time, thereby taking advantage of the situation and profiting endlessly. There are other similar or even worse situations that are difficult to list.</p>
<p>In short, landlord evictions are still known to the public, but sublessor evictions have not received attention. The former has laws to restrict it, but the latter is harmful not only to tenants, but also to landlords, and it has not been heard that there are any laws to sanction it, which is extremely unfair. For the sake of the welfare of the people of Hong Kong society, this is specially put forward for the Legislative Council's reference.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Success of European Appeasement? <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons on the 31st evening, stating that although the Anglo-Italian Roman talks did not achieve any special results, the European appeasement policy had already been successful. He was confident that both Germany and Italy shared a desire for peace. It seems that Chamberlain's policy of compromise and diplomacy has been successful, but what is the reality?</p>
<p>Yes, Chamberlain has succeeded, but what he has succeeded in is not European peace, but only the expansion of war planned by the leaders of the monopoly capital led by [omitted]. The fact is very obvious. After the Rome talks, the Italian invaders were victorious in Spain, and the German invaders reiterated their demands for the division of colonies. The European war crisis has advanced a step, and the opportunity for monopoly capital leaders to profit has increased even more. However, the British and French [omitted] while the forces of democratic peace were further suppressed. Therefore, the success of appeasement is not tranquility, but the mad preparation for a future great war!</p>
<p>In fact, our observation is by no means speculation or arbitrariness. People of vision around the world share the same feeling. Senator King of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee once pointed out that "Hitler and Mussolini have a conspiracy to change the map," but Mr. Chamberlain's so-called "success of appeasement" will be the success of the fascist aggressors in suppressing democracy and peace forces. Furthermore, the leader of the British Liberal Party, Mr. Sinclair, pointed out publicly in the British House of Commons, "Although we A (referring to Britain) are rearming, we are gradually losing the support of important and powerful forces abroad!" This is worthy of prompting the British government to reflect deeply.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Overview of the Singapore Military Base <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— (Original by John Gunther, translated by Hong Sheng)</p>
<p>The construction cost of the Singapore base is indeed considerable. Strangely enough, this huge sum of money all came from [omitted]. According to official estimates, the total cost of the base is US$80.55 million, of which the naval base alone cost US$38.5 million to US$45 million.</p>
<p>The floating dock is valued at US$4.805 million, and the towing fee from [omitted] to Singapore is US$1 million, including the Suez Canal transit tax of US$50,000. The Seletar Air Force base is valued at US$3.55 million, and there are two aircraft [omitted] each valued at US$1.75 million.</p>
<p>However, unofficial estimates are even higher. If the salaries of officers and soldiers and all indirect expenses are included, the cost is no less than US$250 million.</p>
<p>The sources of this money are varied: the Straits Settlements supplied the land for Seletar, valued at US$750,000, New Zealand contributed US$5 million, and Hong Kong contributed US$1.25 million. Australia did not contribute money, but built a navy.</p>
<p>The wealthy Malayan Peninsula above Singapore is divided into two parts, direct and non-direct. The direct part—under the direct jurisdiction of the British headquarters—supplied US$1 million in cash and two Royal Air Force squadrons worth US$1.5 million. The political independence of the non-direct part is no greater than that of the direct part. Among them, the Sultan of Johor supplied US$2.5 million. In total, the above-mentioned contributions totaled US$21 million, accounting for slightly less than a quarter of the total value of the base.</p>
<p>In addition, up to 1933, the Straits Settlements also provided cash of 60 million local currency (one local currency dollar is equal to US$0.58). After 1933, it also contributed a fixed annual contribution of 4 million local currency, plus a special contribution of 1.5 million local currency in the past three years. Therefore, the total contribution of the Straits Settlements to the base is no less than 81.5 million local currency, equivalent to about US$47.5 million.</p>
<p>Adding the cash contributed by the Straits Settlements to the above-mentioned contributions, the total is US$68.5 million. Subtracting this number from the [omitted] value of US$80.55 million, the difference is US$12.05 million, which is paid from the British headquarters' budget. It is really very cheap. Excluding the annual maintenance of US$2.5 million, what the Singapore base asks of the British headquarters is truly minimal.</p>
<p>Twenty percent of the total revenue of the Straits Settlements comes from opium sales. This treasure business is a government monopoly. Britain buys raw opium from Iran or India and processes it into opium paste, which is packaged in small metal tubes. One local currency dollar can buy one Singapore liang (equivalent to one and one-third ounces) of raw opium; while one liang of opium paste costs [omitted] 12 dollars. The interest is considerable, but it also implies prohibition, deliberately raising the price to reduce sales.</p>
<p>The sale of [omitted] is strictly controlled; only registered addicts can purchase it, and those who want to join the addict's [omitted] must have a doctor's certificate.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the government, considering that opium transportation might be prohibited by international [omitted] joint action, promulgated a method of opium subsidy fund, extracting 10% of the annual opium tax for separate safekeeping. This fund has now accumulated to 30 million local currency, and it is no longer necessary to increase it. Therefore, it is said that the [omitted] 35,000 registered smokers simply bear one-fifth of the funds contributed by the Straits Settlements to the base.</p>
<p>On the day the base was completed, the arrival of the U.S. fleet caused panic among many people in the world. In this Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese forces are advancing southward day by day, and the completion of the Singapore base will certainly give Japan a considerable [omitted] color.</p>
<p>Soon, Britain declared again, "If necessary, Britain is prepared to lease all the facilities of the new naval base to the United States for use." In other words, if war breaks out, Britain will reverse and welcome the Americans to Singapore.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Americans are also happy to do so, because west of Hawaii, she has no [omitted] place to repair large ships. Once something happens in the Far East, the Singapore dock can meet her needs.</p>
<p>According to the most reliable military observation results, the base is only likely to be attacked by the enemy on the mainland directly to the north. A sea attack is simply impossible, and an air raid [omitted] can only damage the base and cannot occupy it. If the enemy attempts to occupy Singapore, they can only land infantry in Malaya or Siam and then advance southward. This is the reason for increasing military airfields in these two places.</p>
<p>The most commendable aspect of Singapore is its location, only 1,578 miles from Manila, only 1,674 miles from Hong Kong, and 3,345 miles from Yokohama. Although Japan is building an important air force base in Taiwan [omitted], if it wants to launch a full-scale naval attack, it must [omitted] add at least 3,000 miles of firepower to be effective, and such a voyage has exceeded the limits that modern expeditionary warships should have.</p>
<p>In fact, the main target of naval warfare is commerce rather than enemy ships. One of the important tasks of the Pacific War is to cut off the transportation of Japanese merchant ships, plus a blockade, which can kill Japan. To achieve this goal, Singapore is the most ideal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Singapore's neighboring land is an absolutely safe place. It can be said that there is no political activity, such as national movements, in Malaya. Imagine placing a British military base in Egypt, Iraq, or India, where the political situation is a very serious problem. And Singapore has the most perfect air force facilities, which is much more convenient than Gibraltar, which has no good airport.</p>
<p>Therefore, concentrating military power in Singapore has several functions: giving the British Navy a oil depot and repair dock, giving Hong Kong a military backing, and protecting Australia, Colombo, and Calcutta at the same time. It establishes an armored defensive building in the center of the British colony, becoming the hub of Eurasian transportation.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it gives Japan a warning. The base seems to firmly tell Japan that Britain will never give up its commercial interests in this part of the world. Speaking of this, one cannot help but recall a saying by the late Marshal Roberts that one day the history of the world will be decided in Singapore, and perhaps Britain is waiting for that day to come.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hankou, our people are scattered everywhere. Specialized talents are especially sparse. Our authorities believe that specialized talents cannot be ignored in this sacred war of resistance. In order to concentrate them for service, the Special Personnel Service Regulations in Extraordinary Times are promulgated. All specialized personnel must register with the designated agency of the Executive Yuan in the following items: (A) name, age, gender, place of origin, and residence; (B) education and experience; (C) if there is a current position, it must be reported so that they can undertake war work.</p>

<p>Since the Hong Kong branch of the China Wartime Child Care Association obtained the obstetrics room of the old National Hospital from the government as the Association's Third Child Care Hospital, the Association has actively implemented renovations. At the same time, plans have been made to arrange everything. It is now about to be completed. After the hospital is repaired, it will be used to accommodate the existing babies in various hospitals and the refugee babies found in the First Hospital in Yuen Long, totaling about 50. The hospital began accepting admissions this Sunday. There are currently 14 children transferred from the First Hospital in Yuen Long and more than 10 from Kwong Wah Hospital. As for the hospital's expenses, the British Relief Fund now donates HK$500 per month. However, the consumption of babies is exceptionally high. In terms of milk powder alone, each baby needs HK$15 per month. In addition to various other expenses, the hospital is currently in urgent need of baby grains and food. Donations from charitable people in all sectors are hoped for.</p>

<p>There have been rumors that the Kowloon Motor Bus Company will trial run double-decker buses. According to reliable sources, two such buses will soon appear on London Road. At that time, the traffic department of the police station will monitor the trial run. If it is found that there are trees that hinder the run, they will be cut down. The Hong Kong government authorities will probably not prohibit the trial run of these new vehicles. Judging from the current situation, at most one or two large trees will be cut down. The remaining trees will be slightly pruned. The existing street lighting equipment on various roads is sufficient to provide adequate lighting. As for the recent replacement of street lamps with gas lamps on Nathan Road and other roads by the Hong Kong government, if it is suspected that this is related to the running of double-decker buses, it is not true. This move was decided by the government long ago.</p>

<p>Leaders of our country's industrial circles and friendly people who sympathize with our country organized the China Industrial Advancement Cooperative Association in Shanghai a few years ago to revitalize various important light industries in order to solve the unemployment problem of workers in the war zone. At that time, all plans were drafted by the industrial giant Xu Xinliu and submitted to the National Government for adoption. Kong Xiangxi and Madame Song Meiling also enthusiastically assisted in this relief plan. Later, the association moved from Shanghai to Hankou. After the fall of Hankou, it moved to Chongqing to work and established branches in other major domestic cities to assist in the progress. Hong Kong also had this organization. Later, because members went to work in the interior, the Hong Kong association dissolved invisibly. Recently, the association sent a representative, Ms. Ellen, to Hong Kong to re-organize again and sent letters to prominent figures in Hong Kong, holding a symposium at the Gloucester Building Emergency Refugee Relief Association yesterday to discuss all progress matters.</p>

<p>After the success of the Trade Control Commission of the Ministry of Finance of our country in controlling trade, in order to replenish the foreign exchange fund, it specially ordered that the main native products of the country be concentrated in Hong Kong for export. Since the implementation, domestic goods have been handled in accordance with the regulations, transported from the mainland to Hong Kong, and then shipped for export. In the past twelve months last year, mineral ore exports ranked first among the country's goods, with a total value of CN¥80,075,442. Tung oil was second, with a total export value for the year of CN¥30,096,066. The value of the exported native products is recorded as follows: (1) Tea, 239,099 quintals, valued at CN¥17,672,659; (2) Tung oil, 558,100 quintals, valued at CN¥30,096,066; (3) Cloth, valued at CN¥12,691,994; (4) Mineral ore, valued at CN¥80,075,442; (5) Animal and plant products, valued at CN¥21,647,962; (6) Medicinal materials, CN¥7,484,193; (7) Vegetables, CN¥5,744,022; (8) Plant products, valued at CN¥3,811,907; (9) Native paper, valued at CN¥2,268,167; (10) Yarn and fabrics, valued at CN¥13,011,660; (11) Chemical products, CN¥2,260,860; (12) Sundries, CN¥9,788,949; (13) Leather, valued at CN¥4,344,688; (14) Seafood, valued at CN¥1,388,378, totaling CN¥201,380,156.</p>

<h3 id="e54">The Problem of Transporting Stored Rice Northward from Hong Kong <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Ren</p>
<p>[Omitted]. For this reason, the reporter specially visited Yang Yongxiu, chairman of the Rice Merchants' Association, to inquire about and discuss the above-mentioned incident. Mr. Yang analyzed the problem in detail. According to him:</p>
<p>"The operation of rice in Hong Kong roughly has three stages. The first stage is the North-South firms, which are the agencies that directly collect and transport Annam and Siam rice. However, they are only agents. The Annam rice owners have the right to designate the sale to a certain customer, and the North-South firms have no possibility of interfering. After the transaction is completed, the North-South firms deliver the goods for the rice owners, and the task is completed. The profit obtained is a certain amount of commission. The second stage is the Rice Merchants' Association, which can be said to be a group of distributors. They purchase a batch of goods from the North-South firms, break them down into smaller quantities, and distribute them to rice stores for retail. They are limited to Hong Kong and never transport them to other places. The third stage is the Rice Industry Association, which is a group of rice stores. They have even less importance for this issue, because they are only retail rice stores. The number of purchases is not large, and it is no longer possible to transport them in large quantities.</p>
<p>"Now that we understand the situation of the rice industry in Hong Kong, we can review the problem of transporting stored rice northward. The actual responsibility is neither with the Rice Merchants' Association nor with the Rice Industry Association, so is it the responsibility of the North-South firms? But it cannot be said that either. As discussed above, the North-South firms are only agents and have absolutely no ability to choose customers. [Omitted].</p>
<p>"Secondly, there is one more point to note. The Shandong and Tianjin gangs have had decades of historical relations with the North-South firms. Before the war, they constantly transported southern goods such as rice northward and transported northern goods to the south at the same time. This back-and-forth was their business for making a living. For decades, there was no interruption. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the coast was [omitted] blockaded, and the North-South cargo transportation was also affected. There were two periods in the middle when it was suspended. The transactions between the Tianjin and Shandong gangs and the North-South firms were therefore interrupted. Until the end of last year, the War of Resistance entered a new stage. Because of the improvement of the port, the North-South shipping industry gradually recovered. Therefore, the Tianjin and Shandong gangs continued to purchase goods for transportation northward. North-South trade gradually returned to its old appearance. Rice is certainly one of the main goods they purchased. Currently, it may be a fact that Hong Kong rice is being transported northward.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Notifies Overseas Chinese, Denouncing [Omitted] Propaganda and Inducements; [Omitted] Forcefully Induces Overseas Chinese to Return to Live in Occupied Areas; [Omitted]. <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Since the full-scale War of Resistance, people in the occupied areas have mostly left their homes painfully, unwilling to be refugees. Those who are rich seek safe areas to temporarily reside, and those who are poor are displaced and beg for accommodation and relief everywhere to survive. Therefore, most of the occupied areas are empty, like dead cities. [Omitted] then does not hesitate to make propaganda in an attempt to lure our people to return to live in the occupied areas. In view of this, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission specially issued a fast mail telegram. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also received a copy yesterday. The original text is excerpted as follows: (Title omitted) All are aware that according to intelligence, [omitted] recently sent Lieutenant Colonel Sagi Shigeru, a responsible officer stationed in Shanghai of the General Staff Headquarters, to promote to various overseas Chinese, guaranteeing the safety of their families, facilitating communication and remittance, and protecting their Nanyang business to induce them, etc. Since [omitted] invaded our country, they have spared no effort to use all aspects of the military government. Overseas Chinese living in territories cannot be oppressed by violence, and because they are enthusiastic patriots and wealthy, they use false propaganda and use tricks to win them over. This special telegram is sent to denounce and break the conspiracy. As for the statement that "guarantee the safety of their hometown families," wherever [omitted] goes, [omitted], [omitted] is the law. Many of our hometown families of overseas Chinese have been victimized. Now suddenly saying "guarantee the safety of their hometown families" is to use soft means to put our overseas Chinese in the ranks of traitors or submissive people. However, traitors are difficult to be safe. For example, Li Wanyong, who betrayed Korea, and the latter, such as those killed in various places, can be used as a warning for traitors. As for submissive people, those in Korea, Taiwan, Ryukyu, and the four northeastern provinces and occupied areas, [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] Where is the safety? Our overseas Chinese deeply understand the righteousness and vigorously help the War of Resistance. The final victory will surely be liberated. How can they be tempted by this sweet talk to turn against their enemies, betray their motherland, and make their hometown descendants slaves of the country and be slaughtered by [omitted]? As for the statement that "all communication and remittance facilities will be provided," it is even more insidious. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been relatively difficult for overseas Chinese to remit money to their families. However, regarding remittances from overseas Chinese, this association has previously requested the Ministry of Finance to entrust domestic and foreign banks to manage as much as possible, which has been proceeding smoothly for a long time. Why rely on [omitted]? Moreover, [omitted] uses military tickets with no reserve and no value in the occupied areas. If overseas Chinese remittances mistakenly enter [omitted]'s bank, then [omitted] can absorb existing funds and increase foreign exchange financial resources, while what our overseas Chinese hometowns (those in the war zone) get is a military ticket that is said to be empty. It is tantamount to assisting [omitted] with money to invade the motherland and trap their hometowns. As for the statement that "protect their Nanyang business," it is even more ridiculous. Nanyang is not the territory of [omitted]. Overseas Chinese operate here, and they are protected by local laws. They do not need to rely on other countries, nor can they be destroyed by other countries. In short, after the War of Resistance exceeded 17 months, [omitted] suffered huge losses. Under this declining trend, [omitted] does not hesitate to use despicable means to provoke and sow discord in order to achieve their goals. This is a common trick of [omitted], and it is not surprising. It is only feared that overseas Chinese care about their hometowns or may be confused by them and waver in their beliefs. Therefore, this telegram is sent to refute so that our overseas Chinese can understand the truth and see through [omitted]'s conspiracy.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee of the Hong Kong Legislative Council will meet today after the Legislative Council meeting. The Colonial Secretary, Smith, will approve 1,698,573 yuan for government expenses, of which 1,261,126 yuan is the additional amount required to cover the shortfall in items 307 to 330 of last year's expenditure budget. The remaining 437,447 yuan is the additional budget for this year. At the same time, the government intends to allocate unallocated deposits to cover this government expenditure. As of last year, these deposits totaled 890,974 yuan. The Colonial Secretary also pointed out that the Hong Kong government has fixed-term debts that are paid directly by the government and do not need to be allocated from the treasury surplus. This amount totals 312,641 yuan. As for the additional government expenses last year, 60,800 yuan was used by the Health Bureau to purchase a launch, and Kai Tak Airport also spent 6,534 yuan to purchase a launch. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway suffered considerable damage to its vehicles due to frequent bombings, and the repair costs reached 5,285 yuan. Due to the current situation, the police also incurred an additional 25,000 yuan in expenses, including the cost of accommodating Chinese soldiers. The additional government expenses for this quarter include the cost of refugee camps and losses due to typhoons. Tung Wah Hospital is the largest Chinese charitable organization in Hong Kong, with very large annual expenses. In addition to enthusiastic donations from people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, it also receives a government subsidy of 121,000 yuan. However, due to the Sino-Japanese War, many refugees came to Hong Kong in the past year. Most of them were displaced and in urgent need of relief, so Tung Wah Hospital had to engage in refugee relief work, resulting in huge expenditures. The hospital's medical committee requested the government to increase the subsidy by 150,000 yuan due to insufficient funds. The government considered the amount to be quite large and had to consult the British Colonial Secretary, which has now been approved. The Finance Committee of the Legislative Council will approve this subsidy at today's (2nd) meeting.</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3 id="e60">Travel Notes from Chongqing <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>A traveler passing through Sichuan, even if just a fleeting glance, will inevitably have two impressions that cannot be erased: one is the river, and the other is the fog. A boat passing through Yichang is like an ant threading a bead, searching for a path in the mountain crevices all day long. Arriving directly at Chongqing, the terrain remains the same. In winter, the river water recedes, and the Yangtze River becomes a line, deeply sunken at the bottom of the mountains, while the two banks become even steeper. Those who have not left the Kui Gate may not believe in the vastness of the downstream Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Chongqing's terrain is like a peninsula, with a range of mountains between the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. South of the Yangtze River, people live along the mountains, in villages and settlements, connected intermittently, collectively known as the South Bank. North of the Jialing River, a city sits high on the ridge, facing Chongqing, which is Jiangbei County. When travelers come west by boat, they only see mountain light on all sides and city shadows on three sides, misty and hazy, and they do not know where Chongqing is. Some think that Chongqing's terrain is like a concrete and miniature version of the three towns of Wuhan, but in fact, Wuhan is grand, and the mountains and rivers of Chongqing are also majestic, and it is certainly not a miniature version.</p>
<p>Chongqing is built on mountains, and the streets are extremely intricate. The old streets and alleys have high and low slopes, making walking frequently up and down. The new streets are grand and winding, making walking time-consuming. Therefore, when people from downstream arrive here, asking for directions and visiting friends is initially uncomfortable. However, in places like Douyou Street, Huixian Bridge, and Xiaoliangzi, there are tall buildings lining the streets, reaching five or six stories, with asphalt roads circling below like belts, and pedestrians gathering like ants, which also resembles a modern city.</p>
<p>Here, land prices are not high, but the terrain is rugged and cannot be expanded. Therefore, builders build houses from high to low, cutting mountains to make slopes, living in low places facing high places, or building pavilions on the cliffs. Since the plane cannot be expanded, they engage in stacking houses up and down. It is well known that houses are stacked upward into floors and pavilions. Stacking downward is a unique architecture in Sichuan. The method is either to build houses along the slope, gradually sloping down, or to build suspended pavilions at the bottom of the slope, with two or three floors of buildings above to extend beyond the ground. Therefore, in other places, you must go downstairs to go out, but here, you must go upstairs to go out, which is also common. Those who suddenly see this type of building are not surprised. I still remember visiting a friend once, the vermilion door in front of the house had beast rings, looking like a wealthy family. When the door was opened, it was empty and without anything, allowing you to see the white clouds. Looking down, there were twenty or thirty steps down to the courtyard, standing at the door, viewing the roof tiles as if they were in your palm. Isn't that interesting?</p>
<p>Building floors is common in Sichuan, but the cost is surprisingly low. Steel and cement construction is rare, and even brick walls with solid foundations are not easy to find. Most of them are made of wood frames and bamboo walls. When a guest goes upstairs, the whole house moves. Ordinary people who have lived here for generations are not surprised. Moreover, shops on the main streets are ten zhang high, with bright window decorations and a variety of goods. Looking at the exterior, they look like Shanghai and Wuhan. However, when you knock on the walls, they sound like drums, because they are made of brick columns, with double layers of wooden strips nailed between the two columns as partition walls. The partition walls are plastered with mud, making the walls about a foot thick, but in fact, they are hollow and cannot withstand punches. Nearby merchants may not feel that it is inappropriate and intend to improve, but renovating the entire city is not easy to say.</p>
<p>Travelers in Sichuan say that Chengdu is like a small Beiping, and Chongqing is like a small Shanghai. In terms of human feelings and customs, it is generally close to the truth. However, because Chongqing follows Shanghai, the city is located among overlapping mountains and ridges, without any forest and spring arrangements. Guests who want to take a suburban tour should cross the river to Haitangxi (the first station of the Southwest Highway) and then take a long-distance bus for fifteen kilometers to Nan Hot Springs for a day trip. The hot springs are abbreviated as Nanquan, and commonly known as Nanwentang. Near the station, you can find a clear stream between the two mountains, with a gentle breeze and calm water. Slowly advance in a small boat in the creek for five or six miles to reach the marketplace (in Sichuan, townships are called marketplaces, so going to the market is called "going to the marketplace"). There is a park, a youth association hotel, and a restaurant in the marketplace, just like a city. The springs are stored as swimming pools, and tickets are sold separately. There are also small bathrooms that release water at certain times to allow travelers to take a bath. The temperature of the spring is slightly higher than the temperature of our skin. Washing away the dust and relaxing the heart. Generally speaking, the best hot springs are those with small peaks on either side, with a shallow valley in the middle, which is not bad. However, the marketplace buildings are scattered and need special organization.</p>
<p>There is a park in the urban area, which is built on part of a high slope. Although some flowers and trees are planted, with pavilions and kiosks, the location is in the bustling city, without any twists and turns. Except for sipping tea in the long pavilion tea house and overlooking the Yangtze River, it is not worth mentioning. Those who live in Chongqing and want to be close to nature should go out of the new urban area, north past Shangqing Temple, and go forward along the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, walking a small step up Guanshan waist. This place is the neck of the peninsula. The green peaks are towering, and the forests are lush. The Jialing River meanders and lies hundreds of feet below the road. White sails are like feathers, disappearing into the mountain crevices, creating a deep sense of painting. I once came here with a friend in late spring. At that time, the smoke cleared and the sun rose, and I saw the peaks on either side of the river, surrounded by overlapping layers. I did not know where the river came from. The difficulty of the Sichuan road can be seen here. There are many cuckoos in Sichuan, and the green leaves are deep, with chaotic cries throughout the mountains. I climbed the branches and looked east at the river, thinking of the Tang people's poem, "Frequently sending two lines of tears to the flow towards the old garden," and discussed it with my friend.</p>
<p>Futu Pass refers to the top of the mountain. There used to be a tower, but it is gone. Climbing the mountain, the Yangtze River is on the left and the Jialing River is on the right. The two rivers are like double jade belts, surrounding the mountains. You can see everything clearly. Looking around, the cloud peaks and misty ridges make people feel that the mountains and rivers are vast. Someone built a garden on the side of the peak, with a slight arrangement of hills and valleys, and you can visit after submitting a name card.</p>
<p>If you live in Chongqing and want to visit and explore, you must go a long way, or at least cross the river to the south. In the second and third months of spring, peach and plum blossoms bloom all over the mountains, so it is appropriate to travel in the Nanshan Mountains. In summer, the trees are shady, and you can visit Laojun Cave. However, the author's mood is bleak, and he has repeatedly mentioned travel but has been repeatedly stopped. I am ashamed that I have nothing to tell the readers. Beipei in eastern Sichuan is like the West Lake in Zhejiang. Those who come to Chongqing must take a trip to it. I have repeatedly violated my friends' appointments, only reducing the elegance of the trip, let alone climbing Mount Emei and Qingcheng Mountain in the distance.</p>
<p>The climate in Sichuan is mild, and there is no severe cold in winter. Therefore, the phoenix trees turn yellow late, and the elms and poplars sprout early. Chengdu is known as the Hibiscus City, and Chongqing also has all kinds of flowers. There are three or four flower markets in the mountain city, with red and purple flowers displayed daily for guests to choose from. Moreover, the flower prices are extremely low. A handful of roses is only a dime, and a large branch of sweet osmanthus only costs a few cents. Peonies, jasmine, and white orchids are also willing to sell branches, which is not available elsewhere. When the author was writing this manuscript, there were five or six bottles of chrysanthemums in the room, with various good varieties such as lotus petals and crab claws, costing only two or three dimes. A bottle on the desk is even supplied with daffodils. This is something that Jiangbei flower lovers have not even dreamed of.</p>
<p>Some people say that Guiyang is full of black smoke and miasma, and Chongqing is dark and sunless. This is a joke, but it is also a fact. According to the author's experience in Sichuan, the fog and miasma season generally begins in November of the lunar calendar and gradually clears up in March of the following year. Even when it is clear, it is still rainy from time to time and cannot be sunny for long. If you are not accustomed to traveling for a long time, and suddenly enter Sichuan, it will be difficult to maintain your health for a long time. During the fog season, there is no sunlight during the day and no stars and moon at night. The sky is dark gray, and you cannot distinguish the time of day. In the morning and evening, there is even more wet fog, with clouds and fog filling the air, so that you cannot see anything a few feet away. Therefore, the spring night moon and the winter sunrise are rarely seen by the people of Sichuan. Also, there are no strong winds here, and there is little frost and snow. The vegetation is lush, probably because of this.</p>
<p>People only know that the people of Sichuan like spicy food, but they do not know that the people of Sichuan also like sweets. In addition to teahouses and taverns, there are also sweet food shops here, specializing in selling jujube cakes and other foods. In particular, sesame rice balls in chicken oil are very popular. Some say that in the past, before the opium ban was implemented, this was provided for addicts. However, observing the banquets of Chongqing people, there are always many sweets, so the above statement may not be entirely true. There is a dish called "sandwiched meat," which is made by cutting fatty meat into slices and sandwiching them with mashed beans until they are cooked. It is then eaten with heavy sugar, which makes people feel greasy, but the people of Chongqing regard it as a treasure. This is also evidence of a love for sweets. As for rice, it must be served with peppers, which is a common phenomenon. I also like spicy food and follow the people of Sichuan closely. However, when the people of Sichuan formally entertain guests, spicy dishes are not served. People from Jiangnan who have an appointment with the people of Sichuan do not need to fear peppers and ginger.</p>
<p>Sichuan is known to the world as the "Land of Abundance." However, in recent years, times have changed, and wealth is in the upper class. Therefore, more than ten miles around the new urban area are filled with red buildings and green railings, mixed with mountain peaks, bamboo, and trees. Going out of Tongyuan Gate to Shangqing Temple is like going on the Shanxi Road of Nanjing. I have often knocked on the doors of the mansions, and the sophistication of the architecture and the completeness of the equipment is something that even the homes of Shanghai expatriates may not have. If a newcomer is unfortunate enough to land at Linjiangmen and see bamboo walls and wooden houses, with ordinary people and chickens and pigeons gathered there.</p>
<p>Guangdong people call people from other provinces "Waijiang Lao" (outer river folks), while Sichuan people call people from other provinces "Xiajiang Ren" (lower river people). If a person cannot speak Western Mandarin (Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou), even if they come from Gansu and Qinghai, they are still in the ranks of Xiajiang people. A Sichuan proverb says that "lower" is called "the soles of the feet," so people from Xiajiang are commonly called "people from under the soles of the feet." If a guest does not know the reason and suddenly hears this, they will surely turn pale with anger. Their customs are like this, so there is no intention of insulting. Since October of last year, people from under the feet and goods from under the feet have filled the markets of Chongqing. The shop signs are displayed, not written with Nanjing, but with Shanghai. In the fifth branch of Xiaobu, Northern and Southern dialects can be heard in abundance. Since the power of the guests has shifted, the distinction between Upper and Lower Rivers is probably not easy to maintain.</p>
<p>Sichuan cuisine is famous in the country, and is comparable to Cantonese cuisine. In recent years, in Northern and Southern cities, Sichuan restaurants have sprung up everywhere, and their prosperity is evident. However, in Chongqing, pure Sichuan restaurants have dim business and are not worth mentioning. The only ones that can still be regarded as a benchmark are the chefs who have returned to Sichuan from Beijing and Shanghai, using "Xiajiang Sichuan cuisine" as their banner. Then we realize that the Sichuan cuisine we tasted outside the door was not true Sichuan cuisine. There are many large and small restaurants in Chongqing, almost one building every five steps and one pavilion every ten steps. After the influx of guest people, Tianjin, Beijing, Jiangsu, and Guangdong restaurants have sprung up like bamboo shoots, and they seem to be everywhere. Generally speaking, Northern flavors are the most popular, followed by Cantonese flavors, and then Beijing and Jiangsu restaurants. If the managers are good at running the business, the business is not bad. The reasons are as follows: The crown gathers, and banquets are difficult to avoid, one reason. Half of the people who come to Sichuan have no family members, and they regard restaurants as their family kitchens, two reasons. The thought of hometown flavors is something that everyone has, and guests often dine a few days a week to enjoy the flavors of their hometown, three reasons. Local ingredients are used, and the facilities are easy to set up, four reasons. As for Western food, there are no concessions in Chongqing, and prices are restricted, so the price of meals cannot exceed one yuan. Therefore, the restaurant reduces the amount to two dishes and one soup, and the bread is limited to one slice. Even if people like knives and forks, they cannot fill their stomachs with each set, so they leave disappointedly. If you add dishes when eating, the price is also very expensive, and it is not a necessity, so this industry is not thriving.</p>
<p>Chongqing's bathhouses are simple and not as good as those in the Lower River, but they have three characteristics that can be talked about: (1) Every bathhouse has family rooms. It is right to bring your family to bathe together, and it is not forbidden to call prostitutes and joke. (2) There are bathhouses on boats on the river, which also sell seats of different grades. The author heard that it was not very clear, so he did not try to go. However, imagining boiling water on the river, although very convenient, and the awnings are cramped, it should not be very comfortable. (3) The hostels here also run bathhouses. The family rooms are charged by the hour, regardless of the number of people, which is also a wonder.</p>
<p>There are various vehicles for getting around outside the city, such as horses and sedan chairs for long distances, and sedan chairs are used in the urban area. Sedan chairs are convenient for going up and down slopes. They are made of two bamboo poles with a small bamboo seat. The quality is very light, and the carriers are also different from other places. The front is short and the back is long. The sedan chair is shaped like a chair, with bamboo strips clamping a bamboo piece to form a curtain. The curtain is concave at the bottom, just enough to sit on. The seat is covered with bedding, like a rope bed. Bamboo branches are supported on the pole and covered with a cloth tent. People lie half in it, without moving their center of gravity, which is very comfortable. In the northwest of Sichuan, in the basin, there are also small two-wheeled carts. The method of making them is very ancient. When walking, the passenger is in front and the pusher is behind, resembling the objects in Zhong Jinshi's "Marrying a Sister" picture.</p>
<p>People in Sichuan, regardless of men or women, like to wrap their heads with white cloth. The method of wrapping is very simple. The fine cloth is like a huge rope, placing a circle on the head. If it is newly made, it looks like people in the Lower River are in mourning. When asked why, they answer that they fear the wind and cold on their heads. When asked why they don't wear hats, they answer that wrapping cloth is cheaper. In fact, the price of cloth and hats is not very different. The people of Sichuan fear the cold on their heads, but they fear the heat on their feet. Men of the middle and lower classes often go barefoot in straw sandals. In the cold winter, they wear long robes and walk around the market with bare feet, and no one finds it strange. The road in Sichuan is difficult, and the people love to wear straw sandals, which is natural. However, the old habits of the people of China most forbid white on the head, but the people of Sichuan wrap white cloth, and Lu Fangweng has already expressed it in his poems. I don't know when it started, but it is uniquely opposed to the customs of the whole country.</p>
<p>Sichuan opera is also unique in the opera industry. The words and sentences emphasize the elegance of the words. Looking at the script, there are allusions on the paper, similar to Cantonese opera. However, when performing on stage, the singers freely express their tunes according to their roles, without silk and string accompaniment. At the end, the musical instruments play together loudly. More than ten people in the orchestra shout loudly and sing in unison. If you are not used to hearing it, you may feel uneasy. Is this what is meant by "the lower class people and those who harmonize with them are few"? The performances are delicate, and there are also things that Peking opera has not reached. In general, the tragedies are full of tears, and the comedies are extremely obscene. The actors in the drama are outstanding in their roles and are willing to describe them to the extreme. Travelers who have a fondness for Sichuan opera are definitely not seeking singing, but can use words to express it.</p>
<p>Mountain areas like Guizhou are full of stones everywhere, which are barren. Plateaus like Gansu have clay that has no bones, and there is no water source, so they are just vast. Only the mountains of Sichuan have stone below and soil above. Forests are planted in high places, and grains are planted in low places, with not an inch of waste land. The climate is mild, and there can be three or four harvests a year. As for fruits, Chongqing has both pears in the north and lychees in the south, and they are available very early. I tasted cherries in March and chewed olives in August. The oranges and pomelos are especially good. The Guanggan is no different from the Florida oranges sold in Shanghai in terms of color, taste, and smell. After months of storage, you can buy two hundred for one yuan. If the people of the Lower River had known that there was such a good fruit in the country, they would have already taken the place of American oranges.</p>
<p>Literary people are like young girls, good at feeling sentimental, especially when traveling. When writing this article, I wrote it at random, and I couldn't help but express my feelings. After reading it once, I threw it away. What the readers see today is probably five or six out of ten in a mess. Fortunately, the memories are random, forming paragraphs by themselves, and I don't feel that there is any division. One day, when I return to Jiangnan, I will pass through Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong, and I will definitely contribute more to the readers. What I have not said today, I may be able to make up for it in the future. The mountains and rivers are far apart, and I miss my friends. The year is coming to an end, and I wish you all the best.</p>

<p>Q&amp;A Column of China Travel Service</p>
<h3 id="e61">Traveling from Shantou to Yunnan; Answer to Mr. Liao Jianxiang <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Question: (1) What procedures are required to go from Shantou to Haiphong? What is the total cost? Are there regular ships? (2) How to get from Haiphong to Zhenjiang County, Yunnan? What is the cost? (I want to return to Zhenjiang Middle School to resume classes.) (3) Are there any difficulties on the way from Shantou to Zhenjiang? What should travelers pay attention to?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) To go from Shantou to Haiphong, you should first go through passport procedures. First, apply for an exit passport from the Shantou Public Security Bureau. After receiving the passport, ask the French Consulate in Shantou to countersign it. The passport fee is four yuan, the stamp duty is two yuan, and the countersigning fee is a French franc. There are no regular ships from Shantou to Haiphong.</p>
<p>(2) To go from Haiphong to Zhenjiang County, you can first take a train to Hanoi. The third-class ticket price is 1.25 Vietnamese currency. From Hanoi to Kunming, the third-class ticket price is 30.60 Vietnamese currency. After arriving in Kunming, take a bus back to Zhenjiang. There are offices of the Zhongda University in Haiphong and Kunming to take care of you along the way.</p>
<p>(3) If there are difficulties in obtaining a passport in Shantou, you can first send a letter to the Hong Kong office of Zhongshan University in Nanping for inquiries.</p>

<p>(2) What are the difficulties in exporting laborers? Details are unknown.</p>
<p>—Shipping News—</p>
<p>The "Hong Kong Sea Dragon" wooden boat, which caused a sensation, has been docked at Kowloon Wharf No. 1 Bridge from the Bailey Shipyard for ten days. It was originally planned to depart for the United States on Saturday, but due to various unfinished procedures, it has not been able to leave. When test sailing the day before yesterday, a Western crew member accidentally injured his foot and was taken to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. Therefore, the departure date is still uncertain. It is reported that two Chinese crew members are needed on the day of departure and they are being sought. As for the structure of the boat, there is nothing special about it, just like the so-called "big eye chicken" boats in Hong Kong, except that the decorations are more luxurious and it has an extra engine. The strangest thing is that the boat is fully equipped with everything, such as shrines and Buddha statues, filled with superstitious colors. On the day of its trial voyage, a Taoist priest was hired to perform a "prosperous boat" ritual, burning incense and chanting incantations. While the priest chanted, the Western crew members bowed in place of prostrations, obeying the priest's instructions. Onlookers couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>The "Jiaotong" ship of the Taisheng Company sailed out of the dock yesterday and will depart for Macau every day at 2:30 AM, returning to Hong Kong at 3:30 AM the next morning. Its sister ship "Haojiang" is undergoing repairs in the dock.</p>
<p>The "Sihua Hualuli" ship, represented by the Prince Company, arrived in Hong Kong this morning from Ballaney in South Africa, but it did not transport any goods. It is here for repairs at the Kowloon Dock.</p>
<p>The "Maosheng" ship of Jardine Matheson is currently under repair at the Kowloon Dock and will be completed soon. It will depart for Sandakan on the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>(Shanghai Correspondent) On the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" Shanghai Battle, all sports competitions in the city's Chinese sports community, such as the Private Shanghai Middle School Cup small ball game and the China Cup table tennis game, were suspended. The second match of the China-West Charity Basketball Game, originally scheduled to be held that evening, was changed to February 2nd due to the Shanghai Battle Memorial. In addition, the Women's Table Tennis Championship was inaugurated one day earlier due to the "January 28th" incident. All table tennis teams affiliated with the Shanghai Table Tennis Association fasted for one day to mark the commemoration. Various sports organizations also issued an article on the feelings about the "January 28th" commemoration and the understanding that the sports community should have in the future. It briefly stated that on the seventh anniversary of the Shanghai Battle, we deeply feel that the city's sports community should have a more thorough and further understanding of the War of Resistance, and be able to indirectly or directly enhance our strength in the War of Resistance. (1) Hold or participate in more difficult relief competitions. (2) Universally promote sports to make citizens physically fit. (3) Guide decadent youth to turn to the path of sports. (4) Strictly prevent traitorous activities in the sports community. (5) Shatter the dream of the "Sports Injury Association". All of these, it is deeply hoped that people in the sports community will rise up and shoulder the responsibility, and the future of the nation deeply relies on it.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Hong Kong Inter-City Football Team, Ideal Representatives in the Eyes of Foreigners, Remy Dee is Considered Worthy of the Right Inside Forward Position <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>(Our Special News) Recently, Hong Kong fans have been concerned about the selection of representatives for the Hong Kong-Philippines inter-city football competition. Yesterday, I read an article in the Western Evening News by the sports reporter with the pen name "Abe," who also proposed a lineup. The intention is probably that since there is not much time left before the inter-city competition, even if the Football Association already has a plan for the selection of personnel, it is not as good as announcing it as soon as possible so that joint trial matches can be held as soon as possible to achieve the effect of communication. According to the lineup he proposed:</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan (South China Chinese)</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng (South China Southern) Remy Dee (St. Joseph's)</p>
<p>Shi Dilu (Navy Team) Biludu (St. Joseph's) Di Chen (Navy Team) Liang Rongzhao (South China Southern)</p>
<p>Hou Chengtu (Oriental Club) Gaoshan (St. Joseph's) Li Huitang (South China Southern) Feng Jingxiang (South China Southern) Deng Guangsen (South China Southern)</p>
<p>The reason for selecting this team is roughly that although there are still good goalkeepers in Hong Kong, such as Heli, Bao Jiaping, and Heather of the Navy, in his observation, these two are not as stable and reliable as Tan. Li Dasheng's position as left inside forward is beyond doubt, but with Watson not available, Remy Dee is the only other person who can fill that position. Mai Shaohan is used to cooperating with Li, but not as good as Remy's footwork. As for the center backs, Liang Rongzhao, Biludu, and Di Chen are all good, but Liang can fill the right forward position, so it is recommended that Liang play on the right and either Bi or Di play in the center. The left forward is believed to be none other than Shi Dilu. The use of Li, Feng, and Gao as the three inside forwards is the unanimous choice of everyone. As for Hou Chengtu, although he is often suspected of committing offside violations to hinder the overall attacking power, looking around at the left wing in Hong Kong today, there is no one as fast and good at dribbling and shooting as him. Luo Douwen has had excellent performances before, but he seems to be degenerating, so Hou is recommended instead of Luo. Deng Guangsen is recommended for the right wing because he has been performing well recently and is very capable of cooperating with Feng Jingxiang. (Fei Ersheng)</p>

However, most of the spectators praised Tang and others for their extraordinary skills.</p>
<p>Today at 4 pm, they plan to practice with Dezi and Piasi at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. However, Defu must give a definite reply at 9 am today. If Defu does not have space today, they will meet tomorrow instead.</p>
<p>Li and others have been practicing hard for the past few days. If they have practice today, they will rest tomorrow to regain their energy and prepare for the battle against the University of Hong Kong the day after tomorrow. If they practice tomorrow, they will rest today. (Dong Lang)</p>

Chairman Huang Yugen delivered the opening remarks, stating that in order to develop sports, one must be physically fit, and then promote social sports. If one is not strong, one cannot develop the spirit of sports. Therefore, the association should strive to strengthen itself and be responsible for raising the level of sports in Hong Kong.

<h3 id="e80">Movies and Drama <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Entertainment... Wild Country Scenery</p>
<p>South Riding</p>
<p>British films have made great progress in recent years. Like "Drums Along the Mohawk," which was screened in Hong Kong on New Year's Day, and this film, are excellent examples. "Wild Country Scenery" is a famous literary work. The author, Winifred Holtby, was a writer who cared very much about social and political issues. The film depicts a typical English village, where there are stubborn and luxurious landowners who are gradually declining, and villagers suffering from poverty and disease, as well as a large number of children who have no opportunity to be educated, living in dirty and unsanitary places. The film also depicts a group of people who are devoted to social causes, how they work hard to transform the village, and at the same time expose the hypocrisy of those who only talk nicely, but are unable to take responsibility for their own actions.</p>
<p>The main actors, such as Anna Neagle and Ralph Richardson, also gave excellent and refined performances. The other actors also had considerable achievements.</p>
<p>Queen... Death Ray Explosion Machine</p>
<p>Arrest Bulldog Drummond</p>
<p>There have been several films about special detectives before, but each has an independent story. Now, in this "Death Ray Explosion Machine," except for H.E. Warner replacing John Barrymore, there are not many changes in the cast. Among all the Bulldog Drummond detective films, this one has a more tortuous and thrilling story. The story depicts Bulldog Drummond on the eve of his wedding, when a professor who is also his friend is assassinated. The professor is an inventor who is working on the invention of a death ray explosion machine. Drummond, eager to avenge his friend and concerned about national defense, tries hard to track down the enemy, goes through all kinds of dangers, and finally catches the villains in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The plot of the whole film is tense and lively. John Howard plays the detective with vigor. The acting skills of the other actors are also unique.</p>
<p>Peace... The Secret History of a Young Widow</p>
<p>That Certain Woman</p>
<p>It is a work in which Bette Davis and Henry Fonda cooperated again after "That Certain Woman." This film is now being shown for the second time in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The story tells a sad story. Bette plays a widowed woman who works. She falls in love with a man, but because the man's father strongly opposes it, the marriage cannot be completed, but unfortunately she is pregnant. Soon she gives birth to a child. Later, the man marries another woman in Paris. Then the woman injures her leg and becomes disabled. At the same time, out of sympathy for her husband and the child born to the widow, she sacrifices her love and lets them reconcile forever.</p>
<p>The tragic atmosphere of the whole film is quite strong. Several climaxes also have the power to manipulate the audience's emotions. Bette Davis plays a widow who is heavily oppressed by the social environment, and gives a profound and moving performance. Henry Fonda is also very competent.</p>
<p>Oriental... True Love Between Mother and Son</p>
<p>Of Human Hearts</p>
<p>It depicts a family tragedy. The father is a clergyman who sacrifices everything for religion, but his son opposes this work, thinking that being a doctor is more practical than being a priest. So after a fierce argument, the son leaves home to study medicine. Later, the old father dies, and the mother sacrifices everything for her son's education expenses. By the time he graduates, the civil war breaks out. The relief work makes him feel very interested. Because he felt that the family had left him with a bad impression, he forgot his old mother. It was not until someone criticized him that he felt ashamed and returned to his mother's arms.</p>
<p>The whole film is very tragic. Although this film is not a war film, the scenes of war and rescue are also quite spectacular. Several of the main actors seem a bit unfamiliar to us, but their performances do not disappoint.</p>
<p>Dahua... The Wise Judge</p>
<p>Judge Hardy's Children</p>
<p>The structure of the story is no different from "You Can't Take It With You." It writes that Hardy was called back to the capital by the government to preside over affairs, so the family moved from the countryside to Washington. Unfortunately, Hardy was deceived by a friend, and his daughter, Mary, was almost misled by vanity and deceived by someone. His son, Andrew, also has a very humorous romance. In the end, he returns to his hometown and lives a free life.</p>
<p>Director George Seitz handles this ordinary educational story with very delicate techniques, and the characters are vividly portrayed on the screen. And some of the interjections and dialogues in it make the audience feel particularly interested. In terms of actors, the most successful is Mickey Rooney. Cecilia Parker is also very cute. The other supporting roles are all competent.</p>
<p>New World... Women's World</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>The plot describes the story of a group of female boarders in a women's apartment. This apartment contains all kinds of characters. They all have their own occupations, but they are complicated. Among them are female students, female reporters, female saleswomen, singers, female dancers... The careers of all urban women are almost completely included here. The women are gossiping, and they all have their own experiences. It is no exaggeration to say that she is a microcosm of women in the city. However, because the plot of the whole drama lacks the contrast of men, it seems very lax and forced, and cannot arouse the audience's interest. At the same time, this film can only depict the ordinary private lives of ordinary women, such as quarrels over rouge and powder, but it has never written about the description of women in general. This is really the only reason for the failure of this film. In the end, because the apartment was bombed, all the women realized it and united to go to the front line, which also seemed unnatural and formulaic. However, even though that's how it is said, we have to forgive the writers and directors for making a play with all women, which is also a very difficult thing.</p>
<p>Central... Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>The audience who has seen the previous episode will always remember that at the end, Zhou Zhicheng still stole a pair of Golden Chrysanthemums. Now, the sequel starts from this incident and ends when the Golden Chrysanthemums are returned. The plot is not as tense and tortuous as the previous episode, and the performance is also very lax, but there are still many places in the middle that can win the tears of some stupid audiences, such as Kuang Shanxiao being framed and imprisoned, and Xiao Yanfei visiting the prison. The consistent style of folk stories is still unavoidable. We don't need to see it to guess the plot of the film. Sure enough, this ideal is not wrong. Cao Qiwen is not suitable for acting in this kind of film. The scenery and photography are okay in South China, but the sound recording is a failure.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Beware of Smokescreens <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>Recently, two rather bizarre pieces of news have emerged in international affairs:</p>
<p>First, German staff officers praised the power of the Soviet Red Army.</p>
<p>Second, unofficial German propaganda touted the improvement of Soviet-German relations, claiming the Anti-Comintern Pact would become a scrap of paper. Are these credible?</p>
<p>Our observation is as follows:</p>
<p>First, Germany has consistently warned its ally Japan not to exhaust its military strength in China, so as not to weaken the anti-Soviet forces, which is in line with the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Japanese military insisted on going its own way, deeply penetrating our inland areas and engaging in long-term warfare. Germany is very likely using this as a veiled warning.</p>
<p>Second, after the Munich Agreement, relations between the Soviet Union and small countries in Southeastern Europe, especially with Poland and Romania, became increasingly close. Germany is very likely feigning friendliness with the Soviet Union to carry out activities of division and disintegration.</p>
<p>Third, the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact has recently been brought up again, saying it is still valid. At the same time, the anti-fascist wave among governments and the masses in various democratic countries is intensifying. Germany is very likely releasing this kind of air to ease the anti-fascist wave.</p>
<p>Fourth, the astonishing actions of the three aggressors of Germany, Japan, and Italy in the near future have become a widely shared perception. Japanese envoys to various European countries have recently been frequently meeting in Paris, attempting to turn the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. Isn't it possible that Germany's move is also a smokescreen?</p>
<p>Fifth, it is also possible that it is a diplomatic trick orchestrated by Japanese warlords, because after the Wang Jingwei faction, which advocated taking the anti-communist route and following the German-Italian route, was purged, the Japanese warlords said that the Chinese government was completely pro-Soviet and anti-German-Italian. However, now that the Soviet Union is also "seeing Germany," aren't the views of the Wang Jingwei types correct? In fact, such a conspiracy will never work. (But it is necessary to guard against elements using anti-communism as a cover to swagger and deceive!)</p>
<p>Sixth, Germany wants to invade Ukraine. Germany knows about the intense popular sentiment in the Soviet Union. Therefore, Germany's move may also be a smokescreen to suppress Soviet morale.</p>
<p>The above is about the German side.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union, its national foundation is as solid as a rock. It does not fear invasion by others, whether from the East or the West. As Defense Commissar Voroshilov said, we will certainly eliminate the invaders in other people's territory. The Zhanggufeng Incident has proven this statement. But it has consistently adopted a policy of peace, and the spirit of this policy is the same for democratic countries and fascist countries: to eliminate war. Therefore, it also maintains diplomatic relations and trade relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan, and has even proposed to Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty. However, to say that the Soviet Union's policy is a compromise, and that socialism is almost the same as Nazism and Fascism, is simply a joke and extremely absurd. The Soviet Union is the most sincere advocate of world peace, and the most sincere aid to oppressed nations in their struggle for liberation. If Nazi Germany is really interested in improving Soviet-German relations, the Soviet Union will certainly be happy to accept it. But if it uses this mask to carry out some kind of conspiracy, the shrewd and capable politicians of the Soviet Union will never take the bait. This point, I am afraid, the invaders themselves understand better than we do.</p>
<p>After the sudden change in the Western War, a sudden atmosphere of Soviet-German amity appeared, and Hitler's important speech in the Reichstag on the 30th of last month, in which he "decided the fate of the world," clearly expressed demands for colonies, supported Italy's future aggressive actions, and supported Japan's position on invading China. Then, isn't "Sima Zhao's heart" "known to everyone"?</p>
<h3 id="e83">Lost Lambs <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Shuoyan</p>
<p>On a cold winter night, there was not a single cloud in the sky. A bright moon, lined with a few scattered stars, shone down lonely and coldly, hypnotizing everything into dreamland. The roads and rooftops were all dyed a silver-white, and the night was very quiet.</p>
<p>The biting cold wind howled, and the clear sound of the bells from a distant church aroused the feelings of the wanderers. A group of lost lambs, their lives like grains of sand in a storm, like duckweed on the vast sea, forever drifting in the wind and in the water!</p>
<p>On the unfamiliar roads of a foreign land, all the faces are strangers, and the homeland shattered by artillery fire is often recalled as a sad dream!</p>
<p>Where is the final resting place for wanderers?</p>
<p>When will the life of escape come to an end?</p>
<p>Tearful sadness is hidden in the old man's eyes!</p>
<p>The children cry with hunger, stroking their empty stomachs with their small hands!</p>
<p>In the homeland, in that green countryside, there is a quiet river, flowing gurglingly. Many delicate willows grow by the river, swaying in the breeze. This natural picture is linked to my unforgettable memories. Now, now! The iron hooves of the invaders have trampled on the green fields, and the neighing of warhorses has shattered the peaceful dreams of thousands of families. Under the remains of artillery fire, only a scene of sorrow and desolation is left.</p>
<p>The sky above the wilderness is empty, hiding a group of lost lambs. They have no delicate gold velvet blankets, heron down quilts, or elastic "sofa" beds. They only have a "genuine" burlap sack and a few scraps of old newspaper. They fall asleep under the urge of fatigue. The blue sky is their tent, and the straw thatch is their bed. The howling of the north wind is considered a mournful lullaby! Everyone rejoices at escaping from the tiger's mouth, but doubts about tomorrow's life.</p>
<p>However, what they encounter, apart from ridicule, disdain, cold sarcasm, and hot irony... a string of sharp pricks, who will sympathize? Take pity?</p>
<p>The life of exile, the dust of foreign lands, arouses infinite sadness in the heart.</p>
<p>In the silent midnight, a group of lost lambs in the wind has awakened! They know that survival requires struggle, so they are firmly searching for the path of light to move forward.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Pen <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Yu</p>
<p>In an era of腥風血雨(bloodshed), it is not allowed for Sakyamuni to advocate those ways that can make human beings become Buddhas, because such corrupt melodies as "put down the butcher knife and become a Buddha immediately" are absolutely not suitable for this era. It is very obvious that today's China is the dividing line of all rises and falls, and also the critical moment of all life and death. In order to win the needs that the whole people need, it is natural to start the massacre of the national struggle. There are two objects of massacre in China at present: one is to destroy the strong enemy of all mankind, and the other is to eliminate the scum of the whole nation; and these two points can also be said: the former is internal, and the latter is external.</p>
<p>However, what are the tools for killing people?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, what the soldiers hold in their hands are knives and guns, steel and sulfur; but all that the literati hold in their hands is only a pen tip that is only an inch long.</p>
<p>Don't think that the pen is a useless thing, it can only write about the Romance of the Western Chamber, Dream of the Red Chamber, Golden Lotus, write about smiling too much, write about three men and three women-style romances; similarly, it can also kill people. The pen in history has long been used as a tool for killing people, and the killing work of the pen at that time may be called the pen. Isn't it? "Others carry swords, I have a pen like a knife," how loud and happy it is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although the pen in history can kill people, the object of killing is not wide and not many; the crimes of the killed are not clear; even wrong is right and wrong is wrong, and there are even wrongful killings. In addition, because the killing is not done properly, it is often the case that it cannot be performed vividly and thoroughly, and to the satisfaction of the people. Are these all the mistakes of the pen? Of course not, just because the person who uses it lacks a little observation, lacks a little trick. Therefore, although the pen can be regarded as a sharp weapon for killing people, the problem still lies in the skill of the person holding the pen; the situation is similar, any knife and gun can kill people, and the final key is to follow the killing method adopted by the executioner.</p>
<p>Now, fresh blood has stained the rivers and mountains, and the massacre has long begun. Whether external or internal, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor should stand firm in their posts and perform this sacred task. Then the authors who stand on the cultural front should not forget the responsibility of using the pen instead of the knife.</p>
<p>Look: those things that put on airs; those things that wag their tails; those things that pretend to be ghosts; and those things that look like human beings but are not... All must use the sharp tip of the pen to dissect their abdomen, reveal the secrets in their hearts, cut off their heads, and pour out the darkness of their heads. Authors must absolutely use the pen, so that all ugly monsters and demons will show their original shape when they see it, and dare not be rampant from now on. Let the pen add some historical merits to the massacre of the national struggle, and at the same time let the pen cultivate a little brilliant embellishment on the journey of Chinese culture!</p>
<h3 id="e86">Random Memories of Vietnam <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— A Chinese Traveler</p>
<p>Tired of Hearing About Defeats</p>
<p>After the outbreak of war, our supreme leader once admonished the people of the country:</p>
<p>"Do not be arrogant when you hear of victory, and do not be discouraged when you hear of defeat?" This simply means teaching people to face the battle calmly.</p>
<p>In a certain provincial capital in Indochina, lived an old man (a Vietnamese) who changed it to:</p>
<p>"Be happy when you hear of victory, and do not speak of defeat," as a joke.</p>
<p>It is said that if anyone went to the old man's house to report Chinese military setbacks, he would immediately be thrown out. He said that although he was not Chinese, he loved China very much! He did not want to hear that the China he loved was being defeated, which is the meaning of "do not speak of defeat."</p>
<p>As for other ordinary Annamese people, although they do not love China as passionately as the old poet, when they hear of the × people's inhumane slaughter of peace-loving Chinese, especially when they see in illustrated magazines buildings destroyed by the × people and innocent civilians lying dismembered all over the ground, they sigh and say: Is this how civilized people behave? Feeling a great sense of: "When will this end? We and you will all perish!"—Regarding this, just look at the article "The Sino-Japanese War and Us" signed by Ge Yuan in a certain French newspaper in Hanoi on November 7th of last year, where he openly declared: "China is fighting Japan for us." From this, one can see what kind of attitude they take towards these lovers of slaughter.</p>
<p>Anonymous Donations</p>
<p>When you take a military vehicle from Saigon to Cholon, after the tram has been running for a few seconds, if you look out of the left window of the vehicle, you can see a particularly eye-catching flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flying high in front of a Western-style building, sandwiched between several towering coconut trees. That is the Consulate General of our Republic of China in Saigon. Under this flag, the iron gate that is open, every day, many Annamese people with exposed faces and anonymous names, bring paper money from the Banque de l'Indochine and donate it to our consulate—why do they give this precious money to the staff of our consulate? And why do they expose their faces but still remain anonymous? From the former point of view, it is of course that they sympathize with our war of resistance! Especially protesting against the robbery of the × people! From the latter point of view! They really have unspeakable suffering! This is very different from the meaning when we casually write "Anonymous" when donating money.</p>
<p>Martial Arts Drama on the Street</p>
<p>I can't remember the date and place clearly, but this incident happened in a certain commercial port in Annam.</p>
<p>It was when the sun was taking weary steps, waving goodbye to everything on the earth, that many people gathered on a certain street, as if competing to watch some kind of magic trick. It turned out that two people who did not know better were performing a martial arts drama there. Because of the crowd, the street police came over with batons in their hands. The roles of the martial arts drama also stopped performing because of the arrival of the street police. Their clothes were torn, and their faces were covered with bloody wounds. In this way, they were taken to the police station based on some signs!</p>
<p>"Why are you fighting?" the official asked.</p>
<p>"We were debating the Sino-Japanese War," the Chinese prisoner said.</p>
<p>"Debating the Sino-Japanese War, why did it lead to fighting?" the official asked again.</p>
<p>"He said that the final victory belongs to China, I didn't agree, so I had a conflict with him!" the Annamese prisoner said.</p>
<p>"Get out of here, he is Chinese, of course he hopes China will win the war. The final victory belongs to them. You are not Japanese, why don't you agree with what he said?" the official said angrily, and slapped the Annamese prisoner! At the same time, he also sentenced him to three weeks in prison. After receiving praise for his patriotism, the Chinese man finally left the police station with a smile.</p>
<p>A Slight Sigh</p>
<p>One afternoon, my wife and I accompanied a friend from Guangzhou named Tan to the zoo to play. Although we were in a foreign country, our hearts were in our homeland. We also grieved for the soldiers fighting the × people on the front lines, and at the same time hated the × people's indiscriminate bombing of our many undefended cities. Therefore, the subject of our conversation was focused on the Sino-Japanese War. Although we were speaking Cantonese, the coachman (Vietnamese) sitting in front seemed to understand a little, and turned his head to me and said:</p>
<p>"Japan is really too arrogant, but unfortunately, this time it bumped into a nose full of ashes! Let's see how fierce he can be for a few more days?"</p>
<p>I felt very strange after hearing this, so I asked him in Annamese: "Why do you see that the Japanese have bumped into a nose full of ashes?"</p>
<p>"Didn't the Japanese military say so? The China Incident can be resolved in just a few months. Now it has been fought for more than a year, gathered the country's elites, and besieged Hankou for several months, but still can't see any hope (at that time, Hankou had not yet been abandoned). From this point, we can see Japan's fatigue. Secondly, taking Annam as an example, before the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Japanese people here were so aggressive, it was really invincible! Now, has the French government seen the flaws?"</p>
<p>"What flaws have they seen?" I interrupted him and asked.</p>
<p>"In the past, Japanese rogues often caused trouble here. Whenever an accident happened, the colonial government mostly accommodated them, fearing conflict with them: now it is very different. If they do something that harms order, the colonial government will expel them without hesitation. Looking at it this way, isn't this the loss suffered from abusing force?" After he finished speaking, he sighed for the imminent decline of the nouveau riche, and we couldn't help but sigh slightly for it.</p>
